printed
in
a
preface
this
book
is
made
up
of
a
series
of
articles
originally
published
in
the
it
was
compiled
to
establish
one
point
and
only
one
namely
that
the
german
government
was
not
solely
guilty
of
bringing
on
the
war
i
have
not
been
at
all
concerned
with
measuring
the
german
share
of
guilt
with
trying
to
show
that
it
was
either
great
or
small
or
that
it
was
either
less
or
more
than
that
of
any
other
government
or
association
of
governments
all
this
is
beside
the
point
i
do
not
by
any
means
wish
to
escape
the
responsibility
of
saying
that
i
think
the
german
government
share
of
guilt
in
the
matter
is
extremely
small
so
small
by
comparison
with
that
of
the
major
powers
allied
against
germany
as
to
be
inconsiderable
that
is
my
belief
demonstrable
as
i
think
by
such
evidence
as
has
now
become
available
to
any
candid
person
but
this
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
of
this
volume
if
the
guilt
of
the
german
government
could
be
proved
to
be
ten
times
greater
than
it
was
represented
to
be
by
the
of
the
allied
powers
the
conclusion
established
in
the
following
chapters
would
still
remain
guilty
as
the
german
government
may
have
been
multiply
by
ten
any
estimate
that
any
person
interested
or
disinterested
informed
or
uninformed
may
put
upon
its
guilt
the
fact
remains
that
it
was
far
very
far
indeed
from
being
the
only
guilty
party
concerned
if
there
were
no
practical
end
to
be
gained
by
establishing
this
conclusion
if
one
purpose
were
only
to
give
the
german
government
the
dubious
vindication
of
a
the
effort
would
be
hardly
worth
making
but
as
i
say
at
the
outset
there
is
at
stake
an
extremely
important
matter
one
that
will
unfavourably
affect
the
peace
of
the
world
for
at
least
a
generation
the
treaty
of
versailles
if
the
german
government
may
not
be
assumed
to
be
solely
responsible
for
the
war
this
treaty
is
indefensible
for
it
is
constructed
wholly
upon
that
assumption
it
becomes
not
a
treaty
but
a
verdict
pronounced
after
the
manner
of
brennus
by
a
superior
power
which
without
regard
to
justice
arrogates
to
itself
the
functions
of
prosecutor
jury
and
judge
it
is
probably
superfluous
to
point
out
that
this
treaty
conceived
in
the
pure
spirit
of
the
victorious
apache
has
in
practice
utterly
broken
down
it
has
not
worked
and
it
will
not
work
because
it
sets
at
defiance
certain
economic
laws
which
are
as
inexorable
as
the
law
of
gravitation
the
incidence
of
these
laws
was
well
understood
and
clearly
foretold
at
the
time
of
the
by
an
informed
minority
in
europe
notably
by
maynard
keynes
in
his
volume
entitled
the
economic
consequences
of
the
peace
in
this
country
also
a
minority
sufficiently
informed
to
know
its
right
hand
from
its
left
in
economic
affairs
stood
aghast
in
contemplation
of
the
ruinous
consequences
which
it
perceived
as
inevitable
under
any
serious
attempt
to
put
this
vicious
instrument
into
operation
but
both
here
and
in
europe
this
minority
was
very
small
and
uninfluential
and
could
accomplish
nothing
against
the
ignorant
and
unreasoning
bad
temper
which
the
politicians
kept
aflame
the
treaty
had
therefore
to
go
to
the
test
of
experiment
and
of
the
results
of
this
one
need
surely
say
nothing
for
they
are
obvious
the
harder
germany
tried
to
fulfill
the
conditions
of
the
treaty
and
the
nearer
she
came
to
doing
so
the
worse
things
went
in
all
the
countries
that
were
presumably
to
benefit
by
her
sacrifice
the
central
empires
are
as
the
informed
minority
in
all
countries
has
been
from
the
beginning
anxiously
aware
the
in
the
whole
of
european
industry
and
commerce
if
they
must
work
and
trade
under
unfavourable
conditions
they
also
thereby
automatically
impose
correspondingly
unfavourable
conditions
upon
the
whole
of
europe
and
correspondingly
unfavourable
conditions
are
thereby
in
turn
automatically
set
up
wherever
the
trade
of
europe
reaches
for
example
in
the
united
states
there
is
now
no
possible
doubt
about
this
for
one
has
but
to
glance
at
the
enormous
dislocations
of
international
commerce
and
the
universal
and
profound
stagnation
of
industry
in
order
to
prove
it
to
complete
satisfaction
germany
wisely
and
made
a
sincere
and
vigourous
effort
to
comply
with
the
conditions
of
the
treaty
and
by
so
doing
she
has
carried
the
rest
of
the
world
to
the
verge
of
economic
collapse
the
damage
wrought
by
the
war
was
in
general
of
a
spectacular
and
impressive
type
and
was
indeed
very
great
no
one
would
minimize
it
but
the
damage
present
and
prospective
wrought
by
the
treaty
of
peace
is
much
greater
and
more
the
political
inheritors
of
those
who
made
the
peace
are
now
extremely
uneasy
about
it
their
predecessors
including
lloyd
george
who
still
remains
in
office
had
flogged
up
popular
hatred
against
the
central
empires
at
such
a
rate
that
when
they
took
office
they
still
had
or
thought
they
had
to
court
and
indulge
this
hatred
thus
we
found
secretary
hughes
for
example
in
his
first
communication
to
the
german
government
laying
it
down
that
the
basis
of
the
versailles
treaty
was
sound
that
germany
was
solely
responsible
for
the
war
he
spoke
of
it
quite
in
the
vein
of
lloyd
george
as
a
after
having
promulgated
the
treaty
with
such
immense
ceremony
and
raised
such
preposterous
and
extravagant
popular
expectations
on
the
strength
of
it
the
architects
of
the
treaty
bequeathed
an
exceedingly
difficult
task
to
their
successors
the
task
of
letting
the
public
down
diverting
their
attention
with
this
or
that
gesture
taking
their
mind
off
their
disappointments
and
scaling
down
their
expectations
so
that
in
time
it
might
be
safe
to
let
the
versailles
treaty
begin
to
sink
out
of
sight
the
task
is
being
undertaken
the
curious
piece
of
mountebankery
recently
staged
in
washington
for
example
was
an
ambitious
effort
to
keep
the
peoples
particularly
those
of
europe
hopeful
confiding
and
diverted
and
if
economic
conditions
permit
if
times
do
not
become
too
hard
it
may
succeed
the
politicians
can
not
say
outright
that
the
theory
of
the
versailles
treaty
is
dishonest
and
outrageous
and
that
the
only
chance
of
peace
and
is
by
tearing
up
the
treaty
and
starting
anew
on
another
basis
entirely
they
can
not
say
this
on
account
of
the
exigencies
of
their
detestable
trade
the
best
that
they
can
do
is
what
they
are
doing
they
must
wait
until
the
state
of
public
feeling
permits
them
to
ease
down
from
their
uncompromising
stand
upon
the
treaty
gradually
they
expect
the
public
will
accustom
itself
to
the
idea
of
relaxations
and
accommodations
as
it
sees
from
day
to
day
the
patent
impracticability
of
any
other
course
feelings
will
weaken
asperities
soften
hatreds
die
out
contacts
and
approaches
of
one
kind
or
another
will
take
place
and
finally
these
public
men
or
their
political
inheritors
will
think
themselves
able
to
effect
in
an
unobtrusive
way
such
substantial
modifications
of
the
treaty
of
versailles
as
will
amount
to
its
annulment
the
process
is
worth
accelerating
by
every
means
possible
and
what
i
have
here
done
is
meant
to
assist
it
there
are
many
persons
in
the
country
who
are
not
politicians
and
who
are
capable
and
desirous
of
approaching
a
matter
of
this
kind
with
intellectual
honesty
quite
possibly
they
are
not
aware
many
of
them
that
the
versailles
treaty
postulates
the
sole
responsibility
of
the
german
government
for
bringing
on
the
war
undoubtedly
they
are
not
acquainted
with
such
evidence
as
i
have
here
compiled
to
show
that
this
assumption
is
unjust
and
erroneous
having
read
this
evidence
they
will
be
in
a
position
to
review
the
terms
of
the
versailles
treaty
and
reassess
the
justice
of
those
terms
they
will
also
be
able
to
understand
the
unwillingness
the
inability
of
the
german
people
to
acquiesce
in
those
terms
and
they
can
comprehend
the
slowness
and
difficulty
wherewith
peace
and
good
feeling
are
being
in
europe
and
the
extreme
precariousness
and
uncertainty
of
europe
situation
and
our
own
in
consequence
throughout
a
future
that
seems
longer
than
one
cares
to
contemplate
the
reader
will
perceive
at
once
that
this
book
is
a
mere
compilation
and
transcription
of
fact
containing
not
a
shred
of
opinion
or
of
any
original
matter
on
this
account
it
was
published
anonymously
in
its
serial
form
because
it
seemed
to
me
that
such
work
should
be
judged
strictly
as
it
stands
without
regard
to
the
authority
or
lack
of
authority
which
the
compiler
might
happen
to
possess
almost
all
of
it
is
lifted
straight
from
the
works
of
my
friends
francis
neilson
and
morel
i
earnestly
hope
indeed
it
is
my
chief
motive
in
publishing
this
book
that
it
may
serve
as
an
introduction
to
these
words
i
can
not
place
too
high
an
estimate
upon
their
importance
to
a
student
of
british
and
continental
diplomacy
they
are
as
far
as
i
know
alone
in
their
field
nothing
else
can
take
their
place
they
are
so
thorough
so
exhaustive
and
so
authoritative

i

at
their

the
myth
of
a
guilty
nation
i
the
present
course
of
events
in
europe
is
impressing
on
us
once
more
the
truth
that
military
victory
if
it
is
to
stand
must
also
be
demonstrably
a
victory
for
justice
in
the
long
run
victory
must
appeal
to
the
sense
of
justice
in
the
conquered
no
less
than
in
the
conquerors
if
it
is
to
be
effective
there
is
no
way
of
getting
around
this
gilbert
chesterton
is
right
when
he
says
that
if
the
south
had
not
finally
accepted
the
outcome
of
the
civil
war
as
being
on
the
whole
just
lincoln
would
have
been
wrong
in
trying
to
preserve
the
union
which
is
only
another
way
of
expressing
lincoln
own
homely
saying
that
nothing
is
ever
really
settled
until
it
is
settled
right
the
present
condition
of
europe
is
largely
due
to
the
fact
that
the
official
peacemakers
have
not
taken
into
their
reckoning
the
german
sense
of
justice
their
mistake
it
was
also
wilson
great
mistake
was
in
their
disregard
of
what
bismarck
called
the
imponderabilia
the
terms
of
the
peace
treaty
plainly
reflect
this
mistake
that
is
largely
the
reason
why
the
treaty
is
inoperative
and
worthless
that
is
largely
why
the
governments
of
europe
are
confronted
with
the
inescapable
alternative
they
can
either
tear
up
the
treaty
and
replace
it
by
an
understanding
based
on
justice
or
they
can
stick
to
the
treaty
and
by
so
doing
protract
indefinitely
the
dismal
succession
of
wars
revolutions
bankruptcies
and
commercial
dislocations
that
the
treaty
inaugurated
that
is
the
situation
and
it
is
a
situation
in
which
the
people
of
the
united
states
have
an
interest
to
preserve
the
primary
interest
of
a
creditor
and
also
the
interest
of
a
trader
who
needs
a
large
and
stable
market
it
is
idle
to
suppose
that
american
business
can
prosper
so
long
as
europe
remains
in
a
condition
of
instability
and
insolvency
our
business
is
adjusted
to
the
scale
of
a
solvent
europe
and
it
can
not
be
readjusted
without
irreparable
damage
until
certain
matters
connected
with
the
war
are
resolutely
put
under
review
europe
can
not
be
reconstructed
and
the
united
states
can
not
be
prosperous
the
only
thing
that
can
better
our
own
situation
is
the
resumption
of
normal
economic
life
in
europe
and
this
can
be
done
only
through
a
thorough
reconsideration
of
the
injustices
that
have
been
put
upon
the
german
people
by
the
conditions
of
the
armistice
and
the
peace
treaty
of
these
injustices
the
greatest
because
it
is
the
foundation
for
all
the
rest
is
the
imputation
of
germany
sole
responsibility
for
the
war
the
german
people
will
never
endure
that
imputation
they
should
never
be
expected
to
endure
it
nothing
can
really
be
settled
until
the
question
of
responsibility
is
openly
and
candidly
and
an
understanding
established
that
is
based
on
facts
instead
of
on
official
misrepresentation
this
question
is
by
no
means
one
of
abstract
justice
alone
or
of
chivalry
and
fair
play
towards
a
defeated
enemy
it
is
a
question
of
immediate
and
urgent
however
it
may
be
regarded
by
the
american
sense
of
justice
and
fair
play
it
remains
to
the
eye
of
american
industry
and
commerce
a
straight
question
of
dollars
and
cents
the
prosperity
of
the
united
states
as
we
are
beginning
to
see
hangs
upon
the
economic
of
europe
europe
can
not
possibly
be
settled
upon
the
present
terms
of
peace
and
these
terms
can
not
be
changed
without
first
vacating
the
theory
of
germany
sole
responsibility
because
it
is
upon
this
theory
that
the
treaty
of
versailles
was
built
this
theory
therefore
must
be
in
the
light
of
evidence
that
the
allied
and
associated
governments
have
done
their
best
either
to
ignore
or
to
suppress
hence
for
the
american
people
the
way
to
prosperity
lies
through
a
searching
and
honest
examination
of
this
theory
that
has
been
so
deeply
implanted
in
their
mind
the
theory
of
a
plotting
in
solitude
to
achieve
the
mastery
of
the
world
by
fire
and
sword
americans
however
come
reluctantly
to
the
task
of
this
examination
for
two
reasons
first
we
are
all
tired
of
the
war
we
hate
to
think
of
it
or
of
anything
connected
with
it
and
as
far
as
possible
we
keep
it
out
of
our
minds
second
nearly
every
reputation
of
any
consequence
in
this
country
political
clerical
academic
and
journalistic
is
already
committed
head
over
ears
to
the
validity
of
this
theory
how
many
of
our
politicians
are
there
whose
reputations
are
not
bound
up
inextricably
with
this
legend
of
a
german
plot
how
many
of
our
managed
to
preserve
detachment
enough
under
the
pressure
of
to
be
able
to
come
forward
and
say
that
the
question
of
responsibility
for
the
war
should
be
how
can
the
liberals
and
ask
for
such
an
inquest
when
they
were
all
swept
off
their
feet
by
the
specious
plea
that
war
was
a
different
war
from
all
other
wars
in
the
history
of
mankind
what
can
our
ministers
of
religion
say
after
the
unreserved
endorsement
that
they
put
upon
the
sanctity
of
the
allied
cause
what
can
our
educators
say
after
having
served
so
zealously
the
ends
of
the
official
propagandists
from
our
journalists
and
men
of
letters
what
can
we
expect
after
all
his
rodomontade
about
potsdam
and
the
potsdam
gang
how
could
we
expect
henry
van
dyke
for
instance
to
face
the
fact
that
the
portentous
potsdam
meeting
of
the
crown
council
on
july
took
place
at
there
is
no
use
in
trying
to
put
a
upon
human
nature
or
on
the
other
hand
in
assuming
a
pharisaic
attitude
towards
its
simplest
and
commonest
frailties
it
is
best
under
the
circumstances
merely
to
understand
that
on
this
question
every
institutional
voice
in
the
united
states
is
press
pulpit
schools
and
universities
charities
and
foundations
forums
all
are
silent
and
to
expect
them
to
break
their
silence
is
to
expect
more
than
should
be
expected
from
the
pride
of
opinion
in
average
human
nature
ii
in
examining
the
evidence
let
us
first
take
lloyd
george
own
statement
of
the
theory
except
in
one
particular
it
presents
the
case
against
germany
quite
as
it
has
been
rehearsed
by
nearly
every
institutional
voice
in
the
united
states
on
august
after
america
entry
into
the
war
the
british
premier
said
what
are
we
fighting
for
to
defeat
the
most
dangerous
conspiracy
ever
plotted
against
the
liberty
of
nations
carefully
skilfully
insidiously
clandestinely
planned
in
every
detail
with
ruthless
cynical
determination
except
for
one
point
this
statement
sums
up
what
we
have
all
heard
to
be
the
essential
doctrine
of
the
war
the
one
missing
point
in
lloyd
george
indictment
is
that
the
great
german
conspiracy
was
launched
upon
an
europe
in
europe
itself
the
official
propagandists
did
not
make
much
of
this
particular
point
for
far
too
many
people
knew
better
but
in
the
united
states
it
was
promulgated
widely
indeed
this
romance
of
allied
unpreparedness
was
an
essential
part
of
the
whole
story
of
german
responsibility
germany
so
the
official
story
ran
not
only
plotted
in
secret
but
she
sprung
her
plot
upon
a
europe
that
was
wholly
unprepared
and
unsuspecting
her
action
was
like
that
of
a
highwayman
leaping
from
ambush
upon
a
defenceless
wayfarer
belgium
was
unprepared
france
unprepared
russia
unprepared
england
unprepared
and
in
face
of
an
unprovoked
attack
these
nations
hurriedly
drew
together
in
an
extemporized
union
and
held
the
mad
dog
at
bay
with
an
extemporized
defence
until
they
could
devise
a
plan
of
common
action
and
a
pooling
of
military
and
naval
resources
such
then
is
a
fair
statement
of
the
doctrine
of
the
war
as
america
was
taught
it
next
in
order
to
show
how
fundamental
this
doctrine
is
to
the
terms
of
the
peace
treaty
let
us
consider
another
statement
of
lloyd
george
made
march
for
the
allies
german
responsibility
for
the
war
is
fundamental
it
is
the
basis
upon
which
the
structure
of
the
treaty
of
versailles
has
been
erected
and
if
that
acknowledgment
is
repudiated
or
abandoned
the
treaty
is
destroyed
we
wish
therefore
once
and
for
all
to
make
it
quite
clear
that
german
responsibility
for
the
war
must
be
treated
by
the
allies
as
a
thus
the
british
premier
explicitly
declares
that
the
treaty
of
versailles
is
based
upon
the
theory
of
germany
sole
responsibility
now
as
against
this
theory
the
main
facts
may
be
summarized
as
follows
the
british
and
french
general
staffs
had
been
in
active
collaboration
for
war
with
germany
ever
since
january
the
british
and
french
admiralty
had
been
in
similar
collaboration
the
late
lord
fisher
first
sea
lord
of
the
british
admiralty
twice
in
the
course
of
these
preparations
proposed
an
attack
upon
the
german
fleet
and
a
landing
upon
the
coast
of
pomerania
a
declaration
of
russia
had
been
preparing
for
war
ever
since
and
the
russian
and
french
general
staffs
had
come
to
a
formal
understanding
that
russian
mobilization
should
be
held
equivalent
to
a
declaration
of
war
russian
mobilization
was
begun
in
the
spring
of
under
the
guise
of
tests
and
these
tests
were
carried
on
continuously
to
the
outbreak
of
the
war
in
april
four
months
before
the
war
the
russian
and
french
naval
authorities
initiated
joint
plans
for
maritime
operations
against
germany
up
to
the
outbreak
of
the
war
germany
was
selling
grain
in
considerable
quantities
to
both
france
and
russia
it
can
not
be
shown
that
the
german
government
ever
in
a
single
instance
throughout
all
its
dealings
with
foreign
governments
demanded
or
intimated
for
germany
anything
more
than
a
position
of
economic
equality
with
other
nations
these
facts
among
others
to
which
reference
will
hereafter
be
made
have
come
to
light
only
since
the
outbreak
of
the
war
they
effectively
dispose
of
the
theory
of
an
unprepared
and
unsuspecting
europe
and
a
historical
survey
of
them
excludes
absolutely
and
stamps
as
utterly
untenable
and
preposterous
the
theory
of
a
deliberate
german
plot
against
the
peace
of
the
world
iii
let
us
now
consider
the
idea
so
generally
held
in
america
though
not
in
europe
that
in
england
and
the
continental
nations
were
not
expecting
war
and
not
prepared
for
war
the
fact
is
that
europe
was
as
thoroughly
organized
for
war
as
it
could
possibly
be
the
point
to
which
that
organization
was
carried
by
england
france
and
russia
as
compared
with
germany
and
austria
may
to
some
extent
be
indicated
by
statistics
in
russia
carried
a
military
establishment
on
a
peace
footing
of
men
france
by
an
addition
of
men
proposed
to
raise
her
to
a
total
of
germany
by
an
addition
of
men
proposed
to
raise
her
total
to
and
austria
by
additions
of
already
made
brought
her
total
up
to
these
are
the
figures
of
the
british
war
office
as
furnished
to
the
house
of
commons
in
here
is
a
set
of
figures
that
is
even
more
interesting
and
significant
from
to
the
amount
spent
on
new
naval
construction
by
england
france
and
russia
as
compared
with
germany
was
as
follows
england
france
russia
germany
these
figures
can
not
be
too
carefully
studied
by
those
who
have
been
led
to
think
that
germany
pounced
upon
a
defenceless
and
unsuspecting
europe
like
a
cat
upon
a
mouse
if
it
be
thought
worth
while
to
consider
also
the
period
of
a
few
years
preceding
one
finds
that
superiority
in
battleships
alone
was
per
cent
in
and
her
superiority
rose
to
nearly
per
cent
in
in
which
year
england
spent
on
her
navy
and
germany
taking
the
comparative
statistics
of
naval
expenditure
from
in
which
year
england
spent
on
her
navy
and
germany
spent
down
to
it
is
absolutely
impossible
to
make
the
figures
show
that
germany
enforced
upon
the
other
nations
of
europe
an
unwilling
competition
in
naval
armament
but
the
german
army
according
to
all
accounts
of
german
militarism
which
were
suffered
to
reach
these
shores
it
is
here
that
we
shall
find
evidence
of
what
lloyd
george
on
august
called
the
most
dangerous
conspiracy
ever
plotted
against
the
liberty
of
nations
carefully
skilfully
insidiously
clandestinely
planned
in
every
detail
with
ruthless
cynical
determination
well
if
one
chooses
to
hold
the
current
view
of
german
militarism
it
must
be
admitted
that
germany
had
at
her
disposal
some
miraculous
means
of
getting
something
for
nothing
getting
a
great
deal
for
nothing
in
fact
for
on
any
other
supposition
the
figures
are
far
from
supporting
that
view
in
figures
germany
and
austria
together
carried
an
of
million
england
france
and
russia
together
carried
one
of
million
england
had
no
army
it
was
said
all
her
military
strength
lay
in
her
navy
if
that
were
true
then
it
must
be
said
that
she
had
as
miraculous
a
faculty
as
germany
only
whereas
germany
was
a
faculty
for
getting
more
than
her
money
worth
england
was
for
getting
less
than
her
money
worth
for
figures
was
million
million
more
than
austria
nor
was
this
a
sudden
going
back
as
far
as
we
find
that
she
laid
out
in
that
year
the
same
amount
million
in
that
year
germany
and
austria
together
spent
million
on
their
armies
england
france
and
russia
together
spent
million
on
theirs
if
between
and
england
france
and
russia
spent
any
such
sums
upon
their
armies
as
their
statistics
show
and
nothing
came
of
it
but
an
unprepared
and
unsuspecting
europe
in
it
seems
clear
that
the
taxpayers
of
those
countries
were
swindled
on
an
inconceivably
large
scale
iv
at
this
point
some
questions
may
be
raised
why
in
the
decade
preceding
did
england
france
and
russia
arm
themselves
at
the
rate
indicated
by
the
foregoing
figures
why
did
they
accelerate
their
naval
development
progressively
from
about
million
in
to
about
million
in
why
did
russia
alone
propose
to
raise
her
military
to
an
army
of
more
than
double
the
size
of
germany
army
against
whom
were
these
preparations
directed
and
understood
to
be
directed
certainly
not
against
one
another
france
and
russia
had
been
bound
by
a
military
convention
ever
since
august
england
and
france
had
been
bound
since
january
by
a
similar
pact
and
this
was
subsequently
extended
to
include
belgium
these
agreements
will
be
considered
in
detail
hereafter
they
are
now
mentioned
merely
to
show
that
the
military
activity
in
these
countries
was
not
independent
in
purpose
france
england
russia
and
belgium
were
not
uneasy
about
one
another
and
not
arming
against
one
another
nor
is
there
any
evidence
that
anyone
thought
that
they
were
it
was
against
the
central
empires
only
that
these
preparations
were
addressed
nor
can
one
who
scans
the
table
of
relative
expenditure
easily
believe
that
the
combination
was
effected
for
purely
defensive
purposes
and
taking
the
diplomatic
history
of
the
period
in
conjunction
with
the
testimony
of
the
budgets
such
belief
becomes
impossible
v
the
british
government
is
the
one
which
was
most
often
represented
to
us
as
taken
utterly
by
surprise
by
the
german
onslaught
on
belgium
let
us
see
the
austrian
archduke
was
assassinated
june
by
three
men
who
according
to
wide
report
in
europe
and
absolute
certainty
in
america
were
secret
agents
of
the
german
government
acting
under
german
official
instruction
the
findings
of
the
court
of
inquiry
showed
that
they
were
serbs
members
of
a
organization
that
the
assassination
was
plotted
in
belgrade
and
the
weapons
with
which
it
was
committed
were
obtained
there
serbia
denied
all
connexion
with
the
assassins
the
policy
of
serbia
being
then
controlled
by
the
russian
foreign
office
and
then
the
russian
government
stepped
forward
to
prevent
the
humiliation
of
serbia
by
austria
it
is
clear
from
the
published
diplomatic
documents
that
the
british
foreign
office
knew
everything
that
took
place
between
the
assassination
and
the
burial
of
the
archduke
all
the
facts
that
is
connected
with
the
murder
the
first
dispatch
in
the
british
white
paper
is
dated
july
and
it
is
addressed
to
the
british
ambassador
at
berlin
one
wonders
why
not
to
the
ambassador
at
vienna
also
one
wonders
why
the
diplomats
apparently
found
nothing
to
write
about
for
nearly
three
weeks
between
the
archduke
funeral
and
july
it
is
a
strange
silence
sir
edward
grey
however
made
a
statement
in
the
house
of
commons
july
in
which
he
gave
the
impression
that
he
got
his
first
information
about
the
course
of
the
quarrel
between
austria
and
serbia
no
earlier
than
july
three
days
before
the
ambassador
at
vienna
sir
de
bunsen
had
notwithstanding
telegraphed
him
that
the
austrian
premier
had
given
him
no
hint
of
the
impending
storm
and
that
it
was
from
a
private
source
that
i
received
july
the
forecast
of
what
was
about
to
happen
concerning
which
i
to
you
the
following
sir
maurice
de
bunsen
telegram
on
this
important
subject
thus
evidently
was
suppressed
and
the
only
obvious
reason
for
the
suppression
is
that
it
carried
evidence
that
sir
grey
was
thoroughly
well
posted
by
july
on
what
was
taking
place
in
vienna
sir
de
bunsen
allusion
to
this
telegram
confirms
this
assumption
in
fact
it
can
be
interpreted
in
no
other
way
on
july
the
house
of
commons
was
informed
that
austria
had
declared
war
on
serbia
two
days
later
july
sir
grey
added
the
item
of
information
that
russia
had
ordered
a
partial
mobilization
which
has
not
hitherto
led
to
any
corresponding
steps
by
other
powers
so
far
as
our
information
goes
sir
grey
did
not
add
however
that
he
knew
quite
well
what
corresponding
steps
other
powers
were
likely
to
take
he
knew
the
terms
of
the
military
convention
under
which
a
mobilization
by
russia
was
to
be
held
equivalent
to
a
declaration
of
war
he
also
knew
the
terms
of
the
agreement
which
he
himself
had
authorized
although
up
to
the
eve
of
the
war
he
denied
in
reply
to
questions
in
the
house
of
commons
that
any
such
agreement
existed
and
acknowledged
it
only
on
august
he
had
promised
sazonov
the
russian
foreign
minister
in
that
in
the
event
of
germany
coming
to
austria
aid
russia
could
rely
on
great
britain
to
stake
everything
in
order
to
inflict
the
most
serious
blow
to
german
power
to
say
that
sir
grey
and
asquith
the
prime
minister
lord
haldane
the
minister
for
war
whose
own
book
has
been
a
most
tremendous
to
the
fictions
of
the
propagandists
winston
churchill
head
of
the
admiralty
who
at
dundee
june
declared
that
he
had
been
sent
to
the
admiralty
in
with
the
express
duty
laid
upon
him
by
the
prime
minister
to
put
the
fleet
in
a
state
of
instant
and
constant
readiness
for
war
to
say
that
these
men
were
taken
by
surprise
and
unprepared
is
mere
levity
austria
was
supposed
to
be
and
still
is
by
some
believed
to
have
been
germany
vassal
state
and
by
menacing
serbia
to
have
been
doing
germany
dirty
work
no
evidence
of
this
has
been
adduced
and
the
trouble
with
this
idea
of
austria
status
is
that
it
breaks
down
before
the
report
of
sir
de
bunsen
september
that
austria
finally
yielded
and
agreed
to
accept
all
the
proposals
of
the
powers
for
mediation
between
herself
and
serbia
she
made
every
concession
russian
mobilization
however
had
begun
on
july
and
become
general
four
days
later
and
it
was
not
stopped
germany
then
gave
notice
that
she
would
mobilize
her
army
if
russian
mobilization
was
not
stopped
in
twelve
hours
and
also
knowing
the
terms
of
the
convention
of
she
served
notice
on
france
giving
her
eighteen
hours
to
declare
her
position
russia
made
no
reply
france
answered
that
she
would
do
what
she
thought
best
in
her
own
interest
and
almost
at
the
moment
on
august
when
germany
ordered
a
general
mobilization
russian
troops
were
over
her
border
the
british
fleet
had
been
mobilized
for
a
week
in
the
north
sea
and
british
merchant
ships
were
lying
at
kronstadt
empty
to
convey
russian
troops
from
that
port
to
the
pomeranian
coast
in
pursuance
of
the
plan
indicated
by
lord
fisher
in
his
autobiography
recently
published
these
matters
are
well
summed
up
by
lord
loreburn
as
follows
serbia
gave
offence
to
the
empire
cause
of
just
offence
as
our
ambassador
frankly
admits
in
his
published
dispatches
we
england
had
no
concern
in
that
quarrel
as
sir
edward
grey
says
in
terms
but
russia
the
protectress
of
serbia
came
forward
to
prevent
her
being
utterly
humiliated
by
austria
we
were
not
concerned
in
that
quarrel
either
as
sir
edward
also
says
and
then
russia
called
upon
france
under
their
treaty
to
help
in
the
fight
france
was
not
concerned
in
that
quarrel
any
more
than
ourselves
as
sir
edward
informs
us
but
france
was
bound
by
a
russian
treaty
of
which
he
did
not
know
the
terms
and
then
france
called
on
us
for
help
we
were
tied
by
the
relations
which
our
foreign
office
had
created
without
apparently
realizing
that
they
had
created
them
in
saying
that
sir
grey
did
not
know
the
terms
of
the
agreement
lord
loreburn
is
generous
probably
more
generous
than
he
should
be
but
that
is
no
matter
the
thing
to
be
remarked
is
that
lord
loreburn
comes
to
something
wholly
different
from
lloyd
george
most
dangerous
conspiracy
ever
plotted
against
the
liberty
of
nations
it
comes
to
something
wholly
different
from
the
notion
implanted
in
americans
of
germany
pouncing
upon
a
peaceful
unprepared
and
unsuspecting
europe
the
german
nation
we
may
be
sure
is
keenly
aware
of
this
difference
and
therefore
any
peace
which
like
the
peace
of
versailles
is
bottomed
on
the
of
laying
the
sole
responsibility
for
the
war
at
the
door
of
the
german
nation
or
even
at
the
door
of
the
german
government
is
simply
impracticable
and
impossible
footnotes
six
months
after
the
armistice
the
bodies
of
the
three
assassins
were
dug
up
according
to
a
central
news
dispatch
from
prague
with
great
solemnity
in
the
presence
of
thousands
of
the
inhabitants
the
remains
of
serbian
are
to
be
sent
to
their
native
country
this
is
a
naïve
statement
it
remains
to
be
explained
why
these
german
agents
should
be
honoured
in
this
distinguished
way
by
the
serbs
see
footnote
to
chapter
xviii
vi
if
the
theory
upon
which
the
treaty
of
versailles
is
based
the
theory
of
a
single
guilty
nation
were
true
there
would
be
no
trouble
about
saying
what
the
war
was
fought
for
the
allied
belligerents
would
have
a
simple
straight
story
to
tell
they
could
describe
their
aims
and
intentions
clearly
in
a
few
words
that
any
one
could
understand
and
their
story
would
be
reasonably
consistent
and
not
vary
greatly
from
year
to
year
it
would
be
practically
the
same
story
in
as
in
or
at
any
time
between
in
america
indeed
the
story
did
not
greatly
vary
up
to
the
spring
of
for
the
reason
that
this
country
was
pretty
much
in
the
dark
about
european
international
relations
once
our
indignation
and
sympathies
were
aroused
it
was
for
the
propagandists
mostly
a
matter
of
keeping
them
as
hot
as
possible
few
had
the
information
necessary
to
discount
the
plain
easy
understandable
story
of
a
robber
nation
leaping
upon
an
unprepared
and
defenceless
europe
for
no
cause
whatever
except
the
lofty
ambition
as
joseph
choate
said
to
establish
a
upon
the
ruins
of
the
british
empire
those
who
had
this
information
could
not
make
themselves
heard
and
thus
it
was
that
the
propagandists
had
no
need
to
vary
the
one
story
that
was
most
useful
to
their
purpose
of
keeping
us
in
a
state
of
unreasoning
indignation
and
accordingly
they
did
not
vary
it
in
europe
and
in
england
however
the
case
was
different
international
relations
were
better
understood
by
those
who
were
closer
to
them
than
we
were
more
questions
were
raised
and
more
demands
made
hence
the
allied
politicians
and
propagandists
were
kept
busy
upon
the
defensive
when
from
time
to
time
the
voice
of
popular
discontent
or
of
some
influential
body
of
opinion
insisted
on
a
statement
of
the
causes
of
the
war
or
of
the
of
the
allies
they
were
confronted
with
the
politician
traditional
difficulty
they
had
to
say
something
plausible
and
satisfactory
which
yet
must
be
something
that
effectively
hid
the
truth
of
the
situation
as
the
war
hung
on
their
difficulty
became
desperate
and
they
threw
consistency
to
the
winds
telling
any
sort
of
story
that
would
enable
them
for
the
moment
to
get
by
the
publication
of
the
secret
treaties
which
had
been
seined
out
of
the
quagmire
of
the
old
russian
foreign
office
by
the
revolutionists
made
no
end
of
trouble
for
them
it
is
amusing
now
to
remember
how
promptly
these
treaties
were
branded
by
the
british
foreign
office
as
forgeries
especially
when
it
turned
out
that
the
actual
terms
of
the
armistice
not
the
nominal
terms
which
were
those
of
wilson
fourteen
points
but
the
actual
terms
were
the
terms
of
the
secret
treaties
the
publication
of
the
secret
treaties
in
this
country
did
not
contribute
much
towards
a
disillusionment
of
the
public
the
press
as
a
rule
ignored
or
lied
about
them
they
were
not
widely
read
and
few
who
did
read
them
had
enough
understanding
of
european
affairs
to
interpret
them
but
abroad
they
put
a
good
deal
of
fat
into
the
fire
and
this
was
a
specimen
of
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
allied
politicians
had
to
contend
with
in
their
efforts
to
keep
their
peoples
in
line
the
consequence
was
that
the
official
and
statements
of
the
causes
of
the
war
and
of
the
of
the
allies
are
a
most
curious
hotchpotch
in
fact
if
any
one
takes
stock
in
the
theory
of
the
one
guilty
nation
and
is
therefore
convinced
that
the
treaty
of
versailles
is
just
and
proper
and
likely
to
enforce
an
enduring
peace
one
could
suggest
nothing
better
than
that
he
should
go
through
the
literature
of
the
war
pick
out
these
statements
put
them
in
parallel
columns
and
see
how
they
look
if
the
war
originated
in
the
unwarranted
conspiracy
of
a
robber
nation
if
the
aims
of
the
allies
were
to
defeat
that
conspiracy
and
render
it
impotent
and
to
chastise
and
tie
the
hands
of
the
robber
nation
and
that
is
the
theory
of
the
treaty
of
versailles
can
anyone
in
his
right
mind
suppose
that
the
allied
politicians
and
propagandists
would
ever
give
out
or
need
to
give
out
these
ludicrously
contradictory
and
inconsistent
explanations
and
statements
when
one
has
a
simple
straight
story
to
tell
and
a
most
effective
story
why
complicate
it
and
undermine
it
and
throw
all
sorts
of
doubts
upon
it
by
venturing
upon
all
sorts
of
public
utterances
that
will
not
square
with
it
in
any
conceivable
way
politicians
of
all
men
never
lie
for
the
fun
of
it
their
available
margin
of
truth
is
always
so
narrow
that
they
keep
within
it
when
they
can
lloyd
george
for
example
is
one
of
the
cleverest
of
politicians
we
have
already
considered
his
two
statements
first
that
of
august
what
are
we
fighting
for
to
defeat
the
most
dangerous
conspiracy
ever
plotted
against
the
liberty
of
nations
carefully
skilfully
insidiously
clandestinely
planned
in
every
detail
with
ruthless
cynical
determination
and
then
that
of
march
for
the
allies
german
responsibility
for
the
war
is
fundamental
it
is
the
basis
upon
which
the
structure
of
the
treaty
of
versailles
has
been
erected
and
if
that
acknowledgment
is
repudiated
or
abandoned
the
treaty
is
destroyed
german
responsibility
for
the
war
must
be
treated
by
the
allies
as
a
a
little
over
two
months
before
george
made
this
latter
utterance
on
december
he
said
this
the
more
one
reads
memoirs
and
books
written
in
the
various
countries
of
what
happened
before
the
first
of
august
the
more
one
realizes
that
no
one
at
the
head
of
affairs
quite
meant
war
at
that
stage
it
was
something
into
which
they
glided
or
rather
staggered
and
stumbled
perhaps
through
folly
and
a
discussion
i
have
no
doubt
would
have
averted
it
well
it
would
strike
an
unprejudiced
person
that
if
this
were
true
there
is
a
great
deal
of
doubt
put
upon
lloyd
george
former
statements
by
lloyd
george
himself
persons
who
plot
carefully
skilfully
insidiously
and
clandestinely
do
not
glide
they
do
not
stagger
or
stumble
especially
through
folly
they
keep
going
as
we
in
america
were
assured
that
the
german
government
did
keep
going
right
up
to
the
day
of
their
own
choosing
moreover
they
are
not
likely
to
be
headed
off
by
discussion
highwaymen
are
notoriously
curt
in
their
speech
and
if
one
attempts
discussion
with
them
they
become
irritable
and
peremptory
this
is
the
invariable
habit
of
highwaymen
besides
if
discussion
would
have
averted
war
in
why
was
it
not
forthcoming
certainly
not
through
any
fault
of
the
austrian
government
which
made
every
concession
as
the
british
ambassador
report
shows
notwithstanding
its
grievance
against
serbia
was
a
just
one
certainly
not
through
any
fault
of
the
german
government
which
never
refused
discussion
and
held
its
hand
with
all
the
restraint
possible
under
the
circumstances
just
described
well
then
how
is
it
so
clear
that
german
responsibility
for
the
war
should
be
treated
as
a
vii
people
who
have
a
clear
and
simple
case
do
not
talk
in
this
fashion
picking
now
at
random
among
the
utterances
of
politicians
and
propagandists
we
find
an
assorted
of
aims
assigned
and
causes
alleged
and
in
all
of
them
there
is
that
curious
incomprehensible
and
callous
disregard
of
the
power
of
conviction
that
a
straight
story
always
exercises
if
you
have
one
to
tell
in
november
when
the
foreign
office
was
being
pestered
by
demands
for
a
statement
of
the
allied
lord
robert
cecil
said
in
the
house
of
commons
that
the
restitution
of
alsace
and
lorraine
to
france
was
a
from
the
moment
we
entered
the
war
as
things
have
turned
out
it
is
an
odd
coincidence
how
so
many
of
these
places
that
have
iron
or
coal
or
oil
in
them
seem
to
represent
a
less
than
a
month
before
in
october
general
smuts
said
that
to
his
mind
the
one
great
dominating
was
the
end
of
militarism
the
end
of
standing
armies
well
the
allies
won
the
war
but
judging
by
results
this
dominating
seems
rather
to
have
been
lost
sight
of
lloyd
george
again
on
another
occasion
said
in
the
house
of
commons
that
was
one
of
the
principles
for
which
we
entered
the
war
a
principle
from
which
we
have
never
departed
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
this
too
seems
an
aim
that
for
some
reason
the
victorious
nations
have
not
quite
realized
indeed
in
some
cases
as
in
ireland
for
example
there
has
been
no
great
alacrity
shown
about
trying
to
realize
it
viscount
bryce
said
that
the
war
sprang
from
the
strife
of
races
and
religions
in
the
balkan
countries
and
from
the
violence
done
to
the
sentiment
of
nationality
in
which
made
france
the
ally
of
russia
but
the
fact
is
that
france
became
the
ally
of
russia
on
the
basis
of
hard
cash
and
since
the
russian
revolution
she
has
been
a
bit
out
of
luck
by
way
of
getting
her
money
back
asquith
in
the
house
of
commons
august
said
if
i
am
asked
what
we
are
fighting
for
i
reply
in
two
sentences
in
the
first
place
to
fulfil
a
solemn
international
obligation
secondly
we
are
fighting
to
vindicate
the
principle
that
small
nationalities
are
not
to
be
crushed
in
defiance
of
international
good
faith
just
so
and
in
the
house
of
commons
december
he
said
the
league
of
nations
was
the
avowed
purpose
the
very
purpose
for
which
we
entered
the
war
and
for
which
we
are
continuing
the
war
you
pays
your
money
you
see
and
takes
your
choice
the
point
to
be
made
however
is
that
one
who
has
a
strong
case
a
real
case
never
trifles
with
it
in
this
way
would
the
reader
do
it
viii
asquith
citation
of
a
solemn
international
obligation
refers
to
the
belgian
treaties
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
case
of
belgium
was
the
great
winning
card
played
by
the
allied
governments
for
the
stakes
of
american
sympathies
and
therefore
we
may
here
properly
make
a
survey
somewhat
in
detail
of
the
status
of
belgium
at
the
outset
of
the
war
belgium
had
learned
forty
years
ago
how
she
stood
under
the
treaties
of
and
when
in
the
late
there
was
likelihood
of
a
war
the
question
of
england
participation
under
these
treaties
was
thoroughly
discussed
and
it
was
shown
conclusively
that
england
was
not
obligated
perhaps
the
best
summary
of
the
case
was
that
given
by
stead
in
the
mall
in
the
issues
of
and
february
after
an
examination
of
the
treaties
of
and
an
examination
unfortunately
too
long
to
be
quoted
here
stead
briefly
sums
up
the
result
of
his
investigation
in
the
following
statement
there
is
therefore
no
english
guarantee
to
belgium
it
is
possible
perhaps
to
such
a
guarantee
but
the
case
may
be
summed
up
as
follows
england
is
under
no
guarantee
whatever
except
such
as
is
common
to
austria
france
russia
and
germany
that
guarantee
is
not
specifically
of
the
neutrality
of
belgium
at
all
and
is
given
not
to
belgium
but
to
the
netherlands
this
was
the
official
view
of
the
british
government
at
the
time
and
it
is
reflected
in
the
celebrated
letter
signed
diplomaticus
in
the
of
february
to
which
stead
refers
which
indeed
he
makes
the
guiding
text
for
his
examination
the
was
then
the
organ
of
lord
salisbury
government
and
it
is
as
nearly
certain
as
anything
of
the
sort
can
be
that
the
letter
signed
diplomaticus
was
written
by
the
hand
of
the
british
prime
minister
lord
salisbury
himself
how
asquith
government
in
august
came
suddenly
to
extemporize
a
wholly
different
view
of
england
obligations
to
belgium
is
excellently
told
by
that
inveterate
diarist
and
chronicler
wilfred
scawen
blunt
the
obligation
of
fighting
in
alliance
with
france
in
case
of
a
war
with
germany
concerned
the
honour
of
three
members
only
of
asquith
cabinet
who
alone
were
aware
of
the
exact
promises
that
had
been
made
these
though
given
verbally
and
with
reservations
as
to
the
consent
of
parliament
bound
the
three
as
a
matter
of
personal
honour
and
were
understood
at
the
quai
as
binding
the
british
nation
neither
asquith
nor
his
two
companions
in
this
inner
cabinet
could
have
retained
office
had
they
gone
back
from
their
word
in
spirit
or
in
letter
it
would
also
doubtless
have
entailed
a
serious
quarrel
with
the
french
government
had
they
failed
to
make
it
good
so
clearly
was
the
promise
understood
at
paris
to
be
binding
that
president
poincaré
when
the
crisis
came
had
written
to
king
george
reminding
him
of
it
as
an
engagement
made
between
the
two
nations
which
he
counted
on
his
majesty
to
keep
thus
faced
the
case
was
laid
before
the
cabinet
but
was
found
to
fail
as
a
convincing
argument
for
war
it
was
then
that
asquith
with
his
lawyer
instinct
at
a
second
cabinet
meeting
brought
forward
the
neutrality
of
belgium
as
a
better
plea
than
the
other
to
lay
before
a
british
jury
and
by
representing
the
of
and
as
entailing
an
obligation
on
england
to
fight
of
which
the
text
of
the
treaties
contains
no
word
obtained
the
cabinet
consent
and
war
was
declared
belgium
was
not
thought
of
by
the
british
cabinet
before
august
she
was
brought
in
then
as
a
means
of
making
the
war
go
down
with
the
british
people
the
fact
is
that
belgium
was
thoroughly
prepared
for
war
thoroughly
prepared
for
just
what
happened
to
her
belgium
was
a
party
to
the
military
arrangements
effected
among
france
england
and
russia
for
this
we
have
the
testimony
of
marshal
joffre
before
the
metallurgic
committee
in
paris
and
also
the
record
of
the
conversations
that
were
carried
on
in
brussels
between
the
belgian
chief
of
staff
and
barnardiston
on
july
the
day
when
the
austrian
note
was
presented
to
serbia
the
note
of
which
sir
grey
had
gotten
an
intimation
as
early
as
july
by
telegraph
from
the
british
ambassador
at
vienna
sir
de
bunsen
the
belgian
foreign
minister
davignon
promptly
dispatched
to
all
the
belgian
embassies
an
identical
communication
containing
the
following
statement
the
significance
of
which
is
made
clear
by
a
glance
at
a
map
all
necessary
steps
to
ensure
respect
of
belgian
neutrality
have
nevertheless
been
taken
by
the
government
the
belgian
army
has
been
mobilized
and
is
taking
up
such
strategic
positions
as
have
been
chosen
to
secure
the
defence
of
the
country
and
the
respect
of
its
neutrality
the
forts
of
antwerp
and
on
the
meuse
have
been
put
in
a
state
of
defence
it
was
on
the
eastern
frontier
we
perceive
therefore
not
on
the
western
where
belgium
might
have
been
invaded
by
france
that
all
the
available
belgian
military
force
was
concentrated
hence
to
pretend
any
longer
that
the
belgian
government
was
surprised
by
the
action
of
germany
or
unprepared
to
meet
it
to
picture
germany
and
belgium
as
cat
and
mouse
to
understand
the
position
of
belgium
otherwise
than
that
she
was
one
of
four
solid
allies
under
definite
agreement
worked
out
in
complete
practical
detail
is
sheer
absurdity
footnote
sir
grey
and
lord
haldane
ix
if
the
official
theory
of
german
responsibility
were
correct
it
would
be
impossible
to
explain
the
german
government
choice
of
the
year
as
a
time
to
strike
at
an
unsuspecting
and
defenceless
europe
the
figures
quoted
in
chapter
iii
show
that
the
military
strength
of
germany
relatively
to
that
of
the
combination
had
been
decreasing
since
if
germany
had
wished
to
strike
at
europe
she
had
two
chances
one
in
and
another
in
and
not
only
let
them
both
go
by
but
threw
all
her
weight
on
the
side
of
peace
this
is
inexplicable
upon
the
theory
that
animates
the
treaty
of
versailles
germany
was
then
in
a
position
of
advantage
the
occasion
presented
itself
in
in
serbia
quarrel
with
austria
over
the
annexation
of
bosnia
and
the
herzegovina
russia
which
was
backing
serbia
was
in
no
shape
to
fight
her
military
strength
used
up
in
the
war
had
not
recovered
france
would
not
at
this
time
have
been
willing
to
go
to
war
with
germany
over
her
weak
commitments
in
the
danube
states
germany
however
contented
herself
with
serving
notice
on
the
tsar
of
her
unequivocal
support
of
austria
and
this
was
enough
the
tsar
accepted
the
of
the
annexation
of
bosnia
and
the
herzegovina
serbia
retired
and
cooled
off
and
turkey
from
whom
the
annexed
province
was
ravished
was
compensated
by
austria
it
is
not
to
the
point
to
scrutinize
the
propriety
of
these
transactions
the
point
is
that
germany
held
the
peace
of
europe
in
the
hollow
of
her
hand
with
immense
advantages
in
her
favour
and
chose
not
to
close
her
hand
the
comment
of
a
neutral
diplomat
the
belgian
minister
in
berlin
is
interesting
in
his
report
of
april
to
the
belgian
foreign
office
he
says
the
conference
scheme
elaborated
by
isvolsky
and
sir
edward
grey
the
negotiations
for
collective
representations
in
vienna
and
the
whole
exchange
of
ideas
among
london
paris
and
petersburg
were
steadily
aimed
at
forcing
into
a
transaction
which
would
strongly
have
resembled
a
humiliation
this
humiliation
would
have
affected
germany
as
directly
and
as
sensibly
as
and
would
have
struck
a
heavy
blow
at
the
confidence
which
is
inspired
in
vienna
by
the
alliance
with
germany
these
machinations
were
frustrated
by
absolutely
unequivocal
and
decided
attitude
from
which
she
has
never
departed
in
spite
of
all
the
urgings
with
which
she
has
been
harassed
germany
alone
has
accomplished
the
preservation
of
peace
the
new
grouping
of
the
powers
organized
by
the
king
of
england
has
measured
its
forces
with
the
alliance
of
the
central
european
powers
and
has
shown
itself
incapable
of
impairing
the
same
hence
the
vexation
which
is
manifested
the
last
two
sentences
of
the
foregoing
seem
to
show
putting
it
mildly
that
the
belgian
minister
did
not
suspect
the
german
government
of
any
aggressive
spirit
in
the
same
dispatch
moreover
he
remarks
as
always
when
everything
does
not
go
as
the
french
english
or
russian
politicians
want
it
to
the
shows
its
bad
temper
germany
is
the
scapegoat
again
at
the
time
of
the
balkan
war
in
germany
had
an
excellent
opportunity
to
gratify
her
military
ambition
if
she
had
any
at
the
expense
of
an
unsuspecting
and
unprepared
europe
not
as
advantageous
as
in
but
more
advantageous
than
in
serbia
provocations
against
had
become
so
great
that
the
austrian
archduke
assassinated
in
at
sarajevo
told
the
german
emperor
personally
that
they
had
reached
the
limit
of
endurance
on
this
occasion
also
however
william
ii
put
himself
definitely
on
the
side
of
peace
and
in
so
doing
left
the
austrian
government
somewhat
disappointed
and
discontented
another
neutral
diplomat
reports
of
the
german
foreign
minister
that
whatever
plans
he
may
have
in
his
head
and
he
has
big
ideas
for
winning
the
sympathies
of
the
young
balkan
powers
over
to
germany
one
thing
is
absolutely
certain
and
that
is
that
he
is
rigidly
determined
to
avoid
a
european
conflagration
on
this
point
the
policy
of
germany
is
similar
to
that
of
england
and
france
both
of
which
countries
are
determinedly
pacifist
this
is
a
fair
statement
of
the
english
and
french
position
in
there
was
a
great
revulsion
of
feeling
in
england
after
her
close
shave
of
being
dragged
into
war
over
morocco
and
her
sentiment
was
all
for
attending
to
certain
pressing
domestic
problems
besides
it
was
only
in
november
and
only
through
the
indiscretion
of
a
french
newspaper
that
the
british
public
and
the
british
parliament
as
well
had
learned
that
the
agreement
of
had
secret
articles
attached
to
it
out
of
which
had
emanated
the
imbroglio
over
morocco
and
there
was
a
considerable
feeling
of
distrust
towards
the
foreign
office
in
fact
sir
grey
the
foreign
minister
was
so
unpopular
with
his
own
party
that
quite
probably
he
would
have
had
to
get
out
of
office
if
he
had
not
been
sustained
by
tory
influence
stead
expressed
a
quite
general
sentiment
in
the
of
for
december
the
fact
remains
that
in
order
to
put
france
in
possession
of
morocco
we
all
but
went
to
war
with
germany
we
have
escaped
war
but
we
have
not
escaped
the
national
and
abiding
enmity
of
the
german
people
is
it
possible
to
frame
a
heavier
indictment
of
the
foreign
policy
of
any
british
ministry
the
secret
the
open
secret
of
this
almost
incredible
crime
against
british
interests
and
the
peace
of
the
world
is
the
unfortunate
fact
that
sir
edward
grey
has
been
dominated
by
men
in
the
foreign
office
who
believe
all
considerations
must
be
subordinated
to
the
one
supreme
duty
of
thwarting
germany
at
every
turn
even
if
in
doing
so
british
interests
and
the
peace
of
the
world
are
trampled
underfoot
i
speak
that
of
which
i
know
this
was
strong
language
and
it
went
without
challenge
for
too
many
englishmen
felt
that
way
in
france
the
combination
was
getting
well
into
the
saddle
but
with
english
public
opinion
in
this
notably
undependable
condition
english
support
of
france
in
spite
of
the
secret
agreement
binding
the
two
governments
was
decidedly
risky
thereupon
france
also
was
determinedly
pacifist
now
if
germany
had
been
the
prime
mover
in
the
most
dangerous
conspiracy
ever
plotted
against
the
liberty
of
nations
why
did
she
not
take
advantage
of
that
situation
russia
too
was
determinedly
pacifist
in
and
with
good
reason
there
was
a
party
of
considerable
influence
in
the
tsar
court
that
was
strongly
for
going
to
war
in
behalf
of
serbia
but
it
was
finally
headed
off
by
the
foreign
minister
sazonov
who
knew
the
state
of
public
opinion
in
england
and
its
effect
on
france
and
knew
therefore
that
the
alliance
was
not
yet
in
shape
to
take
on
large
orders
it
is
true
that
the
in
france
had
proof
enough
in
that
it
could
count
on
the
british
government
support
and
what
france
knew
russia
knew
undoubtedly
too
the
british
government
would
somehow
under
some
pretext
or
other
possibly
belgian
neutrality
have
contrived
to
redeem
its
obligations
as
it
did
in
but
the
atmosphere
of
the
country
was
not
favourable
and
the
thing
would
have
been
difficult
accordingly
sazonov
saw
that
it
was
best
for
him
to
restrain
serbia
impetuosity
and
truculence
for
the
time
being
russia
herself
being
none
too
ready
and
accordingly
he
did
so
but
how
the
serbian
minister
at
petersburg
says
that
sazonov
told
him
that
in
view
of
serbia
successes
he
had
confidence
in
our
strength
and
believed
that
we
would
be
able
to
deliver
a
blow
at
austria
for
that
reason
we
should
feel
satisfied
with
what
we
were
to
receive
and
consider
it
merely
as
a
temporary
on
the
road
to
further
gains
on
another
occasion
sazonov
told
me
that
we
must
work
for
the
future
because
we
would
acquire
a
great
deal
of
territory
from
austria
the
serbian
minister
at
bucharest
says
that
his
russian
and
french
colleagues
counselled
a
policy
of
waiting
with
as
great
a
degree
of
preparedness
as
possible
the
important
events
which
must
make
their
appearance
among
the
great
powers
how
one
may
ask
was
the
russian
foreign
office
able
to
look
so
far
and
so
clearly
into
the
future
if
german
responsibility
for
the
war
is
fundamental
a
as
lloyd
george
said
it
is
this
seems
a
strange
way
for
the
russian
foreign
minister
to
be
talking
as
far
back
as
but
stranger
still
is
the
fact
that
the
german
government
did
not
jump
in
at
this
juncture
instead
of
postponing
its
blow
until
when
every
one
was
apparently
quite
ready
to
receive
it
when
the
historian
of
the
future
considers
the
theory
of
the
versailles
treaty
and
considers
the
behaviour
of
the
german
government
in
the
crisis
of
and
in
the
crisis
of
he
will
have
to
scratch
his
head
a
great
deal
to
make
them
harmonize
x
by
the
spring
of
the
diplomatic
representatives
of
the
allied
danube
states
made
no
secret
of
the
relations
in
which
their
governments
stood
to
the
tsar
foreign
office
the
balkan
league
was
put
through
by
russian
influence
and
russia
controlled
its
diplomacy
serbia
was
as
completely
the
instrument
of
russia
as
poland
is
now
the
instrument
of
france
if
the
austrian
troops
invade
balkan
territory
wrote
baron
beyens
on
april
it
would
give
cause
for
russia
to
intervene
and
might
let
loose
a
universal
war
now
if
germany
had
been
plotting
with
ruthless
cynical
determination
as
lloyd
george
said
against
the
peace
of
europe
what
inconceivable
stupidity
for
her
not
to
push
austria
along
rather
than
do
everything
possible
to
hold
her
back
why
give
russia
the
benefit
of
eighteen
months
of
valuable
time
for
the
feverish
campaign
of
preparedness
that
she
carried
on
those
eighteen
months
meant
a
great
deal
in
february
the
tsar
arranged
to
provide
the
serbian
army
with
rifles
and
artillery
serbia
agreeing
to
put
half
a
million
soldiers
in
the
field
in
the
same
month
russia
negotiated
a
french
loan
of
about
million
for
improvements
on
her
strategic
railways
and
during
the
spring
she
made
test
mobilizations
of
large
bodies
of
troops
which
were
never
demobilized
and
these
test
mobilizations
continued
down
to
the
outbreak
of
the
war
and
in
april
russian
agents
made
technical
arrangements
with
agents
of
the
british
and
french
admiralties
for
possible
combined
naval
action
yes
those
eighteen
months
were
very
busy
months
for
russia
true
she
came
out
at
the
end
of
them
an
unprepared
and
unsuspecting
nation
presumably
for
was
not
all
europe
unprepared
and
unsuspecting
is
it
not
so
nominated
in
the
versailles
treaty
one
can
not
help
wondering
however
how
it
is
that
germany
carefully
skilfully
insidiously
clandestinely
planning
in
every
detail
a
murderous
attack
on
the
peace
of
europe
should
have
given
russia
the
inestimable
advantage
of
those
eighteen
months
xi
morel
editor
of
the
british
monthly
performed
more
than
a
distinguished
service
it
is
a
splendid
an
illustrious
service
to
the
disparaged
cause
of
justice
when
recently
he
translated
and
published
in
england
through
the
national
labour
press
a
series
of
remarkable
state
documents
this
consists
of
reports
made
by
the
belgian
diplomatic
representatives
at
paris
london
and
berlin
to
the
belgian
minister
of
foreign
affairs
covering
the
period
from
february
to
july
their
authenticity
has
never
been
questioned
they
have
received
no
notice
in
this
country
their
content
and
import
were
carefully
kept
from
the
american
people
as
long
as
it
was
possible
to
do
so
and
consequently
they
remain
unknown
except
to
a
few
who
are
students
of
international
affairs
or
who
have
some
similar
special
interest
it
can
hardly
be
pretended
by
anyone
that
belgian
officials
had
during
that
decade
any
particular
love
or
leaning
towards
germany
the
belgian
foreign
office
has
always
been
as
free
from
sentimental
attachments
as
any
other
it
has
always
been
governed
by
the
same
motives
that
govern
the
british
french
german
and
russian
foreign
offices
its
number
like
theirs
was
number
one
it
was
out
first
and
last
for
the
interests
of
the
belgian
government
and
it
scrutinized
every
international
transaction
from
the
viewpoint
of
those
interests
and
those
only
it
was
fully
aware
of
the
position
of
belgium
as
a
mere
strategic
corridor
and
for
alien
armies
in
case
of
a
general
european
war
and
aware
that
belgium
had
simply
to
make
the
best
of
its
bad
outlook
for
nothing
else
could
be
done
if
the
belgian
foreign
office
and
its
agents
moreover
had
no
special
love
for
germany
neither
had
they
any
special
fear
of
her
they
were
in
no
more
or
deeper
dread
of
a
german
invasion
than
of
a
british
or
french
invasion
in
fact
in
the
belgian
minister
at
berlin
set
forth
in
a
most
way
his
belief
that
in
the
event
of
war
belgian
neutrality
would
be
first
violated
by
great
britain
these
observers
in
short
may
on
all
accounts
as
far
as
one
can
see
be
accepted
as
neutral
and
disinterested
with
the
peculiar
disinterestedness
of
one
who
has
no
choice
between
two
evils
well
then
under
the
circumstances
it
is
remarkable
that
if
germany
during
the
ten
years
preceding
august
were
plotting
against
the
peace
of
the
world
these
belgian
observers
seem
unaware
of
it
it
is
equally
noteworthy
that
if
germany
assault
were
unprovoked
they
seem
unaware
of
that
also
these
documents
relate
in
an
extremely
way
a
continuous
series
of
extraordinary
provocations
put
upon
the
german
government
and
moreover
they
represent
the
behaviour
of
the
german
government
under
these
provocations
in
a
very
favourable
light
on
the
other
hand
they
show
from
beginning
to
end
a
most
profound
distrust
of
english
diplomacy
if
there
is
any
uncertainty
about
the
causes
of
between
england
and
germany
these
belgian
officials
certainly
do
not
share
it
they
regularly
speak
of
england
jealousy
of
germany
economic
competition
and
the
provocative
attitude
to
which
this
jealousy
gave
rise
they
speak
of
it
moreover
as
though
it
were
something
that
the
belgian
government
were
already
well
aware
of
they
speak
of
it
in
the
tone
of
pure
commonplace
such
as
one
might
use
in
an
incidental
reference
to
the
weather
or
to
a
or
to
any
other
matter
that
is
well
understood
and
about
which
there
is
no
difference
of
opinion
and
nothing
new
to
be
said
this
is
all
the
more
remarkable
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it
was
nominally
to
save
belgium
and
to
defend
the
sanctity
of
belgian
neutrality
that
england
entered
the
war
in
august
these
belgian
agents
are
invariably
suspicious
of
english
diplomacy
as
morel
points
out
mainly
because
they
feel
that
it
is
tending
to
make
the
war
which
they
dread
for
their
country
they
persistently
and
unanimously
insinuate
that
if
left
to
themselves
france
and
germany
would
reach
a
settlement
of
their
differences
and
that
british
diplomacy
was
being
continually
exercised
to
envenom
the
controversy
and
to
draw
a
circle
of
hostile
alliances
round
germany
this
indeed
under
a
specious
concern
for
the
balance
of
power
has
been
the
historic
rôle
of
english
diplomacy
every
one
remembers
how
in
just
before
the
war
matthew
arnold
imaginary
prussian
arminius
von
wrote
to
the
editor
of
the
mall
begging
him
to
prevail
upon
his
for
heaven
sake
not
to
go
on
biting
first
the
french
emperor
tail
and
then
ours
on
february
the
belgian
minister
in
berlin
reported
thus
the
real
cause
of
the
english
hatred
of
germany
is
the
jealousy
aroused
by
the
astonishing
development
of
germany
merchant
navy
and
of
her
commerce
and
manufactures
this
hatred
will
last
until
the
english
have
thoroughly
learned
to
understand
that
the
trade
is
not
by
rights
an
exclusively
english
monopoly
moreover
it
is
studiously
fostered
by
the
and
a
whole
string
of
other
daily
papers
and
periodicals
that
do
not
stop
short
of
calumny
in
order
to
pander
to
the
tastes
of
their
readers
at
that
time
the
centre
of
the
english
navy
had
just
been
shifted
to
the
north
sea
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
very
disturbing
and
as
at
first
reported
a
very
flamboyant
speech
from
the
civil
lord
of
the
admiralty
lee
of
the
sensation
thereby
created
in
germany
the
belgian
minister
says
in
informing
the
british
public
that
germany
does
not
dream
of
any
aggression
against
england
count
bülow
the
german
chancellor
said
no
more
than
what
is
recognized
by
every
one
who
considers
the
matter
dispassionately
germany
would
have
nothing
to
gain
from
a
contest
the
german
fleet
has
been
created
with
a
purely
defensive
object
the
small
capacity
of
the
in
her
high
seas
fleet
and
the
small
number
of
her
cruisers
prove
besides
that
her
fleet
is
not
intended
for
use
at
any
distance
from
the
coast
on
the
other
hand
he
remarks
in
the
same
report
it
was
obvious
that
the
new
disposition
of
the
english
navy
was
aimed
at
germany
it
certainly
is
not
because
of
russia
whose
material
stock
is
to
a
great
extent
destroyed
and
whose
navy
has
just
given
striking
proof
of
incompetence
in
the
war
such
is
the
tone
uniformly
adopted
by
these
neutral
observers
throughout
their
reports
from
to
on
october
the
belgian
minister
in
paris
wrote
england
in
her
efforts
to
maintain
her
supremacy
and
to
hinder
the
development
of
her
great
german
rival
is
evidently
inspired
by
the
wish
to
avoid
a
conflict
but
are
not
her
selfish
aims
in
themselves
bringing
it
upon
us
she
thought
when
she
concluded
the
japanese
alliance
and
gradually
drew
france
into
similar
ties
that
she
had
found
the
means
to
her
end
by
sufficiently
paralysing
germany
powers
as
to
make
war
impossible
this
view
of
the
alliance
is
interesting
and
significant
especially
now
when
that
instrument
is
coming
up
for
renewal
with
the
united
states
standing
towards
england
in
the
same
relation
of
economic
competitorship
that
germany
occupied
in
true
viscount
bryce
assured
the
institute
of
politics
at
williams
college
last
summer
that
it
was
not
germany
economic
rivalry
that
disturbed
england
but
on
this
point
it
would
be
highly
advantageous
for
the
people
of
the
united
states
while
there
is
yet
time
to
read
what
the
belgian
minister
in
berlin
had
to
say
on
october
a
very
large
number
of
germans
are
convinced
that
england
is
either
seeking
allies
for
an
attack
upon
germany
or
else
which
would
be
more
in
accordance
with
british
tradition
that
she
is
labouring
to
provoke
a
continental
war
in
which
she
would
not
join
but
of
which
she
would
reap
the
profit
i
am
told
that
many
english
people
are
troubled
with
similar
fears
and
go
in
dread
of
german
aggression
i
am
puzzled
upon
what
foundations
such
an
impression
in
london
can
be
based
germany
is
absolutely
incapable
of
attacking
england
are
these
people
in
england
really
sincere
who
go
about
expressing
fears
of
a
german
invasion
which
could
not
materialize
are
they
not
rather
pretending
to
be
afraid
of
it
in
order
to
bring
on
a
war
which
would
annihilate
germany
navy
her
and
her
foreign
commerce
germany
is
as
vulnerable
to
attack
as
england
is
safe
from
it
and
if
england
were
to
attack
germany
merely
for
the
sake
of
extinguishing
a
rival
it
would
only
be
in
accordance
with
her
old
precedents
in
turn
she
wiped
out
the
dutch
fleet
with
the
assistance
of
louis
xiv
then
the
french
fleet
and
the
danish
fleet
she
even
destroyed
in
time
of
peace
and
without
any
provocation
simply
because
it
constituted
a
naval
force
of
some
magnitude
there
are
no
ostensible
grounds
for
war
between
germany
and
england
the
english
hatred
for
germany
arises
solely
from
jealousy
of
germany
progress
in
shipping
in
commerce
and
in
manufacture
baron
greindl
here
presents
an
opinion
very
different
from
that
in
which
the
majority
of
americans
have
been
instructed
and
before
they
accept
further
instruction
at
the
hands
of
viscount
bryce
they
had
better
look
into
the
matter
somewhat
for
themselves
baron
greindl
wrote
the
foregoing
in
october
in
december
the
head
of
the
british
admiralty
sir
john
fisher
assured
colonel
repington
that
admiral
wilson
channel
fleet
was
alone
strong
enough
to
smash
the
whole
german
fleet
later
sir
john
fisher
wrote
to
king
edward
vii
that
it
is
an
absolute
fact
that
germany
has
not
laid
down
a
single
dreadnaught
nor
has
she
commenced
building
a
single
battleship
or
big
cruiser
for
eighteen
months
england
has
ten
dreadnaughts
built
and
building
while
germany
in
march
last
had
not
even
begun
one
dreadnaught
we
have
destroyers
and
forty
submarines
the
germans
have
destroyers
and
one
submarine
hence
if
sir
john
fisher
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
and
in
such
matters
he
usually
did
he
furnishes
a
very
considerable
corroboration
of
baron
view
of
the
german
navy
up
to
looking
back
at
the
third
chapter
of
this
book
which
deals
with
the
comparative
strength
of
the
two
navies
and
naval
groups
as
developed
from
to
the
reader
may
well
raise
again
baron
greindl
question
are
those
people
in
england
really
sincere
footnotes
under
the
title
diplomacy
revealed
national
labour
press
and
johnson
court
london
england
this
belief
received
some
corroboration
in
the
spring
of
when
in
the
course
of
military
conversations
the
british
military
attaché
bridges
told
the
belgian
minister
of
war
that
if
war
had
broken
out
over
the
agadir
incident
in
the
british
government
would
have
landed
troops
in
belgium
with
or
without
the
belgian
government
consent
so
much
did
the
british
government
think
of
the
scrap
of
paper
xii
such
is
the
inveterate
suspicion
the
melancholy
distrust
put
upon
english
diplomacy
by
these
foreign
and
neutral
observers
who
could
see
so
plainly
what
would
befall
their
own
country
in
the
event
of
a
european
war
such
too
was
the
responsibility
which
these
observers
regularly
imputed
to
the
british
foreign
office
the
british
foreign
office
which
was
so
soon
to
fix
upon
the
neutrality
of
belgium
as
a
and
pour
out
streams
of
propaganda
about
the
sanctity
of
treaties
and
the
rights
of
small
nations
every
one
of
these
observers
exhibits
this
suspicion
and
distrust
in
march
when
edward
vii
visited
paris
and
invited
the
discredited
delcassé
to
breakfast
the
belgian
minister
at
paris
wrote
it
looks
as
though
the
king
wished
to
demonstrate
that
the
policy
which
called
forth
germany
active
intervention
over
morocco
has
nevertheless
remained
unchanged
in
french
circles
it
is
not
over
well
received
frenchmen
feeling
that
they
are
being
dragged
against
their
will
in
the
orbit
of
english
policy
a
policy
whose
consequences
they
dread
and
which
they
generally
condemned
by
throwing
over
delcassé
in
short
people
fear
that
this
is
a
sign
that
england
wants
so
to
envenom
the
situation
that
war
will
become
inevitable
on
february
when
the
english
king
and
queen
visited
paris
he
says
one
can
not
conceal
from
oneself
that
these
tactics
though
their
ostensible
object
is
to
prevent
war
are
likely
to
arouse
great
dissatisfaction
in
berlin
and
to
stir
up
a
desire
to
risk
anything
that
may
enable
germany
to
burst
the
ring
which
england
policy
is
tightening
around
her
on
march
the
belgian
in
london
speaks
of
english
diplomacy
whose
whole
effort
is
directed
to
the
isolation
of
germany
on
the
same
date
by
a
curious
coincidence
the
minister
at
berlin
in
the
course
of
a
blistering
arraignment
of
french
policy
in
morocco
says
but
at
the
bottom
of
every
settlement
that
has
been
made
or
is
going
to
be
made
there
lurks
always
that
hatred
of
germany
it
is
a
sequence
of
the
campaign
very
cleverly
conducted
with
the
object
of
isolating
germany
the
english
press
is
carrying
on
its
campaign
of
calumny
more
implacably
than
ever
it
sees
the
finger
of
germany
in
everything
that
goes
contrary
to
english
wishes
on
april
baron
greindl
says
of
the
king
of
england
visit
to
the
king
of
spain
that
like
the
alliances
with
japan
and
france
and
the
negotiations
with
russia
it
is
one
of
the
moves
in
the
campaign
to
isolate
germany
that
is
being
personally
directed
with
as
much
perseverance
as
success
by
his
majesty
king
edward
vii
in
the
same
dispatch
he
remarks
there
is
some
right
to
regard
with
suspicion
this
eagerness
to
unite
for
a
defensive
object
powers
who
are
menaced
by
nobody
at
berlin
they
can
not
forget
that
offer
of
men
made
by
the
king
of
england
to
m
delcassé
on
may
the
minister
at
london
reported
that
it
is
plain
that
official
england
is
pursuing
a
policy
that
is
covertly
hostile
and
tending
to
result
in
the
isolation
of
germany
and
that
king
edward
has
not
been
above
putting
his
personal
influence
at
the
service
of
this
cause
on
june
count
de
lalaing
again
writes
from
london
of
the
agreement
concerning
the
in
the
mediterranean
region
that
it
is
however
difficult
to
imagine
that
germany
will
not
regard
it
as
a
further
step
in
england
policy
which
is
determined
by
every
sort
of
means
to
isolate
the
german
empire
perusal
of
these
documents
from
beginning
to
end
will
show
nothing
to
offset
against
the
view
of
english
diplomacy
exhibited
in
the
foregoing
quotations
nothing
to
modify
or
qualify
that
view
in
any
way
baron
greindl
however
speaks
highly
of
the
british
ambassador
at
berlin
sir
lascelles
and
praises
his
personal
and
unsupported
attempt
to
establish
friendly
relations
between
england
and
germany
of
this
he
says
i
have
been
a
witness
for
the
last
twelve
years
of
the
efforts
he
has
made
to
accomplish
it
and
yet
possessing
as
he
justly
does
the
absolute
confidence
of
the
emperor
and
the
german
government
and
eminently
gifted
with
the
qualities
of
a
statesman
he
has
nevertheless
not
succeeded
very
well
so
far
the
next
year
when
sir
lascelles
was
forced
to
resign
his
post
baron
greindl
does
not
hesitate
to
say
that
the
zeal
with
which
he
has
worked
to
dispel
misunderstandings
that
he
thought
absurd
and
highly
mischievous
for
both
countries
does
not
fall
in
with
the
political
views
of
his
sovereign
xiii
king
edward
vii
died
may
during
the
early
part
of
the
belgian
ministers
in
london
paris
and
berlin
report
some
indications
of
a
less
unfriendly
policy
towards
germany
on
the
part
of
the
british
government
in
march
of
that
year
sir
edward
grey
delivered
a
reassuring
speech
on
british
foreign
policy
on
the
occasion
of
the
debate
on
the
naval
budget
the
belgian
minister
in
berlin
says
of
this
that
it
should
have
produced
the
most
agreeable
impression
in
germany
if
one
could
confidently
believe
that
it
really
entirely
reflected
the
ideas
of
the
british
government
it
would
imply
he
says
that
england
no
longer
wishes
to
give
to
the
triple
entente
the
aggressive
character
which
was
stamped
upon
it
by
its
creator
king
edward
vii
he
remarks
however
the
slight
effect
produced
in
berlin
by
sir
grey
speech
and
infers
that
german
public
feeling
may
have
become
dulled
by
the
innumerable
meetings
and
mutual
demonstrations
of
courtesy
which
have
never
produced
any
positive
result
and
he
adds
significantly
that
this
distrust
is
comprehensible
it
must
be
remembered
that
at
the
time
this
speech
was
delivered
england
was
under
a
secret
agreement
dating
from
to
secure
economic
monopoly
in
morocco
england
was
also
under
a
secret
obligation
to
france
dating
from
to
support
her
in
case
of
war
with
germany
it
must
be
above
all
remembered
that
this
latter
obligation
carried
with
it
a
contingent
liability
for
the
military
alliance
that
had
been
in
effect
for
many
years
thus
if
russia
went
to
war
with
germany
france
was
committed
and
in
turn
england
was
committed
the
whole
force
of
the
triple
entente
lay
in
these
agreements
and
it
can
not
be
too
often
pointed
out
that
they
were
agreements
no
one
in
england
knew
until
november
that
in
the
british
government
had
bargained
with
the
french
government
in
return
for
a
free
hand
in
egypt
to
permit
france
to
squeeze
german
economic
interests
out
of
morocco
in
violation
of
a
published
agreement
signed
by
all
the
interested
nations
concerning
the
status
of
morocco
no
one
in
england
knew
until
august
that
england
had
for
several
years
been
under
a
military
and
naval
agreement
with
france
which
carried
the
enormous
contingent
liability
of
the
military
alliance
no
matter
what
appeared
on
the
surface
of
politics
no
matter
how
many
pacific
speeches
were
made
by
sir
grey
and
asquith
no
matter
what
the
newspapers
said
no
matter
how
often
and
how
impressively
lord
haldane
might
visit
berlin
in
behalf
of
peace
and
good
feeling
secret
agreements
they
were
the
only
things
that
did
hold
and
everything
worked
out
in
strict
accordance
with
them
and
with
nothing
else
least
of
all
with
any
public
understanding
or
any
statement
of
policy
put
out
for
public
consumption
it
was
just
as
in
the
subsequent
case
of
the
armistice
and
the
peace
and
this
is
something
that
has
been
far
too
little
noticed
in
this
country
the
real
terms
of
the
armistice
and
of
the
peace
were
not
the
terms
of
the
fourteen
points
or
of
any
of
the
multitudinous
published
statements
of
allied
war
aims
on
the
contrary
they
were
the
precise
terms
of
the
secret
treaties
made
among
the
allied
belligerents
during
the
war
and
made
public
on
their
discovery
by
the
soviet
government
in
the
archives
of
the
tsarist
foreign
office
it
is
no
wonder
then
that
the
german
government
was
not
particularly
impressed
by
sir
grey
speech
especially
as
germany
saw
france
helping
herself
to
moroccan
territory
with
both
hands
and
england
looking
on
in
indifferent
complacency
in
may
on
a
most
transparent
and
preposterous
pretext
a
french
army
was
ordered
to
march
on
fez
the
capital
of
morocco
the
german
government
then
informed
france
that
as
the
algeciras
act
which
guaranteed
the
integrity
and
independence
of
morocco
had
thereby
gone
by
the
board
germany
would
no
longer
consider
herself
bound
by
its
provisions
in
june
french
troops
relieved
fez
occupied
it
and
stayed
there
evincing
no
intention
whatever
of
getting
out
again
notwithstanding
that
the
ostensible
purpose
of
the
expedition
was
accomplished
in
reality
there
was
nothing
to
accomplish
two
months
before
this
baron
greindl
the
belgian
minister
at
berlin
wrote
to
the
belgian
foreign
office
as
follows
every
illusion
if
ever
entertained
on
the
value
of
the
algeciras
act
which
france
signed
with
the
firm
intention
of
never
observing
must
long
since
have
vanished
she
has
not
ceased
for
one
moment
to
pursue
her
plans
of
annexation
either
by
seizing
opportunities
for
provisional
occupations
destined
to
last
for
ever
or
by
extorting
concessions
which
have
placed
the
sultan
in
a
position
of
dependence
upon
france
and
which
have
gradually
lowered
him
to
the
level
of
the
bey
of
tunis
a
week
later
april
baron
guillaume
who
had
succeeded
leghait
as
belgian
minister
in
paris
reported
that
there
are
so
far
no
grounds
for
fearing
that
the
french
expedition
will
bring
about
any
disturbance
of
international
policy
germany
is
a
calm
spectator
of
events
he
adds
significantly
england
having
thrust
france
into
the
moroccan
bog
is
contemplating
her
work
with
satisfaction
france
professed
publicly
that
the
object
of
this
expedition
was
to
extricate
certain
foreigners
who
were
imperilled
at
fez
and
having
done
so
she
would
withdraw
her
forces
the
precious
crew
of
concessionaires
profiteers
and
known
as
the
du
had
suddenly
discovered
a
whole
french
colony
living
in
fez
in
a
state
of
terror
and
distress
there
was
in
fact
nothing
of
the
sort
fez
was
never
menaced
it
was
never
short
of
provisions
and
there
were
no
foreigners
in
trouble
when
the
expeditionary
force
arrived
it
found
no
one
to
shoot
at
as
francis
de
pressensé
says
those
redoubtable
rebels
who
were
threatening
fez
had
disappeared
like
dew
in
the
morning
barely
did
a
few
ragged
horsemen
fire
off
a
shot
or
two
before
turning
around
and
riding
away
at
a
furious
gallop
a
too
disingenuous
or
too
truthful
correspondent
gave
the
show
away
the
expeditionary
force
complains
he
gravely
records
of
the
absence
of
the
enemy
the
approaching
harvest
season
is
keeping
all
the
healthy
males
in
the
fields
thus
did
the
phantom
so
dexterously
conjured
by
the
du
for
the
benefit
of
its
aims
disappear
in
a
night
nevertheless
the
expeditionary
force
did
not
in
accordance
with
the
public
professions
of
the
french
government
march
out
of
fez
as
soon
as
it
discovered
this
ridiculous
mare
nest
it
remained
there
and
held
possession
of
the
moorish
capital
what
was
the
attitude
of
the
british
government
in
the
premises
on
may
in
the
house
of
commons
sir
edward
grey
said
that
the
action
taken
by
france
is
not
intended
to
alter
the
political
status
of
morocco
and
his
majesty
government
can
not
see
why
any
objection
should
be
taken
to
it
germany
had
remained
for
eight
years
a
tolerant
observer
of
french
encroachments
in
morocco
and
quite
clearly
as
baron
greindl
observes
in
his
report
of
april
could
not
after
eight
years
of
tolerance
change
her
attitude
unless
she
were
determined
to
go
to
war
and
war
is
immeasurably
more
than
morocco
is
worth
in
july
however
while
the
french
force
of
was
still
occupying
fez
germany
dispatched
a
gunboat
the
panther
which
anchored
off
the
coast
of
agadir
xiv
this
was
the
famous
agadir
incident
of
which
we
have
all
heard
did
it
mean
that
the
worm
had
turned
that
germany
had
changed
her
attitude
and
was
determined
to
go
to
war
it
has
been
so
represented
but
there
are
many
difficult
inconsistencies
involved
in
that
explanation
of
the
german
government
act
and
there
is
also
an
alternative
explanation
which
fits
the
facts
far
better
in
the
first
place
the
panther
was
hardly
more
than
an
tug
she
was
of
tons
burden
mounting
two
small
naval
guns
six
and
she
carried
a
complement
of
only
men
second
she
never
landed
a
man
upon
the
coast
of
morocco
she
chose
for
her
anchorage
a
point
where
the
coast
is
practically
inaccessible
agadir
has
no
harbour
and
there
is
nothing
near
it
that
offers
any
possible
temptation
to
the
predatory
instinct
no
more
ostentatiously
unimpressive
and
unmenacing
demonstration
could
have
been
devised
germany
too
was
quite
well
aware
that
morocco
was
not
worth
a
european
war
and
as
baron
guillaume
said
in
his
report
of
april
possibly
she
germany
is
congratulating
herself
on
the
difficulties
that
weigh
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
french
government
and
asks
nothing
better
than
to
keep
out
of
the
whole
affair
as
long
as
she
is
not
forced
into
it
by
economic
considerations
but
the
most
significant
indication
that
germany
had
not
changed
her
attitude
is
in
the
fact
that
if
she
were
determined
upon
war
then
rather
than
two
years
later
was
her
time
to
go
about
it
this
aspect
of
behaviour
has
been
dealt
with
in
a
previous
chapter
it
can
not
be
too
often
reiterated
that
if
germany
really
wanted
war
and
was
determined
upon
war
her
failure
to
strike
in
when
russia
was
prostrate
and
france
unready
and
again
in
a
few
months
after
the
agadir
incident
when
the
balkan
war
was
on
is
inexplicable
the
dispatch
of
the
panther
gave
the
three
belgian
observers
a
great
surprise
and
they
were
much
puzzled
to
account
for
it
baron
guillaume
thoughts
at
once
turned
to
england
he
writes
july
it
was
long
regarded
as
an
axiom
that
england
would
never
allow
the
germans
to
establish
themselves
at
any
point
of
moroccan
territory
has
this
policy
been
abandoned
and
if
so
at
what
price
were
they
bought
off
during
the
month
of
july
while
waiting
for
a
statement
from
the
british
foreign
office
the
belgian
observers
canvassed
the
possibility
that
germany
action
was
a
hint
that
she
would
like
some
territorial
compensation
for
having
been
bilked
out
of
her
share
in
the
moroccan
market
but
the
interesting
fact
and
for
the
purpose
of
this
book
the
important
fact
is
that
none
of
these
diplomats
shows
the
slightest
suspicion
that
germany
was
bent
on
war
or
that
she
had
any
thought
of
going
to
war
baron
guillaume
says
july
undoubtedly
the
present
situation
wears
a
serious
aspect
nobody
however
wants
war
and
they
will
try
to
avoid
it
he
proceeds
the
french
government
knows
that
a
war
would
be
the
of
the
republic
i
have
very
great
confidence
in
the
emperor
william
love
of
peace
notwithstanding
the
not
infrequent
air
of
melodrama
about
what
he
says
and
does
germany
can
not
go
to
war
for
the
sake
of
morocco
nor
yet
to
exact
payment
of
those
compensations
that
she
very
reasonably
demands
for
the
french
occupation
of
fez
which
has
become
more
or
less
permanent
on
the
whole
i
feel
less
faith
in
great
britain
desire
for
peace
she
would
not
be
sorry
to
see
the
others
destroying
one
another
only
under
those
circumstances
it
would
be
difficult
for
her
to
avoid
armed
intervention
as
i
thought
from
the
very
first
the
crux
of
the
situation
is
in
london
by
the
end
of
july
a
different
conception
of
germany
action
seemed
to
prevail
it
began
to
be
seen
that
the
episode
of
the
panther
had
been
staged
by
way
of
calling
for
a
on
the
actual
intentions
and
purposes
of
the
triple
entente
and
it
got
one
lloyd
george
the
impulsive
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
as
count
de
lalaing
calls
him
made
a
typical
jingo
speech
at
the
mansion
house
a
speech
which
the
prime
minister
asquith
and
sir
edward
grey
the
foreign
minister
had
helped
him
to
compose
the
air
was
cleared
at
once
england
stood
by
france
and
what
better
plan
could
have
been
devised
for
clearing
the
air
than
the
dispatch
of
the
panther
germany
stood
for
the
policy
of
economic
equality
the
policy
of
the
open
door
to
which
all
the
powers
interested
had
agreed
in
the
case
of
morocco
france
at
the
end
of
a
course
of
continuous
aggression
had
put
troops
in
occupation
of
the
capital
of
morocco
on
an
infamously
unscrupulous
pretext
and
put
them
there
to
stay
and
the
british
government
could
not
see
why
any
objection
should
be
taken
to
it
germany
on
the
other
hand
anchored
an
insignificant
gunboat
off
an
inaccessible
coast
and
without
landing
a
man
or
firing
a
shot
left
her
there
as
a
silent
reminder
of
the
algeciras
act
and
the
principle
of
the
open
door
carefully
and
even
ostentatiously
going
no
further
and
the
british
government
promptly
through
the
mouth
of
lloyd
george
laid
down
a
challenge
and
a
threat
thereupon
germany
and
france
understood
their
relative
positions
they
understood
even
without
sir
grey
explicit
reaffirmation
of
november
of
the
policy
of
the
triple
entente
that
england
would
stand
by
her
arrangements
with
france
baron
greindl
writes
from
berlin
december
and
puts
the
case
explicitly
was
it
not
assuming
the
right
of
veto
on
german
enterprise
for
england
to
start
a
hue
and
cry
because
a
german
cruiser
cast
anchor
in
the
roads
of
agadir
seeing
that
she
had
looked
on
without
a
murmur
whilst
france
and
spain
had
proceeded
step
by
step
to
conquer
morocco
and
to
destroy
the
independence
of
its
sultan
england
could
not
have
acted
otherwise
she
was
tied
by
her
secret
treaty
with
france
the
explanation
was
extremely
simple
but
it
was
not
of
a
sort
to
allay
german
irritation
footnote
critics
of
german
foreign
policy
are
hard
put
to
it
to
show
that
she
was
ever
guided
by
territorial
ambitions
which
is
an
extremely
troublesome
thing
when
one
wants
to
believe
that
she
proposed
in
to
put
the
world
under
a
military
despotism
can
any
one
show
where
in
a
single
instance
she
ever
demanded
anything
more
than
economic
equality
with
other
nations
in
a
foreign
market
certainly
she
never
demanded
more
than
this
in
morocco
caillaux
says
that
his
predecessor
rouvier
offered
germany
a
good
moroccan
port
mogador
and
some
adjoining
territory
and
germany
declined
xv
let
us
glance
at
british
political
chronology
for
a
moment
king
edward
vii
the
chief
factor
in
the
entente
the
moving
spirit
in
foreign
alliances
had
been
dead
a
year
in
december
the
liberal
party
had
come
into
power
in
april
asquith
became
prime
minister
in
relations
were
apparently
improving
in
july
asquith
spoke
of
them
in
the
house
of
commons
as
of
the
most
cordial
character
i
look
forward
to
increasing
warmth
and
fervour
and
intimacy
in
these
relations
year
by
year
the
great
question
was
then
in
whether
the
liberal
government
would
actually
when
it
came
down
to
the
pinch
stick
by
its
secret
covenant
with
france
were
the
new
liberals
were
asquith
lord
haldane
sir
grey
lloyd
george
liberal
imperialists
or
were
they
not
could
france
and
russia
safely
trust
them
to
continue
the
foreign
office
policy
that
lord
lansdowne
had
bequeathed
to
sir
grey
or
when
the
emergency
came
would
they
stand
from
under
after
all
there
been
a
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
and
one
at
least
of
the
new
liberals
lloyd
george
had
a
bad
record
in
the
south
african
war
the
agadir
incident
elicited
a
satisfactory
answer
to
these
questions
the
liberal
government
was
dependable
however
suspiciously
the
members
of
the
liberal
cabinet
might
talk
they
were
good
staunch
imperialists
at
heart
they
were
as
the
theologians
say
sound
on
the
essentials
baron
greindl
wrote
december
the
entente
cordiale
was
founded
not
on
the
positive
basis
of
defence
of
common
interests
but
on
the
negative
one
of
hatred
of
the
german
empire
sir
edward
grey
adopts
this
tradition
without
reservation
he
imagines
that
it
is
in
conformity
with
english
interests
a
revision
of
great
britain
policy
is
all
the
less
to
be
looked
for
as
ever
since
the
liberal
ministry
took
office
and
more
especially
during
the
last
few
months
english
foreign
policy
has
been
guided
by
the
ideas
with
which
king
edward
vii
inspired
it
xvi
lloyd
george
speech
at
the
mansion
house
in
july
after
the
german
gunboat
panther
had
anchored
off
the
moroccan
coast
gave
an
immense
impulse
to
the
jingo
spirit
in
france
because
it
was
taken
as
definite
assurance
of
england
good
faith
in
seeing
her
secret
agreements
through
to
a
finish
caillaux
the
french
premier
appears
to
have
had
his
doubts
nevertheless
inasmuch
as
the
british
foreign
office
did
not
give
a
straight
reply
to
the
french
foreign
inquiry
concerning
british
action
in
case
the
germans
landed
a
force
in
morocco
he
says
are
we
to
understand
that
our
powerful
neighbours
will
go
right
through
to
the
end
with
the
resolve
which
they
suggest
are
they
ready
for
all
eventualities
the
british
ambassador
sir
francis
bertie
with
whom
i
converse
does
not
give
me
formal
assurances
it
is
said
of
course
that
he
would
see
without
displeasure
the
outbreak
of
a
conflict
between
france
and
germany
his
mind
works
in
the
way
attributed
to
a
number
of
leading
british
officials
at
the
foreign
office
caillaux
here
suggests
the
same
suspicion
of
british
intentions
which
the
belgian
diplomats
at
london
paris
and
berlin
intimate
continually
throughout
their
correspondence
since
he
accordingly
favoured
a
less
energetic
policy
towards
germany
and
was
thrown
out
of
office
count
de
lalaing
reported
from
london
january
that
the
revelations
which
provoked
this
political
crisis
were
disagreeable
for
the
english
government
they
seem
to
prove
he
says
that
the
french
premier
had
been
trying
to
negotiate
with
berlin
without
the
knowledge
of
the
minister
for
foreign
affairs
and
his
other
colleagues
and
this
is
naturally
disquieting
to
a
government
whose
interests
are
bound
up
with
those
of
france
and
which
accordingly
can
ill
tolerate
any
lapses
of
this
kind
he
adds
these
revelations
have
also
strengthened
the
impression
that
caillaux
had
recently
favoured
an
policy
towards
germany
and
this
impression
was
felt
all
the
more
painfully
in
english
official
circles
as
the
full
extent
of
the
tension
between
london
and
berlin
caused
by
the
cabinet
of
james
loyal
behaviour
towards
the
cabinet
at
paris
had
hardly
been
grasped
people
in
england
are
reluctant
to
face
the
fact
that
they
have
been
royalist
than
the
king
and
have
shown
themselves
even
less
accommodating
than
the
friend
they
were
backing
accordingly
the
press
unanimously
hails
with
delight
the
departure
of
caillaux
and
trusts
that
sounder
traditions
may
be
reverted
to
without
delay
this
comment
on
the
position
of
caillaux
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
observations
to
be
found
in
these
documents
footnote
this
is
worth
noticing
since
caillaux
was
the
pioneer
victim
of
the
charge
of
being
xvii
the
balkan
war
took
place
in
and
the
whole
history
of
the
year
shows
the
most
mighty
efforts
of
european
politicians
efforts
which
seem
ludicrous
and
laughable
in
spite
of
their
tragic
quality
to
avert
with
their
left
hand
the
war
which
they
were
bringing
on
with
their
right
lloyd
george
is
right
in
saying
that
no
one
really
wanted
war
what
every
one
wanted
and
what
every
one
was
trying
with
might
and
main
to
do
was
to
cook
the
omelette
of
economic
imperialism
without
breaking
any
eggs
there
was
in
all
the
countries
naturally
a
jingo
nationalist
party
which
wanted
war
in
russia
which
was
then
busily
reorganizing
her
military
forces
which
had
been
used
up
and
left
prostrate
by
the
war
with
the
japanese
the
were
influential
and
vociferous
but
they
were
not
on
top
in
england
there
was
a
great
popular
revulsion
against
the
behaviour
of
the
government
which
had
so
nearly
involved
the
english
in
a
war
against
germany
the
year
before
and
asquith
government
which
was
pacifist
in
tendency
was
meeting
the
popular
sentiment
in
every
way
possible
of
the
one
point
of
revealing
the
secret
engagements
which
bound
it
to
the
french
government
and
contingently
to
the
russian
lord
haldane
undertook
an
official
mission
to
berlin
which
was
attended
with
great
publicity
and
was
popularly
supposed
to
be
of
a
pacificatory
nature
and
really
within
the
limits
of
the
diplomatic
agreement
it
went
as
far
as
it
could
in
the
establishment
of
good
relations
in
fact
of
course
it
came
to
nothing
as
long
as
the
diplomatic
agreement
remained
in
force
it
could
come
to
nothing
nothing
of
the
sort
could
come
to
anything
and
the
diplomatic
agreement
being
guarded
as
a
close
secret
the
reason
why
it
must
come
to
nothing
was
not
apparent
the
german
government
also
made
tremendous
efforts
in
behalf
of
peace
and
it
must
be
noted
by
those
who
accept
the
theory
upon
which
the
treaty
of
versailles
is
based
that
if
germany
had
wished
or
intended
at
any
time
to
strike
at
the
peace
of
europe
now
was
the
moment
for
her
to
do
so
instead
the
german
emperor
in
person
and
the
german
government
through
one
of
its
best
diplomatic
agents
baron
von
marschall
met
every
pacific
overture
more
than
and
themselves
initiated
all
that
could
be
thought
of
there
is
no
doubt
wrote
baron
beyens
from
berlin
that
the
emperor
the
chancellor
and
the
secretary
of
state
for
foreign
affairs
von
are
passionately
pacifists
baron
beyens
again
says
june
the
emperor
is
persistent
and
has
not
given
up
hopes
of
winning
back
english
sympathies
just
as
he
has
succeeded
up
to
a
certain
point
in
obtaining
the
confidence
of
the
tsar
by
the
force
of
his
personal
attractions
those
who
believe
in
the
extraordinary
notion
of
an
unprepared
and
unsuspecting
europe
should
read
the
diplomatic
history
of
the
year
when
all
the
chief
in
england
and
on
the
continent
were
struggling
like
men
caught
in
a
quicksand
or
like
flies
on
to
avert
or
if
they
could
not
avert
to
defer
the
inevitable
war
in
one
country
however
the
jingo
nationalist
and
militarist
party
came
on
top
and
that
country
was
france
caillaux
was
succeeded
by
raymond
poincaré
and
in
january
poincaré
became
president
of
the
republic
up
to
the
people
of
france
were
increasingly
indisposed
to
war
and
were
developing
a
considerable
impatience
with
militarism
and
the
french
government
was
responsive
to
this
sentiment
it
knew
as
baron
guillaume
remarked
at
the
time
of
the
agadir
incident
that
a
war
would
be
the
of
the
republic
caillaux
seems
to
have
measured
the
feelings
of
his
countrymen
quite
well
baron
guillaume
says
that
after
the
dispatch
of
the
panther
the
british
cabinet
first
proposal
was
that
the
british
and
french
governments
should
each
immediately
send
two
to
agadir
and
that
the
french
cabinet
strongly
objected
again
he
says
in
his
report
of
july
i
am
persuaded
that
caillaux
and
de
selves
regret
the
turn
given
to
the
moroccan
affair
by
their
predecessors
in
office
they
were
quite
ready
to
give
way
provided
they
could
do
so
without
humiliation
the
speech
of
lloyd
george
at
the
mansion
house
however
which
was
taken
by
the
french
and
how
correctly
they
took
it
became
apparent
on
august
as
a
definite
assurance
of
british
support
against
germany
gave
the
party
the
encouragement
to
go
ahead
and
dominate
the
domestic
politics
of
france
it
put
the
element
on
its
feet
and
stiffened
its
resolution
besides
clearing
the
way
in
large
measure
for
its
predominance
on
february
baron
guillaume
reports
from
paris
thus
the
new
president
of
the
republic
enjoys
a
popularity
in
france
unknown
to
any
of
his
predecessors
various
factors
contribute
to
explain
his
popularity
his
election
had
been
carefully
prepared
in
advance
people
are
pleased
at
the
skilful
way
in
which
while
a
minister
he
manoeuvred
to
bring
france
to
the
fore
in
the
concert
of
europe
he
has
hit
upon
some
happy
phrases
that
stick
in
the
popular
mind
the
career
of
poincaré
in
fact
and
his
management
of
popular
sentiment
show
many
features
which
find
a
parallel
in
the
career
of
theodore
roosevelt
baron
guillaume
adds
however
this
extremely
striking
observation
concerning
the
popularity
of
poincaré
but
above
all
one
must
regard
it
as
a
manifestation
of
the
old
french
chauvinistic
spirit
which
had
for
many
years
slumbered
but
which
had
come
to
life
again
since
the
affair
of
agadir
in
the
same
communication
to
the
belgian
foreign
office
baron
guillaume
remarks
poincaré
is
a
native
of
lorraine
and
loses
no
opportunity
of
telling
people
so
he
was
millerand
colleague
and
the
instigator
of
his
militarist
policy
finally
the
first
word
that
he
uttered
at
the
very
moment
when
he
learned
that
he
was
elected
president
of
the
republic
was
a
promise
that
he
would
watch
over
and
maintain
all
the
means
of
national
defence
poincaré
had
not
been
in
office
two
months
when
he
recalled
the
french
ambassador
at
petersburg
georges
louis
and
appointed
in
his
stead
delcassé
concerning
this
stupendous
move
baron
guillaume
reported
february
to
the
belgian
foreign
office
thus
the
news
that
delcassé
is
shortly
to
be
appointed
ambassador
at
petersburg
burst
like
a
bomb
here
yesterday
afternoon
he
was
one
of
the
architects
of
the
alliance
and
still
more
so
of
the
baron
guillaume
goes
on
to
say
that
he
does
not
think
that
appointment
should
be
interpreted
as
a
demonstration
against
germany
but
he
adds
i
do
think
however
that
poincaré
a
lorrainer
was
not
sorry
to
show
from
the
first
day
of
entering
on
his
high
office
how
anxious
he
is
to
stand
firm
and
hold
aloft
the
national
flag
that
is
the
danger
involved
in
having
poincaré
at
the
elysée
in
these
anxious
days
through
which
europe
is
passing
it
was
under
his
ministry
that
the
militarist
slightly
bellicose
instincts
of
the
french
woke
up
again
he
has
been
thought
to
have
a
measure
of
responsibility
for
this
change
of
mood
georges
louis
who
had
represented
the
french
government
at
petersburg
for
three
years
was
a
resolute
opponent
of
the
militarist
faction
in
france
and
was
therefore
distinctly
non
to
the
corresponding
faction
in
russia
at
the
head
of
this
faction
stood
isvolsky
who
was
a
friend
of
poincaré
and
a
kindred
spirit
hence
when
poincaré
became
premier
an
attempt
was
made
to
oust
louis
but
it
was
unsuccessful
delcassé
on
the
other
hand
is
described
by
morel
as
the
man
identified
more
than
any
other
man
in
french
public
life
with
the
morel
in
commenting
on
the
appointment
of
delcassé
quotes
the
following
from
a
report
sent
by
the
russian
ambassador
in
london
to
the
foreign
office
in
petersburg
it
was
written
four
days
after
the
appointment
of
delcassé
and
quite
bears
out
the
impression
made
upon
the
belgian
agents
when
i
recall
his
cambon
the
french
ambassador
in
london
conversations
with
me
and
the
attitude
of
poincaré
the
thought
comes
to
me
as
a
conviction
that
of
all
the
powers
france
is
the
only
one
which
not
to
say
that
it
wishes
war
would
yet
look
upon
it
without
great
regret
she
france
has
either
rightly
or
wrongly
complete
trust
in
her
army
the
old
effervescing
minority
has
again
shown
itself

perhaps

the
french
represented
by
mm
poincaré
millerand
and
delcassé
came
into
political
predominance
in
january
and
consolidated
its
ascendancy
one
year
later
when
raymond
poincaré
became
president
of
the
french
republic
all
through
there
was
an
immense
amount
of
correspondence
and
consultation
between
the
french
and
russian
governments
and
all
through
russia
showed
extraordinary
activity
in
military
preparation
in
england
asquith
government
had
to
face
a
strong
revulsion
of
popular
feeling
against
the
attitude
of
its
diplomacy
which
had
so
nearly
involved
the
country
in
war
with
germany
at
the
time
of
the
agadir
incident
as
always
the
figures
of
expenditure
tell
the
story
and
the
history
of
should
be
continually
illustrated
by
reference
to
the
financial
statistics
of
the
period
which
have
been
given
in
earlier
chapters
for
instance
russia
which
spent
in
round
numbers
million
on
new
naval
construction
in
spent
million
in
million
in
and
million
in
the
fact
that
as
professor
raymond
beazley
puts
it
in
the
ten
years
before
the
war
and
with
increasing
insistence
paris
and
petersburg
spent
upon
armaments
million
more
than
berlin
or
vienna
ought
to
suffice
at
least
to
reopen
the
question
of
responsibility
it
must
be
carefully
noted
that
by
the
spring
of
the
balkan
league
which
was
engineered
by
the
russian
diplomat
hartwig
was
fully
formed
this
put
the
diplomacy
of
the
balkan
states
under
the
direct
control
of
the
russian
foreign
office
it
now
became
necessary
for
the
russian
foreign
office
to
ascertain
in
case
war
between
serbia
and
austria
broke
out
and
germany
should
help
austria
and
russia
should
help
serbia
whether
russia
could
count
on
the
support
of
france
and
england
russia
received
this
assurance
in
secret
and
the
terms
of
it
were
discovered
by
the
soviet
government
in
the
archives
of
the
foreign
office
and
published
in
this
is
a
most
important
fact
and
should
be
continually
borne
in
mind
in
connexion
with
the
fact
that
the
war
was
precipitated
by
the
murder
of
the
austrian
archduke
by
serbian
officers
members
of
the
organization
fostered
and
encouraged
by
mm
isvolsky
and
hartwig
on
august
poincaré
then
premier
of
france
made
a
visit
to
petersburg
where
he
was
joined
by
his
kindred
spirit
isvolsky
who
was
then
the
russian
ambassador
at
paris
it
was
the
usual
visit
of
state
and
russia
staged
an
imposing
series
of
military
manoeuvres
in
poincaré
honour
but
the
really
important
events
that
took
place
were
these
first
a
naval
agreement
was
made
between
france
and
russia
whereby
france
agreed
to
concentrate
her
naval
forces
in
the
eastern
mediterranean
in
order
to
support
the
russian
navy
in
the
black
sea
this
agreement
was
secret
and
revealed
by
the
soviet
government
in
then
in
the
same
month
the
third
french
naval
squadron
was
transferred
from
the
atlantic
to
the
mediterranean
poincaré
told
isvolsky
that
this
decision
has
been
made
in
agreement
with
england
and
forms
the
further
development
and
completion
of
the
arrangement
already
made
previously
between
the
french
and
british
staffs
referring
to
the
conference
of
asquith
and
churchill
and
lord
kitchener
at
malta
the
month
before
at
which
the
new
disposition
of
the
english
and
french
fleets
was
decided
the
third
matter
of
consequence
that
took
place
in
the
month
of
august
was
that
the
russian
government
began
to
put
pressure
on
the
french
government
to
the
three
years
military
service
law
so
much
for
august
in
the
month
of
september
poincaré
gave
the
russian
foreign
minister
sazonov
assurance
that
if
germany
helped
austria
in
a
struggle
in
the
balkans
and
if
russia
were
drawn
in
on
the
other
side
france
would
not
hesitate
for
a
moment
to
fulfil
its
obligations
towards
russia
in
the
same
month
isvolsky
had
an
interview
with
the
king
of
england
and
sir
edward
grey
the
british
foreign
minister
in
which
both
king
george
and
sir
grey
assured
him
of
the
fullest
british
in
the
same
event
isvolsky
reported
to
the
russian
foreign
office
at
petersburg
that
grey
upon
his
own
initiative
corroborated
what
i
already
knew
from
poincaré
the
existence
of
an
agreement
between
france
and
great
britain
according
to
which
england
undertook
in
case
of
a
war
with
germany
not
only
to
come
to
the
assistance
of
france
on
the
sea
but
also
on
the
continent
by
landing
troops
these
two
understandings
between
mm
poincaré
and
sazonov
and
between
isvolsky
and
sir
grey
were
secret
and
nothing
was
known
of
them
until
when
the
memoranda
of
them
were
published
by
the
soviet
government
a
train
of
gunpowder
in
other
words
had
been
laid
from
belgrade
through
paris
and
london
to
petersburg
and
at
the
beginning
of
that
train
was
the
highly
inflammable
and
inflammatory
organized
by
hartwig
with
the
connivance
of
isvolsky
a
spark
struck
in
the
balkans
would
cause
the
train
to
flash
into
flame
throughout
its
entire
length
footnote
on
march
of
the
following
year
asquith
replying
to
a
question
in
the
commons
from
lord
hugh
cecil
denied
that
england
was
under
an
obligation
arising
owing
to
an
assurance
given
by
the
ministry
in
the
course
of
diplomatic
negotiations
to
send
a
very
large
armed
force
out
of
this
country
to
operate
in
europe
on
march
he
made
similar
denials
in
reply
to
questions
from
sir
byles
and
king
on
april
runciman
in
a
speech
at
birkenhead
denied
in
the
most
categorical
way
the
existence
of
a
secret
understanding
with
any
foreign
power
on
may
the
secretary
for
the
colonies
harcourt
declared
publicly
that
he
could
conceive
no
circumstances
in
which
continental
operations
would
not
be
a
crime
against
the
people
of
this
country
on
june
the
for
foreign
affairs
acland
declared
publicly
that
in
no
european
question
were
we
concerned
to
interfere
with
a
big
army
on
july
lord
loreburn
lord
chancellor
from
to
said
that
any
british
government
would
be
so
guilty
towards
our
country
as
to
take
up
arms
in
a
foreign
quarrel
is
more
than
i
can
believe
on
april
and
again
on
june
sir
grey
confirmed
in
the
house
of
commons
asquith
assertion
made
and
march
of
british
freedom
from
engagements
with
continental
powers
yet
curiously
the
professions
of
politicians
are
still
trusted
and
people
still
expect
something
from
their
machinations
they
expected
something
substantial
from
the
recent
conference
in
washington
on
the
limitation
of
armaments
for
instance
a
striking
and
pathetic
example
of
the
strength
of
superstition
xix
on
april
the
german
reichstag
put
through
its
first
reading
a
bill
with
only
perfunctory
debate
for
an
increase
in
the
german
army
and
navy
this
measure
has
been
regularly
and
officially
interpreted
as
a
threat
yet
nearly
a
year
after
on
february
baron
guillaume
writing
from
paris
about
the
prospects
of
the
three
years
service
bill
reports
to
the
belgian
foreign
office
that
the
french
minister
of
war
does
not
regard
the
measures
taken
by
germany
as
a
demonstration
of
hostility
but
rather
as
an
act
of
prudence
for
the
future
germany
fears
that
she
may
one
day
have
to
fight
russia
and
france
together
perhaps
england
too
and
then
any
help
that
austria
might
give
her
would
be
seriously
handicapped
by
the
fact
that
the
dual
monarchy
would
have
to
withstand
a
coalition
of
balkan
states
naturally
the
bill
was
presented
to
the
reichstag
in
april
and
the
coalition
of
balkan
states
hartwig
balkan
league
had
already
completed
its
organization
in
february
not
only
so
but
the
very
first
step
taken
by
this
exemplary
organization
provided
for
a
division
of
spoils
in
the
event
of
a
successful
war
with
turkey
and
six
months
after
the
organization
of
the
league
was
concluded
it
served
an
ultimatum
upon
turkey
over
albania
and
in
october
went
to
war
the
german
government
could
quite
plainly
see
the
future
about
to
be
inaugurated
through
this
consolidation
of
balkan
policy
into
the
hands
of
the
russian
foreign
office
any
one
even
an
attentive
reader
of
newspapers
could
see
it
and
it
could
see
the
vastly
increased
responsibility
of
its
austrian
ally
in
case
of
a
quarrel
should
it
have
to
take
on
a
coalition
of
the
balkan
states
instead
of
a
single
one
count
de
lalaing
reported
from
london
february
that
the
british
foreign
office
took
the
same
sensible
view
of
the
german
military
increases
as
according
to
baron
guillaume
was
taken
by
jonnart
the
english
press
he
says
is
of
course
anxious
to
saddle
germany
with
the
responsibility
for
the
fresh
tension
caused
by
her
schemes
a
tension
which
may
give
europe
fresh
reasons
for
uneasiness
but
he
goes
on
at
the
foreign
office
i
found
a
more
equitable
and
calmer
estimate
of
the
situation
they
see
in
the
reinforcement
of
the
german
armies
not
so
much
a
provocation
as
an
admission
that
circumstances
have
weakened
germany
military
position
and
that
it
must
be
strengthened
the
berlin
government
is
compelled
to
recognize
that
it
can
no
longer
count
upon
being
supported
by
the
whole
force
of
its
austrian
ally
now
that
a
new
power
that
of
the
balkan
federation
has
made
its
appearance
in
europe
right
at
the
gates
of
the
dual
empire
under
these
circumstances
the
foreign
office
sees
nothing
astonishing
in
germany
finding
it
imperative
to
increase
the
number
of
her
army
corps
the
foreign
office
also
states
that
the
berlin
government
had
told
the
paris
cabinet
quite
frankly
that
such
were
the
motives
for
its
action
the
same
view
was
publicly
expressed
by
lloyd
george
himself
as
late
as
january
when
he
said
the
german
army
was
vital
not
merely
to
the
existence
of
the
german
empire
but
to
the
very
life
and
independence
of
the
nation
itself
surrounded
as
germany
is
by
other
nations
each
of
which
possesses
armies
as
powerful
as
her
own
we
forget
that
while
we
insist
upon
a
superiority
as
far
as
our
naval
strength
is
concerned
over
germany
being
essential
to
guarantee
the
integrity
of
our
own
shores
germany
herself
has
nothing
like
that
superiority
over
france
alone
and
she
has
of
course
in
addition
to
reckon
with
russia
on
her
eastern
frontier
germany
has
nothing
which
approximates
to
a
standard
she
has
therefore
become
alarmed
by
recent
issues
and
is
spending
huge
sums
of
money
on
the
expansion
of
her
military
resources
those
are
the
words
be
it
remembered
of
the
same
person
who
says
that
german
responsibility
for
the
war
which
broke
out
six
months
after
he
had
made
the
foregoing
statement
is
a
the
statement
was
made
furthermore
not
only
the
german
bill
of
april
but
the
bill
of
april
as
well
which
fixed
the
of
the
german
army
at
the
three
years
service
law
passed
the
french
chamber
in
august
after
a
passionate
popular
campaign
of
this
measure
baron
guillaume
says
that
the
french
newspapers
in
particular
are
wrong
in
representing
the
french
government
plans
as
being
in
response
to
measures
adopted
by
germany
many
of
them
are
but
the
outcome
of
measures
which
have
long
been
prepared
the
french
minister
jonnart
told
him
that
we
know
very
well
what
an
advantage
our
neighbour
germany
has
in
the
continual
growth
of
his
population
still
we
must
do
all
that
lies
in
our
power
to
compensate
this
advantage
by
better
military
organization
probably
this
view
of
the
three
years
service
law
was
the
view
held
by
all
save
the
relatively
small
and
and
in
so
far
as
military
measures
are
ever
reasonable
this
like
the
corresponding
measures
taken
in
germany
must
be
regarded
as
reasonable
as
pichon
told
baron
guillaume
we
are
not
arming
for
war
we
are
arming
to
avoid
it
to
exorcise
it
we
must
go
on
arming
more
and
more
in
order
to
prevent
war
there
is
no
reason
whatever
to
suppose
that
this
view
was
not
sincerely
entertained
by
pichon
and
by
many
others
probably
by
a
majority
of
the
persons
most
responsibly
concerned
but
the
consequences
of
the
three
years
service
law
were
contemplated
by
baron
guillaume
with
great
apprehension
he
reports
on
june
that
the
burden
of
the
new
law
will
fall
so
heavily
upon
the
population
and
the
expenditure
which
it
will
involve
will
be
so
exorbitant
that
there
will
soon
be
an
outcry
in
the
country
and
france
will
be
faced
with
this
dilemma
either
renounce
what
she
can
not
bear
to
forgo
or
else
war
at
short
notice
of
the
militarist
party
now
in
the
ascendancy
he
says
they
are
followed
with
a
sort
of
infatuation
a
kind
of
frenzy
which
is
interesting
but
deplorable
one
is
not
now
allowed
under
pain
of
being
marked
as
a
traitor
to
express
even
a
doubt
of
the
need
for
the
three
years
service
public
opinion
was
evidently
confiscated
by
the
group
much
as
it
was
in
the
united
states
in
by
the
headed
by
wilson
baron
guillaume
uses
words
that
must
remind
us
of
those
days
every
one
knows
he
says
that
the
mass
of
the
nation
is
by
no
means
in
favour
of
the
projected
reform
and
they
understand
the
danger
that
lies
ahead
but
they
shut
their
eyes
and
press
on
xx
the
train
of
powder
however
had
been
laid
by
the
diplomatic
engagements
and
serbia
came
into
collision
in
the
spring
of
over
the
scutari
incident
in
december
sazonov
had
urged
serbia
to
play
a
waiting
game
in
order
to
deliver
a
blow
at
austria
but
on
april
baron
beyens
reports
from
berlin
that
the
arrogance
and
contempt
with
which
the
serbs
receive
the
vienna
cabinet
protests
over
scutari
can
only
be
explained
by
their
belief
that
petersburg
will
support
them
the
serbian
chargé
was
quite
openly
saying
here
lately
that
his
government
would
not
have
persisted
in
its
course
for
the
last
six
months
in
the
face
of
the
austrian
opposition
had
they
not
received
encouragement
in
their
course
from
the
russian
minister
de
hartwig
who
is
a
diplomatist
of
isvolsky
school
sazonov
heart
is
with
his
colleagues
who
are
directing
the
policy
of
the
great
powers
but
he
feels
his
influence
with
the
tsar
being
undermined
by
the
and
the
hence
his
inconsequent
behaviour
the
military
activity
which
the
russian
government
displayed
in
gives
interest
to
this
estimate
of
sazonov
position
no
doubt
to
some
extent
the
estimate
was
correct
sazonov
like
sir
grey
was
probably
when
it
was
too
late
much
disquieted
by
the
events
which
marshalled
him
the
way
that
he
was
going
in
this
military
activity
gained
extraordinary
intensity
the
russian
army
was
put
upon
a
of
approximately
an
effective
numerical
strength
hitherto
unprecedented
said
the
petersburg
correspondent
of
the
london
from
january
to
june
the
russian
government
made
immense
purchases
of
war
material
in
february
it
concluded
a
loan
in
paris
for
the
improvement
of
its
strategic
roads
and
railways
on
the
german
frontier
russia
as
was
generally
known
at
the
time
had
her
eye
on
the
acquisition
of
constantinople
and
in
the
same
month
february
a
council
of
war
was
held
in
petersburg
to
work
out
a
general
programme
of
action
in
order
to
secure
for
us
a
favourable
solution
of
the
historical
question
of
the
straits
in
march
the
petersburg
newspaper
which
served
as
the
mouthpiece
of
the
minister
of
war
published
an
article
stating
that
russia
strategy
would
no
longer
be
defensive
but
active
another
paper
spoke
of
the
time
coming
when
the
crossing
of
the
austrian
frontier
by
the
russian
army
would
be
an
unavoidable
decision
in
the
same
month
russia
raised
a
heavy
tariff
against
the
importation
of
german
grain
and
flour
thus
bearing
out
the
evidence
of
german
that
even
at
this
time
germany
was
still
exporting
grain
to
russia
a
most
extraordinary
proceeding
for
a
nation
which
contemplated
a
sudden
declaration
of
war
before
the
next
harvest
in
the
same
month
the
russian
government
brought
in
military
estimates
of
million
it
exercised
heavy
pressure
on
the
french
government
in
the
protracted
political
turmoil
over
the
maintenance
of
the
three
years
service
law
in
april
trial
mobilizations
were
begun
and
were
continued
up
to
the
outbreak
of
the
war
in
may
sazonov
informed
the
tsar
that
the
british
government
has
decided
to
empower
the
british
admiralty
staff
to
enter
into
negotiations
with
french
and
russian
naval
agents
in
london
for
the
purpose
of
drawing
technical
conditions
for
possible
action
by
the
naval
forces
of
england
russia
and
france
in
the
same
month
a
complete
mobilization
of
all
the
reserves
of
the
three
annual
contingents
of
was
ordered
for
the
whole
russian
empire
as
a
test
to
take
place
in
the
autumn
in
the
same
month
the
russian
admiralty
instructed
its
agent
in
london
captain
volkov
as
follows
our
interests
on
the
northern
scene
of
operations
require
that
england
keeps
as
large
a
part
of
the
german
fleet
as
possible
in
check
in
the
north
sea
the
english
government
could
render
us
a
substantial
service
if
it
would
agree
to
send
a
sufficient
number
of
boats
to
our
baltic
ports
to
compensate
for
our
lack
of
means
of
transport
before
the
beginning
of
this
document
revealed
by
the
soviet
government
in
is
pretty
damaging
to
the
assumption
of
an
unprepared
and
unsuspecting
europe
especially
as
professor
conybeare
has
given
publicity
to
the
fact
that
before
the
beginning
of
those
english
boats
were
there
prompt
to
the
minute
empty
ready
and
waiting
in
june
the
russian
ambassador
warned
the
russian
naval
staff
in
london
that
they
must
exercise
great
caution
in
talking
about
a
landing
in
pomerania
or
about
the
dispatch
of
english
boats
to
the
russian
baltic
ports
before
the
outbreak
of
war
so
that
the
rest
may
not
be
jeopardized
on
june
the
of
the
russian
minister
of
war
published
an
inspired
article
under
the
caption
russia
is
ready
france
must
be
ready
two
weeks
later
the
austrian
the
archduke
francis
joseph
was
murdered
at
sarajevo
a
town
in
bosnia
by
serbian
officers
the
murder
was
arranged
by
the
serbian
major
tankesitch
of
the
organization
known
as
the
black
hand
and
this
organization
was
fostered
if
not
actually
subsidized
by
the
russian
minister
at
belgrade
