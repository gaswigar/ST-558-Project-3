chapter

punch
and
the
when
the
little
boy
first
went
to
the
old
tobacco
shop
he
stood
a
long
while
before
going
in
to
look
at
the
wooden
figure
which
stood
beside
the
door
his
father
was
sitting
at
home
in
his
waiting
for
tobacco
for
his
pipe
but
when
the
little
boy
saw
the
wooden
figure
he
forgot
all
about
hurrying
now
do
be
long
his
mother
had
said
and
his
father
had
said
hurry
back
but
he
forgot
all
about
hurrying
and
stood
and
looked
at
the
wooden
figure
a
long
time
a
little
hunchbacked
man
not
so
very
much
taller
than
himself
on
a
low
wooden
box
holding
out
in
one
hand
a
packet
of
black
wooden
cigars
his
back
was
terribly
humped
up
between
his
shoulders
his
face
was
square
and
bony
if
wood
can
be
said
to
be
bony
he
was
bareheaded
and
he
had
a
wide
mouth
and
his
high
nose
curved
down
over
it
and
his
pointed
chin
curved
up
under
it
and
his
breast
stuck
out
in
front
almost
as
much
as
his
shoulders
stuck
out
behind
the
little
boy
name
was
freddie
his
mother
called
him
that
and
his
father
usually
called
him
fred
but
sometimes
his
father
called
him
frederick
in
fact
whenever
he
did
come
back
after
he
had
been
told
to
hurry
and
then
his
father
looked
at
him
you
know
that
look
and
said
frederick
just
like
that
but
his
mother
never
called
him
anything
but
freddie
even
when
he
was
late
he
grasped
his
money
tight
in
his
hand
as
he
had
been
told
to
do
and
stood
and
looked
at
the
little
hunchbacked
wooden
man
holding
out
his
packet
of
black
wooden
cigars
i
wonder
thought
freddie
what
makes
him
so
crooked
he
walked
around
him
and
looked
at
his
back
he
walked
around
in
front
of
him
again
and
wondered
if
the
black
cigars
in
his
hand
would
smoke
he
decided
he
would
ask
about
it
the
little
man
wore
blue
knee
breeches
and
black
stockings
and
buckled
shoes
and
his
coat
was
cut
away
in
front
over
his
stomach
and
had
two
tails
behind
down
to
his
knees
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
was
a
boy
though
even
if
he
did
wear
knee
breeches
you
only
had
to
look
at
his
face
for
he
had
the
kind
of
hard
boniness
in
his
face
that
have
freddie
made
up
his
mind
that
he
liked
him
anyway
and
it
must
have
been
hard
to
have
to
stand
out
there
all
day
without
moving
rain
or
shine
and
offer
that
bunch
of
cigars
to
all
the
people
who
went
by
and
never
get
a
single
soul
to
take
them
freddie
put
out
his
other
hand
not
the
one
with
the
money
in
it
towards
the
cigars
but
he
quickly
drew
it
back
for
he
looked
at
the
little
man
face
at
the
same
time
and
there
was
something
about
his
eyes
anyhow
he
stood
back
a
little
better
be
careful
o
punch
young
feller
said
a
deep
voice
from
the
shop
door
freddie
looked
and
in
the
doorway
leaning
against
the
doorpost
with
his
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
and
one
foot
crossed
over
the
other
stood
a
little
man
not
so
very
much
taller
than
himself
and
certainly
no
taller
than
the
figure
on
the
stand
who
stared
at
freddie
as
if
he
knew
all
about
human
boys
and
did
not
trust
them
out
of
his
sight
freddie
looked
at
him
and
then
at
the
wooden
figure
beside
the
door
they
might
have
been
brothers
the
little
man
had
a
hump
on
his
back
and
his
breast
stuck
out
in
front
his
head
was
big
and
square
and
he
had
high
his
face
was
bony
and
his
mouth
wide
and
his
big
nose
curved
down
and
his
chin
curved
up
but
he
did
not
wear
knee
breeches
his
trousers
were
the
trousers
of
and
his
coat
was
a
square
coat
buttoned
tight
over
his
chest
from
top
to
bottom
he
was
bareheaded
and
he
had
plenty
of
hair
brushed
from
the
top
of
his
head
down
towards
his
forehead
he
looked
as
if
he
belonged
to
the
tobacco
shop
or
perhaps
the
tobacco
shop
belonged
to
him
he
stared
at
freddie
without
blinking
and
there
was
something
in
his
eyes
anyway
freddie
stepped
back
and
held
his
money
tighter
in
his
hand
behind
him
you
stand
away
from
punch
said
the
hunchbacked
man
without
moving
yes
sir
said
freddie
did
you
say
because
you
know
i
terrible
deef
and
ca
never
hear
boys
when
they
talk
down
in
their
stomicks
i
you
why
as
long
as
you
ast
me
do
you
see
that
clock
on
the
over
there
he
nodded
his
big
wooden
head
up
the
street
without
taking
his
hands
from
his
pockets
freddie
looked
and
there
the
clock
was
plain
enough
well
said
the
hunchbacked
man
i
tell
you
seeing
as
you
insist
upon
it
and
wo
take
no
for
an
answer
but
you
must
never
tell
it
to
no
one
do
you
promise
me
that
cross
your
heart
yes
sir
said
freddie
done
said
the
hunchback
punch
father
lives
up
there
behind
that
clock
and
sometimes
just
exactly
when
the
two
hands
of
that
clock
come
together
one
on
top
of
the
other
mind
you
like
you
lay
one
stick
along
another
punch
father
comes
out
and
stands
on
that
there
sill
under
the
clock
he
a
little
old
man
with
a
long
white
beard
and
he
stands
there
and
puts
his
hand
to
his
mouth
and
calls
down
here
to
punch
and
punch
climbs
down
off
his
little
perch
and
goes
over
to
that
church
and
climbs
up
the
inside
of
that
tower
to
the
very
top
and
meets
his
father
and
i
heard
tell
that
they
have
regular
high
jinks
up
there
all
by
theirselves
and
vittles
more
vittles
and
drink
than
you
ever
seen
at
one
time
yes
sir
a
regular
feast
as
sure
as
you
born
and
they
do
only
eat
vittles
no
sir
if
they
can
only
get
hold
of
a
nice
plump
little
boy
or
two
with
plenty
o
meat
to
him
that
what
they
like
best
and
if
it
happens
to
be
a
lot
of
queer
ones
with
up
there
and
all
sorts
of
queer
noises
you
ask
the
sextant
over
there
about
it
heard
and
if
you
should
just
happen
to
be
around
when
punch
climbs
down
off
of
this
here
perch
you
better
look
out
for
he
just
as
likely
as
not
to
snatch
you
up
and
carry
you
off
with
him
up
there
into
that
to
his
father
and
if
he
does
that
the
last
of
you
and
your
ma
and
your
pa
could
cry
their
eyes
out
and
it
be
no
use
you
be
and
never
come
back
no
more
they
say
there
many
a
boy
been
took
up
into
that
tower
by
punch
here
when
his
father
comes
out
and
calls
him
but
he
do
come
out
when
the
hands
of
the
clock
come
together
nobody
ever
knows
when
he
going
to
do
it
no
sirree
punch
himself
never
knows
when
his
going
to
call
him
lord
bless
us
cried
the
little
hunchback
looking
up
again
in
alarm
at
the
clock
in
the
lord
bless
us
look
at
that
freddie
stared
at
the
clock
it
was
minutes
past
five
he
knew
how
to
tell
twelve
and
ten
minutes
to
ten
but
he
had
never
got
as
far
as
minutes
past
five
he
could
easily
see
however
that
the
big
hand
was
almost
on
top
of
the
little
hand
he
edged
away
further
from
the
wooden
figure
on
the
box
he
was
almost
sure
that
the
hand
which
held
the
cigars
moved
a
little
the
hunchbacked
man
in
the
doorway
stood
up
straight
on
his
two
feet
and
took
his
hands
out
of
his
pockets
look
alive
young
feller
he
said
it
pretty
near
time
in
another
minute
i
ca
help
it
if
punch
father
comes
out
and
quick
boy
come
here
to
me
before
it
too
late
i
see
if
i
can
save
you
freddie
gave
another
look
at
the
clock
the
hands
were
surely
almost
together
and
quick
as
a
flash
he
darted
to
the
hunchback
and
hid
behind
him
and
held
on
to
his
coat
peeping
around
him
through
the
doorway
the
little
man
put
his
arm
about
freddie
and
held
him
close
it
was
a
strong
muscular
arm
and
freddie
felt
quite
safe
the
little
man
could
not
have
been
laughing
for
his
face
was
as
solemn
and
as
ever
but
freddie
could
feel
his
body
shaking
all
over
he
could
tell
why
you
better
come
in
and
see
aunt
amanda
he
said
before
it
too
late
you
be
safe
in
there
he
took
freddie
by
the
hand
and
drew
him
into
the
shop
the
old
tobacco
shop
stands
at
the
corner
of
two
streets
as
you
surely
must
know
if
you
have
ever
been
in
the
city
that
lies
on
the
river
called
patapsco
which
runs
along
ever
so
far
out
of
a
great
bay
where
ships
sail
from
all
over
the
world
called
chesapeake
bay
it
is
an
old
brick
house
and
you
go
into
the
shop
by
the
door
that
opens
in
the
side
just
round
the
corner
not
in
the
front
for
there
is
any
door
at
the
front
but
only
a
window
with
pipes
and
cigars
and
tobacco
in
it
and
the
stuffed
head
of
a
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
the
house
is
only
one
story
and
a
half
high
and
has
a
steep
gabled
roof
with
two
dormer
windows
in
the
slope
of
the
roof
above
the
side
of
the
house
and
one
dormer
window
in
the
slope
of
the
roof
above
the
in
front
where
the
is
all
the
other
houses
fronting
in
the
row
are
good
high
houses
why
this
corner
house
never
grew
up
like
the
others
no
one
knows
when
freddie
was
standing
at
the
corner
of
the
street
before
he
had
seen
the
wooden
figure
offering
his
bundle
of
wooden
cigars
there
beside
the
door
he
looked
down
the
street
that
runs
along
the
side
of
the
shop
across
the
street
that
crosses
it
and
saw
the
masts
of
tall
ships
in
the
harbor
beside
the
wharves
some
with
their
sails
up
some
with
their
sails
hanging
most
untidily
and
some
with
their
sails
neatly
rolled
up
and
tied
and
he
would
certainly
have
gone
down
there
only
his
father
had
told
him
to
hurry
freddie
lived
in
a
fine
brick
house
in
a
row
like
this
one
a
long
long
way
off
three
squares
off
they
say
squares
in
that
city
when
they
mean
a
straight
line
between
two
streets
and
not
a
square
at
all
down
the
same
street
on
which
the
old
tobacco
shop
fronts
and
it
really
takes
a
good
while
to
go
all
that
way
for
there
is
a
boy
down
a
big
boy
who
belongs
to
a
gang
and
likes
to
bully
little
boys
and
you
have
to
watch
your
chance
to
get
out
of
his
way
and
there
is
a
place
with
a
in
the
fence
where
you
can
see
all
kinds
of
rusty
springs
and
and
birdcages
and
barrel
hoops
piled
up
inside
the
yard
and
a
factory
where
you
can
pick
up
little
round
pieces
of
tin
just
as
good
as
dollars
and
a
church
where
the
clock
is
with
a
fat
old
man
sitting
on
the
pavement
in
a
chair
tilted
back
against
the
church
wall
smoking
a
long
pipe
who
mind
being
stared
at
from
the
curbstone
and
a
track
where
you
have
to
look
out
for
the
which
is
very
dangerous
when
the
horse
begins
to
trot
and
but
freddie
had
lived
long
in
his
fine
house
in
that
street
and
these
things
were
new
to
him
and
took
time
but
the
newest
and
biggest
thing
he
had
yet
found
not
that
it
was
really
big
you
know
was
the
wooden
hunchback
outside
the
door
of
the
old
tobacco
shop
and
you
have
seen
how
much
time
took
freddie
found
himself
inside
the
shop
and
his
hand
grasped
tight
by
the
big
strong
hand
of
the
hunchback
so
tight
that
he
wriggled
a
little
to
get
loose
but
the
hunchback
only
held
him
tighter
come
along
he
said
you
better
come
in
here
and
see
my
aunt
amanda
or
punch
may
step
out
and
get
you
and
where
would
you
be
freddie
looked
back
out
of
doors
over
his
shoulder
but
it
did
not
seem
as
if
punch
meant
to
step
out
that
time
he
breathed
easier
the
shop
was
a
very
little
shop
with
shelves
on
the
wall
behind
the
counter
and
a
window
in
front
where
he
saw
the
back
of
the
head
the
two
on
the
counter
were
full
of
pipes
of
all
kinds
and
cigars
and
tobacco
and
cigarettes
and
piled
on
the
shelves
were
boxes
of
cigars
and
jars
and
tins
of
tobacco
and
on
the
wooden
top
of
the
counter
between
the
two
stood
a
and
a
little
pair
of
scales
with
a
scoop
lying
beside
it
and
little
iron
weights
in
a
box
the
counter
ran
from
the
front
window
lengthwise
to
the
back
of
the
shop
and
at
the
back
on
your
left
as
you
went
in
was
a
closed
door
a
wooden
chair
with
arms
stood
beside
the
front
window
you
could
get
behind
the
counter
only
by
a
swinging
gate
at
the
back
end
there
was
a
delightful
warm
odour
about
the
place
very
much
the
same
odour
freddie
liked
to
smell
when
his
father
opened
his
old
on
the
in
the
upstairs
and
filled
his
pipe
when
he
came
home
in
the
evening
and
put
on
his
and
spread
out
that
everlasting
newspaper
that
had
no
pictures
in
it
he
never
could
understand
why
his
mother
opened
all
the
windows
the
next
morning
all
right
young
feller
said
the
hunchback
we
get
on
the
other
side
of
that
door
and
then
we
be
safe
here
we
are
they
reached
the
door
at
the
back
of
the
shop
and
the
hunchback
opened
it
and
pulled
freddie
into
the
back
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
them
freddie
hung
back
a
little
but
his
hand
was
gripped
tight
and
he
could
have
got
away
if
he
had
tugged
with
all
his
might
he
was
not
so
much
afraid
now
of
punch
and
his
father
but
he
did
know
what
this
little
man
was
going
to
do
with
him
and
besides
his
father
had
told
him
to
hurry
in
this
back
room
near
a
window
which
looked
out
on
the
street
sat
a
lady
the
hunchback
marched
freddie
up
to
her
and
stopped
there
before
her
and
wagged
his
head
sidewise
towards
the
little
boy
the
hunchback
and
the
little
boy
stood
hand
in
hand
and
the
lady
looked
at
them
steadily
chapter
ii
aunt
amanda
and
the
two
old
codgers
here
aunt
amanda
said
the
hunchback
standing
before
the
lady
who
was
sitting
near
the
window
and
letting
go
of
freddie
hand
and
here
a
boy
that
punch
pretty
near
got
hold
of
if
i
had
come
along
just
in
time
and
hustled
him
in
here
just
look
out
of
that
window
aunt
amanda
and
see
if
punch
has
moved
yet
the
lady
did
not
look
out
of
the
window
but
stared
at
freddie
with
her
mouth
shut
tight
she
had
very
thin
lips
and
she
pressed
them
tight
together
and
without
opening
them
more
than
a
wee
mite
she
said
to
the
hunchback
sternly
obelilackyoomuptwonyerix
freddie
could
not
understand
this
at
all
he
looked
at
her
closely
she
was
very
thin
and
had
a
high
beaked
nose
and
reddish
hair
and
a
reddish
skin
and
on
the
left
side
of
her
chin
was
a
mole
with
three
little
reddish
hairs
sticking
out
of
it
she
wore
a
rusty
black
dress
very
tight
above
the
waist
and
very
wide
below
and
in
the
bosom
of
this
dress
were
sticking
dozens
maybe
hundreds
for
all
freddie
could
tell
of
pins
and
needles
she
must
have
been
very
tall
when
she
stood
up
a
cane
leaned
against
the
back
of
her
chair
she
was
a
little
lame
not
very
lame
but
enough
to
make
her
limp
when
she
walked
and
to
make
her
cane
useful
in
getting
about
if
she
had
had
a
stiff
starched
ruff
about
her
neck
and
a
lace
thing
on
her
head
pointed
in
front
she
would
have
done
very
well
for
queen
elizabeth
the
one
you
see
the
picture
of
in
that
there
was
a
thimble
on
the
second
finger
of
her
right
hand
and
a
pair
of
scissors
hung
by
a
tape
at
her
waist
and
around
her
neck
she
wore
a
measuring
tape
on
the
floor
at
her
feet
lay
a
pile
of
goods
and
some
of
it
was
in
her
lap
the
kind
of
goods
that
mother
has
around
her
when
she
is
turning
and
making
over
that
old
blue
serge
and
gathers
up
out
of
father
way
when
she
hears
him
coming
in
towards
the
at
aunt
amanda
elbow
stood
an
oval
table
and
besides
a
there
were
several
fascinating
things
on
it
in
the
center
was
a
glass
dome
and
under
the
glass
dome
was
the
most
beautiful
basket
of
wax
flowers
calla
lilies
mostly
with
a
wonderful
yellow
spike
like
a
finger
sticking
up
out
of
each
one
on
one
side
of
the
wax
flowers
was
a
thick
book
with
blue
plush
covers
and
the
word
album
across
it
in
slanting
gold
letters
on
the
other
side
was
a
kind
of
a
well
it
had
a
handle
under
a
piece
of
wood
to
hold
it
up
by
and
a
frame
at
one
end
to
stick
up
a
picture
in
and
two
pieces
of
thick
glass
in
a
frame
at
the
other
end
to
look
through
at
the
picture
and
make
the
picture
look
all
know
as
if
the
people
in
the
back
of
it
were
a
long
way
behind
and
the
people
in
front
right
close
up
in
front
and
all
that
freddie
father
had
one
the
chairs
in
the
room
had
thin
curved
legs
and
those
slippery
seats
which
freddie
hated
to
sit
on
on
the
walls
were
portraits
in
oval
frames
of
men
with
and
no
mustaches
and
ladies
in
shawls
and
bonnets
but
there
was
one
square
frame
and
it
had
no
picture
under
its
glass
but
a
sheaf
of
real
wheat
standing
up
as
natural
as
life
with
some
kind
of
curly
writing
over
it
it
was
simply
beautiful
there
was
a
clock
on
the
marble
tall
and
with
a
clear
circle
in
the
glass
below
where
you
could
see
the
round
weight
of
the
pendulum
go
back
and
forth
and
a
picture
of
the
sun
on
the
face
very
red
with
a
big
nose
and
eyes
and
stiff
red
hair
floating
off
from
it
aunt
amanda
stuck
a
pin
in
the
goods
in
her
lap
and
folded
her
hands
freddie
after
glancing
around
the
room
looked
at
her
again
and
wondered
who
she
was
plain
sewing
she
was
that
was
sure
also
an
aunt
and
besides
that
although
freddie
did
not
know
it
she
was
an
old
i
hate
to
say
it
though
it
was
anything
really
against
her
if
you
come
to
that
an
old
well
you
know
what
you
call
them
behind
their
backs
or
shout
after
them
as
they
go
down
the
street
and
then
whip
around
the
corner
when
they
turn
just
simply
because
they
have
ever
been
married
like
mother
well
then
an
old
maid
being
an
old
maid
she
of
course
wore
no
wedding
ring
but
on
her
the
third
finger
of
her
left
hand
there
was
a
mark
at
the
place
where
a
wedding
ring
would
have
been
a
kind
of
ruby
red
in
shape
and
size
like
the
ruby
stone
of
a
ring
freddie
looked
at
it
often
afterwards
now
you
look
here
aunt
amanda
said
her
nephew
taking
hold
of
freddie
hand
again
you
know
well
enough
i
ca
understand
you
with
all
them
pins
aunt
amanda
put
a
hand
to
her
lips
and
drew
out
of
her
mouth
a
pin
and
stuck
it
in
the
bosom
of
her
dress
she
put
her
hand
to
her
lips
again
and
drew
forth
another
pin
and
stuck
it
in
the
bosom
of
her
dress
she
drew
forth
another
and
another
and
stuck
each
one
in
her
dress
freddie
eyes
opened
wide
did
this
lady
eat
pins
her
mouth
seemed
to
be
full
of
them
did
they
hurt
it
did
seem
possible
she
could
eat
them
and
yet
there
they
were
no
wonder
she
could
talk
plainly
there
seemed
to
be
no
end
to
the
pins
but
there
was
and
at
last
her
mouth
was
clear
of
them
so
that
she
could
talk
toby

visitors
and
he

tried

a
time
to

rosy
redness
from
his
cheeks
but
he
had
found
it
only
made
it
worse
he
hung
his
head
a
little
and
could
not
find

voice
aunt

no

in

and
littleback
the

went
through

after

think

the
bottle
o
milk

time
but

man
o
good
common
sense
nothing

he
turned
to
the
shelf
behind
him
and
mounted
a
little
ladder
and
took
down
a
large
tin
while
he
was
scooping
out
the
tobacco
at
the
counter
and
weighing
it
on
the
scales
and
doing
it
up
he
was
singing
to
himself
and
freddie
stared
at
him
with
rapt
attention
some
day
said
littleback
without
pausing
in
his
work
or
looking
at
freddie
them
eyes
of
yourn
will
pop
right
out
of
your
head
if
you
ai
careful
did
you
ever
hear
that
song
no
sir
said
freddie
would
you
like
to
hear
it
yes
sir
said
freddie
it
about
two
old
codgers
friends
of
mine
they
come
in
here
regular
one
of
a
good
customer
and
pays
spot
cash
the
other
one
never
buys
nothing
and
i
ca
say
which
one
of
i
like
worse
anyway
here
how
it
goes
there
was
an
old
codger
and
he
had
a
wooden
leg
and
he
never
bought
tobacco
when
tobacco
he
could
beg
do
you
never
let
yourself
get
into
that
habit
young
man
always
buy
your
tobacco
fair
and
square
i
known
this
feller
and
many
another
one
never
have
a
grain
o
tobacco
left
in
their
pouch
just
used
up
the
very
last
bit
two
minutes
before
and
always
a
pipeful
and
right
here
in
my
own
shop
too
where
i
tobacco
mind
you
i
like
better
if
they
sneaked
in
and
it
i
would
any
day
but
the
other
one
i
do
know
that
i
want
to
be
him
neither
if
i
had
to
choose
between
however
another
old
codger
as
sly
as
a
fox
and
he
always
had
tobacco
in
his
old
tobacco
box
count
on
him
for
that
never
begs
no
tobacco
nor
gives
away
none
either
however
he
ai
such
a
general
nuisance
as
the
other
one
and
he
pays
spot
cash
i
have
to
say
that
much
for
him
but
in
spite
everything
and
all
i
ca
seem
to
make
myself
care
for
him
much
anyway
said
the
one
old
codger
wo
ye
gim
me
a
chew
said
the
other
old
codger
i
be
hanged
if
i
do
they
a
fine
pair
now

of
a
nuisance
and
the
other
one

mean
freddie

you
yes
sir
why
do
you
say
what
you
mean
well
freddie

plenty
of
tobacco
left
in
this
shop
so
you
can
come
in
whenever
the
old
tobacco
box
at
home
runs
out
and
do
forget
to
come
in
to
see
aunt
amanda
plenty
of
goods
left
in
the
shop
whenever
you
see
all
that
he
pointed
up
towards
the
shelves
i
tell
you
something
i
ai
told
to
but
mighty
few
people
before
there
a
jar
of
smoking
tobacco
up
there
that
just
plain
magic
magic
you
know
what
that
means
freddie
started
and
looked
up
at
the
shelves
in
alarm
he
nodded
it
that
one
on
the
middle
shelf
the
chinaman
head
do
you
see
it
he
pointed
to
a
white
porcelain
jar
shaped
like
a
human
head
freddie
could
see
that
it
was
the
head
of
some
foreign
kind
of
man
with
a
little
round
blue
cap
on
top
which
was
probably
the
lid
that
tobacco
in
that
chinaman
head
is
magic
as
sure
as
you
alive
i
would
smoke
it
if
you
give
me
all
the
plum
puddings
in
this
city
next
christmas
no
sir
and
i
would
allow
nobody
else
to
smoke
it
neither
i
just
naturally
would
dare
to
do
you
know
where
that
tobacco
come
from
a
sailor
off
of
one
them
ships
down
there
in
the
harbor
that
come
all
the
way
from
china
yes
sir
give
it
to
me
once
for
a
quid
of
what
you
might
call
broke
he
was
and
it
was
any
use
to
him
because
he
did
smoke
but
he
did
chew
and
he
told
me
all
about
it
he
stole
it
from
an
old
sorcerer
in
china
where
he
just
come
from
do
you
never
touch
it
i
would
want
to
be
in
your
boots
if
you
ever
smoked
that
tobacco
in
that
there
chinaman
head
you
can
steal
anything
else
in
this
shop
and
it
would
do
much
harm
to
anybody
but
you
keep
your
hands
off
of
that
chinaman
tobacco
mind
what
i
telling
you
yes
sir
said
freddie
he
had
never
thought
about
smoking
before
in
connection
with
himself
but
now
for
the
first
time
he
began
to
wish
that
he
knew
how
to
smoke
it
would
be
worth
risking
something
to
take
a
whiff
or
two
of
the
magic
tobacco
in
that
chinaman
head
just
to
see
what
would
happen
do
you
think
you
better
go
home
now
said
littleback
yes
sir
said
freddie
my
farver
told
me
to
hurry
oh
he
did
indeed
the
hunchback
followed
freddie
to
the
door
and
they
looked
up
together
at
the
clock
in
the
ah
said
toby
you
safe
just
six
punch
father
ca
come
out
for
about
half
an
hour
yet
freddie
looked
back
as
he
crossed
the
street
and
saw
the
live
hunchback
leaning
against
the
wooden
hunchback
with
one
foot
crossed
over
the
other
he
could
hardly
tell
which
was
which
except
for
the
coat
and
breeches
he
went
on
up
the
street
with
his
package
of
tobacco
in
one
hand
and
his
package
of
gingerbread
in
the
other
as
he
passed
the
church
he
lingered
a
moment
to
stare
at
the
great
fat
man
with
spectacles
who
was
sitting
on
the
pavement
in
a
chair
tilted
back
against
the
smoking
a
long
pipe
and
reading
a
newspaper
could
this
be
the
sextant
of
the
church
whom
toby
had
mentioned
and
who
had
heard
the
queer
noises
from
the
top
of
the
tower
when
punch
and
his
father
were
up
there
having
their
high
jinks
he
tried
to
get
up
his
courage
to
ask
the
fat
man
about
it
but
he
could
not
get
the
words
out
he
stared
so
long
that
the
fat
man
finally
put
down
his
paper
and
took
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
looked
over
his
spectacles
and
said
if
you
considerin
making
a
bid
for
the
property
young
man
see
what
the
senior
churchwarden
has
to
say
about
it
how
much
do
you
offer
no
sir
said
freddie
blushing
in
confusion
and
went
on
up
the
street
he
understood
nothing
of
what
the
fat
man
had
said
but
he
caught
the
word
churchwarden
and
remembered
it
he
did
not
walk
very
fast
for
he
had
a
good
deal
to
think
about
so
many
things
had
never
happened
to
him
in
one
day
before
he
dwelt
especially
in
his
mind
on
the
two
old
codgers
who
were
friends
of
toby
and
he
supposed
that
his
own
father
never
saved
up
his
pennies
otherwise
his
old
tobacco
box
would
not
be
empty
every
now
and
then
however
he
was
glad
that
his
father
was
a
spendthrift
because
it
would
give
him
a
chance
to
go
to
the
old
tobacco
shop
sometimes
for
more
tobacco
for
the
box
and
apart
from
aunt
amanda
and
her
gingerbread
he
was
very
anxious
to
look
again
at
the
chinaman
head
in
which
lay
the
magic
tobacco
which
he
must
not
touch
one
thing
was
sure
he
would
never
go
without
looking
carefully
first
at
the
hands
of
the
clock
he
wished
he
knew
how
to
smoke
only
not
cigarettes
he
shivered
when
he
thought
of
the
terrible
consequences
when
he
came
to
the
track
the
was
going
past
at
least
it
was
coming
down
the
street
and
he
did
not
want
to
be
run
over
by
that
horse
he
had
better
wait
for
the
horse
was
trotting
his
mother
had
warned
him
about
it
he
sat
down
on
the
curb
he
had
quite
a
moment
or
two
to
wait
and
there
would
be
time
to
give
a
hasty
glance
at
the
gingerbread
he
laid
the
beside
him
on
the
curb
and
opened
the
other
package
the
had
dropped
into
a
walk
and
his
bell
was
hardly
jingling
there
was
no
hurry
after
all
it
would
never
do
to
cross
in
front
of
that
horse
even
though
he
was
walking
he
looked
at
the
gingerbread
it
was
fresh
and
soft
and
its
smell
when
held
close
to
the
nose
was
nothing
less
than
heavenly
it
was
a
pity
it
had
to
be
hidden
away
again
in
the
sack
but
the
horse
was
going
by
and
the
danger
would
soon
be
past
he
held
the
gingerbread
under
his
nose
merely
to
smell
it
the
edge
of
it
touched
his
upper
lip
by
chance
and
there
was
something
peculiar
about
the
feel
of
it
he
could
tell
exactly
what
it
was
very
interesting
he
touched
it
with
the
tip
of
his
tongue
to
see
if
it
felt
the
same
to
his
tongue
as
to
his
lip
it
was
just
the
same
perhaps
teeth
would
be
different
his
teeth
sank
into
it
just
for
a
trial
the
horse
was
going
by
now
and
the
driver
was
looking
at
him
he
forgot
what
he
was
about
in
watching
the
horse
and
his
driver
as
they
went
on
past
him
the
gingerbread
completely
slipped
his
mind
and
when
he
turned
his
head
back
from
the
and
came
to
himself
he
found
to
his
amazement
that
his
mouth
was
full
of
gingerbread
he
wondered
at
first
how
it
got
there
but
there
was
no
use
in
wondering
there
it
was
and
it
had
to
be
swallowed
his
mother
would
never
approve
of
his
spitting
it
out
and
so
to
please
his
mother
he
swallowed
it
the
was
nearly
a
square
away
he
could
cross
the
track
at
any
time
now
there
was
no
hurry
when
he
came
into
the
fine
brick
house
where
he
lived
with
only
one
package
in
his
hand
his
mother
threw
up
her
hands
and
said
why
freddie
where
on
earth
have
you
been
did
you
get
lost
are
you
hungry
no
yes
said
freddie
frederick
said
his
father
looking
at
him
with
that
look
where
have
you
been
did
i
tell
you
to
hurry
yes
sir
to
punch
and
i
did
see
his
farver
at
all
but
the
hands
come
right
over
on
top
of
each
other
and
he
did
get
down
off
of
his
perch
he
did
so
toby
took
me
in
to
see
aunt
namanda
and
she
eats
pins
and
it
cigarettes
that
gives
you
that
hump
on
the
back
only
tobacco
all
right
you
smoke
it
in
a
pipe
and
it
does
do
you
any
harm
at
all
and
that
what
toby
says
and
he
ought
to
know
he
got
one
on
his
back
his
own
self
but
you
must
touch
that
tobacco
in
the
head
it
magic
and
the
sailor
said
so
and
the
mitchner
and
that
all
you
will
notice
that
he
said
nothing
about
the
gingerbread
chapter
iii
introducing
the
churchwarden
every
time
freddie
visited
the
old
tobacco
shop
after
that
and
it
was
pretty
often
whether
the
tobacco
box
at
home
needed
tobacco
or
not
for
there
were
a
good
many
things
that
drew
him
there
and
he
hardly
knew
which
was
the
most
fascinating
there
was
always
a
chance
of
gingerbread
and
you
could
usually
depend
on
seeing
aunt
amanda
eat
pins
and
you
could
look
through
the
two
pieces
of
glass
at
the
double
picture
and
make
it
all
one
picture
with
the
people
in
it
standing
out
as
if
they
were
real
and
toby
would
often
sing
about
his
friends
the
two
old
codgers
and
talk
about
their
mean
ways
and
punch
was
always
waiting
for
his
father
outside
the
door
so
that
you
had
to
keep
your
eyes
on
the
time
or
at
least
the
clock
which
is
different
and
sometimes
toby
would
let
you
in
behind
the
counter
and
let
you
scoop
tobacco
into
a
paper
sack
and
when
his
back
was
turned
you
could
stand
under
the
chinaman
head
with
the
magic
tobacco
in
it
and
look
up
at
it
and
wonder
what
would
happen
if
you
took
just
one
or
two
little
teeny
whiffs
but
i
forget
what
i
started
to
tell
you
oh
yes
every
time
freddie
visited
the
old
tobacco
shop
toby
would
ask
him
his
name
in
order
to
see
if
he
was
grown
up
yet
what
your
name
today
toby
would
say
fweddie
would
be
the
little
boy
answer
not
yet
toby
would
say
shaking
his
head
sadly
you
ai
grown
up
yet
i
very
sorry
to
have
to
tell
you
son
but
you
got
to
wait
a
while
before
you
grown
up
i
tell
you
what
i
give
you
six
months
more
said
toby
on
one
occasion
if
you
ai
grown
up
by
that
time
there
no
hope
for
you
i
hate
to
have
to
say
it
but
you
might
as
well
know
it
one
time
as
another
and
the
very
next
time
the
little
boy
came
he
said
his
name
was
fweddie
and
toby
said
well
never
mind
you
got
five
months
and
days
left
and
there
hope
yet
i
suppose
you
would
want
to
be
a
little
boy
the
time
and
never
grow
up
at
all
would
you
freddie
looked
up
at
him
in
alarm
and
said
no
sir
then
said
toby
better
mind
your
p
and
q
freddie
wanted
to
ask
about
these
p
and
q
but
you
may
have
noticed
that
he
was
shy
and
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
do
so
he
knew
all
about
p
and
q
in
the
alphabet
book
at
home
but
he
did
not
know
how
to
mind
them
he
knew
how
to
mind
his
mother
sometimes
but
how
could
you
mind
letters
in
a
book
that
could
ever
say
do
do
that
like
mother
he
was
very
anxious
on
this
point
for
he
knew
that
his
time
was
growing
short
and
the
idea
of
never
growing
up
was
simply
terrifying
he
might
as
well
smoke
cigarettes
and
be
done
with
it
in
point
of
fact
he
now
had
only
about
a
week
left
and
he
was
grown
up
yet
but
one
morning
when
the
hands
of
the
church
clock
were
wide
apart
and
all
was
safe
he
passed
by
punch
and
opened
the
shop
door
toby
was
standing
behind
the
counter
tying
up
a
parcel
he
went
on
tying
it
up
and
said
all
right
young
feller
it
your
turn
next
this
here
package
is
for
the
sly
old
codger
and
he
be
back
for
it
pretty
soon
and
if
it
ai
ready
whew
wo
we
get
blown
up
though
now
then
what

o
maiden

the

freddie
said
the
little
boy
toby
dropped
his
package
and
leaned
across
the
counter
in
amazement
what
that
you
say
freddie
cried
the
little
boy
bursting
with
pride
well
bless
my
soul
if
i
ever
in
my
life
as
sure
as
the
world
strike
me
dead
if
he
did
say
it
as
plain
as
young
man
said
toby
solemnly
and
he
walked
to
the
end
of
the
counter
opened
the
swinging
gate
came
through
stood
in
front
of
freddie
and
shook
him
by
the
hand
young
man

almighty
close

said
freddie
opening
his
eyes
wide
am
i
grown
up
now
toby
stared
without
speaking
and
then
threw
out
both
his
arms
and
for
a
moment
it
looked
as
if
he
were
going
to
hug
the
little
boy
but
he
evidently
thought
better
of
it
are
you
why
of
course
you
are
ai
i
been
telling
you
but
you
go
and
presume
on
it
too
much
young
feller
you
do
think

can
go
and
smoke

freddie
earnestly
i

can
go
and
smoke
that
magic
tobacco
now
do
you
because
if
you
do
no
sir
said
freddie
but
he
said
this
a
little
doubtfully
and
he
looked
at
the
chinaman
head
with
more
interest
than
ever
what
was
the
use
of
being
grown
up
if
you
could
take
a
little
risk
now
and
then
all
right
then
cried
toby
we
got
to
have
a
little
celebration
over
this
here
event
and
we
better
go
in
and
see
aunt
amanda

right
now
he
grasped
freddie
hand
again
and
pulled
him
to
the
back
door
and
through
into
the
back
room
where
aunt
amanda
was
sitting
by
the
table
with
the
wax
flowers
sewing
quick

amanda

toby
freddie
said
the
little

very
distinctly
but
looking
down
at
the
carpet
for
fear
he
should
seem
proud

up
today
cried
toby
and
we
got
to
celebrate
aunt
amanda
raised
her
eyebrows
in
astonishment
and
said
esheeraybysart
she
put
her
hand
to
her
mouth
and
somehow
got
out
into
her
hand
a
good
mouthful
of
pins
she
laid
them
down
on
the
table
at
her
elbow
and
said
bless
the
dear
baby
heart
and
are
you
grown
up
now
yes
said
freddie
looking
up
and
then
down
again
for
he
did
not
wish
to
seem
too
proud
aunt
amanda
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
and
took
out
her
handkerchief
and
blew
her
nose
very
loud
toby
she
said
what
did
you
mean
by
a
celebration
tomorrow
saturday
said
he
well
what
of
it
freddie
could
not
understand
very
well
what
they
were
saying
after
that
except
that
he
was
concerned
in
it
somehow
until
he
heard
aunt
amanda
say
you
better
ask
his
mother

young
man
said
toby
if

write
a
letter

ma

said
freddie
whereupon
toby
sat
down
at
the
other
side
of
the
table
with
pen
and
paper
and
ink
and
commenced
to
write
first

cried
toby
jumping
up
and
going
out
into
the
kitchen
freddie
ate
the
sitting
on
a
hassock
at
aunt
amanda
feet
while
toby
went
on
with
his
letter
but
in
the
midst
of
it
toby
went
out
again
and
finally
came
back
with
a
tall
glass
of
lemonade
do
you
go
and
spill
it
on
the
carpet
said
he
as
he
sat
down
to
his
writing
no
sir
said
freddie
aunt
amanda
looked
at
him
as
he
sat
so
seriously
on
his
hassock
at
her
feet
munching
his
and
sipping
his
lemonade
and
she
pulled
out
her
and
blew
her
nose
again
very
loud
she
appeared
to
have
a
cold
toby
paid
no
attention
to
her
his
head
was
lying
sidewise
on
his
left
arm
on
the
table
and
he
was
squinting
at
the
sheet
of
paper
and
every
time
his
pen
came
down
he
closed
his
mouth
tight
and
every
time
his
pen
went
up
he
opened
his
mouth
wide
freddie
and
aunt
amanda
had
plenty
of
time
to
talk
under
the
softening
influence
of
and
lemonade
freddie
found
his
tongue
what
a
churchwarden
he
said
suddenly
into
the
which
was
just
under
his
nose
bless
the
baby
said
aunt
amanda
it
a
long
clay
pipe
young
man
said
toby
chewing
the
end
of
his
like
you
seen
in
the
case
out
there
in
the
shop
that
ai
what
he
means
said
aunt
amanda
you
mean
a
man
you
freddie
yes
said
freddie
looking
at
the
cake
just
going
into
his
mouth
it
a
man
said
aunt
amanda
it
a
man
that
belongs
to
a
church
and
he
stands
guard
over
the
church
property
and
sees
to
the
repairs
and
beats
little
boys
with
a
cane
when
they
make
a
noise
during
service
and
takes
care
nobody
do
run
away
with
the
collection
money
and
how
do
you
spell
said
toby
scratching
his
head
with
the
pen
yours
respectfully
began
aunt
amanda
no
that
ai
right
there
one
over
at
that
church
said
freddie
pointing
towards
the
window
and
he
smokes
one
too
one
what
freddie
said
aunt
amanda
a
churchwarden
there
a
churchwarden
sits
out
on
the
pavement
and
he
smokes
a
churchwarden
he
does
freddie
was
rather
proud
that
he
had
mastered
that
difficult
word
and
he
liked
to
hear
himself
say
it
oh
said
toby
i
reckon
he
means
the
sextant
over
there
well
respectfully
i
do
give
a
hum
how
you
spell
it
there
she
goes
done
respectfully
toby
littleback
it
blotted
up
some
by
crackey
that
a
fact
but
i
ai
to
write
all
that
over
again
not
by
a
jugful
and
he
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
he
a
churchwarden
insisted
freddie
swallowing
the
last
of
the
lemonade
after
the
last
of
the
cake
all
right
said
toby
have
it
your
own
way
but
a
sextant
as
good
as
a
churchwarden
in
opinion
any
day
of
the
week
except
sunday
of
course
aunt
amanda
inspected
the
letter
and
declared
herself
horrified
by
the
blots
but
toby
positively
refused
to
go
through
that
exhausting
labor
again
so
she
passed
it
grudgingly
and
handed
it
to
freddie
in
an
envelope
and
told
him
to
give
it
to
his
mother
as
soon
as
he
got
home
do
you
want
some
more
cake
and
lemonade
said
she
yes
said
he
well
you
wo
get
it
so
trot
along
home
in
the
shop
toby
showed
him
the
churchwarden
pipes
in
the
freddie
wondered
how
it
would
taste
to
smoke
some
of
that
magic
tobacco
in
the
chinaman
head
in
a
churchwarden
pipe
as
he
passed
the
church
on
his
way
home
he
looked
for
the
fat
old
man
who
usually
sat
in
his
chair
tilted
back
against
the
wall
but
he
was
not
there
freddie
wished
to
ask
him
about
those
noises
up
in
the
tower
when
punch
and
his
father
were
having
their
high
jinks
he
had
never
been
able
to
screw
up
his
courage
to
the
point
of
asking
about
this
but
now
that
he
was
grown
up
he
thought
he
might
be
able
he
gave
the
letter
to
his
mother
and
she
read
it
but
she
said
nothing
to
him
about
it
when
his
father
came
home
in
the
evening
she
showed
the
letter
to
him
and
they
talked
about
it
and
freddie
could
not
understand
very
well
what
they
were
saying
finally
his
father
said
well
i
do
think
there
would
be
any
harm
in
it
i
suppose
not
said
his
mother
i
see
them
in
the
morning
he
had
better
wear
his
sunday
suit
and
his
new
shoes
this
was
bad
because
it
sounded
like
and
the
shoes
squeaked
freddie
thought
he
had
better
change
the
subject
so
he
said
i
grown
up
i
can
say
freddie
toby
says
so
his
father
laughed
but
his
mother
took
him
up
in
her
arms
and
hugged
him
close
to
her
breast
the
next
day
was
in
fact
saturday
and
after
lunch
freddie
mother
helped
him
or
rather
forced
him
into
his
sunday
suit
and
his
new
shoes
after
a
really
outrageous
piece
of
washing
which
went
not
only
behind
the
ears
but
actually
into
them
she
put
his
cap
on
his
head
he
always
had
to
move
it
a
trifle
afterwards
looked
at
his
again
pulled
down
his
jacket
in
front
and
buttoned
every
button
straightened
out
each
of
the
four
wings
of
his
bow
tie
took
off
his
cap
to
see
if
his
hair
was
mussed
and
put
it
on
again
pulled
down
his
jacket
in
front
straightened
his
tie
altered
the
position
of
his
cap
put
both
her
arms
around
him
and
kissed
him
and
told
him
it
was
nearly
two
and
he
had
better
hurry
as
soon
as
she
had
gone
in
after
watching
him
go
off
down
the
street
he
unbuttoned
every
button
of
his
jacket
put
his
cap
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
in
crossing
the
track
deliberately
walked
his
shiny
squeaking
shoes
into
a
pile
of
he
then
felt
better
and
went
on
towards
the
old
tobacco
shop
as
he
came
to
the
church
he
stopped
to
look
at
the
hands
of
the
clock
he
was
in
luck
the
hands
would
not
be
together
for
ever
so
long
for
it
was
ten
minutes
to
two
the
churchwarden
was
sitting
in
his
chair
tilted
back
against
the
wall
keeping
guard
over
his
church
and
he
was
smoking
his
churchwarden
pipe
freddie
walked
by
very
slowly
and
his
shoes
squeaked
aloud
on
the
brick
pavement
the
fat
old
man
gazed
at
him
solemnly
and
freddie
looked
at
the
fat
old
man
the
chair
came
down
on
the
pavement
with
a
thump
look
here
he
said
this
ai
sunday
what
the
meaning
of
all
this
it
against
the
rules
to
wear
them
squeaking
shoes
of
a
saturday
the
dean
and
chapter
has
made
that
rule
by
and
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
city
council
do
you
know
that
and
all
that
big
red
necktie
too
did
you
think
it
was
sunday
no
sir
said
freddie
for
he
was
always
honest
even
in
the
face
of
danger
i
could
help
it
i
did
want
to
but
mother
made
me
ah
that
it
i
thought
maybe
you
made
a
mistake
in
the
day
then
it
would
been
so
bad
look
here
it
my
duty
to
report
this
here
violation
of
the
sunday
law
but
as
long
as
you
sure
you
no
sir
said
the
little
boy
earnestly
my
name
freddie
well
that
makes
it
different
i
though
you
was
another
party
young
but
if
you
ai
why
here
you
need
something
to
show
in
case
you
should
meet
the
archdeacon
and
he
want
to
know
why
i
had
reported
you
show
him
this
and
he
know
it
all
right
the
fat
churchwarden
fished
in
his
vest
pocket
and
drew
out
between
a
fat
thumb
and
a
fat
forefinger
a
round
shining
piece
of
metal
and
put
it
in
freddie
hand
freddie
saw
that
it
was
a
bright
new
piece
commonly
called
a
nickel
he
felt
better
if
you
do
meet
the
archdeacon
between
here
and
littleback
tobacco
shop
went
on
the
churchwarden
you
do
need
to
keep
it
any
longer
i
do
care
what
you
do
with
it
then
only
not
pickles
mind
you
no
sir
said
freddie
this
was
his
chance
to
inquire
about
punch
father
and
the
noises
in
the
tower
but
it
was
out
of
his
power
to
stay
longer
he
was
too
glad
to
escape
without
being
reported
and
he
accordingly
went
off
down
the
street
squeaking
worse
than
ever
and
positively
hurrying
chapter
iv
in
which
hanlon
makes
a
great
impression
freddie
found
no
one
in
the
tobacco
shop
so
he
knocked
on
the
door
of
the
back
room
and
it
was
instantly
opened
by
littleback
himself
but
a
littleback
so
resplendent
that
freddie
hardly
knew
him
the
suit
of
clothes
which
littleback
wore
was
beyond
any
doubt
a
brand
new
suit
the
ground
color
of
it
was
a
rich
mauve
if
you
know
what
that
is
not
exactly
purple
nor
violet
but
somewhere
in
between
and
up
and
down
and
across
were
stripes
of
brown
making
squares
all
over
him
it
was
extremely
beautiful
his
collar
was
a
high
white
collar
very
stiff
and
it
held
up
his
chin
in
front
like
a
whitewashed
fence
his
necktie
was
of
a
satin
with
little
pink
roses
painted
on
it
yes
sir
painted
mind
you
by
hand
it
was
not
one
of
those
troublesome
things
that
come
in
a
single
long
piece
and
take
you
hours
before
the
glass
to
twist
and
turn
over
and
under
before
you
can
get
them
to
look
like
a
necktie
no
indeed
it
was
far
better
than
that
it
was
tied
already
by
somebody
who
could
do
it
better
than
you
ever
could
and
when
you
bought
it
all
you
had
to
do
was
to
put
it
on
fasten
those
two
rubber
bands
behind
with
a
hook
and
there
you
were
perfect
as
to
hair
the
hand
of
the
barber
was
yet
upon
him
his
hair
parted
on
one
side
was
of
a
slickness
which
his
own
soap
never
could
have
accomplished
on
the
wide
side
it
lay
flat
down
over
his
forehead
and
there
gave
a
sudden
curl
backward
like
the
curve
of
a
hairpin
but
much
more
graceful
it
is
only
the
most
studious
barbers
who
ever
learn
to
do
it
just
right
there
were
creases
down
the
arms
of
toby
coat
and
down
the
front
of
his
a
yellow
silk
handkerchief
showed
itself
not
boldly
but
quietly
from
his
breast
pocket
as
he
let
freddie
in
and
in
doing
so
turned
his
back
to
aunt
amanda
she
screamed
and
cried
out
toby
look
behind
you
merciful
heavens
freddie
in
the
midst
of
his
admiration
of
the
magnificent
creature
saw
him
whirl
about
and
look
behind
himself
in
alarm
his
aunt
pointed
at
his
coat
and
said
sternly
come
here
freddie
saw
on
the
back
of
toby
coat
near
the
bottom
as
he
whirled
about
a
little
square
white
tag
toby
backed
up
to
his
aunt
and
stood
before
her
trying
to
look
at
his
back
over
his
shoulder
while
she
took
her
scissors
and
clipped
the
threads
by
which
the
white
tag
was
sewed
to
the
back
of
his
coat
she
held
up
the
tag
it
had
numbers
printed
and
written
on
it
now
ai
that
just
like
you
toby
littleback
she
said
going
out
with
your
tag
on
your
back
with
your
size
on
it
and
your
height
and
age
too
for
all
i
know
for
anybody
to
see
that
you
got
on
a
splittin
brand
new
suit
right
out
o
the
shop
if
you
gone
out
with
that
on
your
back
i
died
with
shame
right
here
in
this
chair
ai
you
even
able
to
dress
yourself
by
crickets
that
been
bad
said
toby
considerably
upset
however
you
caught
it
in
time
so

cryin
over
it
aunt

or

to

a

said
aunt
amanda
i
declare
the
so
excited
he
do
know
what
he
doing
blamed
if
i
did
come
near
going
without
a
hat
said
toby
here
she
is
he
produced
his
hat
from
a
cupboard
in
the
room
and
put
it
on
it
would
have
been
a
pity
indeed
for
him
to
have
gone
without
it
it
was
a
white
derby
yes
a
derby
it
was
the
kind
of
a
hat
which
was
known
in
that
city
as
a
pinochle
pronounced
by
all
boys
with
the
mauve
suit
and
the
necktie
and
the
whitewashed
fence
the
white
derby
set
him
off
to
perfection
especially
as
he
wore
it
a
little
towards
the
back
of
his
head
so
as
to
show
the
loveliest
part
of
the
plastered
curl
of
his
hair
on
the
forehead
aunt
amanda
could
not
restrain
her
admiration
you
do
now
she
said
i
do
know
that
i
ever
seen
you
look
so
genteel
before
toby
in
the
embarrassment
of
being
considered
genteel
put
his
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
take
them
hands
out
of
your
pockets
said
aunt
amanda
sharply
and
he
took
them
out
in
a
hurry
now
freddie
she
said
come
here
a
minute
and
i
set
you
to
rights
freddie
stood
before
her
knee
not
very
willingly
and
she
buttoned
his
jacket
from
top
to
bottom
and
put
his
cap
squarely
on
his
head
now
you
better
be
off
she
said
aunt
and
i
wish
you
were
going
too
said
toby
his
hand
on
the
freddie
said
she
said
freddie
what
said
she
aunt
amanda
said
he
when
they
were
out
in
the
street
and
she
heard
toby
lock
the
shop
door
behind
him
she
took
out
her
handkerchief
and
blew
her
nose
her
cold
was
evidently
worse
because
she
blew
her
nose
several
times
and
then
tucking
her
handkerchief
away
in
her
dress
she
put
her
head
down
on
her
arm
on
the
table
and
cried
the
first
thing
freddie
did
as
they
went
up
the
street
was
to
put
his
cap
back
again
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
the
next
thing
he
did
was
to
unbutton
every
button
of
his
jacket
from
top
to
bottom
the
little
hunchback
was
in
a
great
hurry
and
he
dragged
the
little
boy
along
by
the
hand
so
fast
that
he
could
hardly
keep
up
as
they
hurried
along
several
naughty
boys
observing
toby
white
derby
hat
called
after
him
very
rudely
but
toby
paid
no
attention
and
dragged
freddie
along
faster
than
ever
we
do
want
to
miss
any
of
it
said
toby
hurry
up
boy
they
did
not
have
far
to
go
only
four
or
five
squares
they
stopped
before
a
great
grimy
brick
building
with
a
great
wide
here
we
are
said
toby
what
does
that
say
up
there
said
freddie
gaunt
street
theatre
said
toby
hurry
up
freddie
hung
back
before
a
signboard
on
which
was
a
picture
of
a
slender
man
dressed
up
in
white
clothing
very
tight
with
red
and
black
squares
on
it
he
was
leaning
against
a
table
his
head
and
face
were
a
dead
white
except
for
red
eyebrows
and
a
red
spot
in
each
cheek
and
he
had
no
hair
but
a
smooth
skin
from
his
forehead
to
the
back
of
his
neck
the
peculiar
thing
was
that
his
head
was
on
the
table
beside
him
and
not
on
his
neck
freddie
pointed
to
the
writing
underneath
the
picture
and
said
what
does
that
say
hanlon
superba
said
toby
pulling
him
along
hurry
up
we
be
late
littleback
went
to
a
little
window
in
the
wall
inside
the
and
spoke
to
a
man
in
there
and
evidently
asked
permission
to
go
in
and
evidently
got
it
and
they
did
go
in
up
a
flight
of
stairs
and
found
themselves
suddenly
among
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
as
it
seemed
all
sitting
in
chairs
facing
the
same
way
in
a
vast
house
lit
up
by
gas
light
so
that
it
was
almost
as
bright
as
day
and
toby
and
freddie
sat
down
in
the
very
front
row
of
these
people
and
looked
down
over
a
railing
in
front
of
them
on
the
heads
of
thousands
and
thousands
as
it
seemed
of
other
people
all
sitting
in
chairs
facing
the
same
way
everybody
was
facing
towards
a
straight
wall
at
the
other
side
of
the
house
which
had
pictures
painted
on
it
at
the
foot
of
this
wall
in
a
kind
of
trench
there
was
a
man
at
a
piano
and
there
were
other
men
with
fiddles
big
and
little
and
still
others
with
brass
things
and
they
were
all
playing
a
tremendous
tune
together
but
just
after
toby
and
freddie
had
sat
down
they
stopped
playing
and
toby
nudged
freddie
with
his
elbow
and
said
now
then
young
feller
what
do
you
think
of
this
eh
just
you
wait
keep
your
eye
on
that
curtain
he
had
no
sooner
said
this
than
somewhere
in
the
house
somebody
gave
a
piercing
whistle
between
his
fingers
and
in
a
minute
there
was
such
a
racket
that
it
was
impossible
to
talk
there
must
have
been
people
above
them
and
they
must
certainly
have
all
been
boys
for
from
up
there
freddie
heard
a
clapping
of
hands
and
a
stamping
of
feet
all
in
a
regular
time
which
spread
to
the
whole
house
and
in
the
midst
of
it
the
boys
up
there
began
to
shout
and
call
and
whistle
and
in
a
few
minutes
there
was
such
a
hubbub
as
only
boys
could
make
with
whistling
between
the
fingers
leading
the
riot
toby
nudged
freddie
again
with
his
elbow
and
to
freddie
surprise
began
to
clap
his
hands
and
stamp
his
feet
with
the
rest
and
as
freddie
thought
he
ought
to
be
polite
he
clapped
his
hands
too
though
he
did
not
know
very
well
what
it
was
all
about
suddenly
the
men
in
the
trench
at
the
foot
of
the
painted
wall
struck
up
again
and
that
quieted
the
other
noise
for
a
moment
but
only
for
a
moment
someone
whistled
through
his
fingers
and
in
an
instant
those
fiddlers
might
as
well
have
been
sawing
away
at
their
fiddles
out
at
the
park
for
all
you
could
hear
them
and
right
in
the
midst
of
it
all
while
freddie
was
trying
to
shout
the
word
peanuts
into
toby
ear
suddenly
the
lights
went
out
and
you
could
have
heard
a
pin
drop
now
then
now
then
whispered
toby
in
great
excitement
now
you
see
watch
the
curtain
it
going
up
from
down
there
in
that
dark
trench
came
the
sound
of
a
soft
twittery
kind
of
music
and
at
the
same
time
the
painted
wall
that
freddie
had
been
looking
at
was
rising
going
up
and
it
went
on
up
and
up
out
of
sight
into
the
ceiling
and
there
behind
it
in
a
dim
light
there
behind
it
mysterious
and
fearsome
and
delicious
well
there
behind
it
was
fairyland
just
fairyland
i
ca
describe
it
to
you
freddie
never
forgot
it
if
you
have
seen
hanlon
superba
in
some
old
gaunt
street
theatre
or
other
on
a
saturday
afternoon
with
the
galleries
wild
with
boys
you
have
not
lived
when
freddie
tried
to
tell
his
mother
and
his
father
about
it
that
night
it
was
such
a
whirling
mass
of
wonders
and
glories
that
they
could
not
make
head
nor
tail
of
it
it
is
useless
to
speak
of
the
fairy
queen
in
her
glittering
white
coming
to
the
rescue
in
the
nick
of
time
with
her
diamond
sceptre
or
of
the
horrible
demons
or
the
trouble
and
excitement
they
made
for
everybody
or
of
the
beautiful
young
lady
who
and
such
leapings
and
twistings
and
climbings
and
tumblings
as
no
mere
human
beings
with
bones
in
them
could
ever
have
performed
it
is
no
use
it
is
best
not
to
try
to
describe
it
but
there
was
one
part
which
although
it
may
seem
to
you
the
most
unlikely
thing
in
the
world
really
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
freddie
afterwards
there
was
the
same
man
whose
picture
he
had
seen
outside
on
the
signboard
and
he
could
climb
straight
walls
and
leap
through
high
windows
and
tumble
across
floors
in
a
way
which
passed
belief
but
there
was
one
thing
he
could
not
do
he
could
not
talk
he
never
spoke
a
word
from
beginning
to
end
once
after
having
escaped
from
a
parcel
of
wicked
red
imps
he
sat
down
tired
out
and
starved
to
death
before
a
table
loaded
with
food
and
he
commenced
to
make
a
hearty
meal
but
just
as
he
was
about
to
sample
each
plate
it
disappeared
vanished
completely
out
of
sight
right
under
his
nose
his
distress
was
pitiable
and
freddie
thought
it
cruel
of
everybody
to
laugh
as
everybody
did
on
his
plate
were
sausages
and
he
nearly
got
them
but
just
as
he
thought
he
had
them
they
actually
jumped
off
the
table
and
ran
along
the
floor
and
up
the
wall
and
the
poor
man
had
to
climb
the
wall
after
them
which
he
did
like
a
cat
and
even
then
he
never
came
up
with
them
he
was
terribly
disappointed
and
to
finish
off
his
miseries
at
last
a
wicked
creature
with
a
sword
came
up
behind
him
as
he
was
leaning
his
head
down
on
the
table
in
despair
and
cut
off
his
head
before
your
very
eyes
really
and
truly
cut
it
off
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
the
head
was
on
the
table
and
the
poor
man
was
in
the
chair
freddie
was
terrified
and
clutched
toby
arm
but
when
the
wicked
murderer
had
gone
away
back
popped
the
head
onto
the
dead
man
neck
his
eyes
opened
he
grinned
from
ear
to
ear
and
there
he
was
on
his
feet
skipping
and
tumbling
as
lively
as
ever
and
at
that
freddie
and
all
the
others
in
the
house
roared
and
shouted
and
clapped
their
hands
is
that
mr
hanlon
whispered
freddie
into
toby
ear
reckon
it
is
said
toby
too
excited
himself
to
pay
much
attention
to
freddie
but
it
could
not
last
forever
even
the
peanuts
which
toby
bought
for
freddie
between
the
first
and
second
acts
were
all
gone
and
the
curtain
was
down
for
the
last
time
and
the
crowd
crushed
through
the
doors
and
toby
put
on
his
white
derby
hat
they
were
in
the
street
and
the
speechless
hanlon
was
a
thing
of
the
past
freddie
did
not
believe
that
he
would
ever
see
that
dumb
and
man
again
but
in
that
he
was
mistaken
as
you
shall
see
toby
left
him
at
the
corner
near
his
father
house
what
i
say
is
said
toby
three
cheers
for
our
party
yes
said
freddie
and
three
cheers
for
mr
hanlon
chapter
v
the
chinaman
head
for
a
long
time
afterwards
freddie
dreamed
at
night
of
a
hunchbacked
man
whose
head
came
off
and
popped
on
again
and
wicked
red
demons
who
chased
a
poor
man
with
a
white
face
who
tried
to
cry
for
help
and
could
not
speak
a
word
and
of
a
chinaman
head
without
a
body
smoking
a
long
clay
pipe
in
the
daytime
he
thought
a
good
deal
about
the
people
he
was
now
acquainted
with
toby
with
his
white
derby
hat
aunt
amanda
swallowing
pins
the
sailorman
from
china
punch
and
his
father
hanlon
with
his
head
on
the
table
the
churchwarden
smoking
his
churchwarden
pipe
and
the
two
old
codgers
one
so
sly
and
the
other
so
beggarly
but
that
which
occupied
his
mind
more
than
anything
else
was
the
chinaman
head
on
toby
shelf
freddie
was
older
now
and
as
time
went
on
it
might
be
thought
that
he
would
have
grown
accustomed
to
all
these
strange
things
but
he
had
not
far
from
it
he
thought
about
them
more
and
more
and
most
of
all
about
the
chinaman
head
and
the
magic
tobacco
he
really
could
not
get
that
chinaman
head
out
of
his
mind
here
was
magic
just
within
reach
of
your
hand
and
you
were
told
that
you
must
touch
it
you
might
as
well
have
aladdin
lamp
in
your
bureau
drawer
and
be
told
to
keep
away
from
the
bureau
even
parents
ought
to
know
better
than
to
expect
such
a
thing
anyway
what
harm
could
just
one
or
two
little
whiffs
do
you
need
smoke
a
whole
pipeful
if
you
did
want
to
however
toby
would
not
be
pleased
and
freddie
did
not
intend
to
do
anything
to
displease
toby
still
it
did
seem
a
pity
with
such
a
chance
right
over
your
head
oh
well
he
would
think
no
more
about
it
he
fixed
his
mind
on
other
things
he
thought
especially
about
a
hymn
they
sang
nearly
every
sunday
in
it
was
a
great
help
he
knew
it
by
heart
and
it
went
like
this
yield
not
to
temptation
for
yielding
is
sin
each
will
help
you
some
other
to
win
he
resolved
he
would
never
think
about
the
magic
tobacco
again
he
went
to
sleep
saying
over
to
himself
yield
not
to
temptation
and
dreamed
all
night
about
the
chinaman
head
and
thought
about
it
all
the
next
day
in
order
to
get
it
out
of
his
mind
he
called
on
aunt
amanda
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
he
sat
on
his
hassock
and
watched
aunt
amanda
sewing
toby
was
in
the
shop
waiting
on
customers
freddie
watched
for
a
long
time
and
then
said
what
are
you
doing
basting
said
aunt
amanda
i
thought
that
was
what
you
did
to
a
turkey
said
freddie
so
it
is
said
aunt
amanda
that
is
a
turkey
said
freddie
no
said
aunt
amanda
you
baste
a
turkey
with
gravy
that
is
gravy
said
freddie
it
different
said
aunt
amanda
you
see
i
have
to
sew
this
up
with
needle
and
thread
and
you
sew
up
a
turkey
with
needle
and
thread
too
said
freddie
but
that
different
said
aunt
amanda
you
could
baste
a
turkey
with
needle
and
thread
and
you
could
baste
with
gravy
why
not
said
freddie
well
said
aunt
amanda
well
you
see
they
do
do
it
that
way
it
it
ai
the
same
thing
at
all
it
like
this
when
you
baste
a
turkey
have
you
ever
had
any
children
said
freddie
aunt
amanda
put
her
hand
to
her
heart
suddenly
as
if
she
had
received
a
shot
there
and
caught
her
breath
then
she
looked
out
of
the
window
and
then
round
at
the
wax
flowers
on
the
table
and
then
at
the
door
and
she
really
seemed
to
be
thinking
of
running
away
but
she
was
too
lame
to
do
that
and
she
at
last
clasped
her
fingers
together
tight
in
her
lap
and
looked
hard
at
freddie
he
was
gazing
at
her
calmly
waiting
for
information
no
said
aunt
amanda
i
have
never
had
any
children
why
not
said
freddie
i
have
never
been
married
said
aunt
amanda
freddie
thought
about
this
for
a
moment
did
anybody
ever
want
you
said
he
no
said
she
nobody
ever
wanted
me
freddie
was
puzzled
but
you
nice
said
he
that
ai
enough
said
aunt
amanda
what
else
do
you
have
to
be
you
have
to
be
pretty
were
you
ever
pretty
i
thought
so
once
but
but
i
must
have
been
mistaken
i
guess
i
never
was
freddie
thought
it
over
and
announced
his
decision
seriously
would
want
you
anyway
aunt
amanda
stretched
out
a
trembling
hand
to
him
and
ran
her
fingers
through
his
hair
then
she
threw
both
her
arms
around
him
and
pressed
him
against
her
knee
he
was
much
annoyed
he
was
afraid
she
might
be
going
to
kiss
him
but
she
did
not
instead
she
pulled
out
her
handkerchief
and
blew
her
nose
how
many
children
were
there
that
you
did
have
said
freddie
to
change
the
subject
aunt
amanda
did
not
understand
this
at
first
but
she
finally
saw
what
he
meant
what
he
mean
you
may
say
what
he
meant
was
well
it
is
perfectly
clear
but
it
is
hard
to
explain
anyway
aunt
amanda
understood
him
three
said
she
bobby
was
the
oldest
and
jenny
next
and
james
was
the
littlest
one
did
they
all
go
to
school
oh
dear
no
only
bobby
and
once
he
played
hookey
and
was
gone
all
day
and
did
come
home
until
after
dark
all
muddy
i
was
terribly
worried
he
was
a
very
mischievous
boy
but
he
was
his
mother
own
did
he
play
marbles
for
keeps
yes
but
he
went
to
just
as
regular
and
liked
it
and
he
it
yes
of
course
and
he
always
took
good
care
of
jenny
she
had
little
yellow
curls
they
went
to
together
hand
in
hand
and
he
did
even
mind
her
carrying
her
dolly
with
her
she
would
go
without
it
he
was
so
careful
of
her
at
she
loved
her
dollies
she
used
to
pretend
that
james
was
one
of
them
did
james
like
that
not
very
well
but
he
put
up
with
it
for
quite
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
he
could
be
still
very
long
but
he
was
pretty
lonesome
when
jenny
had
the
measles
i
had
the
did
bobby
know
how
to
mind
his
p
and
q
he
did
mind
anybody
very
well
once
i
had
a
note
from
his
teacher
and
it
said
but
freddie
never
learned
what
sin
bobby
had
committed
in
school
for
at
that
moment
the
shop
door
opened
and
toby
thrust
in
his
head
and
said
just
got
to
get
around
to
the
right
away
this
minute
put
it
off
no
longer
wo
be
gone
twenty
minutes
freddie
yes
sir
said
freddie
standing
up
do
you
think
you
could
look
after
the
shop
for
twenty
minutes
while
i
gone
now
freddie
did
not
know
it
but
this
was
in
fact
the
most
important
question
that
had
ever
been
put
to
him
in
his
life
everything
depended
on
his
answer
if
he
said
no
we
might
as
well
stop
this
story
right
here
if
he
said
yes
yes
sir
said
freddie
all
right
if
anybody
comes
in
just
tell
to
wait
freddie
left
aunt
amanda
sitting
very
still
and
gazing
out
of
the
window
with
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
and
followed
toby
into
the
shop
all
right
sonny
said
toby
make
yourself
comfortable
i
be
back
in
a
jiffy
if
anybody
comes
in
you
tell
to
wait
and
with
that
he
went
out
of
the
door
and
up
the
street
freddie
was
left
alone
in
the
shop
everything
was
very
quiet
now
for
it
was
beginning
to
be
twilight
and
all
the
people
seemed
to
be
indoors
he
knew
he
ought
to
be
going
home
but
he
had
promised
to
mind
the
shop
and
it
would
never
do
to
leave
before
toby
came
back
the
street
door
and
the
door
to
aunt
room
were
both
closed
he
sat
down
on
the
chair
by
the
front
window
and
looked
out
across
the
head
he
thought
of
bobby
and
his
little
sister
in
and
that
led
him
to
think
of
the
hymn
that
did
him
so
much
good
yield
not
to
temptation
for
yielding
is
sin
he
sang
that
tune
to
himself
for
a
while
and
he
found
himself
singing
other
tunes
and
finally
one
which
began
there
was
an
old
codger
and
he
had
a
wooden
leg
and
he
never
bought
tobacco
when
tobacco
he
could
beg
tobacco
there
was
a
world
of
tobacco
on
those
shelves
smoking
tobacco
and
churchwarden
pipes
he
strolled
around
behind
the
counter
and
let
down
the
back
of
the
there
were
the
churchwarden
pipes
he
selected
one
and
took
it
out
it
tasted
cold
and
clammy
when
he
put
it
in
his
mouth
and
he
wondered
what
it
would
taste
like
with
tobacco
in
it
he
brought
the
little
ladder
and
got
up
on
it
facing
the
shelves
and
to
his
surprise
he
found
himself
looking
directly
into
the
slanting
eyes
of
the
porcelain
chinaman
head
he
stood
there
gazing
thoughtfully
into
those
eyes
and
singing
to
himself
the
verse
which
was
always
such
a
help
to
him
yield
not
to
temptation
for
yielding
is
sin
each
will
help
you
some
other
to
win
it
was
growing
a
little
darker
now
and
he
could
not
examine
the
chinaman
head
very
well
without
bringing
it
closer
he
took
the
head
in
his
hands
lifted
it
from
the
shelf
got
down
off
the
ladder
and
sat
down
on
the
floor
with
his
back
against
the
counter
and
while
he
was
doing
this
he
hummed
to
himself
the
next
part
of
his
tune
fight
manfully
onward
dark
passions
subdue
he
put
the
head
on
his
knees
and
took
off
the
chinaman
little
round
cap
which
proved
to
be
in
fact
a
lid
he
put
his
hand
inside
and
drew
out
a
good
fistful
of
absolutely
black
tobacco
fine
and
powdery
like
he
held
it
to
his
nose
and
it
smelt
very
sweet
in
fact
much
like
brown
sugar
he
wondered
if
it
would
taste
like
brown
sugar
through
the
and
humming
quietly
to
himself
each
will
help
you
he
poured
the
tobacco
into
the
bowl
of
the
pipe
he
was
disappointed
on
sucking
in
through
the
to
find
that
there
was
no
taste
at
all
of
course
the
only
way
to
give
tobacco
any
taste
was
to
light
it
he
reached
up
and
got
a
match
off
the
counter
behind
him
and
sitting
down
again
struck
the
match
on
the
floor
it
made
a
very
pretty
glow
in
the
twilight
and
he
watched
it
as
it
burned
away
in
his
fingers
it
would
be
burnt
out
in
another
second
so
humming
to
himself
those
words
yield
not
to
temptation
he
put
the
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
touched
the
lighted
match
to
the
tobacco
it
is
painful
to
have
to
tell
these
things
but
it
ca
be
helped
for
the
consequences
were
so
strange
and
so
important
to
freddie
and
his
friends
that
anyway
he
lit
the
pipe
and
drew
in
a
long
breath
through
the
stem
he
nearly
choked
to
death
smoke
got
into
his
nose
and
his
eyes
and
his
throat
and
he
coughed
and
coughed
but
he
remembered
the
words
fight
manfully
onward
and
he
determined
that
he
would
not
give
up
so
soon
he
stopped
coughing
and
pulled
again
at
the
pipe
this
time
he
did
not
swallow
the
smoke
but
blew
it
out
of
his
mouth
as
he
had
seen
it
done
a
thousand
times
he
gave
another
pull
and
blew
the
smoke
out
again
it
did
indeed
taste
like
brown
sugar
it
was
extremely
pleasant
he
puffed
again
and
again
he
was
astonished
that
he
could
have
produced
so
much
smoke
in
a
few
whiffs
there
was
quite
a
cloud
over
his
head
he
gave
another
puff
and
when
he
blew
out
the
smoke
the
white
cloud
above
him
was
so
thick
that
he
could
not
see
through
it
it
began
to
settle
down
on
him
he
put
the
chinaman
head
on
the
floor
and
looked
up
into
this
cloud
it
was
growing
thicker
and
thicker
and
it
was
beginning
to
churn
about
as
if
in
a
whirlwind
it
turned
all
sorts
of
colours
mostly
yellow
and
green
and
parts
of
it
looked
like
barber
poles
revolving
at
a
terrific
speed
he
became
dizzy
as
he
gazed
at
it
his
head
began
to
swim
the
cloud
was
coming
down
closer
and
closer
upon
him
and
whirling
about
more
and
more
wildly
he
crouched
down
lower
and
became
dizzier
and
dizzier
the
counter
and
the
shelves
began
to
go
round
and
round
so
that
he
had
to
put
his
hand
on
the
floor
to
steady
himself
in
another
moment
the
shop
disappeared
altogether
and
there
was
nothing
under
him
but
a
little
square
of
floor
and
nothing
over
him
but
the
wild
churning
cloud
now
sparkling
with
jets
of
fire
he
felt
himself
falling
falling
and
as
he
came
to
the
bottom
with
a
crash
he
heard
the
shop
door
open
and
close
and
found
himself
sitting
on
the
floor
with
his
back
to
the
counter
as
before
with
no
smoke
anywhere
to
be
seen
and
he
was
aware
that
a
hoarse
voice
was
speaking
on
the
other
side
of
the
counter
and
it
was
saying
these
words
very
loud
and
brisk
avast
there
belay
that
piping

freddie
put
the
pipe
down
on
the
floor
rose
to
his
feet
and
looked
over
the
counter
leaning
on
his
elbow
on
the
other
side
of
the
counter
was
a
sailorman
with
a
wide
blue
collar
open
at
the
throat
a
flat
blue
cap
with
a
black
ribbon
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
a
green
patch
over
his
right
eye
chapter
vi
lemuel
mizzen
freddie
looked
at
the
sailorman
and
the
sailorman
straightened
up
and
touched
his
cap
his
face
was
brown
as
weathered
oak
and
creased
like
bark
his
one
eye
was
black
and
glittering
the
hand
which
he
raised
to
his
cap
was
of
the
shape
and
nearly
the
size
of
a
ham
and
the
chest
and
throat
which
emerged
from
his
was
as
brown
as
his
face
and
big
with
muscles
there
was
a
delicious
odour
of
tar
about
him
you
positively
could
not
look
at
him
without
hearing
wind
whistling
through
ropes
he
hitched
up
his
trousers
with
his
other
hand
and
said

sailorman

took
a
long
plug
of
chewing
tobacco
from

shelf
behind
him
he
knew
that
toby
would
not
mind
making
a
little
gift
to
the
sailorman
after
his
long
journey
he
put
the
plug
under
the
cutter
on
the
counter
and
was
about
to
press
down
the
handle
to
cut
off
a
portion
when
the
able
seaman
hitched
up
his
trousers
and
said
belay
there

and
gnawed
off
a
corner
with
his
teeth
ah
said
he
his
right
cheek
bulging
out
too
much
ballast
to

and
he
gnawed
off

left
cheek
bulged
out

his
right
all
snug
said
he

he
placed
in
freddie
hand
a
folded
sheet
of
soiled
paper
it
was
greasy
with
handling
and
was
evidently
very
old
it
was
folded
small
and
tight
and
was
beginning
to
break
with
age
at
the
creases
on
the
outside
it
was
blank
but
there
might
have
been
writing
inside
got

chinaman
and
lemuel
mizzen

on
deck
before
the
smoke
cleared
away
that
clear
yes

said
freddie
with
eyes
wide
open
and
now
as
i
see
there
no
orders
to
give
i
off
to
my
tight
little
bark
called
the
sieve
and
when
i
aboard
i
close
all
the
shutters
and
lock
up
the
parrot
that
sneezes
and
stutters
and
wake
all
the
skippers
and
put
on
my
slippers
and
get
into
bed
while
the
mates
overhead
are
swabbing
the
decks
and
heaving
the
lead
and
baling
the
up
with
their
dippers
and
when
they
have
gotten
the
vessel
to
going
and
settled
all
down
to
their
knitting
and
sewing
and
the
mate
who
is
always
so
late
has
learned
what
is
meant
by
a
third
and
last
warning
i
turn
up
the
gas
take
a
look
at
the
glass
and
read
me
the
life
of
old
chew
until
morning
and
so
sir
continued
mizzen
walking
towards
the
street
door
i
must
give
you
a
view
of
my
little
and
bid
you
dear
sir
a
very
good
night
so
saying
he
turned
squarely
towards
freddie
with
one
hand
on
the
and
with
the
other
hand
touched
his
cap
respectfully
freddie
saw
that
his
trousers
were
very
wide
at
the
ankles
and
very
tight
at
the
hips
and
that
he
rolled
a
little
when
he
walked
having
touched
his
cap
respectfully
he
opened
the
door
and
went
out
and
disappeared
in
the
darkness
outside
freddie
stood
looking
after
him
with
his
mouth
wide
open
chapter
vii
the
hands
of
the
clock
come
together
it
was
some
minutes
before
freddie
recovered
from
his
astonishment
certainly
this
was
a
strange
sailorman
and
he
had
come
all
the
way
from
the
china
sea
at
a
puff
of
the
chinaman
tobacco
certainly
magic
tobacco
that
but
it
was
a
pity
that
mizzen
had
been
called
away
from
the
china
sea
all
for
nothing
while
he
was
so
busy
gathering
boxes
to
box
compasses
with
no
wonder
he
had
felt
put
out
about
it
and
it
must
have
been
a
queer
sort
of
ship
with
its
shutters
and
all
those
skippers
and
mates
did
they
really
like
to
knit
and
sew
after
they
had
got
the
ship
to
going
it
would
be
a
wonderful
thing
to
sail
in
a
ship
like
that
he
wished
he
had
thought
to
ask
mizzen
more
about
it
he
must
tell
aunt
amanda
at
once
he
ran
to
the
back
door
and
burst
into
the
back
room
crying
out
aunt
amanda
aunt
amanda
was
sound
asleep
in
her
chair
with
her
head
back
and
her
mouth
open
the
gas
was
burning
brightly
overhead
and
the
clock
was
ticking
away
distinctly
on
the
aunt
amanda
cried
freddie
she
awoke
with
a
jump
blinked
her
eyes
and
said
hah
where
the
what
the
who
said
where
toby
what
the
matter
it
me
aunt
amanda
cried
freddie
breathlessly
and
the
sailorman
just
been
here
and
gone
and
i
called
him
with
the
pipe
and
i
can
call
him
whenever
i
want
him
and
he
gave
me
a
piece
of
paper
and
he
talks
like
a
and
there
a
parrot
that
stutters
and
they
have
to
bale
out
the
water
with
dippers
because
the
named
the
sieve
and
we
must
lose
the
paper
because
the
runaway
sailor
wore
false
whiskers
and
he
feeds
on
tacks
instead
of
pins
and
we
have
to
hold
on
tight
to
the
paper
and
one
of
the
men
on
the
ship
is
always
late
and
we
must
lose
the
paper
because
stop
stop
said
aunt
amanda
what
on
earth
is
the
child
talking
about
what
all
this
about
a
sailorman
and
a
paper
he
the
one
that
brought
the
chinaman
tobacco
from
china
and
he
gave
me
a
piece
of
paper
and
here
it
is
and
we
must
lose
it
because
one
minute
freddie
now
you
just
stand
right
there
perfectly
still
and
tell
me
about
it
slowly
now
then
what
about
this
sailorman
slow
slow
it
was
a
long
time
before
freddie
made
her
understand
exactly
what
had
happened
but
at
last
she
did
understand
from
beginning
to
end
she
was
grieved
and
horrified
that
he
had
smoked
the
tobacco
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
now
and
she
was
too
much
excited
by
his
tale
to
scold
him
very
long
what
the
paper
he
give
you
said
she
when
he
had
told
her
everything
freddie
put
the
paper
in
her
hand
and
she
unfolded
it
carefully
why
said
she
it
a
map
what

advanced
into

was
a
hunchbacked
man
of
the
same
height
as

he
was
holding
out
in
one
hand
a
bunch
of
black

as

linked
his
arm
in
his

two
hunchbacks

forward

freddie
it
punch
himself
bless
me
if

ai
freddie
edged
a
little
closer
to
aunt

for
he
was
afraid

up
and
carry

off
to
his
father
in
the
tower
punch
noticed
this
no

his

almost
to

ears
hi

this

hif
me
kind

permit

for
a
brief
period
together
with
their
charmin
gaslight
which
it
is
wery
dim
hall
night
in
the
street
and
quite
hunsatisfactory
accordingly
most
pleased
to
haccept
me
friend
toby
kind
hi
assure
you
one
grows
quite
cramped
in
one
legs
and
one
harms
when
one
to
remain
in
one
position
on
one
box
hall
night
unless
one
father
should
tyke
hit
into
to
call
one
hup
for
a
bit
of
a
lark
and
one
can
never
be
sure
of
one
father
it
in
to
call
one
hup
to
nothing
of
one
fingers
coming
stiffer
and
stiffer
with
one
parcel
of
cigars
out
in
one
and
no
on
one
and
no
on
one
to
defend
one
against
the
hevening
hair
with
one
nose
dropping
hicicles
in
winter
so
that
one
never
knows
when
one
will
lose
one
nose
off
of
one
fyce
excuse
me
said
aunt
amanda
it
was
evident
that
punch
was
a
talkative
person
are
you
an
englishman
ho
lor
miss
indeed
said
punch
a
henglishman
as
ever
was
hi
assure
you
but
i
i
give
myself
no
hairs
freddie
gave
up
trying
to
understand
the
difference
between
air
and
hair
it
was
plain
enough
that
the
man
had
never
given
himself
any
hair
so
it
could
be
that
anyway
this
was
an
englishman
and
freddie
was
glad
that
he
would
now
probably
have
a
chance
to
hear
english
spoken
which
he
had
never
heard
before
toby
said
aunt
amanda
freddie
has
seen
the
sailorman
from
china
and
he
has
a
map
i
tell
you
about
it
thereupon
she
related
the
story
of
lemuel
mizzen
as
she
had
got
it
from
freddie
toby
and
punch
were
both
tremendously
impressed
it
too
bad
said
toby
this
young
feller
here
had
to
go
and
smoke
the
chinaman
tobacco
after
i
told
him
not
to
it
too
bad
that
what
it
is
what
did
you
mean
by
it
sir
hit
a
wery
naughty
haction
indeed
said
punch
wery
reprehensible
wery
hi
car
as
i
ever
of
a
thing
so
hextremely
reprehensible
now
when
hi
was
a
lad
you
do
say
so
said
toby
well
i
do
see
anything
so
very
bad
about
it
i
a
done
it
myself
if
i
been
in
his
place
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
that
my
freddie
reprehensible
i
wo
have
nobody
callin
him
names
i
wo
and
what
more
no
offense
toby
no
offense
cried
punch
sorry
hi
assure
you
wery
reprehensible
of
me
to
such
a
thing
wery
pray
be
calm
be
calm
well
then
grumbled
toby
do
you
go
and
say
nothing
about
freddie
because
anyway
let
have
a
look
at
the
map
at
that
moment
there
came
a
timid
knock
upon
the
door
who
next
said
toby
come
in
chapter
viii
celluloid
cuffs
and
a
silk
hat
the
door
opened
and
there
entered
a
elderly
man
bowing
and
scraping
as
he
came
and
saluting
the
company
with
an
old
rusty
dented
tall
hat
which
he
carried
in
his
hand
the
most
striking
thing
about
him
was
that
he
had
a
wooden
leg
his
hair
was
grey
and
thin
and
his
face
was
not
very
clean
there
were
signs
of
tobacco
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
his
clothes
were
frayed
and
patched
and
there
was
a
good
deal
of
grease
on
his
vest
he
wore
a
celluloid
collar
without
any
necktie
and
round
celluloid
cuffs
his
were
much
too
short
and
his
cuffs
hung
out
certainly
three
inches
strange
to
say
his
collar
and
cuffs
were
spotlessly
clean
and
presented
quite
a
contrast
to
his
very
untidy
face
and
clothes
but
then
celluloid
is
easy
to
clean
much
less
trouble
than
washing
the
face
as
he
stumped
into
the
room
he
kept
bowing
humbly
from
one
to
another
and
bobbing
his
old
hat
up
and
down
in
his
hand
ahem
he
said
making
another
bow
i
was
just
going
by
and
i
thought
i
would
drop
in
to
er
ahem
i
hope
i
am
not
in
the
way
oh
come
in
said
toby
not
very
graciously
as
long
as
you
are
here
you
might
as
well
stay
this
is
punch
and
this
is
freddie
the
elderly
man
bowed
to
freddie
and
went
up
to
punch
and
shook
him
cordially
by
the
hand
he
put
his
mouth
quite
close
to
punch
ear
and
lowered
his
voice
and
said
ahem
i
delighted
to
know
you
sir
i
trust
you
are
well
i
have
seen
you
often
but
not
to
speak
to
ahem
he
lowered
his
voice
again
and
spoke
very
confidentially
into
punch
ear
the
fact
is
sir
that
as
i
was
going
by
i
suddenly
found
that
i
had
left
my
tobacco
pouch
at
home
most
unfortunate
and
i
came
in
with
the
hope
that
perhaps
er
ahem
very
seldom
forget
my
tobacco
very
seldom
indeed
perfectly
lost
without
it
do
you
er
ahem
do
you
happen
to
have
such
a
thing
about
you
as
a
er
ahem
a
small
portion
of
er
smoking
tobacco
i
should
be
very
much
obliged
sorry
said
punch
stiffly
backing
away
hi
never
use
tobacco
in
any
way
shape
or
form
the
elderly
man
looked
much
disappointed
and
sighed
he
turned
to
toby
and
bowed
and
smiled
hopefully
perhaps
littleback
he
began
not
on
your
life
said
toby
you
do
get
no
tobacco
out
of
me
and
that
flat
the
elderly
man
sighed
again
and
looked
steadily
at
freddie
but
he
evidently
thought
there
was
no
hope
in
that
quarter
and
he
said
nothing
freddie
now
realized
who
the
elderly
gentleman
was
he
had
a
wooden
leg
and
he
never
bought
tobacco
when
tobacco
he
could
beg
it
was
the
old
codger
whom
toby
had
now
and
then
sung
a
song
about
one
of
his
two
friends
the
one
who
was
always
begging
tobacco
and
never
had
any
of
his
own
freddie
looked
at
him
and
felt
rather
sorry
for
him
ahem
said
the
old
codger
with
the
wooden
leg
very
sorry
to
intrude
miss
amanda
i
hope
i
not
in
the
way
it
very
mild
weather
having
now
then
said
toby
briskly
let
look
at
this
map
as
he
said
this
another
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
a
firm
and
confident
knock
this
time
confound
it
said
toby
who
next
come
in
the
door
opened
and
another
elderly
man
stepped
in
a
tall
slim
man
with
very
white
hair
and
a
long
narrow
face
he
carried
a
tall
shiny
black
silk
hat
in
his
hand
he
wore
a
black
suit
all
of
broadcloth
and
his
coat
hung
to
his
knees
and
was
buttoned
to
the
top
his
cuffs
and
collar
and
shirt
were
of
beautiful
white
linen
with
a
gloss
and
his
tie
was
a
little
white
linen
bow
he
came
forward
with
an
air
of
warm
benevolence
my
dear
friends
he
said
and
stretched
out
both
hands
towards
the
company
as
if
to
clasp
them
all
to
his
heart
what
a
beautiful
beautiful
scene
so
homelike
so
cosy
so
sociable
so
so
what
can
be
so
beautiful
as
the
gathering
together
of
friends
about
the
family
hearth
beautiful
there
was
a
latrobe
stove
in
the
room
but
no
hearth
however
that
made
no
difference
he
went
with
his
hands
outstretched
to
aunt
amanda
and
pressed
one
of
hers
in
both
of
his
the
old
codger
with
the
wooden
leg
immediately
sidled
up
to
him
and
while
he
was
still
pressing
aunt
amanda
hand
said
in
a
confidential
tone
ahem
i
delighted
to
see
you
again
i
trust
you
are
well
the
fact
is
i
find
that
i
have
er
left
my
tobacco
pouch
at
home
most
unfortunate
very
seldom
forget
it
completely
lost
without
it
i
was
wondering
er
ahem
if
you
happened
to
have
such
a
thing
about
you
as
a
no
said
the
other
old
man
changing
at
once
from
beaming
benevolence
to
stern
severity
i
be
hanged
if
i
do
and
he
released
aunt
amanda
hand
and
turned
his
back
on
the
old
codger
with
the
wooden
leg
now
said
toby
let
look
at
the
map
this
here
is
punch
and
this
is
freddie
the
newcomer
took
punch
hand
in
both
of
his
and
squeezed
it
softly
he
then
took
freddie
hand
in
both
of
his
and
pressed
it
tenderly
freddie
knew
him
he
was
the
other
old
codger
as
sly
as
a
fox
who
always
had
tobacco
in
his
old
freddie
could
hardly
believe
that
that
old
gentleman
could
be
as
sly
as
a
fox
my
dear
friends
said
the
sly
old
fox
what
is
so
beautiful
as
the
love
of
friends
he
stopped
to
glare
at
the
old
codger
with
the
wooden
leg
who
looked
away
nervously
the
love
of
friends
gathered
together
around
the
family
hearth
how
beautiful
it
touches
me
my
friends
it
touches
me
that
all
right
about
that
said
toby
for
heaven
look
at
the
map
aunt
amanda
spread
out
the
map
on
the
table
beside
her
and
the
others
gathered
round
it
an
island
cried
toby
on
the
spanish
main
said
aunt
amanda
the
spanish
main
said
the
sly
old
fox
a
beautiful
country
full
of
palms
and
what
you
might
call
a
real
work
of
nature
full
of
parrots
and
monkeys
and
lagoons
and
other
wild
creatures
a
work
of
nature
my
dear
friends
a
real
work
of
nature
and
pirates
said
freddie
earnestly
i
parrots
said
the
sly
old
fox
said
pirates
said
freddie
just
what
i
said
said
the
sly
old
fox
that
live
in
trees
my
little
friend
in
trees
and
have
red
and
blue
feathers
and
pirates
do
have
feathers
said
freddie
dear
dear
said
the
sly
old
fox
how
you
say
such
a
thing
how
you
did
you
ever
see
a
pirate
in
a
tree
in
cages
my
dear
little
friend
hundreds
of
them
that
enough
said
toby
quit
wrangling
for
a
minute
will
you
what
about
this
here
map
i
tell
you
what
though
i
like
the
churchwarden
to
see
this
map
freddie
will
you
run
down
the
street
and
get
the
churchwarden
yes
sir
said
freddie
moving
towards
the
door
and
tell
him
to
bring
along
his
odour
of
sanctity
with
him
he
always
carries
a
bottle
of
it
in
his
pocket
and
we
may
need
it
do
forget
it
no
sir
said
freddie
hold
on
a
minute
said
toby
snatching
up
his
hat
i
go
for
him
myself
i
can
do
it
quicker
and
in
a
moment
he
was
out
of
the
door
chapter
ix
the
odour
of
sanctity
while
toby
was
gone
aunt
amanda
explained
to
the
two
old
men
about
the
sailorman
from
china
and
about
his
gift
of
the
map
which
was
lying
on
the
table
they
were
just
at
the
end
of
their
discussion
when
toby
returned
bringing
with
him
the
churchwarden
puffing
and
blowing
with
the
unusual
exertion
of
walking
and
without
his
pipe
toby
introduced
him
to
punch
and
the
two
old
codgers
and
drew
him
up
to
the
table
and
showed
him
the
map
explaining
at
the
same
time
how
it
came
there
the
churchwarden
examined
the
map
carefully
while
the
others
all
looked
at
him
he
finally
put
down
the
map
settled
himself
in
a
chair
folded
his
hands
across
his
fat
stomach
blew
out
his
cheeks
and
said
my
opinion
is
that
what
we
ought
to
do
is
to
i
considered
the
matter
carefully
from
all
sides
and
i
think
we
ought
to
of
course
you
may
not
agree
with
me
but
i
think
the
best
thing
to
do
would
be
to
unless
of
course
some
of
you
may
think
of
something
better
but
if
you
do
then
i
ca
say
as
there
anything
better
to
do
than
to
at
this
moment
there
came
a
sound
from
the
street
outside
which
made
everyone
but
aunt
amanda
jump
to
his
feet
it
was
the
sound
of
running
feet
mixed
with
strange
cries
not
very
loud
but
somehow
it
was
evident
that
someone
was
in
trouble
freddie
and
the
five
men
rushed
from
the
room
and
through
the
shop
and
into
the
street
the
street
was
very
dark
except
for
a
at
the
opposite
corner
a
white
figure
was
running
down
the
pavement
towards
the
with
frantic
speed
and
behind
him
evidently
chasing
him
came
a
crowd
of
little
dark
creatures
hard
to
make
out
in
the
dim
light
it
was
these
creatures
who
were
making
the
little
cries
in
a
moment
they
had
come
so
near
that
the
party
about
the
could
see
what
they
were
in
front
running
desperately
with
leaps
and
bounds
and
panting
for
breath
came
a
tall
slim
man
all
in
white
clothes
with
a
dead
white
face
and
a
white
hairless
head
and
after
him
tumbling
on
was
a
perfect
riot
of
little
red
imps
with
little
horns
on
their
foreheads
and
little
tails
behind
them
all
trying
to
spear
the
white
man
with
the
wicked
little
pitchforks
which
they
carried
and
to
seize
him
with
their
claws
freddie
thought
they
were
precisely
like
the
imps
he
had
seen
at
hanlon
superba
when
the
white
man
reached
the
they
had
nearly
caught
him
he
paused
at
that
moment
looked
wildly
about
him
saw
the
open
door
of
the
shop
and
dashed
in
and
banged
the
door
to
behind
him
the
imps
came
tumbling
up
and
hesitated
an
instant
before
the
men
at
the
door
and
in
that
instant
the
churchwarden
showed
the
most
unexpected
presence
of
mind
he
quickly
reached
behind
him
and
drew
a
small
bottle
out
of
his
pocket
and
pulled
out
the
cork
and
sprinkled
a
few
drops
of
its
contents
on
the
ground
before
him
a
sharp
penetrating
odour
immediately
filled
the
air
it
was
so
intense
that
it
made
the
tears
come
into
freddie
eyes
but
what
it
did
to
the
wild
mob
of
imps
was
almost
beyond
belief
as
they
got
their
first
whiff
of
it
they
tumbled
back
over
one
another
in
a
mad
effort
to
get
away
but
they
could
not
get
away
from
the
odour
quick
enough
it
caught
them
and
held
them
so
that
in
a
moment
they
could
not
move
they
stood
fixed
and
fast
and
silent
in
another
moment
they
began
to
melt
away
and
in
two
minutes
they
had
vanished
actually
vanished
where
they
stood
each
and
every
one
before
the
very
eyes
of
the
astonished
party
before
the
door
blimy
hif
i
ever
see
the
like
said
punch
never
knew
my
odour
of
sanctity
to
fail
once
said
the
churchwarden
coolly
hardly
ever
go
out
without
it
there
ai
a
witch
or
an
imp
or
a
bad
spirit
of
any
kind
whatever
can
stand
up
against
my
odour
of
sanctity
if
he
once
gets
a
couple
of
good
whiffs
of
it
out
of
this
little
bottle
just
a
few
drops
from
the
bottle
and
a
few
sniffs
and
whoof
they
done
for
no
sir
there
ai
no
perfumery
in
the
world
like
odour
of
sanctity
on
the
floor
of
the
shop
they
found
the
poor
white
man
lying
completely
exhausted
they
asked
him
to
explain
but
he
could
not
speak
toby
and
punch
one
on
each
side
supported
him
into
the
back
room
and
sat
him
down
in
a
chair
before
aunt
amanda
she
held
up
her
hands
in
astonishment
the
man
was
certainly
a
man
they
plied
him
with
questions
but
he
touched
his
tongue
with
his
finger
and
shook
his
head
he
could
not
speak
he
was
dumb
freddie
after
one
long
look
at
him
under
the
gaslight
knew
who
he
was
it
mr
hanlon
he
cried
in
great
excitement
it
mr
hanlon
the
dumb
man
looked
at
freddie
and
smiled
and
nodded
his
head
he
rose
to
his
feet
shook
freddie
hand
and
made
a
graceful
bow
to
the
whole
company
it
hanlon
sure
enough
said
toby
still
being
chased
by
the
imps
pretty
near
got
him
that
time
too
but
he
got
away
safe
and
sound
after
all
did
he
eh
and
all
the
party
including
hanlon
himself
laughed
with
delight
and
when
the
churchwarden
pulled
out
his
little
perfume
bottle
and
showed
it
around
and
explained
to
hanlon
what
it
had
done
the
poor
man
was
so
overcome
that
he
put
his
head
down
on
the
churchwarden
shoulder
and
wept
this
never
do
cried
toby
ai
we
never
going
to
get
down
to
this
here
map
i
never
such
a
time
as
i
had
trying
to
examine
this
here
map
one
thing
right
after
another
hanlon
tell
you
what
it
about
and
then
you
can
see
it
for
yourself
would
you
like
to
stay
here
with
our
little
party
it
a
good
deal
safer
than
hanlon
nodded
eagerly
and
smiled
and
toby
explained
everything
to
him
and
showed
him
the
map
now
said
toby
when
that
was
done
speak
up
warden
and
finish
what
you
was
chapter
x
captain
higginson
and
the
spanish
main
the
churchwarden
having
put
back
into
his
pocket
the
bottle
of
odour
of
sanctity
folded
his
hands
across
his
fat
stomach
and
began
again
as
i
was
saying
never
mind
that
said
toby
tell
us
what
we
had
better
do
well
as
i
was
saying
went
on
the
churchwarden
paying
no
attention
to
toby
the
best
idea
that
occurs
to
me
after
thinking
it
over
considerable
is
that
but
i
ai
saying
there
none
better
and
i
do
lay
claim
to
being
any
wiser
than
anyway
it
seems
to
me
we
ought
to
just
listen
to
this
broke
in
aunt
amanda
she
had
been
studying
the
map
all
this
time
and
she
was
holding
it
in
her
hands
she
was
much
excited
i
just
made
out
all
this
handwriting
at
the
bottom
of
the
map
and
i
read
it
to
you
do
you
want
to
hear
it
her
voice
shook
and
her
hands
trembled
everybody
except
the
churchwarden
begged
her
to
go
on
oh
do
you
think
it
could
be
true
if
it
only
could
oh
if
it
only
be
true
maybe
if
you
read
it
aunt
amanda
said
toby
yes
yes
i
will
said
she
all
of
a
twitter
i
read
it
hurry
me
this
is
what
it
says
if
it
could
only
be
true
island
by
dead
reckoning
latitude
longitude
whatever
that
means
but
i
read
it
to
you
just
as
written
it
a
queer
kind
of
language
anyway
this
is
what
it
says
discovered
by
me
reuben
higginson
master
mariner
brig
cotton
mather
new
bedford
elizabeth
higginson
spinster
or
else
the
acknowledged
elder
of
the
society
of
friends
new

off
course
in
heavy
gale
on
return
voyage
to
fetch
my
sister
aforesaid
to
correction

with
as
many
others
as
are
minded
to
come
badly

in
another
hour
map
shall
be
cast
overboard
in
a
stout
bottel
as
we
go
down
with
a
paper
of
directions
how
to
gain
correction
in
the
island
where
the
paper
of
directions
said
toby
it
ai
here
said
aunt
amanda
i
suppose
captain
higginson
lost
it
or
else
he
did
have
time
to
put
it
in
the
bottle
anyway
this
is
what
the
writing
on
the
map
says
him
that
finds
the
bottel
remember
these
mariners
also
let
him
take
heed
to
search
out
the
island
diligently
this
island
listen
to
what
it
says
now
said
aunt
amanda
trembling
with
excitement
oh
do
you
suppose
it
could
really
be
true
and
yet
this
reuben
higginson
was
a
good
quaker
captain
i
sure
and
i
do
believe
he
would
say
what
was
true
and
especially
when
he
was
on
his
way
home
to
get
his
own
sister
why
do
you
read
it
instead
of
talking
about
it
said
toby
i
would
if
you
let
me
said
aunt
amanda
here
what
it
says
this
island
is
refuge
to
such
as
be
afflicted
and
in
this
island
shall
be
corrected
oh
listen
to
this
i
would
believe
it
from
anybody
but
reuben
higginson
be
corrected
whatever
errors
disappointments
miscarriages
faylures
preventions
and
the
like
this
mortal
life
may
have
afflicted
any
withal
wherefore
i
have
called
it
correction
island
be
perils
enough
in
coming
at
compleat
correction
but
let
courage
halt
not
by
the
way
so
shall
he
arrive
presently
any
be
crooked
this
is
the
part
it
too
wonderful
but
captain
higginson
would
have
said
it
when
he
was
so
near
going
down
with
his
ship
and
especially
on
his
way
home
to
get
his
own
sister
me
dear
lydy
said
punch
you
would
be
so
wery
kind
as
to
yes
yes
give
me
time
i
declare
you
make
me
so
nervous
now
just
listen
to
this
every
one
of
you
and
do
speak
any
be
crooked
he
shall
there
be
made
straight
she
paused
and
looked
hard
at
toby
punch
started
at
the
same
time
and
he
and
toby
looked
hard
at
each
other
any
be
blind
he
shall
see
if
any
dumb
he
shall
speak
at
the
word
dumb
hanlon
whose
elbow
was
resting
on
the
table
jumped
so
violently
that
he
knocked
the
album
onto
the
floor
aunt
amanda
nodded
her
head
to
him
and
all
the
others
stared
at
him
any
be
old
he
shall
be
young
again
if
any
fat
he
shall
be
as
lean
as
he
will
at
the
word
fat
the
churchwarden
gave
a
questioning
grunt
and
settled
down
deeper
in
his
chair
any
be
poor
whether
in
purse
or
in
mind
he
shall
seek
alms
no
longer
the
old
codger
with
the
wooden
leg
who
had
been
resting
his
wooden
leg
on
the
chair
opposite
dropped
it
to
the
floor
and
sat
up
very
straight
toby
who
was
standing
beside
him
clapped
him
heartily
on
the
shoulder
any
be
mean
or
cunning
or
despiteful
he
shall
be
given
a
new
heart
aunt
amanda
looked
directly
at
the
sly
old
codger
who
was
sitting
smiling
with
his
tall
silk
hat
on
his
knees
and
everyone
else
in
the
room
except
hanlon
looked
very
intently
at
him
he
noticed
it
and
glanced
around
inquiringly
smiling
more
benevolently
than
ever
how
beautiful
that
would
be
he
said
how
beautiful
if
some
of
my
dear
dear
friends
could
only
have
a
new
heart
how
beautiful
do
interrupt
said
aunt
amanda
freddie
listen
to
this
any
be
little
in
stature
against
his
desire
he
shall
be
great
freddie
opened
his
eyes
very
wide
would
it
be
possible
to
be
big
at
once
without
waiting
all
that
long
dreary
time
how
glorious
that
would
be
but
this
said
aunt
amanda
this
is
the
last
and
the
best
i
know
whether
i
can
read
it
right
her
voice
broke
and
she
blew
her
nose
and
cleared
her
throat
but
i
will
try
oh
do
you
suppose
it
be
true
would
a
good
quaker
captain
with
a
sister
in
new
bedford
say
it
if
it
was
true
with
the
sea
raging
and
both
masts
gone
and
the
ship
filling
up
with
water
and
aunt
amanda
said
toby
if
you
do
read
the
rest
of
it
this
minute
ah
yes
toby
i
will
said
aunt
amanda
it
must
be
true
or
a
good
man
like
that
would
have
said
it
this
is
the
last
part
and
the
best
any
be
prevented
unjustly
of
beauty
or
of
children
or
of
love
or
of
other
like
desires
there
shall
be
found
for
him
of
these
a
great
store
so
that
there
shall
be
an
end
of
repining
and
none
in
that
place
shall
say
thus
and
thus
might
i
have
been
also
had
i
been
but
justly
entreated
so
i
commit
my
body
to
the
sea
and
my
soul
to
go
on
go
on
cried
the
company
excepting
of
course
hanlon
aunt
amanda
blew
her
nose
again
and
laid
down
the
map
on
the
table
that
all
she
said
i
suppose
he
did
have
time
to
finish
it
chapter
xi
a
mixed
company
in
search
of
adventure
after
aunt
amanda
had
stopped
reading
it
was
a
moment
or
two
before
anyone
spoke
if
all
those
things
said
toby
thoughtfully
could
be
done
in
that
island
i
be
in
favor
of
going
there
there
was
a
general
murmur
of
assent
and
hanlon
nodded
his
head
well
went
on
toby
we
better
make
up
our
minds
what
we
want
to
do
about
it
the
churchwarden
ai
had
his
say
yet
what
with
all
these
interruptions
and
i
move
we
give
him
a
chance
to
have
his
say
right
now
speak
up
warden
what
do
you
think
we
ought
to
do
as
i
was
saying
said
the
churchwarden
looking
around
solemnly
while
i
do
hold
to
my
own
opinion
if
anybody
else
can
think
up
something
better
still
it
seems
to
me
but
maybe
you
ruther
hear
from
the
others
first
no
no
cried
the
whole
company
except
hanlon
who
shook
his
head
vigorously
well
then
being
as
you
asked
me
so
particular
and
having
thought
about
it
considerable
as
i
was
saying
it
appears
to
me
that
the
best
thing
to
do
would
be
to
this
is
only
the
way
it
looks
to
me
you
understand
and
i
ai
speaking
for
nobody
but
myself
and
i
pretend
that
my
opinion
is
worth
by
crackey
cried
toby
very
rudely
ai
you
the
most
maddening
old
feller
that
ever
was
in
the
world
come
on
now
tell
us
what
to
do
and
be
quick
about
it
call
up
the
able
seaman
this
was
so
unexpected
that
nobody
spoke
for
a
moment
hurrah
cried
toby
now
you
said
it
we
call
up
lemuel
mizzen
is
that
his
name
that
the
thing
to
do
do
you
all
agree
to
that
everybody
approved
and
toby
turned
to
freddie
he
your
man
freddie
and
if
you
done
it
once
i
reckon
it
wo
be
any
harm
for
you
to
do
it
again
wait
a
minute
and
he
ran
into
the
shop
and
immediately
returned
with
the
chinaman
head
and
a
churchwarden
pipe
now
then
freddie
he
said
will
you
do
it
again
no
sir
said
freddie
i
rather
not
you
should
make
him
do
it
said
aunt
amanda
nonsense
aunt
amanda
cried
toby
he
as
bad
now
as
he
ever
be
and
it
ai
to
do
him
no
harm
i
fill
the
pipe
hit
quite
a
lark
said
punch
laughing
heartily
fancy
the
little
beggar
smoking
a
pipe
my
dear
little
friend
began
the
sly
old
fox
beaming
upon
freddie
you
must
always
remember
that
your
elders
know
best
here
freddie
said
toby
having
filled
the
pipe
sit
down
here
and
he
pushed
freddie
gently
down
upon
his
accustomed
hassock
at
aunt
amanda
feet
freddie
shook
his
head
but
toby
put
the
pipe
into
his
mouth
and
lit
a
match
all
the
others
sat
in
silence
watching
freddie
intently
now
then
said
toby
pull
away
and
he
touched
the
lighted
match
to
the
pipeful
of
black
tobacco
freddie
gave
a
pull
and
blew
out
a
cloud
of
smoke
he
did
not
choke
this
time
he
gave
another
pull
and
blew
out
another
cloud
the
white
smoke
lay
above
the
heads
of
the
company
in
a
thick
mass
it
grew
thicker
so
that
he
could
not
see
through
it
it
began
to
move
as
if
in
a
high
wind
he
drew
on
the
pipe
once
more
and
blew
out
another
cloud
of
smoke
he
knew
what
was
coming
and
in
fact
the
same
thing
happened
that
had
happened
to
him
before
the
white
cloud
churned
about
with
its
and
jets
of
fire
coming
down
closer
and
closer
upon
him
and
in
a
jiffy
he
was
sitting
in
midair
on
his
hassock
and
then
he
felt
himself
falling
falling
and
as
he
struck
the
bottom
with
a
jar
he
heard
very
distinctly
a
knock
on
the
door
and
he
was
sitting
again
on
his
hassock
at
aunt
amanda
feet
in
the
quiet
room
with
no
sign
of
a
cloud
anywhere
to
be
seen
come
in
he
heard
toby
cry
the
door
opened
and
in
walked
lemuel
mizzen
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
he
took
off
his
flat
blue
cap
with
the
black
ribbon
and
made
a
bow
to
the
company

me
aft
again
and

he
in

lemuel
mizzen
that
me
what

be
all
ready
for

skipper
it
was
just
half
past
by
the
starboard
watch
and
the
skippers
their
apples
were
quietly
peeling
when
i
locked
up
the
last
of
the
lemons
and
scotch
and
lay
on
my
bed
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
to
snatch
forty
winks
as
i
foolishly
reckoned
but
just
as
i
thinks
there
a
ring
at
the
bell
of
the
big
and
the
mates
come
and
yell
that
i
wanted
ashore
so
i
tucks
in
my
cap
the
eight
points
of
my
nap
and
just
before
stopping
to
turn
down
the
lights
i
runs
to
the
dresser
and
puts
it
to
rights
and
then
before
giving
a
last
look
behind
i
goes
to
the
bed
and
takes
off
the
spread
and
lays
out
to
air
the
three
sheets
in
the
wind
and
here
i
be
concluded
the
able
seaman
all
ready
for
orders
and
he
looked
very
hard
at
freddie

moment

the
sly
old
codger

the
sly
old
fox

spanish

the
little
parrots
and
monkeys
flitting
about
in
the
branches
of
the
upas
trees

reckon

said
toby

my
vote

hold
of
our
able
seaman
here

i
tell
mother
first

freddie

her
a
note
in
the
morning
said
toby
i

to
me
i
suppose
i
really
ought
to
finish
this
sewing
said
aunt
amanda
no
time
said
toby
who
seemed
to
be
managing
everything
where
the
ship
mr
mizzen
made
fast
to
the
wharf
at
the
foot
of
this
street
said
mizzen
then
let
go
said
toby
he
ran
out
of
the
room
and
returned
with
his
white
derby
hat
on
his
head
and
his
necktie
neatly
in
its
place
he
helped
aunt
amanda
to
get
up
and
brought
her
her
little
black
bonnet
which
she
put
on
and
tied
under
her
chin
and
her
cashmere
shawl
which
she
put
around
her
shoulders
all
right
cried
toby
we
off
come
along
we
off
to
the
spanish
main
said
mizzen
in
his
curious
to
the
wet
antipodee
but
dry
or
wet
we
need
not
fret
for
we
are
bold
as
bold
can
be
and
on
the
way
at
botany
bay
we
probably
stay
a
week
or
two
to
gather
ferns
as
the
botanists
do
and
then
stop
at
the
door
of
spain
to
ask
the
way
to
the
spanish
main
and
so
without
any
more
delay
on
the
spanish
main
we
all
alight
where
the
shines
in
the
sea
all
night
and
the
barks
in
the
sky
all
day
here
skipper
put
this
in
your
pocket
and
hold
fast
to
it
he
handed
freddie
the
map
and
freddie
put
it
away
safely
in
his
pocket
have
you
got
the
odour
of
sanctity
said
toby
to
the
churchwarden
right
here
said
the
fat
man
tapping
his
back
pocket
i
carry
the
chinaman
tobacco
said
toby
we
may
need
it
and
he
tucked
the
chinaman
head
under
his
arm
in
a
few
moments
the
whole
party
were
standing
on
the
pavement
outside
and
toby
locked
the
behind
them
they
crossed
the
street
and
as
they
did
so
they
heard
a
faint
voice
halloing
from
the
top
of
the
church
tower
and
they
could
make
out
that
it
said
punch
punch
but
punch
only
sniffed
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
made
no
answer
it
was
very
dark
the
at
the
corners
only
made
the
darkness
gloomier
the
only
sound
they
heard
after
punch
father
voice
had
died
away
behind
them
was
the
of
the
old
wooden
leg
on
the
brick
pavement
all
the
were
closed
and
as
they
came
nearer
to
the
wharves
all
the
warehouses
were
dark
and
awful
not
a
soul
was
to
be
seen
except
that
once
they
saw
the
back
of
a
policeman
as
he
disappeared
around
a
dark
corner
in
advance
at
the
sight
of
this
policeman
back
and
in
the
shadow
of
a
great
gloomy
building
alongside
an
alley
freddie
slipped
his
hand
into
the
able
seaman
big
paw
he
wondered
if
he
were
doing
quite
right
in
leaving
home
without
saying
a
word
to
his
mother
but
toby
had
promised
to
do
whatever
was
necessary
and
anyway
he
was
going
aboard
a
ship
if
he
should
stop
to
speak
to
his
mother
about
going
away
on
a
voyage
in
a
ship
he
felt
somehow
that
he
might
never
go
he
could
already
smell
the
delicious
odour
of
tarred
ropes
their
progress
was
very
slow
on
account
of
aunt
amanda
lameness
first
came
mizzen
leading
the
way
with
freddie
by
his
side
next
came
aunt
amanda
limping
with
her
cane
and
supported
on
one
side
by
toby
and
on
the
other
by
punch
behind
them
walked
the
churchwarden
and
the
sly
old
fox
and
last
of
all
hanlon
and
the
old
codger
with
the
wooden
leg
they
could
see
not
far
before
them
the
masts
and
shrouds
of
ships
looking
as
if
they
were
growing
up
from
the
street
among
the
buildings
and
in
another
moment
they
found
themselves
standing
in
a
group
on
a
wide
wharf
piled
up
with
bales
and
boxes
and
before
them
against
the
edge
of
the
wharf
where
the
black
water
was
lapping
the
piles
stood
a
tall
ship
with
most
of
her
sails
set
freddie
thrilled
in
every
vein
of
his
body
at
that
moment
he
did
not
think
of
his
father
or
mother
he
thought
of
nothing
but
the
smell
of
brackish
water
and
tarred
ropes
and
the
deck
of
a
ship
on
the
open
sea
under
a
cloud
of
canvas
and
the
spanish
main
the
able
seaman
led
the
company
of
adventurers
forward
between
the
bales
and
boxes
until
they
stood
beside
the
dark
hull
of
the
ship
he
turned
round
and
faced
them
and
touched
his
cap
respectfully
come
aboard
said
he
chapter
xii
the
voyage
of
the
sieve
when
freddie
awoke
the
next
morning
he
leaned
up
on
his
elbow
rubbing
his
eyes
and
was
surprised
to
see
the
floor
of
the
little
room
in
which
he
found
himself
settling
slowly
down
at
one
side
in
a
moment
the
floor
rose
again
on
that
side
and
the
other
side
settled
down
then
the
whole
room
tilted
sideways
and
back
again
it
made
him
dizzy
and
he
closed
his
eyes
wondering
what
kind
of
a
house
he
had
gotten
into
he
decided
he
would
get
up
and
find
out
about
it
he
carefully
rose
and
tried
to
walk
across
the
floor
to
the
window
as
he
stepped
out
the
floor
seemed
to
go
down
under
him
and
he
quickly
grasped
the
bed
he
put
out
his
foot
again
and
the
floor
rose
up
he
was
dizzier
than
before
and
he
had
a
queer
sinking
feeling
in
his
stomach
as
the
floor
tilted
down
sideways
again
he
made
a
dash
to
the
opposite
wall
and
held
on
there
by
the
window
but
the
floor
sank
again
and
he
made
another
dash
back
to
bed
he
was
cold
and
hot
and
his
head
ached
and
there
was
a
feeling
in
his
stomach
as
if
oh
dear
he
decided
he
would
lie
in
bed
for
a
few
moments
until
he
felt
better
he
remained
there
for
two
days
what
occurred
during
those
two
days
he
could
not
remember
very
well
afterwards
he
slept
a
great
deal
and
it
seemed
that
some
one
with
a
green
patch
over
his
eye
came
in
now
and
then
but
he
paid
very
little
attention
all
he
wanted
was
to
go
to
sleep
and
stay
asleep
on
the
morning
after
his
third
night
he
sat
up
wide
awake
he
was
hungry
he
jumped
up
and
dressed
in
a
hurry
as
the
floor
tilted
and
sank
and
rose
with
him
he
thought
he
had
never
felt
so
delicious
a
sensation
he
wondered
if
there
would
be
bacon
and
eggs
for
breakfast
in
a
moment
he
had
thrown
open
the
door
and
he
was
running
up
a
short
flight
of
steps
he
was
weak
and
tottery
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
that
he
was
at
the
top
of
the
steps
and
he
drew
in
a
deep
breath
of
the
cool
morning
air
he
was
standing
on
the
deck
of
a
great
ship
over
his
head
clouds
and
clouds
of
beautiful
white
canvas
swelled
out
to
the
breeze
the
sun
was
sparkling
merrily
on
the
water
and
there
was
no
land
to
be
seen
anywhere
up
forward
the
bow
of
the
ship
was
dipping
and
rising
regularly
there
were
three
tall
masts
and
on
the
first
two
the
sails
were
set
square
to
the
masts
and
on
the
third
lengthwise
every
sail
seemed
to
be
up
it
was
glorious
he
walked
forward
up
the
deck
here
and
there
were
men
in
blue
overalls
cleaning
the
deck
coiling
ropes
and
polishing
metal
and
in
a
little
house
with
windows
a
man
was
standing
beside
an
upright
wheel
near
the
first
mast
in
a
group
were
aunt
amanda
toby
the
churchwarden
and
the
two
old
codgers
freddie
hailed
them
with
a
shout
all

young
feller
cried

codger

disquieted
on
such
a
morning
as
this
everything
is
so
beautiful
beautiful
and
without
any
expense
whatever
it
is
a
precious
thought
how
pleasant
it
is
to
hear
the
breeze
blowing
so
gently
among
all
the
little
capstans
up
there
he
took
off
his
high
silk
hat
and
looked
up
among
the
sails
with
a
rapt
expression
on
his
face
and
all
the
others
looked
up
too
trying
to
see
the
capstans
fluttering
in
the
breeze
look
cried
aunt
amanda
why
there
mr
hanlon
far
far
up
near
the
top
of
the
second
mast
was
a
white
figure
standing
on
a
rope
under
the
topmost
sail
and
holding
on
with
one
hand
and
waving
the
other
down
at
the
passengers
toby
waved
his
white
derby
and
hanlon
began
to
come
down
freddie
trembled
with
alarm
but
hanlon
was
obviously
having
the
time
of
his
life
he
skipped
swiftly
along
his
dangerous
perch
and
sliding
down
and
along
the
spars
of
wood
that
held
the
sails
and
actually
leaping
from
one
to
another
and
tripping
lightly
down
ladders
of
rope
while
the
whole
top
swayed
dizzily
from
side
to
side
he
at
length
came
down
on
the
deck
with
a
bounce
and
bowing
to
everybody
shook
freddie
by
the
hand
here
comes
the
able
seaman
cried
toby
and
see
what
he
got
on
his
wrist
lemuel
mizzen
came
rolling
down
the
deck
and
as
he
approached
he
took
off
his
cap
with
his
left
hand
and
made
a
bow
on
his
right
wrist
was
a
blue
and
red
parrot
who
cocked
his
head
sideways
at
the
strangers
and
then
looked
up
inquiringly
at
the
able
seaman
good

to

and

he
tossed
master
marmaduke
off
his
wrist
up
into
the
air
the
parrot
lit
on
a
spar
overhead
just
under
a
sail
and
peered
down
at
the
company
without
the
least
appearance
of
embarrassment
if

him
down
the
deck
towards
a
kind
of
box
which
opened
on
a
stairway
below
in
a
moment
or
two
they
found
themselves
in
the
and
in
another
moment
they
were
seated
about
a
round
table
set
for
breakfast
the
passengers
insisted
on
the
able
seaman
sitting
down
with
them
and
he
consented
to
do
so
a
lad
of
about
eighteen
entered
to
wait
on
the
table
he
had
a
shock
of
bright
red
hair
and
a
kind
of
frightened
look
in
his
eyes
as
if
he
were
afraid
he
would
do
everything
wrong
and
would
always
be
in
hot
water
about
it
he
stood
behind
the
able
seaman
chair
and
began
to
make
a
queer
contortion
of
the
face
in
an
effort
to
speak
he
began
skipper
first
interrupted
mizzen
nodding
towards
freddie
the
for
that
was
what
he
was
went
to
freddie
chair
and
began
to
speak
again
with
the
same
contortion
of
the
face
and
eggs
he
said
yes
sir
said
freddie
the
stared
in
bewilderment
and
began
again
and
eggs
said
he
yes
sir
said
freddie
much
embarrassed
i
do
blame
you
skipper
said
the
able
seaman
i
would
too
if
i
had
eaten
for
two
days
next
the
stood
behind
aunt
amanda
chair
and
began
and
he
gave
a
hearty
sneeze
and
pulled
out
his
so
he
had
to
begin
all
over
again
chops
thank
you
said
aunt
amanda
the
took
his
stand
behind
toby
chair
and
began
there
there
chops
and
steak
said
toby
the
stood
behind
each
of
the
other
chairs
in
turn
and
repeated
each
time
his
entire
list
everybody
gave
a
different
order
and
the
boy
became
so
bewildered
at
last
that
he
wiped
his
forehead
with
his
brushed
a
tear
from
his
eye
and
when
he
had
taken
the
last
order
dashed
out
of
the
door
with
a
kind
of
sob
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
sounds
came
through
the
door
by
which
he
had
left
as
if
a
dreadful
row
was
going
on
in
the
next
room
frightful
temper
that
cook
said
the
able
seaman
but
the
boy
certainly
does
get
on
his
nerves
in
a
short
time
the
came
in
with
four
plates
at
once
and
as
he
reached
freddie
chair
the
ship
gave
a
deep
lurch
downward
and
the
four
plates
shot
out
of
his
arms
across
the
room
showering
the
floor
with
chops
steak
bacon
and
eggs
the
boy
gave
a
wild
cry
and
burst
into
tears
and
fled
through
the
door
from
the
next
room
came
the
sound
of
a
row
more
violent
than
before
never
mind
said
mizzen
he
be
back
he
came
back
presently
his
eyes
very
red
and
stumbling
in
and
out
managed
to
put
down
before
each
one
a
plate
every
plate
contained
chops
steak
bacon
and
eggs
now
said
mizzen
when
the
breakfast
was
over
we
go
up
and
hold
the
election
when
they
came
on
deck
they
were
astonished
to
see
a
considerable
number
of
men
in
blue
overalls
who
were
sitting
on
the
deck
in
a
group
as
the
passengers
approached
they
stood
up
respectfully
and
one
of
them
said
something
privately
to
mizzen
they
held
the
election
already
said
the
able
seaman
turning
to
the
passengers
there
three
dozen
of
and
they
elected
the
captains
and
mates
for
the
voyage
thirteen
captains
and
mates
they
went
right
ahead
without
waiting
for
me
so
i
the
only
able
seaman
left
on
the
ship
what
said
aunt
amanda
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
it
all
right
madam
said
mizzen
in
an
undertone
you
see
they
all
free
and
equal
and
everything
goes
by
voting
they
have
it
any
other
way
it
lucky
they
did
all
want
to
be
captains
it
all
right
anyway
because
there
none
of
knows
anything
about
navigation
and
i
the
only
one
on
board
that
know
so
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
as
if
they
had
elected
captain
but
of
course
do
think
of
that
not
a
word
i
send
about
their
business
now
as
soon
as
they
put
on
their
uniforms
well
said
aunt
amanda
gasping
i
never
in
my
life
the
thirteen
captains
and
the
mates
disappeared
from
the
deck
in
a
hurry
and
in
a
very
few
minutes
reappeared
each
one
of
them
wore
in
place
of
his
blue
overalls
a
smart
blue
suit
with
brass
buttons
and
gold
braid
and
a
jaunty
blue
cap
with
gold
braid
around
it
the
mates
having
only
nine
instead
of
ten
rows
of
braid
around
their
sleeves
the
able
seaman
led
them
aside
and
after
a
few
words
with
them
returned
to
his
passengers
everything
settled
said
he
some
of
them
are
going
below
with
their
dippers
and
the
rest
of
them
are
to
look
after
handling
the
ship
the
navigation
is
left
to
me
we
get
along
fine
now
provided
the
leaks
do
get
any
worse
freddie
wandered
off
by
himself
to
inspect
the
ship
he
could
walk
very
well
now
in
spite
of
the
roll
of
the
ship
and
he
went
everywhere
he
found
himself
finally
on
the
after
deck
leaning
over
the
rail
and
watching
the
wake
of
the
ship
boiling
away
so
white
and
beautiful
behind
he
was
more
and
more
delighted
with
this
strange
adventure
it
was
too
bad
that
toby
had
forgotten
to
write
the
note
to
his
mother
but
it
could
be
helped
now
and
they
would
sometime
find
a
place
somewhere
or
other
where
they
could
post
a
letter
it
was
so
entrancing
to
be
actually
at
sea
on
a
ship
with
the
deck
rising
and
falling
and
the
wake
boiling
away
behind
and
land
nowhere
in
sight
that
it
would
seem
a
pity
ever
to
arrive
at
the
spanish
main
but
the
thought
of
adventures
there
however
he
was
in
no
hurry
to
have
the
voyage
over
aunt
amanda
was
sitting
somewhere
with
a
pile
of
sailors
socks
in
her
lap
perfectly
contented
hanlon
was
swinging
his
feet
away
up
yonder
from
the
topmost
yard
of
the
second
mast
the
churchwarden
punch
toby
and
the
sly
old
fox
were
engaged
in
an
earnest
discussion
in
chairs
beside
the
the
old
codger
with
the
wooden
leg
was
speaking
confidentially
in
the
ear
of
the
mate
in
an
effort
to
borrow
a
pipeful
of
tobacco
suddenly
freddie
heard
behind
him
the
loud
harsh
laughter
of
marmaduke
the
parrot
turning
round
he
saw
the
parrot
perched
on
the
ship
rail
and
before
him
was
the
shaking
his
finger
in
the
face
and
storming
away
at
him
angrily
freddie
immediately
went
over
to
them
i
it
no
the
was
bawling
his
face
nearly
as
red
as
his
hair
i
do

the

the

sneezed
and
out
came
his
handkerchief
sneezed
the
parrot
and
rubbed
his
beak
with
his
foot
this
was
the
last
straw
the
reached
for
marmaduke
neck
and
would
surely
have
choked
him
then
and
there
if
freddie
had
not
caught
his
arm
and
pulled
him
away
the
allowed
himself
to
be

off

chapter
xiii
the
revenge
it
was
a
soft
moonlight
night
in
southern
seas
our
party
of
adventurers
with
mizzen
in
their
midst
were
sitting
quietly
on
the
after
part
of
the
deck
enjoying
the
balmy
air
and
watching
the
bright
track
which
the
full
moon
made
on
the
water
the
sea
was
very
calm
there
was
only
a
light
breeze
and
the
sieve
was
hardly
moving
mizzen
was
scratching
the
head
of
marmaduke
the
parrot
who
was
perched
on
the
able
seaman
wrist
from
the
forward
part
of
the
deck
where
the
skippers
and
mates
were
sitting
in
a
party
of
their
own
could
be
heard
the
tinkle
of
a
guitar
and
the
sound
of
a
voice
singing
one
always
enjoys
said
punch
a
bit
of
singing
by
moonlight
on
the
water
hi

the
deck
bashfully

he
but

slight
cold
and
besides

while

and
while
the
others
were
talking
freddie
felt
a
hand
on
his
arm
and
looking
down
saw
the
sitting
on
the
deck
beside
his
chair
and
winking
up
at
him
with
a
strange
excited
look
on
his
face
the
pulled
freddie
head
down
and
whispered
in
his
ear
your
eyes
something
going
to
happen
you
see
down
with
and
freddie
gazed
at
the
in
some
alarm
and
was
about
to
ask
a
question
when
mizzen
returned
with
the
guitar
now
we
ready
said
he
taking
his
seat
and
putting
marmaduke
on
the
rail
of
the
ship

mizzen
said
toby
said
mizzen
thrumming
on
his
guitar
what

the
sniffed
and
spoke
in
an
undertone
close
to
freddie
ear

other
of

ear

said
aunt
amanda
ay
ay
said
mizzen
and
after
playing
a
few
chords
and
quivers
on
the
guitar
he
began
to
sing
in
a
voice
like
a
muffled
by
a
heavy
fog
the
following
song
concerning
the
life
and
adventures
of
mizzen
when
i
was
a
lad
i
was
bad
as
i
could
be
would
say
you
nor
not
me
and
at
church
i
would
kneel
but
only
on
one
knee
and
at
school
i
would
study
my
a
b
c
and
i
could
conscientious
with
the
golden
rule
agree
nor
understand
the
secret
of
its
popularitee
nor
get
a
ounce
of
pleasure
from
the
rule
of
three
i
was
bad
right
through
sweared
gee
and
worse
sometimes
like
scrawled
with
a
pencil
on
my
jographee
stole
birds
eggs
in
the
huckleberry
tree
oh
i
was
bad
tried
to
learn
a
flea
how
to
keep
his
balance
on
a
rolling
pea
oh
regular
bad
and
my
ma
said
she
you
do
be
better
than
what
you
be
i
put
you
in
the
cupboard
and
turn
the
key
but
i
would
and
i
would
no
sirree
so
i
ran
away
to
sea
yes
i
ran
away
to
sea
with
a
little
gingham
bottle
of
cambric
tea
and
a
penny
wrapped
up
in
my
hankerchee
for
i
wanted
to
be
free
so
i
ran
away
to
sea
mizzen
stopped
and
looked
towards
the
stern
of
the
ship
i
thought
said
he
i
kind
of
noticed
something
queer
about
the
stern
rail
looked
as
if
it
was
lower
but
i
guess
i
mistaken
everyone
looked
but
saw
nothing
amiss
the
tittered
into
freddie
ear
would
you
like
to
hear
the
second
verse
said
the
able
seaman
yes
yes
go
on
said
several
voices
at
once
here
goes
then
said
mizzen
thrumming
on
the
guitar
after
i
ran
away
to
sea
i
had
a
good
many
adventures
and
some
of
anyway
when
i
was
young
i
followed
the
equator
from
pole
to
pole
in
the
ship
perambulator
a
schooner
a
smoky
old
freighter
loaded
with
sulphur
for
an
old
dead
crater
in
the
andes
mountains
and
a
night
or
two
later
with
a
gale
blowing
loud
and
rude
as
the
dark
grows
darker
and
the
gale
increases
of
a
sudden
we
strike
and
we
goes
all
to
pieces
on
the
parallel
of
latitude
and
then
and
there
we
formed
a
committee
and
went
in
a
body
up
to
london
city
and
walked
up
the
steps
and
pulled
the
little
bell
and
spoke
out
bold
to
the
lords
of
creation
where
they
sat
in
their
wigs
making
rules
of
navigation
and
explained
to
the
dangers
of
the
deadly
parallel
down
and
pull
in
that
the
way
we
did
begin
leaks
nor
is
whiskey
makes
the
sailor
life
so
risky
it
the
parallel
as
lies
acrost
our
track
it
the
deadly
parallel
lying
there
so
long
and
black
is
the
subject
of
our
moderate
petition
is
much
that
we
are
wishin
but
we
humbly
beg
permission
to
implore
coil
up
we
implore
where
they
wo
be
in
the
way
out
of
sight
safe
ashore
we
humbly
pray
for
there
many
a
tidy
bark
strikes
against
in
the
dark
and
is
never
never
heard
of
any
more
so
we
thank
you
heartilee
if
so
very
kind
you
be
and
remove
this
awful
danger
from
the
sea
but
we
could
make
do
it
no
they
simply
would
do
it
and
the
bailiff
shoved
us
gently
from
the
door
and
we
wept
uncommon
salty
for
their
reason
did
seem
faulty
any
way
that
we
could
view
it
and
the
reason
which
they
gave
us
why
they
really
could
save
us
was
because
the
thing
had
been
done
before
no
such
a
thing
had
been
done
before
mizzen
stopped
again
and
looked
along
the
deck
and
up
at
the
masts
and
said
i
ca
get
it
out
of
my
head
that
the
deck
is
slanting
a
little
more
than
usual
the
ship
does
seem
to
come
up
well
at
the
stern
however
would
you
like
to
hear
any
more
of
this
song
everybody
begged
him
to
go
on
the
plucked
freddie
sleeve
i
done
it
you
wo
that
and
that
sing
another
tune
when
they
out
freddie
looked
at
him
in
amazement
but
the
able
seaman
was
commencing
the
third
verse
of
his
song
when
i
was
older
and
bold
as
you
please
i
shipped
on
the
good
ship
firkin
of
cheese
for
a
of
discovery
in
the
far
south
seas
to
gather
up
a
cargo
of
ambergris
that
grows
in
a
cave
on
the
amber
trees
where
the
medicine
men
all
fine
for
the
sake
of
the
usual
medical
fees
crawl
in
by
night
on
their
hands
and
knees
in
a
strictly
ethical
manner
to
seize
the
amber
fruit
that
is
used
to
grease
the
itching
palm
in
shekel
disease
on
a
long
long
as
busy
as
bees
never
stopping
for
a
moment
to
take
our
ease
never
changing
our
course
except
when
the
breeze
took
to
blowing
to
windward
we
had
slipped
by
degrees
down
the
oozy
slopes
of
the
hebrides
and
passed
through
the
locks
of
the
florida
keys
which
in
getting
through
was
a
rather
tight
squeeze
but
danger
is
nothing
to
men
like
these
when
suddenly
the
lookout
a
portuguese
who
had
better
been
below
peas
shrieked
out
are
coming
by
twos
and
threes
on
the
starboard
bow
we
are
lost
we
lost
we
lost
we
lost
came
a
terrible
cry
from
the
forward
part
of
the
ship
as
if
in
echo
of
mizzen
song
lost
the
dippers
the
dippers
everyone
jumped
up
even
aunt
amanda
the
whispered
in
freddie
ear
in
great
excitement
you
a
man
came
running
down
the
deck
followed
by
all
the
skippers
and
mates
as
he
halted
before
mizzen
he
was
evidently
the
cook
by
the
white
cook
cap
he
wore
on
his
head
he
took
off
his
cap
and
wiped
his
forehead
with
his
hand
he
was
in
a
state
of
mixed
alarm
and
anger
we
lost
he
cried
and
actually
tore
his
hair
with
his
hands
that
rascally

dippers

last
one
of
them
and
the
ship

last
dipper

we
lost
everyone
looked
around
for
the
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
but
his
laugh
was
heard
overhead
and
his
face
was
then
seen
looking
down
from
the
rigging
just
above
i
it
he
cried
shrieking
with
laughter
i
even
with
you
he
the
parrot

down
to
the
bottom
of
the
bottom
of
the
he
laughed
louder
than
before
and
the
angry
cook
sprang
forward
to
climb
up
after
him
but
just
then
the
ship
gave
a
violent
lurch
backwards
nearly
upsetting
everyone
and
settled
down
by
the
stern
so
that
that
end
of
the
boat
was
completely
under
water
aunt
amanda
screamed
toby
and
punch
came
to
her
at
once
and
supported
her
on
each
side
there
was
a
great
hubbub
everyone
tried
to
speak
at
once
freddie
felt
his
hand
grasped
in
the
strong
hand
of
toby
and
he
began
to
feel
somewhat
less
afraid
over
the
hubbub
could
be
heard
the
wild
laugh
everybody
quiet
shouted
mizzen
we
must
think
what
we
had
better
do
yes
yes
cried
a
number
of
voices
what
are
we
going
to
do
i
wish
said
mizzen
thoughtfully
i
wish
we
had
thought
to
bring
a
rowboat
with
us
what
cried
aunt
amanda
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
came
away
on
this
long
journey
without
an
extra
boat
we
did
think
of
it
said
mizzen
we
had
plenty
of
dippers
and
we
never
thought
of
anybody
throwing
them
overboard
no
no
cried
all
the
skippers
and
mates
together
we
never
thought
of
that
then
bring
out
the
at
once
said
aunt
amanda
and
be
quick
about
it
we
have
any
said
mizzen
what
would
have
been
the
use
of
if
the
dippers
were
all
on
board
we
never
thought
we
would
need
them
no
no
cried
all
the
skippers
and
mates
together
we
never
thought
of
that
then
think
of
something
now
said
aunt
amanda
do
you
see
the
ship
settling
deeper
in
the
water
the
ship
was
in
fact
deeper
in
the
water
it
was
sinking
rapidly
the
deck
began
to
list
so
much
towards
the
stern
that
it
was
difficult
to
stand
on
it
the
ship
was
making
no
headway
whatever
the
breeze
was
even
lighter
than
before
and
the
sails
were
hanging
limp
it
would
have
taken
a
stiff
wind
indeed
to
have
moved
that
boat
and
it
lay
as
if
moored
to
a
float
going
up
and
down
heavily
in
the
long
swell
do
you
er
think
said
the
old
codger
with
the
wooden
leg
that
we
are
in
er
danger
danger
cried
aunt
amanda
something
must
be
done
are
you
going
to
let
us
drown
without
turning
a
hand
there
only
one
thing
to
do
said
mizzen
and
i
do
know
whether
it
will
work
or
not
but
we
can
try
it
boys
bring
up
all
the
mattresses
from
the
cabins
and
a
coil
of
rope
look
alive
now
the
skippers
and
mates
ran
off
in
great
haste
and
disappeared
down
the
hatchways
in
a
few
minutes
they
had
laid
on
the
deck
a
great
pile
of
mattresses
while
this
was
being
done
aunt
amanda
whose
bonnet
and
shawl
had
been
brought
to
her
by
one
of
the
men
tied
her
under
her
chin
and
put
her
shawl
about
her
shoulders
in
readiness
for
departure
now
then
said
mizzen
lash
the
mattresses
together
the
men
proved
themselves
very
handy
with
ropes
with
mizzen
help
they
lashed
together
securely
a
good
number
of
the
mattresses
and
the
first
result
of
their
work
was
a
mattress
raft
some
fifteen
feet
square
and
some
four
or
five
feet
thick
a
supply
of
was
found
in
the
and
this
was
bound
by
ropes
all
over
and
under
and
around
the
raft
i
do
know
whether
it
will
do
said
mizzen
but
anyway
nothing
else
that
do
now
lads
over
the
side
with
her
all
the
men
lent
a
hand
and
the
mattress
raft
was
hoisted
over
the
side
and
on
to
the
water
to
the
satisfaction
of
everyone
it
floated
there
quietly
and
easily
with
its
top
well
above
the
surface
of
the
sea
lucky
it
a
smooth
sea
said
mizzen
we
ought
to
be
pleased
with
the
state
of
the
weather
could
be
better
i
feel
quite
joyful
about
it
oh
you
do
said
aunt
amanda
well
i
do
feel
joyful
about
it
what
next
put
the
provisions
aboard
said
the
able
seaman
whereupon
some
of
the
men
placed
on
the
raft
a
small
barrel
of
water
and
some
tins
of
meat
soup
biscuit
and
other
things
if
you
please
said
mizzen
when
this
had
been
done
i
think
the
passengers
had
better
get
aboard
when
you
aboard
we
make
another
raft
for
ourselves
are
you
ready
the
passengers
were
helped
aboard
the
raft
one
after
another
although
the
raft
bobbed
up
and
down
on
the
swell
it
was
not
a
difficult
matter
for
the
men
and
the
boy
to
get
on
for
it
was
held
fast
against
the
side
of
the
ship
at
a
point
where
it
was
about
even
with
the
freddie
gave
a
good
spring
and
was
on
in
no
time
hanlon
who
did
not
seem
in
the
least
uneasy
got
aboard
with
the
agility
of
a
cat
there
was
no
trouble
with
anyone
except
aunt
amanda
whose
lameness
impeded
her
movements
a
good
deal
as
the
sly
old
fox
with
his
high
silk
hat
on
his
head
was
about
to
step
over
the
side
he
turned
and
said
i
feel
it
my
duty
mizzen
to
register
a
complaint
against
the
outrageous
treatment
to
which
we
are
being
subjected
i
submit
under
protest
sir
under
protest
if
i
had
for
one
moment
imagined
oh
bosh
said
toby
push
him
over
mizzen
and
the
sly
old
fox
was
in
fact
somewhat
rudely
pushed
over
on
to
the
raft
none
of
the
others
made
any
objection
punch
who
usually
talked
a
good
deal
was
noticeably
silent
and
when
toby
offered
him
a
hand
to
help
him
over
he
said
stiffly
hi
thank
you
sir
but
i
do
not
require
any
hassistance
when
the
churchwarden
took
his
seat
in
the
middle
of
the
raft
it
went
down
alarmingly
but
nothing
happened
and
when
the
old
codger
with
the
wooden
leg
was
aboard
the
party
was
complete
all
the
others
sat
around
the
churchwarden
as
close
as
they
could
huddle
it
was
evident
that
the
raft
would
float
them
at
least
until
it
should
become
or
a
gale
of
wind
should
blow
the
men
on
the
ship
now
let
go
of
the
raft
and
proceeded
to
lash
together
the
remaining
mattresses
for
themselves
the
raft
floated
quietly
away
from
the
ship
aunt
amanda
arm
was
about
freddie
he
did
not
feel
however
that
he
needed
her
protection
he
had
already
forgotten
his
first
alarm
and
he
was
feeling
most
of
all
what
an
extraordinary
adventure
it
was
that
had
befallen
him
the
men
from
the
ship
would
be
nearby
on
the
other
rafts
the
sea
was
calm
the
air
was
warm
and
they
would
probably
be
picked
up
by
some
vessel
before
the
food
gave
out
he
supposed
there
were
very
few
boys
who
had
ever
sailed
the
open
sea
on
a
mattress
well
freddie
said
toby
as
the
raft
continued
to
float
slowly
away
from
the
ship

most
addlepated
exasperating
oh

the
ship
quick
the
party
on
the
raft
set
up
a
loud
cry
which
was
answered
from
the
ship
the
chinaman
head
shouted
toby
on
the
dresser
in
my
cabin
i
forgot
it
run
and
get
it
quick
we
floating
away
ay
ay
sir
came
a
voice
from
the
ship
the
company
on
the
raft
waited
anxiously
in
a
very
few
moments
which
seemed
like
a
great
many
a
hail
came
from
the
side
of
the
ship
and
they
could
see
the
standing
at
a
point
of
the
deck
where
it
was
now
sloped
high
out
of
the
water
and
he
was
holding
the
head
aloft
in
both
hands
as
if
about
to
throw
it
towards
the
raft
do
throw
it
shouted
toby
tie
a
rope
to
it
first
but
he
was
too
late
the
raised
the
chinaman
head
higher
swinging
his
body
sideways
and
as
a
dark
figure
came
up
behind
him
and
tried
to
seize
his
arm
he
gave
a
mighty
heave
and
toss
and
sent
the
chinaman
head
flying
through
the
air
in
the
direction
of
the
raft
for
a
second
it
glistened
in
the
moonlight
in
another
second
it
descended
towards
the
raft
and
almost
reached
it
but
not
quite
it
came
down
within
five
feet
of
it
and
fell
like
a
shot
plump
into
the
ocean
it
splashed
and
that
was
all
the
chinaman
head
was
gone
a
wail
went
up
from
the
company
on
the
raft
at
this
terrible
disaster
how
terrible
it
really
was
they
did
not
even
yet
understand
but
they
were
soon
to
learn
freddie
was
almost
ready
to
burst
into
tears
aunt
amanda
was
so
exasperated
that
she
could
scarcely
speak
the
others
seemed
to
be
stupefied
oh
oh
oh
cried
aunt
amanda
you
toby
you
now
you
done
it
for
good
why
why
ca
you
never
remember
anything
it
your
fault
and
do
you
never
try
to
lay
it
to
that
and
now
what
we
do
if
we
ever
get
separated
from
mizzen
how
we
ever
call
him
up
to
help
us
out
of
trouble
if
we
get
into
it
here
a
pretty
kettle
of
fish
now
ai
it
i
hope
and
pray
we
can
stick
close
to
mizzen
until
we
all
safe
and
look
there
cried
punch
bless
me
heyes
what
do
i
see
look
at
the
ship
it
was
high
time
to
look
at
the
ship
no
sooner
had
the
chinaman
head
disappeared
into
the
depths
of
the
ocean
than
a
change
began
to
come
over
the
ship
it
grew
paler
and
thinner
in
the
moonlight
the
green
shutters
along
the
side
faded
away
one
by
one
the
dark
hull
became
lighter
the
sails
grew
so
thin
that
at
last
the
watchers
could
see
the
stars
shining
through
them
the
whole
ship
seemed
to
waver
and
dissolve
into
a
pale
mist
it
did
not
sink
no
the
bow
was
still
high
out
of
the
water
and
all
the
masts
and
sails
were
visible
it
simply
faded
away
where
it
stood
as
it
was
becoming
more
and
more
vague
the
voice
of
marmaduke
the
parrot
came
across
the
water
out
of
the
rigging
a
voice
which
grew
fainter
and
fainter
as
the
ship
grew
dimmer
until
it
died
away
as
if
in
the
distance
it
said
for
and
onions
and
as
marmaduke
voice
died
away
the
ship
dissolved
like
a
pale
ghost
and
vanished
the
sieve
was
gone
the
party
of
adventurers
sat
on
their
mattress
raft
in
the
midst
of
the
wide
ocean
with
never
a
ship
to
be
seen
the
long
rolled
placidly
over
the
place
where
their
ship
had
been
they
sat
huddled
together
in
silence
around
the
churchwarden
too
horrified
to
speak
a
word
the
moon
glistened
on
the
sly
old

his
head
against
aunt

shoulder
as
he
was
falling
off
to
sleep
a
slim
dark
object
rose
from
the
sea

across
the
ocean

plopped
into

opportunity
to
improve
the
mind
my
little
friend

trust

is
very
educational
very
educational

the
old
codger
with
the
wooden
leg
what
do

suppose
er
ahem
if
you
will
pardon
me
what
are
those
little
things

surface
of
the
water

a
school
of
sardines
said
punch
hi

wery
well
when
i
was
a
lad
there
must
be
millions
of
them
said
freddie
just
look
the
tiny
fish
were
leaping
by
thousands
on
the
surface
of
the
water
immediately
in
the
path
of
moonlight
and
they
flashed
and
sparkled
as
they
leaped
hi
believe
there
a
great
fish
arfter
them
said
punch
maybe
a
whole
regiment
of
big
fish
said
toby
by
crackey
one
now
as
he
spoke
a
black
fin
cut
the
water
near
the
sardines
and
they
became
more
agitated
than
ever
from
the
size
of
the
fin
it
must
have
been
a
very
great
fish
indeed
and
along
the
upper
edge
of
the
fin
was
a
row
of
long
sharp
looking
big
and
strong
enough
to
have
sawed
through
a
wooden
plank
there
another
one
cried
freddie
and
another
and
another
cried
aunt
amanda
there
must
have
been
five
or
six
of
the
great
fish
i
hope
they
wo
come
near
this
boat
said
toby
one
of
would
just
about
turn
us
upside
down
if
he
struck
us
mercy
said
aunt
amanda
do
say
such
a
terrible
thing
at
that
moment
a
great
round
black
back
appeared
above
the
surface
of
the
water
some
hundred
yards
or
so
away
and
in
another
moment
a
great
black
blunt
head
joined
itself
to
the
back
and
a
spout
of
white
vapor
rose
from
the
head
a
whale
cried
several
voices
at
once
oh
said
aunt
amanda
suppose
he
should
come
this
way
the
five
or
six
fins
of
the
great
fish
near
the
sardines
now
disappeared
the
whale
threw
up
his
enormous
tail
and
went
down
head
first
beneath
the
water
almost
immediately
one
of
the
fins
reappeared
much
nearer
the
raft
than
before
merciful
heavens
cried
aunt
amanda
he
coming
towards
us
oh
dear
the
great
fish
was
in
fact
evidently
making
straight
towards
the
raft
freddie
clutched
aunt
amanda
arm
the
fin
cut
the
water
at
a
high
speed
it
disappeared
at
times
but
on
each
reappearance
it
was
still
pointed
towards
the
raft
he
nearly
on
us
cried
aunt
amanda
hold
on
tight
freddie
the
great
fish
came
on
with
a
rush
and
as
he
reached
the
raft
struck
it
with
his
back
and
slid
under
it
there
was
a
tremendous
bump
which
nearly
sent
the
company
flat
then
there
was
a
rubbing
under
the
raft
and
everything
was
quiet
again
he
gone
said
toby
no
is
said
punch
look
at
tail
a
great
tail
could
be
seen
beyond
the
edge
of
the
raft
just
below
the
surface
of
the
water
it
thrashed
about
and
churned
up
the
water
violently
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
waved
back
and
forth
quietly
but
it
did
not
disappear
by
crackey
said
toby
he
stuck
his
fin
has
got
stuck
into
the
bottom
of
the
raft
he
got
the
whole
kit
and
bilin
of
us
on
his
back
mercy
on
us
said
aunt
amanda
is
it
really
true
said
freddie
on
due
consideration
said
the
churchwarden
i
think
toby
right
hi
believe
is
said
punch
blimy
if
i
ever
rode
on
the
back
of
a
fish
before
now
got
us
on
back
what
going
to
do
with
us
we
moving
cried
freddie
so
we
are
said
aunt
amanda
blamed
if
we
ai
said
toby
the
mattress
craft
was
in
fact
moving
very
slowly
indeed
but
still
moving
and
it
was
moving
in
the
opposite
direction
to
the
fish
tail
which
could
be
seen
now
and
then
under
the
water
waving
back
and
forth
like
the
tail
of
a
swimming
fish
if
this
do
beat
all
said
toby
that
fish
down
there
has
certainly
got
his
fin
hooked
into
our
mattress
and
he
swimming
along
with
us
on
top
of
him
i
seen
a
snail
crawlin
with
his
shell
on
top
of
him
but
a
fish
with
a
load
of
mattresses
and
is
a
new
thing
to
me
i
the
captain
said
aunt
amanda
and
my
orders
is
to
sit
as
still
as
you
can
and
see
where
he
taking
us
to
ay
ay
sir
said
the
churchwarden
i
mean
ay
ay
the
party
huddled
on
top
of
the
mattresses
sat
as
still
as
mice
hardly
daring
to
breathe
their
little
craft
continued
to
move
gently
through
the
water
they
expected
each
moment
that
the
fish
would
free
himself
but
evidently
his
fin
had
embedded
itself
so
firmly
in
one
of
the
bottom
mattresses
that
he
could
not
get
loose
he
went
on
swimming
with
his
load
on
his
back
hour
after
hour
they
waited
to
feel
their
craft
stop
but
hour
after
hour
it
moved
gently
and
slowly
across
the
surface
of
the
sea
they
settled
themselves
more
comfortably
against
each
other
and
spoke
very
little
no
one
noticed
that
their
raft
was
now
much
lower
in
the
water
the
air
was
warm
the
moonlight
and
the
silence
were
extremely
soothing
and
the
motion
of
the
raft
was
gentle
and
languorous
freddie
head
sank
against
aunt
amanda
shoulder
and
his
eyes
closed
and
in
another
moment
he
was
asleep
aunt
amanda
herself
nodded
and
her
eyes
closed
she
was
asleep
too
toby
yawned
and
leaned
heavily
against
the
sly
old
codger
his
eyes
closed
and
in
short
every
eye
closed
and
every
frame
relaxed
heavily
against
its
neighbor
and
at
last
doubled
over
in
a
closely
huddled
group
in
the
exact
center
of
their
mattresses
the
whole
party
slept
each
and
every
one
the
raft
went
on
steadily
and
quietly
through
the
water
the
moon
glittered
on
the
sea
the
raft
settled
deeper
and
deeper
and
there
was
absolute
silence
on
the
ocean
except
for
a
slight
groan
which
came
regularly
and
gently
from
the
nose
of
the
churchwarden
chapter
xv
a
fall
in
the
dark
freddie
was
the
first
to
be
awake
in
the
morning
he
was
cramped
and
stiff
he
sat
up
straight
rubbed
his
eyes
and
stretched
his
arms
he
looked
abroad
and
the
sight
which
met
him
caused
him
to
grasp
aunt
amanda
hand
in
excitement
land
he
cried
so
loud
that
everyone
awoke
blamed
if
it
ai
said
toby
and
put
on
his
white
derby
hat
considering
that
he
had
thereby
dressed
himself
for
the
day
all
the
others
sat
bolt
upright
and
stared
across
the
smooth
blue
sea
sparkling
in
the
sunlight
not
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
rose
a
tall
black
cliff
straight
up
out
of
the
water
it
stretched
away
on
either
hand
for
miles
and
miles
and
came
to
an
end
in
the
ocean
at
the
right
hand
and
the
left
so
that
it
was
probably
the
side
of
an
island
the
sea
rolled
up
and
down
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
making
a
beautiful
white
splash
against
the
rocks
but
how
on
earth
said
aunt
amanda
are
we
ever
to
get
ashore
on
such
a
place
as
that
we
moving
towards
it
said
freddie
blamed
if
we
ai
said
toby
we
soon
know
whether
we
can
get
ashore
or
not
they
moved
very
slowly
and
it
was
a
long
time
before
they
came
close
enough
to
the
cliff
to
see
what
their
chances
of
a
landing
might
be
they
floated
at
last
within
two
or
three
hundred
yards
of
the
cliff
it
was
very
dangerous
looking
the
waves
rolled
over
huge
black
rocks
at
its
foot
and
broke
in
white
foam
against
its
side
it
seemed
the
last
place
in
the
world
for
a
landing
a
great
swell
rolled
in
from
the
sea
and
brought
them
nearer
the
breakers
my
word
cried
punch
excitedly
there
a
harch
a
what
said
toby
see
said
aunt
amanda
there
a
little
archway
in
the
rock
like
the
mouth
of
a
cave
over
there
to
the
right
do
you
see
with
the
water
pouring
in
over
there
it
was
true
there
was
an
archway
like
the
mouth
of
a
cave
and
into
this
the
water
was
streaming
in
a
strong
current
making
a
kind
of
more
or
less
smooth
through
the
breakers
yes
said
freddie
and
i
believe
we
headed
towards
it
their
course
changed
a
little
to
the
right
as
if
the
fish
who
was
piloting
them
had
now
taken
a
correct
bearing
they
found
themselves
in
a
passage
through
the
breakers
where
the
water
swirled
in
towards
the
arch
they
were
caught
in
this
current
and
were
swept
to
a
point
close
under
the
towering
black
rocks
and
in
another
moment
they
were
directly
before
the
opening
the
current
seized
the
raft
as
if
with
strong
hands
and
drew
it
in
they
were
in
a
cavern
narrow
and
high
whose
interior
was
lost
in
darkness
the
current
carried
them
onward
into
the
dark
the
roar
of
the
breakers
suddenly
ceased
and
as
they
looked
behind
them
the
archway
was
no
more
than
a
speck
of
light
their
raft
turned
slightly
to
the
left
and
at
that
moment
the
speck
of
light
disappeared
as
if
they
had
turned
a
corner
and
the
darkness
became
so
black
that
no
one
could
see
even
the
person
sitting
next
to
him
i
wonder
said
toby
if
there
are
any
matches
and
candles
on
board
this
boat
i
going
to
see
he
was
silent
for
a
while
and
it
was
evident
from
the
tilting
of
the
raft
that
he
had
moved
his
position
finally
he
said
ah
and
a
match
spluttered
and
went
out
in
the
breeze
which
was
blowing
past
them
but
after
it
went
out
there
remained
a
glimmer
and
toby
was
holding
up
a
lighted
candle
and
shielding
it
from
the
draught
with
his
hand
found
in
the
tin
with
the
biscuits
said
toby
he
held
the
candle
on
high
so
that
its
little
beam
searched
out
the
darkness
in
front
and
on
both
sides
they
were
in
a
narrow
on
each
side
was
a
wall
of
solid
rock
not
ten
feet
beyond
the
edge
of
the
raft
how
high
the
wall
was
they
could
not
tell
for
it
was
lost
in
the
darkness
overhead
they
were
slipping
along
a
narrow
of
water
toby
held
the
candle
higher
and
everyone
peered
into
the
darkness
ahead
but
it
was
impossible
to
see
more
than
a
few
yards
i
wish
it
distinctly
understood
said
the
sly
old
codger
that
i
am
here
under
never
mind
said
aunt
amanda
my
orders
as
captain
is
to
say
nothing
and
wait
and
see
what
will
happen
the
raft
turned
a
corner
to
the
right
and
slipped
on
silently
in
that
direction
for
a
long
distance
probably
for
more
than
a
mile
then
the
raft
turned
again
this
time
to
the
left
and
after
about
ten
minutes
longer
toby
suddenly
said
what
that
they
all
listened
and
heard
afar
off
a
sound
as
of
rushing
water
very
faint
but
unmistakable
er
excuse
me
said
the
old
codger
with
the
wooden
leg
do
you
think
ahem
there
is
any
er
i
do
like
it
said
aunt
amanda
i
do
think
it
safe
in
here
i
think
we
are
lower
in
the
water
said
freddie
so
we
are
said
toby
the
water
coming
up
over
the
top
now
and
if
we
do
get
on
dry
land
soon
we
all
be
sitting
in
a
puddle
in
spite
of
its
being
and
lower
in
the
water
the
raft
was
beginning
to
go
faster
for
the
current
had
suddenly
become
swifter
the
wind
blew
stronger
it
swept
through
the
narrow
so
briskly
that
toby
put
his
hat
over
the
candle
but
he
was
too
late
the
light
wavered
and
went
out
a
groan
went
up
from
the
company
i
can
hear
that
rushing
sound
plainer
said
aunt
amanda
hit
wery
like
a
said
punch
i
wish
it
understood
said
the
sly
old
fox
distinctly
understood
that
i
am
here
under
protest
if
i
had
ever
for
one
moment
imagined
screamed
aunt
amanda
we
going
faster
she
threw
her
arm
around
freddie
and
held
him
tight
the
current
suddenly
became
swifter
the
raft
almost
under
water
was
leaping
forward
at
a
frightful
speed
directly
ahead
of
them
growing
louder
and
louder
was
the
roar
of
rushing
water
hold
on
tight
freddie
cried
aunt
amanda
we
all
be
done
for
shouted
toby
in
another
minute
i
reckon
hold
on
tight
as
toby
said
this
the
raft
almost
galloped
the
roar
of
falling
water
burst
on
them
from
close
ahead
the
raft
seemed
to
rise
up
and
then
to
sink
down
its
nose
slanted
downward
the
roar
of
falling
water
was
all
about
them
aunt
amanda
screamed
but
no
one
could
hear
her
the
raft
paused
and
teetered
for
an
instant
then
it
pointed
downward
almost
straight
and
the
whole
party
the
raft
and
the
fish
under
the
raft
plunged
downward
through
the
darkness
on
a
cascade
of
tumbling
water
down
down
down
the
raft
shot
from
under
and
the
passengers
shot
off
in
a
twinkling
they
were
going
down
the
on
their
backs
would
they
never
reach
the
bottom
there
did
not
seem
to
be
any
bottom
but
in
another
moment
there
were
aunt
amanda
and
freddie
her
arm
still
about
him
standing
on
their
feet
in
about
inches
of
quiet
water
on
a
solid
bottom
dark
forms
appeared
one
after
another
beside
them
and
almost
at
once
all
the
party
were
standing
together
in
a
group
in
about
two
feet
of
quiet
water
on
a
solid
bottom
i
fear
said
the
voice
of
the
sly
old
codger
that
i
have
lost
my
hat
they
could
see
that
they
were
in
a
great
chamber
whose
walls
they
could
make
out
dimly
on
each
side
they
could
not
see
the
top
of
the
but
they
could
see
its
lower
part
very
plainly
through
the
tumbling
water
of
the
fall
near
the
bottom
sunlight
was
shining
behind
the
water
was
an
opening
some
six
feet
high
and
as
the
water
fell
across
this
opening
the
sunlight
from
without
shone
through
it
making
it
glow
with
green
and
sparkle
with
white
the
hung
over
this
opening
like
a
curtain
well
said
aunt
amanda
i
pretty
near
drowned
and
my
clothes
are
a
sight
to
behold
but
i
the
captain
of
this
expedition
and
my
orders
is
that
we
go
ashore
the
water
proved
to
be
shallow
all
about
them
and
they
waded
to
a
strip
of
dry
ground
beside
the
wall
which
rose
at
their
left
as
they
faced
the
fall
aunt
amanda
whose
cane
was
gone
was
assisted
by
toby
and
punch
blamed
if
my
hat
ai
gone
too
said
toby
she
was
a
good
hat
have
to
say
that
for
her
the
party
walked
along
the
edge
of
the
water
and
came
to
the
end
wall
of
the
chamber
opposite
the
fall
there
lay
the
wreck
of
the
raft
with
the
tail
of
the
great
fish
sticking
out
from
beneath
i
fear
said
the
sly
old
codger
that
the
faithful
creature
has
departed
this
life
he
dead
as
a
doornail
said
toby
poor
thing
said
aunt
amanda
anyway
my
orders
is
to
explore
this
cavern
and
see
what
we
can
find
at
this
end
of
the
cavern
the
water
was
slipping
away
under
the
wall
and
this
outlet
explained
why
the
water
inside
remained
so
shallow
the
party
commented
on
it
and
then
walked
along
the
side
wall
towards
the
other
end
where
the
fall
was
when
they
were
midway
along
this
wall
a
cry
from
toby
who
had
left
aunt
amanda
to
the
care
of
punch
startled
the
others
what
this
he
cried
look
here
he
was
stooping
over
something
and
as
the
others
gathered
round
they
saw
that
he
was
stooping
over
a
pile
of
small
square
boxes
standing
in
several
long
rows
along
the
wall
hanlon
lifted
one
of
the
boxes
with
a
great
effort
and
shook
it
a
jingling
sound
came
from
within
aha
said
the
sly
old
fox
that
beautiful
music

is
the
sound

sound
of
of

soul
cried
aunt
amanda

opinion

said
the
churchwarden
that
there
is
gold
in
that
box
then
open
it
said
aunt
amanda
hanlon
shook
his
head
the
box
was
locked
tight
and
it
was
bound
with
iron
bands
all
the
boxes
were
locked
and
they
were
all
bound
with
iron
bands
come
along
this
way
said
toby
there
something
more
here
further
along
the
wall
leaning
against
it
was
a
row
of
large
each
bound
around
the
mouth
by
strong
twine
one
of
these
sacks
hanlon
quickly
opened
he
tilted
it
over
and
poured
out
its
contents
on
the
ground
the
party
of
onlookers
gasped
with
astonishment
from
the
mouth
of
the
bag

vases
and
a
great
variety
of
other
things
of
the
same
sort
it
was
a
moment
or
two
before
anyone
spoke
then
the
churchwarden
said
it
my
opinion
that
this
is
pirates
treasure
mercy
on
us
said
aunt
amanda
and
they
may
be
in
here
on
us
any
minute
hanlon
opened
others
of
the
bags
each
was
filled
with
rare
and
costly
articles
of
gold
silver
and
precious
stones
do
you
think
it
really
pirates
said
freddie
in
an
awed
whisper
not
a
doubt
of
it
said
toby
in
a
voice
much
lower
than
before
look
at
this
he
pointed
to
a
placard
on
the
wall
above
the
sacks
the
light
was
almost
too
dim
for
reading
but
the
writing
on
the
placard
was
very
large
and
toby
by
standing
on
one
of
the
bags
was
able
to
make
it
out
he
read
it
aloud
beware
hands
off
whoever
shall
touch
it
he
shall
die
by
the
hand
of
lingo
with
a
knife
in
the
throat
long
live
king
james
and
the
jolly
roger
there
a
skull
and
under
it
said
toby
pirates
as
sure
as
you
born
we
better
be
getting
away
from
here
said
aunt
amanda
better
not
speak
so
loud
said
toby
how
are
we
to
said
the
old
codger
with
the
wooden
leg
in
a
frightened
whisper
excuse
me
look
i
saw
something
under
the
that
stand
close
back
against
the
wall
whispered
toby
and
do
speak
a
word
they
crowded
back
against
the
wall
alongside
of
the
treasure
and
looked
towards
the
a
dark
object
was
rising
from
the
shallow
water
at
the
foot
of
the
fall
as
they
watched
another
dark
object
appeared
to
come
through
from
under
the
fall
and
apparently
from
behind
it
and
this
object
rose
also
from
the
shallow
water
near
the
foot
of
the
fall
and
took
its
place
beside
the
other
one
after
another
five
more
of
these
dark
objects
came
from
under
the
fall
and
apparently
from
behind
it
and
stood
upright
in
the
shallow
water
there
were
now
seven
in
all
they
moved
in
a
group
towards
the
shore
each
of
them
had
two
legs
and
each
was
muffled
from
top
to
toe
in
a
single
loose
garment
with
baggy
legs
they
walked
somewhat
like
a
company
of
bears
they
stood
on
the
dry
ground
and
one
of
them
proceeded
to
take
off
the
loose
garment
with
which
he
was
muffled
while
the
others
assisted
him
with
evident
deference
first
came
off
a
close
hood
which
covered
his
head
cheeks
and
neck
as
the
watchers
by
the
wall
saw
his
head
they
held
their
breath
in
terror
and
aunt
amanda
clutched
freddie
arm
around
the
head
was
a
kerchief
knotted
behind
in
his
ears
were
great
round
and
gripped
between
his
teeth
was
a
long
pointed
knife
aunt
amanda
gave
a
sign
as
if
she
was
about
to
scream
but
toby
quickly
put
his
hand
over
her
mouth
as
the
man
with
the
got
himself
out
of
the
legs
of
his
loose
garment
the
party
by
the
wall
saw
that
he
was
a
short
and
burly
man
of
a
ferocious
aspect
in
a
sash
which
he
wore
was
stuck
on
one
side
a
cutlass
and
on
the
other
a
long
pistol
he
wore
no
coat
and
his
shirt
was
open
at
the
throat
his
arms
showed
from
the
elbows
down
and
they
were
thick
with
muscles
his
trousers
were
knee
breeches
buckled
just
below
the
knee
and
he
was
very
his
calves
were
big
and
knotted
when
his
outer
covering
had
been
removed
it
was
plain
that
he
was
perfectly
dry
from
head
to
foot
except
for
water
on
his
face
and
hands
and
while
the
others
were
taking
off
their
coverings
he
withdrew
with
one
hand
the
knife
from
between
his
teeth
and
with
the
other
hand
wiped
the
water
from
his
eyes
and
face
he
then
stuck
the
knife
in
his
sash
waved
his
hands
somewhat
daintily
in
the
air
as
if
to
dry
them
took
from
his
breeches
pocket
a
large
white
handkerchief
completed
with
this
handkerchief
the
drying
of
his
face
and
hands
examined
his
carefully
blew
on
them
and
proceeded
to
polish
them
delicately
with
his
at
the
same
time
swearing
two
dreadful
oaths
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
at
the
six
men
who
were
struggling
with
their
coverings
when
these
had
been
removed
the
six
appeared
in
much
the
same
style
of
dress
as
the
first
and
each
bore
a
cutlass
and
a
pistol
but
their
clothing
was
much
ruder
than
his
and
they
had
no
instead
of
sashes
they
wore
leather
belts
kerchoo
rang
out
a
sneeze
as
sharp
as
a
from
the
party
by
the
wall
dear
me
said
the
sly
old
codger
out
loud
i
do
believe
i
catching
cold
at
the
sudden
discharge
of
the
sneeze
the
seven
men
jumped
as
if
they
had
in
fact
been
shot
each
one
snatched
out
his
cutlass
with
his
right
hand
and
his
pistol
with
his
left
and
faced
in
the
direction
of
the
sneeze
confound
your
cold
whispered
toby
fiercely
to
the
sly
old
codger
now
we
done
for
the
seven
men
with
their
cutlasses
and
pistols
with
the
man
in
the
lead
tiptoed
stealthily
in
the
direction
of
the
sneeze
as
they
came
closer
to
the
party
who
were
crouched
against
the
wall
aunt
amanda
slipped
down
quietly
to
the
ground
at
toby
feet
the
captain
of
the
expedition
had
fainted
chapter
xvi
captain
lingo
and
a
fine
piece
of
the
man
with
the
muttered
something
in
a
fierce
undertone
to
his
six
followers
they
spread
out
behind
him
in
a
wide
line
with
a
stealthy
step
they
came
forward
noiselessly
the
party
by
the
wall
held
their
breath
in
terror
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
seven
men
still
in
perfect
silence
they
reached
the
cowering
company
by
the
wall
leveled
their
pistols
at
their
breasts
held
up
their
cutlasses
ready
to
strike
and
looked
at
their
leader
for
the
command
to
kill
at
this
moment
the
man
with
the
observed
the
form
of
aunt
amanda
on
the
ground
he
stooped
down
and
examined
her
and
stood
up
again
then
he
eyed
the
company
of
travellers
with
a
hard
cold
eye
and
spoke
deliberately
and
in
a
low
voice
his
manner
of
speech
was
somewhat
stilted
and
precise
and
scarcely
what
might
have
been
expected
of
a
pirate
the
ceremony
said
he
will
be
deferred
for
the
moment
i
commend
you
meanwhile
to
perfect
quietness
one
movement
and
the
consequences
may
be
fatal
a
hint
is
sufficient
i
perceive
here
a
lady
in
distress
is
a
monstrous
pity
indeed
i
regret
that
we
were
unaware
of
the
presence
of
a
lady
had
we
known
we
should
certainly
have
taken
our
measures
more
fittingly
i
crave
your
pardon
no
one
has
yet
accused
captain
lingo
of
rudeness
to
a
lady
ketch
put
up
thy
cutlass
and
go
straightway
to
the
pool
and
wet
this
be
brisk
thou
son
of
a
haste
the
man
called
ketch
jumped
as
though
he
had
been
stung
and
took
from
captain
lingo
hand
a
fine
white
cambric
handkerchief
which
the
captain
had
produced
from
his
breeches
pocket
and
running
to
the
water
moistened
it
and
returned
in
great
haste
while
this
was
going
on
the
poor
captives
were
able
to
examine
their
chief
captor
more
carefully
they
remarked
with
surprise
the
fine
quality
of
the
handkerchief
which
he
had
handed
to
his
man
and
they
were
even
more
surprised
to
note
the
whiteness
and
fineness
of
the
linen
of
his
shirt
his
breeches
were
of
blue
velvet
and
his
sash
and
the
kerchief
which
bound
his
head
were
of
crimson
silk
on
the
fingers
of
each
hand
he
wore
three
or
four
diamond
rings
which
sparkled
brilliantly
in
the
his
stockings
were
plainly
of
silk
and
the
buckles
at
his
knees
and
on
his
shoes
were
of
polished
silver
outlined
in
diamonds
his
face
was
hard
and
cruel
but
its
unpleasantness
may
have
been
due
to
a
long
scar
which
crossed
his
mouth
from
his
right
cheek
to
his
chin
when
he
smiled
as
he
did
in
referring
to
the
lady
in
distress
the
scar
gave
to
his
face
a
singularly
evil
expression
taking
the
wet
handkerchief
from
ketch
hand
he
knelt
beside
aunt
amanda
and
bathed
her
face
and
wrists
slapping
her
cheeks
and
temples
smartly
now
and
then
with
the
handkerchief
and
changing
her
position
so
that
her
head
lay
lower
than
her
body
after
he
had
worked
over
her
with
much
care
for
a
few
moments
aunt
amanda
opened
her
eyes
she
was
staring
at
the
frightful
crooked
smile
of
a
strange
man
with
rings
in
his
ears
and
a
kerchief
on
his
head
she
started
up
bewildered
where
toby
where
am
i
who
are
you
captain
lingo
said
the
strange
man
at
your
service
let
me
up
said
aunt
amanda
she
struggled
to
her
feet
rejecting
the
assistance
offered
by
the
man
and
stood
facing
him
her
bedraggled
bonnet
very
much
over
her
right
ear
who
are
you
she
said
again
your
humble
servant
said
the
strange
man
smiling
his
crooked
smile
captain
lingo
by
name
a
gentleman
adventurer
of
the
high
seas
owner
of
the
treasure
which
you
have
discovered
here
in
our
little
retreat
known
here
on
the
spanish
main
as
the
scourge
of
ships
and
loyal
servant
of
his
blessed
majesty
king
james
whom
the
saints
defend
your
obedient
humble
servant
to
command
he
made
the
lady
a
very
courtly
bow
toby
whispered
into
freddie
ear
he
ca
be
so
terrible
bad
not
with
all
that
polite
way
of
talking
do
be
afraid
we
be
all
right
with
this
pirate
who
on
earth
is
king
james
aunt
amanda
was
also
much
relieved
by
the
pirate
polite
address
as
long
as
you
are
my
obedient
servant
said
she
i
thank
you
to
help
us
to
get
out
of
here
as
soon
as
possible
we
did
want
to
come
in
the
first
place
and
we
are
in
a
hurry
to
get
out
captain
lingo
laughed
heartily
they
are
in
a
hurry
to
get
out
lads
he
said
to
his
companions
and
at
this
they
all
laughed
uproariously
i
do
see
anything
to
laugh
at
said
aunt
amanda
if
we
do
get
out
of
here
soon
we
catch
our
death
of
cold
this
made
captain
lingo
laugh
more
heartily
than
before
ha
ha
ha
their
death
of
cold
that
would
be
a
rare
fine
thing
but
a
bit
too
slow
lads
eh
and
the
other
six
laughed
again
so
that
the
walls
of
the
chamber
echoed
with
their
mirth
what
do
you
mean
by
too
slow
said
aunt
amanda
madam
said
captain
lingo
we
are
a
little
pressed
for
time
we
really
could
not
wait
for
you
to
die
of
colds
what
said
aunt
amanda
faintly
her
feeling
of
confidence
beginning
to
ooze
away
do
you
mean
to
say
madam
said
the
pirate
seriously
i
will
put
it
to
you
plainly
our
treasure
which
you
have
discovered
has
taken
a
great
deal
of
hard
work
to
accumulate
we
really
could
bear
to
lose
it
the
people
of
this
island
and
a
great
many
other
people
besides
have
been
trying
for
many
years
to
find
it
you
have
not
only
found
it
but
you
have
even
gone
so
far
as
to
open
certain
of
our
bags
in
spite
of
the
warning
posted
above
your
heads
now
picture
to
yourselves
dear
madam
and
gentlemen
what
consequences
would
certainly
ensue
if
you
were
to
leave
here
ahem
alive
oh
gasped
aunt
amanda
leave
here
alive
all
the
fruits
of
our
industry
would
be
lost
and
our
own
safety
would
be
imperilled
you
will
readily
see
that
of
course
is
a
pity
so
many
will
have
to
die
at
once
for
it
will
mess
up
the
place
very
badly
and
i
always
endeavor
to
be
neat
but
why
did
so
many
of
you
come
at
once
could
you
have
come
say
two
at
a
time
it
would
have
made
so
much
less
trouble
ho
said
punch
hif
we
only
stopped
at
hall
of
us
however
i
do
not
wish
you
to
feel
too
keenly
the
trouble
you
are
putting
us
to
my
brave
lads
will
cheerfully
put
up
with
the
inconvenience
though
i
must
confess
the
amount
of
blood
will
be
quite
unusual
and
so
many
bodies
will
be
troublesome
to
bury
i
wish
it
were
possible
to
have
you
walk
the
plank
however
pray
do
not
bother
too
much
on
our
account
we
were
thinking
about
you
at
all
said
toby
we
were
thinking
about
ourselves
oh
said
captain
lingo
in
a
tone
of
disappointment
i
beg
your
pardon
i
misunderstood
at
any
rate
we
will
now
prepare
for
our
little
ceremony
if
there
are
any
trifling
articles
of
jewelry
and
the
like
i
will
be
pleased
to
but
this
boy
cried
toby
and
this
lady
you
do
mean
to
you
mean
not
for
worlds
said
captain
lingo
would
i
be
rude
to
a
lady
i
trust
you
will
find
my
conduct
towards
the
lady
beyond
reproach
there
shall
be
no
rudeness
of
any
kind
merely
a
quick
stroke
and
all
will
be
over
no
violence
no
roughness
of
any
kind
not
a
word
to
offend
the
most
sensitive
ears
a
single
stroke
and
the
affair
is
done
and
let
me
tell
you
i
have
here
with
me
a
practitioner
who
is
very
expert
in
this
sort
of
business
our
friend
ketch
in
fact
who
was
so
kind
as
to
wet
the
handkerchief
for
the
lady
i
assure
you
that
you
are
in
great
luck
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
such
a
practitioner
he
will
make
it
as
pleasant
for
you
as
possible
one
stroke
only
i
promise
you
with
one
stroke
of
a
cutlass
he
is
able
to
slice
off
a
head
as
neatly
as
you
could
do
it
with
a
broadaxe
there
are
very
few
who
can
do
it
with
a
cutlass
let
me
tell
you
that
many
men
have
become
famous
by
being
operated
on
by
ketch
i
remember
a
case
however
he
said
looking
about
him
as
if
considering
something
and
speaking
rather
to
himself
than
to
the
others
it
would
be
difficult
to
bury
the
bodies
here
and
the
light
is
not
very
good
i
think
yes
i
think
it
had
better
be
done
outside
you
are
already
wet
and
i
trust
that
another
immersion
will
not
inconvenience
you
too
much
lads
he
said
to
his
six
men
put
on
the
rubber
suits
and
help
our
friends
under
the
fall
look
alive
now
the
six
men
immediately
ran
to
their
rubber
suits
and
began
to
put
them
on
while
they
were
doing
this
toby
put
one
arm
about
freddie
and
the
other
about
aunt
amanda
she
lowered
her
head
to
his
shoulder
for
a
moment
but
she
soon
raised
it
and
standing
very
erect
she
said
very
well
if
it
must
be
it
must
it
easy
to
see
that
this
bloodthirsty
villain
means
every
word
he
says
but
i
ai
going
to

i
the
captain
and
i
order
that
everybody
keep
up
his
courage
and
wait
and
see
what
will
happen

said
the
churchwarden
do

whispered
the
old
codger
with
the
wooden
leg
i
believe

in
a
good
deal
of
er
danger
freddie
put
his
hand
in
toby
and
held
it
tight
you
keep
close
to
me
if

said
toby
squeezing
his
hand
we
may
be
rescued
at
the
last
minute
you
never
can
tell
do
lose
your
nerve
freddie
was
trembling
with
fear
and
the
hand
which
held
toby
was
as
cold
as
ice
but
he
said
nothing
the
others
were
being
brave
and
he
resolved
that
he
would
be
as
brave
as
the
rest
up
to
the
very
last
he
began
to
think
of
his
mother
and
his
father
and
to
wonder
what
would
become
of
them
if
he
should
be
but
he
forced
himself
not
to
think
of
that
he
pressed
his
lips
tight
together
and
commanded
himself
to
be
brave
the
six
pirates
returned
clad
in
their
baggy
rubber
suits
and
looking
very
much
like
bears
walking
on
their
hind
legs
they
brought
with
them
captain
lingo
suit
and
helped
him
to
get
into
it
when
he
was
encased
like
the
others
with
only
his
hands
and
face
showing
he
said
now
madam
i
will
assist
you
to
the
fall
we
attend
to
that
put
in
toby
quickly
come
on
mr
punch
aunt
amanda
cane
having
been
lost
she
found
more
difficulty
in
walking
than
formerly
but
toby
and
punch
supported
her
to
such
good
effect
that
she
kept
up
with
the
others
very
well
on
their
march
into
the
water
towards
the
fall
all
except
the
pirates
shivered
as
the
cold
water
came
again
around
their
knees
and
they
looked
with
fear
upon
the
tumbling
cataract
which
they
were
required
to
go
under
there
was
no
help
for
it
however
the
seven
pirates
surrounded
them
and
persuaded
them
to
go
on
they
stood
in
a
forlorn
group
in
the
quiet
water
near
the
foot
of
the
fall
now
madam
said
captain
lingo
i
will
help
you
under
toby
and
punch
feeling
that
the
pirate
knew
the
way
better
than
they
did
resigned
aunt
amanda
to
his
care
not
without
some
fear
that
the
villain
might
deliberately
drown
her
on
the
way
through
he
made
her
kneel
in
the
water
and
then
lie
flat
and
with
a
strong
arm
he
pulled
her
under
the
and
out
of
sight
you
next
said
a
deep
voice
to
freddie
and
ketch
the
practitioner
seized
him
and
plunged
with
him
under
the
water
and
in
an
instant
they
had
disappeared
beyond
the
fall
one
after
another
the
miserable
shivering
victims
were
assisted
by
the
pirates
under
the
water
and
one
by
one
disappeared
the
old
codger
with
the
wooden
leg
was
the
last
and
one
of
the
pirates
returned
for
him
when
he
had
followed
the
others
the
great
chamber
remained
as
it
had
been
before
in
its
empty
solitude
and
gloom
without
an
ear
to
hear
the
steady
rush
of
water
pouring
incessantly
down
its
fall
on
the
outer
side
of
that
rushing
fall
was
a
scene
very
different
indeed
the
pirates
and
their
captives
stood
under
a
blazing
sun
looking
across
a
wide
and
beautiful
landscape
behind
them
in
the
side
of
a
high
hill
overgrown
with
bushes
was
the
hole
by
which
they
had
come
forth
and
across
the
inside
of
this
hole
was
the
curtain
of
falling
water
freddie
wondered
how
anyone
had
ever
had
the
courage
to
plunge
for
the
first
time
through
that
curtain
into
the
unknown
dark
the
heat
of
the
sun
was
very
grateful
and
the
clothing
of
the
soaked
travellers
began
to
dry
perceptibly
at
once
the
pirates
took
off
their
rubber
suits
beneath
the
observers
the
ground
sloped
down
into
a
broad
valley
chequered
with
grass
meadows
and
dotted
with
trees
to
their
left
as
they
gazed
out
across
the
landscape
the
ground
rose
from
the
valley
by
easy
stages
to
a
great
height
no
doubt
forming
the
landward
side
of
the
black
cliff
which
bordered
the
ocean
to
the
right
the
country
rolled
gently
away
from
the
valley
in
a
vast
unbroken
forest
a
shimmering
green
ocean
of
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
far
far
off
where
the
forest
rose
in
a
kind
of
mound
freddie
thought
he
could
see
what
looked
like
the
top
of
a
round
tower
just
emerging
above
the
haze
of
trees
the
pirates
and
their
captives
were
standing
on
a
little
grassy
plateau
on
which
were
great
boulders
here
and
there
and
a
few
wide
leafy
trees
two
or
three
fallen
logs
were
lying
near
the
edge
of
the
plateau
where
it
began
to
slope
downward
captain
lingo
stepped
out
of
his
rubber
suit
spread
out
his
fine
white
handkerchief
on
a
boulder
to
dry
and
twiddled
his
moist
fingers
daintily
in
the
air
after
which
he
blew
on
his
and
polished
them
on
his
we
are
now
ready
said
he
for
the
ceremony
ketch
thy
cutlass
ketch
drew
his
cutlass
from
his
belt
and
handed
it
to
the
captain
it
glittered
wickedly
in
the
sunlight
the
captain
ran
his
thumb
along
its
edge
and
nodded
his
head
with
satisfaction
it
will
do
said
he
one
stroke
for
each
will
be
quite
sufficient
we
will
now
proceed
with
the
ceremony
he
restored
the
cutlass
to
the
practitioner
who
raised
it
high
and
gave
a
swinging
slash
downward
with
it
as
if
to
test
his
eye
and
arm
the
practitioner
then
rolled
his
right
up
to
his
shoulder
he
was
the
largest
man
in
the
party
and
his
arm
was
the
arm
of
a
blacksmith
stop
cried
punch
one
moment
captain
lingo

kingdom

sentence
him
to
die
for

captain
said
the
practitioner
the
captain
cast
his
angry
eye
over
the
terrified
group
shivering
in
their
damp
garments
one
of
you
must
be
first
who
shall
be
first
let
me
see
each
person
quailed
as
the
pirate
eye
rested
on
him
one
moment
we
will
decide
it
by
chance
he
plucked
seven
sprigs
of
grass
and
broke
them
into
varying
lengths
he
then
held
them
in
his
hand
so
that
only
the
even
ends
showed
now
choose
said
he
the
longest
blade

blade
of
grass
except
punch

reserved

last

quartered

said
the
captain
to
him
to
dare
imagine
the
death
of
the
king
freddie
trembled
as
he
drew
his
sprig
of
grass
but
he
did
not
draw
the
longest
the
longest
blade
fell
to
hanlon
and
the
next
to
freddie
toby
was
third
the
churchwarden
fourth
the
sly
old
codger
fifth
aunt
amanda
sixth
and
the
old
codger
with
the
wooden
leg
seventh
we
will
use
that
fallen
log
said
the
captain
and
led
the
way
towards
it
he
was
now
very
stern
all
his
politeness
had
been
dissipated
by
the
offense
of
punch
toby
said
aunt
amanda
as
they
were
moving
towards
the
place
of
the
ceremony
i
hope
you
will
excuse
me
for
all
the
cross
words
i
have
ever
spoken
to
you
oh
nonsense
aunt
amanda
said
toby
sniffling
a
little
i
been
a
trial
enough
i
know
it
what
will
become
of
the
shop
poor
freddie
said
aunt
amanda
it
just
breaks
my
heart
to
see
him
so
brave
he
so
young
to
have
to
to
and
his
poor
mother
oh
dear
oh
dear
now
then
said
captain
lingo
you
may
sit
down
on
the
grass
until
your
turns
come
toby
helped
aunt
amanda
to
sit
down
freddie
sat
beside
her
and
pressed
his
white
face
against
her
shoulder
the
others
grouped
themselves
on
the
grass
about
them
all
except
hanlon
who
knowing
that
his
time
had
come
stepped
forward
and
stood
before
ketch
the
practitioner
who
was
feeling
the
edge
of
his
cutlass
one
of
the
pirates
produced
from
his
pocket
some
strong
twine
and
bound
hanlon
arms
behind
him
on
a
sign
from
captain
lingo
this
man
led
hanlon
to
the
fallen
log
and
made
him
kneel
beside
it
and
rest
his
head
face
down
upon
it
so
that
there
was
a
good
view
from
above
of
the
back
of
his
neck
the
dreadful
moment
had
arrived
ketch
the
practitioner
took
his
place
by
hanlon
side
planted
his
feet
firmly
wide
apart
tucked
in
his
right
at
the
shoulder
and
raised
his
gleaming
cutlass
high
above
his
head
a
scream
from
aunt
amanda
made
him
hesitate
for
an
instant
but
only
for
an
instant
as
aunt
amanda
and
freddie
closed
their
eyes
and
buried
their
faces
in
their
hands
the
cutlass
flashed
twice
around
the
head
of
ketch
and
came
down
with
a
swift
and
horrible
slash
straight
upon
the
back
of
hanlon
neck
a
single
stroke
was
enough
hanlon
head
rolled
off
upon
the
ground
well
done
ketch
said
captain
lingo
quietly
i
doubt
if
another
hand
on
the
spanish
main
could
have
done
it
ketch
blushed
with
honest
pride
at
these
gracious
words
he
swung
his
bloody
cutlass
in
embarrassment
all
the
pirates
turned
towards
the
pale
group
on
the
grass
and
captain
lingo
said
next
freddie
stood
up
his
knees
began
to
tremble
under
him
and
his
heart
was
beating
so
fast
that
he
could
hardly
breathe
aunt
amanda
flung
her
arms
about
him
as
he
stood
beside
her
and
cried
no
no
no
in
a
voice
of
anguish
all
eyes
were
on
the
little
boy
as
he
stood
awaiting
his
dreadful
fate
with
aunt
amanda
arms
about
him
his
time
had
come
his
friends
were
waiting
to
see
if
he
would
be
brave
and
though
his
face
was
white
his
courage
did
not
fail
him
he
looked
at
them
in
farewell
and
each
one
gave
him
a
tearful
gaze
in
return
he
turned
his
eyes
towards
the
warm
and
friendly
landscape
for
a
last
look
at
the
world
he
was
about
to
leave
it
would
be
hard
to
go
and
he
would
need
all
his
strength
to
bear
the
a
loud
cry
from
freddie
startled
all
the
others
look
he
cried
and
pointed
a
shaking
finger
they
looked
and
what
they
saw
was
hanlon
by
the
log
on
which
his
head
had
been
cut
off
hanlon
was
standing
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
his
head
in
its
proper
place
on
his
shoulders
he
was
smiling
and
bowing
and
as
the
astonished
spectators
gazed
at
him
with
their
mouths
open
he
sprang
lightly
into
the
air
and
clicked
his
heels
together
as
he
came
down
illustration
hanlon
was
standing
by
the
log
on
which
his
head
had
been
cut
off
ha
ha
ha
laughed
toby
in
spite
of
himself
freddie
we
seen
that
little
act
before
have
we
freddie
nodded
he
remembered
very
well
the
first
time
he
had
seen
hanlon
head
cut
off
at
the
gaunt
street
theatre
at
home
he
wondered
that
he
had
not
thought
of
it
before
captain
lingo
was
plainly
very
angry
his
face
turned
a
purple
hue
and
the
scar
across
his
mouth
showed
very
white
he
fingered
his
knife
dangerously
and
at
the
same
time
glared
at
ketch
who
was
scratching
his
head
in
bewilderment
the
captain
did
not
raise
his
voice
but
he
spoke
with
deadly
earnestness
a
fine
workman
thou
friend
ketch
said
he
truly
a
pretty
hand
with
a
cutlass
thou
son
of
a
i
a
mind
to
let
a
little
of
thy
blood
with
this
knife
thou
scurvy
knave
but
i
will
give
thee
one
more
chance
if
thou
fail
again
by
george
thou
shalt
die
the
death
once
more
now
and
remember
it
was
ketch
turn
now
to
tremble
he
knew
very
well
that
captain
lingo
would
do
as
he
had
said
if
he
should
fail
a
second
time
his
own
life
hung
on
a
thread
now
ay
ay
captain
he
said
huskily
and
led
hanlon
back
to
the
fallen
log
and
made
him
kneel
as
before
as
hanlon
head
lay
across
the
log
he
turned
it
round
towards
his
friends
and
gave
them
a
long
slow
wink
ketch
cutlass
flashed
as
before
round
his
head
it
swung
twice
and
down
it
came
with
a
slashing
stroke
straight
and
true
on
the
back
of
hanlon
neck
off
rolled
hanlon
head
upon
the
ground
everyone
watched
breathlessly
and
ketch
did
not
breathe
at
all
for
a
second
hanlon
body
continued
to
kneel
headless
beside
the
log
then
the
head
on
the
ground
popped
like
a
flash
to
the
neck
it
belonged
to
and
fastened
itself
accurately
there
in
place
ketch
turned
ghastly
pale
hanlon
sprang
up
opened
his
mouth
wide
in
a
soundless
laugh
bowed
to
captain
lingo
jumped
lightly
into
the
air
and
clicked
his
heels
together
three
times
as
he
came
down
captain
lingo
face
was
a
terrible
sight
to
see
he
gazed
steadily
at
ketch
the
unfortunate
practitioner
was
shaking
like
a
leaf
captain
lingo
slowly
drew
his
knife
and
held
it
behind
him
in
his
right
hand
with
the
other
hand
he
pointed
to
the
ground
before
him
hither
dog
he
said
in
a
quiet
even
voice
ketch
hesitated
gave
a
wild
look
about
him
and
advanced
slowly
towards
his
captain
when
he
reached
him
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
held
up
his
shaking
hands
no
no
no
captain
he
cried
do
do
it
oh
please
do
do
it
i
done
my
duty
always
and
i
ai
never
failed
before
remember
my
poor
old
mother
captain
give
me
one
chance
captain
just
one
do
kill
me
captain
captain
the
expression
on
lingo
face
did
not
change
but
the
glitter
in
his
eye
became
even
more
murderous
than
before
he
said
not
a
word
but
with
his
left
hand
snatched
off
the
kerchief
which
bound
ketch
head
and
seized
him
by
the
hair
and
with
his
other
hand
he
brought
the
knife
swiftly
around
in
front
and
lowered
it
to
plunge
it
into
ketch
heart
at
that
moment
aunt
amanda
forgetting
her
lameness
struggled
to
her
feet
hobbled
to
the
kneeling
man
and
throwing
her
body
between
him
and
the
knife
shrieked
at
captain
lingo
stop
stop
you
bloodthirsty
villain
ai

captain
lingo
was
taken
completely
by
surprise
his
eyes
opened
wide
and
his
jaw
dropped
he
was
so
astonished
that
he
took
his
hand
from
hair
and
put
up
his
knife
that

idea
said
aunt
amanda

of
a
man
than

thought

still
pale
and
trembling
stood
up
and
seizing
one
of
aunt
amanda
hands
in
both
of
his
made
a
low
bow
over
it
and
kissed
it
fervently
by
the
look
in
his
eyes
it
was
plain
to
see
that
he
was
from
that
moment
her
devoted
slave
madam
and
gentlemen
said
captain
lingo
i
am
sorry
to
inform

that
the
ceremony
is
over
until
i
can
obtain
another
practitioner
to
take
the
place

blush
with
shame
when

think

i
boasted

meant
to
deceive

be
i

provoked
and
disgusted
and
irritated
i
am
annoyed
i
ca
deny
it
there
is
nothing
to
do
but
to
retire
to
our
home
in
high
dudgeon
what
that
said
aunt
amanda
is
it
a
place
or
is
it
just
the
way
you
feel
ask
me
no
more
said
captain
lingo
turning
away
i
must
confer
with
my
lads
about
our
next
step
are
you
going
to
take
us
with
you
asked
aunt
amanda
we
shall
certainly
give
ourselves
that
pleasure
madam
said
the
captain
rather
stiffly
lads

with
me
on
a
sign
from
the
captain
one
of
the
pirates
cut
the
twine
which
bound
hanlon
hands
and
the
restored
one
joined
his
friends
on
the
grass
the
seven
pirates
moved
away
to
a
spot
some
score
of
yards
apart
where
they
all
sat
down
on
the
ground
and
engaged
at
once
in
animated
talk
i
conclude
said
the
churchwarden
though
i
do
know
as
i
right
about
it
and
other
people
may
have
a
different
opinion
that
we
a
good
deal
better
off
what
i
say
is
said
toby
clapping
freddie
on
the
shoulder
what
i
say
is
three
cheers
for
mr
hanlon
yes
said
freddie

just
what
i
said
that
day
after
the
theatre
i
wonder
said
the

codger
with

leg
i

a
thing

pinch
of

about
him
chapter

high

and
low
dudgeon
the
pirate
captain
and
his
men
rose
from
the
ground
and
captain
lingo
in
his
politest
manner
requested
his
captives
to
follow
him
the
entire
party
moved
down
the
slope
into
the
valley
and
after
a
walk
of
some
quarter
of
a
mile
entered
a
grove
of
trees
in
this
grove
were
tethered
ten
handsome
mules
of
which
seven
were
saddled
and
three
were
laden
with
packs
one
of
the
was
quickly
unladen
a
fire
was
built
and
in
ten
minutes
the
hungry
guests
and
their
hosts
were
making
a
very
good
breakfast
of
bacon
fried
by
leatherbread
as
the
captain
called
him
one
of
the
pirates
to
whom
the
business
of
the
was
left
by
general
consent
when
the
bacon
had
been
washed
down
with
clear
cold
water
from
a
spring
near
by
and
the
mule
had
been
packed
again
freddie
and
aunt
amanda
were
assisted
into
the
saddles
of
the
two
smallest
mules
and
the
captain
mounted
into
the
saddle
of
the
largest
now
look
here
captain
lingo
said
aunt
amanda
i
want
to
know
where
we
are
going
and
all
about
it
the
idea
of
me
sitting
here
of
a
mule
and
this
bonnet
simply
ruined
and
my
dress
just
about
fit
to
go
to
the
man
and
my
hair
look
here
captain
lingo
i
going
a
step
on
this
mule
until
you
tell
me
what
pardon
me
my
dear
lady
said
the
captain
but
i
must
ask
you
to
put
up
with
my
little
whims
a
short
while
longer
i
beg
the
pleasure
of
your
society
upon
a
little
journey
nothing
more
i
assure
you
the
country
is
very
interesting
may
i
not
promise
myself
the
bliss
of
your
approval
he
turned
to
the
six
pirates
with
a
scowl
mount
the
rest
of
them
scoundrels
four
of
the
captives
were
mounted
by
the
pirates
on
the
remaining
mules
and
the
procession
moved
out
of
the
grove
into
the
open
valley
freddie
had
never
ridden
a
mule
before
and
he
was
delighted
when
they
entered
as
they
soon
did
the
great
forest
which
they
had
seen
from
the
plateau
freddie
was
more
than
ever
delighted
after
the
blazing
sun
of
the
open
country
the
shade
of
the
forest
was
delicious
the
trees
were
huge
and
while
the
trunks
were
far
apart
their
branches
made
a
leafy
roof
overhead
which
was
almost
unbroken
flowering
plants
grew
everywhere
vines
climbed
the
trees
little
streams
murmured
here
and
there
and
the
only
sound
which
disturbed
the
repose
of
the
forest
was
the
occasional
screech
of
a
parrot
and
the
occasional
chatter
of
monkeys
the
first
time
freddie
heard
the
sudden
scream
of
a
parrot
in
the
stillness
he
was
thoroughly
alarmed
but
when
he
learned
what
it
was
and
saw
the
flash
of
the
bird
plumage
between
the
trees
he
forgot
all
about
his
danger
and
for
the
rest
of
the
day
he
gave
himself
up
to
the
pleasure
of
watching
for
parrots
and
monkeys
among
the
branches
the
sly
old
codger
turned
in
his
saddle
and
said
to
toby
who
was
riding
behind
with
punch
walking
between
a
work
of
nature
my
dear
friend
a
real
work
of
nature
beautiful
parrots
and
monkeys
flitting
about
overhead
the
primeval
forest
stretching
its
bosky
arms
above
us
in
all
directions
bosky
what
one
might
call
a
real
work
of
nature
so
very
very
bosky
right
you
are
said
toby
it
puts
our
druid
hill
park
in
the
shade
that
a
fact
makes
it
take
a
back
seat
and
play
second
fiddle
as
sure
as
you
born
hi
beg
your
pardon
said
punch
can
a
park
sit
down
and
play
a
fiddle
all
day
long
they
moved
onward
single
file
further
and
further
into
the
depths
of
the
forest
at
noon
they
halted
for
a
luncheon
of
fried
bacon
prepared
by
leatherbread
the
afternoon
wore
on
and
the
forest
became
gloomier
and
gloomier
about
them
as
they
marched
the
silence
grew
almost
terrifying
and
all
the
pleasure
which
freddie
had
felt
in
the
morning
vanished
night
fell
and
the
procession
entered
a
little
clearing
and
there
the
pirates
made
camp
for
the
night
after
a
supper
of
fried
bacon
prepared
by
leatherbread
the
whole
party
retired
to
rest
each
on
a
mattress
of
green
branches
and
leaves
covered
with
blankets
the
night
was
mild
and
when
the
last
blanket
had
been
made
ready
the
moon
rose
and
tinged
the
tops
of
the
trees
with
silver
and
while
freddie
was
watching
the
moon
as
it
climbed
higher
he
fell
asleep
aunt
amanda
did
not
go
to
sleep
so
soon
ketch
the
practitioner
had
devoted
himself
very
specially
to
her
in
preparing
her
while
he
was
spreading
the
branches
and
blankets
for
her
she
said
to
him
ketch
where
are
we
going
not
so
loud
said
he
we
are
going
to
high
dudgeon
high
dudgeon
what
that
when
we
disappointed
or
disgusted
or
vexed
we
always
go
to
our
home
in
high
dudgeon
is
that
where
you
live
part
of
the
time
mostly
we
are
away
at
sea
or
on
the
island
but
when
anything
goes
wrong
and
we
angry
about
it
we
always
go
home
and
stay
there
in
high
dudgeon
yes
and
what
are
they
going
to
do
with
us
when
they
get
us
there

in
great
danger
there
if
you
can
find
any
way
to
escape
from
there
i
advise
you
not
another
word
captain
lingo
is
looking
this
way
i
must
go
aunt
amanda
did
not
sleep
very
well
that
night
in
the
morning
after
a
breakfast
of
fried
bacon
prepared
by
leatherbread
the
company
resumed
its
march
at
noon
a
halt
was
made
beside
a
spring
for
rest
and
food
and
here
leatherbread
prepared
a
luncheon
of
fried
bacon
in
the
evening
as
the
travellers
were
plodding
onward
ketch
walked
for
a
time
at
the
head
of
aunt
amanda
mule
aunt
amanda
leaned
forward
and
said
to
him
ketch
are
we
going
to
have
more
bacon
tonight
no
said
he
in
a
low
voice
we
have
supper
in
high
dudgeon
my
old
mother
the
cook
there
you
heard
me
mention
her
yesterday
morning
i
an
idea
there
be
pigeon
pies
for
supper
and
mark
what
i
saying
to
you
his
voice
sank
to
a
whisper
if
you
get
a
pigeon
pie
for
supper
look
careful
to
see
what
inside
of
it
before
you
eat
it
mercy
on
us
said
aunt
amanda
are
they
going
to
poison
us
but
ketch
slipped
away
in
the
gathering
darkness
and
said
no
more
they
had
gone
but
a
few
hundred
yards
further
when
at
the
moment
when
the
darkness
of
night
was
making
ready
to
blot
out
everything
they
suddenly
emerged
into
a
round
grassy
clearing
enclosed
by
the
forest
where
the
light
was
better
and
over
which
a
star
or
two
could
be
seen
glimmering
in
a
pale
blue
sky
in
the
midst
of
this
clearing
rose
a
tower
it
was
a
round
tower
built
of
stone
its
top
came
scarcely
to
the
top
of
the
surrounding
trees
and
it
was
in
fact
not
more
than
two
stories
high
it
appeared
with
its
wide
girth
low
and
squat
its
sides
were
pierced
here
and
there
with
deep
and
narrow
slits
for
windows
and
on
one
side
was
a
heavy
oaken
door
with
great
iron
hinges
and
an
iron
lock
through
two
or
three
of
the
upper
slits
in
the
wall
glimmered
a
light
from
within
it
was
otherwise
dark
and
forbidding
aunt
amanda
found
ketch
at
her
mule
head
again
she
leaned
forward
and
said
to
him
is
that
high
dudgeon
no
that
low
dudgeon
low
dudgeon
what
do
you
mean
by
low
dudgeon
ketch
looked
at
the
tower
and
shuddered
i
do
like
to
talk
about
it
i
do
like
the
place
it
the
place
where
we
used
to
live
long
ago
before
we
built
high
dudgeon
there
none
of
us
wants
to
live
there
now
we
have
lived
there
since
ketch
paused
and
shuddered
again
and
evidently
decided
not
to
go
on
there
a
light
up
there
said
aunt
amanda
does
anybody
live
there
no
said
ketch
nobody
there
but
there
a
light
said
aunt
amanda
surely
there
must
be
somebody
there
there
is
there
is
thirteen
of
thirteen
what
but
ketch
only
shuddered
again
and
would
say
no
more
aunt
amanda
noticed
that
instead
of
going
straight
onward
past
the
door
of
low
dudgeon
the
pirates
led
the
file
in
a
wide
course
away
from
it
along
the
edge
of
the
clearing
as
if
to
avoid
coming
near
to
it
and
when
the
procession
had
thus
skirted
the
clearing
and
entered
the
forest
again
on
the
other
side
leaving
the
low
tower
behind
a
sigh
as
if
of
relief
went
up
from
ketch
and
all
the
other
pirates
except
however
from
captain
lingo
himself
who
appeared
to
be
wholly
indifferent
how
much
further
said
aunt
amanda
to
ketch
about
a
mile
said
he
the
last
mile
of
their
journey
was
a
long
mile
and
it
was
traversed
in
perfect
darkness
the
moon
had
not
yet
risen
not
a
word
was
spoken
and
there
was
no
sound
except
the
pad
of
the
mules
feet
and
the
breaking
of
twigs
and
branches
as
the
travellers
pushed
their
way
through
the
prisoners
were
in
a
state
of
greater
nervousness
and
anxiety
than
before
and
as
they
neared
the
place
where
their
lives
were
to
be
disposed
of
in
one
way
or
another
their
sense
of
uncertainty
became
almost
unbearable
when
it
seemed
that
they
must
be
close
to
the
fateful
place
the
procession
suddenly
halted
and
at
the
same
instant
the
screech
of
a
parrot
startled
the
silence
and
made
each
of
the
prisoners
jump
it
only
the
captain
said
ketch
it
a
signal
immediately
as
if
in
response
there
came
from
a
distance
in
advance
the
note
of
a
cuckoo
three
times
repeated
the
procession
moved
forward
a
moment
or
two
later
the
whole
company
came
forth
from
the
forest
under
the
stars
and
stood
on
the
edge
of
a
wide
round
clearing
grown
high
with
grass
and
weeds
in
the
midst
of
this
clearing
rose
a
tower
high
dudgeon
said
ketch
over
his
shoulder
this
also
was
a
round
tower
built
of
stone
but
it
was
very
tall
much
taller
than
the
highest
trees
and
from
the
top
there
must
have
been
a
view
of
all
the
surrounding
country
even
as
far
as
the
hill
within
which
was
the
treasure
cave
from
the
number
of
deep
and
narrow
slits
which
served
as
windows
it
must
have
been
six
or
seven
stories
high
the
top
of
the
tower
was
flat
with
battlements
around
the
rim
as
a
fortress
it
seemed
to
be
impregnable
as
a
it
was
very
dismal
indeed
it
was
totally
dark
the
captives
trembled
at
the
thought
of
being
imprisoned
in
such
a
place
the
wayfarers
proceeded
in
their
single
file
directly
to
the
great
oaken
door
of
the
tower
and
those
who
were
mounted
got
down
ketch
assisted
aunt
amanda
and
freddie
to
alight
and
having
done
so
he
took
charge
of
the
mules
and
led
them
away
captain
lingo
took
from
his
breeches
pocket
a
small
key
and
unlocked
the
door
be
so
kind
as
to
enter
he
said
and
made
way
for
the
captives
and
his
men
when
all
were
within
including
ketch
who
had
now
returned
the
captain
locked
the
door
on
the
inside
and
restored
the
key
to
his
pocket

the

for

they
were
in
a
dark
and
narrow
as
they
stood
huddled
there
together
a
candle
glimmered
at
the
end
of
the
passage
held
in
a
tremulous
hand
and
lighting
up
the
face
of
a
very
old
woman
she
advanced
towards
the
party
by
the
door
and
holding
her
candle
high
above
her
head
inspected
the
strangers
with
little
blinking
watery
eyes
she
was
short
and
bent
she
hobbled
as
she
came
forward
her
face
was
seamed
with
deep
wrinkles

the
hand
which
held
the
candle
was
knotted
and

of
dirty

hair
hung
over

fixed

on

impatiently

mother
ketch
slowly
removed
her
eyes
from
aunt

and
looked
at
the
captain
steadily
there
nought
but
pigeons

said
she
good

the

then
we
will
have

for

off
mother
ketch
turned
and
hobbled
slowly
down
the
passage
and
the
glimmer
of
her
candle
disappeared
follow
me
said
captain

the
six
pirates
vanished
somewhere
in

darkness

the
others
followed

lingo
up
a
winding
stair
at
the
top
was
a
heavy
door
which
he
unlocked
with
his
key
and
locked
again
on
the
inside
after
his
guests
had
passed
through
he
then
led
them
down
a
dark
and
turning
to
the
right
unlocked
a
door
with
his
key
and
threw
it
open
they
were
in
a
large
on
the
table
of
which
were
numerous
candles
which
the
captain
lighted
in
one
wall
was
an
opening
for
a
for
sending
up
food
from
the
kitchen
below
the
party
seated
themselves
at
the
table
and
after
a
considerable
time
ketch
entered
a
napkin
on
his
arm
and
at
the
same
time
the
rose
from
the
kitchen
and
the
meal
commenced
ketch
waited
on
the
table
besides
pigeon
pies
there
were
mushrooms
a
lettuce
salad
hot
biscuit
and
excellent
coffee
ketch
placed
the
first
pigeon
pie
before
the
captain
and
aunt
amanda
noticed
that
he
examined
the
top
of
it
carefully
as
he
did
so
she
observed
that
he
examined
the
top
of
each
pie
carefully
before
he
placed
it
until
he
had
put
one
before
herself
after
which
he
put
the
others
about
without
looking
at
them
she
examined
the
top
of
her
own
pie
herself
to
see
what
ketch
could
have
been
looking
at
she
saw
in
the
center
of
it
a
tiny
figure
made
of
very
brown
dough
and
as
she
looked
closer
it
seemed
to
have
the
shape
of
a
tiny
key
she
glanced
at
the
other
pies
and
none
of
them
bore
any
mark
of
this
kind
everyone
set
to
with
a
good
will
and
aunt
amanda
opened
her
pie
she
remembered
ketch
caution
and
she
prodded
it
secretly
with
her
fork
before
taking
a
bite
at
the
bottom
her
fork
touched
something
hard
she
immediately
began
to
put
the
contents
of
her
pie
on
her
plate
and
she
did
so
in
such
a
way
as
to
leave
the
hard
object
beneath
the
rest
in
the
course
of
the
meal
she
dropped
a
portion
of
the
pie
to
the
floor
and
stooped
to
pick
it
up
as
she
did
so
she
managed
to
take
the
hard
object
from
her
plate
and
conceal
it
in
her
lap
it
was
a
key
when
the
meal
was
over
the
captain
led
his
guests
forth
to
their
respective
bedrooms
each
carrying
a
lighted
candle
from
the
table
at
the
top
of
a
stair
was
a
closed
door
which
he
unlocked
with
his
key
and
locked
after
the
others
had
passed
through
along
the
passage
which
ran
from
this
door
were
doors
at
intervals
in
the
walls
and
these
he
opened
one
after
another
showing
one
of
his
guests
each
time
into
a
bedroom
and
leaving
him
there
on
the
stair
aunt
amanda
had
whispered
into
toby
ear
the
words
do
go
to
bed
pass
it
along
and
these
words
had
been
passed
in
a
whisper
from
one
to
another
of
the
captives
aunt
amanda
in
her
own
room
now
sat
herself
down
to
wait
she
blew
out
her
candle
and
sat
watching
the
shaft
of
moonlight
which
came
through
the
slit
that
served
for
a
window
she
must
have
fallen
asleep
for
she
came
to
herself
with
a
start
and
found
the
shaft
of
moonlight
gone
she
limped
to
the
door
and
found
it
locked
she
took
from
her
dress
the
key
and
unlocked
the
door
the
outside
was
silent
and
dark
she
felt
her
way
along
the
wall
to
the
next
door
and
found
it
locked
she
quietly
unlocked
it
with
her
key
toby
was
sitting
within
waiting
he
rose
without
a
word
and
followed
her
they
tiptoed
from
door
to
door
finding
each
one
locked
and
silently
released
each
of
the
prisoners
the
key
fitted
every
lock
on
their
way
down
stairs
they
reached
the
ground
floor
without
an
accident
and
there
in
the
passage
which
they
had
first
seen
they
stopped
to
listen
they
heard
the
click
of
a
latch
at
the
rear
a
door
there
opened
quietly
on
a
crack
and
a
light
shone
through
every
heart
stopped
beating
for
a
moment
the
door
opened
wider
and
a
lighted
candle
appeared
and
over
it
the
wrinkled
face
of
an
old
woman
she
peered
out
into
the
passage
shading
the
candle
with
a
trembling
hand
the
party
of
quaking
runaways
stood
as
still
as
mice
and
held
their
breath
the
old
woman
blinked
for
a
moment
into
the
darkness
and
blew
out
her
candle
all
was
dark
again
and
the
latch
of
the
door
clicked
the
runaways
lost
no
time
they
crept
silently
but
rapidly
to
the
entrance
door
aunt
amanda
unlocked
and
opened
it
and
they
pressed
out
hurriedly
they
were
standing
on
the
grass
in
a
flood
of
moonlight
aunt
amanda
whose
lameness
had
been
almost
forgotten
in
her
excitement
now
leaned
on
toby
who
was
holding
freddie
hand
and
who
led
the
way
to
the
rim
of
the
forest
where
the
trail
lay
there
was
some
difficulty
in
finding
the
trail
but
they
did
find
it
at
last
and
they
filed
into
the
forest
they
had
not
gone
more
than
twenty
yards
when
toby
who
was
in
advance
saw
a
great
black
object
directly
across
their
path
he
went
forward
cautiously
in
spite
of
his
alarm
and
breathed
a
sigh
of
joy
when
he
saw
what
it
was
it
was
a
mule
saddled
and
bridled
and
tied
to
a
bush
further
on
were
other
mules
all
tethered
there
were
ten
in
all
of
which
eight
were
saddled
and
two
were
laden
with
packs
blessings
on
that
ketch
whispered
aunt
amanda
in
a
moment
the
entire
party
were
mounted
in
another
moment
they
were
going
along
the
trail
at
a
fast
walk
the
mules
knew
the
way
and
there
was
now
no
danger
of
going
astray
in
the
forest
only
where
were
they
to
go
after
all
if
the
pirates
should
catch
them
everything
would
soon
be
over
if
they
should
manage
to
elude
the
pirates
they
would
still
be
lost
in
the
wilderness
of
this
unknown
island
what
was
to
become
of
them
not
one
could
tell
the
future
seemed
very
dark
indeed
once
or
twice
they
paused
to
listen
for
sounds
of
pursuit
but
they
heard
nothing
not
a
sound
disturbed
the
stillness
and
the
little
moonlight
which
filtered
here
and
there
through
the
trees
seemed
to
make
the
darkness
more
intense
they
had
gone
about
half
a
mile
and
were
plodding
along
in
drowsy
silence
when
suddenly
out
of
the
tall
bushes
beside
the
trail
seven
dark
figures
sprang
upon
them
and
seized
the
bridles
of
their
mules
ah
cried
toby
we
are
lost
the
pirates
the
mules
stood
stock
still
it
no
use
said
toby
we
ca
escape
they
are
armed
and
we
are
not
all
right
captain
lingo
do
strike
we
surrender
we
go
back
with
you
do
strike
i
beg
your
pardon
said
a
voice
which
none
of
them
had
ever
heard
before
are
you
pirates
ai
you
pirates
yourselves
cried
aunt
amanda
what
said
the
voice
is
there
a
lady
here
in
that
case
you
are
probably
not
pirates
perhaps
we
have
been
too
hasty
i
beg
your
pardon
who
are
you
said
aunt
amanda
do
you
admit
that
you
are
not
pirates
said
the
voice
admit
it
said
aunt
amanda
we
vow
and
declare
it
the
very
idea
i
am
sorry
to
hear
it
said
the
voice
we
are
deeply
disappointed
we
of
course
can
not
doubt
the
word
of
a
lady
but
we
were
almost
sure
we
had
found
them
we
have
been
searching
for
pirates
for
a
long
time
and
we
were
advised
that
they
lived
somewhere
near
here
we
must
have
missed
our
way
could
you
perhaps
direct
us
it
is
a
place
called
high
dudgeon
you
bet
we
could
said
toby
but
we
wo
we
are
running
away
from
there
and
you
had
better
run
too
then
perhaps
you
happen
to
know
the
whereabouts
of
a
place
called
low
dudgeon
where
the
pirates
formerly
lived
we
do
said
toby
you
are
about
now
between
high
dudgeon
and
low
dudgeon
and
you
had
better
get
out
of
this
neighborhood
as
fast
as
you
can
this
is
very
interesting
said
the
voice
i
feel
that
you
will
be
able
to
give
us
some
valuable
information
if
you
have
no
objection
we
will
walk
behind
you
until
we
come
to
a
place
where
there
is
more
light
when
we
will
have
a
few
minutes
conversation
on
this
interesting
subject
the
seven
dark
figures
stood
aside
and
the
mules
moved
onward
the
seven
figures
walked
behind
in
five
minutes
they
reached
a
patch
of
ground
where
the
moon
shone
brightly
through
the
trees
and
the
riders
drew
in
their
animals
and
turned
to
look
at
the
figures
who
now
marched
sedately
up
beside
them
these
figures
stood
in
a
row
facing
the
riders
and
six
of
them
turned
their
heads
to
the
right
looking
towards
the
first
in
the
row
who
was
probably
their
leader
they
were
seven
tall
men
dressed
in
black
frock
coats
and
striped
trousers
with
spats
but
instead
of
high
silk
hats
each
wore
a
small
black
as
more
convenient
no
doubt
for
their
rough
life
in
the
forest
it
could
be
seen
that
they
were
no
ordinary
men
they
looked
like
professors
at
college
their
faces
were
thoughtful
and
even
intellectual
each
one
wore
spectacles
they
squinted
as
if
from
too
much
poring
over
books
by
lamplight
the
one
at
the
head
of
the
row
was
fat
with
whiskers
and
his
frock
coat
was
buttoned
tight
over
a
round
stomach
he
spoke
in
the
same
voice
which
they
had
heard
in
the
dark
i
beg
your
pardon
said
he
if
you
will
be
so
kind
as
to
direct
us
either
to
high
dudgeon
or
to
low
dudgeon
we
will
not
fail
to
gratefully
acknowledge
aha
said
one
of
the
others
in
a
playful
tone
a
split
infinitive
professor
i
beg
your
pardon
a
slight
inadvertence
to
acknowledge
gratefully
your
kind
there
no
time
to
talk
now
said
toby
we
are
running
away
from
these
bloodthirsty
and
if
they
catch
us
we
are
dead
as
sure
as
you
born
i
tell
you
what
we
will
do
we
all
keep
on
to
low
dudgeon
and
we
go
in
there
if
we
can
get
in
and
decide
there
what
we
had
better
do
it
looked
like
a
strong
tower
and
we
would
certainly
be
as
safe
inside
there
as
out
of
doors
if
the
pirates
should
come
along
the
professor
looked
down
the
line
of
his
companions
what
is
the
sense
of
the
committee
on
this
proposal
said
he
ah
very
good
we
are
agreed
proceed
my
dear
sir
one
minute
said
aunt
amanda
excuse
my
asking
but
i
should
like
to
know
who
you
are
anyway
the
professor
waved
a
fat
hand
towards
his
companions
and
looking
at
aunt
amanda
said
we
belong
madam
to
the
society
for
piratical
research
under
the
patronage
of
his
gracious
majesty
the
king
of
this
island
you
behold
before
you
a
committee
of
that
society
the
committee
on
doubtful
and
fabulous
tales
sometimes
called
for
the
sake
of
brevity
from
the
initials
of
its
title
the
daft
committee
as
third
of
the
society
for
piratical
research
i
have
the
honour
to
be
chairman
of
the
daft
committee
the
seat
of
our
society
is
far
from
here
in
the
principal
city
of
this
kingdom
the
famous
city
of
towers
blest
as
the
residence
of
his
gracious
majesty
the
most
learned
and
liberal
of
princes
our
camp
which
we
made
only
late
this
evening
lies
at
no
great
distance
from
this
spot
we
did
not
wish
to
delay
our
researches
until
morning
and
so
as
third
of
the
society
for
piratical
research
and
chairman
of
the
daft
committee
i
much
obliged
said
toby
we
no
time
to
listen
to
any
more
we
must
get
on
the
daft
committee
led
by
the
third
fell
in
behind
the
mules
and
the
whole
party
moved
forward
as
rapidly
as
the
mules
and
the
committee
could
walk
aunt
amanda
felt
far
from
easy
at
the
prospect
of
entering
low
dudgeon
but
she
had
told
toby
something
of
ketch
strange
words
and
manner
regarding
that
place
and
she
was
glad
to
leave
the
responsibility
to
him
their
dark
and
silent
progress
through
the
forest
continued
and
when
they
had
gone
what
they
thought
must
have
been
about
half
a
mile
they
knew
they
must
be
near
their
destination
every
eye
was
watchful
and
every
ear
was
alert
a
grunt
from
toby
in
advance
notified
the
others
that
they
had
arrived
and
they
filed
out
of
the
forest
into
the
clearing
and
saw
before
them
the
squat
tower
of
low
dudgeon
in
the
moonlight
the
same
light
as
before
appeared
from
within
through
the
upper
slits
in
the
side
of
the
tower
as
they
drew
in
their
mules
at
the
edge
of
the
clearing
the
daft
committee
came
up
and
the
third
spoke
in
a
low
voice
i
presume
he
said
that
this
is
low
dudgeon
i
have
heard
of
it
but
i
have
never
seen
it
it
was
formerly
some
hundred
years
ago
the
headquarters
of
the
pirates
but
something
occurred
here
i
do
not
know
what
which
impelled
the
pirates
to
move
they
accordingly
built
themselves
a
much
better
residence
known
as
high
dudgeon
where
i
understand
they
now
live
i
do
not
believe
that
low
dudgeon
has
been
occupied
since
gentlemen
he
said
turning
to
his
companions
we
are
fortunate
in
having
found
this
interesting
place
at
last
after
so
much
trouble
it
is
the
very
spot
in
which
to
begin
our
researches
a
murmur
of
approval
arose
from
the
other
members
of
the
committee
i
do
know
whether
it
occupied
or
not
said
aunt
amanda
ketch
told
me
that
no
one
lives
there
and
that
there
thirteen
of
and
he
seemed
to
be
afraid
of
the
place
and
there
a
light
up
there
i
do
understand
it
gentlemen
said
the
third
is
it
the
sense
of
the
committee
that
we
begin
our
researches
in
low
dudgeon
every
member
of
the
daft
committee
murmured
his
assent
if
we
go
into
the
forest
said
toby
we
may
be
caught
if
we
go
in
here
we
are
safe
for
a
while
anyway
and
we
can
decide
there
what
we
had
better
do
maybe
these
gentlemen
can
send
for
help
anyway
get
in
if
we
can
the
riders
dismounted
from
their
mules
and
tied
them
to
trees
in
another
moment
the
whole
party
were
standing
before
the
door
of
the
tower
better
knock
said
toby
they
knocked
and
knocked
again
there
was
no
answer
aunt
amanda
said
toby
try
your
key
aunt
amanda
tried
the
key
and
it
fitted
she
turned
it
and
the
lock
snapped
back
toby
thrust
open
the
door
the
company
entered
and
toby
took
the
key
and
locked
the
door
behind
them
they
were
in
a
dark
passage
near
the
foot
of
a
winding
stair
we
had
better
go
up
where
the
light
is
said
toby
in
a
whisper
they
went
cautiously
and
noiselessly
up
the
stair
to
the
landing
there
they
found
themselves
in
a
hall
and
at
a
little
distance
down
the
hall
they
saw
a
dim
light
shining
under
a
closed
door
there
it
is
said
toby
come
on
with
the
same
breathless
caution
they
tiptoed
to
the
door
it
had
no
lock
and
toby
turned
the
knob
and
slowly
pushed
it
open
ah
said
toby
in
a
frightened
gasp
and
started
back
the
others
crowded
at
his
back
and
pushed
him
forward
the
third
of
the
society
for
piratical
research
brushed
past
him
into
the
room
and
the
other
six
members
followed
him
the
party
of
fugitives
moved
slowly
in
after
them
in
the
middle
of
the
room
was
a
large
round
table
in
the
center
of
this
table
stood
some
twenty
wax
tapers
in
silver
candlesticks
burning
brightly
and
seated
around
the
table
were
thirteen
men
not
one
of
these
men
moved
as
the
party
came
into
the
room
not
a
limb
nor
muscle
stirred
the
third
coughed
aloud
still
none
of
the
men
moved
so
much
as
a
finger
the
whole
party
came
forward
to
the
table
and
stood
close
behind
the
thirteen
men
and
examined
them
they
were
dead
they
were
sitting
in
all
positions
food
was
before
them
as
if
they
were
in
the
midst
of
a
meal
some
were
leaning
across
the
table
as
if
in
conversation
some
were
in
the
act
of
cutting
meat
on
their
plates
some
in
the
act
of
putting
forks
to
their
mouths
every
face
was
ghastly
white
and
every
eye
was
fixed
in
a
vacant
stare
see
said
toby
in
a
whisper
pointing
to
their
backs
from
the
back
of
each
was
sticking
the
handle
of
a
knife
the
blade
of
which
was
buried
in
the
flesh
to
the
hilt
aunt
amanda
sank
on
toby
shoulder
for
a
moment
but
she
soon
recovered
freddie
grasped
toby
hand
look
said
toby
they
must
be
pirates
each
head
was
bound
with
a
kerchief
and
as
the
horrified
company
examined
the
dead
men
closer
it
was
seen
that
they
all
wore
knee
breeches
a
long
dagger
was
sticking
upright
in
the
table
just
under
the
candles
pinned
by
this
dagger
to
the
table
was
a
large
sheet
of
white
paper
and
there
was
evidently
writing
on
it
the
third
had
apparently
little
fear
of
thirteen
dead
men
he
went
directly
to
the
table
and
reaching
across
between
two
of
the
stiff
figures
drew
the
dagger
from
the
table
and
took
from
the
dagger
point
the
sheet
of
paper
he
adjusted
his
spectacles
turned
his
back
to
the
candles
so
as
to
obtain
a
good
light
on
the
paper
and
read
from
it
aloud
thus
does
captain
lingo
serve
all
traitors
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
then
aunt
amanda
spoke
sharply
the
wicked
villain
said
she
thirteen
of
his
men
dead
at
once
by
his
own
hand
no
wonder
the
six
that
are
left
are
afraid
of
him
no
wonder
they
do
like
this
place
oh
the
wicked
scoundrel
if
i
had
him
here
i
declare
i
would
she
paused
suddenly
and
listened
there
was
a
stealthy
creaking
on
the
stairs
it
grew
more
distinct
then
it
stopped
and
there
was
silence
the
thirteen
in
their
chairs
made
no
motion
whatever
but
the
living
turned
with
one
accord
towards
the
open
doorway
of
the
room
they
waited
with
bated
breath
in
another
moment
captain
lingo
himself
was
standing
in
the
doorway
a
pistol
in
his
right
hand
and
a
knife
in
his
left
without
a
word
he
advanced
into
the
room
and
behind
him
came
his
six
men
shrinking
obviously
away
from
the
sight
of
their
thirteen
murdered
friends
as
captain
lingo
came
to
a
stand
before
his
recent
prisoners
his
eyes
blazed
and
with
his
right
thumb
he
cocked
his
pistol
each
of
his
men
held
a
pistol
in
his
right
hand
and
a
cutlass
in
his
left
and
each
cocked
his
pistol
with
his
thumb
the
third
of
the
society
for
piratical
research
who
seemed
in
no
wise
disconcerted
stepped
forward
and
addressed
the
pirate
captain
lingo
i
presume
ay
ay
be
quick
i
must
finish
this
business
quickly
my
committee
and
myself
have
been
long
anxious
sir
in
the
interest
of
science
to
make
your
acquaintance
i
rejoice
at
this
opportunity
oh
indeed
said
captain
lingo
drily
yes
sir
i
assure
you
i
am
delighted
i
believe
i
have
the
pleasure
of
speaking
to
a
subject
of
king
james
the
second
ay
ay
said
lingo
eyeing
him
suspiciously
what
then
then
the
records
of
our
society
are
vindicated
they
go
back
my
dear
sir
some
two
hundred
years
and
they
contain
from
various
sources
an
unbroken
account
of
captain
lingo
and
his
exploits
from
the
time
of
james
the
second
to
the
present
but
the
sources
of
our
information
were
not
always
reliable
some
doubts
were
thrown
upon
our
records
by
jealous
persons
outside
the
society
and
as
it
is
the
special
business
of
the
committee
on
doubtful
and
fabulous
tales
to
look
into
such
matters
the
committee
is
here
before
you
at
the
present
moment
in
the
interest
of
truth
no
member
of
our
society
has
ever
seen
captain
lingo
and
the
jealous
persons
i
have
mentioned
pretend
that
no
such
person
has
ever
existed
the
chief
mission
of
our
committee
is
to
vindicate
our
records
by
a
sight
of
captain
lingo
himself
thanks
to
you
sir
that
has
now
been
done
our
next
mission
is
to
determine
for
our
society
this
most
important
question
are
you
alive
or
dead
at
this
the
captain
brows
came
together
in
a
terrible
frown
the
scar
across
his
cheek
and
chin
turned
very
white
and
he
glared
under
his
eyebrows
dangerously
at
the
complacent
third
his
lips
parted
showing
his
white
teeth
clenched
tight
together
he
started
to
speak
through
his
clenched
teeth
and
leveled
his
pistol
straight
at
the
third
breast
but
at
that
moment
a
cry
from
the
churchwarden
startled
everybody
bless
my
soul
why
did
i
never
once
think
of
this
before
these
men
ai
real
persons
at
all
how
could
they
be
after
two
hundred
years
they
no
better
than
wicked
spirits
that
what
they
are
wicked
spirits
why
did
we
think
of
that
before
aha
my
fine
friends
got
a
little
medicine
here
for
you
ha
ha
he
drew
forth
from
his
back
pocket
a
little
perfume
bottle
and
waved
it
over
his
head
hurrah
he
cried
hurrah
for
the
odour
of
sanctity
and
with
these
words
the
churchwarden
uncorked
the
bottle
and
sprinkled
a
few
drops
of
his
perfume
on
the
floor
directly
at
the
feet
of
captain
lingo
a
sharp
odour
instantly
filled
the
air
so
sharp
that
it
brought
tears
to
the
eyes
of
everyone
captain
lingo
and
his
men
stepped
quickly
backward
but
it
was
too
late
a
look
of
pained
surprise
crept
over
their
faces
and
remained
fixed
there
their
feet
stood
rooted
to
the
floor
and
the
hands
which
held
the
cutlasses
and
pistols
stiffened
and
became
rigid
not
one
of
them
could
move
an
their
outlines
began
to
waver
their
faces
began
to
be
dim
and
vague
as
if
covered
with
close
white
veils
from
their
outsides
inward
they
slowly
faded
melted
dissolved
nothing
remained
of
any
of
them
but
a
wraith
a
vapor
a
puff
of
smoke
remotely
in
the
shape
of
a
human
being
and
then
that
also
vanished
nothing
remained
the
place
where
they
had
been
was
empty
all
eyes
turned
to
the
table
where
the
thirteen
murdered
pirates
had
been
sitting
they
were
gone
their
chairs
were
vacant
the
churchwarden
calmly
put
the
stopper
in
his
bottle
and
restored
it
to
his
pocket
humph
said
he
nothing
like
odour
of
sanctity
never
knew
it
to
fail
no
harm
to
human
persons
but
no
wicked
spirit
as
ever
lived
can
stand
against
it
and
a
blessed
good
thing
the
bottle
did
break
as
we
came
down
the
no
perfumery
in
this
world
like
odour
of
sanctity
chapter
xix
a
knock
at
the
door
the
third
and
his
of
the
daft
committee
seated
themselves
in
the
chairs
just
vacated
by
the
thirteen
murdered
pirates
nothing
could
have
persuaded
any
of
the
others
to
sit
in
those
dreadful
seats
but
no
feeling
of
this
sort
appeared
to
disturb
the
committee
and
they
evidently
saw
no
reason
why
they
should
not
be
comfortable
the
third
drummed
on
the
table
with
his
fingers
and
frowned
to
himself
in
silence
one
of
the
committee
taking
his
from
his
head
and
smoothing
it
thoughtfully
with
his
hand
glanced
up
at
the
chairman
and
said
i
fear
professor
that
our
hopes
are
dashed
it
is
nothing
less
than
disastrous
you
are
right
my
dear
sir
said
the
chairman
it
is
a
terrible
misfortune
terrible
indeed
and
just
when
we
were
on
the
point
of
what
exclaimed
toby
in
astonishment
do
you
mean
to
say
you
are
sorry
those
rascally
pirates
are
gone
my
dear
sir
said
the
chairman
very
patiently
i
am
finding
no
fault
i
do
not
wish
to
blame
anyone
the
loss
of
these
pirates
to
science
is
one
that
can
never
be
compensated
the
society
for
piratical
research
is
now
at
an
end
there
are
no
other
pirates
on
this
island
and
you
must
see
for
yourselves
that
without
pirates
our
society
must
perish
it
is
a
woful
well
i
never
said
aunt
amanda
of
all
things
do
you
dare
to
sit
there
and
tell
me
you
rather
see
us
all
murdered
by
pirates
than
be
calm
my
friends
said
the
third
placidly
i
have
already
said
that
i
do
not
wish
to
find
fault
i
desire
to
be
generous
it
is
my
wish
in
fact
i
forgive
you
freely
whatever
bitterness
you
may
have
caused
us
we
are
willing
to
believe
that
it
was
not
intentional
the
daft
committee
forgives
you
freely
let
us
be
peaceful
it
only
remains
to
decide
what
steps
we
shall
take
to
meet
the
future
i
submit
to
you
this
question
whether
we
shall
first
go
to
the
pirates
home
in
high
dudgeon
or
return
at
once
to
the
city
of
towers
to
confess
our
failure
and
receive
our
hark
i
thought
i
heard
a
knock
everyone
listened
there
was
indeed
the
sound
of
knocking
muffled
but
quite
audible
the
group
standing
about
the
table
looked
from
one
to
another
in
silence
was
this
some
new
danger
were
there
other
pirates
to
be
reckoned
with
the
churchwarden
put
his
hand
to
his
back
pocket
to
be
ready
with
his
bottle
i
think
it
comes
from
within
this
room
said
the
third
all
eyes
examined
the
room
the
walls
were
unbroken
except
by
on
one
side
the
open
doorway
on
another
and
on
a
third
a
closed
door
which
no
one
had
before
observed
toby
walked
over
to
this
closed
door
and
placed
his
ear
against
it
a
muffled
knock
sounded
from
within
toby
nodded
his
head
to
the
others
and
tried
the
door
it
was
locked
lend
me
your
key
aunt
amanda
said
he
and
when
she
had
given
it
to
him
he
inserted
it
in
the
lock
and
turned
it
and
threw
wide
the
door
inside
was
a
dark
closet
hung
with
cloaks
on
the
floor
sat
a
man
toby
stepped
back
in
amazement
the
man
sat
motionless
his
legs
crossed
gazing
out
into
the
lighted
room
after
a
second
or
two
he
rose
and
stood
in
the
doorway
rubbing
his
eyes
he
said
not
a
word
but
continued
to
rub
his
eyes
until
they
evidently
became
used
to
the
light
and
gave
two
or
three
sniffs
as
if
he
smelt
an
odour
and
found
it
far
from
agreeable
he
was
a
thickset
man
dressed
in
sailor
clothes
in
no
way
like
the
clothes
the
pirates
had
worn
his
eyes
were
small
and
very
close
together
his
nose
was
broken
and
flat
his
lower
jaw
stuck
out
beyond
his
upper
an
unpleasant
fellow
enough
if
looks
were
anything
in
his
belt
he
carried
a
long
knife
his
sailor
collar
was
cut
low
in
front
and
his
chest
was
tattooed
in
red
and
blue
ink
as
he
hesitated
in
the
doorway
sniffing
the
air
uneasily
and
blinking
his
eyes
the
chairman
of
the
daft
committee
spoke
in
his
calm
voice
come
in
my
good
sir
said
he
i
should
like
to
take
the
liberty
of
asking
you
a
few
questions
the
sailorman
walked
slowly
into
the
room
and
looked
about
him
what
that
there
smell
in
the
air
said
he
nothing
only
my
odour
of
sanctity
said
the
churchwarden
i
do
like
it
said
the
sailorman
i
ca
say
that
i
like
it
much
myself
said
the
third
but
it
is
too
faint
now
to
be
disagreeable
pray
be
seated
sir
one
of
the
committee
rose
and
offered
the
sailorman
his
chair
the
sailor
sat
down
and
gazed
at
the
third
who
went
on
with
his
speech
you
need
have
no
fear
sir
if
captain
lingo
causes
you
any
uneasiness
i
may
tell
you
that
he
is
gone
never
to
return
and
all
his
men
with
him
even
the
thirteen
dead
men
who
were
sitting
in
these
chairs
until
a
few
minutes
ago
what
said
the
sailor
has
them
thirteen
men
been
here
all
these
years
my
dear
sir
said
the
third
i
assure
you
we
saw
them
with
our
own
eyes
but
you
will
perhaps
be
kind
enough
to
tell
us
who
you
are
and
how
you
came
to
be
locked
up
in
that
closet
humph
said
the
sailor
hesitating
i
do
know
who
you
are
nor
what
you
doing
in
this
here
place
however
if
lingo
gone
and
oh
well
i
might
as
well
tell
you
by
the
looks
of
you
i
ai
got
much
cause
to
be
afraid
your
courtesy
under
the
circumstances
will
be
much
appreciated
said
the
third
courtesy
be
blowed
said
the
sailorman
well
here
goes
i
matthew
speak

of
the
brig
cotton
mather
out
of
new
bedford
reuben
higginson

cried
aunt
amanda
almost
shrieking
are
you
the
cotton
mather
reuben
higginson
did
you
know
him
it
ai
possible
i
believe
it
it
ai
nothing
to
me
whether
you
believes
it
or
not
i
shipped
with
reuben
higginson
at
new
bedford
and
landed
here
with
him
and
his
crew
on
this
same
identical
island
all
tight
and
safe
here
on
correction
island
as
the
called
it
what
cried
aunt
amanda
again
is
this
correction
island
well
i
never

are
on
correction
island
after
all
and
we
never
knew
it
are
you
sure
that
what
he
called
it
believe
me
or
not
it
ai
nothing
to
me
but
i
seen
it
on
the
map
i
sold
to
mizzen
and
the
wrote
it
there
in
his
own
handwrite
that
all
i
know
but
maybe
if
you
hunt
up
this
here
lemuel
mizzen
a
sailor
with
a
patch
on
one
eye
and
well
of
all
things
exclaimed
aunt
amanda
by
crackey
said
toby
i
would
believed
it
lemuel
mizzen
perhaps
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
tell
us
began
the
third
freddie
said
aunt
amanda
have
you
got
the
map
yes
said
freddie
and
produced
it
from
his
pocket
aunt
amanda
took
it
from
him
and
spread
it
open
on
the
table
before
matthew
speak
the
sailorman
glanced
at
it
and
nodded
his
head
that
it
said
he
i
do
know
how
you
come
by
it
but
that
it
higginson
was
lost
with
the
cotton
mather
in
a
storm
on
his
way
back
to
new
bedford
and
a
lucky
chance
for
me
i
was
aboard
a
good
while
afterwards
a
fisherman
off
of
this
here
island
picked
up
the
map
at
sea
in
a
bottle
and
i
got
it
him
he
squealed
a
good
bit
when
i
stuck
him
but
i
got
it
right
enough
and
then
along
comes
mizzen
me
being
in
hiding
and
i
sold
it
to
him
for
a
set
of
false
whiskers
and
a
yes
yes
said
freddie
eagerly
mizzen
told
me
about
it
when
higginson
sailed
away
from
here
in
the
cotton
mather
i
did
go
with
him
i
ran
away
ay
a
runaway
sailor
that
what
i
am
i
liked
the
spanish
main
and
i
did
like
higginson
nor
yet
he
did
like
me
neither
but
before
he
sailed
i
left
my
mark
on
him
i
did
four
of
his
teeth
out
and
a
black
eye
and
i
wo
say
but
what
he
broke
my
nose
for
me
too
right
enough
for
a
quaker
he
hit
pretty
good
and
i
stole
this
bit
of
writing
from
him
probably
it
ai
no
account
but
higginson
he
seemed
to
set
great
store
by
it
so
i
stole
it
and
here
it
is
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
sheet
of
folded
paper
and
laid
it
on
the
table
beside
the
map
it
was
much
soiled
and
was
evidently
very
old
he
sniffed
the
air
once
or
twice
and
frowned
i
do
like
this
here
smell
it
no
good
i
say
i
do
like
it
it
makes
me
feel
queer
well
i
guess
the
old
man
thought
this
here
bit
of
writing
was
safe
in
his
locker
right
up
to
the
last
i
expect
he
never
missed
it
until
he
went
to
put
it
into
the
bottle
with
the
map
and
throw
it
overboard
he
shook
the
paper
in
his
hand
and
dropped
it
again
on
the
table
and
then
he
went
on
i
fell
in
with
lingo
and
joined
his
crew
look
here
said
toby
how
long
ago
was
all
this
how
do
i
know
said
speak
i
been
shut
up
in
that
there
cupboard
so
long
i
ai
got
no
account
of
time
but
i
remember
just
before
we
sailed
from
new
bedford
there
was
a
lot
of
crazy
people
talkin
about
getting
up
a
fight
with
england
and
breakin
loose
from
her
and
being
free
and
independent
and
what
not
a
great
pack
of
foolish
nonsense
and
something
or
other
about
some
kind
of
a
in
boston
i
dunno
i
ai
never
heard
what
come
of
it
most
likely
nothin
at
all
i
guess
it
must
have
been
a
good
while
ago
i
dunno
the
churchwarden
started
and
put
his
hand
to
his
back
pocket
are
you
as
old
as
that
said
he
no
older
nor
what
you
be
old
said
speak
you
attend
to
your
own
age
and
i
attend
to
mine
never
mind
said
the
third
hastily
pray
tell
us
how
you
came
to
be
locked
up
in
that
closet
gim
me
a
said
speak
i
tell
you
if
you
gim
me
a
i
joined
lingo
i
served
him
true
and
faithful
and
many
a
prize
taken
together
and
watched
many
a
smart
lad
walk
the
plank
that
a
fact
well
thirteen
of
his
men
laid
a
plan
to
go
to
his
where
all
his
treasure
was
hid
and
make
off
with
it
steal
it
ay
ay
steal
it
mind
you
as
bad
as
that
now
me
i
ai
got
no
patience
with
dishonesty
i
all
for
being
honest
i
am
so
being
as
i
had
learned
about
this
here
plan
i
went
and
told
the
captain
he
never
winked
an
eye
not
him
but
off
he
sent
his
other
six
men
out
of
the
way
and
made
a
fine
supper
here
for
them
thirteen
and
sat
down
with
them
to
it
ay
that
he
did
but
first
he
gets
a
little
white
powder
out
of
a
silver
box
and
takes
it
to
mother
ketch
and
orders
her
to
put
it
in
their
food
and
she
wo
not
she
and
nothing
he
can
do
can
make
her
so
he
comes
to
me
and
being
as
i
hates
dishonesty
i
puts
the
powder
in
their
food
and
they
eats
it
only
being
kind
of
nervous
as
you
might
say
i
spills
about
of
it
on
my
way
upstairs
in
the
dark
and
there
ai
enough
left
to
do
the
work
complete
what
was
left
i
put
in
the
food
on
the
table
and
at
that
minute
up
the
stairs
comes
the
whole
thirteen
with
the
captain
at
their
head
and
i
whips
into
that
there
cupboard
and
shuts
the
door
in
my
boots
for
fear
of
what
the
captain
going
to
do
to
me
when
he
finds
out
the
powder
wo
work
only
partly
i
can
hear
all
set
down
to
the
table
laughin
hearty
and
the
captain
voice
jokes
and
makin
feel
at
home
but
after
a
bit
i
do
hear
nobody
voice
but
only
the
captain
because
of
the
white
powder
actin
on
the
others
as
far
as
it
could
and
them
probably
up
stiff
and
in
their
chairs
unable
to
move
a
hand
because
of
the
mite
of
powder
d
see
and
me
quiet
in
the
dark
cupboard
all
over
and
what
the
captain
was
to
do
to
me
and
after
a
bit
i
do
hear
the
captain
voice
no
more
and
there
ai
no
sound
at
all
and
i
guess
the
party
is
over
and
in
another
minute
i
hears
a
key
turn
in
the
lock
of
my
cupboard
door
very
soft
and
easy
and
there
i
am
shut
up
and
locked
in
as
tight
as
pitch
and
there
i
been
ever
since
and
serve
you
jolly
well
right
too
hif
you
arsk
me
said
punch
with
great
disgust
it
the
wickedest
piece
of
business
all
round
i
ever
heard
of
in
my
life
said
aunt
amanda
indignantly
it
my
opinion
you
as
bad
as
any
of
them
worse
if
anything
said
the
churchwarden
whose
hand
was
still
on
his
back
pocket
it
a
pity
the
captain
did
knife
you
in
the
back
with
the
rest
of
said
toby
angrily
speak
little
eyes
flashed
fire
he
drew
his
knife
and
held
it
out
threateningly
in
his
hand
and
started
to
rise
but
he
did
not
rise
he
remained
fixed
in
his
chair
though
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
was
trying
to
get
up
he
sniffed
the
air
and
his
head
remained
fixed
in
the
act
of
sniffing
the
hand
which
held
the
knife
continued
to
hold
it
out
without
moving
a
look
of
alarm
came
into
his
eyes
it
was
evident
that
he
had
smelled
the
odour
of
sanctity
which
yet
lingered
faintly
in
the
room
his
outline
began
to
waver
his
face
became
vague
his
features
ran
together
he
took
on
the
appearance
of
vapor
and
there
in
the
chair
by
the
table
in
place
of
the
thick
and
solid
sailorman
was
an
almost
transparent
form
of
mist
or
smoke
remotely
in
the
shape
of
a
man
everyone
waited
to
see
him
vanish
the
form
still
lingered
it
did
not
disappear
it
continued
to
sit
in
its
chair
with
its
hand
extended
holding
out
a
shadowy
knife
the
odour
of
sanctity
had
lost
its
full
power
and
what
remained
of
it
was
insufficient
to
make
him
disappear
the
churchwarden
pulled
out
his
bottle
and
commenced
to
uncork
it
stay
said
the
third
holding
up
his
hand
i
pray
you
stay
do
not
spill
any
more
of
that
deadly
fluid
there
has
been
enough
destruction
here
tonight
i
propose
that
we
leave
the
late
matthew
speak
as
he
is
he
belongs
to
the
society
for
piratical
research
he
is
the
last
of
the
pirates
and
i
beg
leave
to
claim
him
for
the
society
as
an
exhibit
he
will
be
highly
valued
we
shall
from
time
to
time
conduct
hither
parties
of
the
learned
or
the
curious
to
view
the
last
of
the
pirates
nothing
could
be
better
our
society
is
now
revived
i
am
immensely
gratified
low
dudgeon
shall
be
known
as
the
only
museum
in
the
world
with
but
a
single
exhibit
let
the
late
matthew
speak
repose
here
in
his
chair
as
a
permanent
relic
of
a
bygone
age
the
sole
exhibit
in
a
museum
all
his
own
the
interest
of
such
an
exhibit
will
doubtless
warrant
a
small
charge
at
the
door
the
committee
murmured
an
earnest
approval
the
churchwarden
looked
at
his
companions
and
put
the
bottle
back
into
his
pocket
with
a
sigh
i
thank
you
said
the
third
we
will
now
proceed
to
consider
our
next
step
i
simply
ca
stay
in
this
room
exclaimed
aunt
amanda
with
that
thing
sitting
in
that
chair
it
is
nothing
madam
i
assure
you
said
the
third
see
he
leaned
over
and
passed
his
hand
directly
through
the
body
in
the
chair
in
at
the
breast
and
out
at
the
back
oh
cried
aunt
amanda
and
her
friends
all
gasped
but
the
committee
only
nodded
their
heads
in
token
of
their
interest
you
see
it
is
nothing
said
the
third
we
will
now
look
at
the
paper
which
our
departed
friend
has
left
he
picked
up
the
paper
from
the
table
where
speak
had
left
it
adjusted
his
spectacles
turned
his
back
to
the
candles
so
as
to
get
a
good
light
and
read
the
paper
through
to
himself
he
then
glanced
at
the
company
and
read
aloud
shiraz
the
outside
the
gate
of
wanderers
six
hundred
paces
to
the
right
along
the
wall
thee
shall
know
his
shop
by
certain
numbers
to
wit
if
he
hide
himself
say
these
words
shagli
jamshid
shahriman
thee
shall
buy
of
his
wares
not
that
which
he
shall
offer
first
nor
second
but
that
which
he
shall
offer
third
that
thee
shall
buy
and
for
that
thee
shall
pay
whatever
he
shall
demand
thereafter
thee
shall
do
whatever
he
shall
direct
but
enter
not
into
the
city
but
by
the
shop
of
shiraz
the
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
then
aunt
amanda
said
that
the
way
we
are
to
get
those
wonderful
things
the
map
speaks
of
it
does
seem
to
tell
us
much
though
where
do
you
suppose
is
this
gate
of
wanderers
that
dear
madam
said
the
third
is
one
of
the
gates
of
our
city
of
towers
we
know
it
very
well
of
course
then
said
aunt
amanda
as
captain
of
my
party
my
orders
is
that
we
go
there
at
once
much
good
would
that
do
said
toby
we
got
to
buy
something
of
this
here
shiraz
if
that
his
name
and
pay
anything
he
asks
too
and
there
ai
a
penny
amongst
us
how
could
we
buy
anything
the
pirates
treasure
cried
freddie
the
pirates
treasure
in
the
cave
by
crackey
said
toby
i
clean
forgot
all
about
it
good
for
you
freddie
talk
about
money
to
buy
things
with
we
buy
out
that
old
shiraz
whole
shop
the
treasure
belongs
to
us
as
sure
as
you
born
by
crickets
we
in
luck
if
you
will
pardon
me
said
the
third
we
know
nothing
of
any
treasure
and
if
you
would
be
so
good
as
to
i
will
said
aunt
amanda
and
she
quickly
explained
the
whole
matter
the
daft
committee
including
its
chairman
was
much
impressed
we
do
not
wish
to
intrude
said
the
chairman
but
if
we
could
be
of
any
service
of
course
cried
toby
you
got
to
help
us
get
the
treasure
out
of
the
cave
and
then
help
us
to
find
the
city
of
towers
and
if
help
us
why
what
i
say
is
the
committee
ought
to
have
a
share
of
the
treasure
is
that
right
toby
friends
willingly
agreed
and
the
committee
gladly
consented
to
go
with
them
to
the
treasure
cave
and
then
to
the
city
of
towers
the
society
for
piratical
research
said
the
third
is
coming
back
to
life
we
now
have
a
museum
with
one
exhibit
and
we
are
about
to
acquire
a
fund
of
money
come
my
friends
it
is
time
to
depart
if
you
will
go
out
first
i
will
remain
and
blow
out
the
candles
we
must
remember
to
close
the
door
behind
us
for
a
draught
of
air
would
probably
blow
the
late
matthew
speak
out
of
the
window
in
a
few
moments
the
whole
party
was
standing
in
the
moonlight
on
the
grass
before
the
deserted
tower
of
low
dudgeon
not
quite
deserted
however
in
every
mind
was
a
picture
of
a
misty
and
vapory
form
remotely
in
the
shape
of
a
man
sitting
motionless
in
a
chair
beside
a
table
in
a
dark
and
silent
room
all
right
said
toby
now
for
the
treasure
cave
and
the
city
of
towers
chapter
xx
the
city
of
towers
at
the
pirates
cave
the
task
of
getting
out
the
treasure
proved
very
difficult
but
it
was
done
at
last
the
committee
camp
in
the
forest
had
supplied
abundance
of
provisions
and
a
great
number
of
animals
the
committee
traveled
in
luxury
on
the
level
ground
where
hanlon
had
given
his
exhibition
of
the
toilers
were
now
resting
in
the
hot
sun
and
drying
their
garments
thoroughly
soaked
by
their
trips
in
and
out
of
the
cave
under
the
they
looked
with
intense
delight
on
the
boxes
and
bags
which
lay
before
them
what
i
say
is
said
toby
let
divide
the
treasure
now
so
we
have
to
bother
about
it
when
we
get
to
the
city
of
towers
how
beautiful
is
nature
said
the
sly
old
codger
behold
that
wide
expanse
of
field
and
forest
resting
so
so
expansively
beneath
the
orb
of
day
a
true
true
work
of
nature
at
such
a
moment
as
this
dear
friends
a
warm
feeling
invades
my
heart
a
feeling
of
of
did
i
hear
a
suggestion
to
divide
the
treasure
the
division
was
carefully
made
and
when
it
was
done
and
each
person
had
declared
himself
well
satisfied
each
share
was
packed
separately
and
the
treasure
loaded
on
the
backs
of
the
extra
mules
it
was
a
princely
fortune
do
you
suppose
said
the
old
codger
with
the
wooden
leg
that
er
i
shall
be
able
to
obtain
in
the
city
of
towers
such
a
thing
as
a
pipeful
ahem
a
pipeful
of
tobacco
never
fear
said
the
third
i
fancy
you
will
be
able
to
buy
there
all
the
tobacco
you
can
use
wery
sorry
i
am
to
it
said
punch
hi
regard
the
tobacco
as
a
wery
reprehensible
wery
oh
you
do
said
toby
glaring
at
him
wery
reprehensible
indeed
went
on
punch
calmly
my
conscience
troubled
me
for
a
long
time
by
reason
of
my
position
in
the
tobacco
trade
being
posted
as
one
may
in
a
wery
hadwantageous
position
for
hobserwation
i
seen
too
much
entirely
too
much
of
the
sad
effects
of
the
hobnoxious
weed
many
a
time
i
wept
to
myself
when
the
hobserver
may
thought
it
was
only
rain
on
me
cheek
to
see
young
and
hold
going
in
and
hout
of
toby
littleback
shop
knowing
what
would
come
of
it
sooner
or
later
and
me
there
hencouraging
of
in
as
one
may
with
me
packet
of
cigars
in
me
hoften
enough
i
wished
to
give
it
hup
and
embark
in
a
hoccupation
less
reprehensible
many
a
time
i
said
to
myself
hif
i
could
only
be
hinnocent
once
just
once
and
now
hi
shall
put
me
hall
the
of
me
sinful
past
and
with
my
share
of
the
treasure
hi
shall
open
a
shop
for
the
purveying
of
tripe
there
a
deal
more
harm
been
done
by
tripe
than
ever
there
was
by
tobacco
said
toby
there
is
a
total
absence
of
nicotine
in
tripe
said
punch
loftily
at
least
such
is
my
hinformation
and
i
car
that
my
friend
littleback
will
reform
hisself
now
that
can
afford
it
and
engage
in
some
pursuit
less
to
the
young
hif
i
was
arsked
i
would
suggest
pinking
and
pleating
you
ai
been
asked
said
toby
i
can
see
myself
pinking
and
pleating
when
i
want
advice
what
to
do
with
my
money
i
ask
you
tobacco
is
my
line
and
tobacco
is
going
to
be
my
line
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
and
that
flat
pinking
and
pleating
humph
it
my
belief
said
the
churchwarden
after
listening
to
what
been
said
pro
and
con
backwards
and
forwards
up
and
down
that
if
we
start
for
the
city
of
towers
we
never
get
there
and
what
more
said
toby
when
i
get
back
i
going
to
have
an
outside
my
door
instead
of
a
excuse
me
said
the
third
i
am
sorry
to
interrupt
this
interesting
discussion
but
we
really
ought
to
be
going
gentlemen
to
the
committee
our
steeds
are
waiting
to
the
city
of
towers
the
journey
which
now
commenced
proved
to
be
a
very
long
one
day
after
day
the
pilgrims
plodded
through
a
wilderness
of
forest
and
field
over
streams
across
mountains
down
into
deep
valleys
and
up
again
camping
at
night
wherever
they
happened
to
find
water
and
wood
and
sleeping
under
the
stars
in
blankets
on
beds
of
boughs
the
moon
was
gone
before
their
journey
was
over
one
morning
the
trail
brought
them
down
on
a
to
a
road
this
road
they
followed
for
some
hours
and
it
brought
them
finally
to
the
top
of
a
gentle
hill
covered
with
trees
from
the
top
of
this
hill
they
saw
a
striking
scene
stretching
away
from
the
foot
of
the
hill
lay
a
great
rolling
valley
up
which
the
road
ran
as
straight
as
a
ribbon
far
away
at
the
end
of
the
road
against
a
dark
wooded
mountain
stood
a
great
city
walled
around
with
a
high
wall
and
shining
in
the
sun
with
white
and
gold
domes
and
turrets
and
towers
the
rear
of
the
city
rose
along
the
lower
slope
of
the
mountain
and
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
concealing
its
peak
lay
a
cloud
black
below
and
glittering
with
sunlight
at
the
edges
it
hung
there
motionless
during
the
time
when
the
watchers
sat
watching
the
scene
directly
under
the
cloud
on
the
slope
where
the
farthest
portion
of
the
city
lay
was
an
open
space
among
the
buildings
like
a
great
garden
or
park
and
in
the
midst
of
it
a
vast
white
building
with
a
flat
roof
great
enough
for
the
palace
of
a
king
that
which
struck
the
strangers
most
at
their
first
look
was
the
great
number
of
towers
which
rose
at
all
points
in
the
city
surely
so
many
towers
had
never
been
gotten
together
in
one
place
before
and
the
most
remarkable
one
of
them
was
the
tower
which
rose
from
just
behind
the
great
white
building
in
the
park
it
was
dull
in
colour
and
doubtless
of
brick
it
was
round
in
shape
tapering
gradually
upwards
it
rose
to
a
height
which
none
of
the
strangers
would
have
thought
possible
had
they
not
seen
it
with
their
own
eyes
it
rose
straight
to
the
cloud
which
hung
motionless
upon
the
mountain
it
pierced
the
cloud
and
its
top
was
lost
to
view
in
the
cloud
or
above
it
the
city
of
towers
said
the
third
waving
his
arm
in
that
direction
the
gate
of
wanderers
is
before
us
at
the
end
of
the
road
the
party
urged
their
animals
forward
down
the
and
pressed
on
until
noon
when
they
halted
for
rest
and
refreshment
in
a
wood
beside
the
road
there
they
sat
at
their
ease
on
the
grass
and
the
third
looked
from
one
to
another
and
spoke
as
follows
my
friends
i
must
tell
you
the
story
of
the
towers
our
king
you
must
know
is
a
handsome
and
amiable
man
in
appearance
about
thirty
years
of
age
when
i
tell
you
that
he
has
been
our
king
for
more
than
forty
years
you
will
be
surprised
his
wife
was
a
princess
of
some
few
years
less
than
his
own
and
of
a
beauty
unequalled
in
the
kingdom
her
wedding
ring
the
gift
of
her
husband
was
a
single
ruby
in
a
plain
gold
band
and
this
ring
she
was
never
known
to
remove
from
her
for
a
single
moment
she
was
blessed
with
three
beautiful
children
two
boys
and
a
girl
the
oldest
of
whom
was
nearly
nine
years
of
age
when
the
prince
our
present
king
was
thirty
years
old
his
father
the
king
who
was
then
alive
gave
a
great
ball
at
the
palace
and
at
this
ball
the
old
king
declared
to
the
assembled
court
that
he
desired
to
build
a
tower
a
mighty
tower
higher
than
any
other
in
the
world
where
he
might
seek
repose
from
time
to
time
a
tower
so
tall
that
it
would
reach
the
cloud
that
hangs
perpetually
on
the
mountain
to
him
who
should
build
such
a
tower
in
the
shortest
time
the
king
would
give
any
reward
which
the
fortunate
bidder
might
ask
the
old
king
laughed
as
he
made
his
offer
and
it
was
plain
that
he
was
only
half
serious
but
many
of
the
richest
of
his
nobility
desired
the
prize
and
contended
for
it
earnestly
one
proposed
to
erect
the
tower
in
ten
years
another
in
eight
and
one
was
found
who
was
willing
to
promise
it
in
six
years
and
a
half
but
these
terms
were
all
too
long
the
king
was
old
and
he
would
not
wait
so
long
there
no
one
said
the
old
king
at
last
will
build
me
my
tower
in
less
than
six
years
and
a
half
will
build
it
in
one
night
said
a
voice
from
the
rear
of
the
an
old
man
came
forward
and
stood
before
the
king
an
old
man
dressed
in
a
short
gown
tied
in
with
a
cord
about
the
middle
with
sandals
on
his
feet
a
lantern
with
a
lighted
candle
in
one
hand
and
a
staff
in
the
other
no
one
in
that
place
had
ever
seen
him
before
and
no
one
knew
how
he
had
gotten
in
amongst
that
glittering
company
will
build
your
tower
in
one
night
said
the
old
man
the
old
king
laughed
outright
but
he
accepted
the
offer
then
and
there
the
morning
said
he
we
find
the
tower
finished
you
shall
have
any
gift
which
may
be
in
my
power
to
give
the
old
man
bowed
and
made
his
way
slowly
out
of
the
palace
a
great
shout
of
laughter
went
up
from
the
company
and
in
this
the
king
himself
joined
heartily
but
the
joke
was
as
i
must
tell
you
my
friends
that
in
the
morning
when
the
king
rose
there
stood
the
tower
in
fact
behind
the
palace
so
tall
that
its
top
could
not
be
seen
in
the
cloud
that
hung
upon
the
mountain
and
there
my
friends
the
tower
stands
to
this
day
that
evening
the
old
man
returned
for
his
reward
he
stood
before
the
king
and
on
the
king
right
and
left
stood
the
prince
and
the
wife
and
children
the
king
asked
the
old
man
what
reward
he
desired
ask
nothing
replied
the
other
with
a
sly
smile
the
ruby
ring
upon
the
finger
of
the
princess
the
princess
turned
pale
and
hid
her
hand
behind
her
she
would
not
give
up
her
nothing
the
king
could
say
could
move
her
he
offered
the
old
man
anything
else
he
might
demand
a
dozen
ruby
rings
a
box
of
ruby
rings
anything
but
the
old
man
would
have
nothing
but
the
ring
upon
the
princess
finger
the
princess
grew
paler
still
as
if
with
fear
but
she
would
not
give
up
the
ring
the
old
man
smiled
his
sly
smile
again
and
went
away
the
next
morning
the
princess
and
her
three
children
were
gone
search
was
made
everywhere
but
they
were
not
to
be
found
the
king
and
the
prince
mounting
the
winding
stair
of
the
tower
stopped
at
last
when
they
were
all
but
exhausted
and
at
that
moment
heard
a
sound
of
weeping
from
above
they
climbed
higher
and
on
the
stair
they
found
the
children
sitting
huddled
together
and
weeping
bitterly
their
mother
was
gone
they
knew
not
where
and
they
did
not
know
how
they
came
to
be
in
the
tower
the
strongest
climbers
in
the
city
mounted
as
far
as
they
could
ascend
but
the
top
of
the
tower
was
far
beyond
their
reach
they
found
no
princess
she
has
never
been
seen
from
that
day
soon
after
the
old
king
died
and
his
son
came
to
the
throne
as
for
him
our
present
king
and
his
three
children
time
stopped
for
them
from
the
day
on
which
the
princess
disappeared
they
are
no
older
now
than
when
she
left
them
it
is
supposed
that
they
are
awaiting
her
return
unchanged
in
order
that
she
may
not
find
them
old
on
her
return
if
she
should
still
be
young
there
are
those
who
say
that
she
has
lived
all
these
years
and
still
lives
somewhere
in
some
strange
form
perhaps
far
from
here
bewitched
by
the
old
man
and
waiting
for
release
from
her
enchantment
i
do
not
know
and
what
was
her
name
said
aunt
amanda
she
was
named
said
the
third
the
princess
miranda
and
what
are
all
those
other
towers
in
the
city
said
aunt
amanda
it
was
the
fashion
after
the
king
tower
was
built
to
build
towers
the
king
as
you
may
suppose
sets
the
fashion
in
all
things
but
no
more
are
built
nowadays
the
thing
had
its
day
and
died
out
there
is
a
fashion
now
in
they
are
modeled
after
the
built
by
kubla
khan
in
xanadu
well

stretched
away
to
a
great
distance
on

were
going
in
and
out
at
the
gate
some
on
foot
driving
donkeys
before
them
some
on

some
in

and
all
brisk
and
talkative
the
third
received
a
respectful
greeting
from
several
of
those
on
horseback
he
turned
to
his
companions
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
and
said
the
wanderers
bazaar
on
each
side
of
the
open
gate
at
the
foot
of
the
high
thick
wall
was
what
appeared
to
be
a
fair
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
the
base
of
the
wall
was
lined
with
booths
each
with
an
awning
over
it
from
the
wall
behind
gaily
striped
in
orange
and
blue
and
yellow
and
brown
in
these
booths

spread
out
in

profusion
a
mass
of
merchandise
of

and
silver

and
copper
vessels
rugs
and

a

twirling
his
wheel
in
another
a
laying
little
sticks
down
in
curious
patterns
on
his
table
in
another
a
man
pasting
on
cards
bits
of
coloured
feathers
in
the
form
of
tiny
birds
and
fowls
most
in
another
a
delicately
twining
a
thread
of
spun
glass
for
the
rigging
of
a
ship
in
another
a
man
sitting
on
a
rug
with
a
snake
before
him
whose
flat
head
stood
stiffly
up
from
his
coil
and
waved
a
little
to
the
motion
of
his
master
finger
in
another
a
man
was
bending
over
a
with
a
wand
in
his
hand
and
as
he
moved
the
wand
a
stalk
grew
from
the
pot
and
at
its
end
a
bud
appeared
and
unfolded
into
a
flower
before
the
very
eyes
of
his
audience
in
another
a
great
ape
was
marking
down
figures
with
chalk
as
his
master
called
them
in
another
a
shuttle
was
weaving
back
and
forth
in
a
loom
there
seemed
to
be
no
end
to
the
curious
and
diverting
things
to
be
seen
in
those
booths
the
people
in
them
were
apparently
of
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
there
were
brown
men
and
yellow
men
and
black
men
as
well
as
white
men
with
slant
eyes
with
round
eyes
with
flat
noses
with
with
wooly
hair
with
straight
hair
there
were
turbans
and
fezzes
and
hoods
and
white
gowns
and
coloured
robes
and
velvet
jackets
and
cotton
blouses
and
from
all
the
venders
rose
such
a
hubbub
as
freddie
had
never
in
his
life
heard
before
except
once
in
the
gaunt
street
theatre
at
home
a
lively
crowd
chaffered
with
the
venders
and
walked
in
the
paved
street
before
their
booths
it
was
a
scene
full
of
life
and
colour
and
freddie
was
transported
with
delight
oh

said

sly
old

our
mules
enough
treasure
to
buy
this
whole
bazaar

beautiful
thought

the
sly
old

look
at
the
paper

aunt

in
an
exasperated
tone
everyone

at
everyone
else
to
produce
the
paper
but
no
one
produced
it
i
regret
to
confess
it
said
the
third
placidly
but
i
have
a
distinct
recollection
of
having
left
it
on
the
table
at
low
dudgeon

without
any
sign
of
worry
that

at
low
dudgeon
with
the
other
paper
merciful

the
third

persian
and
i
am
accordingly
familiar
with
them
jamshid
shahriman
am
i
right
gentlemen
the
daft
committee
nodded
their
heads
in
assent
then
i

reason
said
the
third
why
we
should
not
proceed
come
on
then
said
toby
i
get
down
and
pace
off
the
six
hundred
steps
and
see
where
we
come
to
the
party
moved
slowly
through
the
crowd
along
the
booths
while
toby
walked
beside
them
carefully
counting
his
steps
five
hundred
and
eighty
said
he
five
hundred
and
ninety
six
hundred
and
stopped
the
procession
stopped
also
and
all
of
the
riders
got
down
from
their
mules
many
of
the
gazed
curiously
at
them
and
some
paused
for
a
moment
before
going
on
but
no
one
seemed
to
take
more
than
a
passing
interest
one
of
the
committee
led
the
mules
to
the
open
side
of
the
street
where
they
would
be
out
of
the
way
and
stood
guard
over
them
the
others
joined
toby
in
front
of
the
booth
at
which
he
was
now
standing
it
was
not
the
kind
of
booth
they
were
seeking
at
all
there
were
no
rugs
nor
carpets
of
any
kind
only
clocks
and
watches
a
great
number
of
them
and
a
few
sundials
and
behind
the
counter
stood
a
lad
of
about
twenty
very
dark
of
skin
with
snapping
black
eyes
and
shining
white
teeth
which
showed
as
he
now
bowed
and
smiled
a
white
turban
on
his
head
and
a
loose
white
robe
hanging
from
his
shoulders
he
was
slim
and
sleek
and
his
fingers
were
very
long
and
delicate
he
rubbed
his
hands
together
as
the
riders
dismounted
and
commenced
to
chatter
to
them
in
an
unknown
tongue
bowing
and
smiling
the
while
his
wares
were
displayed
about
him
on
shelves
and
boxes
and
tables
as
well
as
on
the
counter
and
the
clocks
and
watches
as
usual
in
such
places
showed
all
hours
of
the
twelve
a
striped
awning
of
orange
and
blue
fastened
at
the
rear
to
the
side
of
the
city
wall
shielded
him
and
his
booth
from
the
sun
behind
him
in
the
wall

a
closed
iron
door

the
young

looking
puzzled
and
shaking
his
head
clocks
and

by
crackey
said
toby
we
in
the
wrong
place
sure
enough
now
while
this
talk
was
going
on
freddie
had
made
a
discovery
he
had
noticed
on
a
box
at
the
rear
against
the
wall
a
row
of
seven
old
clocks
they
were
battered
and
broken
and
were
evidently
long
since
out
of
repair
two
of
them
had
no
hands
like
most
of
the
clocks
in
the
place
they
were
stopped
and
had
probably
from
the
looks
of
them
ceased
many
years
before
to
keep
time
he
noted
idly
the
time
shown
by
each
of
these
clocks
and
started
in
surprise
the
hour
shown
by
the
first
clock
at
the
left
was
three
that
shown
by
the
next
was
one
the
next
had
no
hands
and
showed
no
time
at
all
the
next
showed
one
the
next
three
the
next
one
and
the
seventh
had
no
hands
he
ran
his
eye
over
them
again
and
the
numbers
which
resulted
were
come
along
said
toby
we
might
as
well
ask
at
some
of
these
other
shops
there
ai
no
use
wasting
time
here
he
moved
away
and
the
others
followed
him
towards
the
adjoining
booth
the
teeth
of
the
dark
young
man
shone
white
and
he
bowed
politely
to
the
departing
strangers
freddie
pulled
at
toby
coat
and
whispered
in
his
ear
toby
listened
and
without
a
word
led
the
party
back
to
the
booth
now
see
here
young
feller
said
he
i
got
your
number
and
i
do
want
no
nonsense
i
reckon
you
can
understand
numbers
if
you
ca
understand
anything
else
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
row
of
old
clocks
at
the
rear
listen
to
this
my
young
friend
the
smile
left
the
young
man
face
he
seemed
a
trifle
uneasy
his
long
fingers
rested
on
the
counter
and
he
leaned
forward
intently
no
understand
said
he
by
crackey
said
toby
this
beats
all
where
shiraz
we
in
the
right
place
and
we
want
shiraz
out
with
him
clocks
and
watches
said
the
young
man
but
this
time
somewhat
nervously
you
buy
buy
nothing
cried
toby
we
want
to
see
shiraz
the
professor
said
he
turning
round
what
the
words
to
bring
out
shiraz
the
shagli
jamshid
shahriman
said
the
third
in
a
loud
voice
instantly
the
manner
of
the
young
man
changed
crossing
his
arms
upon
his
breast
he
made
a
low
salaam
and
spoke
with
the
utmost
deference
i
trust
you
will
pardon
said
he
my
seeming
lack
of
courtesy
it
is
necessary
to
exercise
a
certain
caution
there
are
wicked
spirits
assuming
from
time
to
time
the
most
unlikely
forms
who
seek
to
gain
access
to
my
his
life
is
continually
in
danger
for
he
possesses
secrets
which
enable
him
constantly
to
interfere
with
their
designs
by
reason
of
this
danger
he
was
obliged
many
years
ago
to
retire
from
the
rug
business
and
he
has
lived
ever
since
in
deep
seclusion
it
is
your
wish
to
see
shiraz
the
persian
you
seem
to
speak
english
pretty
good
said
toby
perfectly
my
lord
and
twelve
other
tongues
as
well
you
desire
to
see
my
that
the
exact
idea
said
toby
then
i
will
beg
your
indulgence
for
a
few
moments
the
young
man
bowed
again
and
disappeared
through
the
doorway
in
the
wall
closing
the
door
behind
him
after
a
considerable
absence
he
returned
if
you
will
follow
me
said
he
i
will
conduct
you
to
my
we
will
await
your
return
here
said
the
third
to
toby
and
his
companions
it
is
unnecessary
for
us
to
pursue
this
adventure
further
the
third
and
his
friends
returned
to
the
mules
and
the
others
followed
the
young
man
to
the
door
behind
him
in
the
wall
the
door
was
closed
and
locked
behind
them
and
they
found
themselves
in
darkness
if
you
will
come
to
me
here
said
the
voice
of
the
young
man
a
little
in
advance
i
will
show
you
the
way
down
when
they
felt
themselves
near
him
they
heard
his
voice
again
be
good
enough
to
step
carefully
forward
until
you
feel
the
first
step
of
a
descending
stair
then
descend
cautiously
if
you
please
each
one
put
out
a
foot
and
in
a
moment
they
were
all
going
down
a
stairway
of
which
the
treads
were
evidently
of
stone
much
worn
when
they
had
gone
down
some
thirty
steps
they
were
aware
that
the
stair
had
ended
and
that
they
were
on
a
landing
you
will
now
cross
the
bridge
one
by
one
holding
on
to
the
railing
said
the
voice
of
the
young
man
one
by
one
the
party
stepped
forward
feeling
the
way
cautiously
and
as
each
in
turn
found
with
his
hand
a
slight
wooden
railing
a
breath
of
fresh
air
blew
upon
his
face
and
the
sound
of
rushing
water
came
from
below
instead
of
the
firm
stone
they
had
just
been
treading
they
were
conscious
of
wooden
planking
under
their
feet
and
it
gave
beneath
their
pressure
most
uneasily
the
bridge
was
a
long
one
and
the
sound
of
rushing
water
followed
them
its
entire
length
they
walked
again
however
on
firm
ground
and
heard
the
young
voice
before
them
be
good
enough
to
follow
the
right
hand
wall
it
said
and
turn
with
the
wall
each
right
hand
touched
the
surface
of
a
wall
and
in
a
moment
the
wall
made
a
turning
to
the
right
in
another
moment
their
progress
was
barred
by
a
wall
in
advance
and
the
voice
of
the
young
man
spoke
from
their
midst
you
will
kindly
stoop
as
you
go
in
said
he
and
at
the
same
moment
a
round
opening
appeared
before
them
dimly
lit
from
within
it
was
only
large
enough
to
admit
a
single
person
stooping
the
young
man
entered
first
and
the
others
followed
one
by
one
when
they
were
all
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
the
young
man
swung
it
noiselessly
to
on
its
hinges
and
it
was
seen
that
it
fitted
accurately
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
it
from
the
wall
they
were
in
a
small
room
unfurnished
except
for
a
table
in
the
center
on
which
burned
an
oil
lamp
of
silver
in
shape
like
a
boat
the
walls
were
bare
except
for
certain
shelves
containing
bottles
of
coloured
liquids
other
bottles
of
coloured
powders
mortars
retorts
and
huge
dusty
books
there
appeared
to
be
no
outlet
from
the
room
but
the
young
man
pressed
his
finger
on
a
spot
behind
one
of
the
bottles
on
a
shelf
and
a
circular
door
like
the
one
by
which
they
had
entered
swung
slowly
open
in
the
opposite
wall
we
have
arrived
said
the
young
man
please
to
follow
he
stooped
and
entered
the
circular
doorway
and
the
others
one
by
one
followed
they
found
themselves
in
a
rich
and
luxurious
apartment
softly
lighted
by
a
hanging
lamp
in
the
center
was
a
table
littered
with
open
books
and
scrolls
of
paper
and
bearing
notably
a
great
round
globe
of
solid
crystal
beside
the
table
on
a
divan
reclined
what
appeared
to
be
a
dry
and
shriveled
mummy

this
is
my
said
the
young
man
the
room
in
which
they
stood
was
hung
about
on
all
the
walls
with
rare
and
beautiful
rugs
and
similar
rugs
covered
the
floor
richly
embroidered
cushions
and
delicate
silk
and
cashmere
shawls
lay
on
the
few
easy
chairs
that
were
disposed
about
the
room
the
bowl
of
the
hanging
lamp
above
the
table
was
of
bits
of
amber
and
orange
and
ruby
glass
through
which
shone
a
subdued
and
mellow
light
near
the
ceiling
were
three
or
four
small
openings
covered
with
iron
gratings
and
the
air
in
the
apartment
was
pure
except
for
the
odour
of
tobacco
the
figure
on
the
divan
was
smoking
a
pipe
a
whose
long
flexible
stem
reached
to
the
floor
where
its
bowl
rested

at
his

with
little
beady

his
skin
was
very
dark
and
shriveled
and
wrinkled
like
the
skin
of
a
dried
apple
his
seemed
as
if
about
to
break
through
his
cheeks
and
his
lips
were
stretched
back
from
his
teeth
which
were
black
and
broken
his
hands
were
like
the
claws
of
a
bird
thin
white
hair
straggled
over
his

scalp
he
wore
a
robe
of
some
soft
material
harmoniously
mottled
upon
a
ground
of
maroon

the
looked
at

with

he
was
the
smallest
man
the
strangers
had
ever
seen
after
a
searching
look
at
them
with
his
beady
eyes
he
rose
from
the
divan
laid
down
the
stem
of
his
pipe
and
stood
up
he
was
not
taller
than
freddie
as
he
stood
by
the
divan
looking
up
at
his
visitors
he
seemed
indeed
a
mere
mummy
of
a
man
likely
to
fall
to
pieces
at
a
breath
of
air
you
are
welcome
he
said
in
a
voice
surprisingly
strong
i
perceive
that
you
have
come
from
a
great
distance
permit
me
to
inquire
what
errand
has
brought
you
to
your
servant
poor
habitation
i
reckon
we
want
to
buy
something

give
us
the
direction
as
you
might
say
ah
yes
said
shiraz
the
persian
i
remember
him
very
well
i
was
sorry
to
learn
of
his
misfortune
an
excellent
man
a
member
of
some
strange
sect
a
quaker
said
toby
the
paper
he

buy
something
here
and
here

i
have
long
since

from

rug
business
said
shiraz
but
i
have
brought
with
me
here
as
you
may
see
some
of
my
choicest
treasures
as
a
slight
solace
in
my
seclusion
he
glanced
towards
the
rugs
on
the
walls
i
am
reluctant
to
part
with
any
of
them
but
i
am
willing
to
make
an
exception
in
view
of
your
having
made
so
long
a
journey
to
see
me
my
son
said
he
to
the
young
man
bring
hither
the
omar
the
young
man
took
from
one
of
the
walls
a
small
rug
and
laid
it
at
the
feet
of
shiraz
you
will
immediately
perceive
said
the
persian
the
extreme
beauty
of
this
rug
it
is
one
of
my
rarest
treasures
it
is
a
from
the
mosque
of
omar
at
isfahan
a
kalicheh
of
fabric
with
the
sehna
knot
as
i
need
not
tell
you
made
in
kurdistan
three
hundred
years
ago
observe
if
you
please
the
delicacy
of
the
design
and
the
harmony
of
the
colouring
its
possession
is
as
a
spring
of
water
to
the
desert
bedouin
as
a
palm
with
dates
on
the
road
to
mecca
as
a
word
to
the
believer
from
the
mouth
of
the
prophet
its
price
to
those
who
have
journeyed
across
the
sea
to
buy
it
is
twelve
copper
pennies
the
sly
old
fox
stooped
down
and
examined
it
his
eyes
lit
up
with
pleasure
beautiful
said
he
i
have
never
seen
a
rug
more
beautiful
it
is
a
real
work
of
of
i
will
take
it
at
twelve
pennies
it
is
mine
no

said
aunt
amanda

nothing
of
the
kind
it
is
certainly
the
finest
piece
of
carpet
i
have
ever
seen
and
the
price
is
low
enough
in
all
conscience
but
we
are
not
going
to
buy
it
i
am
sorry
sir
but
we
ca
buy
your
rug

us
something
else
shiraz
displayed
his
teeth
more
plainly
than
ever
in
a
sly
smile
your
servant
is
desolated
he
replied
i
crave
your
pardon
for
showing
a
trifle
so
far
beneath
your
notice
my
son
take
it
away
if
your
excellencies
will
deign
to
overlook
my
error
i
will
produce
an
article
more
worthy
of
your
attention
this
time
i
promise
myself
the
ecstasy
of
your
approval
pretty
good
line
of
talk
whispered
toby
in
punch
ear
my
son
continued
shiraz
bring
hither
the
wishing
rug
the
young
man
took
away
the
and
brought
another
from
the
wall
a
much
larger
one
large
enough
indeed
for
twenty
people
to
stand
on
it
was
dingy
and
frayed
and
in
no
way
beautiful
like
the
other
a
rug
of
the
tomb
of
rustam
said
shiraz
gained
by
the
hero
in
battle
from
the
genie
akhnavid
it
is
the
last
of
the
wishing
rugs
its
property
is
that
it
will
transport
to
the
farthest
regions
of
the
earth
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
those
who
sit
upon
it
and
but
name
aloud
the
place
of
their
desire
excellencies
he
said
addressing
his
visitors
very
earnestly
if
it
is
your
wish
to
return
home
the
moment
has
arrived
you
have
only
to
sit
upon
this
rug
and
wish
yourselves
at
home
and
you
will
find
yourselves
there
safe
and
sound
before
the
words
shall
have
well
left
your
lips
and
the
price
is
only
twenty
pennies
every
one
of
the
party
hesitated
a
vision
of
the
old
tobacco
shop
entered
each
mind
it
had
never
seemed
so
cozy
so
quiet
so
secure
as
at
that
moment
how
or
when
they
would
ever
get
there
in
the
natural
course
of
events
no
one
knew
if
they
did
not
seize
this
opportunity
they
might
be
lost
forever
it
was
a
chance
such
as
they
could
scarcely
have
hoped
for
could
we
take
our
belongings
with
us
said
the
sly
old
fox
all
that
can
be
piled
on
the
rug
said
shiraz
then
i
will
buy
it
said
the
sly
old
codger
i
do
not
consider
twenty
pennies
too
much
for
such
a
rug
the
rug
is
mine
it
nothing
of
the
sort
said
aunt
amanda
waking
from
deep
thought

of
this
expedition
and

mortified
i
do
not
know
how
i
could
have
made
such
a
mistake
he
said
i
should
have
known
that
these
little
trifles
could
not
interest
you
i
trust
you
will
believe
that
i
meant
no
offense
i
fear
there
is
nothing
in
my
poor
collection
which
merits
your
notice
permit
me
to
wish
you
a
safe
journey
do
you
intend
to
remain

in
the
city
of

he
i
do
said
she
to

to

shiraz
i
tremble
to
think
how
contemptible
are
the
baubles

shall
now
offer
you
but
i
trust
you
will
not
be
angry
with
your
servant
he
turned
to
the
young
man
and
spoke
to
him
in
an
unknown
tongue
be
not
offended
excellencies
he
went
on
by
your
poor
servant
ignorance
in
the
art
of
pleasing
the
young
man
disappeared
behind
one
of
the
hanging
rugs
and
in
a
moment
returned
with
certain
small
objects
which
he
stood
upon
the
table
in
a
row
they
were
eight
of
a
very
ordinary
kind
much
like
those
already
seen
in
the
booth
outside
the
sand
in
each
one
was
wholly
in
the
upper
glass
and
was
just
beginning
to
trickle
down
into
the
lower
the
strangers
were
obviously
disappointed
i
fear
your
displeasure
said
shiraz
but
apart
from
my
trifling
rugs
these
are
all
i
have
to
offer
and
what
said
the
sly
old
fox
what
may
be
the
price
of
these
interesting
objects
the
price
said
shiraz
fixing
his
beady
eyes
on
aunt
amanda
the
price
is
this
and
nothing
less
your
treasure
on
the
mules
outside
your
share
of
the
treasure
on
the
mules
everyone
gasped
the
treasure
which
they
had
gone
through
so
many
perils
to
secure
for
these
indifferent
trinkets
a
life
of
ease
and
plenty
for
an
ahem
said
the
old
codger
with
the
wooden
leg
excuse
me
for
saying
it
but
the
er
price
appears
to
be
a
little
bit
high
it
is
too
high
for
me
said
the
sly
old
fox
positively
i
regret
to
say
it
but
i
am
compelled
to
withdraw
i
can
not
go
on
at
such
a
figure
please
consider
me
out
of
it
and
er
me
too
said
the
old
codger
with
the
wooden
leg
well
said
toby
doubtfully
it
a
blamed
hard
thing
to
give
up
all
that
treasure
for
one
of
these
here
little
toys
i
do
see
my
way
clear
to
doing
it
what
do
you
say
aunt
amanda

do
it
said
aunt
amanda
looking
at
shiraz
whose
eyes
were
still
on
her
i
come
all
this
way
to
do
it
and
i
do
it
i
ai

to

at
the
last
minute
my
mind

freddie
hi

said
punch
after
due
consideration
said
the
churchwarden
i
think
i
will
buy
one
also
hanlon
nodded
a
vigorous
assent
the
two
old
codgers
however
were
firm
in
their
refusal
they
could
not
be
persuaded
they
retired
from
the
enterprise
then
and
there
under
the
conduct
of
the
young
man
the
two
old
codgers
left
the
room
and
returned
to
the
committee
who
were
waiting
with
the
mules
outside
and
with
them
went
toby
and
punch
and
hanlon
to
bring
back
that
portion
of
the
treasure
which
was
to
pay
for
the
six
this
was
a
work
of
much
difficulty
and
occupied
a
great
deal
of
time
while
it
was
going
on
the
having
first
asked
permission
reclined
again
on
the
divan
and
resumed
his
pipe
while
aunt
amanda
freddie
and
the
churchwarden
seated
themselves
at
his
invitation
and
watched
him
in
silence
the
treasure
was
at
length
piled
complete
in
a
corner
of
the
room
toby
punch
and
hanlon
returned
for
the
last
time
and
without
the
of
the
the
others
will
wait
outside
for
an
hour
said
toby
if
we
do
come
back
by
that
time
they
go
on
into
the
city
without
us
shiraz
the
laid
down
the
stem
of
his
pipe
and
rising
bowed
to
aunt
amanda
with
great
deference
permit
me
most
gracious
lady
said
he
to
see
the
fingers
of
your
left
hand
he
took
in
his
own
right
hand
the
third
finger
of
aunt
amanda
left
and
bent
his
eyes
close
over
it
he
straightened
himself
up
with
a
long
breath
and
crossing
his
arms
upon
his
breast
made
a
low
salaam
it
is
as
i
thought
said
he
the
mark
is
here
on
the
third
finger
of
the
left
hand
highness
said
he
bowing
lower
i
pray
you
accept
your
servant
salutation
on
your
return
and
raising
her
hand
to
his
lips
he
kissed
it
in
a
very
courtly
manner
goodness
alive
said
aunt
amanda
turning
as
red
as
a
rose
you
make
me
feel
too
foolish
for
anything
you
have
been
away
a
long
time
said
shiraz
but
you
have
returned
happy
am
i
to
be
the
first
to
greet
you
on
your
return
you
and
the
others
have
all
been
enchanted
you
are
six
enchanted
souls
and
in
your
present
shapes
not
one
of
you
is
himself
i
suppose
you
do
not
know
that
you
are
enchanted
you
think
that
you
are
yourselves
is
it
not
so
i
assure
you
it
is
a
mistake
but
i
can
put
you
in
the
way
of
correcting
your
errors
and
restoring
yourselves
to
your
true
shapes
if
you
desire
it
madam
said
he
bowing
again
to
aunt
amanda
i
await
your
commands
i
reckon
we
all
want
to
be
corrected
said
aunt
amanda
it
what
we
come
here
for
we
come
a
long
way
to
this
island
and
for
nothing
on
earth
but
to
be
corrected
if
there
any
way
to
do
it
if
you
can
do
it
go
ahead
hearing
is
obedience
said
shiraz
please
to
take
the
each
one
took
up
an
from
the
table
and
held
it
in
his
hand
it
is
necessary
said
shiraz
to
destroy
the
sands
in
the
glasses
if
they
can
be
destroyed
the
enchantment
will
be
over
there
is
no
power
on
earth
which
can
destroy
the
sands
but
one
and
that
is
the
white
fire
of
the
preserver
will
you
risk
the
fire
i
will
said
aunt
amanda
now
somewhat
pale
and
the
others
nodded
assent
then
i
will
give
you
the
white
robes
said
shiraz
without
them
you
can
not
withstand
the
fire
he
went
to
a
wall
and
drew
from
behind
the
hangings
a
box
which
he
opened
on
the
table
from
this
box
he
took
six
white
linen
gowns
and
at
his
direction
each
put
on
one
of
the
gowns
freddie
was
much
too
long
and
he
was
obliged
to
hold
it
up
well
said
toby
i
always
did
look
ridiculous
in
a
but
this
beats
peace
said
shiraz
the
fire
will
not
harm
you
now
two
things
only
are
necessary
to
fear
nothing
and
to
hold
tight
to
the
with
these
words
he
clapped
his
hands
and
from
behind
the
hangings
on
the
rear
wall
stepped
a
black
man
clad
in
a
robe
similar
to
the
others
to
this
man
the
persian
spoke
in
some
strange
tongue
and
the
man
bowed
now
said
shiraz
you
will
follow
my
servant
farewell
and
peace
be
with
you
chapter
xxiii
from
the
fire
back
to
the
frying
pan
the
figures
having
left
the
room
by
a
small
circular
door
behind
the
hangings
followed
the
black
servant
along
a
passage
and
in
a
few
moments
came
to
a
bridge
similar
to
the
one
they
had
crossed
before
as
they
felt
their
way
over
it
cautiously
one
by
one
the
sound
of
rushing
water
came
to
them
from
below
and
a
cold
breeze
fanned
their
cheeks
a
little
further
on
they
touched
the
first
step
of
a
stair
and
began
to
ascend
its
worn
stone
treads
they
mounted
some
thirty
steps
and
touching
the
wall
with
their
hands
moved
onward
along
a
passage
this
passage
made
an
abrupt
turn
to
the
left
and
when
they
had
cleared
the
corner
they
saw
in
its
sides
before
them
a
gleam
of
light
here
and
there
the
master
said
the
black
servant
please
to
follow
they
passed
now
and
then
beneath
a
lighted
window
too
high
to
be
seen
through
and
at
the
end
of
the
passage
the
servant
paused
before
a
closed
iron
door
he
opened
this
door
with
a
key
and
led
them
forth
before
them
was
a
garden
the
most
beautiful
that
any
of
them
had
ever
seen
high
over
it
was
a
dome
of
pale
green
and
amber
glass
through
which
the
sunlight
streamed
in
mild
and
rays
the
walls
which
supported
the
dome
were
so
high
that
it
was
impossible
to
see
beyond
in
the
center
was
a
fountain
dropping
in
a
sparkling
shower
into
a
marble
basin
around
it
spread
a
carpet
of
flowers
of
all
the
colours
as
it
seemed
of
the
rainbow
along
the
walls
were
cocoa
palms
banana
trees
and
the
feathery
bamboo
white
cockatoos
sailed
across
from
palm
to
palm
the
air
was
heavy
with
a
warm
odour
of
moist
earth
and
blossoms
the
whole
party
drew
a
deep
breath
of
pleasure
the
dark
place
from
which
they
had
come
seemed
to
fade
away
like
a
dream
before
the
soft
beauty
of
the
garden
the
servant
led
them
to
the
opposite
side
and
unlocked
a
door
in
the
wall
making
way
for
them
to
pass
in
before
him
they
entered
and
heard
the
door
locked
behind
them
the
servant
was
no
longer
with
them
they
were
alone
in
a
small
square
room
of
stone
walls
and
an
earthen
floor
there
was
no
opening
but
in
the
opposite
wall
was
a
closed
door
a
pale
light
pervaded
the
place
from
what
source
they
could
not
discover
in
the
earthen
floor
from
wall
to
wall
grew
a
thicket
of
stiff
stalks
higher
than
freddie
head
and
clustered
closely
around
each
stalk
from
bottom
to
top
were
flowers
of
a
waxen
whiteness
it
seems
a
real
pity
said
aunt
amanda
to
break
those
pretty
plants
but
i
reckon
we
got
to
wade
into
them
i
mighty
curious
to
see
what
on
the
other
side
of
that
door
probably
the
fire
the
old
man
was
talking
about
oh
dear
i
do
like
fire
but
we
got
to
get
to
that
door
so
come
along
the
whole
party
moved
in
a
body
into
the
thicket
of
waxen
stalks
as
they
stepped
in
the
stalks
broke
around
them
with
sharp
reports
they
moved
on
again
and
the
reports
as
the
stalks
broke
became
louder
and
louder
and
now
each
one
felt
the
in
his
hand
being
tugged
at
and
found
that
wherever
his
hand
touched
a
flower
the
petals
flattened
themselves
on
the
hand
and
the
glass
and
clung
so
tight
that
it
took
a
hard
jerk
to
get
them
loose
there
was
danger
of
losing
the
glasses
and
with
one
accord
they
held
the
glasses
high
above
their
heads
the
moment
they
did
so
the
conduct
of
the
stalks
became
terrifying
indeed
as
if
in
anger
the
broken
stalks
spouted
forth
with
a
hiss
and
a
rush
blinding
jets
of
liquid
white
fire
which
tore
at
the
ceiling
angrily
and
roared
and
crackled
from
the
broken
stalks
it
spread
to
the
others
and
in
a
moment
jets
of
liquid
white
fire
were
blazing
and
crackling
upward
from
all
the
stalks
in
the
room
and
the
terrified
captives
were
in
the
very
midst
of
it
it
ran
up
their
robes
and
showered
on
them
from
the
ceiling
it
became
denser
and
angrier
it
was
all
but
unbearable
though
they
felt
it
in
only
a
tiny
fraction
of
its
real
strength
in
another
instant
the
frail
white
gowns
must
surely
be
consumed
but
in
some
strange
way
the
gowns
shed
off
the
liquid
fire
and
remained
unscorched
for
a
moment
the
sufferers
were
stupefied
they
were
unable
to
move
freddie
tried
to
scream
but
he
could
make
no
sound
he
almost
fainted
away
but
he
felt
through
it
all
the
sturdy
arm
of
toby
tight
about
him
they
pushed
on
in
a
close
body
and
passed
the
center
of
the
room
the
white
glare
became
more
blinding
the
roar
and
crackle
more
deafening
they
were
surrounded
cut
off
in
the
midst
of
destruction
they
were
bewildered
they
stopped
again
there
was
no
use
in
going
back
they
must
get
forward
through
the
furnace
at
any
cost
they
made
a
new
start
and
in
a
frenzy
of
terror
their
hands
before
their
eyes
with
a
rush
they
gained
the
door
they
crowded
against
it
they
pushed
and
beat
upon
it
it
gave
way
before
them
they
rushed
through
and
it
closed
behind
them
of
its
own
accord
they
were
standing
in
broad
daylight
on
the
sidewalk
of
a
city
street
under
a
high
blank
wall
with
shops
on
the
opposite
side
each
with
an
empty
of
sand
in
his
right
hand
and
each
clad
only
in
a
long
white
chapter
xxiv
disenchantment
complete
they
looked
behind
them
a
high
stone
wall
rose
at
their
backs
and
in
it
was
no
sign
of
a
door
they
looked
across
the
street
it
was
a
narrow
street
paved
with
on
the
opposite
side
where
a
row
of
little
low
shops
stretched
away
on
either
hand
a
few
people
were
going
in
and
out
at
the
doors
and
a
few
others
were
walking
at
some
distance
before
the
an
was
coming
slowly
down
the
street
freddie
had
sometimes
dreamed
of
being
out
among
people
in
broad
daylight
in
his
and
he
now
felt
the
same
terror
he
had
felt
in
those
dreams
he
looked
anxiously
at
the
shops
for
a
place
in
which
to
hide
no
one
appeared
to
observe
them
yet
but
they
would
soon
be
seen
and
it
would
be
dreadful
unless
they
could
find
shelter
without
a
moment
delay
we
had
better
run
into
one
of
those
shops
said
he
breathlessly
and
ask
them
to
hide
us
until
we
can
get
some
clothes
ah
no
said
a
soft
voice
beside
him
at
his
right
it
is
not
a
shop
that
i
must
go
to
now
i
must
hurry
home
freddie
looked
around
at
his
right
for
aunt
amanda
there
was
no
aunt
amanda
in
her
place
holding
an
empty
in
her
right
hand
was
a
lady
the
fairest
whom
freddie
had
ever
seen
she
was
young
her
eyes
were
of
the
blue
of
summer
skies
her
hair
was
golden
yellow
on
her
soft
white
cheek
was
a
tinge
of
pink
two
heavy
braids
of
hair
hung
almost
to
her
knees
her
eyes
were
sparkling
with
happiness
and
a
tender
and
wistful
smile
curved
her
lips
as
freddie
gazed
at
her
he
thought
that
there
could
not
be
in
the
world
another
so
radiantly
beautiful
she
looked
about
her
as
one
who
sees
familiar
things
after
a
long
absence
freddie
eyes
fell
to
the
hand
which
was
nearest
him
her
left
on
the
third
finger
of
her
left
hand
was
a
ruby
ring
are
you
he
faltered
are
you
aunt
amanda
i
think
she
said
smiling
on
him
i
think
i
was
once
i
think
i
can
remember
that
name
and
you
are
let
me
see
what
was
your
name
ah
yes
your
name
was
freddie
but
we
must
hurry
we
must
not
keep
them
waiting
freddie
turned
and
saw
beside
him
four
strange
men
all
gazing
at
the
beautiful
lady
in
amazement
in
the
right
hand
of
each
was
an
empty
freddie
looked
down
on
the
two
men
who
stood
nearest
him
he
looked
on
them
he
was
suddenly
aware
that
he
was
not
looking
up
they
were
short
for
men
and
of
precisely
the
same
height
their
faces
were
square
their
prominent
and
their
noses
hooked
the
head
of
one
was
bald
and
the
hair
of
the
other
head
lay
flat
down
on
his
forehead
where
it
curved
back
like
a
hairpin
except
for
their
heads
they
were
in
all
respects
twins
there
was
no
hump
on
the
back
of
either
of
them
punch
and
mr
toby
said
freddie
the
wery
same
said
the
one
that
me
said
the
other
behind
toby
stood
a
lean
man
in
spectacles
his
hung
upon
him
very
loosely
and
he
was
very
spare
indeed
his
cheeks
were
somewhat
hollow
his
eyes
behind
his
glasses
were
deep
and
solemn
his
frame
was
the
frame
of
one
who
subdues
the
flesh
by
fasting
hair
curling
inward
at
the
back
of
his
neck
made
a
kind
of
aureole
around
his
thin
face
he
looked
for
all
the
world
as
he
stood
barefoot
in
his
long
white
gown
like
one
of
those
saints
you
see
in
painted
glass
windows
in
a
church
is
it
said
freddie
hesitating
is
it
the
churchwarden
i
have
reason
to
believe
said
the
saintly
looking
man
that
i
have
been
known
by
that
name
but
i
am
in
reality
and
always
have
been
in
reality
something
far
more
lowly
than
a
churchwarden
i
am
and
always
have
been
at
heart
a
meek
and
humble
follower
of
the
holy
thomas
à
kempis
whose
life
of
serene
and
cloistered
sanctity
i
have
always
wished
to
imitate
now
that
i
am
myself
it
is
my
ambition
to
be
known
if
it
is
not
too
presumptuous
to
say
so
as
thomas
the
inferior
pax
vobiscum
i
ai
got
the
least
idea
what
that
means
said
toby
but
anyway
it
the
churchwarden
voice
whether
he
calls
himself
thomas
the
inferior
or
daniel
the
deleterious
you
heartily
welcome
warden
and
i
hope
you
wo
mind
my
saying
that
a
good
meal
would
do
you
any
harm
from
the
looks
of
you
i
pretty
near
starved
to
death
myself
punch

a
tiny
silken
mustache

and
taller
than
any

except

exclaimed
punch

word
freddie
looked
down
at
punch
and
realized
his
own
height
he
looked
at
his
hands
and
they
were
almost
as
large
as
hanlon
his
came
to
his
ankles
and
he
realized
that

fell
silent
the
young
and
lovely
lady
who
had
said
nothing
during
their
talk
was
smiling
from
one
to
another
she
seemed
to
feel
no
embarrassment
nor
concern
nor
anything
indeed
but
happiness
she
looked
at
toby
with
a
smile
and
all
the
men
looked
at
her

he
that
a

the
way
she
would
have
looked

i

the

said
the
tall
young
knight
who
used
to
be
freddie
but

are
beginning
to
be
noticed
i
have
seen
one
or
two
people
stare
from
the
shop
windows

had
better

to
one
of
those
shops
and
seek
refuge
until
we
can
find
proper
clothes
ah

said
the
lady
with
a
radiant
smile
i
must
hasten
home
they
have
been
waiting
a
long
time
and
i
must
not
lose
a
moment
i

street
is
changed
since
i
was
here
but
i
know
it
i
know
the
way
come
with
me
i
am
going
home
she
placed
her
empty
in
freddie
hand
and
led
the
way
up
the
street
her
bare
feet
trod
the
pavement
swiftly
she
walked
as
if
she
had
never
known
what
it
was
to
be
lame
she
went
swimmingly
with
a
motion
of
infinite
grace
the
others
looked
about
them
uneasily
as
they
followed
but
she
seemed
to
care
nothing
for
the
eyes
of
the
people
the
stopped
as
it
came
to
them
and
the
driver
who
was
walking
beside
it
stopped
also
and
gazed
at
them
with
his
mouth
open
faces
appeared
at
as
they
went
by
and
figures
appeared
at
two
or
three
passed
them
and
after
they
had
gone
went
to
the
nearest
and
stood
there
for
a
moment
in
talk
with
the
they
then
began
to
follow
the
strange
group
up
the
street
in
a
few
moments
others
joined
them
freddie
looked
behind
and
wished
to
run
but
the
lady
who
was
leading
paid
no
attention
a
little
further
on
she
turned
a
corner
and
the
party
found
themselves
in
a
much
busier
street
the
sidewalks
were
alive
with
people
in
a
moment
there
was
a
great
silence
when
the
six
figures
first
appeared
some
of
the
people
began
to
laugh
then
they
looked
at
the
face
of
the
lady
who
swept
along
in
advance
of
her
attendants
and
they
laughed
no
more
they
began
to
whisper
one
to
another
they
fell
apart
and
made
way
for
her
and
her
attendants
they
stopped
they
forgot
their
own
affairs
some
ran
into
the
shops
and
called
out
the
persons
who
were
within
they
gaped
and
whispered
and
nodded
and
held
up
their
hands
and
with
one
accord
began
to
follow
further
on
heads
appeared
from
the
windows
of
and
doors
opened
all
who
could
walk
joined
themselves
to
the
crowd
which
was
following
the
wondrous
lady
and
her
five
strange
companions
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
city
on
past
the
region
of
shops
into
the
region
of
gardens
and
mansions
up
by
a
gradual
ascent
to
the
place
of
the
largest
and
tallest
towers
and
domes
on
they
went
the
six
and
figures
before
and
the
crowd
behind
and
the
further
they
went
the
greater
became
the
crowd
and
still
there
was
no
sound
from
the
people
except
the
sound
of
an
awestruck
whispering
the
dark
cloud
on
the
was
now
plainly
in
view
before
them
between
the
towers
and
domes
and
they
could
see
the
great
mass
of
the
king
tower
where
it
rose
to
the
cloud
and
lost
itself
within
it
at
the
end
of
the
street
which
they
were
now
following
a
majestic
gateway
could
be
seen
and
beyond
it
a
park
behind
them
the
street
was
choked
from
wall
to
wall
with
a
vast
multitude
from
every
house
as
the
multitude
passed
its
people
poured
forth
and
joined
the
throng
business
was
forgotten
shops
and
houses
were
deserted
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
city
was
in
the
street
following
the
lady
and
her
five
attendants
she
looked
not
behind
her
once
she
seemed
to
be
unaware
of
anything
in
the
world
about
her
her
eyes
shone
like
stars
she
had
forgotten
even
her
companions
she
spoke
not
a
word
but
looked
forward
to
the
stately
gateway
and
the
park
beyond
still
no
sound
came
from
the
multitude
except
a
sound
of
whispering
they
reached
the
gateway
on
each
side
was
a
great
stone
pillar
supporting
a
gate
of
massive
bronze
the
gates
were
open
without
an
instant
hesitation
she
led
the
way
within
and
as
she
did
so
placed
her
left
hand
on
her
heart
the
throng
seemed
to
waver
a
moment
and
then
as
the
six
barefoot
and
figures
moved
swiftly
up
the
driveway
into
the
park
it
flowed
in
silently
between
the
gates
and
followed
at
a
respectful
distance
before
them
at
a
distance
on
a
knoll
from
which
terraces
of
velvet
grass
descended
stood
the
palace
of
the
king
white
and
broad
and
passing
a
grove
of
trees
the
lady
left
the
roadway
and
stepped
into
the
smooth
grass
of
a
lawn
and
sped
across
it
directly
towards
the
terraces
before
the
palace
of
the
king
she
mounted
the
gentle
slope
her
five
friends
following
her
and
the
vast
throng
filling
the
park
to
the
gates
came
on
behind
she
reached
the
first
terrace
her
hand
was
still
on
her
heart
a
dog
barked
windows
in
the
palace
front
began
to
go
up
and
faces
to
appear
from
an
archway
sprang
a
pack
of
beautiful
tall
white
dogs
and
rushed
on
the
lady
barking
freddie
made
as
if
to
protect
her
but
she
waved
him
back
with
a
smile
the
dogs
sprang
up
as
if
to
devour
her
but
they
did
no
harm
they
barked
as
if
their
throats
would
burst
they
leaped
and
gambolled
about
her
they
thrust
their
noses
into
her
hand
they
almost
spoke
and
in
the
midst
of
it
there
appeared
upon
the
wide
steps
before
the
palace
door
a
man
and
beside
him
three
children
at
sight
of
this
man
and
the
children
the
lady
covered
her
eyes
for
an
instant
with
her
hands
and
gave
a
sob
but
she
quickly
looked
up
and
sped
on
more
swiftly
than
before
her
hands
hanging
beside
her
and
a
bright
misty
look
in
her
eyes
the
man
upon
the
palace
steps
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hands
and
gazed
upon
her
and
the
multitude
spread
out
across
the
park
behind
her
one
of
the
children
a
tiny
boy
he
took
by
the
hand
and
another
a
girl
a
little
older
he
grasped
with
his
other
hand
and
with
the
third
a
boy
of
something
over
nine
beside
them
they
all
four
came
down
the
steps
and
crossed
the
terrace
to
meet
the
radiant
lady
on
the
next
terrace
they
met
he
dropped
his
children
hands
and
stopped
he
was
a
man
of
some
thirty
years
richly
clad
and
handsome
beyond
measure
as
he
stopped
the
multitude
found
its
voice
a
mighty
shout
went
up
long
live
the
king
long
live
the
king
he
paid
no
attention
his
eyes
were
on
the
fair
lady
before
him
a
cry
from
the
oldest
boy
rang
out
clear
and
sharp
in
the
silence
mother
the
king
held
out
his
arms
my
darling
he
cried
at
last
at
last
beloved
she
cried
and
rushed
into
his
arms
and
buried
her
face
in
his
shoulder
the
children
clung
to
her
weeping
and
with
one
arm
she
pressed
them
close
against
her
side
the
multitude
found
its
voice
again

chapter
xxv
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
there
an
old
man
said
robert
to
freddie
he
lives
on
the
mountain
i
saw
him
once
they
were
sitting
on
the
palace
lawn
looking
up
at
the
mountain
which
rose
behind
the
king
tower
the
sun
was
directly
overhead
and
was
accordingly
hidden
by
the
cloud
the
lower
slopes
of
the
mountain
were
easy
and
gradual
but
they
grew
steeper
as
they
ascended
and
at
the
point
where
the
mountain
entered
the
cloud
it
was
a
straight
and
smooth
wall
of
granite
plainly
impossible
to
climb
the
king
eldest
child
fixed
his
big
eyes
on
the
tall
young
man
beside
him
i
like
you
said
he
i
wish
you
would
take
me
up
the
mountain
some
time
for
blackberries
will
you
if
the
queen
permits
said
freddie
we
will
go
tomorrow
a
long
time
had
passed
since
the
queen
return
a
happy
time
during
which
the
five
who
had
come
with
the
queen
were
made
to
feel
as
if
they
had
lived
all
their
lives
in
a
palace
the
two
old
codgers
were
found
by
toby
comfortably
established
in
a
double
shop
of
their
own
on
one
side
of
which
the
old
codger
with
the
wooden
leg
sold
tobacco
and
on
the
other
side
of
which
the
sly
old
fox
sold
jewelry
each
of
them
entirely
contented
with
his
fortune
and
settled
down
for
life
the
third
had
paid
his
respects
at
the
palace
and
was
unable
to
talk
of
anything
but
his
museum
for
which
he
was
devising
many
plans
including
a
method
whereby
the
late
matthew
speak
might
be
assured
against
ever
being
blown
out
of
the
window
the
saintly
person
who
had
once
been
the
churchwarden
was
occupied
nowadays
in
a
little
room
in
the
basement
of
the
palace
in
copying
in
beautiful
letters
an
ancient
book
belonging
to
the
king
punch
and
toby
spent
their
time
in
exploring
the
city
arm
in
arm
very
inquisitive
very
talkative
and
making
friends
with
everybody
hanlon
work
in
life
was
it
appeared
the
climbing
of
the
tower
every
day
he
disappeared
within
and
every
day
he
declared
that
he
would
mount
to
the
top
before
he
finished
but
he
had
not
yet
got
to
the
top
and
there
did
not
seem
much
prospect
of
his
ever
doing
so
as
for
freddie
not
that
he
was
called
freddie
now
the
king
had
given
him
a
name
the
chevalier
frederick
and
by
that
name
he
was
spoken
of
by
everybody
except
that
toby
sometimes
forgot
and
called
him
the
chandelier
as
for
the
chevalier
frederick
his
interest
was
mainly
in
the
queen
three
children
robert
genevieve
and
james
and
at
the
present
moment
the
oldest
robert
was
sitting
with
the
chevalier
on
the
palace
lawn
gossiping
we
will
go
tomorrow
the
chevalier
was
saying
and
then
the
little
boy
robert
went
on
about
the
old
man
he
had
seen
on
the
mountain
i
saw
him
once
said
robert
just
before

i
was

mother
she
was
terribly
worried
he
stopped
to
think
it
over
and
then
went
on
again
there
was
any
tower
then
it
was
just
before
the
old
chap
came
and
built
the
tower
in
a
night

i
did
mother

jenny
i
never
call
her
genevieve
because
jenny

and
jenny
would

because
she
was
afraid
and
james
was
too
little
so
i
went
all
by
myself
and
it
was
getting
pretty
dark
and
i
was
starting
home
down
the
mountain
because
i
knew
mother
would
be
worried
and
i
saw
the
old
man
coming
down
the
mountain
and
he
did
see
me
and
he
had
a
pack
on
his
back
and
a
long
stick
in
his
hand
and
a
gown
belted
in
about
the
middle
and
he
was
kind
of
fat
and
and
he
did
see
me
but
i
saw
him
and
pretty
soon
he
went
down
into
a
gully
and
i
did
see
him
any
more
and
i
came
on
home
because
it
was
getting

said
freddie
if

this
moment
hanlon
appeared
somewhat
out
of
breath
and
he
and
freddie
went
into
the
palace
together
he
was
quite
jubilant

the
next
morning
queen
miranda
having
given
her
consent
freddie
and
robert
left
the
palace
for
their
day
on
the
mountain
all
day
they
wandered
up
the
trails
and
in
the
afternoon
when
their
luncheon
was
all
gone
and
they
were
tired
they
began
to
descend
it
was
growing
dark
they
had
had
a
glorious
day
and
they
were
sorry
it
would
soon
be
over
they
stretched
themselves
on
the
ground
beneath
a
mountain
oak
and
looked
below
them
past
the
tower
across
the
roof
of
the
palace
to
the
city
there
was
no
living
thing
in
sight
except
a
bird
which
sailed
across
their
view
and
disappeared
well
robert
said
freddie
i
suppose
the
old
man
who
used
to
be
here
is
gone
come
we
must
go
your
mother
will
be
worried
they
got
to
their
feet
as
they
did
so
a
kind
of
groan
startled
them
they
listened
it
came
again
from
some
point
near
by
freddie
thought
he
could
make
out
a
weak
human
voice
trying
to
call
for
help
drawing
robert
after
him
he
climbed
over
a
number
of
boulders
and
mounted
to
the
top
of
a
rise
in
the
ground
and
looked
down
into
a
deep
gully
covered
on
its
sides
with
rocks
and
bushes
what
he
saw
there
gave
him
a
start
of
alarm
at
the
bottom
was
an
old
man
lying
on
his
back
with
one
leg
doubled
under
him
his
face
up
to
the
sky
from
his
lips
came
a
groan
followed
by
a
faint
cry
for
help
his
head
was
bald
he
was
rather
stout
he
wore
a
long
white
beard
and
he
was
clad
in
a
short
dark
gown
belted
about
the
middle
his
legs
were
bare
and
on
the
foot
which
was
visible
he
wore
a
sandal
robert
looked
over
freddie
shoulder
and
whispered
in
his
ear
that
him
he
fallen
down
and
hurt
himself
it
was
true
the
old
man
had
evidently
fallen
and
he
was
plainly
suffering
freddie
clambered
down
to
him
and
knelt
beside
him
the
old
man
looked
into
the
young
man
eyes
and
said
in
a
feeble
whisper
my
leg
broken
help
me
home
freddie
assisted
him
into
a
sitting
position
and
then
lifted
him
up
and
held
him
i
can
not
walk
said
the
old
man
unless
you
can
carry
me
i
must
die
here
freddie
was
properly
proud
of
his
new
strength
and
he
believed
that
he
could
carry
the
old
man
where
do
you
live
said
he
up
the
mountain
i
will
show
you
i
beg
you
to
carry
me
home
i
will
do
my
best
said
freddie
he
turned
his
back
to
the
old
man
and
supporting
him
at
the
same
time
put
the
old
man
arms
about
his
neck
and
by
a
great
effort
got
the
poor
creature
on
his
back
carrying
him
thus
he
began
to
go
haltingly
up
the
side
of
the
gully
the
little
boy
watched
them
wonderingly
it
was
a
terrible
journey
the
old
man
directed
freddie
from
moment
to
moment
and
the
way
led
steadily
up
the
mountain
by
a
course
which
freddie
had
not
seen
that
day
the
burden
on
freddie
back
became
heavier
and
heavier
he
panted
harder
and
harder
under
it
he
stumbled
from
time
to
time
and
every
instant
told
himself
that
he
could
go
no
further
the
old
man
seemed
to
think
of
nothing
but
of
getting
home
the
little
boy
followed
staring
with
big
eyes
freddie
had
gone
but
a
short
way
up
the
when
he
felt
through
all
his
back
where
it
touched
the
old
man
a
chill
his
shoulders
and
throat
where
the
arms
of
the
old
man
touched
them
became
cold
as
he
struggled
on
the
chill
increased
he
felt
as
if
he
were
hugging
to
his
back
a
burden
of
ice
are
we
nearly
there
he
asked
trying
to
wipe
a
cold
perspiration
from
his
forehead
no
no
said
the
old
man
go
on
a
long
way
yet
you
ca
be
tired
so
soon
the
cold
upon
freddie
back
and
shoulders
and
throat
became
a
dead
numbness
he
was
too
cold
to
shiver
his
arms
too
were
now
becoming
numb
and
he
felt
that
he
could
hold
his
burden
no
longer
he
stopped
i
must
put
you
down
he
said
i
must
rest
a
moment
i
do
know
what
makes
me
so
cold
no
no
said
the
old
man
too
soon
too
soon
keep
on
i
can
not
said
freddie
i
am
freezing
my
strength
is
gone
i
must
rest
with
these
words
he
let
the
old
man
carefully
down
and
laid
him
on
the
ground
he
stood
there
panting
and
rubbing
his
frozen
hands
together
stupid
weakling
said
the
old
man
staring
up
at
him
go
and
search
upon
the
and
bring
me
hither
seeds
of
the
fennel
which
you
will
there
find
and
be
quick
for
i
perish
freddie
and
the
little
boy
hastened
away
together
and
at
a
distance
on
the
found
after
a
long
search
a
few
plants
of
the
fennel
with
which
they
hurried
back
to
the
old
man
he
was
gone
they
looked
far
and
near
they
examined
every
nook
and
cranny
the
mountain
was
steep
at
this
point
and
difficult
for
any
sound
man
for
an
old
man
crippled
it
seemed
impossible
but
he
was
nowhere
to
be
found
he
was
gone
freddie
and
robert
turned
homeward
and
made
hard
work
of
it
the
little
boy
became
extremely
heated
with
his
labor
but
freddie
remained
as
cold
as
ever
it
is
true
that
he
perspired
but
the
beads
upon
his
forehead
were
like
the
beads
upon
glass
his
hands
were
so
numb
that
when
he
cut
them
slightly
on
a
rock
he
felt
no
pain
his
back
where
the
old
man
had
clung
to
it
with
his
body
was
coldest
of
all
he
was
so
stiff
that
he
could
scarcely
bend
his
arms
or
body
many
times
the
little
boy
had
to
help
him
down
the
chill
spread
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
his
legs
were
nearly
as
cold
as
his
arms
when
they
passed
the
tower
his
knees
were
as
if
frozen
and
would
not
bend
the
little
boy
put
his
arm
about
him
and
tried
to
help
him
walk
he
began
to
lose
knowledge
of
his
whereabouts
he
held
out
a
stiff
arm
before
him
like
a
blind
man
and
dragged
one
foot
after
the
other
like
a
man
whose
legs
are
made
of
stone
the
little
boy
weeping
to
himself
took
his
icy
outstretched
hand
and
led
him
home
the
palace
door
was
thrown
open
the
little
boy
rushed
in
with
a
cry
and
turned
around
to
his
companion
the
rigid
creature
which
was
freddie
stood
in
the
doorway
staring
vacantly
and
fell
slowly
forward
on
its
face
upon
the
floor
chapter
xxvi
the
king
tower
freddie
was
very
ill
he
was
so
ill
that
after
a
week
the
king
gave
up
all
hope
and
believed
he
would
die
the
queen
wept
bitterly
she
scarcely
left
his
side
at
night
she
did
not
sleep
for
weeping
and
by
day
she
sat
by
his
bed
and
watched
his
cold
white
face
his
friends
were
not
allowed
to
see
him
and
of
these
it
appeared
that
hanlon
had
been
gone
for
some
days
up
the
tower
all
that
the
best
doctors
in
the
city
could
do
had
been
done
but
the
chevalier
was
no
better
he
lay
under
the
blankets
cold
as
ice
and
motionless
as
stone
and
his
eyes
big
round
eyes
like
the
eyes
of
a
child
stared
up
strangely
out
of
deep
sockets
they
looked
up
at
the
king
who
was
bending
down
over
the
bed
and
smiling
encouragingly
the
queen
and
her
three
children
robert
genevieve
and
james
were
standing
close
by
but
they
could
not
smile
come
chevalier
said
the
king
you
will
be
well
soon
i
am
sure
a
faint
voice
came
from
the
pale
lips
not
the
voice
of
a
grown
man
but
the
voice
of
a
child
that
is
my
name
it
said
my
name
is
fweddie
the
king
went
away
and
took
his
children
with
him
and
after
they
had
gone
the
queen
heard
the
childish
voice
again
from
the
bed
i
want
to
see
aunt
amanda
the
queen
went
to
him
and
stood
beside
the
bed
he
looked
up
at
her
you
are
aunt
amanda
he
said
i
want
to
see
aunt
amanda
i
think
that
was
my
name
once
said
the
queen
will
you
talk
to
me
he
looked
at
her
again
and
she
saw
that
he
did
not
know
her
my
farver
sent
me
he
said
toby
has
gone
to
the
and
my
farver
he
wants
a
pound
of
mitchner
toby
is
here
in
the
palace
now
and
i
sure
he
i
do
know
about
any
palace
i
ca
wait
long
my
farver
told
me
to
hurry
the
queen
said
no
more
and
freddie
appeared
to
go
to
sleep
the
night
came
on
and
the
queen
still
sat
by
his
side
it
grew
very
late
her
children
had
long
since
gone
to
bed
and
even
the
king
was
asleep
in
his
own
apartments
the
palace
was
silent
and
there
was
scarcely
a
light
anywhere
in
the
great
place
except
the
light
of
a
taper
on
a
table
in
freddie
room
the
queen
was
bending
forward
watching
the
face
on
the
pillow
the
eyes
were
closed
the
lips
were
together
and
there
was
no
sign
of
breathing
she
knew
that
it
could
not
be
much
longer
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
wept
bitterly
a
gentle
tap
upon
the
door
aroused
her
she
rose
and
admitted
toby
and
punch
thomas
the
inferior
and
hanlon
quick
said
hanlon
there

a
minute
to
be
lost
if
you
plase
i
ask
ye
to
put
on
yer
bonnet
in
a
hurry
we
off
on
a
journey
and
the
poor
sick
young
lad
coming
along
with
us
if
you
just
be
in
a
hurry
with
the
bonnet
the
queen
scarcely
realizing
what
she
was
doing
left
the
room
and
went
first
to
the
nursery
where
she
bent
over
her
three
sleeping
children
and
kissed
them
each
and
murmured
a
loving
above
them
as
if
she
were
going
to
leave
them
and
for
a
long
long
time
she
gazed
at
each
rosy
face
as
if
to
fix
it
in
her
memory
forever
when
she
returned
to
the
room
wearing
a
shawl
over
her
head
and
shoulders
she
was
startled
to
see
that
the
sick
youth
was
sitting
upright
in
a
chair
thickly
wrapped
in
blankets
his
round
childlike
eyes
were
wide
open
and
to
her
surprise
a
faint
smile
seemed
to
hover
about
his
lips
she
looked
at
the
others
each
held
in
his
hand
an
empty
plase
to
get
your
said
hanlon
and
too
freddie
was
soon
found
in
a
drawer
in
the
same
room
the
queen
she
brought
in
a
moment
from
another
room
hanlon
picked
up
from
the
floor
where
he
had
previously
laid
it
a
small
canvas
bag
and
placed
it
on
the
table
under
the
candle
all
of
the
empty
he
placed
upon
the
table
and
unscrewed
the
part
of
each
by
which
it
was
designed
to
receive
its
load
of
sand
he
lifted
his
bag
and
out
of
it
poured
into
each
glass
a
quantity
of
fine
white
sand
a
little
more
or
less
wo
matter
a
mite
said
he
when
he
had
filled
them
all
a
foine
time
i
had
getting

sand

sure
but
it
the
true
article
straight
from
the
hand
of
the
old
crayture
himself
and
is
him
we
going
to
this
very
minute
and
the
young
lad
with
us
by
the
sand
in
the
we
get
back
to
the
old
crayture
in
the
time
it
took
me
to
find
him
without
it
and
by
the
same
we
get
him
to
save
for
us
the
poor
lad
life

michael
each
now
took
his
in
his
hand
they
were
the
same
they
had
bought
of
shiraz
the
persian
and
the
sand
which
was
now
in
them
was
the
same
sort
of
fine
white
sand
which
had
been
in
them
before
their
ordeal
in
the
fire
punch
and
toby
lifted
the
sick
youth
from
his
chair
and
carried
him
between
them
in
a
sitting
position
towards
the
door
hanlon
looked
at
him
anxiously
and
commanded
haste
in
a
moment
the
whole
party
were
in
the
hall
and
in
a
few
moments
more
they
were
crossing
the
lawn
towards
king
tower
it
was
a
clear
night
and
the
sky
was
spangled
with
stars
hanlon
opened
the
door
of
the
tower
and
when
they
were
all
within
closed
it
again
madam
and
gintlemen
said
he

gasped
the
queen
in
terror
i
must
not
go
to
the
top
of
this
tower
ah
she
stopped
suddenly
and
went
on
in
a
determined
voice

will
though
if
it
is
to
be
then
it
must
be
our
young
chevalier

here
for
me
and
i

go

strength

top
of

tower

madam
said
hanlon
for
the
old
crayture

sand

willing
to
help

to

and
the
sand

the
stairs
and

old
crayture

me

hands
and

what

hanlon
went
up
first
then
came
the
queen
and
after
her
punch
and
toby
bearing
between
them
in
an
upright
position
the
stiff
cold
form
of
the
young
chevalier
and
last
of
all
came
thomas
the
inferior
in
his
long
brown
gown
and
sandals
each
climbed
slowly
but
the
steps
appeared
to
flow
downward
under
their
feet
with
great
rapidity
they
were
not
conscious
of
selecting
any
particular
tread
to
step
on
but
while
a
foot
was
rising
from
one
step
to
the
next
it
seemed
as
if
a
thousand
steps
were
passing
downward
until
the
foot
came
down
and
found
itself
on
a
perfectly
motionless
tread
undoubtedly
they
were
mounting
without
unusual
exertion
a
thousand
steps
at
a
time
even
at
that
rate
of
progress
the
journey
upward
seemed
an
endless
one
they
paused
sometimes
to
go
into
one
of
the
rooms
on
a
landing
for
a
moment
rest
and
at
those
times
they
looked
out
of
a
window
it
was
not
long
before
they
were
so
high
that
on
looking
out
the
city
lights
were
no
more
than
a
glowing
blur
at
the
last
window
on
their
upward
progress
they
looked
up
at
the
cloud
it
was
immediately
above
their
heads
after
that
there
were
no
more
windows
they
went
on
upward
in
silence
aware
in
the
darkness
of
the
swift
flow
of
steps
downward
under
them
as
they
raised
their
feet
each
observed
that
as
he
raised
his
foot
the
sand
in
his
flowed
downward
a
thousand
times
more
rapidly
as
if
time
were
suddenly
running
faster
than
it
was
used
to
running
the
walls
of
the
tower
were
by
this
time
coming
closer
together
and
the
stair
was
even
steeper
than
before
they
were
panting
for
breath
and
punch
and
toby
seemed
to
be
all
but
exhausted
we
are
almost
at
the
top
said
hanlon
keep
on
do
give
up
it
was
now
because
there
were
no
more
rooms
nor
windows
completely
dark
the
face
of
the
sick
youth
could
not
be
seen
and
no
one
knew
whether
he
was
still
living
even
the
sand
in
their
they
were
now
unable
to
see
we
are
almost
there
said
hanlon
only
another
minute
or
two
is
easy
work
to
what
i
had
in
coming
up
alone
punch
gave
a
groan
hi
car
go
another
step
said
he
completely
at
this
moment
hanlon
stopped
upon
a
landing
it
had
been
a
long
while
since
there
had
been
a
landing
and
they
were
all
glad
to
rest
upon
it
they
crowded
about
hanlon
in
the
dark
the
door
is
over
there
said
he
keep
close
to
me
he
walked
a
few
feet
forward
across
the
level
floor
and
came
to
a
stop
again
is
the
top
of
the
tower
said
he
i
hope
we
not
too
late
to
save
the
young
lad
life
stand
close
behind
me
he
moved
forward
again
and
stopped
he
was
evidently
feeling
a
wall
with
his
hands
ah
said
he
is
the
door
itself
now
thin
we
see
he
knocked
upon
the
door
with
his
knuckles
there
was
no
response
he
knocked
again
there
was
a
sound
upon
the
other
side
of
the
door
as
of
the
rattling
of
a
chain
and
the
sliding
of
a
bolt
a
slit
of
light
appeared
up
and
down
in
the
dark
wall
it
became
wider
it
was
apparent
that
the
door
was
opening
and
in
another
moment
the
door
was
flung
wide
and
in
the
doorway
stood
an
old
man
holding
up
in
his
right
hand
a
lantern
in
which
glimmered
a
candle
chapter

the
sorcerer
den
he
was
an
old
man
rather
stout
dressed
in
a
short
gown
tied
in
with
a
cord
about
the
middle
and
wearing
sandals
on
his
feet
he
stooped
somewhat
a
white
beard
hung
to
his
waist
his
head
was
bald
except
for
a
forelock
of
white
hair
which
drooped
over
his
forehead
towards
his
eyes
there
was
a
humorous
twinkle
in
his
eye
and
a
smile
overspread
his
broad
round
face
is
the
old
parrty
who
will
cure
the
chivalier
said
hanlon
behind
his
hand
it
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
whispered
toby
it
the
magician
who
built
the
tower
whispered
queen
miranda
in
alarm
hit
me
own
father
as
ever
was
cried
punch
aloud
greetings
old
dear
a
surprise
what
did
you
come
hi
no
end
glad
to
see
you
and
the
larst
person
hi

thought
to

this
my
word
what

lark

the
old
gentleman
affably
and
your
friends
too
i
very
glad
to
see
you
my
boy
i
had
some
trouble
in
getting
you
here
but
here
you
are
at
last
thanks
to
my
good
friend
hanlon
and
you
are
now
well
out
of
the
hands
of
shiraz
put
the
little
boy
down
in
that
chair
and
we
see
what
we
can
do
for
him
to
speak
of
a
youth
with
a
mustache
as
a
little
boy
seemed
hardly
respectful
but
freddie
did
not
seem
to
mind
it
indeed
his
big
round
childlike
eyes
dwelt
fondly
on
the
old
man
and
there
was
something
like
a
smile
about
his
lips
he
was
seated
gently
in
a
chair
within
the
room
and
while
punch
father
set
down
his
lantern
on
a
table
the
others
looked
about
them
they
were
in
a
small
square
room
with
a
low
ceiling
by
the
dim
light
of
the
candle
they
could
see
that
it
was
bare
and
dusty
cobwebs
hung
in
all
the
corners
there
seemed
to
be
no
windows
but
set
upright
in
one
wall
was
what
looked
like
the
back
of
a
clock
as
tall
as
a
man
opposite
the
door
by
which
they
had
entered
was
another
door
around
the
walls
were
shelves
from
floor
to
ceiling
crowded
with
of
all
sizes
the
old
gentleman
observed
the
look
which
toby
cast
at
the
shelves
one
of
my
said
he
i
got
a
good
many
of
all
told
and
in
fact
you
find
a
of
mine
in
the
top
of
nearly
every
in
the
world
it
takes
a
deal
of
space
to
keep
all
the
in
i
can
tell
you
if
you
give
me
yours
i
put
away
for
you
shiraz

but
he
wo
do
it
again
he
manages
to
steal
one
now
and
then
when
i
away
but
i
usually
get
back
sooner
or
later
he
collected
the
from
his
visitors
and
put
them
away
on
a
shelf
look
parent
said
punch
hif
i
did
know
better
i
as
i
seen
this
room
before
there
the
back
of
the
clock
and
the
door
over
there
looks
like
you
a
sharp
eye
punch
my
boy
said
the
old
gentleman
quite
a
detective
you
are
my
son
now
then
we
better
get
busy
aunt
amanda
do
you
want
me
to
cast
off
your
enchantment
why
do
you
call
me
that
asked
queen
miranda
because
that
your
name
do
you
know
who
you
are
i
know
i
was
enchanted
once
under
the
name
of
aunt
amanda
no
no
you
enchanted
under
the
name
of
queen
miranda
but
shiraz
the
persian
told
us
he
would
disenchant
us
and
he
did
no
no
you
were
yourselves
before
and
you
are
enchanted
my
brain
is
in
a
whirl
said
queen
miranda
are
we
ourselves
now
or
were
we
ourselves
before
by
crackey
said
toby
it
too
much
for
me
and
i
give
it
up
anyway
what
we
want
to
know
is
can
you
cure
the
chevalier
i
can
and
i
will
said
the
old
man
there
nothing
the
matter
with
him
except
that
he
is
himself
as
soon
as
he
himself
again
be
well
he
was
given
the
chance
once
before
but
he
did
know
how
to
use
it
he
made
a
great
mistake
what
mistake
said
toby
he
made
the
mistake
of
carrying
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
on
his
back
if
he
had
only
lifted
him
up
in
his
arms
before
him
the
old
man
would
have
been
as
light
as
a
feather
and
freddie
would
have
been
himself
again
in
a
flash
but
of
course
he
did
know
we
got
to
correct
his
mistake
well
by
crickets
said
toby
this
is
correction
island
right
enough
blamed
if
i
know
which
is
the
mistake
and
which
is
the
correction
it
looks
to
me
as
if
it
was
a
mistake
to
be
corrected
and
we
got
to
correct
the
correction
back
again
something
like
that
said
the
old
man
smiling
i
going
to
undo
the
correction
of
each
one
of
you
and
then
you
all
be
yourselves
once
more
instead
of
these
false
things
you
now
are
queen
miranda
looked
at
the
ruby
ring
on
her
finger
and
wept
quietly
to
herself
as
for
freddie
his
eyes
never
left
the
face
of
the
old
man
the
old
man
stooped
over
freddie
and
laid
his
cheek
against
the
young
chevalier
pale
forehead
and
then
against
the
young
man
cheeks
he
then
threw
aside
the
blankets
and
sat
himself
down
on
freddie
knees
his
body
pressed
the
young
man
breast
and
his
cheek
touched
the
young
man
cheeks
one
after
the
other
it
was
some
moments
before
there
was
any
change
the
others
watched
anxiously
a
red
glow
began
to
appear
in
freddie
cheeks
and
his
eyes
became
brighter
he
raised
his
hands
he
moved
his
head
he
looked
about
him
he
smiled
into
the
face
of
the
old
man
you
are
better
said
the
old
man
i
very
well
said
freddie
in
a
clear
voice
but
i
think
i
must
have
been
sick
have
i
been
sick
rather
said
the
old
man
but
you
are
going
to
be
yourself
again
in
another
minute
now
then
put
your
arms
around
me
and
lift
me
off
can
you
do
that
easily
said
freddie
and
he
lifted
the
old
man
in
his
arms
and
rising
to
his
feet
at
the
same
time
tossed
the
old
man
off
with
an
easy
gesture
as
the
old
man
touched
the
floor
there
was
no
longer
any
chevalier
freddie
was
standing
before
the
chair
in
his
own
person
the
little
boy
once
more
with
sparkling
eyes
and
rosy
cheeks
he
looked
around
in
surprise
where
are
aunt
amanda
and
the
others
said
the
little
boy
wait
just
a
minute
freddie
said
the
old
man
now
madam
he
said
to
queen
miranda
if
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
lift
me
up
and
toss
me
away
queen
miranda
looked
at
him
doubtfully
he
was
a
person
and
it
seemed
absurd
to
think
of
lifting
him
but
she
did
as
he
directed
and
placing
her
hands
under
his
arms
she
found
that
he
weighed
no
more
than
a
baby
she
held
him
up
off
the
floor
now
cast
me
off
said
he
she
tossed
him
away
with
an
easy
gesture
and
he
alighted
on
his
feet
with
a
bound

freddie

stood
before
toby
and
directed
him
what
to

toby
seized
him
in
his
strong
hands
and
lifted
him
up
over
his
head
like
a
feather
pillow
and
such
a
toss
did
toby
give
him
as
sent
him
flying
across
the
room
almost
to
the
wall
the
old
man
came
down
on
his
feet
with
a
bound

stood
before
her
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
hump
was
on
his
back
in
its
rightful
place
and
he
looked
exactly
as
he
had
looked
the
first
time
freddie
had
seen
him
standing
in
the
doorway
of
the
old
tobacco
shop

flowers
by
crackey

a
moment
said
the
old
man
i
have

here
immediately
punch
laughed
immoderately
as
he
picked
up
his
own
father
and
tossed
him
in
the
air
and
hurled
him
across
the
room
the
old
man
did
not
seem
to
mind
it
a
bit
but
joined
in
the
laugh
as
he
came
down
on
his
feet
with
a
bounce
punch
was
immediately
himself
again
his
hump
was
on
his
back
his
breast
stuck
out
his
coat
and
knee
breeches
were
as
before
and
he
looked
as
if
he
might
just
have
stepped
down
from
his
wooden
box
beside
the
tobacco
shop
door
wery
glad
said
he
to
myke

with
me
old
parent
and
a
wery
good
parent
too
hif
that
enough
punch
said
his
father
now
we
bring
on
the
churchwarden
in
another
moment
the
thin
and
thomas
the
inferior
was
gone
and
in
his
place
was
the
fat
and
comfortable
churchwarden
blinking
at
his
friends
through
his
round
spectacles
i
have
been
considering
said
he
that
it
would
be
highly
desirable
after
all
i
have
passed
through
lately
to
sit
in
my
chair
on
the
pavement
against
the
wall
of
my
church
with
a
pipe
and
a
newspaper
and
i
have
concluded
that
we
will
now
call
hanlon
said
the
old
man
from
the
time
hanlon
placed
his
hands
under
the
old
man
arms
his
tongue
was
rattling
on
at
a
prodigious
speed
and
as
he
tossed
the
old
man
lightly
away
like
a
doll
he
was
saying
and
niver
once
did
the
spacheless
man
and
the
deaf
wife
have
anny
worrds
except
once
and
was
then
that
but
he
spoke
no
more
he
was
himself
again
he
was
dumb
toby
greeted
him
warmly
but
he
only
nodded
his
head
vigorously
and
smiled
his
cheerful
smile
that
all
said
the
old
man
but
the
two
old
codgers
began
toby
they
will
not
be
here
said
the
old
man
no
use
waiting
they
made
their
choice
some
time
ago
they
are
as
much
themselves
now
as
they
ever
were
and
they
will
remain
where
they
are
in
perfect
contentment
no
need
to
bother
about
them
all
that
remains
now
is
to
bid
you
farewell
and
wish
you
a
pleasant
journey
have
we
far
to
go
said
toby
you
see
said
the
old
gentleman
going
to
the
door
that
was
opposite
the
one
by
which
they
had
entered
and
throwing
it
open
he
stood
aside
as
they
passed
and
smiled
upon
each
with
a
kind
and
fatherly
smile
he
placed
his
hand
on
freddie
head
and
turned
the
little
boy
face
up
so
that
he
could
look
down
into
his
eyes
remember
he
said
never
carry
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
on
your
back
carry
him
before
you
in
your
hands
and
he
will
be
as
light
as
a
feather
now
farewell
he
gently
pushed
them
out
and
closed
the
door
behind
them
and
they
went
slowly
down
a
dark
stair
toby
held
freddie
hand
and
punch
helped
aunt
amanda
they
could
see
very
little
and
they
knew
very
little
where
they
were
until
they
found
themselves
after
a
time
on
a
level
floor
and
feeling
the
wall
with
their
hands
came
to
a
pair
of
swinging
doors
through
these
doors
they
passed
and
toby
knocked
his
knee
against
something
in
the
dark
it
a
long
bench
said
toby
and
here
a
sight
of
other
long
benches
blamed
if
they
do
seem
like
pews
in
a
church
a
dim
light
as
of
tall
windows
was
visible
at
some
distance
on
their
left
the
churchwarden
pushed
forward
and
walked
swiftly
here
and
there
with
the
step
of
one
who
knows
the
way
in
a
moment
he
returned
it
a
church
he
said
calmly
it
church
this
way
madam
and
gentlemen
he
led
the
way
to
the
left
under
a
great
round
window
which
could
be
dimly
seen
in
the
wall
was
a
wide
door
before
which
they
all
paused
as
captain
of
this
party
said
aunt
amanda
my
orders
is
that
we
open
the
door
and
see
what
will
happen
next
ay
ay
said
the
churchwarden
and
opened
the
door
in
a
moment
they
were
standing
under
the
stars
on
a
brick
pavement
before
a
church
and
on
the
pavement
against
the
church
wall
was
an
empty
chair

said
the
churchwarden
and
sat
down
in
the
chair

aunt

hanlon
after
shaking

all
round
departed
for
the
gaunt
street
theatre
where
he
would
be
no
longer
troubled
by
the
imps
who
had
long
since
been
destroyed
by
the
odour
of
sanctity
the
churchwarden
preferred
to
enjoy
for
awhile
the
comfort
of
his
old
chair
by
the
church
wall
and
toby
and
freddie
left
him
there
his
hands
folded
placidly
across
his
stomach
freddie
and
toby
crossed
the
track
hand
in
hand
together
the
horse
had
gone
to
bed
for
the
night
and
there
was
no
danger
all
the
houses
were
dark
it
was
very
late
no
light
was
to
be
seen
anywhere
except
a
at
the
next
corner
the
streets
were
silent
and
deserted
freddie
yawned
freddie
house
was
dark
like
all
the
rest
a
narrow
brick
followed
a
fence
to
the
rear
between
this
house
and
the
next
and
a
gate
opened
from
the
sidewalk
into
this
passage
freddie
and
toby
went
through
this
gate
and
crept
quietly
to
the
backyard
of
freddie
house
the
was
locked
but
toby
found
a
window
which
was
unfastened
he
raised
it
noiselessly
and
helped
freddie
to
climb
in
with
a
whispered
the
little
boy
left
his
friend
and
tiptoed
into
the
house
and
up
the
back
stairs
in
the
dark
to
his
own
room
his
bed
was
there
in
its
old
place
and
the
covers
were
turned
down
he
did
not
stop
to
say
his
prayers
he
yawned
and
stretched
his
arms
he
wanted
nothing
now
but
to
lie
snug
and
safe
under
the
cool
sheets
he
threw
off
his
clothes
and
left
them
on
the
floor
he
knew
where
his
was
he
crept
into
bed
he
pulled
the
covers
up
to
his
ears
he
nestled
his
head
into
the
pillow
and
breathed
a
deep
sigh
chapter
xxviii
the
old
tobacco
shop
the
next
morning
when
freddie
awoke
his
mother
and
father
were
standing
over
his
bed
i
think
he
had
better
not
go
there
anymore
his
father
was
saying
oh
i
do
think
it
will
do
him
any
harm
now
said
his
mother
it
all
comes
of
his
staying
away
so
long
said
his
father
i
always
told
him
to
hurry
back
and
just
see
how
long
he
stayed
this
time
if
he
ca
come
back
in
less
than
six
months
or
six
years
or
heaven
knows
how
long
he
better
not
go
at
all
oh
said
his
mother
i
sure
he
come
back
promptly
after
this
i
could
said
freddie
it
took
such
a
long
time
to
get
to
the
island
and
there
was
all
the
trouble
with
the
pirates
and
it
was
a
terrible
long
journey
before
we
got
to
the
palace
and
of
course
we
could
run
away
from
the
queen
after
we
gone
all
that
long
way
with
her
and
the
queen
children
did
want
me
to
go
anyway
and
there
was
any
way
to
get
back
except
for
finding
out
how
to
get
to
the
top
of
the
tower
and
maybe
i
would
have
got
back
at
all
if
i
had
met
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
and
got
sick
and
cured
again
by
father
and
i
might
have
got
drowned
when
the
ship
disappeared
or
i
might
have
had
my
head
cut
off
by
the
pirates
and
then
you
have
seen
me
any
more
and
you
have
been
sorry
his
father
looked
at
his
mother
and
nodded
his
head
he
better
stay
in
bed
today
said
he
we
wo
talk
to
him
about
it
until
tomorrow
yes
said
his
mother
that
will
be
much
better
poor
little
freddie
freddie
did
not
know
why
he
should
be
called
poor
but
he
was
still
tired
from
the
adventurous
life
he
had
recently
lived
and
he
was
very
glad
to
remain
in
bed
all
day
the
next
morning
after
his
father
had
said
for
the
day
his
mother
allowed
him
to
get
up
and
a
little
later
to
go
out
into
the
sunshine
he
strolled
down
the
street
enjoying
the
familiar
sights
after
his
long
absence
he
found
his
legs
a
little
weak
he
must
have
been
very
ill
indeed
at
the
king
palace
and
he
could
not
expect
to
get
over
it
in
one
day
he
crossed
the
track
and
on
the
pavement
before
the
church
he
saw
a
figure
the
churchwarden
was
sitting
in
his
chair
tilted
back
against
the
wall
smoking
a
long
pipe
and
reading
a
newspaper
as
freddie
approached
he
put
down
his
paper
and
looked
at
him
over
his
spectacles
good
morning
said
he
i
glad
to
see
you
back
again
i
hear
been
away
and
he
winked
his
eye
at
freddie
in
a
very
knowing
manner
yes
sir
said
freddie
i
guess
i
must
have
been
pretty
sick
no
doubt
about
it
my
son
but
of
course
i
knew
all
the
time
you
pull
through
freddie
did
not
believe
it
for
a
moment
obviously
the
churchwarden
was
bragging
the
street
looks
pretty
good
said
freddie
after
being
away
so
long
would
you
rather
sit
here
on
the
pavement
than
do
anything
else
i
believe
you
son
i
rather
sit
here
on
a
sunny
day
with
a
pipe
and
a
newspaper
than
have
all
the
treasure
of
the
incas
freddie
was
glad
to
hear
that
the
churchwarden
did
not
regret
the
loss
of
his
share
of
the
treasure
though
whether
captain
lingo
belonged
to
the
incas
he
did
not
know
i
do
care
anything
about
the
treasure
myself
said
he
i
too
glad
to
be
well
again
and
back
in
our
own
street
i
glad
i
here
myself
son
and
if
you
happen
to
see
toby
littleback
this
morning
tell
him
i
alive
and
resting
well
considering
yes
sir
said
freddie
and
continued
his
stroll
the
old
tobacco
shop
when
he
arrived
looked
as
it
had
looked
on
the
fateful
day
when
he
had
last
seen
it
he
paused
before
the
door
and
gazed
at
punch
he
half
expected
the
little
man
to
step
down
and
shake
hands
with
him
but
punch
did
not
move
a
muscle
he
did
not
even
look
at
freddie
he
held
out
in
one
hand
a
packet
of
black
cigars
and
his
wooden
face
if
it
expressed
anything
at
all
showed
the
great
calm
which
he
must
have
felt
when
he
got
back
to
his
little
perch
freddie
looked
up
at
the
clock
in
the
tower
with
some
thought
that
the
hands
might
be
together
but
it
was
a
quarter
past
ten
and
anyway
punch
father
was
probably
by
this
time
far
away
in
some
other
of
his
about
the
world
freddie
entered
the
shop
toby
was
behind
the
counter
opening
a
package
of
tobacco
aha
young
feller
he
cried
back
again
sure
enough
blamed
if
it
do
seem
as
if
you
been
away
from
here
for
a
year
and
a
mighty
sick
chap
you
were
that
a
fact
i
reckon
we
all
thought
you
were
going
to
die
maybe
by
crackey
i
never
seen
anyone
so
pale
in
my
life

all
right

said
freddie
and
i
glad
to
be

you
glad
to
be
here
in
the
shop
the
same
as

i
am
you

buy
me
to
leave
this
shop
not
if
you
offered
me
all
the
money
that
captain
kidd
ever
buried
no
sir
and
look
here
young
man
i
reckon
you
ai
surprised
to
see
that
the
chinaman
head
is
gone
eh
freddie
looked
at
the
shelf
behind
toby
and
sure
enough
the
head
was
gone
he
knew
of
course
that
it
was
lying
at
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
i
kind
of
lost
it
one
day
said
toby
winking
his
eye
mislaid
it
you
know
or
lost
it
one
or
the
other
i
do
know
which
but
anyway
i
reckon
it
wo
never
be
found
it
gone
i
hope
you
mind
it
now
do
you
no
sir
said
freddie
he
was
glad
to
know
that
toby
was
not
still
feeling
disturbed
because
he
had
left
it
on
board
the
sieve
all
right
then
said
toby

freddie
opened
the
door
at
the
rear
of
the
shop

back

sitting
by
the
table

looked
up
at

wondered
