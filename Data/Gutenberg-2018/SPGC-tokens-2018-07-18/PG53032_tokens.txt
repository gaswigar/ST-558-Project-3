to
his
majesty
the
king
william
tully
was
a
little
over
when
he
emerged
from
the
chrysalis
stage
of
his
clerkdom
and
became
a
social
reformer
his
life
and
doings
until
the
age
of
had
given
small
promise
of
the
distinction
of
his
future
career
from
a
and
boy
he
had
developed
into
a
little
adult
standing
five
foot
five
in
his
boots
educated
at
a
small
private
school
in
the
suburbs
of
london
his
record
for
conduct
was
practically
spotless
and
he
once
took
a
prize
for
divinity
further
to
the
surprise
and
relief
of
his
preceptors
he
managed
to
scrape
through
the
senior
cambridge
local
examination
before
he
was
transferred
to
a
desk
in
the
office
of
a
london
insurance
company
his
in
a
certificate
assured
his
future
employers
that
they
would
find
him
painstaking
and
william
for
the
first
six
years
of
his
engagement
lived
up
to
the
character
given
him
his
mother
a
masterful
woman
had
brought
him
up
to
be
painstaking
and
obedient
it
might
be
said
with
truth
that
as
long
as
she
lived
he
did
not
know
how
to
be
otherwise
it
is
true
he
disliked
his
office
superiors
vaguely
for
the
restrictions
they
placed
upon
his
as
for
the
same
reason
he
vaguely
disliked
his
mother
but
his
wishes
being
indeterminate
and
his
ambition
his
vague
dislike
never
stiffened
into
active
resentment
it
would
seem
that
the
supreme
effort
of
passing
his
cambridge
local
had
left
him
mentally
exhausted
for
a
season
at
any
rate
from
the
conclusion
of
his
till
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
faraday
his
reading
was
practically
confined
to
romantic
and
humorous
literature
he
was
a
regular
patron
of
the
fiction
department
of
the
municipal
lending
library
and
did
not
disdain
to
spend
modestly
on
periodicals
of
the
type
of
he
was
unable
to
spend
more
than
modestly
because
his
earnings
with
the
exception
of
a
small
sum
for
fares
and
were
annexed
by
his
mother
each
saturday
as
a
matter
of
normal
routine
the
manner
of
her
annexation
made
discussion
singularly
difficult
and
if
william
ever
felt
stirrings
of
rebellion
over
the
weekly
cash
delivery
he
was
careful
never
to
betray
them
with
his
colleagues
of
the
office
tully
was
a
negligible
quantity
he
was
not
was
merely
that
he
did
not
matter
his
mother
s
control
of
the
family
funds
was
no
doubt
in
part
accountable
for
his
comrades
neglect
of
his
society
but
his
own
habits
and
manners
were
still
more
largely
to
blame
since
besides
being
painstaking
and
obedient
he
was
unobtrusive
and
diffident
there
was
once
a
project
on
foot
in
the
office
to
take
him
out
and
make
him
nothing
came
of
it
because
no
one
was
sufficiently
interested
in
william
to
give
up
an
evening
to
the
job
the
crisis
in
his
hitherto
life
came
when
his
mother
died
suddenly
this
was
in
october
william
had
gone
to
the
office
as
usual
that
morning
leaving
his
mother
apparently
in
her
usual
health
he
returned
in
the
evening
to
blinds
already
drawn
down
a
neighbour
female
was
in
waiting
in
the
and
broke
the
great
news
with
a
sense
of
its
importance
and
her
own
she
took
william
s
hand
told
him
with
sniffs
that
it
was
the
will
of
the
lord
and
entered
into
clinical
details
william
sat
down
rather
suddenly
when
he
realized
that
there
would
be
no
one
in
future
to
annex
his
weekly
earnings
then
shocked
by
his
lack
of
filial
feeling
he
endeavoured
to
produce
an
emotion
more
suited
to
the
solemn
occasion
disconcerted
by
a
want
of
success
which
he
feared
was
apparent
to
his
audience
he
fidgeted
and
finally
all
things
considered
acted
well
and
wisely
by
demanding
to
be
left
alone
to
his
relief
the
demand
was
accepted
as
reasonable
and
proper
in
the
first
moments
of
his
grief
the
sympathizer
withdrew
wiping
her
hoping
that
god
would
support
him
he
locked
the
door
stealthily
and
stared
at
his
mother
s
armchair
he
was
a
little
afraid
of
its
emptiness
he
was
also
shocked
and
excited
he
knew
instinctively
that
more
was
to
happen
that
life
from
now
on
would
be
something
new
and
different
the
was
empty
the
masterful
little
woman
who
had
borne
him
slapped
him
managed
him
and
cowed
masterful
little
woman
was
dead
there
was
no
one
now
to
whom
he
was
accountable
no
one
of
whom
he
was
afraid
he
walked
on
tiptoe
round
the
tiny
room
feeling
strangely
and
pleasantly
alive
the
next
day
increased
the
sense
of
his
importance
his
mother
had
died
rich
as
he
and
she
understood
riches
she
had
trusted
her
son
in
nothing
not
even
with
the
knowledge
of
her
income
and
after
the
stinting
and
scraping
to
which
she
had
accustomed
him
he
was
amazed
to
find
himself
master
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
the
interest
on
capital
gradually
and
carefully
invested
in
his
first
trod
on
air
while
his
mind
wandered
hazily
over
the
glorious
possibilities
of
opulent
years
to
come
the
only
alloy
in
his
otherwise
supreme
content
being
the
necessity
for
preserving
at
least
until
the
funeral
was
over
a
decent
appearance
of
dejection
he
felt
too
the
need
of
a
friend
in
whom
to
confide
some
one
of
his
own
age
and
standing
before
whom
it
would
not
be
needful
to
keep
up
the
appearance
of
dejection
and
who
would
not
be
shocked
at
the
babblings
of
his
stirred
and
exultant
soul
and
it
was
this
natural
longing
for
a
confidant
which
on
the
day
following
his
mother
s
funeral
led
to
the
beginning
of
his
friendship
with
his
faraday
the
head
of
his
department
meeting
him
in
the
passage
had
said
a
few
perfunctory
and
conventional
words
of
william
had
muttered
a
sheepish
thank
you
sir
and
escaped
as
soon
as
might
be
the
familiar
office
after
his
four
days
estrangement
from
it
affected
him
curiously
and
unpleasantly
he
felt
his
sense
of
importance
slipping
gradually
away
from
him
felt
himself
becoming
once
again
the
underling
and
creature
of
william
tully
obedient
and
painstaking
who
had
earned
from
his
childhood
the
favourable
contempt
of
his
superiors
it
was
borne
in
on
him
as
the
hours
went
by
that
it
was
not
enough
to
accept
good
fortune
had
to
be
made
use
of
and
he
began
to
make
plans
in
an
irregular
tentative
fashion
biting
the
end
of
his
pen
and
neglecting
his
work
should
he
chuck
the
office
and
if
he
chucked
it
what
then
here
imagination
failed
him
his
life
had
been
so
ordered
so
bound
down
and
directed
by
others
that
even
his
desires
were
tamed
to
the
wishes
of
others
and
left
to
himself
he
could
not
tell
what
he
desired
the
need
for
sympathy
and
guidance
became
imperative
driving
him
when
the
other
occupants
of
the
room
had
departed
for
lunch
to
unbosom
himself
to
faraday
in
his
longing
to
talk
he
would
have
addressed
himself
almost
to
any
one
but
on
the
whole
and
in
spite
of
an
entire
ignorance
of
his
habits
and
character
he
was
glad
it
was
faraday
who
was
left
behind
to
hear
newcomer
recently
transferred
from
another
branch
and
as
william
realized
if
only
like
himself
regarded
by
their
as
a
bit
of
an
outsider
a
young
man
and
with
large
hazel
eyes
he
was
neatly
garbed
as
became
an
insurance
clerk
but
there
was
a
suggestion
of
discomfort
about
his
conventional
neatness
just
as
there
was
a
suggestion
of
effort
about
his
personal
cleanliness
he
worked
hard
and
steadily
taking
no
part
in
the
interludes
of
blithesome
chat
wherewith
his
companions
enlivened
their
hours
of
toil
and
appearing
to
be
satisfied
rather
than
annoyed
by
the
knowledge
of
his
own
isolation
he
had
spoken
to
william
but
two
or
three
times
and
always
in
the
way
of
was
his
profile
bent
over
a
ledger
particularly
suggestive
of
sympathy
william
s
emotions
however
had
reached
and
the
door
had
hardly
closed
behind
the
last
of
their
fellows
when
he
blurted
out
i
say
and
faraday
raised
his
head
i
say
william
blurted
again
did
you
mother
s
dead
said
faraday
uncomfortably
he
believed
he
was
being
appealed
to
for
sympathy
and
fidgeted
clearing
his
throat
had
heard
it
mentioned
i
needn
t
say
i
m
very
i
suppose
you
were
very
much
attached
to
her
william
reflected
for
a
moment
and
then
answered
honestly
no
indeed
faraday
returned
surprised
as
well
as
uncomfortable
not
knowing
what
further
to
say
his
eyes
went
back
to
the
ledger
and
the
conversation
languished
it
was
william
who
resumed
at
the
difficulty
of
expressing
his
bubbling
emotions
i
don
t
mean
to
say
he
explained
with
a
twinge
of
remorse
that
i
had
anything
to
complain
of
my
mother
always
did
her
duty
by
me
but
we
weren
t
what
you
might
call
sympathetic
indeed
faraday
at
sea
as
to
the
motive
of
the
conversation
it
was
unfortunate
william
went
on
but
it
couldn
t
be
helped
i
am
sure
she
was
a
very
good
woman
he
said
this
with
the
more
confidence
because
from
his
childhood
up
he
had
always
associated
goodness
with
lack
of
amiability
but
that
wasn
t
what
i
wanted
to
say
what
i
wanted
to
say
was
she
has
left
me
a
good
deal
of
money
indeed
said
faraday
for
the
third
time
adding
something
about
congratulation
he
hoped
the
episode
was
william
was
only
beginning
i
ve
been
wondering
he
said
what
i
should
that
i
m
independent
i
don
t
want
to
go
on
like
this
it
s
a
you
ve
got
money
but
i
don
t
know
how
to
set
about
things
if
some
one
would
put
me
in
the
way
faraday
raising
his
eyes
from
the
ledger
met
the
wistful
appeal
in
william
s
and
imagined
himself
enlightened
i
see
he
said
interrogatively
then
you
haven
t
got
your
living
to
are
not
tied
here
any
longer
you
can
direct
your
own
life
and
take
up
any
line
you
choose
yes
william
assented
pleased
with
the
phrase
i
can
direct
my
own
which
faraday
suggested
was
difficult
for
you
before
very
said
william
emphatically
and
the
other
went
on
now
that
you
are
your
own
man
you
wish
to
take
the
line
that
attracts
you
and
be
of
some
use
oh
certainly
william
assented
a
shade
less
emphatically
so
far
his
ideas
had
run
more
upon
pleasure
than
usefulness
faraday
reflected
with
his
chin
resting
on
his
hand
why
have
you
asked
me
he
demanded
the
accent
strongly
on
the
me
i
know
so
few
people
william
explained
humbly
i
mean
of
course
people
who
could
give
me
any
ideas
i
thought
you
wouldn
t
least
i
hoped
you
wouldn
t
i
know
it
s
if
you
could
help
me
in
any
way
with
suggestions
you
know
again
faraday
reflected
with
his
chin
resting
on
his
hand
i
could
put
you
he
said
at
last
in
touch
with
people
who
might
help
you
i
should
be
very
pleased
to
do
so
of
course
i
should
like
to
know
more
of
you
your
views
of
course
william
agreed
vaguely
puzzled
partly
by
the
words
and
partly
by
the
enigmatic
manner
if
you
ve
nothing
else
to
do
faraday
continued
perhaps
you
ll
come
round
to
my
rooms
for
a
talk
say
at
eight
we
could
discuss
things
more
comfortably
there
william
still
puzzled
by
the
hint
of
mystery
in
his
manner
murmured
that
he
also
should
be
very
pleased
and
faraday
gave
him
the
forthwith
to
his
ledger
in
sign
that
he
considered
the
incident
closed
for
the
present
he
had
a
distinctly
authoritative
way
with
him
and
william
who
would
gladly
have
continued
the
subject
had
perforce
to
be
content
with
wondering
what
the
night
s
discussion
and
exchange
of
views
would
bring
forth
an
evening
spent
away
from
home
was
so
rare
an
event
in
his
life
that
the
prospect
of
his
visit
to
faraday
s
rooms
afforded
him
food
for
an
afternoon
s
busy
speculation
his
own
domicile
being
in
the
region
of
camberwell
he
did
not
return
to
it
after
office
hours
but
whiled
away
the
time
by
dinner
at
an
oxford
street
glorying
in
the
length
of
his
bill
and
contrasting
his
power
of
spending
what
he
liked
with
the
old
days
of
allowance
he
rang
down
a
sovereign
at
the
gathered
up
his
change
and
strolled
out
of
the
building
with
an
at
eight
precisely
found
himself
outside
faraday
s
lodgings
in
a
mournful
in
bloomsbury
a
shabby
ushered
him
upstairs
to
a
shabby
room
where
faraday
pipe
in
mouth
rose
to
greet
him
they
were
not
long
in
finding
out
that
the
invitation
had
been
given
and
accepted
under
a
misapprehension
on
both
sides
faraday
as
soon
as
he
had
settled
his
guest
in
a
chair
came
straight
to
the
point
with
now
tell
long
have
you
been
interested
in
social
questions
in
social
questions
william
repeated
blankly
i
m
afraid
i
don
what
sort
of
questions
do
you
mean
it
was
faraday
s
turn
to
be
taken
aback
and
though
he
did
not
say
it
his
eyes
looked
then
what
the
william
s
fell
before
them
nervously
and
he
shifted
in
his
chair
like
a
child
detected
in
a
blunder
i
m
afraid
i
don
he
said
halted
then
you
didn
t
know
his
companion
queried
that
i
am
vindex
of
i
m
afraid
not
muttered
william
who
had
heard
neither
of
one
nor
the
other
vindex
of
sighed
inwardly
he
was
young
ambitious
fiercely
in
earnest
and
ever
on
the
for
his
chance
and
the
wish
being
father
to
the
thought
he
had
momentarily
mistaken
william
for
an
embodiment
of
his
chance
and
dreamed
dreams
since
the
of
a
comrade
and
willing
to
be
led
whose
riches
might
be
used
to
endow
a
periodical
that
should
preach
a
purer
and
more
violent
rebellion
even
than
itself
with
the
aid
of
william
s
three
pounds
a
many
times
over
in
the
eyes
of
his
eager
had
seen
himself
casting
the
hated
insurance
behind
him
and
devoting
himself
heart
and
pen
to
the
regeneration
of
the
state
and
race
by
means
of
the
class
war
and
lo
a
couple
more
searching
questions
revealed
to
place
of
a
patron
and
comrade
was
a
nervous
little
nincompoop
bewildered
at
finding
himself
for
the
first
time
out
of
to
whom
a
hundred
and
fifty
a
year
was
wealth
untold
and
who
had
never
so
much
as
heard
of
the
class
war
for
a
moment
he
was
more
than
half
inclined
to
be
angry
with
the
nervous
little
nincompoop
whose
blundering
egoistic
attempt
at
confidence
had
induced
him
to
believe
that
the
secret
of
his
identity
had
been
penetrated
by
an
ardent
sympathizer
it
was
an
open
secret
in
advanced
circles
though
carefully
guarded
in
the
office
then
more
justly
he
softened
recognizing
that
the
blunder
was
his
own
the
mistake
of
his
own
pitying
william
s
dropped
jaw
and
open
confusion
poured
him
out
a
whisky
and
endeavoured
to
set
him
at
his
ease
that
evening
in
the
company
of
faraday
and
his
first
whisky
was
the
in
the
career
of
william
tully
any
man
stronger
than
himself
could
at
that
juncture
in
his
life
have
turned
him
to
right
or
left
a
push
in
the
wrong
direction
would
have
made
of
him
an
idler
and
a
wastrel
and
fate
was
in
a
kindly
mood
when
she
placed
him
mentally
and
morally
in
charge
of
vindex
of
she
might
as
her
reckless
way
is
have
handed
over
his
little
soul
to
some
flamboyant
rogue
or
expert
in
small
vices
instead
she
laid
it
in
the
keeping
of
a
man
who
was
charged
with
unselfish
enthusiasm
and
never
consciously
dishonest
the
product
of
a
board
school
scholarship
and
a
fiercely
energetic
process
of
prompted
in
part
by
the
desire
to
excel
those
he
despised
faraday
when
william
made
his
acquaintance
was
beginning
to
realize
some
of
his
cherished
ambitions
beginning
in
certain
labour
and
socialist
circles
to
be
treated
as
a
man
of
mark
his
pen
was
fluent
as
well
as
sarcastic
and
if
his
numerous
contributions
to
the
rebel
press
had
been
paid
for
at
ordinary
rates
he
would
have
been
a
prosperous
journalist
it
was
somewhat
of
a
shock
to
william
to
discover
on
the
top
of
the
whisky
that
his
new
acquaintance
was
a
socialist
but
after
the
first
and
momentary
shock
he
swallowed
the
fact
as
he
had
swallowed
the
because
he
liked
it
but
because
it
was
something
the
narrow
circle
of
his
mother
s
friends
would
have
heartily
and
loudly
disapproved
of
this
reactionary
and
undutiful
attitude
of
mind
was
not
deliberate
or
conscious
on
the
contrary
he
would
certainly
have
been
horrified
to
learn
that
it
was
the
dominant
factor
in
his
existence
during
the
first
few
weeks
of
his
emancipation
from
maternal
supervision
and
him
to
drink
deeply
of
faraday
s
brand
of
socialism
as
it
urged
him
to
partake
with
unnecessary
sumptuousness
of
the
best
that
lyons
could
provide
he
acquired
the
taste
for
faraday
s
political
views
more
thoroughly
and
easily
than
the
taste
for
faraday
s
whisky
the
man
s
authoritative
and
easy
manner
the
manner
which
stood
him
in
good
stead
with
his
audiences
of
assuming
quite
honestly
that
his
statements
were
proven
facts
which
no
sane
human
being
could
dispute
would
have
made
it
impossible
for
william
to
combat
his
opinions
even
had
his
limited
reading
and
thinking
supplied
him
with
material
for
the
contest
he
was
impressed
with
faraday
s
erudition
no
less
than
with
faraday
s
manner
and
impressed
still
more
when
later
in
the
evening
a
colleague
of
dropped
in
for
a
smoke
and
a
chat
the
pair
talked
labour
and
international
movements
with
the
careless
ease
of
connoisseurs
and
bandied
the
names
of
politicians
contemptuously
from
mouth
to
sitting
by
in
a
silence
dazed
and
awed
drinking
in
a
language
that
attracted
by
its
wild
incomprehensibility
and
suggestion
his
mind
was
blank
and
virgin
for
the
sowing
of
any
seed
and
under
faraday
s
influence
his
dull
resentment
against
the
restrictions
physical
and
mental
of
his
hitherto
narrow
life
became
merged
in
a
wider
sympathy
with
the
general
discomfort
in
an
honest
and
fiery
little
passion
for
justice
right
and
progress
that
of
course
was
not
the
affair
of
one
evening
s
talk
but
even
the
one
evening
s
talk
sowed
the
seeds
he
went
away
from
it
uncomfortably
conscious
that
as
yet
he
had
lived
solely
for
himself
never
troubling
his
head
concerning
the
evils
that
men
like
faraday
were
fighting
to
overcome
the
manner
of
his
future
living
was
decided
for
him
when
he
knocked
at
the
door
of
faraday
s
bloomsbury
lodging
his
simple
and
awed
admiration
for
his
friend
and
faith
had
in
all
probability
more
than
a
little
to
do
with
faraday
s
readiness
to
allow
the
acquaintance
to
a
rebel
prophet
is
not
insensible
to
flattery
william
became
for
a
time
his
satellite
and
pupil
the
admiring
sharer
of
his
schemes
of
his
hatreds
and
laudable
ambitions
he
read
faraday
s
vehement
articles
and
accepted
each
word
and
line
his
very
blankness
of
mind
made
him
an
apt
pupil
and
within
a
month
of
his
mother
s
death
he
was
living
out
of
office
hours
in
a
whirl
of
agitation
attending
meetings
and
cramming
his
head
with
pamphlets
in
three
months
more
all
his
hours
were
hours
in
his
enthusiasm
for
his
new
creed
and
interests
his
neglect
of
his
professional
duties
had
become
so
marked
that
the
manager
after
one
or
two
warnings
called
him
into
his
room
for
a
solemn
and
last
reprimand
as
it
happened
faraday
the
night
before
had
confided
to
william
the
news
of
his
approaching
appointment
to
the
post
of
organizing
secretary
of
the
independent
socialist
party
an
appointment
which
would
entail
a
speedy
retirement
from
his
hated
desk
in
the
city
the
news
naturally
had
not
increased
the
attraction
of
the
office
for
william
in
whom
the
spirit
of
revolt
had
already
fermented
to
some
purpose
thus
to
the
infinite
surprise
of
his
superiors
who
had
known
him
hitherto
as
the
meekest
of
meek
little
clerks
the
threat
of
dismissal
failing
improvement
was
countered
by
a
prompt
resignation
as
truculent
as
william
could
make
it
in
fact
in
the
exhilaration
of
the
moment
he
treated
the
astonished
representative
of
capitalism
to
something
in
the
nature
of
a
principally
from
the
writings
of
vindex
from
that
day
onwards
he
devoted
himself
to
what
he
termed
public
ferment
of
protestation
and
grievance
sometimes
genuine
sometimes
manufactured
or
at
least
artificially
heightened
he
was
an
extremist
passionately
and
with
all
the
extremist
s
contempt
for
those
who
balance
see
difficulties
and
strive
to
give
the
other
side
its
due
he
began
by
haunting
meetings
as
a
listener
and
a
steward
faraday
s
meetings
at
first
then
as
his
circle
of
acquaintance
and
interest
widened
any
sort
of
demonstration
that
promised
a
sufficiency
of
excitement
in
the
form
of
invective
the
gentlest
of
creatures
by
nature
and
in
private
life
he
grew
to
delight
in
denunciation
and
under
its
ceaseless
influence
the
world
divided
itself
into
two
camps
the
good
and
enlightened
who
agreed
with
him
and
the
fools
and
miscreants
who
did
not
in
short
he
became
a
politician
as
i
have
said
at
the
outset
of
his
career
he
modestly
confined
his
energies
to
the
sale
of
what
propagandist
bodies
insist
on
describing
as
literature
the
taking
of
tickets
ushering
to
seats
and
the
like
but
in
a
short
time
ambition
fired
him
and
the
fighting
spirit
thereby
engendered
led
him
to
opposition
meetings
where
on
faraday
s
advice
he
tried
heckling
the
enemy
speakers
his
first
and
flustered
attempts
were
not
but
sustained
by
revolutionary
enthusiasm
he
refused
to
be
crushed
by
failure
and
accompanying
jeers
and
held
doggedly
on
to
his
purpose
repeated
efforts
brought
their
measure
of
success
and
he
began
to
be
marked
by
his
comrades
as
a
willing
and
valuable
member
within
a
year
he
had
found
his
feet
and
was
a
busy
and
the
species
that
can
be
relied
on
to
turn
on
at
any
moment
a
glib
excited
stream
of
partisan
fact
and
sentiment
his
services
were
in
constant
demand
since
he
spoke
for
anything
and
only
the
promoters
of
the
meeting
were
sufficiently
violent
in
their
efforts
to
upset
the
prevailing
order
he
had
developed
and
was
pleased
with
himself
faraday
though
still
a
great
man
in
his
eyes
was
more
of
an
equal
than
an
idol
he
was
wonderfully
happy
in
his
new
unrestful
existence
it
was
not
only
that
he
knew
he
was
doing
great
good
and
that
applause
uplifted
him
and
went
to
his
head
like
wine
as
a
member
of
an
organization
and
swayed
by
its
collective
passion
he
attained
to
and
was
conscious
of
an
emotional
and
as
he
thought
intellectual
activity
of
which
as
an
individual
he
would
have
been
entirely
incapable
as
a
deceased
statesman
was
intoxicated
with
the
exuberance
of
his
own
verbosity
so
william
was
intoxicated
with
the
exuberance
of
his
own
emotions
there
were
moments
when
he
looked
back
on
his
old
life
and
could
hardly
believe
he
was
the
same
william
tully
who
once
without
thought
of
the
social
revolution
went
daily
from
camberwell
to
the
city
and
back
from
the
city
to
camberwell
as
time
went
on
he
was
entrusted
with
campaigns
and
the
stirring
up
of
revolt
and
it
was
a
proud
day
for
him
when
a
conservative
evening
paper
in
connection
with
his
share
in
a
mining
agitation
referred
to
him
as
a
dangerous
man
he
wondered
with
pity
for
her
blindness
what
his
mother
would
have
thought
if
any
one
had
told
her
in
her
lifetime
that
her
son
would
turn
out
dangerous
as
a
matter
of
course
he
was
a
supporter
of
votes
for
women
an
adherent
equally
as
a
matter
of
course
of
the
movement
in
its
noisiest
and
most
intolerant
form
he
signed
petitions
denouncing
forcible
feeding
and
attended
meetings
advocating
civil
war
where
the
civil
warriors
complained
with
bitterness
that
the
other
side
had
hit
them
back
and
his
contempt
for
the
less
virulent
form
of
suffragist
was
as
great
as
his
contempt
for
the
home
secretary
and
the
orthodox
members
of
the
labour
party
it
was
at
one
of
these
meetings
in
december
that
he
met
griselda
watkins
griselda
watkins
then
a
little
under
was
his
exact
counterpart
in
petticoats
a
piece
of
suburban
caught
into
the
militant
suffrage
movement
and
enjoying
herself
therein
she
was
inclined
to
plumpness
had
a
fresh
complexion
a
mouth
slightly
ajar
and
suggestive
of
adenoids
and
the
satisfied
expression
which
comes
from
a
spirit
at
rest
like
william
she
had
found
peace
of
mind
and
perennial
interest
in
the
hearty
denunciation
of
those
who
did
not
agree
with
her
on
the
night
when
william
first
saw
her
she
wore
as
a
steward
a
white
dress
a
sash
with
the
colours
of
her
association
and
a
badge
denoting
that
she
had
suffered
for
the
cause
in
holloway
her
manner
was
eminently
and
assured
but
at
the
same
time
almost
ostentatiously
gracious
and
womanly
it
was
the
policy
of
her
particular
branch
of
the
suffrage
movement
to
repress
manifestations
of
the
masculine
type
in
its
members
and
encourage
fluffiness
of
garb
and
appeal
of
manner
griselda
who
had
a
natural
weakness
for
cheap
finery
was
a
warm
adherent
of
the
policy
went
out
in
a
and
cultivated
ladylike
charm
she
introduced
herself
to
william
after
the
meeting
with
a
compliment
on
his
speech
which
had
been
fiery
enough
even
for
her
they
both
considered
the
compliment
graceful
and
for
a
few
minutes
exchanged
sympathetic
platitudes
on
martyrdom
civil
war
and
the
scoundrelly
behaviour
of
the
government
even
in
those
first
few
minutes
they
were
conscious
of
attraction
for
each
other
and
pleased
to
discover
in
the
course
of
their
talk
that
they
should
meet
again
next
week
on
another
militant
platform
they
met
and
first
only
on
platforms
afterwards
more
privately
and
pleasantly
william
when
his
own
meetings
did
not
claim
him
took
to
following
griselda
about
to
hers
that
he
might
listen
entranced
to
the
words
of
enthusiastic
abuse
that
flowed
from
her
confident
lips
he
had
heard
them
all
before
and
from
speakers
as
confident
but
never
before
had
they
seemed
so
inspired
and
inspiring
never
before
had
he
desired
with
trembling
to
kiss
the
lips
that
uttered
them
griselda
touched
as
a
woman
and
flattered
as
an
orator
by
his
persistent
presence
in
her
audience
invited
him
to
tea
at
her
aunt
s
house
in
balham
the
visit
was
a
success
and
from
that
evening
in
early
march
the
end
was
a
foregone
conclusion
their
friendship
ripened
so
fast
that
one
night
at
the
beginning
of
april
william
escorting
her
home
from
a
meeting
proposed
to
her
on
the
top
of
an
otherwise
empty
bus
and
was
duly
and
sweetly
accepted
there
were
none
of
the
customary
obstacles
in
the
way
of
the
happy
the
contrary
all
was
plain
sailing
william
s
original
income
had
for
some
years
been
augmented
by
his
earnings
as
a
speaker
and
griselda
s
parents
had
left
her
modestly
provided
for
her
aunt
long
since
converted
to
the
movement
to
the
extent
of
being
unable
to
talk
of
anything
but
forcible
feeding
smiled
blessings
on
so
suitable
a
match
and
proceeded
to
consider
the
trousseau
and
after
a
little
persuasion
on
part
the
wedding
was
fixed
for
july
the
mating
of
william
and
griselda
might
be
called
an
ideal
mating
theirs
were
indeed
two
hearts
that
beat
as
one
with
each
day
they
were
happier
in
each
other
s
company
their
minds
as
it
were
flowed
together
and
intermingled
so
alike
and
akin
that
it
would
have
been
difficult
without
hearing
the
voice
that
spoke
it
to
distinguish
an
utterance
of
griselda
from
an
idea
formulated
by
william
their
prominent
blue
both
had
prominent
blue
out
upon
the
world
from
exactly
the
same
point
of
view
and
as
they
had
been
trained
by
the
same
influences
and
were
incapable
of
forming
an
independent
judgment
it
would
not
have
been
easy
to
find
cause
of
disagreement
between
them
there
are
men
and
women
not
a
few
who
find
their
complement
in
their
contrast
but
of
such
were
not
william
and
griselda
their
standard
of
conduct
was
rigid
and
their
views
were
pronounced
those
who
did
not
share
their
views
and
act
in
conformity
with
their
standards
were
outside
the
pale
of
their
liking
and
this
not
because
they
were
abnormally
or
essentially
uncharitable
but
because
they
had
lived
for
so
long
less
as
individuals
than
as
members
of
form
of
existence
which
will
end
by
sucking
charity
out
of
the
sweetest
heart
alive
it
was
well
for
them
therefore
that
their
creed
like
their
code
of
manners
and
morals
was
identical
or
practically
identical
it
was
a
simple
creed
and
they
held
to
it
loyally
and
faithfully
they
believed
in
a
large
vague
and
beautifully
undefined
identity
called
by
william
the
people
and
by
griselda
woman
who
in
the
time
to
come
was
to
accomplish
much
beautiful
and
undefined
good
and
in
whose
service
they
were
prepared
meanwhile
to
suffer
any
amount
of
obloquy
and
talk
any
amount
of
nonsense
they
believed
that
society
could
be
straightened
and
set
right
by
the
efforts
of
souls
like
by
the
ballot
the
voice
of
the
people
and
woman
they
believed
in
defiance
of
the
teachings
of
history
that
democracy
is
another
word
for
peace
and
goodwill
towards
men
they
believed
quite
rightly
in
the
purity
of
their
own
intentions
and
concluded
quite
wrongly
that
the
intentions
of
all
persons
who
did
not
agree
with
them
must
therefore
be
evil
and
impure
they
were
in
short
very
honest
and
devout
contemptuous
intolerant
after
the
manner
of
their
kind
they
held
as
i
have
said
to
their
own
opinions
strongly
and
would
have
died
rather
than
renounce
or
seem
to
renounce
did
not
restrain
them
from
resenting
the
same
attitude
of
mind
and
heart
in
others
what
in
themselves
they
admired
as
loyalty
they
denounced
in
others
as
interested
and
malignant
stubbornness
did
not
prevent
them
from
disliking
and
despising
many
excellent
persons
whose
opinions
if
analysed
would
have
proved
nearly
akin
to
their
own
william
for
instance
would
all
but
foam
at
the
mouth
when
compulsory
service
in
the
army
was
the
subject
of
conversation
and
militarism
to
him
was
the
blackest
of
all
the
works
of
the
devil
but
he
was
bitter
and
violently
bitter
against
the
blackleg
who
objected
to
compulsory
service
in
a
trade
union
and
had
spoken
times
without
number
in
hearty
encouragement
of
that
form
of
siege
warfare
which
is
commonly
known
as
a
strike
he
was
a
pacifist
of
the
type
which
seeks
peace
and
ensues
it
by
insisting
firmly
and
even
to
blood
that
it
is
the
other
side
s
duty
to
give
way
griselda
also
was
a
it
suited
her
and
when
she
had
got
her
way
she
believed
in
a
future
brought
about
chiefly
by
woman
meanwhile
she
exulted
loudly
and
frequently
in
the
fighting
qualities
of
her
sex
like
william
she
had
no
quarrel
with
continental
nations
on
the
contrary
what
she
had
seen
of
continental
nations
during
a
fortnight
s
stay
at
interlaken
had
inclined
her
to
look
on
them
with
favour
like
william
her
combatant
instincts
were
concentrated
on
antagonists
nearer
home
she
knew
them
better
and
therefore
disliked
them
more
it
is
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
either
nations
or
individuals
will
necessarily
like
the
people
they
see
most
of
if
you
must
know
a
man
in
order
to
love
him
you
seldom
hate
a
man
with
whom
you
have
not
acquaintance
nothing
could
have
been
more
ideally
peaceful
than
the
relations
of
china
and
england
during
the
middle
the
simple
reason
that
china
and
england
knew
absolutely
nothing
of
each
other
in
the
same
way
if
in
a
lesser
degree
griselda
and
william
had
a
friendly
feeling
for
germany
and
the
german
people
they
had
never
been
to
germany
and
knew
nothing
of
her
history
or
politics
but
they
had
heard
of
the
germans
as
intelligent
people
addicted
to
spectacles
beer
and
sonatas
and
established
on
the
banks
of
the
rhine
rhine
being
some
way
liked
them
as
internationalists
they
had
no
words
too
strong
for
standing
armies
and
their
methods
but
upon
military
operations
against
domestic
tyrants
they
looked
with
less
disapproval
there
existed
i
believe
in
the
back
of
their
minds
some
distinction
between
bloodshed
perpetrated
by
persons
clad
in
uniform
and
by
persons
not
so
fighting
with
bayonets
and
fighting
with
bombs
and
brickbats
the
one
was
militarism
and
unjustifiable
the
other
heroism
and
holy
had
you
been
unkind
enough
to
pen
them
into
a
corner
and
force
them
to
acknowledge
that
there
are
many
born
warriors
out
of
khaki
they
would
have
ended
probably
by
declaring
that
one
should
take
arms
only
against
tyranny
and
in
a
righteous
so
have
found
themselves
in
entire
agreement
not
only
with
their
adversary
but
with
the
tory
party
the
german
emperor
the
professional
soldier
and
poor
humanity
in
general
the
elect
when
one
comes
to
examine
them
are
not
always
so
very
elect
the
difficulty
would
have
been
to
persuade
them
that
there
could
be
two
opinions
concerning
a
cause
they
espoused
their
little
vision
was
as
narrow
as
it
was
pure
and
their
little
minds
were
so
seldom
exhausted
by
thinking
apostles
of
the
reign
of
woman
and
of
international
amity
they
might
have
been
summed
up
as
the
perfect
type
of
aggressor
with
regard
to
what
used
to
be
called
culture
before
august
the
attainments
of
william
and
griselda
were
very
much
on
a
level
they
read
newspapers
written
by
persons
who
wholly
agreed
with
their
views
they
read
pamphlets
issued
and
books
recommended
by
societies
of
which
they
were
members
from
these
they
quoted
in
public
and
imposingly
with
absolute
faith
in
their
statements
of
history
and
science
of
literature
and
art
they
knew
nothing
or
next
to
nothing
and
their
ignorance
being
mutual
neither
bored
the
other
by
straying
away
from
the
subjects
in
which
both
were
interested
as
i
have
said
their
mating
was
an
ideal
mating
the
period
of
their
engagement
was
not
without
its
beauty
an
consciousness
of
their
mission
to
mankind
did
not
prevent
them
from
being
blissful
as
loving
young
couples
are
merely
coloured
their
relations
and
spiritualized
them
one
evening
not
long
before
their
wedding
they
sat
together
in
battersea
park
on
a
bench
and
dedicated
their
mutual
lives
to
the
service
of
progress
and
humanity
they
had
invented
a
suitable
formula
for
the
occasion
and
repeated
it
softly
one
after
the
other
holding
each
other
s
hands
griselda
s
voice
trembled
as
she
vowed
in
phraseology
that
not
even
her
great
love
for
william
should
wean
her
from
her
life
s
work
and
william
s
voice
shook
back
as
he
vowed
in
his
turn
that
not
even
griselda
the
woman
of
his
dreams
should
make
him
neglectful
of
the
call
of
mankind
and
his
duty
to
the
holiest
of
causes
it
was
a
very
solemn
little
moment
man
and
woman
affianced
lovers
they
dedicated
themselves
to
their
mission
the
uplifting
of
the
human
race
they
were
spared
the
doubts
which
would
have
assailed
wiser
heads
as
to
the
manner
of
accomplishing
their
mission
and
as
they
sat
side
by
side
on
the
bench
with
their
hands
clasped
they
knew
themselves
for
acceptable
types
and
forerunners
of
the
world
they
were
helping
to
create
man
and
woman
side
by
side
vowed
to
service
we
shall
never
forget
this
evening
griselda
whispered
as
the
sun
dipped
down
in
glory
in
all
our
lives
there
can
be
nothing
more
beautiful
than
this
she
was
right
the
two
best
gifts
of
life
are
love
and
an
approving
conscience
these
twain
william
and
griselda
loved
each
other
not
with
the
tempestuous
passion
of
a
romeo
and
a
juliet
with
an
honest
and
healthy
affection
they
had
for
each
other
an
attraction
which
could
set
their
pulses
beating
and
start
them
dreaming
dreams
that
evening
on
the
bench
in
battersea
park
they
had
dreamed
their
their
consciences
looked
on
and
smiled
they
foreshadowed
their
home
not
only
as
a
nest
where
they
two
and
their
children
should
dwell
but
as
a
centre
of
light
and
they
understood
duty
and
light
a
for
the
where
fresh
courage
could
be
gathered
for
the
strife
with
prejudice
and
evil
they
pictured
themselves
this
was
in
june
as
what
they
would
have
called
a
man
and
a
woman
working
for
progress
and
destined
to
leave
their
mark
the
sense
of
their
destiny
awed
and
elated
they
walked
away
from
battersea
park
with
their
hearts
too
full
for
speech
on
the
way
home
a
flaring
headline
distracted
griselda
temporarily
from
her
dreams
who
s
this
archduke
that
s
been
assassinated
she
asked
her
morning
s
reading
had
been
confined
to
austrian
william
informed
her
he
had
read
the
franz
franz
heir
to
the
austrian
throne
who
assassinated
him
his
betrothed
inquired
not
very
much
interested
i
can
t
remember
their
names
william
admitted
but
there
seem
to
have
been
several
in
it
anyhow
he
s
been
assassinated
somewhere
in
the
balkans
with
bombs
oh
said
griselda
ceasing
to
be
interested
at
all
her
mind
had
turned
from
traffic
in
strange
archdukes
and
was
running
on
a
high
resolve
the
solemn
vow
of
service
was
translating
itself
into
action
i
shall
go
to
the
meeting
she
announced
and
make
my
protest
william
knew
what
was
passing
in
her
mind
and
made
no
effort
to
dissuade
her
no
more
than
she
dared
he
let
their
mutual
happiness
enervate
must
urge
them
to
high
endeavour
to
struggle
and
sacrifice
for
the
cause
i
ll
go
too
he
said
simply
if
i
can
manage
to
get
a
ticket
oh
i
ll
get
you
a
ticket
griselda
told
him
they
re
sure
to
have
some
at
the
office
thanked
him
with
a
squeeze
of
the
fingers
that
set
his
pulses
beating
she
was
as
good
as
her
word
and
the
next
night
saw
him
in
a
cabinet
minister
s
audience
from
his
seat
in
the
arena
their
seats
were
not
together
and
the
pair
had
entered
separately
his
eye
sought
for
griselda
and
found
her
easily
in
the
first
row
of
the
obviously
composed
and
with
her
gloved
hands
folded
on
the
rail
she
was
dressed
in
pale
blue
with
a
flowered
toque
perched
on
her
head
her
blue
silk
blouse
in
view
of
possibilities
was
firmly
connected
by
with
the
belt
of
her
blue
cloth
skirt
and
her
hair
secured
more
tightly
than
usual
by
an
extra
allowance
of
combs
previous
experience
had
taught
her
the
wisdom
of
these
measures
as
usual
in
accordance
with
the
tradition
of
her
party
she
had
insisted
in
her
costume
on
the
note
her
blouse
savoured
of
liberty
and
there
was
a
cluster
of
rosebuds
at
her
breast
she
was
breathing
quickly
so
her
mouth
was
more
open
than
usual
otherwise
she
gave
no
sign
of
mental
or
physical
a
studied
indifference
which
might
have
betrayed
her
to
an
eye
sufficiently
acute
to
william
she
looked
adorable
and
his
heart
swelled
with
admiration
of
her
courage
and
determination
to
sustain
her
in
her
protest
to
the
uttermost
he
vowed
to
himself
to
be
worthy
of
such
a
mate
he
did
his
best
to
prove
himself
worthy
when
the
critical
moment
came
he
waited
for
that
moment
during
more
than
of
an
griselda
was
not
without
confederates
and
three
ladies
in
picture
hats
and
a
gentleman
in
the
garb
of
a
nonconformist
minister
had
arisen
at
intervals
to
make
the
running
before
her
voice
rang
out
all
were
suppressed
though
not
without
excitement
two
of
the
ladies
parted
with
their
hats
and
the
clergyman
broke
a
chair
the
chair
and
the
clergyman
having
been
alike
removed
the
audience
buzzed
down
into
silence
and
for
full
five
minutes
there
was
the
speaker
permitted
himself
a
jesting
allusion
to
the
recently
exported
objectors
a
man
with
a
steward
s
rosette
in
his
coat
was
stationed
in
the
gangway
close
to
william
and
as
the
laughter
the
jest
had
provoked
died
away
he
swore
under
his
breath
by
god
there
s
another
in
the
balcony
william
swung
round
saw
griselda
on
her
feet
and
heard
her
voice
shrill
him
an
inspiration
and
a
clarion
to
the
steward
a
source
of
profanity
chairman
i
rise
to
protest
against
the
speaker
s
gross
insult
to
the
noble
women
a
man
in
the
seat
behind
clapped
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
and
rammed
her
back
into
her
she
writhed
vigorously
calling
him
coward
and
demanding
how
he
dared
his
grip
sufficiently
hard
to
be
unpleasant
roused
her
fighting
instincts
and
gave
a
fillip
to
her
conscientious
protest
in
contact
with
actual
if
not
painful
personal
violence
she
found
it
easier
to
scream
hit
out
and
struggle
two
stewards
starting
from
either
end
of
the
row
of
chairs
were
wedging
themselves
towards
her
she
clung
to
her
seat
with
fingers
and
toes
and
shrieked
a
regulation
formula
which
the
meeting
drowned
in
opprobrium
conscious
of
rectitude
the
jeers
and
hoots
but
encouraged
her
and
fired
her
blood
and
when
her
hands
were
wrenched
from
their
hold
on
the
chair
she
clung
and
clawed
to
the
shoulder
of
her
stout
and
orthodox
liberal
who
thrust
her
from
him
snorting
indignation
one
steward
had
her
gripped
under
the
armpits
the
other
with
difficulty
mastered
her
active
ankles
and
wriggling
like
a
blue
silk
eel
and
crowing
her
indefatigable
protest
she
was
bundled
in
rapid
and
fashion
to
a
side
entrance
of
the
building
cowards
she
ejaculated
as
she
found
her
feet
on
the
pavement
damned
little
cat
was
the
ungentlemanly
rejoinder
if
you
come
here
again
i
ll
pare
your
nasty
little
nails
for
you
and
dabbing
a
scored
left
hand
with
his
handkerchief
the
steward
returned
to
his
griselda
in
the
centre
of
a
jocular
crowd
attracted
to
the
spot
by
several
previous
ejections
she
was
minus
her
rosebuds
her
toque
and
quite
half
of
her
hairpins
on
the
other
hand
she
held
tightly
grasped
in
her
fingers
a
crumpled
silk
necktie
which
had
once
been
the
property
of
a
stout
and
orthodox
liberal
she
was
conscious
that
she
had
acted
with
perfect
dignity
as
well
as
with
unusual
that
consciousness
combined
with
her
experience
of
similar
situations
enabled
her
to
sustain
with
calm
contempt
the
attentions
of
the
jocular
crowd
you
d
like
a
taxi
i
suppose
miss
the
constable
on
duty
also
considerable
experience
of
similar
situations
griselda
assented
and
the
taxi
was
duly
hailed
before
it
arrived
at
the
kerb
she
was
joined
on
the
pavement
by
her
lover
who
had
left
the
meeting
by
the
same
door
as
his
betrothed
and
in
much
the
same
manner
and
condition
he
had
parted
with
a
shoe
as
well
as
a
hat
and
one
of
his
braces
was
broken
a
hearty
shove
assisted
him
down
the
steps
to
the
pavement
where
to
the
applause
of
the
unthinking
multitude
he
fell
on
his
knees
in
an
attitude
of
adoration
before
griselda
s
friend
the
constable
recovering
his
equilibrium
he
would
have
turned
again
to
the
assault
but
his
game
attempt
to
the
building
was
frustrated
not
only
by
a
solidly
extended
arm
of
the
law
but
by
the
intervention
of
griselda
herself
you
have
done
enough
for
dear
she
whispered
taking
his
arm
my
instructions
are
not
to
insist
on
arrest
we
have
made
our
can
afford
to
withdraw
she
led
the
retreat
to
the
taxi
with
a
dignity
born
of
practice
william
now
conscious
of
his
snapped
brace
following
with
less
deportment
the
vehicle
once
clear
of
the
jeering
crowd
griselda
put
her
arms
round
her
lover
and
kissed
his
forehead
solemnly
my
dear
one
she
said
i
am
proud
of
you
oh
griselda
i
m
proud
of
you
he
murmured
between
their
kisses
how
brave
you
wonderful
dared
they
i
went
nearly
mad
when
i
saw
them
handling
hit
out
and
the
cowards
knocked
me
down
a
woman
raising
her
voice
on
the
side
of
they
silence
her
with
brutal
it
s
only
what
we
must
expect
dear
she
whispered
back
stroking
his
rumpled
hair
remember
this
is
knows
it
s
horrible
but
we
must
not
shrink
from
it
she
spoke
from
her
heart
from
the
profound
ignorance
of
the
unread
and
unimaginative
and
once
more
in
the
darkness
of
the
taxi
the
warriors
clasped
and
kissed
after
the
usual
hesitations
and
excursions
they
had
settled
on
their
future
tiny
flat
in
bloomsbury
central
and
handy
for
the
perpetual
getting
about
to
meetings
which
was
so
integral
a
part
of
their
bustling
lives
they
furnished
it
lovingly
and
with
what
they
considered
good
taste
griselda
brought
in
her
friends
to
admire
and
engaged
a
respectable
woman
who
was
to
do
for
them
and
have
all
in
readiness
when
they
returned
from
their
four
weeks
they
were
as
foolishly
happy
over
their
nest
as
any
other
loving
little
couple
they
were
married
towards
the
end
of
be
exact
on
the
day
of
the
month
the
wedding
took
place
in
balham
from
the
house
of
griselda
s
aunt
the
ceremony
was
performed
by
an
enlightened
vicar
who
had
consented
to
omit
the
ignoble
vow
of
obedience
and
the
church
was
thronged
to
its
doors
with
comrades
and
ardent
sympathizers
the
advanced
press
spread
itself
over
the
description
of
the
ceremony
view
of
the
fact
that
the
bridesmaids
six
in
number
had
all
done
time
for
the
press
that
was
not
advanced
considered
the
event
worth
a
paragraph
the
pair
were
snapshotted
on
leaving
the
church
with
the
customary
direful
results
and
the
modest
residence
of
griselda
s
aunt
could
hardly
accommodate
the
flood
of
progressive
guests
there
was
rice
and
and
a
whirl
of
good
griselda
flushed
looked
pretty
and
in
william
s
eyes
quite
lovely
they
left
by
an
afternoon
train
for
dover
and
crossed
the
next
day
to
ostend
their
selection
of
the
belgian
ardennes
for
a
honeymoon
was
due
to
griselda
s
acquaintance
with
a
cosmopolitan
female
revolutionist
understood
to
be
of
russian
polish
extraction
owing
it
was
further
understood
to
her
pronounced
opinions
and
pronounced
manner
of
expressing
them
she
had
long
ceased
to
be
welcome
in
the
land
that
gave
her
birth
at
any
rate
she
avoided
it
studiously
and
existed
chiefly
at
a
series
of
revolutionary
meetings
which
she
addressed
by
turns
in
bad
german
worse
french
and
worst
english
she
wrote
vehement
pamphlets
in
all
these
languages
and
prided
herself
on
the
fact
that
on
the
continent
at
least
they
were
frequently
suppressed
by
the
police
wore
tartan
blouses
a
perennial
smile
and
a
hat
that
was
always
askew
for
some
reason
or
another
she
was
the
possessor
of
a
cottage
in
the
heart
of
the
belgian
she
visited
on
the
rare
occasions
when
she
was
not
plying
her
activities
in
london
vienna
or
new
york
a
week
once
a
year
was
about
all
the
use
she
made
of
after
her
seven
days
seclusion
with
a
brace
of
new
pamphlets
burning
for
the
press
and
like
a
giant
refreshed
for
the
fight
this
estimable
woman
was
as
as
she
was
revolutionary
and
hearing
that
griselda
was
thinking
of
a
rural
honeymoon
she
hastened
to
offer
the
happy
couple
the
loan
of
her
belgian
property
which
was
as
secluded
as
heart
could
desire
griselda
since
her
fortnight
at
interlaken
had
hankered
for
another
stay
abroad
she
jumped
at
the
offer
and
acquaintance
with
foreign
parts
was
limited
to
an
international
socialist
congress
in
gladly
in
unison
with
her
madame
amberg
beamed
with
joy
at
their
delighted
acceptance
of
her
offer
she
kissed
griselda
shook
hands
with
william
and
promised
to
make
all
the
necessary
arrangements
for
their
write
to
the
old
woman
who
looked
after
the
cottage
and
tell
her
when
to
expect
them
she
babbled
rhapsodically
of
honeymoons
and
the
joys
of
the
forest
of
how
bored
she
was
in
the
forest
of
arden
at
the
end
of
a
stay
further
directed
them
how
to
reach
it
looked
out
trains
and
suggested
hotels
heaven
smiled
on
the
opening
of
their
married
life
dover
was
a
receding
beauty
in
the
distance
and
the
channel
a
lake
as
their
boat
chunked
between
the
long
piers
of
ostend
they
held
and
squeezed
each
other
s
hands
ecstatically
the
crowd
collecting
on
the
gangway
side
enabling
them
to
do
so
unnoticed
the
consciousness
of
their
total
ignorance
of
the
language
of
the
country
gave
them
an
agitated
moment
as
they
set
foot
on
foreign
taken
in
tow
by
a
polyglot
porter
they
were
safely
transferred
from
the
quay
to
a
carriage
with
instructions
to
change
at
brussels
and
having
changed
obediently
were
in
due
course
set
down
at
namur
madame
amberg
had
advised
them
to
lodge
with
economy
at
the
hotel
de
hollande
near
the
station
but
another
specimen
of
the
polyglot
porter
pounced
down
and
annexed
them
firmly
for
his
own
more
distant
establishment
and
after
a
feeble
resistance
they
followed
him
meekly
and
were
thrust
with
their
bags
into
the
omnibus
lying
in
wait
for
them
they
felt
it
their
duty
as
the
vehicle
rattled
them
along
to
make
a
few
depreciatory
and
remarks
on
the
subject
of
the
towering
fortifications
but
having
thus
satisfied
their
consciences
they
relapsed
into
mere
enjoyment
of
rest
novelty
a
good
dinner
and
a
view
of
the
lazy
meuse
after
dinner
when
the
fortress
above
them
was
fading
into
the
soft
blackness
of
a
warm
summer
night
they
walked
by
the
river
and
were
quite
unutterably
happy
they
rose
early
in
the
morning
to
catch
the
little
river
boat
for
dinant
caught
it
with
the
aid
of
their
guardian
the
porter
and
camped
side
by
side
on
its
deck
to
enjoy
the
sauntering
trip
they
enjoyed
it
so
much
and
engrossingly
that
for
the
space
of
a
morning
they
forgot
their
high
principles
they
forgot
even
woman
and
democracy
they
were
tourists
only
agape
and
delighted
with
their
green
cook
s
tickets
in
their
pockets
yet
after
all
they
were
something
more
than
tourists
they
were
young
man
and
woman
who
loved
each
other
tenderly
and
whose
happy
lives
were
in
tune
with
the
happy
landscape
often
they
forgot
to
look
at
the
happy
landscape
for
the
joy
of
gazing
into
each
other
s
dear
blue
eyes
the
boat
puffed
finally
to
dinant
where
they
stayed
the
night
as
planned
where
they
stared
at
the
cupola
d
church
and
the
cliffs
walked
to
the
split
rock
on
the
road
to
anseremme
and
bought
some
of
the
gingerbread
their
had
told
them
to
buy
they
ate
it
next
day
with
no
particular
approval
on
the
final
stage
of
their
journey
in
a
train
that
puffed
and
pottered
between
heights
and
orchards
in
the
winding
company
of
a
stream
it
puffed
and
pottered
them
at
last
to
their
wayside
a
smiling
and
loutish
country
boy
slouched
up
to
take
possession
of
them
and
their
modest
baggage
they
understood
not
a
word
of
his
patois
but
knew
from
information
imparted
beforehand
by
madame
amberg
that
this
was
their
housekeeper
s
grandson
and
deputed
to
serve
as
their
guide
he
gripped
a
bag
easily
in
either
hand
and
led
the
way
past
the
few
small
houses
ranged
neatly
as
a
miniature
village
alongside
the
miniature
so
by
the
white
road
that
kept
the
river
company
after
a
mile
or
thereabout
they
left
the
white
road
turning
sharply
to
the
right
at
a
cleft
in
the
riverside
cliff
and
striking
a
scarcely
more
than
a
path
into
a
valley
twisted
back
among
the
hills
it
was
a
valley
the
like
of
which
they
had
never
seen
which
the
world
seemed
to
have
forgotten
a
cool
green
vision
of
summer
and
solitary
peace
water
had
cleft
in
the
above
them
a
passage
that
time
had
made
leafy
and
gracious
and
laid
aside
for
their
finding
through
the
flat
lush
pastures
that
divided
the
bold
slopes
there
looped
and
tangled
a
tiny
brook
on
its
way
to
the
meuse
and
the
sea
a
winding
ribbon
of
shadow
of
shimmer
and
reflection
up
the
slopes
rising
steeply
from
the
pastures
there
clustered
tree
above
thickly
set
that
where
the
valley
dwindled
in
the
distance
they
might
have
been
moss
on
the
there
was
no
one
in
sight
and
no
sound
but
their
footsteps
and
the
birds
it
was
all
a
green
prettiness
given
over
to
birds
and
themselves
isn
t
it
wonderful
griselda
said
not
knowing
that
her
voice
had
dropped
and
lost
its
shrillness
i
never
thought
there
could
be
such
a
place
she
spoke
the
truth
if
in
hackneyed
and
unthinking
phrase
in
her
busy
and
crowded
little
mind
the
reflection
of
her
busy
little
life
there
had
been
no
room
for
visions
of
a
deep
and
solitary
peace
involuntarily
as
they
walked
they
drew
nearer
together
and
went
closely
side
by
side
the
sweet
aloofness
of
the
valley
not
only
amazed
them
it
awed
them
they
were
dimly
conscious
of
being
in
contact
with
something
which
in
its
silent
gracious
way
was
disquieting
as
well
as
beautiful
their
theory
and
practice
of
life
so
far
was
the
theory
and
practice
of
their
purely
urban
environment
of
crowds
committees
and
grievances
and
cocksure
little
people
like
lo
out
of
an
atmosphere
of
cocksureness
and
hustle
they
had
stepped
as
it
seemed
without
warning
into
one
of
mystery
and
the
endless
patience
of
the
earth
out
here
in
this
strange
overpowering
peace
it
was
difficult
to
be
conscious
of
grievances
political
or
ethical
instead
came
a
new
undefined
and
uneasy
sense
of
personal
inadequacy
and
shrinkage
a
sense
of
the
unknown
and
hitherto
a
fear
of
something
undreamed
of
in
their
rabid
and
philosophy
not
that
they
reasoned
after
this
fashion
or
were
capable
of
analysing
the
source
of
the
tremor
that
mingled
with
their
physical
pleasure
their
sheer
delight
of
the
eye
but
before
they
had
been
in
the
valley
many
hours
they
sympathized
in
secret
they
did
not
know
why
with
madame
amberg
s
consistent
avoidance
of
its
loveliness
saw
hazily
and
without
comprehension
why
for
all
her
praise
of
its
beauties
she
was
so
loth
to
dwell
there
the
place
though
they
knew
it
not
was
a
new
idea
to
therefore
a
shadow
of
terror
to
their
patterned
and
settled
convictions
as
such
their
organized
and
regulated
minds
shrank
from
it
at
once
and
apprehensive
lest
the
new
idea
should
tamper
with
accepted
beliefs
disturb
established
views
and
call
generally
for
the
exercise
of
faculties
hitherto
unused
they
had
an
uneasy
mentioned
aloud
by
either
though
troublous
to
long
contact
with
solitude
and
beauty
might
end
by
confusing
issues
that
once
were
plain
and
so
unfitting
them
for
the
work
of
progress
and
committees
agitations
the
absorbing
of
pamphlets
and
the
general
duty
of
rearranging
the
universe
there
was
something
probably
in
the
frame
of
mind
in
which
they
approached
the
valley
they
came
of
a
migratory
holiday
race
and
had
seen
green
beauty
before
if
only
fleetingly
and
at
intervals
what
they
had
lacked
before
was
the
insight
into
beauty
born
of
their
own
hearts
content
the
wonder
created
by
their
own
most
happy
love
they
followed
their
guide
for
the
most
part
in
silence
relieved
that
he
had
ceased
his
attempts
to
make
them
understand
his
jargon
and
speaking
when
they
spoke
at
all
in
voices
lowered
almost
to
a
whisper
what
s
that
griselda
queried
still
under
her
breath
that
was
a
flash
of
blue
fire
ahead
of
them
darting
slantwise
over
the
stream
later
they
learned
to
understand
that
a
flash
of
blue
fire
meant
kingfisher
but
for
the
moment
william
shook
his
head
nonplussed
and
hazarded
only
it
s
a
bird
for
or
so
it
was
only
the
birds
and
themselves
then
at
a
turn
in
the
narrowing
valley
they
came
in
sight
of
cows
nuzzling
the
pastures
several
cows
black
and
white
like
the
cows
of
a
noah
s
ark
and
further
on
a
tiny
farm
house
standing
close
up
to
the
trees
in
its
patch
of
vegetable
garden
they
knew
from
madame
amberg
of
the
existence
of
the
tiny
farmhouse
it
was
an
old
woman
living
there
who
would
do
for
them
during
their
stay
at
the
neighbouring
and
clean
and
make
tidy
in
return
for
a
moderate
wage
the
barking
of
a
kennelled
nondescript
brought
the
old
woman
shuffling
to
the
welcome
them
presumably
in
her
native
tongue
and
to
take
their
measure
from
head
to
heel
with
a
pair
of
shrewd
sunken
eyes
of
her
verbal
greetings
they
understood
nothing
but
the
mention
of
madame
amberg
but
having
looked
them
up
and
down
enough
the
old
lady
shuffled
back
into
her
kitchen
for
the
key
of
the
revolutionist
s
property
she
reappeared
with
the
key
in
one
hand
and
a
copper
stewpan
in
the
she
waved
the
signal
to
advance
and
shuffled
off
in
guidance
ahead
of
her
grandson
and
the
visitors
a
quarter
of
an
hour
s
more
walking
on
a
dwindling
path
brought
them
in
sight
of
their
sylvan
honeymoon
abode
it
had
originally
been
built
for
the
use
of
a
woodman
and
was
a
cottage
on
the
edge
of
the
wood
overlooking
the
stream
and
the
pasture
of
the
cows
madame
peys
they
knew
at
least
her
name
unlocked
the
door
and
ushered
them
into
the
kitchen
where
the
boy
deposited
their
bags
the
cottage
was
what
any
one
who
know
madame
amberg
might
have
expected
her
cottage
to
be
it
was
sparsely
furnished
except
with
explosive
literature
there
were
very
few
chairs
and
those
few
verging
on
decrepitude
but
numerous
tracts
and
pamphlets
in
divers
civilized
languages
kitchen
utensils
were
conspicuous
chiefly
by
their
absence
and
presumably
the
owner
relied
consistently
on
the
loan
of
the
copper
stewpan
which
had
accompanied
her
guests
from
the
farm
on
the
other
hand
the
kitchen
walls
were
adorned
by
photographs
more
or
less
of
various
political
extremists
and
a
signed
presentment
of
rosa
luxemburg
adorned
a
bedroom
mantelpiece
while
madame
peys
made
play
with
the
and
a
kettle
the
honeymoon
couple
unpacked
their
bags
and
examined
their
new
domain
still
to
a
certain
extent
overawed
by
the
silence
and
loneliness
around
it
still
unknown
to
themselves
speaking
more
gently
and
with
more
hesitation
than
usual
it
was
the
familiar
tang
of
the
books
and
pamphlets
with
which
the
shelves
were
crammed
and
the
floor
was
heaped
that
first
revived
their
quieted
spirits
and
created
a
sense
of
home
woman
and
democracy
even
on
the
backs
of
books
had
power
to
act
as
a
tonic
and
to
reflect
the
atmosphere
of
noise
and
controversy
where
alone
they
could
breathe
with
comfort
with
unconscious
relief
they
turned
from
the
window
and
the
prospect
of
the
valley
green
and
untenanted
to
entrench
themselves
against
the
assaults
of
the
unknown
behind
the
friendly
and
familiar
volumes
that
had
overflowed
from
madame
amberg
s
deal
to
madame
amberg
s
uncarpeted
floor
conning
them
handling
them
and
turning
their
pages
they
were
again
on
the
solid
ground
of
impatient
intolerance
they
were
back
amongst
their
own
their
cherished
certainties
william
in
the
presence
of
belfort
bax
felt
his
feet
once
more
beneath
him
griselda
recognizing
a
pamphlet
by
christabel
pankhurst
ceased
to
be
troubled
by
the
loneliness
around
her
grew
animated
and
raised
her
voice
and
the
savoury
mess
which
madame
produced
from
her
stewpan
combined
with
the
no
less
excellent
coffee
that
followed
dispelled
for
the
moment
the
sense
of
mystery
and
the
shadow
of
the
new
idea
the
shadow
obtruded
itself
more
than
once
during
the
next
three
weeks
or
so
but
on
the
whole
they
managed
with
fair
success
to
be
in
the
country
and
not
of
create
in
the
heart
of
their
immemorial
valley
a
little
refuge
and
atmosphere
of
truly
advanced
suburbia
their
existence
in
the
ardennes
valley
was
one
of
mutual
affection
and
which
latter
term
they
understood
principally
the
reading
of
books
they
agreed
with
from
the
cares
and
worries
of
housekeeping
they
were
blissfully
and
entirely
free
madame
peys
did
their
catering
taking
toll
no
doubt
of
their
simplicity
and
ignorance
of
french
but
taking
it
with
tact
and
discretion
her
bills
were
a
weekly
trouble
to
griselda
but
not
on
account
of
their
length
what
she
disliked
was
the
embarrassing
moment
when
she
strove
to
conceal
her
complete
ignorance
of
the
items
and
difficulty
in
grasping
the
total
as
set
forth
in
ciphers
their
tidying
was
also
done
daily
and
adequately
their
cooking
more
than
adequately
madame
peys
called
them
in
the
morning
set
the
house
to
rights
and
their
various
meals
going
and
looked
in
at
intervals
during
the
day
departing
for
the
last
time
when
supper
was
cooked
and
laid
their
daily
doings
fell
naturally
into
routine
they
rose
of
a
morning
to
coffee
steaming
on
the
stove
and
having
digested
their
breakfast
they
usually
proceeded
to
walk
a
little
concluding
the
exercise
by
sitting
under
the
trees
with
a
book
which
william
read
aloud
to
griselda
they
lunched
sometimes
in
picnic
fashion
sometimes
at
home
in
the
afternoon
took
another
stroll
or
sat
at
home
reading
with
happy
little
interludes
of
talk
on
two
or
three
days
they
made
small
excursions
to
one
of
the
neighbouring
villages
on
others
william
with
a
pen
and
a
frown
of
importance
would
establish
himself
at
the
table
after
lunch
was
cleared
away
he
had
a
tract
in
hand
on
the
woman
question
and
griselda
gently
but
firmly
insisted
that
even
in
the
first
ecstasy
of
their
honeymoon
he
should
not
lay
it
aside
having
a
due
sense
of
the
value
of
his
work
he
did
not
require
much
pressing
and
while
he
frowned
and
scribbled
and
frowned
and
paused
she
would
sit
by
reading
and
now
and
again
glance
up
that
she
might
meet
his
eye
and
smile
long
afterwards
months
afterwards
when
he
had
forgotten
the
work
and
all
he
had
meant
to
prove
by
it
he
would
remember
how
she
had
risen
and
come
behind
him
smoothing
and
fondling
his
ruffled
hair
and
bending
over
to
kiss
him
he
would
drop
his
pen
and
lift
his
face
to
hers
sometimes
in
silence
and
sometimes
murmuring
foolishness
in
time
as
the
peaceful
days
crept
by
they
were
sorry
that
yielding
to
a
romantic
impulse
they
had
directed
that
neither
paper
nor
letter
should
be
forwarded
during
their
absence
as
a
result
of
this
prohibition
their
entire
correspondence
while
they
stayed
in
the
valley
consisted
of
one
despatched
by
madame
amberg
from
liverpool
at
the
moment
of
her
embarkation
for
an
extended
lecture
tour
in
the
states
it
was
sent
three
days
after
their
wedding
and
expressed
exuberant
affection
but
was
singularly
lacking
in
news
of
the
outside
world
to
remove
the
prohibition
would
be
to
confess
failure
and
suggest
boredom
therefore
neither
ventured
to
hint
at
it
all
the
same
they
knew
in
their
secret
hearts
that
they
had
overrated
their
resourcefulness
it
was
not
that
they
palled
on
each
from
it
but
part
at
least
of
their
mutual
attraction
was
their
mutual
interest
in
certain
subjects
and
limited
phases
of
activity
madame
amberg
s
revolutionary
library
valuable
as
it
was
in
distracting
their
thoughts
from
the
silence
and
beauty
around
them
and
defending
them
against
the
unknown
could
not
entirely
supply
the
place
of
daily
whirl
and
unceasing
snarl
and
argument
william
pined
unconsciously
for
the
din
and
dust
of
the
platform
and
griselda
missed
the
weekly
temper
into
which
she
worked
herself
in
sympathy
with
her
weekly
she
missed
it
so
much
that
at
last
she
was
moved
to
on
a
still
heavy
evening
in
august
when
once
or
twice
there
had
come
up
the
valley
a
distant
mutter
as
of
thunder
dear
she
said
gently
as
they
sat
by
the
window
after
supper
i
don
t
know
how
you
feel
about
it
but
i
am
beginning
to
think
that
our
life
here
is
almost
too
peaceful
it
is
beautiful
to
sit
here
together
and
dream
and
forget
the
is
it
a
preparation
for
the
life
we
are
to
lead
is
it
a
preparation
for
our
work
william
sighed
a
gentle
sigh
of
relief
and
his
hand
went
out
to
his
wife
s
in
a
squeeze
of
agreement
and
gratitude
as
usual
their
minds
had
jumped
together
and
the
thought
of
twain
had
been
uttered
by
the
lips
of
one
i
ve
been
thinking
the
same
thing
myself
he
said
it
has
struck
me
more
than
once
as
you
say
it
s
beautiful
here
in
the
heart
of
the
could
be
more
beautiful
but
i
have
wondered
especially
lately
if
it
isn
t
enervating
it
is
good
for
some
people
perhaps
but
when
you
have
an
aim
in
life
and
the
fighting
spirit
in
yes
griselda
flared
responsively
it
s
the
fighting
the
cause
calling
to
us
i
ve
been
hearing
the
call
getting
louder
and
louder
we
can
t
stand
aside
any
longer
we
haven
t
the
right
to
stand
aside
how
can
dare
and
enjoy
myself
when
there
are
noble
women
struggling
for
freedom
suffering
for
freedom
keeping
the
flag
and
the
unconscious
little
humbug
clasped
her
hands
and
from
force
of
habit
rose
to
her
feet
addressing
an
imaginary
audience
william
an
equally
unconscious
humbug
also
rose
to
his
feet
and
kissed
her
it
was
one
of
those
happy
and
moments
in
which
inclination
agrees
with
duty
and
they
were
able
to
admire
themselves
and
each
other
for
a
sacrifice
which
had
cost
them
nothing
the
decision
taken
there
remained
only
the
details
of
their
speedy
departure
to
settle
their
first
impatient
impulse
was
to
leave
for
brussels
on
the
morrow
but
on
consideration
they
decided
that
the
morrow
would
be
too
soon
investigation
of
a
local
revealed
the
fact
that
the
connection
with
only
tolerable
a
start
in
the
very
early
morning
but
an
early
start
meant
an
overnight
warning
to
the
philippe
that
his
services
would
be
needful
to
carry
their
bags
to
the
the
all
of
them
went
to
bed
soon
after
the
sun
and
were
certainly
by
now
asleep
there
was
further
the
old
lady
to
settle
with
where
financial
matters
were
concerned
and
it
always
took
time
to
make
out
her
illegible
bill
on
reflection
therefore
they
decided
for
the
following
day
i
hope
griselda
meditated
that
i
shall
be
able
to
make
madame
peys
understand
that
we
want
the
boy
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
i
expect
she
will
see
what
i
mean
if
i
show
her
the
train
in
the
and
say
philippe
and
point
to
the
bags
that
ought
to
make
it
clear
it
rather
detracts
from
the
enjoyment
of
being
being
able
to
make
people
understand
what
you
say
interlaken
was
much
more
convenient
in
that
way
all
the
waiters
spoke
english
quite
nicely
and
the
understanding
is
even
more
difficult
than
the
speaking
madame
was
talking
away
hard
to
me
all
the
time
she
was
cooking
our
supper
but
i
couldn
t
make
out
one
word
she
that
she
was
very
excited
i
said
oui
oui
every
now
and
then
because
she
seemed
to
expect
it
and
i
was
sorry
to
see
her
upset
i
thought
perhaps
one
of
the
people
at
the
farm
was
ill
but
i
ve
seen
her
son
and
his
wife
and
the
boy
since
so
it
can
t
be
that
of
course
she
may
have
other
relations
in
some
other
part
of
the
perhaps
something
has
happened
to
one
of
the
cows
i
could
see
she
was
worried
they
sat
until
late
side
by
side
by
the
open
window
and
talked
in
snatches
of
the
world
they
were
going
back
dear
familiar
world
of
the
agitated
and
advanced
its
dust
was
already
in
their
nostrils
its
clamour
already
in
their
ears
in
three
days
more
they
would
be
in
it
once
again
with
their
own
little
turbulent
folk
the
mere
thought
increased
their
sense
of
their
own
value
and
they
grew
gay
and
excited
as
they
talked
and
planned
instinctively
turning
their
backs
on
the
window
and
shutting
out
sight
and
sound
of
the
country
peace
the
oppressive
peace
in
which
they
had
no
part
what
shall
we
do
darling
griselda
asked
at
length
the
question
was
prompted
by
her
longing
for
to
be
over
and
her
mind
was
in
search
of
some
method
for
inducing
it
to
pass
with
swiftness
they
considered
the
point
with
that
object
in
view
and
decided
that
should
the
day
prove
fine
they
would
spend
it
away
from
the
cottage
taking
their
lunch
with
them
there
was
a
winding
path
leading
up
through
the
woods
to
the
heights
which
they
had
not
yet
explored
except
for
a
short
distance
they
would
start
out
provisioned
soon
after
breakfast
to
go
where
the
path
led
them
and
eat
their
meal
on
the
then
home
to
supper
settlement
with
madame
and
an
early
departure
next
morning
so
they
planned
comfortably
and
without
misgiving
while
the
world
seethed
in
the
and
the
kaiser
battered
at
liège
if
it
s
fine
william
cautioned
again
as
they
mounted
the
stairs
to
bed
i
ve
heard
thunder
several
times
in
the
distance
so
we
may
have
a
storm
in
the
morning
there
was
no
storm
or
sign
of
a
storm
in
the
morning
it
must
have
passed
over
griselda
said
she
had
listened
to
its
faint
and
distant
mutterings
for
before
she
fell
asleep
their
meal
of
coffee
and
eggs
was
waiting
on
the
stove
as
usual
and
madame
peys
had
vanished
as
usual
before
they
came
down
to
partake
of
it
they
more
eggs
while
they
breakfasted
and
the
meal
disposed
of
set
to
work
to
cut
plentiful
sandwiches
and
otherwise
furnish
their
basket
as
their
road
up
the
hill
did
not
lead
them
past
the
farm
and
madame
peys
had
not
yet
put
in
an
appearance
for
the
process
of
tidying
up
william
inscribed
in
large
on
an
envelope
the
word
as
a
sign
to
their
housekeeper
that
the
preparation
of
a
midday
meal
was
unnecessary
and
having
placed
the
announcement
on
the
kitchen
table
duly
weighted
with
a
saucer
he
took
the
basket
on
one
arm
his
wife
on
the
other
and
set
out
they
met
not
a
soul
that
morning
as
they
mounted
the
winding
little
slowly
for
the
winding
little
path
was
not
only
longer
than
they
had
expected
but
very
steep
in
places
further
the
day
was
hot
even
under
the
trees
and
they
rested
more
than
once
before
they
reached
their
goal
the
heights
that
crowned
the
valley
rested
with
their
backs
against
a
and
talked
of
themselves
and
what
interested
meetings
past
and
to
come
of
the
treachery
of
the
labour
party
of
the
wickedness
of
the
government
and
the
necessity
for
terrifying
its
members
by
new
and
astounding
tactics
the
idea
had
been
to
lunch
when
the
heights
above
them
were
gained
but
the
weight
of
the
basket
made
itself
felt
in
the
heat
and
they
were
still
some
distance
from
their
goal
when
they
decided
it
was
time
to
lighten
it
they
did
so
in
the
customary
fashion
ate
well
and
heartily
and
although
they
allowed
an
unhurried
interval
for
digestion
were
even
less
enthusiastic
about
their
uphill
walk
than
they
had
been
before
partaking
of
lunch
it
was
a
relief
to
them
when
at
last
they
emerged
from
the
trees
and
found
themselves
high
above
the
valley
and
entering
on
a
wide
stretch
of
upland
the
wide
stretch
of
upland
had
no
particular
attraction
but
it
denoted
the
limits
of
their
excursion
and
a
consequent
return
downhill
don
t
you
think
we
ve
about
been
far
enough
griselda
suggested
there
s
rather
a
glare
now
we
re
out
of
the
wood
and
it
s
not
particularly
pretty
here
william
agreed
however
as
a
rider
that
a
rest
was
desirable
before
they
started
homeward
and
that
if
they
went
as
far
as
the
rise
in
the
ground
a
hundred
yards
to
their
right
they
would
probably
have
quite
a
good
view
and
he
expected
there
would
be
a
nice
breeze
in
accordance
with
these
expectations
they
mounted
the
knoll
found
the
breeze
and
the
view
they
expected
and
subsided
in
the
shade
of
a
bush
if
they
had
but
known
it
they
were
the
last
tourists
of
their
race
who
for
many
and
many
a
day
to
come
were
to
look
on
the
scene
before
them
had
they
but
known
it
they
would
certainly
have
scanned
it
more
keenly
as
it
was
they
surveyed
the
wide
landscape
contentedly
but
with
no
particular
enthusiasm
on
every
side
of
them
were
the
rounded
gently
swelling
and
cleft
here
and
there
by
wooded
valleys
on
their
right
was
the
deep
cleft
from
which
they
had
mounted
through
the
woods
and
before
them
the
ground
dropped
sharply
to
the
edge
of
a
cliff
the
boundary
of
a
wider
cleft
running
at
right
angles
to
their
own
green
valley
of
silence
it
was
along
this
wider
cleft
that
the
railway
ran
the
little
branch
line
that
so
they
thought
was
to
take
them
on
the
first
stage
of
their
journey
from
their
perch
on
the
they
could
see
the
three
ribbons
of
dark
track
white
road
and
shadowed
river
which
between
them
filled
the
valley
the
wall
of
rock
jutted
forward
on
their
left
hiding
as
they
knew
the
wayside
railway
station
at
which
they
had
arrived
and
the
cluster
of
neat
houses
beside
it
to
the
right
again
there
was
a
bend
no
less
between
the
two
a
stretch
of
empty
road
it
s
very
pretty
said
griselda
yawning
and
fanning
herself
but
i
wish
it
wasn
t
quite
so
hot
i
suppose
there
s
nothing
left
to
drink
william
was
sorry
there
wasn
had
finished
the
last
drop
at
lunch
griselda
sighed
stretched
herself
out
on
her
elbow
with
her
face
towards
the
eastern
bluff
and
saw
coming
round
it
a
group
of
three
or
four
horses
carrying
little
toy
men
past
trees
that
looked
like
bushes
they
were
moving
quickly
the
horses
were
cantering
on
the
white
ribbon
of
road
griselda
pointed
them
out
to
william
and
the
pair
leaned
forward
to
watch
them
pass
hundreds
of
feet
below
they
re
scampering
along
she
said
they
must
be
in
a
hurry
what
funny
little
things
they
look
from
insects
they
ll
be
out
of
sight
in
a
they
ve
stopped
i
believe
they
re
turning
back
the
funny
little
things
had
halted
simultaneously
at
the
foot
of
the
jutting
cliff
which
hid
the
village
and
the
station
from
the
eyes
of
william
and
griselda
as
griselda
had
said
in
another
moment
they
would
have
been
round
it
and
out
of
sight
and
fifty
more
yards
or
so
beyond
the
bend
would
have
brought
them
to
the
outskirts
of
the
village
instead
they
halted
and
drew
together
for
an
instant
then
one
funny
little
thing
detaching
himself
from
the
group
scampered
backwards
by
the
road
he
had
come
and
continued
scampering
till
he
rounded
the
eastward
bluff
his
insects
of
companions
remained
grouped
where
he
had
left
them
their
horses
shifting
backwards
and
forwards
on
the
white
surface
of
the
road
they
re
waiting
for
him
to
come
back
griselda
concluded
idly
i
expect
they
ve
forgotten
something
what
they
had
forgotten
proved
to
be
a
column
of
horsemen
curving
in
swift
and
orderly
fashion
round
the
foot
of
the
eastward
bluff
it
came
on
a
supple
and
decorative
line
bending
with
the
bend
and
straightening
as
the
valley
straightened
soldiers
said
william
with
the
orthodox
accent
of
with
a
pleasure
he
would
not
for
worlds
have
admitted
the
sinuous
windings
of
the
troop
there
is
in
the
orderly
movement
of
men
an
attraction
which
few
can
resist
it
appealed
even
to
his
elementary
sense
of
the
rhythmic
and
he
like
griselda
bent
forward
to
watch
and
to
listen
to
the
distant
clatter
of
hoofs
echoed
back
from
the
walls
of
the
valley
as
the
horsemen
swung
out
of
sight
round
the
westward
bluff
and
the
clatter
of
deadened
he
held
up
a
finger
and
griselda
asked
what
is
it
guns
he
said
t
you
hear
them
she
did
a
soft
not
unpleasing
thud
repeated
again
and
again
and
coming
down
the
breeze
from
the
northward
it
must
be
manoeuvres
he
explained
that
s
what
those
soldiers
are
doing
i
expect
it
s
what
they
call
the
autumn
manoeuvres
playing
at
murder
griselda
commented
producing
the
orthodox
sigh
she
had
heard
the
phrase
used
by
a
pacifist
orator
in
the
park
and
considered
it
apt
and
telling
what
a
waste
of
what
a
brutalizing
influence
on
the
soldiers
themselves
ah
if
only
women
had
a
say
in
national
affairs
and
she
made
the
customary
glib
oration
on
her
loved
and
familiar
text
before
it
was
quite
finished
william
held
up
his
finger
for
griselda
had
stopped
short
on
her
own
initiative
this
time
it
was
a
crackle
of
sharp
little
shots
not
far
away
and
softened
like
the
sound
of
the
heavier
guns
but
comparatively
close
at
hand
and
if
their
ears
did
not
deceive
them
just
beyond
the
westward
bluff
they
re
pretending
to
fight
in
the
village
griselda
said
how
silly
firing
off
guns
and
making
believe
to
shoot
people
militarism
william
assented
is
always
silly
and
he
in
his
turn
enlarged
on
his
favourite
text
the
impossibility
of
international
warfare
owing
to
the
solidarity
of
the
european
little
homily
being
punctuated
here
and
there
by
a
further
crackle
from
below
when
he
had
enlarged
sufficiently
and
griselda
had
duly
agreed
he
returned
as
it
were
to
private
life
and
suggested
if
you
re
feeling
more
rested
shall
we
make
a
start
it
s
cooler
under
the
trees
they
started
accordingly
on
their
homeward
way
which
was
even
longer
than
the
route
they
had
taken
in
the
morning
one
little
wood
path
was
very
like
another
and
they
managed
to
take
a
wrong
turning
bear
too
much
to
the
right
and
make
a
considerable
detour
when
the
cottage
came
in
sight
they
were
both
thirsty
and
secretly
relieved
that
their
last
excursion
was
over
we
ll
put
on
the
and
have
some
tea
griselda
announced
as
they
pushed
open
the
door
oh
dear
it
s
lovely
to
think
we
shall
be
in
london
so
soon
how
i
would
love
a
strawberry
ice
where
s
the
it
was
not
until
the
was
found
and
the
kindled
that
william
discovered
on
the
kitchen
table
a
mystery
in
the
shape
of
a
document
it
was
an
unimposing
looking
document
not
over
clean
indicted
in
pencil
on
the
reverse
of
the
of
paper
on
which
william
that
morning
had
written
his
announcement
of
like
william
s
announcement
the
communication
was
in
french
of
a
uneducated
french
if
one
judged
by
the
writing
and
like
william
the
author
of
the
communication
in
all
likelihood
madame
peys
had
placed
it
in
the
centre
of
the
table
and
crowned
it
with
a
saucer
before
leaving
i
suppose
it
must
be
for
us
william
remarked
doubtfully
i
can
t
make
out
a
word
of
you
of
course
not
griselda
returned
with
a
spice
of
was
tired
and
her
boots
hurt
her
i
couldn
t
read
that
ridiculous
writing
if
it
was
english
it
s
that
silly
old
woman
madame
peys
i
suppose
but
what
is
the
good
of
her
writing
us
letters
when
she
knows
we
can
t
read
them
perhaps
william
suggested
it
s
to
say
she
won
t
be
able
to
cook
our
supper
very
likely
his
wife
agreed
the
spice
of
irritation
still
more
pronounced
if
that
s
it
we
shall
have
to
do
with
used
up
the
cold
meat
for
sandwiches
at
lunch
and
there
s
nothing
else
in
the
house
we
d
better
go
round
to
the
farm
when
we
ve
had
our
tea
and
find
out
what
she
old
thing
whether
she
comes
here
or
not
we
must
see
her
to
get
the
bill
and
order
the
boy
for
the
morning
but
i
don
t
mean
to
move
another
step
till
i
ve
had
my
tea
they
had
their
tea
griselda
with
her
boots
off
and
her
aching
feet
resting
on
a
chair
and
after
she
had
lapped
up
two
comfortable
cups
her
irritation
subsided
and
she
was
once
again
her
pleasant
and
chattering
little
self
william
to
give
her
a
further
rest
volunteered
though
with
some
hesitation
to
make
the
visit
to
the
farm
alone
in
his
mind
as
in
her
own
griselda
was
the
french
scholar
of
the
pair
a
reputation
due
to
the
fact
that
it
was
she
to
whom
madame
peys
preferred
as
a
rule
to
address
her
unintelligible
remarks
griselda
knew
what
the
offer
cost
him
and
generously
declined
to
take
advantage
of
only
for
a
few
minutes
more
repose
before
encasing
her
weary
feet
again
in
boots
the
few
minutes
drew
out
into
or
more
and
the
shadows
were
lengthening
in
the
valley
when
they
started
on
their
walk
to
the
farm
they
started
the
wife
leaning
on
the
husband
but
when
they
came
in
sight
of
the
house
griselda
took
her
arm
from
william
s
and
they
drew
a
little
apart
they
need
not
have
troubled
to
observe
the
minor
proprieties
not
a
soul
stirred
not
a
nose
showed
itself
as
they
opened
the
little
wooden
gate
of
the
garden
and
made
for
the
open
door
they
were
both
of
them
unobservant
of
country
sights
and
sounds
and
it
was
not
until
they
had
knocked
in
vain
on
the
open
door
and
called
in
vain
on
the
name
of
madame
peys
that
they
were
struck
by
the
absence
of
the
usual
noises
of
the
farm
there
was
neither
lowing
of
cows
nor
crowing
and
clucking
of
poultry
and
the
nondescript
of
a
dog
who
usually
heralded
the
approach
of
a
visitor
by
strangling
tugs
at
his
chain
and
vociferous
canine
curses
for
once
had
allowed
their
advent
to
pass
unchallenged
they
realized
suddenly
that
there
was
a
strange
silence
from
the
kennel
and
turned
simultaneously
to
look
at
it
it
s
odd
said
william
i
suppose
they
ve
all
gone
out
and
taken
the
dog
with
them
where
are
the
cocks
and
hens
said
griselda
suddenly
as
if
in
answer
to
her
query
a
scraggy
pullet
at
the
awkward
age
appeared
on
the
top
of
the
farmyard
gate
flapped
groundwards
and
proceeded
to
investigate
the
neighbouring
soil
with
a
series
of
businesslike
pecks
their
eyes
turned
towards
the
yard
whence
the
pullet
had
emerged
in
search
of
her
usual
bevy
of
feathered
companions
but
the
satisfied
cluck
of
the
bird
as
she
sampled
a
seed
remained
unechoed
and
unanswered
and
brought
no
comrade
to
the
spot
obviously
the
family
excursion
was
unlikely
to
be
accompanied
by
a
lengthy
procession
of
poultry
and
moved
by
a
common
impulse
of
wonder
william
and
griselda
made
for
the
gate
and
surveyed
the
farmyard
beyond
the
doors
of
byre
and
stable
were
standing
wide
untenanted
either
by
horse
or
by
cow
and
the
two
had
vanished
there
was
a
small
dark
square
in
the
corner
of
the
yard
marking
the
spot
where
yesterday
an
imprisoned
mother
had
kept
watch
and
ward
over
a
baker
s
dozen
of
attractive
yellow
downlings
now
the
dark
square
was
the
only
trace
of
mother
chicks
and
cell
i
wish
said
william
that
we
could
read
what
s
written
on
that
paper
what
can
have
happened
to
them
all
what
s
happened
to
them
is
that
they
ve
gone
griselda
returned
with
decision
and
gone
for
a
good
long
don
t
take
their
cows
and
chickens
and
with
them
when
they
go
for
a
i
suppose
they
re
moving
and
taking
another
farm
william
agreed
doubtfully
but
i
shouldn
t
have
thought
they
d
have
moved
at
such
short
all
those
animals
of
course
if
they
re
moving
they
ll
come
back
for
what
they
ve
spades
and
the
wheelbarrow
and
the
furniture
there
are
a
lot
of
things
still
in
the
kitchen
they
may
come
to
fetch
them
they
re
sure
to
his
wife
said
hopefully
besides
madame
peys
would
never
leave
us
without
milk
or
provisions
for
the
s
much
too
considerate
i
daresay
the
new
farm
isn
t
far
off
and
she
ll
either
come
herself
or
send
philippe
then
we
must
explain
about
the
train
morning
william
still
doubtful
in
spite
of
griselda
s
optimism
paused
at
the
door
of
the
kitchen
pushed
it
more
widely
ajar
and
surveyed
the
interior
in
detail
they
must
have
started
in
rather
a
hurry
he
commented
the
comment
was
justified
by
the
disordered
appearance
of
the
room
suggesting
a
departure
anything
but
leisurely
and
packing
anything
but
methodical
there
was
an
upturned
by
the
hearth
where
the
ashes
of
the
wood
fire
still
glowed
and
reddened
in
places
but
all
the
other
chairs
had
vanished
the
heavy
table
was
still
in
the
centre
of
the
room
but
a
smaller
one
had
gone
and
several
pans
were
missing
from
the
row
that
shimmered
on
the
wall
opposite
the
fireplace
the
canary
s
cage
and
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
had
departed
and
the
china
cupboard
standing
wide
open
was
rifled
of
part
of
its
a
random
selection
on
the
floor
in
one
corner
was
a
large
chequered
knotted
into
a
bundle
and
containing
judging
by
its
bulges
a
collection
of
domestic
objects
of
every
shape
known
to
the
housewife
it
lay
discarded
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
like
a
bursting
and
badly
cooked
pudding
its
formidable
size
and
unwieldy
contour
accounting
in
themselves
for
the
household
s
decision
to
abandon
it
there
was
about
the
in
all
dismantled
or
partially
dismantled
indefinite
suggestion
of
melancholy
william
and
griselda
were
conscious
of
its
influence
as
they
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
kitchen
which
they
had
hitherto
known
only
as
a
model
of
orderly
arrangement
i
wonder
how
long
they
will
be
griselda
said
as
she
and
her
husband
came
out
into
the
dying
sunlight
it
isn
t
any
good
hanging
about
here
if
nobody
has
turned
up
we
can
stroll
down
again
after
supper
i
wonder
if
i
could
make
an
ve
often
watched
her
do
it
and
it
doesn
t
seem
so
very
difficult
how
lonely
that
chicken
looks
poking
about
by
itself
her
eye
followed
the
gawky
pullet
as
it
clucked
and
pecked
in
its
loneliness
about
the
vegetable
suddenly
her
hand
shot
out
and
caught
at
her
husband
s
arm
william
she
said
in
a
queer
little
whisper
what
s
that
what
william
queried
by
the
clutch
and
the
whisper
don
t
you
see
heap
beyond
the
gooseberry
bushes
he
looked
where
she
pointed
and
she
felt
him
thrill
as
she
herself
had
thrilled
when
her
hand
went
out
to
his
arm
neither
spoke
as
they
went
towards
the
end
of
the
garden
instinctively
hushing
their
footsteps
the
soft
earth
beyond
the
gooseberry
bushes
had
been
heaped
into
a
long
mound
and
the
solitary
pullet
was
clucking
and
pecking
at
the
side
of
a
grave
they
stood
looking
down
at
it
in
and
uneasily
fearful
in
the
presence
of
a
mystery
beyond
their
powers
of
fathoming
the
empty
untidy
house
behind
them
was
suddenly
a
threat
and
a
shadow
so
was
the
loneliness
and
silence
of
the
valley
the
damp
garden
earth
was
still
fresh
and
black
from
its
turning
whoever
lay
under
it
could
have
lain
but
an
hour
or
two
and
lest
the
unmistakable
shape
of
the
mound
should
fail
to
indicate
what
it
covered
some
one
had
laid
on
it
a
red
spray
torn
from
a
and
with
a
stick
and
a
knot
of
string
had
fashioned
a
cross
for
the
head
two
crossed
hazel
shoots
and
a
handful
of
roses
betokened
that
a
spirit
had
returned
to
the
god
who
gave
it
as
they
stood
at
the
graveside
in
the
peace
of
the
evening
the
constant
mutter
of
distant
guns
sent
a
threat
along
the
valley
but
they
were
too
much
engrossed
in
their
thoughts
and
surroundings
to
give
it
ear
or
heed
and
it
was
the
pullet
who
roused
them
from
their
stupor
of
dumb
astonishment
encouraged
by
their
stillness
she
drew
near
surveyed
the
mound
and
with
a
flap
of
her
clipped
wings
alighted
under
the
cross
william
instinctively
bent
forward
to
shoo
her
away
and
as
she
fled
protesting
to
a
safer
neighbourhood
the
husband
and
wife
for
the
first
time
moved
and
spoke
what
can
have
happened
griselda
whispered
do
you
william
you
don
t
think
there
has
been
a
murder
william
shook
his
head
though
not
with
excess
of
confidence
there
s
the
cross
he
objected
and
the
roses
a
murderer
would
hardly
put
i
don
t
know
griselda
whispered
back
you
hear
of
criminals
doing
such
strange
perhaps
it
was
done
hastily
in
a
quarrel
and
the
murderer
repented
at
once
for
all
we
know
that
paper
on
our
kitchen
table
may
be
a
confession
i
wonder
whose
grave
it
it
s
one
of
the
peys
it
s
so
odd
their
all
having
must
be
something
wrong
you
don
t
suppose
they
ve
gone
off
to
hide
themselves
william
reminded
her
of
the
absence
of
the
she
admitted
that
a
family
seeking
to
elude
justice
would
hardly
be
so
foolish
as
to
attempt
to
conceal
itself
from
the
police
in
the
company
of
seven
cows
two
and
an
entire
colony
of
poultry
nor
when
untrodden
woods
lay
around
them
would
they
call
attention
to
the
crime
by
placing
the
grave
of
their
victim
in
a
prominent
position
in
the
garden
while
it
was
difficult
to
think
of
the
peys
family
as
they
had
known
them
as
murderers
and
accomplices
of
murderers
the
old
lady
so
cheery
and
shrewd
her
son
and
his
wife
so
unintelligibly
friendly
and
philippe
so
loutishly
for
a
while
a
gruesome
fascination
held
them
to
the
side
of
the
then
griselda
quivered
and
said
suddenly
let
s
go
home
they
walked
away
softly
and
closed
the
gate
softly
behind
them
and
once
they
were
well
beyond
it
instinctively
quickened
their
footsteps
they
walked
speaking
little
on
their
way
back
to
the
cottage
and
it
was
not
until
they
were
almost
on
the
threshold
of
their
solitary
homestead
that
it
struck
them
that
perhaps
they
would
only
be
fulfilling
their
legal
duty
by
informing
the
local
authorities
of
the
presence
of
the
grave
they
discussed
the
idea
considered
it
and
after
discussion
rejected
it
for
one
thing
there
was
the
language
difficulty
for
another
the
natural
shrinking
of
the
foreigner
from
entangling
himself
in
unknown
processes
of
possible
detention
for
the
purpose
of
giving
evidence
they
decided
that
it
would
be
better
for
the
present
to
await
events
and
hope
for
the
return
of
some
member
of
the
vanished
family
in
after
days
when
after
events
had
given
him
a
clue
william
framed
his
solution
to
the
mystery
of
the
grave
and
the
empty
solution
which
perhaps
was
not
correct
as
to
detail
but
was
certainly
right
in
substance
some
fleeing
belgian
wounded
to
death
had
found
strength
to
outrun
or
outride
the
uhlan
and
seeking
a
refuge
in
the
hidden
valley
had
brought
his
news
to
the
farmhouse
and
died
after
giving
it
utterance
those
who
heard
it
had
buried
him
in
haste
and
straightway
fled
from
the
clumsily
with
horse
and
cart
and
cattle
leaving
their
scribbled
unreadable
warning
to
the
absent
tenants
of
the
cottage
whether
they
fled
far
and
successfully
or
whether
they
were
overtaken
and
in
due
course
held
fast
behind
the
barrier
of
flesh
and
iron
that
shut
off
the
german
and
his
conquests
from
the
rest
of
the
civilized
william
and
griselda
never
knew
in
the
meantime
unfurnished
with
any
clue
unknowing
of
the
wild
fury
that
in
its
scathing
of
the
civilized
world
was
shattering
their
most
cherished
illusions
they
sought
in
vain
for
an
explanation
putting
the
fact
into
the
lamp
earlier
than
usual
and
took
care
to
bolt
the
door
usually
it
was
fastened
only
on
the
latch
so
that
madame
could
let
herself
in
with
the
early
morning
but
the
darkness
was
unfriendly
and
the
lonely
valley
held
they
knew
not
what
of
threatening
griselda
uneasily
pondering
on
other
matters
had
no
mind
to
give
to
the
experiment
of
an
omelette
and
their
supper
was
plain
boiled
hard
while
she
sat
with
wrinkled
brow
unheeding
of
the
flight
of
minutes
while
they
supped
their
ears
were
always
on
the
alert
for
a
footstep
or
a
hail
from
without
and
perhaps
for
that
reason
they
noticed
as
they
had
never
noticed
before
the
faint
ghostly
noises
of
the
bird
and
the
shiver
of
leaves
when
the
air
stirred
and
sighed
they
talked
with
effort
and
frequent
pause
and
with
now
and
again
a
glance
thrown
sideways
at
the
open
window
and
the
forest
blackness
behind
it
there
were
no
blinds
to
the
windows
and
but
for
the
still
heavy
heat
they
would
have
fastened
the
shutters
and
barred
out
the
forest
blackness
perhaps
they
would
have
borne
with
the
heat
of
a
closed
room
had
not
both
been
ashamed
to
confess
their
fear
of
the
window
in
both
their
minds
was
the
sense
of
being
very
far
removed
from
humanity
the
knowledge
that
between
them
and
humanity
was
a
lonely
path
and
a
house
with
its
doors
set
house
deserted
and
half
dismantled
with
a
nameless
grave
before
it
unimaginative
as
they
both
were
they
pictured
the
grave
in
the
darkness
with
its
roughly
tied
cross
and
its
handful
of
wilting
rosebuds
they
went
upstairs
earlier
than
usual
chiefly
because
they
felt
more
comfortable
when
the
windows
below
were
fastened
william
coming
last
with
the
candle
took
the
added
precaution
of
turning
the
key
in
the
door
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
griselda
though
she
made
no
remark
heard
the
click
of
the
lock
with
a
secret
throb
of
relief
upstairs
they
began
by
a
little
pretence
of
then
griselda
with
her
hair
down
her
back
sat
close
to
william
with
his
coat
off
and
they
held
hands
and
talked
in
undertones
in
the
intervals
of
listening
for
a
footstep
the
footstep
never
came
but
it
was
not
until
close
upon
midnight
the
early
habits
of
the
former
tenants
of
the
gave
up
all
hope
of
hearing
it
and
began
to
discuss
their
plans
for
the
following
day
on
the
presumption
that
they
must
leave
the
cottage
and
remove
their
luggage
alone
such
unaided
removal
meant
an
earlier
uprising
than
they
had
counted
if
madame
did
not
prepare
their
breakfast
they
needs
must
prepare
it
themselves
and
this
misfortune
realized
they
decided
to
sit
up
no
longer
they
went
to
bed
but
left
the
candle
they
said
to
each
other
lest
one
of
the
peys
family
should
knock
them
up
during
the
night
neither
slept
much
partly
from
nervous
uneasiness
and
partly
from
fear
of
oversleeping
but
if
they
had
guessed
what
a
day
would
bring
forth
neither
would
have
slept
at
all
they
had
left
their
bedroom
windows
uncurtained
that
the
morning
light
might
waken
them
and
they
were
hardly
later
than
the
august
sun
in
opening
their
eyes
on
the
world
though
they
had
slept
but
little
and
by
snatches
they
turned
out
of
bed
without
regret
the
flood
of
sunlight
brought
warmth
into
their
hearts
and
the
shadowy
horror
of
the
night
before
was
lifted
with
the
mists
of
the
valley
but
all
the
same
the
place
once
only
faintly
mysterious
was
now
actively
malicious
and
distasteful
was
tainted
with
a
lurking
dread
thus
to
their
pleasure
at
the
thought
of
noise
and
london
was
added
relief
at
the
prospect
of
escape
from
a
solitude
grown
fearful
since
yesterday
they
dressed
with
haste
and
rising
spirits
and
it
was
with
undisguised
joy
that
they
collected
their
few
possessions
and
stuffed
them
into
their
william
whose
toilet
and
preparations
for
the
journey
were
completed
in
advance
of
his
wife
s
descended
first
to
the
kitchen
where
in
the
continued
and
regretted
absence
of
their
housekeeper
he
struggled
valiantly
with
the
making
of
breakfast
while
griselda
finished
her
packing
the
meal
so
prepared
fell
short
of
complete
success
coffee
as
brewed
by
william
was
not
the
same
beverage
as
coffee
prepared
by
madame
peys
nor
were
its
tepid
attractions
enhanced
by
the
absence
of
their
usual
and
plentiful
ration
of
milk
thanks
to
the
defection
of
the
peys
family
they
were
not
only
milkless
but
eggless
and
such
remains
of
bread
and
butter
as
they
could
find
in
the
cupboard
were
the
only
accompaniment
to
william
s
suggestion
of
coffee
in
the
circumstances
there
was
but
little
temptation
to
risk
the
loss
of
the
brussels
train
by
lingering
over
the
table
and
less
than
five
minutes
sufficed
for
their
simple
meal
having
despatched
it
they
strapped
their
and
stepped
out
briskly
on
their
way
to
the
station
and
sun
still
low
on
the
eastward
ridge
of
the
valley
and
the
dew
still
heavy
on
the
grass
they
hardly
turned
to
look
back
at
the
cottage
so
glad
were
they
to
leave
it
behind
them
and
in
the
elation
of
their
spirits
they
sped
down
the
path
with
a
quite
unnecessary
haste
they
were
escaping
from
nature
and
solitude
and
their
hearts
sang
cheerily
of
bloomsbury
when
they
rounded
the
bend
in
the
path
that
brought
them
within
sight
of
the
farm
their
first
thought
was
that
the
missing
family
had
returned
for
outside
the
gate
were
three
horses
standing
riderless
and
with
heads
near
together
there
was
something
reassuring
in
the
sight
of
the
beasts
as
they
stood
in
the
sunlight
shifting
and
flicking
their
tails
something
that
gave
the
lie
to
the
terrors
of
the
night
before
the
presence
of
horses
betokened
the
presence
of
men
and
the
presence
of
men
dissipated
the
sense
of
mystery
that
had
brooded
over
an
empty
house
with
a
nameless
grave
in
its
garden
griselda
drew
a
comfortable
breath
of
relief
as
she
supposed
they
had
time
to
call
in
and
settle
the
last
week
s
bill
with
madame
peys
i
do
wish
she
pondered
regretfully
that
i
could
understand
what
she
says
i
must
say
i
should
like
to
know
what
the
explanation
that
grave
i
suppose
they
ve
come
back
to
fetch
away
the
rest
of
the
furniture
and
aren
t
their
horses
though
no
william
assented
considering
the
sleek
strong
beasts
they
have
only
got
i
wonder
a
man
stepped
suddenly
out
from
behind
the
shifting
suddenly
that
they
both
started
he
had
been
standing
by
the
gate
with
the
bridles
gathered
in
his
hand
hidden
by
his
charges
from
william
and
griselda
as
they
had
been
hidden
from
him
when
hearing
their
voices
he
stepped
into
sight
he
stood
with
his
heels
together
very
erect
and
staring
at
young
man
squarely
and
sturdily
built
with
under
his
helmet
a
reddish
face
and
a
budding
black
moustache
he
was
clad
in
a
greyish
uniform
and
a
sword
hung
by
his
side
he
stared
and
the
pair
stared
back
at
but
not
quite
so
openly
it
s
a
soldier
griselda
like
william
i
they
both
wondered
so
much
that
they
hesitated
and
slackened
their
pace
the
presence
of
a
military
man
but
complicated
the
problem
of
the
farm
coupled
with
the
absence
of
the
peys
family
it
revived
their
suspicions
of
the
night
before
their
suspicions
of
crime
and
a
hasty
flight
from
justice
and
involuntarily
their
eyes
turned
to
the
garden
and
sought
the
outline
of
the
grave
beyond
the
gooseberry
bushes
it
really
does
look
griselda
whispered
as
if
there
was
right
as
she
whispered
the
soldier
rapped
out
a
loud
monosyllable
it
was
enunciated
so
curtly
and
sharply
that
they
started
for
the
second
time
and
came
to
an
involuntary
halt
for
the
space
of
a
second
or
two
they
stood
and
then
griselda
recovering
from
the
shock
expressed
her
indignant
opinion
how
rude
she
said
what
does
he
shout
at
us
like
that
for
i
suppose
her
husband
conjectured
he
wants
us
to
stop
well
said
griselda
we
have
stopped
her
tone
was
nettled
and
embittered
it
annoyed
her
to
realize
that
involuntarily
and
instinctively
she
had
obeyed
an
official
order
it
was
not
she
felt
what
her
leaders
would
expect
from
a
woman
of
her
training
and
calibre
it
was
that
and
not
fear
that
disconcerted
after
the
first
shock
of
surprise
at
the
man
s
rough
manner
neither
she
nor
her
husband
were
in
the
least
overawed
on
the
contrary
as
they
stood
side
by
side
with
their
baggage
in
their
hands
gazing
into
the
sunburnt
face
of
the
soldier
something
of
the
contempt
they
felt
for
his
species
was
reflected
in
their
eyes
of
the
two
pairs
of
eyes
william
s
perhaps
were
the
more
contemptuous
his
was
more
habitual
and
ingrained
than
griselda
s
what
william
looked
at
was
a
creature
the
soldier
of
whom
he
knew
little
and
talked
much
his
experience
of
the
man
of
war
was
purely
insular
and
his
attitude
towards
him
would
have
been
impossible
in
any
but
a
native
of
britain
he
came
of
a
english
lower
the
rules
of
caste
and
tradition
of
centuries
debarred
from
the
bearing
of
arms
a
class
which
might
in
this
connection
have
adapted
to
its
own
needs
the
motto
of
the
house
of
rohan
roi
ne
puis
prince
ne
daigne
rohan
je
suis
might
have
been
suitably
englished
in
the
mouths
of
william
s
fellows
as
officer
i
can
not
be
private
i
will
not
be
tradesman
or
clerk
i
am
further
he
had
lived
in
surroundings
where
the
soldier
was
robbed
of
his
terrors
to
him
the
wearer
of
the
king
s
uniform
was
not
only
a
person
to
whom
you
alluded
at
labour
meetings
with
the
certainty
of
raising
a
jeer
but
a
target
at
whom
strikers
threw
brickbats
and
bottles
with
energy
and
practical
impunity
should
the
target
grow
restive
under
these
attentions
and
proceed
to
return
them
in
kind
it
was
denounced
in
parliament
foamed
at
by
the
press
and
possibly
as
a
sop
to
indignant
labour
thus
handicapped
it
could
hardly
be
looked
on
as
a
formidable
adversary
and
william
without
a
thought
of
fear
stared
the
horseman
in
the
eyes
the
horseman
on
his
side
stared
the
pair
of
civilians
up
and
a
glance
that
matched
the
courtesy
of
his
recent
manner
of
having
surveyed
them
sufficiently
he
called
over
his
shoulder
to
some
one
unseen
within
the
house
there
was
something
in
his
face
and
the
tone
of
his
hail
that
made
the
temper
of
griselda
stir
within
her
and
for
the
second
time
that
morning
she
wished
for
a
command
of
the
language
of
the
time
for
the
purposes
of
sharp
and
scathing
rebuke
as
a
substitute
she
assumed
the
air
of
cold
dignity
with
which
she
had
entered
the
taxi
on
the
night
of
her
protest
at
the
meeting
come
on
william
she
said
don
t
take
any
notice
of
him
dear
the
advice
though
well
meant
was
unfortunate
as
william
attempted
to
follow
both
it
and
his
wife
the
soldier
moved
forward
and
struck
him
a
cuff
on
the
side
of
the
head
that
deposited
him
neatly
on
the
grass
griselda
order
to
convey
her
contempt
for
official
authority
and
disgust
at
official
been
pointedly
surveying
the
meeting
of
hill
and
horizon
heard
a
whack
and
scuffle
a
guttural
grunt
and
a
gasp
and
turned
to
see
william
with
a
hand
to
his
cheek
lying
prone
at
the
feet
of
his
assailant
she
rounded
on
the
man
like
a
lion
and
perhaps
with
her
suffragette
training
behind
her
would
have
landed
him
a
cuff
in
his
turn
but
as
she
raised
her
arm
it
was
caught
from
behind
and
she
found
herself
suddenly
helpless
in
the
grasp
of
a
second
when
he
heard
his
comrade
s
hail
had
come
running
out
of
the
house
let
me
go
she
cried
wriggling
in
his
grasp
as
she
had
wriggled
aforetime
in
the
hands
of
a
london
policeman
and
kicking
him
deftly
on
the
shins
as
she
had
been
wont
to
kick
robert
on
his
for
answer
he
shook
her
to
the
accompaniment
of
what
sounded
like
her
vehemently
till
her
hat
came
off
and
her
hair
fell
down
till
her
teeth
rattled
and
the
landscape
danced
about
her
when
he
released
her
with
the
final
indignity
of
a
butt
with
the
knee
in
the
rear
she
collapsed
on
the
grass
by
her
husband
s
side
in
a
crumpled
disreputable
heap
there
for
a
minute
or
two
she
lay
gasping
and
as
her
breath
came
back
and
the
landscape
ceased
to
gyrate
she
dragged
herself
up
into
a
sitting
position
and
thrust
back
the
hair
from
her
eyes
william
a
yard
or
two
away
was
also
in
a
sitting
position
with
his
hand
pressed
against
his
cheekbone
while
over
him
stood
the
assailants
in
apparently
snapping
out
questions
i
don
t
understand
she
heard
him
protest
feebly
i
tell
you
i
don
t
understand
griselda
can
t
you
explain
to
them
that
i
don
t
speak
french
comprends
pas
said
griselda
swallowing
back
tears
of
rage
comprends
it
s
not
a
bit
of
good
your
talking
to
us
parlez
pas
that
won
t
prevent
me
from
reporting
you
for
this
disgraceful
assault
you
abominable
cowards
you
re
worse
than
the
police
at
home
which
is
saying
a
good
deal
i
wonder
you
re
not
ashamed
of
yourselves
i
ve
been
arrested
three
times
and
i
ve
never
been
treated
like
this
at
this
juncture
one
of
the
men
in
seized
william
by
the
collar
and
proceeded
to
turn
out
his
from
their
recesses
a
purse
a
pipe
a
handkerchief
a
fountain
pen
and
a
cook
s
ticket
he
snapped
back
the
elastic
on
the
cook
s
ticket
and
turned
the
leaves
that
remained
for
the
journey
home
london
he
ejaculated
suddenly
pronouncing
the
vowels
in
fashion
as
o
s
london
his
companion
echoed
then
as
if
moved
by
a
common
impulse
they
called
on
the
name
of
heinz
there
was
an
answering
hail
from
the
farmhouse
kitchen
whence
issued
promptly
a
fattish
young
man
with
a
mug
in
his
hand
and
a
helmet
tilted
on
his
nose
with
him
the
assailants
of
william
and
griselda
entered
into
rapid
and
throaty
explanations
whereat
heinz
nodded
assentingly
as
he
advanced
down
the
garden
path
to
the
gate
surveying
the
captives
with
interest
and
a
pair
of
little
pigs
having
reached
the
gate
he
leaned
over
it
mug
in
hand
and
looked
down
at
william
and
griselda
english
he
said
in
a
voice
that
was
thicker
than
it
should
have
been
at
so
early
an
hour
of
the
morning
come
from
london
i
have
been
two
years
in
london
that
is
why
i
speak
english
i
was
with
a
hairdresser
in
the
harrow
road
two
years
and
i
know
also
the
strand
and
the
angel
and
buckingham
palace
and
the
elephant
he
was
plainly
proud
of
his
acquaintance
with
london
topography
all
of
them
i
know
and
when
we
arrive
in
london
i
shall
show
them
all
to
my
friends
he
waved
his
hand
vaguely
and
amiably
to
indicate
his
companions
you
come
from
london
but
you
shall
not
go
back
there
because
you
are
now
our
prisoners
i
drink
your
damn
bad
health
and
the
damn
bad
health
of
your
country
and
the
damn
bad
health
of
your
king
he
suited
the
action
to
the
word
and
drained
his
mug
and
having
drained
it
till
it
stood
upright
upon
his
nose
proceeded
to
throw
it
over
his
shoulder
to
shatter
on
the
brick
path
whether
from
natural
good
temper
or
the
cheering
effect
of
potations
his
face
was
wreathed
in
an
amiable
smile
as
he
crossed
his
arms
on
the
bar
of
the
gate
and
continued
to
address
his
we
shall
take
you
to
our
officer
and
you
will
be
prisoners
and
if
you
are
spies
you
will
be
shot
there
was
something
so
impossible
about
the
announcement
that
william
and
griselda
felt
their
courage
return
with
a
rush
moreover
though
the
words
of
heinz
were
threatening
the
aspect
of
heinz
was
not
his
fat
young
face
with
its
expansive
and
slightly
inebriated
smile
was
ridiculous
rather
than
terrifying
even
under
the
brim
of
a
helmet
william
thankful
for
the
english
acquired
during
the
two
years
hairdressing
in
the
harrow
road
admonished
him
with
a
firmness
intended
to
sober
and
dismay
this
is
not
a
time
for
silly
jokes
i
am
afraid
that
you
do
not
realize
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
i
shall
feel
it
my
duty
to
make
a
full
report
to
your
you
will
find
it
is
no
laughing
matter
my
wife
and
i
proceeding
quietly
to
the
station
have
been
grossly
and
violently
assaulted
by
your
two
companions
we
gave
them
no
provocation
and
the
attack
was
entirely
uncalled
for
i
repeat
i
shall
feel
it
my
duty
to
report
their
conduct
in
the
very
strongest
terms
he
felt
as
he
spoke
that
the
reproof
would
have
carried
more
weight
had
it
been
delivered
in
a
standing
position
but
his
head
still
reeled
from
the
stinging
cuff
it
had
received
and
he
felt
safer
where
he
the
ground
it
annoyed
him
that
the
only
apparent
effect
of
his
words
upon
heinz
was
a
widening
of
his
already
wide
and
owlish
smile
oh
you
ll
report
their
conduct
will
you
he
repeated
pleasantly
and
thickly
and
who
will
you
report
it
to
old
son
william
stiffened
at
the
familiarity
and
the
tone
of
his
reply
was
even
colder
and
more
dignified
than
that
of
the
original
rebuke
to
the
nearest
police
authority
i
shall
not
leave
belgium
until
my
complaint
has
been
attended
to
if
necessary
i
shall
apply
for
redress
to
the
british
consul
in
brussels
the
expansive
smile
on
the
face
of
heinz
was
suddenly
ousted
by
an
expression
of
infinite
astonishment
his
fat
chin
dropped
his
little
eyes
widened
and
he
pushed
back
his
helmet
that
he
might
stare
the
better
at
william
say
it
again
he
and
as
if
doubtful
of
his
ears
you
shall
apply
to
the
british
british
consul
at
brussels
certainly
william
assured
him
firmly
and
griselda
echoed
certainly
the
threat
they
judged
had
made
the
desired
impression
for
so
blank
and
disturbed
was
the
countenance
of
heinz
that
his
two
companions
broke
into
guttural
questioning
the
former
hairdresser
checked
them
with
a
gesture
and
addressed
himself
once
more
to
william
i
think
he
announced
you
are
balmy
on
the
crumpet
both
of
you
balmy
he
repeated
staring
from
one
to
the
other
and
apparently
sobered
by
the
shock
of
his
own
astonishment
suddenly
a
gleam
of
intelligence
lit
up
his
little
pig
leaned
yet
further
over
the
gate
pointed
a
finger
and
you
do
not
read
the
newspapers
as
a
rule
i
do
william
informed
him
but
we
have
not
seen
any
since
we
left
england
and
how
long
is
it
since
you
left
england
william
told
him
it
was
over
three
weeks
three
weeks
the
other
repeated
three
weeks
without
newspapers
and
i
think
you
do
not
speak
french
eh
my
wife
william
answered
understands
little
but
we
neither
of
us
speak
it
his
manner
was
pardonably
irritated
and
if
he
had
not
judged
it
imprudent
he
would
have
refused
to
answer
this
purposeless
catechism
nor
was
his
pardonable
irritation
lessened
when
amusement
once
more
gained
the
upper
hand
in
heinz
suddenly
and
unaccountably
he
burst
into
hearty
and
trembled
with
it
holding
to
the
gate
and
wiping
the
tears
from
his
cheeks
whatever
the
joke
it
appealed
also
to
his
comrades
who
once
it
was
imparted
between
heinz
s
paroxysms
joined
their
exquisite
mirth
to
his
own
the
three
stood
swaying
in
noisy
merriment
while
griselda
whitefaced
and
and
william
with
a
fast
disappearing
left
eye
awaited
in
acute
and
indignant
discomfort
some
explanation
of
a
jest
that
struck
them
as
untimely
it
came
only
when
heinz
had
laughed
himself
out
wiping
the
tears
once
more
from
his
eyes
and
with
a
voice
still
weakened
by
pleasurable
emotion
he
gave
them
in
simple
and
unpolished
language
the
news
of
the
european
cataclysm
i
tell
you
something
you
damn
little
ignorant
silly
fools
there
is
a
war
since
you
came
to
belgium
probably
they
thought
it
was
a
drunken
jest
for
they
made
no
answer
beyond
a
stare
and
heinz
proceeded
with
enjoyment
a
war
the
greatest
that
ever
was
germany
and
russia
and
france
and
belgium
and
england
and
servia
he
spoke
slowly
dropping
out
his
words
that
none
might
fail
of
their
effect
and
ticked
off
on
a
finger
the
name
of
each
belligerent
our
brave
german
troops
have
conquered
belgium
and
that
is
why
we
are
here
we
shall
also
take
paris
and
we
shall
also
take
petersburg
and
we
shall
also
take
london
we
shall
march
through
regent
street
and
leicester
square
and
over
waterloo
bridge
our
kaiser
wilhelm
shall
make
peace
in
westminster
abbey
and
we
shall
take
away
all
your
colonies
what
do
you
think
of
that
you
damn
little
fools
there
are
statements
too
large
as
there
are
statements
too
wild
for
any
but
the
unusually
imaginative
to
grasp
at
a
first
hearing
neither
william
nor
griselda
had
ever
entertained
the
idea
of
a
european
war
it
was
not
entertained
by
any
of
their
friends
or
their
pamphlets
rumours
of
war
they
had
always
regarded
as
foolish
and
malicious
inventions
set
afloat
in
the
interest
of
capitalism
and
conservatism
with
the
object
of
diverting
attention
from
social
reform
or
the
settlement
of
the
woman
question
and
to
their
ears
still
filled
with
the
hum
of
other
days
the
announcement
of
heinz
was
even
such
a
foolish
invention
nor
even
had
they
given
him
credence
would
they
in
these
first
inexperienced
moments
have
been
greatly
perturbed
or
alarmed
their
historical
ignorance
was
so
profound
they
had
talked
so
long
and
so
often
in
terms
of
war
that
they
had
come
to
look
on
the
strife
of
nations
as
a
glorified
scuffle
on
the
lines
of
a
pankhurst
demonstration
thus
griselda
taught
by
used
the
one
word
battle
for
a
small
street
row
and
the
fire
and
slaughter
of
would
have
so
used
it
had
she
known
of
the
slaughter
of
eylau
and
that
being
the
case
heinz
s
revelation
of
ruin
and
thunder
left
her
so
i
think
she
said
loftily
in
answer
to
his
question
that
you
are
talking
absolute
nonsense
there
are
few
men
who
like
to
be
balked
of
a
sensation
and
heinz
was
not
among
them
he
reddened
with
annoyance
at
the
lack
of
success
of
his
bombshell
you
do
not
believe
it
he
said
you
do
not
believe
that
our
brave
german
troops
have
taken
belgium
and
will
shortly
take
paris
and
london
very
well
i
will
teach
you
i
will
show
you
you
shall
come
with
us
to
our
officer
and
you
shall
be
shot
for
spies
he
came
through
the
gate
and
clambered
into
his
saddle
his
companions
following
suit
william
and
griselda
instinctively
scrambled
to
their
feet
and
stood
gazing
up
in
uncertainty
at
the
three
grey
mounted
men
get
on
said
heinz
with
a
jerk
of
his
head
down
the
valley
and
as
william
and
griselda
still
stood
and
gazed
his
hand
went
clap
to
his
side
and
a
sword
flashed
out
of
its
sheath
griselda
shrieked
in
terror
as
it
flashed
over
william
s
william
bawled
and
writhed
with
pain
as
it
came
down
flat
on
his
shoulder
get
on
heinz
damn
you
and
the
blade
went
up
again
and
william
and
griselda
obeyed
him
without
further
hesitation
their
heads
were
whirling
and
their
hearts
throbbing
with
rage
but
they
choked
back
its
verbal
expression
and
stumbled
down
the
valley
the
clutch
of
brute
force
and
with
their
world
crumbling
about
them
it
was
a
most
unpleasant
rather
trot
they
were
bruised
they
were
aching
from
the
handling
they
had
received
and
their
breath
came
in
sobs
from
the
pace
they
were
forced
to
keep
up
did
they
slacken
it
even
for
an
instant
and
fall
level
with
the
walking
horses
heinz
shouted
an
order
to
hurry
you
swine
and
flashed
up
his
threatening
sword
whereupon
to
keep
out
of
its
painful
and
possibly
dangerous
reach
they
forced
themselves
to
a
further
effort
and
broke
into
a
shambling
canter
the
sweat
poured
off
them
as
they
shambled
and
gasped
casting
anxious
glances
at
the
horses
heads
behind
them
and
their
visible
distress
their
panting
and
their
impotent
anger
was
a
source
of
obvious
and
unrestrained
gratification
to
heinz
and
his
jovial
companions
they
jeered
at
the
captives
clumsy
running
and
urged
them
to
gallop
faster
when
griselda
tripped
over
a
tussock
and
sprawled
her
length
on
the
grass
they
applauded
her
downfall
long
and
joyously
and
begged
her
to
repeat
the
performance
the
jeers
hurt
more
than
the
shaking
and
she
staggered
to
her
feet
with
tears
of
wretchedness
and
outraged
dignity
running
openly
down
her
in
vain
for
that
sense
of
moral
superiority
and
satisfaction
in
martyrdom
which
had
always
sustained
her
en
route
to
the
cells
of
bow
street
she
hated
the
three
men
who
jeered
at
her
miseries
and
could
have
killed
them
with
pleasure
every
fibre
of
her
body
was
quivering
with
wrath
and
amazement
neither
she
nor
william
could
had
no
breath
left
in
them
to
speak
but
every
now
and
then
as
they
shambled
along
they
turned
their
hot
faces
to
look
at
each
saw
each
a
beloved
countenance
red
with
exertion
and
damp
with
perspiration
a
pair
of
bewildered
blue
eyes
and
a
gasping
open
mouth
so
they
trotted
down
the
valley
humiliated
dishevelled
indignant
but
still
their
world
crumbled
about
them
and
europe
thundered
and
bled
looking
back
on
the
morning
in
the
month
of
august
nineteen
hundred
and
fourteen
when
he
made
his
first
acquaintance
with
war
as
the
soldier
understands
it
william
tully
realized
that
fear
real
fear
was
absent
from
his
heart
until
he
witnessed
the
shooting
of
the
hostages
until
that
moment
he
had
been
unconvinced
and
because
unconvinced
unafraid
he
had
been
indignant
flustered
physically
sore
and
inconvenienced
but
always
at
the
back
of
his
mind
was
the
stubborn
belief
that
the
pains
and
indignities
endured
by
himself
and
his
wife
would
be
dearly
paid
for
by
the
perpetrators
he
could
conceive
as
yet
of
no
state
of
society
in
which
law
and
the
bodily
immunity
of
the
peaceful
citizen
was
not
the
ultimate
principle
and
even
the
sight
of
a
long
grey
battalion
of
infantry
plodding
dustily
westward
on
the
road
by
the
river
had
not
convinced
him
of
war
and
the
meaning
of
war
they
came
on
the
trudging
torrent
of
men
as
they
debouched
from
the
valley
on
to
the
main
road
and
their
captors
halted
them
on
the
grass
at
the
roadside
until
the
close
grey
ranks
had
passed
william
and
griselda
were
thankful
for
the
few
minutes
respite
and
they
wiped
their
hot
faces
and
griselda
made
ineffectual
attempts
to
tidy
her
tumbled
hair
she
was
reminded
by
her
pressing
need
of
hairpins
that
they
had
left
their
bags
on
the
scene
of
their
misfortune
outside
the
farmhouse
gate
they
conversed
about
the
loss
in
undertones
and
wondered
if
the
bags
would
be
recovered
they
were
not
without
hopes
taking
into
account
the
loneliness
of
the
neighbourhood
when
the
battalion
with
its
tail
of
attendant
grey
carts
had
passed
heinz
ordered
them
forward
they
moved
on
fifty
yards
or
so
behind
the
last
of
the
grey
carts
and
trusting
that
their
goal
was
at
hand
if
they
re
only
taking
us
as
far
as
the
village
griselda
panted
hopefully
they
the
familiar
little
village
with
its
miniature
railway
station
between
the
river
and
the
cliff
the
column
of
infantry
plodded
dustily
through
and
past
it
but
heinz
followed
the
only
halfway
down
the
street
before
he
shouted
to
his
prisoners
to
halt
they
an
alacrity
born
of
relief
and
a
sense
of
the
wisdom
of
prompt
obedience
to
an
unpretentious
white
building
with
a
sentry
stationed
on
either
side
of
the
door
heinz
swung
himself
down
from
his
horse
and
went
into
the
house
leaving
william
and
griselda
in
charge
of
his
comrades
and
standing
at
the
side
of
the
road
william
and
griselda
looked
about
them
they
had
passed
through
the
place
several
times
and
were
accustomed
enough
to
its
usual
appearance
to
be
aware
of
the
change
that
had
come
over
it
the
rumbling
grey
carts
behind
which
they
had
tramped
were
already
at
the
end
of
the
village
they
could
see
all
the
sunlit
length
of
the
street
and
take
stock
of
the
new
unfamiliar
life
which
filled
it
from
end
to
end
it
was
a
life
masculine
and
military
an
odd
mixture
of
iron
order
and
disorder
of
soldiers
on
duty
and
soldiers
taking
their
ease
the
street
itself
was
untidy
and
littered
as
they
had
never
seen
it
before
its
centre
had
been
swept
clear
so
that
traffic
might
pass
unhindered
but
the
sides
of
the
road
were
strewn
with
a
jetsam
of
fragmentary
lumber
a
country
cart
that
had
lost
a
wheel
sat
clumsily
in
front
of
the
church
near
a
jumble
of
broken
pottery
and
a
chair
with
its
legs
in
the
air
was
neighboured
by
trusses
of
straw
all
down
the
street
the
doors
stood
widely
and
there
a
house
with
starred
or
shattered
windows
looked
unkempt
and
forlornly
shabby
beyond
shivered
panes
and
occasional
litter
of
damaged
crockery
and
furniture
there
was
no
sign
of
actual
violence
the
encounter
that
had
taken
place
cavalry
skirmish
between
retreating
belgian
and
advancing
left
few
traces
behind
it
the
civilians
of
the
village
with
hardly
an
exception
were
invisible
the
landlord
of
the
café
was
serving
his
soldier
customers
and
two
labourers
were
unloading
sacks
from
a
miller
s
dray
under
the
eye
of
a
guard
and
when
william
and
griselda
had
been
waiting
for
a
few
minutes
an
old
man
crossed
the
road
hurriedly
from
opposite
house
to
from
shelter
like
a
rabbit
from
its
burrow
and
vanishing
with
a
swift
running
hobble
as
for
women
they
saw
only
they
were
not
to
forget
easily
they
stood
the
two
women
a
few
yards
away
on
the
further
side
of
the
road
almost
opposite
the
door
by
which
heinz
had
disappeared
and
with
their
eyes
continually
fixed
on
it
stout
and
very
neatly
dressed
in
black
with
a
black
woollen
scarf
on
her
shoulders
her
hands
were
folded
meeting
on
her
breast
and
every
now
and
then
she
bent
her
head
over
them
while
her
lips
moved
slowly
and
soundlessly
at
such
moments
she
closed
her
eyes
but
when
she
lifted
her
head
again
they
turned
steadily
to
the
door
the
woman
who
stood
beside
her
was
taller
and
younger
upright
and
angular
she
also
wore
a
black
dress
and
above
her
sharp
and
yellowish
features
an
unbecoming
black
hat
with
upstanding
and
rusty
black
bows
what
struck
you
about
her
at
the
first
glance
was
her
extreme
the
line
of
her
lean
shoulders
in
the
dowdily
conventional
hat
at
a
second
the
fact
that
her
mouth
was
a
line
so
tightly
were
her
lips
compressed
she
also
stood
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
door
william
and
griselda
looked
at
the
pair
curiously
it
was
odd
and
uncomfortable
to
see
them
standing
at
the
side
of
the
road
their
clothes
dusted
by
passing
cars
not
moving
or
speaking
to
each
other
for
the
rest
from
end
to
end
of
the
street
there
were
only
soldiers
in
sight
soldiers
taking
their
noisy
ease
at
the
tables
outside
the
number
of
them
crowded
round
the
little
green
tables
while
the
sweating
landlord
ran
to
and
fro
with
a
jug
or
a
tray
of
glasses
and
an
obvious
desire
to
propitiate
other
soldiers
less
noisy
led
a
string
of
horses
to
water
and
a
rigid
file
of
them
with
rifles
grounded
was
drawn
up
on
the
further
side
of
the
street
not
far
from
the
waiting
women
some
ten
or
a
dozen
of
motionless
helmeted
automata
with
a
young
officer
a
boy
pacing
up
and
down
the
road
in
front
of
them
through
a
gap
in
the
row
of
white
houses
william
and
griselda
saw
another
group
of
men
in
their
at
work
on
the
railway
line
that
should
have
taken
them
to
brussels
they
seemed
to
be
repairing
some
damage
to
the
permanent
way
and
further
down
the
village
two
or
three
soldier
mechanics
were
busied
inquisitively
at
the
bonnet
of
a
heavy
grey
car
drawn
up
at
the
side
of
the
road
while
they
waited
and
watched
other
heavy
grey
cars
of
the
same
pattern
rumbled
into
the
street
and
along
it
and
motor
cycles
one
after
another
hooted
and
clanked
past
them
to
vanish
in
a
smothering
trail
of
dust
in
after
days
william
tried
vainly
to
recall
what
he
felt
and
thought
in
the
long
hot
minutes
while
they
waited
for
heinz
to
reappear
and
for
something
to
happen
he
supposed
that
it
was
the
fiercer
sensations
of
the
time
that
followed
which
deadened
the
impressions
of
the
or
so
during
which
they
stood
in
the
sunny
street
expecting
they
knew
not
what
and
though
he
remembered
and
remembered
vividly
the
outward
show
and
manner
of
the
dusty
road
its
swarming
soldiers
its
passing
cars
and
cycles
and
the
bearing
of
the
two
silent
memory
brought
with
it
no
hint
of
his
accompanying
attitude
of
mind
all
he
knew
was
that
he
had
not
been
seriously
alarmed
he
might
have
recalled
his
impressions
with
more
success
had
he
and
griselda
discussed
at
the
time
their
new
and
surprising
experiences
but
an
attempt
to
enter
into
conversation
was
promptly
checked
by
one
of
their
attendant
guards
what
he
actually
said
was
unintelligible
but
his
manner
conveyed
his
meaning
and
thereafter
the
captives
considered
their
situation
in
silence
he
did
not
know
how
long
it
was
before
the
hostages
came
out
into
the
street
but
he
was
his
first
distinct
memory
of
a
vivid
personal
instantaneous
thrill
of
relief
and
excitement
with
which
after
their
dreary
wait
he
saw
the
first
signs
of
movement
at
the
door
a
out
swiftly
and
went
to
the
who
thereupon
stopped
his
pacing
there
was
a
clicking
of
heels
a
salute
and
a
message
rapidly
delivered
the
turned
and
shouted
to
his
men
and
his
men
moved
at
the
word
their
rifles
going
to
their
shoulders
as
if
by
the
impulse
of
one
will
william
s
eye
was
caught
and
held
by
the
oiled
swiftness
the
mechanical
simultaneousness
of
the
movement
he
stared
at
the
line
of
uniforms
now
rigidly
inactive
again
till
a
hand
from
behind
gripped
his
collar
and
impelled
him
urgently
sideways
one
of
his
captors
had
adopted
this
simple
method
of
informing
him
that
way
must
be
made
for
those
about
to
issue
from
the
door
of
the
house
he
choked
angrily
and
brought
up
against
the
which
griselda
taking
warning
had
hastily
backed
herself
he
was
still
gasping
when
the
little
procession
came
out
a
soldier
leading
it
a
couple
more
with
bayonets
civilians
walking
couple
more
soldiers
with
bayonets
fixed
and
last
of
all
an
officer
a
fattish
youngish
moustachioed
man
whom
the
sentries
stiffened
to
salute
he
came
a
little
behind
his
men
paused
on
the
step
and
stood
there
framed
in
the
doorway
with
his
hand
resting
on
his
sword
the
embodiment
of
conscious
authority
the
others
the
two
civilians
and
their
guard
went
on
to
the
middle
of
the
road
there
in
the
middle
of
the
road
they
also
soldiers
smartly
the
captives
william
saw
the
two
civilians
clearly
one
was
a
short
and
rotund
little
man
who
might
have
been
sixty
to
and
might
have
been
a
local
bald
and
with
drooping
moustaches
rather
like
a
stout
little
seal
essentially
an
ordinary
and
unpretentious
creature
he
was
obviously
aiming
at
dignity
his
chin
was
lifted
at
an
angle
that
revealed
the
measure
of
the
roll
of
fat
that
rested
on
his
collar
and
he
walked
almost
with
a
strut
as
if
he
were
attempting
to
march
afterwards
william
remembered
that
he
had
seen
on
the
little
man
s
portly
stomach
some
sort
of
insignia
or
ribbon
at
the
time
it
conveyed
nothing
to
him
but
he
was
told
later
that
it
was
the
outward
token
of
a
mayor
he
remembered
also
that
the
little
man
s
face
was
pale
with
a
sickly
pallor
and
that
as
he
came
down
the
steps
with
his
head
held
up
the
drooping
moustache
quivered
and
the
fat
chin
beneath
it
twitched
spasmodically
there
was
something
extraordinarily
pitiful
about
his
attempt
at
a
personal
dignity
which
nature
had
wholly
denied
him
william
felt
the
appeal
in
it
even
before
he
grasped
the
situation
the
meaning
and
need
of
the
pose
the
man
who
walked
on
his
left
hand
was
taller
and
some
years
slightly
stooping
and
with
slightly
grizzled
hair
and
beard
he
belonged
to
an
ordinary
sedentary
type
and
william
thinking
him
over
later
was
inclined
to
set
him
down
a
schoolmaster
or
perhaps
a
clerk
he
wore
and
his
black
coat
was
shiny
on
the
back
and
at
the
elbows
he
had
none
of
his
fellow
s
pomposity
and
walked
dragging
his
feet
and
with
his
eyes
bent
on
the
ground
he
raised
them
only
when
as
they
halted
in
the
middle
of
the
road
the
respectable
woman
in
black
called
out
word
perhaps
his
up
to
him
and
caught
him
by
the
shoulder
he
answered
her
quickly
and
very
hardly
more
than
a
for
a
second
or
two
after
he
had
spoken
she
stood
quite
still
with
her
hand
resting
on
his
shoulder
then
suddenly
her
sallow
face
contorted
her
thin
mouth
writhed
and
from
it
there
came
a
cry
that
was
too
fierce
to
be
called
a
groan
and
too
hoarse
to
be
called
a
scream
she
flung
herself
forward
on
the
neck
of
the
grizzled
man
and
her
lean
black
arms
went
round
it
he
tried
to
speak
to
her
again
but
she
silenced
him
by
drawing
down
his
head
to
her
breast
she
held
it
to
her
breast
and
pressed
it
there
she
rocked
and
swayed
a
little
from
side
to
side
fondling
the
grizzled
hair
and
kissing
it
to
a
stream
of
broken
endearment
her
grief
was
animal
alike
in
its
unrestraint
and
its
terrible
power
of
expression
convention
fell
away
from
her
in
her
tidy
dress
and
with
her
dowdy
hat
slipping
to
one
shoulder
she
was
primitive
woman
crooning
over
her
dying
mate
when
she
was
seized
and
drawn
away
from
her
man
her
curved
fingers
clung
to
his
garments
two
soldiers
held
her
and
she
writhed
between
them
choking
out
a
hoarse
incoherent
appeal
to
the
officer
standing
in
the
frame
of
the
doorway
with
his
hand
on
the
hilt
of
his
sword
she
went
on
crying
herself
hoarser
as
her
captors
urged
her
further
down
the
street
and
at
last
in
mercy
to
those
who
looked
on
out
of
sight
through
an
open
doorway
william
had
his
hands
to
his
ears
when
the
door
shut
no
one
in
spite
of
the
persistence
of
her
cries
came
out
into
the
street
to
inquire
the
cause
of
her
grief
but
it
seemed
to
william
afterwards
that
he
had
been
aware
here
and
there
of
furtive
faces
that
appeared
at
upper
windows
while
they
forced
the
dowdy
woman
away
from
him
her
man
stood
motionless
turned
away
from
her
with
his
head
bent
and
his
eyes
on
the
ground
so
that
he
started
when
a
soldier
came
up
behind
him
and
tapped
him
sharply
on
the
arm
the
had
stripes
on
his
sleeve
and
seemed
a
person
of
a
handkerchief
dangling
from
his
hand
and
seeing
it
the
captive
removed
his
eyeglasses
don
t
look
said
william
under
his
breath
griselda
don
t
look
for
the
first
time
mortal
fear
had
seized
him
by
the
throat
and
shaken
him
he
knew
now
that
he
stood
before
death
itself
and
the
power
to
inflict
death
and
his
heart
was
as
water
within
him
his
wife
was
beside
when
he
realized
as
he
did
later
on
with
shame
that
the
spasm
of
terror
in
those
first
moments
of
comprehension
had
been
stronger
than
the
spasm
of
pity
he
excused
it
by
the
fact
of
her
presence
his
fear
in
its
forecast
of
evil
took
tangible
shape
griselda
at
his
elbow
had
her
eyes
and
her
mouth
wide
open
she
was
engrossed
he
was
afraid
most
horribly
afraid
that
in
her
amazement
her
righteous
pity
she
might
say
or
do
something
that
would
bring
down
wrath
upon
them
he
remembered
how
bold
she
had
been
in
the
face
of
a
crowd
how
uplifted
by
sacred
enthusiasm
he
plucked
her
by
the
sleeve
when
he
whispered
to
her
not
to
she
went
on
staring
and
for
the
first
time
unresponsive
to
his
touch
and
the
sound
of
his
voice
they
bandaged
the
eyes
of
the
two
rotund
pompous
little
mayor
and
the
man
who
might
have
been
a
schoolmaster
all
his
life
william
remembered
the
look
of
the
rotund
mayor
with
a
bandage
covering
him
from
forehead
to
and
his
grey
moustache
quivering
beneath
man
most
pitifully
afraid
to
die
yet
striving
to
die
as
the
situation
demanded
and
he
remembered
how
at
the
moment
the
bandage
was
knotted
on
the
mayor
s
head
there
stepped
up
to
him
quietly
the
stout
old
woman
who
had
stood
praying
on
the
further
side
of
the
road
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
door
she
held
up
a
little
crucifix
and
pressed
it
to
the
quivering
grey
moustache
griselda
clutched
william
by
the
wrist
and
he
thought
she
was
going
to
cry
out
don
t
darling
don
t
he
whispered
oh
darling
for
both
our
sakes
he
did
not
know
whether
it
was
his
appeal
or
her
own
terror
and
amazement
that
restrained
her
from
she
stood
in
silence
with
her
fingers
tightened
on
his
wrist
he
wished
she
would
look
away
he
wished
he
could
look
away
himself
he
tried
for
an
instant
to
close
his
eyes
but
the
was
worse
than
sight
and
he
had
to
open
them
again
as
he
opened
them
a
car
roared
by
raising
a
smother
of
dust
but
as
the
cloud
of
its
passage
settled
he
saw
that
the
two
blindfolded
men
were
standing
with
their
backs
to
a
blank
garden
wall
with
the
boughs
of
a
drooping
over
it
it
was
opposite
the
wall
across
the
road
that
the
file
of
soldiers
was
drawn
up
the
captives
were
facing
the
muzzles
of
their
rifles
and
the
had
stationed
himself
stiffly
at
the
farther
end
of
the
file
the
dust
settled
and
died
there
followed
so
it
seemed
to
william
an
agony
of
waiting
for
something
that
would
not
happen
long
beating
seconds
three
or
four
of
them
at
most
while
two
men
stood
upright
with
bandaged
eyes
and
rifles
pointed
at
their
hearts
long
beating
seconds
while
a
bird
fluted
in
the
infinitely
careless
and
then
thank
god
for
it
a
voice
and
a
report
that
were
as
one
the
man
with
the
grizzled
hair
threw
out
an
arm
and
toppled
with
his
face
in
the
dust
the
mayor
slid
sideways
against
the
wall
with
the
blood
dribbling
from
his
mouth
fundamentally
william
was
no
more
of
a
coward
than
the
majority
of
his
and
put
to
it
he
would
have
emulated
the
shivering
little
mayor
and
tried
to
strut
gamely
to
his
end
it
was
as
much
sheer
bewildered
amazement
as
the
baseness
of
bodily
terror
that
had
him
by
the
throat
when
he
saw
the
hostages
done
to
and
shaking
him
and
for
the
moment
depriving
him
of
never
before
in
all
his
years
had
he
seen
a
man
come
to
his
end
so
far
death
had
touched
him
only
once
and
but
slightly
by
the
unseen
passing
of
a
mother
he
had
not
loved
thus
the
spectacle
of
violent
and
bloody
dying
would
of
itself
have
sufficed
to
unnerve
and
unman
him
to
the
natural
shrinking
from
that
spectacle
to
his
natural
horror
at
the
slaying
of
helpless
men
to
his
pity
and
physical
nausea
was
added
the
impotent
gasping
confusion
of
the
man
whose
faith
has
been
uprooted
who
is
face
to
face
with
the
incredible
before
his
eyes
had
been
enacted
the
ugly
and
brutal
beneath
his
feet
the
foundations
of
the
earth
were
reeling
the
guns
and
the
marching
columns
which
had
hitherto
passed
him
as
a
dusty
pageant
took
life
and
meaning
in
his
eyes
they
were
instruments
of
the
ugly
impossible
there
was
meaning
too
in
the
lonely
grave
and
in
the
lonely
men
had
fled
in
terror
of
such
scenes
as
his
eyes
had
witnessed
so
far
to
him
the
limit
of
human
savagery
had
been
the
feeding
through
the
nose
of
divers
young
women
who
infected
with
the
virus
of
martyrdom
demanded
to
be
left
to
now
he
had
witnessed
the
killing
of
men
who
desired
most
greatly
to
live
at
the
time
he
did
he
could
either
the
elements
of
the
situation
or
his
own
attitude
towards
it
but
he
knew
afterwards
vaguely
but
surely
that
in
that
one
bewildering
and
ruthless
moment
the
heart
of
his
faith
was
faith
in
that
large
vague
entity
the
people
in
the
power
of
public
opinion
and
talk
in
the
power
of
the
good
intention
until
that
moment
he
had
confounded
the
blunder
with
the
crime
the
mistaken
with
the
evilly
intentioned
it
had
not
seemed
to
him
possible
that
a
man
could
disagree
with
him
honestly
and
out
of
the
core
of
his
heart
it
had
not
seemed
to
him
possible
that
the
righteous
could
be
righteous
and
yet
err
he
knew
now
as
by
lightning
flash
that
he
faraday
a
thousand
others
throwing
scorn
from
a
thousand
platforms
on
the
idea
of
a
european
war
had
been
madly
wildly
ridiculously
the
knowledge
stunned
and
blinded
him
they
had
meant
so
well
they
had
meant
so
exceedingly
yet
they
had
prophesied
falsely
and
fact
had
given
them
the
lie
until
that
moment
he
had
been
in
what
he
called
politics
the
counterpart
of
the
christian
scientist
despising
and
denying
the
evil
that
now
laughed
triumphant
in
his
face
with
its
triumph
perforce
he
was
converted
war
was
men
were
shot
against
walls
converted
though
as
yet
he
knew
not
to
what
form
of
unknown
faith
he
did
not
see
what
became
of
the
two
dead
they
were
taken
or
by
whom
they
were
they
had
barely
fallen
to
the
ground
and
his
eyes
were
still
closed
that
he
might
not
look
on
the
blood
that
was
dribbling
from
the
mayor
s
moustache
when
a
hand
tapped
him
smartly
on
the
shoulder
and
he
found
heinz
standing
beside
him
he
had
a
glimpse
of
men
moving
round
the
bodies
a
glimpse
of
his
wife
s
face
staring
and
sickly
another
of
a
passing
and
then
heinz
turned
him
to
the
door
where
the
sentries
stood
on
guard
with
his
captor
s
hand
on
his
shoulder
he
went
into
the
low
white
house
along
a
little
passage
on
the
ground
floor
and
into
a
room
on
the
right
at
the
back
of
the
house
griselda
coming
after
him
still
staring
and
and
likewise
with
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
in
the
and
sunny
with
windows
looking
on
to
a
a
man
in
uniform
and
spectacles
writing
at
a
table
and
erect
and
complacent
beside
him
the
fattish
moustachioed
officer
who
had
watched
the
execution
from
the
doorstep
he
was
lighting
a
cigar
with
a
hand
that
did
not
tremble
william
and
griselda
were
escorted
by
their
guards
into
the
middle
of
the
room
and
planted
there
standing
in
front
of
him
after
what
he
had
seen
and
with
the
memory
of
heinz
s
threats
william
tully
believed
most
firmly
that
he
too
was
about
to
die
and
with
the
conviction
there
filled
his
heart
as
it
would
have
filled
the
heart
of
any
honest
lover
a
great
and
intolerable
pity
for
griselda
his
wife
she
the
woman
would
be
left
where
he
the
man
would
be
he
dared
not
turn
his
head
towards
her
lest
he
might
see
her
face
instinct
with
the
agony
of
the
coming
parting
lest
foreseeing
and
resisting
it
she
should
fling
her
arms
about
him
and
croon
over
him
as
the
woman
in
respectable
black
had
crooned
over
the
head
of
her
man
her
meanings
the
meanings
of
a
woman
unknown
had
torn
at
his
inmost
heart
how
should
he
bear
it
when
griselda
his
darling
clung
fast
to
him
and
cried
in
vain
for
pity
that
he
might
not
see
griselda
s
face
even
with
the
tail
of
an
eye
he
stared
hard
and
steadily
over
the
officer
s
shoulder
he
never
forgot
the
beyond
the
grey
uniform
it
was
dingy
mud
and
orange
as
to
ground
with
a
ponderous
pattern
of
clumped
and
climbing
vegetables
in
one
spot
opposite
the
window
where
a
blaze
of
sunlight
struck
it
the
mud
and
orange
was
transfigured
to
shining
william
knew
suddenly
that
he
had
never
seen
sunlight
before
for
the
first
time
he
saw
it
as
vivid
glory
from
his
eyes
as
he
thought
would
soon
close
on
its
splendour
for
ever
not
only
his
sight
but
his
every
sense
was
alert
and
most
sharply
intense
on
a
sudden
the
thudding
of
guns
in
the
distance
was
threateningly
nearer
at
hand
and
in
the
interval
between
the
a
wasp
beating
up
and
down
the
filled
the
room
with
a
spiteful
humming
it
was
while
he
stood
waiting
for
the
doom
he
believed
to
be
certain
while
the
german
captain
looked
him
up
and
down
and
addressed
curt
unintelligible
questions
to
those
who
had
made
him
their
there
stirred
in
the
breast
of
william
tully
the
first
faint
sense
of
nationality
he
did
not
recognize
it
as
such
and
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
he
should
since
his
life
for
the
last
few
strenuous
years
had
been
largely
moulded
on
the
principle
that
the
love
of
one
s
country
was
a
vice
to
be
combated
and
sneered
at
if
you
had
told
him
a
short
day
earlier
that
the
thought
of
the
soil
he
was
born
on
could
move
and
thrill
and
uplift
him
he
would
have
stared
and
despised
you
as
a
jingo
that
most
foolish
and
degraded
of
survivals
yet
with
his
eyes
as
he
thought
looking
their
last
on
the
blazing
gold
that
was
sunlight
with
the
sword
suspended
over
his
trembling
head
something
that
was
not
only
his
pitiful
love
for
griselda
something
that
was
more
than
his
decent
fluttered
and
stirred
within
him
and
called
on
him
to
play
the
man
it
bade
him
straighten
his
back
before
men
of
an
outlandish
race
it
bade
him
refrain
from
pleading
and
weakness
before
those
who
were
not
of
his
blood
and
for
the
first
time
for
many
years
he
thought
of
himself
as
a
national
a
man
of
the
english
race
not
consciously
as
yet
and
with
no
definite
sense
of
affection
for
england
or
impulse
to
stand
by
her
and
serve
her
but
with
a
vague
unreasoning
natural
longing
for
home
and
the
narrow
things
of
home
it
mattered
not
that
the
england
he
longed
for
was
small
suburban
crowded
and
noisily
pretentious
he
craved
for
it
in
the
face
of
death
as
other
men
crave
for
their
spacious
fenlands
or
the
sweep
of
their
open
downs
england
as
he
knew
her
called
him
not
with
the
noisy
call
of
yesterday
but
in
a
voice
less
strident
and
more
tender
he
knew
now
that
it
was
dreadful
to
die
away
from
her
instinctively
thinking
on
london
he
drew
himself
up
to
the
height
of
his
five
foot
five
the
mayor
had
done
before
lifted
his
chin
in
defiance
and
dignity
the
attempt
to
subdue
the
trembling
flesh
and
defy
brute
insolence
and
resemblance
between
the
two
men
s
cases
ended
for
the
time
being
william
ran
no
risk
of
a
violent
and
bloody
ending
there
was
no
further
need
of
an
example
and
he
had
offended
the
conqueror
only
by
his
poor
little
presence
he
expressed
his
enjoyment
of
it
less
noisily
and
emphatically
than
his
three
subordinates
had
humour
of
his
prisoner
s
situation
appealed
to
heinz
s
superior
officer
almost
as
much
as
it
had
appealed
to
heinz
himself
he
grinned
perceptibly
as
he
questioned
the
couple
in
his
somewhat
halting
english
chuckled
audibly
when
they
confirmed
his
subordinate
s
statement
as
to
their
complete
ignorance
of
the
european
upheaval
and
when
he
had
elicited
the
fact
that
the
hapless
pair
had
been
spending
their
honeymoon
in
the
secluded
valleys
of
ardennes
he
removed
his
cigar
from
his
moustachioed
lips
that
he
might
chuckle
long
and
unhindered
honeymoon
he
repeated
his
stout
shoulders
trembling
with
merriment
in
a
nice
quiet
place
wiz
no
one
to
interrupt
zee
kissings
never
will
have
a
very
good
honeymoon
with
us
and
you
will
very
soon
be
able
to
go
back
to
england
just
so
soon
as
the
sherman
army
shall
have
been
there
you
should
be
very
pleased
that
you
are
safe
with
us
it
is
more
dangerous
to
be
in
london
william
with
his
nerves
tuned
up
to
face
a
firing
party
withered
miserably
under
heavy
jocularity
he
knew
instinctively
that
his
life
was
saved
to
him
but
the
assurance
of
safety
was
conveyed
in
a
jeer
and
at
the
moment
so
oddly
are
we
made
the
jeer
hurt
more
than
the
assurance
of
safety
relieved
him
he
had
mastered
his
anguish
and
strung
himself
be
treated
as
a
figure
of
fun
the
spectacled
clerk
at
the
was
laughing
so
heartily
that
he
had
to
remove
his
glasses
and
wipe
them
before
he
continued
his
labours
william
tingled
all
over
with
helpless
rage
as
griselda
tingled
beside
him
but
yesterday
he
would
have
told
you
loftily
that
both
he
and
his
wife
were
inured
to
public
above
all
to
official
ridicule
but
it
is
one
thing
to
brave
ridicule
with
an
approving
audience
in
the
background
another
to
face
it
unapplauded
uncrowned
with
the
halo
of
the
martyr
they
reddened
and
quivered
whilst
incomprehensible
witticisms
passed
between
the
captain
and
his
clerk
it
was
an
intense
relief
when
a
nod
and
a
brief
order
signified
that
the
jest
was
sufficiently
enjoyed
and
their
audience
with
the
captain
at
an
end
they
were
too
thankful
even
to
resent
the
roughness
with
which
heinz
collared
his
man
while
his
comrade
collared
griselda
one
of
the
features
of
the
interview
that
struck
william
later
on
was
all
the
long
minutes
that
it
lasted
griselda
had
spoken
no
words
for
once
the
tumult
and
amazement
of
her
soul
was
beyond
her
glib
power
of
expression
and
it
was
only
as
they
came
into
the
open
air
the
first
time
since
she
had
seen
the
hostages
unclosed
her
lips
and
spoke
what
are
they
going
to
do
with
us
she
asked
her
voice
was
husky
and
uncertain
and
the
words
came
out
in
little
jerks
william
gave
the
question
no
answer
for
one
thing
because
his
ignorance
of
their
destiny
was
as
thorough
as
his
wife
s
for
another
because
speech
by
reason
of
heinz
s
firm
grip
on
his
collar
was
so
difficult
as
to
be
almost
impossible
the
man
had
his
knuckles
thrust
tightly
between
shirt
and
skin
william
purpled
and
gasped
as
he
trotted
down
the
street
with
a
collar
stud
pressing
on
his
windpipe
behind
him
when
he
started
came
griselda
and
her
guard
as
he
could
not
twist
his
head
to
look
over
his
shoulder
he
had
no
suspicion
that
the
couples
had
parted
company
and
it
was
not
until
his
captor
turned
him
sharply
to
the
right
down
a
leading
to
the
station
that
he
discovered
in
rounding
the
corner
that
his
wife
and
her
escort
were
no
longer
following
in
his
footsteps
the
momentary
sidelong
glimpse
he
caught
of
the
road
gave
him
never
a
sight
of
griselda
she
had
vanished
without
word
or
sign
for
a
moment
he
could
hardly
believe
it
and
walked
on
stupidly
in
silence
then
the
stupor
passing
his
terror
found
voice
and
he
clamoured
where
s
my
wife
he
cried
out
and
writhed
instinctively
to
free
himself
his
reward
was
a
tightening
of
the
german
s
some
most
hearty
abuse
and
some
even
heartier
kicks
under
the
punishment
he
lost
his
foothold
and
would
have
fallen
but
for
heinz
s
clutch
upon
his
collar
when
the
punishment
was
over
he
was
brought
up
trembling
and
choking
in
that
moment
he
suffered
the
fiercest
of
torments
the
fire
of
an
ineffectual
hate
he
hated
heinz
and
could
have
torn
him
but
he
had
been
taught
the
folly
of
blind
wrestling
with
the
stronger
and
for
griselda
s
sake
he
swallowed
his
fury
and
cringed
where
is
she
he
begged
most
humbly
and
pitifully
as
heinz
thrust
him
forward
again
for
mercy
s
sake
tell
me
what
you
have
done
with
my
my
wife
if
you
will
only
let
me
know
where
she
is
that
s
to
let
me
know
he
was
answered
by
the
silence
of
contempt
and
a
renewed
urge
along
the
road
he
obeyed
because
he
could
do
no
other
whimpering
aloud
in
the
misery
of
this
new
and
sharpest
of
misfortunes
as
he
pled
and
whimpered
terrible
thoughts
came
hurrying
into
his
brain
all
things
were
possible
in
these
evil
times
and
among
these
evil
there
was
a
dreadful
hideously
familiar
phrase
anent
licentious
soldiery
a
phrase
that
had
once
been
just
a
phrase
and
that
was
now
a
present
horror
beating
hard
in
his
burning
head
he
stumbled
on
with
the
tears
running
down
his
cheeks
and
discovered
suddenly
that
he
was
whispering
under
his
breath
the
name
of
things
else
having
failed
him
he
did
not
realize
that
he
was
sobbing
and
shedding
great
tears
until
halfway
along
the
road
when
a
german
soldier
met
them
the
man
as
he
passed
turned
his
head
to
laugh
at
the
sight
of
a
face
grotesque
and
distorted
in
its
wretchedness
whereupon
there
flared
up
again
in
william
that
new
sense
of
blood
and
breed
and
with
it
an
instant
rush
of
shame
that
he
had
wept
before
he
gulped
back
his
tears
strove
to
stiffen
his
face
and
clenched
his
hands
to
endure
he
had
need
in
the
hours
that
came
after
of
all
his
powers
of
endurance
alike
of
body
and
of
mind
the
day
that
already
seemed
was
far
from
being
at
its
height
when
griselda
was
taken
away
from
him
and
all
through
the
heat
till
close
upon
sundown
he
was
put
to
hard
physical
toil
level
with
the
village
the
railway
line
had
been
torn
up
and
the
little
wayside
station
was
a
mass
of
wreckage
a
detachment
of
retreating
belgians
had
done
their
best
to
destroy
it
had
derailed
an
engine
and
half
a
dozen
trucks
and
done
such
damage
as
time
allowed
to
a
stretch
of
the
permanent
way
in
its
turn
a
detachment
of
germans
was
hard
at
work
at
removal
of
the
wreckage
and
repairs
to
the
line
and
into
their
service
they
had
pressed
such
villagers
as
had
not
fled
at
their
approach
a
cowed
unhappy
band
they
toiled
and
sweated
dug
carried
loads
and
levelled
the
broken
soil
some
stupidly
submissive
some
openly
sullen
to
their
captors
some
pitiably
eager
to
please
all
serfs
for
the
time
being
and
all
of
them
ignorant
of
what
the
next
hour
might
bring
forth
of
further
terror
or
misfortune
to
this
captive
little
company
william
tully
was
joined
handed
over
by
heinz
to
its
become
of
them
all
the
most
pitiable
because
for
the
first
time
in
all
his
days
set
to
bend
his
back
and
use
his
muscles
in
downright
labour
of
the
body
what
to
others
was
merely
hardship
to
him
became
torment
unspeakable
he
wearied
he
sweated
he
ached
from
head
to
heel
when
he
pulled
at
heavy
wreckage
he
cut
his
soft
clumsy
fingers
when
he
dragged
a
load
or
carried
it
he
strained
his
unaccustomed
back
his
hands
bled
and
blistered
and
the
drops
of
perspiration
poured
off
him
when
he
worked
slowly
because
of
his
weariness
or
lack
of
skill
authority
made
no
allowance
for
either
and
a
blow
often
followed
a
curse
sometimes
incomprehensible
orders
were
shouted
at
him
and
he
would
run
to
obey
confusedly
for
fear
of
the
punishment
meted
out
without
mercy
to
the
at
what
was
required
of
him
sometimes
rightly
and
sometimes
wrongly
the
day
remained
on
his
mind
as
an
impression
of
muddled
terror
and
panic
intense
and
unceasing
when
he
thought
he
was
not
being
watched
he
would
lift
his
head
from
his
toil
and
strain
his
eyes
this
way
and
that
in
the
hope
of
a
glimpse
of
griselda
unspeakably
greater
than
his
fear
for
himself
was
the
measure
of
his
fear
for
his
wife
he
knew
that
somewhere
she
must
be
held
by
force
in
the
same
way
that
he
was
held
otherwise
she
would
have
sought
him
out
long
ere
this
and
even
if
not
allowed
to
approach
or
speak
would
have
managed
to
see
him
and
make
him
some
sign
that
his
heart
might
be
set
at
rest
his
brain
was
giddy
with
undefined
horror
and
once
or
twice
he
started
and
raised
his
head
imagining
that
griselda
was
calling
to
him
once
when
he
looked
up
his
eye
caught
the
bluff
towering
over
the
valley
and
he
remembered
with
an
incredulous
shock
that
it
was
only
yesterday
that
he
and
his
wife
stretched
out
on
the
turf
had
watched
the
galloping
of
the
ants
of
soldiers
beneath
it
was
not
a
day
since
they
had
listened
indifferently
to
the
mutter
of
guns
in
the
distance
and
talked
with
superior
detachment
of
manoeuvres
and
the
folly
of
militarism
side
by
side
on
the
turf
they
had
watched
unmoved
and
listened
without
misgiving
only
only
this
morning
when
the
sun
world
was
the
world
and
not
hell
he
knew
though
engrossed
by
his
private
agony
he
did
not
give
it
much
heed
that
all
the
afternoon
there
was
heavy
traffic
on
the
road
that
ran
through
the
village
traffic
going
this
way
and
that
now
and
again
through
the
clatter
of
the
work
around
him
its
rumble
came
to
his
ears
noisy
cars
went
by
and
heavy
guns
regiments
of
infantry
and
once
or
twice
a
company
of
horse
that
sped
westward
in
a
flurry
of
dust
as
the
hot
industrious
hours
crawled
by
even
his
terror
for
griselda
was
swallowed
up
in
the
numbing
and
sense
of
bodily
exhaustion
and
in
the
consciousness
of
throbbing
head
parched
mouth
and
miserable
back
at
midday
when
the
captives
were
doled
out
a
ration
of
meat
and
bread
he
lay
like
a
log
for
the
little
space
during
which
he
was
allowed
to
rest
and
resting
he
dreaded
from
the
bottom
of
his
soul
the
inevitable
call
back
to
work
with
it
all
was
the
hopeless
the
terrifying
sense
of
isolation
he
was
removed
even
from
his
held
apart
from
them
not
only
by
the
barrier
of
their
alien
speech
but
by
his
greater
feebleness
and
greater
physical
suffering
only
once
during
those
and
aching
hours
did
he
feel
himself
akin
to
any
of
the
men
around
a
sturdy
young
german
soldier
taking
pity
on
his
manifest
unfitness
for
the
work
muttered
some
incomprehensible
encouragement
and
handed
him
a
bottle
to
drink
from
the
sharp
taste
of
beer
was
a
liquid
blessing
to
william
s
dry
tongue
and
parched
throat
he
tilted
the
bottle
and
drank
in
great
gulps
till
he
choked
whereat
the
german
laughed
consumedly
but
not
unkindly
it
must
have
been
well
on
in
the
the
shadows
were
beginning
to
lengthen
though
the
sun
burned
hotly
as
over
the
noises
of
the
toil
around
him
and
over
the
rumble
of
traffic
on
the
road
the
persistent
beat
of
guns
became
loud
enough
to
make
itself
noticeable
all
day
william
had
heard
it
at
intervals
during
his
brief
rest
at
midday
it
had
been
frequent
but
distant
now
it
had
spurted
into
sudden
nearness
and
was
rapid
frequent
continuous
a
little
group
of
his
looked
up
from
their
work
as
they
heard
the
sound
drew
closer
together
and
exchanged
mutterings
till
an
order
checked
them
sharply
and
even
after
the
order
was
rapped
out
one
countryman
continued
to
stare
down
the
valley
with
stubbornly
determined
eyes
william
s
eyes
followed
the
countryman
s
and
for
a
moment
saw
nothing
but
what
he
had
seen
the
river
and
the
hot
blue
sky
without
a
feather
of
cloud
to
it
then
suddenly
away
down
the
valley
there
puffed
out
a
ball
of
white
smoke
and
before
it
had
faded
another
the
man
with
the
stubborn
eyes
grunted
something
beneath
his
breath
and
turned
again
to
his
work
william
continuing
to
gaze
curiously
at
the
bursting
puffs
was
reminded
of
his
duties
by
a
louder
shout
and
the
threat
of
a
lifted
arm
he
too
bent
again
and
with
haste
to
his
work
to
look
up
furtively
as
the
thunder
deepened
and
see
always
those
bursts
of
floating
cloud
down
the
valley
or
against
the
hot
horizon
he
knew
or
rather
guessed
in
after
days
when
his
sublime
ignorance
of
all
things
military
had
been
tempered
by
the
newspapers
by
daily
and
by
actual
contact
with
the
soldier
that
the
sudden
appearance
of
those
bursting
puffs
had
indicated
some
temporary
and
local
check
to
the
advancing
german
divisions
that
a
french
or
belgian
force
must
have
pushed
or
fought
its
way
across
the
triangular
plateau
between
the
meuse
and
its
tributary
must
have
driven
before
them
the
germans
in
the
act
of
occupying
it
must
have
brought
up
their
guns
and
commanded
for
the
moment
a
stretch
of
the
lateral
valley
and
the
line
of
communications
along
it
it
was
not
left
long
in
unmolested
possession
thereof
nearer
guns
answered
it
swiftly
from
all
directions
from
other
heights
and
from
the
valley
shells
whined
overhead
from
time
to
time
the
ground
shook
and
it
dawned
upon
william
as
he
looked
and
listened
that
what
he
saw
was
a
battle
at
first
he
was
more
impressed
by
the
thought
than
he
was
by
the
the
effects
of
the
conflict
were
not
in
the
beginning
terrible
true
there
was
something
threatening
in
the
thudding
of
a
german
battery
when
first
it
made
itself
heard
but
such
harm
as
it
inflicted
was
unseen
by
william
and
for
the
space
of
an
hour
or
so
it
drew
no
returning
fire
and
the
village
stood
untouched
and
undamaged
but
as
the
evening
drew
in
the
thunder
deepened
and
quickened
both
sides
it
would
seem
had
brought
up
reinforcements
and
guns
opened
fire
from
new
and
unexpected
places
from
heights
from
behind
garden
walls
down
the
road
along
which
william
had
been
urged
with
ungentleness
by
heinz
a
clattered
and
jingled
at
breakneck
speed
it
pulled
up
close
to
the
railway
line
not
fifty
yards
from
the
spot
where
the
prisoners
were
working
in
the
shadow
of
a
clump
of
young
trees
the
gun
was
placed
swiftly
in
position
the
horses
were
led
away
and
after
a
momentary
interval
the
men
began
to
swiftly
on
the
order
william
watched
them
with
his
mouth
wide
open
till
reminded
smartly
of
his
idleness
they
were
so
swift
precise
and
it
required
an
effort
of
the
imagination
to
remember
what
they
were
doing
killing
he
said
to
himself
those
men
are
killing
and
he
found
himself
wondering
what
their
faces
looked
like
while
they
killed
whether
they
liked
doing
it
he
supposed
later
when
that
first
ignorance
of
things
military
was
a
little
less
sublime
that
the
firing
from
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
village
had
at
first
inflicted
but
little
damage
on
the
opposing
forces
on
the
heights
at
any
rate
it
remained
practically
unanswered
till
close
upon
sunset
the
french
or
belgian
gunners
concentrating
their
fire
upon
enemies
nearer
more
aggressive
or
more
vulnerably
placed
perhaps
he
never
knew
for
certain
they
had
got
the
better
for
the
time
being
of
those
other
more
aggressive
or
more
vulnerable
opponents
perhaps
they
had
received
reinforcements
which
had
enabled
them
to
push
higher
up
the
valley
or
had
at
last
been
punished
by
a
fire
hitherto
ineffectual
whatever
the
cause
as
the
sun
grew
red
to
the
westward
a
first
shell
screamed
on
to
the
dusty
road
outside
the
village
and
burst
in
a
pother
of
smoke
and
flying
clods
william
heard
the
burst
and
saw
the
cloud
rise
he
was
still
when
another
shell
screamed
overhead
to
find
its
billet
in
a
garden
wall
a
few
yards
behind
the
battery
scattering
the
stones
thereof
and
splintering
the
boughs
of
an
a
shower
of
broken
fragments
came
pattering
about
the
station
william
was
perhaps
too
much
stupefied
by
pain
and
weariness
to
understand
the
extent
of
his
danger
but
several
of
his
fellows
stirred
uneasily
and
two
of
them
threw
down
their
spades
and
started
in
headlong
flight
they
were
brought
up
swiftly
by
the
threat
of
a
bayonet
in
their
path
one
of
them
came
back
sullenly
dumb
the
other
whimpering
aloud
with
a
hand
pressed
to
his
face
william
saw
that
his
cheek
was
bleeding
where
a
flying
fragment
had
caught
it
he
was
looking
at
the
man
as
he
nursed
his
torn
face
and
bemoaned
himself
when
a
third
shell
struck
what
remained
of
the
station
roof
william
did
not
know
whether
he
fell
on
his
face
instinctively
or
was
thrown
by
the
force
of
the
explosion
he
remembered
only
that
as
he
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
crying
for
help
he
saw
through
a
settling
cloud
of
dust
the
disappearing
backs
of
some
three
or
four
men
who
were
all
of
them
running
away
from
him
he
was
seized
with
a
mortal
terror
of
being
left
alone
in
this
torment
of
thunder
and
disaster
he
believed
he
must
be
hurt
perhaps
hurt
to
the
death
and
a
pang
of
rage
and
went
through
him
at
the
thought
of
his
desertion
by
his
fellows
he
started
after
the
vanishing
backs
calling
out
to
them
to
wait
abusing
and
appealing
and
stumbling
over
ruin
as
he
ran
the
distant
gunners
had
found
their
enemies
range
and
he
had
not
made
half
a
dozen
yards
when
he
ducked
to
the
threat
of
another
shell
that
burst
as
he
thought
close
beside
him
he
cringed
and
shivered
for
a
moment
covering
his
eyes
with
his
hands
then
finding
himself
uninjured
darted
off
at
an
angle
still
shielding
his
eyes
and
gasping
out
god
oh
mercy
s
sake
oh
god
he
knew
in
every
fibre
of
his
trembling
body
that
he
was
about
to
die
and
his
prayer
was
meant
not
only
for
himself
but
for
griselda
as
he
ran
on
blindly
an
animal
wild
and
unreasoning
a
hand
caught
him
above
the
ankle
and
he
screamed
aloud
with
rage
and
terror
at
finding
himself
held
fast
let
me
go
he
cried
struggling
then
as
the
hand
still
gripped
bent
down
to
wrest
himself
free
and
looked
into
a
face
that
he
young
plump
face
with
a
budding
moustache
surmounted
by
a
flat
german
cap
it
was
twisted
now
into
a
grin
of
agony
but
all
the
same
he
recognized
the
face
of
the
german
who
had
dealt
kindly
with
him
that
afternoon
in
the
matter
of
the
bottle
of
beer
he
was
lying
on
his
back
and
covered
from
the
middle
downwards
with
a
litter
of
broken
beam
and
ironwork
blown
away
from
the
ruin
of
the
station
the
effect
of
the
recognition
on
william
was
curiously
and
instantly
sobering
he
was
no
longer
alone
in
the
hell
where
the
ground
reeled
and
men
ran
from
him
he
was
no
longer
an
animal
wild
and
unreasoning
but
a
man
with
a
definite
human
relationship
to
the
boy
lying
broken
at
his
feet
he
began
to
lift
the
wreckage
from
the
crushed
legs
and
talked
as
he
did
so
forgetting
that
the
wounded
man
in
all
likelihood
understood
not
a
word
of
his
english
all
right
i
ll
get
it
off
i
ll
help
you
you
were
good
to
me
giving
me
a
drink
so
i
ll
stay
and
help
you
otherwise
i
oughtn
t
to
wait
not
a
see
i
must
look
for
my
wife
my
first
duty
is
to
s
my
wife
and
i
don
t
know
where
she
is
but
i
won
t
leave
you
like
this
because
of
what
you
did
for
me
this
afternoon
he
wrenched
and
tugged
at
the
shattered
and
entangled
wreckage
till
the
boy
shrieked
aloud
in
his
cry
terrified
william
and
he
desisted
wringing
his
hands
i
m
sorry
i
m
sorry
but
i
couldn
t
help
it
god
knows
i
didn
t
mean
to
hurt
you
and
if
i
could
be
gentler
i
would
but
it
s
so
damnably
damnably
heavy
oh
god
if
some
one
would
come
and
help
me
if
someone
would
only
come
you
see
it
s
so
heavy
i
can
t
move
it
without
hurting
you
he
explained
and
apologized
to
ears
that
heard
not
for
the
boy
had
fainted
in
his
pain
his
deep
unconsciousness
made
extrication
easier
and
william
tugged
again
at
the
lumber
until
he
had
tugged
it
away
one
of
the
wounded
man
s
leg
s
was
a
wrenched
and
bloody
mass
william
shuddered
at
the
sight
looked
down
stupidly
at
the
dead
white
face
and
wondered
what
was
to
be
feeling
that
something
must
at
least
be
tried
put
his
arms
round
the
inert
body
and
strove
to
lift
it
from
the
ground
the
only
results
were
breathlessness
on
his
part
and
a
groan
from
the
unconscious
german
william
dropped
him
instantly
on
hearing
the
groan
trembling
at
the
idea
of
inflicting
yet
more
suffering
torn
by
the
thought
of
griselda
longing
to
go
and
yet
ashamed
to
leave
the
without
aid
he
might
have
hesitated
longer
but
a
for
fresh
explosion
and
crash
of
falling
masonry
it
was
followed
by
a
screaming
intolerable
to
aie
aie
aie
of
unspeakable
bodily
pain
with
a
sudden
sense
of
being
hunted
being
driven
beyond
endurance
william
turned
and
shook
his
impotent
fists
in
the
direction
of
the
unseen
guns
can
t
you
stop
one
moment
he
screamed
idiotically
hating
them
and
dancing
with
rage
can
t
you
stop
you
devils
don
t
you
see
i
m
only
trying
to
help
him
if
he
had
ever
made
any
distinction
between
friend
and
enemy
artillery
he
had
lost
all
idea
of
it
now
the
guns
for
the
moment
were
a
private
persecution
of
himself
and
he
was
conscious
only
of
being
foully
and
brutally
bullied
by
monstrous
forces
with
whom
he
argued
and
at
whom
he
cursed
and
spat
it
was
the
sight
of
what
had
once
been
a
horse
that
brought
him
again
to
his
senses
his
eye
fell
on
it
as
he
danced
in
his
mad
ineptitude
at
the
side
of
the
helpless
german
it
had
been
one
of
the
team
that
galloped
a
gun
down
the
and
was
now
a
pulp
of
raw
flesh
crushed
bone
and
most
hideously
scattered
entrail
he
stared
for
a
moment
at
the
horror
incredulous
and
sickened
turned
and
ran
from
it
in
a
passion
of
physical
loathing
for
a
minute
or
two
he
ran
he
knew
not
ahead
anywhere
to
be
away
from
the
horror
then
as
his
shuddering
sickness
passed
there
rushed
back
the
thought
of
griselda
and
he
reproached
himself
that
he
had
halted
even
for
a
moment
and
even
for
a
purpose
of
mercy
all
his
energies
both
of
mind
and
body
were
turned
to
the
finding
of
his
wife
they
must
die
he
was
sure
of
it
he
prayed
only
that
they
died
together
the
way
he
had
taken
lay
outside
the
walled
gardens
between
the
village
and
the
railway
line
and
as
he
ran
he
called
griselda
griselda
a
voice
that
he
hardly
caught
himself
so
persistent
was
the
uproar
of
the
guns
when
he
fled
from
the
neighbourhood
of
the
dismembered
horse
he
had
left
behind
him
the
path
leading
directly
to
the
main
street
of
the
it
was
his
aim
to
reach
since
there
he
had
last
seen
griselda
seeking
another
way
to
it
he
halted
when
he
came
to
a
door
in
the
wall
wrestled
with
the
latch
and
flung
himself
angrily
against
it
it
resisted
locked
and
he
ran
on
again
still
panting
out
his
wife
s
dear
name
twenty
yards
further
on
he
came
to
another
door
in
the
wall
and
this
time
it
opened
to
his
hand
in
the
garden
beyond
was
no
sign
of
the
chaos
that
had
overwhelmed
his
world
since
the
morning
an
orderly
border
of
orderly
flowers
espaliered
walls
and
a
tree
or
two
ruddy
with
apples
and
on
a
shaven
plot
of
the
greenest
grass
an
empty
basket
chair
with
beside
it
a
white
cat
reposing
with
her
paws
tucked
under
her
chin
the
white
cat
may
have
been
deaf
or
she
may
have
been
merely
intrepid
whatever
the
cause
her
nerves
were
unaffected
by
the
fury
of
conflict
and
she
dozed
serenely
under
the
embodiment
of
comfortable
dignity
she
opened
a
warily
observant
eye
when
william
rushed
into
her
garden
but
being
a
cat
and
accustomed
to
deference
she
took
no
further
precaution
she
stirred
not
even
when
he
hurried
past
her
to
her
and
as
he
entered
it
by
an
open
window
her
nose
descended
to
rest
on
her
folded
paws
the
room
he
ran
into
through
the
open
window
left
no
impression
on
the
mind
of
william
tully
it
was
dark
after
the
sunlight
outside
and
he
supposed
it
must
have
been
empty
he
went
rapidly
along
the
short
passage
beyond
it
making
for
the
front
door
he
met
no
one
heard
no
one
and
his
fingers
were
touching
the
latch
when
he
saw
through
an
open
door
to
the
right
of
him
the
figure
of
a
kneeling
woman
she
was
stout
dressed
in
black
and
and
she
knelt
leaning
on
a
chair
in
the
middle
of
the
polished
floor
her
eyes
were
closed
her
lips
moved
and
her
hands
were
clasped
under
her
chin
the
sound
of
william
s
feet
did
not
reach
her
through
the
tumult
of
fighting
without
nor
did
he
stay
to
disturb
her
when
he
lived
in
the
world
and
not
hell
it
would
have
seemed
to
him
strange
and
unfitting
that
he
should
intrude
on
an
old
woman
s
privacy
and
secret
prayer
now
nothing
was
strange
nothing
unfitting
or
impossible
he
supposed
that
she
was
the
white
cat
s
mistress
noted
without
emotion
that
her
cheeks
were
wet
with
tears
and
thought
vaguely
that
her
face
was
familiar
that
he
had
seen
it
somewhere
before
afterwards
it
came
to
him
that
he
had
seen
it
when
the
hostages
died
in
the
morning
that
it
was
she
who
had
prayed
in
the
road
with
folded
hands
and
pressed
her
crucifix
to
the
mayor
s
long
grey
moustache
he
wondered
then
what
became
of
her
and
her
indifferent
cat
that
was
afterwards
many
weeks
afterwards
for
the
time
being
he
had
no
interest
to
give
her
his
thoughts
were
only
of
griselda
and
the
means
by
which
she
might
be
found
his
plan
so
far
as
it
could
be
called
a
plan
was
to
run
from
house
to
house
in
the
village
street
until
he
came
to
the
place
where
she
was
captive
but
when
he
stepped
into
the
road
it
was
to
find
it
impossible
of
passage
by
reason
of
the
men
and
vehicles
that
choked
the
stretch
in
front
of
him
almost
opposite
the
door
he
came
through
a
going
eastward
with
its
load
had
collided
with
an
ammunition
wagon
going
west
thus
bringing
to
a
standstill
more
ammunition
wagons
and
a
battery
of
its
foremost
ranks
thrown
back
in
confusion
by
a
threatening
skid
of
the
ambulance
there
was
much
whistling
and
shouting
of
orders
in
the
attempt
to
reform
and
clear
the
road
horses
reared
from
the
suddenness
with
which
they
were
pulled
up
and
men
ran
to
their
heads
to
steady
them
while
the
locked
wheels
were
wrestled
with
a
bandaged
bloody
face
peered
round
the
tail
of
the
ambulance
the
press
swayed
to
and
fro
filling
the
road
from
side
to
side
and
william
unable
to
move
flattened
back
against
the
door
from
which
he
had
issued
out
of
reach
of
the
wicked
heels
of
a
restive
horse
for
the
first
moment
he
expected
some
one
to
seize
and
arrest
him
and
had
he
not
unthinkingly
closed
the
door
behind
him
he
would
have
beat
a
hasty
retreat
but
there
was
bloodier
and
busier
work
on
hand
than
the
corraling
of
stray
civilians
and
no
man
touched
or
questioned
him
as
he
pressed
himself
against
the
neat
door
struggling
with
their
own
most
urgent
concerns
not
a
soldier
so
much
as
noticed
him
and
it
was
borne
in
on
william
that
if
the
wicked
heels
had
caught
him
and
kicked
his
life
out
not
a
man
would
have
noticed
that
either
further
down
the
street
was
a
cloud
of
slowly
rising
black
suddenly
through
it
a
banner
of
flame
leaped
up
and
waved
triumphantly
one
of
the
tidy
houses
had
been
set
afire
by
a
shell
as
william
watched
the
resplendent
flare
the
crowd
round
the
two
vehicles
composed
itself
into
something
like
order
and
the
driver
by
the
excited
movements
of
his
mouth
still
shouting
out
angry
backed
from
the
path
of
the
advancing
troops
and
thrust
crippled
against
the
wall
the
guns
on
one
side
of
the
road
the
wagons
on
the
other
stirred
first
slowly
then
as
the
line
straightened
itself
out
with
a
rattle
of
increasing
speed
as
they
passed
the
house
afire
the
smoke
rolled
down
on
them
and
hid
them
from
william
s
sight
with
the
conviction
that
no
one
was
heeding
his
comings
and
goings
a
certain
amount
of
assurance
came
back
to
william
tully
and
as
the
way
cleared
before
him
he
set
off
down
the
street
without
any
attempt
at
concealment
by
house
to
house
visitation
he
sought
for
his
wife
through
the
village
it
was
there
she
had
been
taken
from
him
and
he
thrust
back
the
deadly
suspicion
that
she
need
not
have
remained
in
the
place
where
she
had
disappeared
from
his
sight
there
was
not
a
closed
door
in
the
length
of
the
street
and
nowhere
was
his
entrance
barred
the
call
to
arms
had
temporarily
cleared
the
houses
of
the
invaders
quartered
in
them
and
he
ran
from
one
doorway
to
another
unhindered
calling
on
griselda
as
he
entered
looking
into
every
room
and
then
out
to
repeat
the
process
the
two
first
houses
were
empty
from
garret
to
cellar
but
with
signs
of
having
been
left
recently
and
hurriedly
by
the
soldiers
billeted
therein
odds
and
ends
of
military
kit
were
scattered
about
chairs
overturned
and
left
lying
and
in
one
room
a
kitchen
on
a
fire
a
blackened
frizzle
of
meat
in
a
filled
the
air
with
a
smell
of
burning
the
third
house
he
thought
likewise
empty
downstairs
there
was
the
same
furniture
and
food
half
eaten
on
the
table
but
opening
the
door
of
an
upper
room
he
came
on
a
woman
with
three
children
the
woman
started
to
her
feet
as
the
door
opened
a
child
hugged
to
her
bosom
and
other
two
clinging
to
her
skirt
and
william
had
a
passing
impression
of
a
plump
pallid
face
with
lips
apart
and
wide
wet
eyes
and
one
of
the
children
was
mouth
was
rounded
in
a
you
heard
nothing
of
its
vigorous
plaint
for
the
louder
din
without
william
made
a
gesture
that
he
meant
to
be
reassuring
shut
the
door
and
ran
back
into
the
street
he
went
in
and
out
desperately
like
a
creature
hunted
or
hunting
and
having
drawn
blank
in
house
after
house
the
deadly
thought
refused
to
be
thrust
and
kept
under
if
they
had
taken
her
away
she
might
be
anywhere
east
or
west
gone
in
any
direction
and
leaving
no
clue
for
her
following
anywhere
in
a
blind
incomprehensible
world
where
men
killed
men
and
might
was
right
and
life
as
he
knew
it
from
his
childhood
up
had
ended
in
an
orgy
of
devilry
he
went
on
running
from
house
to
house
while
shells
screamed
and
burst
and
guns
clattered
by
and
no
man
gave
heed
to
his
running
or
the
tumult
and
torture
of
his
fears
upstairs
and
down
and
out
and
down
and
out
he
was
nearing
the
end
of
the
street
when
he
found
her
at
last
in
the
upper
back
room
of
a
little
white
house
some
yards
beyond
the
building
in
flames
and
not
far
from
the
spot
where
they
had
seen
the
hostages
die
she
was
alone
and
did
not
move
when
he
flung
the
door
open
crouched
in
a
corner
with
her
head
on
her
knees
she
neither
saw
nor
heard
him
for
an
instant
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
strength
would
fail
him
for
gladness
and
he
staggered
and
held
to
the
door
as
the
giddiness
passed
he
ran
to
her
babbling
inaudible
relief
and
pulled
the
hands
from
her
face
he
had
an
instant
s
glimpse
of
it
white
and
with
swollen
lips
and
red
eyes
then
as
his
arms
went
round
her
and
he
had
her
up
from
the
floor
it
went
down
on
his
shoulder
and
was
hidden
he
felt
her
clinging
to
him
trembling
against
him
sobbing
against
him
while
he
held
all
his
soul
was
a
passion
of
endearment
and
thankfulness
so
for
a
minute
or
clung
to
each
other
reunited
until
william
his
sense
of
their
peril
returning
sought
to
urge
his
wife
to
the
door
she
came
with
him
for
a
step
or
two
her
head
still
on
his
shoulder
then
suddenly
she
shivered
and
wrestled
in
his
arms
thrust
him
from
her
rushed
back
to
the
end
of
the
room
and
leaned
against
it
shaking
with
misery
her
arm
was
raised
over
her
hidden
face
and
pressed
against
the
wall
and
he
saw
what
he
had
not
seen
before
that
the
sleeve
was
torn
and
the
flesh
near
the
wrist
bruised
and
reddened
he
saw
eyes
being
it
was
not
only
her
hair
that
was
tumbled
all
her
dress
was
disordered
and
awry
there
was
another
tear
under
the
armpit
where
the
sleeve
had
given
way
and
the
white
of
her
underlinen
showed
through
the
gap
his
heart
cried
out
to
him
that
she
had
struggled
merely
as
a
captive
had
been
restrained
by
brute
force
from
his
own
eyes
had
seen
that
she
turned
from
him
as
if
there
was
a
barrier
between
them
as
if
there
was
something
to
hide
that
yet
she
wished
him
to
know
for
a
moment
he
fought
with
the
certainty
and
then
it
came
down
on
him
like
a
storm
for
once
in
his
life
his
imagination
was
vivid
and
he
saw
with
the
eyes
of
his
mind
as
clearly
as
with
the
eyes
of
his
body
all
the
details
the
animal
details
her
cries
and
her
pitiful
wrestlings
and
the
phrase
licentious
soldiery
personified
in
the
face
of
the
man
who
had
been
griselda
s
gaoler
round
and
roughly
in
repose
with
black
eyebrows
and
a
chin
he
caught
her
by
the
hands
and
said
something
to
out
words
that
stammered
and
she
sobbed
and
turned
her
face
from
him
again
after
that
he
could
not
remember
what
he
felt
or
how
long
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
oblivious
of
danger
and
staring
at
her
heaving
shoulders
and
the
tumbled
hair
that
covered
them
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
talked
and
moved
his
hands
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
in
the
end
there
must
have
come
to
him
some
measure
of
helpless
acquiescence
or
perhaps
he
was
quieted
and
taken
out
of
himself
by
the
need
of
giving
help
to
griselda
after
how
long
he
knew
not
he
found
himself
once
more
with
his
arms
around
her
she
let
him
take
her
hand
he
kissed
it
and
stroked
her
poor
hair
this
time
she
came
with
him
when
he
led
her
to
the
door
and
they
went
down
the
stairway
together
near
the
street
door
she
hesitated
and
halted
and
he
saw
she
had
something
to
say
where
are
we
going
she
asked
with
her
lips
to
his
ear
can
we
get
away
he
told
her
he
thought
so
that
now
was
the
time
when
they
might
slip
away
to
encourage
her
by
the
assumption
of
a
greater
confidence
than
he
felt
fortune
favoured
them
however
and
the
assumption
of
confidence
was
justified
though
the
bombardment
had
slackened
as
suddenly
as
it
had
begun
the
remnant
of
german
soldiery
left
in
the
place
was
still
too
much
occupied
with
its
own
concerns
to
interfere
with
a
couple
of
civilians
seeking
safety
in
the
rear
of
the
and
no
one
paid
any
heed
to
them
as
they
made
their
way
along
the
street
they
turned
inevitably
from
the
the
road
they
had
come
that
morning
two
hunted
dishevelled
little
figures
keeping
well
to
the
wall
and
glancing
over
their
shoulders
the
crush
of
wagons
of
guns
and
men
had
moved
forward
and
out
of
the
village
which
for
the
moment
seemed
clear
of
all
but
for
the
ubiquitous
cyclist
who
dashed
backwards
and
forwards
in
his
dust
an
ambulance
was
discharging
its
load
at
a
building
whence
waved
the
red
cross
and
near
at
hand
but
out
of
sight
a
battery
was
thudding
regularly
but
of
the
few
uniformed
figures
in
the
street
itself
there
was
none
whose
business
it
was
to
interest
himself
in
their
movements
they
hurried
on
clinging
to
each
other
and
hugging
the
when
a
heap
of
fallen
brickwork
a
derelict
vehicle
or
other
obstacle
forced
them
out
into
the
road
they
were
almost
at
the
entry
of
the
village
when
they
came
upon
such
an
obstacle
the
upper
part
of
one
of
the
endmost
houses
had
evidently
been
struck
by
a
shell
for
a
large
slice
of
roof
and
outside
wall
had
crumbled
to
the
pathway
below
it
had
crumbled
but
recently
since
the
dust
was
still
clouding
thickly
above
the
ruin
and
veiling
the
roadway
beyond
it
hence
as
they
skirted
its
borders
it
was
not
until
he
was
actually
upon
them
that
they
were
aware
of
a
speeding
furiously
out
of
the
dusk
the
roar
of
the
battery
a
few
yards
away
had
drowned
the
whirr
of
his
machine
and
griselda
was
almost
under
it
before
she
had
warning
of
its
coming
the
stooping
rider
yelled
and
swerved
but
not
enough
to
avoid
her
she
went
down
flung
sideways
while
the
cyclist
almost
ran
on
to
the
heap
of
rubble
on
his
recovering
his
balance
dashed
forward
and
was
lost
in
the
dusk
save
for
that
momentary
swerve
and
stagger
he
had
passed
like
a
bolt
on
his
errand
leaving
griselda
crumpled
in
the
road
at
william
s
feet
to
his
mind
no
doubt
a
mishap
most
luckily
avoided
griselda
lay
without
moving
her
face
to
the
dust
and
for
one
tortured
moment
william
thought
the
life
beaten
out
of
her
but
when
he
raised
her
her
lips
moved
as
if
in
a
moan
and
as
he
dragged
her
for
safety
to
the
side
of
the
road
she
turned
her
head
on
his
arm
he
laid
her
down
while
he
ran
for
water
from
the
river
panted
to
its
brim
soaked
his
handkerchief
for
lack
of
a
cup
brought
it
back
and
pressed
it
to
her
forehead
her
eyes
when
she
opened
them
were
glazed
with
pain
and
her
lips
drawn
tightly
to
her
teeth
when
he
wanted
to
raise
her
to
a
sitting
position
she
caught
his
hand
thrust
it
from
her
and
lay
with
her
white
face
working
so
she
lay
for
minutes
that
seemed
hours
with
her
husband
kneeling
beside
her
men
passed
them
but
stayed
not
and
once
when
william
looked
up
a
car
was
speeding
by
with
helmeted
officers
inside
intent
on
their
own
hasty
business
of
death
to
have
so
much
as
a
glance
to
spare
for
a
woman
in
agony
of
bodily
pain
and
a
man
in
agony
of
mind
the
night
had
come
down
before
griselda
was
able
to
move
with
its
fall
the
battery
was
silenced
and
the
distant
thunder
less
frequent
so
that
william
was
able
to
hear
her
when
she
spoke
and
asked
him
to
lift
her
he
sobbed
for
joy
as
he
lifted
her
gently
and
trembling
lest
he
hurt
her
she
sat
leaning
on
his
arm
breathing
painfully
and
telling
him
in
jerks
that
it
was
her
side
that
pained
her
left
side
and
her
left
arm
but
most
of
all
her
side
at
first
she
seemed
dazed
and
conscious
only
of
her
about
them
pitifully
with
intervals
of
after
ten
minutes
or
so
she
caught
his
sleeve
and
tugged
it
let
s
get
away
help
me
up
he
suggested
that
she
should
rest
a
little
longer
but
she
urged
him
with
trembling
let
s
get
away
and
he
had
perforce
to
raise
her
in
spite
of
the
fever
for
flight
that
had
taken
possession
of
her
she
cried
out
as
he
helped
her
to
her
feet
and
stood
swaying
with
her
eyes
shut
and
her
teeth
bitten
hard
together
he
would
have
lain
her
down
again
but
she
signed
a
no
no
at
the
attempt
and
gripped
at
his
shoulder
to
steady
herself
then
after
a
moment
guided
his
arm
round
her
body
so
that
he
could
hold
her
without
giving
unnecessary
pain
you
mustn
t
press
my
can
t
bear
it
but
if
you
put
your
hand
on
my
they
moved
away
from
the
village
at
a
snail
s
pace
griselda
leaning
heavily
on
her
husband
behind
them
at
first
was
the
red
light
from
burning
houses
but
as
they
crawled
onwards
the
darkness
of
the
valley
closed
in
on
them
until
in
the
sombre
shadow
of
the
cliff
william
could
only
distinguish
his
wife
s
face
as
a
whitish
patch
upon
his
shoulder
when
she
groaned
as
she
did
from
time
to
time
he
halted
to
give
her
relief
but
she
would
never
allow
him
to
stand
for
more
than
a
minute
or
two
after
a
few
painful
breaths
there
would
come
the
tug
of
her
fingers
at
his
coat
that
was
the
sign
to
move
forward
again
once
or
twice
she
whispered
to
know
if
any
one
were
coming
after
them
and
he
could
feel
her
whole
body
with
fear
at
the
thought
barred
in
by
cliff
to
right
and
river
to
left
they
kept
perforce
to
the
rather
to
the
turf
that
bordered
it
the
traffic
on
the
road
itself
had
not
ceased
with
the
falling
of
night
cars
were
coming
up
and
guns
were
coming
up
and
the
valley
was
alive
with
their
at
every
passing
griselda
shrank
and
her
fingers
shivered
in
their
grip
upon
william
s
sleeve
can
t
we
get
away
from
them
she
whispered
at
last
right
away
and
t
we
turn
off
the
road
he
said
helplessly
that
he
did
not
know
where
until
they
reached
the
entrance
to
their
valley
it
s
all
the
river
on
the
other
side
she
had
known
it
without
asking
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
drag
herself
along
to
both
the
distance
was
griselda
s
terror
of
recapture
communicated
itself
to
her
husband
and
he
shivered
even
as
she
did
at
the
rattle
of
a
passing
car
instinctively
they
kept
to
the
shadow
stumbling
in
its
blackness
over
the
uneven
ground
below
the
cliff
once
when
a
couple
of
patrolling
horsemen
halted
near
them
in
the
roadway
they
crouched
and
held
their
breath
during
an
eternity
of
dreadful
seconds
while
they
prayed
that
they
had
not
been
noticed
it
seemed
to
william
that
his
heart
stopped
beating
when
one
of
the
horsemen
walked
his
beast
a
yard
or
two
nearer
and
flashed
a
light
into
their
faces
but
the
man
having
surveyed
them
turned
away
indifferently
and
followed
his
comrade
down
the
road
that
was
just
before
they
came
to
the
gap
in
the
heights
that
led
into
the
valley
of
silence
as
they
entered
it
for
the
last
time
in
both
their
minds
was
the
thought
that
they
might
find
it
barred
to
them
and
the
beating
of
their
hearts
was
loud
in
their
ears
as
they
crept
into
its
friendly
shadow
the
woods
griselda
whispered
they
turned
into
the
woods
and
took
cover
and
with
a
yard
or
two
the
blackness
under
the
trees
had
closed
in
on
them
blotting
out
all
things
from
sight
they
halted
because
they
could
see
to
walk
no
further
let
me
down
griselda
her
husband
knew
by
the
gasp
in
her
voice
that
she
was
at
the
end
of
her
powers
of
endurance
he
explored
with
an
outstretched
hand
for
a
tree
trunk
and
lowered
her
gently
to
the
ground
with
her
back
supported
against
it
she
panted
relief
as
he
sat
down
beside
her
and
groped
for
her
fingers
in
the
darkness
so
they
sat
holding
to
each
other
and
enveloped
in
thickest
night
the
guns
had
died
down
altogether
and
the
rumble
from
the
road
though
almost
continuous
was
that
william
could
hear
his
wife
s
uneven
breathing
and
the
stealthy
whisper
of
the
trees
he
sat
holding
griselda
s
hand
and
staring
into
the
blackness
a
man
dazed
and
confounded
who
yesterday
was
happy
lover
and
citizen
and
had
suffered
stripes
been
slave
and
fugitive
learned
the
evil
wrought
on
his
wife
thinking
on
it
afterwards
he
wondered
that
he
had
closed
an
eye
yet
he
had
sat
in
the
darkness
but
a
very
few
minutes
when
swiftly
and
without
warning
he
fell
into
a
heavy
sleep
he
woke
with
the
blaze
of
the
eastern
sun
in
his
eyes
and
on
the
first
sensation
of
bewilderment
at
finding
his
bed
was
moss
came
a
rush
of
remembrance
and
with
it
had
slept
while
griselda
suffered
he
knelt
and
bent
over
her
as
she
lay
still
asleep
huddled
on
her
right
side
her
face
was
flushed
her
lips
were
cracked
and
she
was
breathing
in
heavy
little
snorts
as
he
knelt
and
gazed
the
thunder
of
yesterday
broke
out
in
the
distance
and
griselda
stirred
and
woke
moaning
her
first
cry
was
for
water
and
in
the
insistence
of
her
thirst
she
was
oblivious
of
everything
but
her
burning
need
to
slake
it
he
broke
cover
and
ran
to
the
stream
some
fifty
yards
away
soaked
his
handkerchief
and
made
a
tight
cup
of
his
hands
the
cup
was
a
failure
and
the
little
that
was
left
in
it
when
he
reached
griselda
was
spilled
when
she
tried
to
drink
but
the
dripping
handkerchief
she
sucked
at
eagerly
and
gave
back
for
another
soaking
he
was
about
to
break
cover
to
wet
it
again
when
he
caught
sight
first
of
one
then
of
horsemen
entering
the
valley
by
the
gap
and
shrank
back
cowering
into
the
friendly
shelter
of
the
with
uncertainty
as
to
whether
or
no
they
had
seen
him
he
judged
not
when
he
saw
them
dismount
and
picket
their
horses
and
having
watched
them
long
enough
to
see
that
they
were
making
preparations
for
a
meal
he
turned
and
crept
back
to
griselda
the
terror
of
yesterday
came
down
on
her
when
she
heard
his
whispered
news
a
moment
before
she
had
seemed
incapable
of
movement
lain
crumpled
on
her
side
and
repulsed
with
a
feverish
pettishness
his
efforts
to
stir
and
raise
her
now
she
clung
to
him
and
struggled
to
her
feet
even
pain
forgotten
in
the
passion
for
instant
flight
so
holding
together
they
fled
again
fled
crawling
they
knew
not
whither
two
instincts
guided
them
and
directed
their
stumbling
footsteps
the
instinct
to
leave
far
behind
them
the
threat
of
the
guns
and
the
instinct
to
keep
out
of
sight
thus
they
held
to
the
woods
above
the
valley
of
silence
avoiding
all
paths
that
led
out
into
the
open
their
direction
roughly
was
they
did
not
know
they
dragged
a
mile
or
even
less
where
a
man
in
health
might
make
five
when
they
had
gone
some
few
hundred
yards
they
struck
the
trickle
of
a
rivulet
on
its
way
to
join
the
stream
in
the
valley
at
the
sound
of
its
babble
griselda
cried
out
and
tried
to
hasten
and
when
they
came
to
it
slipped
down
till
she
could
thrust
her
face
into
the
water
and
drink
like
the
israelites
who
marched
with
gideon
they
drank
they
dabbled
in
it
bathed
hands
and
feet
and
griselda
washed
her
broken
it
gingerly
and
not
daring
to
pull
away
the
linen
that
the
blood
had
caked
to
the
flesh
after
that
william
helped
her
to
her
feet
and
they
dragged
on
further
if
they
found
water
in
abundance
they
found
but
little
to
eat
and
though
griselda
made
no
complaint
of
hunger
as
the
hours
went
by
it
gnawed
at
her
husband
s
vitals
at
first
their
path
lay
chiefly
through
beechwoods
bare
of
undergrowth
and
they
had
been
an
hour
or
two
on
their
way
before
they
came
to
blackberry
bushes
upon
these
william
fell
tearing
his
hands
on
the
thorns
by
his
eager
stripping
of
the
bushes
griselda
would
hardly
touch
them
but
he
shovelled
them
into
his
mouth
and
ate
long
and
voraciously
he
had
toiled
much
the
day
before
and
eaten
scanty
breakfast
and
the
scraps
of
bread
and
meat
allotted
by
his
captors
at
shovel
as
he
might
the
berries
were
a
poor
substitute
for
the
meal
he
craved
and
dreamed
of
that
was
a
meal
which
floated
before
the
eye
of
his
mind
as
phantom
ham
and
eggs
phantom
cuts
from
the
joint
thick
slabs
of
bread
something
solid
that
a
man
could
set
his
teeth
in
and
gnaw
till
his
stomach
was
satisfied
he
was
ashamed
of
the
way
in
which
food
and
the
longing
for
food
possessed
that
there
were
moments
when
the
phantom
joint
was
more
present
to
his
mind
than
griselda
or
the
fear
of
death
itself
to
the
phase
of
violent
and
savage
hunger
succeeded
with
hours
a
giddy
dreaminess
the
result
of
growing
exhaustion
as
the
day
wore
on
and
exhaustion
increased
his
mind
like
his
body
refused
to
work
connectedly
his
feet
often
stumbled
and
he
was
incapable
of
consecutive
thought
once
he
found
himself
sitting
with
griselda
under
a
holding
her
fingers
and
considering
how
they
had
come
there
and
why
they
had
got
to
go
on
and
wandering
off
into
vague
recollection
of
the
story
of
a
knightly
lover
who
had
carried
his
mistress
long
miles
through
a
forest
in
his
arms
the
details
of
the
story
escaped
his
memory
and
he
sought
for
them
with
pettish
insistence
with
perhaps
at
the
back
of
his
mind
some
idea
born
of
that
did
he
but
remember
them
he
could
do
the
same
service
for
griselda
he
had
soon
lost
all
sense
of
direction
but
the
instinct
to
hide
never
left
him
and
once
or
twice
when
the
wood
seemed
to
be
opening
out
he
drew
his
wife
back
to
the
solitude
under
the
trees
with
the
passing
of
the
hours
their
rests
by
the
way
grew
longer
griselda
was
able
to
keep
her
feet
for
a
few
minutes
only
before
she
muttered
or
signed
a
request
for
another
halt
whereat
william
would
lower
her
to
the
ground
where
she
propped
herself
against
a
or
lay
huddled
and
silent
with
closed
eyes
at
one
such
halt
he
fell
suddenly
and
helplessly
asleep
perhaps
griselda
did
the
same
for
though
the
sun
was
high
when
he
sat
him
down
the
woods
were
heavy
with
blue
dusk
when
she
roused
him
by
a
tugging
at
his
sleeve
she
was
craving
again
for
water
her
lips
were
cracked
for
the
want
of
it
they
rose
and
went
blindly
in
every
few
minutes
as
much
to
strain
their
ears
for
the
ripple
as
to
give
griselda
strength
more
than
once
she
was
at
failing
point
so
much
so
that
he
suggested
she
should
lie
down
while
he
hunted
further
for
a
stream
she
refused
trembling
at
the
idea
of
being
left
but
perhaps
wisely
since
william
astray
in
the
darkening
woods
might
well
have
had
difficulty
in
finding
his
way
to
her
again
the
dusk
was
more
than
dusk
before
they
found
what
they
sought
it
was
actual
darkness
of
night
descending
to
cover
the
earth
they
had
halted
perforce
more
than
once
when
griselda
could
go
no
further
but
always
her
thirst
burned
her
and
she
rose
and
struggled
forward
again
she
was
past
speaking
when
they
came
on
a
clearing
and
then
on
a
stream
that
ran
through
it
of
which
they
were
only
aware
when
they
trod
into
the
marshy
ground
at
its
brim
she
drank
heavily
lay
inert
and
seemed
to
sleep
perhaps
because
he
had
slept
for
so
long
in
the
afternoon
her
husband
was
more
wakeful
for
hours
he
sat
with
his
eyes
wide
and
his
chin
propped
on
his
hands
after
nightfall
had
come
silence
from
the
guns
and
at
first
the
only
sounds
were
forest
talk
and
the
lapping
of
unseen
water
at
his
feet
later
griselda
was
restless
and
became
conversational
talking
rapidly
and
brokenly
in
a
delirium
of
pain
and
fever
and
paying
no
heed
to
his
efforts
to
answer
and
calm
her
her
mind
uncontrolled
had
returned
to
a
familiar
channel
she
was
back
in
the
world
that
had
crumbled
but
yesterday
waging
war
as
she
understood
it
till
she
saw
the
hostages
die
the
great
civil
war
that
you
fought
with
martyrdoms
with
protests
at
meetings
and
hammers
on
could
hear
she
was
back
in
the
thick
of
it
incoherently
addressing
an
audience
snatches
of
mckenna
the
sins
of
the
labour
emerging
from
a
torrent
of
incomprehensibility
the
names
of
the
leaders
of
the
movement
he
listened
crouched
in
the
darkness
a
starving
had
seen
men
dismembered
and
done
to
death
in
a
war
that
was
not
civil
and
suddenly
crouched
and
starving
in
the
darkness
he
began
to
laugh
out
loud
he
plainly
he
letter
written
to
the
daily
press
to
point
out
with
indignation
that
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
movement
had
been
hurt
in
the
ankle
in
the
course
of
the
great
civil
war
he
only
laughed
briefly
the
echo
of
his
own
voice
frightened
him
and
its
cackle
died
swiftly
away
in
the
grave
black
silence
it
sounded
like
a
blasphemy
and
he
told
himself
excusingly
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
help
it
with
rest
and
cessation
of
movement
his
brain
worked
more
easily
and
with
the
passing
of
his
first
savage
hunger
he
was
no
longer
preoccupied
with
the
needs
of
his
empty
stomach
he
considered
the
situation
dispassionately
and
curiously
detached
from
it
deciding
with
an
odd
lack
of
emotion
that
could
not
be
as
whatever
the
need
griselda
could
walk
no
further
he
for
his
part
was
incapable
of
dragging
her
when
the
light
came
they
must
just
sit
and
wait
his
mind
refused
to
trouble
itself
with
details
of
what
would
happen
if
they
sat
and
waited
too
long
looking
back
at
that
night
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
not
able
to
feel
very
much
his
capacity
for
emotion
was
exhausted
even
as
his
body
when
griselda
stirred
or
groaned
he
tried
to
shift
her
more
comfortably
when
she
gasped
for
water
he
helped
her
to
bend
down
and
drink
but
the
power
of
imaginative
terror
had
left
him
for
the
time
being
and
he
no
longer
trembled
and
sickened
at
her
suffering
as
he
had
done
when
she
was
first
struck
down
he
fell
into
a
doze
in
the
last
hours
of
night
and
when
his
eyes
opened
the
sky
was
a
pearly
grey
he
could
see
a
wide
stretch
of
it
over
the
for
at
the
spot
to
which
they
had
wandered
in
the
uncertainty
of
darkness
the
grouping
of
the
trees
was
less
close
than
it
had
been
and
there
was
a
suggestion
of
open
space
beyond
them
griselda
lay
sleeping
or
unconscious
with
her
knotted
hair
straying
on
her
face
he
smoothed
it
away
as
he
knelt
beside
her
took
her
hand
and
called
her
by
name
she
gave
no
answer
and
did
not
even
stir
when
he
kissed
her
the
power
of
imaginative
terror
had
returned
to
him
and
he
asked
himself
whether
she
were
dying
he
knelt
beside
her
for
a
few
minutes
fondling
her
hand
and
whispering
imploring
her
to
then
in
a
mingled
curse
and
appeal
stretched
his
arms
above
his
head
towards
heaven
the
effort
and
emotion
exhausted
him
he
collapsed
both
bodily
and
mentally
slipped
back
to
the
grass
beside
his
wife
and
lay
with
his
face
to
the
ground
what
roused
him
was
the
sound
of
a
man
s
voice
near
him
not
words
but
a
grunt
of
surprise
unmistakably
human
he
lifted
his
head
and
saw
gazing
at
him
from
the
opposite
bank
of
the
brook
the
man
who
had
uttered
the
grunt
a
man
carrying
a
pail
very
filthy
and
many
days
unshorn
with
a
peaked
cap
flattened
on
the
back
of
his
head
a
dark
muddied
coat
and
loose
trousers
that
had
once
been
red
his
face
for
all
its
grime
and
its
black
sprouts
of
beard
was
reassuring
in
its
interest
what
he
said
was
gibberish
to
william
s
ears
but
the
sound
of
it
kindly
and
inquiring
and
when
william
shook
his
head
and
pointed
to
his
wife
he
set
down
his
unfilled
pail
on
the
grass
and
waded
across
the
shallow
stream
he
looked
at
griselda
touched
her
torpid
hand
gently
and
muttered
more
friendly
gibberish
finishing
by
a
pat
on
william
s
shoulder
before
he
waded
back
to
the
further
bank
filled
his
pail
to
the
brim
and
walked
away
with
it
he
turned
to
fling
back
a
last
gesture
of
promise
before
he
vanished
among
the
trees
leaving
william
to
stare
after
him
motionless
and
dumb
and
waiting
for
something
he
knew
not
what
to
happen
what
happened
after
an
interval
was
the
reappearance
of
the
this
time
minus
his
pail
but
accompanied
in
its
stead
by
a
comrade
the
comrade
was
scarcely
less
filthy
and
similarly
clad
the
twain
emerged
from
between
the
trees
splashed
across
the
brook
and
exchanged
rapid
gibberish
while
they
stood
and
looked
down
at
griselda
finally
one
of
them
addressing
himself
to
william
pointed
to
somewhere
on
the
opposite
bank
and
nodded
with
intent
to
encourage
whereupon
the
pair
of
them
lifted
griselda
made
a
seat
of
their
arms
and
carried
her
william
followed
them
lurching
from
weakness
as
he
walked
and
after
they
had
gone
about
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
the
little
procession
came
out
on
to
a
highway
where
a
hooded
car
as
dirty
as
its
guardians
was
drawn
up
at
the
side
of
the
road
on
the
floor
of
the
car
the
two
men
placed
griselda
laying
her
down
gently
and
arranging
with
kind
dirty
hands
some
empty
sacks
as
a
makeshift
couch
and
a
coat
as
a
makeshift
pillow
that
done
they
signed
to
william
to
climb
in
beside
his
wife
and
one
of
them
noticing
his
feebleness
lent
a
hand
to
him
over
the
tailboard
while
the
other
provided
him
with
a
hunk
of
bread
and
a
large
tin
mug
of
red
wine
his
hunger
returned
with
the
taste
of
food
and
he
ate
with
a
ravenous
enjoyment
gulping
down
bread
and
wine
together
before
he
had
finished
gulping
the
car
had
started
and
was
rattling
over
the
road
he
knew
not
whither
woods
went
by
them
and
open
spaces
they
spanned
rivers
climbed
hills
and
descended
again
into
valleys
sometimes
the
roads
were
rough
and
at
the
jolting
of
the
car
griselda
would
whimper
and
cry
william
would
try
to
soothe
her
with
assurance
that
the
worst
was
over
they
were
safe
and
would
soon
be
in
comfort
he
did
not
know
if
she
understood
she
never
spoke
coherently
and
hardly
ever
opened
her
eyes
for
the
first
wooded
mile
or
two
they
had
the
road
to
themselves
after
that
they
came
across
other
traffic
the
greater
part
of
it
heading
in
the
same
mostly
southerly
direction
it
was
varied
traffic
mechanical
horse
and
foot
guns
and
other
cars
some
signed
with
the
geneva
cross
now
a
cavalry
patrol
now
a
dusty
detachment
of
infantry
and
intermingled
with
soldier
stragglers
little
groups
of
wayfarers
in
carts
and
tramping
afoot
all
these
grew
more
frequent
as
the
miles
went
under
them
so
frequent
as
to
hinder
their
progress
and
finally
when
they
neared
their
destination
bring
the
pace
of
the
car
to
a
crawl
their
never
knew
its
a
village
whereof
the
one
long
street
was
crowded
with
the
traffic
of
humanity
the
same
kind
of
traffic
they
had
passed
on
the
road
but
thickened
and
impeded
by
much
that
was
stationary
in
horses
in
men
and
in
vehicles
the
car
jolted
along
the
street
and
came
to
a
standstill
in
the
company
of
three
or
four
others
its
guardians
descended
and
one
of
over
the
tail
and
nodded
in
to
william
before
he
hurried
away
there
was
a
few
minutes
wait
during
which
nothing
personal
the
confused
sound
of
voices
the
confused
sound
of
movement
flowing
incessantly
movement
of
feet
wheels
and
engines
and
then
the
man
who
had
nodded
from
the
tail
of
the
car
came
back
others
with
soldiers
like
unto
himself
one
of
these
spoke
to
william
choosing
his
words
with
precision
and
when
he
shook
his
head
and
answered
i
am
english
there
was
talk
and
much
gesticulation
it
struck
him
later
that
they
took
him
for
a
belgian
and
perhaps
had
tried
him
with
a
word
or
two
of
the
language
to
the
accompaniment
of
talk
and
gesticulation
the
tailboard
of
the
car
was
let
down
and
william
by
sign
was
invited
to
set
foot
on
the
ground
whereafter
griselda
was
also
lifted
out
and
laid
by
the
roadside
on
a
truss
of
hay
which
some
one
had
procured
for
the
purpose
there
she
lay
for
another
ten
minutes
or
so
unaware
of
her
surroundings
while
the
stream
of
humanity
flowed
by
hunched
beside
her
on
the
hay
wondering
dumbly
what
would
happen
to
them
next
he
knew
himself
among
friends
and
was
no
longer
afraid
but
all
initiative
had
left
him
all
power
of
action
and
idea
he
had
a
dull
hope
that
some
one
was
bringing
a
doctor
meanwhile
he
could
do
nothing
but
wait
and
obey
and
when
his
good
samaritan
the
filthy
little
soldier
came
back
and
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
he
rose
passively
responsive
the
man
signed
to
him
that
they
should
lift
griselda
between
them
he
obeyed
with
infinite
difficulty
panting
at
the
effort
and
together
they
carried
her
some
yards
down
the
street
to
a
cart
that
stood
pulled
up
and
long
most
country
cart
with
a
man
perched
in
front
and
inside
two
women
many
bundles
some
ducks
and
a
goat
one
of
the
women
was
shrivelled
and
helpless
with
years
her
head
in
a
handkerchief
and
her
gnarled
fingers
holding
to
her
knees
she
sat
huddled
against
the
protesting
goat
a
lump
of
bent
old
age
her
companion
in
her
a
stout
elderly
peasant
woman
the
counterpart
in
petticoats
of
the
man
who
guided
a
solid
grey
farmhorse
she
made
room
for
griselda
talking
rapidly
the
while
in
the
straw
at
the
bottom
of
the
ducks
and
bundles
to
one
side
of
the
vehicle
with
her
knotted
and
energetic
hands
perhaps
she
was
striving
to
explain
to
william
that
it
was
impossible
to
accommodate
another
passenger
and
that
he
must
follow
on
foot
she
may
have
been
friend
or
acquaintance
of
the
dirty
samaritan
for
as
the
cart
moved
off
at
a
foot
s
pace
she
waved
to
him
in
friendly
guise
the
dirty
samaritan
for
his
part
clapping
william
on
the
back
pointing
after
the
cart
and
showing
his
teeth
in
a
final
grin
of
encouragement
in
the
days
that
followed
william
often
regretted
that
he
had
not
known
how
to
thank
him
for
the
bounty
of
his
overflowing
charity
he
walked
after
the
cart
as
it
lumbered
through
the
village
and
out
of
it
nourishment
and
the
sense
of
relief
had
given
back
some
of
his
strength
thus
he
was
able
if
with
difficulty
to
keep
up
with
the
plodding
of
the
solid
grey
brought
to
a
standstill
moreover
by
the
traffic
that
cumbered
the
road
sometimes
the
standstill
was
a
long
one
accompanied
by
confusion
and
shouting
there
was
a
point
where
a
stream
of
fugitives
flowing
southward
met
reinforcements
hurrying
a
flock
of
sheep
caught
between
the
two
charged
backwards
and
forwards
to
the
yells
of
their
sweating
drivers
and
the
anger
of
a
captain
of
cavalry
at
almost
every
the
stream
was
swollen
by
a
fresh
rivulet
of
human
and
animal
thus
at
such
junctions
the
pace
was
slower
and
a
halt
frequently
called
for
when
it
came
william
dropped
down
with
thankfulness
sometimes
lying
torpid
till
the
cart
moved
on
sometimes
satisfying
hunger
and
quenching
thirst
with
fruit
from
the
regiments
of
orchard
trees
that
lined
the
sides
of
the
road
the
stout
peasant
woman
was
more
kindly
than
a
hard
face
promised
she
was
careful
and
troubled
about
many
old
wreck
of
humanity
her
the
safety
of
herself
and
her
she
had
lost
her
home
and
her
livelihood
but
she
found
time
to
think
of
griselda
and
do
what
she
could
for
her
she
arranged
her
straw
pillow
wiped
the
dust
from
her
face
and
from
time
to
time
raised
her
that
she
might
hold
a
cup
to
her
lips
somewhere
about
midday
she
attended
to
the
general
needs
the
cart
was
halted
and
she
doled
out
a
ration
all
of
bread
chopped
from
a
yard
of
loaf
and
portions
of
a
cheese
william
was
not
forgotten
and
shared
with
the
rest
of
the
party
they
ate
with
the
cart
drawn
up
in
a
field
a
little
way
from
the
road
the
horse
grazing
the
goat
tethered
to
one
of
the
wheels
the
peasants
and
william
sitting
on
the
ground
and
griselda
lying
in
her
straw
william
climbed
up
beside
her
and
coaxed
a
little
wine
between
her
lips
she
had
swallowed
hardly
a
mouthful
when
she
turned
her
head
aside
and
pushed
the
mug
feebly
away
he
was
not
sure
if
she
responded
when
he
spoke
to
her
and
stroked
her
hand
she
muttered
once
or
twice
but
it
was
only
a
sound
to
his
ears
for
a
it
was
the
raw
red
wine
that
had
mounted
to
his
came
over
him
a
sort
of
irritation
at
her
long
and
persistent
silence
she
must
know
what
it
meant
to
see
her
suffer
and
have
no
word
he
felt
she
might
have
tried
to
rouse
herself
to
the
extent
of
one
little
smile
of
comfort
the
afternoon
was
as
the
weary
journeying
whereof
he
knew
not
the
goal
the
grey
horse
plodded
the
women
sat
hunched
amid
their
bundles
and
william
tramped
on
his
blistered
feet
at
the
tail
of
the
creaking
cart
when
he
looked
ahead
the
road
as
far
as
his
eye
could
reach
was
dotted
with
fugitive
tramps
and
fugitive
when
he
looked
back
there
were
others
following
in
their
tracks
for
the
most
part
however
he
looked
neither
back
nor
forward
but
trudged
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
through
the
whitened
grass
at
the
roadside
no
rain
had
fallen
for
many
days
and
the
road
was
deep
in
dust
it
hung
heavy
in
the
air
and
when
a
car
went
by
it
rose
in
clouds
like
smoke
the
trees
were
thick
with
it
and
every
man
s
garments
were
powdered
by
its
uniform
grey
more
than
once
their
way
led
them
through
a
might
have
been
always
the
same
village
so
alike
was
its
aspect
and
its
doings
always
some
of
the
houses
would
be
closed
and
some
in
the
act
of
emptying
in
each
and
all
was
the
same
scene
of
miserable
haste
of
loading
carts
of
families
scared
and
burdened
setting
out
on
their
flight
to
the
southward
it
was
a
scene
that
grew
so
familiar
to
william
that
staggering
with
the
weight
of
his
own
weariness
he
hardly
turned
his
head
to
watch
it
it
affected
him
only
by
the
halts
it
caused
by
the
need
of
manoeuvring
through
a
crowd
cut
off
from
his
fellows
by
the
lack
of
intelligible
speech
he
trudged
on
like
an
animal
at
the
tail
of
the
cart
ignorant
as
an
animal
of
what
the
next
hours
might
bring
him
there
were
moments
when
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
asleep
and
would
surely
waken
when
he
put
out
his
hand
to
touch
something
and
feel
that
it
resisted
and
was
dusty
axle
a
gate
a
wall
the
dusty
bark
of
a
and
there
were
other
moments
when
the
was
real
and
he
seemed
to
have
newly
wakened
from
the
dream
of
a
world
streets
and
stations
and
meals
that
came
regularly
of
life
that
was
decent
and
reasonable
and
orderly
with
men
like
unto
himself
late
in
the
afternoon
he
started
and
lifted
his
head
in
sudden
trembling
recognition
of
a
sound
reminiscent
and
because
reminiscent
whistle
of
a
passing
engine
the
clank
of
a
train
the
note
of
the
whistle
the
sight
of
a
long
line
of
a
field
away
behind
a
a
rush
of
hope
to
his
heart
and
a
rush
of
tears
to
his
eyes
his
soul
thrilled
with
the
promise
of
them
after
the
vagabond
horror
of
the
last
few
days
they
stood
for
decency
for
civilization
for
a
means
of
escape
from
hell
his
eyes
followed
the
train
with
longing
as
it
snorted
over
a
level
meadow
and
wound
out
of
sight
behind
a
it
with
longing
with
something
that
was
almost
love
a
mile
or
two
further
they
passed
a
level
crossing
and
soon
after
came
again
on
a
village
it
was
larger
than
any
they
had
so
far
traversed
and
in
ordinary
times
must
have
been
of
a
prosperous
importance
now
many
of
its
windows
were
bolted
and
shuttered
denoting
the
flight
of
inhabitants
whom
others
were
preparing
to
follow
the
sun
was
red
in
the
west
when
they
reached
its
outskirts
it
was
when
they
were
about
halfway
along
the
wide
paved
street
that
there
came
a
loud
cry
from
the
loud
and
so
sudden
that
the
driver
pulled
at
his
horse
the
cry
had
come
from
the
peasant
woman
who
was
leaning
over
griselda
the
life
in
william
stood
still
as
he
saw
her
face
and
she
had
to
beckon
to
him
twice
before
he
moved
to
climb
into
the
cart
she
gave
him
a
hand
as
he
climbed
and
half
jerked
him
over
the
bundles
griselda
had
died
very
quietly
in
the
straw
at
the
bottom
of
the
cart
some
one
he
thought
kept
him
back
from
the
body
while
they
lifted
it
down
from
the
cart
there
was
a
stir
and
bustle
and
three
or
four
people
gathered
round
hiding
it
for
a
moment
from
his
sight
one
he
remembered
had
the
goat
by
the
horns
and
was
trying
to
drag
it
aside
the
goat
was
refractory
kicked
and
bleated
and
made
itself
the
centre
of
a
scuffle
afterwards
he
pushed
through
them
all
and
stood
looking
down
at
his
wife
as
he
looked
at
with
glazed
eyes
and
fallen
swam
before
his
memory
a
pitiful
vision
of
the
dear
griselda
he
had
married
he
saw
huddle
of
rags
and
her
wedding
garments
fussed
and
dainty
with
her
bouquet
tied
with
suffragette
ribbons
he
remembered
the
expression
and
flushing
wherewith
she
had
given
her
hand
that
he
might
place
the
ring
on
her
finger
and
how
when
they
were
first
alone
as
man
and
wife
he
had
taken
the
hand
that
wore
the
ring
and
kissed
it
till
she
drew
it
away
the
crowd
in
the
little
house
at
balham
the
handshakes
the
were
all
so
close
and
so
present
that
they
gave
the
lie
to
this
dead
woman
dropped
by
the
roadside
he
looked
down
stupidly
while
the
bystanders
whispered
and
stared
he
did
not
know
how
long
he
sat
beside
her
nursing
a
dead
hand
in
his
own
but
he
knew
he
hated
and
shrank
from
the
people
around
group
that
kept
forming
and
moving
away
and
whispering
as
it
gazed
at
himself
and
the
body
of
his
wife
it
was
a
changing
little
crowd
never
more
than
a
dozen
or
so
men
and
women
who
stopped
in
their
passing
by
muttered
questions
heard
low
answers
looked
curious
or
pitying
and
moved
on
he
hated
its
inquisitiveness
he
shrank
from
its
pity
desiring
to
be
alone
with
his
dead
that
he
might
not
see
its
curious
and
pitying
faces
he
pressed
a
hand
over
his
eyes
after
some
minutes
or
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
that
stayed
till
he
moved
and
looked
up
he
who
had
touched
him
wore
the
garb
of
a
priest
was
stout
not
washed
or
brushed
but
kindly
of
manner
and
countenance
he
spoke
while
the
crowd
stared
and
listened
william
moved
his
head
irritably
muttered
i
can
t
understand
what
you
say
and
would
have
covered
his
eyes
again
if
he
had
not
heard
an
english
voice
beside
him
it
was
a
woman
who
had
caught
his
words
and
now
pushed
through
the
bystanders
a
tall
young
woman
in
tweed
coat
and
skirt
who
had
stayed
to
look
over
the
shoulders
of
the
shifting
group
you
are
english
she
said
what
has
happened
he
stared
up
at
her
for
a
moment
amazed
at
the
sound
of
his
own
tongue
my
wife
is
dead
he
told
her
and
hearing
himself
say
the
words
aloud
he
burst
into
a
passion
of
sobbing
through
it
he
choked
incoherent
appeals
to
take
them
god
s
sake
to
let
him
be
alone
he
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
and
wept
long
and
brokenly
as
one
who
has
nothing
more
to
hope
and
for
a
time
they
left
him
till
the
paroxysm
should
wear
itself
out
when
he
turned
his
head
at
last
the
crowd
that
he
hated
had
scattered
perhaps
the
priest
and
the
englishwoman
had
persuaded
it
away
for
they
were
the
only
two
near
him
the
englishwoman
with
her
hands
thrust
deep
into
the
pockets
of
her
tweed
coat
was
standing
at
his
shoulder
waiting
till
he
was
ready
to
listen
will
you
come
with
me
she
asked
it
will
be
better
her
tone
though
very
gentle
was
authoritative
and
brought
him
instinctively
to
his
feet
but
once
there
he
hesitated
to
follow
her
and
stammered
that
he
could
not
it
will
only
be
for
a
moment
the
will
will
bring
her
she
put
a
hand
on
his
arm
and
led
him
unresisting
down
the
hundred
yards
or
so
past
the
church
and
into
a
house
standing
back
from
the
road
in
a
garden
he
knew
afterwards
that
it
was
the
village
presbytery
and
that
the
little
woman
who
moved
aside
from
the
garden
gate
to
let
them
pass
in
was
the
priest
s
elderly
housekeeper
his
companion
spoke
to
her
in
french
no
doubt
to
explain
their
arrival
and
the
old
woman
trotted
ahead
to
the
house
opened
a
door
to
the
right
and
ushered
them
into
a
that
smelt
of
unopened
window
it
was
a
ceremonious
as
well
as
a
stuffy
little
room
there
were
good
books
lying
on
a
table
in
the
centre
and
stiff
chairs
ranged
against
the
walls
having
offered
them
a
couple
of
the
chairs
the
housekeeper
withdrew
to
her
vigil
at
the
garden
gate
william
sat
where
she
had
placed
him
but
the
englishwoman
walked
to
the
window
i
wish
i
could
help
you
she
said
with
her
back
towards
him
i
know
nothing
seems
any
good
at
such
a
time
but
if
there
is
anything
you
she
was
giving
him
more
than
she
knew
by
her
presence
by
speaking
in
their
common
tongue
the
sound
of
the
familiar
comprehensible
english
was
as
the
breaking
of
an
iron
barrier
between
him
and
the
rest
of
mankind
she
was
talking
to
not
mouthing
and
making
strange
noises
he
was
back
in
the
world
where
you
spoke
and
your
fellows
understood
you
where
you
were
an
animal
guided
by
nod
and
beck
or
driven
to
labour
by
blows
comprehensible
speech
meant
not
only
sympathy
but
the
power
of
the
pent
and
swollen
misery
of
his
last
few
days
was
relieved
by
a
torrent
of
words
she
stood
and
listened
while
he
sobbed
and
talked
incoherently
there
was
small
plan
or
sequence
about
his
went
backwards
and
forwards
in
it
started
afresh
and
left
gaps
but
she
realized
that
he
was
telling
it
not
for
her
benefit
but
for
his
own
relief
let
him
pour
himself
out
and
refrained
from
interruption
even
when
his
talk
was
most
entangled
she
took
it
as
a
good
sign
when
at
last
he
paused
and
looked
up
to
ask
of
her
what
it
all
meant
what
had
happened
and
where
he
was
now
she
told
him
as
briefly
as
might
be
what
heinz
had
told
a
world
in
upheaval
and
nations
at
grips
with
each
other
the
same
story
if
not
from
the
same
point
of
view
she
added
that
he
was
now
on
french
soil
which
he
had
not
guessed
some
miles
from
the
belgian
frontier
and
that
it
would
be
possible
she
hoped
to
make
the
journey
onward
by
rail
the
french
were
falling
back
and
the
district
had
been
warned
of
the
likelihood
of
enemy
occupation
she
supposed
that
the
needs
of
the
army
had
absorbed
the
local
for
there
had
been
no
passenger
train
on
their
small
branch
line
that
day
the
authorities
however
had
promised
one
to
paris
in
the
morning
and
she
herself
was
waiting
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
a
seat
she
hesitated
and
broke
off
at
the
sound
of
shuffling
feet
in
the
passage
feet
and
uncertain
as
of
men
who
carried
a
burden
william
heard
the
sound
likewise
and
guessing
its
meaning
would
have
risen
and
gone
to
the
door
but
she
kept
him
to
his
seat
with
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
he
obeyed
the
touch
because
at
the
moment
it
was
easier
to
obey
than
to
resist
he
sat
and
trembled
twisting
his
fingers
while
the
shuffling
died
away
into
momentary
silence
followed
by
trampling
and
the
closing
of
a
door
as
the
went
out
then
silence
again
a
much
longer
silence
till
the
stout
priest
entered
the
room
moving
quietly
as
men
are
accustomed
to
move
in
the
neighbourhood
of
those
whom
no
sound
can
arouse
or
disturb
he
spoke
softly
at
some
length
to
the
englishwoman
who
having
listened
and
nodded
turned
to
william
and
told
him
that
if
he
would
like
to
go
to
he
followed
the
priest
down
the
passage
to
a
room
at
the
back
of
the
house
wherein
on
a
table
and
covered
by
a
sheet
they
had
laid
the
body
of
his
wife
there
were
long
candles
burning
around
the
table
and
on
either
side
of
her
a
little
metal
vase
filled
with
roses
the
priest
stood
aside
in
the
doorway
for
william
to
enter
bowed
his
head
in
a
prayer
and
went
out
when
he
had
gone
william
crept
to
the
table
turned
the
sheet
from
her
face
and
looked
griselda
dowered
with
a
grave
dignity
that
had
never
been
hers
while
she
lived
some
one
had
washed
away
the
stains
of
the
road
and
arranged
the
disordered
rags
that
had
once
been
a
dress
the
hair
was
smoothed
out
of
its
tangle
and
her
poor
hands
crossed
on
her
breast
he
stayed
with
her
till
dusk
had
thickened
into
darkness
sometimes
standing
at
her
side
to
look
down
on
her
face
sometimes
bowed
to
his
knees
by
the
burden
of
the
years
without
her
when
the
priest
came
back
to
rouse
him
he
was
crouched
in
the
attitude
of
prayer
but
his
prayer
if
such
it
might
be
called
was
only
the
eternal
petition
of
the
bereaved
would
god
that
i
had
died
instead
the
village
sexton
was
of
those
who
had
already
fled
at
the
rumour
of
the
oncoming
german
so
that
night
the
englishwoman
who
had
acquired
in
a
garden
some
skill
in
the
handling
of
a
spade
took
turns
with
a
bent
old
peasant
in
digging
a
grave
for
griselda
when
daylight
failed
them
they
dug
by
the
shine
of
a
lantern
the
englishwoman
was
not
or
nervous
but
she
found
the
job
an
eerie
more
so
since
the
cemetery
like
french
graveyards
in
general
lay
well
away
from
its
she
was
glad
when
the
moment
came
to
pay
off
her
companion
and
return
to
her
quarters
in
the
little
hôtel
de
la
gare
other
formalities
in
connection
with
the
funeral
there
were
the
reason
that
the
maire
and
his
clerk
who
in
ordinary
seasons
would
have
devoted
much
time
and
stationery
to
the
subject
had
departed
that
evening
bearing
with
them
the
archives
of
the
commune
william
for
his
part
spent
the
night
on
the
priest
s
horsehair
sofa
next
door
to
the
room
where
the
candles
burned
around
the
body
of
his
wife
from
weariness
of
the
flesh
he
dozed
now
and
again
but
for
the
greater
part
of
the
night
lay
wakeful
and
staring
at
darkness
there
were
moments
when
the
horsehair
sofa
shook
beneath
his
sobbing
and
there
were
others
when
it
seemed
to
him
impossible
that
a
horror
so
brutal
and
so
undeserved
should
have
mangled
his
harmless
life
at
one
such
moment
he
crept
from
his
couch
felt
his
way
across
the
room
and
into
the
by
some
wild
and
unconfessed
thought
that
he
might
not
find
griselda
on
the
sheeted
table
with
her
hands
crossed
over
her
breast
the
door
when
he
tried
it
was
locked
and
the
key
by
the
priest
or
his
housekeeper
before
they
retired
for
the
night
but
when
he
knelt
down
to
peer
through
the
keyhole
he
could
see
two
of
the
tall
church
candles
and
the
vase
with
its
bunch
of
white
roses
that
some
one
had
placed
near
her
head
he
crept
back
knowing
that
she
lay
there
indeed
and
sat
down
to
stare
at
the
darkness
till
it
softened
from
black
into
grey
the
morning
was
still
flushed
in
the
east
when
the
old
woman
came
to
him
with
bread
and
a
bowl
of
coffee
the
coffee
was
hot
aromatic
and
sweet
after
the
fashion
of
that
which
had
once
been
brewed
by
madame
remembering
breakfasts
not
eaten
alone
his
tears
dropped
into
it
thickly
while
he
ate
sitting
humped
on
the
edge
of
the
horsehair
sofa
the
street
outside
was
already
astir
with
traffic
nomad
and
military
those
fugitives
who
had
rested
in
the
village
for
the
night
were
once
more
taking
to
the
road
other
fugitives
from
the
neighbourhood
were
dribbling
in
to
join
them
troops
were
moving
up
and
was
even
as
yesterday
when
he
had
finished
his
bread
and
coffee
the
old
woman
signed
him
to
the
kitchen
sink
where
she
furnished
him
with
soap
and
a
towel
and
the
process
of
washing
completed
she
produced
a
led
him
out
into
the
garden
and
attacked
with
vigour
the
mud
and
stain
on
his
garments
he
was
standing
passively
while
she
scoured
at
his
shoulders
when
the
englishwoman
came
up
and
looking
anywhere
except
at
his
face
put
his
wife
s
rings
into
his
hands
there
were
two
of
new
gold
band
with
a
month
s
wear
behind
it
and
the
little
engagement
at
sight
of
them
the
housekeeper
ceased
to
scour
and
crept
away
with
her
brush
he
looked
down
at
them
lying
in
his
palm
till
the
tears
veiled
them
and
knotted
them
slowly
and
tightly
in
a
corner
of
his
handkerchief
his
companion
cleared
her
throat
and
still
looking
anywhere
except
at
his
face
told
him
that
the
train
to
probably
the
last
one
to
be
starting
that
morning
yes
he
said
vaguely
conscious
that
she
expected
a
reply
she
explained
that
what
she
had
meant
was
the
funeral
must
take
place
immediately
chiefly
for
the
sake
of
breaking
the
silence
she
supposed
that
his
wife
was
not
a
roman
catholic
he
answered
no
staring
at
a
row
of
hollyhocks
and
a
butterfly
that
quivered
above
them
she
asked
she
explained
because
in
that
case
the
priest
would
have
read
the
proper
service
as
it
was
she
hoped
he
would
understand
that
they
had
done
their
best
reverent
but
there
were
many
of
the
tradesmen
were
leaving
or
had
left
already
carpenters
and
so
on
he
listened
stupidly
with
his
eyes
on
the
quivering
butterfly
dumbly
rebellious
at
the
cruelty
that
tore
him
even
from
the
it
only
dawned
on
him
what
she
meant
by
her
stumbling
hints
when
she
led
him
through
the
house
to
the
front
door
where
a
cart
stood
waiting
with
the
priest
at
the
horse
s
head
it
was
a
borrowed
by
the
priest
from
a
neighbour
and
on
the
floor
of
it
that
which
had
been
griselda
lay
coffinless
and
wrapped
in
a
sheet
there
were
roses
scattered
on
the
folds
of
the
sheet
and
the
old
frenchwoman
was
waiting
at
the
gate
with
a
shapeless
little
wreath
of
her
own
manufacture
which
she
pressed
into
william
s
hand
they
set
out
a
funeral
procession
of
three
which
at
other
times
would
have
drawn
many
curious
glances
the
priest
leading
the
horse
and
william
and
the
englishwoman
walking
side
by
side
at
the
rear
of
the
cart
the
cemetery
lay
outside
the
village
a
or
so
from
their
and
they
passed
wayfarers
enough
on
the
road
of
whom
some
bared
their
heads
and
crossed
themselves
and
others
were
too
busy
with
their
own
sorrows
to
give
even
a
thought
to
the
dead
the
gate
of
the
graveyard
was
narrow
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
the
cart
was
manoeuvred
between
its
posts
at
an
ordinary
funeral
the
hearse
would
have
remained
in
the
road
but
this
was
no
ordinary
funeral
nor
ordinary
day
and
it
was
as
well
not
to
tempt
the
footsore
fugitive
by
the
sight
of
a
vehicle
unguarded
accordingly
the
cart
was
manoeuvred
through
the
gate
before
the
priest
william
and
the
englishwoman
lifted
out
the
body
of
griselda
and
carried
it
to
the
grave
in
the
corner
the
old
labourer
was
sitting
beside
it
on
the
mound
that
would
shortly
fill
it
he
rose
when
he
saw
them
leaning
on
his
spade
and
bared
his
grey
hairs
to
the
dead
the
grave
was
shallow
as
it
was
the
body
being
coffinless
was
lowered
with
difficulty
and
the
englishwoman
led
william
a
little
way
aside
that
he
might
not
watch
while
the
priest
and
the
peasant
performed
the
last
service
griselda
would
require
of
man
he
understood
what
she
meant
and
stood
with
his
back
to
the
group
round
the
grave
staring
at
a
granite
tombstone
bedizened
with
massive
bead
wreaths
when
she
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
as
sign
that
he
might
turn
the
priest
was
crossing
himself
at
his
prayers
and
the
old
man
standing
by
the
heap
of
new
turned
earth
he
went
to
the
edge
of
the
grave
looked
down
at
the
crumpled
sheet
and
then
stupidly
round
at
his
neighbour
he
said
nothing
but
she
thought
he
was
expecting
something
so
as
the
priest
still
prayed
with
closed
eyes
in
silence
she
struggled
with
the
racial
shyness
where
things
of
the
spirit
are
concerned
and
swallowing
her
tears
spoke
the
funeral
words
for
griselda
i
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
saith
the
lord
he
that
believeth
in
me
though
he
were
dead
yet
shall
he
live
blessed
are
the
dead
that
die
in
the
lord
they
rest
from
their
labours
man
that
is
born
of
woman
hath
but
a
short
time
to
live
he
cometh
up
and
is
cut
down
lord
have
mercy
upon
us
it
was
all
she
could
remember
and
when
william
had
whispered
amen
they
left
the
old
peasant
to
his
work
at
the
gate
of
the
cemetery
they
parted
from
the
priest
who
had
charged
himself
with
the
immediate
return
of
the
haycart
which
he
had
borrowed
from
a
neighbouring
farm
he
shook
hands
with
them
nodded
kindly
to
the
englishwoman
s
thanks
climbed
into
the
cart
and
drove
off
along
the
dusty
road
they
saw
him
no
more
and
often
wondered
what
became
of
him
when
the
wave
of
teutonic
invasion
swept
over
his
parish
and
himself
their
own
way
lay
in
the
opposite
back
to
the
village
inn
where
the
englishwoman
picked
up
her
bag
and
a
package
of
provisions
for
the
journey
and
then
on
to
the
station
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
train
william
followed
her
incuriously
without
question
or
comment
and
when
she
broke
silence
to
explain
what
they
were
doing
he
assented
speaking
with
an
effort
and
hardly
knowing
to
what
he
assented
the
train
to
paris
had
been
announced
by
the
station
authorities
for
an
early
hour
in
the
morning
but
morning
dragged
on
and
became
afternoon
before
it
put
in
an
appearance
they
waited
through
long
and
shadeless
two
o
clock
and
the
most
insignificant
of
railway
stations
with
a
crowd
of
passengers
a
crowd
that
swelled
as
the
hours
crawled
on
until
it
flowed
from
the
platform
far
along
the
line
and
it
seemed
doubtful
if
any
train
however
capacious
could
absorb
its
swarming
multitude
it
sat
in
families
about
the
platform
and
camped
and
shifted
as
an
untidy
fringe
to
the
track
it
was
querulous
weeping
was
also
in
patches
malodorous
at
midday
it
picknicked
squalidly
enough
out
of
bottles
and
bulging
handkerchiefs
finding
momentary
distraction
in
the
process
for
the
rest
it
had
nothing
to
do
but
exchange
its
miseries
stare
at
the
curve
which
the
train
must
round
listen
uneasily
to
the
echo
of
artillery
and
assail
the
with
complaining
queries
whenever
he
dared
to
show
his
face
for
the
most
part
that
hapless
and
harried
subordinates
had
been
reft
from
him
by
mobilization
and
who
was
only
too
conscious
that
his
was
a
snare
and
a
low
in
his
miniature
office
whence
he
peered
out
now
and
again
to
make
anxious
estimate
of
the
numbers
that
blackened
and
overflowed
his
platform
as
time
went
on
and
the
throng
grew
denser
he
gave
up
his
attempts
to
reconcile
the
extent
of
the
crowd
with
the
cubic
capacity
of
a
highly
problematical
train
and
retiring
to
his
sanctum
in
despair
and
for
good
locked
the
door
on
intrusion
and
complaint
happened
not
once
but
engine
was
sighted
rounding
the
curve
to
the
northward
there
was
instant
bustle
and
expectation
on
the
part
of
the
waiting
multitude
makeshift
luggage
was
collected
and
clutched
at
mothers
screamed
to
their
straying
young
families
and
herded
them
together
in
anxious
preparation
for
the
formidable
struggle
ahead
but
not
once
but
often
the
alarm
was
a
false
one
the
preparations
in
vain
as
the
train
sped
by
without
halt
the
first
to
run
past
was
a
red
cross
train
with
bandaged
men
showing
at
the
windows
as
it
slid
between
the
platforms
the
crowd
buzzed
its
disappointment
and
the
exception
of
some
few
determined
souls
who
vented
their
annoyance
in
raps
on
the
s
down
in
dejection
to
continue
its
weary
waiting
another
of
sweltering
impatience
and
again
the
mothers
screamed
and
rounded
up
their
families
with
the
same
result
as
before
this
time
the
relentless
and
undelaying
train
was
packed
not
with
wounded
soldiers
but
with
refugees
from
higher
up
the
unto
themselves
but
more
fortunate
it
was
packed
to
the
doors
and
beyond
the
men
were
hanging
on
the
footboards
for
many
reasons
william
and
his
guardian
avoided
the
platform
where
the
crowd
was
thickest
and
sat
under
the
hedge
by
the
line
during
the
first
hour
or
two
of
their
weary
sojourn
she
judged
him
past
rousing
and
left
him
to
his
own
thoughts
and
he
sat
by
her
side
with
his
hands
hugging
his
knees
and
seemingly
unconscious
of
her
presence
later
about
midday
when
she
fed
him
from
the
store
of
provisions
she
had
brought
for
the
journey
she
essayed
to
rouse
him
by
telling
him
how
she
had
come
there
and
who
she
was
her
name
was
haynes
edith
haynes
she
had
been
some
weeks
in
the
neighbourhood
staying
in
the
country
house
of
some
distant
french
cousins
they
had
been
warned
soon
after
hostilities
broke
out
that
proximity
to
the
frontier
might
be
dangerous
but
had
been
unable
to
leave
owing
to
the
illness
of
one
of
the
family
yesterday
the
invalid
partially
recovered
had
been
got
off
with
her
mother
in
a
car
procured
with
difficulty
as
it
had
other
occupants
and
could
not
carry
the
whole
party
volunteered
to
remain
behind
and
follow
to
paris
by
rail
william
listened
occasionally
nodding
to
show
that
he
listened
in
a
way
he
was
grateful
for
her
presence
but
nothing
seemed
to
matter
and
seeing
that
it
was
as
yet
too
early
to
help
him
to
other
thoughts
she
left
him
again
to
his
silence
it
was
after
two
when
a
nearing
train
slowed
down
as
it
reached
the
down
and
came
to
a
standstill
to
a
tumult
of
pushing
and
shouting
it
was
a
train
of
more
than
ordinary
couple
of
engines
to
an
interminable
line
of
carriages
and
long
as
it
was
it
was
none
too
long
for
the
needs
of
the
passengers
vans
and
carriages
alike
were
already
well
stocked
with
humanity
but
the
other
humanity
on
the
platform
rendered
desperate
by
its
waiting
hurled
itself
at
the
doors
and
pressed
and
fought
a
way
in
the
sight
was
not
was
trampling
expostulation
threats
the
angry
frightened
crowd
was
past
minding
its
manners
and
at
times
the
rush
for
the
doors
was
carried
on
almost
with
savagery
women
were
buffeted
children
swept
away
in
the
press
william
and
his
was
the
sturdier
as
well
as
the
taller
of
the
up
the
steps
of
a
covered
truck
and
were
thrust
through
its
opening
by
the
weight
of
those
pressing
behind
them
the
truck
when
they
gained
it
was
close
and
crowded
so
crowded
that
many
had
to
keep
their
feet
for
lack
of
the
floor
space
to
sit
when
the
struggle
for
places
was
it
was
not
over
train
was
packed
end
to
end
with
sweating
and
exhausted
travellers
there
followed
a
journey
that
to
those
who
endured
it
seemed
endless
a
crawl
punctuated
with
halts
the
halts
were
lengthy
as
well
as
frequent
sometimes
in
sidings
where
refugees
perforce
gave
place
to
troop
trains
sometimes
in
junctions
where
they
pulled
up
indefinitely
at
a
platform
and
where
officials
could
give
no
information
as
to
when
a
fresh
start
would
be
made
the
waits
wearisome
as
they
were
were
by
far
more
endurable
than
the
wretched
stages
in
between
which
were
stages
of
sweating
heat
and
smells
of
stifling
and
cramped
discomfort
on
the
platform
at
least
it
was
possible
to
stretch
and
breathe
in
the
vans
it
was
aching
backs
and
bones
and
a
foulness
that
thickened
with
the
miles
children
wept
and
sickened
as
the
hours
crawled
by
and
all
through
the
darkness
their
crying
was
never
stilled
as
wretched
little
wailing
or
angry
howl
it
mingled
always
with
the
throb
and
clank
of
the
train
the
delicate
chill
of
morning
was
as
nectar
after
the
stench
of
the
crowded
night
by
special
mercy
just
as
dawn
broke
they
drew
up
in
a
siding
with
fields
to
the
right
and
left
of
them
neither
william
nor
his
friend
was
asleep
when
the
train
stopped
and
crawling
over
recumbent
bodies
on
the
floor
of
the
van
they
dropped
down
stiffly
from
their
pen
and
stood
breathing
in
the
clean
cool
wind
with
their
damp
clothes
sticking
to
their
heated
bodies
they
sucked
the
air
into
their
william
blind
with
his
misery
conscious
of
the
calm
loveliness
of
morning
on
stretches
of
green
after
the
reek
of
the
van
his
companion
shuddering
at
the
sight
of
her
hands
went
in
search
of
water
and
discovered
a
tap
on
the
platform
whereat
william
in
his
turn
drank
thirstily
and
soused
hands
and
face
before
they
settled
down
in
a
field
at
the
side
of
the
line
there
on
the
good
green
turf
they
shared
the
last
remnants
of
their
package
of
food
some
bread
and
an
apple
apiece
for
all
the
hours
they
had
spent
on
the
train
they
had
accomplished
only
some
half
of
the
distance
to
paris
and
as
refreshment
or
cleared
out
by
the
no
longer
be
counted
on
to
supply
the
needs
of
the
traveller
they
had
little
prospect
of
further
sustenance
till
they
reached
their
journey
s
end
they
ate
their
small
meal
sitting
as
far
as
they
deemed
safe
from
the
train
and
the
crowd
it
had
it
in
silence
for
william
had
not
yet
found
speech
his
world
for
the
time
being
was
formless
and
void
and
as
such
incapable
of
expression
all
day
they
travelled
as
they
had
travelled
on
the
day
before
in
jolted
crowds
in
squalor
in
heat
to
the
sound
of
the
misery
of
children
they
ached
they
wearied
they
sweated
they
halted
and
lurched
on
again
too
wearied
even
for
impatience
they
endured
without
complaint
until
even
the
children
were
past
crying
the
sun
was
low
on
the
horizon
when
william
drowsily
stupid
raised
his
head
from
his
knees
as
his
friend
touched
him
on
the
arm
he
looked
up
train
was
plodding
through
forest
he
had
ceased
to
hope
for
the
journey
s
end
and
sat
for
the
most
part
with
his
head
on
his
knees
in
a
dull
resignation
if
we
don
t
stop
again
she
told
him
we
ought
to
be
in
fairly
soon
i
think
that
s
chantilly
we
ve
run
through
we
re
only
half
an
hour
from
ordinary
times
that
s
to
say
the
times
were
not
ordinary
and
they
took
more
than
half
an
much
get
over
the
twenty
odd
miles
they
slowed
to
a
crawl
for
the
last
stretch
of
the
journey
and
outside
paris
between
paris
and
denis
they
halted
and
waited
till
well
after
night
had
fallen
but
at
long
last
the
interminable
wait
was
ended
and
they
creaked
and
crept
forward
to
a
platform
of
the
gare
du
william
for
the
first
time
set
foot
in
the
capital
of
france
as
he
did
so
he
remembered
a
fact
that
had
hitherto
slipped
his
heinz
and
his
companions
when
they
took
his
had
left
him
without
a
penny
so
far
the
loss
of
his
purse
had
not
troubled
him
he
had
lived
as
the
beasts
live
and
been
cared
for
even
as
they
but
paris
was
civilization
where
money
would
be
needed
for
a
lodging
he
had
no
resource
but
his
companion
and
as
they
drifted
along
with
the
mass
on
the
platform
he
appealed
perforce
to
her
i
m
afraid
he
stammered
i
ve
got
no
money
they
took
it
away
from
germans
she
reassured
him
briskly
with
don
t
worry
about
ve
got
plenty
i
ll
settle
the
hotel
and
the
can
pay
me
when
we
get
back
to
london
stick
close
to
me
whatever
you
do
if
i
once
lose
you
in
this
crowd
i
shall
never
find
you
again
he
replied
with
a
mutter
of
thanks
and
obeying
her
injunction
to
stick
close
was
crushed
in
her
wake
past
the
barrier
at
the
end
of
the
platform
past
the
heated
officials
who
were
striving
to
deal
with
the
needs
of
the
influx
of
refugees
and
finally
out
of
the
station
there
in
the
open
space
before
the
gare
du
nord
he
stepped
back
suddenly
from
the
world
of
nightmare
into
the
world
as
he
had
always
known
it
the
wide
lit
street
in
front
of
the
station
was
filled
with
a
moving
and
everyday
crowd
in
his
ears
were
the
buzz
of
the
taxi
and
the
warning
clang
of
the
tram
the
change
from
the
horrible
to
normal
brutality
and
foulness
to
the
order
of
a
great
so
sudden
and
complete
that
it
took
away
his
breath
like
a
swift
plunge
into
cold
water
and
as
the
life
of
the
city
enwrapped
him
and
claimed
him
for
its
own
for
one
crazy
moment
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
last
few
days
were
impossible
their
fantastic
cruelty
was
something
that
could
not
have
been
and
he
almost
looked
round
for
griselda
edith
haynes
knew
her
way
about
paris
and
the
little
hotel
in
a
quiet
where
a
taxi
deposited
herself
and
her
companion
was
one
that
had
sheltered
her
in
days
less
eventful
and
strenuous
and
where
madame
in
consequence
was
compassionate
and
not
contemptuous
at
being
asked
to
shelter
two
late
arrivals
in
the
last
stage
of
dirt
and
untidiness
william
before
he
sat
down
to
eat
had
exchanged
his
torn
garments
for
the
suit
of
an
absent
son
called
up
on
the
first
day
of
mobilization
and
for
all
his
ache
and
dull
stupor
of
sorrow
he
knew
something
of
the
blessing
of
bodily
relief
when
he
washed
in
hot
water
and
was
clean
he
had
had
no
real
sleep
since
the
night
before
griselda
died
now
the
need
for
it
came
down
on
him
like
a
heavy
cloud
and
great
as
was
also
his
need
for
food
he
could
hardly
keep
his
eyes
open
through
supper
when
he
woke
next
morning
it
was
nearing
midday
and
he
had
more
than
slept
the
clock
round
he
pressed
the
bell
as
he
had
been
told
to
do
when
he
woke
and
with
the
coffee
and
rolls
that
arrived
at
the
summons
came
a
pencilled
note
from
his
mentor
she
had
gone
out
to
look
up
her
relatives
and
also
to
inquire
about
the
time
and
manner
of
the
journey
from
paris
to
london
she
wrote
that
she
might
not
be
back
at
the
hotel
for
some
hours
but
the
envelope
that
enclosed
her
communication
enclosed
likewise
a
tactfully
proffered
loan
for
the
immediate
needs
of
her
s
wardrobe
but
for
the
reminder
it
would
have
hardly
occurred
to
him
that
his
wardrobe
was
in
need
of
renewal
he
had
grown
so
accustomed
in
the
last
long
days
to
being
ordered
guided
or
driven
that
he
had
lost
the
habit
of
directing
his
own
doings
as
it
was
he
breakfasted
dressed
himself
again
in
the
suit
of
madame
s
absent
son
and
was
instructed
by
madame
herself
where
to
find
a
barber
for
an
overdue
shave
and
an
outfitter
capable
of
english
thither
he
went
made
his
purchases
mechanically
and
returned
to
the
hotel
with
his
new
suit
of
black
in
a
parcel
it
seemed
to
him
as
he
walked
the
paris
streets
as
he
bought
and
paid
and
spoke
of
things
that
did
not
matter
that
his
sense
of
loss
and
his
longing
for
griselda
was
stronger
even
than
in
the
first
hours
after
her
death
it
was
accentuated
by
his
contact
with
the
civilized
the
normal
by
the
sights
and
sounds
of
the
everyday
world
to
which
griselda
belonged
she
had
had
no
place
in
the
strange
french
village
where
she
died
no
place
in
the
misery
and
dirt
of
the
crowded
truck
but
here
where
life
to
all
seeming
was
as
usual
where
the
streets
were
like
enough
to
english
streets
to
produce
after
country
solitude
and
the
savagery
of
bloodshed
the
illusion
of
dear
familiarity
here
she
should
have
walked
with
her
arm
in
his
here
she
would
have
chatted
have
gazed
in
shop
windows
and
bargained
and
long
years
faced
him
with
their
deadly
never
as
he
went
his
way
without
her
later
when
he
had
returned
to
the
hotel
and
changed
into
his
new
black
suit
a
wild
fit
of
useless
rage
came
over
alone
in
his
bedroom
he
cursed
the
devils
who
had
killed
his
wife
the
devils
who
had
made
the
war
under
his
breath
lest
he
should
be
heard
in
the
corridor
he
called
down
the
vengeance
of
god
on
their
evil
heads
breaking
inevitably
as
his
own
store
of
invective
gave
out
into
lyrical
reminiscence
of
that
biblical
lore
with
which
his
mother
had
imbued
him
through
sunday
after
sunday
of
his
childhood
believing
in
the
god
whose
existence
he
had
usually
ignored
and
often
doubted
because
of
his
need
of
an
avenger
and
a
present
help
in
his
trouble
in
that
moment
the
god
whom
he
it
may
be
the
lord
god
of
hosts
the
mighty
one
of
israel
who
was
wont
to
strike
the
wicked
and
spare
not
and
the
desire
of
his
shaken
and
rebellious
soul
was
even
as
the
desire
of
him
who
sang
out
his
hatred
by
the
alien
waters
of
babylon
the
hotel
chambermaid
put
an
end
to
his
whispered
prayer
and
anathema
by
tapping
on
the
door
to
inform
him
that
lunch
was
waiting
on
the
table
edith
haynes
when
she
returned
in
the
late
afternoon
with
news
that
the
journey
could
be
made
on
the
following
day
by
way
of
dieppe
and
folkestone
found
him
clad
in
his
mourning
for
griselda
and
poring
over
english
newspapers
his
eyes
were
still
haggard
and
moved
her
to
pity
but
she
took
it
as
a
good
sign
that
his
stupor
of
grief
had
passed
and
that
he
had
begun
as
his
first
question
told
her
to
feel
a
need
for
more
information
which
might
bridge
the
month
s
gap
in
his
knowledge
of
the
outer
world
she
gave
him
with
such
detail
as
she
had
in
her
possession
the
story
of
the
outbreak
of
war
and
the
causes
thereof
and
from
her
he
learned
for
the
first
time
of
the
ultimatum
to
servia
and
the
tension
thereby
created
of
the
political
consequences
of
the
invasion
of
belgium
and
the
feverish
days
of
hesitation
in
england
that
had
ended
on
the
fourth
of
august
with
the
formal
declaration
of
war
he
listened
sometimes
puzzled
but
always
intent
from
time
to
time
putting
a
question
that
revealed
his
blank
ignorance
of
the
network
of
european
politics
to
which
she
replied
as
clearly
as
she
could
showing
him
maps
and
talking
on
in
the
hope
of
distracting
him
from
the
thoughts
behind
his
haggard
eyes
by
degrees
she
gleaned
from
his
hesitating
queries
and
disconnected
comments
some
understanding
not
only
of
his
profound
ignorance
of
the
forces
that
had
brought
about
the
war
but
of
the
upheaval
of
his
mind
and
soul
which
was
the
direct
and
inevitable
consequence
of
the
loss
of
his
former
faith
once
or
twice
as
they
talked
he
quoted
her
scraps
and
jerks
of
faraday
from
orators
of
the
trades
union
congress
from
a
speech
of
philip
snowden
s
in
parliament
urging
the
reduction
of
the
she
saw
that
he
was
trying
to
justify
to
himself
his
attitude
and
creed
of
yesterday
in
the
midst
of
a
quotation
from
faraday
on
the
general
strike
as
a
certain
preventive
of
war
he
broke
off
suddenly
to
appeal
to
her
with
every
one
thought
he
was
right
he
seemed
so
sure
i
didn
t
see
how
he
could
be
wrong
she
noticed
that
wherever
their
talk
might
stray
he
came
back
time
and
again
to
his
central
the
blankly
impossible
had
happened
and
the
jest
was
a
brutal
truth
that
in
the
beginning
was
all
his
mind
had
laid
hold
of
now
the
first
stage
of
amazement
over
he
was
groping
instinctively
and
perhaps
unconsciously
after
rights
and
wrongs
of
quarrel
and
striving
to
understand
how
the
impossible
had
come
into
existence
edith
haynes
had
not
passed
her
life
in
the
atmosphere
of
internationalism
and
would
have
been
more
than
human
had
she
been
an
impartial
guide
to
him
where
the
causes
of
war
were
as
he
would
have
been
more
than
human
had
he
been
capable
of
impartial
guidance
what
he
lacked
in
patriotism
he
made
up
in
personal
suffering
he
hated
the
german
because
he
had
been
robbed
of
his
wife
and
it
added
but
little
to
the
fire
of
his
hatred
to
learn
of
faith
broken
with
belgium
if
he
listened
intently
when
she
told
of
it
if
he
pored
over
newspaper
paragraphs
dealing
with
german
cruelty
to
the
conquered
it
was
because
they
fitted
with
his
mood
and
justified
the
loathing
in
his
soul
it
was
his
persistent
poring
over
english
newspapers
that
brought
him
in
the
end
the
salvation
of
a
definite
purpose
an
article
in
daily
days
the
beginning
of
the
recruiting
campaign
for
the
raising
of
kitchener
s
army
he
read
it
as
he
read
everything
else
that
explained
or
described
the
war
at
first
the
article
was
nothing
but
news
to
him
a
mere
statement
of
facts
but
as
he
read
further
a
meaning
flamed
into
the
news
bereft
as
he
was
of
guidance
his
mind
swinging
rudderless
in
chaos
he
was
waiting
unconsciously
for
the
man
or
the
impulse
that
could
seize
on
his
helpless
emotion
and
give
purpose
and
direction
to
his
life
thus
the
journalist
s
vigorous
appeal
to
the
nation
s
patriotism
was
driven
home
by
the
force
of
his
own
experience
and
became
an
appeal
to
himself
the
writer
had
illustrated
his
argument
in
the
obvious
manner
by
reference
to
the
condition
of
invaded
belgium
and
the
suffering
of
her
people
under
the
hand
and
heel
of
the
enemy
he
wrote
of
women
outraged
of
hostages
killed
of
cities
laid
waste
and
of
houses
fired
with
intention
he
was
spurred
by
indignation
by
pity
and
a
natural
patriotism
and
had
laid
on
his
all
but
a
vivid
and
forcible
pen
to
william
as
he
read
the
result
seemed
lame
and
pitiful
an
inadequate
babbling
of
the
living
horrors
that
had
burned
themselves
into
his
soul
but
for
all
its
because
of
article
gave
him
the
impulse
for
which
he
had
been
waiting
in
torment
it
may
have
been
his
very
sense
of
the
inadequacy
with
which
it
described
what
he
had
known
that
set
his
imagination
to
work
that
drove
home
its
purport
and
made
of
it
a
lead
to
his
blind
and
whirling
emotions
he
read
and
while
he
quivered
with
impatience
at
its
failure
if
the
man
had
seen
what
he
had
seen
if
the
man
had
lost
what
he
had
lost
he
could
not
have
argued
so
tamely
his
pen
would
have
been
dipped
in
fire
he
would
have
written
so
that
all
men
reading
him
would
have
rushed
to
arms
the
paper
dropped
from
his
hands
to
the
table
and
he
sat
staring
at
a
picture
of
his
own
a
crowd
bitter
and
determined
moved
by
the
tale
of
wrongdoing
to
a
righteous
and
terrible
wrath
he
saw
it
setting
forth
to
execute
justice
and
avenge
innocent
blood
and
himself
one
of
it
spurring
and
urging
it
on
so
he
first
visualized
himself
as
a
unscientific
combatant
of
the
homeric
pattern
but
nevertheless
a
soldier
the
vision
thrilled
and
inspired
him
and
out
of
the
deep
waters
of
his
impotent
misery
he
clutched
at
the
knowledge
that
he
could
act
resent
resist
that
ceasing
to
suffer
as
the
slave
suffers
he
could
give
back
blow
for
blow
there
was
enough
of
the
old
leaven
in
him
to
bring
him
up
suddenly
and
with
something
like
a
round
turn
as
he
realized
that
the
act
of
striking
blow
for
blow
against
the
german
would
involve
the
further
act
of
enlistment
and
the
wearing
of
the
king
s
uniform
his
first
mental
vision
of
his
warrior
crowd
had
been
vague
as
well
as
homeric
he
had
only
seen
faces
uplifted
by
courage
not
the
khaki
and
buttons
below
himself
rather
as
an
avenger
of
griselda
than
as
a
soldier
of
the
british
empire
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
that
he
shied
like
a
nervous
horse
at
the
bogey
of
the
hired
assassin
the
prophets
from
whom
he
had
learned
his
contempt
for
the
soldier
were
no
longer
prophets
to
him
and
his
conversion
was
the
more
thorough
from
his
ingrained
and
extremist
conviction
that
the
opposite
of
wrong
must
be
right
conversion
in
the
sense
in
which
the
word
is
employed
by
the
religious
describes
most
clearly
the
process
through
which
he
had
passed
conviction
of
ignorance
the
burden
of
christian
a
sense
of
blind
longing
and
humiliated
now
at
the
end
light
flashed
on
him
suddenly
salvation
figured
by
the
sword
it
was
so
to
speak
but
a
partial
salvation
he
had
lost
his
capacity
for
absolute
faith
for
the
rapture
that
comes
of
infallibility
but
he
was
of
all
men
the
last
who
could
live
without
guidance
and
his
new
creed
had
at
least
this
was
supported
by
his
own
experience
its
articles
had
he
formulated
them
would
have
been
negative
rather
than
have
ceased
to
believe
in
the
old
rather
than
i
believe
in
the
new
but
it
gave
him
that
working
hypothesis
without
which
life
to
him
was
impossible
when
he
took
his
seat
next
morning
in
the
train
bound
for
dieppe
his
mind
was
made
up
fiercely
and
his
future
course
of
action
and
as
a
result
something
that
was
by
comparison
peace
had
succeeded
to
the
chaos
and
dazed
rebellion
of
his
first
few
hours
of
loss
his
companion
noticed
the
change
in
his
manner
and
bearing
it
was
not
that
he
seemed
more
resigned
but
that
he
had
ceased
to
eyes
were
as
haggard
as
yesterday
but
not
so
vague
and
purposeless
so
far
during
their
brief
but
close
acquaintance
she
had
treated
him
perforce
as
she
would
have
treated
a
for
his
bodily
and
mental
needs
and
giving
him
kindly
orders
now
ignorant
and
obedient
as
he
still
was
in
the
matter
of
foreign
travel
he
was
once
more
a
reasonable
being
he
was
still
for
the
most
part
sunk
in
his
own
thoughts
but
not
helplessly
and
endlessly
so
he
was
capable
of
being
roused
and
at
intervals
he
roused
himself
once
when
they
halted
she
was
struck
by
the
intentness
with
which
he
gazed
at
a
trainload
of
soldiers
in
come
from
england
and
moving
up
from
havre
to
the
front
they
crossed
at
a
wayside
station
and
the
two
trains
stood
side
by
side
for
some
minutes
while
william
craned
out
of
the
window
to
stare
at
the
brown
young
faces
that
were
thrust
from
the
opposite
carriages
the
sight
moved
him
if
not
in
the
same
fashion
as
it
moved
his
companion
he
felt
no
tightening
of
the
throat
and
no
pride
in
the
men
themselves
what
kept
his
head
at
the
window
till
the
train
moved
off
was
chiefly
the
thought
that
soon
he
would
be
even
as
these
sunbrowned
men
of
war
the
personal
desire
to
know
what
manner
of
men
they
were
how
they
lived
and
moved
and
had
their
daily
military
being
hitherto
a
soldier
of
the
variety
had
been
to
him
nothing
more
definite
than
an
impression
of
uniform
khaki
and
occasionally
red
now
with
the
eyes
of
his
newborn
interest
he
became
aware
of
detail
that
had
formerly
escaped
him
and
compared
him
in
figure
in
face
and
garment
with
heinz
and
heinz
s
companions
these
lads
smoking
pipes
and
calling
jests
would
be
his
own
comrades
in
days
to
come
thus
he
studied
their
features
their
dress
their
manner
as
a
small
boy
scans
and
studies
the
bearing
of
his
future
schoolfellows
if
he
did
not
thrill
at
the
sight
of
young
men
about
to
die
he
sent
with
them
remembering
griselda
his
strong
desire
for
their
great
and
terrible
victory
those
were
the
days
just
before
mons
was
fought
when
france
and
others
with
her
was
hopeful
of
a
war
that
would
end
at
her
frontier
and
beyond
it
when
whatever
her
wiser
soldiers
may
have
known
her
people
in
general
had
no
premonition
of
the
coming
retreat
of
the
allied
armies
and
the
coming
peril
of
the
capital
there
were
still
some
ignorant
and
optimistic
days
to
live
before
france
as
a
whole
would
be
stunned
by
the
curt
official
admission
that
the
enemy
was
well
within
her
his
stretched
across
the
country
from
the
vosges
mountains
to
the
somme
as
for
railway
communication
on
the
western
lines
the
rush
of
returning
tourists
that
had
followed
on
the
outbreak
of
war
was
over
and
the
rush
from
paris
that
began
with
the
new
threat
of
kluck
s
advance
was
as
yet
a
thing
of
the
future
thus
william
and
his
companion
though
they
travelled
slowly
and
with
lengthy
halts
travelled
in
comparative
in
unpunctuality
and
a
measure
of
overcrowding
but
little
to
grumble
at
after
their
journey
by
to
paris
rouen
kept
them
waiting
an
hour
or
two
and
there
was
another
long
purposeless
halt
on
the
boat
in
dieppe
harbour
so
that
it
was
nigh
upon
sundown
when
they
slipped
into
the
channel
and
headed
for
folkestone
the
day
very
calm
with
the
stillness
of
perfect
summer
was
even
as
that
day
but
a
month
ago
when
william
and
his
little
bride
had
steamed
away
from
dover
sitting
to
touching
hands
when
they
thought
no
one
saw
them
and
remembering
the
fading
of
those
other
white
cliffs
william
s
heart
cried
out
against
god
it
was
well
past
midnight
when
they
slid
into
folkestone
harbour
where
again
there
were
long
delays
so
long
that
morning
was
red
over
france
when
the
train
drew
away
from
the
pier
it
was
during
the
journey
to
charing
cross
that
william
first
spoke
to
his
friend
of
his
purpose
of
becoming
a
soldier
they
were
not
by
themselves
in
the
carriage
but
the
other
occupants
nodded
off
to
sleep
soon
after
the
train
had
left
folkestone
and
for
all
practical
purposes
he
and
edith
haynes
were
alone
she
was
surprised
by
the
announcement
more
surprised
perhaps
than
she
should
have
on
account
of
his
previous
record
than
because
his
appearance
and
manner
were
so
utterly
unmilitary
the
british
soldier
of
days
was
a
type
a
man
of
a
class
apart
it
was
a
type
and
class
to
which
william
tully
was
far
from
approximating
and
she
found
it
impossible
to
picture
his
essentially
civilian
countenance
between
a
khaki
collar
and
cap
her
surprise
must
have
shown
in
her
manner
for
he
began
to
explain
in
jerks
it
seems
the
only
thing
to
do
he
said
you
can
t
sit
down
and
let
it
go
on
when
you
ve
seen
what
i
ve
seen
you
ve
got
to
do
what
you
can
and
they
want
re
asking
for
them
the
papers
say
they
want
all
the
men
they
can
get
it
s
got
to
be
or
another
and
there
doesn
t
seem
any
other
way
his
voice
tailed
off
and
he
turned
his
eyes
the
flying
fields
where
the
dew
was
still
wet
and
the
shadows
still
long
upon
the
grass
when
a
few
minutes
later
he
told
her
suddenly
it
was
just
as
pretty
as
it
happened
she
knew
that
he
was
mentally
transforming
the
peace
and
greenery
of
a
kentish
landscape
into
the
background
of
such
an
imitation
of
hell
as
he
had
lived
through
in
the
forest
of
arden
it
was
not
till
they
were
well
on
the
london
side
of
tonbridge
that
he
turned
again
to
his
companion
something
that
she
had
said
in
appreciation
of
his
kindly
meant
phrase
that
commended
his
seemingly
been
held
in
his
mind
i
don
t
want
you
to
think
it
s
courage
and
i
don
t
want
you
to
think
i
m
making
any
m
not
i
m
enlisting
because
i
want
to
there
isn
t
anything
else
for
me
to
do
everything
s
gone
haven
t
anything
to
go
back
to
no
duties
or
i
don
t
see
how
you
can
call
it
a
sacrifice
he
swallowed
and
halted
again
and
she
could
only
nod
in
silence
she
knew
enough
of
him
by
this
time
to
know
that
what
he
said
was
truth
having
learned
in
the
course
of
their
days
of
acquaintanceship
that
he
had
lost
even
more
than
his
newly
made
wife
his
hopes
of
a
home
and
children
in
very
deed
he
had
nothing
to
go
back
to
neither
home
nor
daily
occupation
in
losing
his
cocksure
infallible
creed
he
had
lost
the
interests
wherewith
his
days
had
been
filled
his
meetings
his
busy
committees
the
whole
paraphernalia
of
his
agitator
s
life
were
with
yesterday
s
seven
thousand
years
even
if
griselda
had
not
died
he
knowing
what
he
knew
would
have
had
to
begin
life
again
near
chislehurst
reminded
of
the
nearness
of
london
he
put
an
apologetic
question
you
ll
think
me
very
ignorant
he
said
but
you
see
i
ve
never
had
anything
to
do
with
soldiers
have
you
any
idea
how
you
set
about
joining
the
army
she
explained
that
he
had
only
to
offer
himself
and
turned
up
an
english
newspaper
bought
the
day
before
at
dieppe
to
point
out
a
paragraph
giving
the
situation
of
the
various
london
recruiting
stations
he
studied
it
with
interest
and
showed
her
that
the
nearest
to
charing
cross
was
a
station
on
the
horse
guards
parade
she
had
not
understood
that
his
intention
was
to
enlist
at
the
moment
of
arrival
in
london
and
suggested
a
delay
of
a
day
or
two
for
rest
if
not
for
reflection
the
life
before
him
was
a
hard
one
physically
and
he
had
been
passing
through
a
week
of
exhaustion
both
physical
and
mental
to
her
arguments
he
shook
his
head
stubbornly
impatient
he
was
so
urgent
to
translate
his
new
convictions
into
immediate
action
that
it
was
with
difficulty
she
prevailed
on
him
to
delay
at
charing
cross
for
breakfast
and
only
manoeuvred
him
into
the
hotel
by
assuring
rightly
or
wrongly
she
knew
it
was
as
yet
far
too
early
in
the
day
for
any
recruiting
official
to
be
at
his
post
on
that
assurance
he
yielded
and
they
took
their
last
meal
together
she
had
contracted
an
odd
species
of
affection
for
the
little
bereft
and
destitute
man
whom
chance
had
thrown
on
her
hands
in
his
hour
of
need
it
was
difficult
for
her
to
rid
herself
of
a
sense
of
responsibility
for
him
and
his
doings
and
as
they
disposed
of
their
eggs
and
bacon
she
found
herself
wondering
with
tears
in
her
throat
how
he
could
come
through
the
discipline
and
hardship
for
which
his
soft
life
had
done
so
little
to
prepare
him
it
was
pathetic
and
even
ridiculous
to
think
of
him
as
a
soldier
this
wisp
of
a
talker
to
think
of
him
marching
and
bearing
arms
in
defence
of
such
as
topped
him
by
a
good
two
inches
and
had
treated
him
almost
as
a
child
she
coaxed
him
to
eat
a
good
breakfast
dawdling
over
her
own
that
he
should
sit
and
rest
the
longer
and
when
he
suddenly
remembered
to
ask
her
how
much
he
owed
her
for
the
expenses
of
the
last
few
days
she
gave
him
with
the
hastily
invented
amount
her
address
in
somerset
and
made
him
promise
to
write
and
keep
her
informed
of
his
doings
he
on
his
part
shrinking
instinctively
from
those
who
had
shared
his
errors
in
the
old
life
clung
to
her
as
the
one
person
who
understood
the
new
world
into
which
he
had
so
lately
it
because
she
was
part
of
it
thus
neither
was
unmoved
when
they
shook
hands
as
friends
and
parted
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
she
entered
a
taxi
for
paddington
and
he
turned
his
face
to
whitehall
and
the
tent
on
the
horse
guards
parade
as
he
walked
down
whitehall
his
heart
thudded
loudly
on
his
ribs
he
remembered
with
a
sudden
tremor
of
rage
how
heinz
had
boasted
of
his
kaiser
at
westminster
and
a
german
entry
into
london
the
very
thought
made
london
dearer
and
finer
to
him
and
he
had
a
vision
of
himself
driving
heinz
before
and
that
other
the
young
man
with
black
eyebrows
who
had
worked
his
will
on
griselda
he
saw
himself
striking
and
stabbing
at
the
young
him
down
while
he
prayed
in
terror
for
a
mercy
that
was
not
granted
his
lips
were
a
hard
white
line
and
his
fingers
clenched
and
unclenched
london
by
god
it
should
be
not
london
but
berlin
he
had
never
dreamed
of
rejection
he
knew
vaguely
that
recruits
were
required
to
pass
some
sort
of
medical
examination
but
the
idea
that
his
proffered
services
might
be
refused
had
never
entered
his
head
edith
haynes
like
himself
had
seen
few
english
newspapers
for
weeks
thus
he
did
not
know
till
he
came
to
enlist
that
the
standard
of
measurement
for
recruits
had
been
raised
since
the
outbreak
of
war
and
that
he
standing
under
five
foot
five
was
not
up
to
the
army
s
requirements
in
the
matter
of
breadth
and
inches
the
knowledge
took
him
like
a
blow
between
the
eyes
and
he
stood
with
dropped
jaw
was
inhuman
it
was
monstrous
that
they
should
take
from
him
his
right
to
strike
back
for
a
moment
he
had
no
words
he
dressed
mechanically
stupid
with
the
the
man
grinned
damnably
over
griselda
dead
by
the
roadside
and
when
in
the
end
his
speech
came
back
and
he
tried
to
stammer
an
appeal
some
one
patted
him
on
the
shoulder
put
his
hat
into
his
hand
and
turned
him
loose
into
a
world
that
had
no
meaning
for
him
there
were
many
parallels
to
the
case
and
conversion
of
william
tully
in
the
first
few
weeks
of
the
war
there
is
and
always
will
be
the
temperament
that
can
shut
its
eyes
to
the
fact
and
tread
the
pathways
of
the
paradise
of
fools
even
if
it
treads
them
alone
but
on
the
whole
humanity
is
reasonable
and
given
a
fact
however
surprising
and
savagely
unpleasant
accepts
it
because
it
must
those
who
struggled
hardest
against
the
acceptance
of
the
of
were
naturally
enough
those
who
had
fiery
little
battles
of
their
own
to
fight
and
whose
own
warfare
was
suddenly
rendered
null
and
incompetent
by
a
sudden
diversion
of
energy
and
interest
in
the
face
of
the
national
danger
the
war
was
the
successful
rival
of
their
own
their
sectional
strife
overshadowing
its
importance
and
sucking
the
life
from
its
veins
hence
instinctively
they
sneered
at
it
and
strove
to
ignore
its
existence
hating
it
as
a
minor
and
incompetent
artist
may
hate
the
greater
professional
rival
who
sings
or
acts
him
off
the
stage
only
by
some
such
reasoning
can
one
account
for
the
fact
that
the
aggressive
and
essentially
militarist
type
of
political
enthusiast
so
often
runs
to
pacifism
where
the
quarrels
of
others
are
concerned
but
for
the
bitter
mischance
of
a
honeymoon
spent
in
the
forest
of
arden
and
the
consequences
thereby
brought
about
such
would
very
certainly
have
been
the
mental
attitude
of
william
tully
in
the
august
of
his
own
battles
would
have
absorbed
his
aggressive
instincts
and
never
having
seen
a
shot
fired
in
anger
he
would
have
continued
for
quite
a
long
time
to
think
of
other
battles
as
enlarged
street
riots
which
were
thoroughly
enjoyed
by
the
bloodthirsty
soldiery
who
provoked
them
he
would
have
the
possibility
of
a
war
until
the
war
actually
broke
out
and
then
insisting
that
it
was
avoidable
and
should
not
have
been
have
clung
angrily
to
his
customary
interests
and
done
his
small
energetic
best
to
keep
his
comrades
from
straying
into
that
wider
and
bloodier
field
where
they
and
their
services
would
be
lost
to
the
sectional
conflict
such
very
certainly
would
have
been
his
course
of
action
had
he
made
his
wedding
journey
to
torquay
fate
and
not
temperament
had
willed
it
that
he
should
be
driven
to
enlist
under
the
rival
banner
of
nationality
but
there
were
others
of
his
kidney
whom
fate
had
not
driven
so
brutally
and
who
unable
to
effect
as
william
had
done
a
rapid
transfer
of
allegiance
and
antagonisms
struggled
desperately
to
uphold
in
despite
of
war
their
partially
deserted
standard
of
such
was
faraday
dogged
and
fiercely
indefatigable
though
the
man
had
soul
and
brain
enough
to
feel
the
ground
rock
beneath
him
his
ignorance
of
european
politics
was
a
thought
less
profound
than
william
s
but
sufficiently
profound
to
have
bred
in
him
a
complete
disbelief
in
the
possibility
of
european
war
hence
his
surprise
at
the
international
earthquake
was
almost
as
great
as
that
of
his
former
disciple
when
the
unbelievable
happened
he
as
was
but
natural
was
men
are
angry
when
the
habit
of
years
is
interfered
with
and
in
the
first
flush
of
his
annoyance
ascribed
the
falsification
of
his
every
prediction
not
to
his
own
blundering
but
to
the
sins
of
those
who
did
not
think
as
he
did
those
who
prophesied
he
prophesied
what
they
desired
all
the
same
he
was
not
like
william
devoid
of
the
imaginative
faculty
but
the
war
was
as
yet
a
great
way
off
and
his
hatred
of
the
government
of
his
own
country
was
real
with
time
he
too
came
to
understand
that
a
people
may
have
other
foes
than
those
of
its
own
household
and
be
threatened
with
death
from
without
when
he
was
called
up
under
the
conscription
act
he
went
without
protest
made
an
excellent
soldier
and
died
fighting
in
a
night
raid
near
hulluch
but
in
the
beginning
the
habit
and
association
of
years
was
too
strong
for
him
and
his
bitter
dislike
of
his
neighbour
overpowered
his
fear
of
the
german
during
the
first
few
weeks
of
the
war
he
held
peace
meetings
at
considerable
personal
risk
which
as
became
a
good
fighter
he
took
even
with
enjoyment
distributed
printed
appeals
to
pacifist
and
sentiment
and
wrote
passionately
if
with
less
than
his
usual
clarity
in
he
could
not
in
honesty
bring
himself
to
defend
every
action
of
his
country
s
enemies
and
was
conscious
of
occasional
difficulty
and
a
sense
of
thin
ice
underneath
him
at
the
same
time
it
was
against
his
tradition
and
principles
to
admit
that
the
statesmanship
of
the
land
he
was
born
in
could
ever
have
right
on
its
side
tradition
and
principles
might
have
won
hands
down
making
him
ardently
and
happily
had
it
not
been
for
the
complication
introduced
by
the
attitude
of
other
nations
which
foreign
even
as
germany
was
foreign
had
chosen
to
range
themselves
with
england
hence
a
difficulty
in
indiscriminate
condemnation
and
a
momentary
confusion
of
thought
and
outlook
of
which
faraday
himself
was
quite
enough
to
be
conscious
it
irritated
him
and
he
was
sensible
of
failure
and
uncertainty
on
the
day
that
william
arrived
in
london
and
was
refused
for
the
british
army
faraday
held
a
small
meeting
in
a
hall
in
a
bloomsbury
side
street
the
object
of
the
meeting
was
to
consider
suitable
methods
of
influencing
for
the
better
the
existing
and
lamentable
condition
of
popular
opinion
the
gathering
was
not
open
to
the
general
public
only
the
initiated
being
present
some
thirty
to
forty
of
the
initiated
chiefly
secretaries
chairmen
and
other
branch
officials
of
the
advanced
socialist
group
of
which
faraday
was
leading
light
and
the
most
part
men
but
with
a
sprinkling
of
women
among
them
they
had
been
summoned
together
by
letter
and
word
of
mouth
the
meeting
was
private
and
consultative
described
as
for
sympathizers
only
and
held
at
the
headquarters
of
the
central
london
large
room
sparsely
furnished
with
chairs
and
a
platform
in
the
neighbourhood
of
tottenham
court
road
one
of
the
more
muscular
members
of
the
branch
kept
watch
and
ward
in
the
passage
outside
the
hall
scrutinizing
the
comrades
as
they
neared
the
door
lest
any
uninitiated
person
or
disturber
of
peace
should
attempt
to
gain
entry
with
the
faithful
he
was
thrilled
with
a
vague
and
grandiose
conviction
that
the
meeting
was
of
perilous
importance
passed
in
his
were
all
his
a
mysterious
nod
and
compared
himself
to
a
sentinel
on
duty
in
a
post
of
extreme
danger
he
was
a
young
man
domiciled
in
the
hampstead
garden
suburb
with
uncut
hair
a
flowing
tie
and
a
latent
if
hitherto
undeveloped
sense
of
humour
and
a
year
or
two
later
when
the
army
had
claimed
him
and
he
stood
in
the
ypres
salient
in
a
post
of
extreme
danger
he
grinned
unhappily
between
the
as
the
night
of
the
meeting
came
back
to
him
among
his
thirty
or
forty
familiars
he
passed
in
william
had
come
to
the
hall
mechanically
scarce
knowing
where
his
steps
were
guiding
him
no
wind
of
the
meeting
had
come
to
him
but
the
place
was
one
of
his
central
london
branch
of
which
he
was
chairman
assembled
there
on
business
once
a
week
further
it
was
used
as
the
address
of
the
branch
and
he
was
accustomed
to
call
there
almost
daily
for
his
official
letters
or
the
transaction
of
small
official
business
thus
it
happened
at
the
close
of
a
bewildered
day
that
he
turned
to
it
almost
by
instinct
perhaps
it
was
a
sense
of
homelessness
that
drove
him
to
its
open
it
was
not
until
well
towards
evening
that
he
had
summoned
up
courage
to
enter
his
own
dwelling
the
little
flat
he
had
not
yet
lived
in
made
ready
for
himself
and
griselda
if
there
had
been
anywhere
else
to
go
perhaps
he
never
would
have
entered
it
but
his
bachelor
lodging
he
knew
was
let
to
a
new
tenant
and
he
had
not
money
enough
in
his
pocket
to
pay
for
a
lodging
elsewhere
his
day
had
been
spent
on
foot
after
his
refusal
at
the
recruiting
station
he
had
walked
he
knew
not
there
through
street
after
street
that
he
might
not
stop
and
think
and
when
in
the
late
afternoon
he
found
himself
sitting
on
the
turf
of
primrose
hill
he
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
remember
the
route
by
which
he
had
reached
it
sheer
weariness
of
body
drove
him
to
shelter
and
half
an
hour
later
he
was
dragging
his
feet
up
the
stairs
that
led
to
the
flat
the
woman
who
was
to
do
for
himself
and
griselda
had
been
installed
on
the
premises
for
some
days
past
since
the
outbreak
of
war
she
had
been
in
hourly
expectation
of
the
arrival
of
her
master
and
mistress
and
in
some
perturbation
at
the
continued
lack
of
news
from
them
as
william
was
about
to
walk
past
the
door
she
had
opened
to
him
she
stayed
him
with
an
inquisitive
could
not
remember
the
form
it
took
but
knew
that
it
must
have
referred
to
griselda
s
absence
for
he
told
her
abruptly
that
his
wife
had
died
in
france
she
threw
up
her
hands
with
a
screaming
exclamation
as
he
hurried
past
her
to
shut
himself
into
the
bedroom
there
afraid
of
her
curious
sympathy
and
questions
he
shut
and
locked
himself
in
with
the
poignant
loneliness
of
the
furniture
that
he
and
griselda
had
chosen
and
lovingly
admired
with
the
poignant
company
of
griselda
s
photograph
smiling
from
the
centre
of
the
mantelpiece
and
set
in
an
ornate
silver
frame
that
was
one
of
her
wedding
presents
he
held
it
in
his
hands
till
the
tears
blinded
him
kissed
it
sobbing
and
laid
it
face
downwards
the
general
burning
with
inquisitive
sympathy
induced
him
after
one
or
two
unsuccessful
attempts
to
open
the
door
to
her
knocking
pressed
on
him
in
spite
of
denials
a
scratch
meal
of
tea
and
poached
eggs
and
hovered
round
while
he
ate
it
as
befitted
the
occasion
she
held
her
apron
to
her
eyes
while
she
extracted
as
much
as
she
could
in
the
way
of
information
later
as
she
washed
up
in
the
kitchen
she
heard
him
moving
from
one
tiny
room
to
with
a
restless
misery
and
a
restless
wonder
as
to
what
he
should
do
with
his
life
still
later
she
heard
him
go
out
again
though
he
had
hidden
away
the
photograph
thrusting
it
out
of
sight
into
a
drawer
the
furniture
was
always
there
and
always
waiting
for
griselda
the
moment
came
when
he
could
no
longer
suffer
its
company
and
went
out
into
the
street
to
avoid
it
other
purpose
in
walking
he
had
thus
it
happened
that
mechanically
and
without
intent
he
drifted
into
the
bloomsbury
where
faraday
held
his
meeting
the
important
doorkeeper
would
have
greeted
him
with
more
than
a
gladly
in
fact
have
detained
him
after
his
four
weeks
absence
to
exchange
comments
and
views
on
the
european
situation
but
william
in
entering
made
no
response
to
his
hallo
back
again
which
it
may
be
he
did
not
even
hear
he
walked
straight
past
the
sentinel
and
into
the
bare
familiar
everything
from
the
seats
to
their
occupants
was
just
as
it
had
been
and
where
every
face
was
known
to
him
time
for
a
moment
turned
back
in
its
traces
and
yesterday
unrolled
before
his
eyes
he
gazed
at
it
and
sat
down
himself
in
the
last
row
of
chairs
edwardes
the
central
london
secretary
was
hugging
his
ankle
as
he
always
hugged
it
and
the
formidable
treasurer
of
the
golder
s
green
branch
frowned
through
her
at
the
speaker
with
her
chin
uplifted
as
of
old
wore
the
same
capacious
crossed
knees
showed
the
same
robe
and
her
son
young
as
his
habit
was
sprawled
sideways
on
one
chair
and
curled
his
long
limbs
round
another
it
was
all
as
it
had
been
and
faraday
on
the
platform
was
speaking
with
the
accents
of
yesterday
the
important
doorkeeper
was
not
the
only
comrade
who
had
noticed
william
s
return
one
or
two
heads
were
turned
as
he
came
in
but
for
the
most
part
the
audience
was
intent
on
the
words
of
the
speaker
the
heads
that
turned
made
some
sign
of
pleased
recognition
to
which
william
responded
automatically
unknowing
that
he
did
so
from
his
seat
near
the
door
his
eyes
wandered
slowly
over
the
platform
the
hall
and
its
and
with
a
dull
and
detached
curiosity
what
he
saw
there
and
heard
was
unreal
like
a
scene
in
an
unconvincing
play
he
had
a
sense
of
looking
at
these
people
from
a
great
way
off
of
hearing
their
voices
from
a
distance
something
separated
and
held
him
removed
from
them
he
had
great
difficulty
in
giving
his
attention
to
what
the
speaker
was
saying
yet
in
the
old
days
faraday
had
always
stirred
him
and
he
was
speaking
well
from
thirty
to
forty
convinced
adherents
assembled
at
a
private
conference
are
not
the
material
upon
which
a
public
orator
usually
throws
away
his
best
endeavours
but
faraday
that
night
was
speaking
not
so
much
to
his
audience
as
to
himself
unadmitted
even
to
his
secret
soul
he
had
great
and
fierce
need
of
conviction
it
was
with
his
own
doubts
that
he
wrestled
at
his
own
head
that
he
flung
both
his
jeers
and
his
arguments
he
was
of
a
finer
because
more
intelligent
mould
than
the
edwardeses
and
who
heard
him
and
who
were
still
thinking
of
the
european
tragedy
as
a
red
herring
drawn
by
the
cunning
politician
across
the
path
of
progress
not
for
him
was
their
happy
imperviousness
to
the
new
idea
and
looking
down
from
his
platform
on
their
assembled
faces
it
may
have
struck
him
not
pleasantly
that
these
people
were
in
part
of
his
making
they
were
at
any
rate
the
product
of
a
system
of
which
he
in
common
with
politicians
of
every
creed
had
not
scrupled
to
make
full
use
be
that
as
it
may
he
spoke
feelingly
and
well
that
night
far
better
and
more
feelingly
than
was
needed
by
the
numbers
the
attitude
and
calibre
of
his
audience
which
was
comfortably
and
stubbornly
determined
to
agree
with
him
before
he
opened
his
mouth
he
had
not
come
to
the
meeting
with
intent
to
be
so
lengthy
and
urgent
he
had
planned
to
be
nothing
more
than
brief
and
to
give
and
invite
suggestions
for
a
vigorous
prosecution
of
the
campaign
but
when
he
rose
to
open
the
discussion
he
was
carried
away
by
his
own
doubts
and
emotions
and
the
few
remarks
he
had
thought
to
make
flared
out
into
a
veritable
speech
he
fought
with
and
poured
scorn
on
himself
in
the
name
of
others
rallying
his
feebleness
with
argument
and
sneering
at
his
own
hesitations
thus
he
spoke
eloquently
and
deserved
the
applause
which
greeted
him
when
he
sat
down
edwardes
followed
him
in
response
to
the
invitation
for
suggestions
a
little
labour
man
whose
ideal
was
a
world
of
committees
there
had
been
something
alive
about
faraday
s
outpouring
it
was
the
speech
of
a
man
who
however
resentfully
understood
that
the
world
had
moved
but
as
edwardes
quacked
earnestly
about
branch
propaganda
as
an
antidote
to
militarism
and
a
means
of
diffusing
the
international
idea
the
sense
of
unreality
descended
again
upon
william
branch
leaflets
and
guns
made
a
pulp
of
flesh
and
blood
and
men
were
being
shot
against
walls
resolutions
in
against
wrongs
like
griselda
s
and
his
own
for
the
first
time
for
many
days
he
felt
a
desire
to
laugh
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
his
sense
of
the
distant
unreality
of
the
proceedings
perhaps
he
would
have
been
moved
to
actual
expression
of
perverted
and
unmirthful
mirth
it
was
young
who
made
the
proceedings
real
to
him
and
but
for
his
intervention
at
the
end
of
the
discussion
it
is
probable
that
william
himself
would
have
taken
no
part
in
it
he
would
have
listened
for
a
little
perhaps
to
the
end
and
then
crept
out
to
his
loneliness
but
roused
him
and
swept
him
out
of
himself
edwardes
quacked
earnestly
for
ten
minutes
or
so
the
aggrieved
outpourings
of
a
soul
to
which
the
really
serious
fact
of
the
war
was
that
it
had
caused
a
certain
amount
of
backsliding
and
even
desertion
amongst
the
weaker
brethren
of
his
branch
and
when
he
sat
down
after
a
moment
of
silence
rose
to
his
feet
in
the
dark
ages
that
had
ended
a
week
ago
william
thought
highly
of
edgar
esteeming
him
a
youth
of
great
promise
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
broad
shoulders
lolled
against
the
wall
and
his
hair
as
usual
drooped
over
an
eyebrow
he
drawled
out
fine
scorn
upon
the
leaders
of
the
labour
party
for
their
treachery
to
the
cause
of
the
people
and
their
lack
of
the
sense
of
brotherhood
there
was
no
particular
purport
in
his
vaguely
scathing
remarks
which
the
meeting
being
nominally
for
business
purposes
might
well
have
been
ruled
out
of
order
but
he
was
enjoying
the
sound
of
his
own
full
voice
and
his
mother
gazed
up
at
him
admiringly
it
was
more
himself
than
his
vague
remarks
that
made
william
flare
and
see
six
feet
of
conceited
boyhood
propped
sprawlingly
against
the
wall
as
he
listened
he
was
gripped
with
a
sudden
hatred
of
a
hatred
that
had
its
roots
in
envy
of
his
physical
perfections
it
was
for
lack
of
that
broad
deep
chest
and
those
long
strong
limbs
that
the
recruiting
officer
would
have
none
of
him
and
a
muscular
boy
a
potential
soldier
lolled
hands
in
pockets
and
cracked
ignorant
jests
at
men
who
knew
better
than
he
did
at
the
agony
of
such
as
himself
as
the
young
man
drawled
onward
william
breathed
fast
and
thickly
and
clutched
at
the
chair
in
front
of
him
till
having
sufficiently
scarified
the
official
representatives
of
labour
went
on
to
some
smartly
turned
gibes
at
the
recruiting
campaign
and
the
gulls
who
were
caught
by
its
appeals
one
of
his
sarcasms
brought
him
the
ready
laugh
he
had
counted
something
on
which
he
had
not
counted
at
the
tail
of
the
laugh
came
imperative
and
raucous
the
order
sit
down
you
young
fool
every
head
in
the
room
went
round
with
indignation
to
most
of
the
gathering
faraday
included
now
noticed
for
the
first
time
he
was
on
his
feet
stiffened
and
pallid
with
passion
but
after
the
cry
that
had
cut
short
he
stood
silent
with
his
lips
apart
and
his
hands
clutching
at
a
his
fingers
knotted
and
worked
as
they
clutched
and
his
mouth
was
twisted
and
quivering
he
stood
like
an
animal
backed
into
a
corner
defying
the
astounded
eyes
and
the
open
incredulous
mouths
of
those
who
had
once
been
his
comrades
most
incredulous
of
all
was
the
mouth
of
who
gaped
in
amazement
at
the
unprovoked
attack
on
her
son
may
i
began
edgar
less
slowly
and
languidly
than
william
hearing
the
silence
broken
also
found
words
to
his
tongue
you
may
ask
he
interrupted
oh
yes
you
may
ask
anything
you
like
but
for
god
s
sake
don
t
lay
down
the
law
and
make
ignorant
god
s
sake
don
t
do
that
you
mustn
t
lay
down
the
law
until
you
know
something
until
you
ve
really
tried
to
find
out
then
perhaps
you
ll
have
a
right
to
speak
now
when
i
hear
you
from
sheer
sense
of
the
inadequacy
of
words
his
voice
tailed
huskily
away
then
with
an
odd
little
snarl
at
his
auditors
he
burst
out
savagely
afresh
you
child
you
great
impudent
jackanapes
you
stand
there
and
dare
to
make
jokes
about
the
hell
that
other
men
have
burned
in
the
flames
and
the
blood
and
the
guns
and
people
dying
in
the
road
you
talk
blank
foolery
and
laugh
about
laugh
and
turn
up
your
nose
you
think
you
re
it
sickens
me
sickens
me
to
hear
you
he
finished
on
a
note
that
was
almost
a
scream
and
they
looked
at
him
aghast
and
dumfoundered
it
was
his
face
that
held
them
even
more
than
his
disconcerting
but
edgar
who
pricked
in
his
vanity
would
have
accepted
the
challenge
and
started
again
had
not
faraday
silenced
him
with
a
turn
of
the
head
and
a
gesture
still
more
pricked
in
his
vanity
he
slid
to
a
chair
muttering
sulkily
and
red
to
the
neck
began
faraday
with
reproof
in
his
tully
defied
even
his
mentor
not
savagely
and
with
contempt
as
he
had
defied
and
decried
but
as
one
who
had
a
right
to
be
heard
he
mustn
t
talk
like
that
till
he
knows
something
it
s
child
s
babble
i
know
what
i
m
ve
come
from
i
ve
a
right
to
tell
him
what
i
know
not
one
of
you
here
has
seen
what
i
re
just
guessing
when
a
shell
bursts
i
ve
seen
a
man
with
his
legs
like
red
jelly
and
a
horse
he
choked
at
the
memory
that
s
being
a
him
fight
and
he
ll
find
it
out
now
he
thinks
it
s
what
he
said
just
sort
of
game
that
they
like
everything
he
said
was
mean
little
dare
you
listen
to
it
and
laugh
at
his
silly
little
jokes
what
s
the
good
of
saying
that
it
shouldn
t
happen
of
course
it
shouldn
t
all
know
course
it
shouldn
t
happen
but
it
does
and
you
can
t
stop
it
with
sneers
about
soldiers
and
kitchener
it
s
hell
and
the
mouth
of
ve
seen
it
he
says
he
wouldn
t
lift
a
finger
to
keep
them
out
do
you
know
why
he
says
that
it
s
because
he
can
t
imagine
what
it
means
i
would
i
d
die
to
keep
them
out
because
i
ve
seen
i
ve
seen
a
man
a
soldier
just
an
ordinary
against
a
wall
and
shot
while
his
wife
howled
like
a
dog
two
their
wives
standing
by
they
might
do
that
to
him
if
they
he
ever
thought
of
that
his
mother
howled
like
a
dog
he
shot
out
a
quivering
finger
at
the
and
his
he
let
them
do
as
they
liked
with
his
women
they
would
if
they
came
can
take
my
word
for
it
they
would
would
he
ask
them
in
politely
and
shake
hands
and
give
them
drinks
and
let
them
if
they
came
people
would
run
from
them
leaving
everything
they
would
he
like
to
be
driven
and
beaten
and
made
to
work
like
a
slave
i
ve
had
ve
been
driven
and
beaten
and
made
to
work
and
i
ve
run
from
them
and
starved
and
hidden
because
i
was
afraid
and
my
wife
killed
there
was
a
gasp
a
rustle
of
movement
and
a
sudden
straightening
of
backs
every
one
in
the
room
knew
griselda
tully
many
quite
intimately
and
not
a
few
had
been
at
her
wedding
amazement
and
wrath
against
the
disturber
of
the
peace
gave
way
to
a
real
consternation
and
in
the
silence
that
followed
the
momentary
rustle
william
heard
faraday
s
good
god
they
stared
at
him
in
dumb
consternation
dimly
conscious
perhaps
that
they
were
in
the
presence
of
an
eternal
fact
and
that
the
little
man
who
stabbed
at
them
with
a
trembling
forefinger
was
the
embodiment
of
that
sense
of
injustice
and
agony
which
makes
men
cry
to
heaven
for
vengeance
and
heaven
failing
them
take
the
sword
and
smite
for
themselves
dolly
murgatroyd
griselda
s
bridesmaid
who
had
twice
accompanied
griselda
to
holloway
saw
and
shrank
from
the
reality
of
that
tortured
revolt
which
for
years
she
had
striven
to
simulate
under
the
lash
of
her
leaders
bombast
in
face
of
the
fact
that
was
william
their
theories
wilted
and
failed
them
and
the
new
black
suit
of
their
comrade
tully
was
to
them
as
the
writing
on
the
wall
at
the
feast
of
came
like
that
other
writing
on
the
wall
at
the
moment
when
the
evil
from
which
they
had
hidden
their
faces
was
an
evil
actually
accomplished
in
each
man
s
heart
was
a
faint
reflection
of
the
amaze
that
had
fallen
on
william
and
griselda
when
their
world
first
crumbled
about
them
the
sudden
movement
the
chairman
s
exclamation
and
the
abashed
silence
that
followed
it
checked
william
and
brought
him
to
a
standstill
speech
failed
him
and
he
stood
with
his
mouth
half
open
while
the
meeting
stared
at
him
motionless
there
was
a
blank
period
of
tension
of
awkward
stillness
hi
the
presence
of
emotion
and
then
faraday
coughed
uncertainly
and
moved
probably
he
intended
to
say
something
perhaps
to
adjourn
the
meeting
but
his
movement
and
the
breaking
of
silence
with
his
cough
gave
william
back
his
voice
and
he
spoke
before
faraday
began
and
they
won
t
take
me
in
the
army
although
my
wife
has
been
killed
they
won
t
take
me
in
the
army
i
m
not
tall
enough
i
m
only
five
foot
five
and
they
won
t
take
me
i
ve
seen
my
wife
died
in
the
they
refused
me
when
i
tried
to
enlist
if
i
were
only
two
inches
in
heaven
if
i
were
two
inches
taller
the
high
tight
voice
broke
suddenly
and
he
wept
with
his
face
in
his
hands
for
the
space
of
a
painful
moment
there
was
no
sound
in
the
room
but
his
man
knowing
what
to
do
or
where
to
turn
his
eyes
until
faraday
came
down
from
the
platform
the
tread
of
his
feet
on
the
gangway
broke
the
spell
of
embarrassed
chairs
were
moved
softly
and
the
occupants
looked
away
from
william
as
faraday
took
him
very
gently
by
the
arm
and
led
him
out
into
the
street
there
was
to
be
a
gulf
henceforth
between
william
and
faraday
and
the
twain
who
had
once
lived
so
near
together
were
to
see
but
little
of
each
other
yet
it
was
faraday
who
gave
him
the
first
word
of
comfort
as
he
walked
by
the
side
of
his
former
disciple
on
the
road
to
william
s
flat
if
he
said
suddenly
and
were
nearing
their
destination
and
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
opened
his
lips
since
he
led
william
out
of
the
if
it
s
this
recruiting
business
this
refusal
that
s
adding
to
your
trouble
i
don
t
think
you
need
be
too
much
discouraged
see
it
isn
t
necessarily
final
i
know
for
a
fact
they
re
refusing
men
now
because
they
can
t
equip
them
as
fast
as
they
come
in
they
haven
t
the
uniforms
the
accommodation
or
the
arms
and
that
s
why
they
sent
up
the
standard
for
recruits
with
a
rush
but
if
the
thing
s
as
big
as
they
common
talk
is
that
kitchener
has
prophesied
three
years
of
it
and
it
s
very
likely
ll
be
wanting
every
man
who
ll
come
in
before
they
ve
done
with
it
not
only
the
big
one
it
will
merely
be
a
question
of
a
few
the
outside
only
a
few
months
so
i
shouldn
t
take
this
refusal
to
heart
his
message
of
comfort
cost
faraday
something
to
deliver
it
was
the
sheer
wretchedness
of
the
broken
little
man
beside
him
that
moved
him
to
deny
his
principles
by
implication
if
not
in
so
many
words
the
only
audible
reply
that
he
received
was
a
sniff
but
even
in
the
darkness
he
knew
that
his
inconsistency
had
not
been
wasted
and
that
william
had
gained
from
it
some
measure
of
help
and
consolation
he
said
no
more
and
they
parted
with
constraint
on
the
pavement
outside
the
tread
through
the
future
ahead
of
them
their
separate
and
several
ways
faraday
did
not
go
back
to
his
meeting
he
left
it
to
break
up
or
pursue
as
it
would
while
he
walked
the
streets
restlessly
alone
between
the
uttering
and
fulfilment
of
faraday
s
prophecy
william
s
way
for
the
next
few
weeks
was
the
way
of
drift
and
uncertainty
it
was
also
the
way
of
great
loneliness
an
experience
entirely
new
to
him
loneliness
not
only
by
reason
of
the
loss
of
his
wife
but
because
of
the
gap
that
the
war
had
made
between
himself
and
his
former
associates
with
the
ending
of
his
platform
and
committee
career
he
was
cut
off
automatically
and
completely
from
the
fellowship
of
those
who
had
been
his
in
the
various
causes
and
enthusiasms
he
had
once
espoused
and
advocated
it
was
not
that
all
of
his
former
would
have
disagreed
with
his
altered
point
of
view
his
was
not
the
only
perversion
to
militarism
the
stalwarts
had
to
deplore
it
was
merely
that
he
ceased
to
meet
them
all
the
same
the
new
isolation
in
which
he
lived
was
largely
due
to
his
own
initiative
or
lack
of
it
since
many
even
among
the
stalwarts
would
have
given
him
kindly
welcome
and
done
their
best
to
be
of
help
to
him
personally
but
after
the
meeting
in
bloomsbury
he
felt
small
desire
to
seek
them
out
on
the
contrary
he
shrank
into
himself
and
avoided
as
far
as
possible
any
contact
with
those
whose
very
presence
would
remind
him
of
the
busy
life
he
had
passed
in
their
company
of
the
vanished
theoretical
world
where
he
had
met
griselda
and
loved
her
it
was
a
real
misfortune
that
his
small
private
income
though
to
a
certain
extent
affected
by
the
war
was
yet
sufficient
to
keep
a
roof
over
his
head
and
supply
him
with
decent
necessaries
of
food
and
clothing
thus
he
was
not
driven
to
the
daily
work
of
hand
or
brain
that
might
have
acted
as
a
tonic
to
the
lethargic
hopelessness
of
his
mood
nature
had
not
made
him
versatile
and
he
had
lived
in
a
groove
for
years
and
his
occupation
as
a
public
speaker
gone
he
was
left
without
interest
as
well
as
without
employment
more
than
once
goaded
into
spasmodic
activity
by
some
newspaper
paragraph
he
offered
himself
vaguely
for
to
be
discouraged
afresh
by
the
offer
of
an
entirely
unsuitable
job
or
by
delays
and
evasions
which
might
have
discouraged
men
more
competent
and
energetic
than
himself
in
one
respect
fortune
was
kind
to
him
he
was
able
within
a
week
or
two
of
his
return
to
london
to
get
rid
of
the
lease
of
the
haunted
little
flat
in
bloomsbury
the
place
was
dreadful
to
him
with
its
empty
demand
for
griselda
and
he
left
it
thankfully
for
a
lodging
in
camden
town
there
for
some
weeks
he
lived
drearily
in
two
small
rooms
with
no
occupation
to
fill
up
the
void
in
his
life
passing
hermit
days
in
the
company
of
newspapers
and
poring
over
cheap
war
literature
he
bought
many
newspapers
and
much
war
literature
and
aroused
the
sympathy
of
his
elderly
landlady
by
his
helplessness
and
continual
loneliness
what
kept
him
alive
mentally
was
his
thirsty
interest
in
the
war
anything
and
everything
that
dealt
with
it
was
grist
to
his
mill
and
he
acquired
necessarily
in
the
course
of
his
eager
reading
some
smattering
of
european
history
and
the
outlines
of
european
geography
the
pamphlet
and
journal
soon
ceased
to
satisfy
and
he
felt
the
need
of
supplementing
their
superficial
comments
and
sketchy
allusions
by
reading
that
was
not
a
newspaper
denunciation
of
the
silesian
policy
of
frederick
the
great
led
him
to
macaulay
and
others
on
the
kaiser
s
ancestor
and
references
to
the
war
resulted
in
the
borrowing
from
the
nearest
free
library
of
a
volume
of
modern
french
history
one
volume
led
on
to
others
and
the
local
librarian
came
to
know
him
as
a
regular
client
his
reading
was
haphazard
but
perhaps
for
that
reason
all
the
more
informative
and
illuminating
so
far
he
had
acquired
such
small
learning
as
he
possessed
on
a
definite
and
narrow
plan
assimilating
only
such
facts
as
squared
with
his
theories
and
rejecting
all
the
others
where
his
new
studies
were
concerned
the
very
blankness
of
his
ignorance
was
a
guarantee
of
freedom
from
prejudice
he
stumbled
amongst
facts
and
opinions
making
little
of
them
and
yet
making
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
there
was
no
glib
mentor
to
guide
him
and
he
was
thrown
on
his
own
resources
with
his
theories
demolished
and
his
mind
blank
as
a
child
s
he
became
aware
of
phases
of
human
idea
and
striving
of
which
he
had
known
nothing
in
the
past
and
the
resulting
comprehension
of
the
existence
of
spheres
outside
his
own
increased
his
sense
of
the
impossibility
of
his
previous
classification
of
mankind
into
the
and
the
evil
his
own
experience
had
shown
him
that
there
might
be
at
least
a
third
ignorant
the
mistaken
to
which
he
william
tully
his
reading
by
its
very
vagueness
confirmed
that
personal
experience
as
he
floundered
through
histories
bewildered
and
at
random
he
realized
dizzily
but
none
the
less
surely
something
of
the
vast
and
terrifying
complexity
of
these
human
problems
upon
which
he
had
once
pronounced
himself
with
the
certainty
of
absolute
ignorance
the
free
library
though
he
knew
it
not
was
a
salve
to
his
wounded
heart
all
unconsciously
he
had
done
the
best
for
himself
in
applying
his
mind
to
matters
of
which
his
little
wife
had
known
nothing
bismarckian
policy
and
the
napoleonic
wars
were
topics
he
had
not
discussed
and
interests
he
had
not
shared
with
her
hence
they
tended
to
come
between
him
and
her
memory
and
distract
him
from
lonely
brooding
without
his
new
studies
he
might
have
drifted
into
sheer
melancholia
and
helplessness
as
it
was
he
burned
midnight
gas
over
his
books
and
kept
his
brain
alive
in
a
measure
his
interest
in
his
new
studies
was
personal
the
craving
to
strike
back
was
always
with
him
and
his
reading
fed
and
fanned
it
beginning
without
system
he
was
naturally
enough
attracted
by
the
drama
and
movement
of
the
french
revolutionary
and
napoleonic
epoch
read
avidly
all
that
the
librarian
could
give
him
on
the
subject
and
moulded
his
ideas
of
a
soldier
s
life
and
military
science
on
the
doings
of
men
of
those
days
the
seed
of
hope
that
faraday
had
implanted
did
not
die
and
he
thought
of
himself
as
a
soldier
to
be
while
queer
little
ambitions
flamed
up
in
his
barren
heart
he
read
of
ney
and
murat
who
had
carried
marshals
batons
in
their
the
fervour
of
his
obsession
growing
he
dreamed
of
himself
as
an
avenging
leader
and
with
a
idea
of
fitting
himself
for
the
office
applied
hours
to
the
study
of
the
art
of
war
through
the
medium
of
an
obsolete
volume
on
military
lore
picked
up
from
a
bookstall
in
the
charing
cross
road
by
its
had
been
published
in
the
early
attempted
to
work
out
the
strategy
of
kluck
and
joffre
and
spent
long
evenings
poring
over
diagrams
explanatory
of
the
tactics
of
napoleon
at
montereau
or
the
archduke
charles
at
essling
for
a
time
his
only
real
human
intercourse
and
that
by
letter
was
with
edith
haynes
he
had
written
to
her
telling
of
his
rejection
for
the
army
and
she
wrote
to
him
more
than
occasionally
she
was
fixed
busily
in
her
somersetshire
home
looking
after
the
property
of
a
brother
fighting
in
flanders
acting
as
bailiff
and
herself
taking
a
hand
in
for
the
first
few
weeks
after
griselda
s
death
she
remained
william
s
only
friend
in
the
new
world
of
war
and
it
was
not
until
he
had
been
settled
for
nearly
two
months
in
his
camden
town
lodging
that
he
discovered
that
some
at
least
of
his
former
associates
had
seen
fit
like
himself
to
reconsider
their
views
and
take
up
arms
for
their
country
he
ran
against
one
of
in
the
old
days
a
fiery
of
his
the
garb
of
the
london
scottish
and
he
did
not
know
how
lonely
he
had
been
until
he
spent
an
evening
in
the
convert
s
company
talking
his
heart
out
talking
of
the
war
and
himself
with
the
first
announcement
of
the
reduction
in
the
standard
of
height
for
recruits
he
tried
to
enlist
again
and
was
again
time
by
the
doctor
who
seemingly
had
doubts
about
his
heart
on
the
way
home
a
fool
woman
arrogating
to
herself
the
right
to
make
men
die
for
her
offered
him
a
white
feather
as
he
stood
waiting
for
his
he
turned
and
swore
at
her
using
filthy
words
that
were
strange
to
his
lips
till
her
vapid
little
face
grew
scarlet
that
day
for
the
first
time
his
books
were
no
comfort
to
his
soul
and
he
thrust
them
away
and
sat
perhaps
how
personal
and
revengeful
had
been
his
interest
in
the
lore
of
the
past
understanding
how
strong
had
been
the
dreams
and
ambitions
he
had
cherished
in
his
empty
heart
watson
dropping
in
for
a
final
chat
before
starting
on
foreign
service
found
him
sullen
and
inert
before
his
fire
and
casting
about
for
a
method
of
comfort
suggested
application
to
another
recruiting
station
he
knew
he
said
of
more
than
one
man
who
refused
at
a
first
medical
examination
had
been
passed
without
trouble
at
a
second
hope
was
beaten
out
of
william
and
he
shook
his
head
all
the
same
next
morning
he
tubed
to
the
other
end
of
london
there
to
make
his
third
attempt
he
asked
his
way
to
the
townhall
and
in
a
species
of
dull
resignation
stood
waiting
his
turn
for
the
ordeal
of
medical
inspection
when
it
came
he
went
listlessly
through
the
now
familiar
process
stripped
was
weighed
and
measured
was
pummelled
showed
his
teeth
answered
questions
it
was
the
stethoscope
that
had
done
the
business
yesterday
and
would
do
it
again
not
that
there
was
anything
the
matter
with
him
or
his
was
just
the
blind
cruel
stupidity
that
was
always
and
in
everything
against
him
while
the
doctor
bent
to
listen
he
was
wondering
what
he
should
do
with
what
he
should
do
with
the
next
day
what
he
should
do
with
his
life
he
had
made
so
sure
of
a
third
rejection
that
he
could
hardly
believe
his
ears
when
he
heard
he
was
up
to
the
physical
standard
required
of
a
soldier
of
the
king
you
ve
made
a
mistake
was
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
and
though
he
checked
the
words
before
they
were
uttered
he
stood
dazed
and
staring
much
as
he
had
done
on
the
day
he
was
first
refused
he
could
not
remember
clearly
what
happened
to
him
next
or
what
he
did
he
went
where
he
was
told
he
sat
and
waited
he
repeated
words
which
he
knew
must
have
been
the
oath
his
fellows
talked
to
him
and
he
answered
back
but
all
he
was
conscious
of
was
the
stunning
fact
of
his
acceptance
it
seemed
to
him
griselda
must
know
and
he
had
thoughts
of
her
watching
him
of
her
white
soul
blessing
him
to
victory
a
pencilled
scrawl
despatched
from
a
mushroom
camp
in
the
home
counties
told
edith
haynes
that
william
was
at
last
a
soldier
it
was
brief
written
shakily
by
a
man
tired
in
body
but
uplifted
in
spirit
informed
her
that
he
had
just
been
absorbed
into
a
london
battalion
that
he
had
not
yet
got
his
uniform
was
sleeping
in
a
barn
and
drilling
hard
and
concluded
with
the
words
thank
god
she
answered
the
scrawl
by
return
of
post
and
a
few
weeks
later
hearing
nothing
wrote
again
but
in
spite
of
her
request
for
further
news
for
month
after
month
she
waited
in
vain
for
a
successor
to
the
shaky
scribble
when
it
came
the
war
had
been
in
progress
a
couple
of
years
and
the
address
was
a
procession
of
the
three
last
were
the
that
denoted
service
it
was
a
restrained
and
correct
little
letter
on
the
face
of
it
uninteresting
and
not
much
longer
than
the
last
but
differing
from
it
in
that
it
was
written
in
ink
and
in
the
tidy
clerical
hand
which
william
had
acquired
in
the
days
of
his
boyhood
for
the
use
of
the
insurance
office
it
expressed
regret
for
his
lengthy
silence
but
did
not
attempt
to
explain
it
and
went
on
to
relate
that
before
coming
to
france
he
had
been
an
clerk
that
he
was
at
present
at
an
advanced
must
not
of
course
give
its
he
was
employed
in
office
work
principally
the
typewriting
of
letters
it
concluded
with
an
assurance
that
he
had
not
forgotten
her
kindness
and
a
hope
she
would
write
to
him
again
and
she
read
and
the
polite
little
missive
what
lay
between
its
lines
it
had
been
written
in
an
interval
of
that
typing
of
local
official
communications
which
was
private
tully
s
daily
contribution
to
the
waging
of
the
european
war
and
it
had
not
been
written
earlier
because
private
tully
was
too
sullen
of
heart
to
write
for
a
few
weeks
only
he
had
known
what
it
was
to
be
a
soldier
of
england
in
the
making
he
had
drilled
he
had
marched
he
had
learned
to
hold
a
rifle
and
his
body
had
ached
with
the
discipline
he
had
lain
down
at
night
so
weary
that
he
could
not
sleep
and
he
had
risen
giddily
in
the
morning
in
fear
of
the
day
that
was
coming
other
men
filled
out
and
hardened
with
their
training
grew
healthy
muscular
and
he
set
his
teeth
and
argued
with
himself
that
this
stage
of
sick
exhaustion
was
only
a
stage
and
in
time
he
would
be
even
as
they
what
he
lacked
in
strength
he
made
up
in
fiery
willingness
overtaxing
his
energy
by
dogged
efforts
to
keep
level
with
broader
shouldered
tighter
muscled
men
and
steadfastly
refusing
to
admit
that
his
bodily
misery
was
more
than
a
passing
discomfort
more
than
once
a
comrade
suggested
a
visit
to
the
william
would
flush
as
at
an
insult
and
turn
on
the
meddler
almost
savagely
he
held
on
longer
than
he
could
have
done
unaided
by
virtue
of
much
kindly
help
once
in
a
sudden
need
for
sympathy
he
had
told
to
one
of
his
fellows
the
story
of
griselda
and
his
own
conversion
to
militarism
and
unknown
to
himself
the
story
went
the
round
of
his
mess
from
the
beginning
the
men
had
treated
him
with
the
instinctive
kindness
that
the
stronger
feels
for
the
weakling
but
from
that
time
forth
their
kindness
was
more
than
instinctive
they
ranged
themselves
tacitly
on
the
weakling
s
side
in
his
struggle
with
his
own
deficiencies
little
odd
jobs
of
cleaning
and
furbishing
were
done
for
secretly
he
knew
not
by
no
man
was
ever
too
weary
to
take
on
work
that
would
spare
him
they
were
in
a
conspiracy
to
save
him
from
warn
him
or
shield
him
from
consequences
and
as
far
as
camp
life
permitted
they
coddled
him
with
something
of
the
sweet
roughness
wherewith
nelson
was
coddled
by
his
captains
all
the
same
and
in
spite
of
coddling
the
breakdown
came
as
it
was
bound
to
do
in
the
end
the
doctor
who
refused
had
been
wiser
than
the
man
who
passed
him
there
was
nothing
urgently
or
seriously
wrong
with
his
health
but
he
was
not
made
soundly
enough
to
stand
the
violent
and
sudden
change
from
a
sedentary
life
to
a
life
of
unceasing
exertion
he
had
never
taken
much
exercise
had
always
trained
or
bussed
it
rather
than
travel
afoot
and
of
late
his
days
had
been
spent
entirely
between
the
four
walls
of
his
camden
town
it
was
on
the
homeward
stretch
of
a
route
march
that
his
strength
failed
him
suddenly
and
he
knew
that
he
could
do
no
more
his
pack
was
a
mountain
his
body
was
an
ache
and
a
blackness
closed
upon
his
eyes
he
fought
very
gallantly
to
save
himself
and
by
the
dogged
effort
of
his
will
kept
going
for
a
few
minutes
more
i
can
do
ten
steps
he
told
himself
and
counted
each
step
as
he
took
it
then
the
first
ten
accomplished
now
i
can
do
ten
more
so
he
kept
going
for
a
few
yards
more
and
dragged
foot
after
foot
till
he
had
reached
the
tale
of
two
hundred
at
which
staggered
fell
out
of
the
ranks
in
a
faint
and
was
brought
back
to
camp
on
a
stretcher
that
was
the
end
of
his
soldiering
with
pack
and
rifle
from
the
day
of
his
breakdown
on
the
route
march
his
platoon
knew
him
no
more
and
when
he
came
out
of
hospital
some
three
weeks
later
he
was
put
on
to
clerical
duties
as
clerk
he
handled
a
typewriter
instead
of
a
bayonet
and
handled
it
steadily
as
the
months
lengthened
into
years
others
his
contemporaries
completed
their
training
left
the
camp
and
went
off
to
the
front
he
remained
at
first
savagely
resentful
and
later
sullenly
resigned
his
conception
of
soldiering
derived
as
it
was
from
his
own
brief
and
fiery
experience
in
belgium
from
the
descriptive
articles
of
war
correspondents
and
his
reading
of
bygone
campaigns
had
never
included
the
soldier
who
was
merely
a
clerk
he
had
never
realized
that
a
man
in
uniform
was
not
necessarily
a
man
of
blood
the
revelation
came
to
him
only
when
he
copied
letters
and
routine
orders
filed
papers
and
for
all
practical
purposes
was
back
at
his
desk
in
the
insurance
office
his
daily
duties
mocked
and
derided
the
hopes
and
ambitions
wherewith
he
had
joined
the
army
and
ticking
at
his
typewriter
he
contrasted
the
blank
reality
with
the
strenuous
and
highly
coloured
dream
one
phase
of
that
then
ridiculous
shown
him
to
himself
as
the
hero
of
some
bloody
enterprise
and
the
central
figure
of
such
a
scene
as
he
had
read
of
in
napoleonic
history
a
scene
of
and
public
praise
in
token
of
duty
bravely
done
he
had
pictured
it
often
awake
and
asleep
and
fancied
griselda
looking
down
slowly
under
the
benumbing
influence
of
office
routine
his
revengeful
ambitions
faded
and
with
them
his
hope
of
emulating
murat
and
augereau
his
interest
in
the
war
had
been
fundamentally
a
personal
interest
and
though
there
had
grown
up
in
him
by
force
of
circumstance
a
tardy
consciousness
of
his
englishry
it
was
hardly
strong
enough
to
inspire
him
with
pride
in
a
humble
and
wearisome
duty
done
in
the
name
of
england
be
it
said
in
excuse
for
him
that
few
men
could
feel
pride
in
the
labour
of
dealing
with
daily
official
duty
of
copying
out
vain
repetitions
and
assisting
in
the
waste
of
good
paper
the
stilted
uselessness
of
half
the
documents
was
evident
even
to
william
and
there
were
moments
when
he
told
himself
in
savage
discontent
that
he
would
have
been
less
unprofitable
in
civilian
idleness
than
busied
in
promoting
futility
for
a
time
he
was
jolted
out
of
his
rut
by
his
transfer
to
france
in
the
august
of
he
was
drafted
out
at
a
few
hours
notice
with
a
batch
of
men
destined
for
clerical
duties
and
found
himself
planted
in
a
small
french
town
round
which
camps
were
spreading
in
a
fringe
of
tent
and
hutment
and
where
house
after
house
was
being
rapidly
annexed
for
the
service
of
the
british
army
but
save
for
change
of
scene
and
country
the
new
rut
into
which
he
had
been
jolted
was
twin
to
his
old
rut
in
england
it
was
the
same
clerk
s
time
in
the
office
of
a
military
with
longer
and
more
irregular
hours
than
fall
to
the
lot
of
the
ordinary
civilian
clerk
and
with
restrictions
on
personal
freedom
unknown
since
his
days
in
the
city
the
army
kept
him
as
tightly
as
his
mother
demanded
as
regular
hours
and
refused
as
steadfastly
as
she
had
done
to
let
him
wander
o
nights
he
filed
he
copied
he
ate
his
from
the
beaten
track
of
his
everyday
life
the
war
seemed
very
far
away
sometimes
in
his
afternoon
or
evening
he
would
tramp
up
the
hills
that
held
the
little
town
as
in
a
cup
to
a
point
where
looking
eastward
he
could
see
the
sudden
flashes
of
the
guns
the
bright
fierce
flashes
in
the
evening
sky
were
war
real
war
made
visible
and
wickedly
beautiful
such
war
as
he
had
seen
in
the
ardennes
village
and
such
as
he
had
dreamed
of
fighting
when
he
first
donned
his
khaki
tunic
and
instead
a
chair
and
a
typewriter
in
the
rue
ernest
dupont
the
papers
to
be
filed
that
a
girl
might
have
filed
the
round
of
safe
and
disciplined
monotony
that
was
war
as
he
knew
it
an
office
with
flashes
in
the
distance
for
a
few
days
after
his
arrival
in
france
his
new
surroundings
interested
cobbled
roads
the
build
of
the
houses
the
sound
of
french
in
the
streets
but
once
their
strangeness
had
worn
off
he
accepted
and
ceased
to
notice
them
he
was
not
sufficiently
educated
sufficiently
imaginative
or
observant
to
take
at
anything
beyond
their
the
various
and
incongruous
types
of
humanity
with
which
he
was
brought
into
contact
the
strange
life
of
northern
france
affected
him
only
where
it
touched
him
personally
and
to
him
the
sight
of
a
turbaned
brown
trooper
bargaining
in
the
with
a
frenchwoman
was
an
oddity
and
nothing
more
just
as
the
flamboyant
façade
of
the
great
church
of
nicholas
was
an
oddity
a
building
unlike
in
its
mass
and
its
detail
of
statuary
to
the
churches
he
knew
of
in
london
he
came
across
many
such
having
no
meaning
for
him
they
made
but
a
passing
impression
after
a
week
or
two
he
no
longer
turned
his
head
at
the
sight
of
a
gang
of
annamite
labourers
or
the
passing
of
a
detachment
of
german
prisoners
marched
campwards
at
the
end
of
their
day
these
things
like
the
ambulances
crawling
in
a
convoy
from
the
station
like
the
shuttered
french
houses
built
squarely
round
courtyards
became
part
of
the
background
of
his
daily
life
and
he
ceased
to
wonder
or
reflect
on
them
perhaps
his
contact
with
alien
races
with
strange
buildings
and
habits
once
unknown
may
have
increased
his
vague
sense
of
the
impossibility
of
fitting
all
men
to
one
pattern
and
of
solving
the
problems
of
human
misgovernment
and
government
by
means
of
the
simple
and
sweeping
expedients
he
had
once
been
so
glib
in
upholding
but
on
the
whole
it
left
him
unaffected
because
little
interested
his
course
of
free
library
reading
had
placed
him
in
possession
of
certain
scattered
facts
concerning
france
facts
dealing
chiefly
with
the
first
napoleon
and
the
german
war
of
but
for
all
the
hot
interest
they
had
stirred
in
him
once
they
gave
him
small
insight
into
the
forces
that
had
gone
to
the
making
of
the
country
in
which
his
life
was
spent
wearily
he
was
lacking
entirely
in
the
historical
sense
the
sense
that
makes
dead
men
alive
thus
in
connection
with
the
doings
of
frenchmen
his
odds
and
ends
of
historical
reading
had
little
more
meaning
to
him
than
the
late
gothic
carving
on
the
ornate
portal
of
nicholas
the
phase
of
warfare
with
which
france
familiarized
him
was
not
only
secure
and
uneventful
as
far
as
the
native
was
concerned
it
was
likewise
prosperous
the
town
where
he
plodded
through
his
daily
toil
was
blessed
as
never
before
in
the
matter
of
trade
and
turnover
commercially
it
blossomed
and
bore
good
fruit
in
the
deadly
shade
of
the
upas
tree
the
camps
and
the
offices
meant
custom
to
its
citizens
and
whatever
the
toll
in
the
blood
of
its
sons
it
gained
in
its
pocket
by
the
war
the
germans
in
had
threatened
but
barely
entered
it
it
had
neither
damage
to
repair
nor
extorted
indemnity
to
recoup
and
money
flowed
freely
to
the
palms
of
its
inhabitants
from
the
pockets
of
the
british
soldier
its
neighbours
a
few
miles
away
lay
in
hopeless
ruin
their
industries
annihilated
their
inhabitants
scattered
their
very
outlines
to
death
by
that
same
chance
of
war
which
had
spared
the
city
in
the
cup
of
the
hills
and
exalted
her
financial
horn
here
were
neither
misery
nor
the
local
shopkeeper
was
solidly
content
the
local
innkeeper
banked
cheerfully
and
often
the
local
farmer
sold
his
produce
to
advantage
and
the
volume
of
trade
in
the
district
expanded
and
burst
new
channels
broke
out
into
english
announcements
concerning
eggs
fried
potatoes
and
vegetables
english
newspapers
were
plentiful
as
french
in
the
shops
and
small
boys
cried
them
in
the
streets
and
when
the
weekly
market
gathered
in
the
shadow
of
nicholas
to
the
stalls
for
hardware
fruit
and
cheap
finery
were
added
the
stalls
that
did
a
roaring
business
in
souvenirs
for
the
english
markets
his
days
were
steadfastly
regular
and
steadfastly
monotonous
each
morning
by
eight
he
was
seated
in
the
office
in
the
rue
ernest
dupont
in
a
roomy
house
most
provincially
french
built
round
a
paved
courtyard
and
entered
from
the
street
by
an
archway
a
projecting
board
at
the
side
of
the
archway
bore
the
accumulation
of
letters
which
denoted
the
department
by
which
the
house
had
been
annexed
and
on
the
door
of
the
room
where
william
laboured
was
the
legend
letters
and
enquiries
at
twelve
he
knocked
off
for
dinner
and
was
his
own
master
till
three
then
the
office
again
till
supper
and
after
good
luck
till
ten
with
bad
luck
indefinite
overtime
on
sundays
he
was
his
own
master
for
the
space
of
an
afternoon
and
now
and
again
there
were
parades
and
now
and
again
the
late
pass
that
entitled
to
an
evening
at
liberty
when
he
first
arrived
he
was
fed
and
roofed
in
one
of
the
camps
on
the
borders
of
the
little
city
later
with
fellows
he
slept
and
messed
in
the
upper
rooms
of
the
building
in
which
he
did
his
daily
work
it
was
a
life
of
bleak
order
and
meticulous
safe
regularity
poles
apart
from
his
civilian
forecast
of
the
doings
of
a
man
of
war
there
was
small
thrill
of
personal
danger
about
its
soldiering
the
little
city
at
the
front
was
far
less
exposed
to
the
malice
of
enemies
than
london
or
the
east
coast
of
england
and
almost
the
only
indication
of
possible
peril
was
the
occasional
printed
notice
displayed
in
a
citizen
s
window
to
the
effect
that
within
was
a
cellar
at
the
disposition
of
the
public
in
case
of
alarm
aircraft
once
or
twice
during
the
first
year
that
william
dwelt
there
the
section
grew
clamorous
on
its
hills
and
spat
loudly
at
specks
in
the
after
a
few
minutes
receded
to
the
east
while
the
city
settled
down
without
injury
the
men
in
the
town
and
quartered
in
the
camps
outside
it
were
for
the
most
part
men
of
the
of
labour
companies
or
veterinary
service
to
whom
the
monotony
of
daily
existence
was
a
deadlier
foe
than
the
german
his
life
had
been
unusually
clean
partly
no
doubt
from
inclination
to
cleanliness
but
partly
through
influence
of
circumstance
while
his
mother
lived
he
had
small
opportunity
for
dissipation
even
of
the
mildest
variety
and
hard
on
her
death
had
come
the
great
new
interests
which
his
friendship
with
faraday
opened
to
him
those
interests
had
been
so
engrossing
that
he
had
little
energy
to
spare
from
them
all
his
hopes
and
pleasures
were
bound
up
in
his
causes
and
the
very
violence
of
his
political
enthusiasms
had
saved
him
from
physical
temptation
thus
he
had
come
to
griselda
and
sound
and
even
when
his
causes
and
his
wife
were
lost
the
habit
of
years
still
clung
to
him
and
the
follies
that
came
easily
to
others
would
have
needed
an
effort
in
him
once
or
twice
in
the
soddenness
of
his
discontent
he
was
tempted
to
turn
to
the
gross
pleasures
of
drink
and
worse
in
which
others
found
distraction
from
their
dullness
but
the
temptation
was
never
an
urgent
one
and
there
was
no
great
merit
in
his
resistance
one
night
he
overdrank
himself
in
a
deliberate
attempt
at
he
was
violently
sick
crawled
to
bed
throbbing
with
headache
and
did
not
repeat
the
experience
he
felt
himself
drifting
mentally
and
to
his
credit
made
efforts
to
save
himself
tried
to
awaken
an
interest
in
the
french
language
bought
a
dictionary
and
and
attended
classes
in
a
neighbouring
hut
he
spent
a
certain
amount
of
his
leisure
in
the
hut
borrowing
books
from
its
library
listening
to
its
concerts
and
now
and
again
making
one
at
a
game
of
draughts
he
made
no
real
because
he
was
not
in
the
mood
for
making
any
with
his
comrades
of
the
office
he
got
on
well
enough
but
there
was
no
such
tie
between
him
and
them
as
had
existed
between
him
and
the
men
of
his
mess
in
the
days
when
he
first
donned
his
uniform
the
hope
deferred
that
had
sickened
his
heart
had
driven
him
in
upon
himself
then
his
was
obviously
well
within
his
powers
and
outwardly
there
was
nothing
about
him
to
call
for
special
sympathy
and
kindliness
his
fellows
mostly
looked
on
him
as
a
harmless
uncompanionable
chap
who
preferred
to
be
left
to
himself
by
degrees
william
tully
was
moulded
to
the
narrow
little
life
departmental
and
lived
through
its
duties
and
hours
of
leisure
taking
not
much
thought
for
the
morrow
in
the
rue
ernest
dupont
the
war
seemed
much
smaller
much
farther
away
than
it
had
seemed
at
home
in
england
and
absorbed
in
its
minor
machinery
he
could
no
longer
consider
it
as
a
whole
the
office
and
the
daily
details
of
the
office
the
companions
he
worked
with
disliked
and
liked
loomed
larger
in
his
eyes
than
the
crash
of
armies
or
the
doings
of
men
at
the
front
as
a
civilian
he
had
wrestled
with
strategy
and
pored
over
maps
as
a
soldier
of
england
he
could
not
see
the
wood
for
the
trees
and
if
he
did
not
fall
mentally
to
the
level
of
that
species
of
surgeon
to
whom
war
is
an
agency
for
the
provision
of
interesting
cases
it
was
merely
because
unlike
the
surgeon
he
had
little
enthusiasm
for
his
work
inevitably
with
the
passing
of
month
after
month
the
memory
of
griselda
grew
less
poignant
and
with
the
soothing
of
his
sense
of
loss
there
came
about
also
inevitably
a
cooling
of
his
fury
for
instant
and
personal
revenge
he
had
not
forgiven
and
would
never
forget
but
he
no
longer
agonized
at
his
helplessness
to
strike
a
blow
in
part
perhaps
because
the
discipline
under
which
he
lived
had
weakened
his
power
of
initiative
though
he
chafed
under
discipline
he
learned
to
depend
on
it
and
became
accustomed
to
the
daily
ordering
of
his
life
and
his
early
training
in
the
insurance
office
stood
him
in
good
stead
so
that
he
performed
his
duties
with
the
necessary
efficiency
and
smartness
what
remained
with
him
long
after
the
memory
of
his
dead
wife
had
ceased
to
be
an
wound
was
the
sense
of
having
been
fooled
by
he
knew
not
whom
of
having
been
trapped
and
held
by
false
pretences
the
fact
that
his
grievance
was
vague
did
not
lessen
its
bitterness
it
lay
too
deep
for
the
grousing
that
he
heard
from
others
and
for
the
most
he
nursed
it
in
silence
the
silence
of
smouldering
rebellion
there
were
moments
when
his
face
must
have
been
more
communicative
than
his
tongue
for
one
sunday
an
early
spring
sunday
as
he
sat
on
a
hill
above
the
town
and
stared
vaguely
at
the
skyline
a
man
addressed
him
with
are
you
feeling
like
that
mate
and
squatted
on
the
grass
beside
him
a
lean
young
man
with
a
worn
brown
lined
on
the
forehead
and
with
eyes
like
a
sailor
s
accustomed
to
looking
at
distances
i
m
like
it
myself
he
went
on
without
waiting
for
an
answer
and
stretched
himself
out
on
to
his
elbow
these
last
few
days
it
s
been
almost
beyond
holding
in
it
s
the
spring
i
suppose
the
good
road
weather
and
the
sun
i
don
t
mind
it
so
much
when
there
s
mud
and
the
country
doesn
t
grin
at
you
i
can
stand
it
well
enough
then
lying
stretched
on
his
elbow
he
began
to
talk
about
himself
he
was
and
he
had
begun
his
career
at
a
there
just
long
enough
to
save
up
his
fare
and
a
few
pounds
to
start
him
in
canada
after
that
came
a
his
thinking
but
a
shade
less
narrow
than
the
office
to
be
left
for
the
rolling
the
shifting
life
the
only
life
worth
living
he
had
had
his
ups
he
had
had
his
always
with
his
eyes
on
the
distance
ten
fine
years
of
it
american
african
australian
the
life
independent
where
you
shouldered
your
pack
and
gave
men
the
when
you
were
sick
of
them
and
then
in
the
summer
of
a
fancy
to
see
the
old
country
he
had
worked
his
passage
homeward
in
a
tramp
and
arrived
at
tilbury
on
the
day
the
kaiser
s
government
sent
its
ultimatum
to
russia
four
days
later
he
was
a
soldier
in
the
british
army
and
a
year
or
so
later
had
a
damaged
and
a
shoulder
put
out
of
action
they
had
patched
him
up
carefully
made
quite
a
decent
job
of
him
and
he
walked
and
moved
his
left
arm
with
comfort
but
adjudged
unfit
for
the
fighting
line
he
had
done
with
the
trenches
for
good
permanent
base
now
with
a
cushy
job
at
the
office
of
the
of
works
filing
and
copying
documents
relating
to
hut
construction
he
had
been
fool
enough
to
let
out
that
he
had
had
some
small
training
as
a
clerk
in
a
way
he
said
chewing
at
a
long
blade
of
grass
it
s
a
good
thing
i
ve
got
my
stiff
knee
if
i
could
put
the
miles
under
me
as
i
used
to
i
believe
i
d
go
it
would
come
over
me
and
i
d
go
not
that
i
want
to
desert
but
it
might
be
too
strong
for
me
i
ve
always
been
my
own
master
and
i
ve
always
wanted
to
know
what
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
hill
straight
on
pointed
straight
on
anywhere
the
you
ve
once
tramped
it
he
broke
off
and
stared
with
his
eyes
on
the
distance
and
beyond
it
after
a
minute
or
two
of
silence
he
asked
william
suddenly
what
had
made
him
join
the
army
and
william
gave
him
confidence
for
confidence
attracted
he
knew
not
why
the
man
s
craving
for
loneliness
and
bodily
exertion
was
something
he
could
not
understand
but
they
were
on
common
ground
in
their
mutual
rebellion
against
the
weariness
of
daily
life
they
talked
with
long
silences
in
between
their
speech
telling
out
their
hearts
to
each
other
or
rather
finding
in
each
other
s
presence
an
excuse
for
speaking
their
hearts
later
it
seemed
odd
to
william
that
though
they
spoke
freely
of
their
lives
and
their
griefs
it
had
never
struck
either
of
them
to
ask
of
the
other
his
name
so
you
joined
up
because
of
your
wife
said
the
man
who
lay
on
his
elbow
yes
william
answered
him
i
he
did
not
finish
the
sentence
it
wearied
him
now
to
remember
what
he
had
thought
sometimes
the
other
broke
the
silence
i
ask
myself
why
i
joined
up
don
t
see
how
it
could
have
been
patriotism
england
hadn
t
been
anything
to
me
for
years
my
sister
died
soon
after
i
left
it
and
i
hadn
t
any
one
else
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
it
never
was
much
to
me
i
was
always
unhappy
in
england
hated
school
and
office
and
lived
in
a
town
never
knew
what
life
could
be
till
i
got
away
from
it
say
the
germans
had
won
and
dominated
the
earth
they
wouldn
t
have
dominated
my
earth
i
could
always
have
made
myself
a
where
they
wouldn
t
have
wanted
to
follow
me
if
they
d
sacked
london
and
swallowed
up
new
york
i
could
have
lain
out
under
the
stars
at
night
and
laughed
at
em
so
what
made
me
some
say
man
s
a
fighting
animal
he
pulled
a
fresh
to
chew
and
rolled
over
on
his
chest
till
his
chin
rested
on
his
hands
i
knew
i
should
hate
made
no
mistake
about
that
the
s
too
regular
for
me
i
ve
tried
it
more
than
once
for
the
sake
of
getting
somewhere
and
before
the
voyage
was
half
over
i
d
always
had
more
than
enough
i
knew
i
should
hate
it
but
i
joined
up
straight
and
away
i
ve
lost
everything
that
made
life
good
to
me
other
chaps
and
think
i
d
got
off
easily
so
i
have
i
daresay
but
then
it
isn
t
every
one
whose
life
was
in
moving
on
often
when
i
was
alone
i
ve
shouted
and
laughed
just
to
feel
how
my
legs
moved
under
me
it
s
the
even
if
i
were
out
of
it
i
m
a
lame
thing
when
the
war
ends
i
m
a
lame
thing
not
what
most
people
would
call
crippled
of
course
i
can
walk
a
few
miles
and
feed
myself
and
to
look
at
me
you
wouldn
t
know
there
was
anything
at
all
the
matter
if
i
were
a
townsman
it
wouldn
t
make
very
much
difference
if
i
d
stayed
a
clerk
i
could
go
on
being
a
clerk
but
i
can
t
be
what
i
was
i
ve
lost
everything
that
made
life
good
to
me
what
for
i
can
t
remember
exactly
the
feeling
i
had
about
it
when
i
made
me
do
it
so
many
things
have
happened
since
then
but
i
know
i
didn
t
think
about
it
long
so
far
as
i
remember
i
didn
t
hesitate
not
for
a
minute
i
went
straight
off
the
morning
after
war
was
declared
midnight
fourth
we
were
at
war
and
midday
fifth
i
was
a
soldier
must
have
been
some
sort
of
instinct
sometimes
i
tell
myself
what
a
blazing
fool
i
am
that
s
sometimes
other
he
was
silent
for
so
long
that
william
concluded
the
flow
of
his
confidence
had
ceased
when
you
live
in
a
crowd
he
said
at
last
you
can
always
make
excuses
for
yourself
most
likely
you
don
t
need
to
if
you
re
a
fool
or
a
coward
you
herd
with
a
lot
of
other
fools
and
cowards
and
you
all
back
each
other
up
so
you
never
come
face
to
face
with
yourself
the
idea
was
new
to
william
and
a
year
or
two
ago
he
would
have
repelled
it
because
it
was
new
now
he
turned
his
eyes
from
the
horizon
curiously
to
the
lean
brown
face
at
his
elbow
no
he
said
interrogatively
if
said
the
other
if
i
had
gone
back
it
wouldn
t
have
been
the
same
it
couldn
t
have
been
if
you
live
that
way
there
s
two
things
you
can
t
do
without
a
good
strong
body
to
stand
rain
and
wind
and
work
and
a
mind
you
re
not
afraid
to
be
alone
with
when
you
re
miles
from
any
one
in
the
woods
at
night
you
want
to
be
good
company
for
yourself
if
i
d
turned
my
back
on
it
all
i
mightn
t
have
been
very
good
company
i
ve
done
plenty
of
things
to
set
the
parsons
praying
over
me
if
i
told
em
i
ve
been
a
fool
times
out
of
mind
and
ashamed
of
it
afterwards
he
slid
into
a
silence
that
lasted
until
william
took
up
the
word
not
in
answer
or
argument
but
irrelevantly
so
that
he
too
might
talk
out
his
heart
do
you
know
what
i
think
i
am
sometimes
a
rat
in
a
a
squirrel
spinning
round
in
a
cage
very
busy
doing
nothing
i
ll
tell
you
one
of
the
things
i
ve
been
doing
word
of
it
truth
i
ve
been
typing
a
long
correspondence
about
a
worker
in
one
of
the
religious
organizations
who
came
into
the
town
ten
miles
by
train
to
get
stores
he
wanted
for
his
hut
the
rule
is
civilians
mustn
t
travel
by
train
without
a
movement
order
from
the
there
isn
t
an
in
the
place
he
comes
from
so
he
went
to
the
military
and
got
an
de
he
came
all
right
but
it
s
de
should
only
be
given
to
a
soldier
one
of
the
s
on
duty
at
the
station
reported
there
s
been
strafing
and
strafing
and
strafing
reams
written
about
ve
written
em
not
only
about
the
de
but
about
who
the
correspondence
is
to
go
s
office
or
the
base
commandant
or
some
one
else
after
three
or
four
weeks
it
was
referred
to
and
some
one
there
wrote
to
the
secretary
of
the
organization
asking
for
an
naturally
he
answered
the
letter
well
that
was
irregular
too
he
oughtn
t
to
have
answered
because
the
matter
should
have
been
dealt
with
gone
through
the
proper
so
more
correspondence
and
strafing
sheets
of
of
they
say
it
s
scarce
and
in
the
end
nothing
when
the
wretched
people
wrote
and
asked
exactly
what
they
were
to
they
were
to
get
a
movement
order
from
an
when
there
wasn
t
an
to
give
it
we
wrote
back
and
said
this
correspondence
must
now
i
ticked
it
out
on
my
typewriter
i
believe
you
the
other
nodded
i
ve
seen
something
of
that
sort
myself
and
the
papers
say
your
country
wants
you
and
it
goes
on
said
william
day
after
day
i
m
always
nothing
attention
is
directed
to
the
return
called
for
in
the
form
shown
as
the
third
good
lord
cried
the
other
stop
it
that
s
just
what
maddens
don
t
want
to
think
of
it
william
laughed
sullenly
with
his
chin
resting
on
his
hand
i
ve
not
much
else
to
think
of
he
said
he
watched
the
lean
man
down
the
hill
till
a
winding
of
the
road
hid
him
and
then
he
too
rose
in
his
turn
and
went
back
to
the
the
wherein
he
made
war
the
war
was
well
past
its
third
anniversary
when
william
again
met
edith
haynes
the
silence
once
broken
between
them
they
had
corresponded
with
a
fair
regularity
and
leave
being
due
to
him
he
wrote
to
ask
if
he
should
be
likely
to
meet
her
in
london
receiving
in
answer
a
hearty
invitation
to
pass
as
much
of
his
leave
as
he
could
whole
of
it
if
he
her
mother
and
herself
in
somerset
the
reply
was
an
eager
acceptance
hitherto
his
leave
if
a
respite
from
the
office
had
been
dreary
enough
in
comparison
with
the
of
other
was
a
suspicion
of
the
loneliness
in
which
it
was
usually
passed
that
had
prompted
edith
s
invitation
she
met
him
at
the
station
and
drove
him
home
and
they
picked
up
their
odd
friendship
at
the
point
where
they
had
left
it
off
the
only
other
member
of
the
family
with
whom
he
made
acquaintance
was
a
delicate
pale
mother
given
since
her
firstborn
was
killed
at
thiepval
to
long
silences
and
lonely
brooding
a
younger
son
had
been
a
prisoner
since
the
surrender
at
kut
and
edith
ran
her
mother
as
well
as
the
house
and
the
estate
she
looked
older
and
by
more
than
the
passing
of
three
years
the
iron
of
war
had
entered
into
her
soul
for
the
brother
killed
in
france
had
been
her
darling
as
well
as
her
mother
s
but
in
other
ways
she
was
just
what
william
remembered
her
a
kindly
and
capable
good
comrade
the
delicate
pale
mother
kept
much
to
her
room
and
the
pair
in
consequence
were
left
often
to
each
other
s
tramping
the
home
farm
with
edith
bent
on
bailiff
s
duties
sometimes
sitting
by
the
evening
fire
for
the
first
day
or
two
he
was
not
perhaps
in
mere
pleasure
in
his
new
surroundings
but
even
through
the
stiffness
and
restraint
of
his
letters
she
had
guessed
at
something
of
the
change
that
had
come
over
him
and
when
he
showed
signs
of
emerging
from
his
shell
she
took
pains
on
her
side
to
draw
him
out
and
discover
his
attitude
of
mind
by
degrees
from
his
silences
as
much
as
from
his
speech
she
learned
of
the
weariness
that
had
settled
like
a
mist
on
his
soul
the
aimlessness
with
which
he
plodded
the
pathway
of
his
disciplined
life
she
knew
him
for
a
man
disillusioned
in
whom
the
imaginings
of
his
days
had
died
as
completely
as
his
faith
in
his
creed
had
the
lot
fallen
to
him
he
would
not
have
shrunk
from
his
turn
in
the
trenches
and
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
for
griselda
s
sake
there
was
always
a
smoulder
of
hatred
but
he
had
seen
much
of
the
war
machine
had
realized
keenly
his
own
unimportance
therein
and
he
blushed
when
he
remembered
that
he
had
once
imagined
that
his
one
small
arm
and
his
private
vengeance
might
be
factors
and
important
factors
in
the
downfall
of
the
german
empire
and
the
first
mad
impulse
of
agony
the
impulse
which
would
have
sent
him
into
battle
had
passed
as
it
was
bound
to
pass
if
she
suspected
him
at
first
of
a
drift
towards
his
former
pacifism
she
soon
discovered
her
mistake
the
one
rock
on
which
he
stood
fast
was
that
conviction
of
error
which
had
come
to
him
in
the
forest
of
arden
he
hated
the
war
as
it
affected
himself
was
weary
of
the
war
in
general
all
he
longed
for
was
its
ending
which
meant
his
release
from
imprisonment
but
neither
hatred
nor
weariness
had
blinded
his
eyes
to
the
folly
of
that
other
blindness
which
had
denied
that
war
could
be
his
contempt
for
his
past
dreams
of
a
s
baton
was
as
nothing
to
his
contempt
for
those
further
past
dreams
wherein
fact
was
dispelled
by
a
theory
and
he
had
in
his
own
words
no
use
for
a
pacifist
party
which
had
never
as
he
had
made
confession
of
its
fundamental
error
he
was
still
in
his
heart
a
soldier
even
though
a
soldier
disillusioned
his
weariness
of
the
military
machine
his
personal
grievance
against
it
were
not
to
be
compared
to
the
fiery
conversion
that
had
followed
on
the
outbreak
of
war
the
one
concerned
matters
of
detail
only
the
other
his
fundamental
faith
so
much
edith
haynes
understood
from
their
intimate
fragmentary
talks
one
change
in
himself
he
had
not
noticed
till
edith
half
jestingly
spoke
of
it
an
affection
that
was
almost
a
tenderness
for
the
actual
soil
of
england
more
than
once
when
he
walked
with
her
he
contrasted
the
road
or
the
landscape
with
those
grown
familiar
in
france
and
the
contrast
was
always
in
favour
of
the
somerset
hills
or
the
winding
somerset
highway
without
ties
as
he
was
without
household
without
family
she
saw
that
he
shrank
from
the
idea
of
again
leaving
home
what
shall
you
do
when
the
war
is
over
she
asked
him
one
evening
as
his
leave
neared
its
end
curious
to
know
how
he
had
planned
to
spend
his
arrested
life
so
far
he
had
spoken
of
no
future
beyond
the
end
of
the
war
itself
and
when
she
put
to
him
the
question
direct
he
only
shook
his
head
vaguely
i
don
t
know
it
may
seem
odd
to
you
but
i
haven
t
thought
much
about
it
in
fact
smiled
i
don
t
believe
i
ve
really
thought
at
all
no
i
don
t
think
it
odd
she
told
him
there
are
a
good
many
like
m
inclined
to
think
that
you
re
only
one
of
the
majority
people
whose
business
it
is
to
reorganize
suppose
they
re
thinking
ahead
one
prays
they
are
but
as
for
the
rest
of
us
it
s
difficult
to
think
ahead
because
of
the
way
it
has
broken
up
our
lives
and
our
plans
we
ve
got
used
to
its
breaking
them
up
that
s
it
he
nodded
back
we
ve
been
made
to
do
things
for
so
long
taken
and
made
to
do
them
some
have
been
taken
and
killed
and
some
have
been
taken
and
some
have
only
been
made
prisoners
like
me
but
we
ve
all
of
us
been
bent
and
twisted
into
things
we
never
meant
to
be
so
we
don
t
s
the
use
i
might
of
m
not
like
the
men
in
the
trenches
who
may
be
killed
any
minute
i
m
safe
enough
where
i
than
in
london
but
all
the
same
i
don
t
i
just
wait
to
see
what
happens
for
a
week
before
william
left
england
there
had
been
expectation
of
coming
developments
at
the
front
and
the
papers
had
spoken
of
considerable
aerial
activity
on
the
enemy
s
side
as
on
ours
the
developments
commenced
in
earnest
on
the
day
of
his
return
from
leave
but
his
first
personal
experience
of
the
increase
in
aerial
activity
was
not
for
a
few
days
later
when
as
he
was
passing
through
the
square
in
the
centre
of
the
town
a
gun
thudded
then
another
he
stopped
and
made
one
of
a
little
knot
of
khaki
that
was
staring
up
into
the
blue
and
whereof
one
of
the
component
parts
was
a
corporal
who
worked
in
his
office
he
himself
could
see
nothing
but
a
drift
or
two
of
smoke
but
he
gathered
from
the
corporal
that
there
were
two
fritz
planes
overhead
and
he
stood
cricking
his
neck
and
blinking
upwards
in
the
strong
sunlight
while
made
groups
on
the
pavement
and
shopkeepers
issued
from
their
doors
he
had
seen
the
same
thing
happen
before
and
quite
harmlessly
no
one
around
him
seemed
alarmed
or
disturbed
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
guns
ceased
firing
as
the
aeroplanes
passed
out
of
range
photographing
said
the
corporal
as
they
walked
away
to
the
office
he
s
been
over
quite
a
lot
the
last
week
or
two
and
some
time
or
other
i
suppose
we
shall
have
him
in
earnest
it
s
a
wonder
to
me
he
s
left
us
alone
so
long
it
ud
be
worth
his
while
coming
even
if
he
didn
t
do
more
than
drop
a
bomb
or
two
on
the
and
start
a
few
hundred
horses
yes
agreed
william
i
suppose
it
would
he
was
not
in
the
least
alarmed
as
he
settled
down
to
his
files
since
he
joined
the
army
he
had
never
been
exposed
to
danger
and
security
had
become
with
him
a
habit
that
night
there
was
a
heavy
post
and
the
office
was
kept
working
late
it
was
close
on
eleven
when
william
was
called
upstairs
to
take
down
some
letters
from
dictation
the
officer
who
had
sent
for
him
was
clearing
his
throat
for
the
first
sentence
when
the
door
opened
for
the
announcement
local
aircraft
alarm
sir
oh
all
right
said
the
officer
resignedly
go
downstairs
tully
and
come
up
again
when
the
lights
go
on
probably
only
a
false
had
two
the
other
night
just
the
sort
of
thing
that
would
happen
when
we
re
behindhand
he
went
out
grumbling
and
william
followed
him
feeling
his
way
by
the
banisters
for
the
electric
light
was
turned
off
while
he
was
still
on
the
upper
landing
other
men
from
all
over
the
warren
of
a
building
were
descending
likewise
and
they
bumped
and
jostled
each
other
in
the
sudden
darkness
on
the
stairs
there
were
jests
as
they
bumped
and
much
creaking
of
which
while
william
was
still
a
flight
from
the
ground
floor
came
the
first
rapid
thudding
of
archie
on
it
a
moment
later
an
unmistakable
bomb
and
the
pattering
outburst
of
william
listened
curiously
it
was
his
first
experience
of
an
air
raid
and
though
the
pace
of
his
heart
quickened
as
yet
there
was
no
real
fear
in
him
but
a
man
pressed
against
him
by
the
descending
stream
gasped
audibly
and
clawed
round
william
s
arm
with
his
fingers
the
action
was
fear
made
manifest
in
darkness
and
william
instinctively
knowing
it
infectious
repelled
it
and
strove
to
free
his
wrist
but
the
shaking
fingers
eloquent
of
terror
only
clung
more
tightly
to
their
hold
what
is
it
william
snapped
what
s
the
matter
it
s
a
voice
whispered
back
in
jerks
i
can
t
help
lord
knows
i
try
but
i
can
t
if
it
was
shells
i
could
stand
em
a
gun
beat
down
his
voice
but
did
not
stop
at
dunkirk
i
was
buried
two
hours
two
mortal
hours
before
they
got
me
when
i
was
in
hospital
he
came
over
and
bombed
us
again
he
got
one
right
on
to
us
and
i
was
blown
out
of
bed
and
the
men
at
the
other
end
of
the
ward
were
in
pieces
in
pieces
i
tell
bits
of
william
tried
to
stand
that
the
man
must
cling
and
gibber
to
some
one
as
a
child
clings
and
wails
to
its
nurse
they
had
turned
into
a
room
on
the
ground
were
no
cellars
but
it
was
esteemed
the
safest
place
in
the
building
by
reason
of
the
comparative
absence
of
the
pair
of
them
stood
backs
against
the
wall
when
wright
stopped
was
not
could
hear
his
breath
as
it
came
whining
through
his
teeth
and
he
remembered
that
the
man
wore
the
ribbon
of
the
man
who
had
once
had
nerve
and
to
all
appearance
was
sound
but
who
had
not
sufficient
hold
on
himself
to
keep
his
terror
from
his
tongue
he
spoke
of
it
unceasingly
whenever
the
sounds
without
died
down
william
could
hear
him
of
the
night
when
he
was
bombed
in
hospital
and
now
of
the
building
they
were
in
it
was
no
good
as
a
crumble
like
a
house
of
cards
nothing
was
any
good
but
a
cellar
or
should
have
been
trenches
and
they
were
so
damnably
close
to
the
station
and
the
station
was
just
what
those
devils
were
trying
to
hit
there
came
a
moment
when
william
could
bear
it
no
more
and
wrenched
himself
free
of
the
clawing
fingers
on
his
sleeve
he
dared
not
feel
them
longer
lest
his
heart
also
melted
within
him
his
nervousness
took
the
form
of
a
difficulty
in
keeping
still
and
he
fidgeted
about
the
darkened
room
but
the
room
was
fairly
full
and
he
could
not
move
a
step
or
two
this
way
and
a
step
or
two
that
he
was
brought
up
by
a
solid
group
that
stretched
from
the
wall
to
a
table
he
came
to
a
standstill
on
the
edge
of
the
group
and
tried
to
listen
to
their
talk
forced
himself
to
listen
to
all
the
time
straining
his
ears
through
the
murmur
for
the
droning
of
the
gotha
engines
he
fought
with
himself
and
fought
more
manfully
than
he
knew
striving
to
thrust
out
of
his
mind
wright
s
phrase
about
the
beastly
bits
of
flesh
and
to
fasten
his
hearing
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
on
the
voice
of
a
man
his
neighbour
in
the
darkness
who
had
lately
seen
a
german
aeroplane
brought
down
and
having
apparently
some
mechanical
knowledge
was
describing
its
points
and
its
engines
they
the
engines
were
he
said
waxing
technical
but
even
if
he
had
not
been
told
it
he
should
have
guessed
from
the
fittings
of
the
plane
that
jerry
was
getting
a
bit
scarce
in
his
stock
of
rubber
and
leather
what
he
was
here
the
windows
rattled
loudly
and
drowned
him
that
s
pretty
close
some
one
commented
and
william
moved
a
restless
step
away
once
it
had
seemed
to
him
an
easy
thing
to
follow
griselda
and
die
now
all
the
moral
strength
he
possessed
went
into
the
effort
not
to
shrink
to
be
master
of
his
body
to
behave
decently
and
endure
that
was
all
that
seemed
to
be
steady
and
behave
that
for
all
his
fear
of
instant
death
he
never
turned
his
thoughts
to
god
he
had
not
known
how
beautiful
silence
could
be
till
it
came
almost
suddenly
like
a
flood
of
clear
cool
water
when
some
one
muttering
that
it
seemed
to
be
over
opened
the
door
and
went
out
into
the
courtyard
he
followed
and
stood
there
feeling
the
silence
as
something
clean
exquisite
and
grateful
his
hands
were
wet
and
hot
and
he
stretched
them
out
to
the
air
if
he
had
not
prayed
when
he
was
under
the
spell
of
fear
his
heart
at
his
release
from
it
was
filled
with
something
like
praise
listen
said
a
voice
in
his
ear
it
was
wright
his
face
uplifted
in
the
moonlight
and
disfigured
by
ugly
twitchings
listen
he
said
they
re
coming
back
william
shrank
from
him
irritably
but
the
man
had
not
spoken
particularly
to
him
and
having
spoken
turned
swiftly
and
went
back
into
the
house
he
had
been
the
first
to
catch
the
drone
which
as
they
stood
and
listened
grew
nearer
that
s
him
sure
enough
another
voice
agreed
coming
up
in
relays
he
ll
be
out
to
make
a
night
of
thought
we
d
got
rid
of
him
too
quickly
a
searchlight
wheeled
and
the
spoke
on
the
word
some
one
cried
got
im
and
pointed
and
for
an
instant
william
had
sight
of
a
wicked
thing
caught
in
the
ray
and
rushing
upwards
battery
and
gave
tongue
at
the
sight
but
in
a
flash
the
climbing
devil
had
vanished
and
the
searchlight
wheeled
after
it
fruitlessly
as
they
stood
and
watched
it
wheeling
a
voice
called
come
in
men
and
they
went
back
perforce
within
their
walls
the
first
attack
had
lasted
not
much
over
half
an
hour
this
time
the
ordeal
by
darkness
and
waiting
was
longer
william
held
himself
tightly
ashamed
of
the
weakness
with
which
wright
had
infected
him
and
keeping
it
doggedly
at
bay
he
talked
when
he
could
think
of
anything
to
talk
irrelevant
fragments
of
whatever
came
into
his
head
anything
to
keep
himself
from
listening
at
one
time
he
made
a
conscious
and
determined
effort
to
turn
his
talk
and
his
mind
with
it
to
something
unconnected
with
but
always
his
speech
like
that
of
his
companions
came
back
to
the
thought
of
the
moment
do
you
remember
he
asked
a
man
beside
him
what
a
fuss
there
was
about
the
first
channel
flight
i
forget
the
fellow
s
frenchman
some
one
supplied
the
name
bleriot
out
of
the
darkness
yes
s
it
queer
when
you
think
of
it
nobody
had
any
idea
then
what
it
would
into
cellars
and
hiding
in
the
dark
if
they
had
forced
an
attempt
at
a
they
wouldn
t
have
been
so
pleased
no
his
neighbour
agreed
with
him
jocularly
they
wouldn
t
have
been
so
pleased
we
thought
we
was
all
going
to
flap
about
like
instead
the
most
of
us
go
scuttling
into
holes
like
beetles
what
the
cook
s
trying
to
stamp
on
that
s
them
as
don
t
fly
yes
said
william
that
s
flying
the
beetle
simile
caught
his
fancy
oddly
and
he
found
himself
contrasting
it
with
his
old
idea
of
a
soldier
after
all
the
was
a
new
was
impossible
to
think
of
napoleonic
heroes
as
beetles
yet
if
they
were
alive
they
would
have
to
scuttle
murat
the
magnificent
and
ney
the
red
lion
when
the
next
war
comes
his
jocular
neighbour
was
continuing
every
man
that
ain
t
in
the
ull
be
crawling
at
the
bottom
of
a
and
i
don
t
mind
mentioning
in
confidence
that
if
i
saw
a
andy
i
wouldn
t
mind
crawling
down
it
now
no
said
william
for
the
sake
of
speaking
i
don
t
suppose
you
would
he
was
trying
to
think
of
something
further
to
say
when
he
felt
the
man
on
his
other
side
start
perceptibly
and
stiffen
in
attention
something
caught
at
his
throat
and
he
could
only
whisper
what
is
it
he
s
stopping
his
engine
said
the
other
quietly
and
before
william
had
time
to
ask
what
he
meant
the
next
bomb
fell
in
the
courtyard
there
was
only
one
man
wholly
wright
who
ran
out
splashed
with
other
men
s
blood
took
screaming
to
his
heels
and
collapsed
a
mile
along
the
road
there
he
lay
till
long
after
the
bell
of
nicholas
had
rung
an
all
clear
to
the
long
after
the
ambulances
telephoned
for
from
the
hospitals
outside
had
loaded
up
in
the
streets
across
which
cordons
had
been
drawn
by
military
police
and
french
firemen
men
and
fragments
of
men
were
taken
from
the
ruins
some
speedily
some
after
much
search
and
among
them
private
tully
past
terror
but
breathing
still
alive
but
only
alive
he
spoke
but
a
few
times
after
the
explosion
had
broken
him
and
the
men
who
lifted
him
on
a
stretcher
to
the
ambulance
and
out
of
it
could
see
that
he
suffered
not
at
all
the
shifting
and
handling
that
was
torture
to
others
left
his
maimed
and
mauled
body
unaffected
the
injury
to
the
spine
that
was
killing
him
had
bereft
him
of
the
power
of
pain
as
well
as
of
the
power
of
movement
and
in
the
hospital
where
a
few
minutes
drive
from
the
ruins
landed
him
he
lay
quietly
alive
for
a
day
or
two
for
the
most
part
dumb
and
unconscious
but
with
intervals
of
sense
and
lucid
speech
once
in
such
an
interval
he
whispered
to
the
nurse
that
his
wife
too
was
buried
in
france
whereby
she
saw
that
he
knew
he
was
about
to
die
later
he
asked
that
some
one
would
write
to
edith
haynes
and
tried
to
explain
who
she
was
no
a
lady
i
know
i
should
like
her
to
hear
the
last
person
he
spoke
to
was
a
chaplain
a
young
man
making
his
round
of
the
ward
who
seeing
intelligence
in
the
pale
blue
eyes
bent
over
the
bed
to
ask
if
there
was
anything
he
wanted
the
chaplain
had
been
warned
by
a
sister
that
here
was
a
hopeless
case
and
he
spoke
very
gently
and
bent
very
low
for
the
answer
it
drifted
out
faintly
in
a
slow
and
expressionless
whisper
no
thank
you
said
william
i
don
t
seem
to
have
been
much
good
but
there
comes
a
time
when
nothing
matters
not
even
asked
the
chaplain
feeling
his
way
the
sense
that
you
have
done
your
duty
most
people
do
that
said
william
the
question
is
if
you
ve
been
much
use
when
you
ve
done
it
the
chaplain
puzzled
said
something
of
infinite
mercy
and
the
standard
of
god
not
being
as
the
standard
of
man
if
you
ve
done
your
best
he
suggested
most
people
do
that
said
william
again
and
slid
back
once
more
into
silence
he
was
buried
without
mourners
save
those
detailed
for
the
duty
who
none
the
less
stiffened
in
salute
of
his
coffin
and
called
him
farewell
on
the
bugle
his
death
duly
entered
in
the
hospital
books
was
reported
to
the
casualty
department
and
the
graves
registration
clerks
took
note
of
his
burial
and
filed
it
