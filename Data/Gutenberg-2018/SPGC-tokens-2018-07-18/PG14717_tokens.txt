in
any
group
of
men
i
have
ever
known
speaking
from
the
point
of
view
of
character
and
not
that
of
physical
appearance
peter
would
stand
out
as
deliciously
and
irrefutably
different
in
the
great
waste
of
american
intellectual
dreariness
he
was
an
oasis
a
veritable
spring
in
the
desert
he
understood
life
he
knew
men
he
was
free
spiritually
morally
in
a
thousand
ways
it
seemed
to
me
as
one
drags
along
through
this
inexplicable
existence
one
realizes
how
such
qualities
stand
out
not
the
pseudo
freedom
of
strong
men
financially
or
physically
but
the
real
internal
spiritual
freedom
where
the
mind
as
it
were
stands
up
and
looks
at
itself
faces
nature
unafraid
is
aware
of
its
own
weaknesses
its
strengths
examines
its
own
and
the
creative
impulses
of
the
universe
and
of
men
with
a
kindly
and
eye
in
fact
kicks
dogma
out
of
doors
and
yet
deliberately
and
of
choice
holds
fast
to
many
many
simple
and
human
things
and
rounds
out
life
or
would
in
a
natural
normal
courageous
healthy
way
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
peter
was
in
louis
in
i
had
come
down
from
chicago
to
work
on
the
louis
and
he
was
a
part
of
the
art
department
force
of
that
paper
at
that
time
and
he
never
seemed
to
change
later
even
so
much
as
a
hair
worth
until
he
died
in
he
was
short
stocky
and
yet
quick
and
even
jerky
in
his
manner
with
a
bushy
of
hair
and
beard
most
swiftly
and
astonishingly
disposed
of
at
times
only
to
be
regrown
at
others
and
always
and
intentionally
i
am
sure
most
amusing
to
contemplate
in
addition
to
all
this
he
had
an
air
of
force
and
alertness
which
belied
the
other
surface
characteristics
as
anything
more
than
a
genial
pose
or
bit
of
idle
gayety
plainly
he
took
himself
seriously
and
yet
lightly
usually
with
an
air
of
suppressed
gayety
as
though
saying
this
whole
business
of
living
is
a
great
joke
he
always
wore
good
and
yet
exceedingly
mussy
clothes
at
times
bespattered
with
ink
or
worse
yet
even
soup
an
amazing
grotesquery
that
was
the
dismay
of
all
who
knew
him
friends
and
relatives
especially
in
addition
he
was
nearly
always
liberally
besprinkled
with
tobacco
dust
the
source
of
which
he
used
in
all
forms
in
pipe
cigar
and
plug
even
cigarettes
when
he
could
obtain
nothing
more
substantial
one
of
the
things
about
him
which
most
impressed
me
at
that
time
and
later
was
this
love
of
the
ridiculous
or
the
grotesque
in
himself
or
others
which
would
not
let
him
take
anything
in
a
dull
or
conventional
mood
would
not
even
permit
him
to
appear
normal
at
times
but
urged
him
on
to
all
sorts
of
nonsense
in
an
effort
i
suppose
to
entertain
himself
and
make
life
seem
less
commonplace
and
yet
he
loved
life
in
all
its
multiform
and
multiplex
aspects
and
with
no
desire
or
tendency
to
sniff
reform
or
improve
anything
it
was
good
just
as
he
found
it
excellent
life
to
peter
was
indeed
so
splendid
that
he
was
always
very
much
wrought
up
about
it
eager
to
live
to
study
to
do
a
thousand
things
for
him
it
was
a
workshop
for
the
artist
the
thinker
as
well
as
the
mere
grubber
and
without
really
criticizing
any
one
he
was
for
the
individual
who
is
able
to
understand
to
portray
or
to
create
life
either
feelingly
and
artistically
or
with
accuracy
and
discrimination
to
him
as
i
saw
then
and
see
even
more
clearly
now
there
was
no
high
and
no
low
all
things
were
only
relatively
so
a
thief
was
a
thief
but
he
had
his
place
ditto
the
murderer
ditto
the
saint
not
man
but
nature
was
planning
or
at
least
doing
something
which
man
could
not
understand
of
which
very
likely
he
was
a
mere
tool
peter
was
as
much
thrilled
and
entendered
by
the
brawling
strumpet
in
the
street
or
the
bagnio
as
by
the
virgin
with
her
starry
crown
the
rich
were
rich
and
the
poor
poor
but
all
were
in
the
grip
of
imperial
forces
whose
ruthless
purposes
or
lack
of
them
made
all
men
ridiculous
pathetic
or
magnificent
as
you
choose
he
pitied
ignorance
and
necessity
and
despised
vanity
and
cruelty
for
sake
and
the
miserly
hoarding
of
anything
he
was
liberal
material
sensual
and
yet
spiritual
and
although
he
never
had
more
than
a
little
money
out
of
the
richness
and
fullness
of
his
own
temperament
he
seemed
able
to
generate
a
kind
of
atmosphere
and
texture
in
his
daily
life
which
was
rich
and
warm
splendid
really
in
thought
the
true
reality
if
not
in
fact
and
most
grateful
to
all
yet
also
as
i
have
said
always
he
wished
to
the
clown
the
scapegrace
the
wanton
and
the
loon
even
mouthing
idle
impossibilities
at
times
and
declaring
his
profoundest
faith
in
the
most
fantastic
things
do
i
seem
to
rave
i
am
dealing
with
a
most
significant
person
in
so
far
as
i
knew
he
was
born
into
a
family
of
irish
extraction
whose
habitat
was
southwest
missouri
in
the
town
in
which
he
was
reared
there
was
not
even
a
railroad
until
he
was
fairly
well
grown
a
fact
which
amused
but
never
impressed
him
very
much
apropos
of
this
he
once
told
me
of
a
yokel
who
never
having
seen
a
railroad
entered
the
station
with
his
wife
and
children
long
before
train
time
bought
his
ticket
and
waited
a
while
looking
out
of
the
various
windows
then
finally
returned
to
the
and
asked
when
does
this
thing
start
he
meant
the
station
building
itself
at
the
time
peter
had
entered
upon
art
work
he
had
scarcely
prosecuted
his
studies
beyond
if
so
far
as
the
conventional
high
or
grammar
school
and
yet
he
was
most
amazingly
informed
and
but
little
interested
in
what
any
school
or
college
had
to
offer
his
father
curiously
enough
was
an
educated
a
lawyer
by
profession
and
a
catholic
his
mother
was
an
american
catholic
rather
strict
and
narrow
his
brothers
and
sisters
of
whom
there
were
four
were
as
i
learned
later
astonishingly
virile
and
interesting
americans
of
a
rather
wild
unsettled
type
they
were
all
in
so
far
as
i
could
judge
from
chance
meetings
agnostic
tense
so
vital
that
they
weighed
on
one
a
little
as
very
intense
temperaments
are
apt
to
do
one
of
the
brothers
k
who
seemed
to
seek
me
out
ever
so
often
for
sake
was
so
intense
nervous
that
he
frightened
me
a
little
he
loved
noisy
garish
places
he
liked
to
play
the
piano
stay
up
very
late
he
was
a
high
liver
a
good
dresser
as
the
denizens
of
the
tenderloin
would
say
an
excellent
example
of
the
flashy
clever
promoter
he
was
always
representing
a
new
company
introducing
something
a
table
or
laxative
water
a
shaving
soap
a
chewing
gum
a
safety
razor
a
bicycle
an
automobile
tire
or
the
machine
itself
he
was
here
there
everywhere
in
waukesha
wisconsin
san
francisco
new
york
new
orleans
my
my
this
is
certainly
interesting
he
would
exclaim
with
an
air
which
would
have
done
credit
to
a
comedian
and
extending
both
hands
peter
pet
friend
dreiser
well
well
well
let
have
a
drink
let
have
something
to
eat
only
in
town
for
a
day
maybe
you
like
to
go
to
a
show
or
hit
the
high
places
would
you
well
well
well
let
make
a
night
of
it
what
do
you
say
and
he
would
fix
me
with
a
glistening
nervous
and
what
was
intended
no
doubt
to
be
a
reassuring
eye
but
which
unsettled
me
as
thoroughly
as
the
imminence
of
an
earthquake
but
i
was
talking
of
peter
the
day
i
first
saw
him
he
was
bent
over
a
illustrating
a
snake
story
for
one
of
the
sunday
issues
of
the
which
apparently
delighted
in
regaling
its
readers
with
most
astounding
concoctions
of
this
kind
and
the
snake
he
was
drawing
was
most
disturbingly
vital
and
reptilian
with
distended
jaws
extended
tongue
most
fatefully
coiled
my
i
commented
in
passing
for
i
was
in
to
see
him
about
another
matter
what
a
glorious
snake
yes
you
ca
make
too
snaky
for
the
up
front
he
returned
rising
and
dusting
tobacco
from
his
lap
and
shirtfront
for
he
was
in
his
then
he
expectorated
not
in
but
to
one
side
of
a
handsome
polished
brass
cuspidor
which
contained
not
the
least
evidence
of
use
the
rubber
mat
upon
which
it
stood
being
instead
most
disturbingly
decorated
i
was
most
impressed
by
this
latter
fact
although
at
the
time
i
said
nothing
being
too
new
later
i
may
as
well
say
here
i
discovered
why
this
was
a
bit
of
his
clowning
humor
a
purely
manufactured
and
as
it
were
mechanical
joke
or
ebullience
of
soul
if
any
one
inadvertently
or
through
unfamiliarity
attempted
to
expectorate
in
his
golden
cuspidor
as
he
described
it
he
was
always
quick
to
rise
and
interpose
in
the
most
solemn
almost
sepulchral
manner
at
the
same
time
raising
a
hand
hold
out
not
in
to
one
side
on
the
mat
that
cost
me
seven
dollars
then
he
would
solemnly
seat
himself
and
begin
to
draw
again
i
saw
him
do
this
to
all
but
the
chiefest
of
the
authorities
of
the
paper
and
all
even
the
dullest
seemed
to
be
amused
quite
fascinated
by
the
utter
trumpery
folly
of
it
but
i
am
getting
ahead
of
my
tale
in
so
far
as
the
snake
was
concerned
he
was
referring
to
the
assistant
who
had
these
snake
stories
in
charge
the
fatter
and
more
venomous
and
more
scaly
they
are
he
went
on
the
better
i
like
it
if
we
could
use
a
little
color
in
this
paper
red
for
eyes
and
tongue
and
blue
and
green
for
scales
the
farmers
upstate
would
love
that
they
like
good
but
poisonous
snakes
then
he
grinned
stood
back
and
cocking
his
head
to
one
side
in
a
most
examining
and
yet
approving
manner
ran
his
hand
through
his
hair
and
beard
and
added
a
snake
ca
be
too
vital
you
know
for
this
paper
we
have
to
draw
strong
plenty
of
vitality
plenty
of
go
he
grinned
most
engagingly
i
could
not
help
laughing
of
course
the
impertinent
air
the
grand
almost
condescending
manner
we
soon
became
fast
friends
in
the
same
office
in
close
contact
with
him
was
another
person
one
d
w
also
a
newspaper
artist
who
while
being
exceedingly
interesting
and
special
in
himself
still
as
a
character
never
seems
to
have
served
any
greater
purpose
in
my
own
mind
than
to
have
illustrated
how
emphatic
and
important
peter
was
he
had
a
thin
pale
dantesque
face
coal
black
almost
hair
most
carefully
parted
in
the
middle
and
oiled
and
slicked
down
at
the
sides
and
back
until
it
looked
as
though
it
had
been
glued
his
eyes
were
small
and
black
and
querulous
but
not
mean
petted
eyes
they
were
and
the
mouth
had
little
lines
at
each
corner
which
seemed
to
say
he
had
endured
much
much
pain
which
of
course
he
had
not
but
which
nevertheless
seemed
to
ask
for
and
i
suppose
earned
him
some
sympathy
dick
in
his
way
was
an
actor
a
tragedian
of
sorts
but
with
an
element
of
humor
cynicism
and
insight
which
saved
him
from
being
utterly
ridiculous
like
most
actors
he
was
a
great
poseur
he
invariably
affected
the
long
loose
flowing
tie
with
a
soft
white
or
blue
or
green
or
brown
linen
shirt
would
any
american
imitation
of
the
quartier
latin
denizen
have
been
without
one
at
that
date
yellow
or
black
gloves
a
round
soft
crush
hat
very
soft
and
limp
and
very
patent
leather
pumps
betimes
a
capecoat
a
slender
cane
a
boutonnière
all
this
in
hard
smoky
noisy
commercial
louis
full
of
business
men
and
farmers
i
would
not
mention
this
particular
person
save
that
for
a
time
he
peter
and
myself
were
most
intimately
associated
we
temporarily
constituted
in
our
way
a
soldiers
three
of
the
newspaper
world
for
some
years
after
we
were
more
or
less
definitely
in
touch
as
a
group
although
later
peter
and
myself
having
drifted
eastward
and
as
a
pair
had
been
finding
more
and
more
in
common
and
had
more
and
more
come
to
view
dick
for
what
he
was
a
character
of
dickensian
or
perhaps
still
better
cruikshankian
proportions
and
qualities
but
in
those
days
the
three
of
us
were
all
but
inseparable
eating
working
playing
all
but
sleeping
together
i
had
a
studio
of
sorts
in
a
more
or
less
dilapidated
factory
section
of
louis
tenth
near
market
now
i
suppose
briskly
commercial
dick
had
one
at
broadway
and
locust
directly
opposite
the
then
famous
southern
hotel
peter
lived
with
his
family
on
the
south
side
a
most
respectable
and
neighborhood
it
has
been
one
of
my
commonest
experiences
and
one
of
the
most
interesting
to
me
to
note
that
nearly
all
of
my
keenest
experiences
intellectually
my
most
gorgeous
and
swiftest
developments
mentally
have
been
by
to
and
through
men
not
women
although
there
have
been
several
exceptions
to
this
nearly
every
turning
point
in
my
career
has
been
signalized
by
my
meeting
some
man
of
great
force
to
whom
i
owe
some
of
the
most
ecstatic
intellectual
hours
of
my
life
hours
in
which
life
seemed
to
bloom
forth
into
new
aspects
glowed
as
with
the
radiance
of
a
gorgeous
tropic
day
peter
was
one
such
about
my
own
age
at
this
time
he
was
blessed
with
a
natural
understanding
which
was
simply
godlike
although
like
myself
he
was
raised
a
catholic
and
still
pretending
in
a
boisterous
rabelaisian
way
to
have
some
reverence
for
that
faith
he
was
amusingly
sympathetic
to
everything
good
bad
indifferent
in
case
there
might
be
something
in
it
you
never
can
tell
still
he
had
the
least
interest
in
conforming
to
the
tenets
of
the
church
and
laughed
at
its
pretensions
preferring
his
own
theories
to
any
other
apparently
nothing
amused
him
so
much
as
the
thought
of
confession
and
communion
of
being
shrived
by
some
stout
healthy
priest
as
worldly
as
himself
and
preferably
irish
like
himself
at
the
same
time
he
had
a
hearty
admiration
for
the
germans
all
their
ways
conservatisms
their
breweries
food
and
such
things
and
finally
wound
up
by
marrying
a
german
girl
as
far
as
i
could
make
out
peter
had
no
faith
in
anything
except
nature
itself
and
very
little
in
that
except
in
those
aspects
of
beauty
and
accident
and
reward
and
terrors
with
which
it
is
filled
and
for
which
he
had
an
awe
if
not
a
reverence
and
in
every
manifestation
of
which
he
took
the
greatest
delight
life
was
a
delicious
brilliant
mystery
to
him
horrible
in
some
respects
beautiful
in
others
a
great
adventure
unlike
myself
at
the
time
he
had
not
the
slightest
trace
of
any
lingering
puritanism
and
wished
to
live
in
a
lush
vigorous
healthy
free
at
times
almost
barbaric
way
the
negroes
the
ancient
romans
the
egyptians
tales
of
the
orient
and
the
grotesque
dark
ages
our
own
vile
slums
and
evil
quarters
how
he
reveled
in
these
he
was
for
nights
of
wandering
endless
investigation
reading
singing
dancing
playing
apropos
of
this
i
should
like
to
relate
here
that
one
of
his
seemingly
gross
but
really
innocent
diversions
was
occasionally
visiting
a
certain
black
house
of
prostitution
of
which
there
were
many
in
louis
here
while
he
played
a
flute
and
some
one
else
a
tambourine
or
small
drum
he
would
have
two
or
three
of
the
inmates
dance
in
some
weird
savage
way
that
took
one
instanter
to
the
wilds
of
central
africa
there
was
so
far
as
i
know
no
payment
of
any
kind
made
in
connection
with
this
he
was
a
friend
in
some
crude
artistic
or
barbaric
way
he
satisfied
i
am
positive
some
love
of
color
sound
and
the
dance
in
these
queer
revels
nor
do
i
know
how
he
achieved
these
friendships
such
as
they
were
i
was
never
with
him
when
he
did
but
aside
from
the
satiation
they
afforded
his
taste
for
the
strange
and
picturesque
i
am
sure
they
reflected
no
gross
or
sensual
appetite
but
i
wish
to
attest
in
passing
that
the
mere
witnessing
of
these
free
scenes
had
a
tonic
as
well
as
toxic
effect
on
me
as
i
view
myself
now
i
was
a
poor
spindling
prying
fish
anxious
to
know
life
and
yet
because
of
my
very
narrow
training
very
fearsome
of
it
of
what
it
might
do
to
me
what
dreadful
contagion
of
thought
or
deed
it
might
open
me
to
peter
was
not
so
to
him
all
positively
life
was
good
it
was
a
fascinating
spectacle
to
be
studied
or
observed
and
rejoiced
in
as
a
spectacle
when
i
look
back
now
on
the
shabby
room
to
which
he
led
me
for
fun
the
absolutely
black
or
brown
girls
with
their
white
teeth
and
shiny
eyes
the
unexplainable
unintelligible
love
of
rhythm
and
the
dance
displayed
the
beating
of
a
drum
the
sinuous
winding
motions
of
the
body
i
am
grateful
to
him
he
released
my
mind
broadened
my
view
lengthened
my
perspective
for
as
i
sat
with
him
watching
him
beat
his
drum
or
play
his
flute
noted
the
gayety
his
love
of
color
and
effect
and
feeling
myself
a
criminal
disgraced
the
while
i
was
staring
with
all
my
sight
and
enjoying
it
intensely
i
realized
that
i
was
dealing
with
a
man
who
was
bigger
than
i
was
in
many
respects
saner
really
more
wholesome
i
was
a
moral
coward
and
he
was
not
losing
his
life
and
desires
through
fear
which
the
majority
of
us
do
he
was
strong
vital
unafraid
and
he
made
me
so
but
lest
i
seem
to
make
him
low
or
impossible
to
those
who
instinctively
can
not
accept
life
beyond
the
range
of
their
own
little
routine
world
let
me
hasten
to
his
other
aspects
he
was
not
low
but
simple
brilliant
and
varied
in
his
tastes
america
and
its
point
of
view
religious
and
otherwise
was
simply
amusing
to
him
not
to
be
taken
seriously
he
loved
to
contemplate
man
at
his
mysteries
rituals
secret
schools
he
loved
better
yet
ancient
history
medieval
inanities
and
atrocities
a
most
singular
curious
and
wonderful
mind
already
at
this
age
he
knew
many
historians
and
scientists
their
work
a
most
astonishing
and
illuminating
list
to
me
maspero
froude
huxley
darwin
wallace
rawlinson
froissart
hallam
taine
avebury
the
list
of
painters
sculptors
and
architects
with
whose
work
he
was
familiar
and
books
about
whom
or
illustrated
by
whom
he
knew
is
too
long
to
be
given
here
his
chief
interest
in
so
far
as
i
could
make
out
in
these
opening
days
was
egyptology
and
the
study
of
things
natural
and
primeval
all
the
wonders
of
a
natural
groping
savage
world
dreiser
he
exclaimed
once
with
gusto
his
bright
beady
eyes
gleaming
with
an
immense
human
warmth
you
have
the
slightest
idea
of
the
fascination
of
some
of
the
old
beliefs
do
you
know
the
significance
of
a
scarab
in
egyptian
religious
worship
for
instance
a
scarab
what
a
scarab
i
never
heard
of
one
i
answered
a
beetle
of
course
an
egyptian
beetle
you
know
what
a
beetle
is
do
you
well
those
things
burrowed
in
the
earth
the
mud
of
the
nile
at
a
certain
period
of
their
season
to
lay
their
eggs
and
the
next
spring
or
whenever
it
was
the
eggs
would
hatch
and
the
beetles
would
come
up
then
the
egyptians
imagined
that
the
beetle
had
died
at
all
or
if
it
had
that
it
also
had
the
power
of
restoring
itself
to
life
possessed
immortality
so
they
thought
it
must
be
a
god
and
began
to
worship
it
and
he
would
pause
and
survey
me
with
those
amazing
eyes
bright
as
glass
beads
to
see
if
i
were
properly
impressed
you
do
say
sure
that
where
the
worship
came
from
and
then
he
might
go
on
and
add
a
bit
about
the
zoroastrians
and
the
parsees
the
sacred
bull
of
egypt
its
sex
power
as
a
reason
for
its
religious
elevation
and
of
sex
worship
in
general
the
fantastic
orgies
at
sidon
and
tyre
where
enormous
images
of
the
male
and
female
sex
organs
were
carried
aloft
before
the
multitude
being
totally
ignorant
of
these
matters
at
the
time
not
a
rumor
of
them
having
reached
me
as
yet
in
my
meagre
reading
i
knew
that
it
must
be
so
it
fired
me
with
a
keen
desire
to
read
not
the
old
orthodox
emasculated
histories
of
the
schools
but
those
other
books
and
pamphlets
to
which
i
fancied
he
must
have
access
eagerly
i
inquired
of
him
where
how
he
told
me
that
in
some
cases
they
were
outlawed
banned
or
not
translated
wholly
or
fully
owing
to
the
puritanism
and
religiosity
of
the
day
but
he
gave
me
titles
and
authors
to
whom
i
might
have
access
and
the
address
of
an
old
or
two
who
could
get
them
for
me
in
addition
he
was
interested
in
ethnology
and
geology
as
well
as
astronomy
the
outstanding
phases
at
least
and
many
many
phases
of
applied
art
pottery
rugs
pictures
engraving
and
designing
and
i
know
not
what
else
yet
there
was
always
room
even
in
his
most
serious
studies
for
humor
of
the
bizarre
and
eccentric
type
amounting
to
all
but
an
obsession
he
wanted
to
laugh
and
he
found
occasion
for
doing
so
under
the
most
serious
or
at
least
circumstances
thus
i
recall
that
one
of
the
butts
of
his
extreme
humor
was
this
same
dick
whom
he
studied
with
the
greatest
care
for
points
worthy
his
humorous
appreciation
dick
in
addition
to
his
genuinely
lively
mental
interests
was
a
most
romantic
person
on
one
side
a
most
puling
and
complaining
soul
on
the
other
as
a
newspaper
artist
i
believe
he
was
only
a
fairly
respectable
craftsman
if
so
much
whereas
peter
was
much
better
although
he
deferred
to
dick
in
the
most
persuasive
manner
and
seemed
to
believe
at
times
though
i
knew
he
did
not
that
dick
represented
all
there
was
to
know
in
matters
artistic
among
other
things
at
this
time
the
latter
was
or
pretended
to
be
immensely
interested
in
all
things
pertaining
to
the
chinese
and
to
know
not
only
something
of
their
language
which
he
had
studied
a
little
somewhere
but
also
their
history
a
vague
matter
as
we
all
know
and
the
spirit
and
significance
of
their
art
and
customs
he
sometimes
condescended
to
take
us
about
with
him
to
one
or
two
chinese
restaurants
of
the
most
beggarly
description
and
as
he
wished
to
believe
because
of
the
romantic
titillation
involved
the
of
crooks
and
thieves
and
disreputable
tenderloin
characters
generally
of
such
was
the
beginning
of
the
chinese
restaurant
in
america
he
would
introduce
us
to
a
few
of
his
celestial
friends
whose
acquaintance
apparently
he
had
been
most
assiduously
cultivating
for
some
time
past
and
with
whom
he
was
now
on
the
best
of
terms
he
had
as
peter
pointed
out
to
me
the
happy
knack
of
persuading
himself
that
there
was
something
vastly
mysterious
and
superior
about
the
whole
chinese
race
that
there
was
some
chinese
organization
known
as
the
six
companions
which
so
far
as
i
could
make
out
from
him
was
ruling
very
nearly
and
secretly
of
course
the
entire
habitable
globe
for
one
thing
it
had
some
governing
connection
with
great
constructive
ventures
of
one
kind
and
another
in
all
parts
of
the
world
supplying
as
he
said
thousands
of
chinese
laborers
to
any
one
who
desired
them
anywhere
and
although
they
were
employed
by
others
ruling
them
with
a
rod
of
iron
cutting
their
throats
when
they
failed
to
perform
their
bounden
duties
and
burying
them
head
down
in
a
basket
of
rice
then
transferring
their
remains
quietly
to
china
in
coffins
made
in
china
and
brought
for
that
purpose
to
the
country
in
which
they
were
the
chinese
who
had
worked
for
the
builders
of
the
union
pacific
had
been
supplied
by
this
company
as
i
understood
from
dick
in
regard
to
all
this
peter
used
to
analyze
and
dispose
of
dick
romance
with
the
greatest
gusto
laughing
the
while
and
yet
pretending
to
accept
it
all
but
there
was
one
phase
of
all
this
which
interested
peter
immensely
were
there
on
sale
in
louis
any
bits
of
jade
silks
needlework
porcelains
basketry
or
figurines
of
true
chinese
origin
he
was
far
more
interested
in
this
than
in
the
social
and
economic
sides
of
the
lives
of
the
chinese
and
was
constantly
urging
dick
to
take
him
here
there
and
everywhere
in
order
that
he
might
see
for
himself
what
of
these
amazing
wonders
were
locally
extant
leading
dick
in
the
process
a
merry
chase
and
a
dog
life
dick
was
compelled
to
persuade
nearly
all
of
his
boasted
friends
to
produce
all
they
had
to
show
once
i
recall
a
collection
of
rare
chinese
porcelains
being
shown
at
the
local
museum
of
art
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
that
dick
must
get
one
or
more
of
his
oriental
friends
to
interpret
this
that
and
the
other
symbol
in
connection
with
this
that
and
the
other
vase
things
which
put
him
to
no
end
of
trouble
and
which
led
to
nothing
for
among
all
the
local
chinese
there
was
not
one
who
knew
anything
about
it
although
they
dick
included
were
not
honest
enough
to
admit
it
you
know
dreiser
peter
said
to
me
one
day
with
the
most
delicious
gleam
of
humor
i
am
really
doing
all
this
just
to
torture
dick
he
does
know
a
damned
thing
about
it
and
neither
do
these
chinese
but
it
fun
to
haul
out
there
and
make
sweat
the
museum
sells
an
illustrated
monograph
covering
all
this
you
know
with
pictures
of
the
genuinely
historic
pieces
and
explanations
of
the
various
symbols
in
so
far
as
they
are
known
but
dick
does
know
that
and
he
lying
awake
nights
trying
to
find
out
what
they
all
about
i
like
to
see
his
expression
and
that
of
those
chinks
when
they
examine
those
things
he
subsided
with
a
low
chuckle
all
the
more
disturbing
because
it
was
so
obviously
the
product
of
knowledge
another
phase
of
this
same
humor
related
to
the
grand
artistic
social
and
other
forms
of
life
to
which
dick
was
hoping
to
ascend
via
marriage
and
which
led
him
because
of
a
kind
of
anticipatory
eagerness
into
all
sorts
of
exaggerations
of
dress
manners
speech
style
in
writing
or
drawing
and
i
know
not
what
else
he
had
as
i
have
said
a
studio
in
broadway
an
ordinary
large
square
upper
chamber
of
an
old
residence
turned
commercial
but
which
dick
had
decorated
in
the
most
to
him
recherché
or
manner
possible
in
dick
gilding
imagination
it
was
packed
with
the
rarest
and
most
carefully
selected
things
odd
bits
of
furniture
objects
of
art
pictures
books
things
which
the
ordinary
antique
shop
provides
in
plenty
but
which
to
dick
having
been
reared
in
bloomington
illinois
were
of
the
utmost
artistic
import
he
had
vaulting
ambitions
and
pretensions
literary
and
otherwise
having
by
now
composed
various
rondeaus
triolets
quatrains
sonnets
in
addition
to
a
number
of
short
stories
over
which
he
had
literally
slaved
and
which
being
rejected
by
many
editors
were
kept
lying
idly
and
inconsequentially
and
seemingly
inconspicuously
about
his
place
the
more
to
astonish
the
poor
unsophisticated
outsider
besides
it
gave
him
the
opportunity
of
posing
as
misunderstood
neglected
depressed
as
becomes
all
great
artists
poets
and
thinkers
his
great
scheme
or
dream
however
was
that
of
marriage
to
an
heiress
one
of
those
very
material
and
bovine
daughters
of
the
new
rich
in
the
west
end
and
to
this
end
he
was
bending
all
his
artistic
thought
writing
dressing
dreaming
the
thing
he
wished
i
myself
had
a
marked
tendency
in
this
direction
although
from
another
point
of
view
and
speaking
from
mine
purely
there
was
this
difference
between
us
dick
being
an
artist
rather
remote
and
disdainful
in
manner
and
decidedly
handsome
as
well
as
poetic
and
better
positioned
than
i
as
i
fancied
was
certain
to
achieve
this
gilded
and
crystal
state
whereas
i
not
being
handsome
nor
an
artist
nor
sufficiently
poetic
perhaps
could
scarcely
aspire
to
so
gorgeous
a
goal
often
as
around
dinnertime
he
ambled
from
the
office
arrayed
in
the
latest
mode
dark
blue
suit
patent
leather
boots
a
dark
round
soft
felt
hat
loose
tie
blowing
idly
about
his
neck
a
thin
cane
in
his
hand
i
was
already
almost
convinced
that
the
anticipated
end
was
at
hand
this
very
evening
perhaps
and
that
i
should
never
see
him
more
except
as
the
husband
of
a
very
rich
girl
never
be
permitted
even
to
speak
to
him
save
as
an
almost
forgotten
friend
and
in
passing
even
now
perhaps
he
was
on
his
way
to
her
whereas
i
poor
oaf
that
i
was
was
moiling
here
over
some
trucky
work
would
my
ship
never
come
in
my
great
day
never
arrive
my
turn
unkind
heaven
as
for
peter
he
was
the
sort
of
person
who
could
swiftly
detect
understand
and
even
sympathize
with
a
point
of
view
of
this
kind
the
while
he
must
laugh
at
it
and
his
mind
be
busy
with
some
plan
of
making
a
use
of
it
one
day
he
came
into
the
where
i
was
working
and
bending
over
my
desk
fairly
bursting
with
suppressed
humor
announced
gee
dreiser
i
just
thought
of
a
delicious
trick
to
play
on
dick
oh
lord
and
he
stopped
and
surveyed
me
with
beady
eyes
the
while
his
round
little
body
seemed
to
fairly
swell
with
laughter
it
too
rich
oh
if
it
just
works
out
dick
be
sore
wait
i
tell
you
he
went
on
you
know
how
crazy
he
is
about
rich
young
heiresses
you
know
how
he
always
up
and
talking
and
writing
about
marrying
one
of
those
girls
in
the
west
end
dick
was
forever
composing
a
short
story
in
which
some
lorn
but
perfect
and
great
artist
was
thus
being
received
via
love
the
story
being
read
to
us
nights
in
his
studio
that
all
bluff
that
talk
of
his
of
visiting
in
those
big
houses
out
there
all
he
does
is
to
dress
up
every
night
as
though
he
were
going
to
a
ball
and
walk
out
that
way
and
moon
around
well
listen
here
the
idea
we
go
over
to
mermod
jaccards
and
get
a
few
sheets
of
their
best
monogrammed
paper
sample
sheets
then
we
get
up
a
letter
and
sign
it
with
the
most
romantic
name
we
can
think
of
juanita
or
cyrene
or
doris
and
explain
who
she
is
the
daughter
of
a
millionaire
living
out
there
and
that
she
been
strictly
brought
up
but
that
in
spite
of
all
that
she
seen
his
name
in
the
paper
at
the
bottom
of
his
pictures
and
wants
to
meet
him
see
then
we
have
her
suggest
that
he
come
out
to
the
west
gate
of
say
portland
place
at
seven
and
meet
her
we
have
her
describe
herself
see
young
and
beautiful
and
some
attractive
costume
she
to
wear
and
we
kill
him
he
fall
hard
then
we
happen
by
there
at
the
exact
time
when
he
waiting
and
detain
him
urge
him
to
come
into
the
park
with
us
or
to
dinner
we
look
our
worst
so
he
be
ashamed
of
us
he
squirm
and
get
wild
but
we
hang
on
and
spoil
the
date
for
him
see
we
insist
in
the
letter
that
he
must
be
alone
see
because
she
timid
and
afraid
of
being
recognized
my
god
he
be
crazy
he
think
we
ruined
his
life
oh
ho
ho
and
he
fairly
writhed
with
inward
joy
the
thing
worked
it
was
cruel
in
its
way
but
when
has
man
ever
grieved
over
the
humorous
ills
of
others
the
paper
was
secured
the
letter
written
by
a
friend
of
peter
in
a
nearby
real
estate
office
after
the
most
careful
deliberation
as
to
wording
on
our
part
extreme
youth
beauty
and
a
great
mansion
were
all
hinted
at
the
fascination
of
dick
as
a
romantic
figure
was
touched
upon
he
would
know
her
by
a
green
silk
scarf
about
her
waist
for
it
was
spring
the
ideal
season
seven
was
the
hour
she
could
give
him
only
a
moment
or
two
then
but
later
and
she
gave
no
address
the
letter
was
mailed
in
the
west
end
as
was
meet
and
proper
and
in
due
season
arrived
at
the
office
peter
working
at
the
next
easel
observed
him
as
he
told
me
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
you
should
have
seen
him
dreiser
he
exclaimed
hunting
me
up
about
an
hour
after
the
letter
arrived
oh
ho
say
you
know
i
believe
he
thinks
it
the
real
thing
it
seemed
to
make
him
a
little
sick
he
tried
to
appear
nonchalant
but
a
little
later
he
got
his
hat
and
went
out
over
to
deck
a
nearby
saloon
for
a
drink
for
i
followed
him
he
all
fussed
up
wait
we
heave
into
view
that
night
i
going
to
get
myself
up
like
a
joke
a
hobo
i
disgrace
him
oh
lord
he
be
crazy
he
think
we
ruined
his
life
scared
her
off
there
no
address
he
ca
do
a
thing
oh
ho
ho
ho
on
the
appointed
day
and
it
was
a
delicious
afternoon
and
evening
aflame
with
sun
and
in
may
dick
left
off
his
work
at
three
as
peter
came
and
told
me
and
departed
and
then
we
went
to
make
our
toilets
at
six
we
met
took
a
car
and
stepped
down
not
more
than
a
short
block
from
the
point
of
meeting
i
shall
never
forget
the
sweetness
of
the
air
the
something
of
sadness
in
the
thought
of
love
even
in
this
form
the
sun
was
singing
its
evensong
as
were
the
birds
but
peter
blessings
or
curses
upon
him
was
arrayed
as
only
he
could
array
himself
when
he
wished
to
look
absolutely
disconcerting
more
like
an
unwashed
uncombed
tramp
who
had
been
sleeping
out
for
weeks
than
anything
else
his
hair
was
over
his
eyes
and
ears
his
face
and
hands
dirty
his
shoes
ditto
he
had
even
blackened
one
tooth
slightly
he
had
on
a
collarless
shirt
and
yet
he
was
jaunty
withal
and
carried
a
cane
if
you
please
assuming
as
he
always
could
and
in
the
most
aggravating
way
to
be
totally
unconscious
of
the
figure
he
cut
at
one
angle
of
his
multiplex
character
the
man
must
have
been
a
born
actor
we
waited
a
block
away
concealed
by
a
few
trees
and
at
the
exact
hour
dick
appeared
hopeful
and
eager
no
doubt
and
walking
and
looking
almost
all
that
he
hoped
delicate
pale
artistic
the
new
straw
hat
the
pale
green
artists
shirt
his
black
belt
the
cane
the
low
shoes
the
boutonnière
he
was
plainly
ready
for
any
fate
his
great
moment
and
then
before
he
could
get
the
feeling
that
his
admirer
might
not
be
coming
we
descended
upon
him
in
all
our
wretched
nonchalance
and
unworthiness
out
of
hell
as
it
were
we
were
most
brisk
familiar
affectionate
it
was
so
fortunate
to
meet
him
so
so
accidentally
and
peradventure
the
night
was
so
fine
we
were
out
for
a
stroll
in
the
park
to
eat
afterward
he
must
come
along
i
saw
him
look
at
peter
in
that
hat
and
no
collar
and
wilt
it
was
too
much
such
a
friend
such
friends
for
on
peter
advice
i
was
looking
as
ill
as
i
might
an
easy
matter
no
he
could
come
he
was
waiting
for
some
friends
we
must
excuse
him
but
peter
was
not
to
be
so
easily
shaken
off
he
launched
into
the
most
brisk
and
serious
conversation
he
began
his
badger
game
by
asking
about
some
work
upon
which
dick
had
been
engaged
before
he
left
the
office
some
order
how
he
was
getting
along
with
it
when
it
would
be
done
and
when
dick
evaded
and
then
attempted
to
dismiss
the
subject
took
up
another
and
began
to
expatiate
on
it
some
work
he
himself
was
doing
something
that
had
developed
in
connection
with
it
he
asked
inane
questions
complimented
dick
on
his
looks
began
to
tease
him
about
some
girl
and
poor
dick
his
nervousness
his
despair
almost
the
sense
of
the
waning
of
his
opportunity
it
was
cruel
he
was
becoming
more
and
more
restless
looking
about
more
and
more
wearily
and
anxiously
and
wishing
to
go
or
for
us
to
go
he
was
horribly
unhappy
finally
after
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
had
gone
and
various
girls
had
crossed
the
plaza
in
various
directions
as
well
as
carriages
and
each
one
carrying
his
heiress
no
doubt
he
seemed
to
summon
all
his
courage
and
did
his
best
to
dispose
of
us
you
two
have
to
excuse
me
he
exclaimed
almost
wildly
i
ca
wait
those
golden
moments
she
could
not
approach
my
people
are
coming
i
guess
i
have
to
be
going
on
he
smiled
weakly
and
made
off
peter
half
following
and
urging
him
to
come
back
then
since
he
would
not
we
stood
there
on
the
exact
spot
of
the
rendezvous
gazing
smirkily
after
him
then
we
went
into
the
park
a
few
paces
and
sat
on
a
bench
in
full
view
talking
or
peter
was
most
volubly
he
was
really
choking
with
laughter
a
little
later
at
we
went
cackling
into
the
park
only
to
return
in
five
minutes
as
though
we
had
changed
our
minds
and
were
coming
out
and
saw
dick
bustling
off
at
our
approach
it
was
sad
really
there
was
an
element
of
the
tragic
in
it
but
not
to
peter
he
was
all
laughter
all
but
apoplectic
gayety
oh
by
george
he
choked
this
is
too
much
oh
ho
this
is
great
his
poor
heiress
and
he
came
back
har
har
har
peter
you
dog
i
said
are
you
ashamed
of
yourself
to
rub
it
in
this
way
not
a
bit
not
a
bit
he
insisted
most
enthusiastically
do
him
good
why
should
he
suffer
he
get
over
it
he
always
bluffing
about
his
heiresses
now
he
lost
a
real
one
har
har
har
and
he
fairly
choked
and
for
days
and
weeks
and
months
he
laughed
but
he
never
told
he
merely
chortled
at
his
desk
and
if
any
one
asked
him
what
he
was
laughing
about
even
dick
he
would
reply
oh
something
a
joke
i
played
on
a
fellow
once
if
dick
ever
guessed
he
never
indicated
as
much
but
that
lost
romance
that
faded
dream
not
so
long
after
this
the
following
winter
i
left
louis
and
did
not
see
peter
for
several
years
during
which
time
i
drifted
through
various
cities
to
new
york
we
kept
up
a
more
or
less
desultory
correspondence
which
resulted
eventually
in
his
contributing
to
a
paper
of
which
i
had
charge
in
new
york
and
later
in
part
at
least
i
am
sure
in
his
coming
there
i
noticed
one
thing
that
although
peter
had
no
fixed
idea
as
to
what
he
wished
to
be
being
able
to
draw
write
engrave
carve
and
what
not
he
was
in
no
way
troubled
about
it
i
do
see
just
what
it
is
that
i
am
to
do
best
he
said
to
me
once
it
may
be
that
i
will
wind
up
as
a
painter
or
writer
or
collector
i
tell
yet
i
want
to
study
and
meantime
i
making
a
living
that
all
i
want
now
i
want
to
live
and
i
am
living
in
my
way
some
men
are
masters
of
cities
or
perhaps
better
of
all
the
elements
which
enter
into
the
making
of
them
and
peter
was
one
i
think
sometimes
that
he
was
born
a
writer
of
great
force
and
charm
only
as
yet
he
had
not
found
himself
i
have
known
many
writers
many
geniuses
even
but
not
one
his
superior
in
intellect
and
romantic
response
to
life
he
was
a
poet
thinker
artist
philosopher
and
master
of
prose
as
a
posthumous
volume
wolf
the
autobiography
of
a
cave
dweller
amply
proves
but
he
was
not
ready
then
to
fully
express
himself
and
it
troubled
him
not
at
all
he
loved
life
every
facet
was
gay
and
helpful
to
himself
and
others
and
yet
always
with
an
eye
for
the
undercurrent
of
human
misery
error
and
tragedy
as
well
as
comedy
immediately
upon
coming
to
new
york
he
began
to
examine
and
grasp
it
in
a
large
way
its
museums
public
buildings
geography
politics
but
after
a
very
little
while
decided
suddenly
that
he
did
not
belong
there
and
without
a
although
once
more
we
had
fallen
into
each
other
ways
he
departed
without
a
word
and
i
did
not
hear
from
him
for
months
temporarily
at
least
he
felt
that
he
had
to
obtain
more
experience
in
a
lesser
field
and
lost
no
time
in
so
doing
the
next
i
knew
he
was
connected
at
a
comfortable
salary
with
the
then
dominant
paper
of
philadelphia
it
was
after
he
had
established
himself
very
firmly
in
philadelphia
that
we
two
finally
began
to
understand
each
other
fully
to
sympathize
really
with
each
other
point
of
view
as
opposed
to
the
more
or
less
gay
and
casual
nature
of
our
earlier
friendship
also
here
perhaps
more
than
before
we
felt
the
binding
influence
of
having
worked
together
in
the
west
it
was
here
that
i
first
noticed
the
ease
with
which
he
took
hold
of
a
city
the
of
his
peculiar
character
which
led
him
to
reflect
so
many
angles
of
it
which
a
less
varied
temperament
would
never
have
touched
upon
for
first
of
all
wherever
he
happened
to
be
he
was
intensely
interested
in
the
age
and
history
of
his
city
its
buildings
and
graveyards
and
tombstones
which
pointed
to
its
past
life
then
its
present
physical
appearance
the
chief
characteristics
of
the
region
in
which
it
lay
its
rivers
lakes
parks
and
adjacent
places
and
spots
of
interest
what
rambles
we
took
as
well
as
its
newest
and
finest
things
architecturally
nor
did
any
one
ever
take
a
keener
interest
in
the
current
intellectual
resources
of
a
city
any
city
in
which
he
happened
to
be
its
museums
libraries
old
bookstores
newspapers
magazines
and
i
know
not
what
else
it
was
he
who
first
took
me
into
leary
bookstore
in
philadelphia
descanting
with
his
usual
gusto
on
its
merits
then
and
lastly
he
was
keenly
and
wisely
interested
in
various
currents
of
local
politics
society
and
finance
although
he
always
considered
the
first
a
low
mess
an
arrangement
or
adjustment
of
many
necessary
things
among
the
lower
orders
he
seemed
to
know
or
sense
in
some
occult
way
everything
that
was
going
on
in
those
various
realms
his
mind
was
so
full
and
rich
that
merely
to
be
with
him
was
a
delight
he
gushed
like
a
fountain
and
yet
not
polemically
of
all
he
knew
heard
felt
suspected
his
thoughts
were
so
rich
at
times
that
to
me
they
were
more
like
a
mosaic
of
variegated
and
richly
colored
stones
and
jewels
i
felt
always
as
though
i
were
in
the
presence
of
a
great
personage
not
one
who
was
reserved
or
pompous
but
a
loose
bubbling
temperament
wise
beyond
his
years
or
day
and
so
truly
great
that
perhaps
because
of
the
intensity
and
immense
variety
of
his
interests
he
would
never
shine
in
a
world
in
which
the
most
intensive
specialization
and
that
of
a
purely
commercial
character
was
the
grand
rôle
and
yet
i
always
felt
that
perhaps
he
might
he
attracted
people
of
all
grades
so
easily
and
warmly
his
mind
leaped
from
one
interest
to
another
almost
too
swiftly
and
yet
the
average
man
understood
and
liked
him
while
in
a
way
he
contemned
their
mental
states
as
limited
or
bigoted
he
enjoyed
the
conditions
under
which
they
lived
seemed
to
wish
to
immerse
himself
in
them
and
yet
nearly
all
his
thoughts
were
from
their
point
of
view
perhaps
dangerous
among
his
friends
he
was
always
talking
freely
honestly
of
things
which
the
average
man
could
not
or
would
not
discuss
dismissing
as
trash
illusion
lies
or
the
cunning
work
of
propagandists
most
of
the
things
currently
accepted
as
true
he
was
constantly
commenting
on
the
amazing
dullness
of
man
his
prejudices
the
astonishing
manner
in
which
he
seized
upon
and
clung
savagely
or
pathetically
to
the
most
ridiculous
interpretations
of
life
he
was
also
forever
noting
that
crass
chance
which
wrecks
so
many
of
our
dreams
and
lives
its
fierce
brutalities
its
seemingly
inane
indifference
to
wondrous
things
but
never
in
a
depressed
or
morbid
spirit
merely
as
a
matter
of
the
curious
as
it
were
but
if
any
one
chanced
to
contradict
him
he
was
likely
to
prove
liquid
fire
at
the
same
time
he
was
forever
reading
reading
reading
history
archæology
ethnology
geology
travel
medicine
biography
and
descanting
on
the
wonders
and
idiosyncrasies
of
man
and
nature
which
they
revealed
he
was
never
tired
of
talking
of
the
intellectual
and
social
conditions
that
ruled
in
greece
and
rome
from
on
the
philosophies
the
travels
the
art
the
simple
natural
pagan
view
of
things
and
regretting
that
they
were
no
more
he
grieved
at
times
i
think
that
he
had
not
been
of
that
world
might
not
have
seen
it
or
failing
that
might
not
see
all
the
shards
of
those
extinct
civilizations
there
was
something
loving
and
sad
in
the
manner
in
which
at
times
in
one
museum
and
another
he
would
examine
ancient
art
designs
those
of
the
egyptians
greeks
and
romans
their
public
and
private
house
plans
their
statues
book
rolls
inscriptions
flambeaux
boats
swords
chariots
carthage
rome
greece
phoenicia
their
colonies
art
and
trade
stuffs
their
foods
pleasures
and
worships
how
he
raved
a
book
like
thaïs
salammbo
sonica
quo
vadis
touched
him
to
the
quick
at
the
same
time
and
odd
as
it
may
seem
he
was
seemingly
in
intimate
contact
with
a
circle
of
friends
that
rather
astonished
me
by
its
catholicity
it
included
for
instance
and
quite
naïvely
real
estate
dealers
clerks
a
bank
cashier
or
two
some
man
who
had
a
leather
shop
or
cigar
factory
in
the
downtown
section
a
drummer
a
printer
two
or
three
newspaper
artists
and
reporters
a
list
too
long
to
catalogue
here
and
seemingly
not
interesting
at
least
not
inspiring
to
look
at
or
live
in
contact
with
yet
his
relations
with
all
of
these
were
of
a
warm
genial
helpful
homely
character
quite
intimate
he
used
them
as
one
might
a
mulch
in
which
to
grow
things
or
in
other
words
he
took
them
on
their
own
ground
a
thing
which
i
could
never
quite
understand
being
more
or
less
aloof
myself
and
yet
wishing
always
to
be
able
so
to
do
to
take
life
as
he
did
for
he
desired
and
secured
their
good
will
and
drew
them
to
him
he
took
a
simple
natural
pleasure
in
the
kinds
of
things
they
were
able
to
do
as
well
as
the
kinds
of
things
he
could
do
with
these
then
and
a
type
of
girl
who
might
not
be
classed
above
the
clerk
or
manicure
class
he
and
they
managed
to
eke
out
a
social
life
the
outstanding
phases
of
which
were
dances
parties
dinners
at
one
simple
home
and
another
flirting
boating
and
fishing
expeditions
in
season
evenings
out
at
restaurants
or
the
theater
and
i
know
not
what
else
he
could
sing
a
very
fair
baritone
play
the
piano
cornet
flute
banjo
mandolin
and
guitar
but
always
insisted
that
his
favorite
instruments
were
the
the
french
harp
mouth
organ
and
a
comb
with
a
piece
of
paper
over
it
against
which
he
would
blow
with
fierce
energy
making
the
most
outrageous
sounds
until
stopped
at
any
party
he
was
always
talking
jumping
about
dancing
cooking
something
fudge
taffy
a
rarebit
and
insisting
in
the
most
manner
that
all
the
details
be
left
strictly
to
him
now
just
cut
out
of
this
all
of
you
and
leave
this
to
your
uncle
dudley
who
doing
this
all
i
want
is
sugar
chocolate
a
pot
a
big
spoon
and
i
show
you
the
best
fudge
you
ever
ate
then
he
would
don
an
apron
or
towel
and
go
to
work
in
a
manner
which
would
rob
any
gathering
of
a
sense
of
stiffness
and
induce
a
naturalness
most
intriguing
calculated
to
enhance
the
general
pleasure
an
hundredfold
yes
peter
woke
people
up
he
could
convey
or
spread
a
sense
of
ease
and
good
nature
and
give
and
take
among
all
wise
as
he
was
and
not
so
he
was
still
attractive
to
girls
very
much
so
and
by
no
means
unconscious
of
their
beauty
he
could
always
and
easily
break
down
their
reserve
and
was
soon
apparently
on
terms
of
absolute
friendship
exchanging
all
sorts
of
small
gossip
and
news
with
them
about
this
that
and
the
other
person
about
whom
they
knew
indeed
he
was
such
a
general
favorite
and
so
seemingly
impartial
that
it
was
hard
to
say
how
he
came
close
to
any
and
yet
he
did
at
odd
moments
he
was
always
making
confessions
as
to
nights
or
afternoons
my
god
dreiser
i
found
a
peach
i
ca
tell
you
but
oh
wonderful
just
what
i
need
this
world
a
healthy
old
place
eh
have
another
drink
what
and
he
would
order
a
stein
or
a
of
light
german
beer
and
pour
it
down
grinning
like
a
gargoyle
it
was
while
he
was
in
philadelphia
that
he
told
me
the
beginnings
of
the
love
affair
which
eventually
ended
in
his
marrying
and
settling
down
into
the
homiest
of
home
men
i
have
ever
seen
and
which
for
sheer
naïveté
and
charm
is
one
of
the
best
love
stories
i
know
anything
about
it
appears
that
he
was
walking
in
some
factory
realm
of
north
philadelphia
one
saturday
afternoon
about
the
first
or
second
year
of
his
stay
there
when
playing
in
the
street
with
some
other
children
he
saw
a
girl
of
not
more
than
thirteen
or
fourteen
who
as
he
expressed
it
to
me
came
damned
near
being
the
prettiest
thing
i
ever
saw
she
had
yellow
hair
and
a
short
blue
dress
and
pink
bows
in
her
hair
and
say
dreiser
when
i
saw
her
i
stopped
flat
and
said
for
that
if
i
have
to
wait
fifteen
years
dutchy
you
never
saw
the
beat
and
poor
her
shoes
were
clogs
she
could
even
talk
english
yet
neither
could
the
other
kids
they
were
all
sausage
a
regular
german
neighborhood
but
say
i
watched
her
a
while
and
then
i
went
over
and
said
here
kid
where
do
you
live
she
did
understand
and
one
of
the
other
kids
translated
for
her
and
then
she
said
sprech
nicht
english
and
he
mocked
her
that
fixed
her
for
me
one
of
the
others
finally
told
me
who
she
was
and
where
she
lived
and
say
i
went
right
home
and
began
studying
german
in
three
months
i
could
make
myself
understood
but
before
that
in
two
weeks
i
hunted
up
her
old
man
and
made
him
understand
that
i
wanted
to
be
friends
with
the
family
to
learn
german
i
went
out
sundays
when
they
were
all
at
home
there
are
six
children
and
i
made
friends
with
all
for
a
long
time
i
make
madchen
that
what
they
call
her
understand
what
it
was
all
about
but
finally
i
did
and
she
knows
now
all
right
and
i
crazy
about
her
and
i
going
to
marry
her
as
soon
as
she
old
enough
how
do
you
know
that
she
have
you
i
inquired
oh
she
have
me
i
always
tell
her
i
going
to
marry
her
when
eighteen
and
she
says
all
right
and
i
really
believe
she
does
like
me
i
crazy
about
her
five
years
later
if
i
may
anticipate
a
bit
after
he
had
moved
to
newark
and
placed
himself
rather
well
in
the
journalistic
field
and
was
able
to
carry
out
his
plans
in
regard
to
himself
he
suddenly
returned
to
philadelphia
and
married
preparing
beforehand
an
apartment
which
he
fancied
would
please
her
it
was
a
fortunate
marriage
in
so
far
as
love
and
home
pleasures
were
concerned
i
never
encountered
a
more
delightful
atmosphere
all
along
in
writing
this
i
feel
as
though
i
were
giving
but
the
thinnest
portrait
of
peter
he
was
so
full
and
varied
in
his
moods
and
interests
to
me
he
illustrated
the
joy
that
exists
on
the
one
hand
in
the
common
the
homely
and
what
some
might
think
ugly
side
of
life
certainly
the
very
simple
and
ordinarily
human
aspect
of
things
on
the
other
in
the
sheer
comfort
and
satisfaction
that
might
be
taken
in
things
truly
intellectual
and
artistic
but
to
which
no
great
expense
attached
old
books
prints
things
connected
with
history
and
science
in
their
various
forms
skill
in
matters
relating
to
the
applied
arts
and
what
not
such
as
the
coloring
and
firing
of
pottery
and
glass
the
making
of
baskets
hammocks
and
rugs
the
carving
of
wood
the
collection
and
imitation
of
japanese
and
chinese
prints
the
art
of
embalming
as
applied
by
the
egyptians
which
in
connection
with
an
undertaker
to
whom
he
had
attached
himself
he
attempted
to
revive
or
at
least
play
with
testing
his
skill
for
instance
by
embalming
a
dead
cat
or
two
after
the
egyptian
manner
in
all
of
these
lines
he
trained
himself
after
a
fashion
and
worked
with
skill
although
invariably
he
insisted
that
he
was
little
more
than
a
bungler
a
poor
follower
after
the
art
of
some
one
else
but
most
of
all
at
this
time
and
later
he
was
interested
in
collecting
things
japanese
and
chinese
netsukes
inros
censors
images
of
jade
and
porcelain
teajars
vases
prints
and
it
was
while
he
was
in
philadelphia
and
seemingly
trifling
about
with
the
group
i
have
mentioned
and
making
love
to
his
little
german
girl
that
he
was
running
here
and
there
to
this
museum
and
that
and
laying
the
foundations
of
some
of
those
interesting
collections
which
later
he
was
fond
of
showing
his
friends
or
interested
collectors
by
the
time
he
had
reached
newark
as
chief
cartoonist
of
the
leading
paper
there
he
was
in
possession
of
a
complete
tokaido
the
forty
views
on
the
road
between
tokio
and
kyoto
various
prints
by
hokusai
sesshiu
sojo
a
collection
of
one
hundred
inros
all
of
fifty
netsukes
all
of
thirty
censers
lacquered
boxes
and
teajars
and
various
other
exceedingly
beautiful
and
valuable
things
mandarin
skirts
and
coats
among
other
things
which
subsequently
he
sold
or
traded
around
among
one
collector
friend
and
another
for
things
which
they
had
i
recall
his
selling
his
completed
tokaido
a
labor
which
had
extended
over
four
years
for
over
a
thousand
dollars
just
before
he
died
he
was
trading
netsukes
for
inros
and
getting
ready
to
sell
all
these
latter
to
a
man
who
in
turn
was
going
to
sell
his
collection
to
a
museum
but
in
between
was
this
other
this
side
which
ran
to
such
commonplaces
as
bowling
golf
billiards
cards
and
gambling
with
the
dice
a
thing
which
always
struck
me
as
having
an
odd
turn
to
it
in
connection
with
peter
since
he
could
be
interested
in
so
many
other
things
and
yet
he
pursued
these
commonplaces
with
as
much
gusto
at
times
as
one
possessed
of
a
mania
at
others
he
seemed
not
to
miss
or
think
of
them
indeed
you
could
be
sure
of
him
and
all
his
interests
whatever
they
were
feeling
that
he
had
himself
well
in
hand
knew
exactly
how
far
he
was
going
and
that
when
the
time
came
he
could
and
would
stop
yet
during
the
process
of
his
momentary
relaxation
or
satiation
in
whatever
field
it
might
be
he
would
give
you
a
sense
of
abandon
even
ungovernable
appetite
which
to
one
who
had
not
known
him
long
might
have
indicated
a
mania
thus
i
remember
once
running
over
to
philadelphia
to
spend
a
saturday
and
sunday
with
him
visits
of
this
kind
in
either
direction
being
of
the
commonest
occurrence
at
that
time
he
was
living
in
some
in
south
fourth
street
but
in
which
dwelt
or
visited
the
group
and
whenever
i
came
there
at
least
there
was
always
an
atmosphere
of
intense
gaming
or
playing
in
some
form
which
conveyed
to
me
nothing
so
much
as
a
glorious
sense
of
life
and
pleasure
a
dozen
or
more
men
might
be
seated
at
or
standing
about
a
poker
or
dice
table
in
summer
often
in
winter
with
their
coats
off
their
sleeves
rolled
up
peter
always
conspicuous
among
them
on
the
table
or
to
one
side
would
be
money
a
pitcher
or
a
tin
pail
of
beer
boxes
of
cigarettes
or
cigars
and
there
would
be
peter
among
the
players
flushed
with
excitement
his
collar
off
his
hair
awry
his
little
figure
stirring
about
here
and
there
or
gesticulating
or
lighting
a
cigar
or
pouring
down
a
glass
of
beer
shouting
at
the
top
of
his
voice
his
eyes
aglow
that
mine
i
say
it
not
two
on
the
sixes
three
four
ah
roll
the
bones
roll
the
bones
get
off
get
off
come
on
now
spikes
cough
up
you
got
the
money
now
pay
back
no
more
loans
if
you
do
once
on
the
fours
the
fives
the
aces
roll
the
bones
roll
the
bones
come
on
or
if
he
saw
me
softening
and
saying
gee
dreiser
i
ahead
so
far
or
i
lost
thirty
all
told
i
stick
this
out
though
to
win
or
lose
five
more
and
then
i
quit
i
give
notice
you
fellows
five
more
one
way
or
the
other
and
then
i
through
see
say
these
damned
sharks
are
always
trying
to
turn
a
trick
and
when
they
lose
they
want
to
pay
i
offa
this
for
life
unless
i
get
a
better
deal
in
the
room
there
might
be
three
or
four
girls
sisters
sweethearts
pals
of
one
or
other
of
the
players
some
dancing
some
playing
the
piano
or
singing
and
in
addition
the
landlord
and
his
wife
a
slattern
pair
usually
about
whose
past
and
present
lives
peter
seemed
always
to
know
much
he
had
seduced
them
all
apparently
into
a
kind
of
rakish
camaraderie
which
was
literally
amazing
to
behold
it
thrilled
fascinated
at
times
frightened
me
so
thin
and
inadequate
and
inefficient
seemed
my
own
point
of
view
and
appetite
for
life
he
was
vigorous
charitable
pagan
gay
full
of
health
and
strength
he
would
play
at
something
anything
indoors
or
out
as
occasion
offered
until
he
was
fairly
perspiring
when
throwing
down
whatever
implement
he
had
in
hand
be
it
cards
a
a
golf
club
would
declare
that
enough
that
enough
i
done
now
i
or
licked
no
more
not
another
round
come
on
dreiser
i
know
just
the
place
for
us
and
then
descanting
on
a
steak
or
fish
planked
or
some
new
method
of
serving
corn
or
sweet
potatoes
or
tomatoes
he
would
lead
the
way
somewhere
to
a
favorite
rat
killer
as
he
used
to
say
or
grill
or
chinese
den
and
order
enough
for
four
or
five
unless
stopped
as
he
walked
and
he
always
preferred
to
walk
the
latest
political
row
or
scandal
the
latest
discovery
tragedy
or
art
topic
would
get
his
keen
attention
in
his
presence
the
whole
world
used
to
look
different
to
me
more
colorful
more
hopeful
more
gay
doors
seemed
to
open
in
imagination
i
saw
the
interiors
of
a
thousand
realms
homes
factories
laboratories
dens
resorts
of
pleasure
during
his
day
such
figures
as
mckinley
roosevelt
hanna
rockefeller
rogers
morgan
peary
harriman
were
abroad
and
active
and
their
mental
states
and
points
of
view
and
interests
and
sincerities
and
insincerities
were
the
subject
of
his
wholly
brilliant
analysis
he
rather
admired
the
clever
opportunist
i
think
so
long
as
he
was
not
mean
in
view
or
petty
yet
he
scorned
and
even
despised
the
commercial
viewpoint
or
trade
reactions
of
a
man
like
mckinley
rulers
ought
to
be
above
mere
commercialism
once
when
i
asked
him
why
he
disliked
mckinley
so
much
he
replied
laconically
the
voice
is
the
voice
of
mckinley
but
the
hands
are
the
hands
of
hanna
roosevelt
seemed
to
amuse
him
always
to
be
a
delightful
if
ridiculous
and
grandstander
as
he
always
said
always
looking
out
for
teddy
you
bet
but
good
for
the
country
inspiring
it
with
visions
rockefeller
was
wholly
admirable
as
a
force
driving
the
country
on
to
autocracy
oligarchy
possibly
revolution
ditto
hanna
ditto
morgan
ditto
harriman
ditto
rogers
unless
checked
peary
might
have
and
again
might
not
have
discovered
the
north
pole
he
refused
to
judge
old
doc
cook
the
pseudo
discoverer
who
appeared
very
shortly
before
he
died
only
drew
forth
chuckles
of
delight
my
god
the
gall
the
nerve
and
that
wreath
of
roses
the
danes
put
around
his
neck
colossal
dreiser
it
grand
munchausen
cook
gulliver
marco
polo
they
live
forever
or
ought
to
some
saturday
afternoons
or
sundays
if
he
came
to
me
or
i
to
him
in
time
we
indulged
in
long
idle
rambles
anywhere
either
going
first
by
streetcar
boat
or
train
somewhere
and
then
walking
or
if
the
mood
was
not
so
just
walking
on
and
on
somewhere
and
talking
on
such
occasions
peter
was
at
his
best
and
i
could
have
listened
forever
quite
as
the
disciples
of
plato
and
aristotle
must
have
to
them
to
his
discourses
on
life
his
broad
and
broadening
conceptions
of
nature
her
cruelty
beauty
mystery
once
far
out
somewhere
beyond
camden
we
were
idling
about
an
inlet
where
were
boats
and
some
fishermen
and
a
trestle
which
crossed
it
just
as
we
were
crossing
it
some
men
in
a
boat
below
discovered
the
body
of
a
possible
suicide
in
the
water
days
old
and
discolored
but
still
intact
and
with
the
clothes
of
a
man
of
at
least
means
i
was
for
leaving
being
made
a
little
sick
by
the
mere
sight
not
so
peter
he
was
for
joining
in
the
effort
which
brought
the
body
to
shore
and
in
a
moment
was
back
with
the
small
group
of
watermen
speculating
and
arguing
as
to
the
condition
and
character
of
the
dead
man
making
himself
really
one
of
the
group
finally
he
was
urging
the
men
to
search
the
pockets
while
some
one
went
for
the
police
but
more
than
anything
with
a
hard
and
yet
in
its
way
humane
realism
which
put
any
courage
of
mine
in
that
direction
to
the
blush
he
was
all
for
meditating
on
the
state
and
nature
of
man
his
chemical
components
chlorine
sulphuric
acid
phosphoric
acid
potassium
sodium
calcium
magnesium
oxygen
and
speculating
as
to
which
particular
chemicals
in
combination
gave
the
strange
metallic
blues
greens
yellows
and
browns
to
the
decaying
flesh
he
had
a
great
stomach
for
life
the
fact
that
insects
were
at
work
shocked
him
not
at
all
he
speculated
as
to
their
duties
and
functions
he
asserted
boldly
that
man
was
merely
a
chemical
formula
at
best
that
something
much
wiser
than
he
had
prepared
him
for
some
not
very
brilliant
purpose
of
his
or
its
own
perhaps
and
that
he
or
it
whoever
or
whatever
he
or
it
was
was
neither
good
nor
bad
as
we
imagined
such
things
but
both
he
at
once
went
off
into
the
mysteries
where
when
with
me
at
least
he
seemed
to
prefer
to
dwell
talked
of
the
divinations
of
the
chaldeans
how
they
studied
the
positions
of
the
stars
and
the
entrails
of
dead
animals
before
going
to
war
talked
of
the
horrible
fetiches
of
the
africans
the
tricks
and
speculations
of
the
priests
of
greek
and
roman
temples
finally
telling
me
the
story
of
the
ambitious
who
anchored
the
dead
horse
in
the
stream
in
order
to
have
plenty
of
eels
every
morning
for
market
i
revolted
i
declared
he
was
sickening
my
boy
he
assured
me
you
are
too
you
ca
take
life
that
way
it
all
good
to
me
whatever
happens
we
here
we
not
running
it
why
be
afraid
to
look
at
it
the
chemistry
of
a
man
body
is
any
worse
than
the
chemistry
of
anything
else
and
we
eating
the
dead
things
we
killed
all
the
time
a
little
more
or
a
little
less
in
any
direction
what
difference
apropos
of
this
same
a
little
later
to
shock
me
of
course
as
he
well
knew
he
could
he
assured
me
that
in
eating
a
dish
of
chop
suey
in
a
chinese
restaurant
a
very
low
one
he
had
found
and
eaten
a
part
of
the
little
finger
of
a
child
and
that
it
was
very
good
very
good
indeed
dog
i
protested
swine
thou
ghoula
but
he
merely
chuckled
heartily
and
stuck
to
his
tale
but
if
i
paint
this
side
of
him
it
is
to
round
out
his
wonderful
to
me
almost
incredible
figure
insisting
on
such
things
he
was
still
and
always
warm
and
human
sympathetic
diplomatic
and
cautious
according
to
his
company
so
that
he
was
really
acceptable
anywhere
peter
would
never
shock
those
who
did
not
want
to
be
shocked
a
minute
or
two
or
five
after
such
a
discourse
as
the
above
he
might
be
describing
some
marvelously
beautiful
process
of
pollination
among
the
flowers
the
history
of
some
medieval
trade
guild
or
gazing
at
a
beautiful
scene
and
conveying
to
one
by
his
very
attitude
his
unspoken
emotion
after
spending
about
two
or
three
years
in
philadelphia
which
city
came
to
reflect
for
me
the
color
of
peter
interests
and
mood
he
suddenly
removed
to
newark
having
been
nursing
an
arrangement
with
its
principal
paper
for
some
time
some
quarrel
or
dissatisfaction
with
the
director
of
his
department
caused
him
without
other
notice
to
paste
some
crisp
quotation
from
one
of
the
poets
on
his
desk
and
depart
in
newark
a
city
to
which
before
this
i
had
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
he
found
himself
most
happy
and
i
living
in
new
york
close
at
hand
felt
that
i
possessed
in
it
and
him
an
earthly
paradise
although
it
contained
no
more
than
people
and
seemed
or
had
a
drear
factory
realm
only
he
soon
revealed
it
to
me
in
quite
another
light
because
he
was
there
very
swiftly
he
found
a
wondrous
canal
running
right
through
it
under
its
market
even
and
we
went
walking
along
its
banks
out
into
the
woods
and
fields
he
found
or
created
out
of
an
existing
boardinghouse
in
a
back
street
so
colorful
and
gay
a
thing
that
after
a
time
it
seemed
to
me
to
outdo
that
one
of
philadelphia
he
joined
a
country
club
near
passaic
on
the
river
of
that
name
on
the
veranda
of
which
we
often
dined
he
found
a
chinese
quarter
with
a
restaurant
or
two
an
amazing
italian
section
with
a
restaurant
a
man
who
had
a
collection
of
rare
japanese
and
chinese
curios
all
in
his
rooms
at
the
essex
county
insane
asylum
for
he
was
the
chemist
there
a
man
who
was
a
playwright
and
manager
in
new
york
another
who
owned
a
newspaper
syndicate
another
who
directed
a
singing
society
another
who
was
president
of
a
gun
club
another
who
owned
and
made
or
rather
fired
pottery
for
others
peter
was
so
restless
and
vital
that
he
was
always
branching
out
in
a
new
direction
to
my
astonishment
he
now
took
up
the
making
and
firing
of
pottery
for
himself
being
interested
in
reproducing
various
chinese
dishes
and
vases
of
great
beauty
the
originals
of
which
were
in
the
metropolitan
museum
of
art
his
plan
was
first
to
copy
the
design
then
buy
shape
or
bake
the
clay
at
some
pottery
then
paint
or
decorate
with
liquid
porcelain
at
his
own
home
and
fire
in
the
course
of
six
or
eight
months
working
in
his
rooms
saturdays
and
sundays
and
some
mornings
before
going
to
the
office
he
managed
to
produce
three
or
four
which
satisfied
him
and
which
he
kept
plates
of
real
beauty
the
others
he
gave
away
a
little
later
if
you
please
it
was
turkish
on
a
small
scale
the
frame
and
materials
for
which
he
slowly
accumulated
and
then
providing
himself
with
a
pillow
he
crossed
his
legs
before
it
and
began
slowly
but
surely
to
produce
a
rug
the
colors
and
design
of
which
were
entirely
satisfactory
to
me
as
may
be
imagined
it
was
slow
and
tedious
work
undertaken
at
odd
moments
and
when
there
was
nothing
else
for
him
to
do
always
when
the
light
was
good
and
never
at
night
for
he
maintained
that
the
coloring
required
the
best
of
light
before
this
odd
homely
wooden
machine
a
combination
of
unpainted
rods
and
cords
he
would
sit
or
on
a
bench
at
times
and
pound
and
pick
and
tie
and
unravel
a
most
task
to
me
for
heaven
sake
i
once
observed
could
you
think
of
anything
more
interestingly
insane
to
do
than
this
it
the
slowest
most
painstaking
work
i
ever
saw
that
just
it
and
that
just
why
i
like
it
he
replied
never
looking
at
me
but
proceeding
with
his
weaving
in
the
most
industrious
fashion
you
have
just
one
outstanding
fault
dreiser
you
do
know
how
to
make
anything
out
of
the
little
things
of
life
you
want
to
remember
that
this
is
an
art
not
a
job
i
discovering
whether
i
can
make
a
turkish
carpet
or
not
and
it
gives
me
pleasure
if
i
can
get
so
much
as
one
good
spot
of
color
worked
out
one
small
portion
of
the
design
i
be
satisfied
i
know
then
that
i
can
do
it
the
whole
thing
do
you
see
some
of
these
things
have
been
the
work
of
a
lifetime
of
one
man
you
call
that
a
small
thing
i
do
the
pleasure
is
in
doing
it
proving
that
you
can
not
in
the
rug
itself
he
clacked
and
tied
congratulating
himself
vastly
in
due
course
of
time
three
or
four
inches
were
finished
a
soft
and
yet
firm
silky
fabric
and
he
was
in
great
glee
over
it
showing
it
to
all
and
insisting
that
in
time
how
long
i
often
wondered
he
would
complete
it
and
would
then
own
a
splendid
carpet
it
was
at
this
time
that
he
built
about
him
in
newark
a
structure
of
friendships
and
interests
which
it
seemed
to
me
promised
to
be
for
life
he
interested
himself
intensely
in
the
paper
with
which
he
was
connected
and
although
he
was
only
the
cartoonist
still
it
was
not
long
before
various
departments
and
elements
in
connection
with
it
seemed
to
reflect
his
presence
and
to
be
alive
with
his
own
good
will
and
enthusiasm
publisher
editor
art
director
managing
editor
and
business
manager
were
all
in
friendly
contact
with
him
he
took
out
life
insurance
for
the
benefit
of
the
wife
and
children
he
was
later
to
have
with
the
manager
of
the
engraving
department
he
was
working
out
problems
in
connection
with
copperplate
engraving
and
printing
with
the
official
photographer
art
photography
with
the
art
director
some
scheme
for
enlarging
the
local
museum
in
some
way
with
his
enduring
love
of
the
fantastic
and
ridiculous
it
was
not
long
before
he
had
successfully
planned
and
executed
a
hoax
of
the
most
ridiculous
character
a
piece
of
idle
drollery
almost
too
foolish
to
think
of
and
yet
which
eventually
succeeded
in
exciting
the
natives
of
at
least
four
states
and
was
telegraphed
to
and
talked
about
in
a
sunday
feature
way
by
newspapers
all
over
the
country
and
finally
involved
peter
as
an
actor
and
stage
manager
of
the
most
vivid
type
imaginable
and
yet
it
was
all
done
really
to
amuse
himself
to
see
if
he
could
do
it
as
he
often
told
me
this
particular
hoax
related
to
that
silly
old
bugaboo
of
our
boyhood
days
the
escaped
and
wandering
wild
man
ferocious
terrible
i
knew
nothing
of
it
until
peter
one
sunday
afternoon
when
we
were
off
for
a
walk
a
year
or
two
after
he
had
arrived
in
newark
suddenly
announced
apropos
of
nothing
at
all
dreiser
i
just
hit
upon
a
great
idea
which
i
am
working
out
with
some
of
the
boys
down
on
our
paper
it
a
dusty
old
fake
but
it
will
do
as
well
as
any
other
better
than
if
it
were
a
really
decent
idea
i
inventing
a
wild
man
you
know
how
crazy
the
average
dub
is
over
anything
strange
different
barnum
was
right
you
know
there
one
born
every
minute
well
i
just
getting
this
thing
up
now
it
as
good
as
the
sacred
white
elephant
or
the
hippopotamus
and
more
i
going
to
stage
it
right
here
in
little
old
newark
and
all
fall
for
it
and
do
you
think
they
wo
and
he
chuckled
most
ecstatically
for
heaven
sake
what
coming
now
i
sighed
oh
very
well
but
i
have
it
all
worked
out
just
the
same
beginning
to
run
the
preliminary
telegrams
every
three
or
four
days
one
from
ramblersville
south
jersey
let
us
say
another
from
hohokus
miles
farther
on
four
or
five
days
later
by
degrees
as
spring
comes
on
i
bring
him
north
right
up
here
into
essex
county
a
genuine
wild
man
see
something
fierce
and
terrible
we
giving
him
long
hair
like
a
bison
red
eyes
fangs
big
hands
and
feet
entirely
naked
or
will
be
when
he
gets
here
he
eight
feet
tall
he
kills
and
eats
horses
dogs
cattle
pigs
chickens
he
frightens
men
and
women
and
children
i
having
him
bound
across
lonely
roads
look
in
windows
at
night
stampede
cattle
and
drive
tramps
and
peddlers
out
of
the
country
but
say
wait
and
see
as
summer
comes
on
we
make
a
regular
headliner
of
it
we
give
it
pages
on
sunday
we
get
the
rubes
to
looking
for
him
in
posses
offer
rewards
maybe
some
one
will
actually
capture
and
bring
in
some
poor
lunatic
a
real
wild
man
you
can
do
anything
if
you
just
stir
up
the
natives
enough
i
laughed
you
crazy
i
said
what
a
low
comedian
you
really
are
peter
well
the
weeks
passed
and
to
mark
progress
he
occasionally
sent
me
clippings
of
telegrams
cut
not
from
his
pages
if
you
please
but
from
such
austere
journals
as
the
and
of
new
york
the
of
philadelphia
the
of
hartford
recording
the
antics
of
his
imaginary
thing
of
the
woods
longish
articles
actually
began
to
appear
here
and
there
in
eastern
papers
especially
describing
the
exploits
of
this
very
elusive
and
moving
demon
he
had
been
seen
in
a
dozen
fairly
widely
distributed
places
within
the
month
but
always
coming
northward
in
one
place
he
had
killed
three
cows
at
once
in
another
two
and
eaten
portions
of
them
raw
old
gorswitch
of
dutchers
run
pennsylvania
returning
from
a
visit
to
her
annie
gorswitch
and
ambling
along
a
lonely
road
in
osgoroola
county
was
suddenly
descended
upon
by
a
most
horrific
figure
half
man
half
beast
very
tall
and
with
long
hair
and
red
all
but
bloody
eyes
who
looking
at
her
with
avid
glance
made
as
if
to
seize
her
but
a
wagon
approaching
along
the
road
from
another
direction
he
had
desisted
and
fled
leaving
old
gorswitch
in
a
faint
upon
the
ground
barns
and
haystacks
had
been
fired
here
and
there
lonely
widows
in
distant
cotes
been
made
to
abandon
their
homes
through
fear
i
marveled
at
the
assiduity
and
patience
of
the
man
one
day
in
june
or
july
following
being
in
newark
and
asking
peter
quite
idly
about
his
wild
man
he
replied
oh
it
great
great
could
be
better
he
soon
be
here
now
we
got
the
whole
thing
arranged
now
for
next
sunday
or
saturday
depends
on
which
day
i
can
get
off
we
going
to
photograph
him
wanto
come
over
what
rot
i
said
who
going
to
pose
where
well
he
chuckled
come
along
and
see
you
find
out
fast
enough
we
got
an
actual
wild
man
i
got
him
i
have
him
out
here
in
the
woods
if
you
do
believe
it
come
over
you
would
believe
me
when
i
said
i
could
get
the
natives
worked
up
well
they
are
look
at
these
and
he
produced
clippings
from
rival
papers
the
wild
man
was
actually
being
seen
in
essex
county
not
miles
from
newark
he
had
ravaged
the
property
of
people
in
five
different
states
it
was
assumed
that
he
was
a
lunatic
turned
savage
or
that
he
had
escaped
from
a
circus
or
wrecked
on
the
jersey
coast
suggestions
made
by
peter
himself
his
depredations
all
told
had
by
now
run
into
thousands
speaking
financially
staid
residents
were
excited
rewards
for
his
capture
were
being
offered
in
different
places
posses
of
irate
citizens
were
and
would
continue
to
be
after
him
armed
to
the
teeth
until
he
was
captured
quite
remarkable
developments
might
be
expected
at
any
time
i
stared
it
seemed
too
ridiculous
and
it
was
and
back
of
it
all
was
smirking
chuckling
peter
the
center
and
fountain
of
it
you
dog
i
protested
you
clown
he
merely
grinned
not
to
miss
so
interesting
a
dénouement
as
the
actual
capture
of
this
prodigy
of
the
wilds
i
was
up
early
and
off
the
following
sunday
to
newark
where
in
peter
apartment
in
due
time
i
found
him
his
rooms
in
a
turmoil
he
himself
busy
stuffing
things
into
a
bag
outside
an
automobile
waiting
and
within
it
the
staff
photographer
as
well
as
several
others
all
grinning
and
all
of
whom
as
he
informed
me
were
to
assist
in
the
great
work
of
tracking
ambushing
and
if
possible
photographing
the
dread
peril
yes
well
who
going
to
be
him
i
insisted
never
mind
never
mind
do
be
so
inquisitive
chortled
peter
a
wild
man
has
his
rights
and
privileges
as
well
as
any
other
remember
i
caution
all
of
you
to
be
respectful
in
his
presence
he
very
sensitive
and
he
does
like
newspapermen
anyhow
he
be
photographed
and
he
be
wild
that
all
you
need
to
know
in
due
time
we
arrived
at
as
comfortable
an
abode
for
a
wild
man
as
well
might
be
it
was
near
the
old
essex
and
morris
canal
not
far
from
boonton
a
charming
clump
of
brush
and
rock
was
selected
and
here
a
snapshot
of
a
posse
hunting
men
peering
cautiously
from
behind
trees
in
groups
and
looking
as
though
they
were
most
eager
to
discover
something
was
made
then
peter
slipping
away
i
suddenly
saw
him
ambling
toward
us
hair
upstanding
body
smeared
with
black
muck
daubs
of
white
about
the
eyes
little
tufts
of
wool
about
wrists
and
ankles
and
loins
as
good
a
figure
of
a
wild
man
as
one
might
wish
only
not
eight
feet
tall
peter
i
said
how
ridiculous
you
loon
have
a
care
how
you
address
me
he
replied
with
solemn
dignity
a
wild
man
is
a
wild
man
our
punctilio
is
not
to
be
trifled
with
i
am
of
the
oldest
the
most
famous
line
of
wild
men
extant
touch
me
not
he
strode
the
grass
with
the
air
of
a
popular
movie
star
while
he
discussed
with
the
art
director
and
photographer
the
most
terrifying
and
convincing
attitudes
of
a
wild
man
seen
by
accident
and
unconscious
of
his
pursuers
but
you
not
eight
feet
tall
i
interjected
at
one
point
a
small
matter
a
small
matter
he
replied
airily
i
will
be
in
the
picture
nothing
easier
we
wild
men
you
know
some
of
the
views
were
excellent
most
striking
he
leered
most
terribly
from
arras
of
leaves
or
indicated
fright
or
cunning
the
man
was
a
good
actor
for
years
i
retained
and
may
still
have
somewhere
a
full
set
of
the
pictures
as
well
as
the
spread
which
followed
the
next
week
well
the
thing
was
appropriately
discussed
as
it
should
have
been
but
the
wild
man
got
away
as
was
feared
he
went
into
the
nearby
canal
and
washed
away
all
his
terror
or
rather
he
vanished
into
the
dim
recesses
of
peter
memory
he
was
only
heard
of
a
few
times
more
in
the
papers
his
supposed
body
being
found
in
some
town
in
northeast
pennsylvania
or
in
the
small
item
that
was
telegraphed
from
there
as
for
peter
he
emerged
from
the
canal
or
from
its
banks
a
cleaner
if
not
a
better
man
he
was
grinning
combing
his
hair
adjusting
his
tie
what
a
scamp
i
insisted
lovingly
what
an
incorrigible
trickster
dreiser
dreiser
he
chortled
there
nothing
like
it
you
should
not
scoff
i
am
a
public
benefactor
i
am
really
a
creator
i
have
created
a
being
as
distinct
as
any
that
ever
lived
he
is
in
many
minds
mine
yours
you
know
that
you
believe
in
him
really
there
he
was
peeking
out
from
between
those
bushes
only
fifteen
minutes
ago
and
he
has
made
and
will
make
thousands
of
people
happy
thrill
them
give
them
a
new
interest
if
stevenson
can
create
a
jekyll
and
hyde
why
ca
i
create
a
wild
man
i
have
we
have
his
picture
to
prove
it
what
more
do
you
wish
i
acquiesced
all
told
it
was
a
delightful
bit
of
foolery
and
art
and
peter
was
what
he
was
first
and
foremost
an
artist
in
the
grotesque
and
the
ridiculous
for
some
time
thereafter
peace
seemed
to
reign
in
his
mind
only
now
it
was
that
the
marriage
and
home
and
children
idea
began
to
grow
from
much
of
the
foregoing
it
may
have
been
assumed
that
peter
was
out
of
sympathy
with
the
ordinary
routine
of
life
despised
the
commonplace
the
purely
practical
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
just
the
other
way
about
i
never
knew
a
man
so
radical
in
some
of
his
viewpoints
so
versatile
and
yet
so
wholly
intentionally
and
cravingly
immersed
in
the
usual
as
peter
he
was
all
for
creating
developing
brightening
life
along
simple
rather
than
outré
lines
in
so
far
as
he
himself
was
concerned
nearly
all
of
his
arts
and
pleasures
were
decorative
and
homey
a
good
grocer
a
good
barber
a
good
a
good
tailor
a
shoe
maker
was
just
as
interesting
in
his
way
to
peter
as
any
one
or
anything
else
if
not
a
little
more
so
he
respected
their
lines
their
arts
their
professions
and
above
all
where
they
had
it
their
industry
sobriety
and
desire
for
fair
dealing
he
believed
that
millions
of
men
especially
those
about
him
were
doing
the
best
they
could
under
the
very
severe
conditions
which
life
offered
he
objected
to
the
idle
the
too
dull
the
swindlers
and
thieves
as
well
as
the
officiously
puritanic
or
dogmatic
he
resented
for
himself
at
least
solemn
pomp
and
show
little
houses
little
gardens
little
porches
simple
cleanly
neighborhoods
with
their
air
of
routine
industry
convention
and
order
fascinated
him
as
apparently
nothing
else
could
he
insisted
that
they
were
enough
a
man
did
not
need
a
great
house
unless
he
was
a
public
character
with
official
duties
dreiser
he
would
say
in
philadelphia
and
newark
if
not
before
in
just
such
a
neighborhood
as
this
that
some
day
i
going
to
live
going
to
have
my
little
my
seven
children
my
chickens
dog
cat
canary
best
german
style
my
garden
my
birdbox
my
pipe
and
sundays
by
god
i
march
all
off
to
church
wife
and
seven
kids
as
regular
as
clockwork
shined
shoes
pigtails
and
all
and
i
lead
the
procession
yes
yes
i
said
you
talk
well
wait
and
see
nothing
in
this
world
means
so
much
to
me
as
the
good
old
orderly
home
stuff
one
ought
to
live
and
die
in
a
family
the
right
way
i
cutting
up
now
sowing
my
wild
oats
but
nothing
i
just
getting
ready
to
eventually
settle
down
and
live
just
as
i
tell
you
and
be
an
ideal
orderly
citizen
it
the
only
way
the
way
nature
intends
us
to
do
all
this
early
kid
stuff
is
passing
a
process
we
get
over
it
every
fellow
does
or
ought
to
be
able
to
if
he
worth
anything
find
some
one
woman
that
he
can
live
with
and
stick
by
her
that
makes
the
world
that
you
and
i
like
to
live
in
and
you
know
it
there
a
psychic
call
in
all
of
us
to
it
i
think
it
the
genius
of
our
civilization
to
marry
one
woman
and
settle
down
and
when
i
do
no
more
of
this
stuff
with
this
that
and
the
other
lady
i
be
a
model
husband
and
father
sure
as
you
standing
there
do
you
think
i
wo
smile
if
you
want
to
it
so
i
have
my
garden
i
be
friendly
with
my
neighbors
you
can
come
over
then
and
help
us
put
the
kids
to
bed
oh
lord
this
is
a
new
bug
now
we
have
the
cot
idea
for
a
while
anyhow
oh
all
right
scoff
if
you
want
to
you
see
time
went
by
he
was
doing
all
the
things
i
have
indicated
living
in
a
kind
of
whirl
of
life
at
the
same
time
from
time
to
time
he
would
come
back
to
this
thought
once
it
is
true
i
thought
it
was
all
over
with
the
little
girl
in
philadelphia
he
talked
of
her
occasionally
but
less
and
less
out
on
the
golf
links
near
passaic
he
met
another
girl
one
of
a
group
that
flourished
there
i
met
her
she
was
not
unpleasing
a
bit
sensuous
rather
attractive
in
dress
and
manners
not
very
well
informed
but
gay
clever
such
a
girl
as
would
pass
among
other
women
as
fairly
satisfactory
for
a
time
peter
seemed
greatly
attracted
to
her
she
danced
played
a
little
was
fair
at
golf
and
tennis
and
she
was
or
pretended
to
be
intensely
interested
in
him
he
confessed
at
last
that
he
believed
he
was
in
love
with
her
so
it
all
day
with
philadelphia
is
it
i
asked
it
a
shame
he
replied
but
i
afraid
so
i
having
a
hell
of
a
time
with
myself
my
alleged
conscience
i
tell
you
i
heard
little
more
about
it
he
had
a
fad
for
collecting
rings
at
this
time
a
whole
casket
full
like
a
hindu
prince
and
he
told
me
once
he
was
giving
her
her
choice
of
them
suddenly
he
announced
that
it
was
all
off
and
that
he
was
going
to
marry
the
maid
of
philadelphia
he
had
thrown
the
solitaire
engagement
ring
he
had
given
her
down
a
sewer
at
first
he
would
confess
nothing
as
to
the
reason
or
the
details
but
being
so
close
to
me
it
eventually
came
out
apparently
to
the
others
as
to
myself
he
had
talked
much
of
his
simple
home
plans
his
future
children
the
good
citizen
idea
he
had
talked
it
to
his
new
love
also
and
she
had
sympathized
and
agreed
yet
one
day
after
he
had
endowed
her
with
the
engagement
ring
some
one
a
member
of
the
golf
club
came
and
revealed
a
tale
the
girl
was
not
straight
she
had
been
mayhap
was
even
then
intimate
with
other
men
one
anyhow
she
was
in
love
with
peter
well
enough
as
she
insisted
afterward
and
willing
to
undertake
the
life
he
suggested
but
she
had
not
broken
with
the
old
atmosphere
completely
or
if
she
had
it
was
still
not
believed
that
she
had
there
were
those
who
could
not
only
charge
but
prove
a
compromising
note
of
some
kind
sent
to
some
one
was
involved
turned
over
to
peter
dreiser
he
growled
as
he
related
the
case
to
me
it
serves
me
right
i
ought
to
know
better
i
know
the
kind
of
woman
i
need
this
one
has
handed
me
a
damned
good
wallop
and
i
deserve
it
i
might
have
guessed
that
she
was
suited
to
me
she
was
really
too
free
a
more
than
a
wife
that
home
stuff
she
was
just
stringing
me
because
she
liked
me
she
is
really
my
sort
not
simple
enough
but
you
loved
her
i
thought
i
did
or
thought
i
did
still
i
used
to
wonder
too
there
were
many
ways
about
her
that
troubled
me
you
think
i
kidding
about
this
home
and
family
idea
but
i
not
it
suits
me
however
flat
it
looks
to
you
i
want
to
do
that
live
that
way
go
through
the
normal
routine
experience
and
i
going
to
do
it
but
how
did
you
break
it
off
with
her
so
swiftly
i
asked
curiously
well
when
i
heard
this
i
went
direct
to
her
and
put
it
up
to
her
if
you
believe
me
she
never
even
denied
it
said
it
was
all
true
but
that
she
was
in
love
with
me
all
right
and
would
change
and
be
all
that
i
wanted
her
to
be
well
that
fair
enough
i
said
if
she
loves
you
you
no
saint
yourself
you
know
if
you
encourage
her
maybe
she
make
good
well
maybe
but
i
do
think
so
really
he
returned
shaking
his
head
she
likes
me
but
not
enough
i
afraid
she
would
run
straight
now
that
she
had
this
other
she
mean
to
maybe
but
she
would
i
feel
it
about
her
and
anyhow
i
do
want
to
take
any
chances
i
like
her
i
crazy
about
her
really
but
i
through
going
to
marry
little
dutchy
if
she
have
me
and
cut
out
this
stuff
you
have
to
stand
up
with
me
when
i
do
in
three
months
more
the
new
arrangement
was
consummated
and
little
dutchy
or
zuleika
as
he
subsequently
named
her
was
duly
brought
to
newark
and
installed
at
first
in
a
charming
apartment
in
a
conventionally
respectable
and
cleanly
neighborhood
later
in
a
small
house
with
a
yard
lawn
front
and
back
in
one
of
the
homiest
of
home
neighborhoods
in
newark
it
was
positively
entertaining
to
observe
peter
not
only
attempting
to
assume
but
assuming
the
rôle
of
the
conventional
husband
and
exactly
nine
months
after
he
had
been
married
to
the
hour
a
father
in
this
humble
and
yet
in
so
far
as
his
particular
home
was
concerned
comfortable
world
i
have
no
space
here
for
more
than
the
barest
outline
i
have
already
indicated
his
views
most
emphatically
expressed
and
forecasted
he
fulfilled
them
all
to
the
letter
up
to
the
day
of
his
death
in
so
far
as
i
could
make
out
he
made
about
as
satisfactory
a
husband
and
father
and
citizen
as
i
have
ever
seen
he
did
it
deliberately
in
cold
reason
and
yet
with
a
warmth
and
flare
which
puzzled
me
all
the
more
since
it
based
on
reason
and
forethought
i
misdoubted
i
was
not
quite
willing
to
believe
that
it
would
work
out
and
yet
if
ever
a
home
was
delightful
with
a
charming
and
genuinely
happy
atmosphere
it
was
peter
here
she
is
he
observed
the
day
he
married
her
me
zuleika
is
she
a
peach
ever
see
any
nicer
hair
than
that
and
these
here
now
pink
cheeks
what
look
at
and
her
little
dutchy
nose
it
cute
oh
dutchy
and
right
here
in
me
vest
pocket
is
the
golden
band
wherewith
i
am
to
be
chained
to
the
floor
the
domestic
hearth
and
right
there
on
her
finger
is
my
badge
of
prospective
serfdom
then
in
a
loud
aside
to
me
in
six
months
i
be
beating
her
come
now
zuleika
we
have
to
go
through
with
this
you
have
to
swear
to
be
my
slave
and
so
they
were
married
and
in
the
home
afterward
he
was
as
busy
and
helpful
and
noisy
as
any
man
about
the
house
could
ever
hope
to
be
he
was
always
fussing
about
after
hours
putting
up
something
or
arranging
his
collections
or
helping
zuleika
wash
and
dry
the
dishes
or
showing
her
how
to
cook
something
if
she
did
know
how
he
was
running
to
the
store
or
bringing
home
things
from
the
downtown
market
months
before
the
first
child
was
born
he
was
declaring
most
shamelessly
in
a
few
months
now
dreiser
zuleika
and
i
are
going
to
have
our
first
calf
the
bones
roll
for
a
boy
but
you
never
can
tell
i
offering
up
prayers
and
oblations
both
of
us
are
i
make
zuleika
pray
every
night
and
say
when
it
comes
no
stuff
no
bawling
or
rocking
it
to
sleep
nights
permitted
here
one
kid
that
going
to
be
raised
right
i
worked
out
all
the
rules
no
trashy
good
old
specially
brewed
culmbacher
for
the
mother
and
the
kid
afterwards
if
it
wants
it
this
is
one
family
in
which
law
and
order
are
going
to
prevail
good
old
wichtig
law
and
order
i
used
to
chuckle
the
while
i
verbally
denounced
him
for
his
coarse
plebeian
point
of
view
and
tastes
in
a
little
while
the
child
came
and
to
his
immense
satisfaction
it
was
a
boy
i
never
saw
a
man
carry
on
so
make
over
it
take
such
a
interest
in
all
those
little
things
which
supposedly
made
for
its
health
and
for
the
first
few
weeks
he
still
talked
of
not
having
it
petted
or
spoiled
but
at
the
same
time
he
was
surely
and
swiftly
changing
and
by
the
end
of
that
time
had
become
the
most
doting
almost
ridiculously
fond
papa
that
i
ever
saw
always
the
child
must
be
in
his
lap
at
the
most
unseemly
hours
when
his
wife
would
permit
it
when
he
went
anywhere
or
they
although
they
kept
a
maid
the
child
must
be
carried
along
by
him
on
his
shoulder
he
liked
nothing
better
than
to
sit
and
hold
it
close
rocking
in
a
american
style
and
singing
or
come
tramping
into
my
home
in
new
york
the
child
looking
like
a
woolen
ball
at
night
if
it
stirred
or
whimpered
he
was
up
and
looking
and
the
and
the
cradle
and
the
toys
colored
rubber
balls
and
soldiers
the
first
or
second
or
third
week
what
about
that
stern
discipline
that
was
to
be
put
in
force
here
no
rocking
no
getting
up
at
night
to
coddle
a
weeping
infant
yes
i
know
that
all
good
stuff
before
you
get
one
i
got
one
of
my
own
now
and
i
got
a
new
light
on
this
say
dreiser
take
my
advice
go
through
the
routine
do
try
to
escape
have
a
kid
or
two
or
three
there
a
psychic
punch
to
it
you
ca
get
any
other
way
it
nature
way
it
a
great
scheme
you
and
your
girl
and
your
kid
as
he
talked
he
rocked
holding
the
baby
boy
to
his
breast
it
was
wonderful
and
peter
how
happy
she
seemed
there
was
light
in
that
house
flowers
laughter
good
fellowship
as
in
his
old
rooms
so
in
this
new
home
he
gathered
a
few
of
his
old
friends
around
him
and
some
new
ones
friends
of
this
region
in
the
course
of
a
year
or
two
he
was
on
the
very
best
terms
of
friendship
with
his
barber
around
the
corner
his
grocer
some
man
who
had
a
saloon
and
bowling
alley
in
the
neighborhood
his
tailor
and
then
just
neighbors
the
milkman
the
coal
man
the
druggist
and
cigar
man
at
the
next
corner
all
could
tell
you
where
peter
lived
his
little
front
yard
had
two
beds
of
flowers
all
summer
long
his
lot
in
the
back
was
a
garden
lettuce
onions
peas
beans
peter
was
always
happiest
when
he
could
be
home
working
playing
with
the
baby
pushing
him
about
in
a
working
in
his
garden
or
lying
on
the
floor
making
something
an
engraving
or
print
or
a
box
which
he
was
carving
the
infant
in
some
simple
gingham
romper
crawling
about
he
was
always
busy
but
never
too
much
so
for
a
glance
or
a
now
say
not
so
much
industry
there
you
leave
my
things
alone
to
the
child
of
a
sunday
he
sat
out
on
the
front
porch
smoking
reading
the
sunday
paper
congratulating
himself
on
his
happy
married
life
and
most
of
the
time
holding
the
infant
afternoons
he
would
carry
it
somewhere
anywhere
in
his
arms
to
his
friends
the
park
new
york
to
see
me
at
breakfast
dinner
supper
the
heir
presumptive
was
in
a
beside
him
ah
now
here
a
rubber
spoon
beat
with
that
it
less
destructive
and
less
painful
physically
how
about
a
nice
prust
crust
dipped
in
bravery
gravy
heh
do
you
suppose
that
would
cut
any
of
your
teeth
zuleika
this
son
of
yours
seems
to
think
a
spoonful
of
beer
or
two
might
not
hurt
him
what
do
you
say
occasionally
especially
of
a
saturday
evening
he
wanted
to
go
bowling
and
yet
he
wanted
his
heir
the
problem
was
solved
by
fitting
the
latter
into
a
tight
little
sweater
and
cap
and
carrying
him
along
on
his
shoulder
into
the
bar
for
a
beer
thence
to
the
bowling
alley
where
young
hopeful
was
fastened
into
a
chair
on
the
side
lines
while
peter
and
myself
or
some
of
his
friends
bowled
at
ten
or
or
eleven
as
the
case
might
be
he
was
ready
to
leave
but
before
that
hour
les
ongfong
might
be
sound
asleep
hanging
against
peter
scarf
his
interest
in
his
toes
or
thumbs
having
given
out
peter
look
at
that
i
observed
once
do
you
think
we
better
take
him
home
home
nothing
let
him
sleep
he
can
sleep
here
as
well
as
anywhere
and
besides
i
like
to
look
at
him
and
in
the
room
would
be
a
great
crowd
cigars
beers
laughter
and
peter
various
friends
as
used
to
the
child
presence
and
as
charmed
by
it
as
he
was
he
was
just
the
man
who
could
do
such
things
his
manner
and
point
of
view
carried
conviction
he
believed
in
doing
all
that
he
wanted
to
do
simply
and
naturally
and
more
and
more
as
he
went
along
people
not
only
respected
i
think
they
adored
him
especially
the
simple
homely
souls
among
whom
he
chose
to
move
and
have
his
being
about
this
time
there
developed
among
those
in
his
immediate
neighborhood
a
desire
to
elect
him
to
some
political
position
that
of
councilman
or
state
assemblyman
in
the
hope
or
thought
that
he
would
rise
to
something
higher
but
he
would
none
of
it
not
then
anyhow
instead
about
this
time
or
a
very
little
later
after
the
birth
of
his
second
child
a
girl
he
devoted
himself
to
the
composition
of
a
brilliant
piece
of
prose
poetry
wolf
which
coming
from
him
did
not
surprise
me
in
the
least
if
he
had
designed
or
constructed
a
great
building
painted
a
great
picture
entered
politics
and
been
elected
governor
or
senator
i
would
have
taken
it
all
as
a
matter
of
course
he
could
have
the
material
from
which
anything
may
rise
was
there
i
asked
him
to
let
me
offer
it
to
the
publishing
house
with
which
i
was
connected
and
i
recall
with
interest
the
comment
of
the
oldest
and
most
experienced
of
the
bookmen
and
salesmen
among
us
you
never
make
much
if
anything
on
this
book
it
too
good
too
poetic
but
whether
it
pays
or
not
i
vote
yes
i
rather
lose
money
on
something
like
this
than
make
it
on
some
of
the
trash
we
do
make
it
on
amen
i
agreed
then
and
i
agree
now
the
last
phase
of
peter
was
as
interesting
and
dramatic
as
any
of
the
others
his
married
life
was
going
forward
about
as
he
had
planned
his
devotion
to
his
home
and
children
his
loving
wife
his
multiplex
interests
his
various
friends
was
always
a
curiosity
to
me
especially
in
view
of
his
olden
days
one
day
he
was
over
in
new
york
visiting
one
of
his
favorite
chinese
importing
companies
through
which
he
had
secured
and
was
still
securing
occasional
objects
of
art
he
had
come
down
to
me
in
my
office
at
the
butterick
building
to
see
if
i
would
not
come
over
the
following
saturday
as
usual
and
stay
until
monday
he
had
secured
something
was
planning
something
i
should
see
at
the
elevator
he
waved
me
a
gay
so
long
see
you
saturday
but
on
friday
as
i
was
talking
with
some
one
at
my
desk
a
telegram
was
handed
me
it
was
from
peter
and
read
peter
died
today
at
two
of
pneumonia
please
come
i
could
scarcely
believe
it
i
did
not
know
that
he
had
even
been
sick
his
little
wife
the
two
children
his
future
his
interests
i
dropped
everything
and
hurried
to
the
nearest
station
en
route
i
speculated
on
the
mysteries
on
which
he
had
so
often
speculated
death
dissolution
uncertainty
the
crude
indifference
or
cruelty
of
nature
what
would
become
of
peter
his
children
i
arrived
only
to
find
a
home
atmosphere
destroyed
as
by
a
wind
that
puts
out
a
light
there
was
peter
stiff
and
cold
and
in
the
other
rooms
his
babies
quite
unconscious
of
what
had
happened
prattling
as
usual
and
peter
practically
numb
and
speechless
it
had
come
so
suddenly
so
out
of
a
clear
sky
that
she
could
not
realize
could
not
even
tell
me
at
first
the
doctor
was
there
also
a
friend
of
his
the
nearest
barber
also
two
or
three
representatives
from
his
paper
the
owner
of
the
bowling
alley
the
man
who
had
the
collection
of
curios
all
were
stunned
as
i
was
as
his
closest
friend
i
took
charge
wired
his
relatives
went
to
an
undertaker
who
knew
him
to
arrange
for
his
burial
in
newark
or
philadelphia
as
his
wife
should
wish
she
having
no
connection
with
newark
other
than
peter
it
was
most
distressing
the
sense
of
dull
despair
and
unwarranted
disaster
which
hung
over
the
place
it
was
as
though
impish
and
pagan
forces
or
malign
ones
outside
life
had
committed
a
crime
of
the
ugliest
character
on
monday
the
day
he
saw
me
he
was
well
on
tuesday
morning
he
had
a
slight
cold
but
insisted
on
running
out
somewhere
without
his
overcoat
against
which
his
wife
protested
tuesday
night
he
had
a
fever
and
took
quinine
and
aspirin
and
a
hot
whiskey
wednesday
morning
he
was
worse
and
a
doctor
was
called
but
it
was
not
deemed
serious
wednesday
night
he
was
still
worse
and
pneumonia
had
set
in
thursday
he
was
lower
still
and
by
noon
a
metal
syphon
of
oxygen
was
sent
for
to
relieve
the
sense
of
suffocation
setting
in
thursday
night
he
was
weak
and
sinking
but
expected
to
come
round
and
still
so
unexpected
was
the
attack
so
uncertain
the
probability
of
anything
fatal
that
no
word
was
sent
even
to
me
friday
morning
he
was
no
worse
and
no
better
if
he
was
no
worse
by
night
he
might
pull
through
at
noon
he
was
seized
with
a
sudden
sinking
spell
oxygen
was
applied
by
his
wife
and
a
nurse
and
the
doctor
sent
for
by
he
was
lower
still
very
low
his
face
was
blue
his
lips
ashen
his
wife
told
me
we
put
the
oxygen
tube
to
his
mouth
and
i
said
you
speak
peter
i
was
so
nervous
and
frightened
he
moved
his
head
a
little
to
indicate
i
said
must
let
go
you
must
fight
think
of
me
think
of
the
babies
i
was
a
little
crazy
i
think
with
fear
he
looked
at
me
very
fixedly
he
stiffened
and
gritted
his
teeth
in
a
great
effort
then
suddenly
he
collapsed
and
lay
still
he
was
dead
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
the
force
and
energy
able
at
the
last
minute
when
he
could
not
speak
to
grit
his
teeth
and
fight
a
minute
before
his
death
what
is
the
human
spirit
or
mind
that
it
can
fight
so
to
the
very
last
i
felt
as
though
some
one
something
had
ruthlessly
killed
him
committed
plain
unpunished
murder
nothing
more
and
nothing
less
and
there
were
his
cases
of
curios
his
rug
his
prints
his
dishes
his
many
many
schemes
his
book
to
come
out
soon
i
gazed
and
marveled
i
looked
at
his
wife
and
babies
but
could
say
nothing
it
spelled
what
such
things
always
spell
in
the
face
of
all
our
dreams
crass
chance
or
the
willful
brutal
indifference
of
nature
to
all
that
relates
to
man
if
he
is
to
prosper
he
must
do
so
without
her
aid
that
same
night
sleeping
in
the
room
adjoining
that
in
which
was
the
body
a
pale
candle
burning
near
it
i
felt
as
though
peter
were
walking
to
and
fro
to
and
fro
past
me
and
into
the
room
of
his
wife
beyond
thinking
and
grieving
his
imagined
wraith
seemed
horribly
depressed
and
distressed
once
he
came
over
and
moved
his
hand
something
over
my
face
i
felt
him
walking
into
the
room
where
were
his
wife
and
kiddies
but
he
could
make
no
one
see
hear
understand
i
got
up
and
looked
at
his
a
long
time
then
went
to
bed
again
the
next
day
and
the
next
and
the
next
were
filled
with
many
things
his
mother
and
sister
came
on
from
the
west
as
well
as
the
mother
and
brother
of
his
wife
i
had
to
look
after
his
affairs
adjusting
the
matter
of
insurance
which
he
left
his
art
objects
the
burial
of
his
body
in
consecrated
ground
in
philadelphia
with
the
consent
and
aid
of
the
local
catholic
parish
rector
else
no
burial
his
mother
desired
it
but
he
had
never
been
a
good
catholic
and
there
was
trouble
the
local
parish
assistant
refused
me
even
the
rector
finally
i
threatened
the
good
father
with
an
appeal
to
the
diocesan
bishop
on
the
ground
of
plain
common
sense
and
courtesy
to
a
catholic
family
if
not
charity
to
a
tortured
mother
and
wife
and
obtained
consent
all
along
i
felt
as
if
a
great
crime
had
been
committed
by
some
one
foul
murder
i
could
not
get
it
out
of
my
mind
and
it
made
me
angry
not
sad
two
three
five
seven
years
later
i
visited
the
little
family
in
philadelphia
the
wife
was
with
her
mother
and
father
in
a
simple
little
home
street
in
a
factory
district
secretary
and
stenographer
to
an
architect
she
was
little
changed
a
little
stouter
not
so
carefree
industrious
patient
his
boy
the
petted
f
could
not
even
recall
his
father
the
girl
not
at
all
of
course
and
in
the
place
were
a
few
of
his
prints
two
or
three
chinese
dishes
pottered
by
himself
his
loom
with
the
unfinished
rug
i
remained
for
dinner
and
dreamed
old
dreams
but
i
was
uncomfortable
and
left
early
and
peter
accompanying
me
to
the
steps
looked
after
me
as
though
i
alone
was
all
that
was
left
of
the
old
life
doer
of
the
noank
is
a
little
fishing
town
on
the
southeastern
coast
of
connecticut
lying
between
new
london
and
stonington
once
it
was
a
profitable
port
for
mackerel
and
cod
fishing
today
its
wharves
are
deserted
of
all
save
a
few
lobster
smacks
there
is
a
shipyard
employing
three
hundred
and
fifty
men
a
establishment
with
two
or
three
hired
hands
a
and
some
dozen
or
so
shops
or
sheds
where
the
odds
and
ends
of
fishing
life
are
made
and
sold
everything
is
peaceful
the
sound
of
the
shipyard
axes
and
hammers
can
be
heard
for
miles
over
the
quiet
waters
of
the
bay
in
the
sunny
lane
which
follows
the
line
of
the
shore
and
along
which
a
few
shops
struggle
in
disorder
may
be
heard
the
voices
and
noises
of
the
workers
at
their
work
water
gurgling
about
the
stanchions
of
the
docks
the
whistle
of
some
fisherman
as
he
dawdles
over
his
nets
or
puts
his
fish
ashore
the
whirr
of
the
single
sewing
machine
in
the
often
mingle
in
a
pleasant
harmony
and
invite
the
mind
to
repose
and
speculation
i
was
in
a
most
examining
and
critical
mood
that
summer
looking
into
the
nature
and
significance
of
many
things
and
was
sitting
one
day
in
the
shed
of
the
maker
of
sailboats
where
a
characters
of
the
village
were
gathered
when
some
turn
in
the
conversation
brought
up
the
nature
of
man
he
is
queer
he
is
restless
life
is
not
so
very
much
when
you
come
to
look
upon
many
phases
of
it
did
any
of
you
ever
know
a
contented
man
i
inquired
idly
merely
for
the
sake
of
something
to
say
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
and
one
after
another
met
my
roving
glance
with
a
thoughtful
and
retrospective
eye
old
main
was
the
first
to
answer
yes
i
did
one
so
did
i
put
in
the
sailboat
maker
as
he
stopped
in
his
work
to
think
about
it
yes
and
i
did
said
a
dark
squat
sunny
little
old
fisherman
who
sold
cunners
for
bait
in
a
little
hut
next
door
maybe
you
and
me
are
thinking
of
the
same
one
jacob
said
old
main
looking
inquisitively
at
the
i
think
we
all
got
the
same
man
in
mind
likely
returned
the
builder
who
is
he
i
asked
charlie
potter
said
the
builder
that
the
man
exclaimed
main
yes
i
reckon
charlie
potter
is
contented
if
anybody
be
said
an
old
fisherman
who
had
hitherto
been
silent
such
unanimity
of
opinion
struck
me
forcibly
charlie
potter
what
a
humble
name
not
very
remarkable
to
say
the
least
and
to
hear
him
so
spoken
of
in
this
restless
religious
quibbling
community
made
it
all
the
more
interesting
so
you
really
think
he
is
contented
do
you
i
asked
yes
sir
charlie
potter
is
a
contented
man
replied
main
with
convincing
emphasis
well
i
returned
that
rather
interesting
what
sort
of
a
man
is
he
oh
he
just
an
ordinary
man
not
much
of
anybody
fishes
and
builds
boats
occasionally
put
in
the
is
that
all
nothing
else
he
preaches
now
and
then
not
regularly
said
main
i
thought
a
religionist
a
preacher
is
expected
to
set
a
good
example
i
said
he
ai
a
regular
preacher
said
main
rather
quickly
he
just
kind
of
around
in
religious
work
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
curiously
not
quite
catching
the
import
of
this
around
well
answered
the
boat
builder
he
do
take
any
money
for
what
he
does
he
ai
got
anything
what
does
he
live
on
then
i
persisted
still
wondering
at
the
significance
of
around
in
religious
work
i
do
know
he
used
to
fish
for
a
living
fishes
yet
once
in
a
while
i
believe
he
makes
models
of
yachts
put
in
one
of
the
bystanders
he
sold
the
new
haven
road
one
for
two
hundred
dollars
here
not
long
ago
a
vision
of
a
arose
before
me
a
visionary
a
theorist
what
else
i
asked
hoping
to
draw
them
out
what
makes
you
all
think
he
is
contented
what
does
he
do
that
makes
him
so
contented
well
said
main
after
a
considerable
pause
and
with
much
of
sympathetic
emphasis
in
his
voice
charlie
potter
is
just
a
good
man
that
all
that
why
he
contented
he
does
as
near
as
he
can
what
he
thinks
he
ought
to
by
other
people
poor
people
you
wo
find
anybody
with
a
kinder
heart
than
charlie
potter
put
in
the
that
the
trouble
with
him
really
he
too
good
he
do
look
after
himself
right
i
say
a
fellow
has
to
look
out
for
himself
some
in
this
world
if
he
do
no
one
else
will
right
you
are
henry
echoed
a
truculent
sea
voice
from
somewhere
i
was
becoming
both
amused
and
interested
intensely
so
if
he
was
that
way
he
be
a
darned
sight
better
off
than
he
is
said
a
helper
from
a
far
corner
of
the
room
what
makes
you
say
that
i
queried
is
it
better
to
be
and
generous
than
not
it
all
right
to
be
and
generous
but
that
ai
that
you
got
to
give
your
last
cent
away
and
let
your
family
go
hungry
is
that
what
charlie
potter
does
well
no
maybe
he
do
but
he
comes
mighty
near
to
it
at
times
he
and
his
wife
and
his
adopted
children
have
been
pretty
close
to
it
at
times
you
see
this
was
the
center
nearly
for
all
village
gossip
and
philosophic
speculation
and
many
of
the
most
important
local
problems
morally
and
intellectually
speaking
were
here
thrashed
put
there
no
doubt
but
that
where
charlie
is
wrong
put
in
old
main
a
little
later
he
do
always
stop
to
think
of
his
family
what
did
he
ever
do
that
struck
you
as
being
i
asked
of
the
young
man
who
had
spoken
from
the
corner
that
all
right
he
replied
in
a
rather
irritated
and
peevish
tone
i
ai
going
to
go
into
details
now
but
there
people
around
here
that
hang
on
him
and
that
he
give
to
that
he
had
orter
i
believe
in
lookin
out
for
number
one
that
what
i
believe
in
interrupted
the
laying
down
his
rule
and
line
this
up
everything
and
goin
without
yourself
may
be
all
right
but
i
believe
it
a
man
first
duty
is
to
his
wife
and
children
that
what
i
say
that
the
way
it
looks
to
me
put
in
main
well
does
potter
give
up
everything
and
go
without
things
i
asked
the
purty
blamed
near
it
at
times
he
returned
definitely
then
addressing
the
company
in
general
he
added
look
at
the
time
he
worked
over
there
on
fisher
island
at
the
ellersbie
farm
the
time
they
were
packing
the
ice
there
you
remember
that
henry
do
you
main
nodded
what
about
it
what
about
it
why
he
give
his
rubber
boots
away
like
a
darned
fool
to
old
drunken
jimmy
harper
and
him
loafin
around
half
the
year
drunk
and
worked
around
on
the
ice
without
any
shoes
himself
he
might
took
cold
and
died
why
did
he
do
it
i
queried
very
much
interested
by
now
oh
charlie
naturally
put
in
the
little
old
man
who
sold
cunners
he
believes
in
the
lord
and
the
bible
stands
right
square
on
it
only
he
do
belong
to
no
church
like
he
got
the
biggest
heart
i
ever
saw
in
a
livin
being
course
the
other
fellow
did
have
any
shoes
for
to
wear
put
in
the
explanatorily
but
he
never
would
work
anyhow
they
lapsed
into
silence
while
the
latter
returned
to
his
measuring
and
then
out
of
the
drift
of
thought
came
this
from
the
helper
in
the
corner
yes
and
look
at
the
way
bailey
used
to
sponge
on
him
get
his
money
saturday
night
and
drink
it
all
up
and
then
sunday
morning
when
his
wife
and
children
were
hungry
go
cryin
around
potter
dinged
if
helped
him
but
potter
take
the
food
right
off
his
breakfast
table
and
give
it
to
him
i
saw
him
do
it
i
do
think
that
right
not
when
he
got
four
or
five
orphans
of
his
own
to
care
for
his
own
children
i
interrupted
trying
to
get
the
thing
straight
no
sir
just
children
he
picked
up
around
here
and
there
here
is
a
curious
character
sure
enough
i
thought
one
well
worth
looking
into
another
lull
and
then
as
i
was
leaving
the
room
to
give
the
matter
a
little
quiet
attention
i
remarked
to
the
outside
of
his
foolish
giving
you
have
anything
against
charlie
potter
have
you
not
a
thing
he
replied
in
apparent
astonishment
charlie
one
of
the
best
men
that
ever
lived
he
a
good
man
i
smiled
at
the
inconsistency
and
went
my
way
a
day
or
two
later
the
loft
of
the
instead
of
the
shed
of
the
happened
to
be
my
lounging
place
and
thinking
of
this
theme
now
uppermost
in
my
mind
i
said
to
him
do
you
know
a
man
around
here
by
the
name
of
charlie
potter
well
i
might
say
that
i
do
he
lived
here
for
over
fifteen
years
what
sort
of
a
man
is
he
he
stopped
in
his
stitching
a
moment
to
look
at
me
and
then
said
how
d
mean
by
trade
so
to
speak
or
what
is
it
he
has
done
i
said
that
makes
him
so
popular
with
all
you
people
everybody
says
he
a
good
man
just
what
do
you
mean
by
that
well
he
said
ceasing
his
work
as
though
the
subject
were
one
of
extreme
importance
to
him
he
a
peculiar
man
charlie
is
he
believes
in
giving
nearly
everything
he
has
away
if
any
one
else
needs
it
give
the
coat
off
his
back
if
you
asked
him
for
it
some
folks
condemn
him
for
this
and
for
not
giving
everything
to
his
wife
and
them
orphans
he
has
but
i
always
thought
the
man
was
nearer
right
than
most
of
us
i
got
a
family
myself
but
then
so
he
now
for
that
matter
pretty
hard
to
live
up
to
your
light
always
he
looked
away
as
if
he
expected
some
objection
to
be
made
to
this
but
hearing
none
he
went
on
i
always
liked
him
personally
very
much
he
ai
around
here
now
any
more
lives
up
in
norwich
i
think
he
a
man
of
his
word
though
as
truthful
as
kin
be
he
ai
never
done
for
me
i
not
bein
a
takin
kind
but
that
neither
here
nor
there
he
paused
in
doubt
apparently
as
to
what
else
to
say
you
say
he
so
good
i
said
tell
me
one
thing
that
he
ever
did
that
struck
you
as
being
preëminently
good
well
now
i
ca
say
as
i
kin
exactly
offhand
he
replied
there
bein
so
many
of
them
from
time
to
time
he
was
always
doin
things
one
way
and
another
he
give
to
everybody
around
here
that
asked
him
and
to
a
good
many
that
did
i
remember
once
and
a
smile
gave
evidence
of
a
genial
memory
he
give
away
a
lot
of
pork
that
he
put
up
for
the
winter
to
some
colored
people
back
here
two
or
three
barrels
maybe
his
wife
did
object
exactly
but
my
how
his
did
go
on
about
it
she
was
livin
with
him
then
she
went
and
railed
against
him
all
around
she
did
like
to
give
it
to
them
eh
well
i
should
say
not
she
did
set
with
his
views
exactly
never
did
he
took
the
pork
though
it
was
right
in
the
coldest
weather
we
had
that
winter
and
hauled
it
back
about
seven
miles
here
to
where
they
lived
and
handed
it
all
out
himself
course
they
were
awful
hard
up
but
then
they
might
got
along
without
it
they
do
now
sometimes
charlie
too
good
that
way
it
his
one
fault
if
you
might
so
speak
of
it
i
smiled
as
the
evidence
accumulated
houseless
wayfarers
stopping
to
find
food
and
shelter
under
his
roof
an
orphan
child
carried
seven
miles
on
foot
from
the
bedside
of
a
dead
mother
and
cared
for
all
winter
three
children
besides
two
of
his
own
being
raised
out
of
a
sense
of
affection
and
care
for
the
fatherless
one
day
in
the
local
post
office
i
was
idling
a
half
hour
with
the
postmaster
when
i
again
inquired
do
you
know
charlie
potter
i
should
think
i
did
charlie
potter
and
i
sailed
together
for
something
over
eleven
years
how
do
you
mean
sailed
together
we
were
on
the
same
schooner
this
used
to
be
a
great
port
for
mackerel
and
cod
we
were
wrecked
once
together
how
was
that
oh
we
went
on
rocks
any
lives
lost
no
but
there
came
mighty
near
being
we
helped
each
other
in
the
boat
i
remember
charlie
was
the
last
one
in
that
time
would
get
in
until
all
the
rest
were
safe
a
sudden
resolution
came
to
me
do
you
know
where
he
is
now
yes
he
up
in
norwich
preaching
or
doing
missionary
work
he
kind
of
busy
all
the
time
among
the
poor
people
and
so
on
never
makes
much
of
anything
out
of
it
for
himself
but
just
likes
to
do
it
i
guess
do
you
know
how
he
manages
to
live
no
i
do
exactly
he
believes
in
trusting
to
providence
for
what
he
needs
he
works
though
too
at
one
job
and
another
he
a
carpenter
for
one
thing
got
an
idea
the
lord
will
send
whatever
he
needs
well
and
does
he
well
he
lives
a
little
later
he
added
oh
yes
there
nothing
lazy
about
charlie
he
a
good
worker
when
he
was
in
the
fishing
line
here
there
was
a
man
worked
harder
than
he
did
they
ca
anybody
lay
anything
like
that
against
him
is
he
very
difficult
to
talk
to
i
asked
meditating
on
seeking
him
out
i
had
so
little
to
do
at
the
time
the
very
idlest
of
summers
and
the
reports
of
this
man
deeds
were
haunting
me
i
wanted
to
discover
for
myself
whether
he
was
real
or
not
whether
the
reports
were
true
the
samaritan
in
people
is
so
easily
exaggerated
at
times
oh
no
he
one
of
the
finest
men
that
way
i
ever
knew
you
could
see
him
well
enough
if
you
went
up
to
norwich
providing
he
up
there
he
usually
is
though
i
think
he
lives
there
with
his
wife
and
mother
you
know
i
caught
an
afternoon
boat
for
new
london
and
norwich
at
and
arrived
in
norwich
at
five
the
narrow
streets
of
the
thriving
little
mill
city
were
alive
with
people
i
had
no
address
could
not
obtain
one
but
through
the
open
door
of
a
near
the
boat
landing
i
called
to
the
proprietor
do
you
know
any
one
in
norwich
by
the
name
of
charlie
potter
the
man
who
works
around
among
the
poor
people
here
that
the
man
yes
i
know
him
he
lives
out
on
summer
street
number
twelve
i
think
you
find
it
in
the
city
directory
the
ready
reply
was
rather
astonishing
norwich
has
something
like
thirty
thousand
people
i
walked
out
in
search
of
summer
street
and
finally
found
a
beautiful
lane
of
that
name
climbing
upward
over
gentle
slopes
arched
completely
with
elms
some
of
the
pretty
porches
of
the
cottages
extended
nearly
to
the
sidewalk
hammocks
on
verandas
benches
under
the
trees
all
attested
the
love
of
idleness
and
shade
in
summer
only
the
glimpse
of
mills
and
factories
in
the
valley
below
evidenced
the
grimmer
life
which
gave
rise
mayhap
to
the
need
of
a
man
to
work
among
the
poor
is
this
summer
street
i
inquired
of
an
old
darky
who
was
strolling
cityward
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
an
umbrella
was
under
his
arm
and
an
evening
paper
under
his
spectacled
nose
bress
de
lord
he
said
looking
vaguely
around
ah
could
say
ah
knows
dat
street
been
on
it
fifty
times
but
ah
never
did
know
de
name
ha
ha
ha
the
hills
about
echoed
his
hearty
laugh
you
do
happen
to
know
charlie
potter
oh
yas
sah
ah
knows
charlie
potter
dat
his
house
right
ovah
dar
the
house
in
which
charlie
potter
lived
was
a
frame
overhanging
a
sharp
slope
which
descended
directly
to
the
waters
of
the
pretty
river
below
for
a
mile
or
more
the
valley
of
the
river
could
be
seen
its
slopes
dotted
with
houses
the
valley
itself
lined
with
mills
two
little
girls
were
upon
the
sloping
lawn
to
the
right
of
the
house
a
stout
man
was
sitting
by
a
window
on
the
left
side
of
the
house
gazing
out
over
the
valley
is
this
where
charlie
potter
lives
i
inquired
of
one
of
the
children
yes
sir
did
he
live
in
noank
yes
sir
just
then
a
woman
of
or
fifty
issued
from
a
door
mr
potter
she
replied
to
my
inquiry
he
be
right
out
she
went
about
some
little
work
at
the
side
of
the
house
and
in
a
moment
charlie
potter
appeared
he
was
short
and
weighed
no
less
than
two
hundred
pounds
his
face
and
hands
were
sunburned
and
brown
like
those
of
every
fisherman
of
noank
an
old
wrinkled
coat
and
a
baggy
pair
of
gray
trousers
clothed
his
form
loosely
two
inches
of
a
spotted
hat
were
pulled
carelessly
over
his
eyes
his
face
was
round
and
full
but
slightly
seamed
his
hands
were
large
his
walk
uneven
and
rather
inclined
to
a
side
swing
or
the
sailor
roll
he
seemed
an
odd
pudgy
person
for
so
large
a
fame
is
this
mr
potter
i
the
man
i
live
on
a
little
hummock
at
the
east
of
mystic
island
off
noank
you
do
i
came
up
to
have
a
talk
with
you
will
you
come
inside
or
shall
we
sit
out
here
let
sit
on
the
step
all
right
let
sit
on
the
step
he
waddled
out
of
the
gate
and
sank
comfortably
on
the
little
low
doorstep
with
his
feet
on
the
cool
bricks
below
i
dropped
into
the
space
beside
him
and
was
greeted
by
as
sweet
and
kind
a
look
as
i
have
ever
seen
in
a
man
eyes
it
was
one
of
perfect
courtesy
and
good
nature
void
of
all
suspicion
we
were
sitting
down
in
the
sailboat
maker
place
at
noank
the
other
day
and
i
asked
a
half
dozen
of
the
old
fellows
whether
they
had
ever
known
a
contented
man
they
all
thought
a
while
and
then
they
said
they
had
old
main
and
the
rest
of
them
agreed
that
charlie
potter
was
a
contented
man
what
i
want
to
know
is
are
you
i
looked
quizzically
into
his
eyes
to
see
what
effect
this
would
have
and
if
there
was
no
evidence
of
a
mist
of
pleasure
and
affection
being
vigorously
restrained
i
was
very
much
mistaken
something
seemed
to
hold
the
man
in
helpless
silence
as
he
gazed
vacantly
at
nothing
he
breathed
heavily
then
drew
himself
together
and
lifted
one
of
his
big
hands
as
if
to
touch
me
but
refrained
yes
brother
he
said
after
a
time
i
well
that
good
i
replied
taking
a
slight
mental
exception
to
the
use
of
the
word
brother
what
makes
you
contented
i
do
know
unless
it
is
that
i
found
out
what
i
ought
to
do
you
see
i
need
so
very
little
for
myself
that
i
could
be
very
unhappy
what
ought
you
to
do
i
ought
to
love
my
fellowmen
and
do
you
say
brother
but
i
do
he
insisted
quite
simply
and
with
no
evidence
of
chicane
or
a
simple
natural
enthusiasm
i
love
everybody
there
is
anybody
so
low
or
so
mean
but
i
love
him
i
love
you
yes
i
do
i
love
you
he
reached
out
and
touched
me
with
his
hand
and
while
i
was
inclined
to
take
exception
to
this
very
moral
enthusiasm
i
thrilled
just
the
same
as
i
have
not
over
the
touch
of
any
man
in
years
there
was
something
effective
and
electric
about
him
so
very
warm
and
foolishly
human
the
glance
which
accompanied
it
spoke
it
seemed
as
truthfully
as
his
words
he
probably
did
love
me
or
thought
he
did
what
difference
we
lapsed
into
silence
the
scene
below
was
so
charming
that
i
could
easily
gaze
at
it
in
silence
this
little
house
was
very
simple
not
poor
by
no
means
prosperous
but
such
a
home
as
such
a
man
might
have
after
a
while
i
said
it
is
very
evident
that
you
think
the
condition
of
some
of
your
fellowmen
is
what
it
ought
to
be
tell
me
what
you
are
trying
to
do
what
method
have
you
for
improving
their
condition
the
way
i
reason
is
he
began
all
that
some
people
have
is
their
feelings
nothing
else
take
a
tramp
for
instance
as
i
often
have
when
you
begin
to
sum
up
to
see
where
to
begin
you
find
that
all
he
has
in
the
world
besides
his
pipe
and
a
little
tobacco
is
his
feelings
it
all
most
people
have
rich
or
poor
though
a
good
many
think
they
have
more
than
that
i
try
not
to
injure
anybody
feelings
he
looked
at
me
as
though
he
had
expressed
the
solution
of
the
difficulties
of
the
world
and
the
wonderful
kindly
eyes
beamed
in
rich
romance
upon
the
scene
very
good
i
said
but
what
do
you
do
how
do
you
go
about
it
to
aid
your
fellowmen
well
he
answered
unconsciously
overlooking
his
own
personal
actions
in
the
matter
i
try
to
bring
them
the
salvation
which
the
bible
teaches
you
know
i
stand
on
the
bible
from
cover
to
cover
yes
i
know
you
stand
on
the
bible
but
what
do
you
do
you
merely
preach
the
bible
to
them
what
do
you
do
no
sir
i
do
preach
the
bible
at
all
i
stand
on
it
myself
i
try
as
near
as
i
can
to
do
what
it
says
i
go
wherever
i
can
be
useful
if
anybody
is
sick
or
in
trouble
i
ready
to
go
i
be
a
nurse
work
and
earn
them
food
i
give
them
anything
i
can
that
what
i
do
how
can
you
give
when
you
have
anything
they
told
me
in
noank
that
you
never
worked
for
money
not
for
myself
alone
i
never
take
any
money
for
myself
alone
that
would
be
anything
i
earn
or
take
is
for
the
lord
not
me
i
never
keep
it
the
lord
does
allow
a
man
to
be
well
then
when
you
get
money
what
do
you
do
with
it
you
ca
do
and
live
without
money
he
had
been
looking
away
across
the
river
and
the
bridge
to
the
city
below
but
now
he
brought
his
eyes
back
and
fixed
them
on
me
i
been
working
now
for
twenty
years
or
more
and
although
never
had
more
money
than
would
last
me
a
few
days
at
a
time
i
never
wanted
for
anything
and
i
been
able
to
help
others
i
run
pretty
close
sometimes
time
and
time
again
i
been
compelled
to
say
i
all
out
of
coal
or
i
going
to
have
to
ask
you
to
get
me
my
fare
to
new
haven
tomorrow
but
in
the
moment
of
my
need
he
has
never
forgotten
me
why
i
gone
down
to
the
depot
time
and
time
again
when
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
go
without
five
cents
in
my
pocket
and
he
been
there
to
meet
me
why
he
would
keep
you
waiting
when
you
about
his
work
he
would
forget
you
not
for
a
minute
i
looked
at
the
man
in
amazement
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
would
go
down
to
a
depot
without
money
and
wait
for
money
to
come
to
you
oh
brother
he
said
with
the
softest
light
in
his
eyes
if
you
only
knew
what
it
is
to
have
faith
he
laid
his
hand
softly
on
mine
what
is
to
new
haven
or
to
anywhere
to
him
but
i
replied
materially
you
have
any
when
you
go
there
how
do
you
actually
get
it
who
gives
it
to
you
give
me
one
instance
why
it
was
only
last
week
brother
that
a
woman
wrote
me
from
maiden
massachusetts
wanting
me
to
come
and
see
her
she
very
sick
with
consumption
and
she
thought
she
was
going
to
die
i
used
to
know
her
in
noank
and
she
thought
if
she
could
get
to
see
me
she
would
feel
better
i
did
have
any
money
at
the
time
but
that
did
make
any
difference
i
said
a
woman
sick
in
maiden
and
she
wants
me
to
come
to
her
i
have
got
any
money
but
i
go
right
down
to
the
depot
in
time
to
catch
a
certain
train
and
i
went
and
while
i
was
standing
there
a
man
came
up
to
me
and
said
i
told
to
give
you
this
and
he
handed
me
ten
dollars
did
you
know
the
man
i
exclaimed
never
saw
him
before
in
my
life
he
replied
smiling
genially
and
did
he
say
anything
more
than
that
no
i
stared
at
him
and
he
added
as
if
to
take
the
edge
off
my
astonishment
why
bless
your
heart
i
knew
he
was
from
the
lord
just
the
moment
i
saw
him
coming
you
mean
to
say
you
were
standing
there
without
a
cent
expecting
the
lord
to
help
you
and
he
did
shall
call
upon
me
and
i
shall
answer
him
he
answered
simply
quoting
the
psalm
this
incident
was
still
the
subject
of
my
inquiry
when
a
little
colored
girl
came
out
of
the
yard
and
paused
a
moment
before
us
may
i
go
down
across
the
bridge
papa
she
asked
yes
he
answered
and
then
as
she
tripped
away
said
she
one
of
my
adopted
children
he
gazed
between
his
knees
at
the
sidewalk
have
you
many
others
three
raising
them
are
you
yes
they
seem
to
think
down
in
noank
that
living
as
you
do
and
giving
everything
away
is
satisfactory
to
you
but
rather
hard
on
your
wife
and
children
well
it
is
true
that
she
did
feel
a
little
uncertain
in
the
beginning
but
she
never
wanted
for
anything
she
tell
you
herself
that
never
been
without
a
thing
that
she
really
needed
and
she
been
happy
he
paused
to
meditate
i
presume
over
the
opinion
of
his
former
fellow
townsmen
and
then
added
it
true
there
have
been
times
when
we
have
been
right
where
we
had
to
have
certain
things
pretty
badly
before
they
came
but
they
never
failed
to
come
while
he
was
still
talking
potter
came
around
the
corner
of
the
house
and
out
upon
the
sidewalk
she
was
going
to
the
saturday
evening
market
in
the
city
below
here
she
is
he
said
now
you
can
ask
her
what
is
it
she
inquired
turning
a
serene
and
smiling
face
to
me
they
still
think
down
in
noank
that
you
not
very
happy
with
me
he
said
they
afraid
you
want
for
something
once
in
a
while
she
took
this
piece
of
neighborly
interference
in
better
fashion
than
most
would
i
fancy
i
have
never
wanted
for
anything
since
i
have
been
married
to
my
husband
she
said
i
am
thoroughly
contented
she
looked
at
him
and
he
at
her
and
there
passed
between
them
an
affectionate
glance
yes
he
said
when
she
had
passed
after
a
pleasing
little
conversation
my
wife
has
been
a
great
help
to
me
she
has
never
complained
people
are
inclined
to
talk
a
little
i
said
well
you
see
she
never
complained
but
she
did
feel
a
little
bit
worried
in
the
beginning
have
you
a
mission
or
a
church
here
in
norwich
no
i
do
believe
in
churches
not
in
churches
no
the
sight
of
a
minister
preaching
the
word
of
god
for
so
much
a
year
is
all
a
mockery
to
me
what
do
you
believe
in
personal
service
churches
and
charitable
institutions
and
societies
are
all
valueless
you
ca
reach
your
fellowman
that
way
they
build
up
buildings
and
pay
salaries
but
there
a
better
way
i
was
thinking
of
francis
and
his
original
dream
before
they
threw
him
out
and
established
monasteries
and
a
costume
or
uniform
the
thing
he
so
much
objected
to
this
giving
of
a
few
old
clothes
that
the
moths
will
get
anyhow
that
wo
do
you
got
to
give
something
of
yourself
and
that
affection
love
is
the
only
thing
you
can
really
give
in
all
this
world
when
you
give
love
you
give
everything
everything
comes
with
it
in
some
way
or
other
how
do
you
say
i
queried
money
certainly
comes
handy
sometimes
yes
when
you
give
it
with
your
own
hand
and
heart
in
no
other
way
it
comes
to
nothing
just
contributed
to
some
thing
ah
he
added
with
sudden
animation
the
tangles
men
can
get
themselves
into
the
snarls
the
wretchedness
troubles
with
women
with
men
whom
they
owe
with
evil
things
they
say
and
think
until
they
ca
walk
down
the
street
any
more
without
peeping
about
to
see
if
they
are
followed
they
ca
look
you
in
die
face
ca
walk
a
straight
course
but
have
got
to
sneak
around
corners
poor
miserable
unhappy
they
worrying
and
crying
and
dodging
one
another
he
paused
lost
in
contemplation
of
the
picture
he
had
conjured
up
yes
i
went
on
catechistically
determined
if
i
could
to
rout
out
this
matter
of
giving
this
actual
example
of
the
modus
operandi
of
christian
charity
what
do
you
do
how
do
you
get
along
without
giving
them
money
i
do
get
along
without
giving
them
some
money
there
are
cases
lots
of
them
where
a
little
money
is
necessary
but
brother
it
is
so
little
necessary
at
times
it
is
always
money
they
want
you
reach
them
with
old
clothes
and
charity
societies
he
insisted
got
to
love
them
brother
you
got
to
go
to
them
and
love
them
just
as
they
are
scarred
and
miserable
and
yes
i
replied
doubtfully
deciding
to
follow
this
up
later
but
just
what
is
it
you
do
in
a
needy
case
one
instance
why
one
night
i
was
passing
a
little
house
in
this
town
he
went
on
and
i
heard
a
woman
crying
i
went
right
to
the
door
and
opened
it
and
when
i
got
inside
she
just
stopped
and
looked
at
me
i
said
have
come
to
help
you
if
i
can
now
you
tell
me
what
you
crying
for
well
sir
you
know
she
sat
there
and
told
me
how
her
husband
drank
and
how
she
did
have
anything
in
the
house
to
eat
and
so
i
just
gave
her
all
i
had
and
told
her
i
would
see
her
husband
for
her
and
the
next
day
i
went
and
hunted
him
up
and
said
to
him
brother
i
wish
you
would
open
your
eyes
and
see
what
you
are
doing
i
wish
you
would
do
that
any
more
it
only
misery
you
are
creating
and
you
know
i
got
to
telling
about
how
badly
his
wife
felt
about
it
and
how
i
intended
to
work
and
try
and
help
her
and
bless
me
if
he
did
up
and
promise
me
before
i
got
through
that
he
would
do
that
any
more
and
he
did
he
working
today
and
it
been
two
years
since
i
went
to
him
nearly
his
eyes
were
alight
with
his
appreciation
of
personal
service
yes
that
one
instance
i
said
oh
there
are
plenty
of
them
he
replied
it
the
only
way
down
here
in
new
london
a
couple
of
winters
ago
we
had
a
terrible
time
of
it
that
was
the
winter
of
the
panic
you
know
cold
my
but
that
was
a
cold
winter
and
thousands
of
people
out
of
work
just
thousands
it
was
awful
i
tried
to
do
what
i
could
here
and
there
all
along
but
finally
things
got
so
bad
there
that
i
went
to
the
mayor
i
saw
they
were
raising
some
kind
of
a
fund
to
help
the
poor
so
i
told
him
that
if
give
me
a
little
of
the
money
they
were
talking
of
spending
that
feed
the
hungry
for
a
a
meal
a
a
meal
yes
sir
they
all
thought
it
was
rather
curious
not
possible
at
first
but
they
gave
me
the
money
and
i
fed
good
meals
yes
as
good
as
i
ever
eat
myself
he
replied
how
did
you
do
it
i
asked
oh
i
can
cook
i
just
went
around
to
the
markets
and
told
the
what
i
wanted
heads
of
mackerel
and
the
part
of
the
halibut
that
left
after
the
rich
man
cuts
off
his
steak
it
the
poorest
part
that
he
pays
for
you
know
and
i
went
fishing
myself
two
or
three
times
borrowed
a
big
boat
and
got
men
to
help
me
oh
i
a
good
fisherman
you
know
and
then
i
got
the
loan
of
an
old
covered
brickyard
that
no
one
was
using
any
more
a
great
big
thing
that
i
could
close
up
and
build
fires
in
and
i
put
my
kettle
in
there
and
rigged
up
tables
out
of
borrowed
boards
and
got
people
to
loan
me
plates
and
spoons
and
knives
and
forks
and
cups
i
made
fish
chowder
and
fish
dinners
and
really
i
set
a
very
fine
table
i
did
that
winter
for
a
a
meal
yes
sir
a
a
meal
ask
any
one
in
new
london
all
it
cost
me
the
mayor
said
he
was
surprised
at
the
way
i
did
it
well
but
there
was
any
particular
personal
service
in
the
money
they
gave
you
i
asked
catching
him
up
on
that
point
they
personally
serve
those
who
gave
you
the
money
no
sir
they
did
he
replied
dreamily
with
unconscious
simplicity
but
they
gave
through
me
you
see
that
the
way
it
was
i
gave
the
personal
service
do
you
see
that
the
way
yes
that
the
way
i
smiled
avoiding
as
far
as
possible
a
further
discussion
of
this
contradiction
so
unconscious
on
his
part
and
in
the
drag
of
his
thought
he
took
up
another
idea
i
clothed
that
winter
too
went
around
and
got
barrels
and
boxes
of
old
clothing
some
of
them
felt
a
little
ashamed
to
put
on
the
things
but
i
got
over
that
all
right
i
was
wearing
them
myself
and
i
just
told
them
feel
badly
brother
i
wearing
them
out
of
the
same
barrel
with
you
i
wearing
them
out
of
the
same
barrel
got
my
clothes
entirely
free
for
that
winter
can
you
always
get
all
the
aid
you
need
for
such
enterprises
usually
and
then
i
can
earn
a
good
deal
of
money
when
i
work
steadily
i
can
get
a
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
for
a
little
yacht
you
know
every
time
i
find
time
to
make
one
and
i
can
make
a
good
deal
of
money
out
of
fishing
i
went
out
fishing
here
on
the
fourth
of
july
and
caught
two
hundred
blackfish
four
and
five
pounds
almost
every
one
of
them
that
ought
to
be
profitable
i
said
well
it
was
he
replied
how
much
did
you
get
for
them
oh
i
did
sell
them
he
said
i
never
take
money
for
my
work
that
way
i
gave
them
all
away
what
did
you
do
i
asked
laughing
advertise
for
people
to
come
for
them
no
my
wife
took
some
and
my
daughters
and
i
took
the
rest
and
we
carried
them
around
to
people
that
we
thought
would
like
to
have
them
well
that
was
so
profitable
was
it
i
commented
amusedly
yes
they
were
fine
fish
he
replied
not
seeming
to
have
heard
me
we
dropped
the
subject
of
personal
service
at
this
point
and
i
expressed
the
opinion
that
his
service
was
only
a
temporary
expedient
times
changed
and
with
them
people
they
forgot
perhaps
those
he
aided
were
none
the
better
for
accepting
his
charity
i
know
what
you
mean
he
said
but
that
do
make
any
difference
you
just
have
to
keep
on
giving
that
all
see
not
all
of
turn
back
it
helps
a
lot
money
is
the
only
dangerous
thing
to
give
but
i
never
give
money
not
very
often
i
give
myself
rather
as
much
as
possible
i
give
food
and
clothing
too
but
i
try
to
show
a
new
way
that
not
money
you
know
so
many
people
need
a
new
way
looking
for
it
often
only
they
do
seem
to
know
how
but
god
dear
brother
however
poor
or
mean
they
are
he
knows
you
got
to
reach
the
heart
you
know
and
i
let
him
help
me
you
got
to
make
a
man
over
in
his
soul
if
you
want
to
help
him
and
money
wo
help
you
to
do
that
you
know
no
it
wo
he
looked
up
at
me
in
faith
it
was
remarkable
make
them
over
i
queried
still
curious
for
it
was
all
like
a
romance
and
rather
fantastic
to
me
what
do
you
mean
how
do
you
make
them
over
oh
in
their
attitude
that
how
you
got
to
change
a
man
and
bring
him
out
of
if
you
really
want
to
make
him
good
most
men
are
so
tangled
up
in
their
own
errors
and
bad
ways
and
so
worried
over
their
seekings
that
unless
you
can
set
them
to
giving
it
no
use
they
always
seeking
and
they
do
know
what
they
want
half
the
time
money
is
the
thing
why
half
of
them
would
understand
how
to
use
it
if
they
had
it
their
minds
are
not
bright
enough
their
perceptions
are
not
clear
enough
all
you
can
do
is
to
make
them
content
with
themselves
and
that
giving
to
others
will
do
i
never
saw
the
man
or
the
woman
yet
who
could
be
happy
if
you
could
make
them
feel
the
need
of
living
for
others
of
doing
something
for
somebody
besides
themselves
it
a
fact
selfish
people
are
never
happy
he
rubbed
his
hands
as
if
he
saw
the
solution
of
the
difficulties
very
clearly
and
i
said
to
him
well
now
you
got
a
man
out
of
the
mire
and
as
you
call
it
and
then
what
what
comes
next
well
then
he
saved
he
replied
happiness
comes
next
content
i
know
but
must
he
go
to
church
or
conform
to
certain
rules
no
no
no
he
replied
sweetly
nothing
to
do
except
to
be
good
to
others
religion
and
undefiled
before
our
god
and
father
is
this
he
quoted
visit
the
widow
and
the
orphan
in
their
affliction
and
to
keep
unspotted
from
the
world
charity
is
kind
you
know
vaunteth
not
itself
is
not
puffed
up
seeketh
not
its
own
well
i
said
rather
aimlessly
i
will
admit
for
this
high
faith
staggered
me
how
high
how
high
and
then
what
well
then
the
world
would
come
about
it
would
be
so
much
better
all
the
misery
is
in
the
lack
of
sympathy
one
with
another
when
we
get
that
straightened
out
we
can
work
in
peace
there
are
lots
of
things
to
do
you
know
yes
i
thought
looking
down
on
the
mills
and
the
driving
force
of
on
greed
lust
love
of
pleasure
all
their
fantastic
and
yet
moving
dreams
i
an
ignorant
man
myself
and
i
do
know
all
he
went
on
and
like
to
study
my
but
i
like
to
look
into
all
things
but
i
ca
do
it
now
we
ca
stop
until
this
thing
is
straightened
out
some
time
maybe
and
he
looked
peacefully
away
by
the
way
i
said
whatever
became
of
the
man
to
whom
you
gave
your
rubber
boots
over
on
fisher
island
his
face
lit
up
as
if
it
were
the
most
natural
thing
that
i
should
know
about
it
say
he
exclaimed
in
the
most
pleased
and
confidential
way
as
if
we
were
talking
about
a
mutual
friend
i
saw
him
not
long
ago
and
do
you
know
he
a
good
man
now
really
he
is
sober
and
and
say
would
you
believe
it
he
told
me
that
i
was
the
cause
of
it
just
that
miserable
old
pair
of
rubber
boots
what
do
you
think
of
that
i
shook
his
hand
at
parting
and
as
we
stood
looking
at
each
other
in
the
shadow
of
the
evening
i
asked
him
are
you
afraid
to
die
say
brother
but
i
not
he
returned
it
has
any
terror
for
me
at
all
i
just
as
willing
my
but
i
willing
he
smiled
and
gripped
me
heartily
again
and
as
i
was
starting
to
go
said
if
i
die
tonight
it
be
all
right
he
use
me
just
as
long
as
he
needs
me
that
i
know
i
called
back
he
hung
by
his
fence
looking
down
upon
the
city
as
i
turned
the
next
corner
i
saw
him
awakening
from
his
reflection
and
waddling
stolidly
back
into
the
house
brother
i
like
best
to
think
of
him
as
he
was
at
the
height
of
his
reputation
and
success
when
as
the
author
and
composer
of
various
american
popular
successes
on
the
banks
of
the
wabash
just
tell
them
that
you
saw
me
and
various
others
as
a
third
owner
of
one
of
the
most
successful
popular
music
publishing
houses
in
the
city
and
as
an
actor
and
playwright
of
some
small
repute
he
was
wont
to
spin
like
a
moth
in
the
white
light
of
broadway
by
reason
of
a
little
luck
and
some
talent
he
had
come
so
far
done
so
much
for
himself
in
his
day
he
had
been
by
turn
a
novitiate
in
a
western
seminary
which
trained
aspirants
for
the
catholic
priesthood
a
singer
and
entertainer
with
a
perambulating
oil
troupe
or
wagon
hamlin
wizard
oil
traveling
throughout
ohio
indiana
and
illinois
both
and
with
one
two
or
three
different
minstrel
companies
of
repute
the
editor
or
originator
and
author
of
a
funny
column
in
a
western
small
city
paper
the
author
of
the
songs
mentioned
and
a
hundred
others
a
monologue
artist
a
ditto
at
tony
pastor
miner
and
niblo
of
the
old
days
a
comic
lead
and
star
in
such
melodramas
and
farces
as
the
danger
signal
the
two
johns
a
tin
soldier
the
midnight
bell
a
green
goods
man
a
farce
which
he
himself
wrote
by
the
way
and
others
the
man
had
a
genius
for
the
kind
of
gayety
poetry
and
romance
which
may
and
no
doubt
must
be
looked
upon
as
exceedingly
but
which
nonetheless
had
as
much
charm
as
anything
in
this
world
can
well
have
he
had
at
this
time
absolutely
no
cares
or
financial
worries
of
any
kind
and
this
plus
his
health
disposition
and
talent
for
entertaining
made
him
a
most
fascinating
figure
to
contemplate
my
first
recollection
of
him
is
of
myself
as
a
boy
often
and
he
a
man
of
my
oldest
brother
he
had
come
back
to
the
town
in
which
we
were
then
living
solely
to
find
his
mother
and
help
her
six
or
seven
years
before
he
had
left
without
any
explanation
as
to
where
he
was
going
tired
of
or
irritated
by
the
routine
of
a
home
which
for
any
genuine
opportunity
it
offered
him
might
as
well
never
have
existed
it
was
run
dominantly
by
my
father
in
the
interest
of
religious
and
moral
theories
with
which
this
boy
had
little
sympathy
he
was
probably
not
understood
by
any
one
save
my
mother
who
understood
or
at
least
sympathized
with
us
all
placed
in
a
school
which
was
to
turn
him
out
a
priest
he
had
decamped
and
now
seven
years
later
was
here
in
this
small
town
with
fur
coat
and
silk
hat
a
smart
cane
a
gentleman
of
the
theatrical
profession
he
had
joined
a
minstrel
show
somewhere
and
had
become
an
he
had
suspected
that
we
were
not
as
fortunate
in
this
world
goods
as
might
be
and
so
had
returned
his
really
great
heart
had
called
him
but
the
thing
which
haunts
me
and
which
was
typical
of
him
then
as
throughout
life
was
the
spirit
which
he
then
possessed
and
conveyed
it
was
one
of
an
agile
geniality
unmarred
by
thought
of
a
serious
character
but
warm
and
genuinely
tender
and
with
a
taste
for
simple
beauty
which
was
most
impressive
he
was
already
the
author
of
a
cheap
songbook
paul
dresser
all
the
songs
sung
in
the
show
and
some
copies
of
this
he
had
with
him
one
of
which
he
gave
me
but
we
having
no
musical
instrument
of
any
kind
he
taught
me
some
of
the
melodies
by
ear
the
home
in
which
by
force
of
poverty
we
were
compelled
to
live
was
most
unprepossessing
and
inconvenient
and
the
result
of
his
coming
could
but
be
our
request
for
or
at
least
the
obvious
need
of
assistance
still
he
was
as
much
an
enthusiastic
part
of
it
as
though
he
belonged
to
it
he
was
happy
in
it
and
the
cause
of
his
happiness
was
my
mother
of
whom
he
was
intensely
fond
i
recall
how
he
hung
about
her
in
the
kitchen
or
wherever
she
happened
to
be
how
enthusiastically
he
related
all
his
plans
for
the
future
his
amusing
difficulties
in
the
past
he
was
very
grand
and
youthfully
or
so
we
all
thought
and
still
he
patted
her
on
the
shoulder
or
put
his
arm
about
her
and
kissed
her
until
she
died
years
later
she
was
truly
his
uppermost
thought
crying
with
her
at
times
over
her
troubles
and
his
he
contributed
regularly
to
her
support
and
sent
home
all
his
clothing
to
be
made
over
for
the
younger
ones
bless
her
tired
hands
as
i
look
back
now
on
my
life
i
realize
quite
clearly
that
of
all
the
members
of
my
family
subsequent
to
my
mother
death
the
only
one
who
truly
understood
me
or
better
yet
sympathized
with
my
intellectual
and
artistic
point
of
view
was
strange
as
it
may
seem
this
same
paul
my
dearest
brother
not
that
he
was
in
any
way
fitted
intellectually
or
otherwise
to
enjoy
high
forms
of
art
and
learning
and
so
guide
me
or
that
he
understood
even
in
later
years
long
after
i
had
written
sister
carrie
for
instance
what
it
was
that
i
was
attempting
to
do
he
never
did
his
world
was
that
of
the
popular
song
the
actor
or
comedian
the
comedy
and
such
humorous
æsthetes
of
the
writing
world
as
bill
nye
petroleum
nasby
the
authors
of
the
spoopendyke
papers
and
samantha
at
saratoga
as
far
as
i
could
make
out
and
i
say
this
in
no
lofty
condescending
spirit
by
any
means
he
was
entirely
full
of
simple
romance
humor
tenderness
and
grossness
all
of
which
i
am
very
free
to
say
early
disarmed
and
won
me
completely
and
kept
me
so
much
his
debtor
that
i
should
hesitate
to
try
to
acknowledge
or
explain
all
that
he
did
for
or
meant
to
me
imagine
if
you
can
a
man
weighing
all
of
three
hundred
pounds
not
more
than
five
feet
inches
in
height
and
yet
of
so
lithesome
a
build
that
he
gave
not
the
least
sense
of
either
undue
weight
or
lethargy
his
temperament
always
ebullient
and
radiant
presented
him
as
a
clever
eager
cheerful
emotional
and
always
highly
illusioned
person
with
so
a
warmth
that
one
found
him
compelling
interest
and
even
admiration
easily
cast
down
at
times
by
the
most
trivial
matters
at
others
and
for
the
most
part
he
was
so
spirited
and
bubbly
and
emotional
and
sentimental
that
your
fiercest
or
most
gloomy
intellectual
rages
or
moods
could
scarcely
withstand
his
smile
this
tenderness
or
sympathy
of
his
a
very
human
appreciation
of
the
weaknesses
and
errors
as
well
as
the
toils
and
tribulations
of
most
of
us
was
by
far
his
outstanding
and
most
engaging
quality
and
gave
him
a
very
definite
force
and
charm
admitting
as
i
freely
do
that
he
was
very
sensuous
gross
some
people
might
have
called
him
that
he
had
an
intense
possibly
an
undue
fondness
for
women
a
frivolous
childish
sense
of
humor
at
times
still
he
had
other
qualities
which
were
absolutely
adorable
life
seemed
positively
to
spring
up
in
him
one
felt
in
him
a
capacity
to
do
in
his
possibly
limited
field
an
ability
to
achieve
whether
he
was
doing
so
at
the
moment
or
not
and
a
supreme
willingness
to
share
and
radiate
his
success
qualities
exceedingly
rare
i
believe
some
people
are
so
successful
and
yet
you
know
their
success
is
purely
selfish
exclusive
not
inclusive
they
never
permit
you
to
share
in
their
lives
not
so
my
good
brother
he
was
generous
to
the
point
of
and
that
is
literally
true
he
was
the
mark
if
not
the
prey
of
all
those
who
desired
much
or
little
for
nothing
those
who
previously
might
not
have
rendered
him
a
service
of
any
kind
he
was
all
life
and
color
and
thousands
i
use
the
word
with
care
noted
and
commented
on
it
when
i
first
came
to
new
york
he
was
easily
the
foremost
popular
of
the
day
and
was
the
cause
of
my
coming
so
soon
at
least
having
established
himself
in
the
publishing
field
and
being
so
comfortably
settled
as
to
offer
me
a
kind
of
anchorage
in
so
troubled
a
commercial
sea
i
was
very
much
afraid
of
new
york
but
with
him
here
it
seemed
not
so
bad
the
firm
of
which
he
was
a
part
had
a
floor
or
two
in
an
old
residence
turned
office
building
as
so
many
are
in
new
york
in
twentieth
street
very
close
to
broadway
and
here
during
the
summer
months
when
the
various
theatrical
one
of
which
he
was
always
a
part
had
returned
for
the
closed
season
he
was
to
be
found
aiding
his
concern
in
the
reception
and
care
of
possible
applicants
for
songs
and
attracting
by
his
personality
such
virtuosi
of
the
vaudeville
and
comedy
stage
as
were
likely
to
make
the
instrumental
publications
of
his
firm
a
success
i
may
as
well
say
here
that
he
had
no
more
business
skill
than
a
fly
at
the
same
time
he
was
in
no
wise
sycophantic
where
either
wealth
power
or
fame
was
concerned
he
considered
himself
a
personage
of
sorts
and
was
the
minister
the
moralist
the
religionist
the
narrow
dogmatic
and
in
any
field
were
likely
to
be
the
butt
of
his
humor
and
he
could
imitate
so
many
phases
of
character
so
cleverly
that
he
was
the
life
of
any
idle
party
anywhere
to
this
day
i
recall
his
characterization
of
an
old
irish
washerwoman
arguing
a
stout
truculent
german
laying
down
the
law
lean
gloomy
actors
of
the
hamlet
or
classic
school
complaining
of
their
fate
the
stingy
skinflint
haggling
over
a
dollar
and
always
with
a
skill
for
titillating
the
risibilities
which
is
vivid
to
me
even
to
this
day
other
butts
of
his
humor
were
the
actor
the
irish
the
negro
and
the
hebrew
and
how
he
could
imitate
them
it
is
useless
to
try
to
indicate
such
things
in
writing
the
facial
expression
the
intonation
the
gestures
these
are
not
things
of
words
perhaps
i
can
best
indicate
the
direction
of
his
mind
if
not
his
manner
by
the
following
one
night
as
we
were
on
our
way
to
a
theater
there
stood
on
a
nearby
corner
in
the
cold
a
blind
man
singing
and
at
the
same
time
holding
out
a
little
tin
cup
into
which
the
coins
of
the
charitably
inclined
were
supposed
to
be
dropped
at
once
my
brother
noticed
him
for
he
had
an
eye
for
this
sort
of
thing
the
pathos
of
poverty
as
opposed
to
so
gay
a
scene
the
street
with
its
hurrying
theater
crowds
at
the
same
time
so
inherently
mischievous
was
his
nature
that
although
his
sympathy
for
the
suffering
or
the
of
fate
was
overwhelming
he
could
not
resist
combining
his
intended
charity
with
a
touch
of
the
ridiculous
got
any
pennies
he
demanded
three
or
four
going
over
to
an
outdoor
candystand
he
exchanged
a
quarter
for
pennies
then
came
back
and
waited
until
the
singer
who
had
ceased
singing
should
begin
a
new
melody
a
custom
of
the
singer
since
the
song
was
of
no
import
save
as
a
means
of
attracting
attention
to
him
was
to
interpolate
a
thank
you
after
each
coin
dropped
in
his
cup
and
between
the
words
of
the
song
regardless
it
was
this
little
idiosyncrasy
which
evidently
had
attracted
my
brother
attention
although
it
had
not
mine
standing
quite
close
his
pennies
in
his
hand
he
waited
until
the
singer
had
resumed
then
began
dropping
pennies
waiting
each
time
for
the
thank
you
which
caused
the
song
to
go
about
as
follows
clink
thank
you
i
am
clink
thank
you
growing
clink
thank
you
clink
thank
you
threads
among
the
clink
thank
you
clink
thank
you
shine
upon
clink
thank
you
clink
thank
you
life
is
clink
thank
you
fading
fast
clink
thank
you
and
so
on
ad
infinitum
until
finally
the
beggar
himself
seemed
to
hesitate
a
little
and
waver
only
so
solemn
was
his
rôle
of
want
and
despair
that
of
course
he
dared
not
but
had
to
go
on
until
the
last
penny
was
in
and
until
he
was
saying
more
thank
yous
than
words
of
the
song
a
noticing
it
had
begun
to
at
which
others
joined
in
myself
included
the
beggar
himself
a
rather
sniveling
specimen
finally
realizing
what
a
figure
he
was
cutting
with
his
song
and
thanks
emptied
the
coins
into
his
hand
and
with
an
indescribably
wry
expression
and
half
smile
exclaimed
i
have
to
thank
you
as
long
as
you
keep
putting
pennies
in
i
suppose
god
bless
you
my
brother
came
away
smiling
and
content
however
it
is
not
as
a
humorist
or
or
publisher
that
i
wish
to
portray
him
but
as
an
odd
lovable
personality
possessed
of
so
many
interesting
and
peculiar
and
almost
indescribable
traits
of
all
characters
in
fiction
he
perhaps
most
suggests
jack
falstaff
with
his
love
of
women
his
bravado
and
bluster
and
his
innate
good
nature
and
sympathy
sympathy
was
really
his
outstanding
characteristic
even
more
than
humor
although
the
latter
was
always
present
one
might
recite
a
thousand
incidents
of
his
generosity
and
charity
which
contained
no
least
thought
of
return
or
reward
i
recall
that
once
there
was
a
boy
who
had
been
reared
in
one
of
the
towns
in
which
we
had
once
lived
who
had
never
had
a
chance
in
his
youth
educationally
or
in
any
other
way
and
having
turned
out
bad
and
sunk
to
the
level
of
a
bank
robber
had
been
detected
in
connection
with
three
other
men
in
the
act
of
robbing
a
bank
the
watchman
of
which
was
subsequently
killed
in
the
mêlée
and
escape
of
all
four
criminals
only
this
one
had
been
caught
somewhere
in
prison
he
had
heard
sung
one
of
my
brother
sentimental
ballads
the
convict
and
the
bird
and
recollecting
that
he
had
known
paul
wrote
him
setting
forth
his
life
history
and
that
now
he
had
no
money
or
friends
at
once
my
good
brother
was
alive
to
the
pathos
of
it
he
showed
the
letter
to
me
and
wanted
to
know
what
could
be
done
i
suggested
a
lawyer
of
course
one
of
those
brilliant
legal
friends
of
his
always
he
had
enthusiastic
admirers
in
all
walks
who
might
take
the
case
for
little
or
nothing
there
was
the
leader
of
tammany
hall
richard
croker
who
could
be
reached
he
being
a
friend
of
paul
there
was
the
governor
himself
to
whom
a
plain
recitation
of
the
boy
unfortunate
life
might
be
addressed
and
with
some
hope
of
profit
all
of
these
things
he
did
and
more
he
went
to
the
prison
sing
sing
saw
the
warden
and
told
him
the
story
of
the
boy
life
then
went
to
the
boy
or
man
himself
and
gave
him
some
money
he
was
introduced
to
the
governor
through
influential
friends
and
permitted
to
tell
the
tale
there
was
much
delay
a
reprieve
a
commutation
of
the
death
penalty
to
life
imprisonment
the
best
that
could
be
done
but
he
was
so
grateful
for
that
so
pleased
you
would
have
thought
at
the
time
that
it
was
his
own
life
that
had
been
spared
good
heavens
i
jested
you
think
you
done
the
man
an
inestimable
service
getting
him
in
the
penitentiary
for
life
that
right
he
grinned
an
unbelievably
provoking
smile
better
be
dead
would
he
well
i
write
and
ask
him
which
rather
have
i
recall
again
taking
him
to
task
for
going
to
the
rescue
of
a
down
and
out
actor
who
had
been
highly
successful
and
apparently
not
very
sympathetic
in
his
day
one
of
that
more
or
less
gaudy
clan
that
wastes
its
substance
or
so
it
seemed
to
me
then
in
riotous
living
but
now
being
old
and
entirely
discarded
and
forgotten
he
was
in
need
of
sympathy
and
aid
by
some
chance
he
knew
paul
or
paul
had
known
him
and
now
because
of
the
former
obvious
prosperity
he
was
much
in
the
papers
at
the
time
he
had
appealed
to
him
the
man
lived
with
a
sister
in
a
wretched
little
town
far
out
on
long
island
on
receiving
his
appeal
paul
seemed
to
wish
to
investigate
for
himself
possibly
to
indulge
in
a
little
lofty
romance
or
sentiment
at
any
rate
he
wanted
me
to
go
along
for
the
sake
of
companionship
so
one
dreary
november
afternoon
we
went
saw
the
pantaloon
who
did
not
impress
me
very
much
even
in
his
age
and
misery
for
he
still
had
a
few
of
his
theatrical
manners
and
insincerities
and
as
we
were
coming
away
i
said
paul
why
should
you
be
the
goat
in
every
case
for
i
had
noted
ever
since
i
had
been
in
new
york
which
was
several
years
then
that
he
was
a
victim
of
many
such
importunities
if
it
was
not
the
widow
of
a
deceased
friend
who
needed
a
ton
of
coal
or
a
sack
of
flour
or
the
reckless
headstrong
boy
of
parents
too
poor
to
save
him
from
a
term
in
jail
or
the
reformatory
and
who
asked
for
or
an
appeal
to
higher
powers
for
clemency
or
a
wastrel
actor
or
actress
down
and
out
and
unable
to
get
back
to
new
york
and
requiring
his
or
her
railroad
fare
wired
prepaid
it
was
the
dead
wastrel
actor
or
actress
who
needed
a
coffin
and
a
decent
form
of
burial
well
you
know
how
it
is
thee
he
nearly
always
addressed
me
thus
when
you
old
and
sick
as
long
as
you
up
and
around
and
have
money
everybody
your
friend
but
once
you
down
and
out
no
one
wants
to
see
you
any
more
see
almost
amusingly
he
was
always
sad
over
those
who
had
once
been
prosperous
but
who
were
now
old
and
forgotten
some
of
his
silliest
tender
songs
conveyed
as
much
quite
so
i
complained
rather
brashly
i
suppose
but
why
did
he
save
a
little
money
when
he
had
it
he
made
as
much
as
you
ever
make
the
man
had
been
a
star
he
had
plenty
of
it
did
he
why
should
he
come
to
you
well
you
know
how
it
is
thee
he
explained
in
the
kindliest
and
most
apologetic
way
when
you
young
and
healthy
like
that
you
think
i
know
how
it
is
i
that
way
myself
we
all
have
a
little
of
it
in
us
i
have
you
have
and
anyhow
youth
the
time
to
spend
money
if
you
to
get
any
good
of
it
is
it
of
course
when
you
old
you
ca
expect
much
but
still
i
always
feel
as
though
i
like
to
help
some
of
these
old
people
his
eyes
at
such
times
always
seemed
more
like
those
of
a
mother
contemplating
a
sick
or
injured
child
than
those
of
a
man
contemplating
life
but
paul
i
insisted
on
another
occasion
when
he
had
just
wired
dollars
somewhere
to
help
bury
some
one
my
spirit
was
not
so
niggardly
as
fearsome
i
was
constantly
terrified
in
those
days
by
the
thought
of
a
old
age
for
myself
and
him
why
i
do
know
i
was
by
no
means
incompetent
why
do
you
save
your
money
why
should
you
give
it
to
every
tom
dick
and
harry
that
asks
you
you
not
a
charity
organization
and
you
not
called
upon
to
feed
and
clothe
and
bury
all
the
wasters
who
happen
to
cross
your
path
if
you
were
down
and
out
how
many
do
you
suppose
would
help
you
well
you
know
and
his
voice
and
manner
were
largely
those
of
mother
the
same
wonder
the
same
wistfulness
and
sweetness
the
same
bubbling
charity
and
tenderness
of
heart
i
ca
say
i
have
got
it
can
i
he
was
at
the
height
of
his
success
at
the
time
and
anyhow
what
the
use
being
so
hard
on
people
we
all
likely
to
get
that
way
you
know
what
pulls
people
down
sometimes
not
wasting
always
thoughtlessness
or
trying
to
be
happy
remember
how
poor
we
were
and
how
mamma
and
papa
used
to
worry
often
these
references
to
mother
or
father
or
their
difficulties
would
bring
tears
to
his
eyes
i
stand
to
see
people
suffer
that
all
not
if
i
have
anything
and
his
eyes
glowed
sweetly
and
after
all
he
added
apologetically
the
little
i
give
is
much
they
do
get
so
much
out
of
me
they
come
to
me
every
day
another
time
one
christmas
eve
it
was
when
i
was
comparatively
new
to
new
york
my
second
or
third
year
i
was
a
little
uncertain
what
to
do
having
no
connections
outside
of
paul
and
two
sisters
one
of
whom
was
then
out
of
the
city
the
other
owing
to
various
difficulties
of
her
own
and
a
temporary
estrangement
from
us
more
our
fault
than
hers
was
therefore
not
available
the
rather
drab
state
into
which
she
had
allowed
her
marital
affections
to
lead
her
was
the
main
reason
that
kept
us
apart
at
any
rate
i
felt
that
i
could
not
or
rather
would
not
go
there
at
the
same
time
owing
to
some
difficulty
or
irritation
with
the
publishing
house
of
which
my
brother
was
then
part
owner
it
was
publishing
the
magazine
which
i
was
editing
we
twain
were
also
estranged
nothing
very
deep
really
a
temporary
feeling
of
distance
and
indifference
so
i
had
no
place
to
go
except
to
my
room
which
was
in
a
poor
part
of
the
town
or
out
to
dine
where
best
i
might
some
hotel
was
my
thought
i
had
not
seen
my
brother
in
three
or
four
days
but
after
i
had
strolled
a
block
or
two
up
broadway
i
encountered
him
i
have
always
thought
that
he
had
kept
an
eye
on
me
and
had
really
followed
me
was
looking
in
short
to
see
what
i
would
do
as
usual
he
was
most
smartly
and
comfortably
dressed
where
you
going
thee
he
called
cheerfully
oh
no
place
in
particular
i
replied
rather
suavely
i
presume
just
going
up
the
street
now
see
here
sport
he
began
a
favorite
expression
of
his
sport
with
his
face
abeam
what
the
use
you
and
me
quarreling
it
christmas
eve
ai
it
it
a
shame
come
on
let
have
a
drink
and
then
go
out
to
dinner
well
i
said
rather
uncompromisingly
for
at
times
his
seemingly
extreme
success
and
irritated
me
i
have
a
drink
but
as
for
dinner
i
have
another
engagement
aw
do
say
that
what
the
use
being
sore
you
know
i
always
feel
the
same
even
if
we
do
quarrel
at
times
cut
it
out
come
on
you
know
i
your
brother
and
you
mine
it
all
right
with
me
thee
make
it
up
will
you
put
there
come
on
now
we
go
and
have
a
drink
see
something
hot
it
christmas
eve
sport
the
old
home
stuff
he
smiled
winsomely
coaxingly
really
tenderly
as
only
he
could
smile
i
gave
in
but
now
as
we
entered
the
nearest
shining
bar
a
christmas
crowd
buzzing
within
and
without
it
was
the
old
fifth
avenue
hotel
a
new
thought
seemed
to
strike
him
seen
e
lately
he
inquired
mentioning
the
name
of
the
troubled
sister
who
was
having
a
very
hard
time
indeed
her
husband
had
left
her
and
she
was
struggling
over
the
care
of
two
children
no
i
replied
rather
shamefacedly
not
in
a
week
or
two
maybe
more
he
clicked
his
tongue
he
himself
had
not
been
near
her
in
a
month
or
more
his
face
fell
and
he
looked
very
depressed
it
too
bad
a
shame
really
we
ought
to
do
this
way
you
know
sport
it
ai
right
what
do
you
say
to
our
going
around
there
it
was
in
the
upper
thirties
and
see
how
she
making
out
take
her
a
few
things
eh
whaddya
say
i
had
a
spare
dollar
myself
but
i
knew
well
enough
what
he
meant
by
take
a
few
things
and
who
would
pay
for
them
well
we
have
to
hurry
if
we
want
to
get
anything
now
i
urged
falling
in
with
the
idea
since
it
promised
peace
plenty
and
good
will
all
around
and
we
rushed
the
drink
and
departed
near
at
hand
was
a
branch
of
one
of
the
greatest
grocery
companies
of
the
city
and
near
it
too
his
then
favorite
hotel
the
continental
en
route
we
meditated
on
the
impossibility
of
delivery
the
fact
that
we
would
have
to
carry
the
things
ourselves
but
he
at
last
solved
that
by
declaring
that
he
could
commandeer
negro
porters
or
bootblacks
from
the
continental
we
entered
and
by
sheer
smiles
on
his
part
and
some
blarney
heaped
upon
a
secured
a
turkey
sweet
potatoes
peas
beans
a
salad
a
strip
of
bacon
a
ham
plum
pudding
a
basket
of
luscious
fruit
and
i
know
not
what
else
provender
i
am
sure
for
a
dozen
meals
while
it
was
being
wrapped
and
packed
in
borrowed
baskets
soon
to
be
returned
he
went
across
the
way
to
the
hotel
and
came
back
with
three
grinning
darkies
who
for
the
tip
they
knew
they
would
receive
preceded
us
up
broadway
the
nearest
path
to
our
destination
on
the
way
a
few
additional
things
were
picked
up
holly
wreaths
toys
candy
nuts
and
then
really
not
knowing
whether
our
plan
might
not
we
made
our
way
through
the
side
street
and
to
the
particular
apartment
or
rather
door
a
most
amusing
christmas
procession
i
fancy
wondering
and
worrying
now
whether
she
would
be
there
but
the
door
clicked
in
answer
to
our
ring
and
up
we
marched
the
three
darkies
first
instructed
to
inquire
for
her
and
then
insist
on
leaving
the
goods
while
we
lagged
behind
to
see
how
she
would
take
it
the
stage
arrangement
worked
as
planned
my
sister
opened
the
door
and
from
the
steps
below
we
could
hear
her
protesting
that
she
had
ordered
nothing
but
the
door
being
open
the
negroes
walked
in
and
a
moment
or
two
afterwards
ourselves
the
packages
were
being
piled
on
table
and
floor
while
my
sister
unable
quite
to
grasp
this
sudden
visitation
and
change
of
heart
stared
just
thought
we
come
around
and
have
supper
with
you
e
and
maybe
dinner
tomorrow
if
you
let
us
my
brother
chortled
merry
christmas
you
know
christmas
eve
the
good
old
home
stuff
see
old
sport
here
and
i
thought
we
could
stay
away
tonight
anyhow
he
beamed
on
her
in
his
most
affectionate
way
but
she
suffering
regret
over
the
recent
estrangement
as
well
as
the
difficulties
of
life
itself
and
the
joy
of
this
reunion
burst
into
tears
while
the
two
little
ones
danced
about
and
he
and
i
put
our
arms
about
her
there
there
it
all
over
now
he
declared
tears
welling
in
his
eyes
it
all
off
we
can
this
scrapping
stuff
thee
and
i
are
a
couple
of
bums
and
we
know
it
but
you
can
forgive
us
ca
you
we
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
ourselves
all
of
us
and
that
the
truth
been
quarreling
too
have
spoken
for
a
week
ai
that
so
sport
but
it
all
right
now
eh
there
were
tears
in
my
eyes
too
one
could
resist
him
he
had
the
power
of
achieving
the
tenderest
results
in
the
simplest
ways
we
then
had
supper
and
breakfast
the
next
morning
all
staying
and
helping
even
to
the
washing
and
drying
of
the
dishes
and
thereafter
for
i
know
how
long
we
were
all
on
the
most
affectionate
terms
and
he
eventually
died
in
this
sister
home
ministered
to
with
absolutely
restless
devotion
by
her
for
weeks
before
the
end
finally
came
but
as
i
have
said
i
always
prefer
to
think
of
him
at
this
the
very
apex
or
tower
window
of
his
life
for
most
of
this
period
he
was
gay
and
carefree
the
music
company
of
which
he
was
a
third
owner
was
at
the
very
top
of
its
success
its
songs
as
well
as
his
were
everywhere
he
had
in
turn
at
this
time
a
suite
at
the
gilsey
house
the
marlborough
the
normandie
always
on
broadway
you
see
the
limelight
district
was
his
home
he
rose
in
the
morning
to
the
clang
of
the
cars
and
the
honk
of
the
automobiles
outside
he
retired
at
night
as
a
gang
of
repair
men
under
flaring
torches
might
be
repairing
a
track
or
the
milk
trucks
were
rumbling
to
and
from
the
ferries
he
was
in
his
way
a
public
restaurant
and
hotel
favorite
a
shining
light
in
the
theater
offices
hotel
bars
and
lobbies
and
wherever
those
flies
of
the
tenderloin
those
passing
lords
and
celebrities
of
the
sporting
theatrical
newspaper
and
other
worlds
are
wont
to
gather
one
of
his
intimates
as
i
now
recall
was
bat
masterson
the
western
and
now
retired
to
broadway
bad
man
muldoon
the
famous
wrestler
tod
sloan
the
jockey
battling
nelson
james
corbett
kid
mccoy
terry
mcgovern
all
such
tammany
district
leaders
as
james
murphy
the
mcmanus
chrystie
and
timothy
sullivan
richard
carroll
and
even
richard
croker
the
then
reigning
tammany
boss
were
all
on
his
visiting
list
he
went
to
their
meetings
rallies
and
district
doings
generally
to
sing
and
play
and
they
came
to
his
office
occasionally
various
high
and
mighties
of
the
roman
church
fathers
with
fine
parishes
and
good
wine
cellars
and
judges
of
various
municipal
courts
were
also
of
his
peculiar
world
he
was
always
running
to
one
or
the
other
to
get
somebody
out
or
they
to
him
to
get
him
to
contribute
something
to
something
or
to
sing
and
play
or
act
and
betimes
they
were
meeting
each
other
in
hotel
grills
or
elsewhere
and
having
a
drink
and
telling
funny
stories
apropos
of
this
sense
of
humor
of
his
this
love
of
almost
i
remember
that
once
he
had
a
new
story
to
tell
a
vulgar
one
of
course
and
with
it
he
had
been
making
me
and
a
dozen
others
laugh
until
the
tears
coursed
down
our
cheeks
it
seemed
new
to
everybody
and
true
to
his
rather
fantastic
moods
he
was
determined
to
be
the
first
to
tell
it
along
broadway
for
some
reason
he
was
anxious
to
have
me
go
along
with
him
possibly
because
he
found
me
at
that
time
an
unvarying
fountain
of
approval
and
laughter
possibly
because
he
liked
to
show
me
off
as
his
rising
brother
as
he
insisted
that
i
was
at
between
six
and
seven
of
a
spring
or
summer
evening
therefore
we
issued
from
his
suite
at
the
gilsey
house
whither
he
had
returned
to
dress
and
invading
the
bar
below
were
at
once
centered
among
a
group
who
knew
him
a
whiskey
a
cigar
the
story
told
to
one
two
three
five
ten
to
roars
of
laughter
and
we
were
off
over
the
way
to
weber
fields
the
musical
burlesque
house
supreme
of
those
days
in
the
same
block
where
to
the
ticket
seller
and
house
manager
both
of
whom
he
knew
it
was
told
more
laughter
a
cigar
perhaps
then
we
were
off
again
this
time
to
the
ticket
seller
of
palmer
theater
at
thirtieth
street
thence
to
the
bar
of
the
grand
hotel
at
the
imperial
at
the
martinique
at
a
famous
at
the
southwest
corner
of
and
broadway
now
gone
of
course
the
manager
of
which
was
a
friend
of
his
it
was
a
warm
moony
night
and
he
took
a
glass
of
vichy
for
looks
sake
as
he
said
then
to
the
quondam
hotel
aulic
at
and
broadway
the
center
and
home
of
the
then
hotel
aulic
or
actors
school
of
philosophy
and
a
most
impressive
actors
rendezvous
where
might
have
been
seen
in
the
course
of
an
evening
all
the
second
leads
and
light
comedians
and
heavies
of
this
that
and
the
other
road
company
all
blazing
with
startling
clothes
and
all
explaining
how
they
knocked
here
and
there
in
peoria
pasadena
and
where
not
my
brother
shone
like
a
star
when
only
one
is
in
the
sky
over
the
way
then
to
the
herald
building
its
owls
eyes
glowing
in
the
night
its
presses
thundering
the
elevated
thundering
beside
it
here
was
a
business
manager
whom
he
knew
then
to
the
herald
square
theater
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
ablaze
with
a
small
electric
sign
among
the
newest
in
the
city
in
this
as
in
the
business
office
of
the
was
another
manager
and
he
knew
them
all
thence
to
the
marlborough
bar
and
lobby
at
the
manager
office
of
the
knickerbocker
theater
at
stopping
at
the
bar
and
lobby
of
the
normandie
where
some
blazing
professional
beauty
of
the
stage
waylaid
him
and
exchanged
theatrical
witticisms
with
him
and
what
else
thence
to
the
manager
office
of
the
casino
at
some
bar
which
was
across
the
street
another
in
west
of
broadway
an
italian
restaurant
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
metropolitan
at
fortieth
and
broadway
and
at
last
but
by
no
means
least
and
by
such
slow
stages
to
the
very
door
of
the
then
mecca
of
meccas
of
all
and
sportdom
the
sanctum
sanctorum
of
all
those
sportively
au
fait
wise
the
real
thing
the
hotel
metropole
at
broadway
and
street
the
then
extreme
northern
limit
of
the
district
and
what
a
realm
rounders
and
what
not
were
here
ensconced
at
round
tables
their
backs
against
the
wall
seats
the
adjoining
windows
open
to
all
broadway
and
the
then
all
but
somber
street
it
was
wonderful
the
loud
clothes
the
bright
straw
hats
the
canes
the
diamonds
the
hot
socks
the
air
of
security
and
so
easily
assumed
by
those
who
gain
an
all
too
brief
hour
in
this
pretty
petty
world
of
and
pleasure
and
among
them
my
dearest
brother
was
at
his
best
it
was
paul
here
and
paul
there
why
hello
dresser
you
just
in
time
come
on
in
you
have
let
me
tell
you
something
paul
a
good
one
more
drinks
cigars
tales
magnificent
tales
of
successes
made
great
shows
given
fights
deaths
marvelous
winnings
at
cards
trickeries
in
racing
the
dogs
that
some
people
were
the
magnificent
magnanimous
god
own
salt
that
others
were
the
oaths
stories
of
women
what
low
ghoulas
certain
reigning
beauties
of
the
town
or
stage
were
and
so
on
and
so
on
ad
infinitum
but
his
story
ah
yes
i
had
all
but
forgotten
it
was
told
in
every
place
not
once
but
seven
eight
nine
ten
times
we
did
not
eat
until
we
reached
the
metropole
and
it
was
when
we
reached
it
the
handshakes
the
road
stories
this
is
my
brother
theodore
he
writes
he
a
newspaper
man
the
roars
of
laughter
the
drinks
ah
my
boy
that
good
but
let
me
tell
you
one
one
that
i
heard
out
in
louisville
the
other
day
a
seedy
shabby
of
a
maybe
stopping
the
successful
author
in
the
midst
of
a
tale
to
borrow
a
dollar
another
actor
shabby
and
distrait
reciting
the
sad
tale
of
a
year
misfortunes
everywhere
my
dear
brother
was
called
to
slapped
on
the
back
chuckled
with
he
was
successful
one
of
his
best
songs
was
the
rage
he
had
an
interest
in
a
going
musical
concern
he
could
confer
benefits
favors
ah
me
ah
me
that
one
could
be
so
great
and
that
it
should
not
last
for
ever
and
for
ever
another
of
his
outstanding
characteristics
was
his
love
of
women
a
really
amusing
and
at
times
ridiculous
quality
he
was
always
sighing
over
the
beauty
innocence
sweetness
this
and
that
of
young
maidenhood
in
his
songs
but
in
real
life
he
seemed
to
desire
and
attract
quite
a
different
type
the
young
and
beautiful
it
is
true
but
also
the
old
the
homely
and
the
somewhat
savage
a
catholicity
of
taste
i
could
never
quite
stomach
it
was
paul
dearest
here
and
paul
dearest
there
especially
in
his
work
in
connection
with
the
and
the
stage
in
the
former
popular
ballad
singers
of
both
sexes
some
of
the
women
most
attractive
and
willful
were
most
numerous
coming
in
daily
from
all
parts
of
the
world
apparently
to
find
songs
which
they
could
sing
on
the
american
or
even
the
english
stage
and
it
was
a
part
of
his
duty
as
a
member
of
the
firm
and
the
one
who
principally
handled
the
professional
inquirers
to
meet
them
and
see
that
they
were
shown
what
the
catalogue
contained
occasionally
there
was
an
aspiring
female
often
mere
women
visitors
regardless
however
of
whether
they
were
young
old
attractive
or
repulsive
male
or
female
i
never
knew
any
one
whose
manner
was
more
uniformly
winsome
or
who
seemed
so
easily
to
disarm
or
relax
an
indifferent
or
irritated
mood
he
was
positive
sunshine
the
same
in
quality
as
that
of
a
bright
spring
morning
his
blue
eyes
focused
mellowly
his
lips
were
tendrilled
with
smiles
he
had
a
brisk
quick
manner
always
somehow
suggestive
of
my
mother
who
was
never
brisk
and
how
he
fascinated
them
the
women
their
quite
shameless
daring
where
he
was
concerned
positively
in
the
face
of
it
i
used
to
wonder
what
had
become
of
all
the
vaunted
and
stabilizing
morality
of
the
world
none
of
it
seemed
to
be
in
the
possession
of
these
women
especially
the
young
and
beautiful
they
were
distant
and
freezing
enough
to
all
who
did
not
interest
them
but
let
a
personality
such
as
his
come
into
view
and
they
were
all
wiles
bending
and
alluring
graces
it
was
so
obvious
this
fascination
he
had
for
them
and
they
for
him
that
at
times
it
took
on
a
comic
look
get
onto
the
hit
he
making
one
would
nudge
another
and
remark
say
some
tenderness
that
this
in
reference
to
a
smile
or
a
melting
glance
on
the
part
of
a
female
nothing
like
a
way
with
the
ladies
some
baby
eh
boys
this
following
the
flick
of
a
skirt
and
a
glance
perhaps
as
some
noticeable
beauty
passed
out
no
wonder
he
cheerful
a
sour
and
yet
philosophic
vaudevillian
who
was
mostly
out
of
a
job
and
hung
about
the
place
for
what
free
meals
he
could
obtain
once
remarked
to
me
in
a
heavy
and
morose
undertone
if
i
had
that
many
women
crazy
about
me
i
be
too
and
the
results
of
these
encounters
with
beauty
always
he
had
something
most
important
to
attend
to
morning
noon
or
night
and
whenever
i
encountered
him
after
some
such
statement
the
important
thing
was
of
course
a
woman
as
time
went
on
and
he
began
to
look
upon
me
as
something
more
than
a
thin
spindling
dyspeptic
and
disgruntled
youth
he
began
to
wish
to
introduce
me
to
some
of
his
marvelous
followers
and
then
i
could
see
how
completely
dependent
upon
beauty
in
the
flesh
he
was
how
it
made
his
life
and
world
one
day
as
we
were
all
sitting
in
the
office
a
large
group
of
vaudevillians
singers
a
chance
remark
gave
rise
to
a
subsequent
practical
joke
at
paul
expense
i
bet
observed
some
one
that
if
a
strange
man
were
to
rush
in
here
with
a
revolver
and
say
the
man
that
seduced
my
wife
paul
would
be
the
first
to
duck
he
would
wait
to
find
out
whether
he
was
the
one
meant
or
not
much
laughter
followed
and
some
thought
the
subject
of
this
banter
was
of
course
not
present
at
the
time
there
was
one
actor
who
hung
about
there
who
was
decidedly
skillful
in
on
more
than
one
occasion
he
had
disguised
himself
there
in
the
office
for
our
benefit
coöperating
with
us
he
disguised
himself
now
as
a
very
severe
and
even
person
of
about
mustachios
and
goatee
then
with
our
aid
timing
his
arrival
to
an
hour
when
paul
was
certain
to
be
at
his
desk
he
entered
briskly
and
vigorously
and
looking
about
with
a
savage
air
demanded
where
is
paul
dresser
the
latter
turned
almost
apprehensively
i
thought
and
at
once
seemed
by
no
means
captivated
by
the
man
looks
that
dresser
there
explained
one
of
the
confederates
most
willingly
the
stranger
turned
and
glared
at
him
so
you
the
scoundrel
been
running
around
with
my
wife
are
you
he
demanded
approaching
him
and
placing
one
hand
on
his
right
hip
paul
made
no
effort
to
explain
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
deny
the
allegation
although
he
had
never
seen
the
man
before
with
a
rising
and
backward
movement
he
fell
against
the
rail
behind
him
lifting
both
hands
in
fright
and
exclaiming
why
why
do
shoot
his
expression
was
one
of
guilt
astonishment
perplexity
as
some
one
afterwards
said
as
puzzled
as
if
he
was
trying
to
discover
which
injured
husband
it
might
be
the
shout
that
went
up
for
it
was
agreed
beforehand
that
the
joke
must
not
be
carried
far
convinced
him
that
a
hoax
had
been
perpetrated
and
the
removal
by
the
actor
of
his
hat
sideburns
and
mustache
revealed
the
true
character
of
the
injured
husband
at
first
inclined
to
be
angry
and
sulky
later
on
he
saw
the
humor
of
his
own
indefinite
position
in
the
matter
and
laughed
as
heartily
as
any
but
i
fancy
it
developed
a
strain
of
uncertainty
in
him
also
in
regard
to
injured
husbands
for
he
was
never
afterwards
inclined
to
interest
himself
in
the
and
gave
such
wives
a
wide
berth
but
his
great
forte
was
of
course
his
and
of
this
before
i
speak
of
anything
else
i
wish
to
have
my
say
it
was
a
gift
quite
a
compelling
one
out
of
which
before
he
died
he
had
made
thousands
all
spent
in
the
manner
described
never
having
the
least
power
to
interpret
anything
in
a
fine
musical
way
still
he
was
always
full
of
music
of
a
tender
sometimes
sad
sometimes
gay
kind
that
of
the
of
a
nation
he
was
constantly
attempting
to
work
them
out
of
himself
not
quickly
but
slowly
brooding
as
it
were
over
the
piano
wherever
he
might
find
one
and
could
have
a
little
solitude
at
times
on
the
organ
his
favorite
instrument
improvising
various
sad
or
wistful
strains
some
of
which
he
jotted
down
others
of
which
having
mastered
he
strove
to
fit
words
to
at
such
times
he
preferred
to
be
alone
or
with
some
one
whose
temperament
in
no
way
clashed
but
rather
harmonized
with
his
own
living
with
one
of
my
sisters
for
a
period
of
years
he
had
a
room
specially
fitted
up
for
his
composing
work
a
very
small
room
for
so
very
large
a
man
within
which
he
would
shut
himself
and
thrum
a
melody
by
the
hour
especially
toward
evening
or
at
night
he
seemed
to
have
a
peculiar
fondness
for
the
twilight
hour
and
at
this
time
might
thrum
over
one
strain
and
another
until
over
some
particular
one
a
new
song
usually
he
would
be
in
tears
and
what
pale
little
things
they
were
really
mere
bits
and
scraps
of
sentiment
and
melodrama
in
story
form
most
asinine
sighings
over
home
and
mother
and
lost
sweethearts
and
dead
heroes
such
as
never
were
in
real
life
and
yet
with
something
about
them
in
the
music
at
least
which
always
appealed
to
me
intensely
and
must
have
appealed
to
others
since
they
attained
so
wide
a
circulation
they
bespoke
as
i
always
felt
a
wistful
seeking
uncertain
temperament
tender
and
illusioned
with
no
practical
knowledge
of
any
side
of
life
but
full
of
a
true
poetic
feeling
for
the
mystery
and
pathos
of
life
and
death
the
wonder
of
the
waters
the
stars
the
flowers
accidents
of
life
success
failure
beginning
with
a
song
called
wide
wings
published
by
a
small
retail
in
evansville
indiana
and
followed
by
such
national
successes
as
the
letter
that
never
came
i
believe
it
for
my
mother
told
me
so
the
convict
and
the
bird
the
pardon
came
too
late
just
tell
them
that
you
saw
me
the
blue
and
the
grey
on
the
bowery
on
the
banks
of
the
wabash
and
a
number
of
others
he
was
never
content
to
rest
and
never
really
happy
i
think
save
when
composing
during
this
time
however
he
was
at
different
periods
all
the
things
i
have
described
a
monologue
artist
an
and
at
times
a
a
publisher
and
so
on
i
recall
being
with
him
at
the
time
he
composed
two
of
his
most
famous
successes
just
tell
them
that
you
saw
me
and
on
the
banks
of
the
wabash
and
noting
his
peculiar
mood
almost
amounting
to
a
deep
depression
which
ended
a
little
later
in
marked
elation
or
satisfaction
once
he
had
succeeded
in
evoking
something
which
really
pleased
him
the
first
of
these
songs
must
have
followed
an
actual
encounter
with
some
woman
or
girl
whose
life
had
seemingly
if
not
actually
gone
to
wreck
on
the
shore
of
love
or
passion
at
any
rate
he
came
into
the
office
of
his
publishing
house
one
gray
november
sunday
afternoon
it
was
our
custom
to
go
there
occasionally
a
dozen
or
more
congenial
souls
about
as
one
might
go
to
a
club
and
going
into
a
small
room
which
was
fitted
up
with
a
piano
as
a
room
professionals
desiring
a
song
were
frequently
taught
it
in
the
office
he
began
improvising
or
rather
repeating
over
and
over
a
certain
strain
which
was
evidently
in
his
mind
a
little
while
later
he
came
out
and
said
listen
to
this
will
you
thee
he
played
and
sang
the
first
verse
and
chorus
in
the
middle
of
the
latter
so
moved
was
he
by
the
sentiment
of
it
his
voice
broke
and
he
had
to
stop
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
and
he
wiped
them
away
a
moment
or
two
later
he
was
able
to
go
through
it
without
wavering
and
i
thought
it
charming
for
the
type
of
thing
it
was
intended
to
be
later
on
the
following
spring
i
was
literally
astonished
to
see
how
after
those
various
efforts
usually
made
by
popular
music
publishers
to
make
a
song
go
advertising
it
in
the
and
getting
various
vaudeville
singers
to
sing
it
and
so
forth
it
suddenly
began
to
sell
thousands
upon
thousands
of
copies
being
wrapped
in
great
bundles
under
my
very
eyes
and
shipped
express
or
freight
to
various
parts
of
the
country
letters
and
telegrams
even
from
all
parts
of
the
nation
began
to
pour
in
forward
express
today
copies
of
dresser
them
that
you
saw
me
the
firm
was
at
once
as
busy
as
a
on
easy
street
again
as
the
expression
went
in
clover
just
before
this
there
had
been
a
slight
slump
in
its
business
and
in
my
finances
but
now
once
more
he
was
his
most
engaging
self
every
one
in
that
layer
of
life
which
understands
or
takes
an
interest
in
popular
songs
and
their
creators
knew
of
him
and
his
song
his
latest
success
he
was
as
it
were
a
revivified
figure
on
broadway
his
barbers
barkeepers
hotel
clerks
theatrical
clerks
hotel
managers
and
the
stars
and
singers
of
the
street
knew
of
it
and
him
some
enterprising
button
firm
got
out
a
button
on
which
the
phrase
was
printed
comedians
on
the
stage
newspaper
paragraphers
his
bank
teller
or
his
tailor
even
staid
business
men
wishing
to
appear
used
it
as
a
parting
salute
the
the
bands
and
the
theater
orchestras
everywhere
were
using
it
one
could
scarcely
turn
a
corner
or
go
into
a
cheap
music
hall
or
variety
house
without
hearing
a
parody
of
it
it
was
wonderful
the
enormous
furore
that
it
seemed
to
create
and
of
course
my
dear
brother
was
privileged
to
walk
about
smiling
and
secure
his
bank
account
large
his
friends
numerous
in
the
pink
of
health
and
gloating
over
the
fact
that
he
was
a
success
well
known
a
genuine
creator
of
popular
songs
it
was
the
same
with
on
the
banks
of
the
wabash
possibly
an
even
greater
success
for
it
came
eventually
to
be
adopted
by
his
native
state
as
its
state
song
and
in
that
region
streets
and
a
town
were
named
after
him
in
an
almost
unintentional
and
unthinking
way
i
had
a
hand
in
that
and
it
has
always
cheered
me
to
think
that
i
had
although
i
have
never
had
the
least
talent
for
musical
composition
or
song
versification
it
was
one
of
those
delightful
summer
sunday
mornings
i
believe
when
i
was
still
connected
with
his
firm
as
editor
of
the
little
monthly
they
were
issuing
and
he
and
myself
living
with
my
sister
e
that
we
had
gone
over
to
this
office
to
do
a
little
work
i
had
a
number
of
current
magazines
i
wished
to
examine
he
was
always
wishing
to
compose
something
to
express
that
ebullient
and
emotional
soul
of
his
in
some
way
what
do
you
suppose
would
make
a
good
song
these
days
he
asked
in
an
idle
meditative
mood
sitting
at
the
piano
and
thrumming
while
i
at
a
nearby
table
was
looking
over
my
papers
why
do
you
give
me
an
idea
for
one
once
in
a
while
sport
you
ought
to
be
able
to
suggest
something
me
i
queried
almost
contemptuously
i
suppose
i
could
be
very
lofty
at
times
in
regard
to
his
work
much
as
i
admired
him
vain
and
yet
more
or
less
dependent
snip
that
i
was
i
ca
write
those
things
why
do
you
write
something
about
a
state
or
a
river
look
at
old
kentucky
home
black
joe
why
do
you
do
something
like
that
something
that
suggests
a
part
of
america
people
like
that
take
indiana
what
the
matter
with
it
the
wabash
river
it
as
good
as
any
other
river
and
you
were
beside
it
i
have
to
smile
even
now
as
i
recall
the
apparent
zest
or
feeling
with
which
all
at
once
he
seized
on
this
it
seemed
to
appeal
to
him
immensely
that
not
a
bad
idea
he
agreed
but
how
would
you
go
about
it
why
do
you
write
the
words
and
let
me
put
the
music
to
them
we
do
it
together
but
i
ca
i
replied
i
do
know
how
to
do
those
things
you
write
it
i
help
maybe
after
a
little
urging
i
think
the
fineness
of
the
morning
had
as
much
to
do
with
it
as
anything
i
took
a
piece
of
paper
and
after
meditating
a
while
scribbled
in
the
most
tentative
manner
imaginable
the
first
verse
and
chorus
of
that
song
almost
as
it
was
published
i
think
one
or
two
lines
were
too
long
or
did
rhyme
but
eventually
either
he
or
i
hammered
them
into
shape
but
before
that
i
rather
shamefacedly
turned
them
over
to
him
for
somehow
i
was
convinced
that
this
work
was
not
for
me
and
that
i
was
rather
loftily
and
cynically
attempting
what
my
good
brother
would
do
in
all
faith
and
feeling
he
read
it
insisted
that
it
was
fine
and
that
i
should
do
a
second
verse
something
with
a
story
in
it
a
girl
perhaps
a
task
which
i
solemnly
rejected
no
you
put
it
in
it
yours
i
through
some
time
later
disagreeing
with
the
firm
as
to
the
conduct
of
the
magazine
i
left
really
was
forced
out
which
raised
a
little
feeling
on
my
part
not
on
his
i
am
sure
for
i
was
very
difficult
to
deal
with
time
passed
and
i
heard
nothing
i
had
been
able
to
succeed
in
a
somewhat
different
realm
that
of
the
magazine
contributor
and
although
i
thought
a
great
deal
of
my
brother
i
paid
very
little
attention
to
him
or
his
affairs
being
much
more
concerned
with
my
own
one
spring
night
however
the
following
year
as
i
was
lying
in
my
bed
trying
to
sleep
i
heard
a
quartette
of
boys
in
the
distance
approaching
along
the
street
in
which
i
had
my
room
i
could
not
make
out
the
words
at
first
but
the
melody
at
once
attracted
my
attention
it
was
plaintive
and
compelling
i
listened
attracted
satisfied
that
it
was
some
new
popular
success
that
had
caught
on
as
they
drew
near
my
window
i
heard
the
words
on
the
banks
of
the
wabash
most
mellifluously
harmonized
i
jumped
up
they
were
my
words
it
was
paul
song
he
had
another
hit
then
on
the
banks
of
the
wabash
and
they
were
singing
it
in
the
streets
already
i
leaned
out
of
the
window
and
listened
as
they
approached
and
passed
on
their
arms
about
each
other
shoulders
the
whole
song
being
sung
in
the
still
street
as
it
were
for
my
benefit
the
night
was
so
warm
delicious
a
full
moon
was
overhead
i
was
young
lonely
wistful
it
brought
back
so
much
of
my
already
spent
youth
that
i
was
ready
to
cry
for
joy
principally
in
three
more
months
it
was
everywhere
in
the
papers
on
the
stage
on
the
played
by
orchestras
bands
whistled
and
sung
in
the
streets
one
day
on
broadway
near
the
marlborough
i
met
my
brother
cane
silk
shirt
a
smart
summer
suit
a
gay
straw
hat
ah
i
said
rather
sarcastically
for
i
still
felt
peeved
that
he
had
shown
so
little
interest
in
my
affairs
at
the
time
i
was
leaving
on
the
banks
i
see
on
the
banks
he
replied
cordially
you
turned
the
trick
for
me
thee
that
time
what
are
you
doing
now
why
do
you
ever
come
and
see
me
i
still
your
brother
you
know
a
part
of
that
is
really
yours
cut
that
i
replied
most
savagely
i
could
write
a
song
like
that
in
a
million
years
you
know
i
could
the
words
are
nothing
oh
all
right
it
true
though
you
know
where
do
you
keep
yourself
why
do
you
come
and
see
me
why
be
down
on
me
i
live
here
you
know
he
looked
up
at
the
then
brisk
and
successful
hotel
well
maybe
i
will
some
time
i
said
distantly
but
with
no
particular
desire
to
mend
matters
and
we
parted
there
was
however
several
years
later
a
sequel
to
all
this
and
one
so
characteristic
of
him
that
it
has
always
remained
in
my
mind
as
one
of
the
really
beautiful
things
of
life
and
i
might
as
well
tell
it
here
and
now
about
five
years
later
i
had
become
so
disappointed
in
connection
with
my
work
and
the
unfriendly
pressure
of
life
that
i
had
suffered
what
subsequently
appeared
to
have
been
a
purely
psychic
breakdown
or
relapse
not
physical
but
one
which
left
me
in
no
mood
or
condition
to
go
on
with
my
work
or
any
work
indeed
in
any
form
hope
had
disappeared
in
a
sad
haze
i
could
apparently
succeed
in
nothing
do
nothing
mentally
that
was
worth
while
at
the
same
time
i
had
all
but
retired
from
the
world
living
on
less
and
less
until
finally
i
had
descended
into
those
depths
where
i
was
in
the
grip
of
actual
want
with
no
place
to
which
my
pride
would
let
me
turn
i
had
always
been
too
vain
and
apparently
there
was
but
one
door
and
i
was
very
close
to
it
to
match
my
purse
i
had
retired
to
a
still
sorrier
neighborhood
in
b
one
of
the
poorest
i
desired
most
of
all
to
be
let
alone
to
be
to
myself
still
i
could
not
be
for
occasionally
i
met
people
and
certain
prospects
and
necessities
drove
me
to
various
publishing
houses
one
day
as
i
was
walking
in
some
street
near
broadway
not
on
it
in
new
york
i
ran
into
my
brother
quite
by
accident
he
as
prosperous
and
comfortable
as
ever
i
think
i
resented
him
more
than
ever
he
was
of
course
astonished
shocked
as
i
could
plainly
see
by
my
appearance
and
desire
not
to
be
seen
he
demanded
to
know
where
i
was
living
wanted
me
to
come
then
and
there
and
stay
with
him
wanted
me
to
tell
him
what
the
trouble
was
all
of
which
i
rather
stubbornly
refused
to
do
and
finally
got
away
not
however
without
giving
him
my
address
though
with
the
caution
that
i
wanted
nothing
the
next
morning
he
was
there
bright
and
early
in
a
cab
he
was
the
most
vehement
the
most
tender
the
most
disturbed
creature
i
have
ever
seen
he
was
like
a
distrait
mother
with
a
sick
child
more
than
anything
else
for
god
sake
he
commented
when
he
saw
me
living
in
a
place
like
this
and
at
this
number
too
it
was
and
he
was
superstitious
as
to
the
thirteen
i
knew
there
be
a
damned
thirteen
in
it
he
ejaculated
and
me
over
in
new
york
jesus
christ
and
you
sick
and
run
down
this
way
i
might
have
known
it
just
like
you
i
have
heard
a
thing
about
you
in
i
do
know
when
well
i
not
going
back
without
you
that
all
you
got
to
come
with
me
now
see
get
your
clothes
that
all
the
cabby
take
your
trunk
i
know
just
the
place
for
you
and
you
going
there
tomorrow
or
next
day
or
next
week
but
coming
with
me
now
my
god
i
should
think
you
be
ashamed
of
yourself
and
me
feeling
the
way
i
do
about
you
his
eyes
all
but
brimmed
i
was
so
morose
and
despondent
that
grateful
as
i
felt
i
could
scarcely
take
his
mood
at
its
value
i
resented
it
resented
myself
my
state
life
i
ca
i
said
finally
or
so
i
thought
i
wo
i
do
need
your
help
you
do
owe
me
anything
you
done
enough
already
owe
hell
he
retorted
who
talking
about
and
you
my
brother
my
own
flesh
and
blood
why
thee
for
that
matter
i
owe
you
half
of
the
banks
and
you
know
it
you
ca
go
on
living
like
this
you
sick
and
discouraged
you
ca
fool
me
why
thee
a
big
man
you
just
got
to
come
out
of
this
damn
it
do
you
see
do
make
me
and
he
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
wiped
his
eyes
you
ca
help
yourself
now
but
you
can
later
do
you
see
come
on
get
your
things
i
never
forgive
myself
if
i
did
got
to
come
that
all
i
wo
go
without
you
and
he
began
looking
about
for
my
bag
and
trunk
i
still
protested
weakly
but
in
vain
his
affection
was
so
overwhelming
and
tender
that
it
made
me
weak
i
allowed
him
to
help
me
get
my
things
together
then
he
paid
the
bill
a
small
one
and
on
the
way
to
the
hotel
insisted
on
forcing
a
roll
of
bills
on
me
all
that
he
had
with
him
i
was
compelled
at
once
that
same
day
or
the
next
to
indulge
in
a
suit
hat
shoes
underwear
all
that
i
needed
a
bedroom
adjoining
his
suite
at
the
hotel
was
taken
and
for
two
days
i
lived
there
later
accompanying
him
in
his
car
to
a
famous
sanitarium
in
westchester
one
in
charge
of
an
old
friend
of
his
a
whose
fame
for
this
sort
of
work
was
great
here
i
was
booked
for
six
weeks
all
expenses
paid
until
i
should
be
on
my
feet
again
as
he
expressed
it
then
he
left
only
to
visit
and
revisit
me
until
i
returned
to
the
city
fairly
well
restored
in
nerves
if
not
in
health
but
could
one
ever
forget
the
mingled
sadness
and
fervor
of
his
original
appeal
the
actual
distress
written
in
his
face
the
unlimited
generosity
of
his
mood
and
deed
as
well
as
his
unmerited
one
pictures
such
tenderness
and
concern
as
existing
between
parents
and
children
but
rarely
between
brothers
here
he
was
evincing
the
same
thing
as
soft
as
love
itself
and
he
a
man
of
years
and
some
affairs
and
i
an
irritable
distrait
and
peevish
soul
take
note
ye
men
of
satire
and
spleen
all
men
are
not
selfish
or
hard
the
final
phase
of
course
related
to
his
untimely
end
he
was
not
quite
when
he
died
and
with
a
slightly
more
rugged
quality
of
mind
he
might
have
lasted
to
seventy
it
was
due
really
to
the
failure
of
his
firm
internal
dissensions
and
rivalries
in
no
way
due
to
him
however
as
i
have
been
told
and
what
he
foolishly
deemed
to
be
the
end
of
his
financial
and
social
glory
his
was
one
of
those
simple
confiding
dispositions
warm
and
colorful
but
intensely
sensitive
easily
and
even
fatally
chilled
by
the
icy
blasts
of
human
difficulty
however
slight
you
have
no
doubt
seen
some
animals
cats
dogs
birds
of
an
especially
affectionate
nature
which
when
translated
to
a
strange
or
unfriendly
climate
soon
droop
and
die
they
have
no
spiritual
resources
wherewith
to
contemplate
what
they
do
not
understand
or
know
now
his
friends
would
leave
him
now
that
bright
world
of
which
he
had
been
a
part
would
know
him
no
more
it
was
pathetic
really
he
emanated
a
kind
of
fear
depression
and
even
despair
seemed
to
hang
about
him
like
a
cloak
he
could
not
shake
it
off
and
yet
literally
in
his
case
there
was
nothing
to
fear
if
he
had
only
known
and
yet
two
years
before
he
did
die
i
knew
he
would
fantastic
as
it
may
seem
to
be
shut
out
from
that
bright
world
of
which
he
deemed
himself
an
essential
figure
was
all
but
unendurable
he
had
no
ready
money
now
not
the
same
amount
anyhow
he
could
not
greet
his
friends
so
gayly
entertain
so
freely
meeting
him
on
broadway
shortly
after
the
failure
and
asking
after
his
affairs
he
talked
of
going
into
business
for
himself
as
a
publisher
but
i
realized
that
he
could
not
he
had
neither
the
ability
nor
the
talent
for
that
nor
the
heart
he
was
not
a
business
man
but
a
and
actor
had
never
been
anything
but
that
he
tried
in
this
new
situation
to
write
songs
but
he
could
not
they
were
too
morbid
what
he
needed
was
some
one
to
buoy
him
up
a
manager
a
strong
confidant
of
some
kind
some
one
who
would
have
taken
his
affairs
in
hand
and
shown
him
what
to
do
as
it
was
he
had
no
one
his
friends
like
birds
had
already
departed
personally
i
was
in
no
position
to
do
anything
at
the
time
being
more
or
less
depressed
myself
and
but
slowly
emerging
from
difficulties
which
had
held
me
for
a
number
of
years
about
a
year
or
so
after
he
failed
my
sister
e
announced
that
paul
had
been
there
and
that
he
was
coming
to
live
with
her
he
could
not
pay
so
much
then
being
involved
with
all
sorts
of
examinations
of
one
kind
and
another
but
neither
did
he
have
to
her
memory
was
not
short
she
gave
him
the
fullness
of
her
home
a
few
months
later
he
was
ostensibly
connected
with
another
publishing
house
but
by
then
he
was
feeling
so
poorly
physically
and
was
finding
consolation
probably
in
some
drinking
and
the
caresses
of
those
feminine
friends
who
have
alas
only
caresses
to
offer
a
little
later
i
met
a
doctor
who
said
paul
can
not
live
he
has
pernicious
anæmia
he
is
breaking
down
inside
and
does
know
it
he
ca
last
long
he
too
depressed
i
knew
it
was
so
and
what
the
remedy
was
money
and
success
once
more
the
petty
pettings
and
flattery
of
that
little
world
of
which
he
had
been
a
part
but
which
now
was
no
more
for
him
of
all
those
who
had
been
so
lavish
in
their
greetings
and
companionship
earlier
in
his
life
scarcely
one
so
far
as
i
could
make
out
found
him
in
that
retired
world
to
which
he
was
forced
one
or
two
actors
sought
him
and
borrowed
a
little
of
the
little
that
he
had
a
few
others
came
when
he
had
nothing
at
all
his
partners
quarreling
among
themselves
and
feeling
that
they
had
done
him
an
injustice
remained
religiously
away
he
found
as
he
often
told
my
sister
broken
a
bad
sign
met
women
another
bad
sign
was
pursued
apparently
by
the
inimical
number
thirteen
and
all
these
little
straws
depressed
him
horribly
finally
being
no
longer
strong
enough
to
be
about
he
took
to
his
bed
and
remained
there
days
at
a
time
feeling
well
while
in
bed
but
weak
when
up
for
a
little
while
he
would
go
downtown
to
see
this
that
and
the
other
person
but
would
soon
return
one
day
on
coming
back
home
he
found
one
of
his
hats
lying
on
his
bed
accidentally
put
there
by
one
of
the
children
and
according
to
my
sister
who
was
present
at
the
time
he
was
all
but
petrified
by
the
sight
of
it
to
him
it
was
the
some
one
had
told
him
so
not
long
before
then
not
incuriously
seeing
the
affectional
tie
that
had
always
held
us
he
wanted
to
see
me
every
day
he
had
a
desire
to
talk
to
me
about
his
early
life
the
romance
of
it
maybe
i
could
write
a
story
some
time
tell
something
about
him
best
of
brothers
here
it
is
a
thin
little
flower
to
lay
at
your
feet
to
please
him
i
made
notes
although
i
knew
most
of
it
on
these
occasions
he
was
always
his
old
self
full
of
ridiculous
stories
quips
and
slight
all
in
his
old
and
best
vein
he
would
soon
be
himself
he
now
insisted
then
one
evening
in
late
november
before
i
had
time
to
call
upon
him
i
lived
about
a
mile
away
a
came
from
e
he
had
suddenly
died
at
five
in
the
afternoon
a
had
burst
in
the
head
when
i
arrived
he
was
already
cold
in
death
his
soft
hands
folded
over
his
chest
his
face
turned
to
one
side
on
the
pillow
that
indescribable
sweetness
of
expression
about
the
eyes
and
mouth
the
empty
shell
of
the
beetle
there
were
tears
a
band
of
reporters
from
the
papers
the
next
day
obituary
news
articles
and
after
that
a
host
of
friends
and
flowers
flowers
flowers
it
is
amazing
what
satisfaction
the
average
mind
takes
in
standardized
floral
forms
broken
columns
and
gates
ajar
being
ostensibly
a
catholic
a
catholic
and
other
relatives
insistently
arranged
for
a
solemn
high
requiem
mass
at
the
church
of
one
of
his
favorite
rectors
all
broadway
was
there
more
flowers
his
latest
song
read
from
the
altar
then
there
was
a
carriage
procession
to
a
distant
catholic
graveyard
somewhere
his
friend
the
rector
of
the
church
officiating
at
the
grave
it
was
so
cold
and
dreary
there
horrible
later
on
he
was
removed
to
chicago
but
still
i
think
of
him
as
not
there
or
anywhere
in
the
realm
of
space
but
on
broadway
between
and
streets
the
spring
and
summer
time
at
hand
the
doors
of
the
grills
and
bars
of
the
hotels
open
the
rout
of
actors
and
actresses
ambling
to
and
fro
his
own
delicious
presence
dressed
in
his
best
his
funny
stories
his
songs
being
ground
out
by
the
hand
organs
his
friends
extending
their
hands
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
cackling
over
the
latest
idle
yarn
ah
broadway
broadway
and
you
my
good
brother
here
is
the
story
that
you
wanted
me
to
write
this
little
testimony
to
your
memory
a
pale
pale
symbol
of
all
i
think
and
feel
where
are
the
thousand
yarns
i
have
laughed
over
the
music
the
lights
the
song
peace
peace
so
shall
it
soon
be
with
all
of
us
it
was
a
dream
it
is
i
am
you
are
and
shall
we
grieve
over
or
hark
back
to
dreams
county
how
well
i
remember
him
the
tall
grave
slightly
bent
figure
the
head
like
plato
or
that
of
diogenes
the
mild
kindly
eyes
peering
all
too
kindly
into
the
faces
of
dishonest
men
in
addition
he
wore
long
full
whiskers
a
long
gray
overcoat
soiled
and
patched
toward
the
last
in
winter
a
soft
black
hat
that
hung
darkeningly
over
his
eyes
but
what
a
doctor
and
how
simple
and
often
were
so
many
of
his
remedies
my
son
your
father
is
very
sick
now
i
tell
you
what
you
can
do
for
me
you
go
out
here
along
the
cheevertown
road
about
a
mile
or
two
and
ask
any
farmer
this
side
of
the
creek
to
let
you
have
a
good
big
handful
of
peach
sprigs
about
so
many
see
say
that
doctor
gridley
said
he
was
to
give
them
to
you
for
him
then
when
he
brings
them
you
take
a
few
not
more
than
seven
or
eight
and
break
them
up
and
steep
them
in
hot
water
until
you
have
an
tea
give
about
three
or
four
of
that
every
three
or
four
hours
and
i
hope
we
find
he
do
better
this
kidney
case
is
severe
i
know
but
he
come
around
all
right
and
he
did
my
father
had
been
very
ill
with
gall
stones
so
weak
at
last
that
we
thought
he
was
sure
to
die
the
house
was
so
somber
at
the
time
over
it
hung
an
atmosphere
of
depression
and
fear
with
pity
for
the
sufferer
and
groans
of
distress
on
his
part
and
then
there
were
the
solemn
visits
of
the
doctor
made
pleasant
by
his
wise
kindly
humor
and
his
hopeful
predictions
and
ending
in
this
seemingly
mild
prescription
which
resulted
in
this
case
in
a
cure
he
was
seemingly
so
remote
at
times
in
reality
so
near
and
wholly
thoughtful
on
this
occasion
i
went
out
along
the
long
cold
country
road
of
a
march
evening
i
was
full
of
thoughts
of
his
importance
as
a
doctor
he
seemed
so
necessary
to
us
as
he
did
to
everybody
i
knew
nothing
about
medicine
or
how
lives
were
saved
but
i
felt
sure
that
he
did
and
that
he
would
save
my
father
in
spite
of
his
always
conservative
speculative
doubtful
manner
what
a
wonderful
man
he
must
be
to
know
all
these
things
that
peach
sprouts
for
instance
were
an
antidote
to
the
agony
of
gall
stones
as
i
walked
along
the
simplicity
of
country
life
and
its
needs
and
deprivations
were
impressed
upon
me
even
though
i
was
so
young
so
few
here
could
afford
to
pay
for
expensive
prescriptions
ourselves
especially
and
gridley
knew
that
and
took
it
into
consideration
so
rarely
did
he
order
anything
from
a
most
often
what
he
prescribed
he
took
out
of
a
case
compounded
as
it
were
in
our
presence
a
brisk
wind
had
fluttered
snow
in
the
morning
and
now
the
ground
was
white
with
a
sinking
red
sun
shining
across
it
a
sense
of
spring
in
the
air
being
unknown
to
these
farmers
i
wondered
if
any
one
of
them
would
really
cut
me
a
double
handful
of
fresh
young
peach
sprigs
or
suckers
from
their
young
trees
as
the
doctor
had
said
did
they
really
know
him
some
one
along
the
road
a
farmer
told
me
of
an
old
mills
who
had
a
orchard
farther
on
in
a
little
while
i
came
to
his
door
and
was
confronted
by
a
thin
gaunt
bespectacled
woman
who
called
back
to
a
man
inside
henry
here
a
little
boy
says
gridley
said
you
were
to
cut
him
a
double
handful
of
peach
sprigs
henry
now
came
forward
a
tall
bony
farmer
in
high
boots
and
an
old
leather
coat
and
a
cap
of
wool
gridley
sent
cha
did
he
he
observed
eyeing
me
most
critically
yes
sir
what
the
matter
what
does
he
want
with
do
ya
know
yes
sir
my
father
sick
with
kidney
trouble
and
gridley
said
i
was
to
come
out
here
oh
all
right
wait
i
git
my
big
knife
and
back
he
went
returning
later
with
a
large
knife
which
he
opened
he
preceded
me
out
through
the
barn
lot
and
into
the
orchard
beyond
gridley
sent
cha
did
he
huh
he
asked
as
he
went
well
i
guess
we
all
have
ter
comply
with
whatever
the
doctor
orders
we
all
apt
ter
git
sick
now
an
and
talking
trivialities
of
a
like
character
he
cut
me
an
armful
saying
i
might
as
well
give
ya
too
many
as
too
few
peach
sprigs
now
i
never
heered
o
them
bein
good
fer
anythin
but
i
reckon
the
doctor
knows
what
he
talkin
about
he
usually
does
or
that
what
we
think
around
here
anyhow
in
the
dusk
i
trudged
home
with
my
armful
my
fingers
cold
the
next
morning
the
tea
having
been
brewed
and
taken
my
father
was
better
in
a
week
or
two
he
was
up
and
around
as
well
as
ever
and
during
this
time
he
commented
on
the
efficacy
of
this
tea
which
was
something
new
to
him
a
strange
remedy
and
which
caused
the
whole
incident
to
be
impressed
upon
my
mind
the
doctor
had
told
him
that
at
any
time
in
the
future
if
he
was
so
troubled
and
could
get
fresh
young
peach
sprigs
for
a
tea
he
would
find
that
it
would
help
him
and
the
drug
expense
was
exactly
nothing
in
later
years
i
came
to
know
him
better
this
thoughtful
crusty
kindly
soul
always
so
ready
to
come
at
all
hours
when
his
cases
permitted
so
anxious
to
see
that
his
patients
were
not
taxed
beyond
their
financial
resources
i
remember
once
one
of
my
sisters
being
very
ill
so
ill
that
we
were
beginning
to
fear
death
one
and
another
of
us
had
to
take
turn
sitting
up
with
her
at
night
to
help
and
to
give
her
her
medicine
regularly
during
one
of
the
nights
when
i
was
sitting
up
dozing
reading
and
listening
to
the
wind
in
the
pines
outside
she
seemed
persistently
to
get
worse
her
fever
rose
and
she
complained
of
such
aches
and
pains
that
finally
i
had
to
go
and
call
my
mother
a
consultation
with
her
finally
resulted
in
my
being
sent
for
gridley
no
telephones
in
those
days
to
tell
him
although
she
hesitated
so
to
do
how
sister
was
and
ask
him
if
he
would
not
come
i
was
only
fourteen
the
street
along
which
i
had
to
go
was
quite
dark
the
town
lights
being
put
out
at
two
for
reasons
of
thrift
perhaps
there
was
a
high
wind
that
cried
in
the
trees
my
shoes
on
the
board
walks
here
and
there
sounded
like
the
thuds
of
a
giant
i
recall
progressing
in
a
shivery
sort
of
way
expecting
at
any
step
to
encounter
goblins
of
the
most
approved
form
until
finally
the
outlines
of
the
house
of
the
doctor
on
the
main
street
yellow
a
wide
porch
in
front
came
because
of
a
very
small
lamp
in
a
very
large
glass
case
to
one
side
of
the
door
into
view
here
i
knocked
and
then
knocked
more
no
reply
i
then
made
a
still
more
forceful
effort
finally
through
one
of
the
red
glass
panels
which
graced
either
side
of
the
door
i
saw
the
lengthy
figure
of
the
doctor
arrayed
in
a
long
white
nightshirt
and
carrying
a
small
glass
come
into
view
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
his
feet
were
in
gray
flannel
slippers
and
his
whiskers
stuck
out
most
grotesquely
wait
wait
i
heard
him
call
i
be
there
i
coming
do
make
such
a
fuss
it
seems
as
though
i
never
get
a
real
good
night
rest
any
more
he
came
on
opened
the
door
and
looked
out
well
he
demanded
a
little
fussily
for
him
what
the
matter
now
doctor
i
began
and
proceeded
to
explain
all
my
sister
aches
and
pains
winding
up
by
saying
that
my
mother
said
would
he
please
come
at
once
your
mother
he
grumbled
what
can
i
do
if
i
do
come
down
not
a
thing
feel
her
pulse
and
tell
her
she
all
right
that
every
bit
i
can
do
your
mother
knows
that
as
well
as
i
do
that
disease
has
to
run
its
course
he
looked
at
me
as
though
i
were
to
blame
then
added
calling
me
up
this
way
at
three
in
the
morning
but
she
in
such
pain
doctor
i
complained
all
right
everybody
has
to
have
a
little
pain
you
ca
be
sick
without
it
i
know
i
replied
disconsolately
believing
sincerely
that
my
sister
might
die
but
she
in
such
awful
pain
doctor
well
go
on
he
replied
turning
up
the
light
i
know
it
all
foolishness
but
i
come
you
go
back
and
tell
your
mother
that
be
there
in
a
little
bit
but
it
all
nonsense
nonsense
she
is
a
bit
sicker
than
i
am
right
this
minute
not
a
bit
and
he
closed
the
door
and
went
upstairs
to
me
this
seemed
just
the
least
bit
harsh
for
the
doctor
although
as
i
reasoned
afterwards
he
was
probably
and
tired
dragged
out
of
his
bed
possibly
once
or
twice
before
in
the
same
night
as
i
returned
home
i
felt
even
more
fearful
for
once
as
i
was
passing
a
woodshed
which
i
could
not
see
a
rooster
suddenly
flapped
his
wings
and
crowed
a
sound
which
caused
me
to
leap
all
of
nineteen
feet
fahrenheit
sidewise
then
as
i
walked
along
a
fence
which
later
by
day
i
saw
had
a
comfortable
resting
board
on
top
two
lambent
golden
eyes
surveyed
me
out
of
inky
darkness
great
hamlet
father
how
my
heart
sank
once
more
i
leaped
to
the
cloddy
roadway
and
seizing
a
cobblestone
or
hunk
of
mud
hurled
it
with
all
my
might
and
quite
involuntarily
then
i
ran
until
i
fell
into
a
crossing
ditch
it
was
an
amazing
almost
a
tragic
experience
then
in
due
time
the
doctor
came
and
i
never
quite
forgave
him
for
not
making
me
wait
and
go
back
with
him
he
was
too
sleepy
though
i
am
sure
the
seizure
was
apparently
nothing
which
could
not
have
waited
until
morning
however
he
left
some
new
cure
possibly
clear
water
in
a
bottle
and
left
again
but
the
night
trials
of
doctors
and
their
patients
especially
in
the
country
was
fixed
in
my
mind
then
one
of
the
next
interesting
impressions
i
gained
of
the
doctor
was
that
of
seeing
him
hobbling
about
our
town
on
crutches
his
medicine
case
held
in
one
hand
along
with
a
crutch
visiting
his
patients
when
he
himself
appeared
to
be
so
ill
as
to
require
medical
attention
he
was
suffering
from
some
severe
form
of
rheumatism
at
the
time
but
this
apparently
was
not
sufficient
to
keep
him
from
those
who
in
his
judgment
probably
needed
his
services
more
than
he
did
his
rest
one
of
the
truly
interesting
things
about
gridley
as
i
early
began
to
note
was
his
profound
indifference
to
what
might
be
called
his
material
welfare
why
i
have
often
asked
myself
should
a
man
of
so
much
genuine
ability
choose
to
ignore
the
gauds
and
plaudits
and
pleasures
of
the
gayer
smarter
world
outside
in
which
he
might
readily
have
shone
to
thus
devote
himself
and
all
his
talents
to
a
simple
rural
community
that
he
was
an
extremely
able
physician
there
was
not
the
slightest
doubt
other
physicians
from
other
towns
about
and
even
so
far
away
as
chicago
were
repeatedly
calling
him
into
consultation
that
he
knew
life
much
of
it
as
only
a
priest
or
a
doctor
of
true
wisdom
can
know
it
was
evident
from
many
incidents
of
which
i
subsequently
learned
and
yet
here
he
was
hidden
away
in
this
simple
rural
world
surrounded
probably
by
his
rabelais
his
burton
his
frazer
and
his
montaigne
and
dreaming
what
dreams
thinking
what
thoughts
say
an
old
patient
friend
and
neighbor
of
his
once
remarked
to
me
years
later
when
we
had
both
moved
to
another
city
one
of
the
sweetest
recollections
of
my
life
is
to
picture
old
gridley
ed
boulder
who
used
to
run
the
hotel
over
at
sleichertown
congressman
barr
and
judge
morgan
sitting
out
in
front
of
boulder
hotel
over
there
of
a
summer
evening
and
over
the
funny
stories
which
boulder
was
always
telling
while
they
were
waiting
for
the
pierceton
bus
gridley
laugh
so
soft
to
begin
with
but
growing
in
force
and
volume
until
it
was
a
jolly
shout
and
the
green
fields
all
around
and
calder
drove
of
geese
over
the
way
honking
too
as
geese
will
whenever
people
begin
to
talk
or
laugh
it
was
delicious
one
of
the
most
significant
traits
of
his
character
as
may
be
inferred
was
his
absolute
indifference
to
actual
money
the
very
cash
one
would
think
with
which
he
needed
to
buy
his
own
supplies
during
his
life
his
wife
who
was
a
thrifty
woman
used
frequently
as
i
learned
after
to
comment
on
this
but
to
no
result
he
could
not
be
made
to
charge
where
he
did
not
need
to
nor
collect
where
he
knew
that
the
people
were
poor
once
he
became
angry
at
my
uncle
his
daughter
once
told
me
because
he
offered
to
collect
for
him
for
three
per
cent
dunning
his
patients
for
their
debts
and
another
time
he
dissolved
a
partnership
with
a
local
physician
who
insisted
that
he
ought
to
be
more
careful
to
charge
and
collect
this
generosity
on
his
part
frequently
led
to
some
very
interesting
results
on
one
occasion
for
instance
when
he
was
sitting
out
on
his
front
lawn
in
warsaw
smoking
his
chair
tilted
back
against
a
tree
and
his
legs
crossed
in
the
fashion
known
as
a
poorly
dressed
farmer
without
a
coat
came
up
and
after
saluting
the
doctor
began
to
explain
that
his
wife
was
sick
and
that
he
had
come
to
get
the
advice
he
seemed
quite
disturbed
and
every
now
and
then
wiped
his
brow
while
the
doctor
listened
with
an
occasional
question
or
gently
accented
until
the
story
was
all
told
and
the
advice
ready
to
be
received
when
this
was
given
in
a
low
reassuring
tone
he
took
from
his
pocket
his
little
book
of
blanks
and
wrote
out
a
prescription
which
he
gave
to
the
man
and
began
talking
again
the
latter
took
out
a
silver
dollar
and
handed
it
to
the
doctor
who
turned
it
idly
between
his
fingers
for
a
few
seconds
then
searched
in
his
pocket
for
a
mate
to
it
and
playing
with
them
a
while
as
he
talked
finally
handed
back
the
dollar
to
the
farmer
you
take
that
he
said
pleasantly
and
go
down
to
the
and
have
the
prescription
filled
i
think
your
wife
will
be
all
right
when
he
had
gone
the
doctor
sat
there
a
long
time
meditatively
puffing
the
smoke
from
his
cob
pipe
and
turning
his
own
dollar
in
his
hand
after
a
time
he
looked
up
at
his
daughter
who
was
present
and
said
i
was
just
thinking
what
a
short
time
it
took
me
to
write
that
prescription
and
what
a
long
time
it
took
him
to
earn
that
dollar
i
guess
he
needs
the
dollar
more
than
i
do
in
the
same
spirit
of
this
generosity
he
was
once
sitting
in
his
yard
of
a
summer
day
sunning
himself
and
smoking
a
favorite
pleasure
of
his
when
two
men
rode
up
to
his
gate
from
opposite
directions
and
simultaneously
hailed
him
he
arose
and
went
out
to
meet
them
his
wife
who
was
sewing
just
inside
the
hall
as
she
usually
was
when
her
husband
was
outside
leaned
forward
in
her
chair
to
see
through
the
door
and
took
note
of
who
they
were
both
were
men
in
whose
families
the
doctor
had
practiced
for
years
one
was
a
prosperous
farmer
who
always
paid
his
doctor
bills
and
the
other
was
a
miller
a
with
a
delicate
wife
and
a
family
of
sickly
children
who
never
asked
for
a
statement
and
never
had
one
sent
him
and
who
only
occasionally
and
at
great
intervals
handed
the
doctor
a
dollar
in
payment
for
his
many
services
both
men
talked
to
him
a
little
while
and
then
rode
away
after
which
he
returned
to
the
house
calling
to
enoch
his
old
negro
servant
to
bring
his
horse
and
then
went
into
his
study
to
prepare
his
medicine
case
gridley
who
was
naturally
interested
in
his
financial
welfare
and
who
at
times
had
to
plead
with
him
not
to
let
his
generosity
stand
wholly
in
the
way
of
his
judgment
inquired
of
him
as
he
came
out
now
doctor
which
of
those
two
men
are
you
going
with
why
miss
susan
he
replied
a
favorite
manner
of
addressing
his
wife
of
whom
he
was
very
fond
the
note
of
apology
in
his
voice
showing
that
he
knew
very
well
what
she
was
thinking
about
i
going
with
w
i
do
think
that
is
right
she
replied
with
mild
emphasis
n
is
as
good
a
friend
of
yours
as
w
and
he
always
pays
you
now
miss
susan
he
returned
coaxingly
n
can
go
to
pierceton
and
get
doctor
bodine
and
w
ca
get
any
one
but
me
you
surely
would
have
him
left
without
any
one
what
the
effect
of
such
an
attitude
was
may
be
judged
when
it
is
related
that
there
was
scarcely
a
man
woman
or
child
in
the
entire
county
who
had
not
at
some
time
or
other
been
directly
or
indirectly
benefited
by
the
kindly
wisdom
of
this
samaritan
he
was
nearly
everybody
doctor
in
the
last
extremity
either
as
consultant
or
otherwise
everywhere
he
went
by
every
lane
and
hollow
that
he
fared
he
was
constantly
being
called
into
service
by
some
one
the
as
well
as
by
those
who
had
nothing
and
in
both
cases
he
was
equally
keen
to
give
the
same
degree
of
painstaking
skill
finding
something
in
the
very
poor
a
humanness
possibly
which
detained
and
fascinated
him
and
made
him
a
little
more
prone
to
linger
at
their
bedsides
than
anywhere
else
he
was
always
doing
it
said
his
daughter
and
my
mother
used
to
worry
over
it
she
declared
that
of
all
things
earthly
papa
loved
an
unfortunate
person
the
greater
the
misfortune
the
greater
his
care
in
illustration
of
his
easy
and
practically
controlling
attitude
toward
the
very
who
were
his
patients
also
let
me
narrate
this
in
our
town
was
an
old
and
very
distinguished
colonel
comparatively
rich
and
very
crotchety
who
had
won
considerable
honors
for
himself
during
the
civil
war
he
was
a
figure
and
very
much
looked
up
to
by
all
people
were
in
the
main
overawed
by
and
highly
respectful
of
him
a
remote
stern
soul
yet
to
gridley
he
was
little
more
than
a
child
or
schoolboy
one
to
be
bossed
on
occasion
and
made
to
behave
plainly
the
doctor
had
the
conviction
that
all
of
us
great
and
small
were
very
much
in
need
of
sympathy
and
care
and
that
he
the
doctor
was
the
one
to
provide
it
at
any
rate
he
had
known
the
colonel
long
and
well
and
in
a
public
place
at
the
principal
street
corner
for
instance
or
in
the
postoffice
where
we
school
children
were
wont
to
congregate
it
was
not
at
all
surprising
to
hear
him
take
the
old
colonel
who
was
quite
frail
now
to
task
for
not
taking
better
care
of
himself
coming
out
for
instance
without
his
rubbers
or
his
overcoat
in
wet
or
chilly
weather
and
in
other
ways
misbehaving
himself
there
you
go
again
i
once
heard
him
call
to
the
colonel
as
the
latter
was
leaving
the
postoffice
and
he
was
entering
there
was
no
rural
free
delivery
in
those
days
walking
around
without
your
rubbers
and
no
overcoat
you
want
to
get
me
up
in
the
night
again
do
you
it
did
seem
so
damp
when
i
started
out
doctor
and
of
course
it
was
too
much
trouble
to
go
back
you
would
feel
that
way
if
you
could
come
out
at
all
perhaps
i
put
on
i
put
on
only
please
do
fuss
doctor
go
back
to
the
house
and
put
on
the
doctor
merely
stared
after
him
quizzically
like
an
old
schoolmaster
as
the
rather
stately
colonel
marched
off
to
his
home
another
of
his
patients
was
an
old
pegram
a
large
kind
man
who
was
very
fond
of
the
doctor
but
who
had
an
exceedingly
irascible
temper
he
was
the
victim
of
some
obscure
malady
which
medicine
apparently
failed
at
times
to
relieve
this
seemed
to
increase
his
irritability
a
great
deal
so
much
so
that
the
doctor
had
at
last
discovered
that
if
he
could
get
pegram
angry
enough
the
malady
would
occasionally
disappear
this
seemed
at
times
as
good
a
remedy
as
any
and
in
consequence
he
was
occasionally
inclined
to
try
it
among
other
things
this
old
gentleman
was
the
possessor
of
a
handsome
buffalo
robe
which
according
to
a
story
that
long
went
the
rounds
locally
he
once
promised
to
leave
to
the
doctor
when
he
died
at
the
same
time
all
reference
to
death
both
pained
and
irritated
him
greatly
a
fact
which
the
doctor
knew
finding
the
old
gentleman
in
a
most
complaining
and
hopeless
mood
one
night
not
to
be
dealt
with
indeed
in
any
reasoning
way
the
doctor
returned
to
his
home
and
early
the
next
day
without
any
other
word
sent
old
enoch
his
negro
servant
around
to
get
as
he
said
the
buffalo
robe
a
request
which
would
indicate
of
course
that
the
doctor
had
concluded
that
old
pegram
had
died
or
was
about
to
a
hopeless
case
when
ushered
into
the
latter
presence
enoch
began
innocently
enough
de
doctah
say
dat
now
dat
hab
subspired
he
was
to
hab
dat
ba
ba
buffalo
robe
what
shouted
the
old
irascible
rising
and
clambering
out
of
his
bed
what
that
buffalo
robe
by
god
you
go
back
and
tell
old
doc
gridley
that
i
ai
dead
yet
by
a
damned
sight
no
sir
and
forthwith
he
dressed
himself
and
was
out
and
around
the
same
day
persons
who
met
the
doctor
as
i
heard
years
later
from
his
daughter
and
from
others
who
had
known
him
were
frequently
asking
him
just
in
a
social
way
what
to
do
for
certain
ailments
and
he
would
as
often
reply
in
a
humorous
and
manner
that
if
he
were
in
their
place
he
would
do
or
take
not
meaning
really
that
they
should
do
so
but
merely
to
get
rid
of
them
and
indicating
of
course
any
one
of
a
hundred
harmless
things
never
one
that
could
really
have
proved
injurious
to
any
one
once
according
to
his
daughter
as
he
was
driving
into
town
from
somewhere
he
met
a
man
on
a
lumber
wagon
whom
he
scarcely
knew
but
who
knew
him
well
enough
who
stopped
and
showed
him
a
sore
on
the
upper
tip
of
his
ear
asking
him
what
he
would
do
for
it
oh
said
the
doctor
idly
and
jestingly
i
think
i
cut
it
off
yes
said
the
man
very
much
pleased
with
this
free
advice
with
what
doctor
oh
i
think
i
use
a
pair
of
scissors
he
replied
amusedly
scarcely
assuming
that
his
jesting
would
be
taken
seriously
the
driver
jogged
on
and
the
doctor
did
not
see
or
hear
of
him
again
until
some
two
months
later
when
meeting
him
in
the
street
the
driver
smilingly
approached
him
and
enthusiastically
exclaimed
well
doc
you
see
i
cut
off
and
she
got
well
yes
replied
the
doctor
solemnly
not
remembering
anything
about
the
case
but
willing
to
appear
interested
what
was
it
you
cut
off
why
that
sore
on
my
ear
up
here
you
know
you
told
me
to
cut
it
off
and
i
did
yes
said
the
doctor
becoming
curious
and
a
little
amazed
with
what
why
with
a
pair
of
scissors
doc
just
like
you
said
the
doctor
stared
at
him
the
whole
thing
coming
gradually
back
to
him
but
did
you
have
some
trouble
in
cutting
it
off
he
inquired
in
disturbed
astonishment
no
no
said
the
driver
i
made
sharp
all
right
i
spent
two
days
whettin
up
and
bob
hart
cut
off
fer
me
they
cut
all
right
but
i
tell
you
she
hurt
when
she
went
through
the
gristle
he
smiled
in
pleased
remembrance
of
his
surgical
operation
and
the
doctor
smiled
also
but
according
to
his
daughter
he
decided
to
give
no
more
idle
advice
of
that
kind
in
the
school
which
i
attended
for
a
period
were
two
of
his
sons
fred
and
walter
both
were
very
fond
of
birds
and
kept
a
number
of
one
kind
or
another
about
their
home
not
in
cages
as
some
might
but
inveigled
and
trained
as
pets
and
living
in
the
various
open
fixed
about
the
yard
on
poles
the
doctor
himself
was
intensely
fond
of
these
and
all
other
birds
and
according
to
his
daughter
and
his
sons
always
anticipated
the
spring
return
of
many
of
diem
blue
jays
wrens
and
robins
with
a
hopeful
well
now
they
soon
be
here
again
during
the
summer
according
to
her
he
was
always
an
interested
spectator
of
their
gyrations
in
the
air
and
when
evening
would
come
was
never
so
happy
as
when
standing
and
staring
at
them
gathering
from
all
directions
to
their
roosts
in
the
trees
or
the
birdhouses
similarly
when
the
fall
approached
and
they
would
begin
their
long
flight
southward
he
would
sometimes
stand
and
scan
the
sky
and
trees
in
vain
for
a
final
glimpse
of
his
feathered
friends
and
when
in
the
gathering
darkness
they
were
no
longer
to
be
seen
would
turn
away
toward
the
house
saying
sadly
to
his
daughter
well
dollie
the
blackbirds
are
all
gone
i
am
sorry
i
like
to
see
them
and
i
am
always
sorry
to
lose
them
and
sorry
to
know
that
winter
is
coming
usually
about
the
or
of
december
his
daughter
once
quaintly
added
to
me
he
would
note
that
the
days
were
beginning
to
get
longer
and
cheer
up
as
spring
was
certain
to
follow
soon
and
bring
them
all
back
again
one
of
the
most
interesting
of
his
bird
friendships
was
that
which
existed
between
him
and
a
pair
of
crows
he
and
his
sons
had
raised
jim
and
zip
by
name
these
crows
came
to
know
him
well
and
were
finally
so
humanly
attached
to
him
that
according
to
his
family
they
would
often
fly
two
or
three
miles
out
of
town
to
meet
him
and
would
then
accompany
him
lighting
on
fences
and
trees
by
the
way
and
cawing
to
him
as
he
drove
along
both
of
them
were
great
thieves
and
would
steal
anything
from
a
bit
of
thread
up
to
a
sewing
machine
if
they
could
have
carried
it
they
were
always
walking
about
the
house
cheerfully
looking
for
what
they
might
devour
and
on
one
occasion
carried
off
a
set
of
spoons
which
they
hid
about
the
eaves
of
the
house
on
another
occasion
they
stole
a
half
dozen
pocket
knives
which
the
doctor
had
bought
for
the
children
and
which
the
crows
seemed
to
like
for
the
brightness
of
the
metal
they
were
recovered
once
by
the
children
stolen
again
by
the
crows
recovered
once
more
and
so
on
until
at
last
it
was
a
question
as
to
which
were
the
rightful
owners
the
doctor
was
sitting
in
front
of
a
store
one
day
in
the
of
town
where
also
he
liked
to
linger
in
fair
weather
when
suddenly
he
saw
one
of
his
crows
flying
high
overhead
and
bearing
something
in
its
beak
which
it
dropped
into
the
road
scarcely
a
hundred
feet
away
interested
to
see
what
it
was
the
bird
had
been
carrying
he
went
to
the
spot
where
he
saw
it
fall
and
found
one
of
the
knives
which
the
crow
had
been
carrying
to
a
safe
he
picked
it
up
and
when
he
returned
home
that
night
asked
one
of
his
boys
if
he
could
lend
him
a
knife
no
said
his
son
our
knives
are
all
lost
the
crows
took
them
i
knew
that
said
the
doctor
sweetly
and
so
when
i
met
zip
uptown
just
now
i
asked
her
to
lend
me
one
and
she
did
here
it
is
he
pulled
out
the
knife
and
handed
it
to
the
boy
and
when
the
latter
expressed
doubt
and
wonder
insisted
that
the
crow
had
loaned
it
to
him
a
joke
which
ended
in
his
always
asking
one
of
the
children
to
run
and
ask
zip
if
she
would
lend
him
a
knife
whenever
he
chanced
to
need
one
although
a
sad
man
at
times
as
i
understood
the
doctor
was
not
a
pessimist
and
in
many
ways
both
by
practical
jokes
and
the
humoring
of
odd
characters
sought
relief
from
the
intense
emotional
strain
which
the
large
practice
of
his
profession
put
upon
him
one
of
his
greatest
reliefs
was
the
carrying
out
of
these
little
practical
jokes
and
he
had
been
known
to
go
to
much
trouble
at
times
to
work
up
a
good
laugh
one
of
the
to
him
richest
jokes
and
one
which
he
always
enjoyed
telling
related
to
a
country
singing
school
which
was
located
in
the
neighborhood
of
pierceton
in
which
reading
the
alphabet
at
least
spelling
geography
arithmetic
rules
of
grammar
and
so
forth
were
still
taught
by
a
process
of
singing
the
method
adopted
in
this
form
of
education
was
to
have
the
scholar
memorize
all
knowledge
by
singing
it
thus
in
the
case
of
geography
the
students
would
sing
the
name
of
the
country
then
its
mountains
then
the
highest
peaks
cities
rivers
principal
points
of
interest
and
so
on
until
all
information
about
that
particular
country
had
been
duly
memorized
in
song
or
rhyme
occasionally
they
would
have
a
on
which
the
local
dignitaries
would
be
invited
and
on
a
number
of
these
occasions
the
doctor
was
for
amusement
sake
merely
a
grave
and
reverent
listener
on
one
occasion
however
he
was
merely
passing
the
school
when
hearing
mountains
of
the
drawled
out
of
the
windows
he
decided
to
stop
in
and
listen
a
while
having
tethered
his
horse
outside
he
knocked
at
the
door
and
was
received
by
the
little
english
singing
teacher
who
after
showing
him
to
a
seat
immediately
called
upon
the
class
for
an
exhibition
of
their
finest
wisdom
when
they
had
finished
this
the
teacher
turned
to
him
and
inquired
if
there
was
anything
he
would
especially
like
them
to
sing
no
said
the
doctor
gravely
and
no
doubt
with
an
amused
twinkle
in
his
eye
i
had
thought
of
asking
you
to
sing
the
rocky
mountains
but
as
the
mountains
are
so
high
and
the
amount
of
time
i
have
so
limited
i
have
decided
that
perhaps
it
will
be
asking
too
much
oh
not
at
all
not
at
all
airily
replied
the
teacher
and
turning
to
his
class
he
exclaimed
with
a
very
superior
smile
now
ladies
and
gentlemen
is
a
scientific
gentleman
who
thinks
it
is
to
sing
of
mountings
than
it
is
to
sing
of
mountings
and
forthwith
the
class
began
to
demonstrate
that
in
respect
to
vocalization
there
was
no
difference
at
all
only
those
however
who
knew
gridley
in
the
sickroom
and
knew
him
well
ever
discovered
the
really
finest
trait
of
his
character
a
keen
unshielded
sensibility
to
and
sympathy
for
all
human
suffering
that
could
not
bear
to
inflict
the
slightest
additional
pain
he
was
really
in
the
main
a
man
of
soft
tones
and
unctuous
laughter
of
gentle
touch
and
gentle
step
and
a
devotion
to
duty
that
carried
him
far
beyond
his
interests
or
his
personal
one
of
his
chiefest
oppositions
according
to
his
daughter
was
to
telling
the
friends
or
relatives
of
any
stricken
person
that
there
was
no
hope
instead
he
would
use
every
delicate
shade
of
phrasing
and
tone
in
imparting
the
fateful
words
in
order
if
possible
to
give
less
pain
i
remember
in
the
case
of
my
father
said
one
of
his
friends
when
the
last
day
came
knowing
the
end
was
near
he
was
compelled
to
make
some
preliminary
discouraging
remark
and
i
bent
over
with
my
ear
against
my
father
chest
and
said
gridley
the
disease
is
under
control
i
think
i
can
hear
the
respiration
to
the
bottom
of
the
lungs
yes
he
answered
me
sadly
but
now
with
an
implication
which
could
by
no
means
be
misunderstood
is
nearly
always
so
the
failure
is
in
the
recuperative
energy
vitality
runs
too
low
it
meant
from
the
first
father
will
not
live
in
the
case
of
a
little
child
with
meningitis
the
same
person
was
sent
to
him
to
ask
what
of
the
child
better
or
worse
his
answer
was
he
is
passing
as
free
from
pain
as
ever
i
knew
a
case
of
this
kind
in
yet
another
case
of
a
dying
woman
one
of
her
relatives
inquired
doctor
is
this
case
dangerous
not
in
the
nature
of
the
malady
madam
was
his
sad
and
sympathetic
reply
but
fatal
in
the
condition
it
meets
hope
is
broken
there
is
nothing
to
resist
the
damage
one
of
his
patients
was
a
farmer
who
lived
in
an
log
house
a
few
miles
out
from
silver
lake
who
while
working
about
his
barn
met
with
a
very
serious
accident
which
involved
a
possible
injury
to
the
gall
bladder
the
main
accident
was
not
in
itself
fatal
but
the
possible
injury
to
the
gall
bladder
was
and
this
if
it
existed
would
show
as
a
yellow
tint
in
the
eyeball
on
the
tenth
day
fearing
the
danger
of
this
he
communicated
the
possibility
to
the
relatives
saying
that
he
could
do
little
after
that
time
but
that
he
would
come
just
the
same
and
make
the
patient
as
comfortable
as
possible
for
nine
days
he
came
sitting
by
the
bedside
and
whiling
away
many
a
weary
hour
for
the
sufferer
until
the
tenth
morning
on
this
day
according
to
his
daughter
who
had
it
from
the
sick
man
relatives
his
face
but
ill
concealed
the
anxiety
he
felt
coming
up
to
the
door
he
entered
just
far
enough
to
pretend
to
reach
for
a
water
bucket
with
this
in
his
hand
he
turned
and
gave
one
long
keen
look
in
the
eye
of
the
sick
man
then
walked
down
the
yard
to
a
chair
under
a
tree
some
distance
from
the
house
where
he
sat
drooping
and
apparently
grieved
the
certainty
of
the
death
of
the
patient
affecting
him
as
much
as
if
he
were
his
own
child
there
was
no
need
for
words
said
one
of
them
every
curve
and
droop
of
his
figure
as
he
walked
slowly
and
with
bent
head
told
all
of
us
who
saw
him
that
hope
was
gone
and
that
death
had
won
the
victory
one
of
his
perpetual
charges
as
i
learned
later
was
a
poor
old
unfortunate
by
the
name
of
id
logan
who
had
a
little
cabin
and
an
acre
of
ground
a
half
dozen
miles
west
of
warsaw
and
who
existed
from
year
to
year
heaven
only
knows
how
id
never
had
any
money
friends
or
relatives
and
was
always
troubled
with
illness
or
hunger
in
some
form
or
other
and
yet
the
doctor
always
spoke
of
him
sympathetically
as
poor
old
id
logan
and
would
often
call
out
there
on
his
rounds
to
see
how
he
was
getting
along
one
snowy
winter
evening
as
he
was
traveling
homeward
after
a
long
day
ride
he
chanced
to
recollect
the
fact
that
he
was
in
the
neighborhood
of
his
worthless
old
charge
and
fancying
that
he
might
be
in
need
of
something
turned
his
horse
into
the
lane
which
led
up
to
the
door
when
he
reached
the
house
he
noticed
that
no
smoke
was
coming
from
the
chimney
and
that
the
windows
were
slightly
rimmed
with
frost
as
if
there
were
no
heat
within
rapping
at
the
door
and
receiving
no
response
he
opened
it
and
went
in
there
he
found
his
old
charge
sick
and
wandering
in
his
mind
lying
upon
a
bed
and
moaning
in
pain
there
was
no
fire
in
the
fireplace
the
coverings
with
which
the
bed
was
fitted
were
but
two
or
three
old
worn
and
faded
quilts
and
the
snow
was
sifting
in
badly
through
the
cracks
where
the
chinking
had
fallen
out
between
the
logs
and
under
the
doors
and
windows
going
up
to
the
sufferer
and
finding
that
some
one
of
his
old
and
to
the
doctor
maladies
had
at
last
secured
a
fatal
grip
upon
him
he
first
administered
a
tonic
which
he
knew
would
give
him
as
much
strength
as
possible
and
then
went
out
into
the
yard
where
after
putting
up
his
horse
he
gathered
chips
and
wood
from
under
the
snow
and
built
a
roaring
fire
having
done
this
he
put
on
the
kettle
trimmed
the
lamp
and
after
preparing
such
stimulants
as
the
patient
could
stand
took
his
place
at
the
bedside
where
he
remained
the
whole
night
long
keeping
the
fire
going
and
the
patient
as
comfortable
as
possible
toward
morning
the
sufferer
died
and
when
the
sun
was
well
up
he
finally
returned
to
his
family
who
anxiously
solicited
him
as
to
his
whereabouts
i
was
with
id
logan
he
said
what
ailing
him
now
his
daughter
inquired
nothing
now
he
returned
it
was
only
last
night
and
for
years
afterward
he
commented
on
the
death
of
poor
old
id
saying
always
at
the
conclusion
of
his
remarks
that
it
must
be
a
dreadful
thing
to
be
sick
and
die
without
friends
his
love
for
his
old
friends
and
familiar
objects
was
striking
and
he
could
no
more
bear
to
see
an
old
friend
move
away
than
he
could
to
lose
one
of
his
patients
one
of
his
oldest
friends
was
a
fine
old
christian
lady
by
the
name
of
weeks
who
lived
down
in
louter
creek
bottoms
and
in
whose
household
he
had
practiced
for
nearly
fifty
years
during
the
latter
part
of
his
life
however
this
family
began
to
break
up
and
finally
when
there
was
no
one
left
but
the
mother
she
decided
to
move
over
into
whitley
county
where
she
could
stay
with
her
daughter
just
before
going
however
she
expressed
a
wish
to
see
doctor
gridley
and
he
called
in
upon
her
a
little
dinner
had
been
prepared
in
honor
of
his
coming
after
it
was
over
and
the
old
times
were
fully
discussed
he
was
about
to
take
his
leave
when
mrs
weeks
disappeared
from
the
room
and
then
returned
bearing
upon
her
arm
a
beautiful
yarn
spread
which
she
held
out
before
her
and
in
her
nervous
feeble
way
getting
the
attention
of
the
little
audience
said
doctor
i
am
going
up
to
whitley
now
to
live
with
my
daughter
and
i
do
suppose
i
will
get
to
see
you
very
often
any
more
like
myself
you
are
getting
old
and
it
will
be
too
far
for
you
to
come
but
i
want
to
give
you
this
spread
that
i
have
woven
with
my
own
hands
since
i
have
been
sixty
years
of
age
it
is
very
much
but
it
is
meant
for
a
token
of
the
love
and
esteem
i
bear
you
and
in
remembrance
of
all
that
you
have
done
for
me
and
mine
her
eyes
were
wet
and
her
voice
quivering
as
she
brought
it
forward
the
doctor
who
had
been
wholly
taken
by
surprise
by
this
kindly
manifestation
of
regard
had
arisen
during
her
impromptu
address
and
now
stood
before
her
dignified
and
emotionally
grave
his
own
eyes
wet
with
tears
of
appreciation
balancing
the
homely
gift
upon
his
extended
hands
he
waited
until
the
force
of
his
own
sentiment
had
slightly
subsided
when
he
replied
madam
i
appreciate
this
gift
with
which
you
have
chosen
to
remember
me
as
much
as
i
honor
the
sentiment
which
has
produced
it
there
are
i
know
threads
of
feeling
woven
into
it
stronger
than
any
cords
of
wool
and
more
enduring
than
all
the
fabrics
of
this
world
i
have
been
your
physician
now
for
fifty
years
and
have
been
a
witness
of
your
joys
and
sorrows
but
as
much
as
i
esteem
you
and
as
highly
as
i
prize
this
token
of
your
regard
i
can
accept
it
but
upon
one
condition
and
that
is
mrs
weeks
that
you
promise
me
that
no
matter
how
dark
the
night
how
stormy
the
sky
or
how
deep
the
waters
that
intervene
you
will
not
fail
to
send
for
me
in
your
hour
of
need
it
is
both
my
privilege
and
my
pleasure
and
i
should
not
rest
content
unless
i
knew
it
were
so
when
the
old
lady
had
promised
he
took
his
spread
and
going
out
to
his
horse
rode
away
to
his
own
home
where
he
related
this
incident
and
ended
with
now
i
want
this
put
on
my
bed
his
daughter
who
lovingly
humored
his
every
whim
immediately
complied
with
his
wish
and
from
that
day
to
the
hour
of
his
death
the
spread
was
never
out
of
his
service
one
of
the
most
pleasing
incidents
to
me
was
one
which
related
to
his
last
illness
and
death
always
during
his
later
years
when
he
felt
the
least
bit
ill
he
refused
to
prescribe
for
himself
saying
that
a
doctor
if
he
knew
anything
at
all
was
never
such
a
fool
as
to
take
any
of
his
own
medicine
instead
and
in
sequence
to
this
humorous
attitude
he
would
always
send
for
one
of
the
younger
men
of
the
vicinity
who
were
beginning
to
practice
here
one
for
instance
who
having
other
merits
needed
some
assurance
and
a
bit
of
superior
recognition
occasionally
to
help
him
along
on
this
occasion
he
called
in
a
very
sober
young
doctor
one
who
was
greatly
admired
but
had
very
little
practice
as
yet
and
saying
doctor
i
sick
today
lay
back
on
his
bed
and
waited
for
further
developments
the
latter
owing
to
gridley
great
repute
and
knowledge
was
very
much
flustered
so
much
so
that
he
scarcely
knew
what
to
do
well
doctor
he
finally
said
after
looking
at
his
tongue
taking
his
pulse
and
feeling
his
forehead
you
really
a
better
judge
of
your
own
condition
than
i
am
i
sure
what
do
you
think
i
ought
to
give
you
now
doctor
replied
gridley
sweetly
i
your
patient
and
you
my
doctor
i
would
prescribe
for
myself
for
anything
in
the
world
and
i
going
to
take
whatever
you
give
me
that
why
i
called
you
in
now
you
just
give
me
what
you
think
my
condition
requires
and
i
take
it
the
young
doctor
meditating
on
all
that
was
new
or
faddistic
decided
at
last
that
just
for
variation
sake
he
would
give
the
doctor
something
of
which
he
had
only
recently
heard
a
sample
of
which
he
had
with
him
and
which
had
been
acclaimed
in
the
medical
papers
as
very
effective
without
asking
the
doctor
whether
he
had
ever
heard
of
it
or
what
he
thought
he
merely
prescribed
it
well
now
i
like
that
commented
gridley
solemnly
i
never
heard
of
that
before
in
my
life
but
it
sounds
plausible
i
take
it
and
see
what
more
i
like
a
young
doctor
like
yourself
who
thinks
up
ways
of
his
own
and
according
to
his
daughter
he
did
take
it
and
was
helped
saying
always
that
what
young
doctors
needed
to
do
was
to
keep
abreast
of
the
latest
medical
developments
that
medicine
was
changing
and
perhaps
it
was
just
as
well
that
old
doctors
died
he
was
so
old
and
feeble
however
that
he
did
not
long
survive
and
when
the
time
came
was
really
glad
to
go
one
of
the
sweetest
and
most
interesting
of
all
his
mental
phases
was
as
i
have
reason
to
know
his
attitude
toward
the
problem
of
suffering
and
death
an
attitude
so
full
of
the
human
qualities
of
wonder
sympathy
tenderness
and
trust
that
he
could
scarcely
view
them
without
exhibiting
the
emotion
he
felt
he
was
a
constant
student
of
the
phenomena
of
dissolution
and
in
one
instance
calmly
declared
it
as
his
belief
that
when
a
man
was
dead
he
was
dead
and
that
was
the
end
of
him
consciously
at
other
times
he
modified
his
view
to
one
of
an
almost
prayerful
hope
and
in
reading
emily
brontë
somewhat
morbid
story
of
wuthering
heights
his
copy
of
which
i
long
had
in
my
possession
i
noted
that
he
had
annotated
numerous
passages
relative
to
death
and
a
future
life
with
interesting
comments
of
his
own
to
one
of
these
passages
which
reads
i
do
know
if
it
be
a
peculiarity
with
me
but
i
am
seldom
otherwise
than
happy
while
watching
in
the
chamber
of
death
provided
no
frenzied
or
despairing
mourner
shares
the
duty
with
me
i
see
a
repose
that
neither
earth
nor
hell
can
break
and
i
feel
an
assurance
of
the
endless
and
shadowless
hereafter
the
eternity
they
have
entered
where
life
is
boundless
in
its
duration
and
love
in
its
sympathy
and
joy
in
its
fullness
he
had
added
on
the
margin
how
often
i
have
felt
this
very
emotion
how
natural
i
know
it
to
be
and
what
a
consolation
in
the
thought
writing
a
final
prescription
for
a
young
clergyman
who
was
dying
and
for
whom
he
had
been
most
tenderly
solicitous
he
added
to
the
list
of
drugs
he
had
written
in
latin
the
lines
in
life
closing
hour
when
the
trembling
soul
flies
and
death
stills
the
heart
last
emotion
oh
then
may
the
angel
of
mercy
arise
like
a
star
on
eternity
ocean
when
he
himself
was
upon
his
he
greeted
his
old
friend
colonel
dyer
he
of
the
absent
overcoat
and
with
dyer
i
almost
gone
i
am
in
the
shadow
of
death
i
am
standing
upon
the
very
brink
i
can
not
see
clearly
i
can
not
speak
coherently
the
film
of
death
obstructs
my
sight
i
know
what
this
means
it
is
the
end
but
all
is
well
with
me
i
have
no
fear
i
have
said
and
done
things
that
would
have
been
better
left
unsaid
and
undone
but
i
have
never
willfully
wronged
a
man
in
my
life
i
have
no
concern
for
myself
i
am
concerned
only
for
those
i
leave
behind
i
never
saved
money
and
i
die
as
poor
as
when
i
was
born
we
do
not
know
what
there
is
in
the
future
now
shut
out
from
our
view
by
a
very
thin
veil
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
hand
somewhere
that
will
lead
us
safely
across
but
i
can
not
tell
no
one
can
tell
this
interesting
speech
made
scarcely
a
day
before
he
closed
his
eyes
in
death
was
typical
of
his
whole
generous
trustful
philosophical
point
of
view
if
there
be
green
fields
and
placid
waters
beyond
the
river
that
he
so
calmly
crossed
so
ran
an
editorial
in
the
local
county
paper
edited
by
one
of
his
most
ardent
admirers
reserved
for
those
who
believe
in
and
practice
upon
the
principle
of
unto
others
as
you
would
have
them
do
unto
you
then
this
samaritan
of
the
medical
profession
is
safe
from
all
harm
if
there
be
no
consciousness
but
only
a
mingling
of
that
which
was
gentleness
and
tenderness
here
with
the
earth
and
the
waters
then
the
greenness
of
the
one
and
the
sparkling
limpidity
of
the
other
are
richer
for
that
he
lived
and
wrought
and
returned
unto
them
so
trustingly
again
the
solid
i
met
him
in
connection
with
a
psychic
depression
which
only
partially
reflected
itself
in
my
physical
condition
i
might
almost
say
that
i
was
sick
spiritually
at
the
same
time
i
was
rather
strongly
imbued
with
a
contempt
for
him
and
his
cure
i
had
heard
of
him
for
years
to
begin
with
he
was
a
wrestler
of
repute
or
rather
retired
undefeated
champion
of
the
world
as
a
boy
i
had
known
that
he
had
toured
america
with
modjeska
as
charles
the
wrestler
in
as
you
like
it
before
or
after
that
he
had
trained
john
sullivan
the
champion
prize
fighter
of
his
day
for
one
of
his
most
successful
fights
and
that
at
a
time
when
sullivan
was
unfitted
to
fight
any
one
before
that
in
succession
from
youth
up
he
had
been
a
peasant
farmer
son
in
ireland
a
scullion
in
a
ship
kitchen
earning
his
way
to
america
a
beef
slinger
for
a
packing
company
a
cooks
assistant
and
waiter
in
a
bowery
restaurant
a
bouncer
in
a
saloon
a
rubber
down
at
prize
fights
a
policeman
a
private
in
the
army
during
the
civil
war
a
exhibition
wrestler
man
with
a
minstrel
company
later
a
circus
until
having
attained
his
greatest
fame
as
champion
wrestler
of
the
world
and
as
trainer
of
john
sullivan
he
finally
opened
a
sporting
sanitarium
in
some
county
in
upper
new
york
state
which
later
evolved
into
the
great
and
now
decidedly
fashionable
institution
in
westchester
near
new
york
it
has
always
been
interesting
to
me
to
see
in
what
awe
men
of
this
type
or
profession
are
held
by
many
in
the
more
intellectual
walks
of
life
as
well
as
by
those
whose
respectful
worship
is
less
surprising
those
who
revere
strength
agility
physical
courage
brute
or
otherwise
there
is
a
kind
of
retiring
worshipfulness
especially
in
men
and
children
of
the
lower
walks
for
this
type
which
must
be
flattering
in
the
extreme
however
in
so
far
as
culhane
was
concerned
at
this
time
the
case
was
different
whatever
he
had
been
in
his
youth
he
was
not
that
now
or
at
least
his
earlier
rawness
had
long
since
been
glazed
over
by
other
experiences
an
acquired
politeness
among
strangers
and
a
knowledge
of
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
permitted
him
to
associate
with
them
and
to
accept
if
not
copy
their
manners
and
to
a
certain
extent
their
customs
in
his
relations
with
them
literally
he
owned
hundreds
of
the
best
acres
of
the
land
about
him
in
one
of
the
most
fashionable
residence
sections
of
the
east
he
had
already
given
away
to
some
sisters
of
mercy
a
great
estate
in
northern
new
york
his
stables
contained
every
type
of
fashionable
vehicle
and
stalled
and
fed
sixty
or
seventy
of
the
worst
horses
purposely
so
chosen
for
the
use
of
his
guests
men
of
all
professions
visited
his
place
paid
him
gladly
the
six
hundred
dollars
in
advance
which
he
asked
for
the
course
of
six
weeks
training
and
brought
or
attempted
to
their
own
cars
and
retinues
which
they
lodged
in
the
vicinity
but
could
not
use
i
myself
was
introduced
or
rather
foisted
upon
him
by
my
dear
brother
whose
friend
if
not
crony
if
such
a
thing
could
have
been
said
to
exist
in
his
life
he
was
i
was
taken
to
him
in
a
very
somber
and
depressed
mood
and
left
he
rarely
if
ever
received
guests
in
person
or
at
once
on
the
way
and
before
i
had
been
introduced
i
was
instructed
by
my
good
brother
as
to
his
moods
methods
airs
and
tricks
supposed
or
rumored
to
be
so
beneficial
in
so
many
cases
they
were
very
rough
purposely
so
the
day
i
arrived
and
before
i
saw
him
i
was
very
much
impressed
with
the
simplicity
yet
distinction
of
the
inn
or
sanitarium
or
repair
shop
as
subsequently
i
learned
he
was
accustomed
to
refer
to
it
perched
upon
a
rise
of
ground
and
commanding
a
quite
wonderful
panorama
it
was
spring
and
quite
warm
and
bright
the
cropped
enclosure
which
surrounded
it
a
great
square
of
green
fenced
with
high
privet
was
good
to
look
upon
level
and
smooth
the
house
standing
in
the
center
of
this
was
large
and
oblong
and
gray
with
very
simple
french
windows
reaching
to
the
floor
and
great
wide
balustraded
balconies
reaching
out
from
the
second
floor
shaded
with
awnings
and
set
with
rockers
the
land
on
which
this
inn
stood
sloped
very
gradually
to
the
sound
miles
away
to
the
southeast
and
the
spires
of
churches
and
the
gables
of
villages
rising
in
between
as
well
as
various
sails
upon
the
water
were
no
small
portion
of
its
charm
to
the
west
for
a
score
of
miles
the
earth
rose
and
fell
in
undulating
beauty
and
here
again
the
roofs
and
spires
of
nearby
villages
might
in
fair
weather
be
seen
nestling
peacefully
among
the
trees
due
south
there
was
a
suggestion
of
water
and
some
peculiar
configuration
which
by
day
seemed
to
have
no
significance
other
than
that
which
attached
to
the
vague
outlines
of
a
distant
landscape
by
night
however
the
soft
glow
emanating
from
myriads
of
lights
identified
it
as
the
body
and
length
of
the
merry
new
york
northward
the
green
waves
repeated
themselves
unendingly
until
they
passed
into
a
dim
haze
interiorly
as
i
learned
later
this
place
was
most
cleverly
and
sensibly
arranged
for
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
intended
it
was
airy
and
with
on
the
ground
floor
a
great
gymnasium
containing
outside
of
an
alcove
at
one
end
where
hung
four
or
five
punching
bags
only
medicine
balls
at
the
other
end
was
an
office
or
baggage
or
and
locker
and
to
the
east
at
the
center
extended
a
wing
containing
a
number
of
a
lounging
room
and
sun
parlor
on
the
second
floor
on
either
side
of
a
wide
airy
hall
which
ran
from
an
immense
library
billiard
and
at
one
end
to
culhane
private
suite
at
the
other
were
two
rows
of
bedrooms
perhaps
a
hundred
all
told
which
gave
in
turn
each
one
upon
either
side
on
to
the
balconies
previously
mentioned
these
rooms
were
arranged
somewhat
like
the
rooms
of
a
passenger
steamer
with
its
center
aisle
and
its
outer
decks
and
doors
opening
upon
it
in
another
wing
on
the
ground
floor
were
kitchens
servants
quarters
and
what
not
else
across
the
immense
lawn
or
campus
to
the
east
to
the
sanitarium
stood
a
rather
grandiose
stable
almost
as
impressive
as
the
main
building
about
the
place
and
always
more
or
less
in
evidence
were
servants
ostlers
and
always
a
decidedly
large
company
of
men
of
practically
all
professions
ages
and
one
might
almost
say
nationalities
that
is
as
nationalities
are
represented
in
america
by
first
and
second
generations
the
day
i
arrived
i
did
not
see
my
prospective
host
or
manager
or
trainer
for
an
hour
or
two
after
i
came
being
allowed
to
wait
about
until
the
very
peculiar
temperament
which
he
possessed
would
permit
him
to
come
and
see
me
when
he
did
show
up
a
more
savage
and
yet
animal
in
clothes
i
have
never
seen
he
was
really
very
princely
in
build
and
manner
shapely
and
grand
like
those
portraits
that
have
come
down
to
us
of
richelieu
and
the
duc
de
guise
riding
trousers
bright
red
waistcoat
check
riding
coat
brown
leather
riding
boots
and
leggings
with
the
essential
spurs
and
a
riding
quirt
and
yet
really
at
that
moment
he
reminded
me
not
so
much
of
a
man
in
his
supremely
riding
costume
as
of
a
tiger
or
a
very
ferocious
and
yet
at
times
purring
cat
beautifully
dressed
as
in
our
storybooks
a
kind
of
tiger
in
collar
and
boots
he
was
so
lithe
silent
in
his
tread
in
his
hard
clear
gray
animal
eyes
was
that
swift
incisive
restless
searching
glance
which
sometimes
troubles
us
in
the
presence
of
animals
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
he
was
all
of
sixty
as
i
had
been
told
he
looked
the
very
man
of
fifty
or
less
the
short
trimmed
mustache
and
goatee
which
he
wore
were
gray
and
added
to
his
grand
air
his
hair
cut
a
close
pompadour
the
ends
of
his
heavy
eyebrow
hairs
turned
upward
gave
him
a
still
more
distinguished
air
he
looked
very
virile
very
intelligent
very
indifferent
intolerant
and
even
threatening
well
he
exclaimed
on
sight
you
wish
to
see
me
i
gave
him
my
name
yes
that
so
your
brother
spoke
to
me
about
you
well
take
a
seat
you
will
be
looked
after
he
walked
off
and
after
an
hour
or
so
i
was
still
waiting
for
what
i
scarcely
knew
a
room
something
to
eat
possibly
some
one
to
speak
a
friendly
word
to
me
but
no
one
did
while
i
was
waiting
in
this
rather
nondescript
antechamber
hung
with
hats
caps
riding
whips
and
gauntlets
i
had
an
opportunity
to
study
some
of
the
men
with
whom
presumably
i
was
to
live
for
a
number
of
weeks
it
was
between
two
and
three
in
the
afternoon
and
many
of
them
were
idling
about
in
pairs
or
threes
talking
reading
all
in
rather
commonplace
athletic
costumes
soft
woolen
shirts
knee
trousers
stockings
and
running
or
walking
shoes
they
were
in
the
main
evidently
of
the
learned
professions
or
the
arts
doctors
lawyers
preachers
actors
writers
with
a
goodly
sprinkling
of
merchants
manufacturers
and
young
and
society
men
as
well
as
politicians
and
monied
idlers
generally
a
little
the
worse
for
their
pleasures
or
weaknesses
a
distinguished
judge
of
one
of
the
superior
courts
of
new
york
and
an
actor
known
everywhere
in
the
world
were
instantly
recognized
by
me
others
as
i
was
subsequently
informed
were
related
by
birth
or
achievement
to
some
one
fact
or
another
of
public
significance
the
reason
for
the
presence
of
so
many
people
rather
above
than
under
the
average
in
intellect
lay
as
i
came
to
believe
later
in
their
ability
or
that
of
some
one
connected
with
them
to
sincerely
appreciate
or
to
at
least
be
amused
and
benefited
by
the
somewhat
different
theory
of
physical
repair
which
the
lord
of
the
manor
had
invented
or
for
which
at
least
he
had
become
famous
i
have
remarked
that
i
was
not
inclined
to
be
impressed
sanitariums
with
their
isms
and
theories
did
not
appeal
to
me
however
as
i
was
waiting
here
an
incident
occurred
which
stuck
in
my
mind
a
smart
conveyance
drove
up
occupied
by
a
singularly
lean
and
individual
who
after
looking
about
him
expecting
some
one
to
come
out
to
him
no
doubt
clambered
cautiously
out
and
after
seeing
that
his
various
grips
and
one
trunk
were
properly
deposited
on
the
gravel
square
outside
paid
and
feed
his
driver
then
walked
in
and
remarked
ah
where
is
mr
culhane
i
do
know
sir
i
replied
being
the
only
one
present
he
was
here
but
he
gone
i
presume
some
one
will
show
up
presently
he
walked
up
and
down
a
little
while
and
then
added
um
rather
peculiar
method
of
receiving
one
is
it
i
wired
him
i
be
here
he
walked
restlessly
and
almost
waspishly
to
and
fro
looking
out
of
the
window
at
times
at
others
commenting
on
the
rather
casual
character
of
it
all
i
agreed
thus
some
fifteen
minutes
having
gone
by
without
any
one
approaching
us
and
occasional
servants
or
guests
passing
through
the
room
or
being
seen
in
the
offing
without
even
so
much
as
vouchsafing
a
word
or
appearing
to
be
interested
in
us
the
new
arrival
grew
excited
this
is
very
unusual
he
fumed
walking
up
and
down
i
wired
him
only
three
hours
ago
i
been
here
now
fully
of
an
hour
a
most
method
of
doing
business
i
should
say
presently
our
stern
host
returned
he
seemed
to
be
going
somewhere
to
be
nowise
interested
in
us
yet
into
our
presence
probably
into
the
consciousness
of
this
new
guest
he
carried
that
air
of
savage
strength
and
indifference
eyeing
the
stranger
quite
sharply
and
making
no
effort
to
apologize
for
our
long
wait
you
wish
to
see
me
he
inquired
brusquely
once
more
like
a
wasp
the
stranger
was
vibrant
with
rage
plainly
he
felt
himself
insulted
or
terribly
underrated
are
you
mr
culhane
he
asked
crisply
yes
i
am
squiers
he
exclaimed
i
wired
you
from
buffalo
and
ordered
a
room
this
last
with
an
irritated
wave
of
the
hand
oh
no
you
did
order
any
room
replied
the
host
sourly
and
with
an
obvious
desire
to
show
his
indifference
and
contempt
even
you
wired
to
know
if
you
a
room
he
paused
the
temperature
seemed
to
drop
perceptibly
the
prospective
guest
seemed
to
realize
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
somewhere
had
been
misinformed
as
to
conditions
here
oh
um
ah
yes
well
have
you
a
room
i
do
know
i
doubt
it
we
do
take
every
one
his
eyes
seemed
to
bore
into
the
interior
of
his
guest
well
but
i
was
told
my
friend
x
the
stranger
began
a
rapid
explanation
of
how
he
came
to
be
here
i
do
know
anything
about
your
friend
or
what
he
told
you
if
he
told
you
you
could
order
a
room
by
telegraph
he
mistaken
anyhow
not
dealing
with
him
but
with
me
now
that
you
here
though
if
you
want
to
sit
down
and
rest
yourself
a
little
i
see
what
i
can
do
for
you
i
ca
decide
now
whether
i
can
let
you
stay
you
have
to
wait
a
while
he
turned
and
walked
off
the
other
stared
well
he
commented
to
me
after
a
time
walking
and
twisting
if
a
man
wants
to
come
here
i
suppose
he
has
to
put
up
with
such
things
but
it
certainly
unusual
is
it
he
sat
down
wilted
and
waited
later
a
clerk
in
charge
of
the
registry
book
took
us
in
hand
and
then
i
heard
him
explaining
that
his
lungs
were
not
in
good
shape
he
had
come
a
long
way
denver
i
believe
he
had
heard
that
all
one
needed
to
do
was
to
wire
especially
one
in
his
circumstances
some
people
think
that
way
solemnly
commented
the
clerk
but
they
do
know
culhane
he
does
about
as
he
pleases
in
these
matters
he
does
do
this
any
more
to
make
money
but
rather
to
amuse
himself
i
think
he
always
has
more
applicants
than
he
accepts
i
began
to
see
a
light
perhaps
there
was
something
to
this
place
after
all
i
did
not
even
partially
sense
the
drift
of
the
situation
though
until
bedtime
when
after
having
been
served
a
very
frugal
meal
and
shown
to
my
very
simple
room
a
kind
of
cell
promptly
at
nine
lights
were
turned
off
i
lit
a
small
candle
and
was
looking
over
some
things
which
i
had
placed
in
a
grip
when
i
heard
a
voice
in
the
hall
outside
candles
out
please
candles
out
all
guests
in
bed
then
it
came
to
me
that
a
very
rigorous
régime
was
being
enforced
here
the
next
morning
as
i
was
still
soundly
sleeping
at
a
loud
rap
sounded
at
my
door
the
night
before
i
had
noticed
above
my
bed
a
framed
sign
which
read
guests
must
be
dressed
in
running
trunks
shoes
and
sweater
and
appear
in
the
gymnasium
by
six
sharp
gymnasium
at
six
gymnasium
at
six
a
voice
echoed
down
the
hall
i
bounced
out
of
bed
something
about
the
very
air
of
the
place
made
me
feel
that
it
was
dangerous
to
attempt
to
trifle
with
the
routine
here
the
eyes
of
my
host
did
not
appeal
to
me
as
retaining
any
softer
ray
in
them
for
me
than
for
others
i
had
paid
my
six
hundred
i
had
better
earn
it
i
was
down
in
the
great
room
in
my
trunks
sweater
running
shoes
in
less
than
five
minutes
and
that
room
by
that
time
as
odd
a
company
of
people
as
i
have
ever
seen
in
a
gymnasium
had
already
begun
to
assemble
the
leanness
the
osseosity
the
grandiloquent
whiskers
parted
in
the
middle
the
mustachios
the
goatees
the
fat
stomachs
the
protuberant
knees
the
thin
arms
the
bald
or
pates
the
spectacles
or
horn
glasses
or
laid
aside
a
few
moments
later
as
the
exercises
began
youth
and
strength
in
the
pink
of
condition
when
clad
only
in
trunks
a
sweater
and
running
shoes
are
none
too
acceptable
but
middle
age
and
out
in
the
world
i
reflected
rather
sadly
they
all
wore
the
best
of
clothes
had
their
cars
servants
city
and
country
houses
perhaps
their
factories
employees
institutions
ridiculous
pitiful
as
lymphatic
and
flabby
as
oysters
without
their
shells
myself
included
it
was
really
painful
even
as
i
meditated
however
i
was
advised
by
many
who
saw
that
i
was
a
stranger
to
choose
a
partner
any
partner
for
medicine
ball
practice
for
it
might
save
me
being
taken
or
called
by
i
hastened
so
to
do
even
as
we
were
assembling
or
beginning
to
practice
keeping
two
or
three
light
medicine
balls
going
between
each
pair
our
host
entered
that
iron
man
that
mount
of
brawn
in
his
cowled
he
looked
more
like
some
great
monk
or
fighting
abbot
of
the
medieval
years
than
a
trainer
he
walked
to
the
center
hung
up
his
cowl
and
revealed
himself
lithe
and
and
costumed
like
ourselves
but
how
much
more
attractive
as
he
strode
about
his
legs
lean
and
sturdy
his
chest
full
his
arms
powerful
and
graceful
at
once
he
seized
a
large
medicine
ball
as
had
all
the
others
and
calling
a
name
to
which
responded
a
lean
whiskerando
with
a
pate
thin
legs
and
arms
and
very
much
caricatured
i
presume
by
the
wearing
of
trunks
and
sweater
taking
his
place
opposite
the
host
he
was
immediately
made
the
recipient
of
a
volley
of
balls
and
epithets
hurry
up
now
faster
ah
come
on
put
the
ball
back
to
me
put
the
ball
back
do
you
want
to
keep
it
all
day
great
god
what
are
you
standing
there
for
what
are
you
standing
there
for
what
do
you
think
you
doing
drinking
tea
come
on
i
have
all
morning
for
you
alone
move
move
you
ham
you
call
yourself
an
editor
why
you
could
edit
a
handbill
you
ca
even
throw
a
ball
straight
throw
it
straight
throw
it
straight
for
christ
sake
where
do
you
think
i
am
out
in
the
office
throw
it
straight
hell
and
all
the
time
one
and
another
ball
grabbed
from
anywhere
for
the
floor
was
always
littered
with
them
would
be
thrown
in
the
victim
direction
and
before
he
could
well
appreciate
what
was
happening
to
him
he
was
being
struck
once
in
the
neck
and
again
on
the
chest
by
the
rapidly
delivered
six
ounce
balls
two
of
which
at
least
he
and
the
host
were
supposed
to
keep
in
constant
motion
between
them
later
a
ball
striking
him
in
the
stomach
he
emitted
a
weak
ooph
and
laying
his
hands
over
the
affected
part
ceased
all
effort
at
this
the
master
of
the
situation
only
smirked
on
him
leoninely
and
holding
up
a
ball
as
if
to
throw
it
continued
what
the
matter
with
you
now
come
on
what
do
you
want
to
stop
for
what
do
you
want
to
stand
there
for
you
not
hurt
how
do
you
expect
to
get
anywhere
if
you
ca
keep
two
silly
little
balls
like
these
going
between
us
there
had
probably
been
six
or
eight
here
i
am
sixty
and
you
forty
and
you
ca
even
keep
up
with
me
and
you
pretend
to
give
the
general
public
advice
on
life
well
go
on
god
pity
the
public
is
all
i
say
and
he
dismissed
him
calling
out
another
name
now
came
a
fat
bald
soul
with
dewlaps
and
a
protruding
stomach
who
later
i
learned
was
a
manufacturer
of
clothing
six
hundred
employees
under
him
down
in
health
and
nerves
really
all
shot
to
pieces
physically
plainly
nervous
at
the
sound
of
his
name
he
puffed
quickly
into
position
grabbing
wildly
after
the
purposely
eccentric
throws
which
his
host
made
and
which
kept
him
running
to
left
and
right
in
an
all
but
panicky
mood
move
move
insisted
our
host
as
before
and
if
anything
more
irritably
say
you
work
like
a
crab
what
a
motion
if
you
had
more
head
and
less
guts
you
could
do
this
better
a
fine
specimen
you
are
this
is
what
comes
of
riding
about
in
taxis
and
eating
midnight
suppers
instead
of
exercising
wake
up
wake
up
a
belt
would
have
kept
your
stomach
in
long
ago
a
little
less
food
and
less
sleep
and
you
have
any
fat
cheeks
even
your
hair
might
stay
on
wake
up
wake
up
what
do
you
want
to
do
die
and
as
he
talked
he
pitched
the
balls
so
quickly
that
his
victim
looked
at
times
as
though
he
were
about
to
weep
his
physical
deficiencies
were
all
too
plain
in
every
way
he
was
generally
obese
and
looked
as
though
he
might
drop
his
face
a
flaming
red
his
hands
trembling
and
missing
when
a
well
go
on
sounded
and
a
third
victim
was
called
this
time
it
was
a
actor
who
responded
a
star
rather
spry
and
well
set
up
but
still
nervous
for
he
realized
quite
well
what
was
before
him
he
had
been
here
for
weeks
and
was
in
pretty
fair
trim
but
still
he
was
plainly
on
edge
he
ran
and
began
receiving
and
tossing
as
swiftly
as
he
could
but
as
with
the
others
so
it
was
his
turn
now
to
be
given
such
a
grilling
and
as
falls
to
few
of
us
in
this
world
let
alone
among
the
successful
in
the
realm
of
the
footlights
say
you
not
an
actor
you
a
woman
you
a
stewed
onion
move
move
come
on
come
on
look
at
those
motions
now
will
you
look
at
that
one
arm
up
where
do
you
suppose
the
ball
is
on
the
ceiling
it
not
a
lamp
come
on
come
on
it
a
wonder
when
you
killed
as
hamlet
that
you
do
stay
dead
you
are
you
really
dead
now
you
know
move
move
and
so
it
would
go
until
finally
the
poor
thespian
no
match
for
his
master
and
beset
by
flying
balls
landing
upon
his
neck
ear
stomach
finally
gave
up
and
cried
well
i
ca
go
any
faster
than
i
can
can
i
i
ca
do
any
more
than
i
can
ah
go
on
go
back
into
the
chorus
called
his
host
who
now
abandoned
him
get
somebody
from
the
baby
class
to
play
marbles
with
you
and
he
called
another
by
now
as
may
well
be
imagined
i
was
fairly
stirred
up
as
to
the
probabilities
of
the
situation
he
might
call
me
the
man
who
was
playing
opposite
me
a
small
decayed
person
who
chose
me
i
think
because
he
knew
i
was
new
innocuous
and
probably
awkward
seemed
to
realize
my
thoughts
as
well
as
his
own
by
lively
exercise
with
me
he
was
doing
his
utmost
to
create
an
impression
of
great
and
valuable
effort
here
come
on
let
play
fast
so
he
wo
notice
us
he
said
most
pathetically
at
one
point
you
would
have
thought
i
had
known
him
all
my
life
but
he
did
call
us
not
this
morning
at
any
rate
whether
owing
to
our
efforts
or
the
fact
that
i
at
least
was
too
insignificant
too
obscure
we
escaped
he
did
reach
me
however
on
the
fourth
or
fifth
day
and
no
spindling
failure
could
have
done
worse
i
was
struck
and
tripped
and
pounded
until
i
all
but
fell
prone
upon
the
floor
half
convinced
that
i
was
being
killed
but
i
was
not
i
was
merely
sent
stumbling
and
drooping
back
to
the
sidelines
to
recover
while
he
tortured
some
one
else
but
the
names
he
called
me
the
comments
on
my
none
too
smoothly
articulated
bones
and
my
alleged
mind
as
in
my
schooldays
when
a
laggard
in
the
fierce
and
seemingly
malevolent
atmosphere
in
which
i
was
taught
my
abc
i
crept
shamefacedly
and
beaten
from
the
scene
it
was
in
the
adjoining
bathroom
where
the
host
daily
personally
superintended
the
ablutions
of
his
guests
that
even
more
of
his
remarkable
method
was
revealed
here
a
goodly
portion
of
the
force
of
his
method
was
his
skill
in
removing
any
sense
of
ability
agility
authority
or
worth
from
those
with
whom
he
dealt
apparently
to
him
in
his
strength
and
energy
they
were
all
children
weaklings
failures
numbskulls
no
matter
what
they
might
be
in
the
world
outside
they
had
no
understanding
of
the
most
important
of
their
possessions
their
bodies
and
here
again
even
more
than
in
the
gymnasium
they
were
at
the
disadvantage
of
feeling
themselves
spectacles
for
here
they
were
naked
however
grand
an
osseous
leathery
lawyer
or
judge
or
doctor
or
politician
or
society
man
may
look
out
in
the
world
addressing
a
jury
or
a
crowd
or
walking
in
some
favorite
place
glistening
in
his
raiment
here
whiskered
thin
of
legs
arms
and
neck
with
bulging
brow
and
stripped
not
only
of
his
gown
but
everything
else
this
side
of
his
skin
well
draw
your
own
conclusion
for
after
performing
certain
additional
exercises
one
hundred
times
up
on
your
toes
one
hundred
times
if
you
could
squatting
to
your
knees
one
hundred
times
throwing
your
arms
out
straight
before
you
from
your
chest
or
up
from
your
shoulders
or
out
at
right
angles
right
and
left
from
your
body
and
back
to
your
hips
until
your
fingers
touched
and
the
sweat
once
more
ran
you
were
then
ready
to
be
told
for
once
in
your
life
how
to
swiftly
and
agilely
take
a
bath
well
now
you
ready
are
you
this
to
a
noble
jurist
who
like
myself
perhaps
had
arrived
only
the
day
before
come
on
now
now
you
have
just
ten
seconds
in
which
to
jump
under
the
water
and
get
yourself
wet
all
over
twenty
seconds
in
which
to
jump
out
and
soap
yourself
thoroughly
ten
seconds
in
which
to
get
back
in
again
and
rinse
off
all
the
soap
and
twenty
seconds
in
which
to
rub
and
dry
your
skin
thoroughly
now
start
the
distinguished
jurist
began
but
instead
of
following
the
advice
given
him
for
rapid
action
huddled
himself
in
a
shivering
position
under
the
water
and
stood
all
but
inert
despite
the
previous
explanation
of
the
host
that
the
sole
method
of
escaping
the
weakening
influence
of
cold
water
was
by
counteracting
it
with
activity
when
it
would
prove
beneficial
he
was
such
a
noble
stalky
bony
affair
his
gold
eyeglasses
laid
aside
for
the
time
being
his
tweeds
and
carefully
laundered
linen
all
dispensed
with
during
his
stay
here
as
he
came
meticulously
and
gingerly
and
quite
undone
by
his
efforts
from
under
the
water
where
he
had
been
most
roughly
urged
by
culhane
i
hoped
that
he
and
not
i
would
continue
to
be
seized
upon
by
this
savage
who
seemed
to
take
infinite
delight
in
disturbing
the
social
and
intellectual
poise
of
us
all
soap
yourself
exclaimed
the
latter
most
harshly
now
that
the
bather
was
out
in
the
room
once
more
soap
your
chest
soap
your
stomach
soap
your
arms
damn
it
soap
your
arms
and
do
rub
them
all
day
either
now
soap
your
legs
damn
it
soap
your
legs
do
you
know
how
to
soap
your
legs
do
stand
there
all
day
soap
your
legs
now
turn
round
and
soap
your
back
soap
your
back
for
christ
sake
soap
your
back
do
it
quick
quick
now
come
back
under
the
water
again
and
see
if
you
can
get
it
off
do
act
as
though
you
were
cold
molasses
move
move
lord
you
act
as
though
you
had
all
day
as
though
you
had
never
taken
a
bath
in
your
life
i
never
saw
such
an
old
poke
you
come
up
here
and
expect
me
to
do
some
things
for
you
and
then
you
stand
around
as
though
you
were
made
of
bone
quick
now
move
the
noble
jurist
did
as
demanded
that
is
as
quickly
as
he
could
only
the
mental
inadequacy
and
feebleness
which
he
displayed
before
all
the
others
of
course
was
the
worst
of
his
cruel
treatment
here
and
in
this
as
in
many
instances
it
cut
deep
so
often
it
was
the
shock
to
one
dignity
more
than
anything
else
which
hurt
so
to
be
called
an
old
poke
when
one
was
perhaps
a
grave
and
reverent
senior
or
to
be
told
that
one
was
made
of
bone
when
one
was
a
famous
doctor
or
merchant
once
under
the
water
this
particular
specimen
had
begun
by
nervously
rubbing
his
hands
and
face
in
order
to
get
the
soap
off
and
when
shouted
at
and
abused
for
that
had
then
turned
his
attention
to
one
other
spot
the
back
of
his
left
forearm
mine
host
seemed
enraged
well
well
he
exclaimed
irascibly
watching
him
as
might
a
hawk
are
you
going
to
spend
all
day
rubbing
that
one
spot
for
god
sake
do
you
know
enough
to
rub
your
whole
body
and
get
out
from
under
the
water
move
move
rub
your
chest
rub
your
belly
hell
rub
your
back
rub
your
toes
and
get
out
when
routed
from
the
ludicrous
effort
of
vigorously
rubbing
one
spot
he
was
continually
being
driven
on
to
some
other
as
though
his
body
were
some
vast
complex
machine
which
he
had
never
rightly
understood
before
he
was
very
much
flustered
of
course
and
seemed
wholly
unable
to
grasp
how
it
was
done
let
alone
please
his
exacting
host
come
on
insisted
the
latter
finally
and
wearily
get
out
from
under
the
water
a
lot
you
know
about
washing
yourself
for
a
man
who
has
been
on
the
bench
for
fifteen
years
you
the
dullest
person
i
ever
met
if
you
bathe
like
that
at
home
how
do
you
keep
clean
come
on
out
and
dry
yourself
the
distinguished
victim
drying
himself
rather
ruefully
on
an
exceedingly
rough
towel
looked
a
little
weary
and
disgusted
such
language
some
one
afterwards
said
he
said
to
some
one
else
he
not
used
to
dealing
with
gentlemen
that
plain
the
man
talks
like
a
blackguard
and
to
think
we
pay
for
such
things
well
well
i
not
stand
it
i
afraid
i
had
about
enough
it
positively
revolting
positively
revolting
but
he
stayed
on
just
the
same
second
thoughts
a
good
breakfast
his
own
physical
needs
at
any
rate
weeks
later
he
was
still
there
and
in
much
better
shape
physically
if
not
mentally
about
the
second
or
third
day
i
witnessed
another
such
spectacle
which
made
me
laugh
only
not
in
my
host
presence
nay
verily
for
into
this
same
chamber
had
come
another
distinguished
personage
a
lawyer
or
society
man
i
could
tell
which
who
was
washing
himself
rather
leisurely
as
was
the
prescribed
way
when
suddenly
he
was
spied
by
mine
host
who
was
invariably
instructing
some
one
in
this
swift
or
less
system
now
he
eyed
the
operation
narrowly
for
a
few
seconds
then
came
over
and
exclaimed
wash
your
toes
ca
you
wash
your
toes
ca
you
wash
your
toes
the
skilled
gentleman
realizing
that
he
was
now
living
under
very
different
conditions
from
those
to
which
presumably
he
was
accustomed
reached
down
and
began
to
rub
the
tops
of
his
toes
but
without
any
desire
apparently
to
widen
the
operation
here
called
the
host
this
time
much
more
sharply
i
said
wash
your
toes
not
the
outside
of
them
soap
them
do
you
know
how
to
wash
your
toes
yet
you
old
enough
god
knows
wash
between
wash
under
certainly
i
know
how
to
wash
my
toes
replied
the
other
irritably
and
straightening
up
and
what
more
i
like
you
to
know
that
i
am
a
gentleman
well
then
if
you
a
gentleman
retorted
the
other
you
ought
to
know
how
to
wash
your
toes
wash
and
do
talk
back
pah
exclaimed
the
bather
now
looking
twice
as
ridiculous
as
before
i
not
used
to
having
such
language
addressed
to
me
i
ca
help
that
said
culhane
if
you
knew
how
to
wash
your
toes
perhaps
you
would
have
to
have
such
language
addressed
to
you
oh
hell
fumed
the
other
this
is
positively
outrageous
i
leave
the
place
by
george
very
well
rejoined
the
other
only
before
you
go
you
have
to
wash
your
toes
and
he
did
the
host
standing
by
and
calmly
watching
the
performance
until
it
was
finally
completed
it
was
just
this
atmosphere
which
made
the
place
the
most
astonishing
in
which
i
have
ever
been
it
seemed
to
be
drawing
the
celebrated
and
the
successful
as
a
magnet
might
iron
and
yet
it
offered
conditions
which
one
might
presume
they
would
be
most
opposed
to
no
one
here
was
really
any
one
however
much
he
might
be
outside
our
host
was
all
he
had
a
great
blazing
personality
which
dominated
everybody
and
he
did
not
hesitate
to
show
before
one
and
all
that
he
did
so
do
breakfast
here
consisted
of
a
cereal
a
chop
and
coffee
plentiful
but
very
plain
i
thought
after
breakfast
between
and
eleven
we
were
free
to
do
as
we
chose
write
letters
pack
our
bags
if
we
were
leaving
do
up
our
laundry
to
be
sent
out
read
or
merely
sit
about
at
eleven
or
according
to
the
nature
of
the
exercise
one
had
to
join
a
group
either
one
that
was
to
do
the
long
or
short
block
as
they
were
known
here
or
one
that
was
to
ride
horseback
all
exercises
being
so
timed
that
by
proper
execution
one
would
arrive
at
the
bathroom
door
in
time
to
bathe
dress
and
take
ten
minutes
rest
before
luncheon
these
exercises
were
simple
enough
in
themselves
consisting
as
they
did
in
the
case
of
the
long
and
the
short
blocks
the
long
block
seven
the
short
four
miles
in
length
of
our
walking
or
walking
and
running
betimes
about
or
over
courses
laid
up
hill
and
down
dale
over
or
through
unpaved
mudroads
in
many
instances
along
dry
or
wet
beds
of
brooks
or
streams
and
across
stony
or
weedy
fields
often
still
damp
with
dew
or
the
spring
rains
but
in
most
cases
when
people
had
not
taken
any
regular
exercise
for
a
long
time
this
was
by
no
means
easy
the
first
day
i
thought
i
should
never
make
it
and
i
was
by
no
means
a
poor
walker
others
the
new
ones
especially
often
gave
out
and
had
to
be
sent
for
or
came
in
an
hour
late
to
be
most
severely
and
irritatingly
ragged
by
the
host
he
seemed
to
all
but
despise
weakness
and
had
apparently
a
thousand
disagreeable
ways
of
showing
it
if
you
want
to
see
what
poor
bags
of
mush
some
people
can
become
he
once
said
in
regard
to
some
poor
specimen
who
had
seemingly
had
great
difficulty
in
doing
the
short
block
look
at
this
here
comes
a
man
sent
out
to
do
four
measly
country
miles
in
fifty
minutes
and
look
at
him
you
think
he
was
going
to
die
he
probably
thinks
so
himself
in
new
york
he
do
seventeen
miles
in
a
night
running
from
barroom
to
barroom
or
one
lobster
palace
to
another
that
a
good
name
for
them
by
the
way
and
never
say
a
word
but
out
here
in
the
country
with
plenty
of
fresh
air
and
a
night
rest
and
a
good
breakfast
he
even
do
four
miles
in
fifty
minutes
think
of
it
and
he
probably
thinks
of
himself
as
a
man
boasts
before
his
friends
or
his
wife
anyhow
lord
a
day
or
two
later
there
arrived
here
a
certain
major
of
the
united
states
army
a
large
rather
pompous
person
of
about
or
who
from
taking
his
ease
in
one
sinecure
and
another
had
finally
reached
the
place
where
he
was
unable
to
endure
certain
tests
or
he
thought
so
which
were
about
to
be
made
with
a
view
to
retiring
certain
officers
grown
fat
in
the
service
as
he
explained
to
culhane
and
the
latter
was
always
open
and
ribald
afterward
in
his
comments
on
those
who
offered
explanations
of
any
kind
his
plan
was
to
take
the
course
here
in
order
to
be
able
to
make
the
difficult
tests
later
culhane
resented
this
i
think
he
resented
people
using
him
or
his
methods
to
get
anywhere
do
anything
more
in
life
than
he
could
do
and
yet
he
received
them
he
felt
and
i
think
in
the
main
that
he
was
right
that
they
looked
down
on
him
because
of
his
lowly
birth
and
purely
material
and
mechanical
career
and
yet
having
attained
some
distinction
by
it
he
could
not
forego
this
work
which
raised
him
in
a
way
to
a
position
of
dominance
over
these
people
now
the
sight
of
presumably
so
efficient
a
person
in
need
of
aid
or
exercise
to
be
built
up
was
all
that
was
required
to
spur
him
on
to
the
most
waspish
or
wolfish
attitude
imaginable
in
part
at
least
he
argued
i
think
for
in
the
last
analysis
he
was
really
too
wise
and
experienced
to
take
any
such
petty
view
although
there
is
a
subconscious
motivating
impulse
in
all
our
views
that
here
he
was
an
fighter
bouncer
trainer
and
here
was
this
grand
major
trained
at
west
point
who
actually
did
know
any
more
about
life
or
how
to
take
care
of
his
body
than
to
be
compelled
to
come
here
broken
down
at
whereas
he
because
of
his
stamina
and
spartan
energy
had
been
able
to
survive
in
perfect
condition
until
sixty
and
was
now
in
a
position
to
rebuild
all
these
men
and
wastrels
and
to
control
this
great
institution
and
to
a
certain
extent
he
was
right
although
he
seemed
to
forget
or
not
to
know
that
he
was
not
the
creator
of
his
own
great
strength
by
any
means
impulses
and
tendencies
over
which
he
had
no
control
having
arranged
for
that
however
that
may
be
here
was
the
major
a
suppliant
for
his
services
and
here
was
he
culhane
and
although
the
major
was
paying
well
for
his
minute
room
and
his
probably
greatly
decreased
diet
still
culhane
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
make
a
show
of
him
to
picture
him
as
the
more
or
less
pathetic
example
that
he
was
in
order
perhaps
that
he
culhane
might
shine
by
contrast
thus
on
the
first
day
having
sent
him
around
the
short
block
with
the
others
it
was
found
at
twelve
when
the
joggers
were
expected
to
return
and
again
at
when
they
were
supposed
to
take
their
places
at
the
luncheon
table
that
the
heavy
major
had
not
arrived
he
had
been
seen
and
passed
by
all
of
course
after
the
first
mile
or
two
probably
he
had
given
out
and
was
making
his
way
as
best
he
might
up
hill
and
down
dale
or
along
some
more
direct
road
to
the
shop
or
maybe
he
had
dropped
out
entirely
as
some
did
via
a
kindly
truck
or
farmer
wagon
and
was
on
his
way
to
the
nearest
railway
station
at
any
rate
as
culhane
sat
down
at
his
very
small
private
table
which
stood
in
the
center
of
the
and
far
apart
from
the
others
a
vantage
point
as
it
were
he
looked
about
and
not
seeing
the
new
guest
inquired
has
any
one
seen
that
alleged
army
officer
who
arrived
here
this
morning
no
one
could
say
anything
more
than
that
they
had
left
him
two
or
three
miles
back
i
thought
so
he
said
tersely
there
you
have
a
fine
example
of
the
desk
general
and
major
we
had
in
the
army
men
who
sit
in
a
swivel
chair
all
day
wear
a
braided
uniform
and
issue
orders
to
other
people
you
think
a
man
like
that
who
had
been
trained
at
west
point
and
seen
service
in
the
philippines
would
have
sense
enough
to
keep
himself
in
condition
not
at
all
as
soon
as
they
get
a
little
way
up
in
their
profession
they
want
to
sit
around
hotel
grills
or
society
ballrooms
and
show
off
tell
how
wonderful
they
are
here
a
man
an
army
officer
in
such
rotten
shape
that
if
i
sent
a
good
horse
after
him
now
it
ten
to
one
he
could
get
on
him
i
have
to
send
a
truck
or
some
such
thing
he
subsided
about
an
hour
later
the
major
did
appear
much
the
worse
for
wear
a
groom
with
a
horse
had
been
sent
out
after
him
and
as
the
latter
confided
to
some
one
afterward
he
had
to
help
the
major
on
from
that
time
on
on
the
short
block
and
the
long
as
well
as
on
those
horseback
tours
which
every
second
or
third
morning
we
were
supposed
to
take
the
major
was
his
especial
target
he
loved
to
pick
on
him
to
tell
him
that
he
was
nearly
all
guts
a
phrase
which
literally
sickened
me
at
that
time
to
ask
him
how
he
expected
to
stay
in
the
army
if
he
could
do
this
or
that
what
good
was
he
to
the
army
how
could
any
soldier
respect
a
thing
like
him
and
so
on
until
while
at
first
i
pitied
the
major
later
on
i
admired
his
pluck
culhane
foisted
upon
him
his
sorriest
and
boniest
nag
the
meanest
animal
he
could
find
yet
he
never
complained
and
although
he
forced
on
him
all
the
foods
he
knew
the
major
could
not
like
still
there
was
no
complaint
he
insisted
that
he
should
be
out
and
around
of
an
afternoon
when
most
of
us
lay
about
allowed
him
no
drinks
whatever
although
he
was
accustomed
to
them
the
major
as
i
learned
afterwards
stayed
not
six
but
twelve
weeks
and
passed
the
tests
which
permitted
him
to
remain
in
the
army
but
to
return
to
culhane
himself
the
latter
method
always
contained
this
element
of
nag
and
pester
which
along
with
his
brazen
reliance
on
and
pride
in
his
brute
strength
at
sixty
made
all
these
others
look
so
puny
and
ineffectual
they
might
have
brains
and
skill
but
here
they
were
in
his
institution
more
or
less
undone
nervously
and
physically
and
here
he
was
cold
contemptuous
not
caring
much
whether
they
came
stayed
or
went
and
laughing
at
them
even
as
they
raged
now
and
then
it
was
rumored
that
he
found
some
single
individual
in
whom
he
would
take
an
interest
but
not
often
in
the
main
i
think
he
despised
them
one
and
all
for
the
puny
machines
they
were
he
even
despised
life
and
the
pleasures
and
dissipations
or
swinish
indolence
which
in
his
judgment
characterized
most
men
i
recall
once
for
instance
his
telling
us
how
as
a
private
in
the
united
states
army
when
the
division
of
which
he
was
a
unit
was
shut
up
in
winter
quarters
huddled
about
stoves
smoking
as
he
characterized
them
filthy
pipes
or
chewing
tobacco
and
spitting
actually
lousy
and
never
changing
their
clothes
for
weeks
on
end
how
he
revolting
at
all
this
and
the
disease
and
fevers
ensuing
had
kept
out
of
doors
as
much
as
possible
even
in
the
coldest
weather
and
finding
no
other
way
of
keeping
clean
the
single
shift
of
underwear
and
the
one
uniform
he
possessed
he
had
every
other
day
or
so
washed
all
uniform
and
underwear
with
or
without
soap
as
conditions
might
compel
in
a
nearby
stream
often
breaking
the
ice
to
get
to
the
water
and
dancing
about
naked
in
the
cold
running
and
jumping
while
they
dried
on
bushes
or
the
branch
of
a
tree
those
poor
rats
he
added
most
contemptuously
used
to
sit
inside
and
wonder
at
me
or
laugh
and
jeer
hovering
over
their
stoves
but
a
lot
of
them
died
that
very
winter
and
here
i
am
today
and
well
we
knew
it
i
used
to
study
the
faces
of
many
of
the
puffy
gelatinous
souls
so
long
confined
to
their
comfortable
offices
restaurants
and
homes
that
two
hours
on
horseback
all
but
wore
them
out
and
wonder
how
this
appealed
to
them
i
think
that
in
the
main
they
took
it
as
an
illustration
of
either
one
of
two
things
insanity
or
giant
and
therefore
strength
but
in
regard
to
them
culhane
was
by
no
means
so
tolerant
one
day
as
i
recall
there
arrived
at
the
sanitarium
a
stout
and
hebrew
with
a
pate
protruding
paunch
and
fat
arms
and
legs
who
applied
to
culhane
for
admission
and
as
much
to
irritate
his
other
guests
i
think
as
to
torture
this
particular
specimen
into
some
semblance
of
vitality
he
admitted
him
and
thereafter
from
the
hour
he
entered
until
he
left
about
the
time
i
did
culhane
seemed
to
follow
him
with
a
wolfish
and
savage
idea
he
gave
him
a
most
damnable
and
savage
horse
one
that
kicked
and
bit
and
at
mounting
time
would
place
itzky
i
think
his
name
was
up
near
the
front
of
the
procession
where
he
could
watch
him
always
at
when
we
were
permitted
to
ride
there
was
inside
the
great
stable
a
kind
of
preliminary
military
inspection
of
all
our
accouterments
seeing
that
we
had
to
saddle
and
bridle
and
bring
forth
our
own
steeds
this
particular
person
could
not
saddle
a
horse
very
well
nor
put
on
his
bit
and
bridle
the
animal
was
inclined
to
rear
and
plunge
when
he
came
near
to
fix
him
with
an
evil
eye
and
bite
at
him
and
above
all
things
culhane
seemed
to
value
strain
of
this
kind
if
he
could
just
make
his
guests
feel
the
pressure
of
necessity
in
connection
with
their
work
he
was
happy
to
this
end
he
would
employ
the
most
contemptuous
and
grilling
comment
thus
to
itzky
he
was
most
unkind
he
would
look
over
all
most
cynically
examining
the
saddles
and
bridles
and
then
say
oh
i
see
you
have
learned
how
to
tighten
a
yet
or
i
do
believe
you
have
your
saddle
to
you
would
if
you
could
that
one
thing
sure
how
do
you
expect
a
horse
to
be
sensible
or
quiet
when
he
knows
that
he
is
saddled
right
any
horse
knows
that
much
and
whether
he
has
an
ass
for
a
rider
i
kick
and
bite
too
if
i
were
some
of
these
horses
having
a
lot
of
damned
fools
and
wasters
to
pack
all
over
the
country
loosen
that
belt
and
fasten
it
right
there
might
be
nothing
wrong
with
it
and
move
your
saddle
up
do
you
want
to
sit
over
the
horse
rump
then
would
come
the
fateful
moment
of
mounting
there
was
of
course
the
accepted
and
perfect
way
his
way
left
foot
in
stirrup
an
easy
balanced
spring
and
light
descent
into
the
seat
one
should
be
able
to
slip
the
right
foot
into
the
right
stirrup
with
the
same
motion
of
mounting
but
imagine
fifty
sixty
seventy
men
all
sizes
weights
and
differing
conditions
of
health
and
mood
a
number
of
these
people
had
never
ridden
a
horse
before
coming
here
and
were
as
nervous
and
frightened
as
children
such
mounts
such
fumbling
around
once
they
were
in
their
saddles
for
the
right
stirrup
and
all
the
while
culhane
would
be
sitting
out
front
like
an
army
captain
on
the
only
decent
steed
in
the
place
eyeing
us
with
a
look
of
infinite
and
weary
contempt
that
served
to
increase
our
troubles
a
thousandfold
well
you
all
on
are
you
you
all
do
it
so
gracefully
i
like
to
sit
here
and
admire
you
hulbert
there
throws
his
leg
over
his
horse
back
so
artistically
that
he
almost
kicks
his
teeth
out
and
effingham
does
his
best
to
fall
off
on
the
other
side
and
where
itzky
i
do
even
see
him
oh
yes
there
he
is
well
this
to
itzky
frantically
endeavoring
to
get
one
fat
foot
in
a
stirrup
and
pull
himself
up
what
about
you
ca
you
get
your
leg
that
high
here
a
man
who
for
years
has
been
running
a
business
and
employing
five
hundred
people
but
he
ca
get
on
a
horse
imagine
five
hundred
people
dependent
on
that
for
their
living
at
this
point
say
itzky
succeeds
in
mounting
well
he
actually
on
now
see
if
you
can
stick
while
we
ride
a
block
or
two
you
find
the
right
stirrup
itzky
just
a
little
forward
of
your
horse
belly
on
the
right
side
see
a
fine
bunch
this
is
to
lead
out
through
a
country
hell
no
wonder
i
got
a
bad
reputation
throughout
this
section
well
forward
and
see
if
you
can
keep
from
falling
off
then
we
were
out
through
the
and
the
privet
gate
at
a
smart
trot
only
to
burst
into
a
headlong
gallop
a
little
farther
on
down
the
road
to
the
seasoned
riders
it
was
all
well
enough
but
to
beginners
those
nervous
about
horses
fearful
about
themselves
the
first
day
not
having
ridden
in
years
and
being
uncertain
as
to
my
skill
i
could
scarcely
stay
on
several
days
later
i
by
then
having
become
a
reasonably
seasoned
rider
it
was
itzky
who
appeared
on
the
scene
and
after
him
various
others
on
this
particular
trip
i
am
thinking
of
itzky
fell
or
rolled
off
and
could
not
again
mount
he
was
miles
from
the
repair
shop
and
culhane
discovering
his
plight
was
by
no
means
sympathetic
we
had
a
short
ride
back
to
where
he
sat
lamely
by
the
roadside
viewing
disconsolately
the
cavalcade
and
the
country
in
general
well
what
the
matter
with
you
now
it
was
culhane
eyeing
him
most
severely
i
hef
hurt
my
foot
i
kent
stay
on
you
mean
you
rather
walk
do
you
and
lead
your
horse
vell
i
kent
ride
all
right
then
you
lead
your
horse
back
to
the
stable
if
you
want
any
lunch
and
hereafter
you
run
with
the
on
the
short
block
until
you
think
you
can
ride
without
falling
off
what
the
good
of
my
keeping
a
stable
of
horses
at
the
service
of
a
lot
of
who
do
even
know
how
to
use
all
they
do
is
ruin
in
a
week
or
two
after
a
good
horse
is
put
in
the
stable
he
not
fit
for
a
gentleman
to
ride
they
pull
and
haul
and
kick
and
beat
when
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
horse
has
a
damned
sight
more
sense
than
they
have
we
rode
off
leaving
itzky
alone
the
men
on
either
side
of
me
we
were
riding
three
abreast
scoffed
under
their
breath
at
the
statement
that
we
were
furnished
decent
horses
the
nerve
this
nag
this
bag
of
bones
to
think
a
thing
like
this
should
be
called
a
horse
but
there
were
no
outward
murmurs
and
no
particular
sympathy
for
itzky
he
was
a
fat
stuff
a
manufacturer
they
would
bet
let
him
walk
and
sweat
so
much
for
sympathy
in
this
gay
realm
where
all
were
seeking
to
restore
their
own
little
bodies
whatever
happened
so
many
of
these
men
varied
so
greatly
in
their
looks
capacities
and
troubles
that
they
were
always
amusing
thus
i
recall
one
lean
iron
manufacturer
the
millionaire
president
of
a
great
frog
and
switch
company
who
had
come
on
from
kansas
city
troubled
with
anæmia
neurasthenia
nervous
derangement
of
the
heart
and
various
other
things
he
was
over
fifty
very
much
concerned
about
himself
his
family
his
business
his
friends
anxious
to
obtain
the
benefits
of
this
celebrated
course
of
which
he
had
heard
so
much
walking
or
running
near
me
on
his
first
day
he
took
occasion
to
make
inquiries
in
regard
to
culhane
the
life
here
and
later
on
confidences
as
to
his
own
condition
it
appeared
that
his
chief
trouble
was
his
heart
a
kind
of
phantom
disturbance
which
made
him
fear
that
he
was
about
to
drop
dead
and
which
came
and
went
leaving
him
uncertain
as
to
whether
he
had
it
or
not
on
entering
he
had
confided
to
culhane
the
mysteries
of
his
case
and
the
latter
had
examined
him
pronouncing
him
rather
roughly
as
he
explained
to
me
quite
fit
to
do
all
the
silly
work
he
would
have
to
do
here
nevertheless
while
we
were
out
on
the
short
block
his
heart
was
hurting
him
at
the
same
time
it
had
been
made
rather
clear
to
him
that
if
he
wished
to
stay
here
he
would
have
to
fulfill
all
the
obligations
imposed
after
a
mile
or
two
or
three
of
quick
walking
and
jogging
he
was
saying
to
me
you
know
i
not
really
sure
that
i
can
do
this
it
very
severe
more
so
than
i
thought
my
heart
is
not
doing
very
well
it
feels
very
fluttery
but
i
said
if
he
told
you
you
could
stand
it
you
can
i
sure
it
not
very
likely
he
say
you
could
if
you
could
he
examined
you
did
he
i
do
believe
he
deliberately
put
a
strain
on
any
one
who
could
stand
it
yes
he
admitted
doubtfully
that
true
perhaps
still
he
continued
to
complain
and
complain
and
to
grow
more
and
more
worried
until
finally
he
slowed
up
and
was
lost
in
the
background
reaching
the
gymnasium
at
the
proper
time
i
bathed
and
dressed
myself
quickly
and
waited
on
the
balcony
over
the
bathroom
to
see
what
would
happen
in
this
case
as
a
rule
culhane
stood
in
or
near
the
door
at
this
time
having
just
returned
from
some
route
or
block
himself
to
see
how
the
others
were
faring
and
he
was
there
when
the
iron
manufacturer
came
limping
up
fifteen
minutes
late
one
hand
over
his
heart
the
other
to
his
mouth
and
exclaiming
as
he
drew
near
i
do
believe
culhane
that
i
ca
stand
this
i
afraid
there
is
something
the
matter
with
my
heart
it
fluttering
so
to
hell
with
your
heart
did
i
tell
you
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
it
get
into
the
bath
the
troubled
manufacturer
overawed
or
reassured
as
the
case
might
be
entered
the
bath
and
ten
minutes
later
might
have
been
seen
entering
the
as
comfortable
apparently
as
any
one
afterwards
he
confessed
to
me
on
one
of
our
jogs
that
there
was
something
about
culhane
which
him
and
made
him
believe
that
there
was
anything
wrong
with
his
heart
which
there
was
i
presume
the
intensely
interesting
thing
about
culhane
was
this
different
very
original
and
forthright
if
at
times
brutal
point
of
view
it
was
a
blazing
material
world
of
which
he
was
the
center
the
sun
and
yet
always
i
had
the
sense
of
very
great
life
with
no
knowledge
of
or
interest
in
the
superior
mental
sciences
or
arts
or
philosophies
still
he
seemed
to
suggest
and
even
live
them
he
was
in
his
way
an
exemplification
of
that
ancient
greek
regimen
and
stark
thought
which
brought
back
the
ten
thousand
from
cunaxa
he
seemed
even
to
suggest
in
his
rough
way
historical
perspective
and
balance
he
knew
men
and
apparently
he
sensed
how
at
best
and
at
bottom
life
was
to
be
lived
with
not
too
much
emotional
or
appetitive
swaying
in
any
one
direction
and
not
too
little
either
yet
in
trapseing
about
this
particular
realm
each
day
with
ministers
lawyers
doctors
actors
manufacturers
papa
or
mamma
young
hopefuls
and
petted
heirs
young
scapegraces
and
society
men
of
the
extreme
upper
crust
stuffed
and
plethoric
with
money
and
as
innocent
of
sound
knowledge
or
necessary
energy
in
some
instances
as
any
one
might
well
be
one
could
not
help
speculating
as
to
how
it
was
that
such
a
man
as
indifferent
and
all
but
discourteous
as
this
one
could
attract
them
and
so
many
to
him
they
came
from
all
parts
of
america
the
pacific
the
gulf
the
atlantic
and
canada
and
yet
although
they
did
not
relish
him
or
his
treatment
of
them
once
here
they
stayed
walking
or
running
or
idling
about
with
them
one
could
always
hear
from
one
or
another
that
culhane
was
too
harsh
a
bounder
an
upstart
a
cheap
pugilist
or
wrestler
at
best
i
myself
thought
so
at
times
when
i
was
angry
yet
here
they
were
and
here
i
was
and
staying
he
was
low
vulgar
yet
here
we
were
and
yet
meditating
on
him
i
began
to
think
that
he
was
really
one
of
the
most
remarkable
men
i
had
ever
known
for
these
people
he
dealt
with
were
of
all
the
most
difficult
to
deal
with
in
the
main
they
were
of
that
order
or
condition
of
mind
which
springs
from
too
much
wealth
too
easily
acquired
or
inherited
or
from
a
blazing
material
success
the
cause
of
which
was
their
own
savage
viewpoint
hence
a
colder
and
in
some
respects
a
more
critical
group
of
men
i
have
never
known
most
of
them
had
already
seen
so
much
of
life
in
a
libertine
way
that
there
was
little
left
to
enjoy
they
sniffed
at
almost
everything
culhane
included
and
yet
they
were
obviously
drawn
to
him
i
tried
to
explain
this
to
myself
on
the
ground
that
there
is
some
iron
power
in
some
people
which
literally
compels
this
whether
one
will
or
no
or
that
they
were
in
the
main
so
tired
of
life
and
so
truly
selfish
and
egotistic
that
it
required
some
such
different
iron
or
caviar
mood
plus
such
a
threatening
regimen
to
make
them
really
take
an
interest
sick
as
they
were
he
was
about
the
only
thing
left
on
which
they
could
sharpen
their
teeth
with
any
result
as
i
have
said
a
part
of
culhane
general
scheme
was
to
arrange
the
starting
time
for
the
walks
and
jogs
about
the
long
and
short
blocks
so
that
if
one
moved
along
briskly
he
reached
the
sanitarium
at
and
had
a
few
minutes
in
which
to
bathe
and
cool
off
and
change
his
clothes
before
entering
the
where
if
not
at
the
bathroom
door
beforehand
culhane
would
be
waiting
seated
at
his
little
table
ready
to
keep
watch
on
the
time
and
condition
of
all
those
due
thus
one
day
a
group
of
us
having
done
the
long
block
in
less
time
than
we
should
have
devoted
to
it
came
in
panting
and
rejoicing
that
we
had
cut
the
record
by
seven
minutes
we
did
not
know
that
he
was
around
but
in
the
as
we
entered
he
scoffed
at
our
achievement
you
think
you
smart
do
you
he
said
sourly
and
without
any
preliminary
statement
as
to
how
he
knew
we
had
done
it
in
less
time
you
come
out
here
and
pay
me
one
hundred
a
week
and
then
you
want
to
be
cute
and
play
tricks
with
your
own
money
and
health
i
want
you
to
remember
just
one
thing
my
reputation
is
just
as
much
involved
with
the
results
here
as
your
money
i
do
need
anybody
money
and
i
do
need
my
orders
obeyed
now
you
all
have
watches
you
just
time
yourselves
and
do
that
block
in
the
time
required
if
you
ca
do
it
that
one
thing
i
can
forgive
a
man
too
weak
or
sick
to
do
it
but
i
have
any
use
for
a
mere
smart
aleck
and
i
do
want
any
more
of
it
see
that
luncheon
was
very
sad
another
thing
in
connection
with
these
luncheons
and
dinners
which
were
sharply
timed
to
the
minute
were
these
crisp
table
speeches
often
made
some
particular
offender
or
his
offense
at
other
times
mere
sarcastic
comments
on
life
in
general
and
the
innate
cussedness
of
human
nature
which
amused
at
the
same
time
that
they
were
certain
to
irritate
some
for
who
is
it
that
is
not
interested
in
hearing
the
peccadilloes
of
his
neighbor
aired
thus
while
i
was
there
there
was
a
new
york
society
man
by
the
name
of
blake
who
unfortunately
was
given
to
severe
periods
of
alcoholism
the
results
of
which
were
after
a
time
nervous
disorders
which
sent
him
here
in
many
ways
he
was
as
amiable
and
courteous
and
considerate
a
soul
as
one
could
meet
anywhere
he
had
that
smooth
gracious
something
about
him
good
nature
for
one
thing
a
kind
of
understanding
and
sympathy
for
various
forms
of
life
which
left
him
highly
noncensorious
if
genially
examining
at
times
but
his
love
of
drink
or
rather
his
mild
attempts
here
to
arrange
some
method
by
which
in
this
droughty
world
he
could
obtain
a
little
aroused
in
culhane
not
so
much
opposition
as
an
amused
contempt
for
at
bottom
i
think
he
really
liked
the
man
blake
was
so
orderly
so
sincere
in
his
attempts
to
fulfill
conditions
only
about
once
every
week
or
so
he
would
suggest
that
he
be
allowed
to
go
to
white
plains
or
rye
or
even
new
york
on
some
errand
or
other
most
of
which
requests
were
promptly
and
nearly
always
publicly
refused
for
although
culhane
had
his
private
suite
at
one
end
of
the
great
building
where
one
might
suppose
one
might
go
to
make
a
private
plea
still
one
could
never
find
him
there
he
refused
to
receive
complaints
or
requests
or
visits
of
any
kind
there
if
you
wanted
to
speak
to
him
you
had
to
do
it
when
he
was
with
the
group
in
its
entirety
a
commonsense
enough
policy
but
just
the
same
there
were
those
who
had
reasonable
requests
or
complaints
and
these
by
a
fine
intuition
as
to
who
was
who
in
this
institution
and
what
might
be
expected
of
each
one
he
managed
to
hear
very
softly
withdrawing
slowly
as
they
talked
or
inviting
them
into
the
office
in
the
main
however
the
requests
were
very
much
like
those
of
blake
men
who
wanted
to
get
off
somewhere
for
a
day
or
two
feeling
as
they
did
after
a
week
or
two
or
three
especially
fit
and
beginning
to
think
no
doubt
of
the
various
comforts
and
pleasures
which
the
city
offered
but
to
all
these
he
was
more
or
less
adamant
by
hook
or
by
crook
by
special
arrangements
with
friends
or
agents
in
nearby
towns
and
the
principal
showy
resorts
of
new
york
he
managed
to
know
providing
they
did
leave
the
grounds
either
with
or
without
his
consent
about
where
they
were
and
what
they
had
done
and
in
case
any
of
his
rules
or
their
agreements
were
broken
their
privileges
were
thereafter
cut
off
or
they
were
promptly
ejected
their
trunks
being
set
out
on
the
roadway
in
front
of
the
estate
and
they
being
left
to
make
their
way
to
shelter
elsewhere
as
best
they
might
on
one
occasion
however
blake
had
been
allowed
to
go
to
new
york
over
saturday
and
sunday
to
attend
to
some
urgent
business
as
he
said
he
on
his
honor
having
promised
to
avoid
the
white
lights
nevertheless
he
did
not
manage
so
to
do
but
instead
in
some
comfortable
section
of
that
region
was
seen
drinking
enough
to
last
him
until
perhaps
he
should
have
another
opportunity
to
return
to
the
city
on
his
return
to
the
shop
on
monday
morning
or
late
sunday
night
culhane
pretended
not
to
see
him
until
noonday
lunch
when
his
jog
over
the
long
block
done
with
and
his
bath
taken
he
came
dapperly
into
the
wishing
to
look
as
innocent
and
fit
as
possible
but
culhane
was
there
before
him
at
his
little
table
in
the
center
of
the
room
and
patting
the
head
of
one
of
the
two
collies
that
always
followed
him
about
on
the
grounds
or
in
the
house
began
as
follows
a
dog
he
said
very
distinctly
and
in
his
most
cynical
tone
and
apparently
apropos
of
nothing
which
usually
augured
that
the
lightning
of
his
criticism
was
about
to
strike
somewhere
is
so
much
better
than
the
average
man
that
it
an
insult
to
the
dog
to
compare
them
the
dog
really
decent
he
has
no
sloppy
vices
you
set
a
plate
of
food
before
a
blooded
dog
and
he
wo
think
of
gorging
himself
sick
or
silly
he
eats
what
he
needs
and
then
stops
so
does
a
cat
which
is
of
course
by
no
means
true
but
still
a
dog
get
a
red
nose
from
drinking
too
much
by
now
all
eyes
were
turning
in
the
direction
of
blake
whose
nose
was
faintly
tinged
he
does
get
gonorrhea
or
syphilis
the
united
glances
veered
in
the
direction
of
three
or
four
young
scapegraces
of
wealth
all
of
whom
were
suspected
of
these
diseases
he
does
hang
around
hotel
bars
and
swill
and
get
his
tongue
thick
and
talk
about
how
rich
he
is
or
how
old
his
family
is
this
augured
that
blake
did
such
things
which
i
doubt
but
once
more
all
eyes
were
shifted
to
him
he
does
break
his
word
within
the
limits
of
his
poor
little
brain
he
faithful
he
does
what
he
thinks
he
called
upon
to
do
but
you
take
a
man
more
especially
a
gentleman
one
of
these
fellows
who
is
always
very
pointed
in
emphasizing
that
he
is
a
gentleman
which
blake
never
did
let
him
inherit
eight
or
ten
millions
give
him
a
college
education
let
him
be
socially
well
connected
and
what
does
he
do
not
a
damned
thing
if
he
can
help
it
except
contract
vices
run
from
one
saloon
to
another
one
gambling
house
to
another
one
girl
to
another
one
meal
to
another
he
does
need
to
know
anything
necessarily
he
may
be
the
lowest
dog
physically
and
in
every
other
way
and
still
he
a
gentleman
because
he
has
money
wears
spats
and
a
high
hat
why
i
seen
fifty
poor
boob
prize
fighters
in
my
time
who
could
put
it
all
over
most
of
the
gentlemen
i
have
ever
seen
they
kept
their
word
they
tried
to
be
physically
fit
they
tried
to
stand
up
in
the
world
and
earn
their
own
living
and
be
somebody
he
was
probably
thinking
of
himself
but
a
gentleman
wants
to
boast
of
his
past
and
his
family
to
tell
you
that
he
must
go
to
the
city
on
business
his
lawyers
or
some
directors
want
to
see
him
then
he
swills
around
at
hotel
bars
stays
with
some
of
his
lady
whores
and
then
comes
back
here
and
expects
me
to
pull
him
into
shape
again
to
make
his
nose
a
little
less
red
he
thinks
he
can
use
my
place
to
fall
back
on
when
he
ca
go
any
longer
to
fix
him
up
to
do
some
more
swilling
later
on
well
i
want
to
serve
notice
on
all
gentlemen
here
and
in
particular
and
he
heavily
and
sardonically
emphasized
the
words
that
it
wo
do
this
is
a
hospital
attached
to
a
whorehouse
or
a
saloon
and
as
for
the
trashy
little
six
hundred
paid
here
i
do
need
it
i
turned
away
more
men
who
have
been
here
once
or
twice
and
have
shown
me
that
they
were
just
using
this
place
and
me
as
something
to
help
them
go
on
with
their
lousy
drinking
and
carousing
than
would
fill
this
building
sensible
men
know
it
they
do
try
to
use
me
it
only
the
wastrels
or
their
mothers
or
fathers
who
bring
their
boys
and
husbands
and
cry
who
try
to
use
me
and
i
take
once
or
twice
but
not
oftener
when
a
man
goes
out
of
here
cured
i
know
he
is
cured
i
never
want
to
see
him
again
i
want
him
to
go
out
in
the
world
and
stand
up
i
do
want
him
to
come
back
here
in
six
months
sniveling
to
be
put
in
shape
again
he
disgusts
me
he
makes
me
sick
i
feel
like
ordering
him
off
the
place
and
i
do
and
that
the
end
of
him
let
him
go
and
bamboozle
somebody
else
i
shown
him
all
i
know
there
no
mystery
he
can
do
as
much
for
himself
once
he
been
here
as
i
can
if
he
wo
well
and
good
and
i
saying
one
thing
more
there
one
man
here
to
whom
this
particularly
applies
today
this
is
his
last
call
he
been
here
twice
when
he
goes
out
this
time
he
come
back
now
see
if
some
of
you
can
remember
some
of
the
things
been
telling
you
he
subsided
and
opened
his
little
pint
of
wine
another
day
while
i
was
there
he
began
as
follows
if
there
one
class
of
men
that
needs
to
be
improved
in
this
country
it
lawyers
i
do
know
why
it
is
but
there
something
in
the
very
nature
of
the
work
of
a
lawyer
which
appears
to
make
him
cynical
and
to
want
to
wear
a
look
most
lawyers
are
little
more
than
sharper
crooks
than
the
crooks
they
have
to
deal
with
they
always
trying
to
get
in
on
some
case
or
other
where
they
have
to
outwit
the
law
save
some
one
from
getting
what
he
justly
deserves
and
then
they
are
supposed
to
be
honest
and
think
of
it
to
judge
by
some
of
the
specimens
i
get
up
here
and
then
some
lawyer
in
the
place
would
turn
a
shrewd
inquiring
glance
in
his
direction
or
steadfastly
gaze
at
his
plate
or
out
the
window
while
the
others
stared
at
him
you
would
think
they
were
the
salt
of
the
earth
or
that
they
were
following
a
really
noble
profession
or
that
they
were
above
or
better
than
other
men
in
their
abilities
well
if
being
conniving
and
tricky
are
fine
traits
i
suppose
they
are
but
personally
i
ca
see
it
generally
speaking
they
physically
the
poorest
fish
i
get
here
they
slow
and
meditative
and
sallow
mostly
because
they
get
too
little
exercise
i
presume
and
they
never
direct
and
enthusiastic
in
an
argument
a
lawyer
always
wants
to
stick
in
an
or
a
to
get
around
you
in
some
way
he
never
willing
to
answer
you
quickly
or
directly
watched
now
for
nearly
fifteen
years
and
they
all
more
or
less
alike
they
think
they
very
individual
and
different
but
not
most
of
them
do
know
nearly
as
much
about
life
as
a
good
business
or
society
man
this
in
the
absence
of
any
desire
to
discuss
these
two
breeds
for
the
time
being
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
never
see
why
a
really
attractive
woman
would
ever
want
to
marry
a
lawyer
and
so
he
would
talk
on
revealing
one
little
unsatisfactory
trait
after
another
in
connection
with
the
tribe
their
raw
places
as
it
were
until
you
would
about
conclude
supposing
you
had
never
heard
him
talk
concerning
any
other
profession
that
lawyers
were
the
most
ignoble
the
pettiest
the
most
inefficient
physically
and
mentally
of
all
the
men
he
had
ever
encountered
and
in
his
noble
savage
state
there
would
not
be
one
to
disagree
with
him
for
he
had
such
an
animal
mien
that
you
had
the
feeling
that
instead
of
an
argument
you
would
get
a
physical
rip
which
would
leave
you
bleeding
for
days
the
next
day
or
a
day
or
two
or
four
or
six
later
according
to
his
mood
it
would
be
doctors
or
merchants
or
society
men
or
politicians
he
would
discourse
about
and
kind
heaven
what
a
drubbing
they
would
get
he
seemed
always
to
be
meditating
on
the
vulnerable
points
of
his
victims
anxious
and
yet
presumably
not
to
show
them
what
poor
fallible
shabby
petty
and
all
but
drooling
creatures
they
were
thus
in
regard
to
merchants
the
average
man
who
has
a
little
business
of
some
kind
a
factory
or
a
wholesale
or
brokerage
house
or
a
hotel
or
a
restaurant
usually
has
a
distinctly
mind
at
this
all
the
merchants
and
manufacturers
were
likely
to
give
a
very
sharp
ear
as
a
rule
find
that
they
know
just
the
one
little
line
with
which
connected
and
nothing
more
one
man
knows
all
about
cloaks
and
suits
this
may
have
been
a
slap
at
poor
itzky
or
he
knows
a
little
something
about
leather
goods
or
shoes
or
lamps
or
furniture
and
all
he
knows
if
he
an
american
he
buckle
down
to
that
little
business
and
work
night
and
day
sweat
blood
and
make
every
one
else
connected
with
him
sweat
it
underpay
his
employees
swindle
his
friends
himself
and
his
family
in
order
to
get
a
few
thousand
dollars
and
seem
as
good
as
some
one
else
who
has
a
few
thousand
and
yet
he
does
want
to
be
different
from
he
wants
to
be
just
like
the
other
fellow
if
some
one
in
his
line
has
a
house
up
on
the
hudson
or
on
riverside
drive
when
he
gets
his
money
he
wants
to
go
there
and
live
if
the
fellow
in
his
line
or
some
other
that
he
knows
something
about
belongs
to
a
certain
club
he
has
to
belong
to
it
even
if
the
club
does
want
him
or
he
would
look
well
in
it
he
wants
to
have
the
same
tailor
the
same
grocer
smoke
the
same
brand
of
cigars
and
go
to
the
same
summer
resort
as
the
other
fellow
they
even
want
to
look
alike
god
and
then
when
they
just
like
every
one
else
they
think
they
somebody
they
have
a
single
idea
outside
their
line
and
yet
because
they
made
money
they
want
to
tell
other
people
how
to
live
and
think
imagine
a
rich
butcher
or
or
any
one
else
presuming
to
tell
me
how
to
think
or
live
he
stared
about
him
as
though
he
saw
many
exemplifications
of
his
picture
present
and
it
was
always
interesting
to
see
how
those
whom
his
description
really
did
fit
look
as
though
he
could
not
possibly
be
referring
to
them
of
all
types
or
professions
that
came
here
i
think
he
disliked
doctors
most
the
reason
was
of
course
that
the
work
they
did
or
were
about
to
do
in
the
world
bordered
on
that
which
he
was
trying
to
accomplish
and
the
chances
were
that
they
sniffed
at
or
at
least
critically
examined
what
he
was
doing
with
an
eye
to
finding
its
weak
spots
in
many
cases
no
doubt
he
fancied
that
they
were
there
to
study
and
copy
his
methods
and
ideas
without
having
the
decency
later
on
to
attribute
their
knowledge
to
him
it
was
short
shrift
for
any
one
of
them
with
ideas
or
notions
unfriendly
to
him
advanced
in
his
presence
for
a
little
while
during
my
stay
there
was
a
rather
solid
physically
and
decidedly
mentally
doctor
who
ate
at
the
same
small
table
as
i
and
who
was
never
tired
of
airing
his
views
medical
and
otherwise
he
confided
to
me
rather
loftily
that
there
was
to
be
sure
something
to
culhane
views
and
methods
but
that
they
were
here
still
one
could
the
value
of
drugs
too
as
for
himself
he
had
decided
to
achieve
a
happy
medium
if
possible
and
for
this
reason
for
one
he
had
come
here
to
study
culhane
as
for
culhane
in
spite
of
the
young
doctor
condescension
and
understanding
or
perhaps
better
yet
because
of
it
he
thoroughly
disliked
barely
tolerated
him
and
was
never
tired
of
commenting
on
little
dancing
medics
with
their
pill
cases
and
easily
acquired
book
knowledge
boasting
of
their
supposed
learning
which
somebody
else
had
paid
for
as
he
once
said
their
fathers
of
course
and
when
they
were
sick
some
of
them
at
least
they
had
to
come
out
here
to
him
or
they
came
to
steal
his
theory
and
start
a
shabby
grafting
sanitarium
of
their
own
he
knew
them
one
noon
we
were
at
lunch
occasionally
before
seating
himself
at
his
small
central
table
he
would
walk
or
glance
about
and
having
good
eyes
would
spy
some
little
defect
or
delinquency
somewhere
and
of
course
immediately
act
upon
it
one
of
the
rules
of
the
repair
shop
was
that
you
were
to
eat
what
was
put
before
you
especially
when
it
differed
from
what
your
table
companion
received
thus
a
fat
man
at
a
table
with
a
lean
one
might
receive
a
small
portion
of
lean
meat
no
potatoes
and
no
bread
or
one
little
roll
whereas
his
lean
acquaintance
opposite
would
be
receiving
a
large
portion
of
fat
meat
a
baked
or
boiled
potato
plenty
of
bread
and
butter
and
possibly
a
side
dish
of
some
kind
now
it
might
well
be
as
indeed
was
often
the
case
that
each
would
be
dissatisfied
with
his
apportionment
and
would
attempt
to
change
plates
but
this
was
the
one
thing
that
culhane
would
not
endure
so
upon
one
occasion
passing
near
the
table
at
which
sat
myself
and
the
doctor
for
the
time
being
he
noticed
that
he
was
not
eating
his
carrots
a
dish
which
had
been
especially
prepared
for
him
i
imagine
for
if
one
unconsciously
ignored
certain
things
the
first
day
or
two
of
his
stay
those
very
things
would
be
all
but
rammed
down
his
throat
during
the
remainder
of
his
stay
a
thing
concerning
which
one
guest
and
another
occasionally
cautioned
newcomers
however
this
may
have
been
in
this
particular
case
he
noticed
the
uneaten
carrots
and
pausing
a
moment
observed
what
the
matter
are
you
eating
your
carrots
we
had
almost
finished
eating
who
me
replied
the
medic
looking
up
oh
no
i
never
eat
carrots
you
know
i
do
like
them
oh
do
you
said
culhane
sweetly
you
do
like
them
and
so
you
do
eat
them
well
suppose
you
eat
them
here
they
may
do
you
a
little
good
just
as
a
change
but
i
never
eat
carrots
retorted
the
medic
tersely
and
with
a
slight
show
of
resentment
or
opposition
scenting
perhaps
a
new
order
no
not
outside
perhaps
but
here
you
do
you
eat
carrots
here
see
yes
but
why
should
i
eat
them
if
i
do
like
them
they
do
agree
with
me
must
i
eat
something
that
does
agree
with
me
just
because
it
a
rule
or
to
please
you
to
please
me
or
the
carrots
or
any
damned
thing
you
please
but
eat
the
doctor
subsided
for
a
day
or
two
he
went
about
commenting
on
what
a
farce
the
whole
thing
was
how
ridiculous
to
make
any
one
eat
what
was
not
suited
to
him
but
just
the
same
while
he
was
there
he
ate
them
as
for
myself
i
was
very
fond
of
large
boiled
potatoes
and
substantial
orders
of
fat
and
lean
meat
and
in
consequence
having
been
so
foolish
as
to
show
this
preference
i
received
but
the
weakest
most
contemptible
and
puling
little
spuds
and
pale
orders
of
meat
with
it
is
true
plenty
of
other
side
dishes
whereas
a
later
of
mine
a
distressed
and
neurasthenic
society
man
was
receiving
i
soon
learned
he
especially
abhorred
them
potatoes
as
big
as
my
two
fists
now
look
at
that
now
look
at
that
he
often
said
peevishly
and
with
a
kind
of
sickly
whine
in
his
voice
when
he
saw
one
being
put
before
him
he
knows
i
do
like
potatoes
and
see
what
i
get
and
look
at
the
little
bit
of
a
thing
he
gives
you
it
a
shame
the
way
he
nags
people
especially
over
this
food
question
i
do
think
there
a
thing
to
it
i
do
think
eating
a
big
potato
does
me
a
bit
of
good
or
you
the
little
one
and
yet
i
have
to
eat
the
things
or
get
out
and
i
need
to
get
on
my
feet
just
now
well
cheer
up
i
said
sympathetically
and
with
an
eye
on
the
large
potato
perhaps
he
is
always
looking
and
we
can
fix
it
you
mash
up
your
big
potato
and
put
butter
and
salt
on
it
and
i
do
the
same
with
my
little
one
then
when
he
not
looking
we
shift
oh
that
all
right
he
commented
but
we
better
look
out
if
he
sees
us
he
be
as
sore
as
the
devil
this
system
worked
well
enough
for
a
time
and
for
days
i
was
getting
all
the
potato
i
wanted
and
congratulating
myself
on
my
skill
when
one
day
as
i
was
slyly
forking
potatoes
out
of
his
dish
moved
helpfully
in
my
direction
i
saw
culhane
approaching
and
feared
that
our
trick
had
been
discovered
it
had
perhaps
some
snaky
waitress
has
told
on
us
or
he
had
seen
us
even
from
his
table
now
i
know
what
going
on
here
at
this
table
he
growled
savagely
and
i
want
you
two
to
cut
it
out
this
big
boob
here
he
was
referring
to
my
esteemed
self
who
has
strength
of
will
or
character
enough
to
keep
himself
in
good
health
and
has
to
be
brought
up
here
by
his
brother
has
brains
enough
to
see
that
when
i
plan
a
thing
for
his
benefit
it
is
for
his
benefit
and
not
mine
like
most
of
the
other
damned
fools
that
come
up
here
and
waste
their
money
and
my
time
he
thinks
i
playing
some
cute
game
with
him
tag
or
something
that
will
let
him
show
how
much
cuter
he
is
than
i
am
and
he
supposed
to
be
a
writer
and
have
a
little
his
brother
claims
it
anyhow
and
as
for
this
other
simp
here
and
now
he
was
addressing
the
assembled
diners
while
nodding
toward
my
friend
it
has
been
three
weeks
since
he
was
begging
to
know
what
i
could
do
for
him
and
now
look
at
him
entering
into
a
petty
little
game
of
i
swear
he
went
on
savagely
talking
to
the
room
in
general
sometimes
i
do
know
what
to
do
with
such
damned
fools
the
right
thing
would
be
to
set
these
two
and
about
fifty
others
in
this
place
out
on
the
main
road
with
their
trunks
and
let
them
go
to
hell
they
do
deserve
the
attention
of
a
conscientious
man
i
prohibit
gambling
what
happens
a
lot
of
nincompoops
and
mental
lightweights
with
more
money
than
brains
sneak
off
into
a
field
of
an
afternoon
on
the
excuse
that
they
are
going
for
a
walk
and
then
sit
down
and
lose
or
win
a
bucket
of
money
just
to
show
off
what
hells
of
fellows
they
are
what
sports
what
big
ams
i
prohibit
not
because
i
think
it
literally
going
to
kill
anybody
but
because
i
think
it
looks
bad
here
sets
a
bad
example
to
a
lot
of
young
wasters
who
come
here
and
who
ought
to
be
broken
of
the
vice
and
besides
because
i
do
like
here
do
want
it
and
wo
have
it
what
happens
a
lot
of
sissies
and
mamma
boys
and
pet
heirs
whose
fathers
have
got
enough
brains
to
cut
off
and
make
get
out
and
work
come
up
here
sneak
in
cigarettes
or
get
the
servants
to
and
then
hide
out
behind
the
barn
or
a
tree
down
in
the
lot
and
sneak
and
smoke
like
a
lot
of
cheap
schoolboys
god
it
makes
me
sick
what
the
use
of
a
man
working
out
a
fact
during
a
lifetime
and
letting
other
people
have
the
benefit
of
it
not
because
he
needs
their
money
but
that
they
need
his
help
if
all
the
time
he
is
going
to
have
such
cattle
to
deal
with
not
one
out
of
twenty
or
forty
men
that
come
here
really
wants
me
to
help
him
or
to
help
himself
what
he
wants
is
to
have
some
one
drive
him
in
the
way
he
ought
to
go
kick
him
into
it
instead
of
his
buckling
down
and
helping
himself
what
the
good
of
bothering
with
such
damned
fools
a
man
ought
to
take
the
whole
pack
and
run
off
the
place
with
a
he
waved
his
hand
in
the
air
it
sickening
impossible
as
for
you
two
he
added
turning
to
us
but
suddenly
stopped
hell
what
the
use
why
should
i
bother
with
you
do
as
you
damned
well
please
and
stay
sick
or
die
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
out
of
the
leaving
us
to
sit
there
i
was
so
dumbfounded
by
the
harangue
our
had
released
that
i
could
scarcely
speak
my
appetite
was
gone
and
i
felt
wretched
to
think
of
having
been
the
cause
of
this
unnecessary
to
the
others
and
i
felt
that
we
were
and
justly
the
target
for
their
rather
censorious
eyes
my
god
moaned
my
companion
most
dolefully
that
always
the
way
with
me
nothing
that
i
ever
do
comes
out
right
all
my
life
i
been
unlucky
my
mother
died
when
i
was
seven
and
my
father
never
had
any
use
for
me
i
started
in
three
or
four
businesses
four
or
five
years
ago
but
none
of
them
ever
came
out
right
my
yacht
burned
last
summer
and
i
had
neurasthenia
for
two
years
he
catalogued
a
list
of
ills
that
would
have
done
honor
to
job
himself
and
he
was
worth
nine
millions
so
i
heard
two
or
three
additional
and
amusing
incidents
and
i
am
done
one
of
the
most
outré
things
in
connection
with
our
rides
about
the
countryside
was
culhane
attitude
toward
life
and
the
natives
and
passing
strangers
as
representing
life
thus
one
day
as
i
recall
very
well
we
were
riding
along
a
backwoods
country
road
very
shadowy
and
a
great
company
of
us
four
abreast
when
suddenly
and
after
his
very
military
fashion
there
came
a
halt
right
by
fours
right
dress
face
and
presently
we
were
all
lined
up
in
a
row
facing
a
greensward
which
had
suddenly
been
revealed
to
the
left
and
on
which
and
before
a
small
plumber
stove
standing
outside
some
stable
was
stretched
a
plumber
and
his
helper
the
former
a
man
of
perhaps
the
latter
a
lad
of
say
fourteen
or
fifteen
were
both
very
grimy
and
dirty
but
taking
their
ease
in
the
morning
sun
a
little
pot
of
lead
on
the
stove
being
waited
for
i
presume
that
it
might
boil
culhane
leaving
his
place
at
the
head
of
the
column
returned
to
the
center
nearest
the
plumber
and
his
helper
and
pointing
at
them
and
addressing
us
in
a
very
clear
voice
said
there
you
have
it
there
american
labor
for
you
at
its
best
union
labor
the
poor
downtrodden
workingman
look
at
him
we
all
looked
this
poor
plumber
here
and
at
that
the
latter
stirred
and
sat
up
scarcely
even
now
grasping
what
it
was
all
about
so
suddenly
had
we
descended
upon
him
earns
or
demands
sixty
cents
an
hour
and
this
poor
sweating
little
helper
here
has
to
have
forty
they
working
now
they
waiting
for
that
little
bit
of
lead
to
boil
at
a
dollar
an
hour
between
them
they
ca
do
a
thing
either
of
until
it
does
and
lead
has
to
be
well
done
you
know
before
it
can
be
used
well
now
these
two
here
he
continued
suddenly
shifting
his
tone
from
one
of
light
sarcasm
to
a
kind
of
savage
contempt
imagine
they
are
getting
along
making
life
a
lot
better
for
themselves
when
they
lie
about
this
way
and
swindle
another
man
out
of
his
honest
due
in
connection
with
the
work
he
is
paying
for
he
ca
help
himself
he
ca
know
everything
if
he
did
he
probably
find
what
wrong
in
there
and
fix
it
himself
in
three
minutes
but
if
he
did
that
and
the
union
heard
of
it
they
boycott
him
they
come
around
and
blackmail
him
blow
up
his
barn
or
make
him
pay
for
the
work
he
did
himself
i
know
i
have
to
deal
with
they
fix
my
pipes
in
the
same
way
that
these
two
are
fixing
his
lying
on
the
grass
at
a
dollar
an
hour
and
they
want
five
dollars
a
pound
for
every
bit
of
lead
they
use
if
they
forget
anything
and
have
to
go
back
to
town
for
it
you
pay
for
it
at
a
dollar
an
hour
they
get
on
the
job
at
nine
and
quit
at
four
in
the
country
if
you
say
anything
they
quit
altogether
laborers
and
they
wo
let
any
one
else
do
it
either
once
they
on
the
job
they
have
to
rest
every
few
minutes
like
these
two
something
has
to
boil
or
they
have
to
wait
for
something
is
it
wonderful
is
it
beautiful
and
all
of
us
of
course
are
made
free
and
equal
they
just
as
good
as
we
are
if
you
work
and
make
money
and
have
any
plumbing
to
do
you
have
to
support
right
by
fours
guide
right
forward
and
off
we
trotted
breaking
into
a
headlong
gallop
a
little
farther
on
as
if
he
wished
to
outrun
the
mood
which
was
holding
him
at
the
moment
the
plumber
and
his
assistant
fully
awake
now
to
the
import
of
what
had
occurred
stared
after
us
the
journeyman
plumber
who
was
short
and
fat
sat
and
blinked
at
last
he
recovered
his
wits
sufficiently
to
cry
aw
go
to
hell
you
but
by
that
time
we
were
well
along
the
road
and
i
am
not
sure
that
culhane
even
heard
another
day
as
we
were
riding
along
a
road
which
led
into
a
nearby
city
of
say
twenty
thousand
we
encountered
a
beer
truck
of
great
size
and
on
its
seat
so
large
and
ruddy
and
obese
a
german
as
one
might
go
a
long
way
and
still
not
see
it
was
very
hot
the
german
was
drowsy
and
taking
his
time
in
the
matter
of
driving
as
we
drew
near
culhane
suddenly
called
a
halt
and
lining
us
up
as
was
his
rule
called
to
the
horses
of
the
brewery
wagon
who
also
obeyed
his
lusty
whoa
the
driver
from
his
high
perch
above
stared
down
on
us
with
mingled
curiosity
and
wonder
now
here
an
illustration
of
what
i
mean
culhane
began
apropos
of
nothing
at
all
when
i
say
that
the
word
man
ought
to
be
modified
or
changed
in
some
way
so
that
when
we
use
it
we
would
mean
something
more
definite
than
we
mean
now
that
thing
you
see
sitting
up
on
that
there
call
that
a
man
and
then
call
me
one
or
a
man
like
charles
dana
or
a
man
like
general
grant
hell
look
at
him
look
at
his
shape
look
at
that
stomach
you
think
a
thing
like
that
call
it
a
man
if
you
want
to
has
any
brains
or
that
he
really
any
better
than
a
pig
in
a
sty
if
you
turn
a
horse
out
to
shift
for
himself
he
eat
just
enough
to
keep
in
condition
same
way
with
a
dog
a
cat
or
a
bird
but
let
one
of
these
things
that
some
people
call
a
come
along
give
him
a
job
and
enough
money
or
a
chance
to
stuff
himself
and
see
what
happens
a
thing
like
that
connects
himself
with
one
end
of
a
beer
hose
and
then
he
thinks
he
all
right
he
gets
enough
guts
to
start
a
sausage
factory
and
then
he
blows
up
i
suppose
or
rots
think
of
it
and
we
call
him
a
man
or
some
do
during
this
amazing
and
wholly
unexpected
harangue
i
never
saw
him
stop
any
one
before
the
heavy
driver
who
did
not
understand
english
very
well
first
gazed
and
then
strained
with
his
eyebrows
not
being
able
quite
to
make
out
what
it
was
all
about
from
the
chuckling
and
laughter
that
finally
set
up
in
one
place
and
another
he
began
dimly
to
comprehend
that
he
was
being
made
fun
of
used
as
an
unsatisfactory
jest
of
some
kind
finally
his
face
clouded
for
a
storm
and
his
eyes
blazed
the
while
his
fat
red
cheeks
grew
redder
he
began
gutturally
to
roar
hunde
hunds
knoche
nach
der
polizei
soll
man
reufen
i
for
one
pulled
my
horse
cautiously
back
as
he
cracked
a
great
whip
and
charging
savagely
through
us
drove
on
culhane
having
made
his
unkind
comments
gave
orders
for
our
orderly
formation
once
more
and
calmly
led
us
away
perhaps
the
most
amusing
phase
of
him
was
his
opposition
to
and
contempt
for
inefficiency
of
any
kind
if
he
asked
you
to
do
anything
no
matter
what
and
you
did
at
once
leap
to
the
task
ready
and
willing
and
able
so
to
do
he
scarcely
had
words
enough
with
which
to
express
himself
on
one
occasion
as
i
recall
all
too
well
he
took
us
for
a
drive
in
his
one
or
two
or
three
that
he
possessed
a
great
lumbering
highly
lacquered
vehicle
to
which
he
attached
seven
or
eight
or
nine
horses
i
forget
which
this
ride
was
a
regular
sunday
morning
or
afternoon
affair
unless
it
was
raining
a
call
suddenly
sounding
from
about
the
grounds
somewhere
at
eleven
or
at
two
in
the
afternoon
at
or
as
the
case
might
be
all
aboard
gathering
all
the
reins
in
his
hands
and
perching
himself
in
the
high
seat
above
with
perhaps
one
of
his
guests
beside
him
all
the
rest
crowded
on
the
seats
within
and
on
top
he
would
carry
us
off
careening
about
the
countryside
most
madly
several
of
his
hostlers
acting
as
liveried
footmen
or
outriders
and
one
of
them
perched
up
behind
on
the
little
seat
the
technical
name
of
which
i
have
forgotten
waving
and
blowing
the
long
silver
trumpet
the
regulation
blasts
on
which
had
to
be
exactly
as
made
and
provided
for
such
occasions
often
having
been
given
no
warning
as
to
just
when
it
was
to
be
there
would
be
a
mad
scramble
to
get
into
our
sunday
clothes
for
culhane
would
not
endure
any
flaws
in
our
appearance
and
if
we
were
not
ready
and
waiting
when
one
of
his
stablemen
swung
the
vehicle
up
to
the
door
at
the
appointed
time
he
was
absolutely
furious
on
the
particular
occasion
i
have
in
mind
we
all
clambered
on
in
good
time
all
spick
and
span
and
in
our
very
best
shaved
powdered
hands
appropriately
gloved
our
whiskers
curled
and
parted
our
shoes
shined
our
hats
brushed
and
up
in
front
was
culhane
gentleman
de
luxe
for
the
occasion
his
whip
looped
exactly
as
it
should
be
no
doubt
ready
to
be
flicked
out
over
the
farthest
horse
head
and
up
behind
was
the
trumpeter
high
hat
boots
a
uniform
of
some
grand
color
i
forget
which
but
as
it
turned
out
on
this
occasion
there
had
been
a
hitch
at
the
last
minute
the
regular
hostler
or
stableman
who
acted
as
footman
extraordinary
and
trumpeter
plenipotentiary
the
one
who
could
truly
and
ably
blow
this
magnificent
horn
was
sick
or
his
mother
was
dead
at
any
rate
there
he
was
and
in
order
not
to
irritate
culhane
a
second
hostler
had
been
dressed
and
given
his
seat
and
horn
only
he
blow
it
as
we
began
to
clamber
in
i
heard
him
asking
can
any
of
you
gentleman
blow
the
trumpet
do
any
of
you
gentleman
know
the
regular
trumpet
call
no
one
responded
although
there
was
much
discussion
in
a
low
key
some
could
or
thought
they
could
but
hesitated
to
assume
so
frightful
a
risk
at
the
same
time
culhane
hearing
the
fuss
and
knowing
perhaps
that
his
substitute
could
not
trumpet
turned
grimly
around
and
said
say
do
you
mean
to
say
there
is
any
one
back
there
who
knows
how
to
blow
that
thing
what
the
matter
with
you
caswell
he
called
to
one
and
getting
only
mumbled
explanations
from
that
quarter
called
to
another
how
about
you
drewberry
or
you
crashaw
all
three
apologized
briskly
they
were
terrified
by
the
mere
thought
of
trying
indeed
no
one
seemed
eager
to
assume
the
responsibility
until
finally
he
became
so
threatening
and
assured
us
so
volubly
that
unless
some
immediate
and
cheerful
response
were
made
he
would
never
again
waste
one
blank
minute
on
a
lot
of
this
and
thats
that
one
youth
a
rash
young
society
somebody
from
rochester
volunteered
more
or
less
feebly
that
he
thought
that
maybe
he
could
manage
it
he
took
a
seat
directly
under
the
pompously
placed
trumpeter
and
we
were
off
out
the
gate
and
down
the
road
and
up
a
nearby
slope
at
a
smart
clip
all
of
us
gazing
cheerfully
and
possibly
vainly
about
for
it
was
a
bright
day
and
a
gay
country
now
the
trumpeter
as
is
provided
for
on
all
such
occasions
lifted
the
trumpet
to
his
lips
and
began
on
the
grandiose
but
to
our
grief
and
pain
although
he
got
through
fairly
successfully
on
his
first
attempt
there
was
one
place
where
there
was
a
slight
hitch
a
false
crack
as
some
one
rowdyishly
remarked
culhane
although
tucking
up
his
lines
and
stiffening
his
back
irritably
at
this
flaw
said
nothing
for
after
all
a
poor
trumpeter
was
better
than
none
at
all
a
little
later
however
the
trumpeter
having
hesitated
to
begin
again
he
called
back
well
what
about
the
horn
what
about
the
horn
ca
you
do
something
with
it
have
you
quit
for
the
day
up
went
the
horn
once
more
and
a
most
noble
and
encouraging
was
begun
but
just
at
the
critical
point
and
when
we
were
all
most
prayerfully
hoping
against
hope
as
it
were
that
this
time
he
would
round
the
dangerous
curves
of
it
gracefully
and
come
to
a
grand
finish
there
was
a
most
disconcerting
and
disheartening
squeak
it
was
pathetic
ghastly
as
one
man
we
wilted
what
would
culhane
say
to
that
we
were
not
long
in
doubt
great
christ
he
shouted
looking
back
and
showing
a
countenance
so
black
that
it
was
positively
terrifying
who
did
that
throw
him
off
what
do
you
think
that
i
want
the
whole
country
to
know
i
airing
a
lot
of
lunatics
somebody
who
can
blow
that
thing
take
it
and
blow
it
for
god
sake
i
not
going
to
drive
around
here
without
a
trumpeter
for
a
few
moments
there
was
more
or
less
painful
gabbling
in
all
the
rows
pathetic
whisperings
and
go
ons
or
eager
urgings
of
one
and
another
to
sacrifice
himself
upon
the
altar
of
necessity
insistences
by
the
that
he
had
blown
trumpets
in
his
day
as
good
as
any
one
what
the
deuce
had
got
into
him
anyhow
it
must
be
the
horn
well
shouted
culhane
finally
as
a
to
all
this
is
any
one
going
to
blow
that
thing
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
i
hauling
all
of
you
around
with
not
a
man
among
you
able
to
blow
a
dinky
little
horn
what
the
use
of
my
keeping
a
lot
of
fancy
vehicles
in
my
barn
when
all
i
have
to
deal
with
is
a
lot
of
shoe
salesmen
and
floorwalkers
hell
any
child
can
blow
it
it
as
easy
as
a
if
i
these
horses
to
attend
to
i
blow
it
myself
come
on
come
on
kerrigan
what
the
matter
with
you
blowing
it
the
truth
is
culhane
explained
kerrigan
the
very
dapper
and
polite
heir
of
a
philadelphia
starch
millionaire
i
have
had
any
chance
to
practice
with
one
of
those
for
several
years
i
try
it
if
you
want
me
to
but
i
ca
guarantee
try
insisted
culhane
violently
you
ca
do
any
worse
than
that
other
mutt
if
you
blow
for
a
million
years
blow
it
blow
it
kerrigan
turned
back
and
being
very
cheerfully
tendered
the
horn
by
the
last
failure
wetted
and
adjusted
his
lips
lifted
it
upward
and
backward
and
it
was
pathetic
it
was
positively
dreadful
the
wheezing
grinding
sounds
that
were
emitted
god
shouted
culhane
pulling
up
the
coach
to
a
dead
stop
stop
that
whoa
whoa
do
you
mean
to
say
that
that
the
best
you
can
do
well
this
finishes
me
whoa
what
kind
of
a
bunch
of
cattle
have
i
got
up
here
anyhow
whoa
and
out
in
this
country
too
where
i
known
and
where
they
know
all
about
such
things
god
whoa
here
i
spend
thousands
of
dollars
to
get
together
an
equipment
that
will
make
a
pleasant
afternoon
for
a
crowd
of
gentlemen
and
this
is
what
i
draw
hams
a
lot
of
barflies
who
never
saw
a
well
i
done
i
through
split
the
damned
thing
up
for
firewood
before
i
ever
take
it
out
again
get
down
get
out
all
of
you
i
not
haul
one
of
you
back
a
step
walk
back
or
anywhere
you
please
to
hell
for
all
i
care
i
through
get
out
i
going
to
turn
around
and
get
back
to
the
barn
as
quick
as
i
can
up
some
alley
if
i
can
find
one
to
think
of
having
such
a
bunch
of
hacks
to
deal
with
humbly
and
wearily
we
climbed
down
and
while
he
drove
savagely
on
to
some
stood
about
first
in
small
groups
then
by
twos
and
threes
began
making
our
way
rather
gingerly
i
must
confess
in
our
fine
clothes
along
the
winding
road
back
to
the
place
on
the
hill
but
such
swearing
such
comments
the
number
of
times
his
sturdy
irish
soul
was
wished
into
innermost
and
almost
sacrosanct
portions
of
sheol
he
was
cursed
from
more
angles
and
in
more
artistically
and
architecturally
nobly
constructed
phrases
and
even
paragraphs
than
any
human
being
that
i
have
ever
heard
of
before
or
since
phrases
so
livid
and
glistening
that
they
smoked
talk
about
the
carved
ivories
of
speech
the
mosaics
of
verbal
precious
stones
you
should
have
heard
us
on
our
way
back
and
still
we
stayed
some
two
years
later
i
was
passing
this
place
in
company
with
some
friends
when
i
asked
my
host
who
also
knew
of
the
place
to
turn
in
during
my
stay
it
had
been
the
privilege
and
custom
among
those
who
knew
much
of
this
institution
to
drive
through
the
grounds
and
past
the
very
doors
of
the
repair
shop
even
to
stop
if
culhane
chanced
to
be
visible
and
talking
to
or
at
least
greeting
him
in
some
cases
a
custom
of
culhane
was
in
the
summer
time
to
have
erected
on
the
lawn
a
large
striped
marquee
tent
a
very
handsome
thing
indeed
in
which
was
placed
a
table
and
several
camp
chairs
and
some
books
and
papers
here
of
a
hot
day
when
he
was
not
busy
with
us
he
would
sit
and
read
and
when
he
was
in
here
or
somewhere
about
a
little
pennant
was
run
up
possibly
as
guide
to
visiting
guests
or
friends
at
any
rate
it
was
the
presence
of
this
pennant
which
caused
me
to
know
that
he
was
about
and
to
wish
that
i
might
have
a
look
at
him
once
more
great
lion
that
he
was
as
guests
none
of
us
were
ever
allowed
to
come
within
more
than
ten
feet
of
it
let
alone
in
it
as
passing
visitors
however
we
might
and
many
did
stop
remind
him
that
we
had
once
been
his
humble
slaves
and
ask
leave
to
congratulate
him
on
his
health
and
sturdy
years
at
such
times
if
the
visitors
looked
interesting
enough
or
he
remembered
them
well
he
would
deign
to
come
to
the
and
standing
there
à
la
napoleon
at
lodi
or
grant
in
the
wilderness
be
for
the
first
time
in
his
relations
with
them
a
bit
civil
anyway
on
this
occasion
urged
on
by
curiosity
to
see
my
liege
once
more
and
also
to
learn
whether
he
would
remember
me
at
all
i
had
my
present
host
roll
his
car
up
to
the
tent
door
where
culhane
was
reading
feeling
that
by
this
venturesome
deed
i
had
let
myself
in
for
it
and
had
to
make
a
showing
i
climbed
briskly
out
and
approaching
recalled
myself
to
him
with
a
expression
half
smile
half
contemptuous
curl
of
the
corners
of
his
mouth
he
recalled
me
and
took
my
extended
hand
then
seeing
that
possibly
my
friends
if
not
myself
looked
interesting
he
arose
and
came
to
the
door
i
introduced
them
one
a
naval
officer
of
distinction
the
other
the
owner
of
a
great
estate
some
miles
farther
on
for
the
first
time
in
my
relations
with
him
i
had
an
opportunity
to
note
how
grandly
gracious
he
could
be
he
accepted
my
friends
congratulations
as
to
the
view
with
a
princely
nod
and
suggested
that
on
other
days
it
was
even
better
he
was
soon
to
be
busy
now
or
he
would
have
some
one
show
my
friends
through
the
shop
some
saturday
afternoon
if
they
would
telephone
or
stop
in
passing
he
would
oblige
i
noted
at
once
that
he
had
not
aged
in
the
least
he
was
or
now
and
as
vigorous
and
trim
as
ever
and
now
he
treated
me
as
courteously
and
formally
as
though
he
had
never
browbeaten
me
in
the
least
good
heavens
i
said
how
much
better
to
be
a
visitor
than
a
guest
after
a
moment
or
two
we
offered
many
thanks
and
sped
on
but
not
without
many
a
backward
glance
on
my
part
for
the
place
fascinated
me
that
simply
furnished
institution
that
severe
regimen
this
stoic
and
spartan
in
his
tent
and
above
all
things
and
the
most
astounding
to
me
so
little
could
one
know
him
the
book
he
had
been
reading
and
which
he
had
laid
upon
his
little
table
as
i
entered
i
could
not
help
noting
the
title
for
he
laid
it
back
up
open
face
down
was
lecky
history
of
european
morals
now
well
in
retrospect
two
years
after
this
visit
in
a
serious
attempt
to
set
down
what
i
really
did
think
of
him
i
arranged
the
following
thoughts
with
which
i
closed
my
sketch
then
and
which
i
now
append
for
what
they
may
be
worth
they
represented
my
best
thought
concerning
him
then
thomas
culhane
belongs
to
that
class
of
society
which
the
preachers
and
the
world
army
of
conventional
merchants
lawyers
judges
and
reputable
citizens
generally
are
presumably
if
one
may
judge
by
the
moral
and
religious
literature
of
the
day
trying
to
reach
and
reform
yet
here
at
his
sanitarium
are
gathered
representatives
of
those
same
orders
the
better
element
and
here
we
see
them
suddenly
dominated
mind
and
soul
by
this
being
whom
they
theoretically
at
least
look
upon
as
a
brand
to
be
snatched
from
the
burning
as
the
church
and
society
view
culhane
so
they
view
all
life
outside
their
own
immediate
circles
culhane
is
in
fact
a
conspicuous
figure
among
the
he
has
been
referred
to
in
many
an
argument
and
platform
and
pulpit
and
in
the
press
as
a
type
of
man
whose
influence
is
supposed
to
be
vitiating
now
a
minister
enters
the
sanitarium
broken
down
by
his
habits
of
life
and
this
same
culhane
is
able
to
penetrate
him
to
see
that
his
dogmatic
and
dictatorial
mental
habits
are
the
cause
of
his
ailment
and
he
has
the
moral
courage
to
shock
him
to
drag
him
by
apparently
brutal
processes
out
of
his
rut
he
reads
the
man
accurately
he
knows
him
better
than
he
knows
himself
and
he
effects
a
cure
this
astonishing
condition
is
certainly
a
new
light
for
those
seeking
to
labor
among
men
those
who
are
successful
gamblers
pugilists
pickpockets
jockeys
and
the
like
are
so
by
reason
of
their
intelligence
their
innate
mental
acumen
and
perception
it
is
a
fact
that
in
the
sporting
world
and
among
the
unconventional
you
will
often
find
as
good
if
not
better
judges
of
human
nature
than
elsewhere
contact
with
a
rough
and
ready
and
world
teaches
them
much
the
world
customary
pretensions
and
delusions
are
in
the
main
ripped
away
they
are
bruised
by
rough
facts
often
the
men
gathered
in
some
such
café
and
whom
preachers
and
moralists
are
most
ready
to
condemn
have
a
clearer
perception
of
preachers
church
organizations
and
reformers
and
their
relative
importance
in
the
multitudinous
life
of
the
world
than
the
preachers
church
congregations
and
reformers
have
of
those
in
the
café
or
the
world
outside
to
which
they
belong
this
is
why
in
my
humble
judgment
the
church
and
those
associated
with
its
aims
make
no
more
progress
than
they
do
while
they
are
consciously
eager
to
better
the
world
they
are
so
wrapped
up
in
themselves
and
their
theories
so
hampered
by
their
arbitrary
and
limited
conceptions
of
good
and
evil
that
the
great
majority
of
men
move
about
them
unseen
except
in
a
and
superficial
manner
men
are
not
influenced
at
arm
length
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
if
some
day
a
preacher
or
judge
who
offended
by
culhane
profanity
and
brutality
will
be
able
to
reach
the
gladiator
and
convert
him
to
his
views
as
readily
as
the
gladiator
is
able
to
rid
him
of
his
ailment
in
justice
to
the
preachers
moralists
et
cetera
i
should
now
like
to
add
that
it
is
probably
not
any
of
the
virtues
or
perfections
represented
by
a
man
like
culhane
with
which
they
are
quarreling
but
the
vices
of
many
who
are
in
no
wise
like
him
and
do
not
stand
for
the
things
he
stands
for
at
the
same
time
the
sports
might
well
reply
that
it
is
not
with
any
of
the
really
admirable
qualities
of
the
unco
guid
that
they
quarrel
but
their
too
narrow
interpretations
of
virtue
and
duty
and
their
groundless
generalization
as
to
types
and
classes
be
it
so
here
is
meat
for
a
thousand
controversies
true
in
the
streets
of
a
certain
county
seat
in
missouri
not
many
years
ago
might
have
been
seen
a
true
patriarch
tall
stout
in
body
and
mind
he
roamed
among
his
neighbors
dispensing
sympathy
and
a
curiously
genial
human
interest
through
the
leisure
of
his
day
one
might
have
taken
him
to
be
walt
whitman
of
whom
he
was
the
living
counterpart
or
in
the
clear
eye
high
forehead
and
thick
appealing
white
hair
have
seen
a
marked
similarity
to
bryant
as
he
appeared
in
his
later
years
already
at
this
time
he
had
seen
allotted
term
on
earth
and
yet
he
was
still
strong
in
the
councils
of
his
people
and
rich
in
the
accumulated
interests
of
a
lifetime
at
the
particular
time
in
question
he
was
most
interesting
for
the
eccentricities
which
years
of
stalwart
independence
had
developed
but
these
were
lovable
peculiarities
and
only
severed
from
remarkable
actions
by
the
compelling
power
of
time
and
his
increasing
infirmities
the
loud
though
pleasant
voice
and
strong
often
fiery
declamatory
manner
were
remnants
of
the
days
when
his
were
wholly
swayed
by
the
magnificence
of
his
orations
charmingly
simple
in
manner
he
still
represented
with
it
that
old
courtesy
which
made
every
stranger
his
guest
when
moved
by
righteous
indignation
there
cropped
out
the
daring
and
domineering
insistence
of
one
who
had
always
followed
what
he
considered
to
be
the
right
and
who
knew
its
power
even
then
old
as
he
was
if
there
were
any
topic
worthy
of
discussion
and
his
were
in
danger
of
going
wrong
he
became
an
haranguing
prophet
as
it
were
a
local
isaiah
or
jeremiah
every
gate
heard
him
for
he
stopped
on
his
rounds
in
front
of
each
and
calling
out
the
inhabitant
poured
forth
such
a
volume
of
fact
and
argument
as
tended
to
remove
all
doubt
of
what
he
at
least
considered
right
all
of
this
he
invariably
accompanied
by
a
magnificence
of
gesture
worthy
of
a
great
orator
at
such
times
his
mind
apparently
was
almost
wholly
engrossed
with
these
matters
and
i
have
it
from
one
of
his
daughters
who
besides
being
his
daughter
was
a
sincere
admirer
of
his
that
often
he
might
have
been
seen
coming
down
his
private
lawn
and
even
the
public
streets
when
there
was
no
one
near
to
hear
him
shaking
his
head
gesticulating
sometimes
sweeping
upward
with
his
arms
as
if
addressing
his
in
assemblage
he
used
to
push
his
big
hat
well
back
upon
his
forehead
she
said
on
one
occasion
and
often
in
winter
forgetful
of
the
bitter
cold
would
take
off
his
overcoat
and
carry
it
on
his
arm
occasionally
he
would
stop
quite
still
as
if
he
were
addressing
a
companion
and
with
sweeping
gestures
illustrate
some
idea
or
other
although
of
course
there
was
no
one
present
then
planting
his
big
cane
forcibly
with
each
step
as
though
still
emphasizing
his
recently
stated
ideas
he
would
come
forward
and
enter
the
house
the
same
suggestion
of
mental
concentration
might
have
been
seen
in
everything
that
he
did
and
i
personally
have
seen
him
leading
a
pet
jersey
cow
home
for
milking
with
the
same
dignity
of
bearing
and
forcefulness
of
manner
that
characterized
him
when
he
stood
before
his
at
a
public
meeting
addressing
them
on
some
important
topic
he
never
appeared
to
have
a
sense
of
difference
from
or
superiority
over
his
fellowmen
but
only
the
keenest
sympathy
with
all
things
human
every
man
was
his
brother
every
human
being
honest
a
cow
or
a
horse
was
as
much
to
be
treated
with
sympathy
and
charity
as
a
man
or
a
woman
if
a
purse
was
lost
out
of
every
fifty
men
would
return
it
without
thought
of
reward
if
you
were
to
believe
him
in
the
little
town
where
he
had
lived
so
many
years
and
where
he
finally
died
he
knew
every
living
creature
from
cattle
upwards
and
could
call
each
by
name
the
sick
the
poor
the
widows
the
orphans
the
insane
and
dependents
of
all
kinds
were
his
especial
care
every
sunday
afternoon
for
years
it
was
his
custom
to
go
the
rounds
of
the
indigent
frequently
carrying
a
basket
of
his
good
wife
dinner
this
he
distributed
along
with
consolation
and
advice
occasionally
he
would
return
home
of
a
winter
day
very
much
engrossed
with
the
discovery
of
some
condition
of
distress
hitherto
unseen
mother
he
would
say
to
his
wife
in
that
same
oratorical
manner
previously
noted
as
he
entered
the
house
i
found
such
a
poor
family
they
have
moved
into
the
old
saloon
below
solmson
you
know
how
open
that
is
this
was
delivered
in
the
most
dramatic
style
after
he
had
indicated
something
important
by
throwing
his
overcoat
on
the
bed
and
standing
his
cane
in
the
corner
there
a
man
and
several
children
there
the
mother
is
dead
they
were
on
their
way
to
kansas
but
it
got
so
cold
they
had
to
stop
here
until
the
winter
is
broken
without
food
almost
no
clothing
ca
we
find
something
for
them
on
these
occasions
said
his
daughter
to
me
once
he
would
as
he
nearly
always
did
talk
to
himself
on
the
way
as
if
he
were
discussing
politics
but
you
could
never
tell
what
he
was
coming
for
then
with
his
own
labor
he
would
help
his
wife
seek
out
the
odds
and
ends
that
could
be
spared
and
so
armed
would
return
arguing
by
the
way
as
if
an
errand
of
mercy
were
the
last
thing
he
contemplated
nearly
always
the
subject
of
these
orations
was
some
public
wrong
or
error
which
should
receive
although
in
all
likelihood
it
did
not
immediate
attention
always
of
a
reverent
although
not
exactly
religious
turn
of
mind
he
took
considerable
interest
in
religious
ministration
though
he
steadily
and
persistently
refused
in
his
later
years
to
go
to
church
he
had
james
formula
to
quote
in
which
insists
that
pure
religion
and
undefiled
before
our
god
and
father
is
this
to
visit
the
fatherless
and
widows
in
their
affliction
and
to
keep
himself
unspotted
from
the
world
often
when
pressed
too
close
he
would
deliver
this
with
kindly
violence
one
of
the
most
touching
anecdotes
representative
of
this
was
related
to
me
by
his
daughter
who
said
kent
a
poor
man
of
our
town
was
sick
for
months
previous
to
his
death
and
my
father
used
to
go
often
sometimes
daily
to
visit
him
he
would
spend
perhaps
a
few
minutes
perhaps
an
hour
with
him
singing
praying
and
ministering
to
his
spiritual
wants
the
pastor
of
the
church
living
so
far
away
and
coming
only
once
a
month
this
duty
devolved
upon
some
one
and
my
father
did
his
share
and
always
felt
more
than
repaid
for
the
time
spent
by
the
gratitude
shown
by
the
many
poor
people
he
aided
in
this
way
kent
favorite
song
for
instance
was
jordan
stormy
banks
i
stand
this
he
would
have
my
father
sing
and
his
clear
voice
could
often
be
heard
in
the
latter
small
house
and
seemed
to
impart
strength
to
the
sick
man
upon
one
occasion
i
remember
kent
expressed
a
desire
to
hear
a
certain
song
my
father
was
not
very
familiar
with
it
but
anxious
to
grant
his
request
came
home
and
asked
me
if
i
would
get
a
friend
of
mine
and
go
and
sing
the
song
for
him
we
entered
the
he
leading
us
by
the
hand
for
we
were
children
at
the
time
kent
face
at
once
brightened
and
father
said
to
him
kent
i
told
you
this
morning
that
i
could
sing
the
song
you
asked
for
but
these
girls
know
it
and
have
come
to
sing
it
for
you
then
waving
his
hand
gently
toward
us
he
said
children
we
did
so
and
when
we
had
finished
he
knelt
and
offered
a
prayer
not
for
the
poor
man
recovery
but
that
he
might
put
his
trust
in
the
lord
and
meet
death
without
fear
i
have
never
been
more
deeply
impressed
nor
felt
more
confident
in
the
presence
of
death
for
the
man
died
soon
after
soothed
into
perfect
peace
on
another
occasion
he
was
sitting
with
some
friends
in
front
of
the
courthouse
in
his
town
talking
and
sunning
himself
when
a
neighbor
came
running
up
in
great
excitement
calling
white
white
come
right
quick
sadler
wants
you
he
explained
that
the
woman
in
question
was
dying
and
being
afraid
she
would
strangle
in
her
last
moments
had
asked
the
bystanders
to
run
for
him
her
old
acquaintance
in
the
efficacy
of
whose
prayers
she
had
great
faith
the
old
patriarch
was
without
a
coat
at
the
time
but
unmindful
of
that
hastened
after
white
exclaimed
the
sick
woman
excitedly
upon
seeing
him
i
want
you
to
pray
that
i
wo
strangle
i
not
afraid
to
die
but
i
want
to
die
that
way
i
want
you
to
offer
a
prayer
for
me
that
i
may
be
saved
from
that
i
so
afraid
seeing
by
the
woman
manner
that
she
was
very
much
overwrought
he
used
all
his
art
to
soothe
her
have
no
fear
sadler
now
he
exclaimed
solemnly
you
strangle
i
will
ask
the
lord
for
you
and
this
evil
will
not
come
upon
you
you
need
not
have
any
fear
kneel
down
you
he
commanded
turning
upon
the
assembled
neighbors
and
relatives
who
had
followed
or
had
been
there
before
him
while
he
pushed
back
his
white
hair
from
his
forehead
let
us
now
pray
that
this
good
woman
here
be
allowed
to
pass
away
in
peace
and
even
with
the
rustle
of
kneeling
that
accompanied
his
words
he
lifted
up
his
coatless
arms
and
began
to
pray
through
his
magnificent
phraseology
no
doubt
as
well
as
his
profound
faith
he
succeeded
in
inducing
a
feeling
of
peace
and
quiet
in
all
his
hearers
the
sick
woman
included
who
listening
sank
into
a
restful
stupor
from
which
all
agony
of
mind
had
apparently
disappeared
then
when
the
physical
atmosphere
of
the
room
had
been
thus
reorganized
he
ceased
and
retired
to
the
yard
in
front
of
the
house
where
on
a
bench
under
a
shade
tree
he
seated
himself
to
wipe
his
moist
brow
and
recover
his
composure
in
a
few
moments
a
slight
commotion
in
the
denoted
that
the
end
had
come
several
neighbors
came
out
and
one
said
well
it
is
all
over
white
she
is
dead
yes
he
replied
with
great
assurance
she
did
strangle
did
she
no
said
the
other
the
lord
granted
her
request
i
knew
he
would
he
replied
in
his
customary
loud
and
confident
tone
prayer
is
always
answered
then
after
viewing
the
dead
woman
and
making
additional
comments
he
was
off
as
placid
as
though
nothing
had
occurred
i
happened
to
hear
of
this
some
time
after
and
one
day
while
sitting
with
him
on
his
front
porch
said
white
do
you
really
believe
that
the
lord
directly
answered
your
prayer
in
that
instance
answered
he
almost
shouted
defiantly
and
yet
with
a
kind
of
human
tenderness
that
one
could
never
mistake
of
course
he
answered
why
would
he
a
faithful
old
servant
like
that
to
be
sure
he
answered
might
it
not
have
been
merely
the
change
of
atmosphere
which
your
voice
and
strength
introduced
the
quality
of
your
own
thoughts
goes
for
something
in
such
matters
mind
acts
on
mind
certainly
he
said
in
a
manner
as
agreeable
as
if
it
had
always
been
a
doctrine
with
him
i
know
that
but
after
all
what
is
my
mind
your
mind
the
sound
of
voices
it
all
the
lord
anyhow
whatever
you
think
how
could
one
gainsay
such
a
religionist
as
that
the
poor
the
blind
the
insane
and
sufferers
of
all
sorts
as
i
have
said
before
were
always
objects
of
his
keenest
sympathies
evidence
of
it
flashed
out
at
the
most
unexpected
moments
loud
rough
exclamations
which
however
always
contained
a
note
so
tender
and
suggestive
as
to
defy
translation
thus
while
we
were
sitting
on
his
front
porch
one
day
and
hotly
discussing
politics
to
while
away
a
dull
afternoon
there
came
down
the
street
past
his
home
a
queer
ragged
individual
who
gazed
about
in
an
aimless
sort
of
way
peering
queerly
over
fences
looking
idly
down
the
road
staring
strangely
overhead
into
the
blue
it
was
apparent
in
a
moment
that
the
man
was
crazy
some
demented
creature
harmless
enough
however
to
be
allowed
abroad
and
so
save
the
county
the
expense
of
caring
for
him
the
old
man
broke
a
sentence
short
in
order
to
point
and
shake
his
head
emotionally
look
at
that
he
said
to
me
with
a
pathetic
sweep
of
the
arm
now
just
look
at
that
there
a
poor
demented
soul
with
no
one
to
look
after
him
his
brother
is
a
saddler
his
sister
is
dead
no
money
to
speak
of
any
of
them
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
added
i
do
know
what
we
to
do
in
such
cases
the
state
and
the
county
do
always
do
their
duty
most
people
here
are
too
poor
to
help
there
are
so
many
to
be
taken
care
of
it
seems
almost
at
times
as
if
you
ca
do
anything
but
leave
them
to
the
mercy
of
god
and
yet
you
do
that
either
quite
and
he
once
more
shook
his
head
sadly
i
was
for
denouncing
the
county
but
he
explained
very
charitably
that
it
was
already
very
heavily
taxed
by
such
cases
he
did
not
seem
to
know
exactly
what
should
be
done
at
the
time
but
he
was
very
sorry
very
and
for
the
time
being
the
warm
argument
in
which
he
had
been
indulging
was
completely
forgotten
now
he
lapsed
into
silence
and
all
communication
was
suspended
while
he
rocked
silently
in
his
great
chair
and
thought
one
day
in
passing
the
local
and
this
is
of
my
own
knowledge
he
came
upon
a
man
beating
a
poor
idiot
with
a
whip
the
latter
was
incapable
of
reasoning
and
therefore
of
understanding
why
it
was
that
he
was
being
beaten
the
two
were
beside
a
and
the
demented
one
was
crying
in
a
moment
the
old
patriarch
had
jumped
out
of
his
conveyance
leaped
over
the
fence
and
confronted
the
amazed
attendant
with
an
uplifted
arm
not
another
lick
he
fairly
shouted
what
do
you
mean
by
striking
an
idiot
why
explained
the
attendant
i
want
him
to
carry
in
the
wood
and
he
wo
do
it
it
is
not
his
place
to
bring
in
the
wood
he
is
put
here
for
that
and
in
the
next
place
he
ca
understand
what
you
mean
he
put
here
to
be
taken
care
of
do
you
dare
strike
him
again
i
see
about
this
and
you
knowing
his
interrupter
well
his
position
and
power
in
the
community
the
man
endeavored
to
explain
that
some
work
must
be
done
by
the
inmates
and
that
this
one
was
refractory
the
only
way
he
had
of
making
him
understand
was
by
whipping
him
not
another
word
the
old
man
blustered
overawing
the
county
hireling
you
done
a
wrong
and
you
know
it
i
see
to
this
and
off
he
bustled
to
the
county
courthouse
leaving
the
transgressor
so
badly
frightened
that
whips
thereafter
were
carefully
concealed
in
this
institution
at
least
the
court
which
was
held
in
his
home
town
was
not
in
session
at
the
time
and
only
the
clerk
was
present
when
he
came
tramping
down
the
aisle
and
stood
before
the
latter
with
his
right
hand
uplifted
in
the
position
of
one
about
to
make
oath
swear
me
he
called
solemnly
and
without
further
explanation
as
the
latter
stared
at
him
i
want
you
to
take
this
testimony
under
oath
the
clerk
knew
well
enough
the
remarkable
characteristics
of
his
guest
whose
actions
were
only
too
often
inexplicable
from
the
ground
point
of
policy
and
convention
without
ado
after
swearing
him
he
got
out
ink
and
paper
and
the
patriarch
began
i
saw
he
said
in
the
yard
of
the
county
farm
of
this
county
not
over
an
hour
ago
a
poor
helpless
idiot
too
to
understand
what
was
required
of
him
and
put
in
that
institution
by
the
people
of
this
county
to
be
cared
for
being
beaten
with
a
cowhide
by
mark
sheffels
who
is
an
attendant
there
because
the
idiot
did
not
understand
enough
to
carry
in
wood
which
the
people
have
hired
mark
sheffels
to
carry
in
think
of
it
he
added
quite
forgetting
the
nature
of
his
testimony
and
that
he
was
now
speaking
for
dictation
and
not
for
an
audience
to
hear
and
going
off
into
a
most
scorching
and
brilliant
arraignment
of
the
entire
system
in
which
such
brutality
could
occur
a
poor
helpless
idiot
unable
to
frame
in
his
own
disordered
mind
a
single
clear
sentence
being
beaten
by
a
sensible
healthy
brute
too
lazy
and
trifling
to
perform
the
duties
for
which
he
was
hired
and
which
he
personally
is
supposed
to
perform
there
was
more
to
the
effect
for
instance
that
the
american
people
and
the
people
of
this
county
should
be
ashamed
to
think
that
such
crimes
should
be
permitted
and
go
unpunished
and
that
this
was
a
fair
sample
the
clerk
realizing
the
importance
of
white
in
the
community
and
the
likelihood
of
his
following
up
his
charges
very
vigorously
quietly
followed
his
address
in
a
very
deferential
way
jotting
down
such
salient
features
as
he
had
time
to
write
when
he
was
through
however
he
ventured
to
lift
his
voice
in
protest
you
know
white
he
said
sheffels
is
a
member
of
our
party
and
was
appointed
by
us
of
course
now
it
too
bad
that
this
thing
should
have
happened
and
he
ought
to
be
dropped
but
if
you
are
going
to
make
a
public
matter
of
it
in
this
way
it
may
hurt
us
in
the
election
next
month
the
old
patriarch
threw
back
his
head
and
gazed
at
him
in
the
most
blazing
way
almost
without
comprehension
apparently
of
so
petty
a
view
what
he
exclaimed
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
do
you
want
the
democratic
party
to
starve
the
poor
and
beat
the
insane
the
opposition
was
rather
flattened
by
the
reply
and
left
the
old
gentleman
to
storm
out
for
once
at
least
in
this
particular
instance
anyhow
he
had
purified
the
political
atmosphere
as
if
by
lightning
and
within
the
month
following
the
offending
attendant
was
dropped
politics
however
had
long
known
his
influence
in
a
similar
way
there
was
a
time
when
he
was
the
chief
political
figure
in
the
county
and
possessed
the
gift
of
oratory
apparently
beyond
that
of
any
of
his
men
came
miles
to
hear
him
and
he
took
occasion
to
voice
his
views
on
every
important
issue
it
was
his
custom
in
those
days
for
instance
when
he
had
anything
of
special
importance
to
say
to
have
printed
at
his
own
expense
a
few
placards
announcing
his
coming
which
he
would
then
carry
to
the
town
selected
for
his
address
and
personally
nail
up
when
the
hour
came
a
crowd
as
i
am
told
was
never
wanting
citizens
and
farmers
of
both
parties
for
miles
about
usually
came
to
hear
him
personally
i
never
knew
how
towering
his
figure
had
been
in
the
past
or
how
truly
he
had
been
admired
until
one
day
i
drifted
in
upon
a
lone
bachelor
who
occupied
a
hut
some
fifteen
miles
from
the
patriarch
home
and
who
was
rather
noted
in
the
community
at
the
time
that
i
was
there
for
his
love
of
seclusion
and
indifference
to
current
events
he
had
not
visited
the
nearest
neighboring
village
in
something
like
five
years
and
had
not
been
to
the
county
seat
in
ten
naturally
he
treasured
memories
of
his
younger
days
and
more
varied
activity
i
do
know
he
said
to
me
one
day
in
discussing
modern
statesmen
and
political
fame
in
general
but
getting
up
in
politics
is
a
queer
game
i
ca
understand
it
men
that
you
think
ought
to
get
up
seem
to
it
does
seem
to
be
real
greatness
that
helps
along
what
makes
you
say
that
i
asked
well
there
used
to
be
a
man
over
here
at
danville
that
i
always
thought
would
get
up
and
yet
he
did
he
was
the
finest
orator
i
ever
heard
who
was
he
i
asked
arch
white
he
said
quietly
he
was
really
a
great
man
he
was
a
good
man
why
many
the
time
i
driven
fifteen
miles
to
hear
him
i
used
to
like
to
go
into
danville
just
for
that
reason
he
used
to
be
around
there
and
sometimes
he
talk
a
little
he
could
stir
a
fellow
up
oratory
alone
wo
make
a
statesman
i
ventured
more
to
draw
him
out
than
to
object
oh
i
know
he
answered
but
white
was
a
good
man
the
fellow
i
ever
heard
he
seemed
to
be
able
to
tell
us
just
what
was
the
matter
with
us
or
at
least
i
thought
so
he
always
seemed
a
wonderful
speaker
to
me
i
seen
as
many
as
two
thousand
people
up
at
high
hill
hollerin
over
what
he
was
saying
until
you
could
hear
them
for
miles
why
did
he
get
up
then
do
you
suppose
i
now
asked
on
my
part
i
dunno
he
answered
guess
he
was
too
honest
maybe
it
sometimes
that
way
in
politics
you
know
he
was
a
mighty
determined
man
and
one
that
would
talk
out
in
convention
whatever
happened
whenever
they
got
to
twisting
things
too
much
and
doing
what
was
just
honest
i
suppose
he
kick
out
anyhow
he
did
get
up
and
i
always
wondered
at
it
in
danville
one
might
hear
other
stories
wholly
bearing
out
this
latter
opinion
and
always
interesting
delightful
really
thus
a
long
enduring
political
quarrel
was
once
generated
by
an
incident
of
no
great
importance
save
that
it
revealed
an
odd
streak
in
the
old
character
and
his
interpretation
of
charity
and
duty
a
certain
young
man
well
known
to
the
people
of
this
county
and
to
the
patriarch
came
to
danville
one
day
and
either
drank
up
or
gambled
away
a
certain
sum
of
money
intrusted
to
him
by
his
aunt
for
disposition
in
an
entirely
different
manner
when
the
day
was
all
over
however
he
was
not
too
drunk
to
realize
that
he
was
in
a
rather
serious
predicament
and
so
riding
out
of
town
traveled
a
little
way
and
then
tearing
his
clothes
and
marking
his
skin
returned
complaining
that
he
had
been
set
upon
by
the
wayside
beaten
and
finally
robbed
his
clothes
were
in
a
fine
state
of
dilapidation
after
his
efforts
and
even
his
body
bore
marks
which
amply
seconded
his
protestation
in
the
slush
and
rain
of
the
dark
village
street
he
was
finally
picked
up
by
the
county
treasurer
seemingly
in
a
wretched
state
and
the
latter
knowing
the
generosity
of
white
and
the
fact
that
his
door
was
always
open
to
those
in
distress
took
the
young
man
by
the
arm
and
led
him
to
the
door
where
he
personally
applied
for
him
the
old
patriarch
holding
a
lamp
over
his
head
finally
appeared
and
peered
outward
into
the
darkness
yes
he
exclaimed
as
he
always
did
eyeing
the
victim
what
is
it
you
want
of
me
white
said
the
treasurer
it
me
i
got
young
squiers
here
who
needs
your
sympathy
and
aid
tonight
he
been
beaten
and
robbed
out
here
on
the
road
while
he
was
on
his
way
to
his
mother
home
who
inquired
the
patriarch
stepping
out
on
the
porch
and
eyeing
the
newcomer
the
while
he
held
the
lamp
down
so
as
to
get
a
good
look
billy
squiers
he
exclaimed
when
he
saw
who
it
was
morton
not
take
this
man
into
my
house
i
know
him
he
a
drunkard
and
a
liar
no
man
has
robbed
him
this
is
all
a
pretense
and
i
want
you
to
take
him
away
from
here
put
him
in
the
hotel
i
pay
his
expenses
for
the
night
but
he
ca
come
into
my
home
and
he
retired
closing
the
door
after
him
the
treasurer
fell
back
amazed
at
this
onslaught
but
recovered
sufficiently
to
knock
at
the
door
once
more
and
declare
to
his
friend
that
he
deemed
him
no
christian
in
taking
such
a
stand
and
that
true
religion
commanded
otherwise
even
though
he
suspected
the
worst
the
man
was
injured
and
penniless
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
quote
the
parable
of
the
good
samaritan
who
passed
down
by
way
of
jericho
and
rescued
him
who
had
fallen
among
thieves
the
argument
had
long
continued
into
the
night
and
rain
before
the
old
patriarch
finally
waved
them
both
away
do
you
quote
scripture
to
me
he
finally
shouted
defiantly
still
holding
the
light
and
flourishing
it
in
an
oratorical
sweep
i
know
my
bible
there
nothing
in
it
requiring
me
to
shield
liars
and
drunkards
not
a
bit
of
it
and
once
more
he
went
in
and
closed
the
door
nevertheless
the
youth
was
housed
and
fed
at
his
expense
and
no
charge
of
any
kind
made
against
him
although
many
believed
as
did
white
that
he
was
guilty
of
theft
whereas
others
of
the
opposing
political
camp
believed
not
however
considerable
opposition
based
on
old
white
lack
of
humanity
in
this
instance
was
generated
by
this
argument
and
for
years
he
was
taunted
with
it
although
he
always
maintained
that
he
was
justified
and
that
the
lord
did
not
require
any
such
service
of
him
the
crowning
quality
of
nearly
all
of
his
mercies
as
one
may
easily
see
was
their
humor
even
he
was
not
unaware
in
retrospect
of
the
figure
he
made
at
times
and
would
smilingly
tell
under
provocation
of
his
peculiar
attitude
on
one
occasion
or
another
partially
from
himself
from
those
who
saw
it
and
the
judge
presiding
in
the
case
was
the
following
characteristic
anecdote
gathered
in
the
same
community
with
him
at
one
time
lived
a
certain
man
by
the
name
of
moore
who
in
his
day
had
been
an
expert
tobacco
picker
but
who
later
had
come
by
an
injury
to
his
hand
and
so
turned
cobbler
and
a
rather
helpless
although
not
hopeless
one
at
that
white
had
known
this
man
from
boyhood
up
and
had
been
a
witness
at
various
times
to
the
many
changes
in
his
fortunes
from
the
time
for
instance
when
he
had
earned
as
much
as
several
dollars
a
day
good
pay
in
that
region
to
the
hour
when
he
took
a
cobbler
kit
upon
his
back
and
began
to
eke
out
a
bare
livelihood
for
his
old
age
by
traveling
about
the
countryside
mending
shoes
at
the
time
under
consideration
this
picker
had
degenerated
into
so
humble
a
thing
as
uncle
bobby
moore
a
poor
cobbler
whose
earlier
state
but
few
knew
and
who
at
this
time
had
only
a
few
charitably
inclined
friends
with
some
of
whom
he
spent
the
more
pleasant
portion
of
the
year
from
spring
to
fall
thus
it
was
his
custom
to
begin
his
annual
pilgrimage
with
a
visit
of
ten
days
to
white
where
he
would
sit
and
cobble
shoes
for
all
the
members
of
the
household
from
here
he
would
go
to
another
acquaintance
some
ten
miles
farther
on
where
he
could
enjoy
the
early
fruit
which
was
then
ripening
in
delicious
quantity
then
he
would
visit
a
friendly
farmer
whose
home
was
upon
the
missouri
river
still
farther
away
where
he
did
his
annual
fishing
and
so
on
by
slow
degrees
until
at
last
he
would
reach
a
neighborhood
rich
in
cider
presses
where
he
would
wind
up
the
fall
and
so
end
his
travel
for
the
winter
beginning
his
peculiar
round
once
more
the
following
spring
at
the
home
of
white
naturally
the
old
patriarch
knew
him
and
liked
him
passing
well
as
he
grew
older
however
uncle
bobby
reached
the
place
where
even
by
this
method
and
his
best
efforts
he
could
scarcely
make
enough
to
sustain
him
in
comfort
during
the
winter
season
which
was
one
of
nearly
six
months
free
as
his
food
and
lodging
occasionally
were
he
was
too
feeble
not
desiring
to
put
himself
upon
any
friend
for
more
than
a
short
visit
he
finally
applied
to
the
patriarch
i
come
to
you
white
he
said
because
i
do
think
i
can
do
for
myself
any
longer
in
the
winter
season
my
hand
hurts
a
good
deal
and
i
get
tired
so
easily
i
want
to
know
if
you
wo
help
me
to
get
into
the
county
farm
during
the
winter
months
anyhow
in
summer
i
can
still
look
out
for
myself
i
think
in
short
he
made
it
clear
that
in
summer
he
preferred
to
be
out
so
that
he
might
visit
his
friends
and
still
enjoy
his
declining
years
the
old
patriarch
was
visibly
moved
by
this
appeal
and
seizing
him
by
the
arm
and
leading
off
toward
the
courthouse
where
the
judge
governing
such
cases
was
then
sitting
he
exclaimed
come
right
down
here
uncle
bobby
i
see
what
can
be
done
about
this
your
old
age
should
be
troubled
in
this
fashion
not
after
all
the
efforts
you
have
made
to
maintain
yourself
and
bursting
in
on
the
court
a
few
moments
later
where
a
trial
was
holding
at
the
time
he
deliberately
led
his
charge
down
the
aisle
disturbing
the
court
proceedings
by
so
doing
and
calling
as
he
came
your
honor
i
want
you
to
hear
this
case
especially
it
a
very
important
and
a
very
sad
case
indeed
agape
the
spectators
paused
to
listen
the
judge
an
old
and
appreciative
friend
of
his
turned
a
solemn
eye
upon
this
latest
evidence
of
eccentricity
what
is
it
mr
white
he
inquired
your
honor
returned
the
latter
in
his
most
earnest
and
oratorical
manner
this
man
here
as
you
may
or
may
not
know
is
an
old
and
honorable
citizen
of
this
county
he
has
been
here
nearly
all
the
days
of
his
life
and
every
day
of
that
time
he
has
earned
an
honest
living
these
people
here
he
said
gazing
about
upon
the
interested
spectators
can
witness
whether
or
not
he
was
one
of
the
best
tobacco
pickers
this
county
ever
saw
mayhew
he
interrupted
himself
to
call
to
a
spectator
on
one
of
the
benches
you
know
whether
uncle
bobby
always
earned
an
honest
living
speak
up
tell
the
court
did
he
yes
white
said
mayhew
quickly
he
did
morrison
he
called
turning
in
another
direction
where
an
aged
farmer
sat
what
do
you
know
of
this
man
morrison
was
about
to
reply
when
the
court
interfered
the
court
knows
white
that
he
is
an
honest
man
now
what
would
you
have
it
do
well
your
honor
resumed
the
speaker
indifferently
following
his
own
oratorical
bent
the
while
the
company
surveyed
him
amused
and
smiling
this
man
has
always
earned
an
honest
living
until
he
injured
his
hand
here
in
some
way
a
number
of
years
ago
and
since
then
it
has
been
difficult
for
him
to
make
his
way
and
he
has
been
cobbling
for
a
living
however
he
is
getting
so
old
now
that
he
ca
even
earn
much
at
that
except
in
the
spring
and
summer
and
so
i
brought
him
here
to
have
him
assigned
a
place
in
the
county
infirmary
i
want
you
to
make
out
an
order
admitting
him
to
that
institution
so
that
i
can
take
it
and
go
with
him
and
see
that
he
is
comfortably
placed
all
right
white
replied
the
judge
surveying
the
two
figures
in
i
so
order
but
your
honor
he
went
on
there
an
exception
i
want
made
in
this
case
moore
has
a
few
friends
that
he
likes
to
visit
in
the
summer
and
who
like
to
have
him
visit
them
i
want
him
to
have
the
privilege
of
coming
out
in
the
summer
to
see
these
people
and
to
see
me
all
right
white
said
the
judge
he
shall
have
that
privilege
now
what
else
satisfied
in
these
particulars
the
aged
citizen
led
his
charge
away
and
then
went
with
him
to
the
infirmary
where
he
presented
the
order
of
the
court
and
then
left
him
things
went
very
well
with
his
humble
client
for
a
certain
time
and
uncle
bobby
was
thought
to
be
well
disposed
of
when
one
day
he
came
to
his
friend
again
it
appeared
that
only
recently
he
had
been
changed
about
in
his
quarters
at
the
infirmary
and
put
into
a
room
with
a
slightly
demented
individual
whose
nocturnal
wanderings
greatly
disturbed
his
very
necessary
sleep
i
want
to
know
if
you
wo
have
them
put
me
by
myself
white
he
concluded
i
need
my
sleep
but
they
say
they
ca
do
it
without
an
order
once
more
the
old
patriarch
led
his
charge
before
the
court
then
sitting
as
it
happened
and
breaking
in
upon
the
general
proceedings
as
before
began
your
honor
this
man
here
moore
whom
i
brought
before
you
some
time
ago
has
been
comfortably
housed
by
your
order
and
he
deeply
grateful
for
it
as
he
will
tell
you
and
as
i
can
but
he
an
old
man
your
honor
and
above
all
things
needs
his
rest
now
of
late
been
quartering
him
with
a
poor
demented
sufferer
down
there
who
walks
a
good
deal
in
his
sleep
and
it
wears
upon
him
i
come
here
with
him
to
ask
you
to
allow
him
to
have
a
room
by
himself
where
he
will
be
alone
and
rest
undisturbed
very
well
white
said
the
court
it
shall
be
as
you
request
without
replying
the
old
gentleman
turned
and
led
the
supplicant
away
everything
went
peacefully
now
for
a
number
of
years
until
finally
uncle
bobby
having
grown
so
feeble
with
age
that
he
feared
he
was
soon
to
die
came
to
his
friend
and
asked
him
to
promise
him
one
thing
what
is
it
asked
the
latter
by
way
of
replying
the
supplicant
described
an
old
oak
tree
which
grew
in
the
yard
of
the
baptist
church
some
miles
from
danville
and
said
i
want
you
to
promise
that
when
i
am
dead
wherever
i
happen
to
be
at
the
time
that
you
will
see
that
i
am
buried
under
that
tree
he
gave
no
particular
reason
save
that
he
had
always
liked
the
tree
and
the
view
it
commanded
but
made
his
request
a
very
secret
matter
and
begged
to
be
assured
that
white
would
come
and
get
his
body
and
carry
it
to
the
old
oak
the
latter
always
a
respecter
of
the
peculiarities
and
crotchets
of
his
friends
promised
after
a
few
years
went
by
suddenly
one
day
he
learned
that
uncle
bobby
was
not
only
dead
but
buried
a
thing
which
astonished
him
greatly
no
one
locally
being
supposed
to
know
that
he
was
to
have
had
any
special
form
of
burial
the
old
patriarch
at
once
recalled
his
promise
where
is
his
body
he
asked
why
they
buried
it
under
the
old
white
oak
over
at
mt
horeb
church
was
the
answer
what
he
exclaimed
too
astonished
to
think
of
anything
save
his
lost
privilege
of
mercy
who
told
them
to
bury
him
there
why
did
said
the
friend
it
was
his
last
wish
i
believe
the
confounded
villain
he
shouted
amusingly
enough
he
led
me
to
believe
that
i
was
the
only
one
he
told
i
alone
was
to
have
looked
after
his
burial
and
now
look
at
him
going
and
having
himself
buried
without
a
word
the
scoundrel
would
you
believe
that
an
old
friend
like
uncle
bobby
would
do
anything
like
that
however
he
added
after
a
time
i
think
i
know
how
it
was
he
got
so
old
and
feeble
here
of
late
that
he
must
have
lost
his
mind
otherwise
he
would
never
have
done
anything
like
that
to
me
and
with
this
he
was
satisfied
to
rest
and
let
bygones
be
bygones
maupassant
he
dawned
on
me
in
the
spring
of
a
stocky
sturdy
penetrative
temperament
of
not
more
than
or
years
of
age
steady
of
eye
rather
aloof
and
yet
pervasive
and
bristling
a
devouring
type
without
saying
much
and
seeming
to
take
anything
i
had
to
say
with
a
grain
of
salt
he
managed
to
impress
himself
on
me
at
once
frankly
i
liked
him
very
much
although
i
could
see
at
a
glance
that
he
was
not
so
very
much
impressed
with
me
i
was
an
older
man
than
he
by
say
ten
years
an
editor
of
an
unimportant
magazine
newly
brought
in
which
he
did
not
know
to
turn
it
into
something
better
in
order
to
earn
a
few
dollars
he
had
undertaken
to
prepare
for
the
previous
editor
a
most
ridiculous
article
some
silly
thing
about
newspaper
writing
as
a
career
for
women
it
had
been
ordered
or
encouraged
and
i
felt
that
it
was
but
just
that
it
should
be
paid
for
why
do
you
waste
your
time
on
a
thing
like
that
i
inquired
smiling
and
trying
to
criticize
and
yet
encourage
him
at
one
and
the
same
time
for
i
had
been
annoyed
by
many
similar
assignments
given
out
by
the
old
management
which
could
not
now
be
used
you
look
to
me
to
have
too
much
force
and
sense
for
that
why
not
undertake
something
worth
your
time
my
time
hell
he
bristled
like
a
fighting
of
which
by
the
way
he
reminded
me
you
show
me
a
magazine
in
this
town
that
would
buy
anything
that
i
thought
worthy
of
my
time
you
like
all
the
rest
of
them
you
talk
big
but
you
really
do
want
anything
very
important
you
want
little
things
probably
written
to
a
theory
or
down
to
policy
i
know
give
me
the
stuff
you
do
have
to
take
it
it
was
ordered
but
i
throw
it
in
the
waste
basket
not
so
fast
not
so
fast
i
replied
admiring
his
courage
and
moved
by
his
contempt
of
the
editorial
and
book
publishing
conditions
in
america
he
was
so
young
and
raw
and
savage
in
his
way
quite
animal
and
yet
how
interesting
there
was
something
as
fresh
and
clean
about
him
as
a
newly
plowed
field
or
the
virgin
prairies
he
typified
for
me
all
the
young
unsophisticated
strength
of
my
country
but
with
more
punch
than
it
usually
manifests
in
matters
intellectual
at
least
now
do
get
excited
and
do
snarl
i
cooed
i
know
what
you
say
is
true
they
do
really
want
much
of
what
you
have
to
offer
i
do
working
for
some
one
else
as
most
of
us
do
for
the
dear
circulation
department
it
not
possible
for
us
to
get
very
far
above
crowd
needs
and
tastes
i
been
in
your
position
exactly
i
am
now
where
do
you
come
from
he
told
me
missouri
and
some
very
few
years
before
from
its
state
university
and
what
is
it
you
want
to
do
what
that
to
you
he
replied
irritatingly
with
an
ingrowing
and
obvious
of
superiority
and
withdrawing
as
though
he
highly
resented
my
question
as
condescending
and
intrusive
you
probably
would
understand
if
i
told
you
just
now
i
want
to
write
enough
magazine
stuff
to
make
a
living
that
all
dear
dear
i
said
laughing
at
the
slap
what
a
bravo
we
are
really
you
interesting
but
suppose
now
you
and
i
get
down
to
brass
tacks
you
want
to
do
something
interesting
if
you
can
and
get
paid
for
it
i
rather
like
you
and
anyhow
you
look
to
me
as
though
you
might
do
the
things
i
want
or
some
of
them
now
you
want
to
do
the
least
silly
thing
you
can
something
better
than
this
i
want
the
least
silly
stuff
i
can
get
away
with
in
this
magazine
genuine
color
out
of
the
life
of
new
york
if
such
a
thing
can
be
published
in
an
ordinary
magazine
roughly
here
the
kind
of
thing
i
want
and
i
outlined
to
him
the
probable
policy
of
the
magazine
under
my
direction
i
had
taken
an
anæmic
monthly
known
as
and
was
attempting
to
recast
it
into
a
national
or
international
metropolitan
picture
he
thawed
slightly
well
maybe
with
that
sort
of
idea
behind
it
it
might
come
to
something
i
do
know
it
that
you
may
be
the
one
to
do
it
he
emphasized
the
possible
at
any
rate
it
worth
trying
judging
by
the
snide
editors
and
publications
in
this
town
no
one
in
america
wants
anything
decent
his
lip
curled
i
have
ambitions
of
my
own
but
i
do
expect
to
work
them
out
through
the
magazines
of
this
town
maybe
not
of
this
country
i
did
know
that
any
change
was
under
way
here
well
it
is
i
said
still
you
ca
expect
much
from
this
either
remember
after
all
it
seeks
to
be
a
popular
magazine
we
see
how
far
we
can
go
with
really
interesting
material
and
now
if
you
know
of
any
others
like
yourself
bring
them
in
here
i
need
them
i
pay
you
for
that
article
only
i
include
it
in
a
better
price
i
give
you
for
something
else
later
see
i
smiled
and
he
smiled
his
was
a
warmth
which
was
infectious
when
he
chose
to
yield
but
it
was
always
a
repressed
warmth
cynical
a
bit
hard
heat
chained
to
a
purpose
i
thought
he
went
away
and
i
saw
him
no
more
until
about
a
week
later
when
he
brought
me
his
first
attempt
to
give
me
what
i
wanted
in
the
meantime
i
was
busy
organizing
a
staff
which
should
if
possible
i
decided
after
seeing
him
include
him
i
could
probably
use
him
as
a
salaried
special
writer
provided
he
could
be
trained
to
write
specials
he
looked
so
intelligent
and
ambitious
that
he
promised
much
besides
the
little
article
which
he
had
left
when
he
came
again
while
not
well
organized
or
arranged
as
to
its
ideas
or
best
points
was
exceedingly
well
written
from
the
point
of
mere
expression
and
the
next
thing
i
had
given
him
to
attempt
was
even
better
it
was
if
i
recall
correctly
a
stirring
picture
of
the
east
side
intended
to
appeal
to
readers
elsewhere
than
in
the
city
but
while
in
the
matter
of
color
and
definiteness
of
expression
as
well
as
choice
of
words
it
was
exceptional
it
was
lacking
in
quite
as
the
first
one
had
been
the
arrangement
of
its
best
points
this
i
explained
to
him
and
also
made
it
clear
to
him
that
i
could
show
him
how
if
he
would
let
me
he
seemed
willing
enough
quite
anxious
although
always
with
an
air
of
reserve
as
if
he
were
accommodating
himself
to
me
in
this
much
but
no
more
he
grasped
the
idea
of
order
swiftly
and
in
a
little
while
having
worked
at
a
table
in
an
outer
room
brought
me
the
rearranged
material
almost
if
not
quite
satisfactory
during
a
number
of
weeks
and
months
thereafter
working
on
one
special
and
another
in
this
way
with
me
he
seemed
finally
to
grasp
the
theory
i
had
or
at
least
to
develop
a
method
of
his
own
which
was
quite
as
satisfactory
to
me
and
i
was
very
much
pleased
a
little
later
i
employed
him
at
a
regular
salary
it
was
pathetic
as
i
look
at
it
now
the
things
we
were
trying
to
do
and
the
conditions
under
which
we
were
trying
to
do
them
the
raw
commercial
force
and
theory
which
underlay
the
whole
thing
the
necessity
of
explaining
and
fighting
for
so
much
that
one
should
not
as
i
saw
it
then
have
to
argue
over
at
all
we
were
in
new
rooms
in
a
new
building
filled
with
lumber
not
yet
placed
and
awaiting
the
completion
of
partitions
which
as
some
one
remarked
would
divide
us
up
our
publisher
and
owner
was
a
small
energetic
vibrant
and
colorful
soul
all
egotism
and
conviction
as
to
the
need
of
push
ambition
closeness
to
life
punch
and
what
not
else
american
to
the
core
and
descending
on
us
or
me
rather
hourly
as
it
were
demanding
the
hows
and
the
whyfors
of
the
dream
which
the
little
group
i
was
swiftly
gathering
about
me
was
seeking
to
make
real
it
was
essential
to
me
therefore
that
something
different
should
be
done
some
new
fresh
note
concerning
metropolitan
life
and
action
be
struck
the
old
slow
and
somewhat
grandiose
methods
of
reporting
and
describing
things
dispensed
with
at
least
in
this
instance
and
here
was
a
youth
who
seemed
able
to
help
me
do
it
he
was
so
vigorous
so
avid
of
life
so
anxious
to
picture
the
very
atmosphere
which
this
magazine
was
now
seeking
to
portray
i
felt
stronger
better
for
having
him
around
the
growth
of
the
city
the
character
and
atmosphere
of
a
given
neighborhood
the
facts
concerning
some
great
social
fortune
event
condition
crime
interested
him
intensely
on
the
other
hand
he
was
so
very
easy
to
teach
quick
to
sense
what
was
wanted
and
the
order
in
which
it
must
be
presented
a
few
brief
technical
explanations
from
me
and
he
had
the
art
of
writing
a
special
at
his
fingertips
and
thereafter
gave
me
no
real
difficulty
but
what
was
more
interesting
to
me
than
his
success
in
grasping
my
theory
of
special
writing
was
his
own
character
as
it
was
revealed
to
me
from
day
to
day
in
intimate
working
contact
with
him
under
these
conditions
here
as
i
soon
learned
and
was
glad
to
learn
was
no
scribbler
of
the
old
school
of
literary
composition
on
the
contrary
he
sounded
for
the
first
time
in
my
dealings
with
literary
aspirants
of
every
kind
that
sure
sane
penetrating
note
so
common
to
the
best
writers
of
the
continent
a
note
entirely
free
from
mush
bravado
and
cant
he
had
a
style
as
clear
as
water
as
simple
as
rain
color
romance
humor
and
if
a
little
too
much
of
vanity
and
still
one
could
forgive
him
for
they
were
rather
already
used
to
dealing
with
literary
and
artistic
aspirants
of
different
kinds
in
connection
with
the
publications
of
which
i
had
been
a
part
this
one
appealed
to
me
as
being
the
best
of
them
all
and
a
very
refreshing
change
one
day
only
a
few
weeks
after
i
had
met
him
seeing
that
i
was
alert
for
fiction
poetry
and
short
essays
or
prose
phantasies
all
illustrative
of
the
spirit
of
new
york
he
brought
me
a
little
poem
entitled
neuvain
which
interested
me
greatly
it
was
so
brief
and
forceful
and
yet
so
delicate
a
double
triolet
of
the
old
french
order
but
with
the
modernity
and
flavor
of
the
streets
outside
the
conduit
cars
and
dancing
children
of
the
pavements
the
title
seemed
affected
seeing
that
the
english
word
spring
would
have
done
as
well
but
it
was
typical
of
his
mood
at
the
time
his
literary
adorations
he
was
in
leash
to
the
french
school
of
which
de
maupassant
was
the
outstanding
luminary
only
i
did
not
know
it
at
the
time
charming
i
exclaimed
quite
enthusiastically
i
like
this
let
me
see
anything
else
you
have
do
you
write
short
stories
for
answer
he
merely
stared
at
me
for
a
little
while
in
the
most
examining
and
arrogant
and
contemptuous
way
as
much
as
to
say
let
me
see
if
you
are
really
worth
my
time
and
trouble
in
this
matter
or
this
sad
specimen
of
alleged
mentality
is
just
beginning
to
suspect
that
i
might
write
a
short
story
seeing
that
i
merely
smiled
most
genially
in
return
he
finally
deigned
to
say
sure
i
write
short
stories
what
do
you
think
i
in
the
writing
game
for
but
you
might
be
interested
in
novels
only
or
plays
or
poetry
no
he
returned
after
a
pause
and
with
that
same
air
of
unrelieved
condescension
the
short
story
is
what
i
want
to
specialize
in
well
i
said
to
myself
here
is
a
young
cub
who
certainly
has
talent
is
crowded
with
it
and
yet
owing
to
the
kind
of
thing
he
is
starting
out
to
do
and
the
fact
that
life
will
give
him
slaps
and
to
spare
before
he
is
many
years
older
he
needs
to
be
encouraged
i
was
like
that
myself
not
so
long
ago
and
besides
if
i
do
not
encourage
this
type
of
work
financially
which
is
the
best
way
of
all
who
will
about
a
week
later
i
was
given
another
and
still
more
gratifying
surprise
for
one
day
in
his
usual
condescending
manner
he
brought
to
me
two
short
pieces
of
fiction
and
laid
them
most
gingerly
on
my
desk
with
scarcely
a
word
here
was
something
i
might
read
if
i
chose
i
believe
the
reading
of
these
two
stories
gave
me
as
much
of
a
start
as
though
i
had
discovered
a
fully
developed
genius
they
were
so
truly
new
or
different
in
their
point
of
view
so
very
clear
incisive
brief
with
so
much
point
in
them
second
right
for
by
then
having
been
struggling
with
the
problem
in
other
magazine
offices
before
this
i
had
become
not
a
little
pessimistic
as
to
the
trend
of
american
short
fiction
as
well
as
long
the
impossibility
of
finding
any
even
supposing
it
publishable
once
we
had
it
my
own
experience
with
sister
carrie
as
well
as
the
fierce
opposition
or
chilling
indifference
which
as
i
saw
overtook
all
those
who
attempted
anything
even
partially
serious
in
america
was
enough
to
make
me
believe
that
the
world
took
anything
even
slightly
approximating
the
truth
as
one
of
the
rankest
and
most
criminal
offenses
possible
one
dared
not
talk
out
loud
one
dared
not
report
life
as
it
was
as
one
lived
it
and
one
of
the
primary
warnings
i
had
received
from
the
president
of
this
very
organization
a
most
eager
and
ambitious
and
distressing
example
of
that
american
which
combines
a
acquisitiveness
with
an
inward
and
absolute
conviction
of
righteousness
was
that
while
he
wanted
something
new
in
fiction
something
more
virile
and
than
that
mush
as
he
characterized
it
to
be
found
in
the
current
magazines
still
it
must
have
a
strong
appeal
for
the
general
reader
and
be
very
compelling
in
fact
and
as
the
dear
general
reader
would
of
course
understand
that
word
a
solid
little
pair
of
millstones
which
would
unquestionably
end
in
macerating
everything
vital
out
of
any
good
story
still
i
did
not
despair
something
might
be
done
and
though
i
sighed
i
hoped
to
be
able
to
make
my
superior
stretch
a
point
in
favor
of
the
exceptional
thing
or
as
the
slang
phrase
went
slip
a
few
over
on
him
but
that
of
course
meant
nothing
or
something
as
you
choose
my
dream
was
really
to
find
one
or
many
like
this
youth
or
a
pungent
kind
of
realism
that
would
be
true
and
yet
within
such
limits
as
would
make
it
usable
imagine
then
my
satisfaction
in
finding
these
two
things
tales
that
i
could
not
only
admire
genuinely
but
that
i
could
publish
things
that
ought
to
have
an
interest
for
all
who
knew
even
a
little
about
life
true
they
were
ironic
cruel
but
still
with
humor
and
color
so
deftly
and
cleanly
told
that
they
were
i
called
him
and
said
as
much
or
nearly
so
a
mistake
as
i
sometimes
think
now
for
art
should
be
long
and
bought
them
forthwith
hoping
almost
against
hope
to
find
many
more
such
like
them
by
this
time
by
the
way
and
as
i
should
have
said
before
i
had
still
further
enlarged
my
staff
by
one
art
director
of
the
most
flamboyant
and
erratic
character
a
genius
of
sorts
volatile
restless
emotional
colorful
a
veritable
soul
who
not
content
to
arrange
and
decorate
the
magazine
each
month
must
needs
wish
to
write
paint
compose
verse
and
music
and
stage
plays
as
well
as
move
in
an
upper
social
world
to
which
was
his
by
birth
again
there
was
by
now
an
makeup
editor
a
graduate
of
some
distinguished
sectarian
school
who
was
more
interested
in
jerome
and
his
as
an
embodiment
of
classic
latin
than
he
was
in
getting
out
the
magazine
still
he
had
the
advantage
of
being
interesting
and
i
learned
about
horace
from
him
again
there
was
a
most
interesting
and
youthful
and
pretty
if
severe
example
of
the
mawr
school
of
literary
art
and
criticism
a
most
engagingly
interesting
intellectual
maiden
who
functioned
as
assistant
editor
and
reader
in
an
adjoining
room
along
with
the
the
makeup
editor
and
an
office
boy
this
very
valuable
and
in
some
respects
remarkable
young
woman
who
while
holding
me
in
proper
contempt
i
fear
for
my
rather
loose
and
unliterary
ways
was
still
as
i
had
suspected
before
employing
her
as
keen
for
something
new
and
vital
in
fiction
and
every
other
phase
of
the
scriptic
art
as
any
one
well
could
be
she
was
ever
for
culling
sorting
eliminating
repression
carried
to
the
power
at
first
l
cordially
hated
her
calling
her
a
simp
a
bluff
a
and
what
not
in
addition
to
these
there
was
a
constantly
swelling
band
of
writers
artists
poets
critics
dreamers
of
reforms
social
and
i
know
not
what
else
who
holding
the
hope
of
achieving
their
ends
or
aims
through
some
really
forceful
magazine
were
by
now
beginning
to
make
our
place
a
center
it
fairly
swarmed
for
a
time
with
aspirants
an
amusing
vivid
strident
world
as
for
l
all
this
being
new
to
him
he
was
as
interested
fascinated
even
as
any
one
well
might
be
he
responded
to
it
almost
gayly
at
times
wondering
whether
something
wonderful
international
enduring
might
not
be
made
to
come
of
it
he
rapidly
developed
into
one
of
the
most
pertinacious
and
even
disconcerting
youths
i
have
ever
met
at
times
he
seemed
to
have
a
positive
genius
for
saying
and
doing
irritable
and
disagreeable
things
not
only
to
me
but
to
others
never
having
heard
of
me
before
he
met
me
here
he
was
convinced
i
think
that
i
was
a
mere
nothing
with
some
slight
possibilities
as
an
editor
maybe
certainly
with
none
as
a
writer
or
as
one
who
could
even
suggest
anything
to
writers
i
had
helped
him
but
that
was
as
it
should
be
as
for
my
he
was
at
first
a
fool
later
a
genius
ditto
my
makeup
man
as
for
miss
e
the
holyoke
assistant
who
from
the
first
had
agreed
with
me
that
here
indeed
was
a
writer
of
promise
a
genius
really
he
as
i
have
said
at
first
despised
her
later
by
dint
of
exulting
in
his
force
sincerity
of
purpose
his
keen
insight
and
all
but
braggart
strength
she
managed
probably
on
account
of
her
looks
and
physical
graces
to
install
herself
in
his
confidence
and
to
convince
him
that
she
was
not
only
an
honest
admirer
of
his
skill
but
one
who
had
taste
and
judgment
of
no
mean
caliber
thereafter
he
was
about
as
agreeable
as
a
wild
animal
would
be
about
any
office
but
above
all
he
was
affronted
by
m
the
publisher
of
the
paper
concerning
whom
he
could
find
no
words
equal
to
his
contemptuous
thoughts
of
him
the
publisher
as
l
made
quite
bold
to
say
to
me
was
little
more
than
a
dodging
financial
ferret
a
financial
for
some
trust
or
other
a
shrewd
material
little
shopkeeper
this
because
m
was
accustomed
to
enter
and
force
a
conversation
here
and
there
anxious
of
course
to
gather
the
full
import
of
all
these
various
energies
and
enthusiasms
one
of
the
things
which
l
most
resented
in
him
at
the
time
was
his
air
of
supreme
material
his
obvious
attempt
and
wish
not
to
convey
it
his
clothes
his
car
his
numerous
assistants
and
secretaries
following
him
here
and
there
from
various
other
organizations
with
which
he
was
connected
m
idea
as
he
always
said
was
to
spend
and
to
live
only
it
was
he
merely
induced
others
so
to
do
one
of
his
customs
and
it
must
have
impressed
l
very
much
innocent
newcomer
that
he
was
was
to
have
one
or
another
of
his
hirelings
announce
his
passing
from
one
important
meeting
to
another
within
or
without
his
own
building
telephone
messages
being
thrown
in
on
his
line
or
barred
out
wherever
he
happened
to
be
at
the
moment
and
when
presumably
he
was
deep
in
one
of
those
literary
conferences
or
confidences
with
one
employee
or
another
or
with
a
group
for
which
he
rapidly
developed
a
passion
another
of
his
vanities
was
to
have
his
automobile
announced
and
he
be
almost
forced
into
it
by
impetuous
secretaries
who
because
of
orders
previously
given
insisted
that
he
must
be
made
to
keep
certain
important
engagements
or
he
would
send
for
one
of
his
hirelings
wherever
he
chanced
to
be
club
restaurant
his
home
midnight
if
necessary
to
confer
with
him
on
some
subject
of
great
moment
and
the
hireling
was
supposed
to
call
a
taxi
and
come
post
haste
in
order
that
he
might
not
be
kept
waiting
god
l
once
remarked
in
my
presence
to
think
that
a
thinking
being
has
to
be
beholden
to
a
thing
like
that
for
his
weekly
income
somebody
ought
to
tap
him
with
a
and
kill
him
but
the
manner
in
which
l
developed
in
this
atmosphere
it
was
interesting
at
first
before
the
magazine
became
so
significant
or
it
was
a
great
pleasure
for
me
to
associate
with
him
outside
office
hours
and
a
curious
and
vivid
companion
he
made
he
was
so
intensely
avid
of
life
so
intolerant
of
the
old
of
anything
different
to
that
which
he
personally
desired
or
saw
that
at
times
it
was
most
difficult
to
say
anything
at
all
for
fear
of
meeting
a
rebuff
or
at
least
a
caustic
objection
as
i
was
very
pleased
to
note
he
had
a
passion
for
seeing
as
all
youth
should
have
when
it
first
comes
to
the
great
city
the
great
bridges
the
new
tunnels
just
then
being
completed
or
dug
the
harbor
and
bay
coney
island
the
two
new
and
great
railway
terminals
then
under
construction
most
though
he
reveled
in
different
and
even
depressing
neighborhoods
eighth
avenue
for
instance
about
which
he
later
wrote
a
story
and
a
very
good
one
a
quiet
duet
hell
kitchen
that
neighborhood
that
lies
or
did
on
the
west
side
of
manhattan
between
eighth
and
tenth
avenues
and
streets
little
italy
the
region
below
delancey
and
north
of
worth
street
on
the
east
side
chinatown
washington
street
syria
in
america
the
greeks
in
and
streets
west
side
all
these
and
many
more
phases
of
new
multiplex
life
took
his
full
and
restless
attention
once
he
said
to
me
quite
excitedly
walking
up
eighth
avenue
at
two
in
the
morning
i
was
showing
him
some
rear
tenement
slums
in
the
summertime
god
how
i
hate
to
go
to
bed
in
this
town
i
afraid
something
will
happen
while
asleep
and
i
wo
see
it
that
was
exactly
how
he
felt
all
the
time
i
am
sure
and
in
those
days
he
was
most
simple
a
very
spartan
of
a
boy
he
the
least
taste
for
drink
lived
in
a
small
somewhere
eighth
avenue
i
believe
and
took
his
meals
in
those
shabby
little
rooms
where
the
characters
were
more
important
to
him
than
the
food
my
hat
my
hat
is
in
my
hand
intellectually
he
was
so
stern
and
ambitious
that
i
all
but
stood
in
awe
of
and
reverence
before
him
here
i
said
to
myself
is
one
who
will
really
do
let
him
be
as
savage
as
he
pleases
in
america
he
probably
needs
to
be
and
during
this
short
time
what
scraps
of
his
early
life
he
revealed
by
degrees
i
picked
up
bits
of
his
early
deprivations
and
difficulties
if
such
they
might
be
called
he
had
been
a
newspaper
reporter
or
had
tried
to
be
in
kansas
city
had
worked
in
the
college
restaurant
and
laundry
of
the
state
university
from
which
he
had
graduated
to
help
pay
his
way
afterward
he
had
assisted
the
janitor
of
some
great
skyscraper
somewhere
kansas
city
i
believe
and
what
was
most
pleasing
to
me
he
in
nowise
emphasized
these
as
youthful
difficulties
or
made
any
comment
as
to
their
being
hard
neither
did
he
try
to
boastingly
minimize
them
as
nothing
at
all
another
wretched
pose
from
him
i
learned
that
throughout
his
youth
he
had
been
carried
here
and
there
by
the
iron
woman
who
was
his
mother
and
whom
he
seemed
to
adore
in
some
grim
contentious
way
smothering
his
comments
as
though
he
disliked
to
say
anything
at
all
and
yet
describing
her
at
times
as
coarse
and
vulgar
but
a
mother
to
him
all
right
someone
who
had
made
marked
sacrifices
for
him
she
had
once
run
a
restaurant
in
a
western
mining
camp
had
then
or
later
carried
him
as
a
puling
baby
under
her
shawl
or
cloak
across
the
mojave
desert
on
foot
a
part
of
the
way
apparently
he
did
not
know
who
his
father
was
and
he
was
not
very
much
concerned
to
know
whether
she
did
or
not
his
father
had
died
he
said
when
he
was
a
baby
later
his
mother
then
a
cook
in
some
railroad
hotel
in
texas
had
sent
him
to
school
there
later
still
she
had
been
a
bawler
out
if
you
know
what
that
means
an
employee
of
a
loan
shark
and
used
by
him
to
compel
delinquent
albeit
petty
and
pathetic
creditors
to
pay
their
dues
or
then
and
there
before
all
their
be
screamed
at
for
their
delinquency
about
the
shop
in
which
they
worked
later
she
became
a
private
detective
an
insurance
agent
god
knows
what
a
kind
of
rough
as
she
turned
out
to
be
but
all
the
while
clinging
to
this
boy
her
pet
no
doubt
her
dream
of
perfection
she
had
by
turns
sent
him
to
common
and
high
school
and
to
college
remitting
him
such
sums
of
money
as
she
might
to
pay
his
way
later
still
at
that
very
time
in
fact
she
was
seeking
to
come
to
new
york
to
keep
house
for
him
only
he
would
not
have
that
perhaps
sensing
the
need
of
greater
freedom
but
he
wrote
her
regularly
as
he
confessed
to
me
and
in
later
years
i
believe
sent
her
a
part
of
his
earnings
which
were
to
be
saved
by
her
for
him
against
a
rainy
day
among
his
posthumous
writings
later
i
found
a
very
lovely
story
his
mother
describing
her
and
himself
in
unsparing
and
yet
loving
terms
a
compound
of
the
tender
and
the
brutal
in
his
own
soul
the
thing
that
always
made
me
hope
for
the
best
was
that
at
that
time
he
was
not
at
all
concerned
with
the
petty
little
and
economic
definitions
and
distinctions
which
were
floating
about
his
american
world
in
one
form
and
another
indeed
he
seemed
to
be
entirely
free
of
and
even
alien
to
them
what
he
had
heard
about
the
indwelling
and
abiding
perfections
of
the
human
soul
had
gone
and
rightly
so
in
one
ear
and
out
the
other
he
respected
the
virtues
but
he
knew
of
and
reckoned
with
die
antipathetic
vices
which
gave
them
their
reason
for
being
to
him
the
thief
was
almost
as
important
as
the
saint
the
reason
for
the
saint
being
and
better
still
he
had
not
the
least
interest
in
american
politics
or
society
a
wonderful
sign
the
american
dream
of
getting
ahead
financially
and
socially
was
not
part
of
him
another
mark
royal
all
life
was
fascinating
acceptable
to
be
interpreted
if
one
had
the
skill
it
was
a
great
distinction
to
have
the
skill
worth
endless
pains
to
acquire
it
but
how
unwilling
would
the
average
american
of
his
day
have
been
stuffed
as
he
was
and
still
is
with
book
and
picture
drivel
about
artists
and
art
to
accept
l
as
anything
more
than
a
raw
callow
yokel
presuming
to
assail
the
outer
portals
of
the
temple
with
his
muddy
feet
a
romping
stamping
irritable
soul
with
more
the
air
of
a
young
railroad
brakeman
or
hand
than
an
artist
and
with
so
much
coarse
language
at
times
and
such
brutality
of
thought
as
to
bar
him
completely
one
might
say
from
having
anything
to
do
with
great
fiction
great
artistic
conceptions
or
the
temple
of
art
what
sit
with
the
mighty
that
coarse
youth
with
hair
parted
at
one
side
and
combed
over
one
ear
in
the
manner
of
a
grandiose
barber
with
those
and
none
too
shapely
brown
shoes
that
none
too
store
suit
of
clothes
that
little
round
brown
hat
more
often
a
cap
pulled
rather
savagely
and
vulgarly
even
insultingly
over
one
eye
that
coarse
frieze
overcoat
still
worn
on
cold
spring
days
its
corners
back
and
front
turned
up
by
the
damp
and
from
being
indifferently
sat
on
that
brash
pipe
and
bag
of
cheap
tobacco
extracted
and
lit
at
odd
moments
what
that
youth
with
the
aggressive
irritating
vibrant
manner
almost
the
young
tough
with
a
chip
on
his
shoulder
looking
for
one
to
even
so
much
as
indicate
that
he
is
not
all
he
should
be
positively
there
was
something
brutal
and
yet
cosmic
not
comic
about
him
his
intellectual
and
art
pretensions
considered
at
times
his
waspishness
and
bravado
palled
even
on
me
he
was
too
aggressive
too
forceful
too
intolerant
i
said
he
should
be
softer
at
other
times
i
felt
that
he
needed
to
be
all
that
and
more
to
get
by
as
he
would
have
said
i
wanted
to
modify
him
a
little
and
yet
i
did
and
i
remained
drawn
to
him
in
spite
of
many
irritating
little
circumstances
all
but
infuriating
at
times
and
actually
calculated
it
seemed
with
a
kind
of
savage
skill
to
reduce
what
he
conceived
to
be
my
lofty
superiority
at
times
i
thought
he
ought
to
be
killed
like
a
father
meditating
on
an
unruly
son
but
the
mood
soon
passed
and
his
literary
ability
made
amends
for
everything
in
so
far
as
the
magazine
was
concerned
once
it
began
to
grow
and
attract
attention
he
was
for
me
its
most
important
asset
not
that
he
did
so
much
directly
as
that
he
provided
a
definite
standard
toward
which
we
all
had
to
work
not
incuriously
he
was
swiftly
recognized
for
what
he
was
by
all
who
came
in
touch
with
the
magazine
in
the
first
place
interested
in
his
progress
i
had
seen
to
it
that
he
was
properly
introduced
wherever
that
was
possible
and
of
benefit
to
him
and
later
on
by
sheer
force
of
his
mental
capacity
and
integrity
his
dreams
and
his
critical
skill
he
managed
to
center
about
him
an
entire
band
of
seeking
young
writers
artists
poets
playwrights
aspiring
musicians
an
amusing
and
as
interesting
a
group
as
i
have
ever
seen
their
points
of
rendezvous
appeared
to
be
those
same
shabby
in
back
streets
or
even
on
the
principal
thoroughfares
about
times
square
or
they
met
in
each
other
rooms
or
my
office
at
night
after
i
had
gone
giving
me
as
an
excuse
that
they
had
work
to
do
and
during
all
this
time
the
air
fairly
hummed
with
rumors
of
new
singers
dancers
plays
stories
being
begun
or
under
way
articles
and
essays
contemplated
avid
if
none
too
well
financed
frolics
or
bohemian
midnight
suppers
here
and
there
money
was
by
no
means
plentiful
and
in
consequence
there
was
endless
borrowing
and
paying
up
among
them
among
the
most
enthusiastic
members
of
this
circle
as
i
had
begun
to
note
and
finally
rather
nervously
were
my
a
valiant
knight
in
bohemia
if
ever
there
was
one
and
she
of
bryn
standards
my
makeup
editor
as
well
as
various
contributors
who
had
since
become
more
or
less
closely
identified
with
the
magazine
were
also
following
him
up
all
the
time
if
not
directly
profitable
it
was
enlivening
and
i
was
fairly
well
convinced
by
now
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
being
aware
in
touch
with
in
sympathy
with
many
of
the
principal
tendencies
and
undercurrents
which
make
for
a
magazine
success
and
precedence
this
group
was
as
valuable
to
me
as
any
might
well
be
it
constituted
a
kitchen
cabinet
of
sorts
and
brought
hundreds
of
interesting
ideas
to
the
surface
and
from
all
directions
now
it
would
be
a
new
and
hitherto
tenor
who
was
to
be
brought
from
abroad
and
introduced
with
great
noise
to
americans
a
new
sculptor
or
painter
who
had
never
been
heard
of
in
america
a
great
actor
perhaps
or
poet
or
writer
i
listened
to
any
quantity
of
gossip
in
regard
to
new
movements
that
were
ready
to
burst
upon
the
world
in
sculpture
painting
the
scriptic
art
about
the
whole
group
there
was
much
that
was
exceedingly
warm
youthful
full
of
dreams
they
were
intensely
informative
and
full
of
hope
and
i
used
to
look
at
them
and
wonder
which
one
if
any
was
destined
to
have
his
dreams
realized
of
l
however
i
never
had
the
least
doubt
he
began
it
is
true
to
adopt
rather
more
liberal
tendencies
to
wish
always
to
be
part
and
parcel
of
this
gayety
this
rushing
here
and
there
and
he
drank
at
times
due
principally
as
i
thought
to
my
wildling
who
had
no
sense
or
reserve
in
matters
material
or
artistic
and
who
was
all
for
a
bacchanalian
career
cost
what
it
might
on
more
than
one
occasion
i
heard
l
declaring
roundly
apropos
of
some
group
scheme
of
pilgrimage
no
no
i
will
not
i
am
going
now
he
had
a
story
he
wanted
to
work
on
an
article
to
finish
at
the
same
time
he
would
often
agree
that
if
by
a
certain
time
when
he
was
through
they
were
still
at
a
certain
place
or
a
second
or
third
he
would
look
them
up
never
apparently
did
his
work
suffer
in
the
least
and
it
was
about
this
time
that
i
began
to
gather
the
true
source
and
import
of
his
literary
predisposition
he
was
literally
obsessed
as
i
now
discovered
with
continental
and
more
especially
the
french
conception
of
art
in
writing
he
had
studied
the
works
as
well
as
the
temperaments
and
experiences
more
especially
the
latter
i
fear
of
such
writers
as
de
maupassant
flaubert
baudelaire
balzac
de
musset
sand
daudet
dumas
junior
and
zola
as
well
as
a
number
of
the
more
recent
writers
hervieu
bourget
louys
and
their
contemporaries
most
of
all
though
he
was
impressed
and
deeply
by
the
life
and
art
of
de
maupassant
his
method
of
approach
his
unbiased
outlook
on
life
his
freedom
from
moral
and
religious
and
even
sentimental
predisposition
in
the
beginning
of
his
literary
career
i
really
believe
he
slaved
to
imitate
him
exactly
although
he
could
not
very
well
escape
the
american
temperament
and
rearing
by
which
he
was
hopelessly
conditioned
a
certain
western
critic
and
editor
to
whom
he
had
first
addressed
his
hopes
and
scribblings
before
coming
to
me
writing
me
after
l
death
in
reference
to
a
period
antedating
that
in
which
i
had
known
him
observed
he
was
crazy
about
the
de
stuff
that
then
held
the
boards
and
from
which
i
hope
the
recording
angel
will
put
it
to
my
credit
i
steered
him
clear
i
think
so
but
he
was
still
very
much
interested
in
it
he
admired
aubrey
beardsley
the
poster
artists
of
france
verlaine
baudelaire
rops
the
yellow
book
even
oscar
wilde
although
his
was
a
far
more
substantial
and
plebeian
and
even
radical
point
of
view
unfortunately
for
l
i
have
always
thought
there
now
thrust
himself
forward
the
publisher
and
owner
of
the
magazine
who
from
previously
having
been
content
to
see
that
the
mercantile
affairs
of
the
magazine
were
in
good
order
had
decided
that
since
it
was
attracting
attention
he
should
be
allowed
to
share
in
its
literary
and
artistic
prestige
should
indeed
be
closely
identified
with
it
and
recognized
as
its
true
source
and
inspiration
a
thing
which
in
no
fashion
had
been
contemplated
by
me
when
i
went
there
from
having
agreed
very
distinctly
with
me
that
no
such
interference
would
at
any
time
be
indulged
in
he
now
came
forward
with
a
plan
for
an
advisory
council
which
was
to
consist
of
himself
and
the
very
members
of
the
staff
which
i
had
created
i
could
not
object
and
it
did
not
disturb
me
so
much
personally
for
some
time
i
had
been
sensing
that
the
thing
was
for
me
no
end
in
itself
but
an
incident
this
same
i
felt
to
be
true
for
l
who
had
been
taking
more
and
more
interest
in
the
magazine
technical
composition
at
the
same
time
i
saw
no
immediate
way
of
arranging
my
affairs
and
departing
which
left
me
for
a
very
little
while
more
or
less
of
a
spectator
during
this
time
i
had
the
dissatisfaction
of
noting
the
growth
of
an
influence
with
l
which
could
as
i
saw
prove
only
harmful
m
was
no
suitable
guide
for
him
he
was
a
brilliant
but
superficial
and
very
material
type
who
was
convinced
that
in
the
having
and
holding
of
many
things
material
houses
lands
corporation
stocks
a
place
in
the
clubs
and
circles
of
those
who
were
materially
prosperous
was
really
to
achieve
all
that
was
significant
in
the
now
or
the
hereafter
knowing
comparatively
nothing
of
either
art
or
letters
or
that
subtle
thing
which
makes
for
personality
and
atmosphere
in
a
magazine
or
in
writing
and
especially
the
latter
that
grateful
something
which
attracts
and
detains
one
he
was
nevertheless
convinced
that
he
did
and
what
was
more
he
was
determined
not
only
to
make
friends
with
and
hold
all
those
whom
i
might
have
attracted
providing
they
could
prove
useful
to
him
but
also
a
number
of
a
much
more
successful
group
in
these
fields
those
who
had
already
achieved
repute
in
a
more
commonplace
and
popular
way
and
were
therefore
presumably
possessed
of
a
following
and
with
the
power
to
exact
a
high
return
for
their
product
and
for
the
magazine
regardless
of
intrinsic
merit
his
constant
talk
was
of
money
its
power
to
attract
and
buy
the
significance
of
all
things
material
he
now
wanted
the
magazine
to
be
representative
of
this
glowing
element
and
at
the
same
time
paradoxical
as
it
might
seem
the
best
that
might
be
in
literary
and
artistic
thought
naturally
the
thing
was
impossible
but
he
had
a
facile
and
specious
method
of
arguing
a
most
gay
and
in
some
respects
magnetic
personality
far
from
stodgy
or
gross
which
for
a
time
attracted
many
to
him
very
briskly
then
indeed
he
proceeded
to
make
friends
with
all
those
with
whom
i
had
surrounded
myself
to
enter
into
long
and
even
private
discussions
with
them
as
to
the
proper
conduct
of
the
magazine
to
hint
quite
broadly
at
a
glorious
future
in
which
all
each
one
particularly
to
whom
he
talked
was
to
share
curiously
this
new
and
as
i
would
have
thought
inimical
personality
of
m
seemed
to
appeal
to
l
very
much
i
do
not
claim
that
the
result
was
fatal
it
may
even
or
at
least
might
have
had
value
combined
with
an
older
or
slightly
more
balanced
temperament
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
offered
too
quickly
what
should
have
come
if
at
all
as
the
result
of
much
effort
for
in
regard
to
the
very
things
l
should
have
most
guarded
against
show
and
the
shallow
pleasures
of
social
and
night
and
material
life
in
new
york
m
was
most
specious
i
never
knew
a
more
intriguing
and
fascinating
man
in
this
respect
nor
one
who
cared
less
for
those
he
used
to
obtain
his
unimportant
ends
he
had
positive
genius
for
making
the
gaudy
and
the
unworthy
seem
worthy
and
even
perfect
during
his
earlier
days
there
l
had
more
than
once
cursed
him
out
in
his
absence
of
course
to
use
his
own
expressive
phrase
for
his
trade
views
as
he
described
them
his
shabby
social
and
material
ideals
and
yet
as
i
could
plainly
see
even
at
that
time
the
virus
of
his
theories
was
working
for
it
must
be
remembered
that
l
was
very
new
to
new
york
very
young
and
never
having
had
much
of
anything
he
was
no
doubt
slightly
envious
of
the
man
material
facility
the
sense
of
exclusiveness
and
even
a
kind
of
petty
trade
grandeur
with
which
he
tried
to
surround
himself
well
that
might
not
have
proved
fatal
either
only
l
needed
some
one
to
keep
him
true
to
himself
his
individual
capabilities
to
constantly
caution
and
if
possible
sober
him
to
his
very
severe
taste
and
as
it
was
he
was
all
but
surrounded
by
acolytes
and
servitors
a
little
later
having
left
m
and
assumed
another
editorial
position
and
being
compelled
to
follow
the
various
current
magazines
more
or
less
professionally
i
was
disturbed
to
note
that
there
began
to
appear
in
various
publications
especially
m
which
was
flourishing
greatly
for
the
moment
stories
which
while
exhibiting
much
of
the
deftness
and
repression
as
well
as
an
avidity
for
the
true
color
of
things
still
showed
what
i
had
at
first
feared
they
might
a
decided
compromise
that
curse
of
all
american
fiction
the
necessarily
happy
ending
had
been
impressed
on
him
by
whom
to
my
sincere
dissatisfaction
he
began
writing
stories
some
at
least
which
concerned
a
young
woman
who
successfully
abandoned
art
dreams
for
advertising
a
charmer
female
who
attempted
and
was
defeated
american
style
a
christmas
picture
with
sweetness
and
light
reigning
on
every
hand
dickens
at
his
sentimentalest
could
have
done
no
worse
a
broadway
press
agent
who
attempting
to
bring
patronage
to
a
great
hotel
via
chic
vice
accidentally
and
unintentionally
mates
an
young
society
man
turned
hotel
manager
to
a
grand
heiress
and
so
on
and
so
on
not
ad
infinitum
but
for
a
period
at
least
the
ten
years
in
which
he
managed
to
live
and
work
and
what
was
more
during
this
new
period
i
heard
and
occasionally
saw
discouraging
things
in
connection
with
him
from
time
to
time
true
to
his
great
promise
for
i
sincerely
think
m
had
a
genuine
fondness
for
his
young
protégé
as
much
of
a
fondness
as
he
could
well
have
for
anything
he
guaranteed
him
perhaps
as
much
as
three
thousand
a
year
sent
him
to
stockholm
at
the
age
of
or
to
meet
and
greet
the
famous
false
pole
discoverer
doctor
cook
allowed
him
to
go
to
paris
in
connection
with
various
articles
to
rome
sent
him
into
the
middle
and
far
west
to
broadway
for
dramatic
and
social
studies
well
and
good
only
he
wanted
always
in
what
was
done
for
him
the
uplift
note
the
happy
ending
or
at
least
one
not
vulgar
or
low
whereas
my
idea
in
connection
with
l
gifted
as
he
was
was
that
he
should
confine
himself
to
fiction
as
an
art
and
without
any
regard
to
theories
or
types
of
ending
believing
as
i
did
that
he
would
definitely
establish
himself
in
that
way
in
the
long
run
i
had
no
objection
of
course
to
experiences
of
various
kinds
his
taking
up
with
any
line
of
work
which
might
seem
at
the
moment
far
removed
from
realistic
writing
providing
always
that
the
star
of
his
ideal
was
in
sight
whenever
he
wrote
be
it
early
or
late
it
must
be
in
the
clear
incisive
uncompromising
vein
of
these
first
stories
and
with
that
passion
for
revelation
which
characterized
him
at
first
that
same
unbiased
and
unfettered
viewpoint
but
after
meeting
with
and
working
for
m
under
this
new
arrangement
and
being
apparently
fascinated
for
the
moment
by
his
personality
he
seemed
to
me
to
gradually
lose
sight
of
his
ideal
to
be
actually
taken
in
by
the
plausible
arguments
which
the
latter
could
spin
with
the
ease
that
a
spider
spins
gossamer
in
that
respect
i
insist
that
m
was
a
bad
influence
under
his
tutelage
l
gradually
became
for
instance
an
habitué
of
a
and
a
most
mawkish
and
naïvely
imitative
affair
intended
frankly
to
be
a
copy
or
even
the
original
forsooth
of
an
old
english
inn
done
in
so
far
as
its
woodwork
was
concerned
in
smoked
or
oak
to
represent
an
old
english
interior
its
walls
covered
with
pipes
and
pictures
of
english
hunting
and
drinking
scenes
its
but
unvarnished
tables
littered
with
riding
driving
and
society
papers
to
give
it
that
air
of
with
an
upper
world
of
which
its
habitués
probably
possessed
no
least
inkling
but
most
eagerly
craved
here
along
with
a
goodly
group
of
his
friends
far
different
from
those
by
whom
he
had
first
been
surrounded
a
pretentious
society
poet
of
no
great
merit
but
considerable
a
wall
street
broker
posing
as
a
club
man
and
what
not
and
several
young
and
ambitious
playwrights
all
seeking
the
heaven
of
a
broadway
success
he
began
to
pose
as
one
of
the
intimates
of
the
great
city
its
bosom
child
as
it
were
the
cynosure
and
favorite
of
its
most
glittering
precincts
a
most
m
proceeding
his
clothes
by
now
for
i
saw
him
on
occasion
had
taken
on
a
more
lustrous
if
less
convincing
aspect
than
those
he
had
worn
when
i
first
knew
him
the
small
round
hat
or
rakish
cap
typical
of
his
western
dreams
had
now
given
way
to
a
most
pretentious
derby
beloved
i
believe
of
undertakers
and
a
certain
severe
type
of
banker
as
well
as
some
clergymen
only
it
was
a
light
brown
his
suit
and
waistcoat
were
of
a
bright
english
tweed
or
gray
by
turns
his
shoes
perfections
of
the
button
type
he
carried
a
heavy
cane
often
a
bright
leather
manuscript
case
and
seemed
intensely
absorbed
in
the
great
and
dramatic
business
of
living
and
writing
one
must
so
i
read
him
at
this
time
take
the
pleasures
as
well
as
the
labors
of
this
world
with
the
utmost
severity
here
with
a
grand
manner
he
patronized
the
manager
and
the
waiters
sent
word
to
his
friend
the
cook
who
probably
did
not
know
him
at
all
that
his
chop
or
steak
was
to
be
done
just
so
these
friends
of
his
or
at
least
one
of
them
the
poet
he
met
every
day
at
five
for
an
game
of
chess
after
which
an
evening
paper
was
read
and
the
chop
ordered
ale
not
beer
in
a
pewter
mug
was
il
the
only
thing
for
a
gentleman
of
letters
worthy
of
the
name
to
drink
i
am
sorry
to
write
so
for
after
all
youth
must
have
its
fling
still
i
had
expected
better
of
l
and
i
was
a
little
disappointed
to
see
that
earlier
dream
of
simplicity
and
privation
giving
way
to
an
absolutely
worthless
show
besides
twenty
or
thirty
such
stories
as
the
right
man
sweet
dreams
the
man
with
the
broken
fingers
the
second
motive
would
outweigh
a
thousand
of
the
things
he
was
getting
published
and
the
profits
of
which
permitted
him
these
airs
again
during
the
early
days
of
his
success
with
m
he
had
married
a
young
nurse
who
had
previously
been
a
clerk
in
a
store
a
serious
earnest
and
from
one
point
of
view
helpful
person
seeing
that
she
could
keep
his
domestic
affairs
in
order
and
bear
him
children
which
she
did
but
she
had
no
understanding
of
or
flair
for
the
type
of
thing
he
was
called
upon
to
do
she
had
no
instinct
for
literature
or
the
arts
and
aside
from
her
domestic
capacities
little
skill
or
taste
for
socializing
and
naturally
he
was
neglecting
her
his
head
was
probably
surging
with
great
ideas
of
art
and
hence
a
social
supremacy
which
might
well
carry
him
anywhere
he
had
bought
a
farm
some
distance
from
new
york
where
in
a
community
supposedly
inhabited
by
successful
and
superior
men
of
letters
he
posed
as
a
farmer
at
times
mowing
and
cocking
hay
as
became
a
western
and
also
as
the
mood
moved
him
and
as
became
a
great
and
secluded
writer
working
in
a
den
entirely
surrounded
by
books
in
fine
leather
bindings
and
being
visited
by
those
odd
satellites
of
the
scriptic
art
who
see
in
genius
of
this
type
the
of
life
it
was
the
thing
to
do
at
that
time
for
a
writer
to
own
a
farm
and
work
it
horace
had
one
individual
in
particular
a
man
of
genuine
literary
and
critical
ability
and
great
taste
in
the
matter
of
all
the
arts
but
with
no
least
interest
in
or
tolerance
for
the
simplicities
of
effort
came
here
occasionally
as
i
heard
to
help
him
pile
hay
and
this
in
a
silk
shirt
and
a
monocle
a
second
and
a
most
fascinating
intellectual
who
however
had
no
vision
or
the
gift
of
dreams
came
to
eat
drink
talk
of
many
things
to
be
done
to
steal
a
few
ideas
borrow
a
little
money
perhaps
or
consume
a
little
morphine
and
depart
a
third
came
to
spout
of
his
success
in
connection
with
plays
or
his
proposed
successes
a
fourth
to
paint
a
picture
urged
on
by
l
a
fifth
to
compose
rural
verse
a
sixth
a
broker
or
tout
or
city
for
color
this
last
to
marvel
that
one
of
l
sense
or
any
one
indeed
should
live
in
the
country
at
all
there
were
drinking
bouts
absolute
drunkenness
in
which
according
to
the
johnsonian
tradition
and
that
of
messieurs
rabelais
and
molière
the
weary
intellect
and
one
guiding
genius
were
immersed
in
a
comforting
lethe
of
rye
such
things
cost
money
however
in
addition
my
young
friend
due
to
a
desire
no
doubt
to
share
in
the
material
splendors
of
his
age
a
doctrine
m
was
ever
fond
of
spouting
and
as
a
duty
if
you
please
had
saddled
himself
for
a
time
at
least
with
an
apartment
in
an
exclusive
square
on
the
east
side
the
rent
of
which
was
a
severe
drain
before
this
there
had
been
and
after
it
were
still
others
obligations
too
much
for
him
to
bear
financially
all
in
the
main
taken
for
show
that
he
might
be
considered
a
literary
success
now
and
again
so
i
was
told
by
several
of
his
intimates
confronted
by
a
sudden
exhaustion
of
his
bank
balance
he
would
leave
some
excellent
apartment
house
or
neighborhood
where
for
a
few
months
he
had
been
living
in
grand
style
extracting
his
furniture
as
best
he
might
or
leaving
it
and
various
debts
beside
and
would
take
refuge
in
some
shabby
tenement
or
rear
rooms
even
and
where
touched
by
remorse
or
encouraged
by
the
great
literary
and
art
traditions
balzac
baudelaire
johnson
goldsmith
verlaine
he
would
toil
unendingly
at
definite
manuscripts
the
results
of
which
carried
to
some
would
yield
him
sufficient
to
return
to
the
white
lights
often
even
to
take
a
better
apartment
than
that
which
last
had
been
his
by
now
however
one
of
the
two
children
he
eventually
left
behind
him
had
been
born
his
domestic
cares
were
multiplying
the
marriage
idea
dull
still
he
did
not
hesitate
to
continue
those
dinners
given
to
his
friends
the
group
or
its
spiritual
kin
either
in
his
apartment
or
in
a
bohemian
restaurant
of
great
show
in
new
york
in
short
he
was
a
fairly
successful
writer
and
critic
in
whom
still
persisted
a
feeling
that
he
would
yet
triumph
in
the
adjacent
if
somewhat
more
difficult
field
of
popular
fiction
it
was
during
this
period
if
i
may
interpolate
an
incident
that
i
was
waiting
one
night
in
a
broadway
theater
lobby
for
a
friend
to
appear
when
who
should
arrive
on
the
scene
but
l
most
outlandishly
dressed
in
what
i
took
to
be
a
ad
of
his
first
pose
as
i
now
it
to
be
that
of
the
uncouth
and
rugged
young
american
disclaiming
style
in
dress
at
least
and
content
to
be
a
clod
in
looks
so
long
as
he
was
a
shelley
in
brains
his
suit
was
of
that
coarse
character
described
as
store
and
his
shoes
all
but
dusty
brogans
his
headgear
a
cap
he
had
on
a
short
frieze
overcoat
his
hands
stuck
defiantly
in
his
trousers
pockets
forcing
its
lapels
wide
open
and
he
appeared
to
be
partially
if
not
entirely
drunk
and
very
insolent
i
had
the
idea
that
the
drunkenness
and
the
dress
were
a
pose
or
else
that
he
had
been
in
some
neighborhood
in
search
of
copy
which
required
such
an
outfit
charitably
let
us
accept
the
last
he
was
accompanied
by
two
satellic
souls
who
were
doing
their
best
to
restrain
him
come
now
do
make
a
scene
we
see
the
show
all
right
sure
we
see
the
show
he
returned
contentiously
where
the
manager
a
smug
mannikin
whose
uniform
was
a
dress
suit
the
business
manager
himself
eyed
him
in
no
friendly
spirit
from
a
nearby
corner
this
is
l
one
of
the
satellites
now
approached
and
explained
to
the
manager
he
connected
with
m
magazine
he
does
short
stories
and
dramatics
occasionally
the
manager
bowed
after
all
m
magazine
had
come
to
have
some
significance
on
broadway
it
was
as
well
to
be
civil
courtesy
was
extended
for
three
and
they
went
in
as
for
myself
i
resented
the
mood
and
the
change
it
was
in
no
way
my
affair
his
life
was
his
own
and
still
i
resented
it
i
did
not
believe
that
he
was
as
bad
as
he
seemed
he
had
too
much
genuine
sense
it
was
just
boyish
swagger
and
show
and
still
it
was
time
that
he
was
getting
over
that
and
settling
down
i
really
hoped
that
time
would
modify
all
this
one
thing
that
made
me
hope
for
the
best
was
that
very
shortly
after
this
m
magazine
blew
completely
up
leaving
him
without
that
protection
which
i
felt
was
doing
him
so
much
harm
the
next
favorable
sign
that
i
observed
was
that
a
small
volume
of
short
stories
some
sixteen
in
number
and
containing
the
cream
of
his
work
up
to
that
time
was
brought
to
a
publishing
house
with
which
i
was
financially
identified
at
the
time
and
although
no
word
was
said
to
me
i
really
think
he
took
great
care
not
to
see
me
still
it
was
left
and
on
my
advice
eventually
published
it
sold
i
believe
a
little
under
five
hundred
copies
but
the
thing
that
cheered
me
was
that
it
contained
not
one
story
which
could
be
looked
upon
as
a
compromise
with
his
first
views
and
better
it
had
been
brought
to
the
concern
with
which
i
was
connected
intentionally
i
am
sure
i
was
glad
to
have
had
a
hand
in
its
publication
at
least
i
said
he
has
not
lost
sight
of
his
first
ideal
he
may
go
on
now
and
thereafter
in
one
magazine
and
another
excellent
enough
to
have
but
a
small
circulation
i
saw
something
of
his
which
had
genuine
merit
a
western
critical
journal
began
to
publish
a
series
of
essays
by
him
for
which
i
am
sure
he
received
nothing
at
all
again
three
or
four
years
later
a
second
volume
of
stories
almost
if
not
quite
as
good
as
his
first
was
issued
by
this
same
western
paper
he
was
trying
to
do
serious
work
but
he
still
sought
and
apparently
craved
those
grand
scenes
on
the
farm
or
in
some
new
york
restaurant
or
an
expensive
apartment
and
when
he
could
no
longer
afford
it
he
still
wrote
or
compromise
stories
for
any
such
magazine
as
would
receive
him
and
was
apparently
building
up
a
reasonably
secure
market
for
them
in
the
meantime
the
scenario
market
had
developed
and
he
wrote
for
it
his
eyes
were
also
turning
toward
the
stage
as
one
completed
manuscript
and
several
starts
turned
over
to
me
after
his
death
proved
one
day
some
one
who
knew
him
and
me
quite
well
assured
me
that
l
having
sent
out
many
excellent
stories
only
to
have
them
returned
had
one
day
cried
and
then
raged
cursing
america
for
its
attitude
toward
serious
letters
an
excellent
sign
i
thought
good
medicine
for
one
who
must
eventually
forsake
his
hope
of
material
grandeur
and
find
himself
in
time
in
time
i
said
he
will
eat
through
the
husks
of
these
other
things
the
complex
and
do
something
splendid
he
ca
help
it
but
this
fantastic
dream
of
grandeur
of
being
a
popular
success
will
have
to
be
lived
down
for
a
time
now
i
heard
but
little
more
save
once
that
he
was
connected
with
a
concern
suggesting
plots
and
making
some
money
then
i
saw
a
second
series
of
essays
in
the
same
western
critical
paper
that
of
the
editor
who
had
published
his
book
and
some
of
them
were
excellent
very
searching
and
sincere
i
felt
that
he
was
moving
along
the
right
line
although
they
earned
him
nothing
then
one
week
very
much
to
my
surprise
there
was
a
very
glowing
and
extended
commentary
on
myself
concerning
which
for
the
time
being
i
decided
to
make
no
comment
and
a
little
later
perhaps
three
weeks
a
telephone
call
did
i
recall
him
could
he
come
and
see
me
i
invited
him
to
dinner
and
he
came
carrying
of
all
things
and
for
him
the
boy
a
great
armful
of
red
roses
this
touched
me
what
the
idea
i
inquired
jovially
laughing
at
him
he
blushed
like
a
girl
a
little
irritably
too
i
thought
for
he
found
me
as
perhaps
he
had
hoped
not
to
examining
and
critical
and
he
may
have
felt
that
i
was
laughing
at
him
which
i
was
i
wished
to
give
them
to
you
and
i
brought
why
should
i
you
know
you
should
bring
them
if
you
want
me
to
have
them
and
only
too
glad
to
get
them
anyway
do
think
i
criticizing
he
smiled
and
began
at
once
on
the
old
days
as
he
now
called
them
a
sad
commentary
on
our
drifting
days
indeed
he
seemed
able
to
talk
of
little
else
or
fast
enough
or
with
too
much
enthusiasm
he
went
over
many
things
and
people
m
k
the
wonderful
now
insane
and
a
wreck
the
group
of
which
he
and
i
had
once
been
a
part
his
youthful
and
unsophisticated
viewpoint
at
the
time
you
know
he
confessed
quite
frankly
finally
my
mother
always
told
me
then
and
afterwards
that
i
made
a
mistake
in
leaving
you
you
were
the
better
influence
for
me
she
was
right
i
know
it
now
still
a
life
a
life
and
we
have
to
work
through
it
and
ourselves
somehow
i
agreed
heartily
he
told
me
of
his
wife
children
farm
his
health
and
his
difficulties
it
appeared
that
he
was
making
a
bare
living
at
times
at
others
doing
very
well
his
great
bane
was
the
popular
magazine
the
difficulty
of
selling
a
good
thing
it
was
true
i
said
and
at
midnight
he
left
promising
to
come
again
inviting
me
to
come
to
his
place
in
the
country
at
my
convenience
i
promised
but
one
thing
and
another
interfered
i
went
south
one
day
six
months
later
after
i
had
returned
he
called
up
once
more
saying
he
wished
to
see
me
of
course
i
asked
him
down
and
he
came
and
spoke
of
his
health
some
doctor
an
old
college
pal
of
his
was
assuring
him
that
he
had
bright
disease
and
that
he
might
die
at
any
time
he
wanted
to
know
in
case
anything
happened
to
him
would
i
look
after
his
many
most
of
which
the
most
serious
efforts
at
least
had
never
been
published
i
agreed
then
he
went
away
and
i
never
saw
him
again
a
year
later
i
was
one
day
informed
that
he
had
died
three
days
before
of
kidney
trouble
he
had
been
west
to
see
a
director
on
his
way
east
he
had
been
taken
ill
and
had
stopped
off
with
friends
somewhere
to
be
treated
or
operated
upon
a
few
weeks
later
he
had
returned
to
new
york
but
refusing
to
rest
and
believing
that
he
could
not
die
so
soon
had
kept
out
of
doors
and
in
the
city
until
suddenly
he
did
collapse
or
rather
he
met
his
favorite
doctor
an
intellectual
savage
like
himself
who
with
some
weird
desire
to
appear
forceful
definite
unsentimental
perhaps
a
mental
condition
l
most
fancied
had
told
him
to
go
home
and
to
bed
for
he
would
be
dead
in
hours
a
fine
bit
of
assurance
which
perhaps
as
much
as
anything
else
assisted
l
to
die
at
any
rate
and
in
spite
of
the
ministrations
of
his
wife
who
wished
to
defy
the
doctor
and
who
in
her
hope
for
herself
and
her
children
as
well
as
him
strove
to
contend
against
this
gloom
he
did
so
go
to
bed
and
did
die
on
the
last
day
realizing
no
doubt
how
utterly
indifferent
his
life
had
been
how
his
main
aspirations
or
great
dreams
had
been
in
the
main
nullified
by
passions
necessities
crass
chance
how
well
he
was
fitted
to
understand
that
he
broke
down
and
cried
for
hours
then
he
died
a
friend
who
had
known
much
of
this
last
period
said
to
me
rather
satirically
he
was
dealing
with
death
in
the
shape
of
a
medic
have
you
ever
seen
him
the
doctor
he
meant
he
looks
like
an
advertisement
for
an
undertaker
i
do
believe
he
was
trying
to
discover
whether
he
could
kill
somebody
by
the
power
of
suggestion
and
he
met
l
in
the
nick
of
time
you
know
how
really
sensitive
he
was
well
that
medic
killed
him
the
same
as
you
would
kill
a
bird
with
a
bullet
he
said
already
dead
and
he
was
and
oh
yes
m
his
former
patron
at
the
time
of
l
sickness
and
death
he
was
still
owing
him
for
services
rendered
during
the
last
days
of
that
unfortunate
magazine
he
had
never
been
called
upon
to
pay
his
debts
for
he
had
sunk
through
one
easy
trapdoor
of
bankruptcy
only
to
rise
out
of
another
smiling
and
with
the
means
to
continue
yes
he
was
rich
again
rated
a
no
the
president
of
a
great
corporation
and
with
l
still
unpaid
and
now
not
legally
collectible
his
bank
balance
established
by
a
friend
at
the
time
was
exactly
one
hundred
thousand
but
l
anxious
to
find
some
way
out
of
her
difficulty
since
her
husband
was
lying
cold
and
knowing
of
no
one
else
to
whom
to
turn
had
written
to
him
there
was
no
food
in
the
house
no
medicine
no
way
to
feed
the
children
at
the
moment
that
matter
of
now
could
he
spare
a
little
l
had
thought
a
letter
in
answer
was
not
long
in
arriving
and
a
most
moving
m
y
document
it
was
m
had
been
stunned
by
the
dreadful
news
stunned
could
it
really
be
could
it
his
young
brilliant
friend
impossible
at
the
dread
pathetic
news
he
had
cried
yes
he
had
cried
and
cried
and
cried
and
then
he
had
even
cried
some
more
life
was
so
sad
so
grim
as
for
him
his
own
affairs
were
never
in
so
wretched
a
condition
it
was
unfortunate
debts
there
were
on
every
hand
they
haunted
him
robbed
him
of
his
sleep
he
himself
scarcely
knew
which
way
to
turn
they
stood
in
serried
ranks
his
debts
a
slight
push
on
the
part
of
any
one
and
he
would
be
crushed
crushed
go
down
in
ruin
and
so
as
much
as
he
was
torn
and
as
much
as
he
cried
even
now
he
could
do
nothing
nothing
nothing
he
was
agonized
beaten
to
earth
but
still
then
having
signed
it
there
was
a
or
an
this
stated
that
in
looking
over
his
affairs
he
had
just
discovered
that
by
stinting
himself
in
another
direction
he
manage
to
scrape
together
dollars
and
this
he
was
enclosing
would
that
god
had
designed
that
he
should
be
better
placed
at
this
sad
hour
however
that
may
be
i
at
once
sent
for
the
mss
and
they
came
a
jumbled
mass
in
two
suitcases
and
a
portfolio
and
a
third
suitcase
so
i
was
informed
containing
all
of
a
hundred
mostly
stories
had
been
lost
somewhere
there
had
been
much
financial
trouble
of
late
and
more
than
one
enforced
move
l
had
been
compelled
but
i
will
not
tell
all
suffice
it
to
say
that
he
had
such
an
end
as
his
own
realistic
pen
might
have
satirically
craved
the
finally
sorted
tabulated
and
read
yielded
two
small
volumes
of
excellent
tales
all
unpublished
the
published
material
being
all
but
uniformly
worthless
there
was
also
the
attempt
at
a
popular
comedy
previously
mentioned
a
sad
affair
and
a
volume
of
essays
as
well
as
a
very
very
slender
but
charming
volume
of
verse
in
case
a
publisher
could
ever
be
found
for
them
a
most
agreeable
little
group
showing
a
pleasing
sense
of
form
and
color
and
emotion
i
arranged
them
as
best
i
could
and
finally
but
they
are
still
unpublished
as
for
the
sum
total
of
the
work
left
by
l
its
very
best
it
might
be
said
that
although
he
was
not
a
great
psychologist
still
owing
to
a
certain
pretentiousness
of
assertion
at
times
one
might
unthinkingly
suppose
he
was
neither
had
he
as
yet
any
fixed
theories
of
art
or
definite
style
of
his
own
imitating
as
he
was
now
de
maupassant
now
henry
now
poe
but
also
it
must
be
said
that
slowly
and
surely
he
was
approximating
one
original
and
forceful
and
in
expression
and
naturalness
at
times
he
veered
to
a
rather
showy
technique
at
others
to
a
cold
and
even
harsh
simplicity
yet
always
in
the
main
he
had
color
beauty
emotion
poignance
when
necessary
like
his
idol
de
maupassant
he
had
no
moral
or
strong
social
prejudices
no
really
great
or
disturbing
imagination
no
wealth
of
perplexing
ideas
he
saw
america
and
life
as
something
to
be
painted
as
all
masters
see
life
and
paint
it
gifted
with
a
true
vein
of
satire
he
had
not
at
the
time
of
his
death
quite
mastered
its
possibilities
he
still
retained
prejudice
of
one
type
or
another
which
he
permitted
to
interfere
with
the
very
smooth
arrangement
of
his
colors
at
the
same
time
had
he
not
been
disturbed
by
so
many
of
the
things
which
in
america
as
elsewhere
ordinarily
assail
an
ambitious
and
earnest
writer
the
prejudice
against
naturalness
and
sincerity
in
matters
of
the
intellect
and
the
facts
of
life
and
the
consequent
difficulty
of
any
one
so
gifted
in
obtaining
funds
at
any
time
he
might
have
done
much
better
sooner
he
was
certain
to
come
into
his
own
eventually
had
he
lived
his
very
accurate
and
sensitive
powers
of
observation
his
literary
taste
his
energy
and
pride
in
his
work
were
destined
to
carry
him
there
it
could
not
have
been
otherwise
ten
years
more
judging
by
the
rate
at
which
he
worked
his
annual
product
and
that
which
he
did
leave
one
might
say
that
in
the
pantheon
of
american
letters
it
is
certain
that
he
would
have
proved
a
durable
if
not
one
of
its
great
figures
and
he
might
well
have
been
that
as
it
stands
it
is
not
impossible
that
he
will
be
so
recognized
if
for
no
more
than
the
sure
promise
of
his
genius
village
in
a
certain
connecticut
sometime
since
where
besides
lobstering
a
shipyard
and
some
there
existed
the
several
shops
and
stores
which
catered
to
the
wants
of
those
who
labored
in
those
lines
there
dwelt
a
groceryman
by
the
name
of
elihu
burridge
whose
life
and
methods
strongly
point
the
moral
and
social
successes
and
failures
of
the
rural
man
sixty
years
of
age
with
the
vanities
and
desires
of
the
average
life
behind
rather
than
before
him
he
was
at
the
time
not
unlike
the
conventional
drawings
of
parson
thirdly
which
graced
the
humorous
papers
of
that
day
two
eyes
a
long
upper
lip
a
mouth
like
the
sickle
moon
turned
downward
prominent
ears
a
rather
long
face
and
a
whisker
on
either
cheek
served
to
give
him
that
clerical
appearance
which
the
humorous
artists
so
religiously
seek
to
depict
add
to
this
that
he
was
clerically
spare
in
form
reserved
and
quiet
in
demeanor
and
one
can
see
how
he
might
very
readily
give
the
impression
of
being
a
minister
his
clothes
however
were
old
his
trousers
torn
but
neatly
mended
his
little
blue
gingham
jumper
which
he
wore
about
the
store
greasy
and
aged
everything
about
him
and
his
store
was
so
still
and
dark
that
one
might
have
been
inclined
on
first
sight
to
consider
him
crusty
and
morose
even
more
remarkable
than
himself
however
was
his
store
i
have
seen
many
in
my
time
that
were
striking
because
of
their
neatness
i
never
saw
one
before
that
struck
me
as
more
remarkable
for
its
disorder
in
the
first
place
it
was
filled
with
barrels
and
boxes
in
the
utmost
confusion
dark
greasy
alleys
led
off
into
dingy
sections
which
the
eye
could
not
penetrate
old
signs
hung
about
advertising
things
which
had
long
since
ceased
to
sell
and
were
forgotten
by
the
public
there
were
pictures
in
once
gilt
but
now
frames
wherein
queerly
depicted
children
and
grocers
offered
one
commodity
and
another
all
now
almost
obliterated
by
shelves
were
marked
on
the
walls
by
signs
now
nearly
illegible
cobwebs
hung
thickly
from
corners
and
pillars
there
were
oil
lard
and
a
scum
of
some
sort
on
three
of
the
numerous
scales
with
which
he
occasionally
weighed
things
and
on
many
exteriors
of
once
salable
articles
pork
lard
molasses
and
nails
were
packed
in
different
corners
of
the
place
in
barrels
lying
about
were
household
utensils
furniture
and
a
hundred
other
things
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
grocery
business
as
i
entered
the
store
the
first
afternoon
i
noticed
a
bible
open
at
judges
and
a
number
of
slips
of
paper
on
which
questions
had
been
written
on
my
second
visit
for
oil
and
vinegar
two
strangers
from
off
a
vagrant
yacht
which
had
entered
the
little
harbor
nudged
one
another
and
demanded
to
know
whether
either
had
ever
seen
anything
like
it
on
the
third
my
companion
protested
that
it
was
not
clean
and
seeing
that
there
were
other
stores
we
decided
to
buy
our
things
elsewhere
this
was
not
so
easily
accomplished
where
can
i
get
a
flatiron
i
inquired
at
the
postoffice
when
i
first
entered
the
village
most
likely
at
burridge
was
the
reply
do
you
know
where
i
can
get
a
pair
of
i
asked
of
a
boy
who
was
lounging
about
the
town
dock
at
burridge
he
replied
when
we
wanted
oars
pickles
of
a
certain
variety
golden
syrup
and
a
dozen
other
things
which
were
essential
at
times
we
were
compelled
to
go
to
burridge
so
that
at
last
he
obtained
a
very
fair
portion
of
our
trade
despite
the
condition
of
his
store
during
all
these
earlier
dealings
there
cropped
up
something
curt
and
dry
in
his
conversation
one
day
we
lost
a
fruit
jar
which
he
had
loaned
and
i
took
one
very
much
like
it
back
in
its
place
when
i
began
to
apologize
he
interrupted
me
with
a
jar
a
jar
is
it
another
time
when
i
remarked
in
a
conciliatory
tone
that
he
owed
me
eight
cents
for
a
can
of
potted
ham
which
had
proved
stale
he
exclaimed
well
i
wo
owe
you
long
and
forthwith
pulled
the
money
out
of
the
loose
jacket
of
his
jumper
and
paid
me
i
inquired
one
day
if
a
certain
thing
were
good
if
it
is
he
replied
with
a
peculiar
elevation
of
the
eyebrows
your
money
is
you
can
have
that
back
that
the
way
you
do
business
is
it
yes
sir
he
replied
and
his
long
upper
lip
thinned
out
along
the
line
of
the
lower
one
like
a
vise
i
was
in
search
of
a
one
day
and
was
directed
to
burridge
as
the
only
place
likely
to
have
any
do
you
keep
furniture
i
inquired
some
he
said
have
you
a
no
sir
a
day
or
two
later
i
was
in
search
of
a
table
and
on
going
to
found
that
he
had
gone
to
a
neighboring
city
have
you
got
a
table
i
inquired
of
the
clerk
i
do
know
he
replied
there
some
furniture
in
the
back
room
but
i
do
know
as
i
dare
to
sell
any
of
it
while
he
away
why
well
he
do
like
me
to
sell
any
of
it
he
kind
of
queer
that
way
i
dunno
what
he
intends
to
do
with
it
gar
he
added
in
a
strangely
electric
way
he
a
queer
man
he
got
a
lot
of
things
back
there
chairs
and
tables
and
everything
he
got
a
lot
more
in
a
loft
up
the
street
here

i
shook
my
head
in
puzzled
desperation
come
on
let
go
back
and
look
anyway
there
no
harm
in
seeing
if
he
has
one
we
went
back
and
there
amid
pork
and
molasses
barrels
old
papers
boxes
and
signs
was
furniture
in
considerable
quantity
tables
washstands
bureaus

cornered
and
tumbled
about

of
them

could
not
till

comes
back
i
do
know
what

want
to
do
about
it
what

price
of
it
i
dunno
he
could
tell
you
i
went
out
of
the
stuffy
backroom
with
its
unwashed
windows
and
when
i
got
opposite
the
bible
near
the
door
i
said
what
the
matter
with
him
anyhow
why
does
he
straighten
things
out
here
again
the
clerk
awoke
huh
he
exclaimed

like
to
see
anybody

said
encouragingly
gar
he
chuckled
one
man
did
try
to
straighten
it
out
once
when
burridge
was
away
got
about
a
third
of
it
cleaned
up
when
he
come
back
gar
you
oughta
seen
him
gar
what
did
he
do
what
did

do
gar
just
took
things
an
threw
them
about

so
mixed
up
did
it
with
screws
an
everything
just
the
same
took
right
off
the
shelves
where
they
was
all
in
groups
an
scattered
all
over
the
room
gar
i
guess
i
can
find
something
when
i
want
it
he
said
the
clerk
paused
to
squint
and
add
there
ai
anybody
tried
any
straightenin
out
around
here
since
then
you
bet
gar
how
long
ago
has
that
been
about
fourteen
years
now
surprised
by
this
sharp
variation
from
the
ordinary
standards
of
trade
i
began
thinking
of
possible
conditions
which
had
produced
it
when
one
evening
i
happened
in
on
the
local
barber
he
was
a
lean
inquisitive
individual
with
a
shock
of
sandy
hair
and
a
conspicuous
desire
to
appear
a
social
factor
what
sort
of
person
is
this
burridge
over
here
he
keeps
such
a
peculiar
store
elihu
is
a
bit
peculiar
he
replied
his
smile
betraying
a
desire
to
appear
conservative
the
fault
with
elihu
if
he
has
one
is
that
terribly
strong
on
religion
ca
seem
to
agree
with
anybody
around
here
what
the
trouble
i
asked
it
i
could
ever
make
out
what
is
the
matter
with
him
all
a
little
bit
cracked
on
the
subject
around
here
nothing
but
revivals
and
meetin
year
in
and
year
out
they
stronger
on
it
winters
than
they
are
in
summer
how
do
you
mean
well
they
be
more
against
yachtin
and
sunday
pleasures
when
they
ca
go
than
when
they
can
what
about
elihu
i
asked
well
he
ca
seem
to
get
along
somehow
he
used
to
belong
to
the
baptist
church
but
he
got
out
o
that
then
he
went
to
a
church
up
in
graylock
but
he
had
a
fallin
out
up
there
then
he
went
to
northfield
and
eustis
he
been
all
around
even
over
on
long
island
he
goes
to
church
up
at
amherst
now
i
believe
what
seems
to
be
the
trouble
oh
he
just
i
guess
he
paused
and
ideas
lagged
until
finally
i
observed
it
a
very
interesting
store
he
keeps
it
just
as
billy
drumgold
told
him
once
he
says
got
everything
in
this
store
that
belongs
to
a
ship
one
thing
that
burridge
asks
pulpit
that
too
he
answered
and
takes
him
upstairs
and
there
he
had
one
sure
enough
well
i
said
what
was
he
doing
with
it
danged
if
i
know
he
had
it
all
right
has
it
yet
so
they
say
days
passed
and
as
the
summer
waned
the
evidences
of
a
peculiar
life
accumulated
noank
apparently
was
at
outs
with
burridge
on
the
subject
of
religion
and
he
with
it
there
were
instances
of
genuine
hard
feeling
against
him
writing
a
letter
in
the
postoffice
one
day
i
ventured
to
take
up
this
matter
with
the
postmaster
you
know
burridge
do
you
the
grocer
well
i
should
guess
i
did
he
replied
with
a
flare
anything
wrong
with
him
oh
about
everything
that
just
plain
cussed
the
most
wrangling
man
alive
i
never
saw
such
a
man
he
do
get
his
mail
here
no
more
because
he
mad
at
me
i
guess
took
it
away
because
i
had
help
in
my
fight
i
suppose
wrote
me
that
i
should
send
all
his
mail
up
to
mystic
and
he
goes
there
three
or
four
miles
out
of
his
way
every
day
just
to
spite
me
it
against
the
law
i
had
ought
to
be
doing
it
his
envelopes
three
or
four
times
a
day
but
i
do
do
it
he
a
man
that
the
trouble
with
elihu
i
had
no
time
to
follow
this
up
then
but
a
little
later
sitting
in
the
shop
of
the
principal
sailboat
maker
which
was
situated
in
the
quiet
little
lane
which
follows
the
line
of
the
village
i
was
one
day
surprised
by
the
sudden
warm
feeling
which
the
name
of
elihu
generated
something
had
brought
up
the
subject
of
religion
and
i
said
that
burridge
seemed
rather
religious
yes
said
the
sailboat
maker
quickly
he
religious
all
right
only
he
reads
the
bible
for
others
not
for
himself
what
do
you
mean
by
that
why
he
wants
to
run
things
that
what
as
long
as
you
agree
with
elihu
why
everything
all
right
when
you
do
the
bible
against
you
that
the
way
he
is
did
he
ever
disagree
with
you
i
asked
suspecting
some
personal
animus
in
the
matter
me
and
elihu
was
always
good
friends
as
long
as
i
agreed
with
him
he
went
on
bitterly
we
been
raised
together
man
and
boy
for
pretty
near
sixty
years
we
never
had
a
word
of
any
kind
but
what
was
friendly
as
long
as
i
agreed
with
him
but
just
as
soon
as
i
did
he
took
a
set
against
me
and
we
ai
never
spoke
a
word
since
what
was
the
trouble
i
inquired
sweetly
anxious
to
come
at
the
kernel
of
this
queer
situation
well
he
said
dropping
his
work
and
looking
up
to
impress
me
i
a
man
that
sometimes
say
what
i
do
believe
that
is
i
agree
with
what
i
had
ought
to
just
to
be
friendly
like
i
did
that
way
a
lot
o
times
with
elihu
till
one
day
he
came
to
me
with
something
about
particular
salvation
i
a
little
more
liberal
myself
i
believe
in
universal
redemption
by
faith
alone
well
elihu
came
to
me
and
began
telling
me
what
he
believed
finally
he
asked
me
something
about
particular
salvation
and
wanted
to
know
whether
i
did
agree
with
him
i
did
and
told
him
so
from
that
day
on
he
took
a
set
against
me
and
he
ai
never
spoke
a
word
to
me
since
i
was
unaware
that
there
was
anything
besides
a
religious
disagreement
in
this
local
situation
until
one
day
i
happened
to
come
into
a
second
friendly
contact
with
the
postmaster
we
were
speaking
of
the
characteristics
of
certain
individuals
and
i
mentioned
burridge
he
all
right
when
you
take
him
the
way
he
wants
to
be
taken
when
you
do
you
find
him
quite
a
different
man
he
seems
to
be
straightforward
and
honest
i
said
there
ai
anything
you
can
tell
me
about
elihu
burridge
that
i
know
he
replied
feelingly
not
a
thing
i
lived
with
him
as
you
might
say
all
my
life
been
raised
right
here
in
town
with
him
and
we
went
to
school
together
man
and
boy
there
ai
ever
been
a
thing
that
elihu
has
agreed
with
without
he
could
have
the
running
of
it
you
ca
tell
me
anything
about
him
that
i
do
know
i
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
warmth
of
feeling
although
something
about
the
man
manner
bespoke
a
touch
of
as
if
he
were
privately
grieving
what
was
the
trouble
between
you
two
i
asked
it
i
could
ever
find
out
he
replied
in
a
voice
that
was
really
mournful
so
difficult
and
was
the
subject
to
him
before
i
started
to
work
for
this
office
there
was
a
day
that
i
did
meet
and
speak
friendly
with
elihu
he
used
to
have
a
good
many
deeds
and
papers
to
sign
and
he
never
failed
to
call
me
in
when
i
was
passing
when
i
started
to
work
for
this
office
i
noticed
he
took
on
a
cold
manner
toward
me
and
i
tried
to
think
of
something
i
might
have
done
but
i
could
finally
i
wrote
and
asked
him
if
there
was
anything
between
us
if
he
would
set
a
time
and
place
so
we
might
talk
it
over
and
come
to
an
understanding
he
paused
and
then
added
i
wish
you
could
see
the
letter
he
wrote
me
comin
from
a
christian
man
from
him
to
me
i
wish
you
could
see
it
why
do
you
show
it
to
me
i
asked
inquisitively
he
went
back
into
the
office
and
returned
with
an
document
four
years
old
it
proved
to
be
which
he
had
been
treasuring
he
handed
me
the
thumbed
and
already
yellowed
page
and
i
read
matthew
holcomb
esquire
dear
sir
in
reply
to
your
letter
asking
me
to
set
a
time
and
place
in
which
we
might
talk
over
the
trouble
between
us
would
say
that
the
time
be
eternity
and
the
place
where
god
shall
call
us
to
judgment
very
truly
elihu
burridge
his
eyes
rested
on
me
while
i
read
and
the
moment
i
finished
he
began
with
i
never
said
one
word
against
that
man
not
one
word
i
never
did
a
thing
he
could
take
offense
at
not
one
thing
i
do
know
how
a
man
can
justify
himself
writing
like
that
perhaps
it
political
i
said
you
do
belong
to
the
same
party
do
you
yes
we
do
he
said
sometimes
i
thought
that
maybe
it
was
because
i
had
the
support
of
the
shipyard
when
i
first
tried
to
get
this
office
but
then
that
was
anything
between
him
and
me
and
he
looked
away
as
if
the
mystery
were
inexplicable
this
shipyard
was
conducted
by
a
most
forceful
man
but
one
as
narrow
and
religionistic
as
this
region
in
which
it
had
had
its
rise
old
palmer
the
aged
founder
of
it
had
long
been
a
notable
figure
in
the
streets
and
private
chambers
of
the
village
the
principal
grocery
store
hotel
and
other
institutions
were
conducted
in
its
interests
his
opinion
was
always
foremost
in
the
decision
of
the
local
authorities
he
was
still
reticent
unobtrusive
once
i
saw
him
most
considerately
helping
a
cripple
up
the
lane
to
the
local
baptist
church
what
the
trouble
between
burridge
and
palmer
i
asked
of
the
finally
coming
to
think
that
here
if
anywhere
lay
the
solution
of
the
difficulty
two
big
fish
in
too
small
a
basket
he
responded
laconically
ca
agree
eh
they
both
want
to
lead
or
did
he
said
elihu
a
beaten
man
though
now
he
paused
and
then
added
i
sorry
for
elihu
he
a
good
man
at
heart
one
of
the
kindest
men
you
ever
saw
when
you
let
him
follow
his
natural
way
he
good
to
the
poor
and
he
carried
more
people
than
any
man
in
this
country
i
do
believe
he
collect
an
old
debt
by
law
do
believe
in
it
no
sir
just
a
man
but
he
loves
to
rule
how
about
palmer
i
inquired
just
the
same
way
exactly
he
loves
to
rule
too
got
a
good
heart
too
but
he
got
a
lot
more
money
than
elihu
and
so
people
pay
more
attention
to
him
that
all
when
elihu
was
getting
the
attention
he
was
just
the
finest
man
you
ever
saw
kind
generous
people
love
to
be
petted
at
least
some
people
do
you
know
they
do
when
you
do
pet
they
get
kind
o
sour
and
crabbed
like
now
that
all
that
the
matter
with
elihu
every
bit
of
it
he
sour
now
and
a
little
lonely
i
expect
he
drove
away
every
one
from
him
or
nearly
all
his
wife
and
some
of
his
kin
anybody
can
do
a
good
grocery
business
here
with
the
strangers
off
the
boats
the
harbor
was
a
lively
one
all
you
have
to
do
is
carry
a
good
stock
that
why
he
gets
along
so
well
but
he
drove
nearly
all
the
local
folks
away
from
him
i
listened
to
this
comfortable
sage
and
going
back
to
the
grocery
store
one
afternoon
took
another
look
at
the
long
silent
figure
he
was
sitting
in
the
shadow
of
one
of
his
moldy
corners
and
if
there
had
ever
been
any
light
of
merriment
in
his
face
it
was
not
there
now
he
looked
as
fixed
and
solemn
as
an
ancient
puritan
and
yet
there
was
something
so
melancholy
in
the
man
eye
so
sad
and
disappointed
that
it
seemed
anything
but
hard
two
or
three
little
children
were
playing
about
the
door
and
when
he
came
forward
to
wait
on
me
one
of
them
sidled
forward
and
put
her
chubby
hand
in
his
your
children
i
asked
by
way
of
reaching
some
friendly
understanding
no
he
replied
looking
fondly
down
she
belongs
to
a
french
lady
up
the
street
here
she
often
comes
down
to
see
me
do
you
and
he
reached
over
and
took
the
fat
little
cheek
between
his
thumb
and
forefinger
the
little
one
rubbed
her
face
against
his
worn
baggy
trousers
leg
and
put
her
arm
about
his
knee
quietly
he
stood
there
in
a
simple
way
until
she
loosened
her
hold
upon
him
when
he
went
about
his
labor
i
was
sitting
one
day
in
the
loft
of
the
comfortable
who
by
the
way
was
to
burridge
when
i
said
to
him
i
wish
you
tell
me
the
details
about
elihu
how
did
he
come
to
be
what
he
is
you
ought
to
know
you
lived
here
all
your
life
so
i
do
know
he
replied
genially
what
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
the
whole
story
of
the
trouble
between
him
and
palmer
how
he
comes
to
be
at
outs
with
all
these
people
well
he
began
and
here
followed
with
many
interruptions
and
side
elucidations
which
for
want
of
space
have
been
eliminated
the
following
details
years
before
elihu
had
been
the
leading
citizen
of
noank
from
operating
a
small
grocery
at
the
close
of
the
civil
war
he
branched
out
until
he
sold
everything
from
to
hardware
noank
was
then
in
the
height
of
its
career
as
a
fishing
town
and
as
a
port
from
which
expeditions
of
all
sorts
were
wont
to
sail
whaling
was
still
in
force
and
vessels
for
whaling
expeditions
were
equipped
here
wealthy
frequently
loaded
fine
schooners
here
for
various
trading
expeditions
to
all
parts
of
the
world
the
fishers
for
mackerel
cod
and
herring
were
making
three
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
a
day
in
season
and
thousands
of
dollars
worth
of
supplies
were
annually
purchased
here
burridge
was
then
the
only
tradesman
of
any
importance
and
being
of
a
liberal
and
yet
religious
turn
attracted
the
majority
of
this
business
to
him
he
had
houses
and
lands
was
a
deacon
in
the
local
baptist
church
and
a
counselor
in
matters
political
social
and
religious
whose
advice
was
seldom
rejected
every
fourth
of
july
during
these
years
it
was
his
custom
to
collect
all
the
children
of
the
town
in
front
of
his
store
and
treat
them
to
every
christmas
eve
he
traveled
about
the
streets
in
a
wagon
which
carried
half
a
dozen
barrels
of
candy
and
nuts
which
he
would
ladle
out
to
the
merry
shouting
throng
of
pursuing
youngsters
until
all
were
satisfied
for
the
skating
season
he
prepared
a
pond
spending
several
thousand
dollars
damming
up
a
small
stream
in
order
that
the
children
might
have
a
place
to
skate
he
created
a
library
where
all
might
obtain
suitable
reading
particularly
the
young
on
new
year
morning
it
was
his
custom
to
visit
all
the
poor
and
bereaved
and
lonely
in
noank
taking
a
great
dray
full
of
presents
and
leaving
a
little
something
with
his
greetings
and
a
pleasant
handshake
at
every
door
the
lonely
rich
as
well
as
the
lonely
poor
were
included
for
he
was
certain
as
he
frequently
declared
that
the
rich
could
be
lonely
too
he
once
told
his
that
one
new
year
day
a
voice
called
to
him
in
church
elihu
burridge
how
about
the
lonely
rich
and
poor
of
noank
up
i
got
he
concluded
and
from
that
day
to
this
i
have
never
neglected
them
when
any
one
died
who
had
a
little
estate
to
be
looked
after
for
the
benefit
of
widows
or
orphans
burridge
was
the
one
to
take
charge
of
it
people
on
their
deathbeds
sent
for
him
and
he
always
responded
taking
energetic
charge
of
everything
and
refusing
to
take
a
penny
for
his
services
after
a
number
of
years
the
old
judge
to
whom
he
always
repaired
with
these
matters
of
probate
knowing
his
generosity
in
this
respect
also
refused
to
accept
any
fee
when
he
saw
him
coming
he
would
exclaim
well
elihu
what
is
it
this
time
another
widow
or
orphan
that
got
to
look
after
after
elihu
had
explained
what
it
was
he
would
add
well
elihu
i
do
hope
that
some
day
some
rich
man
will
call
you
to
straighten
out
his
affairs
i
like
to
see
get
a
little
something
so
that
might
get
a
little
something
eh
elihu
then
he
would
jocularly
poke
his
companion
in
charity
in
the
ribs
these
general
benefactions
were
continuous
and
coeval
with
his
local
prosperity
and
dominance
and
their
modification
as
well
as
the
general
decline
the
result
of
the
rise
of
this
other
individual
robert
palmer
operating
to
take
the
color
of
power
and
preëminence
from
him
palmer
was
the
owner
of
a
small
shipyard
here
at
the
time
a
thing
which
was
not
much
at
first
but
which
grew
swiftly
he
was
born
in
noank
also
a
few
years
before
burridge
and
as
a
builder
of
vessels
had
been
slowly
forging
his
way
to
a
moderate
competence
when
elihu
was
already
successful
he
was
a
keen
energetic
individual
with
excellent
commercial
and
strong
religious
instincts
and
by
dint
of
hard
labor
and
a
saving
disposition
he
obtained
soon
after
the
civil
war
a
powerful
foothold
many
vessels
were
ordered
here
from
other
cities
eventually
he
began
to
build
barges
in
large
numbers
for
a
great
railroad
company
early
becoming
a
larger
employer
of
labor
than
any
one
else
in
the
vicinity
he
soon
began
to
branch
out
possessed
himself
of
the
allied
industries
of
chandlering
and
finally
established
a
grocery
store
for
his
employees
and
opened
a
hotel
now
the
local
citizens
began
to
look
upon
him
as
their
leading
citizen
they
were
always
talking
of
his
rise
frequently
in
the
presence
of
burridge
he
said
nothing
at
first
pretending
to
believe
that
his
quondam
leadership
was
unimpaired
again
there
were
those
who
having
followed
the
various
branches
of
labor
which
palmer
eventually
consolidated
viewed
this
growth
with
sullen
and
angry
eyes
they
still
sided
with
burridge
or
pretended
still
to
believe
that
he
was
the
more
important
citizen
of
the
two
in
the
course
of
time
however
a
period
of
thirty
years
or
more
some
of
them
failed
others
died
still
others
were
driven
away
for
want
of
a
livelihood
only
burridge
position
and
business
remained
but
in
a
sadly
weakened
state
he
was
no
longer
a
man
of
any
great
importance
not
unnaturally
this
question
of
local
supremacy
was
first
tested
in
the
one
place
in
which
local
supremacy
is
usually
tested
the
church
where
they
both
worshiped
although
only
one
of
five
trustees
burridge
had
been
the
will
of
the
body
always
whatever
he
thought
the
others
had
almost
immediately
agreed
to
it
but
now
that
palmer
had
become
a
power
many
of
those
ardent
in
the
church
and
beholden
to
him
for
profit
became
his
humble
followers
they
elected
him
trustee
and
did
what
he
wished
or
what
they
thought
he
wished
to
burridge
this
made
them
sycophants
slaves
now
followed
the
kind
of
trivialities
by
which
most
human
feuds
are
furthered
the
first
test
of
strength
came
when
a
vagrant
evangelist
from
alabama
arrived
and
desired
to
use
the
church
for
a
series
of
evening
lectures
the
question
had
to
be
decided
at
once
palmer
was
absent
at
the
time
here
is
a
request
for
the
use
of
the
church
said
one
of
the
trustees
explaining
its
nature
well
said
burridge
you
better
let
him
have
it
do
you
think
we
ought
to
do
anything
about
it
the
trustee
replied
until
palmer
returns
although
burridge
saw
no
reason
for
waiting
the
other
trustees
did
and
upon
that
the
board
rested
burridge
was
furious
by
one
fell
stroke
he
was
put
in
second
place
a
man
who
had
to
await
the
return
of
palmer
and
that
in
his
own
church
so
to
speak
why
he
told
some
one
the
rest
of
us
are
nothing
this
man
is
a
king
from
that
time
on
differences
of
opinion
within
the
church
and
elsewhere
were
common
although
no
personal
animosity
was
ever
admitted
local
issues
almost
invariably
found
these
two
men
opposed
to
each
other
there
was
the
question
of
whether
the
village
should
be
made
into
a
borough
a
most
trivial
matter
another
that
of
creating
public
works
for
the
manufacture
of
gas
and
distribution
of
water
a
third
that
of
naming
a
state
representative
naturally
while
these
things
might
be
to
the
advantage
of
palmer
or
not
they
were
of
no
great
import
to
burridge
but
yet
he
managed
to
see
in
them
an
attempt
or
attempts
to
saddle
a
large
public
debt
upon
widows
and
orphans
those
who
could
not
afford
or
did
not
need
these
things
and
he
proceeded
to
so
express
himself
at
various
public
meetings
slowly
the
breach
widened
burridge
became
little
more
than
a
malcontent
in
many
people
eyes
he
was
a
knocker
a
man
who
wanted
to
hold
the
community
back
although
defeated
in
many
instances
he
won
in
others
and
this
did
not
help
matters
any
at
this
point
among
other
things
the
decay
of
the
fishing
industry
helped
to
fix
definitely
the
position
of
the
two
men
as
that
of
victor
and
vanquished
whaling
died
out
then
mackerel
and
cod
were
caught
only
at
farther
and
farther
distances
from
the
town
and
finally
and
even
schooners
ceased
entirely
to
buy
their
outfits
here
and
burridge
was
left
dependent
upon
local
patronage
or
smaller
harbor
trade
for
his
support
coextensively
he
had
the
dissatisfaction
of
seeing
palmer
industries
grow
until
eventually
three
hundred
and
fifty
men
were
upon
his
payrolls
and
even
his
foremen
and
superintendents
were
considered
influential
townspeople
son
and
two
daughters
grew
up
and
married
branched
out
and
became
owners
of
industries
which
had
formerly
belonged
to
men
who
had
traded
with
burridge
he
saw
his
grocery
trade
dwindle
and
sink
while
with
age
his
religiosity
grew
and
he
began
to
be
little
more
than
a
petty
disputant
one
constantly
arguing
as
to
whether
the
interpretation
of
the
bible
as
handed
down
from
the
pulpit
of
what
he
now
considered
recalcitrant
church
was
sound
or
not
when
those
who
years
before
had
followed
him
obediently
now
pricked
him
with
theological
pins
and
ventured
to
disagree
with
him
he
was
quick
and
sometimes
foolish
in
his
replies
thus
once
a
former
friend
and
who
had
gone
over
to
the
opposition
came
into
his
store
one
morning
and
said
elihu
for
a
man
that
as
strong
on
religion
as
you
are
i
see
you
do
one
thing
that
ca
quite
be
justified
by
the
book
what
that
inquired
burridge
looking
up
i
see
you
sell
tobacco
i
see
you
chew
it
returned
the
host
grimly
i
know
i
do
returned
his
visitor
but
i
tell
you
what
i
do
elihu
if
you
quit
selling
i
quit
chewing
it
and
he
looked
as
if
he
had
set
a
fancy
trap
for
his
brother
as
he
held
him
to
be
it
a
bargain
said
burridge
on
the
instant
it
a
bargain
and
from
that
day
on
tobacco
was
not
offered
for
sale
in
that
store
although
there
was
a
large
local
demand
for
it
again
in
the
pride
of
his
original
leadership
he
had
accepted
the
conduct
of
the
local
cemetery
a
thing
which
was
more
a
burden
than
a
source
of
profit
with
his
customary
liberality
in
all
things
reflecting
credit
upon
himself
he
had
spent
his
own
money
in
improving
it
much
more
than
ever
the
wardens
of
the
church
would
have
thought
of
returning
to
him
in
one
instance
when
a
new
receiving
vault
was
desired
he
had
added
seven
hundred
dollars
of
his
own
to
three
hundred
gathered
by
the
church
trustees
for
the
purpose
and
the
vault
was
immediately
constructed
frequently
also
in
his
pride
of
place
he
had
been
given
to
asserting
he
was
tired
of
conducting
the
cemetery
and
wished
he
could
resign
in
these
later
evil
days
therefore
the
trustees
following
the
star
of
the
newer
power
saw
fit
to
intimate
that
perhaps
some
one
else
would
be
glad
to
look
after
it
if
he
was
tired
of
it
instantly
the
fact
that
he
could
no
longer
boast
as
formerly
came
home
to
him
he
was
not
essential
any
longer
in
anything
the
church
did
not
want
him
to
have
a
hand
in
any
of
its
affairs
the
thought
of
this
so
weighed
on
him
that
eventually
he
resigned
from
this
particular
task
but
thereafter
also
every
man
who
had
concurred
in
accepting
his
resignation
was
his
bitter
enemy
he
spoke
acidly
of
the
seven
hundred
he
had
spent
and
jibed
at
the
decisions
of
the
trustees
in
other
matters
soon
he
became
a
disturbing
element
in
the
church
taking
a
solemn
vow
never
to
enter
the
graveyard
again
and
not
long
after
resigned
all
his
other
official
duties
passing
the
plate
et
cetera
although
he
still
attended
services
there
decoration
day
rolled
around
the
post
of
which
he
was
an
ardent
member
prepared
for
the
annual
memorial
services
over
the
graves
of
its
dead
comrades
early
on
the
morning
of
the
thirtieth
of
may
they
gathered
before
their
lodge
hall
burridge
among
them
and
after
arranging
the
details
marched
conspicuously
to
the
cemetery
where
the
placing
of
the
wreaths
and
the
firing
of
the
salute
were
to
take
place
no
one
thought
of
burridge
until
the
gate
was
reached
when
gun
over
shoulder
and
uniform
in
perfect
trim
he
fell
conspicuously
out
of
line
and
marched
away
home
alone
it
was
the
cemetery
he
had
vowed
not
to
enter
his
old
pet
and
protégé
men
now
looked
askance
at
him
he
was
becoming
queer
no
doubt
of
it
not
really
sensible
or
was
he
up
in
northfield
a
nearby
town
dwelt
a
colonel
of
the
civil
war
who
had
led
the
very
regiment
of
which
burridge
was
a
member
but
who
during
the
war
had
come
into
serious
difficulty
through
a
tangle
of
orders
and
had
been
dishonorably
discharged
although
wounded
in
one
of
the
engagements
in
which
the
regiment
had
distinguished
itself
he
had
been
allowed
to
languish
almost
forgotten
for
years
and
finally
failing
to
get
a
pension
had
died
in
poverty
on
his
deathbed
he
had
sent
for
burridge
and
reminding
him
of
the
battle
in
which
he
had
led
him
asked
that
after
he
was
gone
for
the
sake
of
his
family
he
would
take
up
the
matter
of
a
pension
and
if
possible
have
his
record
purged
of
the
stigma
and
the
pension
awarded
burridge
agreed
most
enthusiastically
going
to
the
local
congressman
he
at
once
began
a
campaign
but
because
of
the
feeling
against
him
two
years
passed
without
anything
being
done
later
he
took
up
the
matter
in
his
own
post
but
there
also
failing
to
find
the
measure
of
his
own
enthusiasm
he
went
finally
direct
to
one
of
the
senators
of
the
state
and
laying
the
matter
before
him
had
the
records
examined
by
congress
and
the
dead
colonel
honorably
discharged
one
day
thereafter
in
the
local
he
commented
unfavorably
upon
the
indifference
which
he
deemed
had
been
shown
there
would
have
been
half
so
much
delay
if
the
man
had
been
a
deserter
said
one
of
his
enemies
one
who
was
a
foreman
in
shipyard
instantly
burridge
was
upon
his
feet
his
eyes
aflame
with
feeling
always
an
orator
with
a
strangely
declamatory
style
he
launched
into
a
detailed
account
of
the
late
colonel
life
and
services
his
wounds
his
long
sufferings
and
final
death
in
poverty
winding
up
with
a
vivid
word
picture
of
a
battle
antietam
in
which
the
colonel
had
gallantly
captured
a
rebel
flag
and
come
by
his
injury
when
he
was
through
there
was
great
excitement
in
the
post
and
much
feeling
in
his
favor
but
he
rather
weakened
the
effect
by
at
once
demanding
that
the
traitorous
words
be
withdrawn
and
failing
to
compel
this
preferred
charges
against
the
man
who
had
uttered
them
and
attempted
to
have
him
so
great
was
the
bitterness
engendered
by
this
that
the
post
was
now
practically
divided
and
being
unable
to
compel
what
he
considered
justice
he
finally
resigned
subsequently
he
took
issue
with
his
former
in
various
ways
commenting
satirically
on
their
church
regularity
and
professed
christianity
as
opposed
to
their
indifference
to
the
late
colonel
and
denouncing
in
various
public
conversations
the
and
sharp
dealings
of
the
little
gods
as
he
termed
those
who
ran
the
post
the
church
and
the
shipyards
not
long
after
his
religious
affairs
reached
a
climax
when
the
minister
once
a
good
friend
of
his
following
the
lead
of
the
dominant
star
palmer
publicly
denounced
him
from
the
pulpit
one
sunday
as
an
enemy
of
the
church
and
of
true
christianity
there
is
a
man
in
this
congregation
he
exclaimed
in
a
burst
of
impassioned
oratory
who
poses
as
a
christian
and
a
baptist
who
is
in
his
heart
depth
the
church
worst
enemy
hell
and
all
its
devils
could
have
no
worse
feelings
of
evil
against
the
faith
than
he
and
he
does
sell
tobacco
either
the
last
reference
at
once
fixed
the
identity
of
the
person
and
caused
burridge
to
get
up
and
leave
the
church
he
pondered
over
this
for
a
time
severed
his
connections
with
the
body
and
having
visited
graylock
one
sunday
drove
there
every
sabbath
thereafter
each
time
going
to
a
different
church
after
enduring
this
for
six
months
he
generated
a
longing
for
a
more
convenient
and
finally
allied
himself
with
the
baptist
church
of
eustis
here
his
anchor
might
possibly
have
remained
fast
had
it
not
been
that
subtle
broodings
over
his
wrongs
a
calm
faith
in
the
righteousness
of
his
own
attitude
and
disgust
with
those
whom
he
saw
calmly
expatiating
upon
the
doctrines
and
dogmas
of
religion
in
his
own
town
finally
caused
him
to
suspect
a
universal
misreading
of
the
bible
this
doubt
together
with
his
own
desire
for
justification
according
to
the
word
finally
put
the
idea
in
his
mind
to
make
a
study
of
the
bible
himself
he
would
read
it
he
said
he
would
study
hebrew
and
greek
and
refer
all
questionable
readings
of
words
and
passages
back
to
the
original
tongue
in
which
it
had
been
written
with
this
end
in
view
he
began
a
study
of
these
languages
the
importance
of
the
subject
so
growing
upon
him
that
he
neglected
his
business
day
after
day
he
labored
putting
a
bible
and
a
concordance
upon
a
pile
of
near
the
door
of
his
store
and
poring
over
them
between
customers
the
store
meantime
taking
care
of
itself
he
finally
mastered
greek
and
hebrew
after
a
fashion
and
finding
the
word
repent
frequently
used
and
that
god
had
made
man
in
the
image
of
himself
with
a
full
knowledge
of
right
and
wrong
he
gravitated
toward
the
belief
that
therefore
his
traducers
in
noank
knew
what
they
were
doing
and
that
before
he
needed
to
forgive
them
though
his
love
might
cover
all
they
must
repent
he
read
the
bible
from
beginning
to
end
with
this
one
feeling
subconsciously
dominant
and
all
its
loving
commands
about
loving
one
another
forgiving
your
brother
seventy
times
seven
loving
those
that
hate
you
returning
good
for
evil
selling
all
that
you
have
and
giving
it
to
the
poor
were
made
to
wait
upon
the
duty
of
others
to
repent
he
began
to
give
this
interpretation
at
eustis
where
he
was
allowed
to
have
a
until
the
minister
came
and
told
him
once
to
his
face
as
the
local
report
ran
we
do
want
you
here
meekly
he
went
forth
and
joining
a
church
across
the
sound
on
long
island
sailed
over
every
sunday
and
there
advanced
the
same
views
until
he
was
personally
snubbed
by
the
minister
and
attacked
by
the
local
papers
leaving
there
he
went
to
amherst
always
announcing
now
that
he
held
distinctive
views
about
some
things
in
the
bible
and
asking
the
privilege
of
explaining
in
this
congregation
he
was
still
comfortably
at
rest
when
i
knew
him
all
sensitiveness
the
had
concluded
after
his
long
account
there
ai
anything
the
matter
with
elihu
except
that
piqued
and
grieved
he
wanted
to
be
the
big
man
and
he
was
i
was
thinking
of
this
and
of
his
tender
relationship
with
children
as
i
had
noticed
it
and
of
his
service
to
the
late
colonel
when
one
day
being
in
the
store
i
said
do
you
stand
on
the
bible
completely
mr
burridge
yes
sir
he
replied
i
do
believe
every
word
of
it
to
be
true
yes
sir
if
your
brother
has
offended
you
how
many
times
must
you
forgive
him
seventy
times
seven
do
you
forgive
your
brothers
yes
sir
if
they
repent
if
they
repent
yes
sir
if
they
repent
that
the
interpretation
in
matthew
you
will
find
he
repent
forgive
him
but
if
you
do
forgive
them
even
before
they
repent
i
said
are
you
harboring
enmity
no
sir
i
not
treasuring
up
enmity
i
only
refuse
to
forgive
them
i
looked
at
the
man
a
little
astonished
but
he
looked
so
sincere
and
earnest
that
i
could
not
help
smiling
how
do
you
reconcile
that
with
the
command
one
another
you
surely
ca
love
and
refuse
to
forgive
them
at
the
same
time
i
do
refuse
to
forgive
them
he
repeated
if
john
there
indicating
an
old
man
in
a
coat
who
happened
to
be
passing
through
the
store
at
the
time
should
do
me
a
wrong
i
do
care
what
it
was
how
great
or
how
vile
if
he
should
come
to
me
and
say
i
sorry
he
executed
a
flashing
oratorical
move
in
emphasis
and
throwing
back
his
head
exclaimed
it
gone
it
gone
there
ai
any
more
of
it
all
gone
i
stood
there
quite
dumbfounded
by
his
virility
as
the
air
vibrated
with
his
force
and
feeling
so
manifestly
was
his
reading
of
the
bible
colored
by
the
grief
of
his
own
heart
that
it
was
almost
painful
to
tangle
him
with
it
goodness
and
mercy
colored
all
his
ideas
except
in
relation
to
his
followers
those
who
had
formerly
been
his
friends
and
now
left
him
to
himself
do
you
still
visit
the
poor
and
the
afflicted
as
you
once
did
i
asked
him
once
i
rather
not
say
anything
about
that
he
replied
sternly
but
do
you
yes
sir
still
make
your
annual
new
year
round
yes
sir
well
you
get
your
reward
for
that
whatever
you
believe
i
had
my
reward
he
said
slowly
had
it
yes
sir
had
it
every
hand
that
been
lifted
to
receive
the
little
i
had
to
offer
has
been
my
reward
he
smiled
and
then
said
in
seemingly
the
most
untimely
way
i
remember
once
going
to
a
lonely
woman
here
on
new
year
day
and
taking
her
a
little
something
basket
of
grapes
or
fruit
of
some
kind
it
was
i
was
stopping
a
minute
never
stay
long
you
know
just
run
in
and
say
new
year
leave
what
i
have
and
get
out
and
so
said
morning
aunt
mary
morning
elihu
says
she
stay
long
aunt
mary
i
said
want
to
leave
you
these
happy
new
year
well
sir
you
know
i
was
just
turning
around
and
starting
when
she
caught
hold
of
my
sleeve
and
says
burridge
she
says
me
that
hand
and
do
you
know
before
i
knew
what
she
was
about
she
took
it
up
to
her
lips
and
kissed
it
yes
she
did
kissed
my
hand
now
he
said
drawing
himself
up
with
eyes
bright
with
intense
feeling
you
know
whether
i
had
my
reward
or
not
do
you
vanity
vanity
saith
the
sometimes
a
single
life
will
clearly
and
effectively
illustrate
a
period
hence
to
me
the
importance
of
this
one
i
first
met
x
at
a
time
when
american
financial
methods
and
american
finances
were
at
their
apex
of
daring
and
splendor
and
when
the
world
was
in
a
more
or
less
tolerant
mood
toward
their
grandiose
manners
and
achievements
it
was
the
golden
day
of
morgan
senior
belmont
harriman
sage
gates
brady
and
many
many
others
who
were
still
extant
and
ruling
distinctly
and
drastically
as
was
proved
by
the
panic
of
in
opposition
to
them
and
yet
imitating
their
methods
now
an
old
story
to
those
who
have
read
frenzied
finance
lawless
wealth
and
other
such
exposures
of
the
methods
which
produced
our
enormous
american
fortunes
were
such
younger
men
as
charles
morse
the
victim
of
the
panic
augustus
heinze
another
if
less
conspicuous
victim
of
the
same
panic
thomas
an
ambitious
young
millionaire
himself
born
to
money
david
sullivan
and
x
i
refuse
to
mention
his
name
because
he
is
still
alive
although
no
longer
conspicuous
and
anxious
perhaps
to
avoid
the
uncomfortable
glare
of
publicity
when
all
the
honors
and
comforts
which
made
it
endurable
in
the
first
place
are
absent
the
person
who
made
x
essentially
interesting
to
me
long
before
i
met
him
was
one
lucien
de
shay
a
pianist
and
voice
culturist
who
was
also
a
connoisseur
in
the
matters
of
rugs
hangings
paintings
and
furniture
things
in
which
x
was
just
then
most
intensely
interested
erecting
as
he
was
a
great
house
on
long
island
and
but
newly
blossoming
into
the
world
of
art
or
fashion
or
culture
or
show
those
various
things
which
the
american
always
wants
to
blossom
or
bloom
into
and
which
he
does
not
always
succeed
in
doing
de
shay
was
one
of
those
odd
natures
so
common
to
the
metropolis
half
artist
and
half
man
of
fashion
who
attach
themselves
so
readily
to
men
of
strength
and
wealth
often
as
advisors
and
counselors
in
all
matters
of
taste
social
form
and
social
progress
how
this
particular
person
was
rewarded
i
never
quite
knew
whether
in
cash
or
something
else
he
was
also
a
of
mine
furnishing
me
tips
and
material
of
one
sort
and
another
in
connection
with
the
various
publications
i
was
then
managing
as
it
turned
out
later
x
was
not
exactly
a
as
yet
merely
a
fledgling
although
the
possibilities
were
there
and
his
aims
and
ambitions
were
fast
nearing
a
practical
triumph
the
end
of
which
of
course
was
to
be
as
in
the
case
of
nearly
all
american
of
the
newer
and
quicker
order
bohemian
or
exotic
and
fleshly
rather
than
cultural
or
æsthetic
pleasure
although
the
latter
were
never
really
exactly
ignored
but
even
so
he
was
a
typical
in
the
showy
and
even
gaudy
sense
of
the
time
for
if
the
staid
and
conservative
and
socially
rich
have
the
great
houses
and
the
ease
and
the
luxury
of
paraphernalia
the
bohemian
rich
of
the
x
type
have
the
flare
recklessness
and
imagination
which
lend
to
their
spendings
and
flutterings
a
sparkle
and
a
shine
which
the
others
can
never
hope
to
match
said
this
friend
of
mine
to
me
one
day
listen
i
want
you
to
meet
this
man
x
you
will
like
him
he
is
fine
you
have
any
idea
what
a
fascinating
person
he
really
is
he
looks
like
a
russian
grand
duke
he
has
the
manners
and
the
tastes
of
a
medici
or
a
borgia
he
is
building
a
great
house
down
on
long
island
that
once
it
is
done
will
have
cost
him
five
or
six
hundred
thousand
it
worth
seeing
already
his
studio
here
in
the
c
studio
building
is
a
dream
it
thick
with
the
loveliest
kinds
of
things
i
helped
buy
them
myself
and
he
is
dull
he
wrote
a
book
at
twenty
which
is
not
bad
either
and
which
he
says
is
something
like
himself
he
has
read
your
book
sister
carrie
and
he
sympathizes
with
that
man
hurstwood
says
parts
of
it
remind
him
of
his
own
struggles
that
why
he
wants
to
meet
you
he
once
worked
on
the
newspapers
too
god
knows
how
he
is
making
his
money
but
i
know
how
he
is
spending
it
he
decided
to
live
and
he
doing
it
splendidly
it
wonderful
i
took
notice
although
i
had
never
even
heard
of
the
man
there
were
so
very
very
many
rich
men
in
america
later
i
heard
much
more
concerning
him
from
this
same
de
shay
once
he
had
been
so
far
down
in
the
scale
that
he
had
to
shine
shoes
for
a
living
once
he
had
walked
the
streets
of
new
york
in
the
snow
his
shoes
cracked
and
broken
no
overcoat
not
even
a
warm
suit
he
had
come
here
a
penniless
emigrant
from
russia
now
he
controlled
four
banks
one
trust
company
an
insurance
company
a
fire
insurance
company
a
great
real
estate
venture
somewhere
and
what
not
naturally
all
of
this
interested
me
greatly
when
are
we
indifferent
to
a
rise
from
nothing
to
something
at
de
shay
invitation
i
journeyed
up
to
x
studio
one
wednesday
afternoon
at
four
my
friend
having
telephoned
me
that
if
i
could
i
must
come
at
once
that
there
was
an
especially
interesting
crowd
already
assembled
in
the
rooms
that
i
would
meet
a
long
list
of
celebrities
two
or
three
opera
singers
of
repute
were
already
there
among
them
an
italian
singer
and
sorceress
of
great
beauty
a
veritable
queen
of
the
genus
adventuress
who
was
setting
the
town
by
the
ears
not
only
by
her
loveliness
but
her
voice
her
beauty
was
so
remarkable
that
the
sunday
papers
were
giving
full
pages
to
her
face
and
torso
alone
there
were
to
be
several
light
opera
and
stage
beauties
there
also
a
basso
profundo
to
sing
writers
artists
poets
i
went
the
place
and
the
crowd
literally
enthralled
me
it
was
so
gay
colorful
thrillful
the
host
and
the
guests
were
really
interesting
to
me
not
that
it
was
so
marvelous
as
a
studio
or
that
it
was
so
gorgeously
decorated
and
furnished
it
was
impressive
enough
in
that
way
but
that
it
was
so
gracefully
and
interestingly
representative
of
a
kind
of
comfort
disguised
as
elegance
the
man
had
everything
or
nearly
so
friends
advisors
servants
followers
a
somewhat
savage
and
sybaritic
nature
as
i
saw
at
once
was
here
disporting
itself
in
velvets
and
silks
the
iron
hand
of
power
if
it
was
power
was
being
most
gracefully
and
agreeably
disguised
as
the
more
or
less
flaccid
one
of
pleasure
and
friendship
my
host
was
not
visible
at
first
but
i
met
a
score
of
people
whom
i
knew
by
reputation
and
listened
to
clatter
and
chatter
of
the
most
approved
metropolitan
bohemian
character
the
italian
sorceress
was
there
her
gorgeous
chain
earrings
tinkling
mellifluously
as
she
nodded
and
gesticulated
de
shay
at
once
whispered
in
my
ear
that
she
was
x
very
latest
flame
and
an
expensive
one
too
you
should
see
what
he
buys
her
he
exclaimed
in
a
whisper
god
actresses
and
society
women
floated
here
and
there
in
dreams
of
afternoon
dresses
the
automobiles
outside
were
making
a
perfect
uproar
the
poets
and
writers
fascinated
me
with
their
praises
of
the
host
munificence
and
taste
at
a
glance
it
was
plain
to
me
that
he
had
managed
to
gather
about
him
the
very
element
it
would
be
most
interesting
to
gather
supposing
one
desired
to
be
idle
carefree
and
socially
and
intellectually
gay
if
america
ever
presented
a
smarter
i
never
saw
it
my
friend
de
shay
being
the
fidus
achates
of
the
host
had
the
power
to
reveal
the
inner
mysteries
of
this
place
to
me
and
on
one
or
two
occasions
when
there
were
not
so
many
present
and
while
the
others
were
chattering
in
the
various
rooms
library
and
so
forth
i
was
being
shown
the
kitchen
pantry
wine
cellar
and
also
various
secret
doors
and
passages
whereby
mine
host
by
pressing
a
flower
on
a
wall
or
a
spring
behind
a
picture
could
cause
a
door
to
fly
open
or
close
which
gave
entrance
to
or
from
a
room
or
passage
in
no
way
connected
with
the
others
save
by
another
secret
door
and
leading
always
to
a
private
exit
i
wondered
at
once
at
the
character
of
the
person
who
could
need
desire
or
value
this
a
secret
bedroom
for
instance
a
in
one
of
these
was
a
rather
severe
if
handsome
desk
and
a
steel
safe
and
two
chairs
no
more
a
very
bare
room
i
wondered
at
this
silent
and
rather
commercial
sanctum
in
the
center
of
this
of
gayety
no
trace
of
the
sound
of
which
seemed
to
penetrate
here
what
i
also
gained
was
a
sense
of
an
exotic
sybaritic
and
purely
pagan
mind
one
which
knew
little
of
the
conventions
of
the
world
and
cared
less
on
my
first
visit
as
i
was
leaving
i
was
introduced
to
the
host
just
within
his
picture
gallery
hung
with
many
fine
examples
of
the
dutch
and
spanish
schools
i
found
him
to
be
as
described
picturesque
and
handsome
even
though
somewhat
plump
phlegmatic
and
lethargic
yet
active
enough
he
was
above
the
average
in
height
well
built
florid
with
a
huge
round
handsome
head
curly
black
hair
keen
black
eyes
heavy
overhanging
eyebrows
full
red
lips
a
marked
chin
ornamented
by
a
goatee
in
any
costume
ball
he
would
have
made
an
excellent
bacchus
or
pan
he
appeared
to
have
the
free
easy
and
gracious
manner
of
those
who
have
known
much
of
life
and
have
achieved
in
part
at
least
their
desires
he
smiled
wished
to
know
if
i
had
met
all
the
guests
hoped
that
the
sideboard
had
not
escaped
me
that
i
had
enjoyed
the
singing
would
i
come
some
evening
when
there
was
no
crowd
or
better
yet
dine
with
him
and
my
friend
de
shay
whose
personality
appeared
to
be
about
as
agreeable
to
him
as
his
own
he
was
sorry
he
could
not
give
me
more
attention
now
interestingly
enough
and
from
the
first
i
was
impressed
with
this
man
not
because
of
his
wealth
i
knew
richer
men
but
because
of
a
something
about
him
which
suggested
dreams
romance
a
kind
of
sense
or
love
of
splendor
and
grandeur
which
one
does
not
often
encounter
among
the
really
wealthy
those
cracked
shoes
were
in
my
mind
i
suppose
he
seemed
to
live
among
great
things
but
in
no
niggardly
parsimonious
or
way
here
was
ease
largess
a
kind
of
lavishness
which
was
not
ostentation
but
which
seemed
rather
to
say
what
are
the
minute
expenses
of
living
and
pleasuring
as
contrasted
with
the
profits
of
skill
in
the
world
outside
he
suggested
the
huge
and
adventures
with
which
so
many
of
the
great
financiers
of
the
day
the
true
tigers
of
wall
street
were
connected
it
was
not
long
thereafter
that
i
was
once
more
invited
this
time
to
a
much
more
lavish
affair
and
something
much
more
sybaritic
in
its
tone
although
i
was
really
not
conscious
of
what
it
was
to
be
like
when
i
went
there
it
began
at
twelve
midnight
and
to
this
day
it
glitters
in
my
mind
as
among
the
few
really
barbaric
and
exotic
things
that
i
have
ever
witnessed
not
that
the
trappings
or
hangings
or
setting
were
so
outré
or
amazing
as
that
the
atmosphere
of
the
thing
itself
was
relaxed
bubbling
pagan
there
were
so
many
daring
and
seeking
people
there
the
thing
sang
and
was
talked
of
for
months
after
in
whispers
the
gayety
the
abandon
the
sheer
intoxication
mental
and
physical
i
never
saw
more
daring
costumes
so
many
really
beautiful
women
glitteringly
so
in
one
place
at
one
time
wonderful
specimens
of
exotic
and
in
the
main
fleshy
or
sensuous
femininity
there
was
among
other
things
as
i
recall
a
large
nickeled
on
wheels
packed
with
unopened
bottles
of
champagne
and
you
had
but
to
lift
a
hand
or
wink
an
eye
to
have
another
opened
for
you
alone
ever
over
and
over
and
the
tray
was
always
full
one
wall
of
the
farther
on
was
laden
with
delicate
novelties
in
the
way
of
food
a
string
quartette
played
for
the
dancers
in
the
there
were
a
dozen
corners
in
different
rooms
screened
with
banks
of
flowers
and
concealing
divans
the
dancing
and
singing
were
superb
individual
often
abandoned
in
character
as
was
the
conversation
as
the
morning
wore
on
for
it
did
not
begin
until
after
midnight
the
moods
of
all
were
either
so
mellowed
or
inflamed
as
to
make
intentions
hopes
dreams
the
most
secret
and
sybaritic
the
order
of
expression
one
was
permitted
to
see
human
nature
stripped
of
much
of
its
repression
and
daylight
reserve
or
cant
at
about
four
in
the
morning
came
the
engaged
dancers
quite
the
pièce
de
résistance
with
wreaths
about
heads
waists
and
arms
for
clothing
and
well
really
nothing
more
beyond
their
beautiful
figures
scattering
rose
leaves
or
favors
these
dancers
the
company
itself
finally
joined
single
file
at
first
pellmell
afterwards
artists
writers
poets
dancing
from
room
to
room
in
crude
bacchic
imitation
of
their
leaders
the
women
too
until
all
were
singing
parading
swaying
and
dancing
in
and
out
of
the
dozen
rooms
and
finally
liquor
and
food
affecting
them
i
suppose
many
fell
flat
unable
to
do
anything
thereafter
but
lie
upon
divans
or
in
corners
until
friends
assisted
them
elsewhere
to
taxis
finally
but
mine
host
as
i
recall
him
was
always
present
serene
sober
smiling
unaffected
bland
and
gracious
and
untiring
in
his
attention
he
was
there
to
keep
order
where
otherwise
there
would
have
been
none
i
mention
this
merely
to
indicate
the
character
of
a
long
series
of
such
events
which
covered
the
years
to
during
that
time
for
the
reason
that
i
have
first
given
his
curious
pleasure
in
my
company
i
was
part
and
parcel
of
a
dozen
such
more
or
less
vivid
affairs
and
pleasurings
which
stamped
on
my
mind
not
only
x
but
life
itself
the
possibilities
and
resources
of
luxury
where
taste
and
appetite
are
involved
the
dreams
of
grandeur
and
happiness
which
float
in
some
men
minds
and
which
work
out
to
a
wild
fruition
dreams
so
outré
and
so
splendid
that
only
the
tyrant
of
an
obedient
empire
with
all
the
resources
of
an
enslaved
and
obedient
people
could
indulge
with
safety
thus
once
i
remember
that
a
dozen
of
us
writers
and
artists
being
assembled
in
his
studio
in
new
york
one
friday
afternoon
for
the
mere
purpose
of
idling
and
drinking
he
seeming
to
have
nothing
better
to
do
for
the
time
being
he
suddenly
suggested
and
as
though
it
had
but
now
occurred
to
him
that
we
all
adjourn
to
his
country
house
on
long
island
which
was
not
yet
quite
finished
or
rather
furnished
but
which
was
in
a
sufficient
state
of
completion
to
permit
of
appropriate
entertainment
providing
the
necessaries
were
carried
out
there
with
us
as
i
came
to
think
of
this
afterward
i
decided
that
after
all
it
was
not
perhaps
so
unpremeditated
as
it
seemed
and
that
unconsciously
we
served
a
very
useful
purpose
there
was
work
to
do
suggestions
to
be
obtained
an
overseer
decorator
and
landscape
gardener
with
whom
consultations
were
absolutely
necessary
and
nothing
that
x
ever
did
was
without
its
element
of
calculation
why
not
make
a
gala
affair
of
a
rather
dreary
november
task
hence
at
any
rate
the
majority
of
us
forthwith
agreed
since
plainly
it
meant
an
outing
of
the
most
lavish
and
pleasing
nature
at
once
four
automobiles
were
pressed
into
service
three
from
his
own
garage
and
one
specially
engaged
elsewhere
there
was
some
telephoning
culinary
supplies
to
a
chef
in
charge
of
the
famous
restaurant
below
who
was
with
our
host
and
soon
some
baskets
of
food
were
produced
and
subsequently
the
four
cars
made
their
appearance
at
the
entryway
below
at
dusk
of
a
gray
cold
smoky
day
we
were
all
bundled
into
these
poets
playwrights
novelists
editors
he
professed
a
great
contempt
for
actors
and
forthwith
we
were
off
to
do
miles
between
and
seven
i
often
think
of
that
ride
the
atmosphere
of
it
and
what
it
told
of
our
host
point
of
view
he
was
always
so
grave
serene
watchful
yet
pleasant
and
decidedly
agreeable
gay
even
without
seeming
so
to
be
there
was
something
so
amazingly
warm
and
exotic
about
him
and
his
and
yet
at
the
same
time
something
so
cold
and
calculated
as
if
after
all
he
were
saying
to
himself
i
am
the
master
of
all
this
am
it
for
my
own
pleasure
i
felt
that
he
looked
upon
us
all
not
so
much
as
intimates
or
friends
as
rather
fine
birds
or
specimens
of
one
kind
and
another
well
qualified
to
help
him
with
art
and
social
ideas
if
nothing
more
hence
his
interest
in
us
also
in
his
estimation
no
doubt
we
reflected
some
slight
color
or
light
into
his
life
which
he
craved
we
had
done
things
too
nevertheless
in
his
own
estimation
he
was
the
master
the
can
grande
he
could
at
will
take
us
up
or
leave
us
out
or
so
he
thought
we
were
mere
toys
fine
feathers
artists
it
was
nice
to
take
us
around
have
us
with
him
smothered
in
a
great
richly
braided
fur
coat
and
fur
cap
he
looked
as
much
the
grand
duke
as
one
might
wish
but
i
liked
him
truly
and
what
a
delicious
evening
and
holiday
all
told
he
made
of
it
for
us
by
leaving
a
trail
of
frightened
horses
men
and
women
and
tearing
through
the
gloom
as
though
streets
were
his
private
i
myself
as
much
frightened
as
any
at
the
roaring
speed
of
the
cars
and
the
possibilities
of
the
road
we
arrived
at
seven
and
by
eight
were
seated
to
a
course
dinner
of
the
most
gratifying
character
there
was
no
heat
in
the
house
as
yet
but
from
somewhere
great
logs
had
been
obtained
and
now
blazed
in
the
large
fireplaces
there
was
no
electricity
as
yet
a
private
plant
was
being
installed
but
candles
and
lamps
blazed
in
lovely
groups
casting
a
soft
glow
over
the
great
rooms
one
room
lacked
a
door
but
an
immense
rug
took
its
place
there
were
rugs
hangings
and
paintings
in
profusion
many
of
them
as
yet
unhung
some
of
the
most
interesting
importations
of
furniture
and
statuary
were
still
in
the
cases
in
which
they
had
arrived
with
marks
of
ships
and
the
names
of
foreign
cities
upon
the
cases
scattered
about
the
great
and
library
were
enough
rugs
divans
and
chairs
as
well
as
musical
instruments
a
piano
among
others
to
give
the
place
an
air
of
completeness
and
luxury
the
walls
and
ceilings
had
already
been
decorated
in
a
most
florid
manner
i
must
say
outside
were
great
balconies
and
verandahs
commanding
as
the
following
morning
proved
a
very
splendid
view
of
a
very
bleak
sea
the
sand
dunes
the
distant
floor
of
the
sea
the
ships
upstairs
were
nine
suites
of
and
and
bath
the
basement
was
an
intricate
world
of
kitchen
pantry
furnace
wine
cellars
and
what
not
outside
was
a
tawny
waste
of
sand
held
together
in
places
in
the
form
of
hummocks
and
even
concealing
hills
by
grasses
that
night
because
it
was
windy
and
dull
and
bleak
we
stayed
inside
i
for
one
going
outside
only
long
enough
to
discover
that
there
were
great
wide
verandahs
of
concrete
about
the
house
fit
for
great
entertainments
in
themselves
and
near
at
hand
hummocks
of
sand
inside
all
was
warm
and
flaring
enough
the
wine
cellar
seemed
to
contain
all
that
one
might
reasonably
desire
our
host
once
out
here
was
most
gay
in
his
mood
he
was
most
pleasantly
interested
in
the
progress
of
his
new
home
although
not
intensely
so
he
seemed
to
have
lived
a
great
deal
and
to
be
making
the
best
of
everything
as
though
it
were
something
to
go
through
with
with
much
talking
on
the
part
of
us
all
the
evening
passed
swiftly
enough
some
of
the
men
could
play
and
sing
one
poet
recited
enchanting
bits
of
verse
for
our
inspection
certain
pieces
of
furniture
and
statuary
were
unpacked
and
displayed
a
bronze
faun
some
three
feet
in
height
for
one
thing
all
the
time
i
was
sensible
of
being
in
contact
with
some
one
who
was
really
in
touch
with
life
in
a
very
large
way
financially
and
otherwise
his
mind
seemed
to
be
busy
with
all
sorts
of
things
there
were
two
syrians
in
paris
he
said
who
owned
a
large
collection
of
rugs
suitable
for
an
exhibition
he
had
an
agent
who
was
trying
to
secure
the
best
of
them
for
his
new
home
de
shay
had
recently
introduced
him
to
a
certain
italian
count
who
had
a
great
house
in
italy
but
could
not
afford
its
upkeep
he
was
going
to
take
over
a
portion
of
its
furnishings
after
due
verification
of
course
did
i
know
the
paintings
of
monticelli
and
mancini
he
had
just
secured
excellent
examples
of
both
some
time
when
his
new
home
was
further
along
i
must
come
out
then
the
pictures
would
be
hung
the
statuary
and
furniture
in
place
he
would
get
up
a
party
for
a
select
group
the
talk
drifted
to
music
and
the
stage
at
once
i
saw
that
because
of
his
taste
wealth
and
skill
women
formed
a
large
and
yet
rather
portion
of
his
life
holding
about
as
much
relation
to
his
inner
life
as
do
the
concubines
of
an
asiatic
sultan
madame
of
the
earrings
as
i
learned
from
de
shay
was
a
source
of
great
expense
to
him
but
at
that
she
was
elusive
not
easily
to
be
come
at
the
stage
and
broadway
were
full
of
many
beauties
in
various
walks
of
life
many
of
whom
he
knew
or
to
whom
he
could
obtain
access
did
i
know
thus
and
so
and
one
i
tell
you
he
said
after
a
time
and
when
the
wine
glasses
had
been
refilled
a
number
of
times
we
must
give
a
party
out
here
some
time
something
extraordinary
a
real
one
de
shay
and
bielow
naming
another
artist
and
myself
must
think
it
out
i
know
three
different
dancers
and
he
began
to
enumerate
their
qualities
i
saw
plainly
that
even
though
women
played
a
minor
part
in
his
life
they
were
the
fringe
and
embroidery
to
his
success
and
power
at
one
we
went
to
our
rooms
having
touched
upon
most
of
the
themes
dear
to
metropolitan
lovers
of
life
and
art
the
next
morning
was
wonderful
glittering
if
windy
the
sea
sparkled
beyond
the
waste
of
sand
i
noted
anew
the
richness
of
the
furnishings
the
greatness
of
the
house
set
down
in
so
much
sand
and
facing
the
great
sea
it
was
wonderful
there
was
no
order
for
breakfast
we
came
down
as
we
chose
a
samovar
and
a
coffee
urn
were
alight
on
the
table
rolls
chops
anything
were
brought
on
order
possibly
because
i
was
one
of
the
first
about
my
host
singled
me
out
he
was
up
and
dressed
when
i
came
down
and
we
strolled
over
the
estate
to
see
what
we
should
see
curiously
although
i
had
seen
many
country
homes
of
pretension
and
even
luxury
i
never
saw
one
that
appealed
to
me
more
on
the
ground
of
promise
and
after
a
fashion
of
partial
fulfillment
it
was
so
unpretentiously
pretentious
so
really
grand
in
a
limited
and
yet
poetic
way
exteriorly
its
placement
on
a
rise
of
ground
commanding
that
vast
sweep
of
sea
and
sand
its
verandahs
so
very
wide
great
smooth
floors
of
red
concrete
bordered
with
stone
boxes
for
flowers
and
handsomely
designed
stone
benches
its
long
walks
and
drives
but
newly
begun
its
stretch
of
beach
say
a
half
mile
away
and
possibly
a
mile
and
a
half
long
to
be
left
as
he
remarked
au
naturel
driftwood
stones
and
all
struck
me
most
favorably
only
one
long
pier
for
visiting
yachts
was
to
be
built
and
a
certain
stretch
of
beach
not
over
three
hundred
feet
cleared
for
bath
houses
and
a
smooth
beach
on
one
spot
of
land
a
high
hummock
reaching
out
into
the
sea
had
already
been
erected
a
small
vantage
tower
open
at
the
bottom
for
shade
and
rest
benches
turning
in
a
circle
upon
a
concrete
floor
above
it
a
top
looking
more
like
a
small
bleak
lighthouse
than
anything
else
in
this
upper
portion
was
a
room
reached
by
small
spiral
concrete
stairs
i
could
not
help
noting
the
reserve
and
with
which
my
host
took
all
this
he
was
so
healthy
assured
interested
and
i
am
glad
to
say
not
exactly
at
least
he
did
not
impress
me
in
that
way
a
most
irritating
condition
plainly
he
was
building
a
very
splendid
thing
his
life
was
nearing
its
apex
he
must
not
only
have
had
millions
but
great
taste
to
have
undertaken
let
alone
accomplished
as
much
as
was
already
visible
here
pointing
to
a
bleak
waste
of
sand
between
the
house
and
the
sea
and
it
looked
like
a
huge
red
and
yellow
bird
perched
upon
a
waste
of
sand
he
observed
when
you
come
again
in
the
spring
that
will
contain
a
garden
of
roses
the
wind
is
nearly
always
off
the
sea
here
i
want
the
perfume
to
blow
over
the
verandahs
i
can
rotate
the
roses
so
that
a
big
percentage
of
them
will
always
be
in
bloom
we
visited
the
stables
the
garage
an
artesian
well
newly
driven
a
drive
that
was
to
skirt
the
sea
a
sunken
garden
some
distance
from
the
house
and
away
from
the
sea
next
spring
i
came
once
more
several
times
in
fact
the
rose
garden
was
then
in
bloom
the
drives
finished
the
pictures
hung
although
this
was
not
a
world
in
which
society
as
yet
deigned
to
move
it
was
entirely
conceivable
that
at
a
later
period
it
might
and
betimes
it
was
crowded
with
people
smart
enough
and
more
agreeable
in
the
main
than
the
hardy
strident
members
of
the
really
inner
circles
there
were
artists
writers
playwrights
singers
actresses
and
some
nondescript
figures
of
the
world
young
men
principally
who
seemed
to
come
here
in
connection
with
beautiful
young
women
models
and
other
girls
whose
beauty
was
their
only
recommendation
to
consideration
the
scene
was
not
without
brilliance
a
butler
and
numerous
flunkeys
fluttered
to
and
fro
guests
were
received
at
the
door
by
a
footman
a
housekeeper
and
various
maids
governed
in
the
matter
of
cleaning
one
could
play
golf
tennis
bridge
motor
fish
swim
drink
in
a
free
and
even
disconcerting
manner
or
read
quietly
in
one
angle
or
another
of
the
grounds
there
were
affairs
much
flirting
and
giggling
suspicious
wanderings
to
and
fro
at
night
no
questions
asked
as
to
who
came
or
whether
one
was
married
so
long
as
a
reasonable
amount
of
decorum
was
maintained
it
was
the
same
on
other
occasions
only
the
house
and
grounds
were
full
to
overflowing
with
guests
and
passing
friends
whose
machines
barked
in
the
drives
i
saw
as
many
gay
and
fascinating
costumes
and
heard
as
much
clever
and
at
times
informative
talk
here
as
anywhere
i
have
been
during
this
fall
and
winter
i
was
engaged
in
work
which
kept
me
very
much
to
myself
during
the
period
i
read
much
of
x
banks
he
was
combining
new
ventures
he
was
undertaking
yet
all
at
once
one
day
and
out
of
a
clear
sky
the
papers
were
full
of
an
enormous
financial
crash
of
which
he
was
the
center
according
to
the
newspapers
the
first
and
foremost
of
a
chain
of
banks
of
which
he
was
the
head
to
say
nothing
of
a
bonding
and
realty
company
and
some
project
on
long
island
were
all
involved
in
the
crash
curiously
although
no
derogatory
mention
had
previously
been
made
of
him
the
articles
and
editorials
were
now
most
vituperative
their
venom
was
especially
noticeable
he
was
a
villain
of
the
vilest
stripe
he
had
been
juggling
a
bank
a
trust
company
an
insurance
company
and
a
land
and
speculative
scheme
as
one
would
glass
balls
the
money
wherewith
he
gambled
was
not
his
he
had
robbed
the
poor
deceived
them
yet
among
all
this
and
in
the
huge
articles
which
appeared
the
very
first
day
i
noted
one
paragraph
which
stuck
in
my
mind
for
i
was
naturally
interested
in
all
this
and
in
him
it
read
wall
street
heard
yesterday
that
superintendent
h
got
his
first
information
concerning
the
state
in
which
x
affairs
were
from
quarters
where
resentment
may
have
been
cherished
because
of
his
activity
in
the
long
island
traction
field
this
is
one
of
the
street
patches
and
the
success
which
the
newcomer
seemed
to
be
meeting
did
not
provoke
great
pleasure
another
item
read
a
hitch
in
a
deal
that
was
to
have
transferred
the
south
shore
to
the
new
york
and
queens
county
system
owned
by
the
long
island
railroad
at
a
profit
of
almost
to
x
was
the
cause
of
all
the
trouble
very
active
displeasure
on
the
part
of
certain
powers
in
wall
street
blocked
it
is
said
the
closing
of
the
deal
for
the
railroad
they
did
not
want
him
in
this
field
and
were
powerful
enough
to
prevent
it
at
the
same
time
pressure
from
other
directions
was
brought
to
bear
on
him
the
refused
to
clear
for
his
banks
x
was
in
need
of
cash
but
still
insisting
on
a
high
rate
of
remuneration
for
the
road
which
he
had
developed
to
an
important
point
their
sinister
influences
entered
and
blocked
the
transfer
until
it
was
no
longer
possible
for
him
to
hold
out
along
with
these
two
items
was
a
vast
mass
of
data
really
pages
showing
how
when
where
he
had
done
thus
and
so
juggled
accounts
between
one
bank
and
another
all
of
which
he
controlled
however
and
most
of
which
he
owned
drew
out
large
sums
and
put
in
their
place
mortgages
on
or
securities
in
new
companies
which
he
was
organizing
tricks
which
were
the
ordinary
routine
of
wall
street
and
hence
rather
ridiculous
as
the
of
so
vast
a
hue
and
cry
i
was
puzzled
and
more
than
that
moved
by
the
drama
of
the
sudden
end
for
i
understood
a
little
of
finance
and
its
ways
also
of
what
place
and
power
had
plainly
come
to
mean
to
him
it
must
be
dreadful
yet
how
could
it
be
i
asked
myself
if
he
really
owned
per
cent
or
more
in
so
many
companies
that
he
could
be
such
a
dark
villain
after
all
ownership
is
ownership
and
control
control
on
the
face
of
the
reports
themselves
his
schemes
did
not
look
so
black
i
read
everything
in
connection
with
him
with
care
as
the
days
passed
various
other
things
happened
for
one
thing
he
tried
to
commit
suicide
by
jumping
out
of
a
window
of
his
studio
in
new
york
for
another
he
tried
to
take
poison
now
of
a
sudden
a
bachelor
sister
of
whom
i
had
never
heard
in
all
the
time
i
had
known
him
put
in
an
appearance
as
his
nearest
of
kin
a
woman
whose
name
was
not
his
own
but
a
variation
of
it
an
having
suddenly
been
tacked
onto
it
she
took
him
to
a
sanitarium
from
which
he
was
eventually
turned
out
as
a
criminal
then
to
a
hospital
until
finally
he
surrendered
himself
to
the
police
the
names
of
great
lawyers
and
other
bankers
began
to
enter
the
case
alienists
of
repute
those
fine
chameleons
of
the
legal
world
were
employed
who
swore
first
that
he
was
insane
then
that
he
was
not
his
sister
who
was
a
physician
and
scientist
of
repute
asked
the
transfer
of
all
his
property
to
her
on
the
ground
that
he
was
incompetent
and
that
she
was
his
next
of
kin
to
this
she
swore
giving
as
her
reasons
for
believing
him
insane
that
he
had
illusions
of
grandeur
and
that
he
believed
himself
persecuted
by
eminent
financiers
things
which
smacked
more
of
sanity
than
anything
else
to
me
at
the
same
time
he
and
she
as
time
rather
indicated
had
arranged
this
in
part
in
the
hope
of
saving
something
out
of
the
great
wreck
there
were
other
curious
features
certain
eminent
men
in
politics
and
finance
who
from
revelations
made
by
the
books
of
the
various
banks
were
in
close
financial
if
not
personal
relations
with
x
denied
this
completely
curiously
the
great
cry
on
the
part
of
these
was
that
he
was
insane
must
be
and
that
he
was
all
alone
in
his
schemes
his
life
on
broadway
on
long
island
in
his
studio
in
new
york
were
ransacked
for
details
enough
could
not
be
made
of
his
gay
shameful
spendthrift
life
no
one
else
of
course
had
ever
been
either
gay
or
shameful
before
especially
not
the
eminent
and
hounding
financiers
then
from
somewhere
appeared
a
new
element
in
a
staggeringly
low
tenement
region
in
brooklyn
was
discovered
somehow
or
other
a
very
old
man
and
woman
most
unsatisfactory
as
relatives
of
such
imposing
people
who
insisted
that
they
were
his
parents
that
years
before
because
he
and
his
sister
were
exceedingly
restless
and
ambitious
they
had
left
them
and
had
only
returned
occasionally
to
borrow
money
finally
ceasing
to
come
at
all
in
proof
of
this
letters
witnesses
old
photos
were
produced
it
really
did
appear
as
if
he
and
his
sister
although
they
had
long
vigorously
denied
it
really
were
the
son
and
daughter
of
the
two
who
had
been
petty
bakers
in
brooklyn
laying
up
a
little
competence
of
their
own
i
never
knew
who
dug
them
up
but
the
reason
why
was
plain
enough
the
sister
was
laying
claim
to
the
property
as
the
next
of
kin
if
this
could
be
offset
even
though
x
were
insane
the
property
would
at
once
be
thrown
into
the
hands
of
the
various
creditors
and
sold
under
a
forced
sale
of
course
in
other
words
for
a
song
for
their
benefit
naturally
it
was
of
interest
to
those
who
wished
to
have
his
affairs
wound
up
to
have
the
old
people
produced
but
the
great
financier
had
been
spreading
the
report
all
along
that
he
was
from
russia
that
his
parents
or
were
still
there
but
that
really
he
was
the
illegitimate
son
of
the
czar
of
russia
boarded
out
originally
with
a
poor
family
now
however
the
old
people
were
brought
from
brooklyn
and
compelled
to
confront
him
it
was
never
really
proved
that
he
and
his
sister
had
neglected
them
utterly
or
had
done
anything
to
seriously
injure
them
but
rather
that
as
they
had
grown
in
place
and
station
they
had
become
more
or
less
estranged
and
so
ignored
them
having
changed
their
names
and
soared
in
a
world
little
dreamed
of
by
their
parents
also
a
perjury
charge
was
made
against
the
sister
which
effectually
prevented
her
from
controlling
his
estate
a
lease
long
enough
to
give
the
financiers
time
for
their
work
naturally
there
was
a
great
hue
and
cry
over
her
the
scandal
the
shame
that
they
should
thus
publicly
refuse
to
recognize
their
parents
as
they
did
or
had
when
confronted
by
them
horrible
there
were
most
heavily
illustrated
and
tearful
sunday
articles
all
blazoned
forth
with
pictures
of
his
house
and
studio
his
banks
cars
yacht
groups
of
guests
while
the
motives
of
those
who
produced
the
parents
were
overlooked
the
pictures
of
the
parents
confronting
x
and
his
sister
portrayed
very
old
and
feeble
people
and
were
rather
moving
they
insisted
that
they
were
his
parents
and
wept
brokenly
in
their
hands
but
why
and
he
denying
it
his
sister
who
resented
all
this
bitterly
and
who
stood
by
him
valiantly
repudiated
for
his
sake
of
course
his
and
her
parents
and
friends
i
never
saw
such
a
running
to
cover
of
friends
in
all
my
life
of
all
those
i
had
seen
about
his
place
and
in
his
company
scores
on
scores
of
people
reasonably
well
known
in
the
arts
the
stage
the
worlds
of
finance
and
music
all
eating
his
dinners
riding
in
his
cars
drinking
his
wines
there
was
scarcely
any
one
now
who
knew
him
anything
more
than
casually
or
slightly
oh
so
slightly
when
rumors
as
to
the
midnight
suppers
the
bacchic
dancing
the
automobile
parties
to
his
great
country
place
and
the
spirited
frolics
which
occurred
there
began
to
get
abroad
there
was
no
one
whom
i
knew
who
had
ever
been
there
or
knew
anything
about
him
or
them
for
instance
of
all
the
people
who
had
been
close
or
closest
and
might
therefore
have
been
expected
to
be
friendly
and
deeply
concerned
was
de
shay
his
fidus
achates
and
literally
his
pensioner
yet
de
shay
was
almost
the
loudest
in
his
denunciation
or
at
least
deprecation
of
x
his
habits
and
methods
although
it
was
he
who
had
told
me
of
mme
and
her
relation
to
x
who
urged
me
to
come
here
there
and
the
other
place
especially
where
x
was
the
host
always
assuring
me
that
it
would
be
so
wonderful
and
that
x
was
really
such
a
great
man
so
generous
so
he
was
now
really
the
loudest
or
at
least
the
most
in
his
comments
pretending
never
to
have
been
very
close
to
x
and
lifting
his
eyebrows
in
astonishment
as
though
he
had
not
even
guessed
what
he
had
actually
engineered
his
and
would
have
done
credit
to
a
he
was
so
shocked
especially
at
x
robbing
poor
children
and
orphans
although
in
so
far
as
my
reading
of
the
papers
went
i
could
find
nothing
that
went
to
prove
that
he
had
any
intention
of
robbing
anybody
that
is
directly
in
the
usual
wall
street
high
finance
style
he
was
robbing
peter
to
pay
paul
that
is
he
was
using
the
monies
of
one
corporation
which
he
controlled
to
bolster
up
any
of
the
others
which
he
controlled
and
was
washing
one
hand
with
the
other
a
proceeding
so
common
in
finance
that
to
really
radically
and
truly
oppose
it
or
do
away
with
it
would
mean
to
bring
down
the
whole
fabric
of
finance
in
one
grand
crash
be
that
as
it
may
in
swift
succession
there
now
followed
the
legal
seizure
and
confiscation
of
all
his
properties
in
the
first
place
by
alienists
representing
the
district
attorney
and
the
state
banking
department
he
was
declared
sane
and
placed
on
trial
for
embezzlement
secondly
his
sister
plea
that
his
property
be
put
into
her
hands
as
trustee
or
administrator
was
thrown
out
of
court
and
she
herself
arrested
and
confined
for
perjury
on
the
ground
that
she
had
perjured
herself
in
swearing
that
she
was
his
next
of
kin
when
in
reality
his
real
parents
or
so
they
swore
were
alive
and
in
america
next
his
banks
trust
companies
and
various
concerns
including
his
great
country
estate
were
swiftly
thrown
into
the
hands
of
receivers
what
an
appropriate
name
and
wound
up
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
all
the
while
x
was
in
prison
protesting
that
he
was
really
not
guilty
that
he
was
solvent
or
had
been
until
he
was
attacked
by
the
state
bank
examiner
or
the
department
back
of
him
and
that
he
was
the
victim
of
a
conspiracy
which
was
using
the
state
banking
department
and
other
means
to
drive
him
out
of
financial
life
and
that
solely
because
of
his
desire
to
grow
and
because
by
chance
he
had
been
impinging
upon
one
of
the
choicest
and
most
closely
guarded
fields
of
the
of
wall
street
the
street
railway
area
in
new
york
and
brooklyn
one
day
so
he
publicly
swore
to
the
grand
jury
by
which
he
was
being
examined
as
he
was
sitting
in
his
great
offices
in
one
of
the
great
of
new
york
which
occupied
an
entire
floor
and
commanded
vast
panoramas
in
every
direction
another
evidence
of
the
man
insane
delusion
of
grandeur
i
presume
he
was
called
to
answer
the
telephone
one
y
so
his
assistant
said
one
of
the
eminent
financiers
of
wall
street
and
america
was
on
the
wire
without
any
preliminary
and
merely
asking
was
this
x
on
the
wire
the
latter
proceeded
this
is
y
listen
closely
to
what
i
am
going
to
say
i
want
you
to
get
out
of
the
street
railway
business
in
new
york
or
something
is
going
to
happen
to
you
i
am
giving
you
a
reasonable
warning
take
it
then
the
phone
clicked
most
savagely
and
ominously
and
superiorly
at
the
other
end
i
knew
at
the
time
went
on
x
addressing
the
grand
jury
that
i
was
really
listening
to
the
man
who
was
most
powerful
in
such
affairs
in
new
york
and
elsewhere
and
that
he
meant
what
he
said
at
the
same
time
i
was
in
no
position
to
get
out
without
closing
up
the
one
deal
which
stood
to
net
me
two
million
dollars
clear
if
i
closed
it
at
the
same
time
i
wanted
to
enter
this
field
and
did
see
why
i
should
if
i
did
it
spelled
not
ruin
by
any
means
but
a
considerable
loss
a
very
great
loss
to
me
in
more
ways
than
one
oddly
enough
just
at
this
time
i
was
being
pressed
by
those
with
whom
i
was
associated
to
wind
up
this
particular
venture
and
turn
my
attention
to
other
things
i
have
often
wondered
in
the
light
of
their
subsequent
actions
why
they
should
have
become
so
pressing
just
at
this
time
at
the
same
time
perhaps
i
was
a
little
vain
and
i
had
once
got
the
better
of
some
agents
of
another
great
financier
in
a
western
power
deal
and
i
felt
that
i
could
put
this
thing
through
too
hence
i
refused
to
heed
the
warning
however
i
found
that
all
those
who
were
previously
interested
to
buy
or
at
least
develop
the
property
were
now
suddenly
grown
cold
and
a
little
later
when
having
entered
on
several
other
matters
i
needed
considerable
cash
the
state
banking
department
descended
on
me
and
crying
fraud
and
insolvency
closed
all
my
banks
you
know
how
it
is
when
they
do
this
to
you
cry
and
you
can
nearly
wreck
a
perfectly
good
theater
building
depositors
withdraw
securities
tumble
investigation
and
legal
expenses
begin
your
financial
associates
get
frightened
or
ashamed
and
desert
you
nothing
is
so
squeamish
or
so
retiring
and
nervous
as
money
time
will
show
that
i
was
not
insolvent
at
the
time
the
books
will
show
a
few
technically
illegal
things
but
so
would
the
books
or
the
affairs
of
any
great
bank
especially
at
this
time
if
quickly
examined
i
was
doing
no
more
than
all
were
doing
but
they
wanted
to
get
me
out
and
they
did
regardless
of
proceedings
of
various
kinds
legal
technical
and
the
like
x
was
finally
sent
to
the
penitentiary
and
spent
some
time
there
at
the
same
time
his
confession
finally
wrecked
about
nine
other
eminent
men
financiers
all
a
dispassionate
examination
of
all
the
evidence
eight
years
later
caused
me
to
conclude
without
hesitation
that
the
man
had
been
a
victim
of
a
conspiracy
the
object
of
which
was
to
oust
him
from
opportunities
and
to
forestall
him
in
methods
which
would
certainly
have
led
to
enormous
wealth
he
was
apparently
in
a
position
and
with
the
brains
to
do
many
of
the
things
which
the
ablest
and
coldest
financiers
of
his
day
had
been
and
were
doing
and
they
did
not
want
to
be
bothered
with
would
not
brook
in
short
his
approaching
rivalry
like
the
various
usurpers
of
regal
powers
in
ancient
days
they
thought
it
best
to
kill
a
possible
claimant
to
the
throne
in
his
infancy
but
that
youth
of
his
the
long
and
devious
path
by
which
he
had
come
among
the
papers
relating
to
the
case
and
to
a
time
when
he
could
not
have
been
more
than
eighteen
and
when
he
was
beginning
his
career
as
a
book
agent
was
a
letter
written
to
his
mother
august
which
read

your
son
there
was
another
bit
of
testimony
on
the
part
of
one
henry
dom
a
baker
who
for
some
strange
reason
came
forward
to
identify
him
as
some
one
he
had
known
years
before
in
williamsburgh
which
read
i
easily
recognize
them
x
and
his
sister
from
their
pictures
in
the
newspapers
i
worked
for
x
father
who
was
a
baker
in
williamsburgh
and
frequently
addressed
letters
that
were
written
by
x
senior
and
his
wife
to
louise
x
who
was
then
studying
medicine
in
philadelphia
x
was
then
a
boy
going
to
school
but
working
in
his
father
bakery
mornings
and
evenings
he
did
not
want
to
do
that
moaned
a
great
deal
and
his
parents
humored
him
in
his
attitude
he
was
very
vain
liked
to
appear
intellectual
they
kept
saying
to
their
friends
that
he
should
have
a
fine
future
five
years
later
after
i
had
left
them
once
i
met
the
mother
and
she
told
me
that
x
was
studying
banking
and
getting
along
fine
some
seven
years
after
the
failure
and
trial
by
which
he
had
so
summarily
been
disposed
of
and
after
he
had
been
released
from
prison
i
was
standing
at
a
certain
unimportant
street
corner
in
new
york
waiting
for
a
car
when
i
saw
him
he
was
passing
in
the
opposite
direction
not
very
briskly
and
as
i
saw
plainly
meditatively
he
was
not
so
well
dressed
the
clothes
he
wore
while
good
were
somehow
different
lacking
in
that
exquisite
something
which
had
characterized
him
years
before
his
hat
well
it
was
a
hat
not
a
romanoff
shako
nor
a
handsome
panama
such
as
he
had
affected
in
the
old
days
he
looked
tired
a
little
worn
and
dusty
i
thought
my
first
impulse
was
of
course
to
hail
him
my
second
not
since
he
had
not
seen
me
it
might
have
been
embarrassing
and
at
any
rate
he
might
not
have
even
remembered
me
but
as
he
walked
i
thought
of
the
great
house
by
the
sea
the
studio
the
cars
the
roses
the
crowds
at
his
summer
place
the
receptions
in
town
and
out
madame
of
the
earrings
afterward
married
to
a
french
nobleman
and
then
of
the
letter
to
his
mother
as
a
boy
the
broken
shoes
in
the
winter
time
his
denial
of
his
parents
the
telephone
message
from
the
financial
tiger
vanity
vanity
saith
the
preacher
the
shores
of
our
social
seas
are
strewn
with
pathetic
wrecks
the
whitening
bone
of
ships
at
the
next
corner
he
paused
a
little
uncertain
apparently
as
to
which
way
to
go
then
turned
to
the
left
and
was
lost
i
have
never
seen
nor
heard
of
him
since
mighty
when
i
first
met
him
he
was
laying
the
foundation
for
a
small
dynamo
in
the
of
the
repair
shop
at
spike
and
he
was
most
unusually
loud
in
his
protestations
and
demands
he
had
with
him
a
dozen
italians
all
short
swarthy
fellows
of
from
to
fifty
years
of
age
who
were
busy
bringing
material
from
a
car
that
had
been
pushed
in
on
the
next
to
the
building
this
was
loaded
with
crushed
stone
cement
old
boards
wheelbarrows
tools
and
the
like
all
of
which
were
to
be
used
in
the
labor
that
he
was
about
to
undertake
he
himself
was
standing
in
the
doorway
of
the
shop
where
the
work
was
to
be
conducted
coat
off
sleeves
rolled
up
and
shouting
with
true
irish
insistence
come
matt
come
jimmie
get
the
shovels
now
get
the
picks
bring
some
sand
here
bring
some
stone
where
the
cement
now
where
the
cement
jasus
christ
i
must
have
some
cement
what
arre
ye
all
doin
what
do
ye
think
ye
up
here
fer
hurry
now
hurry
bring
the
cement
and
then
having
concluded
this
amazing
fanfare
calmly
turning
to
gaze
about
as
if
he
were
the
only
one
in
the
world
who
had
the
right
to
stand
still
more
or
less
oppressed
with
life
myself
at
the
time
i
was
against
all
bosses
and
particularly
against
so
seemingly
a
vicious
one
as
this
what
a
slave
driver
i
thought
what
a
brute
and
yet
i
remember
thinking
that
he
was
not
exactly
unpleasant
to
look
at
either
quite
the
contrary
he
was
medium
in
height
thick
of
body
and
neck
with
short
gray
hair
and
mustache
and
bright
clear
twinkling
irish
gray
eyes
and
he
carried
himself
with
an
air
of
unquestionable
authority
it
was
much
as
if
he
had
said
i
am
the
boss
here
and
indeed
he
was
is
it
this
that
sends
the
irish
to
rule
as
captains
of
hundreds
the
world
over
the
job
he
was
bossing
was
not
very
intricate
or
important
but
it
was
interesting
it
consisted
of
digging
a
trench
ten
by
twelve
feet
and
shaping
it
up
with
boards
into
a
form
after
which
concrete
was
to
be
mixed
and
poured
in
and
some
iron
rods
set
to
fasten
the
engine
to
an
engine
bed
no
less
it
was
not
so
urgent
but
that
it
might
have
been
conducted
with
far
less
excitement
but
what
are
you
to
do
when
you
are
naturally
excitable
love
to
make
a
great
noise
and
feel
that
things
are
going
forward
whether
they
are
or
not
plainly
this
particular
individual
loved
noise
and
a
great
stir
so
eager
was
he
to
have
done
with
it
no
matter
what
it
was
or
where
that
he
was
constantly
trotting
to
and
fro
shouting
come
matt
come
jimmie
hurry
now
bring
the
shovels
bring
the
picks
and
occasionally
bursting
forth
with
a
perfect
avalanche
of
orders
up
with
it
down
with
it
front
with
it
back
with
it
in
with
it
out
with
it
all
coupled
with
his
favorite
expletive
jasus
christ
which
was
as
innocent
of
evil
i
subsequently
came
to
know
as
a
prayer
in
short
he
was
simply
wild
irish
and
that
was
all
there
was
to
him
a
delightful
specimen
like
namgay
doola
but
as
i
say
at
the
time
he
seemed
positively
appalling
to
me
a
virulent
specimen
and
i
thought
the
irish
brute
to
think
of
human
beings
having
to
work
for
a
brute
like
that
to
think
of
his
driving
men
like
that
however
i
soon
began
to
discover
that
he
was
not
so
bad
as
he
seemed
and
then
i
began
to
like
him
the
thing
that
brought
about
this
swift
change
of
feeling
in
me
was
the
attitude
of
his
men
toward
him
although
he
was
so
insistent
with
his
commands
they
did
not
seem
to
mind
nor
to
strain
themselves
working
they
were
not
killing
themselves
by
any
means
he
would
stand
over
them
crying
up
with
it
up
with
it
up
with
it
up
with
it
or
down
with
it
down
with
it
down
with
it
until
you
would
have
imagined
their
nerves
would
be
worn
to
a
frazzle
as
it
was
however
they
did
not
seem
to
care
any
more
than
you
would
for
the
ticking
of
a
clock
rather
they
appeared
to
take
it
as
a
matter
of
course
something
that
had
to
be
and
that
one
was
prepared
for
their
steps
were
in
the
main
as
leisurely
as
those
of
idlers
on
fifth
avenue
or
broadway
they
carried
boards
or
stone
as
one
would
objects
of
great
value
one
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
incongruity
of
it
it
was
farcical
finally
gathering
the
full
import
of
it
all
i
ventured
to
laugh
and
he
turned
on
me
with
a
sharp
and
yet
not
unkindly
retort
ha
ha
ha
he
mocked
if
ye
had
to
work
as
hard
as
these
min
ye
would
laugh
i
wanted
to
say
hard
work
indeed
but
instead
i
replied
is
that
so
well
i
do
see
that
they
killing
themselves
or
you
either
you
not
as
fierce
as
you
sound
then
i
explained
that
i
was
not
laughing
at
them
but
at
him
and
he
took
it
all
in
good
part
since
i
was
only
a
nominal
laborer
here
not
a
real
one
permitted
to
work
for
my
health
for
twelve
cents
an
hour
we
fell
to
conversing
upon
railroad
matters
and
in
this
way
our
period
of
friendship
began
as
i
learned
that
morning
rourke
was
the
for
minor
tasks
for
all
that
part
of
the
railroad
that
lay
between
new
york
and
fifty
miles
out
on
three
divisions
he
had
a
dozen
or
so
men
under
him
and
was
in
possession
of
one
car
which
was
shunted
back
and
forth
between
the
places
in
which
he
happened
to
be
working
he
was
a
builder
of
concrete
platforms
culverts
sidewalks
bridge
and
building
piers
and
in
fact
anything
that
could
be
made
out
of
crushed
stone
and
cement
or
bricks
and
stone
and
he
was
sent
here
and
there
as
necessity
required
as
he
explained
to
me
at
the
time
he
sometimes
rose
as
early
as
four
in
order
to
get
to
his
place
of
labor
by
seven
the
great
railroad
company
for
which
he
toiled
was
no
gentle
master
and
did
not
look
upon
his
ease
or
that
of
his
men
as
important
at
the
same
time
as
he
himself
confessed
he
did
not
mind
hard
work
liked
it
in
short
he
had
been
working
now
for
the
company
for
all
of
years
rain
or
shine
darkness
or
storm
made
no
difference
to
him
shewer
i
have
to
be
there
he
observed
once
with
his
quizzical
elusive
irish
grin
they
not
payin
me
wages
fer
lyin
in
bed
if
ye
was
to
get
up
that
way
yerself
every
day
fer
a
year
me
he
added
eyeing
my
spare
and
none
too
well
articulated
frame
it
make
a
man
av
ye
yes
i
said
tolerantly
and
how
much
do
you
get
rourke
two
an
a
half
a
day
you
do
say
i
replied
pretending
admiration
the
munificence
of
the
corporation
that
paid
him
two
and
a
half
dollars
a
day
for
ten
hours
work
as
well
as
for
superintending
and
constructing
things
of
such
importance
struck
me
forcibly
perhaps
as
we
say
in
america
he
had
a
right
to
be
happy
only
i
could
not
see
it
at
the
same
time
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
he
was
better
situated
than
myself
at
the
time
i
had
been
ill
and
was
now
earning
only
twelve
cents
an
hour
for
ten
hours
work
and
the
sight
of
the
foreman
for
whom
i
was
working
was
a
torture
to
my
soul
he
was
such
a
blustering
ignoramus
and
i
wanted
to
get
out
from
under
him
at
the
same
time
i
was
not
without
sufficient
influence
so
to
do
providing
i
could
find
a
foreman
who
could
make
use
of
me
the
great
thing
was
to
do
this
and
the
more
i
eyed
this
particular
specimen
of
foreman
the
better
i
liked
him
he
was
genial
really
kindly
amazingly
simple
and
sincere
i
decided
to
appeal
to
him
to
take
me
on
his
staff
how
would
you
like
to
take
me
rourke
and
let
me
work
for
you
i
asked
hopefully
after
explaining
to
him
why
i
was
here
shewer
he
replied
ye
do
fine
would
i
have
to
work
with
the
italians
i
asked
wondering
how
i
would
make
out
with
a
pick
and
shovel
my
frame
was
so
spare
at
the
time
that
the
question
must
have
amused
him
considering
the
type
of
physique
required
for
day
labor
there
be
plenty
av
work
fer
ye
to
do
without
ever
yer
layin
a
hand
to
a
pick
er
shovel
he
replied
comfortingly
shewer
that
no
work
fer
white
min
let
the
nagurs
do
it
look
at
their
backs
an
arrms
then
look
at
yers
i
was
ready
to
blush
for
shame
these
poor
italians
whom
i
was
so
ready
to
contemn
were
immeasurably
my
physical
superiors
but
why
do
you
call
them
negroes
rourke
i
asked
after
a
time
they
not
black
well
bedad
they
not
white
that
waan
thing
shewer
he
added
aany
man
can
tell
that
be
lookin
at
thim
i
had
to
smile
it
was
so
dogmatic
and
unreasoning
very
well
then
they
black
i
said
and
we
left
the
matter
not
long
after
i
put
in
a
plea
to
be
transferred
to
him
at
his
request
and
it
was
granted
the
day
that
i
joined
his
flock
or
gang
as
he
called
it
he
was
at
williamsbridge
a
little
station
north
on
the
harlem
building
a
concrete
it
was
a
pretty
place
surrounded
by
trees
and
a
a
vast
improvement
upon
a
dark
indoor
shop
and
seemed
to
me
a
veritable
haven
of
rest
ah
the
smiling
morning
sun
the
green
leaves
the
gentle
fresh
winds
of
heaven
rourke
was
down
in
an
earthen
excavation
under
the
depot
platform
when
i
arrived
measuring
and
calculating
with
his
and
level
and
when
i
looked
in
on
him
hopefully
he
looked
up
and
smiled
so
here
ye
arre
at
last
he
said
with
a
grin
yes
i
laughed
well
ye
jist
in
time
i
waant
ye
to
go
down
to
the
ahffice
certainly
i
replied
but
before
i
could
say
more
he
climbed
out
of
his
hole
his
white
jeans
odorous
of
the
earth
and
fished
in
the
pocket
of
an
old
gray
coat
which
lay
beside
him
for
a
soiled
and
crumpled
letter
which
he
finally
unfolded
with
his
thick
clumsy
fingers
then
he
held
it
up
and
looked
at
it
defiantly
i
waant
ye
to
go
to
woodlawn
he
continued
an
look
after
some
bolts
that
arre
up
there
there
a
keg
av
thim
an
sign
the
bill
fer
thim
an
ship
thim
down
to
me
an
thin
i
waant
ye
to
go
down
to
the
ahffice
an
take
thim
this
here
again
he
fished
around
and
produced
another
crumpled
slip
this
time
of
a
yellow
color
how
well
i
came
to
know
them
which
i
soon
learned
was
an
blank
a
form
which
had
to
be
filled
in
and
signed
for
everything
received
if
no
more
than
a
stick
of
wood
or
a
nail
or
a
bolt
the
company
demanded
these
of
all
foremen
in
order
to
keep
its
records
straight
its
accounting
department
was
useless
without
them
at
the
same
time
rourke
kept
talking
of
the
nonsinse
av
it
and
the
onraisonableness
of
demanding
for
everything
ye
think
some
one
was
goin
to
sthale
thim
from
thim
he
declared
irritably
and
defiantly
i
saw
at
once
that
some
infraction
of
the
railroad
rules
had
occurred
and
that
he
had
been
called
down
or
jacked
up
about
it
as
the
railroad
men
expressed
it
he
was
in
a
high
state
of
dudgeon
and
as
defiant
and
pugnacious
as
his
royal
irish
temper
would
allow
at
the
same
time
he
was
pleased
to
think
that
i
or
some
one
had
arrived
who
would
relieve
him
of
this
damnable
nonsinse
or
so
he
hoped
he
was
not
so
inexperienced
as
not
to
imagine
that
i
could
help
him
with
all
this
in
fact
as
time
proved
this
was
my
sole
reason
for
being
here
he
flung
a
parting
shot
at
his
superior
as
i
departed
tell
him
that
i
sign
fer
thim
when
i
get
thim
an
not
before
he
declared
i
went
on
my
way
knowing
full
well
that
no
such
message
was
for
delivery
and
that
he
did
not
intend
that
it
should
be
it
was
just
the
irish
of
it
i
went
off
to
woodlawn
and
secured
the
bolts
after
which
i
went
down
to
the
ahffice
and
reported
there
i
found
the
chief
clerk
a
mere
slip
of
a
dancing
master
in
a
high
collar
and
attractive
office
suit
who
was
also
in
a
high
state
of
dudgeon
because
rourke
as
he
now
explained
had
failed
to
render
an
for
this
and
other
things
and
did
not
seem
to
understand
that
he
the
chief
clerk
must
have
them
to
make
up
his
reports
sometimes
did
not
come
in
for
a
month
or
more
the
goods
lying
around
somewhere
until
rourke
could
use
them
he
wanted
to
know
what
explanation
rourke
had
to
offer
and
when
i
suggested
that
the
latter
thought
apparently
that
he
could
leave
all
consignments
of
goods
in
one
station
or
another
until
such
time
as
he
needed
them
before
he
for
them
he
fairly
foamed
say
he
almost
shouted
at
the
same
time
shoving
his
hands
distractedly
through
his
hair
what
does
he
think
i
am
how
does
he
think
i
going
to
make
up
my
books
he
leave
them
there
until
he
needs
them
will
he
well
he
a
damned
fool
and
you
go
back
and
tell
him
i
said
so
he
been
long
enough
on
the
road
to
know
better
you
go
back
and
tell
him
i
said
that
i
want
a
signed
form
for
everything
consigned
to
him
the
moment
he
learns
that
it
waiting
for
him
and
i
want
it
right
away
without
fail
whether
it
a
single
nut
or
a
car
of
sand
i
want
it
he
got
to
come
to
time
about
this
now
or
going
to
drop
i
not
going
to
stand
it
any
longer
how
does
he
think
i
going
to
make
up
my
books
i
wish
he
let
you
attend
to
these
matters
while
you
up
there
it
will
save
an
awful
lot
of
trouble
in
this
office
and
it
may
save
him
his
job
there
one
thing
sure
got
to
come
to
time
from
now
on
or
either
he
quits
or
i
do
these
same
plus
about
reports
or
calculations
retroactive
and
prospective
covering
every
possible
detail
of
his
work
from
the
acknowledgment
of
all
material
received
up
to
and
including
the
expenditure
of
even
so
much
as
one
mill
worth
of
paper
were
the
bane
of
my
good
foreman
life
as
i
learned
afterward
he
had
nearly
his
whole
family
at
least
a
boy
and
two
girls
assisting
him
nights
on
this
part
of
the
work
in
addition
while
they
were
absolutely
of
no
import
in
so
far
as
the
actual
work
of
construction
was
concerned
and
that
was
really
all
that
interested
rourke
they
were
an
essential
part
of
the
system
which
made
it
possible
for
him
to
do
the
work
at
all
a
point
which
he
did
not
seem
to
be
able
to
get
clear
at
the
same
time
there
was
an
unsatisfactory
side
to
this
office
technicalia
and
it
was
this
if
a
man
could
only
sit
down
and
reel
off
a
graphic
account
of
all
that
he
was
doing
accompanied
by
facts
and
figures
he
was
in
excellent
standing
with
his
superiors
no
matter
what
his
mechanical
defects
might
be
whereas
if
his
reports
were
not
clear
or
were
insufficient
the
efficiency
of
his
work
might
well
be
overlooked
in
a
vague
way
rourke
sensed
this
and
resented
it
he
knew
that
his
work
was
as
good
as
could
be
done
and
yet
here
were
these
constant
reports
and
to
irritate
and
delay
him
apparently
they
aided
actual
construction
no
whit
but
of
course
they
did
although
he
was
a
better
foreman
than
most
still
because
of
his
lack
of
skill
in
this
matter
of
accounting
he
was
looked
upon
as
more
or
less
a
failure
especially
by
the
chief
clerk
naturally
i
explained
that
i
would
do
my
best
and
came
away
when
i
returned
however
i
decided
to
be
politic
i
could
not
very
well
work
with
a
pick
and
shovel
and
this
was
about
all
that
was
left
outside
of
that
i
therefore
explained
as
best
i
could
the
sad
plight
of
the
chief
clerk
who
stood
in
danger
of
losing
his
job
unless
these
things
came
in
promptly
you
see
how
it
is
rourke
do
you
i
pleaded
he
seemed
to
see
but
he
was
still
angry
an
blank
an
blank
he
echoed
contentiously
but
in
a
somewhat
more
conciliatory
spirit
he
wants
an
blank
does
he
well
i
expect
ye
might
as
well
give
thim
to
him
thin
i
think
the
man
lives
on
thim
things
the
way
he
aalways
caallin
fer
thim
ye
think
i
was
a
bookkeeper
an
foreman
at
the
same
time
it
somethin
aaful
an
blank
an
blank
and
he
sputtered
to
silence
a
little
while
later
he
humorously
explained
that
he
had
clane
forgot
thim
anyhow
the
ensuing
month
was
a
busy
one
for
us
we
had
a
platform
to
lay
at
morrisania
a
chimney
to
build
at
tarrytown
a
sidewalk
to
lay
at
white
plains
and
a
large
cistern
to
dig
and
wall
in
at
tuckahoe
besides
these
there
were
platforms
to
build
at
van
cortlandt
and
mount
kisco
at
highbridge
and
ardsley
a
sidewalk
and
drain
at
caryl
a
culvert
and
an
at
bronx
park
and
some
forty
concrete
piers
for
a
building
at
melrose
all
of
which
required
any
amount
of
running
and
figuring
to
say
nothing
of
the
actual
work
of
superintending
and
constructing
which
rourke
alone
could
look
after
it
seemed
ridiculous
to
me
at
the
time
that
any
one
doing
all
this
hard
practical
labor
should
not
be
provided
with
a
clerk
or
an
accountant
to
take
at
least
some
of
this
endless
figuring
off
his
hands
at
the
same
time
if
he
had
been
the
least
bit
clever
he
could
have
provided
himself
with
one
permanently
by
turning
one
of
his
laborers
into
a
clerk
carrying
a
clerk
as
a
laborer
but
plainly
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
he
depended
on
his
family
the
preliminary
labor
alone
of
ordering
and
seeing
that
the
material
was
duly
shipped
and
unloaded
was
one
man
work
and
yet
rourke
was
expected
to
do
it
all
in
spite
of
all
this
however
he
displayed
himself
a
masterful
worker
i
have
never
seen
a
better
he
preferred
to
superintend
of
course
to
get
down
into
the
pit
or
up
on
the
wall
and
measure
and
direct
at
the
same
time
when
necessary
to
expedite
a
difficult
task
he
would
toil
for
hours
at
a
stretch
with
his
trowel
and
his
line
and
his
level
and
his
getting
the
work
into
shape
and
you
would
never
hear
a
personal
complaint
from
him
concerning
the
weariness
of
labor
on
the
contrary
he
would
whistle
and
sing
until
something
went
wrong
when
suddenly
you
would
hear
the
most
terrific
uproar
of
words
come
out
av
that
come
out
now
jasus
christ
man
have
ye
no
sinse
at
aall
put
it
down
put
it
down
what
arre
ye
doin
what
did
i
tell
ye
have
ye
no
raison
in
ye
no
sinse
ye
nagur
great
heavens
i
used
to
think
what
has
happened
now
you
would
have
imagined
the
most
terrible
calamity
and
yet
all
told
it
might
be
nothing
of
any
great
import
a
little
error
of
some
kind
more
threatening
than
real
and
soon
adjusted
it
might
last
for
a
few
moments
during
which
time
the
italians
would
be
seen
hurrying
excitedly
to
and
fro
and
then
there
would
come
a
lull
and
rourke
would
be
heard
to
raise
his
voice
in
tuneful
melody
singing
or
humming
or
whistling
some
irish
but
the
thing
in
rourke
that
would
have
pleased
any
one
was
his
ready
grasp
for
the
actualities
of
life
his
knowledge
that
work
is
the
thing
not
argument
or
reports
or
plans
but
the
direct
accomplishment
of
something
tangible
the
thing
itself
thus
while
i
was
working
with
him
at
least
nothing
that
might
concern
the
clerical
end
of
the
labor
could
disturb
him
but
if
the
sky
fell
and
eight
thousand
chief
clerks
threatened
to
march
upon
him
in
a
body
demanding
reports
and
he
would
imperturbably
make
you
wait
until
the
work
was
done
once
when
i
interrupted
him
to
question
him
concerning
some
of
these
same
wretched
pestering
aftermaths
of
labor
concerning
which
he
alone
could
answer
he
shut
me
off
with
the
reports
the
reports
what
good
arre
the
reports
ye
make
me
sick
what
have
the
reports
to
do
with
the
work
if
it
was
fer
the
work
where
would
the
reports
be
and
i
heartily
echoed
where
another
thing
was
his
charming
attitude
toward
his
men
kindly
and
sweet
for
all
his
storming
that
innate
sense
of
something
intimate
and
fatherly
he
had
a
way
of
saying
kindly
things
in
a
joking
manner
which
touched
them
when
he
arrived
in
the
morning
for
instance
it
was
always
in
the
cheeriest
way
that
he
began
come
now
ye
have
a
good
day
work
before
ye
today
get
the
shovels
jimmie
bring
the
line
matt
and
then
he
would
go
below
himself
if
below
it
was
and
there
would
be
joy
and
peace
until
some
obstacle
to
progress
interfered
i
might
say
in
passing
that
matt
and
jimmie
his
faithful
henchmen
were
each
between
forty
and
fifty
if
they
were
a
day
poor
gnarled
dusty
italians
who
had
come
from
heaven
knows
where
had
endured
god
knows
what
and
were
now
rounding
out
a
existence
under
the
sheltering
wing
of
this
same
rourke
a
great
and
protecting
power
to
them
this
same
matt
was
a
funny
little
italian
soft
of
voice
and
gentle
of
manner
whom
rourke
liked
very
much
but
with
whom
he
loved
to
quarrel
he
would
go
down
in
any
hole
where
the
latter
was
working
and
almost
invariably
shortly
after
you
would
hear
the
most
amazing
uproar
issuing
therefrom
shouts
of
put
it
here
i
say
put
it
here
down
with
it
here
here
jasus
christ
have
ye
no
sinse
at
aall
coupled
of
course
with
occasional
guttural
growls
from
matt
who
was
by
no
means
in
awe
of
his
master
and
who
feared
no
personal
blows
the
latter
had
been
with
rourke
for
so
long
that
he
was
not
in
the
least
overawed
by
his
yelling
and
could
afford
to
take
such
liberties
occasionally
not
always
rourke
would
come
climbing
out
of
the
hole
his
face
and
neck
fairly
scarlet
with
heat
raging
and
shouting
i
get
shut
av
ye
i
have
no
more
thruck
with
ye
ye
blitherin
crazy
loon
what
good
arre
ye
what
work
can
ye
do
naathin
naathin
i
be
shut
av
ye
now
an
thin
maybe
i
have
a
little
then
he
would
dance
around
and
threaten
and
growl
until
something
else
would
take
his
attention
when
he
would
quiet
down
and
be
as
peaceful
as
ever
somehow
i
always
felt
that
in
spite
of
all
the
difficulties
involved
he
enjoyed
these
rows
must
fight
in
short
to
be
happy
sometimes
he
would
go
home
without
saying
a
word
to
matt
a
conclusion
which
at
first
i
imagined
portended
the
end
of
the
latter
but
soon
i
came
to
know
better
for
the
next
morning
matt
would
reappear
as
unconcernedly
as
though
nothing
had
happened
and
rourke
would
appear
not
to
notice
or
remember
once
anent
all
this
i
said
to
him
rourke
how
many
times
have
you
threatened
to
discharge
matt
in
the
last
three
years
shewer
he
replied
with
his
ingratiating
grin
a
man
do
mane
aall
he
says
aall
the
time
the
most
humorous
of
all
his
collection
of
workingmen
however
was
the
aforementioned
jimmie
a
dark
calabrian
who
had
the
shrewdness
of
a
machiavelli
and
the
pertness
of
a
crow
he
lived
in
the
same
neighborhood
as
rourke
far
out
in
one
of
those
small
towns
on
the
harlem
sheltering
so
many
italians
for
like
a
hen
with
a
brood
of
chicks
rourke
kept
all
his
italians
gathered
close
about
him
jimmie
curiously
was
the
one
who
was
always
selected
to
run
his
family
errands
for
him
a
kind
of
valet
to
rourke
as
it
were
selected
for
some
merit
i
could
never
discover
certainly
not
one
of
speed
he
was
nevertheless
constantly
running
here
and
there
like
an
errand
boy
his
worn
dusty
baggy
clothes
making
him
look
like
a
dilapidated
bandit
fresh
from
a
sewer
on
the
job
however
no
matter
what
it
might
be
jimmie
could
never
be
induced
to
do
real
hard
work
he
was
always
above
it
or
busy
with
something
else
but
as
he
was
an
expert
and
knew
just
how
to
load
and
unload
the
two
sinecures
of
sorts
nothing
was
ever
said
to
him
if
any
one
dared
to
reprove
him
myself
for
instance
a
mere
interloper
to
jimmie
he
would
reply
yeh
yeh
i
my
biz
i
been
now
with
misha
rook
fifteen
year
i
my
biz
if
you
made
any
complaint
to
rourke
he
would
merely
grin
and
say
ha
jimmie
the
sharp
one
or
perhaps
i
get
ye
yet
ye
fox
but
more
than
that
nothing
was
ever
done
one
day
however
jimmie
failed
to
comply
with
an
extraordinary
order
of
rourke
which
while
it
resulted
in
no
real
damage
produced
a
most
laughable
and
yet
characteristic
scene
a
strict
rule
of
the
company
was
that
no
opening
of
any
kind
into
which
a
person
might
possibly
step
or
fall
should
be
left
uncovered
at
any
station
during
the
approach
stay
or
departure
of
any
train
scheduled
to
stop
at
that
station
rourke
was
well
aware
of
this
rule
he
had
a
copy
of
it
on
file
in
his
collection
of
circulars
in
addition
he
had
especially
delegated
jimmie
to
attend
to
this
matter
a
task
which
just
suited
the
italian
as
it
gave
him
ample
time
to
idle
about
and
pretend
to
be
watching
this
it
was
which
made
the
crime
all
the
greater
on
this
particular
occasion
jimmie
had
failed
to
attend
to
this
matter
we
had
been
working
on
the
platform
at
williamsbridge
digging
a
pit
for
a
when
a
train
bearing
the
general
foreman
came
along
the
latter
got
off
at
the
station
especially
to
examine
the
work
that
had
been
done
so
far
when
the
train
arrived
there
was
the
hole
wide
open
with
rourke
below
shouting
and
gesticulating
about
something
and
totally
unconscious
of
course
that
his
order
had
been
neglected
the
general
foreman
who
was
by
the
way
i
believe
an
admirer
of
rourke
came
forward
looked
down
and
said
quietly
this
wo
do
rourke
you
have
to
keep
the
work
covered
when
a
train
is
approaching
told
you
that
before
you
know
rourke
looked
up
so
astonished
and
ashamed
that
he
should
have
been
put
in
such
a
position
before
his
superior
that
he
hardly
knew
what
to
say
i
doubt
if
any
one
ever
had
a
greater
capacity
for
respecting
his
superiors
anyhow
instead
of
trying
to
answer
he
merely
choked
and
began
to
shout
for
jimmie
who
came
running
crying
as
he
always
did
what
da
mat
what
da
mat
what
da
mat
what
da
mat
mocked
rourke
fairly
seething
with
a
marvelous
irish
fury
what
the
devil
do
ye
suppose
is
the
mat
what
do
ye
mane
be
waalkin
away
an
the
hole
uncovered

a
thing
like
that

an
wilson
comin
along
here
an
the
hole
open
he
was
as
red
as
a
beet
purple
almost
perspiring
apoplectic
during
all
this
tirade
wilson
a
sad
dark
person
troubled
with
acute
indigestion
i
fancy
stood
by
with
an
amused
kindly
and
yet
mock
severe
expression
on
his
face
i
am
sure
he
did
not
wish
to
be
severe
jimmie
dumbfounded
scarcely
knew
what
to
say
in
the
face
of
rage
and
the
foreman
presence
he
did
his
best
to
remedy
his
error
by
covering
the
hole
at
the
same
time
stuttering
something
about
going
for
a
trowel
a
trowel
cried
rourke
glaring
at
him
a
trowel
ye
ginny
what
ye
be
doin
lookin
fer
a
trowel
an
a
train
comin
that
close
on
ye
it

knocked
ye
off
the
thrack
an
the
hole
open
an
wilson
right
here

that
what
i
told

is
that
what
i
pay

fer

do
let
me
ketch
ye
such
a
place
as
that
open
again
i
get
shut
av
ye
ye
blitherin
lunatic
when
it
was
all
over
and
the
train
bearing
the
general
foreman
had
gone
rourke
quieted
down
but
not
without
many
fulgurous
flashes
that
kept
the
poor
italian
on
tenterhooks
about
an
hour
later
however
another
train
arrived
and
by
reason
of
some
intervening
necessity
and
the
idle
wandering
mood
of
the
italian
the
hole
was
open
again
jimmie
was
away
behind
the
depot
somewhere
smoking
perhaps
and
rourke
was
as
usual
down
in
the
hole
this
time
misfortune
trebled
itself
however
by
bringing
not
the
general
foreman
but
the
supervisor
himself
a
grave
quiet
man
of
whom
rourke
stood
in
the
greatest
awe
he
was
so
solid
so
profound
so
severe
i
do
believe
i
ever
saw
him
smile
he
walked
up
to
the
hole
and
looking
reproachfully
down
said
is
this
the
way
you
leave
your
excavations
rourke
when
a
train
is
coming
do
you
know
better
than
to
do
a
thing
like
that
jimmie
shouted
rourke
leaping
to
the
surface
of
the
earth
with
a
bound
jimmie
now
be
jasus
where
is
that
eyetalian
i
tell
him
not
to
this
place
open
and
he
began
shoving
the
planks
into
place
himself
jimmie
suddenly
made
aware
of
this
new
catastrophe
came
running
as
fast
as
his
short
legs
would
carry
him
scared
almost
out
of
his
wits
he
was
as
pale
as
a
very
dark
and
dirty
italian
could
be
and
so
wrought
up
that
his
facial
expression
changed
involuntarily
from
moment
to
moment
rourke
was
in
a
fairly
murderous
mood
only
he
was
so
excited
and
ashamed
that
he
could
not
speak
here
was
the
supervisor
and
here
was
himself
and
conditions
necessity
for
order
would
not
permit
him
to
kill
the
italian
in
the
former
presence
he
could
only
choke
and
wait
to
think
that
he
should
be
made
a
mark
of
like
this
and
that
in
the
face
of
his
great
supervisor
his
face
and
neck
were
a
and
his
eyes
flashed
with
anger
he
merely
glared
at
his
recalcitrant
henchman
as
much
as
to
say
wait
when
this
train
had
departed
and
the
dignified
supervisor
had
been
carried
safely
out
of
hearing
he
turned
on
jimmie
with
all
the
fury
of
a
masterful
and
excitable
temper
so
ye
naht
cover
the
hole
after
me
tellin
ye
naht

minutes
ago

he
shouted

jimmie
weakly

rourke

was

his
angry
face
shoved
close
to
the
italian

an
niver
show
me
yer

again
and
he
made
a
motion
as
if
he
would
grab
him
and
rend
him
limb
from
limb
jimmie
well
aware
of
his
dire
position
was
too
clever
however
to
let
rourke
seize
him
during
all
this
conversation
he
had
been
slowly
backing
away
always
safely
beyond
rourke
reach
and
now
ran
an
amazing
feat
for
him
he
had
evidently
been
through
many
such
scenes
before
he
retreated
first
behind
the
depot
and
then
when
rourke
had
gone
to
work
once
more
down
in
his
hole
came
back
and
took
a
safe
position
on
guard
over
the
hitherto
sadly
neglected
opening
when
the
next
train
came
he
was
there
to
shove
the
boards
over
before
it
neared
the
station
and
nothing
more
was
said
about
the
matter
rourke
did
not
appear
to
notice
him
he
did
not
even
seem
to
see
that
he
was
there
the
next
morning
however
when
the
latter
came
to
work
as
usual
it
was
come
matt
come
jimmie
just
as
if
nothing
had
happened
i
was
never
more
astonished
in
my
life
an
incident
even
more
ridiculous
but
illustrative
of
the
atmosphere
in
which
rourke
dwelt
occurred
at
highbridge
one
frosty
october
sunday
morning
where
because
of
seepage
from
a
hill
which
threatened
to
undermine
some
tracks
rourke
was
ordered
to
hurry
and
build
a
drain
a
thing
which
because
the
order
came
on
saturday
afternoon
required
sunday
labor
a
most
unusual
thing
in
his
case
but
in
spite
of
the
order
rourke
who
was
a
good
catholic
felt
impelled
before
coming
to
go
to
at
least
early
mass
and
in
addition
a
regular
sunday
practice
with
him
i
presume
to
put
on
a
prince
albert
coat
which
i
had
never
seen
before
and
which
lent
to
his
stocky
figure
some
amusing
lines
it
was
really
too
tight
having
been
worn
i
presume
every
sunday
regularly
since
his
wedding
day
in
addition
he
had
donned
a
brown
derby
hat
which
to
me
at
least
gave
him
a
most
unfamiliar
look
i
being
curious
more
than
anything
else
and
wishing
to
be
out
of
doors
as
much
as
possible
also
went
up
arriving
on
the
scene
about
nine
rourke
did
not
arrive
until
ten
in
the
meantime
i
proceeded
to
build
myself
a
fire
on
the
dock
for
we
were
alongside
the
harlem
river
and
a
brisk
wind
was
blowing
then
rourke
came
fresh
from
church
smiling
and
genial
in
the
most
cheerful
frame
of
mind
but
plainly
a
little
conscious
of
his
grand
garb
my
i
said
surveying
him
you
look
fine
i
never
saw
you
dressed
up
before
aaf
with
yer
taalk
he
replied
i
know
well
enough
how
i
look
good
enough
then
he
bestirred
himself
about
the
task
of
examining
what
had
been
done
so
far
but
i
could
see
in
spite
of
all
the
busy
assurance
with
which
he
worked
that
he
was
still
highly
conscious
of
his
clothes
and
a
little
disturbed
by
what
i
or
others
might
think
his
garb
plainly
suited
his
mood
much
better
everything
went
smoothly
until
noon
not
a
cloud
in
the
sky
when
looking
across
the
tracks
at
that
hour
i
beheld
coming
toward
us
with
more
or
less
uncertain
step
another
individual
stocky
of
figure
and
evidently
bent
on
seeing
rourke
an
irishman
as
large
as
rourke
younger
and
if
anything
considerably
coarser
in
fiber
he
was
very
smooth
shaven
with
a
black
derby
hat
pulled
down
over
his
eyes
and
wearing
a
somewhat
faded
brown
suit
he
was
drunk
or
nearly
so
that
was
plain
from
the
first
from
the
moment
rourke
beheld
him
he
seemed
beside
himself
with
anger
or
irritation
his
expression
changed
completely
and
he
began
to
swell
as
was
customary
with
him
when
he
was
angry
as
though
suffering
from
an
internal
eruption
of
some
kind
the
i
heard
him
mutter
now
be
gob
what
that
felly
be
waantin
and
then
as
the
stranger
drew
nearer
who
was
it
tould
him
i
was
here
maybe
some
waan
at
the
ahffice
regardless
of
his
speculations
on
this
score
the
stranger
picked
his
way
across
the
tracks
and
came
directly
to
him
his
face
and
manner
indicating
no
particularly
friendly
frame
of
mind
maybe
ye
be
lettin
me
have
that
money
now
he
began
instanter
and
when
rourke
made
no
reply
merely
staring
at
him
he
added
i
be
waantin
to
know
now
when
it
is
ye
goin
to
give
me
the
rest
av
me
time
fer
that
scarborough
job
i
been
waitin
long
enough
rourke
stirred
irritably
and
aggressively
before
he
spoke
he
seemed
greatly
put
out
shamed
to
think
that
the
man
should
come
here
so
especially
on
this
peaceful
sabbath
morning
i
tould
ye
before
he
replied
defiantly
after
a
time
that
had
aall
ye
earned
an
more
ye
left
me
without
finishin
yer
work
ye
get
no
more
time
from
me
if
ye
waant
more
go
down
to
the
ahffice
an
see
if
they
give
it
to
ye
i
have
no
money
fer
ye
here
and
he
resumed
a
comfortable
position
before
the
fire
his
hands
behind
his
back
it
siven
dollars
ye
still
owe
me
returned
the
other
ignoring
rourke
reply
an
i
waant
it
now
well
ye
naht

it
replied
my
boss
i
naathin
fer
ye
tellin
ye

owe

that
so
returned
the
other
well
we
see
about
that
ye
be
after
givin
it
to
me
er
i
get
it
out
of
ye
somehow

insisted
rourke
ye

as
well
go
away
from
here
ye
get
naathin
if
ye
waant
anything
more
go
an
see
the
ahffice
and
now
he
strode
away
to
where
the
italians
were
ignoring
the
stranger
completely
and
muttering
something
about
his
being
drunk
the
latter
followed
him
however
over
to
where
he
stood
and
continued
the
dispute
rourke
ignored
him
as
much
as
possible
only
exclaiming
once
me
be
man
ye
drunk
i
naht
drunk
returned
the
other
once
an
fer
all
now
i
ye
arre
ye
goin
to
give
me
that
money
no
replied
rourke
i
naht
belave
me
said
the
stranger
i
get
it
out
av
ye
somehow
but
for
the
moment
he
made
no
move
merely
hanging
about
in
an
uncertain
way
he
seemed
to
have
no
definite
plan
for
collecting
the
money
or
if
he
had
he
had
by
now
abandoned
it
without
paying
any
more
attention
to
him
rourke
still
very
irritated
and
defiant
returned
to
the
fire
he
tried
to
appear
calm
and
indifferent
but
the
a
mason
i
judged
followed
after
standing
before
him
and
staring
in
the
defiant
irritating
way
a
drunken
man
will
not
quite
able
to
make
up
his
mind
what
else
to
do
presently
rourke
more
to
relieve
the
tedium
of
an
embarrassing
situation
than
anything
else
a
number
of
accusatory
remarks
having
been
passed
turned
and
began
poking
at
the
blaze
finally
bending
over
to
lay
on
a
stick
of
wood
on
the
instant
and
as
if
seized
by
sudden
inspiration
whether
because
the
tails
of
rourke
long
coat
hung
out
in
a
most
provoking
fashion
and
suggested
the
thing
that
followed
or
not
i
do
know
but
now
the
intruder
jumped
forward
and
seizing
them
in
a
most
nimble
and
yet
vigorous
clutch
gave
an
amazing
yank
which
severed
them
straight
up
the
back
from
seat
to
nape
at
the
same
time
exclaiming
ye
naht
pay
me
will
ye
ye
naht
will
ye
on
the
instant
a
tremendous
change
came
over
the
scene
it
was
as
swift
as
stage
play
instantly
rourke
was
upright
and
faced
about
shouting
now
be
gob
ye
torn
me
coat
have
ye
now
i
tache
ye
now
show
ye
wait
get
ready
now
now
i
fix
ye
ye
drunken
loafer
and
at
the
same
time
he
began
to
move
upon
the
enemy
in
a
kind
of
rhythmic
cryptic
circle
some
law
governing
anger
and
emotion
i
presume
the
while
his
hands
opened
and
shut
and
his
eyes
looked
as
though
they
would
be
veiled
completely
by
his
narrowing
lids
at
the
same
time
the
stranger
apparently
seeing
his
danger
began
backing
and
circling
in
the
same
way
around
rourke
as
well
as
around
the
fire
until
it
looked
as
though
they
were
performing
a
war
dance
round
and
round
they
went
like
two
hopi
bucks
or
zulu
warriors
their
faces
displaying
the
most
murderous
cunning
and
intention
to
slay
only
instead
of
feathers
and
beads
they
had
on
their
negligible
best
all
the
while
rourke
was
calling
come
on
now
get
ready
now
i
show
ye
now
i
fix
ye
now
it
me
coat
ye
rip
is
it
come
on
now
get
ready
make
yerself
ready
i
goin
to
give
ye
the
lickin
av
yer
life
come
on
now
come
on
now
come
on
now
it
was
as
though
each
had
been
secreted
from
the
other
and
had
to
be
sought
out
in
some
mysterious
manner
and
in
a
circle
in
spite
of
the
feeling
of
distress
that
an
impending
struggle
of
this
kind
gives
one
i
could
not
help
noting
the
comic
condition
of
rourke
back
the
long
coat
beautifully
ripped
straight
up
the
back
its
ends
fluttering
in
the
wind
like
fans
and
exposing
his
waistcoat
and
sunday
boiled
white
shirt
and
laying
up
a
laugh
for
the
future
it
was
too
ridiculous
the
stranger
had
a
most
impressive
and
yet
absurd
air
of
drunken
sternness
written
in
his
face
a
look
whether
anything
serious
would
really
have
happened
i
was
never
permitted
to
learn
for
now
in
addition
to
myself
and
the
italians
all
of
them
excited
and
ready
to
defend
their
lord
and
master
some
passengers
from
the
nearby
station
and
the
street
above
as
well
as
a
foreman
of
a
section
gang
helping
at
this
same
task
a
great
hulking
brute
of
a
man
who
looked
quite
able
to
handle
both
rourke
and
his
opponent
at
one
and
the
same
time
came
forward
and
joined
in
this
excited
circle
considerable
effort
was
made
on
the
part
of
the
latter
to
learn
just
what
the
trouble
was
after
which
the
big
foreman
interposed
with
what
the
trouble
here
come
now
what
all
this
row
rourke
ye
would
fight
here
would
ye
have
him
arristed

say
ye
know
him
but
do
be
fightin
here
supposin
waan
av
the
bosses
should
be
comin
along
now
and
at
the
same
time
he
interposed
his
great
bulk
between
the
two
rourke
quieted
some
by
this
interruption
but
still
sputtering
with
rage
and
disgrace
shouted
lookit
me
coat
lookit
what
he
done
to
me
coat
see
what
he
done
to
me
coat
man
alive
d
think

i
tache
him
to
be
comin
around
an
disturbin
a
man
when
he
at
his
work
i
fix
him
now
and
once
more
he
began
to
move
but
the
great
foreman
was
not
so
easily
to
be
disposed
of
well
then
let
caall
the
police
he
argued
in
a
highly
conciliatory
mood
ye
ca
be
fightin

here
sure
ye
do
waant
to
do
that
what
the
chafe
think
what
is
it
ye
think
av
yerself
at
the
same
time
he
turned
to
find
the
intruder
and
demand
to
know
what
he
meant
by
it
but
the
latter
had
already
decamped
seeing
the
crowd
that
had
and
was
gathering
and
that
he
was
likely
to
encounter
more
forms
of
trouble
than
he
had
anticipated
he
had
started
down
the
track
toward
mott
haven
i
fix
ye
rourke
shouted
when
he
saw
him
going
ye
pay
fer
this
i
have
ye
arristed
wait
ye
naht
get
aaf
so
aisy
this
time
but
just
the
same
the
storm
was
over
for
the
present
anyhow
the
man
gone
and
in
a
little
while
rourke
left
for
his
home
at
mount
vernon
to
repair
his
tattered
condition
i
never
saw
a
man
so
crestfallen
nor
one
more
determined
to
have
the
laa
on
him
in
my
life
afterwards
when
i
inquired
very
cautiously
what
he
had
done
about
it
this
was
a
week
or
two
later
he
replied
shewer
what
can
ye
do
with
a
loafer
like
that
he
has
no
money
an
lockin
him
up
wo
help
his
wife
an
children
any
thus
ended
a
perfect
scene
out
of
kilkenny
it
was
not
so
very
long
after
i
arrived
that
rourke
began
to
tell
me
of
a
building
which
the
company
was
going
to
erect
in
mott
haven
yard
one
of
its
great
switching
centers
it
was
to
be
an
important
affair
according
to
him
sixty
by
two
hundred
feet
in
breadth
and
length
of
brick
and
stone
and
was
to
be
built
under
a
time
limit
of
three
months
an
arrangement
by
which
the
company
hoped
to
find
out
how
satisfactorily
it
could
do
work
for
itself
rather
than
by
outside
contract
which
it
was
always
hoping
to
avoid
from
his
manner
and
conversation
i
judged
that
rourke
was
eager
to
get
this
job
for
he
had
been
a
contractor
of
some
ability
in
his
day
before
he
ever
went
to
work
for
the
company
and
felt
i
am
sure
that
fate
had
done
him
an
injustice
in
not
allowing
him
to
remain
one
in
addition
he
felt
a
little
above
the
odds
and
ends
of
masonry
that
he
was
now
called
on
to
do
where
formerly
he
had
done
so
much
more
important
work
he
was
eager
to
be
a
real
foreman
once
more
a
big
one
and
to
show
the
company
that
he
could
erect
this
building
and
thus
make
a
little
place
for
himself
in
the
latter
good
graces
although
to
what
end
i
could
not
quite
make
out
he
would
never
have
made
a
suitable
general
foreman
at
the
same
time
he
was
a
little
afraid
of
the
clerical
details
those
terrible
nightmares
of
reports
and
the
like
how
arre
ye
feelin
teddy
he
often
inquired
of
me
during
this
period
with
a
greater
show
of
interest
in
my
troublesome
health
than
ever
before
i
talked
of
leaving
i
suppose
from
time
to
time
because
sheer
financial
necessity
was
about
to
compel
it
fine
rourke
i
would
say
never
better
i
feeling
better
every
day
that
good
ye
the
right
man
in
the
right
place
now
if
ye
was
to
sthay
a
year
er
two
at
this
work
it
would
be
the
makin
av
ye
ye
too
thin
ye
need
more
chist
and
he
would
tap
my
bony
chest
in
a
kindly
manner
i
niver
have
a
sick
day
meself
that
right
rourke
i
replied
pleasantly
feeling
keenly
the
need
of
staying
by
so
wonderful
a
lamp
of
health
i
intend
to
stick
at
it
as
long
as
i
can
ye
ought
to
it
do
ye
good
if
we
get
the
new
buildin
to
build
it
be
better
yet
for
ye
ye
have
plenty
to
do
there
to
relave
yer
mind
relieve
indeed
i
thought
but
i
did
not
say
so
on
the
contrary
i
felt
so
much
sympathy
for
this
lusty
irishman
and
his
reasonable
ambitions
that
i
desired
to
help
him
and
urged
him
to
get
it
i
suggested
indirectly
that
i
would
see
him
through
which
touched
him
greatly
he
was
a
grateful
creature
in
his
way
but
so
excitable
and
so
helplessly
that
there
was
no
way
of
aiding
him
without
doing
it
in
a
secret
or
rather
manner
he
would
have
much
preferred
to
struggle
along
alone
and
fail
though
i
doubt
whether
real
failure
could
have
come
to
rourke
so
essentially
capable
was
he
in
another
three
weeks
the
work
was
really
given
him
to
do
and
then
began
one
of
the
finest
exhibitions
of
irish
domination
and
that
i
have
ever
witnessed
we
moved
to
mott
haven
yard
a
great
network
of
tracks
and
buildings
in
the
center
of
which
this
new
building
was
to
be
erected
rourke
was
given
a
large
force
of
men
whom
he
fairly
gloried
in
bossing
he
had
as
many
as
forty
italians
to
say
nothing
of
a
number
of
and
masons
not
those
shrewd
hawks
clever
enough
to
belong
to
the
union
but
wasters
and
failures
of
another
type
who
did
the
preliminary
work
of
digging
for
the
foundation
etc
handling
these
rourke
was
in
his
element
he
loved
to
see
so
much
brisk
work
going
on
he
would
trot
to
and
fro
about
the
place
beaming
in
the
most
angelic
fashion
and
shouting
orders
that
could
be
heard
all
over
the
neighborhood
it
was
delicious
to
watch
him
at
times
he
would
stand
by
the
long
trenches
where
the
men
were
digging
for
the
foundation
a
great
line
of
them
their
backs
bent
over
their
work
and
rub
his
hands
in
pleasingly
human
satisfaction
saying
we
goin
along
fine
teddy
i
can
jist
see
me
way
to
the
top
av
the
buildin
and
then
he
would
proceed
to
harass
and
annoy
his
men
out
of
pure
exuberance
of
spirits
ye
waant
to
dig
it
so
man
or
ye
do
handle
yer
pick
right
ye
see
that
hold
it
this
way
sometimes
he
would
get
down
in
the
trench
and
demonstrate
just
how
it
was
to
be
done
a
thing
which
greatly
amused
some
of
the
workmen
frequently
he
would
exhibit
to
me
little
tricks
or
knacks
of
his
trade
such
as
throwing
a
trowel
ten
feet
so
that
it
would
stick
in
a
piece
of
wood
turning
a
shovel
over
with
a
lump
of
dirt
on
it
and
not
dropping
the
lump
and
similar
simple
acts
always
adding
ye
niver
be
a
mason
till
ye
can
do
that
when
he
was
tired
of
fussing
with
the
men
outside
he
would
come
around
to
the
little
wooden
shed
where
i
was
keeping
the
mass
of
orders
and
reports
in
shape
and
getting
his
material
ready
for
him
and
look
over
the
papers
in
the
most
knowing
manner
when
he
had
satisfied
himself
that
everything
was
going
right
he
would
exclaim
ye
jist
the
fer
the
place
teddy
ye
made
a
good
bookkeeper
if
ever
i
get
to
be
prisident
i
make
ye
me
sicretary
av
state
but
the
thing
which
really
interested
and
enthralled
rourke
was
the
coming
of
the
masons
those
hardy
buccaneers
of
the
laboring
world
who
come
and
go
as
they
please
asking
no
favors
and
brooking
no
interference
plainly
he
envied
them
their
reckless
independence
at
the
same
time
that
he
desired
to
control
their
labor
in
his
favor
a
task
worthy
of
the
shrewdest
diplomat
never
in
my
life
have
i
seen
such
a
gay
ruthless
inconsiderate
point
of
view
as
these
same
union
masons
represented
a
most
astounding
lot
they
were
are
i
suppose
i
should
say
our
modern
buccaneers
and
captain
kidds
of
the
laboring
world
demanding
if
you
please
their
six
a
day
starting
and
stopping
almost
when
they
please
doing
just
as
little
as
they
dare
and
yet
face
their
own
decaying
conscience
dropping
any
task
at
the
most
critical
and
dangerous
point
and
in
other
ways
rejoicing
in
and
disporting
themselves
in
such
a
way
as
to
annoy
the
representatives
of
any
corporation
great
or
small
that
suffered
the
sad
compulsion
of
employing
them
seriously
i
am
not
against
union
laborers
i
like
them
they
spell
rude
blazing
life
but
when
you
have
to
deal
with
them
plainly
rourke
anticipated
endless
rows
their
coming
promised
him
the
opportunity
he
inmostly
desired
i
suppose
of
once
more
fussing
and
fuming
with
real
strong
determined
and
pugnacious
men
like
himself
who
would
not
take
his
onslaughts
tamely
but
would
fight
him
back
as
he
wished
strong
men
to
do
he
was
never
weary
of
talking
of
them
wait
till
we
have
thirty
er
forty
av
thim
on
the
line
he
once
observed
to
me
in
connection
with
them
every
man
layin
his
six
hundred
bricks
a
day
er
takin
aaf
his
apron
thim
the
times
see
what
excitement
manes
me
thim
the
times
what
i
see
rourke
i
asked
interestedly
throuble
enough
shewer
they
no
crapin
eyetalians
that
let
ye
taalk
to
thim
as
ye
indade
not
ye
have
to
fight
with
them
fellies
well
that
a
queer
state
of
affairs
i
remarked
and
then
added
do
you
think
you
can
handle
them
rourke
handle
thim
he
exclaimed
his
glorious
wrath
kindling
in
anticipation
of
a
possible
conflict
handle
thim
an
the
likes
av
a
thousand
av
thim
i
know
them
aall
every
waan
av
thim
an
their
thricks
it
naht
foolin
me
they
be
but
me
he
added
instructively
it
a
fine
job
ye
have
runnin
down
to
the
ahffice
gettin
their
time
this
is
the
railroad
man
expression
for
money
due
or
wages
have
plenty
av
that
to
do
i
tellin
ye
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
going
to
discharge
them
rourke
do
you
i
asked
shewer
he
exclaimed
authoritatively
why
should
i
they
jist
the
same
as
other
min
why
should
i
then
he
added
after
a
pause
but
it
thim
that
be
comin
to
me
askin
fer
their
time
instid
av
me
givin
it
to
thim
niver
fear
they
not
the
kind
that
let
ye
taalk
back
to
thim
if
their
work
do
suit
ye
it
me
me
time
wait
till
they
be
comin
round
half
drunk
in
the
mornin
an
not
feelin
just
right
thim
the
times
ye
find
out
what
masons
arre
made
av
me
i
confess
this
probability
did
not
seem
as
brilliant
to
me
as
it
did
to
him
but
it
had
its
humor
i
expressed
wonder
that
he
would
hire
them
if
they
were
such
a
bad
lot
where
else
will
ye
get
min
he
demanded
to
know
the
unions
have
the
best
an
the
most
av
thim
thim
outside
fellies
do
amount
to
much
they
aall
pore
crapin
creatures
if
it
was
fer
the
railroad
bein
against
the
union
i
would
have
thim
at
aall
and
besides
he
added
thoughtfully
and
with
a
keen
show
of
feeling
for
their
point
of
view
they
have
a
right
to
do
as
they
shewer
it
no
common
workmen
they
arre
they
can
lay
their
eight
hundred
bricks
a
day
if
they
will
an
no
advice
from
any
waan
if
ye
was
in
their
place
ye
do
the
same
there
no
sinse
in
allowin
another
man
to
waalk
on
ye
whin
ye
can
get
another
job
i
do
blame
thim
i
was
a
mason
wanst
meself
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
acted
as
you
say
these
men
are
going
to
act
shewer
well
i
should
think
you
be
very
proud
of
it
i
have
me
rights
he
declared
flaring
up
what
kind
av
a
man
is
it
that
let
himself
be
waalked
on
there
no
sinse
in
it
it
naht
natchral
it
naht
intinded
that
it
should
be
so
very
well
i
said
smoothing
the
whole
thing
over
and
so
that
ended
well
the
masons
came
and
a
fine
lot
of
pirates
they
surely
were
such
independence
such
defiance
such
feverish
punctilio
in
regard
to
their
rights
and
what
forms
and
procedures
they
were
entitled
to
i
stared
in
amazement
for
the
most
part
they
were
hale
healthy
industrious
looking
creatures
but
so
obstreperously
conscious
of
their
own
rights
and
so
proud
of
their
skill
as
masons
that
there
was
no
living
with
them
really
they
would
have
tried
the
patience
of
a
saint
let
alone
a
healthy
contentious
irish
first
off
as
the
railroad
men
used
to
say
they
wanted
to
know
whether
there
were
any
men
on
the
job
and
if
so
would
they
be
discharged
instanter
if
not
no
work
a
situation
which
gave
rourke
several
splendid
opportunities
for
altercations
which
he
hastened
to
improve
although
the
men
of
course
then
they
wanted
to
know
when
where
and
how
they
were
to
get
their
money
whether
on
demand
at
any
time
they
chose
and
this
led
to
more
trouble
since
the
railroad
paid
only
once
a
month
however
this
was
adjusted
by
a
special
arrangement
being
made
whereby
the
building
department
stood
ready
to
pay
them
instantly
on
demand
only
i
had
to
run
down
to
the
division
office
each
time
and
get
their
pay
for
them
at
any
time
that
they
came
to
ask
for
it
then
came
an
argument
or
many
of
them
as
to
the
number
of
bricks
they
were
to
lay
an
hour
the
number
of
men
they
were
to
carry
on
one
line
or
wall
the
length
of
time
they
were
supposed
to
work
or
had
worked
or
would
work
all
of
which
was
pure
food
and
drink
to
rourke
he
was
in
his
element
at
last
shouting
gesticulating
demanding
that
they
leave
or
go
to
after
all
these
things
had
been
adjusted
however
they
finally
consented
to
go
to
work
and
then
of
course
the
work
flew
it
was
a
grand
scene
really
inspiring
forty
or
fifty
masons
on
the
line
perhaps
half
as
many
helpers
or
mixers
the
italians
carrying
bricks
and
a
score
of
carpenters
now
arriving
under
another
foreman
to
set
the
beams
and
lay
the
joists
as
the
walls
rose
upward
rourke
was
about
all
the
time
now
arguing
and
gesticulating
with
this
man
or
that
fighting
with
this
one
or
the
other
and
calling
always
to
some
mason
or
other
to
come
down
and
get
his
time
come
down
come
down
i
would
hear
and
then
would
see
him
rushing
for
the
office
a
defiant
and
even
threatening
mason
at
his
heels
rourke
demanding
that
i
make
out
a
at
once
for
the
latter
and
go
down
to
the
ahffice
and
get
the
money
the
while
the
mason
hung
about
attempting
to
seduce
other
men
to
a
similar
point
of
view
once
in
a
while
but
only
on
rare
occasions
rourke
would
patch
up
a
truce
with
a
man
as
a
rule
the
mason
was
only
too
eager
to
leave
and
spend
the
money
thus
far
earned
while
rourke
was
curiously
indifferent
as
to
whether
he
went
or
stayed
is
to
drink
he
waants
he
would
declare
amusedly
to
me
it
was
all
like
a
scene
out
of
comic
opera
toward
the
last
however
a
natural
calm
set
in
the
result
no
doubt
of
weariness
and
a
sense
of
surfeit
which
sent
the
building
forward
apace
during
this
time
rourke
was
to
be
seen
walking
defiantly
up
and
down
the
upper
scaffolding
of
the
steadily
rising
walls
or
down
below
on
the
ground
in
front
of
his
men
his
hands
behind
his
back
his
face
screwed
into
a
quizzical
expression
his
whole
body
bearing
a
look
of
bristling
content
and
pugnacity
which
was
too
delicious
for
words
since
things
were
going
especially
well
he
could
not
say
much
but
still
he
could
look
his
contentiousness
and
did
even
now
he
would
occasionally
manage
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
some
lusty
mason
or
other
which
resulted
in
the
customary
descent
to
the
office
but
not
often
but
one
cold
december
day
about
three
weeks
later
when
i
was
just
about
to
announce
that
i
could
no
longer
delay
my
departure
seeing
that
my
health
was
now
as
good
or
nearly
so
as
my
purse
was
lean
and
that
whether
i
would
or
no
i
must
arrange
to
make
more
money
that
a
most
dreadful
accident
occurred
it
appeared
that
rourke
and
a
number
of
italians
including
matt
and
jimmie
were
down
in
the
main
room
of
the
building
now
fast
nearing
completion
when
the
boiler
of
the
hoisting
engine
which
had
been
placed
inside
the
building
and
just
at
the
juncture
of
three
walls
blew
up
and
knocked
out
this
wall
and
the
joists
of
the
second
and
third
floors
loose
thus
precipitating
all
of
fifteen
thousand
bricks
which
had
been
placed
on
the
third
floor
into
this
room
below
for
a
few
moments
there
had
been
a
veritable
hurricane
of
bricks
and
falling
timber
and
then
when
it
was
over
it
was
found
that
the
mighty
rourke
and
five
italians
were
embedded
in
or
under
them
and
all
but
jimmie
more
or
less
seriously
injured
or
killed
two
italians
were
killed
outright
a
third
died
later
rourke
in
particular
was
unfortunately
placed
and
terribly
injured
his
body
from
the
waist
down
was
completely
buried
by
a
pile
of
bricks
and
across
his
shoulder
lay
a
great
joist
pressing
where
it
had
struck
him
and
cutting
his
neck
and
ear
he
was
a
pathetic
sight
when
we
entered
bleeding
and
yet
grim
and
undaunted
as
one
might
have
expected
i
tight
fast
me
lad
he
said
when
he
could
speak
it
me
legs
that
caught
not
me
body
but
give
a
hand
to
the
min
there
the
eyetalians
are
underneath
disregarding
his
suggestion
however
we
began
working
about
him
every
man
throwing
away
bricks
like
a
machine
but
he
would
not
have
it
to
the
min
he
insisted
with
all
of
his
old
firmness
the
eyetalians
are
under
there
matt
an
jimmie
ca
ye
see
that
i
be
all
right
till
ye
get
thim
out
come
look
after
the
min
we
fell
to
this
end
of
the
work
although
by
now
others
had
arrived
and
soon
there
was
a
great
crowd
assisting
men
coming
from
the
yard
and
the
machine
shop
although
embedded
in
this
mass
of
material
and
most
severely
injured
there
was
no
gainsaying
him
and
he
still
insisted
on
directing
us
as
best
he
could
but
now
he
was
so
picturesque
so
much
nobler
really
than
he
had
been
in
his
healthier
uninjured
days
a
fabled
giant
he
seemed
to
me
composed
in
part
of
flesh
in
part
of
brick
and
stone
gazing
down
on
our
earthly
efforts
with
the
eye
of
a
come
now
get
the
from
aaf
the
end
there
take
the
bricks
away
from
that
man
ca
ye
see
there
where
his
head
is
there
there
jasus
christ
theyer
you
would
have
thought
we
were
italians
ourselves
poor
wisps
of
nothing
not
his
rescuers
but
slaves
compelled
to
do
his
lordly
bidding
after
a
time
however
we
managed
to
release
him
and
all
his
five
helpers
two
dead
as
i
say
and
matt
badly
cut
about
the
head
and
seriously
injured
while
jimmie
the
imperturbable
was
but
little
the
worse
for
a
brick
mark
on
one
shoulder
he
was
more
or
less
frightened
of
course
and
comic
to
look
at
even
in
this
dread
situation
smash
he
exclaimed
when
he
recovered
himself
da
worl
fall
misha
rook
misha
rook
where
misha
rook
here
i
am
ye
eyetalian
scalawag
exclaimed
the
unyielding
rourke
genially
who
was
still
partially
embedded
when
jimmie
was
released
there
was
however
a
touch
of
sorrow
in
his
voice
as
he
added
weakly
arre
ye
hurted
much
no
misha
rook
help
misha
rook
replied
jimmie
grabbing
at
bricks
himself
and
so
the
rescue
work
of
rook
went
on
finally
he
was
released
although
not
without
deprecating
our
efforts
the
while
this
wonderful
and
exceptional
fuss
over
him
and
exclaiming
at
one
point
as
we
tugged
at
joists
and
beams
rather
frantically
take
yer
time
take
yer
time
i
naht
so
bad
fixed
as
aall
that
take
yer
time
get
that
board
out
o
the
way
there
jimmie
but
he
was
badly
fixed
and
hurted
unto
death
also
as
we
now
found
and
as
he
insisted
he
was
not
his
hip
was
severely
crushed
by
the
timbers
and
his
legs
broken
as
well
as
his
internal
organs
disarranged
although
we
did
not
know
how
badly
at
the
time
only
after
we
had
removed
all
the
weight
did
he
collapse
and
perhaps
personally
realize
how
serious
was
his
plight
he
was
laid
on
a
canvas
tarpaulin
brought
by
the
and
spread
on
the
ground
while
the
doctors
from
two
ambulances
worked
over
him
while
they
were
examining
his
wounds
he
took
a
critical
and
quizzical
interest
in
what
they
were
doing
and
offered
one
or
two
humorous
suggestions
finally
when
they
were
ready
to
move
him
he
asked
how
he
was
and
on
being
told
that
he
was
all
right
looked
curiously
about
until
he
caught
my
eye
i
could
see
that
he
realized
how
critical
it
was
with
him
i
like
to
see
a
priest
teddy
he
whispered
and
if
ye
do
mind
i
like
ye
to
go
up
to
mount
vernon
an
tell
me
wife
they
be
after
telegraphin
her
if
ye
do
break
it
aisy
if
ye
will
do
let
think
there
anything
serious
there
no
need
av
it
i
naht
hurted
so
bad
as
aall
that
i
promised
and
the
next
moment
one
of
the
doctors
shot
a
spray
of
cocaine
into
his
hip
to
relieve
what
he
knew
must
be
his
dreadful
pain
a
few
moments
later
he
lost
consciousness
after
which
i
left
him
to
the
care
of
the
hospital
authorities
and
hurried
away
to
send
the
priest
and
to
tell
his
wife
for
a
week
thereafter
he
lingered
in
a
very
serious
condition
and
finally
died
having
set
in
i
saw
him
at
the
hospital
a
day
or
two
before
and
trying
to
sympathize
with
his
condition
i
frequently
spoke
of
what
i
deemed
the
dreadful
uncertainty
of
life
and
the
seeming
carelessness
of
the
engineer
in
charge
of
the
hoisting
engine
he
however
had
no
complaint
to
make
ye
must
expect
thim
things
was
his
only
comment
ye
ca
aalways
expect
to
go
unhurted
i
niver
lost
a
man
before
nor
had
one
come
to
haarm
is
the
way
av
things
ye
see
mighty
rourke
you
would
have
thought
the
whole
italian
population
of
mount
vernon
knew
and
loved
him
the
way
they
turned
out
at
his
funeral
it
was
a
state
affair
for
most
of
them
and
they
came
in
scores
packing
the
little
brick
church
at
which
he
was
accustomed
to
worship
full
to
overflowing
matt
was
there
bandaged
and
sore
but
sorrowful
and
jimmie
artful
and
scheming
in
the
past
but
now
thoroughly
subdued
he
was
all
sorrow
and
sniveled
and
blubbered
and
wept
hot
blinding
tears
through
the
dark
leathery
fingers
of
his
hands
misha
rook
misha
rook
i
heard
him
say
as
they
bore
the
body
in
and
when
they
carried
it
out
of
the
church
he
followed
head
down
as
they
lowered
it
to
the
grave
he
was
inconsolable
misha
rook
misha
rook
i
for
him
fifteen
year
mayor
and
his
here
is
the
story
of
an
individual
whose
political
and
social
example
if
such
things
are
ever
worth
anything
the
moralists
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
should
have
been
at
the
time
of
the
greatest
importance
to
every
citizen
of
the
united
states
only
it
was
not
or
was
it
who
really
knows
anyway
he
and
his
career
are
entirely
forgotten
by
now
and
have
been
these
many
years
he
was
the
mayor
of
one
of
those
dreary
new
england
mill
towns
in
northern
massachusetts
a
bleak
pleasureless
realm
of
about
forty
thousand
where
from
the
time
he
was
born
until
he
finally
left
at
the
age
of
to
seek
his
fortune
elsewhere
he
had
resided
without
change
during
that
time
he
had
worked
in
various
of
the
local
mills
which
in
one
way
and
another
involved
nearly
all
of
the
population
he
was
a
mill
by
trade
or
in
other
words
a
factory
knowing
only
a
part
of
all
the
processes
necessary
to
make
a
shoe
in
that
fashion
still
he
was
a
fair
workman
and
earned
as
much
as
fifteen
or
eighteen
dollars
a
week
at
times
rather
good
pay
for
that
region
by
temperament
a
humanitarian
or
possibly
because
of
his
own
humble
state
one
who
was
compelled
to
take
cognizance
of
the
difficulties
of
others
he
finally
expressed
his
mental
unrest
by
organizing
a
club
for
the
study
and
propagation
of
socialism
and
later
when
it
became
powerful
enough
to
have
a
candidate
and
look
for
political
expression
of
some
kind
he
was
its
first
and
thereafter
for
a
number
of
years
its
regular
candidate
for
mayor
for
a
long
time
or
until
its
membership
became
sufficient
to
attract
some
slight
political
attention
its
members
following
our
regular
american
unintellectual
custom
were
looked
upon
by
the
rest
of
the
people
as
a
body
of
harmless
kickers
filled
with
fool
notions
about
a
man
duty
to
his
fellowman
some
silly
dream
about
an
honest
and
economical
administration
of
public
affairs
their
city
affairs
to
be
exact
we
are
so
wise
in
america
so
interested
in
our
fellowman
so
regardful
of
his
welfare
they
were
so
small
in
number
however
that
they
were
little
more
than
an
object
of
pleasant
jest
useful
for
that
purpose
alone
this
club
however
continued
to
put
up
its
candidate
until
about
when
suddenly
it
succeeded
in
polling
the
very
modest
number
of
votes
double
the
number
it
had
succeeded
in
polling
any
previous
year
a
year
later
one
hundred
and
were
registered
and
the
next
year
six
hundred
then
suddenly
the
mayor
who
won
that
year
battle
died
and
a
special
election
was
called
here
the
club
polled
six
hundred
and
one
a
total
and
astonishing
gain
of
one
in
the
perennial
candidate
was
again
nominated
and
received
fifteen
hundred
and
in
when
he
ran
again
hundred
votes
which
elected
him
if
this
fact
be
registered
casually
here
it
was
not
so
regarded
in
that
typically
new
england
mill
town
ever
study
new
england
its
puritan
but
unintellectual
and
selfish
psychology
although
this
poor
little
snip
of
a
mayor
was
only
elected
for
one
year
men
paused
astounded
those
who
had
not
voted
for
him
and
several
of
the
older
conventional
political
and
religious
order
wedded
to
their
church
and
all
the
routine
of
the
average
puritanic
mill
town
actually
cried
no
one
knew
of
course
who
the
new
mayor
was
or
what
he
stood
for
there
were
open
assertions
that
the
club
behind
him
was
anarchistic
that
charge
against
anything
new
in
america
and
that
the
courts
should
be
called
upon
to
prevent
his
being
seated
and
this
from
people
who
were
as
poorly
off
commercially
and
socially
as
any
might
well
be
it
was
stated
as
proving
the
worst
that
he
was
or
had
been
a
mill
worker
and
before
that
a
grocery
clerk
both
at
twelve
a
week
or
less
immediate
division
of
property
the
forcing
of
all
employers
to
pay
as
much
as
five
a
day
to
every
laborer
an
sum
in
new
england
and
general
constraint
and
subversion
of
individual
rights
things
then
unknown
in
america
of
course
loomed
in
the
minds
of
these
conventional
americans
as
the
natural
and
immediate
result
of
so
modest
a
victory
the
politicians
and
corporations
who
understood
much
better
what
the
point
was
the
significance
of
this
straw
were
more
or
less
disgruntled
but
satisfied
that
it
could
be
undone
later
an
actual
conversation
which
occurred
on
one
of
the
outlying
street
corners
one
evening
about
dusk
will
best
illustrate
the
entire
situation
who
is
the
man
anyway
asked
one
citizen
of
a
total
stranger
whom
he
had
chanced
to
meet
oh
no
one
in
particular
i
think
a
grocery
clerk
they
say
astonishing
is
it
why
i
never
thought
those
people
would
get
anything
why
they
did
even
figure
last
year
seems
to
be
considerable
doubt
as
to
just
what
he
do
that
what
i
been
wondering
i
do
take
much
stock
in
all
their
talk
about
anarchy
a
man
has
so
very
much
power
as
mayor
no
said
the
other
we
ought
to
give
him
a
trial
anyway
he
won
a
big
fight
i
should
like
to
see
him
see
what
he
looks
like
oh
nothing
startling
i
know
him
rather
young
ai
he
yes
where
did
he
come
from
oh
right
around
here
was
he
a
yes
the
stranger
made
inquiry
as
to
other
facts
and
then
turned
off
at
a
corner
well
he
observed
at
parting
i
do
know
i
inclined
to
believe
in
the
man
i
should
like
to
see
him
myself
said
the
other
waving
his
hand
when
you
see
me
again
you
will
know
that
you
are
looking
at
the
mayor
the
inquirer
stared
after
him
and
saw
a
citizen
of
otherwise
medium
proportions
whose
long
youthful
face
and
mild
gray
eyes
with
just
a
suggestion
of
blue
in
them
were
hardly
what
was
to
be
expected
of
a
notorious
and
otherwise
astounding
political
figure
he
is
too
young
was
the
earliest
comments
when
the
public
once
became
aware
of
his
personality
why
he
is
nothing
but
a
grocery
clerk
was
another
the
skeptical
and
condemnatory
possibilities
of
which
need
not
be
dilated
upon
here
and
he
was
in
his
way
nothing
much
of
a
genius
as
such
things
go
in
politics
but
an
interesting
figure
without
much
taste
or
its
cultivated
shadow
or
great
vision
of
any
kind
he
was
still
a
man
who
sensed
the
evils
of
great
and
often
unnecessary
social
inequalities
and
the
need
of
reorganizing
influences
which
would
tend
to
narrow
the
vast
gulf
between
the
unorganized
and
ignorant
poor
and
the
huge
beneficiaries
of
unearned
yes
and
not
even
understood
increment
for
what
does
the
economic
wisdom
of
the
average
capitalist
amount
to
after
all
the
narrow
gourmandizing
hunger
of
the
average
at
any
rate
people
watched
him
as
he
went
to
and
fro
between
his
office
and
his
home
and
reached
the
general
conclusion
after
the
first
excitement
had
died
down
that
he
did
not
amount
to
much
when
introduced
into
his
office
in
the
small
but
pleasant
city
hall
he
came
into
contact
with
a
ring
and
a
fixed
condition
which
nobody
imagined
a
lone
young
mayor
could
change
politicians
sat
there
giving
out
contracts
for
lighting
improvements
and
supplies
of
all
kinds
and
a
bond
of
mutual
profit
bound
them
closely
together
i
do
think
he
can
do
much
to
hurt
us
these
individuals
said
one
to
another
he
do
amount
to
much
the
mayor
was
not
of
a
talkative
or
confiding
turn
neither
was
he
cold
or
wanting
in
good
and
natural
manners
he
was
however
of
a
preoccupied
turn
of
mind
up
in
the
air
some
called
it
and
smoked
a
good
many
cigars
i
think
we
ought
to
get
together
and
have
some
sort
of
a
conference
about
the
letting
of
contracts
said
the
president
of
the
city
council
to
him
one
morning
shortly
after
he
had
been
installed
you
will
find
these
gentlemen
ready
to
meet
you
in
these
matters
i
very
glad
to
hear
that
he
replied
i
something
to
say
in
my
message
to
the
council
which
i
send
over
in
the
morning
the
politician
eyed
him
curiously
and
he
eyed
the
politician
in
turn
not
aggressively
but
as
if
they
might
come
to
a
very
pleasant
understanding
if
they
wanted
to
and
then
went
back
to
his
office
the
next
day
his
message
was
made
public
and
this
was
its
all
contract
work
for
the
city
should
be
let
with
a
proviso
that
the
workmen
employed
receive
not
less
than
two
dollars
a
day
the
dissatisfied
roar
that
followed
was
not
long
in
making
itself
heard
all
over
the
city
stuff
and
nonsense
yelled
the
office
jobbers
in
a
chorus
socialism
anarchy
this
thing
must
be
put
down
the
city
would
be
bankrupt
in
a
year
no
contractor
could
afford
to
pay
his
ordinary
day
laborers
two
a
day
the
city
could
not
afford
to
pay
any
contractor
enough
to
do
it
the
prosperity
of
the
city
is
not
greater
than
the
prosperity
of
the
largest
number
of
its
component
individuals
replied
the
mayor
in
a
somewhat
altruistic
and
economically
abstruse
argument
on
the
floor
of
the
council
hall
we
must
find
contractors
we
see
about
that
said
the
members
of
the
opposition
why
the
man
crazy
if
he
thinks
he
can
run
this
town
on
a
basis
and
make
everybody
rich
and
happy
he
going
to
get
badly
fooled
all
there
is
to
that
fortunately
for
him
three
of
the
eight
council
members
were
fellows
of
the
mayor
own
economic
beliefs
individuals
elected
on
the
same
ticket
with
him
these
men
could
not
carry
a
resolution
but
they
could
stop
one
from
being
carried
over
the
mayor
veto
hence
it
was
found
that
if
the
contracts
could
not
be
given
to
men
satisfactory
to
the
mayor
they
could
not
be
given
at
all
and
he
stood
in
a
fair
way
to
win
what
the
hell
the
use
of
us
sitting
here
day
after
day
were
the
actual
words
of
the
leading
members
of
the
opposition
in
the
council
some
weeks
later
when
the
fight
became
wearisome
we
ca
pass
the
contracts
over
his
veto
i
say
let
go
so
the
proviso
was
tacked
on
that
two
a
day
was
the
minimum
wage
to
be
allowed
and
the
contracts
passed
the
mayor
followers
were
exceedingly
jubilant
at
this
more
so
than
he
who
was
of
a
more
cautious
and
less
hopeful
temperament
not
out
of
the
woods
yet
gentlemen
he
remarked
to
a
group
of
his
adherents
at
the
reform
club
we
have
to
do
a
great
many
things
sensibly
if
we
expect
to
keep
the
people
confidence
and
again
under
the
old
system
of
letting
contracts
whenever
there
was
a
wage
rate
stipulated
men
were
paid
little
or
nothing
and
the
work
was
not
done
there
was
no
pretense
of
doing
it
garbage
and
ashes
accumulated
and
papers
littered
the
streets
the
old
contractor
who
had
pocketed
the
appropriated
sum
thought
to
do
so
again
i
hear
the
citizens
are
complaining
as
much
as
ever
said
the
mayor
to
this
individual
one
morning
you
will
have
to
keep
the
streets
clean
the
contractor
a
robust
irishman
of
just
so
much
refinement
as
the
sudden
acquisition
of
a
comfortable
fortune
would
allow
looked
him
quizzically
over
wondering
whether
he
was
out
for
a
portion
of
the
appropriation
or
whether
he
was
really
serious
we
can
fix
that
between
us
he
said
there
nothing
to
fix
replied
the
mayor
all
i
want
you
to
do
is
to
clean
the
streets
the
contractor
went
away
and
for
a
few
days
after
the
streets
were
really
clean
but
it
was
only
for
a
few
days
in
his
walks
about
the
city
the
mayor
himself
found
garbage
and
paper
uncollected
and
then
called
upon
his
new
acquaintance
again
i
mentioning
this
for
the
last
time
m
he
said
you
will
have
to
fulfill
your
contract
or
resign
in
favor
of
some
one
who
will
oh
i
clean
them
well
enough
said
this
individual
after
five
minutes
of
rapid
fire
explanation
two
dollars
a
day
for
men
is
high
but
i
see
that
they
clean
again
he
went
away
and
again
the
mayor
sauntered
about
and
then
one
morning
sought
out
the
contractor
in
his
own
office
this
is
the
end
he
said
removing
a
cigar
from
his
mouth
and
holding
it
before
him
with
his
elbow
at
right
angles
you
are
discharged
from
this
work
i
notify
you
officially
it
ca
be
done
the
way
you
want
it
the
contractor
exclaimed
with
an
oath
there
no
money
in
it
at
two
dollars
hell
anybody
can
see
that
very
well
said
the
mayor
in
a
kindly
tone
let
another
man
try
then
the
next
day
he
appointed
a
new
contractor
and
with
a
schedule
before
him
showing
how
many
men
should
be
employed
and
how
much
profit
he
might
expect
the
latter
succeeded
the
garbage
was
daily
removed
and
the
streets
carefully
cleaned
then
there
was
a
new
manual
training
school
about
to
be
added
to
the
public
school
system
at
this
time
and
the
contract
for
building
was
to
be
let
when
the
mayor
threw
a
bomb
into
the
midst
of
the
jobbers
at
the
city
council
a
contractor
had
already
been
chosen
by
them
and
the
members
were
figuring
out
their
profits
when
at
one
of
the
public
discussions
of
the
subject
the
mayor
said
why
should
the
city
build
it
gentlemen
how
can
it
exclaimed
the
councilmen
the
city
is
an
individual
it
ca
watch
carefully
it
can
hire
its
own
architect
as
well
as
any
contractor
let
try
it
there
were
sullen
tempers
in
the
council
chamber
after
this
but
the
mayor
was
insistent
he
called
an
architect
who
made
a
ridiculously
low
estimate
never
had
a
public
building
been
estimated
so
cheaply
before
see
here
said
one
of
the
councilmen
when
the
plans
were
presented
to
the
chamber
this
is
doing
this
city
right
and
the
gentlemen
of
the
council
ought
to
put
their
feet
down
on
any
such
venture
as
this
going
to
waste
the
city
money
on
some
cheap
thing
in
order
to
catch
votes
i
publish
the
cost
of
the
goods
as
delivered
said
the
mayor
then
the
people
can
look
at
the
building
when
it
built
we
see
how
cheap
it
looks
then
to
head
off
political
trickery
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
he
secured
bills
for
material
as
delivered
and
publicly
compared
them
with
prices
paid
for
similar
amounts
of
the
same
material
used
in
other
buildings
so
the
public
was
kept
aware
of
what
was
going
on
and
the
cry
of
cheapness
for
political
purposes
set
at
naught
it
was
the
first
public
structure
erected
by
the
city
and
by
all
means
the
cheapest
and
best
of
all
the
city
buildings
excellent
as
these
services
were
in
their
way
the
mayor
realized
later
that
a
powerful
opposition
was
being
generated
and
that
if
he
were
to
retain
the
interest
of
his
constituents
he
would
have
to
set
about
something
which
would
endear
him
and
his
cause
to
the
public
i
may
be
honest
he
told
one
of
his
friends
but
honesty
will
play
a
lone
hand
with
these
people
the
public
is
interested
in
its
own
welfare
very
much
it
ca
be
bothered
or
has
the
time
what
i
need
is
something
that
will
impress
it
and
still
be
worth
while
i
ca
be
reëlected
on
promises
or
on
my
looks
either
when
he
looked
about
him
however
he
found
the
possibility
of
independent
municipal
action
pretty
well
hampered
by
mandatory
legislation
he
had
promised
for
instance
to
do
all
he
could
to
lower
the
exorbitant
gas
rate
and
to
abolish
grade
crossings
but
the
law
said
that
no
municipality
could
do
either
of
these
things
without
first
voting
to
do
so
three
years
in
succession
a
little
precaution
taken
by
the
corporation
representing
such
things
long
before
he
came
into
power
each
vote
must
be
for
such
contemplated
action
or
it
could
not
become
a
law
i
know
well
enough
that
promises
are
all
right
he
said
to
one
of
his
friends
and
that
these
laws
are
good
enough
excuses
but
the
public
wo
take
excuses
from
me
for
three
years
if
i
want
to
be
mayor
again
i
want
to
be
doing
something
and
doing
it
quick
in
the
city
was
a
gas
corporation
originally
capitalized
at
and
subsequently
increased
to
which
was
earning
that
year
the
actual
sum
of
over
and
above
all
expenses
it
was
getting
ready
to
inflate
the
capitalization
as
usual
and
water
its
stock
to
the
extent
of
when
it
occurred
to
the
mayor
that
if
the
corporation
was
making
such
enormous
profits
out
of
a
investment
as
to
be
able
to
offer
to
pay
six
per
cent
on
to
investors
and
put
the
money
it
would
get
for
such
stocks
into
its
pocket
perhaps
it
could
reduce
the
price
of
gas
from
one
dollar
and
nineteen
cents
to
a
more
reasonable
figure
there
was
the
three
years
voting
law
however
behind
which
as
behind
an
entrenchment
the
very
luxurious
corporation
lay
comfortable
and
indifferent
the
mayor
sent
for
his
corporation
counsel
and
studied
gas
law
for
awhile
he
found
that
at
the
state
capital
there
was
a
state
board
or
commission
which
had
been
created
to
look
after
gas
companies
in
general
and
to
hear
the
complaints
of
municipalities
which
considered
themselves
unjustly
treated
this
is
the
thing
for
me
he
said
lacking
the
municipal
authority
himself
he
decided
to
present
the
facts
in
the
case
and
appeal
to
this
commission
for
a
reduction
of
the
gas
rate
when
he
came
to
talk
about
it
he
found
that
the
opposition
he
would
generate
would
be
something
much
more
than
local
back
of
the
local
reduction
idea
was
the
whole
system
of
extortionate
gas
rates
of
the
state
and
of
the
nation
hundreds
of
fat
luxurious
gas
corporations
whose
dividends
would
be
threatened
by
any
agitation
on
this
question
you
mean
to
proceed
with
this
scheme
of
yours
asked
a
prominent
member
of
the
local
bar
who
called
one
morning
to
interview
him
i
represent
the
gentlemen
who
are
interested
in
our
local
gas
company
i
certainly
do
replied
the
mayor
well
replied
the
uncredentialed
representative
of
private
interests
after
expostulating
a
long
time
and
offering
various
reasons
why
it
would
be
more
profitable
and
politically
advantageous
for
the
new
mayor
not
to
proceed
i
said
all
i
can
say
now
i
want
to
tell
you
that
you
are
going
up
against
a
combination
that
will
be
your
ruin
not
dealing
with
this
town
now
you
dealing
with
the
state
the
whole
nation
these
corporations
ca
afford
to
let
you
win
and
they
wo
you
not
the
one
to
do
it
you
not
big
enough
the
mayor
smiled
and
replied
that
of
course
he
could
not
say
as
to
that
the
lawyer
went
away
and
that
next
day
the
mayor
had
his
legal
counsel
look
up
the
annual
reports
of
the
company
for
the
consecutive
years
of
its
existence
as
well
as
a
bulletin
issued
by
a
firm
of
brokers
into
whose
hands
the
matter
of
selling
a
vast
amount
of
watered
stock
it
proposed
to
issue
had
been
placed
he
also
sent
for
a
gas
expert
and
set
him
to
figuring
out
a
case
for
the
people
it
was
found
by
this
gentleman
that
since
the
company
was
first
organized
it
had
paid
dividends
on
its
capital
stock
at
the
rate
of
ten
per
cent
per
annum
for
the
first
thirty
years
had
made
vast
improvements
in
the
last
ten
and
notwithstanding
this
fact
had
paid
twenty
per
cent
and
even
per
cent
per
annum
in
dividends
all
the
details
of
cost
and
expenditure
were
figured
out
and
then
the
mayor
with
his
counsel
took
the
train
for
the
state
capitol
never
was
there
more
excitement
in
political
circles
than
when
this
young
representative
of
no
important
political
organization
whatsoever
arrived
at
the
state
capitol
and
walked
at
the
appointed
time
into
the
private
audience
room
of
the
commission
every
gas
company
as
well
as
every
newspaper
and
every
other
representative
of
the
people
had
curiously
enough
become
interested
in
the
fight
he
was
making
and
there
was
a
band
of
reporters
at
the
hotel
where
he
was
stopping
as
well
as
in
the
commission
chambers
in
the
state
capitol
where
the
hearing
was
to
be
they
wanted
to
know
about
him
why
he
was
doing
this
whether
it
was
a
strike
or
the
work
of
some
rival
corporation
the
fact
that
he
might
foolishly
be
sincere
was
hard
to
believe
gentlemen
said
the
mayor
as
he
took
his
stand
in
front
of
an
august
array
of
legal
talent
which
was
waiting
to
pick
his
argument
to
pieces
in
the
commission
chambers
at
the
capitol
i
miscalculated
but
one
thing
in
this
case
which
i
am
about
to
lay
before
you
and
that
is
the
extent
of
public
interest
i
came
here
prepared
to
make
a
private
argument
but
now
i
want
to
ask
the
privilege
of
making
it
public
i
see
the
public
itself
is
interested
or
should
be
i
will
ask
leave
to
postpone
my
argument
until
the
day
after
tomorrow
there
was
considerable
hemming
and
hawing
over
this
since
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
corporation
it
was
most
undesirable
but
the
commission
was
practically
powerless
to
do
aught
but
grant
his
request
and
meanwhile
the
interest
created
by
the
newspapers
added
power
to
his
cause
hunting
up
the
several
representatives
and
senators
from
his
district
he
compelled
them
to
take
cognizance
of
the
cause
for
which
he
was
battling
and
when
the
morning
of
the
public
hearing
arrived
a
large
audience
was
assembled
in
the
chamber
of
representatives
when
the
final
moment
arrived
the
young
mayor
came
forward
and
after
making
a
very
simple
statement
of
the
cause
which
led
him
to
request
a
public
hearing
and
the
local
condition
which
he
considered
unfair
begged
leave
to
introduce
an
expert
a
national
examiner
of
gas
plants
and
lighting
facilities
for
whom
he
had
sent
and
whose
twenty
years
of
experience
in
this
line
had
enabled
him
to
prepare
a
paper
on
the
condition
of
the
in
the
mayor
city
the
commission
was
not
a
little
surprised
by
this
but
signified
its
willingness
to
hear
the
expert
as
counsel
for
the
city
and
as
his
statement
was
read
a
very
clear
light
was
thrown
upon
the
situation
counsel
for
the
various
gas
corporations
interrupted
freely
the
mayor
himself
was
constantly
drawn
into
the
argument
but
his
replies
were
so
simple
and
convincing
that
there
was
not
much
satisfaction
to
be
had
in
stirring
him
instead
the
various
counsel
took
refuge
in
discussions
about
the
methods
of
conducting
gas
plants
in
other
cities
the
cost
of
machinery
labor
and
the
like
which
took
days
and
days
and
threatened
to
extend
into
weeks
the
astounding
facts
concerning
large
profits
and
the
present
intentions
of
not
only
this
but
every
other
company
in
the
state
could
not
be
dismissed
in
fact
the
revelation
of
huge
corporation
profits
everywhere
became
so
disturbing
that
after
the
committee
had
considered
and
it
finally
when
threatened
with
political
extermination
voted
to
reduce
the
price
of
gas
to
eighty
cents
it
is
needless
to
suggest
the
local
influence
of
this
decision
when
the
mayor
came
home
he
received
an
ovation
and
that
at
the
hands
of
many
of
the
people
who
had
once
been
so
fearful
of
him
but
he
knew
that
this
enthusiasm
would
not
last
long
many
disgruntled
elements
were
warring
against
him
and
others
were
being
more
and
more
stirred
up
his
home
life
was
looked
into
as
well
as
his
past
his
least
childish
or
private
actions
it
was
a
case
of
finding
other
opportunities
for
public
usefulness
or
falling
into
the
innocuous
peace
which
would
result
in
his
defeat
in
the
platform
on
which
he
had
been
elected
was
a
plank
which
declared
that
it
was
the
intention
of
this
party
if
elected
to
abolish
local
grade
crossings
the
maintenance
of
which
had
been
the
cause
of
numerous
accidents
and
much
public
complaint
with
this
plank
he
now
proposed
to
deal
in
this
of
course
he
was
hampered
by
the
law
before
mentioned
which
declared
that
no
city
could
abolish
its
grade
crossings
without
having
first
submitted
the
matter
to
the
people
during
three
successive
years
and
obtained
their
approval
each
time
behind
this
law
was
not
now
however
as
in
the
case
of
the
gas
company
a
small
corporation
but
all
the
railroads
which
controlled
new
england
and
to
which
brains
and
legislators
courts
and
juries
were
mere
adjuncts
furthermore
the
question
would
have
to
be
voted
on
at
the
same
time
as
his
candidacy
and
this
would
have
deterred
many
another
more
ambitious
politician
the
mayor
was
not
to
be
deterred
however
he
began
his
agitation
and
the
enemy
began
theirs
but
in
the
midst
of
what
seemed
to
be
a
fair
battle
the
great
railway
company
endeavored
to
steal
a
march
there
was
suddenly
and
secretly
introduced
into
the
lower
house
of
the
state
legislature
a
bill
which
in
deceptive
phraseology
declared
that
the
law
which
allowed
all
cities
by
three
successive
votes
to
abolish
grade
crossings
in
three
years
was
in
the
case
of
a
particular
city
mentioned
hereby
abrogated
for
a
term
of
four
years
the
question
might
not
even
be
discussed
politically
when
the
news
of
this
attempt
reached
the
mayor
he
took
the
first
train
for
the
state
capitol
and
arrived
there
just
in
time
to
come
upon
the
floor
of
the
house
when
the
bill
was
being
taken
up
for
discussion
he
asked
leave
to
make
a
statement
great
excitement
was
aroused
by
his
timely
arrival
those
who
secretly
favored
the
bill
endeavored
to
have
the
matter
referred
to
a
committee
but
this
was
not
to
be
one
member
moved
to
go
on
with
the
consideration
of
the
bill
and
after
a
close
vote
the
motion
carried
the
mayor
was
then
introduced
after
a
few
moments
in
which
the
silent
with
which
he
introduced
himself
impressed
everyone
with
his
sincerity
he
said
i
am
accused
of
objecting
to
this
measure
because
its
enactment
will
remove
as
a
political
issue
the
one
cause
upon
which
i
base
my
hope
for
reëlection
if
there
are
no
elevated
crossings
to
vote
for
there
will
be
no
excuse
for
voting
for
me
gentlemen
you
mistake
the
temper
and
the
intellect
of
the
people
of
our
city
it
is
you
who
see
political
significance
in
this
thing
but
let
me
assure
you
that
it
is
of
a
far
different
kind
from
that
which
you
conceive
if
the
passing
of
this
measure
had
any
significance
to
me
other
than
the
apparent
wrong
of
it
i
would
get
down
on
my
knees
and
urge
its
immediate
acceptance
nothing
could
elect
me
quicker
nothing
could
bury
the
opposition
further
from
view
if
you
wish
above
all
things
to
accomplish
my
triumph
you
will
only
need
to
interfere
with
the
rights
of
our
city
in
this
arbitrary
manner
and
you
will
have
the
thing
done
i
could
absolutely
ask
nothing
more
the
gentlemen
who
had
this
measure
in
charge
weighed
well
these
assertions
and
trifled
for
weeks
with
the
matter
trying
to
make
up
their
minds
meanwhile
election
time
approached
and
amid
the
growing
interest
of
politics
it
was
thought
unwise
to
deal
with
it
a
great
fight
was
arranged
for
locally
in
which
every
conceivable
element
of
opposition
was
beautifully
harmonized
by
forces
and
conceptions
which
it
is
almost
impossible
to
explain
democrats
republicans
prohibitionists
saloon
men
and
religious
circles
all
were
gathered
into
one
harmonious
body
and
inspired
with
a
single
idea
that
of
defeating
the
mayor
from
some
quarter
not
exactly
identified
was
issued
a
call
for
a
civic
committee
of
fifty
which
should
take
into
its
hands
the
duty
of
rescuing
the
city
from
what
was
termed
a
throttling
policy
of
commercial
oppression
and
anarchy
democrats
republicans
liquor
and
were
invited
to
the
same
central
meeting
place
and
came
money
was
not
lacking
nor
able
minds
to
prepare
campaign
literature
it
was
openly
charged
that
a
blank
check
was
handed
in
to
the
chairman
of
this
body
by
the
railway
whose
crossings
were
in
danger
to
be
filled
out
for
any
amount
necessary
to
the
destruction
of
the
official
upstart
who
was
seeking
to
revolutionize
old
methods
and
conditions
as
may
be
expected
this
opposition
did
not
lack
daring
in
making
assertions
contrary
to
facts
charges
were
now
made
that
the
mayor
was
in
league
with
the
railroad
to
foist
upon
the
city
a
great
burden
of
expense
because
the
law
under
which
cities
could
compel
railroads
to
elevate
their
tracks
declared
that
of
the
burden
of
expense
must
be
borne
by
the
city
and
the
remaining
by
the
railroad
it
would
saddle
a
debt
of
upon
the
taxpayers
they
said
and
give
them
little
in
return
all
the
advantage
would
be
with
the
railroad
postpone
this
action
until
the
railroad
can
be
forced
to
bear
the
entire
expense
as
it
justly
should
declared
handbill
writers
whose
services
were
readily
rendered
to
those
who
could
afford
to
pay
for
them
the
mayor
and
his
committee
although
poor
answered
with
handbills
and
street
corner
speeches
in
which
he
showed
that
even
with
the
extravagantly
estimated
debt
of
the
city
would
not
be
increased
by
quite
six
cents
to
the
individual
the
cry
that
each
man
would
have
to
pay
five
dollars
more
each
year
for
ten
years
was
thus
wholesomely
disposed
of
and
the
campaign
proceeded
now
came
every
conceivable
sort
of
charge
if
he
were
not
defeated
all
reputable
merchants
would
surely
leave
the
city
capital
was
certainly
being
scared
off
there
would
be
idle
factories
and
empty
stomachs
look
out
for
hard
times
no
one
but
a
fool
would
invest
in
a
city
thus
hampered
in
reply
the
mayor
preached
a
fair
return
by
corporations
for
benefits
received
he
or
rather
his
organization
took
a
census
of
his
following
and
discovered
a
very
considerable
increase
in
the
number
of
those
intending
to
vote
for
him
the
closest
calculations
of
the
enemy
were
discovered
the
actual
number
they
had
fixed
upon
as
sufficient
to
defeat
him
this
proved
to
the
mayor
that
he
must
have
three
hundred
more
votes
if
he
wished
to
be
absolutely
sure
these
he
hunted
out
from
among
the
enemy
and
had
them
pledged
before
the
eventual
morning
came
the
night
preceding
election
ended
the
campaign
for
the
enemy
at
least
in
a
blaze
of
glory
so
to
speak
dozens
of
speakers
for
both
causes
were
about
the
street
corners
and
in
the
city
meeting
room
oratory
poured
forth
in
streams
and
rattled
from
street
to
street
emitting
song
and
invective
even
a
great
parade
was
arranged
by
the
forces
in
which
horses
and
men
to
the
number
of
hundreds
were
brought
in
from
nearby
cities
and
palmed
off
as
enthusiastic
citizens
horses
do
vote
a
watchword
handed
out
by
the
mayor
took
the
edge
off
the
extreme
ardor
of
this
invading
throng
and
set
to
laughing
the
hundreds
of
his
partisans
who
needed
such
encouragement
next
day
came
the
vote
and
then
for
once
anyhow
he
was
justified
not
only
was
a
much
larger
vote
cast
than
ever
but
he
thrashed
the
enemy
with
a
tail
of
two
hundred
votes
to
spare
it
was
an
inspiring
victory
from
one
point
of
view
but
rather
doleful
for
the
enemy
the
latter
had
imported
a
carload
of
fireworks
which
now
stood
sadly
unused
upon
the
very
tracks
which
apparently
must
in
the
future
be
raised
the
crowning
insult
was
offered
when
the
successful
forces
offered
to
take
them
off
their
hands
at
half
price
for
a
year
thereafter
a
mayor
was
elected
yearly
there
less
was
heard
of
the
commercial
destruction
of
the
city
gas
stood
as
decided
at
eighty
cents
a
thousand
a
new
manual
training
school
built
at
a
very
nominal
cost
a
monument
to
municipal
honesty
was
also
in
evidence
the
public
waterworks
had
also
been
enlarged
and
the
rates
reduced
the
streets
were
clean
then
the
mayor
made
another
innovation
during
his
first
term
of
office
there
had
been
a
weekly
meeting
of
the
reform
club
at
which
he
appeared
and
talked
freely
of
his
plans
and
difficulties
these
meetings
he
now
proposed
to
make
public
every
wednesday
evening
for
a
year
thereafter
a
spectacle
of
municipal
was
witnessed
which
those
who
saw
it
felt
sure
would
redound
to
the
greater
strength
and
popularity
of
the
mayor
in
a
large
hall
devoted
to
public
gatherings
a
municipal
meeting
was
held
every
one
was
invited
the
mayor
was
both
host
and
guest
an
individual
who
chose
to
explain
his
conduct
and
his
difficulties
and
to
ask
advice
there
his
constituents
gathered
not
only
to
hear
but
to
offer
counsel
gentlemen
so
ran
the
gist
of
his
remarks
on
various
of
these
occasions
the
present
week
has
proved
a
most
trying
one
i
am
confronted
by
a
number
of
difficult
problems
which
i
will
now
try
to
explain
to
you
in
the
first
place
you
know
my
limitations
as
to
power
in
the
council
but
three
members
now
vote
for
me
and
it
is
only
by
mutual
concessions
that
we
move
forward
at
all
then
would
follow
a
detailed
statement
of
the
difficulties
and
a
general
discussion
the
commonest
laborer
was
free
to
offer
his
advice
every
question
was
answered
in
the
broadest
spirit
of
fellowship
an
inquiry
as
to
what
to
do
frequently
brought
the
most
helpful
advice
weak
and
impossible
solutions
were
met
as
such
and
shown
to
be
what
they
were
radicals
were
assuaged
conservatives
urged
forward
the
whole
political
situation
was
so
detailed
and
explained
that
no
intelligent
person
could
leave
it
was
thought
with
a
false
impression
of
the
mayor
position
or
intent
with
five
thousand
or
more
such
associated
citizens
abroad
each
day
explaining
defending
approving
the
official
conduct
of
the
mayor
because
they
understood
it
no
misleading
conceptions
it
was
thought
could
arise
men
said
that
his
purpose
and
current
leaning
in
any
matter
was
always
clear
he
was
thought
to
be
closer
to
his
constituency
than
any
other
official
within
the
whole
range
of
the
americas
and
that
there
could
be
nothing
but
unreasoning
partisan
opposition
to
his
rule
after
one
year
of
such
service
a
presidential
campaign
drew
near
and
the
mayor
campaign
for
reëlection
had
to
be
contested
at
the
same
time
no
gas
monopoly
evil
was
now
a
subject
of
contention
streets
were
clean
contracts
fairly
executed
the
general
municipal
interests
as
satisfactorily
attended
to
as
could
be
expected
only
the
grade
crossing
war
remained
as
an
issue
and
that
would
require
still
another
vote
after
this
his
record
was
the
only
available
campaign
argument
on
the
other
side
however
were
the
two
organizations
of
the
locally
defeated
great
parties
and
the
railroad
the
latter
insistent
in
its
bitterness
now
organized
these
two
bodies
into
a
powerful
opposition
newspapers
were
subsidized
the
national
significance
of
the
campaign
magnified
a
large
number
of
colonized
when
the
final
weeks
of
the
campaign
arrived
a
bitter
contest
was
waged
and
money
triumphed
five
thousand
four
hundred
votes
were
cast
for
the
mayor
five
thousand
four
hundred
and
fifty
for
the
opposing
candidate
who
was
of
the
same
party
as
the
successful
presidential
nominee
it
was
a
bitter
blow
but
still
one
easily
borne
by
the
mayor
who
was
considerable
of
a
philosopher
with
simple
undisturbed
grace
he
retired
and
three
days
later
applied
to
one
of
the
principal
shoe
factories
for
work
at
his
trade
what
you
not
looking
for
a
job
are
you
exclaimed
the
astonished
foreman
i
am
said
the
mayor
you
can
go
to
work
all
right
but
i
should
think
you
could
get
into
something
better
now
i
suppose
i
can
later
he
replied
when
i
complete
my
law
studies
just
now
i
want
to
do
this
for
a
change
to
see
how
things
are
with
the
rank
and
file
and
donning
the
apron
he
had
brought
with
him
he
went
to
work
it
was
not
long
however
before
he
was
discharged
largely
because
of
partisan
influence
anxious
to
drive
him
out
of
that
region
it
was
said
that
this
move
of
seeking
a
job
in
so
simple
a
way
was
a
bit
of
grand
standing
insincere
that
he
did
need
to
do
it
and
that
he
was
trying
to
pile
up
political
capital
against
the
future
a
little
later
a
local
grocery
man
of
his
social
faith
offered
him
a
position
as
clerk
and
for
some
odd
reason
humanitarian
and
sectarian
possibly
he
accepted
this
at
any
rate
here
he
labored
for
a
little
while
again
many
said
he
was
attempting
to
make
political
capital
out
of
this
simple
life
in
order
to
further
his
political
interests
later
and
this
possibly
even
probably
was
true
all
men
have
methods
of
fighting
for
that
which
they
believe
so
here
he
worked
for
a
time
while
a
large
number
of
agencies
pro
and
con
continued
to
denounce
or
praise
him
to
ridicule
or
extol
his
jeffersonian
simplicity
it
was
at
this
time
that
i
encountered
him
a
tall
spare
capable
and
interesting
individual
who
willingly
took
me
into
his
confidence
and
explained
all
that
had
hitherto
befallen
him
he
was
most
interesting
really
a
figure
to
commemorate
in
this
fashion
in
one
of
the
rooms
of
his
very
humble
home
a
kind
of
office
or
den
in
a
small
house
such
as
any
clerk
or
might
occupy
was
a
collection
of
clippings
laudatory
inquiring
and
abusive
which
would
have
done
credit
to
a
candidate
for
the
highest
office
in
the
land
one
would
have
judged
by
the
and
envelopes
stuffed
to
overflowing
with
long
newspaper
articles
and
editorials
that
had
been
cut
from
papers
all
over
the
country
from
florida
to
oregon
that
his
every
movement
at
this
time
and
earlier
was
to
the
people
plainly
he
had
been
watched
spied
upon
and
ignored
by
one
class
while
being
hailed
praised
and
invited
by
another
magazine
editors
had
called
upon
him
for
contributions
journalists
from
the
large
cities
had
sought
him
out
to
obtain
his
actual
views
citizens
leagues
in
various
parts
of
the
nation
had
invited
him
to
come
and
speak
and
yet
he
was
still
a
very
young
man
in
years
not
politically
or
philosophically
the
of
a
small
city
and
the
representative
of
no
great
organization
of
any
sort
in
his
retirement
he
was
now
comforted
if
one
can
be
so
comforted
by
these
memories
still
fresh
in
his
mind
and
by
the
hope
possibly
for
his
own
future
as
well
as
by
a
droll
humor
with
which
he
was
wont
to
select
the
sharpest
and
most
willful
slur
upon
his
unimpeachable
conduct
as
an
offering
to
public
curiosity
do
you
really
want
to
know
what
people
think
of
me
he
said
to
me
on
one
occasion
well
here
something
read
this
and
then
he
would
hand
me
a
bunch
of
the
bitterest
attacks
possible
attacks
which
pictured
him
as
a
sly
and
treacherous
enemy
of
the
people
or
worse
yet
a
bounding
anarchistic
ignoramus
personally
i
could
not
help
admiring
his
stoic
mood
it
was
superior
to
that
of
his
detractors
apparent
falsehoods
did
not
anger
him
evident
misunderstandings
could
not
seemingly
disturb
him
what
do
you
expect
he
once
said
to
me
after
i
had
made
a
very
careful
study
of
his
career
for
a
current
magazine
which
curiously
was
never
published
i
was
trying
to
get
him
to
admit
that
he
believed
that
his
example
might
be
fruitful
of
results
agreeable
to
him
in
the
future
i
could
not
conclude
that
he
really
agreed
with
me
people
do
not
remember
they
forget
they
remember
so
long
as
you
are
directly
before
them
with
something
that
interests
them
that
may
be
a
lower
or
a
band
that
plays
good
music
people
like
strong
people
and
only
strong
people
characters
of
that
sort
good
bad
or
indifferent
i
found
that
out
if
a
man
or
a
corporation
is
stronger
than
i
am
comes
along
and
denounces
me
or
spends
more
money
than
i
do
or
can
buys
more
beers
makes
larger
promises
it
is
day
for
me
what
has
happened
in
my
case
is
that
for
the
present
anyhow
i
have
come
up
against
a
strong
corporation
stronger
than
i
am
what
i
now
need
to
do
is
to
go
out
somewhere
and
get
some
more
strength
in
some
way
it
does
matter
much
how
people
are
not
so
much
interested
in
me
or
you
or
your
or
my
ideals
in
their
behalf
as
they
are
in
strength
an
interesting
spectacle
and
they
are
easily
deceived
these
big
fighting
corporations
with
their
attorneys
and
politicians
and
newspapers
make
me
look
weak
puny
so
the
people
forget
me
if
i
could
get
out
raise
one
million
or
five
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
give
the
corporations
a
good
drubbing
they
would
adore
me
for
awhile
then
i
would
have
to
go
out
and
get
another
five
hundred
thousand
somewhere
or
do
something
else
quite
so
i
replied
yet
populi
vox
sitting
upon
his
own
doorstep
one
evening
in
a
very
modest
quarter
of
the
city
i
said
were
you
very
much
depressed
by
your
defeat
the
last
time
not
at
all
he
replied
action
reaction
that
the
law
all
these
things
right
themselves
in
time
i
suppose
or
anyhow
they
ought
to
maybe
they
do
some
man
who
can
hand
the
people
what
they
really
need
or
ought
to
have
will
triumph
i
suppose
some
time
i
do
know
sure
i
hope
so
i
think
the
world
is
moving
on
all
right
in
his
serene
and
youthful
face
the
pale
blue
philosophical
eyes
was
no
evidence
of
dissatisfaction
with
the
strange
experiences
through
which
he
had
passed
you
entirely
philosophical
are
you
as
much
as
any
one
can
be
i
suppose
they
seem
to
think
that
all
my
work
was
an
evidence
of
my
worthlessness
he
said
well
maybe
it
was
may
be
the
true
law
and
the
best
force
i
have
quite
made
up
my
mind
yet
my
sympathies
of
course
are
all
the
other
way
ought
to
be
sewing
shoes
in
the
penitentiary
one
paper
once
said
of
me
another
advised
me
to
try
something
that
was
not
above
my
intelligence
such
as
breaking
rock
or
shoveling
dirt
most
of
them
agreed
however
he
added
with
a
humorous
twitch
of
his
large
expressive
mouth
that
i
do
very
well
if
i
will
only
stay
where
i
am
or
better
yet
get
out
of
here
they
want
me
to
leave
that
the
best
solution
for
them
he
seemed
to
repress
a
smile
that
was
hovering
on
his
lips
the
voice
of
the
enemy
i
commented
yes
sir
the
voice
of
the
enemy
he
added
but
do
think
that
i
think
i
done
for
not
at
all
i
have
just
returned
to
my
old
ways
in
order
to
think
this
thing
out
in
a
year
or
two
i
have
solved
my
problem
i
hope
i
may
have
to
leave
here
and
i
may
not
anyhow
turn
up
somewhere
with
something
he
did
have
to
leave
however
public
opinion
never
being
allowed
to
revert
to
him
again
and
five
years
later
in
a
fairly
comfortable
managerial
position
in
new
york
he
died
he
had
made
a
fight
well
enough
but
the
time
the
place
the
stars
perhaps
were
not
quite
right
he
had
no
guiding
genius
possibly
to
pull
him
through
adherents
did
not
flock
to
him
and
save
him
possibly
he
was
magnetic
enough
that
pagan
quality
anyhow
the
fates
did
not
fight
for
him
as
they
do
for
some
those
fates
that
ignore
the
billions
and
billions
of
others
who
fail
yet
are
not
all
lives
more
or
less
failures
however
successful
they
may
appear
to
be
at
one
time
or
another
contrasted
let
us
say
with
what
they
hoped
for
we
compromise
so
much
with
everything
our
dreams
and
all
as
for
his
reforms
they
may
be
coming
fast
enough
or
they
may
not
medias
but
as
for
him
life
little
ironies
are
not
always
manifest
we
hear
distant
rumbling
sounds
of
its
tragedies
but
rarely
are
we
permitted
to
witness
the
reality
therefore
the
real
incidents
which
i
am
about
to
relate
may
have
some
value
i
first
called
upon
s
in
the
winter
of
i
had
known
of
him
before
only
by
reputation
or
what
is
nearer
the
truth
by
seeing
his
name
in
one
of
the
great
sunday
papers
attached
to
several
drawings
of
the
most
lively
interest
these
drawings
depicted
night
scenes
of
the
city
of
new
york
and
appeared
as
colored
supplements
eleven
by
eighteen
inches
they
represented
the
spectacular
scenes
which
the
citizen
and
the
stranger
most
delight
in
madison
square
in
a
drizzle
the
bowery
lighted
by
a
thousand
lamps
and
crowded
with
l
and
surface
cars
sixth
avenue
looking
north
from
fourteenth
street
i
was
a
youthful
editor
at
the
time
and
on
the
lookout
for
interesting
illustrations
of
this
sort
and
when
a
little
later
i
was
in
need
of
a
colored
supplement
for
the
christmas
number
i
decided
to
call
upon
s
i
knew
absolutely
nothing
about
the
world
of
art
save
what
i
had
gathered
from
books
and
current
literary
comment
of
all
sorts
and
was
therefore
in
a
mood
to
behold
something
exceedingly
bizarre
in
the
atmosphere
with
which
i
should
find
my
illustrator
surrounded
i
was
not
disappointed
it
was
at
the
time
when
artists
i
mean
american
artists
principally
went
in
very
strongly
for
that
sort
of
thing
only
a
few
years
before
they
had
all
been
going
to
paris
not
so
much
to
paint
as
to
find
out
and
imitate
how
artists
and
live
i
was
greeted
by
a
small
wiry
individual
arrayed
in
a
bicycle
suit
whose
countenance
could
be
best
described
as
wearing
a
perpetual
look
of
astonishment
he
had
one
eye
which
fixed
you
with
a
strange
unmoving
solemnity
owing
to
the
fact
that
it
was
glass
his
skin
was
anything
but
fair
and
might
be
termed
sallow
he
wore
a
close
vandyke
beard
and
his
glasses
sat
at
almost
right
angles
upon
his
nose
his
forehead
was
high
his
good
eye
alert
his
hair
and
tousled
and
his
whole
manner
indicated
thought
feeling
remarkable
nervous
energy
and
above
all
a
rasping
and
jovial
sort
of
egotism
which
pleased
me
rather
than
otherwise
i
noticed
no
more
than
this
on
my
first
visit
owing
to
the
fact
that
i
was
very
much
overawed
and
greatly
concerned
about
the
price
which
he
would
charge
me
not
knowing
what
rate
he
might
wish
to
exact
and
being
desirous
of
coming
away
at
least
unabashed
by
his
magnificence
and
independence
what
it
for
he
asked
when
i
suggested
a
drawing
i
informed
him
you
say
you
want
it
for
a
center
yes
well
i
do
it
for
three
hundred
dollars
i
was
taken
considerably
aback
as
i
had
not
contemplated
paying
more
than
one
hundred
i
get
that
from
all
the
magazines
he
added
seeing
my
hesitation
wherever
a
supplement
is
intended
i
do
think
i
could
pay
more
than
one
hundred
i
said
after
a
few
moments
consideration
you
could
he
said
sharply
as
if
about
to
reprove
me
i
shook
my
head
well
he
said
let
see
a
copy
of
your
publication
the
chief
value
of
this
conversation
was
that
it
taught
me
that
the
man
manner
was
no
indication
of
his
mood
i
had
thought
he
was
impatient
and
indifferent
but
i
saw
now
that
he
was
not
so
rather
brusque
merely
he
was
simply
excitable
somewhat
like
the
french
and
meant
only
to
be
businesslike
the
upshot
of
it
all
was
that
he
agreed
to
do
it
for
one
hundred
and
fifty
and
asked
me
very
solemnly
to
say
nothing
about
it
i
may
say
here
that
i
came
upon
s
in
the
full
blush
of
his
fancies
and
ambitions
and
just
when
he
was
verging
upon
their
realization
he
was
not
yet
successful
a
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
was
a
very
fair
price
indeed
his
powers
however
had
reached
that
stage
where
they
would
soon
command
their
full
value
i
could
see
at
once
that
he
was
very
ambitious
he
was
bubbling
over
with
the
enthusiasm
of
youth
and
an
intense
desire
for
recognition
he
knew
he
had
talent
the
knowledge
of
it
gave
him
an
air
and
an
independence
of
manner
which
might
have
been
irritating
to
some
besides
he
was
slightly
affected
argue
to
the
contrary
as
he
would
and
was
altogether
full
of
his
own
hopes
and
ambitions
the
matter
of
painting
this
picture
necessitated
my
presence
on
several
occasions
and
during
this
time
i
got
better
acquainted
with
him
certain
ideas
and
desires
which
we
held
in
common
drew
us
toward
each
other
and
i
soon
began
to
see
that
he
was
much
above
the
average
in
insight
and
skill
he
talked
with
the
greatest
ease
upon
a
score
of
subjects
literature
art
politics
music
the
drama
and
history
he
seemed
to
have
read
the
latest
novels
to
have
seen
many
of
the
current
plays
to
have
talked
with
important
people
theodore
roosevelt
previously
police
commissioner
but
then
governor
often
came
to
his
studio
to
talk
and
play
chess
with
him
a
very
able
architect
was
his
friend
he
had
artist
associates
galore
many
of
whom
had
studios
in
the
same
building
or
the
immediate
vicinity
and
there
were
literary
and
business
men
as
well
all
of
whom
seemed
to
enjoy
his
company
and
who
were
very
fond
of
calling
and
spending
an
hour
in
his
studio
i
had
only
called
the
second
time
and
was
going
away
when
he
showed
me
a
steamship
he
had
constructed
with
his
own
hands
a
model
complete
in
every
detail
even
to
the
imitation
stokers
in
the
and
which
would
run
by
the
hour
if
supplied
with
oil
and
water
i
soon
learned
that
his
skill
in
mechanical
construction
was
great
he
was
a
member
of
several
engineering
societies
and
devoted
some
part
of
his
carefully
organized
days
to
studying
and
keeping
up
with
problems
in
mechanics
oh
that
nothing
he
observed
when
i
marveled
at
the
size
and
perfection
of
the
model
i
show
you
something
else
if
you
have
time
some
day
which
may
amuse
you
he
then
explained
that
he
had
constructed
several
model
warships
and
that
it
was
his
pleasure
to
take
them
out
and
fight
them
on
a
pond
somewhere
out
on
long
island
we
go
out
some
day
he
said
when
i
showed
appropriate
interest
and
have
them
fight
each
other
you
see
how
it
done
i
waited
some
time
for
this
outing
and
finally
mentioned
it
we
go
tomorrow
he
said
can
you
be
around
here
by
ten
ten
the
next
morning
saw
me
promptly
at
the
studio
and
five
minutes
later
we
were
off
when
we
arrived
at
long
island
city
we
went
to
the
first
convenient
arm
of
the
sea
and
undid
the
precious
fighters
in
which
he
much
delighted
after
studying
the
contour
of
the
little
inlet
for
a
few
moments
he
took
some
measurements
with
a
stuck
up
two
twigs
in
two
places
for
guide
posts
and
proceeded
to
fire
and
get
up
steam
in
his
afterwards
he
set
the
rudders
and
then
took
them
to
the
and
floated
them
at
the
points
where
he
had
placed
the
twigs
these
few
details
accomplished
he
again
studied
the
situation
carefully
headed
the
vessels
to
the
fraction
of
an
inch
toward
a
certain
point
of
the
opposite
shore
and
began
testing
the
steam
when
i
say
ready
you
push
this
lever
here
he
said
indicating
a
little
brass
handle
fastened
to
the
do
let
her
move
an
inch
until
you
do
that
you
see
some
tall
firing
he
hastened
to
the
other
side
where
his
own
boat
was
anchored
and
began
an
excited
examination
he
was
like
a
with
a
fine
toy
at
a
word
i
moved
the
lever
as
requested
and
the
two
vessels
began
steaming
out
toward
one
another
their
weight
and
speed
were
such
that
the
light
wind
blowing
affected
them
not
in
the
least
and
their
prows
struck
with
an
audible
crack
this
threw
them
side
by
side
steaming
head
on
together
at
the
same
time
it
operated
to
set
in
motion
their
guns
which
fired
broadsides
in
such
rapid
succession
as
to
give
a
suggestion
of
rapid
revolver
practice
quite
a
smoke
rose
and
when
it
rolled
away
one
of
the
vessels
was
already
nearly
under
water
and
the
other
was
keeling
with
the
inflow
of
water
from
the
port
side
s
lost
no
time
but
throwing
off
his
coat
jumped
in
and
swam
to
the
rescue
throughout
this
entire
incident
his
manner
was
that
of
an
enthusiastic
boy
who
had
something
exceedingly
novel
he
did
not
laugh
in
all
our
acquaintance
i
never
once
heard
him
give
a
sound
hearty
laugh
instead
he
cackled
his
delight
apparently
could
only
express
itself
in
that
way
in
the
main
it
showed
itself
in
an
excess
of
sharp
movements
short
verbal
expressions
gleams
of
the
eye
i
saw
from
this
the
man
delight
in
the
science
of
engineering
and
humored
him
in
it
he
was
thereafter
at
the
greatest
pains
to
show
all
that
he
had
under
way
in
the
mechanical
line
and
schemes
he
had
for
enjoying
himself
in
this
work
in
the
future
it
seemed
rather
a
recreation
for
him
than
anything
else
like
him
i
could
not
help
delighting
in
the
perfect
toys
which
he
created
but
the
intricate
details
and
slow
process
of
manufacture
were
for
not
only
would
he
draw
the
engine
in
all
its
parts
but
he
would
buy
the
raw
material
and
cast
and
drill
and
polish
each
separate
part
upon
my
second
visit
i
was
deeply
impressed
by
the
sight
of
a
fine
passenger
engine
a
duplicate
of
the
great
of
the
new
york
central
of
those
days
it
stood
on
brass
rails
laid
along
an
old
library
shelf
that
had
probably
belonged
to
the
previous
occupant
of
the
studio
this
engine
was
a
splendid
object
to
look
upon
strong
heavy
with
the
fineness
and
grace
of
a
perfect
it
was
duly
trimmed
with
brass
and
nickel
after
the
manner
of
the
great
flyers
and
seemed
so
sturdy
and
powerful
that
one
could
not
restrain
the
desire
to
see
it
run
how
do
you
like
that
s
exclaimed
when
he
saw
me
looking
at
it
it
splendid
i
said
see
how
she
runs
he
exclaimed
moving
it
up
and
down
no
noise
about
that
he
fairly
caressed
the
mechanism
with
his
hand
and
went
off
into
a
most
careful
analysis
of
its
qualities
i
could
build
that
engine
he
exclaimed
at
last
enthusiastically
if
i
were
down
in
the
baldwin
company
place
i
could
make
her
break
the
record
i
have
the
slightest
doubt
in
the
world
i
answered
this
engine
was
a
source
of
great
expense
to
him
as
well
as
the
chief
point
in
a
fine
scheme
he
had
made
brass
rails
for
it
sufficient
to
extend
about
the
four
sides
of
the
studio
something
like
seventy
feet
he
had
made
most
handsome
with
full
equipment
of
brakes
vestibules
pintsch
gas
and
so
on
and
had
painted
on
their
sides
the
great
pullman
line
one
day
when
we
were
quite
friendly
he
brought
from
his
home
all
the
rails
in
a
and
gave
an
exhibition
of
his
engine
speed
attaching
the
cars
and
getting
up
sufficient
steam
to
cause
the
engine
to
race
about
the
room
at
a
rate
which
was
actually
exciting
he
had
an
arrangement
by
which
it
would
pick
up
water
and
stop
automatically
it
was
on
this
occasion
that
he
confided
what
he
called
his
great
biograph
scheme
the
then
forerunner
of
the
latter
day
moving
pictures
it
was
all
so
new
then
almost
a
rumor
like
that
of
the
flying
machine
before
it
was
invented
i
propose
to
let
the
people
see
the
photographic
representation
of
an
actual
wreck
engine
cars
people
all
tumbled
down
together
after
a
collision
and
no
imitation
either
the
actual
thing
how
do
you
propose
to
do
it
i
asked
well
that
the
thing
he
said
banteringly
now
how
do
you
suppose
i
do
it
hire
a
railroad
to
have
a
wreck
and
kill
a
few
people
i
suggested
well
i
got
a
better
thing
than
that
a
railroad
could
plan
anything
more
real
than
mine
will
be
i
was
intensely
curious
because
of
the
novelty
of
the
thing
at
that
time
the
biograph
was
in
its
infancy
this
is
it
he
exclaimed
suddenly
you
see
how
realistic
this
engine
is
do
you
i
acknowledged
that
i
did
well
he
confided
i
building
another
just
like
it
it
costing
me
three
hundred
dollars
and
the
will
cost
as
much
more
now
i
going
to
fix
up
some
scenery
on
my
roof
a
gorge
a
line
of
woods
a
river
and
a
bridge
i
going
to
make
the
water
tumble
over
big
rocks
just
above
the
bridge
and
run
underneath
it
then
i
going
to
lay
this
track
around
these
rocks
through
the
woods
across
the
bridge
and
off
into
the
woods
again
i
going
to
put
on
the
two
trains
and
time
them
so
they
meet
on
the
bridge
just
when
they
come
into
view
where
they
can
see
each
other
a
post
on
the
side
of
the
track
will
strike
the
cabs
in
such
a
way
as
to
throw
the
firemen
out
on
the
steps
just
as
if
they
were
going
to
jump
when
the
engines
take
the
bridge
they
explode
caps
that
will
set
fire
to
oil
and
powder
under
the
cars
and
burn
them
up
then
what
i
asked
well
i
got
it
planned
automatically
so
that
you
will
see
people
jumping
out
of
the
cars
and
tumbling
down
on
the
rocks
the
flames
springing
up
and
taking
to
the
cars
and
all
that
do
you
believe
it
he
added
as
i
smiled
at
the
idea
look
here
and
he
produced
a
model
of
one
of
the
occupants
of
the
cars
he
labored
for
an
hour
to
show
all
the
intricate
details
until
i
was
compelled
to
admit
the
practicability
and
novelty
of
the
idea
then
he
explained
that
instantaneous
photography
as
it
was
then
called
was
to
be
applied
at
such
close
range
that
the
picture
would
appear
life
size
the
actuality
of
the
occurrence
would
do
the
rest
skepticism
still
lingered
with
me
for
a
time
but
when
i
saw
the
second
train
growing
the
figures
and
apparatus
gradually
being
modeled
and
the
correspondence
and
conferences
going
on
between
the
artist
and
several
companies
which
wished
to
gain
control
of
the
result
i
was
perfectly
sure
that
his
idea
would
some
day
be
realized
as
i
have
said
when
i
first
met
s
he
had
not
realized
any
of
his
dreams
it
was
just
at
that
moment
that
the
tide
was
about
to
turn
he
surprised
me
by
the
assurance
born
of
his
wonderful
virility
with
which
he
went
about
all
things
i
got
an
order
from
the
home
he
said
to
me
one
day
they
came
to
me
good
i
said
what
is
it
somebody
writing
up
the
terminal
facilities
of
new
york
he
had
before
him
an
academy
board
on
which
was
sketched
in
wash
a
midnight
express
striking
out
across
the
jersey
meadows
with
sparks
blazing
from
the
smoke
stacks
and
dim
lights
burning
in
the
sleepers
it
was
a
vivid
thing
strong
with
all
the
strength
of
an
engine
and
rich
in
the
go
and
enthusiasm
which
adhere
to
such
mechanisms
i
want
to
make
a
good
thing
of
this
he
said
it
may
do
me
some
good
a
little
later
he
received
his
first
order
from
harper
he
could
not
disguise
that
he
was
pleased
much
as
he
tried
to
carry
it
off
with
an
air
it
was
just
before
the
spanish
war
broke
out
and
the
sketches
he
was
to
do
related
to
the
navy
he
labored
at
this
order
with
the
most
tireless
enthusiasm
marine
construction
was
his
delight
anyhow
and
he
spent
hours
and
days
making
studies
about
the
great
vessels
getting
not
only
the
atmosphere
but
the
mechanical
detail
when
he
made
the
pictures
they
represented
all
that
he
felt
you
know
those
drawings
he
said
the
day
after
he
delivered
them
yes
i
set
a
good
stiff
price
on
them
and
demanded
my
drawings
back
when
they
were
through
did
you
get
them
yep
it
will
give
them
more
respect
for
what
i
trying
to
do
he
said
not
long
after
he
illustrated
one
of
kipling
stories
he
was
in
high
feather
at
this
but
grim
and
repressed
withal
one
could
see
by
the
nervous
movements
of
his
wiry
body
that
he
was
delighted
over
it
at
this
time
kipling
came
to
his
studio
it
was
by
special
arrangement
but
s
received
him
as
if
he
were
well
as
artists
usually
receive
authors
they
talked
over
the
galley
proofs
and
the
author
went
away
it
coming
my
way
now
he
said
when
he
could
no
longer
conceal
his
feelings
i
want
to
do
something
good
on
this
through
all
this
rise
from
obscurity
to
recognition
he
lived
close
to
his
friends
a
crowd
of
them
apparently
always
in
his
studio
jesting
boxing
fencing
and
interested
himself
in
the
mechanics
i
have
described
his
drawing
his
his
literary
studies
and
recreations
were
all
mixed
jumbled
plunging
him
as
it
were
on
to
distinction
in
the
first
six
months
of
his
studio
life
he
had
learned
to
fence
and
often
dropped
his
brush
to
put
on
the
mask
and
assume
the
foils
with
one
of
his
companions
as
our
friendship
increased
i
found
how
many
were
the
accomplishments
and
how
wide
his
range
of
sympathies
he
was
an
expert
bicyclist
as
well
as
a
trick
rider
and
used
a
camera
in
a
way
to
make
an
amateur
envious
he
could
sing
having
a
fine
tenor
voice
which
i
heard
the
very
day
i
learned
that
he
could
sing
it
so
happened
that
it
was
my
turn
to
buy
the
theater
tickets
and
i
invited
him
to
come
with
me
that
especial
evening
ca
do
it
he
replied
all
right
i
said
i
part
of
an
entertainment
tonight
or
i
would
he
added
apologetically
what
do
you
do
i
inquired
sing
get
out
i
said
so
be
it
he
answered
come
up
this
evening
to
this
i
finally
agreed
and
was
surprised
to
observe
the
ease
with
which
he
rendered
his
solo
he
had
an
exquisitely
clear
and
powerful
voice
and
received
a
long
round
of
applause
which
he
refused
to
acknowledge
by
singing
again
the
influence
of
success
is
easily
observable
in
a
man
of
so
volatile
a
nature
it
seems
to
me
that
i
could
have
told
by
his
manner
day
by
day
the
inwash
of
the
separate
ripples
of
the
inrolling
tide
of
success
he
was
all
alive
full
of
plans
and
the
tale
of
his
coming
conquests
was
told
in
his
eye
sometime
in
the
second
year
of
our
acquaintance
i
called
at
his
studio
in
response
to
a
card
which
he
had
stuck
under
my
office
door
it
was
his
habit
to
draw
an
outline
head
of
himself
something
almost
bordering
upon
a
caricature
writing
underneath
it
i
called
together
with
any
word
he
might
have
to
say
this
day
he
was
in
his
usual
good
spirits
and
rallied
me
upon
having
an
office
which
was
only
a
blind
he
had
a
roundabout
way
of
getting
me
to
talk
about
his
personal
affairs
with
him
and
i
soon
saw
that
he
had
something
very
interesting
to
himself
to
communicate
at
last
he
said
i
going
to
europe
next
summer
is
that
so
i
replied
for
pleasure
well
partly
what
up
outside
of
that
i
asked
i
going
to
represent
the
american
architectural
league
at
the
international
convention
i
did
know
you
were
an
architect
i
said
well
i
not
he
answered
professionally
i
studied
it
pretty
thoroughly
well
you
seem
to
be
coming
up
louis
i
remarked
i
doing
all
right
he
answered
he
went
on
working
at
his
easel
as
if
his
fate
depended
upon
what
he
was
doing
he
had
the
fortunate
quality
of
being
able
to
work
and
converse
most
entertainingly
at
the
same
time
he
seemed
to
enjoy
company
under
such
circumstances
you
did
know
i
was
a
baron
did
you
he
finally
observed
no
i
answered
thinking
he
was
exercising
his
fancy
for
the
moment
where
do
you
keep
your
baronial
lands
my
lord
in
germany
kind
sir
he
replied
banteringly
then
in
his
customary
excitable
mood
he
dropped
his
brushes
and
stood
up
you
do
believe
me
do
you
he
exclaimed
looking
over
his
drooping
glasses
why
certainly
i
believe
you
if
you
are
serious
are
you
truly
a
baron
it
was
this
way
he
said
my
grandfather
was
a
baron
my
father
was
the
younger
of
two
brothers
his
brother
got
the
title
and
what
was
left
of
the
estate
that
he
managed
to
go
through
with
and
then
he
died
now
no
one
has
bothered
about
the
title
and
you
going
back
to
claim
it
exactly
i
took
it
all
lightly
at
first
but
in
time
i
began
to
perceive
that
it
was
a
serious
ambition
he
truly
wanted
to
be
baron
s
and
add
to
himself
the
luster
of
his
ancestors
with
all
this
the
man
was
really
not
so
much
an
aristocrat
in
his
mood
as
a
seeker
after
life
and
new
experiences
being
a
baron
was
merely
a
new
experience
or
promised
to
be
he
had
the
liveliest
sympathies
for
republican
theories
and
institutions
only
he
considered
his
life
a
thing
apart
he
had
a
fine
mind
philosophically
and
logically
poised
he
could
reason
upon
all
things
from
the
latest
mathematical
theorem
to
christian
science
naturally
being
so
much
of
an
individualist
he
was
not
drifting
toward
any
belief
in
the
latter
but
was
never
weary
of
discussing
the
power
of
mind
a
universal
mind
even
its
wondrous
ramifications
and
influences
also
he
was
a
student
of
the
english
school
of
philosophy
and
loved
to
get
up
mathematical
and
mechanical
demonstrations
of
certain
philosophic
truths
thus
he
worked
out
by
means
of
a
polygon
whose
sides
were
of
unequal
lengths
a
theory
of
friendship
which
is
too
intricate
to
explain
here
from
now
on
i
watched
his
career
with
the
liveliest
interest
he
was
a
charming
and
a
warm
friend
and
never
neglected
for
a
moment
the
obligations
which
such
a
relationship
demands
i
heard
from
him
frequently
in
many
and
various
ways
dined
with
him
regularly
every
second
or
third
week
and
rejoiced
with
him
in
his
triumphs
now
more
and
more
frequent
one
spring
he
went
to
europe
and
spent
the
summer
in
tracing
down
his
baronial
claims
looking
up
various
artists
and
scientists
and
attending
several
scientific
meetings
here
and
there
at
the
same
time
he
did
the
illustrations
for
one
of
kipling
fast
express
stories
which
one
of
the
magazines
published
and
came
back
flushed
and
ready
to
try
hard
for
a
membership
in
the
american
society
i
shall
never
forget
his
anxiety
to
get
into
that
mildly
interesting
body
he
worked
hard
and
long
on
several
pictures
which
should
not
only
be
hung
on
the
line
but
enlist
sufficient
interest
among
the
artists
to
gain
him
a
vote
of
admission
he
mentioned
it
frequently
and
fixed
me
with
his
eyes
to
see
what
i
thought
of
him
go
ahead
i
said
you
have
more
right
to
membership
perhaps
than
many
another
i
know
try
hard
he
painted
not
one
but
four
pictures
and
sent
them
all
they
were
very
interesting
after
their
kind
two
were
scenes
from
the
great
railroad
terminal
yards
the
others
landscapes
in
mist
or
rain
three
of
these
pictures
were
passed
and
two
of
them
hung
on
the
line
the
third
was
but
he
was
admitted
to
membership
i
was
delighted
for
his
sake
for
i
could
see
when
he
gave
me
the
intelligence
that
it
was
a
matter
which
had
keyed
up
his
whole
nervous
system
not
long
after
this
we
were
walking
on
broadway
one
drizzly
autumn
evening
on
our
way
to
the
theater
life
ambition
and
our
future
were
the
subjects
under
discussion
the
street
as
usual
was
crowded
on
every
hand
blazed
the
fire
signs
the
yellow
lights
were
beautifully
reflected
in
the
wet
sidewalks
and
gray
wet
cobblestones
glistening
with
water
when
we
reached
greeley
square
at
that
time
a
brilliant
and
almost
sputtering
spectacle
of
light
and
merriment
s
took
me
by
the
arm
come
over
here
he
said
i
want
you
to
look
at
it
from
here
he
took
me
to
a
point
where
by
the
intersection
of
the
lines
of
the
converging
streets
one
could
not
only
see
greeley
square
but
a
large
part
of
herald
square
with
its
then
huge
theatrical
sign
of
fire
and
its
measure
of
store
lights
and
lamps
of
vehicles
it
was
a
kaleidoscopic
and
inspiring
scene
the
broad
converging
walks
were
alive
with
people
a
perfect
jam
of
vehicles
marked
the
spot
where
the
horse
and
cable
cars
intersected
overhead
was
the
elevated
station
its
lights
augmented
every
few
minutes
by
long
trains
of
brightly
lighted
cars
filled
with
changing
metropolitan
crowds
crowds
like
shadows
moving
in
a
dream
do
you
see
the
quality
of
that
look
at
the
blend
of
the
lights
and
shadows
in
there
under
the
i
looked
and
gazed
in
silent
admiration
see
right
here
before
us
that
pool
of
water
there
do
you
get
that
now
that
is
as
it
usually
represented
it
a
prism
do
you
see
the
hundred
points
of
light
i
acknowledged
the
variety
of
color
which
i
had
scarcely
observed
before
you
may
think
one
would
skip
that
in
viewing
a
great
scene
but
the
artist
must
he
must
get
all
whether
you
notice
it
or
not
it
gives
feeling
even
when
you
do
see
it
i
acknowledged
the
value
of
this
ideal
it
a
great
spectacle
he
said
it
got
more
flesh
and
blood
in
it
than
people
usually
think
it
easy
to
make
it
too
mechanical
and
commonplace
why
do
you
paint
it
i
asked
he
turned
on
me
as
if
he
had
been
waiting
for
the
suggestion
that
something
i
want
to
tell
you
he
said
i
am
i
sketched
it
a
times
already
i
have
got
it
yet
but
i
going
to
i
heard
more
of
these
dreams
intensifying
all
the
while
until
the
war
broke
out
then
he
was
off
in
a
great
rush
of
war
work
i
scarcely
saw
him
for
six
weeks
owing
to
some
travels
of
my
own
but
i
saw
his
name
one
day
in
broadway
i
stopped
to
see
why
a
large
crowd
was
gathered
about
a
window
in
the
hoffman
house
it
was
one
of
s
drawings
of
our
harbor
defenses
done
as
if
the
artist
had
been
sitting
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
the
fishes
the
green
water
the
hull
of
a
massive
all
were
there
and
about
the
grim
torpedoes
this
put
it
into
my
head
to
go
and
see
him
he
was
as
tense
and
strenuous
as
ever
the
glittering
treasure
at
the
end
of
the
rainbow
was
more
than
ever
in
his
eye
his
body
was
almost
sore
from
traveling
i
am
in
now
he
said
referring
to
the
war
movement
i
am
going
to
tampa
be
gone
long
i
asked
not
this
first
time
i
only
be
down
there
three
weeks
i
see
you
then
supposing
we
make
it
certain
he
said
what
do
you
say
to
dining
together
this
coming
sunday
three
weeks
i
went
away
wishing
him
a
fine
trip
and
feeling
that
his
dreams
must
now
soon
begin
to
come
true
he
was
growing
in
reputation
some
war
pictures
such
as
he
could
do
would
set
people
talking
then
he
would
paint
his
prize
pictures
finish
his
wreck
scheme
become
a
baron
and
be
a
great
man
three
weeks
later
i
knocked
at
his
studio
door
it
was
a
fine
springlike
day
though
it
was
in
february
i
expected
confidently
to
hear
his
quick
aggressive
step
inside
not
a
sound
in
reply
i
knocked
harder
but
still
received
no
answer
then
i
went
to
the
other
doors
about
he
might
be
with
his
friends
but
they
were
not
in
i
went
away
thinking
that
his
war
duties
had
interfered
that
he
had
not
returned
nevertheless
there
was
something
depressing
about
that
portion
of
the
building
in
which
his
studio
was
located
i
felt
as
if
it
should
not
be
and
decided
to
call
again
monday
it
was
the
same
and
tuesday
that
same
evening
i
was
sitting
in
the
library
of
the
salmagundi
club
when
a
artist
addressed
me
you
knew
s
did
you
he
said
yes
what
of
it
you
knew
he
was
dead
did
you
what
i
said
yes
he
died
of
fever
this
morning
i
looked
at
him
without
speaking
for
a
moment
too
bad
he
said
a
clever
boy
louis
awfully
clever
i
feel
sorry
for
his
father
it
did
not
take
long
to
verify
his
statement
his
name
was
in
the
perfunctory
death
lists
of
the
papers
the
next
morning
no
other
notice
of
any
sort
only
a
seemed
to
know
that
he
had
ever
lived
and
yet
it
seemed
that
a
great
tragedy
had
happened
he
was
so
ambitious
so
full
of
plans
his
dreams
were
so
near
fulfillment
i
saw
the
little
grave
afterward
and
the
empty
studio
his
desks
revealed
several
inventions
and
many
plans
of
useful
things
but
these
came
to
nothing
there
was
no
one
to
continue
the
work
my
feeling
at
the
time
was
as
if
i
had
been
looking
at
a
beautiful
lamp
lighted
warm
and
irradiating
a
charming
scene
and
then
suddenly
that
it
had
been
puffed
out
before
my
eyes
as
if
a
hundred
bubbles
of
iridescent
hues
had
been
shattered
by
a
breath
we
toil
so
much
we
dream
so
richly
we
hasten
so
fast
and
lo
the
green
door
is
opened
we
are
through
it
and
its
grassy
surface
has
sealed
us
forever
from
all
which
apparently
we
so
much
crave
even
as
breathlessly
we
are
still
running
