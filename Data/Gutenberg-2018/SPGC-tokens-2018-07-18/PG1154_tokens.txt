voyages
of

the
voyages
of
doctor
dolittle
prologue
all
that
i
have
written
so
far
about
doctor
dolittle
i
heard
long
after
it
happened
from
those
who
had
known
a
great
deal
of
it
took
place
before
i
was
born
but
i
now
come
to
set
down
that
part
of
the
great
man
s
life
which
i
myself
saw
and
took
part
in
many
years
ago
the
doctor
gave
me
permission
to
do
this
but
we
were
both
of
us
so
busy
then
voyaging
around
the
world
having
adventures
and
filling
full
of
natural
history
that
i
never
seemed
to
get
time
to
sit
down
and
write
of
our
doings
now
of
course
when
i
am
quite
an
old
man
my
memory
isn
t
so
good
any
more
but
whenever
i
am
in
doubt
and
have
to
hesitate
and
think
i
always
ask
polynesia
the
parrot
that
wonderful
bird
she
is
now
nearly
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
old
sits
on
the
top
of
my
desk
usually
humming
sailor
songs
to
herself
while
i
write
this
book
and
as
every
one
who
ever
met
her
knows
polynesia
s
memory
is
the
most
marvelous
memory
in
the
world
if
there
is
any
happening
i
am
not
quite
sure
of
she
is
always
able
to
put
me
right
to
tell
me
exactly
how
it
took
place
who
was
there
and
everything
about
it
in
fact
sometimes
i
almost
think
i
ought
to
say
that
this
book
was
written
by
polynesia
instead
of
me
very
well
then
i
will
begin
and
first
of
all
i
must
tell
you
something
about
myself
and
how
i
came
to
meet
the
doctor
part
i
first
the
cobbler
s
son
my
name
was
tommy
stubbins
son
of
jacob
stubbins
the
cobbler
of
and
i
was
nine
and
a
half
years
old
at
that
time
puddleby
was
only
quite
a
small
town
a
river
ran
through
the
middle
of
it
and
over
this
river
there
was
a
very
old
stone
bridge
called
kingsbridge
which
led
you
from
the
on
one
side
to
the
churchyard
on
the
other
came
up
this
river
from
the
sea
and
anchored
near
the
bridge
i
used
to
go
down
and
watch
the
sailors
unloading
the
ships
upon
the
the
sailors
sang
strange
songs
as
they
pulled
upon
the
ropes
and
i
learned
these
songs
by
heart
and
i
would
sit
on
the
with
my
feet
dangling
over
the
water
and
sing
with
the
men
pretending
to
myself
that
i
too
was
a
sailor
for
i
longed
always
to
sail
away
with
those
brave
ships
when
they
turned
their
backs
on
puddleby
church
and
went
creeping
down
the
river
again
across
the
wide
lonely
marshes
to
the
sea
i
longed
to
go
with
them
out
into
the
world
to
seek
my
fortune
in
foreign
india
china
and
peru
when
they
got
round
the
bend
in
the
river
and
the
water
was
hidden
from
view
you
could
still
see
their
huge
brown
sails
towering
over
the
roofs
of
the
town
moving
onward
some
gentle
giants
that
walked
among
the
houses
without
noise
what
strange
things
would
they
have
seen
i
wondered
when
next
they
came
back
to
anchor
at
kingsbridge
and
dreaming
of
the
lands
i
had
never
seen
i
d
sit
on
there
watching
till
they
were
out
of
sight
three
great
friends
i
had
in
puddleby
in
those
days
one
was
joe
the
who
lived
in
a
tiny
hut
by
the
edge
of
the
water
under
the
bridge
this
old
man
was
simply
marvelous
at
making
things
i
never
saw
a
man
so
clever
with
his
hands
he
used
to
mend
my
toy
ships
for
me
which
i
sailed
upon
the
river
he
built
windmills
out
of
and
and
he
could
make
the
most
wonderful
kites
from
old
umbrellas
joe
would
sometimes
take
me
in
his
and
when
the
tide
was
running
out
we
would
paddle
down
the
river
as
far
as
the
edge
of
the
sea
to
get
mussels
and
lobsters
to
sell
and
out
there
on
the
cold
lonely
marshes
we
would
see
wild
geese
flying
and
curlews
and
redshanks
and
many
other
kinds
of
seabirds
that
live
among
the
samfire
and
the
long
grass
of
the
great
salt
fen
and
as
we
crept
up
the
river
in
the
evening
when
the
tide
had
turned
we
would
see
the
lights
on
kingsbridge
twinkle
in
the
dusk
reminding
us
of
and
warm
fires
illustration
i
would
sit
on
the
with
my
feet
dangling
over
the
water
another
friend
i
had
was
matthew
mugg
the
cat
he
was
a
funny
old
person
with
a
bad
squint
he
looked
rather
awful
but
he
was
really
quite
nice
to
talk
to
he
knew
everybody
in
puddleby
and
he
knew
all
the
dogs
and
all
the
cats
in
those
times
being
a
cat
was
a
regular
business
and
you
could
see
one
nearly
any
day
going
through
the
streets
with
a
wooden
tray
full
of
pieces
of
meat
stuck
on
skewers
crying
meat
people
paid
him
to
give
this
meat
to
their
cats
and
dogs
instead
of
feeding
them
on
or
the
scraps
from
the
table
i
enjoyed
going
round
with
old
matthew
and
seeing
the
cats
and
dogs
come
running
to
the
whenever
they
heard
his
call
sometimes
he
let
me
give
the
meat
to
the
animals
myself
and
i
thought
this
was
great
fun
he
knew
a
lot
about
dogs
and
he
would
tell
me
the
names
of
the
different
kinds
as
we
went
through
the
town
he
had
several
dogs
of
his
own
one
a
whippet
was
a
very
fast
runner
and
matthew
used
to
win
prizes
with
her
at
the
saturday
coursing
races
another
a
terrier
was
a
fine
ratter
the
cat
used
to
make
a
business
of
for
the
millers
and
farmers
as
well
as
his
other
trade
of
selling
cat
my
third
great
friend
was
luke
the
hermit
but
of
him
i
will
tell
you
more
later
on
i
did
not
go
to
school
because
my
father
was
not
rich
enough
to
send
me
but
i
was
extremely
fond
of
animals
so
i
used
to
spend
my
time
collecting
birds
eggs
and
butterflies
fishing
in
the
river
rambling
through
the
countryside
after
blackberries
and
mushrooms
and
helping
the
mend
his
nets
yes
it
was
a
very
pleasant
life
i
lived
in
those
days
long
of
course
i
did
not
think
so
then
i
was
nine
and
a
half
years
old
and
like
all
boys
i
wanted
to
grow
knowing
how
well
off
i
was
with
no
cares
and
nothing
to
worry
me
always
i
longed
for
the
time
when
i
should
be
allowed
to
leave
my
father
s
house
to
take
passage
in
one
of
those
brave
ships
to
sail
down
the
river
through
the
misty
marshes
to
the
into
the
world
to
seek
my
fortune
second
i
hear
of
the
great
naturalist
one
early
morning
in
the
springtime
when
i
was
wandering
among
the
hills
at
the
back
of
the
town
i
happened
to
come
upon
a
hawk
with
a
squirrel
in
its
claws
it
was
standing
on
a
rock
and
the
squirrel
was
fighting
very
hard
for
its
life
the
hawk
was
so
frightened
when
i
came
upon
it
suddenly
like
this
that
it
dropped
the
poor
creature
and
flew
away
i
picked
the
squirrel
up
and
found
that
two
of
its
legs
were
badly
hurt
so
i
carried
it
in
my
arms
back
to
the
town
when
i
came
to
the
bridge
i
went
into
the
s
hut
and
asked
him
if
he
could
do
anything
for
it
joe
put
on
his
spectacles
and
examined
it
carefully
then
he
shook
his
head
yon
crittur
s
got
a
broken
leg
he
and
another
badly
cut
an
all
i
can
mend
you
your
boats
tom
but
i
haven
t
the
tools
nor
the
learning
to
make
a
broken
squirrel
seaworthy
this
is
a
job
for
a
for
a
right
smart
one
an
all
there
be
only
one
man
i
know
who
could
save
yon
crittur
s
life
and
that
s
john
who
is
john
dolittle
i
asked
is
he
a
vet
no
said
the
he
s
no
vet
doctor
dolittle
is
a
what
s
a
nacheralist
a
nacheralist
said
joe
putting
away
his
glasses
and
starting
to
fill
his
pipe
is
a
man
who
knows
all
about
animals
and
butterflies
and
plants
and
rocks
an
all
john
dolittle
is
a
very
great
nacheralist
i
m
surprised
you
never
heard
of
you
daft
over
animals
he
knows
a
whole
lot
about
i
know
from
my
own
knowledge
he
s
a
quiet
man
and
don
t
talk
much
but
there
s
folks
who
do
say
he
s
the
greatest
nacheralist
in
the
where
does
he
live
i
asked
over
on
the
oxenthorpe
road
t
other
side
the
town
don
t
know
just
which
house
it
is
but
most
anyone
cross
there
could
tell
you
i
reckon
go
and
see
him
he
s
a
great
so
i
thanked
the
took
up
my
squirrel
again
and
started
off
towards
the
oxenthorpe
road
the
first
thing
i
heard
as
i
came
into
the
was
some
one
calling
meat
there
s
matthew
mugg
i
said
to
myself
he
ll
know
where
this
doctor
lives
matthew
knows
so
i
hurried
across
the
and
caught
him
up
matthew
i
said
do
you
know
doctor
dolittle
do
i
know
john
dolittle
said
he
well
i
should
think
i
do
i
know
him
as
well
as
i
know
my
own
i
sometimes
think
he
s
a
great
very
great
can
you
show
me
where
he
lives
i
asked
i
want
to
take
this
squirrel
to
him
it
has
a
broken
certainly
said
the
cat
i
ll
be
going
right
by
his
house
directly
come
along
and
i
ll
show
so
off
we
went
together
oh
i
ve
known
john
dolittle
for
years
and
years
said
matthew
as
we
made
our
way
out
of
the
but
i
m
pretty
sure
he
ain
t
home
just
now
he
s
away
on
a
voyage
but
he
s
liable
to
be
back
any
day
i
ll
show
you
his
house
and
then
you
ll
know
where
to
find
all
the
way
down
the
oxenthorpe
road
matthew
hardly
stopped
talking
about
his
great
friend
doctor
john
m
he
talked
so
much
that
he
forgot
all
about
calling
out
meat
until
we
both
suddenly
noticed
that
we
had
a
whole
procession
of
dogs
following
us
patiently
where
did
the
doctor
go
to
on
this
voyage
i
asked
as
matthew
handed
round
the
meat
to
them
i
couldn
t
tell
you
he
answered
nobody
never
knows
where
he
goes
nor
when
he
s
going
nor
when
he
s
coming
back
he
lives
all
alone
except
for
his
pets
he
s
made
some
great
voyages
and
some
wonderful
discoveries
last
time
he
came
back
he
told
me
he
d
found
a
tribe
of
red
indians
in
the
pacific
on
two
islands
they
did
the
husbands
lived
on
one
island
and
the
wives
lived
on
the
other
sensible
people
some
of
them
savages
they
only
met
once
a
year
when
the
husbands
came
over
to
visit
the
wives
for
a
great
most
likely
yes
he
s
a
wonderful
man
is
the
doctor
and
as
for
animals
well
there
ain
t
no
one
knows
as
much
about
em
as
what
he
how
did
he
get
to
know
so
much
about
animals
i
asked
the
cat
stopped
and
leant
down
to
whisper
in
my
ear
talks
their
he
said
in
a
hoarse
mysterious
voice
the
animals
language
i
cried
why
certainly
said
matthew
all
animals
have
some
kind
of
a
language
some
sorts
talk
more
than
others
some
only
speak
in
like
but
the
doctor
he
understands
them
as
well
as
animals
we
keep
it
a
secret
though
him
and
me
because
folks
only
laugh
at
you
when
you
speak
of
it
why
he
can
even
write
he
reads
aloud
to
his
pets
he
s
wrote
in
poetry
in
canary
language
and
comic
songs
for
magpies
to
sing
it
s
a
fact
he
s
now
busy
learning
the
language
of
the
shellfish
but
he
says
it
s
hard
he
has
caught
some
terrible
colds
holding
his
head
under
water
so
much
he
s
a
great
he
certainly
must
be
i
said
i
do
wish
he
were
home
so
i
could
meet
well
there
s
his
house
look
said
the
cat
that
little
one
at
the
bend
in
the
road
one
high
it
was
sitting
on
the
wall
above
the
we
were
now
come
beyond
the
edge
of
the
town
and
the
house
that
matthew
pointed
out
was
quite
a
small
one
standing
by
itself
there
seemed
to
be
a
big
garden
around
it
and
this
garden
was
much
higher
than
the
road
so
you
had
to
go
up
a
flight
of
steps
in
the
wall
before
you
reached
the
front
gate
at
the
top
i
could
see
that
there
were
many
fine
fruit
trees
in
the
garden
for
their
branches
hung
down
over
the
wall
in
places
but
the
wall
was
so
high
i
could
not
see
anything
else
when
we
reached
the
house
matthew
went
up
the
steps
to
the
front
gate
and
i
followed
him
i
thought
he
was
going
to
go
into
the
garden
but
the
gate
was
locked
a
dog
came
running
down
from
the
house
and
he
took
several
pieces
of
meat
which
the
cat
pushed
through
the
bars
of
the
gate
and
some
paper
bags
full
of
corn
and
bran
i
noticed
that
this
dog
did
not
stop
to
eat
the
meat
as
any
ordinary
dog
would
have
done
but
he
took
all
the
things
back
to
the
house
and
disappeared
he
had
a
curious
wide
collar
round
his
neck
which
looked
as
though
it
were
made
of
brass
or
something
then
we
came
away
the
doctor
isn
t
back
yet
said
matthew
or
the
gate
wouldn
t
be
what
were
all
those
things
in
you
gave
the
dog
i
asked
oh
those
were
provisions
said
things
for
the
animals
to
eat
the
doctor
s
house
is
simply
full
of
pets
i
give
the
things
to
the
dog
while
the
doctor
s
away
and
the
dog
gives
them
to
the
other
and
what
was
that
curious
collar
he
was
wearing
round
his
neck
that
s
a
solid
gold
said
matthew
it
was
given
to
him
when
he
was
with
the
doctor
on
one
of
his
voyages
long
ago
he
saved
a
man
s
how
long
has
the
doctor
had
him
i
asked
oh
a
long
time
jip
s
getting
pretty
old
now
that
s
why
the
doctor
doesn
t
take
him
on
his
voyages
any
more
he
leaves
him
behind
to
take
care
of
the
house
every
monday
and
thursday
i
bring
the
food
to
the
gate
here
and
give
it
him
through
the
bars
he
never
lets
any
one
come
inside
the
garden
while
the
doctor
s
even
me
though
he
knows
me
well
but
you
ll
always
be
able
to
tell
if
the
doctor
s
back
or
if
he
is
the
gate
will
surely
be
so
i
went
off
home
to
my
father
s
house
and
put
my
squirrel
to
bed
in
an
old
wooden
box
full
of
straw
and
there
i
nursed
him
myself
and
took
care
of
him
as
best
i
could
till
the
time
should
come
when
the
doctor
would
return
and
every
day
i
went
to
the
little
house
with
the
big
garden
on
the
edge
of
the
town
and
tried
the
gate
to
see
if
it
were
locked
sometimes
the
dog
jip
would
come
down
to
the
gate
to
meet
me
but
though
he
always
wagged
his
tail
and
seemed
glad
to
see
me
he
never
let
me
come
inside
the
garden
third
the
doctor
s
home
one
monday
afternoon
towards
the
end
of
april
my
father
asked
me
to
take
some
shoes
which
he
had
mended
to
a
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
they
were
for
a
colonel
bellowes
who
was
very
particular
i
found
the
house
and
rang
the
bell
at
the
front
door
the
colonel
opened
it
stuck
out
a
very
red
face
and
said
go
round
to
the
tradesmen
s
to
the
back
then
he
slammed
the
door
shut
i
felt
inclined
to
throw
the
shoes
into
the
middle
of
his
but
i
thought
my
father
might
be
angry
so
i
didn
t
i
went
round
to
the
back
door
and
there
the
colonel
s
wife
met
me
and
took
the
shoes
from
me
she
looked
a
timid
little
woman
and
had
her
hands
all
over
flour
as
though
she
were
making
bread
she
seemed
to
be
terribly
afraid
of
her
husband
whom
i
could
still
hear
stumping
round
the
house
somewhere
grunting
indignantly
because
i
had
come
to
the
front
door
then
she
asked
me
in
a
whisper
if
i
would
have
a
bun
and
a
glass
of
milk
and
i
said
yes
after
i
had
eaten
the
bun
and
milk
i
thanked
the
colonel
s
wife
and
came
away
then
i
thought
that
before
i
went
home
i
would
go
and
see
if
the
doctor
had
come
back
yet
i
had
been
to
his
house
once
already
that
morning
but
i
thought
i
d
just
like
to
go
and
take
another
look
my
squirrel
wasn
t
getting
any
better
and
i
was
beginning
to
be
worried
about
him
so
i
turned
into
the
oxenthorpe
road
and
started
off
towards
the
doctor
s
house
on
the
way
i
noticed
that
the
sky
was
clouding
over
and
that
it
looked
as
though
it
might
rain
i
reached
the
gate
and
found
it
still
locked
i
felt
very
discouraged
i
had
been
coming
here
every
day
for
a
week
now
the
dog
jip
came
to
the
gate
and
wagged
his
tail
as
usual
and
then
sat
down
and
watched
me
closely
to
see
that
i
didn
t
get
in
i
began
to
fear
that
my
squirrel
would
die
before
the
doctor
came
back
i
turned
away
sadly
went
down
the
steps
on
to
the
road
and
turned
towards
home
again
i
wondered
if
it
were
yet
of
course
i
had
no
watch
of
my
own
but
i
noticed
a
gentleman
coming
towards
me
down
the
road
and
when
he
got
nearer
i
saw
it
was
the
colonel
out
for
a
walk
he
was
all
wrapped
up
in
smart
overcoats
and
mufflers
and
gloves
it
was
not
a
very
cold
day
but
he
had
so
many
clothes
on
he
looked
like
a
pillow
inside
a
roll
of
blankets
i
asked
him
if
he
would
please
tell
me
the
time
he
stopped
grunted
and
glared
down
at
red
face
growing
redder
still
and
when
he
spoke
it
sounded
like
the
cork
coming
out
of
a
do
you
imagine
for
one
moment
he
spluttered
that
i
am
going
to
get
myself
all
unbuttoned
just
to
tell
a
little
boy
like
you
and
he
went
stumping
down
the
street
grunting
harder
than
ever
i
stood
still
a
moment
looking
after
him
and
wondering
how
old
i
would
have
to
be
to
have
him
go
to
the
trouble
of
getting
his
watch
out
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
the
rain
came
down
in
torrents
i
have
never
seen
it
rain
so
hard
it
got
dark
almost
like
night
the
wind
began
to
blow
the
thunder
rolled
the
lightning
flashed
and
in
a
moment
the
gutters
of
the
road
were
flowing
like
a
river
there
was
no
place
handy
to
take
shelter
so
i
put
my
head
down
against
the
driving
wind
and
started
to
run
towards
home
i
hadn
t
gone
very
far
when
my
head
bumped
into
something
soft
and
i
sat
down
suddenly
on
the
pavement
i
looked
up
to
see
whom
i
had
run
into
and
there
in
front
of
me
sitting
on
the
wet
pavement
like
myself
was
a
little
round
man
with
a
very
kind
face
he
wore
a
shabby
high
hat
and
in
his
hand
he
had
a
small
black
bag
i
m
very
sorry
i
said
i
had
my
head
down
and
i
didn
t
see
you
to
my
great
surprise
instead
of
getting
angry
at
being
knocked
down
the
little
man
began
to
laugh
you
know
this
reminds
me
he
said
of
a
time
once
when
i
was
in
india
i
ran
full
tilt
into
a
woman
in
a
thunderstorm
but
she
was
carrying
a
pitcher
of
molasses
on
her
head
and
i
had
treacle
in
my
hair
for
weeks
flies
followed
me
everywhere
i
didn
t
hurt
you
did
i
no
i
said
i
m
all
it
was
just
as
much
my
fault
as
it
was
yours
you
know
said
the
little
man
i
had
my
head
down
look
here
we
mustn
t
sit
talking
like
this
you
must
be
soaked
i
know
i
am
how
far
have
you
got
to
go
my
home
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
i
said
as
we
picked
ourselves
up
my
goodness
but
that
a
wet
pavement
said
he
and
i
declare
it
s
coming
down
worse
than
ever
come
along
to
my
house
and
get
dried
a
storm
like
this
can
t
he
took
hold
of
my
hand
and
we
started
running
back
down
the
road
together
as
we
ran
i
began
to
wonder
who
this
funny
little
man
could
be
and
where
he
lived
i
was
a
perfect
stranger
to
him
and
yet
he
was
taking
me
to
his
own
home
to
get
dried
such
a
change
after
the
old
colonel
who
had
refused
even
to
tell
me
the
time
presently
we
stopped
here
we
are
he
said
i
looked
up
to
see
where
we
were
and
found
myself
back
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
leading
to
the
little
house
with
the
big
garden
my
new
friend
was
already
running
up
the
steps
and
opening
the
gate
with
some
keys
he
took
from
his
pocket
surely
i
thought
this
can
not
be
the
great
doctor
dolittle
himself
i
suppose
after
hearing
so
much
about
him
i
had
expected
some
one
very
tall
and
strong
and
marvelous
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
this
funny
little
man
with
the
kind
smiling
face
could
be
really
he
yet
here
he
was
sure
enough
running
up
the
steps
and
opening
the
very
gate
which
i
had
been
watching
for
so
many
days
the
dog
jip
came
rushing
out
and
started
jumping
up
on
him
and
barking
with
happiness
the
rain
was
splashing
down
heavier
than
ever
are
you
doctor
dolittle
i
shouted
as
we
sped
up
the
short
to
the
house
yes
i
m
doctor
dolittle
said
he
opening
the
front
door
with
the
same
bunch
of
keys
get
in
don
t
bother
about
wiping
your
feet
never
mind
the
mud
take
it
in
with
you
get
in
out
of
the
rain
i
popped
in
he
and
jip
following
then
he
slammed
the
door
to
behind
us
the
storm
had
made
it
dark
enough
outside
but
inside
the
house
with
the
door
closed
it
was
as
black
as
night
then
began
the
most
extraordinary
noise
that
i
have
ever
heard
it
sounded
like
all
sorts
and
kinds
of
animals
and
birds
calling
and
squeaking
and
screeching
at
the
same
time
i
could
hear
things
trundling
down
the
stairs
and
hurrying
along
passages
somewhere
in
the
dark
a
duck
was
quacking
a
cock
was
crowing
a
dove
was
cooing
an
owl
was
hooting
a
lamb
was
bleating
and
jip
was
barking
i
felt
birds
wings
fluttering
and
fanning
near
my
face
things
kept
bumping
into
my
legs
and
nearly
upsetting
me
the
whole
front
hall
seemed
to
be
filling
up
with
animals
the
noise
together
with
the
roaring
of
the
rain
was
tremendous
and
i
was
beginning
to
grow
a
little
bit
scared
when
i
felt
the
doctor
take
hold
of
my
arm
and
shout
into
my
ear
don
t
be
alarmed
don
t
be
frightened
these
are
just
some
of
my
pets
i
ve
been
away
three
months
and
they
are
glad
to
see
me
home
again
stand
still
where
you
are
till
i
strike
a
light
my
gracious
what
a
storm
listen
to
that
thunder
so
there
i
stood
in
the
dark
while
all
kinds
of
animals
which
i
couldn
t
see
chattered
and
jostled
around
me
it
was
a
curious
and
a
funny
feeling
i
had
often
wondered
when
i
had
looked
in
from
the
front
gate
what
doctor
dolittle
would
be
like
and
what
the
funny
little
house
would
have
inside
it
but
i
never
imagined
it
would
be
anything
like
this
yet
somehow
after
i
had
felt
the
doctor
s
hand
upon
my
arm
i
was
not
frightened
only
confused
it
all
seemed
like
some
queer
dream
and
i
was
beginning
to
wonder
if
i
was
really
awake
when
i
heard
the
doctor
speaking
again
my
blessed
matches
are
all
wet
they
won
t
strike
have
you
got
any
no
i
m
afraid
i
haven
t
i
called
back
never
mind
said
he
perhaps
can
raise
us
a
light
then
the
doctor
made
some
funny
clicking
noises
with
his
tongue
and
i
heard
some
one
trundle
up
the
stairs
again
and
start
moving
about
in
the
rooms
above
then
we
waited
quite
a
while
without
anything
happening
will
the
light
be
long
in
coming
i
asked
some
animal
is
sitting
on
my
foot
and
my
toes
are
going
to
no
only
a
minute
said
the
doctor
she
ll
be
back
in
a
and
just
then
i
saw
the
first
glimmerings
of
a
light
around
the
landing
above
at
once
all
the
animals
kept
quiet
illustration
and
in
her
right
foot
she
carried
a
lighted
candle
i
thought
you
lived
alone
i
said
to
the
doctor
so
i
do
said
he
it
is
who
is
bringing
the
i
looked
up
the
stairs
trying
to
make
out
who
was
coming
i
could
not
see
around
the
landing
but
i
heard
the
most
curious
footstep
on
the
upper
flight
it
sounded
like
some
one
hopping
down
from
one
step
to
the
other
as
though
he
were
using
only
one
leg
as
the
light
came
lower
it
grew
brighter
and
began
to
throw
strange
jumping
shadows
on
the
walls
last
said
the
doctor
good
old
and
then
i
thought
i
must
be
dreaming
for
there
craning
her
neck
round
the
bend
of
the
landing
hopping
down
the
stairs
on
one
leg
came
a
spotless
white
duck
and
in
her
right
foot
she
carried
a
lighted
candle
fourth
the
when
at
last
i
could
look
around
me
i
found
that
the
hall
was
indeed
simply
full
of
animals
it
seemed
to
me
that
almost
every
kind
of
creature
from
the
countryside
must
be
there
a
pigeon
a
white
rat
an
owl
a
badger
a
was
even
a
small
pig
just
in
from
the
rainy
garden
carefully
wiping
his
feet
on
the
mat
while
the
light
from
the
candle
glistened
on
his
wet
pink
back
the
doctor
took
the
candlestick
from
the
duck
and
turned
to
me
look
here
he
said
you
must
get
those
wet
clothes
the
way
what
is
your
name
tommy
stubbins
i
said
oh
are
you
the
son
of
jacob
stubbins
the
shoemaker
yes
i
said
excellent
bootmaker
your
father
said
the
doctor
you
see
these
and
he
held
up
his
right
foot
to
show
me
the
enormous
boots
he
was
wearing
your
father
made
me
those
boots
four
years
ago
and
i
ve
been
wearing
them
ever
wonderful
now
look
here
stubbins
you
ve
got
to
change
those
wet
quick
wait
a
moment
till
i
get
some
more
candles
lit
and
then
we
ll
go
upstairs
and
find
some
dry
clothes
you
ll
have
to
wear
an
old
suit
of
mine
till
we
can
get
yours
dry
again
by
the
so
presently
when
more
candles
had
been
lighted
round
different
parts
of
the
house
we
went
upstairs
and
when
we
had
come
into
a
bedroom
the
doctor
opened
a
big
wardrobe
and
took
out
two
suits
of
old
clothes
these
we
put
on
then
we
carried
our
wet
ones
down
to
the
kitchen
and
started
a
fire
in
the
big
chimney
the
coat
of
the
doctor
s
which
i
was
wearing
was
so
large
for
me
that
i
kept
treading
on
my
own
while
i
was
helping
to
fetch
the
wood
up
from
the
cellar
but
very
soon
we
had
a
huge
big
fire
blazing
up
the
chimney
and
we
hung
our
wet
clothes
around
on
chairs
now
let
s
cook
some
supper
said
the
you
ll
stay
and
have
supper
with
me
stubbins
of
course
already
i
was
beginning
to
be
very
fond
of
this
funny
little
man
who
called
me
stubbins
instead
of
tommy
or
little
lad
i
did
so
hate
to
be
called
little
lad
this
man
seemed
to
begin
right
away
treating
me
as
though
i
were
a
friend
of
his
and
when
he
asked
me
to
stop
and
have
supper
with
him
i
felt
terribly
proud
and
happy
but
i
suddenly
remembered
that
i
had
not
told
my
mother
that
i
would
be
out
late
so
very
sadly
i
answered
thank
you
very
much
i
would
like
to
stay
but
i
am
afraid
that
my
mother
will
begin
to
worry
and
wonder
where
i
am
if
i
don
t
get
oh
but
my
dear
stubbins
said
the
doctor
throwing
another
log
of
wood
on
the
fire
your
clothes
aren
t
dry
yet
you
ll
have
to
wait
for
them
won
t
you
by
the
time
they
are
ready
to
put
on
we
will
have
supper
cooked
and
you
see
where
i
put
my
bag
i
think
it
is
still
in
the
hall
i
said
i
ll
go
and
i
found
the
bag
near
the
front
door
it
was
made
of
black
leather
and
looked
very
very
old
one
of
its
latches
was
broken
and
it
was
tied
up
round
the
middle
with
a
piece
of
string
thank
you
said
the
doctor
when
i
brought
it
to
him
was
that
bag
all
the
luggage
you
had
for
your
voyage
i
asked
yes
said
the
doctor
as
he
undid
the
piece
of
string
i
don
t
believe
in
a
lot
of
baggage
it
s
such
a
nuisance
life
s
too
short
to
fuss
with
it
and
it
isn
t
really
necessary
you
i
put
those
sausages
the
doctor
was
feeling
about
inside
the
bag
first
he
brought
out
a
loaf
of
new
bread
next
came
a
glass
jar
with
a
curious
metal
top
to
it
he
held
this
up
to
the
light
very
carefully
before
he
set
it
down
upon
the
table
and
i
could
see
that
there
was
some
strange
little
swimming
about
inside
at
last
the
doctor
brought
out
a
pound
of
sausages
now
he
said
all
we
want
is
a
we
went
into
the
scullery
and
there
we
found
some
pots
and
pans
hanging
against
the
wall
the
doctor
took
down
the
it
was
quite
rusty
on
the
inside
dear
me
just
look
at
that
said
he
that
s
the
worst
of
being
away
so
long
the
animals
are
very
good
and
keep
the
house
wonderfully
clean
as
far
as
they
can
is
a
perfect
marvel
as
a
housekeeper
but
some
things
of
course
they
can
t
manage
never
mind
we
ll
soon
clean
it
up
you
ll
find
some
down
there
under
the
sink
stubbins
just
hand
it
up
to
me
will
you
in
a
few
moments
we
had
the
pan
all
shiny
and
bright
and
the
sausages
were
put
over
the
and
a
beautiful
frying
smell
went
all
through
the
house
while
the
doctor
was
busy
at
the
cooking
i
went
and
took
another
look
at
the
funny
little
creature
swimming
about
in
the
glass
jar
what
is
this
animal
i
asked
oh
that
said
the
doctor
turning
that
s
a
its
full
name
is
but
the
natives
just
call
it
a
account
of
the
way
it
waves
its
tail
swimming
i
imagine
that
s
what
i
went
on
this
last
voyage
for
to
get
that
you
see
i
m
very
busy
just
now
trying
to
learn
the
language
of
the
shellfish
they
languages
of
that
i
feel
sure
i
can
talk
a
little
shark
language
and
porpoise
dialect
myself
but
what
i
particularly
want
to
learn
now
is
why
i
asked
well
you
see
some
of
the
shellfish
are
the
oldest
kind
of
animals
in
the
world
that
we
know
of
we
find
their
shells
in
the
to
of
years
old
so
i
feel
quite
sure
that
if
i
could
only
get
to
talk
their
language
i
should
be
able
to
learn
a
whole
lot
about
what
the
world
was
like
ages
and
ages
and
ages
ago
you
see
but
couldn
t
some
of
the
other
animals
tell
you
as
well
i
don
t
think
so
said
the
doctor
prodding
the
sausages
with
a
fork
to
be
sure
the
monkeys
i
knew
in
africa
some
time
ago
were
very
helpful
in
telling
me
about
bygone
days
but
they
only
went
back
a
thousand
years
or
so
no
i
am
certain
that
the
oldest
history
in
the
world
is
to
be
had
from
the
from
them
only
you
see
most
of
the
other
animals
that
were
alive
in
those
very
ancient
times
have
now
become
have
you
learned
any
shellfish
language
yet
i
asked
no
i
ve
only
just
begun
i
wanted
this
particular
kind
of
a
because
he
is
half
a
shellfish
and
half
an
ordinary
fish
i
went
all
the
way
to
the
eastern
mediterranean
after
him
but
i
m
very
much
afraid
he
isn
t
going
to
be
a
great
deal
of
help
to
me
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
m
rather
disappointed
in
his
appearance
he
doesn
t
very
intelligent
does
he
no
he
doesn
t
i
agreed
ah
said
the
doctor
the
sausages
are
done
to
a
turn
come
your
plate
near
and
let
me
give
you
then
we
sat
down
at
the
and
started
a
hearty
meal
it
was
a
wonderful
kitchen
that
i
had
many
meals
there
afterwards
and
i
found
it
a
better
place
to
eat
in
than
the
grandest
in
the
world
it
was
so
cozy
and
and
warm
it
was
so
handy
for
the
food
too
you
took
it
right
off
the
fire
hot
and
put
it
on
the
table
and
ate
it
and
you
could
watch
your
toast
toasting
at
the
fender
and
see
it
didn
t
burn
while
you
drank
your
soup
and
if
you
had
forgotten
to
put
the
salt
on
the
table
you
didn
t
have
to
get
up
and
go
into
another
room
to
fetch
it
you
just
reached
round
and
took
the
big
wooden
box
off
the
dresser
behind
you
then
the
biggest
fireplace
you
ever
like
a
room
in
itself
you
could
get
right
inside
it
even
when
the
logs
were
burning
and
sit
on
the
wide
seats
either
side
and
roast
chestnuts
after
the
meal
was
listen
to
the
kettle
singing
or
tell
stories
or
look
at
by
the
light
of
the
fire
it
was
a
marvelous
kitchen
it
was
like
the
doctor
comfortable
sensible
friendly
and
solid
while
we
were
gobbling
away
the
door
suddenly
opened
and
in
marched
the
duck
and
the
dog
jip
dragging
sheets
and
behind
them
over
the
clean
tiled
floor
the
doctor
seeing
how
surprised
i
was
explained
they
re
just
going
to
air
the
bedding
for
me
in
front
of
the
fire
is
a
perfect
treasure
of
a
housekeeper
she
never
forgets
anything
i
had
a
sister
once
who
used
to
keep
house
for
me
poor
dear
sarah
i
wonder
how
she
s
getting
haven
t
seen
her
in
many
years
but
she
wasn
t
nearly
as
good
as
have
another
sausage
the
doctor
turned
and
said
a
few
words
to
the
dog
and
duck
in
some
strange
talk
and
signs
they
seemed
to
understand
him
perfectly
can
you
talk
in
squirrel
language
i
asked
oh
yes
that
s
quite
an
easy
language
said
the
doctor
you
could
learn
that
yourself
without
a
great
deal
of
trouble
but
why
do
you
ask
because
i
have
a
sick
squirrel
at
home
i
said
i
took
it
away
from
a
hawk
but
two
of
its
legs
are
badly
hurt
and
i
wanted
very
much
to
have
you
see
it
if
you
would
shall
i
bring
it
well
if
its
leg
is
badly
broken
i
think
i
had
better
see
it
it
may
be
too
late
to
do
much
but
i
ll
come
home
with
you
and
take
a
look
at
so
presently
we
felt
the
clothes
by
the
fire
and
mine
were
found
to
be
quite
dry
i
took
them
upstairs
to
the
bedroom
and
changed
and
when
i
came
down
the
doctor
was
all
ready
waiting
for
me
with
his
little
black
bag
full
of
medicines
and
bandages
come
along
he
said
the
rain
has
stopped
outside
it
had
grown
bright
again
and
the
evening
sky
was
all
red
with
the
setting
sun
and
thrushes
were
singing
in
the
garden
as
we
opened
the
gate
to
go
down
on
to
the
road
fifth
polynesia
i
think
your
house
is
the
most
interesting
house
i
was
ever
in
i
said
as
we
set
off
in
the
direction
of
the
town
may
i
come
and
see
you
again
certainly
said
the
doctor
come
any
day
you
like
i
ll
show
you
the
garden
and
my
private
oh
have
you
a
zoo
i
asked
yes
said
he
the
larger
animals
are
too
big
for
the
house
so
i
keep
them
in
a
zoo
in
the
garden
it
is
not
a
very
big
collection
but
it
is
interesting
in
its
it
must
be
splendid
i
said
to
be
able
to
talk
all
the
languages
of
the
different
animals
do
you
think
i
could
ever
learn
to
do
it
oh
surely
said
the
with
practise
you
have
to
be
very
patient
you
know
you
really
ought
to
have
polynesia
to
start
you
it
was
she
who
gave
me
my
first
who
is
polynesia
i
asked
polynesia
was
a
west
african
parrot
i
had
she
isn
t
with
me
any
more
now
said
the
doctor
sadly
she
dead
oh
no
said
the
doctor
she
is
still
living
i
hope
but
when
we
reached
africa
she
seemed
so
glad
to
get
back
to
her
own
country
she
wept
for
joy
and
when
the
time
came
for
me
to
come
back
here
i
had
not
the
heart
to
take
her
away
from
that
sunny
it
is
true
she
did
offer
to
come
i
left
her
in
well
i
have
missed
her
terribly
she
wept
again
when
we
left
but
i
think
i
did
the
right
thing
she
was
one
of
the
best
friends
i
ever
had
it
was
she
who
first
gave
me
the
idea
of
learning
the
animal
languages
and
becoming
an
animal
doctor
i
often
wonder
if
she
remained
happy
in
africa
and
whether
i
shall
ever
see
her
funny
old
solemn
face
old
polynesia
most
extraordinary
well
just
at
that
moment
we
heard
the
noise
of
some
one
running
behind
us
and
turning
round
we
saw
jip
the
dog
rushing
down
the
road
after
us
as
fast
as
his
legs
could
bring
him
he
seemed
very
excited
about
something
and
as
soon
as
he
came
up
to
us
he
started
barking
and
whining
to
the
doctor
in
a
peculiar
way
then
the
doctor
too
seemed
to
get
all
worked
up
and
began
talking
and
making
queer
signs
to
the
dog
at
length
he
turned
to
me
his
face
shining
with
happiness
polynesia
has
come
back
he
cried
imagine
it
jip
says
she
has
just
arrived
at
the
house
my
and
it
s
five
years
since
i
saw
me
a
he
turned
as
if
to
go
back
home
but
the
parrot
polynesia
was
already
flying
towards
us
the
doctor
clapped
his
hands
like
a
child
getting
a
new
toy
while
the
swarm
of
sparrows
in
the
roadway
fluttered
gossiping
up
on
to
the
fences
highly
scandalized
to
see
a
gray
and
scarlet
parrot
skimming
down
an
english
lane
on
she
came
straight
on
to
the
doctor
s
shoulder
where
she
immediately
began
talking
a
steady
stream
in
a
language
i
could
not
understand
she
seemed
to
have
a
terrible
lot
to
say
and
very
soon
the
doctor
had
forgotten
all
about
me
and
my
squirrel
and
jip
and
everything
else
till
at
length
the
bird
clearly
asked
him
something
about
me
oh
excuse
me
stubbins
said
the
doctor
i
was
so
interested
listening
to
my
old
friend
here
we
must
get
on
and
see
this
squirrel
of
this
is
thomas
the
parrot
on
the
doctor
s
shoulder
nodded
gravely
towards
me
and
then
to
my
great
surprise
said
quite
plainly
in
english
how
do
you
do
i
remember
the
night
you
were
born
it
was
a
terribly
cold
winter
you
were
a
very
ugly
stubbins
is
anxious
to
learn
animal
language
said
the
doctor
i
was
just
telling
him
about
you
and
the
lessons
you
gave
me
when
jip
ran
up
and
told
us
you
had
well
said
the
parrot
turning
to
me
i
may
have
started
the
doctor
learning
but
i
never
could
have
done
even
that
if
he
hadn
t
first
taught
me
to
understand
what
was
saying
when
i
spoke
english
you
see
many
parrots
can
talk
like
a
person
but
very
few
of
them
understand
what
they
are
saying
they
just
say
it
because
they
fancy
it
is
smart
or
because
they
know
they
will
get
crackers
given
by
this
time
we
had
turned
and
were
going
towards
my
home
with
jip
running
in
front
and
polynesia
still
perched
on
the
doctor
s
shoulder
the
bird
chattered
incessantly
mostly
about
africa
but
now
she
spoke
in
english
out
of
politeness
to
me
how
is
prince
bumpo
getting
on
asked
the
doctor
oh
i
m
glad
you
asked
me
said
polynesia
i
almost
forgot
to
tell
you
what
do
you
think
is
in
england
in
england
don
t
say
cried
the
doctor
what
on
earth
is
he
doing
here
his
father
the
king
sent
him
here
to
a
place
i
think
it
study
bullford
muttered
the
doctor
i
never
heard
of
the
you
mean
yes
that
s
the
said
polynesia
i
knew
it
had
cattle
in
it
somewhere
s
the
place
he
s
gone
well
well
murmured
the
doctor
fancy
bumpo
studying
at
well
there
were
great
doings
in
jolliginki
when
he
left
he
was
scared
to
death
to
come
he
was
the
first
man
from
that
country
to
go
abroad
he
thought
he
was
going
to
be
eaten
by
white
cannibals
or
something
you
know
what
those
niggers
ignorant
well
his
father
made
him
come
he
said
that
all
the
black
kings
were
sending
their
sons
to
oxford
now
it
was
the
fashion
and
he
would
have
to
go
bumpo
wanted
to
bring
his
six
wives
with
him
but
the
king
wouldn
t
let
him
do
that
either
poor
bumpo
went
off
in
everybody
in
the
palace
was
crying
too
you
never
heard
such
a
do
you
know
if
he
ever
went
back
in
search
of
the
sleeping
beauty
asked
the
doctor
oh
yes
said
the
day
after
you
left
and
a
good
thing
for
him
he
did
the
king
got
to
know
about
his
helping
you
to
escape
and
he
was
dreadfully
wild
about
and
the
sleeping
beauty
he
ever
find
her
well
he
brought
back
something
which
he
was
the
sleeping
beauty
myself
i
think
it
was
an
albino
niggeress
she
had
red
hair
and
the
biggest
feet
you
ever
saw
but
bumpo
was
no
end
pleased
with
her
and
finally
married
her
amid
great
rejoicings
the
feastings
lasted
seven
days
she
became
his
chief
wife
and
is
now
known
out
there
as
the
accent
the
last
and
tell
me
did
he
remain
white
only
for
about
three
months
said
the
parrot
after
that
his
face
slowly
returned
to
its
natural
color
it
was
just
as
well
he
was
so
conspicuous
in
his
the
way
he
was
with
his
face
white
and
the
rest
of
him
and
how
is
getting
on
added
the
doctor
in
explanation
to
me
was
a
pet
monkey
i
had
years
ago
i
left
him
too
in
africa
when
i
came
well
said
polynesia
frowning
is
not
entirely
happy
i
saw
a
good
deal
of
him
the
last
few
years
he
got
dreadfully
homesick
for
you
and
the
house
and
the
garden
it
s
funny
but
i
was
just
the
same
way
myself
you
remember
how
crazy
i
was
to
get
back
to
the
dear
old
land
and
africa
a
wonderful
don
t
care
what
anybody
says
well
i
thought
i
was
going
to
have
a
perfectly
grand
time
but
don
t
a
few
weeks
it
seemed
to
get
tiresome
i
just
couldn
t
seem
to
settle
down
well
to
make
a
long
story
short
one
night
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
d
come
back
here
and
find
you
so
i
hunted
up
old
and
told
him
about
it
he
said
he
didn
t
blame
me
a
exactly
the
same
way
himself

was
so
deadly
quiet
after
the
life
we
had
led
with
you
he
missed
the
stories
you
used
to
tell
us
out
of
your
animal
the
chats
we
used
to
have
sitting
round
the
on
winter
nights
the
animals
out
there
were
very
nice
to
us
and
all
that
but
somehow
the
dear
kind
creatures
seemed
a
bit
stupid
said
he
had
noticed
it
too
but
i
suppose
it
wasn
t
they
who
had
changed
it
was
we
who
were
different
when
i
left
poor
old
broke
down
and
cried
he
said
he
felt
as
though
his
only
friend
were
leaving
as
you
know
he
has
simply
millions
of
relatives
there
he
said
it
didn
t
seem
fair
that
i
should
have
wings
to
fly
over
here
any
time
i
liked
and
him
with
no
way
to
follow
me
but
mark
my
words
i
wouldn
t
be
a
bit
surprised
if
he
found
a
way
to
day
he
s
a
smart
lad
is
at
this
point
we
arrived
at
my
home
my
father
s
shop
was
closed
and
the
shutters
were
up
but
my
mother
was
standing
at
the
door
looking
down
the
street
good
evening
stubbins
said
the
doctor
it
is
my
fault
your
son
is
so
late
i
made
him
stay
to
supper
while
his
clothes
were
drying
he
was
soaked
to
the
skin
and
so
was
i
we
ran
into
one
another
in
the
storm
and
i
insisted
on
his
coming
into
my
house
for
i
was
beginning
to
get
worried
about
him
said
my
mother
i
am
thankful
to
you
sir
for
looking
after
him
so
well
and
bringing
him
don
t
mention
t
mention
it
said
the
doctor
we
have
had
a
very
interesting
who
might
it
be
that
i
have
the
honor
of
addressing
asked
my
mother
staring
at
the
gray
parrot
perched
on
the
doctor
s
shoulder
oh
i
m
john
dolittle
i
dare
say
your
husband
will
remember
me
he
made
me
some
very
excellent
boots
about
four
years
ago
they
really
are
splendid
added
the
doctor
gazing
down
at
his
feet
with
great
satisfaction
the
doctor
has
come
to
cure
my
squirrel
mother
said
i
he
knows
all
about
oh
no
said
the
doctor
not
all
stubbins
not
all
about
them
by
any
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
come
so
far
to
look
after
his
pet
said
my
mother
tom
is
always
bringing
home
strange
creatures
from
the
woods
and
the
is
he
said
the
doctor
perhaps
he
will
grow
up
to
be
a
naturalist
some
day
who
knows
won
t
you
come
in
asked
my
mother
the
place
is
a
little
untidy
because
i
haven
t
finished
the
spring
cleaning
yet
but
there
s
a
nice
fire
burning
in
the
thank
you
said
the
doctor
what
a
charming
home
you
have
and
after
wiping
his
enormous
boots
very
very
carefully
on
the
mat
the
great
man
passed
into
the
house
sixth
the
wounded
squirrel
inside
we
found
my
father
busy
practising
on
the
flute
beside
the
fire
this
he
always
did
every
evening
after
his
work
was
over
the
doctor
immediately
began
talking
to
him
about
flutes
and
piccolos
and
bassoons
and
presently
my
father
said
perhaps
you
perform
upon
the
flute
yourself
sir
won
t
you
play
us
a
tune
well
said
the
doctor
it
is
a
long
time
since
i
touched
the
instrument
but
i
would
like
to
try
may
i
then
the
doctor
took
the
flute
from
my
father
and
played
and
played
and
played
it
was
wonderful
my
mother
and
father
sat
as
still
as
statues
staring
up
at
the
ceiling
as
though
they
were
in
church
and
even
i
who
didn
t
bother
much
about
music
except
on
the
i
felt
all
sad
and
cold
and
creepy
and
wished
i
had
been
a
better
boy
oh
i
think
that
was
just
beautiful
sighed
my
mother
when
at
length
the
doctor
stopped
you
are
a
great
musician
sir
said
my
father
a
very
great
musician
won
t
you
please
play
us
something
else
why
certainly
said
the
oh
but
look
here
i
ve
forgotten
all
about
the
i
ll
show
him
to
you
i
said
he
is
upstairs
in
my
so
i
led
the
doctor
to
my
bedroom
at
the
top
of
the
house
and
showed
him
the
squirrel
in
the
filled
with
straw
the
animal
who
had
always
seemed
very
much
afraid
of
i
had
tried
hard
to
make
him
feel
at
home
sat
up
at
once
when
the
doctor
came
into
the
room
and
started
to
chatter
the
doctor
chattered
back
in
the
same
way
and
the
squirrel
when
he
was
lifted
up
to
have
his
leg
examined
appeared
to
be
rather
pleased
than
frightened
i
held
a
candle
while
the
doctor
tied
the
leg
up
in
what
he
called
splints
which
he
made
out
of
with
his
i
think
you
will
find
that
his
leg
will
get
better
now
in
a
very
short
time
said
the
doctor
closing
up
his
bag
don
t
let
him
run
about
for
at
least
two
weeks
yet
but
keep
him
in
the
open
air
and
cover
him
up
with
dry
leaves
if
the
nights
get
cool
he
tells
me
he
is
rather
lonely
here
all
by
himself
and
is
wondering
how
his
wife
and
children
are
getting
on
i
have
assured
him
you
are
a
man
to
be
trusted
and
i
will
send
a
squirrel
who
lives
in
my
garden
to
find
out
how
his
family
are
and
to
bring
him
news
of
them
he
must
be
kept
cheerful
at
all
costs
squirrels
are
naturally
a
very
cheerful
active
race
it
is
very
hard
for
them
to
lie
still
doing
nothing
but
you
needn
t
worry
about
him
he
will
be
all
then
we
went
back
again
to
the
parlor
and
my
mother
and
father
kept
him
playing
the
flute
till
after
ten
o
clock
although
my
parents
both
liked
the
doctor
tremendously
from
the
first
moment
that
they
saw
him
and
were
very
proud
to
have
him
come
and
play
to
us
for
we
were
really
terribly
poor
they
did
not
realize
then
what
a
truly
great
man
he
was
one
day
to
become
of
course
now
when
almost
everybody
in
the
whole
world
has
heard
about
doctor
dolittle
and
his
books
if
you
were
to
go
to
that
little
house
in
puddleby
where
my
father
had
his
cobbler
s
shop
you
would
see
set
in
the
wall
over
the
door
a
stone
with
writing
on
it
which
says
john
dolittle
the
famous
naturalist
played
the
flute
in
this
house
in
the
year
i
often
look
back
upon
that
night
long
long
ago
and
if
i
close
my
eyes
and
think
hard
i
can
see
that
parlor
just
as
it
was
then
a
funny
little
man
in
with
a
round
kind
face
playing
away
on
the
flute
in
front
of
the
fire
my
mother
on
one
side
of
him
and
my
father
on
the
other
holding
their
breath
and
listening
with
their
eyes
shut
myself
with
jip
squatting
on
the
carpet
at
his
feet
staring
into
the
coals
and
polynesia
perched
on
the
mantlepiece
beside
his
shabby
high
hat
gravely
swinging
her
head
from
side
to
side
in
time
to
the
music
i
see
it
all
just
as
though
it
were
before
me
now
and
then
i
remember
how
after
we
had
seen
the
doctor
out
at
the
front
door
we
all
came
back
into
the
parlor
and
talked
about
him
till
it
was
still
later
and
even
after
i
did
go
to
bed
i
had
never
stayed
up
so
late
in
my
life
before
i
dreamed
about
him
and
a
band
of
strange
clever
animals
that
played
flutes
and
fiddles
and
drums
the
whole
night
through
seventh
shellfish
talk
the
next
morning
although
i
had
gone
to
bed
so
late
the
night
before
i
was
up
frightfully
early
the
first
sparrows
were
just
beginning
to
chirp
sleepily
on
the
slates
outside
my
attic
window
when
i
jumped
out
of
bed
and
scrambled
into
my
clothes
i
could
hardly
wait
to
get
back
to
the
little
house
with
the
big
see
the
doctor
and
his
private
zoo
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
forgot
all
about
breakfast
and
creeping
down
the
stairs
on
so
as
not
to
wake
my
mother
and
father
i
opened
the
front
door
and
popped
out
into
the
empty
silent
street
when
i
got
to
the
doctor
s
gate
i
suddenly
thought
that
perhaps
it
was
too
early
to
call
on
any
one
and
i
began
to
wonder
if
the
doctor
would
be
up
yet
i
looked
into
the
garden
no
one
seemed
to
be
about
so
i
opened
the
gate
quietly
and
went
inside
as
i
turned
to
the
left
to
go
down
a
path
between
some
hedges
i
heard
a
voice
quite
close
to
me
say
good
morning
how
early
you
are
i
turned
around
and
there
sitting
on
the
top
of
a
privet
hedge
was
the
gray
parrot
polynesia
good
morning
i
said
i
suppose
i
am
rather
early
is
the
doctor
still
in
bed
oh
no
said
polynesia
he
has
been
up
an
hour
and
a
half
you
ll
find
him
in
the
house
somewhere
the
front
door
is
open
just
push
it
and
go
in
he
is
sure
to
be
in
the
kitchen
cooking
working
in
his
study
walk
right
in
i
am
waiting
to
see
the
sun
rise
but
upon
my
word
i
believe
it
s
forgotten
to
rise
it
is
an
awful
climate
this
now
if
we
were
in
africa
the
world
would
be
blazing
with
sunlight
at
this
hour
of
the
morning
just
see
that
mist
rolling
over
those
cabbages
it
is
enough
to
give
you
rheumatism
to
look
at
it
beastly
really
i
don
t
know
why
anything
but
frogs
ever
stay
in
don
t
let
me
keep
you
run
along
and
see
the
thank
you
i
said
i
ll
go
and
look
for
when
i
opened
the
front
door
i
could
smell
bacon
frying
so
i
made
my
way
to
the
kitchen
there
i
discovered
a
large
kettle
boiling
away
over
the
fire
and
some
bacon
and
eggs
in
a
dish
upon
the
hearth
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
bacon
was
getting
all
dried
up
with
the
heat
so
i
pulled
the
dish
a
little
further
away
from
the
fire
and
went
on
through
the
house
looking
for
the
doctor
i
found
him
at
last
in
the
study
i
did
not
know
then
that
it
was
called
the
study
it
was
certainly
a
very
interesting
room
with
telescopes
and
microscopes
and
all
sorts
of
other
strange
things
which
i
did
not
understand
about
but
wished
i
did
hanging
on
the
walls
were
pictures
of
animals
and
fishes
and
strange
plants
and
collections
of
birds
eggs
and
in
glass
cases
the
doctor
was
standing
at
the
main
table
in
his
at
first
i
thought
he
was
washing
his
face
he
had
a
square
glass
box
before
him
full
of
water
he
was
holding
one
ear
under
the
water
while
he
covered
the
other
with
his
left
hand
as
i
came
in
he
stood
up
good
morning
stubbins
said
he
going
to
be
a
nice
day
don
t
you
think
i
ve
just
been
listening
to
the
but
he
is
very
why
i
said
didn
t
you
find
that
he
has
any
language
at
all
oh
yes
said
the
doctor
he
has
a
language
but
it
is
such
a
poor
a
few
words
like
yes
and
no
hot
and
that
s
all
he
can
say
it
s
very
disappointing
you
see
he
really
belongs
to
two
different
families
of
fishes
i
thought
he
was
going
to
be
tremendously
well
i
suppose
said
i
that
means
he
hasn
t
very
much
his
language
is
only
two
or
three
words
yes
i
suppose
it
does
possibly
it
is
the
kind
of
life
he
leads
you
see
they
are
very
rare
now
these
rare
and
very
solitary
they
swim
around
in
the
deepest
parts
of
the
ocean
entirely
by
alone
so
i
presume
they
really
don
t
need
to
talk
perhaps
some
kind
of
a
bigger
shellfish
would
talk
more
i
said
after
all
he
is
very
small
isn
t
he
yes
said
the
doctor
that
s
true
oh
i
have
no
doubt
that
there
are
shellfish
who
are
good
the
least
doubt
but
the
big
biggest
of
them
are
so
hard
to
catch
they
are
only
to
be
found
in
the
deep
parts
of
the
sea
and
as
they
don
t
swim
very
much
but
just
crawl
along
the
floor
of
the
ocean
most
of
the
time
they
are
very
seldom
taken
in
nets
i
do
wish
i
could
find
some
way
of
going
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
i
could
learn
a
lot
if
i
could
only
do
that
but
we
are
forgetting
all
about
you
had
breakfast
yet
stubbins
i
told
the
doctor
that
i
had
forgotten
all
about
it
and
he
at
once
led
the
way
into
the
kitchen
yes
he
said
as
he
poured
the
hot
water
from
the
kettle
into
the
if
a
man
could
only
manage
to
get
right
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
live
there
a
while
he
would
discover
some
wonderful
that
people
have
never
dreamed
but
men
do
go
down
don
t
they
i
divers
and
people
like
that
oh
yes
to
be
sure
said
the
doctor
divers
go
down
i
ve
been
down
myself
in
a
for
that
matter
but
my
only
go
where
the
sea
is
shallow
divers
can
t
go
down
where
it
is
really
deep
what
i
would
like
to
do
is
to
go
down
to
the
great
it
is
miles
well
i
dare
say
i
shall
manage
it
some
day
let
me
give
you
another
cup
of
eighth
are
you
a
good
noticer
just
at
that
moment
polynesia
came
into
the
room
and
said
something
to
the
doctor
in
bird
language
of
course
i
did
not
understand
what
it
was
but
the
doctor
at
once
put
down
his
knife
and
fork
and
left
the
room
you
know
it
is
an
awful
shame
said
the
parrot
as
soon
as
the
doctor
had
closed
the
door
directly
he
comes
back
home
all
the
animals
over
the
whole
countryside
get
to
hear
of
it
and
every
sick
cat
and
mangy
rabbit
for
miles
around
comes
to
see
him
and
ask
his
advice
now
there
s
a
big
fat
hare
outside
at
the
back
door
with
a
squawking
baby
can
she
see
the
doctor
please
it
s
going
to
have
convulsions
stupid
little
thing
s
been
eating
deadly
nightshade
again
i
suppose
the
animals
are
inconsiderate
at
the
mothers
they
come
round
and
call
the
doctor
away
from
his
meals
and
wake
him
out
of
his
bed
at
all
hours
of
the
night
i
don
t
know
how
he
stands
i
don
t
why
the
poor
man
never
gets
any
peace
at
all
i
ve
told
him
time
and
again
to
have
special
hours
for
the
animals
to
come
but
he
is
so
frightfully
kind
and
considerate
he
never
refuses
to
see
them
if
there
is
anything
really
wrong
with
them
he
says
the
urgent
cases
must
be
seen
at
why
don
t
some
of
the
animals
go
and
see
the
other
doctors
i
asked
oh
good
gracious
exclaimed
the
parrot
tossing
her
head
scornfully
why
there
aren
t
any
other
real
doctors
oh
of
course
there
those
vet
persons
to
be
sure
but
bless
you
they
re
no
good
you
see
they
can
t
understand
the
animals
language
so
how
can
you
expect
them
to
be
any
use
imagine
yourself
or
your
father
going
to
see
a
doctor
who
could
not
understand
a
word
you
even
tell
you
in
your
own
language
what
you
must
do
to
get
well
poof
vets
they
re
that
stupid
you
ve
no
idea
the
doctor
s
bacon
down
by
the
fire
will
you
keep
hot
till
he
comes
do
you
think
i
would
ever
be
able
to
learn
the
language
of
the
animals
i
asked
laying
the
plate
upon
the
hearth
well
it
all
depends
said
polynesia
are
you
clever
at
lessons
i
don
t
know
i
answered
feeling
rather
ashamed
you
see
i
ve
never
been
to
school
my
father
is
too
poor
to
send
well
said
the
parrot
i
don
t
suppose
you
have
really
missed
judge
from
what
have
seen
of
but
listen
are
you
a
good
noticer
you
notice
things
well
i
mean
for
instance
supposing
you
saw
two
on
an
and
you
only
took
one
good
look
at
you
be
able
to
tell
one
from
the
other
if
you
saw
them
again
the
next
day
i
don
t
know
i
said
i
ve
never
well
that
said
polynesia
brushing
some
crumbs
off
the
corner
of
the
table
with
her
left
that
is
what
you
call
powers
of
the
small
things
about
birds
and
animals
the
way
they
walk
and
move
their
heads
and
flip
their
wings
the
way
they
sniff
the
air
and
twitch
their
whiskers
and
wiggle
their
tails
you
have
to
notice
all
those
little
things
if
you
want
to
learn
animal
language
for
you
see
lots
of
the
animals
hardly
talk
at
all
with
their
tongues
they
use
their
breath
or
their
tails
or
their
feet
instead
that
is
because
many
of
them
in
the
olden
days
when
lions
and
tigers
were
more
plentiful
were
afraid
to
make
a
noise
for
fear
the
savage
creatures
heard
them
birds
of
course
didn
t
care
for
they
always
had
wings
to
fly
away
with
but
that
is
the
first
thing
to
remember
being
a
good
noticer
is
terribly
important
in
learning
animal
it
sounds
pretty
hard
i
said
you
ll
have
to
be
very
patient
said
polynesia
it
takes
a
long
time
to
say
even
a
few
words
properly
but
if
you
come
here
often
i
ll
give
you
a
few
lessons
myself
and
once
you
get
started
you
ll
be
surprised
how
fast
you
get
on
it
would
indeed
be
a
good
thing
if
you
could
learn
because
then
you
could
do
some
of
the
work
for
the
mean
the
easier
work
like
bandaging
and
giving
pills
yes
yes
that
s
a
good
idea
of
mine
twould
be
a
great
thing
if
the
poor
man
could
get
some
some
rest
it
is
a
scandal
the
way
he
works
i
see
no
reason
why
you
shouldn
t
be
able
to
help
him
a
great
is
if
you
are
really
interested
in
illustration
being
a
good
noticer
is
terribly
important
oh
i
d
love
that
i
cried
do
you
think
the
doctor
would
let
me
certainly
said
as
soon
as
you
have
learned
something
about
doctoring
i
ll
speak
of
it
to
him
i
hear
him
coming
his
bacon
back
on
to
the
ninth
the
garden
of
dreams
when
breakfast
was
over
the
doctor
took
me
out
to
show
me
the
garden
well
if
the
house
had
been
interesting
the
garden
was
a
hundred
times
more
so
of
all
the
gardens
i
have
ever
seen
that
was
the
most
delightful
the
most
fascinating
at
first
you
did
not
realize
how
big
it
was
you
never
seemed
to
come
to
the
end
of
it
when
at
last
you
were
quite
sure
that
you
had
seen
it
all
you
would
peer
over
a
hedge
or
turn
a
corner
or
look
up
some
steps
and
there
was
a
whole
new
part
you
never
expected
to
find
it
had
a
garden
can
have
or
ever
has
had
there
were
wide
wide
lawns
with
carved
stone
seats
green
with
moss
over
the
lawns
hung
and
their
feathery
brushed
the
velvet
grass
when
they
swung
with
the
wind
the
old
flagged
paths
had
high
clipped
yew
hedges
either
side
of
them
so
that
they
looked
like
the
narrow
streets
of
some
old
town
and
through
the
hedges
doorways
had
been
made
and
over
the
doorways
were
shapes
like
vases
and
peacocks
and
all
trimmed
out
of
the
living
trees
there
was
a
lovely
marble
with
golden
carp
and
blue
in
it
and
big
green
frogs
a
high
brick
wall
alongside
the
kitchen
garden
was
all
covered
with
pink
and
yellow
peaches
ripening
in
the
sun
there
was
a
wonderful
great
oak
hollow
in
the
trunk
big
enough
for
four
men
to
hide
inside
many
there
were
of
wood
and
some
of
stone
and
one
of
them
was
full
of
books
to
read
in
a
corner
among
some
rocks
and
ferns
was
an
outdoor
where
the
doctor
used
to
fry
liver
and
bacon
when
he
had
a
notion
to
take
his
meals
in
the
open
air
there
was
a
couch
as
well
on
which
he
used
to
sleep
it
seems
on
warm
summer
nights
when
the
nightingales
were
singing
at
their
best
it
had
wheels
on
it
so
it
could
be
moved
about
under
any
tree
they
sang
in
but
the
thing
that
fascinated
me
most
of
all
was
a
tiny
little
high
up
in
the
top
branches
of
a
great
elm
with
a
long
rope
ladder
leading
to
it
the
doctor
told
me
he
used
it
for
looking
at
the
moon
and
the
stars
through
a
telescope
it
was
the
kind
of
a
garden
where
you
could
wander
and
explore
for
days
and
coming
upon
something
new
always
glad
to
find
the
old
spots
over
again
that
first
time
that
i
saw
the
doctor
s
garden
i
was
so
charmed
by
it
that
i
felt
i
would
like
to
live
in
and
never
go
outside
of
it
again
for
it
had
everything
within
its
walls
to
give
happiness
to
make
living
keep
the
heart
at
peace
it
was
the
garden
of
dreams
one
peculiar
thing
i
noticed
immediately
i
came
into
it
and
that
was
what
a
lot
of
birds
there
were
about
every
tree
seemed
to
have
two
or
three
nests
in
it
and
heaps
of
other
wild
creatures
appeared
to
be
making
themselves
at
home
there
too
stoats
and
tortoises
and
dormice
seemed
to
be
quite
common
and
not
in
the
least
shy
toads
of
different
colors
and
sizes
hopped
about
the
lawn
as
though
it
belonged
to
them
green
lizards
which
were
very
rare
in
puddleby
sat
up
on
the
stones
in
the
sunlight
and
blinked
at
us
even
snakes
were
to
be
seen
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
them
said
the
doctor
noticing
that
i
started
somewhat
when
a
large
black
snake
wiggled
across
the
path
right
in
front
of
us
these
fellows
are
not
poisonous
they
do
a
great
deal
of
good
in
keeping
down
many
kinds
of
i
play
the
flute
to
them
sometimes
in
the
evening
they
love
it
stand
right
up
on
their
tails
and
carry
on
no
end
funny
thing
their
taste
for
why
do
all
these
animals
come
and
live
here
i
asked
i
never
saw
a
garden
with
so
many
creatures
in
well
i
suppose
it
s
because
they
get
the
kind
of
food
they
like
and
nobody
worries
or
disturbs
them
and
then
of
course
they
know
me
and
if
they
or
their
children
get
sick
i
presume
they
find
it
handy
to
be
living
in
a
doctor
s
you
see
that
sparrow
on
the
sundial
swearing
at
the
blackbird
down
below
well
he
has
been
coming
here
every
summer
for
years
he
comes
from
london
the
country
sparrows
round
about
here
are
always
laughing
at
him
they
say
he
chirps
with
such
a
cockney
accent
he
is
a
most
amusing
brave
but
very
cheeky
he
loves
nothing
better
than
an
argument
but
he
always
ends
it
by
getting
rude
he
is
a
real
city
bird
in
london
he
lives
around
paul
s
cathedral
cheapside
we
call
are
all
these
birds
from
the
country
round
here
i
asked
most
of
them
said
the
doctor
but
a
few
rare
ones
visit
me
every
year
who
ordinarily
never
come
near
england
at
all
for
instance
that
handsome
little
fellow
hovering
over
the
snapdragon
there
he
s
a
comes
from
america
strictly
speaking
he
has
no
business
in
this
climate
at
all
it
is
too
cool
i
make
him
sleep
in
the
kitchen
at
night
then
every
august
about
the
last
week
of
the
month
i
have
a
purple
come
all
the
way
from
brazil
to
see
me
she
is
a
very
great
swell
hasn
t
arrived
yet
of
course
and
there
are
a
few
others
foreign
birds
from
the
tropics
mostly
who
drop
in
on
me
in
the
course
of
the
summer
months
but
come
i
must
show
you
the
tenth
the
private
zoo
i
did
not
think
there
could
be
anything
left
in
that
garden
which
we
had
not
seen
but
the
doctor
took
me
by
the
arm
and
started
off
down
a
little
narrow
path
and
after
many
windings
and
twistings
and
turnings
we
found
ourselves
before
a
small
door
in
a
high
stone
wall
the
doctor
pushed
it
open
inside
was
still
another
garden
i
had
expected
to
find
cages
with
animals
inside
them
but
there
were
none
to
be
seen
instead
there
were
little
stone
houses
here
and
there
all
over
the
garden
and
each
house
had
a
window
and
a
door
as
we
walked
in
many
of
these
doors
opened
and
animals
came
running
out
to
us
evidently
expecting
food
haven
t
the
doors
any
locks
on
them
i
asked
the
doctor
oh
yes
he
said
every
door
has
a
lock
but
in
my
zoo
the
doors
open
from
the
inside
not
from
the
out
the
locks
are
only
there
so
the
animals
can
go
and
shut
themselves
any
time
they
want
to
get
away
from
the
annoyance
of
other
animals
or
from
people
who
might
come
here
every
animal
in
this
zoo
stays
here
because
he
likes
it
not
because
he
is
made
they
all
look
very
happy
and
clean
i
said
would
you
mind
telling
me
the
names
of
some
of
them
certainly
well
now
that
thing
with
plates
on
his
back
nosing
under
the
brick
over
there
is
a
south
american
armadillo
the
little
chap
talking
to
him
is
a
canadian
woodchuck
they
both
live
in
those
holes
you
see
at
the
foot
of
the
wall
the
two
little
beasts
doing
antics
in
the
pond
are
a
pair
of
russian
that
reminds
me
i
must
go
and
get
them
some
herrings
from
the
town
before
is
that
animal
just
stepping
out
of
his
house
is
an
antelope
one
of
the
smaller
south
african
kinds
now
let
us
move
to
the
other
side
of
those
bushes
there
and
i
will
show
you
some
are
those
deer
over
there
i
asked
said
the
doctor
where
do
you
mean
over
there
i
said
nibbling
the
grass
border
of
the
bed
there
are
two
of
oh
that
said
the
doctor
with
a
smile
that
isn
t
two
animals
that
s
one
animal
with
two
only
animal
in
the
world
it
s
called
the
i
brought
him
from
africa
he
s
very
as
a
kind
of
for
my
zoo
he
only
sleeps
with
one
head
at
a
time
you
other
head
stays
awake
all
have
you
any
lions
or
tigers
i
asked
as
we
moved
on
no
said
the
doctor
it
wouldn
t
be
possible
to
keep
them
i
wouldn
t
keep
them
even
if
i
could
if
i
had
my
way
stubbins
there
wouldn
t
be
a
single
lion
or
tiger
in
captivity
anywhere
in
the
world
they
never
take
to
it
they
re
never
happy
they
never
settle
down
they
are
always
thinking
of
the
big
countries
they
have
left
behind
you
can
see
it
in
their
eyes
always
of
the
great
open
spaces
where
they
were
born
dreaming
of
the
deep
dark
jungles
where
their
mothers
first
taught
them
how
to
scent
and
track
the
deer
and
what
are
they
given
in
exchange
for
all
this
asked
the
doctor
stopping
in
his
walk
and
growing
all
red
and
what
are
they
given
in
exchange
for
the
glory
of
an
african
sunrise
for
the
twilight
breeze
whispering
through
the
palms
for
the
green
shade
of
the
matted
tangled
vines
for
the
cool
nights
of
the
desert
for
the
patter
of
the
waterfall
after
a
hard
day
s
hunt
what
i
ask
you
are
they
given
in
exchange
for
why
a
bare
cage
with
iron
bars
an
ugly
piece
of
dead
meat
thrust
in
to
them
once
a
day
and
a
crowd
of
fools
to
come
and
stare
at
them
with
open
mouths
stubbins
lions
and
tigers
the
big
hunters
should
never
never
be
seen
in
the
doctor
seemed
to
have
grown
terribly
sad
but
suddenly
his
manner
changed
again
and
he
took
me
by
the
arm
with
his
same
old
cheerful
smile
but
we
haven
t
seen
the
the
aquariums
come
along
i
am
very
proud
of
my
off
we
went
again
and
came
presently
into
a
hedged
enclosure
here
i
saw
several
big
huts
made
of
fine
wire
netting
like
cages
inside
the
netting
all
sorts
of
beautiful
flowers
were
growing
in
the
sun
with
butterflies
skimming
over
them
the
doctor
pointed
to
the
end
of
one
of
the
huts
where
little
boxes
with
holes
in
them
stood
in
a
row
those
are
the
said
he
there
i
put
the
different
kinds
of
caterpillars
and
as
soon
as
they
turn
into
butterflies
and
moths
they
come
out
into
these
to
do
butterflies
have
a
language
i
asked
oh
i
fancy
they
have
said
the
and
the
beetles
too
but
so
far
i
haven
t
succeeded
in
learning
much
about
insect
languages
i
have
been
too
busy
lately
trying
to
master
the
i
mean
to
take
it
up
at
that
moment
polynesia
joined
us
and
said
doctor
there
are
two
at
the
back
door
they
say
they
have
run
away
from
the
boy
who
kept
them
because
they
didn
t
get
the
right
stuff
to
eat
they
want
to
know
if
you
will
take
them
all
right
said
the
doctor
show
them
the
way
to
the
zoo
give
them
the
house
on
the
left
near
the
one
the
black
fox
had
tell
them
what
the
rules
are
and
give
them
a
square
stubbins
we
will
go
on
to
the
aquariums
and
first
of
all
i
must
show
you
my
big
glass
tank
where
i
keep
the
eleventh
my
schoolmaster
polynesia
well
there
were
not
many
days
after
that
you
may
be
sure
when
i
did
not
come
to
see
my
new
friend
indeed
i
was
at
his
house
practically
all
day
and
every
day
so
that
one
evening
my
mother
asked
me
jokingly
why
i
did
not
take
my
bed
over
there
and
live
at
the
doctor
s
house
altogether
after
a
while
i
think
i
got
to
be
quite
useful
to
the
doctor
feeding
his
pets
for
him
helping
to
make
new
houses
and
fences
for
the
zoo
assisting
with
the
sick
animals
that
came
doing
all
manner
of
odd
jobs
about
the
place
so
that
although
i
enjoyed
it
all
very
much
it
was
indeed
like
living
in
a
new
world
i
really
think
the
doctor
would
have
missed
me
if
i
had
not
come
so
often
and
all
this
time
polynesia
came
with
me
wherever
i
went
teaching
me
bird
language
and
showing
me
how
to
understand
the
talking
signs
of
the
animals
at
first
i
thought
i
would
never
be
able
to
learn
at
seemed
so
difficult
but
the
old
parrot
was
wonderfully
patient
with
i
could
see
that
occasionally
she
had
hard
work
to
keep
her
temper
soon
i
began
to
pick
up
the
strange
chatter
of
the
birds
and
to
understand
the
funny
talking
antics
of
the
dogs
i
used
to
practise
listening
to
the
mice
behind
the
wainscot
after
i
went
to
bed
and
watching
the
cats
on
the
roofs
and
pigeons
in
the
of
puddleby
and
the
days
passed
very
they
always
do
when
life
is
pleasant
and
the
days
turned
into
weeks
and
weeks
into
months
and
soon
the
roses
in
the
doctor
s
garden
were
losing
their
petals
and
yellow
leaves
lay
upon
the
wide
green
lawn
for
the
summer
was
nearly
gone
one
day
polynesia
and
i
were
talking
in
the
library
this
was
a
fine
long
room
with
a
grand
mantlepiece
and
the
walls
were
covered
from
the
ceiling
to
the
floor
with
shelves
full
of
books
books
of
stories
books
on
gardening
books
about
medicine
books
of
travel
these
i
especially
the
doctor
s
great
atlas
with
all
its
maps
of
the
different
countries
of
the
world
this
afternoon
polynesia
was
showing
me
the
books
about
animals
which
john
dolittle
had
written
himself
my
i
said
what
a
lot
of
books
the
doctor
the
way
around
the
room
goodness
i
wish
i
could
read
it
must
be
tremendously
interesting
can
you
read
polynesia
only
a
little
said
she
be
careful
how
you
turn
those
t
tear
them
no
i
really
don
t
get
time
enough
for
that
letter
there
is
a
and
this
is
a
what
does
this
word
under
the
picture
mean
i
asked
let
me
see
she
said
and
started
spelling
it
out
s
reading
isn
t
nearly
as
hard
as
it
looks
once
you
know
the
polynesia
i
said
i
want
to
ask
you
something
very
what
is
it
my
boy
said
she
smoothing
down
the
feathers
of
her
right
wing
polynesia
often
spoke
to
me
in
a
very
patronizing
way
but
i
did
not
mind
it
from
her
after
all
she
was
nearly
two
hundred
years
old
and
i
was
only
ten
listen
i
said
my
mother
doesn
t
think
it
is
right
that
i
come
here
for
so
many
meals
and
i
was
going
to
ask
you
supposing
i
did
a
whole
lot
more
work
for
the
couldn
t
i
come
and
live
here
altogether
you
see
instead
of
being
paid
like
a
regular
gardener
or
workman
i
would
get
my
bed
and
meals
in
exchange
for
the
work
i
did
what
do
you
think
you
mean
you
want
to
be
a
proper
assistant
to
the
doctor
is
that
it
yes
i
suppose
that
s
what
you
call
it
i
answered
you
know
you
said
yourself
that
you
thought
i
could
be
very
useful
to
well
thought
a
i
really
don
t
see
why
not
but
is
this
what
you
want
to
be
when
you
grow
up
a
naturalist
yes
i
said
i
have
made
up
my
mind
i
would
sooner
be
a
naturalist
than
anything
else
in
the
humph
s
go
and
speak
to
the
doctor
about
it
said
polynesia
he
s
in
the
next
the
study
open
the
door
very
may
be
working
and
not
want
to
be
i
opened
the
door
quietly
and
peeped
in
the
first
thing
i
saw
was
an
enormous
black
retriever
dog
sitting
in
the
middle
of
the
with
his
ears
cocked
up
listening
to
the
doctor
who
was
reading
aloud
to
him
from
a
letter
what
the
doctor
doing
i
asked
polynesia
in
a
whisper
oh
the
dog
has
had
a
letter
from
his
mistress
and
he
has
brought
it
to
the
doctor
to
read
for
him
that
s
all
he
belongs
to
a
funny
little
girl
called
minnie
dooley
who
lives
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
she
has
pigtails
down
her
back
she
and
her
brother
have
gone
away
to
the
seaside
for
the
summer
and
the
old
retriever
is
while
the
children
are
gone
so
they
write
letters
to
english
of
course
and
as
the
old
dog
doesn
t
understand
them
he
brings
them
here
and
the
doctor
turns
them
into
dog
language
for
him
i
think
minnie
must
have
written
that
she
is
coming
judge
from
the
dog
s
excitement
just
look
at
him
carrying
on
indeed
the
retriever
seemed
to
be
suddenly
overcome
with
joy
as
the
doctor
finished
the
letter
the
old
dog
started
barking
at
the
top
of
his
voice
wagging
his
tail
wildly
and
jumping
about
the
study
he
took
the
letter
in
his
mouth
and
ran
out
of
the
room
snorting
hard
and
mumbling
to
himself
he
s
going
down
to
meet
the
coach
whispered
polynesia
that
dog
s
devotion
to
those
children
is
more
than
i
can
understand
you
should
see
minnie
she
s
the
most
conceited
little
minx
that
ever
walked
she
squints
twelfth
my
great
idea
presently
the
doctor
looked
up
and
saw
us
at
the
door
in
stubbins
said
he
did
you
wish
to
speak
to
me
come
in
and
take
a
doctor
i
said
i
want
to
be
a
i
grow
oh
you
do
do
you
murmured
the
doctor
humph
me
don
t
say
well
have
you
you
spoken
to
your
mother
and
father
about
it
no
not
yet
i
said
i
want
you
to
speak
to
them
for
me
you
would
do
it
better
i
want
to
be
your
assistant
if
you
ll
have
me
last
night
my
mother
was
saying
that
she
didn
t
consider
it
right
for
me
to
come
here
so
often
for
meals
and
i
ve
been
thinking
about
it
a
good
deal
since
couldn
t
we
make
some
t
i
work
for
my
meals
and
sleep
here
but
my
dear
stubbins
said
the
doctor
laughing
you
are
quite
welcome
to
come
here
for
three
meals
a
day
all
the
year
round
i
m
only
too
glad
to
have
you
besides
you
do
do
a
lot
of
work
as
it
is
i
ve
often
felt
that
i
ought
to
pay
you
for
what
you
what
arrangement
was
it
that
you
thought
of
well
i
thought
said
i
that
perhaps
you
would
come
and
see
my
mother
and
father
and
tell
them
that
if
they
let
me
live
here
with
you
and
work
hard
that
you
will
teach
me
to
read
and
write
you
see
my
mother
is
awfully
anxious
to
have
me
learn
reading
and
writing
and
besides
i
couldn
t
be
a
proper
naturalist
without
could
i
oh
i
don
t
know
so
much
about
that
said
the
doctor
it
is
nice
i
admit
to
be
able
to
read
and
write
but
naturalists
are
not
all
alike
you
know
for
example
this
young
fellow
charles
darwin
that
people
are
talking
about
so
much
s
a
cambridge
and
writes
very
well
and
then
used
to
be
a
tutor
but
listen
the
greatest
naturalist
of
them
all
doesn
t
even
know
how
to
write
his
own
name
nor
to
read
the
b
who
is
he
i
asked
he
is
a
mysterious
person
said
the
a
very
mysterious
person
his
name
is
long
arrow
the
son
of
golden
arrow
he
is
a
red
have
you
ever
seen
him
i
asked
no
said
the
doctor
i
ve
never
seen
him
no
white
man
has
ever
met
him
i
fancy
darwin
doesn
t
even
know
that
he
exists
he
lives
almost
entirely
with
the
animals
and
with
the
different
tribes
of
somewhere
among
the
mountains
of
peru
never
stays
long
in
one
place
goes
from
tribe
to
tribe
like
a
sort
of
indian
how
do
you
know
so
much
about
him
i
if
you
ve
never
even
seen
him
the
purple
said
the
she
told
me
all
about
him
she
says
he
is
a
perfectly
marvelous
naturalist
i
got
her
to
take
a
message
to
him
for
me
last
time
she
was
here
i
am
expecting
her
back
any
day
now
i
can
hardly
wait
to
see
what
answer
she
has
brought
from
him
it
is
already
almost
the
last
week
of
august
i
do
hope
nothing
has
happened
to
her
on
the
but
why
do
the
animals
and
birds
come
to
you
when
they
are
sick
i
why
don
t
they
go
to
him
if
he
is
so
very
wonderful
it
seems
that
my
methods
are
more
up
to
date
said
the
doctor
but
from
what
the
purple
tells
me
long
arrow
s
knowledge
of
natural
history
must
be
positively
tremendous
his
specialty
is
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
he
knows
a
lot
about
birds
and
animals
too
he
s
very
good
on
bees
and
now
tell
me
stubbins
are
you
quite
sure
that
you
really
want
to
be
a
naturalist
yes
said
i
my
mind
is
made
well
you
know
it
isn
t
a
very
good
profession
for
making
money
not
at
all
it
isn
t
most
of
the
good
naturalists
don
t
make
any
money
whatever
all
they
do
is
money
buying
and
cases
for
birds
eggs
and
things
it
is
only
now
after
i
have
been
a
naturalist
for
many
years
that
i
am
beginning
to
make
a
little
money
from
the
books
i
i
don
t
care
about
money
i
said
i
want
to
be
a
naturalist
won
t
you
please
come
and
have
dinner
with
my
mother
and
father
next
told
them
i
was
going
to
ask
then
you
can
talk
to
them
about
it
you
see
there
s
another
thing
if
i
m
living
with
you
and
sort
of
belong
to
your
house
and
business
i
shall
be
able
to
come
with
you
next
time
you
go
on
a
oh
i
see
said
he
smiling
so
you
want
to
come
on
a
voyage
with
me
do
you
hah
i
want
to
go
on
all
your
voyages
with
you
it
would
be
much
easier
for
you
if
you
had
someone
to
carry
the
and
wouldn
t
it
now
for
a
long
time
the
doctor
sat
thinking
drumming
on
the
desk
with
his
fingers
while
i
waited
terribly
impatiently
to
see
what
he
was
going
to
say
at
last
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
stood
up
well
stubbins
said
he
i
ll
come
and
talk
it
over
with
you
and
your
parents
next
thursday
we
ll
see
we
ll
see
give
your
mother
and
father
my
compliments
and
thank
them
for
their
invitation
will
you
then
i
tore
home
like
the
wind
to
tell
my
mother
that
the
doctor
had
promised
to
come
thirteenth
a
traveler
arrives
the
next
day
i
was
sitting
on
the
wall
of
the
doctor
s
garden
after
tea
talking
to
i
had
now
learned
so
much
from
polynesia
that
i
could
talk
to
most
birds
and
some
animals
without
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
i
found
a
very
nice
old
motherly
not
nearly
so
clever
and
interesting
as
polynesia
she
had
been
housekeeper
for
the
doctor
many
years
now
well
as
i
was
saying
the
old
duck
and
i
were
sitting
on
the
flat
top
of
the
that
evening
looking
down
into
the
oxenthorpe
road
below
we
were
watching
some
sheep
being
driven
to
market
in
puddleby
and
had
just
been
telling
me
about
the
doctor
s
adventures
in
africa
for
she
had
gone
on
a
voyage
with
him
to
that
country
long
ago
suddenly
i
heard
a
curious
distant
noise
down
the
road
towards
the
town
it
sounded
like
a
lot
of
people
cheering
i
stood
up
on
the
wall
to
see
if
i
could
make
out
what
was
coming
presently
there
appeared
round
a
bend
a
great
crowd
of
following
a
very
ragged
woman
what
in
the
world
can
it
be
cried
the
children
were
all
laughing
and
shouting
and
certainly
the
woman
they
were
following
was
most
extraordinary
she
had
very
long
arms
and
the
most
stooping
shoulders
i
have
ever
seen
she
wore
a
straw
hat
on
the
side
of
her
head
with
poppies
on
it
and
her
skirt
was
so
long
for
her
it
dragged
on
the
ground
like
a
s
train
i
could
not
see
anything
of
her
face
because
of
the
wide
hat
pulled
over
her
eyes
but
as
she
got
nearer
to
us
and
the
laughing
of
the
children
grew
louder
i
noticed
that
her
hands
were
very
dark
in
color
and
hairy
like
a
witch
s
then
all
of
a
sudden
at
my
side
startled
me
by
crying
out
in
a
loud
voice
why
it
s
come
back
at
last
how
dare
those
children
tease
him
i
ll
give
the
little
imps
something
to
laugh
at
and
she
flew
right
off
the
wall
down
into
the
road
and
made
straight
for
the
children
squawking
away
in
a
most
terrifying
fashion
and
pecking
at
their
feet
and
legs
the
children
made
off
down
the
street
back
to
the
town
as
hard
as
they
could
run
the
figure
in
the
straw
hat
stood
gazing
after
them
a
moment
and
then
came
wearily
up
to
the
gate
it
didn
t
bother
to
undo
the
latch
but
just
climbed
right
over
the
gate
as
though
it
were
something
in
the
way
and
then
i
noticed
that
it
took
hold
of
the
bars
with
its
feet
so
that
it
really
had
four
hands
to
climb
with
but
it
was
only
when
i
at
last
got
a
glimpse
of
the
face
under
the
hat
that
i
could
be
really
sure
it
was
a
monkey
illustration
a
traveler
arrives
it
was
at
me
suspiciously
from
the
top
of
the
gate
as
though
he
thought
i
was
going
to
laugh
at
him
like
the
other
boys
and
girls
then
he
dropped
into
the
garden
on
the
inside
and
immediately
started
taking
off
his
clothes
he
tore
the
straw
hat
in
two
and
threw
it
down
into
the
road
then
he
took
off
his
bodice
and
skirt
jumped
on
them
savagely
and
began
kicking
them
round
the
front
garden
presently
i
heard
a
screech
from
the
house
and
out
flew
polynesia
followed
by
the
doctor
and
jip
shouted
the
parrot
you
ve
come
at
last
i
always
told
the
doctor
you
d
find
a
way
how
ever
did
you
do
it
they
all
gathered
round
him
shaking
him
by
his
four
hands
laughing
and
asking
him
a
million
questions
at
once
then
they
all
started
back
for
the
house
run
up
to
my
bedroom
stubbins
said
the
doctor
turning
to
me
you
ll
find
a
bag
of
peanuts
in
the
small
drawer
of
the
bureau
i
have
always
kept
them
there
in
case
he
might
come
back
unexpectedly
some
day
and
wait
a
if
has
any
bananas
in
the
pantry
hasn
t
had
a
banana
he
tells
me
in
two
when
i
came
down
again
to
the
kitchen
i
found
everybody
listening
attentively
to
the
monkey
who
was
telling
the
story
of
his
journey
from
africa
fourteenth
s
voyage
it
seems
that
after
polynesia
had
left
had
grown
more
homesick
than
ever
for
the
doctor
and
the
little
house
in
puddleby
at
last
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
by
hook
or
crook
he
would
follow
her
and
one
day
going
down
to
the
seashore
he
saw
a
lot
of
people
black
and
white
getting
on
to
a
ship
that
was
coming
to
england
he
tried
to
get
on
too
but
they
turned
him
back
and
drove
him
away
and
presently
he
noticed
a
whole
big
family
of
funny
people
passing
on
to
the
ship
and
one
of
the
children
in
this
family
reminded
of
a
cousin
of
his
with
whom
he
had
once
been
in
love
so
he
said
to
himself
that
girl
looks
just
as
much
like
a
monkey
as
i
look
like
a
girl
if
i
could
only
get
some
clothes
to
wear
i
might
easily
slip
on
to
the
ship
amongst
these
families
and
people
would
take
me
for
a
girl
good
idea
so
he
went
off
to
a
town
that
was
quite
close
and
hopping
in
through
an
open
window
he
found
a
skirt
and
bodice
lying
on
a
chair
they
belonged
to
a
fashionable
black
lady
who
was
taking
a
bath
put
them
on
next
he
went
back
to
the
seashore
mingled
with
the
crowd
there
and
at
last
sneaked
safely
on
to
the
big
ship
then
he
thought
he
had
better
hide
for
fear
people
might
look
at
him
too
closely
and
he
stayed
hidden
all
the
time
the
ship
was
sailing
to
coming
out
at
night
when
everybody
was
asleep
to
find
food
when
he
reached
england
and
tried
to
get
off
the
ship
the
sailors
saw
at
last
that
he
was
only
a
monkey
dressed
up
in
girl
s
clothes
and
they
wanted
to
keep
him
for
a
pet
but
he
managed
to
give
them
the
slip
and
once
he
was
on
shore
he
dived
into
the
crowd
and
got
away
but
he
was
still
a
long
distance
from
puddleby
and
had
to
come
right
across
the
whole
breadth
of
england
he
had
a
terrible
time
of
it
whenever
he
passed
through
a
town
all
the
children
ran
after
him
in
a
crowd
laughing
and
often
silly
people
caught
hold
of
him
and
tried
to
stop
him
so
that
he
had
to
run
up
and
climb
to
to
escape
from
them
at
night
he
used
to
sleep
in
ditches
or
barns
or
anywhere
he
could
hide
and
he
lived
on
the
berries
he
picked
from
the
hedges
and
the
that
grew
in
the
copses
at
length
after
many
adventures
and
narrow
squeaks
he
saw
the
tower
of
puddleby
church
and
he
knew
that
at
last
he
was
near
his
old
home
when
had
finished
his
story
he
ate
six
bananas
without
stopping
and
drank
a
whole
bowlful
of
milk
my
he
said
why
wasn
t
i
born
with
wings
like
polynesia
so
i
could
fly
here
you
ve
no
idea
how
i
grew
to
hate
that
hat
and
skirt
i
ve
never
been
so
uncomfortable
in
my
life
all
the
way
from
bristol
here
if
the
wretched
hat
wasn
t
falling
off
my
head
or
catching
in
the
trees
those
beastly
skirts
were
tripping
me
up
and
getting
wound
round
everything
what
on
earth
do
women
wear
those
things
for
goodness
i
was
glad
to
see
old
puddleby
this
morning
when
i
climbed
over
the
hill
by
bellaby
s
farm
your
bed
on
top
of
the
in
the
scullery
is
all
ready
for
you
said
the
doctor
we
never
had
it
disturbed
in
case
you
might
come
yes
said
and
you
can
have
the
old
of
the
doctor
s
which
you
used
to
use
as
a
blanket
in
case
it
is
cold
in
the
thanks
said
it
s
good
to
be
back
in
the
old
house
again
everything
s
just
the
same
as
when
i
the
clean
on
the
back
of
the
door
s
i
think
i
ll
go
to
bed
now
i
need
then
we
all
went
out
of
the
kitchen
into
the
scullery
and
watched
climb
the
like
a
sailor
going
up
a
mast
on
the
top
he
curled
himself
up
pulled
the
old
over
him
and
in
a
minute
he
was
snoring
peacefully
good
old
whispered
the
doctor
i
m
glad
he
s
old
echoed
and
polynesia
then
we
all
out
of
the
scullery
and
closed
the
door
very
gently
behind
us
fifteenth
i
become
a
doctor
s
assistant
when
thursday
evening
came
there
was
great
excitement
at
our
house
my
mother
had
asked
me
what
were
the
doctor
s
favorite
dishes
and
i
had
told
her
spare
ribs
sliced
fried
bread
shrimps
and
she
had
them
all
on
the
table
waiting
for
him
and
she
was
now
fussing
round
the
house
to
see
if
everything
was
tidy
and
in
readiness
for
his
coming
at
last
we
heard
a
knock
upon
the
door
and
of
course
it
was
i
who
got
there
first
to
let
him
in
the
doctor
had
brought
his
own
flute
with
him
this
time
and
after
supper
was
over
which
he
enjoyed
very
much
the
table
was
cleared
away
and
the
left
in
the
till
the
next
day
then
the
doctor
and
my
father
started
playing
duets
they
got
so
interested
in
this
that
i
began
to
be
afraid
that
they
would
never
come
to
talking
over
my
business
but
at
last
the
doctor
said
your
son
tells
me
that
he
is
anxious
to
become
a
and
then
began
a
long
talk
which
lasted
far
into
the
night
at
first
both
my
mother
and
father
were
rather
against
the
they
had
been
from
the
beginning
they
said
it
was
only
a
boyish
whim
and
that
i
would
get
tired
of
it
very
soon
but
after
the
matter
had
been
talked
over
from
every
side
the
doctor
turned
to
my
father
and
said
well
now
supposing
stubbins
that
your
son
came
to
me
for
two
is
until
he
is
twelve
years
old
during
those
two
years
he
will
have
time
to
see
if
he
is
going
to
grow
tired
of
it
or
not
also
during
that
time
i
will
promise
to
teach
him
reading
and
writing
and
perhaps
a
little
arithmetic
as
well
what
do
you
say
to
that
i
don
t
know
said
my
father
shaking
his
head
you
are
very
kind
and
it
is
a
handsome
offer
you
make
doctor
but
i
feel
that
tommy
ought
to
be
learning
some
trade
by
which
he
can
earn
his
living
later
then
my
mother
spoke
up
although
she
was
nearly
in
tears
at
the
prospect
of
my
leaving
her
house
while
i
was
still
so
young
she
pointed
out
to
my
father
that
this
was
a
grand
chance
for
me
to
get
learning
now
jacob
she
said
you
know
that
many
lads
in
the
town
have
been
to
the
grammar
school
till
they
were
fourteen
or
fifteen
years
old
tommy
can
easily
spare
these
two
years
for
his
education
and
if
he
learns
no
more
than
to
read
and
write
the
time
will
not
be
lost
though
goodness
knows
she
added
getting
out
her
handkerchief
to
cry
the
house
will
seem
terribly
empty
when
he
s
i
will
take
care
that
he
comes
to
see
you
stubbins
said
the
every
day
if
you
like
after
all
he
will
not
be
very
far
well
at
length
my
father
gave
in
and
it
was
agreed
that
i
was
to
live
with
the
doctor
and
work
for
him
for
two
years
in
exchange
for
learning
to
read
and
write
and
for
my
board
and
lodging
of
course
added
the
doctor
while
i
have
money
i
will
keep
tommy
in
clothes
as
well
but
money
is
a
very
irregular
thing
with
me
sometimes
i
have
some
and
then
sometimes
i
haven
you
are
very
good
doctor
said
my
mother
drying
her
tears
it
seems
to
me
that
tommy
is
a
very
fortunate
and
then
thoughtless
selfish
little
imp
that
i
was
i
leaned
over
and
whispered
in
the
doctor
s
ear
please
don
t
forget
to
say
something
about
the
oh
by
the
way
said
john
dolittle
of
course
occasionally
my
work
requires
me
to
travel
you
will
have
no
objection
i
take
it
to
your
son
s
coming
with
me
my
poor
mother
looked
up
sharply
more
unhappy
and
anxious
than
ever
at
this
new
turn
while
i
stood
behind
the
doctor
s
chair
my
heart
thumping
with
excitement
waiting
for
my
father
s
answer
no
he
said
slowly
after
a
while
if
we
agree
to
the
other
arrangement
i
don
t
see
that
we
ve
the
right
to
make
any
objection
to
well
there
surely
was
never
a
happier
boy
in
the
world
than
i
was
at
that
moment
my
head
was
in
the
clouds
i
trod
on
air
i
could
scarcely
keep
from
dancing
round
the
parlor
at
last
the
dream
of
my
life
was
to
come
true
at
last
i
was
to
be
given
a
chance
to
seek
my
fortune
to
have
adventures
for
i
knew
perfectly
well
that
it
was
now
almost
time
for
the
doctor
to
start
upon
another
voyage
polynesia
had
told
me
that
he
hardly
ever
stayed
at
home
for
more
than
six
months
at
a
stretch
therefore
he
would
be
surely
going
again
within
a
fortnight
and
tommy
stubbins
would
go
with
him
just
to
think
of
it
cross
the
sea
to
walk
on
foreign
shores
to
roam
the
world
illustration
part
two
first
the
crew
of
the
curlew
from
that
time
on
of
course
my
position
in
the
town
was
very
different
i
was
no
longer
a
poor
cobbler
s
son
i
carried
my
nose
in
the
air
as
i
went
down
the
high
street
with
jip
in
his
gold
collar
at
my
side
and
snobbish
little
boys
who
had
despised
me
before
because
i
was
not
rich
enough
to
go
to
school
now
pointed
me
out
to
their
friends
and
whispered
you
see
him
he
s
a
doctor
s
only
ten
years
old
but
their
eyes
would
have
opened
still
wider
with
wonder
if
they
had
but
known
that
i
and
the
dog
that
was
with
me
could
talk
to
one
another
two
days
after
the
doctor
had
been
to
our
house
to
dinner
he
told
me
very
sadly
that
he
was
afraid
that
he
would
have
to
give
up
trying
to
learn
the
language
of
the
all
events
for
the
present
i
m
very
discouraged
stubbins
very
i
ve
tried
the
mussels
and
the
clams
the
oysters
and
the
whelks
cockles
and
scallops
seven
different
kinds
of
crabs
and
all
the
lobster
family
i
think
i
ll
leave
it
for
the
present
and
go
at
it
again
later
what
will
you
turn
to
now
i
asked
well
i
rather
thought
of
going
on
a
voyage
stubbins
it
s
quite
a
time
now
since
i
ve
been
away
and
there
is
a
great
deal
of
work
waiting
for
me
when
shall
we
start
i
asked
well
first
i
shall
have
to
wait
till
the
purple
gets
here
i
must
see
if
she
has
any
message
for
me
from
long
arrow
she
s
late
she
should
have
been
here
ten
days
ago
i
hope
to
goodness
she
s
all
well
hadn
t
we
better
be
seeing
about
getting
a
boat
i
said
she
is
sure
to
be
here
in
a
day
or
so
and
there
will
be
lots
of
things
to
do
to
get
ready
in
the
mean
time
won
t
there
yes
indeed
said
the
doctor
suppose
we
go
down
and
see
your
friend
joe
the
he
will
know
about
i
d
like
to
come
too
said
jip
all
right
come
along
said
the
doctor
and
off
we
went
joe
said
yes
he
had
a
he
had
just
it
needed
three
people
to
sail
her
we
told
him
we
would
like
to
see
it
anyway
so
the
took
us
off
a
little
way
down
the
river
and
showed
us
the
neatest
prettiest
little
vessel
that
ever
was
built
she
was
called
joe
said
he
would
sell
her
to
us
cheap
but
the
trouble
was
that
the
boat
needed
three
people
while
we
were
only
two
of
course
i
shall
be
taking
said
the
doctor
but
although
he
is
very
quick
and
clever
he
is
not
as
strong
as
a
man
we
really
ought
to
have
another
person
to
sail
a
boat
as
big
as
i
know
of
a
good
sailor
doctor
said
a
seaman
who
would
be
glad
of
the
no
thank
you
joe
said
doctor
dolittle
i
don
t
want
any
seamen
i
couldn
t
afford
to
hire
them
and
then
they
hamper
me
so
seamen
do
when
i
m
at
sea
they
re
always
wanting
to
do
things
the
proper
way
and
i
like
to
do
them
let
me
see
who
could
we
take
with
us
there
s
matthew
mugg
the
cat
i
said
no
he
wouldn
t
do
matthew
s
a
very
nice
fellow
but
he
talks
too
about
his
rheumatism
you
have
to
be
frightfully
particular
whom
you
take
with
you
on
long
how
about
luke
the
hermit
i
asked
that
s
a
good
he
ll
come
let
s
go
and
ask
him
right
second
luke
the
hermit
the
hermit
was
an
old
friend
of
ours
as
i
have
already
told
you
he
was
a
very
peculiar
person
far
out
on
the
marshes
he
lived
in
a
little
bit
of
a
alone
except
for
his
brindle
bulldog
no
one
knew
where
he
came
even
his
name
just
luke
the
hermit
folks
called
him
he
never
came
into
the
town
never
seemed
to
want
to
see
or
talk
to
people
his
dog
bob
drove
them
away
if
they
came
near
his
hut
when
you
asked
anyone
in
puddleby
who
he
was
or
why
he
lived
out
in
that
lonely
place
by
himself
the
only
answer
you
got
was
oh
luke
the
hermit
well
there
s
some
mystery
about
him
nobody
knows
what
it
is
but
there
s
a
mystery
don
t
go
near
him
he
ll
set
the
dog
on
nevertheless
there
were
two
people
who
often
went
out
to
that
little
shack
on
the
fens
the
doctor
and
myself
and
bob
the
bulldog
never
barked
when
he
heard
us
coming
for
we
liked
luke
and
luke
liked
us
this
afternoon
crossing
the
marshes
we
faced
a
cold
wind
blowing
from
the
east
as
we
approached
the
hut
jip
put
up
his
ears
and
said
that
s
funny
what
s
funny
asked
the
doctor
that
bob
hasn
t
come
out
to
meet
us
he
should
have
heard
us
long
smelt
us
what
s
that
queer
noise
sounds
to
me
like
a
gate
creaking
said
the
doctor
maybe
it
s
luke
s
door
only
we
can
t
see
the
door
from
here
it
s
on
the
far
side
of
the
i
hope
bob
isn
t
sick
said
jip
and
he
let
out
a
bark
to
see
if
that
would
call
him
but
the
only
answer
he
got
was
the
wailing
of
the
wind
across
the
wide
salt
fen
we
hurried
forward
all
three
of
us
thinking
hard
when
we
reached
the
front
of
the
shack
we
found
the
door
open
swinging
and
creaking
dismally
in
the
wind
we
looked
inside
there
was
no
one
there
isn
t
luke
at
home
then
said
i
perhaps
he
s
out
for
a
he
is
at
home
said
the
doctor
frowning
in
a
peculiar
sort
of
way
and
even
if
he
were
out
for
a
walk
he
wouldn
t
leave
his
door
banging
in
the
wind
behind
him
there
is
something
queer
about
are
you
doing
in
there
jip
nothing
worth
speaking
of
said
jip
examining
the
floor
of
the
hut
extremely
carefully
come
here
jip
said
the
doctor
in
a
stern
voice
you
are
hiding
something
from
me
you
see
signs
and
you
know
you
guess
it
what
has
happened
tell
me
where
is
the
hermit
i
don
t
know
said
jip
looking
very
guilty
and
uncomfortable
i
don
t
know
where
he
well
you
know
something
i
can
tell
it
from
the
look
in
your
eye
what
is
it
but
jip
didn
t
answer
for
ten
minutes
the
doctor
kept
questioning
him
but
not
a
word
would
the
dog
say
well
said
the
doctor
at
last
it
is
no
use
our
standing
around
here
in
the
cold
the
hermit
s
gone
that
s
all
we
might
as
well
go
home
to
as
we
buttoned
up
our
coats
and
started
back
across
the
marsh
jip
ran
ahead
pretending
he
was
looking
for
he
knows
something
all
right
whispered
the
doctor
and
i
think
he
knows
what
has
happened
too
it
s
funny
his
not
wanting
to
tell
me
he
has
never
done
that
in
eleven
years
he
has
always
told
me
strange
do
you
mean
you
think
he
knows
all
about
the
hermit
the
big
mystery
about
him
which
folks
hint
at
and
all
that
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
he
did
the
doctor
answered
slowly
i
noticed
something
in
his
expression
the
moment
we
found
that
door
open
and
the
hut
empty
and
the
way
he
sniffed
the
floor
told
him
something
that
floor
did
he
saw
signs
we
couldn
t
wonder
why
he
won
t
tell
me
i
ll
try
him
again
here
jip
jip
is
the
dog
i
thought
he
went
on
in
so
did
i
i
said
he
was
there
a
moment
ago
i
saw
him
as
large
as
life
but
he
was
gone
we
called
and
called
we
even
walked
back
to
the
hut
but
jip
had
disappeared
oh
well
i
said
most
likely
he
has
just
run
home
ahead
of
us
he
often
does
that
you
know
we
ll
find
him
there
when
we
get
back
to
the
but
the
doctor
just
closed
his
tighter
against
the
wind
and
strode
on
muttering
odd
third
jip
and
the
secret
when
we
reached
the
house
the
first
question
the
doctor
asked
of
in
the
hall
was
is
jip
home
yet
no
said
i
haven
t
seen
let
me
know
the
moment
he
comes
in
will
you
please
said
the
doctor
hanging
up
his
hat
certainly
i
will
said
don
t
be
long
over
washing
your
hands
the
lunch
is
on
the
just
as
we

but
i

doctor
because

dog
that

and
i
swore
to

me
now

said
jip
we

i
followed
bob
s
scent
just
now
when
i
left

out
there
on
the
marshes
and
i
found
him
and
i
said

i
said
for

bob

to

he
it
s
all

oh
for
heaven
s
sake

go
on
cried
the
doctor
tell
us
what
the
mystery
what
you
said
to
bob
and
what
bob
said
to
you
what
has
happened
where
the
hermit
he
s
in
puddleby
jail
said
jip
he
s
in
in
prison
what
for
s
he
done
jip
went
over
to
the
door
and
smelt
at
the
bottom
of
it
to
see
if
any
one
were
listening
outside
then
he
came
back
to
the
doctor
on
tiptoe
and
whispered
killed
a
man
lord
preserve
us
cried
the
doctor
sitting
down
heavily
in
a
chair
and
mopping
his
forehead
with
a
handkerchief
when
did
he
do
it
fifteen
years
a
mexican
that
s
why
he
has
been
a
hermit
ever
since
he
shaved
off
his
beard
and
kept
away
from
people
out
there
on
the
marshes
so
he
wouldn
t
be
recognized
but
last
week
it
seems
these
policemen
came
to
town
and
they
heard
there
was
a
strange
man
who
kept
to
himself
all
alone
in
a
shack
on
the
fen
and
they
got
suspicious
for
a
long
time
people
had
been
hunting
all
over
the
world
for
the
man
that
did
that
killing
in
the
mexican
fifteen
years
ago
so
these
policemen
went
out
to
the
shack
and
they
recognized
luke
by
a
mole
on
his
arm
and
they
took
him
to
well
well
murmured
the
doctor
who
would
have
thought
it
the
philosopher
a
man
can
hardly
believe
it
s
true
said
jip
luke
did
it
but
it
wasn
t
his
fault
bob
says
so
and
he
was
there
and
saw
it
all
he
was
scarcely
more
than
a
puppy
at
the
time
bob
says
luke
couldn
t
help
it
he
to
do
where
is
bob
now
asked
the
doctor
down
at
the
prison
i
wanted
him
to
come
with
me
here
to
see
you
but
he
won
t
leave
the
prison
while
luke
is
there
he
just
sits
outside
the
door
of
the
and
won
t
move
he
doesn
t
even
eat
the
food
they
give
him
won
t
you
please
come
down
there
doctor
and
see
if
there
is
anything
you
can
do
the
trial
is
to
be
this
afternoon
at
two
o
clock
what
time
is
it
now
it
s
ten
minutes
past
bob
says
he
thinks
they
are
going
to
kill
luke
for
a
punishment
if
they
can
prove
that
he
did
certainly
keep
him
in
prison
for
the
rest
of
his
life
won
t
you
please
come
perhaps
if
you
spoke
to
the
judge
and
told
him
what
a
good
man
luke
really
is
they
d
let
him
of
course
i
ll
come
said
the
doctor
getting
up
and
moving
to
go
but
i
m
very
much
afraid
that
i
shan
t
be
of
any
real
he
turned
at
the
door
and
hesitated
thoughtfully
and
then
he
opened
the
door
and
passed
out
with
jip
and
me
close
at
his
heels
fourth
bob
was
terribly
upset
when
she
found
we
were
going
away
again
without
luncheon
and
she
made
us
take
some
cold
in
our
pockets
to
eat
on
the
way
when
we
got
to
puddleby
it
was
next
door
to
the
prison
we
found
a
great
crowd
gathered
around
the
building
this
was
the
week
of
the
business
which
happened
every
three
months
when
many
and
other
bad
characters
were
tried
by
a
very
grand
judge
who
came
all
the
way
from
london
and
anybody
in
puddleby
who
had
nothing
special
to
do
used
to
come
to
the
to
hear
the
trials
but
it
was
different
the
crowd
was
not
made
up
of
just
a
few
idle
people
it
was
enormous
the
news
had
run
through
the
countryside
that
luke
the
hermit
was
to
be
tried
for
killing
a
man
and
that
the
great
mystery
which
had
hung
over
him
so
long
was
to
be
cleared
up
at
last
the
butcher
and
the
baker
had
closed
their
shops
and
taken
a
holiday
all
the
farmers
from
and
all
the
townsfolk
were
there
with
their
sunday
clothes
on
trying
to
get
seats
in
the
or
gossipping
outside
in
low
whispers
the
high
street
was
so
crowded
you
could
hardly
move
along
it
i
had
never
seen
the
quiet
old
town
in
such
a
state
of
excitement
before
for
puddleby
had
not
had
such
an
assizes
since
when
ferdinand
phipps
the
rector
s
oldest
son
had
robbed
the
bank
if
i
hadn
t
had
the
doctor
with
me
i
am
sure
i
would
never
have
been
able
to
make
my
way
through
the
mob
packed
around
the
door
but
i
just
followed
behind
him
hanging
on
to
his
and
at
last
we
got
safely
into
the
jail
i
want
to
see
luke
said
the
doctor
to
a
very
grand
person
in
a
blue
coat
with
brass
buttons
standing
at
the
door
ask
at
the
superintendent
s
office
said
the
man
third
door
on
the
left
down
the
who
is
that
person
you
spoke
to
doctor
i
asked
as
we
went
along
the
passage
he
is
a
and
what
are
policemen
policemen
they
are
to
keep
people
in
order
they
ve
just
been
sir
robert
peel
that
s
why
they
are
also
called
peelers
sometimes
it
is
a
wonderful
age
we
live
in
they
re
always
thinking
of
something
will
be
the
superintendent
s
office
i
illustration
on
the
bed
sat
the
hermit
from
there
another
policeman
was
sent
with
us
to
show
us
the
way
outside
the
door
of
luke
s
cell
we
found
bob
the
bulldog
who
wagged
his
tail
sadly
when
he
saw
us
the
man
who
was
guiding
us
took
a
large
bunch
of
keys
from
his
pocket
and
opened
the
door
i
had
never
been
inside
a
real
before
and
i
felt
quite
a
thrill
when
the
policeman
went
out
and
locked
the
door
after
him
leaving
us
shut
in
the
little
stone
room
before
he
went
he
said
that
as
soon
as
we
had
done
talking
with
our
friend
we
should
knock
upon
the
door
and
he
would
come
and
let
us
out
at
first
i
could
hardly
see
anything
it
was
so
dim
inside
but
after
a
little
i
made
out
a
low
bed
against
the
wall
under
a
small
barred
window
on
the
bed
staring
down
at
the
floor
between
his
feet
sat
the
hermit
his
head
resting
in
his
hands
well
luke
said
the
doctor
in
a
kindly
voice
they
don
t
give
you
much
light
in
here
do
they
very
slowly
the
hermit
looked
up
from
the
floor
hulloa
john
dolittle
what
brings
you
here
i
ve
come
to
see
you
i
would
have
been

sooner
only
i
didn
t

till
a
few
minutes
ago
i
went
to
your
hut
to
ask
you
if
you
would
join
me
on
a
voyage
and
when
i
found
it
empty
i
had
no
idea
where
you
could
be
i
am
dreadfully
sorry
to
hear
about
your
bad
luck
i
ve
come
to
see
if
there
is
anything
i
can
luke
shook
his
head
no
i
don
t
imagine
there
is
anything
can
be
done
they
ve
caught
me
at
last
that
s
the
end
of
it
i
he
got
up
stiffly
and
started
walking
up
and
down
the
little
room
in
a
way
i
m
glad
it
s
over
said
he
i
never
got
any
peace
always
thinking
they
were
after
to
speak
to
anyone
they
were
bound
to
get
me
in
the
i
m
glad
it
s
then
the
doctor
talked
to
luke
for
more
than
half
an
hour
trying
to
cheer
him
up
while
i
sat
around
wondering
what
i
ought
to
say
and
wishing
i
could
do
something
at
last
the
doctor
said
he
wanted
to
see
bob
and
we
knocked
upon
the
door
and
were
let
out
by
the
policeman

fifth
mendoza
inside
the
everything
was
very
solemn
and
wonderful
it
was
a
high
big
room
raised
above
the
floor
against
the
wall
was
the
judge
s
desk
and
here
the
judge
was
already
old
handsome
man
in
a
marvelous
big
wig
of
gray
hair
and
a
gown
of
black
below
him
was
another
wide
long
desk
at
which
lawyers
in
white
wigs
sat
the
whole
thing
reminded
me
of
a
mixture
between
a
church
and
a
school
those
twelve
men
at
the
side
whispered
the
those
in
pews
like
a
choir
they
are
what
is
called
the
jury
it
is
they
who
decide
whether
luke
is
he
did
it
or
and
look
i
said
there
s
luke
himself
in
a
sort
of
with
policemen
each
side
of
him
and
there
s
another
pulpit
the
same
kind
the
other
side
of
the
room
that
one
s
that
one
is
called
the
said
the
doctor
now
i
m
going
down
to
speak
to
one
of
those
men
in
white
wigs
and
i
want
you
to
wait
here
and
keep
these
two
seats
for
us
bob
will
stay
with
you
keep
an
eye
on
hold
on
to
his
collar
i
shan
t
be
more
than
a
minute
or
with
that
the
doctor
disappeared
into
the
crowd
which
filled
the
main
part
of
the
room
then
i
saw
the
judge
take
up
a
funny
little
wooden
hammer
and
knock
on
his
desk
with
it
this
it
seemed
was
to
make
people
keep
quiet
for
immediately
every
one
stopped
buzzing
and
talking
and
began
to
listen
very
respectfully
then
another
man
in
a
black
gown
stood
up
and
began
reading
from
a
paper
in
his
hand
he
mumbled
away
exactly
as
though
he
were
saying
his
prayers
and
didn
t
want
any
one
to
understand
what
language
they
were
in
but
i
managed
to
catch
a
few
words
known
as
luke
the
hermit
killing
his
partner
known
as
bluebeard
bill
on
the
night
of
the
mexico
therefore
her
majesty
at
this
moment
i
felt
some
one
take
hold
of
my
arm
from
the
back
and
turning
round
i
found
the
doctor
had
returned
with
one
of
the
men
in
white
wigs
stubbins
this
is
percy
jenkyns
said
the
doctor
he
is
luke
s
lawyer
it
is
his
business
to
get
luke
he
jenkyns
seemed
to
be
an
extremely
young
man
with
a
round
smooth
face
like
a
boy
he
shook
hands
with
me
and
then
immediately
turned
and
went
on
talking
with
the
doctor
oh
i
think
it
is
a
perfectly
precious
idea
he
was
saying
of
the
dog
must
be
admitted
as
a
witness
he
was
the
only
one
who
saw
the
thing
take
place
i
m
awfully
glad
you
came
i
wouldn
t
have
missed
this
for
anything
my
hat
won
t
it
make
the
old
court
sit
up
they
re
always
frightfully
dull
these
assizes
but
this
will
stir
things
a
bulldog
witness
for
the
defense
i
do
hope
there
are
plenty
of
reporters
there
s
one
making
a
sketch
of
the
prisoner
i
shall
become
known
after
won
t
conkey
be
pleased
my
hat
he
put
his
hand
over
his
mouth
to
smother
a
laugh
and
his
eyes
fairly
sparkled
with
mischief
who
is
conkey
i
asked
the
doctor
sh
he
is
speaking
of
the
judge
up
there
the
honorable
eustace
beauchamp
now
said
jenkyns
bringing
out
a
tell
me
a
little
more
about
yourself
doctor
you
took
your
degree
as
doctor
of
medicine
at
durham
i
think
you
said
and
the
name
of
your
last
book
was
i
could
not
hear
any
more
for
they
talked
in
whispers
and
i
fell
to
looking
round
the
court
again
of
course
i
could
not
understand
everything
that
was
going
on
though
it
was
all
very
interesting
people
kept
getting
up
in
the
place
the
doctor
called
the
and
the
lawyers
at
the
long
table
asked
them
questions
about
the
night
of
the
then
the
people
would
get
down
again
and
somebody
else
would
get
up
and
be
questioned
one
of
the
lawyers
who
the
doctor
told
me
afterwards
was
called
the
prosecutor
seemed
to
be
doing
his
best
to
get
the
hermit
into
trouble
by
asking
questions
which
made
it
look
as
though
he
had
always
been
a
very
bad
man
he
was
a
nasty
lawyer
this
prosecutor
with
a
long
nose
most
of
the
time
i
could
hardly
keep
my
eyes
off
poor
luke
who
sat
there
between
his
two
policemen
staring
at
the
floor
as
though
he
weren
t
interested
the
only
time
i
saw
him
take
any
notice
at
all
was
when
a
small
dark
man
with
wicked
little
watery
eyes
got
up
into
the
i
heard
bob
snarl
under
my
chair
as
this
person
came
into
the
and
luke
s
eyes
just
blazed
with
anger
and
contempt
this
man
said
his
name
was
mendoza
and
that
he
was
the
one
who
had
guided
the
mexican
police
to
the
mine
after
bluebeard
bill
had
been
killed
and
at
every
word
he
said
i
could
hear
bob
down
below
me
muttering
between
his
teeth
it
s
a
lie
it
s
a
lie
i
ll
chew
his
face
it
s
a
lie
and
both
the
doctor
and
i
had
hard
work
keeping
the
dog
under
the
seat
then
i
noticed
that
our
jenkyns
had
disappeared
from
the
doctor
s
side
but
presently
i
saw
him
stand
up
at
the
long
table
to
speak
to
the
judge
your
honor
said
he
i
wish
to
introduce
a
new
witness
for
the
defense
doctor
john
dolittle
the
naturalist
will
you
please
step
into
the
doctor
there
was
a
buzz
of
excitement
as
the
doctor
made
his
way
across
the
crowded
room
and
i
noticed
the
nasty
lawyer
with
the
long
nose
lean
down
and
whisper
something
to
a
friend
smiling
in
an
ugly
way
which
made
me
want
to
pinch
him
then
jenkyns
asked
the
doctor
a
whole
lot
of
questions
about
himself
and
made
him
answer
in
a
loud
voice
so
the
whole
court
could
hear
he
finished
up
by
saying
and
you
are
prepared
to
swear
doctor
dolittle
that
you
understand
the
language
of
dogs
and
can
make
them
understand
you
is
that
so
yes
said
the
doctor
that
is
and
what
might
i
ask
put
in
the
judge
in
a
very
quiet
dignified
voice
has
all
this
to
do
with
the
killing
of
bill
this
your
honor
said
jenkyns
talking
in
a
very
grand
manner
as
though
he
were
on
a
stage
in
a
theatre
there
is
in
this
at
the
present
moment
a
bulldog
who
was
the
only
living
thing
that
saw
the
man
killed
with
the
court
s
permission
i
propose
to
put
that
dog
in
the
and
have
him
questioned
before
you
by
the
eminent
scientist
doctor
john
sixth
the
judge
s
dog
at
first
there
was
a
dead
silence
in
the
court
then
everybody
began
whispering
or
giggling
at
the
same
time
till
the
whole
room
sounded
like
a
great
hive
of
bees
many
people
seemed
to
be
shocked
most
of
them
were
amused
and
a
few
were
angry
presently
up
sprang
the
nasty
lawyer
with
the
long
nose
i
protest
your
honor
he
cried
waving
his
arms
wildly
to
the
judge
i
object
the
dignity
of
this
court
is
in
peril
i
i
am
the
one
to
take
care
of
the
dignity
of
this
court
said
the
judge
then
jenkyns
got
up
again
if
it
hadn
t
been
such
a
serious
matter
it
was
almost
like
a
show
somebody
was
always
popping
down
and
somebody
else
popping
up
if
there
is
any
doubt
on
the
score
of
our
being
able
to
do
as
we
say
your
honor
will
have
no
objection
i
trust
to
the
doctor
s
giving
the
court
a
demonstration
of
his
showing
that
he
actually
can
understand
the
speech
of
animals
i
thought
i
saw
a
twinkle
of
amusement
come
into
the
old
judge
s
eyes
as
he
sat
considering
a
moment
before
he
answered
no
he
said
at
last
i
don
t
think
then
he
turned
to
the
doctor
are
you
quite
sure
you
can
do
this
he
asked
quite
your
honor
said
the
quite
very
well
then
said
the
judge
if
you
can
satisfy
us
that
you
really
are
able
to
understand
canine
testimony
the
dog
shall
be
admitted
as
a
witness
i
do
not
see
in
that
case
how
i
could
object
to
his
being
heard
but
i
warn
you
that
if
you
are
trying
to
make
a
of
this
court
it
will
go
hard
with
i
protest
i
protest
yelled
the
prosecutor
this
is
a
scandal
an
outrage
to
the
bar
sit
down
said
the
judge
in
a
very
stern
voice
what
animal
does
your
honor
wish
me
to
talk
with
asked
the
doctor
i
would
like
you
to
talk
to
my
own
dog
said
the
judge
he
is
outside
in
the
i
will
have
him
brought
in
and
then
we
shall
see
what
you
can
then
someone
went
out
and
fetched
the
judge
s
dog
a
lovely
great
russian
with
slender
legs
and
a
shaggy
coat
he
was
a
proud
and
beautiful
creature
now
doctor
said
the
judge
did
you
ever
see
this
dog
before
you
are
in
the
and
under
no
your
honor
i
never
saw
him
very
well
then
will
you
please
ask
him
to
tell
you
what
i
had
for
supper
last
night
he
was
with
me
and
watched
me
while
i
then
the
doctor
and
the
dog
started
talking
to
one
another
in
signs
and
sounds
and
they
kept
at
it
for
quite
a
long
time
and
the
doctor
began
to
giggle
and
get
so
interested
that
he
seemed
to
forget
all
about
the
court
and
the
judge
and
everything
else
what
a
time
he
takes
i
heard
a
fat
woman
in
front
of
me
whispering
he
s
only
pretending
of
course
he
can
t
do
it
who
ever
heard
of
talking
to
a
dog
he
must
think
we
re
haven
t
you
finished
yet
the
judge
asked
the
doctor
it
shouldn
t
take
that
long
just
to
ask
what
i
had
for
oh
no
your
honor
said
the
doctor
the
dog
told
me
that
long
ago
but
then
he
went
on
to
tell
me
what
you
did
after
never
mind
that
said
the
judge
tell
me
what
answer
he
gave
you
to

says

a
two
baked
potatoes
a
pickled
walnut
and
a
glass
of
the
honorable
eustace
beauchamp
conckley

white
to
the
lips
sounds
like
witchcraft
he
muttered
i
never
and
after
your
supper
the
doctor
went
on
he
says
you
went
to
see
a
and
then
sat
up
playing
cards
for
money
till
twelve
o
clock
and
came
home
singing
we
won
t
that
will
do
the
judge
interrupted
i
am
satisfied
you
can
do
as
you
say
the
prisoner
s
dog
shall
be
admitted
as
a
i
protest
i
object
screamed
the
prosecutor
your

down
roared
the
judge
i

the
dog
shall
be

that
ends
the
matter
put
the
witness
in
the
and
then
for
the
first
time
in
the
solemn
history
of
england
a
dog
was
put
in
the
of
her
majesty
s
court
of
assizes
and
it
was
i
tommy
stubbins
when
the
doctor
made
a
sign
to
me
across
the
room
who
proudly
led
bob
up
the
aisle
through
the
astonished
crowd
past
the
frowning
spluttering
prosecutor
and
made
him
comfortable
on
a
high
chair
in
the
from
where
the
old
bulldog
sat
scowling
down
over
the
rail
upon
the
amazed
and
gaping
jury
illustration
sat
scowling
down
upon
the
amazed
and
gaping
jury
seventh
the
end
of
the
mystery
the
trial
went
swiftly
forward
after
that
jenkyns
told
the
doctor
to
ask
bob
what
he
saw
on
the
night
of
the
and
when
bob
had
told
all
he
knew
and
the
doctor
had
turned
it
into
english
for
the
judge
and
the
jury
this
was
what
he
had
to
say
on
the
night
of
the
of
november
i
was
with
my
master
luke
fitzjohn
otherwise
known
as
luke
the
hermit
and
his
two
partners
manuel
mendoza
and
william
boggs
otherwise
known
as
bluebeard
bill
on
their
in
mexico
for
a
long
time
these
three
men
had
been
hunting
for
gold
and
they
had
dug
a
deep
hole
in
the
ground
on
the
morning
of
the
gold
was
discovered
lots
of
it
at
the
bottom
of
this
hole
and
all
three
my
master
and
his
two
partners
were
very
happy
about
it
because
now
they
would
be
rich
but
manuel
mendoza
asked
bluebeard
bill
to
go
for
a
walk
with
him
these
two
men
i
had
always
suspected
of
being
bad
so
when
i
noticed
that
they
left
my
master
behind
i
followed
them
secretly
to
see
what
they
were
up
to
and
in
a
deep
cave
in
the
mountains
i
heard
them
arrange
together
to
kill
luke
the
hermit
so
that
they
should
get
all
the
gold
and
he
have
at
this
point
the
judge
asked
where
is
the
witness
mendoza
constable
see
that
he
does
not
leave
the
but
the
wicked
little
man
with
the
watery
eyes
had
already
sneaked
out
when
no
one
was
looking
and
he
was
never
seen
in
puddleby
again
then
bob
s
statement
went
on
i
went
to
my
master
and
tried
very
hard
to
make
him
understand
that
his
partners
were
dangerous
men
but
it
was
no
use
he
did
not
understand
dog
language
so
i
did
the
next
best
thing
i
never
let
him
out
of
my
sight
but
stayed
with
him
every
moment
of
the
day
and
night
now
the
hole
that
they
had
made
was
so
deep
that
to
get
down
and
up
it
you
had
to
go
in
a
big
bucket
tied
on
the
end
of
a
rope
and
the
three
men
used
to
haul
one
another
up
and
let
one
another
down
the
mine
in
this
way
that
was
how
the
gold
was
brought
up
the
bucket
well
about
seven
o
clock
in
the
evening
my
master
was
standing
at
the
top
of
the
mine
hauling
up
bluebeard
bill
who
was
in
the
bucket
just
as
he
had
got
bill
halfway
up
i
saw
mendoza
come
out
of
the
hut
where
we
all
lived
mendoza
thought
that
bill
was
away
buying
groceries
but
he
wasn
t
he
was
in
the
bucket
and
when
mendoza
saw
luke
hauling
and
straining
on
the
rope
he
thought
he
was
pulling
up
a
bucketful
of
gold
so
he
drew
a
pistol
from
his
pocket
and
came
sneaking
up
behind
luke
to
shoot
him
i
barked
and
barked
to
warn
my
master
of
the
danger
he
was
in
but
he
was
so
busy
hauling
up
bill
who
was
a
heavy
fat
man
that
he
took
no
notice
of
me
i
saw
that
if
i
didn
t
do
something
quick
he
would
surely
be
shot
so
i
did
a
thing
i
ve
never
done
before
suddenly
and
savagely
i
bit
my
master
in
the
leg
from
behind
luke
was
so
hurt
and
startled
that
he
did
just
what
i
wanted
him
to
do
he
let
go
the
rope
with
both
hands
at
once
and
turned
round
and
then
down
went
bill
in
his
bucket
to
the
bottom
of
the
mine
and
he
was
killed
while
my
master
was
busy
scolding
me
mendoza
put
his
pistol
in
his
pocket
came
up
with
a
smile
on
his
face
and
looked
down
the
mine
why
good
gracious
said
he
to
luke
you
ve
killed
bluebeard
bill
i
must
go
and
tell
the
police
you
see
to
get
the
whole
mine
to
himself
when
luke
should
be
put
in
prison
then
he
jumped
on
his
horse
and
galloped
away
and
soon
my
master
grew
afraid
for
he
saw
that
if
mendoza
only
told
enough
lies
to
the
police
it
look
as
though
he
had
killed
bill
on
purpose
so
while
mendoza
was
gone
he
and
i
stole
away
together
secretly
and
came
to
england
here
he
shaved
off
his
beard
and
became
a
hermit
and
ever
since
for
fifteen
years
we
ve
remained
in
hiding
this
is
all
i
have
to
say
and
i
swear
it
is
the
truth
every
when
the
doctor
finished
reading
bob
s
long
speech
the
excitement
among
the
twelve
men
of
the
jury
was
positively
terrific
one
a
very
old
man
with
white
hair
began
to
weep
in
a
loud
voice
at
the
thought
of
poor
luke
hiding
on
the
fen
for
fifteen
years
for
something
he
couldn
t
help
and
all
the
others
set
to
whispering
and
nodding
their
heads
to
one
another
in
the
middle
of
all
this
up
got
that
horrible
prosecutor
again
waving
his
arms
more
wildly
than
ever
your
honor
he
cried
i
must
object
to
this
evidence
as
biased
of
course
the
dog
would
not
tell
the
truth
against
his
own
master
i
object
i
very
well
said
the
judge
you
are
at
liberty
to
it
is
your
duty
as
prosecutor
to
prove
his
evidence
untrue
there
is
the
dog
question
him
if
you
do
not
believe
what
he
i
thought
the
lawyer
would
have
a
fit
he
looked
first
at
the
dog
then
at
the
doctor
then
at
the
judge
then
back
at
the
dog
scowling
from
the
he
opened
his
mouth
to
say
something
but
no
words
came
he
waved
his
arms
some
more
his
face
got
redder
and
redder
at
last
clutching
his
forehead
he
sank
weakly
into
his
seat
and
had
to
be
helped
out
of
the
by
two
friends
as
he
was
half
carried
through
the
door
he
was
still
feebly
murmuring
i
protest
eighth
three
cheers
next
the
judge
made
a
very
long
speech
to
the
jury
and
when
it
was
over
all
the
twelve
jurymen
got
up
and
went
out
into
the
next
room
and
at
that
point
the
doctor
came
back
leading
bob
to
the
seat
beside
me
what
have
the
jurymen
gone
out
for
i
asked
they
always
do
that
at
the
end
of
a
make
up
their
minds
whether
the
prisoner
did
it
or
couldn
t
you
and
bob
go
in
with
them
and
help
them
make
up
their
minds
the
right
way
i
asked
no
that
s
not
allowed
they
have
to
talk
it
over
in
secret
sometimes
it
gracious
look
they
re
coming
back
already
they
didn
t
spend
long
over
everybody
kept
quite
still
while
the
twelve
men
came
tramping
back
into
their
places
in
the
pews
then
one
of
them
the
little
up
and
turned
to
the
judge
every
one
was
holding
his
breath
especially
the
doctor
and
myself
to
see
what
he
was
going
to
say
you
could
have
heard
a
pin
drop
while
the
whole
the
whole
of
puddleby
in
fact
waited
with
craning
necks
and
straining
ears
to
hear
the
weighty
words
your
honor
said
the
little
man
the
jury
returns
a
verdict
of
what
s
that
mean
i
asked
turning
to
the
doctor
but
i
found
doctor
john
dolittle
the
famous
naturalist
standing
on
top
of
a
chair
dancing
about
on
one
leg
like
a
schoolboy
it
means
he
s
free
he
cried
luke

free
then
he
ll
be
able
to
come
on
the
voyage

won
t
he
but
i
could
not
hear
his
answer
for
the
whole
seemed
to
be
jumping
up
on
chairs
like
the
doctor
the
crowd
had
suddenly
gone
crazy
all
the
people
were
laughing
and
calling
and
waving
to
luke
to
show
him
how
glad
they
were
that
he
was
free
the
noise
was
deafening
then
it
stopped
all
was
quiet
again
and
the
people
stood
up
respectfully
while
the
judge
left
the
court
for
the
trial
of
luke
the
hermit
that
famous
trial
which
to
this
day
they
are
still
talking
of
in
puddleby
was
over
in
the
hush
while
the
judge
was
leaving
a
sudden
shriek
rang
out
and
there
in
the
doorway
stood
a
woman

to
the
hermit

out
again
and

the
folks
gathered
round

and
his

and
shook
them
by
the
hand
and
congratulated

open

and
found
another
crowd
waiting
for
him
at
the
side
door
let
s
go
up
that
the
left
quick
we
took
to
our
heels

through
a
couple
of
side
streets
and
just
managed
to
get
away
from
the
crowd
it
was
not
till
we
had
gained
the
oxenthorpe
road
that
we
dared
to
slow
down
to
a
walk
and
take
our
breath
and
even
when
we
reached
the
doctor
s
gate
and
turned
to
look
backwards
towards
the
town
the
faint
murmur
of
many
voices
still
reached
us
on
the
evening
wind
they
re
still
clamoring
for
you
i
said
listen
the
murmur
suddenly
swelled
up
into
a
low
distant
roar
and
although
it
was
a
mile
and
half
away
you
could
distinctly
hear
the
words
three
cheers
for

hermit

ninth
the
purple
polynesia
was
waiting
for
us
in
the
front
porch
she
looked
full
of
some
important
news
doctor
said
she
the
purple
has
arrived
at
last
said
the
doctor
i
had
begun
to
fear
some
accident
had
befallen
her
and
how
is
miranda
from
the
excited
way
in
which
the
doctor
fumbled
his
key
into
the
lock
i
guessed
that
we
were
not
going
to
get
our
tea
right
away
even
now
oh
she
seemed
all
right
when
she
arrived
said
tired
from
her
long
journey
of
course
but
otherwise
all
right
but
what
you
think
that
sparrow
cheapside
insulted
her
as
soon
as
she
came
into
the
garden
when
i
arrived
on
the
scene
she
was
in
tears
and
was
all
for
turning
round
and
going
straight
back
to
brazil
i
had
the
hardest
work
persuading
her
to
wait
till
you
came
she
s
in
the
study
i
shut
cheapside
in
one
of
your
and
told
him
i
d
tell
you
exactly
what
had
happened
the
moment
you
got
the
doctor
frowned
then
walked
silently
and
quickly
to
the
study
here
we
found
the
candles
lit
for
the
daylight
was
nearly
gone
was
standing
on
the
floor
mounting
guard
over
one
of
the
in
which
cheapside
had
been
imprisoned
the
noisy
little
sparrow
was
still
fluttering
angrily
behind
the
glass
when
we
came
in
in
the
centre
of
the
big
table
perched
on
the
stood
the
most
beautiful
bird
i
have
ever
seen
she
had
a
deep
breast
scarlet
wings
and
a
long
long
sweeping
tail
of
gold
she
was
unimaginably
beautiful
but
looked
dreadfully
tired
already
she
had
her
head
under
her
wing
and
she
swayed
gently
from
side
to
side
on
top
of
the
like
a
bird
that
has
flown
long
and
far
sh
said
miranda
is
asleep
i
ve
got
this
little
imp
cheapside
in
here
listen
doctor
for
heaven
s
sake
send
that
sparrow
away
before
he
does
any
more
mischief
he
s
nothing
but
a
vulgar
little
nuisance
we
ve
had
a
perfectly
awful
time
trying
to
get
miranda
to
stay
shall
i
serve
your
tea
in
here
or
will
you
come
into
the
kitchen
when
you
re
ready
we
ll
come
into
the
kitchen
said
the
doctor
let
cheapside
out
before
you
go
opened
the
and
cheapside
strutted
out
trying
hard
not
to
look
guilty
cheapside
said
the
doctor
sternly
what
did
you
say
to
miranda
when
she
arrived
i
didn
t
say
nothing
doc
straight
i
didn
t
that
is
nothing
much
i
was
picking
up
crumbs
off
the
gravel
path
when
she
comes
swanking
into
the
garden
turning
up
her
nose
in
all
directions
as
though
she
owned
the
because
she
s
got
a
lot
of
colored
plumage
a
london
sparrow
s
as
good
as
her
any
day
i
don
t
hold
by
these
gawdy
bedizened
foreigners
nohow
why
don
t
they
stay
in
their
own
country
but
what
did
you
say
to
her
that
got
her
so
offended
all
i
said
was
you
don
t
belong
in
an
english
garden
you
ought
to
be
in
a
milliner
s
that
s
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
cheapside
don
t
you
realize
that
this
bird
has
come
thousands
of
miles
to
see
to
be
insulted
by
your
impertinent
tongue
as
soon
as
she
reaches
my
garden
what
do
you
mean
by
it
she
had
gone
away
again
before
i
got
back
i
would
never
have
forgiven
the
sheepishly
but
still
trying
to
look
as
though
he
didn
t
care
cheapside
hopped
out
into
the
passage
and
closed
the
door
the
doctor
went
up
to
the
beautiful
bird
on
the
and
gently
stroked
its
back
instantly
its
head
popped
out
from
under
its
wing
tenth
long
arrow
the
son
of
golden
arrow
well
miranda
said
the
doctor
i
m
terribly
sorry
this
has
happened
but
you
mustn
t
mind
cheapside
he
doesn
t
know
any
better
he
s
a
city
bird
and
all
his
life
he
has
had
to
squabble
for
a
living
you
must
make
allowances
he
doesn
t
know
any
miranda
stretched
her
gorgeous
wings
wearily
now
that
i
saw
her
awake
and
moving
i
noticed
what
a
superior
manner
she
had
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
and
her
beak
was
trembling
i
wouldn
t
have
minded
so
much
she
said
in
a
high
silvery
voice
if
i
hadn
t
been
so
dreadfully
worn
and
something
else
she
added
beneath
her
breath
did
you
have
a
hard
time
getting
here
asked
the
doctor
the
worst
passage
i
ever
made
said
miranda
the
there
what
s
the
use
i
m
here
tell
me
said
the
doctor
as
though
he
had
been
impatiently
waiting
to
say
something
for
a
long
time
what
did
long
arrow
say
when
you
gave
him
my
message
the
purple
hung
her
head
that
s
the
worst
part
of
it
she
said
i
might
almost
as
well
have
not
come
at
all
i
wasn
t
able
to
deliver
your
message
i
couldn
t
find
him
arrow
the
son
of
golden
arrow
has
disappeared
disappeared
cried
the
doctor
why
what
s
become
of
him
nobody
knows
miranda
answered
he
had
often
disappeared
before
as
i
have
told
that
the
indians
didn
t
know
where
he
was
but
it
s
a
mighty
hard
thing
to
hide
away
from
the
birds
i
had
always
been
able
to
find
some
owl
or
martin
who
could
tell
me
where
he
i
wanted
to
know
but
not
this
time
that
s
why
i
m
nearly
a
fortnight
late
in
coming
to
you
i
kept
hunting
and
hunting
asking
everywhere
i
went
over
the
whole
length
and
breadth
of
south
america
but
there
wasn
t
a
living
thing
could
tell
me
where
he
there
was
a
sad
silence
in
the
room
after
she
had
finished
the
doctor
was
frowning
in
a
peculiar
sort
of
way
and
polynesia
scratched
her
head
did
you
ask
the
black
parrots
asked
polynesia
they
usually
know
certainly
i
did
said
miranda
and
i
was
so
upset
at
not
being
able
to
find
out
anything
that
i
forgot
all
about
observing
the
before
i
started
my
flight
here
i
didn
t
even
bother
to
break
my
journey
at
the
azores
but
cut
right
across
making
for
the
straits
of
though
it
were
june
or
july
and
of
course
i
ran
into
a
perfectly
frightful
storm
in
i
really
thought
i
d
never
come
through
it
luckily
i
found
a
piece
of
a
wrecked
vessel
floating
in
the
sea
after
the
storm
had
partly
died
down
and
i
roosted
on
it
and
took
some
sleep
if
i
hadn
t
been
able
to
take
that
rest
i
wouldn
t
be
here
to
tell
the
poor
miranda
what
a
time
you
must
have
had
said
the
doctor
but
tell
me
were
you
able
to
find
out
whereabouts
long
arrow
was
last
seen
yes
a
young
albatross
told
me
he
had
seen
him
on
spidermonkey
island
spidermonkey
island
that
s
somewhere
off
the
coast
of
brazil
isn
t
it
yes
that
s
it
of
course
i
flew
there
right
away
and
asked
every
bird
on
the
it
is
a
big
island
a
hundred
miles
long
it
seems
that
long
arrow
was
visiting
some
peculiar
indians
that
live
there
and
that
when
last
seen
he
was
going
up
into
the
mountains
looking
for
rare
i
got
that
from
a
tame
hawk
a
pet
which
the
chief
of
the
indians
keeps
for
hunting
partridges
with
i
nearly
got
caught
and
put
in
a
cage
for
my
pains
too
that
s
the
worst
of
having
beautiful
feathers
it
s
as
much
as
your
life
is
worth
to
go
near
most
say
oh
how
pretty
and
shoot
an
arrow
or
a
bullet
into
you
you
and
long
arrow
were
the
only
two
men
that
i
would
ever
trust
myself
of
all
the
people
in
the
but
was
he
never
known
to
have
returned
from
the
mountains
no
that
was
the
last
that
was
seen
or
heard
of
him
i
questioned
the
around
the
shores
to
find
out
if
he
had
left
the
island
in
a
canoe
but
they
could
tell
me
do
you
think
that
some
accident
has
happened
to
him
asked
the
doctor
in
a
fearful
voice
i
m
afraid
it
must
have
said
miranda
shaking
her
head
well
said
john
dolittle
slowly
if
i
could
never
meet
long
arrow
face
to
face
it
would
be
the
greatest
disappointment
in
my
whole
life
not
only
that
but
it
would
be
a
great
loss
to
the
knowledge
of
the
human
race
for
from
what
you
have
told
me
of
him
he
knew
more
natural
science
than
all
the
rest
of
us
put
together
and
if
he
has
gone
without
any
one
to
write
it
down
for
him
so
the
world
may
be
the
better
for
it
it
would
be
a
terrible
thing
but
you
don
t
really
think
that
he
is
dead
do
you
illustration
what
else
can
i
think
what
else
can
i
think
asked
miranda
bursting
into
tears
when
for
six
whole
months
he
has
not
been
seen
by
flesh
fish
or
eleventh
blind
travel
this
news
about
long
arrow
made
us
all
very
sad
and
i
could
see
from
the
silent
dreamy
way
the
doctor
took
his
tea
that
he
was
dreadfully
upset
every
once
in
a
while
he
would
stop
eating
altogether
and
sit
staring
at
the
spots
on
the
kitchen
as
though
his
thoughts
were
far
away
till
who
was
watching
to
see
that
he
got
a
good
meal
would
cough
or
rattle
the
pots
in
the
sink
i
did
my
best
to
cheer
him
up
by
reminding
him
of
all
he
had
done
for
luke
and
his
wife
that
afternoon
and
when
that
didn
t
seem
to
work
i
went
on
talking
about
our
preparations
for
the
voyage
but
you
see
stubbins
said
he
as
we
rose
from
the
table
and
and
began
to
clear
away
i
don
t
know
where
to
go
now
i
feel
sort
of
lost
since
miranda
brought
me
this
news
on
this
voyage
i
had
planned
going
to
see
long
arrow
i
had
been
looking
forward
to
it
for
a
whole
year
i
felt
he
might
help
me
in
learning
the
language
of
the
perhaps
in
finding
some
way
of
getting
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
but
now
s
gone
and
all
his
great
knowledge
has
gone
with
then
he
seemed
to
fall
again
just
to
think
of
it
he
murmured
long
arrow
and
i
two
i
d
never
met
him
i
felt
as
though
i
knew
him
quite
well
for
in
his
any
has
all
his
life
been
trying
to
do
the
very
things
which
i
have
tried
to
do
in
now
he
s
gone
whole
world
lay
between
only
a
bird
knew
us
both
we
went
back
into
the
study
where
jip
brought
the
doctor
his
slippers
and
his
pipe
and
after
the
pipe
was
lit
and
the
smoke
began
to
fill
the
room
the
old
man
seemed
to
cheer
up
a
little
but
you
will
go
on
some
voyage
doctor
won
t
you
i
even
if
you
can
t
go
to
find
long
he
looked
up
sharply
into
my
face
and
i
suppose
he
saw
how
anxious
i
was
because
he
suddenly
smiled
his
old
boyish
smile
and
said
yes
stubbins
don
t
worry
we
ll
go
we
mustn
t
stop
working
and
learning
even
if
poor
long
arrow
has
where
to
go
that
s
the
question
where
shall
we
go
there
were
so
many
places
that
i
wanted
to
go
that
i
couldn
t
make
up
my
mind
right
away
and
while
i
was
still
thinking
the
doctor
sat
up
in
his
chair
and
said
i
tell
you
what
we
ll
do
stubbins
it
s
a
game
i
used
to
play
when
i
was
sarah
came
to
live
with
me
i
used
to
call
it
blind
travel
whenever
i
wanted
to
go
on
a
voyage
and
i
couldn
t
make
up
my
mind
where
to
go
i
would
take
the
atlas
and
open
it
with
my
eyes
shut
next
i
d
wave
a
pencil
still
without
looking
and
stick
it
down
on
whatever
page
had
fallen
open
then
i
d
open
my
eyes
and
look
it
s
a
very
exciting
game
is
blind
travel
because
you
have
to
swear
before
you
begin
that
you
will
go
to
the
place
the
pencil
touches
come
what
may
shall
we
play
it
oh
let
s
i
almost
yelled
how
thrilling
i
hope
it
s
and
in
a
moment
i
had
scrambled
up
the
bookcase
dragged
the
big
atlas
from
the
top
shelf
and
laid
it
on
the
table
before
the
doctor
i
knew
every
page
in
that
atlas
by
heart
how
many
days
and
nights
i
had
lingered
over
its
old
faded
maps
following
the
blue
rivers
from
the
mountains
to
the
sea
wondering
what
the
little
towns
really
looked
like
and
how
wide
were
the
sprawling
lakes
i
had
had
a
lot
of
fun
with
that
atlas
traveling
in
my
mind
all
over
the
world
i
can
see
it
now
the
first
page
had
no
map
it
just
told
you
that
it
was
printed
in
edinburgh
in
and
a
whole
lot
more
about
the
book
the
next
page
was
the
solar
system
showing
the
sun
and
planets
the
stars
and
the
moon
the
third
page
was
the
chart
of
the
north
and
south
poles
then
came
the
hemispheres
the
oceans
the
continents
and
the
countries
as
the
doctor
began
sharpening
his
pencil
a
thought
came
to
me
what
if
the
pencil
falls
upon
the
north
pole
i
asked
will
we
have
to
go
there
no
the
rules
of
the
game
say
you
don
t
have
to
go
any
place
you
ve
been
to
before
you
are
allowed
another
try
i
ve
been
to
the
north
pole
he
ended
quietly
so
we
shan
t
have
to
go
i
could
hardly
speak
with
astonishment
ve
been
to
the
north
pole
i
managed
to
gasp
out
at
last
but
i
thought
it
was
still
undiscovered
the
map
shows
all
the
places
explorers
have
reached
to
to
get
there
why
isn
t
your
name
down
if
you
discovered
it
i
promised
to
keep
it
a
secret
and
you
must
promise
me
never
to
tell
any
one
yes
i
discovered
the
north
pole
in
april
but
shortly
after
i
got
there
the
polar
bears
came
to
me
in
a
body
and
told
me
there
was
a
great
deal
of
coal
there
buried
beneath
the
snow
they
knew
they
said
that
human
beings
would
do
anything
and
go
anywhere
to
get
coal
so
would
i
please
keep
it
a
secret
because
once
people
began
coming
up
there
to
start
their
beautiful
white
country
would
be
there
was
nowhere
else
in
the
world
cold
enough
for
polar
bears
to
be
comfortable
so
of
course
i
had
to
promise
them
i
would
ah
well
it
will
be
discovered
again
some
day
by
somebody
else
but
i
want
the
polar
bears
to
have
their
to
themselves
as
long
as
possible
and
i
daresay
it
will
be
a
good
while
it
certainly
is
a
fiendish
place
to
get
now
are
we
ready
take
the
pencil
and
stand
here
close
to
the
table
when
the
book
falls
open
wave
the
pencil
round
three
times
and
jab
it
down
ready
right
shut
your
it
was
a
tense
and
fearful
very
thrilling
we
both
had
our
eyes
shut
tight
i
heard
the
atlas
fall
open
with
a
bang
i
wondered
what
page
it
was
england
or
asia
if
it
should
be
the
map
of
asia
so
much
would
depend
on
where
that
pencil
would
land
i
waved
three
times
in
a
circle
i
began
to
lower
my
hand
the
touched
the
page
all
right
i
called
out
it
s
twelfth
destiny
and
destination
we
both
opened
our
eyes
then
bumped
our
heads
together
with
a
crack
in
our
eagerness
to
lean
over
and
see
where
we
were
to
go
the
atlas
lay
open
at
a
map
called
of
the
south
atlantic
my
was
resting
right
in
the
center
of
a
tiny
island
the
name
of
it
was
printed
so
small
that
the
doctor
had
to
get
out
his
strong
spectacles
to
read
it
i
was
trembling
with
excitement
he
read
out
slowly
then
he
whistled
softly
beneath
his
breath
of
all
the
extraordinary
things
you
ve
hit
upon
the
very
island
where
long
arrow
was
last
seen
on
well
how
very
singular
we
ll
go
there
doctor
won
t
we
i
asked
of
course
we
will
the
rules
of
the
game
say
we
ve
got
i
m
so
glad
it
wasn
t
oxenthorpe
or
bristol
i
said
it
ll
be
a
grand
voyage
this
look
at
all
the
sea
we
ve
got
to
cross
will
it
take
us
long
oh
no
said
the
not
very
with
a
good
boat
and
a
good
wind
we
should
make
it
easily
in
four
weeks
but
isn
t
it
extraordinary
of
all
the
places
in
the
world
you
picked
out
that
one
with
your
eyes
shut
spidermonkey
island
after
all
there
s
one
good
thing
about
it
i
shall
be
able
to
get
some
jabizri
what
are
jabizri
beetles
they
are
a
very
rare
kind
of
beetles
with
peculiar
habits
i
want
to
study
them
there
are
only
three
countries
in
the
world
where
they
are
to
be
found
spidermonkey
island
is
one
of
them
but
even
there
they
are
very
what
is
this
little
after
the
name
of
the
island
for
i
asked
pointing
to
the
map
that
means
that
the
island
s
position
in
the
ocean
is
not
known
very
it
is
somewhere
there
ships
have
probably
seen
it
in
that
neighborhood
that
is
all
most
likely
it
is
quite
possible
we
shall
be
the
first
white
men
to
land
there
but
i
daresay
we
shall
have
some
difficulty
in
finding
it
how
like
a
dream
it
all
sounded
the
two
of
us
sitting
there
at
the
big
the
candles
lit
the
smoke
curling
towards
the
dim
ceiling
from
the
doctor
s
two
of
us
sitting
there
talking
about
finding
an
island
in
the
ocean
and
being
the
first
white
men
to
land
upon
it
i
ll
bet
it
will
be
a
great
voyage
i
said
it
looks
a
lovely
island
on
the
map
will
there
be
black
men
there
no
a
peculiar
tribe
of
red
indians
lives
on
it
miranda
tells
at
this
point
the
poor
stirred
and
woke
up
in
our
excitement
we
had
forgotten
to
speak
low
we
are
going
to
spidermonkey
island
miranda
said
the
doctor
you
know
where
it
is
do
you
not
i
know
where
it
was
the
last
time
i
saw
it
said
the
bird
but
whether
it
will
be
there
still
i
can
t
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
doctor
it
is
always
in
the
same
place
surely
not
by
any
means
said
miranda
why
didn
t
you
know
island
is
a
island
it
moves
around
all
over
the
somewhere
near
southern
south
america
but
of
course
i
could
surely
find
it
for
you
if
you
want
to
go
at
this
fresh
piece
of
news
i
could
contain
myself
no
longer
i
was
bursting
to
tell
some
one
i
ran
dancing
and
singing
from
the
room
to
find
at
the
door
i
tripped
over
who
was
just
coming
in
with
her
wings
full
of
plates
and
fell
headlong
on
my
nose
has
the
boy
gone
crazy
cried
the
duck
where
do
you
think
you
re
going
ninny
to
spidermonkey
island
i
shouted
picking
myself
up
and
doing
down
the
spidermonkey
island
hooray
it
s
a
island
you
re
going
to
bedlam
i
should
say
snorted
the
housekeeper
look
what
you
ve
done
to
my
best
china
but
i
was
far
too
happy
to
listen
to
her
scolding
and
i
ran
on
singing
into
the
kitchen
to
find
illustration
part
three
first
the
third
man
that
same
week
we
began
our
preparations
for
the
voyage
joe
the
had
the
moved
down
the
river
and
tied
it
up
along
the
so
it
would
be
more
handy
for
loading
and
for
three
whole
days
we
carried
provisions
down
to
our
beautiful
new
boat
and
stowed
them
away
i
was
surprised
to
find
how
roomy
and
big
she
was
inside
there
were
three
little
cabins
a
saloon
or
and
underneath
all
this
a
big
place
called
the
hold
where
the
food
and
extra
sails
and
other
things
were
kept
i
think
joe
must
have
told
everybody
in
the
town
about
our
coming
voyage
because
there
was
always
a
regular
crowd
watching
us
when
we
brought
the
things
down
to
put
aboard
and
of
course
sooner
or
later
old
matthew
mugg
was
bound
to
turn
up
my
goodness
tommy
said
he
as
he
watched
me
carrying
on
some
sacks
of
flour
but
that
s
a
pretty
boat
where
might
the
doctor
be
going
to
this
voyage
we
re
going
to
spidermonkey
island
i
said
proudly
and
be
you
the
only
one
the
doctor
s
taking
along
well
he
has
spoken
of
wanting
to
take
another
man
i
said
but
so
far
he
hasn
t
made
up
his
matthew
grunted
then
squinted
up
at
the
graceful
masts
of
the
you
know
tommy
said
he
if
it
wasn
t
for
my
rheumatism
i
ve
half
a
mind
to
come
with
the
doctor
myself
there
s
something
about
a
boat
standing
ready
to
sail
that
always
did
make
me
feel
venturesome
and
what
s
that
stuff
in
the
cans
you
re
taking
on
this
is
treacle
i
twenty
pounds
of
my
goodness
he
sighed
turning
away
sadly
that
makes
me
feel
more
like
going
with
you
than
my
rheumatism
is
that
bad
i
can
t
i
didn
t
hear
any
more
for
matthew
had
moved
off
still
mumbling
into
the
crowd
that
stood
about
the
wharf
the
clock
in
puddleby
church
struck
noon
and
i
turned
back
feeling
very
busy
and
important
to
the
task
of
loading
but
it
wasn
t
very
long
before
some
one
else
came
along
and
interrupted
my
work
this
was
a
huge
big
burly
man
with
a
red
beard
and
all
over
his
arms
he
wiped
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand
spat
twice
on
to
the
and
said
boy
where
s
the
skipper
the
do
you
mean
i
asked
the
s
the
captain
of
this
craft
he
said
pointing
to
the
oh
you
mean
the
doctor
said
i
well
he
isn
t
here
at
at
that
moment
the
doctor
arrived
with
his
arms
full
of
and
and
glass
cases
and
other
natural
history
things
the
big
man
went
up
to
him
respectfully
touching
his
cap
good
morning
captain
said
he
i
heard
you
was
in
need
of
hands
for
a
voyage
my
name
s
ben
butcher
able
i
am
very
glad
to
know
you
said
the
doctor
but
i
m
afraid
i
shan
t
be
able
to
take
on
any
more
why
but
captain
said
the
able
seaman
you
surely
ain
t
going
to
face
weather
with
nothing
more
than
this
bit
of
a
lad
to
help
with
a
cutter
that
big
the
doctor
assured
him
that
he
was
but
the
man
didn
t
go
away
he
hung
around
and
argued
he
told
us
he
had
known
of
many
ships
being
sunk
through
he
got
out
what
he
called
his
paper
which
said
what
a
good
sailor
he
implored
us
if
we
valued
our
lives
to
take
him
illustration
boy
where
s
the
skipper
but
the
doctor
was
quite
but
finally
the
man
walked
sorrowfully
away
telling
us
he
never
expected
to
see
us
alive
again
callers
of
one
sort
and
another
kept
us
quite
busy
that
morning
the
doctor
had
no
sooner
gone
below
to
stow
away
his
than
another
visitor
appeared
upon
the
this
was
a
most
black
man
the
only
other
negroes
i
had
seen
had
been
in
circuses
where
they
wore
feathers
and
bone
necklaces
and
things
like
that
but
this
one
was
dressed
in
a
fashionable
frock
coat
with
an
enormous
bright
red
cravat
on
his
head
was
a
straw
hat
with
a
gay
band
and
over
this
he
held
a
large
green
umbrella
he
was
very
smart
in
every
respect
except
his
feet
he
wore
no
shoes
or
socks
pardon
me
said
he
bowing
elegantly
but
is
this
the
ship
of
the
physician
dolittle
yes
i
said
did
you
wish
to
see
him
i
it
will
not
be
discommodious
he
answered
who
shall
i
say
it
is
i
am
bumpo
kahbooboo
crown
prince
of
i
ran
downstairs
at
once
and
told
the
doctor
how
fortunate
cried
john
dolittle
my
old
friend
bumpo
well
well
s
studying
at
oxford
you
know
how
good
of
him
to
come
all
this
way
to
call
on
me
and
he
tumbled
up
the
ladder
to
greet
his
visitor
the
strange
black
man
seemed
to
be
overcome
with
joy
when
the
doctor
appeared
and
shook
him
warmly
by
the
hand
news
reached
me
he
said
that
you
were
about
to
sail
upon
a
voyage
i
hastened
to
see
you
before
your
departure
i
am
sublimely
ecstasied
that
i
did
not
miss
you
very
nearly
did
miss
us
said
the
doctor
as
it
happened
we
were
delayed
somewhat
in
getting
the
necessary
number
of
men
to
sail
our
boat
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
that
we
would
have
been
gone
three
days
how
many
men
does
your
ship
s
company
yet
require
asked
bumpo
only
one
said
the
but
it
is
so
hard
to
find
the
right
methinks
i
detect
something
of
the
finger
of
destination
in
this
said
bumpo
how
would
i
do
splendidly
said
the
doctor
but
what
about
your
studies
you
can
t
very
well
just
go
off
and
leave
your
university
career
to
take
care
of
itself
you
i
need
a
holiday
said
bumpo
even
had
i
not
gone
with
you
i
intended
at
the
end
of
this
term
to
take
a
besides
i
shall
not
be
neglecting
my
edification
if
i
accompany
you
before
i
left
jolliginki
my
august
father
the
king
told
me
to
be
sure
and
travel
plenty
you
are
a
man
of
great
studiosity
to
see
the
world
in
your
company
is
an
opportunity
not
to
be
sneezed
upon
no
no
how
did
you
like
the
life
at
oxford
asked
the
doctor
oh
passably
passably
said
bumpo
i
liked
it
all
except
the
algebra
and
the
shoes
the
algebra
hurt
my
head
and
the
shoes
hurt
my
feet
i
threw
the
shoes
over
a
wall
as
soon
as
i
got
out
of
the
college
quadrilateral
this
morning
and
the
algebra
i
am
happily
forgetting
very
liked
i
think
cicero
s
simultaneous
by
the
way
they
tell
me
his
son
is
rowing
for
our
college
next
the
doctor
looked
down
at
the
black
man
s
huge
bare
feet
thoughtfully
a
moment
well
he
said
slowly
there
is
something
in
what
you
say
bumpo
about
getting
education
from
the
world
as
well
as
from
the
college
and
if
you
are
really
sure
that
you
want
to
come
we
shall
be
delighted
to
have
you
because
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
think
you
are
exactly
the
man
we
second
two
days
after
that
we
had
all
in
readiness
for
our
departure
on
this
voyage
jip
begged
so
hard
to
be
taken
that
the
doctor
finally
gave
in
and
said
he
could
come
polynesia
and
were
the
only
other
animals
to
go
with
us
was
left
in
charge
of
the
house
and
the
animal
family
we
were
to
leave
behind
of
course
as
is
always
the
way
at
the
last
moment
we
kept
remembering
things
we
had
forgotten
and
when
we
finally
closed
the
house
up
and
went
down
the
steps
to
the
road
we
were
all
burdened
with
armfuls
of
odd
packages
halfway
to
the
river
the
doctor
suddenly
remembered
that
he
had
left
the
boiling
on
the
however
we
saw
a
blackbird
flying
by
who
nested
in
our
garden
and
the
doctor
asked
her
to
go
back
for
us
and
tell
about
it
down
at
the
we
found
a
great
crowd
waiting
to
see
us
off
standing
right
near
the
were
my
mother
and
father
i
hoped
that
they
would
not
make
a
scene
or
burst
into
tears
or
anything
like
that
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
behaved
quite
parents
my
mother
said
something
about
being
sure
not
to
get
my
feet
wet
and
my
father
just
smiled
a
crooked
sort
of
smile
patted
me
on
the
back
and
wished
me
luck
are
awfully
uncomfortable
things
and
i
was
glad
when
it
was
over
and
we
passed
on
to
the
ship
we
were
a
little
surprised
not
to
see
matthew
mugg
among
the
crowd
we
had
felt
sure
that
he
would
be
there
and
the
doctor
had
intended
to
give
him
some
extra
instructions
about
the
food
for
the
animals
we
had
left
at
the
house
at
last
after
much
pulling
and
tugging
we
got
the
anchor
up
and
undid
a
lot
of
then
the
began
to
move
gently
down
the
river
with
the
tide
while
the
people
on
the
wall
cheered
and
waved
their
handkerchiefs
we
bumped
into
one
or
two
other
boats
getting
out
into
the
stream
and
at
one
sharp
bend
in
the
river
we
got
stuck
on
a
mud
bank
for
a
few
minutes
but
though
the
people
on
the
shore
seemed
to
get
very
excited
at
these
things
the
doctor
did
not
appear
to
be
disturbed
by
them
in
the
least
these
little
accidents
will
happen
in
the
most
carefully
regulated
voyages
he
said
as
he
leaned
over
the
side
and
fished
for
his
boots
which
had
got
stuck
in
the
mud
while
we
were
pushing
off
sailing
is
much
easier
when
you
get
out
into
the
open
sea
there
aren
t
so
many
silly
things
to
bump
for
me
indeed
it
was
a
great
and
wonderful
feeling
that
getting
out
into
the
open
sea
when
at
length
we
passed
the
little
lighthouse
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
found
ourselves
free
of
the
land
it
was
all
so
new
and
different
just
the
sky
above
you
and
sea
below
this
ship
which
was
to
be
our
house
and
our
street
our
home
and
our
garden
for
so
many
days
to
come
seemed
so
tiny
in
all
this
wide
tiny
and
yet
so
snug
sufficient
safe
i
looked
around
me
and
took
in
a
deep
breath
the
doctor
was
at
the
wheel
steering
the
boat
which
was
now
leaping
and
plunging
gently
through
the
waves
i
had
expected
to
feel
seasick
at
first
but
was
delighted
to
find
that
i
didn
t
bumpo
had
been
told
off
to
go
downstairs
and
prepare
dinner
for
us
was
coiling
up
ropes
in
the
stern
and
laying
them
in
neat
piles
my
work
was
fastening
down
the
things
on
the
deck
so
that
nothing
could
roll
about
if
the
weather
should
grow
rough
when
we
got
further
from
the
land
jip
was
up
in
the
peak
of
the
boat
with
ears
cocked
and
nose
stuck
a
statue
so
keen
old
eyes
keeping
a
sharp
for
floating
wrecks
and
other
dangers
each
one
of
us
had
some
special
job
to
do
part
of
the
proper
running
of
a
ship
even
old
polynesia
was
taking
the
sea
s
temperature
with
the
doctor
s
tied
on
the
end
of
a
string
to
make
sure
there
were
no
icebergs
near
us
as
i
listened
to
her
swearing
softly
to
herself
because
she
couldn
t
read
the
pesky
figures
in
the
fading
light
i
realized
that
the
voyage
had
begun
in
earnest
and
that
very
soon
it
would
be
first
night
at
sea
third
our
troubles
begin
just
before
bumpo
appeared
from
downstairs
and
went
to
the
doctor
at
the
wheel
a
stowaway
in
the
hold
sir
said
he
in
a
very
seafaring
voice
i
just
discovered
him
behind
the
dear
me
said
the
doctor
what
a
nuisance
stubbins
go
down
with
bumpo
and
bring
the
man
up
i
can
t
leave
the
wheel
just
so
bumpo
and
i
went
down
into
the
hold
and
there
behind
the
plastered
in
flour
from
head
to
foot
we
found
a
man
after
we
had
swept
most
of
the
flour
off
him
with
a
broom
we
discovered
that
it
was
matthew
mugg
we
hauled
him
upstairs
sneezing
and
took
him
before
the
doctor
why
matthew
said
john
dolittle
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
here
the
temptation
was
too
much
for
me
doctor
said
the
cat
you
know
i
ve
often
asked
you
to
take
me
on
voyages
with
you
and
you
never
would
well
this
time
knowing
that
you
needed
an
extra
man
i
thought
if
i
stayed
hid
till
the
ship
was
well
at
sea
you
would
find
i
came
in
handy
like
and
keep
me
but
i
had
to
lie
so
doubled
up
for
hours
behind
them
that
my
rheumatism
came
on
something
awful
i
just
had
to
change
my
position
and
of
course
just
as
i
stretched
out
my
legs
along
comes
this
here
african
cook
of
yours
and
sees
my
feet
sticking
t
this
ship
roll
something
awful
how
long
has
this
storm
been
going
on
i
reckon
this
damp
sea
air
wouldn
t
be
very
good
for
my
no
matthew
it
really
isn
t
you
ought
not
to
have
come
you
are
not
in
any
way
suited
to
this
kind
of
a
life
i
m
sure
you
wouldn
t
enjoy
a
long
voyage
a
bit
we
ll
stop
in
at
penzance
and
put
you
ashore
bumpo
please
go
downstairs
to
my
bunk
and
listen
in
the
pocket
of
my
you
ll
find
some
maps
bring
me
the
small
blue
at
the
top
i
know
penzance
is
over
here
on
our
left
somewhere
but
i
must
find
out
what
there
are
before
i
change
the
ship
s
course
and
sail
very
good
sir
said
bumpo
turning
round
smartly
and
making
for
the
stairway
now
matthew
said
the
doctor
you
can
take
the
coach
from
penzance
to
bristol
and
from
there
it
is
not
very
far
to
puddleby
as
you
know
don
t
forget
to
take
the
usual
provisions
to
the
house
every
thursday
and
be
particularly
careful
to
remember
the
extra
supply
of
herrings
for
the
baby
while
we
were
waiting
for
the
maps
and
i
set
about
lighting
the
lamps
a
green
one
on
the
right
side
of
the
ship
a
red
one
on
the
left
and
a
white
one
on
the
mast
at
last
we
heard
some
one
trundling
on
the
stairs
again
and
the
doctor
said
ah
here
s
bumpo
with
the
maps
at
last
but
to
our
great
astonishment
it
was
not
bumpo
alone
that
appeared
but
people
good
lord
deliver
us
who
are
these
cried
john
dolittle
two
more
stowaways
sir
said
bumpo
stepping
forward
briskly
i
found
them
in
your
cabin
hiding
under
the
bunk
one
woman
and
one
man
sir
here
are
the
this
is
too
much
said
the
doctor
feebly
who
are
they
i
can
t
see
their
faces
in
this
dim
light
strike
a
match
you
could
never
guess
who
it
was
it
was
luke
and
his
wife
luke
appeared
to
be
very
miserable
and
seasick
they
explained
to
the
doctor
that
after
they
had
settled
down
to
live
together
in
the
little
shack
out
on
the
fens
so
many
people
came
to
visit
them
having
heard
about
the
great
trial
that
life
became
impossible
and
they
had
decided
to
escape
from
puddleby
in
this
they
had
no
money
to
leave
any
other
try
to
find
some
new
place
to
live
where
they
and
their
story
wouldn
t
be
so
well
known
but
as
soon
as
the
ship
had
begun
to
roll
luke
had
got
most
dreadfully
unwell
poor
luke
apologized
many
times
for
being
such
a
nuisance
and
said
that
the
whole
thing
had
been
his
wife
s
idea
the
doctor
after
he
had
sent
below
for
his
and
had
given
luke
some
and
said
he
thought
the
best
thing
to
do
would
be
for
him
to
lend
them
some
money
and
put
them
ashore
at
penzance
with
matthew
he
also
wrote
a
letter
for
luke
to
take
with
him
to
a
friend
the
doctor
had
in
the
town
of
penzance
who
it
was
hoped
would
be
able
to
find
luke
work
to
do
there
as
the
doctor
opened
his
purse
and
took
out
some
gold
coins
i
heard
polynesia
who
was
sitting
on
my
shoulder
watching
the
whole
affair
mutter
beneath
her
breath
there
he
his
last
blessed
pounds
the
money
we
had
for
the
whole
trip
now
we
haven
t
the
price
of
a
aboard
if
we
should
lose
an
anchor
or
have
to
buy
a
pint
of
let
s
pray
we
don
t
run
out
of
doesn
t
he
give
them
the
ship
and
walk
home
presently
with
the
help
of
the
map
the
course
of
the
boat
was
changed
and
to
luke
s
great
relief
we
made
for
penzance
and
dry
land
i
was
tremendously
interested
to
see
how
a
ship
could
be
steered
into
a
port
at
night
with
nothing
but
and
a
compass
to
guide
you
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
doctor
missed
all
the
rocks
and
very
cleverly
we
got
into
that
funny
little
cornish
harbor
about
eleven
o
clock
that
night
the
doctor
took
his
stowaways
on
shore
in
our
small
which
we
kept
on
the
deck
of
the
and
found
them
rooms
at
the
hotel
there
when
he
got
back
he
told
us
that
luke
had
gone
straight
to
bed
and
was
feeling
much
better
it
was
now
after
midnight
so
we
decided
to
stay
in
the
harbor
and
wait
till
morning
before
setting
out
again
i
was
glad
to
get
to
bed
although
i
felt
that
staying
up
so
tremendously
late
was
great
fun
as
i
climbed
into
the
bunk
over
the
doctor
s
and
pulled
the
blankets
snugly
round
me
i
found
i
could
look
out
of
the
at
my
elbow
and
without
raising
my
head
from
the
pillow
could
see
the
lights
of
penzance
swinging
gently
up
and
down
with
the
motion
of
the
ship
at
anchor
it
was
like
being
rocked
to
sleep
with
a
little
show
going
on
to
amuse
you
i
was
just
deciding
that
i
liked
the
life
of
the
sea
very
much
when
i
fell
fast
asleep
fourth
our
troubles
continue
the
next
morning
when
we
were
eating
a
very
excellent
breakfast
of
kidneys
and
bacon
prepared
by
our
good
cook
bumpo
the
doctor
said
to
me
i
was
just
wondering
stubbins
whether
i
should
stop
at
the
capa
blanca
islands
or
run
right
across
for
the
coast
of
brazil
miranda
said
we
could
expect
a
spell
of
excellent
weather
four
and
a
half
weeks
at
well
i
said
spooning
out
the
sugar
at
the
bottom
of
my
i
should
think
it
would
be
best
to
make
straight
across
while
we
are
sure
of
good
weather
and
besides
the
purple
is
going
to
keep
a
lookout
for
us
isn
t
she
she
ll
be
wondering
what
s
happened
to
us
if
we
don
t
get
there
in
about
a
true
quite
true
stubbins
on
the
other
hand
the
capa
blancas
make
a
very
convenient
stopping
place
on
our
way
across
if
we
should
need
supplies
or
repairs
it
would
be
very
handy
to
put
in
how
long
will
it
take
us
from
here
to
the
capa
blancas
i
asked
about
six
days
said
the
well
we
can
decide
later
for
the
next
two
days
at
any
rate
our
direction
would
be
the
same
practically
in
either
case
if
you
have
finished
breakfast
let
s
go
and
get
under
upstairs
i
found
our
vessel
surrounded
by
white
and
gray
seagulls
who
flashed
and
circled
about
in
the
sunny
morning
air
looking
for
thrown
out
by
the
ships
into
the
harbor
by
about
half
past
seven
we
had
the
anchor
up
and
the
sails
set
to
a
nice
steady
breeze
and
this
time
we
got
out
into
the
open
sea
without
bumping
into
a
single
thing
we
met
the
penzance
fishing
fleet
coming
in
from
the
night
s
fishing
and
very
trim
and
neat
they
looked
in
a
line
like
soldiers
with
their
sails
all
leaning
over
the
same
way
and
the
white
water
dancing
before
their
bows
for
the
next
three
or
four
days
everything
went
smoothly
and
nothing
unusual
happened
during
this
time
we
all
got
settled
down
into
our
regular
jobs
and
in
spare
moments
the
doctor
showed
each
of
us
how
to
take
our
turns
at
the
wheel
the
proper
manner
of
keeping
a
ship
on
her
right
course
and
what
to
do
if
the
wind
changed
suddenly
we
divided
the
hours
of
the
day
into
three
spells
and
we
took
it
in
turns
to
sleep
our
eight
hours
and
be
awake
sixteen
so
the
ship
was
well
looked
after
with
two
of
us
always
on
duty
besides
that
polynesia
who
was
an
older
sailor
than
any
of
us
and
really
knew
a
lot
about
running
ships
seemed
to
be
always
when
she
took
her
couple
of
winks
in
the
sun
standing
on
one
leg
beside
the
wheel
you
may
be
sure
that
no
one
ever
got
a
chance
to
stay
abed
more
than
his
eight
hours
while
polynesia
was
around
she
used
to
watch
the
ship
s
clock
and
if
you
overslept
a
she
would
come
down
to
the
cabin
and
peck
you
gently
on
the
nose
till
you
got
up
i
very
soon
grew
to
be
quite
fond
of
our
funny
black
friend
bumpo
with
his
grand
way
of
speaking
and
his
enormous
feet
which
some
one
was
always
stepping
on
or
falling
over
although
he
was
much
older
than
i
was
and
had
been
to
college
he
never
tried
to
lord
it
over
me
he
seemed
to
be
forever
smiling
and
kept
all
of
us
in
good
humor
it
wasn
t
long
before
i
began
to
see
the
doctor
s
good
sense
in
bringing
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
knew
nothing
whatever
about
sailing
or
travel
on
the
morning
of
the
fifth
day
out
just
as
i
was
taking
the
wheel
over
from
the
doctor
bumpo
appeared
and
said
the
salt
beef
is
nearly
all
gone
the
salt
beef
cried
the
doctor
why
we
brought
a
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
with
us
we
couldn
t
have
eaten
that
in
five
days
what
can
have
become
of
it
illustration
in
these
lower
levels
we
came
upon
the
shadowy
shapes
of
dead
ships
i
don
t
know
sir
i
m
sure
every
time
i
go
down
to
the
stores
i
find
another
hunk
missing
if
it
is
rats
that
are
eating
it
then
they
are
certainly
colossal
polynesia
who
was
walking
up
and
down
a
taking
her
morning
exercise
put
in
we
must
search
the
hold
if
this
is
allowed
to
go
on
we
will
all
be
starving
before
a
week
is
out
come
downstairs
with
me
tommy
and
we
will
look
into
this
so
we
went
downstairs
into
the
and
polynesia
told
us
to
keep
quite
still
and
listen
this
we
did
and
presently
we
heard
from
a
dark
corner
of
the
hold
the
distinct
sound
of
someone
snoring
ah
i
thought
so
said
polynesia
it
s
a
a
big
one
climb
in
there
both
of
you
and
haul
him
out
it
sounds
as
though
he
were
behind
that
we
seem
to
have
brought
half
of
puddleby
with
us
anyone
would
think
we
were
a
penny
such
cheek
haul
him
so
bumpo
and
i
lit
a
lantern
and
climbed
over
the
stores
and
there
behind
the
barrel
sure
enough
we
found
an
enormous
bearded
man
fast
asleep
with
a
look
on
his
face
we
woke
him
up
washamarrer
he
said
sleepily
it
was
ben
butcher
the
able
seaman
polynesia
spluttered
like
an
angry
this
is
the
last
straw
said
she
the
one
man
in
the
world
we
least
wanted
shiver
my
timbers
what
cheek
would
it
not
be
advisable
suggested
bumpo
while
the
varlet
is
still
sleepy
to
strike
him
on
the
head
with
some
heavy
object
and
push
him
through
a
into
the
sea
no
we
d
get
into
trouble
said
polynesia
we
re
not
in
jolliginki
now
you
luck
there
never
was
a
big
enough
to
push
that
man
through
bring
him
upstairs
to
the
so
we
led
the
man
to
the
wheel
where
he
respectfully
touched
his
cap
to
the
doctor
another
stowaway
sir
said
bumpo
smartly
i
thought
the
poor
doctor
would
have
a
fit
good
morning
captain
said
the
man
ben
butcher
able
seaman
at
your
service
i
knew
you
d
need
me
so
i
took
the
liberty
of
stowing
against
my
conscience
but
i
just
couldn
t
bear
to
see
you
poor
landsmen
set
out
on
this
voyage
without
a
single
real
seaman
to
help
you
you
d
never
have
got
home
alive
if
i
hadn
t
look
at
your
mainsail
loose
at
the
throat
first
gust
of
wind
come
along
and
away
goes
your
canvas
it
s
all
right
now
i
m
here
we
ll
soon
get
things
in
no
it
isn
t
all
right
said
the
doctor
it
s
all
wrong
and
i
m
not
at
all
glad
to
see
you
i
told
you
in
puddleby
i
didn
t
want
you
you
had
no
right
to
but
captain
said
the
able
seaman
you
can
t
sail
this
ship
without
me
you
don
t
understand
navigation
why
look
at
the
compass
now
you
ve
let
her
swing
a
point
and
a
half
off
her
course
it
s
madness
for
you
to
try
to
do
this
trip
you
ll
pardon
my
saying
so
sir
you
ll
lose
the
ship
look
here
said
the
doctor
a
sudden
stern
look
coming
into
his
eyes
losing
a
ship
is
nothing
to
me
i
ve
lost
ships
before
and
it
doesn
t
bother
me
in
the
least
when
i
set
out
to
go
to
a
place
i
get
there
do
you
understand
i
may
know
nothing
whatever
about
sailing
and
navigation
but
i
get
there
just
the
same
now
you
may
be
the
best
seaman
in
the
world
but
on
ship
you
re
just
a
plain
ordinary
plain
and
very
ordinary
and
i
am
now
going
to
call
at
the
nearest
port
and
put
you
yes
and
think
yourself
lucky
polynesia
put
in
that
you
are
not
locked
up
for
stowing
away
and
eating
all
our
salt
i
don
t
know
what
the
mischief
we
re
going
to
do
now
i
heard
her
whisper
to
bumpo
we
ve
no
money
to
buy
any
more
and
that
salt
beef
was
the
most
important
part
of
the
would
it
not
be
good
political
economy
bumpo
whispered
back
if
we
salted
the
able
seaman
and
ate
him
instead
i
should
judge
that
he
would
weigh
more
than
a
hundred
and
twenty
how
often
must
i
tell
you
that
we
are
not
in
jolliginki
snapped
polynesia
those
things
are
not
done
on
white
men
s
she
murmured
after
a
moment
s
thought
it
s
an
awfully
bright
idea
i
don
t
suppose
anybody
saw
him
come
on
to
the
but
heavens
we
haven
t
got
enough
salt
besides
he
d
be
sure
to
taste
of
fifth
polynesia
has
a
plan
then
the
doctor
told
me
to
take
the
wheel
while
he
made
a
little
calculation
with
his
map
and
worked
out
what
new
course
we
should
take
i
shall
have
to
run
for
the
capa
blancas
after
all
he
told
me
when
the
seaman
s
back
was
turned
dreadful
nuisance
but
i
d
sooner
swim
back
to
puddleby
than
have
to
listen
to
that
fellow
s
talk
all
the
way
to
indeed
he
was
a
terrible
person
this
ben
butcher
you
d
think
that
any
one
after
being
told
he
wasn
t
wanted
would
have
had
the
decency
to
keep
quiet
but
not
ben
butcher
he
kept
going
round
the
deck
pointing
out
all
the
things
we
had
wrong
according
to
him
there
wasn
t
a
thing
right
on
the
whole
ship
the
anchor
was
hitched
up
wrong
the
hatches
weren
t
fastened
down
properly
the
sails
were
put
on
back
to
front
all
our
knots
were
the
wrong
kind
of
knots
at
last
the
doctor
told
him
to
stop
talking
and
go
downstairs
he
he
wasn
t
going
to
be
sunk
by
landlubbers
while
he
was
still
able
to
stay
on
deck
this
made
us
feel
a
little
uneasy
he
was
such
an
enormous
man
there
was
no
knowing
what
he
might
do
if
he
got
really
obstreperous
bumpo
and
i
were
talking
about
this
downstairs
in
the
when
polynesia
jip
and
came
and
joined
us
and
as
usual
polynesia
had
a
plan
listen
she
said
i
am
certain
this
ben
butcher
is
a
smuggler
and
a
bad
man
i
am
a
very
good
judge
of
seamen
remember
and
i
don
t
like
the
cut
of
this
man
s
jib
do
you
really
think
i
interrupted
that
it
safe
for
the
doctor
to
cross
the
atlantic
without
any
regular
seamen
on
his
ship
you
see
it
had
upset
me
quite
a
good
deal
to
find
that
all
the
things
we
had
been
doing
were
wrong
and
i
was
beginning
to
wonder
what
might
happen
if
we
ran
into
a
as
miranda
had
only
said
the
weather
would
be
good
for
a
certain
time
and
we
seemed
to
be
having
so
many
delays
but
polynesia
merely
tossed
her
head
scornfully
oh
bless
you
my
boy
said
she
you
re
always
safe
with
john
dolittle
remember
that
don
t
take
any
notice
of
that
stupid
old
salt
of
course
it
is
perfectly
true
the
doctor
does
do
everything
wrong
but
with
him
it
doesn
t
matter
mark
my
words
if
you
travel
with
john
dolittle
you
always
get
there
as
you
heard
him
say
i
ve
been
with
him
lots
of
times
and
i
know
sometimes
the
ship
is
upside
down
when
you
get
there
and
sometimes
it
s
right
way
up
but
you
get
there
just
the
same
and
then
of
course
there
s
another
thing
about
the
doctor
she
added
thoughtfully
he
always
has
extraordinary
good
luck
he
may
have
his
troubles
but
with
him
things
seem
to
have
a
habit
of
turning
out
all
right
in
the
end
i
remember
once
when
we
were
going
through
the
straits
of
magellan
the
wind
was
so
but
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
ben
butcher
jip
put
in
you
had
some
plan
polynesia
hadn
t
you
yes
what
i
m
afraid
of
is
that
he
may
hit
the
doctor
on
the
head
when
he
s
not
looking
and
make
himself
captain
of
the
bad
sailors
do
that
sometimes
then
they
run
the
ship
their
own
way
and
take
it
where
they
want
that
s
what
you
call
a
yes
said
jip
and
we
ought
to
do
something
pretty
quick
we
can
t
reach
the
capa
blancas
before
the
day
after
at
best
i
don
t
like
to
leave
the
doctor
alone
with
him
for
a
minute
he
smells
like
a
very
bad
man
to
well
i
ve
got
it
all
worked
out
said
polynesia
listen
is
there
a
key
in
that
door
we
looked
outside
the
and
found
that
there
was
all
right
said
polynesia
now
bumpo
lays
the
table
for
lunch
and
we
all
go
and
hide
then
at
twelve
o
clock
bumpo
rings
the
down
here
as
soon
as
ben
hears
it
he
ll
come
down
expecting
more
salt
beef
bumpo
must
hide
behind
the
door
outside
the
moment
that
ben
is
seated
at
the
bumpo
slams
the
door
and
locks
it
then
we
ve
got
him
see
how
stratagenious
bumpo
chuckled
as
cicero
said
cum
parishioners
facilime
i
ll
lay
the
table
at
yes
and
take
that
worcestershire
sauce
off
the
dresser
with
you
when
you
go
out
said
polynesia
don
t
leave
any
loose
eatables
around
that
fellow
has
had
enough
to
last
any
man
for
three
days
besides
he
won
t
be
so
inclined
to
start
a
fight
when
we
put
him
ashore
at
the
capa
blancas
if
we
thin
him
down
a
bit
before
we
let
him
so
we
all
went
and
hid
ourselves
in
the
passage
where
we
could
watch
what
happened
and
presently
bumpo
came
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
rang
the
like
mad
then
he
hopped
behind
the
door
and
we
all
kept
still
and
listened
almost
immediately
down
the
stairs
tramped
ben
butcher
the
able
seaman
he
walked
into
the
sat
himself
down
at
the
head
of
the
table
in
the
doctor
s
place
tucked
a
napkin
under
his
fat
chin
and
heaved
a
sigh
of
expectation
then
bumpo
slammed
the
door
and
locked
it
that
settles
for
a
while
said
polynesia
coming
out
from
her
now
let
him
teach
navigation
to
the
gosh
the
cheek
of
the
man
i
ve
forgotten
more
about
the
sea
than
that
lumbering
lout
will
ever
know
let
s
go
upstairs
and
tell
the
doctor
bumpo
you
will
have
to
serve
the
meals
in
the
cabin
for
the
next
couple
of
and
bursting
into
a
rollicking
norwegian
she
climbed
up
to
my
shoulder
and
we
went
on
deck
sixth
the
of
monteverde
we
remained
three
days
in
the
capa
blanca
islands
there
were
two
reasons
why
we
stayed
there
so
long
when
we
were
really
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
away
one
was
the
shortage
in
our
provisions
caused
by
the
able
seaman
s
enormous
appetite
when
we
came
to
go
over
the
stores
and
make
a
list
we
found
that
he
had
eaten
a
whole
lot
of
other
things
besides
the
beef
and
having
no
money
we
were
sorely
puzzled
how
to
buy
more
the
doctor
went
through
his
trunk
to
see
if
there
was
anything
he
could
sell
but
the
only
thing
he
could
find
was
an
old
watch
with
the
hands
broken
and
the
back
dented
in
and
we
decided
this
would
not
bring
us
in
enough
money
to
buy
much
more
than
a
pound
of
tea
bumpo
suggested
that
he
sing
comic
songs
in
the
streets
which
he
had
learned
in
jolliginki
but
the
doctor
said
he
did
not
think
that
the
islanders
would
care
for
african
music
the
other
thing
that
kept
us
was
the
bullfight
in
these
islands
which
belonged
to
spain
they
had
bullfights
every
sunday
it
was
on
a
friday
that
we
arrived
there
and
after
we
had
got
rid
of
the
able
seaman
we
took
a
walk
through
the
town
it
was
a
very
funny
little
town
quite
different
from
any
that
i
had
ever
seen
the
streets
were
all
twisty
and
winding
and
so
narrow
that
a
wagon
could
only
just
pass
along
them
the
houses
at
the
top
and
came
so
close
together
that
people
in
the
attics
could
lean
out
of
the
windows
and
shake
hands
with
their
neighbors
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
the
doctor
told
us
the
town
was
very
very
old
it
was
called
monteverde
as
we
had
no
money
of
course
we
did
not
go
to
a
hotel
or
anything
like
that
but
on
the
second
evening
when
we
were
passing
by
a
s
shop
we
noticed
several
beds
which
the
man
had
made
standing
on
the
pavement
outside
the
doctor
started
chatting
in
spanish
to
the
who
was
sitting
at
his
door
whistling
to
a
parrot
in
a
cage
the
doctor
and
the
got
very
friendly
talking
about
birds
and
things
and
as
it
grew
near
to
the
man
asked
us
to
stop
and
sup
with
him
this
of
course
we
were
very
glad
to
do
and
after
the
meal
was
over
very
nice
dishes
they
were
mostly
cooked
in
particularly
liked
the
fried
bananas
we
sat
outside
on
the
pavement
again
and
went
on
talking
far
into
the
night
at
last
when
we
got
up
to
go
back
to
our
ship
this
very
nice
shopkeeper
wouldn
t
hear
of
our
going
away
on
any
account
he
said
the
streets
down
by
the
harbor
were
very
badly
lighted
and
there
was
no
moon
we
would
surely
get
lost
he
invited
us
to
spend
the
night
with
him
and
go
back
to
our
ship
in
the
morning
well
we
finally
agreed
and
as
our
good
friend
had
no
spare
bedrooms
the
three
of
us
the
doctor
bumpo
and
i
slept
on
the
beds
set
out
for
sale
on
the
pavement
before
the
shop
the
night
was
so
hot
we
needed
no
coverings
it
was
great
fun
to
fall
asleep
out
of
doors
like
this
watching
the
people
walking
to
and
fro
and
the
gay
life
of
the
streets
it
seemed
to
me
that
spanish
people
never
went
to
bed
at
all
late
as
it
was
all
the
little
restaurants
and
cafés
around
us
were
wide
open
with
customers
drinking
coffee
and
chatting
merrily
at
the
small
tables
outside
the
sound
of
a
guitar
strumming
softly
in
the
distance
mingled
with
the
clatter
of
chinaware
and
the
babble
of
voices
somehow
it
made
me
think
of
my
mother
and
father
far
away
in
puddleby
with
their
regular
habits
the
evening
practise
on
the
flute
and
the
the
same
thing
every
day
i
felt
sort
of
sorry
for
them
in
a
way
because
they
missed
the
fun
of
this
traveling
life
where
we
were
doing
something
new
all
the
sleeping
differently
but
i
suppose
if
they
had
been
invited
to
go
to
bed
on
a
pavement
in
front
of
a
shop
they
wouldn
t
have
cared
for
the
idea
at
all
it
is
funny
how
some
people
are
illustration
the
doctor
started
chatting
in
spanish
to
the
seventh
the
doctor
s
wager
next
morning
we
were
awakened
by
a
great
racket
there
was
a
procession
coming
down
the
street
a
number
of
men
in
very
gay
clothes
followed
by
a
large
crowd
of
admiring
ladies
and
cheering
children
i
asked
the
doctor
who
they
were
they
are
the
bullfighters
he
said
there
is
to
be
a
bullfight
what
is
a
bullfight
i
asked
to
my
great
surprise
the
doctor
got
red
in
the
face
with
anger
it
reminded
me
of
the
time
when
he
had
spoken
of
the
lions
and
tigers
in
his
private
zoo
a
bullfight
is
a
stupid
cruel
disgusting
business
said
he
these
spanish
people
are
most
lovable
and
hospitable
folk
how
they
can
enjoy
these
wretched
bullfights
is
a
thing
i
could
never
then
the
doctor
went
on
to
explain
to
me
how
a
bull
was
first
made
very
angry
by
teasing
and
then
allowed
to
run
into
a
circus
where
men
came
out
with
red
cloaks
waved
them
at
him
and
ran
away
next
the
bull
was
allowed
to
tire
himself
out
by
tossing
and
killing
a
lot
of
poor
old
horses
who
couldn
t
defend
themselves
then
when
the
bull
was
thoroughly
out
of
breath
and
wearied
by
this
a
man
came
out
with
a
sword
and
killed
the
bull
every
sunday
said
the
doctor
in
almost
every
big
town
in
spain
there
are
six
bulls
killed
like
that
and
as
many
but
aren
t
the
men
ever
killed
by
the
bull
i
asked
unfortunately
very
seldom
said
he
a
bull
is
not
nearly
as
dangerous
as
he
looks
even
when
he
s
angry
if
you
are
only
quick
on
your
feet
and
don
t
lose
your
head
these
bullfighters
are
very
clever
and
nimble
and
the
people
especially
the
spanish
ladies
think
no
end
of
them
a
famous
bullfighter
or
matador
as
they
call
them
is
a
more
important
man
in
spain
than
a
comes
another
crowd
of
them
round
the
corner
look
see
the
girls
throwing
kisses
to
them
ridiculous
business
at
that
moment
our
friend
the
came
out
to
see
the
procession
go
past
and
while
he
was
wishing
us
good
morning
and
enquiring
how
we
had
slept
a
friend
of
his
walked
up
and
joined
us
the
introduced
this
friend
to
us
as
don
enrique
cardenas
don
enrique
when
he
heard
where
we
were
from
spoke
to
us
in
english
he
appeared
to
be
a
gentlemanly
sort
of
person
and
you
go
to
see
the
bullfight
yes
he
asked
the
doctor
pleasantly
certainly
not
said
john
dolittle
firmly
i
don
t
like
cowardly
don
enrique
nearly
exploded
i
never
saw
a
man
get
so
excited
he
told
the
doctor
that
he
didn
t
know
what
he
was
talking
about
he
said
bullfighting
was
a
noble
sport
and
that
the
matadors
were
the
bravest
men
in
the
world
oh
rubbish
said
the
doctor
you
never
give
the
poor
bull
a
chance
it
is
only
when
he
is
all
tired
and
dazed
that
your
precious
matadors
dare
to
try
and
kill
i
thought
the
spaniard
was
going
to
strike
the
doctor
he
got
so
angry
while
he
was
still
spluttering
to
find
words
the
came
between
them
and
took
the
doctor
aside
he
explained
to
john
dolittle
in
a
whisper
that
this
don
enrique
cardenas
was
a
very
important
person
that
he
it
was
who
supplied
the
special
strong
black
his
own
farm
for
all
the
bullfights
in
the
capa
blancas
he
was
a
very
rich
man
the
said
a
most
important
personage
he
mustn
t
be
allowed
to
take
offense
on
any
account
i
watched
the
doctor
s
face
as
the
finished
and
i
saw
a
flash
of
boyish
mischief
come
into
his
eyes
as
though
an
idea
had
struck
him
he
turned
to
the
angry
spaniard
don
enrique
he
said
you
tell
me
your
bullfighters
are
very
brave
men
and
skilful
it
seems
i
have
offended
you
by
saying
that
bullfighting
is
a
poor
sport
what
is
the
name
of
the
best
matador
you
have
for
s
show
pepito
de
malaga
said
don
enrique
one
of
the
greatest
names
one
of
the
bravest
men
in
all
very
well
said
the
doctor
i
have
a
proposal
to
make
to
you
i
have
never
fought
a
bull
in
my
life
now
supposing
i
were
to
go
into
the
ring
with
pepito
de
malaga
and
any
other
matadors
you
choose
and
if
i
can
do
more
tricks
with
a
bull
than
they
can
would
you
promise
to
do
something
for
me
don
enrique
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
man
he
said
you
must
be
mad
you
would
be
killed
at
once
one
has
to
be
trained
for
years
to
become
a
proper
supposing
i
were
willing
to
take
the
risk
of
are
not
afraid
i
take
it
to
accept
my
offer
the
spaniard
frowned
afraid
he
cried
sir
if
you
can
beat
pepito
de
malaga
in
the
i
ll
promise
you
anything
it
is
possible
for
me
to
very
good
said
the
doctor
now
i
understand
that
you
are
quite
a
powerful
man
in
these
islands
if
you
wished
to
stop
all
bullfighting
here
after
you
could
do
it
couldn
t
you
yes
said
don
enrique
i
well
that
is
what
i
ask
of
i
win
my
wager
said
john
dolittle
if
i
can
do
more
with
angry
bulls
than
can
pepito
de
malaga
you
are
to
promise
me
that
there
shall
never
be
another
bullfight
in
the
capa
blancas
so
long
as
you
are
alive
to
stop
it
is
it
a
bargain
the
spaniard
held
out
his
hand
it
is
a
bargain
he
i
promise
but
i
must
warn
you
that
you
are
merely
throwing
your
life
away
for
you
will
certainly
be
killed
however
that
is
no
more
than
you
deserve
for
saying
that
bullfighting
is
an
unworthy
sport
i
will
meet
you
here
morning
if
you
should
wish
to
arrange
any
particulars
good
day
as
the
spaniard
turned
and
walked
into
the
shop
with
the
polynesia
who
had
been
listening
as
usual
flew
up
on
to
my
shoulder
and
whispered
in
my
ear
i
have
a
plan
get
hold
of
bumpo
and
come
some
place
where
the
doctor
can
t
hear
us
i
want
to
talk
to
i
nudged
bumpo
s
elbow
and
we
crossed
the
street
and
pretended
to
look
into
a
jeweler
s
window
while
the
doctor
sat
down
upon
his
bed
to
lace
up
his
boots
the
only
part
of
his
clothing
he
had
taken
off
for
the
night
listen
said
polynesia
i
ve
been
breaking
my
head
trying
to
think
up
some
way
we
can
get
money
to
buy
those
stores
with
and
at
last
i
ve
got
the
money
said
bumpo
no
stupid
the
make
the
money
with
listen
the
doctor
is
simply
bound
to
win
this
game
sure
as
you
re
alive
now
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
make
a
side
bet
with
these
re
great
on
the
trick
s
what
s
a
side
bet
i
asked
oh
i
know
what
that
is
said
bumpo
proudly
we
used
to
have
lots
of
them
at
oxford
when
was
on
i
go
to
don
enrique
and
say
i
bet
you
a
hundred
pounds
the
doctor
then
if
he
does
win
don
enrique
pays
me
a
hundred
pounds
and
if
he
doesn
t
i
have
to
pay
don
that
s
the
idea
said
polynesia
only
don
t
say
a
hundred
pounds
say
pesetas
now
come
and
find
old
don
and
try
to
look
so
we
crossed
the
street
again
and
slipped
into
the
s
shop
while
the
doctor
was
still
busy
with
his
boots
don
enrique
said
bumpo
allow
me
to
introduce
myself
i
am
the
crown
prince
of
jolliginki
would
you
care
to
have
a
small
bet
with
me
on
s
bullfight
don
enrique
bowed
why
certainly
he
said
i
shall
be
delighted
but
i
must
warn
you
that
you
are
bound
to
lose
how
much
oh
a
mere
truffle
said
just
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
you
know
what
do
you
say
to
pesetas
i
agree
said
the
spaniard
bowing
once
more
i
will
meet
you
after
the
bullfight
so
that
s
all
right
said
polynesia
as
we
came
out
to
join
the
doctor
i
feel
as
though
quite
a
load
had
been
taken
off
my
eighth
the
great
bullfight
the
next
day
was
a
great
day
in
monteverde
all
the
streets
were
hung
with
flags
and
everywhere
gaily
dressed
crowds
were
to
be
seen
flocking
towards
the
as
the
big
circus
was
called
where
the
fights
took
place
the
news
of
the
doctor
s
challenge
had
gone
round
the
town
and
it
seemed
had
caused
much
amusement
to
the
islanders
the
very
idea
of
a
mere
foreigner
daring
to
match
himself
against
the
great
pepito
de
malaga
him
right
if
he
got
killed
the
doctor
had
borrowed
a
bullfighter
s
suit
from
don
enrique
and
very
gay
and
wonderful
he
looked
in
it
though
bumpo
and
i
had
hard
work
getting
the
waistcoat
to
close
in
front
and
even
then
the
buttons
kept
bursting
off
it
in
all
directions
when
we
set
out
from
the
harbor
to
walk
to
the
crowds
of
small
boys
ran
after
us
making
fun
of
the
doctor
s
fatness
calling
out
hagapoco
el
grueso
matador
which
is
the
spanish
for
john
dolittle
the
fat
as
soon
as
we
arrived
the
doctor
said
he
would
like
to
take
a
look
at
the
bulls
before
the
fight
began
and
we
were
at
once
led
to
the
bull
pen
where
behind
a
high
railing
six
enormous
black
bulls
were
tramping
around
wildly
in
a
few
hurried
words
and
signs
the
doctor
told
the
bulls
what
he
was
going
to
do
and
gave
them
careful
instructions
for
their
part
of
the
show
the
poor
creatures
were
tremendously
glad
when
they
heard
that
there
was
a
chance
of
bullfighting
being
stopped
and
they
promised
to
do
exactly
as
they
were
told
of
course
the
man
who
took
us
in
there
didn
t
understand
what
we
were
doing
he
merely
thought
the
fat
englishman
was
crazy
when
he
saw
the
doctor
making
signs
and
talking
in
ox
tongue
from
there
the
doctor
went
to
the
matadors
while
bumpo
and
i
with
polynesia
made
our
way
into
the
and
took
our
seats
in
the
great
theatre
it
was
a
very
gay
sight
thousands
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
were
there
all
dressed
in
their
smartest
clothes
and
everybody
seemed
very
happy
and
cheerful
right
at
the
beginning
don
enrique
got
up
and
explained
to
the
people
that
the
first
item
on
the
program
was
to
be
a
match
between
the
english
doctor
and
pepito
de
malaga
he
told
them
what
he
had
promised
if
the
doctor
should
win
but
the
people
did
not
seem
to
think
there
was
much
chance
of
that
a
roar
of
laughter
went
up
at
the
very
mention
of
such
a
thing
when
pepito
came
into
the
ring
everybody
cheered
the
ladies
blew
kisses
and
the
men
clapped
and
waved
their
hats
presently
a
large
door
on
the
other
side
of
the
ring
was
rolled
back
and
in
galloped
one
of
the
bulls
then
the
door
was
closed
again
at
once
the
matador
became
very
much
on
the
alert
he
waved
his
red
cloak
and
the
bull
rushed
at
him
pepito
stepped
nimbly
aside
and
the
people
cheered
again
this
game
was
repeated
several
times
but
i
noticed
that
whenever
pepito
got
into
a
tight
place
and
seemed
to
be
in
real
danger
from
the
bull
an
assistant
of
his
who
always
hung
around
somewhere
near
drew
the
bull
s
attention
upon
himself
by
waving
another
red
cloak
then
the
bull
would
chase
the
assistant
and
pepito
was
left
in
safety
most
often
as
soon
as
he
had
drawn
the
bull
off
this
assistant
ran
for
the
high
fence
and
vaulted
out
of
the
ring
to
save
himself
they
evidently
had
it
all
arranged
these
matadors
and
it
didn
t
seem
to
me
that
they
were
in
any
very
great
danger
from
the
poor
clumsy
bull
so
long
as
they
didn
t
slip
and
fall
after
about
ten
minutes
of
this
kind
of
thing
the
small
door
into
the
matadors
opened
and
the
doctor
strolled
into
the
ring
as
soon
as
his
fat
figure
dressed
in
velvet
appeared
the
crowd
rocked
in
their
seats
with
laughter
juan
hagapoco
as
they
had
called
him
walked
out
into
the
centre
of
the
ring
and
bowed
ceremoniously
to
the
ladies
in
the
boxes
then
he
bowed
to
the
bull
then
he
bowed
to
pepito
while
he
was
bowing
to
pepito
s
assistant
the
bull
started
to
rush
at
him
from
behind
look
out
look
out
bull
you
will
be
killed
yelled
the
crowd
but
the
doctor
calmly
finished
his
bow
then
turning
round
he
folded
his
arms
fixed
the
bull
with
his
eye
and
frowned
a
terrible
frown
presently
a
curious
thing
happened
the
bull
s
speed
got
slower
and
slower
it
almost
looked
as
though
he
were
afraid
of
that
frown
soon
he
stopped
altogether
the
doctor
shook
his
finger
at
him
he
began
to
tremble
at
last
tucking
his
tail
between
his
legs
the
bull
turned
round
and
ran
away
the
crowd
gasped
the
doctor
ran
after
him
round
and
round
the
ring
they
went
both
of
them
puffing
and
blowing
like
grampuses
excited
whispers
began
to
break
out
among
the
people
this
was
something
new
in
bullfighting
to
have
the
bull
running
away
from
the
man
instead
of
the
man
away
from
the
bull
at
last
in
the
tenth
lap
with
a
final
burst
of
speed
juan
hagapoco
the
english
matador
caught
the
poor
bull
by
the
tail
then
leading
the
now
timid
creature
into
the
middle
of
the
ring
the
doctor
made
him
do
all
manner
of
tricks
standing
on
the
hind
legs
standing
on
the
front
legs
dancing
hopping
rolling
over
he
finished
up
by
making
the
bull
kneel
down
then
he
got
on
to
his
back
and
did
handsprings
and
other
acrobatics
on
the
beast
s
horns
pepito
and
his
assistant
had
their
noses
sadly
out
of
joint
the
crowd
had
forgotten
them
entirely
they
were
standing
together
by
the
fence
not
far
from
where
i
sat
muttering
to
one
another
and
slowly
growing
green
with
jealousy
finally
the
doctor
turned
towards
don
enrique
s
seat
and
bowing
said
in
a
loud
voice
this
bull
is
no
good
any
more
he
s
terrified
and
out
of
breath
take
him
away
does
the
caballero
wish
for
a
fresh
bull
asked
don
enrique
no
said
the
doctor
i
want
five
fresh
bulls
and
i
would
like
them
all
in
the
ring
at
once
at
this
a
cry
of
horror
burst
from
the
people
they
had
been
used
to
seeing
matadors
escaping
from
one
bull
at
a
time
but
must
mean
certain
death
pepito
sprang
forward
and
called
to
don
enrique
not
to
allow
it
saying
it
was
against
all
the
rules
of
bullfighting
ha
polynesia
chuckled
into
my
ear
it
s
like
the
doctor
s
navigation
he
breaks
all
the
rules
but
he
gets
there
if
they
ll
only
let
him
he
ll
give
them
the
best
show
for
their
money
they
ever
a
great
argument
began
half
the
people
seemed
to
be
on
pepito
s
side
and
half
on
the
doctor
s
side
at
last
the
doctor
turned
to
pepito
and
made
another
very
grand
bow
which
burst
the
last
button
off
his
waistcoat
illustration
did
acrobatics
on
the
beast
s
horns
well
of
course
if
the
caballero
is
he
began
with
a
bland
smile
afraid
screamed
pepito
i
am
afraid
of
nothing
on
earth
i
am
the
greatest
matador
in
spain
with
this
right
hand
i
have
killed
nine
hundred
and
all
right
then
said
the
doctor
let
us
see
if
you
can
kill
five
more
let
the
bulls
in
he
shouted
pepito
de
malaga
is
not
a
dreadful
silence
hung
over
the
great
theatre
as
the
heavy
door
into
the
bull
pen
was
rolled
back
then
with
a
roar
the
five
big
bulls
bounded
into
the
ring
look
fierce
i
heard
the
doctor
call
to
them
in
cattle
language
don
t
scatter
keep
close
get
ready
for
a
rush
take
pepito
the
one
in
purple
first
but
for
heaven
s
sake
don
t
kill
him
just
chase
him
out
of
the
then
all
together
go
for
him
the
bulls
put
down
their
heads
and
all
in
line
like
a
squadron
of
cavalry
charged
across
the
ring
straight
for
poor
pepito
for
one
moment
the
spaniard
tried
his
hardest
to
look
brave
but
the
sight
of
the
five
pairs
of
horns
coming
at
him
at
full
gallop
was
too
much
he
turned
white
to
the
lips
ran
for
the
fence
vaulted
it
and
disappeared
now
the
other
one
the
doctor
hissed
and
in
two
seconds
the
gallant
assistant
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
juan
hagapoco
the
fat
matador
was
left
alone
in
the
ring
with
five
rampaging
bulls
the
rest
of
the
show
was
really
well
worth
seeing
first
all
five
bulls
went
raging
round
the
ring
butting
at
the
fence
with
their
horns
pawing
up
the
sand
hunting
for
something
to
kill
then
each
one
in
turn
would
pretend
to
catch
sight
of
the
doctor
for
the
first
time
and
giving
a
bellow
of
rage
would
lower
his
wicked
looking
horns
and
shoot
like
an
arrow
across
the
ring
as
though
he
meant
to
toss
him
to
the
sky
it
was
really
frightfully
exciting
and
even
i
who
knew
it
was
all
arranged
beforehand
held
my
breath
in
terror
for
the
doctor
s
life
when
i
saw
how
near
they
came
to
sticking
him
but
just
at
the
last
moment
when
the
horns
points
were
two
inches
from
the
waistcoat
the
doctor
would
spring
nimbly
to
one
side
and
the
great
brutes
would
go
thundering
harmlessly
by
missing
him
by
no
more
than
a
hair
then
all
five
of
them
went
for
him
together
completely
surrounding
him
slashing
at
him
with
their
horns
and
bellowing
with
fury
how
he
escaped
alive
i
don
t
know
for
several
minutes
his
round
figure
could
hardly
be
seen
at
all
in
that
scrimmage
of
tossing
heads
stamping
hoofs
and
waving
was
as
polynesia
had
prophesied
the
greatest
bullfight
ever
seen
one
woman
in
the
crowd
got
quite
hysterical
and
screamed
up
to
don
enrique
stop
the
fight
stop
the
fight
he
is
too
brave
a
man
to
be
killed
this
is
the
most
wonderful
matador
in
the
world
let
him
live
stop
the
fight
but
presently
the
doctor
was
seen
to
break
loose
from
the
mob
of
animals
that
surrounded
him
then
catching
each
of
them
by
the
horns
one
after
another
he
would
give
their
heads
a
sudden
twist
and
throw
them
down
flat
on
the
sand
the
great
fellows
acted
their
parts
extremely
well
i
have
never
seen
trained
animals
in
a
circus
do
better
they
lay
there
panting
on
the
ground
where
the
doctor
threw
them
as
if
they
were
exhausted
and
completely
beaten
then
with
a
final
bow
to
the
ladies
john
dolittle
took
a
cigar
from
his
pocket
lit
it
and
strolled
out
of
the
ring
ninth
we
depart
in
a
hurry
as
soon
as
the
door
closed
behind
the
doctor
the
most
tremendous
noise
i
have
ever
heard
broke
loose
some
of
the
men
appeared
to
be
angry
friends
of
pepito
s
i
suppose
but
the
ladies
called
and
called
to
have
the
doctor
come
back
into
the
ring
when
at
length
he
did
so
the
women
seemed
to
go
entirely
mad
over
him
they
blew
kisses
to
him
they
called
him
a
darling
then
they
started
taking
off
their
flowers
their
rings
their
necklaces
and
their
brooches
and
threw
them
down
at
his
feet
you
never
saw
anything
like
perfect
shower
of
jewelry
and
roses
but
the
doctor
just
smiled
up
at
them
bowed
once
more
and
backed
out
now
bumpo
said
polynesia
this
is
where
you
go
down
and
gather
up
all
those
trinkets
and
we
ll
sell
em
that
s
what
the
big
matadors
do
leave
the
jewelry
on
the
ground
and
their
assistants
collect
it
for
them
we
might
as
well
lay
in
a
good
supply
of
money
while
we
ve
got
the
never
know
when
you
may
need
it
when
you
re
traveling
with
the
doctor

that
jew
s
shop
opposite
the
s
run
not
a
word
to
the
doctor
outside
the
we
found
the
crowd
still
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
violent
arguments
were
going
on
everywhere
bumpo
joined
us
with
his
pockets
bulging
in
all
directions
and
we
made
our
way
slowly
through
the
dense
crowd
to
that
side
of
the
building
where
the
matadors
was
the
doctor

waiting
at
the
door

better
get
back
to
the
ship
now
as
quick
and
as
quietly
as
you
can
put
your
overcoat
on
over
that
giddy
suit
i
don
t
like
the
looks
of
this
crowd
more
than
half
of
them
are
furious
because
you
ve
won
don
must
now
stop
the
you
know
how
they
love
it
what
i
m
afraid
of
is
that
some
of
these
matadors
who
are
just
mad
with
jealousy
may
start
some
dirty
work
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
time
for
us
to
get
i
dare
say
you
re
right
polynesia
said
the
you
usually
are
the
crowd
does
seem
to
be
a
bit
restless
i
ll
slip
down
to
the
ship
i
shan
t
be
so
noticeable
and
i
ll
wait
for
you
there
you
come
by
some
different
way
but
don
t
be
long
about
it
hurry
as
soon
as
the
doctor
had
departed
bumpo
sought
out
don
enrique
and
said
honorable
sir
you
owe
me
without
a
word
but
looking
with
annoyance
don
enrique
paid
his
bet
we
next
set
out
to
buy
the
provisions
and
on
the
way
we
hired
a
cab
and
took
it
along
with
us
not
very
far
away
we
found
a
big
grocer
s
shop
which
seemed
to
sell
everything
to
eat
we
went
in
and
bought
up
the
finest
lot
of
food
you
ever
saw
in
your
life
as
a
matter
of
fact
polynesia
had
been
right
about
the
danger
we
were
in
the
news
of
our
victory
must
have
spread
like
lightning
through
the
whole
town
for
as
we
came
out
of
the
shop
and
loaded
the
cab
up
with
our
stores
we
saw
various
little
knots
of
angry
men
hunting
round
the
streets
waving
sticks
and
shouting
the
englishmen
where
are
those
accursed
englishmen
who
stopped
the
bullfighting
them
to
a
them
in
the
sea
the
englishmen
want
the
englishmen
after
that
we
didn
t
waste
any
time
you
may
be
sure
bumpo
grabbed
the
spanish
and
explained
to
him
in
signs
that
if
he
didn
t
drive
down
to
the
harbor
as
fast
as
he
knew
how
and
keep
his
mouth
shut
the
whole
way
he
would
choke
the
life
out
of
him
then
we
jumped
into
the
cab
on
top
of
the
food
slammed
the
door
pulled
down
the
blinds
and
away
we
went
we
won
t
get
a
chance
to
pawn
the
jewelry
now
said
polynesia
as
we
bumped
over
the
cobbly
streets
but
never
may
come
in
handy
later
on
and
anyway
we
ve
got
pesetas
left
out
of
the
bet
don
t
give
the
cabby
more
than
two
pesetas
fifty
bumpo
that
s
the
right
fare
i
well
we
reached
the
harbor
all
right
and
we
were
mighty
glad
to
find
that
the
doctor
had
sent
back
with
the
to
wait
for
us
at
the
unfortunately
while
we
were
in
the
middle
of
loading
the
supplies
from
the
cab
into
the
boat
the
angry
mob
arrived
upon
the
wharf
and
made
a
rush
for
us
bumpo
snatched
up
a
big
beam
of
wood
that
lay
near
and
swung
it
round
and
round
his
head
letting
out
dreadful
african
the
while
this
kept
the
crowd
off
while
and
i
hustled
the
last
of
the
stores
into
the
boat
and
clambered
in
ourselves
bumpo
threw
his
beam
of
wood
into
the
thick
of
the
spaniards
and
leapt
in
after
us
then
we
pushed
off
and
rowed
like
mad
for
the
the
mob
upon
the
wall
howled
with
rage
shook
their
fists
and
hurled
stones
and
all
manner
of
things
after
us
poor
old
bumpo
got
hit
on
the
head
with
a
bottle
but
as
he
had
a
very
strong
head
it
only
raised
a
small
bump
while
the
bottle
smashed
into
a
thousand
pieces
when
we
reached
the
ship
s
side
the
doctor
had
the
anchor
drawn
up
and
the
sails
set
and
everything
in
readiness
to
get
away
looking
back
we
saw
boats
coming
out
from
the
after
us
filled
with
angry
shouting
men
so
we
didn
t
bother
to
unload
our
rowboat
but
just
tied
it
on
to
the
ship
s
stern
with
a
rope
and
jumped
aboard
it
only
took
a
moment
more
to
swing
the
round
into
the
wind
and
soon
we
were
speeding
out
of
the
harbor
on
our
way
to
brazil
ha
sighed
polynesia
as
we
all
flopped
down
on
the
deck
to
take
a
rest
and
get
our
breath
that
wasn
t
a
bad
reminds
me
of
my
old
seafaring
days
when
i
sailed
with
the
that
was
the
life
mind
your
head
bumpo
it
will
be
all
right
when
the
doctor
puts
a
little
arnica
on
it
think
what
we
got
out
of
the
scrap
a
of
ship
s
stores
pockets
full
of
jewelry
and
thousands
of
pesetas
not
bad
you
illustration
part
four
first
shellfish
languages
again
miranda
the
purple
had
prophesied
rightly
when
she
had
foretold
a
good
spell
of
weather
for
three
weeks
the
good
ship
plowed
her
way
through
smiling
seas
before
a
steady
powerful
wind
i
suppose
most
real
sailors
would
have
found
this
part
of
the
voyage
dull
but
not
i
as
we
got
further
south
and
further
west
the
face
of
the
sea
seemed
different
every
day
and
all
the
little
things
of
a
voyage
which
an
old
hand
would
have
hardly
bothered
to
notice
were
matters
of
great
interest
for
my
eager
eyes
we
did
not
pass
many
ships
when
we
did
see
one
the
doctor
would
get
out
his
telescope
and
we
would
all
take
a
look
at
it
sometimes
he
would
signal
to
it
asking
for
news
by
hauling
up
little
colored
flags
upon
the
mast
and
the
ship
would
signal
back
to
us
in
the
same
way
the
meaning
of
all
the
signals
was
printed
in
a
book
which
the
doctor
kept
in
the
cabin
he
told
me
it
was
the
language
of
the
sea
and
that
all
ships
could
understand
it
whether
they
be
english
dutch
or
french
our
greatest
happening
during
those
first
weeks
was
passing
an
iceberg
when
the
sun
shone
on
it
it
burst
into
a
hundred
colors
sparkling
like
a
jeweled
palace
in
a
through
the
telescope
we
saw
a
mother
polar
bear
with
a
cub
sitting
on
it
watching
us
the
doctor
recognized
her
as
one
of
the
bears
who
had
spoken
to
him
when
he
was
discovering
the
north
pole
so
he
sailed
the
ship
up
close
and
offered
to
take
her
and
her
baby
on
to
the
if
she
wished
it
but
she
only
shook
her
head
thanking
him
she
said
it
would
be
far
too
hot
for
the
cub
on
the
deck
of
our
ship
with
no
ice
to
keep
his
feet
cool
it
had
been
indeed
a
very
hot
day
but
the
nearness
of
that
great
mountain
of
ice
made
us
all
turn
up
our
and
shiver
with
the
cold
during
those
quiet
peaceful
days
i
improved
my
reading
and
writing
a
great
deal
with
the
doctor
s
help
i
got
on
so
well
that
he
let
me
keep
the
ship
s
log
this
is
a
big
book
kept
on
every
ship
a
kind
of
diary
in
which
the
number
of
miles
run
the
direction
of
your
course
and
everything
else
that
happens
is
written
down
the
doctor
too
in
what
spare
time
he
had
was
nearly
always
his
i
used
to
peep
into
these
sometimes
now
that
i
could
read
but
i
found
it
hard
work
to
make
out
the
doctor
s
handwriting
many
of
these
seemed
to
be
about
sea
things
there
were
six
thick
ones
filled
full
with
notes
and
sketches
of
different
seaweeds
and
there
were
others
on
sea
birds
others
on
sea
worms
others
on
seashells
they
were
all
some
day
to
be
printed
and
bound
like
regular
books
one
afternoon
we
saw
floating
around
us
great
quantities
of
stuff
that
looked
like
dead
grass
the
doctor
told
me
this
was
a
little
further
on
it
became
so
thick
that
it
covered
all
the
water
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
it
made
the
look
as
though
she
were
moving
across
a
meadow
instead
of
sailing
the
atlantic
crawling
about
upon
this
weed
many
crabs
were
to
be
seen
and
the
sight
of
them
reminded
the
doctor
of
his
dream
of
learning
the
language
of
the
shellfish
he
fished
several
of
these
crabs
up
with
a
net
and
put
them
in
his
to
see
if
he
could
understand
them
among
the
crabs
he
also
caught
a
chubby
little
fish
which
he
told
me
was
called
a
silver
fidgit
after
he
had
listened
to
the
crabs
for
a
while
with
no
success
he
put
the
fidgit
into
the
tank
and
began
to
listen
to
that
i
had
to
leave
him
at
this
moment
to
go
and
attend
to
some
duties
on
the
deck
but
presently
i
heard
him
below
shouting
for
me
to
come
down
again
stubbins
he
cried
as
soon
as
he
saw
a
most
extraordinary
m
not
sure
whether
i
m
t
believe
my
own
senses
illustration
he
talks
english
why
doctor
i
said
what
is
it
s
the
matter
the
fidgit
he
whispered
pointing
with
a
trembling
finger
to
the
in
which
the
little
round
fish
was
still
swimming
quietly
he
talks
english
whistles
tunes
talks
english
i
whistles
it
s
it
s
a
fact
said
the
doctor
white
in
the
face
with
excitement
it
s
only
a
few
words
scattered
with
no
particular
sense
to
mixed
up
with
his
own
language
which
i
can
t
make
out
yet
but
they
re
english
words
unless
there
s
something
very
wrong
with
my
the
tune
he
whistles
it
s
as
plain
as
the
same
tune
now
you
listen
and
tell
me
what
you
make
of
it
tell
me
everything
you
hear
don
t
miss
a
i
went
to
the
glass
tank
upon
the
table
while
the
doctor
grabbed
a
and
a
pencil
undoing
my
collar
i
stood
upon
the
empty
he
had
been
using
for
a
stand
and
put
my
right
ear
down
under
the
water
for
some
moments
i
detected
nothing
at
with
my
dry
ear
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
doctor
as
he
waited
all
stiff
and
anxious
for
me
to
say
something
at
last
from
within
the
water
sounding
like
a
child
singing
miles
and
miles
away
i
heard
an
unbelievably
thin
small
voice
ah
i
said
what
is
it
asked
the
doctor
in
a
hoarse
trembly
whisper
what
does
he
say
i
can
t
quite
make
it
out
i
said
it
s
mostly
in
some
strange
fish
but
wait
a
minute
now
i
get
no
smoking
my
here
s
a
queer
one
popcorn
and
picture
postcards
here
this
way
out
don
t
spit
funny
things
to
say
doctor
but
wait
he
s
whistling
the
what
tune
is
it
gasped
the
doctor
john
ah
hah
cried
the
doctor
that
s
what
i
made
it
out
to
and
he
wrote
furiously
in
his
i
went
on
listening
this
is
most
extraordinary
the
doctor
kept
muttering
to
himself
as
his
pencil
went
wiggling
over
the
most
frightfully
thrilling
i
wonder
where
here
s
some
more
i
some
more
english
big
tank
needs
that
s
all
now
he
s
talking
the
big
tank
the
doctor
murmured
frowning
in
a
puzzled
kind
of
way
i
wonder
where
on
earth
he
then
he
bounded
up
out
of
his
chair
i
have
it
he
yelled
this
fish
has
escaped
from
an
aquarium
why
of
course
look
at
the
kind
of
things
he
has
learned
picture
postcards
always
sell
them
in
aquariums
don
t
spit
no
smoking
this
way
out
things
the
attendants
say
and
then
my
here
s
a
queer
one
that
s
the
kind
of
thing
that
people
exclaim
when
they
look
into
the
tanks
it
all
fits
there
s
no
doubt
about
it
stubbins
we
have
here
a
fish
who
has
escaped
from
captivity
and
it
s
quite
certain
by
any
means
but
quite
i
may
now
through
him
be
able
to
establish
communication
with
the
shellfish
this
is
a
great
piece
of
second
the
fidgit
s
story
well
now
that
he
was
started
once
more
upon
his
old
hobby
of
the
shellfish
languages
there
was
no
stopping
the
doctor
he
worked
right
through
the
night
a
little
after
midnight
i
fell
asleep
in
a
chair
about
two
in
the
morning
bumpo
fell
asleep
at
the
wheel
and
for
five
hours
the
was
allowed
to
drift
where
she
liked
but
still
john
dolittle
worked
on
trying
his
hardest
to
understand
the
fidgit
s
language
struggling
to
make
the
fidgit
understand
him
when
i
woke
up
it
was
broad
daylight
again
the
doctor
was
still
standing
at
the
looking
as
tired
as
an
owl
and
dreadfully
wet
but
on
his
face
there
was
a
proud
and
happy
smile
stubbins
he
said
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
stir
i
ve
done
it
i
ve
got
the
key
to
the
fidgit
s
language
it
s
a
frightfully
difficult
different
from
anything
i
ever
heard
the
only
thing
it
reminds
me
ancient
hebrew
it
isn
t
shellfish
but
it
s
a
big
step
towards
it
now
the
next
thing
i
want
you
to
take
a
pencil
and
a
fresh
notebook
and
write
down
everything
i
say
the
fidgit
has
promised
to
tell
me
the
story
of
his
life
i
will
translate
it
into
english
and
you
put
it
down
in
the
book
are
you
ready
once
more
the
doctor
lowered
his
ear
beneath
the
level
of
the
water
and
as
he
began
to
speak
i
started
to
write
and
this
is
the
story
that
the
fidgit
told
us
thirteen
months
in
an
aquarium
i
was
born
in
the
pacific
ocean
close
to
the
coast
of
chile
i
was
one
of
a
family
of
and
ten
soon
after
our
mother
and
father
left
us
we
youngsters
got
scattered
the
family
was
broken
a
herd
of
whales
who
chased
us
i
and
my
sister
clippa
she
was
my
favorite
sister
had
a
very
narrow
escape
for
our
lives
as
a
rule
whales
are
not
very
hard
to
get
away
from
if
you
are
good
at
you
ve
only
got
a
quick
swerve
but
this
one
that
came
after
clippa
and
myself
was
a
very
mean
whale
every
time
he
lost
us
under
a
stone
or
something
he
d
come
back
and
hunt
and
hunt
till
he
routed
us
out
into
the
open
again
i
never
saw
such
a
nasty
persevering
brute
well
we
shook
him
at
not
before
he
had
worried
us
for
hundreds
of
miles
northward
up
the
west
coast
of
south
america
but
luck
was
against
us
that
day
while
we
were
resting
and
trying
to
get
our
breath
another
family
of
fidgits
came
rushing
by
shouting
come
on
swim
for
your
lives
the
are
coming
now
are
particularly
fond
of
fidgits
we
are
you
might
say
their
favorite
for
that
reason
we
always
keep
away
from
deep
muddy
waters
what
s
more
are
not
easy
to
escape
from
they
are
terribly
fast
and
clever
hunters
so
up
we
had
to
jump
and
on
again
after
we
had
gone
a
few
more
hundred
miles
we
looked
back
and
saw
that
the
were
gaining
on
us
so
we
turned
into
a
harbor
it
happened
to
be
one
on
the
west
coast
of
the
united
states
here
we
guessed
and
hoped
the
would
not
be
likely
to
follow
us
as
it
happened
they
didn
t
even
see
us
turn
in
but
dashed
on
northward
and
we
never
saw
them
again
i
hope
they
froze
to
death
in
the
arctic
seas
but
as
i
said
luck
was
against
us
that
day
while
i
and
my
sister
were
cruising
gently
round
the
ships
anchored
in
the
harbor
looking
for
a
great
delicacy
with
bang
were
caught
in
a
net
we
struggled
for
all
we
were
worth
but
it
was
no
use
the
net
was
and
strongly
made
kicking
and
flipping
we
were
hauled
up
the
side
of
the
ship
and
dumped
down
on
the
deck
high
and
dry
in
a
blazing
sun
here
a
couple
of
old
men
in
whiskers
and
spectacles
leant
over
us
making
strange
sounds
some
codling
had
got
caught
in
the
net
the
same
time
as
we
were
these
the
old
men
threw
back
into
the
sea
but
us
they
seemed
to
think
very
precious
they
put
us
carefully
into
a
large
jar
and
after
they
had
taken
us
on
shore
they
went
to
a
big
house
and
changed
us
from
the
jar
into
glass
boxes
full
of
water
this
house
was
on
the
edge
of
the
harbor
and
a
small
stream
of
was
made
to
flow
through
the
glass
tank
so
we
could
breathe
properly
of
course
we
had
never
lived
inside
glass
walls
before
and
at
first
we
kept
on
trying
to
swim
through
them
and
got
our
noses
awfully
sore
bumping
the
glass
at
full
speed
then
followed
weeks
and
weeks
of
weary
idleness
they
treated
us
well
so
far
as
they
knew
how
the
old
fellows
in
spectacles
came
and
looked
at
us
proudly
twice
a
day
and
saw
that
we
had
the
proper
food
to
eat
the
right
amount
of
light
and
that
the
water
was
not
too
hot
or
too
cold
but
oh
the
dullness
of
that
life
it
seemed
we
were
a
kind
of
a
show
at
a
certain
hour
every
morning
the
big
doors
of
the
house
were
thrown
open
and
everybody
in
the
city
who
had
nothing
special
to
do
came
in
and
looked
at
us
there
were
other
tanks
filled
with
different
kinds
of
fishes
all
round
the
walls
of
the
big
room
and
the
crowds
would
go
from
tank
to
tank
looking
in
at
us
through
the
their
mouths
open
like
flounders
we
got
so
sick
of
it
that
we
used
to
open
our
mouths
back
at
them
and
this
they
seemed
to
think
highly
comical
one
day
my
sister
said
to
me
think
you
brother
that
these
strange
creatures
who
have
captured
us
can
talk
surely
said
i
have
you
not
noticed
that
some
talk
with
the
lips
only
some
with
the
whole
face
and
yet
others
discourse
with
the
hands
when
they
come
quite
close
to
the
glass
you
can
hear
them
listen
at
that
moment
a
female
larger
than
the
rest
pressed
her
nose
up
against
the
glass
pointed
at
me
and
said
to
her
young
behind
her
oh
look
here
s
a
queer
one
and
then
we
noticed
that
they
nearly
always
said
this
when
they
looked
in
and
for
a
long
time
we
thought
that
such
was
the
whole
extent
of
the
language
this
being
a
people
of
but
few
ideas
to
help
pass
away
the
weary
hours
we
learned
it
by
heart
oh
look
here
s
a
queer
one
but
we
never
got
to
know
what
it
meant
other
phrases
however
we
did
get
the
meaning
of
and
we
even
learned
to
read
a
little
in
many
big
signs
there
were
set
up
upon
the
walls
and
when
we
saw
that
the
keepers
stopped
the
people
from
spitting
and
smoking
pointed
to
these
signs
angrily
and
read
them
out
loud
we
knew
then
that
these
writings
signified
and
t
then
in
the
evenings
after
the
crowd
had
gone
the
same
aged
male
with
one
leg
of
wood
swept
up
the
with
a
broom
every
night
and
while
he
was
so
doing
he
always
whistled
the
same
tune
to
himself
this
melody
we
rather
liked
and
we
learned
that
too
by
it
was
part
of
the
language
thus
a
whole
year
went
by
in
this
dismal
place
some
days
new
fishes
were
brought
in
to
the
other
tanks
and
other
days
old
fishes
were
taken
out
at
first
we
had
hoped
we
would
only
be
kept
here
for
a
while
and
that
after
we
had
been
looked
at
sufficiently
we
would
be
returned
to
freedom
and
the
sea
but
as
month
after
month
went
by
and
we
were
left
undisturbed
our
hearts
grew
heavy
within
our
of
glass
and
we
spoke
to
one
another
less
and
less
one
day
when
the
crowd
was
thickest
in
the
big
room
a
woman
with
a
red
face
fainted
from
the
heat
i
watched
through
the
glass
and
saw
that
the
rest
of
the
people
got
highly
to
me
it
did
not
seem
to
be
a
matter
of
very
great
importance
they
threw
cold
water
on
her
and
carried
her
out
into
the
open
air
this
made
me
think
mightily
and
presently
a
great
idea
burst
upon
me
sister
i
said
turning
to
poor
clippa
who
was
sulking
at
the
bottom
of
our
prison
trying
to
hide
behind
a
stone
from
the
stupid
gaze
of
the
children
who
thronged
about
our
tank
supposing
that
pretended
we
were
sick
do
you
think
they
would
take
us
also
from
this
stuffy
house
brother
said
she
wearily
that
they
might
do
but
most
likely
they
would
throw
us
on
a
where
we
would
die
in
the
hot
but
said
i
why
should
they
go
abroad
to
seek
a
when
the
harbor
is
so
close
while
we
were
being
brought
here
i
saw
men
throwing
their
rubbish
into
the
water
if
they
would
only
throw
us
also
there
we
could
quickly
reach
the
the
sea
murmured
poor
clippa
with
a
look
in
her
eyes
she
had
fine
eyes
had
my
sister
clippa
how
like
a
dream
it
sea
oh
brother
will
we
ever
swim
in
it
again
think
you
every
night
as
i
lie
awake
on
the
floor
of
this
dungeon
i
hear
its
hearty
voice
ringing
in
my
ears
how
i
have
longed
for
it
just
to
feel
it
once
again
the
nice
big
wholesome
homeliness
of
it
all
to
jump
just
to
jump
from
the
crest
of
an
atlantic
wave
laughing
in
the
trade
wind
s
spindrift
down
into
the
swirling
trough
to
chase
the
shrimps
on
a
summer
evening
when
the
sky
is
red
and
the
light
s
all
pink
within
the
foam
to
lie
on
the
top
in
the
doldrums
noonday
calm
and
warm
your
tummy
in
the
tropic
sun
to
wander
hand
in
hand
once
more
through
the
giant
seaweed
forests
of
the
indian
ocean
seeking
the
delicious
eggs
of
the
to
play
among
the
castles
of
the
coral
towns
with
their
pearl
and
jasper
windows
spangling
the
floor
of
the
spanish
main
to
picnic
in
the
dim
blue
and
that
lie
in
the
lowlands
beyond
the
south
sea
garden
to
throw
somersaults
on
the
springy
of
the
mexican
gulf
to
poke
about
among
the
dead
ships
and
see
what
wonders
and
adventures
lie
inside
then
on
winter
nights
when
the
northeaster
whips
the
water
into
froth
to
swoop
down
and
down
to
get
away
from
the
cold
down
to
where
the
water
s
warm
and
dark
down
and
still
down
till
we
spy
the
twinkle
of
the
far
below
where
our
friends
and
cousins
sit
chatting
round
the
council
brother
over
the
news
and
gossip
of
and
then
she
broke
down
completely
sniffling
stop
it
i
said
you
make
me
homesick
look
here
let
s
pretend
we
re
better
still
let
s
pretend
we
re
dead
and
see
what
happens
if
they
throw
us
on
a
and
we
fry
in
the
sun
we
ll
not
be
much
worse
off
than
we
are
here
in
this
smelly
prison
what
do
you
say
will
you
risk
it
i
will
she
and
so
next
morning
two
fidgits
were
found
by
the
keeper
floating
on
the
top
of
the
water
in
their
tank
stiff
and
dead
we
gave
a
mighty
good
imitation
of
dead
i
say
it
myself
the
keeper
ran
and
got
the
old
gentlemen
with
spectacles
and
whiskers
they
threw
up
their
hands
in
horror
when
they
saw
us
lifting
us
carefully
out
of
the
water
they
laid
us
on
wet
cloths
that
was
the
hardest
part
of
all
if
you
re
a
fish
and
get
taken
out
of
the
water
you
have
to
keep
opening
and
shutting
your
mouth
to
breathe
at
even
that
you
can
t
keep
up
for
long
and
all
this
time
we
had
to
stay
stiff
as
sticks
and
breathe
silently
through
lips
well
the
old
fellows
poked
us
and
felt
us
and
pinched
us
till
i
thought
they
d
never
be
done
then
when
their
backs
were
turned
a
moment
a
wretched
cat
got
up
on
the
table
and
nearly
ate
us
luckily
the
old
men
turned
round
in
time
and
shooed
her
away
you
may
be
sure
though
that
we
took
a
couple
of
good
gulps
of
air
while
they
weren
t
looking
and
that
was
the
only
thing
that
saved
us
from
choking
i
wanted
to
whisper
to
clippa
to
be
brave
and
stick
it
out
but
i
couldn
t
even
do
that
because
as
you
know
most
kinds
of
can
not
be
even
a
you
re
under
water
then
just
as
we
were
about
to
give
it
up
and
let
on
that
we
were
alive
one
of
the
old
men
shook
his
head
sadly
lifted
us
up
and
carried
us
out
of
the
building
now
for
it
i
thought
to
myself
we
ll
soon
know
our
fate
liberty
or
the
outside
to
our
unspeakable
horror
he
made
straight
for
a
large
which
stood
against
the
wall
on
the
other
side
of
a
yard
most
happily
for
us
however
while
he
was
crossing
this
yard
a
very
dirty
man
with
a
wagon
and
horses
drove
up
and
took
the
away
i
suppose
it
was
his
property
then
the
old
man
looked
around
for
some
other
place
to
throw
us
he
seemed
about
to
cast
us
upon
the
ground
but
he
evidently
thought
that
this
would
make
the
yard
untidy
and
he
desisted
the
suspense
was
terrible
he
moved
outside
the
and
my
heart
sank
once
more
as
i
saw
that
he
now
intended
to
throw
us
in
the
gutter
of
the
roadway
but
fortune
was
indeed
with
us
that
day
a
large
man
in
blue
clothes
and
silver
buttons
stopped
him
in
the
nick
of
time
evidently
from
the
way
the
large
man
lectured
and
waved
a
short
thick
stick
it
was
against
the
rules
of
the
town
to
throw
dead
fish
in
the
streets
at
last
to
our
unutterable
joy
the
old
man
turned
and
moved
off
with
us
towards
the
harbor
he
walked
so
slowly
muttering
to
himself
all
the
way
and
watching
the
man
in
blue
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
that
i
wanted
to
bite
his
finger
to
make
him
hurry
up
both
clippa
and
i
were
actually
at
our
last
gasp
finally
he
reached
the
and
giving
us
one
last
sad
look
he
dropped
us
into
the
waters
of
the
harbor
never
had
we
realized
anything
like
the
thrill
of
that
moment
as
we
felt
the
salt
wetness
close
over
our
heads
with
one
flick
of
our
tails
we
came
to
life
again
the
old
man
was
so
surprised
that
he
fell
right
into
the
water
almost
on
top
of
us
from
this
he
was
rescued
by
a
sailor
with
a
and
the
last
we
saw
of
him
the
man
in
blue
was
dragging
him
away
by
the
lecturing
him
again
apparently
it
was
also
against
the
rules
of
the
town
to
throw
dead
fish
into
the
harbor
but
we
time
or
thought
had
we
for
his
troubles
were
free
in
lightning
leaps
in
curving
spurts
in
crazy
shrieking
with
delight
we
sped
for
home
and
the
open
sea
that
is
all
of
my
story
and
i
will
now
as
i
promised
last
night
try
to
answer
any
questions
you
may
ask
about
the
sea
on
condition
that
i
am
set
at
liberty
as
soon
as
you
have
doctor
is
there
any
part
of
the
sea
deeper
than
that
known
as
the
nero
mean
the
one
near
the
island
of
guam
fidgit
why
certainly
there
s
one
much
deeper
than
that
near
the
mouth
of
the
amazon
river
but
it
s
small
and
hard
to
find
we
call
it
the
deep
and
there
s
another
in
the
antarctic
doctor
can
you
talk
any
shellfish
language
yourself
fidgit
no
not
a
word
we
regular
fishes
don
t
have
anything
to
do
with
the
shellfish
we
consider
them
a
low
doctor
but
when
you
re
near
them
can
you
hear
the
sound
they
make
mean
without
necessarily
understanding
what
they
say
fidgit
only
with
the
very
largest
ones
shellfish
have
such
weak
small
voices
it
is
almost
impossible
for
any
but
their
own
kind
to
hear
them
but
with
the
bigger
ones
it
is
different
they
make
a
sad
booming
noise
rather
like
an
iron
pipe
being
knocked
with
a
not
nearly
so
loud
of
doctor
i
am
most
anxious
to
get
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
study
many
things
but
we
land
animals
as
you
no
doubt
know
are
unable
to
breathe
under
water
have
you
any
ideas
that
might
help
me
fidgit
i
think
that
for
both
your
difficulties
the
best
thing
for
you
to
do
would
be
to
try
and
get
hold
of
the
great
glass
sea
doctor
or
what
is
the
great
glass
sea
snail
fidgit
he
is
an
enormous
snail
one
of
the
winkle
family
but
as
large
as
a
big
house
he
talks
quite
he
speaks
but
this
is
not
often
he
can
go
to
any
part
of
the
ocean
at
all
depths
because
he
doesn
t
have
to
be
afraid
of
any
creature
in
the
sea
his
shell
is
made
of
transparent
so
that
you
can
see
through
it
but
it
s
thick
and
strong
when
he
is
out
of
his
shell
and
he
carries
it
empty
on
his
back
there
is
room
in
it
for
a
wagon
and
a
pair
of
horses
he
has
been
seen
carrying
his
food
in
it
when
doctor
i
feel
that
that
is
just
the
creature
i
have
been
looking
for
he
could
take
me
and
my
assistant
inside
his
shell
and
we
could
explore
the
deepest
depths
in
safety
do
you
think
you
could
get
him
for
me
fidgit
alas
no
i
would
willingly
if
i
could
but
he
is
hardly
ever
seen
by
ordinary
fish
he
lives
at
the
bottom
of
the
deep
hole
and
seldom
comes
into
the
deep
hole
the
lower
waters
of
which
are
muddy
fishes
such
as
we
are
afraid
to
doctor
dear
me
that
s
a
terrible
disappointment
are
there
many
of
this
kind
of
snail
in
the
sea
fidgit
oh
no
he
is
the
only
one
in
existence
since
his
second
wife
died
long
long
ago
he
is
the
last
of
the
giant
shellfish
he
belongs
to
past
ages
when
the
whales
were
and
all
that
they
say
he
is
over
seventy
thousand
years
doctor
good
gracious
what
wonderful
things
he
could
tell
me
i
do
wish
i
could
meet
fidgit
were
there
any
more
questions
you
wished
to
ask
me
this
water
in
your
tank
is
getting
quite
warm
and
sickly
i
d
like
to
be
put
back
into
the
sea
as
soon
as
you
can
spare
doctor
just
one
more
thing
when
christopher
columbus
crossed
the
atlantic
in
he
threw
overboard
two
copies
of
his
diary
sealed
up
in
barrels
one
of
them
was
never
found
it
must
have
sunk
i
would
like
to
get
it
for
my
library
do
you
happen
to
know
where
it
is
fidgit
yes
i
do
that
too
is
in
the
deep
hole
when
the
barrel
sank
the
currents
drifted
it
northwards
down
what
we
call
the
orinoco
slope
till
it
finally
disappeared
into
the
deep
hole
if
it
was
any
other
part
of
the
sea
i
d
try
and
get
it
for
you
but
not
doctor
well
that
is
all
i
think
i
hate
to
put
you
back
into
the
sea
because
i
know
that
as
soon
as
i
do
i
ll
think
of
a
hundred
other
questions
i
wanted
to
ask
you
but
i
must
keep
my
promise
would
you
care
for
anything
before
you
go
seems
a
cold
or
something
fidgit
no
i
won
t
stop
all
i
want
just
at
present
is
fresh
doctor
i
can
not
thank
you
enough
for
all
the
information
you
have
given
me
you
have
been
very
helpful
and
fidgit
pray
do
not
mention
it
it
has
been
a
real
pleasure
to
be
of
assistance
to
the
great
john
dolittle
you
are
as
of
course
you
know
already
quite
famous
among
the
better
class
of
fishes
goodbye
good
luck
to
you
to
your
ship
and
to
all
your
plans
the
doctor
carried
the
to
a
opened
it
and
emptied
the
tank
into
the
sea
he
murmured
as
a
faint
splash
reached
us
from
without
i
dropped
my
pencil
on
the
table
and
leaned
back
with
a
sigh
my
fingers
were
so
stiff
with
writers
cramp
that
i
felt
as
though
i
should
never
be
able
to
open
my
hand
again
but
i
at
least
had
had
a
night
s
sleep
as
for
the
poor
doctor
he
was
so
weary
that
he
had
hardly
put
the
tank
back
upon
the
table
and
dropped
into
a
chair
when
his
eyes
closed
and
he
began
to
snore
in
the
passage
outside
polynesia
scratched
angrily
at
the
door
i
rose
and
let
her
in
a
nice
state
of
affairs
she
stormed
what
sort
of
a
ship
is
this
there
s
that
colored
man
upstairs
asleep
under
the
wheel
the
doctor
asleep
down
here
and
you
making
in
a
copybook
with
a
pencil
expect
the
ship
to
steer
herself
to
brazil
we
re
just
drifting
around
the
sea
like
an
empty
a
week
behind
time
as
it
is
what
s
happened
to
you
all
she
was
so
angry
that
her
voice
rose
to
a
scream
but
it
would
have
taken
more
than
that
to
wake
the
doctor
i
put
the
carefully
in
a
drawer
and
went
on
deck
to
take
the
wheel
third
bad
weather
as
soon
as
i
had
the
swung
round
upon
her
course
again
i
noticed
something
peculiar
we
were
not
going
as
fast
as
we
had
been
our
favorable
wind
had
almost
entirely
disappeared
this
at
first
we
did
not
worry
about
thinking
that
at
any
moment
it
might
spring
up
again
but
the
whole
day
went
by
then
two
days
then
a
week
days
and
the
wind
grew
no
stronger
the
just
dawdled
along
at
the
speed
of
a
toddling
babe
i
now
saw
that
the
doctor
was
becoming
uneasy
he
kept
getting
out
his
sextant
an
instrument
which
tells
you
what
part
of
the
ocean
you
are
in
and
making
calculations
he
was
forever
looking
at
his
maps
and
measuring
distances
on
them
the
far
edge
of
the
sea
all
around
us
he
examined
with
his
telescope
a
hundred
times
a
day
but
doctor
i
said
when
i
found
him
one
afternoon
mumbling
to
himself
about
the
misty
appearance
of
the
sky
it
wouldn
t
matter
so
much
would
it
if
we
did
take
a
little
longer
over
the
trip
we
ve
got
plenty
to
eat
on
board
now
and
the
purple
will
know
that
we
have
been
delayed
by
something
that
we
couldn
t
yes
i
suppose
so
he
said
thoughtfully
but
i
hate
to
keep
her
waiting
at
this
season
of
the
year
she
generally
goes
to
the
peruvian
her
health
and
besides
the
good
weather
she
prophesied
is
likely
to
end
any
day
now
and
delay
us
still
further
if
we
could
only
keep
moving
at
even
a
fair
speed
i
wouldn
t
mind
it
s
this
hanging
around
almost
dead
still
that
gets
me
here
comes
a
very
maybe
it
ll
a
gentle
breeze
from
the
northeast
came
singing
through
the
ropes
and
we
smiled
up
hopefully
at
the
leaning
masts
we
ve
only
got
another
hundred
and
fifty
miles
to
make
to
sight
the
coast
of
brazil
said
the
doctor
if
that
wind
would
just
stay
with
us
steady
for
a
full
day
we
d
see
but
suddenly
the
wind
changed
swung
to
the
east
then
back
to
the
to
the
north
it
came
in
fitful
gusts
as
though
it
hadn
t
made
up
its
mind
which
way
to
blow
and
i
was
kept
busy
at
the
wheel
swinging
the
this
way
and
that
to
keep
the
right
side
of
it
presently
we
heard
polynesia
who
was
in
the
rigging
keeping
a
for
land
or
passing
ships
screech
down
to
us
bad
weather
coming
that
jumpy
wind
is
an
ugly
sign
and
look
there
in
the
that
black
line
low
down
if
that
isn
t
a
storm
i
m
a
the
gales
round
here
are
fierce
when
they
do
your
canvas
out
like
paper
you
take
the
wheel
doctor
it
ll
need
a
strong
arm
if
it
s
a
real
storm
i
ll
go
wake
bumpo
and
this
looks
bad
to
me
we
d
best
get
all
the
sail
down
right
away
till
we
see
how
strong
she
s
going
to
indeed
the
whole
sky
was
now
beginning
to
take
on
a
very
threatening
look
the
black
line
to
the
eastward
grew
blacker
as
it
came
nearer
and
nearer
a
low
rumbly
whispering
noise
went
moaning
over
the
sea
the
water
which
had
been
so
blue
and
smiling
turned
to
a
ruffled
ugly
gray
and
across
the
darkening
sky
shreds
of
cloud
swept
like
tattered
witches
flying
from
the
storm
i
must
confess
i
was
frightened
you
see
i
had
only
so
far
seen
the
sea
in
friendly
moods
sometimes
quiet
and
lazy
sometimes
laughing
venturesome
and
reckless
sometimes
brooding
and
poetic
when
moonbeams
turned
her
ripples
into
silver
threads
and
dreaming
snowy
piled
up
in
the
sky
but
as
yet
i
had
not
known
or
even
guessed
at
the
terrible
strength
of
the
sea
s
wild
anger
when
that
storm
finally
struck
us
we
leaned
right
over
flatly
on
our
side
as
though
some
invisible
giant
had
slapped
the
poor
on
the
cheek
after
that
things
happened
so
thick
and
so
fast
that
what
with
the
wind
that
stopped
your
breath
the
driving
blinding
water
the
deafening
noise
and
the
rest
i
haven
t
a
very
clear
idea
of
how
our
shipwreck
came
about
i
remember
seeing
the
sails
which
we
were
now
trying
to
roll
up
upon
the
deck
torn
out
of
our
hands
by
the
wind
and
go
overboard
like
a
penny
nearly
carrying
with
them
and
i
have
a
dim
recollection
of
polynesia
screeching
somewhere
for
one
of
us
to
go
downstairs
and
close
the
in
spite
of
our
masts
being
bare
of
sail
we
were
now
scudding
along
to
the
southward
at
a
great
pace
but
every
once
in
a
while
huge
waves
would
arise
from
under
the
ship
s
side
like
nightmare
monsters
swell
and
climb
then
crash
down
upon
us
pressing
us
into
the
sea
and
the
poor
would
come
to
a
standstill
half
under
water
like
a
gasping
drowning
pig
while
i
was
clambering
along
towards
the
wheel
to
see
the
doctor
clinging
like
a
leech
with
hands
and
legs
to
the
rails
lest
i
be
blown
overboard
one
of
these
tremendous
seas
tore
loose
my
hold
filled
my
throat
with
water
and
swept
me
like
a
cork
the
full
length
of
the
deck
my
head
struck
a
door
with
an
awful
bang
and
then
i
fainted
fourth
wrecked
when
i
awoke
i
was
very
hazy
in
my
head
the
sky
was
blue
and
the
sea
was
calm
at
first
i
thought
that
i
must
have
fallen
asleep
in
the
sun
on
the
deck
of
the
and
thinking
that
i
would
be
late
for
my
turn
at
the
wheel
i
tried
to
rise
to
my
feet
i
found
i
couldn
t
my
arms
were
tied
to
something
behind
me
with
a
piece
of
rope
by
twisting
my
neck
around
i
found
this
to
be
a
mast
broken
off
short
then
i
realized
that
i
wasn
t
sitting
on
a
ship
at
all
i
was
only
sitting
on
a
piece
of
one
i
began
to
feel
uncomfortably
scared
screwing
up
my
eyes
i
searched
the
rim
of
the
sea
north
east
south
and
west
no
land
no
ships
nothing
was
in
sight
i
was
alone
in
the
ocean
at
last
little
by
little
my
bruised
head
began
to
remember
what
had
happened
first
the
coming
of
the
storm
the
sails
going
overboard
then
the
big
wave
which
had
banged
me
against
the
door
but
what
had
become
of
the
doctor
and
the
others
what
day
was
this
or
the
day
after
why
was
i
sitting
on
only
part
of
a
ship
illustration
i
was
alone
in
the
ocean
working
my
hand
into
my
pocket
i
found
my
penknife
and
cut
the
rope
that
tied
me
this
reminded
me
of
a
shipwreck
story
which
joe
had
once
told
me
of
a
captain
who
had
tied
his
son
to
a
mast
in
order
that
he
shouldn
t
be
washed
overboard
by
the
gale
so
of
course
it
must
have
been
the
doctor
who
had
done
the
same
to
me
but
where
was
he
the
awful
thought
came
to
me
that
the
doctor
and
the
rest
of
them
must
be
drowned
since
there
was
no
other
wreckage
to
be
seen
upon
the
waters
i
got
to
my
feet
and
stared
around
the
sea
but
water
and
sky
presently
a
long
way
off
i
saw
the
small
dark
shape
of
a
bird
skimming
low
down
over
the
swell
when
it
came
quite
close
i
saw
it
was
a
stormy
petrel
i
tried
to
talk
to
it
to
see
if
it
could
give
me
news
but
unluckily
i
hadn
t
learned
much
seabird
language
and
i
couldn
t
even
attract
its
attention
much
less
make
it
understand
what
i
wanted
twice
it
circled
round
my
raft
lazily
with
hardly
a
flip
of
the
wing
and
i
could
not
help
wondering
in
spite
of
the
distress
i
was
in
where
it
had
spent
last
it
or
any
other
living
thing
had
weathered
such
a
smashing
storm
it
made
me
realize
the
great
big
difference
between
different
creatures
and
that
size
and
strength
are
not
everything
to
this
petrel
a
frail
little
thing
of
feathers
much
smaller
and
weaker
than
i
the
sea
could
do
anything
she
liked
it
seemed
and
his
only
answer
was
a
lazy
saucy
flip
of
the
wing
was
the
one
who
should
be
called
the
for
come
raging
gale
come
sunlit
calm
this
wilderness
of
water
was
his
home
after
swooping
over
the
sea
around
me
just
looking
for
food
i
supposed
he
went
off
in
the
direction
from
which
he
had
come
and
i
was
alone
once
more
i
found
i
was
somewhat
a
little
thirsty
too
i
began
to
think
all
sorts
of
miserable
thoughts
the
way
one
does
when
he
is
lonesome
and
has
missed
breakfast
what
was
going
to
become
of
me
now
if
the
doctor
and
the
rest
were
drowned
i
would
starve
to
death
or
die
of
thirst
then
the
sun
went
behind
some
clouds
and
i
felt
cold
how
many
hundreds
or
thousands
of
miles
was
i
from
any
land
what
if
another
storm
should
come
and
smash
up
even
this
poor
raft
on
which
i
stood
i
went
on
like
this
for
a
while
growing
gloomier
and
gloomier
when
suddenly
i
thought
of
polynesia
you
re
always
safe
with
the
doctor
she
had
said
he
gets
there
remember
i
m
sure
i
wouldn
t
have
minded
so
much
if
he
had
been
here
with
me
it
was
this
being
all
alone
that
made
me
want
to
weep
and
yet
the
petrel
was
alone
a
baby
i
was
i
told
myself
to
be
scared
to
the
verge
of
tears
just
by
loneliness
i
was
quite
safe
where
i
the
present
anyhow
john
dolittle
wouldn
t
get
scared
by
a
little
thing
like
this
he
only
got
excited
when
he
made
a
discovery
found
a
new
bug
or
something
and
if
what
polynesia
had
said
was
true
he
couldn
t
be
drowned
and
things
would
come
out
all
right
in
the
end
somehow
i
threw
out
my
chest
buttoned
up
my
collar
and
began
walking
up
and
down
the
short
raft
to
keep
warm
i
would
be
like
john
dolittle
i
wouldn
t
i
wouldn
t
get
excited
how
long
i
paced
back
and
forth
i
don
t
know
but
it
was
a
long
i
had
nothing
else
to
do
at
last
i
got
tired
and
lay
down
to
rest
and
in
spite
of
all
my
troubles
i
soon
fell
fast
asleep
this
time
when
i
woke
up
stars
were
staring
down
at
me
out
of
a
cloudless
sky
the
sea
was
still
calm
and
my
strange
craft
was
rocking
gently
under
me
on
an
easy
swell
all
my
fine
courage
left
me
as
i
gazed
up
into
the
big
silent
night
and
felt
the
pains
of
hunger
and
thirst
set
to
work
in
my
stomach
harder
than
ever
are
you
awake
said
a
high
silvery
voice
at
my
elbow
i
sprang
up
as
though
some
one
had
stuck
a
pin
in
me
and
there
perched
at
the
very
end
of
my
raft
her
beautiful
golden
tail
glowing
dimly
in
the
starlight
sat
miranda
the
purple
never
have
i
been
so
glad
to
see
any
one
in
my
life
i
almost
fell
into
the
water
as
i
leapt
to
hug
her
i
didn
t
want
to
wake
you
said
she
i
guessed
you
must
be
tired
after
all
you
ve
been
t
squash
the
life
out
of
me
boy
i
m
not
a
stuffed
duck
you
oh
miranda
you
dear
old
thing
said
i
i
m
so
glad
to
see
you
tell
me
where
is
the
doctor
is
he
alive
of
course
he
s
it
s
my
firm
belief
he
always
will
be
he
s
over
there
about
forty
miles
to
the
what
s
he
doing
there
he
s
sitting
on
the
other
half
of
the
shaving
he
was
when
i
left
well
thank
heaven
he
s
alive
said
and
the
animals
are
they
all
right
yes
they
re
with
him
your
ship
broke
in
half
in
the
storm
the
doctor
had
tied
you
down
when
he
found
you
stunned
and
the
part
you
were
on
got
separated
and
floated
away
golly
it
a
storm
one
has
to
be
a
gull
or
an
albatross
to
stand
that
sort
of
weather
i
had
been
watching
for
the
doctor
for
three
weeks
from
a
but
last
night
i
had
to
take
refuge
in
a
cave
to
keep
my
from
blowing
out
as
soon
as
i
found
the
doctor
he
sent
me
off
with
some
porpoises
to
help
us
in
our
search
there
had
been
quite
a
gathering
of
waiting
to
greet
the
doctor
but
the
rough
weather
sort
of
broke
up
the
arrangements
that
had
been
made
to
welcome
him
properly
it
was
the
petrel
that
first
gave
us
the
tip
where
you
well
but
how
can
i
get
to
the
doctor
miranda
haven
t
any
get
to
him
you
re
going
to
him
now
look
behind
i
turned
around
the
moon
was
just
rising
on
the
sea
s
edge
and
i
now
saw
that
my
raft
was
moving
through
the
water
but
so
gently
that
i
had
not
noticed
it
before
what
s
moving
us
i
asked
the
porpoises
said
miranda
i
went
to
the
back
of
the
raft
and
looked
down
into
the
water
and
just
below
the
surface
i
could
see
the
dim
forms
of
four
big
porpoises
their
sleek
skins
glinting
in
the
moonlight
pushing
at
the
raft
with
their
noses
they
re
old
friends
of
the
doctor
s
said
miranda
they
d
do
anything
for
john
dolittle
we
should
see
his
party
soon
now
we
re
pretty
near
the
place
i
left
there
they
are
see
that
dark
shape
more
to
the
right
of
where
you
re
looking
can
t
you
make
out
the
figure
of
the
black
man
standing
against
the
sky
spies
s
waving
don
t
you
see
them
i
didn
my
eyes
were
not
as
sharp
as
miranda
s
but
presently
from
somewhere
in
the
murky
dusk
i
heard
bumpo
singing
his
african
comic
songs
with
the
full
force
of
his
enormous
voice
and
in
a
little
by
peering
and
peering
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
i
at
last
made
out
a
dim
mass
of
tattered
splintered
that
remained
of
the
poor
low
down
upon
the
water
a
hulloa
came
through
the
night
and
i
answered
it
we
kept
it
up
calling
to
one
another
back
and
forth
across
the
calm
night
sea
and
a
few
minutes
later
the
two
halves
of
our
brave
little
ruined
ship
bumped
gently
together
again
now
that
i
was
nearer
and
the
moon
was
higher
i
could
see
more
plainly
their
half
of
the
ship
was
much
bigger
than
mine
it
lay
partly
upon
its
side
and
most
of
them
were
perched
upon
the
top
munching
ship
s
biscuit
but
close
down
to
the
edge
of
the
water
using
the
sea
s
calm
surface
for
a
mirror
and
a
piece
of
broken
bottle
for
a
razor
john
dolittle
was
shaving
his
face
by
the
light
of
the
moon
fifth
land
they
all
gave
me
a
great
greeting
as
i
clambered
off
my
half
of
the
ship
on
to
theirs
bumpo
brought
me
a
wonderful
drink
of
fresh
water
which
he
drew
from
a
barrel
and
and
polynesia
stood
around
me
feeding
me
ship
s
biscuit
but
it
was
the
sight
of
the
doctor
s
smiling
knowing
that
i
was
with
him
once
cheered
me
more
than
anything
else
as
i
watched
him
carefully
wipe
his
glass
razor
and
put
it
away
for
future
use
i
could
not
help
comparing
him
in
my
mind
with
the
stormy
petrel
indeed
the
vast
strange
knowledge
which
he
had
gained
from
his
speech
and
friendship
with
animals
had
brought
him
the
power
to
do
things
which
no
other
human
being
would
dare
to
try
like
the
petrel
he
could
apparently
play
with
the
sea
in
all
her
moods
it
was
no
wonder
that
many
of
the
ignorant
savage
peoples
among
whom
he
passed
in
his
voyages
made
statues
of
him
showing
him
as
half
a
fish
half
a
bird
and
half
a
man
and
ridiculous
though
it
was
i
could
quite
understand
what
miranda
meant
when
she
said
she
firmly
believed
that
he
could
never
die
just
to
be
with
him
gave
you
a
wonderful
feeling
of
comfort
and
safety
except
for
his
appearance
his
clothes
were
crumpled
and
damp
and
his
battered
high
hat
was
stained
with
salt
water
that
storm
which
had
so
terrified
me
had
disturbed
him
no
more
than
getting
stuck
on
the
in
puddleby
river
politely
thanking
miranda
for
getting
me
so
quickly
he
asked
her
if
she
would
now
go
ahead
of
us
and
show
us
the
way
to
spidermonkey
island
next
he
gave
orders
to
the
porpoises
to
leave
my
old
piece
of
the
ship
and
push
the
bigger
half
wherever
the
should
lead
us
how
much
he
had
lost
in
the
wreck
besides
his
razor
i
did
not
most
likely
together
with
all
the
money
he
had
saved
up
to
buy
the
ship
with
and
still
he
was
smiling
as
though
he
wanted
for
nothing
in
the
world
the
only
things
he
had
saved
as
far
as
i
could
the
barrel
of
water
and
bag
of
his
precious
these
i
saw
when
he
stood
up
he
had
strapped
around
his
waist
with
yards
and
yards
of
twine
he
was
as
old
matthew
mugg
used
to
say
a
great
man
he
was
unbelievable
and
now
for
three
days
we
continued
our
journey
slowly
but
the
only
inconvenience
we
suffered
from
was
the
cold
this
seemed
to
increase
as
we
went
forward
the
doctor
said
that
the
island
disturbed
from
its
usual
paths
by
the
great
gale
had
evidently
drifted
further
south
than
it
had
ever
been
before
on
the
third
night
poor
miranda
came
back
to
us
nearly
frozen
she
told
the
doctor
that
in
the
morning
we
would
find
the
island
quite
close
to
us
though
we
couldn
t
see
it
now
as
it
was
a
misty
dark
night
she
said
that
she
must
hurry
back
at
once
to
a
warmer
climate
and
that
she
would
visit
the
doctor
in
puddleby
next
august
as
usual
don
t
forget
miranda
said
john
dolittle
if
you
should
hear
anything
of
what
happened
to
long
arrow
to
get
word
to
the
assured
him
she
would
and
after
the
doctor
had
thanked
her
again
and
again
for
all
that
she
had
done
for
us
she
wished
us
good
luck
and
disappeared
into
the
night
we
were
all
awake
early
in
the
morning
long
before
it
was
light
waiting
for
our
first
glimpse
of
the
country
we
had
come
so
far
to
see
and
as
the
rising
sun
turned
the
eastern
sky
to
gray
of
course
it
was
old
polynesia
who
first
shouted
that
she
could
see
and
mountain
tops
with
the
growing
light
it
became
plain
to
all
of
us
a
long
island
with
high
rocky
mountains
in
the
so
near
to
us
that
you
could
almost
throw
your
hat
upon
the
shore
the
porpoises
gave
us
one
last
push
and
our
craft
bumped
gently
on
a
low
beach
then
thanking
our
lucky
stars
for
a
chance
to
stretch
our
cramped
legs
we
all
bundled
off
on
to
the
first
land
even
though
it
was
floating
land
that
we
had
trodden
for
six
weeks
what
a
thrill
i
felt
as
i
realized
that
spidermonkey
island
the
little
spot
in
the
atlas
which
my
pencil
had
touched
lay
at
last
beneath
my
feet
when
the
light
increased
still
further
we
noticed
that
the
palms
and
grasses
of
the
island
seemed
withered
and
almost
dead
the
doctor
said
that
it
must
be
on
account
of
the
cold
that
the
island
was
now
suffering
from
in
its
new
climate
these
trees
and
grasses
he
told
us
were
the
kind
that
belonged
to
warm
tropical
weather
the
porpoises
asked
if
we
wanted
them
any
further
and
the
doctor
said
that
he
didn
t
think
so
not
for
the
the
raft
either
he
added
for
it
was
already
beginning
to
fall
to
pieces
and
could
not
float
much
longer
as
we
were
preparing
to
go
inland
and
explore
the
island
we
suddenly
noticed
a
whole
band
of
red
indians
watching
us
with
great
curiosity
from
among
the
trees
the
doctor
went
forward
to
talk
to
them
but
he
could
not
make
them
understand
he
tried
by
signs
to
show
them
that
he
had
come
on
a
friendly
visit
the
indians
didn
t
seem
to
like
us
however
they
had
bows
and
arrows
and
long
hunting
spears
with
stone
points
in
their
hands
and
they
made
signs
back
to
the
doctor
to
tell
him
that
if
he
came
a
step
nearer
they
would
kill
us
all
they
evidently
wanted
us
to
leave
the
island
at
once
it
was
a
very
uncomfortable
situation
at
last
the
doctor
made
them
understand
that
he
only
wanted
to
see
the
island
all
over
and
that
then
he
would
go
how
he
meant
to
do
it
with
no
boat
to
sail
in
was
more
than
i
could
imagine
while
they
were
talking
among
themselves
another
indian
with
a
message
that
they
were
wanted
in
some
other
part
of
the
island
because
presently
shaking
their
spears
threateningly
at
us
they
went
off
with
the
newcomer
what
discourteous
pagans
said
bumpo
did
you
ever
see
such
inhospitability
even
asked
us
if
we
d
had
breakfast
the
benighted
bounders
sh
they
re
going
off
to
their
village
said
polynesia
i
ll
bet
there
s
a
village
on
the
other
side
of
those
mountains
if
you
take
my
advice
doctor
you
ll
get
away
from
this
beach
while
their
backs
are
turned
let
us
go
up
into
the
higher
land
for
the
place
where
they
won
t
know
where
we
are
they
may
grow
friendlier
when
they
see
we
mean
no
harm
they
have
honest
open
faces
and
look
like
a
decent
crowd
to
me
they
re
just
never
saw
white
folks
so
feeling
a
little
bit
discouraged
by
our
first
reception
we
moved
off
towards
the
mountains
in
the
centre
of
the
island
sixth
the
jabizri
we
found
the
woods
at
the
feet
of
the
hills
thick
and
tangly
and
somewhat
hard
to
get
through
on
polynesia
s
advice
we
kept
away
from
all
paths
and
trails
feeling
it
best
to
avoid
meeting
any
indians
for
the
present
but
she
and
were
good
guides
and
splendid
and
the
two
of
them
set
to
work
at
once
looking
for
food
for
us
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
they
had
found
quite
a
number
of
different
fruits
and
nuts
which
made
excellent
eating
though
none
of
us
knew
the
names
of
any
of
them
we
discovered
a
nice
clean
stream
of
good
water
which
came
down
from
the
mountains
so
we
were
supplied
with
something
to
drink
as
well
we
followed
the
stream
up
towards
the
heights
and
presently
we
came
to
parts
where
the
woods
were
thinner
and
the
ground
rocky
and
steep
here
we
could
get
glimpses
of
wonderful
views
all
over
the
island
with
the
blue
sea
beyond
while
we
were
admiring
one
of
these
the
doctor
suddenly
said
sh
jabizri
t
you
hear
it
we
listened
and
heard
somewhere
in
the
air
about
us
an
extraordinarily
musical
a
bee
but
not
just
one
note
this
hum
rose
and
fell
up
and
like
some
one
singing
no
other
insect
but
the
jabizri
beetle
hums
like
that
said
the
doctor
i
wonder
where
he
near
by
the
among
the
trees
probably
oh
if
i
only
had
my
why
didn
t
i
think
to
strap
that
around
my
waist
too
confound
the
storm
i
may
miss
the
chance
of
a
lifetime
now
of
getting
the
rarest
beetle
in
the
look
there
he
goes
a
huge
beetle
easily
three
inches
long
i
should
say
suddenly
flew
by
our
noses
the
doctor
got
frightfully
excited
he
took
off
his
hat
to
use
as
a
net
swooped
at
the
beetle
and
caught
it
he
nearly
fell
down
a
precipice
on
to
the
rocks
below
in
his
wild
hurry
but
that
didn
t
bother
him
in
the
least
he
knelt
down
chortling
upon
the
ground
with
the
jabizri
safe
under
his
hat
from
his
pocket
he
brought
out
a
box
and
into
this
he
very
skilfully
made
the
beetle
walk
from
under
the
rim
of
the
hat
then
he
rose
up
happy
as
a
child
to
examine
his
new
treasure
through
the
glass
lid
it
certainly
was
a
most
beautiful
insect
it
was
pale
blue
underneath
but
its
back
was
glossy
black
with
huge
red
spots
on
it
there
isn
t
an
entymologist
in
the
whole
world
who
wouldn
t
give
all
he
has
to
be
in
my
shoes
said
the
hulloa
this
jabizri
s
got
something
on
his
t
look
like
mud
i
wonder
what
it
he
took
the
beetle
carefully
out
of
the
box
and
held
it
by
its
back
in
his
fingers
where
it
waved
its
six
legs
slowly
in
the
air
we
all
crowded
about
him
peering
at
it
rolled
around
the
middle
section
of
its
right
foreleg
was
something
that
looked
like
a
thin
dried
leaf
it
was
bound
on
very
neatly
with
strong
it
was
marvelous
to
see
how
john
dolittle
with
his
fat
heavy
fingers
undid
that
cobweb
cord
and
unrolled
the
leaf
whole
without
tearing
it
or
hurting
the
precious
beetle
the
jabizri
he
put
back
into
the
box
then
he
spread
the
leaf
out
flat
and
examined
it
you
can
imagine
our
surprise
when
we
found
that
the
inside
of
the
leaf
was
covered
with
signs
and
pictures
drawn
so
tiny
that
you
almost
needed
a
to
tell
what
they
were
some
of
the
signs
we
couldn
t
make
out
at
all
but
nearly
all
of
the
pictures
were
quite
plain
figures
of
men
and
mountains
mostly
the
whole
was
done
in
a
curious
sort
of
brown
ink
for
several
moments
there
was
a
dead
silence
while
we
all
stared
at
the
leaf
fascinated
and
mystified
i
think
this
is
written
in
blood
said
the
doctor
at
last
it
turns
that
color
when
it
s
dry
somebody
pricked
his
finger
to
make
these
pictures
it
s
an
old
dodge
when
you
re
short
of
highly
an
extraordinary
thing
to
find
tied
to
a
beetle
s
leg
i
wish
i
could
talk
beetle
language
and
find
out
where
the
jabizri
got
it
but
what
is
it
i
rows
of
little
pictures
and
signs
what
do
you
make
of
it
doctor
it
s
a
letter
he
a
picture
letter
all
these
little
things
put
together
mean
a
why
give
a
message
to
a
beetle
to
to
a
jabizri
the
rarest
beetle
in
the
world
an
extraordinary
thing
then
he
fell
to
muttering
over
the
pictures
i
wonder
what
it
means
men
walking
up
a
mountain
men
walking
into
a
hole
in
a
mountain
a
mountain
falling
s
a
good
drawing
that
men
pointing
to
their
open
mouths
perhaps
men
praying
men
lying
look
as
though
they
might
be
sick
and
last
of
all
just
a
all
of
a
sudden
the
doctor
looked
up
sharply
at
me
a
wonderful
smile
of
delighted
understanding
spreading
over
his
face
arrow
he
cried
don
t
you
see
stubbins
of
course
only
a
naturalist
would
think
of
doing
a
thing
like
this
giving
his
letter
to
a
to
a
common
beetle
but
to
the
rarest
of
all
one
that
other
naturalists
would
try
to
well
long
arrow
from
long
arrow
for
pictures
are
the
only
writing
that
he
yes
but
who
is
the
letter
to
i
asked
it
s
to
me
very
likely
miranda
had
told
him
i
know
years
ago
that
some
day
i
meant
to
come
here
but
if
not
for
me
then
it
s
for
any
one
who
caught
the
beetle
and
read
it
it
s
a
letter
to
the
well
but
what
does
it
say
it
doesn
t
seem
to
me
that
it
s
much
good
to
you
now
you
ve
got
yes
it
is
he
said
because
look
i
can
read
it
now
first
picture
men
walking
up
a
s
long
arrow
and
his
party
men
going
into
a
hole
in
a
enter
a
cave
looking
for
or
mosses
a
mountain
falling
hanging
rocks
must
have
slipped
and
trapped
them
imprisoned
them
in
the
cave
and
this
was
the
only
living
creature
that
could
carry
a
message
for
them
to
the
outside
beetle
who
could
his
way
into
the
open
air
of
course
it
was
only
a
slim
chance
that
the
beetle
would
be
ever
caught
and
the
letter
read
but
it
a
chance
and
when
men
are
in
great
danger
they
grab
at
any
straw
of
hope
all
right
now
look
at
the
next
picture
men
pointing
to
their
open
are
hungry
men
any
one
who
finds
this
letter
to
come
to
their
assistance
men
lying
are
sick
or
starving
this
letter
stubbins
is
their
last
cry
for
he
sprang
to
his
feet
as
he
ended
snatched
out
a
and
put
the
letter
between
the
leaves
his
hands
were
trembling
with
haste
and
agitation
come
on
he
up
the
of
you
there
s
not
a
moment
to
lose
bumpo
bring
the
water
and
nuts
with
you
heaven
only
knows
how
long
they
ve
been
pining
underground
let
s
hope
and
pray
we
re
not
too
late
but
where
are
you
going
to
look
i
asked
miranda
said
the
island
was
a
hundred
miles
long
and
the
mountains
seem
to
run
all
the
way
down
the
centre
of
didn
t
you
see
the
last
picture
he
said
grabbing
up
his
hat
from
the
ground
and
cramming
it
on
his
head
it
was
an
oddly
shaped
like
a
hawk
s
head
well
there
s
where
he
he
s
still
alive
first
thing
for
us
to
do
is
to
get
up
on
a
high
peak
and
look
around
the
island
for
a
mountain
shaped
like
a
hawks
to
think
of
it
there
s
a
chance
of
my
meeting
long
arrow
the
son
of
golden
arrow
after
all
on
hurry
to
delay
may
mean
death
to
the
greatest
naturalist
ever
born
seventh
hawk
mountain
we
all
agreed
afterwards
that
none
of
us
had
ever
worked
so
hard
in
our
lives
before
as
we
did
that
day
for
my
part
i
know
i
was
often
on
the
point
of
dropping
exhausted
with
fatigue
but
i
just
kept
on
a
that
whatever
happened
would
not
be
the
first
to
give
up
when
we
had
scrambled
to
the
top
of
a
high
peak
almost
instantly
we
saw
the
strange
mountain
pictured
in
the
letter
in
shape
it
was
the
perfect
image
of
a
hawk
s
head
and
was
as
far
as
we
could
see
the
second
highest
summit
in
the
island
although
we
were
all
out
of
breath
from
our
climb
the
doctor
didn
t
let
us
rest
a
second
as
soon
as
he
had
sighted
it
with
one
look
at
the
sun
for
direction
down
he
dashed
again
breaking
through
thickets
splashing
over
brooks
taking
all
the
short
cuts
for
a
fat
man
he
was
certainly
the
swiftest
runner
i
ever
saw
we
floundered
after
him
as
fast
as
we
could
when
i
say
i
mean
bumpo
and
myself
for
the
animals
jip
and
polynesia
were
a
long
way
beyond
the
the
hunt
like
a
at
length
we
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
we
were
making
for
and
we
found
its
sides
very
steep
said
the
doctor
now
we
will
separate
and
search
for
caves
this
spot
where
we
now
are
will
be
our
if
anyone
finds
anything
like
a
cave
or
a
hole
where
the
earth
and
rocks
have
fallen
in
he
must
shout
and
hulloa
to
the
rest
of
us
if
we
find
nothing
we
will
all
gather
here
in
about
an
hour
s
understand
then
we
all
went
off
our
different
ways
each
of
us
you
may
be
sure
was
anxious
to
be
the
one
to
make
a
discovery
and
never
was
a
mountain
searched
so
thoroughly
but
alas
nothing
could
we
find
that
looked
in
the
least
like
a
cave
there
were
plenty
of
places
where
rocks
had
tumbled
down
to
the
foot
of
the
slopes
but
none
of
these
appeared
as
though
caves
or
passages
could
possibly
lie
behind
them
one
by
one
tired
and
disappointed
we
straggled
back
to
the
the
doctor
seemed
gloomy
and
impatient
but
by
no
means
inclined
to
give
up
jip
he
said
couldn
t
you
anything
like
an
indian
anywhere
no
said
jip
i
sniffed
at
every
crack
on
the
mountainside
but
i
am
afraid
my
nose
will
be
of
no
use
to
you
here
doctor
the
trouble
is
the
whole
air
is
so
saturated
with
the
smell
of
that
it
drowns
every
other
besides
it
s
too
cold
and
dry
for
good
it
is
certainly
that
said
the
and
getting
colder
all
the
time
i
m
afraid
the
island
is
still
drifting
to
the
southward
let
s
hope
it
stops
before
long
or
we
won
t
be
able
to
get
even
nuts
and
fruit
to
in
the
island
will
what
luck
did
you
have
none
doctor
i
climbed
to
every
peak
and
pinnacle
i
could
see
i
searched
every
hollow
and
cleft
but
not
one
place
could
i
find
where
men
might
be
and
polynesia
asked
the
doctor
did
you
see
nothing
that
might
put
us
on
the
right
track
not
a
thing
i
have
a
oh
good
cried
john
dolittle
full
of
hope
renewed
what
is
it
let
s
hear
you
still
have
that
beetle
with
you
she
the
or
whatever
it
is
you
call
the
wretched
insect
yes
said
the
doctor
producing
the
box
from
his
pocket
here
it
all
right
now
listen
said
she
if
what
you
have
supposed
is
is
that
long
arrow
had
been
trapped
inside
the
mountain
by
falling
rock
he
probably
found
that
beetle
inside
the
many
other
different
beetles
too
eh
he
wouldn
t
have
been
likely
to
take
the
in
with
him
would
he
was
hunting
plants
you
say
not
beetles
isn
t
that
right
yes
said
the
doctor
that
s
probably
very
well
it
is
fair
to
suppose
then
that
the
beetle
s
home
or
his
hole
is
in
that
part
of
the
mountain
where
long
arrow
and
his
party
are
imprisoned
isn
t
it
quite
all
right
then
the
thing
to
do
is
to
let
the
beetle
watch
him
and
sooner
or
later
he
ll
return
to
his
home
in
long
arrow
s
cave
and
there
we
will
follow
at
all
events
she
added
smoothing
down
her
with
a
very
superior
air
we
will
follow
him
till
the
miserable
bug
starts
nosing
under
the
earth
but
at
least
he
will
show
us
what
part
of
the
mountain
long
arrow
is
hidden
but
he
may
fly
if
i
let
him
out
said
the
doctor
then
we
shall
just
lose
him
and
be
no
better
off
than
we
were
him
fly
snorted
polynesia
scornfully
a
parrot
can
wing
it
as
fast
as
a
i
fancy
if
he
takes
to
the
air
i
ll
guarantee
not
to
let
the
little
devil
out
of
my
sight
and
if
he
just
crawls
along
the
ground
you
can
follow
him
splendid
cried
the
doctor
polynesia
you
have
a
great
brain
i
ll
set
him
to
work
at
once
and
see
what
again
we
all
clustered
round
the
doctor
as
he
carefully
lifted
off
the
glass
lid
and
let
the
big
beetle
climb
out
upon
his
finger
ladybug
ladybug
fly
away
home
crooned
bumpo
your
house
is
on
fire
and
your
oh
be
quiet
snapped
polynesia
crossly
stop
insulting
him
don
t
you
suppose
he
has
wits
enough
to
go
home
without
your
telling
him
i
thought
perchance
he
might
be
of
a
philandering
disposition
said
bumpo
humbly
it
could
be
that
he
is
tired
of
his
home
and
needs
to
be
encouraged
shall
i
sing
him
home
sweet
home
think
you
no
then
he
d
never
go
back
your
voice
needs
a
rest
don
t
sing
to
him
just
watch
and
doctor
why
not
tie
another
message
to
the
creature
s
leg
telling
long
arrow
that
we
re
doing
our
best
to
reach
him
and
that
he
mustn
t
give
up
hope
i
will
said
the
doctor
and
in
a
minute
he
had
pulled
a
dry
leaf
from
a
bush
near
by
and
was
covering
it
with
little
pictures
in
pencil
at
last
neatly
fixed
up
with
his
new
jabizri
crawled
off
the
doctor
s
finger
to
the
ground
and
looked
about
him
he
stretched
his
legs
polished
his
nose
with
his
front
feet
and
then
moved
off
leisurely
to
the
westward
we
had
expected
him
to
walk
the
mountain
instead
he
walked
it
do
you
know
how
long
it
takes
a
beetle
to
walk
round
a
mountain
well
i
assure
you
it
takes
an
unbelievably
long
time
as
the
hours
dragged
by
we
hoped
and
hoped
that
he
would
get
up
and
fly
the
rest
and
let
polynesia
carry
on
the
work
of
following
him
but
he
never
opened
his
wings
once
i
had
not
realized
before
how
hard
it
is
for
a
human
being
to
walk
slowly
enough
to
keep
up
with
a
beetle
it
was
the
most
tedious
thing
i
have
ever
gone
through
and
as
we
dawdled
along
behind
watching
him
like
hawks
lest
we
lose
him
under
a
leaf
or
something
we
all
got
so
cross
and
we
were
ready
to
bite
one
another
s
heads
off
and
when
he
stopped
to
look
at
the
scenery
or
polish
his
nose
some
more
i
could
hear
polynesia
behind
me
letting
out
the
most
dreadful
seafaring
you
ever
heard
after
he
had
led
us
the
whole
way
round
the
mountain
he
brought
us
to
the
exact
spot
where
we
started
from
and
there
he
came
to
a
dead
stop
well
said
bumpo
to
polynesia
what
do
you
think
of
the
beetle
s
sense
now
you
see
he
know
enough
to
go
oh
be
still
you
hottentot
snapped
polynesia
wouldn
t
want
to
stretch
your
legs
for
exercise
if
you
d
been
shut
up
in
a
box
all
day
probably
his
home
is
near
here
and
that
s
why
he
s
come
but
why
i
asked
did
he
go
the
whole
way
round
the
mountain
first
then
the
three
of
us
got
into
a
violent
argument
but
in
the
middle
of
it
all
the
doctor
suddenly
called
out
look
look
we
turned
and
found
that
he
was
pointing
to
the
jabizri
who
was
now
walking
the
mountain
at
a
much
faster
and
more
gait
well
said
bumpo
sitting
down
wearily
if
he
is
going
to
walk
the
mountain
and
back
for
more
exercise
i
ll
wait
for
him
here
and
polynesia
can
follow
indeed
it
would
have
taken
a
monkey
or
a
bird
to
climb
the
place
which
the
beetle
was
now
walking
up
it
was
a
smooth
flat
part
of
the
mountain
s
side
steep
as
a
wall
but
presently
when
the
jabizri
was
no
more
than
ten
feet
above
our
heads
we
all
cried
out
together
for
even
while
we
watched
him
he
had
disappeared
into
the
face
of
the
rock
like
a
raindrop
soaking
into
sand
he
s
gone
cried
polynesia
there
must
be
a
hole
up
and
in
a
twinkling
she
had
fluttered
up
the
rock
and
was
clinging
to
the
face
of
it
with
her
claws
yes
she
shouted
down
we
ve
run
him
to
earth
at
last
his
hole
is
right
here
behind
a
patch
of
enough
to
get
two
fingers
ah
cried
the
doctor
this
great
slab
of
rock
then
must
have
slid
down
from
the
summit
and
shut
off
the
mouth
of
the
cave
like
a
door
poor
fellows
what
a
dreadful
time
they
must
have
spent
in
there
if
we
only
had
some
picks
and
shovels
now
picks
and
shovels
wouldn
t
do
much
good
said
polynesia
look
at
the
size
of
the
slab
a
hundred
feet
high
and
as
many
broad
you
would
need
an
army
for
a
week
to
make
any
impression
on
i
wonder
how
thick
it
is
said
the
doctor
and
he
picked
up
a
big
stone
and
banged
it
with
all
his
might
against
the
face
of
the
rock
it
made
a
hollow
booming
sound
like
a
giant
drum
we
all
stood
still
listening
while
the
echo
of
it
died
slowly
away
and
then
a
cold
shiver
ran
down
my
spine
for
from
within
the
mountain
back
came
three
answering
knocks
boom
boom
we
looked
at
one
another
as
though
the
earth
itself
had
spoken
and
the
solemn
little
silence
that
followed
was
broken
by
the
doctor
thank
heaven
he
said
in
a
hushed
reverent
voice
some
of
them
at
least
are
alive
part
five
first
a
great
moment
the
next
part
of
our
problem
was
the
hardest
of
all
how
to
roll
aside
pull
down
or
break
open
that
gigantic
slab
as
we
gazed
up
at
it
towering
above
our
heads
it
looked
indeed
a
hopeless
task
for
our
tiny
strength
but
the
sounds
of
life
from
inside
the
mountain
had
put
new
heart
in
us
and
in
a
moment
we
were
all
scrambling
around
trying
to
find
any
opening
or
crevice
which
would
give
us
something
to
work
on
scaled
up
the
sheer
wall
of
the
slab
and
examined
the
top
of
it
where
it
leaned
against
the
mountain
s
side
i
uprooted
bushes
and
stripped
off
hanging
creepers
that
might
conceal
a
weak
place
the
doctor
got
more
leaves
and
composed
new
for
the
jabizri
to
take
in
if
he
should
turn
up
again
whilst
polynesia
carried
up
a
handful
of
nuts
and
pushed
them
into
the
beetle
s
hole
one
by
one
for
the
prisoners
inside
to
eat
nuts
are
so
nourishing
she
said
but
jip
it
was
who
scratching
at
the
foot
of
the
slab
like
a
good
ratter
made
the
discovery
which
led
to
our
final
success
doctor
he
cried
running
up
to
john
dolittle
with
his
nose
all
covered
with
black
mud
this
slab
is
resting
on
nothing
but
a
bed
of
soft
earth
you
never
saw
such
easy
digging
i
guess
the
cave
behind
must
be
just
too
high
up
for
the
indians
to
reach
the
earth
with
their
hands
or
they
could
have
scraped
a
way
out
long
ago
if
we
can
only
scratch
the
away
from
under
the
slab
might
drop
a
little
then
maybe
the
indians
can
climb
out
over
the
the
doctor
hurried
to
examine
the
place
where
jip
had
dug
why
yes
he
said
if
we
can
get
the
earth
away
from
under
this
front
edge
the
slab
is
standing
up
so
straight
we
might
even
make
it
fall
right
down
in
this
direction
it
s
well
worth
trying
let
s
get
at
it
we
had
no
tools
but
the
sticks
and
slivers
of
stone
which
we
could
find
around
a
strange
sight
we
must
have
looked
the
whole
crew
of
us
squatting
down
on
our
heels
scratching
and
burrowing
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
like
six
badgers
in
a
row
after
about
an
hour
during
which
in
spite
of
the
cold
the
sweat
fell
from
our
foreheads
in
all
directions
the
doctor
said
be
ready
to
jump
from
under
clear
out
of
the
way
if
she
shows
signs
of
moving
if
this
slab
falls
on
anybody
it
will
squash
him
flatter
than
a
presently
there
was
a
grating
grinding
sound
look
out
yelled
john
dolittle
here
she
comes
we
ran
for
our
lives
outwards
toward
the
sides
the
big
rock
slid
gently
down
about
a
foot
into
the
trough
which
we
had
made
beneath
it
for
a
moment
i
was
disappointed
for
like
that
it
was
as
hopeless
as
signs
of
a
showing
above
it
but
as
i
looked
upward
i
saw
the
top
coming
very
slowly
away
from
the
mountainside
we
had
unbalanced
it
below
as
it
moved
apart
from
the
face
of
the
mountain
sounds
of
human
voices
crying
gladly
in
a
strange
tongue
issued
from
behind
faster
and
faster
the
top
swung
forward
downward
then
with
a
roaring
crash
which
shook
the
whole
beneath
our
feet
it
struck
the
earth
and
cracked
in
halves
how
can
i
describe
to
any
one
that
first
meeting
between
the
two
greatest
naturalists
the
world
ever
knew
long
arrow
the
son
of
golden
arrow
and
john
dolittle
of
the
scene
rises
before
me
now
plain
and
clear
in
every
detail
though
it
took
place
so
many
many
years
ago
but
when
i
come
to
write
of
it
words
seem
such
poor
things
with
which
to
tell
you
of
that
great
occasion
i
know
that
the
doctor
whose
life
was
surely
full
enough
of
big
happenings
always
counted
the
setting
free
of
the
indian
scientist
as
the
greatest
thing
he
ever
did
for
my
part
knowing
how
much
this
meeting
must
mean
to
him
i
was
on
pins
and
needles
of
expectation
and
curiosity
as
the
great
stone
finally
thundered
down
at
our
feet
and
we
gazed
across
it
to
see
what
lay
behind
the
gloomy
black
mouth
of
a
tunnel
full
twenty
feet
high
was
revealed
in
the
centre
of
this
opening
stood
an
enormous
red
indian
seven
feet
tall
handsome
muscular
slim
and
for
a
beaded
cloth
about
his
middle
and
an
eagle
s
feather
in
his
hair
he
held
one
hand
across
his
face
to
shield
his
eyes
from
the
blinding
sun
which
he
had
not
seen
in
many
days
it
is
he
i
heard
the
doctor
whisper
at
my
elbow
i
know
him
by
his
great
height
and
the
scar
upon
his
and
he
stepped
forward
slowly
across
the
fallen
stone
with
his
hand
outstretched
to
the
red
man
presently
the
indian
uncovered
his
eyes
and
i
saw
that
they
had
a
curious
piercing
gleam
in
the
eyes
of
an
eagle
but
kinder
and
more
gentle
he
slowly
raised
his
right
arm
the
rest
of
him
still
and
motionless
like
a
statue
and
took
the
doctor
s
hand
in
his
it
was
a
great
moment
polynesia
nodded
to
me
in
a
knowing
satisfied
kind
of
way
and
i
heard
old
bumpo
sniffle
sentimentally
then
the
doctor
tried
to
speak
to
long
arrow
but
the
indian
knew
no
english
of
course
and
the
doctor
knew
no
indian
presently
to
my
surprise
i
heard
the
doctor
trying
him
in
different

it
was
a
great
moment
how
do
you
do
he
said
in
i
am
glad
to
see
you
in
how
long
have
you
been
buried
in
still
the
indian
made
no
move
but
stood
there
straight
and
stiff
understanding
not
a
word
the
doctor
tried
again
in
several
other
animal
dialects
but
with
no
result
till
at
last
he
came
to
the
language
of
eagles
great
he
said
in
the
fierce
screams
and
short
grunts
that
the
big
birds
use
never
have
i
been
so
glad
in
all
my
life
as
i
am
to
find
you
still
in
a
flash
long
arrow
s
stony
face
lit
up
with
a
smile
of
understanding
and
back
came
the
answer
in
mighty
white
man
i
owe
my
life
to
you
for
the
remainder
of
my
days
i
am
your
servant
to
afterwards
long
arrow
told
us
that
this
was
the
only
bird
or
animal
language
that
he
had
ever
been
able
to
learn
but
that
he
had
not
spoken
it
in
a
long
time
for
no
eagles
ever
came
to
this
island
then
the
doctor
signaled
to
bumpo
who
came
forward
with
the
nuts
and
water
but
long
arrow
neither
ate
nor
drank
taking
the
supplies
with
a
nod
of
thanks
he
turned
and
carried
them
into
the
inner
dimness
of
the
cave
we
followed
him
inside
we
found
nine
other
indians
men
women
and
boys
lying
on
the
rock
floor
in
a
dreadful
state
of
thinness
and
exhaustion
some
had
their
eyes
closed
as
if
dead
quickly
the
doctor
went
round
them
all
and
listened
to
their
hearts
they
were
all
alive
but
one
woman
was
too
weak
even
to
stand
upon
her
feet
at
a
word
from
the
doctor
and
polynesia
sped
off
into
the
jungles
after
more
fruit
and
water
while
long
arrow
was
handing
round
what
food
we
had
to
his
starving
friends
we
suddenly
heard
a
sound
outside
the
cave
turning
about
we
saw
clustered
at
the
entrance
the
band
of
indians
who
had
met
us
so
inhospitably
at
the
beach
they
peered
into
the
dark
cave
cautiously
at
first
but
as
soon
as
they
saw
long
arrow
and
the
other
indians
with
us
they
came
rushing
in
laughing
clapping
their
hands
with
joy
and
jabbering
away
at
a
tremendous
rate
long
arrow
explained
to
the
doctor
that
the
nine
indians
we
had
found
in
the
cave
with
him
were
two
families
who
had
accompanied
him
into
the
mountains
to
help
him
gather
and
while
they
had
been
searching
for
a
kind
of
for
grows
only
inside
of
damp
caves
the
great
rock
slab
had
slid
down
and
shut
them
in
then
for
two
weeks
they
had
lived
on
the
and
such
fresh
water
as
could
be
found
dripping
from
the
damp
walls
of
the
cave
the
other
indians
on
the
island
had
given
them
up
for
lost
and
mourned
them
as
dead
and
they
were
now
very
surprised
and
happy
to
find
their
relatives
alive
when
long
arrow
turned
to
the
newcomers
and
told
them
in
their
own
language
that
it
was
the
white
man
who
had
found
and
freed
their
relatives
they
gathered
round
john
dolittle
all
talking
at
once
and
beating
their
breasts
long
arrow
said
they
were
apologizing
and
trying
to
tell
the
doctor
how
sorry
they
were
that
they
had
seemed
unfriendly
to
him
at
the
beach
they
had
never
seen
a
white
man
before
and
had
really
been
afraid
of
when
they
saw
him
conversing
with
the
porpoises
they
had
thought
he
was
the
devil
they
said
then
they
went
outside
and
looked
at
the
great
stone
we
had
thrown
down
big
as
a
meadow
and
they
walked
round
and
round
it
pointing
to
the
break
running
through
the
middle
and
wondering
how
the
trick
of
felling
it
was
done
travelers
who
have
since
visited
spidermonkey
island
tell
me
that
that
huge
stone
slab
is
now
one
of
the
regular
sights
of
the
island
and
that
the
indian
guides
when
showing
it
to
visitors
always
tell
story
of
how
it
came
there
they
say
that
when
the
doctor
found
that
the
rocks
had
entrapped
his
friend
long
arrow
he
was
so
angry
that
he
ripped
the
mountain
in
halves
with
his
bare
hands
and
let
him
out
second
the
men
of
the
moving
land
from
that
time
on
the
indians
treatment
of
us
was
very
different
we
were
invited
to
their
village
for
a
feast
to
celebrate
the
recovery
of
the
lost
families
and
after
we
had
made
a
litter
from
saplings
to
carry
the
sick
woman
in
we
all
started
off
down
the
mountain
on
the
way
the
indians
told
long
arrow
something
which
appeared
to
be
sad
news
for
on
hearing
it
his
face
grew
very
grave
the
doctor
asked
him
what
was
wrong
and
long
arrow
said
he
had
just
been
informed
that
the
chief
of
the
tribe
an
old
man
of
eighty
had
died
early
that
morning
that
polynesia
whispered
in
my
ear
must
have
been
what
they
went
back
to
the
village
for
when
the
messenger
fetched
them
from
the
what
did
he
die
of
asked
the
doctor
he
died
of
cold
said
long
arrow
indeed
now
that
the
sun
was
setting
we
were
all
shivering
ourselves
this
is
a
serious
thing
said
the
doctor
to
me
the
island
is
still
in
the
grip
of
that
wretched
current
flowing
southward
we
will
have
to
look
into
this
if
nothing
can
be
done
about
it
the
indians
had
better
take
to
canoes
and
leave
the
island
the
chance
of
being
wrecked
will
be
better
than
getting
frozen
to
death
in
the
of
the
presently
we
came
over
a
saddle
in
the
hills
and
looking
downward
on
the
far
side
of
the
island
we
saw
the
large
cluster
of
grass
huts
and
gaily
colored
close
by
the
edge
of
the
sea
how
artistic
said
the
delightfully
situated
what
is
the
name
of
the
village
popsipetel
said
long
arrow
that
is
the
name
also
of
the
tribe
the
word
signifies
in
indian
tongue
men
of
the
moving
there
are
two
tribes
of
indians
on
the
island
the
popsipetels
at
this
end
and
the
at
the
which
is
the
larger
of
the
two
peoples
the
by
far
their
city
covers
two
square
leagues
but
added
long
arrow
a
slight
frown
darkening
his
handsome
face
for
me
i
would
rather
have
one
popsipetel
than
a
hundred
the
news
of
the
rescue
we
had
made
had
evidently
gone
ahead
of
us
for
as
we
drew
nearer
to
the
village
we
saw
crowds
of
indians
streaming
out
to
greet
the
friends
and
relatives
whom
they
had
never
thought
to
see
again
these
good
people
when
they
too
were
told
how
the
rescue
had
been
the
work
of
the
strange
white
visitor
to
their
shores
all
gathered
round
the
doctor
shook
him
by
the
hands
patted
him
and
hugged
him
then
they
lifted
him
up
upon
their
strong
shoulders
and
carried
him
down
the
hill
into
the
village
there
the
welcome
we
received
was
even
more
wonderful
in
spite
of
the
cold
air
of
the
coming
night
the
villagers
who
had
all
been
shivering
within
their
houses
threw
open
their
doors
and
came
out
in
hundreds
i
had
no
idea
that
the
little
village
could
hold
so
many
they
thronged
about
us
smiling
and
nodding
and
waving
their
hands
and
as
the
details
of
what
we
had
done
were
recited
by
long
arrow
they
kept
shouting
strange
singing
noises
which
we
supposed
were
words
of
gratitude
or
praise
we
were
next
escorted
to
a
grass
house
clean
and
within
and
informed
that
it
was
ours
six
strong
indian
boys
were
told
off
to
be
our
servants
on
our
way
through
the
village
we
noticed
a
house
larger
than
the
rest
standing
at
the
end
of
the
main
street
long
arrow
pointed
to
it
and
told
us
it
was
the
chief
s
house
but
that
it
was
now
new
chief
having
yet
been
elected
to
take
the
place
of
the
old
one
who
had
died
inside
our
new
home
a
feast
of
fish
and
fruit
had
been
prepared
most
of
the
more
important
men
of
the
tribe
were
already
seating
themselves
at
the
long
when
we
got
there
long
arrow
invited
us
to
sit
down
and
eat
this
we
were
glad
enough
to
do
as
we
were
all
hungry
but
we
were
both
surprised
and
disappointed
when
we
found
that
the
fish
had
not
been
cooked
the
indians
did
not
seem
to
think
this
extraordinary
in
the
least
but
went
ahead
gobbling
the
fish
with
much
relish
the
way
it
was
raw
with
many
apologies
the
doctor
explained
to
long
arrow
that
if
they
had
no
objection
we
would
prefer
our
fish
cooked
imagine
our
astonishment
when
we
found
that
the
great
long
arrow
so
learned
in
the
natural
sciences
did
not
know
what
the
word
meant
polynesia
who
was
sitting
on
the
bench
between
john
dolittle
and
myself
pulled
the
doctor
by
the
sleeve
i
ll
tell
you
what
s
wrong
doctor
she
whispered
as
he
leant
down
to
listen
to
her
people
have
no
they
don
t
know
how
to
make
a
fire
look
outside
it
s
almost
dark
and
there
isn
t
a
light
showing
in
the
whole
village
this
is
a
fireless
third
fire
then
the
doctor
asked
long
arrow
if
he
knew
what
fire
was
explaining
it
to
him
by
pictures
drawn
on
the
buckskin
long
arrow
said
he
had
seen
such
a
out
of
the
tops
of
volcanoes
but
that
neither
he
nor
any
of
the
popsipetels
knew
how
it
was
made
poor
perishing
heathens
muttered
bumpo
no
wonder
the
old
chief
died
of
cold
at
that
moment
we
heard
a
crying
sound
at
the
door
and
turning
round
we
saw
a
weeping
indian
mother
with
a
baby
in
her
arms
she
said
something
to
the
indians
which
we
could
not
understand
and
long
arrow
told
us
the
baby
was
sick
and
she
wanted
the
white
doctor
to
try
and
cure
it
oh
lord
groaned
polynesia
in
my
just
like
puddleby
patients
arriving
in
the
middle
of
dinner
well
one
thing
the
food
s
raw
so
nothing
can
get
cold
the
doctor
examined
the
baby
and
found
at
once
that
it
was
thoroughly
chilled
that
s
what
it
needs
he
said
turning
to
long
that
s
what
you
all
need
this
child
will
have
pneumonia
if
it
isn
t
kept
aye
truly
but
how
to
make
a
fire
said
long
where
to
get
it
that
is
the
difficulty
all
the
volcanoes
in
this
land
are
then
we
fell
to
hunting
through
our
pockets
to
see
if
any
matches
had
survived
the
shipwreck
the
best
we
could
muster
were
two
whole
ones
and
a
with
the
heads
soaked
off
them
by
salt
water
hark
long
arrow
said
the
doctor
divers
ways
there
be
of
making
fire
without
the
aid
of
matches
one
with
a
strong
glass
and
the
rays
of
the
sun
that
however
since
the
sun
has
set
we
can
not
now
employ
another
is
by
grinding
a
hard
stick
into
a
soft
the
daylight
gone
without
yes
then
i
fear
we
must
await
the
morrow
for
besides
the
different
woods
we
need
an
old
squirrel
s
nest
for
that
without
lamps
you
could
not
find
in
your
forests
at
this
great
are
your
cunning
and
your
skill
oh
white
man
long
arrow
replied
but
in
this
you
do
us
an
injustice
know
you
not
that
all
fireless
peoples
can
see
in
the
dark
having
no
lamps
we
are
forced
to
train
ourselves
to
travel
through
the
blackest
night
lightless
i
will
despatch
a
messenger
and
you
shall
have
your
squirrel
s
nest
within
the
he
gave
an
order
to
two
of
our
who
promptly
disappeared
running
and
sure
enough
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
a
squirrel
s
nest
together
with
hard
and
soft
woods
was
brought
to
our
door
the
moon
had
not
yet
risen
and
within
the
house
it
was
practically
i
could
feel
and
hear
however
that
the
indians
were
moving
about
comfortably
as
though
it
were
daylight
the
task
of
making
fire
the
doctor
had
to
perform
almost
entirely
by
the
sense
of
touch
asking
long
arrow
and
the
indians
to
hand
him
his
tools
when
he
mislaid
them
in
the
dark
and
then
i
made
a
curious
discovery
now
that
i
had
to
i
found
that
i
was
beginning
to
see
a
little
in
the
dark
myself
and
for
the
first
time
i
realized
that
of
course
there
no
such
thing
as
so
long
as
you
have
a
door
open
or
a
sky
above
you
calling
for
the
loan
of
a
bow
the
doctor
loosened
the
string
put
the
hard
stick
into
a
loop
and
began
grinding
this
stick
into
the
soft
wood
of
the
log
soon
i
smelt
that
the
log
was
smoking
then
he
kept
feeding
the
part
that
was
smoking
with
the
inside
lining
of
the
squirrel
s
nest
and
he
asked
me
to
blow
upon
it
with
my
breath
he
made
the
stick
drill
faster
and
faster
more
smoke
filled
the
room
and
at
last
the
darkness
about
us
was
suddenly
lit
up
the
squirrel
s
nest
had
burst
into
flame
the
indians
murmured
and
grunted
with
astonishment
at
first
they
were
all
for
falling
on
their
knees
and
worshiping
the
fire
then
they
wanted
to
pick
it
up
with
their
bare
hands
and
play
with
it
we
had
to
teach
them
how
it
was
to
be
used
and
they
were
quite
fascinated
when
we
laid
our
fish
across
it
on
sticks
and
cooked
it
they
sniffed
the
air
with
relish
as
for
the
first
time
in
history
the
smell
of
fried
fish
passed
through
the
village
of
popsipetel
then
we
got
them
to
bring
us
piles
and
stacks
of
dry
wood
and
we
made
an
enormous
bonfire
in
the
middle
of
the
main
street
round
this
when
they
felt
its
warmth
the
whole
tribe
gathered
and
smiled
and
wondered
it
was
a
striking
sight
one
of
the
pictures
from
our
voyages
that
i
most
frequently
remember
that
roaring
jolly
blaze
beneath
the
black
night
sky
and
all
about
it
a
vast
ring
of
indians
the
firelight
gleaming
on
bronze
cheeks
white
teeth
and
flashing
whole
town
trying
to
get
warm
giggling
and
pushing
like
in
a
little
when
we
had
got
them
more
used
to
the
handling
of
fire
the
doctor
showed
them
how
it
could
be
taken
into
their
houses
if
a
hole
were
only
made
in
the
roof
to
let
the
smoke
out
and
before
we
turned
in
after
that
long
long
tiring
day
we
had
fires
going
in
every
hut
in
the
village
the
poor
people
were
so
glad
to
get
really
warm
again
that
we
thought
they
d
never
go
to
bed
well
on
into
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
the
little
town
fairly
buzzed
with
a
great
low
murmur
the
popsipetels
sitting
up
talking
of
their
wonderful
visitor
and
this
strange
good
thing
he
had
brought
with
fourth
what
makes
an
island
float
very
early
in
our
experience
of
popsipetel
kindness
we
saw
that
if
we
were
to
get
anything
done
at
all
we
would
almost
always
have
to
do
it
secretly
the
doctor
was
so
popular
and
loved
by
all
that
as
soon
as
he
showed
his
face
at
his
door
in
the
morning
crowds
of
admirers
waiting
patiently
outside
flocked
about
him
and
followed
him
wherever
he
went
after
his
feat
this
childlike
people
expected
him
i
think
to
be
continually
doing
magic
and
they
were
determined
not
to
miss
a
trick
it
was
only
with
great
difficulty
that
we
escaped
from
the
crowd
the
first
morning
and
set
out
with
long
arrow
to
explore
the
island
at
our
leisure
in
the
interior
we
found
that
not
only
the
plants
and
trees
were
suffering
from
the
cold
the
animal
life
was
in
even
worse
straits
everywhere
shivering
birds
were
to
be
seen
their
feathers
all
fluffed
out
gathering
together
for
flight
to
summer
lands
and
many
lay
dead
upon
the
ground
going
down
to
the
shore
we
watched
in
large
numbers
taking
to
the
sea
to
find
some
better
home
while
away
to
the
southeast
we
could
see
many
icebergs
sign
that
we
were
now
not
far
from
the
terrible
region
of
the
antarctic
as
we
were
looking
out
to
sea
we
noticed
our
friends
the
porpoises
jumping
through
the
waves
the
doctor
hailed
them
and
they
came
inshore
he
asked
them
how
far
we
were
from
the
south
polar
continent
about
a
hundred
miles
they
told
him
and
then
they
asked
why
he
wanted
to
know
because
this
floating
island
we
are
on
said
he
is
drifting
southward
all
the
time
in
a
current
it
s
an
island
that
ordinarily
belongs
somewhere
in
the
tropic
sultry
weather
sunstrokes
and
all
that
if
it
doesn
t
stop
going
southward
pretty
soon
everything
on
it
is
going
to
well
said
the
porpoises
then
the
thing
to
do
is
to
get
it
back
into
a
warmer
climate
isn
t
it
yes
but
how
said
the
doctor
we
can
t
it
no
said
they
but
whales
could
push
you
only
got
enough
of
what
a
splendid
idea
the
very
thing
said
the
doctor
do
you
think
you
could
get
me
some
why
certainly
said
the
porpoises
we
passed
one
herd
of
them
out
there
sporting
about
among
the
icebergs
we
ll
ask
them
to
come
over
and
if
they
aren
t
enough
we
ll
try
and
hunt
up
some
more
better
have
thank
you
said
the
doctor
you
are
very
the
way
do
you
happen
to
know
how
this
island
came
to
be
a
floating
island
at
least
half
of
it
i
notice
is
made
of
stone
it
is
very
odd
that
it
floats
at
all
isn
t
it
it
is
unusual
they
said
but
the
explanation
is
quite
simple
it
used
to
be
a
mountainous
part
of
south
overhanging
of
an
awkward
corner
you
might
say
way
back
in
the
glacial
days
thousands
of
years
ago
it
broke
off
from
the
mainland
and
by
some
curious
accident
the
inside
of
it
which
is
hollow
got
filled
with
air
as
it
fell
into
the
ocean
you
can
only
see
less
than
half
of
the
island
the
bigger
half
is
under
water
and
in
the
middle
of
it
underneath
is
a
huge
rock
running
right
up
inside
the
mountains
and
that
s
what
keeps
it
what
a
pecurious
phenometer
said
bumpo
it
is
indeed
said
the
doctor
i
must
make
a
note
of
and
out
came
the
everlasting
the
porpoises
went
bounding
off
towards
the
icebergs
and
not
long
after
we
saw
the
sea
heaving
and
frothing
as
a
big
herd
of
whales
came
towards
us
at
full
speed
they
certainly
were
enormous
creatures
and
there
must
have
been
a
good
two
hundred
of
them
here
they
are
said
the
porpoises
poking
their
heads
out
of
the
water
good
said
the
doctor
now
just
explain
to
them
will
you
please
that
this
is
a
very
serious
matter
for
all
the
living
creatures
in
this
land
and
ask
them
if
they
will
be
so
good
as
to
go
down
to
the
far
end
of
the
island
put
their
noses
against
it
and
push
it
back
near
the
coast
of
southern
the
porpoises
evidently
succeeded
in
persuading
the
whales
to
do
as
the
doctor
asked
for
presently
we
saw
them
thrashing
through
the
seas
going
off
towards
the
south
end
of
the
island
then
we
lay
down
upon
the
beach
and
waited
after
about
an
hour
the
doctor
got
up
and
threw
a
stick
into
the
water
for
a
while
this
floated
motionless
but
soon
we
saw
it
begin
to
move
gently
down
the
coast
ah
said
the
doctor
see
that
island
is
going
north
at
last
thank
goodness
faster
and
faster
we
left
the
stick
behind
and
smaller
and
dimmer
grew
the
icebergs
on
the
skyline
the
doctor
took
out
his
watch
threw
more
sticks
into
the
water
and
made
a
rapid
calculation
humph
and
a
half
knots
an
hour
he
a
very
nice
speed
it
should
take
us
about
five
days
to
get
back
near
brazil
well
that
s
a
load
off
my
mind
i
declare
i
feel
warmer
already
let
s
go
and
get
something
to
fifth
war
on
our
way
back
to
the
village
the
doctor
began
discussing
natural
history
with
long
arrow
but
their
most
interesting
talk
mainly
about
plants
had
hardly
begun
when
an
indian
runner
came
dashing
up
to
us
with
a
message
long
arrow
listened
gravely
to
the
breathless
babbled
words
then
turned
to
the
doctor
and
said
in
eagle
tongue
great
white
man
an
evil
thing
has
befallen
the
popsipetels
our
neighbors
to
the
southward
the
thievish
who
for
so
long
have
cast
envious
eyes
on
our
stores
of
ripe
corn
have
gone
upon
the
and
even
now
are
advancing
to
attack
evil
news
indeed
said
the
doctor
yet
let
us
not
judge
harshly
perhaps
it
is
that
they
are
desperate
for
food
having
their
own
crops
before
harvest
for
are
they
not
even
nearer
the
cold
south
than
you
make
no
excuses
for
any
man
of
the
tribe
of
the
said
long
arrow
shaking
his
head
they
are
an
idle
shiftless
race
they
do
but
see
a
chance
to
get
corn
without
the
labor
of
husbandry
if
it
were
not
that
they
are
a
much
bigger
tribe
and
hope
to
defeat
their
neighbor
by
sheer
force
of
numbers
they
would
not
have
dared
to
make
open
war
upon
the
brave
when
we
reached
the
village
we
found
it
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
everywhere
men
were
seen
putting
their
bows
in
order
sharpening
spears
grinding
and
making
arrows
by
the
hundred
women
were
raising
a
high
fence
of
bamboo
poles
all
round
the
village
scouts
and
messengers
kept
coming
and
going
bringing
news
of
the
movements
of
the
enemy
while
high
up
in
the
trees
and
hills
about
the
village
we
could
see
watching
the
mountains
to
the
southward
long
arrow
brought
another
indian
short
but
enormously
broad
and
introduced
him
to
the
doctor
as
big
teeth
the
chief
warrior
of
the
popsipetels
the
doctor
volunteered
to
go
and
see
the
enemy
and
try
to
argue
the
matter
out
peacefully
with
them
instead
of
fighting
for
war
he
said
was
at
best
a
stupid
wasteful
business
but
the
two
shook
their
heads
such
a
plan
was
hopeless
they
said
in
the
last
war
when
they
had
sent
a
messenger
to
do
peaceful
arguing
the
enemy
had
merely
hit
him
with
an
ax
while
the
doctor
was
asking
big
teeth
how
he
meant
to
defend
the
village
against
attack
a
cry
of
alarm
was
raised
by
the
they
re
coming
down
the
mountains
in
thousands
well
said
the
doctor
it
s
all
in
the
day
s
work
i
suppose
i
don
t
believe
in
war
but
if
the
village
is
attacked
we
must
help
defend
and
he
picked
up
a
club
from
the
ground
and
tried
the
heft
of
it
against
a
stone
this
he
said
seems
like
a
pretty
good
tool
to
and
he
walked
to
the
bamboo
fence
and
took
his
place
among
the
other
waiting
fighters
then
we
all
got
hold
of
some
kind
of
weapon
with
which
to
help
our
friends
the
gallant
popsipetels
i
borrowed
a
bow
and
a
quiver
full
of
arrows
jip
was
content
to
rely
upon
his
old
but
still
strong
teeth
took
a
bag
of
rocks
and
climbed
a
palm
where
he
could
throw
them
down
upon
the
enemies
heads
and
bumpo
marched
after
the
doctor
to
the
fence
armed
with
a
young
tree
in
one
hand
and
a
in
the
other
when
the
enemy
drew
near
enough
to
be
seen
from
where
we
stood
we
all
gasped
with
astonishment
the
hillsides
were
actually
covered
with
upon
thousands
they
made
our
small
army
within
the
village
look
like
a
mere
handful
saints
alive
muttered
polynesia
our
little
lot
will
stand
no
chance
against
that
swarm
this
will
never
do
i
m
going
off
to
get
some
where
she
was
going
and
what
kind
of
help
she
meant
to
get
i
had
no
idea
she
just
disappeared
from
my
side
but
jip
who
had
heard
her
poked
his
nose
between
the
bamboo
bars
of
the
fence
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
enemy
and
said
likely
enough
she
s
gone
after
the
black
parrots
let
s
hope
she
finds
them
in
time
just
look
at
those
ugly
ruffians
climbing
down
the
of
em
this
fight
s
going
to
keep
us
all
and
jip
was
right
before
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
gone
by
our
village
was
completely
surrounded
by
one
huge
mob
of
yelling
raging
i
now
come
again
to
a
part
in
the
story
of
our
voyages
where
things
happened
so
quickly
one
upon
the
other
that
looking
backwards
i
see
the
picture
only
in
a
confused
kind
of
way
i
know
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
terrible
they
came
afterwards
to
be
fondly
called
in
popsipetel
arrow
bumpo
and
the
doctor
the
war
would
have
been
soon
over
and
the
whole
island
would
have
belonged
to
the
worthless
but
the
englishman
the
african
and
the
indian
were
a
regiment
in
themselves
and
between
them
they
made
that
village
a
dangerous
place
for
any
man
to
try
to
enter
the
bamboo
fencing
which
had
been
hastily
set
up
around
the
town
was
not
a
very
strong
affair
and
right
from
the
start
it
gave
way
in
one
place
after
another
as
the
enemy
thronged
and
crowded
against
it
then
the
doctor
long
arrow
and
bumpo
would
hurry
to
the
weak
spot
a
terrific
fight
would
take
place
and
the
enemy
be
thrown
out
but
almost
instantly
a
cry
of
alarm
would
come
from
some
other
part
of
the
and
the
three
would
have
to
rush
off
and
do
the
same
thing
all
over
again
illustration
the
terrible
three
an
indian
found
on
hawks
mountain
spidermonkey
the
popsipetels
were
themselves
no
mean
fighters
but
the
strength
and
weight
of
those
three
men
of
different
lands
and
colors
standing
close
together
swinging
their
enormous
was
really
a
sight
for
the
wonder
and
admiration
of
any
one
many
weeks
later
when
i
was
passing
an
indian
at
night
i
heard
this
song
being
sung
it
has
since
become
one
of
the
traditional
folksongs
of
the
popsipetels
the
song
of
the
terrible
three
oh
hear
ye
the
song
of
the
terrible
three
and
the
fight
that
they
fought
by
the
edge
of
the
sea
down
from
the
mountains
the
rocks
and
the
crags
swarming
like
wasps
came
the
surrounding
our
village
our
walls
they
broke
down
oh
sad
was
the
plight
of
our
men
and
our
town
but
heaven
determined
our
land
to
set
free
and
sent
us
the
help
of
the
terrible
three
one
was
a
was
dark
as
the
night
one
was
a
a
mountain
of
height
but
the
chief
was
a
white
man
round
like
a
bee
and
all
in
a
row
stood
the
terrible
three
shoulder
to
shoulder
they
hammered
and
hit
like
demons
of
fury
they
kicked
and
they
bit
like
a
wall
of
destruction
they
stood
in
a
row
flattening
enemies
six
at
a
blow
oh
strong
was
the
fierce
was
the
black
trembled
and
tried
to
turn
back
but
twas
of
the
white
man
they
shouted
beware
he
throws
men
in
handfuls
straight
up
in
the
air
long
shall
they
frighten
bad
children
at
night
with
tales
of
the
red
and
the
black
and
the
white
and
long
shall
we
sing
of
the
terrible
three
and
the
fight
that
they
fought
by
the
edge
of
the
sea
sixth
general
polynesia
but
alas
even
the
three
mighty
though
they
were
could
not
last
forever
against
an
army
which
seemed
to
have
no
end
in
one
of
the
hottest
scrimmages
when
the
enemy
had
broken
a
particularly
wide
hole
through
the
fence
i
saw
long
arrow
s
great
figure
topple
and
come
down
with
a
spear
sticking
in
his
broad
chest
for
another
bumpo
and
the
doctor
fought
on
side
by
side
how
their
strength
held
out
so
long
i
can
not
tell
for
never
a
second
were
they
given
to
get
their
breath
or
rest
their
arms
the
quiet
kindly
peaceable
little
doctor
you
wouldn
t
have
known
him
if
you
had
seen
him
that
day
dealing
out
whacks
you
could
hear
a
mile
off
walloping
and
swatting
in
all
directions
as
for
bumpo
with
staring
and
grim
set
teeth
he
was
a
veritable
demon
none
dared
come
within
yards
of
that
wicked
but
a
stone
skilfully
thrown
struck
him
at
last
in
the
centre
of
the
forehead
and
down
went
the
second
of
the
three
john
dolittle
the
last
of
the
terribles
was
left
fighting
alone
jip
and
i
rushed
to
his
side
and
tried
to
take
the
places
of
the
fallen
ones
but
far
too
light
and
too
small
we
made
but
a
poor
exchange
another
length
of
the
fence
crashed
down
and
through
the
widened
gap
the
poured
in
on
us
like
a
flood
to
the
canoes
the
sea
shouted
the
popsipetels
fly
for
your
lives
is
over
war
is
lost
but
the
doctor
and
i
never
got
a
chance
to
fly
for
our
lives
we
were
swept
off
our
feet
and
knocked
down
flat
by
the
sheer
weight
of
the
mob
and
once
down
we
were
unable
to
get
up
again
i
thought
we
would
surely
be
trampled
to
death
but
at
that
moment
above
the
din
and
racket
of
the
battle
we
heard
the
most
terrifying
noise
that
ever
assaulted
human
ears
the
sound
of
millions
and
millions
of
parrots
all
screeching
with
fury
together
the
army
which
in
the
nick
of
time
polynesia
had
brought
to
our
rescue
darkened
the
whole
sky
to
the
westward
i
asked
her
afterwards
how
many
birds
there
were
and
she
said
she
didn
t
know
exactly
but
that
they
certainly
numbered
somewhere
between
sixty
and
seventy
millions
in
that
extraordinarily
short
space
of
time
she
had
brought
them
from
the
mainland
of
south
america
if
you
have
ever
heard
a
parrot
screech
with
anger
you
will
know
that
it
makes
a
truly
frightful
sound
and
if
you
have
ever
been
bitten
by
one
you
will
know
that
its
bite
can
be
a
nasty
and
a
painful
thing
the
black
parrots
all
over
they
for
a
scarlet
beak
and
a
streak
of
red
in
wing
and
tail
on
the
word
of
command
from
polynesia
set
to
work
upon
the
who
were
now
pouring
through
the
village
looking
for
plunder
and
the
black
parrots
method
of
fighting
was
peculiar
this
is
what
they
did
on
the
head
of
each
three
or
four
parrots
settled
and
took
a
good
in
his
hair
with
their
claws
then
they
leant
down
over
the
sides
of
his
head
and
began
clipping
snips
out
of
his
ears
for
all
the
world
as
though
they
were
punching
tickets
that
is
all
they
did
they
never
bit
them
anywhere
else
except
the
ears
but
it
won
the
war
for
us
with
howls
pitiful
to
hear
the
fell
over
one
another
in
their
haste
to
get
out
of
that
accursed
village
it
was
no
use
their
trying
to
pull
the
parrots
off
their
heads
because
for
each
head
there
were
always
four
more
parrots
waiting
impatiently
to
get
on
some
of
the
enemy
were
lucky
and
with
only
a
snip
or
two
managed
to
get
outside
the
the
parrots
immediately
left
them
alone
but
with
most
before
the
black
birds
had
done
with
them
the
ears
presented
a
very
singular
the
edge
of
a
this
treatment
very
painful
at
the
time
did
not
however
do
them
any
permanent
harm
beyond
the
change
in
looks
and
it
later
got
to
be
the
tribal
mark
of
the
no
really
smart
young
lady
of
this
tribe
would
be
seen
walking
with
a
man
who
did
not
have
scalloped
such
was
a
proof
that
he
had
been
in
the
great
war
and
that
though
it
is
not
generally
known
to
scientists
is
how
this
people
came
to
be
called
by
the
other
indian
nations
the
as
soon
as
the
village
was
cleared
of
the
enemy
the
doctor
turned
his
attention
to
the
wounded
in
spite
of
the
length
and
fierceness
of
the
struggle
there
were
surprisingly
few
serious
injuries
poor
long
arrow
was
the
worst
off
however
after
the
doctor
had
washed
his
wound
and
got
him
to
bed
he
opened
his
eyes
and
said
he
already
felt
better
bumpo
was
only
badly
stunned
with
this
part
of
the
business
over
the
doctor
called
to
polynesia
to
have
the
black
parrots
drive
the
enemy
right
back
into
their
own
country
and
to
wait
there
guarding
them
all
night
polynesia
gave
the
short
word
of
command
and
like
one
bird
those
millions
of
parrots
opened
their
red
beaks
and
let
out
once
more
their
terrifying
the
didn
t
wait
to
be
bitten
a
second
time
but
fled
over
the
mountains
from
which
they
had
come
whilst
polynesia
and
her
victorious
army
followed
watchfully
behind
like
a
great
threatening
black
cloud
the
doctor
picked
up
his
high
hat
which
had
been
knocked
off
in
the
fight
dusted
it
carefully
and
put
it
on
he
said
shaking
his
fist
towards
the
hills
we
will
arrange
the
terms
of
we
will
arrange
the
city
of
his
words
were
greeted
with
cheers
of
triumph
from
the
admiring
popsipetels
the
war
was
over
seventh
the
peace
of
the
parrots
the
next
day
we
set
out
for
the
far
end
of
the
island
and
reaching
it
in
canoes
for
we
went
by
sea
after
a
journey
of
hours
we
remained
no
longer
than
was
necessary
in
the
city
of
when
he
threw
himself
into
that
fight
at
popsipetel
i
saw
the
doctor
really
angry
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
but
his
anger
once
aroused
was
slow
to
die
all
the
way
down
the
coast
of
the
island
he
never
ceased
to
rail
against
this
cowardly
people
who
had
attacked
his
friends
the
popsipetels
for
no
other
reason
but
to
rob
them
of
their
corn
because
they
were
too
idle
to
till
the
land
themselves
and
he
was
still
angry
when
he
reached
the
city
of
long
arrow
had
not
come
with
us
for
he
was
as
yet
too
weak
from
his
wound
but
the
clever
at
already
getting
familiar
with
the
indian
tongue
besides
among
the
popsipetels
who
accompanied
us
to
paddle
the
canoes
was
one
boy
to
whom
we
had
taught
a
little
english
he
and
the
doctor
between
them
managed
to
make
themselves
understood
to
the
this
people
with
the
terrible
parrots
still
blackening
the
hills
about
their
stone
town
waiting
for
the
word
to
descend
and
attack
were
we
found
in
a
very
humble
mood
leaving
our
canoes
we
passed
up
the
main
street
to
the
palace
of
the
chief
bumpo
and
i
couldn
t
help
smiling
with
satisfaction
as
we
saw
how
the
waiting
crowds
which
lined
the
roadway
bowed
their
heads
to
the
ground
as
the
little
round
angry
figure
of
the
doctor
strutted
ahead
of
us
with
his
chin
in
the
air
at
the
foot
of
the
the
chief
and
all
the
more
important
personages
of
the
tribe
were
waiting
to
meet
him
smiling
humbly
and
holding
out
their
hands
in
friendliness
the
doctor
took
not
the
slightest
notice
he
marched
right
by
them
up
the
steps
to
the
door
of
the
palace
there
he
turned
around
and
at
once
began
to
address
the
people
in
a
firm
voice
i
never
heard
such
a
speech
in
my
i
am
quite
sure
that
they
never
did
either
first
he
called
them
a
long
string
of
names
cowards
loafers
thieves
vagabonds
bullies
and
what
not
then
he
said
he
was
still
seriously
thinking
of
allowing
the
parrots
to
drive
them
on
into
the
sea
in
order
that
this
pleasant
land
might
be
rid
once
for
all
of
their
worthless
carcases
at
this
a
great
cry
for
mercy
went
up
and
the
chief
and
all
of
them
fell
on
their
knees
calling
out
that
they
would
submit
to
any
conditions
of
peace
he
wished
then
the
doctor
called
for
one
of
their
is
a
man
who
did
and
on
the
stone
walls
of
the
palace
of
he
bade
him
write
down
the
terms
of
the
peace
as
he
dictated
it
this
peace
is
known
as
peace
of
the
most
and
is
strictly
to
this
day
it
was
quite
long
in
words
the
half
of
the
was
covered
with
and
fifty
pots
of
paint
were
used
before
the
weary
scribe
had
done
but
the
main
part
of
it
all
was
that
there
should
be
no
more
fighting
and
that
the
two
tribes
should
give
solemn
promise
to
help
one
another
whenever
there
was
or
other
distress
in
the
lands
belonging
to
either
this
greatly
surprised
the
they
had
expected
from
the
doctor
s
angry
face
that
he
would
at
least
chop
a
couple
of
hundred
heads
probably
make
the
rest
of
them
slaves
for
life
but
when
they
saw
that
he
only
meant
kindly
by
them
their
great
fear
of
him
changed
to
a
tremendous
admiration
and
as
he
ended
his
long
speech
and
walked
briskly
down
the
steps
again
on
his
way
back
to
the
canoes
the
group
of
chieftains
threw
themselves
at
his
feet
and
cried
do
but
stay
with
us
great
lord
and
all
the
riches
of
shall
be
poured
into
your
lap
we
know
of
in
the
mountains
and
beneath
the
sea
only
stay
with
us
that
your
wisdom
may
lead
our
council
and
our
people
in
prosperity
and
the
doctor
held
up
his
hand
for
silence
no
man
said
he
would
wish
to
be
the
guest
of
the
till
they
had
proved
by
their
deeds
that
they
are
an
honest
race
be
true
to
the
terms
of
the
peace
and
from
yourselves
shall
come
good
government
and
then
he
turned
and
followed
by
bumpo
the
popsipetels
and
myself
walked
rapidly
down
to
the
canoes
eighth
the
hanging
stone
but
the
change
of
heart
in
the
was
really
sincere
the
doctor
had
made
a
great
impression
on
deeper
one
than
even
he
himself
realized
at
the
time
in
fact
i
sometimes
think
that
that
speech
of
his
from
the
had
more
effect
upon
the
indians
of
spidermonkey
island
than
had
any
of
his
great
deeds
which
great
though
they
were
were
always
magnified
and
exaggerated
when
the
news
of
them
was
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
a
sick
girl
was
brought
to
him
as
he
reached
the
place
where
the
boats
lay
she
turned
out
to
have
some
quite
simple
ailment
which
he
quickly
gave
the
remedy
for
but
this
increased
his
popularity
still
more
and
when
he
stepped
into
his
canoe
the
people
all
around
us
actually
burst
into
tears
it
seems
i
learned
this
afterwards
that
they
thought
he
was
going
away
across
the
sea
for
good
to
the
mysterious
foreign
lands
from
which
he
had
come
some
of
the
chieftains
spoke
to
the
popsipetels
as
we
pushed
off
what
they
said
i
did
not
understand
but
we
noticed
that
several
canoes
filled
with
followed
us
at
a
respectful
distance
all
the
way
back
to
popsipetel
the
doctor
had
determined
to
return
by
the
other
shore
so
that
we
should
be
thus
able
to
make
a
complete
trip
round
the
island
s
shores
shortly
after
we
started
while
still
off
the
lower
end
of
the
island
we
sighted
a
steep
point
on
the
coast
where
the
sea
was
in
a
great
state
of
turmoil
white
with
soapy
froth
on
going
nearer
we
found
that
this
was
caused
by
our
friendly
whales
who
were
still
faithfully
working
away
with
their
noses
against
the
end
of
the
island
driving
us
northward
we
had
been
kept
so
busy
with
the
war
that
we
had
forgotten
all
about
them
but
as
we
paused
and
watched
their
mighty
tails
lashing
and
churning
the
sea
we
suddenly
realized
that
we
had
not
felt
cold
in
quite
a
long
while
speeding
up
our
boat
lest
the
island
be
carried
away
from
us
altogether
we
passed
on
up
the
coast
and
here
and
there
we
noticed
that
the
trees
on
the
shore
already
looked
greener
and
more
healthy
spidermonkey
island
was
getting
back
into
her
home
climates
about
halfway
to
popsipetel
we
went
ashore
and
spent
two
or
three
days
exploring
the
central
part
of
the
island
our
indian
paddlers
took
us
up
into
the
mountains
very
steep
and
high
in
this
region
overhanging
the
sea
and
they
showed
us
what
they
called
the
whispering
rocks
this
was
a
very
peculiar
and
striking
piece
of
scenery
it
was
like
a
great
vast
basin
or
circus
in
the
mountains
and
out
of
the
centre
of
it
there
rose
a
table
of
rock
with
an
ivory
chair
upon
it
all
around
this
the
mountains
went
up
like
stairs
or
to
a
great
at
one
narrow
end
which
was
open
to
a
view
of
the
sea
you
could
imagine
it
a
or
for
giants
and
the
rock
table
in
the
centre
the
stage
for
performers
or
the
stand
for
the
speaker
illustration
working
away
with
their
noses
against
the
end
of
the
island
we
asked
our
guides
why
it
was
called
the
whispering
rocks
and
they
said
go
down
into
it
and
we
will
show
the
great
bowl
was
miles
deep
and
miles
wide
we
scrambled
down
the
rocks
and
they
showed
us
how
even
when
you
stood
far
far
apart
from
one
another
you
merely
had
to
whisper
in
that
great
place
and
every
one
in
the
theatre
could
hear
you
this
was
the
doctor
said
on
account
of
the
echoes
which
played
backwards
and
forwards
between
the
high
walls
of
rock
our
guides
told
us
that
it
was
here
in
days
long
gone
by
when
the
popsipetels
owned
the
whole
of
spidermonkey
island
that
the
kings
were
crowned
the
ivory
chair
upon
the
table
was
the
throne
in
which
they
sat
and
so
great
was
the
big
theatre
that
all
the
indians
in
the
island
were
able
to
get
seats
in
it
to
see
the
ceremony
they
showed
us
also
an
enormous
hanging
stone
perched
on
the
edge
of
a
volcano
s
highest
summit
in
the
whole
island
although
it
was
very
far
below
us
we
could
see
it
quite
plainly
and
it
looked
wobbly
enough
to
be
pushed
off
its
perch
with
the
hand
there
was
a
legend
among
the
people
they
said
that
when
the
greatest
of
all
popsipetel
kings
should
be
crowned
in
the
ivory
chair
this
hanging
stone
would
tumble
into
the
volcano
s
mouth
and
go
straight
down
to
the
centre
of
the
earth
illustration
the
whispering
rocks
the
doctor
said
he
would
like
to
go
and
examine
it
closer
and
when
we
were
come
to
the
lip
of
the
volcano
it
took
us
half
a
day
to
get
up
to
it
we
found
the
stone
was
unbelievably
as
a
cathedral
underneath
it
we
could
look
right
down
into
a
black
hole
which
seemed
to
have
no
bottom
the
doctor
explained
to
us
that
volcanoes
sometimes
spurted
up
fire
from
these
holes
in
their
tops
but
that
those
on
floating
islands
were
always
cold
and
dead
stubbins
he
said
looking
up
at
the
great
stone
towering
above
us
do
you
know
what
would
most
likely
happen
if
that
boulder
should
fall
in
no
said
i
what
you
remember
the
which
the
porpoises
told
us
lies
under
the
centre
of
the
island
well
this
stone
is
heavy
enough
if
it
fell
into
the
volcano
to
break
through
into
that
from
above
and
once
it
did
the
air
would
escape
and
the
floating
island
would
float
no
more
it
would
but
then
everybody
on
it
would
be
drowned
wouldn
t
they
said
bumpo
oh
no
not
necessarily
that
would
depend
on
the
depth
of
the
sea
where
the
sinking
took
place
the
island
might
touch
bottom
when
it
had
only
gone
down
say
a
hundred
feet
but
there
would
be
lots
of
it
still
sticking
up
above
the
water
then
wouldn
t
there
yes
said
bumpo
i
suppose
there
would
well
let
us
hope
that
the
ponderous
fragment
does
lose
its
equilibriosity
for
i
don
t
believe
it
would
stop
at
the
centre
of
the
likely
it
would
fall
right
through
the
world
and
come
out
the
other
many
other
wonders
there
were
which
these
men
showed
us
in
the
central
regions
of
their
island
but
i
have
not
time
or
space
to
tell
you
of
them
now
descending
towards
the
shore
again
we
noticed
that
we
were
still
being
watched
even
here
among
the
highlands
by
the
who
had
followed
us
and
when
we
put
to
sea
once
more
a
boatload
of
them
proceeded
to
go
ahead
of
us
in
the
direction
of
popsipetel
having
lighter
canoes
they
traveled
faster
than
our
party
and
we
judged
that
they
should
reach
the
that
was
where
they
were
hours
before
we
could
the
doctor
was
now
becoming
anxious
to
see
how
long
arrow
was
getting
on
so
we
all
took
turns
at
the
paddles
and
went
on
traveling
by
moonlight
through
the
whole
night
we
reached
popsipetel
just
as
the
dawn
was
breaking
to
our
great
surprise
we
found
that
not
only
we
but
the
whole
village
also
had
been
up
all
night
a
great
crowd
was
gathered
about
the
dead
chief
s
house
and
as
we
landed
our
canoes
upon
the
beach
we
saw
a
large
number
of
old
men
the
seniors
of
the
tribe
coming
out
at
the
main
door
we
inquired
what
was
the
meaning
of
all
this
and
were
told
that
the
election
of
a
new
chief
had
been
going
on
all
through
the
whole
night
bumpo
asked
the
name
of
the
new
chief
but
this
it
seemed
had
not
yet
been
given
out
it
would
be
announced
at
as
soon
as
the
doctor
had
paid
a
visit
to
long
arrow
and
seen
that
he
was
doing
nicely
we
proceeded
to
our
own
house
at
the
far
end
of
the
village
here
we
ate
some
breakfast
and
then
lay
down
to
take
a
good
rest
rest
indeed
we
needed
for
life
had
been
strenuous
and
busy
for
us
ever
since
we
had
landed
on
the
island
and
it
wasn
t
many
minutes
after
our
weary
heads
struck
the
pillows
that
the
whole
crew
of
us
were
sound
asleep
ninth
the
election
we
were
awakened
by
music
the
glaring
noonday
sunlight
was
streaming
in
at
our
door
outside
of
which
some
kind
of
a
band
appeared
to
be
playing
we
got
up
and
looked
out
our
house
was
surrounded
by
the
whole
population
of
popsipetel
we
were
used
to
having
quite
a
number
of
curious
and
admiring
indians
waiting
at
our
door
at
all
hours
but
this
was
quite
different
the
vast
crowd
was
dressed
in
its
best
clothes
bright
beads
gawdy
feathers
and
gay
blankets
gave
cheerful
color
to
the
scene
every
one
seemed
in
very
good
humor
singing
or
playing
on
musical
painted
wooden
whistles
or
drums
made
from
skins
we
found
while
we
slept
had
arrived
back
from
on
our
watching
the
show
we
asked
her
what
all
the
was
about
the
result
of
the
election
has
just
been
announced
said
she
the
name
of
the
new
chief
was
given
out
at
and
who
is
the
new
chief
asked
the
doctor
you
are
said
polynesia
quietly
gasped
the
well
of
all
things
yes
said
she
you
re
the
what
s
more
they
ve
changed
your
surname
for
you
they
didn
t
think
that
dolittle
was
a
proper
or
respectful
name
for
a
man
who
had
done
so
much
so
you
are
now
to
be
known
as
jong
thinkalot
how
do
you
like
it
but
i
don
t
to
be
a
chief
said
the
doctor
in
an
irritable
voice
i
m
afraid
you
ll
have
hard
work
to
get
out
of
it
now
said
unless
you
re
willing
to
put
to
sea
again
in
one
of
their
rickety
canoes
you
see
you
ve
been
elected
not
merely
the
chief
of
the
popsipetels
you
re
to
be
a
king
of
the
whole
of
spidermonkey
island
the
who
were
so
anxious
to
have
you
govern
them
sent
spies
and
messengers
ahead
of
you
and
when
they
found
that
you
had
been
elected
chief
of
the
popsipetels
overnight
they
were
bitterly
disappointed
however
rather
than
lose
you
altogether
the
were
willing
to
give
up
their
independence
and
insisted
that
they
and
their
lands
be
united
to
the
popsipetels
in
order
that
you
could
be
made
king
of
both
so

re
in
for

the
doctor

be
so
enthusiastic

i

rather
proud
and

a
chance

be
a

i
know
it
sounds
grand
said
he
pulling
on
his
boots
miserably
but
the
trouble
is
you

t
take
up
responsibilities
and
then
just
drop
them
again
when
you
feel
like
it
i
have
my
own
work
to
do
scarcely
one
moment
have
i
had

island
i

popsipetels

the
end
of

polynesia
here
come
the
head
men
to
announce
your
election
hurry
up
and
get
your
boots
the
throng
before
our
door
had
suddenly
parted
asunder
making
a
long
lane
and
down
this
we
now
saw
a
group
of
personages
coming
towards
us
the
man
in
front
a
handsome
old
indian
with
a
wrinkled
face
carried
in
his
hands
a
wooden
truly
beautiful
and
gorgeous
crown
even
though
of
wood
wonderfully
carved
and
painted
it
had
two
lovely
blue
feathers
springing
from
the
front
of
it
behind
the
old
man
came
eight
strong
indians
bearing
a
litter
a
sort
of
chair
with
long
handles
underneath
to
carry
it
by
kneeling
down
on
one
knee
bending
his
head
almost
to
the
ground
the
old
man
addressed
the
doctor
who
now
stood
in
the
doorway
putting
on
his
collar
and
tie
oh
mighty
one
said
he
we
bring
you
word
from
the
popsipetel
people
great
are
your
deeds
beyond
belief
kind
is
your
heart
and
your
wisdom
deeper
than
the
sea
our
chief
is
dead
the
people
clamor
for
a
worthy
leader
our
old
enemies
the
are
become
through
you
our
brothers
and
good
friends
they
too
desire
to
bask
beneath
the
sunshine
of
your
smile
behold
then
i
bring
to
you
the
sacred
crown
of
popsipetel
which
since
ancient
days
when
this
island
and
its
peoples
were
one
beneath
one
monarch
has
rested
on
no
kingly
brow
oh
kindly
one
we
are
bidden
by
the
united
voices
of
the
peoples
of
this
land
to
carry
you
to
the
whispering
rocks
that
there
with
all
respect
and
majesty
you
may
be
crowned
our
of
all
the
moving
the
good
indians
did
not
seem
to
have
even
considered
the
possibility
of
john
dolittle
s
refusing
as
for
the
poor
doctor
i
never
saw
him
so
upset
by
anything
it
was
in
fact
the
only
time
i
have
known
him
to
get
thoroughly
fussed
oh
dear
i
heard
him
murmur
looking
around
wildly
for
some
escape
what
i
do
any
of
you
see
where
i
laid
that
stud
of
mine
on
earth
can
i
get
this
collar
on
without
a
stud
what
a
day
this
is
to
be
sure
it
rolled
under
the
bed
do
think
they
might
have
given
me
a
day
or
so
to
think
it
over
in
who
ever
heard
of
waking
a
man
right
out
of
his
sleep
and
telling
him
he
s
got
to
be
a
king
before
he
has
even
washed
his
face
can
t
any
of
you
find
it
maybe
you
re
standing
on
it
bumpo
move
your
oh
don
t
bother
about
your
stud
said
polynesia
you
will
have
to
be
crowned
without
a
collar
they
won
t
know
the
i
tell
you
i
m
not
going
to
be
crowned
cried
the
not
if
i
can
help
it
i
ll
make
them
a
speech
perhaps
that
will
satisfy
he
turned
back
to
the
indians
at
the
door
my
friends
he
said
i
am
not
worthy
of
this
great
honor
you
would
do
me
little
or
no
skill
have
i
in
the
arts
of
kingcraft
assuredly
among
your
own
brave
men
you
will
find
many
better
fitted
to
lead
you
for
this
compliment
this
confidence
and
trust
i
thank
you
but
i
pray
you
do
not
think
of
me
for
such
high
duties
which
i
could
not
possibly
the
old
man
repeated
his
words
to
the
people
behind
him
in
a
louder
voice
stolidly
they
shook
their
heads
moving
not
an
inch
the
old
man
turned
back
to
the
doctor
you
are
the
chosen
one
said
he
they
will
have
none
but
into
the
doctor
s
perplexed
face
suddenly
there
came
a
flash
of
hope
i
ll
go
and
see
long
arrow
he
whispered
to
me
perhaps
he
will
know
of
some
way
to
get
me
out
of
and
asking
the
personages
to
excuse
him
a
moment
he
left
them
there
standing
at
his
door
and
hurried
off
in
the
direction
of
long
arrow
s
house
i
followed
him
we
found
our
big
friend
lying
on
a
grass
bed
outside
his
home
where
he
had
been
moved
that
he
might
witness
the
long
arrow
said
the
doctor
speaking
quickly
in
eagle
tongue
so
that
the
bystanders
should
not
overhear
in
dire
peril
i
come
to
you
for
help
these
men
would
make
me
their
king
if
such
a
thing
befall
me
all
the
great
work
i
hoped
to
do
must
go
undone
for
who
is
there
unfreer
than
a
king
i
pray
you
speak
with
them
and
persuade
their
kind
hearts
that
what
they
plan
to
do
would
be
long
arrow
raised
himself
upon
his
elbow
oh
kindly
one
said
he
this
seemed
now
to
have
become
the
usual
manner
of
address
when
speaking
to
the
doctor
sorely
it
grieves
me
that
the
first
wish
you
ask
of
me
i
should
be
unable
to
grant
alas
i
can
do
nothing
these
people
have
so
set
their
hearts
on
keeping
you
for
king
that
if
i
tried
to
interfere
they
would
drive
me
from
their
land
and
likely
crown
you
in
the
end
in
any
case
a
king
you
must
be
if
only
for
a
while
we
must
so
arrange
the
business
of
governing
that
you
may
have
time
to
give
to
nature
s
secrets
later
we
may
be
able
to
hit
upon
some
plan
to
relieve
you
of
the
burden
of
the
crown
but
for
now
you
must
be
king
these
people
are
a
headstrong
tribe
and
they
will
have
their
way
there
is
no
other
sadly
the
doctor
turned
away
from
the
bed
and
faced
about
and
there
behind
him
stood
the
old
man
again
the
crown
still
held
in
his
wrinkled
hands
and
the
royal
litter
waiting
at
his
elbow
with
a
deep
reverence
the
bearers
motioned
towards
the
seat
of
the
chair
inviting
the
white
man
to
get
in
once
more
the
poor
doctor
looked
wildly
hopelessly
about
him
for
some
means
of
escape
for
a
moment
i
thought
he
was
going
to
take
to
his
heels
and
run
for
it
but
the
crowd
around
us
was
far
too
thick
and
densely
packed
for
anyone
to
break
through
it
a
band
of
whistles
and
drums
near
by
suddenly
started
the
music
of
a
solemn
processional
march
he
turned
back
pleadingly
again
to
long
arrow
in
a
last
appeal
for
help
but
the
big
indian
merely
shook
his
head
and
pointed
like
the
bearers
to
the
waiting
chair
at
last
almost
in
tears
john
dolittle
stepped
slowly
into
the
litter
and
sat
down
as
he
was
hoisted
on
to
the
broad
shoulders
of
the
bearers
i
heard
him
still
feebly
muttering
beneath
his
breath
botheration
take
it
don
t
to
be
a
king
farewell
called
long
arrow
from
his
bed
and
may
good
fortune
ever
stand
within
the
shadow
of
your
throne
he
comes
comes
murmured
the
crowd
away
away
the
whispering
rocks
and
as
the
procession
formed
up
to
leave
the
village
the
crowd
about
us
began
hurrying
off
in
the
direction
of
the
mountains
to
make
sure
of
good
seats
in
the
giant
theatre
where
the
crowning
ceremony
would
take
place
tenth
the
coronation
of
king
jong
in
my
long
lifetime
i
have
seen
many
grand
and
inspiring
things
but
never
anything
that
impressed
me
half
as
much
as
the
sight
of
the
whispering
rocks
as
they
looked
on
the
day
king
jong
was
crowned
as
bumpo
polynesia
jip
and
i
finally
reached
the
dizzy
edge
of
the
great
bowl
and
looked
down
inside
it
it
was
like
gazing
over
a
ocean
of
faces
for
every
seat
in
the
theatre
was
filled
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
long
arrow
who
had
been
carried
up
on
his
sick
there
to
see
the
show
yet
not
a
sound
not
a
disturbed
the
solemn
silence
of
the
whispering
rocks
it
was
quite
creepy
and
sent
chills
running
up
and
down
your
spine
bumpo
told
me
afterwards
that
it
took
his
breath
away
too
much
for
him
to
speak
but
that
he
hadn
t
known
before
that
there
were
that
many
people
in
the
world
away
down
by
the
table
of
the
throne
stood
a
brightly
colored
all
the
indian
families
had
and
kept
them
set
up
before
the
doors
of
their
houses
the
idea
of
a
is
something
like
a
or
a
visiting
card
it
represents
in
its
carvings
the
deeds
and
qualities
of
the
family
to
which
it
belongs
this
one
beautifully
decorated
and
much
higher
than
any
other
was
the
dolittle
or
as
it
was
to
be
henceforth
called
the
royal
thinkalot
totem
it
had
nothing
but
animals
on
it
to
signify
the
doctor
s
great
knowledge
of
creatures
and
the
animals
chosen
to
be
shown
were
those
which
to
the
indians
were
supposed
to
represent
good
qualities
of
character
such
as
the
deer
for
speed
the
ox
for
perseverance
the
fish
for
discretion
and
so
on
but
at
the
top
of
the
totem
is
always
placed
the
sign
or
animal
by
which
the
family
is
most
proud
to
be
known
this
on
the
thinkalot
pole
was
an
enormous
parrot
in
memory
of
the
famous
peace
of
the
parrots
the
ivory
throne
had
been
all
polished
with
scented
oil
and
it
glistened
whitely
in
the
strong
sunlight
at
the
foot
of
it
there
had
been
strewn
great
quantities
of
branches
of
flowering
trees
which
with
the
new
warmth
of
milder
climates
were
now
blossoming
in
the
valleys
of
the
island
soon
we
saw
the
royal
litter
with
the
doctor
seated
in
it
slowly
ascending
the
winding
steps
of
the
table
reaching
the
flat
top
at
last
it
halted
and
the
doctor
stepped
out
upon
the
flowery
carpet
so
still
and
perfect
was
the
silence
that
even
at
that
distance
above
i
distinctly
heard
a
twig
snap
beneath
his
tread
walking
to
the
throne
accompanied
by
the
old
man
the
doctor
got
up
upon
the
stand
and
sat
down
how
tiny
his
little
round
figure
looked
when
seen
from
that
tremendous
height
the
throne
had
been
made
for
kings
and
when
he
was
seated
his
feet
did
not
reach
the
ground
but
dangled
six
inches
from
the
top
step
then
the
old
man
turned
round
and
looking
up
at
the
people
began
to
speak
in
a
quiet
even
voice
but
every
word
he
said
was
easily
heard
in
the
furthest
corner
of
the
whispering
rocks
first
he
recited
the
names
of
all
the
great
popsipetel
kings
who
in
days
long
ago
had
been
crowned
in
this
ivory
chair
he
spoke
of
the
greatness
of
the
popsipetel
people
of
their
triumphs
of
their
hardships
then
waving
his
hand
towards
the
doctor
he
began
recounting
the
things
which
this
had
done
and
i
am
bound
to
say
that
they
easily
outmatched
the
deeds
of
those
who
had
gone
before
him
as
soon
as
he
started
to
speak
of
what
the
doctor
had
achieved
for
the
tribe
the
people
still
strictly
silent
all
began
waving
their
right
hands
towards
the
throne
this
gave
to
the
vast
theatre
a
very
singular
appearance
acres
and
acres
of
something
never
a
sound
at
last
the
old
man
finished
his
speech
and
stepping
up
to
the
chair
very
respectfully
removed
the
doctor
s
battered
high
hat
he
was
about
to
put
it
upon
the
ground
but
the
doctor
took
it
from
him
hastily
and
kept
it
on
his
lap
then
taking
up
the
sacred
crown
he
placed
it
upon
john
dolittle
s
head
it
did
not
fit
very
well
for
it
had
been
made
for
kings
and
when
the
wind
blew
in
freshly
from
the
sunlit
sea
the
doctor
had
some
difficulty
in
keeping
it
on
but
it
looked
very
splendid
turning
once
more
to
the
people
the
old
man
said
men
of
popsipetel
behold
your
elected
king
you
content
and
then
at
last
the
voice
of
the
people
broke
loose
jong
jong
they
shouted
long
live
king
jong
the
sound
burst
upon
the
solemn
silence
with
the
crash
of
a
hundred
cannon
there
where
even
a
whisper
carried
miles
the
shock
of
it
was
like
a
blow
in
the
face
back
and
forth
the
mountains
threw
it
to
one
another
i
thought
the
echoes
of
it
would
never
die
away
as
it
passed
rumbling
through
the
whole
island
jangling
among
the
lower
valleys
booming
in
the
distant
suddenly
i
saw
the
old
man
point
upward
to
the
highest
mountain
in
the
island
and
looking
over
my
shoulder
i
was
just
in
time
to
see
the
hanging
stone
topple
slowly
out
of
into
the
heart
of
the
volcano
see
ye
men
of
the
moving
land
the
old
man
cried
the
stone
has
fallen
and
our
legend
has
come
true
the
king
of
kings
is
crowned
this
day
the
doctor
too
had
seen
the
stone
fall
and
he
was
now
standing
up
looking
at
the
sea
expectantly
he
s
thinking
of
the
said
bumpo
in
my
ear
let
us
hope
that
the
sea
isn
t
very
deep
in
these
after
a
full
minute
so
long
did
it
take
the
stone
to
fall
that
depth
we
heard
a
muffled
distant
crunching
then
immediately
after
a
great
hissing
of
escaping
air
the
doctor
his
face
tense
with
anxiety
sat
down
in
the
throne
again
still
watching
the
blue
water
of
the
ocean
with
staring
eyes
soon
we
felt
the
island
slowly
sinking
beneath
us
we
saw
the
sea
creep
inland
over
the
beaches
as
the
shores
went
foot
three
feet
ten
feet
twenty
fifty
a
hundred
and
then
thank
goodness
gently
as
a
butterfly
alighting
on
a
rose
it
stopped
spidermonkey
island
had
come
to
rest
on
the
sandy
bottom
of
the
atlantic
and
earth
was
joined
to
earth
once
more
of
course
many
of
the
houses
near
the
shores
were
now
under
water
popsipetel
village
itself
had
entirely
disappeared
but
it
didn
t
matter
no
one
was
drowned
for
every
soul
in
the
island
was
high
up
in
the
hills
watching
the
coronation
of
king
jong
the
indians
themselves
did
not
realize
at
the
time
what
was
taking
place
though
of
course
they
had
felt
the
land
sinking
beneath
them
the
doctor
told
us
afterwards
that
it
must
have
been
the
shock
of
that
tremendous
shout
coming
from
a
million
throats
at
once
which
had
toppled
the
hanging
stone
off
its
perch
but
in
popsipetel
history
the
story
was
handed
down
and
it
is
firmly
believed
to
this
day
that
when
king
jong
sat
upon
the
throne
so
great
was
his
mighty
weight
that
the
very
island
itself
sank
down
to
do
him
honor
and
never
moved
again
illustration
part
six
first
new
popsipetel
jong
thinkalot
had
not
ruled
over
his
new
kingdom
for
more
than
a
couple
of
days
before
my
notions
about
kings
and
the
kind
of
lives
they
led
changed
very
considerably
i
had
thought
that
all
that
kings
had
to
do
was
to
sit
on
a
throne
and
have
people
bow
down
before
them
several
times
a
day
i
now
saw
that
a
king
can
be
the
man
in
the
he
attends
properly
to
his
business
from
the
moment
that
he
got
up
early
in
the
morning
till
the
time
he
went
to
bed
late
at
days
in
the
dolittle
was
busy
busy
busy
first
of
all
there
was
the
new
town
to
be
built
the
village
of
popsipetel
had
disappeared
the
city
of
new
popsipetel
must
be
made
with
great
care
a
place
was
chosen
for
a
very
beautiful
position
it
was
at
the
mouth
of
a
large
river
the
shores
of
the
island
at
this
point
formed
a
lovely
wide
bay
where
ships
too
if
they
should
ever
lie
peacefully
at
anchor
without
danger
from
storms
in
building
this
town
the
doctor
gave
the
indians
a
lot
of
new
ideas
he
showed
them
what
were
and
how
garbage
should
be
collected
each
day
and
burnt
high
up
in
the
hills
he
made
a
large
lake
by
damming
a
stream
this
was
the
for
the
town
none
of
these
things
had
the
indians
ever
seen
and
many
of
the
sicknesses
which
they
had
suffered
from
before
were
now
entirely
prevented
by
proper
drainage
and
pure
peoples
who
don
t
use
fire
do
not
of
course
have
metals
either
because
without
fire
it
is
almost
impossible
to
shape
iron
and
steel
one
of
the
first
things
that
john
dolittle
did
was
to
search
the
mountains
till
he
found
iron
and
copper
mines
then
he
set
to
work
to
teach
the
indians
how
these
metals
could
be
melted
and
made
into
knives
and
plows
and
and
all
manner
of
things
in
his
kingdom
the
doctor
tried
his
hardest
to
do
away
with
most
of
the
pomp
and
grandeur
of
a
royal
court
as
he
said
to
bumpo
and
me
if
he
must
be
a
king
he
meant
to
be
a
thoroughly
democratic
one
that
is
a
king
who
is
chummy
and
friendly
with
his
subjects
and
doesn
t
put
on
airs
and
when
he
drew
up
the
plans
for
the
city
of
new
popsipetel
he
had
no
palace
shown
of
any
kind
a
little
cottage
in
a
back
street
was
all
that
he
had
provided
for
himself
but
this
the
indians
would
not
permit
on
any
account
they
had
been
used
to
having
their
kings
rule
in
a
truly
grand
and
kingly
manner
and
they
insisted
that
he
have
built
for
himself
the
most
magnificent
palace
ever
seen
in
all
else
they
let
him
have
his
own
way
absolutely
but
they
wouldn
t
allow
him
to
wriggle
out
of
any
of
the
ceremony
or
show
that
goes
with
being
a
king
a
thousand
servants
he
had
to
keep
in
his
palace
night
and
day
to
wait
on
him
the
royal
canoe
had
to
be
kept
gorgeous
polished
mahogany
boat
seventy
feet
long
inlaid
with
and
paddled
by
the
hundred
strongest
men
in
the
island
the
covered
a
square
mile
and
employed
a
hundred
and
sixty
gardeners
even
in
his
dress
the
poor
man
was
compelled
always
to
be
grand
and
elegant
and
uncomfortable
the
beloved
and
battered
high
hat
was
put
away
in
a
closet
and
only
looked
at
secretly
state
robes
had
to
be
worn
on
all
occasions
and
when
the
doctor
did
once
in
a
while
manage
to
sneak
off
for
a
short
expedition
he
never
dared
to
wear
his
old
clothes
but
had
to
chase
his
butterflies
with
a
crown
upon
his
head
and
a
scarlet
cloak
flying
behind
him
in
the
wind
there
was
no
end
to
the
kinds
of
duties
the
doctor
had
to
perform
and
the
questions
he
had
to
decide
from
settling
disputes
about
lands
and
boundaries
to
making
peace
between
husband
and
wife
who
had
been
throwing
shoes
at
one
another
in
the
east
wing
of
the
royal
palace
was
the
hall
of
justice
and
here
king
jong
sat
every
morning
from
nine
to
eleven
passing
judgment
on
all
cases
that
were
brought
before
him
illustration
had
to
chase
his
butterflies
with
a
crown
upon
his
head
then
in
the
afternoon
he
taught
school
the
sort
of
things
he
taught
were
not
always
those
you
find
in
ordinary
schools
as
well
as
children
came
to
learn
you
see
these
indians
were
ignorant
of
many
of
the
things
that
quite
small
white
children
it
is
also
true
that
they
knew
a
lot
that
white
never
dreamed
of
bumpo
and
i
helped
with
the
teaching
as
far
as
we
arithmetic
and
easy
things
like
that
but
the
classes
in
astronomy
farming
science
the
proper
care
of
babies
with
a
host
of
other
subjects
the
doctor
had
to
teach
himself
the
indians
were
tremendously
keen
about
the
schooling
and
they
came
in
droves
and
crowds
so
that
even
with
the
classes
a
was
impossible
of
course
the
doctor
had
to
take
them
in
relays
and
batches
of
five
or
six
thousand
at
a
time
and
used
a
big
megaphone
or
trumpet
to
make
himself
heard
the
rest
of
his
day
was
more
than
filled
with
building
attending
the
sick
and
a
million
other
things
in
spite
of
his
being
so
unwilling
to
become
a
king
john
dolittle
made
a
very
good
he
got
started
he
may
not
have
been
as
dignified
as
many
kings
in
history
who
were
always
running
off
to
war
and
getting
themselves
into
romantic
situations
but
since
i
have
grown
up
and
seen
something
of
foreign
lands
and
governments
i
have
often
thought
that
popsipetel
under
the
reign
of
jong
thinkalot
was
perhaps
the
best
ruled
state
in
the
history
of
the
world
the
doctor
s
birthday
came
round
after
we
had
been
on
the
island
six
months
and
a
half
the
people
made
a
great
public
holiday
of
it
and
there
was
much
feasting
dancing
fireworks
speechmaking
and
jollification
towards
the
close
of
the
day
the
chief
men
of
the
two
tribes
formed
a
procession
and
passed
through
the
streets
of
the
town
carrying
a
very
gorgeously
painted
tablet
of
ebony
wood
ten
feet
high
this
was
a
such
as
they
preserved
for
each
of
the
ancient
kings
of
popsipetel
to
record
their
deeds
with
great
and
solemn
ceremony
it
was
set
up
over
the
door
of
the
new
palace
and
everybody
then
clustered
round
to
look
at
it
it
had
six
pictures
on
it
commemorating
the
six
great
events
in
the
life
of
king
jong
and
beneath
were
written
the
verses
that
explained
them
they
were
composed
by
the
court
poet
and
this
is
a
translation
i
landing
on
the
in
his
canoe
from
worlds
unknown
he
landed
on
our
shores
the
very
palms
bowed
down
their
heads
in
welcome
to
the
coming
king
ii
meeting
with
the
by
moonlight
in
the
mountains
he
communed
with
beasts
the
shy
jabizri
brings
him
of
great
distress
iii
liberates
the
lost
big
was
his
heart
with
pity
big
were
his
hands
with
strength
see
how
he
tears
the
mountain
like
a
yam
see
how
the
lost
ones
dance
forth
to
greet
the
day
iv
makes
our
land
was
cold
and
dying
he
waved
his
hand
and
lo
lightning
leapt
from
cloudless
skies
the
sun
leant
down
and
fire
was
born
then
while
we
crowded
round
the
grateful
glow
pushed
he
our
wayward
floating
land
back
to
peaceful
anchorage
in
sunny
seas
v
leads
the
people
to
victory
in
once
only
was
his
kindly
countenance
darkened
by
a
deadly
frown
woe
to
the
wicked
enemy
that
dares
attack
the
tribe
with
thinkalot
for
chief
vi
is
crowned
the
birds
of
the
air
rejoiced
the
sea
laughed
and
gambolled
with
her
shores
all
wept
for
joy
the
day
we
crowned
him
king
he
is
the
builder
the
healer
the
teacher
and
the
prince
he
is
the
greatest
of
them
all
may
he
live
a
thousand
thousand
years
happy
in
his
heart
to
bless
our
land
with
peace
second
thoughts
of
home
in
the
royal
palace
bumpo
and
i
had
a
beautiful
suite
of
rooms
of
our
very
polynesia
jip
and
shared
with
us
officially
bumpo
was
minister
of
the
interior
while
i
was
first
lord
of
the
treasury
long
arrow
also
had
quarters
there
but
at
present
he
was
absent
traveling
abroad
one
night
after
supper
when
the
doctor
was
away
in
the
town
somewhere
visiting
a
baby
we
were
all
sitting
round
the
big
table
in
bumpo
s
this
we
did
every
evening
to
talk
over
the
plans
for
the
following
day
and
various
affairs
of
state
it
was
a
kind
of
cabinet
meeting
however
we
were
talking
about
also
about
things
to
eat
we
had
got
a
little
tired
of
indian
food
you
see
none
of
the
natives
knew
how
to
cook
and
we
had
the
most
discouraging
time
training
a
chef
for
the
royal
kitchen
most
of
them
were
champions
at
spoiling
good
food
often
we
got
so
hungry
that
the
doctor
would
sneak
downstairs
with
us
into
the
palace
basement
after
all
the
cooks
were
safe
in
bed
and
fry
pancakes
secretly
over
the
dying
embers
of
the
fire
the
doctor
himself
was
the
finest
cook
that
ever
lived
but
he
used
to
make
a
terrible
mess
of
the
kitchen
and
of
course
we
had
to
be
awfully
careful
that
we
didn
t
get
caught
well
as
i
was
saying
food
was
the
subject
of
discussion
at
the
cabinet
meeting
and
i
had
just
been
reminding
bumpo
of
the
nice
dishes
we
had
had
at
the
s
house
in
monteverde
i
tell
you
what
i
would
like
now
said
bumpo
a
large
cup
of
cocoa
with
whipped
cream
on
the
top
of
it
in
oxford
we
used
to
be
able
to
get
the
most
wonderful
cocoa
it
is
really
too
bad
they
haven
t
any
in
this
island
or
cows
to
give
when
do
you
suppose
asked
jip
the
doctor
intends
to
move
on
from
here
i
was
talking
to
him
about
that
only
yesterday
said
polynesia
but
i
couldn
t
get
any
satisfactory
answer
out
of
him
he
didn
t
seem
to
want
to
speak
about
there
was
a
pause
in
the
conversation
do
you
know
what
i
believe
she
added
presently
i
believe
the
doctor
has
given
up
even
thinking
of
going
good
lord
cried
bumpo
you
don
t
say
sh
said
polynesia
what
s
that
noise
we
listened
and
away
off
in
the
distant
corridors
of
the
palace
we
heard
the
sentries
crying
the
king
way
king
it
s
last
whispered
late
as
usual
poor
man
how
he
does
work
get
the
pipe
and
tobacco
out
of
the
cupboard
and
lay
the
ready
on
his
when
the
doctor
came
into
the
room
he
looked
serious
and
thoughtful
wearily
he
took
off
his
crown
and
hung
it
on
a
peg
behind
the
door
then
he
exchanged
the
royal
cloak
for
the
dropped
into
his
chair
at
the
head
of
the
table
with
a
deep
sigh
and
started
to
fill
his
pipe
well
asked
polynesia
quietly
how
did
you
find
the
baby
the
baby
he
thoughts
still
seemed
to
be
very
far
ah
yes
the
baby
was
much
better
thank
has
cut
its
second
then
he
was
silent
again
staring
dreamily
at
the
ceiling
through
a
cloud
of
while
we
all
sat
round
quite
still
waiting
we
were
wondering
doctor
said
i
at
last
just
before
you
came
you
would
be
starting
home
again
we
will
have
been
on
this
island
seven
months
the
doctor
sat
forward
in
his
chair
looking
rather
uncomfortable
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
said
he
after
a
moment
i
meant
to
speak
to
you
myself
this
evening
on
that
very
subject
but
it
little
hard
to
make
any
one
exactly
understand
the
situation
i
am
afraid
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
leave
the
work
i
am
now
engaged
on
you
remember
when
they
first
insisted
on
making
me
king
i
told
you
it
was
not
easy
to
shake
off
responsibilities
once
you
had
taken
them
up
these
people
have
come
to
rely
on
me
for
a
great
number
of
things
we
found
them
ignorant
of
much
that
white
people
enjoy
and
we
have
one
might
say
changed
the
current
of
their
lives
considerably
now
it
is
a
very
ticklish
business
to
change
the
lives
of
other
people
and
whether
the
changes
we
have
made
will
be
in
the
end
for
good
or
for
bad
is
our
he
thought
a
went
on
in
a
quieter
sadder
voice
i
would
like
to
continue
my
voyages
and
my
natural
history
work
and
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
much
as
any
of
you
this
is
march
and
the
crocuses
will
be
showing
in
the
lawn
but
that
which
i
feared
has
come
true
i
can
not
close
my
eyes
to
what
might
happen
if
i
should
leave
these
people
and
run
away
they
would
probably
go
back
to
their
old
habits
and
customs
wars
superstitions
and
what
not
and
many
of
the
new
things
we
have
taught
them
might
be
put
to
improper
use
and
make
their
condition
then
worse
by
far
than
that
in
which
we
found
them
they
like
me
they
trust
me
they
have
come
to
look
to
me
for
help
in
all
their
problems
and
troubles
and
no
man
wants
to
do
unfair
things
to
them
who
trust
him
and
then
again
like
they
are
as
it
were
my
never
had
any
children
of
my
i
am
terribly
interested
in
how
they
will
grow
up
don
t
you
see
what
i
mean
can
i
possibly
run
away
and
leave
them
in
the
lurch
no
i
have
thought
it
over
a
good
deal
and
tried
to
decide
what
was
best
and
i
am
afraid
that
the
work
i
took
up
when
i
assumed
the
crown
i
must
stick
to
i
m
ve
got
to
for
your
whole
life
asked
bumpo
in
a
low
voice
for
some
moments
the
doctor
frowning
made
no
answer
i
don
t
know
he
said
at
anyhow
for
the
present
there
is
certainly
no
hope
of
my
leaving
it
wouldn
t
be
the
sad
silence
that
followed
was
broken
finally
by
a
knock
upon
the
door
with
a
patient
sigh
the
doctor
got
up
and
put
on
his
crown
and
cloak
again
come
in
he
called
sitting
down
in
his
chair
once
more
the
door
opened
and
a
of
the
hundred
and
who
were
always
on
night
bowing
in
the
entrance
oh
kindly
one
said
he
there
is
a
traveler
at
the
who
would
have
speech
with
your
another
baby
s
been
born
i
ll
bet
a
shilling
muttered
polynesia
did
you
ask
the
traveler
s
name
enquired
the
doctor
yes
your
majesty
said
the
footman
it
is
long
arrow
the
son
of
golden
third
the
red
man
s
science
long
arrow
cried
the
doctor
how
splendid
show
him
him
in
at
i
m
so
glad
he
continued
turning
to
us
as
soon
as
the
footman
had
gone
i
ve
missed
long
arrow
terribly
he
s
an
awfully
good
man
to
have
if
he
doesn
t
talk
much
let
me
see
it
s
five
months
now
since
he
went
off
to
brazil
i
m
so
glad
he
s
back
safe
he
does
take
such
tremendous
chances
with
that
canoe
of
as
he
is
it
s
no
joke
crossing
a
hundred
miles
of
open
sea
in
a
canoe
i
wouldn
t
care
to
try
another
knock
and
when
the
door
swung
open
in
answer
to
the
doctor
s
call
there
stood
our
big
friend
on
the
threshold
a
smile
upon
his
strong
bronzed
face
behind
him
appeared
two
porters
carrying
loads
done
up
in
indian
these
when
the
first
salutations
were
over
long
arrow
ordered
to
lay
their
burdens
down
behold
oh
kindly
one
said
he
i
bring
you
as
i
promised
my
collection
of
plants
which
i
had
hidden
in
a
cave
in
the
andes
these
treasures
represent
the
labors
of
my
the
packages
were
opened
and
inside
were
many
smaller
packages
and
bundles
carefully
they
were
laid
out
in
rows
upon
the
table
it
appeared
at
first
a
large
but
disappointing
display
there
were
plants
flowers
fruits
leaves
roots
nuts
beans
honeys
gums
bark
seeds
bees
and
a
few
kinds
of
insects
the
study
of
botany
as
it
is
a
kind
of
natural
history
which
had
never
interested
me
very
much
i
had
considered
it
compared
with
the
study
of
animals
a
dull
science
but
as
long
arrow
began
taking
up
the
various
things
in
his
collection
and
explaining
their
qualities
to
us
i
became
more
and
more
fascinated
and
before
he
had
done
i
was
completely
absorbed
by
the
wonders
of
the
vegetable
kingdom
which
he
had
brought
so
far
these
said
he
taking
up
a
little
packet
of
big
seeds
are
what
i
have
called
what
are
they
for
asked
bumpo
to
cause
mirth
said
the
indian
bumpo
while
long
arrow
s
back
was
turned
took
three
of
the
beans
and
swallowed
them
alas
said
the
indian
when
he
discovered
what
bumpo
had
done
if
he
wished
to
try
the
powers
of
these
seeds
he
should
have
eaten
no
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
one
let
us
hope
that
he
does
not
die
of
the
beans
effect
upon
bumpo
was
most
extraordinary
first
he
broke
into
a
broad
smile
then
he
began
to
giggle
finally
he
burst
into
such
prolonged
roars
of
hearty
laughter
that
we
had
to
carry
him
into
the
next
room
and
put
him
to
bed
the
doctor
said
afterwards
that
he
probably
would
have
died
laughing
if
he
had
not
had
such
a
strong
constitution
all
through
the
night
he
gurgled
happily
in
his
sleep
and
even
when
we
woke
him
up
the
next
morning
he
rolled
out
of
bed
still
chuckling
returning
to
the
reception
room
we
were
shown
some
red
roots
which
long
arrow
told
us
had
the
property
when
made
into
a
soup
with
sugar
and
salt
of
causing
people
to
dance
with
extraordinary
speed
and
endurance
he
asked
us
to
try
them
but
we
refused
thanking
him
after
bumpo
s
exhibition
we
were
a
little
afraid
of
any
more
experiments
for
the
present
there
was
no
end
to
the
curious
and
useful
things
that
long
arrow
had
collected
an
oil
from
a
vine
which
would
make
hair
grow
in
one
night
an
orange
as
big
as
a
pumpkin
which
he
had
raised
in
his
own
in
peru
a
black
honey
he
had
brought
the
bees
that
made
it
too
and
the
seeds
of
the
flowers
they
fed
on
which
would
put
you
to
sleep
just
with
a
teaspoonful
and
make
you
wake
up
fresh
in
the
morning
a
nut
that
made
the
voice
beautiful
for
singing
a
that
stopped
cuts
from
bleeding
a
moss
that
cured
a
lichen
that
prevented
the
doctor
of
course
was
tremendously
interested
well
into
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
he
was
busy
going
over
the
articles
on
the
table
one
by
one
listing
their
names
and
writing
their
properties
and
descriptions
into
a
as
long
arrow
dictated
there
are
things
here
stubbins
he
said
as
he
ended
which
in
the
hands
of
skilled
druggists
will
make
a
vast
difference
to
the
medicine
and
chemistry
of
the
world
i
suspect
that
this
by
itself
will
take
the
place
of
half
the
bad
drugs
we
have
had
to
use
so
far
long
arrow
has
discovered
a
pharmacopæia
of
his
own
miranda
was
right
he
is
a
great
naturalist
his
name
deserves
to
be
placed
beside
linnæus
some
day
i
must
get
all
these
things
to
when
he
added
yes
that
s
the
problem
when
fourth
the
for
a
long
time
after
that
cabinet
meeting
of
which
i
have
just
told
you
we
did
not
ask
the
doctor
anything
further
about
going
home
life
in
spidermonkey
island
went
forward
month
in
month
out
busily
and
pleasantly
the
winter
with
christmas
celebrations
came
and
went
and
summer
was
with
us
once
again
before
we
knew
it
as
time
passed
the
doctor
became
more
and
more
taken
up
with
the
care
of
his
big
family
and
the
hours
he
could
spare
for
his
natural
history
work
grew
fewer
and
fewer
i
knew
that
he
often
still
thought
of
his
house
and
garden
in
puddleby
and
of
his
old
plans
and
ambitions
because
once
in
a
while
we
would
notice
his
face
grow
thoughtful
and
a
little
sad
when
something
reminded
him
of
england
or
his
old
life
but
he
never
spoke
of
these
things
and
i
truly
believe
he
would
have
spent
the
remainder
of
his
days
on
spidermonkey
island
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
an
for
polynesia
the
old
parrot
had
grown
very
tired
of
the
indians
and
she
made
no
secret
of
it
the
very
idea
she
said
to
me
one
day
as
we
were
walking
on
the
the
idea
of
the
famous
john
dolittle
spending
his
valuable
life
waiting
on
these
greasy
natives
it
s
preposterous
all
that
morning
we
had
been
watching
the
doctor
superintend
the
building
of
the
new
theatre
in
was
already
an
and
a
and
finally
she
had
got
so
grouchy
and
annoyed
at
the
sight
that
i
had
suggested
her
taking
a
walk
with
me
do
you
really
think
i
asked
as
we
sat
down
on
the
sands
that
he
will
never
go
back
to
puddleby
again
i
don
t
know
said
she
at
one
time
i
felt
sure
that
the
thought
of
the
pets
he
had
left
behind
at
the
house
would
take
him
home
soon
but
since
miranda
brought
him
word
last
august
that
everything
was
all
right
there
that
hope
s
gone
for
months
and
months
i
ve
been
racking
my
brains
to
think
up
a
plan
if
we
could
only
hit
upon
something
that
would
turn
his
thoughts
back
to
natural
history
mean
something
big
enough
to
get
him
really
might
manage
it
but
how
shrugged
her
shoulders
in
how
all
he
thinks
of
now
is
paving
streets
and
teaching
papooses
that
twice
one
are
two
it
was
a
perfect
popsipetel
day
bright
and
hot
blue
and
yellow
drowsily
i
looked
out
to
sea
thinking
of
my
mother
and
father
i
wondered
if
they
were
getting
anxious
over
my
long
absence
beside
me
old
polynesia
went
on
grumbling
away
in
low
steady
tones
and
her
words
began
to
mingle
and
mix
with
the
gentle
lapping
of
the
waves
upon
the
shore
it
may
have
been
the
even
murmur
of
her
voice
helped
by
the
soft
and
balmy
air
that
lulled
me
to
sleep
i
don
t
know
anyhow
i
presently
dreamed
that
the
island
had
moved
floatingly
as
before
but
suddenly
jerkily
as
though
something
enormously
powerful
had
heaved
it
up
from
its
bed
just
once
and
let
it
down
how
long
i
slept
after
that
i
have
no
idea
i
was
awakened
by
a
gentle
pecking
on
the
nose
tommy
it
was
polynesia
s
voice
wake
up
what
a
boy
to
sleep
through
an
earthquake
and
never
notice
it
listen
here
s
our
chance
now
wake
for
goodness
sake
what
s
the
matter
i
asked
sitting
up
with
a
yawn
sh
whispered
polynesia
pointing
out
to
sea
still
only
half
awake
i
stared
before
me
with
bleary
eyes
and
in
the
shallow
water
not
more
than
thirty
yards
from
shore
i
saw
an
enormous
pale
pink
shell
it
towered
up
in
a
graceful
rainbow
curve
to
a
tremendous
height
and
round
its
base
the
surf
broke
gently
in
little
waves
of
white
it
could
have
belonged
to
the
wildest
dream
what
in
the
world
is
it
i
asked
that
whispered
polynesia
is
what
sailors
for
hundreds
of
years
have
called
the
i
ve
seen
it
myself
more
than
once
from
the
decks
of
ships
at
long
range
curving
in
and
out
of
the
water
but
now
that
i
see
it
close
and
still
i
very
strongly
suspect
that
the
of
history
is
no
other
than
the
great
glass
that
the
fidgit
told
us
of
if
that
isn
t
the
only
fish
of
its
kind
in
the
seven
seas
call
me
a
we
re
in
luck
our
job
is
to
get
the
doctor
down
here
to
look
at
that
prize
specimen
before
it
moves
off
to
the
deep
hole
if
we
can
then
trust
me
we
may
leave
this
blessed
island
yet
you
stay
here
and
keep
an
eye
on
it
while
i
go
after
the
doctor
don
t
move
or
t
even
breathe
heavy
he
might
get
timid
things
snails
just
watch
him
and
i
ll
be
back
in
two
stealthily
creeping
up
the
sands
till
she
could
get
behind
the
cover
of
some
bushes
before
she
took
to
her
wings
polynesia
went
off
in
the
direction
of
the
town
while
i
remained
alone
upon
the
shore
fascinatedly
watching
this
unbelievable
monster
wallowing
in
the
shallow
sea
it
moved
very
little
from
time
to
time
it
lifted
its
head
out
of
the
water
showing
its
enormously
long
neck
and
horns
occasionally
it
would
try
and
draw
itself
up
the
way
a
snail
does
when
he
goes
to
move
but
almost
at
once
it
would
sink
down
again
as
if
exhausted
it
seemed
to
me
to
act
as
though
it
were
hurt
underneath
but
the
lower
part
of
it
which
was
below
the
level
of
the
water
i
could
not
see
i
was
still
absorbed
in
watching
the
great
beast
when
polynesia
returned
with
the
doctor
they
approached
so
silently
and
so
cautiously
that
i
neither
saw
nor
heard
them
coming
till
i
found
them
crouching
beside
me
on
the
sand
one
sight
of
the
snail
changed
the
doctor
completely
his
eyes
just
sparkled
with
delight
i
had
not
seen
him
so
thrilled
and
happy
since
the
time
we
caught
the
jabizri
beetle
when
we
first
landed
on
the
island
it
is
he
he
the
great
glass
a
doubt
of
it
polynesia
go
down
the
shore
a
way
and
see
if
you
can
find
any
of
the
porpoises
for
me
perhaps
they
can
tell
us
what
the
snail
is
doing
s
very
unusual
for
him
to
be
in
shallow
water
like
this
and
stubbins
you
go
over
to
the
harbor
and
bring
me
a
small
canoe
but
be
most
careful
how
you
paddle
it
round
into
this
bay
if
the
snail
should
take
fright
and
go
out
into
the
deeper
water
we
may
never
get
a
chance
to
see
him
and
don
t
tell
any
of
the
indians
polynesia
added
in
a
whisper
as
i
moved
to
go
we
must
keep
this
a
secret
or
we
ll
have
a
crowd
of
sightseers
round
here
in
five
minutes
it
s
mighty
lucky
we
found
the
snail
in
a
quiet
reaching
the
harbor
i
picked
out
a
small
light
canoe
from
among
the
number
that
were
lying
there
and
without
telling
any
one
what
i
wanted
it
for
got
in
and
started
off
to
paddle
it
down
the
shore
i
was
mortally
afraid
that
the
snail
might
have
left
before
i
got
back
and
you
can
imagine
how
delighted
i
was
when
i
rounded
a
rocky
cape
and
came
in
sight
of
the
bay
to
find
he
was
still
there
polynesia
i
saw
had
got
her
errand
done
and
returned
ahead
of
me
bringing
with
her
a
pair
of
porpoises
these
were
already
conversing
in
low
tones
with
john
dolittle
i
beached
the
canoe
and
went
up
to
listen
what
i
want
to
know
the
doctor
was
saying
is
how
the
snail
comes
to
be
here
i
was
given
to
understand
that
he
usually
stayed
in
the
deep
hole
and
that
when
he
did
come
to
the
surface
it
was
always
in
oh
didn
t
you
know
t
you
heard
the
porpoises
replied
you
covered
up
the
deep
hole
when
you
sank
the
island
why
yes
you
let
it
down
right
on
top
of
the
mouth
of
the
of
put
the
lid
on
as
it
were
the
fishes
that
were
in
it
at
the
time
have
been
trying
to
get
out
ever
since
the
great
snail
had
the
worst
luck
of
all
the
island
nipped
him
by
the
tail
just
as
he
was
leaving
the
hole
for
a
quiet
evening
stroll
and
he
was
held
there
for
six
months
trying
to
wriggle
himself
free
finally
he
had
to
heave
the
whole
island
up
at
one
end
to
get
his
tail
loose
didn
t
you
feel
a
sort
of
an
earthquake
shock
about
an
hour
ago
yes
i
did
said
the
doctor
it
shook
down
part
of
the
theatre
i
was
well
that
was
the
snail
heaving
up
the
island
to
get
out
of
the
hole
they
said
all
the
other
fishes
saw
their
chance
and
escaped
when
he
raised
the
lid
it
was
lucky
for
them
he
s
so
big
and
strong
but
the
strain
of
that
terrific
heave
told
on
him
he
sprained
a
muscle
in
his
tail
and
it
started
swelling
rather
badly
he
wanted
some
quiet
place
to
rest
up
and
seeing
this
soft
beach
handy
he
crawled
in
dear
me
said
the
doctor
i
m
terribly
sorry
i
suppose
i
should
have
given
some
sort
of
notice
that
the
island
was
going
to
be
let
down
but
to
tell
the
truth
we
didn
t
know
it
ourselves
it
happened
by
a
kind
of
an
accident
do
you
imagine
the
poor
fellow
is
hurt
very
badly
we
re
not
sure
said
the
porpoises
because
none
of
us
can
speak
his
language
but
we
swam
right
around
him
on
our
way
in
here
and
he
did
not
seem
to
be
really
seriously
can
t
any
of
your
people
speak
shellfish
the
doctor
asked
not
a
word
said
they
it
s
a
most
frightfully
difficult
do
you
think
that
you
might
be
able
to
find
me
some
kind
of
a
fish
that
could
we
don
t
know
said
the
porpoises
we
might
i
should
be
extremely
grateful
to
you
if
you
would
said
the
doctor
there
are
many
important
questions
i
want
to
ask
this
besides
i
would
like
to
do
my
best
to
cure
his
tail
for
him
it
s
the
least
i
can
do
after
all
it
was
my
fault
indirectly
that
he
got
well
if
you
wait
here
said
the
porpoises
we
ll
see
what
can
be
fifth
the
shellfish
riddle
solved
at
last
so
doctor
dolittle
with
a
crown
on
his
head
sat
down
upon
the
shore
like
king
knut
and
waited
and
for
a
whole
hour
the
porpoises
kept
going
and
coming
bringing
up
different
kinds
of
from
the
deep
to
see
if
they
could
help
him
many
and
curious
were
the
creatures
they
produced
it
would
seem
however
that
there
were
very
few
things
that
spoke
shellfish
except
the
shellfish
themselves
still
the
porpoises
grew
a
little
more
hopeful
when
they
discovered
a
very
old
a
funny
little
fellow
with
long
whiskers
all
over
him
who
said
he
could
not
speak
pure
shellfish
but
he
used
to
understand
to
get
he
was
young
this
was
coming
nearer
even
if
it
wasn
t
anything
to
go
crazy
about
leaving
the
urchin
with
us
the
porpoises
went
off
once
more
to
hunt
up
a
starfish
they
were
not
long
getting
one
for
they
were
quite
common
in
those
parts
then
using
the
as
an
interpreter
they
questioned
the
starfish
he
was
a
rather
stupid
sort
of
creature
but
he
tried
his
best
to
be
helpful
and
after
a
little
patient
examination
we
found
to
our
delight
that
he
could
speak
shellfish
moderately
well
feeling
quite
encouraged
the
doctor
and
i
now
got
into
the
canoe
and
with
the
porpoises
the
urchin
and
the
starfish
swimming
alongside
we
paddled
very
gently
out
till
we
were
close
under
the
towering
shell
of
the
great
snail
and
then
began
the
most
curious
conversation
i
have
ever
witnessed
first
the
starfish
would
ask
the
snail
something
and
whatever
answer
the
snail
gave
the
starfish
would
tell
it
to
the
the
urchin
would
tell
it
to
the
porpoises
and
the
porpoises
would
tell
it
to
the
doctor
in
this
way
we
obtained
considerable
information
mostly
about
the
very
ancient
history
of
the
animal
kingdom
but
we
missed
a
good
many
of
the
finer
points
in
the
snail
s
longer
speeches
on
account
of
the
stupidity
of
the
starfish
and
all
this
translating
from
one
language
to
another
while
the
snail
was
speaking
the
doctor
and
i
put
our
ears
against
the
wall
of
his
shell
and
found
that
we
could
in
this
way
hear
the
sound
of
his
voice
quite
plainly
it
was
as
the
fidgit
had
described
deep
and
but
of
course
we
could
not
understand
a
single
word
he
said
however
the
doctor
was
by
this
time
terrifically
excited
about
getting
near
to
learning
the
language
he
had
sought
so
long
and
presently
by
making
the
other
fishes
repeat
over
and
over
again
short
phrases
which
the
snail
used
he
began
to
put
words
together
for
himself
you
see
he
was
already
familiar
with
one
or
two
fish
languages
and
that
helped
him
quite
a
little
after
he
had
practised
for
a
while
like
this
he
leant
over
the
side
of
the
canoe
and
putting
his
face
below
the
water
tried
speaking
to
the
snail
direct
it
was
hard
and
difficult
work
and
hours
went
by
before
he
got
any
results
but
presently
i
could
tell
by
the
happy
look
on
his
face
that
little
by
little
he
was
succeeding
the
sun
was
low
in
the
west
and
the
cool
evening
breeze
was
beginning
to
rustle
softly
through
the
when
the
doctor
finally
turned
from
his
work
and
said
to
me
stubbins
i
have
persuaded
the
snail
to
come
in
on
to
the
dry
part
of
the
beach
and
let
me
examine
his
tail
will
you
please
go
back
to
the
town
and
tell
the
workmen
to
stop
working
on
the
theatre
for
then
go
on
to
the
palace
and
get
my
i
think
i
left
it
under
the
throne
in
the
audience
and
remember
polynesia
whispered
as
i
turned
away
not
a
word
to
a
soul
if
you
get
asked
questions
keep
your
mouth
shut
pretend
you
have
a
toothache
or
this
time
when
i
got
back
to
the
the
found
the
snail
high
and
dry
on
the
beach
seeing
him
in
his
full
length
like
this
it
was
easy
to
understand
how
superstitious
sailors
had
called
him
the
he
certainly
was
a
most
gigantic
and
in
his
way
a
graceful
beautiful
creature
john
dolittle
was
examining
a
swelling
on
his
tail
from
the
bag
which
i
had
brought
the
doctor
took
a
large
bottle
of
embrocation
and
began
rubbing
the
sprain
next
he
took
all
the
bandages
he
had
in
the
bag
and
fastened
them
end
to
end
but
even
like
that
they
were
not
long
enough
to
go
more
than
halfway
round
the
enormous
tail
the
doctor
insisted
that
he
must
get
the
swelling
strapped
tight
somehow
so
he
sent
me
off
to
the
palace
once
more
to
get
all
the
sheets
from
the
royal
these
polynesia
and
i
tore
into
bandages
for
him
and
at
last
after
terrific
exertions
we
got
the
sprain
strapped
to
his
satisfaction
the
snail
really
seemed
to
be
quite
pleased
with
the
attention
he
had
received
and
he
stretched
himself
in
lazy
comfort
when
the
doctor
was
done
in
this
position
when
the
shell
on
his
back
was
empty
you
could
look
right
through
it
and
see
the
on
the
other
side
i
think
one
of
us
had
better
sit
up
with
him
all
night
said
the
doctor
we
might
put
bumpo
on
that
duty
he
s
been
napping
all
day
i
the
it
s
a
pretty
bad
sprain
that
and
if
the
snail
shouldn
t
be
able
to
sleep
he
ll
be
happier
with
some
one
with
him
for
company
he
ll
get
all
right
a
few
days
i
should
judge
if
i
wasn
t
so
confoundedly
busy
i
d
sit
up
with
him
myself
i
wish
i
could
because
i
still
have
a
lot
of
things
to
talk
over
with
but
doctor
said
polynesia
as
we
prepared
to
go
back
to
the
town
you
ought
to
take
a
holiday
all
kings
take
holidays
once
in
the
one
of
them
king
charles
for
course
charles
was
before
your
he
he
was
not
that
he
was
ever
what
you
would
call
a
model
king
but
just
the
same
he
was
frightfully
popular
everybody
liked
the
in
the
at
hampton
court
as
a
king
the
only
thing
i
had
against
him
was
his
inventing
those
stupid
little
snappy
dogs
they
call
king
charles
spaniels
there
are
lots
of
stories
told
about
poor
charles
but
that
in
my
opinion
is
the
worst
thing
he
did
however
all
this
is
beside
the
point
as
i
was
saying
kings
have
to
take
holidays
the
same
as
anybody
else
and
you
haven
t
taken
one
since
you
were
crowned
have
you
now
no
said
the
doctor
i
suppose
that
s
well
now
i
tell
you
what
you
do
said
she
as
soon
as
you
get
back
to
the
palace
you
publish
a
royal
proclamation
that
you
are
going
away
for
a
week
into
the
country
for
your
health
and
you
re
going
any
you
like
a
plain
person
it
s
called
traveling
incognito
when
kings
go
off
like
that
they
all
do
s
the
only
way
they
can
ever
have
a
good
time
then
the
week
you
re
away
you
can
spend
lolling
on
the
beach
back
there
with
the
snail
how
s
that
i
d
like
to
said
the
doctor
it
sounds
most
attractive
but
there
s
that
new
theatre
to
be
built
none
of
our
carpenters
would
know
how
to
get
those
rafters
on
without
me
to
show
then
there
are
the
babies
these
native
mothers
are
so
frightfully
oh
bother
the
the
babies
too
snapped
polynesia
the
theatre
can
wait
a
week
and
as
for
babies
they
never
have
anything
more
than
colic
how
do
you
suppose
babies
got
along
before
you
came
here
for
heaven
s
sake
a
holiday
you
need
sixth
the
last
cabinet
meeting
from
the
way
polynesia
talked
i
guessed
that
this
idea
of
a
holiday
was
part
of
her
plan
the
doctor
made
no
reply
and
we
walked
on
silently
towards
the
town
i
could
see
nevertheless
that
her
words
had
made
an
impression
on
him
after
supper
he
disappeared
from
the
palace
without
saying
where
he
was
thing
he
had
never
done
before
of
course
we
all
knew
where
he
had
gone
back
to
the
beach
to
sit
up
with
the
snail
we
were
sure
of
it
because
he
had
said
nothing
to
bumpo
about
attending
to
the
matter
as
soon
as
the
doors
were
closed
upon
the
cabinet
meeting
that
night
polynesia
addressed
the
ministry
look
here
you
fellows
said
she
we
ve
simply
got
to
get
the
doctor
to
take
this
holiday
we
re
willing
to
stay
in
this
blessed
island
for
the
rest
of
our
but
what
difference
bumpo
asked
is
his
taking
a
holiday
going
to
make
impatiently
polynesia
turned
upon
the
minister
of
the
interior
don
t
you
see
if
he
has
a
clear
week
to
get
thoroughly
interested
in
his
natural
history
stuff
his
dream
of
seeing
the
floor
of
the
ocean
and
all
may
be
some
chance
of
his
consenting
to
leave
this
pesky
place
but
while
he
is
here
on
duty
as
king
he
never
gets
a
moment
to
think
of
anything
outside
of
the
business
of
yes
that
s
true
he
s
far
too
consententious
bumpo
agreed
and
besides
polynesia
went
on
his
only
hope
of
ever
getting
away
from
here
would
be
to
escape
secretly
he
s
got
to
leave
while
he
is
no
one
knows
where
he
is
or
what
he
s
doing
but
us
if
he
built
a
ship
big
enough
to
cross
the
sea
in
all
the
indians
would
see
it
and
hear
it
being
built
and
they
d
ask
what
it
was
for
they
would
interfere
they
d
sooner
have
anything
happen
than
lose
the
doctor
why
i
believe
if
they
thought
he
had
any
idea
of
escaping
they
would
put
chains
on
yes
i
really
think
they
would
i
agreed
yet
without
a
ship
of
some
kind
i
don
t
see
how
the
doctor
is
going
to
get
away
even
well
i
ll
tell
you
said
polynesia
if
we
do
succeed
in
making
him
take
this
holiday
our
next
step
will
be
to
get
the
to
promise
to
take
us
all
in
his
shell
and
carry
us
to
the
mouth
of
puddleby
river
if
we
can
once
get
the
snail
willing
the
temptation
will
be
too
much
for
john
dolittle
and
he
ll
come
i
as
he
ll
be
able
to
take
those
new
plants
and
drugs
of
long
arrow
s
to
the
english
doctors
as
well
as
see
the
floor
of
the
ocean
on
the
how
thrilling
i
cried
do
you
mean
the
snail
could
take
us
under
the
sea
all
the
way
back
to
puddleby
certainly
said
polynesia
a
little
trip
like
that
is
nothing
to
him
he
would
crawl
along
the
floor
of
the
ocean
and
the
doctor
could
see
all
the
sights
perfectly
simple
oh
john
dolittle
will
come
all
right
if
we
can
only
get
him
to
take
that
if
the
snail
will
consent
to
give
us
the
golly
i
hope
he
does
sighed
jip
i
m
sick
of
these
beastly
make
you
feel
so
lazy
and
and
there
are
no
rats
or
anything
that
a
fellow
would
have
the
energy
to
chase
em
even
if
there
were
my
wouldn
t
i
be
glad
to
see
old
puddleby
and
the
garden
again
and
won
t
be
glad
to
have
us
back
by
the
end
of
next
month
said
i
it
will
be
two
whole
years
since
we
left
we
pulled
up
the
anchor
at
kingsbridge
and
bumped
our
way
out
into
the
and
got
stuck
on
the
added
in
a
dreamy
voice
do
you
remember
how
all
the
people
waved
to
us
from
the
i
asked
yes
and
i
suppose
they
ve
often
talked
about
us
in
the
town
since
said
wondering
whether
we
re
dead
or
cease
said
bumpo
i
feel
i
am
about
to
weep
from
seventh
the
doctor
s
decision
well
you
can
guess
how
glad
we
were
when
next
morning
the
doctor
after
his
conversation
with
the
snail
told
us
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
take
the
holiday
a
proclamation
was
published
right
away
by
the
town
crier
that
his
majesty
was
going
into
the
country
for
a
rest
but
that
during
his
absence
the
palace
and
the
government
offices
would
be
kept
open
as
usual
polynesia
was
immensely
pleased
she
at
once
set
quietly
to
work
making
arrangements
for
our
good
care
the
while
that
no
one
should
get
an
inkling
of
where
we
were
going
what
we
were
taking
with
us
the
hour
of
our
leaving
or
which
of
the
we
would
go
out
by
cunning
old
schemer
that
she
was
she
forgot
nothing
and
not
even
we
who
were
of
the
doctor
s
party
could
imagine
what
reasons
she
had
for
some
of
her
preparations
she
took
me
inside
and
told
me
that
the
one
thing
i
must
remember
to
bring
with
me
was
of
the
doctor
s
long
arrow
who
was
the
only
indian
let
into
the
secret
of
our
destination
said
he
would
like
to
come
with
us
as
far
as
the
beach
to
see
the
great
snail
and
him
polynesia
told
to
be
sure
and
bring
his
collection
of
plants
bumpo
she
ordered
to
carry
the
doctor
s
high
hidden
under
his
coat
she
sent
off
nearly
all
the
footmen
who
were
on
night
duty
to
do
errands
in
the
town
so
that
there
should
be
as
few
servants
as
possible
to
see
us
leave
and
midnight
the
hour
when
most
of
the
townspeople
would
be
asleep
she
finally
chose
for
our
departure
we
had
to
take
a
week
s
with
us
for
the
royal
holiday
so
with
our
other
packages
we
were
heavy
laden
when
on
the
stroke
of
twelve
we
opened
the
west
door
of
the
palace
and
stepped
cautiously
and
quietly
into
the
moonlit
garden
tiptoe
incognito
whispered
bumpo
as
we
gently
closed
the
heavy
doors
behind
us
no
one
had
seen
us
leave
at
the
foot
of
the
stone
steps
leading
from
the
peacock
terrace
to
the
sunken
rosary
something
made
me
pause
and
look
back
at
the
magnificent
palace
which
we
had
built
in
this
strange
land
where
no
white
men
but
ourselves
had
ever
come
somehow
i
felt
it
in
my
bones
that
we
were
leaving
it
never
to
return
again
and
i
wondered
what
other
kings
and
ministers
would
dwell
in
its
splendid
halls
when
we
were
gone
the
air
was
hot
and
everything
was
deadly
still
but
for
the
gentle
splashing
of
the
tame
flamingoes
paddling
in
the
suddenly
the
twinkling
lantern
of
a
night
watchman
appeared
round
the
corner
of
a
cypress
hedge
polynesia
plucked
at
my
stocking
and
in
an
impatient
whisper
bade
me
hurry
before
our
flight
be
discovered
on
our
arrival
at
the
beach
we
found
the
snail
already
feeling
much
better
and
now
able
to
move
his
tail
without
pain
the
porpoises
who
are
by
nature
inquisitive
creatures
were
still
hanging
about
in
the
offing
to
see
if
anything
of
interest
was
going
to
happen
polynesia
the
plotter
while
the
doctor
was
occupied
with
his
new
patient
signaled
to
them
and
drew
them
aside
for
a
little
private
chat
now
see
here
my
friends
said
she
speaking
low
you
know
how
much
john
dolittle
has
done
for
the
his
whole
life
up
to
them
one
might
say
well
here
is
your
chance
to
do
something
for
him
listen
he
got
made
king
of
this
island
against
his
will
see
and
now
that
he
has
taken
the
job
on
he
feels
that
he
can
t
leave
the
indians
won
t
be
able
to
get
along
without
him
and
all
is
nonsense
as
you
and
i
very
well
know
all
right
then
here
s
the
point
if
this
snail
were
only
willing
to
take
him
and
a
little
very
much
thirty
or
forty
pieces
his
shell
and
carry
us
to
england
we
feel
sure
that
the
doctor
would
go
because
he
s
just
crazy
to
mess
about
on
the
floor
of
the
ocean
what
s
more
this
would
be
his
one
and
only
chance
of
escape
from
the
island
now
it
is
highly
important
that
the
doctor
return
to
his
own
country
to
carry
on
his
proper
work
which
means
such
a
lot
to
the
animals
of
the
world
so
what
we
want
you
to
do
is
to
tell
the
to
tell
the
starfish
to
tell
the
snail
to
take
us
in
his
shell
and
carry
us
to
puddleby
river
is
that
plain
illustration
tiptoe
incognito
whispered
bumpo
quite
quite
said
the
porpoises
and
we
will
willingly
do
our
very
best
to
persuade
it
is
as
you
say
a
perfect
shame
for
the
great
man
to
be
wasting
his
time
here
when
he
is
so
much
needed
by
the
and
don
t
let
the
doctor
know
what
you
re
about
said
polynesia
as
they
started
to
move
off
he
might
balk
if
he
thought
we
had
any
hand
in
it
get
the
snail
to
offer
on
his
own
account
to
take
us
see
john
dolittle
unaware
of
anything
save
the
work
he
was
engaged
on
was
standing
in
the
shallow
water
helping
the
snail
try
out
his
mended
tail
to
see
if
it
were
well
enough
to
travel
on
bumpo
and
long
arrow
with
and
jip
were
lolling
at
the
foot
of
a
palm
a
little
way
up
the
beach
polynesia
and
i
now
went
and
joined
them
half
an
hour
passed
what
success
the
porpoises
had
met
with
we
did
not
know
till
suddenly
the
doctor
left
the
snail
s
side
and
came
splashing
out
to
us
quite
breathless
what
you
think
he
cried
while
i
was
talking
to
the
snail
just
now
he
offered
of
his
own
accord
to
take
us
all
back
to
england
inside
his
shell
he
says
he
has
got
to
go
on
a
voyage
of
discovery
anyway
to
hunt
up
a
new
home
now
that
the
deep
hole
is
closed
said
it
wouldn
t
be
much
out
of
his
way
to
drop
us
at
puddleby
river
if
we
cared
to
come
what
a
chance
i
d
love
to
go
to
examine
the
floor
of
the
ocean
all
the
way
from
brazil
to
europe
no
man
ever
did
it
before
what
a
glorious
trip
that
i
had
never
allowed
myself
to
be
made
king
now
i
must
see
the
chance
of
a
lifetime
slip
he
turned
from
us
and
moved
down
the
sands
again
to
the
middle
beach
gazing
wistfully
longingly
out
at
the
snail
there
was
something
peculiarly
sad
and
forlorn
about
him
as
he
stood
there
on
the
lonely
moonlit
shore
the
crown
upon
his
head
his
figure
showing
sharply
black
against
the
glittering
sea
behind
out
of
the
darkness
at
my
elbow
polynesia
rose
and
quietly
moved
down
to
his
side
now
doctor
said
she
in
a
soft
persuasive
voice
as
though
she
were
talking
to
a
wayward
child
you
know
this
king
business
is
not
your
real
work
in
life
these
natives
will
be
able
to
get
along
without
so
well
as
they
do
with
you
of
they
ll
same
as
they
did
before
you
came
nobody
can
say
you
haven
t
done
your
duty
by
them
it
was
their
fault
they
made
you
king
why
not
accept
the
snail
s
offer
and
just
drop
everything
now
and
go
the
work
you
ll
do
the
information
you
ll
carry
home
will
be
of
far
more
value
than
what
you
re
doing
good
friend
said
the
doctor
turning
to
her
sadly
i
can
not
they
would
go
back
to
their
old
unsanitary
ways
bad
water
uncooked
fish
no
drainage
enteric
fever
and
the
rest
no
i
must
think
of
their
health
their
welfare
i
began
life
as
a
people
s
doctor
i
seem
to
have
come
back
to
it
in
the
end
i
can
not
desert
them
later
perhaps
something
will
turn
up
but
i
can
not
leave
them
that
s
where
you
re
wrong
doctor
said
she
now
is
when
you
should
go
nothing
will
turn
the
longer
you
stay
the
harder
it
will
be
to
now
go
what
steal
away
without
even
saying
to
them
why
polynesia
what
a
thing
to
suggest
a
fat
chance
they
would
give
you
to
say
snorted
polynesia
growing
impatient
at
last
i
tell
you
doctor
if
you
go
back
to
that
palace
tonight
for
goodbys
or
anything
else
you
will
stay
there
the
time
for
you
to
the
truth
of
the
old
parrot
s
words
seemed
to
be
striking
home
for
the
doctor
stood
silent
a
minute
thinking
but
there
are
the
he
said
presently
i
would
have
to
go
back
to
fetch
i
have
them
here
doctor
said
i
speaking
all
of
again
he
pondered
and
long
arrow
s
collection
he
said
i
would
have
to
take
that
also
with
it
is
here
oh
kindly
one
came
the
indian
s
deep
voice
from
the
shadow
beneath
the
palm
but
what
about
provisions
asked
the
food
for
the
journey
we
have
a
week
s
supply
with
us
for
our
holiday
said
that
s
more
than
we
will
for
a
third
time
the
doctor
was
silent
and
thoughtful
and
then
there
s
my
hat
he
said
fretfully
at
last
that
settles
it
i
ll
to
go
back
to
the
palace
i
can
t
leave
without
my
hat
how
could
i
appear
in
puddleby
with
this
crown
on
my
head
here
it
is
doctor
said
bumpo
producing
the
hat
old
battered
and
beloved
from
under
his
coat
polynesia
had
indeed
thought
of
everything
yet
even
now
we
could
see
the
doctor
was
still
trying
to
think
up
further
excuses
oh
kindly
one
said
long
arrow
why
tempt
ill
fortune
your
way
is
clear
your
future
and
your
work
beckon
you
back
to
your
foreign
home
beyond
the
sea
with
you
will
go
also
what
lore
i
too
have
gathered
for
lands
where
it
will
be
of
wider
use
than
it
can
ever
here
i
see
the
glimmerings
of
dawn
in
the
eastern
heaven
day
is
at
hand
go
before
your
subjects
are
abroad
go
before
your
project
is
discovered
for
truly
i
believe
that
if
you
go
not
now
you
will
linger
the
remainder
of
your
days
a
captive
king
in
great
decisions
often
take
no
more
than
a
moment
in
the
making
against
the
now
paling
sky
i
saw
the
doctor
s
figure
suddenly
stiffen
slowly
he
lifted
the
sacred
crown
from
off
his
head
and
laid
it
on
the
sands
and
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
choked
with
tears
they
will
find
it
here
he
murmured
when
they
come
to
search
for
me
and
they
will
know
that
i
have
gone
my
children
my
poor
children
wonder
will
they
ever
understand
why
it
was
i
left
them
i
wonder
will
they
ever
he
took
his
old
hat
from
bumpo
then
facing
long
arrow
gripped
his
outstretched
hand
in
silence
you
decide
aright
oh
kindly
one
said
the
though
none
will
miss
and
mourn
you
more
than
long
arrow
the
son
of
golden
and
may
good
fortune
ever
lead
you
by
the
hand
it
was
the
first
and
only
time
i
ever
saw
the
doctor
weep
without
a
word
to
any
of
us
he
turned
and
moved
down
the
beach
into
the
shallow
water
of
the
sea
the
snail
humped
up
its
back
and
made
an
opening
between
its
shoulders
and
the
edge
of
its
shell
the
doctor
clambered
up
and
passed
within
we
followed
him
after
handing
up
the
baggage
the
opening
shut
tight
with
a
whistling
suction
noise
then
turning
in
the
direction
of
the
east
the
great
creature
began
moving
smoothly
forward
down
the
slope
into
the
deeper
waters
just
as
the
swirling
dark
green
surf
was
closing
in
above
our
heads
the
big
morning
sun
popped
his
rim
up
over
the
edge
of
the
ocean
and
through
our
transparent
walls
of
pearl
we
saw
the
watery
world
about
us
suddenly
light
up
with
that
most
wondrously
colorful
of
visions
a
daybreak
beneath
the
sea
the
rest
of
the
story
of
our
homeward
voyage
is
soon
told
our
new
quarters
we
found
very
satisfactory
inside
the
spacious
shell
the
snail
s
wide
back
was
extremely
comfortable
to
sit
and
lounge
than
a
sofa
when
you
once
got
accustomed
to
the
damp
and
clammy
feeling
of
it
he
asked
us
shortly
after
we
started
if
we
wouldn
t
mind
taking
off
our
boots
as
the
hobnails
in
them
hurt
his
back
as
we
ran
excitedly
from
one
side
to
another
to
see
the
different
sights
the
motion
was
not
unpleasant
very
smooth
and
even
in
fact
but
for
the
landscape
passing
outside
you
would
not
know
on
the
level
going
that
you
were
moving
at
all
i
had
always
thought
for
some
reason
or
other
that
the
bottom
of
the
sea
was
flat
i
found
that
it
was
just
as
irregular
and
changeful
as
the
surface
of
the
dry
land
we
climbed
over
great
with
peaks
towering
above
peaks
we
threaded
our
way
through
dense
forests
of
tall
we
crossed
wide
empty
stretches
of
sandy
mud
like
vast
that
you
went
on
for
a
whole
day
with
nothing
ahead
of
you
but
a
dim
horizon
sometimes
the
scene
was
rolling
country
green
and
restful
to
the
eye
like
rich
pastures
so
that
you
almost
looked
to
see
sheep
cropping
on
these
underwater
downs
and
sometimes
the
snail
would
roll
us
forward
inside
him
like
peas
when
he
suddenly
dipped
downward
to
descend
into
some
deep
secluded
valley
with
steeply
sloping
sides
in
these
lower
levels
we
often
came
upon
the
shadowy
shapes
of
dead
ships
wrecked
and
sunk
heaven
only
knows
how
many
years
ago
and
passing
them
we
would
speak
in
hushed
whispers
like
children
seeing
monuments
in
churches
here
too
in
the
deeper
darker
waters
monstrous
fishes
feeding
quietly
in
caves
and
hollows
would
suddenly
spring
up
alarmed
at
our
approach
and
flash
away
into
the
gloom
with
the
speed
of
an
arrow
while
other
bolder
ones
all
sorts
of
unearthly
shapes
and
colors
would
come
right
up
and
peer
in
at
us
through
the
shell
i
suppose
they
think
we
are
a
sort
of
sanaquarium
said
i
d
hate
to
be
a
it
was
a
thrilling
and
show
the
doctor
wrote
or
sketched
incessantly
before
long
we
had
filled
all
the
blank
we
had
left
then
we
searched
our
pockets
for
any
odd
scraps
of
paper
on
which
to
jot
down
still
more
observations
we
even
went
through
the
used
books
a
second
time
writing
in
between
the
lines
scribbling
all
over
the
covers
back
and
front
our
greatest
difficulty
was
getting
enough
light
to
see
by
in
the
lower
waters
it
was
very
dim
on
the
third
day
we
passed
a
band
of
a
sort
of
large
marine
and
the
doctor
asked
the
snail
to
get
them
to
come
with
us
for
a
way
this
they
did
swimming
alongside
and
their
light
was
very
helpful
though
not
brilliant
how
our
giant
shellfish
found
his
way
across
that
vast
and
gloomy
world
was
a
great
puzzle
to
us
john
dolittle
asked
him
by
what
means
he
he
knew
he
was
on
the
right
road
to
puddleby
river
and
what
the
snail
said
in
reply
got
the
doctor
so
excited
that
having
no
paper
left
he
tore
out
the
lining
of
his
precious
hat
and
covered
it
with
notes
by
night
of
course
it
was
impossible
to
see
anything
and
during
the
hours
of
darkness
the
snail
used
to
swim
instead
of
crawl
when
he
did
so
he
could
travel
at
a
terrific
speed
just
by
waggling
that
long
tail
of
his
this
was
the
reason
why
we
completed
the
trip
in
so
short
a
and
a
half
days
the
air
of
our
chamber
not
having
a
change
in
the
whole
voyage
got
very
close
and
stuffy
and
for
the
first
two
days
we
all
had
headaches
but
after
that
we
got
used
to
it
and
didn
t
mind
it
in
the
least
early
in
the
afternoon
of
the
sixth
day
we
noticed
we
were
climbing
a
long
gentle
slope
as
we
went
upward
it
grew
lighter
finally
we
saw
that
the
snail
had
crawled
right
out
of
the
water
altogether
and
had
now
come
to
a
dead
stop
on
a
long
strip
of
gray
sand
behind
us
we
saw
the
surface
of
the
sea
rippled
by
the
wind
on
our
left
was
the
mouth
of
a
river
with
the
tide
running
out
while
in
front
the
low
flat
land
stretched
away
into
the
prevented
one
from
seeing
very
far
in
any
direction
a
pair
of
wild
ducks
with
craning
necks
and
whirring
wings
passed
over
us
and
disappeared
like
shadows
seaward
as
a
landscape
it
was
a
great
change
from
the
hot
brilliant
sunshine
of
popsipetel
with
the
same
whistling
suction
sound
the
snail
made
the
opening
for
us
to
crawl
out
by
as
we
stepped
down
upon
the
marshy
land
we
noticed
that
a
fine
drizzling
autumn
rain
was
falling
can
this
be
merrie

asked
bumpo
peering
into
the
doesn
t
look

us

sighed
polynesia

the
rain
off
her
feathers
this

all
can
tell
it
by
the
beastly
oh
