mutual
aid
a
factor
of
evolution
by
kropotkin
introduction
two
aspects
of
animal
life
impressed
me
most
during
the
journeys
which
i
made
in
my
youth
in
eastern
siberia
and
northern
manchuria
one
of
them
was
the
extreme
severity
of
the
struggle
for
existence
which
most
species
of
animals
have
to
carry
on
against
an
inclement
nature
the
enormous
destruction
of
life
which
periodically
results
from
natural
agencies
and
the
consequent
paucity
of
life
over
the
vast
territory
which
fell
under
my
observation
and
the
other
was
that
even
in
those
few
spots
where
animal
life
teemed
in
abundance
i
failed
to
find
although
i
was
eagerly
looking
for
it
that
bitter
struggle
for
the
means
of
existence
among
animals
belonging
to
the
same
species
which
was
considered
by
most
darwinists
though
not
always
by
darwin
himself
as
the
dominant
characteristic
of
struggle
for
life
and
the
main
factor
of
evolution
the
terrible
which
sweep
over
the
northern
portion
of
eurasia
in
the
later
part
of
the
winter
and
the
glazed
frost
that
often
follows
them
the
frosts
and
the
which
return
every
year
in
the
second
half
of
may
when
the
trees
are
already
in
full
blossom
and
insect
life
swarms
everywhere
the
early
frosts
and
occasionally
the
heavy
snowfalls
in
july
and
august
which
suddenly
destroy
myriads
of
insects
as
well
as
the
second
broods
of
the
birds
in
the
prairies
the
torrential
rains
due
to
the
monsoons
which
fall
in
more
temperate
regions
in
august
and
september
resulting
in
inundations
on
a
scale
which
is
only
known
in
america
and
in
eastern
asia
and
swamping
on
the
plateaus
areas
as
wide
as
european
states
and
finally
the
heavy
snowfalls
early
in
october
which
eventually
render
a
territory
as
large
as
france
and
germany
absolutely
impracticable
for
ruminants
and
destroy
them
by
the
thousand
these
were
the
conditions
under
which
i
saw
animal
life
struggling
in
northern
asia
they
made
me
realize
at
an
early
date
the
overwhelming
importance
in
nature
of
what
darwin
described
as
the
natural
checks
to
in
comparison
to
the
struggle
between
individuals
of
the
same
species
for
the
means
of
subsistence
which
may
go
on
here
and
there
to
some
limited
extent
but
never
attains
the
importance
of
the
former
paucity
of
life
not
being
the
distinctive
feature
of
that
immense
part
of
the
globe
which
we
name
northern
asia
i
conceived
since
then
serious
doubts
which
subsequent
study
has
only
confirmed
as
to
the
reality
of
that
fearful
competition
for
food
and
life
within
each
species
which
was
an
article
of
faith
with
most
darwinists
and
consequently
as
to
the
dominant
part
which
this
sort
of
competition
was
supposed
to
play
in
the
evolution
of
new
species
on
the
other
hand
wherever
i
saw
animal
life
in
abundance
as
for
instance
on
the
lakes
where
scores
of
species
and
millions
of
individuals
came
together
to
rear
their
progeny
in
the
colonies
of
rodents
in
the
migrations
of
birds
which
took
place
at
that
time
on
a
truly
american
scale
along
the
usuri
and
especially
in
a
migration
of
which
i
witnessed
on
the
amur
and
during
which
scores
of
thousands
of
these
intelligent
animals
came
together
from
an
immense
territory
flying
before
the
coming
deep
snow
in
order
to
cross
the
amur
where
it
is
narrowest
in
all
these
scenes
of
animal
life
which
passed
before
my
eyes
i
saw
mutual
aid
and
mutual
support
carried
on
to
an
extent
which
made
me
suspect
in
it
a
feature
of
the
greatest
importance
for
the
maintenance
of
life
the
preservation
of
each
species
and
its
further
evolution
and
finally
i
saw
among
the
cattle
and
horses
in
transbaikalia
among
the
wild
ruminants
everywhere
the
squirrels
and
so
on
that
when
animals
have
to
struggle
against
scarcity
of
food
in
consequence
of
one
of
the
causes
the
whole
of
that
portion
of
the
species
which
is
affected
by
the
calamity
comes
out
of
the
ordeal
so
much
impoverished
in
vigour
and
health
that
no
progressive
evolution
of
the
species
can
be
based
upon
such
periods
of
keen
competition
consequently
when
my
attention
was
drawn
later
on
to
the
relations
between
darwinism
and
sociology
i
could
agree
with
none
of
the
works
and
pamphlets
that
had
been
written
upon
this
important
subject
they
all
endeavoured
to
prove
that
man
owing
to
his
higher
intelligence
and
knowledge
may
mitigate
the
harshness
of
the
struggle
for
life
between
men
but
they
all
recognized
at
the
same
time
that
the
struggle
for
the
means
of
existence
of
every
animal
against
all
its
congeners
and
of
every
man
against
all
other
men
was
a
law
of
nature
this
view
however
i
could
not
accept
because
i
was
persuaded
that
to
admit
a
pitiless
inner
war
for
life
within
each
species
and
to
see
in
that
war
a
condition
of
progress
was
to
admit
something
which
not
only
had
not
yet
been
proved
but
also
lacked
confirmation
from
direct
observation
on
the
contrary
a
lecture
on
the
law
of
mutual
aid
which
was
delivered
at
a
russian
congress
of
naturalists
in
january
by
the
zoologist
professor
kessler
the
then
dean
of
the
petersburg
university
struck
me
as
throwing
a
new
light
on
the
whole
subject
kessler
idea
was
that
besides
the
law
of
mutual
struggle
there
is
in
nature
the
law
of
mutual
aid
which
for
the
success
of
the
struggle
for
life
and
especially
for
the
progressive
evolution
of
the
species
is
far
more
important
than
the
law
of
mutual
contest
this
suggestion
which
was
in
reality
nothing
but
a
further
development
of
the
ideas
expressed
by
darwin
himself
in
the
descent
of
man
seemed
to
me
so
correct
and
of
so
great
an
importance
that
since
i
became
acquainted
with
it
in
i
began
to
collect
materials
for
further
developing
the
idea
which
kessler
had
only
cursorily
sketched
in
his
lecture
but
had
not
lived
to
develop
he
died
in
in
one
point
only
i
could
not
entirely
endorse
kessler
views
kessler
alluded
to
parental
feeling
and
care
for
progeny
see
below
chapter
i
as
to
the
source
of
mutual
inclinations
in
animals
however
to
determine
how
far
these
two
feelings
have
really
been
at
work
in
the
evolution
of
sociable
instincts
and
how
far
other
instincts
have
been
at
work
in
the
same
direction
seems
to
me
a
quite
distinct
and
a
very
wide
question
which
we
hardly
can
discuss
yet
it
will
be
only
after
we
have
well
established
the
facts
of
mutual
aid
in
different
classes
of
animals
and
their
importance
for
evolution
that
we
shall
be
able
to
study
what
belongs
in
the
evolution
of
sociable
feelings
to
parental
feelings
and
what
to
sociability
proper
the
latter
having
evidently
its
origin
at
the
earliest
stages
of
the
evolution
of
the
animal
world
perhaps
even
at
the
i
consequently
directed
my
chief
attention
to
establishing
first
of
all
the
importance
of
the
mutual
aid
factor
of
evolution
leaving
to
ulterior
research
the
task
of
discovering
the
origin
of
the
mutual
aid
instinct
in
nature
the
importance
of
the
mutual
aid
factor
if
its
generality
could
only
be
demonstrated
did
not
escape
the
naturalist
genius
so
manifest
in
goethe
when
eckermann
told
once
to
goethe
it
was
in
that
two
little
which
had
run
away
from
him
were
found
by
him
next
day
in
the
nest
of
robin
redbreasts
rothkehlchen
which
fed
the
little
ones
together
with
their
own
youngsters
goethe
grew
quite
excited
about
this
fact
he
saw
in
it
a
confirmation
of
his
pantheistic
views
and
said
if
it
be
true
that
this
feeding
of
a
stranger
goes
through
all
nature
as
something
having
the
character
of
a
general
law
then
many
an
enigma
would
be
solved
he
returned
to
this
matter
on
the
next
day
and
most
earnestly
entreated
eckermann
who
was
as
is
known
a
zoologist
to
make
a
special
study
of
the
subject
adding
that
he
would
surely
come
to
quite
invaluable
treasuries
of
results
gespr√§che

of

pp
unfortunately
this
study
was
never
made
although
it
is
very
possible
that
brehm
who
has
accumulated
in
his
works
such
rich
materials
relative
to
mutual
aid
among
animals
might
have
been
inspired
by
goethe
remark
several
works
of
importance
were
published
in
the
years
dealing
with
the
intelligence
and
the
mental
life
of
animals
they
are
mentioned
in
a
footnote
in
chapter
i
of
this
book
and
three
of
them
dealt
more
especially
with
the
subject
under
consideration
namely
les
societes
animales
by
espinas
paris
la
lutte
pour
et
pout
la
lutte
a
lecture
by
lanessan
april
and
louis
buchner
book
liebe
und
in
der
thierwelt
of
which
the
first
edition
appeared
in
or
and
a
second
much
enlarged
in
but
excellent
though
each
of
these
works
is
they
leave
ample
room
for
a
work
in
which
mutual
aid
would
be
considered
not
only
as
an
argument
in
favour
of
a
origin
of
moral
instincts
but
also
as
a
law
of
nature
and
a
factor
of
evolution
espinas
devoted
his
main
attention
to
such
animal
societies
ants
bees
as
are
established
upon
a
physiological
division
of
labour
and
though
his
work
is
full
of
admirable
hints
in
all
possible
directions
it
was
written
at
a
time
when
the
evolution
of
human
societies
could
not
yet
be
treated
with
the
knowledge
we
now
possess
lanessan
lecture
has
more
the
character
of
a
brilliantly
general
plan
of
a
work
in
which
mutual
support
would
be
dealt
with
beginning
with
rocks
in
the
sea
and
then
passing
in
review
the
world
of
plants
of
animals
and
men
as
to
buchner
work
suggestive
though
it
is
and
rich
in
facts
i
could
not
agree
with
its
leading
idea
the
book
begins
with
a
hymn
to
love
and
nearly
all
its
illustrations
are
intended
to
prove
the
existence
of
love
and
sympathy
among
animals
however
to
reduce
animal
sociability
to
love
and
sympathy
means
to
reduce
its
generality
and
its
importance
just
as
human
ethics
based
upon
love
and
personal
sympathy
only
have
contributed
to
narrow
the
comprehension
of
the
moral
feeling
as
a
whole
it
is
not
love
to
my
neighbour
whom
i
often
do
not
know
at
all
which
induces
me
to
seize
a
pail
of
water
and
to
rush
towards
his
house
when
i
see
it
on
fire
it
is
a
far
wider
even
though
more
vague
feeling
or
instinct
of
human
solidarity
and
sociability
which
moves
me
so
it
is
also
with
animals
it
is
not
love
and
not
even
sympathy
understood
in
its
proper
sense
which
induces
a
herd
of
ruminants
or
of
horses
to
form
a
ring
in
order
to
resist
an
attack
of
wolves
not
love
which
induces
wolves
to
form
a
pack
for
hunting
not
love
which
induces
kittens
or
lambs
to
play
or
a
dozen
of
species
of
young
birds
to
spend
their
days
together
in
the
autumn
and
it
is
neither
love
nor
personal
sympathy
which
induces
many
thousand
scattered
over
a
territory
as
large
as
france
to
form
into
a
score
of
separate
herds
all
marching
towards
a
given
spot
in
order
to
cross
there
a
river
it
is
a
feeling
infinitely
wider
than
love
or
personal
sympathy
an
instinct
that
has
been
slowly
developed
among
animals
and
men
in
the
course
of
an
extremely
long
evolution
and
which
has
taught
animals
and
men
alike
the
force
they
can
borrow
from
the
practice
of
mutual
aid
and
support
and
the
joys
they
can
find
in
social
life
the
importance
of
this
distinction
will
be
easily
appreciated
by
the
student
of
animal
psychology
and
the
more
so
by
the
student
of
human
ethics
love
sympathy
and
certainly
play
an
immense
part
in
the
progressive
development
of
our
moral
feelings
but
it
is
not
love
and
not
even
sympathy
upon
which
society
is
based
in
mankind
it
is
the
conscience
be
it
only
at
the
stage
of
an
instinct
of
human
solidarity
it
is
the
unconscious
recognition
of
the
force
that
is
borrowed
by
each
man
from
the
practice
of
mutual
aid
of
the
close
dependency
of
every
one
happiness
upon
the
happiness
of
all
and
of
the
sense
of
justice
or
equity
which
brings
the
individual
to
consider
the
rights
of
every
other
individual
as
equal
to
his
own
upon
this
broad
and
necessary
foundation
the
still
higher
moral
feelings
are
developed
but
this
subject
lies
outside
the
scope
of
the
present
work
and
i
shall
only
indicate
here
a
lecture
justice
and
morality
which
i
delivered
in
reply
to
huxley
ethics
and
in
which
the
subject
has
been
treated
at
some
length
consequently
i
thought
that
a
book
written
on
mutual
aid
as
a
law
of
nature
and
a
factor
of
evolution
might
fill
an
important
gap
when
huxley
issued
in
his
manifesto
struggle
for
existence
and
its
bearing
upon
man
which
to
my
appreciation
was
a
very
incorrect
representation
of
the
facts
of
nature
as
one
sees
them
in
the
bush
and
in
the
forest
i
communicated
with
the
editor
of
the
nineteenth
century
asking
him
whether
he
would
give
the
hospitality
of
his
review
to
an
elaborate
reply
to
the
views
of
one
of
the
most
prominent
darwinists
and
james
knowles
received
the
proposal
with
fullest
sympathy
i
also
spoke
of
it
to
bates
yes
certainly
that
is
true
darwinism
was
his
reply
it
is
horrible
what
have
made
of
darwin
write
these
articles
and
when
they
are
printed
i
will
write
to
you
a
letter
which
you
may
publish
unfortunately
it
took
me
nearly
seven
years
to
write
these
articles
and
when
the
last
was
published
bates
was
no
longer
living
after
having
discussed
the
importance
of
mutual
aid
in
various
classes
of
animals
i
was
evidently
bound
to
discuss
the
importance
of
the
same
factor
in
the
evolution
of
man
this
was
the
more
necessary
as
there
are
a
number
of
evolutionists
who
may
not
refuse
to
admit
the
importance
of
mutual
aid
among
animals
but
who
like
herbert
spencer
will
refuse
to
admit
it
for
man
for
primitive
man
they
maintain
war
of
each
against
all
was
the
law
of
life
in
how
far
this
assertion
which
has
been
too
willingly
repeated
without
sufficient
criticism
since
the
times
of
hobbes
is
supported
by
what
we
know
about
the
early
phases
of
human
development
is
discussed
in
the
chapters
given
to
the
savages
and
the
barbarians
the
number
and
importance
of
institutions
which
were
developed
by
the
creative
genius
of
the
savage
and
masses
during
the
earliest
of
mankind
and
still
more
during
the
next
period
and
the
immense
influence
which
these
early
institutions
have
exercised
upon
the
subsequent
development
of
mankind
down
to
the
present
times
induced
me
to
extend
my
researches
to
the
later
historical
periods
as
well
especially
to
study
that
most
interesting
period
the
free
medieval
city
republics
of
which
the
universality
and
influence
upon
our
modern
civilization
have
not
yet
been
duly
appreciated
and
finally
i
have
tried
to
indicate
in
brief
the
immense
importance
which
the
instincts
inherited
by
mankind
from
its
extremely
long
evolution
play
even
now
in
our
modern
society
which
is
supposed
to
rest
upon
the
principle
every
one
for
himself
and
the
state
for
all
but
which
it
never
has
succeeded
nor
will
succeed
in
realizing
it
may
be
objected
to
this
book
that
both
animals
and
men
are
represented
in
it
under
too
favourable
an
aspect
that
their
sociable
qualities
are
insisted
upon
while
their
and
instincts
are
hardly
touched
upon
this
was
however
unavoidable
we
have
heard
so
much
lately
of
the
harsh
pitiless
struggle
for
life
which
was
said
to
be
carried
on
by
every
animal
against
all
other
animals
every
savage
against
all
other
savages
and
every
civilized
man
against
all
his
and
these
assertions
have
so
much
become
an
article
of
faith
that
it
was
necessary
first
of
all
to
oppose
to
them
a
wide
series
of
facts
showing
animal
and
human
life
under
a
quite
different
aspect
it
was
necessary
to
indicate
the
overwhelming
importance
which
sociable
habits
play
in
nature
and
in
the
progressive
evolution
of
both
the
animal
species
and
human
beings
to
prove
that
they
secure
to
animals
a
better
protection
from
their
enemies
very
often
facilities
for
getting
food
and
winter
provisions
migrations
etc
longevity
therefore
a
greater
facility
for
the
development
of
intellectual
faculties
and
that
they
have
given
to
men
in
addition
to
the
same
advantages
the
possibility
of
working
out
those
institutions
which
have
enabled
mankind
to
survive
in
its
hard
struggle
against
nature
and
to
progress
notwithstanding
all
the
vicissitudes
of
its
history
it
is
a
book
on
the
law
of
mutual
aid
viewed
at
as
one
of
the
chief
factors
of
evolution
not
on
all
factors
of
evolution
and
their
respective
values
and
this
first
book
had
to
be
written
before
the
latter
could
become
possible
i
should
certainly
be
the
last
to
underrate
the
part
which
the
of
the
individual
has
played
in
the
evolution
of
mankind
however
this
subject
requires
i
believe
a
much
deeper
treatment
than
the
one
it
has
hitherto
received
in
the
history
of
mankind
individual
has
often
been
and
continually
is
something
quite
different
from
and
far
larger
and
deeper
than
the
petty
unintelligent
which
with
a
large
class
of
writers
goes
for
individualism
and
nor
have
individuals
been
limited
to
those
whom
historians
have
represented
as
heroes
my
intention
consequently
is
if
circumstances
permit
it
to
discuss
separately
the
part
taken
by
the
of
the
individual
in
the
progressive
evolution
of
mankind
i
can
only
make
in
this
place
the
following
general
remark
when
the
mutual
aid
institutions
the
tribe
the
village
community
the
guilds
the
medieval
city
began
in
the
course
of
history
to
lose
their
primitive
character
to
be
invaded
by
parasitic
growths
and
thus
to
become
hindrances
to
progress
the
revolt
of
individuals
against
these
institutions
took
always
two
different
aspects
part
of
those
who
rose
up
strove
to
purify
the
old
institutions
or
to
work
out
a
higher
form
of
commonwealth
based
upon
the
same
mutual
aid
principles
they
tried
for
instance
to
introduce
the
principle
of
compensation
instead
of
the
lex
talionis
and
later
on
the
pardon
of
offences
or
a
still
higher
ideal
of
equality
before
the
human
conscience
in
lieu
of
compensation
according
to
but
at
the
very
same
time
another
portion
of
the
same
individual
rebels
endeavoured
to
break
down
the
protective
institutions
of
mutual
support
with
no
other
intention
but
to
increase
their
own
wealth
and
their
own
powers
in
this
contest
between
the
two
classes
of
revolted
individuals
and
the
supporters
of
what
existed
lies
the
real
tragedy
of
history
but
to
delineate
that
contest
and
honestly
to
study
the
part
played
in
the
evolution
of
mankind
by
each
one
of
these
three
forces
would
require
at
least
as
many
years
as
it
took
me
to
write
this
book
of
works
dealing
with
nearly
the
same
subject
which
have
been
published
since
the
publication
of
my
articles
on
mutual
aid
among
animals
i
must
mention
the
lowell
lectures
on
the
ascent
of
man
by
henry
drummond
london
and
the
origin
and
growth
of
the
moral
instinct
by
sutherland
london
both
are
constructed
chiefly
on
the
lines
taken
in
buchner
love
and
in
the
second
work
the
parental
and
familial
feeling
as
the
sole
influence
at
work
in
the
development
of
the
moral
feelings
has
been
dealt
with
at
some
length
a
third
work
dealing
with
man
and
written
on
similar
lines
is
the
principles
of
sociology
by
giddings
the
first
edition
of
which
was
published
in
at
new
york
and
london
and
the
leading
ideas
of
which
were
sketched
by
the
author
in
a
pamphlet
in
i
must
leave
however
to
literary
critics
the
task
of
discussing
the
points
of
contact
resemblance
or
divergence
between
these
works
and
mine
the
different
chapters
of
this
book
were
published
first
in
the
nineteenth
century
mutual

among

in
september
and
november
mutual

among
savages
in
april
mutual

among
the
barbarians
in
january
mutual

in
the
medieval
city
in
august
and
september
and
mutual
aid
amongst
modern
men
in
january
and
june
in
bringing
them
out
in
a
book
form
my
first
intention
was
to
embody
in
an
appendix
the
mass
of
materials
as
well
as
the
discussion
of
several
secondary
points
which
had
to
be
omitted
in
the
review
articles
it
appeared
however
that
the
appendix
would
double
the
size
of
the
book
and
i
was
compelled
to
abandon
or
at
least
to
postpone
its
publication
the
present
appendix
includes
the
discussion
of
only
a
few
points
which
have
been
the
matter
of
scientific
controversy
during
the
last
few
years
and
into
the
text
i
have
introduced
only
such
matter
as
could
be
introduced
without
altering
the
structure
of
the
work
i
am
glad
of
this
opportunity
for
expressing
to
the
editor
of
the
nineteenth
century
james
knowles
my
very
best
thanks
both
for
the
kind
hospitality
which
he
offered
to
these
papers
in
his
review
as
soon
as
he
knew
their
general
idea
and
the
permission
he
kindly
gave
me
to
reprint
them

the
conception
of
struggle
for
existence
as
a
factor
of
evolution
introduced
into
science
by
darwin
and
wallace
has
permitted
us
to
embrace
an
immensely
wide
range
of
phenomena
in
one
single
generalization
which
soon
became
the
very
basis
of
our
philosophical
biological
and
sociological
speculations
an
immense
variety
of
facts
adaptations
of
function
and
structure
of
organic
beings
to
their
surroundings
physiological
and
anatomical
evolution
intellectual
progress
and
moral
development
itself
which
we
formerly
used
to
explain
by
so
many
different
causes
were
embodied
by
darwin
in
one
general
conception
we
understood
them
as
continued
endeavours
as
a
struggle
against
adverse
circumstances
for
such
a
development
of
individuals
races
species
and
societies
as
would
result
in
the
greatest
possible
fulness
variety
and
intensity
of
life
it
may
be
that
at
the
outset
darwin
himself
was
not
fully
aware
of
the
generality
of
the
factor
which
he
first
invoked
for
explaining
one
series
only
of
facts
relative
to
the
accumulation
of
individual
variations
in
incipient
species
but
he
foresaw
that
the
term
which
he
was
introducing
into
science
would
lose
its
philosophical
and
its
only
true
meaning
if
it
were
to
be
used
in
its
narrow
sense
only
that
of
a
struggle
between
separate
individuals
for
the
sheer
means
of
existence
and
at
the
very
beginning
of
his
memorable
work
he
insisted
upon
the
term
being
taken
in
its
large
and
metaphorical
sense
including
dependence
of
one
being
on
another
and
including
which
is
more
important
not
only
the
life
of
the
individual
but
success
in
leaving
progeny
while
he
himself
was
chiefly
using
the
term
in
its
narrow
sense
for
his
own
special
purpose
he
warned
his
followers
against
committing
the
error
which
he
seems
once
to
have
committed
himself
of
overrating
its
narrow
meaning
in
the
descent
of
man
he
gave
some
powerful
pages
to
illustrate
its
proper
wide
sense
he
pointed
out
how
in
numberless
animal
societies
the
struggle
between
separate
individuals
for
the
means
of
existence
disappears
how
struggle
is
replaced
by
and
how
that
substitution
results
in
the
development
of
intellectual
and
moral
faculties
which
secure
to
the
species
the
best
conditions
for
survival
he
intimated
that
in
such
cases
the
fittest
are
not
the
physically
strongest
nor
the
cunningest
but
those
who
learn
to
combine
so
as
mutually
to
support
each
other
strong
and
weak
alike
for
the
welfare
of
the
community
those
communities
he
wrote
which
included
the
greatest
number
of
the
most
sympathetic
members
would
flourish
best
and
rear
the
greatest
number
of
offspring
the
term
which
originated
from
the
narrow
malthusian
conception
of
competition
between
each
and
all
thus
lost
its
narrowness
in
the
mind
of
one
who
knew
nature
unhappily
these
remarks
which
might
have
become
the
basis
of
most
fruitful
researches
were
overshadowed
by
the
masses
of
facts
gathered
for
the
purpose
of
illustrating
the
consequences
of
a
real
competition
for
life
besides
darwin
never
attempted
to
submit
to
a
closer
investigation
the
relative
importance
of
the
two
aspects
under
which
the
struggle
for
existence
appears
in
the
animal
world
and
he
never
wrote
the
work
he
proposed
to
write
upon
the
natural
checks
to
although
that
work
would
have
been
the
crucial
test
for
appreciating
the
real
purport
of
individual
struggle
nay
on
the
very
pages
just
mentioned
amidst
data
disproving
the
narrow
malthusian
conception
of
struggle
the
old
malthusian
leaven
reappeared
namely
in
darwin
remarks
as
to
the
alleged
inconveniences
of
maintaining
the
weak
in
mind
and
body
in
our
civilized
societies
ch
v
as
if
thousands
of
and
infirm
poets
scientists
inventors
and
reformers
together
with
other
thousands
of
fools
and
enthusiasts
were
not
the
most
precious
weapons
used
by
humanity
in
its
struggle
for
existence
by
intellectual
and
moral
arms
which
darwin
himself
emphasized
in
those
same
chapters
of
descent
of
man
it
happened
with
darwin
theory
as
it
always
happens
with
theories
having
any
bearing
upon
human
relations
instead
of
widening
it
according
to
his
own
hints
his
followers
narrowed
it
still
more
and
while
herbert
spencer
starting
on
independent
but
closely
allied
lines
attempted
to
widen
the
inquiry
into
that
great
question
who
are
the
fittest
especially
in
the
appendix
to
the
third
edition
of
the
data
of
ethics
the
numberless
followers
of
darwin
reduced
the
notion
of
struggle
for
existence
to
its
narrowest
limits
they
came
to
conceive
the
animal
world
as
a
world
of
perpetual
struggle
among
individuals
thirsting
for
one
another
blood
they
made
modern
literature
resound
with
the
of
woe
to
the
vanquished
as
if
it
were
the
last
word
of
modern
biology
they
raised
the
pitiless
struggle
for
personal
advantages
to
the
height
of
a
biological
principle
which
man
must
submit
to
as
well
under
the
menace
of
otherwise
succumbing
in
a
world
based
upon
mutual
extermination
leaving
aside
the
economists
who
know
of
natural
science
but
a
few
words
borrowed
from
vulgarizers
we
must
recognize
that
even
the
most
authorized
exponents
of
darwin
views
did
their
best
to
maintain
those
false
ideas
in
fact
if
we
take
huxley
who
certainly
is
considered
as
one
of
the
ablest
exponents
of
the
theory
of
evolution
were
we
not
taught
by
him
in
a
paper
on
the
for
existence
and
its
bearing
upon
man
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
moralist
the
animal
world
is
on
about
the
same
level
as
a
gladiators
show
the
creatures
are
fairly
well
treated
and
set
to
fight
hereby
the
strongest
the
swiftest
and
the
cunningest
live
to
fight
another
day
the
spectator
has
no
need
to
turn
his
thumb
down
as
no
quarter
is
given
or
further
down
in
the
same
article
did
he
not
tell
us
that
as
among
animals
so
among
primitive
men
the
weakest
and
stupidest
went
to
the
wall
while
the
toughest
and
shrewdest
those
who
were
best
fitted
to
cope
with
their
circumstances
but
not
the
best
in
another
way
survived
life
was
a
continuous
free
fight
and
beyond
the
limited
and
temporary
relations
of
the
family
the
hobbesian
war
of
each
against
all
was
the
normal
state
of
existence
in
how
far
this
view
of
nature
is
supported
by
fact
will
be
seen
from
the
evidence
which
will
be
here
submitted
to
the
reader
as
regards
the
animal
world
and
as
regards
primitive
man
but
it
may
be
remarked
at
once
that
huxley
view
of
nature
had
as
little
claim
to
be
taken
as
a
scientific
deduction
as
the
opposite
view
of
rousseau
who
saw
in
nature
but
love
peace
and
harmony
destroyed
by
the
accession
of
man
in
fact
the
first
walk
in
the
forest
the
first
observation
upon
any
animal
society
or
even
the
perusal
of
any
serious
work
dealing
with
animal
life
audubon
le
vaillant
no
matter
which
can
not
but
set
the
naturalist
thinking
about
the
part
taken
by
social
life
in
the
life
of
animals
and
prevent
him
from
seeing
in
nature
nothing
but
a
field
of
slaughter
just
as
this
would
prevent
him
from
seeing
in
nature
nothing
but
harmony
and
peace
rousseau
had
committed
the
error
of
excluding
the
fight
from
his
thoughts
and
huxley
committed
the
opposite
error
but
neither
rousseau
optimism
nor
huxley
pessimism
can
be
accepted
as
an
impartial
interpretation
of
nature
as
soon
as
we
study
animals
not
in
laboratories
and
museums
only
but
in
the
forest
and
the
prairie
in
the
steppe
and
the
mountains
we
at
once
perceive
that
though
there
is
an
immense
amount
of
warfare
and
extermination
going
on
amidst
various
species
and
especially
amidst
various
classes
of
animals
there
is
at
the
same
time
as
much
or
perhaps
even
more
of
mutual
support
mutual
aid
and
mutual
defence
amidst
animals
belonging
to
the
same
species
or
at
least
to
the
same
society
sociability
is
as
much
a
law
of
nature
as
mutual
struggle
of
course
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
to
estimate
however
roughly
the
relative
numerical
importance
of
both
these
series
of
facts
but
if
we
resort
to
an
indirect
test
and
ask
nature
who
are
the
fittest
those
who
are
continually
at
war
with
each
other
or
those
who
support
one
another
we
at
once
see
that
those
animals
which
acquire
habits
of
mutual
aid
are
undoubtedly
the
fittest
they
have
more
chances
to
survive
and
they
attain
in
their
respective
classes
the
highest
development
of
intelligence
and
bodily
organization
if
the
numberless
facts
which
can
be
brought
forward
to
support
this
view
are
taken
into
account
we
may
safely
say
that
mutual
aid
is
as
much
a
law
of
animal
life
as
mutual
struggle
but
that
as
a
factor
of
evolution
it
most
probably
has
a
far
greater
importance
inasmuch
as
it
favours
the
development
of
such
habits
and
characters
as
insure
the
maintenance
and
further
development
of
the
species
together
with
the
greatest
amount
of
welfare
and
enjoyment
of
life
for
the
individual
with
the
least
waste
of
energy
of
the
scientific
followers
of
darwin
the
first
as
far
as
i
know
who
understood
the
full
purport
of
mutual
aid
as
a
law
of
nature
and
the
chief
factor
of
evolution
was
a
russian
zoologist
the
late
dean
of
the
petersburg
university
professor
kessler
he
developed
his
ideas
in
an
address
which
he
delivered
in
january
a
few
months
before
his
death
at
a
congress
of
russian
naturalists
but
like
so
many
good
things
published
in
the
russian
tongue
only
that
remarkable
address
remains
almost
entirely
unknown
as
a
zoologist
of
old
standing
he
felt
bound
to
protest
against
the
abuse
of
a
term
the
struggle
for
existence
borrowed
from
zoology
or
at
least
against
overrating
its
importance
zoology
he
said
and
those
sciences
which
deal
with
man
continually
insist
upon
what
they
call
the
pitiless
law
of
struggle
for
existence
but
they
forget
the
existence
of
another
law
which
may
be
described
as
the
law
of
mutual
aid
which
law
at
least
for
the
animals
is
far
more
essential
than
the
former
he
pointed
out
how
the
need
of
leaving
progeny
necessarily
brings
animals
together
and
the
more
the
individuals
keep
together
the
more
they
mutually
support
each
other
and
the
more
are
the
chances
of
the
species
for
surviving
as
well
as
for
making
further
progress
in
its
intellectual
development
all
classes
of
animals
he
continued
and
especially
the
higher
ones
practise
mutual
aid
and
he
illustrated
his
idea
by
examples
borrowed
from
the
life
of
the
burying
beetles
and
the
social
life
of
birds
and
some
mammalia
the
examples
were
few
as
might
have
been
expected
in
a
short
opening
address
but
the
chief
points
were
clearly
stated
and
after
mentioning
that
in
the
evolution
of
mankind
mutual
aid
played
a
still
more
prominent
part
professor
kessler
concluded
as
follows
i
obviously
do
not
deny
the
struggle
for
existence
but
i
maintain
that
the
progressive
development
of
the
animal
kingdom
and
especially
of
mankind
is
favoured
much
more
by
mutual
support
than
by
mutual
struggle
all
organic
beings
have
two
essential
needs
that
of
nutrition
and
that
of
propagating
the
species
the
former
brings
them
to
a
struggle
and
to
mutual
extermination
while
the
needs
of
maintaining
the
species
bring
them
to
approach
one
another
and
to
support
one
another
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
in
the
evolution
of
the
organic
world
in
the
progressive
modification
of
organic
beings
mutual
support
among
individuals
plays
a
much
more
important
part
than
their
mutual
struggle
the
correctness
of
the
above
views
struck
most
of
the
russian
zoologists
present
and
syevertsoff
whose
work
is
well
known
to
ornithologists
and
geographers
supported
them
and
illustrated
them
by
a
few
more
examples
he
mentioned
sone
of
the
species
of
falcons
which
have
an
almost
ideal
organization
for
robbery
and
nevertheless
are
in
decay
while
other
species
of
falcons
which
practise
mutual
help
do
thrive
take
on
the
other
side
a
sociable
bird
the
duck
he
said
it
is
poorly
organized
on
the
whole
but
it
practises
mutual
support
and
it
almost
invades
the
earth
as
may
be
judged
from
its
numberless
varieties
and
species
the
readiness
of
the
russian
zoologists
to
accept
kessler
views
seems
quite
natural
because
nearly
all
of
them
have
had
opportunities
of
studying
the
animal
world
in
the
wide
uninhabited
regions
of
northern
asia
and
east
russia
and
it
is
impossible
to
study
like
regions
without
being
brought
to
the
same
ideas
i
recollect
myself
the
impression
produced
upon
me
by
the
animal
world
of
siberia
when
i
explored
the
vitim
regions
in
the
company
of
so
accomplished
a
zoologist
as
my
friend
polyakoff
was
we
both
were
under
the
fresh
impression
of
the
origin
of
species
but
we
vainly
looked
for
the
keen
competition
between
animals
of
the
same
species
which
the
reading
of
darwin
work
had
prepared
us
to
expect
even
after
taking
into
account
the
remarks
of
the
third
chapter
we
saw
plenty
of
adaptations
for
struggling
very
often
in
common
against
the
adverse
circumstances
of
climate
or
against
various
enemies
and
polyakoff
wrote
many
a
good
page
upon
the
mutual
dependency
of
carnivores
ruminants
and
rodents
in
their
geographical
distribution
we
witnessed
numbers
of
facts
of
mutual
support
especially
during
the
migrations
of
birds
and
ruminants
but
even
in
the
amur
and
usuri
regions
where
animal
life
swarms
in
abundance
facts
of
real
competition
and
struggle
between
higher
animals
of
the
same
species
came
very
seldom
under
my
notice
though
i
eagerly
searched
for
them
the
same
impression
appears
in
the
works
of
most
russian
zoologists
and
it
probably
explains
why
kessler
ideas
were
so
welcomed
by
the
russian
darwinists
whilst
like
ideas
are
not
in
vogue
amidst
the
followers
of
darwin
in
western
europe
the
first
thing
which
strikes
us
as
soon
as
we
begin
studying
the
struggle
for
existence
under
both
its
aspects
direct
and
metaphorical
is
the
abundance
of
facts
of
mutual
aid
not
only
for
rearing
progeny
as
recognized
by
most
evolutionists
but
also
for
the
safety
of
the
individual
and
for
providing
it
with
the
necessary
food
with
many
large
divisions
of
the
animal
kingdom
mutual
aid
is
the
rule
mutual
aid
is
met
with
even
amidst
the
lowest
animals
and
we
must
be
prepared
to
learn
some
day
from
the
students
of
microscopical
facts
of
unconscious
mutual
support
even
from
the
life
of
of
course
our
knowledge
of
the
life
of
the
invertebrates
save
the
termites
the
ants
and
the
bees
is
extremely
limited
and
yet
even
as
regards
the
lower
animals
we
may
glean
a
few
facts
of
cooperation
the
numberless
associations
of
locusts
vanessae
cicindelae
cicadae
and
so
on
are
practically
quite
unexplored
but
the
very
fact
of
their
existence
indicates
that
they
must
be
composed
on
about
the
same
principles
as
the
temporary
associations
of
ants
or
bees
for
purposes
of
migration
as
to
the
beetles
we
have
quite
facts
of
mutual
help
amidst
the
burying
beetles
necrophorus
they
must
have
some
decaying
organic
matter
to
lay
their
eggs
in
and
thus
to
provide
their
larvae
with
food
but
that
matter
must
not
decay
very
rapidly
so
they
are
wont
to
bury
in
the
ground
the
corpses
of
all
kinds
of
small
animals
which
they
occasionally
find
in
their
rambles
as
a
rule
they
live
an
isolated
life
but
when
one
of
them
has
discovered
the
corpse
of
a
mouse
or
of
a
bird
which
it
hardly
could
manage
to
bury
itself
it
calls
four
six
or
ten
other
beetles
to
perform
the
operation
with
united
efforts
if
necessary
they
transport
the
corpse
to
a
suitable
soft
ground
and
they
bury
it
in
a
very
considerate
way
without
quarrelling
as
to
which
of
them
will
enjoy
the
privilege
of
laying
its
eggs
in
the
buried
corpse
and
when
gleditsch
attached
a
dead
bird
to
a
cross
made
out
of
two
sticks
or
suspended
a
toad
to
a
stick
planted
in
the
soil
the
little
beetles
would
in
the
same
friendly
way
combine
their
intelligences
to
overcome
the
artifice
of
man
the
same
combination
of
efforts
has
been
noticed
among
the
even
among
animals
standing
at
a
somewhat
lower
stage
of
organization
we
may
find
like
examples
some
of
the
west
indies
and
north
america
combine
in
large
swarms
in
order
to
travel
to
the
sea
and
to
deposit
therein
their
spawn
and
each
such
migration
implies
concert
and
mutual
support
as
to
the
big
molucca
crab
limulus
i
was
struck
in
at
the
brighton
aquarium
with
the
extent
of
mutual
assistance
which
these
clumsy
animals
are
capable
of
bestowing
upon
a
comrade
in
case
of
need
one
of
them
had
fallen
upon
its
back
in
a
corner
of
the
tank
and
its
heavy
carapace
prevented
it
from
returning
to
its
natural
position
the
more
so
as
there
was
in
the
corner
an
iron
bar
which
rendered
the
task
still
more
difficult
its
comrades
came
to
the
rescue
and
for
one
hour
time
i
watched
how
they
endeavoured
to
help
their
they
came
two
at
once
pushed
their
friend
from
beneath
and
after
strenuous
efforts
succeeded
in
lifting
it
upright
but
then
the
iron
bar
would
prevent
them
from
achieving
the
work
of
rescue
and
the
crab
would
again
heavily
fall
upon
its
back
after
many
attempts
one
of
the
helpers
would
go
in
the
depth
of
the
tank
and
bring
two
other
crabs
which
would
begin
with
fresh
forces
the
same
pushing
and
lifting
of
their
helpless
comrade
we
stayed
in
the
aquarium
for
more
than
two
hours
and
when
leaving
we
again
came
to
cast
a
glance
upon
the
tank
the
work
of
rescue
still
continued
since
i
saw
that
i
can
not
refuse
credit
to
the
observation
quoted
by
erasmus
darwin
namely
that
the
common
crab
during
the
moulting
season
stations
as
sentinel
an
unmoulted
or
individual
to
prevent
marine
enemies
from
injuring
moulted
individuals
in
their
unprotected
state
facts
illustrating
mutual
aid
amidst
the
termites
the
ants
and
the
bees
are
so
well
known
to
the
general
reader
especially
through
the
works
of
romanes
buchner
and
sir
john
lubbock
that
i
may
limit
my
remarks
to
a
very
few
hints
if
we
take
an
ants
nest
we
not
only
see
that
every
description
of
of
progeny
foraging
building
rearing
of
aphides
and
so
on
is
performed
according
to
the
principles
of
voluntary
mutual
aid
we
must
also
recognize
with
forel
that
the
chief
the
fundamental
feature
of
the
life
of
many
species
of
ants
is
the
fact
and
the
obligation
for
every
ant
of
sharing
its
food
already
swallowed
and
partly
digested
with
every
member
of
the
community
which
may
apply
for
it
two
ants
belonging
to
two
different
species
or
to
two
hostile
nests
when
they
occasionally
meet
together
will
avoid
each
other
but
two
ants
belonging
to
the
same
nest
or
to
the
same
colony
of
nests
will
approach
each
other
exchange
a
few
movements
with
the
antennae
and
if
one
of
them
is
hungry
or
thirsty
and
especially
if
the
other
has
its
crop
full
it
immediately
asks
for
food
the
individual
thus
requested
never
refuses
it
sets
apart
its
mandibles
takes
a
proper
position
and
regurgitates
a
drop
of
transparent
fluid
which
is
licked
up
by
the
hungry
ant
regurgitating
food
for
other
ants
is
so
prominent
a
feature
in
the
life
of
ants
at
liberty
and
it
so
constantly
recurs
both
for
feeding
hungry
comrades
and
for
feeding
larvae
that
forel
considers
the
digestive
tube
of
the
ants
as
consisting
of
two
different
parts
one
of
which
the
posterior
is
for
the
special
use
of
the
individual
and
the
other
the
anterior
part
is
chiefly
for
the
use
of
the
community
if
an
ant
which
has
its
crop
full
has
been
selfish
enough
to
refuse
feeding
a
comrade
it
will
be
treated
as
an
enemy
or
even
worse
if
the
refusal
has
been
made
while
its
kinsfolk
were
fighting
with
some
other
species
they
will
fall
back
upon
the
greedy
individual
with
greater
vehemence
than
even
upon
the
enemies
themselves
and
if
an
ant
has
not
refused
to
feed
another
ant
belonging
to
an
enemy
species
it
will
be
treated
by
the
kinsfolk
of
the
latter
as
a
friend
all
this
is
confirmed
by
most
accurate
observation
and
decisive
experiments
in
that
immense
division
of
the
animal
kingdom
which
embodies
more
than
one
thousand
species
and
is
so
numerous
that
the
brazilians
pretend
that
brazil
belongs
to
the
ants
not
to
men
competition
amidst
the
members
of
the
same
nest
or
the
colony
of
nests
does
not
exist
however
terrible
the
wars
between
different
species
and
whatever
the
atrocities
committed
at
mutual
aid
within
the
community
grown
into
a
habit
and
very
often
for
the
common
welfare
are
the
rule
the
ants
and
termites
have
renounced
the
hobbesian
war
and
they
are
the
better
for
it
their
wonderful
nests
their
buildings
superior
in
relative
size
to
those
of
man
their
paved
roads
and
overground
vaulted
galleries
their
spacious
halls
and
granaries
their
harvesting
and
malting
of
grain
their
rational
methods
of
nursing
their
eggs
and
larvae
and
of
building
special
nests
for
rearing
the
aphides
whom
linnaeus
so
picturesquely
described
as
the
cows
of
the
ants
and
finally
their
courage
pluck
and
superior
intelligence
all
these
are
the
natural
outcome
of
the
mutual
aid
which
they
practise
at
every
stage
of
their
busy
and
laborious
lives
that
mode
of
life
also
necessarily
resulted
in
the
development
of
another
essential
feature
of
the
life
of
ants
the
immense
development
of
individual
initiative
which
in
its
turn
evidently
led
to
the
development
of
that
high
and
varied
intelligence
which
can
not
but
strike
the
human
observer
if
we
knew
no
other
facts
from
animal
life
than
what
we
know
about
the
ants
and
the
termites
we
already
might
safely
conclude
that
mutual
aid
which
leads
to
mutual
confidence
the
first
condition
for
courage
and
individual
initiative
the
first
condition
for
intellectual
progress
are
two
factors
infinitely
more
important
than
mutual
struggle
in
the
evolution
of
the
animal
kingdom
in
fact
the
ant
thrives
without
having
any
of
the
protective
features
which
can
not
be
dispensed
with
by
animals
living
an
isolated
life
its
colour
renders
it
conspicuous
to
its
enemies
and
the
lofty
nests
of
many
species
are
conspicuous
in
the
meadows
and
forests
it
is
not
protected
by
a
hard
carapace
and
its
stinging
apparatus
however
dangerous
when
hundreds
of
stings
are
plunged
into
the
flesh
of
an
animal
is
not
of
a
great
value
for
individual
defence
while
the
eggs
and
larvae
of
the
ants
are
a
dainty
for
a
great
number
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
forests
and
yet
the
ants
in
their
thousands
are
not
much
destroyed
by
the
birds
not
even
by
the
and
they
are
dreaded
by
most
stronger
insects
when
forel
emptied
a
bagful
of
ants
in
a
meadow
he
saw
that
the
crickets
ran
away
abandoning
their
holes
to
be
sacked
by
the
ants
the
grasshoppers
and
the
crickets
fled
in
all
directions
the
spiders
and
the
beetles
abandoned
their
prey
in
order
not
to
become
prey
themselves
even
the
nests
of
the
wasps
were
taken
by
the
ants
after
a
battle
during
which
many
ants
perished
for
the
safety
of
the
commonwealth
even
the
swiftest
insects
can
not
escape
and
forel
often
saw
butterflies
gnats
flies
and
so
on
surprised
and
killed
by
the
ants
their
force
is
in
mutual
support
and
mutual
confidence
and
if
the
ant
apart
from
the
still
higher
developed
termites
stands
at
the
very
top
of
the
whole
class
of
insects
for
its
intellectual
capacities
if
its
courage
is
only
equalled
by
the
most
courageous
vertebrates
and
if
its
brain
to
use
words
is
one
of
the
most
marvellous
atoms
of
matter
in
the
world
perhaps
more
so
than
the
brain
of
man
is
it
not
due
to
the
fact
that
mutual
aid
has
entirely
taken
the
place
of
mutual
struggle
in
the
communities
of
ants
the
same
is
true
as
regards
the
bees
these
small
insects
which
so
easily
might
become
the
prey
of
so
many
birds
and
whose
honey
has
so
many
admirers
in
all
classes
of
animals
from
the
beetle
to
the
bear
also
have
none
of
the
protective
features
derived
from
mimicry
or
otherwise
without
which
an
isolatedly
living
insect
hardly
could
escape
wholesale
destruction
and
yet
owing
to
the
mutual
aid
they
practise
they
obtain
the
wide
extension
which
we
know
and
the
intelligence
we
admire
by
working
in
common
they
multiply
their
individual
forces
by
resorting
to
a
temporary
division
of
labour
combined
with
the
capacity
of
each
bee
to
perform
every
kind
of
work
when
required
they
attain
such
a
degree
of
and
safety
as
no
isolated
animal
can
ever
expect
to
achieve
however
strong
or
well
armed
it
may
be
in
their
combinations
they
are
often
more
successful
than
man
when
he
neglects
to
take
advantage
of
a
mutual
assistance
thus
when
a
new
swarm
of
bees
is
going
to
leave
the
hive
in
search
of
a
new
abode
a
number
of
bees
will
make
a
preliminary
exploration
of
the
neighbourhood
and
if
they
discover
a
convenient
say
an
old
basket
or
anything
of
the
kind
they
will
take
possession
of
it
clean
it
and
guard
it
sometimes
for
a
whole
week
till
the
swarm
comes
to
settle
therein
but
how
many
human
settlers
will
perish
in
new
countries
simply
for
not
having
understood
the
necessity
of
combining
their
efforts
by
combining
their
individual
intelligences
they
succeed
in
coping
with
adverse
circumstances
even
quite
unforeseen
and
unusual
like
those
bees
of
the
paris
exhibition
which
fastened
with
their
resinous
propolis
the
shutter
to
a
fitted
in
the
wall
of
their
hive
besides
they
display
none
of
the
sanguinary
proclivities
and
love
of
useless
fighting
with
which
many
writers
so
readily
endow
animals
the
sentries
which
guard
the
entrance
to
the
hive
pitilessly
put
to
death
the
robbing
bees
which
attempt
entering
the
hive
but
those
stranger
bees
which
come
to
the
hive
by
mistake
are
left
unmolested
especially
if
they
come
laden
with
pollen
or
are
young
individuals
which
can
easily
go
astray
there
is
no
more
warfare
than
is
strictly
required
the
sociability
of
the
bees
is
the
more
instructive
as
predatory
instincts
and
laziness
continue
to
exist
among
the
bees
as
well
and
reappear
each
time
that
their
growth
is
favoured
by
some
circumstances
it
is
well
known
that
there
always
are
a
number
of
bees
which
prefer
a
life
of
robbery
to
the
laborious
life
of
a
worker
and
that
both
periods
of
scarcity
and
periods
of
an
unusually
rich
supply
of
food
lead
to
an
increase
of
the
robbing
class
when
our
crops
are
in
and
there
remains
but
little
to
gather
in
our
meadows
and
fields
robbing
bees
become
of
more
frequent
occurrence
while
on
the
other
side
about
the
sugar
plantations
of
the
west
indies
and
the
sugar
refineries
of
europe
robbery
laziness
and
very
often
drunkenness
become
quite
usual
with
the
bees
we
thus
see
that
instincts
continue
to
exist
amidst
the
bees
as
well
but
natural
selection
continually
must
eliminate
them
because
in
the
long
run
the
practice
of
solidarity
proves
much
more
advantageous
to
the
species
than
the
development
of
individuals
endowed
with
predatory
inclinations
the
cunningest
and
the
shrewdest
are
eliminated
in
favour
of
those
who
understand
the
advantages
of
sociable
life
and
mutual
support
certainly
neither
the
ants
nor
the
bees
nor
even
the
termites
have
risen
to
the
conception
of
a
higher
solidarity
embodying
the
whole
of
the
species
in
that
respect
they
evidently
have
not
attained
a
degree
of
development
which
we
do
not
find
even
among
our
political
scientific
and
religious
leaders
their
social
instincts
hardly
extend
beyond
the
limits
of
the
hive
or
the
nest
however
colonies
of
no
less
than
two
hundred
nests
belonging
to
two
different
species
formica
exsecta
and
pressilabris
have
been
described
by
forel
on
mount
tendre
and
mount
saleve
and
forel
maintains
that
each
member
of
these
colonies
recognizes
every
other
member
of
the
colony
and
that
they
all
take
part
in
common
defence
while
in
pennsylvania
maccook
saw
a
whole
nation
of
from
to
nests
of
the
ant
all
living
in
perfect
intelligence
and
bates
has
described
the
hillocks
of
the
termites
covering
large
surfaces
in
the
campos
some
of
the
nests
being
the
refuge
of
two
or
three
different
species
and
most
of
them
being
connected
by
vaulted
galleries
or
arcades
some
steps
towards
the
amalgamation
of
larger
divisions
of
the
species
for
purposes
of
mutual
protection
are
thus
met
with
even
among
the
invertebrate
animals
going
now
over
to
higher
animals
we
find
far
more
instances
of
undoubtedly
conscious
mutual
help
for
all
possible
purposes
though
we
must
recognize
at
once
that
our
knowledge
even
of
the
life
of
higher
animals
still
remains
very
imperfect
a
large
number
of
facts
have
been
accumulated
by
observers
but
there
are
whole
divisions
of
the
animal
kingdom
of
which
we
know
almost
nothing
trustworthy
information
as
regards
fishes
is
extremely
scarce
partly
owing
to
the
difficulties
of
observation
and
partly
because
no
proper
attention
has
yet
been
paid
to
the
subject
as
to
the
mammalia
kessler
already
remarked
how
little
we
know
about
their
manners
of
life
many
of
them
are
nocturnal
in
their
habits
others
conceal
themselves
underground
and
those
ruminants
whose
social
life
and
migrations
offer
the
greatest
interest
do
not
let
man
approach
their
herds
it
is
chiefly
upon
birds
that
we
have
the
widest
range
of
information
and
yet
the
social
life
of
very
many
species
remains
but
imperfectly
known
still
we
need
not
complain
about
the
lack
of
facts
as
will
be
seen
from
the
following
i
need
not
dwell
upon
the
associations
of
male
and
female
for
rearing
their
offspring
for
providing
it
with
food
during
their
first
steps
in
life
or
for
hunting
in
common
though
it
may
be
mentioned
by
the
way
that
such
associations
are
the
rule
even
with
the
least
sociable
carnivores
and
rapacious
birds
and
that
they
derive
a
special
interest
from
being
the
field
upon
which
tenderer
feelings
develop
even
amidst
otherwise
most
cruel
animals
it
may
also
be
added
that
the
rarity
of
associations
larger
than
that
of
the
family
among
the
carnivores
and
the
birds
of
prey
though
mostly
being
the
result
of
their
very
modes
of
feeding
can
also
be
explained
to
some
extent
as
a
consequence
of
the
change
produced
in
the
animal
world
by
the
rapid
increase
of
mankind
at
any
rate
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
there
are
species
living
a
quite
isolated
life
in
regions
while
the
same
species
or
their
nearest
congeners
are
gregarious
in
uninhabited
countries
wolves
foxes
and
several
birds
of
prey
may
be
quoted
as
instances
in
point
however
associations
which
do
not
extend
beyond
the
family
bonds
are
of
relatively
small
importance
in
our
case
the
more
so
as
we
know
numbers
of
associations
for
more
general
purposes
such
as
hunting
mutual
protection
and
even
simple
enjoyment
of
life
audubon
already
mentioned
that
eagles
occasionally
associate
for
hunting
and
his
description
of
the
two
bald
eagles
male
and
female
hunting
on
the
mississippi
is
well
known
for
its
graphic
powers
but
one
of
the
most
conclusive
observations
of
the
kind
belongs
to
syevertsoff
whilst
studying
the
fauna
of
the
russian
steppes
he
once
saw
an
eagle
belonging
to
an
altogether
gregarious
species
the
eagle
haliactos
albicilla
rising
high
in
the
air
for
half
an
hour
it
was
describing
its
wide
circles
in
silence
when
at
once
its
piercing
voice
was
heard
its
cry
was
soon
answered
by
another
eagle
which
approached
it
and
was
followed
by
a
third
a
fourth
and
so
on
till
nine
or
ten
eagles
came
together
and
soon
disappeared
in
the
afternoon
syevertsoff
went
to
the
place
whereto
he
saw
the
eagles
flying
concealed
by
one
of
the
undulations
of
the
steppe
he
approached
them
and
discovered
that
they
had
gathered
around
the
corpse
of
a
horse
the
old
ones
which
as
a
rule
begin
the
meal
first
such
are
their
rules
of
were
sitting
upon
the
haystacks
of
the
neighbourhood
and
kept
watch
while
the
younger
ones
were
continuing
the
meal
surrounded
by
bands
of
crows
from
this
and
like
observations
syevertsoff
concluded
that
the
eagles
combine
for
hunting
when
they
all
have
risen
to
a
great
height
they
are
enabled
if
they
are
ten
to
survey
an
area
of
at
least
miles
square
and
as
soon
as
any
one
has
discovered
something
he
warns
the
others
of
course
it
might
be
argued
that
a
simple
instinctive
cry
of
the
first
eagle
or
even
its
movements
would
have
had
the
same
effect
of
bringing
several
eagles
to
the
prey
but
in
this
case
there
is
strong
evidence
in
favour
of
mutual
warning
because
the
ten
eagles
came
together
before
descending
towards
the
prey
and
syevertsoff
had
later
on
several
opportunities
of
ascertaining
that
the
whitetailed
eagles
always
assemble
for
devouring
a
corpse
and
that
some
of
them
the
younger
ones
first
always
keep
watch
while
the
others
are
eating
in
fact
the
eagle
one
of
the
bravest
and
best
hunters
is
a
gregarious
bird
altogether
and
brehm
says
that
when
kept
in
captivity
it
very
soon
contracts
an
attachment
to
its
keepers
sociability
is
a
common
feature
with
very
many
other
birds
of
prey
the
brazilian
kite
one
of
the
most
impudent
robbers
is
nevertheless
a
most
sociable
bird
its
hunting
associations
have
been
described
by
darwin
and
other
naturalists
and
it
is
a
fact
that
when
it
has
seized
upon
a
prey
which
is
too
big
it
calls
together
five
or
six
friends
to
carry
it
away
after
a
busy
day
when
these
kites
retire
for
their
to
a
tree
or
to
the
bushes
they
always
gather
in
bands
sometimes
coming
together
from
distances
of
ten
or
more
miles
and
they
often
are
joined
by
several
other
vultures
especially
the
percnopters
their
true
friends
says
in
another
continent
in
the
transcaspian
deserts
they
have
according
to
zarudnyi
the
same
habit
of
nesting
together
the
sociable
vulture
one
of
the
strongest
vultures
has
received
its
very
name
from
its
love
of
society
they
live
in
numerous
bands
and
decidedly
enjoy
society
numbers
of
them
join
in
their
high
flights
for
sport
they
live
in
very
good
friendship
le
vaillant
says
and
in
the
same
cave
i
sometimes
found
as
many
as
three
nests
close
together
the
urubu
vultures
of
brazil
are
as
or
perhaps
even
more
sociable
than
rooks
the
little
egyptian
vultures
live
in
close
friendship
they
play
in
bands
in
the
air
they
come
together
to
spend
the
night
and
in
the
morning
they
all
go
together
to
search
for
their
food
and
never
does
the
slightest
quarrel
arise
among
them
such
is
the
testimony
of
brehm
who
had
plenty
of
opportunities
of
observing
their
life
the
falcon
is
also
met
with
in
numerous
bands
in
the
forests
of
brazil
and
the
kestrel
tinnunculus
cenchris
when
it
has
left
europe
and
has
reached
in
the
winter
the
prairies
and
forests
of
asia
gathers
in
numerous
societies
in
the
steppes
of
south
russia
it
is
or
rather
was
so
sociable
that
nordmann
saw
them
in
numerous
bands
with
other
falcons
falco
tinnunculus
oesulon
and
subbuteo
coming
together
every
fine
afternoon
about
four
and
enjoying
their
sports
till
late
in
the
night
they
set
off
flying
all
at
once
in
a
quite
straight
line
towards
some
determined
point
and
having
reached
it
immediately
returned
over
the
same
line
to
repeat
the
same
flight
to
take
flights
in
flocks
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
the
flight
is
quite
common
among
all
sorts
of
birds
in
the
humber
district
especially
ch
dixon
writes
vast
flights
of
dunlins
often
appear
upon
the
towards
the
end
of
august
and
remain
for
the
winter
the
movements
of
these
birds
are
most
interesting
as
a
vast
flock
wheels
and
spreads
out
or
closes
up
with
as
much
precision
as
drilled
troops
scattered
among
them
are
many
odd
stints
and
sanderlings
and
it
would
be
quite
impossible
to
enumerate
here
the
various
hunting
associations
of
birds
but
the
fishing
associations
of
the
pelicans
are
certainly
worthy
of
notice
for
the
remarkable
order
and
intelligence
displayed
by
these
clumsy
birds
they
always
go
fishing
in
numerous
bands
and
after
having
chosen
an
appropriate
bay
they
form
a
wide
in
face
of
the
shore
and
narrow
it
by
paddling
towards
the
shore
catching
all
fish
that
happen
to
be
enclosed
in
the
circle
on
narrow
rivers
and
canals
they
even
divide
into
two
parties
each
of
which
draws
up
on
a
and
both
paddle
to
meet
each
other
just
as
if
two
parties
of
men
dragging
two
long
nets
should
advance
to
capture
all
fish
taken
between
the
nets
when
both
parties
come
to
meet
as
the
night
comes
they
fly
to
their
always
the
same
for
each
flock
and
no
one
has
ever
seen
them
fighting
for
the
possession
of
either
the
bay
or
the
resting
place
in
south
america
they
gather
in
flocks
of
from
forty
to
fifty
thousand
individuals
part
of
which
enjoy
sleep
while
the
others
keep
watch
and
others
again
go
fishing
and
finally
i
should
be
doing
an
injustice
to
the
if
i
did
not
mention
how
faithfully
each
of
them
shares
any
food
it
discovers
with
all
members
of
the
society
to
which
it
belongs
the
fact
was
known
to
the
greeks
and
it
has
been
transmitted
to
posterity
how
a
greek
orator
once
exclaimed
i
quote
from
memory
while
i
am
speaking
to
you
a
sparrow
has
come
to
tell
to
other
sparrows
that
a
slave
has
dropped
on
the
floor
a
sack
of
corn
and
they
all
go
there
to
feed
upon
the
grain
the
more
one
is
pleased
to
find
this
observation
of
old
confirmed
in
a
recent
little
book
by
gurney
who
does
not
doubt
that
the
house
sparrows
always
inform
each
other
as
to
where
there
is
some
food
to
steal
he
says
when
a
stack
has
been
thrashed
ever
so
far
from
the
yard
the
sparrows
in
the
yard
have
always
had
their
crops
full
of
the
grain
true
the
sparrows
are
extremely
particular
in
keeping
their
domains
free
from
the
invasions
of
strangers
thus
the
sparrows
of
the
jardin
du
luxembourg
bitterly
fight
all
other
sparrows
which
may
attempt
to
enjoy
their
turn
of
the
garden
and
its
visitors
but
within
their
own
communities
they
fully
practise
mutual
support
though
occasionally
there
will
be
of
course
some
quarrelling
even
amongst
the
best
friends
hunting
and
feeding
in
common
is
so
much
the
habit
in
the
feathered
world
that
more
quotations
hardly
would
be
needful
it
must
be
considered
as
an
established
fact
as
to
the
force
derived
from
such
associations
it
is
the
strongest
birds
of
prey
are
powerless
in
face
of
the
associations
of
our
smallest
bird
pets
even
eagles
even
the
powerful
and
terrible
booted
eagle
and
the
martial
eagle
which
is
strong
enough
to
carry
away
a
hare
or
a
young
antelope
in
its
claws
are
compelled
to
abandon
their
prey
to
bands
of
those
beggars
the
kites
which
give
the
eagle
a
regular
chase
as
soon
as
they
see
it
in
possession
of
a
good
prey
the
kites
will
also
give
chase
to
the
swift
and
rob
it
of
the
fish
it
has
captured
but
no
one
ever
saw
the
kites
fighting
together
for
the
possession
of
the
prey
so
stolen
on
the
kerguelen
island
coues
saw
the
gulls
to
buphogus
the
of
the
sealers
pursue
make
them
disgorge
their
food
while
on
the
other
side
the
gulls
and
the
terns
combined
to
drive
away
the
as
soon
as
it
came
near
to
their
abodes
especially
at
the
little
but
extremely
swift
lapwings
vanellus
cristatus
boldly
attack
the
birds
of
prey
to
see
them
attacking
a
buzzard
a
kite
a
crow
or
an
eagle
is
one
of
the
most
amusing
spectacles
one
feels
that
they
are
sure
of
victory
and
one
sees
the
anger
of
the
bird
of
prey
in
such
circumstances
they
perfectly
support
one
another
and
their
courage
grows
with
their
numbers
the
lapwing
has
well
merited
the
name
of
a
good
mother
which
the
greeks
gave
to
it
for
it
never
fails
to
protect
other
aquatic
birds
from
the
attacks
of
their
enemies
but
even
the
little
white
wagtails
motacilla
alba
whom
we
well
know
in
our
gardens
and
whose
whole
length
hardly
attains
eight
inches
compel
the
to
abandon
its
hunt
i
often
admired
their
courage
and
agility
the
old
brehm
wrote
and
i
am
persuaded
that
the
falcon
alone
is
capable
of
capturing
any
of
them
when
a
band
of
wagtails
has
compelled
a
bird
of
prey
to
retreat
they
make
the
air
resound
with
their
triumphant
cries
and
after
that
they
separate
they
thus
come
together
for
the
special
purpose
of
giving
chase
to
their
enemy
just
as
we
see
it
when
the
whole
of
a
forest
has
been
raised
by
the
news
that
a
nocturnal
bird
has
made
its
appearance
during
the
day
and
all
together
birds
of
prey
and
small
inoffensive
singers
set
to
chase
the
stranger
and
make
it
return
to
its
concealment
what
an
immense
difference
between
the
force
of
a
kite
a
buzzard
or
a
hawk
and
such
small
birds
as
the
and
yet
these
little
birds
by
their
common
action
and
courage
prove
superior
to
the
and
armed
robbers
in
europe
the
wagtails
not
only
chase
the
birds
of
prey
which
might
be
dangerous
to
them
but
they
chase
also
the
rather
for
fun
than
for
doing
it
any
harm
while
in
india
according
to
jerdon
testimony
the
jackdaws
chase
the
for
simple
matter
of
amusement
prince
wied
saw
the
brazilian
eagle
urubitinga
surrounded
by
numberless
flocks
of
toucans
and
cassiques
a
bird
nearly
akin
to
our
rook
which
mocked
it
the
eagle
he
adds
usually
supports
these
insults
very
quietly
but
from
time
to
time
it
will
catch
one
of
these
mockers
in
all
such
cases
the
little
birds
though
very
much
inferior
in
force
to
the
bird
of
prey
prove
superior
to
it
by
their
common
action
however
the
most
striking
effects
of
common
life
for
the
security
of
the
individual
for
its
enjoyment
of
life
and
for
the
development
of
its
intellectual
capacities
are
seen
in
two
great
families
of
birds
the
cranes
and
the
parrots
the
cranes
are
extremely
sociable
and
live
in
most
excellent
relations
not
only
with
their
congeners
but
also
with
most
aquatic
birds
their
prudence
is
really
astonishing
so
also
their
intelligence
they
grasp
the
new
conditions
in
a
moment
and
act
accordingly
their
sentries
always
keep
watch
around
a
flock
which
is
feeding
or
resting
and
the
hunters
know
well
how
difficult
it
is
to
approach
them
if
man
has
succeeded
in
surprising
them
they
will
never
return
to
the
same
place
without
having
sent
out
one
single
scout
first
and
a
party
of
scouts
afterwards
and
when
the
reconnoitring
party
returns
and
reports
that
there
is
no
danger
a
second
group
of
scouts
is
sent
out
to
verify
the
first
report
before
the
whole
band
moves
with
kindred
species
the
cranes
contract
real
friendship
and
in
captivity
there
is
no
bird
save
the
also
sociable
and
highly
intelligent
parrot
which
enters
into
such
real
friendship
with
man
it
sees
in
man
not
a
master
but
a
friend
and
endeavours
to
manifest
it
brehm
concludes
from
a
wide
personal
experience
the
crane
is
in
continual
activity
from
early
in
the
morning
till
late
in
the
night
but
it
gives
a
few
hours
only
in
the
morning
to
the
task
of
searching
its
food
chiefly
vegetable
all
the
remainder
of
the
day
is
given
to
society
life
it
picks
up
small
pieces
of
wood
or
small
stones
throws
them
in
the
air
and
tries
to
catch
them
it
bends
its
neck
opens
its
wings
dances
jumps
runs
about
and
tries
to
manifest
by
all
means
its
good
disposition
of
mind
and
always
it
remains
graceful
and
beautiful
as
it
lives
in
society
it
has
almost
no
enemies
and
though
brehm
occasionally
saw
one
of
them
captured
by
a
crocodile
he
wrote
that
except
the
crocodile
he
knew
no
enemies
of
the
crane
it
eschews
all
of
them
by
its
proverbial
prudence
and
it
attains
as
a
rule
a
very
old
age
no
wonder
that
for
the
maintenance
of
the
species
the
crane
need
not
rear
a
numerous
offspring
it
usually
hatches
but
two
eggs
as
to
its
superior
intelligence
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
all
observers
are
unanimous
in
recognizing
that
its
intellectual
capacities
remind
one
very
much
of
those
of
man
the
other
extremely
sociable
bird
the
parrot
stands
as
known
at
the
very
top
of
the
whole
feathered
world
for
the
development
of
its
intelligence
brehm
has
so
admirably
summed
up
the
manners
of
life
of
the
parrot
that
i
can
not
do
better
than
translate
the
following
sentence
except
in
the
pairing
season
they
live
in
very
numerous
societies
or
bands
they
choose
a
place
in
the
forest
to
stay
there
and
thence
they
start
every
morning
for
their
hunting
expeditions
the
members
of
each
band
remain
faithfully
attached
to
each
other
and
they
share
in
common
good
or
bad
luck
all
together
they
repair
in
the
morning
to
a
field
or
to
a
garden
or
to
a
tree
to
feed
upon
fruits
they
post
sentries
to
keep
watch
over
the
safety
of
the
whole
band
and
are
attentive
to
their
warnings
in
case
of
danger
all
take
to
flight
mutually
supporting
each
other
and
all
simultaneously
return
to
their
in
a
word
they
always
live
closely
united
they
enjoy
society
of
other
birds
as
well
in
india
the
jays
and
crows
come
together
from
many
miles
round
to
spend
the
night
in
company
with
the
parrots
in
the
bamboo
thickets
when
the
parrots
start
hunting
they
display
the
most
wonderful
intelligence
prudence
and
capacity
of
coping
with
circumstances
take
for
instance
a
band
of
white
cacadoos
in
australia
before
starting
to
plunder
a
they
first
send
out
a
reconnoitring
party
which
occupies
the
highest
trees
in
the
vicinity
of
the
field
while
other
scouts
perch
upon
the
intermediate
trees
between
the
field
and
the
forest
and
transmit
the
signals
if
the
report
runs
all
right
a
score
of
cacadoos
will
separate
from
the
bulk
of
the
band
take
a
flight
in
the
air
and
then
fly
towards
the
trees
nearest
to
the
field
they
also
will
scrutinize
the
neighbourhood
for
a
long
while
and
only
then
will
they
give
the
signal
for
general
advance
after
which
the
whole
band
starts
at
once
and
plunders
the
field
in
no
time
the
australian
settlers
have
the
greatest
difficulties
in
beguiling
the
prudence
of
the
parrots
but
if
man
with
all
his
art
and
weapons
has
succeeded
in
killing
some
of
them
the
cacadoos
become
so
prudent
and
watchful
that
they
henceforward
baffle
all
stratagems
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
is
the
practice
of
life
in
society
which
enables
the
parrots
to
attain
that
very
high
level
of
almost
human
intelligence
and
almost
human
feelings
which
we
know
in
them
their
high
intelligence
has
induced
the
best
naturalists
to
describe
some
species
namely
the
grey
parrot
as
the
birdman
as
to
their
mutual
attachment
it
is
known
that
when
a
parrot
has
been
killed
by
a
hunter
the
others
fly
over
the
corpse
of
their
comrade
with
shrieks
of
complaints
and
themselves
fall
the
victims
of
their
friendship
as
audubon
said
and
when
two
captive
parrots
though
belonging
to
two
different
species
have
contracted
mutual
friendship
the
accidental
death
of
one
of
the
two
friends
has
sometimes
been
followed
by
the
death
from
grief
and
sorrow
of
the
other
friend
it
is
no
less
evident
that
in
their
societies
they
find
infinitely
more
protection
than
they
possibly
might
find
in
any
ideal
development
of
beak
and
claw
very
few
birds
of
prey
or
mammals
dare
attack
any
but
the
smaller
species
of
parrots
and
brehm
is
absolutely
right
in
saying
of
the
parrots
as
he
also
says
of
the
cranes
and
the
sociable
monkeys
that
they
hardly
have
any
enemies
besides
men
and
he
adds
it
is
most
probable
that
the
larger
parrots
succumb
chiefly
to
old
age
rather
than
die
from
the
claws
of
any
enemies
only
man
owing
to
his
still
more
superior
intelligence
and
weapons
also
derived
from
association
succeeds
in
partially
destroying
them
their
very
longevity
would
thus
appear
as
a
result
of
their
social
life
could
we
not
say
the
same
as
regards
their
wonderful
memory
which
also
must
be
favoured
in
its
development
by
society
life
and
by
longevity
accompanied
by
a
full
enjoyment
of
bodily
and
mental
faculties
till
a
very
old
age
as
seen
from
the
above
the
war
of
each
against
all
is
not
the
law
of
nature
mutual
aid
is
as
much
a
law
of
nature
as
mutual
struggle
and
that
law
will
become
still
more
apparent
when
we
have
analyzed
some
other
associations
of
birds
and
those
of
the
mammalia
a
few
hints
as
to
the
importance
of
the
law
of
mutual
aid
for
the
evolution
of
the
animal
kingdom
have
already
been
given
in
the
preceding
pages
but
their
purport
will
still
better
appear
when

entered

all
that

many

besides
if
i
nevertheless
make
a

mention

it
is
because
he
raised
mutual

to
the
height
of
a

more

hear

for

watch

snatching
from

set

the

maddened
by
hunger
the
robber

precautions

suddenly
dashes
into
the

mass

attacked
from
all
sides
he
again
is
compelled
to
retreat

sheer
despair
he
falls
upon

the
intelligent
social
birds
rapidly
gather
in
a
flock
and
fly
away
if
the
robber
is
an
erne
they
plunge
into
the
lake
if
it
is
a
falcon
or
they
raise
a
cloud
of
and
bewilder
the
assailant
if
it
is
a
kite
and
while
life
continues
to
swarm
on
the
lake
the
robber
flies
away
with
cries
of
anger
and
looks
out
for
carrion
or
for
a
young
bird
or
a
not
yet
used
to
obey
in
time
the
warnings
of
its
comrades
in
the
face
of

exuberant

must
be
satisfied

the
of

filled
with
the
most
charming
descriptions
of
the
peace
and
harmony
which
prevail
in
almost
all
these
nesting
associations
as
to
the
protection
derived
by
the
weakest
birds
from
their
unions
it
is
evident
that
excellent
observer
coues
saw
for
instance
the
little
nesting
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
prairie
falcon
falco
polyargus
the
falcon
had
its
nest
on
the
top
of
one
of
the
minarets
of
clay
which
are
so
common
in
the
canons
of
colorado
while
a
colony
of
swallows
nested
just
beneath
the
little
peaceful
birds
had
no
fear
of
their
rapacious
neighbour
they
never
let
it
approach
to
their
colony
they
immediately
surrounded
it
and
chased
it
so
that
it
had
to
make
off
at
once
life
in
societies
does
not
cease
when
the
nesting
period
is
over
it
begins
then
in
a
new
form
the
young
broods
gather
in
societies
of
youngsters
generally
including
several
species
social
life
is
practised
at
that
time
chiefly
for
its
own
sake
partly
for
security
but
chiefly
for
the
pleasures
derived
from
it
so
we
see
in
our
forests
the
societies
formed
by
the
young
nuthatchers
sitta
caesia
together
with
chaffinches
wrens
or
some
in
spain
the
swallow
is
met
with
in
company
with
kestrels
and
even
pigeons
in
the
far
west
of
america
the
young
horned
larks
live
in
large
societies
together
with
another
lark
sprague
the
skylark
the
savannah
sparrow
and
several
species
of
buntings
and
longspurs
in
fact
it
would
be
much
easier
to
describe
the
species
which
live
isolated
than
to
simply
name
those
species
which
join
the
autumnal
societies
of
young
birds
not
for
hunting
or
nesting
purposes
but
simply
to
enjoy
life
in
society
and
to
spend
their
time
in
plays
and
sports
after
having
given
a
few
hours
every
day
to
find
their
daily
food
and
finally
we
have
that
immense
display
of
mutual
aid
among
migrations
which
i
dare
not
even
enter
upon
in
this
place
sufficient
to
say
that
birds
which
have
lived
for
months
in
small
bands
scattered
over
a
wide
territory
gather
in
thousands
they
come
together
at
a
given
place
for
several
days
in
succession
before
they
start
and
they
evidently
discuss
the
particulars
of
the
journey
some
species
will
indulge
every
afternoon
in
flights
preparatory
to
the
long
passage
all
wait
for
their
tardy
congeners
and
finally
they
start
in
a
certain
well
chosen
direction
a
fruit
of
accumulated
collective
experience
the
strongest
flying
at
the
head
of
the
band
and
relieving
one
another
in
that
difficult
task
they
cross
the
seas
in
large
bands
consisting
of
both
big
and
small
birds
and
when
they
return
next
spring
they
repair
to
the
same
spot
and
in
most
cases
each
of
them
takes
possession
of
the
very
same
nest
which
it
had
built
or
repaired
the
previous
year
this
subject
is
so
vast
and
yet
so
imperfectly
studied
it
offers
so
many
striking
illustrations
of
habits
subsidiary
to
the
main
fact
of
migration
each
of
which
would
however
require
a
special
study
that
i
must
refrain
from
entering
here
into
more
details
i
can
only
cursorily
refer
to
the
numerous
and
animated
gatherings
of
birds
which
take
place
always
on
the
same
spot
before
they
begin
their
long
journeys
north
or
south
as
also
those
which
one
sees
in
the
north
after
the
birds
have
arrived
at
their
on
the
yenisei
or
in
the
northern
counties
of
england
for
many
days
in
succession
sometimes
one
month
they
will
come
together
every
morning
for
one
hour
before
flying
in
search
of
food
perhaps
discussing
the
spot
where
they
are
going
to
build
their
nests
and
if
during
the
migration
their
columns
are
overtaken
by
a
storm
birds
of
the
most
different
species
will
be
brought
together
by
common
misfortune
the
birds
which
are
not
exactly
migratory
but
slowly
move
northwards
and
southwards
with
the
seasons
also
perform
these
peregrinations
in
flocks
so
far
from
migrating
isolately
in
order
to
secure
for
each
separate
individual
the
advantages
of
better
food
or
shelter
which
are
to
be
found
in
another
district
they
always
wait
for
each
other
and
gather
in
flocks
before
they
move
north
or
south
in
accordance
with
the
season
going
now
over
to
mammals
the
first
thing
which
strikes
us
is
the
overwhelming
numerical
predominance
of
social
species
over
those
few
carnivores
which
do
not
associate
the
plateaus
the
alpine
tracts
and
the
steppes
of
the
old
and
new
world
are
stocked
with
herds
of
deer
antelopes
gazelles
fallow
deer
buffaloes
wild
goats
and
sheep
all
of
which
are
sociable
animals
when
the
europeans
came
to
settle
in
america
they
found
it
so
densely
peopled
with
buffaloes
that
pioneers
had
to
stop
their
advance
when
a
column
of
migrating
buffaloes
came
to
cross
the
route
they
followed
the
march
past
of
the
dense
column
lasting
sometimes
for
two
and
three
days
and
when
the
russians
took
possession
of
siberia
they
found
it
so
densely
peopled
with
deer
antelopes
squirrels
and
other
sociable
animals
that
the
very
conquest
of
siberia
was
nothing
but
a
hunting
expedition
which
lasted
for
two
hundred
years
while
the
grass
plains
of
eastern
africa
are
still
covered
with
herds
composed
of
zebra
the
hartebeest
and
other
antelopes
not
long
ago
the
small
streams
of
northern
america
and
northern
siberia
were
peopled
with
colonies
of
beavers
and
up
to
the
seventeenth
century
like
colonies
swarmed
in
northern
russia
the
flat
lands
of
the
four
great
continents
are
still
covered
with
countless
colonies
of
mice
marmots
and
other
rodents
in
the
lower
latitudes
of
asia
and
africa
the
forests
are
still
the
abode
of
numerous
families
of
elephants
rhinoceroses
and
numberless
societies
of
monkeys
in
the
far
north
the
reindeer
aggregate
in
numberless
herds
while
still
further
north
we
find
the
herds
of
the
and
numberless
bands
of
polar
foxes
the
coasts
of
the
ocean
are
enlivened
by
flocks
of
seals
and
morses
its
waters
by
shoals
of
sociable
cetaceans
and
even
in
the
depths
of
the
great
plateau
of
central
asia
we
find
herds
of
wild
horses
wild
donkeys
wild
camels
and
wild
sheep
all
these
mammals
live
in
societies
and
nations
sometimes
numbering
hundreds
of
thousands
of
individuals
although
now
after
three
centuries
of
gunpowder
civilization
we
find
but
the
debris
of
the
immense
aggregations
of
old
how
trifling
in
comparison
with
them
are
the
numbers
of
the
carnivores
and
how
false
therefore
is
the
view
of
those
who
speak
of
the
animal
world
as
if
nothing
were
to
be
seen
in
it
but
lions
and
hyenas
plunging
their
bleeding
teeth
into
the
flesh
of
their
victims
one
might
as
well
imagine
that
the
whole
of
human
life
is
nothing
but
a
succession
of
war
massacres
association
and
mutual
aid
are
the
rule
with
mammals
we
find
social
habits
even
among
the
carnivores
and
we
can
only
name
the
cat
tribe
lions
tigers
leopards
etc
as
a
division
the
members
of
which
decidedly
prefer
isolation
to
society
and
are
but
seldom
met
with
even
in
small
groups
and
yet
even
among
lions
this
is
a
very
common
practice
to
hunt
in
company
the
two
tribes
of
the
civets
viverridae
and
the
weasels
mustelidae
might
also
be
characterized
by
their
isolated
life
but
it
is
a
fact
that
during
the
last
century
the
common
weasel
was
more
sociable
than
it
is
now
it
was
seen
then
in
larger
groups
in
scotland
and
in
the
unterwalden
canton
of
switzerland
as
to
the
great
tribe
of
the
dogs
it
is
eminently
sociable
and
association
for
hunting
purposes
may
be
considered
as
eminently
characteristic
of
its
numerous
species
it
is
well
known
in
fact
that
wolves
gather
in
packs
for
hunting
and
tschudi
left
an
excellent
description
of
how
they
draw
up
in
a
surround
a
cow
which
is
grazing
on
a
mountain
slope
and
then
suddenly
appearing
with
a
loud
barking
make
it
roll
in
the
abyss
audubon
in
the
thirties
also
saw
the
labrador
wolves
hunting
in
packs
and
one
pack
following
a
man
to
his
cabin
and
killing
the
dogs
during
severe
winters
the
packs
of
wolves
grow
so
numerous
as
to
become
a
danger
for
human
settlements
as
was
the
case
in
france
some
years
ago
in
the
russian
steppes
they
never
attack
the
horses
otherwise
than
in
packs
and
yet
they
have
to
sustain
bitter
fights
during
which
the
horses
according
to
kohl
testimony
sometimes
assume
offensive
warfare
and
in
such
cases
if
the
wolves
do
not
retreat
promptly
they
run
the
risk
of
being
surrounded
by
the
horses
and
killed
by
their
hoofs
the
canis
latrans
are
known
to
associate
in
bands
of
from
twenty
to
thirty
individuals
when
they
chase
a
buffalo
occasionally
separated
from
its
herd
jackals
which
are
most
courageous
and
may
be
considered
as
one
of
the
most
intelligent
representatives
of
the
dog
tribe
always
hunt
in
packs
thus
united
they
have
no
fear
of
the
bigger
carnivores
as
to
the
wild
dogs
of
asia
the
kholzuns
or
dholes
williamson
saw
their
large
packs
attacking
all
larger
animals
save
elephants
and
rhinoceroses
and
overpowering
bears
and
tigers
hyenas
always
live
in
societies
and
hunt
in
packs
and
the
hunting
organizations
of
the
painted
lycaons
are
highly
praised
by
cumming
nay
even
foxes
which
as
a
rule
live
isolated
in
our
civilized
countries
have
been
seen
combining
for
hunting
purposes
as
to
the
polar
fox
it
is
or
rather
was
in
steller
time
one
of
the
most
sociable
animals
and
when
one
reads
steller
description
of
the
war
that
was
waged
by
behring
unfortunate
crew
against
these
intelligent
small
animals
one
does
not
know
what
to
wonder
at
most
the
extraordinary
intelligence
of
the
foxes
and
the
mutual
aid
they
displayed
in
digging
out
food
concealed
under
cairns
or
stored
upon
a
pillar
one
fox
would
climb
on
its
top
and
throw
the
food
to
its
comrades
beneath
or
the
cruelty
of
man
driven
to
despair
by
the
numerous
packs
of
foxes
even
some
bears
live
in
societies
where
they
are
not
disturbed
by
man
thus
steller
saw
the
black
bear
of
kamtchatka
in
numerous
packs
and
the
polar
bears
are
occasionally
found
in
small
groups
even
the
unintelligent
insectivores
do
not
always
disdain
association
however
it
is
especially
with
the
rodents
the
ungulata
and
the
ruminants
that
we
find
a
highly
developed
practice
of
mutual
aid
the
squirrels
are
individualist
to
a
great
extent
each
of
them
builds
its
own
comfortable
nest
and
accumulates
its
own
provision
their
inclinations
are
towards
family
life
and
brehm
found
that
a
family
of
squirrels
is
never
so
happy
as
when
the
two
broods
of
the
same
year
can
join
together
with
their
parents
in
a
remote
corner
of
a
forest
and
yet
they
maintain
social
relations
the
inhabitants
of
the
separate
nests
remain
in
a
close
intercourse
and
when
the
become
rare
in
the
forest
they
inhabit
they
emigrate
in
bands
as
to
the
black
squirrels
of
the
far
west
they
are
eminently
sociable
apart
from
the
few
hours
given
every
day
to
foraging
they
spend
their
lives
in
playing
in
numerous
parties
and
when
they
multiply
too
rapidly
in
a
region
they
assemble
in
bands
almost
as
numerous
as
those
of
locusts
and
move
southwards
devastating
the
forests
the
fields
and
the
gardens
while
foxes
polecats
falcons
and
nocturnal
birds
of
prey
follow
their
thick
columns
and
live
upon
the
individuals
remaining
behind
the
a
genus
is
still
more
sociable
it
is
given
to
hoarding
and
stores
up
in
its
subterranean
halls
large
amounts
of
edible
roots
and
nuts
usually
plundered
by
man
in
the
autumn
according
to
some
observers
it
must
know
something
of
the
joys
of
a
miser
and
yet
it
remains
sociable
it
always
lives
in
large
villages
and
audubon
who
opened
some
dwellings
of
the
hackee
in
the
winter
found
several
individuals
in
the
same
apartment
they
must
have
stored
it
with
common
efforts
the
large
tribe
of
the
marmots
which
includes
the
three
large
genuses
of
arctomys
cynomys
and
spermophilus
is
still
more
sociable
and
still
more
intelligent
they
also
prefer
having
each
one
its
own
dwelling
but
they
live
in
big
villages
that
terrible
enemy
of
the
crops
of
south
russia
the
souslik
of
which
some
ten
millions
are
exterminated
every
year
by
man
alone
lives
in
numberless
colonies
and
while
the
russian
provincial
assemblies
gravely
discuss
the
means
of
getting
rid
of
this
enemy
of
society
it
enjoys
life
in
its
thousands
in
the
most
joyful
way
their
play
is
so
charming
that
no
observer
could
refrain
from
paying
them
a
tribute
of
praise
and
from
mentioning
the
melodious
concerts
arising
from
the
sharp
whistlings
of
the
males
and
the
melancholic
whistlings
of
the
females
before
suddenly
returning
to
his
citizen
duties
he
begins
inventing
the
most
diabolic
means
for
the
extermination
of
the
little
robbers
all
kinds
of
rapacious
birds
and
beasts
of
prey
having
proved
powerless
the
last
word
of
science
in
this
warfare
is
the
inoculation
of
cholera
the
villages
of
the
in
america
are
one
of
the
loveliest
sights
as
far
as
the
eye
can
embrace
the
prairie
it
sees
heaps
of
earth
and
on
each
of
them
a
stands
engaged
in
a
lively
conversation
with
its
neighbours
by
means
of
short
barkings
as
soon
as
the
approach
of
man
is
signalled
all
plunge
in
a
moment
into
their
dwellings
all
have
disappeared
as
by
enchantment
but
if
the
danger
is
over
the
little
creatures
soon
reappear
whole
families
come
out
of
their
galleries
and
indulge
in
play
the
young
ones
scratch
one
another
they
worry
one
another
and
display
their
gracefulness
while
standing
upright
and
in
the
meantime
the
old
ones
keep
watch
they
go
visiting
one
another
and
the
beaten
footpaths
which
connect
all
their
heaps
testify
to
the
frequency
of
the
visitations
in
short
the
best
naturalists
have
written
some
of
their
best
pages
in
describing
the
associations
of
the
of
america
the
marmots
of
the
old
world
and
the
polar
marmots
of
the
alpine
regions
and
yet
i
must
make
as
regards
the
marmots
the
same
remark
as
i
have
made
when
speaking
of
the
bees
they
have
maintained
their
fighting
instincts
and
these
instincts
reappear
in
captivity
but
in
their
big
associations
in
the
face
of
free
nature
the
unsociable
instincts
have
no
opportunity
to
develop
and
the
general
result
is
peace
and
harmony
even
such
harsh
animals
as
the
rats
which
continually
fight
in
our
cellars
are
sufficiently
intelligent
not
to
quarrel
when
they
plunder
our
larders
but
to
aid
one
another
in
their
plundering
expeditions
and
migrations
and
even
to
feed
their
invalids
as
to
the
or
of
canada
they
are
extremely
sociable
audubon
could
not
but
admire
their
peaceful
communities
which
require
only
being
left
in
peace
to
enjoy
happiness
like
all
sociable
animals
they
are
lively
and
playful
they
easily
combine
with
other
species
and
they
have
attained
a
very
high
degree
of
intellectual
development
in
their
villages
always
disposed
on
the
shores
of
lakes
and
rivers
they
take
into
account
the
changing
level
of
water
their
domeshaped
houses
which
are
built
of
beaten
clay
interwoven
with
reeds
have
separate
corners
for
organic
refuse
and
their
halls
are
well
carpeted
at
winter
time
they
are
warm
and
nevertheless
well
ventilated
as
to
the
beavers
which
are
endowed
as
known
with
a
most
sympathetic
character
their
astounding
dams
and
villages
in
which
generations
live
and
die
without
knowing
of
any
enemies
but
the
otter
and
man
so
wonderfully
illustrate
what
mutual
aid
can
achieve
for
the
security
of
the
species
the
development
of
social
habits
and
the
evolution
of
intelligence
that
they
are
familiar
to
all
interested
in
animal
life
let
me
only
remark
that
with
the
beavers
the
muskrats
and
some
other
rodents
we
already
find
the
feature
which
will
also
be
distinctive
of
human
communities
that
is
work
in
common
i
pass
in
silence
the
two
large
families
which
include
the
jerboa
the
chinchilla
the
biscacha
and
the
tushkan
or
underground
hare
of
south
russia
though
all
these
small
rodents
might
be
taken
as
excellent
illustrations
of
the
pleasures
derived
by
animals
from
social
life
precisely
the
pleasures
because
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
say
what
brings
animals
together
the
needs
of
mutual
protection
or
simply
the
pleasure
of
feeling
surrounded
by
their
congeners
at
any
rate
our
common
hares
which
do
not
gather
in
societies
for
life
in
common
and
which
are
not
even
endowed
with
intense
parental
feelings
can
not
live
without
coming
together
for
play
dietrich
de
winckell
who
is
considered
to
be
among
the
best
acquainted
with
the
habits
of
hares
describes
them
as
passionate
players
becoming
so
intoxicated
by
their
play
that
a
hare
has
been
known
to
take
an
approaching
fox
for
a
playmate
as
to
the
rabbit
it
lives
in
societies
and
its
family
life
is
entirely
built
upon
the
image
of
the
old
patriarchal
family
the
young
ones
being
kept
in
absolute
obedience
to
the
father
and
even
the
grandfather
and
here
we
have
the
example
of
two
very
species
which
can
not
bear
each
other
not
because
they
live
upon
nearly
the
same
food
as
like
cases
are
too
often
explained
but
most
probably
because
the
passionate
hare
can
not
make
friends
with
that
placid
quiet
and
submissive
creature
the
rabbit
their
tempers
are
too
widely
different
not
to
be
an
obstacle
to
friendship
life
in
societies
is
again
the
rule
with
the
large
family
of
horses
which
includes
the
wild
horses
and
donkeys
of
asia
the
zebras
the
mustangs
the
cimarrones
of
the
pampas
and
the
horses
of
mongolia
and
siberia
they
all
live
in
numerous
associations
made
up
of
many
studs
each
of
which
consists
of
a
number
of
mares
under
the
leadership
of
a
male
these
numberless
inhabitants
of
the
old
and
the
new
world
badly
organized
on
the
whole
for
resisting
both
their
numerous
enemies
and
the
adverse
conditions
of
climate
would
soon
have
disappeared
from
the
surface
of
the
earth
were
it
not
for
their
sociable
spirit
when
a
beast
of
prey
approaches
them
several
studs
unite
at
once
they
repulse
the
beast
and
sometimes
chase
it
and
neither
the
wolf
nor
the
bear
not
even
the
lion
can
capture
a
horse
or
even
a
zebra
as
long
as
they
are
not
detached
from
the
herd
when
a
drought
is
burning
the
grass
in
the
prairies
they
gather
in
herds
of
sometimes
individuals
strong
and
migrate
and
when
a
rages
in
the
steppes
each
stud
keeps
close
together
and
repairs
to
a
protected
ravine
but
if
confidence
disappears
or
the
group
has
been
seized
by
panic
and
disperses
the
horses
perish
and
the
survivors
are
found
after
the
storm
half
dying
from
fatigue
union
is
their
chief
arm
in
the
struggle
for
life
and
man
is
their
chief
enemy
before
his
increasing
numbers
the
ancestors
of
our
domestic
horse
the
equus
przewalskii
so
named
by
polyakoff
have
preferred
to
retire
to
the
wildest
and
least
accessible
plateaus
on
the
outskirts
of
thibet
where
they
continue
to
live
surrounded
by
carnivores
under
a
climate
as
bad
as
that
of
the
arctic
regions
but
in
a
region
inaccessible
to
man
many
striking
illustrations
of
social
life
could
be
taken
from
the
life
of
the
reindeer
and
especially
of
that
large
division
of
ruminants
which
might
include
the
roebucks
the
fallow
deer
the
antelopes
the
gazelles
the
ibex
and
in
fact
the
whole
of
the
three
numerous
families
of
the
antelopides
the
caprides
and
the
ovides
their
watchfulness
over
the
safety
of
their
herds
against
attacks
of
carnivores
the
anxiety
displayed
by
all
individuals
in
a
herd
of
chamois
as
long
as
all
of
them
have
not
cleared
a
difficult
passage
over
rocky
cliffs
the
adoption
of
orphans
the
despair
of
the
gazelle
whose
mate
or
even
comrade
of
the
same
sex
has
been
killed
the
plays
of
the
youngsters
and
many
other
features
could
be
mentioned
but
perhaps
the
most
striking
illustration
of
mutual
support
is
given
by
the
occasional
migrations
of
fallow
deer
such
as
i
saw
once
on
the
amur
when
i
crossed
the
high
plateau
and
its
border
ridge
the
great
khingan
on
my
way
from
transbaikalia
to
merghen
and
further
travelled
over
the
high
prairies
on
my
way
to
the
amur
i
could
ascertain
how
with
fallow
deer
these
mostly
uninhabited
regions
are
two
years
later
i
was
travelling
up
the
amur
and
by
the
end
of
october
reached
the
lower
end
of
that
picturesque
gorge
which
the
amur
pierces
in
the
little
khingan
before
it
enters
the
lowlands
where
it
joins
the
sungari
i
found
the
cossacks
in
the
villages
of
that
gorge
in
the
greatest
excitement
because
thousands
and
thousands
of
fallow
deer
were
crossing
the
amur
where
it
is
narrowest
in
order
to
reach
the
lowlands
for
several
days
in
succession
upon
a
length
of
some
forty
miles
up
the
river
the
cossacks
were
butchering
the
deer
as
they
crossed
the
amur
in
which
already
floated
a
good
deal
of
ice
thousands
were
killed
every
day
and
the
exodus
nevertheless
continued
like
migrations
were
never
seen
either
before
or
since
and
this
one
must
have
been
called
for
by
an
early
and
heavy
in
the
great
khingan
which
compelled
the
deer
to
make
a
desperate
attempt
at
reaching
the
lowlands
in
the
east
of
the
dousse
mountains
indeed
a
few
days
later
the
was
also
buried
under
snow
two
or
three
feet
deep
now
when
one
imagines
the
immense
territory
almost
as
big
as
great
britain
from
which
the
scattered
groups
of
deer
must
have
gathered
for
a
migration
which
was
undertaken
under
the
pressure
of
exceptional
circumstances
and
realizes
the
difficulties
which
had
to
be
overcome
before
all
the
deer
came
to
the
common
idea
of
crossing
the
amur
further
south
where
it
is
narrowest
one
can
not
but
deeply
admire
the
amount
of
sociability
displayed
by
these
intelligent
animals
the
fact
is
not
the
less
striking
if
we
remember
that
the
buffaloes
of
north
america
displayed
the
same
powers
of
combination
one
saw
them
grazing
in
great
numbers
in
the
plains
but
these
numbers
were
made
up
by
an
infinity
of
small
groups
which
never
mixed
together
and
yet
when
necessity
arose
all
groups
however
scattered
over
an
immense
territory
came
together
and
made
up
those
immense
columns
numbering
hundreds
of
thousands
of
individuals
which
i
mentioned
on
a
preceding
page
i
also
ought
to
say
a
few
words
at
least
about
the
compound
families
of
the
elephants
their
mutual
attachment
their
deliberate
ways
in
posting
sentries
and
the
feelings
of
sympathy
developed
by
such
a
life
of
close
mutual
support
i
might
mention
the
sociable
feelings
of
those
disreputable
creatures
the
wild
boars
and
find
a
word
of
praise
for
their
powers
of
association
in
the
case
of
an
attack
by
a
beast
of
prey
the
hippopotamus
and
the
rhinoceros
too
would
occupy
a
place
in
a
work
devoted
to
animal
sociability
several
striking
pages
might
be
given
to
the
sociability
and
mutual
attachment
of
the
seals
and
the
walruses
and
finally
one
might
mention
the
most
excellent
feelings
existing
among
the
sociable
cetaceans
but
i
have
to
say
yet
a
few
words
about
the
societies
of
monkeys
which
acquire
an
additional
interest
from
their
being
the
link
which
will
bring
us
to
the
societies
of
primitive
men
it
is
hardly
needful
to
say
that
those
mammals
which
stand
at
the
very
top
of
the
animal
world
and
most
approach
man
by
their
structure
and
intelligence
are
eminently
sociable
evidently
we
must
be
prepared
to
meet
with
all
varieties
of
character
and
habits
in
so
great
a
division
of
the
animal
kingdom
which
includes
hundreds
of
species
but
all
things
considered
it
must
be
said
that
sociability
action
in
common
mutual
protection
and
a
high
development
of
those
feelings
which
are
the
necessary
outcome
of
social
life
are
characteristic
of
most
monkeys
and
apes
from
the
smallest
species
to
the
biggest
ones
sociability
is
a
rule
to
which
we
know
but
a
few
exceptions
the
nocturnal
apes
prefer
isolated
life
the
capuchins
cebus
capucinus
the
monos
and
the
howling
monkeys
live
but
in
small
families
and
the
have
never
been
seen
by
wallace
otherwise
than
either
solitary
or
in
very
small
groups
of
three
or
four
individuals
while
the
gorillas
seem
never
to
join
in
bands
but
all
the
remainder
of
the
monkey
tribe
the
chimpanzees
the
sajous
the
sakis
the
mandrills
the
baboons
and
so
on
are
sociable
in
the
highest
degree
they
live
in
great
bands
and
even
join
with
other
species
than
their
own
most
of
them
become
quite
unhappy
when
solitary
the
cries
of
distress
of
each
one
of
the
band
immediately
bring
together
the
whole
of
the
band
and
they
boldly
repulse
the
attacks
of
most
carnivores
and
birds
of
prey
even
eagles
do
not
dare
attack
them
they
plunder
our
fields
always
in
bands
the
old
ones
taking
care
for
the
safety
of
the
commonwealth
the
little
whose
childish
sweet
faces
so
much
struck
humboldt
embrace
and
protect
one
another
when
it
rains
rolling
their
tails
over
the
necks
of
their
shivering
comrades
several
species
display
the
greatest
solicitude
for
their
wounded
and
do
not
abandon
a
wounded
comrade
during
a
retreat
till
they
have
ascertained
that
it
is
dead
and
that
they
are
helpless
to
restore
it
to
life
thus
james
forbes
narrated
in
his
oriental
memoirs
a
fact
of
such
resistance
in
reclaiming
from
his
hunting
party
the
dead
body
of
a
female
monkey
that
one
fully
understands
why
the
witnesses
of
this
extraordinary
scene
resolved
never
again
to
fire
at
one
of
the
monkey
race
in
some
species
several
individuals
will
combine
to
overturn
a
stone
in
order
to
search
for
ants
eggs
under
it
the
hamadryas
not
only
post
sentries
but
have
been
seen
making
a
chain
for
the
transmission
of
the
spoil
to
a
safe
place
and
their
courage
is
well
known
brehm
description
of
the
regular
fight
which
his
caravan
had
to
sustain
before
the
hamadryas
would
let
it
resume
its
journey
in
the
valley
of
the
mensa
in
abyssinia
has
become
classical
the
playfulness
of
the
tailed
apes
and
the
mutual
attachment
which
reigns
in
the
families
of
chimpanzees
also
are
familiar
to
the
general
reader
and
if
we
find
among
the
highest
apes
two
species
the
and
the
gorilla
which
are
not
sociable
we
must
remember
that
both
limited
as
they
are
to
very
small
areas
the
one
in
the
heart
of
africa
and
the
other
in
the
two
islands
of
borneo
and
sumatra
have
all
the
appearance
of
being
the
last
remnants
of
formerly
much
more
numerous
species
the
gorilla
at
least
seems
to
have
been
sociable
in
olden
times
if
the
apes
mentioned
in
the
periplus
really
were
gorillas
we
thus
see
even
from
the
above
brief
review
that
life
in
societies
is
no
exception
in
the
animal
world
it
is
the
rule
the
law
of
nature
and
it
reaches
its
fullest
development
with
the
higher
vertebrates
those
species
which
live
solitary
or
in
small
families
only
are
relatively
few
and
their
numbers
are
limited
nay
it
appears
very
probable
that
apart
from
a
few
exceptions
those
birds
and
mammals
which
are
not
gregarious
now
were
living
in
societies
before
man
multiplied
on
the
earth
and
waged
a
permanent
war
against
them
or
destroyed
the
sources
from
which
they
formerly
derived
food
on
ne
pas
pour
mourir
was
the
sound
remark
of
espinas
and
houzeau
who
knew
the
animal
world
of
some
parts
of
america
when
it
was
not
yet
affected
by
man
wrote
to
the
same
effect
association
is
found
in
the
animal
world
at
all
degrees
of
evolution
and
according
to
the
grand
idea
of
herbert
spencer
so
brilliantly
developed
in
perrier
colonies
animales
colonies
are
at
the
very
origin
of
evolution
in
the
animal
kingdom
but
in
proportion
as
we
ascend
the
scale
of
evolution
we
see
association
growing
more
and
more
conscious
it
loses
its
purely
physical
character
it
ceases
to
be
simply
instinctive
it
becomes
reasoned
with
the
higher
vertebrates
it
is
periodical
or
is
resorted
to
for
the
satisfaction
of
a
given
want
propagation
of
the
species
migration
hunting
or
mutual
defence
it
even
becomes
occasional
when
birds
associate
against
a
robber
or
mammals
combine
under
the
pressure
of
exceptional
circumstances
to
emigrate
in
this
last
case
it
becomes
a
voluntary
deviation
from
habitual
moods
of
life
the
combination
sometimes
appears
in
two
or
more
degrees
the
family
first
then
the
group
and
finally
the
association
of
groups
habitually
scattered
but
uniting
in
case
of
need
as
we
saw
it
with
the
bisons
and
other
ruminants
it
also
takes
higher
forms
guaranteeing
more
independence
to
the
individual
without
depriving
it
of
the
benefits
of
social
life
with
most
rodents
the
individual
has
its
own
dwelling
which
it
can
retire
to
when
it
prefers
being
left
alone
but
the
dwellings
are
laid
out
in
villages
and
cities
so
as
to
guarantee
to
all
inhabitants
the
benefits
and
joys
of
social
life
and
finally
in
several
species
such
as
rats
marmots
hares
sociable
life
is
maintained
notwithstanding
the
quarrelsome
or
otherwise
egotistic
inclinations
of
the
isolated
individual
thus
it
is
not
imposed
as
is
the
case
with
ants
and
bees
by
the
very
physiological
structure
of
the
individuals
it
is
cultivated
for
the
benefits
of
mutual
aid
or
for
the
sake
of
its
pleasures
and
this
of
course
appears
with
all
possible
gradations
and
with
the
greatest
variety
of
individual
and
specific
characters
the
very
variety
of
aspects
taken
by
social
life
being
a
consequence
and
for
us
a
further
proof
of
its
generality
sociability
that
is
the
need
of
the
animal
of
associating
with
its
like
the
love
of
society
for
society
sake
combined
with
the
joy
of
life
only
now
begins
to
receive
due
attention
from
the
zoologists
we
know
at
the
present
time
that
all
animals
beginning
with
the
ants
going
on
to
the
birds
and
ending
with
the
highest
mammals
are
fond
of
plays
wrestling
running
after
each
other
trying
to
capture
each
other
teasing
each
other
and
so
on
and
while
many
plays
are
so
to
speak
a
school
for
the
proper
behaviour
of
the
young
in
mature
life
there
are
others
which
apart
from
their
utilitarian
purposes
are
together
with
dancing
and
singing
mere
manifestations
of
an
excess
of
forces
the
joy
of
life
and
a
desire
to
communicate
in
some
way
or
another
with
other
individuals
of
the
same
or
of
other
species
in
short
a
manifestation
of
sociability
proper
which
is
a
distinctive
feature
of
all
the
animal
world
whether
the
feeling
be
fear
experienced
at
the
appearance
of
a
bird
of
prey
or
a
fit
of
gladness
which
bursts
out
when
the
animals
are
in
good
health
and
especially
when
young
or
merely
the
desire
of
giving
play
to
an
excess
of
impressions
and
of
vital
power
the
necessity
of
communicating
impressions
of
playing
of
chattering
or
of
simply
feeling
the
proximity
of
other
kindred
living
beings
pervades
nature
and
is
as
much
as
any
other
physiological
function
a
distinctive
feature
of
life
and
impressionability
this
need
takes
a
higher
development
and
attains
a
more
beautiful
expression
in
mammals
especially
amidst
their
young
and
still
more
among
the
birds
but
it
pervades
all
nature
and
has
been
fully
observed
by
the
best
naturalists
including
pierre
huber
even
amongst
the
ants
and
it
is
evidently
the
same
instinct
which
brings
together
the
big
columns
of
butterflies
which
have
been
referred
to
already
the
habit
of
coming
together
for
dancing
and
of
decorating
the
places
where
the
birds
habitually
perform
their
dances
is
of
course
well
known
from
the
pages
that
darwin
gave
to
this
subject
in
the
descent
of
man
ch
xiii
visitors
of
the
london
zoological
gardens
also
know
the
bower
of
the
satin
but
this
habit
of
dancing
seems
to
be
much
more
widely
spread
than
was
formerly
believed
and
hudson
gives
in

the
most
interesting
description
which
must
be
read
in
the
original
of
complicated
dances
performed
by
quite
a
number
of
birds
rails
jacanas
lapwings
and
so
on
the
habit
of
singing
in
concert
which
exists
in
several
species
of
birds
belongs
to
the
same
category
of
social
instincts
it
is
most
strikingly
developed
with
the
chakar
chauna
chavarris
to
which
the
english
have
given
the
most
unimaginative
misnomer
of

these
birds
sometimes
assemble
in
immense
flocks
and
in
such
cases
they
frequently
sing
all
in
concert
hudson
found
them
once
in
countless
numbers
ranged
all
round
a
pampas
lake
in
flocks
of
about
birds
in
each
flock
presently
he
writes
one
flock
near
me
began
singing
and
continued
their
powerful
chant
for
three
or
four
minutes
when
they
ceased
the
next
flock
took
up
the
strains
and
after
it
the
next
and
so
on
until
once
more
the
notes
of
the
flocks
on
the
opposite
shore
came
floating
strong
and
clear
across
the
water
then
passed
away
growing
fainter
and
fainter
until
once
more
the
sound
approached
me
travelling
round
to
my
side
again
on
another
occasion
the
same
writer
saw
a
whole
plain
covered
with
an
endless
flock
of
chakars
not
in
close
order
but
scattered
in
pairs
and
small
groups
about
nine
in
the
evening
suddenly
the
entire
multitude
of
birds
covering
the
marsh
for
miles
around
burst
forth
in
a
tremendous
evening
song
it
was
a
concert
well
worth
riding
a
hundred
miles
to
hear
it
may
be
added
that
like
all
sociable
animals
the
chakar
easily
becomes
tame
and
grows
very
attached
to
man
they
are
birds
and
very
rarely
quarrel
we
are
told
although
they
are
well
provided
with
formidable
weapons
life
in
societies
renders
these
weapons
useless
that
life
in
societies
is
the
most
powerful
weapon
in
the
struggle
for
life
taken
in
its
widest
sense
has
been
illustrated
by
several
examples
on
the
foregoing
pages
and
could
be
illustrated
by
any
amount
of
evidence
if
further
evidence
were
required
life
in
societies
enables
the
feeblest
insects
the
feeblest
birds
and
the
feeblest
mammals
to
resist
or
to
protect
themselves
from
the
most
terrible
birds
and
beasts
of
prey
it
permits
longevity
it
enables
the
species
to
rear
its
progeny
with
the
least
waste
of
energy
and
to
maintain
its
numbers
albeit
a
very
slow
it
enables
the
gregarious
animals
to
migrate
in
search
of
new
abodes
therefore
while
fully
admitting
that
force
swiftness
protective
colours
cunningness
and
endurance
to
hunger
and
cold
which
are
mentioned
by
darwin
and
wallace
are
so
many
qualities
making
the
individual
or
the
species
the
fittest
under
certain
circumstances
we
maintain
that
under
any
circumstances
sociability
is
the
greatest
advantage
in
the
struggle
for
life
those
species
which
willingly
or
unwillingly
abandon
it
are
doomed
to
decay
while
those
animals
which
know
best
how
to
combine
have
the
greatest
chances
of
survival
and
of
further
evolution
although
they
may
be
inferior
to
others
in
each
of
the
faculties
enumerated
by
darwin
and
wallace
save
the
intellectual
faculty
the
highest
vertebrates
and
especially
mankind
are
the
best
proof
of
this
assertion
as
to
the
intellectual
faculty
while
every
darwinist
will
agree
with
darwin
that
it
is
the
most
powerful
arm
in
the
struggle
for
life
and
the
most
powerful
factor
of
further
evolution
he
also
will
admit
that
intelligence
is
an
eminently
social
faculty
language
imitation
and
accumulated
experience
are
so
many
elements
of
growing
intelligence
of
which
the
unsociable
animal
is
deprived
therefore
we
find
at
the
top
of
each
class
of
animals
the
ants
the
parrots
and
the
monkeys
all
combining
the
greatest
sociability
with
the
highest
development
of
intelligence
the
fittest
are
thus
the
most
sociable
animals
and
sociability
appears
as
the
chief
factor
of
evolution
both
directly
by
securing
the
of
the
species
while
diminishing
the
waste
of
energy
and
indirectly
by
favouring
the
growth
of
intelligence
moreover
it
is
evident
that
life
in
societies
would
be
utterly
impossible
without
a
corresponding
development
of
social
feelings
and
especially
of
a
certain
collective
sense
of
justice
growing
to
become
a
habit
if
every
individual
were
constantly
abusing
its
personal
advantages
without
the
others
interfering
in
favour
of
the
wronged
no
society
life
would
be
possible
and
feelings
of
justice
develop
more
or
less
with
all
gregarious
animals
whatever
the
distance
from
which
the
swallows
or
the
cranes
come
each
one
returns
to
the
nest
it
has
built
or
repaired
last
year
if
a
lazy
sparrow
intends
appropriating
the
nest
which
a
comrade
is
building
or
even
steals
from
it
a
few
sprays
of
straw
the
group
interferes
against
the
lazy
comrade
and
it
is
evident
that
without
such
interference
being
the
rule
no
nesting
associations
of
birds
could
exist
separate
groups
of
penguins
have
separate
and
separate
fishing
abodes
and
do
not
fight
for
them
the
droves
of
cattle
in
australia
have
particular
spots
to
which
each
group
repairs
to
rest
and
from
which
it
never
deviates
and
so
on
we
have
any
numbers
of
direct
observations
of
the
peace
that
prevails
in
the
nesting
associations
of
birds
the
villages
of
the
rodents
and
the
herds
of
while
on
the
other
side
we
know
of
few
sociable
animals
which
so
continually
quarrel
as
the
rats
in
our
cellars
do
or
as
the
morses
which
fight
for
the
possession
of
a
sunny
place
on
the
shore
sociability
thus
puts
a
limit
to
physical
struggle
and
leaves
room
for
the
development
of
better
moral
feelings
the
high
development
of
parental
love
in
all
classes
of
animals
even
with
lions
and
tigers
is
generally
known
as
to
the
young
birds
and
mammals
whom
we
continually
see
associating
sympathy
not
love
attains
a
further
development
in
their
associations
leaving
aside
the
really
touching
facts
of
mutual
attachment
and
compassion
which
have
been
recorded
as
regards
domesticated
animals
and
with
animals
kept
in
captivity
we
have
a
number
of
well
certified
facts
of
compassion
between
wild
animals
at
liberty
max
perty
and
buchner
have
given
a
number
of
such
facts
wood
narrative
of
a
weasel
which
came
to
pick
up
and
to
carry
away
an
injured
comrade
enjoys
a
popularity
so
also
the
observation
of
captain
stansbury
on
his
journey
to
utah
which
is
quoted
by
darwin
he
saw
a
blind
pelican
which
was
fed
and
well
fed
by
other
pelicans
upon
fishes
which
had
to
be
brought
from
a
distance
of
thirty
miles
and
when
a
herd
of
vicunas
was
hotly
pursued
by
hunters
weddell
saw
more
than
once
during
his
journey
to
bolivia
and
peru
the
strong
males
covering
the
retreat
of
the
herd
and
lagging
behind
in
order
to
protect
the
retreat
as
to
facts
of
compassion
with
wounded
comrades
they
are
continually
mentioned
by
all
field
zoologists
such
facts
are
quite
natural
compassion
is
a
necessary
outcome
of
social
life
but
compassion
also
means
a
considerable
advance
in
general
intelligence
and
sensibility
it
is
the
first
step
towards
the
development
of
higher
moral
sentiments
it
is
in
its
turn
a
powerful
factor
of
further
evolution
if
the
views
developed
on
the
preceding
pages
are
correct
the
question
necessarily
arises
in
how
far
are
they
consistent
with
the
theory
of
struggle
for
life
as
it
has
been
developed
by
darwin
wallace
and
their
followers
and
i
will
now
briefly
answer
this
important
question
first
of
all
no
naturalist
will
doubt
that
the
idea
of
a
struggle
for
life
carried
on
through
organic
nature
is
the
greatest
generalization
of
our
century
life
is
struggle
and
in
that
struggle
the
fittest
survive
but
the
answers
to
the
questions
by
which
arms
is
this
struggle
chiefly
carried
on
and
who
are
the
fittest
in
the
struggle
will
widely
differ
according
to
the
importance
given
to
the
two
different
aspects
of
the
struggle
the
direct
one
for
food
and
safety
among
separate
individuals
and
the
struggle
which
darwin
described
as
metaphorical
the
struggle
very
often
collective
against
adverse
circumstances
no
one
will
deny
that
there
is
within
each
species
a
certain
amount
of
real
competition
for
food
at
least
at
certain
periods
but
the
question
is
whether
competition
is
carried
on
to
the
extent
admitted
by
darwin
or
even
by
wallace
and
whether
this
competition
has
played
in
the
evolution
of
the
animal
kingdom
the
part
assigned
to
it
the
idea
which
permeates
darwin
work
is
certainly
one
of
real
competition
going
on
within
each
animal
group
for
food
safety
and
possibility
of
leaving
an
offspring
he
often
speaks
of
regions
being
stocked
with
animal
life
to
their
full
capacity
and
from
that
overstocking
he
infers
the
necessity
of
competition
but
when
we
look
in
his
work
for
real
proofs
of
that
competition
we
must
confess
that
we
do
not
find
them
sufficiently
convincing
if
we
refer
to
the
paragraph
entitled
struggle
for
life
most
severe
between
individuals
and
varieties
of
the
same
species
we
find
in
it
none
of
that
wealth
of
proofs
and
illustrations
which
we
are
accustomed
to
find
in
whatever
darwin
wrote
the
struggle
between
individuals
of
the
same
species
is
not
illustrated
under
that
heading
by
even
one
single
instance
it
is
taken
as
granted
and
the
competition
between
animal
species
is
illustrated
by
but
five
examples
out
of
which
one
at
least
relating
to
the
two
species
of
thrushes
now
proves
to
be
doubtful
but
when
we
look
for
more
details
in
order
to
ascertain
how
far
the
decrease
of
one
species
was
really
occasioned
by
the
increase
of
the
other
species
darwin
with
his
usual
fairness
tells
us
we
can
dimly
see
why
the
competition
should
be
most
severe
between
allied
forms
which
fill
nearly
the
same
place
in
nature
but
probably
in
no
case
could
we
precisely
say
why
one
species
has
been
victorious
over
another
in
the
great
battle
of
life
as
to
wallace
who
quotes
the
same
facts
under
a
heading
struggle
for
life
between
animals
and
plants
often
most
severe
he
makes
the
following
remark
italics
are
mine
which
gives
quite
another
aspect
to
the
facts
above
quoted
he
says
in
some
cases
no
doubt
there
is
actual
war
between
the
two
the
stronger
killing
the
weaker
but
this
is
by
no
means
necessary
and
there
may
be
cases
in
which
the
weaker
species
physically
may
prevail
by
its
power
of
more
rapid
multiplication
its
better
withstanding
vicissitudes
of
climate
or
its
greater
cunning
in
escaping
the
attacks
of
common
enemies
in
such
cases
what
is
described
as
competition
may
be
no
competition
at
all
one
species
succumbs
not
because
it
is
exterminated
or
starved
out
by
the
other
species
but
because
it
does
not
well
accommodate
itself
to
new
conditions
which
the
other
does
the
term
struggle
for
life
is
again
used
in
its
metaphorical
sense
and
may
have
no
other
as
to
the
real
competition
between
individuals
of
the
same
species
which
is
illustrated
in
another
place
by
the
cattle
of
south
america
during
a
period
of
drought
its
value
is
impaired
by
its
being
taken
from
among
domesticated
animals
bisons
emigrate
in
like
circumstances
in
order
to
avoid
competition
however
severe
the
struggle
between
plants
and
this
is
amply
proved
we
can
not
but
repeat
wallace
remark
to
the
effect
that
plants
live
where
they
can
while
animals
have
to
a
great
extent
the
power
of
choice
of
their
abode
so
that
we
again
are
asking
ourselves
to
what
extent
does
competition
really
exist
within
each
animal
species
upon
what
is
the
assumption
based
the
same
remark
must
be
made
concerning
the
indirect
argument
in
favour
of
a
severe
competition
and
struggle
for
life
within
each
species
which
may
be
derived
from
the
extermination
of
transitional
varieties
so
often
mentioned
by
darwin
it
is
known
that
for
a
long
time
darwin
was
worried
by
the
difficulty
which
he
saw
in
the
absence
of
a
long
chain
of
intermediate
forms
between
species
and
that
he
found
the
solution
of
this
difficulty
in
the
supposed
extermination
of
the
intermediate
forms
however
an
attentive
reading
of
the
different
chapters
in
which
darwin
and
wallace
speak
of
this
subject
soon
brings
one
to
the
conclusion
that
the
word
extermination
does
not
mean
real
extermination
the
same
remark
which
darwin
made
concerning
his
expression
struggle
for
existence
evidently
applies
to
the
word
extermination
as
well
it
can
by
no
means
be
understood
in
its
direct
sense
but
must
be
taken
in
its
metaphoric
sense
if
we
start
from
the
supposition
that
a
given
area
is
stocked
with
animals
to
its
fullest
capacity
and
that
a
keen
competition
for
the
sheer
means
of
existence
is
consequently
going
on
between
all
the
inhabitants
each
animal
being
compelled
to
fight
against
all
its
congeners
in
order
to
get
its
daily
food
then
the
appearance
of
a
new
and
successful
variety
would
certainly
mean
in
many
cases
though
not
always
the
appearance
of
individuals
which
are
enabled
to
seize
more
than
their
fair
share
of
the
means
of
existence
and
the
result
would
be
that
those
individuals
would
starve
both
the
parental
form
which
does
not
possess
the
new
variation
and
the
intermediate
forms
which
do
not
possess
it
in
the
same
degree
it
may
be
that
at
the
outset
darwin
understood
the
appearance
of
new
varieties
under
this
aspect
at
least
the
frequent
use
of
the
word
extermination
conveys
such
an
impression
but
both
he
and
wallace
knew
nature
too
well
not
to
perceive
that
this
is
by
no
means
the
only
possible
and
necessary
course
of
affairs
if
the
physical
and
the
biological
conditions
of
a
given
area
the
extension
of
the
area
occupied
by
a
given
species
and
the
habits
of
all
the
members
of
the
latter
remained
unchanged
then
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
new
variety
might
mean
the
starving
out
and
the
extermination
of
all
the
individuals
which
were
not
endowed
in
a
sufficient
degree
with
the
new
feature
by
which
the
new
variety
is
characterized
but
such
a
combination
of
conditions
is
precisely
what
we
do
not
see
in
nature
each
species
is
continually
tending
to
enlarge
its
abode
migration
to
new
abodes
is
the
rule
with
the
slow
snail
as
with
the
swift
bird
physical
changes
are
continually
going
on
in
every
given
area
and
new
varieties
among
animals
consist
in
an
immense
number
of
in
the
majority
not
in
the
growth
of
new
weapons
for
snatching
the
food
from
the
mouth
of
its
congeners
food
is
only
one
out
of
a
hundred
of
various
conditions
of
existence
but
as
wallace
himself
shows
in
a
charming
paragraph
on
the
divergence
of
characters
darwinism
in
forming
new
habits
moving
to
new
abodes
and
taking
to
new
sorts
of
food
in
all
such
cases
there
will
be
no
extermination
even
no
competition
the
new
adaptation
being
a
relief
from
competition
if
it
ever
existed
and
yet
there
will
be
after
a
time
an
absence
of
intermediate
links
in
consequence
of
a
mere
survival
of
those
which
are
best
fitted
for
the
new
conditions
as
surely
as
under
the
hypothesis
of
extermination
of
the
parental
form
it
hardly
need
be
added
that
if
we
admit
with
spencer
all
the
lamarckians
and
darwin
himself
the
modifying
influence
of
the
surroundings
upon
the
species
there
remains
still
less
necessity
for
the
extermination
of
the
intermediate
forms
the
importance
of
migration
and
of
the
consequent
isolation
of
groups
of
animals
for
the
origin
of
new
varieties
and
ultimately
of
new
species
which
was
indicated
by
moritz
wagner
was
fully
recognized
by
darwin
himself
consequent
researches
have
only
accentuated
the
importance
of
this
factor
and
they
have
shown
how
the
largeness
of
the
area
occupied
by
a
given
species
which
darwin
considered
with
full
reason
so
important
for
the
appearance
of
new
varieties
can
be
combined
with
the
isolation
of
parts
of
the
species
in
consequence
of
local
geological
changes
or
of
local
barriers
it
would
be
impossible
to
enter
here
into
the
discussion
of
this
wide
question
but
a
few
remarks
will
do
to
illustrate
the
combined
action
of
these
agencies
it
is
known
that
portions
of
a
given
species
will
often
take
to
a
new
sort
of
food
the
squirrels
for
instance
when
there
is
a
scarcity
of
cones
in
the
larch
forests
remove
to
the
forests
and
this
change
of
food
has
certain
physiological
effects
on
the
squirrels
if
this
change
of
habits
does
not
last
if
next
year
the
cones
are
again
plentiful
in
the
dark
larch
woods
no
new
variety
of
squirrels
will
evidently
arise
from
this
cause
but
if
part
of
the
wide
area
occupied
by
the
squirrels
begins
to
have
its
physical
characters
altered
in
consequence
of
let
us
say
a
milder
climate
or
desiccation
which
both
bring
about
an
increase
of
the
pine
forests
in
proportion
to
the
larch
woods
and
if
some
other
conditions
concur
to
induce
the
squirrels
to
dwell
on
the
outskirts
of
the
desiccating
region
we
shall
have
then
a
new
variety
an
incipient
new
species
of
squirrels
without
there
having
been
anything
that
would
deserve
the
name
of
extermination
among
the
squirrels
a
larger
proportion
of
squirrels
of
the
new
better
adapted
variety
would
survive
every
year
and
the
intermediate
links
would
die
in
the
course
of
time
without
having
been
starved
out
by
malthusian
competitors
this
is
exactly
what
we
see
going
on
during
the
great
physical
changes
which
are
accomplished
over
large
areas
in
central
asia
owing
to
the
desiccation
which
is
going
on
there
since
the
glacial
period
to
take
another
example
it
has
been
proved
by
geologists
that
the
present
wild
horse
equus
przewalski
has
slowly
been
evolved
during
the
later
parts
of
the
tertiary
and
the
quaternary
period
but
that
during
this
succession
of
ages
its
ancestors
were
not
confined
to
some
given
limited
area
of
the
globe
they
wandered
over
both
the
old
and
new
world
returning
in
all
probability
after
a
time
to
the
pastures
which
they
had
in
the
course
of
their
migrations
formerly
left
consequently
if
we
do
not
find
now
in
asia
all
the
intermediate
links
between
the
present
wild
horse
and
its
asiatic
ancestors
this
does
not
mean
at
all
that
the
intermediate
links
have
been
exterminated
no
such
extermination
has
ever
taken
place
no
exceptional
mortality
may
even
have
occurred
among
the
ancestral
species
the
individuals
which
belonged
to
intermediate
varieties
and
species
have
died
in
the
usual
course
of
events
often
amidst
plentiful
food
and
their
remains
were
buried
all
over
the
globe
in
short
if
we
carefully
consider
this
matter
and
carefully
what
darwin
himself
wrote
upon
this
subject
we
see
that
if
the
word
extermination
be
used
at
all
in
connection
with
transitional
varieties
it
must
be
used
in
its
metaphoric
sense
as
to
competition
this
expression
too
is
continually
used
by
darwin
see
for
instance
the
paragraph
on
extinction
as
an
image
or
as
a
rather
than
with
the
intention
of
conveying
the
idea
of
a
real
competition
between
two
portions
of
the
same
species
for
the
means
of
existence
at
any
rate
the
absence
of
intermediate
forms
is
no
argument
in
favour
of
it
in
reality
the
chief
argument
in
favour
of
a
keen
competition
for
the
means
of
existence
continually
going
on
within
every
animal
species
is
to
use
professor
geddes
expression
the
arithmetical
argument
borrowed
from
malthus
but
this
argument
does
not
prove
it
at
all
we
might
as
well
take
a
number
of
villages
in
russia
the
inhabitants
of
which
enjoy
plenty
of
food
but
have
no
sanitary
accommodation
of
any
kind
and
seeing
that
for
the
last
eighty
years
the
was
sixty
in
the
thousand
while
the
population
is
now
what
it
was
eighty
years
ago
we
might
conclude
that
there
has
been
a
terrible
competition
between
the
inhabitants
but
the
truth
is
that
from
year
to
year
the
population
remained
stationary
for
the
simple
reason
that
of
the
died
before
reaching
their
sixth
month
of
life
died
within
the
next
four
years
and
out
of
each
hundred
born
only
seventeen
or
so
reached
the
age
of
twenty
the
went
away
before
having
grown
to
be
competitors
it
is
evident
that
if
such
is
the
case
with
men
it
is
still
more
the
case
with
animals
in
the
feathered
world
the
destruction
of
the
eggs
goes
on
on
such
a
tremendous
scale
that
eggs
are
the
chief
food
of
several
species
in
the
early
summer
not
to
say
a
word
of
the
storms
the
inundations
which
destroy
nests
by
the
million
in
america
and
the
sudden
changes
of
weather
which
are
fatal
to
the
young
mammals
each
storm
each
inundation
each
visit
of
a
rat
to
a
bird
nest
each
sudden
change
of
temperature
take
away
those
competitors
which
appear
so
terrible
in
theory
as
to
the
facts
of
an
extremely
rapid
increase
of
horses
and
cattle
in
america
of
pigs
and
rabbits
in
new
zealand
and
even
of
wild
animals
imported
from
europe
where
their
numbers
are
kept
down
by
man
not
by
competition
they
rather
seem
opposed
to
the
theory
of
if
horses
and
cattle
could
so
rapidly
multiply
in
america
it
simply
proved
that
however
numberless
the
buffaloes
and
other
ruminants
were
at
that
time
in
the
new
world
its
population
was
far
below
what
the
prairies
could
maintain
if
millions
of
intruders
have
found
plenty
of
food
without
starving
out
the
former
population
of
the
prairies
we
must
rather
conclude
that
the
europeans
found
a
want
of
in
america
not
an
excess
and
we
have
good
reasons
to
believe
that
want
of
animal
population
is
the
natural
state
of
things
all
over
the
world
with
but
a
few
temporary
exceptions
to
the
rule
the
actual
numbers
of
animals
in
a
given
region
are
determined
not
by
the
highest
feeding
capacity
of
the
region
but
by
what
it
is
every
year
under
the
most
unfavourable
conditions
so
that
for
that
reason
alone
competition
hardly
can
be
a
normal
condition
but
other
causes
intervene
as
well
to
cut
down
the
animal
population
below
even
that
low
standard
if
we
take
the
horses
and
cattle
which
are
grazing
all
the
winter
through
in
the
steppes
of
transbaikalia
we
find
them
very
lean
and
exhausted
at
the
end
of
the
winter
but
they
grow
exhausted
not
because
there
is
not
enough
food
for
all
of
them
the
grass
buried
under
a
thin
sheet
of
snow
is
everywhere
in
abundance
but
because
of
the
difficulty
of
getting
it
from
beneath
the
snow
and
this
difficulty
is
the
same
for
all
horses
alike
besides
days
of
glazed
frost
are
common
in
early
spring
and
if
several
such
days
come
in
succession
the
horses
grow
still
more
exhausted
but
then
comes
a
which
compels
the
already
weakened
animals
to
remain
without
any
food
for
several
days
and
very
great
numbers
of
them
die
the
losses
during
the
spring
are
so
severe
that
if
the
season
has
been
more
inclement
than
usual
they
are
even
not
repaired
by
the
new
breeds
the
more
so
as
all
horses
are
exhausted
and
the
young
foals
are
born
in
a
weaker
condition
the
numbers
of
horses
and
cattle
thus
always
remain
beneath
what
they
otherwise
might
be
all
the
year
round
there
is
food
for
five
or
ten
times
as
many
animals
and
yet
their
population
increases
extremely
slowly
but
as
soon
as
the
buriate
owner
makes
ever
so
small
a
provision
of
hay
in
the
steppe
and
throws
it
open
during
days
of
glazed
frost
or
heavier
he
immediately
sees
the
increase
of
his
herd
almost
all
free
animals
and
many
rodents
in
asia
and
america
being
in
very
much
the
same
conditions
we
can
safely
say
that
their
numbers
are
not
kept
down
by
competition
that
at
no
time
of
the
year
they
can
struggle
for
food
and
that
if
they
never
reach
anything
approaching
to
the
cause
is
in
the
climate
not
in
competition
the
importance
of
natural
checks
to
and
especially
their
bearing
upon
the
competition
hypothesis
seems
never
to
have
been
taken
into
due
account
the
checks
or
rather
some
of
them
are
mentioned
but
their
action
is
seldom
studied
in
detail
however
if
we
compare
the
action
of
the
natural
checks
with
that
of
competition
we
must
recognize
at
once
that
the
latter
sustains
no
comparison
whatever
with
the
other
checks
thus
bates
mentions
the
really
astounding
numbers
of
winged
ants
which
are
destroyed
during
their
exodus
the
dead
or
bodies
of
the
formica
de
fuego
myrmica
saevissima
which
had
been
blown
into
the
river
during
a
gale
were
heaped
in
a
line
an
inch
or
two
in
height
and
breadth
the
line
continuing
without
interruption
for
miles
at
the
edge
of
the
water
myriads
of
ants
are
thus
destroyed
amidst
a
nature
which
might
support
a
hundred
times
as
many
ants
as
are
actually
living
altum
a
german
forester
who
wrote
a
very
interesting
book
about
animals
injurious
to
our
forests
also
gives
many
facts
showing
the
immense
importance
of
natural
checks
he
says
that
a
succession
of
gales
or
cold
and
damp
weather
during
the
exodus
of
the
bombyx
pini
destroy
it
to
incredible
amounts
and
during
the
spring
of
all
these
moths
disappeared
at
once
probably
killed
by
a
succession
of
cold
nights
many
like
examples
relative
to
various
insects
could
be
quoted
from
various
parts
of
europe
altum
also
mentions
the
of
the
and
the
immense
amount
of
its
eggs
destroyed
by
foxes
but
he
adds
that
the
parasitic
fungi
which
periodically
infest
it
are
a
far
more
terrible
enemy
than
any
bird
because
they
destroy
the
moth
over
very
large
areas
at
once
as
to
various
species
of
mice
mus
sylvaticus
arvicola
arvalis
and
agrestis
the
same
author
gives
a
long
list
of
their
enemies
but
he
remarks
however
the
most
terrible
enemies
of
mice
are
not
other
animals
but
such
sudden
changes
of
weather
as
occur
almost
every
year
alternations
of
frost
and
warm
weather
destroy
them
in
numberless
quantities
one
single
sudden
change
can
reduce
thousands
of
mice
to
the
number
of
a
few
individuals
on
the
other
side
a
warm
winter
or
a
winter
which
gradually
steps
in
make
them
multiply
in
menacing
proportions
notwithstanding
every
enemy
such
was
the
case
in
and
competition
in
the
case
of
mice
thus
appears
a
quite
trifling
factor
when
compared
with
weather
other
facts
to
the
same
effect
are
also
given
as
regards
squirrels
as
to
birds
it
is
well
known
how
they
suffer
from
sudden
changes
of
weather
late
are
as
destructive
of
on
the
english
moors
as
they
are
in
siberia
and
ch
dixon
saw
the
red
grouse
so
pressed
during
some
exceptionally
severe
winters
that
they
quitted
the
moors
in
numbers
and
we
have
then
known
them
actually
to
be
taken
in
the
streets
of
sheffield
persistent
wet
he
adds
is
almost
as
fatal
to
them
on
the
other
side
the
contagious
diseases
which
continually
visit
most
animal
species
destroy
them
in
such
numbers
that
the
losses
often
can
not
be
repaired
for
many
years
even
with
the
most
animals
thus
some
sixty
years
ago
the
sousliks
suddenly
disappeared
in
the
neighbourhood
of
sarepta
in
russia
in
consequence
of
some
epidemics
and
for
years
no
sousliks
were
seen
in
that
neighbourhood
it
took
many
years
before
they
became
as
numerous
as
they
formerly
were
like
facts
all
tending
to
reduce
the
importance
given
to
competition
could
be
produced
in
numbers
of
course
it
might
be
replied
in
darwin
words
that
nevertheless
each
organic
being
at
some
period
of
its
life
during
some
season
of
the
year
during
each
generation
or
at
intervals
has
to
struggle
for
life
and
to
suffer
great
destruction
and
that
the
fittest
survive
during
such
periods
of
hard
struggle
for
life
but
if
the
evolution
of
the
animal
world
were
based
exclusively
or
even
chiefly
upon
the
survival
of
the
fittest
during
periods
of
calamities
if
natural
selection
were
limited
in
its
action
to
periods
of
exceptional
drought
or
sudden
changes
of
temperature
or
inundations
retrogression
would
be
the
rule
in
the
animal
world
those
who
survive
a
famine
or
a
severe
epidemic
of
cholera
or
or
diphtheria
such
as
we
see
them
in
uncivilized
countries
are
neither
the
strongest
nor
the
healthiest
nor
the
most
intelligent
no
progress
could
be
based
on
those
survivals
the
less
so
as
all
survivors
usually
come
out
of
the
ordeal
with
an
impaired
health
like
the
transbaikalian
horses
just
mentioned
or
the
arctic
crews
or
the
garrison
of
a
fortress
which
has
been
compelled
to
live
for
a
few
months
on
half
rations
and
comes
out
of
its
experience
with
a
broken
health
and
subsequently
shows
a
quite
abnormal
mortality
all
that
natural
selection
can
do
in
times
of
calamities
is
to
spare
the
individuals
endowed
with
the
greatest
endurance
for
privations
of
all
kinds
so
it
does
among
the
siberian
horses
and
cattle
they
are
enduring
they
can
feed
upon
the
polar
birch
in
case
of
need
they
resist
cold
and
hunger
but
no
siberian
horse
is
capable
of
carrying
half
the
weight
which
a
european
horse
carries
with
ease
no
siberian
cow
gives
half
the
amount
of
milk
given
by
a
jersey
cow
and
no
natives
of
uncivilized
countries
can
bear
a
comparison
with
europeans
they
may
better
endure
hunger
and
cold
but
their
physical
force
is
very
far
below
that
of
a
european
and
their
intellectual
progress
is
despairingly
slow
evil
can
not
be
productive
of
good
as
tchernyshevsky
wrote
in
a
remarkable
essay
upon
darwinism
happily
enough
competition
is
not
the
rule
either
in
the
animal
world
or
in
mankind
it
is
limited
among
animals
to
exceptional
periods
and
natural
selection
finds
better
fields
for
its
activity
better
conditions
are
created
by
the
elimination
of
competition
by
means
of
mutual
aid
and
mutual
support
in
the
great
struggle
for
life
for
the
greatest
possible
fulness
and
intensity
of
life
with
the
least
waste
of
energy
natural
selection
continually
seeks
out
the
ways
precisely
for
avoiding
competition
as
much
as
possible
the
ants
combine
in
nests
and
nations
they
pile
up
their
stores
they
rear
their
cattle
and
thus
avoid
competition
and
natural
selection
picks
out
of
the
ants
family
the
species
which
know
best
how
to
avoid
competition
with
its
unavoidably
deleterious
consequences
most
of
our
birds
slowly
move
southwards
as
the
winter
comes
or
gather
in
numberless
societies
and
undertake
long
journeys
and
thus
avoid
competition
many
rodents
fall
asleep
when
the
time
comes
that
competition
should
set
in
while
other
rodents
store
food
for
the
winter
and
gather
in
large
villages
for
obtaining
the
necessary
protection
when
at
work
the
reindeer
when
the
lichens
are
dry
in
the
interior
of
the
continent
migrate
towards
the
sea
buffaloes
cross
an
immense
continent
in
order
to
find
plenty
of
food
and
the
beavers
when
they
grow
numerous
on
a
river
divide
into
two
parties
and
go
the
old
ones
down
the
river
and
the
young
ones
up
the
river
and
avoid
competition
and
when
animals
can
neither
fall
asleep
nor
migrate
nor
lay
in
stores
nor
themselves
grow
their
food
like
the
ants
they
do
what
the
titmouse
does
and
what
wallace
darwinism
ch
v
has
so
charmingly
described
they
resort
to
new
kinds
of
food
and
thus
again
avoid
competition
do
compete
competition
is
always
injurious
to
the
species
and
you
have
plenty
of
resources
to
avoid
it
that
is
the
tendency
of
nature
not
always
realized
in
full
but
always
present
that
is
the
watchword
which
comes
to
us
from
the
bush
the
forest
the
river
the
ocean
therefore
combine
practise
mutual
aid
that
is
the
surest
means
for
giving
to
each
and
to
all
the
greatest
safety
the
best
guarantee
of
existence
and
progress
bodily
intellectual
and
moral
that
is
what
nature
teaches
us
and
that
is
what
all
those
animals
which
have
attained
the
highest
position
in
their
respective
classes
have
done
that
is
also
what
man
the
most
primitive
man
has
been
doing
and
that
is
why
man
has
reached
the
position
upon
which
we
stand
now
as
we
shall
see
in
the
subsequent
chapters
devoted
to
mutual
aid
in
human
societies

it
was

by

as
also

on
the
contrary
prefers
staying
in

themselves
under

as
well
as
in

it
thus
is
much
more
exposed
to
be
exterminated

we
can
not
maintain
with
any
approach
to
certainty
that
the

is
being
either
exterminated

starved
out
by
the

not

it
may
be

find

chapters
we
have
now
to
cast
a
glance
upon
the
part
played
by
the
same
agencies
in
the
evolution
of
mankind
we
saw
how
few
are
the
animal
species
which
live
an
isolated
life
and
how
numberless
are
those
which
live
in
societies
either
for
mutual
defence
or
for
hunting
and
storing
up
food
or
for
rearing
their
offspring
or
simply
for
enjoying
life
in
common
we
also
saw
that
though
a
good
deal
of
warfare
goes
on
between
different
classes
of
animals
or
different
species
or
even
different
tribes
of
the
same
species
peace
and
mutual
support
are
the
rule
within
the
tribe
or
the
species
and
that
those
species
which
best
know
how
to
combine
and
to
avoid
competition
have
the
best
chances
of
survival
and
of
a
further
progressive
development
they
prosper
while
the
unsociable
species
decay
it
is
evident
that
it
would
be
quite
contrary
to
all
that
we
know
of
nature
if
men
were
an
exception
to
so
general
a
rule
if
a
creature
so
defenceless
as
man
was
at
his
beginnings
should
have
found
his
protection
and
his
way
to
progress
not
in
mutual
support
like
other
animals
but
in
a
reckless
competition
for
personal
advantages
with
no
regard
to
the
interests
of
the
species
to
a
mind
accustomed
to
the
idea
of
unity
in
nature
such
a
proposition
appears
utterly
indefensible
and
yet
improbable
and
unphilosophical
as
it
is
it
has
never
found
a
lack
of
supporters
there
always
were
writers
who
took
a
pessimistic
view
of
mankind
they
knew
it
more
or
less
superficially
through
their
own
limited
experience
they
knew
of
history
what
the
annalists
always
watchful
of
wars
cruelty
and
oppression
told
of
it
and
little
more
besides
and
they
concluded
that
mankind
is
nothing
but
a
loose
aggregation
of
beings
always
ready
to
fight
with
each
other
and
only
prevented
from
so
doing
by
the
intervention
of
some
authority
hobbes
took
that
position
and
while
some
of
his
followers
endeavoured
to
prove
that
at
no
epoch
of
its
existence
not
even
in
its
most
primitive
condition
mankind
lived
in
a
state
of
perpetual
warfare
that
men
have
been
sociable
even
in
the
state
of
nature
and
that
want
of
knowledge
rather
than
the
natural
bad
inclinations
of
man
brought
humanity
to
all
the
horrors
of
its
early
historical
life
his
idea
was
on
the
contrary
that
the
state
of
nature
was
nothing
but
a
permanent
fight
between
individuals
accidentally
huddled
together
by
the
mere
caprice
of
their
bestial
existence
true
that
science
has
made
some
progress
since
time
and
that
we
have
safer
ground
to
stand
upon
than
the
speculations
of
hobbes
or
rousseau
but
the
hobbesian
philosophy
has
plenty
of
admirers
still
and
we
have
had
of
late
quite
a
school
of
writers
who
taking
possession
of
darwin
terminology
rather
than
of
his
leading
ideas
made
of
it
an
argument
in
favour
of
hobbes
views
upon
primitive
man
and
even
succeeded
in
giving
them
a
scientific
appearance
huxley
as
is
known
took
the
lead
of
that
school
and
in
a
paper
written
in
he
represented
primitive
men
as
a
sort
of
tigers
or
lions
deprived
of
all
ethical
conceptions
fighting
out
the
struggle
for
existence
to
its
bitter
end
and
living
a
life
of
continual
free
fight
to
quote
his
own
words
beyond
the
limited
and
temporary
relations
of
the
family
the
hobbesian
war
of
each
against
all
was
the
normal
state
of
existence
it
has
been
remarked
more
than
once
that
the
chief
error
of
hobbes
and
the
philosophers
as
well
was
to
imagine
that
mankind
began
its
life
in
the
shape
of
small
straggling
families
something
like
the
limited
and
temporary
families
of
the
bigger
carnivores
while
in
reality
it
is
now
positively
known
that
such
was
not
the
case
of
course
we
have
no
direct
evidence
as
to
the
modes
of
life
of
the
first
beings
we
are
not
yet
settled
even
as
to
the
time
of
their
first
appearance
geologists
being
inclined
at
present
to
see
their
traces
in
the
pliocene
or
even
the
miocene
deposits
of
the
tertiary
period
but
we
have
the
indirect
method
which
permits
us
to
throw
some
light
even
upon
that
remote
antiquity
a
most
careful
investigation
into
the
social
institutions
of
the
lowest
races
has
been
carried
on
during
the
last
forty
years
and
it
has
revealed
among
the
present
institutions
of
primitive
folk
some
traces
of
still
older
institutions
which
have
long
disappeared
but
nevertheless
left
unmistakable
traces
of
their
previous
existence
a
whole
science
devoted
to
the
embryology
of
human
institutions
has
thus
developed
in
the
hands
of
bachofen
maclennan
morgan
edwin
tylor
maine
post
kovalevsky
lubbock
and
many
others
and
that
science
has
established
beyond
any
doubt
that
mankind
did
not
begin
its
life
in
the
shape
of
small
isolated
families
far
from
being
a
primitive
form
of
organization
the
family
is
a
very
late
product
of
human
evolution
as
far
as
we
can
go
back
in
the
of
mankind
we
find
men
living
in
societies
in
tribes
similar
to
those
of
the
highest
mammals
and
an
extremely
slow
and
long
evolution
was
required
to
bring
these
societies
to
the
gentile
or
clan
organization
which
in
its
turn
had
to
undergo
another
also
very
long
evolution
before
the
first
germs
of
family
polygamous
or
monogamous
could
appear
societies
bands
or
tribes
not
families
were
thus
the
primitive
form
of
organization
of
mankind
and
its
earliest
ancestors
that
is
what
ethnology
has
come
to
after
its
painstaking
researches
and
in
so
doing
it
simply
came
to
what
might
have
been
foreseen
by
the
zoologist
none
of
the
higher
mammals
save
a
few
carnivores
and
a
few
species
of
apes
and
gorillas
live
in
small
families
isolatedly
straggling
in
the
woods
all
others
live
in
societies
and
darwin
so
well
understood
that
apes
never
could
have
developed
into
beings
that
he
was
inclined
to
consider
man
as
descended
from
some
comparatively
weak
but
social
species
like
the
chimpanzee
rather
than
from
some
stronger
but
unsociable
species
like
the
gorilla
zoology
and
are
thus
agreed
in
considering
that
the
band
not
the
family
was
the
earliest
form
of
social
life
the
first
human
societies
simply
were
a
further
development
of
those
societies
which
constitute
the
very
essence
of
life
of
the
higher
animals
if
we
now
go
over
to
positive
evidence
we
see
that
the
earliest
traces
of
man
dating
from
the
glacial
or
the
early
period
afford
unmistakable
proofs
of
man
having
lived
even
then
in
societies
isolated
finds
of
stone
implements
even
from
the
old

age

the
contrary
wherever
one
flint
implement
is
discovered
others
are
sure
to
be
found
in
most
cases
in
very
large
quantities
at
a
time
when
men
were
dwelling
in
caves
or
under
occasionally
protruding
rocks
in
company
with
mammals
now
extinct
and
hardly
succeeded
in
making
the
roughest
sorts
of
flint
hatchets
they
already
knew
the
advantages
of
life
in
societies
in
the
valleys
of
the
tributaries
of
the
dordogne
the
surface
of
the
rocks
is
in
some
places
entirely
covered
with
caves
which
were
inhabited
by
palaeolithic
men
sometimes
the
are
superposed
in
storeys
and
they
certainly
recall
much
more
the
nesting
colonies
of
swallows
than
the
dens
of
carnivores
as
to
the
flint
implements
discovered
in
those
caves
to
use
lubbock
words
one
may
say
without
exaggeration
that
they
are
numberless
the
same
is
true
of
other
palaeolithic
stations
it
also
appears
from
investigations
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
aurignac
region
in
the
south
of
france
partook
of
tribal
meals
at
the
burial
of
their
dead
so
that
men
lived
in
societies
and
had
germs
of
a
tribal
worship
even
at
that
extremely
remote
epoch
the
same
is
still
better
proved
as
regards
the
later
part
of
the
stone
age
traces
of
neolithic
man
have
been
found
in
numberless
quantities
so
that
we
can
reconstitute
his
manner
of
life
to
a
great
extent
when
the
which
must
have
spread
from
the
polar
regions
as
far
south
as
middle
france
middle
germany
and
middle
russia
and
covered
canada
as
well
as
a
good
deal
of
what
is
now
the
united
states
began
to
melt
away
the
surfaces
freed
from
ice
were
covered
first
with
swamps
and
marshes
and
later
on
with
numberless
lakes
lakes
filled
all
depressions
of
the
valleys
before
their
waters
dug
out
those
permanent
channels
which
during
a
subsequent
epoch
became
our
rivers
and
wherever
we
explore
in
europe
asia
or
america
the
shores
of
the
literally
numberless
lakes
of
that
period
whose
proper
name
would
be
the
lacustrine
period
we
find
traces
of
neolithic
man
they
are
so
numerous
that
we
can
only
wonder
at
the
relative
density
of
population
at
that
time
the
stations
of
neolithic
man
closely
follow
each
other
on
the
terraces
which
now
mark
the
shores
of
the
old
lakes
and
at
each
of
those
stations
stone
implements
appear
in
such
numbers
that
no
doubt
is
possible
as
to
the
length
of
time
during
which
they
were
inhabited
by
rather
numerous
tribes
whole
workshops
of
flint
implements
testifying
of
the
numbers
of
workers
who
used
to
come
together
have
been
discovered
by
the
archaeologists
traces
of
a
more
advanced
period
already
characterized
by
the
use
of
some
pottery
are
found
in
the
of
denmark
they
appear
as
is
well
known
in
the
shape
of
heaps
from
five
to
ten
feet
thick
from
to
feet
wide
and
feet
or
more
in
length
and
they
are
so
common
along
some
parts
of
the
that
for
a
long
time
they
were
considered
as
natural
growths
and
yet
they
contain
nothing
but
what
has
been
in
some
way
or
other
subservient
to
the
use
of
man
and
they
are
so
densely
stuffed
with
products
of
human
industry
that
during
a
two
days
stay
at
milgaard
lubbock
dug
out
no
less
than
pieces
of
and
four
fragments
of
pottery
the
very
size
and
extension
of
the
shell
heaps
prove
that
for
generations
and
generations
the
coasts
of
denmark
were
inhabited
by
hundreds
of
small
tribes
which
certainly
lived
as
peacefully
together
as
the
fuegian
tribes
which
also
accumulate
like
shellheaps
are
living
in
our
own
times
as
to
the
of
switzerland
which
represent
a
still
further
advance
in
civilization
they
yield
still
better
evidence
of
life
and
work
in
societies
it
is
known
that
even
during
the
stone
age
the
shores
of
the
swiss
lakes
were
dotted
with
a
succession
of
villages
each
of
which
consisted
of
several
huts
and
was
built
upon
a
platform
supported
by
numberless
pillars
in
the
lake
no
less
than
mostly
stone
age
villages
were
discovered
along
the
shores
of
lake
leman
in
the
lake
of
constance
in
the
lake
of
neuchatel
and
so
on
and
each
of
them
testifies
to
the
immense
amount
of
labour
which
was
spent
in
common
by
the
tribe
not
by
the
family
it
has
even
been
asserted
that
the
life
of
the
must
have
been
remarkably
free
of
warfare
and
so
it
probably
was
especially
if
we
refer
to
the
life
of
those
primitive
folk
who
live
until
the
present
time
in
similar
villages
built
upon
pillars
on
the
sea
coasts
it
is
thus
seen
even
from
the
above
rapid
hints
that
our
knowledge
of
primitive
man
is
not
so
scanty
after
all
and
that
so
far
as
it
goes
it
is
rather
opposed
than
favourable
to
the
hobbesian
speculations
moreover
it
may
be
supplemented
to
a
great
extent
by
the
direct
observation
of
such
primitive
tribes
as
now
stand
on
the
same
level
of
civilization
as
the
inhabitants
of
europe
stood
in
prehistoric
times
that
these
primitive
tribes
which
we
find
now
are
not
degenerated
specimens
of
mankind
who
formerly
knew
a
higher
civilization
as
it
has
occasionally
been
maintained
has
sufficiently
been
proved
by
edwin
tylor
and
lubbock
however
to
the
arguments
already
opposed
to
the
degeneration
theory
the
following
may
be
added
save
a
few
tribes
clustering
in
the
highlands
the
savages
represent
a
girdle
which
encircles
the
more
or
less
civilized
nations
and
they
occupy
the
extremities
of
our
continents
most
of
which
have
retained
still
or
recently
were
bearing
an
early
character
such
are
the
eskimos
and
their
congeners
in
greenland
arctic
america
and
northern
siberia
and
in
the
southern
hemisphere
the
australians
the
papuas
the
fuegians
and
partly
the
bushmen
while
within
the
civilized
area
like
primitive
folk
are
only
found
in
the
himalayas
the
highlands
of
australasia
and
the
plateaus
of
brazil
now
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
glacial
age
did
not
come
to
an
end
at
once
over
the
whole
surface
of
the
earth
it
still
continues
in
greenland
therefore
at
a
time
when
the
littoral
regions
of
the
indian
ocean
the
mediterranean
or
the
gulf
of
mexico
already
enjoyed
a
warmer
climate
and
became
the
seats
of
higher
civilizations
immense
territories
in
middle
europe
siberia
and
northern
america
as
well
as
in
patagonia
southern
africa
and
southern
australasia
remained
in
early
postglacial
conditions
which
rendered
them
inaccessible
to
the
civilized
nations
of
the
torrid
and
zones
they
were
at
that
time
what
the
terrible
urmans
of
siberia
are
now
and
their
population
inaccessible
to
and
untouched
by
civilization
retained
the
characters
of
early
man
later
on
when
desiccation
rendered
these
territories
more
suitable
for
agriculture
they
were
peopled
with
more
civilized
immigrants
and
while
part
of
their
previous
inhabitants
were
assimilated
by
the
new
settlers
another
part
migrated
further
and
settled
where
we
find
them
the
territories
they
inhabit
now
are
still
or
recently
were
as
to
their
physical
features
their
arts
and
implements
are
those
of
the
neolithic
age
and
notwithstanding
their
racial
differences
and
the
distances
which
separate
them
their
modes
of
life
and
social
institutions
bear
a
striking
likeness
so
we
can
not
but
consider
them
as
fragments
of
the
early
population
of
the
now
civilized
area
the
first
thing
which
strikes
us
as
soon
as
we
begin
studying
primitive
folk
is
the
complexity
of
the
organization
of
marriage
relations
under
which
they
are
living
with
most
of
them
the
family
in
the
sense
we
attribute
to
it
is
hardly
found
in
its
germs
but
they
are
by
no
means
loose
aggregations
of
men
and
women
coming
in
a
disorderly
manner
together
in
conformity
with
their
momentary
caprices
all
of
them
are
under
a
certain
organization
which
has
been
described
by
morgan
in
its
general
aspects
as
the
gentile
or
clan
organization
to
tell
the
matter
as
briefly
as
possible
there
is
little
doubt
that
mankind
has
passed
at
its
beginnings
through
a
stage
which
may
be
described
as
that
of
communal
marriage
that
is
the
whole
tribe
had
husbands
and
wives
in
common
with
but
little
regard
to
consanguinity
but
it
is
also
certain
that
some
restrictions
to
that
free
intercourse
were
imposed
at
a
very
early
period
was
soon
prohibited
between
the
sons
of
one
mother
and
her
sisters
granddaughters
and
aunts
later
on
it
was
prohibited
between
the
sons
and
daughters
of
the
same
mother
and
further
limitations
did
not
fail
to
follow
the
idea
of
a
gens
or
clan
which
embodied
all
presumed
descendants
from
one
stock
or
rather
all
those
who
gathered
in
one
group
was
evolved
and
marriage
within
the
clan
was
entirely
prohibited
it
still
remained
communal
but
the
wife
or
the
husband
had
to
be
taken
from
another
clan
and
when
a
gens
became
too
numerous
and
subdivided
into
several
gentes
each
of
them
was
divided
into
classes
usually
four
and
marriage
was
permitted
only
between
certain
classes
that
is
the
stage
which
we
find
now
among
the
australians
as
to
the
family
its
first
germs
appeared
amidst
the
clan
organization
a
woman
who
was
captured
in
war
from
some
other
clan
and
who
formerly
would
have
belonged
to
the
whole
gens
could
be
kept
at
a
later
period
by
the
capturer
under
certain
obligations
towards
the
tribe
she
may
be
taken
by
him
to
a
separate
hut
after
she
had
paid
a
certain
tribute
to
the
clan
and
thus
constitute
within
the
gens
a
separate
family
the
appearance
of
which
evidently
was
opening
a
quite
new
phase
of
civilization
now
if
we
take
into
consideration
that
this
complicated
organization
developed
among
men
who
stood
at
the
lowest
known
degree
of
development
and
that
it
maintained
itself
in
societies
knowing
no
kind
of
authority
besides
the
authority
of
public
opinion
we
at
once
see
how
deeply
inrooted
social
instincts
must
have
been
in
human
nature
even
at
its
lowest
stages
a
savage
who
is
capable
of
living
under
such
an
organization
and
of
freely
submitting
to
rules
which
continually
clash
with
his
personal
desires
certainly
is
not
a
beast
devoid
of
ethical
principles
and
knowing
no
rein
to
its
passions
but
the
fact
becomes
still
more
striking
if
we
consider
the
immense
antiquity
of
the
clan
organization
it
is
now
known
that
the
primitive
semites
the
greeks
of
homer
the
prehistoric
romans
the
germans
of
tacitus
the
early
celts
and
the
early
slavonians
all
have
had
their
own
period
of
clan
organization
closely
analogous
to
that
of
the
australians
the
red
indians
the
eskimos
and
other
inhabitants
of
the
savage
girdle
so
we
must
admit
that
either
the
evolution
of
marriage
laws
went
on
on
the
same
lines
among
all
human
races
or
the
rudiments
of
the
clan
rules
were
developed
among
some
common
ancestors
of
the
semites
the
aryans
the
polynesians
before
their
differentiation
into
separate
races
took
place
and
that
these
rules
were
maintained
until
now
among
races
long
ago
separated
from
the
common
stock
both
alternatives
imply
however
an
equally
striking
tenacity
of
the
institution
such
a
tenacity
that
no
assaults
of
the
individual
could
break
it
down
through
the
scores
of
thousands
of
years
that
it
was
in
existence
the
very
persistence
of
the
clan
organization
shows
how
utterly
false
it
is
to
represent
primitive
mankind
as
a
disorderly
agglomeration
of
individuals
who
only
obey
their
individual
passions
and
take
advantage
of
their
personal
force
and
cunningness
against
all
other
representatives
of
the
species
unbridled
individualism
is
a
modern
growth
but
it
is
not
characteristic
of
primitive
mankind
going
now
over
to
the
existing
savages
we
may
begin
with
the
bushmen
who
stand
at
a
very
low
level
of
development
so
low
indeed
that
they
have
no
dwellings
and
sleep
in
holes
dug
in
the
soil
occasionally
protected
by
some
screens
it
is
known
that
when
europeans
settled
in
their
territory
and
destroyed
deer
the
bushmen
began
stealing
the
settlers
cattle
whereupon
a
war
of
extermination
too
horrible
to
be
related
here
was
waged
against
them
five
hundred
bushmen
were
slaughtered
in
three
thousand
in
and
by
the
alliance
and
so
on
they
were
poisoned
like
rats
killed
by
hunters
lying
in
ambush
before
the
carcass
of
some
animal
killed
wherever
met
with
so
that
our
knowledge
of
the
bushmen
being
chiefly
borrowed
from
those
same
people
who
exterminated
them
is
necessarily
limited
but
still
we
know
that
when
the
europeans
came
the
bushmen
lived
in
small
tribes
or
clans
sometimes
federated
together
that
they
used
to
hunt
in
common
and
divided
the
spoil
without
quarrelling
that
they
never
abandoned
their
wounded
and
displayed
strong
affection
to
their
comrades
lichtenstein
has
a
most
touching
story
about
a
bushman
nearly
drowned
in
a
river
who
was
rescued
by
his
companions
they
took
off
their
furs
to
cover
him
and
shivered
themselves
they
dried
him
rubbed
him
before
the
fire
and
smeared
his
body
with
warm
grease
till
they
brought
him
back
to
life
and
when
the
bushmen
found
in
johan
van
der
walt
a
man
who
treated
them
well
they
expressed
their
thankfulness
by
a
most
touching
attachment
to
that
man
burchell
and
moffat
both
represent
them
as
goodhearted
disinterested
true
to
their
promises
and
grateful
all
qualities
which
could
develop
only
by
being
practised
within
the
tribe
as
to
their
love
to
children
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
when
a
european
wished
to
secure
a
bushman
woman
as
a
slave
he
stole
her
child
the
mother
was
sure
to
come
into
slavery
to
share
the
fate
of
her
child
the
same
social
manners
characterize
the
hottentots
who
are
but
a
little
more
developed
than
the
bushmen
lubbock
describes
them
as
the
filthiest
animals
and
filthy
they
really
are
a
fur
suspended
to
the
neck
and
worn
till
it
falls
to
pieces
is
all
their
dress
their
huts
are
a
few
sticks
assembled
together
and
covered
with
mats
with
no
kind
of
furniture
within
and
though
they
kept
oxen
and
sheep
and
seem
to
have
known
the
use
of
iron
before
they
made
acquaintance
with
the
europeans
they
still
occupy
one
of
the
lowest
degrees
of
the
human
scale
and
yet
those
who
knew
them
highly
praised
their
sociability
and
readiness
to
aid
each
other
if
anything
is
given
to
a
hottentot
he
at
once
divides
it
among
all
present
a
habit
which
as
is
known
so
much
struck
darwin
among
the
fuegians
he
can
not
eat
alone
and
however
hungry
he
calls
those
who
pass
by
to
share
his
food
and
when
kolben
expressed
his
astonishment
thereat
he
received
the
answer
that
is
hottentot
manner
but
this
is
not
hottentot
manner
only
it
is
an
all
but
universal
habit
among
the
savages
kolben
who
knew
the
hottentots
well
and
did
not
pass
by
their
defects
in
silence
could
not
praise
their
tribal
morality
highly
enough
their
word
is
sacred
he
wrote
they
know
nothing
of
the
corruptness
and
faithless
arts
of
europe
they
live
in
great
tranquillity
and
are
seldom
at
war
with
their
neighbours
they
are
all
kindness
and
goodwill
to
one
one
of
the
greatest
pleasures
of
the
hottentots
certainly
lies
in
their
gifts
and
good
offices
to
one
another
the
integrity
of
the
hottentots
their
strictness
and
celerity
in
the
exercise
of
justice
and
their
chastity
are
things
in
which
they
excel
all
or
most
nations
in
the
world
tachart
barrow
and
moodie
fully
confirm
kolben
testimony
let
me
only
remark
that
when
kolben
wrote
that
they
are
certainly
the
most
friendly
the
most
liberal
and
the
most
benevolent
people
to
one
another
that
ever
appeared
on
the
earth
i
he
wrote
a
sentence
which
has
continually
appeared
since
in
the
description
of
savages
when
first
meeting
with
primitive
races
the
europeans
usually
make
a
caricature
of
their
life
but
when
an
intelligent
man
has
stayed
among
them
for
a
longer
time
he
generally
describes
them
as
the
kindest
or
the
gentlest
race
on
the
earth
these
very
same
words
have
been
applied
to
the
ostyaks
the
samoyedes
the
eskimos
the
dayaks
the
aleoutes
the
papuas
and
so
on
by
the
highest
authorities
i
also
remember
having
read
them
applied
to
the
tunguses
the
tchuktchis
the
sioux
and
several
others
the
very
frequency
of
that
high
commendation
already
speaks
volumes
in
itself
the
natives
of
australia
do
not
stand
on
a
higher
level
of
development
than
their
south
african
brothers
their
huts
are
of
the
same
character
very
often
simple
screens
are
the
only
protection
against
cold
winds
in
their
food
they
are
most
indifferent
they
devour
horribly
putrefied
corpses
and
cannibalism
is
resorted
to
in
times
of
scarcity
when
first
discovered
by
europeans
they
had
no
implements
but
in
stone
or
bone
and
these
were
of
the
roughest
description
some
tribes
had
even
no
canoes
and
did
not
know
and
yet
when
their
manners
and
customs
were
carefully
studied
they
proved
to
be
living
under
that
elaborate
clan
organization
which
i
have
mentioned
on
a
preceding
page
the
territory
they
inhabit
is
usually
allotted
between
the
different
gentes
or
clans
but
the
hunting
and
fishing
territories
of
each
clan
are
kept
in
common
and
the
produce
of
fishing
and
hunting
belongs
to
the
whole
clan
so
also
the
fishing
and
hunting
implements
the
meals
are
taken
in
common
like
many
other
savages
they
respect
certain
regulations
as
to
the
seasons
when
certain
gums
and
grasses
may
be
collected
as
to
their
morality
altogether
we
can
not
do
better
than
transcribe
the
following
answers
given
to
the
questions
of
the
paris
anthropological
society
by
lumholtz
a
missionary
who
sojourned
in
north
queensland
the
feeling
of
friendship
is
known
among
them
it
is
strong
weak
people
are
usually
supported
sick
people
are
very
well
attended
to
they
never
are
abandoned
or
killed
these
tribes
are
cannibals
but
they
very
seldom
eat
members
of
their
own
tribe
when
immolated
on
religious
principles
i
suppose
they
eat
strangers
only
the
parents
love
their
children
play
with
them
and
pet
them
infanticide
meets
with
common
approval
old
people
are
very
well
treated
never
put
to
death
no
religion
no
idols
only
a
fear
of
death
polygamous
marriage
quarrels
arising
within
the
tribe
are
settled
by
means
of
duels
fought
with
wooden
swords
and
shields
no
slaves
no
culture
of
any
kind
no
pottery
no
dress
save
an
apron
sometimes
worn
by
women
the
clan
consists
of
two
hundred
individuals
divided
into
four
classes
of
men
and
four
of
women
marriage
being
only
permitted
within
the
usual
classes
and
never
within
the
gens
for
the
papuas
closely
akin
to
the
above
we
have
the
testimony
of
bink
who
stayed
in
new
guinea
chiefly
in
geelwink
bay
from
to
here
is
the
essence
of
his
answers
to
the
same
questioner
they
are
sociable
and
cheerful
they
laugh
very
much
rather
timid
than
courageous
friendship
is
relatively
strong
among
persons
belonging
to
different
tribes
and
still
stronger
within
the
tribe
a
friend
will
often
pay
the
debt
of
his
friend
the
stipulation
being
that
the
latter
will
repay
it
without
interest
to
the
children
of
the
lender
they
take
care
of
the
ill
and
the
old
old
people
are
never
abandoned
and
in
no
case
are
they
killed
unless
it
be
a
slave
who
was
ill
for
a
long
time
war
prisoners
are
sometimes
eaten
the
children
are
very
much
petted
and
loved
old
and
feeble
war
prisoners
are
killed
the
others
are
sold
as
slaves
they
have
no
religion
no
gods
no
idols
no
authority
of
any
description
the
oldest
man
in
the
family
is
the
judge
in
cases
of
adultery
a
fine
is
paid
and
part
of
it
goes
to
the
negoria
the
community
the
soil
is
kept
in
common
but
the
crop
belongs
to
those
who
have
grown
it
they
have
pottery
and
know
the
custom
being
that
the
merchant
gives
them
the
goods
whereupon
they
return
to
their
houses
and
bring
the
native
goods
required
by
the
merchant
if
the
latter
can
not
be
obtained
the
european
goods
are
returned
they
are
and
in
so
doing
they
prosecute
blood
revenge
finsch
says
affair
is
referred
to
the
rajah
of
namototte
who
terminates
it
by
imposing
a
fine
when
well
treated
the
papuas
are
very
kind
landed
on
the
eastern
coast
of
new
guinea
followed
by
one
single
man
stayed
for
two
years
among
tribes
reported
to
be
cannibals
and
left
them
with
regret
he
returned
again
to
stay
one
year
more
among
them
and
never
had
he
any
conflict
to
complain
of
true
that
his
rule
was
never
under
no
pretext
whatever
to
say
anything
which
was
not
truth
nor
make
any
promise
which
he
could
not
keep
these
poor
creatures
who
even
do
not
know
how
to
obtain
fire
and
carefully
maintain
it
in
their
huts
live
under
their
primitive
communism
without
any
chiefs
and
within
their
villages
they
have
no
quarrels
worth
speaking
of
they
work
in
common
just
enough
to
get
the
food
of
the
day
they
rear
their
children
in
common
and
in
the
evenings
they
dress
themselves
as
coquettishly
as
they
can
and
dance
like
all
savages
they
are
fond
of
dancing
each
village
has
its
barla
or
balai
the
long
house
longue
maison
or
grande
maison
for
the
unmarried
men
for
social
gatherings
and
for
the
discussion
of
common
affairs
again
a
trait
which
is
common
to
most
inhabitants
of
the
pacific
islands
the
eskimos
the
red
indians
and
so
on
whole
groups
of
villages
are
on
friendly
terms
and
visit
each
other
en
bloc
unhappily
feuds
are
not
uncommon
not
in
consequence
of
overstocking
of
the
area
or
keen
competition
and
like
inventions
of
a
mercantile
century
but
chiefly
in
consequence
of
superstition
as
soon
as
any
one
falls
ill
his
friends
and
relatives
come
together
and
deliberately
discuss
who
might
be
the
cause
of
the
illness
all
possible
enemies
are
considered
every
one
confesses
of
his
own
petty
quarrels
and
finally
the
real
cause
is
discovered
an
enemy
from
the
next
village
has
called
it
down
and
a
raid
upon
that
village
is
decided
upon
therefore
feuds
are
rather
frequent
even
between
the
coast
villages
not
to
say
a
word
of
the
cannibal
mountaineers
who
are
considered
as
real
witches
and
enemies
though
on
a
closer
acquaintance
they
prove
to
be
exactly
the
same
sort
of
people
as
their
neighbours
on
the
seacoast
many
striking
pages
could
be
written
about
the
harmony
which
prevails
in
the
villages
of
the
polynesian
inhabitants
of
the
pacific
islands
but
they
belong
to
a
more
advanced
stage
of
civilization
so
we
shall
now
take
our
illustrations
from
the
far
north
i
must
mention
however
before
leaving
the
southern
hemisphere
that
even
the
fuegians
whose
reputation
has
been
so
bad
appear
under
a
much
better
light
since
they
begin
to
be
better
known
a
few
french
missionaries
who
stay
among
them
know
of
no
act
of
malevolence
to
complain
of
in
their
clans
consisting
of
from
to
souls
they
practise
the
same
primitive
communism
as
the
papuas
they
share
everything
in
common
and
treat
their
old
people
very
well
peace
prevails
among
these
tribes
with
the
eskimos
and
their
nearest
congeners
the
thlinkets
the
koloshes
and
the
aleoutes
we
find
one
of
the
nearest
illustrations
of
what
man
may
have
been
during
the
glacial
age
their
implements
hardly
differ
from
those
of
palaeolithic
man
and
some
of
their
tribes
do
not
yet
know
fishing
they
simply
spear
the
fish
with
a
kind
of
harpoon
they
know
the
use
of
iron
but
they
receive
it
from
the
europeans
or
find
it
on
wrecked
ships
their
social
organization
is
of
a
very
primitive
kind
though
they
already
have
emerged
from
the
stage
of
communal
marriage
even
under
the
gentile
restrictions
they
live
in
families
but
the
family
bonds
are
often
broken
husbands
and
wives
are
often
exchanged
the
families
however
remain
united
in
clans
and
how
could
it
be
otherwise
how
could
they
sustain
the
hard
struggle
for
life
unless
by
closely
combining
their
forces
so
they
do
and
the
tribal
bonds
are
closest
where
the
struggle
for
life
is
hardest
namely
in
greenland
the
long
house
is
their
usual
dwelling
and
several
families
lodge
in
it
separated
from
each
other
by
small
partitions
of
ragged
furs
with
a
common
passage
in
the
front
sometimes
the
house
has
the
shape
of
a
cross
and
in
such
case
a
common
fire
is
kept
in
the
centre
the
german
expedition
which
spent
a
winter
close
by
one
of
those
long
houses
could
ascertain
that
no
quarrel
disturbed
the
peace
no
dispute
arose
about
the
use
of
this
narrow
space
throughout
the
long
winter
scolding
or
even
unkind
words
are
considered
as
a
misdemeanour
if
not
produced
under
the
legal
form
of
process
namely
the
close
cohabitation
and
close
interdependence
are
sufficient
for
maintaining
century
after
century
that
deep
respect
for
the
interests
of
the
community
which
is
characteristic
of
eskimo
life
even
in
the
larger
communities
of
eskimos
public
opinion
formed
the
real
the
general
punishment
consisting
in
the
offenders
being
shamed
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
eskimo
life
is
based
upon
communism
what
is
obtained
by
hunting
and
fishing
belongs
to
the
clan
but
in
several
tribes
especially
in
the
west
under
the
influence
of
the
danes
private
property
penetrates
into
their
institutions
however
they
have
an
original
means
for
obviating
the
inconveniences
arising
from
a
personal
accumulation
of
wealth
which
would
soon
destroy
their
tribal
unity
when
a
man
has
grown
rich
he
convokes
the
folk
of
his
clan
to
a
great
festival
and
after
much
eating
distributes
among
them
all
his
fortune
on
the
yukon
river
dall
saw
an
aleonte
family
distributing
in
this
way
ten
guns
ten
full
fur
dresses
strings
of
beads
numerous
blankets
ten
wolf
furs
beavers
and
zibelines
after
that
they
took
off
their
festival
dresses
gave
them
away
and
putting
on
old
ragged
furs
addressed
a
few
words
to
their
kinsfolk
saying
that
though
they
are
now
poorer
than
any
one
of
them
they
have
won
their
friendship
like
distributions
of
wealth
appear
to
be
a
regular
habit
with
the
eskimos
and
to
take
place
at
a
certain
season
after
an
exhibition
of
all
that
has
been
obtained
during
the
year
in
my
opinion
these
distributions
reveal
a
very
old
institution
contemporaneous
with
the
first
apparition
of
personal
wealth
they
must
have
been
a
means
for
equality
among
the
members
of
the
clan
after
it
had
been
disturbed
by
the
enrichment
of
the
few
the
periodical
redistribution
of
land
and
the
periodical
abandonment
of
all
debts
which
took
place
in
historical
times
with
so
many
different
races
semites
aryans
etc
must
have
been
a
survival
of
that
old
custom
and
the
habit
of
either
burying
with
the
dead
or
destroying
upon
his
grave
all
that
belonged
to
him
personally
a
habit
which
we
find
among
all
primitive
races
must
have
had
the
same
origin
in
fact
while
everything
that
belongs
personally
to
the
dead
is
burnt
or
broken
upon
his
grave
nothing
is
destroyed
of
what
belonged
to
him
in
common
with
the
tribe
such
as
boats
or
the
communal
implements
of
fishing
the
destruction
bears
upon
personal
property
alone
at
a
later
epoch
this
habit
becomes
a
religious
ceremony
it
receives
a
mystical
interpretation
and
is
imposed
by
religion
when
public
opinion
alone
proves
incapable
of
enforcing
its
general
observance
and
finally
it
is
substituted
by
either
burning
simple
models
of
the
dead
man
property
as
in
china
or
by
simply
carrying
his
property
to
the
grave
and
taking
it
back
to
his
house
after
the
burial
ceremony
is
over
a
habit
which
still
prevails
with
the
europeans
as
regards
swords
crosses
and
other
marks
of
public
distinction
the
high
standard
of
the
tribal
morality
of
the
eskimos
has
often
been
mentioned
in
general
literature
nevertheless
the
following
remarks
upon
the
manners
of
the
aleoutes
nearly
akin
to
the
eskimos
will
better
illustrate
savage
morality
as
a
whole
they
were
written
after
a
ten
years
stay
among
the
aleoutes
by
a
most
remarkable
man
the
russian
missionary
veniaminoff
i
sum
them
up
mostly
in
his
own
words
endurability
he
wrote
is
their
chief
feature
it
is
simply
colossal
not
only
do
they
bathe
every
morning
in
the
frozen
sea
and
stand
naked
on
the
beach
inhaling
the
icy
wind
but
their
endurability
even
when
at
hard
work
on
insufficient
food
surpasses
all
that
can
be
imagined
during
a
protracted
scarcity
of
food
the
aleoute
cares
first
for
his
children
he
gives
them
all
he
has
and
himself
fasts
they
are
not
inclined
to
stealing
that
was
remarked
even
by
the
first
russian
immigrants
not
that
they
never
steal
every
aleoute
would
confess
having
sometime
stolen
something
but
it
is
always
a
trifle
the
whole
is
so
childish
the
attachment
of
the
parents
to
their
children
is
touching
though
it
is
never
expressed
in
words
or
pettings
the
aleoute
is
with
difficulty
moved
to
make
a
promise
but
once
he
has
made
it
he
will
keep
it
whatever
may
happen
an
aleoute
made
veniaminoff
a
gift
of
dried
fish
but
it
was
forgotten
on
the
beach
in
the
hurry
of
the
departure
he
took
it
home
the
next
occasion
to
send
it
to
the
missionary
was
in
january
and
in
november
and
december
there
was
a
great
scarcity
of
food
in
the
aleoute
encampment
but
the
fish
was
never
touched
by
the
starving
people
and
in
january
it
was
sent
to
its
destination
their
code
of
morality
is
both
varied
and
severe
it
is
considered
shameful
to
be
afraid
of
unavoidable
death
to
ask
pardon
from
an
enemy
to
die
without
ever
having
killed
an
enemy
to
be
convicted
of
stealing
to
capsize
a
boat
in
the
harbour
to
be
afraid
of
going
to
sea
in
stormy
weather
to
be
the
first
in
a
party
on
a
long
journey
to
become
an
invalid
in
case
of
scarcity
of
food
to
show
greediness
when
spoil
is
divided
in
which
case
every
one
gives
his
own
part
to
the
greedy
man
to
shame
him
to
divulge
a
public
secret
to
his
wife
being
two
persons
on
a
hunting
expedition
not
to
offer
the
best
game
to
the
partner
to
boast
of
his
own
deeds
especially
of
invented
ones
to
scold
any
one
in
scorn
also
to
beg
to
pet
his
wife
in
other
people
presence
and
to
dance
with
her
to
bargain
personally
selling
must
always
be
made
through
a
third
person
who
settles
the
price
for
a
woman
it
is
a
shame
not
to
know
sewing
dancing
and
all
kinds
of
work
to
pet
her
husband
and
children
or
even
to
speak
to
her
husband
in
the
presence
of
a
stranger
such
is
aleoute
morality
which
might
also
be
further
illustrated
by
their
tales
and
legends
let
me
also
add
that
when
veniaminoff
wrote
in
one
murder
only
had
been
committed
since
the
last
century
in
a
population
of
people
and
that
among
aleoutes
not
one
single
common
law
offence
had
been
known
for
forty
years
this
will
not
seem
strange
if
we
remark
that
scolding
scorning
and
the
use
of
rough
words
are
absolutely
unknown
in
aleoute
life
even
their
children
never
fight
and
never
abuse
each
other
in
words
all
they
may
say
is
your
mother
does
not
know
sewing
or
your
father
is
blind
of
one
eye
many
features
of
savage
life
remain
however
a
puzzle
to
europeans
the
high
development
of
tribal
solidarity
and
the
good
feelings
with
which
primitive
folk
are
animated
towards
each
other
could
be
illustrated
by
any
amount
of
reliable
testimony
and
yet
it
is
not
the
less
certain
that
those
same
savages
practise
infanticide
that
in
some
cases
they
abandon
their
old
people
and
that
they
blindly
obey
the
rules
of
we
must
then
explain
the
coexistence
of
facts
which
to
the
european
mind
seem
so
contradictory
at
the
first
sight
i
have
just
mentioned
how
the
aleoute
father
starves
for
days
and
weeks
and
gives
everything
eatable
to
his
child
and
how
the
bushman
mother
becomes
a
slave
to
follow
her
child
and
i
might
fill
pages
with
illustrations
of
the
really
tender
relations
existing
among
the
savages
and
their
children
travellers
continually
mention
them
incidentally
here
you
read
about
the
fond
love
of
a
mother
there
you
see
a
father
wildly
running
through
the
forest
and
carrying
upon
his
shoulders
his
child
bitten
by
a
snake
or
a
missionary
tells
you
the
despair
of
the
parents
at
the
loss
of
a
child
whom
he
had
saved
a
few
years
before
from
being
immolated
at
its
birth
you
learn
that
the
savage
mothers
usually
nurse
their
children
till
the
age
of
four
and
that
in
the
new
hebrides
on
the
loss
of
a
specially
beloved
child
its
mother
or
aunt
will
kill
herself
to
take
care
of
it
in
the
other
world
and
so
on
like
facts
are
met
with
by
the
score
so
that
when
we
see
that
these
same
loving
parents
practise
infanticide
we
are
bound
to
recognize
that
the
habit
whatever
its
ulterior
transformations
may
be
took
its
origin
under
the
sheer
pressure
of
necessity
as
an
obligation
towards
the
tribe
and
a
means
for
rearing
the
already
growing
children
the
savages
as
a
rule
do
not
multiply
without
stint
as
some
english
writers
put
it
on
the
contrary
they
take
all
kinds
of
measures
for
diminishing
the
a
whole
series
of
restrictions
which
europeans
certainly
would
find
extravagant
are
imposed
to
that
effect
and
they
are
strictly
obeyed
but
notwithstanding
that
primitive
folk
can
not
rear
all
their
children
however
it
has
been
remarked
that
as
soon
as
they
succeed
in
increasing
their
regular
means
of
subsistence
they
at
once
begin
to
abandon
the
practice
of
infanticide
on
the
whole
the
parents
obey
that
obligation
reluctantly
and
as
soon
as
they
can
afford
it
they
resort
to
all
kinds
of
compromises
to
save
the
lives
of
their
as
has
been
so
well
pointed
out
by
my
friend
elie
reclus
they
invent
the
lucky
and
unlucky
days
of
births
and
spare
the
children
born
on
the
lucky
days
they
try
to
postpone
the
sentence
for
a
few
hours
and
then
say
that
if
the
baby
has
lived
one
day
it
must
live
all
its
natural
life
they
hear
the
cries
of
the
little
ones
coming
from
the
forest
and
maintain
that
if
heard
they
forbode
a
misfortune
for
the
tribe
and
as
they
have
no
nor
creches
for
getting
rid
of
the
children
every
one
of
them
recoils
before
the
necessity
of
performing
the
cruel
sentence
they
prefer
to
expose
the
baby
in
the
wood
rather
than
to
take
its
life
by
violence
ignorance
not
cruelty
maintains
infanticide
and
instead
of
moralizing
the
savages
with
sermons
the
missionaries
would
do
better
to
follow
the
example
of
veniaminoff
who
every
year
till
his
old
age
crossed
the
sea
of
okhotsk
in
a
miserable
boat
or
travelled
on
dogs
among
his
tchuktchis
supplying
them
with
bread
and
fishing
implements
he
thus
had
really
stopped
infanticide
the
same
is
true
as
regards
what
superficial
observers
describe
as
parricide
we
just
now
saw
that
the
habit
of
abandoning
old
people
is
not
so
widely
spread
as
some
writers
have
maintained
it
to
be
it
has
been
extremely
exaggerated
but
it
is
occasionally
met
with
among
nearly
all
savages
and
in
such
cases
it
has
the
same
origin
as
the
exposure
of
children
when
a
savage
feels
that
he
is
a
burden
to
his
tribe
when
every
morning
his
share
of
food
is
taken
from
the
mouths
of
the
children
and
the
little
ones
are
not
so
stoical
as
their
fathers
they
cry
when
they
are
hungry
when
every
day
he
has
to
be
carried
across
the
stony
beach
or
the
virgin
forest
on
the
shoulders
of
younger
people
there
are
no
invalid
carriages
nor
destitutes
to
wheel
them
in
savage
lands
he
begins
to
repeat
what
the
old
russian
peasants
say
until
tchujoi
vek

live
other

life
it
is
time
to
retire
and
he
retires
he
does
what
the
soldier
does
in
a
similar
case
when
the
salvation
of
his
detachment
depends
upon
its
further
advance
and
he
can
move
no
more
and
knows
that
he
must
die
if
left
behind
the
soldier
implores
his
best
friend
to
render
him
the
last
service
before
leaving
the
encampment
and
the
friend
with
shivering
hands
discharges
his
gun
into
the
dying
body
so
the
savages
do
the
old
man
asks
himself
to
die
he
himself
insists
upon
this
last
duty
towards
the
community
and
obtains
the
consent
of
the
tribe
he
digs
out
his
grave
he
invites
his
kinsfolk
to
the
last
parting
meal
his
father
has
done
so
it
is
now
his
turn
and
he
parts
with
his
kinsfolk
with
marks
of
affection
the
savage
so
much
considers
death
as
part
of
his
duties
towards
his
community
that
he
not
only
refuses
to
be
rescued
as
moffat
has
told
but
when
a
woman
who
had
to
be
immolated
on
her
husband
grave
was
rescued
by
missionaries
and
was
taken
to
an
island
she
escaped
in
the
night
crossed
a
broad
swimming
and
rejoined
her
tribe
to
die
on
the
grave
it
has
become
with
them
a
matter
of
religion
but
the
savages
as
a
rule
are
so
reluctant
to
take
any
one
life
otherwise
than
in
fight
that
none
of
them
will
take
upon
himself
to
shed
human
blood
and
they
resort
to
all
kinds
of
stratagems
which
have
been
so
falsely
interpreted
in
most
cases
they
abandon
the
old
man
in
the
wood
after
having
given
him
more
than
his
share
of
the
common
food
arctic
expeditions
have
done
the
same
when
they
no
more
could
carry
their
invalid
comrades
live
a
few
days
more
maybe
there
will
be
some
unexpected
rescue
west
european
men
of
science
when
coming
across
these
facts
are
absolutely
unable
to
stand
them
they
can
not
reconcile
them
with
a
high
development
of
tribal
morality
and
they
prefer
to
cast
a
doubt
upon
the
exactitude
of
absolutely
reliable
observers
instead
of
trying
to
explain
the
parallel
existence
of
the
two
sets
of
facts
a
high
tribal
morality
together
with
the
abandonment
of
the
parents
and
infanticide
but
if
these
same
europeans
were
to
tell
a
savage
that
people
extremely
amiable
fond
of
their
own
children
and
so
impressionable
that
they
cry
when
they
see
a
misfortune
simulated
on
the
stage
are
living
in
europe
within
a
throw
from
dens
in
which
children
die
from
sheer
want
of
food
the
savage
too
would
not
understand
them
i
remember
how
vainly
i
tried
to
make
some
of
my
tungus
friends
understand
our
civilization
of
individualism
they
could
not
and
they
resorted
to
the
most
fantastical
suggestions
the
fact
is
that
a
savage
brought
up
in
ideas
of
a
tribal
solidarity
in
everything
for
bad
and
for
good
is
as
incapable
of
understanding
a
moral
european
who
knows
nothing
of
that
solidarity
as
the
average
european
is
incapable
of
understanding
the
savage
but
if
our
scientist
had
lived
amidst
a
tribe
which
does
not
possess
among
them
all
one
man
food
for
so
much
as
a
few
days
to
come
he
probably
might
have
understood
their
motives
so
also
the
savage
if
he
had
stayed
among
us
and
received
our
education
may
be
would
understand
our
european
indifference
towards
our
neighbours
and
our
royal
commissions
for
the
prevention
of
babyfarming
stone
houses
make
stony
hearts
the
russian
peasants
say
but
he
ought
to
live
in
a
stone
house
first
similar
remarks
must
be
made
as
regards
cannibalism
taking
into
account
all
the
facts
which
were
brought
to
light
during
a
recent
controversy
on
this
subject
at
the
paris
anthropological
society
and
many
incidental
remarks
scattered
throughout
the
savage
literature
we
are
bound
to
recognize
that
that
practice
was
brought
into
existence
by
sheer
necessity
but
that
it
was
further
developed
by
superstition
and
religion
into
the
proportions
it
attained
in
fiji
or
in
mexico
it
is
a
fact
that
until
this
day
many
savages
are
compelled
to
devour
corpses
in
the
most
advanced
state
of
putrefaction
and
that
in
cases
of
absolute
scarcity
some
of
them
have
had
to
disinter
and
to
feed
upon
human
corpses
even
during
an
epidemic
these
are
ascertained
facts
but
if
we
now
transport
ourselves
to
the
conditions
which
man
had
to
face
during
the
glacial
period
in
a
damp
and
cold
climate
with
but
little
vegetable
food
at
his
disposal
if
we
take
into
account
the
terrible
ravages
which
scurvy
still
makes
among
underfed
natives
and
remember
that
meat
and
fresh
blood
are
the
only
restoratives
which
they
know
we
must
admit
that
man
who
formerly
was
a
granivorous
animal
became
a
during
the
glacial
period
he
found
plenty
of
deer
at
that
time
but
deer
often
migrate
in
the
arctic
regions
and
sometimes
they
entirely
abandon
a
territory
for
a
number
of
years
in
such
cases
his
last
resources
disappeared
during
like
hard
trials
cannibalism
has
been
resorted
to
even
by
europeans
and
it
was
resorted
to
by
the
savages
until
the
present
time
they
occasionally
devour
the
corpses
of
their
own
dead
they
must
have
devoured
then
the
corpses
of
those
who
had
to
die
old
people
died
convinced
that
by
their
death
they
were
rendering
a
last
service
to
the
tribe
this
is
why
cannibalism
is
represented
by
some
savages
as
of
divine
origin
as
something
that
has
been
ordered
by
a
messenger
from
the
sky
but
later
on
it
lost
its
character
of
necessity
and
survived
as
a
superstition
enemies
had
to
be
eaten
in
order
to
inherit
their
courage
and
at
a
still
later
epoch
the
enemy
eye
or
heart
was
eaten
for
the
same
purpose
while
among
other
tribes
already
having
a
numerous
priesthood
and
a
developed
mythology
evil
gods
thirsty
for
human
blood
were
invented
and
human
sacrifices
required
by
the
priests
to
appease
the
gods
in
this
religious
phase
of
its
existence
cannibalism
attained
its
most
revolting
characters
mexico
is
a
example
and
in
fiji
where
the
king
could
eat
any
one
of
his
subjects
we
also
find
a
mighty
cast
of
priests
a
complicated
theology
and
a
full
development
of
autocracy
originated
by
necessity
cannibalism
became
at
a
later
period
a
religious
institution
and
in
this
form
it
survived
long
after
it
had
disappeared
from
among
tribes
which
certainly
practised
it
in
former
times
but
did
not
attain
the
theocratical
stage
of
evolution
the
same
remark
must
be
made
as
regards
infanticide
and
the
abandonment
of
parents
in
some
cases
they
also
have
been
maintained
as
a
survival
of
olden
times
as
a
tradition
of
the
past
i
will
terminate
my
remarks
by
mentioning
another
custom
which
also
is
a
source
of
most
erroneous
conclusions
i
mean
the
practice
of
all
savages
are
under
the
impression
that
blood
shed
must
be
revenged
by
blood
if
any
one
has
been
killed
the
murderer
must
die
if
any
one
has
been
wounded
the
aggressor
blood
must
be
shed
there
is
no
exception
to
the
rule
not
even
for
animals
so
the
hunter
blood
is
shed
on
his
return
to
the
village
when
he
has
shed
the
blood
of
an
animal
that
is
the
savages
conception
of
justice
a
conception
which
yet
prevails
in
western
europe
as
regards
murder
now
when
both
the
offender
and
the
offended
belong
to
the
same
tribe
the
tribe
and
the
offended
person
settle
the
affair
but
when
the
offender
belongs
to
another
tribe
and
that
tribe
for
one
reason
or
another
refuses
a
compensation
then
the
offended
tribe
decides
to
take
the
revenge
itself
primitive
folk
so
much
consider
every
one
acts
as
a
tribal
affair
dependent
upon
tribal
approval
that
they
easily
think
the
clan
responsible
for
every
one
acts
therefore
the
due
revenge
may
be
taken
upon
any
member
of
the
offender
clan
or
relatives
it
may
often
happen
however
that
the
retaliation
goes
further
than
the
offence
in
trying
to
inflict
a
wound
they
may
kill
the
offender
or
wound
him
more
than
they
intended
to
do
and
this
becomes
a
cause
for
a
new
feud
so
that
the
primitive
legislators
were
careful
in
requiring
the
retaliation
to
be
limited
to
an
eye
for
an
eye
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
and
blood
for
blood
it
is
remarkable
however
that
with
most
primitive
folk
like
feuds
are
infinitely
rarer
than
might
be
expected
though
with
some
of
them
they
may
attain
abnormal
proportions
especially
with
mountaineers
who
have
been
driven
to
the
highlands
by
foreign
invaders
such
as
the
mountaineers
of
caucasia
and
especially
those
of
borneo
the
dayaks
with
the
dayaks
we
were
told
lately
the
feuds
had
gone
so
far
that
a
young
man
could
neither
marry
nor
be
proclaimed
of
age
before
he
had
secured
the
head
of
an
enemy
this
horrid
practice
was
fully
described
in
a
modern
english
work
it
appears
however
that
this
affirmation
was
a
gross
exaggeration
moreover
dayak
takes
quite
another
aspect
when
we
learn
that
the
supposed
headhunter
is
not
actuated
at
all
by
personal
passion
he
acts
under
what
he
considers
as
a
moral
obligation
towards
his
tribe
just
as
the
european
judge
who
in
obedience
to
the
same
evidently
wrong
principle
of
blood
for
blood
hands
over
the
condemned
murderer
to
the
hangman
both
the
dayak
and
the
judge
would
even
feel
remorse
if
sympathy
moved
them
to
spare
the
murderer
that
is
why
the
dayaks
apart
from
the
murders
they
commit
when
actuated
by
their
conception
of
justice
are
depicted
by
all
those
who
know
them
as
a
most
sympathetic
people
thus
carl
bock
the
same
author
who
has
given
such
a
terrible
picture
of
writes
as
regards
morality
i
am
bound
to
assign
to
the
dayaks
a
high
place
in
the
scale
of
civilization
robberies
and
theft
are
entirely
unknown
among
them
they
also
are
very
truthful
if
i
did
not
always
get
the
truth
i
always
got
at
least
nothing
but
the
truth
from
them
i
wish
i
could
say
the
same
of
the
malays
pp
and
bock
testimony
is
fully
corroborated
by
that
of
ida
pfeiffer
i
fully
recognized
she
wrote
that
i
should
be
pleased
longer
to
travel
among
them
i
usually
found
them
honest
good
and
reserved
much
more
so
than
any
other
nation
i
know
stoltze
used
almost
the
same
language
when
speaking
of
them
the
dayaks
usually
have
but
one
wife
and
treat
her
well
they
are
very
sociable
and
every
morning
the
whole
clan
goes
out
for
fishing
hunting
or
gardening
in
large
parties
their
villages
consist
of
big
huts
each
of
which
is
inhabited
by
a
dozen
families
and
sometimes
by
several
hundred
persons
peacefully
living
together
they
show
great
respect
for
their
wives
and
are
fond
of
their
children
and
when
one
of
them
falls
ill
the
women
nurse
him
in
turn
as
a
rule
they
are
very
moderate
in
eating
and
drinking
such
is
the
dayak
in
his
real
daily
life
it
would
be
a
tedious
repetition
if
more
illustrations
from
savage
life
were
given
wherever
we
go
we
find
the
same
sociable
manners
the
same
spirit
of
solidarity
and
when
we
endeavour
to
penetrate
into
the
darkness
of
past
ages
we
find
the
same
tribal
life
the
same
associations
of
men
however
primitive
for
mutual
support
therefore
darwin
was
quite
right
when
he
saw
in
man
social
qualities
the
chief
factor
for
his
further
evolution
and
darwin
vulgarizers
are
entirely
wrong
when
they
maintain
the
contrary
the
small
strength
and
speed
of
man
he
wrote
his
want
of
natural
weapons
are
more
than
counterbalanced
firstly
by
his
intellectual
faculties
which
he
remarked
on
another
page
have
been
chiefly
or
even
exclusively
gained
for
the
benefit
of
the
community
and
secondly
by
his
social
qualities
which
led
him
to
give
and
receive
aid
from
his
fellow
men
in
the
last
century
the
savage
and
his
life
in
the
state
of
nature
were
idealized
but
now
men
of
science
have
gone
to
the
opposite
extreme
especially
since
some
of
them
anxious
to
prove
the
animal
origin
of
man
but
not
conversant
with
the
social
aspects
of
animal
life
began
to
charge
the
savage
with
all
imaginable
bestial
features
it
is
evident
however
that
this
exaggeration
is
even
more
unscientific
than
rousseau
idealization
the
savage
is
not
an
ideal
of
virtue
nor
is
he
an
ideal
of
savagery
but
the
primitive
man
has
one
quality
elaborated
and
maintained
by
the
very
necessities
of
his
hard
struggle
for
life
he
identifies
his
own
existence
with
that
of
his
tribe
and
without
that
quality
mankind
never
would
have
attained
the
level
it
has
attained
now
primitive
folk
as
has
been
already
said
so
much
identify
their
lives
with
that
of
the
tribe
that
each
of
their
acts
however
insignificant
is
considered
as
a
tribal
affair
their
whole
behaviour
is
regulated
by
an
infinite
series
of
unwritten
rules
of
propriety
which
are
the
fruit
of
their
common
experience
as
to
what
is
good
or
bad
that
is
beneficial
or
harmful
for
their
own
tribe
of
course
the
reasonings
upon
which
their
rules
of
propriety
are
based
sometimes
are
absurd
in
the
extreme
many
of
them
originate
in
superstition
and
altogether
in
whatever
the
savage
does
he
sees
but
the
immediate
consequences
of
his
acts
he
can
not
foresee
their
indirect
and
ulterior
consequences
thus
simply
exaggerating
a
defect
with
which
bentham
reproached
civilized
legislators
but
absurd
or
not
the
savage
obeys
the
prescriptions
of
the
common
law
however
inconvenient
they
may
be
he
obeys
them
even
more
blindly
than
the
civilized
man
obeys
the
prescriptions
of
the
written
law
his
common
law
is
his
religion
it
is
his
very
habit
of
living
the
idea
of
the
clan
is
always
present
to
his
mind
and
and
in
the
interest
of
the
clan
are
of
daily
occurrence
if
the
savage
has
infringed
one
of
the
smaller
tribal
rules
he
is
prosecuted
by
the
mockeries
of
the
women
if
the
infringement
is
grave
he
is
tortured
day
and
night
by
the
fear
of
having
called
a
calamity
upon
his
tribe
if
he
has
wounded
by
accident
any
one
of
his
own
clan
and
thus
has
committed
the
greatest
of
all
crimes
he
grows
quite
miserable
he
runs
away
in
the
woods
and
is
ready
to
commit
suicide
unless
the
tribe
absolves
him
by
inflicting
upon
him
a
physical
pain
and
sheds
some
of
his
own
blood
within
the
tribe
everything
is
shared
in
common
every
morsel
of
food
is
divided
among
all
present
and
if
the
savage
is
alone
in
the
woods
he
does
not
begin
eating
before
he
has
loudly
shouted
thrice
an
invitation
to
any
one
who
may
hear
his
voice
to
share
his
meal
in
short
within
the
tribe
the
rule
of
each
for
all
is
supreme
so
long
as
the
separate
family
has
not
yet
broken
up
the
tribal
unity
but
that
rule
is
not
extended
to
the
neighbouring
clans
or
tribes
even
when
they
are
federated
for
mutual
protection
each
tribe
or
clan
is
a
separate
unity
just
as
among
mammals
and
birds
the
territory
is
roughly
allotted
among
separate
tribes
and
except
in
times
of
war
the
boundaries
are
respected
on
entering
the
territory
of
his
neighbours
one
must
show
that
he
has
no
bad
intentions
the
louder
one
heralds
his
coming
the
more
confidence
he
wins
and
if
he
enters
a
house
he
must
deposit
his
hatchet
at
the
entrance
but
no
tribe
is
bound
to
share
its
food
with
the
others
it
may
do
so
or
it
may
not
therefore
the
life
of
the
savage
is
divided
into
two
sets
of
actions
and
appears
under
two
different
ethical
aspects
the
relations
within
the
tribe
and
the
relations
with
the
outsiders
and
like
our
international
law
the
law
widely
differs
from
the
common
law
therefore
when
it
comes
to
a
war
the
most
revolting
cruelties
may
be
considered
as
so
many
claims
upon
the
admiration
of
the
tribe
this
double
conception
of
morality
passes
through
the
whole
evolution
of
mankind
and
maintains
itself
until
now
we
europeans
have
realized
some
progress
not
immense
at
any
rate
in
eradicating
that
double
conception
of
ethics
but
it
also
must
be
said
that
while
we
have
in
some
measure
extended
our
ideas
of
solidarity
in
theory
at
least
over
the
nation
and
partly
over
other
nations
as
well
we
have
lessened
the
bonds
of
solidarity
within
our
own
nations
and
even
within
our
own
families
the
appearance
of
a
separate
family
amidst
the
clan
necessarily
disturbs
the
established
unity
a
separate
family
means
separate
property
and
accumulation
of
wealth
we
saw
how
the
eskimos
obviate
its
inconveniences
and
it
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
studies
to
follow
in
the
course
of
ages
the
different
institutions
village
communities
guilds
and
so
on
by
means
of
which
the
masses
endeavoured
to
maintain
the
tribal
unity
notwithstanding
the
agencies
which
were
at
work
to
break
it
down
on
the
other
hand
the
first
rudiments
of
knowledge
which
appeared
at
an
extremely
remote
epoch
when
they
confounded
themselves
with
witchcraft
also
became
a
power
in
the
hands
of
the
individual
which
could
be
used
against
the
tribe
they
were
carefully
kept
in
secrecy
and
transmitted
to
the
initiated
only
in
the
secret
societies
of
witches
shamans
and
priests
which
we
find
among
all
savages
by
the
same
time
wars
and
invasions
created
military
authority
as
also
castes
of
warriors
whose
associations
or
clubs
acquired
great
powers
however
at
no
period
of
man
life
were
wars
the
normal
state
of
existence
while
warriors
exterminated
each
other
and
the
priests
celebrated
their
massacres
the
masses
continued
to
live
their
daily
life
they
prosecuted
their
daily
toil
and
it
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
studies
to
follow
that
life
of
the
masses
to
study
the
means
by
which
they
maintained
their
own
social
organization
which
was
based
upon
their
own
conceptions
of
equity
mutual
aid
and
mutual
support
of

forms
and
maintaining
that
the

laws
lie
at
the
very
basis
of

of

they
were
accused
of
exaggeration
however
the
most
careful
researches
prosecuted
since
by
a
phalanx
of
students
of

have
proved
that
all
races
of
mankind
bear
traces
of
having
passed
through
similar

of

laws
such
as
we

it
would
be
impossible
to
enter
here
into
a
discussion
of
the
origin
of
the
marriage
restrictions
let
me
only
remark
that
a
division
into
groups
similar
to
morgan
hawaian
exists
among
birds
the
young
broods
live
together
separately
from
their
parents
a
like
division
might
probably
be
traced
among
some
mammals
as
well
as
to
the
prohibition
of
relations
between
brothers
and
sisters
it
is
more
likely
to
have
arisen
not
from
speculations
about
the
bad
effects
of
consanguinity
which
speculations
really
do
not
seem
probable
but
to
avoid
the
precocity
of
like
marriages
under
close
cohabitation
it
must
have
become
of
imperious
necessity
i
must
also
remark
that
in
discussing
the
origin
of
new
customs
altogether
we
must
keep
in
mind
that
the
savages
like
us
have
their
thinkers
and
doctors
prophets
whose
knowledge
and
ideas
are
in
advance
upon
those
of
the

united
as
they
are

almost

feature
they
are

ancient

were
the
conclusions
arrived
at
in

however
as
soon
as
we
come
to
a

stage
of
civilization
and
refer
to

which
already
has
something
to
say

to

with
this

of

in
his

the
pessimist
philosopher
triumphantly
concludes
that
warfare
and
oppression
are
the
very
essence
of
human
nature
that
the
warlike
and
predatory
instincts
of
man
can
only
be
restrained
within
certain
limits
by
a
strong
authority
which
enforces
peace
and
thus
gives
an
opportunity
to
the
few
and
nobler
ones
to
prepare
a
better
life
for
humanity
in
times
to
come
and
yet
as
soon
as
the
life
of
man
during
the
historical
period
is
submitted
to
a
closer
analysis
and
so
it
has
been
of
late
by
many
patient
students
of
very
early
institutions
it
appears
at
once
under
quite
a
different
aspect
leaving
aside
the
preconceived
ideas
of
most
historians
and
their
pronounced
predilection
for
the
dramatic
aspects
of
history
we
see
that
the
very
documents
they
habitually
peruse
are
such
as
to
exaggerate
the
part
of
human
life
given
to
struggles
and
to
underrate
its
peaceful
moods
the
bright
and
sunny
days
are
lost
sight
of
in
the
gales
and
storms
even
in
our
own
time
the
cumbersome
records
which
we
prepare
for
the
future
historian
in
our
press
our
law
courts
our
government
offices
and
even
in
our
fiction
and
poetry
suffer
from
the
same
they
hand
down
to
posterity
the
most
minute
descriptions
of
every
war
every
battle
and
skirmish
every
contest
and
act
of
violence
every
kind
of
individual
suffering
but
they
hardly
bear
any
trace
of
the
countless
acts
of
mutual
support
and
devotion
which
every
one
of
us
knows
from
his
own
experience
they
hardly
take
notice
of
what
makes
the
very
essence
of
our
daily
life
our
social
instincts
and
manners
no
wonder
then
if
the
records
of
the
past
were
so
imperfect
the
annalists
of
old
never
failed
to
chronicle
the
petty
wars
and
calamities
which
harassed
their
contemporaries
but
they
paid
no
attention
whatever
to
the
life
of
the
masses
although
the
masses
chiefly
used
to
toil
peacefully
while
the
few
indulged
in
fighting
the
epic
poems
the
inscriptions
on
monuments
the
treaties
of
peace
nearly
all
historical
documents
bear
the
same
character
they
deal
with
breaches
of
peace
not
with
peace
itself
so
that
the
historian
unconsciously
draws
a
distorted
picture
of
the
times
he
endeavours
to
depict
and
to
restore
the
real
proportion
between
conflict
and
union
we
are
now
bound
to
enter
into
a
minute
analysis
of
thousands
of
small
facts
and
faint
indications
accidentally
preserved
in
the
relics
of
the
past
to
interpret
them
with
the
aid
of
comparative
ethnology
and
after
having
heard
so
much
about
what
used
to
divide
men
to
reconstruct
stone
by
stone
the
institutions
which
used
to
unite
them
ere
long
history
will
have
to
be
on
new
lines
so
as
to
take
into
account
these
two
currents
of
human
life
and
to
appreciate
the
part
played
by
each
of
them
in
evolution
but
in
the
meantime
we
may
avail
ourselves
of
the
immense
preparatory
work
recently
done
towards
restoring
the
leading
features
of
the
second
current
so
much
neglected
from
the
periods
of
history
we
may
take
some
illustrations
of
the
life
of
the
masses
in
order
to
indicate
the
part
played
by
mutual
support
during
those
periods
and
in
so
doing
we
may
dispense
for
the
sake
of
brevity
from
going
as
far
back
as
the
egyptian
or
even
the
greek
and
roman
antiquity
for
in
fact
the
evolution
of
mankind
has
not
had
the
character
of
one
unbroken
series
several
times
civilization
came
to
an
end
in
one
given
region
with
one
given
race
and
began
anew
elsewhere
among
other
races
but
at
each
fresh
start
it
began
again
with
the
same
clan
institutions
which
we
have
seen
among
the
savages
so
that
if
we
take
the
last
start
of
our
own
civilization
when
it
began
afresh
in
the
first
centuries
of
our
era
among
those
whom
the
romans
called
the
barbarians
we
shall
have
the
whole
scale
of
evolution
beginning
with
the
gentes
and
ending
in
the
institutions
of
our
own
time
to
these
illustrations
the
following
pages
will
be
devoted
men
of
science
have
not
yet
settled
upon
the
causes
which
some
two
thousand
years
ago
drove
whole
nations
from
asia
into
europe
and
resulted
in
the
great
migrations
of
barbarians
which
put
an
end
to
the
west
roman
empire
one
cause
however
is
naturally
suggested
to
the
geographer
as
he
contemplates
the
ruins
of
populous
cities
in
the
deserts
of
central
asia
or
follows
the
old
beds
of
rivers
now
disappeared
and
the
wide
outlines
of
lakes
now
reduced
to
the
size
of
mere
ponds
it
is
desiccation
a
quite
recent
desiccation
continued
still
at
a
speed
which
we
formerly
were
not
prepared
to
admit
against
it
man
was
powerless
when
the
inhabitants
of
mongolia
and
east
turkestan
saw
that
water
was
abandoning
them
they
had
no
course
open
to
them
but
to
move
down
the
broad
valleys
leading
to
the
lowlands
and
to
thrust
westwards
the
inhabitants
of
the
plains
stems
after
stems
were
thus
thrown
into
europe
compelling
other
stems
to
move
and
to
remove
for
centuries
in
succession
westwards
and
eastwards
in
search
of
new
and
more
or
less
permanent
abodes
races
were
mixing
with
races
during
those
migrations
aborigines
with
immigrants
aryans
with
and
it
would
have
been
no
wonder
if
the
social
institutions
which
had
kept
them
together
in
their
mother
countries
had
been
totally
wrecked
during
the
stratification
of
races
which
took
place
in
europe
and
asia
but
they
were
not
wrecked
they
simply
underwent
the
modification
which
was
required
by
the
new
conditions
of
life
the
teutons
the
celts
the
scandinavians
the
slavonians
and
others
when
they
first
came
in
contact
with
the
romans
were
in
a
transitional
state
of
social
organization
the
clan
unions
based
upon
a
real
or
supposed
common
origin
had
kept
them
together
for
many
thousands
of
years
in
succession
but
these
unions
could
answer
their
purpose
so
long
only
as
there
were
no
separate
families
within
the
gens
or
clan
itself
however
for
causes
already
mentioned
the
separate
patriarchal
family
had
slowly
but
steadily
developed
within
the
clans
and
in
the
long
run
it
evidently
meant
the
individual
accumulation
of
wealth
and
power
and
the
hereditary
transmission
of
both
the
frequent
migrations
of
the
barbarians
and
the
ensuing
wars
only
hastened
the
division
of
the
gentes
into
separate
families
while
the
dispersing
of
stems
and
their
mingling
with
strangers
offered
singular
facilities
for
the
ultimate
disintegration
of
those
unions
which
were
based
upon
kinship
the
barbarians
thus
stood
in
a
position
of
either
seeing
their
clans
dissolved
into
loose
aggregations
of
families
of
which
the
wealthiest
especially
if
combining
sacerdotal
functions
or
military
repute
with
wealth
would
have
succeeded
in
imposing
their
authority
upon
the
others
or
of
finding
out
some
new
form
of
organization
based
upon
some
new
principle
many
stems
had
no
force
to
resist
disintegration
they
broke
up
and
were
lost
for
history
but
the
more
vigorous
ones
did
not
disintegrate
they
came
out
of
the
ordeal
with
a
new
organization
the
village
community
which
kept
them
together
for
the
next
fifteen
centuries
or
more
the
conception
of
a
common
territory
appropriated
or
protected
by
common
efforts
was
elaborated
and
it
took
the
place
of
the
vanishing
conceptions
of
common
descent
the
common
gods
gradually
lost
their
character
of
ancestors
and
were
endowed
with
a
local
territorial
character
they
became
the
gods
or
saints
of
a
given
locality
the
land
was
identified
with
its
inhabitants
territorial
unions
grew
up
instead
of
the
consanguine
unions
of
old
and
this
new
organization
evidently
offered
many
advantages
under
the
given
circumstances
it
recognized
the
independence
of
the
family
and
even
emphasized
it
the
village
community
disclaiming
all
rights
of
interference
in
what
was
going
on
within
the
family
enclosure
it
gave
much
more
freedom
to
personal
initiative
it
was
not
hostile
in
principle
to
union
between
men
of
different
descent
and
it
maintained
at
the
same
time
the
necessary
cohesion
of
action
and
thought
while
it
was
strong
enough
to
oppose
the
dominative
tendencies
of
the
minorities
of
wizards
priests
and
professional
or
distinguished
warriors
consequently
it
became
the
primary
cell
of
future
organization
and
with
many
nations
the
village
community
has
retained
this
character
until
now
it
is
now
known
and
scarcely
contested
that
the
village
community
was
not
a
specific
feature
of
the
slavonians
nor
even
of
the
ancient
teutons
it
prevailed
in
england
during
both
the
saxon
and
norman
times
and
partially
survived
till
the
last
century
it
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
social
organization
of
old
scotland
old
ireland
and
old
wales
in
france
the
communal
possession
and
the
communal
allotment
of
arable
land
by
the
village
folkmote
persisted
from
the
first
centuries
of
our
era
till
the
times
of
turgot
who
found
the
folkmotes
too
noisy
and
therefore
abolished
them
it
survived
roman
rule
in
italy
and
revived
after
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
it
was
the
rule
with
the
scandinavians
the
slavonians
the
finns
in
the
pittaya
as
also
probably
the
the
coures
and
the
lives
the
village
community
in
india
past
and
present
aryan
and
is
well
known
through
the
works
of
sir
henry
maine
and
elphinstone
has
described
it
among
the
afghans
we
also
find
it
in
the
mongolian
oulous
the
kabyle
thaddart
the
javanese
dessa
the
malayan
kota
or
tofa
and
under
a
variety
of
names
in
abyssinia
the
soudan
in
the
interior
of
africa
with
natives
of
both
americas
with
all
the
small
and
large
tribes
of
the
pacific
archipelagoes
in
short
we
do
not
know
one
single
human
race
or
one
single
nation
which
has
not
had
its
period
of
village
communities
this
fact
alone
disposes
of
the
theory
according
to
which
the
village
community
in
europe
would
have
been
a
servile
growth
it
is
anterior
to
serfdom
and
even
servile
submission
was
powerless
to
break
it
it
was
a
universal
phase
of
evolution
a
natural
outcome
of
the
clan
organization
with
all
those
stems
at
least
which
have
played
or
play
still
some
part
in
history
it
was
a
natural
growth
and
an
absolute
uniformity
in
its
structure
was
therefore
not
possible
as
a
rule
it
was
a
union
between
families
considered
as
of
common
descent
and
owning
a
certain
territory
in
common
but
with
some
stems
and
under
certain
circumstances
the
families
used
to
grow
very
numerous
before
they
threw
off
new
buds
in
the
shape
of
new
families
five
six
or
seven
generations
continued
to
live
under
the
same
roof
or
within
the
same
enclosure
owning
their
joint
household
and
cattle
in
common
and
taking
their
meals
at
the
common
hearth
they
kept
in
such
case
to
what
ethnology
knows
as
the
joint
family
or
the
undivided
household
which
we
still
see
all
over
china
in
india
in
the
south
slavonian
zadruga
and
occasionally
find
in
africa
in
america
in
denmark
in
north
russia
and
west
france
with
other
stems
or
in
other
circumstances
not
yet
well
specified
the
families
did
not
attain
the
same
proportions
the
grandsons
and
occasionally
the
sons
left
the
household
as
soon
as
they
were
married
and
each
of
them
started
a
new
cell
of
his
own
but
joint
or
not
clustered
together
or
scattered
in
the
woods
the
families
remained
united
into
village
communities
several
villages
were
grouped
into
tribes
and
the
tribes
joined
into
confederations
such
was
the
social
organization
which
developed
among
the
barbarians
when
they
began
to
settle
more
or
less
permanently
in
europe
a
very
long
evolution
was
required
before
the
gentes
or
clans
recognized
the
separate
existence
of
a
patriarchal
family
in
a
separate
hut
but
even
after
that
had
been
recognized
the
clan
as
a
rule
knew
no
personal
inheritance
of
property
the
few
things
which
might
have
belonged
personally
to
the
individual
were
either
destroyed
on
his
grave
or
buried
with
him
the
village
community
on
the
contrary
fully
recognized
the
private
accumulation
of
wealth
within
the
family
and
its
hereditary
transmission
but
wealth
was
conceived
exclusively
in
the
shape
of
movable
property
including
cattle
implements
arms
and
the
dwelling
house
which
like
all
things
that
can
be
destroyed
by
fire
belonged
to
the
same
category
as
to
private
property
in
land
the
village
community
did
not
and
could
not
recognize
anything
of
the
kind
and
as
a
rule
it
does
not
recognize
it
now
the
land
was
the
common
property
of
the
tribe
or
of
the
whole
stem
and
the
village
community
itself
owned
its
part
of
the
tribal
territory
so
long
only
as
the
tribe
did
not
claim
a
of
the
village
allotments
the
clearing
of
the
woods
and
the
breaking
of
the
prairies
being
mostly
done
by
the
communities
or
at
least
by
the
joint
work
of
several
families
always
with
the
consent
of
the
community
the
cleared
plots
were
held
by
each
family
for
a
term
of
four
twelve
or
twenty
years
after
which
term
they
were
treated
as
parts
of
the
arable
land
owned
in
common
private
property
or
possession
for
ever
was
as
incompatible
with
the
very
principles
and
the
religious
conceptions
of
the
village
community
as
it
was
with
the
principles
of
the
gens
so
that
a
long
influence
of
the
roman
law
and
the
christian
church
which
soon
accepted
the
roman
principles
were
required
to
accustom
the
barbarians
to
the
idea
of
private
property
in
land
being
possible
and
yet
even
when
such
property
or
possession
for
an
unlimited
time
was
recognized
the
owner
of
a
separate
estate
remained
a
in
the
waste
lands
forests
and
moreover
we
continually
see
especially
in
the
history
of
russia
that
when
a
few
families
acting
separately
had
taken
possession
of
some
land
belonging
to
tribes
which
were
treated
as
strangers
they
very
soon
united
together
and
constituted
a
village
community
which
in
the
third
or
fourth
generation
began
to
profess
a
community
of
origin
a
whole
series
of
institutions
partly
inherited
from
the
clan
period
have
developed
from
that
basis
of
common
ownership
of
land
during
the
long
succession
of
centuries
which
was
required
to
bring
the
barbarians
under
the
dominion
of
states
organized
upon
the
roman
or
byzantine
pattern
the
village
community
was
not
only
a
union
for
guaranteeing
to
each
one
his
fair
share
in
the
common
land
but
also
a
union
for
common
culture
for
mutual
support
in
all
possible
forms
for
protection
from
violence
and
for
a
further
development
of
knowledge
national
bonds
and
moral
conceptions
and
every
change
in
the
judicial
military
educational
or
economical
manners
had
to
be
decided
at
the
folkmotes
of
the
village
the
tribe
or
the
confederation
the
community
being
a
continuation
of
the
gens
it
inherited
all
its
functions
it
was
the
universitas
the
mir
a
world
in
itself
common
hunting
common
fishing
and
common
culture
of
the
orchards
or
the
plantations
of
fruit
trees
was
the
rule
with
the
old
gentes
common
agriculture
became
the
rule
in
the
barbarian
village
communities
true
that
direct
testimony
to
this
effect
is
scarce
and
in
the
literature
of
antiquity
we
only
have
the
passages
of
diodorus
and
julius
caesar
relating
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
lipari
islands
one
of
the
tribes
and
the
sueves
but
there
is
no
lack
of
evidence
to
prove
that
common
agriculture
was
practised
among
some
teuton
tribes
the
franks
and
the
old
scotch
irish
and
welsh
as
to
the
later
survivals
of
the
same
practice
they
simply
are
countless
even
in
perfectly
romanized
france
common
culture
was
habitual
some
five
and
twenty
years
ago
in
the
morbihan
brittany
the
old
welsh
cyvar
or
joint
team
as
well
as
the
common
culture
of
the
land
allotted
to
the
use
of
the
village
sanctuary
are
quite
common
among
the
tribes
of
caucasus
the
least
touched
by
civilization
and
like
facts
are
of
daily
occurrence
among
the
russian
peasants
moreover
it
is
well
known
that
many
tribes
of
brazil
central
america
and
mexico
used
to
cultivate
their
fields
in
common
and
that
the
same
habit
is
widely
spread
among
some
malayans
in
new
caledonia
with
several
negro
stems
and
so
on
in
short
communal
culture
is
so
habitual
with
many
aryan
mongolian
negro
red
indian
malayan
and
melanesian
stems
that
we
must
consider
it
as
a
universal
though
not
as
the
only
possible
form
of
primitive
agriculture
communal
cultivation
does
not
however
imply
by
necessity
communal
consumption
already
under
the
clan
organization
we
often
see
that
when
the
boats
laden
with
fruits
or
fish
return
to
the
village
the
food
they
bring
in
is
divided
among
the
huts
and
the
long
houses
inhabited
by
either
several
families
or
the
youth
and
is
cooked
separately
at
each
separate
hearth
the
habit
of
taking
meals
in
a
narrower
circle
of
relatives
or
associates
thus
prevails
at
an
early
period
of
clan
life
it
became
the
rule
in
the
village
community
even
the
food
grown
in
common
was
usually
divided
between
the
households
after
part
of
it
had
been
laid
in
store
for
communal
use
however
the
tradition
of
communal
meals
was
piously
kept
alive
every
available
opportunity
such
as
the
commemoration
of
the
ancestors
the
religious
festivals
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
field
work
the
births
the
marriages
and
the
funerals
being
seized
upon
to
bring
the
community
to
a
common
meal
even
now
this
habit
well
known
in
this
country
as
the
harvest
supper
is
the
last
to
disappear
on
the
other
hand
even
when
the
fields
had
long
since
ceased
to
be
tilled
and
sown
in
common
a
variety
of
agricultural
work
continued
and
continues
still
to
be
performed
by
the
community
some
part
of
the
communal
land
is
still
cultivated
in
many
cases
in
common
either
for
the
use
of
the
destitute
or
for
refilling
the
communal
stores
or
for
using
the
produce
at
the
religious
festivals
the
irrigation
canals
are
digged
and
repaired
in
common
the
communal
meadows
are
mown
by
the
community
and
the
sight
of
a
russian
commune
mowing
a
meadow
the
men
rivalling
each
other
in
their
advance
with
the
scythe
while
the
women
turn
the
grass
over
and
throw
it
up
into
heaps
is
one
of
the
most
inspiring
sights
it
shows
what
human
work
might
be
and
ought
to
be
the
hay
in
such
case
is
divided
among
the
separate
households
and
it
is
evident
that
no
one
has
the
right
of
taking
hay
from
a
neighbour
stack
without
his
permission
but
the
limitation
of
this
last
rule
among
the
caucasian
ossetes
is
most
noteworthy
when
the
cuckoo
cries
and
announces
that
spring
is
coming
and
that
the
meadows
will
soon
be
clothed
again
with
grass
every
one
in
need
has
the
right
of
taking
from
a
neighbour
stack
the
hay
he
wants
for
his
cattle
the
old
communal
rights
are
thus
as
if
to
prove
how
contrary
unbridled
individualism
is
to
human
nature
when
the
european
traveller
lands
in
some
small
island
of
the
pacific
and
seeing
at
a
distance
a
grove
of
palm
trees
walks
in
that
direction
he
is
astonished
to
discover
that
the
little
villages
are
connected
by
roads
paved
with
big
stones
quite
comfortable
for
the
unshod
natives
and
very
similar
to
the
old
roads
of
the
swiss
mountains
such
roads
were
traced
by
the
barbarians
all
over
europe
and
one
must
have
travelled
in
wild
countries
far
away
from
the
chief
lines
of
communication
to
realize
in
full
the
immense
work
that
must
have
been
performed
by
the
barbarian
communities
in
order
to
conquer
the
woody
and
marshy
wilderness
which
europe
was
some
two
thousand
years
ago
isolated
families
having
no
tools
and
weak
as
they
were
could
not
have
conquered
it
the
wilderness
would
have
overpowered
them
village
communities
alone
working
in
common
could
master
the
wild
forests
the
sinking
marshes
and
the
endless
steppes
the
rough
roads
the
ferries
the
wooden
bridges
taken
away
in
the
winter
and
rebuilt
after
the
spring
flood
was
over
the
fences
and
the
palisaded
walls
of
the
villages
the
earthen
forts
and
the
small
towers
with
which
the
territory
was
dottedall
these
were
the
work
of
the
barbarian
communities
and
when
a
community
grew
numerous
it
used
to
throw
off
a
new
bud
a
new
community
arose
at
a
distance
thus
step
by
step
bringing
the
woods
and
the
steppes
under
the
dominion
of
man
the
whole
making
of
european
nations
was
such
a
budding
of
the
village
communities
even
the
russian
peasants
if
they
are
not
quite
broken
down
by
misery
migrate
in
communities
and
they
till
the
soil
and
build
the
houses
in
com
mon
when
they
settle
on
the
banks
of
the
amur
or
in
manitoba
and
even
the
english
when
they
first
began
to
colonize
america
used
to
return
to
the
old
system
they
grouped
into
village
communities
the
village
community
was
the
chief
arm
of
the
barbarians
in
their
hard
struggle
against
a
hostile
nature
it
also
was
the
bond
they
opposed
to
oppression
by
the
cunningest
and
the
strongest
which
so
easily
might
have
developed
during
those
disturbed
times
the
imaginary
barbarian
the
man
who
fights
and
kills
at
his
mere
caprice
existed
no
more
than
the
bloodthirsty
savage
the
real
barbarian
was
living
on
the
contrary
under
a
wide
series
of
institutions
imbued
with
considerations
as
to
what
may
be
useful
or
noxious
to
his
tribe
or
confederation
and
these
institutions
were
piously
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
in
verses
and
songs
in
proverbs
or
triads
in
sentences
and
instructions
the
more
we
study
them
the
more
we
recognize
the
narrow
bonds
which
united
men
in
their
villages
every
quarrel
arising
between
two
individuals
was
treated
as
a
communal
affair
even
the
offensive
words
that
might
have
been
uttered
during
a
quarrel
being
considered
as
an
offence
to
the
community
and
its
ancestors
they
had
to
be
repaired
by
amends
made
both
to
the
individual
and
the
community
and
if
a
quarrel
ended
in
a
fight
and
wounds
the
man
who
stood
by
and
did
not
interpose
was
treated
as
if
he
himself
had
inflicted
the
wounds
the
judicial
procedure
was
imbued
with
the
same
spirit
every
dispute
was
brought
first
before
mediators
or
arbiters
and
it
mostly
ended
with
them
the
arbiters
playing
a
very
important
part
in
barbarian
society
but
if
the
case
was
too
grave
to
be
settled
in
this
way
it
came
before
the
folkmote
which
was
bound
to
find
the
sentence
and
pronounced
it
in
a
conditional
form
that
is
such
compensation
was
due
if
the
wrong
be
proved
and
the
wrong
had
to
be
proved
or
disclaimed
by
six
or
twelve
persons
confirming
or
denying
the
fact
by
oath
ordeal
being
resorted
to
in
case
of
contradiction
between
the
two
sets
of
jurors
such
procedure
which
remained
in
force
for
more
than
two
thousand
years
in
succession
speaks
volumes
for
itself
it
shows
how
close
were
the
bonds
between
all
members
of
the
community
moreover
there
was
no
other
authority
to
enforce
the
decisions
of
the
folkmote
besides
its
own
moral
authority
the
only
possible
menace
was
that
the
community
might
declare
the
rebel
an
outlaw
but
even
this
menace
was
reciprocal
a
man
discontented
with
the
folkmote
could
declare
that
he
would
abandon
the
tribe
and
go
over
to
another
tribe
a
most
dreadful
menace
as
it
was
sure
to
bring
all
kinds
of
misfortunes
upon
a
tribe
that
might
have
been
unfair
to
one
of
its
members
a
rebellion
against
a
right
decision
of
the
customary
law
was
simply
inconceivable
as
henry
maine
has
so
well
said
because
law
morality
and
fact
could
not
be
separated
from
each
other
in
those
times
the
moral
authority
of
the
commune
was
so
great
that
even
at
a
much
later
epoch
when
the
village
communities
fell
into
submission
to
the
feudal
lord
they
maintained
their
judicial
powers
they
only
permitted
the
lord
or
his
deputy
to
find
the
above
conditional
sentence
in
accordance
with
the
customary
law
he
had
sworn
to
follow
and
to
levy
for
himself
the
fine
the
fred
due
to
the
commune
but
for
a
long
time
the
lord
himself
if
he
remained
a
in
the
waste
land
of
the
commune
submitted
in
communal
affairs
to
its
decisions
noble
or
ecclesiastic
he
had
to
submit
to
the
folkmote
wer
daselbst
wasser
und
weid
genusst
muss
gehorsam
sein
who
enjoys
here
the
right
of
water
and
pasture
must
obey
was
the
old
saying
even
when
the
peasants
became
serfs
under
the
lord
he
was
bound
to
appear
before
the
folkmote
when
they
summoned
him
in
their
conceptions
of
justice
the
barbarians
evidently
did
not
much
differ
from
the
savages
they
also
maintained
the
idea
that
a
murder
must
be
followed
by
putting
the
murderer
to
death
that
wounds
had
to
be
punished
by
equal
wounds
and
that
the
wronged
family
was
bound
to
fulfil
the
sentence
of
the
customary
law
this
was
a
holy
duty
a
duty
towards
the
ancestors
which
had
to
be
accomplished
in
broad
daylight
never
in
secrecy
and
rendered
widely
known
therefore
the
most
inspired
passages
of
the
sagas
and
epic
poetry
altogether
are
those
which
glorify
what
was
supposed
to
be
justice
the
gods
themselves
joined
in
aiding
it
however
the
predominant
feature
of
barbarian
justice
is
on
the
one
hand
to
limit
the
numbers
of
persons
who
may
be
involved
in
a
feud
and
on
the
other
hand
to
extirpate
the
brutal
idea
of
blood
for
blood
and
wounds
for
wounds
by
substituting
for
it
the
system
of
compensation
the
barbarian
codes
which
were
collections
of
common
law
rules
written
down
for
the
use
of
judges
first
permitted
then
encouraged
and
at
last
enforced
compensation
instead
of
revenge
the
compensation
has
however
been
totally
misunderstood
by
those
who
represented
it
as
a
fine
and
as
a
sort
of
carte
blanche
given
to
the
rich
man
to
do
whatever
he
liked
the
compensation
money
wergeld
which
was
quite
different
from
the
fine
or
fred
was
habitually
so
high
for
all
kinds
of
active
offences
that
it
certainly
was
no
encouragement
for
such
offences
in
case
of
a
murder
it
usually
exceeded
all
the
possible
fortune
of
the
murderer
eighteen
times
eighteen
cows
is
the
compensation
with
the
ossetes
who
do
not
know
how
to
reckon
above
eighteen
while
with
the
african
tribes
it
attains
cows
or
camels
with
their
young
or
sheep
in
the
poorer
tribes
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
the
compensation
money
could
not
be
paid
at
all
so
that
the
murderer
had
no
issue
but
to
induce
the
wronged
family
by
repentance
to
adopt
him
even
now
in
the
caucasus
when
feuds
come
to
an
end
the
offender
touches
with
his
lips
the
breast
of
the
oldest
woman
of
the
tribe
and
becomes
a
to
all
men
of
the
wronged
family
with
several
african
tribes
he
must
give
his
daughter
or
sister
in
marriage
to
some
one
of
the
family
with
other
tribes
he
is
bound
to
marry
the
woman
whom
he
has
made
a
widow
and
in
all
cases
he
becomes
a
member
of
the
family
whose
opinion
is
taken
in
all
important
family
matters
far
from
acting
with
disregard
to
human
life
the
barbarians
moreover
knew
nothing
of
the
horrid
punishments
introduced
at
a
later
epoch
by
the
laic
and
canonic
laws
under
roman
and
byzantine
influence
for
if
the
saxon
code
admitted
the
death
penalty
rather
freely
even
in
cases
of
incendiarism
and
armed
robbery
the
other
barbarian
codes
pronounced
it
exclusively
in
cases
of
betrayal
of
one
kin
and
sacrilege
against
the
community
gods
as
the
only
means
to
appease
the
gods
all
this
as
seen
is
very
far
from
the
supposed
moral
dissoluteness
of
the
barbarians
on
the
contrary
we
can
not
but
admire
the
deeply
moral
principles
elaborated
within
the
early
village
communities
which
found
their
expression
in
welsh
triads
in
legends
about
king
arthur
in
brehon
commentaries
in
old
german
legends
and
so
on
or
find
still
their
expression
in
the
sayings
of
the
modern
barbarians
in
his
introduction
to
the
story
of
burnt
njal
george
dasent
very
justly
sums
up
as
follows
the
qualities
of
a
northman
as
they
appear
in
the
sagas
to
do
what
lay
before
him
openly
and
like
a
man
without
fear
of
either
foes
fiends
or
fate
to
be
free
and
daring
in
all
his
deeds
to
be
gentle
and
generous
to
his
friends
and
kinsmen
to
be
stern
and
grim
to
his
foes
those
who
are
under
the
lex
talionis
but
even
towards
them
to
fulfil
all
bounden
duties
to
be
no
nor
nor
backbiter
to
utter
nothing
against
any
man
that
he
would
not
dare
to
tell
him
to
his
face
to
turn
no
man
from
his
door
who
sought
food
or
shelter
even
though
he
were
a
foe
the
same
or
still
better
principles
permeate
the
welsh
epic
poetry
and
triads
to
act
according
to
the
nature
of
mildness
and
the
principles
of
equity
without
regard
to
the
foes
or
to
the
friends
and
to
repair
the
wrong
are
the
highest
duties
of
man
evil
is
death
good
is
life
exclaims
the
poet
legislator
the
world
would
be
fool
if
agreements
made
on
lips
were
not
honourable
the
brehon
law
says
and
the
humble
shamanist
mordovian
after
having
praised
the
same
qualities
will
add
moreover
in
his
principles
of
customary
law
that
among
neighbours
the
cow
and
the
are
in
common
that
the
cow
must
be
milked
for
yourself
and
him
who
may
ask
milk
that
the
body
of
a
child
reddens
from
the
stroke
but
the
face
of
him
who
strikes
reddens
from
shame
and
so
on
many
pages
might
be
filled
with
like
principles
expressed
and
followed
by
the
barbarians
one
feature
more
of
the
old
village
communities
deserves
a
special
mention
it
is
the
gradual
extension
of
the
circle
of
men
embraced
by
the
feelings
of
solidarity
not
only
the
tribes
federated
into
stems
but
the
stems
as
well
even
though
of
different
origin
joined
together
in
confederations
some
unions
were
so
close
that
for
instance
the
vandals
after
part
of
their
confederation
had
left
for
the
rhine
and
thence
went
over
to
spain
and
africa
respected
for
forty
consecutive
years
the
landmarks
and
the
abandoned
villages
of
their
confederates
and
did
not
take
possession
of
them
until
they
had
ascertained
through
envoys
that
their
confederates
did
not
intend
to
return
with
other
barbarians
the
soil
was
cultivated
by
one
part
of
the
stem
while
the
other
part
fought
on
or
beyond
the
frontiers
of
the
common
territory
as
to
the
leagues
between
several
stems
they
were
quite
habitual
the
sicambers
united
with
the
cherusques
and
the
sueves
the
quades
with
the
sarmates
the
sarmates
with
the
alans
the
carpes
and
the
huns
later
on
we
also
see
the
conception
of
nations
gradually
developing
in
europe
long
before
anything
like
a
state
had
grown
in
any
part
of
the
continent
occupied
by
the
barbarians
these
nations
for
it
is
impossible
to
refuse
the
name
of
a
nation
to
the
merovingian
france
or
to
the
russia
of
the
eleventh
and
twelfth
century
were
nevertheless
kept
together
by
nothing
else
but
a
community
of
language
and
a
tacit
agreement
of
the
small
republics
to
take
their
dukes
from
none
but
one
special
family
wars
were
certainly
unavoidable
migration
means
war
but
sir
henry
maine
has
already
fully
proved
in
his
remarkable
study
of
the
tribal
origin
of
international
law
that
man
has
never
been
so
ferocious
or
so
stupid
as
to
submit
to
such
an
evil
as
war
without
some
kind
of
effort
to
prevent
it
and
he
has
shown
how
exceedingly
great
is
the
number
of
ancient
institutions
which
bear
the
marks
of
a
design
to
stand
in
the
way
of
war
or
to
provide
an
alternative
to
it
in
reality
man
is
so
far
from
the
warlike
being
he
is
supposed
to
be
that
when
the
barbarians
had
once
settled
they
so
rapidly
lost
the
very
habits
of
warfare
that
very
soon
they
were
compelled
to
keep
special
dukes
followed
by
special
scholae
or
bands
of
warriors
in
order
to
protect
them
from
possible
intruders
they
preferred
peaceful
toil
to
war
the
very
peacefulness
of
man
being
the
cause
of
the
specialization
of
the
warrior
trade
which
specialization
resulted
later
on
in
serfdom
and
in
all
the
wars
of
the
states
period
of
human
history
history
finds
great
difficulties
in
restoring
to
life
the
institutions
of
the
barbarians
at
every
step
the
historian
meets
with
some
faint
indication
which
he
is
unable
to
explain
with
the
aid
of
his
own
documents
only
but
a
broad
light
is
thrown
on
the
past
as
soon
as
we
refer
to
the
institutions
of
the
very
numerous
tribes
which
are
still
living
under
a
social
organization
almost
identical
with
that
of
our
barbarian
ancestors
here
we
simply
have
the
difficulty
of
choice
because
the
islands
of
the
pacific
the
steppes
of
asia
and
the
tablelands
of
africa
are
real
historical
museums
containing
specimens
of
all
possible
intermediate
stages
which
mankind
has
lived
through
when
passing
from
the
savage
gentes
up
to
the
states
organization
let
us
then
examine
a
few
of
those
specimens
if
we
take
the
village
communities
of
the
mongol
buryates
especially
those
of
the
kudinsk
steppe
on
the
upper
lena
which
have
better
escaped
russian
influence
we
have
fair
representatives
of
barbarians
in
a
transitional
state
between
and
agriculture
these
buryates
are
still
living
in
joint
families
that
is
although
each
son
when
he
is
married
goes
to
live
in
a
separate
hut
the
huts
of
at
least
three
generations
remain
within
the
same
enclosure
and
the
joint
family
work
in
common
in
their
fields
and
own
in
common
their
joint
households
and
their
cattle
as
well
as
their
calves
grounds
small
fenced
patches
of
soil
kept
under
soft
grass
for
the
rearing
of
calves
as
a
rule
the
meals
are
taken
separately
in
each
hut
but
when
meat
is
roasted
all
the
twenty
to
sixty
members
of
the
joint
household
feast
together
several
joint
households
which
live
in
a
cluster
as
well
as
several
smaller
families
settled
in
the
same
village
mostly
debris
of
joint
households
accidentally
broken
up
make
the
oulous
or
the
village
community
several
oulouses
make
a
tribe
and
the
tribes
or
clans
of
the
kudinsk
steppe
are
united
into
one
confederation
smaller
and
closer
confederations
are
entered
into
as
necessity
arises
for
special
wants
by
several
tribes
they
know
no
private
property
in
land
the
land
being
held
in
common
by
the
oulous
or
rather
by
the
confederation
and
if
it
becomes
necessary
the
territory
is
between
the
different
oulouses
at
a
folkmote
of
the
tribe
and
between
the
tribes
at
a
folkmote
of
the
confederation
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
the
same
organization
prevails
among
all
the
buryates
of
east
siberia
although
they
have
been
for
three
centuries
under
russian
rule
and
are
well
acquainted
with
russian
institutions
with
all
that
inequalities
of
fortune
rapidly
develop
among
the
buryates
especially
since
the
russian
government
is
giving
an
exaggerated
importance
to
their
elected
taishas
princes
whom
it
considers
as
responsible
and
representatives
of
the
confederations
in
their
administrative
and
even
commercial
relations
with
the
russians
the
channels
for
the
enrichment
of
the
few
are
thus
many
while
the
impoverishment
of
the
great
number
goes
hand
in
hand
through
the
appropriation
of
the
buryate
lands
by
the
russians
but
it
is
a
habit
with
the
buryates
especially
those
of
kudinsk
and
habit
is
more
than
law
that
if
a
family
has
lost
its
cattle
the
richer
families
give
it
some
cows
and
horses
that
it
may
recover
as
to
the
destitute
man
who
has
no
family
he
takes
his
meals
in
the
huts
of
his
congeners
he
enters
a
hut
takes
by
right
not
for
charity
his
seat
by
the
fire
and
shares
the
meal
which
always
is
scrupulously
divided
into
equal
parts
he
sleeps
where
he
has
taken
his
evening
meal
altogether
the
russian
conquerors
of
siberia
were
so
much
struck
by
the
communistic
practices
of
the
buryates
that
they
gave
them
the
name
of
bratskiye
the
brotherly
ones
and
reported
to
moscow
with
them
everything
is
in
common
whatever
they
have
is
shared
in
common
even
now
when
the
lena
buryates
sell
their
wheat
or
send
some
of
their
cattle
to
be
sold
to
a
russian
butcher
the
families
of
the
oulous
or
the
tribe
put
their
wheat
and
cattle
together
and
sell
it
as
a
whole
each
oulous
has
moreover
its
grain
store
for
loans
in
case
of
need
its
communal
baking
oven
the
four
banal
of
the
old
french
communities
and
its
blacksmith
who
like
the
blacksmith
of
the
indian
communities
being
a
member
of
the
community
is
never
paid
for
his
work
within
the
community
he
must
make
it
for
nothing
and
if
he
utilizes
his
spare
time
for
fabricating
the
small
plates
of
chiselled
and
silvered
iron
which
are
used
in
buryate
land
for
the
decoration
of
dress
he
may
occasionally
sell
them
to
a
woman
from
another
clan
but
to
the
women
of
his
own
clan
the
attire
is
presented
as
a
gift
selling
and
buying
can
not
take
place
within
the
community
and
the
rule
is
so
severe
that
when
a
richer
family
hires
a
labourer
the
labourer
must
be
taken
from
another
clan
or
from
among
the
russians
this
habit
is
evidently
not
specific
to
the
buryates
it
is
so
widely
spread
among
the
modern
barbarians
aryan
and
that
it
must
have
been
universal
among
our
ancestors
the
feeling
of
union
within
the
confederation
is
kept
alive
by
the
common
interests
of
the
tribes
their
folkmotes
and
the
festivities
which
are
usually
kept
in
connection
with
the
folkmotes
the
same
feeling
is
however
maintained
by
another
institution
the
aba
or
common
hunt
which
is
a
reminiscence
of
a
very
remote
past
every
autumn
the
clans
of
kudinsk
come
together
for
such
a
hunt
the
produce
of
which
is
divided
among
all
the
families
moreover
national
abas
to
assert
the
unity
of
the
whole
buryate
nation
are
convoked
from
time
to
time
in
such
cases
all
buryate
clans
which
are
scattered
for
hundreds
of
miles
west
and
east
of
lake
baikal
are
bound
to
send
their
delegate
hunters
thousands
of
men
come
together
each
one
bringing
provisions
for
a
whole
month
every
one
share
must
be
equal
to
all
the
others
and
therefore
before
being
put
together
they
are
weighed
by
an
elected
elder
always
with
the
hand
scales
would
be
a
profanation
of
the
old
custom
after
that
the
hunters
divide
into
bands
of
twenty
and
the
parties
go
hunting
according
to
a
plan
in
such
abas
the
entire
buryate
nation
revives
its
epic
traditions
of
a
time
when
it
was
united
in
a
powerful
league
let
me
add
that
such
communal
hunts
are
quite
usual
with
the
red
indians
and
the
chinese
on
the
banks
of
the
usuri
the
kada
with
the
kabyles
whose
manners
of
life
have
been
so
well
described
by
two
french
explorers
we
have
barbarians
still
more
advanced
in
agriculture
their
fields
irrigated
and
manured
are
well
attended
to
and
in
the
hilly
tracts
every
available
plot
of
land
is
cultivated
by
the
spade
the
kabyles
have
known
many
vicissitudes
in
their
history
they
have
followed
for
sometime
the
mussulman
law
of
inheritance
but
being
adverse
to
it
they
have
returned
years
ago
to
the
tribal
customary
law
of
old
accordingly
their
is
of
a
mixed
character
and
private
property
in
land
exists
side
by
side
with
communal
possession
still
the
basis
of
their
present
organization
is
the
village
community
the
thaddart
which
usually
consists
of
several
joint
families
kharoubas
claiming
a
community
of
origin
as
well
as
of
smaller
families
of
strangers
several
villages
are
grouped
into
clans
or
tribes
arch
several
tribes
make
the
confederation
and
several
confederations
may
occasionally
enter
into
a
league
chiefly
for
purposes
of
armed
defence
the
kabyles
know
no
authority
whatever
besides
that
of
the
djemmaa
or
folkmote
of
the
village
community
all
men
of
age
take
part
in
it
in
the
open
air
or
in
a
special
building
provided
with
stone
seats
and
the
decisions
of
the
djemmaa
are
evidently
taken
at
unanimity
that
is
the
discussions
continue
until
all
present
agree
to
accept
or
to
submit
to
some
decision
there
being
no
authority
in
a
village
community
to
impose
a
decision
this
system
has
been
practised
by
mankind
wherever
there
have
been
village
communities
and
it
is
practised
still
wherever
they
continue
to
exist
by
several
hundred
million
men
all
over
the
world
the
djemmaa
nominates
its
executive
the
elder
the
scribe
and
the
treasurer
it
assesses
its
own
taxes
and
it
manages
the
repartition
of
the
common
lands
as
well
as
all
kinds
of
works
of
public
utility
a
great
deal
of
work
is
done
in
common
the
roads
the
mosques
the
fountains
the
irrigation
canals
the
towers
erected
for
protection
from
robbers
the
fences
and
so
on
are
built
by
the
village
community
while
the
the
larger
mosques
and
the
great
are
the
work
of
the
tribe
many
traces
of
common
culture
continue
to
exist
and
the
houses
continue
to
be
built
by
or
with
the
aid
of
all
men
and
women
of
the
village
altogether
the
aids
are
of
daily
occurrence
and
are
continually
called
in
for
the
cultivation
of
the
fields
for
harvesting
and
so
on
as
to
the
skilled
work
each
community
has
its
blacksmith
who
enjoys
his
part
of
the
communal
land
and
works
for
the
community
when
the
tilling
season
approaches
he
visits
every
house
and
repairs
the
tools
and
the
ploughs
without
expecting
any
pay
while
the
making
of
new
ploughs
is
considered
as
a
pious
work
which
can
by
no
means
be
recompensed
in
money
or
by
any
other
form
of
salary
as
the
kabyles
already
have
private
property
they
evidently
have
both
rich
and
poor
among
them
but
like
all
people
who
closely
live
together
and
know
how
poverty
begins
they
consider
it
as
an
accident
which
may
visit
every
one
do
say
that
you
will
never
wear
the
beggar
bag
nor
go
to
prison
is
a
proverb
of
the
russian
peasants
the
kabyles
practise
it
and
no
difference
can
be
detected
in
the
external
behaviour
between
rich
and
poor
when
the
poor
convokes
an
aid
the
rich
man
works
in
his
field
just
as
the
poor
man
does
it
reciprocally
in
his
turn
moreover
the
djemmaas
set
aside
certain
gardens
and
fields
sometimes
cultivated
in
common
for
the
use
of
the
poorest
members
many
like
customs
continue
to
exist
as
the
poorer
families
would
not
be
able
to
buy
meat
meat
is
regularly
bought
with
the
money
of
the
fines
or
the
gifts
to
the
djemmaa
or
the
payments
for
the
use
of
the
communal
basins
and
it
is
distributed
in
equal
parts
among
those
who
can
not
afford
buying
meat
themselves
and
when
a
sheep
or
a
bullock
is
killed
by
a
family
for
its
own
use
on
a
day
which
is
not
a
market
day
the
fact
is
announced
in
the
streets
by
the
village
crier
in
order
that
sick
people
and
pregnant
women
may
take
of
it
what
they
want
mutual
support
permeates
the
life
of
the
kabyles
and
if
one
of
them
during
a
journey
abroad
meets
with
another
kabyle
in
need
he
is
bound
to
come
to
his
aid
even
at
the
risk
of
his
own
fortune
and
life
if
this
has
not
been
done
the
djemmaa
of
the
man
who
has
suffered
from
such
neglect
may
lodge
a
complaint
and
the
djemmaa
of
the
selfish
man
will
at
once
make
good
the
loss
we
thus
come
across
a
custom
which
is
familiar
to
the
students
of
the
mediaeval
merchant
guilds
every
stranger
who
enters
a
kabyle
village
has
right
to
housing
in
the
winter
and
his
horses
can
always
graze
on
the
communal
lands
for
hours
but
in
case
of
need
he
can
reckon
upon
an
almost
unlimited
support
thus
during
the
famine
of
the
kabyles
received
and
fed
every
one
who
sought
refuge
in
their
villages
without
distinction
of
origin
in
the
district
of
dellys
no
less
than
people
who
came
from
all
parts
of
algeria
and
even
from
morocco
were
fed
in
this
way
while
people
died
from
starvation
all
over
algeria
there
was
not
one
single
case
of
death
due
to
this
cause
on
kabylian
soil
the
djemmaas
depriving
themselves
of
necessaries
organized
relief
without
ever
asking
any
aid
from
the
government
or
uttering
the
slightest
complaint
they
considered
it
as
a
natural
duty
and
while
among
the
european
settlers
all
kind
of
police
measures
were
taken
to
prevent
thefts
and
disorder
resulting
from
such
an
influx
of
strangers
nothing
of
the
kind
was
required
on
the
territory
the
djemmaas
needed
neither
aid
nor
protection
from
without
i
can
only
cursorily
mention
two
other
most
interesting
features
of
kabyle
life
namely
the
anaya
or
protection
granted
to
wells
canals
mosques
marketplaces
some
roads
and
so
on
in
case
of
war
and
the
cofs
in
the
anaya
we
have
a
series
of
institutions
both
for
diminishing
the
evils
of
war
and
for
preventing
conflicts
thus
the
is
anaya
especially
if
it
stands
on
a
frontier
and
brings
kabyles
and
strangers
together
no
one
dares
disturb
peace
in
the
market
and
if
a
disturbance
arises
it
is
quelled
at
once
by
the
strangers
who
have
gathered
in
the
market
town
the
road
upon
which
the
women
go
from
the
village
to
the
fountain
also
is
anaya
in
case
of
war
and
so
on
as
to
the
cof
it
is
a
widely
spread
form
of
association
having
some
characters
of
the
mediaeval
burgschaften
or
gegilden
as
well
as
of
societies
both
for
mutual
protection
and
for
various
purposes
intellectual
political
and
emotional
which
can
not
be
satisfied
by
the
territorial
organization
of
the
village
the
clan
and
the
con
federation
the
cof
knows
no
territorial
limits
it
recruits
its
members
in
various
villages
even
among
strangers
and
it
protects
them
in
all
possible
eventualities
of
life
altogether
it
is
an
attempt
at
supplementing
the
territorial
grouping
by
an
grouping
intended
to
give
an
expression
to
mutual
affinities
of
all
kinds
across
the
frontiers
the
free
international
association
of
individual
tastes
and
ideas
which
we
consider
as
one
of
the
best
features
of
our
own
life
has
thus
its
origin
in
barbarian
antiquity
the
mountaineers
of
caucasia
offer
another
extremely
instructive
field
for
illustrations
of
the
same
kind
in
studying
the
present
customs
of
the
ossetes
their
joint
families
and
communes
and
their
judiciary
conceptions
professor
kovalevsky
in
a
remarkable
work
on
modern
custom
and
ancient
law
was
enabled
step
by
step
to
trace
the
similar
dispositions
of
the
old
barbarian
codes
and
even
to
study
the
origins
of
feudalism
with
other
caucasian
stems
we
occasionally
catch
a
glimpse
into
the
origin
of
the
village
community
in
those
cases
where
it
was
not
tribal
but
originated
from
a
voluntary
union
between
families
of
distinct
origin
such
was
recently
the
case
with
some
khevsoure
villages
the
inhabitants
of
which
took
the
oath
of
community
and
fraternity
in
another
part
of
caucasus
daghestan
we
see
the
growth
of
feudal
relations
between
two
tribes
both
maintaining
at
the
same
time
their
village
communities
and
even
traces
of
the
gentile
classes
and
thus
giving
a
living
illustration
of
the
forms
taken
by
the
conquest
of
italy
and
gaul
by
the
barbarians
the
victorious
race
the
lezghines
who
have
conquered
several
georgian
and
tartar
villages
in
the
zakataly
district
did
not
bring
them
under
the
dominion
of
separate
families
they
constituted
a
feudal
clan
which
now
includes
households
in
three
villages
and
owns
in
common
no
less
than
twenty
georgian
and
tartar
villages
the
conquerors
divided
their
own
land
among
their
clans
and
the
clans
divided
it
in
equal
parts
among
the
families
but
they
did
not
interfere
with
the
djemmaas
of
their
tributaries
which
still
practise
the
habit
mentioned
by
julius
caesar
namely
the
djemmaa
decides
each
year
which
part
of
the
communal
territory
must
be
cultivated
and
this
land
is
divided
into
as
many
parts
as
there
are
families
and
the
parts
are
distributed
by
lot
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
although
proletarians
are
of
common
occurrence
among
the
lezghines
who
live
under
a
system
of
private
property
in
land
and
common
ownership
of
serfs
they
are
rare
among
their
georgian
serfs
who
continue
to
hold
their
land
in
common
as
to
the
customary
law
of
the
caucasian
mountaineers
it
is
much
the
same
as
that
of
the
longobards
or
salic
franks
and
several
of
its
dispositions
explain
a
good
deal
the
judicial
procedure
of
the
barbarians
of
old
being
of
a
very
impressionable
character
they
do
their
best
to
prevent
quarrels
from
taking
a
fatal
issue
so
with
the
khevsoures
the
swords
are
very
soon
drawn
when
a
quarrel
breaks
out
but
if
a
woman
rushes
out
and
throws
among
them
the
piece
of
linen
which
she
wears
on
her
head
the
swords
are
at
once
returned
to
their
sheaths
and
the
quarrel
is
appeased
the
of
the
women
is
anaya
if
a
quarrel
has
not
been
stopped
in
time
and
has
ended
in
murder
the
compensation
money
is
so
considerable
that
the
aggressor
is
entirely
ruined
for
his
life
unless
he
is
adopted
by
the
wronged
family
and
if
he
has
resorted
to
his
sword
in
a
trifling
quarrel
and
has
inflicted
wounds
he
loses
for
ever
the
consideration
of
his
kin
in
all
disputes
mediators
take
the
matter
in
hand
they
select
from
among
the
members
of
the
clan
the
judges
six
in
smaller
affairs
and
from
ten
to
fifteen
in
more
serious
matters
and
russian
observers
testify
to
the
absolute
incorruptibility
of
the
judges
an
oath
has
such
a
significance
that
men
enjoying
general
esteem
are
dispensed
from
taking
it
a
simple
affirmation
is
quite
sufficient
the
more
so
as
in
grave
affairs
the
khevsoure
never
hesitates
to
recognize
his
guilt
i
mean
of
course
the
khevsoure
untouched
yet
by
civilization
the
oath
is
chiefly
reserved
for
such
cases
like
disputes
about
property
which
require
some
sort
of
appreciation
in
addition
to
a
simple
statement
of
facts
and
in
such
cases
the
men
whose
affirmation
will
decide
in
the
dispute
act
with
the
greatest
circumspection
altogether
it
is
certainly
not
a
want
of
honesty
or
of
respect
to
the
rights
of
the
congeners
which
characterizes
the
barbarian
societies
of
caucasus
the
stems
of
africa
offer
such
an
immense
variety
of
extremely
interesting
societies
standing
at
all
intermediate
stages
from
the
early
village
community
to
the
despotic
barbarian
monarchies
that
i
must
abandon
the
idea
of
giving
here
even
the
chief
results
of
a
comparative
study
of
their
institutions
suffice
it
to
say
that
even
under
the
most
horrid
despotism
of
kings
the
folkmotes
of
the
village
communities
and
their
customary
law
remain
sovereign
in
a
wide
circle
of
affairs
the
law
of
the
state
allows
the
king
to
take
any
one
life
for
a
simple
caprice
or
even
for
simply
satisfying
his
gluttony
but
the
customary
law
of
the
people
continues
to
maintain
the
same
network
of
institutions
for
mutual
support
which
exist
among
other
barbarians
or
have
existed
among
our
ancestors
and
with
some
stems
in
bornu
uganda
abyssinia
and
especially
the
bogos
some
of
the
dispositions
of
the
customary
law
are
inspired
with
really
graceful
and
delicate
feelings
the
village
communities
of
the
natives
of
both
americas
have
the
same
character
the
tupi
of
brazil
were
found
living
in
long
houses
occupied
by
whole
clans
which
used
to
cultivate
their
corn
and
manioc
fields
in
common
the
arani
much
more
advanced
in
civilization
used
to
cultivate
their
fields
in
common
so
also
the
oucagas
who
had
learned
under
their
system
of
primitive
communism
and
long
houses
to
build
good
roads
and
to
carry
on
a
variety
of
domestic
industries
not
inferior
to
those
of
the
early
medieval
times
in
europe
all
of
them
were
also
living
under
the
same
customary
law
of
which
we
have
given
specimens
on
the
preceding
pages
at
another
extremity
of
the
world
we
find
the
malayan
feudalism
but
this
feudalism
has
been
powerless
to
unroot
the
negaria
or
village
community
with
its
common
ownership
of
at
least
part
of
the
land
and
the
redistribution
of
land
among
the
several
negarias
of
the
tribe
with
the
alfurus
of
minahasa
we
find
the
communal
rotation
of
the
crops
with
the
indian
stem
of
the
wyandots
we
have
the
periodical
redistribution
of
land
within
the
tribe
and
the
of
the
soil
and
in
all
those
parts
of
sumatra
where
moslem
institutions
have
not
yet
totally
destroyed
the
old
organization
we
find
the
joint
family
suka
and
the
village
community
kota
which
maintains
its
right
upon
the
land
even
if
part
of
it
has
been
cleared
without
its
authorization
but
to
say
this
is
to
say
that
all
customs
for
mutual
protection
and
prevention
of
feuds
and
wars
which
have
been
briefly
indicated
in
the
preceding
pages
as
characteristic
of
the
village
community
exist
as
well
more
than
that
the
more
fully
the
communal
possession
of
land
has
been
maintained
the
better
and
the
gentler
are
the
habits
de
stuers
positively
affirms
that
wherever
the
institution
of
the
village
community
has
been
less
encroached
upon
by
the
conquerors
the
inequalities
of
fortunes
are
smaller
and
the
very
prescriptions
of
the
lex
talionis
are
less
cruel
while
on
the
contrary
wherever
the
village
community
has
been
totally
broken
up
the
inhabitants
suffer
the
most
unbearable
oppression
from
their
despotic
rulers
this
is
quite
natural
and
when
waitz
made
the
remark
that
those
stems
which
have
maintained
their
tribal
confederations
stand
on
a
higher
level
of
development
and
have
a
richer
literature
than
those
stems
which
have
forfeited
the
old
bonds
of
union
he
only
pointed
out
what
might
have
been
foretold
in
advance
more
illustrations
would
simply
involve
me
in
tedious
repetitions
so
strikingly
similar
are
the
barbarian
societies
under
all
climates
and
amidst
all
races
the
same
process
of
evolution
has
been
going
on
in
mankind
with
a
wonderful
similarity
when
the
clan
organization
assailed
as
it
was
from
within
by
the
separate
family
and
from
without
by
the
dismemberment
of
the
migrating
clans
and
the
necessity
of
taking
in
strangers
of
different
descent
the
village
community
based
upon
a
territorial
conception
came
into
existence
this
new
institution
which
had
naturally
grown
out
of
the
preceding
one
the
clan
permitted
the
barbarians
to
pass
through
a
most
disturbed
period
of
history
without
being
broken
into
isolated
families
which
would
have
succumbed
in
the
struggle
for
life
new
forms
of
culture
developed
under
the
new
organization
agriculture
attained
the
stage
which
it
hardly
has
surpassed
until
now
with
the
great
number
the
domestic
industries
reached
a
high
degree
of
perfection
the
wilderness
was
conquered
it
was
intersected
by
roads
dotted
with
swarms
thrown
off
by
the
markets
and
fortified
centres
as
well
as
places
of
public
worship
were
erected
the
conceptions
of
a
wider
union
extended
to
whole
stems
and
to
several
stems
of
various
origin
were
slowly
elaborated
the
old
conceptions
of
justice
which
were
conceptions
of
mere
revenge
slowly
underwent
a
deep
modification
the
idea
of
amends
for
the
wrong
done
taking
the
place
of
revenge
the
customary
law
which
still
makes
the
law
of
the
daily
life
for
or
more
of
mankind
was
elaborated
under
that
organization
as
well
as
a
system
of
habits
intended
to
prevent
the
oppression
of
the
masses
by
the
minorities
whose
powers
grew
in
proportion
to
the
growing
facilities
for
private
accumulation
of
wealth
this
was
the
new
form
taken
by
the
tendencies
of
the
masses
for
mutual
support
and
the
progress
economical
intellectual
and
moral
which
mankind
accomplished
under
this
new
popular
form
of
organization
was
so
great
that
the
states
when
they
were
called
later
on
into
existence
simply
took
possession
in
the
interest
of
the
minorities
of
all
the
judicial
economical
and
administrative
functions
which
the
village
community
already
had
exercised
in
the
interest
of
all
notes
numberless
traces
of
lakes
now
disappeared
are
found
over
central
west
and
north
asia
shells
of
the
same
species
as
those
now
found
in
the
caspian
sea
are
scattered
over
the

far
east

deduction
must
surely
be
made
for
temporary
periodical
oscillations
but
with
all
that
desiccation
is
evident
and
it
progresses
at
a
formerly
unexpected
speed
even
in
the
relatively
wet
parts
of
siberia
the
succession
of
reliable
surveys
recently
published
by
yadrintseff
shows
that
villages
have
grown
up
on
what
was
eighty
years
ago
the
bottom
of
one
of
the
lakes
of
the
tchany
group
while
the
other
lakes
of
the
same
group
which
covered
hundreds
of
square
miles
some
fifty
years
ago
are
now
mere
ponds
in
short
the
desiccation
of
asia
goes
on
at
a
rate
which
must
be
measured
by
centuries
instead
of
by
the
geological
units
of
time
of
which
we
formerly
used
to
speak
whole
civilizations
had
thus
disappeared
as
is
proved
now
by
the
remarkable
discoveries
in
mongolia
on

not

the

it
is
not
only
because
of
the
deep

of
views
of

three
writers
but
also
on
account
of

altogether
a

the
want

much
felt

several
authorities
are
inclined
to
consider
the
joint
household
as
an
intermediate
stage
between
the
clan
and
the
village
community
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
in
very
many
cases
village
communities
have
grown
up
out
of
undivided
families
nevertheless
i
consider
the
joint
household
as
a
fact
of
a
different
order
we
find
it
within
the
gentes
on
the
other
hand
we
can
not
affirm
that
joint
families
have
existed
at
any
period
without
belonging
either
to
a
gens
or
to
a
village
community
or
to
a
gau
i
conceive
the
early
village
communities
as
slowly
originating
directly
from
the
gentes
and
consisting
according
to
racial
and
local
circumstances
either
of
several
joint
families
or
of
both
joint
and
simple
families
or
especially
in
the
case
of

of
simple
families

on
the

modern
research
as
we
saw
it
in
the
two
preceding
chapters
proves
that
since
the
very
beginning
of
their
prehistoric
life
men
used
to
agglomerate
into
gentes
clans
or
tribes
maintained
by
an
idea
of
common
descent
and
by
worship
of
common
ancestors
for
thousands
and
thousands
of
years
this
organization
has
kept
men
together
even
though
there
was
no
authority
whatever
to
impose
it
it
has
deeply
impressed
all
subsequent
development
of
mankind
and
when
the
bonds
of
common
descent
had
been
loosened
by
migrations
on
a
grand
scale
while
the
development
of
the
separated
family
within
the
clan
itself
had
destroyed
the
old
unity
of
the
clan
a
new
form
of
union
territorial
in
its
principle
the
village
community
was
called
into
existence
by
the
social
genius
of
man
this
institution
again
kept
men
together
for
a
number
of
centuries
permitting
them
to
further
develop
their
social
institutions
and
to
pass
through
some
of
the
darkest
periods
of
history
without
being
dissolved
into
loose
aggregations
of
families
and
individuals
to
make
a
further
step
in
their
evolution
and
to
work
out
a
number
of
secondary
social
institutions
several
of
which
have
survived
down
to
the
present
time
we
have
now
to
follow
the
further
developments
of
the
same
tendency
for
mutual
aid
taking
the
village
communities
of
the
barbarians
at
a
time
when
they
were
making
a
new
start
of
civilization
after
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
we
have
to
study
the
new
aspects
taken
by
the
sociable
wants
of
the
masses
in
the
middle
ages
and
especially
in
the
medieval
guilds
and
the
medieval
city
far
from
being
the
fighting
animals
they
have
often
been
compared
to
the
barbarians
of
the
first
centuries
of
our
era
like
so
many
mongolians
africans
arabs
and
so
on
who
still
continue
in
the
same
barbarian
stage
invariably
preferred
peace
to
war
with
the
exception
of
a
few
tribes
which
had
been
driven
during
the
great
migrations
into
unproductive
deserts
or
highlands
and
were
thus
compelled
periodically
to
prey
upon
their
neighbours
apart
from
these
the
great
bulk
of
the
teutons
the
saxons
the
celts
the
slavonians
and
so
on
very
soon
after
they
had
settled
in
their
abodes
reverted
to
the
spade
or
to
their
herds
the
earliest
barbarian
codes
already
represent
to
us
societies
composed
of
peaceful
agricultural
communities
not
hordes
of
men
at
war
with
each
other
these
barbarians
covered
the
country
with
villages
and
farmhouses
they
cleared
the
forests
bridged
the
torrents
and
colonized
the
formerly
quite
uninhabited
wilderness
and
they
left
the
uncertain
warlike
pursuits
to
brotherhoods
scholae
or
trusts
of
unruly
men
gathered
round
temporary
chieftains
who
wandered
about
offering
their
adventurous
spirit
their
arms
and
their
knowledge
of
warfare
for
the
protection
of
populations
only
too
anxious
to
be
left
in
peace
the
warrior
bands
came
and
went
prosecuting
their
family
feuds
but
the
great
mass
continued
to
till
the
soil
taking
but
little
notice
of
their
rulers
so
long
as
they
did
not
interfere
with
the
independence
of
their
village
communities
the
new
occupiers
of
europe
evolved
the
systems
of
land
tenure
and
soil
culture
which
are
still
in
force
with
hundreds
of
millions
of
men
they
worked
out
their
systems
of
compensation
for
wrongs
instead
of
the
old
tribal
they
learned
the
first
rudiments
of
industry
and
while
they
fortified
their
villages
with
palisaded
walls
or
erected
towers
and
earthen
forts
whereto
to
repair
in
case
of
a
new
invasion
they
soon
abandoned
the
task
of
defending
these
towers
and
forts
to
those
who
made
of
war
a
speciality
the
very
peacefulness
of
the
barbarians
certainly
not
their
supposed
warlike
instincts
thus
became
the
source
of
their
subsequent
subjection
to
the
military
chieftains
it
is
evident
that
the
very
mode
of
life
of
the
armed
brotherhoods
offered
them
more
facilities
for
enrichment
than
the
tillers
of
the
soil
could
find
in
their
agricultural
communities
even
now
we
see
that
armed
men
occasionally
come
together
to
shoot
down
matabeles
and
to
rob
them
of
their
droves
of
cattle
though
the
matabeles
only
want
peace
and
are
ready
to
buy
it
at
a
high
price
the
scholae
of
old
certainly
were
not
more
scrupulous
than
the
scholae
of
our
own
time
droves
of
cattle
iron
which
was
extremely
costly
at
that
time
and
slaves
were
appropriated
in
this
way
and
although
most
acquisitions
were
wasted
on
the
spot
in
those
glorious
feasts
of
which
epic
poetry
has
so
much
to
say
still
some
part
of
the
robbed
riches
was
used
for
further
enrichment
there
was
plenty
of
waste
land
and
no
lack
of
men
ready
to
till
it
if
only
they
could
obtain
the
necessary
cattle
and
implements
whole
villages
ruined
by
murrains
pests
fires
or
raids
of
new
immigrants
were
often
abandoned
by
their
inhabitants
who
went
anywhere
in
search
of
new
abodes
they
still
do
so
in
russia
in
similar
circumstances
and
if
one
of
the
hirdmen
of
the
armed
brotherhoods
offered
the
peasants
some
cattle
for
a
fresh
start
some
iron
to
make
a
plough
if
not
the
plough
itself
his
protection
from
further
raids
and
a
number
of
years
free
from
all
obligations
before
they
should
begin
to
repay
the
contracted
debt
they
settled
upon
the
land
and
when
after
a
hard
fight
with
bad
crops
inundations
and
pestilences
those
pioneers
began
to
repay
their
debts
they
fell
into
servile
obligations
towards
the
protector
of
the
territory
wealth
undoubtedly
did
accumulate
in
this
way
and
power
always
follows
wealth
and
yet
the
more
we
penetrate
into
the
life
of
those
times
the
sixth
and
seventh
centuries
of
our
era
the
more
we
see
that
another
element
besides
wealth
and
military
force
was
required
to
constitute
the
authority
of
the
few
it
was
an
element
of
law
and
tight
a
desire
of
the
masses
to
maintain
peace
and
to
establish
what
they
considered
to
be
justice
which
gave
to
the
chieftains
of
the
scholae
kings
dukes
knyazes
and
the
like
the
force
they
acquired
two
or
three
hundred
years
later
that
same
idea
of
justice
conceived
as
an
adequate
revenge
for
the
wrong
done
which
had
grown
in
the
tribal
stage
now
passed
as
a
red
thread
through
the
history
of
subsequent
institutions
and
much
more
even
than
military
or
economic
causes
it
became
the
basis
upon
which
the
authority
of
the
kings
and
the
feudal
lords
was
founded
in
fact
one
of
the
chief
preoccupations
of
the
barbarian
village
community
always
was
as
it
still
is
with
our
barbarian
contemporaries
to
put
a
speedy
end
to
the
feuds
which
arose
from
the
then
current
conception
of
justice
when
a
quarrel
took
place
the
community
at
once
interfered
and
after
the
folkmote
had
heard
the
case
it
settled
the
amount
of
composition
wergeld
to
be
paid
to
the
wronged
person
or
to
his
family
as
well
as
the
fred
or
fine
for
breach
of
peace
which
had
to
be
paid
to
the
community
interior
quarrels
were
easily
appeased
in
this
way
but
when
feuds
broke
out
between
two
different
tribes
or
two
confederations
of
tribes
notwithstanding
all
measures
taken
to
prevent
them
the
difficulty
was
to
find
an
arbiter
or
whose
decision
should
be
accepted
by
both
parties
alike
both
for
his
impartiality
and
for
his
knowledge
of
the
oldest
law
the
difficulty
was
the
greater
as
the
customary
laws
of
different
tribes
and
confederations
were
at
variance
as
to
the
compensation
due
in
different
cases
it
therefore
became
habitual
to
take
the
from
among
such
families
or
such
tribes
as
were
reputed
for
keeping
the
law
of
old
in
its
purity
of
being
versed
in
the
songs
triads
sagas
by
means
of
which
law
was
perpetuated
in
memory
and
to
retain
law
in
this
way
became
a
sort
of
art
a
mystery
carefully
transmitted
in
certain
families
from
generation
to
generation
thus
in
iceland
and
in
other
scandinavian
lands
at
every
or
national
folkmote
a
l√∂vs√∂gmathr
used
to
recite
the
whole
law
from
memory
for
the
enlightening
of
the
assembly
and
in
ireland
there
was
as
is
known
a
special
class
of
men
reputed
for
the
knowledge
of
the
old
traditions
and
therefore
enjoying
a
great
authority
as
judges
again
when
we
are
told
by
the
russian
annals
that
some
stems
of
russia
moved
by
the
growing
disorder
which
resulted
from
clans
rising
against
clans
appealed
to
norman
varingiar
to
be
their
judges
and
commanders
of
warrior
scholae
and
when
we
see
the
knyazes
or
dukes
elected
for
the
next
two
hundred
years
always
from
the
same
norman
family
we
can
not
but
recognize
that
the
slavonians
trusted
to
the
normans
for
a
better
knowledge
of
the
law
which
would
be
equally
recognized
as
good
by
different
slavonian
kins
in
this
case
the
possession
of
runes
used
for
the
transmission
of
old
customs
was
a
decided
advantage
in
favour
of
the
normans
but
in
other
cases
there
are
faint
indications
that
the
eldest
branch
of
the
stem
the
supposed
motherbranch
was
appealed
to
to
supply
the
judges
and
its
decisions
were
relied
upon
as
just
while
at
a
later
epoch
we
see
a
distinct
tendency
towards
taking
the
from
the
christian
clergy
which
at
that
time
kept
still
to
the
fundamental
now
forgotten
principle
of
christianity
that
retaliation
is
no
act
of
justice
at
that
time
the
christian
clergy
opened
the
churches
as
places
of
asylum
for
those
who
fled
from
blood
revenge
and
they
willingly
acted
as
arbiters
in
criminal
cases
always
opposing
the
old
tribal
principle
of
life
for
life
and
wound
for
wound
in
short
the
deeper
we
penetrate
into
the
history
of
early
institutions
the
less
we
find
grounds
for
the
military
theory
of
origin
of
authority
even
that
power
which
later
on
became
such
a
source
of
oppression
seems
on
the
contrary
to
have
found
its
origin
in
the
peaceful
inclinations
of
the
masses
in
all
these
cases
the
fred
which
often
amounted
to
half
the
compensation
went
to
the
folkmote
and
from
times
immemorial
it
used
to
be
applied
to
works
of
common
utility
and
defence
it
has
still
the
same
destination
the
erection
of
towers
among
the
kabyles
and
certain
mongolian
stems
and
we
have
direct
evidence
that
even
several
centuries
later
the
judicial
fines
in
pskov
and
several
french
and
german
cities
continued
to
be
used
for
the
repair
of
the
city
walls
it
was
thus
quite
natural
that
the
fines
should
be
handed
over
to
the
who
was
bound
in
return
both
to
maintain
the
schola
of
armed
men
to
whom
the
defence
of
the
territory
was
trusted
and
to
execute
the
sentences
this
became
a
universal
custom
in
the
eighth
and
ninth
centuries
even
when
the
was
an
elected
bishop
the
germ
of
a
combination
of
what
we
should
now
call
the
judicial
power
and
the
executive
thus
made
its
appearance
but
to
these
two
functions
the
attributions
of
the
duke
or
king
were
strictly
limited
he
was
no
ruler
of
the
people
the
supreme
power
still
belonging
to
the
folkmote
not
even
a
commander
of
the
popular
militia
when
the
folk
took
to
arms
it
marched
under
a
separate
also
elected
commander
who
was
not
a
subordinate
but
an
equal
to
the
king
the
king
was
a
lord
on
his
personal
domain
only
in
fact
in
barbarian
language
the
word
konung
koning
or
cyning
synonymous
with
the
latin
rex
had
no
other
meaning
than
that
of
a
temporary
leader
or
chieftain
of
a
band
of
men
the
commander
of
a
flotilla
of
boats
or
even
of
a
single
pirate
boat
was
also
a
konung
and
till
the
present
day
the
commander
of
fishing
in
norway
is
named
the
king
of
the
nets
the
veneration
attached
later
on
to
the
personality
of
a
king
did
not
yet
exist
and
while
treason
to
the
kin
was
punished
by
death
the
slaying
of
a
king
could
be
recouped
by
the
payment
of
compensation
a
king
simply
was
valued
so
much
more
than
a
freeman
and
when
king
knu
or
canute
had
killed
one
man
of
his
own
schola
the
saga
represents
him
convoking
his
comrades
to
a
thing
where
he
stood
on
his
knees
imploring
pardon
he
was
pardoned
but
not
till
he
had
agreed
to
pay
nine
times
the
regular
composition
of
which
went
to
himself
for
the
loss
of
one
of
his
men
to
the
relatives
of
the
slain
man
and
the
fred
to
the
schola
in
reality
a
complete
change
had
to
be
accomplished
in
the
current
conceptions
under
the
double
influence
of
the
church
and
the
students
of
roman
law
before
an
idea
of
sanctity
began
to
be
attached
to
the
personality
of
the
king
however
it
lies
beyond
the
scope
of
these
essays
to
follow
the
gradual
development
of
authority
out
of
the
elements
just
indicated
historians
such
as
and
green
for
this
country
augustin
thierry
michelet
and
luchaire
for
france
kaufmann
janssen
arnold
and
even
nitzsch
for
germany
leo
and
botta
for
italy
byelaeff
kostomaroff
and
their
followers
for
russia
and
many
others
have
fully
told
that
tale
they
have
shown
how
populations
once
free
and
simply
agreeing
to
feed
a
certain
portion
of
their
military
defenders
gradually
became
the
serfs
of
these
protectors
how
commendation
to
the
church
or
to
a
lord
became
a
hard
necessity
for
the
freeman
how
each
lord
and
castle
became
a
robber
nest
how
feudalism
was
imposed
in
a
word
and
how
the
crusades
by
freeing
the
serfs
who
wore
the
cross
gave
the
first
impulse
to
popular
emancipation
all
this
need
not
be
retold
in
this
place
our
chief
aim
being
to
follow
the
constructive
genius
of
the
masses
in
their
institutions
at
a
time
when
the
last
vestiges
of
barbarian
freedom
seemed
to
disappear
and
europe
fallen
under
the
dominion
of
thousands
of
petty
rulers
was
marching
towards
the
constitution
of
such
theocracies
and
despotic
states
as
had
followed
the
barbarian
stage
during
the
previous
starts
of
civilization
or
of
barbarian
monarchies
such
as
we
see
now
in
africa
life
in
europe
took
another
direction
it
went
on
on
lines
similar
to
those
it
had
once
taken
in
the
cities
of
antique
greece
with
a
unanimity
which
seems
almost
incomprehensible
and
for
a
long
time
was
not
understood
by
historians
the
urban
agglomerations
down
to
the
smallest
burgs
began
to
shake
off
the
yoke
of
their
worldly
and
clerical
lords
the
fortified
village
rose
against
the
lord
castle
defied
it
first
attacked
it
next
and
finally
destroyed
it
the
movement
spread
from
spot
to
spot
involving
every
town
on
the
surface
of
europe
and
in
less
than
a
hundred
years
free
cities
had
been
called
into
existence
on
the
coasts
of
the
mediterranean
the
north
sea
the
baltic
the
atlantic
ocean
down
to
the
fjords
of
scandinavia
at
the
feet
of
the
apennines
the
alps
the
black
forest
the
grampians
and
the
carpathians
in
the
plains
of
russia
hungary
france
and
spain
everywhere
the
same
revolt
took
place
with
the
same
features
passing
through
the
same
phases
leading
to
the
same
results
wherever
men
had
found
or
expected
to
find
some
protection
behind
their
town
walls
they
instituted
their
their
fraternities
their
friendships
united
in
one
common
idea
and
boldly
marching
towards
a
new
life
of
mutual
support
and
liberty
and
they
succeeded
so
well
that
in
three
or
four
hundred
years
they
had
changed
the
very
face
of
europe
they
had
covered
the
country
with
beautiful
sumptuous
buildings
expressing
the
genius
of
free
unions
of
free
men
unrivalled
since
for
their
beauty
and
expressiveness
and
they
bequeathed
to
the
following
generations
all
the
arts
all
the
industries
of
which
our
present
civilization
with
all
its
achievements
and
promises
for
the
future
is
only
a
further
development
and
when
we
now
look
to
the
forces
which
have
produced
these
grand
results
we
find
them
not
in
the
genius
of
individual
heroes
not
in
the
mighty
organization
of
huge
states
or
the
political
capacities
of
their
rulers
but
in
the
very
same
current
of
mutual
aid
and
support
which
we
saw
at
work
in
the
village
community
and
which
was
vivified
and
reinforced
in
the
middle
ages
by
a
new
form
of
unions
inspired
by
the
very
same
spirit
but
shaped
on
a
new
model
the
guilds
it
is
well
known
by
this
time
that
feudalism
did
not
imply
a
dissolution
of
the
village
community
although
the
lord
had
succeeded
in
imposing
servile
labour
upon
the
peasants
and
had
appropriated
for
himself
such
rights
as
were
formerly
vested
in
the
village
community
alone
taxes
mortmain
duties
on
inheritances
and
marriages
the
peasants
had
nevertheless
maintained
the
two
fundamental
rights
of
their
communities
the
common
possession
of
the
land
and
in
olden
times
when
a
king
sent
his
vogt
to
a
village
the
peasants
received
him
with
flowers
in
one
hand
and
arms
in
the
other
and
asked
him
which
law
he
intended
to
apply
the
one
he
found
in
the
village
or
the
one
he
brought
with
him
and
in
the
first
case
they
handed
him
the
flowers
and
accepted
him
while
in
the
second
case
they
fought
him
now
they
accepted
the
king
or
the
lord
official
whom
they
could
not
refuse
but
they
maintained
the
folkmote
jurisdiction
and
themselves
nominated
six
seven
or
twelve
judges
who
acted
with
the
lord
judge
in
the
presence
of
the
folkmote
as
arbiters
and
in
most
cases
the
official
had
nothing
left
to
him
but
to
confirm
the
sentence
and
to
levy
the
customary
fred
this
precious
right
of
which
at
that
time
meant
and
had
been
maintained
through
all
the
struggles
and
even
the
lawyers
by
whom
karl
the
great
was
surrounded
could
not
abolish
it
they
were
bound
to
confirm
it
at
the
same
time
in
all
matters
concerning
the
community
domain
the
folkmote
retained
its
supremacy
and
as
shown
by
maurer
often
claimed
submission
from
the
lord
himself
in
land
tenure
matters
no
growth
of
feudalism
could
break
this
resistance
the
village
community
kept
its
ground
and
when
in
the
ninth
and
tenth
centuries
the
invasions
of
the
normans
the
arabs
and
the
ugrians
had
demonstrated
that
military
scholae
were
of
little
value
for
protecting
the
land
a
general
movement
began
all
over
europe
for
fortifying
the
villages
with
stone
walls
and
citadels
thousands
of
fortified
centres
were
then
built
by
the
energies
of
the
village
communities
and
once
they
had
built
their
walls
once
a
common
interest
had
been
created
in
this
new
sanctuary
the
town
walls
they
soon
understood
that
they
could
henceforward
resist
the
encroachments
of
the
inner
enemies
the
lords
as
well
as
the
invasions
of
foreigners
a
new
life
of
freedom
began
to
develop
within
the
fortified
enclosures
the
medieval
city
was
born
no
period
of
history
could
better
illustrate
the
constructive
powers
of
the
popular
masses
than
the
tenth
and
eleventh
centuries
when
the
fortified
villages
and
representing
so
many
oases
amidst
the
feudal
forest
began
to
free
themselves
from
their
lord
yoke
and
slowly
elaborated
the
future
city
organization
but
unhappily
this
is
a
period
about
which
historical
information
is
especially
scarce
we
know
the
results
but
little
has
reached
us
about
the
means
by
which
they
were
achieved
under
the
protection
of
their
walls
the
folkmotes
either
quite
independent
or
led
by
the
chief
noble
or
merchant
families
conquered
and
maintained
the
right
of
electing
the
military
defensor
and
supreme
judge
of
the
town
or
at
least
of
choosing
between
those
who
pretended
to
occupy
this
position
in
italy
the
young
communes
were
continually
sending
away
their
defensors
or
domini
fighting
those
who
refused
to
go
the
same
went
on
in
the
east
in
bohemia
rich
and
poor
alike
bohemicae
gentis
magni
et
parvi
nobiles
et
ignobiles
took
part
in
the
election
while
the
vyeches
folkmotes
of
the
russian
cities
regularly
elected
their
dukes
always
from
the
same
rurik
family
covenanted
with
them
and
sent
the
knyaz
away
if
he
had
provoked
discontent
at
the
same
time
in
most
cities
of
western
and
southern
europe
the
tendency
was
to
take
for
defensor
a
bishop
whom
the
city
had
elected
itself
and
so
many
bishops
took
the
lead
in
protecting
the
immunities
of
the
towns
and
in
defending
their
liberties
that
numbers
of
them
were
considered
after
their
death
as
saints
and
special
patrons
of
different
cities
uthelred
of
winchester
ulrik
of
augsburg
wolfgang
of
ratisbon
heribert
of
cologne
adalbert
of
prague
and
so
on
as
well
as
many
abbots
and
monks
became
so
many
cities
saints
for
having
acted
in
defence
of
popular
rights
and
under
the
new
defensors
whether
laic
or
clerical
the
citizens
conquered
full
and
for
their
folkmotes
the
whole
process
of
liberation
progressed
by
a
series
of
imperceptible
acts
of
devotion
to
the
common
cause
accomplished
by
men
who
came
out
of
the
masses
by
unknown
heroes
whose
very
names
have
not
been
preserved
by
history
the
wonderful
movement
of
the
god
peace
treuga
dei
by
which
the
popular
masses
endeavoured
to
put
a
limit
to
the
endless
family
feuds
of
the
noble
families
was
born
in
the
young
towns
the
bishops
and
the
citizens
trying
to
extend
to
the
nobles
the
peace
they
had
established
within
their
town
walls
already
at
that
period
the
commercial
cities
of
italy
and
especially
amalfi
which
had
its
elected
consuls
since
and
frequently
changed
its
doges
in
the
tenth
century
worked
out
the
customary
maritime
and
commercial
law
which
later
on
became
a
model
for
all
europe
ravenna
elaborated
its
craft
organization
and
milan
which
had
made
its
first
revolution
in
became
a
great
centre
of
commerce
its
trades
enjoying
a
full
independence
since
the
eleventh
century
so
also
brugge
and
ghent
so
also
several
cities
of
france
in
which
the
mahl
or
forum
had
become
a
quite
independent
institution
and
already
during
that
period
began
the
work
of
artistic
decoration
of
the
towns
by
works
of
architecture
which
we
still
admire
and
which
loudly
testify
of
the
intellectual
movement
of
the
times
the
basilicae
were
then
renewed
in
almost
all
the
universe
raoul
glaber
wrote
in
his
chronicle
and
some
of
the
finest
monuments
of
medieval
architecture
date
from
that
period
the
wonderful
old
church
of
bremen
was
built
in
the
ninth
century
saint
marc
of
venice
was
finished
in
and
the
beautiful
dome
of
pisa
in
in
fact
the
intellectual
movement
which
has
been
described
as
the
twelfth
century
renaissance
and
the
twelfth
century
rationalism
the
precursor
of
the
reform
date
from
that
period
when
most
cities
were
still
simple
agglomerations
of
small
village
communities
enclosed
by
walls
however
another
element
besides
the
principle
was
required
to
give
to
these
growing
centres
of
liberty
and
enlightenment
the
unity
of
thought
and
action
and
the
powers
of
initiative
which
made
their
force
in
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
with
the
growing
diversity
of
occupations
crafts
and
arts
and
with
the
growing
commerce
in
distant
lands
some
new
form
of
union
was
required
and
this
necessary
new
element
was
supplied
by
the
guilds
volumes
and
volumes
have
been
written
about
these
unions
which
under
the
name
of
guilds
brotherhoods
friendships
and
druzhestva
minne
artels
in
russia
esnaifs
in
servia
and
turkey
amkari
in
georgia
and
so
on
took
such
a
formidable
development
in
medieval
times
and
played
such
an
important
part
in
the
emancipation
of
the
cities
but
it
took
historians
more
than
sixty
years
before
the
universality
of
this
institution
and
its
true
characters
were
understood
only
now
when
hundreds
of
guild
statutes
have
been
published
and
studied
and
their
relationship
to
the
roman
collegiae
and
the
earlier
unions
in
greece
and
in
india
is
known
can
we
maintain
with
full
confidence
that
these
brotherhoods
were
but
a
further
development
of
the
same
principles
which
we
saw
at
work
in
the
gens
and
the
village
community
nothing
illustrates
better
these
medieval
brother
hoods
than
those
temporary
guilds
which
were
formed
on
board
ships
when
a
ship
of
the
hansa
had
accomplished
her
first
passage
after
having
left
the
port
the
captain
schiffer
gathered
all
crew
and
passengers
on
the
deck
and
held
the
following
language
as
reported
by
a
contemporary
we
are
now
at
the
mercy
of
god
and
the
waves
he
said
one
must
be
equal
to
each
other
and
as
we
are
surrounded
by
storms
high
waves
pirates
and
other
dangers
we
must
keep
a
strict
order
that
we
may
bring
our
voyage
to
a
good
end
that
is
why
we
shall
pronounce
the
prayer
for
a
good
wind
and
good
success
and
according
to
marine
law
we
shall
name
the
occupiers
of
the
judges
seats
schoffenstellen
thereupon
the
crew
elected
a
vogt
and
four
scabini
to
act
as
their
judges
at
the
end
of
the
voyage
the
vogt
and
the
scabini
abdicated
their
functions
and
addressed
the
crew
as
follows
has
happened
on
board
ship
we
must
pardon
to
each
other
and
consider
as
dead
todt
und
ab
sein
lassen
what
we
have
judged
right
was
for
the
sake
of
justice
this
is
why
we
beg
you
all
in
the
name
of
honest
justice
to
forget
all
the
animosity
one
may
nourish
against
another
and
to
swear
on
bread
and
salt
that
he
will
not
think
of
it
in
a
bad
spirit
if
any
one
however
considers
himself
wronged
he
must
appeal
to
the
land
vogt
and
ask
justice
from
him
before
sunset
on
landing
the
stock
with
the
fredfines
was
handed
over
to
the
vogt
of
the
for
distribution
among
the
poor
this
simple
narrative
perhaps
better
than
anything
else
depicts
the
spirit
of
the
medieval
guilds
like
organizations
came
into
existence
wherever
a
group
of
men
fishermen
hunters
travelling
merchants
builders
or
settled
craftsmen
came
together
for
a
common
pursuit
thus
there
was
on
board
ship
the
naval
authority
of
the
captain
but
for
the
very
success
of
the
common
enterprise
all
men
on
board
rich
and
poor
masters
and
crew
captain
and
sailors
agreed
to
be
equals
in
their
mutual
relations
to
be
simply
men
bound
to
aid
each
other
and
to
settle
their
possible
disputes
before
judges
elected
by
all
of
them
so
also
when
a
number
of
craftsmen
masons
carpenters
came
together
for
building
say
a
cathedral
they
all
belonged
to
a
city
which
had
its
political
organization
and
each
of
them
belonged
moreover
to
his
own
craft
but
they
were
united
besides
by
their
common
enterprise
which
they
knew
better
than
any
one
else
and
they
joined
into
a
body
united
by
closer
although
temporary
bonds
they
founded
the
guild
for
the
building
of
the
cathedral
we
may
see
the
same
till
now
in
the
kabylian
cof
the
kabyles
have
their
village
community
but
this
union
is
not
sufficient
for
all
political
commercial
and
personal
needs
of
union
and
the
closer
brotherhood
of
the
cof
is
constituted
as
to
the
social
characters
of
the
medieval
guild
any
may
illustrate
them
taking
for
instance
the
skraa
of
some
early
danish
guild
we
read
in
it
first
a
statement
of
the
general
brotherly
feelings
which
must
reign
in
the
guild
next
come
the
regulations
relative
to
in
cases
of
quarrels
arising
between
two
brothers
or
a
brother
and
a
stranger
and
then
the
social
duties
of
the
brethren
are
enumerated
if
a
brother
house
is
burned
or
he
has
lost
his
ship
or
has
suffered
on
a
pilgrim
voyage
all
the
brethren
must
come
to
his
aid
if
a
brother
falls
dangerously
ill
two
brethren
must
keep
watch
by
his
bed
till
he
is
out
of
danger
and
if
he
dies
the
brethren
must
bury
him
a
great
affair
in
those
times
of
pestilences
and
follow
him
to
the
church
and
the
grave
after
his
death
they
must
provide
for
his
children
if
necessary
very
often
the
widow
becomes
a
sister
to
the
guild
these
two
leading
features
appeared
in
every
brotherhood
formed
for
any
possible
purpose
in
each
case
the
members
treated
each
other
as
and
named
each
other
brother
and
sister
all
were
equals
before
the
guild
they
owned
some
chattel
cattle
land
buildings
places
of
worship
or
stock
in
common
all
brothers
took
the
oath
of
abandoning
all
feuds
of
old
and
without
imposing
upon
each
other
the
obligation
of
never
quarrelling
again
they
agreed
that
no
quarrel
should
degenerate
into
a
feud
or
into
a
before
another
court
than
the
tribunal
of
the
brothers
themselves
and
if
a
brother
was
involved
in
a
quarrel
with
a
stranger
to
the
guild
they
agreed
to
support
him
for
bad
and
for
good
that
is
whether
he
was
unjustly
accused
of
aggression
or
really
was
the
aggressor
they
had
to
support
him
and
to
bring
things
to
a
peaceful
end
so
long
as
his
was
not
a
secret
aggression
in
which
case
he
would
have
been
treated
as
an
outlaw
the
brotherhood
stood
by
him
if
the
relatives
of
the
wronged
man
wanted
to
revenge
the
offence
at
once
by
a
new
aggression
the
supplied
him
with
a
horse
to
run
away
or
with
a
boat
a
pair
of
oars
a
knife
and
a
steel
for
striking
light
if
he
remained
in
town
twelve
brothers
accompanied
him
to
protect
him
and
in
the
meantime
they
arranged
the
composition
they
went
to
court
to
support
by
oath
the
truthfulness
of
his
statements
and
if
he
was
found
guilty
they
did
not
let
him
go
to
full
ruin
and
become
a
slave
through
not
paying
the
due
compensation
they
all
paid
it
just
as
the
gens
did
in
olden
times
only
when
a
brother
had
broken
the
faith
towards
his
or
other
people
he
was
excluded
from
the
brotherhood
with
a
nothing
name
tha
scal
han
maeles
af

met
nidings
nafn
such
were
the
leading
ideas
of
those
brotherhoods
which
gradually
covered
the
whole
of
medieval
life
in
fact
we
know
of
guilds
among
all
possible
professions
guilds
of
serfs
guilds
of
freemen
and
guilds
of
both
serfs
and
freemen
guilds
called
into
life
for
the
special
purpose
of
hunting
fishing
or
a
trading
expedition
and
dissolved
when
the
special
purpose
had
been
achieved
and
guilds
lasting
for
centuries
in
a
given
craft
or
trade
and
in
proportion
as
life
took
an
always
greater
variety
of
pursuits
the
variety
in
the
guilds
grew
in
proportion
so
we
see
not
only
merchants
craftsmen
hunters
and
peasants
united
in
guilds
we
also
see
guilds
of
priests
painters
teachers
of
primary
schools
and
universities
guilds
for
performing
the
passion
play
for
building
a
church
for
developing
the
mystery
of
a
given
school
of
art
or
craft
or
for
a
special
recreation
even
guilds
among
beggars
executioners
and
lost
women
all
organized
on
the
same
double
principle
of
and
mutual
support
for
russia
we
have
positive
evidence
showing
that
the
very
making
of
russia
was
as
much
the
work
of
its
hunters
fishermen
and
traders
artels
as
of
the
budding
village
communities
and
up
to
the
present
day
the
country
is
covered
with
artels
these
few
remarks
show
how
incorrect
was
the
view
taken
by
some
early
explorers
of
the
guilds
when
they
wanted
to
see
the
essence
of
the
institution
in
its
yearly
festival
in
reality
the
day
of
the
common
meal
was
always
the
day
or
the
morrow
of
the
day
of
election
of
aldermen
of
discussion
of
alterations
in
the
statutes
and
very
often
the
day
of
judgment
of
quarrels
that
had
risen
among
the
brethren
or
of
renewed
allegiance
to
the
guild
the
common
meal
like
the
festival
at
the
old
tribal
folkmote
the
mahl
or
malum
or
the
buryate
aba
or
the
parish
feast
and
the
harvest
supper
was
simply
an
affirmation
of
brotherhood
it
symbolized
the
times
when
everything
was
kept
in
common
by
the
clan
this
day
at
least
all
belonged
to
all
all
sate
at
the
same
table
and
partook
of
the
same
meal
even
at
a
much
later
time
the
inmate
of
the
almshouse
of
a
london
guild
sat
this
day
by
the
side
of
the
rich
alderman
as
to
the
distinction
which
several
explorers
have
tried
to
establish
between
the
old
saxon
frith
guild
and
the
social
or
religious
guilds
all
were
frith
guilds
in
the
sense
above
mentioned
and
all
were
religious
in
the
sense
in
which
a
village
community
or
a
city
placed
under
the
protection
of
a
special
saint
is
social
and
religious
if
the
institution
of
the
guild
has
taken
such
an
immense
extension
in
asia
africa
and
europe
if
it
has
lived
thousands
of
years
reappearing
again
and
again
when
similar
conditions
called
it
into
existence
it
is
because
it
was
much
more
than
an
eating
association
or
an
association
for
going
to
church
on
a
certain
day
or
a
burial
club
it
answered
to
a
deeply
inrooted
want
of
human
nature
and
it
embodied
all
the
attributes
which
the
state
appropriated
later
on
for
its
bureaucracy
and
police
and
much
more
than
that
it
was
an
association
for
mutual
support
in
all
circumstances
and
in
all
accidents
of
life
by
deed
and
advise
and
it
was
an
organization
for
maintaining
justice
with
this
difference
from
the
state
that
on
all
these
occasions
a
humane
a
brotherly
element
was
introduced
instead
of
the
formal
element
which
is
the
essential
characteristic
of
state
interference
even
when
appearing
before
the
guild
tribunal
the
answered
before
men
who
knew
him
well
and
had
stood
by
him
before
in
their
daily
work
at
the
common
meal
in
the
performance
of
their
brotherly
duties
men
who
were
his
equals
and
brethren
indeed
not
theorists
of
law
nor
defenders
of
some
one
interests
it
is
evident
that
an
institution
so
well
suited
to
serve
the
need
of
union
without
depriving
the
individual
of
his
initiative
could
but
spread
grow
and
fortify
the
difficulty
was
only
to
find
such
form
as
would
permit
to
federate
the
unions
of
the
guilds
without
interfering
with
the
unions
of
the
village
communities
and
to
federate
all
these
into
one
harmonious
whole
and
when
this
form
of
combination
had
been
found
and
a
series
of
favourable
circumstances
permitted
the
cities
to
affirm
their
independence
they
did
so
with
a
unity
of
thought
which
can
but
excite
our
admiration
even
in
our
century
of
railways
telegraphs
and
printing
hundreds
of
charters
in
which
the
cities
inscribed
their
liberation
have
reached
us
and
through
all
of
them
notwithstanding
the
infinite
variety
of
details
which
depended
upon
the
more
or
less
greater
fulness
of
emancipation
the
same
leading
ideas
run
the
city
organized
itself
as
a
federation
of
both
small
village
communities
and
guilds
all
those
who
belong
to
the
friendship
of
the
town
so
runs
a
charter
given
in
to
the
burghesses
of
aire
by
philip
count
of
flanders
have
promised
and
confirmed
by
faith
and
oath
that
they
will
aid
each
other
as
brethren
in
whatever
is
useful
and
honest
that
if
one
commits
against
another
an
offence
in
words
or
in
deeds
the
one
who
has
suffered
there
from
will
not
take
revenge
either
himself
or
his
people
he
will
lodge
a
complaint
and
the
offender
will
make
good
for
his
offence
according
to
what
will
be
pronounced
by
twelve
elected
judges
acting
as
arbiters
and
if
the
offender
or
the
offended
after
having
been
warned
thrice
does
not
submit
to
the
decision
of
the
arbiters
he
will
be
excluded
from
the
friendship
as
a
wicked
man
and
a
perjuror
each
one
of
the
men
of
the
commune
will
be
faithful
to
his
and
will
give
him
aid
and
advice
according
to
what
justice
will
dictate
him
the
amiens
and
abbeville
charters
say
all
will
aid
each
other
according
to
their
powers
within
the
boundaries
of
the
commune
and
will
not
suffer
that
any
one
takes
anything
from
any
one
of
them
or
makes
one
pay
contributions
do
we
read
in
the
charters
of
soissons
compiegne
senlis
and
many
others
of
the
same
type
and
so
on
with
countless
variations
on
the
same
theme
the
commune
guilbert
de
nogent
wrote
is
an
oath
of
mutual
aid
mutui
adjutorii
conjuratio
a
new
and
detestable
word
through
it
the
serfs
capite
sensi
are
freed
from
all
serfdom
through
it
they
can
only
be
condemned
to
a
legally
determined
fine
for
breaches
of
the
law
through
it
they
cease
to
be
liable
to
payments
which
the
serfs
always
used
to
pay
the
same
wave
of
emancipation
ran
in
the
twelfth
century
through
all
parts
of
the
continent
involving
both
rich
cities
and
the
poorest
towns
and
if
we
may
say
that
as
a
rule
the
italian
cities
were
the
first
to
free
themselves
we
can
assign
no
centre
from
which
the
movement
would
have
spread
very
often
a
small
burg
in
central
europe
took
the
lead
for
its
region
and
big
agglomerations
accepted
the
little
town
charter
as
a
model
for
their
own
thus
the
charter
of
a
small
town
lorris
was
adopted
by
towns
in
france
and
that
of
beaumont
became
the
model
for
over
five
hundred
towns
and
cities
in
belgium
and
france
special
deputies
were
dispatched
by
the
cities
to
their
neighbours
to
obtain
a
copy
from
their
charter
and
the
constitution
was
framed
upon
that
model
however
they
did
not
simply
copy
each
other
they
framed
their
own
charters
in
accordance
with
the
concessions
they
had
obtained
from
their
lords
and
the
result
was
that
as
remarked
by
an
historian
the
charters
of
the
medieval
communes
offer
the
same
variety
as
the
gothic
architecture
of
their
churches
and
cathedrals
the
same
leading
ideas
in
all
of
them
the
cathedral
symbolizing
the
union
of
parish
and
guild
in
the
city
and
the
same
infinitely
rich
variety
of
detail
was
the
essential
point
and
meant
but
the
commune
was
not
simply
an
autonomous
part
of
the
state
such
ambiguous
words
had
not
yet
been
invented
by
that
time
it
was
a
state
in
itself
it
had
the
right
of
war
and
peace
of
federation
and
alliance
with
its
neighbours
it
was
sovereign
in
its
own
affairs
and
mixed
with
no
others
the
supreme
political
power
could
be
vested
entirely
in
a
democratic
forum
as
was
the
case
in
pskov
whose
vyeche
sent
and
received
ambassadors
concluded
treaties
accepted
and
sent
away
princes
or
went
on
without
them
for
dozens
of
years
or
it
was
vested
in
or
usurped
by
an
aristocracy
of
merchants
or
even
nobles
as
was
the
case
in
hundreds
of
italian
and
middle
european
cities
the
principle
nevertheless
remained
the
same
the
city
was
a
state
and
what
was
perhaps
still
more
remarkable
when
the
power
in
the
city
was
usurped
by
an
aristocracy
of
merchants
or
even
nobles
the
inner
life
of
the
city
and
the
democratism
of
its
daily
life
did
not
disappear
they
depended
but
little
upon
what
may
be
called
the
political
form
of
the
state
the
secret
of
this
seeming
anomaly
lies
in
the
fact
that
a
medieval
city
was
not
a
centralized
state
during
the
first
centuries
of
its
existence
the
city
hardly
could
be
named
a
state
as
regards
its
interior
organization
because
the
middle
ages
knew
no
more
of
the
present
centralization
of
functions
than
of
the
present
territorial
centralization
each
group
had
its
share
of
sovereignty
the
city
was
usually
divided
into
four
quarters
or
into
five
to
seven
sections
radiating
from
a
centre
each
quarter
or
section
roughly
corresponding
to
a
certain
trade
or
profession
which
prevailed
in
it
but
nevertheless
containing
inhabitants
of
different
social
positions
and
occupations
nobles
merchants
artisans
or
even
and
each
section
or
quarter
constituted
a
quite
independent
agglomeration
in
venice
each
island
was
an
independent
political
community
it
had
its
own
organized
trades
its
own
commerce
in
salt
its
own
jurisdiction
and
administration
its
own
forum
and
the
nomination
of
a
doge
by
the
city
changed
nothing
in
the
inner
independence
of
the
units
in
cologne
we
see
the
inhabitants
divided
into
geburschaften
and
heimschaften
viciniae
neighbour
guilds
which
dated
from
the
franconian
period
each
of
them
had
its
judge
burrichter
and
the
usual
twelve
elected
schoffen
its
vogt
and
its
greve
or
commander
of
the
local
militia
the
story
of
early
london
before
the
conquest
green
says
is
that
of
a
number
of
little
groups
scattered
here
and
there
over
the
area
within
the
walls
each
growing
up
with
its
own
life
and
institutions
guilds
sokes
religious
houses
and
the
like
and
only
slowly
drawing
together
into
a
municipal
union
and
if
we
refer
to
the
annals
of
the
russian
cities
novgorod
and
pskov
both
of
which
are
relatively
rich
in
local
details
we
find
the
section
konets
consisting
of
independent
streets
ulitsa
each
of
which
though
chiefly
peopled
with
artisans
of
a
certain
craft
had
also
merchants
and
landowners
among
its
inhabitants
and
was
a
separate
community
it
had
the
communal
responsibility
of
all
members
in
case
of
crime
its
own
jurisdiction
and
administration
by
street
aldermen
ulichanskiye
starosty
its
own
seal
and
in
case
of
need
its
own
forum
its
own
militia
as
also
its
priests
and
its
own
collective
life
and
collective
enterprise
the
medieval
city
thus
appears
as
a
double
federation
of
all
householders
united
into
small
territorial
unions
the
street
the
parish
the
section
and
of
individuals
united
by
oath
into
guilds
according
to
their
professions
the
former
being
a
produce
of
the
origin
of
the
city
while
the
second
is
a
subsequent
growth
called
to
life
by
new
conditions
to
guarantee
liberty
and
peace
was
the
chief
aim
of
the
medieval
city
and
labour
as
we
shall
presently
see
when
speaking
of
the
craft
guilds
was
its
chief
foundation
but
production
did
not
absorb
the
whole
attention
of
the
medieval
economist
with
his
practical
mind
he
understood
that
consumption
must
be
guaranteed
in
order
to
obtain
production
and
therefore
to
provide
for
the
common
first
food
and
lodging
of
poor
and
rich
alike
gemeine
notdurft
und
gemach
armer
und
richer
was
the
fundamental
principle
in
each
city
the
purchase
of
food
supplies
and
other
first
necessaries
coal
wood
etc
before
they
had
reached
the
market
or
altogether
in
especially
favourable
conditions
from
which
others
would
be
excluded
the
preempcio
in
a
word
was
entirely
prohibited
everything
had
to
go
to
the
market
and
be
offered
there
for
every
one
purchase
till
the
ringing
of
the
bell
had
closed
the
market
then
only
could
the
retailer
buy
the
remainder
and
even
then
his
profit
should
be
an
honest
profit
only
moreover
when
corn
was
bought
by
a
baker
wholesale
after
the
close
of
the
market
every
citizen
had
the
right
to
claim
part
of
the
corn
about
for
his
own
use
at
wholesale
price
if
he
did
so
before
the
final
conclusion
of
the
bargain
and
reciprocally
every
baker
could
claim
the
same
if
the
citizen
purchased
corn
for
it
in
the
first
case
the
corn
had
only
to
be
brought
to
the
town
mill
to
be
ground
in
its
proper
turn
for
a
settled
price
and
the
bread
could
be
baked
in
the
four
banal
or
communal
oven
in
short
if
a
scarcity
visited
the
city
all
had
to
suffer
from
it
more
or
less
but
apart
from
the
calamities
so
long
as
the
free
cities
existed
no
one
could
die
in
their
midst
from
starvation
as
is
unhappily
too
often
the
case
in
our
own
times
however
all
such
regulations
belong
to
later
periods
of
the
life
while
at
an
earlier
period
it
was
the
city
itself
which
used
to
buy
all
food
supplies
for
the
use
of
the
citizens
the
documents
recently
published
by
mr
gross
are
quite
positive
on
this
point
and
fully
support
his
conclusion
to
the
effect
that
the
cargoes
of
subsistences
were
purchased
by
certain
civic
officials
in
the
name
of
the
town
and
then
distributed
in
shares
among

unless

to

this
seem
she
adds
to
have
been
quite
a
common
practice
in
england
ireland
wales
and
scotland
even
in
the
sixteenth
century
we
find
that
common
purchases
of
corn
were
made
for
the
comoditie
and
profitt
in
all
things
of
this
citie
and
chamber
of
london
and
of
all
the
citizens
and
inhabitants
of
the
same
as
moche
as
in
us
lieth
as
the
mayor
wrote
in
in
venice
the
whole
of
the
trade
in
corn
is
well
known
to
have
been
in
the
hands
of
the
city
the
quarters
on
receiving
the
cereals
from
the
board
which
administrated
the
imports
being
bound
to
send
to
every
citizen
house
the
quantity
allotted
to
him
in
france
the
city
of
amiens
used
to
purchase
salt
and
to
distribute
it
to
all
citizens
at
cost
price
and
even
now
one
sees
in
many
french
towns
the
halles
which
formerly
were
municipal
depots
for
corn
and
salt
in
russia
it
was
a
regular
custom
in
novgorod
and
pskov
the
whole
matter
relative
to
the
communal
purchases
for
the
use
of
the
citizens
and
the
manner
in
which
they
used
to
be
made
seems
not
to
have
yet
received
proper
attention
from
the
historians
of
the
period
but
there
are
here
and
there
some
very
interesting
facts
which
throw
a
new
light
upon
it
thus
there
is
among
mr
gross
documents
a
kilkenny
ordinance
of
the
year
from
which
we
learn
how
the
prices
of
the
goods
were
established
the
merchants
and
the
sailors
mr
gross
writes
were
to
state
on
oath
the
first
cost
of
the
goods
and
the
expenses
of
transportation
then
the
mayor
of
the
town
and
two
discreet
men
were
to
name
the
price
at
which
the
wares
were
to
be
sold
the
same
rule
held
good
in
thurso
for
merchandise
coming
by
sea
or
land
this
way
of
naming
the
price
so
well
answers
to
the
very
conceptions
of
trade
which
were
current
in
medieval
times
that
it
must
have
been
all
but
universal
to
have
the
price
established
by
a
third
person
was
a
very
old
custom
and
for
all
interchange
within
the
city
it
certainly
was
a
habit
to
leave
the
establishment
of
prices
to
discreet
men
to
a
third
party
and
not
to
the
vendor
or
the
buyer
but
this
order
of
things
takes
us
still
further
back
in
the
history
of
trade
namely
to
a
time
when
trade
in
staple
produce
was
carried
on
by
the
whole
city
and
the
merchants
were
only
the
commissioners
the
trustees
of
the
city
for
selling
the
goods
which
it
exported
a
waterford
ordinance
published
also
by
mr
gross
says
that
all
manere
of
marchandis
what
so
ever
kynde
thei
be
of
shal
be
bought
by
the
maire
and
balives
which
bene
commene
biers
common
buyers
for
the
town
for
the
time
being
and
to
distribute
the
same
on
freemen
of
the
citie
the
propre
goods
of
free
citisains
and
inhabitants
only
excepted
this
ordinance
can
hardly
be
explained
otherwise
than
by
admitting
that
all
the
exterior
trade
of
the
town
was
carried
on
by
its
agents
moreover
we
have
direct
evidence
of
such
having
been
the
case
for
novgorod
and
pskov
it
was
the
sovereign
novgorod
and
the
sovereign
pskov
who
sent
their
caravans
of
merchants
to
distant
lands
we
know
also
that
in
nearly
all
medieval
cities
of
middle
and
western
europe
the
craft
guilds
used
to
buy
as
a
body
all
necessary
raw
produce
and
to
sell
the
produce
of
their
work
through
their
officials
and
it
is
hardly
possible
that
the
same
should
not
have
been
done
for
exterior
trade
the
more
so
as
it
is
well
known
that
up
to
the
thirteenth
century
not
only
all
merchants
of
a
given
city
were
considered
abroad
as
responsible
in
a
body
for
debts
contracted
by
any
one
of
them
but
the
whole
city
as
well
was
responsible
for
the
debts
of
each
one
of
its
merchants
only
in
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
century
the
towns
on
the
rhine
entered
into
special
treaties
abolishing
this
responsibility
and
finally
we
have
the
remarkable
ipswich
document
published
by
mr
gross
from
which
document
we
learn
that
the
merchant
guild
of
this
town
was
constituted
by
all
who
had
the
freedom
of
the
city
and
who
wished
to
pay
their
contribution
their
hanse
to
the
guild
the
whole
community
discussing
all
together
how
better
to
maintain
the
merchant
guild
and
giving
it
certain
privileges
the
merchant
guild
of
ipswich
thus
appears
rather
as
a
body
of
trustees
of
the
town
than
as
a
common
private
guild
in
short
the
more
we
begin
to
know
the
mediaeval
city
the
more
we
see
that
it
was
not
simply
a
political
organization
for
the
protection
of
certain
political
liberties
it
was
an
attempt
at
organizing
on
a
much
grander
scale
than
in
a
village
community
a
close
union
for
mutual
aid
and
support
for
consumption
and
production
and
for
social
life
altogether
without
imposing
upon
men
the
fetters
of
the
state
but
giving
full
liberty
of
expression
to
the
creative
genius
of
each
separate
group
of
individuals
in
art
crafts
science
commerce
and
political
organization
how
far
this
attempt
has
been
successful
will
be
best
seen
when
we
have
analyzed
in
the
next
chapter
the
organization
of
labour
in
the
medieval
city
and
the
relations
of
the
cities

also
be
remarked
that
the

the
medieval
cities
were
not
organized
upon
some
preconceived
plan
in
obedience
to
the
will
of
an
outside
legislator
each
of
them
was
a
natural
growth
in
the
full
sense
of
the
word
an
always
varying
result
of
struggle
between
various
forces
which
adjusted
and
themselves
in
conformity
with
their
relative
energies
the
chances
of
their
conflicts
and
the
support
they
found
in
their
surroundings
therefore
there
are
not
two
cities
whose
inner
organization
and
destinies
would
have
been
identical
each
one
taken
separately
varies
from
century
to
century
and
yet
when
we
cast
a
broad
glance
upon
all
the
cities
of
europe
the
local
and
national
unlikenesses
disappear
and
we
are
struck
to
find
among
all
of
them
a
wonderful
resemblance
although
each
has
developed
for
itself
independently
from
the
others
and
in
different
conditions
a
small
town
in
the
north
of
scotland
with
its
population
of
coarse
labourers
and
fishermen
a
rich
city
of
flanders
with
its
commerce
luxury
love
of
amusement
and
animated
life
an
italian
city
enriched
by
its
intercourse
with
the
east
and
breeding
within
its
walls
a
refined
artistic
taste
and
civilization
and
a
poor
chiefly
agricultural
city
in
the
marsh
and
lake
district
of
russia
seem
to
have
little
in
common
and
nevertheless
the
leading
lines
of
their
organization
and
the
spirit
which
animates
them
are
imbued
with
a
strong
family
likeness
everywhere
we
see
the
same
federations
of
small
communities
and
guilds
the
same
round
the
mother
city
the
same
folkmote
and
the
same
insigns
of
its
independence
the
defensor
of
the
city
under
different
names
and
in
different
accoutrements
represents
the
same
authority
and
interests
food
supplies
labour
and
commerce
are
organized
on
closely
similar
lines
inner
and
outer
struggles
are
fought
with
like
ambitions
nay
the
very
formulae
used
in
the
struggles
as
also
in
the
annals
the
ordinances
and
the
rolls
are
identical
and
the
architectural
monuments
whether
gothic
roman
or
byzantine
in
style
express
the
same
aspirations
and
the
same
ideals
they
are
conceived
and
built
in
the
same
way
many
dissemblances
are
mere
differences
of
age
and
those
disparities
between
sister
cities
which
are
real
are
repeated
in
different
parts
of
europe
the
unity
of
the
leading
idea
and
the
identity
of
origin
make
up
for
differences
of
climate
geographical
situation
wealth
language
and
religion
this
is
why
we
can
speak
of
the
medieval
city
as
of
a
phase
of
civilization
and
while
every
research
insisting
upon
local
and
individual
differences
is
most
welcome
we
may
still
indicate
the
chief
lines
of
development
which
are
common
to
all
cities
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
protection
which
used
to
be
accorded
to
the
from
the
earliest
barbarian
times
has
played
an
important
though
not
an
exclusive
part
in
the
emancipation
of
the
medieval
city
the
early
barbarians
knew
no
trade
within
their
village
communities
they
traded
with
strangers
only
at
certain
definite
spots
on
certain
determined
days
and
in
order
that
the
stranger
might
come
to
the
without
risk
of
being
slain
for
some
feud
which
might
be
running
between
two
kins
the
market
was
always
placed
under
the
special
protection
of
all
kins
it
was
inviolable
like
the
place
of
worship
under
the
shadow
of
which
it
was
held
with
the
kabyles
it
is
still
annaya
like
the
footpath
along
which
women
carry
water
from
the
well
neither
must
be
trodden
upon
in
arms
even
during
wars
in
medieval
times
the
market
universally
enjoyed
the
same
protection
no
feud
could
be
prosecuted
on
the
place
whereto
people
came
to
trade
nor
within
a
certain
radius
from
it
and
if
a
quarrel
arose
in
the
motley
crowd
of
buyers
and
sellers
it
had
to
be
brought
before
those
under
whose
protection
the
market
stood
the
community
tribunal
or
the
bishop
the
lord
or
the
king
judge
a
stranger
who
came
to
trade
was
a
guest
and
he
went
on
under
this
very
name
even
the
lord
who
had
no
scruples
about
robbing
a
merchant
on
the
high
road
respected
the
weichbild
that
is
the
pole
which
stood
in
the
and
bore
either
the
king
arms
or
a
glove
or
the
image
of
the
local
saint
or
simply
a
cross
according
to
whether
the
market
was
under
the
protection
of
the
king
the
lord
the
local
church
or
the
folkmote
the
vyeche
it
is
easy
to
understand
how
the
of
the
city
could
develop
out
of
the
special
jurisdiction
in
the
when
this
last
right
was
conceded
willingly
or
not
to
the
city
itself
and
such
an
origin
of
the
city
liberties
which
can
be
traced
in
very
many
cases
necessarily
laid
a
special
stamp
upon
their
subsequent
development
it
gave
a
predominance
to
the
trading
part
of
the
community
the
burghers
who
possessed
a
house
in
the
city
at
the
time
being
and
were
in
the
constituted
very
often
a
merchant
guild
which
held
in
its
hands
the
city
trade
and
although
at
the
outset
every
burgher
rich
and
poor
could
make
part
of
the
merchant
guild
and
the
trade
itself
seems
to
have
been
carried
on
for
the
entire
city
by
its
trustees
the
guild
gradually
became
a
sort
of
privileged
body
it
jealously
prevented
the
outsiders
who
soon
began
to
flock
into
the
free
cities
from
entering
the
guild
and
kept
the
advantages
resulting
from
trade
for
the
few
families
which
had
been
burghers
at
the
time
of
the
emancipation
there
evidently
was
a
danger
of
a
merchant
oligarchy
being
thus
constituted
but
already
in
the
tenth
and
still
more
during
the
two
next
centuries
the
chief
crafts
also
organized
in
guilds
were
powerful
enough
to
check
the
oligarchic
tendencies
of
the
merchants
the
craft
guild
was
then
a
common
seller
of
its
produce
and
a
common
buyer
of
the
raw
materials
and
its
members
were
merchants
and
manual
workers
at
the
same
time
therefore
the
predominance
taken
by
the
old
craft
guilds
from
the
very
beginnings
of
the
free
city
life
guaranteed
to
manual
labour
the
high
position
which
it
afterwards
occupied
in
the
city
in
fact
in
a
medieval
city
manual
labour
was
no
token
of
inferiority
it
bore
on
the
contrary
traces
of
the
high
respect
it
had
been
kept
in
in
the
village
community
manual
labour
in
a
mystery
was
considered
as
a
pious
duty
towards
the
citizens
a
public
function
amt
as
honourable
as
any
other
an
idea
of
justice
to
the
community
of
right
towards
both
producer
and
consumer
which
would
seem
so
extravagant
now
penetrated
production
and
exchange
the
tanner
the
cooper
or
the
shoemaker
work
must
be
just
fair
they
wrote
in
those
times
wood
leather
or
thread
which
are
used
by
the
artisan
must
be
right
bread
must
be
baked
in
justice
and
so
on
transport
this
language
into
our
present
life
and
it
would
seem
affected
and
unnatural
but
it
was
natural
and
unaffected
then
because
the
medieval
artisan
did
not
produce
for
an
unknown
buyer
or
to
throw
his
goods
into
an
unknown
market
he
produced
for
his
guild
first
for
a
brotherhood
of
men
who
knew
each
other
knew
the
technics
of
the
craft
and
in
naming
the
price
of
each
product
could
appreciate
the
skill
displayed
in
its
fabrication
or
the
labour
bestowed
upon
it
then
the
guild
not
the
separate
producer
offered
the
goods
for
sale
in
the
community
and
this
last
in
its
turn
offered
to
the
brotherhood
of
allied
communities
those
goods
which
were
exported
and
assumed
responsibility
for
their
quality
with
such
an
organization
it
was
the
ambition
of
each
craft
not
to
offer
goods
of
inferior
quality
and
technical
defects
or
adulterations
became
a
matter
concerning
the
whole
community
because
an
ordinance
says
they
would
destroy
public
confidence
production
being
thus
a
social
duty
placed
under
the
control
of
the
whole
amitas
manual
labour
could
not
fall
into
the
degraded
condition
which
it
occupies
now
so
long
as
the
free
city
was
living
a
difference
between
master
and
apprentice
or
between
master
and
worker
compayne
geselle
existed
but
in
the
medieval
cities
from
their
very
beginnings
this
was
at
the
outset
a
mere
difference
of
age
and
skill
not
of
wealth
and
power
after
a
seven
years
apprenticeship
and
after
having
proved
his
knowledge
and
capacities
by
a
work
of
art
the
apprentice
became
a
master
himself
and
only
much
later
in
the
sixteenth
century
after
the
royal
power
had
destroyed
the
city
and
the
craft
organization
was
it
possible
to
become
master
in
virtue
of
simple
inheritance
or
wealth
but
this
was
also
the
time
of
a
general
decay
in
medieval
industries
and
art
there
was
not
much
room
for
hired
work
in
the
early
flourishing
periods
of
the
medieval
cities
still
less
for
individual
hirelings
the
work
of
the
weavers
the
archers
the
smiths
the
bakers
and
so
on
was
performed
for
the
craft
and
the
city
and
when
craftsmen
were
hired
in
the
building
trades
they
worked
as
temporary
corporations
as
they
still
do
in
the
russian
artels
whose
work
was
paid
en
bloc
work
for
a
master
began
to
multiply
only
later
on
but
even
in
this
case
the
worker
was
paid
better
than
he
is
paid
now
even
in
this
country
and
very
much
better
than
he
used
to
be
paid
all
over
europe
in
the
first
half
of
this
century
thorold
rogers
has
familiarized
english
readers
with
this
idea
but
the
same
is
true
for
the
continent
as
well
as
is
shown
by
the
researches
of
falke
and
schonberg
and
by
many
occasional
indications
even
in
the
fifteenth
century
a
mason
a
carpenter
or
a
smith
worker
would
be
paid
at
amiens
four
sols
a
day
which
corresponded
to
pounds
of
bread
or
to
the
eighth
part
of
a
small
ox
bouvard
in
saxony
the
salary
of
the
geselle
in
the
building
trade
was
such
that
to
put
it
in
falke
words
he
could
buy
with
his
six
days
wages
three
sheep
and
one
pair
of
shoes
the
donations
of
workers
geselle
to
cathedrals
also
bear
testimony
of
their
relative
to
say
nothing
of
the
glorious
donations
of
certain
craft
guilds
nor
of
what
they
used
to
spend
in
festivities
and
pageants
in
fact
the
more
we
learn
about
the
medieval
city
the
more
we
are
convinced
that
at
no
time
has
labour
enjoyed
such
conditions
of
prosperity
and
such
respect
as
when
city
life
stood
at
its
highest
more
than
that
not
only
many
aspirations
of
our
modern
radicals
were
already
realized
in
the
middle
ages
but
much
of
what
is
described
now
as
utopian
was
accepted
then
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
are
laughed
at
when
we
say
that
work
must
be
pleasant
but
every
one
must
be
pleased
with
his
work
a
medieval
kuttenberg
ordinance
says
and
no
one
shall
while
doing
nothing
mit
nichts
thun
appropriate
for
himself
what
others
have
produced
by
application
and
work
because
laws
must
be
a
shield
for
application
and
work
and
amidst
all
present
talk
about
an
eight
hours
day
it
may
be
well
to
remember
an
ordinance
of
ferdinand
the
first
relative
to
the
imperial
coal
mines
which
settled
the
miner
day
at
eight
hours
as
it
used
to
be
of
old
wie
vor
alters
herkommen
and
work
on
saturday
afternoon
was
prohibited
longer
hours
were
very
rare
we
are
told
by
janssen
while
shorter
hours
were
of
common
occurrence
in
this
country
in
the
fifteenth
century
rogers
says
the
workmen
worked
only
hours
a
week
the
saturday
too
which
we
consider
as
a
modern
conquest
was
in
reality
an
old
medieval
institution
it
was
for
a
great
part
of
the
community
while
wednesday
afternoon
was
for
the
geselle
and
although
school
meals
did
not
exist
probably
because
no
children
went
hungry
to
school
a
distribution
of
to
the
children
whose
parents
found
difficulty
in
providing
it
was
habitual
in
several
places
as
to
labour
congresses
they
also
were
a
regular
feature
of
the
middles
ages
in
some
parts
of
germany
craftsmen
of
the
same
trade
belonging
to
different
communes
used
to
come
together
every
year
to
discuss
questions
relative
to
their
trade
the
years
of
apprenticeship
the
wandering
years
the
wages
and
so
on
and
in
the
hanseatic
towns
formally
recognized
the
right
of
the
crafts
to
come
together
at
periodical
congresses
and
to
take
any
resolutions
so
long
as
they
were
not
contrary
to
the
cities
rolls
relative
to
the
quality
of
goods
such
labour
congresses
partly
international
like
the
hansa
itself
are
known
to
have
been
held
by
bakers
founders
smiths
tanners
and
the
craft
organization
required
of
course
a
close
supervision
of
the
craftsmen
by
the
guild
and
special
jurates
were
always
nominated
for
that
purpose
but
it
is
most
remarkable
that
so
long
as
the
cities
lived
their
free
life
no
complaints
were
heard
about
the
supervision
while
after
the
state
had
stepped
in
confiscating
the
property
of
the
guilds
and
destroying
their
independence
in
favour
of
its
own
bureaucracy
the
complaints
became
simply
countless
on
the
other
hand
the
immensity
of
progress
realized
in
all
arts
under
the
mediaeval
guild
system
is
the
best
proof
that
the
system
was
no
hindrance
to
individual
initiative
the
fact
is
that
the
medieval
guild
like
the
medieval
parish
street
or
quarter
was
not
a
body
of
citizens
placed
under
the
control
of
state
functionaries
it
was
a
union
of
all
men
connected
with
a
given
trade
jurate
buyers
of
raw
produce
sellers
of
manufactured
goods
and
artisans
masters
compaynes
and
apprentices
for
the
inner
organization
of
the
trade
its
assembly
was
sovereign
so
long
as
it
did
not
hamper
the
other
guilds
in
which
case
the
matter
was
brought
before
the
guild
of
the
guilds
the
city
but
there
was
in
it
something
more
than
that
it
had
its
own
its
own
military
force
its
own
general
assemblies
its
own
traditions
of
struggles
glory
and
independence
its
own
relations
with
other
guilds
of
the
same
trade
in
other
cities
it
had
in
a
word
a
full
organic
life
which
could
only
result
from
the
integrality
of
the
vital
functions
when
the
town
was
called
to
arms
the
guild
appeared
as
a
separate
company
schaar
armed
with
its
own
arms
or
its
own
guns
lovingly
decorated
by
the
guild
at
a
subsequent
epoch
under
its
own
commanders
it
was
in
a
word
as
independent
a
unit
of
the
federation
as
the
republic
of
uri
or
geneva
was
fifty
years
ago
in
the
swiss
confederation
so
that
to
compare
it
with
a
modern
trade
union
divested
of
all
attributes
of
state
sovereignty
and
reduced
to
a
couple
of
functions
of
secondary
importance
is
as
unreasonable
as
to
compare
florence
or
brugge
with
a
french
commune
vegetating
under
the
code
napoleon
or
with
a
russian
town
placed
under
catherine
the
second
municipal
law
both
have
elected
mayors
and
the
latter
has
also
its
craft
corporations
but
the
difference
is
all
the
difference
that
exists
between
florence
and
or
tsarevokokshaisk
or
between
a
venetian
doge
and
a
modern
mayor
who
lifts
his
hat
before
the
clerk
the
medieval
guilds
were
capable
of
maintaining
their
independence
and
later
on
especially
in
the
fourteenth
century
when
in
consequence
of
several
causes
which
shall
presently
be
indicated
the
old
municipal
life
underwent
a
deep
modification
the
younger
crafts
proved
strong
enough
to
conquer
their
due
share
in
the
management
of
the
city
affairs
the
masses
organized
in
minor
arts
rose
to
wrest
the
power
out
of
the
hands
of
a
growing
oligarchy
and
mostly
succeeded
in
this
task
opening
again
a
new
era
of
prosperity
true
that
in
some
cities
the
uprising
was
crushed
in
blood
and
mass
decapitations
of
workers
followed
as
was
the
case
in
paris
in
and
in
cologne
in
in
such
cases
the
city
liberties
rapidly
fell
into
decay
and
the
city
was
gradually
subdued
by
the
central
authority
but
the
majority
of
the
towns
had
preserved
enough
of
vitality
to
come
out
of
the
turmoil
with
a
new
life
and
vigour
a
new
period
of
rejuvenescence
was
their
reward
new
life
was
infused
and
it
found
its
expression
in
splendid
architectural
monuments
in
a
new
period
of
prosperity
in
a
sudden
progress
of
technics
and
invention
and
in
a
new
intellectual
movement
leading
to
the
renaissance
and
to
the
reformation
the
life
of
a
mediaeval
city
was
a
succession
of
hard
battles
to
conquer
liberty
and
to
maintain
it
true
that
a
strong
and
tenacious
race
of
burghers
had
developed
during
those
fierce
contests
true
that
love
and
worship
of
the
mother
city
had
been
bred
by
these
struggles
and
that
the
grand
things
achieved
by
the
mediaeval
communes
were
a
direct
outcome
of
that
love
but
the
sacrifices
which
the
communes
had
to
sustain
in
the
battle
for
freedom
were
nevertheless
cruel
and
left
deep
traces
of
division
on
their
inner
life
as
well
very
few
cities
had
succeeded
under
a
concurrence
of
favourable
circumstances
in
obtaining
liberty
at
one
stroke
and
these
few
mostly
lost
it
equally
easily
while
the
great
number
had
to
fight
fifty
or
a
hundred
years
in
succession
often
more
before
their
rights
to
free
life
had
been
recognized
and
another
hundred
years
to
found
their
liberty
on
a
firm
basis
the
twelfth
century
charters
thus
being
but
one
of
the
to
freedom
in
reality
the
mediaeval
city
was
a
fortified
oasis
amidst
a
country
plunged
into
feudal
submission
and
it
had
to
make
room
for
itself
by
the
force
of
its
arms
in
consequence
of
the
causes
briefly
alluded
to
in
the
preceding
chapter
each
village
community
had
gradually
fallen
under
the
yoke
of
some
lay
or
clerical
lord
his
house
had
grown
to
be
a
castle
and
his
were
now
the
scum
of
adventurers
always
ready
to
plunder
the
peasants
in
addition
to
three
days
a
week
which
the
peasants
had
to
work
for
the
lord
they
had
also
to
bear
all
sorts
of
exactions
for
the
right
to
sow
and
to
crop
to
be
gay
or
sad
to
live
to
marry
or
to
die
and
worst
of
all
they
were
continually
plundered
by
the
armed
robbers
of
some
neighbouring
lord
who
chose
to
consider
them
as
their
master
kin
and
to
take
upon
them
and
upon
their
cattle
and
crops
the
revenge
for
a
feud
he
was
fighting
against
their
owner
every
meadow
every
field
every
river
and
road
around
the
city
and
every
man
upon
the
land
was
under
some
lord
the
hatred
of
the
burghers
towards
the
feudal
barons
has
found
a
most
characteristic
expression
in
the
wording
of
the
different
charters
which
they
compelled
them
to
sign
heinrich
is
made
to
sign
in
the
charter
granted
to
speier
in
that
he
frees
the
burghers
from
the
horrible
and
execrable
law
of
mortmain
through
which
the
town
has
been
sunk
into
deepest
poverty

in
which
he
has
been

to
enumerate
all
the
mischiefs
due
to
his
mortmain

is
equally
characteristic
and
so
on
freedom
could
not
be
maintained
in
such
surroundings
and
the
cities
were
compelled
to
carry
on
the
war
outside
their
walls
the
burghers
sent
out
emissaries
to
lead
revolt
in
the
villages
they
received
villages
into
their
corporations
and
they
waged
direct
war
against
the
nobles
it
italy
where
the
land
was
thickly
sprinkled
with
feudal
castles
the
war
assumed
heroic
proportions
and
was
fought
with
a
stern
acrimony
on
both
sides
florence
sustained
for
years
a
succession
of
bloody
wars
in
order
to
free
its
contado
from
the
nobles
but
when
the
conquest
had
been
accomplished
in
all
had
to
begin
anew
the
nobles
rallied
they
constituted
their
own
leagues
in
opposition
to
the
leagues
of
the
towns
and
receiving
fresh
support
from
either
the
emperor
or
the
pope
they
made
the
war
last
for
another
years
the
same
took
place
in
rome
in
lombardy
all
over
italy
prodigies
of
valour
audacity
and
tenaciousness
were
displayed
by
the
citizens
in
these
wars
but
the
bows
and
the
hatchets
of
the
arts
and
crafts
had
not
always
the
upper
hand
in
their
encounters
with
the
knights
and
many
castles
withstood
the
ingenious
and
the
perseverance
of
the
citizens
some
cities
like
florence
bologna
and
many
towns
in
france
germany
and
bohemia
succeeded
in
emancipating
the
surrounding
villages
and
they
were
rewarded
for
their
efforts
by
an
extraordinary
prosperity
and
tranquillity
but
even
here
and
still
more
in
the
less
strong
or
less
impulsive
towns
the
merchants
and
artisans
exhausted
by
war
and
misunderstanding
their
own
interests
bargained
over
the
heads
they
compelled
the
lord
to
swear
allegiance
to
the
city
his
country
castle
was
dismantled
and
he
agreed
to
build
a
house
and
to
reside
in
the
city
of
which
he
became
a
but
he
maintained
in
return
most
of
his
rights
upon
the
peasants
who
only
won
a
partial
relief
from
their
burdens
the
burgher
could
not
understand
that
equal
rights
of
citizenship
might
be
granted
to
the
peasant
upon
whose
food
supplies
he
had
to
rely
and
a
deep
rent
was
traced
between
town
and
village
in
some
cases
the
peasants
simply
changed
owners
the
city
buying
out
the
barons
rights
and
selling
them
in
shares
to
her
own
citizens
serfdom
was
maintained
and
only
much
later
on
towards
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
it
was
the
craft
revolution
which
undertook
to
put
an
end
to
it
and
abolished
personal
servitude
but
dispossessed
at
the
same
time
the
serfs
of
the
land
it
hardly
need
be
added
that
the
fatal
results
of
such
policy
were
soon
felt
by
the
cities
themselves
the
country
became
the
city
enemy
the
war
against
the
castles
had
another
bad
effect
it
involved
the
cities
in
a
long
succession
of
mutual
wars
which
have
given
origin
to
the
theory
till
lately
in
vogue
namely
that
the
towns
lost
their
independence
through
their
own
jealousies
and
mutual
fights
the
imperialist
historians
have
especially
supported
this
theory
which
however
is
very
much
undermined
now
by
modern
research
it
is
certain
that
in
italy
cities
fought
each
other
with
a
stubborn
animosity
but
nowhere
else
did
such
contests
attain
the
same
proportions
and
in
italy
itself
the
city
wars
especially
those
of
the
earlier
period
had
their
special
causes
they
were
as
was
already
shown
by
sismondi
and
ferrari
a
mere
continuation
of
the
war
against
the
castles
the
free
municipal
and
federative
principle
unavoidably
entering
into
a
fierce
contest
with
feudalism
imperialism
and
papacy
many
towns
which
had
but
partially
shaken
off
the
yoke
of
the
bishop
the
lord
or
the
emperor
were
simply
driven
against
the
free
cities
by
the
nobles
the
emperor
and
church
whose
policy
was
to
divide
the
cities
and
to
arm
them
against
each
other
these
special
circumstances
partly
reflected
on
to
germany
also
explain
why
the
italian
towns
some
of
which
sought
support
with
the
emperor
to
combat
the
pope
while
the
others
sought
support
from
the
church
to
resist
the
emperor
were
soon
divided
into
a
gibelin
and
a
guelf
camp
and
why
the
same
division
appeared
in
each
separate
city
the
immense
economical
progress
realized
by
most
italian
cities
just
at
the
time
when
these
wars
were
hottest
and
the
alliances
so
easily
concluded
between
towns
still
better
characterize
those
struggles
and
further
undermine
the
above
theory
already
in
the
years
powerful
leagues
came
into
existence
and
a
few
years
later
when
frederick
barbarossa
invaded
italy
and
supported
by
the
nobles
and
some
retardatory
cities
marched
against
milan
popular
enthusiasm
was
roused
in
many
towns
by
popular
preachers
crema
piacenza
brescia
tortona
went
to
the
rescue
the
banners
of
the
guilds
of
verona
padua
vicenza
and
trevisa
floated
side
by
side
in
the
cities
camp
against
the
banners
of
the
emperor
and
the
nobles
next
year
the
lombardian
league
came
into
existence
and
sixty
years
later
we
see
it
reinforced
by
many
other
cities
and
forming
a
lasting
organization
which
had
half
of
its
federal
in
genoa
and
the
other
half
in
venice
in
tuscany
florence
headed
another
powerful
league
to
which
lucca
bologna
pistoia
belonged
and
which
played
an
important
part
in
crushing
down
the
nobles
in
middle
italy
while
smaller
leagues
were
of
common
occurrence
it
is
thus
certain
that
although
petty
jealousies
undoubtedly
existed
and
discord
could
be
easily
sown
they
did
not
prevent
the
towns
from
uniting
together
for
the
common
defence
of
liberty
only
later
on
when
separate
cities
became
little
states
wars
broke
out
between
them
as
always
must
be
the
case
when
states
struggle
for
supremacy
or
colonies
similar
leagues
were
formed
in
germany
for
the
same
purpose
when
under
the
successors
of
conrad
the
land
was
the
prey
of
interminable
feuds
between
the
nobles
the
westphalian
towns
concluded
a
league
against
the
knights
one
of
the
clauses
of
which
was
never
to
lend
money
to
a
knight
who
would
continue
to
conceal
stolen
goods
when
the
knights
and
the
nobles
lived
on
plunder
and
murdered
whom
they
chose
to
murder
as
the
wormser
zorn
complains
the
cities
on
the
rhine
mainz
cologne
speier
strasburg
and
basel
took
the
initiative
of
a
league
which
soon
numbered
sixty
allied
towns
repressed
the
robbers
and
maintained
peace
later
on
the
league
of
the
towns
of
suabia
divided
into
three
peace
districts
augsburg
constance
and
ulm
had
the
same
purpose
and
even
when
such
leagues
were
broken
they
lived
long
enough
to
show
that
while
the
supposed
peacemakers
the
kings
the
emperors
and
the
discord
and
were
themselves
helpless
against
the
robber
knights
it
was
from
the
cities
that
the
impulse
came
for
peace
and
union
the
cities
not
the
emperors
were
the
real
makers
of
the
national
unity
similar
federations
were
organized
for
the
same
purpose
among
small
villages
and
now
that
attention
has
been
drawn
to
this
subject
by
luchaire
we
may
expect
soon
to
learn
much
more
about
them
villages
joined
into
small
federations
in
the
contado
of
florence
so
also
in
the
dependencies
of
novgorod
and
pskov
as
to
france
there
is
positive
evidence
of
a
federation
of
seventeen
peasant
villages
which
has
existed
in
the
laonnais
for
nearly
a
hundred
years
till
and
has
fought
hard
for
its
independence
three
more
peasant
republics
which
had
sworn
charters
similar
to
those
of
laon
and
soissons
existed
in
the
neighbourhood
of
laon
and
their
territories
being
contiguous
they
supported
each
other
in
their
liberation
wars
altogether
luchaire
is
of
the
opinion
that
many
such
federations
must
have
come
into
existence
in
france
in
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
but
that
documents
relative
to
them
are
mostly
lost
of
course
being
unprotected
by
walls
they
could
easily
be
crushed
down
by
the
kings
and
the
lords
but
in
certain
favourable
circumstances
when
they
found
support
in
a
league
of
towns
and
protection
in
their
mountains
such
peasant
republics
became
independent
units
of
the
swiss
confederation
as
to
unions
between
cities
for
peaceful
purposes
they
were
of
quite
common
occurrence
the
intercourse
which
had
been
established
during
the
period
of
liberation
was
not
interrupted
afterwards
sometimes
when
the
scabini
of
a
german
town
having
to
pronounce
judgment
in
a
new
or
complicated
case
declared
that
they
knew
not
the
sentence
des
urtheiles
nicht
weise
zu
sein
they
sent
delegates
to
another
city
to
get
the
sentence
the
same
happened
also
in
france
while
forli
and
ravenna
are
known
to
have
mutually
naturalized
their
citizens
and
granted
them
full
rights
in
both
cities
to
submit
a
contest
arisen
between
two
towns
or
within
a
city
to
another
commune
which
was
invited
to
act
as
arbiter
was
also
in
the
spirit
of
the
times
as
to
commercial
treaties
between
cities
they
were
quite
habitual
unions
for
regulating
the
production
and
the
sizes
of
casks
which
were
used
for
the
commerce
in
wine
herring
unions
and
so
on
were
mere
precursors
of
the
great
commercial
federations
of
the
flemish
hansa
and
later
on
of
the
great
north
german
hansa
the
history
of
which
alone
might
contribute
pages
and
pages
to
illustrate
the
federation
spirit
which
permeated
men
at
that
time
it
hardly
need
be
added
that
through
the
hanseatic
unions
the
medieval
cities
have
contributed
more
to
the
development
of
international
intercourse
navigation
and
maritime
discovery
than
all
the
states
of
the
first
seventeen
centuries
of
our
era
in
a
word
federations
between
small
territorial
units
as
well
as
among
men
united
by
common
pursuits
within
their
respective
guilds
and
federations
between
cities
and
groups
of
cities
constituted
the
very
essence
of
life
and
thought
during
that
period
the
first
five
of
the
second
decade
of
centuries
of
our
era
may
thus
be
described
as
an
immense
attempt
at
securing
mutual
aid
and
support
on
a
grand
scale
by
means
of
the
principles
of
federation
and
association
carried
on
through
all
manifestations
of
human
life
and
to
all
possible
degrees
this
attempt
was
attended
with
success
to
a
very
great
extent
it
united
men
formerly
divided
it
secured
them
a
very
great
deal
of
freedom
and
it
tenfolded
their
forces
at
a
time
when
particularism
was
bred
by
so
many
agencies
and
the
causes
of
discord
and
jealousy
might
have
been
so
numerous
it
is
gratifying
to
see
that
cities
scattered
over
a
wide
continent
had
so
much
in
common
and
were
so
ready
to
confederate
for
the
prosecution
of
so
many
common
aims
they
succumbed
in
the
long
run
before
powerful
enemies
not
having
understood
the
principle
widely
enough
they
themselves
committed
fatal
faults
but
they
did
not
perish
through
their
own
jealousies
and
their
errors
were
not
a
want
of
federation
spirit
among
themselves
the
results
of
that
new
move
which
mankind
made
in
the
medieval
city
were
immense
at
the
beginning
of
the
eleventh
century
the
towns
of
europe
were
small
clusters
of
miserable
huts
adorned
but
with
low
clumsy
churches
the
builders
of
which
hardly
knew
how
to
make
an
arch
the
arts
mostly
consisting
of
some
weaving
and
forging
were
in
their
infancy
learning
was
found
in
but
a
few
monasteries
three
hundred
and
fifty
years
later
the
very
face
of
europe
had
been
changed
the
land
was
dotted
with
rich
cities
surrounded
by
immense
thick
walls
which
were
embellished
by
towers
and
gates
each
of
them
a
work
of
art
in
itself
the
cathedrals
conceived
in
a
grand
style
and
profusely
decorated
lifted
their
to
the
skies
displaying
a
purity
of
form
and
a
boldness
of
imagination
which
we
now
vainly
strive
to
attain
the
crafts
and
arts
had
risen
to
a
degree
of
perfection
which
we
can
hardly
boast
of
having
superseded
in
many
directions
if
the
inventive
skill
of
the
worker
and
the
superior
finish
of
his
work
be
appreciated
higher
than
rapidity
of
fabrication
the
navies
of
the
free
cities
furrowed
in
all
directions
the
northern
and
the
southern
mediterranean
one
effort
more
and
they
would
cross
the
oceans
over
large
tracts
of
land
had
taken
the
place
of
misery
learning
had
grown
and
spread
the
methods
of
science
had
been
elaborated
the
basis
of
natural
philosophy
had
been
laid
down
and
the
way
had
been
paved
for
all
the
mechanical
inventions
of
which
our
own
times
are
so
proud
such
were
the
magic
changes
accomplished
in
europe
in
less
than
four
hundred
years
and
the
losses
which
europe
sustained
through
the
loss
of
its
free
cities
can
only
be
understood
when
we
compare
the
seventeenth
century
with
the
fourteenth
or
the
thirteenth
the
prosperity
which
formerly
characterized
scotland
germany
the
plains
of
italy
was
gone
the
roads
had
fallen
into
an
abject
state
the
cities
were
depopulated
labour
was
brought
into
slavery
art
had
vanished
commerce
itself
was
decaying
if
the
medieval
cities
had
bequeathed
to
us
no
written
documents
to
testify
of
their
splendour
and
left
nothing
behind
but
the
monuments
of
building
art
which
we
see
now
all
over
europe
from
scotland
to
italy
and
from
gerona
in
spain
to
breslau
in
slavonian
territory
we
might
yet
conclude
that
the
times
of
independent
city
life
were
times
of
the
greatest
development
of
human
intellect
during
the
christian
era
down
to
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
on
looking
for
instance
at
a
medieval
picture
representing
nuremberg
with
its
scores
of
towers
and
lofty
spires
each
of
which
bore
the
stamp
of
free
creative
art
we
can
hardly
conceive
that
three
hundred
years
before
the
town
was
but
a
collection
of
miserable
hovels
and
our
admiration
grows
when
we
go
into
the
details
of
the
architecture
and
decorations
of
each
of
the
countless
churches
gates
and
communal
houses
which
are
scattered
all
over
europe
as
far
east
as
bohemia
and
the
now
dead
towns
of
polish
galicia
not
only
italy
that
mother
of
art
but
all
europe
is
full
of
such
monuments
the
very
fact
that
of
all
arts
architecture
a
social
art
above
all
had
attained
the
highest
development
is
significant
in
itself
to
be
what
it
was
it
must
have
originated
from
an
eminently
social
life
medieval
architecture
attained
its
grandeur
not
only
because
it
was
a
natural
development
of
handicraft
not
only
because
each
building
each
architectural
decoration
had
been
devised
by
men
who
knew
through
the
experience
of
their
own
hands
what
artistic
effects
can
be
obtained
from
stone
iron
bronze
or
even
from
simple
logs
and
mortar
not
only
because
each
monument
was
a
result
of
collective
experience
accumulated
in
each
mystery
or
craft
it
was
grand
because
it
was
born
out
of
a
grand
idea
like
greek
art
it
sprang
out
of
a
conception
of
brotherhood
and
unity
fostered
by
the
city
it
had
an
audacity
which
could
only
be
won
by
audacious
struggles
and
victories
it
had
that
expression
of
vigour
because
vigour
permeated
all
the
life
of
the
city
a
cathedral
or
a
communal
house
symbolized
the
grandeur
of
an
organism
of
which
every
mason
and
was
the
builder
and
a
medieval
building
appears
not
as
a
solitary
effort
to
which
thousands
of
slaves
would
have
contributed
the
share
assigned
them
by
one
man
imagination
all
the
city
contributed
to
it
the
lofty
rose
upon
a
structure
grand
in
itself
in
which
the
life
of
the
city
was
throbbing
not
upon
a
meaningless
scaffold
like
the
paris
iron
tower
not
as
a
sham
structure
in
stone
intended
to
conceal
the
ugliness
of
an
iron
frame
as
has
been
done
in
the
tower
bridge
like
the
acropolis
of
athens
the
cathedral
of
a
medieval
city
was
intended
to
glorify
the
grandeur
of
the
victorious
city
to
symbolize
the
union
of
its
crafts
to
express
the
glory
of
each
citizen
in
a
city
of
his
own
creation
after
having
achieved
its
craft
revolution
the
city
often
began
a
new
cathedral
in
order
to
express
the
new
wider
and
broader
union
which
had
been
called
into
life
the
means
at
hand
for
these
grand
undertakings
were
disproportionately
small
cologne
cathedral
was
begun
with
a
yearly
outlay
of
but
marks
a
gift
of
marks
was
inscribed
as
a
grand
donation
and
even
when
the
work
approached
completion
and
gifts
poured
in
in
proportion
the
yearly
outlay
in
money
stood
at
about
marks
and
never
exceeded
the
cathedral
of
basel
was
built
with
equally
small
means
but
each
corporation
contributed
its
part
of
stone
work
and
decorative
genius
to
their
common
monument
each
guild
expressed
in
it
its
political
conceptions
telling
in
stone
or
in
bronze
the
history
of
the
city
glorifying
the
principles
of
liberty
equality
and
fraternity
praising
the
city
allies
and
sending
to
eternal
fire
its
enemies
and
each
guild
bestowed
its
love
upon
the
communal
monument
by
richly
decorating
it
with
stained
windows
paintings
gates
worthy
to
be
the
gates
of
paradise
as
michel
angelo
said
or
stone
decorations
of
each
minutest
corner
of
the
building
small
cities
even
small
parishes
vied
with
the
big
agglomerations
in
this
work
and
the
cathedrals
of
laon
and
ouen
hardly
stand
behind
that
of
rheims
or
the
communal
house
of
bremen
or
the
folkmote
of
breslau
no
works
must
be
begun
by
the
commune
but
such
as
are
conceived
in
response
to
the
grand
heart
of
the
commune
composed
of
the
hearts
of
all
citizens
united
in
one
common
will
such
were
the
words
of
the
council
of
florence
and
this
spirit
appears
in
all
communal
works
of
common
utility
such
as
the
canals
terraces
vineyards
and
fruit
gardens
around
florence
or
the
irrigation
canals
which
intersected
the
plains
of
lombardy
or
the
port
and
aqueduct
of
genoa
or
in
fact
any
works
of
the
kind
which
were
achieved
by
almost
every
city
all
arts
had
progressed
in
the
same
way
in
the
medieval
cities
those
of
our
own
days
mostly
being
but
a
continuation
of
what
had
grown
at
that
time
the
prosperity
of
the
flemish
cities
was
based
upon
the
fine
woollen
cloth
they
fabricated
florence
at
the
beginning
of
the
fourteenth
century
before
the
black
death
fabricated
from
to
panni
of
woollen
stuffs
which
were
valued
at
golden
florins
the
chiselling
of
precious
metals
the
art
of
casting
the
fine
forging
of
iron
were
creations
of
the
mediaeval
mysteries
which
had
succeeded
in
attaining
in
their
own
domains
all
that
could
be
made
by
the
hand
without
the
use
of
a
powerful
prime
motor
by
the
hand
and
by
invention
because
to
use
whewell
words
parchment
and
paper
printing
and
engraving
improved
glass
and
steel
gunpowder
clocks
telescopes
the
mariner
compass
the
reformed
calendar
the
decimal
notation
algebra
trigonometry
chemistry
counterpoint
an
invention
equivalent
to
a
new
creation
of
music
these
are
all
possessions
which
we
inherit
from
that
which
has
so
disparagingly
been
termed
the
stationary
period
history
of
inductive
sciences
i
true
that
no
new
principle
was
illustrated
by
any
of
these
discoveries
as
whewell
said
but
medieval
science
had
done
something
more
than
the
actual
discovery
of
new
principles
it
had
prepared
the
discovery
of
all
the
new
principles
which
we
know
at
the
present
time
in
mechanical
sciences
it
had
accustomed
the
explorer
to
observe
facts
and
to
reason
from
them
it
was
inductive
science
even
though
it
had
not
yet
fully
grasped
the
importance
and
the
powers
of
induction
and
it
laid
the
foundations
of
both
mechanics
and
natural
philosophy
francis
bacon
galileo
and
copernicus
were
the
direct
descendants
of
a
roger
bacon
and
a
michael
scot
as
the
steam
engine
was
a
direct
product
of
the
researches
carried
on
in
the
italian
universities
on
the
weight
of
the
atmosphere
and
of
the
mathematical
and
technical
learning
which
characterized
nuremberg
but
why
should
one
take
trouble
to
insist
upon
the
advance
of
science
and
art
in
the
medieval
city
is
it
not
enough
to
point
to
the
cathedrals
in
the
domain
of
skill
and
to
the
italian
language
and
the
poem
of
dante
in
the
domain
of
thought
to
give
at
once
the
measure
of
what
the
medieval
city
created
during
the
four
centuries
it
lived
the
medieval
cities
have
undoubtedly
rendered
an
immense
service
to
european
civilization
they
have
prevented
it
from
being
drifted
into
the
theocracies
and
despotical
states
of
old
they
have
endowed
it
with
the
variety
the
the
force
of
initiative
and
the
immense
intellectual
and
material
energies
it
now
possesses
which
are
the
best
pledge
for
its
being
able
to
resist
any
new
invasion
of
the
east
but
why
did
these
centres
of
civilization
which
attempted
to
answer
to
needs
of
human
nature
and
were
so
full
of
life
not
live
further
on
why
were
they
seized
with
senile
debility
in
the
sixteenth
century
and
after
having
repulsed
so
many
assaults
from
without
and
only
borrowed
new
vigour
from
their
interior
struggles
why
did
they
finally
succumb
to
both
various
causes
contributed
to
this
effect
some
of
them
having
their
roots
in
the
remote
past
while
others
originated
in
the
mistakes
committed
by
the
cities
themselves
towards
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
mighty
states
reconstructed
on
the
old
roman
pattern
were
already
coming
into
existence
in
each
country
and
each
region
some
feudal
lord
more
cunning
more
given
to
hoarding
and
often
less
scrupulous
than
his
neighbours
had
succeeded
in
appropriating
to
himself
richer
personal
domains
more
peasants
on
his
lands
more
knights
in
his
following
more
treasures
in
his
chest
he
had
chosen
for
his
seat
a
group
of
villages
not
yet
trained
into
free
municipal
life
paris
madrid
or
moscow
and
with
the
labour
of
his
serfs
he
had
made
of
them
royal
fortified
cities
whereto
he
attracted
war
companions
by
a
free
distribution
of
villages
and
merchants
by
the
protection
he
offered
to
trade
the
germ
of
a
future
state
which
began
gradually
to
absorb
other
similar
centres
was
thus
laid
lawyers
versed
in
the
study
of
roman
law
flocked
into
such
centres
a
tenacious
and
ambitious
race
of
men
issued
from
among
the
burgesses
who
equally
hated
the
naughtiness
of
the
lords
and
what
they
called
the
lawlessness
of
the
peasants
the
very
forms
of
the
village
community
unknown
to
their
code
the
very
principles
of
federalism
were
repulsive
to
them
as
barbarian
inheritances
caesarism
supported
by
the
fiction
of
popular
consent
and
by
the
force
of
arms
was
their
ideal
and
they
worked
hard
for
those
who
promised
to
realize
it
the
christian
church
once
a
rebel
against
roman
law
and
now
its
ally
worked
in
the
same
direction
the
attempt
at
constituting
the
theocratic
empire
of
europe
having
proved
a
failure
the
more
intelligent
and
ambitious
bishops
now
yielded
support
to
those
whom
they
reckoned
upon
for
reconstituting
the
power
of
the
kings
of
israel
or
of
the
emperors
of
constantinople
the
church
bestowed
upon
the
rising
rulers
her
sanctity
she
crowned
them
as
god
representatives
on
earth
she
brought
to
their
service
the
learning
and
the
statesmanship
of
her
ministers
her
blessings
and
maledictions
her
riches
and
the
sympathies
she
had
retained
among
the
poor
the
peasants
whom
the
cities
had
failed
or
refused
to
free
on
seeing
the
burghers
impotent
to
put
an
end
to
the
interminable
wars
between
the
knights
which
wars
they
had
so
dearly
to
pay
for
now
set
their
hopes
upon
the
king
the
emperor
or
the
great
prince
and
while
aiding
them
to
crush
down
the
mighty
feudal
owners
they
aided
them
to
constitute
the
centralized
state
and
finally
the
invasions
of
the
mongols
and
the
turks
the
holy
war
against
the
maures
in
spain
as
well
as
the
terrible
wars
which
soon
broke
out
between
the
growing
centres
of
sovereignty
ile
de
france
and
burgundy
scotland
and
england
england
and
france
lithuania
and
poland
moscow
and
tver
and
so
on
contributed
to
the
same
end
mighty
states
made
their
appearance
and
the
cities
had
now
to
resist
not
only
loose
federations
of
lords
but
centres
which
had
armies
of
serfs
at
their
disposal
the
worst
was
that
the
growing
autocracies
found
support
in
the
divisions
which
had
grown
within
the
cities
themselves
the
fundamental
idea
of
the
medieval
city
was
grand
but
it
was
not
wide
enough
mutual
aid
and
support
can
not
be
limited
to
a
small
association
they
must
spread
to
its
surroundings
or
else
the
surroundings
will
absorb
the
association
and
in
this
respect
the
medieval
citizen
had
committed
a
formidable
mistake
at
the
outset
instead
of
looking
upon
the
peasants
and
artisans
who
gathered
under
the
protection
of
his
walls
as
upon
so
many
aids
who
would
contribute
their
part
to
the
making
of
the
city
as
they
really
did
a
sharp
division
was
traced
between
the
families
of
old
burghers
and
the
newcomers
for
the
former
all
benefits
from
communal
trade
and
communal
lands
were
reserved
and
nothing
was
left
for
the
latter
but
the
right
of
freely
using
the
skill
of
their
own
hands
the
city
thus
became
divided
into
the
burghers
or
the
commonalty
and
the
inhabitants
the
trade
which
was
formerly
communal
now
became
the
privilege
of
the
merchant
and
artisan
families
and
the
next
step
that
of
becoming
individual
or
the
privilege
of
oppressive
trusts
was
unavoidable
the
same
division
took
place
between
the
city
proper
and
the
surrounding
villages
the
commune
had
well
tried
to
free
the
peasants
but
her
wars
against
the
lords
became
as
already
mentioned
wars
for
freeing
the
city
itself
from
the
lords
rather
than
for
freeing
the
peasants
she
left
to
the
lord
his
rights
over
the
villeins
on
condition
that
he
would
molest
the
city
no
more
and
would
become
but
the
nobles
adopted
by
the
city
and
now
residing
within
its
walls
simply
carried
on
the
old
war
within
the
very
precincts
of
the
city
they
disliked
to
submit
to
a
tribunal
of
simple
artisans
and
merchants
and
fought
their
old
feuds
in
the
streets
each
city
had
now
its
colonnas
and
orsinis
its
overstolzes
and
wises
drawing
large
incomes
from
the
estates
they
had
still
retained
they
surrounded
themselves
with
numerous
clients
and
feudalized
the
customs
and
habits
of
the
city
itself
and
when
discontent
began
to
be
felt
in
the
artisan
classes
of
the
town
they
offered
their
sword
and
their
followers
to
settle
the
differences
by
a
free
fight
instead
of
letting
the
discontent
find
out
the
channels
which
it
did
not
fail
to
secure
itself
in
olden
times
the
greatest
and
the
most
fatal
error
of
most
cities
was
to
base
their
wealth
upon
commerce
and
industry
to
the
neglect
of
agriculture
they
thus
repeated
the
error
which
had
once
been
committed
by
the
cities
of
antique
greece
and
they
fell
through
it
into
the
same
crimes
the
estrangement
of
so
many
cities
from
the
land
necessarily
drew
them
into
a
policy
hostile
to
the
land
which
became
more
and
more
evident
in
the
times
of
edward
the
third
the
french
jacqueries
the
hussite
wars
and
the
peasant
war
in
germany
on
the
other
hand
a
commercial
policy
involved
them
in
distant
enterprises
colonies
were
founded
by
the
italians
in
the
by
german
cities
in
the
east
by
slavonian
cities
in
the
far
northeast
mercenary
armies
began
to
be
kept
for
colonial
wars
and
soon
for
local
defence
as
well
loans
were
contacted
to
such
an
extent
as
to
totally
demoralize
the
citizens
and
internal
contests
grew
worse
and
worse
at
each
election
during
which
the
colonial
politics
in
the
interest
of
a
few
families
was
at
stake
the
division
into
rich
and
poor
grew
deeper
and
in
the
sixteenth
century
in
each
city
the
royal
authority
found
ready
allies
and
support
among
the
poor
and
there
is
yet
another
cause
of
the
decay
of
communal
institutions
which
stands
higher
and
lies
deeper
than
all
the
above
the
history
of
the
medieval
cities
offers
one
of
the
most
striking
illustrations
of
the
power
of
ideas
and
principles
upon
the
destinies
of
mankind
and
of
the
quite
opposed
results
which
are
obtained
when
a
deep
modification
of
leading
ideas
has
taken
place
and
federalism
the
sovereignty
of
each
group
and
the
construction
of
the
political
body
from
the
simple
to
the
composite
were
the
leading
ideas
in
the
eleventh
century
but
since
that
time
the
conceptions
had
entirely
changed
the
students
of
roman
law
and
the
prelates
of
the
church
closely
bound
together
since
the
time
of
innocent
the
third
had
succeeded
in
paralyzing
the
idea
the
antique
greek
idea
which
presided
at
the
foundation
of
the
cities
for
two
or
three
hundred
years
they
taught
from
the
pulpit
the
university
chair
and
the
judges
bench
that
salvation
must
be
sought
for
in
a
state
placed
under
a
authority
that
one
man
can
and
must
be
the
saviour
of
society
and
that
in
the
name
of
public
salvation
he
can
commit
any
violence
burn
men
and
women
at
the
stake
make
them
perish
under
indescribable
tortures
plunge
whole
provinces
into
the
most
abject
misery
nor
did
they
fail
to
give
object
lessons
to
this
effect
on
a
grand
scale
and
with
an
cruelty
wherever
the
sword
and
the
church
fire
or
both
at
once
could
reach
by
these
teachings
and
examples
continually
repeated
and
enforced
upon
public
attention
the
very
minds
of
the
citizens
had
been
shaped
into
a
new
mould
they
began
to
find
no
authority
too
extensive
no
killing
by
degrees
too
cruel
once
it
was
for
public
safety
and
with
this
new
direction
of
mind
and
this
new
belief
in
one
man
power
the
old
federalist
principle
faded
away
and
the
very
creative
genius
of
the
masses
died
out
the
roman
idea
was
victorious
and
in
such
circumstances
the
centralized
state
had
in
the
cities
a
ready
prey
florence
in
the
fifteenth
century
is
typical
of
this
change
formerly
a
popular
revolution
was
the
signal
of
a
new
departure
now
when
the
people
brought
to
despair
insurged
it
had
constructive
ideas
no
more
no
fresh
idea
came
out
of
the
movement
a
thousand
representatives
were
put
into
the
communal
council
instead
of
men
entered
the
signoria
instead
of
but
a
revolution
of
figures
could
be
of
no
avail
the
people
discontent
was
growing
up
and
new
revolts
followed
a
saviour
the
tyran
was
appealed
to
he
massacred
the
rebels
but
the
disintegration
of
the
communal
body
continued
worse
than
ever
and
when
after
a
new
revolt
the
people
of
florence
appealed
to
their
most
popular
man
gieronimo
savonarola
for
advice
the
monk
answer
was
oh
people
mine
thou
knowest
that
i
can
not
go
into
state
affairs
purify
thy
soul
and
if
in
such
a
disposition
of
mind
thou
reformest
thy
city
then
people
of
florence
thou
shalt
have
inaugurated
the
reform
in
all
italy
carnival
masks
and
vicious
books
were
burned
a
law
of
charity
and
another
against
usurers
were
passed
and
the
democracy
of
florence
remained
where
it
was
the
old
spirit
had
gone
by
too
much
trusting
to
government
they
had
ceased
to
trust
to
themselves
they
were
unable
to
open
new
issues
the
state
had
only
to
step
in
and
to
crush
down
their
last
liberties
and
yet
the
current
of
mutual
aid
and
support
did
not
die
out
in
the
masses
it
continued
to
flow
even
after
that
defeat
it
rose
up
again
with
a
formidable
force
in
answer
to
the
communist
appeals
of
the
first
propagandists
of
the
reform
and
it
continued
to
exist
even
after
the
masses
having
failed
to
realize
the
life
which
they
hoped
to
inaugurate
under
the
inspiration
of
a
reformed
religion
fell
under
the
dominions
of
an
autocratic
power
it
flows
still
even
now
and
it
seeks
its
way
to
find
out
a
new
expression
which
would
not
be
the
state
nor
the
medieval
city
nor
the
village
community
of
the
barbarians
nor
the
savage
clan
but
would
proceed
from
all
of
them
and
yet
be
superior
to
them
in
its
wider
and
more
deeply
humane
conceptions

of

is

that
to
use

the

could
be
considered
as
an
emblem
of

we
find
it

if
the
considerations
indicated
in

according
to
which
trade
was
communal
at
its
beginnings
prove
to
be
correct
it
will
be
permissible
to
suggest
as
a
probable
hypothesis
that
the
guild
merchant
was
a
body
entrusted
with
commerce
in
the
interest
of
the
whole
city
and
only
gradually
became
a
guild
of
merchants
trading
for
themselves
while
the
merchant
adventurers
of
this
country
the
novgorod

free
colonizers
and
merchants
and
the
mercati

would
be
those
to
whom
it
was
left
to
open
new
markets
and
new
branches
of
commerce
for
themselves
altogether
it
must
be
remarked
that
the
origin
of
the
mediaeval
city
can
be
ascribed
to
no
separate
agency
it
was
a
result
of

the

in
man
has
so
remote
an
origin
and
is
so
deeply
interwoven
with
all
the
past
evolution
of
the
human
race
that
it
has
been
maintained
by
mankind
up
to
the
present
time
notwithstanding
all
vicissitudes
of
history
it
was
chiefly
evolved
during
periods
of
peace
and
prosperity
but
when
even
the
greatest
calamities
befell
men
when
whole
countries
were
laid
waste
by
wars
and
whole
populations
were
decimated
by
misery
or
groaned
under
the
yoke
of
tyranny
the
same
tendency
continued
to
live
in
the
villages
and
among
the
poorer
classes
in
the
towns
it
still
kept
them
together
and
in
the
long
run
it
reacted
even
upon
those
ruling
fighting
and
devastating
minorities
which
dismissed
it
as
sentimental
nonsense
and
whenever
mankind
had
to
work
out
a
new
social
organization
adapted
to
a
new
phasis
of
development
its
constructive
genius
always
drew
the
elements
and
the
inspiration
for
the
new
departure
from
that
same
tendency
new
economical
and
social
institutions
in
so
far
as
they
were
a
creation
of
the
masses
new
ethical
systems
and
new
religions
all
have
originated
from
the
same
source
and
the
ethical
progress
of
our
race
viewed
in
its
broad
lines
appears
as
a
gradual
extension
of
the
principles
from
the
tribe
to
always
larger
and
larger
agglomerations
so
as
to
finally
embrace
one
day
the
whole
of
mankind
without
respect
to
its
divers
creeds
languages
and
races
after
having
passed
through
the
savage
tribe
and
next
through
the
village
community
the
europeans
came
to
work
out
in
medieval
times
a
new
form
of
organization
which
had
the
advantage
of
allowing
great
latitude
for
individual
initiative
while
it
largely
responded
at
the
same
time
to
man
need
of
mutual
support
a
federation
of
village
communities
covered
by
a
network
of
guilds
and
fraternities
was
called
into
existence
in
the
medieval
cities
the
immense
results
achieved
under
this
new
form
of
union
in
for
all
in
industries
art
science
and
commerce
were
discussed
at
some
length
in
two
preceding
chapters
and
an
attempt
was
also
made
to
show
why
towards
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
the
medieval
republics
surrounded
by
domains
of
hostile
feudal
lords
unable
to
free
the
peasants
from
servitude
and
gradually
corrupted
by
ideas
of
roman
caesarism
were
doomed
to
become
a
prey
to
the
growing
military
states
however
before
submitting
for
three
centuries
to
come
to
the
authority
of
the
state
the
masses
of
the
people
made
a
formidable
attempt
at
reconstructing
society
on
the
old
basis
of
mutual
aid
and
support
it
is
well
known
by
this
time
that
the
great
movement
of
the
reform
was
not
a
mere
revolt
against
the
abuses
of
the
catholic
church
it
had
its
constructive
ideal
as
well
and
that
ideal
was
life
in
free
brotherly
communities
those
of
the
early
writings
and
sermons
of
the
period
which
found
most
response
with
the
masses
were
imbued
with
ideas
of
the
economical
and
social
brotherhood
of
mankind
the
twelve
articles
and
similar
professions
of
faith
which
were
circulated
among
the
german
and
swiss
peasants
and
artisans
maintained
not
only
every
one
right
to
interpret
the
bible
according
to
his
own
understanding
but
also
included
the
demand
of
communal
lands
being
restored
to
the
village
communities
and
feudal
servitudes
being
abolished
and
they
always
alluded
to
the
true
faith
a
faith
of
brotherhood
at
the
same
time
scores
of
thousands
of
men
and
women
joined
the
communist
fraternities
of
moravia
giving
them
all
their
fortune
and
living
in
numerous
and
prosperous
settlements
constructed
upon
the
principles
of
communism
only
wholesale
massacres
by
the
thousand
could
put
a
stop
to
this
popular
movement
and
it
was
by
the
sword
the
fire
and
the
rack
that
the
young
states
secured
their
first
and
decisive
victory
over
the
masses
of
the
people
for
the
next
three
centuries
the
states
both
on
the
continent
and
in
these
islands
systematically
weeded
out
all
institutions
in
which
the
tendency
had
formerly
found
its
expression
the
village
communities
were
bereft
of
their
folkmotes
their
courts
and
independent
administration
their
lands
were
confiscated
the
guilds
were
spoliated
of
their
possessions
and
liberties
and
placed
under
the
control
the
fancy
and
the
bribery
of
the
state
official
the
cities
were
divested
of
their
sovereignty
and
the
very
springs
of
their
inner
life
the
folkmote
the
elected
justices
and
administration
the
sovereign
parish
and
the
sovereign
guild
were
annihilated
the
state
functionary
took
possession
of
every
link
of
what
formerly
was
an
organic
whole
under
that
fatal
policy
and
the
wars
it
engendered
whole
regions
once
populous
and
wealthy
were
laid
bare
rich
cities
became
insignificant
boroughs
the
very
roads
which
connected
them
with
other
cities
became
impracticable
industry
art
and
knowledge
fell
into
decay
political
education
science
and
law
were
rendered
subservient
to
the
idea
of
state
centralization
it
was
taught
in
the
universities
and
from
the
pulpit
that
the
institutions
in
which
men
formerly
used
to
embody
their
needs
of
mutual
support
could
not
be
tolerated
in
a
properly
organized
state
that
the
state
alone
could
represent
the
bonds
of
union
between
its
subjects
that
federalism
and
particularism
were
the
enemies
of
progress
and
the
state
was
the
only
proper
initiator
of
further
development
by
the
end
of
the
last
century
the
kings
on
the
continent
the
parliament
in
these
isles
and
the
revolutionary
convention
in
france
although
they
were
at
war
with
each
other
agreed
in
asserting
that
no
separate
unions
between
citizens
must
exist
within
the
state
that
hard
labour
and
death
were
the
only
suitable
punishments
to
workers
who
dared
to
enter
into
coalitions
no
state
within
the
state
the
state
alone
and
the
state
church
must
take
care
of
matters
of
general
interest
while
the
subjects
must
represent
loose
aggregations
of
individuals
connected
by
no
particular
bonds
bound
to
appeal
to
the
government
each
time
that
they
feel
a
common
need
up
to
the
middle
of
this
century
this
was
the
theory
and
practice
in
europe
even
commercial
and
industrial
societies
were
looked
at
with
suspicion
as
to
the
workers
their
unions
were
treated
as
unlawful
almost
within
our
own
lifetime
in
this
country
and
within
the
last
twenty
years
on
the
continent
the
whole
system
of
our
state
education
was
such
that
up
to
the
present
time
even
in
this
country
a
notable
portion
of
society
would
treat
as
a
revolutionary
measure
the
concession
of
such
rights
as
every
one
freeman
or
serf
exercised
five
hundred
years
ago
in
the
village
folkmote
the
guild
the
parish
and
the
city
the
absorption
of
all
social
functions
by
the
state
necessarily
favoured
the
development
of
an
unbridled
individualism
in
proportion
as
the
obligations
towards
the
state
grew
in
numbers
the
citizens
were
evidently
relieved
from
their
obligations
towards
each
other
in
the
guild
and
in
medieval
times
every
man
belonged
to
some
guild
or
fraternity
two
brothers
were
bound
to
watch
in
turns
a
brother
who
had
fallen
ill
it
would
be
sufficient
now
to
give
neighbour
the
address
of
the
next
paupers
hospital
in
barbarian
society
to
assist
at
a
fight
between
two
men
arisen
from
a
quarrel
and
not
to
prevent
it
from
taking
a
fatal
issue
meant
to
be
oneself
treated
as
a
murderer
but
under
the
theory
of
the
state
the
bystander
need
not
intrude
it
is
the
policeman
business
to
interfere
or
not
and
while
in
a
savage
land
among
the
hottentots
it
would
be
scandalous
to
eat
without
having
loudly
called
out
thrice
whether
there
is
not
somebody
wanting
to
share
the
food
all
that
a
respectable
citizen
has
to
do
now
is
to
pay
the
poor
tax
and
to
let
the
starving
starve
the
result
is
that
the
theory
which
maintains
that
men
can
and
must
seek
their
own
happiness
in
a
disregard
of
other
wants
is
now
triumphant
all
round
in
law
in
science
in
religion
it
is
the
religion
of
the
day
and
to
doubt
of
its
efficacy
is
to
be
a
dangerous
utopian
science
loudly
proclaims
that
the
struggle
of
each
against
all
is
the
leading
principle
of
nature
and
of
human
societies
as
well
to
that
struggle
biology
ascribes
the
progressive
evolution
of
the
animal
world
history
takes
the
same
line
of
argument
and
political
economists
in
their
naive
ignorance
trace
all
progress
of
modern
industry
and
machinery
to
the
wonderful
effects
of
the
same
principle
the
very
religion
of
the
pulpit
is
a
religion
of
individualism
slightly
mitigated
by
more
or
less
charitable
relations
to
one
neighbours
chiefly
on
sundays
practical
men
and
theorists
men
of
science
and
religious
preachers
lawyers
and
politicians
all
agree
upon
one
thing
that
individualism
may
be
more
or
less
softened
in
its
harshest
effects
by
charity
but
that
it
is
the
only
secure
basis
for
the
maintenance
of
society
and
its
ulterior
progress
it
seems
therefore
hopeless
to
look
for
institutions
and
practices
in
modern
society
what
could
remain
of
them
and
yet
as
soon
as
we
try
to
ascertain
how
the
millions
of
human
beings
live
and
begin
to
study
their
everyday
relations
we
are
struck
with
the
immense
part
which
the
and
principles
play
even
in
human
life
although
the
destruction
of
institutions
has
been
going
on
in
practice
and
theory
for
full
three
or
four
hundred
years
hundreds
of
millions
of
men
continue
to
live
under
such
institutions
they
piously
maintain
them
and
endeavour
to
reconstitute
them
where
they
have
ceased
to
exist
in
our
mutual
relations
every
one
of
us
has
his
moments
of
revolt
against
the
fashionable
individualistic
creed
of
the
day
and
actions
in
which
men
are
guided
by
their
mutual
aid
inclinations
constitute
so
great
a
part
of
our
daily
intercourse
that
if
a
stop
to
such
actions
could
be
put
all
further
ethical
progress
would
be
stopped
at
once
human
society
itself
could
not
be
maintained
for
even
so
much
as
the
lifetime
of
one
single
generation
these
facts
mostly
neglected
by
sociologists
and
yet
of
the
first
importance
for
the
life
and
further
elevation
of
mankind
we
are
now
going
to
analyze
beginning
with
the
standing
institutions
of
mutual
support
and
passing
next
to
those
acts
of
mutual
aid
which
have
their
origin
in
personal
or
social
sympathies
when
we
cast
a
broad
glance
on
the
present
constitution
of
european
society
we
are
struck
at
once
with
the
fact
that
although
so
much
has
been
done
to
get
rid
of
the
village
community
this
form
of
union
continues
to
exist
to
the
extent
we
shall
presently
see
and
that
many
attempts
are
now
made
either
to
reconstitute
it
in
some
shape
or
another
or
to
find
some
substitute
for
it
the
current
theory
as
regards
the
village
community
is
that
in
western
europe
it
has
died
out
by
a
natural
death
because
the
communal
possession
of
the
soil
was
found
inconsistent
with
the
modern
requirements
of
agriculture
but
the
truth
is
that
nowhere
did
the
village
community
disappear
of
its
own
accord
everywhere
on
the
contrary
it
took
the
ruling
classes
several
centuries
of
persistent
but
not
always
successful
efforts
to
abolish
it
and
to
confiscate
the
communal
lands
in
france
the
village
communities
began
to
be
deprived
of
their
independence
and
their
lands
began
to
be
plundered
as
early
as
the
sixteenth
century
however
it
was
only
in
the
next
century
when
the
mass
of
the
peasants
was
brought
by
exactions
and
wars
to
the
state
of
subjection
and
misery
which
is
vividly
depicted
by
all
historians
that
the
plundering
of
their
lands
became
easy
and
attained
scandalous
proportions
every
one
has
taken
of
them
according
to
his
powers
imaginary
debts
have
been
claimed
in
order
to
seize
upon
their
lands
so
we
read
in
an
edict
promulgated
by
louis
the
fourteenth
in
of
course
the
state
remedy
for
such
evils
was
to
render
the
communes
still
more
subservient
to
the
state
and
to
plunder
them
itself
in
fact
two
years
later
all
money
revenue
of
the
communes
was
confiscated
by
the
king
as
to
the
appropriation
of
communal
lands
it
grew
worse
and
worse
and
in
the
next
century
the
nobles
and
the
clergy
had
already
taken
possession
of
immense
tracts
of
land
of
the
cultivated
area
according
to
certain
estimates
mostly
to
let
it
go
out
of
culture
but
the
peasants
still
maintained
their
communal
institutions
and
until
the
year
the
village
folkmotes
composed
of
all
householders
used
to
come
together
in
the
shadow
of
the
or
a
tree
to
allot
and
what
they
had
retained
of
their
fields
to
assess
the
taxes
and
to
elect
their
executive
just
as
the
russian
mir
does
at
the
present
time
this
is
what
babeau
researches
have
proved
to
demonstration
the
government
found
however
the
folkmotes
too
noisy
too
disobedient
and
in
elected
councils
composed
of
a
mayor
and
three
to
six
syndics
chosen
from
among
the
wealthier
peasants
were
introduced
instead
two
years
later
the
revolutionary
assemblee
constituante
which
was
on
this
point
at
one
with
the
old
regime
fully
confirmed
this
law
on
the
of
december
and
the
bourgeois
du
village
had
now
their
turn
for
the
plunder
of
communal
lands
which
continued
all
through
the
revolutionary
period
only
on
the
of
august
the
convention
under
the
pressure
of
the
insurrections
decided
to
return
the
enclosed
lands
to
the
communes
but
it
ordered
at
the
same
time
that
they
should
be
divided
in
equal
parts
among
the
wealthier
peasants
only
a
measure
which
provoked
new
insurrections
and
was
abrogated
next
year
in
when
the
order
came
to
divide
the
communal
lands
among
all
commoners
rich
and
poor
alike
active
and
inactive
these
two
laws
however
ran
so
much
against
the
conceptions
of
the
peasants
that
they
were
not
obeyed
and
wherever
the
peasants
had
retaken
possession
of
part
of
their
lands
they
kept
them
undivided
but
then
came
the
long
years
of
wars
and
the
communal
lands
were
simply
confiscated
by
the
state
in
as
a
mortgage
for
state
loans
put
up
for
sale
and
plundered
as
such
then
returned
again
to
the
communes
and
confiscated
again
in
and
only
in
what
remained
of
them
about
acres
of
the
least
productive
land
was
restored
to
the
village
communities
still
this
was
not
yet
the
end
of
the
troubles
of
the
communes
every
new
regime
saw
in
the
communal
lands
a
means
for
gratifying
its
supporters
and
three
laws
the
first
in
and
the
last
under
napoleon
the
third
were
passed
to
induce
the
village
communities
to
divide
their
estates
three
times
these
laws
had
to
be
repealed
in
consequence
of
the
opposition
they
met
with
in
the
villages
but
something
was
snapped
up
each
time
and
napoleon
the
third
under
the
pretext
of
encouraging
perfected
methods
of
agriculture
granted
large
estates
out
of
the
communal
lands
to
some
of
his
favourites
as
to
the
autonomy
of
the
village
communities
what
could
be
retained
of
it
after
so
many
blows
the
mayor
and
the
syndics
were
simply
looked
upon
as
unpaid
functionaries
of
the
state
machinery
even
now
under
the
third
republic
very
little
can
be
done
in
a
village
community
without
the
huge
state
machinery
up
to
the
prefet
and
the
ministries
being
set
in
motion
it
is
hardly
credible
and
yet
it
is
true
that
when
for
instance
a
peasant
intends
to
pay
in
money
his
share
in
the
repair
of
a
communal
road
instead
of
himself
breaking
the
necessary
amount
of
stones
no
fewer
than
twelve
different
functionaries
of
the
state
must
give
their
approval
and
an
aggregate
of
different
acts
must
be
performed
by
them
and
exchanged
between
them
before
the
peasant
is
permitted
to
pay
that
money
to
the
communal
council
all
the
remainder
bears
the
same
character
what
took
place
in
france
took
place
everywhere
in
western
and
middle
europe
even
the
chief
dates
of
the
great
assaults
upon
the
peasant
lands
are
the
same
for
england
the
only
difference
is
that
the
spoliation
was
accomplished
by
separate
acts
rather
than
by
general
sweeping
measures
with
less
haste
but
more
thoroughly
than
in
france
the
seizure
of
the
communal
lands
by
the
lords
also
began
in
the
fifteenth
century
after
the
defeat
of
the
peasant
insurrection
of
as
seen
from
rossus
historia
and
from
a
statute
of
henry
the
seventh
in
which
these
seizures
are
spoken
of
under
the
heading
of
enormitees
and
myschefes
as
be
hurtfull
to
the
common
wele
later
on
the
great
inquest
under
henry
the
eighth
was
begun
as
is
known
in
order
to
put
a
stop
to
the
enclosure
of
communal
lands
but
it
ended
in
a
sanction
of
what
had
been
done
the
communal
lands
continued
to
be
preyed
upon
and
the
peasants
were
driven
from
the
land
but
it
was
especially
since
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
that
in
england
as
everywhere
else
it
became
part
of
a
systematic
policy
to
simply
weed
out
all
traces
of
communal
ownership
and
the
wonder
is
not
that
it
has
disappeared
but
that
it
could
be
maintained
even
in
england
so
as
to
be
generally
prevalent
so
late
as
the
grandfathers
of
this
generation
the
very
object
of
the
enclosure
acts
as
shown
by
seebohm
was
to
remove
this
system
and
it
was
so
well
removed
by
the
nearly
four
thousand
acts
passed
between
and
that
only
faint
traces
of
it
remain
now
the
land
of
the
village
communities
was
taken
by
the
lords
and
the
appropriation
was
sanctioned
by
parliament
in
each
separate
case
in
germany
in
austria
in
belgium
the
village
community
was
also
destroyed
by
the
state
instances
of
commoners
themselves
dividing
their
lands
were
rare
while
everywhere
the
states
coerced
them
to
enforce
the
division
or
simply
favoured
the
private
appropriation
of
their
lands
the
last
blow
to
communal
ownership
in
middle
europe
also
dates
from
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
in
austria
sheer
force
was
used
by
the
government
in
to
compel
the
communes
to
divide
their
lands
a
special
commission
being
nominated
two
years
later
for
that
purpose
in
prussia
frederick
the
second
in
several
of
his
ordinances
in
and
recommended
to
the
justizcollegien
to
enforce
the
division
in
silesia
a
special
resolution
was
issued
to
serve
that
aim
in
the
same
took
place
in
belgium
and
as
the
communes
did
not
obey
a
law
was
issued
in
empowering
the
government
to
buy
communal
meadows
in
order
to
sell
them
in
retail
and
to
make
a
forced
sale
of
the
communal
land
when
there
was
a
buyer
for
it
in
short
to
speak
of
the
natural
death
of
the
village
communities
in
virtue
of
economical
laws
is
as
grim
a
joke
as
to
speak
of
the
natural
death
of
soldiers
slaughtered
on
a
battlefield
the
fact
was
simply
this
the
village
communities
had
lived
for
over
a
thousand
years
and
where
and
when
the
peasants
were
not
ruined
by
wars
and
exactions
they
steadily
improved
their
methods
of
culture
but
as
the
value
of
land
was
increasing
in
consequence
of
the
growth
of
industries
and
the
nobility
had
acquired
under
the
state
organization
a
power
which
it
never
had
had
under
the
feudal
system
it
took
possession
of
the
best
parts
of
the
communal
lands
and
did
its
best
to
destroy
the
communal
institutions
however
the
institutions
so
well
respond
to
the
needs
and
conceptions
of
the
tillers
of
the
soil
that
in
spite
of
all
europe
is
up
to
this
date
covered
with
living
survivals
of
the
village
communities
and
european
country
life
is
permeated
with
customs
and
habits
dating
from
the
community
period
even
in
england
notwithstanding
all
the
drastic
measures
taken
against
the
old
order
of
things
it
prevailed
as
late
as
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
gomme
one
of
the
very
few
english
scholars
who
have
paid
attention
to
the
subject
shows
in
his
work
that
many
traces
of
the
communal
possession
of
the
soil
are
found
in
scotland
runrig
tenancy
having
been
maintained
in
forfarshire
up
to
while
in
certain
villages
of
inverness
the
custom
was
up
to
to
plough
the
land
for
the
whole
community
without
leaving
any
boundaries
and
to
allot
it
after
the
ploughing
was
done
in
kilmorie
the
allotment
and
of
the
fields
was
in
full
vigour
till
the
last
years
and
the
crofters
commission
found
it
still
in
vigour
in
certain
islands
in
ireland
the
system
prevailed
up
to
the
great
famine
and
as
to
england
marshall
works
which
passed
unnoticed
until
nasse
and
sir
henry
maine
drew
attention
to
them
leave
no
doubt
as
to
the
system
having
been
widely
spread
in
nearly
all
english
counties
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
no
more
than
twenty
years
ago
sir
henry
maine
was
greatly
surprised
at
the
number
of
instances
of
abnormal
property
rights
necessarily
implying
the
former
existence
of
collective
ownership
and
joint
cultivation
which
a
comparatively
brief
inquiry
brought
under
his
notice
and
communal
institutions
having
persisted
so
late
as
that
a
great
number
of
habits
and
customs
would
undoubtedly
be
discovered
in
english
villages
if
the
writers
of
this
country
only
paid
attention
to
village
life
as
to
the
continent
we
find
the
communal
institutions
fully
alive
in
many
parts
of
france
switzerland
germany
italy
the
scandinavian
lands
and
spain
to
say
nothing
of
eastern
europe
the
village
life
in
these
countries
is
permeated
with
communal
habits
and
customs
and
almost
every
year
the
continental
literature
is
enriched
by
serious
works
dealing
with
this
and
connected
subjects
i
must
therefore
limit
my
illustrations
to
the
most
typical
instances
switzerland
is
undoubtedly
one
of
them
not
only
the
five
republics
of
uri
schwytz
appenzell
glarus
and
unterwalden
hold
their
lands
as
undivided
estates
and
are
governed
by
their
popular
folkmotes
but
in
all
other
cantons
too
the
village
communities
remain
in
possession
of
a
wide
and
own
large
parts
of
the
federal
territory
of
all
the
alpine
meadows
and
of
all
the
forests
of
switzerland
are
until
now
communal
land
and
a
considerable
number
of
fields
orchards
vineyards
peat
bogs
quarries
and
so
on
are
owned
in
common
in
the
vaud
where
all
the
householders
continue
to
take
part
in
the
deliberations
of
their
elected
communal
councils
the
communal
spirit
is
especially
alive
towards
the
end
of
the
winter
all
the
young
men
of
each
village
go
to
stay
a
few
days
in
the
woods
to
fell
timber
and
to
bring
it
down
the
steep
slopes
tobogganing
way
the
timber
and
the
fuel
wood
being
divided
among
all
households
or
sold
for
their
benefit
these
excursions
are
real
fetes
of
manly
labour
on
the
banks
of
lake
leman
part
of
the
work
required
to
keep
up
the
terraces
of
the
vineyards
is
still
done
in
common
and
in
the
spring
when
the
thermometer
threatens
to
fall
below
zero
before
sunrise
the
watchman
wakes
up
all
householders
who
light
fires
of
straw
and
dung
and
protect
their
from
the
frost
by
an
artificial
cloud
in
nearly
all
cantons
the
village
communities
possess
burgernutzen
that
is
they
hold
in
common
a
number
of
cows
in
order
to
supply
each
family
with
butter
or
they
keep
communal
fields
or
vineyards
of
which
the
produce
is
divided
between
the
burghers
or
they
rent
their
land
for
the
benefit
of
the
community
it
may
be
taken
as
a
rule
that
where
the
communes
have
retained
a
wide
sphere
of
functions
so
as
to
be
living
parts
of
the
national
organism
and
where
they
have
not
been
reduced
to
sheer
misery
they
never
fail
to
take
good
care
of
their
lands
accordingly
the
communal
estates
in
switzerland
strikingly
contrast
with
the
miserable
state
of
commons
in
this
country
the
communal
forests
in
the
vaud
and
the
valais
are
admirably
managed
in
conformity
with
the
rules
of
modern
forestry
elsewhere
the
strips
of
communal
fields
which
change
owners
under
the
system
of
are
very
well
manured
especially
as
there
is
no
lack
of
meadows
and
cattle
the
high
level
meadows
are
well
kept
as
a
rule
and
the
rural
roads
are
excellent
and
when
we
admire
the
swiss
chalet
the
mountain
road
the
peasants
cattle
the
terraces
of
vineyards
or
the
in
switzer
land
we
must
keep
in
mind
that
without
the
timber
for
the
chalet
being
taken
from
the
communal
woods
and
the
stone
from
the
communal
quarries
without
the
cows
being
kept
on
the
communal
meadows
and
the
roads
being
made
and
the
built
by
communal
work
there
would
be
little
to
admire
it
hardly
need
be
said
that
a
great
number
of
habits
and
customs
continue
to
persist
in
the
swiss
villages
the
evening
gatherings
for
shelling
walnuts
which
take
place
in
turns
in
each
household
the
evening
parties
for
sewing
the
dowry
of
the
girl
who
is
going
to
marry
the
calling
of
aids
for
building
the
houses
and
taking
in
the
crops
as
well
as
for
all
sorts
of
work
which
may
be
required
by
one
of
the
commoners
the
custom
of
exchanging
children
from
one
canton
to
the
other
in
order
to
make
them
learn
two
languages
french
and
german
and
so
on
all
these
are
quite
habitual
while
on
the
other
side
divers
modern
requirements
are
met
in
the
same
spirit
thus
in
glarus
most
of
the
alpine
meadows
have
been
sold
during
a
time
of
calamity
but
the
communes
still
continue
to
buy
field
land
and
after
the
fields
have
been
left
in
the
possession
of
separate
commoners
for
ten
twenty
or
thirty
years
as
the
case
might
be
they
return
to
the
common
stock
which
is
according
to
the
needs
of
all
a
great
number
of
small
associations
are
formed
to
produce
some
of
the
necessaries
for
life
bread
cheese
and
wine
by
common
work
be
it
only
on
a
limited
scale
and
agricultural
altogether
spreads
in
switzerland
with
the
greatest
ease
associations
formed
between
ten
to
thirty
peasants
who
buy
meadows
and
fields
in
common
and
cultivate
them
as
are
of
common
occurrence
while
dairy
associations
for
the
sale
of
milk
butter
and
cheese
are
organized
everywhere
in
fact
switzerland
was
the
birthplace
of
that
form
of
it
offers
moreover
an
immense
field
for
the
study
of
all
sorts
of
small
and
large
societies
formed
for
the
satisfaction
of
all
sorts
of
modern
wants
in
certain
parts
of
switzerland
one
finds
in
almost
every
village
a
number
of
associations
for
protection
from
fire
for
boating
for
maintaining
the
quays
on
the
shores
of
a
lake
for
the
supply
of
water
and
so
on
and
the
country
is
covered
with
societies
of
archers
sharpshooters
topographers
footpath
explorers
and
the
like
originated
from
modern
militarism
switzerland
is
however
by
no
means
an
exception
in
europe
because
the
same
institutions
and
habits
are
found
in
the
villages
of
france
of
italy
of
germany
of
denmark
and
so
on
we
have
just
seen
what
has
been
done
by
the
rulers
of
france
in
order
to
destroy
the
village
community
and
to
get
hold
of
its
lands
but
notwithstanding
all
that
part
of
the
whole
territory
available
for
culture
acres
including
of
all
the
natural
meadows
and
nearly
a
fifth
part
of
all
the
forests
of
the
country
remain
in
communal
possession
the
woods
supply
the
communers
with
fuel
and
the
timber
wood
is
cut
mostly
by
communal
work
with
all
desirable
regularity
the
grazing
lands
are
free
for
the
commoners
cattle
and
what
remains
of
communal
fields
is
allotted
and
in
certain
parts
ardennes
in
the
usual
of
france
namely
in
the
way
these
additional
sources
of
supply
which
aid
the
poorer
peasants
to
pass
through
a
year
of
bad
crops
without
parting
with
their
small
plots
of
land
and
without
running
into
irredeemable
debts
have
certainly
their
importance
for
both
the
agricultural
labourers
and
the
nearly
three
millions
of
small
peasant
proprietors
it
is
even
doubtful
whether
small
peasant
proprietorship
could
be
maintained
without
these
additional
resources
but
the
ethical
importance
of
the
communal
possessions
small
as
they
are
is
still
greater
than
their
economical
value
they
maintain
in
village
life
a
nucleus
of
customs
and
habits
of
mutual
aid
which
undoubtedly
acts
as
a
mighty
check
upon
the
development
of
reckless
individualism
and
greediness
which
small
is
only
too
prone
to
develop
mutual
aid
in
all
possible
circumstances
of
village
life
is
part
of
the
routine
life
in
all
parts
of
the
country
everywhere
we
meet
under
different
names
with
the
charroi
the
free
aid
of
the
neighbours
for
taking
in
a
crop
for
vintage
or
for
building
a
house
everywhere
we
find
the
same
evening
gatherings
as
have
just
been
mentioned
in
switzerland
and
everywhere
the
commoners
associate
for
all
sorts
of
work
such
habits
are
mentioned
by
nearly
all
those
who
have
written
upon
french
village
life
but
it
will
perhaps
be
better
to
give
in
this
place
some
abstracts
from
letters
which
i
have
just
received
from
a
friend
of
mine
whom
i
have
asked
to
communicate
to
me
his
observations
on
this
subject
they
come
from
an
aged
man
who
for
years
has
been
the
mayor
of
his
commune
in
south
france
in
ariege
the
facts
he
mentions
are
known
to
him
from
long
years
of
personal
observation
and
they
have
the
advantage
of
coming
from
one
neighbourhood
instead
of
being
skimmed
from
a
large
area
some
of
them
may
seem
trifling
but
as
a
whole
they
depict
quite
a
little
world
of
village
life
in
several
communes
in
our
neighbourhood
my
friend
writes
the
old
custom
of
is
in
vigour
when
many
hands
are
required
in
a
metairie
for
rapidly
making
some
work
dig
out
potatoes
or
mow
the
grass
the
youth
of
the
neighbourhood
is
convoked
young
men
and
girls
come
in
numbers
make
it
gaily
and
for
nothing
and
in
the
evening
after
a
gay
meal
they
dance
in
the
same
communes
when
a
girl
is
going
to
marry
the
girls
of
the
neighbourhood
come
to
aid
in
sewing
the
dowry
in
several
communes
the
women
still
continue
to
spin
a
good
deal
when
the
winding
off
has
to
be
done
in
a
family
it
is
done
in
one
evening
all
friends
being
convoked
for
that
work
in
many
communes
of
the
ariege
and
other
parts
of
the
the
shelling
of
the
indian
is
also
done
by
all
the
neighbours
they
are
treated
with
chestnuts
and
wine
and
the
young
people
dance
after
the
work
has
been
done
the
same
custom
is
practised
for
making
nut
oil
and
crushing
hemp
in
the
commune
of
the
same
is
done
for
bringing
in
the
corn
crops
these
days
of
hard
work
become
fete
days
as
the
owner
stakes
his
honour
on
serving
a
good
meal
no
remuneration
is
given
all
do
it
for
each
other
in
the
commune
of
the
common
is
every
year
increased
so
that
nearly
the
whole
of
the
land
of
the
commune
is
now
kept
in
common
the
shepherds
are
elected
by
all
owners
of
the
cattle
including
women
the
bulls
are
communal
in
the
commune
of
the
forty
to
fifty
small
sheep
flocks
of
the
commoners
are
brought
together
and
divided
into
three
or
four
flocks
before
being
sent
to
the
higher
meadows
each
owner
goes
for
a
week
to
serve
as
shepherd
in
the
hamlet
of
a
threshing
machine
has
been
bought
in
common
by
several
households
the
fifteen
to
twenty
persons
required
to
serve
the
machine
being
supplied
by
all
the
families
three
other
threshing
machines
have
been
bought
and
are
rented
out
by
their
owners
but
the
work
is
performed
by
outside
helpers
invited
in
the
usual
way
in
our
commune
of
we
had
to
raise
the
wall
of
the
cemetery
half
of
the
money
which
was
required
for
buying
lime
and
for
the
wages
of
the
skilled
workers
was
supplied
by
the
county
council
and
the
other
half
by
subscription
as
to
the
work
of
carrying
sand
and
water
making
mortar
and
serving
the
masons
it
was
done
entirely
by
volunteers
just
as
in
the
kabyle
djemmaa
the
rural
roads
were
repaired
in
the
same
way
by
volunteer
days
of
work
given
by
the
commoners
other
communes
have
built
in
the
same
way
their
fountains
the
and
other
smaller
appliances
are
frequently
kept
by
the
commune
two
residents
of
the
same
neighbourhood
questioned
by
my
friend
add
the
following
at
a
few
years
ago
there
was
no
mill
the
commune
has
built
one
levying
a
tax
upon
the
commoners
as
to
the
miller
they
decided
in
order
to
avoid
frauds
and
partiality
that
he
should
be
paid
two
francs
for
each
and
the
corn
be
ground
free
at
few
peasants
are
insured
against
fire
when
a
conflagration
has
taken
place
so
it
was
lately
all
give
something
to
the
family
which
has
suffered
from
it
a
chaldron
a
a
chair
and
so
on
and
a
modest
household
is
thus
reconstituted
all
the
neighbours
aid
to
build
the
house
and
in
the
meantime
the
family
is
lodged
free
by
the
neighbours
such
habits
of
mutual
support
of
which
many
more
examples
could
be
given
undoubtedly
account
for
the
easiness
with
which
the
french
peasants
associate
for
using
in
turn
the
plough
with
its
team
of
horses
the
and
the
threshing
machine
when
they
are
kept
in
the
village
by
one
of
them
only
as
well
as
for
the
performance
of
all
sorts
of
rural
work
in
common
canals
were
maintained
forests
were
cleared
trees
were
planted
and
marshes
were
drained
by
the
village
communities
from
time
immemorial
and
the
same
continues
still
quite
lately
in
la
borne
of
lozere
barren
hills
were
turned
into
rich
gardens
by
communal
work
the
soil
was
brought
on
men
backs
terraces
were
made
and
planted
with
chestnut
trees
peach
trees
and
orchards
and
water
was
brought
for
irrigation
in
canals
two
or
three
miles
long
just
now
they
have
dug
a
new
canal
eleven
miles
in
length
to
the
same
spirit
is
also
due
the
remarkable
success
lately
obtained
by
the
syndicats
agricoles
or
peasants
and
farmers
associations
it
was
not
until
that
associations
of
more
than
nineteen
persons
were
permitted
in
france
and
i
need
not
say
that
when
this
dangerous
experiment
was
ventured
upon
so
it
was
styled
in
the
chambers
all
due
precautions
which
functionaries
can
invent
were
taken
notwithstanding
all
that
france
begins
to
be
covered
with
syndicates
at
the
outset
they
were
only
formed
for
buying
manures
and
seeds
falsification
having
attained
colossal
proportions
in
these
two
branches
but
gradually
they
extended
their
functions
in
various
directions
including
the
sale
of
agricultural
produce
and
permanent
improvements
of
the
land
in
south
france
the
ravages
of
the
phylloxera
have
called
into
existence
a
great
number
of
associations
ten
to
thirty
growers
form
a
syndicate
buy
a
for
pumping
water
and
make
the
necessary
arrangements
for
inundating
their
vineyards
in
turn
new
associations
for
protecting
the
land
from
inundations
for
irrigation
purposes
and
for
maintaining
canals
are
continually
formed
and
the
unanimity
of
all
peasants
of
a
neighbourhood
which
is
required
by
law
is
no
obstacle
elsewhere
we
have
the
fruitieres
or
dairy
associations
in
some
of
which
all
butter
and
cheese
is
divided
in
equal
parts
irrespective
of
the
yield
of
each
cow
in
the
ariege
we
find
an
association
of
eight
separate
communes
for
the
common
culture
of
their
lands
which
they
have
put
together
syndicates
for
free
medical
aid
have
been
formed
in
communes
out
of
in
the
same
department
associations
of
consumers
arise
in
connection
with
the
syndicates
and
so
on
quite
a
revolution
is
going
on
in
our
villages
alfred
baudrillart
writes
through
these
associations
which
take
in
each
region
their
own
special
characters
very
much
the
same
must
be
said
of
germany
wherever
the
peasants
could
resist
the
plunder
of
their
lands
they
have
retained
them
in
communal
ownership
which
largely
prevails
in
wurttemberg
baden
hohenzollern
and
in
the
hessian
province
of
starkenberg
the
communal
forests
are
kept
as
a
rule
in
an
excellent
state
and
in
thousands
of
communes
timber
and
fuel
wood
are
divided
every
year
among
all
inhabitants
even
the
old
custom
of
the
lesholztag
is
widely
spread
at
the
ringing
of
the
village
bell
all
go
to
the
forest
to
take
as
much
fuel
wood
as
they
can
carry
in
westphalia
one
finds
communes
in
which
all
the
land
is
cultivated
as
one
common
estate
in
accordance
with
all
requirements
of
modern
agronomy
as
to
the
old
communal
customs
and
habits
they
are
in
vigour
in
most
parts
of
germany
the
calling
in
of
aids
which
are
real
fetes
of
labour
is
known
to
be
quite
habitual
in
westphalia
hesse
and
nassau
in
regions
the
timber
for
a
new
house
is
usually
taken
from
the
communal
forest
and
all
the
neighbours
join
in
building
the
house
even
in
the
suburbs
of
frankfort
it
is
a
regular
custom
among
the
gardeners
that
in
case
of
one
of
them
being
ill
all
come
on
sunday
to
cultivate
his
garden
in
germany
as
in
france
as
soon
as
the
rulers
of
the
people
repealed
their
laws
against
the
peasant
associations
that
was
only
in
these
unions
began
to
develop
with
a
wonderful
rapidity
notwithstanding
all
legal
obstacles
which
were
put
in
their
way
it
is
a
fact
buchenberger
says
that
in
thousands
of
village
communities
in
which
no
sort
of
chemical
manure
or
rational
fodder
was
ever
known
both
have
become
of
everyday
use
to
a
quite
unforeseen
extent
owing
to
these
associations
vol
ii
all
sorts
of
implements
and
agricultural
machinery
and
better
breeds
of
cattle
are
bought
through
the
associations
and
various
arrangements
for
improving
the
quality
of
the
produce
begin
to
be
introduced
unions
for
the
sale
of
agricultural
produce
are
also
formed
as
well
as
for
permanent
improvements
of
the
land
from
the
point
of
view
of
social
economics
all
these
efforts
of
the
peasants
certainly
are
of
little
importance
they
can
not
substantially
and
still
less
permanently
alleviate
the
misery
to
which
the
tillers
of
the
soil
are
doomed
all
over
europe
but
from
the
ethical
point
of
view
which
we
are
now
considering
their
importance
can
not
be
overrated
they
prove
that
even
under
the
system
of
reckless
individualism
which
now
prevails
the
agricultural
masses
piously
maintain
their
inheritance
and
as
soon
as
the
states
relax
the
iron
laws
by
means
of
which
they
have
broken
all
bonds
between
men
these
bonds
are
at
once
reconstituted
notwithstanding
the
difficulties
political
economical
and
social
which
are
many
and
in
such
forms
as
best
answer
to
the
modern
requirements
of
production
they
indicate
in
which
direction
and
in
which
form
further
progress
must
be
expected
i
might
easily
multiply
such
illustrations
taking
them
from
italy
spain
denmark
and
so
on
and
pointing
out
some
interesting
features
which
are
proper
to
each
of
these
countries
the
slavonian
populations
of
austria
and
the
balkan
peninsula
among
whom
the
compound
family
or
undivided
household
is
found
in
existence
ought
also
to
be
mentioned
but
i
hasten
to
pass
on
to
russia
where
the
same
tendency
takes
certain
new
and
unforeseen
forms
moreover
in
dealing
with
the
village
community
in
russia
we
have
the
advantage
of
possessing
an
immense
mass
of
materials
collected
during
the
colossal
inquest
which
was
lately
made
by
several
zemstvos
county
councils
and
which
embraces
a
population
of
nearly
peasants
in
different
parts
of
the
country
two
important
conclusions
may
be
drawn
from
the
bulk
of
evidence
collected
by
the
russian
inquests
in
middle
russia
where
fully
of
the
peasants
have
been
brought
to
utter
ruin
by
heavy
taxation
small
allotments
of
unproductive
land
rack
rents
and
very
severe
after
total
failures
of
crops
there
was
during
the
first
years
after
the
emancipation
of
the
serfs
a
decided
tendency
towards
the
constitution
of
individual
property
in
land
within
the
village
communities
many
impoverished
horseless
peasants
abandoned
their
allotments
and
this
land
often
became
the
property
of
those
richer
peasants
who
borrow
additional
incomes
from
trade
or
of
outside
traders
who
buy
land
chiefly
for
exacting
rack
rents
from
the
peasants
it
must
also
be
added
that
a
flaw
in
the
land
redemption
law
of
offered
great
facilities
for
buying
peasants
lands
at
a
very
small
expense
and
that
the
state
officials
mostly
used
their
weighty
influence
in
favour
of
individual
as
against
communal
ownership
however
for
the
last
twenty
years
a
strong
wind
of
opposition
to
the
individual
appropriation
of
the
land
blows
again
through
the
middle
russian
villages
and
strenuous
efforts
are
being
made
by
the
bulk
of
those
peasants
who
stand
between
the
rich
and
the
very
poor
to
uphold
the
village
community
as
to
the
fertile
steppes
of
the
south
which
are
now
the
most
populous
and
the
richest
part
of
european
russia
they
were
mostly
colonized
during
the
present
century
under
the
system
of
individual
ownership
or
occupation
sanctioned
in
that
form
by
the
state
but
since
improved
methods
of
agriculture
with
the
aid
of
machinery
have
been
introduced
in
the
region
the
peasant
owners
have
gradually
begun
themselves
to
transform
their
individual
ownership
into
communal
possession
and
one
finds
now
in
that
granary
of
russia
a
very
great
number
of
spontaneously
formed
village
communities
of
recent
origin
the
crimea
and
the
part
of
the
mainland
which
lies
to
the
north
of
it
the
province
of
taurida
for
which
we
have
detailed
data
offer
an
excellent
illustration
of
that
movement
this
territory
began
to
be
colonized
after
its
annexation
in
by
great
little
and
white
russians
cossacks
freemen
and
runaway
serfs
who
came
individually
or
in
small
groups
from
all
corners
of
russia
they
took
first
to
and
when
they
began
later
on
to
till
the
soil
each
one
tilled
as
much
as
he
could
afford
to
but
when
immigration
continuing
and
perfected
ploughs
being
introduced
land
stood
in
great
demand
bitter
disputes
arose
among
the
settlers
they
lasted
for
years
until
these
men
previously
tied
by
no
mutual
bonds
gradually
came
to
the
idea
that
an
end
must
be
put
to
disputes
by
introducing
ownership
they
passed
decisions
to
the
effect
that
the
land
which
they
owned
individually
should
henceforward
be
their
common
property
and
they
began
to
allot
and
to
it
in
accordance
with
the
usual
rules
the
movement
gradually
took
a
great
extension
and
on
a
small
territory
the
taurida
statisticians
found
villages
in
which
communal
ownership
had
been
introduced
by
the
peasant
proprietors
themselves
chiefly
in
the
years
in
lieu
of
individual
ownership
quite
a
variety
of
types
has
been
freely
worked
out
in
this
way
by
the
settlers
what
adds
to
the
interest
of
this
transformation
is
that
it
took
place
not
only
among
the
great
russians
who
are
used
to
life
but
also
among
little
russians
who
have
long
since
forgotten
it
under
polish
rule
among
greeks
and
bulgarians
and
even
among
germans
who
have
long
since
worked
out
in
their
prosperous
and
volga
colonies
their
own
type
of
village
community
it
is
evident
that
the
mussulman
tartars
of
taurida
hold
their
land
under
the
mussulman
customary
law
which
is
limited
personal
occupation
but
even
with
them
the
european
village
community
has
been
introduced
in
a
few
cases
as
to
other
nationalities
in
taurida
individual
ownership
has
been
abolished
in
six
esthonian
two
greek
two
bulgarian
one
czech
and
one
german
village
this
movement
is
characteristic
for
the
whole
of
the
fertile
steppe
region
of
the
south
but
separate
instances
of
it
are
also
found
in
little
russia
thus
in
a
number
of
villages
of
the
province
of
chernigov
the
peasants
were
formerly
individual
owners
of
their
plots
they
had
separate
legal
documents
for
their
plots
and
used
to
rent
and
to
sell
their
land
at
will
but
in
the
fifties
of
the
nineteenth
century
a
movement
began
among
them
in
favour
of
communal
possession
the
chief
argument
being
the
growing
number
of
pauper
families
the
initiative
of
the
reform
was
taken
in
one
village
and
the
others
followed
suit
the
last
case
on
record
dating
from
of
course
there
were
struggles
between
the
poor
who
usually
claim
for
communal
possession
and
the
rich
who
usually
prefer
individual
ownership
and
the
struggles
often
lasted
for
years
in
certain
places
the
unanimity
required
then
by
the
law
being
impossible
to
obtain
the
village
divided
into
two
villages
one
under
individual
ownership
and
the
other
under
communal
possession
and
so
they
remained
until
the
two
coalesced
into
one
community
or
else
they
remained
divided
still
as
to
middle
russia
its
a
fact
that
in
many
villages
which
were
drifting
towards
individual
ownership
there
began
since
a
mass
movement
in
favour
of
the
village
community
even
peasant
proprietors
who
had
lived
for
years
under
the
individualist
system
returned
en
masse
to
the
communal
institutions
thus
there
is
a
considerable
number
of
who
have
received
part
only
of
the
regulation
allotments
but
they
have
received
them
free
of
redemption
and
in
individual
ownership
there
was
in
a
movement
among
them
in
kursk
ryazan
tambov
orel
etc
towards
putting
their
allotments
together
and
introducing
the
village
community
the
free
agriculturists
volnyie
khlebopashtsy
who
were
liberated
from
serfdom
under
the
law
of
and
had
bought
their
allotments
each
family
separately
are
now
nearly
all
under
the
system
which
they
have
introduced
themselves
all
these
movements
are
of
recent
origin
and
too
join
them
thus
the
bulgares
in
the
district
of
tiraspol
after
having
remained
for
sixty
years
under
the
system
introduced
the
village
community
in
the
years
the
german
mennonites
of
berdyansk
fought
in
for
introducing
the
village
community
and
the
small
peasant
proprietors
kleinwirthschaftliche
among
the
german
baptists
were
agitating
in
their
villages
in
the
same
direction
one
instance
more
in
the
province
of
samara
the
russian
government
created
in
the
forties
by
way
of
experiment
villages
on
the
system
of
individual
ownership
each
household
received
a
splendid
property
of
acres
in
out
of
the
villages
the
peasants
in
had
already
notified
the
desire
of
introducing
the
village
community
i
take
all
these
facts
from
the
excellent
work
of
who
simply
gives
in
a
classified
form
the
facts
recorded
in
the
inquest
this
movement
in
favour
of
communal
possession
runs
badly
against
the
current
economical
theories
according
to
which
intensive
culture
is
incompatible
with
the
village
community
but
the
most
charitable
thing
that
can
be
said
of
these
theories
is
that
they
have
never
been
submitted
to
the
test
of
experiment
they
belong
to
the
domain
of
political
metaphysics
the
facts
which
we
have
before
us
show
on
the
contrary
that
wherever
the
russian
peasants
owing
to
a
concurrence
of
favourable
circumstances
are
less
miserable
than
they
are
on
the
average
and
wherever
they
find
men
of
knowledge
and
initiative
among
their
neighbours
the
village
community
becomes
the
very
means
for
introducing
various
improvements
in
agriculture
and
village
life
altogether
here
as
elsewhere
mutual
aid
is
a
better
leader
to
progress
than
the
war
of
each
against
all
as
may
be
seen
from
the
following
facts
under
nicholas
the
first
rule
many
crown
officials
and
used
to
compel
the
peasants
to
introduce
the
communal
culture
of
small
plots
of
the
village
lands
in
order
to
refill
the
communal
storehouses
after
loans
of
grain
had
been
granted
to
the
poorest
commoners
such
cultures
connected
in
the
peasants
minds
with
the
worst
reminiscences
of
serfdom
were
abandoned
as
soon
as
serfdom
was
abolished
but
now
the
peasants
begin
to
reintroduce
them
on
their
own
account
in
one
district
ostrogozhsk
in
kursk
the
initiative
of
one
person
was
sufficient
to
call
them
to
life
in
of
all
the
villages
the
same
is
met
with
in
several
other
localities
on
a
given
day
the
commoners
come
out
the
richer
ones
with
a
plough
or
a
cart
and
the
poorer
ones
and
no
attempt
is
made
to
discriminate
one
share
in
the
work
the
crop
is
afterwards
used
for
loans
to
the
poorer
commoners
mostly
free
grants
or
for
the
orphans
and
widows
or
for
the
village
church
or
for
the
school
or
for
repaying
a
communal
debt
that
all
sorts
of
work
which
enters
so
to
say
in
the
routine
of
village
life
repair
of
roads
and
bridges
dams
drainage
supply
of
water
for
irrigation
cutting
of
wood
planting
of
trees
etc
are
made
by
whole
communes
and
that
land
is
rented
and
meadows
are
mown
by
whole
communes
the
work
being
accomplished
by
old
and
young
men
and
women
in
the
way
described
by
tolstoi
is
only
what
one
may
expect
from
people
living
under
the
system
they
are
of
everyday
occurrence
all
over
the
country
but
the
village
community
is
also
by
no
means
averse
to
modern
agricultural
improvements
when
it
can
stand
the
expense
and
when
knowledge
hitherto
kept
for
the
rich
only
finds
its
way
into
the
peasant
house
it
has
just
been
said
that
perfected
ploughs
rapidly
spread
in
south
russia
and
in
many
cases
the
village
communities
were
instrumental
in
spreading
their
use
a
plough
was
bought
by
the
community
experimented
upon
on
a
portion
of
the
communal
land
and
the
necessary
improvements
were
indicated
to
the
makers
whom
the
communes
often
aided
in
starting
the
manufacture
of
cheap
ploughs
as
a
village
industry
in
the
district
of
moscow
where
ploughs
were
lately
bought
by
the
peasants
during
five
years
the
impulse
came
from
those
communes
which
rented
lands
as
a
body
for
the
special
purpose
of
improved
culture
in
the
vyatka
small
associations
of
peasants
who
travel
with
their
winnowing
machines
manufactured
as
a
village
industry
in
one
of
the
iron
districts
have
spread
the
use
of
such
machines
in
the
neighbouring
governments
the
very
wide
spread
of
threshing
machines
in
samara
saratov
and
kherson
is
due
to
the
peasant
associations
which
can
afford
to
buy
a
costly
engine
while
the
individual
peasant
can
not
and
while
we
read
in
nearly
all
economical
treatises
that
the
village
community
was
doomed
to
disappear
when
the
system
had
to
be
substituted
by
the
rotation
of
crops
system
we
see
in
russia
many
village
communities
taking
the
initiative
of
introducing
the
rotation
of
crops
before
accepting
it
the
peasants
usually
set
apart
a
portion
of
the
communal
fields
for
an
experiment
in
artificial
meadows
and
the
commune
buys
the
seeds
if
the
experiment
proves
successful
they
find
no
difficulty
whatever
in
their
fields
so
as
to
suit
the
five
or
six
fields
system
this
system
is
now
in
use
in
hundreds
of
villages
of
moscow
tver
smolensk
vyatka
and
pskov
and
where
land
can
be
spared
the
communities
give
also
a
portion
of
their
domain
to
allotments
for
finally
the
sudden
extension
lately
taken
in
russia
by
the
little
model
farms
orchards
kitchen
gardens
and
grounds
which
are
started
at
the
village
under
the
conduct
of
the
or
of
a
village
volunteer
is
also
due
to
the
support
they
found
with
the
village
communities
moreover
such
permanent
improvements
as
drainage
and
irrigation
are
of
frequent
occurrence
for
instance
in
three
districts
of
the
province
of
moscow
industrial
to
a
great
extent
drainage
works
have
been
accomplished
within
the
last
ten
years
on
a
large
scale
in
no
less
than
to
different
villages
the
commoners
working
themselves
with
the
spade
at
another
extremity
of
russia
in
the
dry
steppes
of
novouzen
over
a
thousand
dams
for
ponds
were
built
and
several
hundreds
of
deep
wells
were
sunk
by
the
communes
while
in
a
wealthy
german
colony
of
the
the
commoners
worked
men
and
women
alike
for
five
weeks
in
succession
to
erect
a
dam
two
miles
long
for
irrigation
purposes
what
could
isolated
men
do
in
that
struggle
against
the
dry
climate
what
could
they
obtain
through
individual
effort
when
south
russia
was
struck
with
the
marmot
plague
and
all
people
living
on
the
land
rich
and
poor
commoners
and
individualists
had
to
work
with
their
hands
in
order
to
conjure
the
plague
to
call
in
the
policeman
would
have
been
of
no
use
to
associate
was
the
only
possible
remedy
and
now
after
having
said
so
much
about
mutual
aid
and
support
which
are
practised
by
the
tillers
of
the
soil
in
civilized
countries
i
see
that
i
might
fill
an
octavo
volume
with
illustrations
taken
from
the
life
of
the
hundreds
of
millions
of
men
who
also
live
under
the
tutorship
of
more
or
less
centralized
states
but
are
out
of
touch
with
modern
civilization
and
modern
ideas
i
might
describe
the
inner
life
of
a
turkish
village
and
its
network
of
admirable
customs
and
habits
on
turning
over
my
leaflets
covered
with
illustrations
from
peasant
life
in
caucasia
i
come
across
touching
facts
of
mutual
support
i
trace
the
same
customs
in
the
arab
djemmaa
and
the
afghan
purra
in
the
villages
of
persia
india
and
java
in
the
undivided
family
of
the
chinese
in
the
encampments
of
the
of
central
asia
and
the
nomads
of
the
far
north
on
consulting
notes
taken
at
random
in
the
literature
of
africa
i
find
them
replete
with
similar
facts
of
aids
convoked
to
take
in
the
crops
of
houses
built
by
all
inhabitants
of
the
village
sometimes
to
repair
the
havoc
done
by
civilized
filibusters
of
people
aiding
each
other
in
case
of
accident
protecting
the
traveller
and
so
on
and
when
i
peruse
such
works
as
post
compendium
of
african
customary
law
i
understand
why
notwithstanding
all
tyranny
oppression
robberies
and
raids
tribal
wars
glutton
kings
deceiving
witches
and
priests
and
the
like
these
populations
have
not
gone
astray
in
the
woods
why
they
have
maintained
a
certain
civilization
and
have
remained
men
instead
of
dropping
to
the
level
of
straggling
families
of
decaying
the
fact
is
that
the
the
ivory
robbers
the
fighting
kings
the
matabele
and
the
madagascar
heroes
pass
away
leaving
their
traces
marked
with
blood
and
fire
but
the
nucleus
of
institutions
habits
and
customs
grown
up
in
the
tribe
and
the
village
community
remains
and
it
keeps
men
united
in
societies
open
to
the
progress
of
civilization
and
ready
to
receive
it
when
the
day
comes
that
they
shall
receive
civilization
instead
of
bullets
the
same
applies
to
our
civilized
world
the
natural
and
social
calamities
pass
away
whole
populations
are
periodically
reduced
to
misery
or
starvation
the
very
springs
of
life
are
crushed
out
of
millions
of
men
reduced
to
city
pauperism
the
understanding
and
the
feelings
of
the
millions
are
vitiated
by
teachings
worked
out
in
the
interest
of
the
few
all
this
is
certainly
a
part
of
our
existence
but
the
nucleus
of
institutions
habits
and
customs
remains
alive
with
the
millions
it
keeps
them
together
and
they
prefer
to
cling
to
their
customs
beliefs
and
traditions
rather
than
to
accept
the
teachings
of
a
war
of
each
against
all
which
are
offered
to
them
under
the
title
of

when
we
examine
the
life
of

rural
populations
of
europe
we
find
that
notwithstanding
all
that
has
been
done
in
modern
states
for
the
destruction
of
the
village
community
the
life
of
the
peasants
remains
honeycombed
with
habits
and
customs
of
mutual
aid
and
support
that
important
vestiges
of
the
communal
possession
of
the
soil
are
still
retained
and
that
as
soon
as
the
legal
obstacles
to
rural
association
were
lately
removed
a
network
of
free
unions
for
all
sorts
of
economical
purposes
rapidly
spread
among
the
peasants
the
tendency
of
this
young
movement
being
to
reconstitute
some
sort
of
union
similar
to
the
village
community
of
old
such
being
the
conclusions
arrived
at
in
the
preceding
chapter
we
have
now
to
consider
what
institutions
for
mutual
support
can
be
found
at
the
present
time
amongst
the
industrial
populations
for
the
last
three
hundred
years
the
conditions
for
the
growth
of
such
institutions
have
been
as
unfavourable
in
the
towns
as
they
have
been
in
the
villages
it
is
well
known
indeed
that
when
the
medieval
cities
were
subdued
in
the
sixteenth
century
by
growing
military
states
all
institutions
which
kept
the
artisans
the
masters
and
the
merchants
together
in
the
guilds
and
the
cities
were
violently
destroyed
the
and
the
of
both
the
guild
and
the
city
were
abolished
the
oath
of
allegiance
between
became
an
act
of
felony
towards
the
state
the
properties
of
the
guilds
were
confiscated
in
the
same
way
as
the
lands
of
the
village
communities
and
the
inner
and
technical
organization
of
each
trade
was
taken
in
hand
by
the
state
laws
gradually
growing
in
severity
were
passed
to
prevent
artisans
from
combining
in
any
way
for
a
time
some
shadows
of
the
old
guilds
were
tolerated
merchants
guilds
were
allowed
to
exist
under
the
condition
of
freely
granting
subsidies
to
the
kings
and
some
artisan
guilds
were
kept
in
existence
as
organs
of
administration
some
of
them
still
drag
on
their
meaningless
existence
but
what
formerly
was
the
vital
force
of
medieval
life
and
industry
has
long
since
disappeared
under
the
crushing
weight
of
the
centralized
state
in
great
britain
which
may
be
taken
as
the
best
illustration
of
the
industrial
policy
of
the
modern
states
we
see
the
parliament
beginning
the
destruction
of
the
guilds
as
early
as
the
fifteenth
century
but
it
was
especially
in
the
next
century
that
decisive
measures
were
taken
henry
the
eighth
not
only
ruined
the
organization
of
the
guilds
but
also
confiscated
their
properties
with
even
less
excuse
and
manners
as
toulmin
smith
wrote
than
he
had
produced
for
confiscating
the
estates
of
the
monasteries
edward
the
sixth
completed
his
work
and
already
in
the
second
part
of
the
sixteenth
century
we
find
the
parliament
settling
all
the
disputes
between
craftsmen
and
merchants
which
formerly
were
settled
in
each
city
separately
the
parliament
and
the
king
not
only
legislated
in
all
such
contests
but
keeping
in
view
the
interests
of
the
crown
in
the
exports
they
soon
began
to
determine
the
number
of
apprentices
in
each
trade
and
minutely
to
regulate
the
very
technics
of
each
fabrication
the
weights
of
the
stuffs
the
number
of
threads
in
the
yard
of
cloth
and
the
like
with
little
success
it
must
be
said
because
contests
and
technical
difficulties
which
were
arranged
for
centuries
in
succession
by
agreement
between
guilds
and
federated
cities
lay
entirely
beyond
the
powers
of
the
centralized
state
the
continual
interference
of
its
officials
paralyzed
the
trades
bringing
most
of
them
to
a
complete
decay
and
the
last
century
economists
when
they
rose
against
the
state
regulation
of
industries
only
ventilated
a
discontent
the
abolition
of
that
interference
by
the
french
revolution
was
greeted
as
an
act
of
liberation
and
the
example
of
france
was
soon
followed
elsewhere
with
the
regulation
of
wages
the
state
had
no
better
success
in
the
medieval
cities
when
the
distinction
between
masters
and
apprentices
or
journeymen
became
more
and
more
apparent
in
the
fifteenth
century
unions
of
apprentices
gesellenverbande
occasionally
assuming
an
international
character
were
opposed
to
the
unions
of
masters
and
merchants
now
it
was
the
state
which
undertook
to
settle
their
griefs
and
under
the
elizabethan
statute
of
the
justices
of
peace
had
to
settle
the
wages
so
as
to
guarantee
a
convenient
livelihood
to
journeymen
and
apprentices
the
justices
however
proved
helpless
to
conciliate
the
conflicting
interests
and
still
less
to
compel
the
masters
to
obey
their
decisions
the
law
gradually
became
a
dead
letter
and
was
repealed
by
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
but
while
the
state
thus
abandoned
the
function
of
regulating
wages
it
continued
severely
to
prohibit
all
combinations
which
were
entered
upon
by
journeymen
and
workers
in
order
to
raise
their
wages
or
to
keep
them
at
a
certain
level
all
through
the
eighteenth
century
it
legislated
against
the
workers
unions
and
in
it
finally
prohibited
all
sorts
of
combinations
under
the
menace
of
severe
punishments
in
fact
the
british
parliament
only
followed
in
this
case
the
example
of
the
french
revolutionary
convention
which
had
issued
a
draconic
law
against
coalitions
of
between
a
number
of
citizens
being
considered
as
attempts
against
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
which
was
supposed
equally
to
protect
all
its
subjects
the
work
of
destruction
of
the
medieval
unions
was
thus
completed
both
in
the
town
and
in
the
village
the
state
reigned
over
loose
aggregations
of
individuals
and
was
ready
to
prevent
by
the
most
stringent
measures
the
reconstitution
of
any
sort
of
separate
unions
among
them
these
were
then
the
conditions
under
which
the
tendency
had
to
make
its
way
in
the
nineteenth
century
need
it
be
said
that
no
such
measures
could
destroy
that
tendency
throughout
the
eighteenth
century
the
workers
unions
were
continually
reconstituted
nor
were
they
stopped
by
the
cruel
prosecutions
which
took
place
under
the
laws
of
and
every
flaw
in
supervision
every
delay
of
the
masters
in
denouncing
the
unions
was
taken
advantage
of
under
the
cover
of
friendly
societies
burial
clubs
or
secret
brotherhoods
the
unions
spread
in
the
textile
industries
among
the
sheffield
cutlers
the
miners
and
vigorous
federal
organizations
were
formed
to
support
the
branches
during
strikes
and
prosecutions
the
repeal
of
the
combination
laws
in
gave
a
new
impulse
to
the
movement
unions
and
national
federations
were
formed
in
all
trades
and
when
robert
owen
started
his
grand
national
consolidated
union
it
mustered
half
a
million
members
in
a
few
months
true
that
this
period
of
relative
liberty
did
not
last
long
prosecution
began
anew
in
the
thirties
and
the
ferocious
condemnations
of
followed
the
grand
national
union
was
disbanded
and
all
over
the
country
both
the
private
employers
and
the
government
in
its
own
workshops
began
to
compel
the
workers
to
resign
all
connection
with
unions
and
to
sign
the
document
to
that
effect
unionists
were
prosecuted
wholesale
under
the
master
and
servant
act
workers
being
summarily
arrested
and
condemned
upon
a
mere
complaint
of
misbehaviour
lodged
by
the
master
strikes
were
suppressed
in
an
autocratic
way
and
the
most
astounding
condemnations
took
place
for
merely
having
announced
a
strike
or
acted
as
a
delegate
in
it
to
say
nothing
of
the
military
suppression
of
strike
riots
nor
of
the
condemnations
which
followed
the
frequent
outbursts
of
acts
of
violence
to
practise
mutual
support
under
such
circumstances
was
anything
but
an
easy
task
and
yet
notwithstanding
all
obstacles
of
which
our
own
generation
hardly
can
have
an
idea
the
revival
of
the
unions
began
again
in
and
the
amalgamation
of
the
workers
has
been
steadily
continued
since
after
a
long
fight
which
lasted
for
over
a
hundred
years
the
right
of
combining
together
was
conquered
and
at
the
present
time
nearly
part
of
the
workers
about
belong
to
trade
unions
as
to
the
other
european
states
sufficient
to
say
that
up
to
a
very
recent
date
all
sorts
of
unions
were
prosecuted
as
conspiracies
and
that
nevertheless
they
exist
everywhere
even
though
they
must
often
take
the
form
of
secret
societies
while
the
extension
and
the
force
of
labour
organizations
and
especially
of
the
knights
of
labour
in
the
united
states
and
in
belgium
have
been
sufficiently
illustrated
by
strikes
in
the
nineties
it
must
however
be
borne
in
mind
that
prosecution
apart
the
mere
fact
of
belonging
to
a
labour
union
implies
considerable
sacrifices
in
money
in
time
and
in
unpaid
work
and
continually
implies
the
risk
of
losing
employment
for
the
mere
fact
of
being
a
unionist
there
is
moreover
the
strike
which
a
unionist
has
continually
to
face
and
the
grim
reality
of
a
strike
is
that
the
limited
credit
of
a
worker
family
at
the
baker
and
the
is
soon
exhausted
the
goes
not
far
even
for
food
and
hunger
is
soon
written
on
the
children
faces
for
one
who
lives
in
close
contact
with
workers
a
protracted
strike
is
the
most
heartrending
sight
while
what
a
strike
meant
forty
years
ago
in
this
country
and
still
means
in
all
but
the
wealthiest
parts
of
the
continent
can
easily
be
conceived
continually
even
now
strikes
will
end
with
the
total
ruin
and
the
forced
emigration
of
whole
populations
while
the
shooting
down
of
strikers
on
the
slightest
provocation
or
even
without
any
provocation
is
quite
habitual
still
on
the
continent
and
yet
every
year
there
are
thousands
of
strikes
and
in
europe
and
america
the
most
severe
and
protracted
contests
being
as
a
rule
the
sympathy
strikes
which
are
entered
upon
to
support
comrades
or
to
maintain
the
rights
of
the
unions
and
while
a
portion
of
the
press
is
prone
to
explain
strikes
by
intimidation
those
who
have
lived
among
strikers
speak
with
admiration
of
the
mutual
aid
and
support
which
are
constantly
practised
by
them
every
one
has
heard
of
the
colossal
amount
of
work
which
was
done
by
volunteer
workers
for
organizing
relief
during
the
london
strike
of
the
miners
who
after
having
themselves
been
idle
for
many
weeks
paid
a
levy
of
four
shillings
a
week
to
the
strike
fund
when
they
resumed
work
of
the
miner
widow
who
during
the
yorkshire
labour
war
of
brought
her
husband
to
the
of
the
last
loaf
of
bread
being
always
shared
with
neighbours
of
the
radstock
miners
favoured
with
larger
who
invited
four
hundred
bristol
miners
to
take
their
share
of
cabbage
and
potatoes
and
so
on
all
newspaper
correspondents
during
the
great
strike
of
miners
in
yorkshire
in
knew
heaps
of
such
facts
although
not
all
of
them
could
report
such
irrelevant
matters
to
their
respective
papers
unionism
is
not
however
the
only
form
in
which
the
worker
need
of
mutual
support
finds
its
expression
there
are
besides
the
political
associations
whose
activity
many
workers
consider
as
more
conducive
to
general
welfare
than
the
limited
as
they
are
now
in
their
purposes
of
course
the
mere
fact
of
belonging
to
a
political
body
can
not
be
taken
as
a
manifestation
of
the
tendency
we
all
know
that
politics
are
the
field
in
which
the
purely
egotistic
elements
of
society
enter
into
the
most
entangled
combinations
with
altruistic
aspirations
but
every
experienced
politician
knows
that
all
great
political
movements
were
fought
upon
large
and
often
distant
issues
and
that
those
of
them
were
the
strongest
which
provoked
most
disinterested
enthusiasm
all
great
historical
movements
have
had
this
character
and
for
our
own
generation
socialism
stands
in
that
case
paid
agitators
is
no
doubt
the
favourite
refrain
of
those
who
know
nothing
about
it
the
truth
however
is
that
to
speak
only
of
what
i
know
personally
if
i
had
kept
a
diary
for
the
last
years
and
inscribed
in
it
all
the
devotion
and
which
i
came
across
in
the
socialist
movement
the
reader
of
such
a
diary
would
have
had
the
word
heroism
constantly
on
his
lips
but
the
men
i
would
have
spoken
of
were
not
heroes
they
were
average
men
inspired
by
a
grand
idea
every
socialist
newspaper
and
there
are
hundreds
of
them
in
europe
alone
has
the
same
history
of
years
of
sacrifice
without
any
hope
of
reward
and
in
the
overwhelming
majority
of
cases
even
without
any
personal
ambition
i
have
seen
families
living
without
knowing
what
would
be
their
food
the
husband
boycotted
all
round
in
his
little
town
for
his
part
in
the
paper
and
the
wife
supporting
the
family
by
sewing
and
such
a
situation
lasting
for
years
until
the
family
would
retire
without
a
word
of
reproach
simply
saying
continue
we
can
hold
on
no
more
i
have
seen
men
dying
from
consumption
and
knowing
it
and
yet
knocking
about
in
snow
and
fog
to
prepare
meetings
speaking
at
meetings
within
a
few
weeks
from
death
and
only
then
retiring
to
the
hospital
with
the
words
now
friends
i
am
done
the
doctors
say
i
have
but
a
few
weeks
to
live
tell
the
comrades
that
i
shall
be
happy
if
they
come
to
see
me
i
have
seen
facts
which
would
be
described
as
idealization
if
i
told
them
in
this
place
and
the
very
names
of
these
men
hardly
known
outside
a
narrow
circle
of
friends
will
soon
be
forgotten
when
the
friends
too
have
passed
away
in
fact
i
do
know
myself
which
most
to
admire
the
unbounded
devotion
of
these
few
or
the
sum
total
of
petty
acts
of
devotion
of
the
great
number
every
quire
of
a
penny
paper
sold
every
meeting
every
hundred
votes
which
are
won
at
a
socialist
election
represent
an
amount
of
energy
and
sacrifices
of
which
no
outsider
has
the
faintest
idea
and
what
is
now
done
by
socialists
has
been
done
in
every
popular
and
advanced
party
political
and
religious
in
the
past
all
past
progress
has
been
promoted
by
like
men
and
by
a
like
devotion
especially
in
britain
is
often
described
as
individualism
and
such
as
it
is
now
it
undoubtedly
tends
to
breed
a
egotism
not
only
towards
the
community
at
large
but
also
among
the
themselves
it
is
nevertheless
certain
that
at
its
origin
the
movement
had
an
essentially
character
even
now
its
most
ardent
promoters
are
persuaded
that
leads
mankind
to
a
higher
harmonic
stage
of
economical
relations
and
it
is
not
possible
to
stay
in
some
of
the
strongholds
of
in
the
north
without
realizing
that
the
great
number
of
the
rank
and
file
hold
the
same
opinion
most
of
them
would
lose
interest
in
the
movement
if
that
faith
were
gone
and
it
must
be
owned
that
within
the
last
few
years
broader
ideals
of
general
welfare
and
of
the
producers
solidarity
have
begun
to
be
current
among
the
there
is
undoubtedly
now
a
tendency
towards
establishing
better
relations
between
the
owners
of
the
workshops
and
the
workers
the
importance
of
in
this
country
in
holland
and
in
denmark
is
well
known
while
in
germany
and
especially
on
the
rhine
the
societies
are
already
an
important
factor
of
industrial
life
it
is
however
russia
which
offers
perhaps
the
best
field
for
the
study
of
cooperation
under
an
infinite
variety
of
aspects
in
russia
it
is
a
natural
growth
an
inheritance
from
the
middle
ages
and
while
a
formally
established
society
would
have
to
cope
with
many
legal
difficulties
and
official
suspicion
the
informal
the
artel
makes
the
very
substance
of
russian
peasant
life
the
history
of
the
making
of
russia
and
of
the
colonization
of
siberia
is
a
history
of
the
hunting
and
trading
artels
or
guilds
followed
by
village
communities
and
at
the
present
time
we
find
the
artel
everywhere
among
each
group
of
ten
to
fifty
peasants
who
come
from
the
same
village
to
work
at
a
factory
in
all
the
building
trades
among
fishermen
and
hunters
among
convicts
on
their
way
to
and
in
siberia
among
railway
porters
exchange
messengers
customs
house
labourers
everywhere
in
the
village
industries
which
give
occupation
to
men
from
top
to
bottom
of
the
working
world
permanent
and
temporary
for
production
and
consumption
under
all
possible
aspects
until
now
many
of
the
on
the
tributaries
of
the
caspian
sea
are
held
by
immense
artels
the
ural
river
belonging
to
the
whole
of
the
ural
cossacks
who
allot
and
the
perhaps
the
richest
in
the
world
among
the
villages
without
any
interference
of
the
authorities
fishing
is
always
made
by
artels
in
the
ural
the
volga
and
all
the
lakes
of
northern
russia
besides
these
permanent
organizations
there
are
the
simply
countless
temporary
artels
constituted
for
each
special
purpose
when
ten
or
twenty
peasants
come
from
some
locality
to
a
big
town
to
work
as
weavers
carpenters
masons
and
so
on
they
always
constitute
an
artel
they
hire
rooms
hire
a
cook
very
often
the
wife
of
one
of
them
acts
in
this
capacity
elect
an
elder
and
take
their
meals
in
common
each
one
paying
his
share
for
food
and
lodging
to
the
artel
a
party
of
convicts
on
its
way
to
siberia
always
does
the
same
and
its
elected
elder
is
the
intermediary
between
the
convicts
and
the
military
chief
of
the
party
in
the
prisons
they
have
the
same
organization
the
railway
porters
the
messengers
at
the
exchange
the
workers
at
the
custom
house
the
town
messengers
in
the
capitals
who
are
collectively
responsible
for
each
member
enjoy
such
a
reputation
that
any
amount
of
money
or
is
trusted
to
the
by
the
merchants
in
the
building
trades
artels
of
from
to
members
are
formed
and
the
serious
builders
and
railway
contractors
always
prefer
to
deal
with
an
artel
than
with
workers
the
last
attempts
of
the
ministry
of
war
to
deal
directly
with
productive
artels
formed
ad
hoc
in
the
domestic
trades
and
to
give
them
orders
for
boots
and
all
sorts
of
brass
and
iron
goods
are
described
as
most
satisfactory
while
the
renting
of
a
crown
iron
work
votkinsk
to
an
artel
of
workers
which
took
place
seven
or
eight
years
ago
has
been
a
decided
success
we
can
thus
see
in
russia
how
the
old
medieval
institution
having
not
been
interfered
with
by
the
state
in
its
informal
manifestations
has
fully
survived
until
now
and
takes
the
greatest
variety
of
forms
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
modern
industry
and
commerce
as
to
the
balkan
peninsula
the
turkish
empire
and
caucasia
the
old
guilds
are
maintained
there
in
full
the
esnafs
of
servia
have
fully
preserved
their
medieval
character
they
include
both
masters
and
journeymen
regulate
the
trades
and
are
institutions
for
mutual
support
in
labour
and
sickness
while
the
amkari
of
caucasia
and
especially
at
tiflis
add
to
these
functions
a
considerable
influence
in
municipal
life
in
connection
with
i
ought
perhaps
to
mention
also
the
friendly
societies
the
unities
of
oddfellows
the
village
and
town
clubs
organized
for
meeting
the
doctors
bills
the
dress
and
burial
clubs
the
small
clubs
very
common
among
factory
girls
to
which
they
contribute
a
few
pence
every
week
and
afterwards
draw
by
lot
the
sum
of
one
pound
which
can
at
least
be
used
for
some
substantial
purchase
and
many
others
a
not
inconsiderable
amount
of
sociable
or
jovial
spirit
is
alive
in
all
such
societies
and
clubs
even
though
the
credit
and
debit
of
each
member
are
closely
watched
over
but
there
are
so
many
associations
based
on
the
readiness
to
sacrifice
time
health
and
life
if
required
that
we
can
produce
numbers
of
illustrations
of
the
best
forms
of
mutual
support
the
lifeboat
association
in
this
country
and
similar
institutions
on
the
continent
must
be
mentioned
in
the
first
place
the
former
has
now
over
three
hundred
boats
along
the
coasts
of
these
isles
and
it
would
have
twice
as
many
were
it
not
for
the
poverty
of
the
fisher
men
who
can
not
afford
to
buy
lifeboats
the
crews
consist
however
of
volunteers
whose
readiness
to
sacrifice
their
lives
for
the
rescue
of
absolute
strangers
to
them
is
put
every
year
to
a
severe
test
every
winter
the
loss
of
several
of
the
bravest
among
them
stands
on
record
and
if
we
ask
these
men
what
moves
them
to
risk
their
lives
even
when
there
is
no
reasonable
chance
of
success
their
answer
is
something
on
the
following
lines
a
fearful
snowstorm
blowing
across
the
channel
raged
on
the
flat
sandy
coast
of
a
tiny
village
in
kent
and
a
small
smack
laden
with
oranges
stranded
on
the
sands
near
by
in
these
shallow
waters
only
a
lifeboat
of
a
simplified
type
can
be
kept
and
to
launch
it
during
such
a
storm
was
to
face
an
almost
certain
disaster
and
yet
the
men
went
out
fought
for
hours
against
the
wind
and
the
boat
capsized
twice
one
man
was
drowned
the
others
were
cast
ashore
one
of
these
last
a
refined
coastguard
was
found
next
morning
badly
bruised
and
half
frozen
in
the
snow
i
asked
him
how
they
came
to
make
that
desperate
attempt
i
do
know
myself
was
his
reply
there
was
the
wreck
all
the
people
from
the
village
stood
on
the
beach
and
all
said
it
would
be
foolish
to
go
out
we
never
should
work
through
the
surf
we
saw
five
or
six
men
clinging
to
the
mast
making
desperate
signals
we
all
felt
that
something
must
be
done
but
what
could
we
do
one
hour
passed
two
hours
and
we
all
stood
there
we
all
felt
most
uncomfortable
then
all
of
a
sudden
through
the
storm
it
seemed
to
us
as
if
we
heard
their
cries
they
had
a
boy
with
them
we
could
not
stand
that
any
longer
all
at
once
we
said
we
must
go
the
women
said
so
too
they
would
have
treated
us
as
cowards
if
we
had
not
gone
although
next
day
they
said
we
had
been
fools
to
go
as
one
man
we
rushed
to
the
boat
and
went
the
boat
capsized
but
we
took
hold
of
it
the
worst
was
to
see
poor
drowning
by
the
side
of
the
boat
and
we
could
do
nothing
to
save
him
then
came
a
fearful
wave
the
boat
capsized
again
and
we
were
cast
ashore
the
men
were
still
rescued
by
the
boat
ours
was
caught
miles
away
i
was
found
next
morning
in
the
snow
the
same
feeling
moved
also
the
miners
of
the
rhonda
valley
when
they
worked
for
the
rescue
of
their
comrades
from
the
inundated
mine
they
had
pierced
through
yards
of
coal
in
order
to
reach
their
entombed
comrades
but
when
only
three
yards
more
remained
to
be
pierced
enveloped
them
the
lamps
went
out
and
the
retired
to
work
in
such
conditions
was
to
risk
being
blown
up
at
every
moment
but
the
raps
of
the
entombed
miners
were
still
heard
the
men
were
still
alive
and
appealed
for
help
and
several
miners
volunteered
to
work
at
any
risk
and
as
they
went
down
the
mine
their
wives
had
only
silent
tears
to
follow
them
not
one
word
to
stop
them
there
is
the
gist
of
human
psychology
unless
men
are
maddened
in
the
battlefield
they
can
not
stand
it
to
hear
appeals
for
help
and
not
to
respond
to
them
the
hero
goes
and
what
the
hero
does
all
feel
that
they
ought
to
have
done
as
well
the
sophisms
of
the
brain
can
not
resist
the
feeling
because
this
feeling
has
been
nurtured
by
thousands
of
years
of
human
social
life
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
of
life
in
societies
but
what
about
those
men
who
were
drowned
in
the
serpentine
in
the
presence
of
a
crowd
out
of
which
no
one
moved
for
their
rescue
it
may
be
asked
what
about
the
child
which
fell
into
the
regent
park
canal
also
in
the
presence
of
a
holiday
crowd
and
was
only
saved
through
the
presence
of
mind
of
a
maid
who
let
out
a
newfoundland
dog
to
the
rescue
the
answer
is
plain
enough
man
is
a
result
of
both
his
inherited
instincts
and
his
education
among
the
miners
and
the
seamen
their
common
occupations
and
their
contact
with
one
another
create
a
feeling
of
solidarity
while
the
surrounding
dangers
maintain
courage
and
pluck
in
the
cities
on
the
contrary
the
absence
of
common
interest
nurtures
indifference
while
courage
and
pluck
which
seldom
find
their
opportunities
disappear
or
take
another
direction
moreover
the
tradition
of
the
hero
of
the
mine
and
the
sea
lives
in
the
miners
and
fishermen
villages
adorned
with
a
poetical
halo
but
what
are
the
traditions
of
a
motley
london
crowd
the
only
tradition
they
might
have
in
common
ought
to
be
created
by
literature
but
a
literature
which
would
correspond
to
the
village
epics
hardly
exists
the
clergy
are
so
anxious
to
prove
that
all
that
comes
from
human
nature
is
sin
and
that
all
good
in
man
has
a
supernatural
origin
that
they
mostly
ignore
the
facts
which
can
not
be
produced
as
an
example
of
higher
inspiration
or
grace
coming
from
above
and
as
to
the
their
attention
is
chiefly
directed
towards
one
sort
of
heroism
the
heroism
which
promotes
the
idea
of
the
state
therefore
they
admire
the
roman
hero
or
the
soldier
in
the
battle
while
they
pass
by
the
fisherman
heroism
hardly
paying
attention
to
it
the
poet
and
the
painter
might
of
course
be
taken
by
the
beauty
of
the
human
heart
in
itself
but
both
seldom
know
the
life
of
the
poorer
classes
and
while
they
can
sing
or
paint
the
roman
or
the
military
hero
in
conventional
surroundings
they
can
neither
sing
nor
paint
impressively
the
hero
who
acts
in
those
modest
surroundings
which
they
ignore
if
they
venture
to
do
so
they
produce
a
mere
piece
of
rhetoric
the
countless
societies
clubs
and
alliances
for
the
enjoyment
of
life
for
study
and
research
for
education
and
so
on
which
have
lately
grown
up
in
such
numbers
that
it
would
require
many
years
to
simply
tabulate
them
are
another
manifestation
of
the
same
everworking
tendency
for
association
and
mutual
support
some
of
them
like
the
broods
of
young
birds
of
different
species
which
come
together
in
the
autumn
are
entirely
given
to
share
in
common
the
joys
of
life
every
village
in
this
country
in
switzerland
germany
and
so
on
has
its
cricket
football
tennis
pigeon
musical
or
singing
clubs
other
societies
are
much
more
numerous
and
some
of
them
like
the
cyclists
alliance
have
suddenly
taken
a
formidable
development
although
the
members
of
this
alliance
have
nothing
in
common
but
the
love
of
cycling
there
is
already
among
them
a
sort
of
freemasonry
for
mutual
help
especially
in
the
remote
nooks
and
corners
which
are
not
flooded
by
cyclists
they
look
upon
the
the
cyclists
alliance
club
in
a
village
as
a
sort
of
home
and
at
the
yearly
cyclists
camp
many
a
standing
friendship
has
been
established
the
kegelbruder
the
brothers
of
the
nine
pins
in
germany
are
a
similar
association
so
also
the
gymnasts
societies
members
in
germany
the
informal
brotherhood
of
paddlers
in
france
the
yacht
clubs
and
so
on
such
associations
certainly
do
not
alter
the
economical
stratification
of
society
but
especially
in
the
small
towns
they
contribute
to
smooth
social
distinctions
and
as
they
all
tend
to
join
in
large
national
and
international
federations
they
certainly
aid
the
growth
of
personal
friendly
intercourse
between
all
sorts
of
men
scattered
in
different
parts
of
the
globe
the
alpine
clubs
the
jagdschutzverein
in
germany
which
has
over
members
hunters
educated
foresters
zoologists
and
simple
lovers
of
nature
and
the
international
ornithological
society
which
includes
zoologists
breeders
and
simple
peasants
in
germany
have
the
same
character
not
only
have
they
done
in
a
few
years
a
large
amount
of
very
useful
work
which
large
associations
alone
could
do
properly
maps
refuge
huts
mountain
roads
studies
of
animal
life
of
noxious
insects
of
migrations
of
birds
and
so
on
but
they
create
new
bonds
between
men
two
alpinists
of
different
nationalities
who
meet
in
a
refuge
hut
in
the
caucasus
or
the
professor
and
the
peasant
ornithologist
who
stay
in
the
same
house
are
no
more
strangers
to
each
other
while
the
uncle
toby
society
at
newcastle
which
has
already
induced
over
boys
and
girls
never
to
destroy
birds
nests
and
to
be
kind
to
all
animals
has
certainly
done
more
for
the
development
of
human
feelings
and
of
taste
in
natural
science
than
lots
of
moralists
and
most
of
our
schools
we
can
not
omit
even
in
this
rapid
review
the
thousands
of
scientific
literary
artistic
and
educational
societies
up
till
now
the
scientific
bodies
closely
controlled
and
often
subsidized
by
the
state
have
generally
moved
in
a
very
narrow
circle
and
they
often
came
to
be
looked
upon
as
mere
openings
for
getting
state
appointments
while
the
very
narrowness
of
their
circles
undoubtedly
bred
petty
jealousies
still
it
is
a
fact
that
the
distinctions
of
birth
political
parties
and
creeds
are
smoothed
to
some
extent
by
such
associations
while
in
the
smaller
and
remote
towns
the
scientific
geographical
or
musical
societies
especially
those
of
them
which
appeal
to
a
larger
circle
of
amateurs
become
small
centres
of
intellectual
life
a
sort
of
link
between
the
little
spot
and
the
wide
world
and
a
place
where
men
of
very
different
conditions
meet
on
a
footing
of
equality
to
fully
appreciate
the
value
of
such
centres
one
ought
to
know
them
say
in
siberia
as
to
the
countless
educational
societies
which
only
now
begin
to
break
down
the
state
and
the
church
monopoly
in
education
they
are
sure
to
become
before
long
the
leading
power
in
that
branch
to
the
froebel
unions
we
already
owe
the
kindergarten
system
and
to
a
number
of
formal
and
informal
educational
associations
we
owe
the
high
standard
of
women
education
in
russia
although
all
the
time
these
societies
and
groups
had
to
act
in
strong
opposition
to
a
powerful
government
as
to
the
various
pedagogical
societies
in
germany
it
is
well
known
that
they
have
done
the
best
part
in
the
working
out
of
the
modern
methods
of
teaching
science
in
popular
schools
in
such
associations
the
teacher
finds
also
his
best
support
how
miserable
the
overworked
and
village
teacher
would
have
been
without
their
aid
all
these
associations
societies
brotherhoods
alliances
institutes
and
so
on
which
must
now
be
counted
by
the
ten
thousand
in
europe
alone
and
each
of
which
represents
an
immense
amount
of
voluntary
unambitious
and
unpaid
or
underpaid
work
what
are
they
but
so
many
manifestations
under
an
infinite
variety
of
aspects
of
the
same
tendency
of
man
towards
mutual
aid
and
support
for
nearly
three
centuries
men
were
prevented
from
joining
hands
even
for
literary
artistic
and
educational
purposes
societies
could
only
be
formed
under
the
protection
of
the
state
or
the
church
or
as
secret
brotherhoods
like
but
now
that
the
resistance
has
been
broken
they
swarm
in
all
directions
they
extend
over
all
multifarious
branches
of
human
activity
they
become
international
and
they
undoubtedly
contribute
to
an
extent
which
can
not
yet
be
fully
appreciated
to
break
down
the
screens
erected
by
states
between
different
nationalities
notwithstanding
the
jealousies
which
are
bred
by
commercial
competition
and
the
provocations
to
hatred
which
are
sounded
by
the
ghosts
of
a
decaying
past
there
is
a
conscience
of
international
solidarity
which
is
growing
both
among
the
leading
spirits
of
the
world
and
the
masses
of
the
workers
since
they
also
have
conquered
the
right
of
international
intercourse
and
in
the
preventing
of
a
european
war
during
the
last
quarter
of
a
century
this
spirit
has
undoubtedly
had
its
share
the
religious
charitable
associations
which
again
represent
a
whole
world
certainly
must
be
mentioned
in
this
place
there
is
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
the
great
bulk
of
their
members
are
moved
by
the
same
feelings
which
are
common
to
all
mankind
unhappily
the
religious
teachers
of
men
prefer
to
ascribe
to
such
feelings
a
supernatural
origin
many
of
them
pretend
that
man
does
not
consciously
obey
the
inspiration
so
long
as
he
has
not
been
enlightened
by
the
teachings
of
the
special
religion
which
they
represent
and
with
augustin
most
of
them
do
not
recognize
such
feelings
in
the
pagan
savage
moreover
while
early
christianity
like
all
other
religions
was
an
appeal
to
the
broadly
human
feelings
of
mutual
aid
and
sympathy
the
christian
church
has
aided
the
state
in
wrecking
all
standing
institutions
of
mutual
aid
and
support
which
were
anterior
to
it
or
developed
outside
of
it
and
instead
of
the
mutual
aid
which
every
savage
considers
as
due
to
his
kinsman
it
has
preached
charity
which
bears
a
character
of
inspiration
from
above
and
accordingly
implies
a
certain
superiority
of
the
giver
upon
the
receiver
with
this
limitation
and
without
any
intention
to
give
offence
to
those
who
consider
themselves
as
a
body
elect
when
they
accomplish
acts
simply
humane
we
certainly
may
consider
the
immense
numbers
of
religious
charitable
associations
as
an
outcome
of
the
same
tendency
all
these
facts
show
that
a
reckless
prosecution
of
personal
interests
with
no
regard
to
other
people
needs
is
not
the
only
characteristic
of
modern
life
by
the
side
of
this
current
which
so
proudly
claims
leadership
in
human
affairs
we
perceive
a
hard
struggle
sustained
by
both
the
rural
and
industrial
populations
in
order
to
reintroduce
standing
institutions
of
mutual
aid
and
support
and
we
discover
in
all
classes
of
society
a
movement
towards
the
establishment
of
an
infinite
variety
of
more
or
less
permanent
institutions
for
the
same
purpose
but
when
we
pass
from
public
life
to
the
private
life
of
the
modern
individual
we
discover
another
extremely
wide
world
of
mutual
aid
and
support
which
only
passes
unnoticed
by
most
sociologists
because
it
is
limited
to
the
narrow
circle
of
the
family
and
personal
friendship
under
the
present
social
system
all
bonds
of
union
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
same
street
or
neighbourhood
have
been
dissolved
in
the
richer
parts
of
the
large
towns
people
live
without
knowing
who
are
their
neighbours
but
in
the
crowded
lanes
people
know
each
other
perfectly
and
are
continually
brought
into
mutual
contact
of
course
petty
quarrels
go
their
course
in
the
lanes
as
elsewhere
but
groupings
in
accordance
with
personal
affinities
grow
up
and
within
their
circle
mutual
aid
is
practised
to
an
extent
of
which
the
richer
classes
have
no
idea
if
we
take
for
instance
the
children
of
a
poor
neighbourhood
who
play
in
a
street
or
a
churchyard
or
on
a
green
we
notice
at
once
that
a
close
union
exists
among
them
notwithstanding
the
temporary
fights
and
that
that
union
protects
them
from
all
sorts
of
misfortunes
as
soon
as
a
mite
bends
inquisitively
over
the
opening
of
a
drain
do
stop
there
another
mite
shouts
out
fever
sits
in
the
hole
do
climb
over
that
wall
the
train
will
kill
you
if
you
tumble
down
do
come
near
to
the
ditch
do
eat
those
berries
poison
you
will
die
such
are
the
first
teachings
imparted
to
the
urchin
when
he
joins
his
mates
how
many
of
the
children
whose
are
the
pavements
around
model
workers
dwellings
or
the
quays
and
bridges
of
the
canals
would
be
crushed
to
death
by
the
carts
or
drowned
in
the
muddy
waters
were
it
not
for
that
sort
of
mutual
support
and
when
a
fair
jack
has
made
a
slip
into
the
unprotected
ditch
at
the
back
of
the
milkman
yard
or
a
lizzie
has
after
all
tumbled
down
into
the
canal
the
young
brood
raises
such
cries
that
all
the
neighbourhood
is
on
the
alert
and
rushes
to
the
rescue
then
comes
in
the
alliance
of
the
mothers
you
could
not
imagine
a
who
lives
in
a
poor
neighbourhood
told
me
lately
how
much
they
help
each
other
if
a
woman
has
prepared
nothing
or
could
prepare
nothing
for
the
baby
which
she
expected
and
how
often
that
happens
all
the
neighbours
bring
something
for
the
one
of
the
neighbours
always
takes
care
of
the
children
and
some
other
always
drops
in
to
take
care
of
the
household
so
long
as
the
mother
is
in
bed
this
habit
is
general
it
is
mentioned
by
all
those
who
have
lived
among
the
poor
in
a
thousand
small
ways
the
mothers
support
each
other
and
bestow
their
care
upon
children
that
are
not
their
own
some
training
good
or
bad
let
them
decide
it
for
themselves
is
required
in
a
lady
of
the
richer
classes
to
render
her
able
to
pass
by
a
shivering
and
hungry
child
in
the
street
without
noticing
it
but
the
mothers
of
the
poorer
classes
have
not
that
training
they
can
not
stand
the
sight
of
a
hungry
child
they
must
feed
it
and
so
they
do
when
the
school
children
beg
bread
they
seldom
or
rather
never
meet
with
a
refusal
a
who
has
worked
several
years
in
whitechapel
in
connection
with
a
workers
club
writes
to
me
but
i
may
perhaps
as
well
transcribe
a
few
more
passages
from
her
letter
nursing
neighbours
in
cases
of
illness
without
any
shade
of
remuneration
is
quite
general
among
the
workers
also
when
a
woman
has
little
children
and
goes
out
for
work
another
mother
always
takes
care
of
them
if
in
the
working
classes
they
would
not
help
each
other
they
could
not
exist
i
know
families
which
continually
help
each
other
with
money
with
food
with
fuel
for
bringing
up
the
little
children
in
cases
of
illness
in
cases
of
death
mine
and
is
much
less
sharply
observed
among
the
poor
than
among
the
rich
shoes
dress
hats
and
so
on
what
may
be
wanted
on
the
spot
are
continually
borrowed
from
each
other
also
all
sorts
of
household
things
last
winter
the
members
of
the
united
radical
club
had
brought
together
some
little
money
and
began
after
christmas
to
distribute
free
soup
and
bread
to
the
children
going
to
school
gradually
they
had
children
to
attend
to
the
money
came
from
outsiders
but
all
the
work
was
done
by
the
members
of
the
club
some
of
them
who
were
out
of
work
came
at
four
in
the
morning
to
wash
and
to
peel
the
vegetables
five
women
came
at
nine
or
ten
after
having
done
their
own
household
work
for
cooking
and
stayed
till
six
or
seven
to
wash
the
dishes
and
at
meal
time
between
twelve
and
one
twenty
to
thirty
workers
came
in
to
aid
in
serving
the
soup
each
one
staying
what
he
could
spare
of
his
meal
time
this
lasted
for
two
months
no
one
was
paid
my
friend
also
mentions
various
individual
cases
of
which
the
following
are
typical
annie
was
given
by
her
mother
to
be
boarded
by
an
old
person
in
wilmot
street
when
her
mother
died
the
old
woman
who
herself
was
very
poor
kept
the
child
without
being
paid
a
penny
for
that
when
the
old
lady
died
too
the
child
who
was
five
years
old
was
of
course
neglected
during
her
illness
and
was
ragged
but
she
was
taken
at
once
by
the
wife
of
a
shoemaker
who
herself
has
six
children
lately
when
the
husband
was
ill
they
had
not
much
to
eat
all
of
them
the
other
day
mother
of
six
children
attended
m
g
throughout
her
illness
and
took
to
her
own
rooms
the
elder
child
but
do
you
need
such
facts
they
are
quite
general
i
know
also
oval
hackney
road
who
has
a
sewing
machine
and
continually
sews
for
others
without
ever
accepting
any
remuneration
although
she
has
herself
five
children
and
her
husband
to
look
after
and
so
on
for
every
one
who
has
any
idea
of
the
life
of
the
labouring
classes
it
is
evident
that
without
mutual
aid
being
practised
among
them
on
a
large
scale
they
never
could
pull
through
all
their
difficulties
it
is
only
by
chance
that
a
worker
family
can
live
its
lifetime
without
having
to
face
such
circumstances
as
the
crisis
described
by
the
ribbon
weaver
joseph
gutteridge
in
his
autobiography
and
if
all
do
not
go
to
the
ground
in
such
cases
they
owe
it
to
mutual
help
in
gutteridge
case
it
was
an
old
nurse
miserably
poor
herself
who
turned
up
at
the
moment
when
the
family
was
slipping
towards
a
final
catastrophe
and
brought
in
some
bread
coal
and
bedding
which
she
had
obtained
on
credit
in
other
cases
it
will
be
some
one
else
or
the
neighbours
will
take
steps
to
save
the
family
but
without
some
aid
from
other
poor
how
many
more
would
be
brought
every
year
to
irreparable
ruin
plimsoll
after
he
had
lived
for
some
time
among
the
poor
on
a
week
was
compelled
to
recognize
that
the
kindly
feelings
he
took
with
him
when
he
began
this
life
changed
into
hearty
respect
and
admiration
when
he
saw
how
the
relations
between
the
poor
are
permeated
with
mutual
aid
and
support
and
learned
the
simple
ways
in
which
that
support
is
given
after
a
many
years
experience
his
conclusion
was
that
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
such
as
these
men
were
so
were
the
vast
majority
of
the
working
classes
as
to
bringing
up
orphans
even
by
the
poorest
families
it
is
so
a
habit
that
it
may
be
described
as
a
general
rule
thus
among
the
miners
it
was
found
after
the
two
explosions
at
warren
vale
and
at
lund
hill
that
nearly
of
the
men
killed
as
the
respective
committees
can
testify
were
thus
supporting
relations
other
than
wife
and
child
have
you
reflected
plimsoll
added
what
this
is
rich
men
even
men
do
this
i
do
doubt
but
consider
the
difference
consider
what
a
sum
of
one
shilling
subscribed
by
each
worker
to
help
a
comrade
widow
or
to
help
a
to
defray
the
extra
expense
of
a
funeral
means
for
one
who
earns
a
week
and
has
a
wife
and
in
some
cases
five
or
six
children
to
support
but
such
subscriptions
are
a
general
practice
among
the
workers
all
over
the
world
even
in
much
more
ordinary
cases
than
a
death
in
the
family
while
aid
in
work
is
the
commonest
thing
in
their
lives
nor
do
the
same
practices
of
mutual
aid
and
support
fail
among
the
richer
classes
of
course
when
one
thinks
of
the
harshness
which
is
often
shown
by
the
richer
employers
towards
their
employees
one
feels
inclined
to
take
the
most
pessimist
view
of
human
nature
many
must
remember
the
indignation
which
was
aroused
during
the
great
yorkshire
strike
of
when
old
miners
who
had
picked
coal
from
an
abandoned
pit
were
prosecuted
by
the
colliery
owners
and
even
if
we
leave
aside
the
horrors
of
the
periods
of
struggle
and
social
war
such
as
the
extermination
of
thousands
of
workers
prisoners
after
the
fall
of
the
paris
commune
who
can
read
for
instance
revelations
of
the
labour
inquest
which
was
made
here
in
the
forties
or
what
lord
shaftesbury
wrote
about
the
frightful
waste
of
human
life
in
the
factories
to
which
the
children
taken
from
the
workhouses
or
simply
purchased
all
over
this
country
to
be
sold
as
factory
slaves
were
consigned
who
can
read
that
without
being
vividly
impressed
by
the
baseness
which
is
possible
in
man
when
his
greediness
is
at
stake
but
it
must
also
be
said
that
all
fault
for
such
treatment
must
not
be
thrown
entirely
upon
the
criminality
of
human
nature
were
not
the
teachings
of
men
of
science
and
even
of
a
notable
portion
of
the
clergy
up
to
a
quite
recent
time
teachings
of
distrust
despite
and
almost
hatred
towards
the
poorer
classes
did
not
science
teach
that
since
serfdom
has
been
abolished
no
one
need
be
poor
unless
for
his
own
vices
and
how
few
in
the
church
had
the
courage
to
blame
the
while
the
great
numbers
taught
that
the
sufferings
of
the
poor
and
even
the
slavery
of
the
negroes
were
part
of
the
divine
plan
was
not
nonconformism
itself
largely
a
popular
protest
against
the
harsh
treatment
of
the
poor
at
the
hand
of
the
established
church
with
such
spiritual
leaders
the
feelings
of
the
richer
classes
necessarily
became
as
pimsoll
remarked
not
so
much
blunted
as
stratified
they
seldom
went
downwards
towards
the
poor
from
whom
the
are
separated
by
their
manner
of
life
and
whom
they
do
not
know
under
their
best
aspects
in
their
life
but
among
themselves
allowance
being
made
for
the
effects
of
the
passions
and
the
futile
expenses
imposed
by
wealth
itself
among
themselves
in
the
circle
of
family
and
friends
the
rich
practise
the
same
mutual
aid
and
support
as
the
poor
ihering
and
dargun
are
perfectly
right
in
saying
that
if
a
statistical
record
could
be
taken
of
all
the
money
which
passes
from
hand
to
hand
in
the
shape
of
friendly
loans
and
aid
the
sum
total
would
be
enormous
even
in
comparison
with
the
commercial
transactions
of
the
world
trade
and
if
we
could
add
to
it
as
we
certainly
ought
to
what
is
spent
in
hospitality
petty
mutual
services
the
management
of
other
affairs
gifts
and
charities
we
certainly
should
be
struck
by
the
importance
of
such
transfers
in
national
economy
even
in
the
world
which
is
ruled
by
commercial
egotism
the
current
expression
we
have
been
harshly
treated
by
that
firm
shows
that
there
is
also
the
friendly
treatment
as
opposed
to
the
harsh
the
legal
treatment
while
every
commercial
man
knows
how
many
firms
are
saved
every
year
from
failure
by
the
friendly
support
of
other
firms
as
to
the
charities
and
the
amounts
of
work
for
general
which
are
voluntarily
done
by
so
many
persons
as
well
as
by
workers
and
especially
by
professional
men
every
one
knows
the
part
which
is
played
by
these
two
categories
of
benevolence
in
modern
life
if
the
desire
of
acquiring
notoriety
political
power
or
social
distinction
often
spoils
the
true
character
of
that
sort
of
benevolence
there
is
no
doubt
possible
as
to
the
impulse
coming
in
the
majority
of
cases
from
the
same
feelings
men
who
have
acquired
wealth
very
often
do
not
find
in
it
the
expected
satisfaction
others
begin
to
feel
that
whatever
economists
may
say
about
wealth
being
the
reward
of
capacity
their
own
reward
is
exaggerated
the
conscience
of
human
solidarity
begins
to
tell
and
although
society
life
is
so
arranged
as
to
stifle
that
feeling
by
thousands
of
artful
means
it
often
gets
the
upper
hand
and
then
they
try
to
find
an
outcome
for
that
deeply
human
need
by
giving
their
fortune
or
their
forces
to
something
which
in
their
opinion
will
promote
general
welfare
in
short
neither
the
crushing
powers
of
the
centralized
state
nor
the
teachings
of
mutual
hatred
and
pitiless
struggle
which
came
adorned
with
the
attributes
of
science
from
obliging
philosophers
and
sociologists
could
weed
out
the
feeling
of
human
solidarity
deeply
lodged
in
men
understanding
and
heart
because
it
has
been
nurtured
by
all
our
preceding
evolution
what
was
the
outcome
of
evolution
since
its
earliest
stages
can
not
be
overpowered
by
one
of
the
aspects
of
that
same
evolution
and
the
need
of
mutual
aid
and
support
which
had
lately
taken
refuge
in
the
narrow
circle
of
the
family
or
the
slum
neighbours
in
the
village
or
the
secret
union
of
workers
itself
again
even
in
our
modern
society
and
claims
its
rights
to
be
as
it
always
has
been
the
chief
leader
towards
further
progress
such
are
the
conclusions
which
we
are
necessarily
brought
to
when
we
carefully
ponder
over
each
of
the
groups
of

escape
from
a
french
prison
is
extremely
difficult
nevertheless
a
prisoner
escaped
from
one
of
the
french
prisons
in
or
he
even
managed
to
conceal
himself
during
the
whole
day
although
the
alarm
was
given
and
the
peasants
in
the
neighbourhood
were
on
the
for
him
next
morning
found
him
concealed
in
a
ditch
close
by
a
small
village
perhaps
he
intended
to
steal
some
food
or
some
clothes
in
order
to
take
off
his
prison
uniform
as
he
was
lying
in
the
ditch
a
fire
broke
out
in
the
village
he
saw
a
woman
running
out
of
one
of
the
burning
houses
and
heard
her
desperate
appeals
to
rescue
a
child
in
the
upper
storey
of
the
burning
house
no
one
moved
to
do
so
then
the
escaped
prisoner
dashed
out
of
his
retreat
made
his
way
through
the
fire
and
with
a
scalded
face
and
burning
clothes
brought
the
child
safe
out
of
the
fire
and
handed
it
to
its
mother
of
course
he
was
arrested
on
the
spot
by
the
village
gendarme
who
now
made
his
appearance
he
was
taken
back
to
the
prison
the
fact
was
reported
in
all
french
papers
but
none
of
them
bestirred
itself
to
obtain
his
release
if
he
had
shielded
a
warder
from
a
comrade
blow
he
would
have
been
made
a
hero
of
but
his
act
was
simply
humane
it
did
not
promote
the
state
ideal
he
himself
did
not
attribute
it
to
a
sudden
inspiration
of
divine
grace
and
that
was
enough
to
let
the
man
fall
into
oblivion

or

very
instructive
when
the
great
german
writer
on
law
began
his
philosophical
work

purpose
in
law
he
intended
to
analyze
the
active
forces
which
call
forth
the
advance
of
society
and
maintain
it
and
to
thus
give
the
theory
of
the
sociable
man
he
analyzed
first
the
egotistic
forces
at
work
including
the
present
and
coercion
in
its
variety
of
political
and
social
laws
and
in
a
carefully
scheme
of
his
work
he
intended
to
give
the
last
paragraph
to
the
ethical
forces
the
sense
of
duty
and
mutual
love
which
contribute
to
the
same
aim
when
he
came
however
to
discuss
the
social
functions
of
these
two
factors
he
had
to
write
a
second
volume
twice
as
big
as
the

he
treated

of
the
personal

if

take
now
the
teachings
which
can
be

from
the
analysis
of

society

the
body

relative
to
the
importance
of
mutual
aid
in
the
evolution
of
the
animal
world
and
of
mankind
we
may
sum
up
our
inquiry
as
follows
in
the
animal
world
we
have
seen
that
the
vast
majority
of
species
live
in
societies
and
that
they
find
in
association
the
best
arms
for
the
struggle
for
life
understood
of
course
in
its
wide
darwinian
sense
not
as
a
struggle
for
the
sheer
means
of
existence
but
as
a
struggle
against
all
natural
conditions
unfavourable
to
the
species
the
animal
species
in
which
individual
struggle
has
been
reduced
to
its
narrowest
limits
and
the
practice
of
mutual
aid
has
attained
the
greatest
development
are
invariably
the
most
numerous
the
most
prosperous
and
the
most
open
to
further
progress
the
mutual
protection
which
is
obtained
in
this
case
the
possibility
of
attaining
old
age
and
of
accumulating
experience
the
higher
intellectual
development
and
the
further
growth
of
sociable
habits
secure
the
maintenance
of
the
species
its
extension
and
its
further
progressive
evolution
the
unsociable
species
on
the
contrary
are
doomed
to
decay
going
next
over
to
man
we
found
him
living
in
clans
and
tribes
at
the
very
dawn
of
the
stone
age
we
saw
a
wide
series
of
social
institutions
developed
already
in
the
lower
savage
stage
in
the
clan
and
the
tribe
and
we
found
that
the
earliest
tribal
customs
and
habits
gave
to
mankind
the
embryo
of
all
the
institutions
which
made
later
on
the
leading
aspects
of
further
progress
out
of
the
savage
tribe
grew
up
the
barbarian
village
community
and
a
new
still
wider
circle
of
social
customs
habits
and
institutions
numbers
of
which
are
still
alive
among
ourselves
was
developed
under
the
principles
of
common
possession
of
a
given
territory
and
common
defence
of
it
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
village
folkmote
and
in
the
federation
of
villages
belonging
or
supposed
to
belong
to
one
stem
and
when
new
requirements
induced
men
to
make
a
new
start
they
made
it
in
the
city
which
represented
a
double
network
of
territorial
units
village
communities
connected
with
guilds
these
latter
arising
out
of
the
common
prosecution
of
a
given
art
or
craft
or
for
mutual
support
and
defence
and
finally
in
the
last
two
chapters
facts
were
produced
to
show
that
although
the
growth
of
the
state
on
the
pattern
of
imperial
rome
had
put
a
violent
end
to
all
medieval
institutions
for
mutual
support
this
new
aspect
of
civilization
could
not
last
the
state
based
upon
loose
aggregations
of
individuals
and
undertaking
to
be
their
only
bond
of
union
did
not
answer
its
purpose
the
tendency
finally
broke
down
its
iron
rules
it
reappeared
and
reasserted
itself
in
an
infinity
of
associations
which
now
tend
to
embrace
all
aspects
of
life
and
to
take
possession
of
all
that
is
required
by
man
for
life
and
for
reproducing
the
waste
occasioned
by
life
it
will
probably
be
remarked
that
mutual
aid
even
though
it
may
represent
one
of
the
factors
of
evolution
covers
nevertheless
one
aspect
only
of
human
relations
that
by
the
side
of
this
current
powerful
though
it
may
be
there
is
and
always
has
been
the
other
current
the
of
the
individual
not
only
in
its
efforts
to
attain
personal
or
caste
superiority
economical
political
and
spiritual
but
also
in
its
much
more
important
although
less
evident
function
of
breaking
through
the
bonds
always
prone
to
become
crystallized
which
the
tribe
the
village
community
the
city
and
the
state
impose
upon
the
individual
in
other
words
there
is
the
of
the
individual
taken
as
a
progressive
element
it
is
evident
that
no
review
of
evolution
can
be
complete
unless
these
two
dominant
currents
are
analyzed
however
the
of
the
individual
or
of
groups
of
individuals
their
struggles
for
superiority
and
the
conflicts
which
resulted
therefrom
have
already
been
analyzed
described
and
glorified
from
time
immemorial
in
fact
up
to
the
present
time
this
current
alone
has
received
attention
from
the
epical
poet
the
annalist
the
historian
and
the
sociologist
history
such
as
it
has
hitherto
been
written
is
almost
entirely
a
description
of
the
ways
and
means
by
which
theocracy
military
power
autocracy
and
later
on
the
richer
classes
rule
have
been
promoted
established
and
maintained
the
struggles
between
these
forces
make
in
fact
the
substance
of
history
we
may
thus
take
the
knowledge
of
the
individual
factor
in
human
history
as
granted
even
though
there
is
full
room
for
a
new
study
of
the
subject
on
the
lines
just
alluded
to
while
on
the
other
side
the
factor
has
been
hitherto
totally
lost
sight
of
it
was
simply
denied
or
even
scoffed
at
by
the
writers
of
the
present
and
past
generation
it
was
therefore
necessary
to
show
first
of
all
the
immense
part
which
this
factor
plays
in
the
evolution
of
both
the
animal
world
and
human
societies
only
after
this
has
been
fully
recognized
will
it
be
possible
to
proceed
to
a
comparison
between
the
two
factors
to
make
even
a
rough
estimate
of
their
relative
importance
by
any
method
more
or
less
statistical
is
evidently
impossible
one
single
war
we
all
know
may
be
productive
of
more
evil
immediate
and
subsequent
than
hundreds
of
years
of
the
unchecked
action
of
the
principle
may
be
productive
of
good
but
when
we
see
that
in
the
animal
world
progressive
development
and
mutual
aid
go
hand
in
hand
while
the
inner
struggle
within
the
species
is
concomitant
with
retrogressive
development
when
we
notice
that
with
man
even
success
in
struggle
and
war
is
proportionate
to
the
development
of
mutual
aid
in
each
of
the
two
conflicting
nations
cities
parties
or
tribes
and
that
in
the
process
of
evolution
war
itself
so
far
as
it
can
go
this
way
has
been
made
subservient
to
the
ends
of
progress
in
mutual
aid
within
the
nation
the
city
or
the
clan
we
already
obtain
a
perception
of
the
dominating
influence
of
the
factor
as
an
element
of
progress
but
we
see
also
that
the
practice
of
mutual
aid
and
its
successive
developments
have
created
the
very
conditions
of
society
life
in
which
man
was
enabled
to
develop
his
arts
knowledge
and
intelligence
and
that
the
periods
when
institutions
based
on
the
tendency
took
their
greatest
development
were
also
the
periods
of
the
greatest
progress
in
arts
industry
and
science
in
fact
the
study
of
the
inner
life
of
the
medieval
city
and
of
the
ancient
greek
cities
reveals
the
fact
that
the
combination
of
mutual
aid
as
it
was
practised
within
the
guild
and
the
greek
clan
with
a
large
initiative
which
was
left
to
the
individual
and
the
group
by
means
of
the
federative
principle
gave
to
mankind
the
two
greatest
periods
of
its
history
the
ancient
greek
city
and
the
medieval
city
periods
while
the
ruin
of
the
above
institutions
during
the
state
periods
of
history
which
followed
corresponded
in
both
cases
to
a
rapid
decay
as
to
the
sudden
industrial
progress
which
has
been
achieved
during
our
own
century
and
which
is
usually
ascribed
to
the
triumph
of
individualism
and
competition
it
certainly
has
a
much
deeper
origin
than
that
once
the
great
discoveries
of
the
fifteenth
century
were
made
especially
that
of
the
pressure
of
the
atmosphere
supported
by
a
series
of
advances
in
natural
philosophy
and
they
were
made
under
the
medieval
city
organization
once
these
discoveries
were
made
the
invention
of
the
and
all
the
revolution
which
the
conquest
of
a
new
power
implied
had
necessarily
to
follow
if
the
medieval
cities
had
lived
to
bring
their
discoveries
to
that
point
the
ethical
consequences
of
the
revolution
effected
by
steam
might
have
been
different
but
the
same
revolution
in
technics
and
science
would
have
inevitably
taken
place
it
remains
indeed
an
open
question
whether
the
general
decay
of
industries
which
followed
the
ruin
of
the
free
cities
and
was
especially
noticeable
in
the
first
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
did
not
considerably
retard
the
appearance
of
the
as
well
as
the
consequent
revolution
in
arts
when
we
consider
the
astounding
rapidity
of
industrial
progress
from
the
twelfth
to
the
fifteenth
centuries
in
weaving
working
of
metals
architecture
and
navigation
and
ponder
over
the
scientific
discoveries
which
that
industrial
progress
led
to
at
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
we
must
ask
ourselves
whether
mankind
was
not
delayed
in
its
taking
full
advantage
of
these
conquests
when
a
general
depression
of
arts
and
industries
took
place
in
europe
after
the
decay
of
medieval
civilization
surely
it
was
not
the
disappearance
of
the
nor
the
ruin
of
large
cities
and
the
extinction
of
intercourse
between
them
which
could
favour
the
industrial
revolution
and
we
know
indeed
that
james
watt
spent
twenty
or
more
years
of
his
life
in
order
to
render
his
invention
serviceable
because
he
could
not
find
in
the
last
century
what
he
would
have
readily
found
in
medieval
florence
or
brugge
that
is
the
artisans
capable
of
realizing
his
devices
in
metal
and
of
giving
them
the
artistic
finish
and
precision
which
the
requires
to
attribute
therefore
the
industrial
progress
of
our
century
to
the
war
of
each
against
all
which
it
has
proclaimed
is
to
reason
like
the
man
who
knowing
not
the
causes
of
rain
attributes
it
to
the
victim
he
has
immolated
before
his
clay
idol
for
industrial
progress
as
for
each
other
conquest
over
nature
mutual
aid
and
close
intercourse
certainly
are
as
they
have
been
much
more
advantageous
than
mutual
struggle
however
it
is
especially
in
the
domain
of
ethics
that
the
dominating
importance
of
the
principle
appears
in
full
that
mutual
aid
is
the
real
foundation
of
our
ethical
conceptions
seems
evident
enough
but
whatever
the
opinions
as
to
the
first
origin
of
the
feeling
or
instinct
may
be
whether
a
biological
or
a
supernatural
cause
is
ascribed
to
it
we
must
trace
its
existence
as
far
back
as
to
the
lowest
stages
of
the
animal
world
and
from
these
stages
we
can
follow
its
uninterrupted
evolution
in
opposition
to
a
number
of
contrary
agencies
through
all
degrees
of
human
development
up
to
the
present
times
even
the
new
religions
which
were
born
from
time
to
time
always
at
epochs
when
the
principle
was
falling
into
decay
in
the
theocracies
and
despotic
states
of
the
east
or
at
the
decline
of
the
roman
empire
even
the
new
religions
have
only
reaffirmed
that
same
principle
they
found
their
first
supporters
among
the
humble
in
the
lowest
downtrodden
layers
of
society
where
the
principle
is
the
necessary
foundation
of
life
and
the
new
forms
of
union
which
were
introduced
in
the
earliest
buddhist
and
christian
communities
in
the
moravian
brotherhoods
and
so
on
took
the
character
of
a
return
to
the
best
aspects
of
mutual
aid
in
early
tribal
life
each
time
however
that
an
attempt
to
return
to
this
old
principle
was
made
its
fundamental
idea
itself
was
widened
from
the
clan
it
was
extended
to
the
stem
to
the
federation
of
stems
to
the
nation
and
finally
in
ideal
at
least
to
the
whole
of
mankind
it
was
also
refined
at
the
same
time
in
primitive
buddhism
in
primitive
christianity
in
the
writings
of
some
of
the
mussulman
teachers
in
the
early
movements
of
the
reform
and
especially
in
the
ethical
and
philosophical
movements
of
the
last
century
and
of
our
own
times
the
total
abandonment
of
the
idea
of
revenge
or
of
due
reward
of
good
for
good
and
evil
for
evil
is
affirmed
more
and
more
vigorously
the
higher
conception
of
no
revenge
for
wrongs
and
of
freely
giving
more
than
one
expects
to
receive
from
his
neighbours
is
proclaimed
as
being
the
real
principle
of
morality
a
principle
superior
to
mere
equivalence
equity
or
justice
and
more
conducive
to
happiness
and
man
is
appealed
to
to
be
guided
in
his
acts
not
merely
by
love
which
is
always
personal
or
at
the
best
tribal
but
by
the
perception
of
his
oneness
with
each
human
being
in
the
practice
of
mutual
aid
which
we
can
retrace
to
the
earliest
beginnings
of
evolution
we
thus
find
the
positive
and
undoubted
origin
of
our
ethical
conceptions
and
we
can
affirm
that
in
the
ethical
progress
of
man
mutual
support
not
mutual
struggle
has
had
the
leading
part
in
its
wide
extension
even
at
the
present
time
we
also
see
the
best
guarantee
of
a
still
loftier
evolution
of
our
race
