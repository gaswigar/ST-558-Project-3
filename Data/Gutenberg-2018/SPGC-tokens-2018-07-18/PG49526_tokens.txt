preface
my
chief
purpose
in
publishing
this
book
and
the
one
which
will
immediately
follow
the
rise
and
fall
of
nauvoo
is
to
place
in
the
hands
of
the
youth
of
the
saints
a
full
statement
of
the
persecutions
endured
by
the
early
members
of
the
church
in
this
last
dispensation
in
the
states
of
missouri
and
illinois
that
they
may
be
made
acquainted
with
the
sacrifices
which
their
fathers
have
made
for
the
word
of
god
and
the
testimony
of
jesus
christ
and
i
indulge
the
hope
that
by
becoming
acquainted
with
the
story
of
the
suffering
of
the
early
saints
the
faith
of
the
gospel
will
become
all
the
more
dear
to
the
hearts
of
their
immediate
posterity
and
all
the
youth
of
zion
for
many
generations
to
come
i
think
without
depreciating
at
all
any
other
narrative
of
these
events
in
our
church
literature
i
may
claim
that
the
story
of
the
missouri
persecutions
in
these
pages
is
told
more
thoroughly
than
in
any
other
of
our
present
publications
this
arises
from
the
fact
that
this
book
deals
with
but
a
brief
period
in
the
history
of
the
church
from
to
and
therefore
admits
of
such
a
consideration
of
details
as
could
not
possibly
be
given
to
that
period
in
any
general
history
of
the
church
this
detailed
treatment
of
the
subject
in
the
opinion
of
the
author
is
justified
because
of
the
very
important
events
which
the
treatise
covers
and
also
for
the
reason
that
it
is
a
period
of
our
history
which
has
been
very
much
misrepresented
upon
which
misrepresentations
false
accusations
are
made
against
the
church
and
its
leaders
to
this
day
those
who
have
thought
themselves
called
upon
to
oppose
if
not
to
persecute
the
church
in
later
years
frequently
attempt
to
justify
their
present
opposition
by
insinuating
that
the
church
was
driven
from
missouri
and
illinois
for
other
reasons
than
adherence
to
an
unpopular
religion
the
impression
is
sought
to
be
created
that
it
was
for
some
overt
acts
against
the
state
or
national
government
or
for
some
offense
against
the
spirit
of
american
institutions
or
because
the
church
leaders
were
determined
to
be
a
law
unto
themselves
in
disregard
of
the
rights
of
others
it
is
in
part
to
correct
these
false
statements
and
guard
our
youth
against
the
influence
of
such
calumnious
insinuations
that
i
tell
this
story
of
the
missouri
persecutions
not
that
the
history
in
these
pages
is
written
for
the
purpose
of
glozing
over
the
defects
in
the
character
of
the
early
members
of
the
church
or
to
claim
for
them
absolute
freedom
from
errors
in
judgment
or
actual
sinfulness
in
conduct
i
have
not
written
what
may
be
called
argumentative
history
only
so
far
as
a
statement
of
the
truth
may
be
considered
an
argument
after
these
pages
are
read
i
feel
sure
that
no
one
will
be
able
to
accuse
me
of
failing
to
point
out
the
errors
of
the
early
members
of
the
church
indeed
i
have
been
careful
to
call
attention
to
the
complaints
which
the
lord
made
against
their
conduct
the
reproofs
of
his
inspired
servants
and
the
repeated
warnings
sent
to
them
by
the
prophet
joseph
smith
concerning
the
results
of
their
conduct
if
there
was
not
a
speedy
repentance
in
appendices
will
be
found
accounts
of
these
same
persecutions
as
told
by
writers
of
missouri
history
i
quote
these
extracts
from
the
history
of
jackson
county
published
by
the
union
historical
company
of
kansas
city
missouri
the
history
of

the
history
of
caldwell
county
by
crosby
johnson
and
the
history
of

published
by
the
union
historical
company
while
these
alleged
histories
of
the
mormon
war
mormons
in
jackson
county
mormon
exodus
are
contemptible
for
their
distortion
of
facts
and
misrepresentations
the
reader
by
having
them
at
hand
will
at
least
have
both
sides
of
the
story
presented
to
him
and
will
be
able
by
the
means
of
comparison
thus
afforded
to
judge
where
the
truth
of
the
matter
lies
and
it
will
contribute
to
the
making
of
this
book
a
valuable
work
of
reference
to
the
student
of
church
history
one
other
thing
i
ought
to
say
in
justice
to
myself
both
in
reference
to
this
book
and
the
rise
and
fall
of
nauvoo
very
much
of
the
matter
contained
in
the
two
volumes
indeed
most
of
it
was
published
in
a
series
of
articles
some
fifteen
years
ago
in
contributor
under
the
respective
titles
now
used
since
that
time
very
extensive
quotations
have
been
made
from
those
articles
sometimes
with
but
often
without
acknowledgement
of
the
authorship
and
to
such
extent
has
this
been
the
case
that
i
feel
it
necessary
to
make
mention
of
it
that
i
myself
may
not
be
charged
with
using
the
matter
prepared
by
others
when
in
reality
i
am
but
using
my
own
having
called
attention
to
this
subject
i
feel
that
it
will
not
be
out
of
place
to
say
something
further
upon
it
the
fault
not
to
say
literary
crime
of
plagiarism
is
by
far
too
common
some
men
who
would
never
think
of
stealing
a
man
property
or
even
of
using
it
without
his
permission
sometimes
do
not
hesitate
in
public
speech
or
in
written
articles
or
books
to
take
all
sorts
of
liberties
with
another
writings
quoting
without
acknowledgement
not
only
sentences
and
paragraphs
but
whole
pages
and
often
page
after
page
and
thus
they
bedeck
themselves
not
with
old
odd
ends
stolen
out
of
holy
writ
but
in
borrowed
phrases
and
sentences
the
fruits
of
another
research
and
thought
and
genius
if
the
writer
from
whom
they
steal
possesses
any
it
is
true
that
plagiarism
is
not
a
crime
under
the
law
a
man
if
he
so
elects
may
steal
both
the
ideas
and
the
literary
construction
of
another
without
fear
of
fine
or
imprisonment
but
no
writer
or
speaker
worthy
of
respect
would
be
found
pilfering
the
thoughts
or
expressions
of
another
any
more
than
a
honest
man
would
be
found
with
stolen
goods
upon
his
back
gradually
there
is
being
built
up
in
the
church
a
very
considerable
and
stately
literature
historical
doctrinal
and
poetical
and
for
one
i
hope
to
see
it
first
of
all
of
a
character
that
will
be
in
harmony
with
the
great
dispensation
of
the

chapter
i
the
facts
in
which
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
had
its
origin
the
story
of
the
persecutions
endured
by
the
saints
in
missouri
one
of
the
sovereign
states
of
the
united
states
of
america
properly
begins
with
the
advent
of
a
mission
to
the
lamanites
a
at
independence
missouri
in
the
winter
of
but
in
order
that
those
not
acquainted
with
the
history
of
the
church
may
understand
how
there
came
to
be
a
mission
to
the
lamanites
in
and
how
there
came
to
be
a
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
to
be
persecuted
i
think
it
proper
to
state
briefly
those
facts
in
which
the
church
had
its
origin
footnote
a
american
indians
i
know
the
story
has
often
been
told
so
often
indeed
that
all
novelty
in
relation
to
it
has
long
since
passed
away
but
in
history
there
are
certain
foundation
facts
that
are
as
essential
to
the
right
understanding
of
some
particular
phase
of
history
as
the
employment
of
the
first
principles
of
the
science
of
mathematics
is
to
the
solution
of
some
particular
problem
in
algebra
and
the
historical
writer
is
as
much
bound
to
state
those
foundation
facts
as
the
mathematician
is
to
use
the
first
principles
of
his
science
in
the
solution
of
his
problem
in
the
present
instance
however
though
i
deem
it
necessary
to
tell
again
such
a
well
known
story
as
the
rise
of
the
church
i
shall
attempt
no
embellishment
of
it
nor
shall
i
deal
with
the
religious
condition
of
the
world
at
the
time
of
the
origin
of
the
church
with
any
view
to
establish
the
probability
of
the
story
nor
stop
to
call
attention
to
the
reasonableness
and
strength
of
it
nor
the
evidences
of
its
truth
or
necessity
although
the
temptation
to
do
this
is
always
strong
whenever
the
facts
of
that
story
are
passed
before
me
in
review
i
shall
content
myself
on
this
occasion
with
a
mere
statement
of
the
facts
such
as
an
annalist
might
make
without
any
further
consideration
of
them
whatsoever
and
this
because
such
a
statement
will
serve
my
present
purpose
joseph
smith
the
man
who
under
the
direction
of
god
was
the
founder
of
the
church
was
born
at
the
little
village
of
sharon
windsor
county
in
the
state
of
vermont
on
the
of
december
in
the
year
of
our
lord
when
he
was
ten
years
of
age
the
smith
family
moved
from
vermont
to
the
state
of
new
york
settling
in
palmyra
wayne
county
four
years
later
the
family
moved
a
few
miles
south
to
the
town
of
manchester
ontario
county
here
in
the
spring
of
a
great
religious
revival
agitated
the
community
and
joseph
smith
was
much
affected
by
it
in
the
course
of
this
religious
excitement
he
was
much
perplexed
over
the
discussion
and
strifes
of
the
different
christian
sects
and
often
wondered
how
it
was
that
the
church
of
christ
could
be
so
divided
into
contending
factions
i
found
he
said
some
years
later
when
writing
his
recollections
of
those
early
days
of
his
religious
experience
i
found
that
there
was
a
great
clash
in
religious
sentiment
if
i
went
to
one
society
they
referred
me
to
one
plan
and
another
to
another
each
one
pointing
to
his
own
particular
creed
as
the
of
perfection
considering
that
all
could
not
be
right
and
that
god
could
not
be
the
author
of
so
much
confusion
i
determined
to
investigate
the
subject
more
fully
believing
that
if
god
had
a
church
it
would
not
be
split
up
into
factions
and
that
if
he
taught
one
society
to
worship
one
way
and
administer
in
one
set
of
ordinances
he
would
not
teach
another
principles
which
were
diametrically
opposed

from
a
letter
to
john
wentworth
written
in
wentworth
at
the
time
was
the
editor
of
the
in
the
midst
of
these
perplexities
joseph
attention
was
called
to
the
first
chapter
of
the
epistle
of
james
where
it
is
written
if
any
of
you
lack
wisdom
let
him
ask
of
god
that
giveth
to
all
men
liberally
and
unbraideth
not
and
it
shall
be
given
him
this
instruction
the
youth
determined
to
follow
and
accordingly
repaired
to
a
secret
place
in
the
woods
near
his
father
house
where
he
called
upon
god
for
wisdom
while
so
engaged
he
was
seized
upon
by
some
power
of
darkness
which
threw
him
violently
to
the
ground
and
it
seemed
for
a
time
that
he
was
doomed
to
sudden
destruction
it
was
no
imaginary
power
but
some
actual
being
from
the
unseen
world
who
thus
seized
him
his
tongue
for
a
time
was
bound
that
he
could
not
speak
darkness
gathered
about
him
but
exerting
all
his
powers
he
called
upon
god
to
deliver
him
out
of
the
hands
of
his
enemy
and
at
the
very
moment
he
was
ready
to
give
up
in
despair
and
abandon
himself
to
destruction
he
beheld
a
pillar
of
light
immediately
over
his
head
descending
towards
him
its
brightness
was
above
that
of
the
sun
at
noonday
and
no
sooner
did
it
envelop
him
than
he
was
freed
from
the
enemy
who
had
held
him
in
his
power
when
the
light
rested
upon
him
he
beheld
within
it
two
personages
standing
above
him
in
the
air
whose
brightness
and
glory
defied
all
description
they
exactly
resembled
each
other
in
form
and
features
one
of
them
pointing
to
the
other
said
joseph
this
is
my
beloved
son
hear
him
as
soon
as
the
youth
gained
his
he
asked
the
personage
to
whom
he
was
thus
introduced
which
of
all
the
religious
sects
was
right
that
he
might
join
it
he
was
answered
that
none
of
the
sects
were
right
that
their
creeds
were
an
abomination
to
god
that
their
professors
were
corrupt
that
they
drew
near
to
god
with
their
lips
but
their
hearts
were
far
removed
from
him
that
they
taught
for
doctrine
the
commandments
of
men
that
they
had
a
form
of
godliness
but
denied
the
power
thereof
and
he
was
strictly
commanded
to
join
none
of
them
but
was
informed
that
at
some
future
time
the
fullness
of
the
gospel
would
be
made
known
to
him
c
footnote
c
letter
to
john
wentworth
i
can
not
refrain
at
this
point
from
calling
attention
at
least
in
a
foot
note
to
the
importance
of
this
great
vision
which
lies
at
the
very
foundation
of
what
the
world
calls
mormonism
at
a
glance
it
gives
the
reason
for
the
existence
of
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
and
also
the
reason
for
the
proclamation
of
the
new
dispensation
of
the
gospel
it
presents
to
the
world
it
makes
known
the
awful
fact
that
the
gospel
was
not
on
the
earth
at
that
time
that
none
of
the
churches
were
acknowledged
of
god
as
his
that
divine
authority
to
preach
and
administer
the
ordinances
of
salvation
was
not
among
men
therefore
if
men
were
to
have
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
it
must
be
restored
from
heaven
the
church
of
christ
must
be
again
established
divine
authority
must
be
renewed
moreover
this
splendid
vision
dispelled
the
vagaries
that
men
had
conjured
up
in
respect
to
the
person
of
deity
instead
of
being
a
personage
without
body
parts
or
passions
it
revealed
the
fact
that
he
had
both
body
and
parts
that
he
was
in
the
form
of
man
or
rather
that
man
had
been
made
in
his
image
the
vision
clearly
proves
that
the
father
and
son
are
distinct
persons
and
not
one
person
as
the
christian
world
believes
the
oneness
of
the
godhead
so
frequently
spoken
of
in
scripture
must
therefore
relate
to
oneness
of
sentiment
and
agreement
in
purpose
to
likeness
the
great
revelation
swept
away
the
rubbish
of
human
dogma
tradition
and
speculation
that
had
accumulated
in
all
the
ages
since
personal
ministry
on
earth
by
announcing
that
god
did
not
acknowledge
any
of
the
sects
of
christendom
as
his
church
nor
their
creeds
as
his
gospel
indeed
the
lord
himself
declared
that
they
taught
for
doctrine
the
commandments
of
men
thus
the
ground
was
cleared
for
the
planting
of
the
truth
the
vision
showed
how
mistaken
the
christian
world
was
in
claiming
that
all
revelation
had
ceased
that
god
would
no
more
reveal
himself
to
man
the
vision
created
a
witness
for
god
on
the
earth
a
man
lived
who
could
say
to
some
purpose
that
god
lived
and
that
jesus
was
the
christ
for
he
had
seen
and
talked
with
them
thus
was
laid
anew
the
foundation
for
faith
in
this
heavenly
visitation
joseph
smith
related
to
many
of
his
acquaintances
including
some
sectarian
ministers
who
generally
disbelieved
his
story
and
ridiculed
him
for
telling
it
all
said
inspired
dreams
and
revelations
from
god
were
no
more
to
be
expected
after
an
interval
of
three
years
joseph
smith
again
received
a
heavenly
visitant
on
the
of
september
after
having
retired
to
his
chamber
he
betook
himself
to
prayer
seeking
to
know
his
standing
before
the
lord
while
so
engaged
his
room
began
to
be
filled
with
beautiful
light
in
the
midst
of
which
he
beheld
a
personage
who
announced
himself
to
be
moroni
one
of
the
ancient
prophets
of
the
western
hemisphere
now
raised
from
the
dead
and
made
an
angel
of
god
he
said
he
was
sent
from
the
divine
presence
to
reveal
the
existence
of
an
ancient
record
engraven
upon
plates
of
gold
giving
an
account
of
the
origin
of
the
american
indians
of
god
with
their
forefathers
of
the
rise
and
fall
of
their
civilization
of
the
ministry
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
among
them
after
his
resurrection
from
the
dead
and
of
the
establishment
of
the
christian
religion
and
the
church
of
god
in
their
midst
joseph
smith
was
also
informed
that
this
record
was
concealed
in
a
hill
not
far
distant
and
that
with
it
would
be
found
a
urim
and
thummim

were
hidden

those
who
would

when
this
vision
was
passed
the
angel
quoted
a

of
ancient
prophecies
relating
to
the
gathering
of
israel
in
the
last
days
and
the
judgments
of
god
upon
the
wicked
all
of
which
he
declared

the
message
of

night

instructed
the

to
make
a
confidant
of
his
father
joseph
smith
and
make
known
to
him
the
visitations
he
had
received
and
the
things
revealed
which
the
youth
promptly
and
gladly
did
and
from
that
hour
received
consolation
and
encouragement
from
his
father
the
same
day
namely
of
september
joseph
smith
went
to
the
place
where
the
record
was
deposited
called
by
moroni
cumorah
and
there
in
a
rude
stone
box
the
crowning
cover
of
which
he
could
see
above
the
surface
of
the
hillside
he
found
the
record
together
with
the
urim
and
thummim
moroni
appeared
to
him
again
while
he
was
viewing
the
sacred
treasure
and
forbade
him
taking
the
plates
from
their
place
of
concealment
as
the
time
had
not
yet
come
for
him
to
take
possession
of
them
he
was
required
to
meet
the
angel
at
that
place
in
one
year
from
that
time
and
from
year
to
year
until
the
time
should
come
for
the
record
to
be
given
to
him
for
translation
these
annual
visits
at
cumorah
continued
until
the
of
september
when
the
plates
were
committed
to
his
keeping
with
instructions
to
translate
them
he
received
a
strict
commandment
to
show
them
to
no
man
except
such
as
god
would
appoint
to
see
them
and
bear
witness
of
their
existence
and
the
truth
of
what
they
contained
nor
was
he
to
have
any
other
object
in
view
in
obtaining
and
translating
the
record
than
the
glory
of
god
and
the
establishment
of
his
church
in
the
earth
with
the
assistance
of
a
man
of
the
name
of
martin
harris
and
another
of
the
name
of
oliver
cowdery
the
latter
acting
as

in
about
two
years

a

published
it
at

the

is
a
summary
of
this
interesting
record
as
given
by
the
prophet
in
his
letter
to
wentworth
in
this
important
and
interesting
book
the
history
of
ancient
america
is
unfolded
from
its
first
settlement
by
a
colony
that
came
from
the
tower
of
babel
at
the
confusion
of
languages
to
the
beginning
of
the
fifth
century
of
the
christian
era
we
are
informed
by
these
records
that
america
in
ancient
times
had
been
inhabited
by
two
distinct
races
of
people
the
first
was
called
jaredites
and
came
directly
from
the
tower
of
babel
the
second
race
came
directly
from
the
city
of
jerusalem
about
six
hundred
years
before
christ
they
were
principally
israelites
of
the
descendants
of
joseph
the
jaredites
were
destroyed
about
the
time
that
the
israelites
came
from
jerusalem
who
succeeded
them
in
the
inheritance
of
the
country
the
principal
nation
of
the
second
race
fell
in
battle
towards
the
close
of
the
fourth
century
the
remnant
are
the
indians
that
now
inhabit
this
country
this
book
also
tells
us
that
our
savior
made
his
appearance
upon
this
continent
after
his
resurrection
that
he
planted
the
gospel
here
in
all
its
fullness
and
richness
and
power
and
blessing
that
they
had
apostles
prophets
pastors
teachers
and
evangelists
the
same
order
the
same
priesthood
the
same
ordinances
gifts
powers
and
blessings
as
were
enjoyed
on
the
eastern
continent
that
the
people
were
cut
off
in
consequence
of
their
transgressions
that
the
last
of
their
prophets
who
existed
among
them
were
commanded
to
write
an
abridgment
of
their
prophecies
history
and
to
hide
it
up
in
the
earth
and
that
it
should
come
forth
and
be
united
with
the
bible
for
the
accomplishment
of
the
purposes
of
god
in
the
last
days
the
book
of
mormon
was
not
brought
forth
without
serious
opposition
the
commandment
not
to
show
the
plates
to
anyone
except
those
whom
god
should
appoint
to
be
witnesses
of
their
existence
and
their
truth
necessarily
enjoined
secrecy
upon
joseph
smith
and
involved
more
or
less
of
mystery
in
his
movements
and
yet
it
became
necessary
for
some
to
know
of
his
having
the
records
or
else
how
could
he
obtain
the
necessary
assistance
to
translate
them
these
prohibitions
upon
the
prophet
and
the
necessary
secrecy
they
involved
gave
rise
to
a
perfect
flood
of
misrepresentations
and
slanders
enemies
pursued
him
at
every
turn
the
vilest
calumnies
were
circulated
both
with
respect
to
himself
and
his
family
they
were
charged
with
the
grossest
ignorance
superstition
idleness
and
all
things
that
go
to
the
making
of
vicious
and
low
characters
and
yet
it
is
evident
from
the
testimony
of
those
who
personally
knew
them
that
the
smiths
while
poor
were
nevertheless
people
of
upright
lives
kind
neighbors
and
good
citizens
this
is
not
said
for
the
purpose
of
claiming
for
joseph
smith
exemption
from
many
boyish
follies
and
the
common
weaknesses
of
humanity
the
existence
of
these
weaknesses
in
fact
he
himself
freely
admits
and
deplores
and
as
much
has
been
made
of
his
own
admissions
on
that
head
i
think
it
proper
that
what
he
has
said
upon
the
subject
should
be
given
in
full
and
hence
i
republish
here
a
letter
of
his
to
oliver
cowdery
which
the
prophet
wrote
upon
hearing
that
cowdery
in
was
about
to
publish
a
series
of
letters
on
the
subject
of
early
scenes
in
the
church
following
is
the
letter
cowdery
dear
brother
having
learned
from
the
first
number
of
the
and
advocate
that
you
were
not
only
about
to
give
a
history
of
the
rise
and
progress
of
the
church
of
the
saints
but
that
said
history
would
necessarily
embrace
my
life
and
character
i
have
been
induced
to
give
you
the
time
and
place
of
my
birth
as
i
have
learned
that
many
of
the
opposers
of
those
principles
which
i
have
held
forth
to
the
world
profess
a
personal
acquaintance
with
me
though
when
in
my
presence
represent
me
to
be
another
person
in
age
education
and
stature
from
what
i
am
i
was
born
according
to
the
record
of
the
same
kept
by
my
parents
in
the
town
of
sharon
windsor
county
vermont
on
the
of
december
at
the
age
of
ten
my
father
family
removed
to
palmyra
new
york
where
and
in
the
vicinity
of
which
i
lived
or
made
it
my
place
of
residence
until
i
was
the
latter
part
in
the
town
of
manchester
during
this
time
as
is
common
to
most
or
all
youths
i
fell
into
many
vices
and
follies
but
as
my
accusers
are
and
have
been
forward
to
accuse
me
of
being
guilty
of
gross
and
outrageous
violations
of
the
peace
and
good
order
of
the
community
i
take
the
occasion
to
remark
that
though
as
i
have
said
above
as
is
common
to
most
or
all
youths
i
fell
into
many
vices
and
follies
i
have
not
neither
can
it
be
sustained
in
truth
been
guilty
of
wronging
or
injuring
any
man
or
society
of
men
and
those
imperfections
to
which
i
allude
and
for
which
i
have
often
had
occasion
to
lament
were
a
light
and
too
often
vain
mind
exhibiting
a
foolish
and
trifling
conversation
this
being
all
and
the
worst
that
my
accusers
can
substantiate
against
my
moral
character
i
wish
to
add
that
it
is
not
without
a
deep
feeling
of
regret
that
i
am
thus
called
upon
in
answer
to
my
own
conscience
to
fulfill
a
duty
i
owe
to
myself
as
well
as
to
the
cause
of
truth
in
making
this
public
confession
of
my
former
uncircumspect
walk
and
trifling
conversation
and
more
particularly
as
i
often
acted
in
violation
of
those
holy
precepts
which
i
knew
came
from
god
but
as
the
articles
and
covenants
of
this
church
are
plain
upon
this
particular
point
i
do
not
deem
it
important
to
proceed
further
i
only
add
that
i
do
not
nor
never
have
pretended
to
be
any
other
than
a
man
subject
to
passion
and
liable
without
the
assisting
grace
of
the
savior
to
deviate
from
that
perfect
path
in
which
all
men
are
commanded
to
walk
by
giving
the
above
a
place
in
your
valuable
paper
you
will
confer
a
lasting
favor
upon
myself
as
an
individual
and
as
i
humbly
hope
subserve
the
cause
of
righteousness
i
am
with
feelings
of
esteem
your
in
the
gospel
of
our
lord
joseph
smith
it
is
clear
from
this
letter
that
joseph
smith
while
acknowledging
his
imperfections
does
not
accuse
himself
of
any
dark
crimes
of
a
nature
to
disqualify
him
for
his
subsequently
exalted
station
or
the
great
work
to
which
he
was
called
he
goes
no
further
than
to
confess
to
lightness
and
vanity
of
mind
resulting
in
a
foolish
and
trifling
conversation
but
even
that
on
account
of
his
quick
conscience
and
innocent
life
occasioned
him
much
remorse
while
the
book
of
mormon
was
in
process
of
translation
namely
in
may
the
question
of
baptism
came
up
between
joseph
smith
and
oliver
cowdery
they
repaired
to
the
woods
to
inquire
of
the
lord
concerning
it
when
an
angel
from
heaven
appeared
to
them
and
announced
himself
to
be
john
the
baptist
of
the
new
testament
now
raised
from
the
dead
and
sent
to
them
by
the
apostles
peter
james
and
john
under
whose
direction
he
acted
to
confer
upon
them
the
aaronic
priesthood
h
he
placed
his
hands
upon
their
heads
and
said
footnote
h
elsewhere
the
writer
has
said
concerning
this
event
when
the
work
reached
that
stage
of
development
that
men
could
be
taught
repentance
and
receive
baptism
for
the
remission
of
sins
who
so
qualified
or
who
with
more
propriety
could
be
sent
to
deliver
the
keys
of
the
priesthood
that
is
especially
appointed
to
cry
repentance
and
administer
baptism
than
teacher
of
repentance
and
baptist
witness
for
god
upon
you
my
fellow
servants
in
the
name
of
messiah
i
confer
the
priesthood
of
aaron
which
holds
the
keys
of
the
ministration
of
angels
and
of
the
gospel
of
repentance
and
of
baptism
for
the
remission
of
sins
and
this
shall
never
be
taken
from
the
earth
until
the
sons
of
levi
do
offer
again
an
offering
unto
the
lord
in
righteousness
they
were
then
commanded
to
each
baptize
the
other
which
they
did
and
thus
baptism
for
the
remission
of
sins
under
divine
authority
was
again
commenced
on
earth
this
ordination
received
under
the
hands
of
the
angel
gave
them
the
right
and
power
to
preach
the
gospel
call
men
to
repentance
and
baptize
them
for
a
remission
of
their
sins
this
they
began
to
do
and
in
a
short
time
quite
a
number
had
been
baptized
soon
after
this
first
ordination
namely
some
time
in
the
month
of

and

were
again
visited
by
angels
the
ancient
apostles
peter
james
and
john
came
to
them
on
the
banks
of
the
susquehanna
river
between
harmony
susquehanna

and
colesville
broome
county
and
conferred
upon
them
the
holy
apostleship
the
keys
of
the
higher
or
melchisedek
priesthood
which
gave
them
power
not
only
to
preach
the
gospel
and
administer
baptism
but
to
lay
on
hands
for
the
holy
ghost
together
with
right
to
all
the
offices
in
the
church
this
priesthood
gave
them
power
to
organize
the
church
set
in
order
the
affairs
thereof
in
all
the
world
and
preside
over
it
as
god
representatives
the
authority
of
god
thus
restored
to
earth
the
way
was
prepared
for
the
organization
of
the
church
still
the
young
men
to
whom
had
been
entrusted
these
great
powers
waited
further
direction
from
the
lord
and
did
not
proceed
with
so
great
an
undertaking
until
he
commanded
them
at
length
the
commandment
came
and
the
day
of
april
was
appointed
as
the
day
on
which
to
effect
the
organization
of
the
church
a
number
of
the
people
who
had
been
baptized
met
with
joseph
smith
and
oliver
cowdery
on
the
day
appointed
at
the
house
of
peter
whitmer
in
fayette
seneca
county
new
york
to
effect
that
organization
the
meeting
was
opened
by
solemn
prayer
after
which
according
to
previous
instructions
from
the
lord
the
prophet
joseph
called
upon
the
brethren
present
to
know
if
they
would
accept
himself
and
oliver
cowdery
as
their
teachers
in
religion
and
if
they
were
willing
that
they
should
proceed
to
organize
the
church
according
to
the
commandment
of
the
lord
to
this
the
converts
to
the
faith
consented
by
unanimous
vote
joseph
then
ordained
oliver
an
elder
of
the
church
of
jesus
christ
after
which
oliver
ordained
joseph
an
elder
of
said
church
the
sacrament
was
administered
and
those
who
had
been
previously
baptized
were
confirmed
members
of
the
church
and
received
the
holy
ghost
by
the
laying
on
of
hands
some
enjoyed
the
gift
of
prophecy
and
all
rejoiced
exceedingly
while
the
church
was
yet
assembled
a
revelation
was
received
from
the
lord
directing
that
a
record
be
kept
and
that
in
it
joseph
smith
be
called
a
seer
a
translator
a
prophet
and
an
apostle
of
jesus
christ
an
elder
of
the
church
and
the
church
was
commanded
to
give
heed
to
all
his
words
and
commandments
which
he
should
receive
from
the
lord
accepting
his
word
as
the
word
of
god
in
all
patience
and
faith
on
condition
of
their
doing
this
the
lord
promised
them
that
the
gates
of
hell
should
not
prevail
against
the
church
but
on
the
contrary
he
would
disperse
the
powers
of
darkness
before
them
and
shake
the
very
heavens
for
their
good
in
addition
to
the
ordination
of
joseph
and
oliver
to
be
elders
in
the
church
as
stated
above
other
brethren
were
called
and
ordained
to
different
offices
in
the
priesthood
as
the
spirit
directed
and
after
a
happy
time
says
the
prophet
spent
in
witnessing
and
feeling
for
ourselves
the
power
and
blessings
of
the
holy
ghost
through
the
grace
of
god
bestowed
upon
us
we
dismissed
with
the
pleasing
knowledge
that
we
were
now
individually
members
of
and
acknowledged
of
god
the
church
of
jesus
christ
organized
in
accordance
with
commandments
and
revelations
given
by
him
to
ourselves
in
the
last
days
as
well
as
according
to
the
order
of
the
church
as
recorded
in
the
new
testament
on
sunday
the
of
april
the
public
ministry
of
the
church
may
be
said
to
have
begun
oliver
cowdery
on
that
day
preached
the
first
public
discourse
of
the
new
dispensation
then
opening
of
the
nature
of
the
discourse
we
know
little
or
nothing
the
meeting
was
held
by
previous
appointment
at
the
house
of
peter
whitmer
in
fayette
and
was
largely
attended
by
people
of
the
neighborhood
and
the
preaching
was
certainly
successful
as
upon
the
same
day
and
doubtless
as
a
result
of
the
explanations
teachings
doctrines
and
spirit
of
the
discourse
a
number
came
forward
for
baptism
and
a
few
days
later
a
number
more
thirteen
in
all
and
so
the
work
grew
and
prospered
fayette
in
seneca
county
new
york
and
colesville
broome
county
in
the
same
state
were
the
centers
of
activity
for
the
church
in
those
early
days
in
both
places
meetings
were
occasionally
held
and
baptisms
were
frequent
in
the
clear
beautiful
waters
of
seneca
lake
what
historical
associations
will
yet
gather
about
these
localities
fayette
seneca
lake
i
venture
to
predict
that
these
places
will
in
the
ages
to
come
be
as
famous
as
capernaum
and
lake
gennesaret
the
latter
were
the
scenes
of
christ
early
ministry
the
former
the
scenes
of
joseph
smiths
the
latter
were
identified
with
the
dispensation
of
the
meridian
of
time
the
former
with
the
dispensation
of
the
fullness
of
times
capernaum
and
gennesaret
are
associated
with
memories
of
the
christ
with
simon
peter
with
john
with
andrew
and
nathaniel
and
mary
of
magdala
fayette
and
seneca
with
joseph
smith
with
oliver
with
david
whitmer
with
joseph
knight
and
newel
his
son
with
emily
coburn
and
others
gennesaret
was
but
the
widening
of
the
jordan
seneca
but
one
of
the
river
valleys
once
occupied
and
modified
by
the
glaciers
which
in
ancient
times
filled
that
land
i
the
site
of
the
ancient
capernaum
is
now
unknown
so
too
the
fayette
of
our
church
history
is
no
more
but
of
the
latter
as
of
the
former
and
of
seneca
as
of
gennesaret
it
may
be
said
if
every
vestige
of
human
habitation
should
disappear
from
beside
it
and
the
jackal
and
the
hyena
should
howl
about
the
shattered
fragments
where
joseph
once
taught
yet
the
fact
that
he
chose
it
as
the
scene
of
his
ministry
will
give
a
sense
of
sacredness
and
pathos
to
its
lovely
waters
till
time
shall
be
no
more

the

the
coming
forth
of
which
has
already
been

contains
many
promises
to
the
lamanites
that
is
to
the
american
indians
whom
it
reveals
to
be
the
remnants
of
mighty
nations
that
once
inhabited
the
americas
and
also
proclaims
them
to
be
descendants
of
the
house
of
israel
their
present
fallen
state
arises
from
their
departure
from
the
ways
of
the
lord
and
the
instructions
and
doctrines
of
their
ancient
prophets
the
very
blackness
of
their
skin
is
the
result
of
god
curse
upon
them
for
their
unrighteousness
yet
are
they
promised
that
they
shall
know
their
origin
the
favored
race
from
which
they
are
descended
it
is
promised
that
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
shall
be
declared
among
them
and
they
shall
regard
it
as
a
blessing
from
the
hand
of
the
lord
and
their
scales
of
darkness
shall
begin
to
fall
from
their
eyes
and
many
generations
shall
not
pass
away
among
them
save
they
shall
be
a
white
and

people

is
promised
that
zion
the

jerusalem
shall
be
built
upon
the
land
of
their

which
according

is
a
land
especially
dedicated
to
the
seed
of

very
naturally
of
course
those
who
accepted
the
book
of
mormon
as
true
possessed
a
lively
interest
in
this
people
that
is
in
the
lamanites
and
anxiously
looked
forward
to
the
commencement
of
the
fulfillment
of
the
words
of
their
ancient
prophets
concerning
them
and
hence
at
the
close
of
a
conference
held
in
the
last
days
of
september
and
which
also
extended
into
the
early
days
of
october
a
great
desire
says
the
prophet
was
manifested
by
several
elders
respecting
the
remnants
of
the
house
of
joseph
the
lamanites
residing
in
the
west
knowing
that
the
purposes
of
the
lord
were
great
to
that
people
and
hoping
that
the
time
had
come
when
the
promises
of
the
almighty
in
regard
to
that
people
were
about
to
be
accomplished
and
that
they
would
receive
the
gospel
and
enjoy
its
blessings
the
desire
was
so
great
that
it
was
agreed
upon
that
we
should
inquire
of
the
lord
as
to
the
propriety
of
sending
some
of
the
elders
among
them
which
we
accordingly
did
c

the
result
of
this
inquiry
was
a
revelation
in
which
oliver
cowdery
peter
whitmer
parley
pratt
and
ziba
peterson
were
called
to
go
on
a
mission
to
the
lamanites
who
then
inhabited
the
western
states
and
the
indian
territory
on
their
journey
westward
the
indian
missionaries
stopped
at
kirtland
ohio
where
they
converted
a
number
of
people
to
the
gospel
and
organized
a
branch
of
the
church
it
was
here
that
sidney
rigdon
a
somewhat
noted
campbellite
preacher
resided
and
had
a
large
following
these
campbellites
or
disciples
of
christ
as
they
preferred
to
be
called
were
reformed
baptists
that
is
in
addition
to
believing
that
immersion
is
the
only
acceptable
mode
of
baptism
they
also
taught
that
baptism
when
preceded
by
true
faith
in
god
and
sincere
repentance
was
for
the
remission
of
sins
and
that
forgiveness
of
sins
really
followed
every
proper
baptism
it
was
on
the
occasion
of
this
visit
of
the
indian
missionaries
to
kirtland
that
sidney
rigdon
first
heard
of
joseph
smith
and
mormonism
and
the
first
time
he
ever
saw
the
book
of
mormon
was
when
young
parley
pratt
himself
formerly
a
campbellite
preacher
presented
a
copy
of
it
to
him
to
read
i
think
it
important
to
make
this
statement
here
because
it
has
been
asserted
that
sidney
rigdon
had
much
to
do
with
producing
the
book
of
mormon
the
theory
of
some
being
that
it
was
he
who
stole
from
a
printer
in
pittsburg
a
patterson
a
manuscript
story
written
by
a
sort
of
harebrained
retired
minister
of
the
name
of
solomon
spaulding
and
that
after
making
some
changes
in
the
text
he
then
connived
with
joseph
smith
to
palm
it
off
upon
the
world
as
a
new
revelation
from
god
a
theory
which
in
addition
to
being
absolutely
untrue
always
was
inadequate
as
an
explanation
of
the
origin
of
the
book
of
mormon
and
is
now
quite
generally
abandoned
since
the
manuscript
of
solomon
spaulding
most
unexpectedly
came
to
light
in
verbatim
copies
of
which
have
been
widely
published
the
original
now
being
in
oberlin
college
in
the
state
of
ohio
it
needs
only
a
perusal
of
the
manuscript
found
to
satisfy
anyone
that
it
never
could
in
the
remotest
manner
have
suggested
the
book
of
mormon
or
any
part
of
it
while
the
fact
that
sidney
rigdon
knew
nothing
of
the
book
of
mormon
until
parley
pratt
presented
it
to
him
at
kirtland
ohio
on
the
occasion
above
referred
to
is
a
complete
refutation
of
the
idle
stories
that
he
was
associated
with
joseph
smith
in
writing
the
book
of
mormon
sidney
rigdon
was
born
in
clair
township
allegheny
county
pennsylvania
on
the
of
february
and
was
the
youngest
son
of
william
and
nancy
rigdon
on
his
father
side
his
forefathers
were
english
on
his
mother
irish
in
his
youth
and
early
manhood
he
followed
the
vocation
of
a
farmer
and
tanner
at
the
age
of
he
became
associated
with
a
baptist
society
and
possessing
a
natural
gift
of
oratory
he
drifted
into
the
ministry
of
that
society
he
seems
to
have
been
much
in
doubt
as
to
the
baptist
church
possessing
the
fullness
of
the
truth
and
he
at
last
severed
his
connection
with
it
and
joined
in
the
reform
movement
inaugurated
by
one
alexander
campbell
of
bethany
virginia
founder
of
the
church
of
the
disciples
or
christians
this
new
religious
movement
was
very
successful
in
what
was
called
the
western
reserve
that
region
of
country
lying
south
of
lake
erie
and
constituting
the
present
state
of
ohio
it
derived
its
name
western
reserve
from
the
fact
that
the
state
of
connecticut
in
ceding
its
claims
upon
western
lands
reserved
to
itself
this
magnificent
tract
for
the
purposes
of
a
school
fund
among
the
settlers
on
this
western
reserve
i
repeat
the
doctrines
of
faith
repentance
and
baptism
for
the
remission
of
sins
preached
by
alexander
campbell
sidney
rigdon
parley
pratt
and
others
as
the
cardinal
doctrines
of
christianity
and
the
means
provided
in
the
gospel
for
man
salvation
had
great
success
sidney
rigdon
labors
in
this
new
ministry
led
him
to
settle
at
kirtland
where
he
had
a
large
congregation
the
members
of
which
in
addition
to
accepting
the
primitive
faith
and
ordinances
referred
to
above
were
also
trying
to
carry
out
that
order
of
things
incidentally
mentioned
in
the
early
christian
writings
d
namely
none
of
them
said
that
which
he
possessed
was
his
own
but
they
had
all
things
in
common
footnote
d
acts
such
was
the
state
of
affairs
in
kirtland
and
with
sidney
rigdon
when
parley
pratt
and
his
associates
arrived
there
in
the
fall
of
and
presented
the
book
of
mormon
to
him
and
preached
the
gospel
of
the
dispensation
of
the
fullness
of
times
here
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
speak
a
word
with
reference
to
the
character
of
sidney
rigdon
his
subsequent
prominence
in
the
church
both
the
good
and
the
injury
he
did
it
warrant
my
doing
so
and
will
doubtless
be
a
key
to
his
conduct
that
he
possessed
talents
of
an
extraordinary
nature
goes
without
saying
especially
in
the
line
of
public
speaking
few
men
in
the
church
perhaps
none
have
possessed
the
gift
of
oratory
to
an
equal
degree
spontaneous
fervid
rapid
brilliant
captivating
abounding
in
flights
of
fancy
rich
in
coloring
and
original
in
its
wealth
of
historical
illustration
which
his
wide
and
various
reading
made
possible
it
can
well
be
imagined
how
one
so
gifted
would
be
useful
in
the
work
just
beginning
to
come
forth
through
the
instrumentality
of
joseph
smith
what
a
welcome
the
young
prophet
would
give
to
such
a
and
what
influence
he
would
have
in
the
church
then
struggling
into
existence
the
prophet
could
receive
the
word
of
the
lord
through
the
urim
and
thummim
and
by
the
visitation
of
angels
but
at
that
time
he
was
evidently
lacking
in
ability
to
expound
it
or
show
that
what
he
brought
forth
was
in
harmony
with
the
predictions
of
ancient
prophets
a
part
of
a
great
whole
and
admirably
dovetailed
into
the
general
purposes
and
designs
of
god
neither
his
powers
of
expression
nor
his
historical
information
fitted
him
for
this
task
whatever
his
abilities
in
the
later
years
of
his
ministry
in
the
earlier
days
of
it
he
was
somewhat
slow
of
speech
he
was
as
moses
waiting
for
aaron
and
that
aaron
that
spokesman
he
found
in
sidney
rigdon
and
bade
him
welcome
but
talented
as
sidney
rigdon
was
moral
too
and
spiritually
minded
and
sincere
as
we
believe
him
to
have
been
in
these
early
days
of
his
career
he
possessed
traits
of
character
which
neutralized
to
a
very
great
extent
his
great
abilities
he
was
vain
of
his
talents
vainglorious
of
his
importance
too
proud
of
what
he
regarded
as
his
sacrifices
for
the
truth
the
very
qualities
which
made
him
brilliant
prevented
him
from
being
profound
the
fervid
imagination
which
enabled
him
to
clothe
with
such
splendid
imagery
his
speech
made
him
a
dangerous
man
when
called
to
act
with
reference
to
stern
and
often
disagreeable
and
prosy
realities
he
was
constitutionally
unsound
remarkably
gifted
in
one
or
two
directions
he
was
markedly
deficient
in
others
he
was
wanting
in
soundness
of
judgment
steadiness
of
purpose
a
high
sense
of
honor
he
was
moody
petty
jealous
selfish
and
in
a
word
lacked
that
mysterious
quality
so
well
expressed
by
the
phrase
weight
of
character
but
with
all
his
imperfections
he
was
useful
and
for
many
years
was
faithful
and
devoted
to
the
prophet
and
the
work
of
god
he
was
an
instrument
in
the
hands
of
the
almighty
through
whom
was
accomplished
much
good
he
endured
much
for
the
truth
sake
persecution
poverty
imprisonment
mob
violence
almost
death
for
such
men
whatever
may
be
their
defects
of
character
especially
when
such
defects
are
constitutional
the
effect
of
temperament
we
can
have
but
the
kindest
sentiments
and
only
make
mention
of
such
defects
as
they
may
have
possessed
in
order
to
bring
to
pass
a
proper
understanding
of
events
with
which
they
were
associated
at
kirtland
frederick
williams
who
subsequently
occupied
an
important
station
in
the
church
counselor
to
the
prophet
joseph
in
the
first
presidency
was
also
baptized
he
volunteered
to
accompany
the
indian
missionaries
on
their
journey
westward
the
indian
missionaries
arrived
at
independence
missouri
in
midwinter
independence
was
then
a
frontier
town
one
of
the
outposts
of
advancement
westward
it
was
on
the
line
that
divided
our
frontier
from
the
possessions
of
the
red
man
west
of
the
great
missouri
river
and
it
can
be
very
well
understood
that
its
civilization
was
not
of
the
highest
order
here
had
drifted
many
outcasts
from
society
and
there
was
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
writing
very
little
regard
for
god
religion
refinement
or
for
civilization
as
the
indian
missionaries
were
destitute
and
weary
from
the
extended
journey
on
foot
through
what
at
that
time
was
at
best
but
a
country
and
very
much
of
it
wilderness
it
was
arranged
that
two
of
the
company
who
had
been
tailors
should
obtain
work
at
their
trade
in
independence
while
the
three
others
should
cross
the
frontier
line
and
enter
the
reservation
occupied
by
the
shawnees
and
the
delaware
indians
the
chief
of
the
delawares
who
is
described
by
elder
parley
pratt
as
a
venerable
looking
man
and
the
sachem
of
ten
nations
or
tribes
called
together
some
forty
chief
men
of
his
people
and
to
these
oliver
cowdery
delivered
in
substance
the
following
message
aged
chief
and
venerable
council
of
the
delaware
nation
we
are
glad
of
this
opportunity
to
address
you
as
our
red
brethren
and
friends
we
have
traveled
a
long
distance
from
towards
the
rising
sun
to
bring
you
glad
news
we
have
traveled
the
wilderness
crossed
the
deep
and
wide
rivers
and
waded
in
the
deep
snows
and
in
the
face
of
the
storms
of
winter
to
communicate
to
you
great
knowledge
which
has
lately
come
to
our
ears
and
hearts
and
which
will
do
the
red
man
good
as
well
as
the
pale
face
once
the
red
men
were
many
they
occupied
the
country
from
sea
to
sea
from
the
rising
sun
to
the
setting
sun
the
whole
land
was
theirs
the
great
spirit
gave
it
to
them
and
no
pale
faces
dwelt
among
them
but
now
they
are
few
in
numbers
their
possessions
are
small
and
the
pale
faces
are
many
thousands
of
moons
ago
when
the
red
man
forefathers
dwelt
in
peace
and
possessed
this
whole
land
the
great
spirit
talked
with
them
and
revealed
his
law
and
his
will
and
much
knowledge
to
their
wise
men
and
prophets
this
they
wrote
in
a
book
together
with
their
history
and
the
things
which
should
befall
their
children
in
the
latter
days
this
book
was
written
on
plates
of
gold
and
handed
down
from
father
to
son
for
many
ages
and
generations
it
was
then
that
the
people
prospered
and
were
strong
and
mighty
they
cultivated
the
earth
built
buildings
and
cities
and
abounded
in
all
good
things
as
the
pale
faces
now
do
but
they
became
wicked
they
killed
one
another
and
shed
much
blood
they
killed
their
prophets
and
wise
men
and
sought
to
destroy
the
book
the
great
spirit
became
angry
and
would
speak
to
them
no
more
they
had
no
good
and
wise
dreams
no
more
visions
no
more
angels
sent
among
them
by
the
great
spirit
and
the
lord
commanded
mormon
and
moroni
their
last
wise
men
and
prophets
to
hide
the
book
in
the
earth
that
it
might
be
preserved
in
safety
and
be
found
and
made
known
in
the
latter
day
to
the
pale
faces
who
should
possess
the
land
that
they
might
again
make
it
known
to
the
red
men
in
order
to
restore
them
to
the
knowledge
of
the
will
of
the
great
spirit
and
to
his
favor
and
if
the
red
men
would
then
receive
this
book
and
learn
the
things
written
in
it
and
do
according
thereunto
they
should
be
restored
to
all
their
rights
and
privileges
should
cease
to
fight
and
kill
one
another
should
become
one
people
cultivate
the
earth
in
peace
in
common
with
the
pale
faces
who
are
willing
to
believe
and
obey
the
same
book
and
be
good
men
and
live
in
peace
then
should
the
red
men
become
great
and
have
plenty
to
eat
and
good
clothes
to
wear
and
should
be
in
favor
with
the
great
spirit
and
be
his
children
while
he
would
be
their
great
father
and
talk
with
them
and
raise
up
prophets
and
wise
and
good
men
amongst
them
again
who
should
teach
them
many
things
this
book
which
contained
these
things
was
hid
in
the
earth
by
moroni
in
a
hill
called
by
him
cumorah
which
hill
is
now
in
the
state
of
new
york
near
the
village
of
palmyra
in
ontario
county
in
that
neighborhood
there
lived
a
young
man
named
joseph
smith
who
prayed
to
the
great
spirit
much
in
order
that
he
might
know
the
truth
and
the
great
spirit
sent
an
angel
to
him
and
told
him
where
this
book
was
hidden
by
moroni
and
commanded
him
to
get
it
he
accordingly
went
to
the
place
and
dug
in
the
earth
and
found
the
book
written
on
gold
plates
but
it
was
written
in
the
language
of
the
forefathers
of
the
red
men
therefore
this
young
man
being
a
pale
face
could
not
understand
it
but
the
angel
told
him
and
showed
him
and
gave
him
knowledge
of
the
language
and
how
to
interpret
the
book
so
he
interpreted
it
into
the
language
of
the
pale
faces
and
wrote
it
on
paper
and
caused
it
to
be
printed
and
published
thousands
of
copies
of
it
among
them
and
then
sent
us
to
the
red
men
to
bring
some
copies
of
it
to
them
and
to
tell
them
this
news
so
we
have
now
come
from
him
and
here
is
a
copy
of
the
book
which
we
now
present
to
our
red
friend
the
chief
of
the
delawares
and
which
we
hope
he
will
cause
to
be
read
and
known
among
his
tribe
it
will
do
them
good
to
these
remarks
the
indian
chief
made
the
following
reply
we
feel
truly
thankful
to
our
white
friends
who
have
come
so
far
and
been
at
such
pains
to
tell
us
good
news
and
especially
this
news
concerning
the
book
of
our
forefathers
it
makes
us
glad
in
here
placing
his
hand
on
his
heart
it
is
now
winter
we
are
new
settlers
in
this
place
the
snow
is
deep
our
cattle
and
horses
are
dying
our
wigwams
are
poor
we
have
much
to
do
in
the
spring
to
build
houses
and
fence
and
make
farms
but
we
will
build
a
council
house
and
meet
together
and
you
shall
read
to
us
and
teach
us
more
concerning
the
book
of
our
fathers

the
will
of
the

the
interest
awakened
among
the
indians
by
the
brethren
aroused
the
jealousy
of
sectarian
missionaries
who
were
also
at
work
among
this
tribe
they
falsely
charged
the
elders
with
disturbing
the
peace
and
through
their
influence
with
the
indian
agents
secured
the
banishment
of
the

the
indian
missionaries
after
their
banishment
met
with
their
brethren
at
independence
on
the
of
february
for
consultation
as
to
their
future
movements
it
was
finally
agreed
by
the
meeting
that
parley

should
return
to
ohio
and
report
their
labors
to
the
prophet
elder
pratt
immediately
set
out
upon
this
long
journey
and
after
enduring
much
fatigue
and
sickness
he
arrived
early
in
the
spring
at
kirtland
where
he
found
the
prophet
joseph
smith
to
whom
he
reported
the
labors
of
himself
and
companions
how
joseph
smith
came
to
be
in

at
this
particular
time
is

interest
after
joining
the
church
at
kirtland
under
the
ministrations
of
oliver
cowdery
parley
pratt
and
others
sidney
rigdon
in
company
with
edward
partridge
who
had
not
yet
received
baptism
determined
upon
a
personal
visit
to
the
prophet
in
new
york
they
arrived
at
fayette
new
york
early
in
the
month
of
december
and
soon
thereafter
the
prophet
received
revelations
which
must
have
been
a
source
of
great
comfort
to
these
brethren
sidney
rigdon
was
declared
to
have
been
inspired
of
god
and
sent
forth
to
prepare
the
way
before
the
coming
of
the
lord
and
of
elijah
though
he
knew
it
not
he
had
baptized
by
water
unto
repentance
but
those
who
received
his
ministrations
did
not
receive
the
holy
ghost
now
he
was
called
to
a
greater
work
and
was
promised
that
the
baptism
of
the
holy
ghost
under
his
hands
should
follow
the
baptism
of
the
water
even
as
was
the
case
with
the
apostles
of
old
he
was
commanded
to
tarry
with
joseph
smith
and
assist
him
in
writing
and
in
counseling
with
him
in
relation
to
the
great
work
that
the
lord
was
bringing
forth
edward
partridge
who
is
described
by
the
prophet
as
a
pattern
of
piety
one
of
the
lord
great
men
and
like
nathaniel
of
old
a
man
in
whom
there
was
no
guile
after
some
investigation
of
the
truth
was
baptized
by
the
prophet
in
seneca
lake
and
was
also
called
by
revelation
to
the
ministry
the
addition
of
these
brethren
to
the
church
greatly
strengthened
the
ministry
they
preached
almost
daily
and
were
frequently
engaged
in
receiving
the
word
of
the
lord
by
revelation
and
through
the
revision
of
the
scriptures
for
it
had
been
made
known
that
in
consequence
of
imperfections
in
translation
in
some
instances
and
the
omission
of
many
plain
and
precious
parts
in
other
instances
the
scriptures
the
old
and
new
testaments
were
imperfect
and
hence
the
necessity
for
the
revision
finally
the
brethren
received
a
commandment
that
after
they
had
strengthened
the
church
in
these
parts
they
should
go
to
ohio
the
church
in
new
york
was
also
commanded
to
gather
to
ohio
which
commandment
by
the
way
is
the
first
one
given
to
the
church
to
gather
together
in
this
dispensation
obedient
to
this
commandment
joseph
smith
in
company
with
elders
rigdon
and
partridge
and
with
his
family
about
the
latter
part
of
january
removed
to
kirtland
where
he
received
a
hearty
welcome
and
was
there
when
parley
pratt
arrived
from
the
west
with
his
report
of
the
labors
of
the
indian
missionaries
as
already
stated
what
effect
this
indian
mission
report
had
upon
the
mind
of
the
prophet
he
has
left
no
word
to
indicate
but
that
a
deep
impression
was
made
upon
him
and
that
he
attached
much
importance
to
that
mission
can
scarcely
be
doubted
because
of
the
mighty
consequences
which
subsequently
grew
out
of
it
since
the
departure
of
the
indian
missionaries
for
the
west
a
very
great
amount
of
knowledge
had
been
revealed
concerning
the
work
of
the
lord
in
the
last
days
soon
after
the
arrival
of
sidney
rigdon
at
fayette
in
new
york
as
already
related
work
upon
the
translation
of
scripture
was
begun
and
among
the
ancient
scriptures
that
were
revealed
in
the
course
of
this
work
was
the
prophecy
of
enoch

is
alluded

that
it
was
the
will
of
the
lord
that
the
elders
who
had
been
sent
out
to
preach
in
the
regions
round
about
should
be
called
together
and
this
led
to
the
appointment
of
a
somewhat
notable
conference
of
the
church
that
was
called
to
meet
on
the
sixth
day
of
june
ensuing
on
the
of
march
the
lord
gave
a
somewhat
lengthy
revelation
setting
forth
the
judgments
that
should
come
upon
the
generation
in
which
this
new
dispensation
of
the
gospel
came
forth
in
the
course
of
which
it
is
said
wherefore
i
the
lord
have
said
gather
ye
out
from
the
eastern
lands
assemble
ye
yourselves
together
ye
elders
of
my
church
go
ye
forth
into
the
western
countries
call
upon
the
inhabitants
to
repent
and
inasmuch
as
they
do
repent
build
up
churches
unto
me
and
with
one
heart
and
with
one
mind
gather
up
your
riches
that
ye
may
purchase
an
inheritance
which
shall
hereafter
be
appointed
unto
you
and
it
shall
be
called
the
new
jerusalem
a
land
of
peace
a
city
of
refuge
a
place
of
safety
for
the
saints
of
the
most
high
god
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
shall
be
there
insomuch
that
the
wicked
will
not
come
unto
it
and
it
shall
be
called
zion
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
among
the
wicked
that
every
man
that
will
not
take
his
sword
against
his
neighbor
must
needs
flee
unto
zion
for
safety
and
there
shall
be
gathered
unto
it
out
of
every
nation
under
heaven
and
it
shall
be
the
only
people
that
shall
not
be
at
war
one
with
another
and
it
shall
be
said
among
the
wicked
let
us
not
go
up
to
battle
against
zion
for
the
inhabitants
of
zion
are
terrible
wherefore
we
can
not
stand

for
a
time
however
both
the
saints
who
had
come
from
new
york
in
obedience
to
the
commandment
from
the
lord
and
also
the
saints
in
ohio
were
commanded
by
revelation
to
remain
in
ohio
for
the
present
the
saints
in
the
latter
state
being
called
upon
to
share
their
lands
with
their
eastern
brethren
it

continues
the
revelation
that
ye
save
all

money
that
ye
can
and
that
ye
obtain
all
that
ye
can
in
righteousness
that

thus
it
will
be
seen
that
considerable
knowledge
had
been
imparted
to
the
church
concerning
zion
during
the
absence
of
the
indian
missionaries
and
as
all
the
revelations
indicated
that
the
location
of
zion
was
in
the
west
very
naturally
the
interest
of
the
church
was
intense
concerning
this
indian
mission
operating
on
the
very
western
borders
of
american
civilization
this
brings
us
to
the
before
mentioned
conference
appointed
for
the
of
june
chapter
iii
in
search
of
zion
the
conference
of
the
church
appointed
for
the
of
june
assembled
on
that
date
in
kirtland
it
was
an
occasion
of
great
importance
in
what
way
it
was
done
is
not
recorded
but
the
prophet
in
speaking
of
the
matter
says
the
lord
displayed
his
power
in
a
manner
that
could
not
be
mistaken
he
further
recounts
that
the
man
of
sin
was
revealed
and
the
authority
of
the
melchisedek
priesthood
was
manifested
and
conferred
for
the
first
time
upon
several
of
the
elders
it
is
clearly
evident
says
the
prophet
that
the
lord
gives
us
power
in
proportion
to
the
work
to
be
done
and
strength
according
to
the
race
set
before
us
and
grace
and
help
as
our
needs
require
the
day
following
june
the
lord
in
a
revelation
given
through
the
prophet
appointed
the
next
conference
to
convene
in
missouri
upon
the
land
which
i
will
consecrate
unto
my
people
which
are
a
remnant
of
jacob
and
them
who
are
heirs
according
to
the
covenant
wherefore
verily
i
say
unto
you
let
my
servants
joseph
smith
and
sidney
rigdon
take
their
journey
as
soon
as
preparations
can
be
made
to
leave
their
homes
and
journey
to
the
land
of
missouri
and
inasmuch
as
they
are
faithful
unto
me
it
shall
be
made
known
unto
them
what
they
shall
do
and
it
shall
also
inasmuch
as
they
are
faithful
be
made
known
unto
them
the
land
of
your
inheritance
this
announcement
caused
great
joy
to
the
conference
the
place
for
the
zion
of
god
the
new
jerusalem
was
to
be
made
known
it
was
to
be
the
land
of
their
inheritance
the
city
which
enoch
the
seventh
from
adam
saw
in
its
splendor
the
city
of
refuge
for
the
righteous
in
the
last
days
the
city
of
peace
the
joy
of
the
godly
the
terror
of
the
wicked
this
city
was
to
be
located
and
they
were
to
be
instruments
in
the
founding
of
it
small
wonder
if
the
thought
of
it
exalted
them
until
even
the
weak
felt
strong
and
the
strong
yet
more
powerful
elders
in
all
were
called
by
name
to
go
in
different
directions
through
the
western
states
two
by
two
preaching
by
the
way
in
every
congregation
baptizing
by
water
and
the
laying
on
of
hands
by
the
water
side
they
were
to
meet
in
western
missouri
in
a
conference
appointed
at
that
place
and
there
learn
the
location
of
zion
soon
after
the
close
of
the
conference
the
elders
started
upon
this
mission
some
going
on
foot
others
going
part
way
by
stage
and
steamboat
the
prophet
in
company
with
sidney
rigdon
martin
harris
edward
partridge
phelps
joseph
coe
gilbert
and
wife
left
kirtland
for
missouri
cincinnati
and
louis
at
cincinnati
the
prophet
joseph
had
an
interview
with
rev
walter
scott
the
associate
of
alexander
campbell
in
founding
the
sect
of
the
disciples
or
campbellites
it
was
with
these
gentlemen
that
sidney
rigdon
was
associated
in
a
religious
reform
movement
to
which
reference
has
already
been
made
their
design
was
to
primitive
christianity
this
object
they
proposed
to
achieve
by
discarding
all
creeds
and
accepting
the
bible
alone
and
especially
the
new
testament
as
the
authority
and
groundwork
of
their
faith
their
cardinal
doctrines
were
faith
in
god
and
in
jesus
christ
repentance
of
sin
and
baptism
by
immersion
for
the
remission
of
sins
followed
by
righteousness
of
life
this
unquestionably
was
a
good
beginning
in
the
way
of
restoring
the
primitive
christian
faith
most
of
the
fundamentals
of
the
christian
faith
are
here
and
if
sidney
rigdon
as
the
lord
declared
was
sent
forth
even
as
john
the
baptist
to
prepare
the
way
before
the
lord
jesus
and
elijah
though
he
knew
it
not
then
undoubtedly
alexander
campbell
and
walter
scott
who
were
engaged
in
the
same
work
were
also
sent
forth
to
prepare
the
way
before
the
lord
certain
it
is
that
alexander
campbell
did
a
great
work
among
the
protestant
sects
of
the
united
states
in
getting
them
to
turn
from
the
creeds
of
men
to
the
scriptures
and
the
elders
of
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
have
found
in
the
sect
of
the
disciples
more
who
would
listen
to
their
teachings
and
a
greater
proportion
of
them
who
would
accept
the
fullness
of
the
gospel
than
among
any
other
sect
and
those
among
them
who
have
rejected
the
fullness
of
the
gospel
when
it
was
presented
to
them
have
failed
to
understand
aright
the
meaning
of
the
reform
movement
they
have
failed
to
recognize
in
that
movement
merely
a
preparation
for
the
incoming
of
the
fullness
of
the
gospel
that
their
teaching
was
not
a
complete
return
to
the
christianity
of
the
new
testament
ought
to
have
been
clear
to
them
especially
to
the
originators
of
the
movement
they
lacked
divine
authority
divine
commission
from
god
to
administer
the
sacraments
of
the
gospel
they
baptized
only
with
water
for
the
remission
of
sins
the
baptism
of
the
holy
ghost
apparently
unknown
to
them
is
equally
a
vital
part
of
primitive
christianity
and
is
as
plainly
taught
in
the
new
testament
as
an
essential
to
salvation
as
water
baptism
they
lacked
the
organization
of
the
primitive
church
apostles
prophets
bishops
elders
teachers
deacons
etc
and
especially
were
they
lacking
in
the
enjoyment
of
those
spiritual
gifts
of
the
gospel
so
prominent
a
characteristic
of
the
primitive
christian
church
unfortunately
and
very
unlike
sidney
rigdon
both
campbell
and
scott
violently
opposed
the
work
of
god
brought
forth
by
joseph
smith
alexander
campbell
through
his
millennial
harbinger
bitterly
assailed
both
the
book
of
mormon
and
the
character
of
joseph
smith
and
scott
in
this
cincinnati
interview
with
the
prophet
opposed
the
work
strenuously
for
that
it
set
forth
that
men
accepting
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
were
now
entitled
to
the
same
spiritual
powers
and
gifts
as
were
enjoyed
in
the
primitive
church
before
the
close
of
our
interview
says
the
prophet
he
manifested
one
of
the
bitterest
spirits
against
the
doctrine
of
the
new
testament
that
these
signs
shall
follow
them
that
believe
as
recorded
in
the
chapter
of
the
gospel
according
to
mark
that
i
ever
witnessed
among
men
from
louis
those
who
continued
in
the
company
of
the
prophet
made
the
journey
on
foot
to
independence
where
they
arrived
about
the
middle
of
july
in
a
few
days
the
other
elders
of
this
mission
through
the
western
states
began
to
arrive
these
men
had
suffered
all
the
hardships
incident
to
a
long
journey
performed
for
the
most
part
on
foot
through
a
sparsely
settled
country
and
in
the
hot
summer
months
but
the
consciousness
that
they
were
seeking
the
place
of
the
city
of
zion
that
they
had
been
promised
on
condition
of
their
faithfulness
that
its
location
would
be
revealed
to
them
that
it
should
be
the
land
of
their
inheritance
sustained
them
in
every
trial
and
made
the
journey
pleasant
to
them
the
meeting
between
these
brethren
from
the
eastern
states
and
the
elders
of
the
indian
mission
who
had
remained
at
independence
since
the
departure
of
elder
pratt
to
report
their
operations
to
the
prophet
at
kirtland
was
a
memorable
one
those
from
the
east
could
tell
their
brethren
of
the
west
of
the
expansion
of
the
church
both
in
numbers
and
in
doctrine
of
the
commandment
of
the
church
to
gather
from
new
york
to
ohio
of
the
appointment
of
a
bishop
in
the
church
of
the
revelation
of
the
prophecy
of
enoch
in
which
they
had
learned
more
about
the
city
of
zion
of
the
other
revelations
that
had
been
given
upon
that
same
subject
the
city
of
zion
the
promise
of
god
to
reveal
the
place
where
eventually
it
is
to
be
founded
the
laws
that
must
govern
its
inhabitants
of
the
glory
which
at
last
it
shall
possess
and
finally
of
their
journey
toward
the
place
where
it
had
been
indicated
its
location
was
and
all
the
incidents
that
had
happened
on
the
way
westward
all
these
and
a
thousand
other
things
their
hopes
for
the
advancement
of
the
kingdom
the
peace
of
zion
that
shall
be
the
safety
the
glory
all
these
were
interesting
themes
for
conversation
of
their
meeting
the
prophet
himself
said
the
meeting
with
our
brethren
who
had
long
waited
our
arrival
was
a
glorious
one
and
moistened
with
many
tears
it
seemed
good
and
pleasant
for
brethren
to
meet
together
in
unity
but
our
reflections
were
great
coming
as
we
had
from
a
highly
cultivated
state
of
society
in
the
east
and
standing
now
upon
the
confines
or
western
limits
of
the
united
states
and
looking
into
the
vast
wilderness
of
those
that
sat
in
darkness
how
natural
it
was
to
observe
the
degradation
leanness
of
intellect
ferocity
and
jealousy
of
a
people
that
were
nearly
a
century
behind
the
times
and
to
feel
for
those
who
roamed
about
without
the
benefit
of
civilization
refinement
or
religion
yea
and
to
exclaim
in
the
language
of
the
prophets
when
will
the
wilderness
blossom
as
the
rose
when
will
zion
be
built
up
in
her
glory
and
where
will
thy
temple
stand
unto
which
all
nations
shall
come
in
the
last
days
the
brethren
were
not
long
left
in
doubt
upon
this
subject
for
within
a
day
or
two
the
date
of
the
revelation
is
not
definitely
known
further
than
the
fact
that
it
was
given
in
july
a
revelation
was
given
in
which
the
lord
made
known
that
missouri
was
the
land
which
the
lord
had
appointed
and
consecrated
for
the
gathering
of
his
people
wherefore
this
is
the
land
of
promise
said
the
lord
and
the
place
for
the
city
of
zion
and
behold
the
place
which
is
now
called
independence
is
the
center
place
and
a
spot
for
the
temple
is
lying
westward
upon
a
lot
which
is
not
far
from
the
court
house
a
footnote
a
doc
cov
sec
the
saints
were
commanded
to
purchase
this
land
and
that
lying
westward
to
the
extent
of
their
ability
that
they
might
obtain
it
as
an
everlasting
inheritance
sidney
gilbert
was
appointed
an
agent
to
the
church
to
receive
money
and
to
purchase
lands
and
also
to
engage
in
the
business
of
a
general
merchant
the
proceeds
of
which
business
were
to
be
used
in
the
purchase
of
lands
edward
partridge
by
virtue
of
his
office
as
bishop
was
to
divide
to
the
saints
their
inheritance
as
the
lands
were
purchased
phelps
was
to
be
established
as
a
printer
and
publisher
to
the
church
in
zion
assisted
by
oliver
cowdery
immediate
preparations
were
to
be
made
by
the
bishop
and
his
agents
for
settling
the
families
then
on
their
way
from
the
east
to
settle
in
zion
the
first
sunday
after
the
arrival
of
the
elders
of
this
western
mission
a
public
meeting
was
held
over
the
western
boundary
of
the
united
states
such
a
congregation
was
present
as
was
only
possible
in
an
american
frontier
district
indians
negroes
then
slaves
and
all
classes
and
conditions
of
people
from
the
surrounding
counties
universalists
atheists
deists
presbyterians
methodists
baptists
both
priests
and
people
a
motly
crowd
truly
at
the
conclusion
of
the
services
two
were
baptized
but
they
were
not
the
fruits
of
this
meeting
as
they
previously
believed
the
gospel
during
the
week
following
the
colesville
branch
of
the
church
which
had
emigrated
bodily
from
colesville
broome
county
state
of
new
york
arrived
and
settled
in
the
edge
of
an
extensive
prairie
about
twelve
miles
west
of
independence
and
in
what
must
now
be
the
suburbs
of
kansas
city
it
is
worth
while
observing
as
we
pass
that
this
branch
of
the
church
was
made
up
wholly
of
northern
people
and
therefore
constituted
a
different
class
of
settlers
from
the
old
inhabitants
of
independence
who
came
chiefly
from
the
south
they
had
been
commanded
to
come
to
western
missouri
in
a
body
with
a
view
to
permanently
settling
in
the
land
of
zion
when
that
place
should
be
designated
and
in
this
their
mission
differed
from
that
given
to
the
elders
who
were
commanded
to
travel
two
and
two
preaching
the
gospel
through
the
western
states
en
route
for
missouri
these
people
were
unquestionably
plunged
into
new
conditions
they
had
been
reared
in
a
district
of
new
york
where
the
land
was
heavily
timbered
and
where
to
clear
a
farm
for
cultivation
took
the
lifetime
of
one
generation
but
here
they
found
alternate
woodland
and
prairie
great
stretches
of
open
country
which
only
needed
to
be
fenced
to
be
ready
for
plowing
and
doubtless
their
hearts
swelled
with
gratitude
when
they
contemplated
the
possibilities
and
prosperity
that
could
come
to
the
industrious
in
such
a
goodly
land
they
soon
set
about
their
work
of
founding
zion
for
on
the
day
of
august
they
began

that
a

to

the

the
city
of

is
to
be
built
will
ever
be
of
interest
to
the
saints
and
i
therefore
give
the
following
description
of
that
section
of
missouri
the
missouri
river
though
flowing
east
in
the
main
takes
a
meandering
course
through
the
state
to
which
it
has
given
its
name
the
river
bottom
is
a
low
strip
of
land
on
either
bank
of
the
stream
and
varies
in
width
from
a
few
hundred
yards
to
several
miles
the
character
of
the
soil
in
the
bottom
is
of
course
alluvial
and
very
fertile
the
missouri
is
said
to
be
a
treacherous
stream
by
the
people
living
on
its
banks
by
that
they
mean
it
frequently
changes
its
channel
several
places
were
pointed
out
to
me
as
i
passed
down
it
that
used
to
be
the
main
channel
of
the
stream
but
which
are
now
overgrown
with
trees
underbrush
and
fields
of
waving
corn
while
here
and
there
the
stream
is
cutting
its
banks
and
mass
after
mass
of
sandy
alluvial
deposit
of
former
times
is
caving
in
the
river
is
cutting
for
itself
a
new
channel
or
moving
obstructions
from
an
old
one
in
which
it
flowed
ages
ago
but
however
often
the
missouri
may
change
its
banks
the
main
stream
never
leaves
the
river
bottoms
for
the
reason
that
these
bottoms
are
walled
in
by
the
bluffs
the
word
bluff
naturally
suggests
to
the
mind
rugged
cliffs
rising
almost
perpendicularly
from
the
bottoms
to
dizzy
heights
but
such
are
not
the
bluffs
of
the
missouri
while
occasionally
one
may
see
a
bold
cliff
rising
from
the
water
edge
yet
they
are
not
numerous
the
missouri
bluffs
are
sharp
rolling
hills
that
run
parallel
with
the
river
on
either
side
and
are
usually
timbered
they
vary
in
width
sometimes
extending
ten
or
fifteen
miles
and
then
again
narrowed
down
to
a
few
hundred
yards
by
some
patch
of
prairie
that
approaches
very
nearly
to
the
river
bank
back
from
these
bluffs
are
stretched
out
great
rolling
prairies
the
extent
of
which
quite
bewilders
one
they
are
divided
into
what
appear
to
be
immense
meadows
by
the
strips
of
timber
land
which
invariably
border
the
winding
streams
standing
on
an
eminence
that
overlooks
these
alternate
prairie
and
timber
lands
extending
as
they
do
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
with
here
and
there
a
crowning
hill
ornamented
with
a
pretentious
farm
house
or
some
more
humble
dwelling
half
hidden
from
your
view
by
the
thick
foliage
of
the
trees
with
cattle
feeding
on
a
thousand
hills
all
this
is
very
likely
to
make
the
beholder
imagine
himself
in
some
enchanted
realm

being
mild

the

of

is
for
the
most
part
a
rich
black
loam
in
places
intermingled
with
sand
and

is
from
two
to
ten

in
speaking
of
some
parts
of
africa
says
the
people
tickle
the
soil
with
a
hoe
and
it
laughs
with
plenty
it
is
so
with
the
land
of
zion
though
the
supply
of
timber
useful
for
lumber
purposes
is
nearly
exhausted
you
still
find
luxuriant
growths
of
hickory
some
black
walnut

and

huge
sycamores

wild

roamed
over

was
once

civilization
however
has
driven
away
nearly
all
these
animals

the
larger
ones

they
are
replaced
by
the
domestic
species

useful
to

for

that

is
the
land
of
zion
as
i
found
it
a
land
with
resources
unlimited
a
land
yielding
an
abundance
of
all
useful
products
though
but
indifferently
cultivated
by
the
husbandmen
who
possess
it
a
land
of
surpassing
loveliness
though
its
beauties
are
often
marred
rather
than
increased
by
those
who
inhabit
it
while
its
magnificent
resources
are
very
far
from
anything
like
complete
development
the
land
being
thus
beautiful
in
its
products
when
only
partially
developed
the
mind
naturally
inquires
what
will
it
be
when
its
resources
are
fully
developed
when
the
idleness
and
indifference
of
its
people
shall
be
banished
when
it
shall
be
possessed
by
the
saints
of
the
most
high
who
will
consecrate
their
substance
for
the
building
of
zion
and
all
their
exertions
will
be
to
glorify
god
and
benefit
mankind
when
covetousness
is
subdued
and
virtue
and
righteousness
shall
reign
in
every
heart
and
when
under
the
blessings
of
jehovah
the
land
shall
yield
in
its
strength
when
the
glory
of
lebanon
shall
be
brought
to
zion
the
fir
tree
the
pine
tree
and
the
box
tree
together
when
for
brass
will
be
brought
gold
and
for
iron
silver
for
wood
brass
and
for
stones
iron
to
glorify
the
place
of
god
sanctuary
surely
when
this
shall
come
to
pass
the
land
of
zion
shall
be
the
perfection
of
beauty
independence
designated
as
the
center
place
of
zion
is
in
the
northern
part
of
jackson
county
about
three
or
four
miles
south
of
the
missouri
river
it
is
located
nearly
midway
between
two
small
rivers
which
flow
northward
and
empty
into
the
missouri
the
stream
on
the
west
is
called
big
blue
and
the
one
on
the
east
little
blue
the
town
is
situated
in
the
river
bluffs
already
described
as
sharp
rolling
hills
many
of
which
at
one
time
were
covered
with
fine
growths
of
timber
and
even
now
some
of
them
are
partially
covered
with
beautiful
groves
independence
in
as
stated
in
a
previous
chapter
was
a
frontier
town
with
all
the
disadvantages
implied
by
that
term
it
had
a
mixed
population
of
white
men
from
many
sections
of
the
union
chiefly
however
from
the
south
some
of
whom
had
moved
into
the
western
wilderness
to
escape
the
consequences
of
unlawful
deeds
committed
elsewhere
vagabond
indians
and
renegades
who
had
mingled
with
them
besides
a
number
of
negro
slaves
society
was
as
varied
as
the
character
of
the
population
but
on
the
whole
may
be
described
as
being
without
stability
regard
for
law
or
religion
of
late
years
of
course
the
character
of
independence
has
been
entirely
changed
western
missouri
is
no
longer
the
frontier
of
the
united
states
nor
is
independence
a
frontier
town
it
is
now
a
delightful
residence
suburb
of
kansas
city
missouri
with
many
attractive
homes
having
given
a
description
of
the
land
of
zion
and
the
town
of
independence
it
may
be
interesting
to
learn
something
concerning
the
city
of
zion
that
shall
yet
stand
there
to
the
glory
of
god
of
necessity
the
description
will
be
imperfect
as
the
available
materials
for
such
description
are
very
meagre
while
the
prophets
have
written
much
concerning
zion
and
her
future
glory
their
rapturous
effusions
do
not
furnish
matter
for
a
definite
description
of
the
city
in
june
however
joseph
smith
and
the
elders
in
kirtland
ohio
sent
a
plat
of
the
city
to
the
brethren
in
missouri
we
have
been
unable
to
find
the
plat
but
an
explanation
of
it
is
recorded
in
the
history
of
joseph
smith
a
from
which
we
learn
the
following
footnote
a
millennial
star
vol
the
city
plat
is
one
mile
square
divided
into
blocks
containing
ten
acres
each
forty
rods
square
except
the
middle
range
of
blocks
running
north
and
south
they
will
be
forty
by
sixty
rods
containing
fifteen
acres
having
their
greatest
extent
east
and
west
the
streets
will
be
eight
rods
wide
intersecting
each
other
at
right
angles
the
tier
of
blocks
forty
by
sixty
rods
will
be
reserved
for
public
buildings
temples
tabernacles
school
houses
etc
b
footnote
b
by
this
arrangement
it
will
be
observed
that
the
blocks
in
the
city
can
not
be
uniformly
forty
rods
square
if
the
middle
range
of
blocks
running
north
and
south
are
made
forty
by
sixty
as
the
plat
east
and
west
would
lack
rods
and
north
and
south
eight
rods
of
being
sufficient
for
such
an
arrangement
either
the
outside
tier
of
blocks
must
be
less
than
forty
rods
square
or
the
city
plat
must
be
more
than
a
mile
square
it
must
be
three
hundred
and
rods
east
and
west
instead
of
three
hundred
and
twenty
by
three
hundred
and
north
and
b
all
the
other
blocks
will
be
divided
into
lots
a
four
rod
front
to
every
lot
and
extending
back
twenty
rods
in
one
block
the
lots
will
run
from
the
north
and
south
and
in
the
next
one
from
the
east
and
west
and
so
on
alternately
throughout
the
city
except
in
the
range
of
blocks
reserved
for
public
buildings
by
this
arrangement
no
street
will
be
built
on
entirely
through
the
street
but
on
one
block
the
houses
will
stand
on
one
street
and
on
the
next
one
on
another
street
all
of
the
houses
are
to
be
built
of
brick
or
stone
and
but
one
house
on
a
lot
which
is
to
stand
feet
back
from
the
street
the
space
in
front
being
for
lawns
ornamental
trees
shrubbery
or
flowers
according
to
the
taste
of
the
owners
the
rest
of
the
lot
will
be
for
gardens
etc
it
is
supposed
that
such
a
plat
when
built
up
will
contain
fifteen
or
twenty
thousand
population
and
that
they
will
require
buildings
to
supply
them
with
houses
for
public
worship
and
schools
these
buildings
will
be
temples
none
of
which
will
be
less
than
feet
by
and
two
stories
high
each
story
to
be
fourteen
feet
making
the
building
feet
to
the
square
i
say
none
of
these
temples
will
be
smaller
than
this
but
of
course
there
will
be
others
much
larger
the
above
however
are
the
dimensions
of
the
one
the
saints
were
commanded
to
build
first
lands
on
the
north
and
south
of
the
city
will
be
laid
off
for
barns
and
stables
for
the
use
of
the
city
so
there
will
be
no
barns
or
stables
in
the
city
among
the
homes
of
the
people
lands
for
the
agriculturist
are
also
to
be
laid
off
on
the
north
and
south
of
the
city
plat
but
if
sufficient
land
can
not
be
laid
off
without
going
too
great
a
distance
then
farms
are
to
be
laid
off
on
the
east
and
west
also
but
the
tiller
of
the
soil
as
well
as
the
merchant
and
mechanic
will
live
in
the
city
the
farmer
and
his
family
therefore
will
enjoy
all
the
advantages
of
schools
public
lectures
and
other
meetings
his

they
were

as
several
families
living
in
an
open
unfinished
log
room
without
windows

nothing

this

was
as
follows
every
man
was
to
consecrate
his
property
to
the
bishop
of
the
church
without
reserve
with
a
covenant
that
could
not

and
then
from
this
consecrated
property
receive
an

from

sharing
equally
with
his

according
to

and
circumstances
this
inheritance

deeded
d

number

however
had
apostatized
from
the
truth
and
left
the

among

one
ezra
booth
formerly
a
methodist
minister
he
had
been
converted
on
seeing
a
person
healed
of
an
infirmity
of
many
years
standing
and
as
is
so
frequent
in
such
cases
he
required
a
constant
succession
of
miracles
to
keep
him
in
the
church
but
when
as
the
prophet
remarks
in
stating
his
case
he
actually
learned
that
faith
humility
patience
and
tribulation
were
before
blessing
and
that
god
brought
low
before
he
exalted
that
instead
of
the
granting
him
power
to
smite
men
and
make
them
believe
as
he
said
he
wanted
god
to
do
with
him
he
found
he
must
become
all
things
to
all
men
that
he
might
peradventure
save
some
and
that
too
by
all
diligence
by

by

course
the
servants
of
god
must
run
he
was
disappointed
and
turned
away
from

this
by
way
of
introducing
the
matter
the

is
as
related
by
the
prophet
himself
on
the
of
march
the
twins
before
mentioned
which
had
been
sick
of
the
measles
for
some
time
caused
us
to
be
broke
of
our
rest
in
taking
care
of
them
especially
my
wife
in
the
evening
i
told
her
she
had
better
retire
to
rest
with
one
of
the
children
and
i
would
watch
with
the
sickest
child
in
the
night
she
told
me
i
had
better
lie
down
on
the
trundle
bed
and
i
did
so
and
was
soon
after
awakened
by
her
screaming
when
i
found
myself
going
out
of
the
door
in
the
hands
of
about
a
dozen
men
some
of
whose
hands
were
in
my
hair
and
some
hold
of
my
shirt
drawers
and
limbs
the
foot
of
the
trundle
bed
was
towards
the
door
leaving
only
room
enough
for
the
door
to
swing
my
wife
heard
a
gentle
tapping
on
the
windows
which
she
then
took
no
notice
of
but
which
was
unquestionably
designed
for
ascertaining
whether
we
were
all
asleep
and
soon
after
the
mob
burst
open
the
door
and
surrounded
the
bed
in
an
instant
and
as
i
said
the
first
thing
i
knew
i
was
going
out
of
the
door
in
the
hands
of
an
infuriated
mob
i
made
a
desperate
struggle
as
i
was
forced
out
to
extricate
myself
but
only
cleared
one
leg
with
which
i
made
a
pass
at
one
man
and
he
fell
on
the
door
steps
i
was
immediately
confined
again
and
they
swore
by
god
they
would
kill
me
if
i
did
not
be
still
which
quieted
me
as
they
passed
around
the
house
with
me
the
fellow
that
i
kicked
came
to
me
and
thrust
his
hand
into
my
face
all
covered
with
blood
for
i
hit
him
on
the
nose
and
with
an
exulting
hoarse
laugh
muttered
gee
gee
god
damn
ye
i
fix
ye
they
then
seized
me
by
the
throat
and
held
on
till
i
lost
my
breath
after
i
came
to
as
they
passed
along
with
me
about
thirty
rods
from
the
house
i
saw
elder
rigdon
stretched
out
on
the
ground
whither
they
had
dragged
him
by
the
heels
i
supposed
he
was
dead
i
began
to
plead
with
them
saying
you
will
have
mercy
and
spare
my
life
i
hope
to
which
they
replied
god
damn
ye
call
on
yer
god
for
help
we
show
ye
no
mercy
and
the
people
began
to
show
themselves
in
every
direction
one
coming
from
the
orchard
had
a
plank
and
i
expected
they
would
kill
me
and
carry
me
off
on
the
plank
they
then
turned
to
the
right
and
went
on
about
thirty
rods
further
about
sixty
rods
from
the
house
and
thirty
from
where
i
saw
elder
rigdon
into
the
meadow
where
they
stopped
and
one
said

simonds
charged
those
who
had
hold
of
me
to
keep
me
from
touching
the
ground
as
they
had
done
all
the
time
lest
i
should
get
a
spring
upon
them
they
went
and
held
a
council
and
as
i
could
occasionally
overhear
a
word
i
supposed
it
was
to
know
whether
it
was
best
to
kill
me
they
returned
after
awhile
when
i
learned
they
had
concluded
not
to
kill
me
but
pound
and
scratch
me
well
tear
off
my
shirt
and
drawers
and
leave
me
naked

ran
back
and
fetched
the
bucket
of
tar
when
one
exclaimed
god
damn
it
let
us
tar
up
his
mouth
and
they
tried
to
force
the
tar
paddle
into
my
mouth
i
twisted
my
head
around
so
that
they
could
not
and
they
cried
out
god
damn
ye
hold
up
yer
head
and
let
us
give
ye
some
tar
they
then
tried
to
force
a
vial
into
my
mouth
and
broke
it
in
my
teeth
all
my
clothes
were
torn
off
me
except
my
shirt
collar
and
one
man
fell
on
me
and
scratched
my
body
like
a
mad
cat
and
then
muttered
out
god
damn
ye
that
the
way
the
holy
ghost
falls
on
folks
they
then
left
me
and
i
attempted
to
rise
but
fell
again
i
pulled
the
tar
away
from
my
lips
so
that
i
could
breathe
more
freely
and
after
awhile
i
began
to
recover
and
raised
myself
up
when
i
saw
two
lights
i
made
my
way
towards
one
of
them
and
found
it
was
father
johnson
when
i
had
come
to
the
door
i
was
naked
and
the
tar
made
me
look
as
though
i
was
covered
with
blood
and
when
my
wife
saw
me
she
thought
i
was
all
mashed
to
pieces
and
fainted

the
affray
abroad
the
sisters
of
the
neighborhood
had
collected
at
my
room
i
called
for
a
blanket
they
threw
me
one
and
shut
the
door
i
wrapped
it
around
me
and
went
in
my
friends
spent
the
night
in
scraping
and
removing
the
tar
and
washing
and
cleansing
my
body

who
went
up
to
zion
ignored
the
authority
of
the
seven
who
were
placed
there
to
preside
and
began
setting
some
of
the
branches
in
order
without
being
appointed
to
do
so
and
it
resulted
in
some
confusion
others
who
went
there
sought
to
obtain
inheritances
in
some
other
way
than
according
to
the
laws
of
consecration
and
stewardship
and
these
things
together
with
jealousies
covetousness
unbelief
and
general
neglect
to
keep
the
commandments
of
god
enkindled
the
displeasure
of
the
almighty
against
zion
and
her
inhabitants
this
state
of
affairs
coming
to
the
knowledge
of
the
prophet
joseph
through
his
correspondence
with
the
leading
elders
in
zion
he
wrote
a
letter
to
the
saints
in
missouri
severely
reproving
them
for
their
neglect
to
keep
the
commandments
of
god
and
as
the
communication
is
full
of
prophecy
of
those
calamities
which
eventually
befell
the
church
i
quote
it
entire
kirtland
january
wm
phelps
i
send
you
the
olive
leaf
which
we
have
plucked
from
the
tree
of
paradise
the
lord
message
of
peace
to
us
for
though
our
brethren
in
zion
indulge
in
feelings
towards
us
which
are
not
according
to
the
requirements
of
the
new
covenant
yet
we
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
the
lord
approves
of
us
and
has
accepted
us
and
established
his
name
in
kirtland
for
the
salvation
of
the
nations
for
the
lord
will
have
a
place
from
which
his
word
will
go
forth
in
these
last
days
in
purity
for
if
zion
will
not
purify
herself
so
as
to
be
approved
of
in
all
things
in
his
sight
he
will
seek
another
people
for
his
work
will
go
on
until
israel
is
gathered
and
they
who
will
not
hear
his
voice
must
expect
to
feel
his
wrath
let
me
say
unto
you
seek
to
purify
yourselves
and
also
the
inhabitants
of
zion
lest
the
lord
anger
be
kindled
to
fierceness
repent
repent
is
the
voice
of
god
to
zion
and
strange
as
it
may
appear
yet
it
is
true
mankind
will
persist
in
until
all
their
iniquity
is
exposed
and
their
character
past
being
redeemed
and
that
which
is
treasured
up
in
their
hearts
be
exposed
to
the
gaze
of
mankind
i
say
to
you
and
what
i
say
to
you
i
say
to
all
hear
the
warning
voice
of
god
lest
zion
fall
and
the
lord
swear
in
his
wrath
the
inhabitants
of
zion
shall
not
enter
into
my
rest
the
brethren
in
kirtland
pray
for
you
unceasingly
for
knowing
the
terrors
of
the
lord
they
greatly
fear
for
you
you
will
see
that
the
lord
commanded
us
in
kirtland
to
build
a
house
of
god
and
establish
a
school
for
the
prophets
this
is
the
word
of
the
lord
to
us
and
we
must
yea
the
lord
helping
us
we
will
obey
as
on
conditions
of
our
obedience
he
has
promised
us
great
things
yea
even
a
visit
from
the
heavens
to
honor
us
with
his
own
presence
we
greatly
fear
before
the
lord
lest
we
should
fail
of
this
great
honor
which
our
master
proposes
to
confer
upon
us
we
are
seeking
for
humility
and
great
faith
lest
we
be
ashamed
in
his
presence
our
hearts
are
greatly
grieved
at
the
spirit
which
is
breathed
both
in
your
letter
and
that
of
brother
g
the
very
spirit
which
is
wasting
the
strength
of
zion
like
a
pestilence
and
if
it
is
not
detected
and
driven
from
you
it
will
ripen
zion
for
the
threatened
judgments
of
god
remember
god
sees
the
secret
springs
of
human
action
and
knows
the
hearts
of
all
living
brother
suffer
us
to
speak
plainly
for
god
has
respect
for
the
feelings
of
his
saints
and
he
will
not
suffer
them
to
be
tantalized
with
impunity
tell
brother
g
that
low
insinuations
god
hates
but
he
rejoices
in
an
honest
heart
and
knows
better
who
is
guilty
than
he
does
we
send
him
this
warning
voice
and
let
him
fear
greatly
for
himself
lest
a
worse
thing
overtake
him
all
we
can
say
by
way
of
conclusion
is
if
the
fountain
of
our
tears
is
not
dried
up
we
will
still
weep
for
zion
this
from
your
brother
who
trembles
for
zion
and
for
the
wrath
of
heaven
which
awaits
her
if
she
repent
not
joseph
smith
jun
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
crying
peace
when
there
is
no
peace
and
knowing
the
threatened
judgments
of
god
i
say
woe
unto
them
that
are
at
ease
in
zion
fearfulness
will
speedily
lay
hold
of
the
hypocrite
i
did
not
expect
that
you
had
lost
the
commandments
but
thought
from
your
letters
you
had
neglected
to
read
them
otherwise
you
would
not
have
written
as
you
did
it
is
in
vain
to
try
to
hide
a
bad
spirit
from
the
eyes
of
those
who
are
spiritual
for
it
will
show
itself
in
speaking
and
in
writing
as
well
as
in
all
our
other
conduct
it
is
also
needless
to
make
great
pretensions
when
the
heart
is
not
right
the
lord
will
expose
it
to
the
view
of
his
faithful
saints
we
wish
you
to
render
the
as
interesting
as
possible
by
setting
forth
the
rise
progress
and
faith
of
our
church
as
well
as
the
doctrine
for
if
you
do
not
render
it
more
interesting
than
at
present
it
will
fall
and
the
church
suffer
a
great
loss
thereby
a
council
of
high
priests
at
kirtland
also
appointed
hyrum

and
orson

to
write
a
letter
of
reproof
and
warning
in
which

cried

repent

must
suffer
for
the
scourge
and
judgment
must
come
upon
her
the
whole
of
this
communication
however
is
likewise
so
full
of
prophetic
warning
to
the
saints
in
zion
that
i
consider
it
too
important
to
be
omitted
and
hence
give
it
extenso
kirtland
mills
geauga
county
ohio
january
a
conference
of
twelve
high
priests
to
the
bishop
his
council
and
the
inhabitants
of
zion
orson
hyde
and
hyrum
smith
being
appointed
by
the
said
conference
to
write
this
epistle
in
obedience
to
the
commandment
given
the
and
of
september
last
which
says
but
verily
i
say
unto
all
those
to
whom
the
kingdom
has
been
given
from
you
it
must
be
preached
unto
them
that
shall
repent
of
their
former
evil
works
for
they
are
to
be
upbraided
for
their
evil
hearts
of
unbelief
and
your
brethren
in
zion
for
their
rebellion
against
you
at
the
time
i
sent
you
brother
joseph
and
certain
others
have
written
to
you
on
this
subject
but
you
have
never
been
apprized
of
these
things
by
the
united
voice
of
a
conference
of
those
high
priests
that
were
present
at
the
time
this
commandment
was
given
we
therefore
orson
and
hyrum
the
committee
appointed
by
said
conference
to
write
this
epistle
having
received
the
prayers
of
said
conference
that
we
might
be
enabled
to
write
the
mind
and
will
of
god
upon
this
subject
now
take
up
our
pen
to
address
you
in
the
name
of
the
conference
relying
upon
the
arm
of
the
great
head
of
the
church
in
the
commandment
alluded
to
the
children
of
zion
were
all
yea
even
every
one
under
condemnation
and
were
to
remain
in
that
state
until
they
repented
and
remembered
the
new
covenant
even
the
book
of
mormon
and
the
former
commandments
which
the
lord
had
given
them
not
only
to
say
but
to
do
them
and
bring
forth
fruit
meet
for
the
father
kingdom
otherwise
there
remaineth
a
scourge
and
a
judgment
to
be
poured
out
upon
the
children
of
zion
for
shall
the
children
of
the
kingdom
pollute
the
holy
land
i
say
unto
you
nay
the
answers
received
from
those
letters
which
have
been
sent
to
you
upon
this
subject
have
failed
to
bring
to
us
that
satisfactory
confession
and
acknowledgment
which
the
spirit
of
our
master
requires
we
therefore
feeling
a
deep
interest
for
zion
and
knowing
the
judgments
of
god
that
will
come
upon
her
except
she
repent
resort
to
these
last
and
most
effectual
means
in
our
power
to
bring
her
to
a
sense
of
her
standing
before
the
most
high
at
the
time
joseph
sidney
and
newel
left
zion
all
matters
of
hardness
and
misunderstanding
were
settled
and
buried
as
they
supposed
and
you
gave
them
the
hand
of
fellowship
but
afterwards
you
brought
up
all
these
things
again
in
a
censorious
spirit
accusing
brother
joseph
in
rather
an
indirect
way
of
seeking
after
monarchial
power
and
authority
this
came
to
us
in
brother
letter
of
july
we
are
sensible
that
this
is
not
the
thing
brother
joseph
is
seeking
after
but
to
magnify
the
high
office
and
calling
whereunto
he
has
been
called
and
appointed
by
the
command
of
god
and
the
united
voice
of
this
church
it
might
not
be
amiss
for
you
to
call
to
mind
the
circumstances
of
the
nephites
and
the
children
of
israel
rising
up
against
their
prophets
and
accusing
them
of
seeking
after
kingly
power
and
see
what
befell
them
and
take
warning
before
it
is
too
late
brother
gilbert
letter
of
december
has
been
received
and
read
attentively
and
the
low
dark
and
blind
insinuations
which
were
in
it
were
not
received
by
us
as
from
the
fountain
of
light
though
his
claims
and
pretensions
to
holiness
were
great
we
are
not
unwilling
to
be
chastened
or
rebuked
for
our
faults
but
we
want
to
receive
it
in
language
that
we
can
understand
as
nathan
said
to
david
thou
art
the
man
we
are
aware
that
brother
g
is
doing
much
and
has
a
multitude
of
business
on
hand
but
let
him
purge
out
all
the
old
leaven
and
do
his
business
in
the
spirit
of
the
lord
and
then
the
lord
will
bless
him
otherwise
the
frown
of
the
lord
will
remain
upon
him
there
is
manifestly
an
uneasiness
in
brother
gilbert
and
a
fearfulness
that
god
will
not
provide
for
his
saints
in
these
last
days
and
these
fears
lead
him
on
to
covetousness
this
ought
not
to
be
but
let
him
do
just
as
the
lord
has
commanded
him
and
then
the
lord
will
open
his
coffers
and
his
wants
will
be
liberally
supplied
but
if
this
uneasy
covetous
disposition
be
cherished
by
him
the
lord
will
bring
him
to
poverty
shame
and
disgrace
brother
phelps
letter
of
december
is
also
received
and
carefully
read
and
it
betrays
a
lightness
of
spirit
that
ill
becomes
a
man
placed
in
the
important
and
responsible
station
that
he
is
placed
in
if
you
have
fat
beef
and
potatoes
eat
them
in
singleness
of
heart
and
boast
not
yourselves
in
these
things
think
not
brethren
that
we
make
a
man
an
offender
for
a
word
this
is
not
the
case
but
we
want
to
see
a
spirit
in
zion
by
which
the
lord
will
build
it
up
that
is
the
plain
solemn
and
pure
spirit
in
christ
brother
phelps
requested
in
his
last
letter
that
brother
joseph
should
come
to
zion
but
we
say
that
brother
joseph
will
not
settle
in
zion
until
she
repent
and
purify
herself
and
abide
by
the
new
covenant
and
remember
the
commandments
that
have
been
given
her
to
do
them
as
well
as
to
say
them
you
may
think
it
strange
that
we
manifest
no
cheerfulness
of
heart
upon
the
reception
of
your
letter
you
may
think
that
our
minds
are
prejudiced
so
much
that
we
can
see
no
good
that
comes
from
you
but
rest
assured
brethren
that
this
is
not
the
case
we
have
the
best
of
feelings
and
feelings
of
the
greatest
anxiety
for
the
welfare
of
zion
we
feel
more
like
weeping
over
zion
than
rejoicing
over
her
for
we
know
that
the
judgments
of
god
hang
over
her
and
will
fall
upon
her
except
she
repent
and
purify
herself
before
the
lord
and
put
away
from
her
every
foul
spirit
we
now
say
to
zion
this
once
in
the
name
of
the
lord
repent
repent
awake
awake
put
on
thy
beautiful
garments
before
you
are
made
to
feel
the
chastening
rod
of
him
whose
anger
is
kindled
against
you
let
not
satan
tempt
you
to
think
we
want
to
make
you
bow
to
us
to
domineer
over
you
for
god
knows
this
is
not
the
case
our
eyes
are
watered
with
tears
and
our
hearts
are
poured
out
to
god
in
prayer
for
you
that
he
will
spare
you
and
turn
away
his
anger
from
you
there
are
many
things
in
the
last
letters
of
brothers
g
and
p
that
are
good
and
we
esteem
them
much
the
idea
of
having
certain
ones
appointed
to
regulate
zion
and
traveling
elders
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
part
of
the
matter
is
something
we
highly
approbate
and
you
will
doubtless
know
before
this
reaches
you
why
william
mclellin
opposed
you
in
this
move
we
fear
there
was
something
in
brother
gilbert
when
he
returned
to
this
place
from
new
york
last
fall
in
relation
to
his
brother
william
that
was
not
right
for
brother
gilbert
was
asked
two
or
three
times
about
his
brother
william
but
gave
evasive
answers
and
at
the
same
time
he
knew
that
william
was
in
cleveland
but
the
lord
has
taken
him
we
merely
mention
this
that
all
may
take
warning
to
work
in
the
light
for
god
will
bring
every
secret
thing
to
light
we
now
close
our
epistle
by
saying
unto
you
the
lord
has
commanded
us
to
purify
ourselves
to
wash
our
hands
and
our
feet
that
he
may
testify
to
his
father
and
our
father
to
his
god
and
our
god
that
we
are
clean
from
the
blood
of
this
generation
and
before
we
could
wash
our
hands
and
our
feet
we
were
constrained
to
write
this
letter
therefore
with
the
feelings
of
inexpressible
anxiety
for
your
welfare
we
say
again
repent
repent
or
zion
must
suffer
for
the
scourge
and
judgment
must
come
upon
her
let
the
bishop
read
this
to
the
elders
that
they
may
warn
the
members
of
the
scourge
that
is
coming
except
they
repent
tell
them
to
read
the
book
of
mormon
and
obey
it
read
the
commandments
that
are
printed
and
obey
them
yea
humble
yourselves
under
the
mighty
hand
of
god
that
peradventure
he
may
turn
away
his
anger
from
you
tell
them
that
they
have
not
come
up
to
zion
to
sit
down
in
idleness
neglecting
the
things
of
god
but
they
are
to
be
diligent
and
faithful
in
obeying
the
new
covenant
there
is
one
clause
in
brother
joseph
letter
which
you
may
not
understand
that
is
this
if
the
people
of
zion
did
not
repent
the
lord
would
seek
another
place
and
another
people
zion
is
the
place
where
the
temple
will
be
built
and
the
people
gathered
but
all
people
upon
that
holy
land
being
under
condemnation
the
lord
will
cut
them
off
if
they
repent
not
and
bring
another
race
upon
it
that
will
serve
him
the
lord
will
seek
another
place
to
bring
forth
and
prepare
his
word
to
go
forth
to
the
nations
and
as
we
said
before
so
we
say
again
brother
joseph
will
not
settle
in
zion
except
she
repent
and
serve
god
and
obey
the
new
covenant
with
this
explanation
the
conference
sanctions
brother
joseph
letter
brethren
the
conference
meets
again
this
evening
to
hear
this
letter
read
and
if
it
meets
their
minds
we
are
all
agreed
to
kneel
down
before
the
lord
and
cry
unto
him
with
all
our
hearts
that
this
epistle
and
brother
joseph
and
the
revelations
also
may
have
their
desired
effect
and
accomplish
the
thing
whereunto
they
are
sent
and
that
they
may
stimulate
you
to
cleanse
zion
that
she
mourn
not
therefore
when
you
get
this
know
ye
that
a
conference
of
twelve
high
priests
have
cried
unto
the
lord
for
you
and
are
still
crying
saying
spare
thy
people
o
lord
and
give
not
thy
heritage
to
reproach
we
now
feel
that
our
garments
are
clean
from
you
and
all
men
when
we
have
washed
our
feet
and
hands
according
to
the
commandment
we
have
written
plain
at
this
time
but
we
believe
not
harsh
plainness
is
what
the
lord
requires
and
we
should
not
feel
ourselves
clear
unless
we
had
done
so
and
if
the
things
we
have
told
you
be
not
attended
to
you
will
not
long
have
occasion
to
say
or
to
think
rather
that
we
may
be
wrong
in
what
we
have
stated
your
unworthy
brethren
are
determined
to
pray
unto
the
lord
for
zion
as
long
as
we
can
shed
the
sympathetic
tear
or
feel
any
spirit
to
supplicate
a
throne
of
grace
in
her
behalf
the
school
of
the
prophets
will
commence
if
the
lord
will
in
two
or
three
days
it
is
a
general
time
of
health
with
us
the
cause
of
god
seems
to
be
rapidly
advancing
in
the
eastern
country
the
gifts
are
beginning
to
break
forth
so
as
to
astonish
the
world
and
even
believers
marvel
at
the
power
and
goodness
of
god
thanks
be
rendered
to
his
holy
name
for
what
he
is
doing
we
are
your
unworthy
brethren
in
the
lord
and
may
the
lord
help
us
all
to
do
his
will
that
we
may
at

be
saved

us
with

this

these
words
of
reproof
and
warning
had
the
effect
of
awakening
in
the
hearts
of
the
saints
the
spirit
of
repentance
a
solemn
assembly
was
called
at
which
a
sincere
and
humble
repentance
was

a
general
epistle
to
the

authorities
in

bearing
date
of
of
february
was
adopted
at
a
conference
of
the
saints
in
zion
expressing
their
repentance
and
desires
to
keep
the
commandments
of
god
in
the
future
this
was
satisfactory
to
the
brethren
in
kirtland
and
the
lord
said
in
a
revelation
given
the
of
march
that
the
brethren
in
zion
began
to
repent
and
that
the
angels
rejoiced
over
them
still
there
were
many
things
with
which
the
lord
was
not
well
pleased
and
he
said
that
he
would
contend
with

plead
with
her
strong
ones

her

this
occurred
on
the
of
april
and
was
the
first
attempt
of
the
church
to
celebrate
the
anniversary
of
her
birthday
only
three
years
before
in
the
house
of
peter
whitmer
the
church
had
been
organized
and
now
the
saints
in
missouri
were
exclaiming
how
the
church
has
grown
how
much
has
been
accomplished
the
gospel
had
been
preached
in
nearly
all
the
states
of
the
union
thousands
had
hailed
the
message
with
delight
and
numerous
branches
of
the
church
had
been
established
the
place
of
the
city
of
zion
had
been
revealed
and
nearly
a
thousand
of
the
saints
gathered
there
a
printing
establishment
had
been
founded
and
the
precious
truths
from
heaven
were
being
published
to
the
world
and
all
this
had
been
accomplished
in
the
face
of
poverty
and
bitter
opposition
footnote
a
job
during
the
summer
of
a
school
for
the
elders
was
organized
in
zion
presided
over
by
elder
parley
pratt
who
labored
with
all
the
zeal
of
an
apostle
in
teaching
them
the
things
of
god
they
held
their
meetings
in
the
shady
groves
in
god
first
temples
and
their
instructor
frequently
walked
several
miles
to
meet
with
them
how
strange
it
seems
to
record
the
above
as
occurring
in
this
age
it
appears
to
be
quite
out
of
joint
with
the
times
and
smacks
rather
of
that
age
in
which
john
the
baptist
preached
the
gospel
in
the
wilderness
of
judea
clothed
with
camel
hair
and
a
girdle
of
skin
about
his
loins
and
whose
food
was
locusts
and
wild
honey
some
day
however
when
a
parallel
shall
be
drawn
between
the
introduction
of
the
gospel
in
this
dispensation
and
that
in
which
john
figured
it
will
appear
that
the
men
who
have
been
chosen
of
the
lord
in
this
age
to
perform
his
work
possess
the
same
simplicity
of
character
as
those
whom
he
chose
in
judea
nineteen
hundred
years
ago
the
same
guileless
honesty
of
purpose
the
same
confidence
in
god
and
the
same
unwavering
fidelity
to
their
master
cause
as
willing
to
undergo
privations
hunger
and
cold
and
toil
and
nakedness
as
willing
to
endure
the
scorn
and
hatred
of
the
world
as
willing
to
suffer
bonds
and
even
death
the
migration
of
the
saints
to
missouri
in
the
early
summer
of
exceeded
that
of
the
previous
season
but
they
were
settling
among
a
people
who
possessed
characteristics
with
which
from
the
nature
of
things
they
were
bound
to
be
at
variance
the
old
settlers
of
jackson
county
were
principally
from
the
mountainous
portions
of
the
southern
states
they
had
settled
along
the
in
the
forests
which
lined
their
banks
instead
of
out
on
the
broad
and
fertile
prairies
which
only
required
fencing
to
prepare
them
for
cultivation
it
was
the
work
of
years
to
clear
a
few
acres
of
the
timber
lands
and
prepare
them
for
cultivation
but
with
these
small
fields
the
old
settlers
were
content
they
had
no
disposition
to
beautify
their
homes
or
even
make
them
convenient
or
comfortable
they
lived
in
their
log
cabins
without
windows
and
very
frequently
without
floors
other
than
the
ground
and
the
dingy
smoked
log
walls
were
unadorned
by
pictures
or
other
ornaments
they
were
uneducated
those
who
could
read
or
write
being
the
exception
and
not
the
rule
and
they
had
an
utter
contempt
for
the
refinements
of
life
it
is
needless
to
add
that
they
were
narrowminded
ferocious
and
jealous
of
those
who
sought
to
obtain
better
homes
and
who
aspired
to
something
better
in
life
than
had
yet
entered
into
the
hearts
of
these
people
there
was
another
element
in
western
missouri
which
did
not
tend
to
the
improvement
of
its
society
western
missouri
at
the
time
of
which
i
write
and
as
before
remarked
was
the
frontier
of
the
united
states
and
therefore
a
place
of
refuge
for
those
who
had
outraged
the
laws
of
society
elsewhere
here
they
were
near
the
boundary
line
of
the
united
states
and
if
pursued
by
the
officers
of
the
law
in
a
few
hours
they
could
cross
the
line
out
of
their
reach
as
the
officers
could
not
operate
outside
of
their
own
nation
these
outcasts
helped
to
give
a
more
desperate
complexion
to
the
already
reckless
population
of
western
missouri
the
saints
could
not
join
the
missourians
in
their
way
of
life
in
profanity
idleness
drunkenness
and
debauchery
they
had
been
commanded
to
keep
the
sabbath
day
holy
to
keep
themselves
unspotted
from
the
sins
of
the
world
the
fact
of
people
having
so
little
in
common
with
each
other
was
of
itself
calculated
to
beget
a
coldness
and
suspicion
which
would
soon
ripen
into
dislike
the
saints
too
had
come
for
the
most
part
from
the
northern
and
new
england
states
and
the
hatred
that
existed
at
that
time
between
the
people
of
the
and
free
states
was
manifested
toward
the
saints
by
their
southern
neighbors
moreover
the
old
settlers
were
dear
lovers
of
office
and
the
honors
and
emoluments
growing
out
of
it
and
they
greatly
feared
that
the
rapidly
increasing
saints
would
soon
outnumber
them
and
that
the
offices
would
be
wrested
from
them
political
jealousy
is
always
cruel
and
unscrupulous
and
is
not
slow
to
find
excuses
for
destroying
the
object
of
its
hatred
to
the
politician
as
well
as
to
the
lover
trifles
light
as
air
are
to
the
jealous
confirmations
strong
as
proofs
of
holy
writ
and
where
these
trifles
do
not
exist
we
shall
see
in
the
progress
of
our
narrative
that
sectarian
meanness
and
political
jealousy
do
not
hesitate
to
manufacture
them
as
early
as
the
spring
of
there
began
to
appear
signs
of
an
approaching
storm
in
the
deadly
hours
of
the
night
the
houses
of
some
of
the
saints
were
stoned
the
windows
broken
and
the
inmates
disturbed
in
the
fall
of
the
same
year
a
large
quantity
of
hay
in
the
stack
belonging
to
the
saints
was
burned
houses
shot
into
and
the
people
insulted
with
abusive
language
in
the
month
of
april
the
old
settlers
to
the
number
of
some
three
hundred
met
at
independence
to
consult
upon
a
plan
for
the
destruction
or
immediate
removal
of
the
mormons
from
jackson
county
they
were
unable
however
to
unite
on
any
plan
and
the
mob
becoming
the
worse
for
liquor
the
affair
broke
up
in
a
missouri
row
the
secret
of
their
failure
in
accomplishing
anything
was
this
a
few
of
the
brethren
learning
that
such
a
meeting
was
being
held
met
for
secret
prayer
and
petitioned
the
father
to
frustrate
the
plans
of
this
ungodly
mob
who
were
seeking
their
destruction
the
lord
in
view
of
the
fact
doubtless
that
this
people
were
partially
repenting
of
the
evils
for
which
they
had
been
reproved
in
his
mercy
heard
their
prayers
and
thwarted
the
designs
of
their
enemies
but
the
angry
clouds
of
the
threatened
persecution
had
been
merely
drifted
aside
not
driven
from
the
horizon
and
in
a
few
months
they
assumed
a
more
threatening
aspect
than
on
their
first
appearance
the
sectarian
priests
inhabiting
jackson
and
the
surrounding
counties
were
earnestly
engaged
in
fanning
the
flames
of
prejudice
already
burning
in
the
public
mind
the

head
and

of
the

church

this
statement

the

enemies
of
mankind

to
be
destroyed
the
rev
pixley
who
had
been
sent
out
by
the
missionary
society
to
christianize
the
savages
of
the
west
spent
his
time
in
going
from
house
to
house
seeking
to
destroy
the
church
by
spreading
slanderous
falsehoods
to
incite
the
people
to
acts
of
violence
against
the
saints
early
in
july
a
document
was
in
circulation
known
as
the
secret
constitution
setting
forth
the
alleged
grievances
of
the
mob
and
binding
all
who
signed
it
to
assist
in
removing
the
the
document
set
forth
the
following
the
signers
believed
an
important
crisis
was
at
hand
in
their
civil
society
because
a
pretended
religious
sect
the
mormons
had
settled
in
their
midst
the
civil
law
did
not
afford
them
a
sufficient
guarantee
against
the
threatening
evils
and
therefore
they
had
determined
to
rid
themselves
of
the
mormons
peaceably
if
they
could
forcibly
if
they
must
and
for
the
better
accomplishment
of
this
object
they
had
organized
themselves
into
a
company
pledging
to
each
other
their
bodily
powers
their
lives
fortunes
and
sacred
honors
the
saints
are
represented
as
being
the
very
dregs
of
that
society
from
which
they
came
and
also
as
being
poor
idle
lazy
and
vicious
they
are
accused
of
claiming
to
receive
direct
revelation
from
god
to
heal
the
sick
by
the
laying
on
of
hands
to
speak
in
unknown
tongues
by
inspiration
and
in
short
to
perform
all
the
miracles
wrought
by
the
inspired
apostles
and
prophets
of
god
all
of
which
the
document
claims
is
derogatory
of
god
and
religion
and
subversive
of
human
reason
the
signers
of
this
document
also
accuse
the
saints
of
sowing
dissensions
and
inspiring
seditions
among
their
slaves
they
further
charge
that
the
mormons
had
invited
free
people
of
color
to
settle
in
jackson
county
and
state
that
the
introduction
of
such
a
caste
among
their
slaves
would
instigate
them
to
rebel
against
their
masters
and
to
bloodshed
the
mormons
are
also
charged
with
having
openly
declared
that
god
had
given
them
the
land
of
jackson
county
and
that
sooner
or
later
they
would
possess
it
as
an
inheritance
the
document
then
concludes
by
saying
that
if
after
timely
warning
and
receiving
an
adequate
compensation
for
what
property
they
could
not
take
with
them
the
saints
shall
refuse
to
leave
the
county
such
means
as
might
be
necessary
to
remove
them
were
to
be
employed
and
calls
a
meeting
of
the
signers
to
convene
at
the
in
independence
on
the
twentieth
of
july
to
consult
on
subsequent
movements
b
footnote
b
the
document
of
which
the
foregoing
is
a
summary
was
published
in
the
december
number
of
the
evening
and
morning
star
it
may
not
be
amiss
here
to
notice
the
charges
made
against
the
saints
the
statement
made
by
the
mob
that
the
civil
law
did
not
afford
them
a
sufficient
guarantee
against
the
threatening
evils
of
which
they
complained
is
good
evidence
that
the
saints
although
they
may
have
fallen
far
short
of
coming
up
to
the
full
requirements
of
the
high
moral
and
spiritual
laws
of
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
had
violated
none
of
the
laws
of
man
it
is
an
acknowledgement
that
they
lived
above
that
law
as
to
the
saints
being
the
dregs
of
the
society
from
which
they
came
it
is
untrue
they
had
a
respectable
standing
in
the
society
from
which
they
came
and
that
society
was
far
in
advance
in
civilization
and
enlightenment
of
the
people
of
western
missouri
this
is
an
old
and
oft
repeated
charge
against
the
early
members
of
the
church
this
charge
that
they
were
of
the
dregs
of
the
society
from
which
they
came
and
i
repeat
again
that
it
is
not
true
i
know
the
usual
method
of
defense
is
to
concede
the
charge
and
then
quote
the
and
i
may
add
also
the
passage
from
paul
writings
where
in
speaking
of
the
early
christians
he
says
for
ye
see
your
calling
brethren
how
that
not
many
wise
men

to

it

not

who
first
embraced

counts
for

in

they
were

in

it
is
of

that
they
were

for

nothing
about
their
not
being
regarded
as
constituting

having
neither
the
leisure
nor
the
means
to
cultivate
the
special
graces
supposed
to
go

gentlemen
and

characteristics

exist
quite
apart
from
all
that
man
considers
essential
to
entitle
certain
of
their
to
be
considered
as
forming
good

these

the

and
a
host
of
others
whose
names
do
not
appear
so
prominently
in
the
very
early
history
of
the
church
were
a
class
of
people
of
whom
both
the
church
and
god
might
well
be
proud
so
far
removed
were
they
from
being
the
dregs
of
society
that
they
were
the
very
choicest
part
of
it
respected
and
honored
because
possessed
of
those
cardinal
virtues
which
always
command
respect
however
fallen
the
material
fortunes
or
humble

station

calling
of
those
who
possess
them
nor
is
this
general
statement
concerning
the
respectability
of
the
early
members
of
the
church
to
be
weakened
because
some
of
them
were
unhappily
overcome
of
the
world

flesh
and
the
devil
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
all
who
start
in
the
way
of
salvation
will
be
equal
to
the
task
of
persevering
to
the
end
the
inherent
weakness
of
human
nature
forbids
us
to
hope
for
that
the
innate
weakness
of
many
of
the
saints
was
made
apparent

gospel
is
calculated
to
do
that
if
men
come
unto
me
i
will
show
them
their
weakness
d
is
the
word
of
the
lord
in
the
book
of
mormon
and
indeed
it
is
that
if
men
are
to
be
perfected
and
that
is
the
mission
of
the
gospel
then
it
is
necessary
that
their
defects
be
pointed
out
to
them
for
the
first
step
in
reformation
is
to
learn
in
what
particular
direction
reformation
is
needed
all
that
can
be
said
then
against
some
of
the
early
saints
of
this
dispensation
is
that
they
manifested
some
of
the
sinfulness
common
to
humanity
and
much
of
that
weakness
which
is
the
heritage
of
the
sons
of
adam
and
some
of
them
many
of
them
if
you
will
were
not
quite
equal
to
the
great
task
of
overcoming
that
sinful
nature
that
human
frailty
meantime
their
future
is
in
the
hands

this
address
was
unanimously
adopted
by
the
meeting
and
a
committee
of
twelve
appointed
to
wait
upon
the
mormon
leaders
and
see
that
the
foregoing
requisitions
were
assented
to
by
them
in
case
of
a
refusal
on
the
part
of
the
mormons
to
comply
with
these
demands
the
committee
acting
as
the
organ
of
jackson
county
were
to
inform
them
that
it
was
the
fixed
determination
of
the
mob
to
adopt
such
means
as
would
enforce
their
removal
the
committee
called
upon
edward
partridge
gilbert
john
corrill
isaac
morley
john
whitmer
and
phelps
and
demanded
that
they
cease
publishing
the
and
close
the
printing
office
and
that
as
elders
of
the
mormon
church
they
agree
to
move
out
of
the
county
forthwith
three
months
was
asked
for
by
these
elders
in
which
to
consider
the
proposition
and
to
give
them
time
to
counsel
with
the
church
authorities
in
ohio
as
closing
a
printing
office
and
removing
twelve
hundred
people
from
their
homes
was
a
work
of
no
small
moment
but
this
time
was
denied
them
they
asked
for
ten
days
but
that
was
not
granted
fifteen
minutes
only
was
allowed
them
in
which
to
decide
at
this
the
conference
broke
up
and
the
mob
returned
to
the
courthouse
and
reported
to
the
meeting
that
they
had
called
upon
the
mormon
leaders
and
that
they
refused
to
give
a
direct
answer
but
asked
for
time
to
consider
the
propositions
and
counsel
with
their
brethren
in
ohio
the
meeting
then
resolved
that
the
printing
office
be
razed
to
the
ground
and
the
type
and
press
destroyed
with
demoniac
yells
the
mob
surrounded
the
printing
office
and
house
of
phelps
phelps
with
a
sick
infant
in
her
arms
and
the
rest
of
the
children
were
forced
out
of
their
home
the
furniture
was
thrown
into
the
street
and
garden
the
press
was
broken
the
type
pied
the
revelations
and
papers
were
nearly
all
destroyed
or
kept
by
the
mob
and
the
printing
office
and
house
of
phelps
were
razed
to
the
ground
having
reduced
these
buildings
to
a
mass
of
ruins
the
mob
proceeded
to
demolish
the
mercantile
establishment
of
gilbert
whitney
and
destroy
the
goods
but
when
gilbert
assured
them
that
the
goods
would
be
packed
by
the
they
desisted
from
their
work
of
destruction
but
their
fiendish
hate
had
not
spent
its
force
with
horrible
yells
and
cursings
loud
they
sought
for
the
leading
elders
men
women
and
children
ran
in
all
directions
not
knowing
what
would
befall
them
the
mob
caught
bishop
edward
partridge
and
charles
allen
and
dragged
them
through
the
maddened
crowd
which
insulted
and
abused
them
along
the
road
to
the
public
square
here
two
alternatives
were
presented
them
either
they
must
renounce
their
faith
in
the
book
of
mormon
or
leave
the
county
the
book
of
mormon
they
would
not
deny
nor
consent
to
leave
the
county
bishop
partridge
being
permitted
to
speak
said
that
the
saints
had
to
suffer
persecution
in
all
ages
of
the
world
and
that
he
was
willing
to
suffer
for
the
sake
of
christ
as
the
saints
in
former
ages
had
done
that
he
had
done
nothing
which
ought
to
offend
anyone
and
that
if
they
abused
him
they
would
injure
an
innocent
man
here
his
voice
was
drowned
by
the
tumult
of
the
crowd
many
of
whom
were
shouting
call
upon
your
god
to
deliver
you
pretty
jesus
you
worship
these
expressions
intermingled
as
they
were
with
the
vile
oaths
of
the
mob
were
enough
to
put
hell
itself
to
shame
the
two
brethren
partridge
and
allen
were
stripped
of
their
outer
clothing
and
daubed
with
tar
mixed
with
lime
or
pearlash
or
some
other
acid
and
a
quantity
of
feathers
scattered
over
them
they
bore
this
cruel
indignity
and
abuse
with
so
much
resignation
and
meekness
that
the
crowd
grew
still
and
appeared
astonished
at
what
they
witnessed
the
brethren
were
permitted
to
retire
in
silence
in
silence
except
when
it
was
broken
by
the
voice
of
a
sister
crying
aloud
while
you
who
have
done
this
wicked
deed
must
suffer
the
vengeance
of
god
they
having
endured
persecution
rejoice
for
henceforth
for
them
is
laid
up
a
crown
eternal
in
the
heavens
by
this
time
it
was
getting
late
and
the
mob
suddenly
dispersed
as
night
drew
her
sable
mantle
over
the
scene
of
ruin
those
who
had
escaped
to
the
woods
and
corn
fields
began
to
return
to
learn
what
had
befallen
their
friends
wives
anxiously
inquired
of
the
fate
of
their
husbands
and
children
of
the
fate
of
their
parents
there
can
be
nothing
more
sad
than
this
seeking
to
remove
uncertainty
in
such
cases
it
is
like
seeking
the
dead
and
wounded
on
the
battlefield
or
the
missing
the
maimed
or
the
dead
after
an
earthquake
or
some
devouring
tempest
or
flood
so
much
alike
at
least
in
their
results
are
the
eruptions
of
the
elements
and
the
fierce
uncontrolled
passions
of
man
before
each
the
timid
and
the
helpless
fly
to
such
shelter
as
they
find
at
hand
some
seek
safety
in
flight
others
in
hiding
from
the
storm
or
from
wrath
then
when
temporary
safety
is
seemingly
assured
thoughts
for
the
safety
of
others
assert
themselves
the
desire
for
the
safety
of
the
loved
ones
a
wife
a
husband
a
child
a
parent
a
brother
a
friend
becomes
an
agony
love
by
degrees
conquers
fear
and
at
last
prompts
the
facing
of
danger
much
greater
than
those
from
which
at
first
they
fled
and
the
loved
ones
are
sought
despite
of
all
risks
to
personal
safety
so
it
was
with
the
saints
who
had
been
so
unexpectedly
assailed
on
this
occasion
however
those
returning
from
flight
or
hiding
had
nothing
to
discover
beyond
the
destruction
of
the
printing
press
the
wrecking
of
the
phelps
home
the
looting
of
gilbert
store
and
the
abuse
of
partridge
and
allen
enough
surely
for
one
day
of
persecution
but
not
to
be
compared
with
scenes
they
yet
would
witness
the
outrages
of
this
day
were
the
more
reprehensible
because
of
the
character
of
the
leaders
of
the
mob
in
the
main
they
were
the
county
officers
the
county
judge
the
constables
clerks
of
the
court
and
justices
of
the
peace
while
lilburn
boggs
the
the
second
officer
in
the
state
was
there
quietly
looking
on
and
secretly
aiding
every
measure
of
the
mob
who
walking
among
the
ruins
of
the
printing
office
and
house
of
phelps
remarked
to
some
of
the
saints
you
now
know
what
our
jackson
boys
can
do
and
you
must
leave
the
country
chapter
viii
threats
of
the
mob
appeal
of
the
saints
the
third
day
after
the
events
related
in
the
preceding
chapter
the
mob
to
the
number
of
some
five
hundred
again
came
dashing
into
independence
bearing
a
red
flag
and
armed
with
rifles
pistols
dirks
whips
and
clubs
they
rode
in
every
direction
in
search
of
the
leading
elders
making
the
day
hideous
with
their
inhuman
yells
and
wicked
oaths
they
declared
it
to
be
their
intention
to
whip
those
whom
they
captured
with
from
fifty
to
five
hundred
lashes
each
allow
their
negroes
to
destroy
their
crops
and
demolish
their
dwellings
said
they
we
will
rid
jackson
county
of
the
peaceably
if
we
can
forcibly
if
we
must
if
they
will
not
go
without
we
will
whip
and
kill
the
men
we
will
destroy
their
children
ravish
their
women
we
will
ravish
their
women
a
threat
most
horrible
worse
than
murder
for
murder
has
in
it
yet
some
mercy
as
compared
with
ravishment
that
worst
exercise
of
brute
force
against
helpless
innocence
murder
when
it
has
completed
its
work
leaves
its
victim
senseless
and
peaceful
in
death
after
life
fitful
dream
is
over
he
may
sleep
well
but
what
damning
torments
must
that
breast
suffer
which
is
robbed
of
its
peace
by
brutal
force
how
deep
the
woe
that
bears
the
burden
of
an
outraged
modesty
how
agonizing
to
be
an
object
of
pity
how
much
more
cruel
the
living
tortures
of
a
life
so
humiliated
than
the
calmness
and
the
peace
of
death
when
devils
would
with
their
direst
terrors
shake
a
people
they
say
will
ravish
your
women
the
leading
elders
seeing
their
own
lives
and
the
property
and
lives
of
those
over
whom
they
presided
in
jeopardy
resolved
to
offer
themselves
as
a
ransom
for
the
church
willing
to
be
scourged
or
even
put
to
death
if
that
would
satisfy
their
tormentors
and
stop
their
inhuman
cruelties
practiced
toward
the
flock
of
which
the
holy
ghost
had
made
them
overseers
the
men
who
thus
offered
their
own
lives
for
the
lives
of
their
friends
were
john
corrill
john
whitmer
phelps
gilbert
edward
partridge
isaac
morley
forever
let
their
names
be
known
throughout
all
israel
as
men
who
have
given
the
greatest
evidence
within
the
power
of
man
to
give
that
they
loved
the
brethren
greater
love
hath
no
man
than
this
that
a
man
lay
down
his
life
for
his
friends
and
that
faith
which
will
inspire
in
man
a
love
for
his
fellows
that
will
lead
him
to
offer
his
life
as
a
ransom
for
his
brethren
is
so
nearly
akin
to
that
faith
and
love
which
glowed
within
the
breast
of
the
divine
master
that
its
source
can
not
be
mistaken
but
the
inhuman
wretches
who
had
combined
to
drive
the
saints
from
their
homes
in
jackson
county
were
insensible
to
the
sublime
manifestations
of
love
they
witnessed
it
appealed
not
to
their
adamantine
hearts
with
brutal
imprecations
they
told
these
men
that
not
only
they
but
every
man
woman
and
child
would
be
whipped
or
scourged
until
they
consented
to
leave
the
county
as
they
had
decreed
that
the
mormons
should
leave
the
county
or
they
or
the
must
the
presiding
brethren
finding
that
there
was
no
alternative
but
for
them
to
leave
speedily
or
witness
innocent
blood
shed
by
fiends
incarnate

to
leave
jackson

a
new
committee
was
selected
by

to
confer
with

was
entered
into

leading
elders

their
families

all
the

in
their
power
to
stop
any
more
of

moving
into

county
and
also
to
use
their
influence
to
prevent
the
saints
then
enroute
for
missouri
settling
permanently
in
jackson
county
but
for
those
then
on
the
way
they
were
to

permitted
to
make
temporary
arrangements
for
shelter

part

themselves
to

to
ohio
to
confer
with
the
general
church
authorities
on
the
situation
of
the

in

this
conference
resulted
in
the
general
authorities
sending
as
special
messengers
elders
orson
hyde
and
john
gould
to
jackson
county
with
instructions
to
the

not
to
dispose
of

or
other
property
nor
remove
from
the
county
except
those
who
had
signed
the
agreement
to
do
so
meantime
the

attempted
to
settle
in
van
buren
the
county
joining
jackson
on
the
south
the
name
has
since
been
changed
to
cass
but
the
people
of
that
county
after
the
saints
commenced
a
settlement
drew
up
an
agreement
to
drive
them
from
there
and
destroy
the
fruits
of
their
labors
so
they
were
obliged
to
return
to
their
former
homes
while
the
saints
were
making
efforts
to
carry
out
the
first
part
of
the
stipulation
entered
into
with
the
mob
of
jackson
county
the
mob
on
their
part
failed
to
refrain
from
acts
of
violence
daily
the
saints
were
insulted
houses
were
broken
into
and
the
inmate
threatened
with
being
mobbed
if
they
stirred
in
their
defense
but
truth
began
to
make
herself
heard
as
the
fiendish
acts
of
the
mob
became
known
they
called
forth
execrations
from
various
quarters
a
number
of
articles
published
in
the
monitor
printed
at
fayette
howard
county
missouri
censured
the
conduct
of
the
mob
and
suggested
that
the
saints
seek
redress
of
the
state
authorities
for
the
wrongs
they
had
suffered
whereupon
the
leaders
of
the
mob
began
to
threaten
life
and
declared
that
if
any
mormon
attempted
to
seek
redress
by
law
or
otherwise
for
defamation
of
character
or
loss
of
property
he
should
die
these
threats
however
did
not
deter
the
saints
from
appealing
to
the
chief
executive
of
the
state
for
a
redress
of
grievances
a
petition
setting
forth
their
suffering
and
denying
the
allegations
of
the
mob
was
presented
by
orson
hyde
and
phelps
to
daniel
dunklin
who
at
the
time
was
governor
of
the
state
in
addition
to
relating
the
story
of
their
wrongs
and
denying
the
charges
made
by
the
mob
upon
which
the
old
settlers
of
jackson
county
depended
to
excuse
or
defend
their
acts
of
cruelty
toward
the
saints
the
petition
set
forth
that
whenever
that
fatal
hour
arrived
that
the
poorest
citizen
person
property
or
rights
and
privileges
shall
be
trampled
upon
by
lawless
mobs
with
impunity
that
moment
a
dagger
is
plunged
into
the
heart
of
the
constitution
of
the
country
and
the
union
must
tremble
we
solicit
said
they
assistance
to
obtain
our
rights
holding
ourselves
amenable
to
the
laws
of
our
country
whenever
we
transgress
them
they
asked
the
governor
by
express
proclamation
or
otherwise
to
raise
a
sufficient
number
of
troops
who
with
themselves
might
be
empowered
to
defend
their
rights
that
they
might
sue
for
damages
for
the
loss
of
property
for
abuse
for
defamation
of
character
and
if
advisable
try
for
treason
those
who
had
trampled
upon
law
and
government
that
the
law
of
the
land
might
not
be
defied
nor
nullified
but
peace
restored
to
the
country
to
this
very
reasonable
request
governor
dunklin
made
a
patriotic
reply
he
stated
he
would
think
himself
unworthy
the
confidence
with
which
he
had
been
honored
by
his
fellow
citizens
did
he
not
promptly
employ
all
the
means
which
the
constitution
and
laws
had
placed
at
his
disposal
to
avert
the
calamities
with
which
the
saints
were
threatened
and
added
ours
is
a
government
of
laws
to
them
we
all
owe
obedience
and
their
faithful
administration
is
the
best
guarantee
for
the
enjoyment
of
our
rights
no
citizen
nor
number
of
citizens
have
a
right
to
take
the
redress
of
their
grievances
whether
real
or
imaginary
into
their
own
hands
such
conduct
strikes
at
the
very
existence
of
society
and
subverts
the
very
foundation
on
which
it
is
based
i
am
not
willing
to
persuade
myself
that
any
portion
of
the
citizens
of
the
state
of
missouri
are
so
lost
to
a
sense
of
these
truths
as
to
require
the
exercise
of
in
order
to
insure
respect
for
them
he
advised
the
threatened
saints
therefore
to
make
a
trial
of
the
efficacy
of
the
laws
that
wherein
their
lives
had
been
threatened
they
make
affidavit
to
that
effect
before
the
circuit
judge
or
the
justices
of
the
peace
in
their
respective
districts
whose
duty
it
then
became
to
bind
the
threatening
parties
to
keep
the
peace
by
this
experiment
it
would
be
proven
whether
the
laws
could
be
executed
or
not
and
in
the
event
that
they
could
not
be
peacefully
executed
the
governor
pledged
himself
on
being
officially
notified
of
that
fact
to
take
such
steps
as
would
insure
a
favorable
execution
of
them
as
to
the
injuries
the
saints
had
sustained
in
the
loss
of
property
the
governor
advised
them
to
seek
redress
by
civil
process
expressing
the
opinion
that
the
courts
would
grant
them
relief
b

p
i
do
not
doubt
the
sincerity
of
governor
dunklin
in
giving
this
counsel
to
the
saints
and
under
ordinary
circumstances
to
seek
redress
at
the
hands
of
the
civil
authorities
would
be
the
proper
thing
to
do
but
in
this
case
the
officers
of
the
law
had
been
the
head
and
front
of
this
and
infamous
proceeding
in
proof
of
this
statement
i
give
the
names
and
offices
held
by
those
who
were
most
active
in
the
lawless

besides
these
there
were
indian
agents
postmasters
doctors
lawyers
and

these
were
the
men
who
had
despoiled
the
saints
these
the
ones
in
connection
with
the
secret
assistance
of
the
lieutenant
governor
of
the
state
lilburn
boggs
who
inflamed
the
minds
of
the
ignorant
frontier
settlers
against
an
innocent
people
and
encouraged
the
vicious
to
maltreat
the
virtuous
these
were
the
men
who
on
the
of
july
of
the
same
year
had
said
we
will
rid
jackson
county
of
the

if
we
can
forcibly
if
we
must
if
they
will
not
go
without
we
will
whip
and
kill
the
men
we
will
destroy
the
lives
of
their
children
and
ravish
their
women
and
these
were
the
men
the
officers
of
to
whom
the
mormons
were
to
appeal
for
a
redress
of
grievances
to
say
the
least
does
it
not
smack
of
going
to
law
with
the
devil
when
court
is
to
convene
in
hell
surely
it
was
only
a
forlorn
hope
the
saints
could
entertain
of
being
redressed
for
their
wrongs
by
appealing
to
the
very
parties
who
inflicted
those
wrongs
upon
them
and
yet
it
was
about
the
only
course
open
to
the
governor
to
suggest
at
that
time
being
willing
to
magnify
the
law
the
saints
acted
upon
the
advice
for
this
purpose
they
engaged
the
services
of
four
lawyers
from
clay
county
then
attending
court
at
independence
viz
wood
reese
doniphan
and
atchison
these
gentlemen
engaged
to
plant
all
the
suits
the
saints
might
wish
to
present
before
the
courts
and
agreed
to
attend
to
them
jointly
throughout
for
one
thousand
dollars
phelps
and
bishop
partridge
gave
their
notes
for
that
sum
endorsed
by
gilbert
whitney
no
sooner
did
the
mob
witness
these
movements
than
they
began
to
prepare
for
further
hostilities
the
red
right
hand
of
persecution
was
again
armed
to
plague
the
saints
chapter
ix
again
the
storm
having
made
all
necessary
preparations
for
obtaining
by
civil
process
redress
for
the
wrongs
inflicted
upon
them
by
the
mob
sunday
the
twentieth
day
of
october
the
saints
declared
publicly
that
as
a
people
they
intended
to
defend
their
lands
and
homes
the
next
day
the
leaders
of
the
mob
began
to
prepare
to
inflict
further
violence
upon
them
strict
orders
were
circulated
among
the
saints
not
to
be
the
aggressors
but
to
warn
the
mob
not
to
come
upon
them
court
was
to
convene
on
monday
the
of
october
and
it
was
expected
that
some
of
the
leaders
of
the
mob
would
be
required
to
file
bonds
to
keep
the
peace
while
these
preparations
were
progressing
among
the
saints
the
mob
were
not
idle
they
resorted
to
their
old
method
of
circulating
false
rumors
about
the
mormons
the
blasphemy
of
their
doctrines
their
intentions
to
take
possession
of
jackson
county
by
force
the
incompatibility
between
the
old
settlers
and
the
mormons
were
all
urged
and
the
conclusion
reached
that
a
war
of
extermination
must
be
waged
against
the
saints
in
the
name
of
saturday
the
about
fifty
of
the
mob
met
in
counsel
and
voted
to
a
hand
to
move
the
and
as
an
earnest
of
their
intentions
attacked
a
number
of
families
who
had
but
lately
arrived
from
ohio
and
indiana
but
without
inflicting
much
injury
monday
the
the
circuit
court
convened
but
very
few
people
were
in
attendance
there
was
no
mob
there
but
threats
of
the
most
violent
character
were
made
the
night
of
october
however
may
be
regarded
as
the
time
when
hostilities
recommenced
in
earnest
that
night
the
mob
to
the
number
of
forty
or
fifty
proceeded
against
a
branch
of
the
church
located
on
the
stream
called
big
blue
known
as
the
whitmer
settlement
they
shamefully
whipped
nearly
to
death
several
of
the
brethren
among
whom
was
hiram
page
with
brutal
threats
they
frightened
helpless
women
and
children
and
drove
them
into
the
wilderness
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
then
unroofed
and
demolished
ten
or
twelve
houses
this
outrage
was
followed
up
the
next
night
november
by
an
attack
upon
the
saints
living
in
independence
and
vicinity
their
houses
were
brickbatted
doors
broken
down
and
long
poles
thrust
through
their
windows
a
party
of
the
brethren
had
gathered
for
protection
about
half
a
mile
west
of
independence
and
to
them
word
was
sent
that
the
mob
were
tearing
down
the
store
of
gilbert
whitney
and
destroying
their
goods
whereupon
these
brethren
went
in
a
body
to
the
store
at
their
approach
the
main
body
of
the
mob
fled
one
of
their
number
bolder
than
his
fellows
remained
however
and
continued
sending
brickbats
and
stones
through
the
shattered
doors
and
windows
while
the
goods
were
scattered
around
him
in
the
street
this
man
the
brethren
took
prisoner
and
brought
him
immediately
before
samuel
weston
justice
of
the
peace
entered
a
complaint
and
asked
that
a
warrant
be
issued
that
he
richard
mccarty
might
be
secured
but
the
justice
refused
to
make
out
the
warrant
or
do
anything
in
the
matter
and
mccarty
was
turned
loose
the
same
night
an
attack
was
projected
upon
another
branch
of
the
church
known
as
the
colesville
branch
located
in
kaw
township
about
twelve
miles
west
of
independence
the
mob
sent
two
of
their
number
robert
johnson
and
one
harris
as
spies
armed
with
two
guns
and
three
pistols
they
were
discovered
by
some
of
the
brethren
among
whom
was
parley
pratt
without
provocation
johnson
struck
pratt
over
the
head
with
the
breech
of
his
gun
which
staggered
him
for
a
moment
and
made
the
blood
flow
in
streams
down
his
face
these
two
men
were
taken
and
detained
as
prisoners
through
the
night
the
spies
not
returning
rather
disconcerted
the
mob
and
it
is
generally
supposed
prevented
an
attack
that
night
upon
the
colesville
branch
the
morning
following
johnson
and
harris
were
given
their
arms
and
permitted
to
return
to
their
companions
without
receiving
injury
from
the
hands
of
those
whom
they
had
so
maliciously
assaulted
and
into
whose
power
they
had
fallen
on
the
night
of
november
a
party
of
the
mob
went
against
the
branch
located
on
big
blue
unroofed
one
house
and
destroyed
some
furniture
they
also
broke
into
the
house
of
david
bennett
whom
they
found
sick
in
bed
being
unable
to
resist
them
they
beat
him
most
unmercifully
and
swore
they
would
blow
out
his
brains
one
of
their
number
shot
at
him
with
a
pistol
but
the
ball
instead
of
entering
his
head
as
evidently
intended
cut
a
deep
gash
across
the
top
of
it
which
however
did
not
prove
fatal
while
the
mob
were
in
the
act
of
beating
bennett
a
number
of
the
brethren
who
had
gathered
in
a
body
for
mutual
protection
came
upon
the
scene
and
a
firing
of
guns
commenced
both
parties
claim
that
the
other
began
the
attack
but
which
party
began
the
firing
does
not
matter
here
if
the
brethren
opened
the
fire
they
were
altogether
justified
in
doing
so
under
the
circumstances
women
and
children
were
running
here
and
there
screaming
with
terror
not
knowing
where
to
go
for
safety
their
piteous
cries
mingled
with
the
brutal
oaths
of
the
mob
and
the
firing
of
guns
made
the
night
hideous
in
the
melee
a
young
man
acting
with
the
mob
was
shot
through
the
thigh
but
by
which
party
it
is
not
known
this
day
also
the
saints
in
independence
gathered
in
a
body
as
much
as
possible
about
half
a
mile
west
of
the
town
for
the
purpose
of
better
defending
themselves
against
their
enemies
the
day
following
the
events
just
detailed
joshua
lewis
hiram
page
and
two
others
were
despatched
to
lexington
to
see
john
ryland
judge
of
the
circuit
court
and
obtain
a
peace
warrant
the
saints
had
previously
applied
to
squire
silvens
for
such
a
warrant
but
he
refused
to
grant
it
they
read
to
him
the
governor
letter
which
directed
them
to
proceed
in
that
manner
but
he
replied
that
he
cared
nothing
for
what
the
governor
said
either
his
fears
of
the
mob
were
greater
than
his
respect
for
the
governor
or
the
law
or
he
was
in
hearty
sympathy
with
the
rioters
judge
ryland
issued
a
peace
warrant
on
the
but
whether
it
ever
reached
the
hands
of
the
county
sheriff
or
not
i
can
not
learn
if
placed
in
his
hands
then
he
refused
to
serve
it
but
the
most
reasonable
conclusion
is
that
in
consequence
of
the
exciting
times
and
unsettled
state
of
affairs
in
jackson
county
it
never
reached
his
hands
chapter
x
the
passively
good
there
were
a
few
of
the
citizens
of
jackson
county
who
did
not
take
part
in
these
shameful
proceedings
against
the
church
they
were
friendly
disposed
towards
the
saints
but
lacked
the
courage
to
speak
out
boldly
in
their
defense
or
take
up
arms
to
protect
suffering
innocence
this
is
often
the
case
with
the
passively
good
with
conservative
citizens
they
have
no
sympathy
with
rioters
or
with
mob
lawlessness
they
are
ready
to
say
that
such
conduct
is
outrageous
and
even
a
menace
to
free
institutions
and
incompatible
with
freedom
but
further
than
this
they
do
not
go
their
conception
of
good
citizenship
does
not
lead
them
to
be
active
in
resisting
aggressions
upon
the
liberties
of
others
especially
when
those
others
are
people
with
whom
they
have
but
little
sympathy
they
seem
not
to
have
learned
that
those
who
would
preserve
their
own
rights
and
freedom
must
insist
upon
the
rights
and
liberty
of
every
man
being
respected
and
assured
it
is
vain
and
especially
in
a
republic
is
it
vain
for
any
man
to
suppose
that
the
freedom
of
any
citizen
or
class
of
citizens
however
humble
or
even
unpopular
they
may
be
can
be
infringed
without
endangering
the
rights
and
freedom
of
all
many
otherwise
good
citizens
of
the
republic
simple
and
fundamental
to
the
preservation
of
rights
and
freedom
as
is
this
principle
seem
so
far
to
fail
in
appreciation
of
it
that
they
stand
by
while
the
rights
of
others
are
invaded
and
sometimes
swept
away
without
making
so
much
as
a
protest
against
the
injustice
they
are
content
if
only
their
own
personal
and
immediate
rights
are
not
directly
assailed
the
result
is
that
an
active
minority
often
in
fact
an
insignificant
part
of
the
community
and
contemptible
of
character
are
permitted
to
perpetrate
outrages
upon
worthy
though
it
may
be
unpopular
citizens
that
bring
disgrace
upon
the
state
and
endanger
liberty
itself
such
was
the
case
in
the
present
instance
with
those
who
were
not
in
sympathy
with
the
mob
and
yet
so
far
were
they
from
standing
up
for
the
rights
of
those
whom
they
confessed
were
unjustly
assailed
that
they
advised
the
saints
to
leave
the
state
immediately
as
the
wounding
of
the
young
man
on
the
night
of
the
had
enraged
the
whole
county
against
them
and
it
was
a
common
expression
among
the
mob
that
monday
the
of
november
would
be
a
bloody
day
chapter
xi
a
bloody
day
early
on
monday
the
mob
took
the
on
big
blue
west
of
independence
which
belonged
to
the
saints
driving
the
owners
away
with
threats
of
violence
from
thence
they
went
to
a
store
about
one
mile
west
of
the
ferry
kept
by
one
wilson
word
was
brought
to
a
branch
of
the
church
located
several
miles
still
further
west
from
the
ferry
that
the
mob
east
of
the
blue
were
destroying
property
and
the
saints
needed
assistance
upon
hearing
this
nineteen
of
the
brethren
volunteered
to
go
to
their
aid
but
on
approaching
wilson
store
they
learned
that
the
mob
were
there
and
that
the
report
of
the
destruction
of
property
east
of
the
blue
was
false
the
company
started
to
return
to
their
homes
but
two
small
boys
passing
on
their
way
to
store
saw
this
company
and
reported
to
the
mob
that
the
mormons
were
on
the
road
west
of
them
at
this
the
mob
which
numbered
between
forty
and
fifty
started
in
pursuit
and
soon
came
in
sight
of
the
company
of
volunteers
which
at
the
enemy
approach
fled
in
all
directions
the
mob
gave
hot
pursuit
hunting
for
the
brethren
through
the
corn
fields
and
even
searching
the
houses
of
the
saints
for
them
at
the
same
time
threatening
the
women
and
children
with
violence
if
they
did
not
tell
where
the
men
were
hiding
they
fed
their
horses
in
christian
corn
field
and
took
him
and
pointed
their
guns
at
him
threatening
his
life
if
he
did
not
tell
them
where
the
brethren
were
two
or
three
of
the
company
who
were
dispersed
by
the
mob
made
their
way
to
the
colesville
branch
of
the
church
which
was
but
about
three
miles
away
a
company
of
thirty
men
was
quickly
formed
and
although
they
were
armed
with
but
seventeen
guns
and
knew
their
enemies
were
more
numerous
than
they
and
better
armed
they
promptly
marched
to
the
assistance
of
their
brethren
they
found
the
mob
hunting
for
their
victims
and
threatening
the
women
and
children
as
the
mob
saw
this
new
company
approaching
some
of
them
shouted
fire
god
damn
ye
fire
and
then
they
themselves
fired
two
or
three
shots
at
the
approaching
company
this
fire
was
promptly
returned
by
a
volley
from
the
brethren
at
which
the
mob
fled
leaving
two
of
their
number
and
some
of
their
horses
dead
on
the
ground
the
two
killed
were
hugh
brazeale
and
thomas

been
known
to
say
with

wounded
his

the
same
day
november
a
most
extraordinary
affair
occurred
at
independence
we
have
already
told
how
a
number
of
the
brethren
caught
richard
mccarty
on
the
night
of
november
in
the
act
of
hurling
stones
and
brickbats
through
the
doors
and
windows
of
gilbert
whitney
store
while
the
goods
calicoes
shawls
cambric
handkerchiefs
were
scattered
around
him
in
the
street
and
how
the
brethren
took
him
before
the
justice
of
the

samuel
weston
and
asked
for
a
warrant
to
be
issued
against
him
and
how
the
justice
refused
to
issue
the
warrant
but
on
this
fourth
day
of
november
richard
mccarty
obtained
a
warrant
from
this
same
justice
of
the
peace
for
the
arrest
of
gilbert
wm
mclellin
isaac
morley
john
corrill
and
three
or
four

charging
them
with
and

brother
corrill
tersely
remarks
although
we
could
not
obtain
a
warrant
against
him
for
breaking
open
the
store
yet
he
had
gotten
one
for
us
for
catching
him
at
it
the
trial
of
these
men
was
in
progress
in
the
courthouse
at
independence
when
the
news
of
the
battle
west
of
the
blue
was
brought
to
town
but
instead
of
being
reported
correctly
it
was
said
that
the
mormons
had
gone
into
wilson
house
and
shot
his
son
this
so
enraged
the
crowd
that
were
in
attendance
at
the
trial
that
a
rush
was
made
for
the
prisoners
to
kill
them
this
however
was
prevented
and
at
the
suggestion
of
samuel
owens
clerk
of
the
county
court
those
on
trial
were
locked
up
in
jail
for
their
own
safety
during
the
night
the
mob
were
busy
collecting
arms
and
ammunition
making
every
preparation
for
a
general
massacre
of
the
saints
the
next
day
the
brethren
who
were
imprisoned
were
frequently
told
of
these
warlike
preparations
during
the
night
and
that
too
by
men
of
note
and
were
further
informed
that
nothing
but
their
leaving
the
county
would
prevent
bloodshed
whereupon
the
brethren
consented
to
leave
the
county
and
furthermore
agreed
to
go
and
consult
with
their
brethren
on
the
subject
of
all
the
members
of

leaving
for
this
purpose
gilbert
morley

were
accompanied
by
the
sheriff
and
two
others
to
the
branch
of
the
church
some
half
a
mile
from
independence
and
there
held
an
interview
with
their

upon
the
subject
of
their
moving
from
the
county
to
which
the
members
of
that
branch
consented
the
sheriff
and
his
prisoners
then
returned
to
the
jail
it
being
about
two
in
the
morning
as
they
approached
the
jail
they
were
halted
by
a
company
of
armed
men
six
or
seven
in
number
the
sheriff
answered
them
giving
his
own
name
and
the
names
of

time
exclaiming

the
party

them
fired
one
or
two
shots
after
them
gilbert
stood
his
ground
and
while
the
sheriff
held
him
several
guns
were
presented
at
him
two
of
the
men
more
desperate
than
the
rest
attempted
to
shoot
him
but
their

missed
fire
seeing
that
they
failed
to
shoot
him

the

of
a
mob
the
morning
of
the
of
november
witnessed
the
people
from
all
parts
of
the
county
crowding
well
armed
into
independence
but
few
knew
of
the
agreement
made
by
the
saints
in
and
about
independence
to
leave
the
county
and
the
presence
of
the
armed
crowds
was
made
the
occasion
of
calling
out
the
militia
this
last
move
was
at
the
instigation
of
lieutenant
governor
boggs
at
least
such
was
the
report
among
the
people
that
day
the
command
of
this
militia
was
given
to
colonel
pitcher
but
the
men
who
had
formerly
been
the
mob
made
up
the
ranks
of
the
militia
and
the
only
difference
between
the
mob
and
the
militia
was
that
the
mob
organized
as
a
militia
were
prepared
to
adopt
more
effective
measures
in
driving
the
saints
from
their
homes
than
before
they
were
so
organized
the
colonels
in
command
pitcher
and
lucas
were
known
as
the
bitter
enemies
of
the
saints
and
their
names
were
attached
to
the
agreement
circulated
in
the
july
previous
to
drive
them
from
the
county
from
such
a
militia
officered
by
such
men
as
pitcher
and
lucas
the
saints
could
hope
for
no
protection
the
branches
of
the
church
west
of
independence
did
not
hear
of
the
agreement
of
the
independence
branch
to
leave
the
county
but
reports
reached
them
that
a
number
of
their
brethren
were
imprisoned
and
that
the
mob
were
determined
to
kill
them
about
a
hundred
of
the
brethren
gathered
from
the
various
branches
and
marched
in
a
body
to
assist
those
in
peril
they
halted
about
a
mile
west
of
independence
to
ascertain
the
situation
of
affairs
learning
that
the
mob
had
not
attacked
the
branch
at
independence
and
that
the
militia
was
called
out
they
concluded
to
quietly
disperse
and
go
to
their
homes
but
they
had
been
seen
on
the
road
and
it
was
reported
that
the
mormons
were
on
the
march
toward
independence
with
the
intention
no
doubt
to
do
mischief
hearing
this
the
militia
under
colonel
pitcher
became
enraged
and
would
only
consent
to
grant
the
people
peace
on
the
condition
of
their
agreeing
to
deliver
up
certain
men
engaged
in
the
battle
the
evening
before
to
be
tried
for
murder
and
surrendering
their
arms
to
this
last
proposition
lyman
wight
who
it
appears
acted
as
the
leader
of
the
body
of
brethren
that
had
marched
to
independence
would
not
consent
unless
colonel
pitcher
would
also
disarm
the
mob
to
this
the
colonel
cheerfully
agreed
and
pledged
his
honor
with
that
of

to
carry
out
his
promise

their

also
gave
up
a
number
of
the
parties
who
were
engaged
the
night

in

these

buren
counties
those
however
who
settled
in
van
buren
were
again
driven
away
as
related
in
a
former
chapter
the
people
in
clay
county
as
a
rule
were
kind
to
the
exiles
thrown
so
unceremoniously
upon
their
hospitality
they
were
permitted
to
occupy
every
vacant
cabin
and
build
others
for
temporary
shelter
some
of
the
sisters
obtained
positions
as
domestics
in
the
households
of
farmers
while
others
taught
school
for
their
acts
of
kindness
the
people
of
clay
county
were
well
repaid
in
labor
performed
by
the
brethren
who
were
by
no
means
idle
nor
of
the
class
who
would
receive
a
gratuity
when
it
was
within
their
power
to
give
its
equivalent
in
honest
toil
but
look
at
the
situation
of
the
saints
in
the
best
possible
light
and
after
all
it
was
a
gloomy
prospect
in
their
scattered
condition
no
regular
discipline
could
be
enforced
many
of
them
were
beyond
the
reach
of
their
spiritual
teachers
and
being
surrounded
by
wickedness
their
hopes
blighted
and
witnessing
the
apparent
triumph
of
the
wicked
is
it
any
wonder
if
in
their
despair
many
of
them
committed
sins
and
were
chargeable
with
follies
unbecoming
people
of
their
profession
but
in
the
main
the
saints
were
immovable
as
the
everlasting
hills
in
their
righteousness
and
in
their
integrity
they
were
willing
to
count
all
things
as
dross
for
the
excellency
of
the
knowledge
of
god
their
very
sufferings
only
wafted
them
nearer
to
him
who
permitted
their
enemies
to
chasten
them
for
their
good
their
very
chastisement
being
a
witness
that
they
were
sons
of
god
that
he
loved
them
a
footnote
a
hebrews
the
brethren
were
perplexed
most
of
all
as
to
what
course
to
pursue
their
return
to
the
lands
from
which
they
had
been
driven
looked
at
least
unlikely
they
knew
not
whether
it
would
be
best
to
lease
or
buy
lands
in
clay
county
whether
to
prepare
for
permanent
or
only
temporary
residence
in
that
land
in
the
midst
of
this
uncertainty
a
conference
was
convened
on
the
of
january
at
the
house
of
pratt
at
which
it
was
that
lyman
wight
and
parley
pratt
be
sent
as
special
messengers
to
represent
the
situation
of
the
scattered
brethren
in
missouri
to
the
presidency
of
the
church
in
kirtland
and
ask
their
advice
accordingly
these
brethren
started
to
perform
this
mission
leaving
their
families
in
a
penniless
condition
while
they
themselves
faced
the
winds
and
snows
of
winter
in
the
interests
of
their
afflicted
pending
the
saints
receiving
instructions
from
their
youthful
prophet
we
have
many
events
to
relate
to
our
readers
in
the
latter
part
of
december
a
court
of
inquiry
was
held
at
liberty
clay
county
to
investigate
the
conduct
of
colonel
pitcher
in
dispossessing
the
mormons
of
their
arms
and
driving
them
from
their
homes
the
inquiry
resulted
in
his
arrest
and
trial
before
a
but
the
court
did
not
convene
until
the
of
february
and
so
remiss
in
the
performance
of
his
duty
was
general
thompson
who
presided
at
the
trial
that
no
report
was
made
to
the
governor
until
the
first
of
may
and
even
then
it
had
to
be
solicited
by
the
governor
from
the
facts
brought
out
in
that
trial
the
governor
decided
that
colonel
pitcher
had
no
right
to
dispossess
the
mormons
of
their
arms
and
sent
an
order
to
lucas
colonel
of
the
regiment
to
deliver
the
arms
taken
from
the
mormons
on
the
of
december
to
phelps
john
corrill
partridge
gilbert
or
their
order
lucas
in
the
meantime
however
had
resigned
his
position
left
jackson
county
and
settled
in
lexington
learning
of
this
the
governor
issued
a
second
order
for
the
arms
directing
it
this
time
to
colonel
pitcher
this
letter
was
inclosed
in
a
letter
from
the
governor
to
phelps
and
sent
to
pitcher
on
the
tenth
of
july
but
the
arms
were
never
returned
indeed
between
the
issuing
of
the
first
and
second
orders
of
the
governor
for
their
restoration
to
their
owners
the
arms
were
distributed
among
the
mob
and
they
insolently
boasted
that
the
arms
should
not
be
returned
notwithstanding
the
order
of
the
executive
the
determination
of
the
mob
proved
to
be
stronger
than
the
authority
of
the
governor
the
of
the
militia
of
the
state
in
the
month
of
december
the
mob
permitted
the
firm
of
davies
kelly
to
take
the
printing
press
owned
by
the
church
over
to
liberty
in
clay
county
where
the
said
firm
began
the
publication
of
missouri
enquirer
and
in
payment
for
the
press
turned
over
to
the
lawyers
employed
by
the
saints
three
hundred
dollars
on
the
one
thousand
dollar
note
the
brethren
had
given
their
attorneys
not
much
to
pay
for
a
press
that
with
the
had
cost
eighteen
months
before
between
three
and
four
thousand
dollars
chapter
xv
an
attempted
vindication
of
law
it
would
appear
that
as
soon
as
the
news
of
the
expulsion
of
the
saints
reached
the
ears
of
the
state
officers
they
were
anxious
to
reinstate
them
in
their
possessions
wells
the
of
missouri
wrote
the
lawyers
employed
by
the
church
to
the
effect
that
if
the
mormons
desired
to
be
returned
to
their
homes
in
jackson
county
an
adequate
force
of
the
state
militia
would
be
sent
forthwith
to
accomplish
this
object
the
militia
have
been
ordered
to
hold
themselves
in
readiness
for
that
purpose
he
also
promised
that
if
the
mormons
would
organize
themselves
into
a
company
of
militia
they
should
be
supplied
with
arms
by
the
state
he
also
suggested
that
as
only
a
certain
quantity
of
public
arms
can
be
distributed
in
each
county
those
who
first
apply
will
be
most
likely
to
receive
them
this
letter
was
written
after
a
conversation
between
the
governor
and
the
and
by
that
conversation
the
believed
that
he
was
warranted
in
making
these
suggestions
to
the
mormons
and
one
would
be
justified
in
regarding
the
foregoing
as
the
sentiments
of
the
governor
as
well
as
the
john
ryland
the
circuit
judge
for
the
district
of
which
jackson
county
was
a
part
wrote
to
amos
reese
circuit
attorney
for
the
same
district
and
also
counsel
for
the
church
saying
that
he
had
been
requested
by
the
governor
to
inform
him
about
the
outrageous
acts
of
unparalleled
violence
that
had
lately
happened
in
jackson
county
and
had
been
requested
by
him
to
examine
into
these
outrages
and
to
take
steps
to
punish
the
guilty
and
screen
the
innocent
he
however
that
is
judge
ryland
could
not
proceed
without
some
person
was
willing
to
give
the
proper
information
before
him
he
asked
the
circuit
attorney
to
find
out
from
the
mormons
if
they
were
willing
to
take
legal
steps
against
the
citizens
of
jackson
county
and
if
they
desired
to
be
reinstated
in
their
possessions
if
so
he
was
willing
to
adopt
measures
looking
toward
the
accomplishment
of
this
object
saying
that
the
military
force
would
repair
to
jackson
county
and
execute
any
order
he
might
make
respecting
the
subject
it
is
a
disgrace
to
the
state
said
he
for
such
acts
to
happen
within
its
limits
and
the
disgrace
will
attach
to
our
official
characters
if
we
neglect
to
take
proper
means
to
ensure
the
punishment
due
such
offenders
the
order
for
an
immediate
court
of
inquiry
had
been
prepared
by
the
governor
but
he
waited
to
hear
from
the
saints
as
to
whether
or
not
they
desired
to
be
reinstated
in
their
homes
the
leading
elders
of
the
church
learning
through
their
attorneys
of
the
steps
taken
to
hold
an
immediate
court
of
inquiry
at
once
wrote
the
governor
asking
him
not
to
hold
an
immediate
court
of
inquiry
as
at
that
time
many
of
those
persons
whom
they
would
want
as
witnesses
were
scattered
through
several
of
the
surrounding
counties
and
could
not
be
notified
in
time
to
be
in
attendance
besides
this
they
urged
that
many
of
their
principal
witnesses
would
be
women
and
children
and
so
long
as
the
rage
of
the
mob
continued
unabated
it
would
be
unsafe
to
take
these
witnesses
to
independence
an
immediate
court
of
inquiry
wrote
gilbert
called
while
our
people
are
thus
situated
would
give
our
enemies
a
decided
advantage
in
point
of
testimony
he
asked
his
excellency
therefore
in
behalf
of
the
church
to
postpone
the
court
of
inquiry
until
the
saints
were
restored
to
their
homes
and
had
an
equal
chance
with
their
enemies
in
producing
testimony
before
the
court
amos
reese
the
circuit
attorney
and
one
of
the
counsel
for
the
church
concurred
in
these
very
reasonable
requests
and
said
further
i
think
that
at
the
next
regular
term
of
the
court
an
examination
of
the
criminal
matter
can
not
be
gone
into
without
a
guard
for
the
court
and
witnesses
the
communication
which
made
these
suggestions
was
followed
up
on
the
of
december
by
a
petition
to
the
governor
which
set
forth
the
outrages
committed
against
the
saints
by
the
jackson
county
mob
as
already
related
in
these
pages
and
asked
him
to
restore
them
to
their
possessions
in
that
county
and
protect
them
when
restored
by
the
militia
of
the
state
if
legal
or
by
a
detachment
of
the
united
states
troops
the
petition
suggested
that
doubtless
the
latter
arrangement
could
be
effected
by
the
governor
conferring
with
the
president
of
the
united
states
on
the
subject
they
also
asked
that
their
men
be
organized
into
companies
of
jackson
guards
and
furnished
with
arms
by
the
state
that
they
might
assist
in
maintaining
their
rights
and
then
said
they
when
arrangements
are
made
to
protect
us
in
our
persons
and
property
which
can
not
be
done
without
an
armed
force
nor
would
it
be
prudent
to
risk
our
lives
there
without
guards
till
we
receive
strength
from
our
friends
to
protect
ourselves
we
wish
a
court
of
inquiry
instituted
to
investigate
the
whole
matter
of
the
mob
against
the
to
this
petition
the
governor
replied
on
the
of
february
and
said
the
request
to
be
restored
to
their
homes
and
lands
needed
no
evidence
to
support
the
right
to
have
it
granted
in
relation
to
the
brethren
organizing
into
military
companies
the
governor
said
should
your
men
organize
according
to
law
which
they
have
a
right
to
do
indeed
it
is
their
duty
to
do
so
unless
exempted
by
religious
scruples
and
apply
for
public
arms
the
executive
could
not
distinguish
between
their
right
to
have
them
and
the
right
of
every
other
description
of
people
similarly
situated
all
these
answers
of
the
governor
to
the
petition
of
the
exiled
saints
so
far
were
good
and
manifested
a
spirit
to
administer
justice
but
when
he
comes
to
consider
their
request
to
be
in
their
possessions
as
well
as
in
them
his
reply
was
not
so
favorable
as
to
the
request
said
he
for
keeping
up
a
military
force
to
protect
your
people
and
prevent
the
commission
of
crimes
and
injuries
were
i
to
comply
it
would
transcend
the
power
with
which
the
executive
of
this
state
is
clothed
still
the
laws
of
the
state
empower
the
in
case
of
actual
or
threatened
invasion
insurrection
or
war
or
public
danger
or
emergency
to
call
forth
into
actual
service
such
portion
of
the
militia
as
he
may
deem
expedient
in
my
judgment
it
does
seem
that
under
the
powers
here
conferred
upon
the
executive
by
this
provision
of
the
fundamental
law
of
the
state
the
constitution
the
governor
could
have
granted
the
request
of
the
saints
to
be
protected
in
their
homes
until
peace
was
restored
surely
the
clause
or
other
emergency
in
the
section
of
the
law
just
quoted
was
broad
enough
to
justify
him
in
protecting
by
the
state
militia
twelve
hundred
citizens
of
the
united
states
in
their
homes
until
mob
violence
had
subsided
until
respect
for
the
civil
law
had
been
restored
and
these
citizens
allowed
to
dwell
in
safety
upon
the
lands
they
had
purchased
from
the
general
government
under
this
provision
he
could
have
curbed
those
cruel
devils
of
their
will
without
doing
even
a
little
wrong
in
order
to
do
a
great
right
without
wresting
the
law
to
his
authority
but
he
chose
to
interpret
the
law
otherwise
as
follows
the
words
or
other
emergency
in
our
militia
law
seem
quite
broad
but
the
emergency
to
come
within
the
object
of
that
provision
shall
be
of
a
public
nature
your
case
is
certainly
a
very
emergent
one
and
the
consequences
as
important
to
as
if
the
war
had
been
waged
against
the
whole
state
yet
the
has
no
other
interest
in
it
than
that
the
laws
be
faithfully
executed
the
sequel
will
show
how
the
laws
were
executed
and
how
the
public
stood
by
indifferent
spectators
while
an
unoffending
people
were
robbed
of
their
possessions
and
the
laws
of
the
state
set
at
defiance
by
insolent
mobs
the
governor
closed
his
answer
to
the
petition
of
the
exiles
by
saying
that
as
then
advised
it
would
be
necessary
to
have
a
military
guard
for
the
court
and
state
witnesses
while
sitting
in
jackson
county
and
he
sent
an
order
to
the
captain
of
the
liberty
blues
to
comply
with
the
requisition
of
the
circuit
attorney
in
protecting
the
court
and
executing
its
orders
during
the
progress
of
the
trials
arising
out
of
the
jackson
county
difficulties
and
said
the
mormons
could
if
they
felt
so
disposed
return
under
the
protection
of
this
guard
to
their
homes
and
be
protected
in
them
during
the
progress
of
the
trials
it
required
no
great
wisdom
however
to
foresee
that
for
the
saints
to
return
to
their
homes
and
then
be
left
there
without
protection
left
to
the
mercy
of
inhuman
wretches
in
whose
veins
ran
none
of
the
milk
of
human
kindness
would
not
be
far
removed
from
suicide
as
the
mob
greatly
outnumbered
the
saints
to
return
under
these
circumstances
would
only
be
laying
the
foundation
for
a
greater
tragedy
than
the
one
already
enacted
and
the
brethren
wisely
concluded
not
to
attempt
to
regain
possession
of
their
homes
until
some
measure
was
adopted
to
protect
them
when
there
until
god
or
the
president
ruled
out
the
mob
at
the
february
term
of
the
circuit
court
which
convened
at
independence
about
twelve
of
the
leading
elders
were
subpoenaed
as
witnesses
on
the
part
of
the
state
against
certain
citizens
of
jackson
county
for
their
acts
of
mob
violence
against
the
mormons
on
the
of
the
month
these
witnesses
crossed
the
missouri
into
jackson
county
under
the
protection
of
the
liberty
blues
captain
atchison
commanding
the
company
numbered
about
fifty
and
were
all
well
armed
with
united
states
muskets
bayonets
fixed
presenting
an
outward
appearance
fair
and
warlike
the
company
and
witnesses
commenced
crossing
the
river
about
noon
but
it
was
nearly
night
before
the
baggage
wagon
was
taken
across
while
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
the
wagon
it
was
decided
to
camp
in
the
woods
and
not
go
to
independence
until
the
next
morning
half
the
company
and
a
number
of
the
witnesses
went
about
half
a
mile
towards
independence
and
built
fires
for
the
night
while
engaged
in
these
duties
the
quartermaster
and
others
who
had
gone
ahead
to
prepare
quarters
in
town
for
the
company
sent
an
express
back
which
was
continued
by
captain
atchison
to
colonel
allen
for
the
two
hundred
drafted
militia
under
his
command
and
also
sent
to
liberty
for
more
ammunition
the
night
was
passed
around
the
camp
fires
as
the
party
was
without
tents
and
the
weather
cold
enough
to
snow
a
little
next
morning
the
witnesses
were
marched
to
independence
under
a
strong
guard
and
quartered
in
the
formerly
the
flourney
hotel
the
of
the
state
wells
had
been
sent
down
by
the
governor
to
assist
the
circuit
attorney
reese
to
investigate
as
far
as
possible
the
jackson
outrage
these
gentlemen
waited
upon
the
witnesses
in
their
quarters
and
gave
them
to
understand
that
all
hope
of
criminal
procedure
against
the
mob
was
at
an
end
only
a
few
minutes
afterward
captain
atchison
informed
the
witnesses
that
he
had
received
an
order
from
judge
ryland
that
the
services
of
his
company
were
no

with
the

of
the

who
had
trembled
before

a

gathered
and
assumed
such
a
boisterous
and
mobocratic
appearance
that
their
bold
front
overawed
the
officers
of
the
court
the
attorneys
of
the
state
telling
the
state
witnesses
who
were
also
sufferers
from
the
previous
violence
of

mob
that
all
hopes
of
criminal
prosecutions
against

at

were

ended
the

made
by

bring

these

one

of

had
conspired
against
the

of
another
class
and
being
the
stronger
had
without
the
authority
of
law
or
shadow
of
justification
driven
twelve
hundred
of
them
from
their
possessions
and
there
was
not
virtue
enough
in
the
executive
of
the
state
and
his
associates
to
punish
the
offenders
the
determination
of
the
mob
to
resist
the
law
was
stronger
than
the
determination
of
the
state
officers
to
execute
it
and
make
it
honorable
and
yet
the
constitution
of
the
state
made
it
the
imperative
duty
of
the
executive
to
take
care
that
the
laws
are
faithfully
executed
and
the
laws
of
the
state
empowered
the
of
the
militia
the
governor
in
case
of
insurrection
or
war
or
public
danger
or
other
emergency
to
call
forth

by

the

in

him
said
verily
i

unto
you
concerning
your

who
have
been
afflicted
and
persecuted
and
cast
out
from

of

i

the
affliction
to
come
upon

wherewith
they
have

in

their
transgressions
behold
i
say
unto
you
there
were
jarrings
and
contentions
and
envyings
and
strifes
and
lustful
and
covetous
desires
among
them
therefore
by
these
things
they
polluted
their
inheritances
they
were
slow
to
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
lord
their
god
therefore
the

true

however
in
another
place
for
us
to
tell
how
unsympathetic
and
what
a
lack
of
faith
there
was
among
the
eastern
branches
of
the
church
and
how
these
things
justly
brought
upon
the
saints
in
the
east
the
displeasure
of
god
and
prevented
at
that
time
the
redemption
of
zion
the
village
of
new
portage
about
fifty
miles
from
kirtland
ohio
was
made
the
place
of
rendezvous
for
the
young
and
brethren
who
in
response
to
the
call
of
the
lord
and
his
prophet
had
volunteered
to
go
to
the
assistance
of
their
brethren
in
missouri
and
here
about
the
first
of
may
the
volunteers
began
to
assemble
on
the
sixth
they
were
joined
by
their
youthful
who
the
next
day
organized
them
as
follows
williams
was
appointed
treasurer
and
of
the
camp
all
the
money
was
collected
and
given
into
his
keeping
zerubbabel
snow
was
appointed
commissary
general
there
were
also
other
general
officers
that
were
appointed
but
what
they
were
we
have
been
unable
to
learn
the
camp
was
divided
into
small
companies
twelve
men
in
each
these
companies
elected
their
own
captains
who
then
assigned
each
man
his
duty
in
the
respective
companies
thus
two
cooks
two
firemen
two
tent
makers
two
watermen
one
runner
or
messenger
two
wagoners
and
horsemen
and
one
commissary
in
all
the
company
that
collected
at
new
portage
numbered
one
hundred
and
fifty
which
was
increased
by
the
time
the
camp
reached
missouri
to
about
two
hundred
they
purchased
flour
and
baked
their
own
bread
and
cooked
their
own
provisions
which
at
times
were
scarce
their
baggage
wagons
about
twenty
in
number
were
so
loaded
with
their
provisions
arms
ammunition
and
clothing
for
their
distressed
brethren
in
missouri
that
nearly
the
whole
company
had
to
walk
every
night
before
retiring
to
sleep
the
blast
of
the
evening
trumpet
called
them
to
prayers
in
their
respective
tents
and
the
morning
trumpet
summoned
them
to
implore
the
assistance
of
divine
providence
in
the
day
march
thus
they
made
the
journey
pitching
their
tents
by
the
alike
in
the
settled
country
and
in
the
wilderness
stopping
occasionally
for
a
few
days
to
refresh
their
overworked
teams
and
always
remaining
in
camp
on
the
sabbath
day
to
hold
divine
service
and
partake
of
the
sacrament
on
the
occasion
of
their
holding
public
worship
the
people
in
the
vicinity
of
their
encampment
would
often
attend
and
wonder
much
at
the
doctrines
they
heard
being
puzzled
to
know
what
sect
of
men
they
were
such
a
company
of
men
traveling
in
this
manner
through
the
country
did
not
fail
to
excite
the
curiosity
of
the
people
and
every
effort
was
made
to
learn
the
names
of
the
leaders
the
business
object
and
destination
of
the
expedition
but
in
this
they
failed
as
it
was
joseph
instructions
to
the
members
of
the
company
not
to
make
these
things
known
there
were
several
boys
in
the
expedition
and
at
times
these
were
questioned
by
strangers
but
with
very
unsatisfactory
results

questioned

not

suspected
they
were

and
many
times
the
little
band
was
threatened
with
destruction
and
spies
continually
harassed
them
by
trying
to
get
into

they
were
foiled
in

though
by
the
vigilance
of
the
guards
who
nightly
patrolled
their

at
various
points
through
indiana
and
illinois
they
were
told
their

would
be

these
threats
nothing
daunted

the
opposition
was
overawed
more
than
once
by
the
numbers
in
the
camp
being
multiplied
in
the
eyes
of
their
enemies
the
brethren
of
zion
camp
knew
the
object
of
the
expedition
to
be
a
noble
one
they
were
conscious
of
god
approval
and
of
the
presence
in
their
midst
of
his
angels
and
strengthened
by
this
knowledge
they
fearlessly
marched
on
to
accomplish
the
work
of
redeeming
zion
joseph

know
that
the
angels
were
our
companions
for
we
saw
them
a
circumstance
in

experience
of
parley

further
testimony
of
the
presence
of
angels
with
this

elder
pratt
was

engaged
as
a

on
one
occasion
when
he
had
traveled
all
night
to
overtake
a
small
company
he
was
conducting
to
the
main
camp
he
stopped
at
noon
on
a
broad
level
plain
to
let
his
horse
feed
no
habitation
was
near
stillness
and
repose
reigned
around
him
i
sank
down
he
says
overpowered
with
a
deep
sleep
and
might
have
lain
in
a
state
of
oblivion
till
the
shades
of
night
had
gathered
about
me
so
completely
was
i
exhausted
for
the
want
of
sleep
and
rest
but
i
had
only
slept
a
few
moments
till
the
horse
had
grazed
sufficiently
when
a
voice
more
loud
and
shrill
than
i
had
ever
before
heard
fell
upon
my
ear
and
thrilled
through
every
part
of
my
system
it
said
it
is
time
to
be
up
and
on
your
journey
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
i
was
perfectly
aroused
i
sprang
to
my
feet
so
suddenly
that
i
could
not
at
first
recollect
where
i
was
or
what
was
before
me
to
perform
i
afterwards
related
the
circumstance
to
brother
joseph
smith
and
he
bore
testimony
that
it
was
the
angel
of
the
lord
who
went
before
the
camp
who
found
me
overpowered
with
sleep
and
thus
awoke
me

received
word
that
the
people
intend
to
prevent
us
crossing
the

river
which
we
will
reach
by
ten
tomorrow
so
that
we
are
in
the

of
our
enemies
if
we
camp
in

woods
they
could
surround
us
and
we
not

by
making
this
eminence
our
camp
ground
they
ca
approach
without
being
observed
by
our

and
the

will
be
willing
to
carry
both
wood
and
water
this
short
distance
in
order
to
enjoy
the
security
of
this
position
and
now
the

has
come
in

has
been

to
say
that
the
spirit
of
union
and
harmony
depicted
in
my
pen
sketch
of
the
camp
in
the
of
chapter
eighteen
was
not
always
characteristic
of
it
there
were
times
when
a
spirit
of
selfishness
and
an
utter
lack
of
brotherly
love
with
some
was
manifested
particularly
was
this
true
of
one
sylvester
smith
who
exhibited
a
selfish
and
at
other
times
a
quarrelsome
spirit
one
evening
when
provisions
in
camp
were
scarce
elder
pratt
called
upon
sylvester
smith
for
something
to
eat
and
although
smith
had
food
he
refused
to
divide
with
brother
pratt
and
sent
him
to
someone
else
the
end
of
it
was
brother
pratt
had
to
retire
hungry
joseph
being
told
of
this
severely
reproved
the
offender
and
whether
that
reproof
continued
to
gall
the
feelings
of
sylvester
smith
or
not
i
can
not
say

at
any

as
soon
as

joseph
decided
that
it
would
be

move
out
into

with
this
arrangement
some
were

lyman

turned
aside
with

and
went

came
along
would
hail

ask

and
then
drove
out
to
the
plain
where
the
ensign
had
been
planted
to
mark
the
place
joseph
had
chosen
for
the
encampment
those
who
had
turned
aside
and
made
an
effort
to
divide
the
camp
came
up
also
and
were
called
upon
to
give
an
account
of
their
conduct
they
acknowledged
their
error
and
were
forgiven
another
difficulty
arose
among
the
brethren
about
a
dog
which
had
snapped
at
sylvester
smith
and
others
considerable
anger
and
ill
feeling
existed
in
camp
about
it
at
last
joseph
in
the
presence
of
a
number
of
the
brethren
said
i
will
descend
to
that
spirit
which
is
in
the
camp
to
show
you
the
spirit
you
are
of
for
i
want
to
drive
it
from
the
camp
man
that
kills
that
dog
i
will
whip
him
sylvester
smith
came
up
just
in
time
to
hear
the
last
part
of
remarks
and
said
if
that
dog
bites
me
i
shall
kill
him
if
you
do
i
will
whip
you
replied
joseph
if
you
do
i
shall
defend
myself
the
best
way
that
i
can
to
which
joseph
rejoined
that
he
would
whip
him
in
the
name
of
the
lord
now
said
he
i
have
descended
to
that
spirit
to
show
you
the
spirit
which
is
among
you
brethren
are
you
not
ashamed
of
it
i
am
then
he
reproved
them
sharply
for
their
murmuring
and
follies
as
they
continued
in
their
rebellious
moods
and
manifested
but
little
of
the
spirit
of
repentance
he
predicted
that
a
plague
would
overtake
the
camp
and
they
would
die
like
sheep
with
the
rot
a
of
the
fulfillment
of
this
prediction
i
shall
speak
hereafter

while
we
were

ourselves
and
our
teams
about
the
middle
of

brother
joseph
got
up
in
a
wagon
and
said
that
he
would
deliver
a
prophecy
after
giving
the
brethren
much
good
advice
exhorting
them
to
faithfulness
and
humility
he
said
the
lord
had
told
him
that
there
would
be
a
scourge
come
upon
the
camp
in
consequence
of
the
factions
and
unruly
spirits
that
appeared
among
them
and
they
should
die
like
sheep
with
the
rot
still
if
they
would
repent
and
humble
themselves
before
the
lord
the
scourge
in
a
great
measure
might
be

as
soon
as
the

was
reorganized
at
salt
river
parley
pratt
and
orson
hyde
were
sent
as
delegates
to
wait
upon
governor
dunklin
at
jefferson
city
and
request
him
to
call
out
a
sufficient
military
force
to
reinstate
the
saints
in
the
possession
of
their
homes
in
the
interview
the
governor
frankly
admitted
the
justice
of
the
demand
but
expressed
fears
that
if
he
should
so
proceed
it
would
excite
civil
war
and
deluge
the
whole
country
with
blood
he
advised
these
delegates
to
counsel
their
people
for
the
sake
of
peace
to
sell
the
lands
from
which
they
had
been
driven
to
this
the
delegates
refused
to
consent
saying
we
will
hold
no
terms
with
land
pirates
and
murderers
if
we
are
not
permitted
to
live
on
the
lands
we
have
purchased
of

in
which
to
lay
our
bones
and
we
shall
hold
on
to
our
possessions
in
jackson
county
for
this
purpose
at
least
the
governor
could
not
and
did
not
blame
them
but
he
trembled
for
the
country
and
dared
not
carry
out
what
he
admitted
to
be
the
plain
imperative

of

repaired
to

and
heard

after

says
parley

the

called
on

to

the

approached
richmond
threats
were
made
that
they
should
not
pass
through
the
town
and
rumor
had
it
that
a
force
of
men
was
in
waiting
to
intercept
them
daylight
of
the
nineteenth
of

saw
them
in
spite
of
the
threats
quietly
passing
through
the
streets
of
the
sleeping
town
when
they
broke
camp
in
the
morning
they
designed
reaching
clay
county
that
day
but
they
met
with
so
many
reverses
in
the
day
march
such
as
wagons
breaking
down
wheels
running
off
that
they
failed
to
accomplish
it
early
in
the
evening
they
went
into
camp
between
two
forks
of
fishing
river
a
plan
had
been
laid
for
the
complete
destruction
of
joe
army
as
zion
camp
was
called
by
the
missourians
and
now
the
time
for
execution
had
arrived
a
mob
of
two
hundred
men
had
been
raised
in
jackson
county
which
was
to
cross
the
missouri
into
clay
county
about
the
mouth
of
fishing
river
where
a
man
named
williams
kept
a
ferry
this
mob
was
to
be
joined
at
the
fords
of
fishing
river
by
a
party
of
sixty
from
richmond
and
still
by
another
mob
seventy
in
number
from
clay
county
indeed
it
looked
as
if
zion
camp
was
to
be
annihilated
forthwith
while
the
brethren
were
making
preparations
for
the
night
five
men
armed
with
guns
rode
into
camp
and
insolently
told
the
brethren
they
would
catch
hell
before
morning
and
their
oaths
says
joseph
partook
of
all
the
malice
of
demons
the
jackson
mob
assembled
opposite
the
mouth
of
fishing
river
and
one
forty
in
number
was
sent
over
by
this
time
the
sun
was
but
little
more
than
an
hour
high
and
the
camp
observed
a
small
cloud
coming
up
from
the
west
it
was
any
larger
than
your
hat
when
i
first
saw
it
said
one
a
who
was
present
and
described
the
occurrence
to
me
but
in
about
twenty
minutes
the
whole
heavens
were
inky
blackness
which
now
and
then
seemed
split
by
the
vivid
streams
of
lightning
all
the
artillery
of
heaven
seemed
to
be
in
action
the
wind
blew
and
the
rain
and
hail
fell
in
torrents
the
hailstones
unusually
large
ones
cut
down
the
corn
crop
and
other
vegetation
large
limbs
were
wrenched
from
sturdy
oaks

fierce
wind

was
the
late

joseph
holbrook
of

county
who
personally
related
the
circumstance
to
me
the
tents
in
the
camp
were
blown
down
and
the
most
of
the
brethren
took
refuge
in
an
old

was

next
morning
and
the
mob
swore
that

river
rose
thirty
feet

minutes
this
storm
prevented
the
mob
from
collecting

that
had
ferried
over
part
of

mob
in
returning
for
more

by

storm
and
only
after
much
difficulty
about
dark
reached
the
jackson
side
those
that
had
been

across
were
exposed
to
the
pitiless
pelting
of

storm

night
which
cooled
their

kill
joe

of
continuing
a
cannonading
which
they
commenced
they
crawled
under
wagons
into
hollow
trees
and
filled
one
old
shanty
b
the
next
morning
they
were
as
anxious
to
reach
the
jackson
side

the
missouri

had
been
the
night
before
to
get
at
joe

negotiations
the
day
following
this
providential
storm
the
camp
moved
out
into
the
prairie
some
five
miles
where
there
was
a
better
chance
to
defend
themselves
here
the
next
day
colonel
sconce
and
two
other
leading
men
from
ray
county
called
upon
the
camp
to
learn
what
the
intentions
of
the
brethren
were
said
the
colonel
i
see
there
is
an
almighty
power
that
protects
this
people
for
i
started
from
richmond
with
a
company
of
armed
men
having
a
full
determination
to
destroy
you
but
was
kept
back
by
the
storm
and
was
not
able
to
reach
you
having
said
so
much
he
was
seized
with
such
excitement
that
he
trembled
from
head
to
foot
like
an
and
had
to
take
a
seat
in
order
to
compose
himself
joseph
in
a
lengthy
speech
related
the
trials
and
persecutions
of
the
saints
particularly
the
sufferings
of
those
in
jackson
county
he
related
the
story
of
the
travels
of
zion
camp
how
they
had
come
one
thousand
miles
to
assist
their
afflicted
brethren
by
bringing
them
clothing
and
to
aid
them
in
returning
to
their
homes
and
maintaining
them
and
denied
the
infamous
reports
circulated
to
arouse
the
anger
of
the
people
against
the
exiled
saints
this
speech
was
so
simple
so
pathetic
and
yet
so
forcible
that
the
strangers
were
melted
by
its
spirit
so
that
they
wept
at
the
story
of
the
persecutions
of
god
people
at
the
close
of
the
speech
they
arose
and
gave
their
hands
to
the
youthful
speaker
promising
to
use
all
their
influence
to
allay
the
excitement
and
correct
the
false
impressions
that
had
gone
out
respecting
the
object
of
the
expedition
a
promise
they
faithfully
kept
it
is
said
of
the
prophet
joseph
that
if
he
could
but
once
get
the
attention
even
of
his
most
bitter
enemies
his
native
eloquence
inspired
by
the
truth
and
the
pathos
of
his
people
sufferings
usually
overwhelmed
them
and
in
no
instance
was
his
triumph
more
marked
than
in
the
one
just
related
the
day
after
the
visit
of
colonel
sconce
cornelius
gillium
the
sheriff
of
clay
county
came
into
camp
and
desired
a
consultation
the
company
was
marched
into
a
grove
adjacent
and
formed
a
large
circle
with
gillium
in
the
center
i
have
heard
that
joseph
smith
is
in
the
camp
and
if
so
i
should
like
to
see
him
commenced
gillium
i
am
the
man
replied
joseph
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
this
was
the
first
time
joseph
was
made
known
to
strangers
since
leaving
kirtland
as
he
had
gone
by
a
fictitious
name
through
the
whole
journey
gillium
then
proceeded
to
describe
the
character
and
disposition
of
the
missourians
and
the
course
that
ought
to
be
pursued
to
secure
their
favor
and
protection
and
concluded
by
requesting
to
know
what
the
intentions
of
the
company
were
this
brought
out
the
statements
we
now
give
which
were
published
in
the
of
the
first
of
july
gillium
communication
being
a
citizen
of
clay
county
and
knowing
there
is
considerable
excitement
amongst
the
people
thereof
and
also
knowing
that
different
reports
are
arriving
almost
hourly
and
being
requested
of
the
hon
ryland
to
meet
the
mormons
under
arms
and
obtain
from
the
leaders
thereof
the
correctness
of
the
various
reports
in
circulation
the
true
intent
and
meaning
of
their
present
movements
and
their
views
generally
regarding
the
difficulties
existing
between
them
and
jackson

i
did
in
company
with
other
gentlemen
call
upon
the
said
leaders
of
the
mormons
at
their
camp
in
clay

and
now

of

in

we
therefore
the
more
cheerfully

we
are
called
upon
by
gentlemen
of
good
feelings
and
who
are
disposed
for
peace
and
an
amicable
adjustment
of
the
difficulties
existing
between
us
and
the
people
of
jackson
county
the
reports
of
our
intentions
are
various
and
have
gone
abroad
in
a
light
calculated
to
arouse
the
feelings
of
almost
every
man
for
instance
one
report
is
that
we
intend
to
demolish
the
printing
office
in

another
report
is
that
we
intend
crossing
the
missouri
river
on
sunday
next
and
falling
upon
women
and
children
and
slaying
them
another
is
that
our
men
were
employed
to
perform
this
expedition
being
taken
from
manufacturing
establishments
in
the
east
that
had
closed
business
also
that
we
carried
a
flag
bearing
peace
on
one
side
and
war
or
blood
on
the
other
and
various
others
too
numerous
to
mention
all
of
which
a
plain
declaration
of
our
intentions
from
under
our
own
hands

not
correct
in
the
first
place
it
is
not
our

any
man
or
set
of
men
it
is
not
our
intention
to
injure
any
man
person
or
property
except
in
defending
ourselves
our
flag
has
been
exhibited
to
the
above
gentlemen
who
will
be
able
to
describe
it
our
men
were
not
taken
from
any
manufacturing
establishment
it

to
go
back
upon
our
lands
in
jackson
county

order
of
the

of

if
possible
we

brought
our
arms
with
us
for
the
purpose
of
as
it
is
well
known
to
almost
every
man
of
the
state
that
we
have
every
reason
to
put
ourselves
in
an
attitude
of
defense
considering
the
abuse
we
have
suffered
in
jackson
county
we
are
anxious
for
a
settlement
of
the
difficulties
existing
between
us
upon
honorable
and
constitutional
principles
we
are
willing
for
twelve
disinterested
men
six
to
be
chosen
by
each
party
and
these
shall
say
what
the
possessions
of
these
men
are
worth
who
can
not
live
with
us
in
the
county
and
they
shall
have
their
money
in
one
year
and
none
of
the
mormons
shall
enter
that
county
to
reside
until
the
money
is
paid
the
damages
that
we
have
sustained
in
consequence
of
being
driven
away
shall
also
be
left
to
the
above
twelve
men
or
they
may
all
live
in
the
county
if
they
choose
and
we
will
never
molest
them
if
they
let
us
alone
and
permit
us
to
enjoy
our
rights
we
want
to
live
in
peace
with
all
men
and
equal
rights
is
all
we
ask
we
wish
to
become
permanent
citizens
of
this
state
and
wish
to
bear
our
proportion
in
support
of
the
government
and
to
be
protected
by
its
laws
if
the
above
propositions
are
complied
with
we
are
willing
to
give
security
on
our
part
and
we
shall
want
the
same
of
the
people
of
jackson
county
for
the
performance
of
this
agreement
we
do
not
wish
to
settle
down
in
a
body
except
where
we
can
purchase
the
land
with
money
for
to
take
possession
by
conquest
or
the
shedding
of
blood
is
entirely
foreign
to
our
feelings
the
shedding
of
blood
we
shall
not
be
guilty
of
until
all
just
and
honorable
means
among
men
prove
insufficient
to
restore
peace

besides
these
evidences
of
a
lack
of
faith
they
were
wanting
in
that
unity
required
by
the
law
of
the
celestial
kingdom
and
it
is
only
through
the
observance
of
that
law
that
zion
can
be
redeemed
the
lord
therefore
commanded
the
elders
to
wait
a
season
for
the
redemption
of
zion
until
the
saints
should
obtain
more
experience
learn
obedience
and
until
means
could
be
raised
to
purchase
all
the
lands
in
jackson
county
that
could
be
purchased
and
also
in
the
surrounding
counties
and
until
the
lord
army
had
become
very
great
and
sanctified
before
him
and
when
this
was
done
the
lord
promised
to
hold
his
people
guiltless
in
taking
possession
of
that
which
was
their
own
and
they
should
possess
it
forever
he
had
permitted
the
elders
composing
the
camp
to
come
thus
far
for
a
trial
of
their
faith
and
now
he
had
prepared
a
great
endowment
for
them
in
the
house
which
he
had
commanded
to
be
built
in
kirtland
those
who
could
stay
in
missouri
were
to
do
so
but
those
who
had
left
their
families
in
the
east
were
at
liberty
to
return
the
saints
who
had
been
driven
from
their
lands
in
jackson
were
instructed
to
carefully
gather
together
in
one
region
as
much
as
could
be
without
exciting
the
fears
of
the
people
they
were
to
be
very
faithful
and
humble
boasting
neither
of
faith
nor
judgments
by
following
this
counsel
the
lord
promised
to
give
them
favor
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
that
they
might
rest
in
peace
while
they
were
saying
to
the
people
execute
judgment
and
justice
for
us
according
to
the
law
and
redress
us
of
our
wrongs
chapter
xxiii
the
threatened
judgment
if
the
day
following
this
revelation
the
camp
left
fishing
river
and
approached
liberty
clay
county
but
when
within
five
or
six
miles
of
that
place
they
were
met
by
general
atchison
and
others
who
requested
them
not
to
go
to
liberty
as
the
people
were
very
greatly
enraged
at
them
as
this
request
was
made
by
men
of
influence
and
those
who
desired
peace
and
who
felt
an
interest
in
the
execution
of
justice
joseph
consented
not
to
go
to
liberty
and
turning
aside
camped
on
rush
creek
near
the
residence
of
sydney
gilbert
and
in
a
brother
burghart
field
the
day
before
three
of
the
brethren
had
suffered
some
with
the
cholera
but
it
was
not
until
the
camp
came
to
rush
creek
that
the
disease
broke
out
among
them
in
its
fury
the
night
of
the
of
june
will
long
be
remembered
by
the
members
of
camp
all
night
long
they
heard
the
moans
and
piteous
cries
of
the
sufferers
and
loud
lamentations
of
those
who
lost
their
loved
ones
by
the
ravages
of
this
dreadful
disease
when
it
first
made
its
appearance
elder
john
carter
attempted
to
rebuke
it
but
he
became
its
first
victim
joseph
also
undertook
to
stay
its
ravages
by
the
laying
on
of
hands
he
administered
to
his
brother
hyrum
the
moment
i
attempted
to
rebuke
the
disease
that
moment
i
was
attacked
he
writes
and
had
i
not
desisted
i
must
have
saved
the
life
of
my
brother
by
the
sacrifice
of
my
own
for
when
i
rebuked
the
disease
it
left
him
and
seized
upon
me
i
quickly
learned
by
painful
experience
that
when
the
great
jehovah
decrees
destruction
upon
any
people
and
makes
known
his
determination
man
must
not
attempt
to
stay
his
hand
the
brethren
unitedly
covenanted
and
prayed
hoping
that
they
might
have
power
with
the
heavens
to
stay
the
ravages
of
the
plague
but
to
no
purpose
for
while
they
were
engaged
in
prayer
elder
wilcox
died
the
deaths
occurred
so
rapidly
that
coffins
could
not
be
prepared
so
the
dead
were
rolled
up
in
blankets
and
put
hurriedly
into
their
graves
and
while
part
of
the
brethren
were
engaged
in
digging
the
graves
others
had
to
stand
guard
musket
in
hand
after
the
plague
had
continued
for
two
or
three
days
an
effectual
remedy
was
found
for
it
by
dipping
those
afflicted
in
cold
water
or
pouring
it
upon
them
in
all
about
seventy
suffered
from
the
cholera
and
out
of
that
number
thirteen
died
the
camp
was
dispersed

our
company
of
men
advanced
yesterday
from
their
encampment
beyond
fishing

to
rush

where
their
tents
are
again
pitched
but
feeling
disposed
to
adopt
every
specific
measure
that
can
be
done
without
jeopardizing
our
lives
to
quiet
the
prejudices
and
fears
of
some
part
of
the
citizens
of
this
county
we
have
concluded
that
our
company
shall
be
immediately
dispersed
and
continue
so
till
every
effort
for
an
adjustment
of
differences
between
us
and
the

but
governor

lacked
that
courage
and
without

the

itself
was
powerless
perhaps
another

is
also
admissible
had
the

been
more

the

might
have

thus
it
is
what

might
attain
to

sometimes

attempt
at
arbitration
whether
it
was
the
fear
of
popular
censure
or
the
approach
of
camp
that
awed
the
jackson
county
mob
into
suggesting
a
peaceable
adjustment
of
their
difficulties
with
the
saints
we
can
not
say
perhaps
both
considerations
had
their
weight
at
any
rate
the
month
of
may
found
them
suggesting
to
governor
dunklin
through
some
influential
gentlemen
of
clay
county
the
propriety
of
dividing
jackson
county
so
that
the
old
settlers
and
the
saints
could
occupy
separate
territory
and
confine
themselves
within
their
respective
limits
with
the
exception
of
the
public
right
of
ingress
and
egress
upon
the
highway
this
plan
of
settling
the
jackson
county
trouble
was
suggested
by
colonel
thornton
and
concurred
in
by
reese
atchison
and
doniphan
their
communication
brought
out
a
reply
from
the
governor
in
which
he
expressed
his
pleasure
at
these
gentlemen
making
an
effort
to
bring
about
a
compromise
of
the
difficulties
he
told
them
that
had
he
not
been
afraid
of
embarrassing
himself
as
an
officer
of
the
state
he
should
have
exerted
himself
to
have
brought
about
a
compromise
even
before
then
but
he
was
fearful
of
traveling
out
of
the
strict
line
of
his
duty
as
the
chief
executive
of
the
state
should
he
do
so
said
he
my
first
advice
would
be
to
the
mormons
to
sell
out
their
lands
in
jackson
county
and
to
settle
somewhere
else
where
they
could
live
in
peace
provided
they
could
get
a
fair
price
for
their
lands
and
reasonable
damages
for
injuries
received
if
this
failed
i
would
try
the
citizens
and
advise
them
to
meet
and
rescind
their
illegal
resolves
of
last
summer
and
agree
to
conform
to
the
laws
in
every
particular
in
respect
to
the
mormons
should
success
attend
neither
of
these
plans
he
would
then
try
the
plan
of
dividing
the
county
as
suggested
by
colonel
thornton
if
all
these
failed
said
the
governor
then
the
simple
question
of
legal
right
would
have
to
settle
it
it
is
this
last
that
i
am
afraid
i
shall
have
to
conform
my
action
to
in
the
end
from
the
whole
tenor
of
this
communication
we
learn
that
even
the
governor
understood
that
the
simple
question
of
would
reinstate
the
saints
on
the
lands
from
which
they
had
been
driven
here
is
an
extract
from
the
letter
which
confirms
this
statement
a
more
clear
and
indisputable
right
does
not
exist
than
that
the
mormon
people
who
were
expelled
from
their
homes
in
jackson
county
should
return
and
live
on
their
lands
and
if
they
can
not
be
persuaded
as
a
matter
of
policy
to
give
up
that
right
or
to
qualify
it
my
course
as
the
chief
executive
officer
of
the
state
is
a
plain
one
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
declares
that
the
citizens
of
each
state
shall
be
entitled
to
all
privileges
and
immunities
of
citizens
in
the
several
states
then
we
can
not
interdict
any
people
who
have
a
political
franchise
in
the
united
states
from
emigrating
to
this
state
nor
from
choosing
what
part
of
the
state
they
will
settle
in
provided
they
do
not
trespass
on
the
property
or
rights
of
others
and
again
our
constitution
says
that
all
men
have
a
natural
and
indefeasible
right
to
worship
almighty
god
according
to
the
dictates
of
their
own
conscience
am
fully
persuaded
that
the
eccentricity
of
the
religious
opinions
and
practices
of
the
mormons
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
outrages
committed
against
they
have
the
right
constitutionally
guaranteed
to
them
and
it
is
indefeasible
to
believe
and
worship
joe
smith
as
a
man
an
angel
or
even
as
the
only
true
and
living
god
and
to
call
their
habitation
zion
the
holy
land
or
even
heaven
itself
indeed
there
is
nothing
so
absurd
or
ridiculous
that
they
have
not
a
right
to
adopt
as
their
religion
so
that
in
its
exercise
they
do
not
interfere
with
the
rights
of
others
surely
this
is
a
liberal
statement
of
the
rights
of
the
saints
and
indeed
of
any
other
people
for
the
rights
privileges
and
immunities
of
the
saints
under
the
government
of
the
united
states
are
no
more
than
those
belonging
to
other
people
certainly
they
are
no
less
still
the
governor
was
loath
to
perform
what
he
admits
to
be
his
plain
duty
in
restoring
the
mormons
to
their
homes
indeed
he
at
length
refused
to
do
it
fearing
that
in
executing
the
law
by
returning
the
saints
to
their
homes
he
would
involve
the
state
in
a
civil
war
he
came
the
easier
to
this
conclusion
doubtless
because
the
sufferers
were
an
unpopular
religious
community
but
if
the
execution
of
law
must
be
abandoned
because
the
violators
thereof
threaten
to
resist
its
execution
or
because
a
reckless
mob
led
by
desperate
men
threaten
that
if
the
law
is
enforced
they
will
plunge
the
country
into
civil
war
what
a
burlesque
on
government
it
would
be
to
refrain
from
the
execution
of
law
on
that
account
on
the
tenth
of
june
the
district
judge
john
ryland
wrote
a
letter
to
elder
gilbert
asking
him
to
use
his
influence
in
gathering
his
brethren
at
liberty
in
clay
county
on
the
sixteenth
of
the
month
saying
that
he
expected
to
meet
a
delegation
of
citizens
from
jackson
county
there
and
he
was
desirous
of
giving
his
views
upon
the
present
situation
of
the
parties
concerned
in
the
jackson
troubles
with
the
hope
of
bringing
about
a
peaceable
adjustment
of
them
this
letter
was
read
in
a
public
meeting
of
the
saints
and
a
respectful
answer
given
promising
that
as
many
of
the
exiles
and
their
friends
as
conveniently
could
attend
the
meeting
on
the
sixteenth
would
be
present
knowing
there
had
been
some
talk
about
the
propriety
of
the
saints
selling
out
their
lands
in
jackson
county
and
fearing
the
judge
would
advise
them
to
do
so
the
brethren
took
occasion
to
say
in
this
communication
to
him
that
no
such
proposition
could
possibly
be
acceded
to
by
them
and
concluded
by
saying
home
is
home
and
we
want
possession
of
our
homes
from
which
we
have
been
wickedly
expelled
and
those
rights
which
belong
to
us
as
native
free
born
citizens
of
the
united
states
about
one
thousand
people
were
in
attendance
at
the
meeting
at
the
courthouse
in
liberty
on
the
sixteenth
of
june
and
among
them
were
many
of
the
brethren
and
a
deputation
of
citizens
from
jackson
county
who
made
the
following
proposition
for
the
settlement
of
the
jackson
difficulties
the
people
of
jackson
county
will
buy
all
the
land
the
mormons
own
in
the
county
of
jackson
and
also
all
the
improvements
which
the
mormons
had
on
any
of
the
public
lands
as
they
existed
before
the
first
disturbance
between
the
people
of
jackson
and
the
mormons
and
for
such
improvements
as
they
have
made
since
the
valuation
of
the
land
and
improvements
shall
be
ascertained
by
three
disinterested
arbitrators
to
be
chosen
and
agreed
upon
by
both
parties
should
the
parties
disagree
in
the
choice
of
arbitrators
then
is
to
choose
them
twelve
mormons
shall
be
permitted
to
go
with
the
arbitrators
to
show
them
their
lands
and
improvements
while
they
are
being
valued
and
any
other
mormons
may
accompany
the
arbitrators
whom
they
may
desire
in
order
to
give
them
information
and
the
people
of
jackson
guarantee
their
entire
safety
while
doing
so
when
the
arbitrators
report
the
value
of
the
land
and
improvements
the
people
of
jackson
will
pay
to
the
mormons
the
valuation
one
hundred
per
cent
added
thereon
within
thirty
days
thereafter
the
mormons
are
to
agree
not
to
make
any
effort
ever
after
to
settle
either
collectively
or
individually
within
the
limits
of
jackson
county
and
are
to
enter
into
bonds
to
insure
the
conveyance
of
their
lands
in
jackson
county
according
to
these
terms
when
the
payment
shall
be
made
and
the
committee
will
enter
into
a
like
bond
with
such
security
as
shall
be
sufficient
for
the
payment
of
the
money
according
to
this
proposition
while
the
arbitrators
are
investigating
and
deciding
upon
the

after
these
propositions
were

to

a
number
of
speeches
were
made
in

was
manifested
against

minister
said

lived
long

the

replied
let

be

let

honor
our
country
and
not
disgrace
it
like

do
disfranchise

have
armed
themselves
if

do

they
are
cowards

love
to
hear
that

can
no
man
show
than
he
who
lays
down

for
his

cries
of
adjourn
and
no
no
go
on
were
now
heard
mingled
with
curses
loud
and
deep
and
the
ominous
gleaming
of
knives
and
cocking
of
pistols
to
add
to
the
excitement
a
man
by
the
door
yelled
out
a
man
stabbed
at
this
those
in
the
court
room
rushed
out
to
learn
what
had
happened
it
turned
out
that
a
blacksmith
by
the
name
of
calbert
had
stabbed
a
man
by
the
name
of
wales
who
had
boasted
of
having
whipped
many
of
the
mormons
one
of
whom
had
nearly
lost
his
life
through
the
injuries
received
the
meeting
broke
up
without
further
bloodshed
in
the
midst
of
this
excitement
a
few
of
the
brethren
retired
and
addressed
a
communication
to
the
jackson
county
delegation
in
attendance
at
the
meeting
to
the
effect
that
their
proposition
for
a
settlement
of
the
jackson
difficulties
would
be
presented
to
the
saints
and
an
answer
to
it
would
be
handed
to
judge
turnham
by
the
twentieth
sooner
if
possible
the
brethren
assured
the
jackson
delegation
that
peace
was
what
they
desired
and
promised
to
use
all
their
influence
to
establish
it
and
disclaimed
any
design
to
commence
hostilities
against
the
inhabitants
of
jackson
county
and
further
pledged
themselves
to
use
their
influence
to
prevent

the

delegation
went
to
ducker
ferry
and
started
to
cross
the
missouri
but
when
about
the
middle
of
the
river
their
boat
suddenly
went
down
as
if
made
of
lead
there
was
no
storm
the
river
was
calm
and
no
natural
explanation
could
be
given
for
the
sinking
of
the
boat
joseph
declared
that
the
angel
of
the
lord
sank
it
b
indeed
the
circumstances
are
such
as
to
go
very
far
toward
strengthening
the
statement
it
is
supposed
that
about
twelve
men
were
in
the
boat
and
of
this
number
seven

were
drowned

by

about
three
weeks
after
the
occurrence
on
a
pile
of
some
four
or
five
miles
below
where
the
boat
sank

little
more
than
the
skeleton
of
the
man
remained
his
flesh
had
been
eaten
by
the
eagles
and
buzzards
his
fate
points
a
fearful
warning
to
those
who
raise
their
hands
against
god
anointed
it
gives
us
reason
to
believe
that
the
day
is
not
distant
when
the
command
of
jehovah
touch

do
my

chapter

the
pros
and
cons
of
arbitration
proposition
having
related
the
principal
events
connected
with
the
meeting
held
at
liberty
we
must
consider
the
propositions
made
by
the
jackson
people
to
the
saints
for
the
peaceful
adjustment
of
their
difficulties
to
have
the
lands
owned
by
the
saints
and
the
improvements
thereon
valued
by
disinterested
arbitrators
and
the
amount
paid
with
hundred
per
cent
within
thirty
days
looks
like
a
very
fair
proposition
but
still
the
saints
could
not
accept
such
terms
as
the
condition
upon
which
the
proposition
was
made
required
the
surrender
of
some
of
their
rights
as
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
freemen
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
says
expressly
the
citizens
of
each
state
shall
be
entitled
to
all
privileges
and
immunities
of
citizens
in
the
several
states
a
the
saints
were
citizens
of
the
united
states
possessing
all
the
rights
and
franchises
thereof
and
they
had
a
right
an
indefeasible
one
too
to
settle
in
whatever
state
they
saw
proper
to
choose
for
their
abode
and
they
had
a
right
to
settle
in
whatever
part
of
the
state
pleased
them
best
and
as
governor
dunklin
admitted
they
had
a
right
to
call
their
habitation
zion
the
holy
land
or
heaven
itself
so
long
as
in
doing
so
they
interfered
not
with
the
property
and
rights
of
others
to
accept
the
proposition
of
the
jackson
people
therefore
and
bind
themselves
never
again
to
make
any
effort
to
settle
collectively
or
individually
within
the
limits
of
jackson
county
would
be
a
surrender
of
their
dearest
rights
of
citizenship
and
would
be
permitting
mobocrats
and
murderers
to
dictate
them
in
the
exercise
of
their
liberties
binding
not
only
themselves
but
their
children
as
well
to
the
dictum
of
these
wretches
to
accept
such
a
settlement
of
their
troubles
would
have
been
a
covenant
with
death
an
agreement
with
hell
to
their
honor
be
it
said
they
spurned
the
proposition
with
the
contempt
it
deserved
footnote
a
const
art
iv
section
but
the
surrender
of
some
of
their
rights
as
citizens
of
the
united
states
was
not
the
only
difficulty
involved
in
the
settlement
of
the
jackson
troubles
by
the
saints
selling
their
possessions
god
had
revealed
it
to
them
that
jackson
county
was
the
place
where
is
to
be
built
the
zion
of
their
god
for
them
to
sell
their
lands
then
and
agree
never
after
to
make
a
settlement
there
collectively
or
individually
would
be
a
denial
of
their
faith
and
bring
upon
them
the
displeasure
of
their
god
for
them
to
sell
their
lands
was
entirely
out
of
the
question
but
the
mob
offered
not
only
to
buy
but
to
sell
upon
the
same
conditions
that
they
proposed
to
buy
why
did
not
the
saints
accept
this
offer
simply
because
they
could
not
and
the
citizens
of
jackson
knew
very
well
they
could
not
the
old
settlers
of
jackson
owned
many
times
more
the
amount
of
land
than
was
possessed
by
the
saints
say
thirty
acres
to
one
the
saints
were
not
wealthy
to
begin
with
and
now
after
they
had
been
driven
from
their
homes
robbed
of
their
goods
their
cattle
driven
away
their
houses
stables
and
stacks
of
grain
burned
they
are
asked
to
buy
nearly
the
whole
of
jackson
county
for
which
they
must
pay
double
price
because
they
were
to
add
hundred
per
to
the
appraised
value
in
days
i
do
believe
the
people
of
jackson
county
were
sincere
in
making
the
proposition
they
knew
the
saints
could
not
sell
their
lands
without
surrendering
many
of
their
rights
as
free
men
and
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
without
being
untrue
to
their
god
by
virtually
denying
their
faith
in
the
revelations
he
had
given
regarding
the
building
up
of
zion
in
jackson
county
this
the
old
settlers
knew
the
mormons
would
not
do
they
had
tried
to
whip
and
frighten
too
many
of
them
into
a
denial
of
their
religious
convictions
to
think
for
one
moment
that
money
would
be
any
inducement
for
them
to
deny
that
faith
on
the
other
hand
they
determined
to
put
the
price
of
their
own
land
beyond
the
possibility
of
the
saints
purchasing
it
the
whole
scheme
was
concocted
with
a
view
of
covering
up
their
outrages
against
the
people
of
god
under
an
appearance
of
fairness
in
the
corrupted
currents
of
this
world
where
offense
gilded
hand
may
shove
by
justice
where
hypocrisy
is
often
mistaken
for
piety
and
cunning
for
fairness
the
subterfuge
may
have
served
its
purpose
but
when
the
wretches
who
would
have
murdered
the
saints
and
plundered
them
of
their
goods
shall
stand
before
the
bar
of
god
where
there
is
no
shuffling
but
where
the
actions
of
men
lie
in
their
true
light
they
will
find
their
refuge
of
deceit
will
not
shield
them
from
the
justice

the
saints
refused
to
accept
the
terms
of
settlement
made
by
the
people
of
jackson
but
they
themselves
proposed
terms
of
adjustment
as
follows
twelve
disinterested
men
were
to
be
chosen
six
by
the
exiles
six
by
the
people
of
jackson
county
these
twelve
men
were
to
say
what
the
possessions
of
those
men
were
worth
that
would
not
consent
to
live
with
the
mormon
people
and
they
should
receive
the
money
for
the
same
in
one
year
from
the
time
the
treaty
was
made
none
of
the
saints
to
enter
jackson
county
to
reside
until
the
money
was
paid
this
same
company
of
twelve
men
was
to
be
empowered
to
say
what
the
damage
was
which
the
mormons
sustained
in
being
driven
from
their
homes
and
in
the
destruction
of
their
property
the
said
amount
allowed
for
damages
to
be
deducted
from
the
amount
paid
for
the
lands
of
those
who
would
not
consent
to
live
with
the
saints
the
only
reply
received
to
this
proposition
was
in
a
letter
from
owens
to
amos
reese
which
plainly
said
the
jackson
people
would
listen
to
nothing
like
the
proposition
made
by
the
mormons
and

the
hopes
of
settling
the
jackson

an

the
work
accomplished

considerable
during

the
first
of

with
a
few
of
the
brethren
he
crossed
the

contending
emotions
would
be
awakened
by
such
a
visit
there
just
to
the
west

years
before
he
had
assembled
with
his
brethren
and
dedicated
a

for
the
temple
of
the

now
and
then
they
would
come
to
the
ruined
homes
of
the
brethren
now
in
vision
he
might
for
a
moment
see
the
future
glory
of
zion

he
would
weep
to
think
of
the

stripped
of
all
their
earthly
goods

in

of
strangers
whose
bond
of
friendship
was
not

proceeded
to

a
variety
of
subjects
pertaining

the
situation

its
members
they
made
a
direct
appeal
to
the

and
to
mankind
everywhere
stating
their
wrongs
and
imploring
their
assistance
in
securing

maintaining
their
rights
they
declared
their
devotion
to
the
laws
of
their
country
and
their
faith
in

and
the
final
establishment
of
zion
in

that

much

they
were
to
work
quietly
setting
the

in
order
and
teaching
them
the
way
of
holiness
as
the

by
his

wrote
the

concerning

governor
had
expressed
his
willingness
to
escort
the
saints
back
to
their
lands
by
aid
of
the
state
militia
though
holding
that
he
had
no
authority
of

to
keep
a
military
force
under
arms
for
their
protection
and
do
the
best
he
could
in
maintaining
the
ground
if
the
excitement
continued
to
abate
then
the
saints
were
to
gather
quietly
together
in

to
move
into
jackson

with

perform

remaineth

during
the
two
years
following
the
prophet
was
busily
engaged
in
setting
in
order
the
various
quorums
of
the
priesthood
in
the
winter
of
the
quorum
of
twelve
apostles
and
the
first
quorum
of
seventies
were
organized
being
chosen
principally
from
among
those
brethren
who
had
gone
up
to
missouri
in
zion
camp
but
amid
the
busy
scenes
at
kirtland
while
organizing
these
quorums
and
instructing
them
in
the
duties
of
their
respective
callings
attending
the
school
for
the
elders
studying
hebrew
under
professor
sexias
translating
some
rolls
of
egyptian
papyrus
containing
the
precious
book
of
abraham
which
he
purchased
from
chandler
attending
to
general
duties
and
correspondence
amid
all
these
busy
scenes
joseph
still
had
time
to
think
of
zion
and
her
redemption
on
the
occasion
of
a
large
body
of
the
priesthood
being
present
at
a
meeting
in
kirtland
on
the
second
of
may
he
moved
that
they
never
give
up
the
struggle
for
the
redemption
of
zion
so
long
as
life
should
last
september
following
the
high
council
met
at
the
house
of
the
prophet
to
take
into
consideration
the
redemption
of
zion
it
was
the
decision
of
the
council
that
the
saints
who
had
been
expelled
from
zion
petition
the
governor
of
the
state
to
reinstate
them
the
following
spring
and
they
would
either
live
or
die
on
their
lands
and
joseph
prayed
that
they
might
be
successful
in
getting
eight
hundred
or
a
thousand
emigrants
to
go
up
to
settle
in
zion
still
later
viz
thirteenth
of
march
the
first
presidency
resolved
to
remove
on
or
before
the
fifteenth
of
may
next
to
zion
that
their
influence
might
be
more
effectual
in
encouraging
the
saints
to
gather
there
but
events
of
a
strange
character
were
to
occur
that
would
prevent
the
carrying
out
of
these
resolutions
the
saints
did
not
comply
with
the
conditions
upon
which
zion
was
to
be
redeemed
they
did
not
with
a
united
effort
do
their
duty
they
did
not
give
of
their
means
liberally
nor
did
their
young
men
volunteer
readily
to
go
up
to
zion
hence
they
were
not
entitled
to
the
fulfillment
of
god
promise
to
redeem
zion
but
instead
of
this
blessing
there
was
suspended
over
them
the
promised
scourge
of
being
driven
from
city
to
city
because
they
failed
to
keep
the
commandments
a
scourge
that
has
been
executed
to
the
uttermost
but
i
will
not
anticipate
the
story
the
petitions
the
elders
circulated
throughout
the
states
in
their
travels
asking
the
people
to
petition
the
governor
of
missouri
to
reinstate
the
saints
in
their
homes
met
with
a
response
that
was
considerable
i
can
not
learn
how
many
names
were
attached
to
this
petition
but
when
it
was
mailed
on
the
ninth
of
december
the
package
was
large
the
postage
amounting
to
five
dollars
but
all
these
efforts
failed
to
move
the
state
officials
of
missouri
to
make
any
effectual
effort
towards
restoring
the
exiles
to
their
own
and
protecting
them
in
the
quiet
possession
of
their
property
and
lives
chapter
xxvii
peaceful
exodus
from
clay
county
meantime
the
presence
of
the
saints
in
clay
county
began
to
be
a
cause
of
uneasiness
among
the
mormons
of
the
community
the
leading
citizens
of
the
county
assembled
at
the
courthouse
in
liberty
on
the
of
june
to
consider
the
difficulties
threatening
the
people
of
clay
county
in
consequence
of
the
presence
of
the
mormons
after
the
usual
organization
at
such
meetings
the
committee
on
resolutions
reported
a
document
that
briefly
stated
the
circumstances
under
which
the
mormons
flocked
into
clay
county
without
money
without
property
without
food
for
their
wives
and
children
and
like
noah
dove
without
a
resting
place
for
their
feet
and
how
the
people
of
clay
county
in
face
of
the
thousand
reports
accusing
them
of
every
crime
known
to
the
laws
of
the
country
had
treated
them
with
toleration
and
often
with
peculiar
kindness
the
document
referred
to
the
statements
of
the
leading
brethren
who
had
said
they
did
not
regard
clay
county
as
their
permanent
home
but
merely
as
a
temporary
asylum
which
they
would
promptly
leave
whenever
a
respectable
portion
of
the
citizens
of
the
county
should
request
it
and
now
the
best
interest
of
the
county
demanded
the
fulfillment
of
that
pledge
the
reasons
why
the
saints
had
become
objectionable
as
permanent
citizens
to
many
of
the
people
of
clay
county
were
stated
to
be
their
religious
tenets
were
so
different
from
the
present
churches
of
the
age
that
this
always
had
and
always
would
excite
deep
prejudice
against
them
in
any
populous
country
where
they
might
locate
they
were
eastern
men
whose
manners
habits
customs
and
even
dialect
were
essentially
different
from
the
missourians
they
were
holders
and
opposed
to
slavery
which
excited
deep
and
abiding
prejudices
in
a
community
which
tolerated
and
protected
slavery
common
report
had
it
that
they
kept
up
a
constant
communication
with
the
indian
tribes
on
the
frontier
and
declared
from
the
pulpit
that
the
indians
were
a
part
of
god
chosen
people
destined
by
heaven
to
inherit
with
them
the
land
of
missouri
we
do
not
vouch
for
the
correctness
of
these
statements
said
the
committee
in
their
report
but
whether
they
are
true
or
false
their
effect
has
been
the
same
in
exciting
our
community
the
causes
named
are
represented
as
having
raised
a
prejudice
against
the
saints
and
a
feeling
of
hostility
that
the
first
spark
might
and
the
committee
deeply
feared
would
ignite
into
all
the
horrors
and
desolations
of
a
civil
war
and
it
was
resolved
that
it
is
the
fixed
and
settled
conviction
of
this
meeting
that
unless
the
people
commonly
called
mormons
will
agree
to
stop
immediately
the
immigration
of
their
people
to
this
country
and
take
measures
to
remove
themselves
from
it
a
civil
war
is
inevitable
we
do
not
contend
that
we
have
the
least
right
under
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
country
to
expel
them
by
force
but
we
would
indeed
be
blind
if
we
did
not
foresee
that
the
first
blow
that
is
struck
at
this
moment
of
deep
excitement
must
and
will
speedily
involve
every
individual
in
a
war
bearing
ruin
woe
and
desolation
in
its
course
it
matters
but
little
how
where
or
by
whom
the
war
may
begin
when
the
work
of
destruction
commences
we
must
all
be
borne
onward
by
the
storm
or
crushed
beneath
its
fury
the
saints
were
told
that
if
they
had
one
spark
of
gratitude
they
would
not
willingly
plunge
a
people
into
civil
war
who
had
held
out
to
them
the
friendly
hand
of
assistance
in
the
dark
hour
of
their
distress
a
committee
of
ten
were
appointed
to
present
these
views
to
the
leading
elders
among
the
mormons
with
the
understanding
that
if
the
saints
would
consent
to
move
as
requested
the
gentlemen
who
had
called
the
meeting
and
now
asked
them
to
leave
clay
county
would
use
all
their
influence
to
allay
the
excitement
among
the
citizens
of
the
county
the
reply
of
the
saints
to
the
request
to
remove
from
clay
county
was
adopted
at
a
general
mass
meeting
in
their
reply
they
expressed
their
appreciation
of
the
kindness
shown
them
by
the
people
of
clay
county
they
denied
having
any
disposition
to
meddle
with
slavery
they
also
denied
holding
communication
with
the
indians
and
said
they
held
themselves
as
ready
to
defend
their
country
against
their
barbarous
ravages
as
any
other
people
after
making
these
denials
they
resolved
that
for
the
sake
of
friendship
and
to
be
in
a
covenant
of
peace
with
the
citizens
of
clay
county
and
they
to
be
in
a
covenant
of
peace
with
us
notwithstanding
the
necessary
loss
of
property
and
expense
we
incur
in
moving
we
comply
with
the
requisitions
of
their
resolutions
in
leaving
the
county
of
clay
as
explained
by
the
preamble
accompanying
the
same
and
that
we
will
use
our
exertions
to
have
the
church
do
the
same
it
appears
that
the
committee
who
had
presented
the
resolutions
of
the
clay
county
citizens
had
tendered
their
services
to
assist
the
saints
in
selecting
a
new
location
and
the
latter
resolved
to
accept
that
assistance
the
reply
from
the
saints
was
perfectly
satisfactory
to
the
people
of
clay
county
and
the
latter
made
some
arrangements
to
assist
the
former
in
complying
with
their
request
that
is
two
persons
from
each
township
were
appointed
to
raise
money
by
subscription
to
aid
the
mormons
who
might
need
assistance
to
leave
the
county
and
also
arrange
for
some
suitable
person
to
assist
them
in
selecting
a
new
location
for
settlement
and
recommended
the
mormons
to
the
good
treatment
of
the
citizens
in
surrounding
counties
and
asked
them
to
assist
the
exiles
in
selecting
some
abiding
place
where
they
would
be
in
a
measure
the
only
occupants
of
the
land
and
where
none
would
be
anxious
to
molest
them
on
the
of
july
the
brethren
received
a
letter
from
governor
dunklin
that
was
the
funeral
knell
to
their
hopes
of
executive
interference
in
their
behalf
he
informed
them
their
cases
were
individual
cases
and
as
such
were
subjects
for
judicial
interference
and
not
for
the
special
cognizance
of
the
executive
and
to
this
the
governor
added
and
there
are
cases
some
times
of
individual
outrage
which
may
be
so
popular
as
to
render
the
actions
of
the
courts
of
justice
nugatory
in
endeavoring
to
afford
a
remedy
a
public
sentiment
may
become
paramount
law
and
when
one
man
or
society
of
men
become
so
obnoxious
to
that
sentiment
as
to
determine
the
people
to
be
rid
of
him
or
them
it
is
useless
to
run
counter
to
it
your
neighbors
accuse
your
people
of
holding
illicit
communication
with
the
indians
and
of
being
opposed
to
slavery
you
deny
whether
the
charge
or
the
denial
is
true
i
can
not
tell
the
exists
and
your
neighbors
seem
to
believe
it
true
and
whether
true
or
false
the
consequences
will
be
the
same
unless
you
can
by
your
conduct
and
arguments
convince
them
of
your
innocence
if
you
can
not
do
this
all
can
to
you
is
that
in
the
is
the
what
a
mockery
then
is
such
government
under
it
none
may
hope
to
enjoy
liberty
but
those
who
are
willing
to
swim
in
the
stream
of
popular
sentiment
a
stream
oftener
filthy
than
clean
oftener
wrong
than
right
influenced
by
passion
rather
than
reason
how
precarious
is
the
hold
of
the
inhabitants
of
such
a
government
upon
their
liberties
depending
upon
the
changing
whims
of
the
populace
the
populace
which
will
weep
a
caesar
slain
vote
a
monument
to
brutus
under
such
a
government
what
is
to
become
of
reformers
perhaps
the
fate
of
reformers
of
other
ages
who
have
fallen
victims
to
the
hatred
of
popular
sentiment
will
answer
the
question
what
is
to
become
of
the
weaker
parties
if
all
are
to
be
crushed
or
banished
that
popular
sentiment
condemns
for
what
are
governments
established
if
not
to
protect
the
weak
as
well
as
the
strong
the
despised
as
well
as
the
favored
in
the
enjoyment
of
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
what
do
constitutions
amount
to
if
they
are
not
recognized
as
conservators
of
liberty
by
acting
as
restraints
upon
these
rash
acts
of
injustice
so
frequently
prompted
by
the
frenzy
of
popular
sentiment
a
sentiment
often
manufactured
by
a
misrepresentation
of
the
principles
and
motives
of
those
against
whom
the
injustice
is
levelled
in
popular
governments
constitutions
are
adopted
for
the
express
purpose
of
restraining
the
majority
in
the
exercise
of
its
power
and
to
guarantee
the
enjoyment
of
rights
and
liberties
to
the
minority
to
those
out
of
favor
with
the
popular
sentiment
of
the
hour
the
tyranny
of
a
majority
is
known
and
feared
and
hence
it
is
restrained
by
constitutional
provisions
which
thus
become
the
bulwarks
of
freedom
by
especially
guarding
the
weak
against
the
strong
it
may
be
held
that
in
popular
governments
the
constitutions
and
laws
enacted
in
accordance
therewith
are
but
the
expressions
of
popular
sentiment
grant
it
but
the
popular
sentiment
as
expressed
in
constitutions
and
laws
is
very
different
from
that
expressed
by
an
excited
populace
not
unfrequently
controlled
by
demagogues
popular
sentiment
is
often
created
by
intemperate
speeches
and
sustained
by
misrepresentation
but
the
popular
sentiment
as
expressed
by
laws
and
constitutions
is
adopted
in
legislative
halls
where
has
a
chance
to
assist
in
forming
the
sentiment
and
where
a
decent
respect
for
the
long
established
maxims
of
justice
and
liberty
will
be
taken
into
consideration
and
will
influence
the
legislature
in
forming
the
rules
for
the
action
of
the
people
when
popular
sentiment
is
expressed
in
constitutions
and
laws
and
they
are
enforced
the
citizens
are
in
a
measure
at
least
secure
from
oppression
and
sudden
destruction
but
what
guarantee
have
the
people
against
injustice
being
done
if
an
inconsiderate
frenzied
popular
sentiment
is
to
be
enforced
a
sentiment
that
falsehood
creates
and
that
passion
directs
none
whatever
and
when
the
citizens
of
the
american
republic
regard
the
prejudiced
and
excited
voice
of
the
populace
as
the
voice
of
god
as
governor
dunklin
of
missouri
did
let
them
bid
an
everlasting
farewell

at
the
time
the
saints
were
requested
to
leave
their
homes
in
clay
county
the
whole
northern
part
of
missouri
was
very
sparsely
settled
and
but
few
counties
were
organized
as
it
was
desirable
on
the
part
of
the
saints
to
obtain
a
location
where
they
would
be
the
principal
settlers
and
occupants
of
the
lands
where
they
would
be
free
from
injustice
and
violence

mobs
where
they
might
quietly
gather
together
and
be
taught
to
observe
the
principles

might

had
traveled
through

had
described
it
to

some
two
years
before
it
was
recommended
to
the
attention
of
the
brethren
by
their
influential
friends
in
clay

and
so
the
month
of
october
found
a
number
of
them
settling
on
shoal

they
soon
petitioned
for
an
enactment
organizing
a
new
county

was
granted
the
new

organized

of

high
rolling
prairie
country
and
is
visible
from
a
long
distance
standing
on
what
used
to
be
the
public
square
of
far
west
on
the
occasion
of
my
visit
there
in
i
obtained
an
excellent
view
of
all
the
surrounding
country
vast
fields
of
waving
corn
and
meadow
land
were
stretched
out
on
all
sides
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
several
towns
and
villages
with
their
white
church
spires
gleaming
in
the
were
in
plain
view
though
from
five
to
ten
miles
distant
away
to
the
east
is
kingston
the
present
county
seat
of
caldwell
further
to
the
northeast
is
breckenridge
hamilton
and
kidder
to
the
west
is
plattsburg
and
south
is
the
quaint
village
of
polo
all
these
places
are
within
easy
vision
from
the
site
of
far
west
and
increase
the
grandeur
of
the
scene
the
site
chosen
for
far
west
is
the
finest
location
for
a
city
in
the
county
but
notwithstanding
all
the
advantages
of
the
location
far
west
has
been
abandoned
in
the
fall
of
it
was
a
thriving
town
of
some
three
thousand
inhabitants
but
today
nothing
remains
except
the
house
of
the
prophet
joseph
now
owned
by
kerr
a
and
one
portion
of
the
whitmer
hotel
now
used
as
a
stable
this
is
all
that
remains
of
the
buildings
at
far
west
erected
by
the
hands
of
the
saints
a
few
farm
houses
have
been
built
in
the
vicinity
since
their
expulsion
from
missouri
and
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
public
square
stands
a
neat
white
methodist
church
footnote
a
at
least
it
was
owned
by
him
in
nothing
but
an
excavation
one
hundred
and
ten
feet
by
eighty
enclosed
in
an
old
field
with
a
large
rough
unhewn
stone
in
each
corner
now
marks
the
spot
that
was
once
the
pretentious
public
square
of
far
west
this
excavation
was
made
on
the
of
july
and
was
intended
for
the
basement
of
the
temple
the
saints
expected
to
erect
there
there
are
several
very
interesting
circumstances
connected
with
this
old
excavation
and
the
rough
corner
stones
that
will
be
related
as
the
circumstances
of
which
i
am
writing
shall
bring
them
due
standing
on
this
consecrated
ground
and
viewing
the
few
relics
that
are
left
to
remind
us
that
the
saints
once
lived
here
one
naturally
falls
into
a
sad
reverie
it
is
true
we
are
not
surrounded
by
the
fallen
columns
of
ruined
temples
or
the
ruins
of
splendid
palaces
or
massive
walls
such
as
one
would
meet
with
at
babylon
jerusalem
rome
or
athens
it
is
not
the
ruins
of
an
antique
or
celebrated
civilization
that
inspires
one
sadness
over
far
west
but
there
one
sits
in
the
midst
of
the
ruined
prospects
and
blighted
hopes
of
the
saints
of
god
instead
of
in
the
midst
of
broken
columns
ponderous
arches
and
crumbling
walls
the
chief
interest
about
far
west
of
course
is
the
fact
that
it
was
the
theatre
where
was
enacted
those
stirring
scenes
which
add
another
black
page
to
the
history
of
missouri
if
that
strange
people
says
crosby
jackson
in
his
history
of
caldwell
county
who
built
nauvoo
and
salt
lake
who
uncomplainingly
toiled
across
the
american
desert
and
made
the
wilderness
of
utah
to
bloom
like
a
garden
had
been
permitted
to
remain
and
perfect
the
work
which
they
had
begun
here
how
different
would
have
been
the
history
of
far
west
instead
of
being
a
farm
with
scarcely
sufficient
ruins
to
mark
the
spot
where
once
it
stood
there
would
have
been
a
rich
populous
city
along
the
streets
of
which
would
be
pouring
the
wealth
of
the
world
and
instead
of
an
old
dilapidated
farmhouse
there
would
have
been
magnificent
temples
to
which
the
devout
saints
from
the
further
corners
of
the
world
would
have
made
their
yearly
pilgrimage
but
the
bigotry
and
intolerance
of
the
saints
towards
the
gentiles
and
especially
toward
dissenters
from
the
new
revelations
of
joe
smith
rendered
such
a
consummation
impossible
it
now
becomes
my
duty
to
relate
those
circumstances
which
prevented
the
saints
from
building
up
far
west
and
which
at
last
drove
them
as
exiles
from
the
state
of
missouri
and
we
shall
in
the
course
of
our
narrative
see
whether
it
was
the
bigotry
and
intolerance
of
the
saints
towards
the
gentiles
and
dissenters
that
brought
about
the
fate
of
far
west
or
whether
it
was
the
brutal
savagery
of
pretended
christians
incited
to
deeds
of
cruelty
by
jealous
sectarian
ministers
and
unscrupulous
demagogues
fearful
of
the
growing
political
power
of
the
mormons
the
first
settlement
in
the
vicinity
of
far
west
was
made
in
october
by
july
following
about
one
hundred
buildings
had
been
erected
eight
of
which
were
stores
this
same
month
the
school
section
of
land
was
sold
at
auction
and
although
entirely
a
prairie
it
sold
on
a
year
credit
for
seven
dollars
and
ninety
cents
per
acre
making
the
settlers
school
fund
about
five
thousand
dollars
some
of
the
church
expressed
a
desire
to
establish
saloons
in
the
growing
town
and
endeavored
to
induce
some
of
the
brethren
to
sell
intoxicants
on
commission
for
them
but
the
high
council
resolved
not
to
sustain
any
persons
as
members
of
the
church
who
would
become
retailers
of
spirituous
liquors
and
the
liquor
business
was
dropped
in
september
the
church
at
kirtland
appointed
joseph
smith
and
sidney
rigdon
to
seek
out
new
places
for
the
gathering
of
the
saints
and
lay
off
other
stakes
of
zion
than
those
of
far
west
and
kirtland
on
this
mission
joseph
and
sidney
arrived
at
far
west
in
the
latter
part
of
october
a
council
of
the
priesthood
was
called
at
which
it
was
decided
that
there
was
sufficient
room
in
the
vicinity
of
far
west
for
the
gathering
of
the
saints
from
abroad
and
hence
it
was
decided
that
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
present
to
select
other
places
at
a
general
conference
convened
in
october
the
several
quorums
of
the
priesthood
were
set
in
order
men
and
measures
were
thoroughly
discussed
difficulties
were
adjusted
and
covenants
of
brotherly
love
renewed
elders
were
started
out
to
preach
the
gospel
it
was
voted
to
enlarge
the
town
plat
of
far
west
so
that
it
would
contain
four
sections
two
miles
square
the
conference
also
voted
not
to
support
any
stores
or
shops
selling

chapter

the
fall
of
david
whitmer
and
oliver
cowdery
thus
far
west
was
founded
and
the
impediments
to
her
growth
as
a
strictly
moral
and
temperance
city
removed
and
yet
causes
were
at
work
that
were
undermining
the
spiritual
strength
of
many
of
the
saints
and
killing
the
influence
of
a
number
of
the
elders
in
high
positions
a
wave
of
speculation
especially
in
lands
swept
over
the
entire
country
and
the
brethren
partook
largely
of
this
spirit
which
proved
ruinous
to
their
spiritual
life
among
those
who
were
affected
by
this
spirit
of
wild
speculation
to
their
injury
were
john
whitmer
and
phelps
shortly
afterwards
oliver
cowdery
and
david
whitmer
two
of
the
three
witnesses
to
the
truth
of
the
book
of
mormon
were
excommunicated
the
charges
sustained
before
the
high
council
against
oliver
cowdery
were
persecuting
the
brethren
by
urging
on
vexatious
law
suits
against
them
and
thus
distressing
the
innocent
seeking
to
destroy
the
character
of
joseph
smith
by
falsely
insinuating
that
he
was
guilty
of
adultery
treating
the
church
with
contempt
by
not
attending
meetings
leaving
his
calling
to
which
god
had
appointed
him
by
revelation
for
the
sake
of
filthy
lucre
and
turning
to
the
practice
of
law
disgracing
the
church
by
being
connected
in
the
bogus
business
as
common
report
says
a
footnote
a
upper
missouri
was
infested
with
sharps
engaged
in
counterfeiting
the
currency
of
the
united
states
and
common
rumor
connected
oliver
cowdery
with
them
dishonestly
retaining
notes
after
they
had
been
paid
and
finally
forsaking
the
cause
of
god
and
returning
to
the
beggarly
elements
of
the
world
and
neglecting
his
high
and
holy
calling
according
to
his
profession
the
charges
sustained
against
david
whitmer
were
not
observing
the
word
of
wisdom
conduct
in
neglecting
to
attend
meetings
and
in
uniting
with
and
possessing
the
same
spirit
as
the
dissenters
writing
letters
to
the
dissenters
in
kirtland
unfavorable
to
the
cause
and
to
the
character
of
joseph
smith
neglecting
the
duties
of
his
calling
and
separating
himself
from
the
church
signing
himself
president
of
the
church
of
christ
in
an
insulting
letter
to
the
high
council
after
he
had
been
cut
off
from
the
presidency

in
reorganizing
the
quorums
of
the
priesthood
at
far
west
in
november
to
which
we
have
alluded
david
whitmer
was
made
president
of
the
church
in
missouri
and
phelps
and
john
whitmer
counselors
but
the
whole
church
under
the
leadership
of
thomas
marsh
lyman
wight
david
patten
and
others
on
february
met
as
a
committee
of
the
whole
and
preferred
serious
charges
of
wickedness
against
the
three
presidents
and
refused
to
sustain
them
in
their
office
the
vote
which
deposed
them
was
unanimous
but
the
presidents
refused
to
acknowledge
the
authority
of
the
church
and
continued
to
sign
documents
as
presidents
of
the
church
it
is
this
to
which
the
fifth
charge
against
david
whitmer
refers
as
before
stated
these
two
men
oliver
cowdery
and
david
whitmer
were
two
of
the
three
special
witnesses
to
the
book
of
mormon
it
was
therefore
a
bold
move
to
excommunicate
them
although
it
may
be
thought
outside
the
theme
i
am
following
in
these
pages
to
make
such
a
digression
still
i
can
not
refrain
from
indulging
in
the
following
reflections
suppose
for
a
moment
that
the
theory
of
the
world
relative
to
the
origin
of
the
book
of
mormon
be
true
that
is
that
it
was
the
production
of
solomon
spaulding
or
sidney
rigdon
that
joseph
smith
was
put
forward
as
a
and
the
three
witnesses
were
induced
to
become
parties
to
the
fraud
that
was
to
be
perpetrated
on
mankind
if
this
supposition
were
true
would
joseph
smith
and
sidney
rigdon
under
such
circumstances
have
dared
to
withdraw
their
fellowship
from
these
men
if
the
book
of
mormon
were
a
huge
scheme
to
deceive
mankind
and
cowdery
and
whitmer
were
parties
with
smith
and
rigdon
to
the
deception
the
latter
would
hardly
venture
to
cast
away
the
former
for
fear
they
might
deny
their
testimony
expose
the
fraud
and
cause
the
whole
mormon
church
fabric
to
collapse
if
the
book
of
mormon
had
been
a
fraudulent
production
joseph
smith
and
sidney
rigdon
would
never
have
dared
to
break
with
these
two
important
witnesses
whatever
their
wickedness
might
be
but
the
bold
independent
course
pursued
in
excommunicating
them
when
their
conduct
warranted
the
action
supplies
good
evidence
that
joseph
smith
knew
that
the
existence
of
the
church
did
not
depend
on
the
testimony
of
oliver
cowdery
and
david
whitmer
the
book
of
mormon
being
true
it
would
stand
independent
of
these
witnesses
and
joseph
knew
it
but
the
most
gratifying
part
of
it
is
these
witnesses
to
the
book
of
mormon
though
separated
from
the
church
excommunicated
for
unrighteousness
never
denied
their
testimony
or
changed
it
in
the
least
but
the
fact
of
their
having
uniformly
adhered
to
their
testimony
while
disconnected
with
the
church
doubtless
adds
strength
to
that
testimony
as
they
stand
in
the
light
of
disinterested
witnesses
oliver
cowdery
after
his
excommunication
became
a
wanderer
for
a
number
of
years
unsettled
and
restless
though
following
the
profession
of
the
law
it
was
impossible
for
a
man
who
had
once
tasted
the
glories
of
the
celestial
kingdom
of
god
as
oliver
cowdery
had
to
be
satisfied
with
the
dry
husks
of
the
beggarly
elements
of
the
world
and
hence
after
some
ten
years
of
wandering
outside
the
church
of
christ
he
at
last
found
his
way
back
to
the
fold
of
god
to
the
house
of
his
father
and
begged
to
be
admitted
as
a
humble
member
of
the
church
this
was
in
the
early
part
of
november
before
a
high
council
over
which
elder
orson
hyde
presided
on
that
occasion
oliver
cowdery
said
brethren
for
a
number
of
years
i
have
been
separated
from
you
i
now
desire
to
come
back
i
wish
to
come
humbly
and
be
one
in
your
midst
i
seek
no
station
i
only
wish
to
be
identified
with
you
i
am
out
of
the
church
i
am
not
a
member
of
the
church
but
i
wish
to
become
a
member
of
it
i
wish
to
come
in
at
the
door
i
know
the
door
i
have
not
come
here
to
ask
precedence
i
come
humbly
and
throw
myself
upon
the
decisions
of
this
body
knowing
as
i
do
that
its
decisions
are
right
and
should
be
obeyed
soon
after
this
he
was
he
was
on
his
way
to
join
the
main
body
of
the
church
when
he
stopped
at
kanesville
iowa
where
the
above
occurred
before
continuing
his
journey
west
he
resolved
to
visit
his
wife
friends
the
whitmers
then
living
at
richmond
missouri
and
while
there
he
was
taken
with
an
illness
from
which
he
died
on
the
of
march
in
his
year
according
to
the
testimony
of
phineas
young
who
was
present
at
his
death
his
last
moments
were
spent
in
bearing
testimony
of
the
truth
of
the
gospel
revealed
through
joseph
smith
and
the
power
of
the
holy
priesthood
which
he
had
received
through
his
administration
david
whitmer
never
denied
his
testimony
to
the
truth
of
the
book
of
mormon
through
all
the
years
of
his
separation
from
the
church
but
repeatedly
reaffirmed
it
especially
in
the
closing
years
of
his
life
three
days
previous
to
his
death
which
occurred
on
the
of
january
he
called
his
family
and
a
number
of
his
friends
to
his
bedside
and
turning
to
his
physician
said
buchanan
i
want
you
to
say
whether
or
not
i
am
in
my
right
mind
before
i
give
my
dying
testimony
the
doctor
answered
yes
you
are
in
your
right
mind
for
i
have
just
had
a
conversation
with
you
he
then
addressed
himself
to
all
around
his
bedside
in
these
words
now
you
must
all
be
faithful
in
christ
i
want
to
say
to
you
all
the
bible
and
the
record
of
the
nephites
book
of
mormon
is
true
so
that
you
can
say
that
you
heard
me
bear
my
testimony
on
my
all
be
faithful
in
christ
and
your
reward
will
be
according
to
your
works
god
bless
you
all
my
trust
is
in

forever

was
entirely
exempt
from
the
influence
of
those
false
spirits
who
were
striving
against
me
for
the
mastery
even
some
of
the
twelve
were
so
far
lost
to
their
high
and
responsible
calling
as
to
begin
taking
sides
secretly
with
the
enemy

early

was
organized
it
was
one
of
the
many
banks
which
sprung
up
all
over
the

states
about
that
time
and
which
under
the
current

laws
issued
bank
currency
and
with
hundreds
of

similar
institutions
throughout
the
land
went
down
in
the
financial
maelstrom
which
swept
over
the
country
in
the
latter
part
of
among
those
disaffected
at
kirtland
there
were
some
who
held
the
prophet
responsible
for
the
failure
of
the
safety
society
bank
some
charged
that
they
had
been
given
to
understand
that
the
bank
was
instituted
by
the
will
of
god
and
that
it
would
never
fail
let
men
do
what
they
would
b
the
prophet
disclaimed
having
made
any
such
statement
or
having
authorized
any
one
else
to
make
it
on
the
contrary
he
declared
in
open
conference
held
at
kirtland
on
the
of
september
that
he
had
always
said
that
unless
the
institution
was
conducted
on
righteous
principles
it
would
not
stand

notwithstanding

apostates
in

held
him
responsible
for
its

and
by
early
january
the
spirit
of

became
so
bitter
that
the

joseph
and

had
to

in
flight
in

they
fled
by
night
from

on
horseback
but
subsequently
were
joined
by
their
families
in
wagons
and
thus
made
the
tedious
journey
with
teams
the
weather
was
cold
and
sometimes
they
were
obliged
to
secrete
themselves
in

stopped
at

over
night
with
only
a
partition
wall
between
them
through
which
the

and
his
companion
could
hear
their
oaths

and
imprecations
they
even
went
into
the
room
of
the

looked
upon
them
but
concluded
they
were
not
the
men
they
were
pursuing
part
of
the
time
the

and
sidney
traveled
together

for
greater
security
they
sometimes
traveled
alone
at

separated

when

heard
that
joseph

a

went

so
fluctuating

they
camped
on

at

a

bank

it
is
situated
in

in
a
great
bend
of

the

comes
sweeping
down
from

makes
a
bold

runs
in

to
the
for
some
two

when
it
as
suddenly
makes
another
curve
and
flows
again
to
the
we
have
already
spoken
of
grand
river
as
a
stream
that
has
worn
a
deep
channel
for
itself
and
left
its
banks
precipitous
but
here
at
diahman
that
is
only
true
of
the

as
it
rushed
from

this
height
of
prairie
land
containing
beds
of

not
being
able
to
cut
its
way
through
it
veered
off
to
the
and
left
that
height
of
land
standing
like
a
palisade
that
rises
very
abruptly
from
the
stream
to
a
height
of
from
fifty
to
feet
but
the
summit
of
these
bluffs
is
the
common
level
of
the
high
rolling
prairie
extending
off
in
the
direction
of
far
west
the
bluffs
on
the
north
bank
recede
some
distance
from
the
stream
so
that
the
river
bottom
at
this
point
widens
out
to
a
small
valley
the
bluffs
on
the
north
bank
of
the
river
are
by
no
means
as
steep
as
those
on
the
south
and
are
covered
with
a
heavier
growth
of
timber
a
ridge

spur
runs
out
from

of

approaching

at

is
made
the
termination
of
the
bluff
is
quite
abrupt
and
overlooks
a
considerable
portion
of
the
river
bottom
on
the
brow
of
the
bluff
stood
the
old
stone
altar
which
the
brethren
found
there
when
it
was
first
discovered
according
to
those
who
visited
it
frequently
it
was
about
sixteen
feet
long
by
nine
or
ten
feet
wide
having
its
greatest
extent
north
and
south
the
height
of
the
altar
as
the
brethren
found
it
was
some
two
and
a
half
feet
at
each
end
but
gradually
rising
higher
to
the
center
which
was
between
four
and
five
feet
high
the
whole
surface
being
crowing
such
was
the
altar
at
diahman
when
the
brethren
found
it
now
however
it
is
thrown
down
and
nothing
but
a
mound
of
crumbling
stones
mixed
with
soil
and
a
few
boulders
mark
the
spot
which
is
doubtless
rich
in
historic
events
it
was
here
that
the
patriarchs
associated
with
adam
and
in
his
company
assembled
at
this
altar
to
worship
their
god
here
their
evening
prayers
ascended
to
heaven
in
the
smoke
of
the
burning
sacrifice
and
here
angels
instructed
them
in
heavenly
truths
but
more
of
this
anon
north
of
the
ridge
on
which
the
ruins
of
the
altar
are
found
and
running
parallel
with
it
is
another
ridge
separated
from
the
first
by
a
depression
or
miniature
valley
varying
in
width
from
fifty
to
a
hundred
yards
this
small
valley
with
the
larger
one
through
which
flows
grand
river
is
the
valley
of
three
years
previous
to
the
death
of
adam
he
gathered
the
patriarchs
seth
enos
cainan
mahalaleel
jared
enoch
and
methuselah
together
with
all
their
righteous
posterity
into
this
valley
we
have
described
and
there
gave
them
his
last
blessing
and
even
as
he
blessed
them
the
heavens
were
opened
and
the
lord
appeared
and
in
the
presence
of
their
god
the
children
of
adam
arose
and
blessed
him
and
called
him
michael
the
prince
the
archangel
the
lord
also
blessed
adam
saying
i
have
set
thee
to
be
the
head
a
multitude
of
nations
shall
come
of
thee
and
thou
art
a
prince
over
them
for
ever
so
great
was
the
influence
of
this
double
blessing
upon
adam
that
though
he
was
bowed
down
with
age
under
the
of
the
holy
ghost
he
predicted
what
should
befall
his
posterity
to
their
latest
generations
thus
we
find
the
valley
of
diahman
a
hallowed
spot
made
so
because
of
these
sacred
associations
but
all
the
interest
concerning
diahman
is
not
associated
with
the
past
it
is
connected
with
the
future
as
well
for
it
is
in
this
same
valley
that
the
ancient
of
days
adam
will
come
and
meet
with
his
posterity
when
thousand
thousands
shall
minister
to
him
and
ten
thousand
times
ten
thousand
shall
stand
before
him
here
is
where
the
books
will
be
opened
and
the
judgment
shall
sit
here
too
the
son
of
man
will
appear
to
this
vast
multitude
in
the
clouds
of
heaven
and
coming
to
the
ancient
of
days
shall
give
to
him
dominion
and
glory
and
issue
a
decree
that
all
people
nations
and
languages
shall
serve
and
obey
him
and
his

shall

and

when
smitten

turned
the

we
have
done
it
again

until

are
wearied
of

smitten

tired

proved
the

with

we

suffered

abuse
without

with

and
have
endured
without
resentment
until
this

and
still
their
persecutions
and
violence
do
not
cease
but
from
this
day
and
this
hour
we
will
suffer
it
no
more
we
take
god
and
all
the
holy
angels
to
witness
this

that
we
warn
all

in

that
comes
on

to
disturb
us
it
shall
be
between
us

them
a

of

for
we
will
follow
them
until
the
last
drop
of
their
blood
is
spilled
or
else
they
will
have
to
exterminate
us

we

this
place
we
therefore
take
all
men
to
record
this
day
that
we
proclaim
our
liberty
this
day
as
did
our
fathers
and
we
pledge
this
day
to
one
another
our
fortunes
our
lives
and
our
sacred
honors
to
be
delivered
from
the
persecutions
which
we
have
had
to
endure
for
the
last
nine
years
or
nearly
that
time
neither
will
we
indulge
any
man
or
set
of
men
in
instituting
vexatious
law
suits
against
us
to
cheat
us
out
of
our
rights
if
they
attempt
it
we
say
woe
unto
them
we
this
day
then
proclaim
ourselves
free

it
may
not
be
inappropriate
here
to
break
the
direct
line
of
my
narrative
for
the
purpose
of
noticing
events
that
are
but
indirectly
connected
with
the
missouri
persecutions
and
yet
are
peculiarly
characteristic
of
mormon
movements
the
seventies
that
were
in
kirtland
in
the
spring
of
met
in
the
house
of
the
lord
there
and
discussed
the
best
method
of
removing
the
quorum
to
missouri
it
was
manifest
both
by
vision
and
by
prophecy
that
they
should
go
up
in
a
camp
pitching
their
tents
by
the
way
and
the
liberty
of
going
with
the
camp
was
to
be
extended
to
those
that
were
not
seventies
on
the
condition
that
they
would
comply
with
the
rules
of
the
camp
a
commission
of
seven
all
seventies
was
appointed
to
lead
the
camp
and
there
were
also
appointed
a
chief
engineer
a
historian
and
a
general
treasurer
the
camp
was
divided
in
companies
of
ten
with
a
captain
over
each
company
the
rules
governing
kirtland
camp
as
it
is
called
in
church
history
were
few
and
smack
of
a
primitive
simplicity
the

shall
receive
advice
from
the
counselors
the
commission
of

concerning
his
duties
at

shall
blow

shall
see
that

and

of

and

souls
with

camped
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
south
of
the
lord
house
in
kirtland
on
the
fifth
of
july
and
the
next
day
started
for
missouri
the
journey
was
long
and
tedious
many
difficulties
were
encountered
and
numerous
obstacles
overcome
a
spirit
of
murmuring
was
frequently
manifested
much
sickness
was
in
the
camp
and
because
of
their
disobedience
evil
spirits
plagued
them
by
getting
possession
of
their
bodies
at
times
they
would
camp
by
the
to
rest
their
jaded
teams
when
the
brethren
would
generally
get
a
small
contract
of
work
to
do
such
as
harvesting
a
field
of
grain
building
fences
or
making
road
in
this
way
they
spent
the
summer
in
journeying
to
missouri
where
they
arrived
late
in
autumn
a
company
of
saints
organized
in
a
similar
manner
in
canada
under
the
leadership
of
john
page
in
their
journey
to
missouri
met
with
the
camp
from
kirtland
on
sunday
the
of
august
and
john
page
preached
to
the
kirtland
camp
as
they
passed
through
the
country
they
received
varied
treatment
at
the
hands
of
the
people
at
times
they
were
allowed
to
pass
on
in
peace
and
then
threatened
with
violence
and
at
times
actually
assaulted
their
toils
and
sufferings
their
faithfulness
and
rebellions
their
rejoicings
and
sorrows
their
preaching
the
word
in
the
wilderness
their
hunger
fatigue
sickness
deaths
and
the
final
arrival
of
the
remnants
of
the
camp
in
far
west
and
diahman
would
if
related
in
detail
make
a
long
interesting
chapter
but
we
have
not
space
to
say
more
here
chapter
xxxiv
gallatin
the
sparsely
settled
counties
of
upper
missouri
as
well
as
the
newly
organized
county
of
caldwell
seemed
to
promise
an
asylum
where
the
exiles
from
jackson
and
clay
counties
and
the
gathering
saints
from
the
east
could
find
peace
and
rest
but
the
illusion
was
soon
to
be
dispelled
the
hope
blighted
they
were
to
receive
another
testimony
that
the
church
of
christ
was
still
militant
and
not
triumphant
and
that
the
true
disciple
of
christ
must
endure
patiently
the
fortunes
of
that
warfare
renewed
hostilities
with
the
missourians
began
in
this
way
on
the
of
august
an
election
was
held
at
gallatin
in
daviess
county
and
the
old
settlers
under
the
leadership
of
peniston
made
a
determined
effort
to
prevent
the
mormons
from
voting
some
of
the
bullies
among
the
missourians
persistently
insulted
the
brethren
which
was
endured
patiently
for
a
time
but
when
at
last
a
drunken
rough
one
dick
welding
attempted
to
strike
a
brother
by
the
name
of
samuel
brown
perry
durphy
caught
his
arm
and
this
was
made
an
excuse
by
the
missourians
to
begin
a
general
assault
the
missourians
although
outnumbering
the
brethren
found
themselves
overmatched
and
beat
a
hasty
retreat
to
get
arms
among
those
who
fought
hardest
for
his
rights
as
an
american
citizen
and
in
the
defense
of
his
brethren
was
john
butler
and
as
soon
as
they
left
butler
called
the
brethren
together
and
said
we
are
american
citizens
our
fathers
fought
for
their
liberty
and
we
will
maintain
the
same
principles
here
he
was
interrupted
by
the
county
officials
who
told
the
brethren
that
the
whole
disturbance
was
a
premeditated
thing
to
prevent
them
from
voting
and
requested
them
to
withdraw
as
they
feared
it
might
end
in
bloodshed
by
this
time
the
missourians
began
to
collect
armed
to
the
teeth
and
greatly
reinforced
and
as
the
brethren
were
unarmed
they
retired
to
their
homes
collected
their
families
and
concealed
them
in
the
hazel
thickets
the
rain
fell
in
torrents
through
the
night
the
women
and
children
were
lying
on
the
ground
while
the
men
guarded
them
judge
morin
of
daviess
county
some
two
weeks
before
the
time
of
election
had
told
levi
stewart
and
others
that
there
was
a
movement
on
foot
then
to
prevent
the
mormons
from
voting
and
advised
them
if
they
went
to
the
election
at
gallatin
to
go
armed
prepared
to
assert
their
rights
the
brethren
however
had
not
heeded
the
friendly
warning
and
went
to
the
polls
unarmed
with
the
result
above
stated
the
report
of
the
trouble
at
gallatin
which
reached
far
west
was
very
much
exaggerated
it
stated
that
three
of
the
brethren
had
been
killed
and
were
refused
burial
and
that
the
people
of
daviess
county
were
arming
to
drive
the
saints
from
their
homes
in
diahman
upon
the
reception
of
the
report
the
prophet
joseph
his
brother
hyrum
and
other
leading
men
started
for
the
settlement
of
the
saints
their
company
increasing
on
the
route
by
brethren
living
between
far
west
and
diahman
joining
them
the
company
arrived
at
the
house
of
lyman
wight
and
there
learned
the
truth
in
relation
to
the
gallatin
trouble
the
whole
country
was
in
an
uproar
in
which
ministers
of
the
gospel
and
county
officials
joined
and
by
their
connection
with
it
made
the
disturbance
formidable
the
whole
company
that
had
come
with
joseph
from
far
west
rode
over
to
a
spring
on
the
prairie
a
short
distance
from
wight
house
and
a
committee
called
upon
judge
adam
black
the
justice
of
the
peace
for
that
district
and
for
the
county
to
learn
if
he
justified
the
course
of
the
proceedings
at
gallatin
on
the
part
of
the
old
settlers
to
which
he
replied
he
did
not
as
he
was
a
justice
of
the
peace
they
desired
to
know
if
he
would
administer
the
law
justly
and
not
join
the
mob
the
question
was
put
to
him
because
rumor
had
it
that
he
was
connected
with
the
mob
element
he
replied
that
he
would
administer
the
law
fairly
and
consented
to
give
a
statement
in
writing
to
that
effect
and
also
denied
having
any
connection
with
the
mob
as
this
occurrence
at
black
residence
was
made
the
excuse
for
commencing
those
hostilities
which
terminated
so
disastrously
to
the
saints

them
this
the
day
of
august
adam
black
while
the
was
making
out
this
to
him
weighty
document
black
was
chastising
the
brethren
with
the
valor
of
her
tongue
in
a
manner
that
doubtless
would
have
made
the
ancient
xantippe
green
with
envy
after
securing
this
agreement
of
peace
from
judge
black
the
company
returned
to
wight
where
they
met
some
citizens
from
millport
and
arranged
to
hold
a
conference
the
next
day
at
noon
with
the
principal
men
of
daviess
county
among
those
who
attended
that
meeting
the
day
following
were
joseph
morin
state
john
williams
state
the
clerk
of
the
circuit
court
and
others
those
men
and
the
principal
elders
of
the
church
entered
into
a
solemn
agreement
to
preserve
each
other
rights
and
stand
in
each
other
defense
if
men
in
the
respective
parties
should
do
wrong
they
were
not
to
be
upheld
or
screened
from
justice
by
their
friends
but
must
be
delivered
up
to
be
dealt
with
according
to
law
and
justice
but
like
some
hardened
sinner
who
even
in
penance
will
plan
sins
anew
so
with
the
missourians
while
some
of
their
leading
men
were
entering
into
covenants
of
peace
others
of
them
were
planning
the
destruction
of
the
saints
the
very
day
following
the
agreement
of
peace
referred
to
wm
peniston
who
had
incited
the
mob
disturbance
at
the
gallatin
election
went
before
the
circuit
judge
austin
a
king
and
made
out
a
complaint
against
joseph
smith
lyman
wight
and
others
accusing
them
of
having
surrounded
the
house
of
adam
black
and
under
threats
of
immediate
death
compelled
him
to
sign
a
most
disgraceful
paper
also
that
the
same
men
and
their
followers
had
threatened
to
take
his
life
on
sight
and
the
same
threat
extended
to
others
he
claimed
that
the
body
of
men
following
joseph
smith
numbered
some
five
hundred
that
they
were
armed
and
that
their
actions
were
of
a
highly
insurrectionary
character
and
that
their
object
was
to
intimidate
and
drive
from
the
county
all
the
old
citizens
and
possess
themselves
of
their
lands
or
to
force
such
as
would
not
leave
to
accept
their
measures
and
submit
to
their
dictation
in
the
latter
part
of
the
month
adam
black
himself
swore
out
a
complaint
to
the
same
effect
adding
that
the
mormons
would
not
submit
to
the
law
as
soon
as
it
was
heard
that
joseph
smith
and
a
body
of
followers
had
gone
armed
into
daviess
county
to
inquire
about
their
friends
a
committee
of
ray
county
citizens
came
up
to
far
west
to
inquire
into
the
reasons
of
such
a
movement
a
meeting
was
called
and
a
committee
appointed
to
give
the
committee
from
ray
all
the
information
required
joseph
movements
were
watched
very
closely
on
the
occasion
of
his
returning
from
a
visit
to
a
company
of
saints
camped
on
the
forks
of
grand
river
between
thirty
and
forty
miles
from
far
west
he
and
the
small
company
of
brethren
with
him
were
chased
some
distance
by
a
body
of
armed
men
but
they
escaped
it
was
reported
that
joseph
would
not
submit
to
civil
process
that
he
defied
the
law
a
charge
had
been
trumped
up
in
daviess
county
against
him
for
going
there
in
arms
to
inquire
about
the
gallatin
election
troubles
and
on
the
morning
of
the
of
august
the
sheriff
of
daviess
county
and
judge
morin
called
upon
joseph
and
informed
him
that
they
had
a
writ
for
his
arrest
joseph
expressed
his
willingness
to
be
tried
but
as
the
people
of
daviess
county
were
very
much
though
unjustly
exasperated
at
him
he
wished
to
be
tried
in
his
own
county
and
the
laws
gave
him
that
right
upon
this
insistence
the
sheriff
refused
to
serve
the
warrant
and
he
said
he
would
see
judge
king
about
it
joseph
agreed
to
remain
at
home
until
his
return
which
he
did
on
his
return
the
sheriff
informed
the
prophet
that
he
was
out
of
his
jurisdiction
the
excitement
which
had
been
aroused
however
could
not
be
abated
on
the
contrary
it
spread
into
surrounding
counties
and
its
intensity
increased

into
offense
this
excitement
in

and
surrounding
counties
and
the
indian
difficulties
which
were
threatening
about
the
same
time
induced
governor

a
to
send
an
order
to
david

four
hundred

equipped

to

the
judge
was
notified
of

the
trial
was
postponed
until
the
next
day
to
take
place
at
the
house
of
a
raglin
one
of
the
chief

the
result
of
the
trial
was
that
joseph
and

wight
were
bound
over
in
a
five
hundred
dollar
bond
to
appear
at

next
session
of

said
nothing

but
when

determined
to
proceed
carefully

very
wisely
sent
two

at
its
close
accompanied
him
and
his
party
to

the
information
they
received
convinced
them
that
there
was
no

however
were
very
active
in
moving
from
point
to
point
wherever
there
was
a
threatened
attack
upon
their
people
hearing
that
a
wagon
load
of
arms
and
ammunition
was
from
richmond
to
the
mob
infesting
the
vicinity
of
diahman
captain
wm
allred
took
a
company
of
ten
mounted
men
and
started
to
intercept
the
transport
they
found
the
wagon
broken
down
and
the
boxes
of
guns
concealed
near
the
roadside
in
the
tall
grass
but
no
one
was
in
sight
shortly
after
this
party
had
discovered
the
arms
they
saw
moving
over
the
prairie
from
the
direction
of
the
mob
camp
two
horsemen
and
behind
them
a
third
man
driving
a
team
these
parties
came
up
to
the
broken
down
wagon
and
were
arrested
by
captain
allred
by
virtue
of
a
writ
he
held
for
them
issued
by
the
civil
authorities
of
caldwell
county
the
prisoners
and
the
guns
were
taken
to
far
west
and
after
an
examination
before
albert
petty
justice
of
the
peace
they
were
held
to
bail
for
their
appearance
at
the
next
term
of
the
circuit
court
the
names
of
these
parties
were
j
comer
held
as
principal
and
wm
mchoney
and
allen
miller
as
being
in
the
employ
of
comer
engaged
in
furnishing
a
mob
with
arms
for
an
illegal
purpose
judge
king
was
informed
of
the
arrest
of
these
men
and
his
advice
was
asked
as
to
what
disposal
should
be
made
of
the
prisoners
he
replied
that
the
prisoners
must
be
turned
loose
and
treated
kindly
he
had
no
advice
to
give
about
the
guns
and
was
at
a
loss
to
know
how
to
account
for
them
being
in
the
possession
of
comer
as
they
belonged
to
government
and
had
been
in
the
custody
of
captain
pollard
living
in
the
vicinity
of
richmond
i
have
already
related
how
the
prisoners
were
held
to
bail
the
guns
were
distributed
among
the
brethren
to
be
used
in
a
few
days
afterwards
the
prisoners
were
delivered
up
to
doniphan
and
stands
of
the
firearms
were
also
collected
and
delivered
to
him
the
mob
took
a
number
of
the
brethren
prisoners
and
sent
word
to
far
west
and
other
settlements
that
they
were
torturing
them
in
the
most
inhuman
manner
by
this
means
doubtless
seeking
to
provoke
the
saints
to
some
act
of
cruelty
upon
their
enemies
that
might
fall
into
their
power
and
thus
give
the
mob
an
excuse
for
assaulting
and
driving
the
mormon
community
from
the
state
all
parts
of
the
state
were
flooded
with
the
falsehoods
about
mormon
atrocities
and
cruelties
cruelties
which
never
occurred
a
bitter
prejudice
however
was
manufactured
against
the
saints
and
people
generally
believed
the
mormons
were
capable
of
all
the
crimes
known
to
hardened
sinful
wretches
and
that
they
were
unfit
to
live
in
the
meantime
the
militia
governor
boggs
had
ordered
to
be
held
in
readiness
was
mustered
into
service
under
the
direction
of
doniphan
six
companies
of
fifty
men
each
were
collected
and
armed
from
the
militia
of
clay
county
and
at
once
marched
into
the
vicinity
of
diahman
here
doniphan
found
the
citizens
of
daviess
and
surrounding
counties
to
the
number
of
two
or
three
hundred
under
arms
and
commanded
by
austin
from
carroll
county
they
claimed
to
have
collected
solely
for
the
purpose
of
defending
the
people
of
daviess
county
against
the
mormons
doniphan
read
to
them
the
order
of
his
superior
officer
general
atchison
to
disperse
but
this
they
refused
to
do
i
had
an
interview
said
doniphan
with
austin
and
his
professions
were
all
pacific
but
they
austin
men
still
continued
under
arms
marching
and
counter
marching
the
general
also
visited
the
encampment
of
the
brethren
under
the
command
of
colonel
lyman
wight
doniphan
report
says
we
held
a
conference
with
him
and
he
professed
entire
willingness
to
disband
and
surrender
up
to
me
every
one
of
the
accused
of
crime
and
required
in
return
that
the
hostile
forces
collected
by
the
other
citizens
of
the
county
should
also
disband
as
they
refused
to
obey
the
order
to
disband
the
safety
of
the
brethren
and
their
families
required
that
they
should
continue
under
arms
and
general
doniphan
took
up
a
position
between
the
two
opposing
forces
hoping
that
if
the
parties
were
kept
apart
in
a
few
days
they
would
disband
without
coercion
in
the
course
of
two
or
three
days
general
atchison
arrived
with
a
body
of
militia
from
ray
county
he
at
once
ordered
the
citizens
from
the
surrounding
counties
to
repair
to
their
respective
homes
a
movement
they
began
to
make
with
many
signs
of
reluctance
only
about
one
hundred
of
them
obeyed
the
order
atchison
reported
to
governor
boggs
that
he
had
received
assurance
from
the
mormons
that
all
those
accused
of
a
violation
of
the
laws
would
be
in
for
trial
the
very
day
on
which
his
report
was
dated
the
of
september
and
says
the
report
when
that
is
done
the
troops
under
my
command
will
be
no
longer
required
in
this
county
if
the
citizens
of
other
counties
will
retire
to
their
respective
homes
a
day
or
two
after
this
report
atchison
succeeded
in
disbanding
the
mob
forces
and
the
brethren
against
whom
charges
were
trumped
up
appeared
before
a
court
of
inquiry
and
entered
into
bonds
to
appear
at
the
next
session
of
the
circuit
court
this
much
having
been
accomplished
atchison
thought
it
no
longer
needful
to
keep
his
whole
force
of
militia
in
the
field
hence
he
dismissed
all
his
forces
except
two
companies
which
were
left
in
the
vicinity
under
the
command
of
parks
in
reporting
these
latter
movements
to
the
governor
atchison
says
in
conclusion
the
mormons
of
daviess
county
as
i
stated
in
a
former
report
were
encamped
in
a
town
called
and
they
are
headed
by
lyman
wight
a
bold
brave
skillful
and
i
may
add
a
desperate
man
they
appear
to
be
acting
on
the
defensive
and
i
must
further
add
gave
up
the
offenders
with
a
good
deal
of
promptness
the
arms
taken
by
the
mormons
and
the
prisoners
were
also
given
up
upon
demand
with
cheerfulness
the
forces
then
which
had
been
called
out
by
order
of
general
atchison
were
disbanded
except
the
two
companies
that
were
left
under
the
command
of
general
parks
parks
and
these
men
remained
in
the
vicinity
of
diahman
watching
both
mormons
and
gentiles
assisting
in
serving
civil
process
and
reporting
occasionally
to
his
superior
officers
as
these
reports
come
from
a
source
that
is
other
than
a
mormon
one
he
is
a
witness
to
the
uprightness
of
the
acts
of
the
mormon
people
at
that
time
of
considerable
importance
and
this
must
be
our
excuse
for
inserting
several
extracts
from
his
official
reports
in
a
report
which
parks
made
to
governor
boggs
on
the
of
september
occurs
the
following
whatever
may
have
been
the
disposition
of
the
people
called
mormons
before
our
arrival
here
since
we
have
made
our
appearance
they
have
shown
no
disposition
to
resist
the
law
or
of
hostile
intentions
there
has
been
so
much
prejudice
and
exaggeration
concerned
in
this
matter
that
i
found
things
entirely
different
from
what
i
was
prepared
to
expect
when
we
arrived
here
we
found
a
large
body
of
men
from
the
counties
adjoining
armed
and
in
the
field
for
the
purpose
as
i
learned
of
assisting
the
people
of
this
county
against
the
mormons
without
being
called
out
by
the
proper
authorities
in
the
meantime
a
committee
of
old
citizens
had
agreed
to
meet
with
a
committee
appointed
by
the
saints
in
daviess
county
for
the
purpose
of
making
arrangements
for
either
buying
the
property
of
the
saints
or
of
selling
theirs
to
the
brethren
speaking
of
this
committee
in
a
postscript
to
the
above
report
parks
says
i
received
information
that
if
the
committee
do
not
agree
the
determination
of
the
daviess
county
men
is
to
drive
the
with
powder
and
lead
two
days
later
than
the
date
of
parks
report
general
atchison
wrote
to
the
governor
saying
the
force
under
general
parks
is
deemed
sufficient
to
execute
the
laws
and
keep
the
peace
in
daviess
county
things
are
not
so
bad
in
that
county
as
represented
by
rumor
and
in
fact
from
affidavits
i
have
no
doubt
your
excellency
has
been
deceived
by
the
exaggerated
statements
of
designing
or
half
crazy
men
i
have
found
there
is
no
cause
of
alarm
on
account
of
the
mormons
they
are
not
to
be
feared
they
are
very
much
alarmed
these
statements
accompanied
by
the
former
statements
of
atchison
and
doniphan
which
said
the
mormons
were
only
acting
on
the
defensive
and
had
surrendered
the
arms
they
had
taken
from
the
mob
together
with
the
prisoners
with
promptness
and
cheerfulness
prove
that
the
saints
in
collecting
and
arming
were
merely
acting
in
and
not
with
any
desire
to
outrage
the
laws
or
injure
the
missourians
chapter
xxxvi
de
witt
austin
of
carroll
county
who
had
commanded
the
mob
forces
about
diahman
being
compelled
to
disband
his
forces
at
least
part
of
them
he
esteemed
his
force
insufficient
to
drive
out
the
brethren
from
diahman
so
he
conceived
the
idea
of
striking
a
blow
in
another
quarter
in
the
part
of
carroll
county
about
fifty
miles
of
far
west
and
near
the
point
where
grand
river
empties
into
the
missouri
is
the
little
settlement
called
de
witt
here
in
the
autumn
of
a
number
of
the
saints
were
located
quite
a
number
of
whom
had
come
from
ohio
during
the
summer
of
and
were
still
camped
in
their
wagons
and
tents
it
was
to
this
smaller
and
weaker
settlement
that
the
gallant
austin
lead
the
remainder
of
his
mob
forces
after
about
one
hundred
of
his
original
number
had
returned
to
their
homes
in
obedience
to
the
orders
of
general
atchison
at
various
times
through
the
summer
the
mob
had
threatened
the
saints
in
and
around
de
witt
but
it
was
not
until
the
of
september
that
any
serious
demonstration
of
mob
violence
occurred
on
that
day
about
a
hundred
perhaps
a
hundred
and
fifty
men
rode
into
the
settlement
and
threatened
the
people
with
death
if
they
did
not
agree
at
once
to
leave
the
state
but
after
some
deliberation
they
gave
them
until
the
of
october
in
which
to
make
their
departure
the
action
of
the
mob
was
promptly
reported
to
the
governor
and
he
was
asked
by
the
saints
to
take
such
steps
as
would
put
a
stop
to
all
lawless
proceedings
the
petition
making
this
prayer
was
signed
by
over
fifty
of
the
brethren
living
at
de
witt
but
the
governor
gave
no
heed
to
their
prayers
for
the
suppression
of
lawlessness
the
saints
at
de
witt
of
course
paid
no
attention
to
the
demand
of
the
mob
made
on
the
of
september
that
they
leave
the
state
by
the
first
of
october
so
on
the
of
that
month
early
in
the
morning
about
fifty
men
rode
into
de
witt
and
began
firing
upon
the
peaceful
inhabitants
of
the
place
henry
root
made
out
an
affidavit
to
the
foregoing
effect
and
at
once
went
to
general
parks
with
it
who
was
still
in
the
vicinity
of
diahman
with
his
two
companies
of
militia
leaving
colonel
thompson
in
command
at
diahman
general
parks
at
once
ordered
two
companies
of
militia
under
the
command
of
captains
bogart
and
houston
to
arm
and
equip
as
the
law
directed
with
six
provisions
and
fifty
rounds
of
powder
and
ball
with
these
companies
he
marched
for
de
witt
just
before
leaving
he
sent
a
messenger
to
a
colonel
jones
of
carroll
county
to
call
out
three
companies
of
the
militia
and
join
him
at
carrollton
the
county
seat
of
carroll
county
this
order
however
was
ignored
in
his
report
to
general
atchison
general
parks
says
that
when
he
arrived
at
de
witt
he
found
the
place
surrounded
by
men
to
the
number
of
some
three
hundred
provided
with
a
piece
of
artillery
ready
to
attack
the
mormons
gathered
in
de
witt
but
he
expressed
the
opinion
that
the
mormons
could
beat
austin
even
if
he
had
five
hundred
troops
in
the
meantime
his
own
forces
were
mutinous
and
refused
to
act
against
the
mob
hence
he
had
sent
word
to
general
doniphan
to
raise
companies
from
platte
clay
and
clinton
counties
as
he
had
no
faith
that
troops
ordered
from
livingston
and
other
counties
would
come
during
the
time
that
trouble
was
threatened
at
diahman
which
for
the
time
was
happily
suppressed
by
general
atchison
governor
boggs
in
addition
to
the
militia
ordered
out
under
atchison
doniphan
and
parks
had
directed
general
lucas
of
the
fourth
division
of
the
missouri
militia
to
march
with
four
hundred
men
to
join
general
atchison
at
diahman
orders
similar
in
their
nature
were
issued
to
lewis
bolton
john
clark
and
thomas
grant
but
the
success
of
general
atchison
in
scattering
the
mob
forces
about
diahman
led
to
the
disbanding
of
the
militia
under
the
generals
just
named
this
apparently
was
not
relished
at
all
by
lucas
who
it
will
be
remembered
took
an
active
part
in
connection
with
governor
boggs
against
the
saints
in
the
jackson
county
troubles
hearing
of
the
difficulty
arising
at
de
witt
he
thought
it
another
opportunity
to
strike
a
blow
at
the
defenseless
people
he
before
had
assisted
in
murdering
and
driving
from
their
homes
he
passed
down
the
missouri
river
near
where
de
witt
was
located
about
the
time
the
actual
hostilities
began
there
and
reported
the
situation
to
governor
boggs
and
in
concluding
his
letter
he
says
if
a
fight
has
actually
taken
place
of
which
i
have
no
doubt
it
will
create
excitement
in
the
whole
of
upper
missouri
and
those
base
and
degraded
beings
the
mormons
will
be
exterminated
from
the
face
of
the
earth
it
is
an
unpleasant
state
of
affairs
the
remedy
i
do
not
pretend
to
suggest
to
your
excellency
my
troops
were
only
dismissed
subject
to
further
orders
and
can
be
called
into
the
field
at
an
hour
warning
while
lucas
pretended
in
the
above
not
to
suggest
a
remedy
to
the
governor
he
really
does
so
and
plainly
offers
to
carry
out
the
plan
general
lucas
says
those
base
and
degraded
beings
the
saints
will
be
exterminated
from
the
face
of
the
earth
and
then
follows
that
statement
up
by
saying
that
his
troops
amounting
to
four
hundred
had
only
been
dismissed
subject
to
further
orders
and
could
be
called
out
at
an
hour
warning
this
act
on
the
part
of
lucas
was
in
reality
a
suggestion
to
governor
boggs
to
exterminate
the
saints
and
an
offer
on
his
part
to
do
the
job
if
he
only
had
orders
to
call
out
the
men
he
had
but
a
few
days
before
disbanded
the
circumstance
is
the
more
significant
since
his
covert
suggestion
was
subsequently
acted
upon
by
governor
boggs
the
people
of
chariton
county
were
again
asked
to
assist
against
the
mormons
this
time
to
drive
them
from
de
witt
and
again
the
people
of
that
county
held
a
public
meeting
on
the
question
and
sent
a
committee
of
two
to
inquire
into
the
situation
and
report
as
their
report
is
a
complete
vindication
of
the
action
of
the
saints
in
this
instance
i
make
an
extract
from
it
we
arrived
at
the
place
of
difficulties
on
the
fourth
of
october
and
found
a
large
portion
of
the
citizens
of
carroll
and
adjoining
counties
assembled
near
de
witt
well
armed
we
inquired
into
the
nature
of
the
difficulties
they
said
there
was
a
large
portion
of
the
people
called
mormons
embodied
in
de
witt
from
different
parts
of
the
world
they
are
unwilling
for
them
to
remain
there
which
is
the
cause
of
their
waging
war
against
them
to
use
the
language
they
are
waging
a
war
of
extermination
or
to
remove
them
from
the
said
county
we
also
went
into
de
witt
to
see
the
situation
of
the
mormons
we
found
them
in
the
act
of
defense
begging
for
peace
and
wishing
for
the
civil
authorities
to
repair
there
and
as
early
as
possible
settle
the
difficulties
between
the
parties
hostilities
have
commenced
and
will
continue
until
they
are
stopped
by
the
civil
authorities
as
soon
as
word
was
brought
to
joseph
that
the
saints
were
shut
up
by
mob
forces
in
de
witt
he
at
once
started
for
the
scene
of
the
trouble
to
allay
if
possible
the
excitement
among
the
people
he
had
some
difficulty
in
getting
there
as
the
mob
had
all
the
roads
strongly
guarded
and
allowed
neither
ingress
nor
egress
to
the
place
they
were
actually
besieging
but
by
going
unfrequented
roads
and
through
the
woods
he
arrived
at
the
besieged
town
and
found
the
saints
surrounded
by
a
host
of
their
enemies
with
their
provisions
nearly
exhausted
and
no
prospects
of
obtaining
more
the
first
thing
joseph
did
on
his
arrival
was
to
talk
with
several
gentlemen
of
respectability
and
of
good
standing
in
the
neighborhood
and
who
were
not
connected
with
the
church
but
who
had
witnessed
the
proceedings
of
the
mob
against
the
saints
and
now
offered
to
make
affidavits
respecting
the
treatment
the
saints
had
received
at
the
hands
of
the
mob
forces
and
their
present
perilous
situation
and
further
offered
to
send
a
messenger
with
these
papers
and
lay
the
case
before
the
governor
their
proposition
was
gladly
accepted
the
affidavits
were
made
out
and
a
caldwell
dispatched
at
once
with
them
to
the
governor
instead
of
sending
the
people
of
de
witt
any
hope
of
relief
however
the
governor
said
to
caldwell
quarrel
is
between
the
mormons
and
the
mob
and
they
can
fight
it
this
was
the
death
blow
to
all
hopes
that
had
been
entertained
of
receiving
relief
from
the
governor
when
the
case
should
be
fairly
presented
to
him
following
close
upon
this
answer
that
was
returned
from
the
chief
executive
general
parks
sent
word
to
the
besieged
saints
that
his
troops
under
captain
bogart
had
mutinied
and
in
order
to
prevent
them
joining
the
mob
he
was
under
the
necessity
of
drawing
them
away
this
act
of
course
turned
the
people
of
de
witt
over
to
the
tender
mercy
of
the
mob
led
by
austin
major
ashley
a
member
of
the
state
legislature
and
sashiel
woods
a
presbyterian
minister
the
saints
were
hopelessly
shut
up
in
de
witt
if
their
stock
wandered
outside
of
the
immediate
settlement
it
was
shot
down
by
the
mob
and
if
the
people
went
to
the
outskirts
in
search
of
food
they
too
became
the
targets
of
their
merciless
enemies
provisions
were
exhausted
and
some
of
the
brethren
died
of
exhaustion
and
starvation
while
all
were
worn
out
with
constantly
watching
the
movements
of
their
enemies
in
this
extremity
the
saints
were
advised
by
some
of
the
prominent
mormon
citizens
in
the
vicinity
of
de
witt
to
leave
that
county
and
they
would
be
paid
for
all
their
losses
henry
root
and
david
thomas
having
secured
a
promise
of
the
mob
that
if
the
mormons
would
leave
de
witt
they
should
not
be
molested
while
doing
so
the
saints
were
compelled
to
accept
these
terms
and
a
committee
was
appointed
to
appraise
the
property
of
the
mormons
the
names
of
two
of
this
committee
are
all
that
have
been
preserved
judge
erickson
and
major
florey
the
only
property
that
was
appraised
however
was
the
real
estate
the
personal
property
the
saints
had
lost
and
the
stock
that
had
been
shot
down
by
the
mob
and
upon
which
they
had
fed
was
not
taken
into
account
at
all
the
saints
gathered
up
what
teams
and
wagons
they
had
left
and
placing
the
sick
the
aged
and
infirm
together
with
what
personal
property
they
could
take
with
them
they
left
their
fields
and
their
homes
in
the
hands
of
their
enemies
and
wended
their
slow
way
over
the
prairie
in
the
direction
of
far
west
ever
and
anon
as
they
looked
back
with
mournful
glance
in
the
direction
of
de
witt
they
could
see
the
smoke
ascending
heavenward
from
some
of
their
burning
homes
that
was
a
dreary
march
to
far
west
they
were
continually
harassed
by
gangs
of
the
mob
who
followed
them
and
others
that
they
met
in
going
to
the
appointed
rendezvous
in
the
vicinity
of
de
witt
several
brethren
died
on
the
way
and
had
to
be
buried
without
coffins
under
the
most
sorrowful
circumstances
one
sister
who
had
not
recovered
from
through
the
exposure
consequent
upon
being
compelled
to
leave
a
comfortable
home
died
and
was
buried
in
a
grave
bordering
the
banks
of
a
beautiful
stream
the
company
arrived
among
their
brethren
and
sisters
at
far
west
on
the
of
october
chapter
xxxvii
millport
no
sooner
had
the
saints
departed
from
de
witt
than
the
presbyterian
preacher
woods
called
the
mob
that
had
infested
that
settlement
together
and
in
a
speech
of
frenzied
hate
he
suggested
that
they
proceed
at
once
to
daviess
county
and
assist
their
friends
in
driving
the
mormons
from
their
homes
in
that
county
as
they
had
already
done
in
carroll
county
he
assured
them
the
civil
authorities
would
not
interfere
to
defend
the
mormons
and
they
could
get
possession
of
their
property
just
as
well
as
not
he
reminded
them
that
the
land
sales
would
soon
come
off
and
if
they
could
but
get
rid
of
the
mormons
they
could
secure
all
the
lands
they
would
want
to
appreciate
the
force
of
this
part
of
the
preacher
appeal
to
the
mob
the
reader
must
remember
that
the
whole
country
was
wild
on
land
speculations
and
that
some
of
the
saints
were
badly
tinctured
with
it
as
explained
in
a
previous
chapter
the
speech
had
the
desired
effect
and
forthwith
the
entire
body
with
their
cannon
started
for
daviess
county
while
these
events
were
transpiring
in
carroll
county
cornelius
gilliam
who
it
will
be
remembered
called
upon
zion
camp
at
fishing
river
several
years
before
had
been
engaged
in
raising
a
mob
in
platte
and
clinton
counties
to
accomplish
the
same
object
that
parson
woods
and
his
mob
had
in
view
general
doniphan
learned
of
these
movements
both
on
the
part
of
gilliam
and
woods
and
sent
word
to
joseph
smith
that
a
body
of
eight
hundred
men
were
moving
upon
the
settlement
of
his
people
in
daviess
county
he
gave
orders
for
a
company
of
militia
to
be
raised
at
far
west
and
marched
at
once
into
daviess
county
to
defend
those
who
were
threatened
until
he
could
raise
the
militia
in
clay
and
adjoining
counties
to
put
down
the
insurrection
accordingly
a
company
of
one
hundred
were
gotten
in
readiness
to
march
into
daviess
county
the
command
was
given
to
colonel
hinckle
and
he
started
for
diahman
after
general
parks
had
left
the
vicinity
of
de
witt
with
his
mutinous
militia
he
returned
to
diahman
where
he
had
left
colonel
thompson
in
command
and
resumed
control
of
affairs
in
that
section
the
mob
about
diahman
hearing
of
the
fate
of
de
witt
and
learning
of
the
approach
of
that
mob
and
the
efforts
of
gilliam
in
the
same
direction
became
bolder
and
at
once
began
to
threaten
the
saints
and
burn
some
of
their
houses
and
stacks
of
hay
and
grain
these
depredations
were
committed
chiefly
at
a
place
called
millport
a
short
distance
from
diahman
the
house
of
don
carlos
smith
was
burned
down
after
being
plundered
and
his
wife
with
two
helpless
babes
were
driven
out
into
the
night
she
made
her
way
to
diahman
carrying
her
children
and
having
to
wade
grand
river
where
the
stream
was
waist
deep
the
next
day
general
parks
passed
the
ruins
of
this
house
belonging
to
don
carlos
smith
who
was
then
on
a
mission
in
tennessee
and
it
seemed
to
arouse
within
him
a
just
indignation
he
at
once
went
to
the
house
of
lyman
wight
and
gave
him
orders
to
call
out
his
companies
of
militiamen
wight
holding
a
colonel
commission
in
the
regiment
of
the
missouri
militia
commanded
by
general
parks
and
gave
him
full
authority
to
put
down
mobs
wherever
he
should
find
them
assembled
he
said
he
wished
it
distinctly
understood
that
colonel
wight
had
full
authority
from
him
to
suppress
all
mob
violence
the
militia
that
colonel
wight
called
out
was
divided
into
two
companies
one
company
consisting
of
about
sixty
men
was
placed
under
the
command
of
captain
david
patten
and
the
other
of
about
the
same
number
was
commanded
by
wight
in
person
captain
patten
was
ordered
to
go
to
gallatin
and
disperse
the
mobs
that
were
reported
to
be
in
that
vicinity
while
wight
and
his
company
started
for
millport
when
patten
company
came
in
sight
of
gallatin
he
found
a
body
of
the
mob
about
one
hundred
strong
who
were
amusing
themselves
by
mocking
and
in
various
ways
tantalizing
a
number
of
the
saints
whom
they
had
captured
seeing
the
approach
of
patten
men
and
knowing
the
determination
of
the
leader
the
mob
broke
and
ran
in
the
greatest
confusion
leaving
their
prisoners
behind
them
on
his
march
to
millport
colonel
wight
found
the
whole
country
deserted
by
the
mob
which
had
infested
it
and
their
houses
in
flames
or
in
smoldering
ruins
the
mob
having
learned
that
general
parks
had
ordered
out
wight
companies
of
militia
was
seized
with
sudden
fear
and
swore
vengeance
not
only
upon
the
mormons
but
upon
generals
parks
and
doniphan
as
well
to
accomplish
this
purpose
they
had
loaded
up
their
most
valuable
personal
effects
and
setting
fire
to
their
log
huts
they
sent
runners
throughout
the
state
with
the
lying
report
that
the
mormons
had
riz
and
were
burning
the
houses
destroying
property
and
murdering
the
old
settlers
chapter
xxxviii
crooked
river
that
was
a
cunning
piece
of
diabolism
which
prompted
the
mob
of
daviess
county
to
set
fire
to
their
own
huts
destroy
their
own
property
and
then
charge
the
crime
to
the
saints
it
was
an
act
worthy
of
an
incipient
herod
but
it
was
not
without
a
precedent
in
missouri
two
years
before
that
something
very
similar
occurred
in
mercer
county
just
of
daviess
in
june
of
the
year
the
iowa
indians
then
living
in
joseph
made
a
friendly
hunting
excursion
through
the
northern
part
of
the
state
and
their
line
of
travel
led
them
through
what
was
known
as
the
heatherly
settlement
in
mercer
county
the
heatherlys
who
were
ruffians
of
the
lowest
type
took
advantage
of
the
excitement
produced
by
the
incursion
of
the
indians
and
circulated
a
report
that
they
were
robbing
and
killing
the
whites
and
during
the
excitement
these
wretches
murdered
a
man
by
the
name
of
dunbar
and
another
man
against
whom
they
had
a
grudge
and
then
fled
to
the
settlements
along
the
missouri
river
representing
that
they
were
fleeing
for
their
lives
this
produced
great
excitement
in
the
settlements
in
the
surrounding
counties
the
people
not
knowing
at
what
hour
the
indians
might
be
upon
them
the
militia
was
called
out
for
their
protection
but
it
was
soon
ascertained
that
the
alarm
was
a
false
one
the
heatherlys
were
arrested
tried
for
murder
and
some
of
them
sent
to
the
penitentiary
this
circumstance
occurring
only
two
years
before
and
in
a
county
adjacent
to
daviess
county
doubtless
suggested
the
course
pursued
by
the
mob
in
burning
their
own
houses
chiefly
built
of
logs
and
fleeing
to
all
parts
of
the
state
with
the
report
that
the
mormons
had
done
it
and
were
murdering
and
plundering
the
old
settlers
these
false
rumors
spread
by
the
mob
were
strengthened
in
the
public
ear
by
such
men
as
adam
black
judge
king
of
richmond
and
other
prominent
men
who
were
continually
writing
inflammatory
communications
to
the
governor
the
citizens
of
ray
county
called
a
public
meeting
and
appealed
to
the
governor
to
protect
the
people
of
upper
missouri
from
the
mormons
whom
they
termed
a
fearful
body
of
thieves
and
robbers
it
seemed
as
if
the
very
prince
of
lies
and
all
his
hosts
had
suddenly
broken
loose
and
sought
to
overwhelm
the
saints
with
a
flood
of
falsehood
it
was
at
this
particular
crisis
that
thomas
marsh
the
president
of
the
twelve
apostles
and
orson
hyde
one
of
the
members
of
the
same
quorum
fled
to
richmond
and
there
testified
to
the
most
wicked
falsehoods
calculated
to
bring
destruction
upon
their
former
brethren
thomas
marsh
made
an
affidavit
before
henry
jacobs
a
justice
of
the
peace
at
richmond
of
which
the
following
is
an
extract
they
have
among
them
the
mormons
a
company
consisting
of
all
that
are
considered
true
mormons
called
danites
who
have
taken
an
oath
to
support
the
heads
of
the
church
in
all
things
whether
right
or
wrong
i
have
heard
the
prophet
say
that
he
would
yet
tread
down
his
enemies
and
walk
over
their
dead
bodies
that
if
he
was
not
let
alone
he
would
be
a
second
mohammed
to
this
generation
and
that
he
would
make
it
one
gore
of
blood
from
the
rocky
mountains
to
the
atlantic
ocean
to
this
marsh
swore
and
hyde
corroborated
by
affidavit
saying
that
he
knew
part
of
it
to
be
true
and
he
believed
the
other
a
footnote
a
it
may
be
as
well
to
say
here
that
some
time
after
this
when
the
clouds
of
hatred
that
at
this
time
threatened
the
saints
with
destruction
had
drifted
aside
and
these
men
had
time
to
reflect
upon
the
terrible
wickedness
of
their
action
orson
hyde
in
tears
came
back
to
the
people
he
sought
to
destroy
and
humbly
begged
to
be
restored
to
his
position
and
having
manifested
a
spirit
of
repentance
he
was
received
back
into
his
place
went
on
a
mission
to
jerusalem
and
for
many
years
labored
faithfully
for
the
advancement
of
the
church
thomas
marsh
after
leading
a
vagabond
life
for
years
with
the
brand
of
judas
upon
his
brow
and
the
gnawing
of
the
worm
that
never
dies
at
his
heart
when
the
saints
had
weathered
the
storms
of
persecution
not
only
in
missouri
but
also
in
illinois
as
well
and
their
lives
had
fallen
in
the
pleasant
valleys
of
the
rocky
mountains
he
too
a
mere
wreck
of
his
former
self
weak
and
driveling
and
childish
broken
down
in
health
and
spirits
came
humbly
bending
to
the
people
upon
whom
he
had
sought
to
bring
ruin
and
begged
humbly
begged
the
privilege
of
ending
his
days
in
their
midst
he
arose
in
a
congregation
where
thousands
were
congregated
referred
to
his
wrecked
condition
and
told
them
it
was
the
effect
of
apostasy
and
warned
all
against
walking
in
the
path
which
he
had
trod
to
his
infinite
sorrow
his
life
furnishes
a
sad
page
in
the
history
of
the
saints
he
fell
as
judas
fell
and
as
judas
failed
to
stay
the
work
of
god
in
his
day
so
marsh
failed
to
break
down
god
work
in
these
last
days
he
succeeded
only
in
bringing
upon
himself
the
ruin
and
shame
he
tried
to
bring
upon
the
church
since
in
this
statement
made
by
thomas
marsh
and
orson
hyde
the
danites
are
spoken
of
and
as
much
has
been
said
of
this
organization
and
many
false
statements
made
over
and
over
again
accusing
the
church
of
having
such
an
association
as
described
by
marsh
and
hyde
i
here
give
in
brief
an
account
of
that
organization
so
far
as
the
church
knows
anything
in
relation
to
it
a
doctor
sampson
avard
joined
the
church
a
short
time
previous
to
the
apostasy
of
marsh
and
hyde
he
was
one
of
those
restless
ambitious
men
who
desire
to
become
great
and
lord
it
over
their
fellow
men
possessing
neither
the
intelligence
nor
the
integrity
to
rise
to
positions
of
honor
and
trust
in
the
church
by
open
fair
means
he
resolved
to
become
a
leader
by
craft
and
villainy
he
employed
the
art
of
flattery
in
his
conversations
with
the
brethren
appointed
frequent
meetings
at
his
own
house
which
was
guarded
by
one
or
more
of
his
trusted
associates
who
would
give
him
a
sign
if
any
one
approached
whom
he
had
not
trusted
with
an
air
of
mystery
he
would
intimate
that
he
had
been
appointed
by
the
heads
of
the
church
to
accomplish
some
important
work
of
a
secret
character
and
at
last
put
those
whom
he
had
won
by
his
flattery
under
an
oath
of
eternal
secrecy
not
to
reveal
anything
that
he
should
communicate
to
them
by
these
means
he
continued
to
enlarge
his
band
which
he
named
danites
claiming
of
course
that
it
was
a
very
ancient
order
or
society
he
gave
to
them
certain
secret
signs
by
which
members
of
the
band
could
recognize
each
other
either
day
or
night
he
gave
them
to
understand
that
he
had
authority
from
the
heads
of
the
church
for
what
he
was
about
to
do
he
then
proceeded
to
organize
his
men
into
companies
of
tens
and
fifties
placing
a
captain
over
each
up
to
this
time
avard
had
never
intimated
that
anything
unlawful
or
contrary
to
the
spirit
of
the
gospel
was
to
be
carried
out
but
now
that
he
had
the
companies
organized
and
all
under
an
oath
of
secrecy
he
thought
he
could
with
safety
let
the
mask
fall
after
instructing
the
men
as
to
what
their
duties
were
under
their
several
captains
he
took
the
captains
into
a
secluded
place
and
there
told
them
they
would
soon
be
permitted
to
go
among
the
gentiles
and
take
their
property
as
spoil
and
by
robbing
and
plundering
the
gentiles
they
were
to
waste
them
away
and
with
the
property
thus
confiscated
build
up
the
kingdom
of
god
if
any
of
the
band
were
recognized
by
their
enemies
who
could
harm
them
he
asked
for
said
he
we
will
stand
by
each
other
and
defend
one
another
in
all
things
if
our
enemies
swear
against
us
we
can
swear
also
at
this
point
some
of
the
brethren
expressed
surprise
in
fact
astonishment
but
avard
continued
by
saying
as
the
lord
liveth
i
would
swear
to
a
lie
to
clear
any
of
you
and
if
this
would
not
do
i
would
put
them
or
him
under
the
sand
as
moses
did
the
egyptian
and
if
any
of
us
transgress
we
will
deal
with
him
amongst
ourselves
and
if
any
one
of
this
danite
society
reveals
any
of
these
things
i
will
put
him
where
the
dogs
can
not
bite
him
this
lecture
of
the
doctor
revealed
for
the
first
time
the
true
intent
of
his
designs
and
the
brethren
he
had
duped
suddenly
had
their
eyes
opened
and
they
at
once
revolted
and
manfully
rejected
his
teachings
avard
saw
that
he
had
played
and
lost
so
he
said
they
had
better
let
the
matter
drop
where
it
was
as
soon
as
avard
villainy
was
brought
to
the
knowledge
of
the
president
of
the
church
he
was
promptly
excommunicated
and
was
afterwards
found
making
an
effort
to
become
friends
with
the
mob
and
conspiring
against
the
church
this
is
the
history
of
the
danite
band
which
says
the
prophet
joseph
died
almost
before
it
had
an
existence
and
now
i
return
to
the
main
line
of
my
narrative
captain
bogart
who
it
will
be
remembered
held
a
command
in
the
militia
under
general
parks
both
in
the
operations
about
diahman
and
before
de
witt
and
who
on
one
occasion
manifested
a
determination
to
mutiny
and
join
the
mob
was
one
of
the
bitterest
enemies
the
saints
had
and
the
most
active
of
the
mob
on
the
of
october
he
with
about
forty
of
his
followers
called
at
the
house
of
a
brother
thoret
parsons
who
lived
on
the
east
branch
of
log
creek
southeast
of
far
west
he
warned
parsons
to
leave
by
ten
the
next
day
and
remarked
that
he
expected
to
give
far
west
hell
before
noon
the
next
day
provided
he
was
successful
in
joining
his
forces
with
those
of
niel
gilliam
who
would
camp
that
night
six
miles
west
of
far
west
and
that
he
himself
should
camp
that
night
on
crooked
river
a
messenger
was
dispatched
at
once
with
this
information
to
far
west
and
parsons
followed
the
mob
to
watch
their
movements
the
day
on
which
this
occurred
joseph
holbrook
b
and
a
brother
judith
were
watching
the
movements
of
a
small
detachment
of
men
and
saw
eight
of
them
enter
the
house
of
a
brother
pinkham
where
they
took
three
prisoners
and
four
horses
together
with
some
arms
and
food
and
warned
the
old
gentleman
pinkham
to
leave
the
state
at
once
or
they
would
have
his
d
d
old
scalp
this
detachment
then
started
to
join
bogart
main
company
and
holbrook
and
judith
started
for
far
west
they
arrived
there
near
midnight
and
reported
what
they
had
seen
in
the
vicinity
of
the
mob
encampment
the
blast
of
the
trumpet
and
the
roll
of
the
drum
soon
brought
together
a
large
crowd
of
men
to
the
public
square
men
slept
very
lightly
in
those
days
as
they
had
to
be
constantly
on
hand
to
repel
the
attacks
of
their
enemies
the
men
had
been
assembled
by
order
of
judge
higbee
and
he
requested
hinkle
to
raise
a
company
to
disperse
the
mob
and
rescue
the
prisoners
volunteers
were
called
for
and
in
a
few
minutes
men
had
answered
the
call
and
were
placed
under
the
command
of
david
patten
who
it
will
be
remembered
held
a
commission
in
the
state
militia
he
was
also
a
member
of
the
quorum
of
the
twelve

this

judge
holbrook

of

davis
county

the
company
marched
out
some
distance
from
far
west
where
it
halted
and
the
body
was
divided
into
three
divisions
the
commands
of
which
were
given
to
david
patten
james
durphy
and
charles

the
whole
being
under

direction
of
david

the
march
to
the
scene
of
action
is
thus
described
by
one
of
the
company
the
night
was
dark
the
distant
plains
far
and
near
were
illuminated
with
blazing
fires
immense
columns
of
smoke
were
seen
rising
in
awful
majesty
as
if
the
world
was
on
fire
this
scene
of
grandeur
can
only
be
comprehended
by
those
acquainted
with
scenes
of
prairie
burning
as
the
fire
sweeps
over
millions
of
acres
of
dry
grass
in
the
fall
season
and
leaves
a
smooth
black
surface
divested
of
all
vegetation
the
thousand
meteors
blazing
in
the
distance
like
the
camp
fires
of
some
war
hosts
threw
a
fitful
gleam
of
light
upon
the
distant
sky
which
many
might
have
taken
for
the
aurora
borealis
this
scene
added
to
the
silence
of
midnight
the
rumbling
sounds
of
the
trampling
steeds
over
the
hard
surface
of
the
plain
the
clank
of
the
swords
in
their
scabbards
the
occasional
gleam
of
bright
armor
in
the
flickering
firelight
the
gloom
of
surrounding
darkness
and
the
unknown
destiny
of
the
expedition
or
even
the
people
who
sent
it
forth
all
combined
to
impress
the
mind
with
deep
and
solemn
thoughts
and
to
throw
a
romantic
vision
over
the
imagination
which
is
not
often
experienced
except
in
the
poet

or
in
the
wild
imagery

the
mob
were
encamped
in
a
bend
of
crooked
river
near
the
line
of
caldwell
and
ray
counties
and
i
should
judge
all
of
fifteen
miles
directly
south
of
far
west
the
stream
here
lies
imbedded
in
a
deep
ravine
in
fact
this
may
be
said
of
all
the
streams
in
this
part
of
missouri
there
has
been
but
little
disturbance
of
the
earth
crust
in
this
locality
and
the
streams
having
run
in
their
present
course
for
ages
perhaps
ever
since
our
father
adam
and
the
patriarchs
dwelt
in
the
land
have
worn
their
channels
deep
at
any
rate
at
the
place
where
the
mob
was
camped
and
which
old
settlers
pointed
out
to
me
as
bogart
battle
field
the
stream
lies
in
the
bottom
of
a
deep
ravine
the
sides
of
which
are
quite
steep
and
covered
with
a
heavy
growth
of
underbrush
and
timber
a
dugway
road
has
been
cut
on
the
north
side
of
the
ravine
leading
down
to
a
point
where
the
stream
is
fordable
it
is
just
above
this
ford
where
bogart
and
his
men
were
encamped
in
a
little
bottom
immediately
on
the
bank
of
the
river
when
the
brethren
from
far
west
were
within
two
or
three
miles
of
this
encampment
they
dismounted
and
leaving
their
horses
in
the
care
of
a
part
of
their
company
the
rest
proceeded
on
foot
to
the
brow
of
the
hill
under
which
the
mob
was
encamped
it
must
be
remembered
that
captain
patten
did
not
know
the
exact
locality
of
the
mob
but
supposed
they
had
camped
somewhere
about
the
ford
of
the
river
near
the
brow
of
the
hill
the
companies
separated
patten
division
going
to
the
right
rich
to
the
left
and
durphy
between
them
they
were
proceeding
along
silently
when
suddenly
the
stillness
was
broken
by
some
one
exclaiming
who
comes
there
followed
instantly
by
the
sharp
report
of
a
rifle
and
a
young
man
of
the
name
of
patrick
reeled
from
the
ranks
and
fell
mortally
wounded
captain
patten
ordered
a
charge
down
the
hillside
upon
the
mob
below
which
was
promptly
obeyed
the
mob
left
their
encampment
and
formed
in
a
line
under
the
bank
of
the
river
patten
men
formed
in
a
line
facing
them
and
the
mob
opened
fire
which
was
promptly
answered
by
the
brethren
and
then
followed
a
moment
silence
which
was
broken
by
rich
calling
the
watchwords
god
and
liberty
patten
ordered
a
second
charge
upon
the
enemy
and
then
the
fight
was
hand
to
hand
the
fight
however
was
but
of
short
duration
the
mob
soon
began
leaping
into
the
stream
and
making
for
the
other
side
the
late
judge
holbrook
of
davis
county
utah
was
struck
at
by
a
fierce
missourian
with
a
sword
but
by
throwing
up
his
left
arm
he
saved
his
head
and
before
the
mobber
could
recover
himself
the
judge
had
cut
him
down
two
of
the
hindmost
men
of
the
mob
were
pursued
by
captains
patten
and
rich
the
one
followed
by
patten
suddenly
wheeled
round
and
shot
him
in
the
bowels
and
he
fell
mortally
wounded
gideon
carter
face
was
so
literally
shot
to
pieces
that
he
was
almost
beyond
recognition
several
others
were
wounded
in
this
engagement
about
nine
i
think
but
they
recovered
the
mob
had
the
advantage
of
position
in
the
engagement
as
they
formed
under
the
bank
of
the
river
which
answered
all
the
purposes
of
a
breastwork
it
will
be
remembered
too
that
it
was
not
yet
daylight
the
dawn
was
only
just
breaking
in
the
east
when
the
fight
began
the
mob
in
their
flight
left
their
horses
and
all
their
camp
utensils
these
the
victors
took
charge
of
and
making
litters
on
which
to
carry
their
wounded
and
dying
they
started
on
the
return
to
far
west
several
miles
from
far
west
the
mournful
train
was
met
by
a
number
of
the
brethren
among
whom
was
the
prophet
joseph
and
his
brother
hyrum
and
the
wife
of
captain
patten
tender
hands
had
carried
him
on
a
litter
from
the
battle
field
but
he
suffered
excruciating
pains
and
asked
to
be
laid
down
by
the
wayside
that
he
might
die
he
was
taken
to
the
house
of
a
brother
winchester
about
three
miles
from
far
west
where
he
died
that
night
i
need
not
dwell
upon
the
heartrending
sorrow
of
the
wife
at
the
loss
of
a
noble
husband
or
the
grief
of
the
whole
people
who
mourned
the
departure
of
a
great
and
good
man
and
one
of
the
leading
spirits
in
these
last
days
he
died
full
of
faith
having
done
as
he
often
said
he
would
do
if
need
were
lay
down
his
life
for
his
friends
just
before
he
breathed
his
last
he
said
to
his
wife
whatever
you
do
else
o
do
not
deny
the
faith
young
died
shortly
afterwards
and
they
were
buried
together
with
military
honors
the
body
of
gideon
carter
was
afterwards
brought
up
from
the
battle
ground
and
interred
at
far
west
the
loss
of
the
mob
has
never
been
correctly
ascertained
but
at
the
time
they
scattered
before
the
impetuous
charge
of
patten
men
each
one
supposed
he
was
the
only
survivor
left
to
tell
the
tale
of
the
destruction
this
battle
on
crooked
river
though
perfectly
justifiable
on
the
part
of
the
saints
was
made
the
excuse
for
raising
armies
against
them
for
their
destruction
the
following
inflammatory
and
untruthful
message
was
sent
to
the
governor
as
a
report
of
what
we
have
already
related
sir
we
were
informed
last
night
by
an
express
from
ray
county
that
captain
bogart
and
all
his
company
amounting
to
between
fifty
and
sixty
men
were
massacred
at
buncombe
twelve
miles
north
of
richmond
except
three
this
statement
you
may
rely
on
as
being
true
and
last
night
they
expected
richmond
to
be
laid
in
ashes
this
morning
we
could
distinctly
hear
cannon
and
we
knew
the
mormons
had
one
in
their
possession
richmond
is
about
miles
west
of
this
place
on
a
straight
line
we
know
not
the
hour
or
minute
we
shall
be
laid
in
ashes
our
county
is
ruined
for
god
sake
give
us
assistance
as
soon
as
possible

joseph
dickson
woods
will
be
remembered
as
the
presbyterian
preacher
who
after
the
saints
were
compelled
to
leave
de
witt
called
the
mob
which
had
infested
that
place
and
urged
them
to
hasten
to
the
assistance
of
their
friends
in
daviess
county
to
drive
the
mormons
away
from
their
settlement
at
diahman
that
they
might
gain
possession
of
their
lands
these
men
say
they
distinctly
heard
cannon
and
they
knew
the
mormons
had
one
yet
these
men
were
miles
from
where
the
engagement
on
crooked
river
occurred
and
no
cannon
was
used
and
the
one
in
possession
of
the
saints
was
only

these
mobbers
said
joseph
must
have
had
very
acute
ears
so
much
for
the
lies
of
a
priest
of
this
world
one
of
bogart
men
fled
to
richmond
and
reported
that
ten
of
his
comrades
had
been
killed
and
the
rest
taken
prisoners
after
many
of
them
had
been
wounded
and
he
said
it
was
the
intention
of
the
mormon
banditti
that
night
to
sack
and
burn
richmond
upon
the
reception
of
this
lying
report
morehead
was
dispatched
from
richmond
to
lexington
a
town
located
on
the
south
bank
of
the
missouri
on
the
high
bluffs
overlooking
the
river
and
only
about
eight
miles
south
of
richmond
he
begged
the
people
of
that
town
to
come
to
the
assistance
of
richmond
and
they
responded
by
sending
one
hundred
well
armed
and
according
to
ryland
daring
men
the
most
effective
our
county
can
boast
of
an
express
was
sent
from
lexington
to
amos
rees
and
wiley
williams
of
jackson
county
then
en
route
for
the
city
of
jefferson
ordering
them
to
hurry
on
to
the
city
of
jefferson
imparting
correct
information
to
the
public
as
they
went
along
and
to
send
one
of
their
party
into
cooper
howard
and
boone
counties
in
order
that
volunteers
might
be
getting
ready
to
flock
to
the
scene
of
trouble
as
soon
as
possible
the
letter
said
they
the
volunteers
before
alluded
to
must
make
haste
and
put
a
stop
to
the
devastation
which
is
menaced
by
these
infuriated
fanatics
and
they
go
prepared
and
with
a
full
determination
to
exterminate
or
expel
them
from
the
state
en
masse
the

are
mine
and
i
use
them
because
it
was
upon
the
strength
of
this
message
that
governor
boggs
afterwards
issued
his
celebrated
exterminating
order
and
i
pause
here
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
these
men
wiley
williams
and
amos
rees
had
started
for
jefferson
city
as
special
messengers
to
the
governor
to
secure
the
banishment
of
the
saints
from
the
state
of
missouri
these
untruthful
reports
of
the
trouble
on
crooked
river
were
favorable
to
their
cause
and
an
express
was
sent
after
them
to
add
this
falsehood
to
those
with
which
they
were
already
laden
and
to
wish
them
god
speed
in
their
murderous
affairs
we
need
not
say
the
mormons
had
not
so
much
as
thought
of
going
to
richmond
or
acting
otherwise
than
on
the
defensive
chapter
xxxix
exterminating
order
of
governor
boggs
in
the
meantime
the
messengers
from
those
parties
who
had
burned
their
own
homes
and
destroyed
their
own
property
at
millport
had
reached
jefferson
city
and
poured
into
the
willing
ears
of
the
executive
the
villainous
falsehoods
that
the
mormons
with
an
armed
force
had
expelled
the
old
settlers
from
daviess
county
pillaged
and
burned
their
dwellings
driven
off
their
stock
and
destroyed
their
crops
they
also
said
that
millport
and
gallatin
were
in
ashes
and
that
all
the
records
of
the
county
were
destroyed
upon
the
reception
of
this
batch
of
falsehoods
and
an
application
from
these
people
to
be
restored
to
their
homes
and
protected
in
them
governor
boggs
set
himself
vigorously
at
work
calling
out
militia
forces
to
accomplish
this
object
one
can
not
help
pausing
a
moment
to
notice
the
difference
in
the
action
of
the
state
authorities
in
two
cases
that
would
have
been
just
alike
provided
the
report
of
those
parties
who
fled
from
daviess
county
by
the
light
of
their
burning
homes
had
been
true
in
the
saints
were
driven
by
brute
force
and
under
circumstances
the
most
distressing
from
their
possessions
in
jackson
county
and
not
only
was
their
property
destroyed
but
quite
a
number
of
them
were
killed
while
the
number
that
was
exiled
amounted
to
twelve
hundred
the
state
authorities
had
the
fullest
evidence
of
these
outrages
in
fact
the
very
man
who
at
the
time
of
the
daviess
county
troubles
was
governor
of
the
state
was
on
the
ground
and
knew
of
all
the
circumstances
of
cruelty
and
outrage
but
when
those
things
came
before
the
state
authorities
it
took
more
than
two
whole
years
of
correspondence
to
come
to
an
understanding
of
what
could
and
should
be
done
and
then
the
decision
was
that
the
exiles
would
do
well
to
move
still
further
on
in
fact
get
entirely
away
from
that
section
of
the
country
where
they
had
made
their
homes
as
the
prejudices
of
the
people
were
set
against
them
and
the
popular
sentiment
in
this
country
was
dei
but
now
when
a
mere
rumor
comes
that
the
mormons
have
been
guilty
of
inflicting
upon
the
missourians
the
outrages
which
aforetime
had
been
perpetrated
against
them
there
is
no
halting
on
the
part
of
the
authorities
but
on
the
contrary
the
most
vigorous
efforts
are
put
forth
to
punish
the
reputed
offenders
and
reinstate
the
supposed
exiles
governor
boggs
then
began
his
efforts
to
restore
these
reputed
exiles
to
their
homes
he
sent
an
order
to
general
john
clark
of
the
first
division
of
missouri
militia
directing
him
to
raise
two
thousand
men
from
the
first
fourth
fifth
sixth
and
twelfth
divisions
of
the
militia
to
be
mounted
and
armed
as
the
law
directs
provided
with
rations
for
fifteen
days
and
to
rendezvous
at
fayette
in
howard
county
about
eighty
miles
southeast
of
far
west
by
the
third
of
november
this
order
was
dated
the
of
october
the
next
day
however
amos
rees
and
wiley
williams
arrived
in
jefferson
city
with
their
false
report
of
the
battle
on
crooked
river
and
governor
boggs
changed
his
orders
to
general
clark
the
same
day
this
letter
is
exterminating
order
he
said
to
general
clark
since
the
order
of
the
morning
to
you
i
have
received
by
amos
rees
and
wiley
williams
one
of
my
aids
information
of
the
most
appalling
character
which
changes
the
whole
face
of
things
and
places
the
mormons
in
the
attitude
of
open
and
avowed
defiance
of
the
laws
and
of
having
made
open
war
upon
the
people
of
this
state
your
orders
are
therefore
to
hasten
your
operations
and
endeavor
to
reach
richmond
in
ray
county
with
all
possible
speed
the
mormons
must
be
treated
as
enemies
and
be
or
driven
from
the
state
if
necessary
for
the
public
good
their
outrages
are
beyond
description
if
you
can
increase
your
force
you
are
authorized
to
do
so
to
any
extent
you
may
think
necessary
the
governor
also
ordered
major
general
wallock
of
marion
county
to
raise
five
hundred
men
and
join
general
doniphan
of
clay
county
who
had
been
directed
to
raise
a
like
number
of
men
and
together
they
were
to
proceed
to
daviess
county
to
cut
off
the
retreat
of
the
mormons
to
the
north
general
parks
had
been
ordered
to
raise
four
hundred
men
and
join
clark
at
richmond
and
thus
the
campaign
was
planned
the
troops
were
not
to
reinstate
the
supposed
exiles
of
daviess
county
in
their
homes
and
protect
them
but
they
were
to
operate
directly
against
the
mormons
in
fact
make
war
upon
them
exterminate
them
or
drive
them
from
the
state
up
to
this
time
major
general
atchison
had
apparently
exercised
his
influence
counseling
moderation
in
dealing
with
the
mormons
he
was
a
resident
of
clay
county
when
the
saints
were
driven
into
that
county
from
jackson
he
with
general
doniphan
and
amos
rees
had
acted
as
counsel
for
the
exiles
and
had
seen
the
doors
of
the
temples
of
justice
closed
in
their
faces
by
mob
violence
and
all
redress
denied
them
he
was
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
which
led
to
their
removal
from
clay
county
to
the
unsettled
prairies
of
what
afterwards
became
caldwell
county
he
knew
how
deep
and
unreasonable
the
prejudices
were
against
the
saints
can
it
be
possible
that
he
did
not
know
how
utterly
unjustifiable
the
present
movement
against
them
was
whether
he
was
blinded
by
the
false
reports
about
millport
and
gallatin
and
crooked
river
or
whether
his
courage
faltered
and
he
became
afraid
longer
to
defend
a
people
against
whom
every
man
hand
was
raised
i
can
not
now
determine
but
one
or
the
other
must
have
been
the
case
for
i
find
him
joining
with
lucas
in
the
following
communication
to
governor
boggs
sir
from
late
outrages
committed
by
the
mormons
civil
war
is
inevitable
they
have
set
the
laws
of
the
country
at
defiance
and
are
in
open
rebellion
we
have
about
two
thousand
men
under
arms
to
keep
them
in
check
the
presence
of
the
commander
in
chief
is
deemed
absolutely
necessary
and
we
most
respectfully
urge
that
your
excellency
be
at
the
seat
of
as
soon
as
possible
your
most
obedient
etc

div
general
atchison
however
was
afterwards
dismounted
to
use
a
word
of
general
doniphan
in
relating
the
incident
and
sent
back
to
liberty
in
clay
county
by
special
order
of
governor
boggs
on
the
ground
that
he
was
inclined
to
be
too
merciful
to
the
mormons
so
that
he
was
not
active
in
the
operations
about
far
west
but
how
he
could
consent
to
join
with
lucas
in
sending
such
an
untruthful
and
infamous
report
to
the
governor
about
the
situation
in
upper
missouri
is
difficult
to
determine
the
saints
had
not
set
the
laws
at
defiance
nor
were
they
in
open
rebellion
but
when
all
the
officers
of
the
law
refused
to
hear
their
complaints
and
both
civil
and
military
authority
delivered
them
into
the
hands
of
merciless
mobs
to
be
plundered
and
outraged
at
their
brutal
pleasure
and
all
petitions
for
protection
at
the
hands
of
the
governor
had
been
answered
with
it
is
a
quarrel
between
the
mormons
and
the
mob
and
they
must
fight
it
out
what
was
left
for
them
to
do
but
to
arm
themselves
and
stand
in
defense
of
their
homes
and
families
it
is
not
admitted
in
the
above
that
the
saints
had
defied
the
laws
of
the
country
for
it
was
not
so
the
movement
on
gallatin
by
captain
patten
and
that
on
millport
by
colonel
wight
was
ordered
by
general
parks
who
called
upon
colonel
wight
to
take
command
of
his
company
of
men
when
the
militia
under
parks
command
mutinied
and
disperse

were

they
were

destroyed

what

in

by

the
expedition
to

was
ordered
by
judge
higbee
the
first
judge
in
caldwell
county
and
the
highest
civil
authority
in
far

and
was
undertaken
for
the
purpose
of
dispersing
a
mob
which
had
entered
the
house
of
a
peaceable
citizen
one
pinkham
and
carried
off

people
prisoners
four
horses
and
other
property
and
who
had
threatened
to
give

before
noon
the

who
will
be

as
active

which

those

was
in

raising

to
carry
out
the

of

boggs
in
addition
to
these
preparations
for
the
destruction
of
the
saints
in
the
counties
immediately
surrounding
caldwell
there
was
a
general
uprising
of
the
old
settlers
under
no
particular
leadership
but
roaming
through
the
scattered
settlements
of
the
saints
in
small
bands
murdering
stealing
stock
whipping
the
men
and
driving
the
women
and
children
from
their
homes
in
fact
the
whole
country
surrounding
far
west
was
infested
with
a
merciless
banditti
which
daily
were
guilty
of
the
most
atrocious
deeds
of
cruelty
the
saints
living
in
a
scattered
condition
over
the
prairies
who
were
fortunate
enough
to
escape
with
their
lives
came
running
into
far
west
at
all
times
of
the
day
and
night
white
with
fear
let
is
here
be
said
that
the
prophet
joseph
and
counseled
his
people
to
settle
in
villages
and
have
their
farms
on
the
outskirts
thereof
after
the
pattern
as
far
as
circumstances
would
permit
of
the
plan
given
by
revelation
for
building
up
the
city
of
zion
described
in
a
former
chapter
of
this
volume
he
had
urged
in
addition
to
the
improved
opportunities
this
plan
would
give
them
for
educating
their
children
that
they
would
be
in
a
better
condition
to
defend
themselves
against
their
enemies
but
the
saints
at
least
many
of
them
would
not
hearken
to
this
advice
now
however
that
the
enemy
was
upon
them
when
it
was
too
late
for
them
to
profit
by
it
they
could
see
the
wisdom
of
it
it
was
one
of
these
marauding
bands
under
the
leadership
of
nehemiah
comstock
which
was
guilty
of
a
fiendish
massacre
at
haun
mill
on
the
thirtieth
of
october
haun
mill
was
between
ten
and
twelve
miles
nearly
due
east
of
far
west
on
the
south
bank
of
shoal
creek
which
takes
a
meandering
course
though
in
the
main
flowing
east
and
finally
empties
into
grand
river
all
told
there
were
about
thirty
families
of
the
saints
located
at
haun
mill
several
of
which
had
just
recently
arrived
from
the
eastern
states
and
were
camped
in
their
wagons
and
tents
behind
an
old
blacksmith
shop
adjacent
to
the
mill
the
banks
of
the
stream
were
lined
with
a
growth
of
scattered
trees
and
an
undergrowth
of
hazel
and
other
brush
while
back
from
the
banks
is
the
rather
sharp
rolling
prairie
common
to
that
part
of
missouri
this
little
body
of
saints
had
been
threatened
by
mobs
for
some
time
and
were
therefore
on
their
guard
on
the
of
october
however
colonel
jennings
of
livingston
county
whose
band
of
mobbers
had
been
most
menacing
to
the
peace
and
safety
of
the
saints
sent
one
of
his
men
to
the
settlement
to
make
a
treaty
of
peace
this
proposition
of
peace
was
gladly
accepted
by
the
saints
in
fact
it
was
what
they
most
devoutly
prayed
for
there
was
to
be
mutual
forbearance
and
each
party
was
to
exert
itself
to
the
extent
of
its
influence
to
prevent
further
hostilities
there
were
other
mobs
collecting
in
the
vicinity
however
who
were
not
affected
by
this
agreement
of
peace
entered
into
by
the
saints
and
colonel
livingston
one
particularly
on
grand
river
at
william
mann
residence
hence
the
brethren
in
the
little
settlement
on
shoal
creek
remained
under
arms
the
thirtieth
of
october
the
day
on
which
the
fearful
tragedy
occurred
is
said
by
some
of
the
survivors
to
have
been
a
most
beautiful
one
one
of
those
days
in
when
smoky
mists
hang
about
the
horizon
the
sure
sign
of
the
indian
summer
when
the
sun
shines
with
all
the
brightness
but
without
the
scorching
heat
of
august
when
the
gentle
breeze
rustles
through
the
ripened
corn
and
softly
stirs
the
leaves
of
the
forests
that
have
been
kissed
by
the
early
frosts
and
autumn
sun
to
purple
and
gold
and
all
the
shades
and
tints
known
to
the
practiced
eye
of
the
artist
when
the
sinking
sun
paints
the
heavens
with
new
glories
and
when
hill
and
plain
stream
and
sky
forest
and
field
all
reflect
the
fullness
of
beauties
oh
is
it
not
passing
strange
that
one
of
god
fairest
days
should
be
made
to
look
upon
so
foul
a
deed
as
that
committed
at
mill
the
merry
laughter
of
the
children
as
they
played
upon
the
banks
of
shoal
creek
mingled
with
the
snatches
of
songs
the
mothers
sang
as
they
went
about
their
domestic
employments
made
sweet
music
to
the
fathers
engaged
in
gathering
the
crops
or
guarding
the
mill
in
their
neighborhood
all
apparently
was
peace
and
no
premonitory
shuddering
warned
the
saints
of
their
approaching
fate
it
burst
upon
them
with
all
the
suddenness
of
a
clap
of
thunder
from
a
cloudless
sky
the
sun
had
sunken
more
than
halfway
down
the
western
sky
when
some
of
those
on
guard
saw
a
large
body
of
armed
and
mounted
men
approaching
the
mill
at
full
speed
they
came
through
the
scattering
timber
on
the
bank
of
the
creek
to
the
edge
of
the
prairie
where
they
formed
themselves
in
a
three
square
position
with
a
vanguard
david
evans
ran
out
to
meet
them
swinging
his
hat
and
crying
peace
peace
but
there
was
no
peace
the
saints
by
this
time
were
in
the
wildest
state
of
excitement
and
running
in
every
direction
many
of
the
men
taking
refuge
in
an
old
blacksmith
shop
not
far
from
the
mill
the
leader
of
the
mob
numbering
two
hundred
and
forty
fired
his
gun
and
after
a
pause
of
a
few
seconds
about
a
hundred
shots
were
fired
into
the
old
blacksmith
shop
and
at
those
fleeing
for
the
protection
of
the
woods
the
mob
then
rode
up
to
the
shop
and
fired
through
the
space
between
the
logs
until
as
they
thought
all
had
been
killed
or
mortally
wounded
they
then
entered
and
among
the
dead
and
dying
found
sardius
smith
a
lad
about
twelve
years
old
who
in
his
fear
had
crawled
under
the
bellows
for
safety
he
was
dragged
from
his
place
of
concealment
by
a
glaze
who
placed
the
muzzle
of
his
gun
near
the
boy
head
and
literally
shot
off
the
top
of
it
the
inhuman
wretch
afterwards
shamelessly
boasted
of
his
damning
deed
his
brother
alma
a
boy
of
eight
summers
was
shot
through
the
hip
he
had
seen
his
father
and
brother
shot
down
and
fearing
if
he
moved
the
heartless
wretches
would

nursed

thomas
mcbride
an
old
gray
haired
veteran
of
the
american
revolution
was
met
by
a
number
of
the
mob
in
front
of
haun
house
the
old
man
trembling
with
age
rather
than
from
fear
surrendered
his
gun
saying
spare
my
life
i
am
a
revolutionary
soldier
but
the
inhuman
wretch
to
whom
he
made
this
simple
pathetic
appeal
sufficient
to
have
moved
adamantine
hearts
shot
the
veteran
down
with
his
own
gun
and
then
a
rogers
of
daviess
county
fell
upon
him
and
hacked
him
to
pieces
with
an
old
corn
cutter
and
there
lay
the
veteran
soldier
of
the
revolution
covered
with
a
score
of
unsightly
wounds
either
of
which
alone
had
been
fatal
his
brains
oozing
from
his
cracked
skull
and
his
white
hairs
crimsoned
with
his
gore
oh
a
hard
fate
to
overtake
one
of
that
noble
band
who
gave
the
best
years
of
his
life
to
his
country
service
that
liberty
might
survive
oppression
as
night
drew
her
sable
mantle
over
the
ghastly
scene
about
mill
those
who
had
escaped
to
the
woods
returned
to
learn
the
fate
of
their
friends
i
need
not
dwell
upon
the
horrors
of
that
awful
night
in
which
wives
with
bursting
hearts
sought
for
their
husbands
and
mothers
searched
for
their
sons
among
the
mangled
bodies
of
the
dead
nor
need
i
pause
to
relate
in
detail
the
sights
revealed
by
the
morning
light
according
to
the
statement
of
the
leaders
of
the
mob
they
had
fired
seven
rounds
each
making
in
all
some
sixteen
hundred
shots
fired
at
a
company
in
which
there
were
not
more
than
thirty
men
nineteen
of
the
men
and
boys
were
killed
outright
in
this
inhuman
butchery
and
some
twelve
to
fifteen
were
wounded
more
or
less
severely
the
few
men
who
escaped
with
their
lives
the
following
day
carried
the
bodies
of
the
slain
to
an
old
vault
which
had
been
dug
for
a
well
and
there
the
butchered
were
interred
in
haste
as
those
performing
these
sad
offices
were
under
fear
every
moment
that
the
mob
would
return
to
massacre
the
survivors
of
the
tragedy
of
the
day
before
this
haun
mill
butchery
may
very
properly
be
regarded
as
the
first
fruits
of
governor
boggs
exterminating
order
on
the
of
october
colonel
jennings
of
livingston
county
had
entered
into
a
treaty
of
peace
with
the
saints
at
haun
mill
and
each
party
agreed
to
use
whatever
of
influence
it
possessed
for
peace
and
while
we
can
not
learn
whether
that
same
colonel
was
in
the
company
which
did
the
killing
or
not
still
it
is
known
that
a
few
days
after
the
massacre
he
in
company
with
other
leading
men
in
upper
missouri
among
whom
was
ashby
member
of
the
state
legislature
from
chariton
went
about
threatening
the
lives
of
the
survivors
stealing
their
property
laying
waste
their
crops
and
running
off
their
stock
my
own
view
of
the
circumstances
is
that
after
the
treaty
of
peace
entered
into
on
the
colonel
jennings
men
with
other
mob
forces
heard
of
the
exterminating
order
of
governor
boggs
and
gathered
together
under
the
leadership
of
comstock
and
undertook
to
carry
out
the
monstrous
edict
that
was
worthy
only
of
a

caligula
or
a
domitian
chapter
xli
the
betrayal
of
far
west
in
the
meantime
the
mob
forces
called
the
governor
troops
had
gathered
about
far
west
to
the
number
of
two
thousand
two
hundred
men
armed
and
equipped
for
war
the
main
body
of
these
forces
had
marched
from
richmond
under
the
command
of
major
general
samuel
lucas
starting
on
the
of
october
the
following
day
he
was
joined
by
the
forces
of
general
doniphan
at
the
ford
of
log
creek
not
far
from
far
west
here
they
received
the
exterminating
order
of
governor
boggs
this
order
made
no
provisions
for
the
protection
of
the
innocent
the
mormons
were
either
to
be
exterminated
or
driven
from
the
state
regardless
of
their
guilt
or
innocence
as
individuals
on
the
morning
of
the
the
citizens
of
far
west
had
been
informed
of
the
approach
of
large
bodies
of
armed
men
from
the
south
and
sent
out
a
company
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
of
their
number
to
learn
the
character
of
these
forces
whether
they
were
friendly
or
otherwise
the
scouting
party
was
soon
convinced
that
the
intentions
of
the
approaching
forces
were
hostile
and
found
some
difficulty
themselves
in
returning
to
far
west
without
being
captured
by
the
mob
militia
as
they
approached
the
city
in
the
evening
they
were
discovered
by
general
doniphan
who
received
permission
from
general
lucas
to
try
and
capture
them
but
having
a
superior
knowledge
of
the
ground
they
escaped
seeing
these
large
bodies
of
men
approach
what
militia
there
was
in
far
west
was
drawn
up
in
line
just
south
of
the
city
to
oppose
the
advance
of
the
formidable
enemy
both
parties
sent
out
a
flag
of
truce
and
they
met
between
the
two
forces
in
answer
to
the
inquiry
of
the
citizens
of
far
west
as
to
who
the
mob
forces
were
and
what
their
intentions
the
reply
was
we
want
three
persons
out
of
the
city
before
we
massacre
the
rest
a
hostilities
however
were
postponed
until
the
next
day
and
the
mob
began
the
work
of
encampment
along
the
borders
of
a
small
stream
called
goose
creek
during
the
night
the
people
in
far
west
constructed
as
best
they
could
some
rude
fortifications
south
of

were
reinforced

night

night
that
was
a
terrible
night
of
suspense
for
far

the
people
had
learned
of
the
massacre
at
haun
mill
they
knew
the
murderous
intentions
of
the
mob
forces
encamped
within
two
miles
of
their
homes
and
outnumbering
the
people
of
far
west
by
more
than
four
to
one
and
clothed
with
a
seeming
authority
by
the
highest
officer
in
the
state
to
resist
which
however
outrageous
or
barbarous
the
conduct
of
the
mob
might
be
would
give
further
excuse
for
their
extermination
how
true
the
saying
when
the
wicked
rule
the
people
mourn
it
was
with
heavy
hearts
and
sinking
hopes
that
the
saints
watched
the
first
approach
of
the
gray
dawn
that
ushered
in
the
of
october
about
eight
a
flag
of
truce
was
sent
out
joseph
and
other
church
writers
say
by
the
mob
forces
lucas
in
his
report
to
governor
boggs
says
i
received
a
message
from
colonel
hinkle
the
commander
of
the
forces
caldwell
militia
requesting
an
interview
with
me
on
an
eminence
near
far
west
which
he
would
designate
by
hoisting
a
white
flag
i
sent
him
word
i
would
meet
him
at
two
being
so
much
engaged
in
receiving
and
encamping
fresh
troops
who
were
hourly
coming
in
that
i
could
not
attend
before
it
may
be
judging
from
the
subsequent
treachery
of
colonel
hinkle
that
he
sent
a
secret
messenger
to
lucas
requesting
an
interview
and
that
the
white
flag
sent
out
by
the
mob
forces
of
which
our
church
annals
speak
and
which
was
met
by
hinkle
in
person
with
a
few
others
was
sent
to
give
general
lucas
answer
to
hinkle
earlier
request
for
an
interview
at
any
rate
the
truce
flag
was
sent
out
and
was
met
by
some
of
the
brethren
among
whom
was
hinkle
and
if
anything
special
was
learned
or
accommodations
arranged
or
understanding
arrived
at
by
the
conference
held
with
the
enemy
flag
of
truce
our
writers
have
failed
to
mention
it
the
reasonable
conclusion
is
therefore
that
the
flag
of
truce
merely
brought
to
colonel
hinkle
the
information
that
lucas
could
not
meet
him
until
two
and
that
hinkle
did
meet
him
at
that
time
and
upon
his
own
responsibility
without
consulting
with
the
citizens
of
far
west
or
their
leaders
entered
into
and
bound
the
people
to
the
following
terms
of
capitulation
first
to
give
up
all
their
the
church
leaders
to
be
tried
and
punished
second
to
make
an
appropriation
of
their
property
all
who
have
taken
up
arms
to
the
payment
of
their
debts
and
indemnify
for
damage
done
by
them
third
that
the
balance
should
leave
the
state
and
be
protected
out
by
the
militia
but
to
remain
until
further
orders
were
received
from
the
commander
in
chief
fourth
to
give
up
their
arms
of
every
description
to
be
receipted
for
according
to
lucas
statement
hinkle
while
he
readily
accepted
these
terms
of
capitulation
desired
to
postpone
the
matter
until
the
following
morning
to
which
lucas
replied
that
if
that
was
done
he
would
demand
that
joseph
smith
junior
sidney
rigdon
lyman
wight
parley
pratt
and
george
robinson
be
surrendered
to
his
custody
as
hostages
for
his
faithful
compliance
with
the
foregoing
terms
and
if
after
reflection
and
consultation
the
people
decided
to
reject
the
terms
offered
them
these
hostages
were
to
be
returned
at
the

were

headquarters
near

let
us
pause
here
for
a
moment
reflection
if
lucas
intended
to
deliver
up
those
men
again
what
advantage
was
it
for
him
to
have
them
according
to
his
own
statement
he
offered
hinkle
terms
of
capitulation
which
he
and
the
people
affected
were
to
consider
and
report
their
conclusions
upon
the
following
day
but
lucas
demands
the
principal
mormon
leaders
as
hostages
for
the
faithful
performance
of
what
merely
to
bind
them
to
consider
the
terms
of
capitulation
according
to
lucas
statement
and
if
those
terms
were
rejected
after
due
consideration
and
consultation
these
hostages
were
to
be
restored
to
the
people
was
there
any
need
of
hostages
being
given
to
insure
the
consideration
of
the
terms
of
surrender
offered
not
under
the
circumstances
the
whole
thing
was
a
plan
to
get
the
leaders
of
the
church
into
the
hands
of
the
mob
that
the
governor
order
of
extermination
or
banishment
might
be
carried
out
without
the
mob
militia
running
the
risk
of
some
of
them
losing
their
lives
as
their
generals
believed
the
saints
would
submit
to
any
injustice
or
indignity
rather
than
endanger
the
lives
of
their
prophet
leaders
by
resisting
it
these
men
were
demanded
as
a
pledge
that
the
whole
infamous
agreement
between
lucas
and
hinkle
should
be
faithfully
performed
on
hinkle
part
and
not
to
insure
the
consideration
of
his
terms
of
surrender
as
lucas
clumsily
puts
it
as
i
proceed
with
the
narrative
it
will
be
seen
that
lucas
never
intended
to
restore
the
prisoners
to
their
friends
hinkle
returned
from
the
secret
consultation
with
lucas
and
about
four
in
the
afternoon
told
joseph
smith
and
the
other
men
lucas
demanded
as
hostages
that
the
leaders
of
the
troops
desired
a
consultation
with
them
outside
the
city
limits
accordingly
the
brethren
in
company
with
hinkle
walked
out
of

west
in
the
direction
of
the
enemy
encampment
when
midway
between
that
encampment
and

the
little

hinkle
visited
hyrum
smith
and
told
him
that
a
had
been
held
and
that
he
had
contended
for
his
hyrum
acquittal
but
it
availed
nothing
and
all
were
to
be
shot
the
next
morning
general
wilson
had
made
an
effort
during
the
day
to
corrupt
lyman
wight
and
get
him
to
testify
to
something
against
joseph
smith
but
in
this
he
failed
about
the
time
hinkle
went
to
hyrum
general
wilson
took
wight
aside
and
told
him
the
decision
of
the
shoot

this
time
general
doniphan
came
up
to

wight
and
addressing
the
latter
he
said
colonel
the
decision
is
a
damned
hard
one
but
i
wash
my
hands
against
such
murder
and
he
further
said
that
he
intended
to
remove
his
troops
the
following
day
as
soon
as
light
that
they
should
not
witness
such
heartless
murder
general
graham
and
a
few
others
whose
names
unfortunately
have
not
been
preserved
had
voted
against
the
decision
of
the
but
it
availed
nothing
the
bold
stand
taken
by
general
doniphan
the
next
morning
in
threatening
to
remove
his
troops
and
denouncing
the
execution
of
the
prisoners

murder

lucas
and
he
changed
his
mind
about
executing
the
decision
of
the
courtmartial
in
fact
he
revoked
the
decree
and
placed
the
prisoners

permitted
to
get
a
change
of
linen
and
take
leave
of
their
families
though
in
the
presence
of
a
brutal
guard
this
parting
which
they
had
good
reason
to
believe
was
their
final
one
was
very
distressing
yet
it
was
borne
with
manly
fortitude
parley

was
sick
with
a
fever
with
an
infant
at
her
breast
the
roof
of
the
miserable
hovel
in
which
she
lay
afforded
but
little
protection
from
the
drizzling
rain
which
at
the
time
was
falling
his
large
comfortable
house
had
been
pulled
down
by
the
mob
and
he
had
been
forced
to
find
temporary
shelter
in

for
his
sick

and
her
young
family
stretched
out
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
on
which
his

another
woman
who
had
been
driven
from

home
the
night

who
now
was
in
the
throes
of
to
leave
a
family
sick
and
helpless
and
destitute

exposed
to
the
insults
of

lawless

went
to
general

and
told
him
the
circumstances
of
his
family
with
the
view
of
getting
time
to
provide
for
their
comfort
but
he
was
only
answered
with
a
mocking
exultant
laugh
the
wife
of
hyrum
smith
was
near
her
confinement
yet
he
was
compelled
to
take
his
leave
of
her
in
the
presence
of
his
brutal
guard
who
peremptorily
ordered
her
to
get
her
husband
a
change
of
clothing
within
two
minutes
or
he
would
be
compelled
to
go
without
them
and
after
securing
the
clothing
he
was
rudely
hustled
out
of
the
house
to
join
the
rest
of
the
prisoners
the
separation
of
sidney
rigdon
from
his
family
was
scarcely
less
distressing
and
joseph
had
been
as
roughly
torn
away
from
his
family
the
prisoners
were
placed
in
a
wagon
around
which
crowded
the
friends
and
relatives
among
whom
were
the
aged
parents
of
joseph
and
hyrum
their
hearts
wrung
with
anguish
and
their
eyes
blinded
with
tears
as
they
beheld
their
noble
sons
in
the
hands
of
their
merciless
enemies
no
one
was
allowed
to
speak
to
them
the
silent
pressure
of
the
hand
was
the
only
token
of
affection
granted
and
the
wagon
containing
the
prisoners
moved
on
surrounded
by
its
military
guard
and
followed
by
the
prayers
of
wives
and
a
people
leaving
the
prisoners
to
pursue
their
journey
to
independence
let
us
relate
what
happened
about
far
west
and
diahman
joseph
and
his
were
started
for
jackson
county
on
the
second
of
november
and
general
clark
arrived
at
far
west
on
the
fourth
in
the
meantime
lucas
had
sent
niel
gilliam
company
and
a
part
of
general
parks
brigade
under
command
of
general
parks
with
orders
to
surround
diahman
and
disarm
the
people
and
just
before
clark
arrived
lucas
too
went
to
diahman
the
first
thing
done
by
clark
was
to
send
orders
to
general
lucas
to
take
all
the
men
among
the
mormons
prisoners
and
secure
their
property
with
a
view
of
paying
with
it
the
damages
that
had
been
sustained
by
the
old
settlers
after
this
the
brethren
remaining
at
far
west
were
drawn
up
in
line
and
the
names
of
called
off
and
as
they
stepped
out
from
the
line
they
were
put
under
arrest
to
await
a
trial
though
they
were
not
informed
as
to
the
nature
of
the
charges
against
them
after
these
had
been
secured
general
clark
addressed
himself
to
the
remainder
and
referred
them
to
the
terms
of
surrender
that
colonel
hinkle
had
arranged
for
them
without
their
consent
and
even
without
consulting
with
them
yet
general
clark
as
rigidly
enforced
those
terms
as
if
the
people
had
drafted
them
or
had
given
them
their
sanction
after
they
were
drafted
the
first
item
in
the
terms
of
capitulation
was
that
the
leaders
of
the
people
should
be
given
up
to
be
dealt
with
according
to
law
this
said
clark
you
have
complied
with
the
second
item
was
that
they
should
deliver
up
their
arms
this
has
been
attended
to
said
the
general
the
third
stipulation
was
that
they
sign
over
their
property
to
defray
the
expenses
of
the
war
this
you
have
also
done
complacently
went
on
clark
that
was
true
the
saints
had
signed
away
their
property
at
the
point
of
the
musket
while
the
mob
which
compelled
them
to
go
to
such
extremes
mocked
them
with
their
taunts
and
sneers
unchecked
by
the
officers
who
commanded
them
after
enumerating
the
things
the
saints
had
complied
with
the
general
concluded
his
speech
in
these
words
another
article
yet
remains
for
you
to
comply
with
and
that
is
that
you
leave
the
state
forthwith
and
whatever
may
be
your
feelings
concerning
this
or
whatever
your
innocence
it
is
nothing
to
me
general
lucas
who
is
equal
in
authority
with
me
has
made
this
treaty
with
you
i
approve
of
it
i
should
have
done
the
same
had
i
been
here
i
am
therefore
determined
to
see
it
fulfilled
the
character
of
this
state
has
suffered
almost
beyond
redemption
from
the
character
conduct
and
influence
that
you
have
exerted
and
we
deem
it
an
act
of
justice
to
restore
her
character
to
its
former
standing
among
the
states
by
every
proper
means
the
orders
of
the
governor
to
me
were
that
you
should
be
exterminated
and
not
allowed
to
remain
in
the
state
and
had
your
leaders
not
been
given
up
and
the
terms
of
the
treaty
complied
with
before
this
you
and
your
families
would
have
been
destroyed
and
your
homes
in
ashes
there
is
a
discretionary
power
vested
in
my
hands
which
i
shall
exercise
in
your
favor
for
a
season
for
this
lenity
you
are
indebted
to
i
do
not
say
that
you
shall
go
now
but
you
must
not
think
of
staying
here
another
season
or
of
putting
in
crops
for
the
moment
you
do
this
the
citizens
will
be
upon
you
if
i
am
called
here
again
in
case
of
a
of
a
treaty
made
do
not
think
that
i
shall
act
any
more
as
i
have
done
you
need
not
expect
any
mercy
but
extermination
for
i
am
determined
the
governor
order
shall
be
executed
as
for
your
leaders
do
not
once
think
do
not
imagine
for
a
moment
do
not
let
it
enter
your
mind
that
they
will
be
delivered
or
that
you
will
see
their
faces
again
for
fate
is
fixed
their
die
is
cast
their
doom
is
i
am
sorry
gentlemen
to
see
so
great
a
number
of
apparently
intelligent
men
found
in
the
situation
you
are
and
oh
that
i
could
invoke
that
spirit
the
unknown
god
to
rest
upon
you
and
make
you
sufficiently
intelligent
to
break
that
chain
of
superstition
and
liberate
you
from
those
fetters
of
fanaticism
with
which
you
are
bound
that
you
no
longer
worship
a
man
i
would
advise
you
to
scatter
abroad
and
never
again
organize
yourselves
with
bishops
presidents
lest
you
excite
the
jealousies
of
the
people
and
subject
yourselves
to
the
same
calamities
that
have
now
come
upon
you
you
have
always
been
the
aggressors
you
have
brought
upon
yourselves
these
difficulties
by
being
disaffected
and
not
being
subject
to
rule
and
my
advice
is
that
you
become
as
other
citizens
lest
by
a
recurrence
of
these
events
you
bring
upon
yourselves
irretrievable
ruin
after
listening
to
this
harangue
this
mixture
of
hypocrisy
and
conceit
affected
pity
and
heartless
cruelty
pretended
patriotism
and
willful
treason
the
brethren
who
had
been
arrested
for
what
they
knew
not
neither
did
clark
appear
able
to
inform
them
were
sent
to
richmond
where
they
were
to
be
tried
and
the
remainder
were
dismissed
to
provide
food
and
fuel
for
their
families
and
make
preparations
for
leaving
the
state
governor
boggs
appeared
anxious
about
having
his
exterminating
orders
carried
into
effect
and
occasionally
stirred
up
general
clark
to
a
lively
remembrance
of
what
he
expected
him
to
do
by
sending
him
messages
from
time
to
time
here
is
a
specimen
received
directly
after
clark
had
sent
the
prisoners
to
richmond
it
will
be
a
necessity
that
you
hold
a
military
court
of
inquiry
in
daviess
county
and
arrest
the
mormons
who
have
been
guilty
of
the
late
outrages
committed
towards
the
inhabitants
of
said
county
my
instructions
to
you
are
to
settle
this
whole
matter
completely
if
possible
before
you
disband
your
forces
if
the
mormons
are
disposed
voluntarily
to
leave
the
state
of
course
it
would
be
advisable
in
you
to
promote
that
object
in
any
way
deemed
proper
ought
by
no
means
to
be
permitted
to
escape
the
punishment
they
as
if
inspired
to
new
zeal
by
the
receipt
of
this
message
clark
ordered
general
wilson
who
in
the
meantime
had
returned
from
jackson
county
to
go
to
diahman
and
take
charge
of
all
the
prisoners
at
that
place
and
ascertain
those
who
had
committed
crimes
put
them
under
close
guard
and
when
he
moved
to
take
them
to
keytesville
the
county
seat
of
chariton
county
and
between
seventy
and
eighty
miles
from
diahman
a
number
of
the
brethren
were
taken
prisoners
at
diahman
and
were
examined
before
judge
adam
black
one
of
the
ringleaders
of
the
mob
in
bringing
about
the
whole
trouble
but
even
he
was
obliged
to
acquit
the
brethren
brought
before
him
as
they
were
innocent
of
the
charges
made
against
them
at
the
close
of
their
examination
general
wilson
ordered
all
the
saints
to
leave
diahman
within
ten
days
with
permission
to
move
into
caldwell
county
and
remain
until
spring
when
they
were
to
leave
the
state
a
committee
of
twelve
men
were
granted
the
privilege
of
moving
about
freely
between
far
west
and
diahman
with
permission
to
move
the
corn
and
household
goods
from
the
latter
to
the
former
place
the
stock
or
the
most
of
it
was
taken
possession
of
by
the
the
committee
of
twelve
were
to
wear
white
badges
on
their
hats
in
order
that
they
might
be
easily
recognized
by
the
forces
that
would
be
detailed
to
watch
the
movements
of
the
mormon
people
by
this
arrangement
the
saints
at
diahman
were
driven
from
their
comfortable
homes
to
camp
out
through
a
long
dreary
and
severe
winter
in
their
wagons
and
tents
by
reason
of
which
exposure
many
perished
among
whom
were
a
number
of
delicate
women
and
children

it
is
time
now
that
we
turn
our
attention
to
what
befell
joseph
smith
and
his
the
first
day
from
far
west
they
made
twelve
miles
camping
at
night
on
crooked
river
a
strong
guard
was
placed
around
the
prisoners
who
watched
them
closely
the
next
morning
the
prophet
joseph
had
a
word
of
comfort
for
his
brethren
he
spoke
to
each
one
quietly
saying
be
of
good
cheer
brethren
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
me
last
night
that
our
lives
should
be
given
us
and
that
whatever
we
might
suffer
during
this
captivity
not
one
of
our
lives
should
be
taken
a

a
autobiography
of
parley
pratt
page
the
reader
will
pardon
me
if
i
anticipate
sufficiently
to
say
that
this
remarkable
prophecy
was
verily
fulfilled
not
one
of
their
lives
was
sacrificed
the
same
day
this
prophecy
was
made
the
prisoners
reached
the
missouri
river
and
were
hurried
across
into
jackson
county
for
general
clark
had
sent
word
to
lucas
to
bring
the
prisoners
to
him
at
richmond
but
wilson
was
determined
to
exhibit
the
prisoners
at
independence
on
the
journey
wilson
became
more
friendly
towards
his
prisoners
and
conversed
freely
with
them
in
relation
to
the
disturbances
which
had
taken
place
in
jackson
county
in
general
wilson
it
must
be
remembered
was
the
man
who
kept
a
store
about
one
mile
west
of
big
blue
and
seven
or
eight
miles
west
of
independence
and
who
was
active
in
driving
the
saints
from
jackson
county
and
burning
their
homes
of
the
part
he
took
in
these
proceedings
he
boasted
as
if
it
was
some
laudable
work
he
had
accomplished
though
he
admitted
that
he
and
his
associates
then
and
now
were
the
aggressors
and
that
the
manner
of
life
followed
by
the
saints
was
blameless
on
the
fourth
the
prisoners
and
their
guards
arrived
at
independence
and
though
it
was
raining
the
prisoners
were
driven
about
the
streets
for
the
purpose
of
exhibiting
them
to
the
crowds
which
had
come
together
to
see
them
they
were
placed
in
an
old
vacant
house
where
many
came
to
see
them
during
that
and
the
following
day
among
those
who
came
on
the
first
day
was
a
lady
who
innocently
inquired
which
one
of
the
men
it
was
the
mormons
worshiped
joseph
was
pointed
out
to
her
as
the
one
and
she
inquired
of
him
if
he
professed
to
be
the
lord
and
savior
to
which
he
replied
that
he
professed
to
be
nothing
but
a
man
and
a
minister
of
salvation
sent
by
jesus
christ
to
preach
the
gospel
this
astonished
the
lady
and
her
eager
questions
brought
from
the
prophet
ever
willing
to
preach
the
gospel
either
in
freedom
or
in
bondage
a
discourse
on
the
principles
he
was
sent
to
teach
the
lady
broke
down
in
tears
and
left
their
dingy
prison
with
a
prayer
for
their
safety
and
deliverance
joseph
native
eloquence
and
the
truth
he
advocated
had
gained
another
triumph
for
not
only
was
the
lady
overcome
with
what
she
heard
but
it
had
its
effect
upon
all
who
listened
in
a
day
or
two
the
prisoners
were
removed
from
their
miserable
quarters
where
the
floor
had
been
their
bed
and
blocks
of
wood
their
pillows
to
the
best
hotel
in
the
city
where
they
were
treated
kindly
and
allowed
to
move
about
pretty
freely
with
a
small
guard
to
watch
their
movements
subsequently
however
they
had
to
pay
their
own
expense
at
this
hotel
and
exorbitant
charges
were
made
for
every
comfort
afforded
them
during
the
few
days
that
joseph
and
his
remained
at
independence
several
messages
were
sent
from
general
headquarters
at
richmond
to
have
the
mormon
leaders
sent
there
immediately
general
wilson
however
found
it
difficult
to
secure
a
guard
to
accompany
them
as
no
one
would
volunteer
and
when
men
were
drafted
they
refused
to
obey
orders
at
last
three
men
were
obtained
as
a
guard
and
on
the
morning
of
the
eighth
of
november
they
set
out
for
richmond
they
traveled
down
the
south
bank
of
the
missouri
river
to
a
ferry
kept
by
a
frenchman
by
the
name
of
roy
here
they
crossed
the
river
and
after
going
about
a
half
a
mile
lodged
for
the
night
at
a
private
house
the
guard
who
accompanied
the
prisoners
came
more
as
a
protection
to
them
than
to
hinder
them
from
escaping
and
the
people
in
and
about
independence
appeared
willing
for
the
prisoners
to
escape
the
guards
had
been
drinking
during
the
day
and
not
infrequently
the
prisoners
were
sixty
or
eighty
rods
in
the
rear
or
ahead
of
them
when
night
found
them
at
the
private
house
before
mentioned
sleep
so
overpowered
the
guards
that
they
gave
their
arms
into
the
hands
of
the
prisoners
that
they
might
protect
themselves
if
occasion
to
do
so
should
occur
and
that
was
quite
likely
since
they
were
in
a
neighborhood
filled
with
their
most
bitter
enemies
the
night
passed
however
without
any
disturbance
and
the
next
morning
the
journey
to
richmond
was
continued
before
starting
a
number
of
armed
and
men
gathered
about
the
prisoners
with
curses
and
threats
and
the
guards
alarmed
for
their
safety
sent
a
messenger
to
richmond
to
obtain
a
stronger
guard
without
waiting
for
its
arrival
the
little
company
proceeded
on
its
journey
but
had
not
gone
far
when
they
met
colonel
sterling
price
and
a
guard
of
seventy
soldiers
arriving
at
richmond
joseph
and
his
brethren
were
thrust
into
an
old
vacant
house
under
guard
soon
afterwards
they
were
visited
by
general
clark
who
was
introduced
to
them
the
prisoners
made
an
effort
to
find
out
the
charges
against
them
but
clark
evaded
their
questions
and
shortly
withdrew
clark
had
left
the
room
but
a
few
minutes
when
colonel
price
came
in
accompanied
by
a
blacksmith
of
the
name
of
john
fulkerson
carrying
a
log
chain
and
a
number
of
the
windows
to
the
house
were
nailed
down
and
the
seven
prisoners
from
independence
were
chained
together
by
the
ankles

guard
of
ten
men
standing
with
guns
poised
and
their
thumbs
on
the
hammers
for
instant
use
in
the
meantime
general
clark
was
searching
for
authority
to
try
the
prisoners
before
a
and
it
would
appear
from
the
testimony
of
a
brother
by
the
name
of
grant
that
he
had
concluded
to
so
proceed
and
had
even
given
the
sentence
of
the
court
before
an
investigation
had
occurred
for
this
young

made

headquarters

saw
that
general
select
the
men
who
were
to
shoot
the
mormon
leaders
on
the
morning
of
the
twelfth
of
november
he
saw
these
men
choose
their
rifles
and
load
them
with
two
balls
in
each
after
which
clark
said
to
them

some
of
the
friends
of
the

brethren
intimated
to
the
general
that
he
had
no
authority
to
try
the
prisoners
by
whereupon
he
sent
to
fort
leavenworth
to
obtain
the
military
code
of
laws
which
he
searched
for
several
days
for
authority
to
try
the
prisoners
as
he
had
proposed
by
at
last
he
had
to
give
it
up
but
he
did
it
with
great
reluctance
he
visited
the
prison
where
joseph
and
his
brethren
were
confined
and
told
them
he
had
decided
to
deliver
them
to
the
civil
authorities
and
informed
them
they
were
accused
of
treason
murder
arson
larceny
theft
and
stealing
the
prisoners
then
were
delivered
into
the
hands

from
the
eleventh
of
november
to
the
each
night
after
the
examination
the
prisoners
who
had
been
brought
down
from
independence
were
taken
to
their
gloomy
prison
and
chained
together
while
about
fifty
of
their
brethren
and
who
had
been
brought
from
far
west
were
kept
under
guard
in
an
open
unfinished
exposed
to
the
excessive
coldness
of
that
inclement
season
the
constitution
of
elder
rigdon
was
so
delicate
that
in
consequence
of
the
exposure
and
hardships
he
was
forced
to
endure
under
this
cruel
persecution
his
health
broke
down
and
at
last
he
lost
his
reason
yet
he
was
chained
to
his
companions
and
compelled
to
remain
in
the
presence
of
a
noisy
and
unruly
and
unfeeling
guard
his
daughter
who
was
the
wife
of
george
robinson
one
of
the
prisoners
fastened
to
the

chain
with
her
father

this
delicate

through

gloomy
days
and
through
her
tenderness
and
anxious
care
nursed
him
back
to
health
and
reason
the
guard
under
colonel
price
was
perhaps
the
most
foulmouthed
and
villainous
that
could
possibly
be
brought
together
they
related
to
each
other
their
deeds
of
murder
and
rapine
and
boasted
of
raping
virtuous
wives
and
maidens
until
the
prisoners
were
with
the
disgusting
details
of
their
crimes
parley
pratt
relates
an
incident
that
occurred
in
the
prison
one
night
when
the
guards
were
unusually
obscene
which
we
give
entire
in
that
writer
own
language
i
had
listened
to
the
guard
boasts
of
defiling
wives
and
maidens
by
force
till
i
became
so
disgusted
shocked
horrified
and
so
filled
with
the
spirit
of
indignant
justice
that
i
could
scarcely
refrain
from
rising
upon
my
feet
and
rebuking
the
guards
but
had
said
nothing
to
joseph
or
any
one
else
although
i
lay
next
to
him
and
knew
he
was
awake
on
a
sudden
he
arose
to
his
feet
and
spoke
in
a
voice
of
thunder
or
as
the
roaring
lion
uttering
as
near
as
i
can
recollect
the
following
ye
fiends
of
the
the
infernal
pit
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
i
rebuke
you
and
command
you
to
be
still
i
will
not
live
another
minute
and
hear
such
language
cease
such
talk
or
you
or
i
die
he
ceased
to
speak
he
stood
erect
in
terrible
majesty
chained
and
without
a
weapon
calm
unruffled
dignified
as
an
angel
he
looked
upon
the
quailing
guards
whose
weapons
were
lowered
or
dropped
to
the
ground
whose
knees
smote
together
and
who
shrinking
into
a
corner
or
crouching
at
his
feet
begged
his
pardon
and
remained
quiet
till
a
change
of
guards
i
have
seen
the
ministers
of
justice
clothed
in
magisterial
robes
and
criminals
arraigned
before
them
while
life
was
suspended
on
a
breath
in
the
courts
of
england
i
have
witnessed
a
congress
in
solemn
session
to
give
laws
to
nations
i
have
tried
to
conceive
of
kings
or
royal
courts
of
thrones
and
crowns
and
of
emperors
assembled
to
decide
the
fate
of
kingdoms
but
dignity
and
majesty
have
i
seen
but
once
as
it
stood
in
chains
at
midnight
in
a
dungeon
in
an
obscure
village
in
missouri
chapter
xliv
a
strong
point
for
treason
fifteen
days
were
consumed
in
taking
testimony
for
the
state
at
the
expiration
of
that
time
the
judge
ordered
the
defendants
to
bring
forth
their
rebutting
testimony
or
he
would
thrust
them
into
prison
i
could
hardly
understand
what
the
judge
meant
says
hyrum
smith
as
i
considered
we
were
in
prison
already
the
names
of
forty
persons
residents
of
far
west
were
given
to
the
court
to
be
called
as
witnesses
for
the
defense
and
the
subpoenas
for
them
were
placed
in
the
hands
of
captain
or
parson
which
ever
title
the
reader
may
be
best
pleased
to
know
him
by
for
he
was
both
captain
of
a
gang
of
mobbers
and
a
supposed
minister
of
christ
and
now
an
arm
of
the
civil
power
any
way
it
was
bogard
of
crooked
river
battle
fame
he
took
with
him
a
force
of
fifty
men
and
started
for
far
west
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
returned
with
the
forty
men
they
were
at
once
put
under
arrest
and
by
this
cunning
were
prevented
from
appearing
as
witnesses
after
executing
this
de
the
judge
petulantly
exclaimed
gentlemen
you
must
get
your
witnesses
or
you
shall
be
committed
to
jail
immediately
most
of
the
brethren
felt
very
much
discouraged
at
the
turn
affairs
had
taken
but
hyrum
smith
under
the
advice
of
general
doniphan
and
lawyer
reese
gave
the
names
of
some
twenty
other
persons
at
far
west
who
were
desirable
as
witnesses
the
same
man
was
ordered
to
bring
the
witnesses
to
richmond
but
in
the
meantime
the
people
at
far
west
had
learned
of
the
intrigue
being
practiced
upon
them
and
the
persons
whose
names
bogard
took
with
him
who
had
not
left
the
state
kept
out
of
the
way
and
he
returned
to
richmond
with
but
one
man
who
was
wanted
and
he
was
thrust
into
jail
and
not
allowed
to
testify
the
judge
again
urged
the
prisoners
to
bring
on
their
witnesses
telling
them
it
was
the
last
day
he
would
hold
the
court
open
for
them
while
the
brethren
were
in
consultation
with
their
lawyers
a
allen
passed
the
window
and
hyrum
smith
beckoned
to
him
to
come
inside
and
the
prisoners
then
informed
the
court
that
they
had
one
witness
who
was
ready
to
be
sworn
but
at
this
juncture
the
prosecuting
attorney
birch
objected
to
having
the
witness
testify
as
this
court
was
merely
investigating
the
case
and
not
trying
it
notwithstanding
the
frequent
calls
from
the
court
asking
the
accused
to
procure
witnesses
general
doniphan
here
lost
his
patience
and
rising
to
his
feet
he
said
be
g
d
if
the
witness
is
not
sworn
it
is
a
d
shame
to
treat
these
defendants
in
this
manner
they
are
not
allowed
to
put
one
witness
on
the
stand
while
the
witnesses
they
have
sent
for
have
been
captured
by
force
of
arms
and
thrust
into
the
pen
to
prevent
their
testifying
no
sooner
however
had
allen
begun
his
testimony
than
he
was
taken
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
by
a
of
the
priest
bogard
kicked
out
of
the
room
and
made
to
run
for
his
life
during
this
preliminary
examination
judge
king
appeared
extremely
anxious
to
fasten
the
crime
of
treason
upon
joseph
smith
and
his
associates
and
to
that
end
he
bent
every
energy
knowing
that
if
a
charge
of
that
character
were
sustained
against
them
he
could
refuse
them
bail
the
judge
asked
one
of
the
witnesses
if
the
mormons
sent
missionaries
to
foreign
countries
he
was
answered
in
the
affirmative
do
the
profess
a
belief
in
the
seventh
chapter
of
daniel
and
the
verse
a
asked
the
judge
foonote
a
and
the
kingdom
and
dominion
and
the
greatness
of
the
kingdom
under
the
whole
heavens
shall
be
given
to
the
people
of
the
saints
of
the
most
high
whose
kingdom
is
an
everlasting
kingdom
and
all
dominions
shall
serve
and
obey
him
meaning
christ
daniel
certainly
they
do
replied
the
witness
then
said
judge
king
turning
to
the
clerk
of
the
court
and
speaking
with
that
dignity
all
judges
are
supposed
to
possess
put
that
down
that
is
a
strong
point
for
treason
the
examination
resulted
in
the
prophet
joseph
his
brother
hyrum
sidney
rigdon
lyman
wight
caleb
baldwin
and
alexander
mcrae
being
committed
on
a
charge
of
treason
and
sent
to
liberty
jail
in
clay
county
parley
pratt
morris
phelps
lyman
gibbs
darwin
chase
and
norman
shearer
were
committed
on
a
charge
of
murder
for
the
part
they
took
in
the
battle
of
crooked
river
and
were
to
remain
in
prison
at
richmond
the
other
brethren
that
had
been
sent
to
richmond
as
prisoners
by
general
clark
and
the
forty
brought
down
by
bogard
under
the
pretense
that
they
were
to
be
witnesses
on
behalf
of
their
brethren
were
either
released
or
admitted
to
bail
those
admitted
to
bail
together
with
those
who
went
on
their
bonds
were
subsequently
driven
from
the
state
so
that
the
bail
was
forfeited
having
followed
the
brethren
in
bonds
thus
far
we
must
turn
our
attention
to
what
befell
the
main
body
of
the
saints
chapter
xlv
exodus
from
missouri
it
will
perhaps
be
remembered
that
the
saints
at
diahman
were
given
a
very
limited
time
by
general
wilson
in
which
to
leave
for
far
west
only
ten
days
therefore
in
their
flight
to
far
west
they
left
much
of
their
stock
and
property
behind
them
on
the
first
of
december
the
mormon
committee
that
had
been
granted
the
privilege
of
moving
freely
between
diahman
and
far
west
for
a
limited
time
proposed
to
a
committee
of
daviess
county
citizens
peniston
kerr
and
adam
black
that
the
mormon
committee
be
allowed
first
to
employ
twenty
teams
and
their
drivers
to
move
the
property
of
the
saints
from
diahman
to
far
west
and
second
that
they
be
allowed
to
collect
all
stock
the
mormon
people
owned
in
daviess
county
and
that
on
a
given
day
a
committee
from
said
county
examine
the
stock
and
accompany
the
mormon
committee
and
the
stock
out
of
the
county
the
brethren
binding
themselves
on
their
part
not
to
take
any
stock
from
the
county
after
this
general
drive
these
propositions
were
accepted
by
the
daviess
county
committee
and
duly
executed
though
much
of
the
stock
belonging
to
the
saints
had
been
driven
away
or
shot
down
to
supply
the
mob
forces
with
beef
it
was
during
these
trying
times
that
brigham
young
afterwards
the
president
of
the
church
began
to
exhibit
those
executive
qualities
which
so
eminently
fitted
him
as
a
great
leader
by
the
apostasy
of
thomas
marsh
the
presidency
of
the
quorum
of
the
twelve
apostles
devolved
upon
him
hence
also
the
leadership
of
the
church
during
the
absence
of
the
first
presidency
was
god
training
him
for
leadership
in
that
greater
exodus
to
take
place
a
few
years
later
he
called
together
those
members
of
the
high
council
of
the
far
west
stake
of
zion
that
still
remained
in
far
west
and
enquired
of
them
as
to
their
faith
in
the
work
first
telling
them
that
his
own
faith
was
unshaken
all
the
members
present
expressed
their
undying
faith
in
the
gospel
and
their
confidence
in
joseph
smith
as
a
prophet
of
god
the
council
was
then
reorganized
the
vacancies
caused
by
absence
or
apostasy
were
filled
up
and
the
council
was
prepared
to
do
business
elders
john
taylor
and
john
page
both
of
whom
had
previously
been
chosen
by
revelation
for
the
office
were
ordained
members
of
the
quorum
of
the
twelve
apostles
on
the
nineteenth
day
of
september
under
the
hands
of
brigham
young
and
heber
kimball
this
work
of
setting
in
order
the
high
council
and
filling
the
vacancies
in
the
quorum
of
the
apostles
being
accomplished
elder
young
waited
upon
bishop
partridge
and
proposed
to
him
that
they
adopt
some
plan
to
remove
the
poor
from
the
state
that
they
might
not
fall
victims
to
the
governor
exterminating
order
the
bishop
reply
was
rather
ungracious
for
he
said
the
poor
may
take
care
of
themselves
and
i
will
take
care
of
myself
well
said
elder
young
if
you
will
not
help
them
out
i
will
here
however
i
would
suggest
to
the
reader
not
to
judge
the
bishop
too
harshly
for
the
petulant
expression
he
allowed
to
escape
him
at
that
moment
let
it
be
remembered
that
when
the
bishop
first
became
connected
with
the
church
he
was
a
man
of
considerable
means
and
now
in
consequence
of
frequent
drivings
and
caring
for
his
brethren
he
found
himself
stripped
of
nearly
all
his
earthly
possessions
and
sorely
perplexed
as
to
the
future
no
wonder
then
if
in
a
moment
of
forgetfulness
he
made
the
remark
quoted
above
those
were
days
that
tried
men
souls
be
not
surprised
if
good
men
and
true
had
their
periods
of
despondency
elder
young
activity
and
zeal
in
the
matter
of
caring
for
the
poor
were
unbounded
a
public
meeting
was
called
not
only
of
the
saints
but
also
of
the
citizens
of
caldwell
county
and
the
poverty
and
distress
of
many
of
the
saints
presented
to
them
several
gentlemen
not
members
of
the
church
expressed
themselves
as
being
of
opinion
that
an
appeal
should
be
made
to
the
citizens
of
upper
missouri
inviting
their
assistance
towards
furnishing
means
to
remove
the
poor
from
caldwell
county
whether
such
an
appeal
was
made
or
not
i
can
not
say
but
rather
think
not
as
a
resolution
was
adopted
at
this
meeting
as
follows
that
it
is
the
opinion
of
this
meeting
that
an
exertion
should
be
made
to
ascertain
how
much
means
can
be
obtained
from
individuals
of
the
society
church
and
that
it
is
the
duty
of
those
who
have
to
assist
those
who
have
not
that
thereby
we
may
as
far
as
possible
within
and
of
ourselves
comply
with
the
demands
of
the
executive
so
that
the
generosity
of
the
people
of
upper
missouri
i
think
was
not
appealed
to
by
the
saints
that
were
driven
from
among
them
at
a
subsequent
meeting
similar
in
character
to
the
one
alluded
to
elder
young
offered
this
resolution
that
we
this
day
enter
into
a
covenant
to
stand
by
and
assist
each
other
to
the
utmost
of
our
abilities
in
removing
from
this
state
and
that
we
will
never
desert
the
poor
who
are
worthy
till
they
shall
be
out
of
the
reach
of
the
general
exterminating
order
of
general
clark
acting
for
and
in
the
name
of
the
state
this
resolution
was
adopted
and
a
committee
of
seven
appointed
to
superintend
the
removal
of
the
saints
a
committee
was
also
appointed
to
draft
a
covenant
that
should
bind
the
saints
in
an
agreement
to
assist
each
other
to
the
extent
of
their
available
property
to
remove
from
the
state
of
missouri
in
accordance
with
the
orders
of
the
governor
this
covenant
was
drawn
up
in
due
form
and
signed
by
the
faithful
brethren
elder
young
secured
eighty
names
to
this
covenant
the
first
day
he
took
hold
of
it
and
three
hundred
the
next
the
prophet
joseph
not
willing
to
be
behind
the
other
brethren
in
the
good
work
hearing
what
was
going
on
through
those
who
visited
him
while
in
prison
from
his
gloomy
dungeon
at
liberty
sent
the
brethren
a
hundred
dollars
to
assist
in
removing
the
saints
charles
bird
was
appointed
to
go
down
towards
the
mississippi
and
make
deposits
of
corn
for
the
use
of
the
saints
as
they
should
make
their
way
out
of
the
state
he
was
also
to
make
contracts
for
ferriage
and
arrange
whatever
else
might
be
necessary
for
their
comfort
and
security
thus
all
things
were
prepared
for
the
exodus
of
the
church
from
the
unfriendly
state
of
missouri
no
sooner
had
these
arrangements
been
perfected
than
elder
young
whose
wisdom
and
activity
had
doubtless
given
offense
to
the
enemies
of
the
church
had
to
flee
from
far
west
to
escape
the
vengeance
of
the
mob
he
went
to
illinois
in
his
labors
elder
young
had
been
materially
assisted
by
the
support
and
counsels
of
heber
kimball
john
taylor
and
the
members
of
the
various
committees
that
had
been
appointed
to
whom
was
now
left
the
execution
of
the
plans
that
had
been
laid
for
the
removal
of
the
church
i
can
not
dwell
upon
all
the
details
of
that
exodus
all
i
need
say
here
is
that
it
was
managed
with
consummate
wisdom
and
in
view
of
all
the
difficulties
in
the
way
with
less
suffering
than
could
have
been
expected
by
the
twentieth
of
april
nearly
all
the
saints
variously
estimated
from
twelve
to
fifteen
thousand
had
left
the
state
where
they
had
experienced
so
much
sorrow
and
found
a
temporary
resting
place
in
the
state
of
illinois
chiefly
in
the
city
of
quincy
and
vicinity
but
a
few
settled
in
the
then
territory
of
iowa
chapter
xlvi
again
the
passively
good
petitions
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
all
the
people
of
missouri
sanctioned
the
outrages
committed
against
the
church
on
the
contrary
there
was
here
and
there
an
honorable
man
who
protested
against
the
conduct
of
the
mob
and
the
authorities
and
occasionally
some
newspaper
would
deplore
the
action
of
the
state
against
the
saints
among
the
men
who
were
moved
with
sympathy
by
their
sufferings
was
michael
arthur
he
wrote
to
the
representatives
in
the
state
legislature
from
clay
county
relating
the
vile
atrocities
that
were
heaped
upon
the
heads
of
the
defenseless
saints
after
they
had
surrendered
their
arms
to
general
clark
he
represented
that
the
mormons
were
willing
to
leave
the
state
in
fact
that
they
were
making
every
effort
that
their
limited
means
would
permit
them
to
make
to
get
away
and
suggested
that
a
company
of
reliable
men
under
the
command
of
geo
pryer
be
authorized
to
patrol
on
the
line
between
daviess
and
caldwell
counties
with
authority
to
arrest
any
one
they
found
disturbing
the
peace
that
the
mormons
might
be
protected
while
they
were
making
preparations
to
leave
the
state
and
if
it
was
impracticable
to
organize
this
company
of
men
then
he
suggested
that
the
arms
taken
from
the
mormons
be
returned
to
them
that
they
might
defend
themselves
from
the
barbarous
attacks
of
their
enemies
nor
were
the
saints
wanting
in
attention
to
the
instructions
of
the
lord
in
the
matter
of
petitioning
for
a
redress
of
their
grievances
for
as
soon
as
the
legislature
was
convened
they
sent
a
statement
of
all
the
wrongs
heaped
upon
them
during
their
sojourn
in
the
state
of
missouri
from
the
time
they
first
settled
in
jackson
county
to
the
treaty
forced
upon
them
at
far
west
by
generals
lucas
and
clark
and
the
outrages
that
had
been
committed
against
them
since
the
surrender
of
their
arms
after
detailing
the
story
of
their
wrongs
they
asked
first
that
the
legislature
pass
a
law
rescinding
the
exterminating
order
of
governor
boggs
second
they
asked
an
expression
of
the
legislature
disapproving
the
conduct
of
those
who
compelled
them
to
sign
a
deed
of
trust
at
the
muzzle
of
the
musket
and
of
any
man
in
consequence
of
that
deed
of
trust
taking
their
property
and
appropriating
it
to
the
payment
of
damages
sustained
in
consequence
of
trespasses
committed
by
others
third
that
they
receive
payment
for
the
six
hundred
and
arms
that
were
taken
from
them
which
were
worth
twelve
or
fifteen
thousand
dollars
fourth
that
an
appropriation
be
made
to
reimburse
them
for
their
loss
of
lands
from
which
they
had
been
driven
in
jackson
county
the
petition
closed
in
these
words
in
laying
our
case
before
your
honorable
body
we
say
that
we
are
willing
and
always
have
been
to
conform
to
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
and
of
this
state
we
ask
in
common
with
others
the
protection
of
the
laws
we
ask
for
the
privileges
guaranteed
all
free
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
of
this
state
to
be
extended
to
us
and
that
we
may
be
permitted
to
settle
and
live
where
we
please
and
worship
god
according
to
the
dictates
of
our
own
conscience
without
molestation
and
while
we
ask
for
ourselves
this
privilege
we
are
willing
all
others
should
enjoy
the
same
elder
david
redfield
was
appointed
to
present
this
petition
to
the
legislature
and
on
that
mission
he
arrived
at
jefferson
city
on
the
seventeenth
day
of
december
the
same
day
of
his
arrival
he
had
an
interview
with
governor
boggs
in
which
the
governor
manifested
much
interest
and
on
being
informed
that
the
missourians
were
committing
depredations
against
the
saints
promised
to
write
judge
king
and
colonel
price
ordering
them
to
put
down
every
hostile
appearance
in
the
course
of
this
conversation
boggs
admitted
that
the
stipulations
entered
into
by
the
mormons
to
leave
the
state
and
signing
the
deeds
of
trust
were
unconstitutional
and
not
valid
we
want
the
legislature
to
pass
a
law
to
that
effect
showing
that
the
stipulations
and
deeds
of
trust
are
not
valid
and
are
unconstitutional
said
redfield
and
went
on
to
say
if
they
did
not
the
character
of
the
state
was
forever
lost
previous
to
the
arrival
of
redfield
the
governor
exterminating
order
general
clark
reports
the
report
of
the
investigation
at
richmond
and
a
lot
of
other
papers
had
been
forwarded
to
the
legislature
and
referred
to
a
special
joint
committee
that
committee
reported
the
day
following
redfield
arrival
at
jefferson
city
the
eighteenth
of
december
and
to
show
in
what
bad
repute
these
documents
were
held
by
this
committee
i
need
only
say
that
it
refused
to
allow
them
to
be
published
with
the
sanction
of
the
legislature
because
the
evidence
adduced
at
richmond
in
a
great
degree
was
and
not
of
a
character
to
be
desired
for
the
basis
of
a
fair
and
candid
investigation
the
report
concluded
with
three
resolutions
one
to
the
effect
that
it
was
inexpedient
at
that
time
to
prosecute
further
the
inquiry
into
the
cause
of
the
late
disturbances
another
to
the
effect
that
it
was
inexpedient
to
publish
any
of
the
documents
accompanying
the
governor
message
in
relation
to
those
disturbances
the
last
favored
the
appointment
of
a
joint
committee
from
the
house
and
senate
to
investigate
the
troubles
and
the
conduct
of
the
military
operations
to
suppress
them
these
resolutions
were
subsequently
referred
to
a
joint
select
committee
with
instructions
to
report
a
bill
in
conformity
thereto
and
to
which
i
shall
again
allude
the
day
after
the
committee
reported
in
relation
to
that
part
of
the
governor
message
relating
to
the
mormon
troubles
and
on
the
documents
accompanying
it
the
petition
from
the
saints
was
read
amid
profound
stillness
of
the
house
and
at
its
conclusion
an
angry
debate
followed
in
which
quite
a
number
of
the
members
testified
to
the
correctness
of
the
statements
made
in
the
petition
and
to
the
cruelties
practiced
upon
the
saints
but
they
were
in
the
minority
on
the
sixteenth
of
january
turner
the
chairman
of
the
select
joint
committee
before
alluded
to
in
conformity
with
the
resolution
passed
reported
a
bill
to
provide
for
the
investigation
of
the
late
disturbances
in
the
state
of
missouri
the
bill
consisted
of
sections
it
provided
for
a
joint
committee
composed
of
two
members
of
the
senate
and
three
members
from
the
house
which
was
to
meet
at
richmond
on
the
first
monday
in
may
and
thereafter
at
such
time
and
places
as
it
saw
proper
the
committee
was
to
select
its
own
officers
issue
subpoenas
and
other
processes
administer
oaths
keep
a
record
etc
this
bill
was
introduced
on
the
sixteenth
of
january
and
on
the
fourth
of
february
called
up
for
its
first
reading
but
on
motion
of
wright
was
laid
on
the
table
till
the
fourth
of
july
he
knew
that
by
that
time
since
the
governor
exterminating
order
was
still
in
force
that
the
mormons
in
obedience
to
that
cruel
edict
would
all
have
left
the
state
and
then
there
would
be
no
need
of
an
investigation
that
was
the
fate
of
the
bill
it
was
never
afterwards
brought
up
the
legislature
in
its
magnanimity
appropriated
two
thousand
dollars
to
relieve
the
sufferings
of
the
people
in
daviess
and
caldwell
counties
the
mormons
were
to
be
included
and
now
came
an
opportunity
for
the
missourians
of
daviess
county
to
display
their
generosity
having
filled
their
homes
with
the
household
effects
of
the
saints
their
yards
with
the
stock
they
had
stolen
their
smoke
houses
with
mormon
beef
and
pork
they
concluded
they
could
get
along
without
their
portion
of
the
appropriation
and
allowed
the
two
thousand
dollars
to
be
distributed
among
the
mormons
of
caldwell
county
judge
cameron
and
a
mchenry
superintended
the
distribution
of
this
appropriation
the
hogs
owned
by
the
brethren
who
had
lived
in
daviess
county
were
driven
down
into
caldwell
shot
down
and
without
further
bleeding
were
roughly
dressed
and
divided
out
among
the
saints
at
a
high
price
this
and
the
sweepings
of
some
old
stores
soon
exhausted
the
legislative
appropriation
and
amounted
to
little
or
nothing
in
the
way
of
relief
to
the
saints
subsequently
this
same
legislature
while
the
petition
of
the
saints
for
a
redress
of
their
wrongs
was
lying
before
it
appropriated
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
to
defray
the
expenses
incurred
in
driving
the
mormons
from
the
state
and
dispossessing
them
of
their
property
by
that
act
the
legislature
became
a
party
to
the
deeds
of
the
mob
forces
urged
on
in
their
cruelties
by
the
executive
of
the
state
for
that
legislature
had
sealed
with
its
approval
all
that
had
been
done
by
paying
the
mob
that
had
executed
the
plan
devised
for
the
expulsion
of
the
mormon
people
chapter
xlvii
the
escape
of
the
prophet
from
missouri
the
winter
of
must
have
been
a
trying
one
to
joseph
the
prophet
and
his
associates
immured
in
liberty
prison
the
gloom
of
their
prison
life
must
have
caused
them
less
sorrow
than
the
anxiety
they
felt
for
the
safety
of
their
families
and
friends
who
were
being
abused
and
insulted
by
a
heartless
mob
even
while
making
arrangements
to
leave
the
state
still
there
were
occasional
glimpses
of
sunshine
breaking
through
the
clouds
some
of
the
faithful
brethren
called
occasionally
bringing
them
the
news
from
their
families
and
their
people
and
the
progress
being
made
in
the
preparations
to
leave
the
state
letters
also
from
their
families
were
brought
to
them
so
that
they
were
not
altogether
cut
off
from
that
sweet
communion
which
affection
breeds
nor
was
the
lord
unmindful
of
them
but
he
communed
with
them
and
through
the
prophet
joseph
some
of
the
noblest
revelations
ever
given
to
the
church
were
received
in
that
gloomy
stone
prison
known
as
liberty
jail
a
footnote
a
see
doc
cov
sec
and
nor
were
joseph
and
his
companions
neglectful
in
making
every
proper
effort
to
obtain
justice
from
the
state
authorities
on
the
contrary
they
exhausted
every
means
their
minds
could
conceive
of
to
regain
their
liberty
they
petitioned
the
legislature
but
without
availing
anything
failing
here
they
petitioned
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
twice
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
but
each
time
the
petition
was
denied
by
judge
reynolds
who
subsequently
became
governor
of
the
they
then
petitioned
the
county
court
and
in
about
three
weeks
afterwards
judge
turnham
came
into
their
prison
and
said
he
had
permitted
sidney
rigdon
to
get
bail
but
he
had
to
do
it
in
the
night
and
that
he
would
have
to
make
his
escape
in
the
night
as
his
enemies
had
sworn
they
would
kill
him
if
they
could
find
him
the
judge
said
that
he
dared
not
admit
the
others
to
bail
lest
it
should
cost
him
his
own
life
as
well
as
theirs
the
judge
informed
the
prisoners
that
the
whole
scheme
for
the
expulsion
from
the
state
of
the
mormon
people
was
arranged
early
in
the
spring
and
that
every
officer
in
the
state
from
the
governor
down
was
connected
with
the
plot
he
said
the
governor
was
now
heartily
sick
of
the
whole
transaction
and
would
grant
them
a
release
if
he
dared
but
the
matter
had
gone
beyond
his
control
however
the
judge
bid
the
prisoners
to
be
of
good
cheer
as
the
governor
had
arranged
a
plan
for
their
escape
in
april
the
prisoners
were
taken
to
daviess
county
where
they
expected
to
be
tried
here
they
found
judge
thomas
birch
on
the
bench
formerly
the
prosecuting
attorney
for
the
state
in
the
examination
of
the
prophet
and
his
companions
before
judge
king
at
richmond
and
the
man
who
was
connected
with
the
that
condemned
them
to
be
shot
in
the
public
square
at
far
west
they
were
arraigned
by
a
grand
jury
composed
of
men
connected
with
the
massacre
at
haun
mill
some
of
whom
while
under
the
influence
of
liquor
boasted
of
their
deeds
of
cruelty
at
that
horrible
butchery
this
grand
jury
did
double
service
during
the
day
it
acted
as
a
court
of
inquiry
at
night
members
of
it
were
chosen
by
turns
to
act
as
a
guard
over
the
prisoners
after
ten
days
passed
in
this
manner
the
jury
reported
indictments
against
the
prisoners
for
treason
murder
arson
theft
and
stealing
the
prisoners
asked
for
a
change
of
venue
to
marion
county
that
was
denied
but
one
was
given
them
to
boone
county
and
judge
birch
made
out
the
mittimus
without
date
name
or
place
and
the
prisoners
in
charge
of
the
sheriff
and
four
other
men
and
a
two
horse
team
and
wagon
started
for
boone
county
passing
through
diahman
the
prisoners
were
allowed
to
purchase
two
horses
of
the
guard
giving
some
clothing
for
one
and
their
note
for
the
other
the
third
day
out
from
gallatin
three
of
the
guards
and
the
sheriff
got
drunk
and
went
to
bed
the
sheriff
previously
having
shown
the
prisoners
the
mittimus
made
out
by
judge
birch
now
also
informed
them
that
birch
had
told
him
not
to
take
the
prisoners
to
boone
county
after
exposing
the
plan
that
had
been
laid
for
their
escape
by
the
authorities
the
sheriff
assured
the
prisoners
that
he
should
take
a
good
drink
of
whiskey
and
go
to
bed
and
they
could
do
as
they
pleased
accordingly
when
all
the
guards
but
one
were
asleep
that
one
who
by
the
way
was
sober
as
well
as
awake
assisted
them
to
mount
their
horses
and
escape
ten
days
later
they
arrived
among
their
friends
in
illinois
the
prophet
in
a
signed
summary
of
the
persecutions
endured
by
himself
and
his
people
in
missouri
says
before
leaving
missouri
i
had
paid
the
lawyers
at
richmond
thousand
dollars
in
cash
lands
one
lot
which
i
let
them
have
in
jackson
county
for
seven
thousand
dollars
they
were
soon
offered
ten
thousand
dollars
for
it
but
would
not
accept
it
for
other
vexatious
suits
which
i
had
to
contend
against
the
few
months
i
was
in
the
state
i
paid
lawyers
fees
to
the
amount
of
about
sixteen
thousand
dollars
making
in
all
about
fifty
thousand
dollars
for
which
i
received
very
little
in
return
for
sometimes
they
were
afraid
to
act
on
account
of
the
mob
and
sometimes
they
were
so
drunk
as
to
incapacitate
them
for
business
but
there
were
a
few
honorable
exceptions
among
those
who
have
been
the
chief
instruments
and
leading
characters
in
the
unparalleled
persecutions
against
the
church
of
saints
the
following
stand
conspicuous
viz
generals
clark
wilson
and
lucas
colonel
price
and
cornelius
gilliam
captain
bogart
also
whose
zeal
in
the
cause
of
oppression
and
injustice
was
unequalled
and
whose
delight
has
been
to
rob
murder
and
spread
devastation
among
the
saints
he
stole
a
valuable
horse
saddle
and
bridle
from
me
which
cost
two
hundred
dollars
and
then
sold
the
same
to
general
wilson
on
understanding
this
i
applied
to
general
wilson
for
the
horse
who
assured
me
upon
the
honor
of
a
gentleman
and
an
officer
that
i
should
have
the
horse
returned
to
me
but
this
promise
has
not
been
fulfilled
all
the
threats
murders
and
robberies
which
these
officers
have
been
guilty
of
are
entirely
overlooked
by
the
executive
of
the
state
who
to
hide
his
own
iniquity
must
of
course
shield
and
protect
those
whom
he
employed
to
carry
into
effect
his
murderous
purposes
i
was
in
their
hands
as
a
prisoner
about
six
months
but
notwithstanding
their
determination
to
destroy
me
with
the
rest
of
my
brethren
who
were
with
me
and
although
at
three
different
times
as
i
was
informed
we
were
sentenced
to
be
shot
without
the
least
shadow
of
law
as
we
were
not
military
men
and
had
the
time
and
place
appointed
for
that
purpose
yet
through
the
mercy
of
god
in
answer
to
the
prayers
of
the
saints
i
have
been
preserved
and
delivered
out
of
their
hands
and
can
again
enjoy
the
society
of
my
friends
and
brethren
whom
i
love
and
to
whom
i
feel
united
in
bonds
that
are
stronger
than
death
and
in
a
state
where
i
believe
the
laws
are
respected
and
whose
citizens
are
humane
and
charitable
during
the
time
i
was
in
the
hands
of
my
enemies
i
must
say
that
although
i
felt
great
anxiety
respecting
my
family
and
friends
who
were
so
inhumanly
treated
and
abused
and
who
had
to
mourn
the
loss
of
their
husbands
and
children
who
had
been
slain
and
after
having
been
robbed
of
nearly
all
that
they
possessed
were
driven
from
their
homes
and
forced
to
wander
as
strangers
in
a
strange
country
in
order
that
they
might
save
themselves
and
their
little
ones
from
the
destruction
they
were
threatened
with
in
missouri
yet
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
i
felt
perfectly
calm
and
resigned
to
the
will
of
my
heavenly
father
i
knew
my
innocency
as
well
as
that
of
the
saints
and
that
we
had
done
nothing
to
deserve
such
treatment
from
the
hands
of
our
oppressors
consequently
i
could
look
to
that
god
who
has
the
hearts
of
all
men
in
his
hands
and
who
had
saved
me
frequently
from
the
gates
of
death
for
deliverance
and
notwithstanding
that
every
avenue
of
escape
seemed
to
be
entirely
closed
and
death
stared
me
in
the
face
and
that
my
destruction
was
determined
upon
as
far
as
man
was
concerned
yet
from
my
first
entrance
into
the
camp
i
felt
an
assurance
that
i
with
my
brethren
and
our
families
would
be
delivered
yes
that
still
small
voice
which
has
so
often
whispered
consolation
to
my
soul
in
the
depth
of
sorrow
and
distress
bade
me
be
of
good
cheer
and
promised
deliverance
which
gave
me
great
comfort
and
although
the
heathen
raged
and
the
people
imagined
vain
things
yet
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
jacob
was
my
refuge
and
when
i
cried
unto
him
in
the
day
of
trouble
he
delivered
me
for
which
i
call
upon
my
soul
and
all
that
is
within
me
to
bless
and
praise
his
holy
name
for
although
i
was
troubled
on
every
side
yet
not
distressed
perplexed
but
not
in
despair
persecuted
but
not
forsaken
cast
down
but
not
destroyed
the
conduct
of
the
saints
under
their
accumulated
wrongs
and
sufferings
has
been
praiseworthy
their
courage
in
defending
their
brethren
from
the
ravages
of
the
mobs
their
attachment
to
the
cause
of
truth
under
circumstances
the
most
trying
and
distressing
which
humanity
can
possibly
endure
their
love
to
each
other
their
readiness
to
afford
assistance
to
me
and
my
brethren
who
were
confined
in
a
dungeon
their
sacrifices
in
leaving
missouri
and
assisting
the
poor
widows
and
orphans
and
securing
them
houses
in
a
more
hospitable
land
all
conspire
to
raise
them
in
the
estimation
of
all
good
and
virtuous
men
and
has
secured
them
the
favor
and
approbation
of
jehovah
and
a
name
as
imperishable
as
eternity
and
their
virtuous
deeds
and
heroic
actions
while
in
defense
of
truth
and
their
brethren
will
be
fresh
and
blooming
when
the
names
of
their
oppressors
shall
be
either
entirely
forgotten
or
only
remembered
for
their
barbarity
and
cruelty
their
attention
and
affection
to
me
while
in
prison
will
ever
be
remembered
by
me
and
when
i
have
seen
them
thrust
away
and
abused
by
the
jailer
and
guard
when
they
came
to
do
any
kind
offices
and
to
cheer
our
minds
while
we
were
in
the
gloomy
prisonhouse
gave
me
feelings
which
i
can
not
describe
while
those
who
wished
to
insult
and
abuse
us
by
their
threats
and
blasphemous
language
were
applauded
and
had
every
encouragement
given
them
however
thank
god
we
have
been
delivered
and
although
some
of
our
beloved
brethren
have
had
to
seal
their
testimony
with
their
blood
and
have
died
martyrs
to
the
cause
of
truth
yet
short
though
bitter
was
their
pain
everlasting
is
their
joy
let
us
not
sorrow
as
those
without
hope
the
time
is
fast
approaching
when
we
shall
see
them
again
and
rejoice
together
without
being
afraid
of
wicked
men
yes
those
who
have
slept
in
christ
shall
he
bring
with
him
when
he
shall
come
to
be
glorified
in
him
and
admired
by
all
those
who
believe
but
to
take
vengeance
upon
his
enemies
and
all
those
who
obey
not
the
gospel
at
that
time
the
hearts
of
the
widows
and
fatherless
shall
be
comforted
and
every
tear
shall
be
wiped
from
off
their
faces
the
trials
they
have
had
to
pass
through
shall
work
together
for
their
good
and
prepare
them
for
the
society
of
those
who
have
come
up
out
of
great
tribulation
and
have
washed
their
robes
and
made
them
white
in
the
blood
of
the
lamb
marvel
not
then
if
you
are
persecuted
but
remember
the
words
of
the
savior
the
servant
is
not
above
his
lord
if
they
have
persecuted
me
they
will
persecute
you
also
and
that
all
the
afflictions
through
which
the
saints
have
to
pass
are
in
fulfillment
of
the
words
of
all
the
prophets
which
have
spoken
since
the
world
began
we
shall
therefore
do
well
to
discern
the
signs
of
the
times
as
we
pass
along
that
the
day
of
the
lord
may
not
overtake
us
as
a
thief
in
the
night
afflictions
persecutions
imprisonments
and
deaths
we
must
expect
according
to
the
scriptures
which
tell
us
that
the
blood
of
those
whose
souls
were
under
the
altar
could
not
be
avenged
on
them
that
dwell
on
the
earth
until
their
brethren
should
be
slain
as
they
were
if
these
transactions
had
taken
place
among
barbarians
under
the
authority
of
a
despot
or
in
a
nation
where
a
certain
religion
is
established
according
to
law
and
all
others
proscribed
then
there
might
have
been
some
shadow
of
defense
offered
but
can
we
realize
that
in
a
land
which
is
the
cradle
of
liberty
and
equal
rights
and
where
the
voice
of
the
conquerors
who
had
vanquished
our
foes
had
scarcely
died
away
upon
our
ears
where
we
frequently
mingled
with
those
who
had
stood
amidst
the
battle
and
the
breeze
and
whose
arms
have
been
nerved
in
the
defense
of
their
country
and
liberty
whose
institutions
are
the
theme
of
philosophers
and
poets
and
held
up
to
the
admiration
of
the
whole
civilized
world
in
the
midst
of
all
these
scenes
with
which
we
were
surrounded
a
persecution
the
most
unwarrantable
was
commenced
and
a
tragedy
the
most
dreadful
was
enacted
by
a
large
portion
of
the
inhabitants
of
one
of
those
free
and
independent
states
which
comprise
this
vast
republic
and
a
deadly
blow
was
struck
at
the
institutions
for
which
our
fathers
had
fought
many
a
hard
battle
and
for
which
many
a
patriot
had
shed
his
blood
and
suddenly
was
heard
amidst
the
voice
of
joy
and
gratitude
for
our
national
liberty
the
voice
of
mourning
lamentation
and
woe
yes
in
this
land
a
mob
regardless
of
those
laws
for
which
so
much
blood
had
been
spilled
dead
to
every
feeling
of
virtue
and
patriotism
which
animated
the
bosom
of
free
men
fell
upon
a
people
whose
religious
faith
was
different
from
their
own
and
not
only
destroyed
their
homes
drove
them
away
and
carried
off
their
property
but
murdered
many
a
son
of
america
a
tragedy
which
has
no
parallel
in
modern
and
hardly
in
ancient
times
even
the
face
of
the
red
man
would
be
ready
to
turn
pale
at
the
recital
of
it
it
would
have
been
some
consolation
if
the
authorities
of
the
state
had
been
innocent
in
this
affair
but
they
are
involved
in
the
guilt
thereof
and
the
blood
of
innocence
even
of
cries
for
vengeance
upon
them
i
ask
the
citizens
of
this
vast
republic
whether
such
a
state
of
things
is
to
be
suffered
to
pass
unnoticed
and
the
hearts
of
widows
orphans
and
patriots
to
be
broken
and
their
wrongs
left
without
redress
no
i
invoke
the
genius
of
our
constitution
i
appeal
to
the
patriotism
of
americans
to
stop
this
unlawful
and
unholy
procedure
and
pray
that
god
may
defend
this
nation
from
the
dreadful
effects
of
such
outrages
is
there
not
virtue
in
the
body
politic
will
not
the
people
rise
in
their
majesty
and
with
that
promptitude
and
zeal
which
is
so
characteristic
of
them
discountenance
such
proceedings
by
bringing
the
offenders
to
that
punishment
which
they
so
richly
deserve
and
save
the
nation
from
that
disgrace
and
ultimate
ruin
which
otherwise
must
inevitably
fall

chapter

a
prophecy
that
did
not
fail
before
concluding
this
writing
i
wish
to
refer
to
a
matter
before
briefly
alluded
to
on
july
the
lord
had
given
a
revelation
to
the
twelve
apostles
through
joseph
the
prophet
in
which
john
taylor
john
page
wilford
woodruff
and
willard
richards
were
chosen
to
fill
the
vacancies
in
the
quorum
of
the
twelve
and
the
apostles
were
to
take
leave
of
the
saints
in
far
west
on
the
day
of
april
on
the
building
spot
of
the
lord
house
and
from
thence
depart
over
the
great
waters
to
preach
the
gospel
in
foreign
lands
it
had
been
the
constant
boast
of
the
mob
throughout
the
persecutions
we
have
been
relating
that
this
was
one
of
joe
smith
revelations
at
least
that
should
not
be
fulfilled
yet
at
the
time
appointed
the
day
of
april
five
of
the
twelve
apostles
arrived
there
having
come
from
quincy
by
various
routes
to
elude
the
vigilance
of
their
enemies
together
with
a
number
of
elders
high
priests
and
priests
the
five
apostles
ordained
wilford
woodruff
and
george
smith
members
of
their
quorum
thus
making
the
number
of
apostles
present
seven
a
majority
of
the
twelve
and
hence
competent
to
transact
business
as
a
quorum
they
also
ordained
a
number
to
the
office
of
seventy
they
excommunicated
a
number
of
persons
from
the
church
prayer
was
offered
up
by
the
apostles
in
the
order
of
their
standing
in
the
quorum

hymn
known
to
the

was
sung
after
this
hymn
was
sung

the
of
the
lord
house
laid
the
corner
stone
in
its
position
and
then
said
in
consequence
of
the
peculiar
situation
of
the
saints
it
was
deemed
prudent
to
discontinue
further
labor
on
the
house
until
the
lord
should
open
the
way
for
its
completion
the
apostles
then
took
leave
of
some
seventeen
saints
who
were
present
and
started
on
their
way
to
fill
their
missions
beyond
the
great
atlantic
ocean
thus
was
fulfilled
that
revelation
in
every
particular
notwithstanding
the
boasts
of
the
mob
which
said
it
should
fail
of
fulfillment
so
important
do
i
deem
the
fulfillment
of
this
prophecy

a
state
shame
this
brings
me
to
the
close
of
the
story
of
the
missouri
persecutions
we
have
seen
a
people
start
out
under
the
direction
of
the
lord
to
build
up
the
city
of
zion
to
his
holy
name
but
because
of
their
disobedience
and
failure
to
observe
strictly
those
conditions
upon
which
the
lord
had
promised
them
success
in
accomplishing
so
great
a
work
they
were
driven
entirely
from
that
county
and
state
where
that
city
is
to
be
founded
we
have
seen
a
proud
sovereign
state
of
the
great
american
union
with
a
constitution
that
guaranteed
the
largest
possible
religious
and
civil
liberty
to
its
citizens
ignore
both
the
spirit
and
letter
of
that
constitution
we
have
seen
its
officers
shamefully
violate
the
laws
passed
in
pursuance
of
it
and
from
the
chief
executive
down
enter
into
plots
to
destroy
the
saints
of
god
or
drive
them
from
the
state
in
accomplishing
which
they
were
guilty
of
the
most
cruel
barbarity
it
is
no
palliation
of
their
offense
to
say
that
the
saints
had
not
strictly
kept
the
commandments
of
god
their
offenses
were
against
the
laws
of
god
rather
than
the
laws
of
man
delinquencies
that
fell
not
under
the
power
of
the
state
to
correct
so
far
as
the
state
of
missouri
was
concerned
she
was
not
justified
in
trampling
on
her
own
constitution
and
laws
and
permitting
not
only
her
people
but
the
officers
of
the
state
to
commit
outrages
against
an
innocent
people
that
would
put
savages
to
the
blush
of
shame
i
impeach
the
state
of
missouri
before
the
bar
of
nineteenth
century
civilization
and
affirm
that
in
the
five
years
between
and
she
permitted
and
became
a
party
to
acts
of
robbery
violence
and
blood
which
are
a
disgrace
to
the
age
and
its
boasted
spirit
of
progress
and
toleration
i
charge
that
missouri
was
guilty
of
crimes
the
perpetration
of
which
forbids
the
claim
that
in
the
united
states
of
america
and
in
this
enlightened
century
there
has
been
an
abandonment
of
the
barbarities
of
past
ages
before
the
great
bar
of
history
i
impeach
the
state
of
missouri
in
the
years
from
to
there
were
committed
within
her
borders
and
against
an
unoffending
and
people
acts
of
shameful
robbery
arson
willful
wanton
slaughter
of
men
women
and
children
worst
of
all
rape
upon
virtuous
wives
and
maidens
and
at
the
last
illegal
banishment
of
some
twelve
thousand
people
from
the
state
for
these
crimes
repeatedly
committed
and
numerous
no
offender
was
ever
brought
to
punishment
by
the
state
on
the
contrary
the
machinery
of
its
government
was
employed
and
its
officers
exerted
themselves
to
further
oppress
the
innocent
sufferers
so
that
instead
of
being
a
means
for
their
protection
the
government
was
made
an
engine
for
their
oppression
and
its
legislature
turning
a
deaf
ear
to
the
story
of
their
wrongs
made
liberal
appropriations
from
the
state
treasury
to
defray
the
expenses
of
those
who
committed
the
outrages
against
them
and
drove
them
from
the
state
i
impeach
the
state
of
missouri
before
the
bar
of
american
constitutions
and
institutions
and
charge
that
in
the
crimes
permitted
and
by
her
officers
perpetrated
against
the
saints
in
the
five
years
between
and
she
both
deserted
and
violated
the
principles
of
government
upon
which
the
state
is
founded
by
failing
nay
worse
by
refusing
at
first
to
protect
by
the
majesty
and
righteous
execution
of
her
laws
and
next
by
becoming
an
assailant
and
robber
of
the
unoffending
saints
she
denied
to
them
and
deprived
them
of
the
right
to
property
the
right
to
pursue
happiness
the
right
to
be
free
the
right
to
worship
god
after
the
dictates
of
their
own
consciences
and
by
denying
to
them
and
depriving
them
of
these
rights
missouri
violated
the
fundamental
principles
of
american
government
and
outraged
american
institutions
lastly
i
charge
missouri
historians
both
those
who
have
written
the
history
of
the
counties
in
which
the
outrages
i
have
detailed
occurred
as
well
as
the
historians
of
the
state
at
large
with
having
glazed
over
these
deeds
of
infamy
they
have
either
withheld
or
misrepresented
the
facts
and
have
descended
so
low
as
to
become
apologists
for
the
state
and
the
officers
that
could
perpetrate
and
become
a
party
to
such
acts
of
injustice
rapine
and
murder
the
statements
of
fact
in
these
pages
are
irrefutable
and
easy
of
verification
they
can
neither
be
successfully
denied
gainsaid
nor
explained
away
nor
can
the
impeachment
of
the
state
of
missouri
before
the
bar
of
history
civilization
or
of
american
institutions
the
otherwise
grand
state
of
missouri
is
stained
with
dishonor
because
of
her
treatment
of
the
saints
on
her
escutcheon
is
to
be
seen
the
blotch
of
innocent
blood
unavenged
in
undertaking
the
task
of
writing
this
history
the
one
thought
above
all
others
in
my
mind
has
been
the
desire
to
present
to
the
youth
of
the
saints
many
of
whose
fathers
passed
through
these
trying
scenes
with
a
circumstantial
account
of
them
that
they
might
know
how
much
was
endured
by
their
fathers
for
the
truth
sake
that
they
might
learn
to
prize
it
not
only
for
what
it
is
in
itself
but
also
to
prize
it
to
some
degree
for
what
it
cost
the
fathers
but
at
the
close
of
my
task
i
find
myself
convinced
that
it
is
equally
important
that
the
people
of
missouri
and
of
the
united
states
should
have
the
plain
facts
presented
to
them
that
they
may
not
unwittingly
as
the
general
tendency
now
is
become
in
a
manner
parties
to
the
crime
by
approving
what
was
done
in
that
period
and
thus
fall
under
the
displeasure
of
god
whose
words
are
equally
strong
against
those
who
shed
the
blood
of
the
saints
and
the
prophets
and
those
who
applaud
such
crimes

missouri
published

historical
kansas
city
missouri
a
very
prominent
feature
of
the
early
history
of
jackson
county
was
the
trouble
between
the
mormons
and
other
citizens
during
and
which
led
to
the
expulsion
of
the
former
from
the
county
during
the
latter
part
of
the
year
this
sect
was
brought
into
existence
on
the
sixth
day
of
april
near
manchester
new

the
first
society
consisted
of
six
persons
joseph

joseph

samuel
smith
oliver
cowdery
and
joseph
knight
the
three
smiths
last
mentioned
were
brothers
and
sons
of
joseph
smith
and
joseph
smith
was
the
reputed
author
of
the
new
faith
and
is
the
prophet
of
mormon
history
this
smith
family
came
from
vermont
where
joseph
was
born
at
sharon
in
windsor
county
december
they
are
represented
by
their
neighbors
both
in
vermont
and
new
york
to
have
been
a
shiftless
worthless
family
the
parents
are
represented
as
having
been
dishonest
unreliable
ignorant
and
superstitious
and
the
sons
seemed
to
have
inherited
all
these
peculiarities
a
part
of
the
business
of
the
father
was
that
of
water
witch
in
which
capacity
he
went
about
the
country
with
a
hazel
rod
divining
where
water
could
be
found
by
digging
wells
by
the
writhings
of
the
rod
when
held
in
the
hands
in
a
peculiar
manner
young
joseph
is
reported
to
have
been
a
wild
reckless
boy
dishonest
untruthful
and
intemperate
as
he
grew
toward
adult
age
he
adopted
his
father
profession
of
and
afterwards
added
to
it
the
more
practical
business
of
digging
the
wells
he
thus
located
while
in
this
capacity
he
discovered
a
smooth
round
stone
of
peculiar
shape
while
digging
a
well
for
a
chase
near
manchester
this
he
adopted
as
a
peep
stone
and
pretended
that
by
placing
it
in
his
hat
in
a
peculiar
way
it
had
the
miraculous
power
of
revealing
to
him
where
lost
and
stolen
articles
could
be
found
and
he
then
added
this
to
his
previous
miraculous
business
of
during
the
decade
from
to
a
great
religious
revival
swept
over
the
country
and
gave
rise
to
the
phenomena
known
as
jerks
this
excitement
raged
greatly
in
western
new
york
and
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
smiths
joseph
and
some
of
his
sisters
and
brothers
became
converted
at
one
of
the
revivals
but
joseph
was
greatly
vexed
in
spirit
by
the
uncertainty
as
to
which
of
the
sects
was
the
right
one
he
became
a
constant
reader
of
the
bible
for
a
time
but
subsequently
fell
again
into
his
old
ways
and
later
events
indicate
that
he
fell
also
into
some
new
ones
which
have
extended
the
peculiarities
of
his
nature
much
beyond
the
sphere
of
his
personal
influence
and
beyond
the
period
of
his
time
he
put
forth
the
claim
that
in
september
god
sent
messengers
to
him
to
say
that
he
was
forgiven
for
his
sins
again
in
he
claimed
an
angel
visited
him
with
the
information
that
in
the
hill
cumorah
not
far
from
manchester
were
hidden
certain
golden
plates
which
he
was
to
unearth
and
translate
these
plates
were
exhumed
in
september
as
joseph
represents
it
with
a
mighty
display
of
celestial
machinery
and
were
delivered
by
the
angels
to
him
these
plates
were
afterwards
translated
by
joseph
smith
oliver
cowdery
a
and
one
martin
harris
and
published
in
the
early
part
of
the
year
as
the
book
of
mormon
another
account
of
the
origin
of
the
book
of
mormon
is
that
it
was
written
as
a
historical
romance
to
account
for
the
indians
in
america
in
by
a
solomon
spaulding
a
retired
preacher
and
presented
to
patterson
a
bookseller
in
pittsburg
for
publication
together
with
a
preface
representing
it
to
have
been
taken
from
plates
dug
up
in
ohio
patterson
did
not
think
the
enterprise
would
pay
and
hence
did
not
publish
it
but
sidney
rigdon
afterwards
quite
noted
in
early
mormon
history
was
then
at
work
in
the
office
of
patterson
and
it
is
suggested
that
he
stole
the
manuscripts
and
had
his
full
share
in
bringing
mormonism
into
existence
though
he
did
not
appear
in
connection
with
it
for
some
months
after
the
organization
of
the
first
society
but
however
the
book
may
have
come
joseph
smith
appears
from
the
first
as
prophet
and
directed
the
movements
of
the
new
sect
by
what
he
claimed
to
be
divine
revelations
and
put
forth
the
most
extravagant
claims
for
himself
and
his
prophetic
powers
this
was
a
time
particularly
favorable
for
the
cultivation
of
such
a
superstition
the
religious
ideas
prevailing
at
the
time
of
the
religious
excitement
referred
to
embraced
the
belief
in
the
direct
dealings
of
god
with
man
very
much
after
the
manner
represented
in
ancient
jewish
history
which
made
such
pretenses
as
these
peculiarly
liable
to
be
accepted
immediately
after
the
organization
of
the
first
society
as
above
stated
there
was
an
administration
of
the
sacrament
and
the
laying
on
of
hands
for
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
five
days
afterward
on
the
of
may
oliver
cowdery
preached
the
first
sermon
on
the
new
faith
and
before
the
close
of
the
month
at
colesville
browne
a
county
new
york
there
was
what
was
claimed
by
the
new
sect
to
be
miracles
performed
from
this
the
new
sect
took
strong
root
with
the
ignorant
and
superstitious
and
it
gained
members
rapidly
notwithstanding
the
prophet
was
several
times
arrested
for
misdemeanors
in
august

the
work

became
very
active
and
effective
smith
put
forth
a
revelation
that
mundane
things
were
about
to
be
brought
to
an
end
a
claim
that
was
likely
to
strike
terror
into
the
hearts
of
the
ignorant
and
superstitious
after
the
strong
religious
excitement
that
had
been
prevailing
and
with
the
ideas
of
hell
and
the
future
state
at
that
time
current
in
theology
this
was
industriously
proclaimed
by
the
preachers
and
accompanied
with
the
narration
of
smith
miracle
and
the
injunction
to
seek
safety
in
the
new
church
its
effect
upon
the
ignorant
and
superstitious
was
very
great
and
by
october
the
society
numbered
fifty
and
by
june
about
two
thousand
rigdon
having
taken
up
his
residence
near
kirtland
ohio
had
gathered
around
him
about
fifty
very
fanatical
people
in
january
he
visited
smith
in
new
york
and
smith
returned
with
him
to
kirtland
and
soon
afterward
there
was
a
gathering
of
all
the
adherents
at
kirtland
this
is
known
in
mormon
history
as
the
first
hegira
the
sect
at
this
time
as
at
all
others
was
composed
of
ignorant
superstitious
and
fanatical
people
prepared
by
these
qualities
to
accept
anything
marvelous
that
might
be
told
them
or
to
do
anything
to
which
they
might
be
directed
by
one
imposed
upon
them
as
a
prophet
or
something
demanded
of
them
by
the
lord
such
were
the
character
of
the
people
whom
smith
attempted
to
settle
in
jackson
county
in
june
smith
put
forth
a
revelation
to
the
effect
that
the
final
gathering
place
of
the
saints
which
name
they
had
now
assumed
was
to
be
in
missouri
accordingly
he
set
out
with
a
few
elders
for
the
new
land
of
promise
arriving
at
independence
in
july
here
he
put
forth
another
revelation
stating
that
this
was
the
land
or
as
he
put
it
the
zion
that
should
never
be
moved
and
that
the
whole
land
was
solemnly
dedicated
to
the
lord
and
his
saints
they
began
at
once
to
build
and
at
first
erected
a
log
house
in
kaw
township
about
twelve
miles
from
independence
on
the
of
august
he
gave
out
another
revelation
that
the
site
of
the
great
temple
was
three
hundred
yards
west
of
the
court
house
in
independence
and
accordingly
on
the
of
august
the
spot
was
taken
possession
of
by
joseph
smith
sidney
rigdon
edward
partridge
phelps
oliver
cowdery
martin
harris
and
joseph
coe
and
dedicated
with
great
ceremony
and
followed
by
an
accession
of
gifts
from
god
the
next
day
august
another
and
larger
party
arrived
from
kirtland
and
the
first
general
conference
in
the
land
of
zion
was
immediately
held
during
this
conference
smith
gave
utterance
to
another
revelation
stating
that
the
whole
land
should
be
theirs
and
should
not
be
obtained
but
by
purchase
or
by
blood
the
situation
surroundings
and
leadership
of
these
people
seemed
to
impress
their
ignorant
and
superstitious
minds
with
the
idea
that
they
were
a
chosen
people
designed
in
the
purposes
of
god
to
effect
some
great
reformation
in
the
world
and
they
seemed
to
have
imagined
that
they
occupied
a
similar
position
to
that
assigned
by

ancient
jews
at
the
time
of
their
escape
from
egyptian
bondage
and
replanting
in
canaan
from
this
extravagance
the
way
to
others
was
open
easy
and
natural
in
their
poverty
the
purchase
of
the
whole
land
by
them
was
manifestly
not
intended
and
hence
they
seemed
to
expect
that
in
some
way
the
lord
would
establish
them
in
the
possession
of
missouri
without
that
assuming
this
that
they
were
the
holy
people
of
the
lord
that
the
lord
was
the
real
owner
of
all
things
and
that
all
his
possessions
were
free

them
they
were
not
calculated
to
be
respectful
of

and
interest
of
their
mormon
neighbors
though
no
overt
acts
of
transgression
upon
such
rights
were
being
committed
d
the
rapidly
gathering
members
of
the

ignorance

and
fanaticism

boastfulness
and
assurance
with
which

reiterated

belief
in
their
destined
possession

the
country
backed
by
smith
significant
revelations
and
the
dishonesty
of
the
methods
of
the

made
the
new
sect
an
object
of
profound
solicitude

in
august
following
the
general
conference
smith
and
rigdon
returned
to
kirtland
where
they
established
a
mill
and
a
bank
the
latter
being
an
irresponsible
wild
cat
concern
that
failed
soon
after
its
notes
were
well
afloat
which
failure
was
attended
by
another
revelation
to
smith
directing
him
and
rigdon
to
depart
at
night
for
missouri
soon
after
their
arrival
at
kirtland
in

phelps
was
appointed
to
purchase
a
press
and
establish
a
church
paper
in
independence
to
be
called
the
and
morning
the
prospectus
for
this
paper
appeared
in
february
and
the
paper
itself
in
june
following
on
the
of
march
smith
and
rigdon
while
away
from
home
were
seized
by
a
mob
and
tarred
feathered
and
beaten
for
attempting
to
establish
communism
and
for
forgery
and
dishonest
dealings
in
april
smith
being
at
independence
a
council
was
held
and
the
printing
press
set
up
with
religious
ceremonies
in
june
the
paper
made
its
appearance
and
further
excited
the
apprehensions
of
the
citizens
by
an
article
on
free
people
of
color
which
was
understood
by
the
population
of
missouri
to
mean
that
the
new
sect
were
what
was
then
appropriately
called
abolitionists
and
which
in
the
excitement
of
that
time
about
slavery
were
as
obnoxious
to
as
though
they
possessed
the
cloven
foot
this
was
a
further
cause
of
apprehension
and
led
to
a
reply
in
a
pamphlet
entitled
beware
of
false
prophets
in
the
spring
of
the
mormons
numbered
fifteen
hundred
in
jackson
county
they
had
nearly
taken
possession
of
independence
and
were
rapidly
extending
their
settlements
they
grew
bolder
as
they
grew
stronger
and
daily
proclaimed
to
the
older
settlers
that
the
lord
had
given
them
the
whole
land
of
missouri
that
bloody
wars
would
extirpate
all
other
sects
from
the
country
that
it
would
be
one
gore
of
blood
from
the
mississippi
to
the
border
and
that
the
few
who
were
left
unslain
would
be
the
servants
of
the
saints
who
would
own
all
the
property
in
the
country
at
the
same
time
they
fell
into
equal
extravagance
regarding
spiritual
things
and
declared
themselves
kings
and
priests
of
the
most
high
god
and
all
other
religious
sects
as
reprobates
the
creation
of
the
devil
designed
to
speedy
destruction
and
that
all
but
themselves
were
doomed
cast
away
gentiles
worse
than
the
heathen
and
unfit
to
live
they
notified
all
gentiles
who
were
building
new
houses
and
opening
new
farms
that
it
was
needless
that
the
lord
would
never
allow
them
to
enjoy
the
fruits
of
their
labor
and
that
in
a
few
months
the
gentiles
would
have
neither
name
nor
place
in
missouri
at
the
same
time
that
these
extravagances
were
thus
indulged
there
does
not
appear
to
have
been
any
more
lawlessness
among
them
or
by
them
than
would
result
from
any
equal
number
of
low
ignorant
people
so
that
while
their
presence
was
rapidly
becoming
insufferable
were
doing
nothing
that
would
warrant
their
legal
e
still
their
numbers
constantly
increased
by
accessions
from
the
east
and
from
time
to
time
large
and
enthusiastic
meetings
were
held
in
addition
to
their
paper
they
had
established
a
church
store
in
independence
which
was
kept
by
bishop
partridge
during
the
spring
and
summer
it
began
to
be
manifest
that
they
would
be
strong
enough
at
the
fall
election
to
control
the
election
of
officers
and
the
other
settlers
could
not
regard
except
with
grave
apprehension
the
filling
of
the
county
offices
by
members
of
such
a
sect
these
apprehensions
were
intensified
by
scandalous
stories
which
about
this
time
began
to
reach
missouri
about
the
leaders
of
the
sect
in
ohio
and
as
the
feeling
of
apprehension
increased
there
arose
a
state
of
restlessness
and
friction
closely
bordering
upon
open
hostility
however
beyond
some
mutual
petty
annoyances
such
as
throwing
stones
at
houses
breaking
down
fences
there
was
no
open
action
taken
until
the
of
july
when
a
number
of
citizens
about
four
hundred
assembled
to
take
action
on
the
situation

the
following
account
of
this
meeting
is
taken
from
a
report
published
in
the
monitor
at
that
time
published
by
weston
birch
at
fayette
mo
the
meeting
was
organized
by
calling
colonel
richard
sampson
to
the
chair
and
appointing
james
flournoy
and
colonel
samuel
lucas
as
secretaries
russell
hicks
robert
johnson
henry
childs
colonel
james
hambriglet
thomas
hudspeth
joel
chiles
and
james
hunter
were
appointed
to
draft
an
address
the
meeting
then
adjourned
and
convened
again
when
the
following
was
presented
this
meeting
professing
to
act
not
from
the
excitement
of
the
moment
but
under
a
deep
and
abiding
conviction
that
the
occasion
is
one
that
calls
for
cool
deliberation
as
well
as
energetic
action
deem
it
proper
to
lay
before
the
public
an
of
our
peculiar
situation
in
regard
to
this
singular
sect
of
pretended
christians
and
a
solemn
declaration
of
our
unalterable
determination
to
amend
it
the
evil
is
one
that
no
one
could
have
foreseen
and
it
is
therefore
unprovided
for
by
the
laws
and
the
delays
of
legislation
would
put
the
mischief
beyond
remedy
but
little
more
than
two
years
ago
some
two
or
three
of
these
people
made
their
appearance
in
the
upper
missouri
and
they
now
number
some
twelve
hundred
souls
in
this
county
and
each
successive
autumn
and
spring
pours
forth
its
swarms
among
us
with
a
gradual
falling
of
the
character
of
those
who
compose
them
until
it
seems
that
those
communities
from
which
they
come
were
flooding
us
with
the
very
dregs
of
their
composition
elevated
as
they
mostly
are
but
little
above
the
condition
of
our
blacks
either
in
regard
to
property
or
education
they
have
become
a
subject
of
much
anxiety
on
that
point
serious
and
complaints
having
already
been
made
of
their
corrupting
influence
on
our
slaves
when
we
reflect
on
the
extensive
field
in
which
the
sect
is
operating
and
that
there
exists
in
every
country
a
leaven
of
superstition
that
embraces
with
avidity
notions
the
most
extravagant
and
and
whatever
can
be
gleaned
by
them
from
the
purlieus
of
vice
and
the
abodes
of
ignorance
it
is
to
be
cast
like
a
waif
into
our
social
circles
it
requires
no
gift
of
prophecy
to
tell
that
the
day
is
not
far
distant
when
the
civil
government
of
the
county
will
be
in
their
hands
when
the
sheriff
the
justices
and
the
county
judges
will
be
or
persons
wishing
to
court
their
favor
from
motives
of
interest
or
ambition
what
would
be
the
fate
of
our
lives
and
property
in
the
hands
of
jurors
and
witnesses
who
do
not
blush
to
declare
and
would
not
upon
occasion
hesitate
to
swear
that
they
have
wrought
miracles
and
have
been
the
subjects
of
miraculous
and
supernatural
cures
have
conversed
with
god
and
his
angels
and
possess
and
exercise
the
gifts
of
divination
and
of
unknown
tongues
and
fired
with
the
prospect
of
obtaining
inheritances
without
money
and
without
price
may
be
better
imagined
than
described
and
we
do
hereby
most
solemnly
declare
that
no
shall
in
future
move
into
and
settle
in
this
county
that
those
now
here
shall
give
a
definite
pledge
of
their
intention
within
a
reasonable
time
to
move
out
of
the
county
shall
be
allowed
to
remain
unmolested
until
they
have
sufficient
time
to
sell
their
property
and
close
their
business
without
any
material
sacrifice
that
the
editor
of
the
be
required
forthwith
to
close
his
office
etc
that
those
who
fail
to
comply
with
these
requisitions
be
referred
to
those
of
their
brethren
who
have
the
gift
of
divination
and
of
unknown
tongues
to
inform
them
of
the
lot
that
awaits
them
compliance
with
these
demands
being
refused
the
people
assembled
tore
down
the
printing
office
scattering
the
materials
and
paper
on
the
ground
and
took
bishop
partridge
and
a
man
named
charles
allen
to
the
public
square
where
they
stripped
and
tarred
and
feathered
them
gilbert
who
was
now
connected
with
the
store
agreed
to
close
it
and
the
mob
then
dispersed
until
the
on
the
of
july
this
convention
of
citizens
again
convened
and
a
committee
was
appointed
to
confer
with
the
mormon
leaders
this
committee
was
met
by
phelps
partridge
gilbert
and
covil
whitmer
and
morley
elders
of
the
sect
between
them
an
agreement
was
made
to
the
effect
that
oliver
cowdery
phelps
william
mclellin
edward
partridge
lyman
wight
simeon
carter
peter
and
john
whitmer
and
harvey
whitlock
were
to
remove
from
the
county
on
or
before

and
were
to
use
their
influence
to
secure
the
removal
of
all
the
saints
by
january
the
other
half
by
april
john
corril
and
algernon
gilbert
were
to
be
allowed
to
remain
as
agents
to
settle
up
the
business
of
those
removing
the
was
not
again
to
be
published
nor
any
other
press
set
up
in
the
county
phelps
and
partridge
if
their
families
removed
by
january
were
to
be
allowed
to
come
and
go
in
settling
up
their
business
the
committee
of
citizens
pledged
themselves
to
use
their
influence
to
see
that
no
violence
was
to
be
used
against
the
saints
while
compliance
to
the
agreement
was
being
observed
this
agreement
as
reported
to
the
meeting
was
unanimously
adopted
by
the
citizens
and
the
minutes
signed
by
the
chairman
richard
sampson
and
the
secretaries
lucas
flournoy
in
september
orson
hyde
and
phelps
were
appointed
by
the
mormons
as
a
delegation
to
governor
dunklin
then
governor
of
missouri
and
to
represent
the
affairs
already
recited
and
to
ask
for
protection
they
prepared
and
presented
to
the
governor
october
a
long
memorial
setting
forth
a
long
list
of
grievances
wrongs
and
intimidations
which
they
had
suffered
at
the
hands
of
the
people
of
jackson
county
the
being
absent
governor
dunklin
declined
to
take
any
action
until
his
return
so
that
it
was
not
until
the
of
october
that
they
received
his
decision
the
case
presented
to
him
was
an
one
and
it
received
a
decision
which
led
the
mormon
leaders
to
rely
upon
his
protection
he
denied
the
right
of
any
citizens
to
take
into
their
own
hands
the
redress
of
the
grievances
and
recommended
the
mormons
to
appeal
to
the
civil
courts
by
affidavit
and
legal
process
for
redress
of
the
wrongs
complained
of
and
promised
them
a
faithful
enforcement
of
the
laws
in
pursuance
of
this
action
of
the
governor
the
leaders
resolved
not
to
abide
by
the
agreement
made
with
the
people
in
july
preparations
for
removal
from
the
county
were
stopped
and
their
leaders
engaged
woods
reese
doniphan
and
atchison
to
defend
them
and
prosecute
for
them
in
the
courts
this
aroused
the
citizens
again
and
although
the
mormons
had
not
so
violated
the
law
as
to
enable
the
people
to
proceed
against
them
by
legal
process
the
prospect
from
the
facts
already
stated
were
regarded
by
the
people
as
so
extraordinary
as
to
warrant
extraordinary
measures
their
safety
it
appeared
to
them
depended
upon
the
expulsion
of
the
mormons
from
the
county
by
force
and
they
at
once
began
preparations
to
that
end
on
the
day
of
october
a
party
of
forty
or
fifty
armed
men
without
other
warrant
than
their
own
judgment
of
the
requirements
of
the
situation
visited
a
settlement
of
the
mormons
on
the
big
blue
destroyed
ten
houses
and
whipped
a
number
of
men
on
the
night
of
the
of
november
another
party
visited
a
settlement
about
twelve
miles
southwest
of
independence
where
parley
pratt
had
assembled
a
force
of
about
sixty
men
here
they
encamped
for
the
night
and
put
out
guards
two
of
which
robert
johnson
and
a
man
named
harris
had
an
encounter
with
pratt
whom
one
of
them
knocked
down
with
a
musket
they
were
then
captured
by
pratt
party
and
detained
over
night
the
same
night
they
were
attacked
in
independence
and
houses
were
stoned
doors
broken
down
etc
part
of
gilbert
house
was
pulled
down
and
the
doors
of
the
store
were
broken
in
and
the
goods
scattered
on
the
street
a
party
of
mormons
summoned
from
a
neighboring
settlement
saved
part
of
the
goods
and
attempted
to
have
a
man
named
richard
mccarty
arrested
for
participation
in
the
affair
but
the
justice
of
the
peace
applied
to
samuel
weston
refused
to
issue
a
warrant
for
the
purpose
at
the
same
time
other
mormon
settlements
were
visited
by
the
people
and
great
consternation
was
caused
thereby
among
the
women
and
children
the
men
having
fled
but
no
injury
was
done
them
the
next
day
november
all
the
independence
mormons
numbering
about
thirty
families
left
town
and
gathered
together
for
protection
the
same
day
people
made
another
attack
on
the
big
blue
settlement
when
they
unroofed
another
house
they
attacked
also
another
settlement
about
six
miles
from
independence
the
next
day
november
joshua
lewis
hiram
page
and
two
other
mormons
went
to
lexington
to
ask
protection
from
the
circuit
court
which
was
refused
while
others
applied
to
justice
of
the
peace
silvers
at
independence
with
a
like
result
a
number
of
persons
at
this
time
visited
the
mormons
and
advised
them
to
leave
the
country
as
the
people
were
so
incensed
at
them
that
their
lives
were
in
danger
this
was
sunday
and
the
mormons
had
a
rumor
among
them
that
a
general
massacre
was
impending
for
monday
when
monday
came
the
citizens
collected
and
took
possession
of
a
ferry
belonging
to
the
mormons
across
the
blue
but
they
soon
abandoned
it
and
gathered
in
greater
numbers
at
wilson
store
about
one
mile
west
of
it
a
party
of
mormons
numbering
about
thirty
started
from
an
adjacent
settlement
to
help
those
on
the
blue
but
hearing
of
the
assembly
of
the
citizens
at
the
store
fled
through
the
cornfields
and
were
pursued
by
the
citizens
later
in
the
day
a
party
of
about
thirty
arrived
from
the
settlement
on
the
prairie
where
pratt
had
encountered
the
guards
a
few
nights
before
and
between
them
and
the
citizens
a
fight
occurred
in
which
hugh
brozeal
and
thos
linville
of
the
citizens
were
killed
and
a
mormon
named
barber
fatally
wounded
this
fight
created
the
greatest
excitement
throughout
the
county
the
same
day
richard
mccarty
caused
gilbert
and
whitney
to
be
arrested
for
assaulting
him
in
independence
saturday
night
and
for
causing
his
arrest
and
attempting
to
prosecute
him
afterward
the
situation
of
affairs
now
was
that
no
mormon
could
receive
justice
from
the
public
courts
any
more
than
a
citizen
could
have
received
justice
in
a
trial
by
mormons
the
conduct
of
the
mormons
had
so
disrupted
public
peace
and
order
that
the
county
was
virtually
in
the
hands
of
a
mob
in
this
situation
samuel
owens
clerk
of
the
county
court
advised
gilbert
and
whitney
to
go
to
jail
as
a
means
of
protection
and
they
together
with
mclellin
and
a
coville
and
morley
and
one
other
mormon
took
this
advice
during
the
night
gilbert
coville
and
morley
were
taken
out
for
the
purpose
of
an
interview
with
their
fellow
mormons
but
on
being
returned
next
morning
were
fired
upon
by
a
party
of
six
or
seven
citizens
coville
and
morley
ran
and
escaped
but
gilbert
was
retained
by
the
sheriff
the
balance
of
the
party
were
released
next
day
the
next
day
november
brought
still
more
exciting
times
for
rumors
from
both
sides
exaggerated
the
scenes
that
had
transpired
the
citizens
gathered
to
the
number
of
hundreds
from
all
parts
of
the
county
the
mormons
too
were
rallying
one
hundred
of
them
collecting
about
a
mile
west
of
independence
there
they
halted
waiting
to
learn
the
condition
of
affairs
they
were
informed
that
the
militia
had
been
ordered
out
for
their
protection
and
that
colonel
pitcher
was
in
command
upon
application
to
this
officer
the
mormons
were
told
that
there
was
no
alternative
they
must
leave
the
county
forthwith
and
deliver
into
pitcher
hands
certain
ones
of
their
number
to
be
tried
for
murder
and
to
give
up
their
arms
to
these
demands
the
mormons
yielded
the
arms
about
fifty
guns
of
all
sorts
were
surrendered
the
men
present
accused
of
being
in
the
skirmish
the
evening
before
were
given
up
for
trial
and
after
being
kept
in
durance
for
a
day
and
night
pitcher
took
them
into
a
cornfield
near
by
and
said
to
them
clear
out
following
this
event
small
parties
went
over
the
country
warning
the
mormons
away
wherever
found
and
not
unfrequently
using
violence
to
the
men
when
any
of
them
were
caught
this
was
continued
by
the
infuriated
citizens
until
the
mormons
had
all
fled
the
county
they
attempted
to
find
refuge
in
adjoining
counties
but
clay
was
the
only
one
that
would
receive
them
this
was
the
end
of
mormonism
in
jackson
county
but
not
the
end
of
the
mormon
trouble
for
through
the
influence
of
their
attorneys
and
in
the
absence
of
such
open
violations
of
law
as
would
have
warranted
their
legal
expulsion
from
the
county
they
were
able
to
impress
governor
dunklin
with
the
idea
that
they
were
then
the
victims
of
a
ruffianly
mob
and
were
being
persecuted
on
account
of
their
religion
hence
for
several
years
afterward
there
was
a
sort
of
support
given
them
by
the
governor
which
though
insufficient
to
reinstate
them
in
jackson
county
was
sufficient
to
inspire
them
with
the
hope
and
caused
them
to
expect
and
to
some
extent
propose
to
return
this
kept
up
the
trouble
whether
the
people
were
justified
in
so
employing
violence
to
rid
themselves
of
an
obnoxious
sect
the
members
of
which
had
not
so
violated
the
law
as
to
warrant
their
legal
expulsion
was
shown
by
the
events
of
the
next
few
years
the
mormons
settled
finally
in
clay
carroll
ray
caldwell
and
daviess
counties
where
they
grew
strong
and
prosperous
and
as
in
jackson
county
became
correspondingly
arrogant
and
unbearable
they
took
political
possession
of
daviess
county
and
there
and
in
caldwell
county
began
to
put
in
practice
the
things
the
people
in
jackson
county
had
apprehended
and
to
prevent
which
they
expelled
them
from
the
county
after
making
for
themselves
a
record
for
treason
arson
burglary
theft
murder
and
a
long
list
of
other
crimes
they
were
finally
in
expelled
from
the
state
by
governor
boggs
whom
they
attempted
afterward
on
the
day
of
may
to
assassinate
while
sitting
in
his
house
at
independence

he
felt

he

inquired
of
him
respecting
the
outrageous
acts
of
unparalleled
violence
that
have
lately
happened
in

wished
to
know
whether

were
willing

take

steps
against

the

reasons
why
an

court
of

could
not

our
church
is
scattered
in
every
direction
some
in
van

a

a
part
in
this
county
clay
and
a

in
lafayette
ray
etc
some
of
our
principal
witnesses
would
be
women

children
and
while
the
rage
of
the
mob
continues
it
would
be
impossible
to
gather
them
in

that
your

may
know
of
the
unabating
fury
with
which
the
last
remnant
of
our
people
remaining
in
that
county
are
pursued
at
this
time
i
here
state
that
a
few
families
perhaps
fifteen
to
twenty
who
settled
themselves
more
than
two
years
ago
on
the
prairie
about
fifteen
miles
from
the
county
seat
of
jackson
county
had
hoped
from
the
obscurity
of
their
location
that
they
might
escape
the
vengeance
of
the
enemy
through
the
winter
consequently
they
remained
on
their
plantations
receiving
occasionally
a
few
individual
threats
till
last
sunday
when
a
mob
made
their
appearance
among
them
some
with
pistols
cocked
and
presented
to
their
breasts
commanding
to
leave
the
county
in
three
days
or
they
would
tear
their
houses
down
over
their
heads
etc
an
immediate
court
of
inquiry
called
while
our
people
are
thus
situated
would
give
our
enemies
a
decided
advantage
in
point
of
testimony
while
they
are
in
possession
of
their
homes
and
ours
also
with
no
enemy
in
the
county
to
molest
or
make
them
afraid

forth
the

of

a

families
living

penury
prevented

friendly
manner
avowing
his
desire

enforce
the
civil

if
practicable
to
reinstate
those
unlawfully
dispossessed
of
their

two
clauses
in
this
letter
disclose
something
in
reference
to
the
peculiar
animus
of
the
persecution
waging
against
the
mormon
population
he
wrote
your
case
is
certainly
a
very
emergent
one
and
the
consequences
as
important
to
your
society
as
if
the
war
had
been
waged
against
the
whole
state
yet
the
public
has
no
other
interest
in
it
than
that
the
laws
be
faithfully
executed
thus
far
i
presume
the
whole
community
feel
a
deep
interest
for
that
which
is
the
case
of
the
today
may
be
the
case
of
the
catholics
tomorrow
and
after
them
any
other
sect
that
may
become
obnoxious
to
a
majority
of
the
people
of
any
section
of
the
state
so
far
as
a
faithful
execution
of
the
laws
is
concerned
the
executive
is
disposed
to
do
everything
consistent
with
the
means
furnished
him
by
the
legislature
and
i
think
i
may
safely
say
the
same
of
the
judiciary
as
now
advised
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
a
military
guard
will
be
necessary
to
protect
the
state
witnesses
and
officers
of
the
court
and
to
assist
in
the
execution
of
its
orders
while
sitting

the

the

from

it
was
ascertained

all

for

prosecution
was
at
an
end
wells
had
been
instructed
by
the
governor
to
investigate
as
far
as

jackson
but
the
determined
opposition
presented
to
the
enforcement
of
the
law
by
those
who
had
driven
the
mormons
out
prevented
the
performance
of

duty
the

discharged

atchison

his
company
of

of
others
and
again
our
constitution
says
that
all
men
have
a
natural
and
indefeasible
right
to
worship
almighty
god
according
to
the
dictates
of
their
own
consciences
i
am
fully
persuaded
that
the
eccentricity
of
the
religious
opinions
and
practices
of
the
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
outrages
committed
against
them
they
have
the
right
constitutionally
guaranteed
to
them
and
it
is
indefeasible
to
believe
and
worship
joe
smith
as
a
man
as
an
angel
or
even
as
the
true
and
living
god
and
to
call
their
habitation
zion
the
holy
land
or
even
heaven
itself
indeed
there
is
nothing
so
absurd
or
ridiculous
that
they
have
not
the
right
to
adopt
as
their
religion
so
that
in
its
exercise
they
do
not
interfere
with
the
rights
of
others
i
consider
it
the
duty
of
every
good
citizen
of
jackson
and
adjoining
counties
to
exert
themselves
to
effect
a
compromise
of
their
difficulties
and
were
i
assured
i
would
not
have
to
act
in
my
official
capacity
in
the
affair
i
would
visit
the
parties
in
person
and
exert
myself
to
the
utmost
to
settle
it
my
first
advice
would
be
to
the
mormons
to
sell
out
their
lands
in
jackson
county
and
to
settle
somewhere
else
where
they
could
live
in
peace
if
they
could
get
a
fair
price
for
them
and
reasonable
damages
for
injuries
received
if
this
failed
i
would
try
the
citizens
and
advise
them
to
meet
and
rescind
their
illegal
resolve
of
last
summer
and
agree
to
conform
to
the
laws
in
every
particular
in
respect
to
the
mormons
if
both
these
failed
i
would
then
advise
the
plan
you
have
suggested
for
each
party
to
take
separate
territory
and
confine
their
numbers
within
their
respective
limits
with
the
exception
of
the
public
right
of
ingress
and
egress
upon
the
public
highway
if
all
these
failed
then
the
simple
question
of
legal
right
would
have
to
settle
it
it
is
this
last
that
i
am
afraid
i
shall
have
to
conform
my
action
to
in
the
end
and
hence
the
necessity
of
keeping
myself
in
the
best
situation
to
do
my
duty
impartially
to
facilitate
any
effort
that
might
be
made
to
effect
a
settlement
of
the
troubles
the
governor
appointed
thornton
as
an
aid
to
the
and
requested
him
to
keep
himself
and
the
governor
closely
informed
of
all

was

june
could
not
be
acceded
to
in
the
same
communication
they
gave
the
assurance
that
there
was
no
intention
on
the
part
of
themselves
or
their
brethren
to
invade
the
county
of
jackson
in
a
hostile
manner
by
this
uniting
immediate
conflict
seemed
to
be
averted
and
the
jackson
county
committee
returned
home
by
way
of
the
ferry
where
is
now
the
wayne
city
landing
the
boat
was
taken
over
to
them
and
ten
or
twelve
men
and
as
many
horses
went
aboard
the
boat
when
about
the
middle
of
the
missouri
the
boat
filled
with
water
and
sank
men
horses
and
all
went
down
together
george
bradbury
david
lynch
and
james
campbell
were
drowned
nolan
could
not
swim
but
catching
hold
of
his
horse
tail
was
hauled
safely
to
the
jackson
county
shore
samuel
owens
and
thomas
harrington
clung
to
the
wreck
of
the
boat
and
floated
down
a
mile
and
when
the
boat
reached
a
sandbar
owens
divested
himself
of
all
his
clothes
except
his
shirt
left
the
wreck
and
swam
safely
to
the
shore
he
found
a
cow
path
which
he
followed
to
the
main
road
while
traveling
the
path
he
found
himself
terribly
annoyed
by
the
sting
of
the
nettle
but
he
walked
to
independence
a
distance
of
some
four
miles
harrington
hung
to
the
boat
and
was
drowned
william
everett
swam
to
the
jackson
shore
and
was
washed
against
a
drift
and
was
found
there
ten
days
afterwards
one
hand
fast
hold
of
a
projecting
snag
the
other
men
swam
back
to
the
clay
county
shore
where
they
all
made
it
safe
except
nolan
who
clung
to
a
sawyer
only
a
short
distance
from
the
shore
the
men
who
made
the
shore
built
a
fire
and
encouraged
nolan
to
cling
on
till
they
could
rescue
him
he
did
cling
on
with
the
grip
of
death
when
daylight
came
and
the
men
went
in
to
take
him
off
his
scanty
support
they
found
that
the
water
was
only
waist
deep
and
he
could
have
waded
to
the
shore
with
ease
if
he
had
known
it
it
was
rumored
that
the
mormons
had
secretly
bored
holes
in
the
boat
above
the
customary
water
mark
but
when
loaded
would
sink
to
the
holes
and
then
fill
with
water
but
the
most
reasonable
idea
was
that
the
boat
did
not
generally
carry
such
heavy
loads
hence
the
timbers
had
become
dry
and
the
corking
loose
and
when
the
water
pressed
against
it
gave
way
and
the
boat
filled
joseph
smith
and
his
party
passed
through
richmond
clay
county
june
and
encamped
between
two
branches
of
fishing
river
not
far
from
their
junction
here
they
were
met
by
five
armed
men
who
informed
them
that
sixty
men
from
ray
and
seventy
from
clay
counties
were
to
meet
others
from
different
places
and
prevent
their
further
progress
they
also
learned
that
two
hundred
from
jackson
county
were
to
cross
the
missouri
river
at
williams
ferry
there
to
meet
the
forces
from
ray
and
clay
counties
at
fishing
river
ford
and
thence
to
attack
and
disperse
or
destroy
them
their
designs
if
entertained
were
prevented
for
on
the
night
following
a
severe
storm
of
wind
and
rain
occurred
which
raised
the
streams
flooded
the
country
and
prevented
any
hostile
movements
being
made
by
either
party
smith
band
moved
out
on
the
prairie
on
the
and
encamped
where
on
the
they
were
visited
by
sconce
and
two
other
leading
men
from
ray
county
who
were
anxious
to
know
what
were
their
intentions
smith
replied
stating
that
they
had
come
to
assist
their
brethren
bringing
with
them
clothing
and
other
supplies
to
aid
them
in
being
reinstated
in
their
rights
and
disclaimed
any
design
to
interfere
with
or
molest
any
people
these
men
returned
from
their
visit
satisfied
of
the
intentions
of
smith
and
those
with
him
and
rode
through
the
neighborhood
using
their
influence
to
allay
the
excitement
cornelius
gillium
sheriff
of
clay
county
went
to
the
camp
of
smith
and
party
on
june
and
asked
for
smith
and
upon
being
presented
to
him
gave
them
some
instructions
concerning
the
peculiarities
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
county
and
advised
smith
and
the
rest
as
to
the
course
that
should
be
pursued
by
them
to
secure
the
protection
of
the
people
smith
and
those
with
him
resumed
their
march
to
reach
liberty
clay
county
on
the
but
were
met
by
atchison
and
others
when
within
six
miles
of
the
town
and
were
by
them
persuaded
not
to
go
to
liberty
as
the
people
were
too
much
incensed
against
them
the
party
therefore
turned
away
to
the
left
and
encamped
upon
the
premises
of
a
member
of
the
fraternity
named
burghardt
on
the
bank
of
rush
creek
from
here
a
proposition
for
settlement
was
agreed
to
on
the
part
of
the
mormons
and
was
by
them
sent
to
owens
and
others
the
committee
from
jackson
county
this
proposition
was
in
substance
as
follows
that
if
the
inhabitants
of
jackson
county
would
not
permit
them
to
return
to
their
homes
and
remain
in
peace
then
twelve
disinterested
men
were
to
be
chosen
six
by
each
party
to
the
strife
and
these
twelve
men
were
to
fix
the
value
of
the
lands
of
those
men
resident
in
the
county
who
were
opposed
to
the
mormons
and
could
not
consent
to
live
in
the
county
with
them
that
when
this
valuation
was
made
the
mormons
were
to
have
one
year
in
which
to
raise
the
money
that
none
of
the
mormons
should
enter
the
county
to
reside
until
the
money
was
paid
that
the
same
twelve
men
were
also
to
fix
the
amount
of
damages
incurred
by
the
mormons
in
their
expulsion
and
the
amount
of
damages
so
fixed
should
be
taken
from
the
aggregate
sum
to
be
paid
by
the
said
mormons
for
the
lands
appraised
by
said
arbitrators
on

company
to
be
broken
into
small
bands

scattered
them
among
the
resident
members
he
also
apprised
generals
doniphan
atchison
and
thornton
of
what
he
had
done
informing
them
that
his
company
of
emigrants
would
so
remain
dispersed
until
every
effort
for
an
adjustment
of
differences
had
been
made
on
their
part
that
would
in
anywise
be
required
of
them
by
disinterested
men
of
republican
principles

secure
peaceably
their
homes

for
the
performance
of
this
agreement
we
do
not
wish
to
settle
down
in
a
body
except
where
we
can
purchase
the
land

money
for
to
take
possession
by
conquest

the
shedding
of
blood
is
entirely
foreign
to
our
feelings
the
shedding
of

we
shall
not
be
guilty
of
until
all
just

honorable
means

james
long
and
james
collins
the
mormons
also
appointed
a
committee
of
their
number
who
drafted
an
appeal
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
in
which
they
set
forth
the
purposes
expressed
by
them
in
their
statement
to
gillium
this
appeal
was
published
and
scattered
abroad
but
it
is
not
known
what
effect
it
had
other
than
possibly
to
exasperate
the
feeling
in
missouri
against
them
the
message
of
the
governor
of
missouri
to
the
general
assembly
of
the
state
then
in
session
communicated
on
november
recommended
a
commission
of
both
houses
of
the
legislature
to
inquire
into
the
mormon
difficulties
the
house
in
committee
of
the
whole
on
the
state
of
the
republic
november
appointed
a
select
committee
of
seven
to
with
such
number
from
the
senate
as
that
body
might
appoint
to
inquire
into
the
causes
of
said
disturbances
and
the
conduct
of
the
military
operations
in
suppressing
them
with
power
to
send
for
men
and
papers
the
senate
on
november
appointed
turner
noland
and
scott
as
their
part
of
said
committee
thus
concurring
in
the
action
this
committee
reported
in
the
senate
on
december
that
they
had
taken
the
matters
submitted
to
them
into
consideration
and
decided
that
they
thought
it
unwise
and
injudicious
under
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
to
predicate
a
report
from
the
papers
documents
purporting
to
be
copies
of
the
evidence
taken
before
an
examining
court
held
in
richmond
ray
county
for
the
purpose
of
inquiring
into
the
charges
alleged
against
the
people
called
growing
out
of
the
difficulties
between
that
people
and
other
citizens
of
the
state
the
reasons
given
are
the
evidence
given
in
that
examination
was
in
a
great
degree
parte
and
not
of
a
character
to
afford
a
fair
and
impartial
investigation
the
papers
had
been
so
certified
as
to
satisfy
the
committee
of
their
authenticity
there
were
still
charges
pending
against
some
of
the
mormons
for
treason
murder
and
other
felonies
which
charges
were
to
be
tried
before
the
courts
in
the
several
counties
where
such
crimes
were
charged
to
have
been
committed
publication
of
the
evidence
and
papers
referred
to
might
affect
seriously
the
right
of
trial
by
a
jury
of
the
vicinage
by
prejudicing
public
sentiment
against
the
accused
were
the
committee
to
act
and
send
for
papers
and
persons
it
might
interfere
with
the
action
of
the
courts
wherein
the
suits
were
pending
for
this
reason
the
committee
recommended
the
appointment
of
a
committee
who
should
after
the
adjournment
of
the
assembly
go
into
the
vicinity
of
the
scenes
of
the
difficulties
there
to
make
inquiry
and
make
proper
report
to
the
legislature
of
their
inquiry
and
examination
when
concluded
among
other
reasons
given
for
such
recommendation
occur
these
that
the
documents
although
serviceable
in
giving
direction
to
the
course
of
inquiry
are
none
of
them
except
the
official
orders
and
correspondence
such
as
ought
to
be
received
as
conclusive
evidence
of
the
facts
stated
and
that
it
would
not
be
proper
to
publish
the
official
orders
and
correspondence
between
the
officers
in
command
and
the
executive
without
the
evidence
on
which
they
were
founded
and
that
evidence
is
not
sufficiently
full
and
satisfactory
to
authorize
its
publication
the
recommendations
of
the
committee
were
concurred
in
by
the
senate
january
and
on
the
turner
introduced
a
bill
providing
such
inquiry
making
it
the
duty
of
the
commission
when
appointed
to
inquire
into
the
causes
of
the
disturbances
this
bill
passed
after
amendment
and
being
reported
to
the
house
was
on
february
laid
on
the
table
until
july
by
to
pending
the
expiration
of
the
time
for
which
this
bill
to
inquire
into
the
causes
of
the
disturbance
of
the
peace
in
the
various
counties
of
clay
ray
and
daviess
the
history
of
the
mormons
of
the
state
is
about
as
follows
after
the
removal
from
jackson
and
the
acceptance
of
the
final
decision
nothing
further
appears
of
any
settlement
being
attempted
in
jackson
county
by
the
expelled
party
or
their
brethren
joseph
smith
returned
to
kirtland
ohio
with
many
others
while
some
concluded
to
remain
in
the
to
them
land
of
zion
and
these
settled
in
and
through
the
counties
above
named
things
did
not
long
remain
in
a
peaceful
condition
however
and
it
became
apparent
that
there
would
again
be
trouble
to
avoid
this
if
possible
it
appears
that
some
of
the
leading
men
among
the
mormons
were
sent
to
richmond
ray
county
and
made
inquiry
as
to
whether
the
citizens
would
be
willing
that
they
should
settle
upon
the
territory
north
of
and
contiguous
to
the
county
of
ray
at
that
time
unorganized
to
this
no
answer
was
given
and
taking
it
for
granted
that
no
objections
would
be
offered
many
removed
and
james
hunt
in
his
mormon
war
written
in
declares
that
here
for
some
time
the
prophet
concentrated
his
followers
houses
were
erected
as
if
by
magic
improvements
were
prosecuted
with
such
rapidity
as
to
promise
a
flourishing
town
and
country
in
a
very
short
time
the
country
round
about
was
fast
being
settled
and
undergoing
improvements
every
month
bringing
swarms
of
deluded
fanatics
to
forward
the
designs
of
their
ambitious
leaders
settlements
were
made
at
far
west
one
on
grand
river
in
daviess
called
and
one
in
carrol
county
called
dewitt
at
these
places
says
hunt
members
gathered
improving
town
and
country
rapidly
it
is
due
the
further
says
this
writer
here
to
state
that
they
were
an
industrious
agricultural
people
or
at
least
that
portion
of
them
who
located
in
the
country
round
about
in
the
as
these
settlements
were
called
by
them
between
the
year
and
the
beginning
of
these
settlements
outside
of
jackson
continued
to
thrive
disturbed
possibly
by
now
and
then
an
outrage
or
reprisal
such
as
may
occur
in
newly
settled
countries
among
any
class
of
settlers
for
which
mutual
wrongs
attempted
redresses
were
sought
before
mutual
courts
as
some
of
the
local
minor
courts
were
in
the
hands
of
the
mormons
though
the
county
and
superior
ones
were
held
by
other
citizens
and
each
party
claimed
that
injustice
was
done
them
by
these
courts
by
reason
of
partisan
bias
the
feeling
was
growing
bitter
against
the
mormons
on
the
part
of
the
citizens
and
the
feelings
of
injury
and
resentment
began
to
crystallize
into
provocation
and
resentment
especially
so
with
some
individuals
on
the
part
of
the
mormons
joseph
smith
and
sidney
rigdon
had
settled
with
their
families
in
the
state
and
under
their
direction
the
people
had
been
organized
and
armed
more
or
less
efficiently
to
repel
encroachments
and
protect
themselves
as
they
stated
from
unlawful
aggressions
they
had
been
told
that
the
authority
of
the
legislature
and
executive
could
not
be
brought
to
bear
for
their
defense
until
remedies
at
the
lesser
courts
failed
them
and
then
only
at
the
requisition
of
local
civil
officers
and
had
been
advised
whether
judiciously
or
otherwise
to
defend
themselves
there
grew
up
some
dissensions
among
themselves
a
few
some
of
the
prominent
men
among
them
dissented
from
the
rules
of
the
society
and
the
authority
of
smith
and
rigdon
these
were
denounced
as
apostates
and
attempts
made
to
drive
them
out
from
the
society
and
settlements
which
resulted
in
mutual
recrimination
and
the
making
public
exaggerated
accounts
of
the
intentions
of
the
mormon
leaders
some
of
the
brethren
who
were
fanatical
or
more
unwise
than
others
were
guilty
of
a
flagrant
excess
of
language
calculated
to
create
suspicion
and
uneasiness
in
the
minds
of
those
already
prejudiced
against
them
as
a
people
there
were
some
among
them
who
committed
crimes
and
were
not
punished
all
of
which
hastened
the
impending
trouble
these
things
among
themselves
and
the
constant
manifestation
of
hostility
from
many
of
the
citizens
lawless
and
irresponsible
and
some
of
note
and
ability
among
the
most
respectable
as
well
with
occasional
depredation
upon
the
mormons
resulted
in
making
further
peace
very
improbable
in
june
sidney
rigdon
preached
a
sermon
taking
strong
ground
against
the
dissenters
and
the
missourians
this
sermon
was
construed
as
a
declaration
of
war
against
the
apostates
and
of
reprisal
against
the
citizens
hunt
states
that
in
this
state
of
things
the
citizens
apprehended
against
them
but
having
to
go
before
a
mormon
justice
and
jury
they
failed
and
were
abused
by
the
mormons
for
bringing
vexatious
suits
and
that
the
gentiles
were
not
idle
in
setting
afloat
their
grievances
and
probably
exaggerating
them
rigdon
is
said
to
have
delivered
an
oration
july
at
far
west
before
a
gathered
multitude
which
was
called
a
treasonable
speech
this
oration
we
have
carefully
read
and
can
now
see
that
the
passages
construed
as
treasonable
and
dangerous
may
have
been
but
the
indignant
protest
against
violence
that
a
possible
enthusiast
might
unadvisedly
use
they
are
as
follows
and
that
mob
that
comes
on
us
to
disturb
us
it
shall
be
between
us
and
them
a
war
of
extermination
for
we
will
follow
them
till
the
last
drop
of
their
blood
is
spilled
or
they
will
have
to
exterminate
us
for
we
will
carry
the
seat
of
war
to
their
own
houses
and
their
own
families
and
one
party
or
the
other
shall
be
utterly
destroyed
remember
it
then
all
men
we
will
never
be
the
aggressors
we
will
infringe
on
the
rights
of
no
people
but
shall
stand
for
our
own
till
death
we
claim
our
own
rights
and
are
willing
that
others
shall
enjoy
theirs
no
man
shall
be
at
liberty
to
come
into
our
streets
to
threaten
us
with
mobs
for
if
he
does
he
shall
atone
for
it
before
he
leaves
the
place
neither
shall
he
vilify
or
slander
any
of
us
for
suffer
it
we
will
not
in
this
place
neither
will
we
indulge
any
man
or
set
of
men
in
instituting
vexatious
against
us
to
cheat
us
out
of
our
rights
if
they
attempt
it
we
say
woe
be
unto
them
august
at
an
election
in
daviess
county
a
quarrel
ensued
between
some
citizens
and
mormons
one
of
the
latter
was
badly
stabbed
and
others
on
both
sides
wounded
from
this
occurrence
rumors
flew
in
every
direction
the
mormons
at
far
west
were
told
that
several
of
their
number
had
been
killed
and
two
hundred
of
them
went
into
daviess
county
to
inquire
into
it
they
found
no
one
killed
but
adam
black
a
justice
of
the
peace
of
daviess
county
stated
under
oath
before
john
wright
and
elijah
foley
fellow
justices
that
smith
and
others
to
the
number
of
one
hundred
and
exacted
from
him
about
august
a
written
promise
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
state
and
the
united
states
and
not
to
support
a
mob
nor
attach
himself
to
any
mob
nor
to
molest
the
mormons
to
answer
to
this
charge
smith
wight
and
others
were
arrested
and
recognized
to
appear
for
trial
other
disturbances
followed
and
upon
representation
of
a
deputation
of
citizens
from
daviess
county
atchison
at
the
head
of
a
thousand
men
of
the
third
division
of
militia
went
to
the
scene
of
trouble
the
found
the
citizens
and
the
mormons
in
hostile
array
he
dispersed
both
parties
and
reported
to
the
governor
with
the
further
statement
that
no
further
depredations
were
to
be
feared
from
the
mormons
almost
simultaneously
disturbances
occurred
in
carroll
and
caldwell
counties
the
citizens
determined
to
drive
the
mormons
from
the
state
the
mormons
refused
to
be
driven
a
number
of
citizens
made
representations
to
general
atchison
on
september
that
the
citizens
of
daviess
had
a
mormon
in
custody
as
a
prisoner
and
that
the
mormons
had
john
comer
wm
mchamy
and
allen
miller
prisoners
as
hostages
certain
of
the
mormons
and
other
citizens
of
carroll
county
petitioned
the
governor
from
de
witt
stating
the
committal
of
lawless
acts
against
them
among
which
was
the
ordering
them
to
leave
the
county
giving
them
till
october
and
asking
interference
and
relief
this
was
dated
september
from
reports
filed
with
the
governor
by
generals
parks
david
atchison
and
doniphan
copies
of
which
accompanied
the
messages
of
the
governor
to
the
assembly
it
appears
that
when
the
proper
authorities
appeared
on
the
scene
of
difficulty
the
mormons
gave
up
not
only
the
prisoners
they
had
taken
in
reprisal
but
their
arms
and
also
the
men
of
their
number
against
whom
civil
proceedings
were
pending
general
parks
in
a
report
dated
mill
post
september
states
whatever
may
have
been
the
disposition
of
the
people
called
before
our
arrival
here
since
we
have
made
our
appearance
they
have
shown
no
disposition
to
resist
the
laws
or
of
hostile
intention
there
has
been
so
much
prejudice
and
exaggeration
concerning
this
matter
that
i
find
things
on
my
arrival
here
totally
different
from
what
i
was
prepared
to
expect
when
we
arrived
here
we
found
a
large
body
of
men
from
the
counties
adjoining
armed
and
in
the
field
for
the
purpose
as
i
learned
of
assisting
the
people
of
this
county
against
the
without
being
called
out
by
the
proper
authorities
general
atchison
wrote
the
governor
from
liberty
missouri
september
i
have
no
doubt
your
excellency
has
been
deceived
by
the
exaggerated
statements
of
designing
or
half
crazy
men
i
have
found
there
is
no
cause
of
alarm
on
account
of
the
they
are
not
to
be
feared
they
are
much
alarmed
hostile
feeling
culminated
rapidly
the
citizens
in
absence
of
the
militia
gathered
their
forces
together
and
on
the
night
of
october
attacked
de
witt
a
committee
of
citizens
of
chariton
county
went
into
carroll
county
and
found
de
witt
invested
by
a
large
force
the
mormons
in
defense
and
suing
for
peace
and
wishing
for
the
interposition
of
the
civil
authorities
they
reported
october
general
atchison
reported
october
that
the
mormons
had
sold
out
in
carroll
county
and
left
and
that
a
portion
of
their
assailants
were
on
the
march
to
daviess
county
with
one
piece
of
artillery
where
it
is
thought
the
same
lawless
game
is
to
be
played
over
and
the
driven
from
that
county
and
probably
from
caldwell
nothing
in
my
opinion
wrote
this
general
in
his
report
but
the
strongest
measures
within
the
power
of
the
executive
will
put
down
this
spirit
of
mobocracy
the
mormons
resisted
and
in
their
turn
plundered
the
store
of
jacob
stollings
at
gallatin
removing
the
goods
burned
the
store
and
other
buildings
in
that
place
and
millport
the
citizens
of
ray
daviess
carroll
jackson
howard
and
some
other
counties
gathered
and
apprising
the
governor
that
the
mormons
now
growing
desperate
had
become
the
aggressors
the
governor
boggs
moved
thereto
by
representations
made
to
him
issued
orders
to
general
john
clark
placing
him
in
command
of
all
the
force
necessary
with
instruction
that
he
was
in
receipt
of
information
of
the
most
appalling
nature
which
entirely
changed
the
face
of
things
and
places
the
in
the
attitude
of
an
open
and
armed
defiance
of
the
laws
and
of
having
made
war
upon
the
people
of
this
state
the
must
be
treated
as
enemies
and
must
be
exterminated
or
driven
from
the
state
if
necessary
for
the
public
peace
their
outrages
are
beyond
all
description
in
obedience
to
this
order
general
clark
associated
with
general
lucas
proceeded
to
the
seat
of
war
and
without
much
resistance
disbanded
the
armed
forces
of
the
mormons
demanded
and
received
their
arms
took

of
the
fifth

circuit
in
the
state
of
missouri
at
richmond
beginning
november
at
this

some

were
recognized
for

and
gave
bonds
a
further
demand
was
made
to
the
effect
that
the
mormons
make
an
appropriation
to
pay
their

the
indemnification
for
the
damage
to
citizens
done
by
them
the
property
said
to
have
been
taken
by
them
was
mostly
restored
upon
demand
of
the
officers
the
mormons
began
leaving
at
once
and
continued
to
leave
until
all
were
gone
except
now
and
then
a
recalcitrant
member
or
one
who
had
some
personal
friends
among
the
citizens
many
sold
out
for
what
they
could
get
and
many
were
compelled
to
go
without
selling
at
all
their
leaders
were
taken
prisoners
their
means
of
defense
as
well
as
offense
were
taken
from
them
by
law
and
by
the
will
of
the
citizens
enforced
by
the
order
of
the
governor
some
twelve
thousand
people
were
driven
from
the
state
the
number
of
killed
in
this
mormon
war
is
stated
by
the
official
report
of
the
general
in
command
in
the
following
language
the
whole
number
of
the
killed
through
the
whole
difficulty
as
far
as
i
can
ascertain
are
about
forty
and
several
wounded
this
is
rather
a
damaging
result
against
the
state
after
the
terrible
character
given
the
mormons
by
those
opposed
to
them
and
upon
whose
reports
the
governor
ordered
their
suppression

their

states
that
the

afterwards
reached

such
in
brief
is
the
history
of
that
strange
people

succeeding
their

from
the

over
as
not
properly
belonging
in

after
this
expulsion
from

the
mormons
settled
in
illinois
where
in
six
years
from
to
they
increased
rapidly
and
laid
the
foundation
for
a
magnificent
city

began
the
erection
of
a

in

calling
themselves
saints
they
are
in
fact
a

church
joseph

the

where
they
have
a
printing
house
containing
engine
press

and
other

for
carrying

quite
an
extensive
business
they
number
some
fifteen

which
they
by
the
engagement
and
aid
of
the
citizens
have
built
one
of
these
buildings
is
in
independence
this
church
under
smith
presidency
has
kept
an
active
ministry
at
work
in
utah
endeavoring
to
disabuse
the
mormons
of
that
territory
of
the
dogma
of
polygamy
which
they
assert
to
be
no
part
of
primitive
mormonism
and
from
the
history
of
the
sect
during
its
stay
in
missouri
from
to
it
would
appear
that
these
organizers
are
correct
for
not
a
single
charge
of
such
dogma
being
held
or
taught
appears
in
the
many
statements
made
against
them
or
in
the
published
orders
and
reports
of
the
officers
engaged
in
expelling
them
from
the
state
they
at
all
events
oppose
the
tenet

are

under
their
prophet
joe

came
into
jackson
county
where
the
previous
year
large
tracts
of
land
had
been
entered
and
purchased
for
their
benefit
and
began
to
occupy
and
possess
the
land
with
the
intention
as
they
said
of
remaining
for
all
time
but
their
years
in
that
land
were
few
and
full
of
trouble
they
were
in
constant
collision
with
their
gentile
neighbors
who
frequently
tied
them
up
and
whipped
them
with
cowhides
and
hickory
switches
derided
their

them

they
did
not
openly
persecute

threw
their

finally
drove

many
of
the
mormons
took
refuge
in
clay

every
vacant
cabin
in
the
south
of
the

was
occupied
by

fugitives
many
of

the
residents
of
the
county
of
an
old
citizen
of
independence
has
recently
published
in
the
kansas
city
an
interesting
article
on
the
mormon
troubles
in
jackson
county
one
paragraph
of
this
article
reads
as
follows
true
history
however
must
record
the
fact
that
the
deluded
followers
of
the
prophet
joseph
smith
in
their
first
effort
to
organize
and
establish
a
religious
socialistic
community
in
jackson
county
missouri
were
unjustly
and
outrageously
treated
by
the
original
settlers
that
is
seen
in
the
tragical
and
pitiful
scene
which
occurred
during
the
last
part
of
their
sojourn
in
this
their
promised
inheritance
their
zion
and
new
jerusalem
with
scarcely
one
exception
the
old
settlers
were
the
aggressors
so
far
as
overt
acts
of
hostility
were
concerned
during
the
last
year
of
their
stay
the
continued
persecutions
to
which
they
were
subjected
excited
the
sympathy
of
many
outside
the
county
especially
of
the
people
of
clay
county
who
gave
them
an
asylum
and
assistance
for
a
year
or
two
after
their
expulsion
indeed
material
aid
and
arms
were
furnished
them
by
citizens
of
clay
county
before
their
expulsion
a
wagon
with
a
quantity
of
guns
was
stopped
near
the
south
part
of
kansas
city
and
seized
by
parties
on
the
watch
the
jackson
county
people
were
indignant
at
the
reception
given
the
mormons
by
the
citizens
of
clay
county
and
stigmatized
some
of
our
citizens
as
jack
mormons
a
term
yet
used
on
one
occasion
a
delegation
of
eleven
jackson
county
citizens
led
by
major
owens
and
james
campbell
came
over
to
liberty
to
hold
a
council
with
the
gentile
citizens
and
mormons
of
clay
county
in
regard
to
the
lands
from
which
the
mormons
had
been
driven
the
title
to
these
lands
was
in
the
hands
of
the
mormons
but
the
gentiles
wished
to
extinguish
it
by
purchase
if
it
could
be
obtained
at
their
the
gentiles
price
accordingly
they
offered
the
mormons
an
insignificant
sum
for
their
lands
and
farms
many
of
which
were
already
in
possession
of
certain
citizens
of
jackson
county
but
this
offer
was
refused
the
clay
county
people
generally
endorsed
the
refusal
returning
home
that
night
in
great
ill
humor
with
their
neighbors
on
this
side
of
the
river
the
delegation
of
jackson
county
met
with
a
sad
misfortune
as
they
were
crossing
the
river
at
duckins
ferry
about
the
middle
of
the
river
the
boat
sank
and
five
of
them
were
drowned
three
of
the
unfortunate
men
were
ilu
job
james
campbell
and
everett
the
casualty
increased
the
indignation
already
felt
against
the
people
of
clay
county
by
the
year
all
or
nearly
all
of
the
mormons
had
left
clay
county
and
joined
the
mormon
settlement
at
or
near
far
west
or
at
other
points
in
caldwell
and
daviess
counties
and
in
october
of
that
year
the
war
broke
out
among
the
troops

and
did
not
leave
with
it
the
detachment
marched
across
into
ray
county
and
fell
in
with
the
jackson
county
regiment
which
had
refused
to
march
through
clay
county
owing
to
the
animosity
existing
and
had
crossed
the
river
at
lexington
all
the
clay
county
men
were
in
line
confronting
the
breastworks
when
the
mormon
camp
at

west
was
surrendered
and
witnessed
all
the
proceedings
they
saw
the

pass
back

out
with

lion
at

head
and
form
a

unbuckle
his

detach
his
pistols
from
their
holsters
and
pass
them
over
to
his

quietly
remarked

them
to
my
adjutant
then
they
saw
hinkle
dash
the
tears
from
his
face
and
ride
back
to
his
soldiers
the
mormons
agreed
fully
to
doniphan
conditions
that
they
should
deliver
up
their
arms
surrender
their
prominent

the
mormons
of
daviess
county
by
this
sect
of
professed
christians
whose
history
is
but
a
burlesque
upon
the
pure
morality
of
the
meek
and
lowly
but
glorious
nazarene
came
to
this
country
in
their
chief
settlement
was
in
far
west
in
caldwell
county
where
their
apostle
joseph
smith
and
all
their
chief
dignitaries
resided
here
in
the
corner
stone
of
the
temple
was
laid
with
great
ceremony
and
not
a
little
deception
for
smith
had
foretold
that
the
rock
which
was
of
great
size
would
move
at
his
command
this
it
apparently
did
do
but
actually
by
means
of
ropes
and
pulleys
worked
through
a
concealed
trench
by
men
at
a
distance
the
temple
was
to
occupy
a
large
square
in
the
centre
of
the
town
and
was
approached
by
four
main
streets
each
one
hundred
feet
wide
and
was
to
exceed
in
magnificence
any
edifice
in
the
united
states
the
temple
was
never
built
but
far
west
attained
a
population
of
three
thousand
inhabitants
and
was
for
some
years
the
county
seat
of
caldwell
county
now
however
not
one
stone
is
left
upon
another
and
the
farmer
plow
turns
up
their
once
busy
streets
and
desecrates
their
holy
ground
in
our
own
county
their
chief
point
was
a
place
still
known
as
diamond
but
by
the
mormons
called
which
we
believe
means
the
grave
of
adam
this
place
is
the
old
farm
now
owned
and
occupied
by
major
mcdonald
and
lies
about
three
and
a
half
miles
northwest
of
gallatin
it
is
a
romantic
spot
on
the
east
bluff
overlooking
the
valley
of
grand
river
and
to
this
day
owing
perhaps
to
fissures
in
the
underlying
rock
the
observer
may
behold
the
greasy
walks
of
their
garden
of
eden
laid
off
with
almost
mathematical
precision
adam
grave
is
at
the
edge
of
the
garden
and
is
a
small
mound
of
broken
limestone
gravel
and
soil
intermixed
from
diamond
to
far
west
the
mormons
had
a
very
fair
road
and
all
along
it
and
interspersed
throughout
the
county
were
many
settlers
of
their
faith
a
trace
of
wandering
a
track
of
blood
and
temple
building
are
the
principal
features
in
the
history
of
this
deluded
people
deluded
by
a
film
so
thin
that
even
sense
might
see
beyond
taking
their
rise
in
the
south
of
new
york
they
soon
migrated
to
kirtland
ohio
then
to
jackson
county
missouri
then
to
clay
county
then
to
daviess
and
caldwell
then
to
nauvoo
illinois
and
thence
across
the
plains
to
salt
lake
and
even
now
there
are
rumors
of
another
removal
in
all
these
places
they
began
to
build
a
temple
and
in
all
except
the
first
they
left
the
marks
of
blood
either
their
own
or
shed
by
them
the
mormons
have
always
claimed
that
they
were
peaceable
and
yes
peaceable
when
not
resisted
in
their
outrages
when
obeying
the
laws
of
their
prophet
they
have
always
claimed
that
they
never
shed
blood
only
when
attacked
but
this
is
stark
falsehood
as
witness
the
work
of
their
danite
destroying
angels
mountain
meadow
massacre
and
even
the
attacks
they
complain
of
were
always
induced
by
their
infamous
conduct
the
first
cardinal
principle
in
the
tenets
of
their
religion
as
exemplified
among
our
people
was
the
lord
has
given
the
earth
and
the
fullness
thereof
to
his
saints
the
next
was
we
are
his
saints
thus
armed
and
equipped
and
incited
by
their
leaders
they
roamed
through
the
county
took
whatever
pleased
their
fancy
carried
it
to
diamond
and
placed
it
in
the
lord
storehouse
nothing
was
safe
nothing
was
exempt
from
their
rapacity
and
our
sturdy
pioneers
were
justly
indignant
and
panting
for
revenge
with
them
the
mormon
war
meant
business
and
we
find
the
county
court
on
the

furnished
the

during

mormon

so
great
was
the
numerical
superiority
of
the
mormons
that
the
citizens
dared
offer
no
resistance
but
were
simply
at
their
mercy
on
the
of
october
the
mormon
legion
formed
their
line
of
battle
in
front
of
the
few
houses
in
gallatin
and
ordered
the

to
leave
at
once
from
there
the

proceeded
to

issued
the

night
the

they
did

money

they
took
what
they

on

appropriated

shortly
prior

the
mormons
driven
from

sent
whitmer
and
others
to
select
a
home
in
the

far

was
chosen
which
was
approved
by
the

the

chosen
for

was
a

the

approached
by

wide
as
its

increased
additions
to

were
laid
out
at
the
time
of

the
population
of

was
about
two
thousand

hundred
and
it
was
the
largest
town
in
the
state
north
of
the
missouri
mormon
the
mormons
as
a
people
were
honest
sober
and
industrious
but
the
object
of
the
leaders
was
to
make
money
and
obtain
power
joe
smith
and
his
brother
hyrum
with
the
church
funds
purchased
of
the
government
large
tracts
of
land
around
far
west
which
they
did
not
scruple
to
sell
to
their
followers
at
exorbitant
prices
when
the
leaders
set
the
example
of
speculating
in
the
devotion
of
the
people
it
is
scarcely
to
be
wondered
at
if
the
subordinates
went
to
greater
extremes
to
fill
their
purses
and
if
they
had
but
little
respect
for
their
obligations
to
each
other
they
had
less
for
the
laws
of
the
state
or
the
rights
of
their
gentile
neighbors
some
of
their
daring
leaders
taught
the
doctrine
that
the
lord
had
given
the
earth
and
the
fullness
thereof
as
an
inheritance
to
his
people
and
they
were
his
people
and
had
a
right
at
pleasure
to
take
what
pleased
their
appetite
or
fancy
at
the
time
of
the
difficulties
in
jackson
county
joe
smith
organized
a
band
of
men
called
the
army
of
zion
to
protect
his
people
against
the
attacks
of
their
enemies
among
these
were
many
who
were
too
lazy
to
earn
a
living
by
the
sweat
of
their
brow
desperado
and
vagabond
joined
his
band
for
the
purpose
of
plundering
squads
of
them
strolled
about
the
county
threatening
the
men
intimidating
the
women
and
appropriating
in
the
name
of
the
prophet
any
property
which
pleased
their
taste
as
the
mormons
largely
outnumbered
the
gentiles
they
elected
to
all
offices
of
honor
and
trust
persons
of
their
own
faith
smith
was
careful
that
the
persons
selected
should
be
subservient
to
the
will
of
himself
and
his
apostles
the
gentiles
declared
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
get
a
fair
hearing
before
the
mormon
magistrates
and
juries
that
the
trials
were
farces
that
the
leaders
taught
and
the
members
acted
on
the
principle
that
a
gentile
had
no
rights
that
a
mormon
was
bound
to
respect
and
that
not
the
merits
of
the
cause
but
the
creeds
of
the
contestants
determined
which
way
the
scales
should
turn
whether
these
complaints
were
true
or
false
they
were
believed
by
many
and
naturally
excited
deep
indignation
against
the
mormons
tales
of
debauchery
theft
and
murder
were
told
of
them
and
their
expulsion
from
the
county
demanded
these
bitter
feelings
engendered
broils
and
riots
crowds
of
excited
fanatics
pelted
obnoxious
gentiles
on
the
streets
of
far
west
with
clubs
and
stones
in
retaliation
armed
gentiles
rode
into
public
meetings
where
their
lawless
conduct
was
being
denounced
seized
the
speakers
and
applied
the
lash
until
the
blood
trickled
down
their
backs
both
sides
ceased
to
resort
to
legal
methods
in
the
enforcement
of
their
rights
amid
so
much
excitement
and
insubordination
the
civil
authorities
were
powerless
to
enforce
the
laws
and
punish
offenses
finally
in
the
disorder
became
so
great
and
outrages
so
frequent
that
the
state
authorities
felt
it
their
duty
to
interfere
governor

issued
a

one

being
savagely

his

were
so

place
in

the
days
were
cold
and
bleak
but
the
clamor
for
the
instant

was
so
great
that
the

without

anything
that
would

to
walk
before
half
their
journey
was
accomplished
the
chilly
blasts
of
winter
howled
about
them

added
to

thousand
to
less

the
deserted

offered
inducements
to

from

continued
in
an
uncertain
condition

the
of
october
when
a
deadly
conflict
occurred

which
two
gentiles
and
one
mormon
were
killed

increased

became

summer
of

of

a
good

from

to
forward

upon

being
ascertained

these

called

of

prominent

of

however
was
done
at

meeting
but
at

subsequent
meeting
which
was
held
a
few
days
afterward
a
committee
of
citizens
was
appointed
to
notify

of
the
mormon
leaders
at
de
witt
what
they
intended
to
do
colonel
hinkle
upon
being
notified
by

committee
became
indignant
and
threatened
extermination
to
all
who
should
attempt
to
molest
him
or
the
saints
in
anticipation
of
trouble
and
believing
that
the
gentiles
would
attempt
to
force
them
from

mormon
recruits
flocked
to
the
town
from
every
direction
and
pitched
their
tents
in
and
around
the
town
in
great
numbers
the
gentiles
nothing
daunted
planned
an
attack
upon
this
encampment
to
take
place
on
the
of
september
and
accordingly
one
hundred
and
fifty
men
bivouacked
near
the
town
on
that
day
a
conflict
ensued
but
nothing
serious
occurred
the
mormons
evacuated
their
works
and
fled
to
some
log
houses
where
they
could

more
successfully
resist

had
in

returned

agreed
to
the
proposition
in

therewith
the
mormons
without
further
delay
loaded
up
their
wagons
for
the

in
caldwell

whether
the
terms
of
the
agreement
were
ever
carried
out
on
the
part
of

it
is
not
known
the

had
doubtless
suffered
much

in

the
