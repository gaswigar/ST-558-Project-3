a
child
s
dream
of
a
star
there
was
once
a
child
and
he
strolled
about
a
good
deal
and
thought
of
a
number
of
things
he
had
a
sister
who
was
a
child
too
and
his
constant
companion
these
two
used
to
wonder
all
day
long
they
wondered
at
the
beauty
of
the
flowers
they
wondered
at
the
height
and
blueness
of
the
sky
they
wondered
at
the
depth
of
the
bright
water
they
wondered
at
the
goodness
and
the
power
of
god
who
made
the
lovely
world
they
used
to
say
to
one
another
sometimes
supposing
all
the
children
upon
earth
were
to
die
would
the
flowers
and
the
water
and
the
sky
be
sorry
they
believed
they
would
be
sorry
for
said
they
the
buds
are
the
children
of
the
flowers
and
the
little
playful
streams
that
gambol
down
the
hillsides
are
the
children
of
the
water
and
the
smallest
bright
specks
playing
at
in
the
sky
all
night
must
surely
be
the
children
of
the
stars
and
they
would
all
be
grieved
to
see
their
playmates
the
children
of
men
no
more
there
was
one
clear
shining
star
that
used
to
come
out
in
the
sky
before
the
rest
near
the
above
the
graves
it
was
larger
and
more
beautiful
they
thought
than
all
the
others
and
every
night
they
watched
for
it
standing
hand
in
hand
at
a
window
whoever
saw
it
first
cried
out
i
see
the
star
and
often
they
cried
out
both
together
knowing
so
well
when
it
would
rise
and
where
so
they
grew
to
be
such
friends
with
it
that
before
lying
down
in
their
beds
they
always
looked
out
once
again
to
bid
it
good
night
and
when
they
were
turning
round
to
sleep
they
used
to
say
god
bless
the
star
but
while
she
was
still
very
young
o
very
very
young
the
sister
drooped
and
came
to
be
so
weak
that
she
could
no
longer
stand
in
the
window
at
night
and
then
the
child
looked
sadly
out
by
himself
and
when
he
saw
the
star
turned
round
and
said
to
the
patient
pale
face
on
the
bed
i
see
the
star
and
then
a
smile
would
come
upon
the
face
and
a
little
weak
voice
used
to
say
god
bless
my
brother
and
the
star
and
so
the
time
came
all
too
soon
when
the
child
looked
out
alone
and
when
there
was
no
face
on
the
bed
and
when
there
was
a
little
grave
among
the
graves
not
there
before
and
when
the
star
made
long
rays
down
towards
him
as
he
saw
it
through
his
tears
now
these
rays
were
so
bright
and
they
seemed
to
make
such
a
shining
way
from
earth
to
heaven
that
when
the
child
went
to
his
solitary
bed
he
dreamed
about
the
star
and
dreamed
that
lying
where
he
was
he
saw
a
train
of
people
taken
up
that
sparkling
road
by
angels
and
the
star
opening
showed
him
a
great
world
of
light
where
many
more
such
angels
waited
to
receive
them
all
these
angels
who
were
waiting
turned
their
beaming
eyes
upon
the
people
who
were
carried
up
into
the
star
and
some
came
out
from
the
long
rows
in
which
they
stood
and
fell
upon
the
people
s
necks
and
kissed
them
tenderly
and
went
away
with
them
down
avenues
of
light
and
were
so
happy
in
their
company
that
lying
in
his
bed
he
wept
for
joy
but
there
were
many
angels
who
did
not
go
with
them
and
among
them
one
he
knew
the
patient
face
that
once
had
lain
upon
the
bed
was
glorified
and
radiant
but
his
heart
found
out
his
sister
among
all
the
host
his
sister
s
angel
lingered
near
the
entrance
of
the
star
and
said
to
the
leader
among
those
who
had
brought
the
people
thither
is
my
brother
come
and
he
said
she
was
turning
hopefully
away
when
the
child
stretched
out
his
arms
and
cried
o
sister
i
am
here
take
me
and
then
she
turned
her
beaming
eyes
upon
him
and
it
was
night
and
the
star
was
shining
into
the
room
making
long
rays
down
towards
him
as
he
saw
it
through
his
tears
from
that
hour
forth
the
child
looked
out
upon
the
star
as
on
the
home
he
was
to
go
to
when
his
time
should
come
and
he
thought
that
he
did
not
belong
to
the
earth
alone
but
to
the
star
too
because
of
his
sister
s
angel
gone
before
there
was
a
baby
born
to
be
a
brother
to
the
child
and
while
he
was
so
little
that
he
never
yet
had
spoken
word
he
stretched
his
tiny
form
out
on
his
bed
and
died
again
the
child
dreamed
of
the
opened
star
and
of
the
company
of
angels
and
the
train
of
people
and
the
rows
of
angels
with
their
beaming
eyes
all
turned
upon
those
people
s
faces
said
his
sister
s
angel
to
the
leader
is
my
brother
come
and
he
said
not
that
one
but
as
the
child
beheld
his
brother
s
angel
in
her
arms
he
cried
o
sister
i
am
here
take
me
and
she
turned
and
smiled
upon
him
and
the
star
was
shining
he
grew
to
be
a
young
man
and
was
busy
at
his
books
when
an
old
servant
came
to
him
and
said
thy
mother
is
no
more
i
bring
her
blessing
on
her
darling
son
again
at
night
he
saw
the
star
and
all
that
former
company
said
his
sister
s
angel
to
the
leader
is
my
brother
come
and
he
said
thy
mother
a
mighty
cry
of
joy
went
forth
through
all
the
star
because
the
mother
was
reunited
to
her
two
children
and
he
stretched
out
his
arms
and
cried
o
mother
sister
and
brother
i
am
here
take
me
and
they
answered
him
not
and
the
star
was
shining
he
grew
to
be
a
man
whose
hair
was
turning
gray
and
he
was
sitting
in
his
chair
by
the
fireside
heavy
with
grief
and
with
his
face
bedewed
with
tears
when
the
star
opened
once
again
said
his
sister
s
angel
to
the
leader
is
my
brother
come
and
he
said
nay
but
his
maiden
and
the
man
who
had
been
the
child
saw
his
daughter
newly
lost
to
him
a
celestial
creature
among
those
three
and
he
said
my
daughter
s
head
is
on
my
sister
s
bosom
and
her
arm
is
round
my
mother
s
neck
and
at
her
feet
there
is
the
baby
of
old
time
and
i
can
bear
the
parting
from
her
god
be
praised
and
the
star
was
shining
thus
the
child
came
to
be
an
old
man
and
his
once
smooth
face
was
wrinkled
and
his
steps
were
slow
and
feeble
and
his
back
was
bent
and
one
night
as
he
lay
upon
his
bed
his
children
standing
round
he
cried
as
he
had
cried
so
long
ago
i
see
the
star
they
whispered
one
another
he
is
and
he
said
i
am
my
age
is
falling
from
me
like
a
garment
and
i
move
towards
the
star
as
a
child
and
o
my
father
now
i
thank
thee
that
it
has
so
often
opened
to
receive
those
dear
ones
who
await
me
and
the
star
was
shining
and
it
shines
upon
his
grave
