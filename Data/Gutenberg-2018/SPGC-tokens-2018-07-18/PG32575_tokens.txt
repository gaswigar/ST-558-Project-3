chapter
i
a
momentous
decision
it
was
exactly
ten
days
before
the
opening
of
the
autumn
term
at
the
gables
the
september
sunshine
flooding
through
the
window
of
the
principal
study
lighted
up
the
bowl
of
carnations
upon
the
and
flashed
back
from
the
chippendale
mirror
on
the
wall
caught
the
with
the
editions
of
the
poets
showed
up
the
etching
of
dante
dream
over
the
mantelpiece
and
glowed
on
miss
kingsley
ripply
brown
hair
turning
all
the
silver
threads
in
it
to
gold
miss
kingsley
rested
and
refreshed
after
the
long
summer
holiday
a
touch
of
pink
in
her
cheeks
and
a
brightness
in
her
eyes
left
as
a
legacy
from
the
breezes
of
the
cheviot
hills
was
seated
at
her
desk
with
a
notebook
in
front
of
her
and
a
fountain
pen
in
her
hand
making
plans
for
a
fresh
year
work
miss
janet
armed
with
a
stump
of
pencil
and
the
back
of
an
envelope
ready
to
jot
down
suggestions
swayed
to
and
fro
in
the
with
her
lips
drawn
into
a
bunch
and
the
particular
little
pucker
between
her
eyebrows
that
always
came
when
she
was
trying
to
concentrate
her
thoughts
it
really
a
difficulty
janet
said
miss
kingsley
a
suitable
head
girl
makes
all
the
difference
to
a
school
and
if
we
happen
to
choose
the
wrong
one
it
may
completely
spoil
the
tone
if
only
lottie
carson
or
helen
stanley
had
stayed
on
or
even
enid
jones
or
stella
hardy
it
hard
luck
to
lose
all
our
best
senior
girls
at
once
agreed
miss
janet
biting
her
stump
of
pencil
abstractedly
but
if
they
gone
they
gone
of
course
miss
kingsley
tone
savoured
slightly
of
impatience
and
the
urgent
matter
is
to
supply
their
places
it
like
making
bricks
without
straw
have
you
any
suggestions
i
wish
you
stop
rocking
it
worries
me
to
hear
your
chair
creak
miss
janet
seasoned
by
years
acquaintance
with
her
sister
nervous
temperament
rose
and
walked
to
the
window
where
she
stood
looking
out
over
the
sunlit
tennis
court
to
the
bank
of
exotic
shrubs
that
half
hid
the
blue
line
of
the
sea
there
was
a
pause
then
she
said
suppose
you
read
over
the
list
of
and
we
discuss
their
points
each
in
turn
miss
kingsley
reached
for
a
certain
shiny
and
opened
it
the
entries
were
in
her
own
neat
hand
there
will
only
be
eight
girls
in
the
sixth
form
this
term
she
volunteered
taking
them
in
alphabetical
order
they
are
nellie
appleby
claire
bardsley
claudia
castleton
vivien
forrester
lorraine
forrester
audrey
roberts
dorothy
skipton
and
patricia
sullivan
miss
janet
smiled
first
of
all
you
may
cross
off
the
last
she
suggested
decidedly
patsie
sullivan
as
head
girl
would
be
about
as
suitable
as
as
miss
kingsley
paused
for
an
appropriate
simile
as
making
charlie
chaplin
archbishop
of
canterbury
finished
miss
janet
with
a
chuckle
it
unthinkable
most
of
the
others
are
soon
weeded
out
too
nellie
appleby
and
claire
bardsley
good
stodgy
girls
but
quite
unfit
for
leadership
claudia
castleton
a
new
girl
so
of
course
not
eligible
audrey
roberts
could
you
imagine
silly
little
audrey
in
any
post
of
trust
it
really
only
leaves
us
the
choice
between
lorraine
forrester
vivien
forrester
and
dorothy
skipton
in
last
term
exams
these
three
were
fairly
equal
commented
miss
janet
so
equal
that
i
sha
take
the
results
of
the
exams
into
consideration
it
must
be
a
question
of
which
girl
will
make
the
most
efficient
head
each
has
her
points
and
her
drawbacks
take
vivien
now
she
smart
and
capable
and
would
revel
in
exercising
authority
too
much
so
i
should
be
sorry
for
the
school
with
anyone
so
domineering
as
vivien
forrester
at
the
head
of
affairs
she
too
forward
altogether
and
inclined
to
argue
and
pit
her
opinion
against
that
of
the
mistresses
if
she
were
singled
out
for
special
office
i
believe
she
grow
insufferable
dorothy
skipton
with
all
her
faults
would
be
preferable
to
vivien
and
dorothy
faults
very
big
ones
too
sighed
miss
kingsley
i
never
can
consider
dorothy
to
be
absolutely
straight
and
square
several
times
caught
her
cheating
or
copying
and
she
not
above
telling
a
fib
if
she
in
a
tight
place
she
clever
undoubtedly
and
decidedly
popular
and
in
that
lies
the
greatest
danger
for
a
popular
head
girl
whose
moral
attitude
is
not
of
the
very
highest
might
ruin
the
tone
of
the
school
in
a
single
term
i
afraid
dorothy
is
too
risky
an
experiment
then
that
leaves
only
lorraine
forrester
yes
lorraine
both
the
sisters
paused
with
the
same
look
of
puzzled
doubt
on
their
faces
she
a
child
i
never
seem
to
have
got
to
know
thoroughly
said
miss
janet
i
must
say
i
always
found
her
perfectly
square
and
a
plodding
worker
she
has
given
very
little
trouble
in
class
not
so
brilliant
perhaps
as
vivien
but
on
the
whole
more
satisfactory
commented
miss
kingsley
i
agree
with
you
that
we
have
never
really
got
to
know
lorraine
she
a
very
reserved
girl
and
has
pushed
herself
forward
but
there
great
strength
of
character
in
her
in
my
opinion
those
big
brown
eyes
look
in
earnest
over
anything
she
doing
she
never
made
a
bid
for
popularity
like
dorothy
skipton
but
i
seen
her
coaching
the
younger
ones
at
hockey
and
cricket
she
inclined
to
go
about
in
a
dream
but
i
believe
if
she
were
placed
in
a
post
of
authority
she
wake
up
i
really
think
we
could
depend
on
lorraine
the
first
quality
in
a
head
girl
is
that
she
must
be
conscientious
and
she
certainly
comes
out
top
in
that
respect
if
it
were
put
to
the
general
vote
began
miss
janet
but
her
sister
snapped
her
up
i
do
believe
in
allowing
the
girls
a
choice
the
popular
idol
of
the
school
is
always
the
one
with
the
best
influence
i
quite
decided
janet
lorraine
is
far
and
away
the
most
suitable
among
the
new
sixth
i
shall
send
for
her
the
day
before
term
opens
and
have
a
private
talk
with
her
unless
i
very
much
mistaken
in
the
girl
we
sha
be
disappointed
i
believe
you
are
right
agreed
miss
janet
sinking
into
the
and
resuming
her
rocking
without
further
remonstrance
from
her
now
satisfied
sister
miss
kingsley
and
miss
janet
had
kept
school
together
at
the
gables
for
the
last
twelve
years
it
was
not
a
very
large
school
but
then
porthkeverne
was
not
a
very
large
place
only
a
little
quaint
seaside
town
built
down
the
sloping
cliffs
of
a
cornish
cove
with
its
back
to
the
moors
and
its
face
to
the
broad
atlantic
whether
you
appreciated
porthkeverne
or
not
was
entirely
a
matter
of
temperament
strangers
whose
pleasure
in
a
summer
holiday
depended
on
pier
esplanade
band
and
cheap
amusements
found
it
insufferably
dull
and
left
for
the
more
flaring
gaieties
of
or
trewenlock
head
porthkeverne
was
glad
to
get
rid
of
them
it
did
not
cater
for
such
as
these
but
there
were
others
for
whom
the
little
town
had
a
peculiar
fascination
its
quaint
irregular
houses
and
grey
roofs
its
narrow
streets
of
steep
steps
its
archways
with
glimpses
of
the
sea
its
picturesque
harbour
and
its
exotic
shrubs
and
early
flowers
its
yellow
sands
and
great
pinnacled
crags
the
softness
of
the
west
wind
and
the
perpetual
dull
roll
of
the
atlantic
breakers
cast
a
spell
over
certain
natures
and
compelled
them
to
remain
visitors
would
return
to
it
again
and
again
and
some
of
them
who
were
free
to
live
where
they
chose
would
take
houses
and
settle
down
as
residents
over
literary
and
artistic
people
porthkeverne
seemed
to
exercise
a
special
charm
authors
and
artists
had
collected
there
and
partly
attracted
by
the
place
and
partly
by
each
society
had
formed
an
intellectual
colony
that
centred
round
the
arts
club
in
the
old
guildhall
down
by
the
harbour
marine
painters
and
those
who
sought
to
immortalize
peasant
life
on
their
canvases
found
ample
subjects
among
the
crags
and
coves
and
rocks
where
the
blue
water
lapped
softly
or
the
white
waves
came
foaming
and
churning
up
and
the
bronzed
and
straight
of
limb
were
models
to
set
the
heart
of
a
millet
or
a
wilkie
on
the
thrill
to
authors
the
quiet
place
with
its
miles
of
moorland
lying
inland
from
the
cliffs
was
a
ripe
field
for
literary
work
novelists
worked
out
their
plots
undisturbed
by
the
hooting
of
motor
horns
or
the
whizzing
of
scientific
men
who
had
spent
years
of
study
over
the
treasures
of
the
british
museum
or
kew
came
there
to
sort
out
their
materials
for
books
of
reference
and
to
have
leisure
for
making
certain
experiments
writers
of
travels
reviewed
their
notes
and
archaeologists
scheduled
the
antiquities
of
the
neighbourhood
to
this
literary
and
artistic
brotherhood
porthkeverne
offered
the
calm
of
the
country
combined
with
the
mental
stimulus
of
intellectual
comradeship
and
though
in
the
inevitable
march
of
events
its
individual
members
often
changed
the
colony
remained
and
flourished
and
sent
forth
work
of
a
character
that
was
of
value
to
the
world
of
art
and
letters
miss
kingsley
and
her
sister
miss
janet
themselves
women
of
strong
literary
tastes
had
come
to
the
town
with
the
rising
tide
of
the
arts
settlement
and
had
established
their
school
chiefly
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
new
colony
most
of
their
pupils
were
the
children
of
painters
and
authors
though
a
few
of
the
gentry
and
professional
men
of
the
district
also
took
advantage
of
such
a
good
local
opportunity
to
educate
their
daughters
the
gables
was
a
pleasant
white
house
standing
on
a
narrow
terrace
of
the
cliff
with
a
high
rock
behind
to
screen
it
from
the
wind
and
a
view
of
grey
leading
down
to
a
peep
of
the
harbour
in
the
sheltered
garden
grew
according
to
their
season
white
arum
lilies
and
rosy
tamarisk
aloes
and
myrtle
and
oleander
and
other
beautiful
shrubs
while
geraniums
carnations
and
humbler
flowers
bloomed
in
profusion
there
was
a
veranda
covered
with
a
wistaria
and
most
of
the
windows
were
framed
with
creepers
long
afterwards
when
the
pupils
looked
back
to
their
time
at
the
gables
they
would
always
connect
certain
lessons
with
the
strong
scent
of
honeysuckle
or
the
faint
odour
of
tea
roses
for
the
flowers
seemed
just
as
much
a
part
of
the
general
culture
of
the
school
as
were
the
botticelli
pictures
on
the
library
walls
or
the
weekly
recitals
of
modern
music
this
garden
miss
kingsley
fetish
and
the
joy
of
miss
janet
heart
was
blooming
its
best
on
the
particular
september
afternoon
when
the
autumn
term
began
soon
after
two
its
green
lawn
and
shady
paths
began
to
fill
up
with
girls
they
came
at
first
in
twos
and
threes
and
then
in
larger
numbers
till
the
place
seemed
full
of
them
there
were
only
about
forty
altogether
but
it
was
seven
weeks
since
most
of
them
had
met
one
another
and
the
babel
of
tongues
that
ensued
would
have
suggested
a
hundred
children
at
the
least
six
juniors
occupied
the
with
as
many
more
hanging
over
the
back
a
dozen
of
the
smaller
fry
squatted
on
the
grass
some
frivolous
intermediates
cackled
over
jokes
in
the
corner
by
the
bay
tree
and
a
few
enterprising
spirits
had
mounted
the
wall
to
watch
for
here
aileen
and
grace
with
her
little
sister
and
effie
after
all
though
she
was
sure
she
be
back
in
time
good
old
effie
i
glad
she
come
where
marcia
by
the
by
gone
to
the
high
school
at
st
jude
poor
wretch
i
sorry
for
her
what
a
traipse
to
go
by
train
every
morning
why
here
doreen
and
she
cut
her
hair
short
oh
i
say
doreen
old
sport
i
hardly
knew
you
what
a
kid
you
look
doreen
shook
back
her
shock
of
crisp
brown
hair
conscious
of
the
pleasing
fact
that
it
curled
at
the
ends
kid
indeed
she
replied
with
an
indignant
thrill
in
her
voice
i
was
thirteen
last
week
should
have
thought
it
twittered
enid
i
was
just
going
to
suggest
a
pair
of
socks
and
shoes
there
a
new
teacher
for
the
kindergarten
if
that
interests
you
there
do
get
raggy
perhaps
you
find
yourself
in
the
sixth
after
all
no
thank
you
i
no
yearnings
to
be
in
the
oxford
room
i
suppose
we
shall
all
be
going
up
a
form
though
who
are
the
monitresses
this
year
have
you
heard
enid
slipped
down
from
her
post
on
the
wall
and
locking
her
arm
in
doreen
strolled
with
her
towards
the
house
not
a
word
she
replied
until
the
great
panjandrum
reads
out
the
lists
we
utterly
and
entirely
in
the
dark
of
course
most
of
those
who
were
in
the
fifth
last
year
will
have
gone
up
into
the
sixth
except
perhaps
beryl
woodhouse
and
moira
stanning
but
i
been
talking
it
over
with
vera
and
pansy
and
they
both
agree
it
an
absolute
who
to
be
head
girl
why
how
extraordinary
i
should
have
said
there
was
any
doubt
about
it
there
only
one
girl
who
in
the
least
likely
which
one
vivien
of
course
enid
pulled
an
eloquent
face
it
not
course
i
for
one
heartily
hope
she
get
it
vivien
forrester
as
she
is
is
quite
bad
enough
but
vivien
forrester
as
head
of
the
school
would
be
the
absolute
limit
she
be
chosen
all
the
same
you
see
there
really
is
anybody
else
when
lily
anderson
left
last
term
she
certainly
thought
vivien
was
going
to
be
her
successor
she
showed
her
how
to
keep
all
the
books
of
the
clubs
and
guilds
so
that
she
could
slide
into
the
work
easily
and
vivien
such
a
sport
at
hockey
too
um
i
do
know
she
has
such
a
jolly
good
opinion
of
her
own
cleverness
but
the
question
is
whether
miss
kingsley
exactly
shares
it
or
not
hello
hold
me
up
here
comes
the
duchess
herself
as
large
as
life
the
girl
who
advanced
briskly
from
the
rhododendron
walk
would
have
been
good
looking
but
she
was
spoilt
by
a
rather
rabbity
mouth
and
large
teeth
her
complexion
was
clear
her
brown
eyes
were
bright
and
her
auburn
hair
was
abundant
she
held
herself
with
the
confidence
of
one
who
has
so
far
found
life
an
unqualified
success
in
her
wake
followed
a
little
train
of
courtiers
sybil
snow
nellie
appleby
mona
parker
phœbe
gibson
and
adelaide
brookfield
all
eager
sycophants
craving
her
favour
and
doing
their
utmost
to
ingratiate
themselves
i
tell
you
i
ca
promise
anything
vivien
was
saying
naturally
the
head
of
the
school
has
the
power
to
appoint
any
secretaries
she
likes
but
it
be
time
enough
to
decide
these
things
afterwards
i
wish
you
would
bother
me
so
there
be
a
proper
committee
meeting
on
friday
to
arrange
the
societies
and
you
must
just
wait
till
then
but
if
anybody
speaks
to
you
about
it
in
the
meantime
you
remember
it
the
dramatic
i
keenest
on
urged
phœbe
plaintively
i
tell
you
again
i
ca
promise
but
well
i
do
my
best
for
you
at
any
rate
what
this
about
the
dramatic
broke
in
dorothy
skipton
who
arm
in
arm
with
patsie
sullivan
had
joined
the
group
do
you
mean
to
say
you
arranging
the
societies
beforehand
really
vivien
forrester
of
all
cool
cheek
i
call
this
the
very
limit
who
said
were
going
to
be
head
girl
i
should
like
to
know
two
red
spots
flared
into
vivien
cheeks
nobody
said
so
she
retorted
certainly
did
though
i
dare
say
i
as
good
a
chance
as
anybody
else
i
do
see
why
you
need
catch
me
up
like
this
little
bit
tall
to
be
promising
posts
till
you
certain
you
top
dog
laughed
patsie
old
dorothy
may
be
the
lucker
instead
of
you
rather
not
i
can
hardly
flatter
myself
after
my
career
last
term
that
i
be
chosen
as
pattern
pupil
and
pitchforked
into
the
post
of
honour
to
set
a
good
example
to
the
rest
of
the
school
do
i
the
part
now
the
others
surveying
patsie
humorous
face
and
twinkling
grey
eyes
broke
into
a
universal
chuckle
well
it
hardly
your
line
exactly
admitted
vivien
why
if
you
confiscated
surreptitious
sweets
from
the
kids
you
probably
eat
them
before
their
indignant
faces
and
give
them
a
tip
on
how
to
hide
them
more
carefully
in
future
i
know
you
joking
apart
though
said
dorothy
i
suppose
somebody
be
made
head
of
this
school
has
any
one
got
the
least
inkling
or
hint
lorraine
lorraine
forrester
come
here
we
talking
about
who
to
be
head
girl
it
a
burning
question
is
it
do
you
know
anything
the
schoolmate
addressed
as
lorraine
closed
with
a
slam
the
book
she
was
reading
and
advanced
somewhat
unwillingly
she
was
a
slim
pretty
girl
of
sixteen
with
the
general
effect
of
an
autumn
woodland
everything
about
her
seemed
golden
brown
her
hazel
eyes
her
creamy
complexion
the
sunny
glint
in
her
rich
dark
hair
were
emphasized
by
the
brown
dress
she
was
wearing
and
the
orange
carnations
pinned
in
her
belt
at
the
first
glance
there
was
a
certain
likeness
to
vivien
for
the
girls
were
cousins
yet
everything
about
lorraine
seemed
of
a
slightly
superior
quality
as
if
she
had
been
turned
out
of
a
finer
mould
she
flushed
as
she
evaded
dorothy
question
i
suppose
we
shall
all
know
when
miss
kingsley
tells
us
she
answered
we
be
duffers
if
we
did
mocked
patsie
in
my
opinion
have
an
uncommonly
good
innings
and
i
getting
ready
to
congratulate
her
no
no
it
be
vivien
declared
mona
yes
vivien
agreed
sybil
and
phœbe
together
but
at
that
moment
the
loud
clanging
of
the
bell
put
a
stop
to
the
conversation
and
the
girls
turned
in
a
body
and
hurried
into
the
house
chapter
ii
the
first
day
of
term
it
was
an
custom
at
the
gables
that
the
autumn
term
should
begin
on
a
tuesday
afternoon
there
were
no
lessons
the
girls
simply
gathered
together
in
the
gymnasium
to
listen
to
a
short
address
from
miss
kingsley
to
be
told
in
what
forms
they
were
placed
for
the
coming
school
year
and
to
be
given
new
with
passages
to
prepare
for
the
morrow
when
serious
work
would
begin
at
nine
and
the
wheels
of
school
life
would
start
to
turn
in
real
earnest
this
first
afternoon
was
regarded
by
most
as
somewhat
in
the
nature
of
a
festival
it
was
pleasant
to
meet
again
and
compare
notes
about
the
holidays
the
general
change
of
forms
lent
an
element
of
excitement
even
the
new
books
were
more
or
less
interesting
and
many
minor
details
gave
variety
to
the
occasion
the
gymnasium
whither
all
the
girls
were
scuttling
was
a
wooden
building
that
had
been
erected
in
days
at
the
side
of
the
house
it
served
for
many
purposes
and
was
alternately
art
gallery
or
as
the
case
might
be
this
afternoon
with
a
fresh
coat
of
pink
distemper
a
big
bowl
of
flowers
upon
the
table
and
the
sunshine
coming
through
the
skylight
roof
and
shining
on
the
floor
and
rows
of
varnished
forms
it
looked
both
and
attractive
the
girls
trooped
in
and
took
their
seats
there
were
a
few
elder
ones
but
the
majority
were
between
eight
and
fourteen
with
perhaps
half
a
dozen
kindergarten
children
on
the
front
bench
miss
turner
standing
near
the
piano
controlled
any
excess
of
conversation
and
reduced
it
to
a
subdued
murmur
as
miss
kingsley
brisk
smiling
and
with
a
now
we
get
to
work
air
about
her
mounted
the
platform
and
stood
to
review
her
school
pupils
rose
to
their
feet
and
eyes
were
fixed
obediently
upon
her
face
she
focused
their
attention
for
a
moment
then
nodding
to
miss
paget
who
was
seated
at
the
piano
she
announced
we
will
begin
the
new
term
as
usual
by
singing
the
national
anthem
miss
paget
struck
a
few
chords
and
then
the
familiar
strains
of
god
save
the
king
rang
through
the
room
it
made
a
good
commencement
for
new
girls
and
even
the
kindergarten
babies
could
sing
it
and
thus
take
their
part
at
once
with
the
school
voices
some
fresh
and
clear
and
some
more
or
less
out
of
tune
joined
heartily
in
the
anthem
and
the
girls
sat
down
with
the
consciousness
of
having
made
a
united
effort
following
her
precedent
of
twelve
years
miss
kingsley
had
something
to
say
to
her
pupils
before
she
made
the
ordinary
announcements
of
school
arrangements
it
always
nice
to
feel
we
making
a
fresh
start
she
began
cheerfully
this
is
a
new
school
year
and
i
want
you
all
to
join
in
helping
to
make
it
the
best
we
ever
had
if
there
are
any
girls
here
who
have
done
well
before
now
is
the
time
for
them
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
and
show
us
that
they
can
work
at
this
crisis
in
the
affairs
we
do
want
to
bring
up
your
fathers
uncles
brothers
cousins
have
answered
their
country
call
and
gone
to
defend
britain
honour
and
you
have
been
proud
to
see
them
go
the
women
of
the
empire
have
played
their
part
as
nobly
as
the
men
and
it
is
these
brave
and
splendid
women
whom
you
must
try
to
imitate
do
you
think
they
would
have
been
able
to
give
the
help
they
have
given
to
their
country
unless
they
had
prepared
their
characters
for
it
beforehand
i
sure
not
it
in
the
classroom
that
we
train
ourselves
for
what
we
may
do
afterwards
every
girl
who
tries
her
best
in
the
little
world
of
school
is
learning
her
part
for
the
big
world
afterwards
we
hope
it
is
going
to
be
a
beautiful
world
when
the
war
is
over
but
it
can
only
be
so
if
we
remember
the
sacrifices
that
have
been
made
and
determine
to
be
worthy
of
those
who
gave
up
everything
for
us
nation
never
rises
higher
than
its
women
so
you
who
are
going
to
be
some
of
its
women
must
see
to
it
that
you
raise
and
not
lower
the
standard
it
a
happy
hopeful
thought
to
feel
that
you
helping
to
push
the
world
on
and
how
splendid
if
we
can
think
that
the
gables
is
a
centre
from
which
real
helpfulness
may
radiate
let
us
all
join
in
trying
to
make
it
so
going
to
tell
you
now
about
some
things
we
shall
be
busy
with
this
term
and
i
hope
you
will
throw
all
your
energies
into
them
and
try
your
utmost
to
make
them
a
success
miss
kingsley
passed
in
rapid
review
the
general
scheme
of
work
for
the
term
for
both
seniors
and
juniors
it
was
a
full
programme
and
included
a
wide
range
of
subjects
from
lectures
on
greek
antiquities
to
swedish
drill
and
rhythmic
dancing
she
was
modern
in
her
methods
and
wished
to
cultivate
every
side
of
a
child
nature
till
she
was
old
enough
to
choose
her
own
speciality
lists
of
the
various
forms
followed
and
then
miss
kingsley
turned
to
what
in
the
estimation
of
some
of
the
girls
at
least
was
the
most
important
announcement
of
the
afternoon
all
members
of
the
sixth
are
appointed
monitresses
and
lorraine
forrester
is
head
of
the
school
a
wave
of
excitement
surged
instantly
through
the
room
lorraine
they
had
not
in
the
least
expected
her
to
be
chosen
so
far
she
had
seemed
a
rather
retiring
sort
of
girl
who
had
not
taken
a
very
active
part
in
school
affairs
last
term
when
war
waged
hot
and
strong
between
lottie
carson
and
helen
stanley
two
of
the
monitresses
lorraine
had
committed
herself
to
neither
party
though
her
form
was
divided
to
such
an
extent
of
partisanship
that
dorothy
skipton
and
vivien
forrester
nearly
had
a
fight
one
day
on
the
landing
lorraine
the
matter
required
thought
the
school
was
so
surprised
that
it
could
not
decide
how
to
take
the
announcement
and
it
was
with
a
look
of
uncertainty
on
their
faces
that
the
girls
dismissed
at
last
by
miss
kingsley
filed
into
their
classrooms
to
receive
their
new
books
and
be
told
their
preparation
for
next
day
this
necessary
business
finished
they
were
free
to
don
hats
and
coats
and
go
home
in
the
the
conversation
bubbled
over
well
what
think
of
it
exploded
dorothy
patsie
sitting
on
the
pulling
on
her
shoes
made
a
round
mouth
and
whistled
it
generally
the
unexpected
that
happens
she
moralized
a
lucker
cheer
up
old
dollie
do
look
so
glum
bother
i
broken
my
what
a
grizzly
nuisance
lorraine
not
such
a
bad
sort
after
all
i
do
say
she
is
but
to
be
head
of
the
school
better
than
vivien
anyway
grunted
patsie
busy
knotting
her
broken
i
agree
with
you
there
have
turned
the
place
upside
down
here
she
comes
in
a
tantrum
by
the
look
of
her
vivien
judging
by
the
way
she
slammed
down
her
new
books
was
certainly
not
pleased
with
the
turn
affairs
had
taken
though
she
and
dorothy
were
generally
on
terms
of
flint
and
steel
she
sought
her
now
to
air
what
she
considered
a
common
grievance
i
could
have
believed
it
of
miss
kingsley
she
began
why
lorraine
of
all
people
in
the
world
she
two
months
younger
than
i
am
and
her
marks
were
as
good
as
yours
in
the
exam
if
it
been
for
that
absurd
essay
that
counted
extra
how
she
ever
going
to
manage
to
run
the
societies
i
ca
imagine
i
sorry
for
the
school
dorothy
was
adjusting
her
attractive
hat
in
front
of
the
mirror
she
put
in
the
pins
carefully
before
replying
it
a
rotten
business
she
sighed
disgusting
to
have
lorraine
set
over
us
while
you
and
i
are
just
ordinary
common
monitresses
the
same
as
audrey
roberts
or
nellie
appleby
i
fed
up
with
it
it
going
to
be
a
hateful
term
i
take
an
interest
in
anything
i
wish
i
asked
father
to
send
me
to
a
i
sick
of
the
gables
patsie
whose
was
now
triumphantly
mended
chuckled
softly
poor
old
gables
she
remarked
i
do
know
that
you
find
a
hole
so
easily
it
a
very
decent
kind
of
school
intend
to
have
some
fun
here
this
term
if
do
when
that
rhythmic
dancing
that
kingie
talked
about
going
to
begin
i
saw
some
in
london
and
just
wild
to
do
it
this
is
how
it
goes
and
patsie
flinging
out
her
arms
and
swaying
from
side
to
side
made
a
series
of
most
extraordinary
gyrations
vivien
and
dorothy
burst
out
laughing
if
what
you
call
rhythmic
dancing
give
me
the
good
sort
hinnied
vivien
you
look
about
as
graceful
as
an
elephant
and
as
jerky
as
a
waxwork
declared
dorothy
uncomplimentarily
well
of
course
the
movements
are
done
to
music
they
look
quite
different
when
you
got
a
sort
of
classic
greek
dress
on
and
somebody
playing
a
study
by
chaminade
or
debussy
it
would
need
very
good
music
indeed
to
make
antics
look
anything
i
fancy
you
shine
more
at
hockey
patsie
i
wonder
going
to
happen
to
the
team
i
ca
fancy
lorraine
taking
lily
anderson
place
it
be
a
all
round
this
term
with
lorraine
sh
here
lorraine
herself
then
i
off
come
along
dorothy
vivien
rammed
her
hat
on
anyhow
seized
her
pile
of
new
books
and
bolted
from
the
almost
as
her
cousin
entered
patsie
following
more
leisurely
stopped
en
route
to
give
the
new
head
girl
a
hearty
smack
on
the
back
cheero
lorraine
she
remarked
just
at
the
moment
you
look
like
atlas
shouldering
the
heavens
have
you
got
over
the
shock
of
the
announcement
yet
did
kingie
spring
it
on
you
all
at
once
or
had
she
prepared
you
beforehand
for
your
laurels
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
sent
for
me
yesterday
and
told
me
smiled
lorraine
and
i
suppose
like
julius
cæsar
you
waved
away
the
crown
or
was
it
oliver
cromwell
by
the
by
my
history
always
shaky
well
i
felt
inclined
to
have
a
few
dozen
fits
certainly
i
do
say
it
exactly
a
cushy
post
but
you
a
lucker
all
the
same
old
dolly
and
the
duchess
would
have
liked
to
butt
in
i
can
tell
you
they
absolutely
green
the
pair
of
them
lorraine
face
clouded
i
was
afraid
vivien
would
be
disappointed
she
thought
and
so
did
i
indeed
everybody
thought
then
they
thought
wrong
and
a
good
thing
too
pronounced
patsie
take
my
advice
lorraine
and
do
stand
any
nonsense
with
vivien
kingie
the
right
to
make
anybody
head
girl
she
wants
and
i
glad
she
chosen
you
if
the
duchess
and
old
dollie
ca
lose
in
a
sporting
way
they
blighters
you
hold
your
own
and
i
back
you
up
have
most
of
the
school
on
your
side
and
cheer
up
old
sport
patsie
jolly
and
slangy
swung
out
of
the
with
what
she
called
a
khaki
stride
lorraine
looked
after
her
and
laughed
no
one
took
patsie
seriously
but
it
was
pleasant
to
feel
that
she
was
an
ally
even
though
she
might
not
prove
a
very
stout
prop
to
lean
upon
that
she
would
need
all
available
help
in
her
new
task
lorraine
was
well
aware
it
would
be
difficult
to
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
so
capable
and
energetic
a
head
girl
as
lily
anderson
the
irrepressible
intermediates
were
likely
to
prove
a
handful
and
in
the
ranks
of
the
sixth
itself
she
foresaw
trouble
brewing
it
was
a
decidedly
thoughtful
lorraine
who
walked
down
the
school
garden
out
through
the
gate
and
along
the
cliff
road
that
led
to
the
western
portion
of
the
town
she
had
reached
the
wall
below
the
windmill
when
monica
her
old
sister
came
panting
after
her
lorraine
do
wait
why
did
you
go
off
without
me
i
hunted
for
you
everywhere
till
ida
james
told
me
you
gone
what
a
blighter
you
are
to
leave
me
sorry
cuckoo
but
you
see
i
thought
gone
so
there
we
are
said
lorraine
smiling
indulgently
at
the
impetuous
little
figure
that
overtook
her
and
seized
her
arm
i
have
waited
if
i
known
i
forgive
you
accorded
monica
graciously
only
of
all
days
of
course
i
wanted
to
walk
home
with
you
know
tibbiekins
proud
of
you
are
you
bucked
well
you
ought
to
be
i
never
got
such
a
surprise
in
my
life
as
when
forrester
was
read
out
of
the
school
betty
farmer
pinched
me
so
hard
that
i
nearly
yelled
but
i
say
tibbie
it
a
stunt
did
you
get
nerve
shock
when
you
heard
your
name
i
knew
yesterday
what
was
coming
admitted
lorraine
was
that
why
you
went
to
see
miss
kingsley
and
you
never
told
me
a
word
well
i
think
you
are
the
limit
miss
kingsley
made
me
promise
on
my
honour
not
to
tell
a
single
soul
i
could
have
helped
telling
think
of
having
that
secret
all
the
evening
and
not
giving
me
the
least
teeny
weeny
atom
of
a
hint
even
i
wonder
you
could
keep
it
in
the
girls
are
pleased
most
of
them
betty
says
you
a
sport
and
mabel
king
says
she
feels
she
going
to
worship
you
and
nora
hyland
said
i
was
a
lucker
to
have
you
for
a
sister
of
course
a
few
of
them
had
plumped
for
vivien
and
let
off
steam
but
they
soon
get
over
it
vivien
looked
like
a
thunder
cloud
she
wo
forgive
you
in
a
hurry
you
may
look
out
for
squalls
in
her
quarter
hallo
here
rosemary
come
to
meet
us
i
must
tell
her
the
news
she
knows
already
why
you
said
it
was
a
secret
well
you
are
mean
to
have
told
rosemary
and
not
i
not
friends
with
you
any
more
so
there
lorraine
answered
her
elder
sister
look
of
enquiry
with
a
nod
of
comprehension
yes
it
all
fait
she
replied
and
on
the
whole
i
think
the
school
has
borne
it
beautifully
come
along
cuckoo
pout
rosemary
must
have
some
secrets
i
ca
tell
to
the
family
baby
remember
you
score
in
other
ways
it
luck
to
be
born
youngest
the
three
girls
turned
in
at
a
gate
and
walked
up
a
drive
to
a
comfortable
house
pendlehurst
was
a
modern
house
and
in
lorraine
opinion
not
at
all
romantic
but
with
the
exception
of
herself
the
forrester
family
was
not
particularly
given
to
romance
her
father
in
choosing
a
residence
had
paid
more
attention
to
drains
number
of
bedrooms
and
facilities
than
to
artistic
beauty
or
æsthetic
associations
he
was
a
practical
man
with
a
bent
towards
mathematics
and
counted
the
cubic
space
necessary
for
the
requirements
of
seven
children
to
be
the
matter
of
most
importance
he
had
an
practice
as
a
solicitor
in
the
town
and
had
lived
all
his
life
at
porthkeverne
of
the
large
family
of
children
only
the
three
youngest
remained
at
home
richard
and
donald
were
at
the
front
in
the
thick
of
the
fighting
rodney
was
in
training
for
the
air
force
while
rosemary
anxious
also
to
flutter
from
the
nest
and
try
her
wings
in
the
world
was
to
go
to
london
to
study
singing
at
a
college
of
music
her
term
began
a
little
later
than
lorraine
so
the
two
girls
had
still
a
few
days
left
to
spend
together
they
ran
upstairs
now
to
their
joint
bedroom
where
packing
was
in
progress
a
big
box
stood
under
the
window
with
a
bottom
layer
of
and
music
tightly
arranged
to
rosemary
it
meant
the
fulfilment
of
a
dream
as
she
looked
at
it
her
imagination
skipped
three
or
four
years
and
showed
her
a
golden
vision
of
herself
in
a
pale
pink
satin
dress
with
a
pearl
necklace
standing
on
a
concert
platform
and
bowing
repeatedly
to
the
storm
of
applause
which
had
greeted
her
song
i
ca
tell
you
how
hard
i
going
to
work
she
confided
i
shall
just
practise
and
practise
and
practise
i
know
that
wretched
theory
will
rather
stump
me
but
i
wrestle
with
it
there
be
such
a
musical
atmosphere
about
the
place
it
ca
help
inspiring
one
the
hostel
will
be
fun
too
said
lorraine
going
down
on
her
knees
to
inspect
the
dainty
afternoon
tea
service
that
was
being
rolled
up
for
safety
in
soft
articles
of
clothing
i
can
just
picture
you
in
your
room
making
a
cup
of
cocoa
before
you
go
to
bed
and
having
in
a
few
friends
it
be
the
time
of
my
life
i
always
wanted
to
go
to
boarding
school
but
this
will
be
even
better
because
in
a
way
i
shall
be
my
own
mistress
i
never
thought
i
work
dad
round
to
it
i
been
in
a
sort
of
quiver
ever
since
he
said
there
as
a
loud
series
of
rappings
resounded
on
the
door
oh
i
ca
have
you
children
in
here
just
now
go
away
we
come
in
urged
monica
following
up
her
words
by
a
forcible
entrance
there
there
do
get
excited
you
us
when
you
know
what
we
come
for
chips
and
i
have
brought
you
a
present
we
thought
you
like
to
pack
it
now
mervyn
otherwise
chips
an
overgrown
boy
of
thirteen
was
embracing
a
large
parcel
which
he
plumped
on
the
floor
and
unfolded
it
contained
a
fretwork
basket
stained
brown
and
still
rather
sticky
with
varnish
the
corners
fitted
indifferently
and
the
handle
was
slightly
askew
we
made
it
between
us
said
mervyn
proudly
it
either
do
for
a
or
you
could
plant
ferns
in
it
and
have
it
in
your
window
you
did
guess
the
least
little
atom
what
we
were
doing
did
you
asked
monica
anxiously
not
a
scrap
said
rosemary
gallantly
accepting
the
embarrassing
offering
with
the
enthusiasm
it
demanded
you
dears
to
have
made
it
for
me
i
can
keep
all
sorts
of
things
in
it
cocoa
and
condensed
milk
and
bits
of
string
and
everything
i
likely
to
lose
thanks
ever
so
is
it
a
little
sticky
to
pack
yet
not
said
mervyn
applying
a
finger
as
practical
demonstration
i
glad
you
like
it
it
our
first
really
big
bit
of
work
with
those
fret
saws
now
cuckoo
if
you
want
to
come
there
be
just
time
to
develop
those
films
before
tea
when
the
children
had
gone
rosemary
lifted
up
the
rather
crooked
basket
looked
at
it
critically
and
laughed
i
sure
it
was
a
labour
of
love
she
commented
of
course
i
shall
have
to
take
it
with
me
though
it
will
be
a
nuisance
to
pack
and
they
so
proud
of
it
i
hope
my
own
first
efforts
at
the
college
of
music
wo
be
considered
equally
crude
by
the
authorities
or
mine
at
the
gables
we
each
starting
on
new
lines
this
term
what
heaps
and
loads
we
shall
have
to
talk
about
at
christmas
chapter
iii
new
brooms
a
week
later
rosemary
trailing
clouds
of
glory
in
the
family
estimation
departed
for
the
classic
precincts
of
the
college
of
music
and
lorraine
left
behind
shook
off
the
atmosphere
of
detachment
which
always
pervades
an
exodus
and
focused
her
full
mind
and
energies
upon
the
gables
it
was
no
light
thing
to
be
chosen
as
head
girl
miss
kingsley
in
that
private
talk
in
the
study
had
urged
the
responsibility
as
well
as
the
honour
of
the
office
lorraine
did
not
mean
to
disappoint
her
if
she
could
help
it
she
set
to
work
at
once
to
wrestle
with
the
problem
of
an
autumn
programme
for
the
school
in
virtue
of
her
office
she
was
president
of
all
the
various
existing
guilds
and
societies
and
had
the
power
to
enlarge
curtail
or
reorganize
at
her
discretion
although
in
a
sense
she
was
supreme
referee
she
had
no
desire
to
ride
over
the
general
wishes
so
as
a
preliminary
to
any
proposed
changes
she
called
a
monitresses
meeting
the
seven
girls
who
with
herself
made
up
the
sixth
form
assembled
in
the
after
school
interested
and
on
the
whole
ready
for
business
audrey
to
be
sure
was
giggling
as
usual
patsie
was
pulling
an
absurd
face
of
mock
dignity
but
nellie
and
claire
were
pleased
with
their
new
importance
vivien
rather
sulky
though
submitting
perforce
to
play
second
fiddle
had
patched
up
a
temporary
truce
with
dorothy
and
the
pair
settled
side
by
side
claudia
the
fresh
addition
to
the
form
strolled
in
late
and
sat
crocheting
while
the
others
talked
lorraine
her
lap
full
of
minutes
books
bristled
with
ideas
lily
anderson
the
former
head
girl
had
been
energetic
and
enterprising
to
an
extent
that
was
really
worthy
of
a
wider
sphere
her
standard
had
soared
so
high
that
the
school
had
been
quite
unable
to
live
up
to
it
in
her
excess
of
zeal
she
had
founded
too
many
societies
and
with
such
strict
and
arduous
rules
that
they
would
have
tried
the
spirit
of
a
candidate
for
initiation
into
some
mystic
brotherhood
urged
on
by
her
enthusiasm
the
members
had
made
a
desperate
first
spurt
and
then
had
slacked
lamentably
the
records
of
their
brief
successes
and
subsequent
were
chronicled
in
certain
lorraine
fresh
from
a
perusal
of
these
annals
began
the
meeting
with
a
drastic
suggestion
as
things
stand
at
present
she
said
the
school
seems
with
societies
this
is
an
exact
list
of
them
research

nineteen
in
all
commented
patsie
who
had
been
checking
off
the
items
on
her
fingers
rather
stiff
for
a
school
of
forty
girls
nodded
dorothy
sagely
there
are
far
too
many
to
keep
up
properly
urged
lorraine
every
hobby
we
ever
had
has
been
turned
into
a
society
if
we
had
no
lessons
to
do
we
could
scarcely
have
managed
them
all
but
when
they
must
come
out
of
our
spare
time
it
gets
quite
a
tax
i
think
we
be
quite
so
ambitious
this
year
suppose
we
let
some
of
them
drop
and
concentrate
on
just
a
few
i
your
man
agreed
patsie
i
always
thought
such
heaps
of
societies
were
a
grizzly
nuisance
it
got
the
limit
when
two
or
three
girls
could
even
compare
post
cards
without
being
turned
into
a
guild
those
kids
in
the
second
form
actually
had
a
society
for
collecting
stumps
of
lead
pencil
and
used
to
steal
them
shamelessly
from
any
boxes
that
were
left
about
in
the
gym
the
habit
has
grown
into
a
perfect
mania
with
the
school
best
whittle
them
down
said
vivien
who
had
herself
suffered
at
the
hands
of
the
too
enthusiastic
lily
anderson
which
do
you
propose
to
shelve
and
which
to
keep
asked
dorothy
lorraine
opened
the
biggest
and
fattest
exercise
book
this
is
gables
guild
she
explained
a
sort
of
foundation
society
that
includes
all
the
others
as
branches
miss
kingsley
is
the
patron
and
she
has
written
on
the
first
page
union
for
and
philanthropy
being
and
doing
oh
goodness
what
does
that
mean
i
a
duffer
at
long
words
protested
audrey
ca
you
put
it
into
english
well
it
means
we
got
to
do
something
for
ourselves
and
something
for
other
people
too
that
simpler
we
plenty
to
choose
from
out
of
nineteen
branches
said
nellie
do
you
think
it
would
hit
the
mark
if
we
had
a
games
club
to
include
hockey
cricket
and
tennis
an
entertainments
club
to
get
up
plays
and
concerts
and
a
nature
study
union
that
could
absorb
the
research
society
and
the
natural
history
league
both
together
these
would
be
for
ourselves
then
for
the
side
we
could
keep
on
the
jack
tar
club
and
let
the
needlework
society
and
the
home
arts
guild
send
anything
they
make
to
that
what
the
tar
club
please
asked
claudia
looking
up
from
her
crochet
it
to
give
christmas
presents
to
the
sailors
and
their
wives
and
children
we
packed
off
a
huge
big
box
to
portsmouth
last
year
lily
anderson
and
lottie
watson
and
helen
stanley
made
some
gorgeous
things
and
revelled
in
doing
them
and
the
rest
of
us
toiled
and
groaned
and
grumbled
and
ended
by
borrowing
and
begging
from
our
relations
twinkled
patsie
do
think
you
keep
that
crochet
edging
for
yourself
dame
claudia
it
be
commandeered
to
go
round
a
for
a
jack
tar
i
shall
probably
never
finish
enough
of
it
even
to
edge
a
admitted
claudia
calmly
look
here
this
is
said
lorraine
rapping
her
pencil
on
the
desk
please
to
remember
that
this
is
a
committee
meeting
and
you
must
speak
to
the
chair
wo
anybody
make
a
proposition
i
propose
that
we
have
what
you
just
suggested
then
a
club
an
club
a
study
union
and
the
tar
club
said
dorothy
and
quite
enough
too
murmured
patsie
i
second
it
declared
nellie
i
like
to
add
an
amendment
said
lorraine
i
want
to
suggest
that
we
have
a
school
social
every
month
where
we
can
show
specimens
and
drawings
and
photos
vivien
pulled
a
face
of
discouragement
we
got
enough
on
she
urged
leave
us
our
saturdays
we
need
have
them
on
saturdays
they
could
be
from
four
to
five
on
wednesdays
i
think
it
just
what
is
wanted
at
the
gables
day
girls
never
get
an
opportunity
of
meeting
and
comparing
notes
and
having
fun
together
like
girls
do
at
boarding
schools
it
would
be
a
sort
of
party
every
time
i
think
it
sounds
ripping
said
claire
stick
it
in
with
the
proposition
as
far
as
i
concerned
hands
up
for
the
amendment
then
five
hands
went
up
promptly
two
doubtfully
and
vivien
hands
remained
on
her
lap
not
that
she
really
objected
very
much
to
the
idea
of
socials
but
she
was
not
disposed
to
give
in
too
readily
to
all
her
cousin
suggestions
the
feeling
that
she
herself
ought
to
have
occupied
the
presidential
chair
still
rankled
carried
by
a
majority
however
the
new
scheme
became
law
and
the
committee
with
an
eye
on
the
clock
and
looming
near
hurriedly
settled
minor
details
appointed
wednesday
fortnight
for
the
first
social
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
powers
that
be
and
having
triumphantly
concluded
their
business
stamped
downstairs
with
more
noise
than
was
absolutely
consistent
with
the
dignity
of
monitresses
but
then
the
juniors
had
gone
home
and
were
not
there
to
hear
lorraine
highly
satisfied
with
the
results
of
the
meeting
was
determined
to
make
the
first
social
a
success
she
had
always
felt
strongly
that
there
was
not
a
sufficient
bond
of
union
among
the
girls
at
the
gables
she
remembered
her
own
days
as
a
junior
when
the
seniors
had
seemed
distant
and
unapproachable
beings
whose
doings
were
a
mystery
i
used
to
long
to
see
their
collections
and
drawings
and
things
she
ruminated
but
if
i
ever
tried
to
butt
in
i
got
a
jolly
good
snub
for
my
pains
it
going
to
be
different
now
those
youngsters
shall
have
a
chance
they
ca
learn
unless
we
show
them
how
i
do
call
it
sporting
for
the
sixth
to
do
good
work
and
hide
it
under
a
bushel
have
a
nice
jinky
little
exhibition
and
encourage
everybody
to
try
and
make
it
a
bigger
one
next
time
it
spur
the
juniors
on
to
see
some
of
our
attempts
i
put
the
screw
on
vivien
to
bring
her
butterflies
though
i
know
she
hates
moving
the
cases
miss
kingsley
heartily
approved
of
the
idea
of
the
social
gathering
and
smoothed
the
way
for
its
adoption
by
allowing
school
to
be
suspended
at
three
instead
of
four
on
those
special
wednesday
afternoons
she
promised
to
provide
tables
in
the
gymnasium
for
the
display
of
specimens
and
to
do
anything
else
in
her
power
to
help
matters
forward
it
will
give
you
a
splendid
opportunity
for
getting
to
know
the
younger
girls
she
assured
lorraine
i
very
glad
you
thought
of
it
determined
to
make
the
first
exhibition
as
representative
as
possible
its
enthusiastic
originator
divided
it
into
sections
and
put
up
notices
inviting
contributions
of
all
sorts
from
all
quarters
at
home
she
held
a
review
of
her
own
possible
exhibits
and
monica
and
shook
her
head
over
them
i
do
call
ourselves
a
really
clever
family
she
acknowledged
we
plod
along
in
our
own
way
but
we
do
blaze
out
into
leather
work
or
ribbon
embroidery
or
lace
what
about
my
fretwork
basket
for
rosemary
demanded
monica
rather
nettled
mervyn
made
the
best
half
of
it
and
it
was
crooked
at
that
returned
lorraine
frankly
i
should
have
cared
to
show
it
as
a
specimen
of
forrester
handicraft
i
do
think
any
of
our
efforts
are
much
of
a
credit
to
us
i
vote
you
and
i
go
in
for
natural
history
instead
make
a
collection
of
all
the
ferns
in
the
neighbourhood
bringing
pressed
flowers
and
vivien
her
butterflies
but
i
heard
of
anybody
taking
up
the
ferns
we
rummage
round
on
saturday
afternoon
and
get
all
the
kinds
we
can
and
plant
them
in
that
tin
dish
that
under
the
greenhouse
shelf
is
it
to
be
your
collection
or
mine
asked
monica
doubtfully
do
be
nasty
we
each
have
one
if
you
like
you
may
have
the
tin
for
yours
and
i
use
that
big
photographic
developing
dish
for
mine
will
that
content
you
you
spoilt
baby
right
oh
conceded
monica
magnanimously
but
if
i
do
any
more
fretwork
before
the
exhibition
i
going
to
show
it
it
be
as
nice
as
jill
or
greta
you
bet
having
decided
upon
a
representative
collection
of
ferns
as
their
de
for
the
social
gathering
the
next
and
most
important
step
was
to
get
the
specimens
armed
with
baskets
and
trowels
lorraine
and
monica
made
several
expeditions
into
the
country
lanes
and
came
home
burdened
with
spoils
to
identify
their
treasures
was
a
harder
task
lorraine
pored
over
the
illustrations
in
sowerby
and
got
horribly
mixed
between
lastrea
dilatata
and
athyrium
i
know
i
shall
put
all
the
names
wrong
she
declared
but
i
make
a
shot
at
them
anyway
if
you
want
ferns
said
mervyn
who
came
whistling
into
the
where
the
girls
were
sitting
i
know
a
place
where
there
are
just
heaps
and
heaps
of
them
all
sorts
and
kinds
oh
where
exclaimed
lorraine
and
monica
in
an
excited
duet
down
the
railway
cutting
they
all
growing
round
the
mouth
of
the
tunnel
i
seen
them
lots
of
times
but
i
never
took
any
notice
of
them
before
if
you
like
i
show
you
there
be
just
time
before
it
gets
dark
we
come
now
said
lorraine
running
to
fetch
hat
and
coat
a
mascot
mervyn
she
had
never
thought
of
the
railway
cutting
for
it
was
quite
in
the
town
and
seemed
a
most
unlikely
place
in
which
to
go
botanizing
they
walked
down
through
the
narrow
streets
by
the
harbour
then
up
the
steep
road
past
the
chapel
and
above
the
station
till
they
came
to
the
high
palings
that
overlooked
the
line
below
them
lay
the
entrance
to
the
tunnel
and
growing
in
the
crevices
of
the
stone
wall
on
either
side
of
the
archway
was
a
crop
of
ferns
luxuriant
enough
amply
to
justify
mervyn
enthusiastic
description
how
absolutely
topping
exclaimed
lorraine
scaling
the
palings
with
scant
consideration
for
her
skirt
and
less
for
her
fingers
shall
i
help
you
cuckoo
look
out
for
splinters
but
monica
long
legs
already
dangled
on
the
far
side
and
she
dropped
successfully
if
painfully
into
a
clump
of
thistles
and
followed
her
brother
down
the
bank
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
excellence
of
the
ferns
but
they
had
one
disadvantage
like
most
botanical
specimens
of
any
value
the
best
and
finest
grew
out
of
reach
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
climb
the
wall
they
had
all
three
mounted
up
some
distance
and
were
busily
pulling
at
roots
when
a
stern
voice
suddenly
sounded
in
their
ears
what
are
you
doing
up
there
get
down
at
once
lorraine
was
so
startled
that
she
lost
her
footing
and
descended
with
more
speed
than
elegance
tumbling
indeed
almost
into
the
arms
of
their
indignant
questioner
he
eyed
her
suspiciously
and
turned
to
mervyn
and
monica
who
had
come
down
with
greater
caution
now
you
three
got
to
give
an
account
of
yourselves
he
proclaimed
i
a
special
constable
and
i
want
to
know
what
you
doing
on
the
railway
line
at
the
mouth
of
a
tunnel
we
were
doing
no
harm
answered
mervyn
only
getting
a
few
ferns
oh
i
dare
say
and
what
else
this
is
a
military
area
and
trespassing
on
the
railway
line
and
especially
loitering
in
the
vicinity
of
a
tunnel
comes
under
the
heading
of
an
offence
against
the
realm
i
shall
have
to
report
it
give
me
your
names
and
addresses
the
three
young
forresters
looked
at
one
another
in
dismay
this
is
absurd
burst
out
lorraine
we
came
to
get
a
few
ferns
that
all
they
wild
and
surely
taking
a
root
or
two
is
an
offence
against
the
realm
you
been
found
in
a
forbidden
area
in
a
military
zone
returned
the
special
constable
pompously
i
stationed
here
to
guard
the
tunnel
and
i
shall
report
you
if
you
do
give
me
your
names
and
addresses
i
shall
have
to
arrest
you
very
unwillingly
the
forresters
complied
and
watched
the
incriminating
details
being
jotted
down
in
an
official
notebook
our
father
is
a
town
councillor
ventured
lorraine
hoping
for
vicarious
favour
that
makes
it
so
much
the
worse
for
you
ought
to
know
better
was
the
uncompromising
reply
take
yourselves
off
at
once
and
mind
you
never
come
trespassing
here
again
crestfallen
but
trying
to
preserve
the
family
dignity
the
forresters
beat
a
retreat
they
scorned
to
run
and
walked
leisurely
up
the
bank
while
the
special
constable
covered
them
with
his
eye
monica
had
an
uneasy
suspicion
that
they
might
also
be
covered
with
a
revolver
and
though
she
would
not
for
worlds
have
shown
a
qualm
of
fear
before
mervyn
she
was
nevertheless
considerably
relieved
when
she
found
herself
upon
the
safe
side
of
the
fence
strafe
the
old
chap
and
his
exploded
mervyn
a
nice
mess
he
got
us
into
with
his
fussy
interference
do
you
think
he
really
report
us
asked
lorraine
anxiously
her
spirits
were
down
at
zero
her
father
was
strict
and
would
be
very
angry
with
them
for
getting
into
trouble
a
scene
at
home
loomed
large
on
the
horizon
in
imagination
she
saw
the
affair
reported
in
the
local
newspaper
a
nice
position
truly
for
the
head
girl
at
the
gables
to
begin
the
new
term
by
covering
herself
with
disgrace
mervyn
strode
along
whistling
with
amused
but
inwardly
absorbed
in
unpleasant
contemplation
monica
clutched
the
fern
basket
rounding
a
corner
suddenly
they
nearly
collided
with
a
thin
little
gentleman
who
was
coming
uphill
at
top
speed
so
sorry
apologized
lorraine
why
it
uncle
barton
where
are
you
going
uncle
on
special
constable
duty
worse
luck
for
it
a
damp
evening
and
i
a
bad
cold
in
the
head
he
replied
but
i
got
to
relieve
somebody
else
an
inspiration
struck
lorraine
are
you
going
to
the
railway
cutting
oh
uncle
we
just
had
such
a
hullabaloo
down
there
could
you
possibly
help
us
out
of
it
barton
forrester
listened
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
to
his
graphic
account
of
their
adventure
and
promised
his
moral
support
it
on
duty
there
he
commented
i
know
him
so
do
my
best
to
convince
him
that
none
of
you
are
german
spies
or
dangerous
incendiaries
cheer
up
they
wo
hale
you
off
to
prison
this
time
i
expect
i
can
put
matters
straight
and
you
hear
no
more
about
it
but
remember
the
railway
is
taboo
for
the
future
we
ca
allow
even
botanists
to
be
straying
about
near
tunnels
in
a
military
zone
we
wo
so
much
as
lean
over
the
palings
thanks
most
immensely
uncle
you
an
absolute
angel
i
wish
i
had
wings
to
waft
me
up
the
hill
i
deficient
in
leg
power
coughed
barton
forrester
no
i
wo
kiss
you
monica
you
catch
my
cold
all
three
of
you
i
have
a
talk
with
and
persuade
him
to
wipe
off
that
black
score
against
your
names
i
always
said
uncle
barton
was
a
trump
murmured
monica
as
the
three
sinners
vastly
relieved
went
on
their
way
he
an
absolute
sport
agreed
mervyn
with
enthusiasm
chapter
iv
greets
claudia
by
dint
of
urging
on
the
part
of
the
new
monitresses
the
school
made
a
special
effort
for
the
social
gathering
the
idea
of
an
exhibition
had
frightened
the
juniors
at
first
but
when
they
grew
used
to
it
it
appealed
to
them
they
were
rather
pleased
to
bring
specimens
of
their
best
drawings
photos
plasticine
models
or
other
pieces
of
handiwork
and
though
their
efforts
might
be
somewhat
crude
lorraine
on
the
first
occasion
rejected
nothing
thinking
that
comparison
with
better
work
was
the
surest
means
of
raising
the
standard
for
next
time
she
and
her
certainly
made
merry
in
private
over
vera
lopsided
plasticine
duck
opal
clarke
extraordinary
original
illustrations
and
the
in
jessie
lovell
but
they
kept
their
mirth
to
their
own
circle
and
allowed
no
hint
of
it
to
leak
into
the
lower
school
on
the
eventful
day
of
the
social
the
closing
bell
rang
at
instead
of
at
four
and
delighted
girls
promptly
put
away
their
books
closed
their
desks
and
trooped
into
the
gymnasium
the
monitresses
aided
and
abetted
by
miss
janet
had
spent
a
busy
but
successful
time
in
preparation
and
the
room
looked
quite
festive
flags
decorated
the
platforms
and
chinese
lanterns
were
suspended
from
the
beams
of
the
roof
round
the
wooden
walls
hung
a
show
of
sketches
drawings
maps
illuminations
and
photographs
fastened
up
with
tacks
and
drawing
pins
and
on
the
tables
was
spread
forth
quite
a
goodly
display
of
moths
butterflies
beetles
shells
pressed
wild
flowers
fretwork
pokerwork
and
needlework
all
specimens
were
labelled
with
their
owners
names
so
it
was
excitement
to
walk
round
and
compare
notes
lorraine
listening
critically
judged
the
mental
barometer
of
the
school
from
the
juniors
remarks
which
if
slangy
were
certainly
complimentary
peggie
you
paragon
what
a
perfectly
chubby
little
bag
i
have
made
it
if
i
tried
till
doomsday
i
should
jill
if
done
that
illumination
is
this
sketch
really
mabel
hold
me
up
i
feel
weak
wonders
will
never
cease
here
old
florrie
made
a
collection
of
shells
i
think
this
show
is
a
stunt
absolutely
topping
keep
out
of
my
way
you
i
ca
see
all
right
old
thing
do
get
raggy
when
the
exhibits
had
been
duly
admired
and
notes
compared
as
to
their
respective
merits
a
few
of
the
best
musical
stars
performed
on
the
piano
then
some
round
games
were
played
and
the
proceedings
closed
by
the
whole
school
forming
a
wide
circle
and
singing
auld
lang
syne
in
the
orthodox
fashion
with
crossed
hands
the
girls
went
unwillingly
and
would
have
stayed
for
another
if
miss
janet
had
not
insisted
upon
their
departure
lorraine
putting
on
her
boots
in
the
decided
that
her
first
effort
had
been
an
unqualified
success
it
had
certainly
seemed
to
draw
the
school
together
in
a
bond
of
union
so
far
as
she
could
judge
she
could
not
resist
a
purr
of
satisfaction
to
dorothy
whose
coat
hung
next
to
hers
dorothy
congratulations
were
however
i
suppose
they
enjoyed
it
she
admitted
grudgingly
though
i
dare
say
some
of
them
felt
it
a
bore
to
be
obliged
to
stay
after
four
vivien
said
you
got
the
whole
thing
up
to
show
off
your
own
specimens
the
hot
colour
flamed
to
lorraine
cheeks
oh
what
a
shame
i
i
hardly
showed
any
specimens
myself
only
a
few
ferns
and
photos
and
one
drawing
you
it
was
for
my
own
glorification
dorothy
straightened
her
collar
outside
her
coat
as
if
its
arrangement
were
the
main
object
in
life
oh
not
saying
so
she
remarked
carelessly
i
only
telling
you
what
i
heard
vivien
say
effie
swan
wondered
you
never
asked
to
play
when
you
asked
theresa
dawson
i
could
ask
them
all
it
was
a
concert
she
very
offended
though
i
do
think
she
going
to
come
to
the
next
social
let
her
stay
at
home
then
snapped
lorraine
thoroughly
exasperated
dorothy
consulted
her
watch
it
frightfully
late
she
sighed
i
sha
have
time
to
do
my
practising
we
going
out
to
a
concert
she
sauntered
away
having
lodged
several
very
unpleasant
shafts
and
leaving
them
to
rankle
for
lorraine
all
the
satisfaction
of
the
afternoon
had
faded
nothing
hurts
so
much
as
the
confidences
of
a
friend
who
tells
you
the
disagreeable
things
that
other
people
say
about
you
it
is
a
particularly
mean
form
of
sincerity
for
the
remarks
were
probably
never
intended
to
be
repeated
the
mischief
it
often
causes
is
incalculable
lorraine
walked
home
feeling
that
there
was
a
barrier
between
herself
and
her
cousin
i
knew
vivien
would
be
annoyed
at
my
being
head
girl
but
i
think
she
be
so
spiteful
as
that
she
ruminated
well
i
do
care
i
shall
go
on
with
the
all
the
same
and
with
any
other
schemes
that
crop
up
but
it
is
horrid
of
her
because
she
might
have
been
such
a
help
to
me
as
the
term
went
on
lorraine
began
to
see
only
too
clearly
that
her
two
great
obstacles
in
the
school
were
dorothy
and
vivien
they
did
not
openly
thwart
her
but
there
was
a
continual
undercurrent
of
opposition
not
marked
enough
for
comment
but
sufficiently
galling
no
matter
what
she
proposed
they
had
always
some
objection
to
offer
and
though
in
the
end
they
might
hold
up
their
hands
with
the
rest
it
was
with
an
air
of
concession
more
than
of
agreement
they
were
the
cleverest
girls
in
the
form
so
it
was
hard
to
have
to
count
them
as
opponents
rather
than
as
allies
in
her
work
the
other
members
of
the
sixth
who
had
passed
up
the
school
with
her
she
knew
from
experience
would
give
scant
help
patsie
was
a
audrey
an
amiable
little
goose
nellie
and
claire
were
very
stodgy
ordinary
girls
without
an
original
idea
between
them
and
not
much
notion
of
the
responsibilities
of
monitresses
i
want
somebody
to
back
me
up
and
act
as
lieutenant
thought
lorraine
it
was
at
this
juncture
that
she
discovered
the
capacities
of
claudia
she
had
so
far
taken
very
little
notice
of
the
newcomer
except
by
vaguely
appreciating
the
fact
of
her
extreme
prettiness
claudia
had
not
pushed
herself
and
the
intimacy
which
now
sprang
up
between
the
two
girls
came
of
a
mere
chance
miss
kingsley
had
asked
the
school
to
collect
and
nuts
to
be
sent
to
headquarters
for
use
in
the
manufacture
of
for
the
army
it
was
a
point
of
patriotism
for
everyone
to
bring
as
many
as
possible
lorraine
strolling
out
one
saturday
on
this
errand
did
not
find
it
an
easy
matter
to
fill
her
basket
the
appeal
was
a
universal
one
in
the
town
and
the
council
school
children
had
been
on
the
common
before
her
picking
up
the
and
acorns
as
for
there
seemed
not
a
solitary
one
left
in
the
hedges
she
was
wandering
disconsolately
along
foraging
with
small
success
when
she
happened
to
meet
claudia
lorraine
held
out
her
basket
for
sympathy
that
all
i
been
able
to
find
and
if
there
are
any
more
to
be
had
i
sure
i
do
know
where
they
are
there
are
heaps
of
in
the
fields
above
our
house
replied
claudia
i
going
home
now
and
if
you
care
to
come
with
me
i
help
you
to
get
some
lorraine
jumped
at
the
offer
and
the
girls
set
off
together
up
the
road
chatting
briskly
the
castletons
had
only
come
lately
to
porthkeverne
castleton
was
an
artist
and
attracted
by
the
quaint
streets
picturesque
harbour
and
the
glorious
cliffs
and
sea
in
the
neighbourhood
he
had
taken
windy
howe
an
empty
farmhouse
on
a
hill
some
way
above
the
town
converting
a
big
barn
into
a
studio
and
establishing
himself
there
with
easels
and
a
huge
pile
of
immense
canvases
a
critic
had
once
described
castleton
as
a
genius
who
had
just
missed
fire
and
the
simile
was
an
apt
one
his
large
pictures
were
good
but
not
always
good
enough
to
hit
the
public
taste
he
was
constantly
changing
his
style
and
one
year
would
astonish
the
exhibitions
by
misty
impressionism
and
the
next
would
return
to
methods
he
had
dabbled
in
sculpture
illustration
frescoes
and
miniature
painting
and
had
published
two
volumes
of
minor
poems
which
unfortunately
had
never
commanded
a
good
sale
he
was
a
handsome
interesting
man
utterly
unpractical
and
irrational
delightful
to
talk
to
but
exasperating
in
the
extreme
to
those
with
whom
he
had
business
the
quaint
homestead
on
the
hill
with
its
bedrooms
panelled
parlours
kitchen
ivied
porch
thick
hedge
of
fuchsias
and
view
over
a
stretch
of
heath
and
the
dancing
waters
of
the
bay
satisfied
his
artistic
temperament
and
provided
a
suitable
background
for
the
new
ideas
which
he
was
constantly
evolving
moreover
though
this
was
quite
a
secondary
consideration
it
afforded
sufficient
accommodation
for
his
family
lorraine
first
impression
of
the
castletons
was
that
they
went
in
for
both
quality
and
quantity
they
numbered
nine
and
all
had
the
same
noses
cupid
mouths
irreproachable
complexions
neat
teeth
blue
eyes
and
shining
sunlit
hair
they
were
a
veritable
to
artists
and
their
portraits
had
been
painted
constantly
by
their
father
and
his
friends
pictures
of
them
in
various
costumes
and
poses
had
appeared
as
coloured
supplements
to
annuals
or
as
frontispieces
in
magazines
they
had
figured
in
the
academy
and
had
been
bought
for
permanent
collections
in
local
art
galleries
the
features
of
morland
claudia
landry
beata
romola
and
madox
had
for
years
been
familiar
to
frequenters
of
provincial
exhibitions
sometimes
singly
sometimes
in
groups
and
sometimes
with
the
lovely
mother
whose
profile
was
considered
a
near
approach
to
that
of
the
classic
statue
of
ceres
five
years
before
this
story
opens
pretty
impetuous
castleton
had
suddenly
resigned
all
the
sad
and
glad
things
that
make
up
the
puzzle
we
call
life
and
passed
on
to
sample
the
ways
of
a
wider
world
for
the
first
six
months
her
husband
had
mourned
for
her
distractedly
and
had
written
quite
a
little
volume
of
poems
in
her
memory
for
the
next
eight
months
he
was
attractively
pensive
and
then
all
in
a
few
weeks
he
fell
in
love
again
and
married
his
model
a
girl
of
barely
seventeen
with
a
beautiful
face
and
a
cockney
accent
in
the
following
few
years
three
more
little
castletons
constable
lilith
and
perugia
had
tumbled
into
this
planet
to
form
a
second
nursery
and
were
already
learning
to
sit
for
their
portraits
in
various
attractive
studio
poses
claudia
running
into
the
house
to
fetch
an
extra
basket
for
the
introduced
lorraine
to
a
few
members
of
the
family
who
happened
to
be
straying
about
showed
her
a
row
of
pictures
in
the
and
escorted
her
through
the
gap
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
into
the
fields
at
the
back
of
the
barn
sitting
on
the
farther
gate
whittling
a
stick
was
a
boy
of
seventeen
with
the
unmistakable
castleton
features
and
sunlit
hair
hallo
morland
cried
claudia
we
going
to
get
chestnuts
do
come
and
help
there
a
sport
this
is
lorraine
forrester
morland
would
no
doubt
have
performed
the
orthodox
ceremony
of
lifting
his
cap
but
being
bareheaded
he
grinned
and
shook
hands
instead
do
advise
you
to
eat
them
they
beastly
he
vouchsafed
we
not
going
to
they
for
the
soldiers
then
i
pity
the
poor
beggars
that
all
they
not
to
be
eaten
they
to
be
made
into
i
told
you
all
about
it
morland
declared
claudia
i
a
shocking
memory
he
demurred
but
whatever
they
for
help
you
get
some
here
give
me
this
to
carry
and
he
took
basket
and
hung
it
over
his
arm
there
were
plenty
of
chestnuts
lying
on
the
ground
under
the
trees
and
more
hanging
on
the
branches
which
could
be
dislodged
by
a
stone
the
young
people
spent
a
profitable
and
filled
their
handkerchiefs
as
well
as
their
baskets
i
shall
have
heaps
now
exulted
lorraine
you
two
are
trumps
to
have
helped
me
i
nothing
else
to
do
said
morland
would
violet
let
you
practise
asked
claudia
quickly
no
she
said
it
woke
up
perugia
claudia
shrugged
her
shoulders
eloquently
it
always
the
way
she
replied
are
you
fond
of
music
asked
lorraine
love
it
it
the
only
thing
i
care
about
i
play
all
day
and
night
if
violet
did
turn
me
out
she
locks
the
piano
sometimes
is
she
your
sister
morland
and
claudia
both
laughed
and
looked
at
each
other
and
the
latter
explained
no
she
our
stepmother
but
she
so
young
that
all
of
us
call
her
violet
she
not
such
a
bad
sort
on
the
whole
but
we
have
squalls
sometimes
do
we
morland
rather
nodded
the
boy
constable
and
lilith
used
to
sleep
through
anything
and
everything
added
claudia
but
perugia
a
fidgety
child
and
she
wakes
up
and
yells
when
she
hears
the
piano
i
play
the
violin
a
little
admitted
lorraine
modestly
i
wonder
if
you
two
would
come
down
some
day
and
try
a
few
things
over
with
me
nobody
to
play
my
accompaniments
since
rosemary
went
away
i
know
mother
would
be
pleased
to
see
you
we
just
love
it
you
bet
we
come
lorraine
pouring
out
the
account
of
her
adventures
when
she
reached
home
sought
confirmation
from
her
mother
for
the
invitation
she
had
given
to
the
young
castletons
they
the
fascinating
family
i
saw
them
all
as
claudia
was
taking
me
back
through
the
garden
i
think
each
one
more
perfectly
beautiful
than
the
others
they
absolutely
romantic
you
let
me
ask
morland
and
claudia
to
tea
wo
you
muvvie
i
will
in
this
case
because
i
know
something
of
castleton
from
the
lorrimers
but
you
must
go
giving
broadcast
invitations
again
without
consulting
me
first
i
wo
i
wo
you
a
darling
to
let
me
have
them
muvvie
i
so
thankful
you
not
our
stepmother
so
am
i
returned
forrester
humorously
i
find
my
own
family
quite
a
sufficient
handful
and
what
i
should
have
done
with
another
woman
in
addition
i
do
know
it
would
have
been
quite
too
big
a
burden
we
can
play
the
piano
here
said
lorraine
because
there
is
any
baby
to
wake
up
and
cry
if
there
were
you
have
to
reckon
with
me
for
i
should
let
it
be
disturbed
when
i
successfully
hushed
it
to
sleep
i
have
forgotten
my
own
struggles
with
you
and
richard
you
were
the
naughtiest
babies
of
the
whole
tribe
after
this
rather
unconventional
introduction
lorraine
attraction
to
the
castletons
ripened
fast
into
intimate
friendship
they
were
such
an
unusual
family
so
clever
and
interesting
yet
with
bohemian
ways
that
were
different
from
those
of
any
one
she
had
yet
known
in
the
case
of
morland
and
claudia
their
father
artistic
talent
had
cropped
out
in
the
form
of
music
claudia
cared
nothing
for
painting
but
was
just
beginning
to
discover
that
she
had
a
voice
morland
hopeless
as
far
as
school
work
was
concerned
had
learned
to
play
the
piano
almost
by
instinct
he
was
a
handsome
careless
boy
decidedly
weak
in
character
who
drifted
aimlessly
along
without
even
an
ambition
in
life
he
was
seventeen
and
a
half
and
for
nearly
a
year
had
been
lounging
about
at
home
doing
nothing
in
particular
spasmodically
his
father
would
realize
his
existence
and
say
i
must
really
do
something
with
morland
then
he
would
get
absorbed
in
a
fresh
picture
and
his
good
intentions
on
his
son
behalf
would
fade
to
vanishing
point
in
another
six
months
the
lad
would
be
liable
for
military
service
so
until
the
war
should
be
over
it
seemed
scarcely
worth
while
to
start
him
in
any
special
career
doing
nothing
however
is
a
bad
training
and
even
castleton
artistic
friends
not
prone
as
a
rule
to
proffer
good
advice
tendered
the
occasional
comment
that
morland
was
running
to
seed
morland
himself
was
perfectly
happy
if
he
was
left
alone
and
allowed
to
sit
and
improvise
at
the
piano
he
never
troubled
his
head
about
his
future
career
and
was
as
unconcerned
as
the
ravens
regarding
the
sources
of
food
and
raiment
he
played
lorraine
accompaniments
easily
at
sight
with
a
delicacy
of
touch
and
an
artistic
rendering
such
as
rosemary
had
never
put
into
them
it
inspired
lorraine
and
yet
half
humiliated
her
she
was
a
painstaking
but
not
a
very
clever
student
of
the
violin
no
touch
of
genius
ever
flowed
from
her
fingers
to
listen
to
morland
was
to
gain
a
glimpse
of
a
new
musical
world
in
which
he
flew
on
wings
and
she
stumbled
on
crutches
she
sighed
as
she
threw
down
her
violin
for
she
had
all
the
ambition
that
he
unfortunately
lacked
chapter
v
a
question
of
discipline
at
school
claudia
rapidly
became
one
of
lorraine
best
allies
she
made
no
undue
fuss
but
she
could
always
be
depended
upon
for
support
being
a
new
girl
she
was
more
ready
to
take
up
new
ways
than
were
the
other
monitresses
who
remembered
the
régime
of
lily
anderson
and
were
inclined
to
judge
everything
by
former
standards
the
chief
bone
of
contention
was
the
bar
between
seniors
and
juniors
hitherto
it
had
not
been
etiquette
for
the
upper
and
lower
school
to
mix
more
than
was
absolutely
necessary
the
elder
girls
had
held
themselves
aloof
and
even
in
the
too
numerous
guilds
and
societies
had
insisted
upon
senior
and
junior
branches
having
broken
the
ice
with
the
social
gathering
at
which
every
one
alike
showed
exhibits
lorraine
began
to
run
all
her
organizations
on
more
popular
lines
she
persuaded
a
few
volunteers
to
superintend
the
little
girls
games
she
set
aside
two
special
pages
for
their
efforts
in
the
manuscript
magazine
and
allowed
them
to
vote
for
their
own
captain
in
their
club
these
fresh
departures
did
not
pass
without
opposition
some
of
her
colleagues
hinted
broadly
that
lorraine
was
making
a
bid
for
popularity
monitresses
should
be
loyal
to
the
sixth
sniffed
vivien
we
want
to
mix
with
dick
tom
and
harry
do
you
laughed
patsie
who
never
could
resist
a
shot
at
vivien
i
should
have
thought
it
was
just
dick
tom
and
harry
you
wanted
to
mix
with
and
you
disgusted
because
it
only
maud
gertie
and
florrie
honestly
you
be
far
happier
in
a
boys
school
you
better
get
your
mother
to
send
you
to
one
there
such
a
thing
as
retorted
vivien
so
there
is
chuckled
patsie
she
chuckled
thoughtfully
for
vivien
remark
had
given
her
an
idea
she
confided
it
to
audrey
who
was
rather
a
chum
of
hers
i
a
little
fed
up
with
the
duchess
she
remarked
and
i
want
to
play
a
rag
on
her
i
play
a
rag
on
somebody
for
things
have
been
dull
lately
and
the
school
wants
livening
up
she
said
something
about
what
asked
audrey
vaguely
why
boys
and
girls
going
to
school
together
i
believe
they
do
it
in
america
and
at
just
two
or
three
places
in
england
i
going
to
pretend
that
miss
kingsley
taken
it
up
and
that
some
boys
are
coming
here
vivien
would
be
so
excited
oh
and
i
tell
you
what
patsie
eyes
danced
the
most
topping
notion
just
come
to
me
let
me
whisper
it
audrey
bent
a
wavy
brown
head
with
a
pale
pink
hair
ribbon
to
receive
the
communication
then
exploded
into
ripples
of
laughter
gracie
and
sybil
they
got
short
hair
she
hinnied
oh
it
will
be
an
absolute
stunt
the
confederates
did
not
publish
their
plans
beforehand
patsie
was
an
experienced
joker
and
knew
that
the
point
would
be
lost
if
any
hint
were
to
leak
out
it
was
noticeable
however
that
in
recreation
time
she
paraded
round
the
gymnasium
with
gracie
tatham
and
sybil
snow
two
tall
fifth
form
girls
the
fact
was
commented
upon
by
vivien
herself
another
of
patsie
sudden
friendships
she
remarked
she
generally
have
two
going
at
the
same
time
what
come
to
her
she
weighed
down
by
her
responsibility
as
a
monitress
and
is
trying
to
spread
culture
through
the
school
explained
audrey
with
a
grave
mouth
but
an
irrepressible
twinkle
in
her
eyes
culture
great
minerva
i
sorry
for
the
school
if
it
takes
patsie
as
a
model
vivien
like
most
of
us
was
a
mixture
of
faults
and
virtues
one
of
her
strong
points
was
punctuality
and
on
this
patsie
counted
she
was
nearly
always
one
of
the
first
to
enter
the
in
the
mornings
she
liked
to
look
over
her
lessons
and
set
her
books
in
order
on
the
following
thursday
she
turned
up
as
usual
at
about
a
quarter
to
nine
and
found
to
her
surprise
that
patsie
and
audrey
had
already
taken
off
their
hats
and
were
tidying
their
hair
in
front
of
the
mirror
here
wonders
will
never
cease
what
brought
you
out
so
early
dear
me
there
a
large
amount
of
titivating
going
on
is
all
that
for
miss
turner
benefit
patsie
deliberately
fluffed
out
her
hair
twisted
a
round
her
finger
and
readjusted
her
slide
before
she
answered
have
you
heard
the
news
she
said
abstractedly
pushing
aside
audrey
who
was
trying
to
edge
her
from
the
mirror
what
news
miss
kingsley
trying
a
new
venture
i
think
you
get
a
surprise
when
you
go
into
our
of
course
some
boys
schools
have
really
had
to
be
given
up
for
lack
of
masters
so
what
else
can
be
done
while
the
war
on
added
audrey
what
mean
i
wo
exactly
tell
you
but
i
can
give
you
a
hint
look
over
there
and
patsie
nodded
in
the
direction
of
the
window
hanging
on
hooks
were
two
boys
overcoats
and
caps
vivien
gazed
at
them
as
if
thunderstruck
not
she
gasped
i
do
know
what
you
call
it
said
audrey
but
i
think
it
will
be
rather
a
stunt
come
along
patsie
and
have
first
innings
as
the
chums
ran
from
the
room
vivien
hurriedly
buttoned
her
shoes
and
tore
after
them
where
are
they
she
asked
excitedly
catching
audrey
by
the
arm
what
are
their
names
i
do
know
any
more
than
yourself
yet
we
soon
find
out
volunteered
patsie
flinging
open
the
door
of
the
sixth
form
room
an
unusual
spectacle
certainly
greeted
them
unusual
at
any
rate
in
a
ladies
school
sitting
on
the
desks
with
their
backs
to
the
door
were
two
masculine
figures
engaged
in
the
pleasing
occupation
of
pelting
each
other
with
apparently
they
did
not
hear
the
girls
entrance
for
they
continued
their
conversation
rather
a
blossomy
stunt
to
be
here
great
judkins
yes
guess
we
make
things
hum
i
nuts
on
the
girls
hope
they
a
set
oh
right
enough
on
the
whole
but
old
chap
let
me
tell
you
one
her
name
vivien
here
to
prevent
awkward
revelations
vivien
interrupted
with
a
judicious
cough
the
long
legs
slid
from
the
desks
and
the
two
manly
voices
ejaculated
hallo
our
new
school
mates
how
d
do
charmed
to
meet
you
i
sure
quite
in
a
flutter
vivien
advanced
looked
gasped
and
spluttered
out
gracie
and
sybil
you
wretches
the
masculine
figures
unmindful
of
manners
collapsed
on
to
the
nearest
seats
and
sobbed
with
laughter
took
you
in
this
time
old
sport
do
we
make
killing
boys
i
believe
you
were
just
gone
on
us
both
oh
how
it
hurts
to
laugh
i
feel
weak
i
think
you
a
pair
of
idiots
retorted
vivien
i
do
see
anything
funny
in
it
do
though
cackled
patsie
oh
vivien
you
looked
so
interested
and
excited
it
gave
me
spasms
there
do
get
ratty
over
it
brace
up
it
was
a
jinky
joke
burbled
audrey
i
say
you
two
you
better
scoot
quick
and
do
some
lightning
changing
if
miss
janet
comes
in
there
be
squalls
she
not
quite
ready
yet
for
here
stick
on
your
waterproofs
again
there
bolt
before
you
caught
a
nice
monitress
are
patsie
sullivan
exploded
the
outraged
vivien
where
our
authority
to
go
to
i
should
like
to
know
if
you
and
audrey
put
fifth
form
girls
up
to
such
tricks
i
wonder
you
condescend
to
it
if
were
head
girl
i
can
tell
you
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
but
with
these
new
slack
ways
there
be
no
respect
for
us
left
the
school
going
to
the
dogs
in
my
opinion
patsie
and
audrey
beat
a
hurried
retreat
for
they
knew
that
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
justice
in
vivien
remarks
their
escapade
a
report
of
which
would
of
course
be
circulated
through
the
school
would
in
no
way
enhance
the
authority
of
the
sixth
they
hoped
lorraine
would
not
hear
about
it
though
it
seemed
inevitable
that
it
must
come
to
her
ears
as
a
matter
of
fact
lorraine
learnt
the
whole
story
before
she
had
taken
off
her
boots
she
made
little
comment
but
went
into
class
with
a
cloud
on
her
face
the
head
girl
was
going
through
the
difficult
experience
shared
by
all
who
are
suddenly
placed
in
authority
of
trying
to
hold
the
reins
so
as
to
satisfy
everybody
to
keep
slackers
up
to
the
mark
without
gaining
for
herself
the
unenviable
reputation
of
a
tartar
to
be
pleasant
with
the
juniors
without
loss
of
dignity
to
preserve
old
standards
while
adopting
new
ones
called
for
all
the
tact
she
possessed
she
often
felt
her
cousin
a
great
impediment
vivien
was
one
of
those
people
who
love
to
give
good
advice
and
to
say
what
they
would
do
in
certain
circumstances
urging
on
others
drastic
measures
which
they
would
probably
never
enforce
themselves
if
they
happened
to
be
in
authority
sometimes
however
the
objections
were
just
and
this
was
a
case
in
point
the
matter
floated
in
lorraine
mind
all
the
morning
as
a
kind
of
background
to
english
literature
and
mathematics
she
called
a
monitresses
meeting
for
four
that
very
day
when
afternoon
school
was
over
and
miss
janet
with
the
big
volume
of
milton
had
taken
her
departure
lorraine
assembled
her
committee
intercepting
patsie
and
audrey
who
were
trying
to
sneak
from
the
room
look
here
you
to
stop
she
assured
them
i
to
call
at
the
dressmaker
i
brought
my
bicycle
on
purpose
objected
audrey
then
the
dressmaker
will
have
to
wait
ten
minutes
and
i
due
at
the
dentist
declared
patsie
the
dentist
can
wait
too
it
most
important
for
us
all
to
be
at
this
meeting
i
ca
possibly
let
any
one
off
it
rather
sulkily
audrey
and
patsie
went
back
to
their
desks
possibly
they
might
have
rebelled
but
public
opinion
was
plainly
against
them
vivien
was
looking
virtuous
and
dorothy
made
some
pointed
remarks
about
duty
before
pleasure
if
you
think
going
to
the
dentist
and
having
that
horrible
drill
whirling
round
and
round
inside
your
tooth
is
a
pleasure
i
wish
go
instead
of
me
retorted
patsie
flinging
her
books
back
into
her
desk
and
banging
the
lid
hard
you
be
only
too
welcome
to
take
my
place
do
be
shrill
child
business
is
business
and
the
sooner
we
get
it
over
the
better
i
want
to
go
home
myself
i
wo
keep
you
all
more
than
a
few
minutes
interposed
lorraine
what
i
want
to
say
is
this
that
though
i
have
openly
rather
held
a
brief
for
the
juniors
in
some
ways
i
do
mean
our
authority
over
them
to
be
in
the
least
lessened
please
do
misunderstand
me
about
it
we
must
thoroughly
uphold
our
dignity
as
monitresses
turning
a
reproachful
eye
on
patsie
and
audrey
and
enforce
the
rules
as
much
as
ever
hear
hear
it
does
do
to
grow
slack
said
vivien
pointedly
we
certainly
not
going
to
grow
slack
i
put
it
to
every
monitress
to
make
it
a
point
of
honour
to
keep
up
discipline
there
must
be
no
truckling
even
with
fifth
form
girls
rules
are
rules
right
you
are
o
queen
we
be
a
regular
set
of
dragons
no
giving
in
on
our
part
those
juniors
have
been
trying
it
on
lately
they
the
limit
sometimes
well
i
glad
we
all
agreed
remarked
lorraine
whatever
happens
we
must
support
one
another
i
need
not
keep
you
any
longer
now
patsie
wants
to
get
away
to
her
dentist
ugh
i
do
feel
in
such
a
hurry
to
go
and
be
tortured
when
it
comes
to
the
point
shuddered
patsie
but
i
keen
on
the
dressmaker
she
making
me
the
sweetest
you
ever
saw
in
brown
velveteen
with
braid
trimming
purred
audrey
having
decided
to
keep
a
tight
hand
over
the
turbulent
juniors
the
monitresses
proceeded
to
live
up
to
their
resolution
they
inspected
the
sternly
repressed
giggling
and
talking
on
the
stairs
and
insisted
upon
an
orderly
queue
for
the
issue
of
library
books
even
patsie
turned
the
twinkle
in
her
eye
into
a
glance
of
reproof
the
lower
forms
who
had
certainly
been
trying
how
far
they
could
go
were
disposed
to
rebel
and
gave
trouble
on
one
or
two
occasions
but
the
slightest
attempt
at
mutiny
was
met
with
instant
firmness
do
let
them
master
you
for
a
minute
counselled
lorraine
if
anything
very
flagrant
happens
report
to
me
and
we
deal
with
it
in
committee
it
was
only
a
few
days
after
this
at
twenty
minutes
past
two
by
the
big
clock
in
the
hall
that
vivien
turned
into
the
sixth
form
room
where
most
of
her
were
assembled
her
cheeks
were
scarlet
and
her
eyes
flashed
sparks
i
been
having
a
row
with
those
wretched
kids
she
exploded
what
do
you
think
a
lot
of
them
were
doing
why
they
actually
gone
into
the
where
everything
had
been
placed
ready
for
senior
drill
and
were
racketing
about
with
the
clubs
and
the
second
they
saw
me
they
bolted
and
made
a
dash
through
the
far
door
and
out
into
the
garden
leaving
clubs
and
lying
just
anywhere
you
never
saw
such
a
mess
as
the
gym
was
in
i
had
to
send
effie
swan
and
theresa
dawson
to
put
things
in
order
again
then
i
went
round
to
the
and
asked
every
single
girl
if
she
had
been
in
the
gym
some
of
them
owned
up
quite
frankly
but
one
told
me
a
deliberate
lie
a
lie
good
gracious
are
you
perfectly
certain
absolutely
sure
could
be
mistaken
i
saw
her
myself
in
the
gym
she
was
the
very
last
to
run
out
the
mean
little
sneak
lying
is
the
absolute
limit
frowned
lorraine
we
ca
stand
that
kind
of
thing
we
shall
just
have
to
make
an
example
of
her
which
kiddie
was
it
i
frightfully
sorry
to
have
to
say
it
but
it
was
monica
there
was
dead
silence
for
a
moment
lorraine
face
was
grim
are
you
perfectly
sure
vivien
asked
claudia
if
you
saw
her
there
no
more
to
be
said
declared
lorraine
emphatically
monica
must
report
herself
here
after
four
and
we
deal
with
the
case
as
it
deserves
nellie
will
you
please
take
her
this
message
rapidly
scribbling
the
summons
on
a
piece
of
and
tell
her
she
to
come
before
going
to
the
dorothy
would
you
mind
fetching
me
the
guilds
register
going
to
cross
off
monica
name
we
ca
have
a
liar
in
any
of
the
societies
oh
lorraine
stop
do
condemn
her
unheard
pleaded
claudia
she
may
have
some
excuse
to
offer
qui
returned
lorraine
bitterly
i
afraid
only
too
plain
but
let
me
try
to
find
out
do
be
in
such
a
dreadful
hurry
wait
a
bit
what
the
use
of
waiting
it
had
better
be
done
now
and
lorraine
with
a
firm
hand
drew
a
thick
ink
line
through
the
name
of
monica
forrester
all
through
afternoon
school
lorraine
head
was
in
a
whirl
the
fact
that
monica
was
her
sister
made
her
the
more
ready
to
punish
her
severely
no
one
should
say
that
she
showed
favour
to
her
own
family
after
the
crusade
she
had
made
for
discipline
it
was
necessary
to
be
stern
and
yet
monica
she
could
not
credit
the
child
with
telling
a
lie
naughty
and
wilful
she
had
often
been
but
deceitful
and
untruthful
never
it
was
indeed
a
hard
blow
to
be
obliged
to
convict
her
of
such
sneaking
behaviour
yet
duty
was
duty
and
lorraine
set
her
teeth
just
before
four
claudia
asked
permission
from
the
mistress
to
leave
a
few
minutes
earlier
and
made
her
exit
while
patsie
was
collecting
the
essay
books
lorraine
looked
at
her
reproachfully
but
of
course
could
make
no
comment
before
miss
turner
directly
the
latter
had
taken
her
departure
there
came
a
timid
tap
at
the
door
and
monica
entered
a
little
figure
with
big
puzzled
eyes
you
sent
for
me
she
faltered
yes
i
did
send
for
you
replied
lorraine
grimly
i
want
to
ask
you
before
all
the
monitresses
whether
you
were
in
the
gym
this
afternoon
give
a
straight
answer
monica
i
told
vivien
i
was
do
you
stick
to
that
yes
but
vivien
saw
you
so
she
says
ca
believe
me
lorraine
monica
grey
eyes
were
fixed
full
on
her
sister
face
there
was
a
quiver
in
her
voice
lorraine
steeled
her
heart
and
looked
away
the
word
of
a
monitress
is
sufficient
i
have
been
obliged
to
strike
your
name
off
the
guilds
register
monica
for
this
term
at
any
rate
you
wo
have
the
privilege
of
belonging
to
any
of
the
societies
i
want
you
juniors
to
understand
once
and
for
all
that
you
ca
break
rules
and
tell
untruths
if
you
only
confess
illustration
lorraine
i
ca
confess
what
i
not
done
but
it
been
proved
against
you
so
it
no
use
persisting
in
denying
it
i
stop
a
moment
lorraine
cried
claudia
bursting
suddenly
into
the
room
it
quite
a
mistake
it
was
monica
after
all
i
ran
downstairs
and
caught
those
juniors
as
they
came
out
i
watched
their
backs
and
irene
holt
has
just
the
same
blue
serge
and
buttons
as
monica
and
the
same
coloured
hair
ribbon
they
are
alike
in
front
but
their
back
views
are
absolute
twins
i
took
irene
by
the
shoulders
and
told
her
i
she
was
guilty
and
letting
the
blame
fall
on
monica
and
she
threw
up
the
sponge
at
once
literally
howled
and
acknowledged
it
was
she
who
had
been
in
the
gym
i
told
her
to
go
and
wait
in
her
own
form
room
and
she
sitting
there
for
all
she
worth
irene
the
little
sneak
i
awfully
sorry
monica
apologized
vivien
lorraine
face
cleared
like
sunlight
bursting
through
a
cloud
her
relief
at
the
turn
events
had
taken
was
intense
shall
i
bring
up
the
wretched
kid
asked
claudia
oh
do
please
forgive
her
pleaded
monica
she
such
a
scared
rabbit
she
never
knows
what
she
saying
well
i
call
that
sporting
of
you
said
vivien
smacking
monica
heartily
on
the
back
i
vote
we
just
say
no
more
about
the
whole
business
let
irene
scoot
off
and
mop
her
eyes
at
home
she
been
punished
enough
i
dare
say
right
you
are
agreed
the
others
readily
i
tell
her
she
may
go
then
said
claudia
lorraine
for
sake
take
a
penknife
and
scratch
out
that
score
you
made
through
monica
name
in
the
guilds
register
i
told
you
to
wait
but
you
were
in
such
a
precious
hurry
to
execute
vengeance
i
be
only
too
glad
to
restore
the
honour
of
the
family
smiled
lorraine
chapter
vi
the
grotto
to
make
amends
to
monica
for
having
doubted
her
word
lorraine
took
her
on
saturday
afternoon
to
see
the
castletons
they
found
all
the
younger
members
of
that
interesting
family
amusing
themselves
in
the
garden
digging
their
war
plots
and
sweeping
up
dead
leaves
they
were
friendly
children
and
adopted
monica
immediately
by
the
end
of
ten
minutes
she
was
seated
on
the
dead
leaves
inside
the
nursing
perugia
with
madox
squatting
at
her
feet
beata
and
romola
chattering
one
on
each
side
while
lilith
and
constable
brought
dilapidated
toys
for
her
inspection
as
she
seemed
to
be
perfectly
happy
and
to
be
thoroughly
enjoying
herself
lorraine
suggested
leaving
her
there
for
a
while
i
thought
perhaps
you
like
to
come
and
walk
with
me
she
said
to
claudia
i
love
it
above
everything
may
morland
and
landry
go
too
why
of
course
if
they
care
to
you
wo
mind
landry
claudia
hesitated
and
blushed
rosy
pink
you
know
he
not
quite
the
same
as
other
boys
you
must
expect
too
much
from
him
but
he
very
affectionate
and
he
likes
to
come
with
us
oh
please
bring
him
i
quite
understand
lorraine
had
indeed
seen
at
once
without
any
explanation
from
claudia
that
poor
landry
in
spite
of
his
fourteen
years
was
more
childish
than
madox
he
was
a
fine
boy
in
features
perhaps
the
most
beautiful
of
all
the
handsome
family
with
china
blue
eyes
and
pale
gold
hair
that
curled
from
the
roots
and
a
mouth
that
would
have
done
credit
to
one
of
botticelli
cherubs
in
mind
however
landry
had
never
advanced
beyond
the
age
of
seven
he
was
quiet
and
inoffensive
spoke
little
and
seemed
to
live
in
a
sort
of
dream
world
of
his
own
he
was
devoted
to
claudia
and
quite
happy
and
contented
if
he
might
follow
her
about
and
be
near
her
with
the
rest
of
the
family
and
especially
with
his
stepmother
he
was
sometimes
fractious
but
claudia
could
always
manage
him
and
calm
him
down
her
invariable
kindness
to
him
was
one
of
the
nicest
features
in
her
character
he
clung
to
her
arm
now
as
the
four
young
people
set
off
across
the
moor
he
been
having
rather
a
with
violet
explained
claudia
it
your
own
fault
this
time
landry
you
know
still
it
just
as
well
to
take
a
walk
and
let
the
atmosphere
clear
before
we
come
back
violet
easily
fizzes
over
but
she
does
keep
it
up
long
where
shall
we
go
lorraine
you
know
the
walks
here
better
than
we
do
suppose
we
go
past
pettington
church
and
along
the
cliffs
to
tangy
point
right
you
are
anything
you
like
will
suit
us
agreed
morland
easily
so
they
turned
through
the
farmyard
and
down
the
steep
lane
that
led
to
the
small
church
whose
square
grey
tower
and
carved
norman
doorway
looked
out
across
the
green
to
the
sea
father
was
sketching
here
yesterday
volunteered
claudia
pausing
to
peep
in
at
the
gateway
what
was
he
painting
asked
lorraine
stopping
also
to
look
and
admire
for
the
mellow
october
sunshine
glinting
on
the
grey
walls
and
the
trees
and
the
gleaming
sea
made
a
picture
all
in
russet
and
pearl
it
one
of
a
series
of
illustrations
for
matthew
arnold
poem
forsaken
merman
you
know
it
do
you
well
this
is
little
grey
church
on
the
windy
hill
where
margaret
came
to
say
her
prayers
you
remember
she
left
her
merman
husband
and
her
children
in
clear
green
sea
because
will
be
easter
time
in
the
world
ah
me
and
i
lose
my
poor
soul
merman
here
with
thee
she
promised
to
come
back
to
them
all
but
she
never
came
so
they
went
to
look
for
her
the
church
came
a
murmur
of
folk
at
their
prayers
but
we
stood
without
in
the
airs
we
climbed
on
the
graves
on
the
stones
worn
with
rains
and
we
gazed
up
the
aisle
through
the
small
leaded
panes
she
sate
by
the
pillar
we
saw
her
clear
hist
come
quick
we
are
here
that
the
part
daddy
drawing
just
where
they
peeping
in
through
the
windows
he
sketched
lilith
this
morning
for
the
youngest
mermaiden
he
given
her
a
little
fish
tail
and
she
looks
such
a
darling
and
beata
and
romola
are
bigger
ones
leaning
on
a
gravestone
with
their
arms
round
each
other
neck
and
garlands
of
shells
in
their
hair
and
constable
is
holding
up
a
great
trail
of
father
going
to
draw
me
as
margaret
for
one
illustration
i
to
be
sitting
at
my
wheel
the
humming
town
he
just
bought
a
ducky
little
on
purpose
what
fun
to
be
put
in
a
picture
no
it
is
we
all
think
it
a
horrid
nuisance
to
have
to
be
models
and
sit
still
for
hours
just
when
we
want
to
do
something
else
but
you
like
the
merman
picture
especially
lilith
she
really
sweet
you
seen
the
mermaid
carved
on
the
chancel
bench
inside
asked
lorraine
no
i
have
i
not
been
to
the
church
on
i
go
sometimes
jacques
lets
me
practise
on
the
organ
said
morland
but
i
never
noticed
any
mermaid
there
oh
come
in
and
look
at
her
then
she
worth
seeing
the
church
was
open
so
they
stepped
from
the
sunshine
outside
into
the
soft
diffused
golden
light
glowing
on
sandstone
pillars
roof
and
windows
it
was
newly
decorated
for
harvest
festival
great
clumps
of
michaelmas
daisies
hid
the
font
scarlet
bryony
berries
trailed
from
the
lectern
and
chrysanthemums
screened
the
pulpit
the
air
was
sweet
with
the
scent
of
flowers
lorraine
led
the
way
to
the
chancel
and
moving
aside
some
torch
lilies
disclosed
to
view
the
end
of
a
where
on
the
ancient
black
oak
was
roughly
carved
the
figure
of
a
mermaid
with
comb
and
glass
in
hand
there
a
story
about
her
said
lorraine
there
was
a
young
fisherman
who
sang
in
the
choir
he
had
such
a
lovely
voice
that
it
was
more
beautiful
even
than
her
own
and
she
fell
in
love
with
him
she
used
to
come
on
sunday
evenings
and
sit
outside
the
church
to
listen
to
him
singing
then
one
day
when
he
was
out
in
his
boat
she
rose
up
from
the
waves
and
beckoned
to
him
he
rowed
close
to
her
and
she
suddenly
clasped
him
in
her
arms
and
carried
him
down
into
the
sea
he
was
never
seen
again
and
the
villagers
carved
the
picture
of
the
mermaid
in
the
church
to
remind
people
of
what
had
happened
what
a
most
amazing
story
i
must
tell
daddy
perhaps
he
like
to
draw
that
too
said
claudia
by
the
by
where
landry
looking
round
anxiously
after
her
charge
he
all
right
morland
assured
her
he
gone
up
those
dusty
stairs
into
a
little
musty
cobwebby
gallery
he
always
goes
and
sits
there
while
i
practising
the
organ
ca
think
why
he
should
like
it
but
he
does
do
any
harm
so
i
let
him
look
you
can
see
him
morland
pointed
upwards
where
at
the
west
end
of
the
church
ran
a
small
gallery
over
its
carved
oak
balustrade
leaned
landry
like
a
cherub
on
a
jacobean
monument
the
sunlight
glinting
through
the
window
above
turned
his
golden
curls
into
a
halo
he
waiting
for
me
to
play
continued
morland
oh
do
cried
lorraine
the
organ
was
unlocked
so
morland
seated
himself
and
began
to
improvise
slow
dreamy
haunting
music
that
rose
and
fell
through
the
little
church
like
the
murmur
of
the
sea
whatever
faults
of
character
the
boy
might
have
his
face
was
rapt
when
he
played
and
to
lorraine
it
seemed
as
if
the
very
saints
and
angels
in
the
windows
were
looking
and
listening
landry
sat
with
parted
lips
and
blue
eyes
he
always
quiet
when
morland
is
playing
whispered
claudia
he
loves
music
i
wish
we
could
teach
him
i
tried
but
it
absolutely
hopeless
he
sit
there
all
the
afternoon
and
i
verily
believe
morland
would
too
once
he
started
on
that
organ
we
shall
have
to
stop
him
if
we
want
to
go
on
with
our
walk
morland
we
keeping
lorraine
waiting
morland
came
back
from
the
clouds
and
closed
the
organ
claudia
beckoned
landry
down
from
the
gallery
and
they
stepped
out
again
into
the
sunshine
and
the
fresh
salt
breeze
that
blew
up
from
the
shore
it
was
a
beautiful
path
to
tangy
point
all
along
the
edge
of
the
cliffs
with
great
rugged
rocks
below
and
the
sea
lapping
gently
on
the
shingle
gulls
flashed
white
wings
against
the
autumn
blue
of
the
sky
and
linnets
twittered
among
the
gorse
bushes
here
and
there
a
few
wild
flowers
lingered
and
claudia
picked
quite
a
bouquet
the
point
was
a
narrow
spit
of
land
crowned
with
a
cairn
and
here
the
young
people
climbed
to
get
the
view
over
the
western
sea
i
believe
all
here
under
the
water
is
the
lost
land
of
lyonesse
said
lorraine
in
king
arthur
days
it
was
a
prosperous
place
with
cornfields
and
villages
and
then
the
sea
came
and
swallowed
it
all
up
fishermen
say
there
a
castle
and
a
church
under
the
waves
still
and
that
sometimes
they
can
hear
the
bells
ringing
but
of
course
just
imagination
perhaps
the
mermaids
live
there
laughed
claudia
you
better
send
lilith
to
look
i
say
said
morland
there
a
sort
of
a
path
down
here
are
you
game
to
come
and
explore
of
course
we
are
it
will
be
topping
down
on
those
sands
leave
your
flowers
here
claudia
you
can
get
them
when
we
come
back
the
path
down
to
the
sands
was
a
scramble
but
not
particularly
difficult
for
agile
young
limbs
it
led
them
on
to
a
belt
of
rocks
where
little
fishes
were
darting
across
silvery
pools
and
small
crabs
were
scuttling
among
tangled
masses
of
sodden
and
spread
scarlet
tentacles
in
the
clear
water
the
cliff
rose
almost
sheer
above
with
gulls
and
puffins
and
guillemots
and
cormorants
perched
on
its
rugged
crags
or
rising
to
circle
screaming
in
the
air
looks
like
the
entrance
to
a
cave
over
there
said
morland
bet
you
six
cigarettes
to
six
chocolates
i
right
you
ought
to
bet
you
naughty
boy
returned
claudia
besides
we
ca
get
any
chocolates
nowadays
we
go
and
see
though
if
it
really
is
a
cave
i
love
exploring
to
reach
the
place
morland
had
pointed
out
they
were
obliged
to
struggle
through
jungles
of
brown
and
to
slip
down
little
precipices
slimy
with
green
and
to
scramble
over
rough
projecting
points
of
rock
into
queer
shapes
by
the
action
of
the
tide
a
jump
across
a
crevice
and
a
climb
up
a
few
feet
of
sheer
precipice
landed
them
at
the
entrance
of
the
cave
morland
scrambled
in
front
and
gave
a
hand
to
the
others
they
found
themselves
in
a
large
rounded
grotto
the
walls
of
which
shelved
gently
in
a
series
of
natural
ledges
the
floor
was
dry
and
covered
with
fine
silvery
sand
and
at
the
far
end
lay
a
pile
of
timber
washed
in
perhaps
from
some
wreck
by
an
abnormally
high
tide
the
afternoon
sun
shone
through
the
entrance
and
gleamed
on
little
bits
of
mica
and
spar
in
the
walls
making
them
glitter
like
diamonds
what
an
adorable
place
exclaimed
claudia
with
enthusiasm
topping
agreed
morland
a
regular
grotto
exulted
lorraine
and
landry
who
was
not
given
to
words
smiled
and
pulling
out
a
piece
of
timber
sat
down
upon
it
a
good
idea
said
lorraine
following
suit
look
here
i
just
had
a
brain
wave
let
appropriate
the
cave
and
call
it
ours
except
just
in
the
august
holidays
i
do
suppose
anybody
ever
comes
here
so
we
should
have
it
quite
to
ourselves
it
shall
be
a
real
grotto
we
get
shells
from
the
shore
and
make
lovely
patterns
with
them
all
along
those
ledges
and
hang
about
and
make
some
seats
with
those
pieces
of
wood
and
we
come
out
here
on
saturdays
sometimes
and
bring
our
lunch
what
votes
i
your
man
or
rather
your
merman
grinned
morland
any
good
recipe
for
growing
a
fish
tail
please
a
diet
of
whelks
and
winkles
not
welcome
for
my
digestion
delicate
it
a
chubby
idea
beamed
claudia
i
love
it
only
i
bargain
we
keep
it
to
ourselves
i
do
want
the
whole
tribe
trailing
after
us
every
time
we
come
the
little
ones
must
know
anything
about
it
sha
tell
them
you
bet
declared
morland
it
is
a
suitable
place
to
bring
children
agreed
lorraine
i
wo
say
anything
to
monica
or
even
to
mervyn
because
he
be
sure
to
blurt
it
out
to
her
it
shall
be
just
our
own
secret
i
expect
it
has
been
a
sort
of
secret
place
said
morland
those
ledges
look
literally
made
for
smugglers
no
doubt
they
kept
kegs
of
brandy
there
and
chests
of
tea
and
bales
of
silk
and
lace
in
the
good
old
days
why
should
we
keep
a
few
things
here
suggested
claudia
a
kettle
and
a
tin
of
cocoa
and
milk
and
some
matches
and
a
box
of
biscuits
then
we
could
light
a
fire
and
have
a
little
feast
any
time
when
we
came
a
ripping
notion
i
make
a
sort
of
cupboard
with
some
of
that
wood
to
keep
the
things
in
we
bring
cups
and
saucers
as
well
as
a
kettle
and
a
frying
pan
in
case
we
catch
flukes
down
in
the
pools
put
in
lorraine
eagerly
i
tell
you
what
i
do
said
morland
quite
roused
to
enthusiasm
i
come
over
on
monday
and
bring
a
saw
with
me
and
a
hammer
and
nails
and
see
what
i
can
knock
together
in
the
shape
of
a
cupboard
and
seats
then
next
saturday
we
tramp
over
and
have
our
picnic
splendiferous
we
have
to
come
in
the
morning
because
of
the
tide
right
you
are
i
guess
we
better
be
getting
back
now
i
have
grown
my
merman
tail
enough
yet
to
swim
with
and
i
no
wish
to
stop
here
all
night
morland
kept
his
word
and
went
on
monday
to
the
cave
armed
with
various
useful
tools
he
could
work
well
enough
at
anything
that
took
his
fancy
and
though
he
never
knocked
in
a
nail
at
home
he
toiled
here
in
a
way
that
would
have
amazed
his
family
if
they
could
have
seen
him
landry
went
also
and
helped
in
a
fashion
he
could
not
do
much
but
he
held
pieces
of
wood
steady
while
his
brother
hammered
and
he
collected
whole
pocketfuls
of
shells
from
the
beach
morland
whistled
cheerily
as
he
worked
he
wanted
to
give
the
girls
a
surprise
and
as
they
were
busy
at
school
all
the
week
he
had
the
field
to
himself
until
saturday
his
artistic
temperament
found
scope
in
the
decoration
of
the
cavern
fresh
ideas
kept
occurring
to
him
and
he
enjoyed
carrying
them
out
he
felt
like
a
kind
of
combination
of
robinson
crusoe
and
the
brotherhood
with
a
spice
of
poetry
running
through
it
all
next
saturday
lorraine
having
obtained
permission
from
her
mother
to
go
to
a
picnic
with
the
castletons
started
off
basket
in
hand
resisting
the
agonized
entreaties
of
monica
who
implored
to
be
allowed
to
accompany
her
sorry
i
ca
take
you
cuckoo
but
you
see
they
did
ask
you
only
me
beata
and
romola
are
going
either
but
why
should
we
go
and
madox
too
wailed
monica
the
spoilt
it
too
far
look
here
i
ask
mother
to
let
you
have
some
of
the
castleton
children
to
tea
one
day
would
that
content
you
ye
es
conceded
monica
doubtfully
but
it
does
make
up
for
this
morning
i
think
you
so
mean
lorraine
poor
old
cuckoo
but
you
know
you
could
really
have
come
in
any
case
for
you
to
be
at
the
dentist
by
eleven
strafe
the
old
dentist
i
wish
he
were
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
declared
the
youngest
of
the
forrester
family
with
temper
lorraine
ran
away
at
last
and
pelted
up
the
hill
to
the
house
meeting
morland
claudia
and
landry
in
the
lane
whither
they
had
fled
to
avoid
a
contingent
of
younger
ones
they
were
laden
with
a
cargo
of
miscellaneous
articles
a
kettle
a
pan
some
plates
and
various
tins
it
like
a
young
removal
said
claudia
or
emigrating
to
the
wilds
of
canada
laughed
lorraine
i
brought
an
enamelled
mug
because
it
does
break
like
a
teacup
and
a
little
old
britannia
metal
teapot
that
i
prigged
from
the
attic
it
was
only
going
to
be
sent
to
a
rummage
sale
so
we
may
just
as
well
have
it
do
mermaids
drink
tea
please
no
doubt
they
do
when
they
can
get
it
perhaps
the
smugglers
taught
them
how
morland
had
intended
to
give
the
girls
a
surprise
and
when
they
entered
the
grotto
their
amazement
quite
came
up
to
his
expectations
the
cave
seemed
truly
transformed
into
a
palace
landry
had
worked
untiringly
all
the
week
picking
up
shells
and
these
were
arranged
in
patterns
with
long
pieces
of
draped
artistically
here
and
there
fragments
of
wreckage
had
been
neatly
sawn
and
nailed
together
to
form
a
cupboard
a
table
and
some
seats
and
just
inside
the
entrance
in
white
pebbles
was
the
word
welcome
landry
in
his
own
way
as
pleased
as
his
brother
stood
beaming
morland
though
inwardly
proud
affected
nonchalance
could
make
it
look
much
of
course
he
apologized
much
why
it
topping
it
like
a
however
did
you
find
time
to
do
all
this
oh
i
just
worked
a
bit
murmured
morland
modestly
the
first
picnic
in
the
grotto
was
a
huge
success
to
be
sure
the
table
was
unsteady
and
had
a
decided
lop
to
one
end
and
the
benches
felt
slightly
insecure
but
the
girls
said
that
added
an
element
of
adventure
for
you
never
knew
when
you
might
be
suddenly
precipitated
on
to
the
floor
they
put
the
cocoa
biscuits
and
matches
in
tins
and
stowed
them
away
inside
the
new
cupboard
which
morland
had
placed
in
an
angle
of
the
rocky
shelf
then
fearing
that
the
rising
tide
would
cover
the
shore
below
and
cut
off
their
retreat
they
bade
a
regretful
farewell
to
all
their
arrangements
promising
themselves
the
pleasure
of
coming
often
again
it
seemed
too
early
to
go
straight
home
so
they
spent
the
afternoon
rambling
about
the
cliffs
watching
the
or
the
waves
that
were
dashing
below
time
flew
apace
and
when
they
came
down
the
hill
again
from
tangy
point
the
sky
was
golden
with
sunset
the
warm
evening
light
flooded
the
common
where
brown
bracken
grew
like
a
forest
and
goldfinches
flitted
about
among
a
grove
of
thistles
lorraine
who
had
an
eye
for
colour
picked
a
large
sheaf
of
yellow
ragwort
and
holding
it
over
her
shoulder
trudged
through
the
thistles
sending
showers
of
down
to
float
in
the
breeze
and
dispersing
the
goldfinches
from
their
feast
with
her
eyes
on
the
horizon
instead
of
on
the
ground
in
front
she
nearly
walked
into
an
easel
that
was
stationed
among
the
bracken
its
owner
sprang
up
to
save
it
and
lorraine
stopping
just
in
time
paused
with
her
russet
dress
and
flying
brown
hair
a
dark
mass
against
the
gold
of
the
sky
and
the
background
there
was
a
second
of
silence
as
a
pair
of
clear
hazel
eyes
grasped
the
picturesque
impression
and
registered
it
then
a
mellow
voice
murmured
kilmeny
chapter
vii
kilmeny
i
dreadfully
sorry

lorraine

all

pastel
now
i
been
going
in
for
tempera
how
are
the
babies
and
madox
he
a
special
friend
of
mine
i
brought
them
a
box
of
real
shortbread
from
edinburgh
yes
i
making
a
sketch
of
this
piece
of
the
common
it
appeals
to
me
in
the
sunset
what
a
charming
lady
is
she
whispered
lorraine
as
their
party
passed
on
she
an
artist
miss
lindsay
we
knew
her
in
london
and
it
was
she
who
advised
father
to
come
and
live
at
porthkeverne
i
glad
she
did
for
we
all
like
it
just
heaps
better
than
kensington
does
she
live
here
she
has
rooms
in
the
town
and
a
studio
down
by
the
harbour
but
she
goes
about
to
a
great
many
places
sketching
you
love
her
pictures
i
wish
i
could
see
them
perhaps
she
let
me
take
you
some
day
to
her
studio
oh
do
you
think
she
really
would
do
you
know
i
never
been
inside
a
studio
claudia
laughed
you
would
want
to
if
you
had
to
sit
as
a
model
as
often
as
i
have
would
she
morland
rather
not
as
a
family
i
reckon
we
fed
up
with
studios
returned
morland
thank
goodness
i
beyond
the
stage
of
beauty
madox
turn
for
that
do
congratulate
yourself
too
soon
i
heard
father
say
the
other
day
that
you
make
an
absolutely
perfect
study
for
galahad
and
that
violet
must
tell
lizzie
to
clean
that
suit
of
armour
for
he
meant
to
begin
it
as
soon
as
he
finished
oh
strafe
sir
galahad
groaned
morland
the
armour
the
most
beastly
uncomfortable
hot
stuff
to
wear
you
can
imagine
i
wish
i
had
a
nose
and
freckles
lorraine
living
in
a
modern
unromantic
house
in
the
residents
suburbs
of
porthkeverne
had
hitherto
had
little
or
no
acquaintance
with
the
artist
population
of
the
town
they
mostly
lived
in
the
old
quarter
and
had
studios
close
to
the
harbour
their
colony
being
centred
round
the
arts
club
in
the
guildhall
she
had
often
watched
them
painting
at
their
easels
in
the
narrow
picturesque
streets
and
had
longed
for
a
more
intimate
acquaintance
their
delightful
bohemian
way
of
life
had
a
fascination
for
her
she
sometimes
wished
her
father
were
an
artist
instead
of
a
lawyer
it
was
so
much
more
romantic
to
paint
pictures
than
to
make
people
wills
or
transfer
their
property
dad
utterly
practical
she
confided
to
claudia
he
busy
all
day
at
the
office
and
he
prides
himself
on
not
being
sentimental
about
as
artistic
as
that
cow
i
swop
dads
with
you
said
claudia
i
wish
mine
went
to
an
office
every
day
instead
of
to
his
studio
you
wo
forget
about
miss
lindsay
no
i
try
to
take
you
if
you
really
so
keen
about
going
claudia
was
as
good
as
her
word
and
one
day
came
to
school
armed
with
a
special
invitation
for
herself
and
lorraine
the
latter
much
excited
begged
permission
at
home
to
accept
i
think
she
lovely
mummie
miss
lindsay
i
mean
and
i
never
seen
a
studio
and
claudia
says
i
her
pictures
so
you
let
me
go
wo
you
if
it
wo
interfere
with
your
home
lessons
and
practising
extremely
kind
of
her
to
ask
you
i
sure
i
just
at
my
lessons
when
i
get
back
to
make
up
and
do
my
practising
before
breakfast
very
well
but
do
stay
later
than
five
the
evenings
are
beginning
to
get
dark
so
soon
now
oh
thanks
most
immensely
to
lorraine
brought
up
in
a
little
world
consisting
mostly
of
her
own
family
and
a
circle
of
cousins
it
was
really
quite
an
event
to
pay
this
visit
into
the
of
the
art
colony
she
came
to
school
in
her
best
dress
that
afternoon
with
the
chain
of
amber
beads
that
donald
had
sent
her
from
italy
they
were
at
present
the
only
artistic
things
she
possessed
and
therefore
the
most
suitable
for
the
occasion
she
and
claudia
hurried
away
as
speedily
as
possible
after
four
and
were
soon
tramping
down
the
hill
from
the
gables
and
treading
the
narrow
quaint
streets
that
led
towards
the
sea
the
harbour
at
porthkeverne
was
a
picturesque
place
that
had
figured
over
and
over
again
on
the
walls
of
the
academy
its
green
waters
this
afternoon
sheltered
a
fleet
of
whose
owners
were
busy
making
ready
to
put
out
into
the
bay
over
the
beach
and
round
about
the
breakwater
flew
hundreds
of
flapping
in
and
out
of
the
water
and
pecking
among
the
on
the
rocks
some
venturesome
urchins
scrambling
after
crabs
screamed
almost
as
lustily
as
the
gulls
along
the
quay
behind
the
barrels
and
upturned
boats
and
baskets
and
old
timber
was
a
row
of
irregular
buildings
that
had
once
served
as
sailmakers
warehouses
or
boat
builders
workshops
the
artistic
colony
had
joyfully
seized
upon
these
and
had
turned
them
from
their
original
use
into
a
set
of
studios
large
glass
windows
fronted
the
bay
and
twisting
flights
of
steps
and
painted
railings
led
up
to
the
doors
on
which
were
brass
plates
with
names
well
known
both
in
london
and
provincial
exhibitions
claudia
led
the
way
along
the
quay
crossing
the
gangway
where
the
little
river
flowed
down
and
passing
the
sailors
rest
where
a
few
old
salts
were
reading
the
newspapers
then
stopped
at
a
particular
flight
of
wooden
steps
that
were
painted
pale
up
these
she
ran
and
tapped
at
a
door
come
in
said
a
voice
and
the
girls
entered
to
lorraine
it
was
like
a
sudden
peep
into
fairyland
the
rough
wooden
walls
of
the
studio
had
been
covered
with
a
soft
brown
embossed
paper
that
served
as
a
background
for
sketches
framed
and
unframed
which
were
hung
there
pieces
of
tapestry
and
oriental
curtains
were
draped
between
and
large
plates
made
a
frieze
above
a
rare
walnut
cabinet
a
japanese
screen
a
table
some
chippendale
chairs
and
a
carved
oak
cupboard
composed
the
furniture
of
the
room
and
there
were
scattered
about
a
large
number
of
artistic
properties
bright
scarves
shells
beads
pottery
vases
pewter
and
standing
on
the
floor
a
huge
brass
jar
filled
with
branches
of
flaming
autumn
leaves
from
the
low
by
the
rose
miss
lindsay
a
fitting
centre
for
her
beautiful
surroundings
she
was
one
of
those
people
who
seem
neither
old
nor
young
for
her
intense
personality
quite
overmastered
any
ravages
time
might
have
made
in
her
appearance
the
passing
years
while
they
had
brought
a
grey
thread
or
two
among
the
brown
of
the
hair
had
mellowed
her
expression
and
the
shining
hazel
eyes
seemed
as
the
windows
of
a
soul
behind
noble
tender
and
full
of
sympathy
they
were
merry
eyes
too
and
they
danced
as
their
owner
welcomed
her
guests
i
been
expecting
you
and
the
kettle
boiling
sit
here
claudia
and
you
here
kilmeny
lorraine
is
her
name
never
mind
i
shall
call
her
what
i
like
i
hope
you
fond
of
potato
cake
and
shortbread
the
real
kind
from
edinburgh
you
rather
begin
with
plain
bread
and
butter
what
well
girls
seated
on
a
round
silk
by
the
cheery
wood
fire
drinking
tea
from
a
cup
covered
with
little
pink
roses
with
the
scent
of
late
carnations
wafted
from
a
vase
on
the
table
and
her
elbow
almost
touching
the
delicate
velvet
of
miss
lindsay
artistic
dress
lorraine
looked
round
the
studio
fascinated
she
thought
she
had
never
seen
such
a
delightful
place
it
appealed
intensely
to
her
romantic
side
and
with
its
bright
draperies
and
cosy
corners
seemed
like
the
opening
scene
of
a
novel
she
was
glad
that
the
tea
gave
her
some
excuse
for
silence
she
was
too
much
interested
in
gazing
about
to
find
words
for
conversation
their
hostess
wise
in
her
generation
left
her
to
herself
until
potato
cakes
and
scotch
shortbread
should
thaw
the
ice
and
loose
her
tongue
and
meantime
discussed
mutual
friends
with
claudia
we
must
waste
the
precious
daylight
if
you
really
want
to
see
my
pictures
she
said
after
a
while
come
to
the
window
and
sit
here
on
these
chairs
and
i
put
the
sketches
on
the
easel
they
are
a
series
i
doing
for
a
children
magazine
in
america
they
to
be
reproduced
in
colour
miss
lindsay
sketches
were
charming
and
full
of
a
quaint
fancy
they
were
rendered
in
a
medium
of
her
own
invention
a
combination
of
pencil
paint
and
crayon
which
gave
the
soft
effect
of
a
pastel
with
the
permanence
of
a
the
first
depicted
a
nurse
holding
by
the
hand
a
tiny
child
who
turned
with
wondering
eyes
to
look
at
delicate
little
fairies
which
the
person
evidently
did
not
see
in
another
a
little
boy
sat
in
the
forest
playing
with
elves
who
danced
among
the
bright
scarlet
toadstools
a
third
showed
a
brownie
in
a
nestling
by
the
side
of
a
baby
owl
and
a
fourth
the
pixies
sporting
under
a
starlit
sky
there
were
many
others
dainty
imaginative
and
ethereal
some
illustrating
poems
or
books
and
some
telling
their
own
story
all
painted
with
the
same
clever
touch
and
light
brilliant
colouring
these
are
my
favourites
so
i
shown
them
first
while
the
light
lasts
said
miss
lindsay
but
i
heaps
of
other
studies
landscapes
mostly
sketches
of
scotland
i
took
this
summer
i
go
on
putting
them
on
the
easel
and
when
you
really
bored
stiff
you
must
cry
mercy
and
i
stop
bored
said
lorraine
with
a
sigh
of
intense
satisfaction
too
lovely
for
anything
i
give
the
world
if
i
could
paint
like
that
so
they
looked
through
piles
of
fascinating
sketches
till
the
short
daylight
had
faded
and
the
logs
on
the
fire
began
to
throw
queer
shadows
round
the
studio
we
must
go
said
claudia
at
last
i
some
shopping
to
do
for
violet
on
my
way
back
and
she
be
raggy
if
i
do
turn
up
soon
i
rather
believe
the
things
are
wanted
for
supper
she
added
casually
then
you
must
hurry
smiled
miss
lindsay
who
was
well
acquainted
with
the
bohemian
ways
of
the
castleton
family
even
artists
do
like
to
be
kept
waiting
for
their
meals
however
absorbed
they
get
in
their
pictures
then
turning
to
lorraine
i
going
to
ask
you
to
do
something
for
me
kilmeny
will
you
come
to
the
common
with
me
one
day
this
week
at
sunset
in
the
same
brown
dress
you
wore
last
saturday
and
let
me
sketch
you
among
the
thistles
and
bracken
lorraine
flushed
with
pleasure
she
had
never
stood
as
model
in
her
life
and
though
the
experience
might
be
stale
and
wearisome
to
claudia
to
her
it
had
all
the
charm
of
novelty
of
course
i
will
would
you
like
me
to
come
she
murmured
delightedly
and
i
hope
you
do
mind
my
asking
but
i
like
to
know
why
you
call
me
because
you
kilmeny
do
you
know
the
poem
she
was
stolen
away
by
the
fairies
and
brought
up
in
the
place
that
george
macdonald
calls
the
back
of
the
north
then
seven
long
years
were
gone
and
fled
when
grief
was
forgotten
and
hope
was
dead
and
scarce
was
remembered
kilmeny
name
late
late
in
the
gloaming
kilmeny
home
came
well
you
see
i
going
to
paint
you
just
coming
home
in
the
evening
glow
with
the
yellow
light
behind
and
the
thistles
and
brown
bracken
the
sheaf
of
golden
ragwort
will
be
like
a
wand
and
you
still
have
the
spell
of
fairyland
in
your
face
i
not
sure
if
i
sha
put
in
a
few
fairies
escorting
you
back
they
blend
among
the
thistledown
i
can
see
it
all
in
my
mind
eye
if
i
can
only
manage
to
paint
it
you
be
sure
to
come
in
the
brown
dress
of
course
i
will
though
it
a
terribly
old
one
i
keep
for
scramble
walks
that
does
matter
in
the
least
it
the
colour
i
want
the
whole
scheme
was
a
harmony
in
brown
lorraine
went
twice
to
stand
for
miss
lindsay
on
the
common
and
several
times
afterwards
to
her
studio
to
be
sketched
with
more
detail
her
new
friend
made
three
or
four
separate
studies
for
the
picture
intending
to
work
from
them
afterwards
in
oils
i
sent
for
quite
a
canvas
she
said
and
i
going
to
try
one
or
two
experiments
i
not
often
pleased
with
my
own
work
but
i
like
these
studies
and
feel
inspired
to
do
a
three
by
kilmeny
i
believe
you
going
to
prove
my
mascot
when
lorraine
tried
to
analyse
afterwards
why
she
had
at
once
taken
such
an
extreme
liking
for
miss
lindsay
she
decided
that
the
attraction
lay
in
her
voice
on
some
sensitive
temperaments
the
quality
of
a
voice
has
as
much
effect
as
personal
beauty
a
rasping
sharp
fretful
or
uncompromising
tone
may
be
as
disagreeable
as
a
wrong
accent
but
the
harps
of
our
spirits
finely
and
delicately
strung
vibrate
and
thrill
to
kindly
cheerfully
spoken
words
the
friendship
between
the
two
progressed
apace
forrester
finding
that
lorraine
showed
such
a
suddenly
awakened
interest
in
art
arranged
for
her
to
take
a
course
of
painting
lessons
from
miss
lindsay
and
she
trotted
off
every
saturday
morning
to
the
studio
by
the
harbour
the
drawing
classes
at
the
gables
had
been
the
only
weak
spot
in
an
otherwise
excellent
scheme
of
education
so
lorraine
simply
revelled
in
her
new
lessons
she
had
genuine
talent
and
was
quick
in
catching
up
ideas
the
artistic
atmosphere
exactly
suited
her
so
far
she
had
lacked
inspiration
in
her
life
she
had
never
been
able
to
feel
the
enthusiasm
which
rosemary
threw
into
music
and
though
she
worked
steadily
at
school
the
prospect
of
college
dangled
sometimes
by
miss
kingsley
rather
repelled
than
tempted
her
she
had
drifted
aimlessly
along
without
any
specially
strong
tastes
or
ambitions
till
this
fresh
wonderful
fascinating
world
of
art
suddenly
rose
up
and
claimed
her
for
its
own
it
was
a
delirious
sensation
and
very
stimulating
she
could
sympathize
now
with
rosemary
keenness
for
the
college
of
music
perhaps
who
knew
some
day
she
might
prevail
on
father
to
let
her
go
away
to
london
and
study
painting
the
bigness
of
such
a
prospect
took
her
breath
away
there
could
not
have
been
a
better
pilot
in
these
untried
waters
than
margaret
lindsay
she
proved
a
veritable
fairy
godmother
not
in
painting
alone
but
in
other
matters
as
well
lorraine
had
reached
that
stage
of
girlhood
when
she
badly
needed
a
new
impulse
and
a
different
mental
atmosphere
it
is
so
difficult
sometimes
for
parents
to
realize
that
their
children
are
growing
up
and
require
treating
from
a
revised
standpoint
unconsciously
and
out
of
sheer
custom
they
rule
them
haut
en
and
then
wonder
why
the
little
confidences
of
the
budding
womanhood
are
given
instead
to
sisters
or
friends
though
she
was
old
enough
in
some
ways
in
others
miss
lindsay
was
that
most
delightful
of
persons
a
chronic
child
on
occasion
she
could
seem
as
young
as
or
even
younger
than
lorraine
and
enjoyed
herself
like
a
veritable
schoolgirl
the
two
had
royal
times
together
painting
in
the
studio
making
tea
by
the
wood
fire
rambling
on
the
cliffs
or
wandering
through
the
picturesque
fishermen
quarter
of
the
town
a
hitherto
almost
unexplored
territory
to
lorraine
under
her
leadership
she
began
to
take
up
various
side
branches
of
art
she
dabbled
in
gesso
relief
stamping
leather
embossing
stencilling
and
illuminating
new
visions
of
birthday
presents
dawned
on
her
horizon
and
she
intended
to
astonish
the
family
at
christmas
her
only
regret
was
the
very
scant
time
which
she
had
to
devote
to
these
delightful
occupations
her
position
as
head
girl
at
the
gables
permitted
no
slacking
in
the
way
of
lessons
and
her
mother
had
made
an
express
proviso
that
her
work
at
the
studio
must
not
be
allowed
to
interfere
with
her
school
preparation
lucky
you
wrote
lorraine
to
rosemary
you
able
to
spend
your
whole
day
over
the
thing
you
love
best
if
i

chapter
viii
vivien
makes
terms
george
forrester
and
barton
forrester
were
brothers
and
partners
in
the
firm
of
solicitors
deane
and
forrester
the
barton
forresters
lived
at
the
opposite
side
of
porthkeverne
on
the
road
to
cyr
in
an
red
brick
queen
anne
house
named
the
firs
with
a
greek
portico
and
iron
balconies
outside
the
windows
the
george
forresters
always
decided
that
the
house
was
the
exact
epitome
of
aunt
carrie
it
was
stately
and
stood
on
its
dignity
making
you
feel
that
it
had
a
position
to
keep
up
and
extended
hospitality
as
in
duty
bound
but
with
no
special
enthusiasm
houses
are
largely
a
reflection
of
their
owners
and
five
minutes
in
a
will
often
suffice
to
give
you
the
correct
mental
atmosphere
of
a
family
if
the
picturesque
general
disorder
of
windy
howe
suggested
art
run
riot
the
but
tasteless
precision
of
the
firs
expressed
a
totally
opposite
temperament
no
one
could
accuse
aunt
carrie
of
being
artistic
her
rooms
were
handsome
and
spotlessly
neat
but
they
gave
you
the
sense
of
being
furnished
not
arranged
and
their
lack
of
beauty
struck
a
chill
to
æsthetic
souls
aunt
carrie
herself
was
big
and
bustling
and
overbearing
with
features
a
high
colour
and
a
determined
voice
she
is
described
first
because
she
was
so
decidedly
the
head
of
the
family
uncle
barton
only
came
in
second
he
was
a
gentle
pleasant
little
man
with
kindly
wrinkles
round
his
eyes
and
a
habit
of
whistling
under
his
breath
when
things
grew
stormy
at
home
in
early
days
of
matrimony
he
made
a
struggle
for
his
own
way
but
abandoned
it
later
in
favour
of
a
policy
he
was
a
town
councillor
and
vicar
warden
at
the
parish
church
as
well
as
a
special
constable
in
his
spare
time
he
lived
for
golf
lindon
his
only
son
was
exactly
like
him
even
to
the
habit
of
whistling
and
the
propensity
for
golf
with
lindon
however
shells
at
the
present
were
doing
the
whistling
and
the
trenches
took
the
place
of
bunkers
his
photograph
in
khaki
stood
in
a
silver
frame
on
the
mantelpiece
the
three
girls
elsie
betty
and
vivien
were
shaded
varieties
of
their
mother
when
lorraine
counted
up
her
blessings
she
always
placed
rosemary
and
monica
as
special
items
she
did
not
get
on
with
her
cousins
i
like
uncle
barton
and
lindon
she
decided
you
never
hear
them
say
a
nasty
thing
about
anybody
it
the
girls
who
pick
holes
in
everyone
and
everything
the
attitude
of
the
female
portion
of
the
family
at
the
firs
was
fiercely
critical
it
might
be
amusing
to
themselves
but
it
was
uncomfortable
for
other
people
lorraine
visiting
there
in
a
new
dress
literally
squirmed
when
she
felt
eyes
of
inspection
directed
upon
it
it
was
the
same
with
accomplishments
both
she
and
rosemary
dreaded
to
play
or
sing
at
the
firs
the
chilly
thank
you
at
the
end
of
the
performance
hurt
more
than
brickbats
the
barton
forresters
were
always
urging
on
the
george
forresters
they
started
on
the
assumption
that
as
a
family
they
were
more
clever
capable
and
and
therefore
in
a
position
to
give
good
advice
elsie
recently
engaged
to
a
naval
officer
considered
that
she
had
scored
over
rosemary
who
was
six
months
older
and
still
unappropriated
betty
rubbed
in
her
indispensable
work
at
the
red
cross
hospital
with
comments
on
those
slackers
who
shirked
giving
their
fair
share
of
help
vivien
sharp
tongue
was
lorraine
chief
thorn
in
the
flesh
at
the
gables
the
fact
that
vivien
was
her
cousin
made
things
extremely
difficult
for
lorraine
she
could
have
done
battle
royal
with
a
stranger
and
fought
things
out
in
the
lists
at
school
and
have
finished
with
them
but
to
quarrel
with
vivien
was
another
matter
it
meant
also
quarrelling
with
aunt
carrie
elsie
and
betty
who
would
take
affairs
to
the
tribunal
of
pendlehurst
and
raise
a
domestic
sandstorm
long
before
when
they
were
quite
children
the
two
girls
had
quarrelled
and
aunt
carrie
had
solemnly
and
quite
unjustifiably
complained
to
her
about
lorraine
conduct
lorraine
had
never
forgiven
her
father
for
not
taking
her
part
more
firmly
on
that
occasion
the
remembrance
of
the
ready
ear
he
had
lent
to
the
side
of
the
question
had
prevented
any
future
appeal
to
intervention
matters
with
vivien
went
on
in
a
species
of
guerrilla
warfare
as
head
girl
lorraine
had
of
course
the
whip
hand
at
the
gables
but
in
every
fresh
scheme
she
found
her
cousin
a
dead
weight
and
an
impediment
vivien
always
suggested
something
different
at
committee
meetings
she
invariably
started
an
opposition
to
every
resolution
nothing
could
be
carried
without
bickering
in
her
capacity
of
monitress
vivien
was
not
a
favourite
she
was
far
too
and
domineering
to
win
any
measure
of
popularity
among
the
juniors
surging
discontent
sometimes
broke
out
into
rebellion
it
is
a
delicate
task
for
a
general
whose
is
too
officious
lorraine
with
a
feeling
that
she
was
treading
on
eggs
brought
up
the
subject
of
discipline
at
the
next
committee
meeting
we
must
see
that
rules
are
kept
naturally
she
conceded
but
i
think
perhaps
lately
some
of
us
have
just
a
little
exceeded
our
authority
we
do
want
to
get
snubbed
by
miss
kingsley
and
told
to
mind
our
own
business
if
you
mean
me
retorted
vivien
i
wish
you
say
so
straight
out
and
have
done
with
it
i
hate
innuendoes
i
consider
that
the
kids
want
keeping
in
order
and
i
there
to
do
it
whether
they
like
it
or
whether
they
do
we
must
of
course
keep
order
but
if
we
can
do
it
pleasantly
it
makes
a
far
nicer
feeling
in
the
school
some
of
those
babes
will
do
anything
for
a
monitress
they
like
oh
it
all
very
well
to
go
about
fishing
for
popularity
like
some
people
we
know
i
suppose
you
mean
said
patsie
quickly
if
the
cap
fits
put
it
on
nellie
and
claire
began
to
giggle
at
the
prospect
of
a
spar
between
patsie
and
vivien
dorothy
was
fiddling
with
her
pencil
and
frowning
i
do
let
the
kiddies
take
liberties
with
me
she
vouchsafed
yet
they
escort
me
home
in
relays
every
day
a
monitress
ought
surely
to
be
said
audrey
plaintively
what
i
feel
is
that
we
ought
to
work
more
in
harmony
explained
lorraine
it
does
do
for
one
monitress
to
allow
a
thing
and
another
to
forbid
it
the
juniors
do
know
where
they
are
yes
we
ca
each
run
the
show
on
our
own
agreed
patsie
could
we
draw
up
a
sort
of
general
list
to
go
upon
a
well
i
mean
some
general
guiding
rules
it
quite
unnecessary
demurred
vivien
my
advice
is
to
keep
the
kids
in
their
places
and
there
be
no
more
bother
with
them
that
sloppy
sentimental
truckling
to
them
that
at
the
bottom
of
all
the
trouble
i
got
to
go
home
now
you
may
make
any
rules
you
like
but
i
sha
promise
to
keep
them
vivien
scraped
back
her
chair
and
clumped
noisily
from
the
room
leaving
the
majority
of
the
committee
indignant
they
consulted
together
and
by
general
consent
drew
up
a
short
code
for
the
use
of
monitresses
they
handed
a
copy
of
it
to
vivien
next
morning
she
glanced
at
it
casually
and
flung
it
into
the
basket
i
a
monitress
as
much
as
the
rest
of
you
she
remarked
and
i
have
my
authority
from
miss
kingsley
i
ca
see
that
i
answerable
to
anyone
else
among
the
juniors
vivien
reputation
was
not
pleasant
naturally
they
talked
over
the
monitresses
among
themselves
juniors
are
little
mortals
and
they
had
a
very
good
idea
of
how
matters
stood
vivien
loves
to
boss
said
nan
carson
she
wild
because
she
not
head
and
she
takes
it
out
of
us
in
exchange
i
do
see
why
she
should
order
us
about
so
she
not
a
mistress
no
only
a
monitress
it
not
fair
i
shall
tell
her
so
some
day
she
a
mean
old
thing
why
should
we
obey
her
so
matters
jogged
along
till
one
day
they
reached
a
crisis
vivien
happened
to
be
passing
the
door
of
form
ii
at
about
ten
minutes
to
nine
it
was
of
course
before
the
official
school
hour
and
miss
poole
had
not
yet
entered
to
take
the
some
of
the
children
were
getting
out
books
some
were
making
a
last
effort
to
learn
lessons
and
a
few
were
talking
laughing
and
throwing
paper
pellets
at
one
another
they
were
not
making
very
much
noise
and
most
monitresses
would
have
just
walked
past
the
door
and
taken
no
notice
not
so
vivien
she
bustled
in
and
commanded
order
marjorie
sit
down
connie
shut
your
desk
doris
stop
talking
effie
pick
up
those
pieces
of
paper
at
once
you
ought
all
to
be
quietly
in
your
places
it
only
ten
minutes
to
nine
grumbled
the
girls
i
do
care
what
time
it
is
if
you
here
at
eight
have
to
behave
yourselves
i
shall
come
in
again
in
a
few
minutes
and
if
any
girl
is
talking
i
shall
put
her
name
down
vivien
stalked
away
leaving
mutiny
behind
her
no
one
ever
told
us
before
that
we
were
to
talk
before
miss
poole
came
into
the
room
it
absurd
nonsense
talks
before
nine
you
bet
vivien
does
herself
i
not
going
to
sit
still
piped
effie
remember
vivien
coming
back
warned
marjorie
she
wo
come
back
for
a
few
minutes
grinned
effie
hopping
between
the
desks
and
i
do
care
if
she
does
either
i
not
afraid
of
vivien
she
may
jaw
away
as
much
as
she
likes
it
amuses
her
and
it
does
hurt
me
so
there
we
are
see
some
of
the
girls
sniggered
and
effie
encouraged
by
popular
approbation
waxed
more
reckless
still
she
danced
to
the
blackboard
seized
the
chalk
and
began
to
draw
here
vivien
portrait
she
announced
this
is
her
long
nose
and
this
is
her
mouth
and
this
is
her
hair
oh
it
like
her
chirruped
gracie
the
very
image
hinnied
doris
shut
up
effie
and
rub
it
off
you
silly
cockchafer
recommended
marjorie
giggling
in
spite
of
herself
no
no
i
have
finished
i
must
put
her
blouse
and
swanky
tie
wait
a
sec
cried
the
artist
drawing
in
those
details
and
adding
a
large
balloon
issuing
from
the
mouth
of
her
model
and
containing
the
words
no
talking
girls
you
be
caught
urged
marjorie
seizing
the
duster
to
clean
the
blackboard
effie
snatched
it
out
of
her
hand
all
right
grannie
half
a
sec
more
i
just
time
and
she
scrawled
hastily
over
the
top
of
the
portrait
this
is
old
vivien
the
last
half
second
was
the
undoing
of
effie
for
at
that
very
same
instant
the
monitress
reentered
the
room
effie
wiped
the
blackboard
with
frantic
speed
but
not
before
vivien
had
caught
a
clear
view
of
her
portrait
she
glared
first
at
effie
who
had
skipped
back
to
her
place
then
at
the
nine
other
conscious
faces
finally
she
announced
you
every
one
of
you
report
yourselves
to
me
at
four
this
afternoon
i
shall
expect
you
in
the
handicraft
room
and
you
each
bring
a
poetry
book
with
you
i
shall
stay
here
now
until
miss
poole
comes
i
not
going
to
have
this
form
a
the
mistress
entering
almost
immediately
looked
rather
astonished
to
see
vivien
standing
by
her
desk
her
enquiring
glance
asked
an
explanation
it
was
necessary
for
someone
to
come
in
here
and
keep
order
miss
poole
vouchsafed
vivien
the
mistress
turned
a
reproachful
eye
on
her
flock
i
thought
i
could
have
trusted
you
girls
i
sorry
to
hear
you
not
been
behaving
yourselves
the
form
focused
indignant
glances
at
vivien
but
dared
not
utter
a
protest
their
wrath
overflowed
however
at
the
earliest
opportunity
for
conversation
sneak
mean
thing
and
we
actually
got
to
report
ourselves
to
her
at
four
it
the
limit
though
the
juniors
might
rage
the
established
tradition
of
the
gables
compelled
them
to
comply
with
the
monitress
orders
they
grumbled
but
obeyed
directly
afternoon
school
was
over
ten
sullen
and
sulky
girls
presented
themselves
at
the
door
of
the
handicraft
room
this
was
situated
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
playground
and
was
in
fact
the
old
converted
into
a
sort
of
joiner
shop
the
school
in
relays
learned
here
and
carpentry
and
clay
modelling
and
any
other
crafts
which
made
too
much
mess
inside
the
form
rooms
or
the
gymnasium
vivien
was
busy
at
the
bench
planing
a
piece
of
wood
she
greeted
the
victims
grimly
if
you
ca
remember
to
behave
yourselves
in
school
you
have
to
have
something
to
remind
you
she
remarked
you
may
all
sit
down
there
have
you
brought
your
poetry
books
very
well
turn
to
page
sixteen
and
learn
the
first
three
verses
of
lochinvar
you
stay
here
till
you
know
them
as
a
matter
of
fact
vivien
was
entirely
exceeding
her
authority
miss
kingsley
had
never
given
the
monitresses
leave
to
keep
girls
in
or
give
them
punishment
lessons
such
privileges
belonged
to
mistresses
only
the
form
however
was
not
aware
of
this
and
supposed
that
she
had
received
instructions
from
they
took
their
places
like
martyrs
and
opened
their
poetry
books
outwardly
submissive
but
with
black
rebellion
raging
in
their
hearts
vivien
going
on
with
her
carpentering
kept
a
strict
eye
upon
them
and
said
hush
if
any
one
attempted
to
con
her
task
even
in
a
whisper
she
heard
each
child
recite
her
verses
separately
and
would
not
let
any
of
them
go
till
all
had
said
their
portions
perfectly
by
the
time
they
had
completely
finished
it
was
a
quarter
to
five
you
may
trot
home
now
if
you
like
allowed
the
monitress
and
just
let
this
be
a
lesson
to
you
for
the
future
go
in
order
and
close
the
door
after
you
the
martyrs
made
a
decent
exit
but
once
outside
they
stood
and
pulled
faces
at
the
closed
door
she
an
absolute
beast
it
abominable
to
keep
us
all
this
time
and
learning
hateful
poetry
and
we
had
done
anything
to
deserve
it
either
what
can
we
do
to
pay
her
out
i
know
said
effie
hush
she
held
up
a
warning
hand
and
ran
back
to
the
door
the
key
was
on
the
outside
in
the
lock
she
stood
and
listened
for
a
moment
then
turned
it
and
fled
across
the
playground
followed
by
the
rest
of
the
form
instead
of
going
home
however
they
stayed
in
the
giggling
over
their
achievement
if
she
so
fond
of
the
handicraft
room
she
may
stay
there
she
shall
just
be
kept
in
herself
to
see
what
it
feels
like
she
just
be
savage
serve
her
right
vivien
having
finished
to
her
satisfaction
the
particular
little
bit
of
carpentering
upon
which
she
had
been
engaged
put
away
her
tools
at
last
and
turned
to
leave
she
was
very
much
surprised
to
find
that
she
could
not
open
the
door
she
rattled
the
handle
thinking
it
had
stuck
then
she
suddenly
realized
that
it
was
locked
and
that
she
was
a
prisoner
she
hammered
till
her
knuckles
were
sore
and
shouted
but
nobody
came
it
struck
her
that
she
was
in
an
exceedingly
awkward
position
the
handicraft
room
was
some
little
distance
from
the
house
it
was
improbable
that
miss
kingsley
miss
janet
or
the
maids
would
hear
her
the
window
was
nailed
up
and
would
not
open
so
escape
that
way
was
impossible
had
those
wretched
juniors
locked
her
in
on
purpose
and
scooted
off
home
she
stamped
with
wrath
at
the
idea
yet
it
seemed
only
too
probable
if
so
would
she
have
to
spend
the
night
here
the
prospect
was
appalling
she
made
a
last
despairing
assault
on
the
door
to
her
immense
relief
a
voice
on
the
other
side
responded
it
was
a
deep
gruff
evidently
feigned
voice
and
it
said
hullo
there
hullo
let
me
out
shouted
vivien
no
thanks
you
better
where
you
are
let
me
out
i
tell
you
gently
gently
do
show
temper
vivien
seized
the
handle
again
and
rattled
lustily
but
with
no
effect
she
thought
she
heard
a
noise
like
suppressed
chuckling
you
unlock
this
door
and
let
me
out
if
we
do
will
you
promise
not
to
boss
so
hard
again
i
sha
promise
anything
of
the
sort
right
oh
the
little
wretches
surely
were
not
going
here
come
back
vivien
shouted
she
was
allowed
a
moment
or
two
for
reflection
then
the
gruff
voice
again
began
to
parley
will
you
promise
i
shall
do
my
duty
as
a
monitress
but
you
wo
it
all
right
rather
sulkily
honour
bright
and
no
bunkum
i
told
you
so
the
bottom
of
the
door
did
not
fit
closely
to
the
step
and
presently
through
this
small
aperture
the
key
was
pushed
there
was
a
sound
of
pelting
footsteps
by
the
time
vivien
had
managed
to
unlock
the
door
nobody
was
in
sight
she
had
the
wisdom
not
to
report
the
matter
at
she
knew
that
she
had
exceeded
her
authority
in
keeping
the
children
in
and
doubted
whether
miss
kingsley
would
back
her
up
it
was
too
humiliating
an
experience
to
relate
to
her
so
she
kept
it
to
herself
she
utterly
ignored
it
when
she
met
the
members
of
form
ii
next
morning
several
of
them
blushed
so
consciously
that
she
easily
guessed
who
had
been
the
ringleaders
but
she
judged
it
discreet
to
take
no
more
notice
the
sinners
giggling
over
the
joke
among
themselves
decided
that
they
were
now
quits
with
vivien
chapter
ix
white
elephants
it
was
patsie
stroke
of
genius
that
originated
the
white
elephant
sale
the
school
was
racking
its
brains
to
raise
a
little
money
for
the
prisoners
of
war
fund
and
had
swept
aside
as
impossible
such
schemes
as
a
bazaar
a
pound
day
or
boxes
lily
tried
it
on
last
term
and
it
was
no
go
said
vivien
make
the
kids
shell
out
well
they
only
kids
qualified
nellie
and
of
course
they
have
much
so
what
can
you
expect
we
must
aim
too
high
said
claire
if
we
plan
something
too
big
we
scare
them
and
they
wo
do
anything
at
all
say
their
mothers
object
and
all
the
rest
of
the
usual
excuses
well
everyone
rather
fed
up
with
appeals
admitted
audrey
lazily
stretching
her
arms
they
come
in
by
the
dozen
with
the
morning
post
and
are
generally
chucked
into
the
basket
commented
lorraine
does
help
the
prisoners
of
war
suggestions
please
quick
best
put
an
advertisement
in
the
newspapers
a
new
way
of
raising
money
without
taking
it
out
of
the
pockets
of
subscribers
chuckled
dorothy
look
here
said
lorraine
joking
apart
i
think
everybody
prepared
either
to
give
or
spend
just
a
little
even
the
kids
they
money
enough
for
chalks
pencils
and
all
the
rubbish
they
fill
their
pockets
with
and
swop
in
the
added
claudia
yes
they
swop
exclaimed
patsie
that
exactly
what
they
love
beyond
everything
claudia
castleton
you
given
me
a
brain
wave
we
have
a
elephant
sale
do
look
so
staggered
a
elephant
is
a
thing
you
do
want
yourself
but
which
someone
else
might
like
very
much
we
must
all
of
us
have
got
heaps
of
such
things
at
home
well
we
bring
them
to
school
and
let
them
go
as
bargains
cheap
they
ought
to
go
like
wildfire
and
if
there
are
any
left
we
have
an
auction
it
would
be
prime
fun
patsie
sullivan
i
should
like
to
shake
hands
with
you
declared
lorraine
when
women
go
into
parliament
i
believe
you
become
a
distinguished
member
of
the
house
of
commons
brains
like
yours
ought
to
be
devoted
to
the
service
of
their
country
i
think
it
rather
a
cute
idea
admitted
patsie
modestly
we
get
to
work
upon
it
at
once
the
next
day
lorraine
pinned
up
in
the
a
large
poster
which
ran
as
follows
what
price
white
elephants
have
you
anything
at
home
you
do
want
then
bring
it
to
the
school
and
sell
it
do
you
wish
to
buy
nice
things
cheap
come
to
our
white
elephant
sale
bargains
will
be
flying
you
will
go
home
all
smiles
remember
everything
you
buy
helps
to
feed
a
british
prisoner
of
war
flatter
myself
it
rather
telling
she
confessed
as
she
watched
the
juniors
crowd
round
to
look
there
nothing
like
a
bargain
to
appeal
to
people
i
reckon
it
going
to
catch
on
chuckled
patsie
it
did
catch
on
the
juniors
decided
that
the
idea
was
topping
and
readily
promised
contributions
we
shall
want
cash
too
lorraine
reminded
them
remember
you
to
buy
somebody
else
things
as
well
as
give
your
own
right
you
are
we
make
a
league
if
you
like
oh
i
would
do
that
it
might
be
rough
on
some
of
the
kids
give
what
you
can
that
all
the
next
step
in
the
proceedings
was
to
hunt
at
home
for
white
elephants
lorraine
and
monica
turned
out
drawers
and
cupboards
in
search
of
any
articles
with
which
they
could
dispense
it
not
a
rummage
sale
so
we
must
send
rubbish
decreed
lorraine
it
got
to
be
something
somebody
will
take
a
fancy
to
i
wonder
if
rosemary
wants
this
book
of
songs
i
believe
vivien
would
buy
them
then
put
them
in
the
sale
and
ask
rosemary
afterwards
counselled
monica
rapidly
running
through
the
contents
of
an
indian
box
and
contributing
two
chains
of
eastern
beads
and
some
bangles
i
a
pile
of
old
story
books
i
done
with
i
expect
those
first
form
kids
would
like
them
and
i
some
chalks
and
a
drawing
slate
and
i
an
almost
new
blotter
and
some
indian
curios
and
some
foreign
stamps
and
a
very
good
album
and
a
quite
new
birthday
book
that
kate
greenaway
one
oh
you
promised
to
give
it
to
exclaimed
monica
you

two
of
your
own
already
i
do
care
i
want
this
as
well
then
buy
it
at
the
sale
no
i
going
to
get
jill
box
of
pastels
and
miriam
autograph
album
i
bagged
them
in
advance
tibbiekins
i
have
that
birthday
book
you
ca
cuckoo
do
be
greedy
but
you
well
i
ca
help
it
if
i
did
and
i
do
remember
promising
anyway
that
birthday
book
going
down
to
the
sale
and
if
you
want
it
you
just
have
to
buy
it
there
you
mean
thing
blazed
monica
just
because
you
head
girl
you
think
you
can
do
as
you
like
keep
your
old
birthday
book
and
sell
it
to
anybody
you
can
sha
buy
it
but
i
pay
you
out
for
this
see
if
i
do
i
think
you
perfectly
hateful
lorraine
i
wish
you
go
away
to
a
boarding
school
or
to
a
college
like
rosemary
i
do
want
you
here
at
home
anyway
all
right
draw
it
mild
said
lorraine
who
was
well
accustomed
to
her
younger
sister
outbursts
of
temper
you
really
did
promise
poor
cuckoo
that
kate
greenaway
birthday
book
remarked
forrester
later
in
the
evening
i
ca
remember
anything
at
all
about
it
mother
said
lorraine
impatiently
cuckoo
makes
such
an
absurd
fuss
surely
she
might
be
ready
to
give
up
something
for
the
prisoners
of
war
it
not
good
for
her
always
to
get
her
own
way
she
really
so
absurdly
spoilt
somebody
else
likes
her
own
way
occasionally
suggested
forrester
with
uplifted
eyebrows
well
you
ca
say
i
spoilt
the
middle
girl
never
is
it
rosemary
and
monica
who
get
all
the
attention
in
this
family
declared
lorraine
flouncing
out
of
the
room
in
a
state
of
mind
bordering
on
rebellion
she
wrapped
up
the
birthday
book
in
white
tissue
paper
and
packed
it
the
first
of
all
her
articles
for
the
sale
the
best
of
us
have
our
faults
and
there
was
a
strain
of
obstinacy
in
lorraine
disposition
she
and
monica
had
waged
war
before
this
on
occasion
they
did
not
speak
to
each
other
at
supper
what
a
nice
cheerful
thing
it
is
to
have
two
sitting
at
the
table
commented
forrester
it
so
pleasant
for
the
rest
of
us
is
it
mind
the
milk
does
turn
sour
chuckled
mervyn
you
girls
are
the
limit
the
sale
by
special
permission
of
miss
kingsley
was
fixed
for
three
on
thursday
afternoon
a
whole
hour
lessons
being
remitted
in
its
favour
it
was
to
be
held
in
the
gymnasium
and
the
articles
were
to
be
spread
out
on
benches
each
form
had
contributed
its
own
quota
and
had
appointed
two
representatives
as
saleswomen
the
goods
were
marked
but
bargaining
was
permissible
if
the
figure
was
considered
by
the
saleswoman
to
be
too
high
the
monitresses
constituted
a
court
of
appeal
on
this
score
all
had
done
really
nobly
in
the
way
of
bringing
contributions
and
most
of
the
white
elephants
were
quite
useful
and
desirable
possessions
the
girls
wandered
round
looking
at
an
assortment
of
brooches
penknives
paints
chalks
books
music
blotters
photo
frames
toys
and
a
number
of
little
trifles
such
as
girls
love
lorraine
with
three
weeks
accumulated
pocket
money
a
hitherto
unspent
birthday
present
and
what
was
left
in
her
felt
in
a
position
to
be
munificent
and
determined
to
patronize
each
separate
stall
she
first
made
a
tour
of
them
all
before
she
should
decide
upon
her
purchases
it
quite
a
good
show
said
vivien
fondly
fingering
a
black
cat
mascot
she
had
just
bought
and
fastened
upon
her
blouse
seen
the
things
they
ripping
some
of
them
they
must
have
been
looting
at
home
i
got
the
prettiest
little
purse
i
show
it
to
you
only
gave
sixpence
for
it
it
a
real
bargain
i
been
wanting
a
muff
chain
for
declared
nellie
i
put
it
down
regularly
on
my
birthday
and
christmas
lists
but
my
family
always
gave
me
something
else
instead
now
do
you
think
this
is
just
the
jinkiest
one
you
ever
seen
i
ca
think
how
audrey
could
part
with
it
muff
chains
are
fashionable
now
that
wo
trouble
me
in
the
least
i
hunted
out
my
old
dolls
and
dolls
clothes
said
claire
and
the
kids
went
wild
over
them
dora
does
care
for
dolls
so
it
was
no
use
keeping
them
for
she
a
regular
tomboy
what
did
you
bring
claudia
asked
nellie
those
and
copies
of
dad
let
me
have
them
from
his
studio
oh
goody
they
the
very
things
i
want
rejoiced
lorraine
tell
patsie
not
to
sell
them
till
i
come
she
had
reached
the
second
form
stall
and
was
hurriedly
reviewing
its
contents
gazing
over
the
heads
of
a
chattering
mob
of
juniors
suddenly
she
gave
a
gasp
of
consternation
in
the
middle
of
the
bench
temptingly
spread
forth
in
a
row
were
a
number
of
objects
with
which
she
was
familiar
some
coloured
supplements
from
christmas
numbers
a
mug
with
a
robin
on
it
a
sandalwood
box
a
carved
photo
frame
a
travelling
two
plaques
of
thorwaldsen
night
and
morning
and
a
model
of
a
swiss
chalet
they
were
household
articles
which
she
had
appropriated
to
herself
and
had
hidden
away
for
safety
in
a
drawer
on
the
top
landing
at
home
each
one
was
a
treasure
she
loved
the
coloured
supplements
and
had
meant
to
have
them
framed
when
she
could
afford
it
the
robin
mug
was
her
last
link
with
childhood
the
chalet
though
really
the
property
of
richard
had
been
knocking
about
in
the
attic
till
she
had
rescued
it
and
the
other
things
had
all
been
apparently
discarded
by
their
rightful
owners
until
she
had
adopted
them
to
see
them
here
laid
out
ready
for
sale
was
a
shock
it
that
abominable
little
wretch
of
a
cuckoo
i
slay
her
for
this
she
thought
grimly
and
started
off
to
find
the
offender
she
discovered
her
among
a
crowd
of
kindred
and
dragged
her
away
into
a
discreet
corner
what
do
you
mean
by
prigging
my
things
for
your
stall
she
demanded
angrily
they
not
your
things
retorted
monica
not
more
than
anybody
else
those
coloured
pictures
belong
to
father
and
mother
and
the
chalet
was
richard
only
i
sure
he
does
want
it
and
the
the
one
aunt
ellie
left
behind
and
the
photo
frame
is
rosemary
i
found
them
all
in
a
drawer
on
the
top
landing
you
knew
i
put
them
there
monica
coloured
to
the
tips
of
her
ears
they
as
much
mine
as
yours
she
flared
did
mother
say
you
might
have
them
i
did
ask
her
and
no
more
did
you
when
you
took
them
anyhow
they
elephants
now
and
sale
you
must
get
them
back
monica
urged
lorraine
desperately
tell
kitty
and
joan
you
took
them
by
mistake
how
can
i
really
lorraine
i
wonder
at
you
do
you
want
me
to
disgrace
the
family
nice
thing
it
would
look
for
the
head
girl
sister
to
take
things
back
that
she
just
given
why
the
whole
form
would
scoff
at
us
surely
you
might
be
ready
to
give
up
something
for
the
prisoners
of
war
that
what
you
said
about
me
at
any
rate
if
you
want
your
old
things
you
must
buy
them
back
and
monica
making
a
sudden
dive
between
two
fifth
form
girls
escaped
from
her
sister
and
sought
the
farthest
corner
of
the
gymnasium
in
spite
of
her
indignation
lorraine
could
not
help
acknowledging
that
there
was
justice
in
these
remarks
it
would
certainly
be
most
undignified
and
in
fact
impossible
to
take
back
articles
once
given
to
the
sale
cuckoo
taunt
about
the
prisoners
of
war
stung
lorraine
badly
if
she
wanted
her
treasures
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
put
the
best
face
she
could
on
the
matter
and
buy
them
at
once
before
anybody
else
had
an
innings
it
might
already
be
too
late
in
considerable
anxiety
she
hurried
back
to
the
stall
and
found
a
junior
critically
handling
the
robin
mug
she
snatched
it
from
the
child
with
scant
ceremony
if
you
do
want
this
doris
i
do
how
much
kitty
please
i
take
these
pictures
too
yes
and
this
chalet
and
i
have
the
and
the
frame
as
well
that
all
if
you
make
them
into
a
parcel
thanks
and
lorraine
sailed
away
leaving
doris
and
kitty
cheerfully
clinking
the
change
in
her
brown
leather
moneybag
it
was
annoying
to
have
spent
so
much
for
it
meant
forgoing
a
piece
of
music
which
she
had
intended
to
give
to
morland
she
watched
her
cousin
buy
it
instead
i
borrow
it
from
vivien
and
copy
it
she
thought
rapidly
or
if
morland
plays
it
twice
over
he
have
it
by
heart
hallo
four
already
and
these
stalls
not
half
cleared
we
shall
have
to
have
an
auction
patsie
on
being
consulted
agreed
and
readily
undertook
the
post
of
auctioneer
to
which
she
was
voted
by
general
accord
i
do
know
whether
to
take
it
as
compliment
or
not
she
twittered
i
suppose
you
think
i
got
the
gift
of
the
gab
and
will
make
a
good
cheap
jack
well
i
do
my
best
for
you
here
goes
give
me
a
ruler
or
something
for
a
hammer
a
treble
line
of
girls
spread
themselves
round
in
an
amused
circle
patsie
and
especially
patsie
in
a
bantering
mood
was
always
worth
listening
to
they
prepared
themselves
for
a
of
sheer
fun
the
amateur
auctioneer
or
rather
auctioneeress
seized
upon
the
first
thing
that
came
to
hand
which
happened
to
be
one
of
claire
discarded
dolls
she
held
it
aloft
and
descanted
eloquently
upon
its
virtues
look
at
this
she
proclaimed
a
real
parisian
doll
jumeau
je
fais
dodo
je
voudrais
une
and
all
the
rest
of
it
kindly
notice
they
real
ball
joints
and
not
just
slung
together
with
bits
of
elastic
observe
the
beautiful
little
teeth
that
might
have
stepped
out
of
a
dentist

with

in

she
descanted
upon
the
merits
of
a
cracked
teapot
the
beauties
of
a
battered
birdcage
or
the
capacity
of
a
japanese
the
fun
of

many
of

more

however
to

miss

had
made
a

that
no

as
the

grew
thin
the
objects
on

went
off
as

expressed
it
dirt
cheap

several

secured
bargains

to

persuasive

the

goods
was
at

disposed

and
quite
a
nice
little
sum
was
counted
up
for

the
girls
trudged
home
with
their

in
high
spirits

the
whole

success
and
laughing
immoderately
over
some
of
the
incidents

in
an
unwonted
mood
of

offered
to
copy
the
piece
of
music
for
her

her
particular
treasures
securely
in
her
bottom
drawer
but
that
night
when
she
was
settling
snugly
on
her
pillow
there
was
a
patter
of
bedroom
slippers
along
the
landing
her
door
burst
open
and
a
little
sobbing
figure
came
creeping
into
her

chapter
x
a
sinister
incident
home
and
the
gables
lorraine
found
her
life
that
autumn
a
very
busy
one
as
head
girl
the
demands
made
on
her
time
were
considerable
she
sometimes
thought
it
would
have
been
easier
to
be
at
a
boarding
school
where
her
whole
energies
could
have
been
focused
upon
school
matters
private
interests
though
very
enthralling
were
certainly
a
hindrance
and
there
were
so
many
of
them
her
painting
lessons
and
delightful
intimacy
with
margaret
lindsay
and
the
rich
art
world
that
had
thereby
opened
its
doors
to
her
an
increasing
friendship
with
morland
castleton
whose
musical
genius
spurred
her
on
to
fresh
efforts
at
her
violin
her
affection
for
claudia
and
for
the
rest
of
the
merry
crew
of
the
castleton
family
to
say
nothing
of
the
dear
home
people
who
claimed
her
attention
richard
and
donald
fighting
in
france
rodney
making
his
first
flights
in
the
air
force
rosemary
hard
at
work
in
the
college
of
music
and
writing
ecstatic
weekly
budgets
of
her
experiences
mervyn
with
his
fun
and
nonsense
and
gossip
from
the
grammar
school
and
monica
who
was
the
spoilt
darling
of
the
family
whatever
her
faults
lorraine
possessed
to
the
full
that
intense
zest
of
life
that
the
french
call
using
up
one
heart
it
is
a
gift
that
thank
god
the
war
has
given
to
most
of
our
british
girlhood
the
old
fashionable
attitude
of
boredom
that
at
one
time
spread
like
a
blight
over
certain
classes
of
society
is
happily
passing
away
purged
by
the
common
need
of
sacrifice
it
is
incredible
that
at
one
time
girls
could
exist
in
this
world
possessed
of
eyes
and
ears
and
pass
by
the
touching
dramatic
joyous
human
comedy
as
though
they
were
blind
and
deaf
all
the
things
we
learn
at
school
are
of
no
value
to
us
unless
with
them
we
learn
to
love
life
life
in
all
its
aspects
of
joy
and
sorrow
laughter
and
tears
work
and
pleasure
there
was
so
much
going
on
at
the
gables
both
in
lessons
and
games
the
hockey
season
had
begun
and
every
wednesday
afternoon
the
school
played
in
a
field
on
the
cliffs
which
they
rented
under
the
coaching
of
miss
paget
a
new
mistress
the
teams
were
improving
dorothy
as
captain
made
a
much
better
leader
than
helen
stanley
had
done
a
year
ago
and
patsie
and
vivien
as
were
considered
rising
stars
the
second
team
which
hitherto
had
been
rather
contemptible
raised
its
standard
to
an
amazing
extent
and
seemed
to
promise
great
things
the
girls
began
to
look
forward
to
wednesdays
one
bright
sunny
afternoon
in
early
november
they
were
assembled
on
the
field
in
their
navy
serge
skirts
and
scarlet
jerseys
they
made
a
bright
patch
of
colour
against
the
green
of
the
grass
and
the
autumn
blue
of
the
sky
and
the
expanse
of
sea
that
spread
beneath
the
yellow
cliffs
it
was
a
pretty
scene
with
a
background
of
gorse
bushes
and
a
foreground
of
corn
marigold
that
edged
the
field
the
sunshine
fell
on
the
athletic
figures
and
hatless
heads
of
the
teams
a
very
pretty
scene
indeed
and
so
evidently
thought
a
individual
who
was
dodging
about
the
gate
busy
with
a
camera
he
fixed
a
stand
put
his
head
repeatedly
under
a
black
velvet
cloth
and
was
apparently
focusing
upon
the
groups
of
players
the
girls
noticed
him
and
pointed
him
out
to
miss
paget
the
dragon
in
her
was
at
once
roused
to
wrath
and
she
advanced
in
defence
of
her
flock
may
i
ask
on
what
authority
you
taking
photographs
of
this
school
she
asked
icily
the
stranger
was
all
smiles
and
civility
he
displayed
an
excellent
set
of
teeth
as
with
a
decidedly
foreign
bow
and
flourish
of
his
hat
he
offered
a
plausible
explanation
i
ask
your
pardon
madam
i
am
an
american
a
journalist
i
have
been
sent
by
my
newspaper
to
england
to
write
an
article
upon
girls
schools
i
have
heard
of
yours
and
wish
to
include
it
in
my
report
with
a
photo
of
its
pupils
i
crave
your
permission
to
take
a
snapshot
of
the
game
miss
paget
stared
at
him
with
suspicion
she
was
a
good
judge
of
character
and
had
studied
types
of
nationality
moreover
she
had
herself
spent
six
months
in
the
united
states
the
man
physiognomy
and
accent
were
anything
but
american
she
would
set
them
down
as
decidedly
teutonic
certainly
not
she
replied
miss
kingsley
would
not
dream
of
permitting
it
but
i
have
permission
from
miss
kingsley
he
fawned
i
am
to
send
her
photos
miss
kingsley
did
not
mention
the
matter
to
me
and
unless
i
have
her
express
directions
i
can
not
allow
it
will
you
kindly
remove
your
camera
just
one
little
snapshot
he
begged
insinuatingly
you
interrupted
our
game
will
you
please
go
and
i
must
remind
you
that
this
is
a
military
area
and
that
unless
you
have
a
signed
permit
for
photography
you
are
liable
to
be
arrested
oh
that
is
all
right
i
have
the
credentials
of
my
newspaper
as
well
as
the
assent
of
miss
kingsley
miss
paget
temper
which
had
been
rapidly
rising
now
fizzed
over
if
you
do
take
yourself
off
i
send
some
of
my
pupils
to
fetch
the
she
thundered
with
an
apologetic
shrug
of
the
shoulders
the
interloper
packed
up
his
camera
and
departed
not
without
trying
to
secure
a
hurried
surreptitious
snapshot
with
a
small
kodak
an
effort
which
was
nipped
in
the
bud
by
miss
paget
who
stood
like
a
sentry
at
the
gate
speeding
his
departure
she
watched
him
till
he
was
safely
out
of
sight
and
then
joined
the
excited
girls
some
of
whom
had
overheard
the
conversation
that
no
american
she
proclaimed
and
i
do
for
a
moment
believe
that
he
had
permission
from
miss
kingsley
to
photograph
the
school
she
have
said
so
surely
commented
vivien
probably
he
did
even
know
her
name
till
you
mentioned
it
miss
paget
said
lorraine
he
a
foreigner
in
my
opinion
possibly
a
spy
continued
the
mistress
this
field
would
make
a
most
excellent
for
enemy
aircraft
one
ca
be
too
careful
in
these
matters
living
as
we
do
near
the
coast
in
a
military
zone
the
cheek
of
the
man
too
calmly
to
set
up
his
camera
and
begin
to
take
us
without
asking
leave
even
in
times
of
peace
it
would
be
unpardonable
i
must
say
i
have
the
very
strongest
suspicions
of
his
intentions
it
seems
rather
the
wrong
time
for
an
american
magazine
to
be
wanting
an
article
on
english
girls
schools
said
patsie
it
the
most
flimsy
excuse
the
affair
made
quite
a
sensation
in
the
school
miss
kingsley
when
the
matter
was
reported
to
her
disclaimed
all
knowledge
of
the
photographer
or
any
commission
to
him
to
take
the
hockey
teams
she
was
justly
indignant
and
almost
thought
of
mentioning
the
incident
to
the
police
the
girls
talked
the
affair
threadbare
they
were
quite
sure
they
had
had
an
encounter
with
a
spy
their
suspicions
were
further
justified
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
by
an
experience
of
lorraine
she
was
going
by
train
on
saturday
morning
to
ranock
a
little
place
a
few
miles
from
porthkeverne
whither
her
mother
had
sent
her
to
return
some
books
to
a
friend
who
lived
near
the
station
there
were
several
other
people
in
the
compartment
and
sitting
in
the
corner
on
the
side
next
to
the
sea
was
a
man
whom
lorraine
was
nearly
sure
she
recognized
as
the
pertinacious
stranger
of
the
hockey
field
she
watched
him
now
keenly
he
was
gazing
out
of
the
window
at
the
and
stretches
of
marshy
shore
presently
they
passed
the
golf
links
and
quick
as
thought
he
whisked
a
little
kodak
from
his
pocket
and
began
to
take
instantaneous
photographs
through
the
carriage
window
lorraine
uttered
an
exclamation
and
nudged
the
gentleman
who
sat
next
to
her
promptly
he
interfered
look
here
snapshots
are
allowed
without
a
permit
he
remonstrated
the
photographer
slipped
the
kodak
back
into
his
pocket
and
smiled
his
former
plausible
smile
i
am
an
american
he
began
a
journalist
i
have
been
sent
by
my
newspaper
to
england
to
write
an
article
upon
golf
links
i
wish
to
include
those
of
porthkeverne
with
illustrations
have
you
a
permit
persisted
his
you
get
yourself
into
trouble
if
you
have
the
authorities
are
uncommonly
strict
about
it
it
a
queer
dodge
to
photograph
the
golf
links
from
a
railway
carriage
commented
someone
else
not
at
all
i
take
hundreds
of
photos
for
my
magazine
in
this
way
explained
the
journalist
well
you
just
not
take
any
now
returned
the
other
if
you
do
i
shall
inform
the
guard
lorraine
listened
excitedly
she
was
quite
loath
to
leave
the
compartment
at
ranock
she
wondered
to
what
destination
the
man
was
travelling
and
hoped
that
the
other
passengers
would
keep
an
eye
on
him
she
went
that
afternoon
to
see
her
uncle
barton
forrester
who
was
a
special
constable
and
told
him
about
both
incidents
he
looked
thoughtful
i
report
the
matter
to
wakelin
he
commented
one
ca
be
too
careful
in
a
place
like
this
of
course
the
fellow
might
have
a
permit
but
it
had
better
be
inquired
into
give
me
as
accurate
a
description
of
him
as
you
can
lorraine
shut
her
eyes
visualized
and
gave
her
impressions
of
the
stranger
uncle
barton
rapidly
jotted
down
a
few
notes
he
communicated
the
result
to
the
chief
constable
who
issued
an
order
that
the
next
time
anyone
answering
to
that
description
was
sighted
his
photographic
permit
was
to
be
demanded
and
inspected
there
is
such
a
thing
however
as
shutting
the
stable
door
after
the
steed
is
stolen
and
in
spite
of
the
vigilance
of
the
local
police
nothing
further
was
seen
or
heard
of
the
enterprising
photographer
he
had
evidently
betaken
himself
and
his
camera
to
other
scenes
of
adventure
the
school
talked
about
the
episode
for
a
while
with
bated
breath
then
forgot
it
in
the
whirl
of
other
interests
it
was
getting
near
christmas
time
and
there
was
ever
so
much
to
be
done
in
preparation
the
excitement
of
the
moment
was
the
rhythmic
dancing
display
all
the
term
a
teacher
had
been
coming
weekly
from
cyr
and
those
lucky
individuals
who
were
members
of
the
dancing
class
had
had
the
time
of
their
lives
of
course
the
musical
ones
and
those
with
some
idea
of
the
poetry
of
motion
scored
the
most
but
even
those
who
were
not
naturally
graceful
enjoyed
the
movements
miss
kingsley
had
decided
that
her
pupils
should
give
a
display
of
what
they
had
learnt
and
invited
an
audience
of
parents
and
friends
to
the
gymnasium
on
day
the
performance
was
to
begin
at
three
and
long
before
that
hour
the
proud
band
of
selected
artistes
arrayed
in
their
costumes
were
assembled
ready
in
the
small
studio
which
served
as
a
there
were
a
good
many
of
them
and
the
space
was
limited
so
it
was
a
decided
cram
everybody
seems
to
take
up
so
much
more
room
than
usual
declared
patsie
flinging
out
a
long
arm
with
a
floral
garland
and
hitting
effie
swan
by
accident
in
the
eye
of
course
they
do
when
they
as
clumsy
as
you
are
retorted
that
distressed
damsel
with
her
handkerchief
to
the
injured
orb
i
call
you
the
absolute
limit
patsie
you
fit
for
nothing
but
a
barn
dance
clogs
would
suit
you
better
than
sandals
gently
child
gently
sorry
if
i
hurt
your
eye
but
do
let
that
warp
your
judgment
the
flower
quadrille
going
to
be
rather
choice
though
i
say
it
as
should
the
others
part
of
it
perhaps
but
not
yours
there
do
get
excited
i
forgive
you
it
for
me
to
forgive
not
for
you
i
think
grumbled
effie
a
nice
object
i
shall
look
dancing
with
my
eye
all
red
and
inflamed
i
wish
the
gym
were
a
larger
room
groused
theresa
the
dances
would
have
a
much
better
effect
if
there
were
more
space
for
them
and
i
should
like
a
parquet
floor
what
else
would
you
like
snapped
lorraine
some
people
would
grumble
in
paradise
the
old
gym
not
such
a
bad
place
for
a
performance
and
the
floor
has
been
chalked
i
think
myself
it
a
very
decent
sort
of
room
would
you
like
to
dance
on
the
lawn
not
in
december
thanks
are
you
ready
girls
asked
miss
paget
opening
the
door
miss
leighton
has
just
come
and
we
going
to
begin
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
dances
were
extremely
pretty
miss
leighton
was
an
excellent
teacher
and
her
pupils
did
her
credit
the
audience
was
charmed
and
clapped
with
the
utmost
enthusiasm
at
the
end
of
each
performance
there
was
a
daisy
dance
in
which
twelve
little
girls
dressed
to
represent
daisies
went
through
a
series
of
very
graceful
movements
and
a
rose
gavotte
that
was
equally
pretty
and
tasteful
a
butterflies
ball
in
which
the
dancers
waved
gorgeous
wings
of
painted
muslin
was
highly
effective
and
so
was
the
russian
mazurka
given
by
vivien
and
dorothy
attired
in
costumes
and
high
scarlet
leather
boots
the
babies
looked
sweet
in
a
doll
dance
and
little
beatrice
perry
made
a
sensation
by
her
as
cupid
dressed
in
a
classic
toga
with
the
orthodox
bow
and
arrows
she
was
a
beautifully
made
child
of
six
and
danced
barefooted
so
she
looked
the
part
admirably
and
quite
carried
the
audience
by
storm
monica
with
floating
fair
hair
a
figured
muslin
dress
and
a
basket
of
flowers
capered
as
a
spring
wind
and
dropped
blossoms
in
the
path
of
april
even
patsie
the
overgrown
looked
quite
pretty
in
her
flower
quadrille
but
everybody
decided
that
the
star
of
the
afternoon
was
claudia
she
was
beautiful
to
begin
with
and
her
costume
suited
her
exactly
perhaps
her
long
experience
in
posing
as
a
model
for
her
father
pictures
made
it
easier
for
her
to
learn
the
right
postures
she
had
dropped
into
the
rhythmic
dancing
as
into
a
birthright
her
movements
seemed
the
very
embodiment
of
natural
grace
and
to
watch
her
was
like
surprising
the
fairies
at
dawn
or
the
dryads
and
oreads
in
a
classic
forest
the
best
of
claudia
was
that
she
was
quite
without
she
danced
because
she
enjoyed
it
not
to
command
admiration
she
received
the
storm
of
clapping
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
just
as
she
took
the
exhibition
of
her
many
portraits
in
the
academy
i
give
anything
to
have
your
face
said
patsie
enviously
to
her
afterwards
some
folks
are
luckers
why
was
born
pretty
it
gives
people
such
a
tremendous
pull
i
do
know
answered
claudia
rather
taken
aback
at
the
question
look
here
said
lorraine
we
got
to
take
the
faces
our
mothers
gave
us
have
you
heard
of
a
beautiful
person
i
know
several
who
have
a
single
decent
feature
and
yet
somehow
they
lovely
in
spite
of
it
all
some
of
the
most
fascinating
women
in
the
world
have
been
plain
george
sand
had
an
atom
of
beauty
and
yet
she
enthralled
two
such
geniuses
as
chopin
and
alfred
de
musset
i
go
in
for
fascination
then
rattled
on
patsie
we
ca
all
be
in
the
same
style
claudia
shall
do
the
venus
business
and
i
be
a
siren
oh
no
sirens
were
wretches
why
i
thought
they
were
only
a
sort
of
mermaid
well
i
be
very
modern
chic
and
and
witty
and
and
all
the
rest
of
it
and
i
have
a
salon
like
those
french
women
used
to
have
and
everybody
want
to
come
to
it
and
talk
about
the
charming
miss
sullivan
only
perhaps
i
be
somebody
by
that
time
i
hope
so
at
any
rate
i
do
mean
to
be
left
in
the
lurch
if
i
can
help
it
what
shall
you
do
if
you
are
laughed
lorraine
go
in
for
a
career

dear

patsie
airily

or

or
doctoring

open
to
us
women
now
well
i
would
try
rhythmic

at
any

hurried

like

rosemary

was

on

i
call
it
cruelty
to
send
me
every

to
sit
for

whole
hours
at
a
horrid
little
desk
stuffing
my

with

richard
you
got

badly
it
a
disease
i
used
to
suffer
from

they
called
it
when
i
was
young
they
cured
it
with
a
medicine
called
if
i
remember
rightly
one
of
those
good
remedies
do
you
know
that
our
grandmothers
always
went
by
you
making
fun
of
me
chafed
monica
and
i
do
really
mean
what
i
say
it
cold
at
school
and
horrid
and
miss
davis
is
always
down
on
me
and
i
hate
it
why
must
i
go
and
must
i
go
back
to
the
trenches
all
serene
you
and
i
find
a
desert
island
together
somewhere
and
live
upon
it
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
you
see
they
never
have
us
back
again
if
we
deserted
we
have
to
stop
on
our
island
for
evermore
i
thought
you
liked
the
gables
yawned
elsie
vivien
does
i
sure
it
a
very
nice
school
oh
vivien
i
dare
say
it
all
very
fine
for
monitresses
but
when
you
in
the
third
form
and
your
desk
on
the
cold
side
of
the
room
it
the
limit
yes
i
dare
say
i
get
chilblains
if
i
sit
close
to
the
fire
i
do
the
first
day
always
a
little
grizzly
agreed
lorraine
who
had
followed
monica
to
the
and
joined
the
circle
of
one
hates
getting
into
harness
again
after
the
holidays
i
believe
rosemary
the
only
one
of
us
who
really
enthuses
you
be
gone
too
by
next
week
quavers
but
i
suppose
you
really
singing
exercises
and
having
professors
storming
at
you
of
course
i
do
said
rosemary
with
a
rather
unconvincing
note
in
her
voice
lorraine
glanced
at
her
quickly
but
the
little
brown
head
was
lowered
and
shadows
hid
the
sweet
face
lorraine
could
not
understand
rosemary
these
holidays
she
had
returned
from
her
first
term
at
the
college
of
music
seemingly
as
full
of
enthusiasm
as
ever
and
yet
there
was
a
something
she
gave
rapturous
accounts
of
pupils
concerts
of
singing
classes
of
of
rising
stars
in
the
musical
world
of
favourite
teachers
of
fun
at
the
college
and
at
the
hostel
where
she
boarded
she
had
made
many
new
friendships
and
was
apparently
having
the
time
of
her
life
from
her
accounts
you
think
it
was
all
skittles
but
i
sure
a
hitch
somewhere
mused
lorraine
rosemary
with
her
big
eyes
and
bigger
aspirations
had
always
been
more
or
less
of
a
problem
the
family
had
decided
emphatically
that
she
was
its
genius
they
looked
for
great
things
from
her
when
her
course
at
the
college
should
be
finished
they
all
experienced
a
sort
of
credit
in
her
anticipated
achievements
it
is
so
nice
to
have
someone
else
to
do
the
clever
things
while
we
ourselves
wear
a
reflected
glory
thereby
forrester
of
her
musical
chick
could
not
refrain
from
a
little
gentle
boasting
about
her
daughter
talents
she
told
everybody
that
she
liked
girls
to
have
careers
and
that
parents
ought
to
make
every
effort
to
let
a
gifted
child
have
a
chance
in
lorraine
estimation
rosemary
future
was
to
be
one
round
of
triumph
ending
possibly
in
a
peal
of
wedding
bells
lorraine
was
fond
of
making
up
romances
and
had
evolved
a
hero
for
her
sister
he
was
always
tall
but
his
eyes
varied
in
colour
and
he
sometimes
had
a
moustache
and
sometimes
was
though
his
personal
appearance
varied
from
day
to
day
his
general
qualities
persisted
and
he
invariably
possessed
a
in
scotland
where
he
would
be
prepared
to
extend
a
warm
welcome
to
his
bride
younger
sister
meantime
though
rosemary
had
been
a
whole
term
at
the
college
her
family
had
no
means
of
judging
her
progress
she
had
diligently
practised
scales
exercises
and
arpeggios
but
had
steadfastly
refused
to
sing
any
songs
to
them
vainly
they
had
begged
for
old
favourites
she
was
obdurate
to
the
point
of
obstinacy
signor
arezzo
does
want
me
to
i
studying
on
his
special
method
and
he
most
particular
about
it
he
keeps
everybody
at
exercises
for
the
first
term
when
i
go
back
he
says
perhaps
he
let
me
have
just
song
but
surely
it
could
spoil
your
voice
to
sing
happy
garden
demanded
her
father
much
disappointed
he
forbade
it
declared
rosemary
emphatically
this
new
attitude
of
rosemary
of
hiding
her
light
under
a
bushel
was
trying
to
lorraine
she
had
been
looking
forward
to
showing
off
her
clever
musical
sister
to
morland
she
had
expected
the
two
to
become
chums
at
once
but
they
did
nothing
of
the
sort
rosemary
treated
morland
with
the
airy
patronage
that
a
girl
who
has
just
begun
to
mix
with
older
men
sometimes
metes
out
to
a
boy
of
seventeen
she
was
not
nearly
as
much
impressed
by
his
playing
as
lorraine
had
anticipated
he
ought
to
learn
from
signor
rassuli
she
commented
nobody
who
has
studied
on
method
can
possibly
have
a
touch
but
morland
exquisite
touch
is
his
great
point
persisted
lorraine
indignantly
i
ca
stand
the
boy
yawned
rosemary
it
is
always
most
amazing
when
we
like
a
person
exceedingly
ourselves
to
find
that
somebody
else
has
formed
a
different
opinion
with
all
his
shortcomings
lorraine
appreciated
morland
he
often
missed
his
appointments
and
was
generally
late
for
everything
but
when
he
turned
up
he
played
her
accompaniments
as
no
one
else
ever
played
them
moreover
he
was
a
very
pleasant
companion
and
full
of
fun
in
a
mild
artistic
sort
of
fashion
of
his
own
he
was
certainly
one
of
the
central
figures
in
the
beautiful
shiftless
bohemian
household
on
the
hill
lorraine
had
a
sense
that
when
he
went
the
castleton
family
would
lose
its
corner
stone
yet
some
day
he
would
be
bound
to
go
i
expect
to
be
called
up
in
march
he
announced
one
day
illustration
everything
gone
wrong
declared
lorraine
tragically
lorraine
looked
at
him
critically
morland
with
his
ripply
hair
and
the
features
of
a
fra
angelico
angel
would
seem
out
of
place
in
khaki
his
dreamy
unpunctual
ways
and
general
lack
of
concentration
would
be
highly
exasperating
to
his
she
wondered
what
would
happen
when
as
usual
he
turned
up
late
artistic
temperaments
did
not
fit
in
well
with
the
stern
realities
of
life
she
had
a
feeling
that
they
ought
to
be
exempted
music
this
term
was
more
to
the
fore
than
usual
in
lorraine
horizon
after
christmas
a
fresh
teacher
had
come
to
the
school
who
gave
lessons
in
french
violin
and
piano
her
name
was
madame
bertier
and
she
was
a
russian
by
birth
though
her
husband
was
a
belgian
at
present
interned
in
germany
she
was
a
new
arrival
at
porthkeverne
and
had
rooms
in
the
quarter
of
the
town
she
spent
her
mornings
at
the
gables
and
filled
up
her
afternoons
by
taking
private
pupils
like
most
russians
she
had
a
charming
manner
and
was
brimming
over
with
talent
she
was
a
woman
with
a
clear
pale
complexion
flashing
hazel
eyes
and
carefully
arranged
coiffure
her
delicate
hands
were
exquisitely
manicured
she
dressed
becomingly
and
wore
handsome
rings
her
foreign
accent
was
decidedly
pretty
most
of
the
school
and
the
sixth
form
in
particular
went
crazy
over
her
they
admired
her
frocks
her
hair
her
earrings
and
the
whole
charming
air
of
finish
about
her
it
became
the
fashion
of
the
moment
to
adore
her
those
girls
who
took
private
music
lessons
from
her
were
counted
lucky
the
members
of
the
french
class
vied
with
one
another
in
presenting
offerings
of
violets
or
early
snowdrops
she
accepted
the
little
bouquets
as
gracefully
as
a
prima
donna
she
most
absolutely
topping
person
i
ever
met
affirmed
vivien
who
was
one
of
her
most
ardent
worshippers
um
well
enough
said
lorraine
whose
head
was
not
turned
by
the
new
idol
she
not
quite
my
style
somehow
i
always
feel
she
out
for
admiration
well
she
deserves
to
be
admired
not
so
consciously
though
i
think
she
too
precious
for
words
it
something
even
to
be
in
the
same
room
with
her
gushed
audrey
i
scored
over
you
vivien
because
she
written
two
verses
in
my
album
and
she
only
wrote
one
in
yours
yes
but
it
was
original
poetry
in
mine
how
do
you
know
when
it
in
russian
she
said
so
at
any
rate
oh
i
must
ask
her
to
put
in
an
original
one
for
me
she
coming
to
tea
with
us
you
lucker
there
seemed
no
lengths
to
which
the
girls
would
not
go
several
of
them
kept
sentimental
diaries
in
which
were
recorded
the
doings
and
sayings
of
their
deity
audrey
ran
as
follows
a
new
sun
rose
in
the
sky
and
the
world
of
school
has
changed
for
me
i
could
do
nothing
but
gaze
her
name
is
madame
bertier
her
christian
name
is
olga
petrovna
she
looked
directly
at
me
and
i
blushed
she
smiled
upon
me
she
accepted
my
flowers
a
black
day
vivien
has
engrossed
her
entirely
i
have
asked
mother
to
call
upon
her
the
world
dark
mother
too
busy
to
call
mother
called
hooray
she
is
coming
to
tea
i
feel
i
am
treading
on
air
she
has
been
to
our
house
it
was
the
happiest
day
of
my
life
though
she
came
as
a
stranger
to
porthkeverne
madame
bertier
very
soon
found
friends
her
attractive
personality
and
her
musical
talent
gained
her
the
entrée
into
the
artistic
and
literary
circles
of
the
town
two
principal
asked
her
to
sit
for
her
portrait
and
her
violin
was
much
in
demand
for
concerts
at
the
arts
club
like
most
of
the
bohemian
residents
of
the
place
she
found
her
way
to
the
studio
at
windy
howe
and
a
pastel
drawing
of
her
profile
soon
stood
on
castleton
easel
she
did
not
win
universal
favour
however
at
the
house
on
the
hill
claudia
walking
from
school
one
day
with
lorraine
exploded
upon
the
subject
i
ca
bear
the
woman
i
do
know
what
vivien
and
the
others
see
in
her
i
call
it
very
flashy
to
wear
all
that
jewellery
at
school
always
up
at
our
house
and
morland
fearfully
taken
with
her
they
play
duets
by
the
hour
together
father
going
to
paint
her
as
angel
of
victory
in
that
huge
cartoon
he
designing
for
the
chagstead
town
hall
i
do
think
she
a
scrap
like
an
angel
she
pats
lilith
and
constable
on
the
head
just
for
show
but
she
looks
terrified
if
they
come
near
her
smart
frocks
violet
detests
her
it
the
one
thing
violet
and
i
agree
about
we
been
squabbling
over
everything
else
lately
it
a
weary
world
madame
fascinating
enough
on
the
surface
agreed
lorraine
thoughtfully
but
she
not
the
kind
of
woman
i
admire
somehow
i
quite
trust
her
do
you
believe
in
first
impressions
so
do
i
well
my
first
feeling
about
her
was
distinctly
we
ran
away
from
each
other
mentally
like
two
pieces
of
magnetized
steel
she
very
sweet
to
me
at
my
music
lessons
but
i
sure
it
all
put
on
and
she
does
care
an
atom
it
an
entirely
different
thing
from
my
saturday
lessons
one
great
reason
why
lorraine
had
not
with
the
rest
of
the
school
fallen
under
the
spell
of
the
fascinating
russian
lady
was
the
intense
affection
she
had
formed
for
her
art
teacher
she
could
not
worship
at
both
shrines
and
she
felt
strongly
that
margaret
lindsay
was
infinitely
more
worthy
of
admiration
the
studio
down
by
the
harbour
was
still
her
artistic
mecca
she
had
a
carte
blanche
invitation
to
go
whenever
she
liked
she
turned
in
there
one
friday
afternoon
on
her
way
from
school
carina
she
said
flopping
into
a
by
the
fireside
just
fed
up
the
friendship
which
had
begun
conventionally
with
the
orthodox
miss
lindsay
now
expressed
itself
by
margaret
peggy
or
such
pet
terms
as
carina
and
what
the
matter
asked
her
friend
squeezing
a
little
extra
on
to
her
palette
and
putting
the
cap
on
the
tube
again
it
is
often
fed
up
with
life
everything
gone
wrong
declared
lorraine
tragically
my
head
aches
and
i
did
know
my
literature
and
miss
janet
glared
at
me
and
maths
were
a
failure
this
morning
too
and
i
felt
scratchy
and
squabbled
with
everybody
i
afraid
i
was
rather
hard
on
some
of
those
kids
though
they
were
the
limit
carina
when
were
at
school
did
you
sometimes
have
a
fling
out
all
round
or
were
you
always
good
i
confess
said
carina
humorously
that
when
i
trod
the
slippery
paths
of
youth
i
often
flopped
flat
and
made
an
exhibition
of
myself
i
do
think
i
was
a
nice
child
at
all
i
call
you
a
saint
now
i
wonder
what
most
saints
were
like
when
they
were
young
many
of
them
began
as
sinners
i
expect
even
francis
of
assisi
howled
when
he
was
a
baby
and
smacked
his
nurse
we
all
feel
more
or
less
scratchy
sometimes
what
you
want
child
is
a
good
blow
on
the
hills
if
it
should
be
as
fine
and
mild
as
it
was
this
morning
we
have
our
painting
lesson
out
of
doors
bring
your
thick
coat
and
a
wrap
and
we
go
right
up
towards
tangy
point
take
our
lunch
and
our
with
us
find
a
sheltered
place
in
the
sun
and
paint
some
pretty
little
bit
on
the
cliffs
you
go
back
to
school
on
monday
feeling
at
peace
with
all
mankind
or
rather
girlkind
do
you
like
my
prescription
rather
you
the
best
doctor
out
it
be
glorious
to
get
away
from
everybody
for
a
day
i
have
too
much
of
monica
on
saturdays
as
a
rule
i
an
instinct
it
going
to
be
fine
porthkeverne
had
its
share
of
in
winter
but
it
also
had
its
quota
of
sunshine
and
this
particular
february
day
turned
out
a
foretaste
of
spring
birds
were
singing
everywhere
as
teacher
and
pupil
with
lunch
and
sketching
materials
in
their
satchels
set
off
on
their
tramp
over
the
moors
they
crossed
the
common
where
lorraine
had
stood
among
the
thistles
for
kilmeny
and
came
to
the
little
grey
church
on
the
windy
hill
which
castleton
had
chosen
as
the
scene
for
his
illustrations
to
the
forsaken
merman
the
sound
of
the
organ
came
through
the
open
door
and
peeping
in
lorraine
could
see
golden
hair
gleaming
like
a
saint
halo
in
the
chancel
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
landry
perfect
profile
as
he
sat
listening
in
the
dusty
gallery
shall
we
go
and
speak
to
them
asked
margaret
lindsay
no
said
lorraine
emphatically
i
not
friends
with
morland
he
promised
to
practise
an
accompaniment
with
me
last
night
and
he
never
turned
up
i
shall
just
leave
him
to
himself
he
a
bad
boy
he
has
his
limitations
agreed
margaret
the
breath
of
early
spring
was
in
the
air
as
they
walked
through
the
cluster
of
houses
termed
by
courtesy
the
village
and
climbing
a
stile
took
the
path
along
the
cliffs
on
such
days
the
sap
seems
to
rise
in
human
beings
as
well
as
in
the
vegetable
world
lorraine
literally
danced
along
margaret
lindsay
artist
eyes
were
busy
registering
impressions
of
sunlight
on
pearly
stretches
of
sea
or
effects
of
green
sward
and
grey
rock
in
shadow
the
cornish
coast
in
february
is
perfect
she
decided
and
it
so
delightfully
quiet
heaven
defend
me
from
the
resort
which
is
some
people
idea
of
the
seaside
i
read
the
most
delicious
poem
once
it
began
she
was
a
lady
of
high
degree
a
poor
and
unknown
artist
he
me
she
said
view
of
the
sea
so
he
painted
the
sea
as
it
looked
the
day
when
aphrodite
arose
from
its
spray
and
as
she
gazed
on
its
face
the
while
it
broke
in
its
countless
dimpled
smile
a
poky
stupid
picture
said
she
is
anything
like
the
sea
the
wretched
artist
in
several
more
verses
of
poetry
which
i
forget
paints
the
sea
in
every
possible
effect
of
storm
and
calm
all
to
the
scorn
of
the
lady
who
decides
do
believe
he
paint
the
sea
but
in
desperation
he
makes
a
final
dash
for
her
patronage
probably
poor
man
being
hard
up
so
he
painted
a
stretch
of
hot
brown
sand
with
a
big
hotel
on
either
hand
and
a
handsome
pavilion
for
the
band
not
a
trace
of
the
water
to
be
seen
except
one
faint
little
streak
of
green
a
perfectly
picture
said
she
very
of
the
sea
lorraine
laughed
no
one
can
accuse
tangy
point
of
pavilions
and
big
hotels
we
seem
quite
alone
in
the
world
up
on
these
cliffs
i
have
seen
a
solitary
person
since
we
left
the
village
which
remark
has
instantly
conjured
up
somebody
look
on
the
shore
below
us
no
to
the
left
down
there
i
see
the
flutter
of
a
feminine
skirt
yes
and
masculine
trousers
too
he
getting
out
of
a
boat
and
going
to
speak
to
her
actually
a
kiss
how
touching
they
do
know
that
there
are
spectators
on
the
cliffs
we
must
be
hundreds
of
feet
above
them
they
look
like
specks
i
brought
the
said
lorraine
opening
her
satchel
it
brings
that
couple
as
close
and
clear
as
possible
why
i
know
that
grey
costume
and
that
crimson
toque
it
madame
bertier
as
large
as
life
look
for
yourself
carina
margaret
lindsay
readjusted
the
glasses
to
her
sight
and
focused
them
on
the
figures
below
there
not
a
doubt
about
it
she
pronounced
i
can
almost
hear
her
broken
english
who
the
man
lorraine
stood
frowning
with
concentrated
thought
that
what
is
puzzling
me
his
face
is
so
absolutely
familiar
i
i
seen
him
before
somewhere
and
yet
for
the
life
of
me
i
ca
remember
where
it
one
of
those
aggravating
that
haunt
one
i
like
to
try
throwing
down
a
stone
to
attract
their
attention
i
should
on
any
account
let
leave
them
to
it
and
go
and
find
a
place
to
take
our
sketch
we
shall
lose
this
effect
of
sunshine
if
we
not
quick
madame
bertier
does
interest
me
enough
to
make
me
waste
valuable
time
in
watching
her
flirtations
but
i
wish
i
could
remember
who
the
man
is
ruminated
lorraine
with
knitted
brows
he
certainly
not
worth
bothering
your
head
about
come
along
and

chapter
xii
the
sensation
bureau
look
here
said
vivien
one
day
in
recreation
time
i
think
this
school
a
very
sort
of
show
we
a
set
of
blighters
she
was
sitting
on
a
form
in
the
gymnasium
in
a
decidedly
pessimistic
frame
of
mind
eating
a
piece
of
hard
oatcake
it
as
dry
as
chumping
chaff
she
confided
dismally
i
do
like
my
lunch
in
these
days
of
rations
there
never
even
a
scrap
of
margarine
to
spare
let
alone
butter
groused
audrey
who
was
also
in
a
mood
to
mop
up
sympathy
i
bring
biscuits
every
morning
but
they
not
what
biscuits
used
to
be
nothing
is
what
wrong
with
the
school
though
asked
lorraine
with
somewhat
of
the
irritation
of
a
nurse
when
her
pet
fledgeling
is
unduly
criticized
it
seems
to
be
jogging
along
all
right
as
far
as
i
can
see
there
you
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
exactly
it
jogging
and
i
hate
things
to
jog
i
like
them
to
go
with
a
swing
the
lent
always
as
dull
as
ditch
water
we
have
our
societies
began
lorraine
but
vivien
interrupted
her
impatiently
oh
yes
those
precious
societies
i
know
every
one
was
keen
at
first
and
then
they
slacked
they
always
do
do
talk
to
me
i
blue
are
we
no
jodelled
patsie
throwing
up
her
last
bit
of
biscuit
and
trying
to
catch
it
in
her
mouth
like
a
terrier
i
say
vivien
you
silly
cockchafer
why
do
you
buck
up
if
the
dull
then
for
goodness
sake
do
something
to
make
it
more
lively
instead
of
sitting
and
looking
like
a
dying
duck
in
a
thunderstorm
what
the
muses
do
you
want
something
to
happen
what
an
elopement
a
fire
a
burglary
tell
me
the
sort
of
sensation
you
craving
for
and
we
try
to
accommodate
you
i
going
to

the

sniggered
for
patsie
was
at
what
they
were
wont
to
call
her
patsiest
at
school
she
supplied
the
place
of
public
entertainer
her
favourite
rôle
was
that
of
the
jester
with
cap
and
bells
i
really
got
a
though
she
rattled
on
i
agree
with
viv
things
at
present
are
just
about
as
dull
and
unromantic
as
they
could
possibly
be

do
have
any
fun
as
they
had
in
the
middle
ages
or
even
in

times
my
ran
away
from
school
to
gretna
green
but
it
never
done
now
well
the
next
best
thing
to
real
adventures
is
making
them
up
that
where
my
sensation
bureau
comes
in
here
vivien
pining
for
romance
well
prepared
to
give
it
to
her
hot
and
strong
i
going
to
write
her
a
letter
every
day
from
and
post
it
inside
the
hollow
tree
in
the
garden
she
can
get
and
post
hers
there
too
if
she
likes
will
you
trade
letters
it
be
a
stunt
if
you
write
the
first
agreed
vivien
brightening
up
of
course
your
will
write
first
to
his
little
laughed
patsie
patsie
was
gifted
with
a
most
lively
imagination
and
some
talent
for
writing
her
tastes
ran
on
the
lines
of
cheap
novelettes
she
evolved
a
supposititious
hero
for
vivien
and
began
a
series
of
epistles
couched
in
exceedingly
ardent
terms
all
the
most
extravagant
nonsense
that
she
could
invent
was
scribbled
in
the
letters
which
addressed
simply
to
were
posted
inside
the
hollow
of
an
old
at
the
bottom
of
the
school
garden
vivien
shared
the
effusions
with
her
friends
and
they
had
tremendous
fun
over
them
in
a
corner
of
the
they
helped
her
to
concoct
replies
the
imaginary
romance
afforded
them
extreme
entertainment
it
was
as
exciting
as
writing
a
novel
they
worked
it
through
all
sorts
of
interesting
stages
hope
despair
and
lovers
quarrels
till
it
culminated
in
a
suggested
elopement
patsie
really
outdid
herself
sometimes
in
the
brilliancy
of
her
composition
jack
had
developed
a
floweriness
of
style
and
a
knack
of
describing
his
bold
adventures
that
raised
him
to
the
rank
of
a
cinema
hero
the
girls
used
to
wait
for
his
letters
with
as
keen
an
anticipation
as
for
the
next
number
of
a
serial
vivien
the
fortunate
recipient
of
them
was
envied
several
other
enthusiasts
suggested
opening
a
correspondence
but
patsie
was
adamant
the
sensation
bureau
got
enough
in
this
line
on
its
hands
provide
something
else
for
you
if
you
like
a
shipwreck
or
an
or
a
railway
accident
but
until
those
two
are
safely
i
ca
take
on
any
more
love
affairs
oh
yes
you
can
put
down
your
names
if
you
like
i
a
nice
little
matter
in
my
mind
for
audrey
later
in
the
term
no
i
sha
tell
it
you
now
not
if
you
beg
all
day
the
girls
were
sitting
near
the
stove
in
the
gymnasium
before
afternoon
school
and
munching
some
chocolate
concocted
with
cocoa
and
condensed
milk
like
most
war
substitutes
it
was
not
so
good
as
the
real
thing
but
it
was
certainly
much
better
than
nothing
the
talk
with
several
concerning
eatables
drifted
back
again
to
the
jack
vivien
as
the
heroine
of
the
romance
assumed
an
attitude
of
interesting
importance
she
affected
much
knowledge
of
his
doings
you
never
yet
told
us
exactly
what
he
like
said
nellie
well
of
course
it
difficult
to
describe
him
he
tall
you
know
with
flashing
eyes
and
little
crisp
curls
has
he
a
moustache
n
n
o
not
exactly
a
moustache
vivien
imagination
was
not
nearly
so
ready
as
patsie
he
rather
like
antonio
in
that
piece
they
had
at
the
cinema
last
week
he
flings
money
about
liberally
and
always
jumping
into
a
motor
and
driving
off
very
fast
where
does
he
get
his
petrol
asked
lorraine
oh
it
supplied
by
the
government
he
has
a
simply
enormous
salary
and
private
means
as
well
we
shall
be
rolling
you
know
i
looking
forward
to
having
you
all
staying
with
me
when
we
settle
down
the
circle
beamed
almost
as
if
the
prospect
were
real
where
the
house
enquired
audrey
he
has
several
houses
said
vivien
thoughtfully
checking
them
off
on
her
fingers
a
town
one
of
course
in
the
west
end
a
near
warwick
and
a
place
in
wales
i
believe
there
an
estate
in
ireland
as
well
shall
you
hunt
oh
of
course
i
shall
simply
hunting
we
going
to
talk
over
my
mount
if
the
dear
boy
able
to
turn
up
in
the
excitement
of
these
prospective
plans
vivien
involuntarily
raised
her
voice
the
previous
conversation
had
been
in
subdued
tones
but
her
last
remark
must
have
been
audible
over
half
the
gymnasium
nellie
nudged
her
so
violently
that
her
piece
of
chocolate
fell
to
the
floor
in
turning
to
recover
it
she
noticed
the
cause
of
the
sudden
interruption
miss
janet
was
within
a
few
yards
of
them
turning
over
some
music
by
the
piano
vivien
complexion
assumed
a
dull
beetroot
shade
she
wondered
whether
miss
janet
had
overheard
it
was
impossible
to
go
up
to
her
and
explain
that
they
were
only
pretending
the
mistress
face
was
inscrutable
she
did
not
even
glance
in
their
direction
but
picked
out
two
or
three
songs
from
the
pile
and
walked
away
into
the
house
the
little
circle
broke
up
miss
janet
vicinity
seemed
to
have
put
the
stopper
on
romance
she
was
certainly
not
a
sentimental
person
on
the
following
day
there
was
a
fog
one
of
those
white
which
sometimes
enveloped
porthkeverne
when
everything
was
veiled
in
soft
mist
and
even
the
very
furniture
was
clammy
vivien
whose
throat
was
delicate
came
to
school
with
a
shetland
shawl
across
her
mouth
she
sat
and
coughed
in
the
gymnasium
during
recreation
and
fingered
a
letter
in
her
pocket
it
was
quite
a
fat
letter
and
addressed
to
jack
stanley
esq
if
it
were
so
damp
i
run
down
the
garden
and
post
this
she
said
to
lorraine
i
expect
there
be
one
waiting
for
me
in
the
tree
but
i
promised
mother
i
would
do
anything
silly
and
i
suppose
it
be
silly
to
run
down
the
wet
garden
in
my
thin
shoes
and
without
my
coat
it
would
be
absolutely
cracked
with
that
cough
i
go
give
me
your
letter
it
was
part
of
the
procedure
of
the
romance
that
the
correspondence
must
be
deposited
inside
the
hollow
tree
or
else
on
wet
days
it
would
certainly
have
been
far
simpler
to
hand
over
the
notes
in
school
vivien
had
once
hinted
this
but
patsie
stuck
firmly
to
her
plans
and
as
she
was
the
originator
of
the
whole
scheme
she
had
the
right
to
make
the
arrangements
letters
will
be
found
in
the
garden
and
nowhere
else
she
decreed
so
lorraine
who
was
sufficiently
interested
to
want
to
hear
the
next
instalment
supplied
by
patsie
fertile
imagination
ran
out
into
the
fog
and
among
the
dripping
bushes
down
the
path
that
edged
the
lawn
the
was
moist
and
earwiggy
she
wetted
and
soiled
her
sleeve
by
reaching
down
into
it
at
the
bottom
in
company
with
a
fat
spider
and
several
woodlice
lay
a
letter
addressed
in
a
bold
hand
to
my
she
exchanged
it
for
vivien
epistle
and
scudded
off
through
the
damp
mist
back
to
the
gymnasium
if
any
eyes
were
watching
as
she
passed
the
study
window
and
came
in
by
the
side
door
it
was
much
too
foggy
for
her
to
see
clearly
as
she
handed
the
letter
to
her
waiting
cousin
she
noticed
that
the
envelope
was
not
gummed
down
securely
hallo
been
in
a
hurry
with
this
she
commented
it
properly
stuck
perhaps
it
the
damp
that
melted
the
gum
said
vivien
pulling
out
the
contents
impatiently
jack
correspondence
though
addressed
to
her
was
common
property
several
heads
bent
over
the
sheet
eager
for
what
might
be
termed
the
next
episode
of
the
romance
the
letter
was
dated
the
grand
hotel
and
began
my
own
darlingest
it
is
hours
since
i
last
wrote
to
you
and
the
time
has
seemed
an
eternity
how
i
manage
to
live
without
your
presence
i
can
not
imagine
life
apart
from
you
is
a
blank
wilderness
i
wander
by
the
sad
sea
waves
and
were
it
not
for
the
fond
hope
of
meeting
you
again
i
should
cast
myself
into
them
and
perish
my
ownest
own
i
can
stand
this
misery
no
longer
surely
the
clouds
that
have
separated
us
may
now
be
blown
apart
and
again
i
can
bask
in
the
sunshine
of
your
smile
if
you
can
forgive
me
meet
me
alone
at
twilight
in
the
old
familiar
spot
on
the
beach
that
hallowed
place
where
we
first
gazed
into
each
other
eyes
and
vowed
fidelity
i
have
a
plan
to
propose
but
i
dare
not
write
it
i
must
tell
it
to
you
in
words
and
beg
for
your
favour
on
my
knees
i
shall
be
there
awaiting
your
approach
with
burning
anxiety
and
longing
to
clasp
you
in
these
fond
arms

all
the
love

wide
world

devoted

said
claudia
who
was
working
monitress
for
the
week
and
whose
duty
it
was
to
collect
the
and
give
them
to
miss
kingsley
do
be
all
day
about
it
i
in
a
hurry
here
mine
answered
lorraine
and
do
you
mind
giving
this
note
to
morland
it
a
list
of
pieces
by
that
new
russian
composer
vladi
something
ski
rosemary
sent
it
for
him
right
you
are
said
claudia
he
mad
on
russian
music
just
at
present
the
bell
rang
at
that
moment
and
the
girls
trooped
upstairs
to
their
they
had
taken
their
seats
and
miss
turner
was
just
in
the
act
of
opening
her
latin
book
when
miss
janet
came
bustling
in
miss
janet
moods
varied
this
morning
the
corners
of
her
mouth
were
tucked
in
and
her
eyes
were
inscrutable
the
form
instantly
set
her
mental
register
at
stormy
stand
up
girls
she
commanded
briskly
move
from
your
desks
and
form
into
line
over
there
facing
me
exceedingly
astonished
the
form
obeyed
now
each
of
you
turn
up
your
feet
so
as
to
show
me
the
soles
of
your
shoes
right
first
then
left
thank
you
lorraine
whose
shoes
are
damp
will
go
downstairs
and
change
into
her
gymnasium
shoes
the
rest
may
take
their
seats
very
much
mystified
the
girls
returned
to
their
desks
miss
janet
departed
and
lorraine
ran
down
to
effect
the
required
change
she
could
not
understand
miss
janet
fussy
solicitude
for
her
health
she
did
not
remember
that
the
form
had
ever
been
examined
thus
for
damp
feet
she
could
only
conclude
that
miss
janet
who
was
apt
to
take
sudden
whims
had
been
studying
a
treatise
on
hygiene
at
eleven
she
had
a
further
surprise
miss
paget
brought
her
a
message
telling
her
to
report
herself
to
miss
kingsley
in
the
study
wondering
what
was
the
matter
she
answered
the
summons
at
once
she
found
miss
kingsley
and
miss
janet
sitting
together
at
the
table
with
trouble
writ
large
on
their
faces
the
mental
atmosphere
of
the
room
cut
her
like
a
knife
it
was
so
unmistakably
hostile
lorraine
began
miss
kingsley
sternly
i
sent
for
you
to
ask
you
a
straight
question
and
i
expect
a
straight
answer
did
you
bring
to
school
a
letter
addressed
to
er
a
member
of
the
opposite
sex
utterly
amazed
lorraine
hesitated
then
remembering
her
note
to
morland
replied
yes
miss
kingsley
she
wondered
how
the
head
mistress
had
got
to
know
about
it
had
claudia
been
so
careless
as
to
leave
it
inside
her
miss
kingsley
glance
was
hypnotic
in
its
intensity
the
corners
of
miss
janet
mouth
twitched
nervously
i
glad
you
are
candid
enough
to
confess
it
though
i
have
ample
proof
against
you
lorraine
you
whom
i
chose
as
head
girl
and
leader
for
the
rest
of
the
school
i
never
been
so
bitterly
disappointed
in
anybody
miss
kingsley
voice
trembled
as
she
spoke
you
might
at
least
have
the
grace
to
look
ashamed
of
yourself
added
miss
janet
lorraine
was
staggered
but
not
ashamed
she
could
not
see
that
the
occasion
warranted
such
sweeping
condemnation
it
was
a
very
harmless
letter
she
began
in
harmless
blazed
miss
kingsley
if
this
is
your
idea
of
correspondence
i
disgusted
with
you
i
call
it
most
i
do
know
what
modern
girls
are
coming
to
echoed
miss
janet
in
young
days
they
held
very
different
standards
it
will
be
my
duty
continued
miss
kingsley
grimly
to
inform
your
mother
of
this
disgraceful
correspondence
but
mother
knows
gasped
lorraine
she
knows
yes
she
saw
me
write
the
letter
did
she
read
it
no
she
did
ask
to
is
she
aware
what
you
wrote
in
it
i
expect
so
lorraine
i
ca
believe
you
i
know
forrester
too
well
to
imagine
that
she
would
allow
you
to
carry
on
such
a
clandestine
correspondence
as
this
but
mother
morland
persisted
lorraine
and
i
to
write
to
him
to
send
him
rosemary
list
of
pieces
she
asked
me
to
let
him
have
them
soon
miss
kingsley
looked
frankly
puzzled
morland
she
said
inquiringly
the
letter
is
addressed
to
an
individual
named
then
a
great
light
broke
across
lorraine
in
her
relief
she
almost
laughed
her
suppressed
chuckle
was
fortunately
taken
for
a
subdued
sob
oh
miss
kingsley
she
cried
did
you
get
the
letter
out
of
the
hollow
tree
the
head
mistress
nodded
gravely
then
it
all
a
mistake
it
was
written
to
anybody
real
it
was
only
a
little
bit
of
fun
we
had
among
ourselves
pa
i
mean
one
of
us
made
up
and
wrote
his
letters
and
another
of
us
answered
them
it
was
only
nonsense
did
you
write
this
asked
miss
janet
grimly
handing
a
sheet
of
across
the
table
it
was
in
vivien
handwriting
which
bore
a
strong
resemblance
to
lorraine
own
and
it
was
couched
in
terms
strong
enough
certainly
to
rouse
a
flutter
in
the
breast
of
a
careful
schoolmistress
it
mourned
jack
absence
referred
to
turtle
doves
cupid
arrows
and
other
tender
things
thanked
him
for
handsome
presents
and
looked
forward
rapturously
to
the
next
meeting
with
him
it
ended
with
fondest
love
and
was
signed
your
little
no
i
did
write
it
answered
lorraine
then
who
did
lorraine
hesitated
as
it
was
only
a
joke
will
you
please
excuse
my
not
answering
it
does
seem
quite
fair
to
give
anybody
else
away
the
whole
form
were
in
it
really
miss
kingsley
fixed
her
with
a
glance
which
lorraine
afterwards
described
as
that
of
a
then
she
summed
up
as
you
all
seem
to
have
been
equally
foolish
i
let
the
matter
stand
at
that
but
i
wish
to
say
that
i
never
in
my
life
read
more
perfectly
idiotic
senseless
worthless
than
is
contained
in
these
silly
letters
and
if
that
your
idea
of
amusement
i
sorry
for
you
i
should
have
thought
that
lorraine
would
have
been
above
such
nonsense
and
would
have
used
your
influence
to
interest
the
girls
in
something
more
sensible
these
letters
must
be
stopped
at
once
i
distinctly
forbid
anything
more
of
the
sort
and
you
may
tell
the
others
so
do
you
understand
miss
kingsley
as
she
spoke
tore
latest
effusion
into
shreds
and
threw
the
bits
into
the
basket
a
very
dejected
and
indignant
sixth
form
listened
to
lorraine
account
of
the
interview
miss
janet
must
have
fished
some
of
the
letters
out
of
that
tree
and
read
them
and
put
them
back
what
a
sneaking
trick
of
her
and
she
thought
it
was
you
because
you
got
your
feet
wet
sporting
of
her
to
examine
our
shoes
it
like
sherlock
holmes
sporting
i
call
it
disgusting
is
poor
darling
to
write
again
to
his
little
demanded
vivien
with
a
note
of
tragedy
in
her
voice
we
better
drown
him
or
kill
him
at
the
front
or
let
him
die
suddenly
of
pneumonia
said
patsie
sadly
then
you
can
look
decently
sorry
for
a
while
it
really
too
bad
just
when
i
was
working
up
so
nicely
for
the
elopement
he
was
buying
a
new
car
on
purpose
never
mind
i
write
a
novel
some
day
when
i
left
school
and
i
put
all
the
letters
in
every
scrap
of
them
and
when
it
published
send
a
copy
of
it
to
miss
janet
oh
thrilled
the
excited
circle
she
say
dear
girl
i
always
said
she
was
clever
and
would
turn
out
a
famous
authoress
people
generally
say
afterwards
that
they
said
oh
patsie
it
be
so
delightful
do
begin
it
soon
not
till
i
leave
school
and
that
a
whole
term
and
a
half
off
with
the
easter
holidays
thrown
in

have
to
wait
chapter

rosemary
secret
the
fresh
year
flew
on
wings
the
snowdrops
fair
maids
of
february
faded
in
the
school
garden
and
their
pale
ethereal
blossoms
were
replaced
by
golden
daffodils
that
seemed
to
reflect
the
stronger
sunshine
mezereon
and
other
fragrant
shrubs
put
out
flowers
and
the
great
white
arum
lilies
were
throwing
up
their
sheaths
violets
and
early
primroses
might
be
searched
for
under
sheltered
hedgerows
and
the
japanese
were
bursting
into
bud
mother
nature
seemed
to
be
shaking
her
garments
and
getting
ready
for
the
great
carnival
of
spring
with
the
longer
days
lorraine
was
often
up
at
windy
howe
it
was
the
sort
of
household
where
you
could
arrive
at
any
time
without
presenting
an
apology
for
your
intrusion
you
must
take
us
just
as
you
find
us
said
claudia
you
know
i
glad
to
see
you
lorraine
but
i
sha
treat
you
as
a
visitor
and
have
you
shown
into
the
you
do
mind
claudia
was
sitting
in
the
nursery
rocking
the
latest
addition
to
the
castleton
family
a
tiny
white
bundle
with
golden
down
on
its
pink
head
she
nursed
it
dutifully
patting
its
back
with
the
experience
gained
with
seven
other
younger
brothers
and
sisters
yes
it
rather
sweet
she
agreed
in
answer
to
a
comment
from
lorraine
i
like
them
all
right
if
they
did
cry
so
much
it
such
a
nuisance
when
they
perpetually
squalling
the
fact
is
i
fed
up
with
children
i
never
seem
able
to
get
away
from
them
here
i
the
greatest
difficulty
in
doing
my
home
lessons
violet
always
asking
me
to
take
the
baby
or
perugia
and
lilith
and
constable
are
generally
tearing
about
somewhere
to
say
nothing
of
beata
and
romola
and
madox
lorraine
i
made
up
my
mind
i
seventeen
now
and
leaving
school
this
summer
i
going
to
stay
at
home
and
just
help
with
the
children
it
is
good
enough
what
would
you
like
to
do
asked
lorraine
watching
with
sympathy
while
her
friend
made
another
effort
to
soothe
the
obstreperous
new
little
brother
to
sleep
i
do
know
said
claudia
forlornly
i
do
seem
good
for
anything
except
to
do
odd
jobs
perhaps
i
go
on
the
land
it
would
be
a
change
to
make
hay
and
hoe
turnips
i
should
be
away
from
violet
anyhow
been
squabbling
again
dreadfully
of
late
i
ca
stand
it
much
longer
if
morland
called
up
i
going
off
too
i
do
care
where
she
spoke
resentfully
almost
desperately
lorraine
had
not
seen
her
in
such
a
mood
before
she
had
sometimes
guessed
that
her
friend
was
not
altogether
happy
at
home
though
until
she
had
never
received
such
a
big
slice
of
claudia
confidence
could
you
go
to
college
or
to
study
something
she
suggested
vaguely
the
baby
was
crying
so
lustily
that
conversation
was
difficult
claudia
remarks
were
punctuated
by
the
regular
of
the
rockers
on
her
chair
i
asked
father
but
it
no
use
he
wo
send
me
he
says
beata
and
romola
turn
now
and
they
must
go
to
school
horrid
i
just
hate
it
all
the
baby
lifting
up
a
despairing
wail
also
protested
against
the
evils
of
existence
poor
little
man
he
does
like
life
either
soothed
claudia
there
there
are
his
toes
cold
sissie
warm
them
for
him
it
no
use
i
shall
have
to
take
him
to
violet
and
she
trying
to
write
letters
this
little
peep
behind
the
scenes
at
windy
howe
made
lorraine
feel
worried
about
claudia
the
next
time
she
went
to
the
studio
by
the
harbour
she
talked
the
matter
over
margaret
lindsay
knew
the
castleton
family
so
well
that
she
might
be
counted
upon
for
advice
claudia
simply
fed
up
explained
lorraine
it
partly
the
children
but
principally
violet
i
do
think
i
should
like
to
live
with
violet
myself
perhaps
not
yet
she
has
her
good
points
on
the
whole
i
think
very
decent
to
all
those
with
her
own
little
tribe
as
well
it
must
be
difficult
to
manage
the
household
but
i
sympathize
with
claudia
when
she
leaves
school
i
sure
it
will
be
far
the
best
plan
for
her
to
go
away
from
home
for
a
while
but
her
father
wo
let
her
suppose
she
could
win
a
scholarship
i
fancy
that
would
smooth
the
way
oh
do
you
think
she
could
suppose
you
ask
miss
kingsley
if
she
can
suggest
any
career
for
claudia
she
sure
to
be
interested
in
her
pupils
plans
for
the
future
i
certainly
think
it
a
shame
for
the
girl
to
be
kept
at
home
acting
nursemaid
to
the
younger
ones
i
willingly
tackle
castleton
some
day
and
have
a
little
talk
with
him
about
claudia
if
there
any
plan
to
propose
i
knew
her
own
mother
so
that
gives
me
a
pull
speak
to
violet
too
i
dare
say
she
be
quite
nice
about
it
oh
carina
i
wish
you
would
i
think
claudia
has
a
wretched
time
do
you
know
the
children
got
hold
of
the
album
i
gave
her
for
her
birthday
and
they
scribbled
all
over
it
and
violet
did
even
scold
them
was
it
trying
she
lets
them
scramble
about
everywhere
and
do
what
they
like
claudia
so
worried
she
says
her
hair
beginning
to
fall
out
i
did
know
her
hair
was
falling
out
she
better
cut
it
short
in
that
case
she
must
on
any
account
let
that
lovely
hair
be
neglected
miss
kingsley
on
being
appealed
to
was
deeply
interested
she
talked
things
over
with
miss
janet
and
they
came
at
once
to
a
conclusion
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
a
good
kindergarten
training
there
were
several
open
scholarships
for
a
kindergarten
college
whose
principal
was
an
intimate
friend
of
theirs
they
would
write
about
it
at
once
and
claudia
must
go
in
for
the
examination
they
would
make
a
point
of
coaching
her
specially
in
their
minds
the
whole
matter
was
already
decided
it
would
be
a
splendid
chance
for
the
girl
so
they
said
that
wise
old
greek
slave
æsop
who
knew
human
nature
so
well
that
his
fables
are
as
true
to
life
now
as
they
were
two
thousand
years
ago
tells
the
story
of
a
king
who
wished
to
fortify
his
castle
he
asked
advice
and
the
mason
recommended
bricks
the
carpenter
wood
and
the
tanner
leather
each
thought
his
own
trade
supreme
the
misses
kingsley
were
perfectly
sure
that
claudia
who
was
experienced
with
children
would
succeed
admirably
in
kindergarten
work
they
even
saw
visions
of
her
being
established
some
day
at
the
gables
in
the
capacity
of
a
mistress
claudia
on
being
introduced
to
her
future
prospects
gasped
a
little
she
acquiesced
but
did
not
look
quite
as
grateful
as
her
friends
had
anticipated
i
get
away
from
home
at
any
rate
and
that
would
be
something
was
all
she
would
say
to
lorraine
it
would
be
a
career
said
lorraine
fresh
from
a
brainy
bracing
talk
with
miss
janet
once
you
got
your
training
you
be
independent
and
able
to
earn
your
own
living
um
yes
claudia
spoke
without
enthusiasm
i
wonder
what
the
college
would
be
like
jolly
hard
work
i
expect
miss
janet
says
it
adorable
oh
there
are
several
scholarships
i
wish
you
go
in
for
one
and
come
too
then
we
should
be
together
it
was
lorraine
turn
to
look
blank
it
is
one
thing
to
recommend
a
vocation
to
a
friend
and
quite
another
to
take
it
up
yourself
viewed
from
her
own
standpoint
the
joys
of
a
kindergarten
training
did
not
seem
so
attractive
she
began
to
wonder
whether
miss
janet
had
overstated
them
and
the
delights
of
independence
i
i
do
know
yet
whether
i
want
to
leave
home
and
if
i
do
going
to
study
art
she
stammered
lamely
i
wish
i
could
study
music
but
there
not
the
faintest
little
atom
of
a
chance
of
doing
that
returned
claudia
bitterly
nevertheless
at
miss
kingsley
insistence
she
set
to
work
diligently
to
read
up
for
the
open
scholarship
examination
miss
janet
kindly
coached
her
and
gave
up
many
hours
of
leisure
on
her
behalf
claudia
was
quite
clever
at
lessons
when
she
chose
to
apply
herself
the
progress
she
made
under
this
private
tuition
delighted
miss
janet
miss
kingsley
wrote
fully
to
her
friend
the
principal
of
the
college
and
received
a
most
encouraging
reply
the
girl
you
mention
seems
just
the
kind
of
student
we
wish
to
procure
at
present
wrote
miss
halden
i
am
allowed
a
certain
liberty
of
selection
and
so
long
as
a
candidate
marks
do
not
fall
below
a
given
standard
i
may
make
my
own
choice
i
am
not
necessarily
obliged
to
award
the
scholarships
to
those
who
send
in
the
best
papers
but
to
those
who
after
a
personal
interview
i
consider
would
in
the
end
make
the
most
successful
teachers
there
are
other
qualifications
to
consider
besides
examination
points
charm
of
manner
is
an
extremely
valuable
asset
in
dealing
with
children
and
i
would
rather
train
a
girl
who
is
gifted
with
imagination
and
tact
than
the
most
erudite
student
who
is
deficient
in
these
necessary
qualities
if
claudia
castleton
is
what
you
say
and
you
can
coach
her
sufficiently
to
gain
a
pass
i
think
she
may
be
almost
sure
of
a
scholarship
the
misses
kingsley
were
most
excited
at
the
receipt
of
this
letter
they
did
not
tell
claudia
its
full
contents
for
fear
she
might
slack
off
work
but
they
could
not
help
throwing
out
hints
it
something
to
have
friends
at
court
beamed
miss
janet
as
she
put
on
her
and
took
her
pupil
for
latin
construction
you
see
we
know
miss
halden
so
very
well
i
fancy
there
luck
in
store
for
you
claudia
yes
said
claudia
dolefully
as
she
looked
up
a
last
word
in
the
dictionary
margaret
lindsay
had
taken
the
opportunity
of
a
visit
to
the
studio
at
windy
howe
to
speak
to
castleton
on
the
subject
of
the
possible
scholarship
he
was
busy
painting
at
the
time
and
far
more
interested
in
the
proper
perspective
of
his
background
than
in
his
future
prospects
he
agreed
abstractedly
with
anything
that
was
suggested
if
they
give
her
a
free
training
let
her
go
by
all
means
do
you
think
that
pearly
grey
throws
the
cliff
into
relief
i
no
doubt
miss
kingsley
right
i
think
that
is
an
improvement
yes
getting
a
big
girl
i
suppose
i
had
made
the
cliff
darker
but
i
like
the
sun
on
it
the
children
grow
up
so
fast
i
glad
you
like
that
shade
of
brown
under
the
rock
because
i
consider
it
brings
out
the
whole
picture
young
pretty
castleton
on
being
appealed
to
burst
into
tragic
tears
i
sure
do
want
to
stand
in
the
girl
light
she
sobbed
if
it
the
right
thing
for
her
to
leave
home
i
suppose
she
must
but
nobody
need
say
turned
her
out
i
should
have
thought
it
would
be
any
more
fun
teaching
kindergarten
than
helping
to
look
after
her
own
brothers
and
sisters
however
that
a
matter
of
opinion
and
always
tried
to
do
my
best
by
my
husband
children
but
it
small
thanks
one
gets
for
it
all
the
examination
for
the
scholarship
was
to
be
held
in
london
and
candidates
were
required
to
fill
up
beforehand
certain
papers
of
application
and
forward
them
to
the
college
the
forms
arrived
on
the
very
last
day
of
term
miss
janet
summoned
claudia
to
the
study
and
gave
them
to
her
they
must
be
signed
by
your
father
she
explained
and
you
must
post
them
not
later
than
the
sixth
the
envelope
is
already
addressed
and
my
sister
and
i
have
filled
in
our
part
of
the
application
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
get
castleton
signature
when
miss
halden
receives
these
papers
she
will
send
you
a
card
of
admission
for
the
examination
that
will
not
be
for
three
weeks
so
i
shall
see
you
again
before
you
have
to
go
up
to
london
be
sure
to
go
on
with
your
work
during
the
holidays
and
give
special
attention
to
latin
grammar
yes
miss
janet
said
claudia
dutifully
taking
the
large
envelope
and
slipping
it
into
her
coat
pocket
post
it
urged
miss
janet
as
she
dismissed
her
pupil
from
the
study
the
advent
of
easter
saw
rosemary
again
at
porthkeverne
she
not
only
returned
for
the
holidays
but
came
back
for
good
the
secret
which
had
haunted
and
puzzled
lorraine
since
christmas
was
out
at
last
rosemary
had
written
home
and
told
the
plain
unvarnished
brutal
truth
signor
arezzo
says
it
no
use
my
going
on
he
never
be
able
to
make
anything
of
my
voice
i
been
at
the
coll
two
terms
and
tried
my
best
but
he
says
it
futile
i
only
fit
to
warble
in
a
small
to
friends
who
are
not
and
it
a
waste
of
money
to
stop
on
here
this
was
indeed
a
blow
it
was
a
very
crushed
disappointed
miserable
little
rosemary
who
returned
to
the
bosom
of
her
bewildered
family
at
first
they
would
not
believe
the
severe
decision
and
passed
through
the
stages
of
denial
indignation
and
annoyance
to
realization
and
resignation
it
is
so
very
humiliating
to
find
out
that
your
swan
about
whom
you
have
cackled
so
proudly
turns
out
to
be
only
an
ordinary
domestic
bird
after
all
evidently
the
first
thing
to
be
done
was
to
comfort
rosemary
she
needed
it
badly
she
went
about
the
house
a
pathetic
little
figure
with
big
wistful
eyes
i
muvvie
she
sobbed
in
confidence
never
mind
darling
we
want
you
at
home
if
they
do
want
you
at
the
college
you
can
go
in
for
work
and
help
at
the
red
cross
hospital
it
delightful
for
me
to
have
my
daughter
back
you
know
how
i
shall
appreciate
your
company
but
i
feel
i
such
a
failure
not
at
all
you
simply
have
slipped
into
your
right
niche
yet
people
sometimes
make
bad
shots
before
they
find
their
vocations
cheer
up
your
singing
is
a
great
pleasure
to
us
if
it
not
fit
for
a
concert
platform
i
never
want
to
sing
another
note
in
all
my
life
declared
rosemary
little
by
little
details
of
the
tragedy
leaked
out
lorraine
heard
many
of
them
sitting
on
her
sister
bed
while
rosemary
ruefully
unpacked
the
boxes
of
music
and
the
and
all
the
other
treasured
trifles
she
had
taken
to
the
college
he
says
i
have
the
physique
for
a
singer
i
not
got
enough
in
my
lungs
you
should
see
maudie
canning
his
favourite
pupil
she
has
the
most
enormous
chest
and
such
a
throat
just
look
at
mine
rosemary
was
examining
herself
in
the
glass
as
she
spoke
it
stands
to
reason
if
an
organ
has
proper
pipes
and
bellows
it
ca
sound
you
want
such
a
big
voice
to
fill
a
but
could
you
go
on
with
music
just
for
yourself
signor
arezzo
does
care
to
bother
with
amateurs
his
time
is
so
valuable
that
he
gives
it
all
to
promising
students
only
no
i
quite
made
up
my
mind
never
to
sing
again
do
argue
with
me
it
no
use
and
only
makes
me
feel
irritable
i
tell
you
i
it
was
terrible
to
have
rosemary
in
such
a
disconsolate
mood
it
seemed
to
throw
a
blight
over
the
whole
family
lorraine
was
immensely
concerned
in
her
trouble
she
turned
instinctively
to
the
studio
by
the
harbour
margaret
lindsay
who
herself
had
weathered
many
troubles
was
an
expert
in
the
art
of
comfort
rosemary
heart
is
broken
said
lorraine
tragically
sitting
on
the
in
the
sunshine
and
squeezing
her
friend
arm
poor
child
tell
her
that
some
of
the
best
things
in
the
world
have
been
done
on
broken
hearts
she
very
young
yet
and
i
sure
wanted
at
home
that
what
mother
says
and
perhaps
she
might
have
liked
public
singing
it
is
all
applause
and
bouquets
i
know
several
professionals
and
they
talk
of
long
weary
railway
journeys
and
uncomfortable
hotels
and
many
disagreeables
that
show
a
very
shady
lining
to
the
life
somehow
i
can
far
more
easily
fancy
little
rosemary
happily
married
and
settled
down
in
a
home
of
her
own
than
touring
about
to
concerts
you
must
let
her
give
up
her
singing
she
make
a
most
delightful
amateur
she
scorns
the
word
she
feeling
sore
at
present
but
she
get
over
that
stage
i
hope
i
not
sure
if
an
amateur
has
infinitely
the
best
of
it
i
often
wish
i
were
an
amateur
artist
you
skim
the
cream
in
the
matter
of
enjoyment
without
any
of
the
responsibility
in
six
months
i
hope
rosemary
will
think
differently
and
will
be
the
star
of
the
musical
parties
at
porthkeverne
if
she
ca
shine
on
the
stage
it
a
for
her
all
the
same
groaned
lorraine
i
wish
she
could
marry
a
duke
but
no
dukes
ever
come
to
porthkeverne
perhaps
she
wo
marry
at
all
some
of
the
nicest
people
i
know
have
married
margaret
lindsay
looked
out
far
away
over
the
dancing
gleaming
water
before
she
answered
lorraine
could
not
see
the
shadow
in
her
eyes
sometimes
it
the
person
whom
you
marry
whom
you
love
the
most
the
beautiful
ideal
is
never
shattered
by
the
actual
it
stays
up
in
the
clouds
always
instead
of
trailing
down
to
earth
lorraine
was
lost
in
contemplation
of
her
sister
future
prospects
if
she
does
marry
she
have
to
brace
up
and
go
in
for
some
other
vocation
she
decided
miss
kingsley
says
one
ought
to
look
years
ahead
but
somehow
i
ca
imagine
rosemary
ever
being
it
an
art
to
grow
grey
gracefully

chapter
xiv
what
happened
at
easter
in
spite
of
her
real
concern
for
rosemary
disappointment
lorraine
enjoyed
the
easter
holidays
there
was
much
to
be
done
in
them
morland
and
claudia
were
anxious
to
revisit
the
grotto
which
had
been
neglected
during
the
winter
so
with
landry
in
attendance
they
chose
a
fine
day
and
had
another
delightful
picnic
there
fortunately
the
tides
had
not
reached
as
high
as
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
their
furniture
was
undisturbed
even
the
shell
patterns
remained
as
formerly
though
the
was
brown
and
shrivelled
that
was
a
matter
easily
remedied
however
for
the
rock
pools
below
were
full
of
pink
and
green
algæ
and
corallines
beautiful
enough
for
a
bouquet
it
would
be
a
ripping
place
for
a
hermit
said
morland
i
expect
it
beats
a
hollow
i
shall
often
think
of
it
when
i
called
up
me
go
to
the
war
too
said
landry
suddenly
he
spoke
so
seldom
that
claudia
turned
in
surprise
no
landry
dear
i
could
spare
you
but
morland
going
all
the
more
reason
why
you
should
stay
at
home
and
take
care
of
me
me
want
to
be
with
you
said
landry
fretfully
but
that
ca
be
the
government
will
send
papers
and
then
morland
will
have
to
go
there
was
trouble
in
the
boy
blue
eyes
his
poor
dull
brain
seemed
to
be
making
a
supreme
effort
to
understand
he
spoke
again
still
in
the
language
of
a
little
child
landry
will
take
the
nasty
papers
and
hide
them
and
then
morland
stay
at
home
no
no
dear
landry
could
do
that
laughed
claudia
fondling
his
hand
you
must
be
my
good
boy
and
look
after
me
when
he
gone
landry
relapsed
once
more
into
his
habitual
silence
but
it
was
evident
that
a
new
and
unusual
access
of
thought
was
stirring
in
his
feeble
mind
he
kept
looking
at
morland
with
awakened
interest
lorraine
watching
wondered
what
was
the
result
of
his
cogitations
his
own
sister
and
brother
accustomed
to
his
moods
took
no
more
notice
of
an
occurrence
that
seemed
trivial
at
the
moment
but
afterwards
bore
unexpected
fruit
when
we
made
the
cave
so
nice
it
seems
almost
a
pity
to
keep
it
to
ourselves
suggested
morland
after
a
pause
why
but
we
all
pledged
ourselves
to
absolute
secrecy
i
know
we
did
whom
do
you
want
to
bring
here
enquired
claudia
suspiciously
oh
nobody
in
particular
only
madame
bertier
was
asking
me
one
day
if
there
were
any
caves
along
the
coast
i
thought
she
like
to
see
this
one
you
not
to
bring
that
russian
woman
here
i
do
like
her
i
hope
you
did
not
tell
her
about
it
of
course
not
honest
injun
crystal
clear
i
did
it
secret
and
is
to
know
said
claudia
still
ruffled
let
us
all
take
a
sort
of
oath
right
oh
sha
break
it
agreed
lorraine
emphatically
will
you
swear
morland
urged
claudia
who
going
to
tell
asked
morland
huffily
what
a
fuss
you
girls
make
about
nothing
the
cave
might
be
full
of
diamonds
instead
of
only
shells
only
shells
indeed
claudia
tone
was
belligerent
i
wish
you
both
help
me
to
collect
some
shells
put
in
lorraine
trying
to
patch
up
peace
i
want
some
more
desperately
badly
for
the
museum
a
duty
which
lorraine
had
undertaken
during
the
holidays
was
the
arrangement
of
the
school
museum
she
was
the
curator
but
during
term
time
she
was
so
fully
occupied
that
she
had
never
been
able
to
sort
and
label
the
specimens
which
the
girls
had
brought
to
her
the
whole
collection
had
been
so
far
stored
away
in
boxes
now
however
miss
kingsley
had
set
apart
special
premises
for
the
museum
there
was
an
unused
room
at
the
gables
that
in
the
days
of
former
tenants
had
been
occupied
by
the
coachman
it
adjoined
the
house
but
was
approached
by
an
outside
staircase
from
the
yard
it
had
been
filled
with
lumber
but
miss
kingsley
had
had
this
cleared
away
the
floor
had
been
scrubbed
and
some
old
desks
moved
in
to
serve
as
cases
for
the
specimens
miss
kingsley
and
miss
janet
had
gone
away
for
easter
and
the
servants
were
also
taking
a
rest
the
gables
therefore
was
shut
up
for
the
holidays
though
the
charwoman
who
lived
in
a
cottage
close
by
went
in
to
scrub
and
clean
before
leaving
miss
kingsley
had
given
lorraine
the
key
of
the
museum
so
that
she
might
enter
it
when
she
wished
quite
independently
of
going
to
the
house
lorraine
spent
very
happy
mornings
there
sometimes
alone
sometimes
with
claudia
to
help
her
with
the
aid
of
natural
history
books
from
the
school
library
she
identified
and
labelled
the
specimens
to
the
best
of
her
ability
it
was
a
quiet
kind
of
work
that
appealed
to
her
she
felt
that
the
room
was
going
to
be
a
tremendous
acquisition
to
the
school
all
sorts
of
treasures
could
find
a
home
on
the
walls
secure
from
the
meddlesome
fingers
of
juniors
she
intended
to
keep
it
as
a
sort
of
sanctum
for
the
monitresses
and
had
visions
of
holding
committee
meetings
there
and
bringing
tea
in
thermos
flasks
one
morning
she
had
arranged
to
spend
a
little
time
at
the
museum
and
to
meet
claudia
who
had
promised
to
come
and
help
her
the
was
the
old
windmill
and
lorraine
stood
there
waiting
claudia
was
late
the
castleton
family
were
always
late
for
everything
and
lorraine
walked
impatiently
up
and
down
the
road
footsteps
coming
round
the
corner
made
her
turn
expectantly
to
her
surprise
the
was
not
her
friend
but
her
uncle
barton
forrester
why
uncle
she
exclaimed
what
are
you
doing
up
here
i
thought
you
were
so
busy
at
the
office
so
i
am
and
i
ought
to
be
at
work
now
this
is
what
comes
of
being
a
special
constable
there
a
pretty
the
telephone
wires
have
been
cut
and
the
job
is
to
discover
the
telephone
wires
cut
echoed
lorraine
but
who
has
cut
them
some
spy
i
suppose
one
has
constantly
to
be
on
the
lookout
for
treachery
especially
in
a
place
like
this
if
we
could
only
find
out
where
the
leakage
is
there
lorraine
i
ca
stay
i
got
to
see
jermyn
immediately
uncle
barton
busy
energetic
little
man
that
he
was
waved
his
hand
to
his
niece
and
hurried
away
up
the
road
just
as
claudia
also
in
a
hurry
turned
the
corner
lorraine
cut
short
her
apologies
with
the
news
about
the
telephone
wires
it
means
she
explained
that
until
they
find
the
place
and
can
mend
it
porthkeverne
cut
off
by
telephone
from
all
other
places
you
may
depend
upon
it
as
uncle
says
there
some
treachery
at
the
bottom
of
this
is
it
horrible
to
think
that
there
may
be
spies
in
the
town
ready
to
betray
one
country
dreadful
shuddered
claudia
they
ought
to
intern
everyone
who
the
least
bit
under
suspicion
the
two
girls
walked
rapidly
to
the
gables
and
went
into
the
and
up
the
outside
staircase
lorraine
had
the
key
in
her
pocket
and
unlocked
the
museum
directly
she
entered
she
noticed
that
the
room
was
not
as
she
had
left
it
some
of
the
desks
and
boxes
had
certainly
been
moved
she
remembered
exactly
how
she
had
placed
them
yesterday
her
first
thought
was
that
jones
the
charwoman
must
have
been
in
to
clean
but
that
was
clearly
impossible
for
she
herself
had
the
key
who
could
have
intruded
into
the
sanctum
and
for
what
reason
she
discussed
it
with
claudia
it
gave
them
both
a
most
uncanny
feeling
to
think
that
someone
had
been
able
to
enter
the
gables
was
practically
shut
up
had
a
burglar
been
picking
the
locks
during
miss
kingsley
absence
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
in
the
museum
likely
to
excite
the
cupidity
of
even
an
amateur
thief
the
specimens
though
interesting
to
the
school
were
of
no
monetary
value
lorraine
glance
went
slowly
round
the
room
and
took
in
the
desks
and
boxes
the
walls
on
which
she
had
pinned
natural
history
prints
and
finally
wandered
up
to
the
ceiling
ah
here
was
a
clue
at
last
the
in
the
corner
had
certainly
been
moved
it
did
not
now
quite
fit
down
there
was
about
an
inch
of
light
to
be
seen
round
its
edge
a
horrible
idea
suggested
itself
to
the
girls
somebody
was
in
hiding
up
there
the
bare
notion
blanched
their
cheeks
with
one
accord
they
fled
from
the
room
locked
the
door
on
the
outside
and
scurried
down
the
steps
in
the
yard
they
paused
what
was
to
be
done
next
they
did
not
feel
capable
of
tackling
a
possible
burglar
unaided
yet
it
seemed
rather
weak
to
run
away
let
fetch
morland
said
claudia
the
suggestion
seemed
a
good
one
lorraine
was
only
too
content
to
throw
herself
upon
masculine
aid
they
walked
at
double
speed
to
windy
howe
and
hauled
morland
from
the
piano
he
stopped
in
the
middle
of
a
brahms
sonata
and
offered
at
once
to
go
back
with
them
to
the
school
you
see
miss
kingsley
and
everybody
away
and
there
only
the
charwoman
about
explained
lorraine
i
know
she
be
worse
scared
than
ourselves
if
we
told
her
i
go
and
investigate
agreed
morland
rather
pleased
to
show
his
courage
before
the
girls
so
they
all
three
went
back
to
the
museum
and
here
morland
placed
desks
and
boxes
together
and
mounted
on
them
so
as
to
reach
the
through
which
he
wriggled
the
girls
held
the
pile
steady
and
watched
his
long
legs
disappear
through
the
opening
it
leads
on
to
the
roof
he
shouted
i
climb
up
and
explore
in
a
sort
of
garret
with
a
ladder
in
the
corner
to
the
waiting
girls
it
seemed
a
very
long
time
before
morland
returned
at
last
however
they
heard
his
footsteps
overhead
and
he
called
to
them
to
hold
the
erection
while
he
came
down
it
was
with
a
sense
of
relief
that
they
saw
his
boots
issue
through
the
they
had
had
an
idea
that
he
might
have
disappeared
for
ever
well
did
you
see
anybody
morland
shook
his
head
he
was
dusting
his
sleeves
and
trying
to
rub
the
dirt
off
his
hands
i
did
catch
a
burglar
but
i
made
a
discovery
he
said
slowly
what
the
girls
were
i
been
on
the
roof
did
you
know
the
telephone
wires
run
over
the
school
i
never
noticed
well
they
do
and
what
more
they
been
cut
great
scott
whoever
did
it
has
been
very
clever
it
was
a
unique
spot
to
get
at
them
and
impossible
to
be
seen
from
the
road
i
must
tell
uncle
barton
gasped
lorraine
breathlessly
it
exactly
what
he
was
wanting
to
find
out
we
better
ask
jones
if
anybody
has
been
hanging
about
the
place
suggested
claudia
the
charwoman
on
being
interviewed
assured
them
that
nobody
had
been
to
the
school
there
was
only
one
key
to
the
museum
so
it
could
not
have
been
entered
in
their
absence
did
you
leave
the
window
open
asked
morland
of
lorraine
i
believe
i
did
just
a
little
at
the
top
well
do
you
notice
that
the
leads
below
the
window
communicate
with
one
of
the
bedroom
windows
of
the
school
any
one
inside
the
gables
could
step
out
and
get
into
the
museum
that
way
but
jones
says
nobody
has
been
in
the
school
did
you
mrs
jones
yes
miss
no
one
but
myself
except
yes
i
do
remember
one
of
the
teachers
came
and
asked
if
she
might
fetch
a
book
she
forgotten
and
i
let
her
go
in
which
teacher
was
it
that
foreign
lady
madame
bertier
i
do
know
her
name
she
was
there
more
than
a
few
minutes
oh
said
lorraine
thoughtfully
thank
you
mrs
jones
uncle
barton
also
looked
thoughtful
when
lorraine
described
to
him
the
whole
occurrence
he
wrote
a
note
at
once
to
the
chief
constable
to
tell
him
where
the
telephone
wires
were
cut
and
sent
the
office
boy
to
deliver
it
then
he
asked
for
any
details
his
niece
could
supply
you
a
little
brick
he
commented
there
treachery
at
work
somewhere
undoubtedly
but
the
question
is
how
to
lay
our
hands
on
it
can
i
trust
you
and
the
castletons
just
to
keep
this
dark
for
the
present
i
rather
it
was
noised
all
about
the
place
i
my
own
ideas
and
i
want
to
work
them
out
in
my
own
way
shall
i
say
anything
about
it
to
madame
bertier
asked
lorraine
most
decidedly
not
please
do
mention
the
matter
to
anybody
you
can
give
the
key
of
the
museum
till
miss
kingsley
returns
you
need
to
go
there
again
at
present
i
be
scared
to
death
confessed
lorraine
in
spite
of
uncle
barton
forrester
injunctions
the
episode
of
the
cut
telephone
wires
became
known
the
castletons
on
their
return
home
had
found
madame
bertier
in
their
father
studio
sitting
for
her
portrait
and
being
full
of
the
exciting
subject
had
poured
out
their
story
the
pretty
russian
was
aghast
it
is
too
horrible
she
exclaimed
to
have
happened
while
miss
kingsley
is
away
some
burglar
would
be
bad
but
it
is
perhaps
a
spy
i
was
at
the
gables
yesterday
just
for
a
moment
to
fetch
a
book
i
saw
nothing
had
i
met
anyone
i
should
indeed
have
been
very
alarmed
the
police
will
no
doubt
keep
the
house
under
observation
now
the
question
is
how
anybody
got
into
the
room
when
it
was
locked
said
claudia
perhaps
they
brought
a
ladder
you
say
the
window
was
left
open
yes
but
it
shut
and
fastened
now
whoever
came
would
be
able
to
get
in
so
easily
again
the
easter
holidays
were
nearly
over
and
in
a
few
days
the
miss
kingsleys
would
be
back
to
look
after
their
own
property
and
take
what
precautions
they
thought
fit
against
burglars
or
spies
at
the
near
prospect
of
term
time
claudia
whose
spirits
had
effervesced
lately
suddenly
waxed
serious
lorraine
could
not
make
out
what
was
the
matter
with
her
you
look
about
as
cheerful
as
an
undertaker
old
sport
she
remonstrated
something
got
on
your
nerves
i
in
a
beastly
hole
admitted
claudia
with
a
gusty
sigh
i
know
i
a
slacker
what
have
you
been
doing
something
awful
go
ahead
and
confess
then
they
were
sitting
in
the
garden
at
windy
howe
resting
after
planting
some
rows
of
peas
and
sheltering
under
a
tree
from
the
heavy
drops
of
a
sudden
april
shower
claudia
pulled
off
her
gardening
gloves
and
rested
a
chin
upon
a
hand
there
was
desperate
trouble
in
her
blue
eyes
i
scared
to
go
back
to
school
and
that
the
fact
i
done
an
awful
thing
the
day
we
broke
up
miss
janet
gave
me
some
papers
to
be
signed
and
sent
in
to
the
kindergarten
college
she
said
they
must
be
posted
before
the
i
put
them
in
my
coat
pocket
well
i
only
just
remembered
them
lorraine
was
aghast
claudia
your
application
for
the
exam
how
you
forget
i
do
know
but
i
did
groaned
the
sinner
when
did
you
remember
only
this
morning
i
had
worn
my
coat
during
the
holidays
it
was
too
hot
i
put
it
on
this
morning
to
run
to
the
town
to
shop
for
violet
and
stuck
my
hand
in
my
pocket
and
found
that
wretched
envelope
but
did
you
never
think
of
it
once
during
the
holidays
i
should
have
thought
studying
would
bring
it
to
your
mind
i
have
done
any
studying
i
was
so
dead
sick
of
lessons
confessed
claudia
i
just
been
playing
about
with
the
children
all
the
time
oh
lorraine
tone
was
eloquent
what
miss
janet
say
speculated
claudia
gloomily
what
indeed
lorraine
did
not
dare
to
anticipate
what
would
happen
at
the
gables
on
the
receipt
of
such
news
only
a
member
of
the
haphazard
castleton
family
would
have
been
capable
of
such
a
shiftless
act
it
was
exactly
what
morland
would
have
done
but
lorraine
had
expected
better
things
from
claudia
illustration
claudia
how
you
forget
ca
you
get
it
signed
now
and
send
it
off
she
suggested
father
away
but
i
ask
him
to
sign
it
when
he
comes
back
and
post
it
at
once
i
do
suppose
it
much
use
though
oh
claudia
i
so
sorry
well
it
ca
be
helped
now
said
her
friend
rather
impatiently
the
rain
stopped
and
i
going
to
plant
another
row
of
peas
lorraine
could
not
quite
understand
claudia
attitude
of
mind
which
seemed
to
hold
more
dread
of
miss
janet
anger
than
concern
for
missing
the
application
for
the
scholarship
there
was
a
curious
shade
of
relief
mingled
with
her
contrition
she
began
to
sing
quite
cheerfully
as
she
planted
the
peas
and
when
constable
came
running
past
she
picked
him
up
and
kissed
him
violet
would
miss
me
dreadfully
if
i
went
away
we
been
friends
the
last
few
days
she
remarked
later
on
i
helped
to
make
baby
a
new
frock
and
he
looks
so
sweet
in
it
he
a
darling
there
was
trouble
at
the
gables
when
the
misses
kingsley
returned
and
learnt
the
bad
news
they
wrote
off
at
once
to
miss
halden
explaining
the
circumstances
but
the
answer
came
back
that
certain
rules
of
the
college
were
very
strict
and
the
governors
could
not
consider
any
application
submitted
later
than
the
also
wrote
the
principal
i
feel
that
a
girl
who
could
forget
such
an
immensely
important
step
in
her
own
career
would
be
of
no
use
to
us
and
i
could
not
feel
justified
in
awarding
her
a
scholarship
i
am
exceedingly
sorry
but
fear
this
decision
must
be
final
so
there
as
far
as
the
college
was
concerned
the
matter
ended
at
school
however
claudia
with
an
obstinate
look
on
her
face
weathered
the
storm
of
miss
janet
contempt
after
all
the
trouble
i
took
in
coaching
you
it
really
too
bad
you
ruined
your
own
career
and
no
one
but
yourself
to
thank
for
it
why
the
scholarship
was
as
good
as
gained
you
so
easily
have
passed
the
exam
it
was
all
arranged
with
miss
halden
and
you
spoilt
the
whole
thing
with
your
carelessness
you
might
at
least
have
the
grace
to
say
that
you
sorry
i
very
sorry
miss
janet
said
claudia
in
an
apathetic
voice
the
mistress
glanced
at
her
keenly
i
doubt
if
you
really
are
i
ca
make
you
out
i
disgusted
with
the
whole
affair
one
gets
very
little
thanks
for
trying
to
help
people
claudia
in
terrible
disgrace
retired
sobbing
later
on
however
she
poured
confidences
into
lorraine
ear
i
sorry
of
course
to
disappoint
miss
janet
but
i
ca
tell
you
how
relieved
i
am
really
i
never
wanted
to
go
and
that
the
fact
have
to
be
a
kindergarten
teacher
i
rather
go
on
the
land
if
i
leave
home
at
all
but
but
claudia
began
lorraine
with
sudden
enlightenment
were
you
going
to
be
i
suppose
so
i
fond
of
the
children
you
know
though
i
get
fed
up
with
them
sometimes
it
would
take
a
very
strong
magnet
to
draw
me
away
perhaps
if
something
really
offered
i
want
to
go
but
not
for
kindergarten
no
thanks
some
other
girl
may
get
the
scholarship
instead
of
me
and
she
welcome
to
it
after
all
home
is
a
very
nice
place
it
certainly
is
i
do
want
to
leave
mine
just
at
present
agreed
lorraine
reflectively
chapter
xv
an
academy
picture
with
the
beginning
of
a
new
term
two
very
important
events
happened
in
lorraine
little
world
mervyn
was
sent
to
redfern
college
and
morland
went
into
training
mervyn
exodus
was
really
somewhat
of
a
relief
for
he
had
been
getting
rather
out
of
hand
lately
and
had
waxed
so
obstreperous
on
occasion
that
his
father
had
decided
to
pack
him
off
at
once
for
a
taste
of
the
discipline
of
a
public
school
morland
who
was
now
eighteen
went
away
in
high
spirits
on
the
whole
he
was
tired
of
lounging
about
at
home
he
had
reached
the
age
when
the
boy
is
passing
into
manhood
and
begins
to
think
of
making
his
own
way
in
the
world
all
kinds
of
shadowy
pictures
of
the
future
were
floating
in
his
mental
vision
day
dreams
of
brave
deeds
and
great
achievements
and
laurel
wreaths
to
be
won
by
hands
that
had
the
luck
to
pluck
them
his
eyes
were
shining
as
he
bade
lorraine
you
must
have
thought
me
rather
a
slacker
sometimes
he
said
but
really
there
was
anything
to
urge
a
fellow
on
at
home
perhaps
tumble
into
my
own
niche
some
day
who
knows
would
you
be
glad
lorraine
if
you
saw
me
doing
decently
glad
of
course
i
should
i
did
know
whether
you
worry
your
head
one
way
or
another
about
it
or
care
twopence
whether
i
went
to
the
dogs
or
not
do
be
silly
you
not
going
to
the
dogs
i
might
if
nobody
was
sufficiently
interested
in
me
to
mind
heaps
of
people
are
interested
one
does
want
people
in
heaps
i
prefer
interest
singly
by
the
by
if
you
any
time
to
spare
you
might
write
to
a
fellow
now
and
again
i
want
letters
in
camp
all
serene
i
send
you
one
sometimes
just
to
remind
me
of
home
morland
i
believe
you
got
as
badly
as
claudia
be
back
at
porthkeverne
before
long
unless
i
greatly
mistaken
with
my
first
leave
certainly
twinkled
morland
as
the
weeks
passed
by
in
april
the
artistic
world
of
porthkeverne
reached
a
high
pitch
of
anticipation
and
excitement
practically
every
painter
there
had
submitted
something
to
the
academy
and
the
burning
question
was
which
among
them
would
be
lucky
enough
to
have
their
work
accepted
they
looked
out
eagerly
for
the
post
awaiting
either
a
welcome
varnishing
ticket
or
a
printed
notice
regretting
that
for
lack
of
space
their
contributions
could
not
be
included
in
the
exhibition
and
requesting
them
to
remove
their
pictures
as
speedily
as
possible
in
the
studio
down
by
the
harbour
expectation
ran
rife
margaret
lindsay
had
finished
her
painting
of
kilmeny
if
not
altogether
to
her
own
satisfaction
at
any
rate
to
that
of
most
of
her
friends
and
had
dispatched
it
to
the
academy
i
do
believe
for
a
moment
that
it
will
get
in
she
assured
lorraine
i
never
seem
to
have
any
luck
somehow
i
not
a
lucky
person
perhaps
you
will
have
this
time
said
lorraine
who
was
washing
out
oil
paint
brushes
for
her
friend
a
messy
task
which
she
sometimes
undertook
let
that
you
shall
be
accepted
you
be
all
the
in
the
world
wo
do
the
deed
if
the
judges
the
other
way
and
their
will
tugs
harder
than
ours
laughed
margaret
it
depends
so
much
on
the
taste
of
the
judges
there
a
fashion
in
pictures
as
in
other
things
and
it
constantly
changing
is
there
why
that
i
ca
tell
you
except
that
people
tire
of
one
style
and
like
another
first
the
classical
school
was
the
favourite
then
had
its
innings
then
impressionism
came
up
each
period
in
painting
is
generally
boomed
by
some
celebrated
art
critic
who
deprecates
the
methods
and
cracks
up
the
new
the
public
are
rather
like
sheep
they
buy
what
the
critics
tell
them
to
admire
had
a
delightful
skit
on
that
once
ruskin
had
been
pitching
into
the
commonplace
artist
style
of
picture
rather
freely
so
evolved
a
dejected
brother
of
the
brush
giving
vent
to
this
despairing
wail
takes
and
paints
hears
no
complaints
and
sells
before
i
dry
then
savage
ruskin
he
sticks
his
tusk
in
and
nobody
will
buy
i
love
cackled
lorraine
drying
the
brushes
on
a
clean
tell
me
some
more
artistic
titbits
do
you
know
the
one
about
the
old
lady
in
the
train
who
overheard
the
two
artists
talking
one
said
to
the
other
doing
in
children
nowadays
and
his
friend
answered
feller
i
know
knocked
off
seven
little
girls
heads
nasty
raw
things
they
were
too
and
a
chap
came
in
and
carried
them
off
just
as
they
were
wet
on
the
stretcher
and
said
he
could
do
with
a
few
more
the
poor
old
lady
who
knew
nothing
of
artists
lingo
imagined
that
she
had
surprised
details
of
a
ghastly
murder
instead
of
a
satisfactory
sale
to
an
enterprising
dealer
but
to
come
back
to
the
academy
lorraine
i
know
i
sha
get
in
i
sent
five
times
before
and
always
had
the
same
disappointment
if
you
can
call
it
a
disappointment
when
you
do
expect
anything
the
last
time
it
happened
i
was
in
town
and
i
went
to
the
academy
myself
to
fetch
away
my
pictures
as
i
walked
down
the
and
out
into
piccadilly
with
my
parcel
under
my
arm
i
felt
pretty
blue
and
i
suppose
i
looked
it
for
a
wretched
little
street
arab
stared
at
me
with
mock
sympathy
and
piped
out
they
rejected
you
too
poor
darling
he
said
it
so
funnily
that
i
help
laughing
in
spite
of
my
blues
when
are
you
likely
to
hear
your
luck
asked
lorraine
any
day
now
but
it
will
be
bad
luck
then
i
shall
call
every
day
on
my
way
home
from
school
to
see
if
had
a
letter
lorraine
kept
her
word
and
each
afternoon
took
the
path
by
the
harbour
instead
of
the
direct
road
up
the
hill
day
after
day
passed
and
the
had
not
yet
delivered
the
official
communication
no
news
is
good
news
cheered
lorraine
saunders
had
his
rejection
last
week
so
claudia
told
me
castleton
only
heard
this
morning
how
many
has
he
in
three
the
view
of
tangy
point
from
the
beach
madox
wheeling
perugia
in
the
barrow
and
the
portrait
of
madame
bertier
claudia
says
immensely
relieved
because
even
gilbertson
is
this
year
here
comes
the
second
post
is
there
anything
for
you
i
going
to
see
lorraine
in
her
impatience
tore
down
the
wooden
steps
of
the
studio
and
waylaid
the
she
came
back
like
a
triumphant
whirlwind
waving
a
letter
i
believe
this
is
oh
do
open
it
quick
i
ca
wait
i
never
felt
so
excited
to
know
anything
in
all
my
life
i
could
scream
margaret
equally
agitated
nevertheless
kept
her
feelings
under
control
and
opened
the
envelope
with
outward
calm
though
her
fingers
trembled
noticeably
she
looked
at
the
enclosure
flushed
crimson
and
turning
to
lorraine
dropped
a
mock
curtsy
madam
kilmeny
she
announced
i
happy
to
be
able
to
inform
you
that
your
portrait
is
to
appear
upon
the
walls
of
the
royal
academy
oh
hurrah
jodelled
lorraine
careering
round
the
studio
in
an
ecstatic
dance
somewhat
to
the
peril
of
various
studies
on
easels
i
it
would
get
in
carina
i
had
a
kind
of
premonition
that
it
would
and
i
had
a
premonition
the
other
way
entirely
i
never
was
so
surprised
in
my
life
you
been
my
little
mascot
and
brought
me
the
luck
no
indeed
it
your
own
cleverness
it
a
beautiful
painting
claudia
says
even
her
father
admired
it
and
he
scarcely
ever
allows
anybody
work
is
decent
except
his
own
i
certainly
take
praise
from
castleton
as
a
compliment
admitted
margaret
i
glad
to
hear
that
he
liked
it
well
this
is
actually
my
first
real
artistic
success
i
do
know
myself
this
afternoon
i
feel
an
inch
taller
than
usual
and
so
do
i
to
think
i
going
to
be
hung
in
the
academy
of
course
i
know
you
idealized
me
out
of
all
recognition
but
there
a
foundation
of
in
the
picture
enough
to
about
the
castletons
have
been
painted
so
often
they
do
care
but
it
a
unique
experience
for
me
it
makes
me
feel
somehow
as
if
were
kilmeny
and
had
spent
those
seven
long
years
among
the
fairies
i
felt
it
all
the
time
i
was
standing
for
you
carina
that
where
you
made
such
a
perfect
model
i
could
see
the
glamour
of
the
fairies
in
your
face
and
tried
to
catch
it
in
my
painting
i
always
contend
that
one
of
the
chief
elements
in
a
good
sitter
is
imagination
so
as
to
maintain
the
right
expression
one
sees
many
apathetic
portraits
and
knows
that
the
originals
must
have
been
feeling
bored
to
tears
you
never
looked
bored
no
the
fairies
were
dancing
round
me
all
the
time
you
conjured
them
up
do
you
know
carina
i
think
fairies
are
your
forte
i
like
those
small
paintings
of
them
better
than
anything
else
you
do
those
coloured
frontispieces
for
children
magazines
certainly
the
only
things
in
which
i
ever
succeeded
it
well
to
realize
one
limitations
i
been
so
ambitious
in
my
time
and
wanted
to
paint
historic
scenes
and
and
other
things
quite
beyond
my
powers
it
strange
if
the
line
we
rather
despise
turns
out
to
be
our
best
bit
of
work
look
at
edward
lear
he
was
a
rather
classically
inclined
artist
whose
serious
work
seems
to
have
vanished
yet
he
is
known
and
appreciated
all
over
the
world
by
the
delightful
and
inimitable
of
that
he
knocked
off
in
a
few
leisure
hours
to
amuse
the
children
of
a
noble
family
whose
portraits
he
was
painting
hans
andersen
too
is
another
instance
no
one
ever
now
reads
his
numerous
novels
and
solid
books
but
his
have
been
translated
into
almost
every
language
nothing
so
charming
and
poetical
has
ever
been
written
his
is
a
magic
flute
that
draws
children
of
every
clime
and
age
to
listen
to
him
not
that
i
for
a
moment
comparing
myself
to
edward
lear
or
hans
andersen
all
the
same
i
think
i
shall
take
a
hammer
and
smash
up
those
statues
i
was
trying
my
hand
at
and
stick
to
fairies
for
the
future
i
hope
they
hang
on
the
line
so
do
i
but
i
do
expect
it
it
will
be
most
exciting
to
go
up
to
town
and
see
it
i
wonder
you
wonder
what
asked
lorraine
for
margaret
had
suddenly
stopped
short
never
mind
it
was
an
idea
that
came
into
my
head
perhaps
i
tell
you
some
other
time
oh
do
tell
me
now
certainly
not
you
must
wait
no
it
no
use
your
guessing
for
i
sha
say
whether
you
right
or
wrong
lorraine
guesses
which
were
of
rather
a
wild
description
did
not
come
anywhere
near
the
real
truth
which
was
sprung
upon
her
a
few
days
later
by
her
enterprising
friend
it
was
nothing
more
or
less
than
an
invitation
to
go
up
to
london
with
miss
lindsay
and
see
kilmeny
for
herself
on
the
wall
of
burlington
house
i
dare
tell
you
beforehand
in
case
it
should
be
an
impossible
scheme
said
margaret
but
your
mother
gives
permission
and
i
saw
miss
kingsley
myself
and
she
promised
you
a
few
days
holiday
i
told
her
it
was
part
of
your
education
to
see
the
academy
and
she
quite
agrees
with
me
so
you
to
go
this
was
news
indeed
lorraine
was
half
crazy
with
joy
though
she
had
turned
seventeen
she
had
never
yet
been
to
london
porthkeverne
was
a
long
journey
from
town
and
any
holidays
which
she
had
taken
had
been
to
visit
relations
in
other
parts
of
the
country
she
had
envied
rosemary
when
the
latter
started
for
the
college
of
music
now
she
was
actually
to
see
the
great
city
for
herself
and
in
company
with
carina
of
all
delightful
people
in
the
world
they
were
to
go
up
for
a
whole
precious
week
and
to
stay
in
a
hotel
lorraine
had
never
yet
stayed
in
a
hotel
and
they
were
to
do
theatres
and
as
many
of
the
sights
as
could
possibly
be
crammed
into
the
short
space
of
time
the
prospect
was
dazzling
monica
catching
in
her
breath
sharply
decreed
you
the
biggest
lucker
i
ever
met
lorraine
clothes
of
course
were
a
paramount
topic
i
ca
let
miss
lindsay
take
a
cinderella
with
her
to
london
said
mother
looking
over
the
fashionable
advertisements
in
the
papers
and
trying
to
decide
what
was
the
most
suitable
costume
for
a
girl
of
seventeen
you
want
something
to
look
smart
in
at
the
academy
and
yet
that
wo
get
soiled
directly
with
going
about
in
motor
omnibuses
now
this
is
a
sweet
dress
i
like
you
in
this
but
it
would
be
ruined
in
five
minutes
if
you
were
caught
in
a
shower
and
how
can
we
guarantee
fine
weather
does
your
umbrella
want
if
there
is
time
to
have
it
done
rosemary
must
lend
you
her
new
one
by
dint
of
much
eager
cogitation
on
the
part
of
the
whole
family
lorraine
wardrobe
was
at
last
satisfactorily
arranged
and
packed
in
a
suit
case
she
herself
in
a
new
grey
coat
and
skirt
and
a
grey
travelling
hat
trimmed
with
pink
joined
margaret
lindsay
at
the
railway
station
they
were
to
catch
the
early
express
and
mother
rosemary
and
monica
came
to
see
them
off
it
felt
so
grand
to
be
going
away
without
the
rest
of
the
family
and
to
hang
out
of
the
carriage
window
shouting
while
they
frantically
waved
handkerchiefs
upon
the
platform
lorraine
still
clutching
in
her
new
gloves
the
sticky
packet
of
sweets
that
monica
had
pressed
as
a
last
offering
into
her
hand
went
on
signalling
until
margaret
pulled
her
forcibly
back
on
to
her
seat
we
do
want
your
head
whisked
off
first
thing
please
and
coming
to
the
bridge
i
would
sit
on
the
if
i
were
you
let
me
put
it
up
on
the
rack
i
excited
sighed
lorraine
i
glad
we
got
the
carriage
to
ourselves
carina
because
we
can
talk
is
it
sport
we
sha
keep
it
long
it
will
probably
fill
up
at
cyr
so
work
off
your
spirits
now
if
you
want
to
but
my
advice
is
to
take
things
calmly
or
you
be
tired
out
before
we
get
to
town
the
long
railway
journey
first
along
the
coast
and
then
inland
through
scenery
which
was
very
different
from
porthkeverne
was
deeply
interesting
to
lorraine
and
if
she
grew
tired
and
closed
her
eyes
for
part
of
the
route
her
enthusiasm
woke
again
when
they
reached
london
the
great
station
with
its
crowds
of
people
the
rows
of
cabs
and
taxis
the
streets
with
their
endless
traffic
all
seemed
a
new
world
to
the
little
country
mouse
who
was
making
her
first
acquaintance
with
the
metropolis
it
busier
than
i
expected
and
ever
so
much
dirtier
she
commented
yes
it
a
different
world
from
porthkeverne
no
arum
lilies
and
yuccas
and
aloes
only
and
in
the
squares
here
we
are
at
our
hotel
it
will
be
nice
to
wash
and
rest
lorraine
with
a
beaming
face
sat
next
morning
at
the
little
table
laid
for
two
and
discussed
plans
over
the
breakfast
bacon
she
had
drawn
up
a
programme
of
things
she
wanted
to
see
in
town
of
so
lengthy
a
description
that
margaret
lindsay
declared
it
would
take
at
least
a
month
instead
of
a
week
to
work
through
it
adequately
some
of
the
shows
are
shut
up
because
of
the
war
she
said
going
through
the
list
and
putting
ticks
against
the
most
suitable
places
we
can
see
the
zoo
and
madame
tussaud
and
kew
gardens
and
i
enquire
whether
the
tower
and
the
houses
of
parliament
are
open
to
visitors
at
present
westminster
abbey
will
of
course
be
on
view
but
i
expect
we
shall
find
the
monuments
banked
up
with
sandbags
for
fear
of
raids
never
mind
we
do
poets
corner
at
any
rate
what
would
you
like
to
start
with
this
morning
may
i
choose
then
i
plump
for
the
academy
so
to
the
academy
they
went
and
it
was
a
very
gay
version
of
lorraine
who
walked
up
the
flight
of
stairs
at
burlington
house
and
through
the
turnstile
into
the
entrance
hall
where
the
palms
are
she
had
seen
small
exhibitions
at
the
arts
club
in
porthkeverne
but
never
a
series
of
great
rooms
hung
with
large
pictures
margaret
was
turning
over
the
pages
of
the
catalogue
oh
do
find
out
where
is
and
let
us
go
and
see
her
first
begged
lorraine
she
in
room
vii
no
it
was
difficult
to
tear
margaret
away
from
the
nearest
pictures
but
lorraine
impatience
dragged
her
along
to
room
vii
kilmeny
was
really
in
a
very
good
position
if
not
exactly
on
the
line
only
just
above
it
and
fortunately
the
pictures
on
either
side
were
in
low
tone
and
did
not
spoil
the
effect
of
colour
a
field
of
poppies
or
a
venetian
carnival
next
door
would
have
utterly
killed
my
sunset
and
thistledown
rejoiced
margaret
i
ought
to
be
very
grateful
to
the
hanging
committee
it
does
look
so
bad
as
i
expected
bad
it
the
most
beautiful
picture
in
the
whole
room
we
must
hunt
up
our
other
friends
said
margaret
turning
over
the
pages
of
the
catalogue
where
are
castleton
i
wonder
oh
there
one
in
the
next
room
no
let
go
and
look
at
it
the
picture
in
question
was
the
portrait
of
madame
bertier
a
clever
study
in
an
impressionist
style
showing
the
bright
eyes
and
eager
features
of
that
volatile
lady
under
cover
of
a
large
black
hat
and
veil
it
was
perhaps
one
of
the
best
pictures
that
castleton
had
ever
painted
and
it
was
attracting
quite
a
small
crowd
margaret
and
lorraine
came
up
and
joined
the
outer
circle
of
admirers
in
front
of
them
stood
two
gentlemen
and
a
lady
foreigners
they
spoke
softly
and
rapidly
together
in
french
lorraine
whose
knowledge
of
that
language
was
not
far
beyond
the
ordinary
schoolgirl
standard
could
not
understand
all
they
were
saying
but
she
caught
a
word
here
and
there
the
lady
was
admiring
the
skill
of
the
painting
and
voting
it
worthy
of
the
salon
in
paris
one
of
the
gentlemen
admired
the
beauty
of
the
model
the
other
with
a
pleased
smile
explained
that
it
was
his
wife
and
that
though
a
charming
portrait
it
scarcely
did
justice
to
the
original
mais
à
merveille
he
said
with
a
quick
gesticulation
as
he
moved
on
to
allow
other
people
access
to
the
picture
lorraine
nudged
margaret
and
drew
her
aside
did
you
hear
that
she
whispered
that
man
in
the
light
suit
declared
that
madame
bertier
was
his
wife
impossible
her
husband
is
interned
in
germany
well
that
was
what
he
said
at
any
rate
perhaps
he
was
making
up
just
for
effect
some
people
like
to
tell
these
wonderful
fibs
in
public
just
to
impress
the
outside
world
then
why
did
he
speak
english
if
he
wanted
to
impress
people
which
man
was
it
that
one
next
to
the
lady
in
blue
why
why
if
i
not
utterly
mistaken
i
verily
believe
it
the
man
we
looked
at
through
the
glasses
from
tangy
point
he
met
madame
bertier
on
the
shore
and
i
could
remember
where
i
seen
him
before
oh
carina
follow
them
and
i
look
at
him
again
but
the
crowd
in
the
academy
was
rapidly
increasing
and
the
three
foreigners
were
lost
behind
a
row
of
ladies
in
fashionable
spring
hats
they
must
have
made
an
unexpected
exit
for
though
lorraine
kept
her
eyes
open
for
them
the
whole
of
the
morning
she
did
not
chance
to
see
them
again
it
rather
mysterious
is
it
she
said
to
margaret
afterwards
it
is
if
he
was
telling
the
truth
some
of
these
foreigners
are
queer
people
never
mind
madame
bertier
now
let
us
enjoy
ourselves
shall
we
get
tickets
for
a
or
leave
theatres
for
the
evenings
remember
we
want
plenty
of
time
for
kew
chapter
xvi
an
opportunity
lorraine
after
a
delirious
round
of
pleasure
in
town
returned
to
porthkeverne
quite
tired
out
with
festivities
but
declaring
that
she
had
had
the
time
of
her
life
it
will
be
your
turn
next
she
said
to
monica
who
sat
on
the
floor
while
she
unpacked
and
demanded
a
circumstantial
account
of
every
hour
of
the
gay
visit
we
shall
certainly
have
you
jaunting
off
to
london
some
day
not
till
i
seventeen
perhaps
the
voice
was
doleful
and
just
ages
to
wait
daisy
phillips
has
been
to
london
three
times
and
she
only
ten
she
crows
over
me
dreadfully
poor
old
cuckoo
you
a
child
see
what
i
got
for
you
inside
this
parcel
a
japanese
the
very
thing
i
wanted
and
such
a
lovely
one
it
nicer
than
anybody
else
in
the
whole
form
then
you
score
over
daisy
for
once
rather
lorraine
you
a
trump
oh
and
the
ducky
little
blue
knife
inside
and
pink
pencils
i
know
everybody
want
to
borrow
them
at
once
but
i
sha
lend
them
to
a
single
soul
they
too
nice
even
to
use
myself
say
i
not
to
lend
them
and
then
the
girls
call
me
stingy
all
right
i
absolutely
forbid
them
to
be
lent
where
rosemary
a
parcel
here
that
may
interest
her
no
cuckoo
you
not
to
peep
inside
what
a
paul
pry
you
are
go
and
call
her
and
i
show
it
to
her
myself
somehow
lorraine
felt
as
if
the
little
visit
to
london
had
suddenly
added
years
to
her
age
it
had
enlarged
her
circle
of
experiences
so
greatly
that
she
had
begun
to
look
on
life
from
almost
a
standpoint
she
had
gone
away
older
certainly
than
monica
but
regarded
in
the
family
category
as
one
of
the
children
and
she
had
returned
to
take
her
place
on
a
level
with
richard
donald
rodney
and
rosemary
she
was
allowed
to
read
richard
letters
from
mesopotamia
instead
of
only
having
portions
retailed
to
her
and
she
was
not
sent
out
of
the
room
now
when
father
and
mother
discussed
rodney
future
for
those
halcyon
times
when
peace
should
be
declared
and
he
should
leave
the
air
force
she
began
in
some
measure
to
realize
her
mother
daily
hourly
anxiety
about
these
boys
at
the
front
and
to
understand
how
behind
all
the
happiness
of
her
daily
life
stood
a
nightmare
with
a
spectral
hand
raised
ever
ready
to
fall
on
those
three
best
beloved
trouble
which
mercifully
spared
their
own
family
struck
nevertheless
very
near
a
yellow
envelope
arrived
one
day
at
the
barton
house
and
aunt
carrie
opened
it
with
trembling
fingers
and
a
sinking
heart
there
no
answer
she
said
briefly
to
the
waiting
telegraph
girl
then
she
sat
down
and
tried
to
face
what
the
short
message
from
the
war
office
really
conveyed
only
twelve
words
but
it
meant
the
hope
of
a
family
trailed
in
the
dust
lindon
their
one
treasured
boy
had
gone
west
well
other
mothers
had
given
their
dearest
and
best
she
would
offer
him
gladly
joyfully
on
the
altar
of
britain
glory
but
her
face
seemed
to
grow
suddenly
shrunken
and
the
high
colour
faded
from
her
cheeks
leaving
a
network
of
little
red
veins
instead
if
only
she
would
try
to
be
so
brave
about
it
said
george
forrester
it
such
a
terrific
effort
for
her
to
keep
up
like
this
why
the
very
next
day
she
went
to
the
red
cross
hospital
just
as
usual
she
has
slacked
a
single
thing
the
strain
must
be
tremendous
she
absolutely
worshipped
that
poor
boy
the
girls
had
an
innings
in
comparison
with
him
i
admire
the
way
she
taking
it
but
i
afraid
some
day
it
will
be
more
than
she
can
stand
and
she
just
collapse
if
it
had
been
richard
i
could
have
borne
to
speak
of
him
to
anybody
just
at
first
yet
she
talks
quite
calmly
of
lindon
it
too
much
for
human
nature
uncle
barton
grown
suddenly
ten
years
older
went
about
looking
small
and
stooping
with
a
reef
of
wrinkles
about
his
kind
eyes
he
clung
to
betty
whose
manner
had
softened
under
the
blow
of
the
three
girls
she
understood
him
the
best
and
though
she
was
still
undemonstrative
her
silent
consideration
comforted
him
lorraine
in
the
sanctuary
of
the
studio
by
the
harbour
railed
at
providence
why
should
lindon
be
taken
she
asked
bitterly
lindon
the
nicest
of
all
our
cousins
oh
carina
why
should
a
splendid
hopeful
young
life
like
this
be
sacrificed
and
poor
landry
be
left
behind
i
understand
it
seems
so
futile
such
a
waste
margaret
stroked
her
hand
for
a
moment
before
she
answered
it
may
seem
so
on
the
face
of
it
but
then
we
do
see
the
whole
only
one
side
of
it
perhaps
the
splendid
useful
life
is
wanted
for
work
and
greater
development
in
the
next
world
where
it
can
spread
its
spiritual
wings
unhampered
by
physical
disabilities
and
poor
landry
may
be
needed
here
as
a
discipline
to
purge
somebody
soul
or
to
bring
kindness
to
a
heart
that
might
otherwise
have
gone
unenlarged
this
world
is
a
school
to
train
character
and
if
some
of
us
are
sent
on
quickly
into
a
higher
form
it
is
because
there
are
other
lessons
to
learn
there
for
a
moment
call
lindon
sacrifice
have
you
ever
read
these
lines
picket
frozen
on
duty
a
mother
starved
for
her
brood
socrates
drinking
the
hemlock
and
jesus
on
the
rood
the
million
who
humble
and
nameless
the
straight
hard
pathway
trod
some
call
it
consecration
and
others
call
it
god
there
was
one
person
who
lorraine
suspected
was
grieving
for
lindon
more
than
she
would
allow
anybody
to
imagine
rosemary
had
always
been
fond
of
this
particular
cousin
and
between
the
of
dukes
and
generals
who
were
to
sue
for
her
sister
hand
it
had
sometimes
occurred
to
lorraine
that
a
far
more
ordinary
and
commonplace
romance
might
be
enacted
under
her
eyes
near
at
home
lindon
had
been
wont
to
come
to
the
house
far
more
frequently
than
elsie
betty
or
vivien
he
had
always
enjoyed
rosemary
singing
and
had
given
her
his
photo
in
a
locket
before
he
went
away
he
had
written
to
her
often
from
the
front
and
though
there
had
been
no
hint
of
such
a
thing
as
an
engagement
it
had
been
apparent
to
anyone
not
absolutely
blind
that
they
were
interested
in
each
other
it
is
perhaps
much
harder
for
a
girl
in
such
circumstances
to
lose
her
lover
than
for
one
who
is
definitely
engaged
and
can
claim
open
sympathy
for
her
sorrow
rosemary
felt
that
she
could
not
talk
about
lindon
to
elsie
betty
and
vivien
they
had
always
been
rather
jealous
of
his
preference
for
her
and
had
resented
his
frequent
visits
to
pendlehurst
they
did
not
know
about
the
locket
or
the
letters
she
kissed
uncle
barton
however
with
extra
affection
and
he
responded
so
warmly
holding
her
arm
as
they
walked
down
the
garden
that
she
somehow
thought
he
understood
so
rosemary
gulped
back
this
trouble
as
she
had
borne
her
disappointment
about
the
college
of
music
and
flung
herself
into
that
universal
panacea
for
work
for
the
red
cross
she
slaved
at
three
mornings
a
week
at
the
hospital
and
put
in
alternate
afternoons
rolling
bandages
at
the
depot
she
would
have
given
up
her
whole
time
to
either
but
that
her
mother
would
not
allow
you
all
eyes
child
she
commented
you
must
get
out
into
the
fresh
air
this
lovely
weather
and
put
some
roses
into
your
cheeks
i
shall
give
you
a
tonic
you
look
like
a
canary
that
been
moulting
privately
rosemary
felt
as
if
her
heart
had
been
moulting
and
she
had
not
yet
had
time
to
grow
her
new
spiritual
feathers
the
fact
that
anybody
was
noticing
however
made
her
brace
up
she
had
no
wish
to
pose
as
a
sentimentalist
she
swallowed
the
tonic
dutifully
took
the
prescribed
daily
walk
and
even
with
a
great
effort
practised
the
piano
she
could
not
yet
bring
herself
to
touch
her
songs
the
remembrance
of
signor
arezzo
verdict
was
still
too
raw
illustration
claudia
flung
her
arms
round
rosemary
neck
and
hugged
her
one
glorious
beautiful
afternoon
saw
rosemary
wending
her
way
up
the
hill
to
the
castletons
lorraine
had
promised
to
send
a
paper
pattern
to
claudia
but
had
been
at
home
all
day
with
a
violent
headache
so
rosemary
had
volunteered
to
walk
to
windy
howe
after
tea
and
take
it
she
went
by
a
short
cut
through
the
fields
and
approached
the
house
by
way
of
the
orchard
the
were
in
full
blossom
the
lovely
pink
bloom
stood
out
against
the
blue
of
the
afternoon
sky
in
a
delicate
maze
of
colour
too
subtle
for
even
the
most
cunning
artist
hand
to
reproduce
castleton
sketch
left
on
its
easel
under
the
hedge
and
splotched
with
dabs
of
rose
madder
and
payne
grey
gave
only
the
faintest
impression
of
the
fairy
scene
clumps
of
primroses
bloomed
among
the
grass
and
a
thrush
on
the
of
a
hawthorn
bough
trilled
in
rivalry
with
the
blackbird
whose
nest
was
in
the
old
they
were
not
the
only
musicians
however
somebody
had
opened
the
gate
from
the
garden
and
was
walking
leisurely
down
the
orchard
somebody
in
a
light
cotton
dress
with
the
sunshine
gleaming
on
her
golden
hair
she
came
slowly
and
sang
as
she
walked
sang
like
the
blackbird
and
the
thrush
for
sheer
enjoyment
of
the
glory
of
the
spring
day
the
clear
high
notes
went
thrilling
through
the
air
with
all
the
freshness
and
sweetness
of
the
birds
tones
rosemary
unnoticed
stood
aside
to
watch
and
listen
as
claudia
still
warbling
on
high
a
stopped
under
an
to
feed
a
coopful
of
chickens
with
some
bread
she
had
brought
the
girl
beautiful
face
and
figure
against
the
background
and
the
blue
sky
made
a
picture
worthy
of
the
brush
of
an
academician
heavens
thought
rosemary
what
a
voice
if
signor
arezzo
could
hear
now
he
consider
it
worth
training
it
has
all
the
glorious
tone
and
volume
that
i
lack
and
so
pure
and
high
i
should
think
she
could
take
c
the
girl
looks
a
singer
with
that
magnificent
chest
and
throat
she
ought
to
be
able
to
bring
out
her
notes
she
has
such
a
splendid
physique
she
a
lovely
girl
too
what
a
sensation
she
make
on
a
concert
platform
aloud
however
rosemary
simply
said
good
afternoon
presented
the
paper
pattern
explained
that
lorraine
had
a
headache
and
asked
if
claudia
were
fond
of
singing
claudia
flushed
crimson
oh
i
ca
sing
she
stammered
not
really
only
just
to
myself
when
nobody
listening
i
did
know
you
were
there
you
ought
to
take
lessons
commented
rosemary
claudia
shook
her
head
she
was
pinning
back
a
yellow
curl
with
a
clasp
that
quite
impossible
so
it
not
an
atom
of
use
thinking
about
it
it
beata
turn
for
music
and
she
to
begin
the
violin
with
madame
bertier
next
term
do
look
distressed
i
just
squall
on
to
please
myself
nobody
else
cares
to
hear
me
i
sure
it
a
pity
to
waste
a
talent
said
rosemary
claudia
shrugged
her
shoulders
it
is
wasted
it
comes
in
handy
to
croon
the
babies
to
sleep
she
answered
humorously
and
as
i
going
to
stay
at
home
for
the
present
it
will
most
probably
be
wanted
rosemary
went
home
with
her
head
in
a
whirl
a
voice
like
that
to
be
devoted
to
crooning
children
to
sleep
it
seemed
wicked
her
experience
at
the
college
had
taught
her
enough
to
make
her
realize
how
much
might
be
made
of
claudia
voice
with
proper
training
oh
if
she
could
only
have
exchanged
places
with
claudia
for
a
moment
a
flood
of
wild
bitter
jealousy
swept
over
her
this
girl
had
all
the
qualifications
for
the
want
of
which
she
herself
had
failed
why
had
not
providence
who
gave
her
the
keen
enthusiasm
for
music
also
gifted
her
with
that
throat
and
voice
it
not
fair
raged
rosemary
wiping
away
very
salt
tears
some
people
have
all
the
luck
in
life
i
give
worlds
for
a
strong
voice
instead
of
my
wretched
little
twitter
from
her
sister
she
enquired
whether
claudia
could
dance
dance
echoed
lorraine
eloquently
you
should
just
see
her
i
wish
you
been
at
the
rhythmic
dancing
display
last
christmas
her
dance
was
simply
a
dream
everybody
said
they
never
saw
anything
quite
so
beautiful
miss
leighton
was
tremendously
proud
of
her
she
said
that
claudia
was
the
only
girl
in
the
whole
school
who
took
to
the
poses
absolutely
naturally
she
fell
into
them
as
easily
as
easily
while
all
the
rest
of
us
had
to
practise
no
end
she
a
very
graceful
girl
as
well
as
immensely
pretty
there
was
a
terrific
struggle
raging
in
rosemary
heart
she
knew
that
signor
arezzo
was
always
on
the
for
really
suitable
sopranos
to
train
for
opera
a
girl
who
fulfilled
his
critical
conditions
would
be
awarded
entirely
free
tuition
with
a
in
addition
at
the
college
of
music
if
claudia
could
be
coached
a
little
in
signor
arezzo
particular
method
of
voice
production
so
that
no
glaring
faults
should
offend
him
it
was
highly
probable
that
if
she
were
to
sing
before
him
he
would
decide
to
give
her
a
training
after
two
terms
with
him
i
know
what
he
wants
reflected
rosemary
i
could
teach
someone
else
though
i
could
not
do
it
myself
there
are
all
my
books
of
exercises
and
studies
packed
away
at
home
made
up
my
mind
never
to
look
at
them
again
oh
dear
it
will
be
like
opening
a
wound
to
get
them
out
shall
i
or
shall
i
not
the
girl
seems
contented
enough
as
she
is
it
takes
some
qualifications
for
sainthood
to
hold
open
for
another
the
door
of
a
paradise
you
may
not
enter
yourself
as
rosemary
mind
up
and
down
her
eyes
fell
on
a
quotation
printed
on
a
calendar
which
hung
in
her
room
four
things
come
not
back
to
man
or
woman
the
sped
arrow
the
spoken
word
the
past
life
and
the
neglected
opportunity
it
an
opportunity
she
mused
an
opportunity
of
helping
such
as
probably
i
shall
never
find
again
in
the
whole
of
my
life
rosemary
doris
forrester
you
got
to
buck
up
and
not
be
an
envious
beast
you
going
to
unpack
that
music
and
teach
that
girl
all
you
know
say
so
the
real
not
the
horrid
mean
jealous
selfish
contemptible
part
of
me
here
goes
i
write
and
propose
it
and
send
the
letter
up
at
once
by
lorraine
so
as
to
burn
my
boats
i
hope
to
goodness
claudia
will
have
the
sense
to
snatch
at
such
a
good
offer
i
sha
tell
anybody
a
word
about
it
beforehand
lorraine
who
always
went
willingly
on
any
errand
to
windy
howe
handed
over
her
sister
impulsive
letter
quite
unwitting
of
its
contents
claudia
read
it
flushed
and
caught
her
breath
with
a
sharp
little
cry
she
turned
to
her
friend
with
eyes
like
two
stars
do
you
know
what
rosemary
proposes
she
asked
no
why
she
actually
offers
to
teach
me
to
sing
and
oh
lorraine
she
hints
that
if
i
try
hard
she
would
write
to
signor
arezzo
and
ask
him
to
hear
me
and
perhaps
he
would
be
able
to
give
me
a
scholarship
for
the
college
and
i
could
go
and
study
it
was
lorraine
turn
to
assimilate
the
surprise
good
old
rosemary
she
a
trump
card
but
i
thought
you
did
care
about
winning
scholarships
claudia
i
believe
you
missed
sending
in
that
application
on
purpose
claudia
blushed
consciously
that
was
altogether
different
i
hated
the
idea
of
teaching
kindergarten
but
to
study
singing
i
it
you
know
how
fond
i
am
of
music
as
fond
as
morland
is
really
only
i
never
had
his
fingers
for
the
piano
i
should
be
much
of
a
player
i
know
but
to
sing
it
my
ideal
i
go
and
write
to
rosemary
now
and
say
i
ready
to
be
her
pupil
oh
it
good
of
her
so
the
exercises
and
studies
came
out
of
their
retirement
in
the
dark
cupboard
after
all
and
rosemary
grew
so
interested
in
putting
claudia
through
her
paces
as
she
described
it
that
her
own
bitter
disappointment
began
somehow
to
soften
and
tone
down
claudia
was
a
pattern
pupil
to
begin
with
her
voice
was
such
excellent
material
to
work
upon
then
she
had
a
very
world
of
young
enthusiasm
and
was
sufficiently
modest
to
accept
her
teacher
dicta
without
argument
she
practised
diligently
and
the
training
soon
began
to
tell
in
quite
a
short
time
there
was
marked
improvement
rosemary
listening
to
her
deliciously
pure
high
notes
felt
a
vicarious
satisfaction
they
were
so
exactly
what
she
had
always
longed
to
produce
herself
i
sha
write
to
signor
arezzo
till
we
through
book
ii
she
decreed
if
you
go
on
at
this
rate
i
think
he
be
satisfied
when
he
hears
you
if
he
accepts
you
i
be
proud
for
answer
claudia
flung
her
arms
round
rosemary
neck
and
hugged
her
you
the
sweetest
kindest
most
unselfish
darling
in
the
whole
of
the
wide
world
she
blurted
out
chapter
xvii
a
beano
though
lorraine
and
claudia
might
regard
madame
bertier
with
more
or
less
suspicion
she
was
an
immense
favourite
with
the
rest
of
the
school
the
misses
kingsley
found
the
vivacious
little
russian
lady
one
of
the
best
teachers
they
had
ever
had
and
treasured
her
accordingly
while
most
of
the
girls
still
revolved
round
her
orbit
she
was
undoubtedly
very
clever
and
fascinating
there
is
a
certain
type
of
pretty
woman
who
can
be
adorable
to
her
own
sex
madame
liked
admiration
if
it
were
only
that
of
a
schoolgirl
and
she
thought
the
flowers
and
little
notes
that
were
showered
upon
her
charming
tokens
of
her
popularity
they
practise
their
hearts
upon
me
these
poor
children
she
would
observe
sentimentally
the
little
love
letters
ah
they
are
à
fait
wait
a
few
years
they
will
be
writing
them
to
somebody
more
interesting
than
their
teacher
oh
yes
i
know
well
for
goodness
sake
do
put
such
ideas
into
their
heads
said
miss
janet
who
admired
the
type
of
girl
and
had
no
weakness
for
romance
i
wish
you
would
encourage
them
to
write
you
those
silly
notes
it
a
form
of
sentiment
i
no
patience
with
at
all
a
mere
waste
of
time
and
paper
madame
shrugged
her
shoulders
eloquently
what
will
you
we
all
have
our
own
methods
as
for
me
i
win
their
funny
little
hearts
then
they
will
work
at
their
lessons
for
love
yes
for
sheer
love
in
but
a
few
months
they
have
made
de
progrès
pas
ah
it
is
my
theory
that
we
must
love
first
if
we
will
learn
though
miss
janet
might
sniff
at
madame
sentimental
method
of
education
she
nevertheless
could
not
deny
its
admirable
results
in
french
and
music
the
school
had
lately
made
enormous
strides
the
elder
girls
had
begun
to
read
french
for
amusement
and
the
juniors
had
learnt
to
play
some
french
games
which
they
repeated
with
a
pretty
accent
both
violin
and
piano
students
played
with
a
fire
and
spirit
that
had
been
conspicuous
by
their
absence
a
year
ago
under
the
tame
instruction
of
miss
parlane
madame
did
not
confine
herself
entirely
to
her
own
subjects
she
took
an
interest
in
all
the
activities
of
the
school
it
was
she
who
arranged
a
ramble
on
the
cliffs
they
get
so
hot
playing
at
the
cricket
she
said
to
miss
kingsley
of
what
use
is
it
to
hit
about
a
ball
let
them
come
with
me
for
a
promenade
upon
the
hills
and
we
shall
get
flowers
to
press
for
the
it
is
not
well
to
do
always
the
same
thing
a
ramble
for
the
purpose
of
gathering
was
a
suggestion
that
appealed
to
the
sixth
the
museum
was
not
too
well
furnished
with
specimens
there
was
scope
for
any
amount
of
further
collecting
since
the
curious
episode
of
the
cut
telephone
wires
during
the
easter
holidays
there
had
been
no
further
happenings
at
the
museum
miss
kingsley
inclined
to
madame
bertier
view
that
some
spy
finding
the
window
had
been
left
open
had
taken
a
ladder
and
forced
an
entrance
that
way
she
had
caused
a
screw
to
be
placed
in
the
window
and
the
door
was
kept
carefully
locked
except
when
the
room
was
in
use
to
lorraine
the
place
felt
haunted
she
had
a
horror
of
being
there
alone
and
never
ventured
to
go
there
unless
accompanied
by
two
or
three
of
her
schoolfellows
she
had
an
unreasonable
idea
that
the
little
in
the
corner
might
suddenly
open
and
a
sinister
face
peer
down
out
of
the
darkness
the
nervous
impression
was
so
strong
that
she
held
the
monitresses
meetings
in
the
instead
of
in
the
museum
when
the
beano
came
round
she
suggested
that
they
should
assemble
in
the
it
had
been
an
custom
at
the
school
that
once
in
each
term
the
seniors
should
hold
a
kind
of
they
met
to
read
aloud
papers
and
suck
sweets
their
doings
were
kept
a
dead
secret
from
the
juniors
who
naturally
were
exceedingly
curious
and
made
every
effort
to
overhear
the
proceedings
on
this
occasion
the
seniors
took
elaborate
precautions
against
intrusion
from
the
lower
school
two
monitresses
stood
in
the
and
sternly
chivvied
the
younger
girls
to
hasten
their
steps
homewards
they
went
unwillingly
and
suspiciously
why
are
you
in
such
a
precious
hurry
to
get
rid
of
us
asked
mona
parker
pertly
you
not
generally
so
keen
on
us
going
off
early
there
been
too
much
loitering
about
the
lately
vouchsafed
dorothy
how
conscientious
we
are
all
of
a
sudden
you
something
up
your
sleeve
i
think
madam
dorothy
mona
parker
put
on
your
boots
at
once
and
do
cheek
your
betters
but
there
something
going
on
i
sure
piped
up
josie
payne
nellie
be
a
sport
and
tell
us
mind
your
own
business
and
do
butt
in
where
you
not
wanted
how
long
you
going
to
be
in
lacing
those
shoes
there
there
do
get
ratty
i
ready
now
the
dilatory
juniors
by
dint
of
much
urging
were
at
last
hustled
off
the
scenes
the
ringleaders
among
them
departed
in
rebellious
spirits
which
fizzed
over
in
the
playground
into
a
series
of
aggressive
significant
of
their
attitude
of
annoyance
the
monitresses
wisely
took
no
notice
they
were
too
glad
to
be
rid
of
the
younger
element
to
follow
into
the
playground
and
do
battle
having
cleared
the
premises
they
passed
the
signal
all
serene
and
repaired
to
the
it
was
a
good
place
for
a
secret
meeting
for
it
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
facing
the
main
path
and
a
patch
of
lawn
so
that
it
would
be
quite
impossible
for
anybody
to
come
from
the
house
or
the
gymnasium
without
being
seen
the
accommodation
was
limited
but
some
of
the
girls
sat
on
the
floor
and
some
on
the
gravel
in
front
it
had
been
a
matter
of
considerable
difficulty
to
procure
sweets
and
every
likely
shop
in
the
town
had
been
foraged
the
result
though
not
very
great
was
quite
wonderful
for
there
was
actually
some
chocolate
some
walnut
toffee
two
ounces
of
pear
drops
and
some
gum
lozenges
the
contributions
were
pooled
and
shared
round
impartially
the
members
were
sucking
blissfully
while
lorraine
went
round
and
collected
the
literary
portion
of
the
entertainment
only
eight
papers
you
slackers
audrey
where
yours
had
time
to
think
of
anything
how
weak
doreen
i
expected
the
fifth
to
do
its
duty
thanks
phœbe
i
glad
you
written
something
and
you
too
beryl
please
keep
mine
till
the
last
and
do
read
it
at
all
if
there
is
much
time
implored
phœbe
you
must
read
mine
first
fluttered
dorothy
nor
mine
nor
mine
look
here
somebody
has
got
to
come
first
i
shall
do
it
by
lot
write
your
names
on
slips
of
paper
and
shuffle
them
lend
me
a
pencil
patsie
there
i
stir
them
round
and
audrey
shall
draw
one
audrey
picked
out
at
random
one
of
the
little
twisted
scraps
of
paper
and
the
lot
fell
upon
the
protesting
dorothy
she
rose
apologetically
they
not
much
she
murmured
just
a
few
rhymes
all
anna
maria
fell
into
the
fire
she
was
burnt
to
a
cinder
pa
said
open
winder
in
a
river
in
the
city
jack
was
drowned
and
never
found
mother
said
it
was
a
pity
his
new
boots
went
down
with
him
they
have
fitted
brother
jim
a
bomb
dropped
on
to
the
house
and
blew
beds
tables
and
chairs
to
timbuctoo

how
annoying
murmured
aunt
may
the
place
only
yesterday
poor
little
johnnie
he
swallowed
his
rattle
it
stuck
in
his
throat
and
he
gave
up
life
battle
they
could
get
johnnie
to
eyes
and
but
they
shook
up
the
rattle
and
sold
it
off
cheap
the
next
on
the
list
was
lorraine
own
contribution
diary
of
a
girl
in
the
year
i
used
my
new
air
wings
and
flew
up
the
thames
valley
to
see
the
remains
of
ancient
london
recently
excavated
it
is
an
extraordinary
sight
and
certainly
seems
to
throw
some
light
upon
the
manners
and
customs
of
that
quaint
old
nation
the
english
of
two
thousand
years
ago
in
the
museum
are
some
weird
specimens
of
public
conveyances
notably
a
thing
called
a
tramcar
in
which
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
people
sat
squeezed
up
side
by
side
and
were
whirled
along
the
street
instead
of
the
street
moving
as
it
does
now
to
convey
passengers
without
any
trouble
there
were
also
machines
called
bicycles
consisting
of
two
wheels
and
a
saddle
the
curator
says
they
were
much
used
in
olden
times
though
how
people
balanced
on
them
goodness
knows
not
half
so
convenient
as
our
modern
wings
another
interesting
exhibit
was
a
collection
of
clothing
of
the
nineteenth
and
twentieth
centuries
coats
cloaks
and
dresses
actually
made
of
such
rare
materials
as
cloth
silk
cotton
and
velvet
it
makes
one
gasp
how
beautiful
they
must
have
looked
but
oh
how
insanitary
how
different
to
our
modern
pulp
clothing
that
is
burnt
by
law
every
week
i
am
told
some
of
the
things
used
to
be
sent
to
a
place
called
a
laundry
and
washed
all
together
no
wonder
germs
were
spread
in
those
days
it
is
a
marvel
they
did
not
all
die
off
from
infectious
diseases
there
were
also
some
fine
specimens
of
dishes
upon
which
food
used
to
be
served
interesting
as
survivals
of
an
old
custom
but
amazing
to
us
who
live
on
concentrated
tabloids
the
time
those
ancients
wasted
over
meals
must
have
been
stupendous
some
old
school
books
also
made
me
smile
oh
the
poor
children
of
those
days
fancy
them
sitting
at
desks
and
trying
their
eyes
over
that
wretched
small
print
now
when
all
the
teaching
is
by
cinema
and
gramophone
we
realize
what
a
purgatory
education
must
have
been
in
the
past
i
am
very
thankful
to
be
living
in
with
all
our
modern
advantages
think
of
having
to
go
by
sea
to
visit
your
friends
in
america
when
we
simply
get
out
the
balloon
and
whisk
over
to
pay
a
call
my
new
electric
shoes
have
just
come
and
i
expect
will
be
a
tremendous
aid
to
my
dancing
i
shall
wear
them
at
my
by
the
by
i
must
send
a
wireless
to
connie
to
ask
if
she
means
to
come
to
my
party
she
mentioned
yesterday
that
she
was
flying
to
china
but
perhaps
she
will
be
back
in
time
dad
has
promised
me
a
new
best
diving
boat
for
a
present
so
i
hope
to
do
a
little
ocean
exploring
this
summer
i
hear
the
scenery
at
the
bottom
of
the
pacific
is
most
beautiful
far
finer
than
the
atlantic
which
everybody
knows
now
well
i
must
go
and
start
my
gramophone
or
i
know
my
japanese
lesson
for
professor
okuto
is
the
limit
if
one
slacks
dear
little
diary
i
type
some
more
in
you
another
day
the
girls
giggled
you
gone
ahead
rather
far
commented
audrey
it
sounds
blissful
to
fly
and
use
a
diving
boat
but
i
draw
the
line
at
learning
japanese
oh
it
will
be
one
of
the
languages
of
the
future
no
doubt
lorraine
assured
her
french
will
probably
be
quite
unless
studied
like
greek
and
latin
are
nowadays
i
expect
the
children
of
even
a
few
hundred
years
hence
will
have
awful
times
learning
the
history
of
this
war
said
dorothy
probably
they
know
more
about
it
than
we
shall
ever
do
there
are
generally
secret
facts
that
crop
up
again
after
everybody
is
dead
be
a
for
historians
and
for
rather
audrey
choose
another
scrap
of
paper
and
see
who
next
on
the
list
it
proved
to
be
patsie
and
her
contribution
was
a
collection
of
parodied
proverbs
she
called
them
moral
maxims
for
youthful
minds
take
care
of
the
shrimps
and
the
lobsters
will
boil
themselves
haste
not
pant
not
a
cockroach
saved
is
a
cockroach
gained
a
mouse
in
the
hand
is
worth
two
in
the
hole
treacle
by
any
other
name
would
taste
as
sweet
catch
moths
while
the
moon
shines
all
is
not
mirth
that
titters
a
squashed
slug
dreads
the
spade
it
the
last
sob
that
breaks
the
camel
heart
and
if
a
child
wo
learn
his
maxim
the
teacher
promptly
takes
and
smacks
vivien
who
was
fond
of
rhymes
had
cudgelled
her
brains
for
limericks
and
produced
the
following
nellie
appleby
there
was
once
a
schoolgirl
named
nell
who
fancied
herself
quite
a
swell
with
her
head
in
the
air
and
her
hair
she
reckoned
she
looked
just
a
belle
patsie
sullivan
we
know
a
young
damsel
named
pat
she
big
and
she
floppy
and
fat
when
to
dance
she
begins
we
just
shriek
as
she
spins
and
wonder
whatever
she
at
lorraine
forrester
there
is
a
head
girl
named
lorraine
of
which
fact
i
admit
she
is
vain
she
walks
on
her
toes
with
an
nose
her
dignified
post
to
sustain
audrey
roberts
there
is
a
young
slacker
named
audrey
whose
taste
in
cheap
jewels
is
tawdry
necklace
brooches
and
bangles
she
flaunts
and
she
jangles
and
her
is
just
a
bit
gaudy
dorothy
skipton
i
know
a
young
person
named
dolly
who
ready
for
any
fresh
folly
she
thinks
she
a
wit
and
can
make
quite
a
hit
but
she
tells
a
few
whoppers
my
golly
the
girls
giggled
uneasily
there
was
a
sting
in
each
of
the
verses
and
nobody
likes
to
be
made
fun
of
somehow
vivien
always
stuck
in
pins
we
make
one
about
you
began
patsie
with
a
rather
red
face
there
was
a
young
person
named
vivvie
who
liked
all
her
schoolmates
to
chivvy
but
at
this
point
claudia
suddenly
and
perhaps
rather
fortunately
interrupted
what
that
queer
noise
she
asked
it
sounds
like
a
sort
of
suppressed
giggling
there
was
dead
silence
for
a
moment
i
do
hear
anything
said
lorraine
i
do
though
it
a
kind
of
snorting
i
believe
it
at
the
back
of
the
patsie
dashed
up
and
darted
round
and
with
a
yell
of
vengeance
flung
herself
upon
three
juniors
crouched
with
their
impudent
noses
pressed
to
a
crack
in
the
boards
through
which
they
had
been
spectators
as
well
as
listeners
during
the
proceedings
a
fourth
child
was
in
the
very
act
of
descending
from
the
garden
wall
you
young
blighters
how
dare
you
you
deserve
to
break
your
legs
swarming
over
a
high
wall
like
that
it
would
just
have
served
you
right
if
you
had
and
i
should
have
been
sorry
for
you
not
the
least
teeny
tiny
bit
though
you
limped
about
on
crutches
for
the
rest
of
your
young
lives
come
here
at
once
as
a
speedy
method
of
collecting
the
offenders
patsie
seized
them
by
their
and
hauled
them
in
a
bunch
to
the
front
of
the
lorraine
eyed
them
severely
if
this
had
been
a
masonic
meeting
she
remarked
you
have
been
obliged
to
have
your
heads
chopped
off
for
eavesdropping
freemasons
keep
a
on
duty
so
i
told
to
kill
anybody
who
tries
to
intrude
i
not
sure
if
we
ought
to
do
something
she
paused
as
if
searching
for
a
suitable
punishment
cut
off
their
suggested
patsie
grimly
no
no
yelled
the
interlopers
in
genuine
alarm
i
certainly
shall
if
you
ever
try
to
come
eavesdropping
again
i
give
you
three
seconds
to
get
back
to
the
house
now
then
scoot
the
juniors
did
not
wait
to
be
told
twice
but
with
their
precious
flying
in
the
wind
raced
up
the
garden
at
record
speed
and
disappeared
into
the
gymnasium
lorraine
laughed
as
she
watched
their
long
legs
careering
away
i
afraid
they
heard
the
cream
of
it
she
admitted
it
was
rather
clever
of
them
was
it
that
little
mona
is
the
limit
she
leads
all
the
others
i
shall
make
a
point
of
sitting
upon
her
hard
for
the
rest
of
the
term
solomon
said
in
accents
mild
the
rod
and
spoil
the
child
be
they
man
or
be
they
maid
whack
them
and
wollop
them
solomon
said
quoted
patsie
choking
over
her
last
piece
of
chocolate
chapter
xviii
an
adventure
to
give
madame
bertier
her
dues
it
was
she
who
suggested
the
ramble
upon
the
cliffs
it
was
for
seniors
only
and
it
had
the
immense
advantage
in
schoolgirl
eyes
that
it
was
held
upon
a
thursday
afternoon
madame
had
urged
thursday
and
stuck
to
the
point
it
was
real
sporty
of
her
chortled
patsie
miss
kingsley
or
miss
janet
always
try
to
fix
up
rambles
or
things
of
that
kind
for
saturdays
and
then
it
taking
away
a
holiday
instead
of
giving
us
one
we
all
generally
got
something
on
at
home
for
saturday
afternoons
and
though
of
course
we
like
rambles
all
right
it
is
quite
good
enough
to
have
to
throw
up
our
home
engagements
for
them
three
cheers
for
madame
bless
her
murmured
audrey
ecstatically
we
shall
miss
french
on
thursday
afternoon
and
i
had
done
a
single
line
of
my
exercise
or
learnt
my
poetry
it
moved
a
weight
from
my
mind
do
congratulate
yourself
too
soon
old
sport
she
probably
tell
us
to
give
in
the
exercises
well
she
ca
hear
the
poetry
at
any
rate
unless
she
makes
us
say
it
on
the
cliffs
oh
surely
there
wo
be
time
for
that
um
i
do
know
never
trust
a
teacher
to
give
one
a
holiday
miss
janet
always
tries
to
instruction
with
amusement
as
the
children
books
used
to
put
it
madame
will
probably
try
to
teach
us
the
french
names
of
the
flowers
at
any
rate
perhaps
she
does
know
them
said
audrey
hopefully
there
were
eighteen
seniors
in
the
school
and
on
the
thursday
in
question
they
were
all
ready
by
two
armed
with
baskets
or
tin
cases
in
which
to
put
their
flowers
their
exodus
was
watched
with
envy
by
the
juniors
who
had
appealed
in
vain
to
be
allowed
to
join
the
excursion
eighteen
are
quite
a
big
enough
party
to
keep
together
decreed
miss
kingsley
and
you
juniors
had
an
aquarium
expedition
only
last
week
but
that
was
on
a
saturday
objected
a
valiant
spirit
anxious
to
obtain
a
thursday
holiday
miss
kingsley
however
could
or
would
see
the
point
and
withered
the
speaker
with
an
glare
the
elder
girls
were
not
at
all
sorry
to
be
going
alone
they
clung
to
their
privileges
as
seniors
most
tenaciously
we
do
want
the
whole
and
bobtail
of
the
school
trailing
after
us
said
dorothy
it
quite
enough
in
my
opinion
to
include
the
fifth
i
hate
marching
about
in
a
troop
like
trippers
well
we
can
spread
out
when
we
get
on
to
the
cliffs
there
no
need
to
be
so
fearfully
particular
to
keep
together
madame
bertier
among
her
many
other
accomplishments
possessed
some
knowledge
of
botany
she
had
studied
the
wild
flora
of
the
district
and
knew
where
to
take
the
girls
to
secure
a
variety
of
the
best
specimens
the
walk
she
chose
was
down
a
lane
over
some
fields
and
across
a
portion
of
the
moor
where
lorraine
who
thought
she
knew
all
the
neighbourhood
of
porthkeverne
had
never
happened
to
go
before
as
in
most
rambles
of
the
sort
it
was
a
difficult
task
for
the
mistress
to
keep
all
the
members
of
her
flock
in
sight
some
were
always
on
ahead
and
others
lagging
behind
while
a
few
would
make
detours
over
gates
or
banks
in
quest
of
particular
specimens
there
was
the
usual
amount
of
jodelling
cuckooing
and
calling
and
running
back
to
fetch
laggers
there
was
frantic
excitement
over
a
patch
of
wild
strawberries
and
great
congratulation
when
several
rare
flowers
were
found
and
carefully
put
away
in
tin
cases
as
generally
happens
in
natural
history
rambles
there
was
decided
rivalry
among
the
numerous
budding
botanists
each
wanted
to
be
the
first
to
secure
a
new
specimen
and
to
take
it
in
triumph
to
show
to
madame
lorraine
who
was
not
superior
to
the
common
weakness
had
not
yet
had
any
luck
at
all
seeing
the
others
heading
in
a
for
a
small
tower
on
the
hill
and
knowing
she
could
catch
them
up
there
she
determined
to
branch
off
to
the
left
cross
a
dyke
and
go
by
herself
over
a
particularly
piece
of
the
moor
if
she
were
quick
she
would
probably
reach
the
tower
as
soon
as
most
of
the
others
they
would
be
sure
to
sit
down
there
to
rest
and
compare
specimens
she
would
have
asked
claudia
to
go
with
her
but
claudia
was
on
in
front
talking
to
dorothy
if
i
jodel
to
her
it
will
give
the
show
away
thought
lorraine
no
i
must
do
it
on
my
own
so
she
jumped
a
dyke
scrambled
down
a
bank
and
in
a
few
minutes
had
reached
a
tract
of
wild
land
that
adjoined
the
cliff
small
bushes
bracken
and
brambles
mixed
among
the
heather
made
walking
difficult
and
there
were
several
boggy
places
which
she
was
obliged
to
skirt
this
took
her
farther
than
she
had
intended
looking
round
she
could
not
see
her
landmark
the
tower
it
must
be
over
there
to
the
right
she
said
to
herself
hallo
what
a
gorgeous
silver
fritillary
i
get
it
if
i
possibly
can
lorraine
was
rather
keen
on
entomology
and
though
she
had
no
net
with
her
she
pulled
off
her
hat
and
ran
in
eager
pursuit
of
the
butterfly
it
was
an
exciting
chase
several
times
she
nearly
secured
it
but
it
managed
to
elude
her
and
flitted
tantalizingly
away
at
last
it
paused
and
hovered
then
settled
on
a
spray
of
wild
rose
lorraine
crept
up
stealthily
hat
in
hand
surely
she
had
her
prize
now
but
just
at
the
critical
moment
again
the
lovely
wings
fluttered
she
made
a
grab
and
a
dash
forward
simultaneously
then
suddenly
the
earth
seemed
to
open
and
swallow
her
up
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
fell
about
nine
feet
and
lodged
on
a
heap
of
shale
it
was
so
totally
unexpected
and
so
amazing
that
she
lay
there
for
a
moment
or
two
almost
stunned
then
she
moved
cautiously
and
sat
up
she
realized
what
had
happened
in
her
mad
rush
after
the
butterfly
she
had
not
noticed
where
she
was
going
and
she
had
fallen
down
the
shaft
of
an
old
above
her
were
its
rocky
sides
with
bushes
and
a
patch
of
blue
sky
at
the
top
below
the
ledge
where
she
sat
it
sloped
away
towards
a
black
hole
lorraine
still
a
little
dazed
shuddered
as
she
looked
down
in
the
direction
of
that
dark
pit
she
was
unhurt
and
she
was
safe
enough
on
the
edge
of
the
shale
but
how
was
she
to
get
up
to
the
level
of
the
ground
above
the
sides
of
the
shaft
were
far
too
steep
to
climb
and
a
slip
might
mean
a
plunge
down
down
down
into
that
horrible
depth
that
loomed
below
she
stood
up
cautiously
and
shouted
with
all
the
force
of
her
lungs
there
was
no
reply
again
and
again
she
called
but
beyond
the
of
a
blackbird
there
was
no
response
she
began
to
grow
seriously
frightened
she
must
be
some
distance
from
the
tower
and
she
had
wandered
from
the
rest
of
the
party
suppose
nobody
heard
her
calling
the
bare
idea
sent
her
breath
in
gasps
in
time
no
doubt
they
would
notice
her
absence
but
they
would
not
exactly
know
where
to
search
for
her
they
might
even
imagine
that
she
had
gone
home
suppose
the
night
came
on
before
she
was
found
suppose
even
days
were
to
pass
and
nobody
remembered
the
disused
mine
or
thought
of
looking
for
her
there
with
white
cheeks
and
trembling
hand
she
leaned
against
the
side
of
the
shaft
and
called
with
what
breath
she
could
still
muster
there
was
a
rustling
among
the
heather
above
and
a
face
suddenly
blocked
the
blue
of
the
sky
a
vacant
face
that
peered
down
with
the
curiosity
of
a
child
lorraine
gave
a
fluttering
cry
of
relief
landry
she
called
landry
how
or
from
where
he
appeared
she
could
not
guess
though
it
was
possible
that
he
had
seen
the
school
passing
near
windy
howe
and
had
followed
claudia
in
the
distance
he
stared
down
at
lorraine
with
a
certain
amount
of
interest
but
as
much
unconcern
as
if
she
were
a
bird
or
a
rabbit
landry
she
cried
again
claudia
is
up
by
the
tower
go
and
tell
her
i
have
fallen
down
the
old
mine
the
bushes
rustled
and
once
more
that
patch
of
blue
sky
appeared
above
landry
had
gone
indeed
but
would
he
bring
help
lorraine
feared
that
all
he
cared
about
was
to
find
claudia
and
that
with
his
customary
taciturnity
it
was
quite
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
that
he
might
never
mention
her
predicament
at
all
illustration
she
stood
up
cautiously
she
waited
a
while
and
then
shouted
and
kept
on
calling
at
intervals
her
wrist
watch
told
her
she
had
been
nearly
an
hour
down
the
shaft
would
help
never
come
she
was
very
tired
and
her
head
swam
if
she
were
to
faint
nothing
could
save
her
from
falling
down
into
that
black
gulf
below
her
voice
was
growing
weaker
it
seemed
stifled
inside
the
shaft
what
was
that
sound
in
the
distance
surely
a
shout
with
all
her
remaining
energy
she
raised
her
voice
in
a
wild
halloo
next
moment
dorothy
peeped
over
the
bushes
and
turned
with
a
cry
to
summon
claudia
though
she
was
found
it
was
more
than
an
hour
before
adequate
help
could
be
fetched
from
a
farm
but
at
last
two
men
appeared
carrying
a
ladder
which
they
lowered
down
the
shaft
on
to
the
ledge
of
shale
then
one
of
them
descended
and
helped
lorraine
to
mount
madame
and
a
thrilled
group
of
girls
were
waiting
for
her
at
the
top
did
landry
tell
you
lorraine
asked
claudia
yes
he
told
me
and
brought
me
to
the
place
said
claudia
landry
may
be
very
proud
of
himself
the
dear
boy
that
mine
did
ought
to
be
fenced
round
remarked
one
of
the
men
who
had
brought
the
ladder
tremayne
been
warned
about
it
many
a
time
but
he
always
put
off
having
it
done
ah
yes
it
must
be
fenced
exclaimed
madame
hysterically
élève
if
she
had
fallen
a
little
farther
what
then
the
man
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
lorraine
who
had
been
sitting
on
the
grass
sprang
to
her
feet
she
implored
please
say
any
more
about
it
i
want
to
get
away
from
the
place
i
know
i
shall
dream
it
over
again
all
night
let
me
go
straight
home
i
do
want
to
get
any
more
flowers
i
want
just
to
be
quiet
and
forget
about
it
if
i
can
chapter
xix
morland
on
leave
at
the
end
of
june
morland
came
home
on
leave
he
looked
well
in
his
khaki
military
training
and
had
already
worked
wonders
with
his
physique
his
lanky
overgrown
aspect
had
disappeared
his
chest
measure
had
increased
and
he
proudly
showed
the
muscle
in
his
arm
his
father
always
with
an
eye
to
artistic
effects
wished
to
sketch
him
for
a
picture
of
hector
and
indeed
with
his
classic
profile
and
short
crisp
curly
golden
hair
he
would
have
made
a
capital
representation
of
that
trojan
hero
but
morland
absolutely
struck
at
the
suggestion
of
sitting
as
model
declaring
that
he
meant
to
enjoy
himself
during
his
brief
leave
and
should
not
even
show
his
nose
inside
the
studio
dad
must
paint
the
kids
he
confided
to
claudia
i
fed
up
with
portraits
do
even
mean
to
have
my
photo
taken
if
i
can
help
it
you
remember
that
picture
of
me
when
i
was
about
five
darling
it
came
out
as
a
coloured
christmas
supplement
and
was
stuck
up
in
everybody
nursery
well
they
got
to
know
at
the
camp
that
i
was
the
original
of
it
and
they
led
me
a
life
i
can
tell
you
christened
me
darling
i
not
going
to
be
or
anybody
else
it
is
good
enough
i
sometimes
wish
i
were
as
dark
as
a
gipsy
and
had
a
broken
nose
they
could
call
me
lady
then
do
you
know
they
caught
me
once
and
held
me
down
and
tied
a
blue
ribbon
round
my
neck
i
gave
them
something
back
though
for
ragging
me
they
did
get
it
all
their
own
way
indeed
wait
till
i
out
at
the
front
and
i
show
them
who
the
poor
old
boy
it
seems
to
rankle
consoled
claudia
laughingly
i
should
think
it
probably
envy
on
their
part
they
wish
they
could
send
as
a
photo
home
to
be
put
in
a
locket
just
forget
them
while
you
on
leave
we
try
to
do
something
jolly
what
would
you
like
best
it
saturday
so
i
at
your
disposal
shall
we
go
for
a
picnic
somewhere
yes
if
the
kids
do
trail
after
us
i
do
bargain
to
take
beata
romola
madox
lilith
constable
perugia
and
perhaps
the
baby
in
its
pram
you
sha
i
see
to
that
just
landry
and
i
go
and
we
tell
the
small
fry
we
off
how
about
the
grotto
i
ask
lorraine
to
come
with
us
the
tide
will
be
just
right
to
get
round
the
rocks
so
we
take
our
lunch
and
eat
it
there
lorraine
shamelessly
regardless
of
appointments
at
the
dentist
and
dressmaker
accepted
the
invitation
and
joined
the
party
with
a
it
was
an
ideal
day
for
the
excursion
the
warm
sunshine
was
tempered
by
a
cool
breeze
blowing
in
straight
from
the
atlantic
the
sea
had
assumed
its
summer
hue
of
intense
and
the
cliffs
were
covered
with
the
beautiful
crimson
wild
geranium
the
young
people
loitered
along
in
no
particular
hurry
looking
out
to
sea
at
the
vessels
picking
flowers
or
wild
strawberries
or
even
a
few
early
dewberries
as
they
wound
up
the
path
by
the
station
they
heard
voices
behind
them
and
a
little
party
consisting
of
an
officer
and
two
ladies
passed
them
walking
briskly
in
the
direction
of
the
moors
morland
who
had
saluted
turned
to
the
girls
with
an
eloquent
face
it
blake
our
captain
he
explained
i
saw
him
travelling
down
on
thursday
and
i
believe
he
staying
at
the
do
you
like
him
asked
claudia
like
him
if
there
one
man
on
the
face
of
the
earth
whom
i
abhor
that
fellow
thinks
he
the
shah
of
persia
and
we
dirt
under
his
feet
he
not
popular
i
can
tell
you
he
makes
my
blood
boil
sometimes
he
dropped
something
said
lorraine
bending
down
and
picking
up
a
small
leather
dispatch
case
that
was
lying
by
the
side
of
the
pathway
she
handed
it
to
morland
could
you
run
after
him
and
give
it
to
him
suggested
claudia
to
her
brother
i
sha
trouble
myself
he
gone
too
far
we
can
leave
it
at
his
hotel
afterwards
then
i
suppose
we
can
though
if
he
flings
his
things
about
like
this
he
does
deserve
to
have
them
returned
to
him
the
blighter
groused
morland
pocketing
the
case
with
a
frown
i
wish
blake
was
taking
his
leave
somewhere
else
i
rather
not
breathe
the
same
air
with
him
is
it
as
bad
as
all
that
asked
claudia
worse
said
morland
gloomily
but
i
do
want
to
talk
about
him
he
the
skeleton
at
the
feast
the
crumpled
the
snake
in
the
paradise
the
anything
else
you
like
that
spoils
my
enjoyment
rather
mixed
similes
laughed
lorraine
but
never
mind
we
forget
him
if
you
like
he
certainly
did
look
at
all
attractive
in
my
opinion
morland
pulled
a
face
and
shook
a
fist
in
the
direction
in
which
his
officer
had
disappeared
then
declared
himself
better
and
ready
to
jog
along
they
found
their
special
property
the
cave
still
uninvaded
no
visitors
had
yet
happened
to
come
across
it
the
table
and
seats
and
the
little
cupboard
at
the
end
were
just
exactly
as
they
had
left
them
last
time
they
collected
some
driftwood
lighted
a
fire
on
the
rocks
below
and
boiled
their
kettle
it
was
delightful
to
have
a
picnic
again
in
the
grotto
as
they
sat
chatting
afterwards
morland
pulled
from
his
pocket
the
leather
case
which
captain
blake
had
dropped
on
the
path
he
turned
it
over
thoughtfully
i
a
score
or
two
to
settle
with
the
owner
of
this
he
remarked
i
not
going
to
let
him
have
it
back
too
easily
i
vote
we
just
give
him
a
scare
about
it
let
him
think
he
lost
it
altogether
is
it
anything
important
i
wonder
asked
claudia
the
more
important
the
better
serve
him
right
for
losing
it
i
say
i
going
to
stow
it
away
here
in
the
cupboard
it
be
quite
safe
but
he
wo
know
that
and
i
hope
he
be
in
a
jolly
state
of
mind
about
it
we
give
him
a
fortnight
to
get
excited
in
then
you
girls
can
come
and
fetch
it
make
it
into
a
parcel
and
leave
it
at
the
and
ask
them
to
send
it
on
to
him
at
the
camp
it
would
really
serve
him
right
sympathised
claudia
only
i
quite
know
i
know
chuckled
morland
it
the
best
rag
i
ever
had
the
chance
of
playing
on
him
and
you
bet
i
take
it
suppose
he
finds
out
suggested
lorraine
he
wo
find
out
how
could
he
you
girls
will
just
leave
the
parcel
at
the
and
say
someone
who
picked
it
up
had
handed
it
over
to
you
and
will
they
please
forward
it
to
the
officer
who
was
staying
there
nothing
could
be
simpler
are
those
the
papers
that
send
morland
to
the
war
asked
landry
suddenly
do
you
worry
your
head
about
them
answered
claudia
soothingly
they
nothing
to
do
with
you
landry
i
do
want
morland
to
fight
persisted
the
boy
morland
sha
go
to
the
war
i
be
off
some
day
old
sport
laughed
morland
no
no
not
but
before
so
very
long
i
hope
will
the
germans
shoot
at
you
you
jolly
well
bet
they
will
do
excite
him
morland
interfered
claudia
for
when
landry
once
woke
out
of
his
usual
stolid
calm
and
began
to
trouble
his
poor
dull
brains
with
questions
he
was
apt
to
get
peevish
and
troublesome
no
no
landry
dear
morland
is
quite
safe
at
present
and
we
wo
let
the
germans
get
him
take
this
basket
down
to
the
beach
and
find
me
some
more
shells
i
want
some
yellow
ones
to
finish
the
pattern
i
was
making
on
the
ledge
here
claudia
was
an
adept
at
managing
landry
and
could
keep
the
boy
quiet
and
change
the
current
of
his
impulses
when
others
only
irritated
him
she
put
a
basket
in
his
hand
and
a
yellow
shell
for
a
pattern
led
him
by
the
arm
to
the
mouth
of
the
grotto
and
showed
him
the
spot
on
the
beach
where
he
would
be
likely
to
find
more
to
her
relief
he
departed
quite
happily
on
the
errand
she
had
been
afraid
he
was
on
the
verge
of
a
burst
of
temper
she
turned
to
her
other
brother
i
a
great
deal
rather
you
took
that
officer
case
back
to
him
right
at
once
morland
but
morland
was
in
a
mood
he
not
to
have
it
for
a
fortnight
if
i
do
leave
it
in
the
cupboard
here
i
shall
just
chuck
it
into
the
sea
so
i
give
you
full
and
fair
warning
be
a
sport
claudia
here
lorraine
ready
to
see
the
fun
of
it
are
you
lorraine
neither
of
the
girls
was
really
quite
easy
about
the
propriety
of
thus
hiding
the
officer
papers
but
to
please
morland
they
consented
to
do
as
he
wished
and
to
come
again
in
a
fortnight
to
fetch
them
after
all
it
seemed
only
a
sort
of
practical
joke
and
to
judge
from
accounts
ragging
was
very
much
in
fashion
at
his
camp
among
the
tommies
at
any
rate
so
long
as
captain
blake
did
not
find
out
who
had
kept
the
leather
case
there
would
be
no
trouble
and
they
thought
he
deserved
some
punishment
for
his
arrogant
behaviour
towards
his
men
it
was
a
concession
which
they
afterwards
deeply
regretted
chapter
xx
smugglers
cove
morland
leave
ended
on
sunday
night
and
by
monday
morning
both
he
and
his
superior
officer
were
back
in
camp
claudia
came
to
school
in
an
unusually
quiet
and
depressed
frame
of
mind
yes
i
miss
morland
she
acknowledged
to
lorraine
but
it
altogether
that
i
worried
about
him
perhaps
it
silly
of
me
but
i
ca
help
it
i
know
i
ca
expect
him
to
keep
a
boy
always
yet
one
feels
that
growing
up
ought
to
be
growing
into
something
better
not
worse
honestly
between
ourselves
i
do
think
madame
bertier
has
a
good
influence
over
him
he
always
fearfully
taken
with
her
absolutely
infatuated
she
fascinates
him
just
as
she
does
vivien
and
dorothy
and
some
of
the
girls
at
school
and
she
encourages
him
in
things
he
much
better
let
alone
she
was
up
at
windy
howe
on
sunday
and
took
morland
off
for
a
long
walk
although
he
promised
to
stay
at
home
that
last
afternoon
they
went
along
the
cliffs
towards
tangy
point
do
think
i
jealous
but
i
really
feel
angry
with
her
carrying
him
away
from
his
family
when
he
only
a
few
hours
left
of
his
leave
i
hope
he
did
show
her
our
cave
asked
lorraine
quickly
i
hope
not
but
i
think
it
extremely
probable
oh
yes
i
know
he
promised
to
keep
the
secret
but
he
beginning
to
say
that
our
secrets
are
childish
and
not
worth
keeping
i
several
times
heard
madame
asking
him
if
he
knew
of
any
caves
along
the
coast
if
she
asked
persistently
enough
he
be
sure
to
tell
her
i
know
morland
why
is
she
so
keen
on
caves
claudia
shrugged
her
shoulders
there
are
a
great
many
about
madame
that
i
ca
answer
the
sort
of
woman
you
read
about
in
a
novel
she
bewitched
most
people
at
porthkeverne
i
own
she
very
nice
and
pleasant
and
when
i
with
her
i
even
fall
under
the
spell
a
little
and
almost
like
her
but
all
the
time
at
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
do
trust
her
at
all
whatever
claudia
private
opinion
might
be
of
madame
bertier
that
pretty
russian
lady
was
very
popular
in
the
artistic
and
literary
circles
of
the
town
she
was
always
ready
to
pose
as
model
or
to
play
her
violin
at
concerts
or
at
homes
she
was
capital
company
had
a
fine
sense
of
humour
and
could
keep
a
whole
room
full
of
people
amused
with
her
lively
chatter
in
addition
to
her
engagement
at
the
gables
she
had
now
a
number
of
private
pupils
in
porthkeverne
and
had
established
quite
a
connection
for
lessons
in
french
russian
and
music
on
the
subject
of
her
husband
she
was
guarded
but
it
was
generally
understood
that
he
was
a
prisoner
in
germany
and
that
she
sent
him
parcels
lorraine
with
a
remembrance
of
that
brief
sentence
she
had
overheard
at
burlington
house
often
wondered
if
that
were
the
case
madame
academy
portrait
had
been
considered
quite
one
of
the
pictures
of
the
year
it
had
been
reproduced
in
art
journals
and
illustrated
papers
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
critics
was
almost
best
piece
of
work
to
lorraine
great
joy
kilmeny
also
came
in
for
a
share
of
notice
in
the
newspaper
reviews
and
one
day
a
letter
arrived
at
the
studio
by
the
harbour
containing
a
special
invitation
for
the
picture
to
be
exhibited
at
an
important
provincial
art
gallery
in
the
autumn
such
invitations
are
the
swallows
of
an
artist
summer
of
success
and
margaret
lindsay
eyes
shone
as
she
showed
lorraine
the
official
document
with
the
city
arms
heading
the
paper
you
been
my
mascot
you
see
she
said
brightly
i
tried
to
get
into
that
particular
exhibition
time
after
time
and
always
had
my
pictures
rejected
and
now
just
to
think
that
i
specially
invited
and
a
place
of
honour
kept
for
my
i
feel
an
inch
taller
i
must
paint
you
in
the
sunset
again
lorraine
lorraine
curled
up
on
the
turning
over
art
magazines
shook
her
head
do
repeat
yourself
she
advised
why
not
paint
the
dawn
instead
it
just
as
beautiful
as
sunset
more
so
i
think
and
would
give
you
a
different
scheme
of
colour
all
opal
and
pearly
pink
instead
of
golden
and
brown
ca
you
choose
some
other
heroine
yes
the
dawn
princess
i
can
see
her
in
imagination
standing
at
the
edge
of
the
waves
with
a
rosy
sky
behind
her
and
trails
of
under
her
bare
feet
i
believe
it
would
be
a
companion
picture
to
if
i
can
paint
it
in
time
i
see
if
the
art
gallery
will
consent
to
exhibit
the
pair
i
actually
getting
ambitious
will
you
stand
as
model
again
with
all
the
pleasure
in
life
any
time
and
anywhere
you
want
me
yours
to
command
a
good
and
adequate
picture
of
the
dawn
was
not
so
easy
to
paint
as
a
sunset
they
were
on
the
west
coast
and
in
order
to
get
the
effect
of
the
sun
rising
over
the
sea
it
was
necessary
to
be
on
some
promontory
where
they
could
look
eastwards
over
a
stretch
of
water
the
only
headland
which
answered
the
required
points
of
the
compass
was
tor
point
which
jutted
out
in
a
curve
from
the
mainland
with
the
whole
of
pendragon
bay
between
it
and
the
opposite
point
of
the
coast
the
sandy
beach
under
its
shelter
had
been
named
smugglers
cove
it
was
several
miles
away
from
porthkeverne
so
unless
they
could
walk
there
by
moonlight
it
would
be
quite
impossible
to
reach
it
in
time
to
witness
from
the
beach
the
spectacle
of
dawn
a
moonlight
scramble
over
cliffs
and
rocks
might
be
highly
romantic
but
not
altogether
a
safe
proceeding
and
margaret
lindsay
had
a
better
suggestion
to
offer
we
take
my
little
and
pitch
it
on
the
shore
in
some
sheltered
place
and
spend
the
night
there
there
will
be
just
room
for
us
both
to
cram
in
and
with
a
rug
each
we
should
keep
quite
warm
then
we
shall
be
all
ready
and
prepared
for
the
dawn
the
moment
it
comes
the
weather
was
so
warm
that
there
were
no
objections
to
and
forrester
quite
readily
gave
permission
for
the
expedition
you
such
a
person
muvvie
dear
gasped
lorraine
ecstatically
some
mothers
would
have
howled
at
such
a
plan
i
sure
aunt
carrie
would
have
let
vivien
go
you
always
seem
to
see
things
just
from
the
same
point
of
view
as
we
do
ourselves
i
know
you
be
safe
with
margaret
lindsay
or
i
would
let
you
stir
five
yards
from
my
apron
strings
i
could
be
a
dragon
of
a
mother
if
the
occasion
required
laughed
forrester
so
far
happily
never
wanted
to
do
anything
especially
outrageous
i
can
see
no
harm
in
your
on
the
beach
just
for
one
night
i
should
be
a
very
unreasonable
person
if
i
objected
but
then
you
muvvie
and
nobody
else
you
see
said
lorraine
dropping
a
kiss
on
the
dear
brown
hair
that
was
just
turning
grey
so
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
very
tuesday
evening
after
morland
had
returned
to
camp
margaret
lindsay
and
lorraine
shouldered
rugs
and
and
trudged
out
to
giant
tor
point
they
arrived
there
about
sunset
and
found
a
quiet
sheltered
spot
among
the
rocks
well
above
mark
where
they
pitched
their
tent
there
was
not
a
soul
in
sight
they
seemed
to
have
the
whole
of
the
headland
and
the
bay
entirely
to
themselves
it
was
a
calm
warm
evening
and
the
waves
lapped
gently
upon
the
beach
the
sand
in
the
spot
they
had
chosen
was
dry
so
they
piled
up
heaps
of
it
for
pillows
and
laid
down
their
rugs
then
having
completed
these
preparations
opened
their
baskets
and
had
a
picnic
supper
the
sunset
had
faded
by
that
time
and
a
full
moon
was
shining
over
the
bay
glinting
on
the
waves
and
lighting
up
the
outlines
of
the
crags
on
the
headland
the
silence
was
broken
only
by
the
gentle
purring
of
the
waves
on
the
pebbles
or
the
call
of
some
the
calm
stillness
was
beautiful
beyond
description
it
was
like
a
glimpse
into
another
world
where
all
petty
struggles
and
troubles
had
faded
away
it
needed
an
effort
to
leave
the
beautiful
moonlight
and
go
to
bed
inside
the
tent
but
they
tore
themselves
away
from
it
at
last
and
rolled
themselves
up
in
their
rugs
it
was
a
long
time
before
either
of
them
slept
the
unusual
circumstances
their
cramped
position
and
the
of
the
waves
made
them
keenly
on
the
alert
though
lorraine
would
not
have
confessed
it
for
worlds
she
found
the
situation
a
trifle
eerie
she
thought
she
heard
noises
in
the
distance
and
recalled
tales
of
smugglers
and
wreckers
and
coves
she
was
glad
to
have
margaret
close
beside
her
there
was
comfort
in
the
sense
of
contact
with
something
human
not
till
after
midnight
did
she
fall
into
a
troubled
sleep
when
she
awoke
the
moon
had
passed
across
the
sky
and
the
first
hint
of
dawn
was
in
the
air
margaret
had
flung
back
her
rug
and
was
stepping
out
of
the
tent
lorraine
followed
her
shivering
a
little
for
the
morning
air
was
chilly
everything
was
wreathed
in
pearly
shadows
and
the
headland
loomed
like
a
grey
mass
of
mist
with
the
sea
for
a
silver
lake
below
each
moment
the
light
seemed
to
grow
stronger
and
what
at
first
had
appeared
mere
clumps
of
darkness
resolved
themselves
into
rocks
or
banks
of
at
the
far
side
of
the
bay
behind
the
hill
the
sky
was
changing
from
pearl
to
rose
margaret
whose
paints
were
ready
began
to
set
up
her
easel
to
sketch
the
evanescent
effect
without
delay
but
just
as
she
was
putting
in
the
pegs
lorraine
nudged
her
and
pointed
at
the
end
of
the
cove
where
the
bay
merged
into
the
open
sea
there
had
suddenly
arisen
a
strange
object
they
both
looked
at
it
and
both
at
the
same
moment
realized
what
it
was
neither
more
or
less
than
the
conning
tower
of
a
margaret
hastily
pulled
down
her
easel
and
drew
lorraine
behind
the
shelter
of
some
rocks
she
judged
that
if
a
were
so
near
to
the
coast
then
somebody
in
collusion
with
the
enemy
must
be
about
on
the
shore
nor
was
she
mistaken
they
had
hardly
concealed
themselves
when
voices
were
heard
quite
a
short
distance
away
and
the
grating
sound
of
a
boat
being
pushed
along
the
shingle
in
the
gathering
brightness
of
the
dawn
they
could
see
not
a
hundred
yards
off
the
entrance
to
a
cave
from
which
two
men
were
taking
some
barrels
they
rolled
them
down
the
beach
and
with
apparent
difficulty
hoisted
them
into
a
small
boat
so
intent
were
they
on
their
occupation
that
they
never
glanced
in
the
direction
of
the
rock
where
margaret
and
lorraine
were
concealed
the
fortunately
was
round
a
corner
and
out
of
sight
no
doubt
they
imagined
that
in
that
early
hour
of
the
morning
they
had
the
cove
to
themselves
two
anxious
pairs
of
eyes
however
were
watching
them
narrowly
and
making
a
mental
register
of
their
actions
as
the
men
went
back
to
fetch
more
barrels
they
were
met
by
a
third
companion
who
issued
from
the
cave
he
stood
for
a
moment
speaking
to
them
and
looking
out
over
the
water
towards
the
conning
tower
of
the
the
first
rays
of
the
rising
sun
fell
full
on
his
face
as
she
watched
him
standing
there
in
the
sunlight
with
the
background
of
the
dark
cave
behind
him
some
detached
links
in
lorraine
memory
suddenly
welded
themselves
together
and
formed
a
continuous
chain
in
a
flash
she
recollected
where
she
had
seen
him
before
he
was
the
man
who
had
tried
to
take
the
photo
of
the
hockey
field
and
of
the
golf
links
in
the
autumn
and
not
only
that
but
she
could
almost
be
sure
that
he
was
identical
with
the
stranger
who
had
met
madame
bertier
on
the
beach
and
the
foreigner
who
had
admired
her
picture
in
the
academy
the
sudden
discovery
almost
stunned
her
she
realized
all
it
might
mean
it
was
evident
enough
what
the
men
were
doing
they
had
a
secret
store
of
barrels
of
oil
inside
the
cave
and
were
taking
them
out
to
supply
the
they
were
in
a
hurry
and
the
business
did
not
last
long
their
cargo
was
soon
complete
the
boat
pushed
off
and
was
making
its
way
along
the
side
of
the
cove
to
the
place
where
the
conning
tower
still
showed
like
a
blot
on
the
water
as
soon
as
it
seemed
safe
to
move
from
their
margaret
and
lorraine
dodged
round
the
rocks
and
abandoning
tent
easel
and
painting
accessories
climbed
up
the
and
tramped
home
across
the
moor
to
porthkeverne
with
all
possible
speed
they
were
sure
that
what
they
had
witnessed
ought
to
be
reported
at
once
so
they
went
straight
to
the
police
station
and
told
their
amazing
story
the
constable
listened
attentively
jotting
down
points
in
his
notebook
asked
various
questions
and
took
their
names
and
addresses
he
was
guarded
in
his
communications
but
he
thanked
them
for
coming
i
may
have
to
call
on
you
for
more
help
he
remarked
thoughtfully
then
turning
to
lorraine
i
suppose
you
at
home
if
i
chance
to
want
you
you
find
me
at
school
at
the
gables
until
four
he
nodded
and
made
another
entry
in
his
notebook
then
dismissing
them
courteously
rang
up
his
chief
on
the
telephone
lorraine
went
home
to
breakfast
feeling
as
if
she
had
suddenly
stepped
into
the
pages
of
a
detective
story
that
some
treachery
was
taking
place
at
porthkeverne
was
beyond
question
loyal
subjects
of
king
george
do
not
supply
with
casks
of
oil
and
the
man
whom
she
had
seen
was
palpably
no
british
subject
but
a
foreigner
she
wondered
what
the
next
step
in
the
course
of
events
would
be
and
what
help
she
would
be
able
to
render
the
answer
to
her
surmisings
came
from
a
direction
she
had
not
anticipated
she
had
only
been
at
school
about
an
hour
and
was
at
work
on
a
piece
of
unseen
latin
translation
when
a
message
was
brought
to
her
summoning
her
to
the
study
she
found
her
uncle
barton
there
talking
to
miss
janet
lorraine
he
said
briefly
miss
kingsley
has
excused
your
lessons
get
your
hat
and
coat
and
come
with
me
for
i
want
to
take
you
by
train
we
just
time
to
catch
the
if
we
quick
much
excited
and
puzzled
lorraine
flew
to
the
and
donned
her
outdoor
shoes
and
hat
with
lightning
speed
what
was
going
to
happen
next
in
this
amazing
chain
of
events
on
the
way
to
the
station
uncle
barton
explained
the
police
have
long
been
trying
to
catch
a
notorious
spy
and
from
the
description
you
gave
this
morning
they
think
they
are
on
the
right
track
of
the
man
they
want
a
certain
foreigner
at
cyr
is
under
observation
but
they
can
not
arrest
him
without
a
witness
to
his
identity
if
you
can
certify
that
to
the
best
of
your
knowledge
he
is
the
man
whom
you
saw
this
morning
supplying
casks
of
oil
to
a
then
the
police
can
act
should
you
know
him
again
if
you
saw
him
i
remember
him
anywhere
now
declared
lorraine
it
was
a
comparatively
short
journey
to
cyr
and
on
arrival
there
they
went
straight
to
the
police
station
they
were
shown
by
a
constable
into
a
private
office
where
they
were
shortly
joined
by
a
detective
he
questioned
lorraine
carefully
as
to
the
various
occasions
on
which
she
had
seen
the
suspected
foreigner
a
man
answering
exactly
to
that
description
has
been
staying
at
a
in
spring
terrace
he
commented
we
happen
to
know
that
he
was
out
all
last
night
and
returned
on
a
motor
bicycle
at
eight
this
morning
these
facts
would
fit
in
with
the
supposition
that
he
was
at
giant
tor
point
at
dawn
what
we
want
you
to
do
is
to
watch
the
house
and
identify
him
if
he
comes
out
now
of
course
you
understand
that
it
would
do
for
a
young
lady
and
a
detective
to
sit
on
the
doorstep
waiting
for
him
at
the
first
sight
of
us
he
escape
by
the
back
way
we
want
to
catch
him
off
his
guard
my
idea
is
this
have
you
any
notion
of
gardening
a
little
said
lorraine
surprised
you
could
rake
about
at
any
rate
and
pull
up
a
few
weeds
well
there
a
small
public
park
right
in
front
of
the
house
in
spring
terrace
if
you
do
mind
putting
on
a
land
worker
costume
that
borrowed
for
you
we
employ
you
for
the
day
on
a
job
of
gardening
in
the
park
you
can
keep
one
eye
on
the
weeds
and
the
other
on
the
front
door
of
spring
terrace
i
shall
be
near
you
bedding
out
fuchsias
you
agree
to
take
on
the
job
then
may
i
ask
you
to
step
into
this
other
room
and
put
on
your
land
costume
there
no
time
to
be
lost
we
want
to
miss
the
fellow
i
a
man
selling
newspapers
and
watching
the
house
but
he
no
use
as
a
witness
this
was
indeed
an
excitement
lorraine
felt
thrills
as
she
hurried
into
the
corduroys
leggings
and
smock
that
had
been
placed
ready
for
her
they
were
an
indifferent
fit
but
in
the
circumstances
that
did
not
matter
the
hat
she
thought
decidedly
becoming
on
her
return
to
the
office
she
found
that
detective
scott
had
also
accomplished
a
quick
change
he
was
now
arrayed
in
a
shabby
suit
of
clothes
and
carried
a
parcel
of
plants
he
smiled
satisfaction
at
her
and
handed
her
a
rake
and
a
basket
good
luck
to
you
said
uncle
barton
i
shall
be
somewhere
about
in
the
park
not
far
from
you
but
i
better
not
show
up
too
much
these
fellows
soon
get
their
suspicions
aroused
if
they
see
people
hanging
round
it
was
certainly
a
new
experience
for
lorraine
to
walk
through
the
streets
of
cyr
in
smock
and
corduroys
but
the
townspeople
were
so
well
used
to
land
workers
that
nobody
took
any
particular
notice
of
her
the
park
was
close
at
hand
and
here
the
detective
setting
down
his
parcel
of
fuchsias
showed
her
a
patch
of
border
next
to
the
railings
and
instructed
her
to
weed
and
rake
it
no
is
the
house
with
the
green
blinds
and
the
plant
in
the
window
he
whispered
i
seen
jones
the
man
who
selling
newspapers
and
he
says
nobody
has
come
out
from
there
yet
answering
to
the
description
of
the
fellow
we
want
with
that
he
left
her
and
turning
his
back
began
operations
on
a
round
bed
already
fairly
full
of
lobelias
and
geraniums
lorraine
with
all
her
attention
concentrated
on
the
door
of
no
worked
abstractedly
she
thought
afterwards
that
if
any
of
the
ratepayers
of
cyr
had
taken
the
trouble
to
watch
her
gardening
operations
they
would
have
decided
that
girls
on
the
land
were
certainly
not
worth
their
salt
she
raked
and
weeded
and
picked
up
a
few
dead
twigs
and
scraped
some
moss
off
the
path
with
a
trowel
turning
her
head
every
other
moment
to
peep
through
the
railings
once
the
door
of
no
opened
and
she
held
her
breath
but
it
was
only
a
lady
who
came
out
with
a
little
child
was
this
mysterious
foreigner
really
in
the
house
he
might
have
escaped
by
a
back
way
or
have
gone
off
in
some
disguise
in
which
case
all
her
waiting
would
be
in
vain
hour
after
hour
passed
by
the
night
at
the
cove
and
the
agitation
of
the
early
morning
had
made
her
very
tired
but
she
stuck
grimly
to
her
job
she
was
hungry
too
for
it
was
nearly
three
and
she
had
eaten
nothing
since
breakfast
the
detective
who
had
been
pottering
about
the
sauntered
carelessly
up
to
her
as
if
to
direct
her
work
can
you
hold
out
any
longer
he
asked
under
his
breath
i
try
she
answered
pluckily
i
send
a
boy
to
buy
you
some
buns
i
expect
after
a
night
out
the
fellow
sleeping
there
no
knowing
what
time
he
may
choose
to
take
a
walk
the
only
thing
is
to
stick
it
as
long
as
you
can
the
buns
arrived
in
due
course
delivered
in
a
paper
bag
by
a
small
boy
lorraine
felt
a
little
better
after
eating
them
but
her
task
of
waiting
and
watching
had
grown
irksome
in
the
extreme
she
hated
that
patch
of
ground
behind
the
railings
she
felt
that
she
would
remember
the
look
of
the
brown
soil
for
the
rest
of
her
life
the
clock
chimed
the
quarters
the
distance
between
the
chimes
seemed
interminable
she
had
never
realised
that
fifteen
minutes
could
be
so
long
four
struck
then
the
time
dragged
on
till
then
a
quarter
to
five
i
believe
i
faint
or
do
something
silly
if
i
stay
here
much
longer
thought
lorraine
i
wish
my
legs
would
shake
in
such
an
idiotic
manner
five
sounded
from
the
tower
of
the
market
hall
she
stretched
her
weary
back
and
leaned
on
her
rake
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
door
opposite
it
was
opening
someone
was
standing
in
the
hall
and
apparently
speaking
he
slammed
the
door
and
came
down
the
path
towards
the
gate
there
was
no
mistaking
the
dark
face
she
knew
its
owner
again
instantly
at
the
gate
he
paused
and
lighted
a
cigarette
then
walked
rapidly
away
in
the
direction
of
the
railway
station
the
detective
turned
from
his
humming
a
tune
with
apparent
indifference
can
you
identify
him
he
whispered
certainly
i
can
without
a
doubt
it
the
man
i
saw
this
morning
we
just
catch
him
at
the
corner
of
the
park
then
i
a
couple
of
men
waiting
chuckled
the
detective
taking
a
short
cut
over
the
regardless
of
tender
seedlings
lorraine
was
not
near
enough
to
witness
the
actual
arrest
what
happened
next
was
that
barton
forrester
came
and
took
her
back
to
the
police
station
where
she
formally
identified
the
prisoner
then
she
thankfully
changed
into
her
own
clothes
and
went
with
uncle
barton
into
the
town
to
get
some
tea
little
uncle
barton
was
as
excited
and
pleased
as
a
boy
at
the
result
of
the
adventure
his
face
beamed
with
satisfaction
as
he
ordered
cakes
at
the
café
we
done
a
good
day
work
lorraine
he
confided
lowering
his
voice
lest
bystanders
should
overhear
that
fellow
has
been
under
suspicion
but
they
could
catch
him
tripping
dodson
the
detective
believes
he
turn
out
a
notorious
spy
in
which
case
they
have
plenty
of
witnesses
against
him
on
other
charges
without
needing
to
bring
you
into
the
matter
again
they
deal
with
him
under
martial
law
there
are
far
too
many
of
these
spies
about
the
country
half
of
the
foreigners
who
are
here
ought
to
be
interned
you
looked
in
that
his
eyes
twinkled
will
you
stick
to
your
job
as
in
the
park
not
for
worlds
exclaimed
lorraine
eloquently
helping
herself
to
a
second
cup
of
tea
chapter
xxi
trouble
when
lorraine
looked
back
upon
those
few
warm
days
in
july
she
decided
that
they
had
contained
more
concentrated
adventure
than
had
been
provided
in
the
whole
course
of
her
life
events
seemed
to
follow
quickly
one
upon
another
on
the
day
after
her
exciting
experience
at
cyr
she
went
to
school
as
usual
it
was
an
effort
to
do
so
for
she
was
tired
but
she
had
a
record
for
punctual
attendance
and
did
not
wish
to
break
it
unless
under
special
compulsion
to
her
surprise
claudia
was
absent
she
missed
her
chum
and
kept
looking
anxiously
towards
the
door
expecting
the
golden
head
to
pop
in
at
the
eleventh
hour
but
nine
and
the
came
and
no
sign
of
claudia
miss
turner
marked
her
absent
and
put
back
the
book
inside
the
desk
the
girls
took
out
their
copies
of
molière
in
preparation
for
the
french
lesson
miss
turner
collected
some
papers
from
her
desk
and
walked
away
to
instruct
the
third
form
on
the
subject
of
roman
history
the
sixth
sat
with
their
books
before
them
and
waited
under
ordinary
circumstances
madame
bertier
was
punctuality
personified
she
was
generally
in
the
schoolroom
before
miss
turner
made
her
exit
what
had
happened
to
her
at
twenty
minutes
past
nine
miss
janet
entered
looking
flurried
i
fear
madame
must
be
unwell
as
she
has
not
come
or
sent
a
note
she
explained
briefly
you
had
better
go
on
with
your
preparation
and
write
your
exercises
i
suppose
you
know
what
to
do
next
then
get
to
work
and
of
course
i
put
you
on
your
honour
as
seniors
to
keep
the
silence
rule
lorraine
sitting
scribbling
away
at
her
desk
felt
in
no
mood
to
break
the
rule
by
entering
into
conversation
with
either
dorothy
or
audrey
who
sat
respectively
to
right
and
left
of
her
her
thoughts
were
far
away
from
the
pen
which
was
automatically
writing
her
exercise
what
had
become
of
madame
bertier
was
her
absence
in
any
way
connected
with
the
events
of
yesterday
that
was
the
question
which
kept
forcing
itself
upon
her
brain
she
wondered
whether
miss
janet
had
ever
harboured
suspicions
of
the
attractive
russian
she
had
never
fallen
under
her
sway
so
completely
as
her
sister
had
done
something
in
miss
worried
expression
made
lorraine
think
her
surmise
a
correct
one
lorraine
french
grammar
went
to
the
winds
that
morning
and
she
wrote
down
mistakes
which
in
calmer
moments
would
have
caused
her
to
shudder
at
the
eleven
interval
claudia
walked
into
the
lorraine
who
had
come
for
her
packet
of
lunch
greeted
her
with
surprised
enthusiasm
here
you
are
at
last
why
are
you
so
late
i
simply
loads
to
tell
you
do
you
know
that
madame
bertier
never
turned
up
has
she
said
claudia
abstractedly
i
loads
to
tell
you
too
lorraine
come
into
the
garden
i
do
want
anyone
to
overhear
when
they
were
out
of
reach
of
the
ears
of
prying
juniors
claudia
continued
i
in
dreadful
trouble
that
why
i
so
late
everything
gone
wrong
yesterday
afternoon
i
had
a
telegram
from
morland
parcel
immediately
to
the
george
that
case
that
the
officer
lost
i
always
thought
morland
ought
to
have
given
it
back
to
him
at
once
well
did
you
go
to
the
cave
and
fetch
it
i
went
said
claudia
slowly
but
when
i
looked
in
the
little
cupboard
it
was
there
not
there
lorraine
tone
was
no
i
hunted
all
round
the
cave
but
it
had
gone
absolutely
great
scott
what
are
we
to
do
i
do
know
i
telegraphed
to
morland
that
it
was
lost
i
hope
he
wo
get
into
trouble
about
it
i
hope
not
lorraine
face
was
very
grave
and
to
make
things
worse
landry
is
ill
in
bed
he
in
one
of
his
most
fractious
moods
and
wo
have
anybody
near
him
but
me
i
only
ran
down
to
school
for
a
few
minutes
to
tell
you
that
the
dispatch
case
is
lost
then
i
must
go
back
to
him
i
explained
to
miss
janet
that
he
ill
and
i
have
to
nurse
him
there
the
bell
and
you
must
go
in
what
a
nuisance
come
and
see
me
after
four
if
you
can
i
try
till
then
claudia
and
lorraine
hurried
in
opposite
directions
the
one
home
and
the
other
into
school
lorraine
was
in
a
ferment
of
emotion
who
could
possibly
have
taken
the
pocket
case
some
intruder
must
have
discovered
their
cave
and
have
stolen
it
from
the
cupboard
was
it
some
chance
tourist
who
had
climbed
up
the
rocks
or
was
it
could
it
be
madame
bertier
lorraine
had
always
suspected
that
morland
had
told
her
the
secret
of
the
grotto
what
if
she
had
gone
there
found
the
officer
private
papers
and
made
treasonable
use
of
them
there
were
so
many
doubtful
episodes
in
connection
with
her
the
cut
telephone
wire
her
meeting
on
the
shore
with
the
man
arrested
only
yesterday
as
a
spy
who
had
claimed
her
portrait
at
the
academy
as
that
of
his
wife
it
looks
bad
thought
lorraine
oh
why
did
we
persuade
morland
to
give
that
wretched
case
back
at
once
to
his
captain
what
will
he
do
when
he
gets
claudia
telegram
the
answer
to
this
question
came
later
on
in
the
day
she
was
walking
back
to
school
at
a
quarter
past
two
that
afternoon
when
just
by
the
windmill
she
met
morland
himself
on
a
motor
bicycle
he
dismounted
at
once
lorraine
the
very
person
in
all
the
world
i
want
to
see
i
say
going
to
ask
to
leave
the
bike
at
the
windmill
here
then
will
you
walk
up
the
hill
with
me
it
nearly
school
time
demurred
lorraine
hang
school
for
once
i
tell
you
i
talk
to
you
i
in
the
most
awful
mess
i
ever
got
into
in
my
life
is
it
true
what
claudia
telegraphed
is
that
pocket
book
really
gone
from
the
grotto
he
spoke
rapidly
catching
his
breath
lorraine
felt
that
as
in
the
case
of
yesterday
school
must
yield
to
weightier
matters
she
could
not
desert
morland
now
for
the
sake
of
a
botany
class
his
business
was
urgent
leave
your
bike
then
and
i
come
she
consented
so
they
walked
up
the
hill
together
towards
windy
howe
and
he
poured
out
his
story
it
seems
there
were
most
important
papers
in
that
pocket
case
he
confided
the
captain
kicked
up
an
awful
shindy
at
losing
them
inquired
and
advertised
and
put
it
into
the
hands
of
the
police
at
first
i
was
like
brer
rabbit
i
just
low
and
said
nuffin
and
chuckled
to
think
i
was
leading
him
such
a
dance
then
one
of
the
chaps
told
me
he
heard
that
a
at
porthkeverne
had
seen
a
tommy
picking
something
up
on
the
road
i
can
tell
you
that
made
me
sit
up
i
forgotten
we
were
close
to
that
wretched
station
i
twigged
in
a
flash
that
i
was
in
the
greatest
danger
of
discovery
blake
would
remember
passing
me
on
the
moor
i
stood
aside
and
saluted
there
was
no
other
tommy
near
lorraine
if
they
fix
this
on
to
me
i
shall
be
i
tell
you
i
simply
ca
face
it
it
seemed
indeed
the
most
desperate
problem
with
which
they
had
ever
dealt
unless
the
case
were
found
ruin
stared
morland
in
the
face
captain
blake
strictest
of
martinets
would
not
be
likely
to
overlook
so
grave
an
offence
how
did
you
manage
to
come
over
here
asked
lorraine
pitched
it
strong
about
urgent
business
and
got
a
few
extra
hours
off
borrowed
a
and
pelted
here
for
all
i
was
worth
i
felt
i
did
care
whether
i
broke
my
neck
or
not
oh
morland
well
i
tell
you
i
did
i
rode
part
of
the
way
at
sixty
miles
an
hour
and
i
whizzed
down
that
long
hill
to
cyr
simply
like
a
hurricane
look
here
i
do
want
to
show
up
at
home
for
fear
dad
or
violet
ask
questions
what
to
be
done
wait
at
the
bottom
of
the
orchard
and
i
run
up
to
the
house
and
fetch
claudia
she
at
home
nursing
landry
who
in
bed
you
mascot
the
very
thing
leaving
morland
sitting
under
the
elder
bushes
by
the
orchard
gate
lorraine
made
her
way
into
the
garden
and
finding
one
of
the
numerous
little
castletons
playing
about
despatched
her
with
a
message
to
claudia
the
latter
came
out
at
once
lorraine
explained
hurriedly
and
the
two
girls
with
some
difficulty
evading
the
curiosity
of
beata
romola
and
madox
whisked
down
a
side
path
into
the
orchard
and
joined
morland
they
held
a
very
agitated
council
of
three
under
the
elder
bushes
are
you
the
case
is
there
urged
morland
absolutely
i
hunted
for
half
an
hour
round
the
cave
declared
claudia
then
who
taken
it
if
it
some
chance
tourist
who
got
it
it
may
be
returned
lorraine
shook
her
head
i
terribly
afraid
it
madame
bertier
i
believe
she
mixed
up
in
a
very
queer
piece
of
business
here
i
want
to
tell
you
what
happened
yesterday
as
lorraine
recounted
her
adventures
at
cyr
and
the
connection
of
the
foreigner
whom
she
had
helped
to
identify
with
the
fascinating
russian
morland
face
darkened
great
heavens
was
the
woman
a
spy
after
all
he
groaned
it
the
limit
what
an
infernal
ass
i
been
if
she
caught
with
those
papers
on
her
and
they
traced
to
me
i
done
for
once
and
for
all
look
here
i
going
out
to
the
cave
to
have
one
last
hunt
for
the
case
it
might
have
slipped
behind
something
will
you
girls
come
with
me
what
the
use
i
know
we
sha
find
it
said
claudia
besides
i
ca
leave
landry
he
in
bed
and
very
troublesome
he
talks
rubbish
the
whole
time
mostly
about
you
morland
he
keeps
suddenly
laughing
and
saying
he
stopped
your
going
to
the
war
and
is
it
clever
of
him
but
he
gets
angry
if
i
ask
how
and
shouts
out
that
it
his
secret
and
he
wo
tell
me
violet
fed
up
with
him
i
left
her
in
his
room
but
if
i
not
quick
back
she
be
sending
one
of
the
children
to
hunt
for
me
morland
rose
hurriedly
i
best
scoot
before
the
kids
find
me
out
lorraine
will
you
come
it
seemed
cruel
to
desert
the
poor
boy
at
such
a
pinch
so
lorraine
consented
but
by
the
time
they
had
walked
down
the
steep
lane
to
pettington
church
she
changed
her
mind
at
the
lychgate
she
stopped
i
so
tired
morland
i
do
think
i
trudge
all
that
way
to
tangy
point
time
important
and
you
walk
so
much
faster
without
me
you
hurry
on
and
i
wait
for
you
here
right
oh
i
a
selfish
beast
to
ask
you
to
go
old
girl
if
i
do
find
that
case
perhaps
you
never
see
me
again
morland
morland
called
lorraine
but
his
figure
was
already
tearing
along
the
steep
track
up
the
cliff
and
he
did
not
look
round
in
another
moment
he
had
vanished
behind
a
turn
of
the
rocks
lorraine
sank
down
on
the
seat
inside
the
lychgate
she
felt
mean
at
not
walking
with
him
but
the
afternoon
was
sultry
and
hot
and
she
was
very
tired
after
her
yesterday
adventures
she
knew
that
he
had
gone
on
a
fruitless
errand
and
that
though
it
might
satisfy
him
to
look
on
his
own
account
he
would
certainly
not
find
the
missing
inside
the
cave
oh
why
did
i
make
a
stand
at
the
time
and
insist
on
his
giving
it
back
to
captain
blake
at
once
she
fretted
i
wish
i
more
strength
of
mind
i
was
a
weak
he
have
done
it
if
i
held
out
more
what
going
to
happen
now
goodness
only
knows
when
he
sees
that
the
case
really
is
there
i
afraid
he
do
something
really
desperate
run
away
or
jump
into
the
sea
or
anything
it
the
worst
fix
i
ever
been
in
in
all
my
life
could
i
take
the
blame
on
myself
it
was
as
much
my
fault
as
his
i
certainly
what
would
be
called
an
accomplice
i
wish
i
could
ask
detective
scott
about
it
but
i
dare
morland
might
be
arrested
like
that
spy
oh
it
too
horrible
to
think
he
may
be
will
they
put
him
in
prison
shoot
him
even
lorraine
notions
of
military
discipline
were
hazy
but
she
knew
that
the
keeping
back
of
important
papers
was
an
offence
of
the
utmost
seriousness
and
that
if
they
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
a
spy
it
might
mean
a
charge
of
treason
wild
visions
of
saving
morland
at
any
cost
floated
through
her
mind
she
felt
almost
prepared
to
give
herself
up
to
the
police
and
make
a
confession
yet
how
could
she
do
so
without
involving
her
friends
she
would
certainly
be
asked
if
she
had
picked
up
the
case
herself
and
why
she
had
not
returned
it
immediately
to
its
owner
what
would
she
answer
they
have
it
all
out
of
me
in
five
minutes
when
they
began
and
i
should
only
land
morland
in
a
worse
mess
than
ever
she
decided
gloomily
could
uncle
barton
help
i
wonder
no
as
a
special
constable
he
be
bound
to
give
information
he
no
more
use
than
detective
scott
lorraine
sighed
and
moved
farther
along
the
seat
into
the
shade
it
was
a
broiling
afternoon
the
sun
was
pouring
down
on
the
grey
tower
of
the
little
church
and
on
the
mildewed
grave
stones
and
the
bushes
of
rosemary
and
lavender
and
the
box
edging
that
led
to
the
norman
doorway
a
rambler
rose
rioted
over
the
railings
of
a
monument
its
crimson
trusses
of
blossom
veiled
the
broken
urn
inside
over
the
wall
the
green
stood
out
against
the
gleaming
sea
bees
were
humming
under
the
archway
of
the
roof
some
swallows
scintillated
by
with
gleaming
wings
not
a
soul
was
near
she
was
alone
with
the
sunshine
and
the
birds
and
the
flowers
there
flashed
across
her
a
strong
memory
of
the
day
when
she
and
claudia
and
morland
had
taken
their
first
walk
to
the
cave
and
had
stopped
to
look
at
the
church
the
forsaken
merman
church
as
claudia
always
called
it
how
happy
they
had
been
then
with
no
terrible
shadow
hanging
over
them
she
could
almost
hear
claudia
voice
quoting
the
poem
from
the
church
came
a
murmur
of
folk
at
their
prayers
but
we
stood
without
in
the
cold
blowing
airs
it
was
just
the
opposite
now
for
she
sat
without
in
the
heat
and
there
was
nobody
inside
saying
prayers
the
door
stood
open
not
shut
something
urged
her
to
enter
some
impulse
so
strong
and
so
overpowering
that
instinctively
she
rose
and
walked
up
the
little
path
between
the
lines
of
box
edging
it
was
almost
as
if
an
invisible
hand
led
her
on
under
the
groined
porch
and
through
the
carved
norman
doorway
how
cool
and
peaceful
it
was
inside
in
the
soft
diffused
golden
light
falling
on
the
sandstone
pillars
through
the
windows
though
no
service
was
in
progress
she
had
a
sense
that
the
prayers
of
many
generations
lingered
in
the
place
and
made
it
holy
the
haloed
saints
in
the
east
window
smiled
down
at
her
with
calm
eyes
had
they
ever
been
in
trouble
as
she
was
in
their
white
robes
and
with
palms
in
their
hands
they
looked
so
infinitely
removed
from
the
twentieth
century
yet
their
own
times
must
have
seemed
absolutely
modern
to
them
there
was
nothing
in
their
lives
which
could
not
be
also
in
ours
the
same
who
gave
them
that
perfect
peace
could
give
it
surely
to
us
in
the
dim
shadow
of
the
chancel
she
dropped
on
her
knees
and
prayed
not
a
stilted
formal
prayer
but
a
sort
of
intense
wordless
passion
of
entreaty
for
that
boy
whose
life
was
going
so
wrong
as
she
rose
to
her
feet
again
her
eyes
fell
on
the
carved
oak
balustrade
of
the
gallery
at
the
west
end
it
was
the
place
where
landry
had
been
wont
to
sit
and
listen
when
morland
played
the
organ
she
could
almost
see
him
now
with
his
parted
lips
and
blue
eyes
and
the
sunlight
from
the
window
behind
making
a
halo
of
his
hair
she
wondered
how
the
church
looked
from
his
vantage
point
she
had
never
been
into
the
gallery
she
walked
slowly
down
the
nave
and
up
the
dusty
flight
of
stairs
into
the
cobwebby
regions
above
there
was
a
low
bench
facing
the
balustrade
she
moved
along
it
and
sat
down
in
landry
seat
there
was
no
dreamy
haunting
music
from
the
organ
filling
the
church
like
the
murmur
of
the
sea
morland
had
sterner
work
to
do
in
the
world
now
than
to
improvise
nocturnes
how
rapt
his
face
had
been
as
the
grand
harmonies
came
thrilling
from
his
fingers
was
this
the
exact
angle
from
which
landry
had
viewed
him
she
moved
slightly
farther
along
and
in
doing
so
kicked
some
object
with
her
foot
she
stooped
to
pick
it
up
it
was
something
quite
small
and
covered
with
dust
she
held
it
up
to
look
at
it
by
the
light
from
the
window
then
with
a
little
gasping
sob
she
fell
back
on
to
the
seat
it
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
the
lost
landry
they
had
never
thought
of
landry
he
had
been
with
them
in
the
cave
when
they
hid
it
inside
the
cupboard
lorraine
remembered
now
how
he
had
made
confused
reference
to
papers
and
morland
going
to
the
war
and
how
claudia
had
soothed
him
and
told
him
to
pick
shells
on
the
beach
without
doubt
he
must
have
taken
the
case
with
some
dazed
belief
that
by
so
doing
he
was
hindering
the
authorities
from
sending
his
brother
to
the
front
perhaps
that
was
the
mysterious
secret
he
was
babbling
about
in
bed
the
case
might
have
lain
for
months
in
the
dust
if
lorraine
had
not
chanced
to
come
into
the
gallery
this
afternoon
chanced
there
was
no
such
thing
as
chance
surely
it
was
the
answer
to
that
intense
voiceless
of
prayer
in
which
her
groping
spirit
had
for
a
moment
soared
into
a
higher
plane
and
touched
the
fringes
of
the
eternal
world
morland
was
saved
saved
from
the
shadow
of
a
terrible
disgrace
she
must
let
him
know
at
once
for
by
this
time
he
must
have
reached
the
cave
and
ransacked
it
in
vain
suppose
in
his
despair
he
were
to
carry
out
his
threat
and
never
return
the
horror
of
the
thought
sent
lorraine
tearing
down
the
gallery
steps
and
out
into
the
sunshine
she
must
follow
morland
and
find
him
and
tell
him
she
was
rested
now
and
the
walk
would
seem
nothing
besides
it
was
cooler
and
a
breeze
had
sprung
up
from
the
sea
when
the
heart
is
light
our
feet
seem
literally
to
dance
along
the
distance
to
tangy
point
seemed
halved
she
climbed
down
the
steep
little
track
from
the
cairn
on
to
the
shore
seated
on
a
rock
below
the
cave
was
a
figure
in
khaki
morland
did
not
stir
till
she
came
near
then
he
rose
with
a
haggard
face
and
wild
eyes
lorraine
it
all
u
p
with
me
he
said
breathlessly
but
for
answer
she
waved
the
they
decided
on
the
way
home
that
the
safest
and
wisest
plan
was
to
make
it
into
a
parcel
address
it
to
captain
blake
at
the
camp
and
post
it
to
him
from
porthkeverne
he
would
receive
it
the
next
morning
and
would
probably
be
satisfied
and
make
no
more
enquiries
as
to
who
had
found
it
and
forwarded
it
so
it
was
madame
bertier
who
took
it
after
all
commented
lorraine
no
said
morland
thoughtfully
but
i
believe
she
would
have
done
it
if
she
had
the
chance
i
had
my
eyes
opened
i
been
a
fool
lorraine
i
going
to
start
a
fresh
page
and
try
to
be
worthy
of
my
best
friends
i
simply
ca
express
what
i
owe
you
you
the
sort
of
girl
that
keeps
a
fellow
straight
some
women
send
them
on
the
rocks
when
i
think
of
you
i
think
of
everything
that
is
true
and
good
i
not
much
to
boast
of
i
afraid
said
lorraine
humbly
but
trying
trying
hard
like
many
other
people
who
are
a
great
deal
better
and
nicer
and
sweeter
tempered
than
i
am
chapter
xxii
the
parting
of
the
ways
events
most
fortunately
turned
out
as
lorraine
and
morland
had
hoped
captain
blake
received
an
anonymous
parcel
containing
his
lost
and
judging
probably
that
some
chance
had
picked
it
up
and
tardily
restored
it
made
no
further
stir
in
the
matter
so
the
cloud
which
had
threatened
to
break
in
an
overwhelming
storm
of
ruin
blew
safely
over
and
left
clear
skies
behind
lorraine
returned
to
the
gables
next
morning
to
find
the
school
in
a
whirl
of
excitement
over
the
disappearance
of
madame
bertier
she
had
been
missing
from
her
lodgings
since
the
very
morning
when
the
took
in
its
cargo
of
oil
from
smugglers
cove
she
had
departed
no
one
knew
whither
without
even
a
portmanteau
or
a
handbag
and
had
left
absolutely
no
trace
of
her
destination
the
police
came
and
examined
her
belongings
but
they
found
nothing
treasonable
though
a
heap
of
white
ashes
in
the
showed
that
papers
must
have
been
burnt
the
fascinating
russian
adventuress
vanished
from
the
world
of
porthkeverne
as
suddenly
and
mysteriously
as
she
had
appeared
there
her
exit
made
a
wonder
in
the
artistic
and
literary
circles
where
her
clever
personality
had
won
her
so
much
favour
wiseacres
shook
their
heads
and
remembered
suspicious
circumstances
which
had
not
struck
them
at
the
time
as
incriminating
at
the
gables
miss
kingsley
hastily
reorganized
her
teaching
staff
handing
the
french
classes
over
to
miss
paget
and
the
music
to
miss
turner
until
the
end
of
the
term
she
felt
the
blow
to
be
a
double
one
for
not
only
did
it
seriously
upset
the
arrangements
of
the
school
but
it
wounded
her
in
a
tender
spot
she
had
been
very
kind
to
madame
bertier
and
had
thought
that
in
befriending
and
giving
her
employment
she
was
aiding
a
distressed
ally
to
gain
an
honourable
living
to
her
upright
and
patriotic
temperament
the
disillusionment
was
painful
there
was
little
of
the
term
left
now
in
a
few
weeks
the
holidays
would
be
here
and
the
group
of
girls
who
were
working
together
in
the
sixth
form
would
be
dispersed
lorraine
could
hardly
realize
that
her
school
days
were
so
nearly
ended
she
had
been
happy
at
the
gables
and
she
was
sorry
to
leave
yet
life
stretched
before
her
very
bright
and
fair
with
such
pleasant
prospects
that
she
thrilled
when
she
thought
of
the
future
her
father
had
decided
that
her
artistic
talent
was
quite
sufficient
to
justify
him
in
sending
her
to
london
to
study
art
and
had
consulted
margaret
lindsay
as
to
the
best
master
under
whom
to
place
her
lorraine
in
her
saturday
mornings
lessons
had
dabbled
in
a
variety
of
arts
and
crafts
and
had
tried
her
hand
at
water
colours
oil
painting
illustrating
gesso
metal
work
wood
engraving
and
enamelling
each
she
knew
was
a
separate
career
in
itself
that
would
take
many
years
in
which
to
gain
even
a
mediocre
proficiency
on
the
whole
her
inclination
led
her
to
take
up
sculpture
she
had
been
most
successful
with
clay
modelling
and
several
porthkeverne
artists
who
had
seen
some
of
her
work
had
praised
it
and
advised
her
to
go
on
down
at
the
dear
studio
by
the
harbour
where
her
first
artistic
inspirations
had
been
received
she
talked
the
matter
over
with
her
friend
margaret
was
packing
to
go
away
and
the
room
was
strewn
with
canvases
boards
paints
and
other
impedimenta
lorraine
sitting
on
the
table
flourishing
a
aired
her
views
it
so
glorious
to
take
up
something
that
you
feel
perhaps
some
day
you
may
if
you
work
hard
be
able
to
make
something
of
carina
if
i
ever
get
anything
into
an
exhibition
i
shall
just
want
to
turn
head
over
heels
with
joy
art
suits
me
far
better
than
music
if
you
go
in
for
playing
or
singing
you
have
to
perform
before
an
audience
and
the
feeling
that
anybody
is
listening
to
me
simply
me
you
know
what
agonies
i
go
through
when
i
asked
to
play
my
violin
before
visitors
i
so
nervous
that
my
fingers
absolutely
dither
now
painting
or
sculpture
you
can
do
when
you
quite
alone
and
when
finished
people
can
look
at
it
and
you
need
even
be
there
to
show
it
off
do
you
sympathise
indeed
i
do
for
anybody
afflicted
with
shyness
a
studio
is
certainly
preferable
to
a
platform
and
works
of
art
if
they
are
worth
anything
live
on
you
ought
to
do
well
lorraine
if
you
work
you
the
sculptor
thumb
broad
and
thin
and
turned
back
i
glad
you
to
study
under
davidson
he
an
inspiring
teacher
and
very
thorough
i
shall
leave
the
music
to
monica
decided
lorraine
she
a
monkey
sometimes
but
she
a
clever
little
mortal
much
cleverer
than
i
am
i
sometimes
think
she
be
the
success
of
the
family
all
of
the
sixth
form
at
the
gables
were
going
their
several
ways
patsie
contemplated
work
on
the
land
vivien
meant
to
devote
herself
to
the
red
cross
dorothy
was
destined
for
college
nellie
to
study
kindergarten
training
for
claudia
the
future
was
still
nebulous
under
rosemary
instruction
she
had
practised
her
singing
with
an
immense
enthusiasm
her
voice
was
developing
wonderfully
rosemary
listened
to
it
with
somewhat
the
feeling
of
an
artist
who
has
created
a
most
beautiful
thing
she
had
taught
claudia
to
accomplish
what
she
could
never
compass
herself
her
own
talent
passed
on
to
another
had
gained
ten
talents
more
at
the
end
of
july
before
the
college
of
music
closed
its
summer
session
rosemary
wrote
to
signor
arezzo
concerning
her
pupil
and
received
a
reply
making
an
appointment
for
her
to
bring
claudia
to
have
her
voice
tested
this
was
tremendous
news
she
went
up
to
windy
howe
with
the
letter
castleton
absorbed
in
a
classic
painting
of
beata
and
romola
as
wood
nymphs
detached
his
mind
with
difficulty
from
greek
draperies
and
focused
it
upon
his
eldest
daughter
i
did
not
know
claudia
could
sing
he
remarked
with
surprise
why
my
dear
she
always
singing
about
the
house
and
has
a
very
good
voice
too
it
would
be
splendid
if
she
could
make
something
of
it
put
in
his
wife
who
in
this
case
proved
her
firm
ally
be
generous
now
and
let
the
girl
run
up
to
town
with
miss
forrester
who
knows
what
may
come
of
it
castleton
was
mixing
a
subtle
shade
of
grey
for
the
folds
beneath
romola
girdle
at
the
moment
he
would
have
consented
to
anything
to
get
rid
of
visitors
and
go
on
with
his
painting
let
her
go
if
she
likes
he
agreed
so
the
appointment
was
accepted
and
one
day
in
the
next
week
an
anxious
little
rosemary
living
in
a
whirl
of
hopes
piloted
a
nervous
blushing
but
quite
too
lovely
claudia
into
the
solemn
precincts
of
the
college
of
music
signor
arezzo
had
in
his
time
trained
hundreds
of
musical
students
most
of
them
possessed
moderate
talents
some
were
clever
and
an
elect
few
passed
on
to
the
concert
platform
it
was
only
once
or
twice
in
his
teaching
career
that
he
had
discovered
a
voice
worthy
of
grand
opera
his
experienced
eye
measured
claudia
with
satisfaction
her
beautiful
throat
was
certainly
that
of
a
singer
on
the
operatic
stage
that
face
and
figure
would
be
worth
a
fortune
he
did
not
commit
himself
however
but
asking
her
to
come
nearer
to
the
piano
played
a
few
chords
and
began
to
test
her
voice
at
first
claudia
was
nervous
but
after
she
had
sung
some
exercises
the
feeling
passed
and
she
poured
out
her
notes
as
naturally
as
she
had
done
in
the
orchard
at
home
the
professor
made
her
try
various
scales
arpeggios
studies
and
a
song
thank
you
he
said
at
last
that
will
do
i
can
safely
promise
you
a
scholarship
at
the
college
next
september
if
you
ready
to
work
i
think
we
may
make
something
of
you
now
will
you
go
into
the
and
wait
while
i
speak
to
miss
forrester
i
want
to
have
a
word
with
her
when
claudia
with
shining
eyes
had
gone
out
of
the
room
signor
arezzo
turned
to
rosemary
and
shook
her
warmly
by
the
hand
i
congratulate
you
he
said
unless
i
much
mistaken
discovered
an
operatic
star
the
girl
has
a
most
marvellous
voice
she
be
a
credit
to
the
college
some
day
and
she
has
every
element
for
a
successful
graceful
movement
enthusiasm
and
dramatic
fire
you
say
you
have
only
been
training
her
since
last
may
why
it
marvellous
you
must
be
a
born
teacher
i
could
have
done
more
with
her
in
the
time
myself
if
you
would
care
to
help
me
with
some
of
my
pupils
you
could
take
a
good
deal
of
work
off
my
hands
i
have
never
found
anyone
before
who
so
absolutely
realised
my
methods
i
should
be
very
glad
to
give
you
charge
of
the
beginners
under
my
supervision
it
was
rosemary
turn
now
to
be
surprised
oh
if
i
only
might
she
gasped
two
very
delighted
and
happy
girls
returned
to
porthkeverne
next
day
claudia
with
the
sure
prospect
of
a
scholarship
and
rosemary
almost
dazed
at
the
offer
of
so
splendid
a
post
as
assistant
to
signor
arezzo
is
it
wonderful
muvvie
she
confided
just
when
i
was
wailing
that
my
life
was
spoilt
i
found
my
true
career
i
see
now
that
i
should
never
have
been
a
success
on
a
platform
and
i
glad
signor
arezzo
had
the
honesty
to
tell
me
so
but
teaching
is
quite
different
i
can
feel
how
things
ought
to
be
and
i
can
make
other
people
do
them
it
like
working
on
their
instruments
instead
of
mine
think
of
going
back
to
the
dear
old
college
and
actually
having
an
established
place
there
i
do
hope
i
shall
really
be
as
useful
to
the
professor
as
he
seems
to
expect
with
lorraine
studying
sculpture
and
claudia
and
myself
at
the
college
what
a
gorgeous
time
we
shall
all
have
at
the
hostel
together
the
final
day
of
the
term
at
the
gables
had
arrived
and
the
girls
in
their
best
dresses
were
ready
to
assemble
in
the
gymnasium
for
the
which
always
celebrated
the
close
of
the
school
year
the
monitresses
met
in
the
sixth
form
room
for
the
last
time
they
took
their
parting
differently
according
to
temperament
audrey
was
sentimental
nellie
a
trifle
tearful
each
was
ready
to
expatiate
on
her
plans
for
the
future
in
three
weeks
i
hope
to
be
on
the
land
and
driving
a
with
a
piebald
pony
said
patsie
cheerfully
but
why
a
piebald
pony
asked
dorothy
in
a
puzzled
tone
why
because
people
are
so
superstitious
about
them
and
it
would
be
such
sport
to
come
careering
down
the
street
and
see
folks
suddenly
bending
to
touch
their
shoes
and
know
they
were
all
having
wishes
feel
like
a
fairy
godmother
or
father
christmas
i
got
my
land
costume
and
it
no
end
i
wanted
to
turn
up
in
it
to
show
you
all
only
mother
would
let
me
violet
sewing
very
hard
making
clothes
for
me
to
take
to
london
vouchsafed
claudia
she
been
a
perfect
trump
lately
beata
and
romola
are
to
start
school
here
in
september
they
fearfully
excited
and
little
monica
will
be
in
the
fourth
form
said
lorraine
i
wonder
who
will
be
monitresses
in
our
place
and
whom
miss
kingsley
will
choose
for
head
girl
whoever
your
successor
may
be
she
wo
make
a
better
head
girl
than
you
lorraine
said
patsie
heartily
we
have
said
much
but
appreciated
you
all
the
year
you
been
a
sport
i
why
i
done
nothing
for
the
school
i
afraid
not
nearly
as
much
as
i
wanted
to
do
we
did
want
a
paragon
returned
patsie
you
been
yourself
and
that
was
quite
good
enough
on
the
whole
it
been
a
ripping
year
there
is
very
little
more
to
tell
how
rosemary
and
lorraine
and
claudia
prospered
at
their
work
in
london
how
margaret
lindsay
took
a
studio
in
town
for
the
winter
and
joined
them
at
their
hostel
how
morland
went
to
the
front
did
a
splendid
unselfish
deed
and
won
the
are
all
beyond
the
limits
of
a
school
story
and
in
the
borderland
of
the
bigger
world
of
life
but
when
lorraine
in
days
to
come
looks
back
upon
the
old
fun
at
porthkeverne
i
think
she
will
emphatically
decide
that
whatever
happiness
or
success
she
may
win
afterwards
she
never
spent
a
jollier
livelier
more
and
altogether
satisfactory
time
than
the
year
she

girl
