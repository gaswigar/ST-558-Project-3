i
sure
you
often
been
misled
you
tried
a
to
secure
and
picked
a
hen
instead
you
wondered
what
the
lay
and
why
the
chestnut
burred
and
if
the
hops
away
it
perfectly
absurd
i
hence
submit
for
your
inspection
this
very
new
and
choice
collection
of
flowers
on
storks
and
phlox
of
birds
with
some
explanatory
words
not
every
one
is
always
able
to
recognize
a
vegetable
for
some
are
guided
by
tradition
while
others
use
their
intuition
and
even
i
make
no
pretense
of
having
more
than
common
sense
indeed
these
strange
homologies
are
in
most
flornithologies
and
i
have
freely
drawn
upon
the
works
of
gray
and
audubon
avoiding
though
the
frequent
blunders
of
those
who
study
nature
wonders

burr
bird

burr
bird
who
there
who
has
never
heard
about
the
burdock
and
the
bird
and
yet
how
very
very
few
discriminate
between
the
two
while
even
burbank
ca
transform
a
bird
into
a
plant

burbank
the
crow
the
crocus
illustration
the
crow
the
crocus
some
are
unable
as
you
know
to
tell
the
crocus
from
the
crow
the
reason
why
is
just
they
are
not
versed
in
nature
laws
the
noisy
cawing
crows
all
come
obedient
to
the
a
large
crow
to
convoke
you
never
hear
the
crocus
croak
the
clover
the
plover
illustration
the
clover
the
plover
the
plover
and
the
clover
can
be
told
apart
with
ease
by
paying
close
attention
to
the
habits
of
the
bees
for
aver
the
bee
can
be
in
clover
while
concur
there
is
no
b
in
plover
the
ole
gander
the
oleander
illustration
the
ole
gander
the
oleander
the
gander
loves
to
promenade
around
the
farmer
poultry
yard
while
as
we
see
the
oleander
is
quite
unable
to
meander
the
gardener
tied
it
up
indeed
fearing
that
it
might
run
to
seed
the
hen
the
lichen
illustration
the
hen
the
lichen
lichens
regardless
of
conventions
exist
in
only
two
dimensions
a
life
restricted
to
a
plane
on
rocks
and
stones
a
greenish
stain
they
live
upon
the
simplest
fare
a
drop
of
dew
a
breath
of
air
contrast
them
with
the
greedy
hen
and
her
most
careless
regimen
she
shuns
the
barren
stones
and
rocks
and
thrives
upon
the
garbage
box
the
pelican
the
panicle
illustration
the
pelican
the
panicle
the
panicle
and
pelican
have
often
been
confused
the
letters
which
spell
pelican
in
panicle
are
used
if
you
recognize
this
anagram
you
never
go
astray
or
make
the
careless
blunder
that
was
made
by
gray
the
pea
the
pewee
illustration
the
pea
the
pewee
to
tell
the
pewee
from
the
pea
requires
great
here
in
the
pod
we
see
the
pea
while
perched
close
by
is
the
pewee
the
pea
he
hears
the
pewee
peep
while
pewee
sees
the
wee
pea
weep
there
be
but
little
time
to
see
how
pewee
differs
from
the
pea
the
parrot
the
carrot
illustration
the
parrot
the
carrot
the
parrot
and
the
carrot
one
may
easily
confound
they
very
much
alike
in
looks
and
similar
in
sound
we
recognize
the
parrot
by
his
clear
articulation
for
carrots
are
unable
to
engage
in
conversation
the
rue
the
rooster
illustration
the
rue
the
rooster
when
you
awake
at
and
hear
a
no
argument
need
then
ensue
it
is
the
rooster
not
the
rue
which
never
thus
disturbs
our
dreams
with
ruthless
rude
nocturnal
screams
we
sleep
less
soundly
than
we
used
ter
and
love
the
rue
but
rue
the
rooster
the
hawk
the
hollyhock
illustration
the
hawk
the
hollyhock
to
recognize
this
the
broody
hen
you
should
survey
she
takes
her
chicks
on
daily
walks
among
the
neighboring
hollyhocks
while
with
the
hawk
association
is
quite
beyond
her
toleration
the
pecan
the
toucan
illustration
the
pecan
the
toucan
very
few
can
tell
the
toucan
from
the
pecan
here
a
new
plan
to
take
the
toucan
from
the
tree
requires
while
anyone
can
pick
with
ease
the
pecans
from
the
pecan
trees
it
such
an
easy
thing
to
do
that
even
the
toucan
he
can
too
the
the
illustration
the
the
the
call
resembles
that
emitted
by
the
pussy
cat
while
growing
by
the
wall
is
never
known
to
caterwaul
it
odor
though
attracts
the
kits
and
throws
them
in
fits

the
quail
the
kale
illustration
the
quail
the
kale
the
california
quail
is
said
to
have
a
tail
upon
his
head
while
we
style
the
kale
a
upon
a
tail
it
is
not
hard
to
tell
the
two
the
quail
commences
with
a
queue
the
auk
the
orchid
illustration
the
auk
the
orchid
we
seldom
meet
when
out
to
walk
either
the
orchid
or
the
auk
the
auk
is
only
known
to
dwellers
in
the
zone
while
orchids
can
be
found
in
legions
within
the
equatorial
regions
so
if
by
chance
you
travel
on
the
lena
or
the
be
certain
of
the

you
will
make
mistakes
i
sure

although
the
on
this
plant
suggest
perhaps
a
one
never
sees
the
opening
bud
devour
the
grass
or
chew
its
cud
the
cowbird
picture
i
suspect
is
absolutely
incorrect
we
make
such
errors
now
and
then
a
sort
of
cow
slip
of
the
pen

the
the

sing
from
morn

like
anything
the
quacking
of
the

not
be
called
a
song
at
all

thus
the
flower
may
learn
to
know
its
song
is
reproduced
below

the
roc
the
shamrock
illustration
the
roc
the
shamrock
although
i
never
took
much
stock
in
sinbad
yarn
about
the
roc
and
really
must
confess
i
am
inclined
to
think
the
roc
a
sham
take
notice
that
the
may
be
seen
upon

a
sparrer
asparagus
illustration
a
sparrer
asparagus
of
the
fall
of
the
sparrow
we
often
have
heard
and
i
here
represented
the
fall
of
the
bird
in
the
case
of
asparagus
though
i
may
mention
a
fall
such
as
this
is
quite
out
of
the
question
for
observe
that
asparagus
fat
and
well
fed
spends
all
of
his
time
in
the
bed

the
insects
to
avoid
surprise
by
birds
sometimes
themselves
disguise
as
leaves
and
twigs
and
thus
escape
the
appetizing
insect
fate
observe
how
cleverly
this
vine
has
forced
its
leaves
and
flowers
to
twine
themselves
into
a
bird
design
and
how
it
artful
turns
and
twists
hides
it
from
zealous
botanists
the
tern
the
turnip
illustration
the
tern
the
turnip
to
tell
the
turnip
from
the
tern
a
thing
which
everyone
should
learn
observe
the
tern
up
in
the
air
see
how
he
turns
and
now
compare
him
with
this
who
thus
to
turn
is
quite
unable
for
he
is
rooted
to
the
spot
while
as
we
see
the
tern
is
not
he
is
not
always
doomed
to
be
thus
bound
to
earth
for
cooked
to
a
tern
may
be
inferred
to
change
the
turnip
to
a
bird

observe
the
turnip
in
the
pot
the
tern
is
glad
that
he
is
not
the
larks
the
larkspur
illustration
the
larks
the
larkspur
you
must
not
make
remarks
about
my
drawing
of
the
larks
for
by
the
minor
poet
lore
the
larks
soar
while
larkspurs
bordering
garden
walks
are
perched
securely
on
their
stalks
cross

cross
bill
sweet

nobody
but
an
imbecile
mistakes
sweet
william
for
cross

and
even
i
can
scarcely
claim
the
skill
to
make
them
look
the
same
some
other
shrubs
and
vines
and
trees
express
emotion
much
like
these
you
seen
the

i
guess
and
weeping
willows
and
the
at
it
climax
the

the
the
ibis
the
illustration
the
ibis
the
the
sacred
ibis
one
might
say
was
classified
a
his
body
after
death
was
dried
embalmed
in
pitch
and
mummyfied
and
thus
was
handed
down
to
us
in
some
old
king
sarcophagus
the
mallow
growing
in
the
bogs
termed
by
pedagogues
is
much
opposed
to
dessication
and
bears
no
marks
of
veneration

the
jay
the

illustration
the
jay
the
bay
the
blue
jay
as
we
clearly
see
is
so
much
like
the
green
bay
tree
that
one
might
say
the
only
clue
lies
in
their
of
hue
and
if
you
have
a
color
sense
you
see
at
once
this
difference
the
the
illustration
the
the
the
reason
why
this
beetle
gay
is
called
the
they
say
is
just
because
he
wastes
his
hours
in
running
after
pretty
flowers
who
quite
regardless
of
conventions
most
openly
invite
attentions
and
hence
are
aptly
termed
the
puffin

good
darwin
once
contended
that
beetles
were
from

descended
and
as
my
pictures
show
i
think
the

must
be
the
missing
link
the

the
bunny
the
tunny
the
superficial
naturalists
have
often
been
misled
by
failing
to
discriminate
between
the
tail
and
head
it
really
is
unfortunate
such
carelessness
prevails
because
the
bunnies
have
their
heads
where
tunnies
have
their
tails
the
puss
the

the
puss
the
the
octopus
or
i
sure
that
none
of
us
would
wish
to
have
him
scuttle
the
house
like
puss
when
she
espies
a
mouse
when
secure
your
pet
be
very

you
do
not
get

octopus
or
there
may
be

the
marked
aversion
which
we
feel
when
in
the
presence
of
the
eel
makes
many
view
with
consternation
the
elephant
front
such
folly
must
be
clearly
due
to
their
peculiar
point
of
view
the
ant
the
illustration
the
ant
the
the
ant
is
known
by
his
the
any
and
that
is
why
he
wears
instead
a
small
red
cap
upon
his
head
without
his
fez
indeed
the
pheasant
would
be
quite
bald
and
quite
the
hare
the
harrier
illustration
the
hare
the
harrier
the
harrier
harassed
by
the
hare
presents
a
picture
of
despair
although
as
far
as
i
concerned
i
love
to
see
the
tables
turned
the
harrier
flies
with
all
his
might
it
is
a
flight
i
not
surprised
he
does
not
care
to
meet
the
fierce
pursuing
hare
the
the
illustration
the
the
we
have
for
many
years
been
bored
by
that
old
saw
about
the
sword
and
pen
and
now
we
all
rejoice
to
see
how
nature
made
her
choice
she
made
regardless
of
offendin
the
mightier
than
the
penguin
the
gnu

newt

the
gnu
the

the
gnu
conspicuously
wears
his
coat
of
gnumerous
bristling
hairs
while
as
we
see
the
modest
newt
of
such
a
coat
is
destitute
i
only
telling
this
to
you
and
it
is
strictly
entre
gnu
in
point
of
fact
the
newt
is
nude
and
therefore
he
does
not
obtrude
but
hides
in
some
secluded
gnook
beneath
the
surface
of
the
brook
it
almost
more
than
he
can
bear
to
issue
slyly
from
his
lair
and
snatch
a
hasty
breath
of
air
his
need
of
which
is
absolute
because
you
see
he
is

his
eyes
are
on

his

he
has

i
do
not
mind
the
raven
though
maligned
by
edgar
allan
poe
by
his
array
we
recognize
him
from
the

whose
epiderm
is
white
as

not
black

since
we
find
them

we
term

this
quite
explains

the

been
extinct

too
haughty
