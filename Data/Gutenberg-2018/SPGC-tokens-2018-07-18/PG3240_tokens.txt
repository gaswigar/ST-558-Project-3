a

for

perez
observed
captain
eri
cheerfully
i
tryin
to
average
up
with
the
mistakes
of
the
captain
was
seated
by
the
open
door
of
the
dining
room
in
the
rocker
with
the
patched
cane
seat
he
was
apparently
very
busy
doing
something
with
a
piece
of
fishline
and
a
pair
of
rubber
boots
captain
perez
swinging
back
and
forth
in
the
parlor
rocker
with
the
cushion
was
puffing
deliberately
at
a
wooden
pipe
the
bowl
of
which
was
carved
into
the
likeness
of
a
very
rakish
damsel
with
a
sailor
cap
set
upon
the
side
of
her
once
flaxen
head
in
response
to
his
companion
remark
he
lazily
turned
his
sunburned
face
toward
the
rocker
and
inquired
what
on
airth
are
you
doin
with
them
boots
captain
eri
tied
a
knot
with
his
fingers
and
teeth
and
then
held
the
boots
out
at
arm
length
why
perez
he
said
i
averagin
up
same
as
i
told
you
providence
made
me
a
critter
and
a
critter
needs
two
boots
i
always
been
able
to
find
one
of
these
boots
right
off
whenever
i
wanted
it
but
it
took
me
so
plaguey
long
to
find
the
other
one
that
whatever
wet
there
was
dried
up
afore
i
got
out
of
the
house
yesterday
when
i
wanted
to
go
clammin
i
found
the
left
one
on
the
mantelpiece
no
trouble
at
all
but
it
was
pretty
nigh
high
water
before
i
dug
the
other
one
out
of
the
that
why
i
splicin
together
this
way
i
do
want
to
promise
nothin
rash
but
i
in
hopes
that
even
jerry
ca
lose
humph
grunted
captain
perez
i
do
think
much
of
that
plan
of
losin
one
you
lose
both
of
yes
but
then
i
sha
care
if
there
ai
no
boots
in
sight
go
barefoot
or
stay
at
home
it
the
kind
of
responsibleness
that
goes
with
havin
one
boot
that
wearin
me
out
where
is
jerry
he
went
out
to
feed
lorenzo
i
heard
him
callin
a
minute
ago
that
cat
ai
been
home
sence
noon
and
jerry
a
stentorian
shout
of
puss
puss
come
kitty
kitty
kitty
came
from
somewhere
outside
captain
eri
smiled
i
lorenzo
gittin
dissipated
in
his
old
age
he
observed
then
as
a
fat
gray
cat
shot
past
the
door
there
he
is
prodigal
son
comes
home
when
the
fatted
a
moment
later
captain
jerry
appeared
milk
pitcher
in
hand
he
entered
the
dining
room
and
putting
the
pitcher
down
on
the
table
pulled
forward
the
armchair
with
the
painted
sunset
on
the
back
produced
his
own
pipe
and
proceeded
to
hunt
through
one
pocket
after
the
other
with
a
troubled
expression
of
countenance
where
in
tunket
is
my
terbacker
he
asked
after
finishing
the
round
of
pockets
and
preparing
to
begin
all
over
again
i
see
it
on
the
top
of
the
clock
a
spell
ago
said
captain
perez
was
that
yours
jerry
exclaimed
captain
eri
well
that
too
bad
i
see
it
there
and
thought
was
mine
here
is
or
what
left
of
captain
jerry
took
the
remnant
of
a
plug
from
his
friend
and
said
in
an
aggrieved
tone
that
jest
like
you
eri
never
have
a
place
for
nothin
and
help
yourself
to
anything
you
happen
to
want
do
make
no
odds
whose
is
why
do
you
take
care
of
your
terbacker
same
i
do
of
mine
now
see
here
jerry
i
ai
so
sure
that
is
yours
let
me
see
it

and
you
always

sweetheart

about

a
place
for
things
that
my
terbacker
if
you
want
to
know
observed
captain
perez
i
got
yours
eri
here

well
then
where

mine
said
captain
jerry
somewhat
snappishly
bet
a
dollar
you
got
it
in
your
pocket
said
captain
eri
bet
ten
dollars
i
ai
i
ai
quite
a
fool
yit
eri
hedge
i
guess
i
know
well
i
snum
i
forgot
that
upper
vest
pocket
and
from
the
pocket
mentioned
captain
jerry
produced
the
missing
tobacco
there
was
a
general
laugh
in
which
captain
jerry
was
obliged
to
join
and
the
trio
smoked
in
silence
for
a
time
while
the
expanse
of
water
to
the
eastward
darkened
and
the
outer
beach
became
but
a
dusky
streak
separating
the
ocean
from
the
inner
bay
at
length
captain
perez
rose
and
knocking
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
announced
that
he
was
going
to
show
a
yes
go
ahead
jerry
said
captain
eri
it
gittin
it
darker
in
the
grave
observed
captain
perez
with
lugubrious
philosophy
then
for
the
land
sake
let
have
it
light
while
we
can
here
jerry
them
matches
is
burnt
ones
try
this
be
so
damagin
to
the
captain
jerry
took
the
proffered
match
and
lit
the
two
bracket
lamps
fastened
to
the
walls
of
the
dining
room
the
room
seen
by
the
lamplight
was
shiplike
but
as
decidedly
not
shipshape
the
chronometer
on
the
mantel
was
obscured
by
a
thick
layer
of
dust
the
three
gorgeous
oil
paintings
from
the
brush
of
the
local
sign
painter
respectively
representing
the
coasting
packet
hannah
eri
hedge
master
and
the
fishing
schooners
georgie
baker
jeremiah
burgess
master
and
the
flying
duck
perez
ryder
master
were
shrouded
in
a
very
realistic
fog
of
the
same
dust
even
the
imposing
set
of
lives
of
great
naval
commanders
purchased
by
captain
perez
some
months
before
and
being
slowly
paid
for
on
an
apparently
installment
plan
was
cloaked
with
it
the
heap
of
newspapers
shoved
under
the
couch
to
get
them
out
of
the
way
peeped
forth
in
a
manner
the
windows
were
not
too
clean
and
the
floor
needed
sweeping
incidentally
the
supper
table
had
not
been
cleared
each
one
of
the
three
noted
these
things
and
each
sighed
then
captain
eri
said
as
if
to
change
the
subject
though
no
one
had
spoken
what
started
you
talkin
about
the
grave
perez
was
it
them
clam
fritters
of
jerry
no
answered
the
of
the
flying
duck
pulling
at
his
grizzled
scrap
of
throat
whisker
and
looking
rather
shamefaced
you
see
busteed
dropped
in
a
few
minutes
this
mornin
while
you
fellers
was
out
and
both
captain
eri
and
captain
jerry
set
up
a
hilarious
shout
haw
haw
roared
the
former
slapping
his
knee
i
would
be
so
fascinatin
as
you
be
for
no
money
perez
she
have
you
yit
you
ca
git
away
but
say
i
do
wonder
you
got
to
thinkin
the
grave
ten
minutes
of
gits
me
thinkin
of
things
way
side
of
that
aw
belay
there
eri
protested
captain
perez
testily
my
fault
i
did
see
her
comin
or
i
have
got
out
of
sight
she
was
cruisin
the
way
she
always
does
with
a
cargo
of
gabble
and
she
put
in
here
to
unload
talk
i
never
heard
a
woman
talk
the
way
she
can
she
be
a
good
one
to
have
on
board
in
a
calm
git
her
talkin
abaft
the
and
we
have
a
breeze
in
a
what
was
it
this
time
asked
captain
jerry
oh
a
little
of
everything
she
begun
about
the
sermon
that
perley
preached
at
the
last
meetin
that
was
what
started
me
thinkin
about
the
grave
i
guess
then
she
pitched
into
seth
wingate
wife
for
havin
a
new
bunnit
this
season
when
the
old
one
wa
wore
out
she
talked
for
ten
minutes
or
so
on
that
and
then
she
begun
about
parker
bein
let
go
over
at
the
cable
station
and
about
the
new
feller
that
been
signed
to
take
his
place
she
all
for
parker
says
he
was
a
lovely
man
and
that
was
outrageous
the
way
he
was
treated
and
all
that
sort
of
she
ai
the
only
one
that
thinks
so
observed
captain
jerry
there
a
heap
of
folks
in
this
town
that
think
parker
was
a
mighty
fine
yes
said
captain
eri
and
it
worth
while
noticin
who
they
be
perez
friend
thinks
so
and
wixon
and
his
gang
think
so
and
saunders
thinks
so
and
a
lot
more
like
them
parker
was
too
good
a
feller
that
what
was
the
matter
with
him
his
talk
always
reminded
me
of
washday
at
the
poorhouse
lots
of
soft
soap
with
plenty
of
lye
in
well
says
that
the
men
over
to
the
station
all
except
langley
of
course
are
mad
as
all
because
parker
was
let
go
and
she
says
somebody
told
somebody
else
and
somebody
else
told
somebody
else
and
somebody
else
told
her
she
says
it
come
reel
straight
that
the
men
are
goin
to
make
it
hot
for
the
new
feller
when
he
comes
she
says
his
name
hazeltine
or
somethin
like
that
and
that
he
goin
to
get
here
or
next
well
said
captain
eri
it
a
mercy
found
it
out
if
that
man
should
git
here
and
she
not
know
it
aforehand
kill
her
sure
as
fate
and
think
what
a
blow
that
would
be
to
you
he
took
his
watch
from
his
pocket
and
glanced
at
the
dial
i
must
be
settin
round
here
much
longer
he
added
john
goin
to
have
that
little
patch
of
cranberry
swamp
of
his
picked
and
he
expectin
some
barrels
down
on
train
john
asked
me
to
git
zoeth
cahoon
to
cart
down
for
him
but
i
got
nothin
special
to
do
so
i
thought
i
hitch
up
and
go
and
git
myself
you
and
jerry
can
match
cents
to
see
who
does
the
dishes
i
did
last
night
so
it
my
watch
well

declared
captain
perez
blessed
if
i
do
the
durn
things
if
the
president
of
the
united
states
asked
me
humph
sputtered
captain
jerry
i
you
fellers
think
i
do
all
the
time
if
you
do
you
mistook
that
all
last
night
you
done
eri
was
the
night
afore
i
done
last
night
and
i
ready
to
take
my
chances
agin
if

but
i
jiggered
if
i
let
you
shove
the
whole
thing
off
onto
me
i
did
ship
for
cook
no
more
the
rest
of
neither
of
the
others
saw
fit
to
answer
this
declaration
of
independence
and
there
was
a
pause
in
the
conversation
then
captain
jerry
said
moodily
it
ai
no
use
it
do
what
do
work
asked
captain
eri
why
this
plan
of
ours
i
thought
when
we
fellers
give
up
goin
to
sea
and
settled
down
here
to
keep
house
ourselves
and
live
economical
and
all
that
that
was
goin
to
be
fine
i
thought
i
would
mind
doin
my
share
of
the
work
a
bit
thought
be
kind
of
fun
to
swab
decks
and
all
that
well
was
for
a
spell
but
now
i
so
sick
of
it
that
i
do
know
what
to
do
and
i
sick
of
livin
in
a
pigpen
too
look
at
them
they
so
dirty
that
when
i
turn
out
in
the
mornin
and
go
to
look
through
i
ca
tell
whether
it
foul
weather
or
captain
eri
looked
at
the
windows
toward
which
his
friend
pointed
and
signed
assent
there
no
use
talkin
he
observed
we
got
to
have
a
steward
aboard
this
yes
said
captain
perez
emphatically
a
steward
or
a
a
woman
exclaimed
captain
eri
then
he
shook
his
head
solemnly
and
added
there
jerry
what
did
i
tell
you
but
captain
perez
did
not
smile
i
ai
foolin
he
said
i
mean
captain
jerry
thought
of
the
days
of
his
wife
dead
these
twenty
years
and
sighed
again
i
we
might
have
a
housekeeper
he
said
housekeeper
sneered
captain
eri
who
you
hire
perez
do
take
to
and
there
ai
nobody
else
in
orham
that
you
could
git
was
old
zuby
higgins
and
that
would
be
actin
like
the
feller
that
jumped
overboard
when
his
boat
sprung
a
leak
no
sir
if
zuby
ships
aboard
here
i
heave
up
my
who
said
anything
about
zuby
or
housekeepers
either
inquired
captain
perez
i
said
we
got
to
have
a
woman
and
we
have
one
of
us
have
to
git
married
that
married
roared
the
two
in
chorus
that
what
i
said
married
and
take
the
others
to
board
in
this
house
look
here
now
when
a
shipwrecked
crew
starvin
one
of
has
to
be
sacrificed
for
the
good
of
the
rest
and
that
what
we
got
to
do
one
of
us
has
got
to
git
married
for
the
benefit
of
the
other
captain
eri
shouted
hilariously
good
boy
perez
he
cried
goin
to
be
the
first
offerin
not
unless
it
my
luck
eri
we
all
three
match
for
it
same
as
we
do
washin
the
where
are
you
goin
to
find
a
wife
asked
captain
jerry
now
that
jest
what
i
goin
to
show
you
i
see
how
things
was
goin
and
i
been
thinkin
this
over
for
a
spell
hold
on
a
minute
till
i
overhaul
my
he
went
into
the
front
bedroom
and
through
the
open
door
they
could
see
him
turning
over
the
contents
of
the
chest
with
in
brass
nails
on
the
lid
he
scattered
about
him
hooks
lead
for
sinkers
oilcloth
jackets
whales
teeth
and
various
other
articles
and
at
length
came
back
bearing
a
sheet
of
printed
paper
this
he
spread
out
upon
the
dining
table
first
pushing
aside
the
dishes
to
make
room
and
after
adjusting
his
spectacles
said
triumphantly
there
there
she
is
the
chime
a
journal
of
matrimony
i
see
a
piece
about
it
in
the
herald
the
other
day
and
sent
a
dime
for
a
sample
copy
it
of
advertisements
from
women
that
wants
captain
eri
put
on
his
spectacles
and
hitched
his
chair
up
to
the
table
after
giving
the
pages
of
the
nuptial
chime
a
hurried
inspection
he
remarked
there
seems
to
be
a
strong
runnin
to
brunettes
and
with
tender
and
romantic
dispositions
which
of
them
kinds
are
you
sufferin
for
perez
oh
say
here
a
lady
that
willin
to
heave
herself
away
on
a
young
and
handsome
bachelor
with
a
income
of
ten
thousand
a
year
seems
to
me
you
ought
to
answer
oh
hush
up
eri
likely
i
want
to
write
to
any
of
them
in
there
the
thing
for
us
to
do
would
be
to
write
out
a
advertisement
of
our
own
tell
what
sort
of
woman
we
want
and
then
set
back
and
wait
for
answers
now
what
do
you
say
captain
eri
looked
at
the
advocate
of
matrimony
for
a
moment
without
speaking
then
he
said
do
you
really
mean
it
perez
sartin
i
what
do
you
think
of
it
jerry
think
it
a
good
idee
said
that
ancient
mariner
decisively
got
to
do
somethin
and
this
looks
like
the
only
sensible
then
eri
got
to
do
it
asserted
captain
perez
dogmatically
we
agreed
to
stick
together
and
two
to
one
a
vote
come
on
now
eri
we
captain
eri
hesitated
come
on
eri
ordered
captain
jerry
ai
goin
to
mutiny
are
you
all
right
said
captain
eri
i
stick
to
the
ship
only
he
added
with
a
quizzical
glance
at
his
companions
it
got
to
be
settled
that
the
feller
that
stuck
can
pick
his
wife
and
do
have
to
marry
unless
he
finds
one
that
suits
the
others
agreed
to
this
stipulation
and
captain
perez
drawing
a
long
breath
took
a
coin
from
his
pocket
flipped
it
in
the
air
and
covered
it
as
it
fell
on
the
table
with
a
big
hairy
hand
captain
eri
did
likewise
so
did
captain
jerry
then
captain
eri
lifted
his
hand
and
showed
the
coin
beneath
it
was
a
head
captain
jerry
was
a
tail
under
captain
perez
hand
lurked
the
hidden
fate
the
captain
lips
closed
in
a
grim
line
with
a
desperate
glance
at
the
others
he
jerked
his
hand
away
the
penny
lay
head
uppermost
captain
jerry
was
captain
eri
rose
glanced
at
his
watch
and
taking
his
hat
from
the
shelf
where
the
dishes
should
have
been
opened
the
door
before
he
went
out
however
he
turned
and
said
perez
you
and
jerry
can
be
fixin
up
the
advertisement
while
i
gone
you
can
let
me
see
it
when
i
come
back
i
say
jerry
he
added
to
the
sacrifice
who
sat
gazing
at
the
pennies
on
the
table
in
a
sort
of
trance
do
feel
bad
about
it
why
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
it
a
providence
it
turned
out
that
way
me
and
perez
are
bachelors
and
we
be
jest
green
hands
but
you
a
able
seaman
you
know
what
it
is
to
manage
a
yes
i
do
groaned
captain
jerry
lugubriously
durn
it
that
jest
it
captain
eri
was
chuckling
as
lantern
in
hand
he
passed
around
the
corner
of
the
little
white
house
on
the
way
to
the
barn
he
chuckled
all
through
the
harnessing
of
daniel
the
venerable
white
horse
he
was
still
chuckling
as
perched
on
the
seat
of
the
truck
wagon
he
rattled
and
shook
out
of
the
yard
and
turned
into
the
sandy
road
that
led
up
to
the
village
and
an
outsider
hearing
these
chuckles
and
knowing
what
had
gone
before
might
have
inferred
that
perhaps
captain
eri
did
not
view
the
matching
and
the
matrimonial
project
with
quite
the
deadly
seriousness
of
the
other
two
occupants
of
the
house
by
the
shore
chapter
ii
the
train
comes
in
there
is
in
orham
a
committee
whose
duty
it
is
to
see
the
train
come
in
the
committeemen
receive
no
salary
for
their
services
the
sole
compensation
is
the
pleasure
derived
from
the
sense
of
duty
done
rain
snow
or
shine
the
committee
is
on
hand
at
the
station
the
natives
of
course
call
it
the
deepo
to
consume
borrowed
tobacco
and
to
favor
providence
with
its
advice
concerning
the
running
of
the
universe
also
it
discusses
local
affairs
with
fluency
and
more
or
less
point
squealer
wixon
a
lifelong
member
of
this
committee
was
the
first
to
sight
captain
eri
as
the
latter
strolled
across
the
tracks
into
the
circle
of
light
from
the
station
lamps
the
captain
had
moored
daniel
to
a
picket
in
the
fence
over
by
the
he
had
heard
the
clock
in
the
belfry
of
the
methodist
church
strike
eight
as
he
drove
by
that
edifice
but
he
heard
no
whistle
from
the
direction
of
the
west
orham
woods
so
he
knew
that
the
down
train
would
arrive
at
its
usual
time
that
is
from
fifteen
to
twenty
minutes
behind
the
schedule
hey
shouted
wixon
with
enthusiasm
here
eri
well
cap
how
she
headin
by
was
the
calm
reply
runnin
fair
but
with
lookout
for
wind
hai
got
a
spare
chaw
nowheres
about
you
have
you
anxiously
inquired
bluey
batcheldor
batcheldor
is
called
bluey
for
the
same
reason
that
wixon
is
called
squealer
and
that
reason
has
been
forgotten
for
years
captain
eri
obligingly
produced
a
black
plug
of
smoking
tobacco
and
batcheldor
bit
off
and
returned
the
balance
after
adjusting
the
morsel
so
that
it
might
interfere
in
the
least
degree
with
his
vocal
machinery
he
drawled
i
you
ai
heard
the
news
eri
web
saunders
has
got
his
license
it
come
on
the
noon
the
captain
turned
sharply
toward
the
speaker
is
that
a
fact
he
asked
who
told
you
see
it
myself
so
did
squealer
and
a
whole
lot
more
web
was
showin
it
we
was
wonderin
said
jabez
smalley
a
member
of
the
committee
whose
standing
was
somewhat
impaired
inasmuch
as
he
went
fishing
occasionally
and
was
therefore
obliged
to
miss
some
of
the
meetings
what
kind
of
a
fit
john
baxter
would
have
now
he
been
pretty
nigh
distracted
ever
sence
web
started
his
billiard
room
callin
it
a
of
sin
and
a
whole
lot
more
names
there
ai
been
a
meetin
i
do
know
when
that
he
ai
pitched
into
that
saloon
now
when
he
hears
that
web
goin
to
sell
rum
he
bust
a
biler
the
committee
received
this
prophecy
with
an
hilarious
shout
of
approval
and
each
member
began
to
talk
captain
eri
took
advantage
of
this
simultaneous
expression
of
opinion
to
walk
away
he
looked
in
at
the
window
of
the
exchanged
greetings
with
sam
hardy
the
stationmaster
and
then
leaned
against
the
corner
of
the
building
furthest
removed
from
wixon
and
his
friends
lit
his
pipe
and
puffed
thoughtfully
with
a
troubled
expression
on
his
face
from
the
clump
of
blackness
that
indicated
the
beginning
of
the
west
orham
woods
came
a
dismal
toot
then
two
shorter
ones
the
committee
sprang
to
its
feet
and
looked
interested
sam
hardy
came
out
of
the
ticket
office
the
a
boy
of
about
fourteen
with
a
disagreeable
air
of
cheap
smartness
sticking
out
all
over
him
left
his
seat
in
the
shadow
of
batcheldor
manly
form
tossed
a
cigarette
stump
away
and
loafed
over
to
the
vicinity
of
the
depot
wagon
which
was
backed
up
against
the
platform
captain
eri
knocked
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
and
put
that
veteran
in
his
pocket
the
train
was
really
coming
in
at
last
if
this
had
been
an
august
evening
instead
of
a
september
one
both
train
and
platform
would
have
been
crowded
but
the
butterfly
summer
maiden
had
flitted
and
as
is
his
wont
the
summer
man
had
flitted
after
her
so
the
passengers
who
alighted
from
the
two
coaches
that
with
the
freight
car
made
up
the
orham
branch
train
were
few
in
number
and
homely
in
flavor
there
was
a
very
stout
lady
with
a
canvas
extension
case
and
an
umbrella
in
one
hand
and
a
bulging
and
a
pasteboard
box
in
the
other
who
panted
and
wheezed
like
the
locomotive
itself
and
who
asked
the
brakeman
what
on
airth
do
they
have
such
high
steps
for
there
was
a
slim
not
to
say
gawky
individual
with
a
chin
beard
and
rubber
boots
whom
the
committee
hailed
as
andy
and
welcomed
to
its
bosom
there
were
two
young
men
drummers
evidently
who
nodded
to
hardy
and
seemed
very
much
at
home
also
there
was
another
young
man
and
who
deposited
a
on
the
platform
and
looked
about
him
with
the
air
of
being
very
far
from
home
indeed
the
drummers
and
the
stout
lady
got
into
the
stage
the
young
man
with
the
picked
up
the
latter
and
walked
toward
the
same
vehicle
he
accosted
the
sharp
boy
who
had
lighted
another
cigarette
can
you
direct
me
to
the
cable
station
he
asked
sure
thing
said
the
youth
and
there
was
no
cape
cod
twist
to
his
accent
git
i
did
intend
to
ride
said
the
stranger
what
was
you
goin
to
do
walk
yes
if
it
not
the
boy
grinned
and
the
members
of
the
committee
who
had
been
staring
with
all
their
might
grinned
also
the
young
man
mention
of
the
cable
station
seemed
to
have
caused
considerable
excitement
oh
it
ai
too
far
said
the
then
he
added
say
you
the
new
electrician
ai
you
the
young
man
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
he
said
yes
and
suggested
i
asked
the
two
blocks
to
the
right
that
the
main
road
keep
on
that
for
four
blocks
then
turn
to
the
left
and
if
you
keep
on
straight
ahead
get
to
the
blocks
the
stranger
smiled
i
think
you
must
be
from
new
do
you
inquired
the
youthful
prodigy
climbing
to
the
wagon
seat
do
forget
to
keep
straight
ahead
after
you
turn
off
the
main
road
git
dap
so
long
fellers
he
leaned
over
the
wheel
as
the
stage
turned
and
bestowed
a
wink
upon
the
delighted
squealer
who
was
holding
one
freckled
paw
over
his
mouth
then
the
depot
wagon
creaked
away
the
young
man
looked
after
the
equipage
with
an
odd
expression
of
countenance
then
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
picked
up
the
suitcase
and
walked
off
the
platform
into
the
darkness
wixon
removed
the
hand
from
his
mouth
and
displayed
a
mammoth
grin
that
grew
into
a
shriek
of
laughter
in
which
every
member
of
the
committee
joined
haw
haw
bellowed
bluey
so
that
the
feller
that
done
parker
out
of
his
job
well
he
may
be
mighty
smart
but
if
that
joe
bartlett
smarter
then
i
a
skate
that
all
smartest
boy
ever
i
see
you
keep
on
straight
ahead
you
git
to
the
station
gosh
he
have
to
wear
rubbers
maybe
he
suggested
smalley
and
they
laughed
again
a
little
later
captain
eri
with
a
dozen
new
cranberry
barrels
in
the
wagon
behind
him
drove
slowly
down
the
depot
it
was
a
clear
night
but
there
was
no
moon
and
orham
was
almost
at
its
darkest
which
is
very
dark
indeed
the
depot
road
please
bear
in
mind
that
there
are
no
streets
in
orham
was
full
of
ruts
and
although
daniel
knew
his
way
and
did
his
best
to
follow
it
the
cranberry
barrels
rattled
and
shook
in
lively
fashion
there
are
few
homes
near
the
station
and
the
dwellers
in
them
conscientiously
refrain
from
showing
lights
except
in
the
ends
of
the
buildings
furthest
from
the
front
strangers
are
inclined
to
wonder
at
this
but
when
they
become
better
acquainted
with
the
town
and
its
people
they
come
to
know
that
front
gates
and
parlors
are
by
the
majority
of
the
inhabitants
restricted
in
their
use
to
occasions
such
as
a
funeral
or
possibly
a
wedding
for
the
average
orham
family
to
sit
in
the
parlor
on
a
week
evening
would
be
an
act
bordering
pretty
closely
on
sacrilege
it
is
from
the
hill
by
the
methodist
church
that
the
visitor
to
orham
gets
his
best
view
of
the
village
it
is
all
about
him
and
for
the
most
part
below
him
at
night
the
lights
in
the
houses
show
only
here
and
there
through
the
trees
but
those
on
the
beaches
and
at
sea
shine
out
plainly
the
brilliant
yellow
gleam
a
mile
away
is
from
the
orham
lighthouse
on
the
bluff
the
smaller
white
dot
marks
the
light
on
baker
beach
the
tiny
red
speck
in
the
distance
that
goes
and
comes
again
is
the
at
setuckit
point
and
the
twinkle
on
the
horizon
to
the
south
is
the
beacon
of
the
lightship
on
sand
hill
shoal
it
is
on
his
arrival
at
this
point
too
that
the
stranger
first
notices
the
sound
of
the
surf
being
a
newcomer
he
notices
this
at
once
after
he
has
been
in
the
village
a
few
weeks
he
ceases
to
notice
it
at
all
it
is
like
the
ticking
of
a
clock
so
incessant
and
regular
that
one
has
to
listen
intently
for
a
moment
or
two
before
his
accustomed
ear
will
single
it
out
and
make
it
definite
one
low
steady
continuous
roar
a
little
deeper
in
tone
when
the
wind
is
easterly
the
voice
of
the
old
dog
ocean
gnawing
with
foaming
mouth
at
the
bone
of
the
cape
and
growling
as
he
gnaws
it
may
be
that
the
young
man
with
the
square
shoulders
and
the
had
paused
at
the
turn
of
the
road
by
the
church
to
listen
to
this
song
of
the
sea
at
any
rate
he
was
there
and
when
captain
eri
steered
daniel
and
the
cranberry
barrels
around
the
corner
and
into
the
main
road
he
stepped
out
and
hailed
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
i
afraid
i
mixed
in
my
directions
the
told
me
the
way
to
the
cable
station
but
forgotten
whether
he
said
to
turn
to
the
right
when
i
reached
here
or
to
the
captain
eri
took
his
lantern
from
the
floor
of
the
wagon
and
held
it
up
he
had
seen
the
stranger
when
the
latter
left
the
train
but
he
had
not
heard
the
dialogue
with
josiah
bartlett
how
was
you
to
go
to
the
station
he
asked
why
i
intended
to
did
you
tell
them
fellers
at
the
depot
that
you
wanted
to
walk
well
i
swan
and
they
give
you
the
direction
yes
a
little
impatiently
why
should
they
so
many
blocks
till
i
got
to
the
main
street
or
road
and
so
many
more
till
i
got
somewhere
else
and
then
straight
blocks
hey
that
joe
bartlett
that
boy
ought
to
be
mastheaded
and
i
told
perez
so
once
well
mister
i
guess
maybe
you
better
not
try
to
walk
to
the
cable
station
you
see
there
one
thing
they
forgot
to
tell
you
the
station
on
the
outer
beach
and
there
a
mile
of
pretty
wet
water
between
here
and
the
young
man
whistled
you
do
mean
it
he
exclaimed
i
sartin
do
unless
there
been
an
almighty
drought
since
i
left
the
house
i
tell
you
what
if
you
jump
in
here
with
me
and
do
mind
waitin
till
i
leave
these
barrels
at
the
house
of
the
man
that
owns
i
drive
you
down
to
the
shore
and
maybe
find
somebody
to
row
you
over
that
is
with
a
chuckle
if
you
ai
dead
set
on
the
stranger
laughed
heartily
i
not
so
stubborn
as
all
that
he
said
it
mighty
good
of
you
all
the
do
say
a
word
said
the
captain
give
us
your
satchel
now
your
flipper
there
you
are
git
dap
daniel
accepted
the
captain
command
in
a
tolerant
spirit
he
paddled
along
at
a
for
perhaps
a
hundred
yards
and
then
evidently
feeling
that
he
had
done
all
that
could
be
expected
settled
back
into
a
walk
the
captain
turned
towards
his
companion
on
the
seat
i
do
know
as
i
mentioned
it
he
observed
but
my
name
is
glad
to
meet
you
hedge
said
the
stranger
my
name
is
i
kind
of
jedged
it
might
be
when
you
said
you
wanted
to
git
to
the
cable
station
we
heard
you
was
did
you
from
langley
i
not
of
course
we
knew
parker
had
been
let
go
and
that
somebody
would
have
to
take
his
place
i
guess
likely
it
was
one
of
the
operators
that
told
it
fust
that
you
was
the
man
but
anyhow
it
got
as
fur
as
busteed
and
after
that
was
plain
sailin
you
come
from
new
york
do
you
well
you
know
how
is
when
a
thing
gits
into
the
papers
orham
big
enough
to
have
a
paper
of
its
own
so
the
almighty
give
us
i
jedge
as
a
sort
of
substitute
she
can
spread
a
little
news
over
more
country
than
anybody
i
know
if
she
spreads
butter
the
same
way
she
could
make
money
keepin
boarders
is
this
your
fust
visit
to
the
cape
yes
i
hardly
know
why
i
here
now
i
have
been
with
the
cable
company
at
their
new
york
experimental
station
for
some
years
and
the
other
day
the
general
manager
called
me
into
his
office
and
told
me
i
was
expected
to
take
the
position
of
electrician
here
i
thought
it
might
add
to
my
experience
so
i
humph
did
he
say
anything
about
the
general
liveliness
of
things
around
the
station
hazeltine
laughed
why
he
answered
now
that
you
speak
of
it
i
remember
that
he
began
by
asking
me
if
i
had
any
marked
objection
to
premature
the
captain
chuckled
the
outer
beach
in
winter
ai
exactly
a
for
sociableness
he
said
and
the
idea
of
that
bartlett
boy
tellin
you
how
to
walk
there
is
he
a
specimen
of
your
cape
cod
youngsters
not
exactly
he
a
new
shipment
from
new
york
of
a
messmate
of
mine
perez
ryder
perez
he
a
bachelor
but
his
sister
daughter

a
feller
named
bartlett

to
run

the
captain
anyhow
perez

of

loose
as
yer

say

to
school
when
he
had
to

and
she
made
perez
promise
he
being
the
only
relation
the
youngster
had
to
fetch
the
boy
down
here
and
sort
of
bring
him
up
perez
knows
as
much
about
bringing
up
a
boy
as
a
hen
does
about
the
ten
commandments
and
made
him
promise
not
to
lick
the
youngster
and
a
whole
lot
more
foolishness
school
do
commence
here
till
october
so
we
got
him

the
stable
boardin
with
lem

he
ai
a
reel
bad

but
he

too
much
some
things

not
enough
others
you
seen
fellers
like
that
maybe
hazeltine
nodded
there
are
a
good
many
of
that
kind
in
new
york
afraid
he
said
captain
eri
smiled
i
should
wonder
he
observed
the
boys
down
here
think
josiah
the
whole
crew
and
the
girls
ai
fur
behind
there
been
more
deviltry
in
this
village
sence
he
landed
than
there
ever
was
afore
he
needs
somethin
and
needs
it
bad
but
i
decided
jest
what
it
is
yit
are
you
a
married
man
same
here
never
had
the
disease
perez
he
had
symptoms
every
once
in
a
while
but
nothin
lastin
jerry
the
only
one
of
us
three
been
through
the
mill
his
wife
died
twenty
year
ago
i
do
know
as
i
told
you
but
jerry
and
perez
and
me
are
keepin
house
down
by
the
shore
that
is
we
call
it
keepin
house
but
here
the
captain
broke
off
and
seemed
to
meditate
ralph
hazeltine
forbore
to
interrupt
and
occupied
himself
by
scrutinizing
the
buildings
that
they
were
passing
they
were
nearing
the
center
of
the
town
now
and
the
houses
were
closer
together
than
they
had
been
on
the
depot
road
but
never
so
close
as
to
be
in
the
least
crowded
each
house
had
its
ample
front
yard
and
the
new
arrival
could
smell
the
box
hedges
and
see
now
and
then
the
whiteness
of
the
kalsomined
stones
that
bordered
a
driveway
it
was
too
dark
for
the
big
seashells
at
the
front
steps
to
be
visible
but
they
were
there
all
the
same
every
third
house
of
respectability
in
orham
has
them
there
was
an
occasional
shop
too
with
signs
like
cape
cod
variety
store
or
the
boston
dry
goods
emporium
over
their
doors
on
the
platform
of
one
a
small
crowd
was
gathered
and
from
the
interior
came
shouts
of
laughter
and
the
sound
of
a
piano
that
the
billiard
saloon
volunteered
captain
eri
suddenly
waking
from
his
trance
play
pool
hazeltine
what
d
play
it
with
why
with
a
cue
generally
that
so
most
of
the
fellers
in
there
play
it
with
their
mouths
miss
a
shot
and
then
spend
the
rest
of
the
evenin
tellin
how
it
i
do
think
i
should
care
to
play
it
that
way
said
ralph
laughing
well
it
has
its
good
kind
of
exercise
develops
the
lungs
and
strengthens
the
muscles
as
the
almanac
says
parker
played
it
i
judge
that
your
opinion
of
my
predecessor
is
a
high
who
oh
parker
he
was
all
right
in
his
way
good
many
folks
in
this
town
swore
by
him
i
understand
the
fellers
over
at
the
station
thought
he
was
about
the
mr
langley
included
oh
langley
bein
manager
had
his
own
ideas
i
langley
do
play
pool
much
not
at
web
saunders
place
anyhow
we
turn
in
they
rolled
up
a
long
driveway
very
dark
and
overgrown
with
trees
and
drew
up
at
the
back
door
of
a
house
there
was
a
light
in
the
kitchen
window
whoa
commanded
the
captain
then
he
began
to
shout
ship
ahoy
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
the
kitchen
door
opened
and
a
man
came
out
carrying
a
lamp
its
light
shining
full
upon
his
face
it
was
an
old
face
a
stern
face
with
white
eyebrows
and
a
mouth
just
such
a
face
as
looked
on
with
approval
when
the
executioner
held
up
the
head
of
charles
at
whitehall
there
was
however
a
tremble
about
the
chin
that
told
of
infirm
health
hello
john
said
captain
eri
heartily
john
let
me
make
you
acquainted
with
hazeltine
the
new
man
at
the
cable
station
hazeltine
this
is
my
friend
john
the
two
shook
hands
and
then
captain
eri
said
john
i
brought
down
them
barrels
for
you
hawkins
got
here
same
as
he
always
does
by
the
skin
of
his
teeth
stand
by
now
got
to
deliver
hazeltine
at
the
station
and
it
gittin
john
baxter
said
nothing
beyond
thanking
his
friend
for
the
good
turn
but
he
stood
by
as
directed
and
the
barrels
were
quickly
unloaded
as
they
were
about
to
drive
out
of
the
yard
captain
eri
turned
in
his
seat
and
said
john
guess
i
be
up
some
time
i
want
to
talk
with
you
about
that
the
lamp
in
baxter
hand
shook
god
got
his
eye
on
that
place
eri
hedge
he
shouted
and
on
them
that
runnin
it
that
all
right
said
the
captain
then
the
job
in
good
hands
and
we
ai
got
to
worry
but
in
spite
of
this
assurance
hazeltine
noticed
that
his
driver
was
silent
and
preoccupied
until
they
reached
the
end
of
the
road
by
the
shore
when
he
brought
the
willing
daniel
to
a
stand
still
and
announced
that
it
was
time
to
change
it
is
a
row
from
the
mainland
to
the
outer
beach
and
captain
eri
made
it
on
schedule
time
hazeltine
protested
that
he
was
used
to
a
boat
and
could
go
alone
and
return
the
dory
in
the
morning
but
the
captain
would
hear
of
it
the
dory
slid
up
on
the
sand
and
the
passenger
climbed
out
the
sound
of
the
surf
on
the
ocean
side
of
the
beach
was
no
longer
a
steady
roar
it
was
broken
into
splashing
plunges
and
hisses
with
running
through
it
a
series
of
blows
like
those
of
a
muffled
hammer
the
wind
was
wet
and
smelt
salty
there
the
station
said
the
captain
pointing
to
a
row
of
lighted
windows
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
it
is
straight
ahead
this
time
and
the
walkin
it
has
been
for
the
last
few
minutes
the
electrician
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
hesitated
and
then
withdrew
it
empty
i
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
all
this
he
said
i
glad
to
have
made
your
acquaintance
and
i
hope
we
shall
see
each
other
same
here
said
the
captain
heartily
we
likely
to
git
together
once
in
a
while
seein
as
we
neighbors
right
across
the
road
as
you
might
say
that
my
berth
over
yonder
where
you
see
them
lights
it
jest
the
corner
from
the
road
we
drove
down
last
good
luck
to
you
and
he
settled
himself
for
the
row
home
chapter
iii
the
meeting
the
house
where
the
three
captains
lived
was
as
near
salt
water
as
it
could
be
and
remain
out
of
reach
of
the
highest
tides
when
captain
eri
after
beaching
and
anchoring
his
dory
and
stabling
daniel
for
the
night
entered
the
dining
room
he
found
his
two
messmates
deep
in
consultation
and
with
evidences
of
strenuous
mental
struggle
written
upon
their
faces
captain
perez
right
hand
was
smeared
with
ink
and
there
were
several
spatters
of
the
same
fluid
on
captain
jerry
perspiring
nose
crumpled
sheets
of
note
paper
were
on
the
table
and
floor
and
lorenzo
who
was
purring
restfully
upon
the
discarded
jackets
of
the
two
mariners
alone
seemed
to
be
enjoying
himself
well
you
fellers
look
as
if
you
had
a
rough
commented
captain
eri
slipping
out
of
his
own
jacket
and
pulling
his
chair
up
beside
those
of
his
friends
what
the
trouble
gosh
eri
i
glad
to
see
you
exclaimed
captain
perez
drawing
the
hand
just
referred
to
across
his
forehead
and
thereby
putting
that
portion
of
his
countenance
into
mourning
how
do
you
spell
conscientious
i
do
unless
it
owner
orders
was
the
answer
what
do
you
want
to
spell
it
for
we
writ
much
as
four
hundred
advertisements
i
do
believe
said
captain
jerry
and
there
ai
one
of
them
fit
to
feed
to
a
pig
perez
here
he
got
such
hifalutin
notions
that
nothin
less
than
a
circus
bill
do
him
do
see
why
somethin
plain
and
sensible
like
wanted
to
do
dishes
and
clean
house
for
three
men
would
be
all
right
but
no
it
got
to
have
more
fancy
trimmin
than
a
sunday
bunnit
foolishness
i
call
you
have
a
whole
lot
of
women
answerin
that
advertisement
now
would
you
snorted
captain
perez
hotly
do
dishes
for
three
men
that
a
healthy
bait
to
catch
a
wife
with
ai
it
i
can
see
comin
i
you
stay
single
till
jedgment
and
then
you
would
git
one
no
sir
the
thing
to
do
is
to
be
sort
of
and
let
think
they
goin
to
git
a
bargain
when
they
git
you
make
believe
it
goin
to
be
a
privilege
to
git
sech
a
well
is
declared
the
sacrifice
indignantly
they
might
git
a
worse
i
that
so
jerry
said
captain
eri
still
perez
altogether
wrong
guess
you
better
keep
the
dishwashin
out
of
it
i
know
dishwashin
would
never
git
me
i
got
so
i
hate
the
sight
of
soap
and
hot
water
as
bad
as
if
i
was
a
portugee
pass
me
that
captain
perez
gladly
relinquished
the
writing
materials
and
captain
eri
after
two
or
three
trials
by
which
he
added
to
the
paper
decorations
of
the
floor
produced
the
following
wife
wanted
by
an
man
of
steady
habbits
must
be
willing
to
work
and
keep
house
shipshape
and
aboveboard
no
need
apply
address
skipper
care
the
nuptial
chime
boston
the
line
relating
to
was
insisted
upon
by
captain
jerry
that
shut
out
the
tonguey
kind
he
explained
the
advertisement
with
this
addition
being
duly
approved
the
required
fifty
cents
was
inclosed
as
was
a
letter
to
the
editor
of
the
matrimonial
journal
requesting
all
answers
to
be
forwarded
to
captain
jeremiah
burgess
orham
mass
then
the
envelope
was
directed
and
the
stamp
affixed
there
said
captain
eri
that
done
all
you
got
to
do
now
jerry
is
to
pick
out
your
wife
and
let
us
know
what
you
want
for
a
weddin
present
you
a
lucky
aw
let
talk
about
somethin
else
said
the
lucky
one
rather
gloomily
what
the
news
up
at
the
depot
eri
they
received
the
tidings
of
the
coming
of
hazeltine
with
the
interest
due
to
such
an
event
captain
eri
gave
them
a
detailed
account
of
his
meeting
with
the
new
electrician
omitting
however
in
consideration
for
the
feelings
of
captain
perez
to
mention
the
fact
that
it
was
the
bartlett
boy
who
started
that
gentleman
upon
his
walk
to
the
cable
station
well
what
did
you
think
of
him
asked
captain
perez
when
the
recital
was
finished
seemed
to
me
like
a
pretty
good
feller
answered
captain
eri
deliberately
he
did
git
mad
at
the
joke
the
gang
played
on
him
for
one
thing
he
ai
so
as
parker
used
to
be
and
he
treat
baxter
and
me
as
if
cape
codders
was
a
kind
of
animals
the
way
some
of
the
summer
folks
do
he
had
the
sense
not
to
offer
to
pay
me
for
takin
him
over
to
the
station
and
i
liked
that
take
it
altogether
he
seemed
like
a
pretty
decent
chap
for
a
new
yorker
he
added
as
an
after
thought
but
say
he
said
a
moment
later
i
got
some
more
news
and
it
good
news
either
web
saunders
has
got
his
liquor
i
want
to
know
exclaimed
captain
perez
you
do
tell
me
said
captain
jerry
then
they
both
said
what
will
john
baxter
do
now
and
captain
eri
shook
his
head
dubiously
the
cod
bit
well
next
morning
and
captain
eri
did
not
get
in
from
the
windward
ledge
until
afternoon
by
the
way
it
may
be
well
to
explain
that
captain
jerry
remarks
concerning
settlin
down
and
restin
which
we
chronicled
in
the
first
chapter
must
not
be
accepted
too
literally
while
it
is
true
that
each
of
the
trio
had
given
up
long
voyages
it
is
equally
true
that
none
had
given
up
work
entirely
some
people
might
not
consider
it
restful
to
rise
at
four
every
weekday
morning
and
sail
in
a
catboat
twelve
miles
out
to
sea
and
haul
a
wet
cod
line
for
hours
not
to
mention
the
sail
home
and
the
cleaning
and
barreling
of
the
catch
captain
eri
did
that
captain
perez
was
what
he
called
stevedore
that
is
general
caretaker
during
the
absence
at
delancy
barry
summer
estate
on
the
cliff
as
for
captain
jerry
he
was
janitor
at
the
schoolhouse
the
catch
was
heavy
the
next
morning
as
has
been
said
and
by
the
time
the
last
fish
was
split
and
iced
and
the
last
barrel
sent
to
the
railway
station
it
was
almost
supper
time
captain
eri
had
intended
calling
on
baxter
early
in
the
day
but
now
he
determined
to
wait
until
after
supper
the
captain
had
bad
luck
in
the
matching
that
followed
the
meal
and
it
was
nearly
eight
before
he
finished
washing
dishes
this
distasteful
task
being
completed
he
set
out
for
the
baxter
homestead
the
captain
views
on
the
liquor
question
were
broader
than
those
of
many
orham
citizens
he
was
an
abstainer
generally
speaking
but
his
scruples
were
not
as
pronounced
as
those
of
miss
abigail
mullett
whose
proudest
boast
was
that
she
had
refused
brandy
when
the
doctor
prescribed
it
as
the
stimulant
needed
to
save
her
life
over
and
over
again
has
miss
abigail
told
it
in
how
she
riz
up
in
her
bed
expectin
every
breath
to
be
the
last
and
said
dr
palmer
if
it
got
to
be
liquor
or
death
then
death
referred
to
meaning
it
is
fair
to
presume
that
death
was
preferred
rather
than
the
brandy
with
much
more
concerning
her
miraculous
recovery
through
the
aid
of
a
terbacker
and
onion
on
general
principles
the
captain
objected
to
the
granting
of
a
license
to
a
fellow
like
web
saunders
but
it
was
the
effect
that
this
action
of
the
state
authorities
might
have
upon
his
friend
john
baxter
that
troubled
him
most
for
years
john
baxter
was
called
by
cape
cod
people
as
smart
a
skipper
as
ever
trod
a
he
saved
money
built
an
attractive
home
for
his
wife
and
daughter
and
would
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events
have
retired
to
enjoy
a
comfortable
old
age
but
his
wife
died
shortly
after
the
daughter
marriage
to
a
boston
man
and
on
a
voyage
to
manila
baxter
himself
suffered
from
a
sunstroke
and
a
subsequent
fever
that
left
him
a
physical
wreck
and
for
a
time
threatened
to
unsettle
his
reason
he
recovered
a
portion
of
his
health
and
the
threatened
insanity
disappeared
except
for
a
religious
fanaticism
that
caused
him
to
accept
the
bible
literally
and
to
interpret
it
accordingly
when
his
daughter
and
her
husband
were
drowned
in
the
terrible
city
of
belfast
disaster
it
is
an
orham
tradition
that
john
baxter
dressed
in
and
sitting
on
an
was
found
by
his
friends
mourning
in
what
he
believed
to
be
the
biblical
sackcloth
and
his
little
baby
granddaughter
had
been
looked
out
for
by
some
kind
friends
in
boston
only
captain
eri
knew
that
john
yearly
trip
to
boston
was
made
for
the
purpose
of
visiting
the
girl
who
was
his
sole
reminder
of
the
things
that
might
have
been
but
even
the
captain
did
not
know
that
the
money
that
paid
her
board
and
as
she
grew
older
for
her
gowns
and
schooling
came
from
the
bigoted
stern
old
hermit
living
alone
in
the
old
house
at
orham
in
orham
and
in
other
sections
of
the
cape
as
well
there
is
a
sect
called
by
the
ungodly
the
they
were
originally
seceders
from
the
methodist
churches
who
disapproved
of
modern
innovations
they
come
out
once
a
week
to
meet
at
the
houses
of
the
members
and
theirs
are
lively
meetings
john
baxter
was
a
and
ever
since
the
enterprising
saunders
opened
his
billiard
room
the
old
tirades
of
righteous
wrath
had
been
directed
against
this
den
of
iniquity
since
it
became
known
that
web
had
made
application
for
the
license
it
was
a
regular
amusement
for
the
unregenerate
to
attend
the
gatherings
of
the
and
hear
john
baxter
call
down
fire
from
heaven
upon
the
billiard
room
its
proprietor
and
its
patrons
orham
people
had
begun
to
say
that
john
baxter
was
and
john
baxter
was
captain
eri
friend
a
friendship
that
had
begun
in
school
when
the
declaimer
of
patrick
henry
liberty
or
death
speech
on
examination
day
took
a
fancy
to
and
refused
to
laugh
at
the
little
chap
who
tremblingly
ventured
to
assert
that
he
loved
little
pussy
her
coat
is
so
the
two
had
changed
places
until
now
it
was
captain
eri
who
protected
and
advised
when
the
captain
rapped
at
john
baxter
kitchen
door
no
one
answered
and
after
yelling
ship
ahoy
through
the
keyhole
a
number
of
times
he
was
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
his
friend
was
not
at
home
you
lookin
fer
baxter
queried
sarah
taylor
who
lived
just
across
the
road
he

up
to
barzilla
small
barzilla
small
lived
in
that
part
of
the
village
called
down
to
the
neck
and
when
the
captain
arrived
there
he
found
the
parlor
filled
with
the
devout
who
were
somewhat
surprised
to
see
him
why
how
do
you
do
said
small
resplendent
in
black
alpaca
and
wearing
her
jet
earrings
i
snum

a
reel

you
be
thankful
abigail
to
miss
mullett
who
sat
by
the
door
that
you
ai
got
nine
in
a
family
and
nobody
to
help
teach
manners
if
barzilla
was
like
most
men
he

some
in
the
house
but
no
i
have
to
do
it
all
and
small
thus
publicly
rebuked
rose
from
his
seat
in
the
corner
by
the
melodeon
and
proclaimed
in
a
voice
that
he
tried
hard
not
to
make
apologetic
now
luther
if
i
was
you
i
be
a
good
boy
and
mind
even
this
command
had
little
effect
upon
the
reluctant
luther
but
captain
eri
who
smiling
and
bowing
right
and
left
had
been
working
his
passage
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
announced
that
he
was
all
right
and
would
squeeze
in
on
the
sofy
of
so
there
was
peace
once
more
that
is
as
much
peace
as
half
a
dozen
feminine
tongues
all
busy
with
different
subjects
would
allow
why
eri
whispered
john
baxter
i
did
expect
to
see
you
here
glad
though
lord
knows
every
man
in
this
town
has
need
to
be
on
his
knees
this
night
have
you
heard
about
it
john
means
about
the
license
that
web
saunders
has
got
volunteered
miss
melissa
busteed
leaning
over
from
her
seat
in
the
patent
rocker
that
had
been
the
premium
earned
by
small
for
selling
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
of
tea
for
a
house
ai
it
awful
i
says
to
prissy
baker
this
mornin
soon
i
heard
of
it
s
i
be
a
jedgment
on
this
town
sure
a
livin
woman
s
i
says
she
so
s
she
and
i
says
well
when
miss
busteed
talks
interruptions
are
futile
so
captain
eri
sat
silent
as
the
comments
of
at
least
of
the
population
of
orham
were
poured
into
his
ears
the
recitation
was
cut
short
by
small
vigorous
pounding
on
the
center
table
we
blessed
this
evenin
said
the
hostess
with
emotion
in
perley
with
us
he
goin
to
lead
the
the
reverend
perley
reverend
by
courtesy
he
had
never
been
ordained
stood
up
cleared
his
throat
with
vigor
rose
an
inch
or
two
on
the
toes
of
a
very
squeaky
pair
of
boots
sank
to
heel
level
again
and
announced
that
everyone
would
join
in
singing
hymn
number
one
hundred
and
ten
omitting
the
second
and
fourth
stanzas
hymn
number
one
hundred
and
ten
second
and
fourth
stanzas
the
melodeon
tormented
by
lurania
bassett
shrieked
and
groaned
and
the
hymn
was
sung
so
was
another
and
yet
another
then
perley
squeaked
to
his
tiptoes
again
subsided
and
began
a
lengthy
and
fervent
discourse
perley
had
been
a
blacksmith
in
ostable
before
he
got
religion
and
now
spent
the
major
portion
of
his
time
in
boardin
with
up
and
down
the
cape
and
taking
part
in
their
meetings
his
services
at
such
gatherings
paid
for
his
food
and
lodging
he
had
been
a
vigorous
horseshoer
in
the
old
days
now
he
preached
just
as
vigorously
he
spoke
of
the
faithful
few
here
gathered
together
he
spoke
of
the
scoffing
of
those
outside
the
pale
and
hinted
at
the
uncomfortable
future
that
awaited
them
he
ran
over
the
various
denominations
one
by
one
and
one
by
one
showed
them
to
be
worshipers
of
idols
and
followers
after
strange
gods
he
sank
hoarsely
into
the
bass
and
quavered
up
into
falsetto
and
a
chorus
of
amens
and
hallelujahs
followed
him
oh
brothers
and
sisters
he
shouted
here
we
are
at
the
altar
foot
and
what
goin
on
outside
why
the
devil
got
his
clutches
in
our
midst
the
horn
of
the
wicked
is
exalted
sellin
rum
rum
in
this
town
they
rum
and
drinkin
of
it
and
gloryin
in
their
shame
but
the
lord
ai
asleep
he
got
his
eye
on
he
watchin
and
some
of
these
fine
days
he
send
down
fire
out
of
heaven
and
wipe
off
the
face
of
the
earth
amen
glory
glory
glory
john
baxter
was
on
his
feet
his
lean
face
working
the
perspiration
shining
on
his
forehead
his
eyes
gleaming
like
lamps
under
his
rough
white
eyebrows
and
his
clenched
fists
pounding
the
back
of
the
chair
in
front
of
him
his
hallelujahs
were
the
last
to
cease
captain
eri
had
to
use
some
little
force
to
pull
him
down
on
the
sofa
again
then
small
struck
up
oh
brother
have
you
heard
and
they
sang
it
with
enthusiasm
next
miss
mullett
told
her
story
of
the
brandy
and
the
defiance
of
the
doctor
nobody
seemed
much
interested
except
a
nervous
young
man
with
sandy
hair
and
a
celluloid
collar
who
had
come
with
tobias
wixon
and
was
evidently
a
stranger
he
had
not
heard
it
before
and
seemed
somewhat
puzzled
when
miss
abigail
repeated
the
death
referred
to
passage
there
was
more
singing
small
so
did
barzilla
with
many
hesitations
and
false
starts
and
an
air
of
relief
when
it
was
over
then
another
hymn
and
more
testimony
each
speaker
denouncing
the
billiard
saloon
then
john
baxter
arose
and
spoke
he
began
by
saying
that
the
people
of
orham
had
been
slothful
in
the
lord
vineyard
they
had
allowed
weeds
to
spring
up
and
wax
strong
they
had
been
tried
and
found
wanting
i
tell
you
brothers
and
sisters
he
declaimed
leaning
over
the
chair
back
and
shaking
a
thin
forefinger
in
perley
face
god
has
given
us
a
task
to
do
and
how
have
we
done
it
we
set
still
and
let
the
devil
have
his
way
we
talked
and
talked
but
what
have
we
done
nothin
nothin
at
all
and
now
the
grip
of
satan
is
tighter
on
the
town
than
it
ever
has
been
afore
the
lord
set
us
a
watch
to
keep
and
we
slept
on
watch
and
now
there
a
trap
set
for
every
young
man
in
this
do
you
think
that
that
down
yonder
is
goin
to
shut
up
because
we
talk
about
it
in
meetin
do
you
think
web
saunders
is
goin
to
quit
sellin
rum
because
we
say
he
ought
to
do
you
think
god
goin
to
walk
up
to
that
door
and
nail
it
up
himself
no
sir
he
do
work
that
way
we
talked
and
talked
and
now
it
time
to
do
ai
there
anybody
here
that
feels
a
call
ai
there
axes
to
chop
with
and
fire
to
burn
i
tell
you
brothers
we
waited
long
enough
i
old
as
i
am
am
ready
lord
here
i
am
here
i
am
he
swayed
broke
into
a
fit
of
coughing
and
sank
back
upon
the
sofa
trembling
all
over
and
still
muttering
that
he
was
ready
there
was
a
hushed
silence
for
a
moment
or
two
and
then
a
storm
of
hallelujahs
and
shouts
perley
started
another
hymn
and
it
was
sung
with
tremendous
enthusiasm
just
behind
the
nervous
young
man
with
the
celluloid
collar
sat
a
stout
individual
with
a
bald
head
this
was
abijah
thompson
known
by
the
irreverent
as
barking
thompson
a
nickname
bestowed
because
of
his
peculiar
habit
of
gradually
puffing
up
like
a
frog
under
religious
excitement
and
then
bursting
forth
in
an
inarticulate
shout
disconcerting
to
the
uninitiated
during
baxter
speech
and
the
singing
of
the
hymn
his
expansive
red
cheeks
had
been
distended
like
balloons
and
his
breath
came
shorter
and
shorter
perley
had
arisen
and
was
holding
up
his
hand
for
silence
when
with
one
terrific
boo
barking
thompson
spiritual
exaltation
exploded
directly
in
the
ear
of
the
nervous
stranger
the
young
man
shot
out
of
his
chair
as
if
thompson
had
fired
a
dynamite
charge
beneath
him
oh
the
devil
he
shrieked
and
then
subsided
blushing
to
the
back
of
his
neck
somehow
this
interruption
took
the
spirit
out
of
the
meeting
giggles
from
luther
and
the
younger
element
interfered
with
the
solemnity
of
perley
closing
remarks
and
no
one
else
was
brave
enough
to
testify
under
the
circumstances
they
sang
again
and
the
meeting
broke
up
the
nervous
young
man
was
the
first
one
to
leave
captain
eri
got
his
friend
out
of
the
clutches
of
the
as
quickly
as
possible
and
piloted
him
down
the
road
toward
his
home
john
baxter
was
silent
and
and
most
of
the
captain
cheerful
remarks
concerning
orham
affairs
in
general
went
unanswered
as
they
turned
in
at
the
gate
the
elder
man
said
eri
do
you
believe
that
man
law
ought
to
be
allowed
to
interfere
with
god
law
well
john
in
most
cases
it
my
jedgment
that
it
pays
to
steer
pretty
close
to
both
of
god
called
you
to
break
man
law
and
keep
his
what
would
you
do
guess
the
fust
thing
would
be
to
make
sure
was
the
almighty
that
was
callin
i
do
want
to
say
nothin
to
hurt
your
feelin
but
i
should
advise
the
feller
that
thought
that
he
had
that
kind
of
a
call
to
of
imitations
as
the
soap
folks
eri
i
got
a
now
john
baxter
you
listen
you
and
me
have
been
sailin
together
as
you
might
say
for
forty
odd
years
i
ai
a
religious
man
to
your
way
of
thinkin
but
i
generally
found
that
the
lord
runs
things
most
as
well
as
us
folks
could
run
when
there
a
leak
at
one
end
of
the
schooner
it
do
pay
to
bore
a
hole
at
the
other
end
to
let
the
water
out
do
you
worry
no
more
about
web
saunders
and
that
billiard
saloon
the
attend
to
them
afore
very
long
why
do
you
go
up
to
boston
for
a
couple
of
weeks
do
you
do
you
think
so
eri
well
maybe
maybe
sometimes
i
feel
as
if
my
head
was
kind
of
wearin
out
i
think
about
better
not
think
any
more
better
go
right
well
i
see
perez
said
captain
eri
next
day
seems
to
me
some
kinds
of
religion
is
like
whisky
mighty
bad
for
a
weak
head
i
wish
somebody
invent
a
gold
cure
for
chapter
iv
a
picture
sent
and
a
cable
tested
something
over
a
fortnight
went
by
and
the
three
captains
had
received
no
answers
from
the
advertisement
in
the
nuptial
chime
the
suspense
affected
each
of
them
in
a
different
manner
captain
jerry
was
nervous
and
apprehensive
he
said
nothing
and
asked
no
questions
but
it
was
noticeable
that
he
was
the
first
to
greet
the
carrier
of
the
mail
box
when
that
individual
came
down
the
road
and
as
the
days
passed
and
nothing
more
important
than
the
cape
cod
item
and
a
circular
came
to
hand
a
look
that
a
suspicious
person
might
have
deemed
expressive
of
hope
began
to
appear
in
his
face
captain
perez
on
the
contrary
grew
more
and
more
disgusted
with
the
delay
he
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
wondering
why
there
were
no
replies
and
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
suggest
writing
to
the
editor
of
the
chime
he
was
disposed
to
lay
the
blame
upon
captain
advertisement
and
hinted
that
the
latter
was
not
catchy
enough
captain
eri
alone
of
the
trio
got
any
amusement
out
of
the
situation
he
pretended
to
see
in
captain
jerry
an
impatient
bridegroom
and
administered
comfort
in
large
doses
by
suggesting
that
in
all
probability
there
had
been
so
many
replies
that
it
had
been
found
necessary
to
charter
a
to
bring
them
down
cheer
up
jerry
he
said
it
tough
on
you
i
know
but
think
of
all
them
poor
sufferin
females
that
settin
up
nights
and
worryin
for
fear
they
wo
be
picked
out
why
say
when
you
make
your
you
have
to
let
the
rest
know
right
off
be
cruelty
to
animals
not
to
you
ought
to
put
out
of
their
misery
captain
jerry
laugh
was
almost
dismal
the
first
batch
of
answers
from
the
chime
came
by
an
evening
mail
captain
eri
happened
to
beat
the
that
night
and
brought
them
home
himself
they
filled
three
of
his
pockets
to
overflowing
and
he
dumped
them
by
handfuls
on
the
dining
table
under
the
nose
of
the
pallid
jerry
what
did
i
tell
you
jerry
he
crowed
i
knew
they
was
on
the
way
what
have
you
got
to
say
about
my
advertisement
now
perez
there
were
letters
altogether
it
was
surprising
how
many
women
were
willing
even
anxious
to
ally
themselves
with
an
man
of
steady
but
most
of
the
applicants
were
of
unsatisfactory
types
as
captain
perez
expressed
it
there
too
many
of
them
everlastin
and
there
was
one
note
however
that
even
captain
eri
was
disposed
to
consider
seriously
it
was
postmarked
nantucket
was
written
on
half
a
sheet
of
paper
and
read
as
follows

skipper

saw
your
advertisements
in
the
paper
and
think
perhaps
you
might
suit
me

questions

return
mail

is
your
religious
belief

you
want
to

send

your
real
name

photograph

might
sign
articles

truly
martha

snow
nantucket

like
about

is
the
shipshape
way
she

it
commented
captain

that
she
adores
the
ocean

captain

seriously

oh

your

way
of

divilish

she
asked

i
ai
goin
to
have
her
if
she
do
suit
i
goin
to
marry
no
between
them
and
with
much
diplomacy
they
soothed
the
indignant
candidate
for
matrimony
until
he
agreed
to
sign
his
name
to
a
letter
to
the
nantucket
lady
then
captain
perez
said
but
i
say
jerry
she
wants
your
picture
have
you
got
one
to
send
her
i
got
that
daguerreotype
i
had
took
when
i
was
married
he
rummaged
it
out
of
his
chest
and
displayed
it
rather
proudly
it
showed
him
as
a
short
youth
whose
sunburned
face
beamed
from
the
depths
of
an
enormous
choker
and
whose
head
was
crowned
with
a
tall
silk
hat
of
a
forgotten
style
i
that
might
do
said
perez
hesitatingly
do
have
to
do
seein
it
all
he
got
said
captain
eri
good
land
he
chuckled
look
at
that
hat
say
jerry
she
think
you
done
your
seafarin
in
noah
but
captain
jerry
was
oblivious
to
sarcasm
just
then
he
was
gazing
at
the
daguerreotype
in
a
sentimental
sort
of
way
blowing
the
dust
from
the
glass
and
tilting
it
up
and
down
so
as
to
bring
it
to
the
most
effective
light
i
swan
he
mused
i
do
know
when
i
looked
at
that
afore
i
remember
when
i
bought
that
hat
jest
as
well
took
care
of
it
and
brushed
it
my
my
i
do
know
but
it
somewheres
around
now
i
thought
i
was
jest
about
the
ticket
then
and
and
i
bad
lookin
that
a
fact
this
last
with
a
burst
of
enthusiasm
ho
ho
perez
roared
captain
eri
jerry
fallin
in
love
with
his
own
picture
awful
thing
for
one
so
young
ai
it
i
ai
such
a
turrible
sight
older
you
be
eri
hedge
sputtered
the
prospective
bridegroom
with
righteous
indignation
then
he
added
in
a
rather
crestfallen
tone
but
i
am
a
heap
older
i
was
when
i
had
that
daguerreotype
took
see
here
if
i
send
that
nantucket
woman
this
picture
wo
she
notice
the
difference
when
she
sees
me
what
if
she
does
broke
in
captain
perez
you
can
tell
her
how
was
talk
her
over
a
feller
that
been
married
like
you
ought
to
be
able
to
talk
any
woman
captain
jerry
did
appear
sanguine
concerning
his
ability
to
talk
her
over
but
his
made
light
of
his
feeble
objections
and
the
daguerreotype
carefully
wrapped
was
mailed
the
next
morning
accompanied
by
a
brief
biographical
sketch
of
the
original
and
his
avowed
adherence
to
the
baptist
creed
and
the
good
templar
abstinence
i
hope
she
hurry
up
and
answer
said
the
impatient
captain
perez
i
want
to
get
this
thing
settled
one
way
or
another
do
you
jerry
yes
was
the
hesitating
reply
one
way
or
captain
eri
had
seen
john
baxter
several
times
since
the
evening
of
the
meeting
the
old
man
was
calmer
apparently
and
was
disposed
to
take
the
matter
less
seriously
particularly
as
it
was
reported
that
the
town
selectmen
were
to
hold
a
special
meeting
to
consider
the
question
of
allowing
saunders
to
continue
in
business
the
gentleman
had
given
what
he
was
pleased
to
call
a
to
his
regular
patrons
in
celebration
of
the
granting
of
the
license
and
squealer
wixon
and
one
or
two
more
spent
a
dreary
day
and
night
in
the
town
in
consequence
baxter
told
the
captain
that
he
had
not
yet
made
up
his
mind
concerning
the
proposed
boston
trip
but
he
thought
more
likely
he
should
go
captain
eri
was
obliged
to
be
content
with
this
assurance
but
he
determined
to
keep
a
close
watch
on
his
friend
just
the
same
he
had
met
ralph
hazeltine
once
or
twice
since
the
latter
arrival
in
orham
and
in
response
to
questions
as
to
how
he
was
getting
on
at
the
station
the
new
electrician
invariably
responded
gossip
however
in
the
person
of
miss
busteed
reported
that
the
operators
were
doing
their
best
to
keep
hazeltine
lot
from
being
altogether
a
bed
of
roses
and
there
were
dark
hints
of
something
more
to
come
on
the
morning
following
the
receipt
of
the
letter
from
the
nantucket
lady
captain
eri
was
busy
at
his
fish
shanty
putting
his
lines
in
order
and
sewing
a
patch
on
the
mainsail
of
his
catboat
these
necessary
repairs
had
prevented
his
taking
the
usual
trip
to
the
fishing
grounds
looking
up
from
his
work
he
saw
through
the
open
door
ralph
hazeltine
just
stepping
out
of
the
skiff
he
tucked
his
sail
needle
into
the
canvas
and
hailed
the
young
man
with
a
shouted
how
do
you
do
hedge
said
hazeltine
walking
toward
the
shanty
good
weather
is
it
long
the
wind
stays
westerly
and
there
ai
no
picnics
on
we
do
squabble
with
the
weather
folks
the
only
thing
that
fetch
a
squall
with
a
westerly
wind
is
a
picnic
that
do
it
sure
as
death
busy
over
across
pretty
busy
just
now
the
cable
parted
day
before
yesterday
and
been
getting
things
ready
for
the
repair
ship
she
was
due
this
morning
and
we
likely
to
hear
from
her
at
any
you
do
say
cable
broke
hey
now
it
a
queer
thing
but
i
never
been
inside
that
station
since
was
built
too
handy
i
guess
i
got
a
second
cousin
up
in
charlestown
lived
there
all
his
life
and
never
been
up
in
bunker
hill
monument
yit
fust
time
i
landed
in
boston
i
dug
for
that
monument
and
i
can
tell
you
how
many
steps
there
is
in
it
to
this
day
if
that
cable
station
was
fifty
mile
off
i
have
been
through
it
two
weeks
after
it
started
up
but
bein
jest
over
there
i
ai
ever
done
it
queer
ai
it
perhaps
you
like
to
go
over
with
me
i
going
up
to
the
and
when
i
come
back
i
should
be
glad
of
your
well
now
that
kind
of
you
i
i
will
you
might
sing
out
as
you
go
past
i
got
a
job
on
this
sail
and
then
it
my
watch
the
cable
station
at
orham
is
a
low
whitewashed
building
with
many
windows
the
vegetation
about
it
is
limited
exclusively
to
beach
grass
and
an
occasional
bush
the
nearest
building
which
may
be
reached
without
a
boat
is
the
station
two
miles
below
the
outer
beach
changes
its
shape
every
winter
the
gales
tear
great
holes
in
its
sides
and
then
as
if
in
recompense
throw
up
new
shoals
and
build
new
promontories
from
the
doorway
in
fair
weather
may
be
counted
the
sails
of
over
one
hundred
vessels
going
and
coming
between
boston
and
new
york
they
come
and
go
and
alas
sometimes
stop
by
the
way
then
the
crews
are
busy
and
the
boston
newspapers
report
another
wreck
all
up
and
down
the
outer
beach
are
the
bones
of
schooners
and
ships
and
all
about
them
and
partially
covering
them
is
sand
sand
sand
as
white
and
much
coarser
than
granulated
sugar
hazeltine
trip
and
other
errands
had
taken
much
more
time
than
he
anticipated
and
more
than
two
hours
had
gone
by
before
he
called
for
captain
eri
during
the
row
to
the
beach
the
electrician
explained
to
the
captain
the
processes
by
which
a
break
in
the
cable
is
located
and
repaired
you
see
he
said
as
soon
as
the
line
breaks
we
set
about
finding
where
it
is
broken
to
do
this
we
use
an
instrument
called
the
wheatstone
bridge
in
this
case
the
break
is
about
six
hundred
miles
from
the
american
shore
the
next
thing
is
to
get
at
the
repair
ship
she
lies
usually
at
halifax
when
she
is
busy
and
that
is
where
she
was
this
time
we
wired
her
and
she
left
for
the
spot
immediately
it
was
up
to
me
to
get
ready
the
testing
apparatus
we
generally
set
up
special
instruments
for
testing
judging
by
the
distance
the
ship
should
have
been
over
the
break
early
this
morning
she
will
grapple
for
the
broken
cable
ends
and
as
soon
as
she
catches
our
end
she
send
us
a
message
it
simple
like
takin
wormwood
tea
easy
enough
if
you
been
brought
up
that
way
i
think
i
make
more
money
catchin
codfish
myself
commented
the
captain
dryly
ralph
laughed
well
it
really
is
a
very
simple
matter
he
said
the
only
thing
we
have
to
be
sure
of
is
that
our
end
of
the
line
is
ready
by
the
time
the
ship
reaches
the
break
if
the
weather
is
bad
the
ship
ca
work
and
so
when
she
does
work
she
works
quick
i
had
my
instruments
in
condition
yesterday
so
we
all
right
this
they
landed
at
the
little
wharf
and
plodded
through
the
heavy
sand
place
is
it
said
hazeltine
as
he
opened
the
back
door
of
the
station
well
i
do
know
it
has
its
good
replied
his
companion
your
neighbors
hens
do
scratch
up
your
garden
for
one
thing
what
do
you
do
in
here
this
is
the
room
where
we
receive
and
send
this
is
the
the
captain
noticed
with
interest
the
recorder
with
its
two
brass
supports
and
the
little
glass
tube
half
filled
with
ink
that
when
the
cable
was
working
wrote
the
messages
upon
the
paper
tape
traveling
beneath
it
pretty
nigh
as
finicky
as
a
watch
ai
it
he
observed
fully
as
delicate
in
its
way
do
you
see
this
little
screw
on
the
centerpiece
turn
that
a
little
one
way
or
the
other
and
the
operator
on
the
other
side
might
send
until
doomsday
we
would
know
it
show
you
the
living
rooms
and
the
laboratory
just
then
the
door
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
opened
and
a
man
whom
captain
eri
recognized
as
one
of
the
operators
came
in
he
started
when
he
saw
hazeltine
and
turned
to
go
out
again
ralph
spoke
to
him
peters
he
said
where
is
langley
do
know
answered
the
fellow
gruffly
wait
a
minute
tell
me
where
langley
i
do
know
where
he
is
he
went
over
to
the
village
a
while
where
are
the
rest
of
the
men
do
the
impudence
and
thinly
veiled
hostility
in
the
man
tone
were
unmistakable
hazeltine
hesitated
seemed
about
to
speak
and
then
silently
led
the
way
to
the
hall
i
show
you
the
laboratory
later
on
he
said
we
go
up
to
the
testing
room
then
he
added
apparently
as
much
to
himself
as
to
his
visitor
i
told
those
fellows
that
i
would
be
back
until
there
was
a
door
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
ralph
opened
this
quietly
as
they
passed
through
captain
eri
noticed
that
peters
had
followed
them
into
the
hall
and
stood
there
looking
up
the
upper
hall
had
a
straw
matting
on
the
floor
there
was
another
door
at
the
end
of
the
passage
and
this
was
ajar
toward
it
the
electrician
walked
rapidly
from
the
room
behind
the
door
came
a
shout
of
laughter
then
someone
said
better
give
it
another
turn
had
i
to
make
sure
if
two
turns
fixes
it
so
we
do
hear
for
a
couple
of
hours
another
one
ought
to
shut
it
up
for
a
week
that
arithmetic
ai
it
the
laugh
that
followed
this
was
cut
short
by
hazeltine
throwing
the
door
wide
open
captain
eri
close
at
the
electrician
heels
saw
a
long
room
empty
save
for
a
few
chairs
and
a
table
in
the
center
upon
this
table
stood
the
testing
instruments
exactly
like
those
in
the
receiving
room
downstairs
three
men
lounged
in
the
chairs
and
standing
beside
the
table
with
his
fingers
upon
the
regulating
screw
at
the
centerpiece
of
the
recorder
was
another
a
big
fellow
with
a
round
face
the
men
in
the
chairs
sprang
to
their
feet
as
hazeltine
came
in
the
face
of
the
individual
by
the
table
turned
white
and
his
fingers
fell
from
the
regulating
screw
as
though
the
latter
were
red
hot
the
captain
recognized
the
men
they
were
day
operators
whom
he
had
met
in
the
village
many
times
incidentally
they
were
avowed
friends
of
the
former
electrician
parker
the
name
of
the
taller
one
was
mcloughlin
no
one
spoke
ralph
strode
quickly
to
the
table
pushed
mcloughlin
to
one
side
and
stooped
over
the
instruments
when
he
straightened
up
captain
eri
noticed
that
his
face
also
was
white
but
evidently
not
from
fear
he
turned
sharply
and
looked
at
the
four
operators
who
were
doing
their
best
to
appear
at
ease
and
not
succeeding
the
electrician
looked
them
over
one
by
one
then
he
gave
a
short
laugh
you
damned
sneaks
he
said
and
turned
again
to
the
testing
apparatus
he
began
slowly
to
turn
the
regulating
screw
on
the
recorder
he
had
given
it
but
a
few
revolutions
when
the
point
of
the
little
glass
siphon
that
had
been
tracing
a
straight
black
line
on
the
sliding
tape
moved
up
and
down
in
curving
zigzags
hazeltine
turned
to
the
operator
palmer
he
said
curtly
answer
that
the
man
addressed
seated
himself
at
the
table
turned
a
switch
and
clicked
off
a
message
after
a
moment
the
line
on
the
moving
tape
zigzagged
again
ralph
glanced
at
the
zigzags
and
bit
his
lip
apologize
to
them
he
said
to
palmer
tell
them
we
regret
exceedingly
that
the
ship
should
have
been
kept
waiting
tell
them
our
recorder
was
out
of
the
operator
cabled
the
message
the
three
men
at
the
end
of
the
room
glanced
at
each
other
this
evidently
was
not
what
they
expected
steps
sounded
on
the
stairs
and
peters
hurriedly
entered
the
old
man
comin
he
said
langley
the
superintendent
of
the
station
had
been
in
the
company
employ
for
years
he
had
been
in
charge
of
the
cape
cod
station
since
it
was
built
and
he
liked
the
job
he
knew
cable
work
too
from
a
to
z
and
though
he
was
a
strict
disciplinarian
would
forgive
a
man
getting
drunk
occasionally
sooner
than
condone
carelessness
he
was
eccentric
but
even
those
who
did
not
like
him
acknowledged
that
he
was
he
came
into
the
room
tossed
a
cigar
stump
out
of
the
window
and
nodded
to
captain
eri
how
are
you
captain
hedge
he
said
then
stepping
to
the
table
he
picked
up
the
tape
everything
all
right
hazeltine
he
asked
hello
what
does
this
mean
they
say
they
have
been
calling
for
two
hours
without
getting
an
answer
how
do
you
explain
that
it
was
very
quiet
in
the
room
when
the
electrician
answered
the
recorder
here
was
out
of
adjustment
sir
he
said
simply
out
of
adjustment
i
thought
you
told
me
everything
was
in
perfect
order
before
you
left
this
i
thought
so
sir
but
i
find
the
screw
was
too
loose
that
would
account
for
the
call
not
reaching
too
loose
humph
the
superintendent
looked
steadfastly
at
hazeltine
then
at
the
operators
and
then
at
the
electrician
once
more
mr
hazeltine
he
said
at
length
i
will
hear
what
explanations
you
may
have
to
make
in
my
office
later
on
i
will
attend
to
the
testing
myself
that
will
captain
eri
silently
followed
his
young
friend
to
the
back
door
of
the
station
hazeltine
had
seen
fit
to
make
no
comment
on
the
scene
just
described
and
the
captain
did
not
feel
like
offering
any
they
were
standing
on
the
steps
when
the
big
operator
mcloughlin
came
out
of
the
building
behind
them
well
he
said
gruffly
to
the
electrician
shall
i
quit
now
or
wait
until
saturday
what
shall
i
git
out
now
or
wait
till
saturday
night
i
suppose
you
have
me
then
hazeltine
rage
boiled
over
if
you
mean
that
i
tell
langley
of
your
cowardly
trick
and
have
you
discharged
no
i
do
pay
my
debts
that
way
but
i
tell
you
this
you
and
your
sneaking
friends
if
you
try
another
game
like
that
yes
or
if
you
so
much
as
speak
to
me
other
than
on
business
while
i
here
i
will
fire
you
out
of
the
window
clear
out
mr
hazeltine
said
captain
eri
a
few
moments
later
i
hope
you
mind
my
sayin
that
i
like
you
me
and
perez
and
jerry
the
biggest
bugs
in
town
but
we
like
to
have
our
friends
come
and
see
us
i
wish
you
drop
in
once
a
i
certainly
will
said
the
young
man
and
the
two
shook
hands
that
vigorous
handshake
was
enough
of
itself
to
convince
ralph
hazeltine
that
he
had
made
at
any
rate
one
friend
in
orham
and
we
may
as
well
add
here
that
he
had
made
two
for
that
evening
jack
mcloughlin
said
to
his
fellow
conspirators
he
said
he
fire
me
out
of
the
window
me
mind
you
and
by
thunder
i
believe
he
have
done
it
too
boys
there
ai
any
more
games
played
on
that
kid
while
i
around
parker
or
no
parker
he
white
that
what
he
is
chapter
v
the
woman
from
nantucket
conversation
among
the
captains
was
for
the
next
two
days
confined
to
two
topics
speculation
as
to
how
soon
they
might
expect
a
reply
from
the
nantucket
female
and
whether
or
not
langley
would
discharge
hazeltine
on
the
latter
point
captain
eri
was
decided
he
wo
be
bounced
said
the
captain
now
you
just
put
that
down
in
your
log
langley
ai
a
fool
and
he
can
put
two
and
two
together
as
well
as
the
next
feller
if
i
thought
there
was
any
need
of
it
i
just
drop
him
a
hint
myself
but
there
ai
so
i
sha
put
my
oar
in
but
i
wish
you
two
could
have
heard
that
youngster
talk
to
that
mcloughlin
critter
have
done
you
good
that
boy
all
captain
jerry
was
alone
when
the
expected
letter
came
he
glanced
at
the
postmark
saw
that
it
was
nantucket
and
stuck
the
note
behind
the
clock
he
did
his
best
to
forget
it
but
he
looked
so
guilty
when
captain
perez
returned
at
supper
time
that
that
individual
suspected
something
made
his
friend
confess
and
a
little
later
when
captain
eri
came
in
the
envelope
bearing
many
was
propped
up
against
the
sugar
bowl
in
the
middle
of
the
table
we
did
open
it
eri
said
perez
proudly
we
did
want
to
but
we
thought
all
hands
ought
to
be
on
deck
when
anything
as
important
as
this
was
goin
to
be
he
been
holdin
it
up
to
the
light
for
the
last
hour
sneered
captain
jerry
anybody
think
it
had
a
million
dollars
in
it
for
the
land
sake
open
it
eri
he
has
a
fit
captain
eri
picked
up
the
letter
looked
it
over
very
deliberately
and
then
tore
off
the
end
of
the
envelope
the
inclosure
was
another
sheet
of
note
paper
like
the
first
epistle
the
captain
took
out
his
spectacles
wiped
them
and
read
the
following
aloud
captain
jeremiah
burgess
sir
i
like
your
looks
well
enough
though
it
do
pay
to
put
too
much
dependence
in
looks
as
nobody
knows
better
than
me
besides
i
judge
that
picture
was
took
quite
a
spell
ago
anyway
you
look
honest
and
i
am
willing
to
risk
money
enough
to
carry
me
to
orham
and
back
though
the
dear
land
knows
i
ai
got
none
to
throw
away
if
we
do
agree
to
sign
articles
i
suppose
likely
you
will
be
willing
to
stand
half
the
fare
that
ai
any
more
than
right
the
way
i
look
at
it
i
shall
come
to
orham
on
the
afternoon
train
thursday
meet
me
at
the
depot
yours
truly
martha
b
snow
p
i
should
have
liked
it
better
if
you
was
a
methodist
but
we
ca
have
everything
just
as
we
want
it
in
this
nobody
spoke
for
a
moment
after
the
reading
of
this
intensely
practical
note
captain
eri
whistled
softly
scratched
his
head
and
then
read
the
letter
over
again
to
himself
at
length
captain
perez
broke
the
spell
jerusalem
he
exclaimed
she
do
lose
no
time
does
she
she
pretty
prompt
that
a
fact
assented
captain
eri
captain
jerry
burst
forth
in
indignation
is
that
all
you
got
to
say
he
inquired
with
sarcasm
after
gittin
me
into
a
scrape
like
this
well
now
i
tell
you
one
thing
i
do
go
on
your
beam
ends
jerry
interrupted
captain
eri
there
ai
no
harm
done
ai
no
harm
done
why
how
you
talk
eri
hedge
here
a
woman
that
i
ai
never
seen
and
might
be
a
hundred
years
old
for
all
i
know
comin
down
here
night
to
marry
me
by
main
force
as
you
might
say
and
you
set
here
and
talk
about
now
hold
on
hold
on
jerry
she
ai
goin
to
marry
you
unless
you
want
her
to
likely
more
i
think
of
it
the
more
i
like
the
woman
way
of
doin
things
she
got
sense
there
no
doubt
of
that
you
ca
sell
her
a
cat
in
a
bag
she
comin
down
here
to
see
you
and
talk
the
thing
over
and
i
glory
in
her
wants
me
to
pay
her
fare
i
see
myself
doin
it
i
got
ways
enough
to
spend
my
money
without
paying
fares
for
nantucket
if
you
and
she
sign
articles
as
she
calls
it
you
have
to
pay
more
than
fares
said
captain
perez
in
a
tone
i
think
same
as
eri
does
she
a
smart
woman
we
have
to
meet
her
at
the
depot
of
well
wo
cheeky
thing
let
her
find
out
where
i
am
i
she
have
to
do
some
now
see
here
jerry
said
captain
eri
you
was
jest
as
anxious
to
have
one
of
us
get
married
as
anybody
else
you
have
got
to
marry
the
woman
unless
you
want
to
but
you
have
got
to
help
us
see
the
thing
through
i
wish
myself
that
we
had
been
quite
so
pesky
anxious
to
give
her
the
latitude
and
longitude
and
had
took
some
sort
of
an
observation
ourselves
but
we
did
and
now
we
got
to
treat
her
decent
you
be
at
that
depot
along
with
perez
and
when
captain
eri
spoke
in
that
tone
his
two
cronies
usually
obeyed
orders
even
the
rebellious
jerry
who
had
a
profound
respect
for
his
younger
friend
gave
in
after
some
grumbling
they
sat
up
until
late
speculating
concerning
the
probable
age
and
appearance
of
the
expected
visitor
captain
perez
announced
that
he
did
know
why
it
was
but
he
had
a
notion
that
she
was
about
forty
and
slim
captain
jerry
who
was
in
a
frame
of
mind
where
agreement
with
anyone
was
out
of
the
question
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
she
was
thirty
odd
and
rather
plump
captain
eri
did
hazard
a
guess
but
suggested
that
they
wait
and
see
but
even
captain
eri
calmness
was
more
or
less
assumed
for
he
did
not
go
fishing
the
next
morning
but
stayed
about
the
house
whittling
at
the
model
of
a
clipper
ship
and
tormenting
captain
jerry
the
model
was
one
that
he
had
been
at
work
upon
at
odd
times
ever
since
he
gave
up
it
had
never
been
completed
for
the
very
good
reason
that
when
one
part
was
finished
the
captain
tore
another
part
to
pieces
and
began
over
again
it
was
a
sort
of
barometer
of
his
feelings
and
when
his
companions
saw
him
take
down
the
clipper
and
go
to
work
they
knew
he
was
either
thinking
deeply
upon
a
perplexing
problem
or
was
troubled
in
his
mind
captain
perez
sang
a
good
deal
principally
confining
his
musical
efforts
to
a
ballad
with
a
chorus
of
storm
along
john
john
storm
along
ai
i
glad
my
day
work
done
also
he
glanced
at
his
watch
every
few
minutes
and
then
went
to
consult
the
chronometer
to
make
sure
of
the
time
captain
jerry
went
up
to
the
schoolhouse
and
gave
its
vacant
rooms
a
thorough
sweeping
for
no
particular
reason
except
to
be
doing
something
his
appetite
was
poor
and
he
actually
forgot
to
feed
lorenzo
a
hitherto
slight
and
one
that
brought
down
upon
him
a
long
lecture
from
captain
eri
who
vowed
that
loss
of
memory
was
a
sure
sign
of
lovesickness
they
started
for
the
railway
station
immediately
after
supper
as
they
passed
john
baxter
house
they
noticed
a
light
in
an
upper
chamber
and
wondered
if
the
old
man
was
captain
eri
would
have
stopped
to
find
out
but
captain
perez
insisted
that
it
could
be
done
just
as
well
when
they
came
back
and
expressed
a
fear
that
they
might
miss
the
train
captain
jerry
had
spoken
since
they
left
home
and
walked
gloomily
ahead
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
web
saunders
fat
and
in
his
shirtsleeves
sat
upon
the
steps
of
his
saloon
as
they
went
by
he
wished
them
an
unctuous
the
oily
smoothness
of
saunders
voice
can
not
be
described
with
plain
pen
and
ink
it
gurgled
with
sweetness
like
molasses
poured
from
a
jug
this
was
not
a
special
tone
put
on
for
the
occasion
no
one
except
his
wife
ever
heard
him
speak
otherwise
the
response
from
the
three
captains
was
not
enthusiastic
but
saunders
continued
to
talk
of
the
weather
the
fishing
and
the
cranberry
crop
until
a
customer
came
and
gave
them
a
chance
to
get
away
slick
slick
slick
commented
captain
eri
as
they
hurried
along
blessed
if
he
do
pretty
nigh
purr
i
like
a
cat
but
always
suspicious
of
a
you
know
he
got
claws
but
you
tell
where
he
goin
to
use
when
a
feller
like
that
comes
around
and
rubbin
his
head
against
my
shin
i
always
feel
like
foot
ready
for
a
kick
you
pretty
sartin
to
need
it
one
time
or
the
train
was
nearly
an
hour
late
this
evening
owing
to
a
hot
box
and
the
man
and
his
two
friends
peered
anxiously
out
at
it
from
around
the
corner
of
the
station
the
one
coach
stopped
directly
under
the
lights
and
they
could
see
the
passengers
as
they
came
down
the
steps
two
or
three
got
out
but
these
were
men
then
came
an
apparition
that
caused
captain
jerry
to
gasp
and
clutch
at
perez
for
support
down
the
steps
of
the
car
came
a
tall
negress
and
in
her
hand
was
a
canvas
extension
case
on
the
side
of
which
was
blazoned
in
letters
the
fateful
name
m
b
snow
captain
eri
gazed
at
this
astounding
spectacle
for
a
full
thirty
seconds
then
he
woke
up
godfrey
domino
he
ejaculated
black
black
run
run
for
your
lives
she
sees
us
this
order
was
superfluous
captain
jerry
was
already
to
the
fence
and
going
at
a
rate
which
bid
fair
to
establish
a
record
for
his
age
the
others
fell
into
his
wake
and
the
procession
moved
across
country
like
a
steeplechase
they
climbed
over
stone
walls
and
splashed
into
meadows
they
took
every
short
cut
between
the
station
and
their
home
as
they
came
in
sight
of
the
latter
captain
perez
breath
gave
out
almost
entirely
heave
to
he
gasped
heave
to
or
i
founder
i
would
run
another
step
for
all
the
darkies
in
the
west
captain
eri
paused
but
it
was
only
after
a
struggle
that
captain
jerry
was
persuaded
to
halt
i
sha
do
it
eri
he
vowed
wildly
i
sha
do
it
there
ai
no
use
askin
me
i
wo
marry
that
black
woman
i
wo
by
thunder
there
there
jerry
said
captain
eri
soothingly
nobody
wants
you
to
there
ai
no
danger
now
she
did
see
ai
no
danger
there
you
go
again
eri
hedge
she
ask
where
i
live
and
come
right
down
in
the
depot
wagon
oh
lordy
lordy
the
frantic
sacrifice
was
about
to
bound
away
again
when
captain
eri
caught
him
by
the
arm
i
tell
you
what
he
said
we
scoot
for
eldredge
shanty
and
hide
there
till
she
gits
tired
and
goes
away
she
wo
come
the
deserted
fish
shanty
property
of
the
heirs
of
the
late
nathaniel
eldredge
was
situated
in
a
hollow
close
to
the
house
in
a
few
moments
the
three
were
inside
with
a
sawhorse
against
the
door
then
captain
eri
pantingly
sat
down
on
an
overturned
bucket
and
laughed
until
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
that
it
laff
almost
sobbed
captain
jerry
set
there
and
like
a
bedlamite
it
what
you
might
expect
wait
till
the
rest
of
the
town
finds
out
about
this
they
do
the
laffin
then
and
you
feel
so
funny
we
never
hear
the
last
of
it
in
this
world
if
that
darky
comes
down
here
i
i
drown
her
i
will
i
do
blame
jerry
said
perez
indignantly
i
do
see
much
to
laff
at
oh
my
soul
and
body
there
she
comes
they
heard
the
rattle
of
a
heavy
carriage
and
crowding
together
at
the
cobwebbed
window
saw
the
black
shape
of
the
depot
wagon
rock
past
they
waited
breathless
until
they
saw
it
go
back
again
up
the
road
did
you
lock
the
door
perez
asked
captain
eri
course
i
did
why
should
i
it
was
a
rather
senseless
question
nobody
locks
doors
in
orham
except
at
bedtime
humph
grunted
captain
eri
she
see
the
light
in
the
dining
room
and
go
inside
and
wait
more
likely
well
there
nothin
for
us
to
do
but
to
stay
here
for
a
while
and
then
if
she
ai
gone
one
of
us
have
to
go
up
and
tell
her
she
wo
suit
and
pay
her
fare
home
that
all
i
think
jerry
ought
to
be
the
one
he
added
mischievously
he
bein
the
bridegroom
as
you
might
me
almost
shouted
the
frantic
captain
jerry
you
go
to
grass
you
fellers
got
me
into
this
scrape
and
now
let
see
you
git
me
out
of
it
i
do
stir
one
they
sat
there
in
darkness
the
silence
unbroken
save
for
an
occasional
chuckle
from
the
provoking
eri
perez
however
was
meditating
and
observed
after
a
while
snow
that
a
queer
name
for
a
darky
ai
it
that
colored
man
up
at
barry
place
was
named
white
said
captain
jerry
and
he
was
black
as
your
hat
names
do
they
say
colored
folks
make
good
cooks
jerry
slyly
remarked
eri
maybe
you
better
think
it
the
unlucky
victim
of
chance
did
not
deign
an
answer
and
the
minutes
crept
slowly
by
after
a
long
while
they
heard
someone
whistling
perez
went
to
the
window
to
take
an
observation
it
a
man
he
said
disappointedly
he
been
to
our
house
too
my
land
i
hope
he
did
go
in
it
that
feller
hazeltine
that
who
is
it
exclaimed
eri
eagerly
that
so
so
is
let
give
him
a
before
he
could
be
stopped
he
had
pulled
the
from
the
door
had
opened
the
latter
a
little
way
and
with
his
face
at
the
opening
was
whistling
shrilly
the
electrician
looked
up
and
down
the
dark
road
in
a
puzzled
sort
of
way
but
evidently
could
not
make
up
his
mind
from
what
quarter
the
whistles
came
mr
hazeltine
hailed
the
captain
in
what
might
be
called
a
whispered
yell
or
a
shouted
whisper
mr
hazeltine
here
on
your
lee
bow
in
the
the
word
shanty
was
the
only
part
of
the
speech
that
brought
light
to
ralph
mind
but
that
was
sufficient
he
came
down
the
hill
left
the
road
and
plunged
through
the
blackberry
vines
to
the
door
who
is
it
he
asked
why
hello
captain
what
on
earth
captain
eri
signaled
him
to
silence
and
then
catching
his
arm
pulled
him
into
the
shanty
and
shut
the
door
captain
jerry
hastened
to
set
the
in
place
again
mr
hazeltine
said
captain
eri
let
me
make
you
acquainted
with
perez
and
jerry
shipmates
of
mine
you
heard
me
speak
of
ralph
in
the
darkness
shook
two
big
hands
and
heard
whispered
voices
express
themselves
as
glad
to
know
him
you
see
continued
eri
in
a
somewhat
embarrassed
fashion
we
sort
of
layin
to
as
yer
might
say
waitin
to
git
our
bearin
we
out
of
our
heads
i
tell
you
that
i
know
that
what
it
looks
the
bewildered
hazeltine
laughed
and
said
he
was
glad
to
hear
it
to
tell
the
truth
he
had
begun
to
think
that
something
or
other
had
suddenly
driven
his
nearest
neighbors
crazy
i
i
i
do
know
how
to
explain
it
to
you
the
captain
stumbled
on
fact
is
i
guess
i
wo
jest
yit
if
you
do
mind
it
does
sound
so
pesky
although
it
ai
when
you
understand
it
what
we
want
to
know
is
have
you
been
to
our
house
and
is
there
anybody
there
why
yes
i
been
there
i
rowed
over
and
dropped
in
for
a
minute
as
you
suggested
the
other
day
the
housekeeper
i
suppose
it
was
the
housekeeper
that
opened
the
door
said
you
were
out
and
i
he
was
interrupted
by
a
hopeless
groan
i
knew
it
wailed
captain
jerry
i
knew
it
and
you
said
there
no
danger
eri
hush
up
jerry
a
minute
for
the
love
of
goodness
what
was
she
doin
hazeltine
this
woman
you
thought
was
the
housekeeper
did
she
look
as
if
she
was
gettin
ready
to
go
out
did
she
have
her
bunnit
on
no
she
seemed
to
be
very
much
at
home
that
why
i
thought
but
again
captain
jerry
broke
in
well
by
mighty
he
ejaculated
that
nice
now
ai
it
she
goin
away
you
bet
she
ai
goin
to
stay
there
and
wait
if
it
forever
she
got
too
good
a
thing
jest
as
like
not
busteed
or
some
other
gab
machine
like
her
be
the
next
one
to
call
and
if
they
see
that
great
black
critter
oh
my
soul
black
said
ralph
amazedly
why
the
woman
at
your
house
is
black
she
as
white
as
i
am
and
not
for
a
woman
of
her
what
this
was
the
trio
in
chorus
then
captain
eri
said
mr
hazeltine
now
honest
and
true
is
that
a
fact
of
course
it
a
the
captain
wiped
his
forehead
mr
hazeltine
he
said
if
anybody
had
told
me
a
fort
ago
that
i
was
one
of
the
three
biggest
fools
in
orham
i
have
rared
up
some
as
is
now
i
i
thank
him
for
lettin
me
off
so
easy
you
have
to
excuse
us
afraid
we
in
a
scrape
that
we
got
to
git
out
of
all
alone
i
tell
you
it
some
day
jest
now
wish
you
keep
this
kind
of
quiet
to
oblige
hazeltine
saw
that
this
was
meant
as
a
gentle
hint
for
his
immediate
departure
and
although
he
had
a
fair
share
of
curiosity
felt
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
he
promised
secrecy
promised
faithfully
to
call
again
later
in
the
week
and
then
the
sawhorse
having
been
removed
by
captain
perez
captain
jerry
was
apparently
suffering
from
a
sort
of
dazed
paralysis
he
went
away
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
captain
eri
began
to
lay
down
the
law
now
then
he
said
there
been
some
sort
of
a
mistake
that
plain
enough
more
likely
the
darky
took
the
wrong
satchel
when
she
got
up
to
come
out
of
the
car
that
woman
at
the
house
is
the
real
marthy
snow
all
right
and
we
got
to
go
right
up
there
and
see
her
come
on
but
captain
jerry
mutinied
outright
he
declared
that
the
sight
of
that
darky
had
sickened
him
of
marrying
forever
and
that
he
would
not
see
the
candidate
from
nantucket
nor
any
other
candidate
no
persuasion
could
budge
him
he
simply
would
not
stir
from
that
shanty
until
the
house
had
been
cleared
of
female
visitors
go
and
see
her
yourself
if
you
so
set
on
it
he
declared
i
sha
all
right
said
captain
eri
calmly
i
will
i
tell
her
bashful
but
jest
dyin
to
be
married
and
that
she
can
have
you
if
she
only
waits
long
with
this
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
out
hold
on
eri
shouted
the
frantic
jerry
do
you
do
it
do
you
tell
her
that
land
of
love
perez
do
you
he
will
i
do
know
was
the
answer
in
a
disgusted
tone
you
had
ought
to
have
been
so
captain
eri
with
set
teeth
and
determination
written
on
his
face
walked
straight
to
the
door
drawing
a
long
breath
he
opened
it
and
stepped
inside
a
woman
who
had
been
sitting
in
captain
perez
rocker
rose
as
he
entered
the
woman
looked
at
the
captain
and
the
captain
looked
at
her
she
was
of
middle
age
inclined
to
stoutness
with
a
pair
of
keen
eyes
behind
spectacles
and
was
dressed
in
a
black
alpaca
gown
that
was
faded
a
little
in
places
and
had
been
neatly
mended
in
others
she
spoke
first
you
not
burgess
she
said
no
said
the
captain
uneasily
my
name
is
hedge
i
a
sort
of
messmate
of
his
you
miss
snow
mrs
snow
i
a
they
shook
hands
mrs
snow
calmly
expectant
the
captain
very
nervous
and
not
knowing
how
to
begin
i
feel
as
if
i
knew
you
hedge
said
the
widow
as
the
captain
slid
into
his
own
rocker
the
boy
on
the
depot
wagon
told
me
a
lot
about
you
and
ryder
and
did
hey
the
captain
inwardly
vowed
vengeance
on
his
grandnephew
hope
he
gave
us
a
clean
well
he
did
say
nothin
against
you
if
that
what
you
mean
if
he
had
i
do
think
it
would
have
made
much
i
lived
long
enough
to
want
to
find
out
things
for
myself
and
not
take
the
lady
seeming
to
expect
some
sort
of
answer
to
this
statement
captain
eri
expressed
his
opinion
that
the
plan
of
finding
out
things
for
one
self
was
a
good
then
after
another
fidgety
silence
he
observed
that
it
was
a
fine
evening
there
being
no
dispute
on
this
point
he
endeavored
to
think
of
something
else
to
say
mrs
snow
however
saved
him
the
trouble
hedge
she
said
as
i
here
on
what
you
might
call
a
errand
and
as
i
been
waitin
pretty
nigh
two
hours
already
we
better
talk
about
somethin
besides
fine
evenin
i
got
to
be
lookin
up
a
hotel
or
boardin
house
or
somewheres
to
stay
and
i
ca
wait
much
longer
i
jedge
you
got
my
letter
and
was
me
now
if
it
ai
askin
too
much
i
like
to
know
where
burgess
is
and
why
he
at
the
depot
to
meet
this
was
a
leading
question
and
the
captain
was
more
embarrassed
than
ever
however
he
felt
that
something
had
to
be
done
and
that
it
was
wisest
to
get
it
over
with
as
soon
as
possible
well
he
said
we
we
got
your
letter
all
right
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
we
was
at
the
depot
perez
and
me
and
you
was
well
then
for
the
land
of
goodness
why
did
you
let
me
know
it
such
a
time
as
i
had
tryin
to
find
out
where
you
lived
and
all
the
captain
saw
but
one
plausible
explanation
and
that
was
the
plain
truth
slowly
he
told
the
story
of
the
colored
woman
and
the
extension
case
the
widow
laughed
until
her
spectacles
fell
off
well
there
she
exclaimed
if
that
do
beat
all
i
do
blame
burgess
a
mite
poor
thing
i
guess
i
have
run
too
if
i
have
seen
that
darky
she
was
settin
right
in
the
next
seat
to
me
and
she
had
a
bag
like
mine
and
when
she
got
up
to
git
out
she
took
mine
by
mistake
i
was
a
good
deal
put
out
about
it
and
i
expect
i
talked
to
her
like
a
dutch
uncle
when
i
caught
up
with
her
dear
dear
where
is
burgess
he
shut
up
in
a
fish
shanty
down
the
road
and
he
so
upsot
that
i
dunno
he
stir
from
there
tonight
jerry
ai
prejudiced
but
that
darky
was
too
much
for
and
then
they
both
laughed
the
widow
because
of
the
ludicrous
nature
of
the
affair
and
the
captain
because
of
the
relief
that
the
acceptance
of
it
afforded
his
mind
mrs
snow
was
the
first
to
become
grave
hedge
she
said
there
one
or
two
things
i
must
say
right
here
in
the
first
place
i
ai
in
the
habit
of
answerin
advertisements
from
folks
that
wants
to
git
married
i
ai
so
hard
up
for
a
man
as
all
that
comes
to
next
thing
i
did
come
down
here
with
my
mind
made
up
to
marry
burgess
not
by
no
means
i
wanted
to
see
him
and
talk
with
him
and
tell
him
jest
all
about
how
things
was
with
me
and
find
out
about
him
and
then
why
if
everything
was
shipshape
i
might
think
about
jest
so
jest
so
broke
in
her
companion
that
about
the
way
we
felt
you
see
there
a
long
story
on
both
sides
and
if
you
excuse
me
i
go
down
to
the
shanty
and
see
if
i
ca
git
jerry
up
here
it
be
a
job
i
but
no
you
sha
either
i
tell
you
what
we
do
it
awful
late
now
and
i
must
be
gittin
up
to
the
tavern
if
too
much
trouble
you
walk
up
there
with
me
and
i
stay
there
and
i
come
down
here
and
we
all
have
a
talk
by
that
time
your
friend
have
the
darky
woman
some
off
his
mind
needless
to
say
captain
eri
agreed
to
this
plan
with
alacrity
the
widow
carefully
tied
on
a
black
bonnet
picked
up
a
fat
umbrella
and
the
extension
case
and
said
that
she
was
ready
they
walked
up
the
road
together
the
captain
carrying
the
extension
case
they
talked
but
not
of
matrimonial
prospects
mrs
snow
knew
almost
as
much
about
the
sea
and
the
goings
and
comings
thereon
as
did
her
escort
and
the
conversation
was
salty
in
the
extreme
it
developed
that
the
nantucket
lady
had
a
distant
relative
who
was
in
the
service
at
cuttyhunk
station
and
as
the
captain
knew
every
station
man
for
twenty
miles
up
and
down
the
coast
wrecks
and
maritime
disasters
of
all
kinds
were
discussed
in
detail
at
the
traveler
rest
mrs
snow
was
introduced
by
the
unblushing
eri
as
a
cousin
from
provincetown
and
after
some
controversy
concerning
the
price
of
board
and
lodging
she
was
shown
up
to
her
room
captain
eri
walked
home
absorbed
in
meditation
whatever
his
thoughts
were
they
were
not
disagreeable
for
he
smiled
and
shook
his
head
more
than
once
as
if
with
satisfaction
as
he
passed
john
baxter
house
he
noticed
that
the
light
in
the
upper
window
was
still
burning
captain
perez
was
half
asleep
when
eri
opened
the
door
of
the
shanty
captain
jerry
however
was
very
much
awake
and
demanded
to
be
told
things
right
away
his
friend
briefly
explained
the
situation
i
do
care
if
she
stays
here
till
doomsday
emphatically
declared
the
disgruntled
one
i
sha
marry
her
what
she
like
anyhow
he
was
surprised
at
the
enthusiasm
of
captain
eri
answer
she
a
mighty
good
woman
that
what
i
think
she
is
and
she
make
a
wife
for
any
man
i
hope
you
say
so
too
when
you
see
her
there
ai
nothin
about
her
but
she
got
more
than
any
woman
i
ever
saw
but
there
i
sha
talk
another
bit
about
her
come
on
home
and
turn
and
go
home
and
turn
in
they
did
but
not
without
protestation
from
the
pair
who
had
yet
to
meet
the
woman
from
nantucket
chapter
vi
the
schoolhouse
bell
rings
all
hands
on
deck
turn
out
there
turnout
captain
eri
grunted
and
rolled
over
in
his
bed
for
a
moment
or
two
he
fancied
himself
back
in
the
of
the
sea
mist
the
bark
in
which
he
had
made
his
first
voyage
then
as
he
grew
wider
awake
he
heard
somewhere
in
the
distance
a
bell
ringing
furiously
turn
out
all
hands
turn
out
captain
eri
sat
up
that
voice
was
no
part
of
a
dream
it
belonged
to
captain
jerry
and
the
tone
of
it
meant
business
the
bell
continued
to
ring
aye
aye
jerry
what
the
matter
he
shouted
fire
there
a
big
fire
up
in
the
village
look
out
of
the
window
and
you
can
see
they
ringing
the
schoolhouse
bell
do
you
hear
it
the
captain
wide
awake
enough
by
this
time
jumped
out
of
bed
carrying
the
blankets
with
him
and
ran
to
the
window
opening
it
he
thrust
out
his
head
the
wind
had
changed
to
the
eastward
and
a
thick
fog
had
come
in
with
it
the
house
was
surrounded
by
a
wet
black
wall
but
off
to
the
west
a
red
glow
shone
through
it
now
brighter
and
now
fainter
the
schoolhouse
bell
was
turning
somersaults
in
its
excitement
only
once
since
captain
jerry
had
been
janitor
had
the
schoolhouse
bell
been
rung
except
in
the
performance
of
its
regular
duties
that
once
was
on
a
night
before
the
fourth
of
july
when
some
mischievous
youngsters
climbed
in
at
a
window
and
proclaimed
to
sleeping
orham
that
young
america
was
celebrating
the
anniversary
of
its
birth
since
then
on
nights
before
the
fourth
captain
jerry
had
slept
in
the
schoolhouse
armed
with
a
horsewhip
and
an
ancient
navy
revolver
the
revolver
was
strictly
for
show
and
the
horsewhip
for
use
but
neither
was
called
into
service
for
even
if
some
spirits
did
venture
near
the
building
the
captain
snores
as
he
slumbered
by
the
front
door
were
danger
signals
that
could
not
be
disregarded
but
there
was
no
flavor
of
the
fourth
in
the
bell
note
this
night
whoever
the
ringer
might
be
he
was
ringing
as
though
it
was
his
only
hope
for
life
and
the
bell
swung
back
and
forth
without
a
pause
the
red
glow
in
the
fog
brightened
again
as
the
captain
gazed
at
it
captain
jerry
came
tumbling
up
the
stairs
breathless
and
half
dressed
where
do
you
make
it
out
to
be
he
panted
somewhere
nigh
the
looks
if
it
might
be
store
where
perez
captain
eri
had
lighted
a
lamp
and
was
pulling
on
his
boots
as
he
spoke
here
i
be
shouted
the
missing
member
of
the
trio
from
the
dining
room
below
i
all
ready
hurry
up
eri
captain
eri
jumped
into
his
trousers
slipped
into
a
faded
and
clattered
downstairs
followed
by
the
wildly
excited
jerry
good
land
perez
he
cried
as
he
came
into
the
dining
room
i
thought
you
said
you
was
all
ready
captain
perez
paused
in
the
vain
attempt
to
make
captain
jerry
hat
cover
his
own
cranium
and
replied
indignantly
well
i
am
ai
i
seems
to
me
i
put
somethin
on
my
feet
besides
them
socks
if
i
was
you
you
might
catch
perez
glanced
down
at
his
extremities
in
blank
astonishment
well
now
he
exclaimed
if
i
hai
forgot
my
boots
well
git
on
and
be
quick
there
your
hat
give
jerry
the
excited
perez
vanished
through
the
door
of
his
chamber
and
captain
eri
glanced
at
the
chronometer
the
time
was
a
quarter
after
two
they
hurried
out
of
the
door
and
through
the
yard
the
wind
as
has
been
said
was
from
the
east
but
there
was
little
of
it
and
except
for
the
clanging
of
the
bell
the
night
was
very
still
the
fog
was
heavy
and
wet
and
the
trees
and
bushes
dripped
as
if
from
a
shower
there
was
the
salt
smell
of
the
marshes
in
the
air
and
the
hissing
and
splashing
of
the
surf
on
the
outer
beach
were
plainly
to
be
heard
also
there
was
the
clicking
sound
of
oars
in
somebody
is
comin
over
from
the
station
gasped
captain
jerry
run
so
eri
it
too
dark
i
pretty
nigh
broke
my
neck
they
passed
the
lily
pond
where
the
frogs
had
long
since
adjourned
their
concert
and
gone
to
bed
dodged
through
the
yard
of
the
tightly
shuttered
summer
hotel
and
came
out
at
the
corner
of
the
road
having
saved
some
distance
by
the
that
ai
weeks
store
declared
captain
perez
who
was
in
the
lead
it
web
saunders
place
that
what
it
captain
eri
paused
and
looked
over
to
the
left
in
the
direction
of
the
baxter
homestead
the
light
in
the
window
was
still
burning
they
turned
into
the
main
road
at
a
dog
trot
and
became
part
of
a
crowd
of
oddly
dressed
people
all
running
in
the
same
direction
web
place
ai
it
asked
eri
of
seth
wingate
who
was
lumbering
along
with
a
wooden
bucket
in
one
hand
and
the
pitcher
of
his
best
washstand
set
in
the
other
yes
breathlessly
answered
wingate
and
it
a
goner
they
tell
me
every
man
got
to
do
his
part
if
they
going
to
save
it
i
allers
said
we
ought
to
have
a
fire
department
in
this
considering
that
seth
had
for
the
past
eight
years
persistently
opposed
in
any
attempt
to
purchase
a
hand
engine
this
was
a
rather
surprising
speech
but
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
it
then
the
fire
was
in
the
billiard
saloon
sure
enough
and
the
back
portion
of
the
building
was
in
a
blaze
when
they
reached
it
ladders
were
placed
against
the
eaves
and
a
line
of
men
with
buckets
were
pouring
water
on
the
roof
the
line
extended
to
the
town
pump
where
two
energetic
youths
in
their
shirtsleeves
were
working
the
handle
with
might
and
main
the
houses
near
at
hand
were
brilliantly
illuminated
and
men
and
women
were
bringing
water
from
them
in
buckets
tin
pails
washboilers
and
even
coalscuttles
inside
the
saloon
another
hustling
crowd
was
busily
working
to
save
saunders
property
a
dozen
of
the
members
had
turned
the
biggest
pool
table
over
on
its
back
and
were
unscrewing
the
legs
heedless
of
the
fact
that
to
attempt
to
get
the
table
through
the
front
door
was
an
impossibility
and
that
as
the
back
door
was
in
the
thickest
of
the
fire
it
too
was
out
of
the
question
a
man
appeared
at
the
open
front
window
of
the
second
story
with
his
arms
filled
with
bottles
of
various
liquids
original
packages
and
others
these
with
feverish
energy
he
threw
one
by
one
into
the
street
endangering
the
lives
of
everyone
in
range
and
of
course
breaking
every
bottle
thrown
some
one
of
the
cooler
heads
calling
his
attention
to
these
facts
he
retired
and
carefully
packed
all
the
empty
bottles
the
only
ones
remaining
into
a
peach
basket
and
tugged
the
latter
downstairs
and
to
a
safe
place
on
a
neighboring
piazza
then
he
rested
from
his
labors
as
one
who
had
done
all
that
might
reasonably
be
expected
saunders
himself
lightly
attired
in
a
nightshirt
tucked
into
a
pair
of
trousers
was
rushing
here
and
there
now
loudly
demanding
more
water
and
then
stopping
to
swear
at
the
or
some
other
enthusiast
web
smoothness
was
all
gone
and
the
language
he
used
was
as
abigail
mullett
said
afterward
enough
to
bring
down
a
jedgment
on
captain
eri
caught
him
by
the
sleeve
as
he
was
running
past
and
inquired
how
it
start
web
how
it
start
i
know
mighty
well
how
it
started
and
i
git
through
i
know
who
started
it
somebody
pay
for
this
now
you
hear
me
hurry
up
with
the
water
you
he
tore
frantically
away
to
the
pump
and
the
three
captains
joined
the
crowd
of
volunteer
firemen
captain
eri
running
round
to
the
back
of
the
building
took
in
the
situation
at
once
back
of
the
main
portion
of
the
saloon
was
an
ell
and
it
was
in
this
ell
that
the
fire
had
started
the
ell
itself
was
in
a
bright
blaze
but
the
larger
building
in
front
was
only
just
beginning
to
burn
the
captain
climbed
one
of
the
ladders
to
the
roof
and
called
to
the
men
at
work
there
that
shed
gone
ben
he
said
chuck
your
water
on
the
main
part
here
maybe
if
we
had
some
ropes
we
might
be
able
to
pull
the
shed
clear
and
then
we
could
save
the
how
you
fasten
the
ropes
was
the
panted
reply
she
all
ablaze
and
a
rope
would
burn
through
in
a
minute
if
you
tied
it
git
some
grapples
and
anchors
out
of
rogers
shop
he
got
a
whole
lot
of
keep
on
with
the
water
i
git
the
other
he
descended
the
ladder
and
explained
his
idea
to
the
crowd
below
there
was
a
great
shout
and
twenty
men
and
boys
started
on
a
run
after
ropes
while
as
many
more
stormed
at
the
door
of
nathaniel
rogers
blacksmith
shop
rogers
was
the
local
dealer
in
anchors
and
other
marine
ironwork
the
door
of
the
shop
was
locked
and
there
was
a
yell
for
axes
to
burst
it
open
then
arose
an
agonized
shriek
of
do
chop
do
chop
and
rogers
himself
came
struggling
to
the
defense
of
his
property
in
concert
the
instant
need
was
explained
to
him
but
he
remained
unconvinced
we
ca
stay
here
arguin
all
night
roared
one
of
the
leaders
got
to
let
us
in
go
ahead
and
chop
i
hold
i
give
you
fair
warnin
squealer
wixon
if
you
chop
that
door
have
the
law
onto
you
i
just
had
that
door
painted
and
stop
i
got
the
key
in
my
pocket
it
was
plain
that
the
majority
were
still
in
favor
of
chopping
as
affording
a
better
outlet
for
surplus
energy
but
they
waited
while
rogers
still
protesting
produced
the
key
and
unlocked
the
door
in
another
minute
the
greater
portion
of
the
ironwork
in
the
establishment
was
on
its
way
to
the
fire
the
were
just
returning
laden
with
everything
from
to
cables
half
a
dozen
boat
anchors
and
a
grapnel
were
fastened
to
as
many
ropes
and
the
crowd
pranced
gayly
about
the
burning
ell
looking
for
a
chance
to
make
them
fast
captain
eri
found
a
party
with
axes
endeavoring
to
cut
a
hole
through
the
side
of
the
saloon
in
order
to
get
out
the
pool
table
after
some
endeavor
he
persuaded
them
to
desist
and
they
came
around
to
the
rear
and
taking
turns
ran
in
close
to
the
shed
and
chopped
at
it
until
the
fire
drove
them
away
at
last
they
made
a
hole
close
to
where
it
joined
the
main
building
large
enough
to
attach
the
grapnel
then
with
a
yo
heave
ho
everyone
took
hold
of
the
rope
and
pulled
of
course
the
grapnel
pulled
out
with
only
a
board
or
two
but
they
tried
again
and
this
time
getting
it
around
a
beam
pulled
a
large
portion
of
the
shed
to
the
ground
meanwhile
another
ax
party
had
attached
an
anchor
to
the
opposite
side
and
were
making
good
progress
in
due
time
the
shed
yawned
away
from
the
saloon
tottered
and
collapsed
in
a
shower
of
sparks
a
deluge
of
water
soon
extinguished
these
then
everyone
turned
to
the
main
building
and
as
the
fire
had
not
yet
taken
a
firm
hold
of
this
they
soon
had
it
under
control
captain
eri
worked
with
the
rest
until
he
saw
that
the
worst
was
over
then
he
began
the
search
that
had
been
in
his
mind
since
he
first
saw
the
blaze
he
found
captain
jerry
and
captain
perez
perspiringly
passing
buckets
of
water
from
hand
to
hand
in
the
line
and
calling
them
to
one
side
asked
anxiously
have
either
of
you
fellers
seen
john
baxter
tonight
captain
perez
looked
surprised
and
then
some
of
the
trouble
discernible
in
eri
face
was
apparent
in
his
own
why
no
he
replied
slowly
i
ai
seen
him
now
you
speak
of
it
everybody
in
town
here
too
queer
ai
it
have
you
seen
him
either
jerry
captain
jerry
answered
with
a
shake
of
the
head
but
then
he
said
perez
and
me
have
been
right
here
by
the
pump
ever
sence
we
come
he
might
be
anywheres
else
and
we
would
see
him
want
me
to
ask
some
of
the
other
fellers
no
exclaimed
his
friend
almost
fiercely
do
you
mention
his
name
to
a
soul
nor
let
know
you
thought
of
him
if
anybody
should
ask
tell
you
guess
he
right
around
somewheres
you
two
git
to
work
i
let
you
know
if
i
want
the
pair
took
up
their
buckets
and
the
captain
walked
on
from
group
to
group
looking
carefully
at
each
person
the
reverend
perley
and
some
of
his
flock
were
standing
by
themselves
on
a
neighboring
stoop
and
to
them
the
searcher
turned
eagerly
why
eri
exclaimed
miss
busteed
the
first
to
identify
him
how
you
worked
you
must
be
tired
pretty
nigh
to
death
ai
it
awful
but
it
the
lord
doin
i
jest
as
sure
of
that
as
i
can
be
and
i
says
so
to
perley
did
i
perley
i
says
lookin
for
anybody
interrupted
the
reverend
gentleman
no
lied
the
captain
calmly
jest
walkin
around
to
git
cooled
off
a
little
there
was
the
most
likely
place
and
john
baxter
was
not
there
certainly
every
citizen
in
orham
who
was
able
to
crawl
would
be
out
this
night
and
if
the
old
puritan
hermit
of
the
big
house
was
not
present
to
exult
over
the
downfall
of
the
wicked
it
would
be
because
he
was
ill
or
because
the
captain
did
like
to
think
of
the
other
reason
web
saunders
quietly
weeping
was
seated
on
a
knoll
near
the
pump
three
of
the
saunders
hopefuls
also
weeping
but
not
quietly
were
seated
beside
her
another
the
youngest
of
the
family
was
being
rocked
soothingly
in
the
arms
of
a
stout
female
who
was
singing
to
it
as
placidly
as
though
fires
were
an
every
day
or
night
occurrence
the
captain
peered
down
and
the
stout
woman
looked
up
why
mrs
snow
exclaimed
captain
eri
the
lady
from
nantucket
made
no
immediate
reply
she
rose
however
shook
down
the
black
alpaca
skirt
which
had
been
folded
up
to
keep
it
out
of
the
dew
and
still
humming
softly
to
the
child
walked
off
a
little
way
motioning
with
her
head
for
the
captain
to
follow
when
she
had
reached
a
spot
sufficiently
remote
from
saunders
she
whispered
how
d
do
hedge
i
guess
the
wust
is
over
now
is
it
i
saw
you
workin
with
them
ropes
you
must
be
awful
how
long
have
you
been
here
asked
the
captain
somewhat
astonished
at
her
calmness
oh
i
come
right
down
as
soon
as
i
heard
the
bell
i
kind
of
used
to
fires
my
husband
schooner
got
afire
twice
while
i
was
with
him
he
used
to
run
a
coal
vessel
you

i
got
right
up
and
packed
my
bag
i
did
know
how
the
fire
might
spread
you
never
can
tell
in
a
town
like
this
dearie
to
the
baby
there
there
it
all
right
lay
how
you
git
acquainted
with
her
nodding
toward
the
wife
of
the
proprietor
of
the
scorched
saloon
oh
i
see
the
poor
thing
settin
there
with
all
them
children
and
nobody
paying
much
attention
to
her
so
i
went
over
and
asked
if
i
could
help

but
i
was

she
spoke
to
him
and
he
swore
at
her
somethin

cryin
poor
critter
i
guess
by
the
looks
she
used
to
it
well
i
give
him
a
piece
of
my
mind
he
went
away
with
a
flea
in
his
ear
i
do
despise
a
profane
man
above
all
things
yes
the
all
right
saunders

i

in
the

to
be
careful
and
not
stand
still
much
this
damp
night
it
bad
when
you
het
up
she
went
back
still
singing
to
the
baby
to
where
saunders
sat
and
the
captain
looked
after
her
in
a
kind
of
amazed
fashion
by
mighty
he
muttered
and
then
repeated
it
then
he
resumed
his
search
he
remembered
that
there
had
been
a
number
of
people
on
the
side
of
the
burning
shed
opposite
that
on
which
he
had
been
employed
and
he
determined
to
have
one
look
there
before
going
to
the
baxter
homestead
almost
the
first
man
he
saw
as
he
approached
the
dying
fire
was
ralph
hazeltine
the
electrician
hands
and
face
were
blackened
by
soot
and
the
perspiration
sparkled
on
his
forehead
hello
captain
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
lively
for
a
while
was
it
they
tell
me
you
were
the
man
who
suggested
pulling
down
the
shed
it
saved
the
day
all
right
you
look
as
if
you
been
workin
some
yourself
was
you
one
of
the
fellers
that
got
that
anchor
in
on
this
side
he
was
the
one
broke
in
wingate
who
was
standing
at
elbow
he
waded
in
with
an
ax
and
stayed
there
till
i
thought
he
burn
the
hair
off
his
head
web

to
pay
you
and
him
salvage
eri
the
whole
craft
would
have
gone
up
if

ralph

a
while
longer
then
see
you
later
the
fog
had
lifted
somewhat
and
as
the
captain
running
silently
turned
into
the
shore
road
he
saw
that
the
light
in
the
baxter
homestead
had
not
been
extinguished
the
schoolhouse
bell
had
ceased
to
ring
and
the
shouts
of
the
crowd
at
the
fire
sounded
faintly
there
were
no
other
sounds
up
the
driveway
captain
eri
hurried
there
were
no
lights
in
the
lower
part
of
the
house
and
the
door
was
locked
the
kitchen
door
however
was
not
fastened
and
the
captain
opened
it
and
entered
shutting
it
carefully
behind
him
he
groped
along
to
the
entrance
of
the
next
room
john
he
called
softly
there
was
no
answer
and
the
house
was
perfectly
still
save
for
the
ticking
of
the
big
clock
captain
eri
scratched
a
match
and
by
its
light
climbed
the
stairs
his
room
was
empty
the
lamp
was
burning
on
the
bureau
and
a
bible
was
open
beside
it
the
bed
had
not
been
slept
in
thoroughly
alarmed
now
the
captain
lamp
in
hand
went
through
one
room
after
the
other
john
baxter
was
not
at
home
and
he
was
not
with
the
crowd
at
the
fire
where
was
he
there
was
of
course
a
chance
that
his
friend
had
passed
him
on
the
way
or
that
he
had
been
at
the
fire
after
all
but
this
did
not
seem
possible
however
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
go
back
and
this
time
the
captain
took
the
path
across
the
fields
the
baxter
house
was
on
the
shore
road
and
the
billiard
room
and
were
on
the
main
people
in
a
hurry
sometimes
avoided
the
corner
by
climbing
the
fence
opposite
the
baxter
gate
going
through
the
dawes
pasture
and
over
the
little
hill
back
of
the
livery
stable
and
coming
out
in
the
rear
of
the
and
close
to
the
saloon
captain
eri
worried
afraid
to
think
of
the
fire
and
its
cause
and
only
anxious
to
ascertain
where
his
friend
was
and
what
he
had
been
doing
that
night
trotted
through
the
pasture
and
over
the
hill
just
as
he
came
to
the
bayberry
bushes
on
the
other
side
he
stumbled
and
fell
flat
he
knew
what
it
was
that
he
had
stumbled
over
the
moment
that
he
fell
across
it
and
his
fingers
trembled
so
that
he
could
scarcely
scratch
the
match
that
he
took
from
his
pocket
but
it
was
lighted
at
last
and
as
its
tiny
blaze
grew
brighter
the
captain
saw
john
baxter
lying
face
downward
in
the
path
his
head
pointed
toward
his
home
and
his
feet
toward
the
billiard
saloon
chapter
vii
captain
eri
finds
a
nurse
for
a
second
only
captain
eri
stood
there
motionless
stooping
over
the
body
of
his
friend
then
he
sprang
into
vigorous
action
he
dropped
upon
his
knees
and
seizing
the
shoulder
of
the
prostrate
figure
shook
it
gently
whispering
john
john
there
was
no
answer
and
no
responsive
movement
and
the
captain
bent
his
head
and
listened
breath
was
there
and
life
but
oh
so
little
of
either
the
next
thought
was
of
course
to
run
for
help
and
for
a
doctor
but
he
took
but
a
few
steps
when
a
new
idea
struck
him
and
he
came
back
lighting
another
match
he
examined
the
fallen
man
hurriedly
the
old
lay
in
the
path
with
his
arms
outstretched
as
if
he
had
fallen
while
running
he
was
and
there
was
no
sign
of
a
wound
upon
him
one
was
badly
scorched
and
from
a
pocket
in
the
coat
protruded
the
neck
of
a
bottle
the
bottle
was
empty
but
its
odor
was
strong
it
had
contained
kerosene
the
evidence
was
clear
and
the
captain
knew
that
what
he
had
feared
was
the
truth
for
a
moment
he
stood
erect
and
pondered
as
to
what
was
best
to
do
whatever
it
was
it
must
be
done
quickly
but
if
the
doctor
and
those
that
might
come
with
him
should
find
the
burned
coat
and
the
bottle
it
were
better
for
john
baxter
that
consciousness
and
life
never
were
his
again
there
might
and
probably
would
be
suspicion
but
here
was
proof
absolute
that
meant
prison
and
disgrace
for
a
man
whom
all
the
community
had
honored
and
respected
captain
eri
weighed
the
chances
speculated
on
the
result
and
then
did
what
seemed
to
him
right
he
threw
the
bottle
as
far
away
from
the
path
as
he
could
and
then
stripped
off
the
coat
and
folding
it
into
a
small
bundle
hid
it
in
the
bushes
near
by
then
he
lifted
the
limp
body
and
turned
it
so
that
the
gray
head
was
toward
the
billiard
saloon
instead
of
from
it
perez
and
jerry
were
still
busy
with
the
water
buckets
when
their
friend
came
panting
up
the
knoll
to
the
pump
hello
eri
said
the
former
wiping
his
forehead
with
his
arm
out
ai
it
why

the
matter

speak
of

down
them
buckets
and
you

jerry
come
with
me
i
got
somethin
that
i
want
you
to
nodding
and
exchanging
congratulations
with
acquaintances
in
the
crowd
on
the
success
of
the
captain
eri
led
his
messmates
to
a
dark
corner
under
a
clump
of
trees
then
he
took
each
of
them
by
the
arm
and
whispered
sharply
dr
palmer
somewheres
in
this
crowd
i
want
each
of
you
fellers
to
go
ways
and
look
for

soul

life

advantages

teaches
prompt
obedience
for
one
thing
the
two
mariners
did
not
hesitate
an
instant
but
bolted
in
opposite
directions
captain
eri
watched
them
go
and
then
set
off
in
another
he
was
stopped
every
few
moments
and
all
sorts
of
questions
and
comments
concerning
the
fire
and
its
cause
were
fired
at
him
but
he
put
off
some
inquiries
with
a
curt
do
know
and
others
with
nods
or
negatives
and
threaded
his
way
from
one
clump
of
townspeople
to
another
as
he
came
close
to
the
blackened
and
smoking
billiard
saloon
ralph
hazeltine
caught
him

arm

said

corner
by

to

who

practiced

in
orham
since
he
received
his
diploma
waiting
for
them
captain
perez
who
had
discovered
the
physician
on
the
nickerson
piazza
was
standing
close
by
with
his
fingers
in
his
mouth
whistling
with
the
regularity
of
a
foghorn
cut
it
short
perez
commanded
eri
we
here
yes
but
jerry
and
the
whistling
began
again
dry
up
for
the
land
sake
want
to
fetch
the
whole
tribe
here
there
jerry
now
come
on
john
baxter
was
lying
just
as
the
captain
had
left
him
and
the
others
watched
anxiously
as
the
doctor
listened
at
the
parted
lips
and
thrust
his
hand
inside
the
faded
blue
waistcoat
he
alive
he
said
after
a
moment
but
unconscious
we
must
get
him
home
at
he
heard
the
bell
and
was
runnin
to
the
fire
when
he
was
took
said
captain
jerry
run
out
in
his
shirt
sleeves
and
was
took
when

as
fur
as
that
the
way
i
figger
it
said
eri
unblushingly
lift
him
carefully
you
fellers
now
then
i
warned
him
against
or
excitement
months
ago
said
the
doctor
as
they
bore
the
senseless
burden
toward
the
big
house
now
as
black
as
the
grave
that
was
so
near
its
owner
we
must
find
someone
to
take
care
of
him
at
once
i
do
believe
the
old
man
has
a
relation
within
a
hundred
why
do
we
take
him
to
our
house
suggested
captain
jerry
seem
so
plaguey
lonesome
by
mighty
ejaculated
captain
eri
in
astonishment
well
jerry
be
switched
if
you
ai
right
down
brilliant
once
in
a
while
of
course
we
will
he
can
have
the
spare
room
why
did
i
think
of
that
i
wonder
and
so
john
baxter
who
had
not
paid
a
visit
in
his
native
village
since
his
wife
died
came
at
last
to
his
friend
home
to
pay
what
seemed
likely
to
be
a
final
one
they
carried
him
up
the
stairs
to
the
spare
room
as
dismal
and
cheerless
as
spare
rooms
in
the
country
generally
are
undressed
him
as
tenderly
as
their
rough
hands
would
allow
robed
him
in
one
of
captain
jerry
nightshirts
the
buttons
that
fastened
it
had
been
sewed
on
by
the
captain
himself
and
were
all
sizes
and
colors
and
laid
him
in
the
big
corded
bedstead
the
doctor
hastened
away
to
procure
his
medicine
case
ralph
hazeltine
having
been
profusely
thanked
for
his
services
and
promising
to
call
the
next
day
went
back
to
the
station
and
the
three
captains
sat
down
by
the
bedside
to
watch
and
wait
captain
eri
was
too
much
perturbed
to
talk
but
the
other
two
although
sympathetically
sorry
for
the
sufferer
were
bursting
with
excitement
and
curiosity
well
if
this
ai
been
a
night
exclaimed
captain
jerry
seem
if
everything
happened
at
once
fust
that
darky
and
then
the
fire
and
then
this
do
it
beat
all
eri
said
captain
perez
anxiously
was
john
layin
jest
the
same
way
when
you
found
him
as
he
was
when
we
come
right
in
the
same
place
was
the
answer
i
did
say
in
the
same
place
i
asked
if
he
was
layin
the
same
he
had
moved
a
muscle
laid
jest
as
if
he
was
it
will
be
noticed
that
captain
eri
was
adhering
strictly
to
the
truth
luckily
perez
seemed
to
be
satisfied
for
he
asked
no
further
questions
but
observed
it
a
good
thing
we
got
a
crowd
to
swear
how
we
found
him
there
a
heap
of
folks
in
this
town
would
be
he
set
that
fire
if
for
some
of
will
be
sayin
it
anyhow
remarked
jerry
some
folks
say
anything
but
their
prayers
snapped
eri
savagely
they
wo
say
it
while
i
around
and
look
here
if
you
hear
anybody
sayin
it
you
tell
it
a
lie
if
that
do
keep
quiet
let
me
oh
all
right
we
know
he
did
set
it
i
was
jest
sayin
well
do
say
my
you
techy
guess
fires
and
colored
folks
do
agree
with
you
what
are
we
goin
to
do
now
if
john
do
die
and
the
lord
knows
i
hope
he
wo
he
likely
to
be
sick
here
a
long
spell
who
are
we
goin
to
git
to
take
care
of
him
that
what
i
want
to
know
got
to
do
it
and
we
ai
fit
if
jerry
only
give
in
and
git
married
now
but
captain
jerry
protest
against
matrimony
was
as
obstinate
as
ever
even
perez
gave
up
urging
after
a
while
and
conversation
lagged
again
in
a
few
minutes
the
doctor
came
back
and
his
examination
of
the
patient
and
demands
for
glasses
of
water
teaspoons
and
the
like
kept
perez
and
jerry
busy
it
was
some
time
before
they
noticed
that
captain
eri
had
disappeared
even
then
they
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
the
circumstance
but
watched
the
physician
at
work
and
questioned
him
concerning
the
nature
of
their
guest
illness
think
he
die
doctor
inquired
jerry
in
a
hushed
voice
as
they
came
out
of
the
sick
room
into
the
connecting
chamber
ca
say
he
has
had
a
stroke
of
paralysis
and
there
seem
to
be
other
complications
if
he
regains
consciousness
i
shall
think
he
has
a
chance
but
not
a
very
good
one
his
pulse
is
a
little
stronger
i
think
he
die
but
if
he
lives
he
will
need
a
good
nurse
and
i
do
know
of
one
in
nor
me
neither
said
captain
perez
well
zuby
might
come
suggested
jerry
but
i
should
hate
to
have
her
nuss
me
and
as
for
bein
well
in
a
house
where
she
was
whew
zuby
sneered
his
messmate
if
lorenzo
had
a
fit
and
they
called
zuby
he
have
another
one
and
die
zuby
i
as
soon
have
and
be
done
with
yes
i
do
doubt
you
would
was
the
anything
but
gentle
retort
what
perez
would
have
said
to
this
thrust
must
be
surmised
for
just
then
the
door
opened
and
closed
again
there
eri
said
captain
jerry
then
he
added
in
an
alarmed
whisper
who
on
airth
has
he
got
with
him
they
heard
their
friend
voice
warning
someone
to
be
careful
of
the
top
step
and
then
the
chamber
door
opened
and
captain
eri
appeared
there
were
beads
of
perspiration
on
his
forehead
and
he
was
carrying
a
shabby
canvas
captain
jerry
gazed
at
the
with
bulging
eyes
captain
eri
put
down
the
and
opened
the
door
wide
a
woman
came
in
a
stout
woman
dressed
in
black
alpaca
and
wearing
spectacles
captain
jerry
gasped
audibly
dr
palmer
said
captain
eri
let
me
make
you
acquainted
with
mrs
snow
of
nantucket
mrs
snow
this
is
the
doctor
and
the
lady
from
nantucket
shook
hands
the
former
with
a
puzzled
expression
on
his
face
perez
continued
the
captain
let
me
make
you
known
to
mrs
snow
marthy
snow
this
with
especial
emphasis
of
nantucket
mrs
snow
this
is
perez
they
shook
hands
captain
perez
managed
to
say
that
he
was
glad
to
meet
mrs
snow
captain
jerry
said
nothing
but
he
looked
like
a
criminal
awaiting
the
fall
of
the
drop
doctor
continued
the
captain
paying
no
attention
to
the
signals
of
distress
displayed
by
his
friend
i
heard
you
say
a
spell
ago
that
john
here
needed
somebody
to
take
care
of
him
well
mrs
snow
a
a
sort
of
relation
of
jerry
just
a
suspicion
of
a
smile
accompanied
this
assertion
and
she
done
nussin
in
her
time
i
been
talkin
the
thing
over
with
her
and
she
willin
to
look
out
for
john
till
he
gits
the
physician
adjusted
his
eyeglasses
and
looked
the
volunteer
nurse
over
keenly
the
lady
paid
no
attention
to
the
scrutiny
but
calmly
removed
her
bonnet
and
placed
it
on
the
bureau
the
room
was
captain
eri
and
the
general
disarrangement
of
everything
movable
was
only
a
little
less
marked
than
in
those
of
his
companions
mrs
snow
glanced
over
the
heap
of
odds
and
ends
on
the
bureau
and
picked
up
a
comb
there
were
some
teeth
in
it
but
they
were
distant
neighbors
i
do
use
that
comb
very
much
said
captain
eri
rather
apologetically
i
use
the
one
the
relative
of
captain
jerry
said
nothing
but
laying
down
the
ruin
marched
over
to
the
opened
it
and
took
out
another
comb
a
whole
one
with
this
she
arranged
the
hair
on
her
forehead
it
the
hair
was
parted
in
the
middle
and
drawn
back
smoothly
at
the
sides
and
captain
eri
noticed
that
it
was
brown
with
a
little
gray
in
it
when
the
last
stray
wisp
was
in
place
she
turned
calmly
to
the
doctor
and
said
baxter
in
here
i
shall
i
walk
right
in
the
man
of
medicine
seemed
a
little
surprised
at
the
lady
command
of
the
situation
but
he
said
why
yes
i
guess
you
may
you
have
nursed
before
i
think
the
captain
five
years
with
my
husband
he
had
slow
consumption
before
that
with
my
mother
and
most
of
my
brothers
and
sisters
at
one
time
or
another
i
seen
sickness
all
my
life
more
of
that
than
anything
else
i
guess
now
if
you
come
in
with
me
so
to
tell
me
about
the
medicine
and
so
with
a
short
humph
the
physician
followed
her
into
the
sick
room
while
the
three
mariners
gazed
in
at
the
door
they
watched
as
doctor
palmer
explained
medicines
and
gave
directions
it
did
not
need
an
expert
to
see
that
the
new
nurse
understood
her
business
when
the
doctor
came
out
his
face
shone
with
gratification
she
do
he
said
emphatically
if
all
your
relatives
are
like
that
burgess
i
like
to
know
help
me
in
my
then
he
added
in
response
to
a
question
he
seems
to
be
a
little
better
just
now
i
think
there
will
be
no
change
for
a
while
if
there
should
be
send
for
me
i
call
in
the
morning
gracious
it
almost
daylight
they
saw
him
to
the
door
and
then
came
back
upstairs
mrs
snow
was
busy
arranging
the
pillows
setting
the
room
in
something
like
order
and
caring
for
her
patient
garments
that
had
been
tossed
on
the
floor
in
the
hurry
of
undressing
she
came
to
the
door
as
they
entered
captain
eri
chamber
mrs
snow
said
the
captain
you
better
sleep
in
my
room
here
long
you
stay
i
bunk
in
with
perez
downstairs
i
git
my
dunnage
out
of

right
off
i
think
likely
you
want
to
clean
up
the
lady
from
nantucket
glanced
at
the
bureau
top
and
seemed
about
to
say
something
but
checked
herself
what
she
did
say
was
you
better
introduce
me
to
burgess
i
do
think
ever
met
if
we
are
captain
eri
actually
blushed
a
little
why
of
course
he
said
excuse
me
jerry
this
is
mrs
snow
i
do
know
what
got
into
me
bein
so
the
sacrifice
shook
the
nurse
hand
and
said
something
nobody
knew
exactly
what
mrs
snow
went
on
to
say
now
i
want
you
men
to
go
right
on
to
bed
for
i
know
you
all
tuckered
out
we
can
talk
i
mean
of
course
i
forgot
was
to
daylight
now
i
shall
set
up
with
baxter
and
if
i
need
you
i
call
you
call
you
anyway
when
i
think
it
time
they
protested
of
course
but
the
lady
would
not
listen
she
calmly
seated
herself
in
the
rocker
by
the
bed
and
waved
to
them
to
go
which
two
of
them
reluctantly
did
after
a
while
the
other
one
had
gone
already
it
would
be
superfluous
to
mention
his
name
downstairs
again
and
in
perez
room
captain
eri
came
in
for
a
questioning
that
bade
fair
to
keep
up
forever
he
shut
off
all
inquiries
however
with
the
announcement
that
he
would
tell
them
a
word
about
it
till
he
had
some
sleep
then
he
would
explain
the
whole
thing
and
they
could
decide
whether
he
had
done
right
or
not
there
were
all
sorts
of
things
to
be
considered
he
said
and
they
had
better
take
a
nap
now
while
they
could
well
i
jest
like
to
ask
you
this
eri
hedge
demanded
captain
jerry
what
in
time
did
you
tell
the
doctor
that
she
was
a
relation
of
mine
for
that
was
a
nice
thing
to
do
it
i
have
to
answer
more
fool
questions
that
than
a
little
what
sort
of
a
relation
shall
i
tell
folks
she
is
jest
tell
me
that
will
you
oh
tell
she
a
relation
by
marriage
was
the
answer
muffled
by
the
bed
clothes
maybe
that
be
true
by
the
time
they
ask
i
bet
it
wo
snorted
the
rebel
captain
perez
fell
asleep
almost
immediately
captain
jerry
tired
out
did
the
same
but
captain
eri
eyes
did
not
close
the
surf
pounded
and
grumbled
a
rooster
early
astir
crowed
somewhere
in
the
distance
daniel
thumped
the
side
of
his
stall
and
then
subsided
for
another
nap
the
gray
morning
light
brightened
the
window
of
the
little
house
then
captain
eri
slid
silently
out
of
bed
dressed
with
elaborate
precautions
against
noise
put
on
his
cap
and
tiptoed
out
of
the
house
he
walked
through
the
dripping
grass
climbed
the
back
fence
and
hurried
to
the
hill
where
john
baxter
had
fallen
once
there
he
looked
carefully
around
to
be
sure
that
no
one
was
watching
orham
as
a
rule
is
an
early
riser
but
this
morning
most
of
the
inhabitants
having
been
up
for
the
greater
part
of
the
night
were
making
up
lost
sleep
and
the
captain
was
absolutely
alone
assured
of
this
he
turned
to
the
bush
underneath
which
he
had
hidden
the
burned
coat
pushed
aside
the
drenched
boughs
with
their
fading
leaves
and
reached
down
for
the
garment
and
then
he
made
an
unpleasant
discovery
the
coat
was
gone
he
spent
an
agitated
quarter
of
an
hour
hunting
through
every
clump
of
bushes
in
the
immediate
vicinity
but
there
was
no
doubt
of
it
someone
had
been
there
before
him
and
had
taken
the
coat
away
chapter

housekeeper
and
book
agent
there
was
a
knock
on
the
door
of
captain
perez
sleeping
apartment
hedge
said
mrs
snow

a
jiffy
perez
turn
out
there
turn
out
i
tell
you
captain
eri
had
fallen
asleep
in
the
rocker
where
he
had
seated
himself
upon
his
return
from
the
fruitless
search
for
the
coat
he
had
had
no
intention
of
sleeping
but
he
was
tired
after
his
strenuous
work
at
the
fire
and
had
dropped
off
in
the
midst
of
his
worry
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
tried
to
separate
dreams
from
realities
land
of
love
perez
he
ejaculated
here
you
and
me
have
been
sleepin
the
forenoon
we
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
ourselves
git
dressed
quicker
chain
dressed
queried
perez
sitting
up
in
bed
i
should
think
you
was
dressed
now
boots
and
all
what
are
you
talkin
the
captain
glanced
down
at
his
clothes
and
seemed
as
much
surprised
as
his
friend
he
managed
to
pull
himself
together
however
and
stammered
dressed
oh
i
dressed
of
course
it
you
i
tryin
to
git
some
life
well
why
did
you
call
a
feller
of
gittin
up
and
all
by
yourself
i
never
see
such
a
critter
where
my
socks
to
avoid
further
perplexing
questions
captain
eri
went
into
the
dining
room
the
table
was
set
really
set
with
a
clean
cloth
and
dishes
that
shone
the
knives
and
forks
were
arranged
by
the
plates
not
piled
in
a
heap
for
each
man
to
help
himself
the
captain
gasped
well
i
swan
to
man
he
said
has
jerry
had
a
fit
or
what
struck
him
i
ai
seen
him
do
anything
like
this
for
i
do
know
oh
burgess
did
fix
the
table
if
that
what
you
mean
said
the
new
nurse
baxter
seemed
to
be
sleepin
or
in
a
stupor
like
and
the
doctor
when
he
come
said
i
might
leave
him
long
enough
to
run
downstairs
for
a
few
minutes
so
the
doctor
has
the
doctor
been
here
this
mornin
yes
he
come
an
hour
ago
now
if
you
would
mind
goin
up
and
stayin
with
baxter
for
a
few
minutes
while
i
finish
breakfast
i
been
up
and
down
so
many
times
in
the
last
hour
i
do
know
i
sartin
whether
i
on
my
head
or
my
the
captain
went
upstairs
in
a
dazed
state
as
he
passed
through
what
had
been
his
room
he
vaguely
noticed
that
the
bureau
top
was
clean
and
that
most
of
the
rubbish
that
had
ornamented
it
had
disappeared
the
sick
man
lay
just
as
he
had
left
him
his
white
face
as
colorless
as
the
clean
pillow
case
against
which
it
rested
captain
eri
remembered
that
the
pillow
cases
in
the
spare
room
had
looked
a
little
yellow
the
night
before
possibly
owing
to
the
fact
that
as
the
room
had
not
been
occupied
for
months
they
had
not
been
changed
he
reasoned
that
the
improvement
was
another
one
of
the
reforms
instituted
by
the
lady
from
nantucket
he
sat
down
in
the
rocker
by
the
bed
and
thought
with
a
shiver
of
the
missing
coat
there
were
nine
chances
out
of
ten
that
whoever
found
it
would
recognize
it
as
belonging
to
the
old
the
contents
of
the
pocket
would
be
almost
certain
to
reveal
the
secret
if
the
coat
itself
did
not
it
remained
to
be
seen
who
the
finder
was
and
what
he
would
do
meanwhile
there
was
no
use
worrying
having
come
to
this
conclusion
the
captain
with
customary
philosophy
resolved
to
think
of
something
else
mrs
snow
entered
and
announced
that
breakfast
was
ready
and
that
he
must
go
down
at
once
and
eat
it
while
it
was
hot
she
having
breakfasted
some
time
before
would
stay
with
the
patient
until
the
meal
was
over
captain
eri
at
first
flatly
declined
to
listen
to
any
such
arrangement
but
the
calm
insistence
of
the
nantucket
visitor
prevailed
as
usual
the
captain
realized
that
the
capacity
for
bossin
things
that
he
had
discerned
in
the
letter
was
even
more
apparent
in
the
lady
herself
one
thing
he
did
insist
upon
however
and
this
was
that
mrs
snow
should
turn
in
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
one
of
the
three
would
take
the
watch
in
the
sick
room
while
the
other
two
washed
the
dishes
the
nurse
was
inclined
to
balk
on
the
dishwashing
proposition
saying
that
she
could
do
it
herself
after
she
had
had
a
wink
or
two
but
this
the
captain
would
hear
of
he
went
away
however
with
an
unsettled
conviction
that
although
he
and
his
partners
might
wash
the
dishes
mrs
snow
would
wash
them
again
as
soon
as
she
had
an
opportunity
she
did
say
so
but
she
sort
of
looked
it
he
explained
afterward
he
found
his
friends
seated
at
the
table
and
feasting
on
hot
biscuits
eggs
and
clear
appetizing
coffee
they
greeted
him
joyously
hey
eri
hailed
captain
perez
ai
this
gay
look
at
them
eggs
jest
to
a
ai
much
like
jerry
raw
humph
you
need
say
nothin
perez
observed
captain
jerry
his
mouth
full
of
biscuit
when
you
was
cook
you
allers
so
hard
they
dent
the
barn
if
you
fired
at
it
how
john
eri
captain
eri
gave
his
and
the
doctor
opinion
of
his
friend
condition
and
then
said
now
we
got
to
have
some
kind
of
a
settlement
on
this
marryin
question
last
night
when
i
was
up
in
the
room
there
it
come
acrost
me
all
of
a
sudden
that
from
what
i
seen
of
this
nantucket
woman
she
be
jest
the
sort
of
nurse
that
john
needed
so
i
skipped
out
while
you
fellers
was
busy
with
the
doctor
found
her
at
the
hotel
explained
things
to
her
and
got
her
to
come
down
that
all
there
is
to
that
i
ai
made
no
arrangement
with
her
and
somethin
got
to
be
done
what
do
you
think
of
her
jedgin
by
what
you
seen
captain
perez
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
she
was
all
right
and
added
if
jerry
here
so
pigheaded
all
at
once
he
marry
her
without
waitin
another
eri
nodded
that
my
idee
he
said
emphatically
but
captain
jerry
was
as
obstinate
as
ever
he
simply
would
not
consider
immediate
marriage
in
vain
his
comrades
reminded
him
of
the
original
compact
and
the
fact
that
the
vote
was
two
to
one
against
him
he
announced
that
he
had
changed
his
mind
and
that
that
was
all
there
was
about
it
at
length
captain
eri
lost
patience
jerry
he
exclaimed
you
remind
me
of
that
old
white
hen
we
used
to
have
when
we
did
want
her
to
set
she
set
on
anything
from
a
doorknob
to
a
rock
could
keep
her
off
but
when
we
give
in
finally
and
got
a
settin
of
eggs
for
her
she
would
come
nigher
to
than
the
other
end
of
the
now
you
might
as
well
make
up
your
mind
that
somethin
got
to
be
done
this
mrs
snow
ai
nobody
fool
we
put
out
a
bait
that
anybody
with
sense
would
say
could
catch
but
sculpin
and
by
mighty
we
hooked
a
halibut
if
the
woman
was
anything
like
what
you
think
she
be
answerin
an
advertisement
like
that
i
be
the
fust
to
say
let
her
go
but
she
ai
she
all
right
and
we
need
her
to
nuss
john
tell
you
what
we
might
do
said
perez
slowly
we
might
explain
to
her
that
jerry
do
feel
that
be
right
to
think
of
marryin
with
baxter
so
sick
in
the
house
and
that
if
she
willin
we
put
it
off
till
he
dies
or
gets
better
meantime
we
pay
her
so
much
to
stay
here
and
nuss
seems
to
me
that
about
the
only
way
out
of
so
they
agreed
to
lay
this
proposal
before
the
nantucket
lady
captain
jerry
reluctantly
consenting
then
captain
eri
took
up
another
subject
john
baxter
as
has
been
said
had
one
relative
a
granddaughter
living
somewhere
near
boston
captain
eri
felt
that
this
granddaughter
should
be
notified
of
the
old
man
illness
at
once
the
difficulty
was
that
none
of
them
knew
the
young
lady
address
her
fust
name
elizabeth
same
as
her
mothers
was
said
eri
and
her
dad
name
was
preston
they
called
her
elsie
john
used
to
write
to
her
every
once
in
a
while
sam
would
know
where
she
jest
cause
sam
postmaster
observed
perez
it
do
foller
that
he
reads
the
name
on
every
letter
that
goes
out
and
remembers
well
if
he
do
said
captain
jerry
decidedly
mary
emma
does
she
reads
everything
postals
and
miss
mary
emma
cahoon
was
the
assistant
at
the
and
was
possessed
of
a
curiosity
concerning
other
correspondence
humph
exclaimed
captain
eri
that
so
we
write
the
letter
and
i
ask
mary
emma
for
the
address
when
i
go
up
to
mail
so
captain
perez
went
upstairs
to
take
mrs
snow
place
as
nurse
while
that
lady
turned
captain
jerry
went
into
the
kitchen
to
wash
the
dishes
and
captain
eri
sat
down
to
write
the
note
that
should
inform
elizabeth
preston
of
her
grandfather
illness
it
was
a
very
short
note
and
merely
stated
the
fact
without
further
information
having
had
some
experience
in
that
line
the
captain
placed
very
little
reliance
upon
the
help
to
be
expected
from
relatives
palmer
had
spread
the
news
as
he
went
upon
his
round
of
visits
that
morning
and
callers
began
to
drop
in
to
inquire
after
the
sick
man
miss
busteed
was
one
of
the
first
arrivals
and
as
captain
eri
had
seen
her
through
the
window
he
went
upstairs
and
took
perez
place
as
temporary
nurse
to
perez
therefore
fell
the
delightful
task
of
entertaining
the
voluble
female
for
something
like
an
hour
while
she
talked
fire
paralysis
and
general
gossip
at
express
speed
ralph
hazeltine
came
in
a
little
later
and
was
introduced
to
mrs
snow
that
lady
nap
having
been
but
a
short
one
ralph
was
favorably
impressed
with
the
capable
appearance
of
the
new
nurse
and
so
expressed
himself
to
captain
eri
as
they
walked
together
toward
the
i
like
her
he
said
emphatically
she
quiet
and
sensible
and
cheerful
besides
she
looks
as
if
trouble
did
trouble
her
very
i
jedge
she
seen
enough
of
it
in
her
time
too
observed
the
captain
reflectively
queer
thing
how
trouble
acts
different
on
folks
kind
of
like
hot
weather
sours
milk
but
sweetens
apples
she
one
of
the
sweetened
kind
and
yet
i
she
can
be
pretty
sharp
too
if
you
try
to
tread
on
her
toes
sort
of
a
sweet
pickle
hey
and
he
laughed
miss
cahoon
remembered
the
preston
girl
address
it
was
cambridge
kirkland
street
but
the
number
she
did
declare
had
skipped
her
mind
the
captain
said
he
would
chance
it
without
the
number
so
the
letter
was
posted
then
with
the
electrician
he
strolled
over
to
inspect
the
remains
of
the
billiard
saloon
there
was
a
small
crowd
gathered
about
the
building
prominent
among
its
members
being
the
train
committee
who
were
evidently
holding
a
special
session
on
this
momentous
occasion
the
busy
squealer
a
trifle
enlivened
by
some
of
saunders
wet
goods
that
had
escaped
the
efforts
of
the
volunteer
salvage
corps
hailed
the
new
arrivals
as
brother
heroes
well
now
eri
he
exclaimed
shaking
hands
vigorously
and
hazeltine
too
how
you
feelin
after
last
night
i
says
to
web
i
says
folks
in
this
town
besides
me
that
kept
you
from
the
whole
thing
and
you
ought
to
thank
i
says
of
eri
and
one
hazeltine
if
we
three
did
work
then
do
know
i
web
found
out
how
the
fire
started
yit
inquired
the
captain
with
apparent
unconcern
no
he
hai
for
sure
there
was
a
lot
of
us
thought
old
baxter
might
have
set
it
but
they
tell
me
it
could
have
been
him
cause
he
was
took
down
runnin
to
the
fire
web
he
sort
of
changed
his
tune
and
do
seem
to
think
anybody
set
it
thinks
it
catched
saunders
his
smooth
self
again
with
all
traces
of
mental
disturbance
gone
from
his
face
and
all
roughness
from
his
tongue
came
briskly
up
smiling
as
if
the
burning
of
his
place
of
business
was
but
a
trifling
incident
a
little
annoying
of
course
but
not
worth
fretting
about
he
thanked
the
captain
and
hazeltine
effusively
for
their
service
of
the
previous
night
and
piled
the
weight
of
his
obligations
upon
them
until
as
captain
eri
said
afterwards
the
syrup
fairly
dripped
off
his
the
captain
broke
in
upon
the
sugary
flow
as
soon
as
he
could
how
think
it
started
web
he
asked
well
replied
saunders
slowly
i
kind
of
she
started
herself
there
was
some
of
the
boys
in
here
most
of
the
evenin
and
jest
like
not
a
cigar
butt
or
a
match
or
dropped
somewheres
and
got
to
smolderin
and
smoldered
along
till
puff
an
expressive
wave
of
a
fat
hand
finished
the
sentence
humph
grunted
the
captain
changed
your
mind
sence
last
night
seems
to
me
i
heard
you
then
swearin
you
knew
was
set
and
who
set
well
i
was
considerable
shook
up
last
night
and
maybe
i
said
things
i
had
ought
to
you
see
there
been
a
good
deal
of
hard
feelin
towards
me
in
town
and
for
a
spell
i
thought
some
tried
to
burn
me
out
but
i
guess
not
i
guess
not
more
i
think
of
it
more
i
think
it
catched
itself
seems
to
me
i
remember
smellin
sort
of
a
scorchin
smell
when
i
was
lockin
up
oh
say
i
was
mighty
sorry
to
hear
baxter
bein
took
sick
the
old
man
was
dreadful
down
on
liquor
but
i
laid
that
to
his
religion
and
never
had
no
hard
feelin
against
him
how
he
gittin
along
captain
eri
brusquely
replied
that
his
friend
was
the
same
and
asked
if
saunders
intended
to
rebuild
web
did
know
just
yet
he
was
a
poor
man
did
carry
much
insurance
and
so
on
thought
likely
he
should
fix
up
again
if
it
did
cost
too
much
did
the
doctor
say
whether
captain
baxter
would
pull
through
or
not
captain
eri
gave
an
evasive
answer
and
turned
away
he
was
silent
for
some
little
time
and
when
ralph
commented
on
web
overnight
change
of
manner
his
rejoinder
was
to
the
effect
that
ile
was
bound
to
rise
but
that
did
mean
there
dirty
water
on
the
way
home
he
asked
hazeltine
concerning
the
trouble
at
the
cable
station
and
how
langley
had
treated
the
matter
ralph
replied
that
langley
had
said
nothing
to
him
about
it
it
was
his
opinion
that
the
old
gentleman
understood
the
affair
pretty
well
and
was
not
disposed
to
blame
him
as
for
the
men
they
had
been
as
docile
as
lambs
and
he
thought
the
feeling
toward
himself
was
not
as
bitter
as
it
had
been
all
of
which
his
companion
said
he
was
glad
to
hear
they
separated
at
the
gate
and
the
captain
entered
the
house
to
find
mrs
snow
wielding
a
broom
and
surrounded
by
a
cloud
of
dust
perez
was
upstairs
with
the
patient
and
captain
jerry
whose
habits
had
been
considerably
upset
by
the
sweeping
was
out
in
the
barn
that
evening
the
situation
was
explained
to
mrs
snow
by
captain
eri
in
accordance
with
the
talk
at
the
breakfast
table
the
lady
from
nantucket
understood
and
respected
captain
jerry
unwillingness
to
discuss
the
marriage
question
while
john
baxter
condition
continued
critical
and
she
agreed
to
act
as
nurse
and
housekeeper
for
a
while
at
least
for
the
sum
of
six
dollars
a
week
this
price
was
fixed
only
after
considerable
discussion
by
the
three
mariners
for
captain
eri
was
inclined
to
offer
eight
and
captain
jerry
but
four
when
ralph
hazeltine
called
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
following
day
the
dining
room
was
so
transformed
that
he
scarcely
knew
it
the
dust
had
disappeared
the
chronometer
was
polished
till
it
shone
the
table
was
covered
with
a
cloth
that
was
and
everything
movable
had
the
appearance
of
being
in
its
place
altogether
there
was
an
evidence
of
order
that
was
almost
startling
captain
eri
came
to
the
door
in
response
to
his
knock
and
grinned
appreciatively
at
his
caller
look
of
wonder
i
do
wonder
you
he
said
with
a
chuckle
i
begun
to
git
over
it
yit
myself
and
lorenzo
so
shook
up
he
been
in
the
house
sence
breakfast
time
he
out
in
the
barn
and
waitin
for
the
end
of
the
world
to
strike
i
ralph
laughed
mrs
snow
he
inquired
mrs
snow
answered
the
captain
it
beats
all
what
a
woman
can
do
when
she
that
kind
of
a
woman
she
done
more
swabbin
decks
and
overhaulin
runnin
riggin
than
a
new
mate
on
a
clipper
the
place
is
so
clean
that
i
feel
like
brushin
myself
every
time
i
go
to
set
how
captain
baxter
asked
hazeltine
seems
to
be
some
better
he
come
to
a
little
this
mornin
and
seemed
to
know
some
of
us
but
he
ai
sensed
where
he
is
yit
nor
i
he
will
fur
a
spell
set
down
and
keep
me
it
my
watch
jest
now
perez
he
over
to
barry
jerry
up
to
the
schoolhouse
and
mrs
snow
run
up
to
the
to
mail
a
letter
asleep
so
i
can
stay
downstairs
a
little
while
long
the
door
open
what
the
news
uptown
web
changed
his
mind
the
fire
it
appeared
that
saunders
had
not
changed
his
mind
at
least
so
current
gossip
reported
and
it
may
be
remarked
here
that
curiously
enough
the
opinion
that
the
fire
caught
itself
came
at
last
to
be
generally
accepted
in
the
village
for
some
weeks
captain
eri
was
troubled
with
thoughts
concerning
the
missing
coat
but
as
time
passed
and
the
accusing
garment
did
not
turn
up
he
came
to
believe
that
some
boy
must
have
found
it
and
that
it
had
in
all
probability
been
destroyed
there
were
of
course
some
persons
who
still
suspected
john
baxter
as
the
incendiary
but
the
old
man
serious
illness
and
respect
for
his
former
standing
in
the
community
kept
these
few
silent
the
baxter
house
had
been
locked
up
and
the
captain
had
the
key
hazeltine
and
his
host
chatted
for
a
few
minutes
on
various
topics
the
gilt
titles
on
the
imposing
lives
of
great
naval
commanders
having
received
their
share
of
the
general
dusting
now
shone
forth
resplendent
and
the
captain
noticed
ralph
eye
as
it
involuntarily
turned
toward
them
noticin
our
library
he
chuckled
perez
property
that
is
black
talked
him
into
buyin
never
met
did
you
no
i
guess
likely
not
she
lives
over
to
the
neck
and
do
git
down
to
the
village
much
what
you
call
a
business
woman
she
always
up
to
somethin
to
make
a
dollar
and
she
as
slick
a
talker
as
ever
was
i
guess
she
never
give
perez
no
rest
till
he
signed
the
deed
for
them
books
told
him
they
give
tone
to
the
shebang
perez
started
to
read
out
loud
when
they
fust
come
but
he
had
to
stop
so
often
to
spell
out
the
furrin
names
that
me
and
jerry
used
to
go
to
sleep
that
made
him
mad
and
he
said
tone
be
durned
he
goin
to
waste
his
breath
readin
us
to
sleep
so
they
been
on
the
shelf
ever
ralph
laughed
so
you
have
book
agents
too
he
said
well
we
got
was
the
reply
and
she
enough
to
keep
us
goin
gits
round
as
clockwork
once
a
month
to
collect
the
two
dollars
from
perez
it
her
day
now
and
i
told
perez
that
that
was
why
he
sneaked
off
to
barry
you
see
after
him
to
buy
the
history
of
methuselah
or
some
old
critter
and
he
do
like
to
see
her
she
after
me
too
but
i
she
do
git
much
after
they
had
talked
a
little
longer
the
captain
seemed
to
remember
something
for
he
glanced
at
his
watch
and
said
mr
hazeltine
i
wonder
if
i
could
git
you
to
do
me
a
favor
i
really
ought
to
go
down
and
see
to
my
shanty
ai
been
there
sence
day
afore
yesterday
and
there
so
many
boys
i
to
leave
it
unlocked
much
longer
i
thought
some
of
the
folks
would
be
back
this
but
if
you
could
stay
here
long
enough
for
me
to
run
down
there
a
minute
or
two
i
be
ever
so
much
obliged
i
step
up
and
see
how
john
he
went
upstairs
and
returned
to
report
that
the
patient
was
quiet
and
seemed
to
be
asleep
if
you
hear
him
groan
or
anything
he
said
jest
come
to
the
door
and
whistle
whistle
anyway
if
you
want
me
ai
nobody
likely
to
come
it
or
the
reverend
perley
come
to
ask
john
if
it
a
middlin
young
woman
with
a
satchel
do
whistle
tell
her
i
out
i
be
back
in
a
jiffy
but
you
need
tell
either
of
them
so
unless
your
conscience
hurts
you
too
after
the
captain
had
gone
ralph
took
down
a
volume
of
the
great
commanders
and
sat
down
in
a
chair
by
the
table
to
look
it
over
he
was
smiling
over
the
gaudy
illustrations
and
flamboyant
descriptions
of
battles
when
there
was
a
step
on
the
walk
outside
and
knock
at
the
door
which
is
it
he
thought
or
the
reverend
obviously
it
was
miss
black
she
stood
on
the
mica
slab
that
formed
the
step
and
looked
up
at
him
as
he
swung
the
door
open
she
had
a
small
leather
bag
in
her
hand
just
as
the
captain
had
said
she
would
have
but
it
flashed
across
hazeltine
mind
that
the
rest
of
the
description
was
not
a
fair
one
she
was
certainly
much
more
than
middlin
is
captain
hedge
in
she
asked
now
from
his
friend
hints
ralph
had
expected
to
hear
a
rather
sharp
and
unpleasant
voice
certain
disagreeable
remembrances
of
former
encounters
with
female
book
agents
had
helped
to
form
the
impression
perhaps
but
miss
black
voice
was
mellow
quiet
and
rather
pleasing
than
otherwise
no
said
hazeltine
obeying
orders
with
exactitude
captain
hedge
is
out
just
somehow
the
name
did
seem
to
fit
was
manifestly
disappointed
oh
dear
she
said
and
then
added
will
he
be
back
soon
now
this
was
a
question
unprovided
for
ralph
stammered
and
then
miserably
equivocated
he
really
could
say
just
when
the
captain
would
return
oh
dear
said
the
young
lady
again
then
she
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
some
further
observation
on
the
part
of
the
gentleman
at
the
door
none
being
forthcoming
she
seemed
to
make
up
her
mind
to
act
on
her
own
initiative
i
think
i
will
come
in
and
wait
she
said
with
decision
and
come
in
she
did
hazeltine
not
knowing
exactly
what
to
do
under
the
circumstances
now
this
was
much
more
in
keeping
with
the
electrician
preconceived
ideas
of
a
book
agent
behavior
nevertheless
when
he
turned
and
found
the
young
lady
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
he
felt
obliged
to
be
at
least
decently
polite
wo
you
take
a
chair
he
asked
thank
you
said
the
caller
and
took
one
the
situation
was
extremely
awkward
but
ralph
felt
that
loyalty
to
captain
eri
forbade
his
doing
anything
that
might
urge
the
miss
black
to
prolong
her
visit
so
for
a
time
he
said
nothing
the
young
lady
looked
out
of
the
window
and
hazeltine
looked
at
her
he
was
more
than
ever
of
the
opinion
that
the
middlin
term
should
be
cut
out
of
her
description
he
rather
liked
her
appearance
so
he
decided
he
liked
the
way
she
wore
her
hair
so
simple
an
arrangement
but
so
effective
also
he
liked
her
dress
it
was
the
first
walking
suit
he
had
seen
since
his
arrival
in
orham
and
worn
by
a
country
book
agent
of
all
people
just
then
miss
black
turned
and
caught
him
intently
gazing
at
her
she
colored
apparently
with
displeasure
and
looked
out
of
the
window
again
hazeltine
colored
also
and
fidgeted
with
the
book
on
the
table
the
situation
was
confoundedly
embarrassing
he
felt
that
he
must
say
something
now
so
he
made
the
original
observation
that
it
had
been
a
pleasant
day
to
this
the
young
lady
agreed
but
there
was
no
enthusiasm
in
her
tone
then
ralph
nervously
fishing
for
another
topic
thought
of
the
book
in
his
hand
i
was
just
reading
this
he
said
i
found
it
quite
the
next
moment
he
realized
that
he
had
said
what
of
all
things
was
the
most
impolitic
it
was
nothing
less
than
a
bid
for
a
canvass
and
he
fully
expected
to
be
confronted
with
the
necessary
order
blanks
without
delay
but
strangely
enough
the
book
lady
made
no
such
move
she
looked
at
him
it
is
true
but
with
an
expression
of
surprise
and
what
seemed
to
be
amusement
on
her
face
he
was
certain
that
her
lips
twitched
as
she
said
calmly
did
you
i
am
glad
to
hear
this
dispassionate
remark
was
entirely
unexpected
and
the
electrician
as
captain
eri
would
have
said
lost
his
bearings
completely
yes
er
yes
he
stammered
very
interesting
indeed
i
i
suppose
you
must
take
a
good
many
orders
in
the
course
of
a
a
good
many
orders
why
yes
orders
for
the
books
i
mean
the
books
the
naval
lives
er
these
books
i
beg
your
pardon
but
who
do
you
think
i
am
and
it
was
then
that
the
perception
of
some
tremendous
blunder
began
to
seize
upon
hazeltine
he
had
been
red
before
now
he
felt
the
redness
creeping
over
his
scalp
under
his
hair
why
why
miss
black
i
suppose
that
is
i
just
here
the
door
opened
and
captain
eri
came
in
he
took
off
his
cap
and
then
seeing
the
visitor
remained
standing
apparently
waiting
for
an
introduction
but
the
young
lady
did
not
keep
him
waiting
long
are
you
captain
eri
hedge
she
asked
yes
answered
the
captain
oh
i
so
glad
your
letter
came
this
morning
and
i
hurried
down
on
the
first
train
i
elizabeth
chapter
ix
elsie
preston
perhaps
on
the
whole
it
is
not
surprising
that
captain
eri
grasp
the
situation
neither
his
two
partners
nor
himself
had
given
much
thought
to
the
granddaughter
of
the
sick
man
in
the
upper
room
the
captain
knew
that
there
was
a
granddaughter
hence
his
letter
but
he
had
heard
john
baxter
speak
of
her
as
being
in
school
somewhere
in
boston
and
had
all
along
conceived
of
her
as
a
miss
of
sixteen
or
thereabouts
no
wonder
that
at
first
he
looked
at
the
stylishly
gowned
young
woman
who
stood
before
him
with
one
gloved
hand
extended
in
a
puzzled
uncomprehending
way
excuse
me
he
said
slowly
mechanically
swallowing
up
the
proffered
hand
in
his
own
mammoth
fist
but
i
do
know
i
jest
caught
the
name
would
you
mind
sayin
it
elizabeth
preston
repeated
the
visitor
captain
granddaughter
you
wrote
me
that
he
was
ill
you
know
and
i
what
roared
the
captain
delighted
amazement
lighting
up
his
face
like
a
sunrise
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
you
gal
elsie
well
well
i
want
to
know
if
this
do
beat
all
set
down
take
your
things
right
off
i
mighty
glad
to
see
captain
eri
hand
with
miss
preston
hidden
in
it
was
moving
up
and
down
as
if
it
worked
by
a
arrangement
the
young
lady
withdrew
her
fingers
from
the
trap
as
soon
as
she
conveniently
could
but
it
might
have
been
noticed
that
she
glanced
at
them
when
she
had
done
so
as
if
to
make
sure
that
the
original
shape
remained
thank
you
captain
hedge
she
said
and
now
please
tell
me
about
grandfather
how
is
he
may
i
see
him
the
captain
expression
changed
to
one
of
concern
why
now
miss
preston
he
said
your
grandpa
is
pretty
sick
oh
i
do
mean
he
goin
to
die
right
off
or
anything
like
that
he
added
hastily
i
mean
he
had
a
stroke
of
palsy
or
somethin
and
he
got
so
yit
that
he
senses
much
of
what
goes
on
now
i
do
want
to
frighten
you
you
know
but
really
there
a
chance
a
leetle
mite
of
a
chance
that
he
wo
know
you
do
feel
bad
if
he
do
now
will
you
i
knew
he
must
be
very
ill
from
your
letter
said
the
girl
simply
i
was
afraid
that
he
might
not
be
living
when
i
reached
here
they
told
me
at
the
station
that
he
was
at
your
house
and
so
i
came
he
has
been
very
good
to
me
and
i
her
voice
broke
a
little
and
she
hesitated
captain
eri
was
a
picture
of
nervous
distress
yes
yes
i
know
he
said
hastily
do
you
worry
now
he
better
the
doctor
said
he
was
better
did
he
hazeltine
why
what
am
i
thinkin
of
let
me
make
you
known
to
hazeltine
neighbor
of
ours
right
acrost
the
road
and
he
waved
toward
the
bay
ralph
and
miss
preston
shook
hands
the
electrician
managed
to
utter
some
sort
of
formality
but
he
could
have
told
what
it
was
he
was
glad
when
the
captain
announced
that
if
hazeltine
would
excuse
them
he
guessed
miss
preston
and
he
would
step
upstairs
and
see
john
the
young
lady
took
off
her
hat
and
jacket
and
captain
eri
lighted
a
lamp
for
it
was
almost
dark
by
this
time
as
its
light
shone
upon
the
visitor
face
and
hair
the
crimson
flush
before
mentioned
circumnavigated
the
electrician
head
once
more
and
his
bump
of
received
a
finishing
blow
that
any
man
supposed
to
possess
two
fairly
good
eyes
and
a
workable
brain
could
have
mistaken
her
for
an
orham
neck
book
agent
by
the
name
of
black
heavens
i
be
down
in
a
few
minutes
hazeltine
said
the
captain
set
still
wo
you
but
hazeltine
would
sit
still
he
announced
that
it
was
late
and
he
must
be
going
and
go
he
did
in
spite
of
his
host
protestations
look
out
for
the
stairs
cautioned
the
captain
leading
the
way
with
the
lamp
the
feller
that
built
must
have
that
distance
lengthens
out
life
come
to
think
of
it
i
would
wonder
if
them
stairs
was
the
reason
why
me
and
jerry
and
perez
took
this
house
they
reminded
us
so
of
the
shrouds
on
a
elsie
preston
did
her
best
to
smile
as
her
companion
rattled
on
in
this
fashion
but
both
the
smile
and
the
captain
cheerfulness
were
too
plainly
assumed
to
be
convincing
and
they
passed
down
the
hall
in
silence
at
the
open
door
of
the
sick
room
captain
eri
paused
he
asleep
he
whispered
and
remember
if
he
wakes
up
and
know
you
you
need
feel
elsie
slipped
by
him
and
knelt
by
the
bed
looking
into
the
white
old
face
on
the
pillow
somehow
the
harsh
lines
had
faded
out
of
it
and
it
looked
only
old
and
pitiful
the
captain
watched
the
tableau
for
a
moment
or
two
and
then
tiptoed
into
the
room
and
placed
the
lamp
on
the
bureau
now
i
think
likely
he
said
in
a
rather
husky
whisper
that
like
to
stay
with
your
grandpa
for
a
little
while
so
i
go
downstairs
and
see
about
supper
no
no
no
he
added
holding
up
his
hand
as
the
girl
spoke
some
words
of
protest
you
ai
goin
nowheres
to
supper
you
goin
to
stay
right
here
if
you
want
me
jest
and
he
hurried
downstairs
and
into
the
kitchen
clearing
his
throat
with
vigor
and
making
a
great
over
the
scratching
of
a
match
mrs
snow
returned
a
few
minutes
later
and
to
her
the
news
of
the
arrival
was
told
as
it
was
also
to
perez
and
jerry
when
they
came
mrs
snow
took
charge
of
the
supper
arrangements
when
the
meal
was
ready
she
said
to
captain
eri
now
i
go
upstairs
and
tell
her
to
come
down
i
stay
with
baxter
till
you
through
and
then
if
one
of
you
take
my
place
i
eat
my
supper
and
wash
the
dishes
you
need
come
up
now
i
introduce
some
few
minutes
passed
before
miss
preston
came
down
when
she
did
so
her
eyes
were
wet
but
her
manner
was
cheerful
and
the
unaffected
way
in
which
she
greeted
captain
perez
and
captain
jerry
when
these
two
rather
bashful
mariners
were
introduced
by
eri
won
them
at
once
the
supper
was
a
great
success
it
was
saturday
night
and
a
saturday
night
supper
to
the
average
new
englander
means
baked
beans
the
captains
had
long
ago
given
up
this
beloved
dish
because
although
each
had
tried
his
hand
at
preparing
it
none
had
wholly
succeeded
and
the
caustic
criticisms
of
the
other
two
had
prevented
further
trials
but
mrs
snow
baked
beans
were
a
triumph
so
also
was
the
brown
bread
i
snum
exclaimed
captain
perez
if
i
do
i
sooner
have
these
beans
than
turkey
what
do
you
say
jerry
i
do
know
but
i
had
assented
the
sacrifice
upon
whose
countenance
sat
a
placidity
that
had
not
been
there
since
the
night
of
the
if
the
turkey
was
like
the
one
we
tried
to
cook
last
thanksgivin
that
eri
captain
eri
his
mouth
full
grunted
an
emphatic
assent
tell
me
said
miss
preston
who
had
eaten
but
little
but
was
apparently
getting
more
satisfaction
from
watching
her
companions
did
you
three
men
try
to
keep
house
here
alone
yes
answered
eri
dryly
we
tried
first
we
thought
was
goin
to
be
fine
then
we
thought
we
like
it
better
after
we
got
used
to
it
finally
we
decided
that
by
the
time
we
got
used
to
it
we
die
like
the
horse
that
was
fed
on
and
so
you
hired
mrs
snow
to
keep
house
for
you
well
i
do
see
how
you
could
have
made
a
better
choice
she
a
dear
good
woman
sure
of
it
and
now
i
want
to
thank
you
all
for
what
you
done
for
grandfather
mrs
snow
told
me
all
about
it
you
been
so
kind
that
i
that
all
right
that
all
right
hastily
interrupted
captain
eri
pity
if
we
could
help
out
a
shipmate
we
sailed
with
for
years
and
years
but
you
ought
to
have
tried
some
of
our
cookin
tell
her
about
the
sugar
cake
you
made
perez
the
one
that
killed
the
yaller
so
captain
perez
told
it
and
then
their
visitor
set
them
all
laughing
by
relating
some
queer
housekeeping
experiences
that
she
and
a
school
friend
had
had
while
camping
at
chautauqua
somehow
each
one
felt
at
home
with
her
as
captain
eri
said
afterwards
she
did
giggle
and
then
she
did
talk
down
at
as
they
rose
from
the
table
the
young
lady
asked
a
question
concerning
the
location
of
the
hotel
the
captain
made
no
answer
at
the
time
but
after
a
short
consultation
with
the
remainder
of
the
triumvirate
he
came
to
her
as
she
stood
by
the
window
and
laying
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
said
now
elsie
i
hope
you
do
mind
my
callin
you
elsie
but
been
chums
with
your
grandpa
so
long
seems
if
you
must
be
a
sort
of
relation
of
mine
elsie
you
ai
goin
to
no
hotel
that
is
unless
you
real
set
on
it
your
grandpa
here
and
we
here
and
room
enough
i
do
want
to
say
too
much
but
i
like
to
have
you
that
me
and
perez
and
jerry
want
you
to
stay
right
in
this
house
jest
as
long
you
stop
in
orham
now
you
will
wo
you
and
so
it
was
settled
and
captain
perez
harnessed
daniel
and
went
to
the
station
for
the
trunk
that
evening
just
before
going
to
bed
the
captains
stood
by
the
door
of
the
sick
room
watching
elsie
and
the
lady
from
nantucket
as
they
sat
beside
john
baxter
bed
mrs
snow
was
knitting
and
elsie
was
reading
later
as
captain
eri
peered
out
of
the
window
to
take
a
final
look
at
the
sky
in
order
to
get
a
line
on
the
weather
he
said
slowly
fellers
do
you
know
what
i
was
thinkin
when
i
see
them
two
women
in
there
with
john
i
was
thinkin
that
it
must
be
a
mighty
pleasant
thing
to
know
that
if
you
took
sick
somebody
like
that
take
care
of
perez
nodded
i
think
so
too
he
said
but
if
this
was
meant
to
influence
the
betrothed
one
it
did
succeed
apparently
for
all
captain
jerry
said
was
humph
take
more
than
that
to
make
me
hanker
after
a
stroke
of
and
with
the
coming
of
elsie
preston
and
mrs
snow
life
in
the
little
house
by
the
shore
took
on
a
decided
change
the
nantucket
lady
having
satisfied
herself
that
john
baxter
illness
was
likely
to
be
a
long
one
wrote
several
letters
to
persons
in
her
native
town
which
letters
although
she
did
not
say
so
were
supposed
by
the
captains
to
deal
with
the
care
of
her
property
while
she
was
away
having
apparently
relieved
her
mind
by
this
method
and
evidently
considering
the
marriage
question
postponed
for
the
present
she
settled
down
to
nurse
the
sick
man
and
to
keep
house
as
in
her
opinion
a
house
should
be
kept
the
captains
knew
nothing
of
her
past
history
beyond
what
they
had
gathered
from
stray
bits
of
her
conversation
she
evidently
did
not
consider
it
necessary
to
tell
anything
further
and
on
the
other
hand
asked
no
questions
in
her
care
of
baxter
she
was
more
like
a
sister
than
a
hired
nurse
no
wife
could
have
been
more
tender
in
her
ministrations
or
more
devotedly
anxious
for
the
patient
welfare
in
her
care
of
the
house
she
was
neatness
itself
she
scoured
and
swept
and
washed
until
the
rooms
were
literally
spotless
order
was
first
law
in
her
opinion
and
she
expected
everyone
else
to
keep
up
to
the
standard
captain
perez
and
captain
eri
soon
got
used
to
the
change
and
gloried
in
it
but
to
captain
jerry
it
was
not
altogether
welcome
oh
cat
foot
he
exclaimed
one
day
after
hunting
everywhere
for
his
sunday
tie
and
at
length
finding
it
in
his
bureau
drawer
i
ca
git
used
to
this
everlastin
way
it
used
to
be
this
necktie
was
likely
to
be
anywheres
and
if
i
looked
out
in
the
kitchen
or
under
the
sofy
i
was
jest
as
likely
to
find
it
but
now
everything
got
a
place
and
is
in
well
that
the
way
it
ought
to
be
ai
it
said
eri
then
all
you
got
to
do
is
look
in
the
yes
and
that
jest
it
i
always
forgittin
the
place
my
shoes
is
sech
a
place
my
hankerchers
is
sech
a
place
my
pipe
is
sech
a
place
my
terbacker
is
another
place
when
i
want
my
pipe
i
look
where
my
shoes
is
and
when
i
want
my
shoes
i
go
and
look
where
i
found
my
pipe
how
a
feller
goin
to
keep
run
of
is
what
ca
you
was
the
one
that
did
most
of
the
growlin
when
things
was
the
old
yes
but
jest
a
man
do
want
to
live
in
a
pigpen
it
ai
no
sign
he
wants
to
be
put
under
a
glass
elsie
influence
upon
the
house
and
its
inmates
had
become
almost
as
marked
as
mrs
snow
the
young
lady
was
of
an
artistic
bent
and
the
stiff
ornaments
in
the
parlor
and
the
wonderful
jarred
upon
her
strange
to
say
even
the
wreath
that
hung
in
its
circular
black
frame
over
the
whatnot
did
not
appeal
to
her
the
captains
considered
that
wreath
it
had
been
the
principal
floral
offering
at
the
funeral
of
captain
perez
sister
and
there
was
a
lock
of
her
hair
framed
with
it
the
gem
of
the
establishment
they
could
understand
to
a
certain
degree
why
miss
preston
objected
to
the
prominence
given
the
god
bless
our
home
motto
but
her
failure
to
enthuse
over
the
wreath
was
inexplicable
but
by
degrees
they
became
used
to
seeing
the
blinds
open
at
the
parlor
windows
the
week
through
and
innovations
like
muslin
curtains
and
vases
filled
with
late
wild
flowers
came
to
be
at
first
tolerated
and
then
liked
elsie
notions
the
captains
called
them
there
were
some
great
discussions
on
art
over
the
teacups
after
supper
miss
preston
painted
very
prettily
in
and
her
sketches
were
received
with
enthusiastic
praise
by
the
captains
and
mrs
snow
but
one
day
she
painted
a
little
picture
of
a
fishing
boat
and
to
her
surprise
it
came
in
for
some
rather
sharp
criticism
that
a
pretty
picture
elsie
said
captain
eri
holding
the
sketch
at
arm
length
and
squinting
at
it
with
his
head
on
one
side
but
if
that
caleb
titcomb
boat
and
i
jedge
is
it
seems
to
me
carryin
too
much
sail
what
do
you
think
jerry
captain
jerry
took
the
painting
from
his
friend
and
critically
examined
it
also
at
arm
length
caleb
boat
ai
got
no
sech
sail
as
that
was
his
deliberate
comment
she
could
carry
it
and
stand
up
that
way
besides
the
way
i
look
at
it
she
down
by
the
head
more
she
ought
to
but
i
did
try
to
get
it
exactly
right
said
the
bewildered
artist
the
boat
sails
were
so
white
and
the
water
was
so
blue
and
the
sand
so
yellow
that
i
thought
it
made
a
pretty
picture
i
did
think
of
the
size
of
the
well
i
you
would
observed
captain
perez
who
was
looking
over
jerry
shoulder
but
you
have
to
be
awful
careful
paintin
vessels
now
you
jest
look
at
that
picture
pointing
to
the
glaring
likeness
of
the
flying
duck
that
hung
on
the
wall
jest
look
at
them
sails
every
one
of
drawin
fine
and
them
ropes
every
one
in
jest
the
right
place
that
what
i
call
but
do
you
think
captain
perez
that
the
waves
in
that
picture
would
be
better
if
they
were
so
all
in
a
row
like
a
picket
fence
well
now
that
ai
it
that
a
picture
of
the
schooner
flyin
duck
and
the
waves
is
only
thrown
in
as
you
might
say
the
reel
thing
is
the
schooner
rigged
jest
right
trimmed
jest
right
and
colored
jest
the
way
the
flyin
duck
was
colored
you
understand
them
waves
was
put
there
jest
there
had
to
be
some
to
set
the
schooner
in
that
but
you
need
feel
bad
elsie
said
captain
jerry
soothingly
to
be
expected
that
you
could
paint
vessels
like
eben
lothrop
can
eben
he
used
to
work
in
a
shipyard
up
to
east
boston
once
and
when
he
was
there
he
had
to
paint
schooners
and
things
reely
put
the
paint
onto
i
mean
so
of
course
when
it
come
to
paintin
pictures
of
why
and
captain
jerry
waved
his
hand
so
as
there
was
no
answer
to
an
argument
like
this
miss
preston
gave
up
marine
painting
for
the
time
and
began
a
of
the
house
and
its
inmates
this
was
an
elaborate
affair
and
as
the
captains
insisted
that
each
member
of
the
family
daniel
and
lorenzo
included
should
pose
it
seemed
unlikely
to
be
finished
for
some
months
at
least
ralph
hazeltine
called
on
the
afternoon
following
elsie
arrival
and
captain
eri
insisted
on
his
staying
to
tea
it
might
have
been
noticed
that
the
electrician
seemed
a
trifle
embarrassed
when
miss
preston
came
into
the
room
but
as
the
young
lady
was
not
embarrassed
in
the
least
and
had
apparently
forgotten
the
incident
his
nervousness
soon
wore
off
but
it
came
back
again
when
captain
eri
said
oh
i
say
hazeltine
i
forgot
to
ask
you
did
come
yesterday
ralph
answered
rather
hurriedly
that
she
did
not
he
endeavored
to
change
the
subject
but
the
captain
would
let
him
well
there
he
exclaimed
amazedly
if
ai
broke
her
record
fust
time
sence
perez
was
took
with
the
commander
disease
that
she
ai
been
on
hand
when
the
month
was
up
to
git
her
two
dollars
got
so
we
sort
of
reckoned
by
her
like
an
almanac
kind
of
thought
she
was
sure
like
death
and
taxes
and
now
she
has
gone
back
on
us
blessed
if
i
ai
in
who
is
she
inquired
mrs
snow
one
of
those
critters
well
if
you
called
her
that
to
her
face
i
expect
there
be
squalls
but
i
she
could
prove
a
alibi
in
now
it
may
have
been
hazeltine
fancy
but
he
could
have
sworn
that
there
was
just
the
suspicion
of
a
twinkle
in
miss
preston
eye
as
she
asked
innocently
enough
is
she
a
young
lady
captain
eri
well
she
hopes
she
is
was
the
deliberate
answer
why
does
she
look
like
me
like
you
oh
my
soul
and
body
wait
till
you
see
her
what
made
you
ask
that
oh
nothing
i
was
a
little
curious
that
all
have
you
seen
her
hazeltine
ralph
stammered
somewhat
confusedly
that
he
had
had
the
pleasure
the
captain
glanced
from
the
electrician
to
miss
preston
and
back
again
then
he
suddenly
realized
the
situation
ho
ho
he
roared
slapping
his
knee
and
rocking
back
and
forth
in
his
chair
do
for
the
land
sake
tell
me
you
took
elsie
here
for
black
do
now
do
he
asked
me
if
i
had
taken
many
orders
remarked
the
young
lady
demurely
when
the
general
hilarity
had
abated
a
little
ralph
penitently
explained
that
it
was
dark
that
captain
eri
had
said
miss
black
was
young
and
that
she
carried
a
bag
so
i
did
so
i
did
chuckled
the
captain
i
was
enough
but
oh
dear
it
awful
funny
now
elsie
you
ought
to
feel
flattered
wait
till
you
see
hat
the
one
she
got
up
to
am
i
forgiven
miss
preston
asked
hazeltine
as
he
said
well
i
do
know
was
the
rather
answer
i
think
i
shall
have
to
wait
until
i
see
but
hazeltine
apparently
took
his
forgiveness
for
granted
for
his
calls
became
more
and
more
frequent
until
his
dropping
in
after
supper
came
to
be
a
regular
occurrence
young
people
of
the
better
class
are
scarce
in
orham
during
the
fall
and
winter
months
and
ralph
found
few
congenial
companions
he
liked
the
captains
and
mrs
snow
and
society
was
a
relief
after
a
day
with
the
operators
at
the
station
langley
was
entirely
absorbed
in
his
business
and
spent
his
evenings
in
his
room
reading
and
smoking
so
september
and
october
passed
and
november
came
school
opened
in
october
and
the
captains
had
another
boarder
for
josiah
bartlett
against
his
wishes
gave
up
his
position
as
and
was
sent
to
school
again
as
the
boy
was
no
longer
employed
at
the
livery
stable
captain
perez
felt
the
necessity
of
having
him
under
his
eye
and
so
josiah
lived
at
the
house
by
the
shore
a
cot
being
set
up
in
the
parlor
for
his
use
his
coming
made
more
work
for
mrs
snow
but
that
energetic
lady
did
not
seem
to
mind
and
even
succeeded
in
getting
the
youngster
to
do
a
few
chores
about
the
place
an
achievement
that
won
the
everlasting
admiration
of
captain
perez
who
had
no
governing
power
whatever
over
the
boy
and
condoned
the
most
of
his
faults
or
scolded
him
feebly
for
the
others
john
baxter
continued
to
waver
between
this
world
and
the
next
he
had
intervals
of
consciousness
in
which
he
recognized
the
captains
and
elsie
but
these
rational
moments
were
few
and
although
he
talked
a
little
he
never
mentioned
recent
events
nor
alluded
to
the
fire
the
fire
itself
became
an
old
story
and
gossip
took
up
other
subjects
the
held
a
jubilee
service
because
of
the
destruction
of
the
saloon
but
as
web
soon
began
to
rebuild
and
repair
their
jollification
was
as
for
saunders
he
was
the
same
unctuous
smiling
personage
that
he
had
formerly
been
it
was
a
curious
fact
and
one
that
captain
eri
noted
that
he
never
ceased
to
inquire
after
john
baxter
health
and
seemed
honestly
glad
to
hear
of
the
old
man
improvement
he
asked
a
good
many
questions
about
elsie
too
but
received
little
satisfaction
from
the
captain
on
this
subject
chapter
x
matchmaking
and
captain
jerry
sat
behind
the
woodshed
in
the
sunshine
smoking
and
thinking
he
had
done
a
good
deal
of
the
first
ever
since
he
was
sixteen
years
old
the
second
was
in
a
measure
a
more
recent
acquirement
the
captain
had
things
on
his
mind
it
was
one
of
those
perfect
springlike
mornings
that
sometimes
come
in
early
november
the
sky
was
clear
blue
and
the
air
was
so
free
from
haze
that
the
houses
at
cranberry
point
could
be
seen
in
every
detail
the
flag
on
the
cable
station
across
the
bay
stood
out
stiff
in
the
steady
breeze
and
one
might
almost
count
the
stripes
the
pines
on
signal
hill
were
a
bright
green
patch
against
the
yellow
grass
the
sea
was
a
dark
sapphire
with
slashes
of
silver
to
mark
the
shoals
and
the
horizon
was
notched
with
sails
the
boats
at
anchor
in
front
of
the
shanties
swung
with
the
outgoing
tide
then
came
captain
eri
also
smoking
hello
said
captain
jerry
how
is
it
you
ai
off
fishin
a
like
this
somethin
else
on
the
docket
was
the
answer
how
matchmakin
these
days
now
this
question
touched
vitally
the
subject
of
captain
thoughts
from
a
placid
easygoing
retired
mariner
recent
events
had
transformed
the
captain
into
a
plotter
a
man
with
a
scheme
as
the
gentlemanly
villain
of
the
melodrama
used
to
love
to
call
it
to
tell
the
truth
petticoat
government
was
wearing
on
him
the
marriage
agreement
to
which
his
partners
considered
him
bound
and
which
he
saw
no
way
to
evade
hung
over
him
always
but
he
had
put
this
threat
of
the
future
from
his
mind
so
far
as
possible
he
had
not
found
orderly
housekeeping
the
joy
that
he
once
thought
it
would
be
but
even
this
he
could
bear
elsie
preston
was
the
drop
too
much
he
liked
mrs
snow
except
in
a
marrying
sense
he
liked
elsie
better
than
any
young
lady
he
had
ever
seen
the
trouble
was
that
between
the
two
he
as
he
would
have
expressed
it
did
have
the
peace
of
a
before
elsie
came
a
game
of
checkers
between
perez
and
himself
had
been
the
regular
amusement
now
they
played
whist
captain
eri
and
elsie
against
him
and
his
former
opponent
as
elsie
and
her
partner
almost
invariably
won
and
as
perez
usually
found
fault
with
him
because
they
lost
this
was
not
an
agreeable
change
but
it
was
but
one
he
did
like
muslin
curtains
in
his
bedroom
because
they
were
a
nuisance
when
he
wanted
to
sit
up
in
bed
and
look
out
of
the
window
but
the
curtains
were
put
there
and
everybody
else
seemed
to
think
them
beautiful
so
he
could
not
protest
captain
perez
and
captain
eri
had
taken
to
dressing
up
for
supper
to
the
extent
of
putting
on
neckties
and
clean
collars
also
they
shaved
every
day
he
stuck
to
the
old
plan
for
a
while
but
looked
so
scrubby
by
contrast
that
out
of
mere
he
had
to
follow
suit
obviously
two
females
in
the
house
were
one
too
many
something
had
to
be
done
ralph
hazeltine
frequent
calls
gave
him
the
inspiration
he
was
looking
for
this
was
to
bring
about
a
marriage
between
ralph
and
miss
preston
after
deliberation
he
decided
that
if
this
could
be
done
the
pair
would
live
somewhere
else
even
though
john
baxter
was
still
too
ill
to
be
moved
elsie
could
come
in
every
day
but
she
would
be
too
busy
with
her
own
establishment
to
bother
with
the
improvement
of
theirs
it
a
very
brilliant
plan
and
had
some
vital
objections
but
captain
jerry
considered
it
a
wonder
he
broached
it
to
his
partners
keeping
his
real
object
strictly
in
the
background
and
enlarging
upon
his
great
regard
for
ralph
and
elsie
and
their
obvious
fitness
for
each
other
captain
perez
liked
the
scheme
well
enough
provided
it
could
be
carried
out
captain
eri
seemed
to
think
it
better
to
let
events
take
their
own
course
however
they
both
agreed
to
help
if
the
chance
offered
so
when
hazeltine
called
to
spend
the
evening
captain
jerry
would
rise
from
his
chair
and
with
an
elaborate
cough
and
several
surreptitious
winks
to
his
messmates
would
announce
that
he
guessed
he
would
take
a
little
walk
or
go
out
to
the
barn
or
something
similar
captain
perez
would
more
than
likely
go
also
as
for
captain
eri
he
usually
he
would
step
upstairs
and
see
how
john
was
getting
along
but
in
spite
of
this
loyal
support
the
results
obtained
from
captain
jerry
wonderful
plan
had
not
been
so
startlingly
successful
as
to
warrant
his
feeling
much
elated
ralph
and
elsie
were
good
friends
and
seemed
to
enjoy
each
other
society
but
that
was
all
that
might
be
truthfully
said
so
far
captain
jerry
therefore
was
a
little
discouraged
as
he
sat
in
the
sunshine
and
smoked
and
pondered
he
hid
his
discouragement
however
and
in
response
to
captain
eri
question
concerning
the
progress
of
the
matchmaking
said
cheerfully
oh
it
comin
along
comin
along
kind
of
slow
of
course
but
you
ca
expect
nothin
i
you
noticed
he
was
here
four
times
last
week
why
no
said
captain
eri
i
do
know
i
well
he
was
and
week
a
fore
that
was
only
three
so
that
a
gain
ai
it
i
did
count
the
time
he
stopped
after
a
drink
of
water
neither
that
was
a
real
call
but
oh
it
ought
to
count
for
somethin
call
it
a
a
time
that
would
make
four
times
and
a
he
was
captain
jerry
looked
suspiciously
at
his
friend
face
but
its
soberness
was
irreproachable
so
he
said
well
it
kind
of
slow
work
but
as
i
said
afore
it
comin
along
and
i
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowin
it
all
for
their
yes
like
the
feller
that
ate
all
the
so
his
children
would
have
the
but
say
jerry
i
come
out
to
ask
if
you
mind
bein
housekeeper
luther
davis
has
been
after
me
sence
i
do
know
when
to
come
down
to
the
station
and
stay
to
dinner
his
sister
pashy
the
old
maid
one
is
down
there
and
such
a
fine
day
i
thought
i
take
perez
and
elsie
and
mrs
snow
and
maybe
hazeltine
along
somebody
got
to
stay
with
john
and
i
thought
you
would
i
stay
myself
only
luther
asked
me
so
particular
and
you
was
down
there
two
or
three
months
ago
when
josiah
comes
back
from
school
he
help
you
some
if
you
need
captain
jerry
did
mind
staying
at
home
and
so
eri
went
into
the
house
to
make
arrangements
for
the
proposed
excursion
he
had
some
difficulty
in
persuading
mrs
snow
and
elsie
to
leave
the
sick
man
but
both
were
tired
and
needed
a
rest
and
there
was
a
telephone
at
the
station
so
that
news
of
a
change
in
the
patient
condition
could
be
sent
almost
immediately
under
these
conditions
and
as
captain
jerry
was
certain
to
take
good
care
of
their
charge
the
two
were
persuaded
to
go
perez
took
the
dory
and
rowed
over
to
the
cable
station
to
see
if
hazeltine
cared
to
make
one
of
the
party
when
he
returned
bringing
the
electrician
with
him
daniel
harnessed
to
the
carryall
was
standing
at
the
side
door
and
captain
eri
mrs
snow
and
elsie
were
waiting
ralph
glanced
at
the
carryall
and
then
at
those
who
were
expected
to
occupy
it
i
think
i
better
row
down
captain
he
said
i
do
see
how
five
of
us
are
going
to
find
room
in
what
in
a
carryall
exclaimed
the
captain
why
that
what
a
carryall
for
i
carried
six
in
a
carryall
now
was
a
good
while
ago
though
he
added
with
a
chuckle
when
i
was
younger
i
am
now
squeezin
did
count
in
them
days
if
the
girls
wanted
to
go
to
i
we
can
fix
it
you
and
me
set
on
the
front
seat
and
the
rest
in
back
elsie
ai
a
very
big
package
and
perez
he
sort
of
he
fit
in
anywheres
let
try
it
and
try
it
they
did
while
it
was
true
that
elsie
was
rather
small
mrs
snow
was
distinctly
large
and
how
captain
perez
in
spite
of
his
alleged
elasticity
managed
to
find
room
between
them
is
a
mystery
he
however
announced
that
he
was
all
right
adding
as
a
caution
do
jolt
none
eri
i
kind
of
hangin
on
the
little
aidge
of
i
look
out
for
you
answered
his
friend
picking
up
the
reins
all
ashore
that
goin
ashore
so
long
jerry
git
dap
thousand
dollars
daniel
complacently
accepted
this
testimony
to
his
monetary
worth
and
jogged
out
of
the
yard
fortunately
appearances
do
not
count
for
much
in
orham
except
in
the
summer
and
the
spectacle
of
five
in
a
carryall
is
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
they
turned
into
the
cliff
road
the
finest
thoroughfare
in
town
kept
in
good
condition
for
the
benefit
of
the
cottagers
and
the
boarders
at
the
big
hotel
the
ocean
was
on
the
left
and
from
the
hill
by
the
barry
estate
captain
perez
charge
they
saw
twenty
miles
of
horizon
line
with
craft
of
all
descriptions
scattered
along
it
schooners
there
were
of
all
sizes
from
little
mackerel
seiners
to
big
and
a
tug
with
a
string
of
coal
barges
behind
it
was
so
close
in
that
they
could
make
out
the
connecting
hawsers
a
black
freight
steamer
was
pushing
along
leaving
a
thick
line
of
smoke
like
a
charcoal
mark
on
the
sky
one
was
in
sight
but
far
out
what
do
you
make
of
that
bark
perez
inquired
captain
eri
pointing
to
the
distant
vessel
british
ai
she
captain
perez
leaned
forward
and
peered
from
under
his
hand
french
looks
to
me
he
said
do
think
so
way
she
rigged
looks
like
johnny
bull
look
at
that
guess
you
right
eri
now
i
come
to
notice
it
can
you
make
out
her
flag
wish
i
brought
my
great
scott
man
exclaimed
ralph
what
sort
of
eyes
have
you
got
i
could
tell
whether
she
had
a
flag
or
not
at
this
distance
how
do
you
do
it
to
how
you
brought
up
as
the
goat
said
replied
captain
eri
when
you
at
sea
you
jest
got
to
git
used
to
seein
things
a
good
ways
off
and
knowin
when
you
see
i
remember
one
time
remarked
mrs
snow
that
my
brother
nathan
he
dead
now
was
bound
home
from
hong
kong
fust
mate
on
the
bark
king
was
the
time
of
the
war
and
the
alabama
was
cruisin
lookin
out
for
our
ships
nate
and
the
skipper
a
bangor
man
he
was
was
on
deck
and
they
sighted
a
steamer
a
good
ways
off
the
skipper
spied
her
and
see
she
was
flyin
the
united
states
flag
but
when
nate
got
the
glass
he
took
one
look
and
says
yankee
buntin
do
over
that
english
hull
he
says
you
see
he
knew
she
was
english
build
right
away
so
the
skipper
pulled
down
his
own
flag
and
british
colors
but
no
use
the
steamer
was
the
alabama
sure
enough
and
the
king
was
burned
and
all
hands
took
nate
did
git
home
for
ever
so
long
and
everybody
thought
he
was
this
set
the
captains
going
and
they
told
until
they
came
to
the
road
that
led
down
to
the
beach
beneath
the
lighthouse
bluff
the
lifesaving
station
was
in
plain
sight
now
but
on
the
outer
beach
and
that
was
separated
from
them
by
a
stretch
of
water
well
observed
captain
eri
here
where
we
take
adam
adam
bridge
queried
elsie
puzzled
yes
the
only
kind
he
had
i
git
dap
daniel
what
are
you
waitin
for
left
your
bathin
suit
to
home
then
as
daniel
stepped
rather
gingerly
into
the
clear
water
he
explained
that
at
a
time
ranging
from
three
hours
before
low
tide
to
three
hours
after
one
may
reach
the
outer
beach
at
this
point
by
driving
over
in
an
ordinary
vehicle
the
add
to
this
by
using
a
specially
built
wagon
with
large
wheels
and
a
body
considerably
elevated
well
there
now
exclaimed
the
lady
from
nantucket
as
daniel
splashingly
emerged
on
the
other
side
i
thought
i
done
about
everything
a
body
could
do
with
salt
water
but
i
never
went
ridin
in
it
the
remainder
of
the
way
to
the
station
was
covered
by
daniel
at
a
walk
for
the
wheels
of
the
heavy
carryall
sank
two
inches
or
more
in
the
coarse
sand
as
they
turned
the
road
wound
between
sand
dunes
riven
and
heaped
in
all
sorts
of
queer
shapes
by
the
wind
and
with
clumps
of
the
persevering
beach
grass
clinging
to
their
tops
like
the
last
treasured
tufts
of
hair
on
partially
bald
heads
here
and
there
half
buried
planks
and
fragments
of
spars
showed
relics
of
wrecks
that
had
come
ashore
in
past
winters
five
years
ago
remarked
captain
eri
there
was
six
foot
of
water
where
we
are
now
this
beach
changes
every
winter
one
good
jest
rips
things
loose
over
here
tears
out
a
big
chunk
of
beach
and
makes
a
one
season
and
fills
in
a
deep
hole
and
builds
a
new
shoal
the
next
i
heard
my
father
tell
huckleberries
when
he
was
a
boy
off
where
them
breakers
are
now
good
dry
land
it
was
then
hey
there
luther
ship
ahoy
lute
the
little
brown
station
was
huddled
between
two
there
was
a
small
stable
and
a
henhouse
and
yard
just
behind
it
captain
davis
rawboned
and
waved
a
welcome
to
them
from
the
side
door
spied
you
comin
eri
he
said
in
a
curiously
mild
voice
that
sounded
odd
coming
from
such
a
deep
chest
i
mighty
glad
to
see
you
too
jump
down
and
come
right
in
pashy
be
out
in
a
minute
here
she
is
miss
patience
davis
was
as
plump
as
her
brother
was
tall
she
impressed
one
as
a
comfortable
sort
of
person
captain
eri
did
the
honors
and
everyone
shook
hands
then
they
went
into
the
living
room
of
the
station
what
particularly
struck
mrs
snow
was
the
neatness
of
everything
the
brass
on
the
pump
in
the
sink
shone
like
fire
as
the
sunlight
from
the
window
struck
it
the
floor
was
white
from
scouring
there
were
shelves
on
the
walls
and
on
these
arranged
in
orderly
piles
were
canned
goods
of
all
descriptions
the
table
was
covered
with
a
figured
oilcloth
two
or
three
men
members
of
the
crew
were
seated
in
the
wooden
chairs
along
the
wall
but
rose
as
the
party
came
in
captain
davis
introduced
them
one
after
the
other
perhaps
the
most
striking
characteristic
of
these
men
was
the
quiet
almost
bashful
way
in
which
they
spoke
they
seemed
like
big
boys
as
much
as
anything
and
yet
the
oldest
was
nearly
fifty
ever
been
in
a
station
afore
asked
captain
eri
elsie
had
not
ralph
had
and
so
had
mrs
snow
but
not
for
years
this
is
where
we
keep
the
boat
and
the
rest
of
the
gear
said
captain
davis
opening
a
door
and
leading
the
way
into
a
large
room
them
the
spare
oars
on
the
wall
the
ones
are
in
the
the
boat
itself
was
on
its
carriage
in
the
middle
of
the
room
along
the
walls
on
hooks
hung
the
men
suits
of
oilskins
and
their
the
captain
pointed
out
one
thing
after
another
the
cork
jackets
and
the
gun
for
shooting
the
life
line
across
a
stranded
vessel
the
life
car
hanging
from
the
roof
and
the
breeches
i
do
you
ever
git
me
into
that
thing
said
the
nantucket
lady
decidedly
referring
to
the
buoy
i
do
know
but
i
as
liefs
be
drownded
as
make
sech
a
show
of
took
off
a
bigger
woman
than
you
one
time
said
captain
davis
wife
of
a
portland
skipper
she
was
and
he
was
on
his
fust
in
a
schooner
jest
off
the
stocks
struck
on
the
hog
back
off
here
and
then
drifted
close
in
and
struck
again
we
got
all
the
woman
fust
that
was
the
only
time
we
used
the
buoy
sence
i
been
at
the
station
most
of
the
wrecks
are
too
fur
off
shore
and
we
have
to
git
out
the
he
took
them
upstairs
to
the
men
sleeping
rooms
and
then
up
to
the
little
cupola
on
the
roof
why
do
you
have
windows
on
this
side
of
the
house
asked
elsie
as
they
passed
the
window
on
the
landing
captain
davis
laughed
well
it
is
pretty
nigh
now
he
answered
but
it
when
it
was
put
in
the
sand
did
that
it
blows
like
all
possessed
when
there
a
gale
do
you
mean
that
those
windows
were
ground
that
way
by
the
beach
sand
blowing
against
them
asked
ralph
astonished
sartin
git
a
good
wind
comin
up
the
beach
and
it
fetches
the
sand
with
it
mighty
mean
stuff
to
face
sand
blowin
like
that
is
makes
you
think
you
fightin
a
nest
of
with
the
telescope
in
the
cupola
they
could
see
for
miles
up
and
down
the
beach
and
out
to
sea
an
ocean
tug
bound
toward
boston
was
passing
and
elsie
looking
through
the
glass
saw
the
cook
come
out
of
the
galley
empty
a
pan
over
the
side
and
go
back
again
let
me
look
through
that
a
minute
said
captain
eri
when
the
rest
had
had
their
turn
he
swung
the
glass
around
until
it
pointed
toward
their
home
away
up
the
shore
perez
he
called
anxiously
look
here
quick
captain
perez
hastily
put
his
eye
to
the
glass
and
his
friend
went
on
you
see
our
house
he
said
yes
well
you
see
the
door
notice
that
chair
by
the
side
of
it
yes
what
of
it
well
that
the
rocker
that
elsie
made
the
velvet
cushion
for
i
want
you
to
look
at
the
upper
southeast
corner
of
that
cushion
and
see
if
there
ai
a
cat
hair
there
lorenzo
possessed
to
sleep
in
that
chair
and
oh
you
git
out
indignantly
exclaimed
captain
perez
straightening
up
well
it
was
a
pretty
important
thing
and
i
wanted
to
make
sure
i
left
that
chair
out
there
and
i
knew
what
i
catch
if
any
cat
hairs
got
on
that
cushion
while
i
was
gone
ai
that
so
mrs
snow
the
housekeeper
expressed
her
opinion
that
captain
eri
was
a
case
whatever
that
may
be
they
had
clam
chowder
for
dinner
a
new
england
clam
chowder
made
with
milk
and
crackers
and
clams
with
shells
as
white
as
snow
they
were
what
the
new
yorker
calls
clams
for
a
fulton
market
chowder
is
a
quahaug
soup
to
the
native
of
the
cape
now
that
chowder
was
good
everybody
said
so
and
if
the
proof
of
the
chowder
like
that
of
the
pudding
is
in
the
eating
of
it
this
one
had
a
clear
case
also
there
were
boiled
striped
bass
which
is
good
enough
for
anybody
hot
biscuits
pumpkin
pie
and
preserves
there
was
a
running
fire
of
apologies
from
miss
patience
and
answering
volleys
of
compliments
from
mrs
snow
i
do
see
how
you
make
sech
preserves
miss
davis
exclaimed
the
lady
from
nantucket
i
declare
i
goin
to
ask
you
for
another
sasserful
i
they
the
best
i
ever
well
now
do
you
think
so
i
kind
of
suspected
that
the
plums
was
a
little
mite
too
ripe
you
know
how
is
with
they
got
to
be
put
up
when
they
jest
so
else
they
ai
good
for
much
i
was
at
luther
for
i
do
know
how
long
i
could
git
him
to
go
over
to
the
and
pick
and
i
was
he
let
it
go
too
long
i
only
put
up
jars
of
on
that
account
how
much
sugar
do
you
use
there
was
material
here
for
the
discussion
that
country
housewives
love
and
the
two
ladies
took
advantage
of
it
when
it
was
over
the
female
portion
of
the
company
washed
the
dishes
while
the
men
walked
up
and
down
the
beach
and
smoked
here
they
were
joined
after
a
while
by
the
ladies
for
even
by
the
ocean
it
was
as
mild
as
early
may
and
the
wind
was
merely
bracing
and
had
no
sting
in
it
the
big
blue
waves
shouldered
themselves
up
from
the
bosom
of
the
sea
marched
toward
the
beach
and
tumbled
to
pieces
in
a
roaring
tumult
of
white
and
green
the
gulls
skimmed
along
their
tops
or
dropped
like
falling
stones
into
the
water
after
sand
eels
emerging
again
screaming
to
repeat
the
performance
the
conversation
naturally
turned
to
wrecks
and
captain
davis
his
reserve
vanishing
before
the
tactful
inquiries
of
the
captains
and
ralph
talked
shop
and
talked
it
well
chapter
xi
heroes
and
a
mystery
luther
davis
had
been
commandant
at
the
station
for
years
and
number
one
man
before
that
so
his
experience
with
wrecks
and
disabled
craft
of
all
kinds
had
been
long
and
varied
he
told
them
of
disasters
the
details
of
which
had
been
telegraphed
all
over
the
country
and
of
rescues
of
crews
from
schooners
whose
signals
of
distress
had
been
seen
from
the
observatory
on
the
roof
of
the
station
he
told
of
long
rows
in
midwinter
through
seas
the
spray
of
which
turned
to
ice
as
they
struck
and
froze
the
men
mittens
to
the
he
told
of
picking
up
draggled
corpses
in
the
surf
at
midnight
when
as
he
said
you
could
tell
whether
was
a
man
or
a
roll
of
seaweed
and
the
only
way
to
make
sure
was
to
reach
down
and
captain
eri
left
them
after
a
while
as
he
had
some
acquaintances
among
the
men
at
the
station
and
wished
to
talk
with
them
miss
davis
remembered
that
she
had
not
fed
the
chickens
and
hurried
away
to
perform
that
humane
duty
gallantly
escorted
by
captain
perez
the
captain
by
the
way
was
apparently
much
taken
with
the
plump
spinster
and
although
usually
rather
bashful
where
ladies
were
concerned
had
managed
to
keep
up
a
sort
of
side
conversation
with
miss
patience
while
the
storytelling
was
going
on
but
ralph
and
elsie
and
mrs
snow
were
hungry
for
more
tales
and
captain
davis
obligingly
told
them
one
of
the
wust
wrecks
we
ever
had
off
here
he
said
was
the
bluebell
british
ship
she
was
from
singapore
bound
to
boston
and
loaded
with
hemp
we
see
her
about
off
that
there
jest
at
dusk
and
she
was
makin
heavy
weather
then
it
come
on
to
snow
soon
as
it
got
dark
and
blow
do
talk
seems
to
me
was
one
of
the
meanest
nights
i
ever
saw
the
snow
flyin
and
the
dark
you
could
see
two
feet
ahead
of
you
we
was
kind
of
worried
about
the
vessel
all
evenin
for
one
thing
she
was
too
close
in
shore
when
we
see
her
last
but
there
nothin
to
be
done
except
to
keep
a
weather
eye
out
for
signs
of
trouble
fust
thing
we
knew
of
the
wreck
was
when
the
man
on
patrol
up
the
beach
philander
vose
was
telephoned
from
the
shanty
that
a
had
come
ashore
at
knowles
cove
two
mile
above
the
station
that
was
about
one
in
the
mornin
two
sim
gould
he
was
drownded
the
next
summer
fishin
on
the
banks
telephoned
from
the
shanty
below
the
station
the
one
a
mile
or
so
side
of
the
cable
house
hazeltine
that
wreckage
was
washin
up
abreast
of
where
he
was
that
was
six
miles
from
where
the
longboat
come
ashore
so
there
we
was
there
any
way
of
tellin
whereabouts
she
was
layin
she
might
have
been
anywheres
along
them
six
miles
and
you
could
hear
nothin
nor
see
nothin
but
anyhow
the
wreckage
kept
comin
in
below
the
cable
station
so
i
jedged
she
was
somewheres
in
that
neighborhood
and
we
got
the
boat
out
on
the
cart
of
course
and
hauled
it
down
there
was
a
tremendous
job
too
that
haulin
was
we
had
the
horse
and
the
whole
of
us
helpin
him
but
i
swan
i
begun
to
think
we
never
git
anywheres
the
wind
and
the
sand
and
the
snow
i
thought
we
flap
to
pieces
like
a
passel
of
shirts
on
a
clothes
line
but
we
got
there
after
a
spell
and
then
there
was
nothin
to
do
but
wait
for
daylight
seven
the
snow
let
up
a
little
bit
and
then
we
see
her
there
was
a
bar
jest
about
opposite
the
cable
station
it
been
washed
away
sence
and
she
struck
on
that
and
the
sea
was
makin
a
clean
breach
over
her
there
was
a
a
dozen
of
her
crew
lashed
in
the
riggin
but
i
did
see
move
so
i
presume
likely
they
was
froze
stiff
then
for
was
perishin
cold
but
we
wrastled
the
boat
down
to
the
water
and
was
jest
goin
to
launch
her
when
the
whole
three
masts
went
by
the
men
and
all
we
put
off
to
her
but
she
was
in
a
soapsuds
of
a
sea
and
awash
from
stem
to
stern
so
we
knew
there
was
nothin
livin
aboard
yes
siree
continued
the
captain
meditatively
that
was
a
mean
night
i
had
this
ear
and
it
been
tender
ever
sence
one
of
the
fellers
had
a
rib
broke
he
was
a
little
light
chap
and
the
wind
jest
slammed
him
up
against
the
cart
like
as
if
he
was
a
chip
and
jest
to
show
you
he
added
how
the
tide
runs
around
this
place
the
bodies
of
that
crew
was
picked
up
from
wellmouth
to
setuckit
stretch
that
is
the
skipper
body
never
come
ashore
he
had
a
son
nice
young
feller
that
was
goin
to
meet
him
in
boston
and
that
boy
spent
a
month
down
here
waitin
for
his
father
body
to
be
washed
up
he
walk
up
and
down
this
beach
and
walk
up
and
down
pitiful
sight
as
ever
i
and
they
were
all
lost
asked
elsie
with
a
shiver
every
man
jack
but
was
about
that
hemp
the
bluebell
was
loaded
with
it
as
i
told
you
and
when
she
went
to
pieces
the
tide
took
that
hemp
and
strung
it
from
here
to
glory
they
picked
it
up
all
and
for
much
as
a
month
afterwards
you
go
along
the
road
over
in
the
village
and
see
it
hung
over
fences
or
spread
out
in
the
sun
to
dry
looked
like
all
the
blonde
girls
in
creation
had
had
a
captain
davis
said
ralph
you
must
have
seen
some
plucky
things
in
your
life
what
was
the
bravest
thing
you
ever
saw
done
the
life
saver
took
the
cigar
that
hazeltine
had
given
him
from
his
mouth
and
blew
the
smoke
into
the
air
over
his
head
well
he
said
slowly
i
do
know
exactly
i
seen
some
pretty
gritty
things
done
here
in
the
service
when
somebody
drowndin
and
you
know
there
a
chance
to
save
take
chances
and
think
nothin
of
that
you
would
take
if
you
had
time
to
set
down
and
a
little
i
see
somethin
done
once
that
may
not
strike
you
as
bein
anything
out
of
the
usual
run
but
that
has
always
seemed
to
me
clear
grit
and
nothin
else
life
neither
was
jest
a
matter
of
it
happened
up
off
the
coast
of
maine
in
the
seventies
i
was
actin
as
sort
of
second
mate
on
a
lumber
schooner
was
a
night
or
mornin
rather
six
blowin
like
all
possessed
and
colder
greenland
we
struck
a
rock
that
even
down
on
an
eldredge
chart
and
punched
a
hole
in
the
schooner
side
jest
above
what
ought
to
have
been
the
water
line
only
she
was
heeled
over
so
that
below
it
most
of
the
time
we
had
a
mean
crew
aboard
portugees
mainly
and
poor
ones
at
that
the
skipper
was
below
asleep
and
when
he
come
on
deck
things
was
in
a
bad
way
we
got
the
canvas
off
her
but
she
was
takin
in
water
every
time
she
rolled
and
there
was
a
sea
goin
that
was
tearin
things
loose
in
great
shape
we
shipped
one
old
grayback
that
ripped
off
a
strip
of
the
lee
rail
jest
the
same
as
you
rip
the
edge
off
the
cover
of
a
pasteboard
box
never
made
no
more
fuss
about
it
either
i
did
see
nothin
to
do
but
get
out
the
boats
but
the
skipper
he
that
kind
he
sized
things
up
in
a
hurry
i
tell
you
he
drove
the
crew
of
was
prayin
to
the
virgin
and
swearin
a
blue
streak
to
the
pumps
and
set
me
over
with
a
revolver
to
keep
workin
then
him
and
the
fust
mate
and
one
or
two
of
the
best
hands
rousted
out
a
spare
sail
weighted
one
edge
of
it
to
keep
it
down
and
got
it
over
the
side
made
fast
of
course
then
him
and
the
mate
stripped
to
their
underclothes
rigged
a
sort
of
chair
over
where
the
hole
in
the
side
was
took
hammers
and
a
pocketful
of
nails
apiece
and
started
in
to
nail
that
canvas
over
the
hole
was
freezin
cold
and
the
old
schooner
was
rollin
like
a
washtub
one
minute
i
see
the
skipper
and
the
mate
up
in
the
air
hammerin
for
dear
life
and
then
swash
under
they
go
clear
under
and
stay
there
seemed
to
me
forever
every
dip
i
thought
would
be
the
end
and
i
shet
my
eyes
expectin
to
see
gone
when
she
lifted
but
no
up
they
come
fetch
a
breath
shake
the
salt
water
out
of
their
eyes
and
go
to
work
again
four
hours
and
a
quarter
they
was
at
it
four
hours
mind
you
and
under
water
a
good
of
the
time
but
they
got
that
sail
nailed
fast
we
got
on
deck
when
was
done
and
we
had
to
carry
the
fust
mate
to
the
cabin
but
the
skipper
jest
sent
the
cook
for
a
pail
of
bilin
hot
coffee
drunk
the
whole
of
it
put
on
dry
clothes
over
his
wet
flannels
and
stayed
on
deck
and
worked
that
schooner
into
portland
harbor
the
men
pumpin
clear
green
water
out
of
the
hold
every
minute
of
the
way
now
that
always
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
reel
thing
a
question
of
savin
life
we
could
have
took
to
the
boats
and
nine
chances
out
of
ten
got
ashore
all
right
for
very
fur
but
no
the
skipper
said
he
never
lost
a
vessel
for
an
owner
yit
and
he
goin
to
lose
this
one
and
he
did
either
by
judas
no
sir
that
was
splendid
exclaimed
elsie
i
should
like
to
have
known
that
captain
who
was
he
captain
davis
well
the
fust
mate
was
obed
simmons
he
dead
now
but
he
used
to
live
over
on
the
road
towards
east
harniss
the
skipper
well
he
was
a
feller
you
was
eri
said
mrs
snow
with
conviction
that
right
perez
told
you
i
no
nobody
told
me
i
jest
guessed
it
i
seen
a
good
many
folks
in
my
time
and
i
i
got
so
i
can
tell
what
kind
a
man
is
after
i
known
him
a
little
while
i
jedged
eri
was
that
kind
and
when
you
said
we
knew
that
skipper
i
was
almost
sartin
was
well
exclaimed
ralph
i
do
believe
i
should
have
guessed
it
i
always
liked
the
captain
but
he
has
seemed
so
full
of
fun
and
so
that
i
never
thought
of
his
doing
anything
quite
so
captain
davis
laughed
i
seen
hands
try
to
take
advantage
of
that
way
now
he
said
but
they
never
did
it
but
once
eri
is
one
of
the
finest
fellers
that
ever
stepped
but
you
ca
stomp
on
his
toes
much
and
he
clear
grit
inside
and
say
he
added
do
you
tell
anybody
i
told
that
story
for
he
skin
me
alive
if
he
knew
as
they
walked
back
toward
the
station
ralph
and
elsie
lingered
a
little
behind
the
others
and
then
stopped
to
watch
a
big
that
under
full
sail
was
spinning
along
a
mile
or
two
from
the
beach
they
watched
it
for
a
moment
or
two
without
speaking
elsie
cheeks
were
brown
from
the
sun
stray
wisps
of
her
hair
fluttered
in
the
wind
and
her
trim
healthy
figure
stood
out
against
the
white
sandhill
behind
them
as
if
cut
from
cardboard
the
electrician
looked
at
her
and
again
the
thought
of
that
disgraceful
black
episode
was
forced
into
his
mind
they
had
had
many
a
good
laugh
over
it
since
and
elsie
had
apparently
forgotten
it
but
he
had
not
by
a
good
deal
she
was
the
first
to
speak
and
then
as
much
to
herself
as
to
him
i
think
they
are
the
best
people
i
ever
knew
she
said
who
he
asked
oh
all
of
them
the
captains
and
mrs
snow
and
captain
davis
and
his
sister
they
are
so
simple
and
kind
and
generous
and
the
best
of
it
is
they
do
seem
to
know
it
and
would
believe
it
if
you
told
ralph
nodded
emphatically
i
imagine
it
would
take
a
good
deal
to
convince
davis
or
any
of
these
station
men
that
there
was
anything
heroic
in
their
lives
he
said
as
for
captain
eri
i
have
known
him
only
a
month
or
two
but
i
do
know
of
anyone
to
whom
i
would
rather
go
if
i
were
in
he
has
been
so
kind
to
grandfather
and
me
said
elsie
that
i
feel
as
though
we
were
under
an
obligation
we
never
could
repay
when
i
came
down
here
i
knew
no
one
in
orham
and
he
and
captain
jerry
and
captain
perez
have
made
me
feel
more
at
home
than
i
have
ever
felt
before
you
know
she
added
grandfather
is
the
only
relative
i
i
suppose
you
will
go
back
to
your
studies
when
your
grandfather
i
do
know
if
grandfather
is
well
enough
i
think
i
shall
try
to
persuade
him
to
come
up
to
boston
and
live
with
me
then
i
might
perhaps
teach
this
was
to
have
been
my
last
year
at
radcliffe
so
my
giving
it
up
will
not
make
so
much
difference
do
you
intend
to
stay
here
long
i
suppose
you
do
your
profession
i
know
means
so
much
to
you
and
your
work
at
the
station
must
be
very
it
would
be
more
so
if
i
had
someone
who
was
interested
with
me
langley
is
kind
but
he
is
so
wrapped
up
in
his
own
work
that
i
see
very
little
of
him
i
took
the
place
because
i
thought
it
would
give
me
a
good
deal
of
spare
time
that
i
might
use
in
furthering
some
experiments
of
my
own
electricity
is
my
hobby
and
i
have
one
or
two
ideas
that
i
am
foolish
enough
to
hope
may
be
worth
developing
i
have
had
time
enough
goodness
knows
but
it
a
lonesome
sort
of
life
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
captains
and
you
i
think
i
should
have
given
it
up
before
oh
i
hope
you
why
why
why
because
it
seems
like
running
away
almost
does
it
if
a
thing
is
hard
to
do
but
is
worth
doing
i
think
the
satisfaction
in
doing
it
is
ever
so
much
greater
do
you
i
know
it
must
be
lonely
for
you
but
then
it
is
lonely
for
langley
and
the
other
men
i
doubt
if
langley
would
be
happy
anywhere
else
and
the
other
men
are
married
most
of
them
and
live
over
in
the
now
there
is
any
real
reason
why
this
simple
remark
should
have
caused
a
halt
in
the
conversation
but
it
did
miss
preston
said
oh
indeed
rather
hurriedly
and
her
next
speech
was
concerning
the
height
of
a
particularly
big
wave
hazeltine
answered
this
commonplace
somewhat
he
acted
like
a
man
to
whom
a
startling
idea
had
suddenly
occurred
just
then
they
heard
captain
eri
calling
them
the
captain
was
standing
on
a
sand
dune
near
the
station
shouting
their
names
through
a
speaking
trumpet
formed
by
placing
his
hands
about
his
mouth
as
the
pair
came
strolling
toward
him
he
shifted
his
hands
to
his
trousers
pockets
and
stood
watching
the
young
couple
with
a
sort
of
half
smile
i
if
jerry
was
here
now
he
mused
he
think
his
scheme
was
workin
well
maybe
is
maybe
is
you
ca
never
tell
well
i
swan
the
exclamation
was
called
forth
by
the
sight
of
captain
perez
and
miss
patience
who
suddenly
came
into
view
around
the
corner
of
the
station
the
captain
was
gallantly
assisting
his
companion
over
the
rough
places
in
the
path
and
she
was
leaning
upon
his
arm
in
a
manner
that
implied
implicit
confidence
captain
eri
glanced
from
one
couple
to
the
other
and
then
grinned
broadly
the
grin
had
not
entirely
disappeared
when
captain
perez
came
up
and
the
latter
rather
crisply
asked
what
the
joke
was
oh
nothin
was
the
reply
i
was
jest
thinkin
we
must
be
some
kind
of
a
game
and
i
was
it
queried
miss
patience
puzzled
why
yes
i
kinder
like
bailey
used
to
be
at
the
dances
when
you
and
me
was
younger
perez
old
man
alexander
he
was
the
fiddler
used
to
sing
out
partners
for
hull
or
somethin
like
that
and
it
always
took
so
long
to
make
up
his
mind
what
girl
to
choose
that
he
got
left
altogether
then
set
on
the
settee
all
through
the
dance
and
say
he
never
cared
much
for
hull
anyway
seems
to
me
i
the
only
one
that
ai
choosed
partners
how
it
perez
more
fool
you
that
all
i
got
to
say
replied
captain
perez
stoutly
miss
patience
laughed
so
heartily
at
this
rejoinder
that
perez
began
to
think
he
had
said
a
very
good
thing
indeed
and
so
repeated
it
for
greater
effect
you
want
to
look
out
for
him
miss
davis
said
captain
eri
he
the
most
fascinatin
youngster
of
his
age
i
ever
see
me
and
jerry
been
thinkin
we
have
to
build
a
fence
the
house
to
keep
the
girls
away
when
he
home
why
busteed
fairly
oh
give
us
a
rest
eri
exclaimed
perez
with
even
more
indignation
than
was
necessary
busteed
just
then
ralph
and
elsie
came
up
and
captain
eri
explained
that
he
had
hailed
them
because
it
was
time
to
be
going
if
they
wanted
to
get
across
to
the
mainland
without
swimming
they
walked
around
to
the
back
door
of
the
station
and
there
found
mrs
snow
and
captain
davis
by
the
the
lady
from
nantucket
had
discovered
a
sick
chicken
in
the
collection
and
she
was
holding
it
in
her
lap
and
at
the
same
time
discoursing
learnedly
on
the
relative
value
of
plymouth
rocks
and
rhode
island
reds
as
layers
see
there
exclaimed
captain
eri
delightedly
pointing
to
the
suffering
pullet
what
did
i
tell
you
wonder
we
picked
her
out
for
nuss
for
john
luther
even
a
sick
hen
knows
enough
to
go
to
they
harnessed
daniel
to
the
carryall
and
stowed
the
living
freight
aboard
somehow
although
captain
perez
protested
that
he
had
eaten
so
much
dinner
he
did
know
he
be
able
to
hang
on
the
way
he
did
coming
down
then
they
said
farewell
to
captain
davis
and
his
sister
and
started
for
home
the
members
of
the
crew
such
of
them
as
were
about
the
station
waved
to
them
as
they
passed
things
kind
of
average
up
in
this
world
do
they
said
captain
eri
reflectively
as
he
steered
daniel
along
the
soft
beach
toward
the
ford
we
all
the
time
readin
fellers
that
work
for
the
gittin
high
and
doin
next
to
nothin
now
there
a
gang
the
crew
i
mean
that
does
what
you
and
me
would
call
almighty
hard
work
and
git
next
to
nothin
for
it
uncle
sam
gits
square
there
it
seems
to
me
a
few
dollars
a
month
and
find
yourself
ai
wages
for
bein
froze
and
drownded
and
blown
to
pieces
ten
months
out
of
the
year
is
it
the
tide
was
higher
when
they
came
to
the
crossing
than
it
had
been
when
they
drove
over
before
but
they
made
the
passage
all
right
although
there
was
some
nervousness
displayed
by
the
feminine
portion
of
the
party
when
they
reached
home
they
found
captain
jerry
contentedly
smoking
his
pipe
the
sick
man
was
asleep
and
everything
was
serene
josiah
appeared
from
behind
the
barn
where
he
had
been
smoking
a
cigarette
they
pressed
hazeltine
to
stay
to
supper
but
he
declined
alleging
that
he
had
been
away
from
business
too
long
already
he
had
been
remarkably
silent
during
the
homeward
ride
and
elsie
too
had
seemed
busy
with
her
thoughts
she
was
full
of
fun
at
the
supper
table
however
and
the
meal
was
a
jolly
one
just
as
it
was
finished
captain
jerry
struck
the
table
a
bang
with
his
palm
that
made
the
knives
and
forks
jump
and
so
startled
captain
perez
as
to
cause
him
to
spill
half
a
cup
of
tea
over
his
shirt
bosom
land
of
love
ejaculated
the
victim
mopping
his
chin
and
his
tie
with
his
napkin
it
bad
enough
to
scare
a
feller
to
death
let
alone
drowndin
and
scaldin
him
at
the
same
time
what
did
you
do
that
for
i
jest
thought
of
somethin
exclaimed
captain
jerry
going
through
one
pocket
after
the
other
well
i
wish
you
have
your
thinkin
fits
in
the
barn
or
somewheres
else
next
time
i
put
this
shirt
on
clean
this
mornin
and
now
look
at
it
his
friend
was
too
busy
to
pay
any
attention
to
this
advice
the
pocket
search
apparently
being
unsatisfactory
he
rose
from
the
table
and
hurriedly
made
a
round
of
the
room
looking
on
the
mantelpiece
and
under
chairs
i
had
it
when
i
come
in
he
soliloquized
i
know
i
did
i
was
wearin
it
when
i
went
out
to
see
to
the
hens
i
do
see
where
if
it
your
hat
you
looking
for
observed
josiah
i
saw
mrs
snow
hang
it
up
on
the
nail
behind
the
door
there
it
is
the
reply
to
this
was
merely
a
grunt
which
may
or
may
not
have
expressed
approval
at
any
rate
the
hat
was
apparently
the
object
of
his
search
for
he
took
it
from
the
nail
looked
inside
and
with
a
sigh
of
relief
took
out
a
crumpled
envelope
i
knew
i
put
it
somewheres
he
said
it
a
letter
for
you
elsie
josiah
here
he
brought
it
down
from
the
when
he
come
from
school
this
afternoon
i
meant
to
give
it
to
you
captain
eri
who
sat
next
to
the
young
lady
noticed
that
the
envelope
was
addressed
in
an
irregular
sprawling
hand
to
miss
elizabeth
preston
orham
elsie
looked
it
over
in
the
absent
way
in
which
so
many
of
us
examine
the
outside
of
a
letter
which
comes
unexpectedly
i
wonder
who
it
is
from
she
said
she
did
not
open
it
at
once
but
tucking
it
into
her
waist
announced
that
she
must
run
upstairs
in
order
that
mrs
snow
might
come
down
to
supper
the
housekeeper
did
come
down
a
few
minutes
later
and
as
she
was
interested
to
know
more
about
luther
davis
and
his
sister
the
talk
became
animated
and
general
it
was
after
eight
when
mrs
snow
having
finished
washing
the
dishes
she
allowed
no
one
to
assist
her
in
this
operation
since
the
time
when
she
caught
captain
jerry
using
the
dust
rag
instead
of
the
dishcloth
went
upstairs
to
her
patient
shortly
afterward
elsie
came
down
wearing
her
hat
and
jacket
i
going
out
for
a
little
while
she
said
no
i
do
want
anyone
to
go
with
me
i
be
back
her
back
was
turned
to
the
three
captains
as
she
spoke
but
as
she
opened
the
door
the
lamplight
shone
for
an
instant
on
her
face
and
captain
eri
noticed
or
fancied
that
he
did
that
she
was
paler
than
usual
he
rose
and
again
offered
to
accompany
her
but
met
with
such
a
firm
refusal
that
he
could
not
insist
further
now
that
kind
of
funny
ai
it
remarked
perez
i
do
she
been
out
alone
afore
after
dark
sence
she
been
where
did
you
git
that
letter
josiah
asked
captain
eri
it
may
as
well
be
explained
here
that
captain
perez
was
a
thorn
in
the
flesh
to
everyone
including
his
indulgent
relative
he
was
a
little
afraid
of
mrs
snow
and
obeyed
her
better
than
he
did
anyone
else
but
that
is
not
saying
a
great
deal
he
was
in
mischief
in
school
of
the
time
and
his
reports
made
out
by
the
teacher
were
anything
but
complimentary
he
was
a
boy
the
image
of
his
mother
who
had
been
her
uncle
favorite
and
he
was
popular
with
a
certain
class
of
youngsters
also
and
this
was
worse
his
work
at
the
livery
stable
had
thrown
him
in
contact
with
a
crowd
of
men
like
squealer
wixon
web
saunders
and
others
of
their
class
and
they
appreciated
his
new
york
street
training
and
made
much
of
him
captain
perez
mindful
of
his
promise
to
the
boy
mother
did
not
use
the
necessary
measures
to
control
him
and
captain
eri
and
captain
jerry
did
not
like
to
interfere
just
now
he
was
seated
in
the
corner
and
he
looked
up
with
a
start
hurriedly
folded
up
the
tattered
paper
book
he
was
reading
stuffed
it
into
his
pocket
and
said
what
who
give
you
that
letter
that
come
for
elsie
miss
cahoon
up
at
the
office
it
was
in
our
box
said
the
boy
humph
what
are
you
readin
that
so
interestin
oh
nothin
a
book
that
let
me
look
at
josiah
hesitated
looked
as
if
he
would
like
to
refuse
and
then
sullenly
took
the
ragged
volume
from
his
pocket
and
handed
it
to
the
captain
who
deliberately
unfolded
it
and
looked
at
the
cover
fred
starlight
the
boy
rover
of
the
pacific
he
read
aloud
humph
is
it
good
bet
your
life
it
a
i
want
to
know
who
was
moonshine
what
his
name
starlight
he
was
a
sailor
was
the
sulky
answer
josiah
was
no
fool
and
knew
when
he
was
being
made
fun
of
the
captain
opened
the
book
and
read
a
page
or
two
to
himself
then
he
said
i
see
he
knocked
the
skipper
down
he
insulted
him
nice
spunky
chap
i
like
to
have
had
him
aboard
a
vessel
of
mine
and
he
called
the
old
man
a
hound
awful
thing
to
call
a
feller
that
is
i
bet
that
skipper
felt
ashamed
looks
like
a
good
book
borrow
it
to
read
while
you
doin
your
i
ai
got
any
lessons
to
oh
ai
you
i
thought
that
was
a
over
well
i
know
now
besides
you

got
any
right
to
order
me
around
you
ai
my
uncle
ca
i
read
that
book
uncle
perez
poor
perez
he
hesitated
swallowed
once
or
twice
and
answered
you
can
read
it
after
you
studied
a
spell
you
let
him
have
it
then
wo
you
eri
now
study
like
a
good
captain
eri
looked
as
if
he
would
like
to
say
something
further
but
he
evidently
thought
better
of
it
and
tossed
the
paper
novel
across
to
captain
perez
who
put
it
on
the
table
saying
rather
feebly
there
now
it
right
there
where
you
can
have
it
soon
your
examples
now
pitch
in
so
the
teacher
can
see
how
smart
you
his
nephew
grumblingly
got
his
paper
and
pencil
took
the
arithmetic
and
went
to
work
no
one
spoke
for
a
while
captain
perez
twirling
his
thumbs
and
looking
as
he
felt
uncomfortable
soon
josiah
announcing
that
his
studies
were
completed
grabbed
the
novel
from
the
table
took
a
lamp
from
the
kitchen
and
went
off
to
bed
when
he
had
gone
captain
jerry
said
perez
you
that
i
i
am
i
i
am
but
i
ca
bear
to
be
cross
to
him
somehow
poor
lizzie
she
made
me
promise
i
would
be
and
i
jest
ca
that
all
you
understand
how
is
do
you
eri
the
captain
nodded
i
understand
he
said
i
sorry
i
said
anything
i
had
ought
to
be
givin
orders
what
none
of
my
affairs
what
time
is
it
gittin
to
be
captain
jerry
announced
that
it
was
bedtime
and
that
he
was
going
to
turn
in
perez
still
looking
worried
and
anxious
said
that
he
also
was
going
to
bed
captain
eri
thought
that
he
would
sit
up
for
a
while
another
hour
and
still
another
went
by
and
the
captain
sat
there
in
his
rocker
his
two
friends
were
sound
asleep
mrs
snow
called
twice
from
the
head
of
the
stairs
to
know
if
elsie
had
come
back
and
where
on
earth
she
could
be
captain
eri
answers
were
cheery
and
to
the
effect
that
the
young
lady
had
an
errand
up
town
and
would
be
home
pretty
soon
he
guessed
nevertheless
it
might
have
been
noticed
that
he
glanced
at
the
clock
every
few
minutes
and
grew
more
and
more
fidgety
it
was
after
eleven
when
elsie
came
in
she
hurriedly
and
with
some
confusion
apologized
for
being
so
late
and
thanked
the
captain
for
sitting
up
for
her
she
made
no
offer
to
explain
her
long
absence
and
as
she
went
upstairs
captain
eri
noticed
that
her
face
was
if
anything
paler
than
when
she
went
out
and
her
eyes
looked
as
if
she
had
been
crying
he
wanted
to
ask
her
some
questions
but
did
because
she
evidently
did
not
wish
to
talk
he
pondered
over
the
matter
while
undressing
and
for
a
long
time
after
that
lay
awake
thinking
that
the
girl
was
in
trouble
of
some
sort
was
plain
but
he
could
not
understand
why
she
said
nothing
about
it
or
what
its
cause
might
be
she
had
been
her
bright
happy
self
all
day
and
a
part
of
the
evening
then
she
had
suddenly
changed
the
captain
wondered
what
was
in
that
letter
chapter
xii
a
little
politics
elsie
when
she
came
down
to
breakfast
next
morning
was
quieter
than
usual
and
to
the
joking
questions
of
captain
jerry
and
captain
perez
who
were
curious
concerning
her
errand
of
the
previous
evening
and
who
pretended
to
believe
that
she
had
gone
to
a
dance
or
time
with
some
feller
unknown
she
gave
evasive
but
replies
captain
eri
was
on
his
usual
fishing
trip
and
after
breakfast
was
over
perez
departed
to
the
barry
place
and
jerry
to
his
beloved
schoolhouse
the
sacrifice
whose
impending
matrimonial
doom
had
not
been
mentioned
for
some
time
by
the
trio
interested
was
gradually
becoming
his
own
garrulous
self
and
his
principal
topic
of
conversation
recently
had
been
the
coming
marriage
of
the
upstairs
teacher
that
is
the
lady
who
presided
over
the
grammar
grade
of
the
school
and
the
question
of
her
probable
successor
in
fact
this
question
of
who
the
new
teacher
was
to
be
was
the
prevailing
subject
of
surmise
and
conjecture
in
the
village
just
then
when
captain
jerry
came
back
to
the
house
he
went
out
to
the
barn
to
feed
lorenzo
and
the
hens
and
attend
to
daniel
toilet
he
was
busy
with
the
when
elsie
came
in
she
seated
herself
on
a
box
and
watched
the
performance
for
a
while
without
speaking
the
captain
who
took
this
part
of
his
duties
very
seriously
was
too
intent
on
crimping
daniel
rather
scraggy
forelock
to
talk
much
at
length
miss
preston
broke
the
silence
captain
jerry
she
said
you
have
never
told
me
just
where
you
found
grandfather
that
night
when
he
was
taken
sick
on
the
hill
back
of
the
was
it
yes
jest
on
the
top
you
see
he
fell
down
when
he
was
runnin
to
the
captain
eri
found
him
did
he
yep
whoa
there
stand
still
ca
you
yes
eri
found
how
was
he
dressed
who
john
oh
he
was
bareheaded
and
in
his
shirtsleeves
jest
as
he
run
outdoors
when
he
heard
the
bell
queer
he
did
put
on
that
old
white
hat
of
his
i
never
knew
him
to
be
without
it
afore
but
a
feller
to
forgit
anything
a
night
like
that
was
did
eri
tell
you
how
perez
forgot
his
shoes
funniest
thing
i
ever
see
that
he
began
the
story
of
his
friend
but
his
companion
did
not
seem
to
pay
much
attention
to
it
in
fact
it
was
evident
that
her
thoughts
were
somewhere
else
for
when
the
captain
asked
her
a
question
that
plainly
called
for
a
negative
she
replied
yes
very
calmly
and
did
seem
to
know
that
she
had
said
it
she
went
into
the
house
soon
after
and
captain
jerry
after
considering
the
matter
decided
that
she
was
probably
thinking
of
hazeltine
he
derived
much
comfort
from
the
idea
when
he
too
entered
the
dining
room
elsie
said
to
him
oh
captain
jerry
please
do
tell
the
others
that
i
asked
about
grandfather
they
would
think
that
i
was
worrying
and
i
not
a
bit
you
wo
mention
it
will
you
just
promise
to
please
so
the
captain
promised
although
he
did
not
understand
why
it
was
asked
of
him
when
captain
eri
came
home
that
afternoon
and
was
cleaning
his
catch
at
the
shanty
he
was
surprised
to
receive
a
call
from
miss
preston
hello
he
exclaimed
come
to
the
trade
elsie
smiled
and
disclaimed
any
intention
of
apprenticeship
captain
eri
she
said
i
want
to
have
a
talk
with
you
a
business
the
captain
looked
at
her
keenly
all
he
said
however
was
you
tell
me
yes
i
want
to
talk
with
you
about
getting
me
a
a
position
yes
i
been
thinking
a
great
deal
lately
and
now
that
grandfather
seems
to
be
a
little
better
and
i
not
needed
to
help
take
care
of
him
i
want
to
do
something
to
earn
my
earn
your
livin
why

do
that

mite
of

but
what

little

in
a
while

to

when
he

but
i
do
want
to
use
your
money
or

captain
eri
you
do
know
what
he
has
done
for
me
ever
since
i
was
a
little
girl
he
has
clothed
me
and

kind
and
good
that
now
that
he
is
ill
and
helpless
i
simply
ca
go
on
using
his
money
i
ca
and
i
the
tears
stood
in
the
girl
eyes
as
she
spoke
and
the
captain
noticing
her
emotion
thought
it
better
to
treat
the
matter
seriously
for
the
present
at
any
rate
all
right
he
said
shows
a
proper
sperit
and
saves
grocery
bills
as
old
man
scudder
said
when
his
wife
run
off
with
the
what
kind
of
a
place
was
you
thinkin
of
takin
i
want
to
get
the

to
teach
in
the
grammar
school
here
miss

going
to
be
married
and
when
she
leaves
i
want
her
place
and
i
want
you
to
help
me
get
captain
eri
whistled
i
want
to
know
he
exclaimed
then
he
said
look
here
elsie
i
do
want
you
to
think
i
tryin
to
be
your
affairs
or
anything
like
that
but
are
you
sure
there
some
reason
more
you
told
me
of
for
your
wantin
this
place
i
ai
no
real
relation
of
yours
you
understand
but
i
would
like
to
have
you
feel
that
you
could
come
to
me
with
your
troubles
jest
the
same
as
you
would
to
your
grandpa
now
honest
and
true
ai
there
somethin
back
of
this
it
was
only
for
a
moment
that
elsie
hesitated
but
that
hesitation
and
the
manner
in
which
she
answered
went
far
toward
confirming
the
captain
suspicions
no
captain
eri
she
said
it
is
just
as
i
told
you
i
do
want
to
be
dependent
on
grandfather
any
and
there
ai
a
single
other
reason
for
of
course
i
ought
to
mind
my
business
but
well
there
what
was
it
you
wanted
me
to
do
help
you
git
the
place
yes
if
you
will
i
know
captain
perez
has
said
that
you
were
interested
in
the
and
helped
to
nominate
some
of
the
selectmen
and
the
so
i
thought
perhaps
if
you
used
your
influence
you
might
get
the
position
for
well
i
do
know
i
did
do
a
little
electioneerin
for
one
or
two
fellers
and
maybe
they
ought
to
be
willin
to
do
somethin
for
me
still
you
ca
never
tell
a
cat
jump
over
your
hands
if
she
knows
there
a
piece
of
fish
comin
afterwards
but
when
she
swallowed
that
fish
it
a
job
altogether
same
way
with
a
politician
but
then
you
let
me
think
over
it
for
a
spell
and
see
you
think
it
over
too
maybe
you
change
your
no
i
sha
change
my
mind
i
ever
and
ever
so
much
obliged
to
you
she
started
toward
the
door
but
turned
impulsively
and
said
oh
captain
eri
you
do
think
that
i
ungrateful
do
you
you
nor
captain
perez
nor
captain
jerry
wo
think
that
i
do
not
appreciate
all
your
kindness
you
wo
think
that
i
shirking
my
duty
or
that
i
do
want
to
help
take
care
of
grandfather
any
longer
you
wo
promise
me
you
she
choked
down
a
sob
as
she
asked
the
question
captain
eri
was
as
much
moved
as
she
was
he
hastened
to
answer
no
no
no
he
exclaimed
course
we
wo
do
no
such
thing
run
right
along
and
do
think
another
word
about
it
wait
till
have
a
plan
fixed
up
to
land
that
see
if
i
but
all
that
evening
he
worked
at
the
model
of
the
clipper
and
the
expression
on
his
face
as
he
whittled
showed
that
he
was
puzzled
and
not
a
little
troubled
he
came
back
from
his
fishing
next
day
a
little
earlier
than
usual
changed
his
for
his
second
best
suit
harnessed
daniel
into
the
buggy
and
then
came
into
the
house
and
announced
that
he
was
going
over
to
the
neck
on
an
errand
and
if
elsie
wanted
to
go
with
him
he
should
be
glad
of
her
company
as
this
was
but
part
of
a
scheme
the
young
lady
declared
that
a
ride
was
just
what
she
needed
captain
eri
said
but
little
as
they
drove
up
to
the
main
road
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
elsie
too
was
very
quiet
when
they
reached
the
fruit
and
candy
shop
just
around
the
corner
the
captain
stopped
the
horse
got
down
and
went
in
when
he
came
out
he
had
a
handful
of
cigars
why
captain
eri
said
elsie
i
did
know
that
you
smoked
cigars
i
thought
a
pipe
was
your
well
speakin
is
was
the
answer
but
electioneerin
now
and
politics
without
cigars
would
be
like
a
chowder
without
any
clams
rum
goes
with
some
kind
of
politics
but
terbacker
kind
of
chums
in
with
all
kinds
always
safe
to
jedge
a
candidate
by
the
kind
of
cigars
he
gives
out
neither
i
found
that
out
reminds
me
of
a
funny
thing
that
obed
nickerson
told
me
one
time
obed
used
to
be
in
politics
a
good
deal
up
and
down
the
cape
here
and
he
had
influence
was
when
bradley
up
to
fall
river
was
runnin
for
congress
they
had
a
kind
of
in
his
office
a
whole
gang
of
district
leaders
and
obed
he
was
one
of
bradley
went
to
git
out
the
and
was
empty
so
he
called
in
the
boy
that
swept
out
and
run
errands
for
him
give
the
youngster
a
bill
and
told
him
to
go
down
to
a
terbacker
store
handy
and
buy
another
box
well
the
boy
he
was
a
new
one
that
bradley
jest
hired
seemed
kind
of
surprised
to
think
of
anybody
bein
so
reckless
as
to
buy
a
whole
box
of
cigars
at
once
but
he
went
and
pretty
soon
come
back
with
the
box
the
old
man
told
him
to
open
it
and
pass
round
well
everybody
was
lookin
to
a
treat
bradley
had
the
name
of
better
stuff
than
the
average
but
when
they
lit
up
and
got
obed
said
you
could
see
that
the
gang
was
and
some
disgusted
the
old
man
did
take
one
at
fust
but
everybody
else
puffed
away
and
the
smoke
and
smell
got
thicker
thicker
obed
said
it
reminded
him
of
a
stable
afire
more
anything
else
pretty
soon
bradley
bit
the
end
of
one
of
the
things
and
touched
a
match
to
it
he
puffed
twice
obed
swears
that
and
then
he
yelled
for
the
boy
the
lord
sake
he
says
you
git
them
cigars
well
it
come
out
that
the
boy
had
told
who
the
cigars
was
for
and
bought
a
box
of
the
kind
his
brother
that
worked
in
the
cotton
mill
smoked
obed
said
you
ought
to
have
seen
bradley
face
when
the
youngster
handed
him
back
seven
dollars
and
cents
they
reached
that
part
of
orham
which
is
called
the
neck
and
pulled
up
before
a
small
building
bearing
the
sign
solomon
bangs
real
estate
and
here
the
captain
turned
to
his
companion
and
asked
sure
you
have
changed
your
mind
elsie
you
want
that
job
i
have
changed
my
mind
captain
well
i
wanted
to
be
sure
i
should
hate
to
ask
sol
bangs
for
anything
and
then
have
to
back
out
afterwards
come
on
soloman
bangs
was
the
chairman
of
the
orham
he
was
a
short
stout
man
with
sandy
and
a
bald
head
he
received
them
with
becoming
condescension
and
asked
if
they
would
sit
down
why
i
got
a
little
i
want
to
talk
with
you
sol
said
the
captain
elsie
you
set
down
here
and
make
yourself
and
sol
and
me
go
inside
for
a
as
he
led
the
way
into
the
little
private
office
at
the
back
of
the
building
and
seemed
to
take
it
for
granted
that
bangs
would
follow
the
latter
gentleman
could
well
refuse
the
private
office
was
usually
reserved
for
interviews
with
widows
whose
homestead
mortgages
were
to
be
foreclosed
guileless
individuals
who
had
indorsed
notes
for
friends
or
others
whose
business
was
unpleasant
and
likely
to
be
accompanied
with
weeping
or
profanity
bangs
did
object
to
foreclosing
a
mortgage
but
he
disliked
to
have
a
prospective
customer
hear
the
dialogue
that
preceded
the
operation
on
this
occasion
the
door
of
the
sanctum
was
left
ajar
so
that
elsie
although
she
did
not
try
to
listen
could
not
very
well
help
hearing
what
was
said
she
heard
the
captain
commenting
on
the
late
cranberry
crop
the
exceptionally
pleasant
weather
of
the
past
month
and
other
irrelevant
subjects
then
the
perfumes
of
the
campaign
cigars
floated
out
through
the
doorway
let
see
said
captain
eri
when
town
meetin
day
first
tuesday
in
december
replied
bangs

pretty
nigh

the
equivocal
answer

good

carrying
that
mortgage
for
so
long
it
i
ca
be
santa
claus
for
the
whole
town
business

business
and
i
got
to
look
out
for
i
that
so
still
folks
talk
and
seth
got
lots
of
eri
i
ai
denying
that
you
could
do
a
heap
to
hurt
me
if
you
wanted
to
but
i
do
know
why
you
should
i
always
been
square
with
you
far
i
know
what
have
you
got
against
me
oh
nuthin
nuthin
did
i
hear
you
was
tryin
to
get
that
harniss
teacher
to
come
down
here
and
take
carrie
nixon
place
when
she
got
married
well
i
thought
of
her
she
all
night
is
she
yes
i
she
is
be
better
if
she
lived
in
orham
maybe
and
folks
could
say
you
went
out
of
town
for
a
teacher
when
you
could
have
had
one
right
from
home
then
she
some
relation
of
your
cousin
ai
she
that
all
right
but
well
you
ca
pay
attention
to
everything
that
could
have
got
one
right
from
home
who
we
get
dave
eldredge
girl
i
suppose
i
heard
she
was
after
the
conversation
that
followed
was
in
a
lower
tone
and
elsie
heard
but
little
of
it
she
heard
enough
however
to
infer
that
captain
eri
was
still
the
disinterested
friend
and
that
solomon
was
very
anxious
to
retain
that
friendship
after
a
while
the
striking
of
matches
indicated
that
fresh
cigars
were
being
lighted
and
then
the
pair
rose
from
their
chairs
and
entered
the
outer
office
bangs
was
very
gracious
exceedingly
so
miss
preston
he
said
hedge
tells
me
that
it
er
might
be
possible
for
us
er
for
the
town
to
secure
er
to
in
short
for
us
to
have
you
for
our
teacher
in
the
upstairs
room
it
ai
necessary
for
me
to
say
that
er
a
teacher
from
radcliffe
do
come
our
way
very
often
and
that
we
that
is
the
town
of
orham
would
er
feel
itself
lucky
if
you
be
willing
to
of
course
i
told
him
elsie
said
captain
eri
that
you
think
of
comin
for
dollars
a
month
or
anything
like
that
of
course
is
as
though
you
really
needed
the
i
understand
i
understand
said
the
pompous
committeeman
i
think
that
can
be
arranged
i
really
think
er
miss
preston
that
there
any
reason
why
you
ca
consider
it
settled
ahem
elsie
thanked
him
trying
her
best
not
to
smile
and
they
were
bowed
out
by
the
great
man
who
however
called
the
captain
to
one
side
and
whispered
eagerly
to
him
for
a
moment
or
two
the
word
seth
was
mentioned
at
least
once
why
captain
eri
exclaimed
elsie
as
they
drove
away
the
captain
grinned
did
know
i
was
such
a
heeler
did
you
he
said
well
i
tell
you
if
you
fishin
for
eels
there
ai
no
use
usin
a
jig
sol
he
a
little
mite
eely
and
you
got
to
use
the
kind
of
bait
that
fetch
that
sort
of
but
i
should
think
he
would
care
whether
he
was
on
the
or
not
it
is
such
an
exalted
captain
eri
answer
was
in
the
form
of
a
parable
old
laban
simpkins
that
lived
here
one
time
he
said
was
a
mighty
hard
ticket
drank
rum
by
the
hogshead
pounded
his
wife
till
she
left
him
and
was
a
tough
nut
well
one
evenin
labe
was
comin
home
pretty
and
he
fell
into
jonadab
wixon
well
wonder
he
killed
but
he
and
they
fished
him
out
in
a
little
while
he
said
that
was
the
deepest
well
he
ever
saw
said
he
begun
to
think
it
reached
clear
through
to
the
hereafter
and
when
he
struck
the
water
he
was
to
find
it
hot
he
the
church
the
next
week
and
somebody
asked
him
if
he
thought
religion
would
keep
him
from
fallin
into
any
more
wells
he
said
no
said
he
was
lookin
out
for
somethin
further
on
well
that
the
way
is
with
sol
all
right
but
this
section
of
the
cape
nominates
a
state
representative
next
year
i
must
forgit
to
see
seth
he
added
i
promised
i
would
and
besides
with
a
wink
i
think
be
better
to
do
it
between
you
and
me
i
do
seth
knows
that
he
been
of
runnin
for
the
committee
and
has
decided
not
the
second
member
of
the
school
board
john
mullett
was
so
the
captain
said
a
sort
of
me
too
to
bangs
and
would
vote
as
his
friend
directed
the
third
member
was
langworthy
the
baptist
minister
and
although
two
to
one
was
a
clear
majority
captain
eri
asserted
that
there
was
nothing
like
a
unanimous
vote
and
so
they
decided
to
call
upon
the
reverend
gentleman
they
found
him
at
home
and
elsie
was
surprised
after
the
previous
interview
to
see
how
differently
her
champion
handled
the
case
there
was
no
preliminary
parley
and
no
beating
about
the
bush
miss
claim
to
the
position
was
stated
clearly
and
with
vigor
also
the
reasons
why
she
should
receive
a
higher
salary
than
had
previously
been
paid
were
set
forth
it
was
something
of
a
surprise
to
elsie
as
it
had
been
to
ralph
to
see
how
highly
the
that
is
the
respectable
portion
of
them
seemed
to
value
the
opinions
of
this
but
uneducated
seaman
and
yet
when
she
considered
that
she
too
went
to
him
for
advice
that
she
would
not
have
asked
of
other
and
far
more
learned
acquaintances
it
did
not
seem
so
surprising
after
all
the
clergyman
had
had
several
candidates
in
mind
but
he
was
easily
won
over
to
elsie
side
partly
by
the
captain
argument
and
partly
because
he
was
favorably
impressed
by
the
young
lady
appearance
and
manner
he
expressed
himself
as
being
convinced
that
she
would
be
exactly
the
sort
of
teacher
that
the
school
required
and
pledged
his
vote
unconditionally
and
so
as
captain
eri
said
the
being
over
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
wait
for
the
election
and
elsie
and
he
agreed
to
keep
the
affair
a
secret
until
she
received
formal
notice
of
the
appointment
this
was
undoubtedly
a
good
plan
but
unfortunately
for
its
success
solomon
bangs
called
upon
his
fellow
in
the
committee
mullett
to
inform
the
latter
that
he
entirely
unaided
had
discovered
the
very
teacher
that
orham
needed
in
the
person
of
john
granddaughter
mullett
living
up
to
his
me
too
reputation
indorsed
the
selection
with
enthusiasm
and
not
only
did
that
but
also
told
everyone
he
met
so
that
captain
perez
heard
of
it
at
the
the
very
next
afternoon
the
natural
surprise
of
this
gentleman
and
of
captain
jerry
at
their
guest
sudden
determination
was
met
by
plausible
explanations
from
captain
eri
to
the
effect
that
elsie
was
a
smart
girl
and
like
to
be
hangin
doin
nothin
now
that
her
grandpa
was
some
elsie
own
reason
as
expressed
to
them
being
just
this
the
pair
accepted
it
without
further
questioning
neither
of
them
attached
much
importance
to
the
letter
which
she
had
received
although
captain
perez
did
ask
mrs
snow
if
she
knew
from
whom
it
came
the
lady
from
nantucket
was
not
so
easily
satisfied
at
her
first
opportunity
she
cornered
captain
eri
and
they
discussed
the
whole
affair
from
beginning
to
end
there
was
nothing
unusual
in
this
proceeding
for
discussions
concerning
household
matters
and
questions
of
domestic
policy
were
between
these
two
getting
to
be
more
and
more
frequent
mrs
snow
was
now
accepted
by
all
as
one
of
the
family
and
captain
eri
had
come
to
hold
a
high
opinion
of
her
and
her
views
what
he
liked
about
her
he
said
was
her
good
and
whereas
he
had
formerly
trusted
to
his
own
share
of
this
virtue
almost
altogether
now
he
was
glad
to
have
hers
to
help
out
the
marriage
idea
that
which
had
brought
the
housekeeper
to
orham
was
now
seldom
mentioned
in
fact
captain
eri
had
almost
entirely
ceased
to
ruffle
jerry
feelings
with
reference
to
it
mrs
snow
of
course
said
nothing
about
it
but
for
that
matter
she
said
very
little
about
herself
or
her
affairs
it
was
a
curious
fact
that
the
lady
from
nantucket
had
never
referred
except
in
a
casual
way
to
her
past
history
she
had
never
told
how
she
came
to
answer
the
advertisement
in
the
nuptial
chime
nor
to
explain
how
so
a
person
as
she
was
had
ever
seen
that
famous
sheet
as
she
said
nothing
concerning
these
things
no
one
felt
at
liberty
to
inquire
and
in
the
course
of
time
even
captain
lively
curiosity
had
lapsed
into
a
trance
mrs
snow
was
certain
that
elsie
reason
for
wishing
to
obtain
the
position
of
was
something
more
specific
than
the
one
advanced
she
was
also
certain
that
the
girl
was
troubled
about
something
the
root
of
the
matter
she
believed
was
contained
in
the
mysterious
letter
as
captain
eri
was
of
precisely
the
same
opinion
speculation
between
the
two
as
to
what
that
letter
might
have
contained
was
as
lively
as
it
was
unfruitful
one
thing
was
certain
elsie
was
not
as
she
had
formerly
been
she
did
her
best
to
appear
the
same
but
she
was
much
more
quiet
and
had
fits
of
absentmindedness
that
the
captain
and
the
housekeeper
noticed
she
had
no
more
evening
errands
but
she
occasionally
took
long
walks
in
the
afternoons
and
on
these
walks
she
evidently
preferred
to
be
alone
whether
hazeltine
noticed
this
change
in
her
was
a
question
the
captain
thought
he
did
but
at
any
rate
his
calls
were
none
the
less
frequent
and
he
showed
no
marked
objection
when
captain
jerry
who
now
considered
himself
bound
in
honor
to
bring
about
the
union
he
had
so
actively
championed
brought
to
bear
his
artful
schemes
for
leaving
the
young
folks
alone
these
devices
were
so
apparent
that
elsie
had
more
than
once
betrayed
some
symptoms
of
annoyance
all
of
which
were
lost
on
the
zealous
ralph
like
the
others
was
much
surprised
at
miss
preston
application
for
employment
but
as
it
was
manifestly
none
of
his
business
he
of
course
said
nothing
at
the
next
committee
meeting
elsie
was
unanimously
chosen
to
fill
miss
nixon
shoes
as
trainer
of
the
young
idea
at
the
grammar
school
and
as
miss
nixon
was
very
anxious
to
be
rid
of
her
responsibilities
in
order
that
she
might
become
the
carefree
bride
of
a
widower
with
two
small
children
the
took
place
in
a
fortnight
from
her
first
day
labors
elsie
returned
calm
and
unruffled
she
had
met
the
usual
small
rebellion
against
a
new
teacher
and
had
conquered
it
she
said
she
believed
she
had
a
good
class
and
she
should
get
on
with
them
very
nicely
it
should
be
mentioned
in
passing
however
that
josiah
bartlett
usually
the
in
all
sorts
of
trouble
was
a
trifle
upset
because
the
new
schoolmistress
lived
in
the
same
house
with
him
and
so
had
not
yet
decided
just
how
far
it
was
safe
to
go
in
trespassing
against
law
and
order
thanksgiving
day
came
and
the
captains
entertained
miss
patience
davis
and
her
brother
and
ralph
hazeltine
at
dinner
that
dinner
was
an
event
captain
eri
and
mrs
snow
spent
a
full
twenty
minutes
with
the
driver
of
the
butcher
cart
giving
him
directions
concerning
the
exact
breed
of
turkey
that
was
to
be
delivered
and
apparently
these
orders
were
effectual
for
captain
luther
who
was
obliged
to
hurry
back
to
the
station
as
soon
as
dinner
was
over
said
that
he
was
so
full
of
white
meat
and
stuffing
that
he
he
should
gobble
all
the
way
to
the
beach
his
sister
stayed
until
the
next
day
and
this
was
very
pleasing
to
all
hands
particularly
captain
perez
they
had
games
in
the
evening
and
here
the
captains
distinguished
themselves
seth
wingate
and
his
wife
and
and
obed
nickerson
came
in
as
did
several
other
retired
mariners
and
their
obed
brought
his
fiddle
and
sat
in
the
corner
and
played
the
music
for
a
virginia
reel
and
ralph
laughed
until
he
choked
to
see
captain
jerry
half
of
his
torn
loose
from
the
button
and
flapping
like
a
sail
convoy
stout
wingate
from
one
end
of
the
line
to
the
other
throwing
into
the
performance
all
the
fancy
cuts
and
he
learned
at
the
thanksgiving
balls
of
a
good
many
years
before
captain
perez
danced
with
miss
patience
who
assured
him
she
had
never
had
such
a
good
time
since
she
was
born
the
only
scoffer
was
the
bored
josiah
who
being
a
sophisticated
new
yorker
sat
in
the
best
chair
and
gazed
contemptuously
upon
the
entire
proceeding
he
told
web
saunders
the
next
day
that
he
never
saw
such
a
gang
of
crazy
jays
in
his
life
even
john
baxter
was
better
that
day
he
seemed
a
trifle
more
rational
and
apparently
understood
when
they
told
him
that
it
was
thanksgiving
there
would
have
been
no
cloud
anywhere
had
not
mrs
snow
entering
her
room
after
elsie
had
gone
to
bed
found
that
young
lady
awake
and
crying
silently
and
she
would
tell
what
the
trouble
was
said
the
housekeeper
to
captain
eri
the
next
day
said
it
was
nothin
she
was
kind
of
worried
her
grandpa
now
you
and
me
know
it
that
i
wish
to
goodness
we
knew
what
it
the
captain
scratched
his
nose
with
a
perplexed
air
there
one
feller
i
like
to
have
a
talk
with
jest
now
he
said
that
the
one
that
invented
that
yarn
a
woman
not
bein
able
to
keep
a
chapter
xiii
captain
jerry
makes
a
mess
of
it
it
was
during
the
week
that
followed
the
holiday
so
gloriously
celebrated
that
captain
jerry
made
a
mess
of
it
and
all
with
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
elsie
had
had
a
hard
day
at
the
school
principally
owing
to
the
perversity
of
the
irrepressible
josiah
whose
love
for
deviltry
was
getting
the
better
of
his
respect
for
the
new
teacher
the
boy
had
discovered
that
elsie
never
reported
his
bad
conduct
to
captain
perez
and
therefore
that
the
situation
was
not
greatly
different
from
what
it
had
been
during
the
reign
of
miss
nixon
on
this
particular
day
he
had
been
a
little
worse
than
usual
and
as
uneasiness
and
mischief
in
a
schoolroom
are
as
catching
as
the
chickenpox
elsie
came
home
tired
and
nervous
captain
eri
and
mrs
snow
were
certain
that
this
increasing
nervousness
on
the
part
of
their
guest
was
not
due
to
school
troubles
alone
but
at
any
rate
nervous
she
was
and
particularly
nervous
and
it
must
be
confessed
somewhat
inclined
to
be
irritable
during
the
supper
and
afterward
on
this
night
the
beginning
of
the
trouble
was
when
ralph
hazeltine
called
mrs
snow
was
with
her
patient
in
the
upper
room
captain
eri
was
out
and
captain
perez
and
captain
jerry
were
with
elsie
in
the
dining
room
the
electrician
was
made
welcome
by
the
trio
more
especially
by
the
captains
for
miss
preston
was
in
no
mood
to
be
and
a
few
minutes
of
general
conversation
followed
then
captain
jerry
in
accordance
with
his
plan
of
campaign
laid
down
his
newspaper
coughed
emphatically
to
attract
the
attention
of
his
partner
and
said
well
i
guess
i
go
out
and
look
at
the
weather
for
a
spell
come
on
why
captain
jerry
exclaimed
elsie
you
were
out
looking
at
the
weather
only
ten
minutes
ago
i
do
think
it
has
changed
much
since
then
why
do
you
stay
here
and
keep
us
company
oh
you
ca
never
tell
about
the
weather
this
coast
likely
to
change
most
any
time
besides
with
a
wink
that
expressed
comprehension
unlimited
i
reckon
you
and
hazeltine
do
care
much
the
company
of
old
fogies
like
me
and
perez
two
company
and
three
a
crowd
you
know
ho
ho
ho
captain
jerry
come
back
this
minute
but
the
captain
chuckled
and
shook
out
of
the
door
followed
by
the
obedient
perez
who
having
pledged
fealty
stuck
to
his
colors
whatever
might
happen
at
another
time
elsie
would
probably
have
appreciated
and
enjoyed
the
joke
as
much
as
anyone
but
this
evening
it
did
not
appeal
to
her
in
the
least
ralph
put
in
a
very
uncomfortable
and
then
cut
his
visit
short
and
departed
it
was
rather
sharp
and
chilly
outside
but
the
breeze
felt
like
a
breath
from
the
tropics
compared
with
the
atmosphere
of
that
dining
room
it
certainly
was
captain
jerry
unlucky
evening
for
he
left
perez
chatting
with
a
fisherman
friend
who
had
left
a
favorite
pipe
in
his
shanty
and
had
come
down
to
get
it
and
entered
the
house
alone
he
had
seen
the
electrician
go
and
was
surprised
at
the
brevity
of
his
call
but
he
was
as
far
from
suspecting
that
he
himself
was
the
indirect
cause
of
the
said
brevity
as
a
mortal
could
be
he
came
into
the
dining
room
hung
his
cap
on
the
back
of
a
chair
and
remarked
cheerfully
well
elsie
what
did
you
send
your
company
home
so
quick
for
land
sake
twelve
none
too
late
for
me
when
i
was
young
and
goin
round
to
see
the
but
miss
preston
did
not
smile
on
the
contrary
she
frowned
and
when
she
spoke
the
captain
had
a
vague
feeling
that
someone
had
dropped
an
icicle
inside
his
shirt
collar
captain
jerry
said
the
young
lady
i
want
to
have
a
talk
with
you
why
do
you
think
it
necessary
to
get
up
and
leave
the
room
whenever
hazeltine
calls
you
do
it
every
time
and
was
no
exception
except
that
by
what
you
said
you
made
me
appear
a
little
more
ridiculous
than
usual
now
why
do
you
do
it
the
captain
jaw
fell
he
stared
at
his
questioner
to
see
if
she
was
not
joking
but
finding
no
encouragement
of
that
kind
stammered
why
do
i
do
it
why
yes
why
why
i
thought
you
wanted
me
wanted
you
to
why
should
you
think
that
please
well
i
do
know
i
thought
you
two
would
ruther
be
alone
i
know
when
i
used
to
go
to
see
my
wife
we
was
married
i
please
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
hazeltine
visits
here
why
why
nothin
i
if
you
say
so
i
jest
thought
what
right
have
you
to
suppose
that
hazeltine
is
calling
on
me
more
than
any
other
person
or
persons
in
this
house
this
was
something
of
a
poser
but
the
captain
did
his
best
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
and
rubbed
his
knee
and
then
blurted
out
well
i
i
that
is
we
thought
he
was
jest
he
would
that
all
if
i
thought
why
see
here
elsie
do
you
think
he
comin
to
see
you
this
was
a
return
thrust
that
was
hard
to
parry
but
although
the
young
lady
color
heightened
just
a
bit
she
answered
without
much
hesitation
i
do
know
that
i
do
at
any
rate
i
have
given
you
no
authority
to
act
on
any
such
assumption
and
i
do
want
you
to
put
me
again
in
the
ridiculous
position
you
did
this
evening
and
as
you
have
done
so
often
before
why
his
visits
might
be
perfect
torture
to
me
and
still
i
should
have
to
endure
them
out
of
common
politeness
i
could
go
away
and
leave
him
captain
jerry
face
was
a
study
of
chagrin
and
troubled
repentance
elsie
he
said
i
awful
sorry
i
am
so
if
i
thought
i
was
torturin
of
you
of
makin
it
pleasant
i
never
have
done
it
sure
i
wo
go
out
again
i
wo
honest
i
hope
you
wo
lay
it
up
against
me
i
meant
now
if
captain
perez
had
delayed
his
entrance
to
that
dining
room
only
two
or
three
minutes
longer
if
he
had
not
come
in
just
in
time
to
prevent
elsie
making
the
explanatory
and
soothing
answer
that
was
on
her
tongue
events
would
probably
have
been
entirely
different
and
a
good
deal
of
trouble
might
have
been
saved
but
in
he
came
as
if
some
perverse
imp
had
been
waiting
to
give
him
the
signal
and
the
interview
between
captain
jerry
and
the
young
lady
whom
he
had
unwittingly
offended
broke
off
then
and
there
elsie
went
upstairs
feeling
a
little
and
with
an
uneasy
idea
that
she
had
said
more
than
she
should
have
captain
perez
took
up
the
newspaper
and
sat
down
to
read
as
for
captain
jerry
he
sat
down
too
but
merely
to
get
his
thoughts
assorted
into
an
arrangement
less
like
a
spilled
box
of
jackstraws
the
captain
wonderful
scheme
that
he
had
boasted
of
and
worked
so
hard
for
had
fallen
to
earth
like
an
exploded
airship
and
when
it
hit
it
hurt
his
first
idea
was
to
follow
the
usual
procedure
and
take
the
whole
matter
to
captain
eri
for
settlement
but
the
more
he
considered
this
plan
the
less
he
liked
it
captain
eri
was
an
unmerciful
tease
and
he
would
be
sure
to
rub
it
in
in
a
way
the
mere
thought
of
which
made
his
friend
squirm
there
was
much
use
in
confiding
to
captain
perez
either
he
must
keep
the
secret
and
pretend
that
everything
was
working
smoothly
then
his
thoughts
turned
to
hazeltine
and
when
he
considered
the
wrong
he
had
done
that
young
man
he
squirmed
again
there
was
a
doubt
in
his
mind
that
ralph
felt
exactly
as
elsie
did
about
his
interference
captain
jerry
decided
that
he
owed
the
electrician
an
apology
and
determined
to
offer
it
at
the
first
opportunity
and
the
opportunity
came
the
very
next
morning
for
mrs
snow
wanted
some
clams
for
dinner
and
asked
him
to
dig
some
for
her
the
best
clams
in
the
vicinity
were
those
in
the
flat
across
the
bay
near
the
cable
station
and
the
captain
took
his
bucket
and
hoe
and
rowed
over
there
as
he
was
digging
ralph
came
strolling
down
to
the
shore
hazeltine
was
clear
and
hearty
captain
was
hesitating
and
formal
the
talk
that
followed
was
rather
finally
the
captain
laid
down
his
hoe
and
came
splashing
over
to
where
his
friend
was
standing
mr
hazeltine
he
said
confusedly
i
kind
of
feel
as
if
i
ought
to
beg
your
pardon
i
awful
sorry
i
done
what
i
did
but
as
i
said
to
elsie
i
meant
well
and
i
sorry
sorry
for
what
why
for
leavin
you
and
her
alone
so
when
you
come
to
the
house
you
see
i
never
thought
but
what
you
both
like
it
and
till
she
raked
me
over
the
coals
so
for
doin
it
that
i
realized
how
things
raked
you
over
the
coals
i
afraid
i
do
it
is
unnecessary
to
repeat
the
whole
of
the
long
and
tangled
conversation
that
ensued
the
captain
tried
to
explain
tumbled
down
metaphorically
speaking
got
up
again
and
started
off
on
another
tack
in
his
anxiety
to
make
his
position
perfectly
clear
he
quoted
from
elsie
remarks
of
the
previous
evening
and
then
thinking
perhaps
he
had
gone
too
far
tried
to
smooth
these
over
by
more
explanations
repeating
this
process
several
times
got
him
into
such
a
snarl
that
he
scarcely
knew
what
he
was
saying
when
the
agony
was
over
ralph
had
received
the
impression
that
miss
preston
had
said
his
visits
were
a
perfect
torture
to
her
that
she
objected
to
being
left
alone
with
him
that
she
held
captain
jerry
responsible
for
these
things
and
that
the
latter
was
sorry
for
something
or
other
though
what
it
was
he
ralph
did
know
or
care
particularly
to
the
captain
continued
apologies
he
muttered
absently
that
it
was
all
right
and
walked
slowly
away
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
captain
jerry
was
relieved
by
this
expression
of
forgiveness
he
felt
that
the
situation
was
what
he
would
like
to
have
it
but
at
any
rate
he
had
done
his
duty
this
was
a
great
consolation
ralph
did
call
that
evening
or
the
next
when
he
did
drop
in
it
was
merely
to
inquire
concerning
john
baxter
progress
and
to
chat
for
a
moment
with
the
captains
his
next
visit
was
a
week
later
and
was
just
as
brief
and
formal
if
elsie
noticed
this
sudden
change
she
said
nothing
there
might
have
been
some
comment
by
the
others
had
not
a
new
sensation
so
occupied
their
minds
as
to
shut
out
everything
else
this
sensation
was
caused
by
josiah
bartlett
who
ran
away
one
night
with
his
belongings
tied
up
in
a
brown
paper
parcel
leaving
a
note
saying
that
he
had
gone
to
enlist
in
the
navy
and
was
coming
back
any
more
there
were
lively
times
the
next
morning
when
the
note
was
found
captain
perez
was
for
harnessing
up
immediately
and
starting
off
to
find
the
lost
one
hit
or
miss
captain
eri
soon
showed
him
the
folly
of
this
proceeding
and
instead
hurried
to
the
railway
station
and
sent
a
telegram
describing
the
fugitive
to
the
conductor
of
the
boston
train
it
caught
the
conductor
at
sandwich
and
the
local
constable
at
buzzard
bay
caught
the
boy
josiah
was
luxuriously
puffing
a
cigar
in
the
smoking
car
and
it
was
a
and
humiliated
prodigal
that
accompanied
by
the
a
constable
returned
to
orham
that
night
but
the
stubbornness
remained
and
the
next
day
perez
sought
captain
eri
in
a
troubled
frame
of
mind
eri
he
said
dejectedly
i
do
know
what
i
goin
to
do
with
that
boy
he
too
many
for
me
that
boy
is
seems
he

says

the
sperit
of
the
old
scratch

him
and
i

clean
discouraged
and
wore
out
and
i
know
that

pretty
soon

exclaimed
his
friend
stuffy
as

cross
to
him
but
somethin
got
to
be
done
and
if
you
can
help
me
out
any
way
i
never
forgit
it
captain
eri
scratched
his
chin
humph

grunted
reflectively
he
could
git
into
the
navy
he
too
young
more
likely
to
be
a
stowaway
on
a
merchantman
and
then
roustabout
on
a
cattle
boat
or
some
such
thing
even
if
he
lied
his
age
and
did
git
to
be
a
sort
of
a
ship
boy
on
a
sailin
vessel
you
and
me
know
what
that
means
nowadays

presume
likely

in
his
bein
killed

some
rumshop
scrimmage

books
i
he
ai
been
on
the
water
much
sence
he
been
down
here
has
he
not
more
once
or
twice
except
in
a
dory
goin
to
the
beach
or
somethin
like
that
so
that
what
i
thought
well
perez
i
tell
you
the
boy
does
need
breakin
in
that
a
fact
and
i
think
maybe
i
could
do
it
i
could
use
a
young
feller
on
my
boat
to
go
coddin
with
me
i
mean
let
me
have
the
boy
under
me
no
meddlin
from
anybody
for
a
couple
of
months
let
him
sign
articles
and
ship
of
me
for
that
time
maybe
i
could
make
a
white
man
of
i
do
he
do
i
i
could
talk
him
into
it
there
some
butter
on
my
tongue
when
it
you
have
to
promise
not
to
lay
a
hand
on
him
in
anger
that
what
i
promised
his
all
right
i
promise
it
now
that
all
right
perez
you
and
me
are
old
shipmates
and
bound
to
help
each
other
out
just
trust
him
to
me
and
do
ask
too
many
questions
is
it
a
trade
good
they
shook
hands
on
it
and
then
captain
eri
went
in
to
talk
to
the
unreconciled
runaway
that
young
gentleman
fresh
from
his
triumph
over
his
uncle
at
first
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
scheme
he
was
going
to
be
a
cheap
guy
fisherman
he
was
going
into
the
navy
the
captain
did
not
attempt
to
urge
him
neither
did
he
preach
or
patronize
he
simply
leaned
back
in
the
rocker
and
began
spinning
sailor
yarns
he
told
of
all
sorts
of
adventures
in
all
climates
and
with
all
sorts
of
people
he
had
seen
everything
under
the
sun
apparently
and
according
to
him
there
was
no
life
so
free
and
void
of
all
restraint
as
that
of
an
able
seaman
on
a
merchant
ship
or
preferably
on
a
fisherman
but
one
point
he
made
clear
and
that
was
that
unless
the
applicant
had
had
previous
training
his
lot
was
likely
to
be
an
unhappy
one
of
course
he
said
as
he
rose
to
go
it
was
my
idea
to
sort
of
train
you
up
so
you
could
be
ready
when
was
time
to
ship
but
long
you
do
want
to
why
it
all
i
go
with
you
cap
said
josiah
whose
eyes
were
shining
good
that
the
talk
you
might
as
well
sign
articles
right
away
wait
till
i
git
he
brought
pen
ink
and
paper
and
proceeded
to
indite
a
formidable
document
to
the
effect
that
josiah
bartlett
able
seaman
was
to
ship
aboard
the
catboat
mary
ellen
for
a
term
of
two
months
wages
five
dollars
a
month
you
see
he
said
i
put
you
down
as
able
seaman
that
what
you
be
when
i
git
through
with
you
now
so
josiah
signed
and
then
captain
eri
affixed
his
own
signature
with
a
flourish
there
exclaimed
the
captain
bringing
his
big
palm
down
on
the
back
of
the
able
seaman
with
a
thump
that
brought
water
into
the
eyes
of
that
proud
youth
you
my
man
shipmate
we
sail
mornin
at
four
rain
or
shine
i
call
you
at
quarter
of
be

bet
old
man
said
josiah
captain
perez
met
his
friend
as
they
came
out
of
the
parlor
now
eri
he
whispered
be
easy
as
you
can
with
him
wo
you
the
captain
answered
in
the
very
words
of
his
crew
you
bet
he
said
fervently
and
went
away
whistling
captain
perez
slept
better
that
night
chapter
xiv
the
voyage
of
an
able
seaman
promptly
at
a
quarter
to
four
the
next
morning
captain
eri
rapped
on
the
parlor
door
josiah
who
had
been
dressed
since
three
appeared
almost
instantly
they
walked
down
to
the
shore
together
and
the
eyes
twinkled
as
he
noted
the
elaborate
roll
in
the
boy
walk
the
mary
ellen
was
anchored
between
the
beaches
and
they
rowed
off
to
her
in
a
dory
it
was
and
cold
and
raw
lanterns
showed
on
two
or
three
of
the
other
boats
near
by
and
as
josiah
and
the
captain
pulled
up
the
anchor
a
dim
shape
glided
past
in
the
blackness
it
was
the
you
and
i
bound
out
ira
sparrow
was
at
the
helm
and
he
hailed
the
mary
ellen
saying
something
about
the
weather
it
be
kind
of
ca
for
a
spell
replied
captain
eri
but
i
would
wonder
if
we
had
some
wind
night
here
you
hand
he
added
turning
to
josiah
stand
by
to
git
the
canvas
on
the
mainsail
was
soon
hoisted
and
the
catboat
moved
slowly
out
of
the
bay
gee
it
dark
exclaimed
josiah
what
are
you
goin
way
off
here
for
why
do
you
go
straight
out
i
take
the
short
cut
through
the
narrers
replied
the
captain
but
i
thought
you
might
like
the
breakers
on
the
shoals
so
i
goin
the
huh
i
ai
of
breakers
ca
be
too
rough
for
me
wisht
blow
to
beat
the
maybe
by
and
by
pretty
slick
now
it
was
after
sunrise
when
they
reached
the
ledge
where
codfish
most
do
congregate
the
land
was
a
mere
yellow
streak
on
the
horizon
the
stiff
easterly
blow
of
the
day
before
had
left
a
smooth
heavy
swell
that
tripping
over
the
submerged
ledge
alternately
tossed
the
mary
ellen
high
in
air
and
dropped
her
toward
the
bottom
it
was
cold
and
the
newly
risen
december
sun
did
not
seem
to
have
much
warmth
in
it
anchor
over
the
side
the
captain
proposed
breakfast
the
able
seaman
did
not
feel
very
hungry
but
he
managed
to
swallow
a
egg
and
a
sandwich
and
then
just
to
show
that
he
had
reached
the
dignity
of
manhood
leaned
back
against
the
side
of
the
cockpit
lit
a
cigarette
and
observed
cheerfully
this
is
hot
stuff
ai
it
cap
captain
eri
wiped
the
crumbs
from
his
mouth
leisurely
produced
his
pipe
and
proceeded
to
fill
it
with
tobacco
shaved
from
a
chunky
plug
what
smoke
them
things
for
he
asked
contemptuously
referring
to
the
cigarette
nobody
but
dudes
and
sissies
smoke
that
kind
of
truck
here
take
this
pipe
and
smoke
like
a
josiah
looked
askance
at
the
proffered
pipe
oh
no
he
said
magnanimously
you
want
it
yourself
i
get
along
with
these
things
till
i
git
ashore
then
i
buy
a
pipe
of
my
never
you
mind
me
i
got
two
or
three
more
below
there
take
it
and
light
the
able
seaman
took
the
reeking
nicotine
soaked
affair
placed
it
gingerly
between
his
teeth
held
a
match
to
the
bowl
and
coughingly
emitted
a
cloud
of
smoke
the
pipe
wheezed
and
gurgled
and
the
mary
ellen
rocked
and
rolled
now
then
said
captain
eri
we
sojered
long
enough
go
below
and
bring
up
the
bait
bucket
and
the
josiah
staggered
into
the
little
cabin
reappeared
with
the
heavy
cod
lines
and
the
bucket
of
mussels
and
watched
while
the
captain
baited
all
ready
said
the
skipper
two
lines
apiece
one
over
each
side
watch
the
cod
bit
almost
immediately
and
for
ten
minutes
the
work
was
exciting
and
lively
the
captain
watching
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
noticed
that
his
assistant
pipe
was
wheezing
less
regularly
and
that
his
lines
were
thrown
over
more
and
more
listlessly
at
length
he
said
have
stopped
smokin
so
quick
have
you
what
the
matter
gone
out
here
a
i
guessed
i
smoked
enough
for
now
i
ca
fish
so
well
when
bosh
if
you
want
to
be
a
reel
sailor
you
must
smoke
all
the
time
light
reluctantly
the
boy
obeyed
and
puffed
with
feverish
energy
also
he
swallowed
with
vigor
the
cod
smelt
fishy
so
did
the
bait
and
the
catboat
rolled
and
rolled
suddenly
josiah
pulled
in
his
lines
and
took
the
pipe
from
his
lips
what
the
matter
inquired
the
watchful
skipper
i
i
guess
i
wo
fish
any
more
cap
kind
of
slow
sport
ai
it
guess
i
go
in
there
and
take
a
i
guess
you
wo
you
shipped
to
fish
and
you
goin
to
fish
pick
up
them
the
boy
sullenly
turned
toward
the
cabin
door
was
he
who
had
just
declared
himself
independent
of
school
restraint
he
who
had
once
been
the
thorn
in
the
flesh
of
every
policeman
in
the
th
ward
to
be
ordered
about
by
this
cape
cod
countryman
aw
go
chase
yourself
he
said
contemptuously
a
minute
after
when
he
picked
himself
up
from
the
heap
of
slimy
fish
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
he
saw
the
captain
standing
solidly
on
one
foot
while
the
other
was
drawn
easily
back
and
rested
on
its
toe
when
josiah
recovered
his
breath
the
burst
of
bad
language
with
which
he
assailed
his
companion
did
credit
to
his
street
bringing
up
it
was
as
short
as
it
was
fierce
however
and
ended
amid
the
cod
and
the
mussels
from
the
overturned
bait
bucket
but
as
the
captain
said
afterwards
he
was
spunky
and
rose
again
incoherent
with
rage
you
you
i
kill
you
he
shrieked
you
promised
not
to
touch
me
you
lyin
old
he
tried
to
get
out
of
the
way
but
did
succeed
and
this
time
merely
sat
up
and
sobbed
as
captain
eri
said
in
even
tones
no
i
not
lyin
i
promised
not
to
lay
a
hand
on
you
in
anger
all
fust
place
i
do
kick
with
my
hands
and
second
place
i
angry
now
then
pick
up
them
the
able
seaman
was
frightened
this
sort
of
treatment
was
new
to
him
he
judged
it
best
to
obey
now
and
get
square
later
on
he
sulkily
picked
up
the
codlines
and
threw
the
hooks
overboard
captain
eri
calmly
resuming
his
fishing
went
on
to
say
the
fust
thing
a
sailor
has
to
is
to
obey
orders
i
see
you
stopped
smokin
light
i
do
want
well
i
want
you
to
light
i
wo
oh
yes
i
will
he
eyed
the
threatening
boot
fearfully
and
lit
the
awful
pipe
with
shaking
fingers
but
he
had
taken
but
a
few
puffs
when
it
went
over
the
side
and
it
seemed
to
josiah
that
the
larger
half
of
himself
went
with
it
the
captain
watched
the
paroxysm
grimly
sick
hey
he
grunted
and
not
a
capful
of
wind
stirrin
a
healthy
sailor
i
thought
i
shipped
a
man
but
i
see
was
only
a
sassy
baby
my
uncle
labe
had
a
good
cure
for
seasickness
you
take
a
big
hunk
of
fat
salt
pork
dip
it
in
molasses
and
oh
another
spasm
dip
it
in
molasses
repeated
captain
eri
do
cap
please
do
another
thing
a
sailor
learns
is
not
to
call
his
skipper
a
hand
always
says
aye
sir
when
his
speaks
to
him
understand
that
oh
lord
what
ye
i
mean
aye
aye
aye
what
aye
aye
sir
oh
dear
me
that
better
now
pick
up
them
well
was
a
dreadful
forenoon
for
josiah
one
not
to
be
forgotten
the
boat
rolled
unceasingly
his
head
ached
and
pulling
the
heavy
cod
made
his
back
and
shoulders
lame
also
he
was
wet
and
cold
the
other
boats
scattered
about
the
fishing
grounds
pulled
up
their
anchors
and
started
for
home
but
captain
eri
did
not
budge
at
noon
he
opened
his
lunch
basket
again
and
munched
serenely
the
sight
of
the
greasy
ham
sandwiches
was
too
much
for
the
able
he
suffered
a
relapse
and
when
it
was
over
tumbled
on
the
seat
which
encircled
the
cockpit
and
being
completely
worn
out
went
fast
asleep
the
captain
watched
him
for
a
minute
or
two
smiled
in
a
not
unkindly
way
and
going
into
the
cabin
brought
out
an
old
pea
jacket
and
some
other
wraps
with
which
he
covered
the
sleeper
then
he
went
back
to
his
fishing
when
josiah
awoke
the
mary
ellen
was
heeled
over
on
her
side
her
sail
as
tight
as
a
drumhead
the
wind
was
whistling
through
the
cordage
and
the
boat
was
racing
through
seas
that
were
and
angry
with
whitecaps
on
their
crests
the
sun
was
hidden
by
tumbling
clouds
the
boy
felt
weak
and
strangely
humble
the
dreadful
nausea
was
gone
captain
eri
standing
at
the
tiller
regarded
him
sternly
but
there
was
the
suspicion
of
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
feelin
better
he
asked
ye
aye
aye
humph
want
to
smoke
again
pipe
right
there
on
the
no
thank
you
it
was
some
time
before
anything
more
was
said
josiah
was
gazing
at
the
yellow
that
on
every
tack
grew
nearer
at
length
the
captain
again
addressed
him
perez
ever
tell
you
our
fust
never
did
hey
well
i
will
him
and
me
run
away
to
sea
together
you
and
then
captain
eri
began
a
tale
that
caused
the
cold
shivers
to
chase
themselves
from
josiah
big
toe
to
the
longest
hair
on
his
head
it
was
the
story
of
two
boys
who
ran
away
and
shipped
aboard
an
australian
sailing
packet
and
contained
more
horrors
than
any
one
of
his
beloved
dime
novels
as
a
finishing
touch
the
narrator
turned
back
the
grizzled
hair
on
his
forehead
and
showed
a
scar
souvenir
of
a
first
mate
and
a
belaying
pin
he
rolled
up
his
flannel
shirtsleeve
and
displayed
a
slightly
misshapen
left
arm
broken
by
a
kick
from
a
drunken
captain
and
badly
set
by
the
same
individual
now
he
said
in
conclusion
i
you
think
i
was
pretty
hard
on
you
this
mornin
but
what
do
you
figger
that
you
have
got
if
you
talked
to
a
mate
the
way
you
done
to
me
do
know
i
have
been
killed
well
you
would
mighty
nigh
and
that
a
fact
now
i
tell
you
somethin
else
you
wanted
to
enlist
in
the
navy
i
understand
you
could
git
in
the
navy
anyway
you
too
young
but
you
could
what
then
you
never
git
any
higher
a
petty
officer
you
do
know
enough
the
only
way
to
git
into
the
navy
is
to
go
through
annapolis
and
git
an
education
i
tell
you
education
counts
me
and
perez
would
have
been
somethin
more
cheap
fishin
and
coastin
skippers
if
we
had
an
education
do
forgit
i
guess
i
do
want
to
be
a
sailor
anyway
sir
this
one
trip
is
enough
for
me
thank
ca
help
that
you
shipped
with
me
for
two
months
and
sail
with
me
for
two
months
every
time
i
go
out
you
wo
run
away
again
neither
i
look
out
for
that
you
sail
with
me
and
help
clean
fish
and
you
mind
me
and
you
say
you
smoke
if
you
do
want
to
with
a
smile
i
ai
that
then
went
on
the
captain
when
the
two
months
is
up
you
be
your
own
master
again
you
can
go
back
to
saunders
and
wixon
and
tucker

their
tribe
if
you
want
to
and
be
a
town
nuisance
and
a
or
you

go
to
school
for
a
few
years
more
and
behave

and
then
if

got
any
influence
with
the
congressman
from
this
district
and
i
sort
of
i
have
at
any
rate
you
can
go
to
annapolis
and
learn
to
be
a
navy
officer
that
my
offer
you
got
a
couple
of
months
to
think
it
over
the
catboat
swung
about
on
her
final
tack
and
stood
in
for
the
narrows
the
route
which
the
captain
had
spoken
of
as
the
short
from
where
josiah
sat
the
way
seemed
choked
with
lines
of
roaring
frothing
breakers
that
nothing
could
approach
and
keep
above
water
but
captain
eri
steered
the
mary
ellen
through
them
as
easily
as
a
new
york
cabdriver
guides
his
vehicle
through
a
jam
on
broadway
picking
out
the
smooth
places
and
avoiding
the
rough
ones
until
the
last
bar
was
crossed
and
the
boat
entered
the
sheltered
waters
of
the
bay
by
gum
exclaimed
the
enthusiastic
able
that
was
great
er
sir
that
part
of
what
i
you
in
the
next
two
months
said
the
captain
do
you
any
harm
to
know
it
when
you
in

chapter
xv
in
john
baxter
room
if
josiah
expected
any
relaxation
in
captain
eri
stern
discipline
he
was
disappointed
for
he
was
held
to
the
strict
letter
of
the
shipping
the
captain
even
went
to
the
length
of
transferring
perez
to
the
parlor
cot
and
of
compelling
the
boy
to
share
his
own
room
this
was
of
course
a
precaution
against
further
attempts
at
running
away
morning
after
morning
the
pair
rose
before
daylight
and
started
for
the
fishing
grounds
there
were
two
or
three
outbreaks
on
the
part
of
the
able
seaman
but
they
ended
in
but
one
way
complete
submission
after
a
while
josiah
being
by
no
means
dull
came
to
realize
that
when
he
behaved
like
a
man
he
was
treated
like
one
he
learned
to
steer
the
mary
ellen
and
to
handle
her
in
all
weathers
also
his
respect
for
captain
eri
developed
into
a
liking
captain
perez
was
gratified
and
delighted
at
the
change
in
his
grandnephew
behavior
and
manners
and
was
not
a
little
curious
to
learn
the
methods
by
which
the
result
had
been
brought
about
his
hints
being
fruitless
he
finally
asked
his
friend
captain
answer
was
something
like
this
perez
he
said
do
you
remember
old
man
sanborn
that
kept
school
here
when
you
and
me
was
boys
well
when
the
old
man
run
foul
of
a
youngster
that
was
sassy
and
uppish
he
knocked
the
sass
out
of
him
fust
and
then
talked
to
him
like
a
dutch
uncle
he
used
to
call
that
kind
of
treatment
suasion
that
what
i
doin
to
josiah
i
suasionin
captain
perez
was
a
little
anxious
concerning
the
first
part
of
this
course
of
training
but
its
results
were
so
satisfactory
that
he
asked
no
more
questions
the
fact
is
captain
perez
mind
was
too
much
occupied
with
another
subject
just
at
this
time
to
allow
him
to
be
the
other
subject
was
miss
patience
davis
miss
davis
her
visit
with
her
brother
being
over
was
acting
as
companion
to
an
old
lady
who
lived
in
a
little
house
up
the
shore
a
mile
or
so
above
the
station
this
elderly
female
whose
name
was
mayo
had
a
son
who
kept
a
grocery
store
in
the
village
and
was
therefore
obliged
to
be
away
all
day
and
until
late
in
the
evening
miss
patience
found
mayo
crotchets
a
bit
trying
but
the
work
was
easy
and
to
her
liking
and
she
was
as
she
said
right
across
the
way
as
you
might
say
from
the
way
referred
to
was
the
stretch
of
water
between
the
outer
beach
and
the
mainland
and
captain
perez
was
much
interested
in
miss
patience
very
much
so
indeed
his
frequent
visits
to
the
mayo
homestead
furnished
no
end
of
amusement
to
captain
eri
and
also
to
captain
jerry
who
found
poking
fun
at
his
friend
an
agreeable
change
from
the
old
programme
of
being
the
butt
himself
he
was
entirely
free
from
this
persecution
however
for
eri
more
than
once
asked
him
in
tones
the
sarcasm
of
which
was
elaborately
veiled
if
his
scheme
had
gotten
tired
and
was
sitting
down
to
rest
to
which
the
sacrifice
would
reply
stoutly
oh
it
comin
out
all
right
you
wait
and
but
in
his
heart
captain
jerry
knew
better
he
had
been
wise
enough
to
say
nothing
to
his
friends
concerning
his
interviews
with
elsie
and
ralph
but
apparently
the
between
the
pair
was
final
hazeltine
called
occasionally
it
is
true
but
his
stays
were
short
and
at
the
slightest
inclination
shown
by
the
older
people
to
leave
the
room
he
left
the
house
there
was
some
comment
by
eri
and
mrs
snow
on
this
sudden
change
but
they
were
far
from
suspecting
the
real
reason
elsie
continued
to
be
as
reticent
as
she
had
been
of
late
her
school
work
was
easier
now
that
josiah
was
no
longer
a
pupil
christmas
was
rather
a
failure
there
were
presents
of
course
but
the
planned
festivities
were
omitted
owing
to
a
change
in
john
condition
from
growing
gradually
better
he
now
grew
slowly
but
surely
worse
palmer
calls
were
more
frequent
and
he
did
not
conceal
from
mrs
snow
or
the
captains
his
anxiety
they
hid
much
of
this
from
elsie
but
she
too
noticed
the
change
and
was
evidently
worried
by
it
strange
to
say
as
his
strength
ebbed
the
patient
mind
grew
clearer
his
speech
that
in
his
intervals
of
consciousness
had
heretofore
dealt
with
events
of
the
past
was
now
more
concerned
with
recent
happenings
but
captain
eri
had
never
heard
him
mention
the
fire
one
afternoon
in
january
mrs
snow
and
captain
eri
were
together
in
the
sick
room
the
rest
of
the
household
was
absent
on
various
errands
captain
perez
paying
a
visit
to
the
sister
and
elsie
staying
after
school
to
go
over
some
examination
papers
there
was
snow
on
the
ground
and
a
jinooary
thaw
was
causing
the
eaves
to
drip
and
the
puddles
in
the
road
to
grow
larger
the
door
of
the
big
stove
was
open
and
the
coals
within
showed
captain
baxter
was
apparently
asleep
let
me
see
said
mrs
snow
musingly
in
a
low
tone
i
been
here
now
two
three
over
four
months
seems
longer
seems
almost
as
if
you
always
been
here
replied
captain
eri
queer
how
soon
we
git
used
to
a
change
i
do
know
how
we
got
along
afore
but
we
did
some
way
or
other
if
you
call
it
gittin
along
he
added
with
a
shrug
i
should
hate
to
have
to
try
it
over
it
always
seemed
funny
to
me
remarked
the
lady
that
you
men
all
sailors
so
and
used
to
doin
for
yourselves
should
have
had
such
a
time
when
you
come
to
try
keepin
house
i
should
have
expected
it
if
you
was
well
doctors
or
somethin
like
that
used
to
havin
folks
wait
on
you
but
all
sea
captains
it
seems
it
does
do
it
i
thought
of
that
myself
anybody
think
we
was
the
most
lot
that
ever
lived
but
we
even
jerry
and
he
the
wust
one
of
the
three
when
it
comes
to
leavin
things
at
loose
ends
always
had
a
mighty
neat
vessel
and
had
the
name
of
makin
his
crews
toe
the
mark
i
honestly
it
come
of
us
bein
on
shore
and
runnin
the
shebang
on
a
share
and
share
alike
idee
if
there
been
a
skipper
a
feller
to
boss
things
we
have
done
better
but
when
all
hands
was
boss
nobody
felt
like
doin
anything
then
too
we
begun
too
old
a
feller
gits
sort
of
sot
in
his
ways
and
it
hard
to
give
in
to
the
other
chap
now
take
that
marryin
idee
he
went
on
i
laughed
at
that
a
good
deal
at
fust
and
did
really
take
any
stock
in
it
but
i
guess
was
real
hoss
sense
after
all
anyhow
it
brought
you
down
here
and
what
we
done
without
you
when
john
was
took
sick
do
know
i
said
much
about
it
but
i
felt
enough
and
i
know
the
other
fellers
feel
the
same
way
you
been
so
mighty
good
and
put
up
with
so
many
things
that
must
have
fretted
you
like
the
nation
and
the
way
managed
my
the
admiration
in
the
captain
voice
made
the
housekeeper
blush
like
a
girl
do
say
a
word
eri
she
protested
it
been
jest
a
pleasure
to
me
honest
i
had
more
comfort
and
well
peace
you
might
say
sence
i
been
in
this
house
than
i
had
afore
for
when
i
think
said
the
captain
of
what
we
might
have
got
for
that
advertisement
i
swan
it
makes
my
hair
curl
advertisin
that
way
in
that
kind
of
a
paper
why
we
might
have
had
a
a
play
actress
or
i
do
know
what
landed
on
us
seems
if
there
was
a
providence
in
it
seems
if
you
was
kind
of
sent
there
i
do
know
what
you
must
think
of
me
answerin
an
advertisement
for
a
husband
that
way
it
makes
me
of
myself
when
i
think
of
it
i
declare
and
in
that
kind
of
a
paper
i
wondered
more
times
than
a
few
how
you
ever
got
a
hold
of
that
paper
one
you
see
every
day
you
mrs
snow
paused
before
she
answered
then
she
said
slowly
well
you
ai
asked
that
afore
i
have
said
much
about
myself
sence
i
been
here
for
no
reason
that
i
know
of
except
that
there
was
much
to
tell
and
it
was
a
very
interestin
yarn
to
other
folks
my
husband
name
was
jubal
snow
you
do
say
exclaimed
the
captain
why
jerry
used
to
know
i
should
wonder
jubal
knew
a
lot
of
folks
on
the
cape
here
he
was
a
good
husband
no
better
anywheres
and
he
and
i
had
a
good
life
together
long
as
he
was
well
i
sailed
a
good
many
with
him
and
i
feel
pretty
nigh
as
much
at
home
on
the
water
as
i
do
on
land
our
trouble
was
the
same
that
a
good
many
folks
have
we
did
that
fair
weather
would
last
all
the
time
that
all
it
was
his
fault
any
more
than
was
mine
we
saved
a
little
money
but
not
enough
as
it
turned
out
well
he
was
took
down
sick
and
had
to
give
up
goin
to
sea
and
we
had
a
little
place
over
in
nantucket
and
settled
down
on
it
fust
along
jubal
was
able
to
do
a
little
and
so
on
and
we
got
along
pretty
well
but
by
and
by
he
got
so
he
able
to
work
and
then
was
harder
what
little
we
saved
went
for
doctor
bills
and
this
that
and
he
did
like
to
have
me
leave
him
so
i
could
earn
much
of
anything
and
we
come
to
where
somethin
had
to
be
done
right
away
and
we
talked
the
thing
over
and
decided
to
mortgage
the
house
the
money
we
got
on
the
mortgage
lasted
until
he
died
he
had
a
little
life
insurance
not
enough
of
course
but
a
little
he
was
plannin
to
take
on
more
but
somehow
it
never
seemed
as
if
he
could
die
he
so
big
and
strong
and
we
put
it
off
until
he
got
so
he
pass
the
examination
when
the
insurance
money
come
i
took
it
to
jedge
briar
a
mighty
good
friend
of
jubal
and
mine
and
the
one
that
held
the
mortgage
on
the
house
and
i
told
him
i
wanted
to
pay
off
the
mortgage
with
it
so
i
have
the
house
free
and
clear
but
the
jedge
advised
me
not
to
said
the
mortgage
was
costin
me
only
six
per
and
why
did
i
put
the
money
where
was
likely
to
be
a
good
investment
that
would
pay
me
eight
or
ten
per
then
i
be
money
he
said
i
asked
him
to
invest
it
for
me
and
he
put
it
into
the
bay
shore
land
company
where
most
of
his
own
sho
i
want
to
know
broke
in
the
captain
he
did
hey
well
i
had
some
there
too
and
so
did
perez
precious
few
on
the
cape
that
yes
he
thought
was
the
safest
and
best
place
he
knew
of
the
officers
bein
sons
of
cape
people
and
their
fathers
such
fine
men
everybody
said
was
all
right
i
got
my
dividends
for
a
while
and
i
went
out
nussin
and
did
sewin
and
got
along
reel
well
i
kept
thinkin
some
day
i
be
able
to
pay
off
the
mortgage
and
i
put
away
what
little
i
could
towards
it
but
then
was
took
sick
and
that
money
went
and
then
the
land
company
went
up
the
the
captain
nodded
the
failure
of
the
company
had
brought
poverty
to
hundreds
of
widows
mrs
snow
case
was
but
another
instance
let
me
see
said
the
lady
where
was
i
oh
yes
the
land
failin
well
it
failed
and
the
insurance
money
went
with
it
it
was
discouragin
of
course
but
i
had
my
house
except
for
the
mortgage
and
i
had
my
health
again
and
if
i
do
say
it
i
ai
afraid
of
work
so
i
jest
made
up
my
mind
there
was
no
use
cryin
over
spilt
milk
and
that
i
must
git
along
and
begin
to
save
all
over
again
then
jedge
briar
died
and
his
nephew
up
to
boston
come
into
the
property
i
was
behind
in
my
payments
a
little
and
they
sent
me
word
they
should
foreclose
the
mortgage
and
they
well
i
swan
the
mean
sculpins
did
you
have
nobody
you
could
go
to
no
relations
nor
nothin
i
got
a
brother
out
in
chicago
but
he
married
rich
and
his
wife
does
care
much
for
her
husband
relations
i
never
saw
her
but
once
and
then
one
of
the
first
things
she
asked
me
was
if
it
was
true
that
there
was
more
crazy
people
in
nantucket
than
in
any
other
place
of
its
size
on
earth
and
afore
i
could
answer
she
asked
me
what
made
crazy
i
told
her
i
did
know
unless
it
was
answerin
city
questions
she
did
like
that
very
well
and
i
have
heard
from
job
that
my
brother
for
a
long
time
all
my
other
near
relations
are
dead
so
they
foreclosed
the
mortgage
and
gave
me
notice
to
move
out
i
packed
my
things
and
watered
my
flowers
i
had
quite
a
pretty
flower
garden
for
the
last
time
and
then
come
in
and
set
down
in
the
rocker
to
wait
for
the
wagon
that
was
goin
to
move
me
i
got
to
thinkin
how
proud
jubal
and
me
was
when
we
bought
that
house
and
how
we
planned
about
fixin
it
up
and
how
our
baby
that
died
was
born
in
it
and
how
jubal
himself
had
died
there
and
told
me
that
he
was
glad
he
was
leavin
me
a
home
at
any
rate
and
i
got
so
lonesome
and
discouraged
that
i
jest
cried
i
could
help
it
but
i
never
found
that
did
much
good
so
i
wiped
my
eyes
and
looked
for
somethin
to
read
to
take
up
my
mind
and
that
chime
paper
was
what
i
took
up
you
see
there
been
a
big
excursion
from
boston
down
the
day
before
and
some
of
the
folks
come
down
my
way
to
have
a
sort
of
picnic
two
of
factory
girls
from
brockton
they
was
come
to
the
house
for
a
drink
of
water
they
were
gigglin
foolish
enough
critters
but
i
asked
in
and
they
eat
their
lunches
on
my
table
they
left
two
or
three
story
papers
and
that
chime
thing
when
they
went
away
well
i
looked
it
over
and
almost
the
first
thing
i
saw
was
that
advertisement
signed
it
did
read
like
the
other
trashy
things
in
there
and
it
sounded
honest
and
all
of
a
sudden
it
come
over
me
that
i
answer
it
i
was
lonesome
and
tired
and
sort
of
did
care
and
i
answered
it
right
off
without
waitin
another
minute
that
all
there
is
to
tell
when
i
come
here
to
be
housekeeper
i
wrote
the
folks
that
takin
care
of
my
furniture
they
reel
kind
people
i
was
goin
to
board
there
if
i
had
stayed
in
nantucket
to
keep
it
till
i
come
back
there
i
meant
to
tell
you
this
long
ago
and
i
do
know
why
i
the
captain
knew
why
she
had
it
was
easy
to
read
between
the
lines
the
tale
of
the
years
of
disappointment
and
anxiety
such
stories
are
not
easy
to
tell
and
he
respected
the
widow
more
than
ever
for
the
simple
way
in
which
she
had
told
hers
that
land
company
he
said
carried
off
a
good
lot
of
cape
cod
money
i
never
saw
but
one
man
that
i
thought
was
glad
it
busted
and
that
was
old
caleb
weeks
over
to
harniss
the
old
man
was
rich
but
closer
the
bark
of
a
tree
he
skin
a
flea
for
the
hide
and
taller
and
used
to
be
a
hard
case
into
the
bargain
one
time
they
had
a
big
revival
over
there
and
he
got
religion
the
boys
used
to
say
what
caught
caleb
was
the
minister
sayin
salvation
was
free
well
anyhow
he
got
converted
and
the
church
that
was
all
right
only
while
the
fit
was
fresh
he
pledged
himself
to
give
five
hundred
dollars
to
help
build
the
new
chapel
when
he
cooled
down
a
little
he
was
sorry
and
every
time
they
hint
at
his
comin
down
with
the
cash
he
back
and
fill
and
put
it
off
for
a
spell
when
the
land
company
went
up
he
was
the
only
happy
one
in
town
he
said
he
lost
all
his
money
course
under
the
circumstances
they
could
ask
him
to
pay
so
he
did
from
what
i
hear
he
lost
as
much
as
fifty
they
both
laughed
and
mrs
snow
was
about
to
answer
when
she
was
interrupted
eri
said
a
weak
voice
the
captain
started
turned
sharply
and
saw
the
sick
man
watching
him
his
eyes
fixed
and
unwavering
eri
said
john
baxter
again
come
mrs
snow
hurried
to
her
patient
but
the
latter
impatiently
bade
her
let
him
alone
not
you
he
said
i
want
captain
eri
stooped
down
beside
the
bed
what
is
it
john
he
asked
eri
god
called
you
to
break
man
law
and
keep
his
what
would
you
do
the
captain
glanced
anxiously
at
the
then
he
said
soothingly
oh
that
all
right
john
do
worry
that
you
and
me
settled
that
long
ago
how
are
you
feelin
now
i
know
i
know
with
the
monotonous
persistence
of
those
whose
minds
are
wandering
and
then
cleanly
once
more
eri
i
been
that
all
right
john
that
all
right
do
you
want
mrs
snow
to
fix
your
piller
you
lay
a
little
easier
then
now
mrs
snow
if
you
jest
turn
it
while
i
lift
him
so
better
now
ai
it
shipmate
hey
but
the
sick
man
muttered
an
unintelligible
something
and
relapsed
once
more
into
the
that
was
his
usual
state
captain
eri
sighed
in
relief
that
was
queer
it
he
observed
he
had
two
or
three
of
those
spells
in
the
last
day
or
two
was
the
answer
the
captain
wondered
what
his
friend
might
have
said
during
those
spells
but
he
was
afraid
to
inquire
instead
he
asked
what
did
the
doctor
say
when
he
was
here
this
mornin
nothin
very
hopeful
i
asked
him
plain
what
he
thought
of
the
case
and
he
answered
jest
as
plain
he
said
baxter
had
failed
dreadful
in
the
last
week
and
that
he
would
be
if
he
dropped
off
most
any
time
then
again
he
said
he
might
live
for
i
see
i
they
were
silent
for
a
while
watching
the
sick
man
whose
sleep
or
stupor
was
not
as
tranquil
as
usual
two
or
three
times
his
eyes
opened
and
he
muttered
audibly
i
never
saw
him
so
restless
afore
commented
captain
eri
anxiously
he
was
so
last
did
elsie
see
him
no
i
was
alone
here
and
she
was
asleep
in
the
next
room
i
got
up
and
shut
the
the
captain
glanced
keenly
at
the
housekeeper
but
her
face
was
placid
and
inscrutable
he
shifted
uneasily
and
then
said
elsie
late
ai
she
i
wonder
what
keepin
school
work
i
she
workin
harder
she
ought
to
i
fire
the
word
was
shouted
and
the
room
rang
with
it
john
baxter
whose
weakness
had
hitherto
been
so
great
that
he
could
not
turn
himself
in
bed
was
leaning
on
his
elbow
and
pointing
with
outstretched
finger
to
the
open
stove
door
fire
he
shouted
again
it
blazin
it
burnin
it
wipin
the
plague

burnt
up
and
the
ways
of
the
wicked
sha
they
forced
him
back
on
the
pillow
but
he
fought
them
fiercely
for
a
moment
or
two
after
they
thought
they
had
quieted
him
he
broke
out
again
talking
rapidly
and
clearly
i
hear
the
call
lord
he
said
i
thank
thee
for
showin
it
to

your
book

and

entreated
the
captain
where
the
kerosene
continued
the
old
man
and
the
matches
now
softly

the
shavin
it
dark
here
in
the
corner

the
agonized
captain
eri
hush
john

still
there
there
baxter
said
mrs
snow
soothingly
laying
her
hand
on
the
sick
man
forehead
somehow
the
touch
seemed
to
quiet
him
his
eyes
lost
their
fire
and
he
muttered
absently
that
he
was
tired
then
the
eyes
closed
and
he
lay
still
breathing
heavily
land
of
love
exclaimed
the
captain
that
was
awful
had
i
better
go
for
the
doctor
i
do
think
so
unless
he
gits
worse
he
had
jest
such
a
turn
as
i
told
you
last
did
he
talk
like
he
did
jest
now
jest
the
the
same
things
the
captain
gasped
then
you
knew
he
said
that
he
set
the
billiard
room
afire
yes
i
always
rather
suspicioned
that
he
did
and
last

sence
that
night
he
was
found
he
had
his
coat
on
when
i
found
him
and
was
all
burnt
and
there
was
an
empty
kerosene
bottle
in
his
pocket
i
hid
the
coat
and
threw
the
bottle
away
and
turned
him
so
he
was
facin
towards
the
saloon
of
from
it
and
i
lied
when
i
told
the
doctor
that
he
was
jest
as
he
fell
there
the
murder
out
now
what
do

i
sartinly
well
i
snum

over
that
thing
time
and
time
again
and

sort
of
a
firebug

sometimes
i
heard
folks
layin
it
to
fust
one
and
then
the
other
and
that
web
did
it
himself
to
git
the
insurance
and

time

who
really
did
do
it
and
have
said
anything
i
jest

same

into
by
bein
well
out
of
his
head
why
land
of
mercy

ai
no
more
to
be
held
responsible
than
a
baby
you
did
what
i
have
done
if
i
been
in
your
place
and
i
respect
you
for
the
captain
voice
shook
as
he
answered
marthy
snow
he
said
you
the
kind
of
woman
that
i
like
to
have
had
for
a
it
was
perhaps
a
later
when
captain
eri
started
for
the
schoolhouse
to
bring
elsie
home
john
baxter
had
not
wakened
and
mrs
snow
said
she
was
not
afraid
to
remain
alone
with
him
the
thaw
had
turned
to
a
light
rain
and
the
captain
carried
an
umbrella
it
was
dark
by
this
time
and
when
he
came
in
sight
of
the
schoolhouse
he
saw
a
light
in
the
window
one
of
the
scholars
a
by
no
means
brilliant
one
whose
principal
educational
achievement
was
the
frequency
with
which
he
succeeded
in
being
kept
after
school
was
seated
on
the
fence
doing
his
best
to
whittle
it
to
pieces
with
a
new
jackknife
hello
sonny
said
the
captain
miss
preston
gone
yit
no
she
ai
replied
the
boy
continuing
to
whittle
she
up
there
saunders
is
there
saunders
web
saunders
yup
i
see
him
go
in
there
a
little
while
captain
eri
started
toward
the
schoolhouse
at
a
rapid
pace
then
he
suddenly
stopped
and
then
as
suddenly
walked
on
again
all
at
once
he
dropped
his
umbrella
and
struck
one
hand
into
the
palm
of
the
other
with
a
smack
when
he
reached
the
door
he
leaned
the
umbrella
in
the
corner
and
walked
up
the
stairs
very
softly
indeed
chapter
xvi
a
business
call
that
enterprising
business
man
web
saunders
opened
the
door
of
his
renovated
billiard
room
a
little
later
than
usual
the
next
morning
it
was
common
report
about
the
village
that
saunders
occasionally
sampled
the
contents
of
some
of
the
original
packages
which
bearing
the
name
and
address
of
a
boston
wholesale
liquor
dealer
came
to
him
by
express
at
irregular
intervals
it
was
also
reported
probably
by
unreliable
total
abstainers
that
during
these
sampling
seasons
his
temper
was
not
of
the
best
perhaps
saunders
might
have
said
something
concerning
this
report
if
she
had
been
so
disposed
but
unless
a
discolored
eye
might
be
taken
as
evidence
she
never
offered
any
the
injury
to
her
eye
she
explained
by
saying
that
something
flew
up
and
hit
this
was
no
doubt
true
but
gossip
aside
saunders
did
not
seem
in
good
humor
on
this
particular
morning
a
yellow
cur
of
nondescript
breed
taken
since
the
fire
in
payment
of
a
debt
from
squealer
wixon
who
had
described
it
as
a
watchdog
rose
from
its
bed
behind
the
cigar
counter
yawned
stretched
and
came
slinking
over
to
greet
its
master
web
forcibly
hoisted
it
out
of
the
door
on
the
toe
of
his
boot
its
yelp
of
pained
surprise
seemed
to
afford
the
business
man
considerable
relief
for
he
moved
more
briskly
afterward
and
proceeded
to
sweep
the
floor
with
some
degree
of
speed
the
forenoon
trade
at
the
billiard
room
was
never
very
lively
and
this
forenoon
was
no
exception
bluey
batcheldor
drifted
in
stepped
into
the
little
room
the
door
of
which
was
lettered
ice
cream
parlor
and
busied
himself
with
a
glass
and
bottle
for
a
few
moments
then
he
helped
himself
to
a
cigar
from
the
showcase
and
told
his
friend
to
chalk
it
this
saunders
did
seem
to
care
to
do
and
there
was
a
lively
argument
at
length
bluey
promise
to
square
up
in
a
day
or
so
was
accepted
under
protest
and
the
customer
departed
at
eleven
the
man
of
business
was
dozing
in
a
chair
by
the
stove
and
the
watchdog
having
found
it
chilly
outside
and
venturing
in
was
dozing
near
him
the
bell
attached
to
the
door
rang
vigorously
and
both
dog
and
man
awoke
with
a
start
the
visitor
was
captain
eri
now
the
captain
was
perhaps
the
last
person
whom
the
proprietor
of
the
billiard
room
expected
to
see
but
a
stranger
never
would
have
guessed
it
in
fact
the
stranger
might
reasonably
have
supposed
that
the
visitor
was
saunders
dearest
friend
and
that
his
call
was
a
pleasure
long
looked
forward
to
why
exclaimed
web
how
are
you
put
her
there
i
glad
to
see
you
lookin
so
well
i
said
to
the
other
day
i
never
see
a
man
hold
his
age
like
hedge
i
be
blessed
if
he
looks
a
day
over
forty
i
says
take
off
your
coat
you
somehow
or
other
the
captain
must
have
lost
sight
of
web
extended
hand
certainly
the
hand
was
large
enough
to
be
seen
but
he
did
not
take
it
he
did
however
accept
the
invitation
to
remove
his
coat
and
slipping
out
of
the
faded
brown
pea
jacket
threw
it
on
a
settee
at
the
side
of
the
room
his
face
was
stern
and
his
manner
quiet
and
in
spite
of
saunders
flattering
reference
to
his
youthful
appearance
this
morning
he
looked
at
least
more
than
a
day
past
forty
but
if
captain
eri
was
more
than
usually
quiet
and
reserved
web
was
unchanged
and
if
he
noticed
that
the
handshake
was
declined
said
nothing
about
it
his
smile
was
sweetness
itself
as
he
observed
well
mighty
weather
we
having
for
this
time
of
year
it
what
new
down
your
way
that
right
have
a
the
captain
had
no
doubt
anticipated
this
cordial
invitation
for
he
seated
himself
before
it
was
given
and
crossing
his
legs
extended
his
dripping
rubber
boots
toward
the
fire
the
rain
was
still
falling
and
it
beat
against
the
windows
of
the
saloon
in
gusts
web
said
captain
eri
set
down
a
minute
i
want
to
talk
to
why

exclaimed
the
genial
man
of
business
pulling
up
another
chair

a

often

was
the
answer
i
smoke
my
pipe
if
it
all
the
same
to
saunders
did
mind
in
the
least
but
thought
he
would
have
a
cigar
himself
so
he
lit
one
and
smoked
in
silence
as
the
captain
filled
his
pipe
web
knew
that
this
was
something
more
than
an
ordinary
social
visit
captain
eri
calls
at
the
billiard
room
were
few
and
far
between
the
captain
for
his
part
knew
what
his
companion
was
thinking
and
the
pair
watched
each
other
through
the
smoke
the
pipe
drew
well
and
the
captain
sent
a
blue
cloud
whirling
toward
the
ceiling
then
he
asked
suddenly
web
how
much
money
has
elsie
preston
paid
you
altogether
saunders
started
the
least
bit
and
his
small
eyes
narrowed
a
trifle
but
the
innocent
surprise
in
his
reply
was
a
treat
to
hear
elsie
paid
me
he
asked
yes

she

said

but
i
do

i
was
in
the
entry
upstairs
at
the
schoolhouse
for
about
ten
minutes
last
saunders
start
was
perceptible
this
time
he
stood
for
a
moment
without
speaking
then
he
jerked
the
chair
around
threw
himself
into
it
and
said
cautiously
well
what
of
it
i
come
up
from
the
house
to
git
elsie
home

rainin
i
was
told

i
thought

somethin
crooked
on

had
a
suspicion

so
when
i
got
up
to
the
door

did

that

takin
money
from
that
girl
right
along
and
i
think
i
know
you
do
hey
then
saunders
asked
the
question
that
a
bigger
rascal
than
he
had
asked
some
years
before
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
took
a
pull
at
his
cigar
and
said
sneeringly
well
what
are
you
goin
to
do
it
i
goin
to
stop
it
and
i
goin
to
make
you
give
the
money
back
how
much
has
she
paid
you
none
of
your
d
n
the
captain
rose
to
his
feet
saunders
sprang
up
also
and
reached
for
the
coal
shovel
evidently
expecting
trouble
but
if
he
feared
a
physical
assault
his
fear
was
groundless
captain
eri
merely
took
up
his
coat
maybe
it
ai
none
of
my
he
said
i
ai
a
nor
sheriff
but
there
such
things
in
town
and
they
be
seems
to
me
that
i
heard
that
blackmailin
has
got
folks
into
state
prison
afore
is
that
so
never
heard
that
folks
that
set
fire
to
other
got
there
did
you
yes
and
folks
that
helps
gits
there
too
sometimes
who
was
it
hid
a
coat
a
spell
ago
it
was
captain
eri
turn
to
start
he
hesitated
a
moment
tossed
the
pea
jacket
back
on
the
settee
and
sat
down
once
more
saunders
watched
him
grinning
triumphantly
well
he
said
with
a
sneer
a
coat
you
say
yes
a
coat
maybe
you
know
who
hid
it
i
can
guess
myself
that
coat
was
burned
some
how
do
you
it
got
burned
and
say
who
used
to
wear
a
big
white
hat
round
these
diggin
ah
ha
who
did
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
captain
start
this
time
he
wheeled
sharply
in
his
chair
and
looked
at
the
speaker
humph
he
exclaimed
you
found
that
hat
did
you
that
what
i
done
and
where
do
you
think
i
found
it
why
right
at
the
back
of
my
shed
where
the
fire
started
and
there
been
a
pile
of
shavin
there
too
and
there
been
kerosene
on
who
smashed
the
bottle
over
in
the
field
hey
captain
eri
seemed
to
be
thinking
web
evidently
set
his
own
interpretation
on
this
silence
for
he
went
on
raising
his
voice
as
he
did
so
did
you
think
i
was
fool
enough
not
to
know
who
set
that
fire
i
knew
the
night
she
burned
and
when
i
met
palmer
jest
comin
from
your
house
and
he
told
me
how
old
baxter
was
took
sick
goin
to
the
fire
oh
yes
goin
i
went
up
on
that
hill
right
off
and
i
hunted
and
i
found
things
and
what
i
found
i
kept
and
what
i
found
when
i
pulled
that
burned
shed
to
pieces
i
kept
too
and
i
got
yit
you
have
hey
dear
dear
you
bet
i
have
and
somebody
goin
to
pay
for
goin
to
pay
pay
pay
is
that
plain
the
captain
made
no
answer
he
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
looked
at
the
stove
dolefully
so
it
seemed
to
the
man
of
business
fust
off
i
thought
i
have
the
old
cuss
jailed
continued
saunders
then
thinks
i
that
wo
pay
me
for
my
buildin
and
my
hurt
and
all
that
so
i
waited
for
baxter
to
git
well
to
make
him
pay
or
go
to
the
jug
but
he
stayed
sick
i
the
mean
captain

moved
uneasily
and
broke
in

but
whose
fault
is
that
his

any

with

now
which
it
be
think
web
triumphant
expression
was
gone
and
rage
and
malice
had
taken
its
place
he
saw
now
that
the
captain
had
tricked
him
into
telling
more
than
he
ought
but
he
burst
out
again
tripping
over
words
in
his
excitement
think
he
yelled

a
firebug

at
him
he
died
jest
afore
i
left
the
saunders
brandished
fist
fell
heavily
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
his
face
turned
white
in
patches
and
then
flamed
red
again
died
he
gasped
you
you
a
liar

i
ai
john
baxter

was
a
chum
of
mine

after
him
i
have
been
here
long
afore

the
captain
voice
shook
but
he
restrained
himself
and
went
on
now
you
see
where
you
stand
do
you
long
john

the
proof
to

poor
feller
and
all
your
proof
ai
worth
a
cent
not
one
red
cent
understand
it
was
quite
evident
that
saunders
did
understand
for
his
countenance
showed
it
but
the
bluster
was
not
out
of
him
yet
all
right
he
said
anyhow
the
girl

her
granddad

for
what
he
was
and
i
show

he
shouted
as
this
possibility
began
to
dawn
on
him
i
let
folks

that
coat
and
and
all
the
rest
of
no

with
me
and
i
ai
sick
if

i
walk
straight
to
jedge

and
i
tell

i
tell

how
you
bullied
money
out
of
that
girl
that
had
no
more
to
do
with
the
fire
than
a
baby
if
it
comes
to
facin
a
jury
i
take
my
chances
but
how
you
you
runnin
a
town
nuisance
that
the
are
talkin
of
already
sellin
rum
by
the
drink
when
your
license
says
it
sha
be
sold
by
the
bottle
where
your
character
land
you
on
a
charge
of
blackmail
and
another
thing
the
folks
in
this
town
knew
john
baxter
afore
he
was
like
what
he
been
lately
a
good
many
of
swore
by
him
yes
sir
by
mighty
some
of
loved
him
this
is
a
town
but
jest
i
should
go
to
some
of
the
fellers
that
used
to
sail
with
him
and
tell
what
you
been
up
to
think
you
stay
here
long
think
you
move
out
on
a
captain
eri
paused
and
sat
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
grimly
watching
his
opponent
whose
turn
for
thinking
had
come
the
face
of
the
billiard
magnate
was
an
interesting
study
in
expression
during
the
speech
from
excited
triumph
it
had
fallen
to
fear
and
dejection
and
now
out
of
the
wreck
was
appearing
once
more
the
oily
smile
the
sugared
sweetness
of
the
saunders
now
hedge
purred
the
reconstructed
one
you
and
me
has
always
been
good
friends
we
had
ought
to
fight
like
this
i
do
think
either
of
us
wants
to
go
to
court
let
see
if
we
ca
fix
the
thing
up
some
we
fix
it
up
when
you
pay
me
the
seventy
now
hedge
likely
i
got
seventy
dollars
in
my
pocket
seems
to
me
you
pretty
hard
on
a
poor
feller
that
jest
been
burnt
out
i
think
we
ought
to
how
much
have
you
got
after
a
good
deal
of
talk
and
protestation
saunders
acknowledged
being
the
possessor
of
dollars
divided
between
the
cash
drawer
and
his
pocket
this
he
reluctantly
handed
to
the
captain
then
the
captain
demanded
pen
ink
and
paper
and
when
they
were
brought
he
laboriously
wrote
out
a
screed
to
the
effect
that
webster
saunders
had
received
of
elsie
preston
dollars
which
sum
he
promised
to
pay
on
demand
there
he
said
pushing
the
writing
materials
across
the
table
sign
at
first
saunders
positively
refused
to
sign
then
he
intimated
that
he
had
rather
wait
and
think
it
over
a
little
while
finally
he
affixed
his
signature
and
spitefully
threw
the
pen
across
the
room
captain
eri
folded
up
the
paper
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
then
he
rose
and
put
on
his
pea
jacket
now
there
jest
one
thing
more
he
said
trot
out
that
coat
and
what
do
you
mean
trot
out
that
coat
and
hat
of
john
i
want
i
sha
do
all
right
then
it
all
off
i
step
over
and
see
the
jedge
hear
from
him
and
me
hold
on
a
minute
you
in
such
a
everlastin
hurry
i
care

old
duds
but
i
do

to
me
they
up
to
the
house
somewheres
i
give
to
you
you
give
to
me
right
now
i
tend
shop
while
you
go
after
for
a
moment
it
looked
as
though
the
man
of
business
would
rebel
outright
but
the
captain
was
so
calm
and
evidently
so
determined
to
do
exactly
what
he
promised
that
web
gave
up
in
despair
muttering
that
maybe
they
were
the
place
after
all
he
went
into
the
back
room
and
reappeared
with
the
burned
coat
and
the
scorched
white
felt
hat
slamming
them
down
on
the
counter
he
said
sulkily
there
they
be
any
more
of
my
you
like
to
have
captain
eri
did
answer
coolly
tearing
off
several
sheets
of
wrapping
paper
from
the
roll
at
the
back
of
the
counter
he
made
a
bundle
of
the
hat
and
coat
and
tucked
it
under
his
arm
then
he
put
on
his
own
hat
and
started
for
the
door
he
said
the
temper
of
the
exasperated
saunders
flared
up
in
a
final
outburst
you
think
you
almighty
smart
do
you
he
growled
between
his
teeth
i
square
up
with
you
by
and
the
captain
turned
sharply
his
hand
on
the
latch
i
wish
you
try
he
said
i
jest
wish
to
god
you
try
i
held
in
more
i
thought
i
could
when
i
come
up
here
but
if
you
want
to
start
a
reel
rumpus

that
land
you
where
you
and
rid
this
town
of
you
for
keeps

try
some
of
your
tricks
on
me
and
if
i
hear
of
one
word
that
you
said
this
whole
i
know
it
time
to
start
in
now
you
can
keep
still
or
fight
jest
as
you
please
i
tell
you
honest
i
wish
you
the
door
slammed
saunders
opened
it
again
and
gazed
vindictively
after
the
bulky
figure
splashing
through
the
slush
the
dog
came
sneaking
up
and
rubbed
his
nose
against
his
master
hand
it
was
an
impolitic
move
on
his
part
git
out
roared
web
delighted
at
the
opportunity
you
pup
how
that
set
that
was
a
kick
that
doubled
the
cur
up
against
the
settee
as
it
scrambled
to
its
feet
saunders
kicked
it
again
and
then
the
watchdog
exhibited
the
first
evidence
of
spirit
that
it
had
ever
been
known
to
show
with
a
snarl
as
the
man
turned
away
it
settled
its
teeth
into
the
calf
of
his
leg
and
then
shot
out
of
the
door
and
with
its
tail
between
its
legs
went
down
the
road
like
a
yellow
cannon
ball
chapter
xvii
through
fire
and
water
it
was
true
john
baxter
was
dead
his
violent
outbreak
of
the
previous
afternoon
had
hastened
the
end
that
the
doctor
had
prophesied
there
was
no
harrowing
death
scene
the
old
face
grew
calmer
and
the
sleep
sounder
until
the
tide
went
out
that
was
all
it
was
like
a
peaceful
coming
into
port
after
a
rough
voyage
no
one
of
the
watchers
about
the
bed
could
wish
him
back
not
even
elsie
who
was
calm
and
brave
through
it
all
when
it
was
over
she
went
to
her
room
and
mrs
snow
went
with
her
captain
eri
went
out
to
make
his
call
upon
saunders
the
funeral
was
one
of
the
largest
ever
held
in
orham
the
little
house
was
crowded
old
friends
who
had
drifted
away
from
the
fanatic
in
his
latter
days
came
back
to
pay
tribute
to
the
strong
man
whom
they
had
known
and
loved
there
was
some
discussion
among
the
captains
as
to
who
should
preach
the
funeral
sermon
elsie
had
left
this
question
to
captain
eri
for
settlement
and
the
trio
and
mrs
snow
went
into
executive
session
immediately
if
john
had
had
the
settlin
of
it
himself
observed
eri
he
have
picked
perley
there
ai
no
doubt
i
know
it
said
captain
perez
but
you
must
remember
that
john
himself
for
years
and
what
he
have
done
now
ai
what
he
have
done
he
broke
down
i
hate
to
think
of
perley
doin
it
is
perley
a
good
man
asked
the
housekeeper
he
good
enough
fur
i
know
replied
captain
jerry
but
i
know
what
perez
means
a
funeral
seems
to
me
ought
to
be
a
quiet
sort
of
a
thing
and
there
ai
nothin
soothin
preachin
he
beller
and
rave
i
and
stir
up
poor
elsie
so
she
wo
never
git
over
i
know
it
agreed
captain
eri
that
what
i
been
afraid
of
and
yit
he
added
i
should
feel
we
was
doin
somethin
jest
opposite
from
what
john
would
like
if
we
had
anybody
could
you
see
perley
beforehand
suggested
mrs
snow
and
tell
him
jest
the
kind
of
sermon
he
must
preach
tell
him
it
must
be
quiet
and
comfortin
and
and
captain
eri
finished
the
sentence
for
her
i
guess
the
way
we
have
to
settle
it
i
make
him
understand
one
thing
though
he
must
drag
in
rum
sellin
and
all
the
rest
of
it
by
the
heels
if
he
does
i
i
do
know
what
i
do
to
the
interview
with
the
reverend
perley
that
followed
this
conversation
must
have
been
effective
for
the
sermon
was
surprisingly
brief
and
as
surprisingly
calm
in
fact
so
rational
was
it
that
a
few
of
the
more
extreme
among
the
preacher
following
were
a
bit
disappointed
and
inquired
anxiously
as
to
their
leader
health
after
the
ceremony
was
over
the
procession
of
carryalls
and
buggies
followed
the
hearse
to
the
cemetery
among
the
pines
and
as
the
mourners
stood
about
the
grave
the
winter
wind
sang
through
the
evergreen
branches
a
song
so
like
the
roar
of
the
surf
that
it
seemed
like
a
dirge
of
the
sea
for
the
mariner
who
would
sail
no
more
as
they
were
clearing
away
the
supper
dishes
that
night
captain
eri
said
to
mrs
snow
well
john
gone
i
wonder
if
he
happier
now
than
he
has
been
for
the
last
ten
years
or
i
think
he
is
was
the
answer
well
so
do
i
but
if
he
had
been
a
outer
i
do
brother
perley
and
his
crowd
would
have
figgered
that
he
had
much
show
seems
sometimes
as
if
folks
like
that
reel
folks
too
that
would
hurt
a
fly
git
solid
comfort
out
of
the
feelin
that
everybody
that
do
agree
with
is
bound
to
everlastin
torment
i
do
know
but
it
wicked
to
say
it
but
honest
it
seems
as
if
them
kind
would
as
soon
give
up
the
hopes
of
heaven
for
themselves
as
they
would
the
satisfaction
of
knowin
was
place
for
the
other
to
which
remark
the
somewhat
shocked
housekeeper
made
no
reply
the
following
day
elsie
went
back
to
her
school
captain
eri
walked
up
with
her
and
on
the
way
told
her
of
his
discovery
of
her
secret
and
of
his
interview
with
web
saunders
it
was
exactly
as
the
captain
had
surmised
the
note
she
had
received
on
the
evening
of
the
return
from
the
station
was
from
the
proprietor
of
the
billiard
saloon
and
in
it
he
hinted
at
some
dire
calamity
that
overshadowed
her
grandfather
and
demanded
an
immediate
interview
she
had
seen
him
that
night
and
under
threat
of
instant
exposure
had
promised
to
pay
the
sum
required
for
silence
she
had
not
wished
to
use
her
grandfather
money
for
this
purpose
and
so
had
taken
the
position
as
teacher
well
said
the
captain
i
wish
you
have
come
to
me
right
away
and
told
me
the
whole
have
saved
a
pile
of
the
young
lady
stopped
short
and
faced
him
captain
eri
she
said
how
could
i
i
was
sure
grandfather
had
set
the
fire
i
knew
how
ill
he
was
and
i
knew
that
any
shock
might
kill
him
besides
how
could
i
drag
you
into
it
when
you
had
done
so
much
already
it
would
have
been
dreadful
no
i
thought
it
all
out
and
decided
i
must
face
it
well
i
tell
you
this
elsie
pretty
a
mean
dog
bite
if
he
sees
you
afraid
of
him
the
only
way
to
handle
that
kind
is
to
run
straight
at
him
and
kick
the
meanness
out
of
him
the
more
he
barks
the
harder
you
ought
to
kick
if
you
run
away
once
it
be
mighty
every
time
you
go
past
that
house
but
never
mind
i
this
pup
wo
bite
i
pulled
his
teeth
i
guess
what
your
plans
now
goin
to
keep
on
with
the
school
or
go
back
to
boston
miss
preston
did
know
she
said
she
had
not
yet
decided
and
as
the
schoolhouse
was
reached
by
this
time
the
captain
said
no
more
there
was
however
another
question
that
troubled
him
and
that
seemed
to
call
for
almost
immediate
settlement
it
was
what
should
be
done
with
mrs
snow
the
housekeeper
had
been
hired
to
act
as
such
while
john
baxter
was
in
the
house
now
he
was
gone
and
there
remained
the
original
marriage
agreement
between
captain
jerry
and
the
widow
and
honor
called
for
a
decision
one
way
or
the
other
mrs
snow
of
course
said
nothing
about
it
neither
did
captain
jerry
and
captain
eri
felt
that
he
must
take
the
initiative
as
usual
but
somehow
he
was
not
as
prompt
as
was
his
wont
and
sat
evening
after
evening
whittling
at
the
clipper
and
smoking
thoughtfully
and
another
week
went
by
captain
perez
might
and
probably
would
have
suggested
action
upon
this
important
matter
had
not
his
mind
been
taken
up
with
what
to
him
was
the
most
important
of
all
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
ask
patience
davis
to
marry
him
love
is
like
the
measles
it
goes
hard
with
a
man
past
fifty
and
captain
perez
was
severely
smitten
the
decision
just
mentioned
was
not
exactly
a
one
his
mind
had
been
made
up
for
some
time
but
he
lacked
the
courage
to
ask
the
momentous
question
something
the
lady
had
said
during
the
first
stages
of
their
acquaintance
made
a
great
impression
on
the
captain
she
gave
it
as
her
opinion
that
a
man
who
loved
a
woman
should
be
willing
to
go
through
fire
and
water
to
win
her
captain
perez
went
home
that
night
pondering
deeply
fire
and
water
he
mused
that
a
turrible
test
but
she
a
wonderful
woman
and
would
expect
it
of
a
feller
i
wonder
if
i
could
do
it
seems
if
i
would
now
but
flesh
is
weak
and
i
might
flunk
and
that
would
settle
it
fire
and
water
my
my
that
awful
so
the
captain
delayed
and
miss
patience
who
had
cherished
hopes
found
need
of
a
good
share
of
the
virtue
for
which
she
was
named
but
one
afternoon
at
the
end
of
the
week
following
that
of
the
funeral
perez
set
out
for
a
call
upon
his
intended
which
he
meant
should
be
a
decisive
one
he
had
screwed
his
courage
up
to
the
top
notch
and
as
he
told
captain
eri
afterwards
he
meant
to
hail
her
and
git
his
bearin
if
he
foundered
the
next
he
found
the
lady
alone
for
old
mayo
had
gone
with
her
son
whose
name
was
abner
to
visit
a
cousin
in
harniss
and
would
not
be
back
until
late
in
the
evening
miss
patience
was
very
glad
to
have
company
and
it
required
no
great
amount
of
urging
to
persuade
the
infatuated
swain
to
stay
to
tea
when
the
meal
was
over
they
washed
the
dishes
together
and
the
captain
was
so
nervous
that
it
is
a
wonder
there
was
a
whole
plate
left
the
pair
were
seated
in
the
parlor
then
said
captain
perez
turning
red
and
hesitating
pashy
do
you
know
what
a
feller
told
me
you
now
this
remark
was
purely
a
pleasant
fiction
for
the
captain
was
about
to
undertake
a
compliment
and
was
rather
afraid
to
shoulder
the
entire
responsibility
no
i
sure
i
do
perez
replied
miss
davis
smiling
sweetly
well
a
feller
told
me
you
was
the
best
housekeeper
in
orham
he
said
that
the
man
that
got
you
would
be
this
was
encouraging
miss
patience
colored
and
simpered
a
little
land
sake
she
exclaimed
whoever
told
you
such
rubbish
as
that
besides
with
downcast
eyes
i
guess
no
man
would
ever
want
oh
i
do
the
captain
moved
uneasily
in
his
chair
as
if
he
contemplated
hitching
it
nearer
to
that
occupied
by
his
companion
i
guess
there
plenty
would
be
mighty
glad
to
git
you
anyhow
there
there
one
that
that
i
the
fog
thick
as
ever
do
you
but
miss
patience
did
mean
to
give
up
in
this
way
what
was
it
you
was
goin
to
say
she
asked
by
way
of
giving
the
bashful
one
another
chance
i
was
goin
to
say
pashy
that
that
i
asked
if
you
thought
the
fog
was
as
thick
as
oh
dear
me
yes
i
likely
is
was
the
discouraged
answer
seems
to
me
i
never
see
such
weather
for
this
time
of
year
the
ice
is
all
out
of
the
bay
and
there
ai
a
bit
of
wind
and
it
warm
as
summer
pretty
nigh
kind
of
a
i
well
i
glad
you
here
to
keep
me
i
never
been
sole
alone
in
this
house
afore
and
i
should
be
dreadful
lonesome
if
you
had
this
was
offered
as
a
fresh
bait
pashy
i
got
somethin
i
wanted
to
ask
you
do
you
think
you
could
er
er
what
perez
i
wanted
to
ask
you
the
captain
swallowed
several
times
to
ask
you
what
in
the
nation
is
that
oh
that
nothin
only
the
hens
squawkin
go
on
yes
but
hens
do
squawk
this
time
of
night
they
have
some
reason
to
it
that
fox
come
back
that
what
is
miss
patience
earlier
in
the
evening
had
related
a
harrowing
tale
of
the
loss
of
two
of
mayo
best
leghorns
that
had
gone
to
furnish
a
sunday
meal
for
a
marauding
fox
as
the
said
leghorns
were
the
pride
of
the
old
lady
heart
even
the
impending
proposal
was
driven
from
miss
davis
mind
oh
perez
you
do
is
the
fox
do
you
yes
i
do
where
the
gun
there
is
behind
the
door
but
there
ai
a
mite
of
shot
in
the
house
abner
been
goin
to
fetch
some
from
the
store
for
i
do
know
how
long
but
he
always
forgot
never
mind
i
pound
the
critter
with
the
butt
come
quick
and
bring
a
the
noise
in
the
henyard
continued
and
when
they
opened
the
door
it
was
louder
than
ever
he
in
the
henhouse
whispered
miss
patience
he
must
have
gone
in
that
hole
at
the
side
that
had
the
loose
board
over
all
right
murmured
the
captain
you
go
with
the
lamp
and
open
the
door
that
scare
him
and
i
stand
at
the
hole
and
thump
him
when
he
comes
so
shielding
the
lamp
with
her
apron
the
guardian
of
outraged
leghorns
tiptoed
around
to
the
henhouse
door
while
captain
perez
brandishing
the
gun
like
a
club
took
up
his
stand
by
the
hole
at
the
side
without
the
lamp
the
darkness
was
pitchy
the
captain
stooping
down
to
watch
saw
something
coming
out
of
the
hole
something
that
was
alive
and
moved
he
swung
the
gun
above
his
head
and
bringing
it
down
with
all
his
might
knocked
into
eternal
oblivion
the
little
life
remaining
in
the
finest
leghorn
rooster
consarn
it
yelled
the
executioner
stooping
and
laying
his
hand
on
the
victim
i
killed
a
hen
just
then
there
came
a
scream
from
the
other
side
of
the
henhouse
followed
by
a
crash
and
the
sound
of
a
fall
running
around
the
corner
the
alarmed
perez
saw
his
stretched
upon
the
ground
groaning
dismally
great
land
of
goshen
he
cried
pashy
are
you
hurt
oh
perez
gasped
the
fallen
one
oh
perez
this
pitiful
appeal
had
such
an
effect
upon
the
captain
that
he
dropped
upon
his
knees
and
raising
miss
davis
head
in
his
hands
begged
her
to
say
she
was
killed
after
some
little
time
she
obligingly
complied
and
then
having
regained
her
breath
explained
the
situation
what
had
happened
was
this
the
fox
having
selected
his
victim
the
rooster
had
rendered
it
helpless
and
was
pushing
it
out
of
the
hole
ahead
of
him
the
captain
had
struck
the
rooster
just
as
miss
patience
opened
the
door
and
the
fox
seizing
this
chance
of
escape
had
dodged
by
the
lady
upsetting
her
as
he
went
well
she
said
laughing
there
no
great
harm
done
i
sorry
for
the
rooster
but
i
guess
the
fox
had
fixed
him
anyway
oh
my
soul
and
body
look
there
perez
turned
looked
as
directed
and
saw
the
henhouse
in
flames
the
lighted
lamp
which
miss
patience
had
dropped
as
she
fell
lay
broken
on
the
floor
and
the
blazing
oil
had
run
in
every
direction
the
flames
were
making
such
headway
that
they
both
saw
there
was
practically
no
chance
of
saving
the
building
the
frightened
hens
were
huddled
in
the
furthest
corner
gazing
stupidly
at
the
fire
oh
those
poor
leghorns
wailed
miss
patience
those
hens
mayo
thought
the
world
of
and
left
me
to
look
out
for
last
thing
she
asked
me
was
to
be
sure
they
was
fed
and
now
they
be
all
burned
up
what
shall
i
do
here
the
lady
began
to
cry
pashy
roared
the
captain
whom
the
sight
of
his
charmer
tears
had
driven
almost
wild
do
say
another
word
i
save
them
hens
or
git
cooked
along
with
and
turning
up
his
coat
collar
as
though
he
was
going
into
a
refrigerator
instead
of
a
burning
building
captain
perez
sprang
through
the
door
miss
davis
screamed
wildly
to
him
to
come
back
and
danced
about
wringing
her
hands
the
interior
of
the
henhouse
was
now
a
mass
of
black
smoke
from
which
the
voices
of
the
captain
and
the
leghorns
floated
in
a
discordant
medley
something
like
this
hold
still
you
lunatics
squawk
druther
be
roasted
than
have
me
catch
you
had
you
squawk
a
kershew
land
i
smothered
now
i
got
you
thunderation
hold
still
hold
still
i
tell
you
just
as
the
agonized
miss
patience
was
on
the
point
of
fainting
the
little
window
at
the
back
of
the
shanty
was
thrown
open
and
two
hens
like
feathered
comets
shot
through
it
then
the
red
face
of
the
captain
appeared
for
an
instant
as
he
caught
his
breath
with
a
woosh
and
dived
back
again
this
performance
was
repeated
six
times
the
language
and
the
compliments
he
paid
the
hens
becoming
more
picturesque
every
moment
at
length
he
announced
that
all
thank
goodness
and
began
to
climb
through
the
window
this
was
a
difficult
task
for
the
window
was
narrow
and
in
spite
of
what
captain
eri
had
called
his
make
up
captain
perez
stuck
fast
catch
hold
of
my
hands
and
haul
will

he
pleaded
it
pull
hard
it
gittin

of
muggy

i
never
complain
at
havin
cold
feet
if

of

now
then
ugh
here

be
he
came
out
with
a
jerk
like
a
cork
out
of
a
bottle
and
rolled
on
the
ground
at
his
lady
feet
oh
perez
she
exclaimed
are
you
hurt
nothin
but
my
feelin
growled
the
rescuer
scrambling
upright
i
read
a
book
once
by
a
feller
named
joshua
billin
or
somethin
like
it
he
was
a
ignorant
chap
could
spell
two
words
right
but
he
had
sense
he
said
a
hen
was
a
darn
fool
and
he
was
right
she
all
the
captain
face
was
blackened
and
his
clothes
were
scorched
but
his
spirit
was
undaunted
pashy
he
said
do
you
realize
that
if
we
do
git
help
this
whole
shebang
house

all

perez

ramshackle
old

dusty
and
cobwebbed
was
dragged
out
of
the
barn
and
horace
greeley
the
horse
was
backed
into
the
shafts
as
they
drove
out
of
the
yard
the
flames
were
roaring
through
the
roof
of
the
henhouse
and
the
lath
fence
surrounding
it
was
beginning
to
blaze
everything
so
wet
from
the
fog
and
the
melted
snow
observed
the
captain
that
it
take
some
time
for
the
fire
to
git
to
the
barn
if
we
can
git
a
gang
here
we
can
save
the
house
easy
and
maybe
more
by
mighty
he
ejaculated
i
tell
you
what
we
do
i
drive
across
the
ford
and
git
luther
and
some
of
the
station
men
to
come
right
across
then
i
go
on
to
the
village
to
fetch
more
it
was
seven
when
i
looked
at
the
clock
as
we
come
in
from
washin
dishes
so
the
tide
must
be
still
goin
out
and
the
ford
jest
right
git
dap
hurry
all
you
can
for
goodness
sake
is
this
as
fast
as
we
can
go
fast
as
we
can
go
with
this
everlastin
noah
ark
heavens
how
them
wheels
squeal
the
axles
ai
been
greased
for
i
do
know
when
abner
was
going
to
have
the
old
carriage
chopped
up
for
kindlin
lucky
for
him
and
us
chopped
up
now
git
dap
better
chop
the
horse
up
too
while
he
the
last
remark
the
captain
made
under
his
breath
my
gracious
how
dark
it
is
think
you
can
find
the
crossin
got
to
find
it
that
all
is
dark
that
a
it
was
they
had
gone
but
a
few
hundred
yards
yet
the
fire
was
already
merely
a
shapeless
red
smudge
on
the
foggy
blackness
behind
them
horace
greeley
pounded
along
at
a
jog
and
when
the
captain
slapped
him
with
the
end
of
the
reins
broke
into
a
jerky
gallop
that
was
slower
than
the
trot
stop
your
hoppin
up
and
down
commanded
perez
whose
temper
was
becoming
somewhat
frayed
you
make
me
think
of
the
walkin
beam
on
a
steamboat
if
you
stop
tryin
to
fly
and
go
straight
ahead
we
do
they
progressed
in
this
fashion
for
some
distance
then
miss
davis
from
the
curtained
depths
of
the
back
seat
spoke
again
oh
dear
me
she
exclaimed
are
you
sure
you
on
the
right
track
seems
if
we
must
be
abreast
the
station
and
this
road
awful
captain
perez
had
remarked
the
roughness
of
the
road
the
carryall
was
pitching
from
one
hummock
to
another
and
horace
greeley
stumbled
once
or
twice
whoa
commanded
the
captain
then
he
got
down
lit
a
match
and
shielding
it
with
his
hands
scrutinized
the
ground
i
kind
of
he
said
presently
that
we
got
off
the
road
somehow
but
we
must
be
opposite
the
crossin
i
goin
to
drive
down
and
see
if
i
can
find
he
turned
the
horse
head
at
right
angles
from
the
way
they
were
going
and
they
pitched
onward
for
another
hundred
yards
then
they
came
out
upon
the
hard
smooth
sand
and
heard
the
water
lapping
on
the
shore
captain
perez
got
out
once
more
and
walked
along
the
strand
bending
forward
as
he
walked
soon
miss
patience
heard
him
calling
i
found
it
i
guess
he
said
coming
back
to
the
vehicle
anyhow
it
looks
like
it
we
be
over
in
a
few
minutes
now
git
dap
you
horace
greeley
shivered
as
the
cold
water
splashed
his
legs
but
waded
bravely
in
they
moved
further
from
the
shore
and
the
water
seemed
to
grow
no
deeper
guess
this
is
the
crossin
all
right
said
the
captain
who
had
cherished
some
secret
doubts
here
the
deep
part
comin
we
be
across
in
a
the
water
mounted
to
the
hubs
then
to
the
bottom
of
the
carryall
miss
davis
feet
grew
damp
and
she
drew
them
up
oh
perez
she
faltered
are
you
sure
this
is
the
ford
do
git
scared
pashy
i
guess
maybe
we
got
a
little
to
one
side
of
the
track
i
turn
and
try
but
horace
greeley
was
of
a
different
mind
from
long
experience
he
knew
that
the
way
to
cross
a
ford
was
to
go
straight
ahead
the
bottom
of
the
carryall
was
awash
port
your
hellum
you
lubber
shouted
the
driver
pulling
with
all
his
might
on
one
rein
heave
to
come
gybe
consarn
you
gybe
then
horace
greeley
tried
to
obey
orders
but
it
was
too
late
he
endeavored
to
touch
bottom
with
his
forelegs
but
could
not
tried
to
swim
with
his
hind
ones
but
found
that
impossible
then
wallowed
wildly
to
one
side
and
snapped
a
shaft
and
the
rotten
whiffletree
short
off
the
carryall
tipped
alarmingly
and
miss
patience
screamed
whoa
yelled
the
agitated
perez
heavin
belay
the
animal
as
much
frightened
by
his
driver
shouts
as
by
the
water
shot
ahead
and
tried
to
tear
himself
loose
the
other
and
rotten
shaft
broke
the
carryall
was
now
floating
with
the
water
covering
the
floor
no
use
i
have
to
cut
away
the
wreck
or
we
be
on
our
beam
ends
shouted
the
captain
he
took
out
his
jackknife
and
reaching
over
severed
the
traces
horace
greeley
gave
another
wallow
and
finding
himself
free
disappeared
in
the
darkness
amid
a
lather
of
foam
the
carriage
now
well
out
in
the
channel
drifted
with
the
current
do
cry
pashy
said
the
captain
endeavoring
to
cheer
his
sobbing
companion
we
ai
shark
bait
yit
as
the
song
used
to
say
afloat
we
afloat
and
the
rover
is
free
i
shipped
aboard
of
every
kind
of
craft
he
added
but
blessed
if
i
ever
expected
to
be
skipper
of
a
carryall
but
miss
patience
shut
up
in
the
back
part
of
the
carriage
like
a
water
nymph
in
her
cave
still
wept
hysterically
so
captain
perez
continued
his
dismal
attempt
at
facetiousness
the
main
thing
he
said
is
to
keep
her
on
an
even
keel
if
she
teeters
to
one
side
you
teeter
to
drat
that
fox
he
ejaculated
i
thought
when
web
place
burned
we
had
fire
enough
to
last
for
one
spell
but
it
never
rains
but
it
oh
dear
sobbed
the
lady
now
everything
burn
up
and
blame
me
for
it
well
i
be
drownded
anyway
so
i
sha
be
there
to
hear
oh
dear
dear
oh
do
talk
that
way
we
driftin
somewheres
but
we
so
i
ca
tell
which
way
judas
he
exclaimed
more
soberly
i
remember
now
it
ai
but
a
little
past
seven
and
the
goin
of
course
it
is
resignedly
and
we
drift
into
the
breakers
in
the
bay
and
that
be
the
no
no
i
guess
not
we
ai
dead
yit
if
i
had
an
oar
or
somethin
to
steer
this
clipper
with
maybe
we
could
git
into
shoal
water
as
is
we
have
to
manage
her
the
way
ote
wixon
used
to
manage
his
wife
by
lettin
her
have
her
own
they
floated
in
silence
for
a
few
moments
then
miss
patience
who
had
bravely
tried
to
stifle
her
sobs
said
with
chattering
teeth
perez
i
pretty
nigh
froze
to
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
captain
had
spoken
of
the
weather
as
being
almost
as
warm
as
summer
this
was
a
slight
exaggeration
it
happened
fortunately
for
the
castaways
that
this
particular
night
coming
as
it
did
just
at
the
end
of
the
long
thaw
was
the
mildest
of
the
winter
and
there
was
no
wind
but
the
air
was
chill
and
the
damp
fog
raw
and
biting
well
now
you
mention
it
said
captain
perez
it
is
cold
ai
it
i
a
good
mind
to
jump
overboard
and
try
to
swim
ashore
and
tow
the
do
you
do
it
my
land
if
you
should
drown
what
would
become
of
me
it
was
the
tone
of
this
speech
as
much
as
the
words
that
hit
the
captain
hard
he
himself
almost
sobbed
as
he
said
pashy
i
want
you
to
try
to
git
over
on
this
front
seat
with
me
then
i
can
put
my
coat
you
and
you
wo
be
so
cold
take
hold
of
my
miss
patience
at
first
protested
that
she
never
could
do
it
in
the
world
the
carriage
would
upset
and
that
would
be
the
end
but
her
companion
urged
her
to
try
and
at
last
she
did
so
it
was
a
risky
proceeding
but
she
reached
the
front
seat
somehow
and
the
carryall
still
remained
luckily
in
the
channel
between
the
beaches
there
was
not
the
slightest
semblance
of
a
wave
captain
perez
pulled
off
his
coat
and
wrapped
it
about
his
protesting
companion
he
was
obliged
to
hold
it
in
place
and
he
found
the
task
rather
pleasing
oh
you
so
good
murmured
miss
patience
what
should
i
have
done
without
you
hush
guess
you
have
been
better
off
you
never
gone
after
that
fox
if
it
had
been
for
me
and
there
would
have
been
none
of
this
oh
do
say
that
you
been
so
brave
anyhow
we
die
together
that
a
pashy
said
captain
perez
solemnly
it
mighty
good
to
hear
you
say
it
is
perhaps
needless
to
explain
that
the
dying
portion
of
the
lady
speech
was
not
that
referred
to
by
the
captain
the
word
together
was
what
appealed
to
him
miss
patience
apparently
understood
is
it
she
said
softly
yes
yes
is
the
arm
holding
the
coat
about
the
lady
shoulder
tightened
just
a
little
the
captain
had
often
dreamed
of
something
like
this
but
never
with
quite
these
surroundings
however
he
was
rapidly
becoming
oblivious
to
such
trivial
details
as
surroundings
pashy
he
said
huskily
i
been
thinkin
of
you
lately
fact
is
i
i
well
i
come
down
to
ask
you
somethin
i
know
it
a
queer
place
to
ask
it
and
and
i
kind
of
sudden
but
will
will
you
breakers
by
mighty
the
carryall
had
suddenly
begun
to
rock
and
there
were
streaks
of
foam
about
it
now
it
gave
a
most
alarming
heave
grounded
swung
clear
and
tipped
yet
more
we
capsizin
yelled
perez
hang
on
to
me
pashy
but
miss
patience
did
intend
to
let
this
perhaps
the
final
opportunity
slip
as
she
told
her
brother
afterward
she
would
have
made
him
say
it
then
if
they
had
been
two
fathom
under
will
i
what
perez
she
demanded
the
carryall
rose
on
two
wheels
and
begun
to
turn
over
but
the
captain
did
not
notice
it
the
arms
of
his
heart
desire
were
about
his
neck
and
he
was
looking
into
her
eyes
will
you
marry
me
he
gasped
yes
answered
miss
patience
and
they
went
under
together
the
captain
staggered
to
his
feet
and
dragged
his
chosen
bride
to
hers
the
water
reached
their
shoulders
and
like
a
flash
as
they
stood
there
came
a
torrent
of
rain
and
a
wind
that
drove
the
fog
before
it
like
smoke
captain
perez
saw
the
shore
with
its
silhouetted
bushes
only
a
few
yards
away
beyond
that
in
the
blackness
was
a
light
a
flickering
blaze
that
rose
and
fell
and
rose
and
fell
again
the
captain
dragged
miss
patience
to
the
beach
run
he
chattered
run
or
we
turn
into
icicles
come
on
with
his
arm
about
her
waist
perez
guided
his
dripping
companion
as
fast
as
they
could
run
toward
the
light
and
as
they
came
nearer
to
it
they
saw
that
it
flickered
about
the
blackened
ruins
of
a
and
a
lath
fence
it
was
mayo
henhouse
and
mayo
fence
their
adventurous
journey
had
ended
where
it
began
you
see
eri
said
captain
perez
as
he
told
his
friend
the
story
that
night
that
clock
in
the
dining
room
that
i
looked
at
had
been
for
a
week
the
mainspring
was
broke
seven
was
nearer
nine
when
the
fire
started
and
the
tide
goin
out
was
comin
in
i
drove
into
the
water
too
soon
missed
the
crossin
and
we
jest
drifted
back
home
the
horse
had
more
sense
than
i
did
we
found
him
in
the
barn
waiting
for
abner
mayo
had
piled
against
the
back
of
his
barn
a
great
heap
of
damp
seaweed
that
he
intended
using
in
the
spring
as
a
fertilizer
the
fire
had
burned
until
it
reached
this
seaweed
and
then
had
gone
no
further
the
rain
extinguished
the
last
spark
well
by
mighty
exclaimed
captain
perez
for
at
least
the
tenth
time
as
he
sat
in
the
kitchen
wrapped
in
an
old
ulster
of
mayo
and
toasting
his
feet
in
the
oven
if
i
do
feel
like
a
fool
all
that
scare
and
wet
for
oh
not
for
nothin
perez
said
miss
patience
looking
tenderly
down
into
his
face
well
no
not
for
nothin
by
a
good
deal
i
got
you
by
it
and
that
everything
but
say
pashy
and
the
captain
looked
awed
by
the
coincidence
i
went
through
fire
and
water
to
git
you
chapter
xviii
the
sins
of
captain
jerry
captain
perez
made
a
clean
breast
of
it
to
captain
eri
when
he
reached
home
that
night
it
was
after
twelve
but
he
routed
his
friend
out
of
bed
to
tell
him
the
news
and
the
story
captain
eri
was
not
as
surprised
to
hear
of
the
engagement
as
he
pretended
to
be
for
he
had
long
ago
made
up
his
mind
that
perez
meant
business
this
time
but
the
tale
of
the
fire
and
the
voyage
in
the
carryall
tickled
him
immensely
and
he
rolled
back
and
forth
in
the
rocker
and
laughed
until
his
side
ached
i
it
does
sound
kind
of
said
the
accepted
suitor
in
a
rather
aggrieved
tone
but
it
so
funny
when
was
on
fust
i
thought
i
roast
to
death
then
i
thought
i
freeze
and
then
i
thought
i
perez
said
the
panting
eri
you
a
wonder
i
goin
to
tell
sol
bangs
you
next
time
i
see
him
he
want
you
to
enter
in
the
races
next
fourth
of
july
we
had
tub
races
and
the
like
of
that
but
a
carryall
sailin
match
be
somethin
new
i
back
you
against
the
town
though
you
can
count
on
now
look
here
eri
hedge
if
you
tell
a
livin
soul
it
i
all
right
shipmate
all
right
but
it
too
good
to
keep
you
ought
to
write
a
book
one
of
them
kind
like
josiah
used
to
read
call
it
carryall
pirate
or
the
terror
of
the
channel
hey
gee
you
be
famous
but
say
old
man
he
added
more
seriously
i
shake
hands
with
you
i
you
got
a
good
woman
one
that
make
it
smooth
sailin
for
you
the
rest
of
your
life
i
wish
you
both
captain
perez
shook
hands
very
gravely
he
was
still
a
little
suspicious
of
his
chum
propensity
to
tease
it
did
not
tend
to
make
him
less
uneasy
when
a
little
later
captain
eri
opened
the
parlor
door
and
whispered
say
perez
i
jest
thought
of
what
are
you
goin
to
say
to
busteed
her
heart
be
aw
git
out
was
the
disgusted
answer
well
i
only
mentioned
it
folks
have
had
to
pay
heavy
for
breach
of
promise
now
perez
manfully
told
of
his
engagement
at
the
breakfast
table
next
morning
although
he
said
nothing
concerning
the
rest
of
his
adventures
he
was
rather
taken
aback
to
find
that
no
one
seemed
greatly
surprised
everyone
congratulated
him
of
course
and
it
was
gratifying
to
discern
the
high
opinion
of
the
future
ryder
held
by
mrs
snow
and
the
rest
captain
jerry
solemnly
shook
hands
with
him
after
the
meal
was
over
and
said
perez
you
done
the
right
thing
there
nothin
like
married
life
after
then
why
do
you
try
it
yourself
was
the
unexpected
question
seems
to
me
we
have
to
settle
that
matter
of
yours
pretty
soon
i
meant
to
speak
to
eri
it
this
but
i
had
so
much
on
my
mind
i
will
when
he
comes
back
from
captain
jerry
made
no
further
remarks
but
walked
thoughtfully
away
so
that
evening
when
they
were
together
in
captain
jerry
room
after
supper
perez
true
to
his
promise
said
eri
it
seems
to
me
we
got
to
do
somethin
mrs
snow
she
was
hired
to
be
housekeeper
while
john
was
sick
now
he
dead
and
think
it
queer
if
we
do
settle
that
marryin
ai
that
so

in
the
fust
place
was
jest
a
wife
for
one
of
us
that
would
keep
things
shipshape
and
now
the
withering
look
of
scorn
that
perez
bent
upon
him
caused
him
to
hesitate
and
stop
captain
perez
haughtily
marched
to
the
door
eri
he
said
i
ai
goin
to
waste
my
time
talkin
to

a
dogfish

of
mrs
snow
only
that
i
ai
got
the
spunk
to
ask
her
that
humph
it
do
take
much
spunk
replied
the
successful
wooer
forgetful
of
his
own
past
trepidation
well
captain
jerry
wriggled
and
twisted
but
saw
no
loophole
well
give
me
a
month
to
git
up
my
courage
in
and
a
month
a
month
ai
it
eri
well
three
weeks
this
offer
too
was
rejected
then
captain
jerry
held
out
for
a
fortnight
for
ten
days
finally
it
was
settled
that
within
one
week
from
that
very
night
he
was
to
offer
his
heart
and
hand
to
the
lady
from
nantucket
he
pledged
his
solemn
word
to
do
it
there
exclaimed
the
gratified
captain
perez
that
a
good
job
done
he
wo
never
be
sorry
for
it
will
he
eri
and
captain
eri
made
his
fourth
contribution
to
the
conversation
no
he
said
josiah
went
up
to
the
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
the
able
seaman
was
behaving
himself
remarkably
well
he
had
become
a
real
help
to
captain
eri
and
the
latter
said
that
sailing
alone
would
be
doubly
hard
when
his
foremast
hand
went
back
to
school
again
which
he
was
to
do
very
shortly
for
josiah
meant
to
accept
the
offer
and
to
try
for
the
annapolis
appointment
when
the
time
came
the
boy
came
back
with
the
mail
and
an
item
of
news
the
mail
a
paper
only
he
handed
to
mrs
snow
and
the
news
he
announced
at
the
supper
table
as
follows
mr
hazeltine
goin
to
leave
the
cable
station
he
said
goin
to
leave
repeated
the
housekeeper
what
for
i
do
know
all
i
know
is
what
i
heard
wingate
say
he
said
hazeltine
was
goin
to
get
through
over
at
the
station
pretty
soon
he
said
one
of
the
operators
told
him
well
for
the
land
sake
did
you
know
anything
it
eri
why
yes
a
little
i
met
hazeltine
yesterday
and
he
told
me
that
some
folks
out
west
had
made
him
a
pretty
good
offer
and
he
did
know
whether
to
take
it
or
not
said
the
salary
was
good
and
the
whole
thing
looked
sort
of
temptin
he
had
decided
what
to
do
yit
that
all
there
is
to
there
was
little
else
talked
about
during
the
meal
captain
perez
captain
jerry
and
mrs
snow
argued
surmised
and
questioned
captain
eri
who
said
little
elsie
said
almost
nothing
and
went
to
her
room
shortly
after
the
dishes
were
washed
humph
exclaimed
captain
perez
when
they
were
alone
i
guess
your
scheme
up
spout
and
for
a
wonder
captain
jerry
did
not
contradict
him
the
weather
changed
that
night
and
it
grew
cold
rapidly
in
the
morning
the
pump
was
frozen
and
captain
jerry
and
mrs
snow
spent
some
time
and
much
energy
in
thawing
it
out
it
was
later
than
usual
when
the
former
set
out
for
the
schoolhouse
as
he
was
putting
on
his
cap
elsie
suggested
that
he
wait
for
her
as
she
had
some
lessons
to
prepare
and
wanted
an
hour
or
so
to
herself
at
her
desk
so
they
walked
on
together
under
a
cloudy
sky
the
mud
in
the
road
was
frozen
into
all
sorts
of
fantastic
shapes
and
the
little
puddles
had
turned
to
ice
that
thaw
was
a
sure
enough
observed
captain
jerry
we
git
a
storm
out
of
this
we
it
seems
to
me
said
elsie
that
the
winter
has
been
a
very
mild
one
from
what
i
had
heard
i
supposed
you
must
have
some
dreadful
gales
here
but
there
has
been
none
so
we
git
yit
february
jist
the
time
git
a
good
goin
and
you
think
the
whole
house
is
comin
down
nothin
to
what
they
used
to
have
though
to
tell
jonadab
wixon
used
to
swear
that
his
grandfather
told
him
a
gale
that
blew
the
hair
all
off
a
dog
and
then
the
wind
changed
of
a
sudden
and
blew
it
all
on
elsie
laughed
that
must
have
been
a
blow
she
said
yes
jonadab
somethin
of
a
blow
himself
so
he
ought
to
be
a
good
jedge
the
outer
beach
is
the
place
that
catches
it
when
a
gale
on
oh
say
that
reminds
me
i
you
was
glad
to
hear
the
news
last
night
what
news
why
that
hazeltine
goin
away
you
glad
he
goin
of
miss
preston
did
not
answer
immediately
instead
she
turned
and
looked
wonderingly
at
her
companion
why
should
i
be
glad
pray
she
asked
why
i
do
know
i
jest
took
it
for
granted
you
would
be
you
want
him
to
come
and
see
you
and
if
he
was
gone
he
could
come
so
just
a
minute
please
what
makes
you
think
i
did
want
hazeltine
to
call
and
now
it
was
the
captain
turn
to
stare
and
hesitate
what
makes
me
think
he
gasped
why
you
told
me
so
told
you
so
i
certain
that
i
never
told
you
anything
of
the
captain
jerry
stood
and
if
ever
a
face
expressed
complete
amazement
it
was
his
elsie
preston
he
ejaculated
are
you
losin
your
or
what
did
you
pitch
into
me
for
lettin
him
be
alone
with
you
did
you
give
me
from
the
tomb
for
gittin
up
and
goin
away
did
you
say
his
calls
was
perfect
torture
to
you
and
that
you
had
to
be
decent
to
him
jest
out
of
common
politeness
now
did
you
oh
that
was
it
no
of
course
i
did
say
any
such
you
did
why
i
heard
you
land
of
love
my
ears
smarted
for
a
week
afterward
i
ai
had
sech
a
goin
over
sence
mother
used
to
git
at
me
for
goin
in
swimmin
on
sunday
and
now
you
say
you
did
say
i
did
you
misunderstood
me
i
did
object
to
your
leaving
the
room
every
time
he
called
and
making
me
appear
so
ridiculous
and
i
did
say
that
his
visits
might
be
a
torture
for
all
that
you
knew
to
the
contrary
but
i
certainly
did
say
that
they
sufferin
and
you
ai
glad
he
stopped
comin
the
air
of
complete
indifference
assumed
by
the
young
lady
was
a
triumph
why
of
course
she
said
mr
hazeltine
is
a
free
agent
and
i
know
of
any
reason
why
he
should
be
compelled
to
go
where
he
wish
to
go
i
enjoyed
his
society
and
i
sure
captain
eri
and
mrs
snow
enjoyed
it
too
but
it
is
quite
evident
that
he
did
not
enjoy
ours
so
i
do
see
that
there
need
be
any
more
said
on
the
captain
jerry
was
completely
crushed
if
the
gale
described
by
the
redoubtable
grandsire
of
jonadab
wixon
had
struck
him
he
could
not
have
been
more
upset
my
my
my
he
murmured
and
after
my
beggin
his
pardon
and
all
begging
his
pardon
for
what
why
for
leavin
you
two
alone
of
course
after
you
pitched
into
me
so
i
see
how
foolish
i
been
actin
and
i
honest
i
did
sleep
scursely
a
bit
that
night
thinkin
it
thinks
i
elsie
feels
that
way
why
there
ai
no
doubt
that
hazeltine
feels
the
same
there
but
one
thing
to
be
done
when
a
man
makes
a
mistake
if
he
is
any
kind
of
a
man
he
owns
up
and
does
his
best
to
straighten
things
out
easy
to
do
but
duty
duty
and
the
next
time
i
see
hazeltine
i
told
him
the
whole
thing
and
you
did
sartin
i
what
did
you
tell
him
they
had
stopped
on
the
sidewalk
nearly
opposite
the
each
was
too
much
engrossed
in
the
conversation
to
pay
any
heed
to
anything
else
if
the
few
passersby
thought
it
strange
that
the
schoolmistress
should
care
to
loiter
out
of
doors
on
that
cold
and
disagreeable
morning
they
said
nothing
about
it
one
young
man
in
particular
who
standing
just
inside
the
door
was
buttoning
his
overcoat
and
putting
on
his
gloves
looked
earnestly
at
the
pair
but
he
too
said
nothing
why
i
told
him
said
captain
jerry
in
reply
to
the
question
how
you
did
like
to
have
me
go
out
of
the
room
when
he
was
there
course
i
told
him
i
did
mean
to
do
nothin
out
of
the
way
then
he
asked
me
some
more
questions
and
i
answered
best
i
could
and
well
i
guess
that
did
you
tell
him
that
i
said
his
visits
were
a
torture
why
the
captain
shuffled
his
feet
uneasily
seems
to
me
i
said
somethin
it
not
jest
that
you
know
but
somethin
fact
is
i
was
so
and
upset
that
i
do
know
exactly
what
i
did
say
anyhow
he
said
was
all
right
so
there
ai
nothin
to
worry
captain
jeremiah
burgess
exclaimed
elsie
then
she
added
what
must
he
think
of
me
oh
i
fix
that
exclaimed
the
captain
i
see
him
some
time
and
i
tell
him
you
did
mean
it
why
i
declare
yes
is
there
he
is
now
hi
hazeltine
come
here
a
a
mischievous
imp
was
certainly
directing
captain
jerry
movements
ralph
had
almost
for
the
first
time
since
he
came
to
orham
paid
an
early
morning
visit
to
the
office
in
order
to
send
an
important
letter
in
the
first
mail
the
slamming
of
the
door
had
attracted
the
attention
and
in
response
to
the
hail
hazeltine
crossed
the
road
and
then
captain
jerry
felt
his
arm
clutched
with
a
grip
that
meant
business
as
miss
preston
whispered
do
you
dare
say
one
word
to
him
about
it
do
you
dare
if
ralph
had
been
surprised
by
the
request
to
join
the
couple
he
was
more
surprised
by
the
reception
he
received
elsie
face
was
crimson
and
as
for
the
captain
he
looked
like
a
man
who
had
suddenly
been
left
standing
alone
in
the
middle
of
a
pond
covered
with
very
thin
ice
the
electrician
bowed
and
shook
hands
gravely
as
no
remark
seemed
to
be
forthcoming
from
those
who
had
summoned
him
he
observed
that
it
was
an
unpleasant
morning
this
commonplace
reminded
him
of
one
somewhat
similar
that
he
had
made
to
a
supposed
miss
gusty
black
and
he
too
colored
did
you
want
to
speak
with
me
captain
he
asked
to
cover
his
confusion
why
why
i
did
stammered
poor
captain
jerry
but
but
i
do
know
i
do
then
he
realized
that
this
was
not
exactly
complimentary
and
added
that
is
i
do
know
i
do
i
elsie
what
was
it
i
was
goin
to
say
to
hazeltine
at
another
time
it
is
likely
that
the
young
lady
quick
wit
would
have
helped
her
out
of
the
difficulty
but
now
she
was
too
much
disturbed
i
sure
i
do
know
she
said
coldly
you
do
know
why
yes
you
do
was
was
the
captain
was
frantically
grasping
at
straws
why
we
was
wonderin
why
you
come
to
see
us
if
the
captain
had
seen
the
look
that
elsie
shot
at
him
as
he
delivered
this
brilliant
observation
he
might
have
been
more
instead
of
less
uncomfortable
as
it
was
he
felt
rather
proud
of
having
discovered
a
way
out
of
the
difficulty
but
ralph
embarrassment
increased
he
hurriedly
said
something
about
having
been
very
busy
well
went
on
the
captain
intent
on
making
the
explanation
as
plausible
as
possible
we
missed
you
we
was
sayin
we
hoped
you
would
give
us
up
altogether
ai
that
so
elsie
miss
preston
foot
tapped
the
sidewalk
several
times
but
she
answered
though
not
effusively
mr
hazeltine
is
always
welcome
of
then
she
added
turning
away
really
captain
jerry
i
must
hurry
to
school
i
have
a
great
deal
of
work
to
do
before
nine
the
captain
paused
long
enough
to
say
we
expect
you
now
so
come
and
then
hurried
after
her
he
was
feeling
very
well
satisfied
with
himself
by
mighty
elsie
he
chuckled
i
got
out
of
that
nice
did
i
he
received
no
answer
even
when
he
repeated
the
remark
and
although
he
endeavored
as
he
swept
out
the
schoolroom
to
engage
the
teacher
in
conversation
her
replies
were
as
cold
as
they
were
short
the
captain
went
home
in
the
last
stages
of
dismalness
that
afternoon
when
captain
eri
returned
from
the
fishing
grounds
he
found
captain
jerry
waiting
for
him
at
the
shanty
the
humiliated
matchmaker
sent
josiah
up
to
the
grocery
store
on
an
errand
and
then
dragged
his
friend
inside
and
shut
the
door
captain
eri
looked
at
the
face
with
some
concern
what
ails
you
jerry
he
demanded
have
you
have
you
spoken
to
mrs
snow
that
that
marriage
no
i
ai
eri
but
i
in
a
turrible
mess
and
i
do
know
why
neither
seems
to
me
the
more
i
try
to
do
for
other
folks
the
wuss
off
i
am
and
instead
of
gittin
thanks
all
i
git
is
why
what
the
matter
well
now
i
know
you
think
i
a
fool
and
jest
pester
the
life
out
of
me
see
here
eri
hedge
if
i
tell
you
what
i
want
to
will
you
promise
not
to
pitch
into
me
and
not
to
nag
and
poke
fun
if
you
promise
i
wo
tell
one
single
word
no
matter
what
so
captain
eri
promised
and
then
captain
jerry
stammering
and
hesitating
unburdened
his
mind
of
the
whole
affair
telling
of
his
first
reproof
by
elsie
his
explanation
to
ralph
and
the
subsequent
developments
long
before
he
finished
captain
eri
rose
and
walking
over
to
the
door
stood
looking
out
through
the
dim
pane
at
the
top
while
his
shoulders
shook
as
if
there
was
a
smothered
earthquake
inside
there
exclaimed
the
injured
matrimonial
agent
in
conclusion
there
the
whole
fool
thing
and
i
wish
i
never
seen
either
of
i
thought
i
did
this
mornin
when
i
was
tryin
to
think
up
somethin
to
show
why
i
hailed
hazeltine
but
no
elsie
wo
hardly
speak
to
me
i
wish
to
goodness
you
tell
me
what
to
captain
eri
turned
away
from
the
door
his
eyes
were
watery
and
his
face
was
red
but
he
managed
to
say
oh
jerry
jerry
your
heart
big
as
a
bucket
but
fishin
more
in
your
line
than
gittin
folks
married
to
order
is
i
you
stay
here
and
unload
them
fish
in
the
dory
there
ai
many
of
and
josiah
help
when
he
gits
back
i
goin
out
for
a
few
he
went
down
to
the
beach
climbed
into
a
dory
belonging
to
a
neighbor
and
captain
jerry
saw
him
row
away
in
the
direction
of
the
cable
station
that
evening
after
the
dishes
were
washed
and
the
table
cleared
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
mrs
snow
opened
it
why
for
goodness
sake
hazeltine
she
exclaimed
come
right
in
what
a
stranger
you
are
ralph
entered
shook
the
snow
which
had
just
begun
to
fall
from
his
hat
and
coat
took
off
these
articles
in
response
to
the
hearty
invitation
of
captain
eri
and
shook
hands
with
all
present
face
was
an
interesting
study
captain
jerry
looked
scared
after
a
few
minutes
talk
captain
eri
rose
mrs
snow
he
said
come
upstairs
a
little
while
i
want
to
talk
to
you
somethin
you
come
too
captain
jerry
looked
from
elsie
to
the
speaker
and
then
to
elsie
again
but
captain
eri
hand
was
on
his
arm
and
he
rose
and
went
elsie
watched
this
wholesale
desertion
with
amazement
then
the
door
opened
again
and
captain
eri
put
in
his
head
elsie
he
said
i
jest
want
to
tell
you
that
this
is
my
doin
not
jerry
that
and
the
door
shut
elsie
faced
the
caller
with
astonishment
written
on
her
face
mr
hazeltine
she
said
icily
you
may
know
what
this
means
but
i
ralph
looked
at
her
and
answered
solemnly
but
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
i
afraid
i
can
guess
miss
preston
you
see
captain
jerry
paid
captain
eri
a
call
this
afternoon
and
as
a
result
captain
eri
called
upon
me
then
as
a
result
of
that
i
well
i
came
the
young
lady
blushed
furiously
what
did
captain
eri
tell
you
she
demanded
just
what
captain
jerry
told
and
that
was
what
you
told
captain
jerry
this
morning
concerning
something
that
you
told
him
before
i
there
was
no
answer
to
this
miss
preston
looked
as
if
she
had
a
mind
to
run
out
of
the
room
then
as
if
she
might
cry
and
finally
as
if
she
wanted
to
laugh
i
humbly
apologize
said
the
electrician
contritely
you
apologize
for
what
for
my
stupidity
in
believing
that
captain
jerry
was
to
be
accepted
you
were
excusable
certainly
and
now
i
must
apologize
also
for
taking
the
captain
too
suppose
we
pair
the
apologies
as
they
do
the
votes
in
the
senate
then
one
will
offset
the
i
afraid
that
is
fair
for
the
blunder
was
all
on
my
well
if
we
ca
pair
apologies
suppose
we
pair
blunders
i
accept
your
statement
of
guilt
mind
but
since
you
are
determined
to
shoulder
it
we
might
put
it
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
we
put
what
and
then
they
both
laughed
a
little
later
captain
eri
knocked
at
the
door
is
it
safe
for
a
feller
to
come
in
he
asked
well
said
elsie
severely
i
do
know
whether
talebearers
should
be
admitted
or
not
but
if
they
do
come
they
must
beg
pardon
for
interfering
in
other
people
and
the
captain
made
a
profound
bow
i
hope
you
be
so
and
condescendin
and
stoop
so
low
and
be
so
bendin
as
to
forgive
me
and
while
i
it
i
apologize
for
jerry
no
sir
said
the
young
lady
decidedly
captain
jerry
must
apologize
for
himself
captain
jeremiah
burgess
she
called
up
the
stairway
come
into
court
and
answer
for
your
and
captain
jerry
tremblingly
came
chapter
xix
a
blows
it
had
begun
to
snow
early
in
the
evening
a
light
fall
at
first
but
growing
heavier
every
minute
and
as
the
flakes
fell
thicker
and
faster
the
wind
began
to
blow
and
its
force
increased
steadily
ralph
hearing
the
gusts
as
they
swooped
about
the
corners
of
the
house
and
the
swish
of
the
snow
as
it
was
thrown
against
the
window
panes
several
times
rose
to
go
but
captain
eri
in
each
instance
urged
him
to
stay
a
little
longer
finally
the
electrician
rebelled
i
should
like
to
stay
captain
he
said
but
how
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
get
over
to
the
station
if
this
storm
grows
worse
as
it
seems
to
be
doing
i
do
think
was
the
calm
reply
you
goin
to
stay
well
i
guess
i
guess
yes
we
goin
to
let
you
try
to
row
over
to
the
beach
a
night
like
this
it
darker
a
nigger
pocket
and
blowin
and
snowin
great
guns
besides
jest
you
look
out
he
rose
beckoned
to
ralph
and
then
opened
the
outer
door
he
had
to
use
considerable
strength
to
do
this
and
a
gust
of
wind
and
a
small
avalanche
of
snow
roared
in
and
sent
the
lighter
articles
flying
from
the
table
elsie
gave
a
little
scream
and
mrs
snow
exclaimed
for
the
land
sake
shut
that
door
this
minute
everything
be
soppin
the
captain
pulled
the
door
shut
again
and
dropped
the
hook
into
the
staple
nice
night
for
a
pull
ai
it
he
observed
smiling
no
sir
heard
it
comin
on
and
i
made
up
my
mind
you
have
to
stay
on
dry
land
for
a
spell
no
matter
if
all
creation
wanted
you
on
ralph
looked
troubled
i
ought
to
be
at
the
station
he
said
maybe
so
but
you
ai
and
you
have
to
put
up
at
this
house
till
mornin
when
it
daylight
one
of
us
set
you
across
langley
ai
foolish
he
wo
expect
you
now
hazeltine
said
the
housekeeper
you
might
jest
as
well
give
it
up
fust
as
last
you
know
you
ca
go
over
to
that
station
jest
as
well
as
i
so
ralph
did
give
it
up
although
rather
against
his
will
there
was
nothing
of
importance
to
be
done
but
he
felt
a
little
like
a
deserter
nevertheless
perez
wo
git
home
neither
observed
captain
eri
he
snowed
in
captain
perez
had
that
afternoon
gone
down
to
the
mayo
homestead
to
take
tea
with
miss
davis
git
home
i
should
think
not
said
mrs
snow
decidedly
pashy
got
too
much
sense
to
let
him
try
well
elsie
commented
captain
jerry
i
told
you
we
have
a
the
winter
was
over
i
guess
there
be
gale
enough
to
satisfy
you
now
no
school
well
that
settled
let
be
ai
there
some
of
that
cider
down
cellar
where
the
pitcher
and
captain
eri
hurried
off
to
find
it
when
bedtime
came
there
was
some
argument
as
to
where
the
guest
should
sleep
ralph
insisted
that
the
haircloth
sofa
in
the
parlor
was
just
the
thing
but
captain
eri
would
hear
of
it
haircloth
all
right
to
look
at
he
said
but
it
the
slipperiest
stuff
that
ever
was
i
every
time
i
set
on
a
haircloth
chair
i
feel
if
i
was
draggin
the
cot
was
declared
ineligible
also
and
the
question
was
finally
settled
by
josiah
and
captain
eri
going
upstairs
to
the
room
once
occupied
by
john
baxter
while
ralph
took
that
which
they
vacated
it
was
some
time
before
he
fell
asleep
the
gale
seemed
to
be
tearing
loose
the
eternal
foundations
the
house
shook
and
the
bed
trembled
as
if
a
great
hand
was
moving
them
and
the
snow
slapped
against
the
windows
till
it
seemed
that
they
must
break
in
the
morning
there
was
little
change
in
the
weather
the
snow
had
turned
to
a
sleet
half
rain
that
stuck
to
everything
and
coated
it
with
ice
the
wind
was
blowing
as
hard
as
ever
captain
eri
and
ralph
standing
just
outside
the
kitchen
door
and
in
the
lee
of
the
barn
paused
to
watch
the
storm
for
a
minute
before
they
went
down
to
the
beach
at
intervals
they
caught
glimpses
of
the
roofs
of
the
fish
shanties
and
the
water
of
the
inner
bay
black
and
threatening
and
scarred
with
whitecaps
then
another
gust
would
come
and
they
could
scarcely
see
the
posts
at
the
yard
gate
think
you
want
to
go
over
do
you
asked
the
captain
i
certainly
do
if
i
can
get
oh
we
can
git
there
all
right
i
rowed
a
dory
a
good
many
times
when
was
as
bad
as
this
this
ai
no
picnic
day
though
that
a
fact
he
added
as
they
crossed
the
yard
and
caught
the
full
force
of
the
wind
lucky
you
put
on
them
ralph
was
arrayed
in
captain
jerry
rig
and
although
as
captain
eri
said
the
garments
fitted
him
like
a
shirt
on
a
handspike
they
were
very
acceptable
they
found
the
dory
covered
with
snow
and
of
slush
and
it
took
some
few
minutes
to
get
her
into
condition
when
this
was
accomplished
they
hauled
her
down
to
the
shore
and
captain
eri
standing
in
water
steadied
her
while
ralph
climbed
in
then
the
captain
tumbled
in
himself
picked
up
the
oars
and
settled
down
for
the
pull
to
the
outer
beach
a
dory
as
everyone
acquainted
alongshore
knows
is
the
safest
of
all
small
craft
for
use
in
heavy
weather
it
is
unsinkable
for
one
thing
and
being
slips
over
the
waves
instead
of
plowing
through
them
but
the
high
freeboard
is
a
mark
for
the
wind
and
to
keep
a
straight
course
on
such
a
morning
as
this
requires
skill
and
no
small
amount
of
muscle
ralph
seated
in
the
stern
found
himself
wondering
how
on
earth
his
companion
managed
to
row
as
he
did
and
steer
at
the
same
time
the
strokes
were
short
but
there
was
power
in
them
and
the
dory
although
moving
rather
slowly
went
doggedly
on
let
me
take
her
shouted
ralph
after
a
while
you
must
be
who
me
captain
eri
laughed
i
could
keep
this
up
for
a
week
there
ai
any
sea
in
here
if
we
was
outside
now
be
they
hit
the
beach
almost
exactly
at
the
right
spot
a
feat
which
the
passenger
considered
a
miracle
but
which
the
captain
seemed
to
take
as
a
matter
of
course
they
beached
and
anchored
the
dory
and
bending
almost
double
as
they
faced
the
wind
plowed
through
the
sand
to
the
back
door
of
the
station
there
was
comparatively
little
snow
here
on
the
outer
beach
the
gale
had
swept
it
nearly
all
away
langley
met
them
as
they
tramped
into
the
hall
the
old
gentleman
was
glad
to
see
his
assistant
for
he
had
begun
to
fear
that
the
latter
might
have
tried
to
row
over
during
the
evening
and
met
with
disaster
as
they
sat
round
the
stove
in
his
room
he
said
we
do
need
any
wrecks
inside
the
beach
we
shall
have
enough
outside
i
afraid
i
hear
there
is
one
schooner
in
trouble
that
so
asked
captain
eri
where
is
she
on
the
hog
back
shoal
they
think
one
of
the
crew
told
mclaughlin
that
they
saw
her
last
night
when
the
gale
first
began
trying
to
make
an
offing
and
that
wreckage
was
coming
ashore
this
morning
captain
davis
was
going
to
try
to
reach
her
with
the
boat
i
i
should
like
to
be
at
the
station
when
they
land
said
ralph
it
would
be
a
new
experience
for
me
i
seen
the
crew
drill
often
enough
but
i
have
never
seen
them
actually
at
what
say
if
we
go
down
to
the
station
asked
the
captain
that
is
if
langley
here
can
spare
oh
i
can
spare
him
said
the
superintendent
there
is
nothing
of
importance
to
be
done
here
just
now
but
it
will
be
a
terrible
walk
down
the
beach
this
wind
be
at
our
backs
and
we
rigged
for
it
too
what
say
hazeltine
ralph
was
only
too
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
see
at
least
the
finish
of
a
rescuing
expedition
and
he
said
so
so
they
got
into
the
oilskins
again
pulled
their
down
over
their
ears
and
started
on
the
tramp
to
the
station
the
electrician
is
not
likely
to
forget
that
walk
the
wind
was
as
the
captain
said
at
their
backs
but
it
whistled
in
from
the
sea
with
terrific
strength
and
carried
the
sleet
with
it
it
deluged
them
with
water
and
plastered
them
with
flying
seaweed
and
ice
the
wet
sand
came
in
showers
like
hail
and
beat
against
their
shoulders
until
they
felt
the
sting
even
through
their
clothes
toward
the
bay
was
nothing
but
gray
mist
streaked
with
rain
and
sleet
toward
the
sea
was
the
same
mist
flying
with
the
wind
over
such
a
huddle
of
tossing
green
and
white
as
ralph
had
never
seen
the
surf
poured
in
in
rollers
that
leaped
over
each
other
humped
backs
in
their
savage
energy
to
get
at
the
shore
which
trembled
as
they
beat
upon
it
the
ripples
from
one
wave
had
not
time
to
flow
back
before
those
of
the
next
came
threshing
in
great
blobs
of
foam
shot
down
the
strand
like
wild
birds
and
the
gurgle
and
splash
and
roar
were
terrific
they
walked
as
near
the
water
line
as
they
dared
because
the
sand
was
harder
there
captain
eri
went
ahead
hands
in
his
pockets
and
head
down
ralph
followed
sometimes
watching
his
companion
but
oftener
gazing
at
the
sea
at
intervals
there
would
be
a
lull
as
if
the
storm
giant
had
paused
for
breath
and
they
could
see
for
half
a
mile
over
the
crazy
water
then
the
next
gust
would
pull
the
curtain
down
again
and
a
whirl
of
rain
and
sleet
would
shut
them
in
conversation
meant
only
a
series
of
shrieks
and
they
gave
it
up
at
length
the
captain
turned
grinned
pleasantly
while
the
rain
drops
splashed
on
his
nose
and
waved
one
arm
ralph
looked
and
saw
ahead
of
them
the
clustered
buildings
of
the
station
and
he
was
glad
to
see
them
whew
puffed
captain
eri
as
they
opened
the
door
nice
mornin
for
ducks
hey
luther
he
shouted
wake
up
here
you
got
they
heard
footsteps
in
the
next
room
the
door
opened
and
in
came
not
luther
davis
but
captain
perez
why
eri
he
exclaimed
amazedly
for
the
land
sake
perez
what
are
you
doin
here
what
are
you
doin
here
i
should
say
how
do
hazeltine
captain
eri
pushed
back
his
and
strolled
over
to
the
stove
ralph
followed
suit
well
perez
said
the
former
extending
his
hands
over
the
fire
easy
enough
to
tell
you
why
we
here
we
heard
there
was
a
there
is
she
a
schooner
and
she
off
there
on
the
hog
back
luther
and
the
crew
put
off
to
her
more
two
hours
ago
and
gittin
then
perez
went
on
to
explain
that
because
of
the
storm
he
had
been
persuaded
to
stay
at
mayo
all
night
that
captain
davis
had
been
over
for
a
moment
that
evening
on
an
errand
and
had
said
that
the
schooner
had
been
sighted
and
that
as
the
northeaster
was
coming
on
she
was
almost
certain
to
get
into
trouble
that
he
perez
had
rowed
over
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
to
get
the
news
and
had
been
just
in
time
to
see
the
launching
of
the
lifeboat
as
the
crew
put
off
to
the
schooner
there
ai
nothin
to
worry
observed
captain
eri
it
no
slouch
of
a
pull
off
to
the
hog
back
this
weather
and
besides
trust
lute
davis
anywhere
on
salt
yes
i
know
replied
the
unconvinced
captain
perez
but
he
ought
to
have
been
back
afore
this
there
was
a
kind
of
in
the
storm
jest
afore
i
got
here
and
they
see
her
fast
on
the
shoal
with
the
crew
in
the
riggin
luther
took
the
small
boat
he
thought
he
could
handle
her
better
and
that
what
worryin
me
i
overloaded
i
was
jest
thinkin
of
goin
out
on
the
to
see
if
i
could
see
anything
of
when
you
folks
well
go
ahead
we
go
with
you
if
hazeltine
got
any
of
the
chill
out
of
ralph
was
feeling
warm
by
this
time
and
after
perez
had
put
on
his
coat
and
hat
they
went
out
once
more
into
the
gale
the
point
of
which
perez
had
spoken
was
a
sand
ridge
that
thrown
up
by
the
waves
and
tide
thrust
itself
out
from
the
beach
some
few
hundred
yards
below
the
station
they
reached
its
tip
and
stood
there
in
the
very
midst
of
the
storm
waiting
for
the
lulls
now
more
frequent
and
scanning
the
tumbling
water
for
the
returning
lifeboat
schooner
layin
right
over
there
shouted
captain
perez
in
ear
pointing
off
into
the
mist
a
mile
off
shore
i
wicked
place
the
hog
back
is
wind
lettin
up
a
little
mite
bellowed
captain
eri
we
had
the
wust
of
it
i
guess
there
ai
so
much
he
did
not
finish
the
sentence
the
curtain
of
sleet
parted
leaving
a
lane
through
which
they
could
see
the
frothing
ridges
racing
one
after
the
other
endlessly
and
across
this
lane
silent
and
swift
like
a
moving
picture
on
a
screen
drifted
a
white
turtleback
with
black
dots
clinging
to
it
it
was
in
sight
not
more
than
a
half
minute
then
the
lane
closed
again
as
the
rain
lashed
their
faces
captain
perez
gasped
and
clutched
the
electrician
by
the
arm
godfrey
mighty
he
exclaimed
what
was
it
shouted
ralph
what
was
it
captain
eri
but
captain
eri
did
not
answer
he
had
turned
and
was
running
at
full
speed
back
to
the
beach
when
they
came
up
they
found
him
straining
at
the
side
of
the
dory
that
luther
davis
used
in
tending
his
lobster
pots
the
boat
turned
bottom
up
lay
high
above
tide
mark
in
the
little
cove
behind
the
point
quick
now
shouted
the
captain
in
a
tone
ralph
had
never
heard
him
use
before
over
with
her
lively
they
obeyed
him
without
question
as
the
dory
settled
right
side
up
two
heavy
oars
that
had
been
secured
by
being
thrust
under
the
seats
fell
back
with
a
clatter
what
was
it
captain
shouted
ralph
the
lifeboat
upset

many
did

he
moaned
wringing
his
hands
what
pashy

commanded
captain
eri
down
to
the
shore
with
her
now
they
dragged
the
dory
to
the
water
edge
with
one
rush
then
eri
hurriedly
thrust
in
the
tholepins
perez
protested
again
eri
he
said
it

but
ralph
hazeltine
intervened
i

he
said
firmly
putting
one
foot
over
the
gunwale
i
a
younger
man
than
either
of
you
and
i
used
to
a
boat
i
mean

i
captain
eri
looked
at
the
electrician
face
he
saw
nothing
but
determination
there
we
all
go
he
said
suddenly
mr
hazeltine
run
as
fast
as
the
lord
let
you
back
to
the
station
and
git
another
set
of
oars
hurry
without
answering
the
young
man
sprang
up
the
beach
and
ran
toward
the
buildings
the
moment
that
he
was
inside
captain
eri
leaped
into
the
dory
push
off
perez
he
commanded
that
young
feller
got
a
life
to
you
do
go
without
me
asserted
perez
stoutly
all
right
push
off
and
then
jump
captain
perez
attempted
to
obey
he
waded
into
the
water
and
gave
the
dory
a
push
but
just
as
he
was
about
to
scramble
in
he
received
a
shove
that
sent
him
backwards
your
job
takin
care
of
pashy
roared
captain
eri
perez
scrambled
to
his
feet
but
the
dory
was
already
across
the
little
patch
of
comparatively
smooth
water
in
the
cove
as
he
looked
he
saw
it
enter
the
first
line
of
breakers
rise
amid
a
shower
of
foam
poise
on
the
crest
and
slip
over
the
second
line
of
roaring
waves
came
surging
on
higher
and
more
threatening
than
the
first
captain
eri
glanced
over
his
shoulder
turned
the
dory
bow
toward
them
and
waited
they
broke
and
as
they
did
so
the
boat
shot
forward
into
the
whirlpool
of
froth
then
the
sleet
came
pouring
down
and
shut
everything
from
sight
when
ralph
came
hurrying
to
the
beach
bearing
the
oars
he
found
captain
perez
alone
chapter
xx
eri
goes
back
on
a
friend
captain
eri
knew
that
the
hardest
and
most
dangerous
portion
of
his
perilous
trip
was
just
at
its
beginning
if
the
dory
got
through
the
surf
without
capsizing
it
was
an
even
bet
that
she
would
stay
for
a
while
longer
at
any
rate
so
he
pulled
out
of
the
little
cove
and
pointed
the
boat
bow
toward
the
thundering
smother
of
white
his
shoulders
squared
his
hands
tightened
on
the
oar
handles
and
his
pushed
out
beyond
the
upper
old
foremast
hands
those
who
had
sailed
with
the
captain
on
his
coasting
voyages
would
had
they
seen
these
signs
have
prophesied
trouble
for
someone
they
were
captain
eri
and
just
now
his
opponent
was
the
gray
atlantic
if
the
latter
won
it
would
only
be
after
a
fight
the
first
wave
tripped
over
the
bar
and
whirled
beneath
him
sending
the
dory
high
into
the
air
and
splashing
its
occupant
with
spray
the
captain
held
the
boat
stationary
waiting
for
the
second
to
break
and
then
half
rising
put
all
his
weight
and
strength
on
the
oars
the
struggle
had
begun
they
used
to
say
on
board
the
hannah
that
the
skipper
never
got
rattled
the
same
cool
head
and
steady
nerve
that
josiah
had
admired
when
the
catboat
threaded
the
breakers
at
the
entrance
of
the
bay
now
served
the
same
purpose
in
this
more
tangled
and
infinitely
more
wicked
maze
the
dory
climbed
and
ducked
rolled
and
slid
but
gained
inch
by
inch
foot
by
foot
the
advancing
waves
struck
savage
blows
at
the
bow
the
wind
did
its
best
to
swing
her
broadside
on
but
there
was
one
hundred
and
eighty
pounds
of
clear
grit
and
muscle
tugging
at
the
oars
and
though
the
muscles
were
not
as
young
as
they
had
been
there
were
years
of
experience
to
make
every
pound
count
at
last
the
preliminary
round
was
over
the
boat
sprang
clear
of
the
breakers
and
crept
out
farther
and
farther
with
six
inches
of
water
slopping
in
her
bottom
but
afloat
and
seaworthy
it
was
not
until
she
was
far
into
deep
water
that
the
captain
turned
her
bow
down
the
shore
when
this
was
done
it
was
on
the
instant
and
although
a
little
more
water
came
inboard
there
was
not
enough
to
be
dangerous
then
with
the
gale
astern
and
the
tide
to
help
captain
eri
made
the
dory
go
as
she
or
any
other
on
that
coast
had
never
gone
before
the
captain
knew
that
the
wind
and
the
tide
that
were
now
aiding
him
were
also
sweeping
the
overturned
lifeboat
along
at
a
rapid
rate
he
must
come
up
with
it
before
it
reached
the
next
shoal
he
must
reach
it
before
the
waves
and
worse
than
all
the
cold
had
caused
the
poor
fellows
clinging
to
it
for
life
to
loose
their
grip
the
dory
jumped
from
crest
to
crest
like
a
hurdler
the
sleet
now
beat
directly
into
the
captain
face
and
froze
on
his
eyebrows
and
lashes
but
he
dared
not
draw
in
an
oar
to
free
a
hand
the
wind
caught
up
the
spindrift
and
poured
it
over
him
in
icy
baths
but
he
was
too
warm
from
the
furious
exercise
to
mind
in
the
lulls
he
turned
his
head
and
gazed
over
the
sea
looking
for
the
boat
once
he
saw
it
before
the
storm
shut
down
again
and
he
groaned
aloud
to
count
but
two
black
dots
on
its
white
surface
he
pulled
harder
than
ever
and
grunted
with
every
stroke
while
the
perspiration
poured
down
his
forehead
and
froze
when
it
reached
the
ice
dams
over
his
eyes
at
last
it
was
in
plain
sight
and
the
two
dots
now
clearly
human
beings
were
still
there
he
pointed
the
bow
straight
at
it
and
rowed
on
when
he
looked
again
there
was
but
one
a
figure
sprawled
along
the
keel
clinging
to
the
centerboard
the
flying
dory
bore
down
upon
the
lifeboat
and
the
captain
risked
what
little
breath
he
had
in
a
hail
the
clinging
figure
raised
its
head
and
captain
eri
felt
an
almost
selfish
sense
of
relief
to
see
that
it
was
luther
davis
if
it
had
to
be
but
one
he
would
rather
it
was
that
one
the
bottom
of
the
lifeboat
rose
like
a
dome
from
the
sea
that
beat
and
roared
over
and
around
it
the
centerboard
had
floated
up
and
projected
at
the
top
and
it
was
about
this
that
captain
davis
arms
were
clasped
captain
eri
shot
the
dory
alongside
pulled
in
one
oar
and
the
two
boats
fitted
closely
together
then
eri
reached
out
and
seizing
his
friend
by
the
belt
round
his
waist
pulled
him
from
his
hold
davis
fell
into
the
bottom
of
the
dory
only
half
conscious
and
entirely
helpless
captain
eri
lifted
him
so
that
his
head
and
shoulders
rested
on
a
thwart
and
then
setting
his
oar
against
the
lifeboat
side
pushed
the
dory
clear
then
he
began
rowing
again
so
far
he
had
been
more
successful
than
he
had
reason
to
expect
but
the
task
that
he
must
now
accomplish
was
not
less
difficult
he
must
reach
the
shore
safely
and
with
another
life
beside
his
own
to
guard
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
attempt
to
get
back
to
the
cove
the
landing
must
be
made
on
the
open
beach
and
although
captain
eri
had
more
than
once
brought
a
dory
safely
through
a
high
surf
he
had
never
attempted
it
when
his
boat
had
nearly
a
foot
of
water
in
her
and
carried
a
helpless
passenger
little
by
little
still
running
before
the
wind
the
captain
edged
in
toward
the
shore
luther
davis
moved
once
or
twice
but
said
nothing
his
oilskins
were
frozen
stiff
and
his
beard
was
a
lump
of
ice
captain
eri
began
to
fear
that
he
might
die
from
cold
and
exhaustion
before
the
attempt
at
landing
was
made
the
captain
resolved
to
wait
no
longer
but
to
take
the
risk
of
running
directly
for
the
beach
he
was
near
enough
now
to
see
the
leaping
spray
of
the
breakers
and
their
bellow
sounded
louder
than
the
howl
of
the
wind
or
the
noises
of
the
sea
about
him
he
bent
forward
and
shouted
in
the
ear
of
the
prostrate
luther
he
yelled
lute
captain
davis
head
rolled
back
his
eyes
opened
and
in
a
dazed
way
he
looked
at
the
figure
swinging
back
and
forth
with
the
oars
lute
shouted
captain
eri
listen
to
me
i
goin
to
try
to
land
hear
me
davis
thoughts
seemed
to
be
gathering
slowly
he
was
ordinarily
a
man
of
strong
physique
courageous
and
a
fighter
every
inch
of
him
but
his
strength
had
been
beaten
out
by
the
waves
and
chilled
by
the
cold
and
the
sight
of
the
men
with
whom
he
had
lived
and
worked
for
years
drowning
one
by
one
had
broken
his
nerve
he
looked
at
his
friend
and
then
at
the
waves
what
the
use
he
said
feebly
they
all
gone
i
might
as
well
go
captain
eri
eyes
snapped
lute
davis
he
exclaimed
i
never
thought
i
see
you
playin
crybaby
brace
up
what
are
you
anyway
the
man
made
a
plucky
effort
all
right
eri
he
said
i
with
you
but
i
ai
much
can
you
stand
up
i
do
know
i
little
by
little
he
raised
himself
to
his
knees
as
fur
i
can
go
eri
he
said
between
his
teeth
you
look
out
for
yourself
i
do
my
the
dory
was
caught
by
the
first
of
the
great
waves
and
on
its
crest
went
flying
toward
the
beach
captain
eri
steered
it
with
the
oars
as
well
as
he
could
the
wave
broke
and
the
boat
paused
was
caught
up
by
the
succeeding
breaker
and
thrown
forward
again
the
captain
still
trying
to
steer
with
one
oar
let
go
of
the
other
and
seizing
his
companion
by
the
belt
pulled
him
to
his
feet
now
then
he
shouted
stand
by
the
boat
poised
on
the
curling
wave
went
down
like
a
hammer
struck
the
sand
and
was
buried
in
water
just
as
it
struck
captain
eri
jumped
as
far
shoreward
as
he
could
davis
sprang
with
him
but
it
was
really
the
captain
strength
that
carried
them
clear
of
the
rail
they
kept
their
feet
for
an
instant
but
in
that
instant
captain
eri
dragged
his
friend
a
yard
or
so
up
the
shelving
beach
then
they
were
knocked
flat
by
the
next
wave
the
captain
dug
his
toes
into
the
sand
and
braced
himself
as
the
undertow
sucked
back
once
more
he
rose
and
they
staggered
on
again
only
to
go
down
when
the
next
rush
of
water
came
three
times
this
performance
was
repeated
and
as
they
rose
for
the
fourth
time
the
captain
roared
now
another
plunge
a
splashing
run
and
they
were
on
the
hard
sand
of
the
beach
then
they
both
tumbled
on
their
faces
and
breathed
in
great
gasps
but
the
captain
realized
that
this
would
not
do
for
in
their
soaked
condition
freezing
to
death
was
a
matter
of
but
a
short
time
he
seized
davis
by
the
shoulder
and
shook
him
again
and
again
come
on
lute
come
on
he
insisted
git
up
you
got
to
git
up
and
after
a
while
the
did
get
up
although
he
could
scarcely
stand
then
with
the
captain
arm
around
his
waist
they
started
slowly
up
the
beach
toward
the
station
they
had
gone
but
a
little
way
when
they
were
met
by
ralph
hazeltine
and
captain
perez
mrs
snow
had
been
for
her
rather
nervous
all
that
forenoon
she
performed
her
household
duties
as
thoroughly
as
usual
but
elsie
to
whom
the
storm
had
brought
a
holiday
noticed
that
she
looked
out
of
the
window
and
at
the
clock
frequently
once
she
even
went
so
far
as
to
tell
the
young
lady
that
she
felt
kind
of
queer
jest
as
if
somethin
was
goin
to
as
the
housekeeper
was
not
the
kind
to
be
troubled
with
presentiments
elsie
was
surprised
dinner
was
on
the
table
at
twelve
but
captain
eri
was
not
there
to
help
eat
it
and
they
sat
down
without
him
and
here
again
mrs
snow
departed
from
her
regular
habit
for
she
ate
little
and
was
very
quiet
she
was
the
first
to
hear
an
unusual
sound
outside
and
jumping
up
ran
to
the
window
somebody
drivin
into
the
yard
she
said
who
on
airth
would
be
comin
here
such
a
day
as
this
captain
jerry
joined
her
at
the
window
it
abner
mayo
horse
he
said
maybe
it
perez
comin
it
was
not
captain
perez
but
mayo
himself
as
they
saw
when
the
rubber
blanket
fastened
across
the
front
of
the
buggy
was
dropped
and
the
driver
sprang
out
mrs
snow
opened
the
door
for
him
hello
abner
exclaimed
captain
jerry
as
the
newcomer
stopped
to
knock
the
snow
from
his
boots
before
coming
in
what
have
you
done
to
perez

but
mayo

important
news
to

he
did

the
effect
of
his
sensation
by
springing
it
without

preparation

took

solemnly
declined

proffered
chair

bang
with

when

dory
that

afraid
broke
his
arm
i
goin
right
back
to

they
tried
to

captain

completely
demoralized
by
the
news
that
dreadful
i
must
go
right
down
there
must
i
the
poor
fellers
mrs
snow
rose
to
her
feet
quietly
but
with
a
determined
air
are
you
goin
right
back
soon
you
got
the
doctor
mayo
she
asked
why
no
i
i
ai
been
to
my
store
this
mornin
and
i
ought
to
be
to
be
frank
abner
was
too
great
a
sensation
lover
to
forfeit
the
opportunity
of
springing
his
startling
news
on
the
community
then
josiah
you
have
to
harness
and
take
me
down
i
wait
another
why
mrs
snow
expostulated
captain
jerry
you
must
go
down
there
the
doctor

and
i
go
and
pashy
there
but
the
housekeeper
merely
waved
him
aside
i
want
you
to
stay
here
with
elsie
she
said
there
no
tellin
how
long
i
may
be
gone
josiah
drive
me
down
wo
you
josiah
there
was
no
lack
of
enthusiasm
in
the
able
seaman
answer
the
boy
was
only
too
glad
of
the
chance
but
it
ai
fit
weather
for
you
to
be
out
in
you
git
soakin
i
guess
if
pashy
davis
can
stand
it
i
can
elsie
will
you
come
and
help
me
git
ready
while
josiah
harnessin
as
they
entered
the
chamber
above
elsie
was
thunderstruck
to
see
her
companion
seat
herself
in
the
rocker
and
cover
her
face
with
her
hands
if
it
had
been
anyone
else
it
would
not
have
been
so
astonishing
but
the
cool
housekeeper
she
could
scarcely
believe
it
why
mrs
snow
she
exclaimed
what
is
it
the
lady
from
nantucket
hastily
rose
and
wiped
her
eyes
with
her
apron
oh
nothin
she
answered
with
an
attempt
at
a
smile
i
kind
of
fidgety
this
mornin
and
the
way
that
man
started
off
to
tell
his
yarn
upset
me
that
all
i
must
be
such
a
she
set
about
getting
ready
with
a
vim
and
attention
to
detail
that
proved
that
her
fidgets
had
not
affected
her
she
was
pale
and
her
hands
trembled
a
little
but
she
took
a
covered
basket
and
packed
in
it
cloth
for
bandages
a
bottle
mustard
a
bottle
of
liniment
and
numerous
other
things
likely
to
be
of
use
last
of
all
she
added
a
bottle
of
whisky
that
had
been
prescribed
as
a
stimulant
for
john
baxter
i
some
folks
would
think
was
terrible
carryin
this
with
me
she
observed
a
woman
pitched
into
me
once
for
givin
it
to
her
husband
when
he
was
sick
i
told
her
i
did
favor
rhubarb
as
a
steady
drink
but
i
hoped
i
knew
enough
to
give
it
when
was
ralph
and
captain
perez
were
surprised
men
when
the
housekeeper
dripping
but
cheerful
appeared
on
the
scene
she
and
josiah
had
had
a
stormy
passage
on
the
way
down
for
the
daniel
had
objected
to
being
asked
to
trot
through
drifts
and
mrs
snow
had
insisted
that
he
should
be
made
to
do
it
the
ford
was
out
of
the
question
so
they
stalled
the
old
horse
in
the
mayo
barn
and
borrowed
abner
dory
to
make
the
crossing
mrs
snow
took
charge
at
once
of
the
tired
men
and
the
overtaxed
miss
patience
was
glad
enough
to
have
her
do
it
luther
davis
was
in
bed
and
captain
eri
after
an
hour
sojourn
in
the
same
snug
harbor
had
utterly
refused
to
stay
there
longer
and
now
dressed
in
a
suit
belonging
to
the
commandant
was
stretched
upon
a
sofa
in
the
front
room
the
captain
was
the
most
surprised
of
all
when
mrs
snow
appeared
he
fairly
gasped
when
she
first
entered
the
room
and
seemed
to
be
struck
speechless
for
he
said
scarcely
a
word
while
she
dosed
him
with
hot
drinks
rubbed
his
shoulder
the
bone
was
not
broken
but
there
was
a
bruise
there
as
big
as
a
saucer
with
the
liniment
and
made
him
generally
comfortable
he
watched
her
every
movement
with
a
sort
of
worshipful
wonder
and
seemed
to
be
thinking
hard
captain
davis
although
feeling
a
little
better
was
still
very
weak
and
his
sister
and
captain
perez
were
with
him
josiah
soon
returned
to
the
mayo
homestead
to
act
as
ferryman
for
palmer
when
the
latter
should
arrive
and
ralph
finding
that
there
was
nothing
more
that
he
could
do
went
back
to
the
cable
station
the
storm
had
abated
somewhat
and
the
wind
had
gone
down
captain
eri
and
mrs
snow
were
alone
in
the
front
room
and
for
the
first
time
since
she
entered
the
house
the
lady
from
nantucket
sat
down
to
rest
then
the
captain
spoke
mrs
snow
he
said
gravely
i
do
believe
you
changed
your
clothes
sence
you
got
here
you
must
have
been
soaked
through
too
i
wish
you
would
take
such
risks
you
had
ought
to
have
come
over
here
a
day
like
this
anyway
not
but
what
the
lord
knows
it
good
to
have
you
here
he
added
hastily
the
housekeeper
seemed
surprised
eri
she
said
i
if
you
was
dyin
you
worry
for
fear
somebody
else
would
be
while
you
was
doing
it
be
pretty
hard
for
me
to
change
my
clothes
she
added
with
a
laugh
seein
that
there
probably
ai
anything
but
men
clothes
in
the
then
with
a
sigh
poor
fellers
they
wo
need
any
that
so
and
they
were
all
alive
and
hearty
this
mornin
it
an
awful
thing
for
luther
has
he
told
anything
yit
how
it
come
to
happen
yes
a
little
the
schooner
was
from
maine
bound
to
new
york
besides
her
own
crew
she
had
some
italians
aboard
they
was
goin
over
on
a
job
for
the
owner
davis
says
he
saw
right
away
that
the
lifeboat
would
be
overloaded
but
he
had
to
take
all
there
time
for
a
second
trip
he
made
the
schooner
crew
and
the
others
lay
down
in
the
boat
where
they
would
hinder
the
men
at
the
oars
but
when
they
got
jest
at
the
tail
of
the
shoal
where
the
sea
was
heaviest
them
italians
lost
their
heads
and
commenced
to
stand
up
and
yell
and
fust
thing
you
know
she
swung
broadside
on
and
capsized
pashy
says
luther
do
say
much
more
but
she
jedges
from
what
he
does
say
that
some
of
the
men
hung
on
with
him
for
a
while
but
was
washed
off
and
that
right
there
was
four
or
five
there
when
we
saw
her
fust
was
lute
grip
on
the
centerboard
that
saved
him
it
an
awful
thing
awful
yes
and
he
would
have
gone
too
if
it
had
been
for
you
and
you
talk
about
my
takin
risks
well
jerry
had
ought
to
have
let
you
let
me
come
i
should
like
to
have
seen
him
try
to
stop
me
the
idea
where
would
i
be
if
helpin
you
after
all
you
done
for
me
i
done
i
have
done
anything
you
made
me
happier
i
been
for
years
you
been
so
kind
that
that
she
stopped
and
looked
out
of
the
window
it
you
that
been
kind
said
the
captain
you
made
a
home
for
me
somethin
i
ai
had
afore
sence
i
was
a
mrs
snow
went
on
as
if
he
had
not
spoken
and
to
think
that
you
might
have
been
drownded
the
same
as
the
rest
she
said
i
knew
somethin
was
happenin
i
jest
felt
it
somehow
i
told
elsie
i
was
sure
of
it
i
could
think
of
anything
but
you
all
the
the
captain
sat
up
on
the
couch
marthy
he
said
in
an
awed
tone
do
you
know
what
i
was
thinkin
of
when
i
was
pullin
through
the
wust
of
it
this
mornin
i
was
of
you
i
thought
of
luther
and
the
rest
of
them
poor
souls
of
course
but
i
thought
of
you
most
of
the
time
it
kept
comin
back
to
me
that
if
i
went
under
i
should
see
you
and
you
was
thinkin
of
me
yes
when
that
mayo
man
said
he
had
awful
news
i
felt
sure
was
you
he
was
goin
to
tell
about
i
never
fainted
away
in
my
life
that
i
know
of
but
i
think
i
fainted
and
you
cared
as
much
as
that
somehow
both
were
speaking
quietly
but
as
if
it
was
useless
longer
to
keep
back
anything
to
speak
the
exact
truth
without
reserve
seemed
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
well
well
well
said
the
captain
reverently
and
still
in
the
same
low
tone
i
said
once
afore
that
i
you
was
sent
here
and
now
i
sure
of
it
it
seems
almost
as
if
you
was
sent
to
me
do
it
the
housekeeper
still
looked
out
of
the
window
but
she
answered
simply
i
do
it
does
it
does
so
marthy
we
been
happy
together
while
been
here
do
you
you
could
be
happy
with
me
always
if
you
married
me
i
mean
mrs
snow
turned
and
looked
at
him
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
but
she
did
not
wipe
them
away
yes
she
said
think
now
marthy
i
ai
very
young
and
i
ai
very
what
am
i
with
a
little
smile
and
you
really
think
you
could
be
happy
if
you
was
the
wife
of
an
old
codger
like
me
the
answer
was
short
but
it
was
convincing
captain
eri
rose
to
his
feet
gosh
he
said
in
a
sort
of
unbelieving
whisper
marthy
are
you
willin
to
try
and
again
mrs
snow
said
when
palmer
came
he
found
luther
davis
still
in
bed
but
captain
eri
was
up
and
dressed
and
there
was
such
a
quiet
air
of
happiness
about
him
that
the
man
of
medicine
was
amazed
good
lord
man
he
exclaimed
i
expected
to
find
you
flat
on
your
back
and
you
look
better
than
i
seen
you
for
years
taking
a
bath
in
must
agree
with
it
ai
so
much
that
replied
the
captain
serenely
it
the
pay
i
got
for
takin
when
the
doctor
saw
perez
alone
he
asked
the
latter
to
keep
a
close
watch
on
captain
eri
behavior
he
said
he
was
afraid
that
the
exertion
and
exposure
might
have
affected
the
captain
brain
perez
alarmed
by
this
caution
did
watch
his
friend
very
closely
but
he
saw
nothing
to
frighten
him
until
as
they
were
about
to
start
for
home
captain
eri
suddenly
struck
his
thigh
a
resounding
slap
jerry
he
groaned
distressfully
i
clean
forgot
i
gone
back
on
jerry
chapter
xxi
elsie
and
captain
jerry
were
kept
busy
that
afternoon
abner
mayo
news
spread
quickly
and
people
gathered
at
the
the
stores
and
the
billiard
room
to
discuss
it
some
of
the
men
notably
cy
warner
and
rufe
smith
local
representatives
of
the
big
boston
dailies
hurried
off
to
the
station
to
get
the
facts
at
first
hand
others
came
down
to
talk
with
captain
jerry
and
elsie
melissa
shawl
was
on
her
shoulders
and
her
cloud
was
tied
about
her
head
in
less
than
two
minutes
after
her
neighbor
shouted
the
story
across
the
back
yards
she
had
just
left
the
house
and
captain
jerry
was
delivering
a
sarcastic
speech
concerning
talkin
machines
when
daniel
plodded
through
the
gate
drawing
the
buggy
containing
josiah
mrs
snow
and
captain
eri
for
a
man
who
had
been
described
as
captain
eri
looked
very
well
indeed
jerry
ran
to
help
him
from
the
carriage
but
he
jumped
out
himself
and
then
assisted
the
housekeeper
to
alight
with
an
air
of
proud
proprietorship
he
was
welcomed
to
the
house
like
a
returned
prodigal
and
captain
jerry
shook
his
well
hand
until
the
arm
belonging
to
it
seemed
likely
to
become
as
stiff
and
sore
as
the
other
while
this
handshaking
was
going
on
captain
eri
was
embarrassed
he
did
not
look
his
friend
in
the
face
and
most
of
his
conversation
was
addressed
to
elsie
as
soon
as
he
had
warmed
his
hands
and
told
the
story
of
the
wreck
and
rescue
he
said
jerry
come
up
to
my
room
a
minute
wo
you
got
somethin
i
want
to
vaguely
wondering
what
the
private
conversation
might
be
jerry
followed
his
friend
upstairs
when
they
were
in
the
room
captain
eri
closed
the
door
and
faced
his
companion
he
was
confused
and
stammered
a
little
as
he
said
jerry
i
i
got
somethin
to
say
to
you
then
it
was
captain
jerry
turn
to
be
confused
now
eri
he
protested
fair
to
keep
pesterin
me
like
this
i
know
i
ai
said
nothin
to
her
yit
but
i
goin
to
i
had
a
week
anyhow
and
it
ai
over
land
sake
he
burst
forth
i
ai
been
thinkin
it
i
ai
thought
of
nothin
else
hardly
i
bet
you
i
been
over
the
whole
thing
every
night
sence
we
had
that
talk
i
go
over
it
and
go
over
it
i
thought
of
more
a
million
ways
to
ask
her
but
there
ai
one
of
that
suits
me
if
i
was
goin
to
be
hung
be
no
worse
and
now
you
got
to
keep
let
me
alone
till
my
time
is
up
ca
you
i
naggin
i
was
jest
goin
to
tell
you
that
you
wo
have
to
ask
i
been
talkin
to
her
myself
and
the
sacrifice
sprang
out
of
his
chair
eri
hedge
he
exclaimed
indignantly
i
thought
you
was
a
friend
of
mine
i
give
you
my
word
i
do
it
in
a
week
and
the
least
you
could
have
done
seems
to
me
would
have
been
to
wait
and
give
me
the
chance
but
no
all
you
think
yourself
so
she
say
no
and
lose
your
old
housekeeper
you
the
idea
she
must
think
i
a
good
one
ca
do
my
own
courtin
and
have
to
git
somebody
to
do
it
for
me
what
did
she
say
he
asked
suddenly
she
said
yes
to
what
i
asked
her
was
the
reply
with
a
half
smile
upon
captain
jerry
face
settled
the
look
of
one
who
accepts
the
melancholy
inevitable
he
sat
down
again
i
she
would
he
said
with
a
sigh
she
known
me
for
quite
a
spell
now
and
she
had
a
chance
to
see
what
kind
of
a
man
i
be
well
what
else
did
you
do
ai
settled
the
weddin
day
have
you
this
with
marked
sarcasm
not
yit
jerry
you
made
a
mistake
i
did
ask
her
for
did
ask
her
did
what
are
you
talkin
then
i
asked
her
for
myself
she
goin
to
marry
captain
jerry
was
too
much
astonished
even
to
get
up
instead
he
simply
sat
still
with
open
mouth
while
his
friend
continued
i
come
to
think
a
lot
of
mrs
snow
sence
she
been
here
captain
eri
said
slowly
and
i
found
out
that
she
felt
the
same
way
me
i
kept
still
and
said
nothin
i
thought
you
ought
to
have
the
fust
chance
and
besides
i
did
know
how
she
felt
but
while
we
was
talkin
it
all
come
out
of
itself
seems
so
and
well
we
goin
to
be
the
sacrifice
a
sacrifice
no
longer
still
sat
silent
but
curious
changes
of
expression
were
passing
over
his
face
surprise
amazement
relief
and
now
a
sort
of
grieved
resignation
i
feel
small
enough
the
way
i
treated
you
jerry
continued
captain
eri
i
did
mean
to
but
there
it
done
and
all
i
can
do
is
say
i
sorry
and
that
i
meant
to
give
you
your
chance
i
blame
you
if
you
git
mad
not
a
bit
but
i
hope
you
captain
jerry
sighed
when
he
spoke
it
was
in
a
tone
of
sublime
forgiveness
eri
he
said
i
ai
mad
i
wo
say
my
feelin
ai
hurt
well
never
mind
if
a
wife
and
a
home
ai
for
me
why
i
ought
to
be
glad
that
you
goin
to
have
i
wish
you
both
luck
and
a
good
now
do
talk
to
me
for
a
few
minutes
let
me
git
sort
of
used
to
so
they
shook
hands
and
captain
eri
with
a
troubled
look
at
his
friend
went
out
after
he
had
gone
captain
jerry
got
up
and
danced
three
steps
of
an
improvised
jig
his
face
one
broad
grin
then
with
an
effort
he
sobered
down
assumed
an
air
of
due
solemnity
and
tramped
downstairs
if
the
announcement
of
captain
perez
engagement
caused
no
surprise
that
of
captain
eri
certainly
did
surprise
and
congratulation
on
the
part
of
those
let
into
the
secret
for
it
was
decided
to
say
nothing
to
outsiders
as
yet
ralph
came
over
that
evening
and
they
told
him
about
it
and
he
was
as
pleased
as
the
rest
as
for
the
captain
he
was
only
too
willing
to
shake
hands
with
any
and
everybody
although
he
insisted
that
the
housekeeper
had
nothing
to
be
congratulated
upon
and
that
she
was
takin
big
the
lady
herself
merely
smiled
at
this
and
quietly
said
that
she
was
willing
to
take
them
the
storm
had
wrecked
every
wire
and
stalled
every
train
and
orham
was
isolated
for
two
days
then
communication
was
established
once
more
and
the
boston
dailies
received
the
news
of
the
loss
of
the
and
the
crew
of
the
schooner
and
they
made
the
most
of
it
sensational
items
were
scarce
just
then
and
the
editors
welcomed
this
one
the
big
black
headlines
spread
halfway
across
the
front
pages
there
were
pictures
of
the
wreck
drawn
by
our
artist
from
description
and
there
were
descriptions
of
all
kinds
special
reporters
arrived
in
the
village
and
interviewed
everyone
they
could
lay
hands
on
abner
mayo
felt
that
for
once
he
was
receiving
the
attention
he
deserved
the
station
and
the
house
by
the
shore
were
besieged
by
photographers
and
newspaper
men
captain
eri
indignantly
refused
to
pose
for
his
photograph
so
he
was
snapped
as
he
went
out
to
the
barn
and
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
a
likeness
of
himself
somewhat
out
of
focus
and
with
one
leg
stiffly
elevated
in
the
sunday
blanket
the
reporters
waylaid
him
at
the
or
at
his
fish
shanty
and
begged
for
interviews
they
got
them
brief
and
pointedly
personal
and
though
these
were
not
printed
columns
describing
him
as
a
bluff
hero
were
if
ever
a
man
was
mad
and
disgusted
that
man
was
the
captain
in
the
first
place
as
he
said
what
he
had
done
was
nothing
more
than
any
other
man
would
have
done
and
secondly
it
was
business
then
again
he
said
and
with
truth
this
whole
fuss
makes
me
sick
here
them
fellers
in
the
crew
been
goin
out
season
after
season
takin
folks
off
wrecks
and
the
fool
papers
never
say
nothin
it
but
they
go
out
this
time
and
save
nobody
and
git
drownded
themselves
and
they
heroes
of
a
sudden
i
hear
they
raisin
money
up
to
boston
to
give
to
the
widders
and
orphans
well
that
all
right
but
they
better
keep
on
and
git
the
to
raise
the
of
them
that
left
in
the
the
climax
came
when
a
flashily
dressed
stranger
called
and
insisted
upon
seeing
the
captain
alone
the
interview
lasted
just
about
three
minutes
when
mrs
snow
alarmed
by
the
commotion
rushed
into
the
room
she
found
captain
eri
in
the
act
of
throwing
after
the
fleeing
stranger
the
shiny
silk
hat
that
the
latter
had
left
behind
do
you
know
what
that
that
swab
wanted
hotly
demanded
the
indignant
captain
he
wanted
me
to
rig
up
in
ileskins
and
a
and
show
myself
in
dime
museums
said
he
buy
that
dory
of
luther
that
i
went
out
in
and
show
that
with
me
i
told
him
that
dory
was
spread
up
and
down
the
beach
from
here
to
setuckit
but
he
said
that
make
no
he
have
a
dory
there
and
say
was
the
reel
one
offered
me
a
hundred
dollars
a
week
the
skate
i
give
ten
dollars
right
now
to
tell
him
the
rest
of
what
i
had
to
after
this
the
captain
went
fishing
every
day
and
when
at
home
refused
to
see
anybody
not
known
personally
but
the
agitation
went
on
for
the
papers
fed
the
flames
and
in
boston
they
were
raising
a
purse
to
buy
gold
watches
and
medals
for
him
and
for
captain
davis
shortly
after
four
one
afternoon
of
the
week
following
that
of
the
wreck
captain
eri
ventured
to
walk
up
to
the
village
keeping
a
weather
eye
out
for
reporters
and
smoking
his
pipe
he
made
several
stops
one
of
them
being
at
the
schoolhouse
where
josiah
now
back
at
his
desk
was
studying
overtime
to
catch
up
with
his
class
as
the
captain
was
strolling
along
someone
touched
him
from
behind
and
he
turned
to
face
ralph
hazeltine
the
electrician
had
been
a
pretty
regular
caller
at
the
house
of
late
but
captain
eri
had
seen
but
little
of
him
for
reasons
unnecessary
to
state
hello
captain
said
ralph
taking
a
constitutional
you
want
to
look
out
for
warner
i
hear
he
after
you
for
another
rescue
he
need
somebody
to
rescue
him
if
he
comes
pesterin
me
was
the
reply
you
ai
seen
my
dime
show
friend
nowheres
have
you
i
sort
of
like
to
meet
him
again
our
other
talk
broke
off
kind
of
ralph
laughed
and
said
he
was
afraid
that
the
museum
manager
come
to
orham
again
very
soon
i
likely
not
chuckled
captain
eri
i
ought
to
have
kept
his
hat
then
maybe
he
have
come
back
after
it
oh
say
he
added
i
been
meanin
to
ask
you
somethin
made
up
your
mind
that
western
job
yit
ralph
shook
his
head
not
yet
he
said
slowly
i
shall
very
soon
though
i
kind
of
puzzlin
you
is
it
not
that
it
really
any
of
my
affairs
you
understand
there
only
a
few
of
us
good
folks
left
as
the
feller
said
and
i
hate
to
see
you
leave
that
i
am
not
anxious
to
go
myself
my
present
position
gives
me
a
good
deal
of
leisure
time
for
experimental
work
and
well
i
tell
you
in
confidence
there
a
possibility
of
my
becoming
superintendent
one
of
these
days
if
i
wish
sho
you
do
say
langley
goin
to
quit
he
is
thinking
of
it
the
old
gentleman
has
saved
some
money
and
he
has
a
sister
in
the
west
who
is
anxious
to
have
him
come
out
there
and
spend
the
remainder
of
his
days
with
her
if
he
does
i
can
have
his
position
i
guess
in
fact
he
has
been
good
enough
to
say
well
that
pretty
fine
ai
it
langley
ai
the
man
to
chuck
his
good
opinions
round
like
clam
shells
you
ought
to
feel
i
suppose
i
they
walked
on
silently
for
a
few
steps
the
captain
waiting
for
his
companion
to
speak
and
the
latter
seeming
disinclined
to
do
so
at
length
the
older
man
asked
another
question
is
job
so
much
better
silence
again
then
ralph
said
the
other
position
captain
is
very
much
like
this
one
in
some
respects
it
will
place
me
in
a
country
town
even
smaller
than
orham
where
there
are
few
young
people
no
amusements
and
no
society
in
the
fashionable
sense
of
the
humph
i
thought
you
did
care
much
for
them
i
to
this
enigmatical
answer
the
captain
made
no
immediate
reply
after
a
moment
however
he
said
slowly
and
with
apparent
irrelevance
mr
hazeltine
i
can
remember
my
father
tellin
a
feller
that
lived
down
on
the
south
harniss
shore
when
he
was
a
boy
queer
old
chap
he
was
named
elihu
bassett
everybody
called
him
uncle
elihu
in
them
days
all
hands
drunk
more
or
less
rum
and
uncle
elihu
drunk
more
he
had
a
way
of
stayin
sober
for
a
spell
and
then
startin
off
on
a
regular
jamboree
all
by
himself
he
had
an
old
boat
that
he
used
to
sail
in
but
she
broke
her
moorin
one
time
and
got
smashed
up
so
he
wanted
to
buy
another
shadrach
wingate
seth
granddad
tried
to
fix
up
a
dicker
with
him
for
a
boat
he
had
they
agreed
on
the
price
and
everything
was
all
right
that
uncle
elihu
stuck
out
that
he
must
try
her
he
bought
her
so
shad
give
in
and
uncle
elihu
sailed
over
to
wellmouth
in
the
boat
he
put
in
his
time
the
tavern
there
and
when
he
come
down
to
the
boat
he
had
a
jugful
of
medford
in
his
hand
and
pretty
nigh
as
much
of
the
same
stuff
under
his
hatches
he
got
afloat
somehow
the
sail
lashed
the
tiller
after
a
fashion
took
a
nip
out
of
the
jug
and
tumbled
over
and
went
fast
asleep
was
a
still
night
or
have
been
the
finish
as
was
he
run
aground
on
a
flat
and
stuck
there
till
mornin
next
day
back
he
comes
with
the
boat
all
scraped
up
and
says
he
wo
do
shad
she
do
keep
her
course
keep
her
course
you
old
fool
bellers
shad
you
tight
as
a
drumhead
and
sound
asleep
think
she
can
find
her
way
home
herself
he
says
says
uncle
elihu
she
ca
she
ai
the
boat
for
me
ralph
laughed
i
see
he
said
perhaps
uncle
elihu
was
wise
still
if
he
wanted
the
boat
very
much
he
must
have
hated
to
put
her
to
the
that
so
assented
the
captain
but
was
better
to
know
it
then
than
to
be
sorry
for
it
both
seemed
to
be
thinking
and
neither
spoke
again
until
they
came
to
the
grocery
store
where
hazeltine
stopped
saying
that
he
must
do
an
errand
for
langley
they
said
and
the
captain
turned
away
but
came
quickly
back
and
said
mr
hazeltine
if
it
ai
too
much
trouble
would
you
mind
up
to
the
schoolhouse
when
you
done
your
errand
i
left
there
with
josiah
and
i
like
to
have
you
git
it
will
you
certainly
was
the
reply
and
it
was
not
until
the
captain
had
gone
that
ralph
remembered
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
to
get
when
he
reached
the
school
he
climbed
the
stairs
and
opened
the
door
expecting
to
find
josiah
alone
instead
there
was
no
one
there
but
elsie
who
was
sitting
at
the
desk
she
sprang
up
as
he
entered
both
were
somewhat
confused
pardon
me
miss
preston
he
said
captain
eri
sent
me
here
he
said
he
left
something
with
josiah
and
wished
me
to
call
for
why
i
sure
i
do
know
what
it
can
be
replied
elsie
josiah
has
been
gone
for
some
time
and
he
said
nothing
to
me
about
perhaps
it
is
in
his
desk
suggested
ralph
suppose
we
so
they
looked
but
found
nothing
more
than
the
usual
assortment
contained
in
the
desk
of
a
healthy
schoolboy
the
raised
lid
shut
off
the
light
from
the
window
and
the
desk
interior
was
rather
dark
they
had
to
grope
in
the
corners
and
occasionally
their
hands
touched
every
time
this
happened
ralph
thought
of
the
decision
that
he
must
make
so
soon
he
thought
of
it
still
more
when
after
the
search
was
abandoned
elsie
suggested
that
he
help
her
with
some
problems
that
she
was
preparing
for
the
next
day
labors
of
the
first
class
in
arithmetic
in
fact
as
he
sat
beside
her
pretending
to
figure
but
really
watching
her
dainty
profile
as
it
moved
back
and
forth
before
his
eyes
his
own
particular
problem
received
far
more
attention
than
did
those
of
the
class
suddenly
he
spoke
teacher
he
said
please
may
i
ask
a
question
you
should
hold
up
your
hand
if
you
wish
permission
to
speak
was
the
stern
reply
please
consider
it
held
is
the
question
as
important
as
many
bushels
did
c
sell
which
happens
to
be
my
particular
trouble
just
it
is
to
me
ralph
was
serious
enough
now
it
is
a
question
that
i
have
been
wrestling
with
for
some
time
it
is
shall
i
take
the
position
that
has
been
offered
me
in
the
west
or
shall
i
stay
here
and
become
superintendent
of
the
station
the
place
may
be
mine
i
think
if
i
want
elsie
laid
down
her
pencil
and
hesitated
for
a
moment
before
she
spoke
when
she
did
reply
her
face
was
turned
away
from
her
companion
i
should
think
that
question
might
best
be
decided
by
comparing
the
salaries
and
prospects
of
the
two
positions
she
said
quietly
the
two
positions
are
much
alike
in
one
way
you
know
what
the
life
at
the
station
means
the
greater
portion
of
the
year
no
companions
of
your
own
age
and
condition
no
society
no
amusements
the
western
offer
means
all
this
and
worse
for
the
situation
is
the
same
all
the
year
i
say
these
things
because
i
hope
you
may
be
willing
to
consider
them
not
from
my
point
of
view
solely
but
from
from
mine
yes
you
see
i
am
recklessly
daring
to
hope
that
whichever
lot
is
chosen
you
may
be
willing
to
share
it
with
me
as
my
wife
elsie
do
you
think
you
could
consider
the
question
from
that
viewpoint
and
well
elsie
thought
she
could
the
consideration
we
suppose
it
was
the
consideration
took
so
long
that
it
was
nearly
dark
when
elsie
announced
that
she
simply
must
go
it
was
ralph
duty
as
a
gentleman
to
help
her
in
putting
on
her
coat
and
this
took
an
astonishingly
long
time
finally
it
was
done
however
and
they
came
downstairs
dearest
said
ralph
after
the
door
was
locked
i
forgot
to
have
another
hunt
for
whatever
it
was
that
captain
eri
wanted
me
to
elsie
smiled
rather
oddly
are
you
sure
you
have
got
it
she
asked
demurely
got
it
why
why
by
george
what
a
numbskull
i
am
the
old
rascal
i
thought
there
was
a
twinkle
in
his
he
said
he
should
come
back
after
well
well
bless
his
heart
it
sound
and
sweet
all
the
way
through
yes
i
have
got
it
and
what
more
i
shall
tell
him
that
i
mean
to
keep
the
gold
watches
from
the
people
to
the
heroes
of
the
orham
wreck
having
been
duly
bought
and
inscribed
and
the
medals
struck
there
came
up
the
question
of
presentation
and
it
was
decided
to
perform
the
ceremony
in
the
orham
town
hall
and
to
make
the
occasion
notable
the
congressman
from
the
district
agreed
to
make
the
necessary
speech
the
harniss
cornet
band
was
to
furnish
music
all
preparations
were
made
and
it
remained
only
to
secure
the
consent
of
the
parties
most
interested
namely
captain
eri
and
luther
davis
and
this
was
the
hardest
task
of
all
both
men
at
first
flatly
refused
to
be
present
the
captain
said
he
might
as
well
go
to
the
dime
museum
and
be
done
with
it
he
was
much
obliged
to
the
boston
folks
but
his
own
watch
was
keeping
good
time
and
he
did
need
a
new
one
badly
enough
to
make
a
show
of
himself
to
get
it
captain
davis
said
very
much
the
same
but
miss
patience
was
proud
of
her
brother
rise
to
fame
and
intend
to
let
him
forfeit
the
crowning
glory
she
enlisted
captain
perez
as
a
supporter
and
together
they
finally
got
luther
unwilling
consent
to
sit
on
the
platform
and
be
stared
at
for
one
evening
meanwhile
captain
jerry
elsie
ralph
and
mrs
snow
were
doing
their
best
to
win
captain
eri
over
when
luther
surrendered
the
forces
joined
and
the
captain
threw
up
his
hands
all
right
he
said
only
i
ought
to
beg
that
dime
museum
pardon
right
to
be
partial
this
the
hall
was
jammed
to
the
doors
captain
eri
seated
on
the
platform
at
one
end
of
the
of
selectmen
local
politicians
and
minor
celebrities
looked
from
the
congressman
in
the
middle
to
luther
on
the
other
end
and
then
out
over
the
crowded
settees
he
saw
mrs
pleasant
wholesome
face
beaming
proudly
beside
captain
jerry
red
one
he
saw
captain
perez
and
miss
patience
sitting
together
close
to
the
front
and
ralph
and
elsie
a
little
further
back
the
reverend
perley
was
there
so
were
the
smalls
and
miss
abigail
mullett
melissa
busteed
was
on
the
very
front
bench
with
the
boys
of
whom
josiah
was
one
the
train
committee
was
there
not
a
member
missing
and
at
the
rear
of
the
hall
smiling
and
unctuous
as
ever
was
web
saunders
in
spite
of
his
stage
fright
the
captain
grinned
when
he
saw
solomon
bangs
his
crackling
with
importance
introduced
the
congressman
the
latter
address
was
so
the
item
said
a
triumph
of
oratorical
it
really
was
a
good
speech
and
when
it
touched
upon
the
simple
sacrifice
of
the
men
who
had
given
up
their
lives
in
the
course
of
what
to
them
was
everyday
work
there
were
stifled
sobs
all
through
the
hall
luther
davis
during
this
portion
of
the
address
sat
with
his
big
hand
shading
his
eyes
later
on
when
the
speaker
was
sounding
the
praises
of
the
man
who
alone
forgetful
of
himself
braved
the
sea
and
the
storm
to
save
his
friends
those
who
looked
at
captain
eri
saw
his
chair
hitched
back
inch
by
inch
until
as
the
final
outburst
came
little
more
than
his
sunday
shoes
was
in
sight
he
had
retired
chair
and
all
to
the
wings
but
they
called
him
to
the
platform
again
and
amid
we
quote
from
the
item
once
more
a
hurricane
of
applause
the
two
heroes
were
adorned
with
the
watches
and
the
medals
there
was
a
sort
of
impromptu
reception
after
the
ceremony
when
captain
eri
with
mrs
snow
on
his
arm
struggled
through
the
crowd
toward
the
door
was
great
shipmate
and
you
deserved
it
declared
magnanimous
captain
jerry
wringing
his
hand
what
you
ought
to
have
eri
said
captain
perez
i
have
said
much
to
thank
you
for
savin
luther
whispered
miss
patience
but
i
hope
you
know
that
we
both
appreciate
what
you
done
and
never
forgit
ralph
and
elsie
also
shook
hands
with
him
and
said
some
pleasant
things
so
did
many
others
palmer
among
the
number
altogether
the
journey
through
the
hall
was
a
sort
of
triumphal
progress
whew
gasped
the
captain
as
they
came
out
into
the
clear
air
and
the
moonlight
let
hope
that
the
last
of
the
eri
whispered
mrs
snow
i
so
proud
of
you
i
do
know
what
to
and
that
remark
was
sweeter
to
the
captain
ears
than
all
those
that
had
preceded
it
they
turned
into
the
shore
road
and
were
alone
it
was
a
clear
winter
night
fresh
white
snow
on
the
ground
not
a
breath
of
wind
and
the
full
moon
painting
land
and
sea
dark
blue
and
silver
white
the
surf
sounded
faint
and
far
off
somewhere
in
the
distance
a
dog
was
barking
and
through
the
stillness
came
an
occasional
laugh
or
shout
from
the
people
going
home
from
the
hall
lots
of
things
can
happen
in
a
few
months
ca
they
said
mrs
snow
glancing
at
the
black
shadow
of
the
shuttered
baxter
homestead
they
can
so
replied
the
captain
think
what
happened
sence
last
september
i
did
know
you
then
and
now
it
seems
if
i
always
known
you
john
was
alive
then
and
elsie
nor
ralph
had
come
perez
had
met
pashy
neither
my
my
everybody
choosed
partners
but
jerry
he
chuckled
and
jerry
looked
the
most
likely
candidate
at
the
beginnin
i
glad
he
added
that
ralph
made
up
his
mind
to
stay
here
we
sha
lose
him
nor
elsie
for
a
few
years
they
paused
at
the
knoll
by
the
gate
fair
day
observed
the
captain
looking
up
at
the
sky
i
hope
it
be
fair
weather
for
us
the
rest
of
our
days
said
mrs
snow
you
had
it
rough
enough
that
sure
well
i
hope
you
have
a
smooth
the
lady
from
nantucket
looked
up
into
his
face
with
a
happy
laugh
i
guess
i
shall
she
said
i
know
i
got
a
good
pilot
