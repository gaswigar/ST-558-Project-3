propose

they
set

that
those

whose

lit
i
do
not
praise
their
choice
of
the
particular
type
in
so
far
as
in
the
first
place
i
maintain
it
is
only
just
that
the
poorer
classes
and
the
people
of
athens
should
be
better
off
than
the
men
of
birth
and
wealth
seeing
that
it
is
the
people
who
man
the
fleet
and
put
round
the
city
her
girdle
of
power
the
steersman
the
boatswain
the
lieutenant
the
at
the
prow
the
shipright
these
are
the
people
who
engird
the
city
with
power
far
rather
than
her
heavy
infantry
and
men
of
birth
of
quality
this
being
the
case
it
seems
only
just
that
offices
of
state
should
be
thrown
open
to
every
one
both
in
the
ballot
and
the
show
of
hands
and
that
the
right
of
speech
should
belong
to
any
one
who
likes
without
restriction
for
observe
there
are
many
of
these
offices
which
according
as
they
are
in
good
or
in
bad
hands
are
a
source
of
safety
or
of
danger
to
the
people
and
in
these
the
people
prudently
abstains
from
sharing
as
for
instance
it
does
not
think
it
incumbent
on
itself
to
share
in
the
functions
of
the
general
or
of
the
commander
of
cavalry
the
sovereign
people
recognises
the
fact
that
in
forgoing
the
personal
exercise
of
these
offices
and
leaving
them
to
the
control
of
the
more
powerful
citizens
it
secures
the
balance
of
advantage
to
itself
it
is
only
those
departments
of
government
which
bring
emolument
and
assist
the
private
estate
that
the

cares
to
keep
in
its

to

so
far
from
being
a
matter
of
surprise
this
as
can
be

is
the
keystone
of
the
preservation
of
the
democracy
it
is
these
poor
people
this
common
folk
this
whose
prosperity
combined
with
the
growth
of
their
numbers
enhances
the
democracy
whereas
a
shifting
of
fortune
to
the
advantage
of
the
wealthy
and
the
better
classes
implies
the
establishment
on
the
part
of
the
commonalty
of
a
strong
power
in
opposition
to
itself
in
fact
all
the
world
over
the
cream
of
society
is
in
opposition
to
the
democracy
naturally
since
the
smallest
amount
of
intemperance
and
injustice
together
with
the
highest
scrupulousness
in
the
pursuit
of
excellence
is
to
be
found
in
the
ranks
of
the
better
class
while
within
the
ranks
of
the
people
will
be
found
the
greatest
amount
of
ignorance
disorderliness
rascality
poverty
acting
as
a
stronger
incentive
to
base
conduct
not
to
speak
of
lack
of
education
and
ignorance
traceable
to
the
lack
of
means
which
afflicts
the
average
of
mankind
or
these
inferiors
these
or
some
of
these
folk
the
passage
is
corrupt
the
objection
may
be
raised
that
it
was
a
mistake
to
allow
the
universal
right
of
speech
and
a
seat
in
council
these
should
have
been
reserved
for
the
cleverest
the
flower
of
the
community
but
here
again
it
will
be
found
that
they
are
acting
with
wise
deliberation
in
granting
to
even
the
baser
sort
the
right
of
speech
for
supposing
only
the
better
people
might
speak
or
sit
in
council
blessings
would
fall
to
the
lot
of
those
like
themselves
but
to
the
commonalty
the
reverse
of
blessings
whereas
now
any
one
who
likes
any
base
fellow
may
get
up
and
discover
something
to
the
advantage
of
himself
and
his
equals
it
may
be
retorted
and
what
sort
of
advantage
either
for
himself
or
for
the
people
can
such
a
fellow
be
expected
to
hit
upon
the
answer
to
which
is
that
in
their
judgment
the
ignorance
and
baseness
of
this
fellow
together
with
his
goodwill
are
worth
a
great
deal
more
to
them
than
your
superior
person
virtue
and
wisdom
coupled
with
animosity
what
it
comes
to
therefore
is
that
a
state
founded
upon
such
institutions
will
not
be
the
best
state
but
given
a
democracy
these
are
the
right
means
to
procure
its
preservation
the
people
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
does
not
demand
that
the
city
should
be
well
governed
and
itself
a
slave
it
desires
to
be
free
and
to
be
master
as
to
bad
legislation
it
does
not
concern
itself
about
that
in
fact
what
you
believe
to
be
bad
legislation
is
the
very
source
of
the
people
strength
and
freedom
but
if
you
seek
for
good
legislation
in
the
first
place
you
will
see
the
cleverest
members
of
the
community
laying
down
the
laws
for
the
rest
and
in
the
next
place
the
better
class
will
curb
and
chastise
the
lower
orders
the
better
class
will
deliberate
in
behalf
of
the
state
and
not
suffer
fellows
to
sit
in
council
or
to
speak
or
vote
in
parliament
no
doubt
but
under
the
weight
of
such
blessings
the
people
will
in
a
very
short
time
be
reduced
to
slavery
lit
everybody
to
speak
in
turn
or
it
is
a
counsel
of
perfection
on
their
part
to
grant
to
etc
or
the
ideal
state
or
and
to
govern
and
hold
office
or
it
will
take
the
risk
of
that
see
grote
note
another
point
is
the
extraordinary
amount
of
license
granted
to
slaves
and
resident
aliens
at
athens
where
a
blow
is
illegal
and
a
slave
will
not
step
aside
to
let
you
pass
him
in
the
street
i
will
explain
the
reason
of
this
peculiar
custom
supposing
it
were
legal
for
a
slave
to
be
beaten
by
a
free
citizen
or
for
a
resident
alien
or
freedman
to
be
beaten
by
a
citizen
it
would
frequently
happen
that
an
athenian
might
be
mistaken
for
a
slave
or
an
alien
and
receive
a
beating
since
the
athenian
people
is
no
better
clothed
than
the
slave
or
alien
nor
in
personal
appearance
is
there
any
superiority
or
if
the
fact
itself
that
slaves
in
athens
are
allowed
to
indulge
in
luxury
and
indeed
in
some
cases
to
live
magnificently
be
found
astonishing
this
too
it
can
be
shown
is
done
of
set
purpose
where
you
have
a
naval
power
dependent
upon
wealth
we
must
perforce
be
slaves
to
our
slaves
in
order
that
we
may
get
in
our
and
let
the
real
slave
go
free
where
you
have
wealthy
slaves
it
ceases
to
be
advantageous
that
my
slave
should
stand
in
awe
of
you
in
lacedaemon
my
slave
stands
in
awe
of
you
but
if
your
slave
is
in
awe
of
me
there
will
be
a
risk
of
his
giving
away
his
own
moneys
to
avoid
running
a
risk
in
his
own
person
it
is
for
this
reason
then
that
we
have
established
an
equality
between
our
slaves
and
free
men
and
again
between
our
resident
aliens
and
full
citizens
because
the
city
stands
in
need
of
her
resident
aliens
to
meet
the
requirements
of
such
a
multiplicity
of
arts
and
for
the
purposes
of
her
navy
that

this
is
done
on

principle
that

that
if

that
it

to
the
interest

element
in

it
may
be
urged
that
if

strength

power
the
real
strength
of
athens
lies
in
the
capacity
of
her
allies
to
contribute
their
money
quota
but
to
the
democratic
mind
it
appears
a
higher
advantage
still
for
the
individual
athenian
to
get
hold
of
the
wealth
of
the

or
to
a
thorough
democrat
again
it
is
looked
upon
as
a
mistaken
policy
on
the
part
of
the
athenian
democracy
to
compel
her
allies
to
voyage
to
athens
in
order
to
have
their
cases
tried
on
the
other
hand
it
is
easy
to
reckon
up
what
a
number
of
advantages
the
athenian
people
derive
from
the
practice
impugned
in
the
first
place
there
is
the
steady
receipt
of
salaries
throughout
the
year
derived
from
the
court
fees
next
it
enables
them
to
manage
the
affairs
of
the
allied
states
while
seated
at
home
without
the
expense
of
naval
expeditions
thirdly
they
thus
preserve
the
partisans
of
the
democracy
and
ruin
her
opponents
in
the
law
courts
whereas
supposing
the
several
allied
states
tried
their
cases
at
home
being
inspired
by
hostility
to
athens
they
would
destroy
those
of
their
own
citizens
whose
friendship
to
the
athenian
people
was
most
marked
but
besides
all
this
the
democracy
derives
the
following
advantages
from
hearing
the
cases
of
her
allies
in
athens
in
the
first
place
the
one
per
cent
levied
in

is
increased
to
the

must

the

of

by

have
it
open
to
them
to
form
contingents
from
several
small
states
and
to
muster
in
force
for
battle
but
with
the
subjects
of
a
naval
power
it
is
different
as
far
as
they
are
groups
of
islanders
it
is
impossible
for
their
states
to
meet
together
for
united
action
for
the
sea
lies
between
them
and
the
dominant
power
is
master
of
the
sea
and
even
if
it
were
possible
for
them
to
assemble
in
some
single
island
unobserved
they
would
only
do
so
to
perish
by

and
as
to
the
states
subject
to
athens
which
are
not
islanders
but
situated
on
the
continent
the
larger
are
held
in
check
by
need
and
the
small
ones
absolutely
by
fear
since
there
is
no
state
in
existence
which
does
not
depend
upon
imports
and
exports
and
these
she
will
forfeit
if
she
does
not
lend
a
willing
ear
to
those
who
are
masters
by
sea
in
the
next
place
a
power
dominant
by
sea
can
do
certain
things
which
a
land
power
is
debarred
from
doing
as
for
instance
ravage
the
territory
of
a
superior
since
it
is
always
possible
to
coast
along
to
some
point
where
either
there
is
no
hostile
force
to
deal
with
or
merely
a
small
body
and
in
case
of
an
advance
in
force
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
they
can
take
to
their
ships
and
sail
away
such
a
performance
is
attended
with
less
difficulty
than
that
experienced
by
the
relieving
force
on
land
again
it
is
open
to
a
power
so
dominating
by
sea
to
leave
its
own
territory
and
sail
off
on
as
long
a
voyage
as
you
please
whereas
the
land
power
can
not
place
more
than
a
few
days
journey
between
itself
and
its
own
territory
for
marches
are
slow
affairs
and
it
is
not
possible
for
an
army
on
the
march
to
have
food
supplies
to
last
for
any
great
length
of
time
such
an
army
must
either
march
through
friendly
territory
or
it
must
force
a
way
by
victory
in

the
voyager
meanwhile
has
it
in
his

disembark
at
any
point
where
he
finds
himself
in

force
or
at

worst

which
the

as
to

the
athenians
are
exceptionally
placed
with
regard
to
hellenic
and
foreign
communities
alike
in
their
ability
to
hold
it
for
given
that
some
state
or
other
is
rich
in
timber
for
shipbuilding
where
is
it
to
find
a
market
for
the
product
except
by
persuading
the
ruler
of
the
sea
or
suppose
the
wealth
of
some
state
or
other
to
consist
of
iron
or
may
be
of
bronze
or
of
linen
yarn
where
will
it
find
a
market
except
by

of

maritime
power
yet
these
are
the
very
things
you

which

from

from

from

etc
besides
which
they
will

or
they
will
cease

i
without
one
stroke

extract

all
these
good
things
thanks
to
my

on

whilst
not
a

state
possesses
the
two
of
them
not

and
yarn
together
the

but
where
yarn
is
abundant
the
soil
will
be
light
and
devoid

and
in

way
bronze

will
not
be

so
for

there
is
just
one
thing
which
the
athenians
lack
supposing
that
they
were
the
inhabitants
of
an
island
and
were
still
as
now
rulers
of
the

they
would
have
had
it
in
their

to
work
whatever
mischief
they
liked
and
to
suffer
no
evil
in

as
long
as
they
kept

of
the
sea
neither
the
ravaging
of
their
territory
nor
the
expectation
of
an
enemy
approach
whereas
at
present
the
farming
portion
of
the
community
and
the
wealthy
landowners
are
ready
to
cringe
before
the
enemy
overmuch
whilst
the
people
knowing
full
well
that
come
what
may
not
one
stock
or
stone
of
their
property
will
suffer
nothing
will
be
cut
down
nothing
burnt
lives
in
freedom
from
alarm
without
fawning
at
the
enemy
approach
besides
this
there
is
another
fear
from
which
they
would
have
been
exempt
in
an
island
home
the
apprehension
of
the
city
being
at
any
time
betrayed
by
their
oligarchs
and
the
gates
thrown
open
and
an
enemy
bursting
suddenly
in
how
could
incidents
like
these
have
taken
place
if
an
island
had
been
their
home
again
had
they
inhabited
an
island
there
would
have
been
no
stirring
of
sedition
against
the
people
whereas
at
present
in
the
event
of
faction
those
who
set
it
in
foot
base
their
hopes
of
success
on
the
introduction
of
an
enemy
by
land
but
a
people
inhabiting
an
island
would
be
free
from
all
anxiety
on
that
score
since
however
they
did
not
chance
to
inhabit
an
island
from
the
first
what
they
now
do
is
this
they
deposit
their
property
in
the
islands
trusting
to
their
command
of
the
sea
and
they
suffer
the
soil
of
aticca
to
be
ravaged
without
a
sigh
to
expend
pity
on
that
they

have
brought
it
on
themselves
by
excessive
love
of
meddling
or
some
covetous
at
the
expense
of

that
no
particular

is
felt
at

it
would
not

or
the

of

what
then
i
venture
to
assert
is
that
the
people
of
athens
has
no
difficulty
in
recognising
which
of
its
citizens
are
of
the
better
sort
and
which
the
opposite
and
so
recognising
those
who
are
serviceable
and
advantageous
to
itself
even
though
they
be
base
the
people
loves
them
but
the
good
folk
they
are
disposed
rather
to
hate
this
virtue
of
theirs
the
people
holds
is
not
engrained
in
their
nature
for
any
good
to
itself
but
rather
for
its
injury
in
direct
opposition
to
this
there
are
some
persons
who
being
born
of
the
people
are
yet
by
natural
instinct
not
commoners
for
my
part
i
pardon
the
people
its
own
democracy
as
indeed
it
is
pardonable
in
any
one
to
do
good
to
himself
but
the
man
who
not
being
himself
one
of
the
people
prefers
to
live
in
a
state
democratically
governed
rather
than
in
an
oligarchical
state
may
be
said
to
smooth
his
own
path
towards
iniquity
he
knows
that
a
bad
man
has
a
better
chance
of
slipping
through
the
fingers
of
justice
in
a
democratic
than
in
an
oligarchical
state
or
and
which
are
good
for
nothing
or
its
own
friends
and
supporters
reading

iii
i
repeat
that
my
position
concerning
the
polity
of
the
athenians
is
this
the
type
of
polity
is
not
to
my
taste
but
given
that
a
democratic
form
of
government
has
been
agreed
upon
they
do
seem
to
me
to
go
the
right
way
to
preserve
the
democracy
by
the
adoption
of
the
particular
type
which
i
have
set
forth
or
manner
or
manner
but
there
are
other
objections
brought
as
i
am
aware
against
the
athenians
by
certain
people
and
to
this
effect
it
not
seldom
happens
they
tell
us
that
a
man
is
unable
to
transact
a
piece
of
business
with
the
senate
or
the
people
even
if
he
sit
waiting
a
whole
year
now
this
does
happen
at
athens
and
for
no
other
reason
save
that
owing
to
the
immense
mass
of
affairs
they
are
unable
to
work
off
all
the
business
on
hand
and
dismiss
the
applicants
and
how
in
the
world
should
they
be
able
considering
in
the
first
place
that
they
the
athenians
have
more
festivals
to
celebrate
than
any
other
state
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
hellas
during
these
festivals
of
course
the
transaction
of
any
sort
of
affairs
of
state
is
still
more
out
of
the
question
in
the
next
place
only
consider
the
number
of
cases
they
have
to
decide
what
with
private
suits
and
public
causes
and
scrutinies
of
accounts
more
than
the
whole
of
the
rest
of
mankind
put
together
while
the
senate
has
multifarious
points
to
advise
upon
concerning
peace
and
war
concerning
ways
and
means
concerning
the
framing
and
passing
of
laws
and
concerning
the
thousand
and
one
matters
affecting
the
state
perpetually
occurring
and
endless
questions
touching
the
allies
besides
the
receipt
of
the
tribute
the
superintendence
of
dockyards
and
temples
etc
can
i
ask
again
any
one
find
it
at
all
surprising
that
with
all
these
affairs
on
their
hands
they
are
unequal
to
doing

he
will

for
my
part
i
am
free
to
confess
to
these
gainsayers
that
a
good
many
things
may
be
done
at
athens
by

of

i
will
add
that
a
good
many
more
still
might
be
done
if
the

so
as
to
get
a
far
less
just
judgment
but
besides
this
we
can
not
escape
the
conclusion
that
the
athenians
have
their
festivals
to
keep
during
which
the
courts
can
not
sit
as
a
matter
of
fact
these
festivals
are
twice
as
numerous
as
those
of
any
other
people
but
i
will
reckon
them
as
merely
equal
to
those
of
the
state
which
has
the
fewest
lit
it
is
not
possible
to
give
judgment
or
for
juries

sit
this
being
so
i
maintain
that
it
is
not
possible
for
business
affairs
at
athens
to
stand
on
any
very
different
footing
from
the
present
except
to
some
slight
extent
by
adding
here
and
deducting
there
any
large
modification
is
out
of
the
question
short
of
damaging
the
democracy
itself
no
doubt
many
expedients
might
be
discovered
for
improving
the
constitution
but
if
the
problem
be
to
discover
some
adequate
means
of
improving
the
constitution
while
at
the
same
time
the
democracy
is
to
remain
intact
i
say
it
is
not
easy
to
do
this
except
as
i
have
just
stated
to
the
extent
of
some
trifling
addition
here
or
deduction
there
there
is
another
point
in
which
it
is
sometimes
felt
that
the
athenians
are
ill
advised
in
their
adoption
namely
of
the
less
respectable
party
in
a
state
divided
by
faction
but
if
so
they
do
it
advisedly
if
they
chose
the
more
respectable
they
would
be
adopting
those
whose
views
and
interests
differ
from
their
own
for
there
is
no
state
in
which
the
best
element
is
friendly
to
the
people
it
is
the
worst
element
which
in
every
state
favours
the
democracy
on
the
principle
that
like
favours
like
it
is
simple
enough
then
the
athenians
choose
what
is
most
akin
to
themselves
also
on
every
occasion
on
which
they
have
attempted
to
side
with
the
better
classes
it
has
not
fared
well
with
them
but
within
a
short
interval
the
democratic
party
has
been
enslaved
as
for
instance
in
boeotia
or
as
when
they
chose
the
aristocrats
of
the
milesians
and
within
a
short
time
these
revolted
and
cut
the
people
to
pieces
or
as
when
they
chose
the
lacedaemonians
as
against
the
messenians
and
within
a
short
time
the
lacedaemonians
subjugated
the
messenians
and
went
to
war
against
athens
birds

the
references
are

i
seem
to
overhear
a
retort
no
one
of
course
is
deprived
of
his
civil
rights
at
athens
unjustly
my
answer
is
that
there
are
some
who
are
unjustly
deprived
of
their
civil
rights
though
the
cases
are
certainly
rare
but
it
will
take
more
than
a
few
to
attack
the
democracy
at
athens
since
you
may
take
it
as
an
established
fact
it
is
not
the
man
who
has
lost
his
civil
rights
justly
that
takes
the
matter
to
heart
but
the
victims
if
any
of
injustice
but
how
in
the
world
can
any
one
imagine
that
many
are
in
a
state
of
civil
disability
at
athens
where
the
people
and
the
holders
of
office
are
one
and
the
same
it
is
from
iniquitous
exercise
of
office
from
iniquity
exhibited
either
in
speech
or
action
and
the
like
circumstances
that
citizens
are
punished
with
deprivation
of
civil
rights
in
athens
due
reflection
on
these
matters
will
serve
to
dispel
the
notion
that
there
is
any
danger
at
athens
from
persons
visited
with
disenfranchisement
the
polity
of
the
lacedaemonians
i
i
recall
the
astonishment
with
which
i
first
noted
the
unique
position
of
sparta
amongst
the
states
of
hellas
the
relatively
sparse
population
and
at
the
same
time
the
extraordinary
power
and
prestige
of
the
community
i
was
puzzled
to
account
for
the
fact
it
was
only
when
i
came
to
consider
the
peculiar
institutions
of
the
spartans
that
my
wonderment
ceased
or
rather
it
is
transferred
to
the
legislator
who
gave
them
those
laws
obedience
to
which
has
been
the
secret
of
their
prosperity
this
legislator
lycurgus
i
must
needs
admire
and
hold
him
to
have
been
one
of
the
wisest
of
mankind
certainly
he
was
no
servile
imitator
of
other
states
it
was
by
a
stroke
of
invention
rather
and
on
a
pattern
much
in
opposition
to
the
one
that
he
brought
his
fatherland

of

how
are

to

produce

or
such
technical

is
for
the
most
part
sedentary
lycurgus
pursued
a
different
path
clothes
were
things
he
held
the
furnishing
of
which
might
well
enough
be
left
to
female
slaves
and
believing
that
the
highest
function
of
a
free
woman
was
the
bearing
of
children
in
the
first
place
he
insisted
on
the
training
of
the
body
as
incumbent
no
less
on
the
female
than
the
male
and
in
pursuit
of
the
same
idea
instituted
rival
contests
in
running
and
feats
of
strength
for
women
as
for
men
his
belief
was
that
where
both
parents
were
strong
their
progeny
would
be
found
to
be
more
vigorous
and
so
again
after
marriage
in
view
of
the
fact
that
immoderate
intercourse
is
elsewhere
permitted
during
the
earlier
period
of
matrimony
he
adopted
a
principle
directly
opposite
he
laid
it
down
as
an
ordinance
that
a
man
should
be
ashamed
to
be
seen
visiting
the
chamber
of
his
wife
whether
going
in
or
coming
out
when
they
did
meet
under
such
restraint
the
mutual
longing
of
these
lovers
could
not
but
be
increased
and
the
fruit
which
might
spring
from
such
intercourse
would
tend
to
be
more
robust
than
theirs
whose
affections
are
cloyed
by
satiety
by
a
farther
step
in
the
same
direction
he
refused
to
allow
marriages
to
be
contracted
at
any
period
of
life
according
to
the
fancy
of
the
parties
concerned
marriage
as
he
ordained
it
must
only
take
place
in
the
prime
of
bodily
vigour
this
too
being
as
he
believed
a
condition
conducive
to
the
production
of
healthy
offspring
or
again
to
meet
the
case
which
might
occur
of
an
old
man
wedded
to
a
young
wife
considering
the
jealous
watch
which
such
husbands
are
apt
to
keep
over
their
wives
he
introduced
a
directly
opposite
custom
that
is
to
say
he
made
it
incumbent
on
the
aged
husband
to
introduce
some
one
whose
qualities

i
wish
now
to
explain
the
systems
of
education
in
fashion
here
and
elsewhere
throughout
the
rest
of
hellas
the
custom
on
the
part
of
those
who
claim
to
educate
their
sons
in
the
best
way
is
as
follows
as
soon
as
the
children
are
of
an
age
to
understand
what
is
said
to
them
they
are
immediately
placed
under
the
charge
of
paidagogoi
or
tutors
who
are
also
attendants
and
sent
off
to
the
school
of
some
teacher
to
be
taught
grammar
music
and
the
concerns
of
the
palestra
besides
this
they
are
given
shoes
to
wear
which
tend
to
make
their
feet
tender
and
their
bodies
are
enervated
by
various
changes
of
clothing
and
as
for
food
the
only
measure
recognised
is
that
which
is
fixed
by
appetite

but
when
we
turn
to
lycurgus
instead
of
leaving
it
to
each
member
of
the
state
privately
to
appoint
a
slave
to
be
his
son
tutor
he
set
over
the
young
spartans
a
public
guardian
the
paidonomos
or
pastor
to
give
them
his
proper
title
with
complete
authority
over
them
this
guardian
was
selected
from
those
who
filled
the
highest
magistracies
he
had
authority
to
hold
musters
of
the
boys
and
as
their
overseer
in
case
of
any
misbehaviour
to
chastise
severely
the
legislator
further
provided
his
pastor
with
a
body
of
youths
in
the
prime
of
life
and
bearing
whips
to
inflict
punishment
when
necessary
with
this
happy
result
that
in
sparta
modesty
and
obedience
ever
go
hand
in
hand
nor
is
there
lack
of
either

or

the
boys
in

instead
of
softening
their

his
rule
was
to
make
them
hardy
through
going
barefoot
this
habit
if
practised
would
as
he
believed
enable
them
to
scale

more

cf

instead
of
making
them
effeminate
with
a
variety
of
clothes
his
rule
was
to
habituate
them
to
a
single
garment
the
whole
year
through
thinking
that
so
they
would
be
better
prepared
to

avoid

heaviness
which
is
engendered
by
repletion
and
yet
not
to
remain
altogether
unacquainted
with
the
pains
of
penurious
living
his
belief
was
that
by
such
training
in
boyhood
they
would
be
better
able
when
occasion
demanded
to
continue
toiling
on
an
empty
stomach
they
would
be
all
the
fitter
if
the
word
of
command
were
given
to
remain
on
the
stretch
for
a
long
time
without
extra
dieting
the
craving
for

would
be

readiness
to
take
any
victual
set

them

in

regime
would
be
found
more

though

it
is
obvious
i
say
that
the
whole
of
this
education
tended
and
was
intended
to
make
the
boys
craftier
and
more
inventive
in
getting
in
supplies
whilst
at
the
same
time
it
cultivated
their
warlike
instincts
an
objector
may
retort
but
if
he
thought
it
so
fine
a
feat
to
steal
why
did
he
inflict
all
those
blows
on
the
unfortunate
who
was
caught
my
answer
is
for
the
reason
which
induces
people
in
other
matters
which
are
taught
to
punish
the
of
a
service
so
they
the
lacedaemonians
visit
penalties
on
the
boy
who
is
detected
thieving
as
being
but
a
sorry
bungler
in
the
art
so
to
steal
as
many
cheeses
as
possible
off
the
shrine
of
orthia
was
a
feat
to
be
encouraged
but
at
the
same
moment
others
were
enjoined
to
scourge
the
thief
which
would
point
a
moral
not
obscurely
that
by
pain
endured
for
a
brief
season
a
man
may
earn
the
joyous
reward
of
lasting
glory
herein
too
it
is
plainly
shown
that
where
speed
is
requisite
the
sluggard
will
win
for
himself
much
trouble

furthermore
and
in
order
that
the
boys
should
not
want
a
ruler
even
in
case
the
pastor
himself
were
absent
he
gave
to
any
citizen
who
chanced
to
be

authority
to
lay
upon
them
injunctions
for
their
good
and
to
chastise
them
for
any
trespass
committed
by
so
doing
he
created
in
the
boys

a
most
rare
modesty
and
reverence
and
indeed
there
is
nothing
which
whether
as
boys
or
men
they
respect
more
highly
than
the

intention
that
the

must
never
be
reft
of
a

even
if
by

there
were

of

was
to
become

we
know
that
the
rest
of
the
hellenes
deal
with
this
relationship
in
different
ways
either
after
the
manner
of
the
boeotians
where
man
and
boy
are
intimately
united
by
a
bond
like
that
of
wedlock
or
after
the
manner
of
the
eleians
where
the
fruition
of
beauty
is
an
act
of
grace
whilst
there
are
others
who
would
absolutely
debar
the
lover
from
all

the

see

ii
iv
lycurgus
adopted
a
system
opposed
to
all
of
these
alike
given
that
some
one
himself
being
all
that
a
man
ought
to
be
should
in
admiration
of
a
boy
soul
endeavour
to
discover
in
him
a
true
friend
without
reproach
and
to
consort
with
him
this
was
a
relationship
which
lycurgus
commended
and
indeed
regarded
as
the
noblest
type
of
bringing
up
but
if
as
was
evident
it
was
not
an
attachment
to
the
soul
but
a
yearning
merely
towards
the
body
he
stamped
this
thing
as
foul
and
horrible
and
with
this
result
to
the
credit
of
lycurgus
be
it
said
that
in
lacedaemon
the
relationship
of
lover
and
beloved
is
like
that
of
parent
and
child
or
brother

where
carnal
appetite
is

see

plut

that
this
however
which
is
the
fact
should
be
scarcely
credited
in
some
quarters
does
not
surprise
me
seeing
that
in
many
states
the
laws
do
not
oppose
the
desires
in
question
law
and
custom
i
have
now
described
the
two
chief
methods
of
education
in
vogue
that
is
to
say
the
lacedaemonian
as
contrasted
with
that
of
the
rest
of
hellas
and
i
leave
it
to
the
judgment
of
him
whom
it
may
concern
which
of
the
two
has
produced
the
finer
type
of
men
and
by
finer
i
mean
the
better
disciplined
the
more
modest
and
reverential
and
in
matters
where
is
a
virtue
the
more
continent
iii
coming
to
the
critical
period
at
which
a
boy
ceases
to
be
a
boy
and
becomes
a
youth
we
find
that
it
is
just
then
that
the
rest
of
the
world
proceed
to
emancipate
their
children
from
the
private
tutor
and
the
schoolmaster
and
without
substituting
any
further
ruler
are
content
to
launch
them
into
absolute
independence
eis
to
meirakiousthai
with
reference
to

erases
the
phrase
as
here
again
lycurgus
took
an
entirely
opposite
view
of
the
matter
this
if
observation
might
be
trusted
was
the
season
when
the
tide
of
animal
spirits
flows
fast
and
the
froth
of
insolence
rises
to
the
surface
when
too
the
most
violent
appetites
for
divers
pleasures
in
serried
ranks
invade
the
mind
this
then
was
the
right
moment
at
which
to
impose
tenfold
labours
upon
the
growing
youth
and
to
devise
for
him
a
subtle
system
of
absorbing
occupation
and
by
a
crowning
enactment
which
said
that
he
who
shrank
from
the
duties
imposed
on
him
would
forfeit
henceforth
all
claim
to
the
glorious
honours
of
the
state
he
caused
not
only
the
public
authorities
but
those
personally
interested
in
the
several
companies
of
youths
to
take
serious
pains
so
that
no
single
individual
of
them
should
by
an
act
of
craven
cowardice
find
himself
utterly
rejected

reprobate

furthermore
in
his
desire
to
implant
in
their
youthful
souls
a
root
of
modesty
he
imposed
upon
these
bigger
boys
a
special
rule
in
the
very
streets
they
were
to
keep
their
two
hands
within
the
folds
of

they
were
to
walk

without
turning
their

now
there
but
rather
to
keep
their
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ground
before
them
and
hereby
it
would
seem
to
be
proved
conclusively
that
even
in
the
matter
of
quiet
bearing
and
sobriety
the
masculine
type
may
claim
greater
strength
than
that
which
we
attribute
to
the
nature

selects
one

others
being
bound
to
explain
for
what
reason
he
prefers

these

disapproves
of

is
that
those
who
fail

are
now
at
open

not

with
those
who
rejected
them

with
those
who
were

they
keep
ever
a

another

detect
some
slip
of
conduct
contrary
to
the
high
code
of

there

so

set
on

that

for

at

the

is
removed

continues

lycurgus
made
it
customary
for
that

of

citizens
to
regard
hunting
as
the
highest
honour
suited
to
their
age
albeit
not
to
the
exclusion
of

that

describe
the

of
living
which
he
established
for
the
whole

irrespective

it
will
be
understood
that
when
lycurgus
first
came
to
deal
with
the

the
spartans
like
the
rest
of
the
hellenes
used
to
mess
privately
at
home
tracing
more
than
half
the
current
misdemeanours
to
this
custom
he
was
determined
to
drag
his
people
out
of
holes
and
corners
into
the
broad
daylight
and
so
he
invented
the
public
whereby
he
expected
at

this

be

in

that

such
an
atmosphere
is
little

this
observation
i

was
not
wasted
on
him
on

turning
it
over
in
his

that
any

judgment

devote
himself
to

may
hope
to

there
are
yet
other
customs
in
sparta
which
lycurgus
instituted
in
opposition
to
those
of
the
rest
of
hellas
and
the
following
among
them
we
all
know
that
in
the
generality
of
states
every
one
devotes
his
full
energy
to
the
business
of
making
money
one
man
as
a
tiller
of
the
soil
another
as
a
mariner
a
third
as
a
merchant
whilst
others
depend
on
various
arts
to
earn
a
living
but
at
sparta
lycurgus
forbade
his
freeborn
citizens
to
have
anything
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
concerns
of
as
freemen
he
enjoined
upon
them
to
regard
as
their
concern
exclusively
those
activities
upon
which
the
foundations
of
civic
liberty
are
based
and
indeed
one
may
well
ask
for
what
reason
should
wealth
be
regarded
as
a
matter
for
serious
pursuit
in
a
community
where
partly
by
a
system
of
equal
contributions
to
the
necessaries
of
life
and
partly
by
the
maintenance
of
a
common
standard
of
living
the
lawgiver
placed
so
effectual
a
check
upon
the
desire
of
riches
for
the
sake
of
luxury
what
inducement
for
instance
would
there
be
to
make
money
even
for
the
sake
of
wearing
apparel
in
a
state
where
personal
adornment
is
held
to
lie
not
in
the
costliness
of
the
clothes
they
wear
but
in
the
healthy
condition
of
the
body
to
be
clothed
nor
again
could
there
be
much
inducement
to
amass
wealth
in
order
to
be
able
to
expend
it
on
the
members
of
a
common
mess
where
the
legislator
had
made
it
seem
far
more
glorious
that
a
man
should
help
his
fellows
by
the
labour
of
his
body
than
by
costly
outlay

being

he
went
a
step
further

set
up

barrier

in

as

against
the
pursuance
of
by

means

place

established

so
extraordinary
a
sort
that
even
a

of
ten
minas
could
not
come
into

house
without
attracting
the
notice
either
of
the
master
himself
or
of
some
member
of

occupy

repeat
the
question
asked
above
for
what
reason
should
become
an
earnest
pursuit
in
a

where
the
possession
of

entails
more

its

but
to
proceed
we
are
all
aware
that
there
is
no
state
in
the
world
in
which
greater
obedience
is
shown
to
magistrates
and
to
the
laws
themselves
than
sparta
but
for
my
part
i
am
disposed
to
think
that
lycurgus
could
never
have
attempted
to
establish
this
healthy
condition
until
he
had
first
secured
the
unanimity
of
the
most
powerful
members
of
the
state
i
infer
this
for
the
following
reasons
in
other
states
the
leaders
in
rank
and
influence
do
not
even
desire
to
be
thought
to
fear
the
magistrates
such
a
thing
they
would
regard
as
in
itself
a
symbol
of
servility
in
sparta
on
the
contrary
the
stronger
a
man
is
the
more
readily
does
he
bow
before
constituted
authority
and
indeed
they
magnify
themselves
on
their
humility
and
on
a
prompt
obedience
running
or
at
any
rate
not
crawling
with
laggard
step
at
the
word
of
command
such
an
example
of
eager
discipline
they
are
persuaded
set
by
themselves
will
not
fail
to
be
followed
by
the
rest
and
this
is
precisely
what
has
taken
place
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
that
it
was
these
same
noblest
members
of
the
state
who
combined
to
lay
the
foundation
of
the
ephorate
after
they
had
come
to
the
conclusion
themselves
that
of
all
the
blessings
which
a
state
or
an
army
or
a

can
enjoy
obedience
is
the
greatest
since
as
they
could
not
but
reason
the
greater
the
power
with
which
men
fence
about
authority
the
greater
the

it

exercise

but
of
all
the
many
beautiful
contrivances
invented
by
lycurgus
to
kindle
a
willing
obedience
to
the
laws
in
the
hearts
of
the
citizens
none
to
my
mind
was
happier
or
more
excellent
than
his
unwillingness
to
deliver
his
code
to
the
people
at
large
until
attended
by
the
most
powerful
members
of
the
state
he
had
betaken
himself
to
delphi
and
there
made
inquiry
of
the
god
whether
it
were
better
for
sparta
and
conducive
to
her
interests
to
obey
the
laws
which
he
had
framed
and
not
until
the
divine
answer
came
better
will
it
be
in
every
way
did
he
deliver
them
laying
it
down
as
a
last
ordinance
that
to
refuse
obedience
to
a
code
which
had
the
sanction
of
the
pythian
god
himself
was
a
thing
not
illegal
only

profane

ix
the
following
too
may
well
excite
our
admiration
for
lycurgus
i
speak
of
the
consummate
skill
with
which
he
induced
the
whole
state
of
sparta
to
regard
an
honourable
death
as
preferable
to
an
ignoble
life
and
indeed
if
any
one
will
investigate
the
matter
he
will
find
that
by
comparison
with
those
who
make
it
a
principle
to
retreat
in
face
of
danger
actually
fewer
of
these
spartans
die
in
battle
since
to
speak
truth
salvation
it
would
seem
attends
on
virtue
far
more
frequently
than
on
cowardice
virtue
which
is
at
once
easier
and
sweeter
richer
in
resource
and
stronger
of
arm
than
her
opposite
and
that
virtue
has
another
familiar
attendant
to
wit
glory
needs
no
showing
since
the
whole
world
would
fain
ally
themselves
after
some
sort
in
battle
with
the
good
see
homer
il
tyrtaeus
tressanton
d
andron
pas
apolol
arete
yet
the
actual
means
by
which
he
gave
currency
to
these
principles
is
a
point
which
it
were
well
not
to
overlook
it
is
clear
that
the
lawgiver
set
himself
deliberately
to
provide
all
the
blessings
of
heaven
for
the
good
man
and
a
sorry
and
existence
for
the
coward
in
other
states
the
man
who
shows
himself
base
and
cowardly
wins
to
himself
an
evil
reputation
and
the
nickname
of
a
coward
but
that
is
all
for
the
rest
he
buys
and
sells
in
the
same
as
the
good
man
he
sits
beside
him
at
play
he
exercises
with
him
in
the
same
gymnasium
and
all
as
suits
his
humour
but
at
lacedaemon
there
is
not
one
man
who
would
not
feel
ashamed
to
welcome
the
coward
at
the
common
or
to
try
conclusions
with
such
an
antagonist
in
a
wrestling
bout
consider
the
day
round
of
his
existence
the
sides
are
being
picked
up

but
he
is
left
out
as
the
odd
man
there
is
no
place
for
him
during
the
choric

he
is
driven
away
into

quarters
nay
in

it
is
he
who
must
step
aside
for

pass

being

he
must
rise

make
room
even
for
a
younger
man
at

he
will
have
his
maiden

to
support
in

and
they
will
hold
him
to
blame
for
their
unwedded
lives

with
no

to
bless
it
that
is
a
condition
he
must
face
and
yet
he
will
have
to
pay
damages
to
the
last
farthing
for
incurring
it
let
him
not
roam
abroad
with
a

countenance
let
him

is

superiors
such
being
the
weight
of
infamy
which
is
laid
upon
all
cowards
i
for
my
part
am
not
surprised
if
in
sparta
they
deem
death
preferable
to
a
life
so

in
dishonour

that
too
was
a
happy
enactment
in
my
opinion
by
which
lycurgus
provided
for
the
continual
cultivation
of
virtue
even
to
old
age
by
fixing
the
election
to
the
council
of
elders
as
a
last
ordeal
at
the
goal
of
life
he
made
it
impossible
for
a
high
standard
of
virtuous
living
to
be
disregarded
even
in
old
age
so
too
it
is
worthy
of
admiration
in
him
that
he
lent
his
helping
hand
to
virtuous
old
age
thus
by
making
the
elders
sole
arbiters
in
the
trial
for
life
he
contrived
to
charge
old
age
with
a
greater
weight
of
honour
than
that
which
is
accorded
to
the
strength
of
mature
manhood
and
assuredly
such
a
contest
as
this
must
appeal
to
the
zeal
of
mortal
man
beyond
all
others
in
a
supreme
degree
fair
doubtless
are
contests
of
gymnastic
skill
yet
are
they
but
trials
of
bodily
excellence
but
this
contest
for
the
seniority
is
of
a
higher
sort
it
is
an
ordeal
of
the
soul
itself
in
proportion
therefore
as
the
soul
is
worthier
than
the
body
so
must
these
contests
of
the
soul
appeal
to
a
stronger
enthusiasm
than
their
bodily
antitypes

or

of

yet
this
he
did
when
he
made
since
he
contrived
etc
and
yet
another
point
may
well
excite
our
admiration
for
lycurgus
largely
it
had
not
escaped
his
observation
that
communities
exist
where
those
who
are
willing
to
make
virtue
their
study
and
delight
fail
somehow
in
ability
to
add
to
the
glory
of
their
fatherland
that
lesson
the
legislator
laid
to
heart
and
in
sparta
he
enforced
as
a
matter
of
public
duty
the
practice
of
virtue
by
every
citizen
and
so
it
is
that
just
as
man
differs
from
man
in
some
excellence
according
as
he
cultivates
or
neglects
to
cultivate
it
this
city
of
sparta
with
good
reason
outshines
all
other
states
in
virtue
since
she
and
she
alone
as
made
the
attainment
of
a
high
standard
of
noble
living
a
public
duty
is
this
an
autobiographical
touch
and
was
this
not
a
noble
enactment
that
whereas
other
states
are
content
to
inflict
punishment
only
in
cases
where
a
man
does
wrong
against
his
neighbour
lycurgus
imposed
penalties
no
less
severe
on
him
who
openly
neglected
to
make
himself
as
good
as
possible
for
this
it
seems
was
his
principle
in
the
one
case
where
a
man
is
robbed
or
defrauded
or
kidnapped
and
made
a
slave
of
the
injury
of
the
misdeed
whatever
it
be
is
personal
to
the
individual
so
maltreated
but
in
the
other
case
whole
communities
suffer
foul
treason
at
the
hands
of
the
base
man
and
the
coward
so
that
it
was
only
reasonable
in
my
opinion
that
he
should
visit
the
heaviest
penalty
upon
these
latter
moreover
he
laid
upon
them
like
some
irresistible
necessity
the
obligation
to
cultivate
the
whole
virtue
of
a
citizen
provided
they
duly
performed
the
injunctions
of
the
law
the
city
belonged
to
them
each
and
all
in
absolute
possession
and
on
an
equal
footing
weakness
of
limb
or
want
of
wealth
was
no
drawback
in
his
eyes
but
as
for
him
who
out
of
the
cowardice
of
his
heart
shrank
from
the
painful
performance
of
the
law
injunction
the
finger
of
the
legislator
pointed
him
out
as
there
and
then
disqualified
to

regarded

it
may
be
added
that
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
the
great
antiquity
of
this
code
of
laws
the
point
is
clear
so
far
that
lycurgus
himself
is
said
to
have

in

being

these

are
stamped
in

the
most

thing
of
all
is
that
while

the

the

one

stepping

so
throughout
the
whole
length
of
the
column
until
the
line
is
formed
facing
the
enemy
or
supposing
while
in
this
position
an
enemy
appears
in
the
rear
each
file
performs
a
with
the
effect
of
bringing
the
best
men
face
to
face
with
the
enemy
all
along
the
line
as
to
the
point
that
the
leader
previously
on
the
right
finds
himself
now
on
the
left
they
do
not
consider
that
they
are
necessarily
losers
thereby
but
as
it
may
turn
out
even
gainers
if
for
instance
the
enemy
attempted
to
turn
their
flank
he
would
find
himself
wrapping
round
not
their
exposed
but
their
shielded
flank
or
if
for
any
reason
it
be
thought
advisable
for
the
general
to
keep
the
right
wing
they
turn
the
corps
about
and
by
ranks
until
the
leader
is
on

right
and
the
rear
rank
on
the
left
or
again
supposing
a
division
of
the
enemy
appears
on
the
right
whilst
they
are
marching
in
column
they
have
nothing
further
to
do
but
to
wheel
each
company
to
the
right
like
a
trireme
prow
forwards
to
meet
the
enemy
and
thus
the
rear
company
again
finds
itself
on
the
right
if
however
the
enemy
should
attack
on
the
left
either
they
will
not
allow
of
that
and
push
him
aside
or
else
they
wheel
their
companies
to
the
left
to
face
the
antagonist
and
thus
the
rear
company
once
more
falls
into

on

now
if
the
question
be
put
to
me
do
you
maintain
that
the
laws
of

remain
still
to
this
day
unchanged
that
indeed
is
an
assertion
which
i
should
no
longer
venture
to
maintain
knowing
as
i
do
that
in
former
times
the
lacedaemonians
preferred
to
live
at
home
on
moderate
means
content
to
associate
exclusively
with
themselves
rather
than
to
play
the
part
of
in
foreign
states
and
to
be
corrupted
by
flattery
knowing
further
as
i
do
that
formerly
they
dreaded
to
be
detected
in
the
possession
of
gold
whereas
nowadays
there
are
not
a
few
who
make
it
their
glory
and
their
boast
to
be
possessed
of
it
i
am
very
well
aware
that
in
former
days
alien
acts
were
put
in
force
for
this
very
object
to
live
abroad
was
not
allowed
and
why
simply
in
order
that
the
citizens
of
sparta
might
not
take
the
infection
of
dishonesty
and
from
foreigners
whereas
now
i
am
very
well
aware
that
those
who
are
reputed
to
be
leading
citizens
have
but
one
ambition
and
that
is
to
live
to
the
end
of
their
days
as
on
a
foreign
soil
the
days
were
when
their
sole
anxiety
was
to
fit
themselves
to
lead
the
rest
of
hellas
but
nowadays
they
concern
themselves
much
more
to
wield
command
than
to
be
fit
themselves
to
rule
and
so
it
has
come
to
pass
that
whereas
in
old
days
the
states
of
hellas
flocked
to
lacedaemon
seeking
her
leadership
against
the
supposed
wrongdoer
now
numbers
are
inviting
one
another
to
prevent
the
lacedaemonians
again
recovering
their
empire
yet
if
they
have
incurred
all
these
reproaches
we
need
not
wonder
seeing
that
they
are
so
plainly
disobedient
to
the
god
himself
and
to
the

of
their

he

him
choice

cities
enough
to
satisfy
moderate
needs
without
excess
of
wealth
and
in
order
that
the
kings
also
might
camp

mess
in

he
appointed
them
public

he
honoured
them
with
a
double
portion
each
at
the
evening
meal

that
they
might
actually
eat
twice
as
much
as

that

might
have
wherewithal
to
honour
whomsoever
he
desired

each
of
the
