its
many
glistening

which
passing
travellers
linger
to

stauffacher
the
house
is
strongly
built
and
handsomely
but
ah
the
ground
on
which
we
built
it
totters
gertrude
tell
me
dear
werner
what
you
mean
by
that
stauffacher
no
later
since
than
yesterday
i
sat
beneath
this
linden
thinking
with
delight
how
fairly
all
was
finished
when
from
kuessnacht
the
viceroy
and
his
men
came
riding
by
before
this
house
he
halted
in
surprise
at
once
i
rose
and
as
beseemed
his
rank
advanced
respectfully
to
greet
the
lord
to
whom
the
emperor
delegates
his
power
as
judge
supreme
within
our
canton
here
who
is
the
owner
of
this
house
he
asked
with
mischief
in
his
thoughts
for
well
he
knew
with
prompt
decision
thus
i
answered
him
the
emperor
your
grace
my
lord
and
yours
and
held
by
one
in
fief
on
this
he
answered
i
am
the
emperor
viceregent
here
and
will
not
that
each
peasant
churl
should
build
at
his
own
pleasure
bearing
him
as
freely
as
though
he
were
the
master
in
the
land
i
shall
make
bold
to
put
a
stop
to
this
so
saying
he
with
menaces
rode
off
and
left
me
musing
with
a
heavy
heart
on
the
fell
purpose
that
his
words
betrayed
gertrude
mine
own
dear
lord
and
husband
wilt
thou
take
a
word
of
honest
counsel
from
thy
wife
i
boast
to
be
the
noble
iberg
child
a
man
of
wide
experience
many
a
time
as
we
sat
spinning
in
the
winter
nights
my
sisters
and
myself
the
people
chiefs
were
wont
to
gather
round
our
father
hearth
to
read
the
old
imperial
charters
and
to
hold
sage
converse
on
the
country
weal
then
heedfully
i
listened
marking
well
what
or
the
wise
men
thought
or
good
man
wished
and
garnered
up
their
wisdom
in
my
heart
hear
then
and
mark
me
well
for
thou
wilt
see
i
long
have
known
the
grief
that
weighs
thee
down
the
viceroy
hates
thee
fain
would
injure
thee
for
thou
hast
crossed
his
wish
to
bend
the
swiss
in
homage
to
this
upstart
house
of
princes
and
kept
them
stanch
like
their
good
sires
of
old
in
true
allegiance
to
the
empire
say
not
so
werner
tell
nee
am
i
wrong
stauffacher
is
even
so
for
this
doth
gessler
hate
me
gertrude
he
burns
with
envy
too
to
see
thee
living
happy
and
free
on
thy
inheritance
for
he
has
none
from
the
emperor
himself
thou
holdest
in
fief
the
lands
thy
fathers
left
thee
there
not
a
prince
in
the
empire
that
can
show
a
better
title
to
his
heritage
for
thou
hast
over
thee
no
lord
but
one
and
he
the
mightiest
of
all
christian
kings
gessler
we
know
is
but
a
younger
son
his
only
wealth
the
knightly
cloak
he
wears
he
therefore
views
an
honest
man
good
fortune
with
a
malignant
and
a
jealous
eye
long
has
he
sworn
to
compass
thy
destruction
as
yet
thou
art
uninjured
wilt
thou
wait
till
he
may
safely
give
his
malice
scope
a
wise
man
would
anticipate
the
blow
stauffacher
what
to
be
done
gertrude
now
hear
what
i
advise
thou
knowest
well
how
here
with
us
in
schwytz
all
worthy
men
are
groaning
underneath
this
gessler
grasping
grinding
tyranny
doubt
not
the
men
of
unterwald
as
well
and
uri
too
are
chafing
like
ourselves
at
this
oppressive
and
yoke
for
there
across
the
lake
the
landenberg
wields
the
same
iron
rule
as
gessler
here
no
comes
over
to
our
side
but
brings
the
tidings
of
some
new
encroachment
some
outrage
fresh
more
grievous
than
the
last
then
it
were
well
that
some
of
you
true
men
men
sound
at
heart
should
secretly
devise
how
best
to
shake
this
hateful
thraldom
off
well
do
i
know
that
god
would
not
desert
you
but
lend
his
favor
to
the
righteous
cause
hast
thou
no
friend
in
uri
say
to
whom
thou
frankly
unbosom
all
thy
thoughts
stauffacher
i
know
full
many
a
gallant
fellow
there
and
nobles
too
great
men
of
high
repute
in
whom
i
can
repose
unbounded
trust
rising
wife
what
a
storm
of
wild
and
perilous
thoughts
hast
thou
stirred
up
within
my
tranquil
breast
the
darkest
musings
of
my
bosom
thou
hast
dragged
to
light
and
placed
them
full
before
me
and
what
i
scarce
dared
harbor
in
thought
thou
speakest
plainly
out
with
fearless
tongue
but
hast
thou
weighed
well
what
thou
urgest
thus
discord
will
come
and
the
fierce
clang
of
arms
to
scare
this
valley
long
unbroken
peace
if
we
a
feeble
shepherd
race
shall
dare
him
to
the
fight
that
lords
it
the
world
even
now
they
only
wait
some
fair
pretext
for
setting
loose
their
savage
warrior
hordes
to
scourge
and
ravage
this
devoted
land
to
lord
it
us
with
the
victor
rights
and
the
show
of
lawful
chastisement
despoil
us
of
our
chartered
liberties
gertrude
you
too
are
men
can
wield
a
as
well
as
they
god
deserts
the
brave
stauffacher
oh

a
horrid
ruthless

my

i
hurl
the

stauffacher

may
possibly
conduct

tell
all
we
can
do
is
to
endure
in

his

you
desert

i
only
laid
my

did
no

what

unyoked

from

they
lowed

with

no

oh

sorry
for

my

the

detests
him
because

him
hard
the
poor
old

and
there
is
none
to

him
from
their

come
what
come

is
the
grave
of
freedom
stauffacher
friend
walter
furst
i
will
be
plain
with
you
no
idle
curiosity
it
is
that
brings
me
here
but
heavy
cares
i
left
thraldom
at
home
and
thraldom
meets
me
here
our
wrongs
now
are
more
than
we
can
bear
and
who
shall
tell
us
where
they
are
to
end
from
eldest
time
the
switzer
has
been
free
accustomed
only
to
the
mildest
rule
such
things
as
now
we
suffer
were
known
since
herdsmen
first
drove
cattle
to
the
hills
furst
yes
our
oppressions
are
unparalleled
why
even
our
own
good
lord
of
attinghaus
who
lived
in
olden
times
himself
declares
they
are
no
longer
to
be
tamely
borne
stauffacher
in
unterwalden
yonder
is
the
same
and
bloody
has
the
retribution
been
the
imperial
seneschal
the
wolfshot
who
at
rossberg
dwelt
longed
for
forbidden
fruits
baumgarten
wife
that
lives
at
alzellen
he
wished
to
overcome
in
shameful
sort
on
which
the
husband
slew
him
with
his
axe
furst
oh
heaven
is
just
in
all
its
judgments
still
baumgarten
say
you
a
most
worthy
man
has
he
escaped
and
is
he
safely
hid
stauffacher
your
conveyed
him
the
lake
and
he
lies
hidden
in
my
house
at
steinen
he
brought
the
tidings
with
him
of
a
thing
that
has
been
done
at
sarnen
worse
than
all
a
thing
to
make
the
very
heart
run
blood
furst
attentively
say
on
what
is
it
stauffacher
there
dwells
in
melchthal
then
just
as
you
enter
by
the
road
from
kearns
an
upright
man
named
henry
of
the
halden
a
man
of
weight
and
influence
in
the
diet
furst
who
knows
him
not
but
what
of
him
proceed
stauffacher
the
landenberg
to
punish
some
offence
committed
by
the
old
man
son
it
seems
had
given
command
to
take
the
youth
best
pair
of
oxen
from
his
plough
on
which
the
lad
struck
down
the
messenger
and
took
to
flight
furst
but
the
old
father
tell
me
what
of
him
stauffacher
the
landenberg
sent
for
him
and
required
he
should
produce
his
son
upon
the
spot
and
when
the
old
man
protested
and
with
truth
that
he
knew
nothing
of
the
fugitive
the
tyrant
called
his
torturers
furst
springs
up
and
tries
to
lead
him
to
the
other
side
hush
no
more
stauffacher
with
increasing
warmth
and
though
thy
son
he
cried
has
escaped
me
now
i
have
thee
fast
and
thou
shalt
feel
my
vengeance
with
that
they
flung
the
old
man
to
the
earth
and
plunged
the
pointed
steel
into
his
eyes
furst
merciful
heavens
melchthal
rushing
out
into
his
eyes
his
eyes
stauffacher
addresses
himself
in
astonishment
to
walter
furst
who
is
this
youth
melchthal
grasping
him
convulsively
into
his
eyes
speak

furst
oh
miserable
hour
stauffacher
who
is
it
tell
me
stauffacher
makes
a
sign
to
him
it
is
his
son
all
righteous
heaven
melchthal
and
i
must
be
from
thence
what
into
both
his
eyes
furst
be
calm
be
calm
and
bear
it
like
a
man
melchthal
and
all
for
me
for
my
mad
wilful
folly
blind
did
you
say
quite
blind
and
both
his
eyes
stauffacher
even
so
the
fountain
of
his
sight
dried
up
he
will
see
the
blessed
sunshine
more
furst
oh
spare
his
anguish
melchthal
never
never
more
presses
his
hands
upon
his
eyes
and
is
silent
for
some
moments
then
turning
from
one
to
the
other
speaks
in
a
subdued
tone
broken
by
sobs
o
the
eye
light
of
all
the
gifts
of
heaven
the
dearest
best
from
light
all
beings
live
each
fair
created
thing
the
very
plants
turn
with
a
joyful
transport
to
the
light
and
he
he
must
drag
on
through
all
his
days
in
endless
darkness
never
more
for
him
the
sunny
meads
shall
glow
the
flowerets
bloom
nor
shall
he
more
behold
the
roseate
tints
of
the
iced
mountain
top
to
die
is
nothing
but
to
have
life
and
not
have
sight
oh
that
is
misery
indeed
why
do
you
look
so
piteously
at
me
i
have
two
eyes
yet
to
my
poor
blind
father
can
give
neither
no
not
one
gleam
of
that
great
sea
of
light
that
with
its
dazzling
splendor
floods
my
gaze
stauffacher
ah
i
must
swell
the
measure
of
your
grief
instead
of
soothing
it
the
worst
alas
remains
to
tell
they
stripped
him
of
his
all
naught
have
they
left
him
save
his
staff
on
which
blind
and
in
rags
he
moves
from
door
to
door
melchthal
naught
but
his
staff
to
the
old
eyeless
man
stripped
of
his
all
even
of
the
light
of
day
the
common
blessing
of
the
meanest
wretch
tell
me
no
more
of
patience
of
concealment
oh
what
a
base
and
coward
thing
am
i
that
on
mine
own
security
i
thought
and
took
no
care
of
thine
thy
precious
head
left
as
a
pledge
within
the
tyrant
grasp
hence
prudence
hence
and
all
my
thoughts
be
vengeance
and
the
despot
blood
i
seek
him
straight
no
power
shall
stay
me
now
and
at
his
hands
demand
my
father
eyes
i
beard
him
a
thousand
myrmidons
what
life
to
me
if
in
his
heart
best
blood
i
cool
the
fever
of
this
mighty
anguish
he
is
going
furst
stay
this
is
madness
melchthal
what
avails
your
single
arm
against
his
power
he
sits
at
sarnen
high
within
his
lordly
keep
and
safe
within
its
battlemented
walls
may
laugh
to
scorn
your
unavailing
rage
melchthal
and
though
he
sat
within
the
icy
domes
of
yon
far
schreckhorn
ay
or
higher
where
veiled
since
eternity
the
jungfrau
soars
still
to
the
tyrant
would
i
make
my
way
with
twenty
comrades
minded
like
myself
i
lay
his
fastness
level
with
the
earth
and
if
none
follow
me
and
if
you
all
in
terror
for
your
homesteads
and
your
herds
bow
in
submission
to
the
tyrant
yoke
i
call
the
herdsmen
on
the
hills
around
me
and
there
beneath
heaven
free
and
boundless
roof
where
men
still
feel
as
men
and
hearts
are
true
proclaim
aloud
this
foul
enormity
stauffacher
to
furst
is
at
its
height
and
are
we
then
to
wait
till
some
extremity
melchthal
what
extremity
remains
for
apprehension
where
men
eyes
have
ceased
to
be
secure
within
their
sockets
are
we
defenceless
wherefore
did
we
learn
to
bend
the
crossbow
wield
the
what
living
creature
but
in
its
despair
finds
for
itself
a
weapon
of
defence
the
baited
stag
will
turn
and
with
the
show
of
his
dread
antlers
hold
the
hounds
at
bay
the
chamois
drags
the
huntsman
down
the
abyss
the
very
ox
the
partner
of
man
toil
the
sharer
of
his
roof
that
meekly
bends
the
strength
of
his
huge
neck
beneath
the
yoke
springs
up
if
he
provoked
whets
his
strong
horn
and
tosses
his
tormenter
to
the
clouds
furst
if
the
three
cantons
thought
as
we
three
do
something
might
then
be
done
with
good
effect
stauffacher
when
uri
calls
when
unterwald
replies
schwytz
will
be
mindful
of
her
ancient
league
melchthal
i
many
friends
in
unterwald
and
none
that
would
not
gladly
venture
life
and
limb
if
fairly
backed
and
aided
by
the
rest
oh
sage
and
reverend
fathers
of
this
land
here
do
i
stand
before
your
riper
years
an
unskilled
youth
whose
voice
must
in
the
diet
still
be
subdued
into
respectful
silence
do
not
because
that
i
am
young
and
want
experience
slight
my
counsel
and
my
words
is
not
the
wantonness
of
youthful
blood
that
fires
my
spirit
but
a
pang
so
deep
that
even
the
flinty
rocks
must
pity
me
you
too
are
fathers
heads
of
families
and
you
must
wish
to
have
a
virtuous
son
to
reverence
your
gray
hairs
and
shield
your
eyes
with
pious
and
affectionate
regard
do
not
i
pray
because
in
limb
and
fortune
you
still
are
unassailed
and
still
your
eyes
revolve
undimmed
and
sparkling
in
their
spheres
oh
do
not
therefore
disregard
our
wrongs
above
you
too
doth
hang
the
tyrant
sword
you
too
have
striven
to
alienate
the
land
from
austria
this
was
all
my
father
crime
you
share
his
guilt
and
may
his
punishment
stauffacher
to
furst
do
then
resolve
i
am
prepared
to
follow
furst
first
let
us
learn
what
steps
the
noble
lords
von
sillinen
and
attinghaus
propose
their
names
would
rally
thousands
in
the
cause
melchthal
is
there
a
name
within
the
forest
mountains
that
carries
more
respect
than
thine
and
thine
to
names
like
these
the
people
cling
for
help
with
confidence
such
names
are
household
words
rich
was
your
heritage
of
manly
virtue
and
richly
have
you
added
to
its
stores
what
need
of
nobles
let
us
do
the
work
ourselves
although
we
stood
alone
methinks
we
should
be
able
to
maintain
our
rights
stauffacher
the
nobles
wrongs
are
not
so
great
as
ours
the
torrent
that
lays
waste
the
lower
grounds
hath
not
ascended
to
the
uplands
yet
but
let
them
see
the
country
once
in
arms
they
not
refuse
to
lend
a
helping
hand
furst
were
there
an
umpire
ourselves
and
austria
justice
and
law
might
then
decide
our
quarrel
but
our
oppressor
is
our
emperor
too
and
judge
supreme
is
god
must
help
us
then
and
our
own
arm
be
yours
the
task
to
rouse
the
men
of
schwytz
i
rally
friends
in
uri
but
whom
are
we
to
send
to
unterwald
melchthal
thither
send
me
whom
should
it
more
concern
furst
no
melchthal
no
thou
art
my
guest
and
i
must
answer
for
thy
safety
melchthal
let
me
go
i
know
each
forest
track
and
mountain
pass
friends
too
i
find
be
sure
on
every
hand
to
give
me
willing
shelter
from
the
foe
stauffacher
nay
let
him
go
no
traitors
harbor
there
for
tyranny
is
so
abhorred
in
unterwald
no
minions
can
be
found
to
work
her
will
in
the
low
valleys
too
the
alzeller
will
gain
confederates
and
rouse
the
country
melchthal
but
how
shall
we
communicate
and
not
awaken
the
suspicion
of
the
tyrants
stauffacher
might
we
not
meet
at
brunnen
or
at
treib
hard
by
the
spot
where
land
furst
we
must
not
go
so
openly
to
work
hear
my
opinion
on
the
lake
left
bank
as
we
sail
hence
to
brunnen
right
against
the
mytenstein
in
the
wood
a
meadow
lies
by
shepherds
called
the
rootli
because
the
wood
has
been
uprooted
there
is
where
our
canton
boundaries
verge
on
yours
to
melchthal
your
boat
will
carry
you
across
from
schwytz
to
stauffacher
thither
by
lonely
let
us
wend
at
midnight
and
deliberate
our
plans
let
each
bring
with
him
there
ten
trusty
men
all
one
at
heart
with
us
and
then
we
may
consult
together
for
the
general
weal
and
with
god
guidance
fix
our
onward
course
stauffacher
so
let
it
be
and
now
your
true
right
hand
yours
too
young
man
and
as
we
now
three
men
among
ourselves
thus
knit
our
hands
together
in
all
sincerity
and
truth
so
shall
we
three
cantons
too
together
stand
in
victory
and
defeat
in
life
and
death
furst
and
melchthal
in
life
and
death
they
hold
their
hands
clasped
together
for
some
moments
in
silence
melchthal
alas
my
old
blind
father
thou
canst
no
more
behold
the
day
of
freedom
but
thou
shalt
hear
it
when
from
alp
to
alp
the
throw
up
their
flaming
signs
and
the
proud
castles
of
the
tyrants
fall
into
thy
cottage
shall
the
switzer
burst
bear
the
glad
tidings
to
thine
ear
and
thy
darkened
way
shall
freedom

pour

i
the
mansion
of
the
baron
of
attinghausen
a
gothic
hall
decorated
with
escutcheons
and
helmets
the

a
man
years
old
tall
and
of
a
commanding
mien
clad
in
a
furred
pelisse
and
leaning
on
a

uncle
i
here
your
will
attinghausen
first
let
me
share
after
the
ancient
custom
of
our
house
the
with
these
my
faithful
servants
he
drinks
from
a
cup
which
is
then
passed
round
time
was
i
stood
myself
in
field
and
wood
with
mine
own
eyes
directing
all
their
toil
even
as
my
banner
led
them
in
the
fight
now
i
am
only
fit
to
play
the
steward
and
if
the
genial
sun
come
not
to
me
i
can
no
longer
seek
it
on
the
mountains
thus
slowly
in
an
sphere
i
move
on
to
the
narrowest
and
the
last
where
all
life
pulses
cease
i
now
am
but
the
shadow
of
my
former
self
and
that
is
fading
fast
soon
be
but
a
name
kuoni
offering
rudenz
the
cup
a
pledge
young
master
rudenz
hesitates
to
take
the
cup
nay
sir
drink
it
off
one
cup
one
heart
you
know
our
proverb
sir
attinghausen
go
children
and
at
eve
when
work
is
done
we
meet
and
talk
the
country
business
over
exeunt
servants
belted
and
plumed
and
all
thy
bravery
on
thou
art
for
altdorf
for
the
castle
boy
rudenz
yes
uncle
longer
may
i
not
delay
attinghausen
sitting
down
why
in
such
haste
say
are
thy
youthful
hours
doled
in
such
niggard
measure
that
thou
must
be
chary
of
then
to
thy
aged
uncle
rudenz
i
see
my
presence
is
not
needed
here
i
am
but
as
a
stranger
in
this
house
attinghausen
gazes
fixedly
at
him
for
a
considerable
time
alas
thou
art
indeed
alas
that
home
to
thee
has
grown
so
strange
oh
uly
uly
i
scarce
do
know
thee
now
thus
decked
in
silks
the
peacock
feather
flaunting
in
thy
cap
and
purple
mantle
round
thy
shoulders
flung
thou
lookest
upon
the
peasant
with
disdain
and
takest
with
a
blush
his
honest
greeting
rudenz
all
honor
due
to
him
i
gladly
pay
but
must
deny
the
right
he
would
usurp
attinghausen
the
sore
displeasure
of
the
king
is
resting
upon
the
land
and
every
true
man
heart
is
full
of
sadness
for
the
grievous
wrongs
we
suffer
from
our
tyrants
thou
alone
art
all
unmoved
amid
the
general
grief
abandoning
thy
friends
thou
takest
thy
stand
beside
thy
country
foes
and
as
in
scorn
of
our
distress
pursuest
giddy
joys
courting
the
smiles
of
princes
all
the
while
thy
country
bleeds
beneath
their
cruel
scourge
rudenz
the
land
is
sore
oppressed
i
know
it
uncle
but
why
who
plunged
it
into
this
distress
a
word
one
little
easy
word
might
buy
instant
deliverance
from
such
dire
oppression
and
win
the
of
the
emperor
woe
unto
those
who
seal
the
people
eyes
and
make
them
adverse
to
their
country
good
the
men
who
for
their
own
vile
selfish
ends
are
seeking
to
prevent
the
forest
states
from
swearing
fealty
to
austria
house
as
all
the
countries
round
about
have
done
it
fits
their
humor
well
to
take
their
seats
amid
the
nobles
on
the
herrenbank
they
have
the
caesar
for
their
lord
forsooth
that
is
to
say
they
have
no
lord
at
all
attinghausen
must
i
hear
this
and
from
thy
lips
rash
boy
rudenz
you
urged
me
to
this
answer
hear
me
out
what
uncle
is
the
character
you
stooped
to
fill
contentedly
through
life
have
you
no
higher
pride
than
in
these
lonely
wilds
to
be
the
landamman
or
banneret
the
petty
chieftain
of
a
shepherd
race
how
were
it
not
a
far
more
glorious
choice
to
bend
in
homage
to
our
royal
lord
and
swell
the
princely
splendors
of
his
court
than
sit
at
home
the
peer
of
your
own
vassals
and
share
the
with
vulgar
clowns
attinghausen
ah
uly
uly
all
too
well
i
see
the
tempter
voice
has
caught
thy
willing
ear
and
poured
its
subtle
poison
in
thy

brook
while
all
the

around

melchthal
oh
worthy
stauffacher
i
looked
but
now
on
him
who
could
not
look
on
me
again
i
laid
my
hands
upon
his
rayless
eyes
and
on
their
vacant
orbits
sworn
a
vow
of
vengeance
only
to
be
cooled
in
blood
stauffacher
speak
not
of
vengeance
we
are
here
to
meet
the
threatened
evil
not
to
avenge
the
past
now
tell
me
what
you
done
and
what
secured
to
aid
the
common
cause
in
unterwald
how
stands
the
peasantry
disposed
and
how
yourself
escaped
the
wiles
of
treachery
melchthal
through
the
surenen
fearful
mountain
chain
where
dreary
stretch
on
every
side
and
sound
is
none
save
the
hoarse
vulture
cry
i
reached
the
alpine
pasture
where
the
herds
from
uri
and
from
engelberg
resort
and
turn
their
cattle
forth
to
graze
in
common
still
as
i
went
along
i
slaked
my
thirst
with
the
coarse
oozings
of
the
lofty
glacier
that
through
the
crevices
come
foaming
down
and
turned
to
rest
me
in
the
herdsman
cots
where
i
was
host
and
guest
until
i
gained
the
cheerful
homes
and
social
haunts
of
men
already
through
these
distant
vales
had
spread
the
rumor
of
this
last
atrocity
and
i
went
at
every
door
kind
words
and
gentle
looks
were
there
to
greet
me
i
found
these
simple
spirits
all
in
arms
against
our
rulers
tyrannous
encroachments
for
as
their
alps
through
each
succeeding
year
yield
the
same
roots
their
streams
flow
ever
on
in
the
same
channels
nay
the
clouds
and
winds
the
selfsame
course
unalterably
pursue
so
have
old
customs
there
from
sire
to
son
been
handed
down
unchanging
and
unchanged
nor
will
they
brook
to
swerve
or
turn
aside
from
the
fixed
even
tenor
of
their
life
with
grasp
of
their
hard
hands
they
welcomed
me
took
from
the
walls
their
rusty
falchions
down
and
from
their
eyes
the
soul
of
valor
flashed
with
joyful
lustre
as
i
spoke
those
names
sacred
to
every
peasant
in
the
mountains
your
own
and
walter
fuerst
your
voice
should
dictate
as
the
right
they
swore
to
do
and
you
they
swore
to
follow
to
death
so
sped
i
on
from
house
to
house
secure
in
the
guest
sacred
privilege
and
when
i
reached
at
last
the
valley
of
my
home
where
dwell
my
kinsmen
scattered
far
and
near
and
when
i
found
my
father
stripped
and
blind
upon
the
stranger
straw
fed
by
the
alms
of
charity
stauffacher
great
heaven
melchthal
yet
wept
i
not
no
not
in
weak
and
unavailing
tears
spent
i
the
force
of
my
fierce
burning
anguish
deep
in
my
bosom
like
some
precious
treasure
i
locked
it
fast
and
thought
on
deeds
alone
through
every
winding
of
the
hills
i
crept
no
valley
so
remote
but
i
explored
it
nay
even
at
the
glacier
base
i
sought
and
found
the
homes
of
living
men
and
still
my
wandering
footsteps
turned
the
hatred
of
these
tyrants
met
me
for
even
there
at
vegetation
verge
where
the
numbed
earth
is
barren
of
all
fruits
there
grasping
hands
had
been
stretched
forth
for
plunder
into
the
hearts
of
all
this
honest
race
the
story
of
my
wrongs
struck
deep
and
now
they
to
a
man
are
ours
both
heart
and
hand
great
things
indeed
you
wrought
in
little
time
melchthal
i
did
still
more
than
this
the
fortresses
rossberg
and
sarnen
are
the
country
dread
for
from
behind
their
rocky
walls
the
foe
swoops
as
the
eagle
from
his
eyrie
down
and
safe
himself
spreads
havoc
the
land
with
my
own
eyes
i
wished
to
weigh
its
strength
so
went
to
sarnen
and
explored
the
castle
stauffacher
how
risk
thyself
even
in
the
tiger
den
melchthal
disguised
in
pilgrim
weeds
i
entered
it
i
saw
the
viceroy
feasting
at
his
board
judge
if
i
master
of
myself
or
no
i
saw
the
tyrant
and
i
slew
him
not
stauffacher
fortune
indeed
has
smiled
upon
your
boldness
meanwhile
the
others
have
arrived
and
join
melchthal
and
stauffacher
yet
tell
me
now
i
pray
who
are
the
friends
the
worthy
men
who
came
along
with
you
make
me
acquainted
with
them
that
we
may
speak
frankly
man

these
two
are
men
belonging
to
the
convent

engelberg
and
live
behind

you
not
think
ill
of
them
because
they
serfs
and
sit
not

upon
the

like
us
they
love
the
land
and
bear
a
good
repute
stauffacher
to
them
give
me
your

he
has
good
cause
for
thanks

walk

meet
the
three
cantons

here
upon

lake
inhospitable
shore
and
what
the
purport
of
the
new
alliance
we
here
contract
beneath
the
starry
heaven
stauffacher
entering
the
circle
no
new
alliance
do
we
now
contract
but
one
our
fathers
framed
in
ancient
times
we
purpose
to
renew
for
know
confederates
though
mountain
ridge
and
lake
divide
our
bounds
and
every
canton
ruled
by
its
own
laws
yet
are
we
but
one
race
born
of
one
blood
and
all
are
children
of
one
common
home
winkelried
then
is
the
burden
of
our
legends
true
that
we
came
hither
from
a
distant
land
oh
tell
us
what
you
know
that
our
new
league
may
reap
fresh
vigor
from
the
leagues
of
old
stauffacher
hear
then
what
aged
herdsmen
tell
there
dwelt
a
mighty
people
in
the
land
that
lies
back
to
the
north
the
scourge
of
famine
came
and
in
this
strait
was
publicly
resolved
that
each
tenth
man
on
whom
the
lot
might
fall
should
leave
the
country
they
obeyed
and
forth
with
loud
lamentings
men
and
women
went
a
mighty
host
and
to
the
south
moved
on
cutting
their
way
through
germany
by
the
sword
until
they
gained
that
hills
of
ours
nor
stopped
they
ever
on
their
forward
course
till
at
the
shaggy
dell
they
halted
where
the
mueta
flows
through
its
luxuriant
meads
no
trace
of
human
creature
met
their
eye
save
one
poor
hut
upon
the
desert
shore
where
dwelt
a
lonely
man
and
kept
the
ferry
a
tempest
raged
the
lake
rose
mountains
high
and
barred
their
further
progress
thereupon
they
viewed
the
country
found
it
rich
in
wood
discovered
goodly
springs
and
felt
as
they
were
in
their
own
dear
native
land
once
more
then
they
resolved
to
settle
on
the
spot
erected
there
the
ancient
town
of
schwytz
and
many
a
day
of
toil
had
they
to
clear
the
tangled
brake
and
forest
spreading
roots
meanwhile
their
numbers
grew
the
soil
became
unequal
to
sustain
them
and
they
crossed
to
the
black
mountain
far
as
weissland
where
concealed
behind
eternal
walls
of
ice
another
people
speak
another
tongue
they
built
the
village
stanz
beside
the
kernwald
the
village
altdorf
in
the
vale
of
reuss
yet
ever
mindful
of
their
parent
stem
the
men
of
schwytz
from
all
the
stranger
race
that
since
that
time
have
settled
in
the
land
each
other
recognize
their
hearts
still
know
and
beat
fraternally
to
kindred
blood
extends
his
hand
right
and
left
mauer
ay
we
are
all
one
heart
one
blood
one
race
all
joining
hands
we
are
one
people
and
will
act
as
one
stauffacher
the
nations
round
us
bear
a
foreign
yoke
for
they
have
yielded
to
the
conqueror
nay
even
within
our
frontiers
may
be
found
some
that
owe
villein
service
to
a
lord
a
race
of
bonded
serfs
from
sire
to
son
but
we
the
genuine
race
of
ancient
swiss
have
kept
our
freedom
from
the
first
till
now
never
to
princes
have
we
bowed
the
knee
freely
we
sought
protection
of
the
empire
rosselmann
freely
we
sought
it
freely
it
was
given
is
so
set
down
in
emperor
frederick
charter
stauffacher
for
the
most
free
have
still
some
feudal
lord
there
must
be
still
a
chief
a
judge
supreme
to
whom
appeal
may
lie
in
case
of
strife
and
therefore
was
it
that
our
sires
allowed
for
what
they
had
recovered
from
the
waste
this
honor
to
the
emperor
the
lord
of
all
the
german
and
italian
soil
and
like
the
other
freemen
of
his
realm
engaged
to
aid
him
with
their
swords
in
war
and
this
alone
should
be
the
freeman
duty
to
guard
the
empire
that
keeps
guard
for
him
melchthal
he
but
a
slave
that
would
acknowledge
more
stauffacher
they
followed
when
the
heribann
went
forth
the
imperial
standard
and
they
fought
its
battles
to
italy
they
marched
in
arms
to
place
the
caesars
crown
upon
the
emperor
head
but
still
at
home
they
ruled
themselves
in
peace
by
their
own
laws
and
ancient
usages
the
emperor
only
right
was
to
adjudge
the
penalty
of
death
he
therefore
named
some
mighty
noble
as
his
delegate
that
had
no
stake
or
interest
in
the
land
he
was
called
in
when
doom
was
to
be
passed
and
in
the
face
of
day
pronounced
decree
clear
and
distinctly
fearing
no
man
hate
what
traces
here
that
we
are
bondsmen
speak
if
there
be
any
can
gainsay
my
words
hofe
no
you
have
spoken
but
the
simple
truth
we
never
stooped
beneath
a
tyrant
yoke
stauffacher
even
to
the
emperor
we
refused
obedience
when
he
gave
judgment
in
the
church
favor
for
when
the
abbey
of
einsiedlen
claimed
the
alp
our
fathers
and
ourselves
had
grazed
and
showed
an
ancient
charter
which
bestowed
the
land
on
them
as
being
ownerless
for
our
existence
there
had
been
concealed
what
was
our
answer
this
the
grant
is
void
no
emperor
can
bestow
what
is
our
own
and
if
the
empire
shall
deny
us
justice
we
can
within
our
mountains
right
ourselves
thus
spake
our
fathers
and
shall
we
endure
the
shame
and
infamy
of
this
new
yoke
and
from
the
vassal
brook
what
never
king
dared
in
the
fulness
of
his
power
attempt
this
soil
we
have
created
for
ourselves
by
the
hard
labor
of
our
hands
we
changed
the
giant
forest
that
was
erst
the
haunt
of
savage
bears
into
a
home
for
man
extirpated
the
dragon
brood
that
wont
to
rise
distent
with
venom
from
the
swamps
rent
the
thick
misty
canopy
that
hung
its
blighting
vapors
on
the
dreary
waste
blasted
the
solid
rock
the
abyss
thrown
the
firm
bridge
for
the
wayfaring
man
by
the
possession
of
a
thousand
years
the
soil
is
ours
and
shall
an
alien
lord
himself
a
vassal
dare
to
venture
here
on
our
own
hearths
insult
us
and
attempt
to
forge
the
chains
of
bondage
for
our
hands
and
do
us
shame
on
our
own
proper
soil
is
there
no
help
against
such
wrong
as
this
great
sensation
among
the
people
yes
there
a
limit
to
the
despot
power
when
the
oppressed
looks
round
in
vain
for
justice
when
his
sore
burden
may
no
more
be
borne
with
fearless
heart
he
makes
appeal
to
heaven
and
thence
brings
down
his
everlasting
rights
which
there
abide
inalienably
his
and
indestructible
as
are

primeval

i
was
at
rheinfeld
at
the
emperor
palace
deputed
by
the
cantons
to
complain
of
the
oppression
of
these
governors
and
claim
the
charter
of
our
ancient
freedom
which
each
new
king
till
now
has
ratified
i
found
the
envoys
there
of
many
a
town
from
suabia
and
the
valley
of
the
rhine
who
all
received
their
parchments
as
they
wished
and
straight
went
home
again
with
merry
heart
they
sent
for
me
your
envoy
to
the
council
where
i
was
soon
dismissed
with
empty
comfort
the
emperor
at
present
was
engaged
some
other
time
he
would
attend
to
us
i
turned
away
and
passing
through
the
hall
with
heavy
heart
in
a
recess
i
saw
the
grand
duke
john
in
tears
and
by
his
side
the
noble
lords
of
wart
and
tegerfeld
who
beckoned
me
and
said
redress
yourselves
expect
not
justice
from
the
emperor
does
he
not
plunder
his
own
brother
child
and
keep
from
him
his
just
inheritance
the
duke
claims
his
maternal
property
urging
he
now
of
age
and
is
full
time
that
he
should
rule
his
people
and
dominions
what
is
the
answer
made
to
him
the
king
places
a
chaplet
on
his
head
behold
the
fitting
ornament
he
cries
of
youth
mauer
you
hear
expect
not
from
the
emperor
or
right
or
justice
then
redress
yourselves
reding
no
other
course
is
left
us
now
advise
what
plan
most
likely
to
insure
success
furst
to
shake
a
thraldom
off
that
we
abhor
to
keep
our
ancient
rights
inviolate
as
we
received
them
from
our
forefathers
this
not
lawless
innovation
is
our
aim
let
caesar
still
retain
what
is
his
due
and
he
that
is
a

let
him
pay
the
service
he
is

nothing

we
drive

hence
and
raze
their
towering
strongholds
to
the
ground
yet
shed
if
possible
no

let
the

see
that
we
were
driven
to
cast
the
sacred
duties
of
respect
away
and
when
he
finds
we
keep
within
our
bounds
his
wrath
belike

prithee
tell
us
how

meyer
is
easily
said
but
not
so
easily
done
two
fortresses
of
strength
command
the

they
shield
the
foe
and
should
the
king
invade
us
the
task
would
then
be
dangerous
indeed
rossberg

sarnen
both
must
be
secured
before
a

is
drawn
in

stauffacher
should
we
delay
the

soon
be
warned

there

heedlessly
betray

delay
till
christmas
is
then
the
custom
for
the
serfs
to
throng
the
castle
bringing
the

thus
may
some
ten

twelve
selected

assemble

not
long
ago
as
i
was
hunting
through
the
wild
ravines
of
shechenthal
untrod
by
mortal
foot
there
as
i
took
my
solitary
way
along
a
shelving
ledge
of
rocks
where
was
impossible
to
step
on
either
side
for
high
above
rose
like
a
giant
wall
the
precipice
side
and
far
below
the
shechen
thundered
its
rifted
bed
the
boys
press
towards
him
looking
upon
him
with
excited
curiosity
there
face
to
face
i
met
the
viceroy
he
alone
with
me
and
i
myself
alone
mere
man
to
man
and
near
us
the
abyss
and
when
his
lordship
had
perused
my
face
and
knew
the
man
he
had
severely
fined
on
some
most
trivial
ground
not
long
before
and
saw
me
with
my
sturdy
bow
in
hand
come
striding
towards
him
then
his
cheek
grew
pale
his
knees
refused
their
office
and
i
thought
he
would
have
sunk
against
the
mountain
side
then
touched
with
pity
for
him
i
advanced
respectfully
and
said
is
i
my
lord
but
a
sound
could
he
compel
his
lips
to
frame
an
answer
only
with
his
hand
he
beckoned
me
in
silence
to
proceed
so
i
passed
on
and
sent
his
train
to
seek
him
hedwig
he
trembled
then
before
you
woe
the
while
you
saw
his
weakness
that
he
not
forgive
tell
i
shun
him
therefore
and
he
not
seek
me
hedwig
but
stay
away
to
day

hunting
rather
tell
what
do
you
fear

thine
with
looks
so
stern
and
harsh
who
who
am

that
dare
aspire
so
high
as
unto
thee
fame
hath
not
stamped
me

nor
may
i
take
my
place
amid
the
courtly
throng
of
knights
that
crowned
with
glory
lustre
woo
thy
smiles
nothing
have
i
to
offer
but
a
heart
that
overflows
with
truth
and
love
for
thee
bertha
sternly
and
with
severity
and
dare
you
speak
to
me
of
love

thee
bertha

you
to
find
me
in
the
traitor
ranks
now
as
i
live
i
rather
give
my
hand
to
gessler
self
all
despot
though
he
be
than
to
the
switzer
who
forgets
his
birth
and
stoops
to
be
the
minion
of
a
tyrant
rudenz
oh
heaven
what
must
i
hear
bertha
say
what
can
lie
nearer
the
good
man
heart
than
friends
and
kindred
what
dearer
duty
to
a
noble
soul
than
to
protect
weak
suffering
innocence
and
vindicate
the
rights
of
the
oppressed
my
very
soul
bleeds
for
your
countrymen
i
suffer
with

so
full
of
power
they
draw
my
whole
heart
to
them
every

look
upon
them
with
increased
esteem
but
you
whom
nature
and
your
knightly
vow
have
given
them
as
their
natural
protector
yet
who
desert
them
and
abet
their
foes
in
forging
shackles
for
your

you
you
it
is
that
deeply

you
despise
me
bertha
nay
and
if

despicable
the
man
whom

will
rouse

it
must
have
cost
you
many
a
fiery
struggle

crush
the
virtues
of
your

interpose
to

bertha
all

i
am

rudenz
oh
what
a
prospect
bertha
hast
thou
shown
me
bertha
hope
not

win
my
hand
by
austria
favor
fain
would
they
lay
their
grasp
on
my
estates
to
swell
the
vast
domains
which
now
they
hold
the

rob
you
of

liberty
endangers
mine
oh

i
marked
for
sacrifice
to
be
the
guerdon
of
some
parasite
perchance
they
drag
me
hence
to
the
imperial
court
that
hateful
haunt
of
falsehood
and
intrigue
there
do
detested
marriage
bonds
await
me
love
love
alone
your
love
can
rescue
me
rudenz
and
thou
be
content
love
to
live
here
in

to
be
my
own
oh
bertha
all
the
yearnings
of
my
soul
for
this
great
world
and
its
tumultuous
strife
what
were
they
but
a
yearning
after
thee
in
glory
path
i
sought
for
thee
alone
and
all
my
thirst
of
fame
was
only
love
but
if
in
this
calm
vale
thou
canst
abide
with
me
and
bid
earth
pomps
and
pride
adieu
then
is
the
goal
of
my
ambition
won
and
the
rough
tide
of
the
tempestuous
world
may
dash
and
rave
around
these
hills
no
wandering
wishes
more
have
i
to

may
these

girdle
us
extend
their
giants

impenetrably
round

this
sequestered
happy
vale
alone
look
up
to

and
be
my
paradise
bertha
now
art
thou
all
my
fancy
dreamed
of
thee
my
trust
has
not
been
given
to
thee
in
vain
rudenz
away
ye
idle
phantoms
of
my
folly
in
mine
own
home
i
find
my
happiness
here
where
the
gladsome
boy
to
manhood
grew
where
every
brook
and
tree
and
mountain
peak
teems
with
remembrances
of
happy
hours
in
mine
own
native
land
thou
wilt
be
mine
ah
i
have
ever
loved
it
well
i
feel
how
poor
without
it
were
all
earthly
joys
bertha
where
should
we
look
for
happiness
on
earth
if
not
in
this
dear
land
of
innocence
here
where
old
truth
hath
its
familiar
home
where
fraud
and
guile
are
strangers
envy
shall
dim
the
sparkling
fountain
of
our
bliss
and
ever
bright
the
hours
shall
us
glide
there
do
i
see
thee
in
true
manly
worth
the
foremost
of
the
free
and
of
thy
peers
revered
with
homage
pure
and
unconstrained
wielding
a
power
that
kings
might
envy
thee
rudenz
and
thee
i
see
thy
sex
crowning
gem
with
thy
sweet
woman
grace
and
wakeful
love
building
a
heaven
for
me
within
my
home
and
as
the
springtime
scatters
forth
her
flowers
adorning
with
thy
charms
my
path
of
life
and
spreading
joy
and
sunshine
all
around
bertha
and
this
it
was
dear
friend

from

thy

scene
iii
a
meadow
near
altdorf
trees
in
the
foreground
at
the
back
of
the
stage
a
cap
upon
a
pole
the
prospect
is
bounded
by
the
bannberg
which
is
surmounted
by
a
mountain
friesshardt
and
leuthold
on
guard
friesshardt
we
keep
our
watch
in
vain
there
not
a
soul
will
pass
and
do
obeisance
to
the
cap
but
yesterday
the
place
swarmed
like
a
fair
now
the
whole
green
looks
like
a
very
desert
since
yonder
scarecrow
hung
upon
the
pole
leuthhold
only
the
vilest
rabble
show
themselves
and
wave
their
tattered
caps
in
mockery
at
us
all
honest
citizens
would
sooner
make
a
tedious
circuit
over
half
the
town
than
bend
their
backs
before
our
master
cap
friesshardt
they
were
obliged
to
pass
this
way
at
noon
as
they
were
coming
from
the
council
house
i
counted
then
upon
a
famous
catch
for
no
one
thought
of
bowing
to
the
cap
but
rosselmann
the
priest
was
even
with
me
coming
just
then
from
some
sick
penitent
he
stands
before
the
pole
raises
the
host
the
sacrist
too
must
tinkle
with
his
bell
when
down
they
dropped
on
knee
myself
and
all
in
reverence
to
the
host
but
not
the
cap
leuthold
hark
ye
companion
i
a
shrewd
suspicion
our
post
no
better
than
the
pillory
it
is
a
burning
shame
a
trooper
should
stand
sentinel
before
an
empty
cap
and
every
honest
fellow
must
despise
us
to
do
obeisance
to
a
cap
too
faith
i
never
heard
an
order
so
absurd
friesshardt
why
not
a
please
thee
to
an
empty
cap
ducked
i
sure
to
many
an
empty
sconce
hildegard
mechthild
and
elsbeth
enter
with
their
children
and
station
themselves
around
the
pole
leuthold
and
thou
art
an
officious
sneaking
knave
that
fond
of
bringing
honest
folks
to
trouble
for
my
part
he
that
likes
may
pass
the
cap
i
shut
my
eyes
and
take
no
note
of
him
mechthild
there
hangs
the
viceroy
your
obeisance
children
elsbeth
i
would
to
god
he
go
and
leave
his
cap
the
country
would
be
none
the
worse
for
it

driving
them
away
out
of
the
way
confounded

of
gossips
who
sent

they
have
courage
to
defy
the
order

with
his
crossbow
leading
his
son
walter
by
the
hand
they
pass
the
hat
without
noticing
it
and
advance
to
the
front
of
the
stage
walter
pointing
to
the
bannberg

true
that
on
the
mountain
there
the
trees
if
wounded
with
a
hatchet
bleed
tell
who
says
so
boy
walter
the
master
herdsman
father
he
tells
us
there
a
charm
upon
the
trees
and
if
a
man
shall
injure
them
the
hand
that
struck
the
blow
will
grow
from
out
the
grave
tell
there
is
a
charm
about
them
that
the
truth
dost
see
those
glaciers
yonder
those
white
horns
that
seem
to
melt
away
into
the
sky
walter
they
are
the
peaks
that
thunder
so
at
night
and
send
the
avalanches
down
upon
us
tell
they
are
and
altdorf
long
ago
had
been
submerged
beneath
these
avalanches
weight
did
not
the
forest
there
above
the
town
stand
like
a
bulwark
to
arrest
their
fall
walter
after
musing
a
little
and
are
there
countries
with
no
mountains
father
tell
yes
if
we
travel
downwards
from
our
heights
and
keep
descending
in
the
rivers
courses
we
reach
a
wide
and
level
country
where
our
mountain
torrents
brawl
and
foam
no
more
and
fair
large
rivers
glide
serenely
on
all
quarters
of
the
heaven
may
there
be
scanned
without
impediment
the
corn
grows
there
in
broad
and
lovely
fields
and
all
the
land
is
fair
as
any
garden
to
the
view
walter
but
father
tell
me
wherefore
haste
we
not
away
to
this
delightful
land
instead
of
toiling
here
and
struggling
as
we
do
tell
the
land
is
fair
and
bountiful
as
heaven
but
they
who
till
it
never
may
enjoy
the
fruits
of
what
they
sow
walter
live
they
not
free
as
you
do
on
the
land
their
fathers
left
them
tell
the
fields
are
all
the
bishop
or
the
king
walter
but
they
may
freely
hunt
among
the
woods
tell
the
game
is
all
the
monarch
bird
and
beast
walter
but
they
at
least
may
surely
fish
the
streams
tell

lake
and
sea
all
to
the
king
belong
walter
who
is
this
king
of
whom
they

protect
themselves
tell

tree
thou
shalt
approve
thy
skill
before

thy
bow
thou
hast
it
there
at
hand
and
make
thee
ready
to
shoot
an
apple
from
the
stripling
head

this
counsel

well
to
thine
aim

you

no
children
sir
you
do
not
know
the
tender
throbbings
of
a
father
heart
gessler
how
now
tell
so
discreet
upon
a
sudden
i
had
been
told
thou
wert
a
visionary
a
wanderer
from
the
paths
of
common
men
thou
lovest
the
marvellous
so
have
i
now
culled
out
for
thee
a
task
of
special
daring
another
man
might
pause
and
hesitate
thou
dashest
at
it
heart
and
soul
at
once
bertha
oh
do
not
jest
my
lord
with
these
poor
souls
see
how
they
tremble
and
how
pale
they
look
so
little
used
are
they
to
hear
thee
jest
gessler
who
tells
thee
that
i
jest
grasping
a
branch
above
his
head
here
is
the
apple
room
there
i
say
and
let
him
take
his
distance
just
eighty
the
custom
is
not
an
inch
more
or
less
it
was
his
boast
that
at
a
hundred
he
could
hit
his
man
now
archer
to
your
task
and
look
you
miss
not
harras
heavens
this
grows
serious
down
boy
on
your
knees
and
beg
the
governor
to
spare
your
life
furst
aside
to
melchthal
who
can
scarcely
restrain
his
impatience
command
yourself
be
calm
i
beg
of
you
bertha
to
the
governor
let
this
suffice
you
sir
it
is
inhuman
to
trifle
with
a
father
anguish
thus
although
this
wretched
man
had
forfeited
both
life
and
limb
for
such
a
slight
offence
already
has
he
suffered
tenfold
death
send
him
away
uninjured
to
his
home
he
know
thee
well
in
future
and
this
hour
he
and
his
children
children
will
remember
gessler
open
a
way
there
quick
why
this
delay
thy
life
is
forfeited
i
might
despatch
thee
and
see
i
graciously
repose
thy
fate
upon
the
skill
of
thine
own
practised
hand
no
cause
has
he
to
say
his
doom
is
harsh
who
made
the
master
of
his
destiny
thou
boastest
of
thy
steady
eye
is
well
now
is
a
fitting
time
to
show
thy
skill
the
mark
is
worthy
and
the
prize
is
great
to
hit
the
in
the
target
that
can
many
another
do
as
well
as
thou
but
he
methinks
is
master
of
his
craft
who
can
at
all
times
on
his
skill
rely
nor
lets
his
heart
disturb
or
eye
or
hand
furst
my
lord
we
bow
to
your
authority
but
oh
let
justice
yield
to
mercy
here
take
half
my
property
nay
take
it
all
but
spare
a
father
this
unnatural
doom
walter
grandfather
do
not
kneel
to
that
bad
man
say
where
am
i
to
stand
i
do
not
fear
my
father
strikes
the
bird
upon
the
wing
and
will
not
miss
now
when
harm
his
boy

the
child
innocence
not
touch
your
heart
rosselmann
bethink
you
sir
there
is
a
god
in
heaven
to
whom
you
must
account
for
all
your
deeds

those
who

the
delay
gessler

and
how
with
you
at
flueelen
he
embarked
all
this
we
know
say
how
have
you
escaped
tell
i
lay
on
deck
fast
bound
with
cords
disarmed
in
utter
hopelessness
i
did
not
think
again
to
see
the
gladsome
light
of
day
nor
the
dear
faces
of
my
wife
and
children
and
eyed
disconsolate
the
waste
of
waters
fisherman
oh
wretched
man
tell
then
we
put
forth
the
viceroy
rudolph
der
harras
and
their
suite
my
bow
and
quiver
lay
astern
beside
the
helm
and
just
as
we
had
reached
the
corner
near
the
little
axen
heaven
ordained
it
so
that
from
the
gotthardt
gorge
a
hurricane
swept
down
upon
us
with
such
headlong
force
that
every
rower
heart
within
him
sank
and
all
on
board
looked
for
a
watery
grave
then
heard
i
one
of
the
attendant
train
turning
to
gessler
in
this
strain
accost
him
you
see
our
danger
and
your
own
my
lord
and
that
we
hover
on
the
verge
of
death
the
boatmen
there
are
powerless
from
fear
nor
are
they
confident
what
course
to
take
now
here
is
tell
a
stout
and
fearless
man
and
knows
to
steer
with
more
than
common
skill
how
if
we
should
avail
ourselves
of
him
in
this
emergency
the
viceroy
then
addressed
me
thus
if
thou
wilt
undertake
to
bring
us
through
this
tempest
safely
tell
i
might
consent
to
free
thee
from
thy
bonds
i
answered
yes
my
lord
with
god
assistance
i
see
what
can
be
done
and
help
us
heaven
on
this
they
loosed
me
from
my
bonds
and
i
stood
by
the
helm
and
fairly
steered
along
yet
ever
eyed
my
askance
and
kept
a
watchful
eye
upon
the
shore
to
find
some
point
where
i
might
leap
to
land
and
when
i
had
descried
a
shelving
crag
that
jutted
smooth
atop
into
the
lake
fisherman
i
know
it
is
at
foot
of
the
great
axen
but
looks
so
steep
i
never
could
have
dreamed
possible
to
leap
it
from
the
boat
tell
i
bade
the
men
put
forth
their
utmost
might
until
we
came
before
the
shelving
crag
for
there
i
said
the
danger
will
be
past
stoutly
they
pulled
and
soon
we
neared
the
point
one
prayer
to
god
for
his
assisting
grace
and
straining
every
muscle
i
brought
round
the
vessel
stern
close
to
the
rocky
wall
then
snatching

are
doomed

fall
attinghausen
and
are
the
nobles
parties
to
this
league
stauffacher
we
trust
to
their
assistance
should
we
need
it
as
yet
the
peasantry
alone
have
sworn
attinghausen
raising
himself
up
in
great
astonishment
and
have
the
peasantry
dared
such
a
deed
on
their
own
charge
without
their
nobles
aid
relied
so
much
on
their
own
proper
strength
nay
then
indeed
they
want
our
help
no
more
we
may
go
down
to

the
thought
that
after

the

those
of

regard
him
for
some
moments
in
silence

then
retire
overcome
with
sorrow
meanwhile
the
servants
have
quietly
pressed
into
the
chamber
testifying
different
degrees
of
grief

brief
moments
more
to

the
change
that
has
come

agony
of
this
suspense

the

sloping

from

here
i

the

is
good
yon

thence
my

will
surely
reach

now
gessler
balance
thine
account
with
heaven
thou
must
away
from
earth
thy
sand
is
run
i
led
a
peaceful
inoffensive
life
my
bow
was
bent
on
forest
game
alone
and
my
pure
soul
was
free
from
thoughts
of
murder
but
thou
hast
scared
me
from
my
dream
of
peace
the
milk
of
human
kindness
thou
hast
turned
to
rankling
poison
in
my
breast
and
made
appalling
deeds
familiar
to
my
soul
he
who
could
make
his
own
child
head
his
mark
can
speed
his
arrow
to
his
foeman
heart
my
children
dear
my
loved
and
faithful
wife
must
be
protected
tyrant
from
thy
fury
when
last
i
drew
my
bow
with
trembling
hand
and
thou
with
murderous
joy
a
father
forced
to
level
at
his
child
when
all
in
vain
writhing
before
thee
i
implored
thy
mercy
then
in
the
agony
of
my
soul
i
vowed
a
fearful
oath
which
met
god
ear
alone
that
when
my
bow
next
winged
an
arrow
flight
its
aim
should
be
thy
heart
the
vow
i
made
amid
the
hellish
torments
of
that
moment
i
hold
a
sacred
debt
and
i
will
pay
it
thou
art
my
lord
my
emperor
delegate
yet
would
the
emperor
not
have
stretched
his
power
so
far
as
thou
he
sent
thee
to
these
cantons
to
deal
forth
law
stern
law
for
he
is
angered
but
not
to
wanton
with
unbridled
will
in
every
cruelty
with
fiendlike
joy
there
is
a
god
to
punish
and
avenge
come
forth
thou
bringer
once
of
bitter
pangs
my
precious
jewel
now
my
chiefest
treasure
a
mark
i
set
thee
which
the
cry
of
grief
could
never
penetrate
but
thou
shalt
pierce
it
and
thou
my
trusty
bowstring
that
so
oft
has
served
me
faithfully
in
sportive
scenes
desert
me
not
in
this
most
serious
hour
only
be
true
this
once
my
own
good
cord
that
has
so
often
winged
the
biting
shaft
for
shouldst
thou
fly
successless
from
my
hand
i
have
no
second
to
send
after
thee
travellers
pass
over
the
stage
i
sit
me
down
upon
this
bench
of
stone
hewn
for
the
wayworn
traveller
brief
repose
for
here
there
is
no
home
each
hurries
by
the
other
with
quick
step
and
careless
look
nor
stays
to
question
of
his
grief
here
goes
the
merchant
full
of
care
the
pilgrim
next
with
slender
scrip
and
then
the
pious
monk
the
scowling
robber
and
the
jovial
player
the
carrier
with
his
horse

comes
to

haunts
of

road

with
joy

mountain
toils

ever
brought
some
little
present
with
him
a
lovely
alpine
flower
a
curious
bird
or
found
by
wanderers
on
the
hills
but
now
he
goes
in
quest
of
other
game
in
the
wild
pass
he
sits
and
broods
on
murder
and
watches
for
the
of
his
foe
but
still
his
thoughts
are
fixed
on
you
alone

jagged
slippery
steeps

limbs
are
glued
by
his

took
the

i
had
stormed
the
night

but
hear
what
chanced
scarce
had
we
driven
the
foe
forth
from

and
given
it
to
the
flames
that
now
rose
crackling
upwards
to
the

when
from

rushed
diethelm

exclaiming

falling
melchthal
was
she
herself
here
had
she
been
immured
in
secret
by

viceroy
orders
rudenz
sprang
up
in
frenzy
for
we
heard
the
beams
and
massive
pillars
crashing
down

through

volumed
smoke
the
piteous
shrieks
of
the
unhappy
lady
furst
is
she
saved
melchthal
here
was
a
time
for
promptness
and
decision
had
he
been
nothing
but
our
baron
then
we
should
have
been
most
chary
of
our
lives
but
he
was
our
confederate
and
bertha
honored
the
people
so
without
a
thought
we
risked
the
worst
and
rushed
into
the
flames
furst
but
is
she
saved
melchthal
she
is
rudenz
and
i
bore
her
between
us
from
the
blazing
pile
with
crashing
timbers
toppling
all
around
and
when
she
had
revived
the
danger
past
and
raised
her
eyes
to
meet
the
light
of
heaven
the
baron
fell
upon
my
breast
and
then
a
silent
vow
of
friendship
passed
between
us
a
vow
that
tempered
in
yon
furnace
heat
will
last
through
every
shock
of
time
and
fate
furst
where

john

brought
the
news
furst
who
dared
commit
so
horrible
a
deed
stauffacher
the
doer
makes
the
deed
more
dreadful
still
it
was
his
nephew
his
own
brother
child
duke
john
of
austria
who
struck
the
blow
melchthal
what
drove
him
to
so
dire
a
parricide
stauffacher
the
emperor
kept
his
patrimony
back
despite
his
urgent
importunities
said
indeed
he
never
meant
to
give
it
but
with
a
mitre
to
appease
the
duke
however
this
may
be
the
duke
gave
ear
to
the
ill
counsel
of
his
friends
in
arms
and
with
the
noble
lords
von
eschenbach
von
tegerfeld
von
wart
and
palm
resolved
since
his
demands
for
justice
were
despised
with
his
own
hands
to
take
revenge
at
least
furst
but
say
how
compassed
he
the
dreadful
deed
stauffacher
the
king
was
riding
down
from
stein
to
baden
upon
his
way
to
join
the
court
at
rheinfeld
with
him
a
train
of
gentlemen
and
the
young
princes
john
and
leopold
and
when
they
reached
the
ferry
of
the
reuss
the
assassins
forced
their
way
into
the
boat
to
separate
the
emperor
from
his
suite
his
highness
landed
and
was
riding
on
across
a
field
where
once
they
say
a
mighty
city
stood
in
pagan
times
with
hapsburg
ancient
turrets
full
in
sight
where
all
the
grandeur
of
his
line
had
birth
when
duke
john
plunged
a
dagger
in
his
throat
palm
ran
him
through
the
body
with
his
lance
eschenbach
cleft
his
skull
at
one
fell
blow
and
down
he
sank
all
weltering
in
his
blood
on
his
own
soil
by
his
own
kinsmen
slain
those
on
the
opposite
bank
who
saw
the
deed
being
parted
by
the
stream
could
only
raise
an
unavailing
cry
of
loud
lament
but
a
poor
woman
sitting
by
the
way
raised
him
and
on
her
breast
he
bled
to
death
melchthal
thus
has
he
dug
his
own
untimely
grave
who
sought
insatiably
to
grasp
at
all
stauffacher
the
country
round
is
filled
with
dire
alarm
the
mountain

are
blockaded

the
hungarian
queen
to
all
her
sex

a
stranger
armed
with
the
thunders
of

wreak
dire
vengeance

whole
race
of
those
that
murdered
him
upon

servants

may
melchthal

you
which
way
the
murderers
have
fled
stauffacher
no
sooner
had
they
done
the
deed
than
they
took
flight
each
following
a
different
route
and
parted
to
see
each
other
more
duke
john
must
still
be
wandering
in
the
mountains

and
thus
their
crime
has
yielded
them
no
fruits
revenge
is
barren
of
itself
it
makes
the
dreadful
food
it
feeds
on
its
delight
is
murder
its
satiety

stauffacher
the
assassins
reap
no
profit
by
their
crime
but
we
shall
pluck
with
unpolluted
hands
the
teeming
fruits
of
their
most
bloody
deed
for
we
are
ransomed
from
our
heaviest
fear
the
direst
foe
of
liberty
has
fallen
and
is
reported
that
the
crown
will
pass

we
stood
so
stanchly
by

now
we
may
hope
for
justice
and
with

therefore
she
relies
that

in

lend

rather
that
they
loyally
assist
to
give
them
up
to

they
of

indeed
received

what
have
we
to
boast
of
from
the
son
did
he
confirm
the
charter
of
our
freedom
as
all
preceding
emperors
had
done
did
he
judge
righteous
judgment
or
afford
shelter
or
stay
to
innocence
oppressed
nay
did
he
give
audience
to
the
envoys
we
sent
to
lay
our
grievances
before
him
not
one
of
all
these
things
did
the

had
we
not
ourselves
achieved
our
rights
by
resolute
valor
our
necessities
had
never
touched
him
gratitude
to
him
within
these
vales
he
sowed
not
gratitude
he
stood
upon
an
eminence
he
might
have
been
a
very
father
to
his
people
but
all
his
aim
and
pleasure
was
to
raise
himself
and
his
own
house
and
now
may
those
whom
he
has
aggrandized
lament
for
him
furst
we
will
not
triumph
in
his
fall
nor
now
recall
to
mind
the
wrongs
we
have
endured
far
from
us
yet
that
we
should
avenge
the
sovereign
death
who
never
did
us
good
and
hunt
down
those
who
molested
us
becomes
us
not
nor

must
bring
its
offerings
free

unconstrained
from
all
enforced
duties
death
absolves
and
unto
him
we
are
no

bound

the

laments
within

in

his
