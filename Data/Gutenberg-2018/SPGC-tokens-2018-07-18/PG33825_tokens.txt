the
magnificent
an
atheist
manifesto
many
ask
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
man
believes
in
a
god
or
not
it
makes
a
big
difference
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
it
is
the
difference
between
being
right
and
being
wrong
it
is
the
difference
between
truth
and
surmises
facts
or
delusion
it
is
the
difference
between
the
earth
being
flat
and
the
earth
being
round
it
is
the
difference
between
the
earth
being
the
center
of
the
universe
or
a
tiny
speck
in
this
vast
and
uncharted
sea
of
multitudinous
suns
and
galaxies
it
is
the
difference
in
the
proper
concept
of
life
or
conclusions
based
upon
illusion
it
is
the
difference
between
verified
knowledge
and
the
faith
of
religion
it
is
a
question
of
progress
or
the
dark
ages
the
history
of
man
proves
that
religion
perverts
man
concept
of
life
and
the
universe
and
has
made
him
a
cringing
coward
before
the
blind
forces
of
nature
if
you
believe
that
there
is
a
god
that
man
was
created
that
he
was
forbidden
to
eat
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
that
he
disobeyed
that
he
is
a
fallen
angel
that
he
is
paying
the
penalty
for
his
sins
then
you
devote
your
time
praying
to
appease
an
angry
and
jealous
god
if
on
the
other
hand
you
believe
that
the
universe
is
a
great
mystery
that
man
is
the
product
of
evolution
that
he
is
born
without
knowledge
that
intelligence
comes
from
experience
then
you
devote
your
time
and
energies
to
improving
his
condition
with
the
hope
of
securing
a
little
happiness
here
for
yourself
and
your
fellow
man
that
is
the
difference
if
man
was
created
then
someone
made
a
grievous
mistake
it
is
inconceivable
that
any
form
of
intelligence
would
waste
so
much
time
and
effort
to
make
such
an
inferior
piece
of
life
with
all
the
ills
that
flesh
is
heir
to
and
with
all
the
misery
and
suffering
that
is
so
essential
a
part
of
living
if
man
is
a
fallen
angel
by
the
commission
of
a
sin
then
disease
and
sorrow
are
part
of
god
inscrutable
plan
as
a
penalty
imposed
upon
him
for
his
disobedience
and
man
entire
life
is
devoted
to
the
expiation
of
that
sin
so
as
to
soften
the
indictment
before
the
throne
of
god
man
atonement
consists
in
making
himself
as
miserable
as
possible
by
praying
fasting
masochism
flagellations
and
other
forms
of
torture
this
sadistic
delusion
causes
him
to
insist
that
others
under
pain
of
punishment
be
as
miserable
as
himself
for
fear
that
if
others
fail
to
do
as
he
does
it
will
provoke
the
wrath
of
his
tyrant
god
to
a
more
severe
chastisement
the
inevitable
result
is
that
man
devotes
his
life
not
to
the
essentials
of
living
and
the
making
of
a
happy
home
but
to
the
building
of
temples
and
churches
where
he
can
lift
his
voice
to
god
in
a
frenzy
of
fanaticism
and
eventually
he
becomes
a
victim
of
hysteria
his
time
and
energy
are
wasted
to
cleanse
his
soul
which
he
does
not
possess
and
to
save
himself
from
a
future
punishment
in
hell
which
exists
only
in
his
imagination
religious
hallucinations
take
on
many
forms
some
do
not
wash
themselves
some
wash
only
their
fingers
some
think
that
the
filthier
they
are
the
holier
they
are
some
cut
off
their
hair
while
others
let
it
grow
long
some
refuse
to
stand
up
while
others
refuse
to
sit
down
some
amputate
their
genitals
and
some
their
breasts
some
pull
out
their
teeth
and
others
wither
their
limbs
some
fast
and
others
gorge
themselves
some
cover
their
heads
with
sand
and
others
with
sackcloth
and
ashes
some
talk
continuously
and
others
remain
silent
some
are
celibates
and
others
are
profligates
some
stand
on
their
heads
some
brand
themselves
while
others
pierce
their
nose
eyes
and
ears
nuns
cut
off
their
hair
to
make
themselves
as
unsightly
as
possible
to
make
themselves
repulsive
to
the
opposite
sex
there
are
monks
who
have
vowed
never
to
look
upon
the
face
of
a
woman
and
franciscans
still
wear
ropes
around
their
bodies
as
a
symbol
of
flagellation
there
is
hardly
a
form
of
insanity
or
delusion
that
has
not
been
induced
by
some
sort
of
religious
belief
to
laugh
on
the
sabbath
at
one
time
was
considered
the
sin
of
sins
how
rightfully
robert
ingersoll
said
that
christianity
has
made
more
lunatics
than
it
ever
provided
asylums
for
on
the
other
hand
we
do
not
believe
that
man
is
a
depraved
human
being
we
do
not
believe
that
there
is
a
tyrant
god
or
that
there
is
a
hell
and
that
man
will
suffer
the
pains
and
penalties
of
eternal
torment
we
do
not
believe
that
you
should
make
yourself
as
miserable
as
possible
here
in
the
hope
of
securing
some
happiness
hereafter
we
do
not
believe
that
disease
is
a
punishment
for
sin
we
believe
that
disease
is
a
natural
consequence
of
the
processes
of
life
and
that
the
ills
of
the
flesh
inevitably
follow
where
one
form
of
life
lives
upon
another
and
where
at
the
banquet
of
life
each
in
turn
is
a
guest
and
a
dish
it
is
only
by
understanding
the
nature
of
disease
that
man
has
been
able
even
in
a
small
degree
to
protect
himself
from
the
ravages
of
its
destruction
the
use
of
prayer
to
cure
disease
has
been
responsible
for
epidemics
that
have
on
many
occasions
almost
wiped
out
the
human
race
prayer
has
had
no
more
effect
upon
disease
than
it
has
upon
health
it
merely
permits
the
disease
to
continue
its
course
and
increase
the
suffering
of
the
victim
if
priests
of
all
clans
were
free
of
disease
and
immune
to
death
then
there
might
be
some
basis
for
the
claim
of
the
religionists
but
these
men
of
god
are
victims
of
the
natural
course
of
life
even
as
you
and
i
they
enjoy
no
exemptions
they
suffer
the
same
ills
they
feel
the
same
sensations
they
are
subject
to
the
same
passions
of
the
body
the
same
frailties
of
the
mind
are
victims
of
circumstances
and
misfortune
and
they
meet
inevitable
death
just
as
every
other
person
they
commit
the
same
kind
of
crimes
as
other
mortals
and
especially
because
of
their
calling
many
are
notoriously
involved
in
the
embezzlement
of
church
funds
nor
does
their
calling
protect
them
from
the
passions
of
the
flesh
the
scandalous
conduct
of
many
men
of
the
cloth
in
the
realm
of
moral
turpitude
often
ends
in
murder
that
is
why
there
are
so
many
men
of
god
in
our
jails
and
why
so
many
have
paid
the
supreme
penalty
in
the
death
chair
they
are
not
free
from
a
single
rule
of
life
what
others
must
endure
they
likewise
must
experience
they
can
not
protect
themselves
from
the
forces
of
nature
and
the
laws
of
life
any
more
than
you
can
what
they
can
do
you
can
do
too
their
claims
of
being
anointed
and
vicars
of
god
on
earth
are
false
and
hypocritical
if
they
can
not
fulfill
their
promises
while
you
are
alive
how
can
they
accomplish
them
when
you
are
dead
if
they
are
impotent
here
where
they
could
demonstrate
their
powers
how
ridiculous
are
their
promises
to
accomplish
them
in
the
hereafter
the
mythical
abode
which
exists
only
in
their
dishonest
or
deluded
imagination
the
illusions
of
life
are
many
and
varied
things
are
not
always
what
they
seem
to
be
and
it
is
well
known
that
appearances
are
deceiving
that
is
why
it
is
so
difficult
for
some
people
to
understand
the
nature
of
disease
and
why
it
has
taken
man
so
long
to
comprehend
the
true
conditions
of
life
this
deception
prevails
in
matters
of
great
importance
as
well
as
in
matters
of
little
consequence
there
is
no
voice
of
nature
to
tell
man
that
which
is
true
and
that
which
is
false
nor
to
warn
him
of
the
dangers
of
life
he
must
find
the
truth
for
himself
and
only
after
very
bitter
experiences
the
first
piece
of
deception
of
man
after
his
mental
awakening
was
his
inability
to
conceive
of
any
scheme
of
life
except
from
his
own
primitive
concept
of
limited
intelligence
he
could
not
conceive
the
earth
and
the
universe
except
as
being
created
and
from
his
own
feeling
of
revenge
he
could
not
conceive
of
the
suffering
of
life
except
as
a
punishment
for
some
disobedience
primitive
though
he
be
he
did
not
inflict
pain
and
punishment
upon
the
innocent
this
diabolical
scheme
could
only
come
from
a
merciful
god
as
an
illustration
of
this
concept
of
primitive
man
in
this
respect
is
the
delusion
he
experiences
when
he
believes
that
the
sun
rises
and
sets
when
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
the
sun
which
is
stationary
as
far
as
the
earth
is
concerned
and
it
is
the
earth
that
moves
as
galileo
so
courageously
maintained
at
the
cost
of
his
liberty
there
is
a
delusion
that
the
sun
shines
and
the
water
falls
from
the
clouds
to
make
the
flowers
bloom
to
the
religionist
this
is
an
indication
of
the
beauty
in
nature
it
is
nothing
of
the
kind
poisonous
plants
and
obnoxious
weeds
are
equally
nourished
by
the
warmth
of
the
sun
and
the
moisture
of
the
water
is
this
then
an
indication
of
the
ugliness
of
nature
certainly
not
both
are
inevitable
consequences
of
the
environment
in
which
they
live
it
could
not
be
otherwise
is
the
hippopotamus
one
of
nature
masterpieces
is
its
face
and
form
the
perfection
of
beauty
and
grace
would
you
consider
this
animal
a
work
of
living
art
if
you
were
responsible
for
it
and
yet
if
this
beast
could
talk
it
would
probably
say
that
its
environment
was
made
for
its
benefit
and
that
its
marvelous
features
particularly
its
mouth
was
especially
designed
for
its
enjoyment
and
that
its
whole
body
was
made
in
the
image
and
likeness
of
god
the
fact
that
the
hippopotamus
has
survived
these
millions
of
years
of
the
evolutionary
process
and
still
thrives
today
is
proof
that
it
is
equally
as
favored
by
nature
as
is
man
to
nature
the
blossoms
of
the
flowers
and
the
obnoxious
weeds
are
identical
and
the
fragrance
of
the
one
and
the
stench
of
the
other
are
equally
alike
both
if
they
could
talk
would
boast
of
preference
for
them
while
as
a
matter
of
fact
both
would
be
wrong
the
sun
does
not
shine
to
bring
us
its
necessary
light
and
warmth
without
also
bringing
to
light
some
new
burden
for
our
overtroubled
hearts
to
bear
and
everything
in
the
universe
shares
the
same
and
inevitable
consequences
while
it
is
true
that
it
is
an
ill
wind
that
blows
no
good
it
is
also
true
that
what
is
one
man
meat
is
another
man
poison
to
nature
matters
of
great
importance
and
matters
of
little
consequence
are
on
an
equal
basis
the
one
is
not
favored
above
the
other
it
is
the
survival
of
the
fittest
and
not
the
most
desirable
that
survives
when
conditions
are
favorable
to
the
wild
animals
they
thrive
by
killing
the
other
forms
of
life
upon
which
they
live
and
when
conditions
are
favorable
to
man
he
kills
and
lives
upon
the
forms
of
life
which
he
considers
exist
solely
for
his
pleasure
and
benefit
to
nature
the
germs
of
disease
as
a
form
of
life
are
equally
as
important
as
the
other
forms
of
life
that
breathe
and
have
their
being
when
conditions
are
favorable
to
the
virus
of
influenza
and
pneumonia
we
have
what
is
known
as
an
epidemic
and
when
conditions
are
favorable
to
the
growth
of
cancer
it
has
what
we
might
term
a
roman
holiday
by
destroying
a
third
of
our
population
germs
of
disease
are
merely
invisible
wild
animals
they
are
forms
of
life
that
thrive
upon
the
soil
of
the
human
body
prayer
has
about
as
much
effect
upon
them
as
it
would
have
upon
the
hungry
tiger
ready
to
devour
you
a
bullet
from
a
gun
would
be
far
more
effective
against
the
tiger
and
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
the
germs
of
disease
and
the
discovery
of
the
methods
of
destroying
them
are
comparable
to
the
invention
of
the
gun
and
its
use
against
the
ferocious
animal
the
knowledge
of
the
one
protects
you
against
the
invisible
enemies
of
destruction
while
the
invention
of
the
gun
protects
you
against
being
destroyed
by
the
wild
beasts
the
germs
of
disease
and
the
hungry
tiger
are
both
determined
upon
the
same
objective
your
destruction
one
by
eating
you
in
chunks
and
the
other
by
minutely
gnawing
you
away
piecemeal
the
results
are
identical
it
is
not
necessary
to
moralize
upon
the
difference
but
this
we
know
that
in
our
present
scheme
of
life
as
ingersoll
so
eloquently
states
the
hands
that
help
are
better
far
than
lips
that
pray
our
bodies
are
as
much
meat
for
the
disease
germs
that
eat
us
as
the
animal
that
furnishes
the
meat
for
our
appetites
or
as
shakespeare
puts
it
in
the
sweetest
bud
the
eating
canker
dwells
in
a
broader
and
more
comprehensive
concept
of
disease
shakespeare
says
it
is
as
if
a
god
omnipotent
is
mustering
in
his
clouds
armies
of
pestilence
and
they
shall
strike
your
children
yet
unborn
and
unbegot
who
are
you
to
say
which
one
is
the
more
favored
in
this
scheme
of
life
the
germs
of
disease
or
man
which
one
is
preferred
by
nature
which
one
is
more
important
than
the
other
since
the
ends
accomplished
are
the
same
the
life
of
the
disease
germ
came
into
existence
by
the
same
process
as
did
the
life
of
man
it
is
just
as
much
a
part
of
nature
as
is
the
dimpled
babe
if
we
can
not
live
without
sunshine
and
water
neither
can
the
germs
of
disease
it
might
well
be
that
we
are
nothing
more
than
disease
germs
in
the
environment
in
which
we
live
the
same
basic
construction
by
which
they
live
forms
the
same
pattern
upon
which
our
life
is
built
to
nature
the
night
is
just
as
important
as
the
day
and
the
life
of
the
germ
we
call
disease
is
as
important
as
the
life
of
the
body
upon
which
it
feeds
it
follows
the
same
law
of
life
it
is
born
reproduces
and
dies
there
are
forms
of
life
that
live
by
night
that
are
equally
as
favored
by
nature
as
those
which
live
by
day
freaks
of
all
kinds
exist
in
nature
from
the
utterly
ridiculous
to
the
terrifying
monstrosities
this
is
proof
of
the
lack
of
design
in
nature
as
far
as
man
is
concerned
when
man
comes
to
the
realization
that
he
is
not
the
favorite
of
god
that
he
was
not
specially
created
that
the
universe
was
not
made
for
his
benefit
and
that
he
is
subject
to
the
same
laws
of
nature
as
all
other
forms
of
life
then
and
not
until
then
will
he
understand
that
he
must
rely
upon
himself
and
himself
alone
for
whatever
benefits
he
is
to
enjoy
and
devote
his
time
and
energies
to
helping
himself
and
his
fellow
men
to
meet
the
exigencies
of
life
and
to
set
about
to
solve
the
difficult
and
intricate
problems
of
living
the
recognition
of
a
problem
is
the
first
step
to
its
solution
we
are
not
fallen
angels
nor
were
we
created
perfect
on
the
contrary
we
are
the
product
of
millions
of
years
of
an
unpurposed
evolution
we
are
the
descendants
and
inheritors
of
all
the
defects
of
our
primitive
ancestry
the
evolution
of
the
myriad
forms
of
life
from
the
infinitesimal
to
the
mammoth
from
the
worm
to
the
dinosaur
the
most
important
step
in
the
development
of
man
is
the
recognition
of
the
fact
that
we
are
born
without
knowledge
and
that
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
is
a
slow
and
painful
process
if
all
man
needed
upon
earth
was
a
knowledge
of
god
then
why
the
necessity
of
establishing
educational
institutions
unless
a
child
is
taught
to
talk
it
will
never
be
able
to
speak
the
language
of
our
tongue
without
teaching
the
child
the
rudiments
of
speech
he
would
be
unable
to
communicate
his
thoughts
to
others
without
proper
training
his
grunts
of
expression
would
be
meaningless
and
the
only
way
he
could
express
himself
would
be
by
the
primitive
instinct
of
making
signs
and
by
pointing
the
brain
needs
the
same
kind
of
training
as
any
other
part
of
the
body
that
requires
exercise
for
development
nourishment
for
the
mind
is
just
as
necessary
as
nourishment
for
the
body
just
as
there
are
some
foods
which
have
been
so
adulterated
and
refined
that
when
eaten
they
add
no
nourishment
to
the
body
so
there
are
truths
which
have
been
adulterated
by
religion
and
superstition
so
as
to
be
utterly
valueless
in
nourishing
the
mind
with
intelligence
education
becomes
the
primary
object
of
civilization
as
thomas
paine
says
wisdom
is
not
the
purchase
of
a
day
the
church
knows
that
an
educated
man
is
an
unbeliever
that
is
why
there
is
a
continual
struggle
on
the
part
of
the
clergy
to
adulterate
education
with
superstition
to
maintain
their
untenable
position
they
must
keep
the
people
shackled
to
a
form
of
mental
slavery
both
fear
and
superstition
are
forms
of
a
contagious
disease
the
ignorance
of
man
produced
natural
fears
of
the
elements
of
nature
what
he
could
not
understand
he
attributed
to
malevolent
spirits
whose
primary
purpose
was
to
punish
and
harm
him
under
this
spell
it
seems
almost
incredible
that
he
ever
advanced
from
his
state
of
primitive
ignorance
his
fears
produced
such
fantastic
monsters
of
the
air
that
it
was
first
necessary
to
relieve
his
tormented
mind
of
these
terrifying
myths
of
ghosts
and
gods
before
he
was
able
to
acquire
even
the
simplest
rudiments
of
knowledge
man
ignorance
and
fears
made
him
an
easy
prey
of
priests
his
gullibility
was
such
that
he
believed
everything
he
was
told
he
soon
became
a
slave
to
these
liars
and
hypocrites
and
what
did
the
priests
tell
him
they
told
him
that
god
had
made
a
special
revelation
in
a
book
called
the
bible
and
that
it
was
necessary
to
believe
every
word
in
that
book
in
order
that
he
might
save
his
soul
they
told
him
that
if
he
disobeyed
their
commands
he
would
suffer
eternal
damnation
in
a
hell
where
the
fire
never
ceases
and
where
the
worm
never
dies
they
also
told
him
that
it
was
a
sin
for
him
to
read
that
book
and
that
the
priest
was
especially
ordained
by
god
to
interpret
the
meaning
of
each
and
every
word
and
what
was
the
priest
interpretation
of
the
text
of
that
book
it
was
that
man
was
a
corrupt
and
sinful
being
and
that
in
order
to
be
saved
from
punishment
after
death
he
had
to
give
a
substantial
part
of
the
fruits
of
his
labor
to
the
priest
to
pray
for
him
and
intercede
with
god
on
his
behalf
so
as
to
mitigate
the
punishment
to
which
he
had
already
been
doomed
what
a
diabolical
scheme
of
fraud
by
which
to
live
upon
the
sweat
and
labor
of
others
it
was
such
a
profitable
scheme
that
the
priests
began
to
maintain
their
power
by
the
force
of
arms
as
a
result
there
came
into
existence
the
twin
tyrannies
of
church
and
state
it
seems
incredible
that
such
nonsense
was
ever
imposed
upon
suffering
humanity
and
nonsense
it
would
be
were
it
not
so
tragic
so
fearful
did
he
become
that
he
thought
that
he
could
not
live
without
the
protection
of
the
priests
and
as
ingersoll
said
as
long
as
people
wanted
popes
plenty
of
hypocrites
will
be
found
to
take
their
place
ingersoll
further
declared
the
priests
pretended
to
stand
between
the
wrath
of
the
gods
and
the
helplessness
of
man
he
was
man
attorney
at
the
court
of
heaven
he
carried
to
the
invisible
world
a
flag
of
truce
a
protest
and
a
request
he
came
back
with
a
command
with
authority
and
power
man
fell
upon
his
knees
before
his
own
servant
and
the
priest
taking
advantage
of
the
awe
inspired
by
his
supposed
influence
with
the
gods
made
of
his
a
cringing
hypocrite
and
slave
as
long
as
there
is
one
person
suffering
an
injustice
as
long
as
one
person
is
forced
to
bear
an
unnecessary
sorrow
as
long
as
one
person
is
subject
to
an
undeserved
pain
the
worship
of
a
god
is
a
demoralizing
humiliation
as
long
as
there
is
one
mistake
in
the
universe
as
long
as
one
wrong
is
permitted
to
exist
as
long
as
there
is
hatred
and
antagonism
among
mankind
the
existence
of
a
god
is
a
moral
impossibility
ingersoll
said
injustice
upon
earth
renders
the
justice
of
heaven
impossible
man
inhumanity
to
man
will
continue
as
long
as
man
loves
god
more
than
he
loves
his
fellow
man
the
love
of
god
means
wasted
love
for
god
and
country
means
a
divided
allegiance
a
per
cent
patriot
the
most
abused
word
in
the
language
of
man
is
the
word
god
the
reason
for
this
is
that
it
is
subject
to
so
much
abuse
there
is
no
other
word
in
the
human
language
that
is
as
meaningless
and
incapable
of
explanation
as
is
the
word
god
it
is
the
beginning
and
end
of
nothing
it
is
the
alpha
and
omega
of
ignorance
it
has
as
many
meanings
as
there
are
minds
and
as
each
person
has
an
opinion
of
what
the
word
god
ought
to
mean
it
is
a
word
without
premise
without
foundation
and
without
substance
it
is
without
validity
it
is
all
things
to
all
people
and
is
as
meaningless
as
it
is
indefinable
it
is
the
most
dangerous
in
the
hands
of
the
unscrupulous
and
is
the
joker
that
trumps
the
ace
it
is
the
poisoned
word
that
has
paralyzed
the
brain
of
man
the
fear
of
the
lord
is
not
the
beginning
of
wisdom
on
the
contrary
it
has
made
man
a
groveling
slave
it
has
made
raving
lunatics
of
those
who
have
attempted
to
interpret
what
god
is
and
what
is
supposed
to
be
our
duty
to
god
it
has
made
man
prostitute
the
most
precious
things
of
life
it
has
made
him
sacrifice
wife
and
child
and
home
in
the
name
of
god
means
in
the
name
of
nothing
it
has
caused
man
to
be
a
wastrel
with
the
precious
elixir
of
life
because
there
is
no
god
ingersoll
could
not
understand
the
mind
of
those
who
once
having
been
told
the
truth
preferred
to
remain
under
the
spell
of
superstition
and
in
ignorance
he
could
not
understand
why
people
would
not
accept
new
truths
with
gladness
he
also
knew
however
that
once
a
person
mind
had
been
poisoned
with
religious
superstition
it
was
almost
impossible
to
free
it
from
the
paralyzing
fear
which
destroyed
its
ability
to
think
it
is
now
established
by
verifiable
evidence
that
religion
stultifies
the
brain
and
is
the
great
obstacle
in
the
path
of
intellectual
progress
the
more
religious
a
person
is
the
more
he
is
steeped
in
ignorance
and
superstition
the
less
is
his
sense
of
moral
responsibility
the
more
intelligent
a
person
the
less
religious
he
is
there
is
an
old
saying
that
where
there
are
three
scientists
there
are
two
atheists
the
countries
whose
governments
are
dominated
by
religion
and
religious
institutions
are
the
most
backward
by
the
same
token
the
countries
whose
people
are
the
most
enlightened
and
whose
governments
are
based
upon
the
principle
of
secularism
the
separation
of
church
and
state
are
the
most
progressive
and
let
me
tell
you
when
man
is
intellectually
free
the
progress
he
will
make
is
beyond
calculation
what
better
illustration
than
this
more
progress
has
been
made
since
the
declaration
of
independence
and
the
american
revolution
than
was
made
in
the
previous
five
thousand
years
yes
more
intellectual
and
material
progress
has
been
made
by
man
since
the
establishment
of
the
american
republic
than
during
all
the
intervening
years
from
the
pharaohs
of
egypt
up
to
and
including
the
time
of
the
grandeur
that
was
greece
and
the
glory
that
was
rome
and
there
is
a
good
and
valid
reason
for
this
it
was
because
in
our
fathers
retired
the
gods
from
politics
the
basic
principle
of
the
american
republic
is
the
freedom
of
man
in
society
the
declaration
of
independence
was
the
product
of
intellectual
emancipation
and
that
is
why
from
thenceforth
our
date
of
existence
should
be
recorded
not
from
the
mythical
birth
of
jesus
christ
but
from
the
day
of
our
independence
this
should
be
the
year
one
hundred
and
in
our
calendar
despite
discouraging
signs
here
and
there
the
seeds
of
freedom
planted
by
the
american
revolution
will
take
root
and
throughout
the
world
if
man
will
learn
to
zealously
guard
his
freedom
peace
and
progress
will
come
to
all
the
world
could
there
be
a
more
significant
illustration
than
this
practically
in
our
own
lifetime
and
certainly
since
the
declaration
of
independence
man
has
wrought
the
most
amazing
achievements
in
the
field
of
science
and
progress
ever
recorded
in
human
history
not
in
their
order
nor
according
to
their
significance
do
i
record
the
following
anesthesia
was
discovered
do
you
know
what
it
means
to
relieve
man
of
his
pain
and
suffering
anesthesia
is
the
most
humane
of
all
of
man
accomplishments
and
what
a
merciful
accomplishment
it
was
for
this
great
discovery
we
are
indebted
to
morton
do
you
know
that
the
religionists
opposed
the
use
of
anesthesia
on
the
ground
that
god
sent
pain
as
a
punishment
for
sin
and
it
was
considered
the
greatest
of
sacrileges
to
use
it
just
think
of
it
a
sin
to
relieve
man
of
his
misery
what
a
monstrous
perversion
this
one
instance
alone
should
convince
you
of
the
difference
in
believing
in
god
or
not
no
believer
in
god
would
have
spent
his
energies
to
discover
anesthesia
he
would
have
been
in
mortal
fear
of
the
wrath
of
his
god
for
interfering
with
his
divine
plan
of
making
man
suffer
for
having
eaten
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
the
very
crux
of
the
matter
is
in
this
one
instance
man
seeks
to
relieve
his
fellow
man
from
the
suffering
of
disease
and
the
pangs
of
mental
agony
the
believers
in
god
are
content
that
suffering
is
ordained
and
therefore
he
accepts
life
and
its
trials
and
tribulations
as
a
penance
for
living
the
fear
of
the
wrath
of
god
has
been
a
stumbling
block
to
progress
when
james
young
simpson
sought
to
apply
anesthesia
to
a
woman
in
childbirth
the
clergymen
of
his
day
foamed
at
the
mouth
and
spat
upon
him
with
vituperation
and
abuse
for
attempting
to
violate
god
direct
command
that
in
pain
thou
shalt
bring
forth
children
as
based
upon
the
idiotic
text
of
the
bible
but
simpson
persisted
despite
the
ravings
of
the
religious
lunatics
of
his
day
the
importance
of
simpson
application
of
anesthesia
to
the
relief
of
pain
in
childbirth
and
his
open
defiance
of
the
religionists
are
beyond
the
measure
of
words
to
evaluate
the
was
discovered
in
our
time
professor
wilhelm
roentgen
deserves
our
everlasting
debt
of
gratitude
for
this
contribution
its
application
alone
in
the
field
of
medicine
makes
it
one
of
the
greatest
contributions
to
the
service
of
man
karl
lansteiner
discovery
of
the
composition
of
the
blood
made
in
our
time
has
been
responsible
for
the
saving
of
countless
thousands
of
lives
blood
was
also
feared
by
the
religionists
and
a
taboo
was
placed
upon
all
those
who
touched
it
as
being
contaminated
even
the
dissection
of
the
human
body
was
prohibited
by
religion
the
study
of
human
anatomy
is
within
our
own
time
and
the
fruitful
results
of
this
scientific
exploring
of
man
physical
structure
are
incalculable
it
is
needless
i
think
to
tell
you
why
the
study
of
human
body
is
so
recent
until
the
emancipation
of
the
mind
of
man
from
the
thraldom
and
shackles
of
religion
it
was
taught
and
believed
as
a
religious
truth
and
maintained
under
penalty
of
eternal
damnation
that
if
the
human
body
was
dissected
god
would
not
be
able
to
recognize
you
on
the
day
of
resurrection
such
has
been
the
paralyzing
menace
of
religion
that
has
prevailed
over
the
mind
of
man
the
discovery
of
the
chemistry
of
food
and
its
application
to
nutrition
has
contributed
more
to
the
health
of
the
human
race
than
all
the
gods
clergymen
and
priests
since
the
dawn
of
existence
preventive
medicine
has
accomplished
amazing
results
in
bringing
health
to
and
prolonging
the
life
of
the
people
hygiene
and
its
application
have
saved
millions
upon
millions
from
disease
and
premature
death
it
has
stayed
the
hand
of
god
in
his
madness
in
spreading
deaths
from
epidemics
of
disease
charles
darwin
published
his
origin
of
species
and
the
great
principle
of
evolution
was
promulgated
modern
emancipated
medicine
has
reduced
the
infant
death
rate
by
more
than
per
cent
and
has
been
responsible
for
more
than
doubling
the
life
span
of
man
within
the
past
century
just
think
of
it
all
of
this
within
our
own
lifetime
all
of
this
and
more
since
the
day
of
american
independence
and
listen
to
these
words
of
paul
white
founder
of
the
american
heart
association
he
said
those
of
us
doctors
who
graduated
from
medical
school
thirty
to
forty
years
ago
look
back
now
at
the
almost
unbelievable
ignorance
about
heart
disease
that
then
existed
knowledge
has
come
since
then
than
had
been
acquired
in
all
the
centuries
italics
mine
man
was
taught
in
the
past
that
the
heart
like
the
voice
was
the
gift
of
god
and
it
was
too
sacred
for
man
to
probe
into
its
workings
what
were
the
results
millions
died
who
could
have
been
saved
millions
lived
as
horrible
cripples
who
could
have
lived
a
normal
life
if
man
in
the
past
had
had
the
courage
that
he
has
today
to
seek
relief
from
the
terrors
of
disease
such
is
the
amazing
progress
that
has
been
made
when
man
relies
upon
his
own
efforts
to
solve
his
problems
whether
they
concern
his
health
or
his
social
or
political
affairs
it
was
only
within
the
past
forty
years
that
james
herrick
properly
diagnosed
the
cause
of
coronary
thrombosis
from
which
followed
the
amazing
progress
that
has
since
been
attained
in
combating
this
greatest
of
killers
i
for
one
wish
to
place
upon
the
brow
of
herrick
my
laurel
leaf
of
thanks
for
his
great
accomplishment
in
medicine
what
wonders
have
been
accomplished
since
the
invention
of
the
steam
engine
the
automobile
radio
television
electronic
devises
and
the
thousand
and
one
other
discoveries
and
inventions
too
numerous
to
mention
the
educational
benefit
of
the
motion
picture
will
far
outstrip
its
entertainment
value
and
its
use
in
nearly
every
department
of
learning
makes
it
one
of
man
most
valuable
inventions
think
of
benjamin
franklin
discovery
of
the
relationship
of
electricity
and

and
the
condemnation
heaped
upon
him
for
his
defiance
of
the
prince

the
power
of

and
of
the

penalty
they
were
to
suffer
for

into
the
face
of

and
sewing
machines
the
mechanical
weaving
of
cloth
and
the
myriad
uses
of
electric
and
atomic
power
will
make
man
the
master
of
his
destiny
once
he
frees
himself
from
the
myth
of
a
tyrant
god
ingersoll
best
expressed
man
inventions
and
their
uses
when
he
said
that
science
took
the
thunderbolt
from
the
gods
and
in
the
electric
spark
freedom
with
thought
with
intelligence
and
with
love
sweeps
under
all
the
waves
of
the
sea
science
free
thought
took
a
tear
from
the
cheek
of
unpaid
labor
converted
it
into
steam
and
created
the
giant
that
turns
with
tireless
arms
the
countless
wheels
of
toil
deprive
man
of
the
use
of
his
discoveries
and
inventions
of
the
past
century
and
he
will
think
he
has
been
returned
to
barbarism
look
what
thomas
edison
invention
of
the
electric
light
did
for
man
it
lengthened
his
life
it
gave
more
hours
to
the
day
and
increased
his
comforts
beyond
anything
previously
known
or
imagined
and
added
immeasurably
to
his
joy
of
living
even
joshua
fictitious
performance
of
stopping
the
sun
and
the
moon
fades
into
nothingness
when
compared
with
this
sublime
achievement
nor
must
we
forget
edison
invention
for
reproducing
the
human
voice
and
please
grant
me
a
moment
indulgence
to
say
that
i
had
the
great
honor
to
know
thomas
edison
and
edison
honored
me
by
calling
me
his
friend
if
printing
has
been
hailed
as
one
of
the
world
great
inventions
what
must
we
say
of
the
phonograph
while
printing
preserves
thoughts
on
paper
the
phonograph
preserves
not
only
his
thoughts
but
also
his
voice
the
song
of
the
skylark
is
no
longer
wasted
upon
the
desert
air
thomas
edison
the
greatest
of
human
benefactors
wrested
from
nature
her
most
guarded
secret
the
mystery
of
the
human
voice
he
disproved
as
it
was
once
believed
that
the
human
voice
like
the
heart
was
the
gift
of
god
he
demonstrated
that
the
human
voice
was
merely
the
natural
mechanism
of
sound
produced
by
air
of
the
lungs
passing
over
the
cords
of
the
throat
and
larynx
in
the
same
manner
as
are
sounds
produced
by
the
strings
of
a
musical
instrument
as
a
result
of
edison
invention
man
himself
has
already
produced
artificially
every
manifestation
of
the
human
voice
if
the
voice
was
part
of
god
plan
how
do
we
account
for
its
absence
in
the
giraffe
this
animal
has
no
larynx
and
therefore
no
vocal
cords
and
as
a
consequence
it
can
not
talk
or
make
sounds
with
its
throat
the
giraffe
is
proof
of
the
lack
of
design
in
nature
and
the
blindness
of
the
forces
of
evolutionary
life
to
list
all
the
great
discoveries
in
the
field
of
science
and
medicine
during
the
past
century
such
as
aspirin
insulin
penicillin
and
the
streptomycin
drugs
would
require
the
undivided
attention
of
a
medical
historian
and
a
veritable
encyclopedia
to
record
them
and
yet
there
are
still
many
diseases
that
plague
man
of
which
he
has
no
knowledge
they
eat
and
ravage
his
mind
and
body
with
excruciating
pain
and
torture
and
he
is
utterly
helpless
against
them
he
not
only
does
not
know
their
origin
but
has
not
the
slightest
inkling
of
their
nature
or
how
to
fortify
himself
against
their
attacks
he
must
sit
like
a
condemned
criminal
in
agonizing
torture
waiting
for
blessed
death
if
man
and
the
other
forms
of
life
upon
this
earth
are
a
mere
of
an
plan
of
a
supreme
intelligence
then
i
denounce
such
a
scheme
as
tyrannical
and
barbaric
why
should
we
be
made
to
suffer
such
excruciating
pains
and
penalties
of
life
to
satisfy
that
from
which
we
derive
no
benefit
and
where
death
negates
all
of
our
efforts
and
which
makes
the
purpose
of
life
our
hopes
and
desires
our
ambitions
and
aspirations
a
cruel
mockery
o
prayer
thy
name
is
failure
o
god
thou
art
a
cruel
myth
you
will
not
find
a
single
mention
of
these
great
humanitarian
achievements
in
the
book
of
books
not
a
single
reference
about
the
nature
and
cure
of
disease
not
a
word
regarding
those
inventions
that
have
so
mercifully
lifted
the
burden
of
toil
from
the
backs
of
labor
and
there
is
good
reason
for
it
the
biblical
writers
not
only
had
no
knowledge
of
these
things
but
they
had
a
perverted
concept
of
life
and
the
universe
their
concept
was
that
man
was
a
victim
of
blood
pollution
and
his
only
salvation
was
by
a
blood
atonement
i
remember
once
seeing
a
small
pamphlet
entitled
what
the
bible
teaches
about
morality
on
opening
the
little
booklet
it
was
discovered
to
be
nothing
but
blank
pages
another
such
pamphlet
might
very
appropriately
be
published
entitled
what
the
bible
reveals
about
disease
medicine
and
health
and
blank
pages
should
be
used
for
all
the
bible
contains
about
these
vital
subjects
on
the
contrary
these
benefits
have
been
denounced
by
the
believers
in
the
bible
and
by
the
representatives
of
the
bible
deity
as
being
contrary
to
god
plan
does
not
the
bible
plainly
state
that
only
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
is
man
to
labor
for
the
bread
he
eats
here
is
the
exact
biblical
quotation
in
the
sweat
of
thy
face
thou
shalt
eat
bread
and
why
only
because
he
sought
knowledge
and
does
not
the
bible
god
place
a
curse
upon
man
for
the
knowledge
that
has
been
such
a
solace
and
benefit
to
him
here
is
another
exact
biblical
quotation
cursed
be
the
ground
for
thy
sake
in
pain
thou
shalt
eat
of
it
all
the
days
of
thy
life
the
bible
is
a
lie
it
is
a
fake
and
a
fraud
i
denounce
this
book
and
its
god
i
hold
it
in
utter
detestation
every
man
and
woman
who
has
contributed
to
the
relief
of
the
pain
and
suffering
of
humanity
has
been
an
infidel
to
the
bible
god
every
new
invention
every
new
discovery
for
the
benefit
of
man
violates
these
biblical
edicts
i
say
seek
knowledge
defy
this
tyrant
god
it
is
your
only
salvation
it
is
because
of
the
biblical
curse
on
man
search
for
knowledge
which
has
so
paralyzed
his
mind
during
the
past
ages
and
its
detrimental
effect
upon
progress
that
makes
the
bible
the
most
wicked
the
most
detestable
the
most
pernicious
and
the
most
obnoxious
book
ever
published
it
has
been
a
curse
to
the
human
race
it
is
the
duty
of
every
brave
and
honest
man
and
woman
to
do
everything
in
his
and
her
power
to
destroy
the
influence
of
this
utterly
stupid
and
vicious
book
with
its
infantile
concept
of
life
and
its
nonsense
concerning
the
universe
it
is
their
duty
to
do
everything
within
their
power
to
stop
its
demoralizing
and
paralyzing
influence
upon
the
life
of
man
we
will
never
achieve
intellectual
liberty
until
the
wickedness
of
this
book
has
been
discarded
with
the
belief
in
the
flatness
of
the
earth
if
you
do
not
want
to
stop
the
wheels
of
progress
if
you
do
not
want
to
go
back
to
the
dark
ages
if
you
do
not
want
to
live
again
under
tyranny
then
you
must
guard
your
liberty
and
you
must
not
let
the
church
get
control
of
your
government
if
you
do
you
will
lose
the
greatest
legacy
ever
bequeathed
to
the
human
race
intellectual
freedom
now
let
me
tell
you
another
thing
if
all
the
energy
and
wealth
wasted
upon
religion
in
all
of
its
varied
forms
had
been
spent
to
understand
life
and
its
problems
we
would
today
be
living
under
conditions
that
would
seem
almost
like
utopia
most
of
our
social
and
domestic
problems
would
have
been
solved
and
equally
as
important
our
understanding
and
relations
with
the
other
peoples
of
the
world
would
have
by
now
brought
about
universal
peace
man
would
have
a
better
understanding
of
his
motives
and
actions
and
would
have
learned
to
curb
his
primitive
instincts
for
revenge
and
retaliation
he
would
by
now
know
that
wars
of
hate
aggression
and
aggrandizement
are
only
productive
of
more
hate
and
more
human
suffering
the
enlightened
and
completely
emancipated
man
from
the
fears
of
a
god
and
the
dogma
of
hate
and
revenge
would
make
him
a
brother
to
his
fellow
man
he
would
devote
his
energies
to
discoveries
and
inventions
which
theology
previously
condemned
as
a
defiance
of
god
but
which
have
proved
so
beneficial
to
him
he
would
no
longer
be
a
slave
to
a
god
and
live
in
cringing
fear
to
build
a
church
when
a
school
house
is
needed
is
to
perpetrate
a
theft
upon
education
to
build
a
church
when
a
hospital
is
needed
is
to
take
from
the
parched
lips
of
the
sick
the
cup
of
relief
and
from
the
suffering
the
merciful
hand
of
help
when
the
object
of
man
conduct
will
be
to
improve
the
conditions
of
his
fellow
man
and
not
the
appeasement
of
a
mythical
god
he
will
become
more
understanding
and
more
indulgent
of
the
frailties
mistakes
and
action
of
others
and
by
the
same
token
he
will
become
more
appreciative
of
their
efforts
he
will
develop
a
greater
consciousness
to
avoid
mistakes
and
to
prevent
injury
life
and
its
living
will
take
on
a
greater
significance
and
our
efforts
and
energies
will
be
devoted
to
creating
as
much
joy
and
happiness
as
possible
for
all
living
creatures
unless
death
is
made
a
lesson
for
the
living
the
life
lived
is
wasted
why
should
life
come
into
existence
only
to
be
destroyed
one
dies
and
another
is
born
for
what
a
few
miserable
hours
of
life
then
oblivion
with
this
recognition
of
the
finality
of
death
no
one
should
willingly
withhold
acts
that
would
bring
benefits
joy
or
happiness
to
others
in
death
the
hesitant
act
can
no
longer
be
performed
the
word
of
praise
is
as
impossible
as
yesterday
return
what
perversity
justified
inflicting
pain
suffering
and
death
upon
others
who
have
done
no
wrong
if
death
ends
all
why
fight
while
we
are
living
why
shorten
life
with
unnecessary
pain
and
suffering
how
futile
are
the
petty
problems
of
individuals
with
their
hates
and
jealousies
when
all
vanish
with
death
all
the
prayers
in
the
world
can
not
wipe
out
one
injustice
every
wrong
is
irreparable
the
dead
can
not
forgive
all
the
tears
and
sighs
are
of
no
avail
forgiveness
can
not
be
granted
when
lips
can
not
move
praise
can
not
be
heard
when
ears
can
not
hear
joy
can
not
be
experienced
when
the
heart
no
longer
beats
and
the
happiness
of
an
affectionate
embrace
can
no
longer
be
felt
when
arms
are
limp
and
the
eyes
are
forever
closed
you
are
to
make
up
your
mind
whether
it
is
to
be
god
or
man
whether
you
are
to
be
free
or
a
slave
whether
it
is
to
be
progress
or
stagnation
as
long
as
man
loves
a
phantom
in
the
sky
more
than
he
loves
his
fellow
man
there
will
never
be
peace
upon
this
earth
so
long
as
man
worships
a
tyrant
as
the
fatherhood
of
god
there
will
never
be
a
brotherhood
of
man
you
must
make
the
choice
you
must
come
to
the
decision
is
it
to
be
god
or
man
churches
or
homes
preparation
for
death
or
happiness
for
the
living
if
ever
man
needed
an
example
of
the
benefit
of
the
one
against
the
other
he
need
but
read
the
pages
of
history
for
proof
of
how
religion
retarded
progress
and
provoked
hatred
among
the
children
of
men
when
theology
ruled
the
world
man
was
a
slave
the
people
lived
in
huts
and
hovels
they
were
clad
in
rags
and
skins
they
devoured
crusts
and
gnawed
bones
the
priests
wore
garments
of
silk
and
satin
carried
mitres
of
gold
and
precious
stones
robbed
the
poor
and
lived
upon
the
fat
of
the
land
here
and
there
a
brave
man
appeared
to
question
their
authority
these
martyrs
to
intellectual
emancipation
slowly
and
painfully
broke
the
spell
of
superstition
and
ushered
in
the
age
of
reason
and
the
dawn
of
science
man
became
the
only
god
that
man
can
know
he
no
longer
fell
upon
his
knees
in
fear
he
began
to
enjoy
the
fruits
of
his
own
labor
he
discovered
a
way
to
relieve
himself
from
the
drudgery
of
continuous
toil
he
began
to
enjoy
a
few
comforts
of
life
and
for
the
first
time
upon
this
earth
he
found
a
few
moments
for
happiness
it
is
far
more
important
to
learn
how
to
live
than
to
learn
how
to
pray
a
new
day
and
a
new
era
dawned
for
him
his
labors
produced
enormous
dividends
he
looked
at
the
sky
for
the
first
time
and
saw
that
it
was
blue
he
searched
the
heavens
and
found
no
god
he
no
longer
feared
the
manifestations
of
nature
the
stars
however
are
not
the
alphabet
upon
which
to
read
the
destiny
of
man
we
not
only
do
not
believe
that
man
is
punished
for
his
sins
but
emphatically
state
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
sin
there
are
wrongs
and
injustices
but
no
sin
sin
like
purgatory
and
hell
was
invented
by
priests
first
to
frighten
and
then
to
rob
the
living
we
do
not
fear
these
myths
and
curses
and
that
is
why
we
devote
our
time
and
energies
to
help
our
fellow
man
that
is
why
we
build
educational
institutions
and
seek
by
a
slow
and
painful
process
to
teach
man
the
true
nature
of
the
universe
and
a
proper
understanding
of
his
place
as
a
member
in
society
at
the
same
time
we
try
to
fortify
his
mind
with
courage
to
withstand
the
rebuffs
the
trials
and
tribulations
of
life
that
it
is
a
difficult
and
arduous
task
no
one
can
deny
because
we
can
not
correct
all
of
god
mistakes
in
one
life
time
as
ingersoll
so
succinctly
states
nature
can
not
pardon
remember
this
you
are
not
a
depraved
human
being
you
have
no
sins
to
atone
for
there
is
no
need
for
fear
there
are
no
ghosts
holy
or
otherwise
stop
making
yourself
miserable
for
the
love
of
god
drive
this
monster
of
tyrannic
fear
from
your
mind
and
enjoy
the
inestimable
freedom
of
an
emancipated
human
being
the
only
duty
you
owe
is
to
yourself
and
to
your
family
the
duty
you
owe
to
yourself
is
to
do
the
best
you
can
and
the
duty
you
owe
to
your
family
is
to
endeavor
to
make
them
happy
emancipate
yourself
from
these
stultifying
creeds
and
protect
your
children
from
the
contamination
of
religion
get
off
your
knees
stand
erect
and
look
the
whole
world
in
the
face
get
all
the
joy
and
happiness
you
can
out
of
life
enjoy
the
fruits
of
your
labor
and
waste
it
not
upon
the
myth
of
heaven
support
not
the
parasites
of
god
do
not
knowingly
harm
another
human
being
do
not
knowingly
injure
your
fellow
man
all
forms
of
life
have
feeling
do
not
make
them
suffer
as
shakespeare
says
the
poor
beetle
that
we
tread
upon
in
corporal
sufferance
finds
a
pang
as
great
as
when
a
giant
dies
kindness
is
a
magic
solvent
while
we
know
that
sometimes
ingratitude
is
more
strong
than
arms
we
also
know
that
mercy
is
twice
blest
it
blesses
him
that
gives
and
him
that
takes
and
it
should
be
remembered
that
while
loyalty
is
the
most
important
of
the
virtues
patience
is
the
most
valuable
become
a
courageous
human
being
and
do
the
best
you
can
under
any
and
all
circumstances
in
this
imperfect
and
troublesome
world
be
brave
enough
to
live
and
be
brave
enough
to
die
knowing
that
when
the
grim
reaper
comes
you
did
the
best
you
could
and
that
the
world
is
better
for
your
having
lived
a
god
could
do
no
more
i
will
stand
between
you
and
the
hosts
of
heaven
i
am
not
afraid
i
will
act
as
your
attorney
before
the
bar
of
judgment
i
will
assume
all
responsibility
my
services
are
free
put
the
blame
on
me
break
the
chains
of
mental
slavery
to
religious
superstition
arise
and
become
a
free
and
independent
human
being
dignify
