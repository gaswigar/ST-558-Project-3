was
afraid
not
of
the
present
or
the
future
but
of
the
past
he
was
afraid
of
the
thing
tagged
reed
kieran
that
stiff
blind
voiceless
thing
wheeling
its
slow
orbit
around
the
moon
companion
to
dead
worlds
and
silent
illustration
something
tiny
went
wrong
but
no
one
ever
knew
whether
it
was
in
an
electric
relay
or
in
the
brain
of
the
pilot
the
pilot
was
lieutenant
charles
wandek
unrc
home
address
anstey
avenue
detroit
he
did
not
survive
the
crash
of
his
ferry
into
wheel
five
neither
did
his
three
passengers
a
young
french
astrophysicist
an
east
indian
expert
on
magnetic
fields
and
a
man
from
philadelphia
who
was
coming
out
to
replace
a
pump
technician
someone
else
who
did
not
survive
was
reed
kieran
the
only
man
in
wheel
five
itself
to
lose
his
life
kieran
who
was
years
old
was
an
accredited
of
unrc
home
address
elm
street
midland
springs
ohio
kieran
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
a
confirmed
bachelor
was
in
wheel
five
because
of
a
woman
but
the
woman
who
had
sent
him
there
was
no
beautiful
lost
love
her
name
was
gertrude
lemmiken
she
was
nineteen
years
old
and
overweight
with
a
fat
stupid
face
she
suffered
from
and
sniffed
constantly
in
the
ohio
college
classroom
where
kieran
taught
physics
two
one
march
morning
kieran
could
bear
it
no
longer
he
told
himself
if
she
sniffs
this
morning
i
through
i
resign
and
join
the
unrc
gertrude
sniffed
six
months
later
having
finished
his
training
for
the
united
nations
reconnaissance
corps
kieran
shipped
out
for
a
term
of
duty
in
unrc
space
laboratory
number
known
more
familiarly
as
wheel
five
wheel
five
circled
the
moon
there
was
an
elaborate
base
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
in
this
year
there
were
laboratories
and
observatories
there
too
but
it
had
been
found
that
the
alternating
fortnights
of
boiling
heat
and
cold
on
the
lunar
surface
could
play
havoc
with
the
delicate
instruments
used
in
certain
researches
hence
wheel
five
had
been
built
and
was
staffed
by
research
men
who
were
rotated
at
regular
intervals
kieran
loved
it
from
the
first
he
thought
that
that
was
because
of
the
sheer
beauty
of
it
the
gaunt
silver
of
the
moon
forever
turning
beneath
the
still
and
solemn
glory
of
the
undimmed
stars
the
filamentaries
stretched
across
the
distant
like
shining
veils
the
quietness
the
peace
but
kieran
had
a
certain
intellectual
honesty
and
after
a
while
he
admitted
to
himself
that
neither
the
beauty
nor
the
romance
of
it
was
what
made
this
life
so
attractive
to
him
it
was
the
fact
that
he
was
far
away
from
earth
he
did
not
even
have
to
look
at
earth
for
nearly
all
geophysical
research
was
taken
care
of
by
wheels
two
and
three
that
circled
the
mother
planet
he
was
almost
completely
divorced
from
all
earth
problems
and
people
kieran
liked
people
but
had
never
felt
that
he
understood
them
what
seemed
important
to
them
all
the
drives
of
ordinary
existence
had
never
seemed
very
important
to
him
he
had
felt
that
there
must
be
something
wrong
with
him
something
lacking
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
people
everywhere
committed
the
most
outlandish
follies
believed
in
the
most
incredible
things
were
swayed
by
pure
into
the
most
harmful
courses
of
behavior
they
could
not
all
be
wrong
he
thought
so
he
must
be
wrong
and
it
had
worried
him
he
had
taken
partial
refuge
in
pure
science
but
the
study
and
then
the
teaching
of
astrophysics
had
not
been
the
refuge
that
wheel
five
was
he
would
be
sorry
to
leave
the
wheel
when
his
time
was
up
and
he
was
sorry
when
the
day
came
the
others
of
the
staff
were
already
out
in
the
docking
lock
in
the
rim
waiting
to
greet
the
replacements
from
the
ferry
kieran
hating
to
leave
lagged
behind
then
realizing
it
would
be
churlish
not
to
meet
this
young
frenchman
who
was
replacing
him
he
hurried
along
the
corridor
in
the
big
spoke
when
he
saw
the
ferry
coming
in
he
was
of
the
way
along
the
spoke
to
the
rim
when
it
happened
there
was
a
tremendous
crash
that
flung
him
violently
from
his
feet
he
felt
a
coldness
instant
and
terrible
he
was
dying
he
was
dead
the
ferry
had
been
coming
in
on
a
perfectly
normal
approach
when
the
tiny
something
went
wrong
in
the
ship
or
in
the
judgment
of
the
pilot
its
suddenly
blasted
on
full
it
heeled
over
sharply
it
smashed
through
the
big
starboard
spoke
like
a
knife
through
butter
wheel
five
staggered
rocked
and
floundered
the
automatic
safety
bulkheads
had
all
closed
and
the
big
spoke
section
was
the
only
section
to
blow
its
air
and
kieran
was
the
only
man
caught
in
it
the
alarms
went
off
and
while
the
wreckage
of
the
ferry
with
three
dead
men
in
it
was
still
drifting
close
by
everyone
in
the
wheel
was
in
his
and
emergency
measures
were
in
full
force
within
thirty
minutes
it
became
evident
that
the
wheel
was
going
to
survive
this
accident
it
was
edging
slowly
out
of
orbit
from
the
impetus
of
the
blow
and
in
the
present
weakened
state
of
the
construction
its
small
corrective
rockets
could
not
be
used
to
stop
the
drift
but
meloni
the
unrc
captain
commanding
had
got
first
reports
from
his
teams
and
it
did
not
look
too
bad
he
fired
off
peremptory
demands
for
the
repair
materials
he
would
need
and
was
assured
by
unrc
headquarters
at
mexico
city
that
the
ferries
would
be
loaded
and
on
their
way
as
soon
as
possible
meloni
was
just
beginning
to
relax
a
little
when
a
young
officer
brought
up
a
minor
but
vexing
problem
lieutenant
vinson
had
headed
the
small
party
sent
out
to
recover
the
bodies
of
the
four
dead
men
in
their
they
had
been
pawing
through
the
tangled
wreckage
for
some
time
and
young
vinson
was
tired
when
he
made
his
report
we
have
all
four
alongside
sir
the
three
men
in
the
ferry
were
pretty
badly
mangled
in
the
crash
kieran
was
physically
wounded
but
died
from
the
captain
stared
at
him
alongside
why
did
you
bring
them
in
they
go
back
in
one
of
the
ferries
to
earth
for
burial
but
vinson
started
to
protest
meloni
interrupted
sharply
you
need
to
learn
a
few
things
about
morale
lieutenant
you
think
it
going
to
do
morale
here
any
good
to
have
four
dead
men
floating
alongside
where
everyone
can
see
them
fetch
them
in
and
store
them
in
one
of
the
holds
vinson
sweating
and
unhappy
now
had
visions
of
a
black
mark
on
his
record
and
determined
to
make
his
point
but
about
kieran
sir
he
was
only
frozen
suppose
there
was
a
chance
to
bring
him
back
bring
him
back
what
the
devil
are
you
talking
about
vinson
said
i
read
they
trying
to
find
some
way
of
restoring
a
man
that
gets
some
scientists
down
at
delhi
university
if
they
succeeded
and
if
we
had
kieran
still
intact
in
space
oh
hell
that
just
a
scientific
they
never
find
a
way
to
do
that
meloni
said
it
all
just
theory
yes
sir
said
vinson
hanging
his
head
we
got
trouble
enough
here
without
you
bringing
up
ideas
like
this
the
captain
continued
angrily
get
out
of
here
vinson
was
now
completely
crushed
yes
sir
i
bring
the
bodies
in
he
went
out
meloni
stared
at
the
door
and
began
to
think
a
commanding
officer
had
to
be
careful
or
he
could
get
skinned
alive
if
by
some
remote
chance
this
delhi
idea
ever
succeeded
he
meloni
would
be
in
for
it
for
having
kieran
buried
he
strode
to
the
door
and
flung
it
open
mentally
cursing
the
young
snotty
who
had
had
to
bring
this
up
vinson
he
shouted
the
lieutenant
turned
back
startled
yes
sir
hold
kieran
body
outside
i
check
on
this
with
mexico
city
yes
sir
still
angry
meloni
shot
a
message
to
personnel
at
mexico
city
that
done
he
forgot
about
it
the
buck
had
been
passed
let
the
boys
sitting
on
their
backsides
down
on
earth
handle
it
colonel
hausman
second
in
command
of
personnel
division
of
unrc
was
the
man
to
whom
meloni
message
went
he
snorted
loudly
when
he
read
it
and
later
when
he
went
in
to
report
to
garces
the
brigadier
commanding
the
division
he
took
the
message
with
him
meloni
must
be
pretty
badly
rattled
by
the
crash
he
said
look
at
this
garces
read
the
message
then
looked
up
anything
to
this
the
delhi
experiments
i
mean
hausman
had
taken
care
to
brief
himself
on
that
point
and
was
able
to
answer
emphatically
damned
little
those
chaps
in
delhi
have
been
playing
around
freezing
insects
and
thawing
them
out
and
they
think
the
process
might
be
developed
someday
to
where
it
could
revive
frozen
spacemen
it
an
iffy
idea
i
burn
meloni
backside
off
for
bringing
it
up
at
a
time
like
this
garces
after
a
moment
shook
his
head
no
wait
let
me
think
about
this
he
looked
speculatively
out
of
the
window
for
a
few
moments
then
he
said
message
meloni
that
this
one
chap
body
what
his
name
kieran
is
to
be
preserved
in
space
against
a
chance
of
future
revival
hausman
nearly
blotted
his
copybook
by
exclaiming
for
god
sake
he
choked
that
down
in
time
and
said
but
it
could
be
centuries
before
a
revival
process
is
perfected
if
it
ever
is
garces
nodded
i
know
but
you
missing
a
psychological
point
that
could
be
valuable
to
unrc
this
kieran
has
relatives
does
he
hausman
nodded
a
widowed
mother
and
a
sister
his
father
been
dead
a
long
time
no
wife
or
children
garces
said
if
we
tell
them
he
dead
frozen
in
space
and
then
buried
it
all
over
with
wo
those
people
feel
a
lot
better
if
we
tell
them
that
he
dead
but
might
be
brought
back
when
a
is
perfected
in
the
future
i
suppose
they
feel
better
about
it
hausman
conceded
but
i
see
garces
shrugged
simple
we
only
really
beginning
in
space
you
know
as
we
go
on
unrc
is
going
to
lose
a
number
of
men
just
like
kieran
a
howl
will
go
up
about
our
casualty
lists
it
always
does
but
if
we
can
say
that
they
only
frozen
until
such
time
as
revival
technique
is
achieved
everyone
will
feel
better
about
it
i
suppose
public
relations
are
important
hausman
began
to
say
and
garces
nodded
quickly
they
are
see
that
this
is
done
when
you
go
up
to
confer
with
meloni
make
sure
that
it
gets
onto
the
video
networks
i
want
everyone
to
see
it
later
with
many
cameras
and
millions
of
people
watching
kieran
body
in
a
was
ceremoniously
taken
to
a
selected
position
where
it
would
orbit
the
moon
all
suggestions
of
the
funerary
were
carefully
avoided
the
man
nobody
at
all
referred
to
him
as
dead
would
remain
in
this
position
until
a
revival
process
was
perfected
until
forever
thought
hausman
watching
sourly
i
suppose
garces
is
right
but
they
have
a
whole
graveyard
here
as
time
goes
on
as
time
went
on
they
did
in
his
dreams
a
soft
voice
whispered
he
did
not
know
what
it
was
telling
him
except
that
it
was
important
he
was
hardly
aware
of
its
coming
the
times
it
came
there
would
be
the
quiet
murmuring
and
something
in
him
seemed
to
hear
and
understand
and
then
the
murmur
faded
away
and
there
was
nothing
but
the
dreams
again
but
were
they
dreams
nothing
had
form
or
meaning
light
darkness
sound
pain
and
flowed
over
him
flowed
over
who
who
was
he
he
did
not
even
know
that
he
did
not
care
but
he
came
to
care
the
question
vaguely
nagged
him
he
should
try
to
remember
there
was
more
than
dreams
and
the
whispering
voice
there
was
what
if
he
had
one
real
thing
to
cling
to
to
put
his
feet
on
and
climb
back
from
one
thing
like
his
name
he
had
no
name
he
was
no
one
sleep
and
forget
it
sleep
and
dream
and
listen
kieran
it
went
across
his
brain
like
a
shattering
bolt
of
lightning
that
word
he
did
not
know
what
the
word
was
or
what
it
meant
but
it
found
an
echo
somewhere
and
his
brain
screamed
it
kieran
not
his
brain
alone
his
voice
was
gasping
it
harshly
and
croakingly
his
lungs
seeming
on
fire
as
they
expelled
the
word
he
was
shaking
he
had
a
body
that
could
shake
that
could
feel
pain
that
was
feeling
pain
now
he
tried
to
move
to
break
the
nightmare
to
get
back
again
to
the
vague
dreams
and
the
soothing
whisper
he
moved
his
limbs
thrashed
leadenly
his
chest
heaved
and
panted
his
eyes
opened
he
lay
in
a
narrow
bunk
in
a
very
small
metal
room
he
looked
slowly
around
he
did
not
know
this
place
the
gleaming
white
metal
of
walls
and
ceiling
was
unfamiliar
there
was
a
slight
persistent
tingling
vibration
in
everything
that
was
unfamiliar
too
he
was
not
in
wheel
five
he
had
seen
every
cell
in
it
and
none
of
them
were
like
this
also
there
lacked
the
persistent
susurrant
sound
of
the
ventilation
pumps
where
in
a
ship
kieran
a
something
back
in
his
mind
told
him
that
but
of
course
it
was
ridiculous
a
quirk
of
the
imagination
there
were
any
starships
all
right
kieran
you
in
a
starship
and
you
all
the
emphatic
assurance
came
from
somewhere
back
in
his
brain
and
it
was
comforting
he
did
feel
very
good
he
felt
dopey
and
sore
but
there
was
no
use
worrying
about
it
when
he
knew
for
sure
he
was
all
right
the
hell
he
was
all
right
he
was
in
someplace
new
someplace
strange
and
he
felt
half
sick
and
he
was
not
all
right
at
all
instead
of
lying
here
on
his
back
listening
to
comforting
lies
from
his
imagination
he
should
get
up
find
out
what
was
going
on
what
had
happened
of
a
sudden
memory
began
to
clear
what
happened
something
a
crash
a
terrible
coldness
kieran
began
to
shiver
he
had
been
in
section
on
his
way
to
the
lock
and
suddenly
the
floor
had
risen
under
him
and
wheel
five
had
seemed
to
crash
into
pieces
around
him
the
cold
the
pain
in
a
starship
you
all
for
god
sake
why
did
his
mind
keep
telling
him
things
like
that
things
he
believed
for
if
he
did
not
believe
them
he
would
be
in
a
panic
not
knowing
where
he
was
how
he
had
come
here
there
was
panic
in
his
mind
but
there
was
a
barrier
against
it
the
barrier
of
the
soothing
reassurances
that
came
from
he
knew
not
where
he
tried
to
sit
up
it
was
useless
he
was
too
weak
he
lay
breathing
heavily
he
felt
that
he
should
be
hysterical
with
fear
but
somehow
he
was
not
that
barrier
in
his
mind
prevented
it
he
had
decided
to
try
shouting
when
a
door
in
the
side
of
the
little
room
slid
open
and
a
man
came
in
he
came
over
and
looked
down
at
kieran
he
was
a
young
man
with
a
compact
chunky
figure
and
a
flat
hard
face
his
eyes
were
blue
and
intense
and
they
gave
kieran
the
feeling
that
this
man
was
a
spring
he
looked
down
and
said
how
do
you
feel
kieran
kieran
looked
up
at
him
he
asked
am
i
in
a
starship
yes
but
there
are
any
starships
there
are
you
in
one
the
man
added
my
name
is
vaillant
true
what
he
murmured
the
something
in
kieran
mind
where
how
kieran
began
vaillant
interrupted
his
stammering
question
as
to
where
we
quite
a
way
from
earth
heading
right
now
in
the
general
direction
of
altair
as
to
how
he
paused
looking
keenly
down
at
kieran
do
you
know
how
course
i
know
i
was
frozen
and
now
i
have
been
awakened
and
time
has
gone
by
vaillant
looking
searchingly
down
at
his
face
showed
a
trace
of
relief
you
do
know
do
you
for
a
moment
i
was
afraid
it
worked
he
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bunk
how
long
asked
kieran
vaillant
answered
as
casually
as
though
it
was
the
most
ordinary
question
in
the
world
a
bit
over
a
century
it
was
wonderful
thought
kieran
how
he
could
take
a
statement
like
that
without
getting
excited
it
was
almost
as
though
he
known
it
all
the
time
how
he
began
when
there
was
an
interruption
something
buzzed
thinly
in
the
pocket
of
vaillant
shirt
he
took
out
a
thin
disk
of
metal
and
said
sharply
into
it
yes
a
tiny
voice
squawked
from
the
disk
it
was
too
far
from
kieran
for
him
to
understand
what
it
was
saying
but
it
had
a
note
of
excitement
almost
of
panic
in
it
something
changed
hardened
in
vaillant
flat
face
he
said
i
expected
it
i
be
right
there
you
know
what
to
do
he
did
something
to
the
disk
and
spoke
into
it
again
paula
take
over
here
he
stood
up
kieran
looked
up
at
him
feeling
numb
and
stupid
i
like
to
know
some
things
later
said
vaillant
we
got
troubles
stay
where
you
are
he
went
rapidly
out
of
the
room
kieran
looked
after
him
wondering
troubles
troubles
in
a
starship
and
a
century
had
passed
he
suddenly
felt
an
emotion
that
shook
his
nerves
and
tightened
his
guts
it
was
beginning
to
hit
him
now
he
sat
up
in
the
bunk
and
swung
his
legs
out
of
it
and
tried
to
stand
but
could
not
he
was
too
weak
all
he
could
do
was
to
sit
there
shaking
his
mind
could
not
take
it
in
it
seemed
only
minutes
ago
that
he
had
been
walking
along
the
corridor
in
wheel
five
it
seemed
that
wheel
five
must
exist
that
the
earth
the
people
the
time
he
knew
must
still
be
somewhere
out
there
this
could
be
some
kind
of
a
joke
or
some
kind
of
psychological
experiment
that
was
it
the
boys
were
always
making
experiments
to
find
out
how
men
would
bear
up
in
unusual
conditions
and
this
must
be
one
of
them
a
woman
came
into
the
room
she
was
a
dark
woman
who
might
have
been
thirty
years
old
and
who
wore
a
white
shirt
and
slacks
she
would
he
thought
have
been
if
she
had
not
looked
so
tired
and
so
edgy
she
came
over
and
looked
down
at
him
and
said
to
him
do
try
to
get
up
yet
you
feel
better
very
soon
her
voice
was
a
slightly
husky
one
it
was
utterly
familiar
to
kieran
and
yet
he
had
never
seen
this
woman
before
then
it
came
to
him
you
were
the
one
who
talked
to
me
he
said
looking
up
at
her
in
the
dreams
i
mean
she
nodded
i
paula
ray
and
i
a
psychologist
you
had
to
be
psychologically
prepared
for
your
awakening
prepared
the
woman
explained
patiently
hypnopedic
technique
establishing
facts
in
the
subconscious
of
a
sleeping
patient
otherwise
it
would
be
too
terrific
a
shock
for
you
when
you
awakened
that
was
proved
when
they
first
tried
reviving
men
forty
or
fifty
years
ago
the
comfortable
conviction
that
this
was
all
a
fake
an
experiment
of
some
kind
began
to
drain
out
of
kieran
but
if
it
was
true
he
asked
with
some
difficulty
you
say
that
they
found
out
how
to
revive
men
that
long
ago
yes
yet
it
took
forty
or
fifty
years
to
get
around
to
reviving
me
the
woman
sighed
you
have
a
misconception
the
process
of
revival
was
perfected
that
long
ago
but
it
has
been
used
only
immediately
after
a
wreck
or
disaster
men
or
women
in
the
old
have
not
been
revived
why
not
he
asked
carefully
unsatisfactory
results
she
said
they
could
not
adjust
psychologically
to
changed
conditions
they
usually
became
unbalanced
some
suicides
and
a
number
of
cases
of
extreme
schizophrenia
resulted
it
was
decided
that
it
was
no
kindness
to
the
older
cases
to
bring
them
back
but
you
brought
me
back
yes
why
there
were
good
reasons
she
was
clearly
evading
that
question
she
went
on
quickly
the
psychological
shock
of
awakening
would
have
been
devastating
if
you
were
not
prepared
so
while
you
were
still
under
sedation
i
used
the
hypnopedic
method
on
you
your
unconscious
was
aware
of
the
main
facts
of
the
situation
before
you
awoke
and
that
cushioned
the
shock
kieran
thought
of
himself
lying
frozen
and
dead
in
a
graveyard
that
was
space
bodies
drifting
in
orbit
circling
slowly
around
each
other
as
the
years
passed
in
a
macabre
sarabande
a
deep
shiver
shook
him
because
all
victims
were
in
dehydration
was
not
the
problem
it
could
have
been
paula
was
saying
but
still
a
highly
delicate
process
he
looked
at
her
and
interrupted
roughly
what
reasons
and
when
she
stared
blankly
he
added
you
said
there
were
good
reasons
why
you
picked
me
for
revival
what
reasons
her
face
became
tight
and
alert
you
were
the
oldest
victim
in
point
of
date
that
was
one
of
the
determining
factors
look
said
kieran
i
not
a
child
nor
yet
a
savage
you
can
drop
the
patronizing
professional
jargon
and
answer
my
question
her
voice
became
hard
and
brittle
you
new
to
this
environment
you
would
understand
if
i
told
you
try
me
all
right
she
answered
we
need
you
as
a
symbol
in
a
political
struggle
we
waging
against
the
sakae
the
sakae
i
told
you
that
you
could
understand
yet
she
answered
impatiently
turning
away
you
ca
expect
me
to
fill
you
in
on
a
whole
world
that
new
to
you
in
five
minutes
she
started
toward
the
door
oh
no
said
kieran
you
not
going
yet
he
slid
out
of
the
bunk
he
felt
weak
and
shaky
but
resentment
energized
his
flaccid
muscles
he
took
a
step
toward
her
the
lights
suddenly
went
dim
and
a
roar
sounded
from
somewhere
an
appalling
sound
of
raw
power
the
slight
tingling
that
kieran
had
felt
in
the
metal
fabric
around
him
abruptly
became
a
vibration
so
deep
and
powerful
that
it
dizzied
him
and
he
had
to
grab
the
stanchion
of
the
bunk
to
keep
from
falling
alarm
had
flashed
into
the
woman
face
next
moment
from
some
hidden
speaker
in
the
wall
a
male
voice
yelled
sharply
overtaken
prepare
for
extreme
evasion
get
back
into
the
bunk
she
told
kieran
what
is
it
it
may
be
she
said
with
a
certain
faint
viciousness
that
about
to
die
a
second
time
the
lights
dimmed
to
and
the
deep
vibration
grew
worse
kieran
clutched
the
woman
arm
what
happening
damn
it
let
me
go
she
said
the
exclamation
was
so
wholly
familiar
in
its
human
angriness
that
kieran
almost
liked
her
for
the
first
time
but
he
continued
to
hold
onto
her
although
he
did
not
feel
that
with
his
present
weakness
he
could
hold
her
long
i
a
right
to
know
he
said
all
right
perhaps
you
have
said
paula
we
our
group
are
operating
against
authority
we
broken
laws
in
going
to
earth
and
reviving
you
and
now
authority
is
catching
up
to
us
another
ship
is
there
going
to
be
a
fight
a
fight
she
stared
at
him
and
shock
and
then
faint
repulsion
showed
in
her
face
but
of
course
you
come
from
the
old
time
of
wars
you
would
think
that
kieran
got
the
impression
that
what
he
had
said
had
made
her
look
at
him
with
the
same
feelings
he
would
have
had
when
he
looked
at
a
decent
worthy
savage
who
happened
to
be
a
cannibal
i
always
felt
that
bringing
you
back
was
a
mistake
she
said
with
a
sharpness
in
her
voice
let
me
go
she
wrenched
away
from
him
and
before
he
could
stop
her
she
had
got
to
the
door
and
slid
it
open
he
woke
up
in
time
to
lurch
after
her
and
he
got
his
shoulder
into
the
before
she
could
slide
it
shut
oh
very
well
since
you
insist
i
not
going
to
worry
about
you
she
said
rapidly
and
turned
and
hurried
away
kieran
wanted
to
follow
her
but
his
knees
were
buckling
under
him
he
hung
to
the
side
of
the
he
felt
angry
and
anger
was
all
that
kept
him
from
falling
over
he
would
not
faint
he
told
himself
he
was
not
a
child
and
would
not
be
treated
like
one
he
got
his
head
outside
the
door
there
was
a
long
and
very
narrow
corridor
out
there
blank
metal
with
a
few
closed
doors
along
it
one
door
away
down
toward
the
end
of
the
corridor
was
just
sliding
shut
he
started
down
the
corridor
steadying
himself
with
his
hand
against
the
smooth
wall
before
he
had
gone
more
than
a
few
steps
the
anger
that
pushed
him
began
to
ebb
away
of
a
sudden
the
mountainous
and
incredible
fact
of
his
being
here
in
this
place
this
time
this
ship
came
down
on
him
like
an
avalanche
from
which
the
hypnopedic
would
no
longer
protect
him
am
touching
a
starship
i
am
in
a
starship
i
reed
kieran
of
midland
springs
ohio
i
ought
to
be
back
there
teaching
my
classes
stopping
at
hartnett
drug
store
for
a
soft
drink
on
the
way
home
but
i
am
here
in
a
ship
fleeing
through
the
stars
his
head
was
spinning
and
he
was
afraid
that
he
was
going
to
go
out
again
he
found
himself
at
the
door
and
slid
it
open
and
fell
rather
than
walked
inside
he
heard
a
startled
voice
this
was
a
bigger
room
there
was
a
table
whose
top
was
translucent
and
which
showed
a
bewildering
mass
of
fleeting
symbols
in
bright
light
ever
changing
there
was
a
screen
on
one
wall
of
the
room
and
that
showed
nothing
a
blank
dark
surface
vaillant
and
paula
ray
and
a
tall
man
of
middle
age
were
around
the
table
and
had
looked
up
surprised
vaillant
face
flashed
irritation
paula
you
were
supposed
to
keep
him
in
his
cabin
i
did
think
he
was
strong
enough
to
follow
she
said
i
not
said
kieran
and
pitched
over
the
tall
man
reached
and
caught
him
before
he
hit
the
floor
and
eased
him
into
a
chair
he
heard
as
though
from
a
great
distance
vaillant
voice
saying
irritatedly
let
paula
take
care
of
him
webber
look
at
this
going
to
cross
another
rift
there
were
a
few
minutes
then
when
everything
was
very
jumbled
up
in
kieran
mind
the
woman
was
talking
to
him
she
was
telling
him
that
they
had
prepared
him
physically
as
well
as
psychologically
for
the
shock
of
revival
and
that
he
would
be
quite
all
right
but
had
to
take
things
more
slowly
he
heard
her
voice
but
paid
little
attention
he
sat
in
the
chair
and
blankly
watched
the
two
men
who
hung
over
the
table
and
its
flow
of
brilliant
symbols
vaillant
seemed
to
tighten
up
more
and
more
as
the
moments
passed
and
there
was
still
about
him
the
look
of
a
coiled
spring
but
now
the
spring
seemed
to
be
wound
to
the
webber
the
tall
man
with
the
tough
face
watched
the
fleeting
symbols
and
his
face
was
stony
here
we
go
he
muttered
and
both
he
and
vaillant
looked
up
at
the
blank
black
screen
on
the
wall
kieran
looked
too
there
was
nothing
then
in
an
instant
the
blackness
vanished
from
the
screen
and
it
framed
a
vista
of
such
cosmic
stunning
splendor
that
kieran
could
not
grasp
it
stars
blazed
like
high
fires
across
the
screen
loops
and
chains
and
shining
clots
of
them
this
was
not
too
different
from
the
way
they
had
looked
from
wheel
five
but
what
was
different
was
that
the
starry
firmament
was
partly
blotted
out
by
vast
rifted
ramparts
of
blackness
ebon
cliffs
that
went
up
to
infinity
kieran
had
seen
astronomical
photographs
like
this
and
knew
what
the
blackness
was
dust
a
dust
so
fine
that
its
percentage
of
particles
in
space
would
be
a
vacuum
on
earth
but
here
where
it
extended
over
parsecs
of
space
it
formed
a
barrier
to
light
there
was
a
narrow
rift
here
between
the
titan
cliffs
of
darkness
and
he
the
ship
he
was
in
was
fleeing
across
that
rift
the
screen
abruptly
went
black
again
kieran
remained
sitting
and
staring
at
it
that
incredible
fleeting
vision
had
finally
impressed
the
utter
reality
of
all
this
upon
his
mind
they
this
ship
were
far
from
earth
very
far
in
one
of
the
in
which
they
were
trying
to
lose
pursuers
this
was
will
have
got
another
fix
on
us
as
we
crossed
for
sure
vaillant
was
saying
in
a
bitter
voice
they
have
the
net
out
for
us
the
pattern
will
be
shaping
now
and
we
ca
slip
through
it
we
ca
said
webber
the
ship
ca
but
the
flitter
can
with
luck
they
both
looked
at
kieran
he
the
important
one
webber
said
if
a
couple
of
us
could
get
him
through
no
said
paula
we
could
as
soon
as
they
caught
the
ship
and
found
the
flitter
gone
they
be
after
him
not
to
sako
said
webber
they
never
figure
that
we
take
him
to
sako
do
i
have
a
word
in
this
asked
kieran
between
his
teeth
what
asked
vaillant
this
the
hell
with
you
all
i
go
no
place
with
you
or
for
you
he
got
a
savage
satisfaction
from
saying
it
he
was
tired
of
sitting
there
like
a
booby
while
they
discussed
him
but
he
did
not
get
the
reaction
from
them
he
had
expected
the
two
men
merely
continued
to
look
thoughtfully
at
him
the
woman
sighed
you
see
there
was
time
enough
to
explain
it
to
him
it
natural
for
him
to
react
with
hostility
put
him
out
and
take
him
along
said
webber
no
said
paula
sharply
if
he
goes
out
right
now
he
liable
to
stay
out
i
wo
answer
for
it
meanwhile
said
vaillant
with
an
edge
to
his
voice
the
pattern
is
forming
up
have
you
any
suggestions
paula
she
nodded
this
she
suddenly
squeezed
something
under
kieran
nose
a
small
thing
that
she
had
produced
from
her
pocket
without
his
noticing
it
in
his
angry
preoccupation
with
the
two
men
he
smelled
a
sweet
refreshing
odor
and
he
struck
her
arm
away
oh
no
you
not
giving
me
any
more
dopes
then
he
stopped
for
suddenly
it
all
seemed
wryly
humorous
to
him
a
bunch
of
bloody
incompetents
he
said
and
laughed
this
is
the
one
thing
i
would
never
have
dreamed
that
a
man
could
sleep
and
wake
up
in
a
starship
and
find
the
starship
manned
by
blunderers
euphoric
said
paula
to
the
two
men
at
that
said
webber
sourly
there
may
be
something
in
what
he
says
about
us
vaillant
turned
on
him
and
said
fiercely
if
that
what
you
think
then
he
controlled
himself
and
said
tightly
quarrelling
no
good
we
in
a
box
but
we
can
maybe
still
put
it
over
if
we
get
this
man
to
sako
webber
you
and
paula
take
him
in
the
flitter
kieran
rose
to
his
feet
fine
he
said
gaily
let
us
go
in
the
flitter
whatever
that
is
i
am
already
bored
with
starships
he
felt
good
very
good
he
felt
a
little
drunk
not
enough
to
impede
his
mental
processes
but
enough
to
give
him
a
fine
indifference
to
what
happened
next
so
it
was
only
the
spray
paula
had
given
him
it
still
made
his
body
feel
better
and
removed
his
shock
and
worry
and
made
everything
seem
suddenly
rather
amusing
let
us
to
sako
in
the
flitter
he
said
after
all
i
living
on
velvet
i
might
as
well
see
the
whole
show
i
sure
that
sako
wherever
it
is
will
be
just
as
full
of
human
folly
as
earth
was
he
euphoric
paula
said
again
but
her
face
was
stricken
of
all
the
people
in
that
we
had
to
pick
one
who
thinks
like
that
said
vaillant
with
a
sort
of
restrained
fury
you
said
yourself
that
the
oldest
one
would
be
the
best
said
webber
sako
will
change
him
kieran
walked
down
the
corridor
with
webber
and
paula
and
he
laughed
as
he
walked
they
had
brought
him
back
from
nothingness
without
his
consent
violating
the
privacy
of
death
or
and
now
something
that
he
had
just
said
had
bitterly
disappointed
them
come
along
he
said
buoyantly
to
the
two
let
us
not
lag
once
aboard
the
flitter
and
the
girl
is
mine
oh
for
god
sake
shut
up
said
webber
it
was
ridiculous
to
be
flying
the
stars
with
a
bad
hangover
but
kieran
had
one
his
head
ached
dully
he
had
an
unpleasant
metallic
taste
in
his
mouth
and
his
former
ebullience
had
given
way
to
a
dull
depression
he
looked
sourly
around
he
sat
in
a
confined
little
metal
coop
of
a
cabin
hardly
enough
in
which
to
stand
erect
paula
ray
in
a
chair
a
few
feet
away
was
sleeping
her
head
on
her
breast
webber
sat
forward
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
with
a
number
of
crowded
control
banks
in
front
of
it
he
was
not
doing
anything
to
the
controls
he
looked
as
though
he
might
be
sleeping
too
that
was
all
a
tiny
metal
room
blank
metal
walls
silence
they
were
presumably
flying
between
the
stars
at
incredible
speeds
but
there
was
nothing
to
show
it
there
were
no
screens
such
as
the
one
he
had
seen
in
the
ship
to
show
by
artful
scanning
devices
what
vista
of
suns
and
darknesses
lay
outside
a
flitter
webber
had
informed
him
just
does
have
room
for
the
complicated
apparatus
that
such
scanners
require
seeing
is
a
luxury
you
dispense
with
in
a
flitter
we
see
when
we
get
to
sako
after
a
moment
he
had
added
if
we
get
to
sako
kieran
had
merely
laughed
then
and
had
promptly
gone
to
sleep
when
he
had
awakened
it
had
been
with
the
euphoria
all
gone
and
with
his
present
hangover
at
least
he
told
himself
i
can
truthfully
say
that
this
one
my
fault
that
blasted
spray
he
looked
resentfully
at
the
sleeping
woman
in
the
chair
then
he
reached
and
roughly
shook
her
shoulder
she
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
at
him
first
sleepily
and
then
with
resentment
you
had
no
right
to
wake
me
up
she
said
then
before
kieran
could
retort
she
seemed
to
realize
the
monumental
irony
of
what
she
had
just
said
and
she
burst
into
laughter
i
sorry
she
said
go
ahead
and
say
it
i
had
no
right
to
wake
up
let
come
back
to
that
said
kieran
after
a
moment
why
did
you
paula
looked
at
him
ruefully
what
i
need
now
is
a
history
of
the
last
century
and
time
enough
for
you
to
read
it
but
since
we
do
have
either
she
broke
off
then
after
a
pause
asked
your
date
was
was
it
it
and
your
name
were
on
the
tag
of
your
that
right
well
then
back
in
it
was
expected
that
men
would
spread
out
to
the
stars
was
it
kieran
nodded
as
soon
as
they
had
a
workable
drive
several
drives
were
being
experimented
with
even
then
one
of
them
the
flournoy
principle
was
finally
made
workable
she
said
she
frowned
i
trying
to
give
you
this
briefly
and
i
keep
straying
into
details
just
tell
me
why
you
woke
me
up
i
to
tell
you
she
asked
candidly
were
you
always
so
damned
hateful
or
did
the
revivification
process
do
this
to
you
kieran
grinned
all
right
go
ahead
things
happened
pretty
much
as
people
foresaw
back
in
she
said
the
drive
was
perfected
the
ships
went
out
to
the
nearer
stars
they
found
worlds
they
established
colonies
from
the
overflowing
population
of
earth
they
found
human
indigenous
races
on
a
few
worlds
all
of
them
at
a
rather
low
technical
level
and
they
taught
them
there
was
a
determination
from
the
beginning
to
make
it
one
universe
no
separate
nationalistic
groups
no
chance
of
wars
the
governing
council
was
set
up
at
altair
two
every
world
was
represented
there
are
of
them
now
it
expected
to
go
on
like
that
till
there
are
hundred
starworlds
represented
there
thousand
any
number
but
kieran
had
been
listening
closely
but
what
what
upset
this
particular
utopia
sako
this
world
we
going
to
yes
she
said
soberly
men
found
something
different
about
this
world
when
they
reached
it
it
had
people
human
people
on
it
very
low
in
the
scale
of
civilization
well
what
was
the
problem
could
you
start
teaching
them
as
you
had
others
she
shook
her
head
it
would
take
a
long
while
but
that
was
the
real
problem
it
was
you
see
there
another
race
on
sako
beside
the
human
ones
and
it
a
fairly
civilized
race
the
sakae
the
trouble
is
the
sakae
are
human
kieran
stared
at
her
so
what
if
they
intelligent
you
talk
as
though
it
was
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
she
flashed
is
it
if
your
sakae
are
intelligent
and
the
humans
of
sako
are
then
the
sakae
have
the
rights
on
that
world
do
they
she
looked
at
him
not
saying
anything
and
again
she
had
that
stricken
look
of
one
who
has
tried
and
failed
then
from
up
forward
without
turning
webber
spoke
what
do
you
think
now
of
vaillant
fine
idea
paula
it
can
still
work
she
said
but
there
was
no
conviction
in
her
voice
if
you
do
mind
said
kieran
with
an
edge
to
his
voice
i
still
like
to
know
what
this
sako
business
has
to
do
with
reviving
me
the
sakae
rule
the
humans
on
that
world
paula
answered
there
are
some
of
us
who
do
believe
they
should
in
the
council
we
known
as
the
humanity
party
because
we
believe
that
humans
should
not
be
ruled
by
again
kieran
was
distracted
from
his
immediate
question
this
time
by
the
phrase
these
sakae
what
are
they
like
they
not
monsters
if
that
what
you
thinking
of
paula
said
they
bipeds
lizardoid
rather
than
humanoid
and
are
a
fairly
intelligent
and
lot
if
they
all
that
and
higher
in
development
than
the
humans
why
should
they
rule
their
own
world
demanded
kieran
webber
uttered
a
sardonic
laugh
without
turning
he
asked
shall
i
change
course
and
go
to
altair
no
she
said
her
eyes
flashed
at
kieran
and
she
spoke
almost
breathlessly
you
very
sure
about
things
you
just
heard
about
are
you
you
know
what
right
and
you
know
what
wrong
even
though
you
only
been
in
this
time
this
universe
for
a
few
hours
kieran
looked
at
her
closely
he
thought
he
was
beginning
to
get
a
glimmer
of
the
shape
of
things
now
you
all
you
who
woke
me
up
illegally
you
belong
to
this
humanity
party
do
you
you
did
it
for
some
reason
connected
with
that
yes
she
answered
defiantly
we
need
a
symbol
in
this
political
struggle
we
thought
that
one
of
the
oldtime
space
pioneers
one
of
the
humans
who
began
the
conquest
of
the
stars
would
be
it
we
kieran
interrupted
i
think
i
get
it
it
was
really
considerate
of
you
you
drag
a
man
back
from
what
amounts
to
death
for
a
party
rally
space
hero
condemns
it
would
go
something
like
that
would
it
listen
she
began
listen
hell
he
said
he
was
hot
with
rage
shaking
with
it
i
am
glad
to
say
that
you
could
not
possibly
have
picked
a
worse
symbol
than
me
i
have
no
more
use
for
the
idea
of
the
innate
sacred
superiority
of
one
species
over
another
than
i
had
for
that
of
one
kind
of
man
over
another
her
face
changed
from
an
angry
woman
she
suddenly
became
a
professional
psychologist
coolly
observing
reactions
it
not
the
political
question
you
really
resent
she
said
wakened
to
a
strange
world
and
you
afraid
of
it
in
spite
of
all
the
preparation
we
gave
your
subconscious
you
afraid
and
so
you
angry
kieran
got
a
grip
on
himself
he
shrugged
what
you
say
may
be
true
but
it
does
change
the
way
i
feel
i
will
not
help
you
one
damned
bit
webber
got
up
from
his
seat
and
came
back
toward
them
his
tall
form
stooping
he
looked
at
kieran
and
then
at
the
woman
we
have
to
settle
this
right
now
he
said
we
getting
near
enough
to
sako
to
go
out
of
drive
are
we
going
to
land
or
are
we
yes
said
paula
steadily
we
landing
webber
glanced
again
at
kieran
face
but
if
that
the
way
he
feels
go
ahead
and
land
she
said
it
was
nothing
like
landing
in
a
rocket
first
there
was
the
business
referred
to
as
going
out
of
drive
paula
made
kieran
strap
in
and
she
said
you
may
find
this
unpleasant
but
just
sit
tight
it
does
last
long
kieran
sat
stiff
and
glowering
prepared
for
anything
and
determined
not
to
show
it
no
matter
how
he
felt
then
webber
did
something
to
the
control
board
and
the
universe
fell
apart
stomach
came
up
and
stuck
in
his
throat
he
was
falling
up
down
sideways
he
did
know
but
whichever
it
was
not
all
the
parts
of
him
were
falling
at
the
same
rate
or
perhaps
it
was
not
all
in
the
same
direction
he
did
know
that
either
but
it
was
an
exceptionally
hideous
feeling
he
opened
his
mouth
to
protest
and
all
of
a
sudden
he
was
sitting
normally
in
the
chair
in
the
normal
cabin
and
screaming
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
he
shut
up
paula
said
i
told
you
it
would
be
unpleasant
so
you
did
said
kieran
he
sat
sweating
his
hands
and
feet
were
cold
now
for
the
first
time
he
became
aware
of
motion
the
flitter
seemed
to
hurtle
forward
at
speed
kieran
knew
that
this
was
merely
an
ironic
little
joke
because
now
they
were
proceeding
at
something
in
the
range
of
normal
velocity
whereas
before
their
speed
had
been
quite
beyond
his
comprehension
but
he
could
comprehend
this
he
could
feel
it
they
were
going
like
a
bat
out
of
hell
and
somewhere
ahead
of
them
was
a
planet
and
he
was
closed
in
blind
a
mouse
in
a
his
insides
writhed
with
helplessness
and
the
imminence
of
a
crash
he
wanted
very
much
to
start
screaming
again
but
paula
was
watching
him
in
a
few
moments
that
desire
became
academic
a
whistling
shriek
began
faintly
outside
the
hull
and
built
swiftly
to
a
point
where
nothing
could
have
been
heard
above
it
atmosphere
and
somewhere
under
the
blind
wall
of
the
flitter
a
reeling
and
rushing
leaping
to
meet
them
the
flitter
slowed
it
seemed
to
hang
motionless
quivering
faintly
then
it
dropped
express
elevator
in
the
world
tallest
building
top
to
bottom
only
the
elevator
is
a
bubble
and
the
wind
is
tossing
it
from
side
to
side
as
it
drops
and
there
is
no
bottom
they
hung
again
bounding
lightly
on
the
unseen
wind
then
down
and
hang
again
and
down
paula
said
suddenly
webber
webber
i
think
he
dying
she
began
to
unstrap
kieran
said
faintly
am
i
turning
green
she
looked
at
him
frowning
yes
a
simple
old
malady
i
seasick
tell
webber
to
quit
playing
and
put
this
thing
down
paula
made
an
impatient
gesture
and
tightened
her
belt
again
hang
and
drop
once
more
twice
more
a
little
rocking
bounce
a
light
thump
motion
ceased
webber
turned
a
series
of
switches
silence
kieran
said
air
webber
opened
a
hatch
in
the
side
of
the
cabin
light
poured
in
it
had
to
be
sunlight
kieran
knew
but
it
was
a
queer
color
a
sort
of
tawny
orange
that
carried
a
pleasantly
burning
heat
he
got
loose
with
paula
helping
him
and
tottered
to
the
hatch
the
air
smelled
of
clean
dust
and
some
kind
of
vegetation
kieran
climbed
out
of
the
flitter
practically
throwing
himself
out
in
his
haste
he
wanted
solid
ground
under
him
he
did
care
whose
or
where
and
as
his
boots
thumped
onto
the
sand
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
had
been
a
very
long
time
since
he
had
had
solid
ground
underfoot
a
very
long
time
indeed
his
insides
knotted
up
again
and
this
time
it
was
not
seasickness
but
fear
and
he
was
cold
all
through
again
in
spite
of
the
hot
new
sun
he
was
afraid
not
of
the
present
nor
of
the
future
but
of
the
past
he
was
afraid
of
the
thing
tagged
reed
kieran
the
stiff
blind
voiceless
thing
wheeling
its
slow
orbit
around
the
moon
companion
to
dead
worlds
and
dead
space
brother
to
the
cold
and
the
dark
he
began
to
tremble
paula
shook
him
she
was
talking
but
he
could
hear
her
he
could
only
hear
the
rush
of
eternal
darkness
past
his
ears
the
thin
squeak
of
his
shadow
brushing
across
the
stars
webber
face
was
somewhere
above
him
looking
angry
and
disgusted
he
was
talking
to
paula
shaking
his
head
they
were
far
away
kieran
was
losing
them
drifting
away
from
them
on
the
black
tide
then
suddenly
there
was
something
like
an
explosion
a
crimson
flare
across
the
black
a
burst
of
heat
against
the
cold
shocked
and
wild
the
physical
part
of
him
clawed
back
to
reality
something
hurt
him
something
threatened
him
he
put
his
hand
to
his
cheek
and
it
came
away
red
paula
and
webber
were
yanking
at
him
trying
to
get
him
to
move
a
stone
whizzed
past
his
head
it
struck
the
side
of
the
flitter
with
a
sharp
clack
and
fell
kieran
nervous
relays
finally
connected
he
jumped
for
the
open
hatch
automatically
he
pushed
paula
ahead
of
him
trying
to
shield
her
and
she
gave
him
an
odd
startled
look
webber
was
already
inside
more
stones
rattled
around
and
one
grazed
thigh
it
hurt
his
cheek
was
bleeding
freely
he
rolled
inside
the
flitter
and
turned
to
look
back
out
the
hatch
he
was
mad
who
doing
it
he
demanded
paula
pointed
at
first
kieran
was
distracted
by
the
strangeness
of
the
landscape
the
flitter
crouched
in
a
vastness
of
sand
laced
with
some
plant
that
shone
like
metallic
gold
in
the
sunlight
the
sand
receded
in
tilted
planes
lifting
gradually
to
a
range
of
mountains
on
the
right
and
dropping
gradually
to
infinity
on
the
left
directly
in
front
of
the
flitter
and
quite
literally
a
throw
away
was
the
beginning
of
a
thick
belt
of
trees
that
grew
beside
a
river
apparently
quite
a
wide
one
though
he
could
not
see
much
but
a
tawny
sparkling
of
water
the
course
of
the
river
could
be
traced
clear
back
to
the
mountains
by
the
winding
line
of
woods
that
followed
its
bed
the
trees
themselves
were
not
like
any
kieran
had
seen
before
there
seemed
to
be
several
varieties
all
grotesque
in
shape
and
exotic
in
color
there
were
even
some
green
ones
with
long
sharp
leaves
that
looked
like
spearheads
exotic
or
not
they
made
perfectly
adequate
cover
stones
came
whistling
out
of
the
woods
but
kieran
could
not
see
anything
where
paula
was
pointing
but
an
occasional
shaking
of
foliage
sakae
he
asked
webber
snorted
you
know
it
when
the
sakae
find
us
they
do
throw
stones
these
are
the
humans
paula
said
there
was
an
indulgent
softness
in
her
voice
that
irritated
kieran
i
thought
they
were
our
dear
little
friends
he
said
you
frightened
them
frightened
them
they
seen
the
flitter
before
but
they
extremely
alert
to
modes
of
behavior
and
they
knew
you
were
acting
right
they
thought
you
were
sick
so
they
tried
to
kill
me
nice
fellows
webber
said
they
ca
afford
the
luxury
of
too
much
kindness
they
very
kind
among
themselves
paula
said
defensively
to
kieran
she
added
i
doubt
if
they
were
trying
to
kill
you
they
just
wanted
to
drive
you
away
oh
well
said
kieran
in
that
case
i
would
dream
of
disappointing
them
let
go
paula
glared
at
him
and
turned
to
webber
talk
to
them
i
hope
there
time
webber
grunted
glancing
at
the
sky
sitting
ducks
here
keep
your
patient
quiet
any
more
of
that
moaning
and
flopping
and
we
sunk
he
picked
up
a
large
plastic
container
and
moved
closer
to
the
door
paula
looked
at
kieran
cheek
let
me
fix
that
do
bother
he
said
at
this
moment
he
hoped
the
sakae
whoever
and
whatever
they
were
would
come
along
and
clap
these
two
into
some
suitable
place
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
webber
began
to
talk
kieran
stared
at
him
fascinated
he
had
expected
words
primitive
words
perhaps
resembling
the
of
earth
survivals
but
words
of
some
sort
webber
hooted
it
was
a
soft
reassuring
sound
repeated
over
and
over
but
it
was
not
a
word
the
rattle
of
stones
diminished
then
stopped
webber
continued
to
make
his
hooting
call
presently
it
was
answered
webber
turned
and
nodded
at
paula
smiling
he
reached
into
the
plastic
container
and
drew
forth
a
handful
of
brownish
objects
that
smelled
to
kieran
like
dried
fruit
webber
tossed
these
out
onto
the
sand
now
he
made
a
different
sound
a
grunting
and
whuffling
there
was
a
silence
webber
made
the
sound
again
on
the
third
try
the
people
came
out
of
the
woods
in
all
there
were
perhaps
of
them
they
came
slowly
and
furtively
moving
a
step
or
two
at
a
time
then
halting
and
peering
prepared
to
run
the
men
came
first
with
one
in
the
lead
a
chap
in
early
middle
age
who
was
apparently
the
chief
the
women
the
old
men
and
the
children
followed
trickling
gradually
out
of
the
shadow
of
the
trees
but
remaining
where
they
could
disappear
in
a
flash
if
alarmed
they
were
all
perfectly
naked
tall
and
slender
and
their
muscles
strung
for
speed
and
agility
rather
than
massive
strength
their
bodies
gleamed
a
light
bronze
color
in
the
sun
and
kieran
noticed
that
the
men
were
beardless
and
both
men
and
women
had
long
hair
ranging
in
color
from
black
to
tawny
and
very
clean
and
glistening
they
were
a
beautiful
people
as
deer
are
a
beautiful
people
graceful
innocent
and
wild
the
men
came
to
the
dried
fruits
which
had
been
scattered
for
them
they
picked
them
up
and
sniffed
them
bit
them
then
began
to
eat
repeating
the
call
the
women
and
children
and
old
men
decided
everything
was
safe
and
joined
them
webber
tossed
out
more
fruit
and
then
got
out
himself
carrying
the
plastic
box
what
does
he
do
next
whispered
kieran
to
paula
scratch
their
ears
i
used
to
tame
squirrels
this
way
when
i
was
a
kid
shut
up
she
warned
him
webber
beckoned
and
she
nudged
him
to
move
out
of
the
flitter
slow
and
careful
kieran
slid
out
of
the
flitter
big
glistening
eyes
swung
to
watch
him
the
eating
stopped
some
of
the
little
ones
scuttled
for
the
trees
kieran
froze
webber
hooted
and
whuffled
some
more
and
the
tension
relaxed
kieran
approached
the
group
with
paula
there
was
suddenly
no
truth
in
what
he
was
doing
he
was
an
actor
in
a
bad
scene
mingling
with
impossible
characters
in
an
improbable
setting
webber
making
ridiculous
noises
and
tossing
his
dried
fruit
around
like
a
caricature
of
somebody
sowing
paula
with
her
brisk
professionalism
all
dissolved
in
fondness
himself
an
alien
in
this
time
and
place
and
these
perfectly
people
behaving
like
with
their
fur
shaved
off
he
started
to
laugh
and
then
thought
better
of
it
once
started
he
might
not
be
able
to
stop
let
them
get
used
to
you
said
webber
softly
paula
obviously
had
been
here
before
she
had
begun
to
make
noises
too
a
modified
hooting
more
like
a
pigeon
call
kieran
just
stood
still
the
people
moved
in
around
them
sniffing
touching
there
was
no
conversation
no
laughing
or
giggling
even
among
the
little
girls
a
particularly
beautiful
young
woman
stood
just
behind
the
chief
watching
the
strangers
with
big
yellow
kieran
took
her
to
be
the
daughter
he
smiled
at
her
she
continued
to
stare
deadpan
and
with
no
answering
flicker
of
a
smile
it
was
as
though
she
had
never
seen
one
before
kieran
shivered
all
this
silence
and
unresponsiveness
became
eerie
i
happy
to
tell
you
he
murmured
to
paula
that
i
do
think
much
of
your
little
pets
she
could
not
allow
herself
to
be
sharply
angry
she
only
said
in
a
whisper
they
are
not
pets
they
are
not
animals
they
she
broke
off
something
had
come
over
the
naked
people
every
head
had
lifted
every
eye
had
turned
away
from
the
strangers
they
were
listening
even
the
littlest
ones
were
still
kieran
could
not
hear
anything
except
the
wind
in
the
trees
what
he
started
to
ask
webber
made
an
imperative
gesture
for
silence
the
tableau
held
for
a
brief
second
longer
then
the
man
who
seemed
to
be
the
leader
made
a
short
harsh
noise
the
people
turned
and
vanished
into
the
trees
the
sakae
webber
said
get
out
of
sight
he
ran
toward
the
flitter
paula
grabbed
kieran
sleeve
and
pushed
him
toward
the
trees
what
going
on
he
demanded
as
he
ran
their
ears
are
better
than
ours
there
a
patrol
ship
coming
i
think
the
shadows
took
them
in
shadows
under
strange
trees
kieran
looked
back
webber
had
been
inside
the
flitter
now
he
tumbled
out
of
the
hatch
and
ran
toward
them
behind
him
the
hatch
closed
and
the
flitter
stirred
and
then
took
off
all
by
itself
humming
they
follow
it
for
a
while
webber
panted
it
may
give
us
a
chance
to
get
away
he
and
paula
started
after
the
running
people
kieran
balked
i
do
know
why
i
running
away
from
anybody
webber
pulled
out
a
instrument
that
looked
enough
like
a
gun
to
be
very
convincing
he
pointed
it
at
kieran
middle
reason
one
he
said
if
the
sakae
catch
paula
and
me
here
we
in
very
big
trouble
reason
two
this
is
a
closed
area
and
you
with
us
so
will
be
in
very
big
trouble
he
looked
coldly
at
kieran
the
first
reason
is
the
one
that
interests
me
most
kieran
shrugged
well
now
i
know
he
ran
only
then
did
he
hear
the
low
heavy
thrumming
in
the
sky
the
sound
came
rumbling
very
swiftly
toward
them
it
was
a
completely
different
sound
from
the
humming
of
the
flitter
and
it
seemed
to
kieran
to
hold
a
note
of
menace
he
stopped
in
a
small
clearing
where
he
might
see
up
through
the
trees
he
wanted
a
look
at
this
ship
or
flier
or
whatever
it
was
that
had
been
built
and
was
flown
by
but
webber
shoved
him
roughly
on
into
a
clump
of
squat
trees
that
were
the
color
of
sherry
wine
with
flat
thick
leaves
do
move
he
said
paula
was
hugging
a
tree
beside
him
she
nodded
to
him
to
do
as
webber
said
they
have
very
powerful
scanners
she
pointed
with
her
chin
look
they
learned
the
harsh
warning
barks
of
the
men
sounded
faintly
then
were
hushed
nothing
moved
except
by
the
natural
motion
of
the
wind
the
people
crouched
among
the
trees
so
still
that
kieran
would
not
have
seen
them
if
he
had
not
known
they
were
there
the
patrol
craft
roared
past
cranking
up
speed
as
it
went
webber
grinned
they
be
a
couple
of
hours
at
least
overhauling
and
examining
the
flitter
by
that
time
it
be
dark
and
by
morning
be
in
the
mountains
the
people
were
already
moving
they
headed
upstream
going
at
a
steady
shuffling
trot
three
of
the
women
kieran
noticed
had
babies
in
their
arms
the
older
children
ran
beside
their
mothers
two
of
the
men
and
several
of
the
women
were
they
ran
also
do
you
like
to
see
them
run
asked
paula
with
a
sharp
note
of
passion
in
her
voice
does
it
look
good
to
you
no
said
kieran
frowning
he
looked
in
the
direction
in
which
the
sound
of
the
patrol
craft
was
vanishing
move
along
webber
said
they
leave
us
far
enough
behind
as
it
is
kieran
followed
the
naked
people
through
the
woods
beside
the
tawny
river
paula
and
webber
jogged
beside
him
the
shadows
were
long
now
reaching
out
across
the
water
paula
kept
glancing
at
him
anxiously
as
though
to
detect
any
sign
of
weakness
on
his
part
you
doing
fine
she
said
you
should
your
body
was
brought
back
to
normal
strength
and
tone
before
you
ever
were
awakened
they
slow
down
when
it
dark
anyway
said
webber
the
old
people
and
the
little
children
ran
strongly
is
their
village
there
kieran
asked
indicating
the
distant
mountains
they
do
live
in
villages
paula
said
but
the
mountains
are
safer
more
places
to
hide
you
said
this
was
a
closed
area
what
is
it
a
hunting
preserve
the
sakae
do
hunt
them
any
more
but
they
used
to
well
webber
said
a
long
time
ago
not
for
food
the
sakae
are
vegetarians
but
but
said
paula
they
were
the
dominant
race
and
the
people
were
simply
beasts
of
the
field
when
they
competed
for
land
and
food
the
people
were
hunted
down
or
driven
out
she
swung
an
expressive
hand
toward
the
landscape
beyond
the
trees
why
do
you
think
they
live
in
this
desert
scraping
a
miserable
existence
along
the
watercourses
land
the
sakae
did
want
now
of
course
they
have
no
objection
to
setting
it
aside
as
a
sort
of
game
preserve
the
humans
are
protected
the
sakae
tell
us
they
living
their
natural
life
in
their
natural
environment
and
when
we
demand
that
a
program
be
she
was
out
of
breath
and
had
to
stop
panting
webber
finished
for
her
we
want
them
taught
lifted
out
of
this
naked
savagery
the
sakae
say
it
impossible
is
it
true
asked
kieran
no
said
paula
fiercely
it
a
matter
of
pride
they
want
to
keep
their
dominance
so
they
simply
wo
admit
that
the
people
are
anything
more
than
animals
and
they
wo
give
them
a
chance
to
be
anything
more
there
was
no
more
talking
after
that
but
even
so
the
three
outlanders
grew
more
and
more
winded
and
the
people
gained
on
them
the
sun
went
down
in
a
blaze
of
light
that
tinted
the
trees
in
even
more
impossible
colors
and
set
the
river
briefly
on
fire
then
night
came
and
just
after
the
darkness
shut
down
the
patrol
craft
returned
beating
up
along
the
winding
river
bed
kieran
froze
under
the
black
trees
and
the
hair
lifted
on
his
skin
for
the
first
time
he
felt
like
a
hunted
thing
for
the
first
time
he
felt
a
personal
anger
the
patrol
craft
drummed
away
and
vanished
they
wo
come
back
until
daylight
webber
said
he
handed
out
little
flat
packets
of
concentrated
food
from
his
pockets
they
munched
as
they
walked
nobody
said
anything
the
wind
which
had
dropped
at
sundown
picked
up
from
a
different
quarter
and
began
to
blow
again
it
got
cold
after
a
while
they
caught
up
with
the
people
who
had
stopped
to
rest
and
eat
the
babies
and
old
people
for
whom
kieran
had
felt
a
worried
pity
were
in
much
better
shape
than
he
he
drank
from
the
river
and
then
sat
down
paula
and
webber
sat
beside
him
on
the
ground
the
wind
blew
hard
from
the
desert
dry
and
chill
the
trees
thrashed
overhead
against
the
pale
glimmer
of
the
water
kieran
could
see
naked
bodies
moving
along
the
river
edge
wading
bending
grubbing
in
the
mud
apparently
they
found
things
for
he
could
see
that
they
were
eating
somewhere
close
by
other
people
were
stripping
fruit
or
nuts
from
the
trees
a
man
picked
up
a
stone
and
pounded
something
with
a
cracking
noise
then
dropped
the
stone
again
they
moved
easily
in
the
dark
as
though
they
were
used
to
it
kieran
recognized
the
leader
daughter
her
beautiful
slender
height
outlined
against
the
water
she
stood
up
to
her
ankles
in
the
soft
mud
holding
something
tight
in
her
two
hands
eating
the
sweat
dried
on
kieran
he
began
to
shiver
you
sure
that
patrol
ship
wo
come
back
he
asked
not
until
they
can
see
what
they
looking
for
then
i
guess
it
safe
he
began
to
scramble
around
feeling
for
dried
sticks
what
are
you
doing
getting
some
firewood
no
paula
was
beside
him
in
an
instant
her
hand
on
his
arm
no
you
must
do
that
but
webber
said
it
is
the
patrol
ship
kieran
it
the
people
they
they
what
i
told
you
they
were
low
on
the
social
scale
this
is
one
of
the
basic
things
they
have
to
be
taught
right
now
they
still
regard
fire
as
a
danger
something
to
run
from
i
see
kieran
said
and
let
the
kindling
fall
very
well
if
i
have
a
fire
i
have
you
your
body
will
warm
me
he
pulled
her
into
his
arms
she
gasped
more
in
astonishment
he
thought
than
alarm
what
are
you
talking
about
that
a
line
from
an
old
movie
from
a
number
of
old
movies
in
fact
not
bad
eh
he
held
her
tight
she
was
definitely
female
after
a
moment
he
pushed
her
away
that
was
a
mistake
i
want
to
be
able
to
go
on
disliking
you
without
any
qualifying
considerations
she
laughed
a
curiously
flat
little
sound
was
everybody
crazy
in
your
day
she
asked
and
then
reed
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
used
his
given
name
what
when
they
threw
the
stones
and
we
got
back
into
the
flitter
you
pushed
me
ahead
of
you
you
were
guarding
me
why
he
stared
at
her
or
rather
at
the
pale
blur
of
her
standing
close
to
him
well
it
always
been
sort
of
the
custom
for
the
men
to
but
now
that
i
think
of
it
webber
did
bother
no
said
paula
back
in
your
day
women
were
still
taking
advantage
of
the
dual
standard
demanding
complete
equality
with
men
but
clinging
to
their
special
status
we
got
beyond
that
do
you
like
it
beyond
i
mean
yes
she
said
it
was
good
of
you
to
do
that
but
webber
said
they
moving
again
come
on
the
people
walked
this
time
strung
out
in
a
long
line
between
the
trees
and
the
water
where
the
light
was
a
little
better
and
the
way
more
open
the
three
outlanders
tagged
behind
clumsy
in
their
boots
and
clothing
the
long
hair
of
the
people
blew
in
the
wind
and
their
bare
feet
padded
softly
light
and
swift
kieran
looked
up
at
the
sky
the
trees
obscured
much
of
it
so
that
all
he
could
see
was
some
scattered
stars
overhead
but
he
thought
that
somewhere
a
moon
was
rising
he
asked
paula
and
she
said
wait
you
see
night
and
the
river
rolled
behind
them
the
moonlight
became
brighter
but
it
was
not
at
all
like
the
moonlight
kieran
remembered
from
long
ago
and
far
away
that
had
had
a
cold
tranquility
to
it
but
this
light
was
neither
cold
nor
tranquil
it
seemed
somehow
to
shift
color
too
which
made
it
even
less
adequate
for
seeing
than
the
white
moonlight
he
was
used
to
sometimes
as
it
filtered
through
the
trees
it
seemed
and
again
it
was
reddish
or
amber
or
blue
they
came
to
a
place
where
the
river
made
a
wide
bend
and
they
cut
across
it
clear
of
the
trees
paula
touched
kieran
arm
and
pointed
look
kieran
looked
and
then
he
stopped
still
the
light
was
not
moonlight
and
its
source
was
not
a
moon
it
was
a
globular
cluster
of
stars
hung
in
the
sky
like
a
swarm
of
fiery
bees
a
burning
and
pulsing
of
many
colors
and
gold
green
and
crimson
peacock
blue
and
smoky
umber
kieran
stared
and
beside
him
paula
murmured
i
been
on
a
lot
of
planets
but
none
of
them
have
anything
like
this
the
people
moved
swiftly
on
paying
no
attention
at
all
to
the
sky
reluctantly
kieran
followed
them
into
the
obscuring
woods
he
kept
looking
at
the
open
sky
above
the
river
waiting
for
the
cluster
to
rise
high
so
he
could
see
it
it
was
some
time
after
this
but
before
the
cluster
rose
clear
of
the
trees
that
kieran
got
the
feeling
that
something
or
someone
was
following
them
he
had
stopped
to
catch
his
breath
and
shake
an
accumulation
of
sand
out
of
his
boots
he
was
leaning
against
a
tree
with
his
back
to
the
wind
which
meant
that
he
was
facing
their
and
he
thought
he
saw
a
shadow
move
where
there
was
nothing
to
cast
a
shadow
he
straightened
up
with
the
little
of
alarm
beating
all
over
him
but
he
could
see
nothing
more
he
thought
he
might
have
been
mistaken
just
the
same
he
ran
to
catch
up
with
the
others
the
people
were
moving
steadily
kieran
knew
that
their
senses
were
far
keener
than
his
and
they
were
obviously
not
aware
of
any
danger
other
than
the
basic
one
of
the
sakae
he
decided
that
he
must
have
been
seeing
things
but
an
uneasiness
persisted
he
dropped
behind
again
this
time
on
purpose
after
they
had
passed
a
clearing
he
stayed
hidden
behind
a
and
watched
the
was
bright
now
but
very
confusing
to
the
eye
he
heard
a
rustling
that
he
did
not
think
was
wind
and
he
thought
that
something
started
to
cross
the
clearing
and
then
stopped
as
though
it
had
caught
his
scent
then
he
thought
that
he
heard
rustlings
at
both
sides
of
the
clearing
stealthy
sounds
of
stalking
that
closed
in
toward
him
only
the
wind
he
told
himself
but
again
he
turned
to
run
this
time
he
met
paula
coming
back
to
look
for
him
reed
are
you
all
right
she
asked
he
caught
her
arm
and
pulled
her
around
and
made
her
run
what
is
it
what
the
matter
i
do
know
he
hurried
with
her
until
he
could
see
webber
ahead
and
beyond
him
the
bare
backs
and
blowing
hair
of
the
people
listen
he
said
are
there
any
predators
here
yes
paula
said
and
webber
turned
sharply
around
have
you
seen
something
i
do
know
i
thought
i
did
i
not
sure
where
behind
us
webber
made
the
harsh
barking
danger
call
and
the
people
stopped
webber
stood
looking
back
the
way
they
had
come
the
women
caught
the
children
and
the
men
fell
back
to
where
webber
stood
they
looked
and
listened
sniffing
the
air
kieran
listened
too
but
now
he
did
not
hear
any
rustlings
except
the
high
thrashing
of
the
branches
nothing
stirred
visibly
and
the
wind
would
carry
away
any
warning
scent
the
men
turned
away
the
people
moved
on
again
webber
shrugged
you
must
have
been
mistaken
kieran
maybe
or
maybe
they
just
ca
think
beyond
the
elementary
if
they
do
smell
it
it
is
there
if
something
is
after
us
it
coming
the
way
any
hunting
animal
works
a
couple
of
the
men
ought
to
circle
around
and
come
on
said
webber
wearily
they
followed
the
people
beside
the
river
the
cluster
was
high
now
a
hive
of
suns
reflected
in
the
flowing
water
a
kaleidoscopic
rippling
of
colors
now
the
women
were
carrying
the
smaller
children
the
ones
too
large
to
be
carried
were
lagging
behind
a
little
so
were
the
aged
not
much
yet
kieran
conscious
that
he
was
weaker
than
the
weakest
of
these
looked
ahead
at
the
dim
bulk
of
the
mountains
and
thought
that
they
ought
to
be
able
to
make
it
he
was
not
at
all
sure
that
he
would
the
river
made
another
bend
the
trail
lay
across
the
bend
clear
of
the
trees
it
was
a
wide
bend
perhaps
two
miles
across
the
neck
ahead
where
the
trail
joined
the
river
again
there
was
a
rocky
hill
something
about
the
outlines
of
the
hill
seemed
wrong
to
kieran
but
it
was
too
far
away
to
be
sure
of
anything
overhead
the
cluster
burned
gloriously
the
people
set
out
across
the
sand
webber
looked
back
you
see
he
said
nothing
they
went
on
kieran
was
beginning
to
feel
very
tired
now
all
the
artificial
strength
that
had
been
pumped
into
him
before
his
awakening
was
running
out
webber
and
paula
walked
with
their
heads
down
striding
determinedly
but
without
joy
what
do
you
think
now
she
asked
kieran
is
this
any
way
for
humans
to
live
the
ragged
line
of
women
and
children
moved
ahead
of
them
with
the
men
in
the
lead
it
was
not
natural
kieran
thought
for
children
to
be
able
to
travel
so
far
and
then
he
remembered
that
the
young
of
species
have
to
be
strong
and
fleet
at
an
early
age
suddenly
one
of
the
women
made
a
harsh
shrill
cry
kieran
looked
where
she
was
looking
off
to
the
left
to
the
river
and
the
curving
line
of
trees
a
large
black
shadow
slipped
across
the
sand
he
looked
behind
him
there
were
other
shadows
coming
with
long
easy
bounds
out
of
the
trees
fanning
out
in
a
shallow
crescent
they
reminded
kieran
of
some
animal
he
had
once
seen
in
a
zoo
a
partly
catlike
partly
doglike
beast
a
cheetah
he
thought
it
had
been
called
only
the
cheetah
was
spotted
like
a
leopard
and
these
creatures
were
black
with
stiff
upstanding
ears
they
bayed
and
the
coursing
began
nothing
said
kieran
bitterly
i
count
seven
webber
said
my
god
i
the
people
ran
they
tried
to
break
back
to
the
river
and
the
trees
that
could
be
climbed
to
safety
but
the
hunters
turned
them
then
they
fled
blindly
forward
toward
the
hill
they
ran
with
all
their
strength
making
no
sound
kieran
and
webber
ran
with
them
with
paula
between
them
webber
seemed
absolutely
appalled
where
that
gun
you
had
kieran
panted
it
not
a
gun
only
a
shocker
he
said
it
would
stop
these
things
look
at
them
they
bounded
sporting
around
them
howling
with
a
sound
like
laughter
they
were
as
large
as
leopards
and
their
eyes
glowed
in
the
they
seemed
to
be
enjoying
themselves
as
though
hunting
was
the
most
delightful
game
in
the
world
one
of
them
ran
up
to
within
two
feet
of
kieran
and
snapped
at
him
with
its
great
jaws
dodging
agilely
when
he
raised
his
arm
they
drove
the
people
faster
and
faster
at
first
the
men
had
formed
around
the
women
and
children
but
the
formation
began
to
disintegrate
as
the
weaker
ones
dropped
behind
and
no
attempt
was
made
to
keep
it
panic
was
stronger
than
instinct
now
kieran
looked
ahead
if
we
can
make
it
to
that
hill
illustration
paula
screamed
and
he
stumbled
over
a
child
a
girl
about
five
crawling
on
her
hands
and
knees
he
picked
her
up
she
bit
and
thrashed
and
tore
at
him
her
bare
little
body
hard
as
whalebone
and
slippery
with
sweat
he
could
not
hold
onto
her
she
kicked
herself
free
of
his
hands
and
rushed
wildly
out
of
reach
and
one
of
the
black
hunters
pounced
in
and
bore
her
away
shrieking
thinly
like
a
fledgling
bird
in
the
jaws
of
a
cat
oh
my
god
said
paula
and
covered
her
head
with
her
arms
trying
to
shut
out
sight
and
sound
he
caught
her
and
said
harshly
do
faint
because
i
ca
carry
you
the
child
mother
whichever
of
the
women
it
might
have
been
did
not
look
back
an
old
woman
who
strayed
aside
was
pulled
down
and
dragged
off
and
then
one
of
the
men
the
hill
was
closer
kieran
saw
now
what
was
wrong
with
it
part
of
it
was
a
building
he
was
too
tired
and
too
sick
to
be
interested
except
as
it
offered
a
refuge
he
spoke
to
webber
with
great
difficulty
because
he
was
winded
and
then
he
realized
that
webber
was
there
webber
had
stumbled
and
fallen
he
had
started
to
get
up
but
the
hunters
were
on
him
he
was
on
his
hands
and
knees
facing
them
screaming
at
them
to
get
away
from
him
he
had
obviously
had
little
or
no
experience
with
raw
violence
kieran
ran
back
to
him
with
paula
close
behind
use
your
gun
he
yelled
he
was
afraid
of
the
black
hunters
but
he
was
full
of
rage
and
the
rage
outweighed
the
fear
he
yelled
at
them
cursing
them
he
hurled
sand
into
their
eyes
and
one
that
was
creeping
up
on
webber
from
the
side
he
kicked
the
creature
drew
off
a
little
not
frightened
but
surprised
they
were
not
used
to
this
sort
of
thing
from
humans
your
gun
kieran
roared
again
and
webber
pulled
the
thing
out
of
his
pocket
he
stood
up
and
said
unsteadily
i
told
you
it
not
a
gun
it
wo
kill
anything
i
do
think
use
it
said
kieran
and
get
moving
again
slowly
they
started
to
move
and
then
across
the
sky
a
great
iron
voice
spoke
like
thunder
lie
down
it
said
please
lie
down
flat
kieran
turned
his
head
startled
from
the
direction
of
the
building
on
the
hill
a
vehicle
was
speeding
toward
them
the
sakae
said
webber
with
what
was
almost
a
sob
of
relief
lie
down
as
he
did
so
kieran
saw
a
pale
flash
shoot
out
from
the
vehicle
and
knock
over
a
hunter
still
hanging
on
the
flanks
of
the
fleeing
people
he
hugged
the
sand
something
went
whining
and
whistling
over
him
there
was
a
thunk
and
a
screech
it
was
repeated
and
then
the
iron
voice
spoke
again
you
may
get
up
now
please
remain
where
you
are
the
vehicle
was
much
closer
they
were
bathed
in
sudden
light
the
voice
said
webber
you
are
holding
a
weapon
please
drop
it
it
only
a
little
shocker
webber
said
plaintively
he
dropped
it
the
vehicle
had
wide
tracks
that
threw
up
clouds
of
sand
it
came
clanking
to
a
halt
kieran
shading
his
eyes
thought
he
distinguished
two
creatures
inside
a
driver
and
a
passenger
the
passenger
emerged
climbing
with
some
difficulty
over
the
steep
step
of
the
track
his
tail
rattling
down
behind
him
like
a
length
of
thick
cable
once
on
the
ground
he
became
quite
agile
moving
with
a
sort
of
oddly
graceful
prance
on
his
powerful
legs
he
approached
his
attention
centered
on
kieran
but
he
observed
the
amenities
placing
one
delicate
hand
on
his
breast
and
making
a
slight
bow
doctor
ray
his
muzzle
shaped
something
like
a
duck
bill
nevertheless
formed
paula
name
tolerably
well
and
you
i
think
are
mr
kieran
kieran
said
yes
the
blazed
overhead
the
dead
beasts
lay
behind
him
the
people
with
their
flying
hair
had
run
on
beyond
his
sight
he
had
been
dead
for
a
hundred
years
and
now
he
was
alive
again
now
he
was
standing
on
alien
soil
facing
an
alien
form
of
life
communicating
with
it
and
he
was
so
and
every
sensory
nerve
was
so
thoroughly
flayed
that
he
had
nothing
left
to
react
with
he
simply
looked
at
the
saka
as
he
might
have
looked
at
a
and
said
yes
the
saka
made
his
formal
little
bow
again
i
am
bregg
he
shook
his
head
i
glad
i
was
able
to
reach
you
in
time
you
people
do
seem
to
have
any
notion
of
the
amount
of
trouble
you
make
for
us
paula
who
had
not
spoken
since
the
child
was
carried
off
suddenly
screamed
at
bregg
murderer
she
sprang
at
him
striking
him
in
blind
hysteria
bregg
sighed
he
caught
paula
in
those
fine
small
hands
that
seemed
to
have
amazing
strength
and
held
her
at
arm
length
doctor
ray
he
said
he
shook
her
doctor
ray
she
stopped
screaming
i
do
wish
to
administer
a
sedative
because
then
you
will
say
that
i
drugged
you
but
i
will
if
i
must
kieran
said
i
keep
her
quiet
he
took
her
from
bregg
she
collapsed
against
him
and
began
to
cry
murderers
she
whispered
that
little
girl
those
old
people
webber
said
you
could
exterminate
those
beasts
you
do
have
to
let
them
hunt
the
people
like
that
it
it
unhuman
is
the
word
you
want
said
bregg
his
voice
was
exceedingly
weary
please
get
into
the
car
they
climbed
in
the
car
churned
around
and
sped
back
toward
the
building
paula
shivered
and
kieran
held
her
in
his
arms
webber
said
after
a
moment
or
two
how
did
you
happen
to
be
here
bregg
when
we
caught
the
flitter
and
found
it
empty
it
was
obvious
that
you
were
with
the
people
and
it
became
imperative
to
find
you
before
you
came
to
harm
i
remembered
that
the
trail
ran
close
by
this
old
outpost
building
so
i
had
the
patrol
ship
drop
us
here
with
an
emergency
vehicle
kieran
said
you
knew
the
people
were
coming
this
way
of
course
bregg
sounded
surprised
they
migrate
every
year
at
the
beginning
of
the
dry
season
how
do
you
suppose
webber
found
them
so
easily
kieran
looked
at
webber
he
asked
then
they
were
running
from
the
sakae
of
course
they
were
paula
said
you
saw
them
yourself
cowering
under
the
trees
when
the
ship
went
over
the
patrol
ships
frighten
them
bregg
said
sometimes
to
the
point
of
stampeding
them
which
is
why
we
use
them
only
in
emergencies
the
people
do
not
connect
the
ships
with
us
that
said
paula
flatly
is
a
lie
bregg
sighed
enthusiasts
always
believe
what
they
want
to
believe
come
and
see
for
yourself
she
straightened
up
what
have
you
done
to
them
we
caught
them
in
a
trap
said
bregg
and
we
are
presently
going
to
stick
needles
into
them
a
procedure
necessitated
by
your
presence
doctor
ray
they
highly
susceptible
to
imported
viruses
as
you
should
remember
one
of
your
little
parties
of
succeeded
in
wiping
out
a
whole
band
of
them
not
too
many
years
ago
so
inoculations
and
quarantine
lights
had
blazed
up
in
the
area
near
the
building
the
car
sped
toward
them
kieran
said
slowly
why
do
you
just
exterminate
the
hunters
and
have
done
with
them
in
your
day
kieran
yes
i
heard
all
about
you
in
your
day
did
you
on
earth
exterminate
the
predators
so
that
their
natural
prey
might
live
more
happily
bregg
long
muzzle
and
sloping
skull
were
profiled
against
the
lights
no
said
kieran
we
did
but
in
that
case
they
were
all
animals
exactly
said
bregg
no
wait
doctor
ray
spare
me
the
lecture
i
can
give
you
a
much
better
reason
than
that
one
even
you
ca
quarrel
with
it
a
matter
of
ecology
the
number
of
humans
destroyed
by
these
predators
annually
is
negligible
but
they
do
themselves
destroy
an
enormous
number
of
small
creatures
with
which
the
humans
compete
for
their
food
if
we
exterminated
the
hunters
the
small
animals
would
multiply
so
rapidly
that
the
humans
would
starve
to
death
the
car
stopped
beside
the
hill
at
the
edge
of
the
lighted
area
a
sort
of
makeshift
corral
of
wire
fencing
had
been
set
up
with
wide
wings
to
funnel
the
people
into
the
enclosure
where
a
gate
was
shut
on
them
two
sakae
were
mounting
guard
as
the
party
from
the
car
approached
the
corral
inside
the
fence
kieran
could
see
the
people
flopped
around
in
positions
of
exhaustion
they
did
not
seem
to
be
afraid
now
a
few
of
them
were
drinking
from
a
supply
of
water
provided
for
them
there
was
food
scattered
for
them
on
the
ground
bregg
said
something
in
his
own
language
to
one
of
the
guards
who
looked
surprised
and
questioned
him
then
departed
springing
strongly
on
his
powerful
legs
wait
said
bregg
they
waited
and
in
a
moment
or
two
the
guard
came
back
leading
one
of
the
black
hunting
beasts
on
a
chain
it
was
a
female
somewhat
smaller
than
the
ones
kieran
had
fought
with
and
having
a
slash
of
white
on
the
throat
and
chest
she
howled
and
sprang
up
on
bregg
butting
her
great
head
into
his
shoulder
wriggling
with
delight
he
petted
her
talking
to
her
and
she
laughed
doglike
and
licked
his
cheek
they
domesticate
well
he
said
we
had
a
tame
breed
for
centuries
he
moved
a
little
closer
to
the
corral
holding
tight
to
the
chain
suddenly
she
became
aware
of
the
people
instantly
the
pet
turned
into
a
snarling
fury
she
reared
on
her
hind
legs
and
screamed
and
inside
the
corral
the
people
roused
up
they
were
not
frightened
now
they
spat
and
chattered
clawing
up
sand
and
pebbles
and
bits
of
food
to
throw
through
the
fence
bregg
handed
the
chain
to
the
guard
who
hauled
the
animal
away
by
main
force
paula
said
coldly
if
your
point
was
that
the
people
are
not
kind
to
animals
my
answer
is
that
you
can
hardly
blame
them
a
year
ago
bregg
said
some
of
the
people
got
hold
of
her
two
young
ones
they
were
torn
to
pieces
before
they
could
be
saved
and
she
saw
it
i
ca
blame
her
either
he
went
on
to
the
gate
and
opened
it
and
went
inside
the
people
drew
back
from
him
they
spat
at
him
too
and
pelted
him
with
food
and
pebbles
he
spoke
to
them
sternly
in
the
tone
of
one
speaking
to
unruly
dogs
and
he
spoke
words
in
his
own
tongue
the
people
began
to
shuffle
about
uneasily
they
stopped
throwing
things
he
stood
waiting
the
girl
came
sidling
forward
and
rubbed
herself
against
his
thigh
head
shoulder
and
flank
he
reached
down
and
stroked
her
and
she
whimpered
with
pleasure
and
arched
her
back
oh
for
god
sake
said
kieran
let
get
out
of
here
later
they
sat
wearily
on
fallen
blocks
of
cement
inside
a
dusty
shadowy
room
of
the
old
building
only
a
dispelled
the
gloom
and
the
wind
whispered
coldly
and
bregg
walked
to
and
fro
in
his
curious
prance
as
he
talked
it
will
be
a
little
while
before
the
necessary
medical
team
can
be
picked
up
and
brought
here
he
said
we
shall
have
to
wait
and
then
asked
kieran
first
to
bregg
used
a
word
that
undoubtedly
named
a
city
of
the
sakae
but
that
meant
nothing
to
kieran
and
then
to
altair
two
this
of
course
is
a
council
matter
he
stopped
and
looked
with
bright
shrewd
eyes
at
kieran
you
are
quite
the
sensation
already
kieran
the
whole
community
of
starworlds
is
already
aware
of
the
illegal
resuscitation
of
one
of
the
pioneer
spacemen
and
of
course
there
is
great
interest
he
paused
you
yourself
have
done
nothing
unlawful
you
can
not
very
well
be
sent
back
to
sleep
and
undoubtedly
the
council
will
want
to
hear
you
i
am
curious
as
to
what
you
will
say
about
sako
said
kieran
about
them
he
made
a
gesture
toward
a
window
through
which
the
wind
brought
the
sound
of
stirring
of
the
gruntings
and
whufflings
of
the
corralled
people
yes
about
them
i
tell
you
how
i
feel
kieran
said
flatly
he
saw
paula
and
webber
lean
forward
in
the
shadows
i
a
human
man
the
people
out
there
may
be
savage
low
as
the
beasts
good
for
nothing
the
way
they
are
but
they
human
you
sakae
may
be
intelligent
civilized
reasonable
but
you
not
human
when
i
see
you
ordering
them
around
like
beasts
i
want
to
kill
you
that
how
i
feel
bregg
did
not
change
his
bearing
but
he
made
a
small
sound
that
was
almost
a
sigh
yes
he
said
i
feared
it
would
be
so
a
man
of
your
times
a
man
from
a
world
where
humans
were
would
feel
that
way
he
turned
and
looked
at
paula
and
webber
it
appears
that
your
scheme
to
this
extent
was
successful
no
i
would
say
that
said
kieran
paula
stood
up
but
you
just
told
us
how
you
feel
and
it
the
truth
said
kieran
but
there
something
else
he
looked
thoughtfully
at
her
it
was
a
good
idea
it
was
bound
to
work
a
man
of
my
time
was
bound
to
feel
just
this
way
you
wanted
him
to
feel
and
would
go
away
from
here
crying
your
party
slogans
and
believing
them
but
you
overlooked
something
he
paused
looking
out
the
window
into
the
sky
at
the
faint
radiance
of
the
cluster
you
overlooked
the
fact
that
when
you
awoke
me
i
would
no
longer
be
a
man
of
my
own
time
or
of
any
time
i
was
in
darkness
for
a
hundred
years
with
the
stars
my
brothers
and
no
man
touching
me
maybe
that
chills
a
man
feelings
maybe
something
deep
in
his
mind
lives
and
has
time
to
think
i
told
you
how
i
feel
yes
but
i
have
told
you
what
i
think
he
stopped
again
then
said
the
people
out
there
in
the
corral
have
my
form
and
my
instinctive
loyalty
is
to
them
but
instinct
is
enough
it
would
have
kept
us
in
the
mud
of
earth
forever
if
it
could
reason
took
us
out
to
the
wider
universe
instinct
tells
me
that
those
out
there
are
my
people
reason
tells
me
that
you
he
looked
at
bregg
who
are
abhorrent
to
me
who
would
make
my
skin
creep
if
i
touched
you
you
who
go
by
reason
that
you
are
my
real
people
instinct
made
a
hell
of
earth
for
millennia
i
say
we
ought
to
leave
it
behind
us
there
in
the
mud
and
not
let
it
make
a
hell
of
the
stars
for
you
run
into
this
same
problem
over
and
over
again
as
you
go
out
into
the
wider
universe
and
the
old
parochial
human
loyalties
must
be
altered
to
solve
it
he
looked
at
paula
and
said
i
sorry
but
if
anyone
asks
me
that
is
what
i
say
i
sorry
too
she
said
rage
and
dejection
ringing
in
her
voice
sorry
we
woke
you
i
hope
i
never
see
you
again
kieran
shrugged
after
all
you
did
wake
me
you
responsible
for
me
here
i
am
facing
a
whole
new
universe
and
i
need
you
he
went
over
and
patted
her
shoulder
damn
you
she
said
but
she
did
not
move
away
from
him
