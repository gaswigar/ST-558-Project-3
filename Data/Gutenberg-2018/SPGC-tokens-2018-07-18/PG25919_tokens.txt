from
which
miss

so
often
and
so
ominously
looked

the
front
of

house

ahead
the
steep
cobbled
way
with
a
glimpse
of
the
high
street
at
the
end

right
the
crooked
chimney
and
the
church

was

i
miss
elizabeth
mapp
might
have
been
forty
and
she
had
taken
advantage
of
this
opportunity
by
being
just
a
year
or
two
older
her
face
was
of
high
vivid
colour
and
was
corrugated
by
chronic
rage
and
curiosity
but
these
vivifying
emotions
had
preserved
to
her
an
astonishing
activity
of
mind
and
body
which
fully
accounted
for
the
comparative
adolescence
with
which
she
would
have
been
credited
anywhere
except
in
the
charming
little
town
which
she
had
inhabited
so
long
anger
and
the
gravest
suspicions
about
everybody
had
kept
her
young
and
on
the
boil
she
sat
on
this
hot
july
morning
like
a
large
bird
of
prey
at
the
very
convenient
window
of
her
the
ample
bow
of
which
formed
a
strategical
point
of
high
value
this
solid
and
spacious
was
built
at
right
angles
to
the
front
of
her
house
and
looked
straight
down
the
very
interesting
street
which
debouched
at
its
lower
end
into
the
high
street
of
tilling
exactly
opposite
her
front
door
the
road
turned
sharply
so
that
as
she
looked
out
from
this
projecting
window
her
own
house
was
at
right
angles
on
her
left
the
street
in
question
plunged
steeply
downwards
in
front
of
her
and
to
her
right
she
commanded
an
uninterrupted
view
of
its
further
course
which
terminated
in
the
disused
graveyard
surrounding
the
big
norman
church
anything
of
interest
about
the
church
however
could
be
gleaned
from
a
and
miss
mapp
did
not
occupy
herself
much
with
such
coldly
venerable
topics
far
more
to
her
mind
was
the
fact
that
between
the
church
and
her
strategic
window
was
the
cottage
in
which
her
gardener
lived
and
she
could
thus
see
when
not
otherwise
engaged
whether
he
went
home
before
twelve
or
failed
to
get
back
to
her
garden
again
by
one
for
he
had
to
cross
the
street
in
front
of
her
very
eyes
similarly
she
could
observe
whether
any
of
his
abandoned
family
ever
came
out
from
her
garden
door
weighted
with
suspicious
baskets
which
might
contain
smuggled
vegetables
only
yesterday
morning
she
had
hurried
forth
with
a
dangerous
smile
to
intercept
a
laden
urchin
with
inquiries
as
to
what
was
in
that
nice
basket
on
that
occasion
that
nice
basket
had
proved
to
contain
a
strawberry
net
which
was
being
sent
for
repair
to
the
gardener
wife
so
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
except
verify
its
return
this
she
did
from
a
side
window
of
the
which
commanded
the
strawberry
beds
she
could
sit
quite
close
to
that
for
it
was
screened
by
the
branches
of
a
and
she
could
spy
unseen
otherwise
this
road
to
the
right
leading
up
to
the
church
was
of
no
great
importance
except
on
sunday
morning
when
she
could
get
a
practically
complete
list
of
those
who
attended
divine
service
for
no
one
of
real
interest
lived
in
the
humble
dwellings
which
lined
it
to
the
left
was
the
front
of
her
own
house
at
right
angles
to
the
strategic
window
and
with
regard
to
that
a
good
many
useful
observations
might
be
and
were
made
she
could
from
behind
a
curtain
negligently
across
the
side
of
the
window
nearest
the
house
have
an
eye
on
her
housemaid
at
work
and
notice
if
she
leaned
out
of
a
window
or
made
remarks
to
a
friend
passing
in
the
street
or
waved
salutations
with
a
duster
swift
upon
such
discoveries
she
would
execute
a
flank
march
across
the
few
steps
of
garden
and
steal
into
the
house
noiselessly
ascend
the
stairs
and
catch
the
offender
at
this
public
dalliance
but
all
such
domestic
espionage
to
right
and
left
was
flavourless
and
insipid
compared
to
the
tremendous
discoveries
which
daily
and
hourly
awaited
the
trained
observer
of
the
street
that
lay
directly
in
front
of
her
window
there
was
little
that
concerned
the
social
movements
of
tilling
that
could
not
be
proved
or
at
least
reasonably
conjectured
from
miss
mapp
eyrie
just
below
her
house
on
the
left
stood
major
residence
of
georgian
red
brick
like
her
own
and
opposite
was
that
of
captain
puffin
they
were
both
bachelors
though
major
flint
was
generally
supposed
to
have
been
the
hero
of
some
amazingly
amorous
adventures
in
early
life
and
always
turned
the
subject
with
great
abruptness
when
anything
connected
with
duelling
was
mentioned
it
was
not
therefore
unreasonable
to
infer
that
he
had
had
experiences
of
a
bloody
sort
and
colour
was
added
to
this
romantic
conjecture
by
the
fact
that
in
damp
rheumatic
weather
his
left
arm
was
very
stiff
and
he
had
been
known
to
say
that
his
wound
troubled
him
what
wound
that
was
no
one
exactly
knew
it
might
have
been
anything
from
a
vaccination
mark
to
a
for
having
said
that
his
wound
troubled
him
he
would
invariably
add
pshaw
that
enough
about
an
old
campaigner
and
though
he
might
subsequently
talk
of
nothing
else
except
the
old
campaigner
he
drew
a
veil
over
his
old
campaigns
that
he
had
seen
service
in
india
was
indeed
probable
by
his
referring
to
lunch
as
tiffin
and
calling
to
his
with
the
ejaculation
of
as
her
name
was
sarah
this
was
clearly
a
reminiscence
of
days
in
bungalows
when
not
in
a
rage
his
manner
to
his
own
sex
was
bluff
and
hearty
but
whether
in
a
rage
or
not
his
manner
to
the
fairies
or
lovely
women
was
gallant
and
pompous
in
the
extreme
he
certainly
had
a
lock
of
hair
in
a
small
gold
specimen
case
on
his
and
had
been
seen
to
kiss
it
when
rather
carelessly
he
thought
that
he
was
unobserved
miss
mapp
eye
as
she
took
her
seat
in
her
window
on
this
sunny
july
morning
lingered
for
a
moment
on
the
major
house
before
she
proceeded
to
give
a
disgusted
glance
at
the
pictures
on
the
back
page
of
her
morning
illustrated
paper
which
chiefly
represented
young
women
dancing
in
rings
in
the
surf
or
lying
on
the
beach
in
attitudes
which
miss
mapp
would
have
scorned
to
adjust
herself
to
neither
the
major
nor
captain
puffin
were
very
early
risers
but
it
was
about
time
that
the
first
signals
of
animation
might
be
expected
indeed
at
this
moment
she
quite
distinctly
heard
that
muffled
roar
which
to
her
experienced
ear
was
easily
interpreted
to
be
so
the
major
has
just
come
down
to
breakfast
she
mechanically
inferred
and
it
close
on
ten
let
me
see
tuesday
thursday
saturday
porridge
morning
her
penetrating
glance
shifted
to
the
house
exactly
opposite
to
that
in
which
it
was
porridge
morning
and
even
as
she
looked
a
hand
was
thrust
out
of
a
small
upper
window
and
deposited
a
sponge
on
the
sill
then
from
the
inside
the
lower
sash
was
thrust
firmly
down
so
as
to
prevent
the
sponge
from
blowing
away
and
falling
into
the
street
captain
puffin
it
was
therefore
clear
was
a
little
later
than
the
major
that
morning
but
he
always
shaved
and
brushed
his
teeth
before
his
bath
so
that
there
was
but
a
few
minutes
between
them
general
manoeuvres
in
tilling
the
gradual
burstings
of
fluttering
life
from
the
chrysalis
of
the
night
the
emergence
of
the
ladies
of
the
town
with
their
in
their
hands
for
housekeeping
purchases
the
exodus
of
men
to
catch
the
out
to
the
golf
links
and
other
first
steps
in
the
duties
and
diversions
of
the
day
did
not
get
into
full
swing
till
ten
and
miss
mapp
had
ample
time
to
skim
the
headlines
of
her
paper
and
indulge
in
chaste
meditations
about
the
occupants
of
these
two
houses
before
she
need
really
make
herself
alert
to
miss
nothing
of
the
two
major
flint
without
doubt
was
the
more
attractive
to
the
feminine
sense
for
years
miss
mapp
had
tried
to
cajole
him
into
marrying
her
and
had
not
nearly
finished
yet
with
his
record
of
adventure
with
the
romantic
reek
of
india
and
camphor
in
the
of
the
rugs
that
strewed
his
hall
and
surged
like
a
rising
tide
up
the
wall
with
his
haughty
and
gallant
manner
with
his
loud
pshawings
and
sniffs
at
nonsense
and
balderdash
his
thumpings
on
the
table
to
emphasize
an
argument
with
his
wound
and
his
prodigious
swipes
at
golf
his
intolerance
of
any
who
believed
in
ghosts
microbes
or
vegetarianism
there
was
something
dashing
and
risky
about
him
you
felt
that
you
were
in
the
presence
of
some
hot
coal
straight
from
the
furnace
of
creation
captain
puffin
on
the
other
hand
was
of
clay
so
different
that
he
could
hardly
be
considered
to
be
made
of
clay
at
all
he
was
lame
and
short
and
meagre
with
strings
of
peaceful
beads
and
papuan
aprons
in
his
hall
instead
of
wild
and
had
a
jerky
inattentive
manner
and
a
high
pitched
voice
yet
to
miss
mapp
mind
there
was
something
behind
his
unimpressiveness
that
had
a
mysterious
quality
all
the
more
so
because
nothing
of
it
appeared
on
the
surface
nobody
could
call
major
flint
with
his
bawlings
and
his
sniffings
the
least
mysterious
he
laid
all
his
loud
cards
on
the
table
great
hulking
kings
and
aces
but
miss
mapp
felt
far
from
sure
that
captain
puffin
did
not
hold
a
joker
which
would
some
time
come
to
light
the
idea
of
being
puffin
was
not
so
attractive
as
the
other
but
she
occasionally
gave
it
her
remote
consideration
yet
there
was
mystery
about
them
both
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
most
of
their
movements
were
so
amply
accounted
for
as
a
rule
they
played
golf
together
in
the
morning
reposed
in
the
afternoon
as
could
easily
be
verified
by
anyone
standing
on
a
still
day
in
the
road
between
their
houses
and
listening
to
the
loud
and
rhythmical
breathings
that
fanned
the
tranquil
air
certainly
went
out
to
afterwards
and
played
bridge
till
or
if
no
such
entertainment
was
proffered
them
occupied
at
the
country
club
or
laboriously
amassed
a
hundred
at
billiards
though
were
profuse
dining
out
was
very
rare
at
tilling
patience
or
a
puzzle
occupied
the
hour
or
two
that
intervened
between
domestic
supper
and
but
again
and
again
miss
mapp
had
seen
lights
burning
in
the
of
those
two
neighbours
at
an
hour
when
such
lights
as
were
still
in
evidence
at
tilling
were
strictly
confined
to
bedrooms
and
should
indeed
have
been
extinguished
there
and
only
last
week
being
plucked
from
slumber
by
some
unaccountable
indigestion
for
which
she
blamed
a
small
green
apple
she
had
seen
at
no
less
than
in
the
morning
the
lights
in
captain
puffin
still
shining
through
the
blind
this
had
excited
her
so
much
that
at
risk
of
toppling
into
the
street
she
had
craned
her
neck
from
her
window
and
observed
a
similar
illumination
in
the
house
of
major
flint
they
were
not
together
then
for
in
that
case
any
prudent
householder
and
god
knew
that
they
both
of
them
scraped
and
saved
enough
or
if
he
did
know
miss
mapp
did
would
have
quenched
his
own
lights
if
he
were
talking
to
his
friend
in
his
friend
house
the
next
night
the
pangs
of
indigestion
having
completely
vanished
she
set
her
alarum
clock
at
the
same
timeless
hour
and
had
observed
exactly
the
same
phenomenon
such
late
hours
of
course
amply
accounted
for
these
late
breakfasts
but
why
so
miss
mapp
pithily
asked
herself
why
these
late
hours
of
course
they
both
kept
whereas
most
of
tilling
utterly
refused
except
when
going
by
train
to
alter
their
watches
because
lloyd
george
told
them
to
but
even
allowing
for
that
then
she
perceived
that
made
it
later
than
ever
for
its
adherents
so
that
was
no
excuse
miss
mapp
had
a
mind
that
was
incapable
of
believing
the
improbable
and
the
current
explanation
of
these
late
hours
was
very
improbable
indeed
major
flint
often
told
the
world
in
general
that
he
was
revising
his
diaries
and
that
the
only
uninterrupted
time
which
he
could
find
in
this
pleasant
whirl
of
life
at
tilling
was
when
he
was
alone
in
the
evening
captain
puffin
on
his
part
confessed
to
a
student
curiosity
about
the
ancient
history
of
tilling
with
regard
to
which
he
was
preparing
a
monograph
he
could
talk
when
permitted
by
the
hour
about
the
reclamation
from
the
sea
of
the
marsh
land
south
of
the
town
and
about
the
old
roman
road
which
was
built
on
a
raised
causeway
of
which
traces
remained
but
it
argued
so
thought
miss
mapp
an
unprecedented
egoism
on
the
part
of
major
flint
and
an
equally
unprecedented
love
of
antiquities
on
the
part
of
captain
puffin
that
they
should
prosecute
their
studies
with
gas
at
the
present
price
till
such
hours
no
miss
mapp
knew
better
than
that
but
she
had
not
made
up
her
mind
exactly
what
it
was
that
she
knew
she
mentally
rejected
the
idea
that
egoism
even
in
these
days
of
diaries
and
autobiographies
and
antiquities
accounted
for
so
much
study
with
the
same
healthy
intolerance
with
which
a
vigorous
stomach
rejects
unwholesome
food
and
did
not
allow
herself
to
be
insidiously
poisoned
by
its
retention
but
as
she
took
up
her
light
aluminium
to
make
sure
whether
it
was
isabel
poppit
or
not
who
was
now
stepping
with
that
high
prancing
tread
into
the
stationer
in
the
high
street
she
exclaimed
to
herself
for
the
three
hundred
and
time
after
breakfast
it
very
baffling
for
it
was
precisely
a
year
since
she
had
first
seen
those
mysterious
midnight
squares
of
illuminated
blind
baffling
in
fact
was
a
word
that
constantly
made
short
appearances
in
miss
vocabulary
though
its
retention
for
a
whole
year
over
one
subject
was
unprecedented
but
never
yet
had
baffled
sullied
her
wells
of
pure
undefiled
english
movement
had
begun
plaistow
carrying
her
wicker
basket
came
round
the
corner
by
the
church
in
the
direction
of
miss
mapp
window
and
as
there
was
a
temporary
coolness
between
them
following
violent
heat
with
regard
to
some
worsted
of
brilliant
hue
which
a
forgetful
draper
had
sold
to
plaistow
having
definitely
promised
it
to
miss
mapp
but
miss
mapp
scorned
to
recall
the
sordid
details
of
this
paltry
appropriation
the
heat
had
quite
subsided
and
miss
mapp
was
for
her
part
quite
prepared
to
let
the
coolness
regain
the
normal
temperature
of
cordiality
the
moment
that
plaistow
returned
that
worsted
outwardly
and
publicly
friendly
relationships
had
been
resumed
and
as
the
coolness
had
lasted
six
weeks
or
so
it
was
probable
that
the
worsted
had
already
been
incorporated
into
the
ornamental
border
of
plaistow
jumper
or
winter
scarf
and
a
proper
expression
of
regret
would
have
to
do
instead
so
the
nearer
plaistow
approached
the
more
invisible
she
became
to
miss
mapp
eye
and
when
she
was
within
saluting
distance
had
vanished
altogether
simultaneously
miss
poppit
came
out
of
the
stationer
in
the
high
street
plaistow
turned
the
corner
below
miss
mapp
window
and
went
bobbing
along
down
the
steep
hill
she
walked
with
the
motion
of
those
mechanical
dolls
sold
in
the
street
which
have
three
legs
set
as
spokes
to
a
circle
so
that
their
feet
emerge
from
their
dress
with
dutch
and
rigid
regularity
and
her
figure
had
a
certain
squat
rotundity
that
suited
her
gait
she
distinctly
looked
into
captain
puffin
window
as
she
passed
and
with
the
misplaced
juvenility
so
characteristic
of
her
waggled
her
plump
little
hand
at
it
at
the
corner
beyond
major
flint
house
she
hesitated
a
moment
and
turned
off
down
the
entry
into
the
side
street
where
wyse
lived
the
dentist
lived
there
too
and
as
wyse
was
away
on
the
continent
of
europe
plaistow
was
almost
certain
to
be
visiting
the
other
rapidly
miss
mapp
remembered
that
at
bartlett
bridge
party
yesterday
plaistow
had
selected
soft
chocolates
for
consumption
instead
of
those
stuffed
with
nougat
or
almonds
that
furnished
additional
evidence
for
the
dentist
for
generally
you
could
not
get
a
nougat
chocolate
at
all
if
godiva
plaistow
had
been
in
the
room
for
more
than
a
minute
or
two
as
she
crossed
the
narrow
cobbled
roadway
with
the
grass
growing
luxuriantly
between
the
rounded
pebbles
she
stumbled
and
recovered
herself
with
a
swift
little
forward
run
and
the
circular
feet
twinkled
with
the
rapidity
of
those
of
a
thrush
scudding
over
the
lawn
by
this
time
isabel
poppit
had
advanced
as
far
as
the
fish
shop
three
doors
below
the
turning
down
which
plaistow
had
vanished
her
prancing
progress
paused
there
for
a
moment
and
she
waited
with
one
knee
highly
elevated
like
a
statue
of
a
curveting
horse
before
she
finally
decided
to
pass
on
but
she
passed
no
further
than
the
fruit
shop
next
door
and
took
the
three
steps
that
elevated
it
from
the
street
in
a
single
prance
with
her
roman
nose
high
in
the
air
presently
she
emerged
but
with
no
obvious
rotundity
like
that
of
a
melon
projecting
from
her
basket
so
that
miss
mapp
could
see
exactly
what
she
had
purchased
and
went
back
to
the
fish
shop
again
surely
she
would
not
put
fish
on
the
top
of
fruit
and
even
as
miss
mapp
lucid
intelligence
rejected
this
supposition
the
true
solution
struck
her
ice
she
said
to
herself
and
sure
enough
projecting
from
the
top
of
miss
poppit
basket
when
she
came
out
was
an
angular
peak
wrapped
up
in
paper
already
wet
miss
poppit
came
up
the
street
and
miss
mapp
put
up
her
illustrated
paper
again
with
the
revolting
picture
of
the
brighton
turned
towards
the
window
peeping
out
behind
it
she
observed
that
miss
poppit
basket
was
apparently
oozing
with
bright
venous
blood
and
felt
certain
that
she
had
bought
red
currants
that
coupled
with
the
ice
made
conjecture
complete
she
had
bought
red
currants
slightly
damaged
or
they
would
not
have
oozed
so
speedily
in
order
to
make
that
iced
fool
of
which
she
had
so
freely
partaken
at
miss
mapp
last
bridge
party
that
was
a
very
scurvy
trick
for
iced
fool
was
an
invention
of
miss
mapp
who
when
it
was
praised
said
that
she
inherited
the
recipe
from
her
grandmother
but
miss
poppit
had
evidently
entered
the
lists
against
grandmamma
mapp
and
she
had
as
evidently
guessed
that
quite
inferior
fruit
fruit
that
was
distinctly
off
was
undetectable
when
severely
iced
miss
mapp
could
only
hope
that
the
fruit
in
the
basket
now
bobbing
past
her
window
was
so
much
off
that
it
had
begun
to
ferment
fermented
fool
was
nasty
to
the
taste
and
if
persevered
in
disastrous
in
its
effects
general
unpopularity
might
be
needed
to
teach
miss
poppit
not
to
trespass
on
grandmamma
mapp
preserves
isabel
poppit
lived
with
a
flashy
and
condescending
mother
just
round
the
corner
beyond
the
gardener
cottage
and
opposite
the
west
end
of
the
church
they
were
comparatively
new
inhabitants
of
tilling
having
settled
here
only
two
or
three
years
ago
and
tilling
had
not
yet
quite
ceased
to
regard
them
as
rather
suspicious
characters
suspicion
smouldered
though
it
blazed
no
longer
they
were
certainly
rich
and
miss
mapp
suspected
them
of
being
profiteers
they
kept
a
butler
of
whom
they
were
both
in
considerable
awe
who
used
almost
to
shrug
his
shoulders
when
poppit
gave
him
an
order
they
kept
a
to
which
poppit
was
apt
to
allude
more
frequently
than
would
have
been
natural
if
she
had
always
been
accustomed
to
one
and
they
went
to
switzerland
for
a
month
every
winter
and
to
scotland
for
the
as
poppit
terribly
remarked
every
summer
this
all
looked
very
black
and
though
isabel
conformed
to
the
manners
of
tilling
in
doing
household
shopping
every
morning
with
her
wicker
basket
and
buying
damaged
fruit
for
fool
and
in
dressing
in
the
original
manner
indicated
by
good
breeding
and
narrow
incomes
miss
mapp
was
sadly
afraid
that
these
habits
were
not
the
outcome
of
chaste
and
instinctive
simplicity
but
of
the
ambition
to
be
received
by
the
old
families
of
tilling
as
one
of
them
but
what
did
a
true
tillingite
want
with
a
butler
and
a
and
if
these
were
not
sufficient
to
cast
grave
doubts
on
the
sincerity
of
the
inhabitants
of
ye
smalle
house
there
was
still
very
vivid
in
miss
mapp
mind
that
dreadful
moment
undimmed
by
the
years
that
had
passed
over
it
when
poppit
broke
the
silence
at
an
altogether
too
sumptuous
lunch
by
asking
plaistow
if
she
did
not
find
the
a
grievous
burden
on
our
little
incomes
miss
mapp
had
drawn
in
her
breath
sharply
as
if
in
pain
and
after
a
few
gasps
turned
the
conversation
worst
of
all
perhaps
because
more
recent
was
the
fact
that
poppit
had
just
received
the
dignity
of
the
or
member
of
the
order
of
the
british
empire
and
put
it
on
her
cards
too
as
if
to
keep
the
scandal
alive
her
services
in
connection
with
the
tilling
hospital
had
been
entirely
confined
to
putting
her
at
its
disposal
when
she
did
not
want
it
herself
and
not
a
single
member
of
the
tilling
working
club
which
had
knitted
its
fingers
to
the
bone
and
made
enough
bandages
to
reach
to
the
moon
had
been
offered
a
similar
decoration
if
anyone
had
she
would
have
known
what
to
do
a
stinging
letter
to
the
prime
minister
saying
that
she
worked
not
with
hope
of
distinction
but
from
pure
patriotism
would
have
certainly
been
miss
mapp
rejoinder
she
actually
drafted
the
letter
when
name
appeared
and
diligently
waded
through
column
after
column
of
subsequent
lists
to
make
sure
that
she
the
originator
of
the
tilling
working
club
had
not
been
the
victim
of
a
similar
insult
poppit
was
a
climber
that
was
what
she
was
and
miss
mapp
was
obliged
to
confess
that
very
nimble
she
had
been
the
butler
and
the
so
frequently
at
the
disposal
of
poppit
friends
and
the
incessant
lunches
and
teas
had
done
their
work
she
had
fed
rather
than
starved
tilling
into
submission
and
miss
mapp
felt
that
she
alone
upheld
the
dignity
of
the
old
families
she
was
positively
the
only
old
family
and
a
solitary
spinster
at
that
who
had
not
surrendered
to
the
poppits
naturally
she
did
not
carry
her
staunchness
to
the
extent
so
to
speak
of
a
for
that
would
be
singular
conduct
only
worthy
of
suffragettes
and
she
partook
of
the
poppits
hospitality
to
the
fullest
extent
possible
but
here
her
principles
came
in
she
never
returned
the
hospitality
of
the
member
of
the
british
empire
though
she
occasionally
asked
isabel
to
her
house
and
abused
her
soundly
on
all
possible
occasions
this
spiteful
retrospect
passed
swiftly
and
smoothly
through
miss
mind
and
did
not
in
the
least
take
off
from
the
acuteness
with
which
she
observed
the
tide
in
the
affairs
of
tilling
which
after
the
ebb
of
the
night
was
now
flowing
again
nor
did
it
a
few
minutes
after
isabel
disappearance
round
the
corner
prevent
her
from
hearing
the
faint
tinkle
of
the
telephone
in
her
own
house
at
that
she
started
to
her
feet
but
paused
again
at
the
door
she
had
shrewd
suspicions
about
her
servants
with
regard
to
the
telephone
she
was
convinced
though
at
present
she
had
not
been
able
to
get
any
evidence
on
the
point
that
both
her
cook
and
her
parlourmaid
used
it
for
their
own
base
purposes
at
her
expense
and
that
their
friends
habitually
employed
it
for
conversation
with
them
and
perhaps
who
knows
her
housemaid
was
the
worst
of
the
lot
for
she
affected
an
almost
incredible
stupidity
with
regard
to
the
instrument
and
pretended
not
to
be
able
either
to
speak
through
it
or
to
understand
its
cacklings
all
that
might
very
well
be
assumed
in
order
to
divert
suspicion
so
miss
mapp
paused
by
the
door
to
let
any
of
these
delinquents
get
deep
in
conversation
with
her
friend
a
soft
and
stealthy
advance
towards
the
room
called
the
a
small
apartment
opening
out
of
the
hall
and
used
chiefly
for
the
bestowal
of
hats
and
cloaks
and
umbrellas
would
then
enable
her
to
catch
one
of
them
or
at
any
rate
to
overhear
fragments
of
conversation
which
would
supply
equally
direct
evidence
she
had
got
no
further
than
the
into
her
house
when
withers
her
parlourmaid
came
out
miss
mapp
thereupon
began
to
smile
and
hum
a
tune
then
the
smile
widened
and
the
tune
stopped
yes
withers
she
said
were
you
looking
for
me
yes
miss
said
withers
miss
poppit
has
just
rung
you
up
miss
mapp
looked
much
surprised
and
to
think
that
the
telephone
should
have
rung
without
my
hearing
it
she
said
i
must
be
growing
deaf
withers
in
my
old
age
what
does
miss
poppit
want
she
hopes
you
will
be
able
to
go
to
tea
this
afternoon
and
play
bridge
she
expects
that
a
few
friends
may
look
in
at
a
quarter
to
four
a
flood
of
lurid
light
poured
into
miss
mapp
mind
to
expect
that
a
few
friends
may
look
in
was
the
orthodox
way
of
announcing
a
regular
party
to
which
she
had
not
been
asked
and
miss
mapp
knew
as
if
by
a
special
revelation
that
if
she
went
she
would
find
that
she
made
the
eighth
to
complete
two
tables
of
bridge
when
the
butler
opened
the
door
he
would
undoubtedly
have
in
his
hand
a
half
sheet
of
paper
on
which
were
written
the
names
of
the
expected
friends
and
if
the
caller
name
was
not
on
that
list
he
would
tell
her
with
brazen
impudence
that
neither
poppit
nor
miss
poppit
were
at
home
while
before
the
baffled
visitor
had
turned
her
back
he
would
admit
another
caller
who
duly
appeared
on
his
reference
paper
so
then
the
poppits
were
giving
a
to
which
she
had
only
been
bidden
at
the
last
moment
clearly
to
take
the
place
of
some
expected
friend
who
had
developed
influenza
lost
an
aunt
or
been
obliged
to
go
to
london
here
too
was
the
explanation
of
why
as
she
had
overheard
yesterday
major
flint
and
captain
puffin
were
only
intending
to
play
one
round
of
golf
and
to
come
back
by
the
train
and
why
seek
any
further
for
the
explanation
of
the
lump
of
ice
and
the
red
currants
probably
damaged
which
she
had
observed
isabel
purchase
and
anyone
could
see
at
least
miss
mapp
could
why
she
had
gone
to
the
stationer
in
the
high
street
just
before
packs
of
cards
who
the
expected
friend
was
who
had
disappointed
poppit
could
be
thought
out
later
at
present
as
miss
mapp
smiled
at
withers
and
hummed
her
tune
again
she
had
to
settle
whether
she
was
going
to
be
delighted
to
accept
or
obliged
to
decline
the
argument
in
favour
of
being
obliged
to
decline
was
obvious
poppit
deserved
to
be
served
out
for
not
including
her
among
the
original
guests
and
if
she
declined
it
was
quite
probable
that
at
this
late
hour
her
hostess
might
not
be
able
to
get
anyone
else
and
so
one
of
her
tables
would
be
completely
spoiled
in
favour
of
accepting
was
the
fact
that
she
would
get
a
rubber
of
bridge
and
a
good
tea
and
would
be
able
to
say
something
disagreeable
about
the
fool
which
would
serve
miss
poppit
out
for
attempting
to
crib
her
ancestral
dishes
a
bright
a
joyous
a
diabolical
idea
struck
her
and
she
went
herself
to
the
telephone
and
genteelly
wiped
the
place
where
withers
had
probably
breathed
on
it
so
kind
of
you
isabel
she
said
but
i
am
very
busy
and
you
did
give
me
much
notice
did
you
so
i
try
to
look
in
if
i
can
shall
i
i
might
be
able
to
squeeze
it
in
there
was
a
pause
and
miss
mapp
knew
that
she
had
put
isabel
in
a
hole
if
she
successfully
tried
to
get
somebody
else
miss
mapp
might
find
she
could
squeeze
it
in
and
there
would
be
nine
if
she
failed
to
get
someone
else
and
miss
mapp
could
squeeze
it
in
then
there
would
be
seven
isabel
would
have
a
tranquil
moment
all
day
ah
do
squeeze
it
in
she
said
in
those
horrid
wheedling
tones
which
for
some
reason
major
flint
found
so
attractive
that
was
one
of
the
weak
points
about
him
and
there
were
many
many
others
but
that
was
among
those
which
miss
mapp
found
it
difficult
to
condone
if
i
possibly
can
said
miss
mapp
but
at
this
late
hour
dear
or
only
we
hope
she
heard
isabel
polite
laugh
at
this
nearly
new
and
delicious
malaprop
before
she
rang
off
isabel
collected
malaprops
and
wrote
them
out
in
a
note
book
if
you
reversed
the
and
began
at
the
other
end
you
would
find
the
collection
of
spoonerisms
which
were
very
amusing
too
tea
followed
by
a
was
in
summer
the
chief
manifestation
of
the
spirit
of
hospitality
in
tilling
poppit
it
is
true
had
attempted
to
do
something
in
the
way
of
but
though
she
was
at
liberty
to
give
as
many
as
she
pleased
nobody
else
had
followed
her
ostentatious
example
entailed
a
higher
scale
of
living
miss
mapp
for
one
had
accurately
counted
the
cost
of
having
three
hungry
people
to
dinner
and
found
that
one
such
was
not
nearly
compensated
for
in
the
way
of
expense
by
being
invited
to
three
subsequent
by
your
guests
voluptuous
teas
were
the
rule
after
which
you
really
wanted
no
more
than
little
bits
of
things
a
cup
of
soup
a
slice
of
cold
tart
or
a
piece
of
fish
and
some
toasted
cheese
then
after
the
excitement
of
bridge
and
bridge
was
very
exciting
in
tilling
a
puzzle
or
patience
cooled
your
brain
and
composed
your
nerves
in
winter
however
with
its
scarcity
of
daylight
tilling
commonly
gave
evening
and
asked
the
requisite
number
of
friends
to
drop
in
after
dinner
though
everybody
knew
that
everybody
else
had
only
partaken
of
bits
of
things
probably
the
ruinous
price
of
coal
had
something
to
do
with
these
evening
for
the
fire
that
warmed
your
room
when
you
were
alone
would
warm
all
your
guests
as
well
and
then
when
your
hospitality
was
returned
you
could
let
your
fire
go
out
but
though
miss
mapp
was
already
planning
something
in
connection
with
winter
bridge
winter
was
a
long
way
off
yet
before
miss
mapp
got
back
to
her
window
in
the
great
offensive
which
she
always
alluded
to
as
the
royce
had
come
round
the
corner
and
stopping
opposite
major
flint
house
was
entirely
extinguishing
all
survey
of
the
street
beyond
it
was
clear
enough
then
that
she
had
sent
the
royce
to
take
the
two
out
to
the
so
that
they
should
have
time
to
play
their
round
and
catch
the
back
to
tilling
again
so
as
to
be
in
good
time
for
the
even
as
she
looked
major
flint
came
out
of
his
house
on
one
side
of
the
royce
and
captain
puffin
on
the
other
the
royce
obstructed
their
view
of
each
other
and
simultaneously
each
of
them
shouted
across
to
the
house
of
the
other
captain
puffin
emitted
a
loud
major
an
australian
ejaculation
learned
on
his
voyages
while
major
flint
bellowed
captain
which
all
the
world
knew
was
of
oriental
origin
the
noise
each
of
them
made
prevented
him
from
hearing
the
other
and
presently
one
in
a
fuming
hurry
to
start
ran
round
in
front
of
the
car
at
the
precise
moment
that
the
other
ran
round
behind
it
and
they
both
banged
loudly
on
each
other
knockers
these
knocks
were
not
so
precisely
simultaneous
as
the
shouts
had
been
and
this
led
to
mutual
discovery
hailed
with
peals
of
falsetto
laughter
on
the
part
of
captain
puffin
and
the
more
manly
guffaws
of
the
major
after
that
the
royce
lumbered
down
the
cobbles
of
the
street
and
after
a
great
deal
of
reversing
managed
to
turn
the
corner
miss
mapp
set
off
with
her
basket
to
do
her
shopping
she
carried
in
it
the
weekly
books
which
she
would
leave
with
payment
but
not
without
argument
at
the
tradesmen
shops
there
was
an
item
for
suet
which
she
intended
to
resist
to
the
last
breath
in
her
body
though
her
butcher
would
probably
surrender
long
before
that
there
was
an
item
for
eggs
at
the
dairy
which
she
might
have
to
pay
though
it
was
a
monstrous
overcharge
she
had
made
up
her
mind
about
the
laundry
she
intended
to
pay
that
bill
with
an
icy
countenance
and
say
good
morning
for
ever
or
words
to
that
effect
unless
the
proprietor
instantly
produced
the
the
article
of
clothing
which
had
been
lost
in
the
wash
like
king
john
treasures
or
refunded
an
ample
sum
for
the
replacing
of
it
all
these
quarrelsome
errands
were
meat
and
drink
to
miss
mapp
tuesday
morning
the
day
on
which
she
paid
and
disputed
her
weekly
bills
was
as
enjoyable
as
sunday
mornings
when
sitting
close
under
the
pulpit
she
noted
the
glaring
inconsistencies
and
grammatical
errors
in
the
discourse
after
the
bills
were
paid
and
business
was
done
there
was
pleasure
to
follow
for
there
was
a
at
the
the
of
a
to
be
worn
at
which
unless
miss
mapp
was
sadly
mistaken
would
astound
and
agonize
by
its
magnificence
all
who
set
eyes
on
it
she
had
found
the
description
of
it
as
worn
by
titus
trout
in
an
american
fashion
paper
it
was
of
what
was
described
as
kingfisher
blue
and
had
lumps
and
wedges
of
lace
round
the
edge
of
the
skirt
and
orange
chiffon
round
the
neck
as
she
set
off
with
her
basket
full
of
tradesmen
books
she
pictured
to
herself
with
watering
mouth
the
fury
the
jealousy
the
madness
of
envy
which
it
would
raise
in
all
breasts
in
spite
of
her
malignant
curiosity
and
her
cancerous
suspicions
about
all
her
friends
in
spite
too
of
her
restless
activities
miss
mapp
was
not
as
might
have
been
expected
a
lady
of
lean
and
emaciated
appearance
she
was
tall
and
portly
with
plump
hands
a
broad
benignant
face
and
dimpled
cheeks
an
acute
observer
might
have
detected
a
danger
warning
in
the
sidelong
glances
of
her
rather
bulgy
eyes
and
in
a
certain
tightness
at
the
corners
of
her
expansive
mouth
which
boded
ill
for
any
who
came
within
snapping
distance
but
to
a
more
superficial
view
she
was
a
rollicking
figure
of
a
woman
her
mode
of
address
too
bore
out
this
misleading
impression
nothing
for
instance
could
have
been
more
genial
just
now
than
her
telephone
voice
to
isabel
poppit
or
her
smile
to
withers
even
while
she
so
strongly
suspected
her
of
using
the
telephone
for
her
own
base
purposes
and
as
she
passed
along
the
high
street
she
showered
little
smiles
and
bows
on
acquaintances
and
friends
she
markedly
drew
back
her
lips
in
speaking
being
in
no
way
ashamed
of
her
long
white
teeth
and
wore
a
practically
perpetual
smile
when
there
was
the
least
chance
of
being
under
observation
though
at
sermon
time
on
sunday
as
has
been
already
remarked
she
greedily
noted
the
weaknesses
and
errors
of
which
those
twenty
minutes
was
so
rewardingly
full
she
sat
all
the
time
with
eyes
and
a
pretty
sacred
smile
on
her
lips
and
now
when
she
spied
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
the
figure
of
the
vicar
she
tripped
slantingly
across
the
road
to
him
as
if
by
the
move
of
a
knight
at
chess
looking
everywhere
else
and
only
perceiving
him
with
glad
surprise
at
the
very
last
moment
he
was
a
great
frequenter
of
tea
parties
and
except
in
lent
an
assiduous
player
of
bridge
for
a
clergyman
duties
so
he
very
properly
held
were
not
confined
to
visiting
the
poor
and
exhorting
the
sinner
he
should
be
a
man
of
the
world
and
enter
into
the
pleasures
of
his
prosperous
parishioners
as
well
as
into
the
trials
of
the
troubled
being
an
accomplished
he
entered
not
only
into
their
pleasures
but
their
pockets
and
there
was
no
lady
of
tilling
who
was
not
pleased
to
have
bartlett
for
a
partner
his
winnings
so
he
said
he
gave
annually
to
charitable
objects
though
whether
the
charities
he
selected
began
at
home
was
a
point
on
which
miss
mapp
had
quite
made
up
her
mind
not
a
penny
of
that
will
the
poor
ever
see
was
the
gist
of
her
reflections
when
on
disastrous
days
she
paid
him
she
always
called
him
padre
and
had
never
actually
caught
him
looking
over
his
adversaries
hands
good
morning
padre
she
said
as
soon
as
she
perceived
him
what
a
lovely
day
the
white
butterflies
were
enjoying
themselves
so
in
the
sunshine
in
my
garden
and
the
swallows
miss
mapp
as
every
reader
will
have
perceived
wanted
to
know
whether
he
was
playing
bridge
this
afternoon
at
the
poppits
major
flint
and
captain
puffin
certainly
were
and
it
might
be
taken
for
granted
that
godiva
plaistow
was
with
the
poppits
and
herself
that
made
six
bartlett
was
humorously
archaic
in
speech
he
interlarded
archaisms
with
highland
expressions
and
his
face
was
knobby
like
a
chest
of
drawers
ha
good
morrow
fair
dame
he
said
and
prithee
art
not
thou
even
as
ye
white
butterflies
oh
bartlett
said
the
fair
dame
with
a
provocative
glance
naughty
comparing
me
to
a
delicious
butterfly
nay
prithee
why
naughty
said
he
yea
indeed
it
a
day
to
make
ye
little
fowles
rejoice
ha
i
perceive
you
are
on
the
errands
of
the
guid
wife
martha
and
he
pointed
to
the
basket
yes
tuesday
morning
said
miss
mapp
i
pay
all
my
household
books
on
tuesday
poor
but
honest
dear
padre
what
a
rush
life
is
i
hardly
know
which
way
to
turn
little
duties
in
all
directions
and
you
you
always
busy
such
a
busy
bee
busy
b
busy
bartlett
quo
she
yes
i
a
busy
b
mistress
mapp
sermon
all
morning
choir
practice
at
three
a
baptism
at
six
no
time
for
a
walk
let
alone
a
bit
turn
at
the
gowf
miss
mapp
saw
her
opening
and
made
a
busy
bee
line
for
it
oh
but
you
should
get
regular
exercise
padre
said
she
you
take
no
care
of
yourself
after
the
choir
practice
now
and
before
the
baptism
you
could
have
a
brisk
walk
to
please
me
yes
i
had
meant
to
get
a
breath
of
air
then
said
he
but
ye
guid
dame
poppit
has
insisted
that
i
take
a
wee
hand
at
the
cartes
with
them
the
wifey
and
prithee
shall
we
meet
there
that
makes
seven
without
me
thought
miss
mapp
in
parenthesis
aloud
she
said
if
i
can
squeeze
it
in
padre
i
have
promised
dear
isabel
to
do
my
best
well
and
a
lassie
can
do
no
mair
said
he
au
reservoir
then
miss
mapp
was
partly
pleased
partly
annoyed
by
the
agility
with
which
the
padre
brought
out
her
own
particular
joke
it
was
she
who
had
brought
it
down
to
tilling
and
she
felt
she
had
an
option
on
it
at
the
end
of
every
interview
if
she
meant
as
she
had
done
on
this
occasion
to
bring
it
out
on
the
other
hand
it
was
gratifying
to
see
how
popular
it
had
become
she
had
heard
it
last
month
when
on
a
visit
to
a
friend
at
that
sweet
and
refined
village
called
riseholme
it
was
rather
looked
down
on
there
as
not
being
sufficiently
intellectual
but
within
a
week
of
miss
mapp
return
tilling
rang
with
it
and
she
let
it
be
understood
that
she
was
the
original
humorist
godiva
plaistow
came
whizzing
along
the
pavement
a
short
stout
breathless
body
who
might
so
thought
miss
mapp
have
acted
up
to
the
full
and
fell
associations
of
her
christian
name
without
exciting
the
smallest
curiosity
on
the
part
of
the
lewd
miss
mapp
had
much
the
same
sort
of
figure
but
her
height
so
she
was
perfectly
satisfied
to
imagine
converted
corpulence
into
majesty
the
swift
alternation
of
those
feet
gave
the
impression
that
plaistow
was
going
at
a
prodigious
speed
but
they
could
stop
revolving
without
any
warning
and
then
she
stood
still
just
when
a
collision
with
miss
mapp
seemed
imminent
she
came
to
a
dead
halt
it
was
as
well
to
be
quite
certain
that
she
was
going
to
the
poppits
and
miss
mapp
forgave
and
forgot
about
the
worsted
until
she
had
found
out
she
could
never
quite
manage
the
indelicacy
of
saying
godiva
whatever
plaistow
figure
and
age
might
happen
to
be
but
always
addressed
her
as
diva
very
affectionately
whenever
they
were
on
speaking
terms
what
a
lovely
morning
diva
darling
she
said
and
noticing
that
bartlett
was
well
out
of
earshot
the
white
butterflies
were
enjoying
themselves
so
in
the
sunshine
in
my
garden
and
the
swallows
godiva
was
telegraphic
in
speech
lucky
birds
she
said
no
teeth
beaks
miss
mapp
remembered
her
disappearance
round
the
dentist
corner
half
an
hour
ago
and
her
own
firm
inference
on
the
problem
toothache
darling
she
said
so
sorry
wisdom
said
godiva
out
at
one
gas
ready
for
bridge
this
afternoon
playing
poppits
if
i
can
squeeze
it
in
dear
said
miss
mapp
such
a
hustle
diva
put
her
hand
to
her
face
as
wisdom
gave
her
an
awful
twinge
of
course
she
did
not
believe
in
the
hustle
but
her
pangs
prevented
her
from
caring
much
meet
you
then
she
said
shall
be
all
comfortable
then
au
this
was
more
than
could
be
borne
and
miss
mapp
hastily
interrupted
au
reservoir
diva
dear
she
said
with
extreme
acerbity
and
feet
began
swiftly
revolving
again
the
problem
about
the
thus
seemed
to
be
solved
the
two
poppits
the
two
bartletts
the
major
and
the
captain
with
diva
darling
and
herself
made
eight
and
miss
mapp
with
a
sudden
recrudescence
of
indignation
against
isabel
with
regard
to
the
fool
and
the
belated
invitation
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
not
be
able
to
squeeze
it
in
thus
leaving
the
party
one
short
even
apart
from
the
fool
it
served
the
poppits
right
for
not
asking
her
originally
but
only
when
as
seemed
now
perfectly
clear
somebody
else
had
disappointed
them
but
just
as
she
emerged
from
the
butcher
shop
having
gained
a
complete
victory
in
the
matter
of
that
suet
without
expending
the
last
breath
in
her
body
or
anything
like
it
the
whole
of
the
seemingly
solid
structure
came
toppling
to
the
ground
for
on
emerging
flushed
with
triumph
leaving
the
baffled
butcher
to
try
his
tricks
on
somebody
else
if
he
chose
but
not
on
miss
mapp
she
ran
straight
into
the
disgrace
of
tilling
and
her
sex
the
suffragette
artist
who
painted
from
the
nude
both
male
and
female
the
socialist
and
the
germanophil
all
incarnate
in
one
frame
in
spite
of
these
execrable
antecedents
it
was
quite
in
vain
that
miss
mapp
had
tried
to
poison
the
collective
mind
of
tilling
against
this
creature
if
she
hated
anybody
and
she
undoubtedly
did
she
hated
irene
coles
the
bitterest
part
of
it
all
was
that
if
miss
coles
was
amused
at
anybody
and
she
undoubtedly
was
she
was
amused
at
miss
mapp
miss
coles
was
strolling
along
in
the
attire
to
which
tilling
generally
had
got
accustomed
but
miss
mapp
never
she
had
an
old
hat
jammed
down
on
her
head
a
tall
collar
and
stock
a
large
loose
coat
knickerbockers
and
grey
stockings
in
her
mouth
was
a
cigarette
in
her
hand
she
swung
the
orthodox
she
had
certainly
been
to
the
other
fishmonger
at
the
end
of
the
high
street
for
a
lobster
revived
perhaps
after
a
sojourn
on
the
ice
by
this
warm
sun
which
the
butterflies
and
the
swallows
had
been
rejoicing
in
was
climbing
with
claws
and
waving
legs
over
the
edge
of
it
irene
removed
her
cigarette
from
her
mouth
and
did
something
in
the
gutter
which
is
usually
associated
with
the
floor
of
smoking
carriages
then
her
handsome
boyish
face
more
boyish
because
her
hair
was
closely
clipped
broke
into
a
broad
grin
hullo
mapp
she
said
been
giving
the
tradesmen
what
for
on
tuesday
morning
miss
mapp
found
it
extremely
difficult
to
bear
this
obviously
insolent
form
of
address
without
a
spasm
of
rage
irene
called
her
mapp
because
she
chose
to
and
mapp
more
bitterness
felt
it
wiser
not
to
provoke
coles
she
had
a
dreadful
humorous
tongue
an
indecent
disregard
of
public
or
private
opinion
and
her
gift
of
mimicry
was
as
appalling
as
her
opinion
about
the
germans
sometimes
miss
mapp
alluded
to
her
as
quaint
irene
but
that
was
as
far
as
she
got
in
the
way
of
reprisals
oh
you
sweet
thing
she
said
treasure
irene
in
some
ghastly
way
seemed
to
take
note
of
this
why
men
like
captain
puffin
and
major
flint
found
irene
fetching
and
killing
was
more
than
miss
mapp
could
understand
or
wanted
to
understand
quaint
irene
looked
down
at
her
basket
why
there
my
lunch
going
over
the
top
like
those
beastly
british
tommies
she
said
get
back
love
miss
mapp
could
not
quite
determine
whether
love
was
a
sarcastic
echo
of
treasure
it
seemed
probable
oh
what
a
dear
little
lobster
she
said
look
at
his
sweet
claws
i
shall
do
more
than
look
at
them
soon
said
irene
poking
it
into
her
basket
again
come
and
have
tiffin
i
got
to
look
after
myself
what
has
happened
to
your
devoted
lucy
asked
miss
mapp
irene
lived
in
a
very
queer
way
with
one
gigantic
maid
who
but
for
her
sex
might
have
been
in
the
guards
ill
i
suspect
said
irene
very
infectious
is
it
i
was
up
nursing
her
all
last
night
miss
mapp
recoiled
she
did
not
share
major
flint
robust
views
about
microbes
but
i
hope
dear
you
thoroughly
disinfected
oh
yes
soap
and
water
said
irene
by
the
way
are
you
poppiting
this
afternoon
if
i
can
squeeze
it
in
said
miss
mapp
we
meet
again
then
oh
au
reservoir
said
miss
mapp
instantly
no
not
that
silly
old
chestnut
said
irene
i
was
going
to
say
that
i
was
only
going
to
say
do
come
to
tiffin
you
and
me
and
the
lobster
then
you
and
me
but
it
a
bore
about
lucy
i
was
painting
her
fine
figure
gorgeous
legs
you
would
like
to
sit
for
me
till
she
well
again
miss
mapp
gave
a
little
squeal
and
bolted
into
her
dressmaker
she
always
felt
battered
after
a
conversation
with
irene
and
needed
kingfisher
blue
to
restore
her
chapter
ii
there
is
not
in
all
england
a
town
so
blatantly
picturesque
as
tilling
nor
one
for
the
lover
of
level
marsh
land
of
tall
reedy
dykes
of
enormous
sunsets
and
rims
of
blue
sea
on
the
horizon
with
so
fortunate
an
environment
the
hill
on
which
it
is
built
rises
steeply
from
the
level
land
and
crowned
by
the
great
grave
church
so
conveniently
close
to
miss
mapp
residence
positively
consists
of
quaint
corners
and
timber
cottages
and
mellow
georgian
fronts
corners
and
quaintnesses
gems
glimpses
and
bits
are
an
obsession
to
the
artist
and
in
consequence
during
the
summer
months
not
only
did
the
majority
of
its
inhabitants
turn
out
into
the
cobbled
ways
with
canvases
and
paintboxes
but
every
morning
brought
into
the
town
charabancs
from
neighbouring
places
loaded
with
passengers
many
of
whom
joined
the
artistic
residents
and
you
would
have
thought
until
an
inspection
of
their
productions
convinced
you
of
the
contrary
that
some
tremendous
outburst
of
art
was
rivalling
the
italian
renaissance
for
those
who
were
capable
of
tackling
straight
lines
and
the
intricacies
of
perspective
there
were
the
steep
cobbled
streets
of
charming
and
irregular
architecture
while
for
those
who
rightly
felt
themselves
colourists
rather
than
architectural
draughtsmen
there
was
the
view
from
the
top
of
the
hill
over
the
marshes
there
but
for
one
straight
line
to
mark
the
horizon
and
that
could
easily
be
misty
there
were
no
petty
conventionalities
in
the
way
of
perspective
and
the
eager
practitioner
could
almost
instantly
plunge
into
vivid
greens
and
celestial
blues
or
at
sunset
into
pinks
and
chromes
and
tourists
who
had
no
pictorial
gifts
would
pick
their
way
among
the
sketchers
and
search
the
shops
for
cracked
china
and
bits
of
brass
few
if
any
of
them
left
without
purchasing
one
of
the
famous
tilling
made
in
the
shape
of
a
pottery
pig
who
bore
on
his
back
that
remarkable
legend
of
his
authenticity
which
ran
i
wo
be
druv
though
i
am
willing
good
morning
my
love
said
the
pig
of
tilling
miss
mapp
had
a
long
shelf
full
of
these
in
every
colour
to
adorn
her
the
one
which
completed
her
collection
of
a
pleasant
magenta
colour
had
only
just
been
acquired
she
called
them
my
sweet
rainbow
of
piggies
and
often
when
she
came
down
to
breakfast
especially
if
withers
was
in
the
room
she
said
good
morning
quaint
little
piggies
when
withers
had
left
the
room
she
counted
them
the
corner
where
the
street
took
a
turn
towards
the
church
just
below
the
window
of
her
was
easily
the
most
popular
stance
for
sketchers
you
were
bewildered
and
bowled
over
by
bits
for
the
most
accomplished
of
all
there
was
that
rarely
attempted
feat
the
view
of
the
steep
downward
street
which
in
spite
of
all
the
efforts
of
the
artist
insisted
in
the
sketch
on
going
up
hill
instead
then
next
in
difficulty
was
the
street
after
it
had
turned
running
by
the
gardener
cottage
up
to
the
churchyard
and
the
church
this
in
spite
of
its
difficulty
was
a
very
favourite
subject
for
it
included
on
the
right
of
the
street
just
beyond
miss
mapp
garden
wall
the
famous
crooked
chimney
which
was
continually
copied
from
every
point
of
view
the
expert
artist
would
draw
it
rather
more
crooked
than
it
really
was
in
order
that
there
might
be
no
question
that
he
had
not
drawn
it
crooked
by
accident
this
sketch
was
usually
negotiated
from
the
three
steps
in
front
of
miss
mapp
front
door
opposite
the
would
sit
others
drawing
the
front
door
itself
difficult
and
moistening
their
pencils
at
their
cherry
lips
while
a
little
further
down
the
street
was
another
battalion
hard
at
work
at
the
gabled
front
of
the
and
its
picturesque
bow
it
was
a
favourite
occupation
of
miss
mapp
when
there
was
a
decent
gathering
of
artists
outside
to
pull
a
table
right
into
the
window
of
the
in
full
view
of
them
and
quite
unconscious
of
their
presence
to
arrange
flowers
there
with
a
smiling
and
pensive
countenance
she
had
other
little
playful
public
pastimes
she
would
get
her
kitten
from
the
house
and
induce
it
to
sit
on
the
table
while
she
diverted
it
with
the
tassel
of
the
blind
and
she
would
kiss
it
on
its
sweet
little
sooty
head
or
she
would
write
letters
in
the
window
or
play
patience
there
and
then
suddenly
become
aware
that
there
was
no
end
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
looking
at
her
sometimes
she
would
come
out
of
the
house
if
the
steps
were
very
full
with
her
own
sketching
paraphernalia
in
her
hands
and
say
ever
so
coyly
may
i
scriggle
through
or
ask
the
squatters
on
her
own
steps
if
they
could
find
a
little
corner
for
her
that
was
so
interesting
for
them
they
would
remember
afterwards
that
just
while
they
were
engaged
on
their
sketches
the
lady
of
that
beautiful
house
at
the
corner
who
had
been
playing
with
her
kitten
in
the
window
came
out
to
sketch
too
she
addressed
gracious
and
yet
humble
remarks
to
them
i
see
you
are
painting
my
sweet
little
home
may
i
look
oh
what
a
lovely
little
sketch
once
on
a
day
she
observed
one
of
them
take
a
camera
from
his
pocket
and
rapidly
focus
her
as
she
stood
on
the
top
step
she
turned
and
smiling
to
the
camera
just
in
time
to
catch
the
click
of
the
shutter
but
then
it
was
too
late
to
hide
her
face
and
perhaps
the
picture
might
appear
in
the
or
the
or
among
the
posturing
nymphs
of
a
neighbouring
this
afternoon
she
was
content
to
scriggle
through
the
sketchers
and
humming
a
little
tune
she
passed
up
to
the
churchyard
scriggle
was
one
of
her
own
words
highly
popular
it
connoted
squeezing
and
wriggling
there
she
carefully
concealed
herself
under
the
boughs
of
the
weeping
ash
tree
directly
opposite
the
famous
south
porch
of
the
church
she
had
already
drawn
in
the
lines
of
this
south
porch
on
her
transferring
them
there
by
means
of
a
tracing
from
a
photograph
so
that
formed
a
very
promising
beginning
to
her
sketch
but
she
was
nicely
placed
not
only
with
regard
to
her
sketch
for
by
peeping
through
the
pretty
foliage
of
the
tree
she
could
command
the
front
door
of
poppit
house
miss
mapp
plans
for
the
had
of
course
been
completely
upset
by
the
encounter
with
irene
in
the
high
street
up
till
that
moment
she
had
imagined
that
with
the
two
ladies
of
the
house
and
the
bartletts
and
the
major
and
the
captain
and
godiva
and
herself
two
complete
tables
of
bridge
would
be
formed
and
she
had
therefore
determined
that
she
would
not
be
able
to
squeeze
the
party
into
her
numerous
engagements
thereby
spoiling
the
second
table
but
now
everything
was
changed
there
were
eight
without
her
and
unless
at
a
quarter
to
four
she
saw
reason
to
suppose
by
noting
the
arrivals
at
the
house
that
three
bridge
tables
were
in
contemplation
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
squeeze
it
in
so
that
there
would
be
nine
gamblers
and
isabel
or
her
mother
if
they
had
any
sense
of
hospitality
to
their
guests
would
be
compelled
to
sit
out
for
ever
and
ever
miss
mapp
had
been
urgently
invited
sweet
isabel
had
made
a
great
point
of
her
squeezing
it
in
and
if
sweet
isabel
in
order
to
be
certain
of
a
company
of
eight
had
asked
quaint
irene
as
well
it
would
serve
her
right
an
additional
reason
besides
this
piece
of
in
managing
to
squeeze
it
in
for
the
sake
of
sweet
isabel
lay
in
the
fact
that
she
would
be
able
to
take
some
fool
and
after
one
spoonful
exclaim
delicious
and
leave
the
rest
uneaten
the
white
butterflies
and
the
swallows
were
still
enjoying
themselves
in
the
sunshine
and
so
too
were
the
gnats
about
whose
pleasure
especially
when
they
settled
on
her
face
miss
mapp
did
not
care
so
much
but
soon
she
quite
ceased
to
regard
them
for
before
the
quaint
little
gilded
boys
on
each
side
of
the
clock
above
the
north
porch
had
hammered
out
the
after
three
on
their
bells
visitors
began
to
arrive
at
the
poppits
door
and
miss
mapp
was
very
active
looking
through
the
boughs
of
the
weeping
ash
and
sitting
down
again
to
smile
and
ponder
over
her
sketch
with
her
head
a
little
on
one
side
if
anybody
approached
one
by
one
the
expected
guests
presented
themselves
and
were
admitted
major
flint
and
captain
puffin
the
padre
and
his
wife
darling
diva
with
her
head
muffled
in
a
cloud
and
finally
irene
still
dressed
as
she
had
been
in
the
morning
and
probably
reeking
with
with
the
two
poppits
these
made
eight
players
so
as
soon
as
irene
had
gone
in
miss
mapp
hastily
put
her
sketching
things
away
and
holding
her
drawing
with
its
wash
of
sky
not
quite
dry
in
her
hand
hurried
to
the
door
for
it
would
never
do
to
arrive
after
the
two
tables
had
started
since
in
that
case
it
would
be
she
who
would
have
to
sit
out
boon
opened
the
door
to
her
three
staccato
little
knocks
and
sulkily
consulted
his
list
she
duly
appeared
on
it
and
was
admitted
having
banged
the
door
behind
her
he
crushed
the
list
up
in
his
hand
and
threw
it
into
the
fireplace
all
those
whose
presence
was
desired
had
arrived
and
boon
would
turn
his
bovine
eye
on
any
subsequent
caller
and
say
that
his
mistress
was
out
and
may
i
put
my
sketching
things
down
here
please
boon
said
miss
mapp
ingratiatingly
and
will
no
one
touch
my
drawing
it
a
little
wet
still
the
church
porch
boon
made
a
grunting
noise
like
the
tilling
pig
and
slouched
away
in
front
of
her
down
the
passage
leading
to
the
garden
sniffing
there
they
were
with
the
two
set
out
in
a
shady
corner
of
the
lawn
and
a
buffet
vulgarly
heaped
with
all
sorts
of
dainty
confections
which
made
miss
mapp
mouth
water
obliging
her
to
swallow
rapidly
once
or
twice
before
she
could
manage
a
wide
dry
smile
isabel
advanced
dear
said
miss
mapp
such
a
rush
but
managed
to
squeeze
it
in
as
you
would
let
me
off
oh
that
was
nice
of
you
miss
mapp
said
isabel
a
wild
and
awful
surmise
seized
miss
mapp
and
your
dear
mother
she
said
where
is
mrs
poppit
mamma
had
to
go
to
town
this
morning
she
wo
be
back
till
close
on
miss
mapp
smile
closed
up
like
a
furled
umbrella
the
trap
had
snapped
behind
her
it
was
impossible
now
to
scriggle
away
she
had
completed
instead
of
spoiling
the
second
table
so
we
just
eight
said
isabel
poking
at
her
so
to
speak
through
the
wires
shall
we
have
a
rubber
first
and
then
some
tea
or
tea
first
what
says
everybody
restless
and
hungry
murmurs
like
those
heard
at
the
enclosure
in
the
zoological
gardens
when
approaches
seemed
to
indicate
tea
first
and
with
gallant
greetings
from
the
major
and
archaistic
welcomes
from
the
padre
miss
mapp
headed
the
general
drifting
movement
towards
the
buffet
there
may
have
been
tea
there
but
there
was
certainly
iced
coffee
and
lager
beer
and
large
jugs
with
dew
on
the
outside
and
vegetables
floating
in
a
bubbling
liquid
in
the
inside
and
it
was
all
so
vulgar
and
opulent
that
with
one
accord
everyone
set
to
work
in
earnest
in
order
that
the
garden
should
present
a
less
gross
and
greedy
appearance
but
there
was
no
sign
at
present
of
the
fool
which
was
baffling
and
have
you
had
a
good
game
of
golf
major
asked
miss
mapp
making
the
best
of
these
miserable
circumstances
such
a
lovely
day
the
white
butterflies
were
enjoying
she
became
aware
that
diva
and
the
padre
who
had
already
heard
about
the
white
butterflies
were
in
her
immediate
neighbourhood
and
broke
off
which
of
you
beat
or
should
i
say
she
asked
major
flint
long
moustache
was
dripping
with
lager
beer
and
he
made
a
dexterous
sucking
movement
well
the
army
and
the
navy
had
it
out
he
said
and
for
once
britain
navy
was
not
invincible
eh
puffin
captain
puffin
limped
away
pretending
not
to
hear
and
took
his
heaped
plate
and
brimming
glass
in
the
direction
of
irene
but
i
sure
captain
puffin
played
quite
beautifully
too
said
miss
mapp
in
the
vain
attempt
to
detain
him
she
liked
to
collect
all
the
men
round
her
and
then
scold
them
for
not
talking
to
the
other
ladies
well
a
game
a
game
said
the
major
it
gets
through
the
hours
miss
mapp
yes
we
finished
at
the
fourteenth
hole
and
hurried
back
to
more
congenial
society
and
what
have
you
done
i
be
bound
titania
ha
suet
errands
and
errands
about
a
missing
article
of
underclothing
were
really
the
most
important
things
that
miss
mapp
had
done
now
that
her
scheme
had
so
miscarried
but
naturally
she
would
not
allude
to
these
a
little
gardening
she
said
a
little
sketching
a
little
singing
not
time
to
change
my
frock
and
put
on
something
less
shabby
but
i
would
have
kept
sweet
isabel
waiting
for
anything
and
so
i
came
straight
from
my
painting
here
padre
i
been
trying
to
draw
the
lovely
south
porch
but
so
difficult
i
shall
give
up
trying
to
draw
and
just
enjoy
myself
with
looking
and
there
your
dear
evie
how
de
do
evie
love
godiva
plaistow
had
taken
off
her
cloud
for
purposes
of
mastication
but
wound
it
tightly
round
her
head
again
as
soon
as
she
had
eaten
as
much
as
she
could
manage
this
had
to
be
done
on
one
side
of
her
mouth
or
with
the
front
teeth
in
the
nibbling
manner
of
a
rabbit
everybody
of
course
by
now
knew
that
she
had
had
a
wisdom
tooth
out
at
one
with
gas
and
she
could
allude
to
it
without
explanation
dreamed
i
was
playing
bridge
she
said
and
had
a
hand
of
aces
as
i
played
the
first
it
went
off
in
my
hand
all
over
blood
hope
come
true
bar
the
blood
miss
mapp
found
herself
soon
afterwards
partnered
with
major
flint
and
opposed
by
irene
and
the
padre
they
had
hardly
begun
to
consider
their
first
hands
when
boon
staggered
out
into
the
garden
under
the
weight
of
a
large
wooden
bucket
packed
with
ice
that
surrounded
an
interior
cylinder
red
currant
fool
at
last
thought
miss
mapp
adding
aloud
o
poor
little
me
is
it
to
declare
shall
i
say
trumps
must
consult
your
partner
mapp
said
irene
puffing
the
end
of
her
cigarette
out
of
its
holder
irene
was
painfully
literal
i
do
darling
said
miss
mapp
beginning
to
fizz
a
little
no
trumps
not
a
trump
not
any
sort
of
trump
there
what
are
we
playing
for
by
the
way
bob
a
hundred
said
the
padre
forgetting
to
be
either
scotch
or
archaic
oh
gambler
you
want
the
to
be
the
rich
box
padre
said
miss
mapp
surveying
her
magnificent
hand
with
the
greatest
satisfaction
if
it
had
not
contained
so
many
she
would
have
proposed
playing
for
sixpence
not
a
shilling
a
hundred
all
semblance
of
manners
was
invariably
thrown
to
the
winds
by
the
ladies
of
tilling
when
once
bridge
began
primeval
hatred
took
their
place
the
winners
of
any
hand
were
exasperatingly
condescending
to
the
losers
and
the
losers
correspondingly
bitter
and
tremulous
miss
mapp
failed
to
get
her
contract
as
her
partner
contribution
to
success
consisted
of
more
twos
and
threes
than
were
ever
seen
together
before
and
when
quaint
irene
at
the
end
said
bad
luck
mapp
miss
hands
trembled
so
much
with
passion
that
she
with
difficulty
marked
the
score
but
she
could
command
her
voice
sufficiently
to
say
lovely
of
you
to
be
sympathetic
dear
irene
in
answer
gave
a
short
hoarse
laugh
and
dealed
by
this
time
boon
had
deposited
at
the
left
hand
of
each
player
a
cup
containing
a
red
creamy
fluid
on
the
surface
of
which
bubbles
intermittently
appeared
isabel
at
this
moment
being
dummy
had
strolled
across
from
the
other
table
to
see
that
everybody
was
comfortable
and
provided
with
sustenance
in
times
of
stress
and
here
was
clearly
the
proper
opportunity
for
miss
mapp
to
take
a
spoonful
of
this
attempt
at
fool
and
with
a
wry
face
hastily
but
not
too
hastily
smothered
in
smiles
to
push
the
revolting
compound
away
from
her
but
the
one
spoonful
that
she
took
was
so
delicious
and
exhilarating
that
she
was
positively
unable
to
be
good
for
isabel
instead
she
drank
her
cup
to
the
dregs
in
an
absent
manner
while
considering
how
many
trumps
were
out
the
fool
made
a
similarly
agreeable
impression
on
major
flint
my
word
he
said
that
amazingly
good
cooling
on
a
hot
day
like
this
full
of
champagne
miss
mapp
seeing
that
it
was
so
popular
had
of
course
to
claim
it
again
as
a
family
invention
no
dear
major
she
said
there
no
champagne
in
it
it
my
grandmamma
mapp
famous
fool
with
little
additions
perhaps
by
me
no
champagne
yolk
of
egg
and
a
little
cream
dear
isabel
has
got
it
very
nearly
right
the
padre
had
promised
to
take
more
tricks
in
diamonds
than
he
had
the
slightest
chance
of
doing
his
mental
worry
communicated
itself
to
his
voice
and
why
should
there
be
nary
a
wee
drappie
o
champagne
in
it
he
said
though
your
grandmamma
mapp
did
invent
it
weel
let
see
your
hand
partner
eh
that
a
sair
sight
and
there
be
a
sair
wee
score
agin
us
when
ye
through
with
the
playin
o
it
said
irene
in
tones
that
could
not
be
acquitted
of
a
mocking
intent
why
the
hell
hallelujah
did
you
go
on
when
i
support
you
even
that
one
glass
of
fool
though
there
was
no
champagne
in
it
had
produced
together
with
the
certainty
that
her
opponent
had
overbidden
his
hand
a
pleasant
exhilaration
in
miss
mapp
but
yolk
of
egg
as
everybody
knew
was
a
strong
stimulant
suddenly
the
name
fool
seemed
very
amusing
to
her
fool
she
said
what
a
quaint
name
i
shall
invent
some
others
i
shall
tell
my
cook
to
make
some
or
my
play
i
think
a
ducky
little
ace
of
spades
haw
haw
gooseberry
idiot
said
her
partner
capital
you
wo
beat
that
in
a
hurry
and
a
two
of
spades
on
the
top
of
it
you
would
expect
to
find
a
two
of
spades
at
the
bottom
of
it
said
the
padre
with
singular
acidity
the
major
was
quick
to
resent
this
kind
of
comment
from
a
man
cloth
or
no
cloth
well
by
your
leave
bartlett
by
your
leave
i
repeat
he
said
i
shall
expect
to
find
twos
of
spades
precisely
where
i
please
and
when
i
want
your
criticism
miss
mapp
hastily
intervened
and
after
my
wee
ace
a
little
she
said
and
if
my
partner
does
play
the
queen
to
it
delicious
and
i
play
just
one
more
yes
lovely
partner
puts
wee
trumpy
on
it
i
not
surprised
it
takes
more
than
that
to
surprise
me
and
then
padre
got
another
spade
i
ken
fine
hoots
said
the
padre
with
temperate
disgust
the
hand
proceeded
for
a
round
or
two
in
silence
during
which
by
winks
and
gestures
to
boon
the
major
got
hold
of
another
cupful
of
fool
there
was
already
a
heavy
penalty
of
tricks
against
miss
mapp
opponents
and
after
a
moment
refreshment
the
major
led
a
club
of
which
at
this
period
miss
mapp
seemed
to
have
none
she
felt
happier
than
she
had
been
ever
since
trying
to
spoil
isabel
second
table
she
had
only
succeeded
in
completing
it
little
trumpy
again
she
said
putting
it
on
with
the
lightness
of
one
of
the
white
butterflies
and
turning
the
trick
useful
little
trumpy
she
broke
off
suddenly
from
the
chant
of
victory
which
ladies
of
tilling
were
accustomed
to
indulge
in
during
for
she
discovered
in
her
hand
another
more
than
useless
little
clubby
the
silence
that
succeeded
became
tense
in
quality
miss
mapp
knew
she
had
revoked
and
squeezed
her
brains
to
think
how
she
could
possibly
dispose
of
the
card
while
there
was
a
certain
calmness
about
the
padre
which
but
too
clearly
indicated
that
he
was
quite
content
to
wait
for
the
inevitable
disclosure
this
came
at
the
last
trick
and
though
miss
mapp
made
one
forlorn
attempt
to
thrust
the
horrible
little
clubby
underneath
the
other
cards
and
gather
them
up
the
padre
pounced
on
it
what
ho
fair
lady
he
said
now
completely
restored
methinks
thou
art
forsworn
let
me
have
a
keek
at
the
last
trick
but
three
verily
i
wis
that
thou
didst
trump
ye
club
aforetime
i
said
so
there
it
is
eh
that
bonny
for
us
partner
miss
mapp
of
course
denied
it
all
and
a
ruthless
reconstruction
of
the
tricks
took
place
the
major
still
busy
with
fool
was
the
last
to
grasp
the
disaster
and
then
instantly
deplored
the
unsportsmanlike
greed
of
his
adversaries
well
i
should
have
thought
in
a
friendly
game
like
this
he
said
of
course
you
within
your
right
bartlett
might
is
right
hey
but
upon
my
word
a
pound
of
flesh
you
know
ca
think
what
made
you
do
it
partner
you
never
asked
me
if
i
had
any
more
clubs
said
miss
mapp
shrilly
giving
up
for
the
moment
the
contention
that
she
had
not
revoked
i
always
ask
if
my
partner
has
no
more
of
a
suit
and
i
always
maintain
that
a
revoke
is
more
the
partner
fault
than
the
player
of
course
if
our
adversaries
claim
it
naturally
we
do
mapp
said
irene
you
were
down
on
me
sharp
enough
the
other
day
miss
mapp
wrinkled
her
face
up
into
the
sweetest
and
extremest
smile
of
which
her
mobile
features
were
capable
darling
you
wo
mind
my
telling
you
that
just
at
this
moment
you
are
being
dummy
she
said
and
so
you
must
speak
a
single
word
otherwise
there
is
no
revoke
even
if
there
was
at
all
which
i
consider
far
from
proved
yet
there
was
no
further
proof
possible
beyond
the
clear
and
final
evidence
of
the
cards
and
since
everybody
including
miss
mapp
herself
was
perfectly
well
aware
that
she
had
revoked
their
opponents
merely
marked
up
the
penalty
and
the
game
proceeded
miss
mapp
of
course
following
the
rule
of
correct
behaviour
after
revoking
stiffened
into
a
state
of
offended
dignity
and
was
extremely
polite
and
distant
with
partner
and
adversaries
alike
this
demeanour
became
even
more
majestic
when
in
the
next
hand
the
major
led
out
of
turn
the
moment
he
had
done
it
miss
mapp
hurriedly
threw
a
random
card
out
of
her
hand
on
to
the
table
in
the
hope
that
irene
by
some
strange
aberration
would
think
she
had
led
first
wait
a
second
said
she
i
call
a
lead
give
me
a
trump
please
suddenly
the
awful
expression
as
of
some
outraged
empress
faded
from
miss
mapp
face
and
she
gave
a
little
shriek
of
laughter
which
sounded
like
a
squeaking
slate
pencil
have
got
one
dear
she
said
now
may
i
have
your
permission
to
lead
what
i
think
best
thank
you
there
now
existed
between
the
four
players
that
state
of
violent
animosity
which
was
the
usual
atmosphere
towards
the
end
of
a
rubber
but
it
would
have
been
a
capital
mistake
to
suppose
that
they
were
not
all
enjoying
themselves
immensely
emotion
is
the
salt
of
life
and
here
was
no
end
of
salt
everyone
was
overbidding
his
hand
and
the
penalty
tricks
were
a
glorious
cause
of
vituperation
scarcely
veiled
between
the
partners
who
had
failed
to
make
good
and
caused
epidemics
of
condescending
sympathy
from
the
adversaries
which
produced
a
passion
in
the
losers
far
keener
than
their
fury
at
having
lost
what
made
the
concluding
stages
of
this
contest
the
more
exciting
was
that
an
evening
breeze
suddenly
arising
just
as
a
deal
was
ended
made
the
cards
rise
in
the
air
like
a
covey
of
partridges
they
were
recaptured
and
all
the
hands
were
found
to
be
complete
with
the
exception
of
miss
mapp
which
had
a
card
missing
this
an
ace
of
hearts
was
discovered
by
the
padre
face
upwards
in
a
bed
of
mignonette
and
he
was
vehement
in
claiming
a
fresh
deal
on
the
grounds
that
the
card
was
exposed
miss
mapp
could
not
speak
at
all
in
answer
to
this
preposterous
claim
she
could
only
smile
at
him
and
proceed
to
declare
trumps
as
if
nothing
had
happened
the
major
alone
failed
to
come
up
to
the
full
measure
of
these
enjoyments
for
though
all
the
rest
of
them
were
as
angry
with
him
as
they
were
with
each
other
he
remained
in
a
most
indecorous
state
of
drinking
thirstily
of
the
fool
and
when
he
was
dummy
quite
failing
to
mind
whether
miss
mapp
got
her
contract
or
not
captain
puffin
at
the
other
table
seemed
to
be
behaving
with
the
same
impropriety
for
the
sound
of
his
shrill
falsetto
laugh
was
as
regular
as
his
visits
to
the
bucket
of
fool
what
if
there
was
champagne
in
it
after
all
so
miss
mapp
luridly
conjectured
what
if
this
unseemly
was
due
to
incipient
intoxication
she
took
a
little
more
of
that
delicious
decoction
herself
it
was
unanimously
determined
when
the
two
rubbers
came
to
an
end
almost
simultaneously
that
as
everything
was
so
pleasant
and
agreeable
there
should
be
no
fresh
sorting
of
the
players
besides
the
second
table
was
only
playing
stakes
of
sixpence
a
hundred
and
it
would
be
very
awkward
and
unsettling
that
anyone
should
play
these
moderate
points
in
one
rubber
and
those
high
ones
the
next
but
at
this
point
miss
mapp
table
was
obliged
to
endure
a
pause
for
the
padre
had
to
hurry
away
just
before
six
to
administer
the
rite
of
baptism
in
the
church
which
was
so
conveniently
close
the
major
afforded
a
good
deal
of
amusement
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
hearing
by
hoping
that
he
would
not
baptize
the
child
the
knave
of
hearts
if
it
was
a
boy
or
if
a
girl
the
queen
of
spades
but
in
order
to
spare
the
susceptibilities
of
bartlett
this
admirable
joke
was
not
communicated
to
the
next
table
but
enjoyed
privately
the
author
of
it
however
made
a
note
in
his
mind
to
tell
it
to
captain
puffin
in
the
hopes
that
it
would
cause
him
to
forget
his
ruinous
defeat
at
golf
this
morning
quite
as
agreeable
was
the
arrival
of
a
fresh
supply
of
fool
and
as
this
had
been
heralded
a
few
minutes
before
by
a
loud
pop
from
the
butler
pantry
which
looked
on
to
the
lawn
miss
mapp
began
to
waver
in
her
belief
that
there
was
no
champagne
in
it
particularly
as
it
would
not
have
suited
the
theory
by
which
she
accounted
for
the
unwonted
and
her
suggestion
that
the
pop
they
had
all
heard
so
clearly
was
the
opening
of
a
bottle
of
stone
was
not
delivered
with
conviction
to
make
sure
however
she
took
one
more
sip
of
the
new
supply
and
irradiated
with
smiles
made
a
great
concession
i
believe
i
was
wrong
she
said
there
is
something
in
it
beyond
yolk
of
egg
and
cream
oh
there
boon
he
will
tell
us
she
made
a
seductive
face
at
boon
and
beckoned
to
him
boon
will
you
think
it
very
inquisitive
of
me
she
asked
archly
if
i
ask
you
whether
you
have
put
a
teeny
drop
of
champagne
into
this
delicious
fool
a
bottle
and
a
half
miss
said
boon
morosely
and
half
a
pint
of
old
brandy
will
you
have
some
more
miss
miss
mapp
curbed
her
indignation
at
this
vulgar
squandering
of
precious
liquids
so
characteristic
of
poppits
she
gave
a
shrill
little
laugh
oh
no
thank
you
boon
she
said
i
must
have
any
more
delicious
though
major
flint
let
boon
fill
up
his
cup
while
he
was
not
looking
and
we
owe
this
to
your
grandmother
miss
mapp
he
asked
gallantly
that
a
second
debt
miss
mapp
acknowledged
this
polite
subtlety
with
a
reservation
but
not
the
champagne
in
it
major
she
said
grandmamma
nap
the
major
beat
his
thigh
in
ecstasy
ha
that
a
good
spoonerism
for
miss
isabel
book
he
said
miss
isabel
we
got
a
new
miss
mapp
was
very
much
puzzled
at
this
slight
confusion
in
her
speech
for
her
utterance
was
usually
remarkably
distinct
there
might
be
some
little
joke
made
at
her
expense
on
the
effect
of
grandmamma
invention
if
this
lovely
spoonerism
was
published
but
if
she
who
had
only
just
tasted
the
fool
tripped
in
her
speech
how
amply
were
major
flint
good
nature
and
captain
puffin
incessant
laugh
accounted
for
she
herself
felt
very
too
how
pleasant
it
all
was
oh
naughty
she
said
to
the
major
pray
hush
you
disturbing
them
at
their
rubber
and
here
the
padre
back
again
the
new
rubber
had
only
just
begun
indeed
it
was
lucky
that
they
cut
their
cards
without
any
delay
when
poppit
appeared
on
her
return
from
her
expedition
to
london
miss
mapp
begged
her
to
take
her
hand
and
instantly
began
playing
it
would
really
be
a
kindness
to
me
poppit
she
said
no
diamonds
at
all
partner
but
of
course
if
you
wo
you
been
missing
such
a
lovely
party
so
much
enjoyment
suddenly
she
saw
that
poppit
was
wearing
on
her
ample
breast
a
small
piece
of
riband
with
a
little
cross
attached
to
it
her
entire
stock
of
vanished
and
she
smiled
her
widest
we
need
ask
what
took
you
to
london
she
said
congratulations
how
was
the
dear
king
this
rubber
was
soon
over
and
even
as
they
were
adding
up
the
score
there
arose
a
shrill
outcry
from
the
next
table
where
plaistow
as
usual
had
made
the
tale
of
her
winnings
sixpence
in
excess
of
what
anybody
else
considered
was
due
to
her
the
sound
of
that
was
so
familiar
that
nobody
looked
up
or
asked
what
was
going
on
darling
diva
and
her
bawbees
padre
said
miss
mapp
in
an
aside
so
modest
in
her
demands
oh
she
stopped
somebody
has
given
her
sixpence
not
another
rubber
well
perhaps
it
is
rather
late
and
i
must
say
to
my
flowers
before
they
close
up
for
the
night
all
those
shillings
mine
fancy
miss
mapp
was
seething
with
excitement
curiosity
and
rage
as
with
major
flint
on
one
side
of
her
and
captain
puffin
on
the
other
she
was
escorted
home
the
excitement
was
due
to
her
winnings
the
rage
to
poppit
order
the
curiosity
to
the
clue
she
believed
she
had
found
to
those
inexplicable
lights
that
burned
so
late
in
the
houses
of
her
companions
certainly
it
seemed
that
major
flint
was
trying
not
to
step
on
the
joints
of
the
and
succeeding
very
imperfectly
while
captain
puffin
on
her
left
was
walking
very
unevenly
on
the
cobbles
even
making
due
allowance
for
the
difficulty
of
walking
evenly
there
at
any
time
miss
mapp
could
not
help
thinking
that
a
teetotaller
would
have
made
a
better
job
of
it
than
that
both
gentlemen
talked
at
once
very
agreeably
but
rather
carefully
major
flint
promising
himself
a
studious
evening
over
some
very
interesting
entries
in
his
indian
diary
while
captain
puffin
anticipated
the
speedy
solution
of
that
problem
about
the
roman
road
which
had
puzzled
him
so
long
as
they
said
their
au
reservoirs
to
her
on
her
doorstep
they
took
off
their
hats
more
often
than
politeness
really
demanded
once
in
her
house
miss
mapp
postponed
her
to
her
sweet
flowers
and
hurried
with
the
utmost
speed
of
which
she
was
capable
to
her
in
order
to
see
what
her
companions
were
doing
they
were
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
street
and
major
flint
with
gesticulating
forefinger
was
being
very
impressive
over
something
interesting
as
was
miss
mapp
walk
home
and
painful
as
was
the
light
which
it
had
conceivably
thrown
on
the
problem
that
had
baffled
her
for
so
long
she
might
have
been
even
more
acutely
disgusted
had
she
lingered
on
with
the
rest
of
the
in
poppit
garden
so
revolting
was
the
sycophantic
loyalty
of
the
member
of
the
british
empire
she
described
minutely
her
arrival
at
the
palace
her
momentary
nervousness
as
she
entered
the
the
instantaneousness
with
which
that
all
vanished
when
she
came
face
to
face
with
her
sovereign
i
assure
you
he
gave
the
most
gracious
smile
she
said
just
as
if
we
had
known
each
other
all
our
lives
and
i
felt
at
home
at
once
and
he
said
a
few
words
to
me
such
a
beautiful
voice
he
has
dear
isabel
i
wish
you
had
been
there
to
hear
it
and
then
oh
mamma
what
did
he
say
asked
isabel
to
the
great
relief
of
plaistow
and
the
bartletts
for
while
they
were
bursting
with
eagerness
to
know
with
the
utmost
detail
all
that
had
taken
place
the
correct
attitude
in
tilling
was
profound
indifference
to
anybody
of
whatever
degree
who
did
not
live
at
tilling
and
to
anything
that
did
not
happen
there
in
particular
any
manifestation
of
interest
in
kings
or
other
distinguished
people
was
held
to
be
a
very
miserable
failing
so
they
all
pretended
to
look
about
them
and
take
no
notice
of
what
poppit
was
saying
and
you
might
have
heard
a
pin
drop
diva
silently
and
hastily
unwound
her
cloud
from
over
her
ears
risking
catching
cold
in
the
hole
where
her
tooth
had
been
so
terrified
was
she
of
missing
a
single
syllable
well
it
was
very
gratifying
said
poppit
he
whispered
to
some
gentleman
standing
near
him
who
i
think
was
the
lord
chamberlain
and
then
told
me
how
interested
he
had
been
in
the
good
work
of
the
tilling
hospital
and
how
especially
glad
he
was
to
be
able
and
just
then
he
began
to
pin
my
order
on
to
be
able
to
recognize
it
now
i
call
that
wonderful
to
know
all
about
the
tilling
hospital
and
such
neat
quick
fingers
he
has
i
am
sure
it
would
take
me
double
the
time
to
make
a
hold
and
then
he
gave
me
another
smile
and
passed
me
on
so
to
speak
to
the
queen
who
stood
next
him
and
who
had
been
listening
to
all
he
had
said
and
did
she
speak
to
you
too
asked
diva
quite
unable
to
maintain
the
right
indifference
indeed
she
did
she
said
pleased
and
what
she
put
into
those
two
words
i
sure
i
can
never
convey
to
you
i
could
hear
how
sincere
they
were
it
was
no
set
form
of
words
as
if
she
meant
nothing
by
it
she
pleased
she
was
just
as
interested
in
what
i
had
done
for
the
tilling
hospital
as
the
king
was
and
the
crowds
outside
they
lined
the
mall
for
at
least
fifty
yards
i
was
bowing
and
smiling
on
this
side
and
that
till
i
felt
quite
dizzy
and
was
the
prince
of
wales
there
asked
diva
beginning
to
wind
her
head
up
again
she
did
not
care
about
the
crowds
no
he
was
there
said
poppit
determined
to
have
no
embroidery
in
her
story
however
much
other
people
especially
miss
mapp
decorated
remarkable
incidents
till
you
hardly
recognized
them
he
was
there
i
daresay
something
had
unexpectedly
detained
him
though
i
should
wonder
if
before
long
we
all
saw
him
for
i
noticed
in
the
evening
paper
which
i
was
reading
on
the
way
down
here
after
i
had
seen
the
king
that
he
was
going
to
stay
with
lord
ardingly
for
this
very
next
and
what
the
station
for
ardingly
park
if
it
tilling
though
it
quite
a
private
visit
i
feel
convinced
that
the
right
and
proper
thing
for
me
to
do
is
to
be
at
the
station
or
at
any
rate
just
outside
with
my
order
on
i
shall
not
claim
acquaintance
with
him
or
anything
of
that
kind
said
poppit
fingering
her
order
but
after
my
reception
at
the
palace
nothing
can
be
more
likely
than
that
his
majesty
might
mention
quite
casually
of
course
to
the
prince
that
he
had
just
given
a
decoration
to
poppit
of
tilling
and
it
would
make
me
feel
very
awkward
to
think
that
that
had
happened
and
i
was
not
somewhere
about
to
make
my
curtsy
oh
mamma
may
i
stand
by
you
or
behind
you
asked
isabel
completely
dazzled
by
the
splendour
of
this
prospect
and
prancing
about
the
lawn
this
was
quite
awful
it
was
as
bad
as
if
not
worse
than
the
historically
disastrous
remark
about
and
a
general
rigidity
as
of
some
partial
cataleptic
seizure
froze
poppit
guests
rendering
them
like
incomplete
marconi
installations
capable
of
receiving
but
not
of
transmitting
they
received
these
impressions
they
also
continued
mechanically
to
receive
more
chocolates
and
sandwiches
and
such
refreshments
as
remained
on
the
buffet
but
no
one
could
intervene
and
stop
poppit
from
exposing
herself
further
one
reason
for
this
of
course
as
already
indicated
was
that
they
all
longed
for
her
to
expose
herself
as
much
as
she
possibly
could
for
if
there
was
a
quality
and
indeed
there
were
many
on
which
tilling
prided
itself
it
was
on
its
immunity
from
snobbishness
there
were
no
doubt
in
the
great
world
with
which
tilling
concerned
itself
so
little
kings
and
queens
and
dukes
and
members
of
the
order
of
the
british
empire
but
every
tillingite
knew
that
he
or
she
particularly
she
was
just
as
good
as
any
of
them
and
indeed
better
being
more
fortunate
than
they
in
living
in
tilling
and
if
there
was
a
process
in
the
world
which
tilling
detested
it
was
being
patronized
and
there
was
this
woman
telling
them
all
what
she
felt
it
right
and
proper
for
her
as
poppit
of
tilling
to
do
when
the
heir
apparent
should
pass
through
the
town
on
saturday
the
rest
of
them
poppit
implied
might
do
what
they
liked
for
they
did
not
matter
but
she
she
must
put
on
her
order
and
make
her
curtsy
and
isabel
by
her
expressed
desire
to
stand
beside
or
even
behind
her
mother
for
this
degrading
moment
had
showed
of
what
stock
she
came
poppit
had
nothing
more
to
say
on
this
subject
indeed
as
diva
reflected
there
was
really
nothing
more
that
could
be
said
unless
she
suggested
that
they
should
all
bow
and
curtsy
to
her
for
the
future
and
their
hostess
proceeded
as
they
all
took
their
leave
to
hope
that
they
had
enjoyed
the
which
she
had
been
unavoidably
prevented
from
attending
but
my
absence
made
it
possible
to
include
miss
mapp
she
said
i
should
not
have
liked
poor
miss
mapp
to
feel
left
out
i
am
always
glad
to
give
miss
mapp
pleasure
i
hope
she
won
her
rubber
she
does
not
like
losing
will
no
one
have
a
little
more
fool
boon
has
made
it
very
tolerably
a
scotch
recipe
of
my
diva
gave
a
little
cackle
of
laughter
as
she
enfolded
herself
in
her
cloud
again
she
had
heard
miss
mapp
ironical
inquiry
as
to
how
the
dear
king
was
and
had
thought
at
the
time
that
it
was
probably
a
pity
that
miss
mapp
had
said
that
though
abhorrence
of
snobbery
and
immunity
from
any
taint
of
it
was
so
fine
a
characteristic
of
public
social
life
at
tilling
the
expected
passage
of
this
distinguished
visitor
through
the
town
on
saturday
next
became
very
speedily
known
and
before
the
of
the
ladies
in
their
morning
marketings
next
day
were
half
full
there
was
no
quarter
which
the
news
had
failed
to
reach
major
flint
had
it
from
plaistow
as
he
went
down
to
the
tram
out
to
the
and
though
he
had
not
much
time
to
spare
for
his
work
last
night
on
his
old
diaries
had
caused
him
to
breakfast
unusually
late
that
morning
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
dismal
headache
from
he
had
stopped
to
converse
with
miss
mapp
immediately
afterwards
with
one
eye
on
the
time
for
naturally
he
could
not
fire
off
that
sort
of
news
at
her
as
if
it
was
a
matter
of
any
interest
or
importance
good
morning
dear
lady
he
said
by
jove
what
a
picture
of
health
and
freshness
you
are
miss
mapp
cast
one
glance
at
her
basket
to
see
that
the
paper
quite
concealed
that
article
of
clothing
which
the
perfidious
laundry
had
found
probably
the
laundry
knew
where
it
was
all
the
time
and
in
a
figurative
sense
of
course
was
trying
it
on
early
to
bed
and
early
to
rise
major
she
said
i
saw
my
sweet
flowers
open
their
eyes
this
morning
such
a
beautiful
dew
well
my
diaries
kept
me
up
late
last
night
he
said
when
all
you
fascinating
ladies
have
withdrawn
is
the
only
time
at
which
i
can
bring
myself
to
sit
down
to
them
let
me
recommend
six
to
eight
in
the
morning
major
said
miss
mapp
earnestly
such
a
freshness
of
brain
then
that
seemed
to
be
a
in
the
way
of
leading
up
to
the
important
subject
and
the
major
tried
another
turning
good
game
of
bridge
we
had
yesterday
he
said
just
met
plaistow
she
stopped
on
for
a
chat
after
we
had
gone
dear
diva
she
loves
a
good
gossip
said
miss
mapp
effusively
such
an
interest
she
has
in
other
people
affairs
so
human
and
sympathetic
i
sure
our
dear
hostess
told
her
all
about
her
adventures
at
the
palace
there
was
only
seven
minutes
left
before
the
tram
started
and
though
this
was
not
a
perfect
opening
it
would
have
to
do
besides
the
major
saw
plaistow
coming
energetically
along
the
high
street
with
whirling
feet
yes
and
we
have
finished
with
ha
royalty
yet
he
said
getting
the
odious
word
out
with
difficulty
the
prince
of
wales
will
be
passing
through
the
town
on
saturday
on
his
way
to
ardingly
park
where
he
is
spending
the
sunday
miss
mapp
was
not
betrayed
into
the
smallest
expression
of
interest
that
will
be
nice
for
him
she
said
he
will
catch
a
glimpse
of
our
beautiful
tilling
so
he
will
well
i
off
for
my
game
of
golf
perhaps
the
navy
will
be
a
bit
more
efficient
i
sure
you
will
both
play
perfectly
said
miss
mapp
diva
had
popped
into
the
grocer
she
always
popped
everywhere
just
now
she
popped
across
to
see
a
friend
and
she
popped
home
again
she
popped
into
church
on
sunday
and
occasionally
popped
up
to
town
and
miss
mapp
was
beginning
to
feel
that
somebody
ought
to
let
her
know
directly
or
by
insinuation
that
she
popped
too
much
so
thinking
that
an
opportunity
might
present
itself
now
miss
mapp
read
the
outside
the
stationer
till
diva
popped
out
of
the
grocer
again
the
headlines
of
news
even
the
largest
of
them
hardly
reached
her
brain
because
it
entirely
absorbed
in
another
subject
of
course
the
first
thing
was
to
find
out
by
what
train
diva
trundled
swiftly
across
the
street
good
morning
elizabeth
she
said
you
left
the
party
too
early
yesterday
missed
a
lot
how
the
king
smiled
how
the
queen
said
pleased
our
dear
hostess
would
like
that
said
miss
mapp
pensively
she
would
be
so
pleased
too
she
and
the
queen
would
both
be
pleased
quite
a
pair
of
them
by
the
way
on
saturday
next
began
diva
i
know
dear
said
miss
mapp
major
flint
told
me
it
seemed
quite
to
interest
him
now
i
must
pop
into
the
stationer
diva
was
really
very
obtuse
i
popping
in
there
too
she
said
want
a
of
the
trains
wild
horses
would
not
have
dragged
from
miss
mapp
that
this
was
precisely
what
she
wanted
i
only
wanted
a
little
ruled
paper
she
said
why
here
dear
evie
popping
out
just
as
we
pop
in
good
morning
sweet
evie
lovely
day
again
bartlett
thrust
something
into
her
basket
which
very
much
resembled
a
railway
she
spoke
in
a
low
quick
voice
as
if
afraid
of
being
overheard
and
was
otherwise
rather
like
a
mouse
when
she
was
excited
she
squeaked
so
good
for
the
harvest
she
said
such
an
important
thing
to
have
a
good
harvest
i
hope
next
saturday
will
be
fine
it
would
be
a
pity
if
he
had
a
wet
day
we
were
wondering
kenneth
and
i
what
would
be
the
proper
thing
to
do
if
he
came
over
for
service
oh
here
is
kenneth
she
stopped
abruptly
as
if
afraid
that
she
had
betrayed
too
much
interest
in
next
saturday
and
sunday
kenneth
would
manage
it
much
better
ha
lady
fair
he
exclaimed
having
a
bit
crack
with
wee
wifey
any
news
this
bright
morning
no
dear
padre
said
miss
mapp
showing
her
gums
at
least
heard
nothing
of
any
interest
i
can
only
give
you
the
news
of
my
garden
such
lovely
new
roses
in
bloom
bless
them
plaistow
had
popped
into
the
stationer
so
this
perjury
was
undetected
the
padre
was
noted
for
his
diplomacy
just
now
he
wanted
to
convey
the
impression
that
nothing
which
could
happen
next
saturday
or
sunday
could
be
of
the
smallest
interest
to
him
whereas
he
had
spent
an
almost
sleepless
night
in
wondering
whether
it
would
in
certain
circumstances
be
proper
to
make
a
bow
at
the
beginning
of
his
sermon
and
another
at
the
end
whether
he
ought
to
meet
the
visitor
at
the
west
door
whether
the
mayor
ought
to
be
told
and
whether
there
ought
to
be
special
psalms
well
lady
fair
he
said
gossip
will
have
it
that
ye
prince
of
wales
is
staying
at
ardingly
for
the
sunday
indeed
he
will
i
suppose
pass
through
tilling
on
saturday
afternoon
miss
mapp
put
her
forefinger
to
her
forehead
as
if
trying
to
recollect
something
yes
now
somebody
did
tell
me
that
she
said
major
flint
i
believe
but
when
you
asked
for
news
i
thought
you
meant
something
that
really
interested
me
yes
padre
aweel
if
he
comes
to
service
on
sunday
dear
padre
i
sure
he
hear
a
very
good
sermon
oh
i
see
what
you
mean
whether
you
ought
to
have
any
special
hymn
do
ask
poor
little
me
poppit
i
sure
would
tell
you
she
knows
all
about
courts
and
etiquette
diva
popped
out
of
the
stationer
at
this
moment
sold
out
she
announced
everybody
wanted
this
morning
evie
got
the
last
have
to
go
to
the
station
i
walk
with
you
diva
dear
said
miss
mapp
there
a
parcel
that
dear
evie
au
reservoir
she
kissed
her
hand
to
bartlett
leaving
a
smile
behind
it
as
it
fluttered
away
from
her
face
for
the
padre
miss
mapp
was
so
impenetrably
wrapped
in
thought
as
she
worked
among
her
sweet
flowers
that
afternoon
that
she
merely
stared
at
a
which
she
had
absently
rooted
up
instead
of
a
piece
of
groundsel
without
any
bleeding
of
the
heart
for
one
of
her
sweet
flowers
there
were
two
trains
by
which
he
might
arrive
one
at
which
would
get
him
to
ardingly
for
tea
the
other
at
she
was
quite
determined
to
see
him
but
more
inflexible
than
that
resolve
was
the
euclidean
postulate
that
no
one
in
tilling
should
think
that
she
had
taken
any
deliberate
step
to
do
so
for
the
present
she
had
disarmed
suspicion
by
the
blankness
of
her
indifference
as
to
what
might
happen
on
saturday
or
sunday
but
she
herself
strongly
suspected
that
everybody
else
in
spite
of
the
public
attitude
of
tilling
to
such
subjects
was
determined
to
see
him
too
how
to
see
and
not
be
seen
was
the
question
which
engrossed
her
and
though
she
might
possibly
happen
to
be
at
that
sharp
corner
outside
the
station
where
every
motor
had
to
go
slow
on
the
arrival
of
the
it
would
never
do
to
risk
being
seen
there
again
precisely
at
poppit
shameless
in
her
snobbery
would
no
doubt
be
at
the
station
with
her
order
on
at
both
these
hours
if
the
arrival
did
not
take
place
by
the
first
train
and
isabel
would
be
prancing
by
or
behind
her
and
in
fact
dreadful
though
it
was
to
contemplate
all
tilling
she
reluctantly
believed
would
be
hanging
about
then
an
idea
struck
her
so
glorious
that
she
put
the
uprooted
in
the
instead
of
planting
it
again
and
went
quickly
indoors
up
to
the
attics
and
from
there
popped
really
popped
so
tight
was
the
fit
through
a
on
to
the
roof
yes
the
station
was
plainly
visible
and
if
the
was
the
favoured
train
there
would
certainly
be
a
motor
from
ardingly
park
waiting
there
in
good
time
for
its
arrival
from
the
she
could
ascertain
that
and
she
would
then
have
time
to
trip
down
the
hill
and
get
to
her
coal
merchant
at
that
sharp
corner
outside
the
station
and
ask
rather
peremptorily
when
the
coke
for
her
central
heating
might
be
expected
it
was
due
now
and
though
it
would
be
unfortunate
if
it
arrived
before
saturday
it
was
quite
easy
to
smile
away
her
peremptory
manner
and
say
that
withers
had
not
told
her
miss
mapp
hated
prevarication
but
a
major
force
sometimes
came
along
but
if
no
motors
from
ardingly
park
were
in
waiting
for
the
as
spied
from
her
she
need
not
risk
being
seen
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
station
but
would
again
make
observations
some
few
minutes
before
the
was
due
there
was
positively
no
other
train
by
which
he
could
come
the
next
day
or
two
saw
no
traceable
developments
in
the
situation
but
miss
mapp
trained
sense
told
her
that
there
was
underground
work
of
some
kind
going
on
she
seemed
to
hear
faint
hollow
taps
and
muffled
knockings
and
so
to
speak
the
silence
of
some
unusual
pregnancy
up
and
down
the
high
street
she
observed
short
whispered
conversations
going
on
between
her
friends
which
broke
off
on
her
approach
this
only
confirmed
her
view
that
these
secret
colloquies
were
connected
with
saturday
afternoon
for
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
after
her
freezing
reception
of
the
news
any
projected
snobbishness
should
be
confided
to
her
and
though
she
would
have
liked
to
know
what
diva
and
irene
and
darling
evie
were
meaning
to
do
the
fact
that
they
none
of
them
told
her
showed
that
they
were
aware
that
she
at
any
rate
was
utterly
indifferent
to
and
above
that
sort
of
thing
she
suspected
too
that
major
flint
had
fallen
victim
to
this
mania
for
on
friday
afternoon
when
passing
his
door
which
happened
to
be
standing
open
she
quite
distinctly
saw
him
in
front
of
his
glass
in
the
hall
standing
on
the
head
of
one
of
the
tigers
to
secure
a
better
view
of
himself
trying
on
a
silk
her
own
errand
at
this
moment
was
to
the
draper
where
she
bought
a
quantity
of
pretty
pale
blue
braid
for
a
little
domestic
which
was
in
arrears
and
some
riband
of
the
same
tint
at
this
clever
and
unusual
hour
for
shopping
the
high
street
was
naturally
empty
and
after
a
little
hesitation
and
many
anxious
glances
to
right
and
left
she
plunged
into
the
and
bought
a
pleasant
little
union
jack
with
a
short
stick
attached
to
it
she
told
dabnet
very
distinctly
that
it
was
a
present
for
her
nephew
and
concealed
it
inside
her
parasol
where
it
lay
quite
flat
and
made
no
perceptible
bulge
at
four
on
saturday
afternoon
she
remembered
that
the
damp
had
come
in
through
her
bedroom
ceiling
in
a
storm
last
winter
and
told
withers
she
was
going
to
have
a
look
to
see
if
any
tiles
were
loose
in
order
to
ascertain
this
for
certain
she
took
up
through
the
trap
door
a
pair
of
binocular
glasses
through
which
it
was
also
easy
to
identify
anybody
who
might
be
in
the
open
yard
outside
the
station
even
as
she
looked
poppit
and
isabel
crossed
the
yard
into
the
and
it
was
a
little
surprising
that
there
were
not
more
friends
in
the
but
at
the
moment
she
heard
a
loud
in
the
street
below
and
cautiously
peering
over
the
parapet
she
got
an
admirable
view
of
the
major
in
a
and
tall
hat
a
answered
him
and
captain
puffin
in
a
new
suit
miss
mapp
was
certain
of
it
and
a
panama
hat
joined
him
they
went
down
the
street
and
turned
the
corner
across
the
opening
to
the
high
street
there
shot
the
figure
of
darling
diva
while
waiting
for
them
to
appear
again
in
the
miss
mapp
looked
to
see
what
vehicles
were
standing
there
it
was
already
ten
minutes
past
four
and
the
ardingly
motors
must
have
been
there
by
this
time
if
there
was
anything
doing
by
the
but
positively
the
only
vehicle
there
was
an
open
trolly
laden
with
a
piano
in
a
sack
apart
from
knowing
all
about
that
piano
for
poppit
had
talked
about
little
else
than
her
new
upright
bluthner
before
her
visit
to
buckingham
palace
a
moment
reflection
convinced
miss
mapp
that
this
was
a
very
unlikely
mode
of
conveyance
for
any
guest
she
watched
for
a
few
moments
more
but
as
no
other
friends
appeared
in
the
she
concluded
that
they
were
hanging
about
the
street
somewhere
poor
things
and
decided
not
to
make
inquiries
about
her
coke
just
yet
she
had
tea
while
she
arranged
flowers
in
the
very
front
of
the
window
in
her
and
presently
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
many
of
the
baffled
loyalists
trudging
home
there
was
no
need
to
do
more
than
smile
and
tap
the
window
and
kiss
her
hand
they
all
knew
that
she
had
been
busy
with
her
flowers
and
that
she
knew
what
they
had
been
busy
about
out
again
they
all
came
towards
six
and
when
she
had
watched
the
last
of
them
down
the
hill
she
hurried
back
to
the
roof
again
to
make
a
final
inspection
of
the
loose
tiles
through
her
binoculars
brief
but
exciting
was
that
inspection
for
opposite
the
entrance
to
the
station
was
drawn
up
a
motor
so
clear
was
the
air
and
so
serviceable
her
binoculars
that
she
could
distinguish
the
vulgar
coronet
on
the
panels
and
as
she
looked
poppit
and
isabel
hurried
across
the
it
was
then
but
the
work
of
a
moment
to
slip
on
the
trimmed
with
blue
braid
adjust
the
hat
with
the
blue
riband
and
take
up
the
parasol
with
its
furled
union
jack
inside
it
the
stick
of
the
flag
was
uppermost
she
could
whip
it
out
in
a
moment
miss
mapp
had
calculated
her
appearance
to
a
nicety
just
as
she
got
to
the
sharp
corner
opposite
the
station
where
all
cars
slowed
down
and
her
office
was
situated
the
train
drew
up
by
the
gates
into
the
yard
were
standing
the
major
in
his
the
captain
in
his
panama
irene
in
a
civilized
skirt
diva
in
a
walking
dress
and
the
padre
and
wee
wifey
they
were
all
looking
in
the
direction
of
the
station
and
miss
mapp
stepped
into
the
unobserved
oddly
enough
the
coke
had
been
sent
three
days
before
and
there
was
no
need
for
peremptoriness
so
good
of
you
mr
wootten
she
said
and
why
is
everyone
standing
about
this
afternoon
wootten
explained
the
reason
of
this
and
miss
mapp
grasping
her
parasol
went
out
again
as
the
car
left
the
station
there
were
too
many
dear
friends
about
she
decided
to
use
the
union
jack
and
having
seen
what
she
wanted
to
she
determined
to
slip
quietly
away
again
already
the
major
hat
was
in
his
hand
and
he
was
bowing
low
so
too
were
captain
puffin
and
the
padre
while
irene
diva
and
evie
were
making
little
ducking
movements
miss
mapp
was
determined
when
it
came
to
her
turn
to
show
them
as
she
happened
to
be
on
the
spot
what
a
proper
curtsy
was
the
car
came
opposite
her
and
she
curtsied
so
low
that
recovery
was
impossible
and
she
sat
down
in
the
road
her
parasol
flew
out
of
her
hand
and
out
of
her
parasol
flew
the
union
jack
she
saw
a
young
man
looking
out
of
the
window
dressed
in
khaki
grinning
broadly
but
not
so
she
thought
graciously
and
it
suddenly
struck
her
that
there
was
something
beside
her
own
part
in
the
affair
which
was
not
as
it
should
be
as
he
put
his
head
in
again
there
was
loud
laughter
from
the
inside
of
the
car
wootten
helped
her
up
and
the
entire
assembly
of
her
friends
crowded
round
her
hoping
she
was
not
hurt
no
dear
major
dear
padre
not
at
all
thanks
she
said
so
stupid
my
ancle
turned
oh
yes
the
union
jack
i
bought
for
my
nephew
his
birthday
thank
you
i
just
came
to
see
about
my
coke
of
course
i
thought
the
prince
had
arrived
when
you
all
went
down
to
meet
the
fancy
my
running
straight
into
it
all
how
well
he
looked
this
was
all
rather
lame
and
miss
mapp
hailed
poppit
appearance
from
the
station
as
a
welcome
diversion
poppit
was
looking
vexed
i
hope
you
saw
him
well
poppit
said
miss
mapp
after
meeting
two
trains
and
taking
all
that
trouble
saw
who
said
poppit
with
a
deplorable
lack
both
of
manner
and
grammar
why
light
seemed
to
break
on
her
odious
countenance
why
you
do
think
that
was
the
prince
do
you
miss
mapp
he
arrived
here
at
one
so
the
has
just
told
me
and
has
been
playing
golf
all
afternoon
the
major
looked
at
the
captain
and
the
captain
at
the
major
it
was
months
and
months
since
they
had
missed
their
saturday
afternoon
golf
it
was
the
prince
of
wales
who
looked
out
of
that
said
miss
mapp
firmly
such
a
pleasant
smile
i
should
know
it
anywhere
the
young
man
who
got
into
the
car
at
the
station
was
no
more
the
prince
of
wales
than
you
are
said
poppit
shrilly
i
was
close
to
him
as
he
came
out
i
curtsied
to
him
before
i
saw
miss
mapp
instantly
changed
her
attack
she
could
hardly
hold
her
smile
on
to
her
face
for
rage
how
very
awkward
for
you
she
said
what
a
laugh
they
will
all
have
over
it
this
evening
delicious
poppit
face
suddenly
took
on
an
expression
of
the
tenderest
solicitude
i
hope
miss
mapp
you
did
jar
yourself
when
you
sat
down
in
the
road
just
now
she
said
not
at
all
thank
you
so
much
said
miss
mapp
hearing
her
heart
beat
in
her
throat
if
she
had
had
a
naval
gun
handy
and
had
known
how
to
fire
it
she
would
with
a
sense
of
duty
accomplished
have
discharged
it
at
the
order
of
the
member
of
the
british
empire
and
at
anybody
else
who
might
be
within
range
sunday
of
course
with
all
the
opportunities
of
that
day
still
remained
and
the
seats
of
the
auxiliary
choir
which
were
advantageously
situated
had
never
been
so
full
but
as
it
was
all
no
use
the
major
and
captain
puffin
left
during
the
sermon
to
catch
the
tram
out
to
the
links
on
this
delightful
day
it
was
but
natural
that
the
pleasant
walk
there
across
the
marsh
was
very
popular
and
golfers
that
afternoon
had
a
very
trying
and
nervous
time
for
the
ladies
of
tilling
kept
bobbing
up
from
behind
and
bunkers
as
regardless
of
the
players
they
executed
swift
flank
marches
in
all
directions
miss
mapp
returned
exhausted
about
to
hear
from
withers
that
the
prince
had
spent
an
hour
or
more
rambling
about
the
town
and
had
stopped
quite
five
minutes
at
the
corner
by
the
he
had
actually
sat
down
on
miss
mapp
steps
and
smoked
a
cigarette
she
wondered
if
the
end
of
the
cigarette
was
there
still
it
was
hateful
to
have
defiling
the
steps
to
her
and
often
before
now
when
sketchers
were
numerous
she
had
sent
her
housemaid
out
to
remove
these
untidy
relics
she
searched
for
it
but
was
obliged
to
come
to
the
reluctant
conclusion
that
there
was
nothing
to
remove
chapter
iii
diva
was
sitting
at
the
open
window
of
her
house
in
the
high
street
cutting
with
a
pair
of
sharp
nail
scissors
into
the
old
chintz
curtains
which
her
maid
had
told
her
no
longer
paid
for
the
mending
so
since
they
refused
to
pay
for
their
mending
any
more
she
was
preparing
to
make
them
pay
pretty
smartly
too
in
other
ways
the
pattern
was
of
little
bunches
of
pink
roses
peeping
out
through
trellis
work
and
it
was
these
which
she
had
just
begun
to
cut
out
though
tilling
was
noted
for
the
ingenuity
with
which
its
more
fashionable
ladies
devised
novel
and
quaint
effects
in
their
dress
in
an
economical
manner
diva
felt
sure
ransack
her
memory
though
she
might
that
nobody
had
thought
of
before
the
hot
weather
had
continued
late
into
september
and
showed
no
signs
of
breaking
yet
and
it
would
be
agreeable
to
her
and
acutely
painful
to
others
that
just
at
the
end
of
the
summer
she
should
appear
in
a
perfectly
new
costume
before
the
days
of
jumpers
and
heavy
skirts
and
large
woollen
scarves
came
in
she
was
preparing
therefore
to
take
the
light
white
jacket
which
she
wore
over
her
blouse
and
cover
the
broad
collar
and
cuffs
of
it
with
these
pretty
roses
the
belt
of
the
skirt
would
be
similarly
decorated
and
so
would
the
edge
of
it
if
there
were
enough
clean
ones
the
jacket
and
skirt
had
already
gone
to
the
dyer
and
would
be
back
in
a
day
or
two
white
no
longer
but
of
a
rich
purple
hue
and
by
that
time
she
would
have
hundreds
of
these
little
pink
roses
ready
to
be
tacked
on
perhaps
a
piece
of
the
chintz
trellis
and
all
could
be
sewn
over
the
belt
but
she
was
determined
to
have
single
little
bunches
of
roses
peppered
all
over
the
collar
and
cuffs
of
the
jacket
and
if
possible
round
the
edge
of
the
skirt
she
had
already
tried
the
effect
and
was
of
the
opinion
that
nobody
could
possibly
guess
what
the
origin
of
these
roses
was
when
carefully
sewn
on
they
looked
as
if
they
were
a
design
in
the
stuff
she
let
the
circumcised
roses
fall
on
to
the
and
from
time
to
time
when
they
grew
numerous
swept
them
into
a
cardboard
box
though
she
worked
with
zealous
diligence
she
had
an
eye
to
the
movements
in
the
street
outside
for
it
was
and
there
were
many
observations
to
be
made
she
had
not
anything
like
miss
genius
for
conjecture
but
her
memory
was
appallingly
good
and
this
was
the
third
morning
running
on
which
elizabeth
had
gone
into
the
grocer
it
was
odd
to
go
to
your
grocer
every
day
like
that
groceries
twice
a
week
was
sufficient
for
most
people
from
here
on
the
floor
above
the
street
she
could
easily
look
into
elizabeth
basket
and
she
certainly
was
carrying
nothing
away
with
her
from
the
grocer
for
the
only
thing
there
was
a
small
bottle
done
up
in
white
paper
with
sealing
wax
which
diva
had
no
need
to
be
told
certainly
came
from
the
chemist
and
was
no
doubt
connected
with
too
many
plums
miss
mapp
crossed
the
street
to
the
pavement
below
diva
house
and
precisely
as
she
reached
it
diva
maid
opened
the
door
into
the
bringing
in
the
second
post
or
rather
not
bringing
in
the
second
post
but
the
announcement
that
there
was
any
second
post
this
opening
of
the
door
caused
a
draught
and
the
bunches
of
roses
which
littered
the
rose
brightly
in
the
air
diva
managed
to
beat
most
of
them
down
again
but
two
fluttered
out
of
the
window
precisely
then
and
at
no
other
time
miss
mapp
looked
up
and
one
settled
on
her
face
the
other
fell
into
her
basket
her
trained
faculties
were
all
on
the
alert
and
she
thrust
them
both
inside
her
glove
for
future
consideration
without
stopping
to
examine
them
just
then
she
only
knew
that
they
were
little
pink
roses
and
that
they
had
fluttered
out
of
diva
window
she
paused
on
the
pavement
and
remembered
that
diva
had
not
yet
expressed
regret
about
the
worsted
and
that
she
still
popped
as
much
as
ever
thus
diva
deserved
a
punishment
of
some
sort
and
happily
at
that
very
moment
she
thought
of
a
subject
on
which
she
might
be
able
to
make
her
uncomfortable
the
street
was
full
and
it
would
be
pretty
to
call
up
to
her
instead
of
ringing
her
bell
in
order
to
save
trouble
to
poor
overworked
janet
diva
only
kept
two
servants
though
of
course
poverty
was
no
crime
diva
darling
she
cooed
diva
head
looked
out
like
a
cuckoo
in
a
clock
preparing
to
chime
the
hour
hullo
she
said
want
me
may
i
pop
up
for
a
moment
dear
said
miss
mapp
that
to
say
if
you
not
very
busy
pop
away
said
diva
she
was
quite
aware
that
miss
mapp
said
pop
in
crude
inverted
commas
so
to
speak
for
purposes
of
mockery
and
so
she
said
it
herself
more
than
ever
i
tell
my
maid
to
pop
down
and
open
the
door
while
this
was
being
done
diva
bundled
her
chintz
curtains
together
and
stored
them
and
the
roses
she
had
cut
out
into
her
for
secrecy
was
an
essential
to
the
construction
of
these
decorations
but
in
order
to
appear
naturally
employed
she
pulled
out
the
woollen
scarf
she
was
knitting
for
the
autumn
and
winter
forgetting
for
the
moment
that
the
stripe
at
the
end
on
which
she
was
now
engaged
was
made
of
that
fatal
worsted
which
miss
mapp
considered
to
have
been
feloniously
appropriated
that
was
the
sort
of
thing
miss
mapp
never
forgot
even
among
her
sweet
flowers
her
eye
fell
on
it
the
moment
she
entered
the
room
and
she
tucked
the
two
chintz
roses
more
securely
into
her
glove
i
thought
i
would
just
pop
across
from
the
grocer
she
said
what
a
pretty
scarf
dear
that
a
lovely
shade
of
where
can
i
have
seen
something
like
it
before
this
was
clearly
ironical
and
had
best
be
answered
by
irony
diva
was
no
coward
could
say
i
sure
she
said
miss
mapp
appeared
to
recollect
and
smiled
as
far
back
as
her
diva
could
do
that
i
have
it
she
said
it
was
the
wool
i
ordered
at
heynes
and
then
he
sold
it
you
and
i
could
get
any
more
so
it
was
said
diva
upset
you
a
bit
there
was
the
wool
in
the
shop
i
bought
it
yes
dear
i
see
you
did
but
that
was
what
i
popped
in
about
this
you
know
got
a
cellar
full
said
diva
diva
you
not
been
hoarding
have
you
asked
miss
mapp
with
great
anxiety
they
can
take
away
every
atom
of
coal
you
got
if
so
and
fine
you
i
do
know
what
for
every
hundredweight
of
it
pooh
said
diva
rather
forcing
the
indifference
of
this
rude
interjection
yes
love
pooh
by
all
means
if
you
like
poohing
said
miss
mapp
but
i
should
have
felt
very
unfriendly
if
one
morning
i
found
you
were
fined
found
you
were
fined
quite
a
play
upon
words
and
i
warned
you
diva
felt
a
little
less
poohish
but
how
much
do
they
allow
you
to
have
she
asked
oh
quite
a
little
enough
to
go
on
with
but
i
daresay
they
discover
you
i
just
took
the
trouble
to
come
and
warn
you
diva
did
remember
something
about
hoarding
there
had
surely
been
dreadful
exposures
of
prudent
housekeepers
in
the
papers
which
were
very
uncomfortable
reading
but
all
these
orders
were
only
for
the
period
of
the
war
she
said
no
doubt
you
right
dear
said
miss
mapp
brightly
i
sure
i
hope
you
are
only
if
the
coal
strike
comes
on
i
think
you
find
that
the
regulations
against
hoarding
are
quite
as
severe
as
they
ever
were
food
hoarding
too
twemlow
such
a
civil
man
tells
me
that
he
thinks
we
shall
have
plenty
of
food
or
anyhow
sufficient
for
everybody
for
quite
a
long
time
provided
that
there
no
hoarding
not
been
hoarding
food
too
dear
diva
you
naughty
thing
i
believe
that
great
cupboard
is
full
of
sardines
and
biscuits
and
bovril
nothing
of
the
kind
said
diva
indignantly
you
shall
see
for
yourself
and
then
she
suddenly
remembered
that
the
cupboard
was
full
of
chintz
curtains
and
little
bunches
of
pink
roses
neatly
cut
out
of
them
and
a
pair
of
nail
scissors
there
was
a
perfectly
perceptible
pause
during
which
miss
mapp
noticed
that
there
were
no
curtains
over
the
window
there
certainly
used
to
be
and
they
matched
with
the
chintz
cover
of
the
window
seat
which
was
decorated
with
little
bunches
of
pink
roses
peeping
through
trellis
this
was
in
the
nature
of
a
bonus
she
had
not
up
till
then
connected
the
chintz
curtains
with
the
little
things
that
had
fluttered
down
upon
her
and
were
now
safe
in
her
glove
her
only
real
object
in
this
call
had
been
to
instil
a
general
uneasiness
into
diva
mind
about
the
coal
strike
and
the
danger
of
being
well
provided
with
fuel
that
she
humbly
hoped
that
she
had
accomplished
she
got
up
must
be
going
she
said
such
a
lovely
little
chat
but
what
has
happened
to
your
pretty
curtains
gone
to
the
wash
said
diva
firmly
liar
thought
miss
mapp
as
she
tripped
downstairs
diva
would
have
sent
the
cover
of
the
too
if
that
was
the
case
liar
she
thought
again
as
she
kissed
her
hand
to
diva
who
was
looking
gloomily
out
of
the
window
as
soon
as
miss
mapp
had
gained
her
she
examined
the
mysterious
treasures
in
her
glove
without
the
smallest
doubt
diva
had
taken
down
her
curtains
and
high
time
too
for
they
were
sadly
shabby
and
was
cutting
the
roses
out
of
them
but
what
on
earth
was
she
doing
that
for
for
what
garish
purpose
could
she
want
to
use
bunches
of
roses
cut
out
of
chintz
curtains
miss
mapp
had
put
the
two
specimens
of
which
she
had
providentially
become
possessed
in
her
lap
and
they
looked
very
pretty
against
the
of
her
skirt
diva
was
very
ingenious
she
used
up
all
sorts
of
odds
and
ends
in
a
way
that
did
credit
to
her
undoubtedly
parsimonious
qualities
she
could
trim
a
hat
with
a
and
a
banana
in
such
a
way
that
it
looked
quite
parisian
till
you
firmly
analysed
its
component
parts
and
most
of
her
ingenuity
was
devoted
to
dress
the
more
was
the
pity
that
she
had
such
a
roundabout
figure
that
her
waistband
always
reminded
you
of
the
equator
eureka
said
miss
mapp
aloud
and
though
the
telephone
bell
was
ringing
and
the
postulant
might
be
one
of
the
servants
friends
ringing
them
up
at
an
hour
when
their
mistress
was
usually
in
the
high
street
she
glided
swiftly
to
the
large
cupboard
underneath
the
stairs
which
was
full
of
the
things
which
no
person
could
bear
to
throw
away
broken
pieces
of
brown
paper
cardboard
boxes
without
lids
and
cardboard
lids
without
boxes
old
bags
with
holes
in
them
keys
without
locks
and
locks
without
keys
and
worn
chintz
covers
there
was
one
it
had
once
adorned
the
sofa
in
the
covered
with
red
poppies
very
easy
to
cut
out
and
miss
mapp
dragged
it
dustily
from
its
corner
setting
in
motion
a
perfect
cascade
of
cardboard
lids
and
some
withers
had
answered
the
telephone
and
came
to
announce
that
twemlow
the
grocer
regretted
he
had
only
two
large
tins
of
corned
beef
but
then
say
i
will
have
the
tongue
as
well
withers
said
miss
mapp
just
a
tongue
and
then
i
shall
want
you
and
mary
to
do
some
cutting
out
for
me
the
three
went
to
work
with
feverish
energy
for
diva
had
got
a
start
and
by
four
that
afternoon
there
were
enough
poppies
cut
out
to
furnish
when
in
seed
a
whole
street
of
opium
dens
the
dress
selected
for
decoration
was
apart
from
a
few
the
colour
of
ripe
corn
which
was
superbly
appropriate
for
september
poppies
in
the
corn
said
miss
mapp
over
and
over
to
herself
remembering
some
sweet
verses
she
had
once
read
by
bernard
shaw
or
clement
shorter
or
somebody
like
that
about
a
garden
of
sleep
somewhere
in
norfolk
no
one
can
work
as
neatly
as
you
withers
she
said
gaily
and
i
shall
ask
you
to
do
the
most
difficult
part
i
want
you
to
sew
my
lovely
poppies
over
the
collar
and
facings
of
the
jacket
just
spacing
them
a
little
and
making
a
dainty
irregularity
and
then
mary
wo
you
mary
will
do
the
same
with
the
waistband
while
i
put
a
border
of
them
round
the
skirt
and
my
dear
old
dress
will
look
quite
new
and
lovely
i
shall
be
at
home
to
nobody
withers
this
afternoon
even
if
the
prince
of
wales
came
and
sat
on
my
doorstep
again
we
all
work
together
in
the
garden
shall
we
and
you
and
mary
must
scold
me
if
you
think
not
working
hard
enough
it
will
be
delicious
in
the
garden
thanks
to
this
pleasant
plan
there
was
not
much
opportunity
for
withers
and
mary
to
be
idle
just
about
the
time
that
this
harmonious
party
began
their
work
a
far
from
harmonious
couple
were
being
just
as
industrious
in
the
grand
spacious
bunker
in
front
of
the
tee
to
the
last
hole
on
the
golf
links
it
was
a
beautiful
bunker
consisting
of
a
great
slope
of
loose
steep
sand
against
the
face
of
the
hill
and
solidly
shored
up
with
timber
the
navy
had
been
in
better
form
and
after
a
decisive
victory
over
the
army
in
the
morning
and
an
indemnity
of
its
match
in
the
afternoon
with
just
the
last
hole
to
play
was
all
square
so
captain
puffin
having
the
honour
hit
a
low
nervous
drive
that
tapped
loudly
at
the
timbered
wall
of
the
bunker
and
cuddled
down
below
it
well
protected
from
any
future
assault
phew
that
about
settles
it
said
major
flint
boisterously
bad
place
to
top
a
ball
give
me
the
hole
this
insolent
question
needed
no
answer
and
major
flint
drove
skying
the
ball
to
a
prodigious
height
but
it
had
to
come
to
earth
sometime
and
it
fell
like
lucifer
son
of
the
morning
in
the
middle
of
the
same
bunker
so
the
army
played
three
more
and
sweating
profusely
got
out
then
it
was
the
navy
turn
and
the
navy
had
to
lie
on
its
keel
above
the
boards
of
the
bunker
in
order
to
reach
its
ball
at
all
and
missed
it
twice
better
give
it
up
old
chap
said
major
flint
unplayable
then
see
me
play
it
said
captain
puffin
with
a
chewing
motion
of
his
jaws
we
shall
miss
the
tram
said
the
major
and
with
the
intention
of
giving
annoyance
he
sat
down
in
the
bunker
with
his
back
to
captain
puffin
and
lit
a
cigarette
at
his
third
attempt
nothing
happened
at
the
fourth
the
ball
flew
against
the
boards
rebounded
briskly
again
into
the
bunker
trickled
down
the
steep
sandy
slope
and
hit
the
major
boot
hit
you
i
think
said
captain
puffin
ha
so
it
my
hole
major
major
flint
had
a
short
fit
of
aphasia
he
opened
and
shut
his
mouth
and
foamed
then
he
took
a
from
his
pocket
give
that
to
the
captain
he
said
to
his
caddie
and
without
looking
round
walked
away
in
the
direction
of
the
tram
he
had
not
gone
a
hundred
yards
when
the
whistle
sounded
and
it
puffed
away
homewards
with
velocity
weak
and
trembling
from
passion
major
flint
found
that
after
a
few
tottering
steps
in
the
direction
of
tilling
he
would
be
totally
unable
to
get
there
unless
fortified
by
some
strong
stimulant
and
turned
back
to
the
to
obtain
it
he
always
went
when
beaten
at
golf
while
captain
puffin
was
lame
in
any
circumstances
and
the
two
no
longer
on
speaking
terms
hobbled
into
the
one
after
the
other
each
unconscious
of
the
other
presence
summoning
his
last
remaining
strength
major
flint
roared
for
whisky
and
was
told
that
according
to
regulation
he
could
not
be
served
until
six
there
was
lemonade
and
stone
you
might
as
well
have
offered
a
tiger
bread
and
milk
even
the
threat
that
he
would
instantly
resign
his
membership
unless
provided
with
drink
produced
no
effect
on
a
polite
steward
and
he
sat
down
to
recover
as
best
he
might
with
an
old
volume
of
this
seemed
to
do
him
little
good
his
forced
abstemiousness
was
rendered
the
more
intolerable
by
the
fact
that
captain
puffin
hobbling
in
immediately
afterwards
fetched
from
his
locker
a
large
flask
full
of
the
required
elixir
and
proceeded
to
mix
himself
a
long
strong
tumblerful
after
the
major
rudeness
in
the
matter
of
the
it
was
impossible
for
any
sailor
of
spirit
to
take
the
first
step
towards
reconciliation
thirst
is
a
great
leveller
by
the
time
the
refreshed
puffin
had
penetrated
down
his
glass
the
major
found
it
impossible
to
be
proud
and
proper
any
longer
he
hated
saying
he
was
sorry
no
man
more
and
would
have
been
sorry
if
he
had
been
able
to
get
a
drink
he
twirled
his
moustache
a
great
many
times
and
cleared
his
throat
it
wanted
more
than
that
to
clear
it
and
capitulated
upon
my
word
puffin
i
ashamed
of
myself
for
ha
for
not
taking
my
defeat
better
he
said
a
man
no
business
to
let
a
game
ruffle
him
puffin
gave
his
alto
cackling
laugh
oh
that
all
right
major
he
said
i
know
it
awfully
hard
to
lose
like
a
gentleman
he
let
this
sink
in
then
added
have
a
drink
old
chap
major
flint
flew
to
his
feet
well
thank
ye
thank
ye
he
said
now
where
that
soda
water
you
offered
me
just
now
he
shouted
to
the
steward
the
speed
and
completeness
of
the
reconciliation
was
in
no
way
remarkable
for
when
two
men
quarrel
whenever
they
meet
it
follows
that
they
make
it
up
again
with
corresponding
frequency
else
there
could
be
no
fresh
quarrels
at
all
this
one
had
been
a
shade
more
acute
than
most
and
the
drop
into
amity
again
was
a
shade
more
precipitous
major
flint
in
his
eagerness
had
put
most
of
his
moustache
into
the
tumbler
and
dried
it
on
his
handkerchief
after
all
it
was
a
most
amusing
incident
he
said
there
was
i
with
my
back
turned
waiting
for
you
to
give
it
up
when
your
bl
wretched
little
ball
hit
my
foot
i
must
remember
that
i
serve
you
with
the
same
spoon
some
day
at
least
i
would
if
i
thought
it
sportsmanlike
well
well
enough
said
astonishing
good
whisky
that
of
yours
captain
puffin
helped
himself
to
rather
more
than
half
of
what
now
remained
in
the
flask
help
yourself
major
he
said
well
thank
ye
i
do
mind
if
i
do
he
said
reversing
the
flask
over
the
tumbler
there
a
good
tramp
in
front
of
us
now
that
the
last
tram
has
gone
tram
and
tramp
upon
my
word
i
half
a
mind
to
telephone
for
a
taxi
this
of
course
was
a
direct
hint
puffin
ought
clearly
to
pay
for
a
taxi
having
won
two
this
casual
drink
did
not
constitute
the
usual
drink
stood
by
the
winner
and
paid
for
with
cash
over
the
counter
a
drink
or
two
from
a
flask
was
not
the
same
thing
puffin
naturally
saw
it
in
another
light
he
had
paid
for
the
whisky
which
major
flint
had
drunk
or
owed
for
it
in
his
bill
that
was
money
just
as
much
as
a
florin
pushed
across
the
counter
but
he
was
so
excessively
pleased
with
himself
over
the
adroitness
with
which
he
had
claimed
the
last
hole
that
he
quite
overstepped
the
bounds
of
his
habitual
parsimony
well
you
trot
along
to
the
telephone
and
order
a
taxi
he
said
and
i
pay
for
it
done
with
you
said
the
other
their
comradeship
was
now
on
its
most
felicitous
level
again
and
they
sat
on
the
bench
outside
the
till
the
arrival
of
their
unusual
conveyance
lunching
at
the
poppits
asked
major
flint
yes
meet
you
there
good
bridge
afterwards
suppose
sure
to
be
wish
there
was
a
chance
of
more
fool
that
was
a
decent
tipple
all
but
the
if
i
had
had
all
the
old
brandy
that
was
served
for
my
ration
in
one
glass
and
all
the
champagne
in
another
i
should
have
been
better
content
captain
puffin
was
a
great
cynic
in
his
own
misogynistic
way
camouflage
for
the
fair
sex
he
said
a
woman
will
lick
up
half
a
bottle
of
brandy
if
it
called
and
ask
for
more
whereas
if
you
offered
her
a
small
brandy
and
soda
she
would
think
you
were
insulting
her
bless
them
the
funny
little
fairies
said
the
major
well
what
i
tell
you
is
true
major
said
puffin
there
old
mapp
teetotaller
she
calls
herself
but
she
played
a
part
in
that
fool
bit
rosy
i
thought
her
as
we
escorted
her
home
so
she
was
said
the
major
so
she
was
said
to
us
on
her
doorstep
as
if
she
thought
she
was
a
perfect
venus
ana
ana
something
anno
domini
giggled
puffin
well
well
we
all
get
long
in
the
tooth
in
time
said
major
flint
charitably
fine
figure
of
a
woman
though
eh
said
puffin
archly
now
none
of
your
ashore
captain
said
the
major
in
high
good
humour
i
not
a
marrying
man
any
more
than
you
are
better
if
i
had
been
perhaps
more
years
ago
than
i
care
to
think
about
dear
me
my
wound
going
to
trouble
me
what
do
you
do
for
it
major
asked
puffin
do
for
it
think
of
old
times
a
bit
over
my
diaries
going
to
let
the
world
have
a
look
at
them
some
day
asked
puffin
no
sir
i
am
not
said
major
flint
perhaps
a
hundred
years
hence
the
date
i
have
named
in
my
will
for
their
publication
someone
may
think
them
not
so
uninteresting
but
all
this
toasting
and
buttering
and
grilling
and
frying
your
friends
and
serving
them
up
hot
for
all
the
old
cats
at
a
to
mew
over
pah
puffin
was
silent
a
moment
in
appreciation
of
these
noble
sentiments
but
you
put
in
a
lot
of
work
over
them
he
said
at
length
often
when
i
going
up
to
bed
i
see
the
light
still
burning
in
your
window
and
if
it
comes
to
that
rejoined
the
major
i
sure
i
often
dozed
off
when
i
in
bed
and
woken
again
and
pulled
up
my
blind
and
what
not
and
there
your
light
still
burning
powerful
long
roads
those
old
romans
must
have
made
captain
the
ice
was
not
broken
but
it
was
cracking
in
all
directions
under
this
unexampled
thaw
the
two
had
clearly
indicated
a
mutual
suspicion
of
each
other
industrious
habits
after
dinner
they
had
never
got
quite
so
far
as
this
before
some
quarrel
had
congealed
the
surface
again
but
now
with
a
desperate
disagreement
just
behind
them
and
the
unusual
luxury
of
a
taxi
just
in
front
the
vernal
airs
continued
blowing
in
the
most
springlike
manner
yes
that
true
enough
said
puffin
long
roads
they
were
and
dry
roads
at
that
and
if
i
stuck
to
them
from
after
my
supper
every
evening
till
midnight
or
more
should
be
smothered
in
dust
unless
you
washed
the
dust
down
just
once
in
a
while
said
major
flint
just
so
an
exhausting
process
requires
a
little
stimulant
now
and
again
said
puffin
i
sit
in
my
chair
you
understand
and
perhaps
doze
for
a
bit
after
my
supper
and
then
get
my
maps
out
and
have
them
handy
beside
me
and
then
if
something
interesting
the
evening
paper
perhaps
i
have
a
look
at
it
and
bless
me
if
by
that
time
it
is
already
ten
or
eleven
and
it
seems
useless
to
tackle
archæology
then
and
i
just
just
while
away
the
time
till
i
sleepy
but
there
seems
to
be
a
sort
of
legend
among
the
ladies
here
that
i
a
great
student
of
local
topography
and
roman
roads
and
all
sorts
of
truck
and
i
find
it
better
to
leave
it
at
that
tiresome
to
go
into
long
explanations
in
fact
added
puffin
in
a
burst
of
confidence
the
study
i
done
on
roman
roads
these
last
six
months
would
cover
a
threepenny
piece
major
flint
gave
a
loud
choking
guffaw
and
beat
his
fat
leg
well
if
that
not
the
best
joke
i
heard
for
many
a
long
day
he
said
there
i
been
in
the
house
opposite
you
these
last
two
years
seeing
your
light
burning
late
night
after
night
and
thinking
to
myself
my
friend
puffin
still
at
it
fine
thing
to
be
an
enthusiastic
archæologist
like
that
that
makes
short
work
of
a
lonely
evening
for
him
if
he
so
buried
in
his
books
or
his
maps
mapps
ha
ha
that
he
does
seem
to
notice
whether
it
twelve
or
one
or
two
maybe
and
all
the
time
you
been
sitting
snoozing
and
boozing
in
your
chair
with
your
glass
handy
to
wash
the
dust
down
puffin
added
his
falsetto
cackle
to
this
merriment
and
often
i
thought
to
myself
he
said
my
friend
the
major
in
his
study
opposite
with
all
his
diaries
round
him
making
a
note
here
and
copying
an
extract
there
and
conferring
with
the
viceroy
one
day
and
reprimanding
the
maharajah
of
another
spending
the
evening
on
india
coral
strand
he
is
having
tiffin
and
shooting
tigers
and
gawd
knows
what
the
major
laughter
boomed
out
again
and
i
never
kept
a
diary
in
my
life
he
cried
why
there
enough
cream
in
this
situation
to
make
a
dishful
of
meringues
you
and
i
you
know
the
students
of
tilling
the
students
who
do
a
hard
day
work
when
all
the
pretty
ladies
have
gone
to
bed
often
and
often
has
old
i
mean
has
that
fine
woman
miss
mapp
told
me
that
i
work
too
hard
at
night
recommended
me
to
get
earlier
to
bed
and
do
my
work
between
six
and
eight
in
the
morning
six
and
eight
in
the
morning
that
a
queer
time
of
day
to
recommend
an
old
campaigner
to
be
awake
at
often
she
talked
to
you
too
i
bet
my
hat
about
sitting
up
late
and
exhausting
the
nervous
faculties
major
flint
choked
and
laughed
and
inhaled
tobacco
smoke
till
he
got
purple
in
the
face
and
you
sitting
up
one
side
of
the
street
he
gasped
pretending
to
be
interested
in
roman
roads
and
me
on
the
other
pulling
a
long
face
over
my
diaries
and
neither
of
us
with
a
roman
road
or
a
diary
to
our
names
let
have
an
end
to
such
unsociable
arrangements
old
friend
you
bring
your
roman
roads
and
the
bottle
to
lay
the
dust
over
to
me
one
night
and
i
bring
my
diaries
and
my
peg
over
to
you
the
next
never
drink
alone
one
of
my
maxims
in
life
if
you
can
find
someone
to
drink
with
you
and
there
were
you
within
a
few
yards
of
me
all
the
time
sitting
by
your
old
solitary
self
and
there
was
i
sitting
by
my
old
solitary
self
and
we
each
thought
the
other
a
old
buffer
busy
on
his
i
blessed
if
i
heard
of
two
such
pompous
old
frauds
as
you
and
i
captain
what
a
sight
of
hypocrisy
there
is
in
the
world
to
be
sure
no
offence
mind
i
as
bad
as
you
and
you
as
bad
as
me
and
we
both
as
bad
as
each
other
but
no
more
solitary
confinement
of
an
evening
for
benjamin
flint
as
long
as
you
agreeable
the
advent
of
the
taxi
was
announced
and
arm
in
arm
they
limped
down
the
steep
path
together
to
the
road
a
little
way
off
to
the
left
was
the
great
bunker
which
primarily
was
the
cause
of
their
present
amity
as
they
drove
by
it
the
major
waggled
his
red
hand
at
it
au
reservoir
he
said
back
again
soon
it
was
late
that
night
when
miss
mapp
felt
that
she
was
physically
incapable
of
tacking
on
a
single
poppy
more
to
the
edge
of
her
skirt
and
went
to
the
window
of
the
where
she
had
been
working
to
close
it
she
glanced
up
at
the
top
story
of
her
own
house
and
saw
that
the
lights
in
the
servants
rooms
were
out
she
glanced
to
the
right
and
concluded
that
her
gardener
had
gone
to
bed
finally
she
glanced
down
the
street
and
saw
with
a
pang
of
pleasure
that
the
windows
of
the
major
house
showed
no
sign
of
midnight
labour
this
was
intensely
gratifying
it
indicated
that
her
influence
was
at
work
in
him
for
in
response
to
her
wish
so
often
and
so
tactfully
urged
on
him
that
he
would
go
to
bed
earlier
and
not
work
so
hard
at
night
here
was
the
darkened
window
and
she
dismissed
as
unworthy
the
suspicion
which
had
been
aroused
by
the
fool
the
window
of
his
bedroom
was
dark
too
he
must
have
already
put
out
his
light
and
miss
mapp
made
haste
over
her
little
tidyings
so
that
she
might
not
be
found
a
transgressor
to
her
own
precepts
but
there
was
a
light
in
captain
puffin
house
he
had
a
less
impressionable
nature
than
the
major
and
was
in
so
many
ways
far
inferior
and
did
he
really
find
roman
roads
so
wonderfully
exhilarating
miss
mapp
sincerely
hoped
that
he
did
and
that
it
was
nothing
else
of
less
pure
and
innocent
allurement
that
kept
him
up
as
she
closed
the
window
very
gently
it
did
just
seem
to
her
that
there
had
been
something
equally
baffling
in
major
egoistical
vigils
over
his
diaries
that
she
had
wondered
whether
there
was
not
something
else
she
had
hardly
formulated
what
which
kept
his
lights
burning
so
late
but
she
would
now
cross
him
dear
man
and
his
late
habits
out
of
the
list
of
riddles
about
tilling
which
awaited
solution
whatever
it
had
been
diaries
or
what
not
that
used
to
keep
him
up
he
had
broken
the
habit
now
whereas
captain
puffin
had
not
she
took
her
skirt
over
her
arm
and
smiled
her
thankful
way
to
bed
she
could
allow
herself
to
wonder
with
a
little
more
definiteness
now
that
the
major
lights
were
out
and
he
was
abed
what
it
could
be
which
rendered
captain
puffin
so
oblivious
to
the
passage
of
time
when
he
was
investigating
roman
roads
how
glad
she
was
that
the
major
was
not
with
him
benjamin
flint
she
said
to
herself
as
having
put
her
window
open
she
trod
softly
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
slumberer
next
door
across
her
room
on
her
fat
white
feet
to
her
big
white
bed
major
benjy
she
whispered
as
she
put
her
light
out
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
diva
would
act
on
miss
mapp
alarming
hints
that
morning
as
to
the
fate
of
and
give
say
a
ton
of
fuel
to
the
hospital
at
once
in
lieu
of
her
usual
smaller
christmas
contribution
without
making
further
inquiries
in
the
proper
quarters
as
to
the
legal
liabilities
of
having
so
she
ascertained
three
tons
in
her
cellar
and
as
soon
as
her
visitor
had
left
her
this
morning
she
popped
out
to
see
wootten
her
she
returned
in
a
state
of
fury
for
there
were
no
regulations
whatever
in
existence
with
regard
to
the
amount
of
coal
that
any
householder
might
choose
to
amass
and
wootten
complimented
her
on
her
prudence
in
having
got
in
a
reasonable
supply
for
he
thought
it
quite
probable
that
if
the
coal
strike
took
place
there
would
be
some
difficulty
in
month
time
from
now
in
replenishing
cellars
but
we
had
a
good
supply
all
the
summer
added
agreeable
wootten
and
all
my
customers
have
got
their
cellars
well
stocked
diva
rapidly
recollected
that
the
perfidious
elizabeth
was
among
them
o
but
wootten
she
said
miss
mapp
popped
dropped
in
to
see
me
just
now
told
me
she
had
hardly
got
any
wootten
turned
up
his
ledger
it
was
not
etiquette
to
disclose
the
affairs
of
one
client
to
another
but
if
there
was
a
cantankerous
customer
one
who
was
never
satisfied
with
prices
and
quality
that
client
was
miss
mapp
he
allowed
a
broad
grin
to
overspread
his
agreeable
face
well
if
in
a
month
time
i
short
of
coal
there
are
friends
of
yours
in
tilling
who
can
let
you
have
plenty
he
permitted
himself
to
say
it
was
idle
to
attempt
to
cut
out
bunches
of
roses
while
her
hand
was
so
feverish
and
she
trundled
up
and
down
the
high
street
to
cool
off
had
she
not
been
so
prudent
as
to
make
inquiries
as
likely
as
not
she
would
have
sent
a
ton
of
coal
that
very
day
to
the
hospital
so
strongly
had
elizabeth
perfidious
warning
inflamed
her
imagination
as
to
the
fate
of
hoarders
and
all
the
time
elizabeth
own
cellars
were
glutted
though
she
had
asserted
that
she
was
almost
fuelless
why
she
must
have
in
her
possession
more
coal
than
diva
herself
since
wootten
had
clearly
implied
that
it
was
elizabeth
who
could
be
borrowed
from
and
all
because
of
a
wretched
piece
of
worsted
by
degrees
she
calmed
down
for
it
was
no
use
attempting
to
plan
revenge
with
a
brain
at
she
must
be
calm
and
icily
ingenious
as
the
went
on
she
began
to
wonder
whether
it
was
worsted
alone
that
had
prompted
her
friend
diabolical
suggestion
it
seemed
more
likely
that
another
motive
one
strangely
elizabethan
was
the
cause
of
it
elizabeth
might
be
taken
for
certain
as
being
a
herself
and
it
was
ever
so
like
her
to
divert
suspicion
by
pretending
her
cellar
was
next
to
empty
she
had
been
equally
severe
on
any
who
might
happen
to
be
hoarding
food
in
case
transport
was
disarranged
and
supplies
fell
short
and
with
a
sudden
flare
of
authentic
intuition
diva
mind
blazed
with
the
conjecture
that
elizabeth
was
hoarding
food
as
well
luck
ever
attends
the
bold
and
constructive
thinker
the
apple
for
instance
fell
from
the
tree
precisely
when
newton
mind
was
groping
after
the
law
of
gravity
and
as
diva
stepped
into
her
grocer
to
begin
her
morning
shopping
for
she
had
been
occupied
with
roses
ever
since
breakfast
the
attendant
was
at
the
telephone
at
the
back
of
the
shop
he
spoke
in
a
lucid
we
only
two
of
the
big
tins
of
corned
beef
he
said
and
there
was
a
pause
during
which
to
a
psychic
diva
ears
might
have
seemed
to
grow
as
pointed
with
attention
as
a
satyr
but
she
could
only
hear
little
hollow
quacks
from
the
other
end
tongue
as
well
very
good
i
send
them
up
at
once
he
added
and
came
forward
into
the
shop
good
morning
said
diva
her
voice
was
tremulous
with
anxiety
and
investigation
got
any
big
tins
of
corned
beef
the
ones
that
contain
six
pounds
very
sorry
we
only
got
two
and
they
just
been
ordered
a
small
pot
of
ginger
then
please
said
diva
recklessly
will
you
send
it
round
immediately
yes
the
boy
just
going
out
that
was
luck
diva
hurried
into
the
street
and
was
absorbed
by
the
headlines
of
the
news
outside
the
stationer
this
was
a
favourite
place
for
observation
for
you
appeared
to
be
quite
taken
up
by
the
topics
of
the
day
and
kept
an
oblique
eye
on
the
true
object
of
your
scrutiny
she
had
not
got
to
wait
long
for
almost
immediately
the
grocer
boy
came
out
of
the
shop
with
a
heavy
basket
on
his
arm
delivered
the
small
pot
of
ginger
at
her
own
door
and
proceeded
along
the
street
he
was
unfortunately
a
popular
and
a
conversational
youth
who
had
a
great
deal
to
say
to
his
friends
and
the
period
of
waiting
to
see
if
he
would
turn
up
the
steep
street
that
led
to
miss
mapp
house
was
very
protracted
at
the
corner
he
deliberately
put
down
the
basket
altogether
and
lit
a
cigarette
and
never
had
diva
so
acutely
deplored
the
spread
of
the
among
the
juvenile
population
having
refreshed
himself
he
turned
up
the
steep
street
he
passed
the
fishmonger
and
the
fruiterer
he
did
not
take
the
turn
down
to
the
dentist
and
wyse
he
had
no
errand
to
the
house
or
to
the
captain
then
oh
then
he
rang
the
bell
at
miss
mapp
back
door
all
the
time
diva
had
been
following
him
keeping
her
head
well
down
so
as
to
avert
the
possibility
of
observation
from
the
window
of
the
and
walking
so
slowly
that
the
motion
of
her
feet
seemed
not
circular
at
all
then
the
bell
was
answered
and
he
delivered
into
withers
hands
one
two
tins
of
corned
beef
and
a
round
he
put
the
basket
on
his
head
and
came
down
the
street
again
shrilly
whistling
if
diva
had
had
any
reasonably
small
change
in
her
pocket
she
would
assuredly
have
given
him
some
small
share
in
it
lacking
this
she
trundled
home
with
all
speed
and
began
cutting
out
roses
with
swift
and
certain
strokes
of
the
now
she
had
already
noticed
that
elizabeth
had
paid
visits
to
the
grocer
on
three
consecutive
days
three
consecutive
days
think
of
it
and
given
that
her
purchases
on
other
occasions
had
been
on
the
same
substantial
scale
as
it
became
a
matter
of
thrilling
interest
as
to
where
she
kept
these
stores
she
could
not
keep
them
in
the
coal
cellar
for
that
was
already
bursting
with
coal
and
diva
who
had
assisted
her
the
base
one
in
making
a
prodigious
quantity
of
jam
that
year
from
her
garden
was
aware
that
the
kitchen
cupboards
were
like
to
be
as
replete
as
the
before
those
hoardings
of
dead
oxen
began
then
there
was
the
big
cupboard
under
the
stairs
but
that
could
scarcely
be
the
site
of
this
prodigious
cache
for
it
was
full
of
cardboard
and
curtains
and
carpets
and
all
the
rubbishy
accumulations
which
elizabeth
could
not
bear
to
part
with
then
she
had
large
cupboards
in
her
bedroom
and
spare
rooms
full
to
overflowing
of
mouldy
clothes
but
there
was
positively
not
another
cupboard
in
the
house
that
diva
knew
of
and
she
crushed
her
temples
in
her
hands
in
the
attempt
to
locate
the
of
the
hoard
diva
suddenly
jumped
up
with
a
happy
squeal
of
discovery
and
in
her
excitement
snapped
her
scissors
with
so
random
a
stroke
that
she
completely
cut
in
half
the
bunch
of
roses
that
she
was
engaged
on
there
was
another
cupboard
the
best
and
biggest
of
all
and
the
most
secret
and
the
most
discreet
it
lay
embedded
in
the
wall
of
the
cloaked
and
concealed
behind
the
shelves
of
a
false
which
contained
no
more
than
the
simulacra
of
books
just
books
with
titles
that
had
never
yet
appeared
on
any
honest
book
there
were
twelve
volumes
of
the
beauties
of
nature
a
shelf
full
of
elegant
extracts
there
were
volumes
simply
called
poems
there
were
commentaries
there
were
travels
and
astronomy
and
the
lowest
and
tallest
shelf
was
full
of
music
a
habitually
stood
in
front
of
this
false
repository
of
learning
and
it
was
only
last
week
that
diva
prying
casually
round
the
room
while
elizabeth
had
gone
to
take
off
her
had
noticed
a
modest
catch
let
into
the
without
doubt
then
the
was
the
door
of
the
cupboard
and
with
a
stroke
of
intuition
too
sure
to
be
called
a
guess
diva
was
aware
that
she
had
correctly
inferred
the
storage
of
this
nefarious
hoard
it
only
remained
to
verify
her
conclusion
and
if
possible
expose
it
with
every
circumstance
of
public
ignominy
she
was
in
no
hurry
she
could
bide
her
time
aware
that
in
all
probability
every
day
that
passed
would
see
an
addition
to
its
damning
contents
some
day
when
she
was
playing
bridge
and
the
had
been
moved
out
in
some
rubber
when
she
herself
was
dummy
and
elizabeth
greedily
playing
the
hand
she
would
secretly
and
accidentally
press
the
catch
which
her
acute
vision
had
so
providentially
revealed
to
her
she
attacked
her
chintz
curtains
again
with
her
appetite
for
the
pink
roses
agreeably
whetted
another
hour
work
would
give
her
sufficient
bunches
for
her
purpose
and
unless
the
dyer
was
as
perfidious
as
elizabeth
her
now
purple
jacket
and
skirt
would
arrive
that
afternoon
two
days
hard
work
would
be
sufficient
for
so
accomplished
a
needlewoman
as
herself
to
make
these
original
decorations
in
the
meantime
for
diva
was
never
idle
and
was
chiefly
occupied
with
dress
she
got
out
a
certain
american
fashion
paper
there
was
in
it
the
description
of
a
worn
by
titus
trout
which
she
believed
was
within
her
dressmaking
capacity
she
would
attempt
it
anyhow
and
if
it
proved
to
be
beyond
her
she
could
entrust
the
more
difficult
parts
to
that
little
dressmaker
whom
elizabeth
employed
and
who
was
certainly
very
capable
but
the
costume
was
of
so
daring
and
splendid
a
nature
that
she
feared
to
take
anyone
into
her
confidence
about
it
lest
some
hint
or
gossip
for
tilling
was
a
gossipy
place
might
leak
out
kingfisher
blue
it
made
her
mouth
water
to
dwell
on
the
sumptuous
syllables
miss
mapp
was
so
feverishly
occupied
all
next
morning
with
the
application
of
poppies
to
the
skirt
that
she
paid
very
little
attention
to
the
opening
gambits
of
the
day
either
as
regards
the
world
in
general
or
more
particularly
major
benjy
after
his
early
retirement
last
night
he
was
probably
up
with
the
lark
this
morning
and
when
between
ten
and
eleven
his
sonorous
sounded
through
her
open
window
the
shock
she
experienced
interrupted
for
a
moment
her
floral
industry
it
was
certainly
very
odd
that
having
gone
to
bed
at
so
respectable
an
hour
last
night
he
should
be
calling
for
his
porridge
only
now
but
with
an
impulse
of
unusual
optimism
she
figured
him
as
having
been
at
work
on
his
diaries
before
breakfast
and
in
that
absorbing
occupation
having
forgotten
how
late
it
was
growing
that
no
doubt
was
the
explanation
though
it
would
be
nice
to
know
for
certain
if
the
information
positively
forced
itself
on
her
notice
as
she
worked
framing
her
lips
with
elaborate
motions
to
the
syllables
she
dumbly
practised
the
phrase
major
benjy
sometimes
in
moments
of
gallantry
he
called
her
miss
elizabeth
and
she
meant
when
she
had
got
accustomed
to
it
by
practice
to
say
major
benjy
to
him
by
accident
and
he
would
no
doubt
beg
her
to
make
a
habit
of
that
friendly
slip
of
the
tongue
tongue
led
to
a
new
train
of
thought
and
presently
she
paused
in
her
work
and
pulling
the
away
from
the
deceptive
she
pressed
the
concealed
catch
of
the
door
and
peeped
in
there
was
still
room
for
further
small
precautions
against
starvation
owing
to
the
impending
and
she
took
stock
of
her
provisions
even
if
the
strike
lasted
quite
a
long
time
there
would
now
be
no
immediate
lack
of
the
necessaries
of
life
for
the
cupboard
glistened
with
tinned
meats
and
the
had
sent
a
very
sensible
sack
this
with
considerable
exertion
she
transferred
to
a
high
shelf
in
the
cupboard
instead
of
allowing
it
to
remain
standing
on
the
floor
for
withers
had
informed
her
of
an
unpleasant
rumour
about
a
mouse
which
mary
had
observed
lost
in
thought
in
front
of
the
cupboard
so
mousie
shall
only
find
tins
on
the
floor
now
thought
miss
mapp
mousie
shall
try
his
teeth
on
tins
there
was
tea
and
coffee
in
abundance
jars
of
jam
filled
the
kitchen
shelves
and
if
this
morning
she
laid
in
a
moderate
supply
of
dried
fruits
there
was
no
reason
to
face
the
future
with
anything
but
fortitude
she
would
see
about
that
now
for
busy
though
she
was
she
could
not
miss
the
would
diva
she
wondered
be
at
her
window
snipping
roses
out
of
chintz
curtains
the
careful
thrifty
soul
perhaps
this
time
diva
looking
out
of
her
window
would
see
that
somebody
else
had
been
quicker
about
being
thrifty
than
she
that
would
be
fun
the
major
window
was
open
and
as
miss
mapp
passed
it
she
could
not
help
hearing
loud
angry
remarks
about
eggs
coming
from
inside
that
made
it
clear
that
he
was
still
at
breakfast
and
that
if
he
had
been
working
at
his
diaries
in
the
fresh
morning
hours
and
forgetting
the
time
early
rising
in
spite
of
his
early
retirement
last
night
could
not
be
supposed
to
suit
his
oriental
temper
but
a
change
of
habits
was
invariably
known
to
be
upsetting
and
miss
mapp
was
hopeful
that
in
a
day
or
two
he
would
feel
quite
a
different
man
further
down
the
street
was
quaint
irene
lounging
at
the
door
of
her
new
studio
a
converted
smoking
a
cigarette
and
dressed
like
a
jockey
hullo
mapp
she
said
come
and
have
a
look
round
my
new
studio
you
have
seen
it
yet
i
shall
give
a
next
week
miss
mapp
tried
to
steel
herself
for
the
hundredth
time
to
appear
quite
unconscious
that
she
was
being
addressed
when
irene
said
mapp
in
that
odious
manner
but
she
never
could
summon
up
sufficient
nerve
to
be
rude
to
so
awful
a
mimic
good
morning
dear
one
she
said
sycophantically
shall
i
peep
in
for
a
moment
the
decoration
of
the
studio
was
even
more
appalling
than
might
have
been
expected
there
was
a
german
stove
in
the
corner
made
of
pink
porcelain
the
rafters
and
roof
were
painted
scarlet
the
walls
were
of
magenta
distemper
and
the
floor
was
blue
in
the
corner
was
a
very
large
screen
the
walls
were
hung
with
specimens
of
irene
art
there
was
a
stout
female
with
no
clothes
on
at
all
whom
it
was
impossible
not
to
recognize
as
being
lucy
there
were
studies
of
fat
legs
and
ample
bosoms
and
on
the
easel
was
a
picture
evidently
in
process
of
completion
which
represented
a
man
from
this
miss
mapp
instantly
averted
her
eyes
eve
said
irene
pointing
to
lucy
miss
mapp
naturally
guessed
that
the
gentleman
who
was
almost
in
the
same
costume
was
adam
and
turned
completely
away
from
him
and
what
a
lovely
idea
to
have
a
blue
floor
dear
she
said
how
original
you
are
and
that
pretty
scarlet
ceiling
but
do
you
find
when
you
painting
that
all
these
bright
colours
disturb
you
not
a
bit
they
stimulate
your
sense
of
colour
miss
mapp
moved
towards
the
screen
what
a
delicious
big
screen
she
said
yes
but
do
go
behind
it
mapp
said
irene
or
you
see
my
model
undressing
miss
mapp
retreated
from
it
precipitately
as
from
a
wasp
nest
and
examined
some
of
the
studies
on
the
wall
for
it
was
more
than
probable
from
the
unfinished
picture
on
the
easel
that
adam
lurked
behind
the
delicious
screen
terrible
though
it
all
was
she
was
conscious
of
an
unbridled
curiosity
to
know
who
adam
was
it
was
dreadful
to
think
that
there
could
be
any
man
in
tilling
so
depraved
as
to
stand
to
be
looked
at
with
so
little
on
irene
strolled
round
the
walls
with
her
studies
of
lucy
she
said
i
see
dear
said
miss
mapp
how
clever
legs
and
things
but
when
you
have
your
wo
you
perhaps
cover
some
of
them
up
or
turn
them
to
the
wall
we
should
all
be
looking
at
your
pictures
instead
of
attending
to
our
cards
and
if
you
were
thinking
of
asking
the
padre
you
know
they
were
approaching
the
corner
of
the
room
where
the
screen
stood
when
a
movement
there
as
if
adam
had
hit
it
with
his
elbow
made
miss
mapp
turn
round
the
screen
fell
flat
on
the
ground
and
within
a
yard
of
her
stood
hopkins
the
proprietor
of
the
just
up
the
street
often
and
often
had
miss
mapp
had
pleasant
little
conversations
with
him
with
a
view
to
bringing
down
the
price
of
flounders
he
had
little
on
hullo
hopkins
are
you
ready
said
irene
you
know
miss
mapp
you
miss
mapp
had
not
imagined
that
time
and
eternity
combined
could
hold
so
embarrassing
a
moment
she
did
not
know
where
to
look
but
wherever
she
looked
it
should
not
be
at
hopkins
but
wherever
she
looked
she
could
not
be
unaware
that
hopkins
raised
his
large
bare
arm
and
touched
the
place
where
his
cap
would
have
been
if
he
had
had
one
hopkins
she
said
well
irene
darling
i
must
be
trotting
and
leave
you
to
your
she
hardly
knew
what
to
call
it
to
your
work
she
tripped
from
the
room
which
seemed
to
be
entirely
full
of
unclothed
limbs
and
redder
than
one
of
hopkins
boiled
lobsters
hurried
down
the
street
she
felt
that
she
could
never
face
him
again
but
would
be
obliged
to
go
to
the
establishment
in
the
high
street
where
irene
dealt
when
it
was
fish
she
wanted
from
a
her
head
was
in
a
whirl
at
the
brazenness
of
mankind
especially
womankind
how
had
irene
started
the
overtures
that
led
to
this
had
she
just
said
to
hopkins
one
morning
will
you
come
to
my
studio
and
take
off
all
your
clothes
if
irene
had
not
been
such
a
wonderful
mimic
she
would
certainly
have
felt
it
her
duty
to
go
straight
to
the
padre
and
pulling
down
her
veil
confide
to
him
the
whole
sad
story
but
as
that
was
out
of
the
question
she
went
into
twenlow
and
ordered
four
pounds
of
dried
apricots
chapter
iv
the
dyer
as
diva
had
feared
proved
perfidious
and
it
was
not
till
the
next
morning
that
her
maid
brought
her
the
parcel
containing
the
coat
and
skirt
of
the
projected
costume
diva
had
already
done
her
marketing
so
that
she
might
have
no
other
calls
on
her
time
to
interfere
with
the
tacking
on
of
the
bunches
of
pink
roses
and
she
hoped
to
have
the
dress
finished
in
time
for
elizabeth
afternoon
next
day
an
invitation
to
which
had
just
reached
her
she
had
also
settled
to
have
a
cold
lunch
so
that
her
cook
as
well
as
her
parlourmaid
could
devote
themselves
to
the
job
she
herself
had
taken
the
jacket
for
decoration
and
was
just
tacking
the
first
rose
on
to
the
collar
when
she
looked
out
of
the
window
and
what
she
saw
caused
her
needle
to
fall
from
her
nerveless
hand
tripping
along
the
opposite
pavement
was
elizabeth
she
had
on
a
dress
the
material
of
which
after
a
moment
gaze
diva
identified
it
was
that
coat
and
skirt
which
she
had
worn
so
much
last
spring
but
the
collar
the
cuffs
the
waistband
and
the
hem
of
the
skirt
were
covered
with
staring
red
poppies
next
moment
she
called
to
remembrance
the
chintz
that
had
once
covered
elizabeth
sofa
in
the
diva
wasted
no
time
but
rang
the
bell
she
had
to
make
certain
janet
she
said
go
straight
out
into
the
high
street
and
walk
close
behind
miss
mapp
look
very
carefully
at
her
dress
see
if
the
poppies
on
it
are
of
chintz
janet
face
fell
why
she
never
gone
and
she
began
quick
said
diva
in
a
strangled
voice
diva
watched
from
her
window
janet
went
out
looked
this
way
and
that
spied
the
quarry
and
skimmed
up
the
high
street
on
feet
that
twinkled
as
fast
as
her
mistress
she
came
back
much
out
of
breath
with
speed
and
indignation
yes
she
said
they
chintz
sure
enough
tacked
on
too
just
as
you
were
meaning
to
do
oh
janet
quite
appreciated
the
magnitude
of
the
calamity
and
her
voice
failed
what
are
we
to
do
she
added
diva
did
not
reply
for
a
moment
but
sat
with
eyes
closed
in
profound
and
concentrated
thought
it
required
no
reflection
to
decide
how
impossible
it
was
to
appear
herself
in
a
dress
which
seemed
to
ape
the
costume
which
all
tilling
had
seen
elizabeth
wearing
and
at
first
it
looked
as
if
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
with
all
those
laboriously
acquired
bunches
of
rosebuds
for
it
was
clearly
out
of
the
question
to
use
them
as
the
decoration
for
any
costume
and
idle
to
think
of
sewing
them
back
into
the
snipped
and
gashed
curtains
she
looked
at
the
purple
skirt
and
coat
that
hungered
for
their
flowers
and
then
she
looked
at
janet
janet
was
a
short
roundabout
person
it
was
supposed
that
she
had
much
the
same
figure
as
her
mistress
then
the
light
broke
dazzling
and
diabolical
and
diva
bounced
to
her
feet
blinded
by
its
splendour
my
coat
and
skirt
are
yours
janet
she
said
get
with
the
work
both
of
you
bustle
cover
it
with
roses
have
it
finished
wear
it
wear
it
always
she
gave
a
loud
cackle
of
laughter
and
threaded
her
needle
lor
said
janet
admiringly
that
a
teaser
and
thank
you
it
was
roses
roses
all
the
way
diva
had
quite
miscalculated
the
number
required
and
there
were
sufficient
not
only
to
cover
collar
cuffs
and
border
of
the
skirt
with
them
but
to
make
another
line
of
them
six
inches
above
the
hem
original
and
gorgeous
as
the
dress
would
be
it
was
yet
a
sort
of
parody
of
elizabeth
costume
which
was
attracting
so
much
interest
and
attention
as
she
popped
in
and
out
of
shops
that
would
be
worn
by
janet
and
janet
or
diva
was
much
mistaken
should
encourage
her
friends
to
get
permission
to
use
up
old
bits
of
chintz
very
likely
chintz
decoration
would
become
quite
a
vogue
among
the
servant
maids
of
tilling
how
elizabeth
had
got
hold
of
the
idea
mattered
nothing
but
anyhow
she
would
be
surfeited
with
the
idea
before
diva
had
finished
with
her
it
was
possible
of
course
anything
was
possible
that
it
had
occurred
to
her
independently
but
diva
was
loath
to
give
so
innocent
an
ancestry
to
her
adoption
of
it
it
was
far
more
sensible
to
take
for
granted
that
she
had
got
wind
of
invention
by
some
odious
underhand
piece
of
spying
what
that
might
be
must
be
investigated
and
probably
determined
later
but
at
present
the
business
of
janet
roses
eclipsed
every
other
interest
miss
mapp
shopping
that
morning
was
unusually
prolonged
for
it
was
important
that
every
woman
in
tilling
should
see
the
poppies
on
the
ground
and
know
that
she
had
worn
that
dress
before
diva
appeared
in
some
mean
adaptation
of
it
though
the
total
cost
of
her
entire
purchases
hardly
amounted
to
a
shilling
she
went
in
and
out
of
an
amazing
number
of
shops
and
made
a
prodigious
series
of
inquiries
into
the
price
of
commodities
that
ranged
from
to
and
often
entered
a
shop
twice
because
wreathed
in
smiling
apologies
for
her
stupidity
she
had
forgotten
what
she
was
told
the
first
time
by
twelve
she
was
satisfied
that
practically
everybody
with
one
exception
had
seen
her
and
that
her
costume
had
aroused
a
deep
sense
of
jealousy
and
angry
admiration
so
cunning
was
the
handiwork
of
herself
withers
and
mary
that
she
felt
fairly
sure
that
no
one
had
the
slightest
notion
of
how
this
decoration
of
poppies
was
accomplished
for
evie
had
run
round
her
in
small
circles
murmuring
to
herself
very
effective
idea
is
it
woven
into
the
cloth
elizabeth
dear
me
i
wonder
where
i
could
get
some
like
it
and
poppit
had
followed
her
all
up
the
street
with
eyes
glued
to
the
hem
of
her
skirt
and
a
completely
puzzled
face
but
then
so
thought
elizabeth
sweetly
even
members
of
the
order
of
the
british
empire
ca
have
everything
their
own
way
as
for
the
major
he
had
simply
come
to
a
dead
stop
when
he
bounced
out
of
his
house
as
she
passed
and
said
something
very
gallant
and
appropriate
even
the
absence
of
that
one
inhabitant
of
tilling
dear
diva
did
not
strike
a
jarring
note
in
this
pæan
of
triumph
for
miss
mapp
was
quite
satisfied
that
diva
was
busy
indoors
working
her
fingers
to
the
bone
over
the
application
of
bunches
of
roses
and
as
usual
she
was
perfectly
correct
in
her
conjecture
but
dear
diva
would
have
to
see
the
new
frock
afternoon
at
the
latest
when
she
came
to
the
perhaps
she
would
then
for
the
first
time
be
wearing
the
roses
herself
and
everybody
would
very
pleasantly
pity
her
this
was
so
rapturous
a
thought
that
when
miss
mapp
after
her
prolonged
shopping
and
with
her
almost
empty
basket
passed
hopkins
standing
outside
his
shop
on
her
return
home
again
she
gave
him
her
usual
smile
though
without
meeting
his
eye
and
tried
to
forget
how
much
of
him
she
had
seen
yesterday
perhaps
she
might
speak
to
him
and
gradually
resume
ordinary
relations
for
the
prices
at
the
other
fish
shop
were
as
high
as
the
quality
of
the
fish
was
low
she
told
herself
that
there
was
nothing
actually
immoral
in
the
human
skin
however
embarrassing
it
was
miss
mapp
had
experienced
a
cruel
disappointment
last
night
though
the
triumph
of
this
morning
had
done
something
to
soothe
it
for
major
benjy
window
had
certainly
been
lit
up
to
a
very
late
hour
and
so
it
was
clear
that
he
had
not
been
able
twice
in
succession
to
tear
himself
away
from
his
diaries
or
whatever
else
detained
him
and
go
to
bed
at
a
proper
time
captain
puffin
however
had
not
sat
up
late
indeed
he
must
have
gone
to
bed
quite
unusually
early
for
his
window
was
dark
by
nine
again
the
position
was
reversed
and
it
seemed
that
major
benjy
was
good
and
captain
puffin
was
bad
on
the
whole
then
there
was
cause
for
thankfulness
and
as
she
added
a
tin
of
biscuits
and
two
jars
of
bovril
to
her
prudent
stores
she
found
herself
a
conscious
sceptic
about
those
roman
roads
diaries
perhaps
were
a
little
different
for
egoism
was
a
more
potent
force
than
archæology
and
for
her
part
she
now
definitely
believed
that
roman
roads
spelt
some
form
of
drink
she
was
sorry
to
believe
it
but
it
was
her
duty
to
believe
something
of
the
kind
and
she
really
did
not
know
what
else
to
believe
she
did
not
go
so
far
as
mentally
to
accuse
him
of
drunkenness
but
considering
the
way
he
absorbed
fool
it
was
clear
that
he
was
no
foe
to
alcohol
and
probably
watered
the
roman
roads
with
it
with
her
vivid
imagination
she
pictured
him
miss
mapp
recalled
herself
from
this
melancholy
reflection
and
put
up
her
hand
just
in
time
to
save
a
bottle
of
bovril
which
she
had
put
on
the
top
shelf
in
front
of
the
sack
of
flour
from
tumbling
to
the
ground
with
the
latest
additions
she
had
made
to
her
larder
it
required
considerable
ingenuity
to
fit
all
the
tins
and
packages
in
and
for
a
while
she
diverted
her
mind
from
captain
puffin
drinking
to
her
own
eating
but
by
careful
packing
and
balancing
she
managed
to
stow
everything
away
with
sufficient
economy
of
space
to
allow
her
to
shut
the
door
and
then
put
the
in
place
again
it
was
then
late
and
with
a
fond
look
at
her
sweet
flowers
sleeping
in
the
moonlight
she
went
to
bed
captain
puffin
was
still
alight
and
even
as
she
deplored
this
his
shadow
in
profile
crossed
the
blind
shadows
were
queer
things
she
could
make
a
beautiful
on
the
wall
by
a
dexterous
interlacement
of
fingers
and
thumbs
and
certainly
this
shadow
in
the
momentary
glance
she
had
of
it
appeared
to
have
a
large
moustache
she
could
make
nothing
whatever
out
of
that
except
to
suppose
that
just
as
fingers
and
thumbs
became
a
rabbit
so
his
nose
became
a
moustache
for
he
could
not
have
grown
one
since
he
came
back
from
golf
she
was
out
early
for
her
shopping
next
morning
for
there
were
some
delicacies
to
be
purchased
for
her
more
particularly
some
little
chocolate
cakes
she
had
lately
discovered
which
looked
very
small
and
innocent
were
in
reality
of
so
cloying
and
substantial
a
nature
that
the
partaker
thereof
would
probably
not
feel
capable
of
making
any
serious
inroads
into
other
provisions
naturally
she
was
much
on
the
alert
for
it
was
more
than
possible
that
diva
dress
was
finished
and
in
evidence
what
colour
it
would
be
she
did
not
know
but
a
large
quantity
of
rosebuds
would
even
at
a
distance
make
identification
easy
diva
was
certainly
not
at
her
window
this
morning
so
it
seemed
more
than
probable
that
they
would
soon
meet
far
away
just
crossing
the
high
street
at
the
further
end
she
caught
sight
of
a
bright
patch
of
purple
very
much
of
the
required
shape
there
was
surely
a
pink
border
round
the
skirt
and
a
pink
panel
on
the
collar
and
just
as
surely
bartlett
recognizable
for
her
gliding
walk
was
moving
in
its
fascinating
wake
then
the
purple
patch
vanished
into
a
shop
and
miss
mapp
all
smiles
and
poppies
went
with
her
basket
up
the
street
presently
she
encountered
evie
who
also
all
smiles
seemed
to
have
some
communication
to
make
but
only
got
as
far
as
have
you
seen
when
she
gave
a
little
squeal
of
laughter
quite
inexplicable
and
glided
into
some
dark
entry
a
minute
afterwards
the
purple
patch
suddenly
appeared
from
a
shop
and
almost
collided
with
her
it
was
not
diva
at
all
but
diva
janet
the
shock
was
so
indescribably
severe
that
miss
mapp
smile
was
frozen
so
to
speak
as
by
some
sudden
congealment
on
to
her
face
and
did
not
thaw
off
it
till
she
had
reached
the
sharp
turn
at
the
end
of
the
street
where
she
leaned
heavily
on
the
railing
and
breathed
through
her
nose
a
light
autumnal
mist
overlay
the
miles
of
marsh
but
the
sun
was
already
drinking
it
up
promising
the
tillingites
another
golden
day
the
tidal
river
was
at
the
flood
and
the
bright
water
lapped
the
bases
of
the
banks
that
kept
it
within
its
course
beyond
that
was
the
towards
which
presently
major
benjy
and
captain
puffin
would
be
hurrying
to
catch
the
tram
that
would
take
them
out
to
the
golf
links
the
straight
road
across
the
marsh
was
visible
and
the
railway
bridge
all
these
things
were
pitilessly
unchanged
and
miss
mapp
noted
them
blankly
until
rage
began
to
restore
the
numbed
current
of
her
mental
processes
if
the
records
of
history
contained
any
similar
instance
of
such
treachery
and
low
cunning
as
was
involved
in
this
plot
of
diva
to
dress
janet
in
the
rosebud
chintz
miss
mapp
would
have
liked
to
be
told
clearly
and
distinctly
what
it
was
she
could
trace
the
workings
of
diva
base
mind
with
absolute
accuracy
and
if
all
the
archangels
in
the
hierarchy
of
heaven
had
assured
her
that
diva
had
originally
intended
the
rosebuds
for
janet
she
would
have
scorned
them
for
their
clumsy
perjury
diva
had
designed
and
executed
that
dress
for
herself
and
just
because
miss
mapp
ingenuity
inspired
by
the
two
rosebuds
that
had
fluttered
out
of
the
window
had
forestalled
her
she
had
taken
this
fiendish
revenge
it
was
impossible
to
pervade
the
high
street
covered
with
chintz
poppies
when
a
parlourmaid
was
being
equally
pervasive
in
chintz
rosebuds
and
what
was
to
be
done
with
this
frock
executed
with
such
mirth
and
malice
by
withers
mary
and
herself
she
had
no
idea
she
might
just
as
well
give
it
withers
for
she
could
no
longer
wear
it
herself
or
tear
the
poppies
from
the
hem
and
bestrew
the
high
street
with
them
miss
mapp
face
froze
into
immobility
again
for
here
trundling
swiftly
towards
her
was
diva
herself
diva
appeared
not
to
see
her
till
she
got
quite
close
morning
elizabeth
she
said
seen
my
janet
anywhere
no
said
miss
mapp
janet
no
doubt
according
to
instructions
received
popped
out
of
a
shop
and
came
towards
her
mistress
here
she
is
said
diva
all
right
janet
you
go
home
i
see
to
the
other
things
it
a
lovely
day
said
miss
mapp
beginning
to
lash
her
tail
so
bright
yes
pretty
trimming
of
poppies
said
diva
janet
got
rosebuds
this
was
too
much
diva
i
did
think
it
of
you
said
miss
mapp
in
a
shaking
voice
you
saw
my
new
frock
yesterday
and
you
were
filled
with
malice
and
envy
diva
just
because
i
had
thought
of
using
flowers
off
an
old
chintz
as
well
as
you
and
came
out
first
with
it
you
had
meant
to
wear
that
purple
frock
yourself
though
i
must
say
it
fits
janet
perfectly
and
just
because
i
was
first
in
the
field
you
did
this
you
gave
janet
that
frock
so
that
i
should
be
dressed
in
the
same
style
as
your
parlourmaid
and
you
got
a
black
heart
diva
that
nonsense
said
diva
firmly
heart
as
red
as
anybody
and
talking
of
black
hearts
does
become
elizabeth
you
knew
i
was
cutting
out
roses
from
my
curtains
miss
mapp
laughed
shrilly
well
if
i
happen
to
notice
that
you
taken
your
chintz
curtains
down
she
said
with
an
awful
distinctness
that
showed
the
of
which
diva
had
got
three
at
the
most
and
pink
bunches
of
roses
come
flying
out
of
your
window
into
the
high
street
even
my
poor
wits
small
as
they
are
are
equal
to
drawing
the
conclusion
that
you
are
cutting
roses
out
of
curtains
your
fondness
for
dress
did
the
rest
with
your
permission
diva
i
intend
to
draw
exactly
what
conclusions
i
please
on
every
occasion
including
this
one
ho
that
how
you
got
the
idea
then
said
diva
i
knew
you
had
cribbed
it
from
me
cribbed
asked
miss
mapp
in
ironical
ignorance
of
what
so
vulgar
and
slangy
an
expression
meant
cribbed
means
taking
what
is
yours
said
diva
even
then
if
you
had
only
acted
in
a
straightforward
manner
miss
mapp
shaken
as
with
palsy
regretted
that
she
had
let
slip
out
of
pure
childlike
joy
in
irony
the
manner
in
which
she
had
obtained
the
but
in
a
quarrel
regrets
are
useless
and
she
went
on
again
and
would
you
very
kindly
explain
how
or
when
i
have
acted
in
a
manner
that
was
not
straightforward
she
asked
with
laborious
politeness
or
do
i
understand
that
a
monopoly
of
cutting
up
chintz
curtains
for
personal
adornment
has
been
bestowed
on
you
by
act
of
parliament
you
knew
i
was
meaning
to
make
a
frock
with
chintz
roses
on
it
said
diva
you
stole
my
idea
worked
night
and
day
to
be
first
just
like
you
mean
behaviour
it
was
meaner
to
give
that
frock
to
janet
said
miss
mapp
you
can
give
yours
to
withers
snapped
diva
much
obliged
plaistow
said
miss
mapp
diva
had
been
watching
janet
retreating
figure
and
feeling
that
though
revenge
was
sweet
revenge
was
also
strangely
expensive
for
she
had
sacrificed
one
of
the
most
strikingly
successful
frocks
she
had
ever
made
on
that
smoking
altar
now
her
revenge
was
gratified
and
deeply
she
regretted
the
frock
miss
mapp
heart
was
similarly
wrung
by
torture
revenge
too
had
been
hers
general
revenge
on
diva
for
existing
but
this
dreadful
had
made
it
quite
impossible
for
her
to
enjoy
the
use
of
this
frock
any
more
for
she
could
not
habit
herself
like
a
housemaid
each
in
fact
had
as
matters
at
present
stood
completely
wrecked
the
other
like
two
express
trains
meeting
in
collision
and
since
the
quarrel
had
clearly
risen
to
its
utmost
height
there
was
no
farther
joy
of
battle
to
be
anticipated
but
only
the
melancholy
task
of
counting
the
corpses
so
they
paused
breathing
very
quickly
and
trembling
while
both
sought
for
some
way
out
besides
miss
mapp
had
a
this
afternoon
and
if
they
parted
now
in
this
extreme
state
of
tension
diva
might
conceivably
not
come
thereby
robbing
herself
of
her
bridge
and
spoiling
her
table
naturally
any
permanent
quarrel
was
not
contemplated
by
either
of
them
for
if
quarrels
were
permanent
in
tilling
nobody
would
be
on
speaking
terms
any
more
with
anyone
else
in
a
day
or
two
and
hardly
less
disastrous
there
could
be
no
fresh
quarrels
with
anybody
since
you
could
not
quarrel
without
words
there
might
be
songs
without
words
as
mendelssohn
had
proved
but
not
rows
without
words
by
what
formula
could
this
deadly
antagonism
be
bridged
without
delay
diva
gazed
out
over
the
marsh
she
wanted
desperately
to
regain
her
and
she
knew
that
elizabeth
was
starving
for
further
wearing
of
her
poppies
perhaps
the
wide
serene
plain
below
inspired
her
with
a
hatred
of
littleness
there
would
be
no
loss
of
dignity
in
making
a
proposal
that
her
enemy
she
felt
sure
would
accept
it
merely
showed
a
christian
spirit
and
set
an
example
to
elizabeth
to
make
the
first
move
janet
she
did
not
consider
if
you
are
in
a
fit
state
to
listen
to
reason
elizabeth
she
began
miss
mapp
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
diva
had
thought
of
something
she
swallowed
the
insult
at
a
gulp
yes
dear
she
said
got
an
idea
take
away
janet
frock
and
wear
it
myself
then
you
can
wear
yours
too
pretty
for
eh
a
heavenly
brightness
spread
over
miss
mapp
face
oh
how
wonderful
of
you
to
have
thought
of
that
diva
she
said
but
how
shall
we
explain
it
all
to
everybody
diva
clung
to
her
rights
though
clearly
christian
she
was
human
say
i
thought
of
tacking
chintz
on
and
told
you
she
said
yes
darling
said
elizabeth
that
beautiful
i
agree
but
poor
janet
i
give
her
some
other
old
thing
said
diva
good
sort
janet
wants
me
to
win
and
about
her
having
been
seen
wearing
it
say
she
has
ever
worn
it
say
they
mad
said
diva
miss
mapp
felt
it
better
to
tear
herself
away
before
she
began
distilling
all
sorts
of
acidities
that
welled
up
in
her
fruitful
mind
she
could
for
instance
easily
have
agreed
that
nothing
was
more
probable
than
that
janet
had
been
mistaken
for
her
mistress
au
reservoir
then
dear
she
said
tenderly
see
you
at
about
four
and
will
you
wear
your
pretty
rosebud
frock
this
was
agreed
to
and
diva
went
home
to
take
it
away
from
janet
the
reconciliation
of
course
was
strictly
confined
to
matters
relating
to
chintz
and
did
not
include
such
extraneous
subjects
as
or
and
even
in
the
first
glowing
moments
of
restored
friendliness
diva
began
wondering
whether
she
would
have
the
opportunity
that
afternoon
of
testing
the
truth
of
her
conjecture
about
the
cupboard
in
the
cudgel
her
brains
as
she
might
she
could
think
of
no
other
that
could
contain
the
immense
amount
of
provisions
that
elizabeth
had
probably
accumulated
and
she
was
all
on
fire
to
get
to
practical
grips
with
the
problem
as
far
as
tins
of
corned
beef
and
tongues
went
elizabeth
might
possibly
have
buried
them
in
her
garden
in
the
manner
of
a
dog
but
it
was
not
likely
that
a
hoarder
would
limit
herself
to
things
in
tins
no
there
was
a
cupboard
somewhere
ready
to
burst
with
strong
supporting
foods
diva
intentionally
arrived
a
full
quarter
of
an
hour
on
the
hither
side
of
punctuality
and
was
taken
by
withers
out
into
the
where
tea
was
laid
and
two
were
in
readiness
she
was
of
course
the
first
of
the
guests
and
the
moment
withers
withdrew
to
tell
her
mistress
that
she
had
come
diva
stealthily
glided
to
the
cupboard
from
in
front
of
which
the
had
been
removed
feeling
the
shrill
joy
of
some
romantic
treasure
hunter
she
found
the
catch
she
pressed
it
she
pulled
open
the
door
and
the
whole
of
the
damning
profusion
of
provisions
burst
upon
her
delighted
eyes
shelf
after
shelf
was
crowded
with
eatables
there
were
tins
of
corned
beef
and
tongues
that
she
knew
already
there
was
a
sack
of
flour
there
were
tubes
of
bath
oliver
biscuits
bottles
of
bovril
the
yield
of
a
thousand
condensed
swiss
cows
jars
of
prunes
all
these
were
in
the
front
row
flush
with
the
door
and
who
knew
to
what
depth
the
cupboard
extended
even
as
she
feasted
her
eyes
on
this
incredible
store
some
package
on
the
top
shelf
wavered
and
toppled
and
she
had
only
just
time
to
shut
the
door
again
in
order
to
prevent
it
falling
out
on
to
the
floor
but
this
displacement
prevented
the
door
from
wholly
closing
and
push
and
shove
as
diva
might
she
could
not
get
the
catch
to
click
home
and
the
only
result
of
her
energy
and
efforts
was
to
give
rise
to
a
muffled
explosion
from
within
just
precisely
as
if
something
made
of
cardboard
had
burst
that
mental
image
was
so
vivid
that
to
her
fevered
imagination
it
seemed
to
be
real
this
was
followed
by
certain
faint
taps
from
within
against
elegant
extracts
and
astronomy
diva
grew
very
red
in
the
face
and
said
drat
it
under
her
breath
she
did
not
dare
open
the
door
again
in
order
to
push
things
back
for
fear
of
an
uncontrollable
stream
of
things
pouring
out
some
nicely
balanced
equilibrium
had
clearly
been
upset
in
those
capacious
shelves
and
it
was
impossible
to
tell
without
looking
how
deep
and
how
extensive
the
disturbance
was
and
in
order
to
look
she
had
to
open
the
bookcase
again
luckily
the
pressure
against
the
door
was
not
sufficiently
heavy
to
cause
it
to
swing
wide
so
the
best
she
could
do
was
to
leave
it
just
ajar
with
temporary
quiescence
inside
simultaneously
she
heard
miss
mapp
step
and
had
no
more
than
time
to
trundle
at
the
utmost
speed
of
her
whirling
feet
across
to
the
window
where
she
stood
looking
out
and
appeared
quite
unconscious
of
her
hostess
entry
diva
darling
how
sweet
of
you
to
come
so
early
she
said
a
little
cosy
chat
before
the
others
arrive
diva
turned
round
much
startled
hullo
she
said
did
hear
you
got
janet
frock
you
see
what
makes
diva
face
so
red
thought
miss
mapp
so
i
see
darling
she
said
lovely
how
well
it
suits
you
dear
did
janet
mind
no
promised
her
a
new
frock
at
christmas
that
will
be
nice
for
janet
said
elizabeth
enthusiastically
shall
we
pop
into
the
garden
dear
till
my
guests
come
diva
was
glad
to
pop
into
the
garden
and
get
away
from
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
cupboard
for
though
she
had
planned
and
looked
forward
to
the
exposure
of
elizabeth
hoarding
she
had
not
meant
it
to
come
as
it
now
probably
would
in
crashes
of
tins
and
bursting
of
bovril
bottles
again
she
had
intended
to
have
opened
that
door
quite
casually
and
innocently
while
she
was
being
dummy
so
that
everyone
could
see
how
accidental
the
exposure
was
and
to
have
gone
poking
about
the
cupboard
in
elizabeth
absence
was
a
shade
too
professional
so
to
speak
for
the
usual
detective
work
of
tilling
but
the
fuse
was
set
now
sooner
or
later
the
explosion
must
come
she
wondered
as
they
went
out
to
commune
with
elizabeth
sweet
flowers
till
the
other
guests
arrived
how
great
a
torrent
would
be
let
loose
she
did
not
repent
her
exploration
far
from
it
but
her
pleasurable
anticipations
were
strongly
diluted
with
suspense
miss
mapp
had
found
such
difficulty
in
getting
eight
players
together
that
she
had
transgressed
her
principles
and
asked
poppit
as
well
as
isabel
and
they
with
diva
the
two
bartletts
and
the
major
and
the
captain
formed
the
party
the
moment
poppit
appeared
elizabeth
hated
her
more
than
ever
for
she
put
up
her
glasses
and
began
to
give
her
patronizing
advice
about
her
garden
which
she
had
not
been
allowed
to
see
before
you
have
quite
a
pretty
little
piece
of
garden
miss
mapp
she
said
though
to
be
sure
i
fancied
from
what
you
said
that
it
was
more
extensive
dear
me
your
roses
do
not
seem
to
be
doing
very
well
probably
they
are
old
plants
and
want
renewing
you
must
send
your
gardener
round
you
keep
a
gardener
and
i
will
let
you
have
a
dozen
vigorous
young
bushes
miss
mapp
licked
her
dry
lips
she
kept
a
kind
of
gardener
two
days
a
week
too
good
of
you
she
said
but
that
is
quite
sacred
dear
poppit
not
all
the
vigorous
young
bushes
in
the
world
would
tempt
me
it
my
border
some
dear
friend
gave
me
each
of
my
poppit
transferred
her
gaze
to
the
wistaria
that
grew
over
the
steps
up
to
the
some
of
the
dear
friends
she
thought
must
be
centenarians
your
wistaria
wants
pruning
sadly
she
said
your
gardener
does
not
understand
wistarias
that
corner
there
was
made
i
may
say
for
fuchsias
you
should
get
a
dozen
choice
fuchsias
miss
mapp
laughed
oh
you
must
excuse
me
she
said
with
a
glance
at
brocaded
silk
i
ca
bear
fuchsias
they
always
remind
me
of
women
ah
there
bartlett
how
de
do
padre
and
dear
evie
dear
evie
appeared
fascinated
by
diva
dress
such
beautiful
rosebuds
she
murmured
and
what
lovely
shade
of
purple
and
elizabeth
poppies
too
quite
a
pair
of
you
but
surely
this
morning
diva
did
i
see
your
good
janet
in
just
such
another
dress
and
i
thought
at
the
time
how
odd
it
was
that
if
you
saw
janet
this
morning
said
diva
quite
firmly
you
saw
her
in
her
print
dress
and
here
major
benjy
said
miss
mapp
who
had
made
her
slip
about
his
christian
name
yesterday
and
had
been
duly
entreated
to
continue
slipping
and
captain
puffin
well
that
is
nice
shall
we
go
into
my
little
garden
shed
dear
poppit
and
have
our
tea
major
flint
was
still
a
little
lame
for
his
golf
had
been
of
the
nature
of
gardening
and
he
hobbled
up
the
steps
behind
the
ladies
with
that
little
sailor
following
him
and
telling
the
padre
how
badly
and
yet
how
successfully
he
himself
had
played
pleasantest
room
in
tilling
i
always
say
miss
elizabeth
said
he
diverting
his
mind
from
a
mere
game
to
the
fairies
my
dear
little
room
said
miss
mapp
knowing
that
it
was
much
larger
than
anything
in
poppit
house
so
tiny
oh
not
a
little
room
said
poppit
encouragingly
much
the
same
proportions
on
a
very
small
scale
as
the
at
buckingham
palace
that
beautiful
exclaimed
miss
mapp
a
cup
of
tea
dear
poppit
none
of
that
naughty
fool
i
am
afraid
and
a
little
these
substantial
chocolate
cakes
soon
did
their
fell
work
of
producing
the
sense
of
surfeit
and
presently
elizabeth
guests
dropped
off
gorged
from
the
diva
fortunately
remembered
their
consistency
in
time
and
nearly
cleared
a
plate
of
jumbles
instead
which
the
hostess
had
hoped
would
form
a
pleasant
accompaniment
to
her
dessert
at
her
supper
this
evening
and
was
still
crashingly
engaged
on
them
when
the
general
drifting
movement
towards
the
two
set
in
poppit
with
her
glasses
up
followed
by
isabel
was
employed
in
making
a
tour
of
the
room
in
case
as
miss
mapp
had
already
determined
she
never
saw
it
again
examining
the
quality
of
the
carpet
the
curtains
the
with
the
air
of
a
doubtful
purchaser
and
quite
a
quantity
of
books
i
see
she
announced
as
she
came
opposite
the
fatal
cupboard
look
isabel
what
a
quantity
of
books
there
is
something
strange
about
them
though
i
do
not
believe
they
are
real
she
put
out
her
hand
and
pulled
at
the
back
of
one
of
the
volumes
of
elegant
extracts
the
door
swung
open
and
from
behind
it
came
a
noise
of
rattling
bumping
and
clattering
something
soft
and
heavy
thumped
on
to
the
floor
and
a
cloud
of
floury
dust
arose
a
bottle
of
bovril
embedded
itself
quietly
there
without
damage
and
a
tin
of
bath
oliver
biscuits
beat
a
fierce
tattoo
on
one
of
corned
beef
innumerable
dried
apricots
from
the
burst
package
flew
about
like
shrapnel
and
tapped
at
the
tins
a
jar
of
prunes
breaking
its
fall
on
the
flour
rolled
merrily
out
into
the
middle
of
the
floor
the
din
was
succeeded
by
complete
silence
the
padre
had
said
what
ho
i
fegs
during
the
tumult
but
his
voice
had
been
drowned
by
the
rattling
of
the
dried
apricots
the
member
of
the
order
of
the
british
empire
stepped
free
of
the
provisions
that
bumped
round
her
and
examined
them
through
her
glasses
diva
crammed
the
last
jumble
into
her
mouth
and
disposed
of
it
with
the
utmost
rapidity
the
birthday
of
her
life
had
come
as
miss
rossetti
said
dear
elizabeth
she
exclaimed
what
a
disaster
all
your
little
stores
in
case
of
the
coal
strike
let
me
help
to
pick
them
up
i
do
not
think
anything
is
broken
is
that
lucky
evie
hurried
to
the
spot
such
a
quantity
of
good
things
she
said
rapidly
under
her
breath
tinned
meats
and
bovril
and
prunes
and
ever
so
many
apricots
let
me
pick
them
all
up
and
with
a
little
dusting
why
what
a
big
cupboard
and
such
a
quantity
of
good
things
miss
mapp
had
certainly
struck
a
streak
of
embarrassments
what
with
naked
hopkins
and
janet
frock
and
this
unveiling
of
her
hoard
life
seemed
at
the
moment
really
to
consist
of
nothing
else
than
beastly
situations
how
on
earth
that
catch
of
the
door
had
come
undone
she
had
no
idea
but
much
as
she
would
have
liked
to
suspect
foul
play
from
somebody
she
was
bound
to
conclude
that
poppit
with
her
prying
hands
had
accidentally
pressed
it
it
was
like
diva
of
course
to
break
the
silence
with
odious
allusions
to
hoarding
and
bitterly
she
wished
that
she
had
not
started
the
topic
the
other
day
but
had
been
content
to
lay
in
her
stores
without
so
pointedly
affirming
that
she
was
doing
nothing
of
the
kind
but
this
was
no
time
for
vain
laments
and
restraining
a
natural
impulse
to
scratch
and
beat
poppit
she
exhibited
an
admirable
inventiveness
and
composure
though
she
knew
it
would
deceive
nobody
everybody
had
to
pretend
he
was
deceived
oh
my
poor
little
christmas
presents
for
your
needy
parishioners
padre
she
said
you
seen
them
before
you
were
meant
to
and
you
must
forget
all
about
them
and
so
little
harm
done
just
an
apricot
or
two
withers
will
pick
them
all
up
so
let
us
get
to
our
bridge
withers
entered
the
room
at
this
moment
to
clear
away
tea
and
miss
mapp
explained
it
all
over
again
all
our
little
christmas
presents
have
come
tumbling
out
withers
she
said
will
you
put
as
many
as
you
can
back
in
the
cupboard
and
take
the
rest
indoors
do
tread
on
the
apricots
it
was
difficult
to
avoid
doing
this
as
the
apricots
were
everywhere
and
their
colour
on
the
brown
carpet
was
wonderfully
protective
miss
mapp
herself
had
already
stepped
on
two
and
their
adhesive
stickiness
was
hard
to
get
rid
of
in
fact
for
the
next
few
minutes
the
was
in
strong
request
for
their
removal
from
the
soles
of
shoes
and
the
fender
was
littered
with
their
squashed
remains
the
party
generally
was
distinctly
thoughtful
as
it
sorted
itself
out
into
two
tables
for
every
single
member
of
it
was
trying
to
assimilate
the
amazing
proposition
that
miss
mapp
had
through
september
loaded
her
cupboard
with
christmas
presents
on
a
scale
that
staggered
belief
the
feat
required
thought
it
required
a
faith
so
childlike
as
to
verge
on
the
imbecile
conversation
during
deals
had
an
awkward
tendency
towards
discussion
of
the
coal
strike
as
often
as
it
drifted
there
the
subject
was
changed
very
abruptly
just
as
if
there
was
some
occult
reason
for
not
speaking
of
so
natural
a
topic
it
concerned
everybody
but
it
was
rightly
felt
to
concern
miss
mapp
the
most
chapter
v
it
was
the
major
turn
to
entertain
his
friend
and
by
nine
on
a
certain
squally
october
evening
he
and
puffin
were
seated
by
the
fire
in
the
while
the
rain
volleyed
at
the
windows
and
occasional
puffs
of
stinging
smoke
were
driven
down
the
chimney
by
the
gale
that
squealed
and
buffeted
round
the
house
puffin
by
way
of
keeping
up
the
comedy
of
roman
roads
had
brought
a
map
of
the
district
across
from
his
house
but
the
more
essential
part
of
his
equipment
for
this
studious
evening
was
a
bottle
of
whisky
originally
the
host
had
provided
whisky
for
himself
and
his
guest
at
these
pleasant
chats
but
there
were
undeniable
objections
to
this
plan
because
the
guest
always
proved
unusually
thirsty
which
tempted
his
host
to
keep
pace
with
him
while
if
they
both
drank
at
their
own
expense
the
causes
of
economy
and
abstemiousness
had
a
better
chance
also
while
the
major
took
his
drinks
short
and
strong
in
a
small
tumbler
puffin
enriched
his
with
lemons
and
sugar
in
a
large
one
so
that
nobody
could
really
tell
if
equality
as
well
as
fraternity
was
realized
but
if
each
brought
his
own
bottle
it
had
been
a
trying
day
and
the
major
was
very
lame
a
drenching
storm
had
come
up
during
their
golf
while
they
were
far
from
the
and
puffin
being
three
up
had
very
naturally
refused
to
accede
to
his
opponent
suggestion
to
call
the
match
off
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
be
paid
his
and
go
home
but
major
flint
remembering
that
puffin
game
usually
went
to
pieces
if
it
rained
had
rejected
this
proposal
with
the
scorn
that
it
deserved
there
had
been
other
disagreeable
incidents
as
well
his
driver
slippery
from
rain
had
flown
out
of
the
major
hands
on
the
twelfth
tee
and
had
shot
like
a
streamer
of
the
northern
morn
and
landed
in
a
pool
of
brackish
water
left
by
an
unusually
high
tide
the
ball
had
gone
into
another
pool
nearer
the
tee
the
ground
was
greasy
with
moisture
and
three
holes
further
on
puffin
had
fallen
flat
on
his
face
instead
of
lashing
his
fifth
shot
home
on
to
the
green
as
he
had
intended
they
had
given
each
other
stimies
and
each
had
holed
his
opponent
ball
by
mistake
they
had
wrangled
over
the
correct
procedure
if
you
lay
in
a
or
on
the
tram
lines
the
major
had
lost
a
new
ball
there
was
a
mushroom
on
one
of
the
greens
between
puffin
ball
and
the
hole
all
these
untoward
incidents
had
come
crowding
in
together
and
from
the
point
of
view
the
worst
of
them
all
had
been
the
collective
incident
that
puffin
so
far
from
being
put
off
by
the
rain
had
in
spite
of
mushroom
and
falling
down
played
with
a
steadiness
of
which
he
was
usually
quite
incapable
consequently
major
flint
was
lame
and
his
wound
troubled
him
while
puffin
in
spite
of
his
obvious
reasons
for
complacency
was
growing
irritated
with
his
companion
and
was
half
blinded
by
he
wiped
his
streaming
eyes
you
should
get
your
chimney
swept
he
observed
major
flint
had
put
his
handkerchief
over
his
face
to
keep
the
out
of
his
eyes
he
blew
it
off
with
a
loud
indignant
puff
oh
ah
indeed
he
said
puffin
was
rather
taken
aback
by
the
violence
of
these
interjections
they
dripped
with
angry
sarcasm
oh
well
no
offence
he
said
a
man
said
the
major
impersonally
makes
an
offensive
remark
and
says
offence
if
your
own
fireside
suits
you
better
than
mine
captain
puffin
all
i
can
say
is
that
you
at
liberty
to
enjoy
it
this
was
all
rather
irregular
they
had
indulged
in
a
good
stiff
breeze
this
afternoon
and
it
was
too
early
to
ruffle
the
calm
again
puffin
plucked
and
proffered
an
there
your
handkerchief
he
said
picking
it
up
now
let
have
one
of
our
comfortable
talks
hot
glass
of
grog
and
a
chat
over
the
fire
that
the
best
thing
after
such
a
wetting
as
we
got
this
afternoon
i
take
a
slice
of
lemon
if
you
be
so
good
as
to
give
it
me
and
a
lump
of
sugar
the
major
got
up
and
limped
to
his
cupboard
it
struck
him
precisely
at
that
moment
that
puffin
scored
considerably
over
lemons
and
sugar
because
he
was
supplied
with
them
gratis
every
other
night
whereas
he
himself
when
puffin
guest
took
nothing
off
his
host
but
hot
water
he
determined
to
ask
for
some
biscuits
anyhow
i
hardly
know
whether
there
a
lemon
left
he
grumbled
i
must
lay
in
a
store
of
lemons
as
for
sugar
puffin
chose
to
disregard
this
suggestion
amusing
incident
the
other
day
he
said
brightly
when
miss
cupboard
door
flew
open
the
old
lady
did
like
it
do
suppose
the
poor
of
the
parish
will
see
much
of
that
corned
beef
the
major
became
dignified
pardon
me
he
said
when
an
esteemed
friend
like
miss
elizabeth
tells
me
that
certain
provisions
are
destined
for
the
poor
of
the
parish
i
take
it
that
her
statement
is
correct
i
expect
others
of
my
friends
while
they
are
in
my
presence
to
do
the
same
i
have
the
honour
to
give
you
a
lemon
captain
puffin
and
a
slice
of
sugar
i
should
say
a
lump
of
sugar
pray
make
yourself
comfortable
this
dignified
and
lofty
mood
was
often
one
of
the
of
an
unsuccessful
game
of
golf
it
generally
yielded
quite
quickly
to
a
little
stimulant
puffin
filled
his
glass
from
the
bottle
and
the
kettle
while
his
friend
put
his
handkerchief
again
over
his
face
well
i
shall
just
have
my
grog
before
i
turn
in
he
observed
according
to
custom
are
you
going
to
join
me
major
presently
sir
said
the
major
puffin
knocked
out
the
consumed
cinders
in
his
pipe
against
the
edge
of
the
fender
major
flint
apparently
was
waiting
for
this
for
he
withdrew
his
handkerchief
and
closely
watched
the
process
a
minute
piece
of
ash
fell
from
puffin
pipe
on
to
the
hearthrug
and
he
jumped
to
his
feet
and
removed
it
very
carefully
with
the
shovel
i
have
your
permission
i
hope
he
said
witheringly
certainly
certainly
said
puffin
now
get
your
glass
major
feel
better
in
a
minute
or
two
major
flint
would
have
liked
to
have
kept
up
this
magnificent
attitude
but
the
smell
of
puffin
steaming
glass
beat
dignity
down
and
after
glaring
at
him
he
limped
back
to
the
cupboard
for
his
whisky
bottle
he
gave
a
lamentable
cry
when
he
beheld
it
but
i
got
that
bottle
in
only
the
day
before
yesterday
he
shouted
and
there
hardly
a
drink
left
in
it
well
you
did
yourself
pretty
well
last
night
said
puffin
those
small
glasses
of
yours
if
frequently
filled
up
empty
a
bottle
quicker
than
you
seem
to
realize
motives
of
policy
prevented
the
major
from
receiving
this
with
the
resentment
that
was
proper
to
it
and
his
face
cleared
he
would
get
quits
over
these
incessant
lemons
and
lumps
of
sugar
well
you
have
to
let
me
borrow
from
you
he
said
genially
as
he
poured
the
rest
of
the
contents
of
his
bottle
into
the
glass
ah
that
more
the
ticket
a
glass
of
whisky
a
day
keeps
the
doctor
away
the
prospect
of
sponging
on
puffin
was
most
exhilarating
and
he
put
his
large
slippered
feet
on
to
the
fender
yes
indeed
that
was
a
highly
amusing
incident
about
miss
cupboard
he
said
and
was
plaistow
down
on
her
like
a
knife
about
it
our
fair
friends
you
know
have
a
pretty
sharp
eye
for
each
other
little
failings
they
no
sooner
finished
one
squabble
than
they
begin
another
the
pert
little
fairies
they
ca
sit
and
enjoy
themselves
like
two
old
cronies
i
could
tell
you
of
and
feel
at
peace
with
all
the
world
he
finished
his
glass
at
a
gulp
and
seemed
much
surprised
to
find
it
empty
i
be
borrowing
a
drop
from
you
old
friend
he
said
help
yourself
major
said
puffin
with
a
keen
eye
as
to
how
much
he
took
very
obliging
of
you
i
feel
as
if
i
caught
a
bit
of
a
chill
this
afternoon
my
wound
be
careful
not
to
inflame
it
said
puffin
thank
ye
for
the
warning
it
this
beastly
climate
that
touches
it
up
a
winter
in
england
adds
years
on
to
a
man
life
unless
he
takes
care
of
himself
take
care
of
yourself
old
boy
have
some
more
sugar
before
long
the
major
hand
was
moving
slowly
and
instinctively
towards
puffin
whisky
bottle
again
i
reckon
that
big
glass
of
yours
puffin
he
said
holds
between
three
and
a
half
times
to
four
times
what
my
little
tumbler
holds
between
three
and
a
half
and
four
i
should
reckon
i
may
be
wrong
reckoning
the
water
in
i
daresay
you
not
far
out
major
said
he
and
according
to
my
estimate
you
mix
your
drink
somewhere
about
three
and
a
half
times
to
four
stronger
than
i
mix
mine
oh
come
come
said
the
major
three
and
a
half
to
four
times
should
say
repeated
puffin
you
wo
find
i
far
out
he
replenished
his
big
tumbler
and
instead
of
putting
the
bottle
back
on
the
table
absently
deposited
it
on
the
floor
on
the
far
side
of
his
chair
this
second
tumbler
usually
marked
the
most
convivial
period
of
the
evening
for
the
first
would
have
healed
whatever
unhappy
discords
had
marred
the
harmony
of
the
day
and
those
being
disposed
of
they
very
contentedly
talked
through
their
hats
about
past
prowesses
and
took
a
rosy
view
of
the
youth
and
energy
which
still
beat
in
their
vigorous
pulses
they
would
begin
perhaps
by
extolling
each
other
puffin
when
informed
that
his
friend
would
be
next
birthday
flatly
refused
without
offence
to
believe
it
and
indeed
he
was
quite
right
in
so
doing
because
the
major
was
in
reality
in
turn
major
flint
would
say
that
his
friend
had
the
figure
of
a
boy
of
twenty
which
caused
puffin
presently
to
feel
a
little
cramped
and
to
wander
negligently
in
front
of
the
big
between
the
windows
and
find
this
compliment
much
easier
to
swallow
than
the
major
age
for
the
next
they
would
chiefly
talk
about
themselves
in
a
pleasant
glow
of
major
flint
looking
at
the
various
implements
and
trophies
that
adorned
the
room
would
suggest
putting
a
sporting
challenge
in
the
my
word
puffin
he
would
say
i
half
a
mind
to
do
it
retired
major
of
his
majesty
forces
the
king
god
bless
him
and
he
took
a
substantial
sip
major
aged
challenges
any
gentleman
of
fifty
years
or
over
forty
said
puffin
sycophantically
as
he
thought
over
what
he
would
say
about
himself
when
the
old
man
had
finished
well
we
halve
it
we
say
to
please
you
puffin
let
see
where
had
i
got
to
major
challenges
any
gentleman
of
years
or
over
to
to
a
shooting
match
in
the
morning
followed
by
half
a
dozen
rounds
with
gloves
a
game
of
golf
eighteen
holes
in
the
afternoon
and
a
billiard
match
of
two
hundred
up
after
tea
ha
ha
i
should
feel
much
anxiety
as
to
the
result
my
confounded
leg
said
puffin
but
i
know
a
retired
captain
from
his
majesty
merchant
service
the
king
god
bless
him
aged
fifty
ho
ho
fifty
indeed
said
the
major
thinking
to
himself
that
a
little
man
like
puffin
might
be
as
old
as
an
egyptian
mummy
who
can
tell
the
age
of
a
kipper
not
a
day
less
major
captain
aged
fifty
who
take
on
all
comers
of
and
over
at
a
steeplechase

of

match
hopping

swinging

clubs
no
objection
gentlemen
then
carried
this
gaseous
mood
athletic
amatory
or
otherwise
the
amatory
ones
were
the
worst
usually
faded
slowly
like
the
light
from
the
setting
sun
or
an
exhausted
coal
in
the
grate
about
the
end
of
puffin
second
tumbler
and
the
gentlemen
after
that
were
usually
somnolent
but
occasionally
laid
the
foundation
for
some
disagreement
next
day
which
they
were
too
sleepy
to
go
into
now
major
flint
by
this
time
would
have
had
some
five
small
glasses
of
whisky
equivalent
as
he
bitterly
observed
to
one
in
days
and
as
he
measured
his
next
with
extreme
care
and
a
slightly
jerky
movement
would
announce
it
as
being
his
though
you
would
have
thought
he
had
plenty
of
on
already
puffin
correspondingly
took
a
thimbleful
more
the
thimble
apparently
belonging
to
some
housewife
of
anak
and
after
another
of
sudden
single
snores
and
startings
awake
again
of
pipes
frequently
lit
and
immediately
going
out
the
guest
still
perfectly
capable
of
coherent
speech
and
voluntary
motion
in
the
required
direction
would
stumble
across
the
dark
cobbles
to
his
house
and
doors
would
be
very
carefully
closed
for
fear
of
attracting
the
attention
of
the
lady
who
at
this
period
of
the
evening
was
usually
known
as
old
mappy
the
two
were
perfectly
well
aware
of
the
sympathetic
interest
that
old
mappy
took
in
all
that
concerned
them
and
that
she
had
an
eye
on
their
evening
séances
was
evidenced
by
the
frequency
with
which
the
corner
of
her
blind
in
the
window
of
the
was
raised
between
say
nine
and
eleven
at
night
they
had
often
watched
with
giggles
the
pencil
of
light
that
escaped
obscured
at
the
lower
end
by
the
outline
of
old
mappy
head
and
occasionally
drank
to
the
guardian
angel
guardian
angel
in
answer
to
direct
inquiries
had
been
told
by
major
benjy
during
the
last
month
that
he
worked
at
his
diaries
on
three
nights
in
the
week
and
went
to
bed
early
on
the
others
to
the
vast
improvement
of
his
mental
grasp
and
on
sunday
night
dear
major
benjy
asked
old
mappy
in
the
character
of
guardian
angel
i
do
think
you
knew
my
beloved
my
revered
mother
miss
elizabeth
said
major
benjy
i
spend
sunday
evening
as
well
well
the
very
next
sunday
evening
guardian
angel
had
heard
the
sound
of
singing
she
could
not
catch
the
words
and
only
fragments
of
the
tune
which
reminded
her
of
the
roseate
morn
hath
passed
away
brimming
with
emotion
she
sang
it
softly
to
herself
as
she
undressed
and
blamed
herself
very
much
for
ever
having
thought
that
dear
major
benjy
she
peeped
out
of
her
window
when
she
had
extinguished
her
light
but
fortunately
the
singing
had
ceased
however
the
epoch
of
puffin
second
big
tumbler
was
not
accompanied
by
harmonious
developments
major
benjy
was
determined
to
make
the
most
of
this
unique
opportunity
of
drinking
his
whisky
and
whether
puffin
put
the
bottle
on
the
further
side
of
him
or
under
his
chair
or
under
the
table
he
came
padding
round
in
his
slippers
and
standing
near
the
ambush
while
he
tried
to
interest
his
friend
in
tales
of
love
or
so
as
to
distract
his
attention
when
he
mistakenly
thought
he
had
done
so
he
hastily
refilled
his
glass
taking
unusually
stiff
doses
for
fear
of
not
getting
another
opportunity
and
altogether
omitting
to
ask
puffin
leave
for
these
maraudings
when
this
had
happened
four
or
five
times
puffin
acting
on
the
instinct
of
the
polar
bear
who
eats
her
babies
for
fear
that
anybody
else
should
get
them
surreptitiously
poured
the
rest
of
his
bottle
into
his
glass
and
filled
it
up
to
the
top
with
hot
water
making
a
mixture
of
extraordinary
power
soon
after
this
major
flint
came
rambling
round
the
table
again
he
was
not
sure
whether
puffin
had
put
the
bottle
by
his
chair
or
behind
the
and
was
quite
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
wherever
it
was
it
was
empty
amorous
reminiscences
had
been
the
accompaniment
to
puffin
second
tumbler
devilish
fine
woman
she
was
he
said
and
that
was
the
last
that
benjamin
flint
ever
saw
of
her
she
went
up
to
the
hills
next
morning
but
the
last
you
saw
of
her
just
now
was
on
the
deck
of
the
and
at
bombay
objected
puffin
or
did
she
go
up
to
the
hills
on
the
deck
of
the
and
wonderful
line
no
sir
said
benjamin
flint
that
was
helen
belle
it
was
belle
whom
i
saw
off
at
the
apollo
bunder
i
do
know
if
i
told
you
by
gad
i
kicked
the
bottle
over
no
idea
you
put
it
there
hope
the
cork
in
no
harm
if
it
is
said
puffin
beginning
on
his
third
most
fiery
glass
the
strength
of
it
rather
astonished
him
you
do
mean
to
say
it
empty
asked
major
flint
why
just
now
there
was
close
on
a
quarter
of
a
bottle
left
as
much
as
that
asked
puffin
glad
to
hear
it
not
a
drop
less
you
do
mean
to
say
well
if
you
can
drink
that
and
can
say
hippopotamus
afterwards
i
should
put
that
among
your
challenges
to
men
of
four
hundred
and
two
i
should
say
a
fine
thing
to
have
a
strong
head
though
if
i
drank
what
you
got
in
your
glass
i
should
be
tipsy
sir
puffin
laughed
in
his
irritating
falsetto
manner
good
thing
that
it
in
my
glass
then
and
not
your
glass
he
said
and
lem
me
tell
you
major
in
case
you
do
know
it
that
when
drunk
every
drop
of
this
and
sucked
the
lemon
you
have
had
far
more
out
of
my
bottle
this
evening
than
i
have
my
usual
twice
and
and
my
usual
as
you
say
is
what
my
ration
and
i
had
no
more
than
my
ration
eight
bells
and
a
pretty
good
ration
you
got
there
said
the
baffled
major
without
your
usual
twice
puffin
was
beginning
to
be
aware
of
that
as
he
swallowed
the
fiery
mixture
but
nothing
in
the
world
would
now
have
prevented
his
drinking
every
single
drop
of
it
it
was
clear
to
him
among
so
much
that
was
dim
owing
to
the
that
the
major
would
miss
a
good
many
drives
morning
and
whose
whisky
is
it
he
said
gulping
down
the
fiery
stuff
i
know
whose
it
going
to
be
said
the
other
and
i
know
whose
it
is
now
retorted
puffin
and
i
know
whose
whisky
it
is
that
filled
you
up
ti
as
a
drum
tight
as
a
drum
he
repeated
very
carefully
major
flint
was
conscious
of
an
unusual
activity
of
brain
and
when
he
spoke
of
a
sort
of
congestion
and
entanglement
of
words
it
pleased
him
to
think
that
he
had
drunk
so
much
of
somebody
else
whisky
but
he
felt
that
he
ought
to
be
angry
that
a
very
unmentionable
sor
of
thing
to
say
he
remarked
an
if
it
was
for
the
sacred
claims
of
hospitality
i
make
you
explain
just
what
you
mean
by
that
and
make
you
eat
your
words
pologize
in
fact
puffin
finished
his
glass
at
a
gulp
and
rose
to
his
feet
pologies
be
blowed
he
said
hittopopamus
and
were
you
addressing
that
to
me
asked
major
flint
with
deadly
calm
of
course
i
was
hippot
same
animal
as
before
pleasant
old
boy
and
as
for
the
lemon
you
lent
me
well
i
do
want
it
any
more
have
a
suck
at
it
ole
fellow
i
do
want
it
any
more
the
major
turned
purple
in
the
face
made
a
course
for
the
door
like
a
knight
move
at
chess
a
long
step
in
one
direction
and
a
short
one
at
right
angles
to
the
first
and
opened
it
the
door
thus
served
as
an
aperture
from
the
room
and
a
support
to
himself
he
spoke
no
word
of
any
sort
or
kind
his
silence
spoke
for
him
in
a
far
more
dignified
manner
than
he
could
have
managed
for
himself
captain
puffin
stood
for
a
moment
wreathed
in
smiles
and
fingering
the
slice
of
lemon
which
he
had
meant
playfully
to
throw
at
his
friend
but
his
smile
faded
and
by
some
sort
of
telepathic
perception
he
realized
how
much
more
decorous
it
was
to
say
or
better
to
indicate
in
a
dignified
manner
than
to
throw
lemons
about
he
walked
in
dots
and
dashes
like
a
morse
code
out
of
the
room
bestowing
a
naval
salute
on
the
major
as
he
passed
the
latter
returned
it
with
a
military
salute
and
a
suppressed
hiccup
not
a
word
passed
then
captain
puffin
found
his
hat
and
coat
without
much
difficulty
and
marched
out
of
the
house
slamming
the
door
behind
him
with
a
bang
that
echoed
down
the
street
and
made
miss
mapp
dream
about
a
thunderstorm
he
let
himself
into
his
own
house
and
bent
down
before
his
expired
fire
which
he
tried
to
blow
into
life
again
this
was
unsuccessful
and
he
breathed
in
a
quantity
of
he
sat
down
by
his
table
and
began
to
think
things
out
he
told
himself
that
he
was
not
drunk
at
all
but
that
he
had
taken
an
unusual
quantity
of
whisky
which
seemed
to
produce
much
the
same
effect
as
intoxication
allowing
for
that
he
was
conscious
that
he
was
extremely
angry
about
something
and
had
a
firm
idea
that
the
major
was
very
angry
too
but
all
been
about
he
vainly
asked
himself
all
been
about
he
was
roused
from
his
puzzling
over
this
unanswerable
conundrum
by
the
clink
of
the
flap
in
his
either
this
was
the
first
post
in
the
morning
in
which
case
it
was
much
later
than
he
thought
and
wonderfully
dark
still
or
it
was
the
last
post
at
night
in
which
case
it
was
much
earlier
than
he
thought
but
whichever
it
was
a
letter
had
been
slipped
into
his
box
and
he
brought
it
in
the
gum
on
the
envelope
was
still
wet
which
saved
trouble
in
opening
it
inside
was
a
half
sheet
containing
but
a
few
words
this
curt
epistle
ran
as
follows
sir
my
seconds
will
wait
on
you
in
the
course
of
morning
your
faithful
obedient
servant
benjamin
flint
captain
puffin
puffin
felt
as
calm
as
a
tropic
night
and
as
courageous
as
a
captain
somewhere
below
his
courage
and
his
calm
was
an
appalling
sense
of
misgiving
that
he
successfully
stifled
very
proper
he
said
aloud
qui
proper
insults
blood
seconds
wo
have
to
wait
a
second
better
get
a
good
sleep
he
went
up
to
his
room
fell
on
to
his
bed
and
instantly
began
to
snore
it
was
still
dark
when
he
awoke
but
the
square
of
his
window
was
visible
against
the
blackness
and
he
concluded
that
though
it
was
not
morning
yet
it
was
getting
on
for
morning
which
seemed
a
pity
as
he
turned
over
on
to
his
side
his
hand
came
in
contact
with
his
coat
instead
of
a
sheet
and
he
became
aware
that
he
had
all
his
clothes
on
then
as
with
a
crash
of
cymbals
and
the
beating
of
a
drum
in
his
brain
the
events
of
the
evening
before
leaped
into
reality
and
significance
in
a
few
hours
now
arrangements
would
have
been
made
for
a
deadly
encounter
his
anger
was
gone
his
whisky
was
gone
and
in
particular
his
courage
was
gone
he
expressed
all
this
compendiously
by
moaning
oh
god
he
struggled
to
a
sitting
position
and
lit
a
match
at
which
he
kindled
his
candle
he
looked
for
his
watch
beside
it
but
it
was
not
there
what
could
have
happened
then
he
remembered
that
it
was
in
its
accustomed
place
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
a
consultation
of
it
followed
by
holding
it
to
his
ear
only
revealed
the
fact
that
it
had
stopped
at
five
with
the
lucidity
that
was
growing
brighter
in
his
brain
he
concluded
that
this
stoppage
was
due
to
the
fact
that
he
had
not
wound
it
up
it
was
after
five
then
but
how
much
later
only
the
lords
of
time
knew
time
which
bordered
so
closely
on
eternity
he
felt
that
he
had
no
use
whatever
for
eternity
but
that
he
must
not
waste
time
just
now
that
was
far
more
precious
from
somewhere
in
the
cosmic
consciousness
there
came
to
him
a
thought
namely
that
the
first
train
to
london
started
at
six
in
the
morning
it
was
a
slow
train
but
it
got
there
and
in
any
case
it
went
away
from
tilling
he
did
not
trouble
to
consider
how
that
thought
came
to
him
the
important
point
was
that
it
had
come
coupled
with
that
was
the
knowledge
that
it
was
now
an
undiscoverable
number
of
minutes
after
five
there
was
a
gladstone
bag
under
his
bed
he
had
brought
it
back
from
the
only
yesterday
after
that
game
of
golf
which
had
been
so
full
of
disturbances
and
wet
stockings
but
which
now
wore
the
shimmering
security
of
peaceful
tranquil
days
long
past
how
little
so
he
thought
to
himself
as
he
began
swiftly
storing
shirts
ties
collars
and
other
useful
things
into
his
bag
had
he
appreciated
the
sweet
amenities
of
life
its
pleasant
conversations
and
companionships
its
topped
drives
and
mushrooms
and
incalculable
incidents
now
they
wore
a
glamour
and
a
preciousness
that
was
bound
up
with
life
itself
he
starved
for
more
of
them
not
knowing
while
they
were
his
how
sweet
they
were
the
house
was
not
yet
astir
when
ten
minutes
later
he
came
downstairs
with
his
bag
he
left
on
his
table
where
it
would
catch
the
eye
of
his
housemaid
a
sheet
of
paper
on
which
he
wrote
called
away
he
shuddered
as
he
traced
the
words
forward
no
letters
will
communicate
somehow
the
telegraphic
form
seemed
best
to
suit
the
urgency
of
the
situation
then
very
quietly
he
let
himself
out
of
his
house
he
could
not
help
casting
an
apprehensive
glance
at
the
windows
of
his
quondam
friend
and
prospective
murderer
to
his
horror
he
observed
that
there
was
a
light
behind
the
blind
of
the
major
bedroom
and
pictured
him
writing
to
his
seconds
he
wondered
who
the
seconds
were
going
to
be
or
polishing
up
his
pistols
all
the
rumours
and
hints
of
the
major
duels
and
affairs
of
honour
which
he
had
rather
scorned
before
not
wholly
believing
them
poured
like
a
red
torrent
into
his
mind
and
he
found
that
now
he
believed
them
with
a
passionate
sincerity
why
had
he
ever
attempted
and
with
such
small
success
to
call
this
a
hippopotamus
the
gale
of
the
night
before
had
abated
and
thick
chilly
rain
was
falling
from
a
sullen
sky
as
he
tiptoed
down
the
hill
once
round
the
corner
and
out
of
sight
of
the
duellist
house
he
broke
into
a
limping
run
which
was
accelerated
by
the
sound
of
an
from
the
station
it
was
mental
suspense
of
the
most
agonizing
kind
not
to
know
how
long
it
was
after
his
watch
had
stopped
that
he
had
awoke
and
the
sound
of
that
whistle
followed
by
several
short
puffs
of
steam
might
prove
to
be
the
bearing
away
to
london
on
business
or
pleasure
its
secure
and
careless
pilgrims
splashing
through
puddles
lopsidedly
weighted
by
his
bag
with
his
mackintosh
flapping
against
his
legs
he
gained
the
sanctuary
of
the
and
which
was
lighted
by
a
dim
expiring
lamp
and
scrutinized
the
face
of
the
murky
clock
with
a
sob
of
relief
he
saw
that
he
was
in
time
he
was
indeed
in
exceptionally
good
time
for
he
had
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
wait
an
anxious
internal
debate
followed
as
to
whether
or
not
he
should
take
a
return
ticket
optimism
that
is
to
say
the
hope
that
he
would
return
to
tilling
in
peace
and
safety
before
the
six
months
for
which
the
ticket
was
available
inclined
him
to
the
larger
expense
but
in
these
disquieting
circumstances
it
was
difficult
to
be
optimistic
and
he
purchased
a
single
for
on
such
a
morning
and
on
such
a
journey
he
must
get
what
comfort
he
could
from
padded
seats
and
coloured
photographs
of
places
of
interest
on
the
line
he
formed
no
vision
at
all
of
the
future
that
was
a
dark
well
into
which
it
was
dangerous
to
peer
there
was
no
bright
speck
in
its
unplumbable
depths
unless
major
flint
died
suddenly
without
revealing
the
challenge
he
had
sent
last
night
and
the
promptitude
with
which
its
recipient
had
disappeared
rather
than
face
his
pistol
he
could
not
frame
any
grouping
of
events
which
would
make
it
possible
for
him
to
come
back
to
tilling
again
for
he
would
either
have
to
fight
and
this
he
was
quite
determined
not
to
do
or
be
pointed
at
by
the
finger
of
scorn
as
the
man
who
had
refused
to
do
so
and
this
was
nearly
as
unthinkable
as
the
other
bitterly
he
blamed
himself
for
having
made
a
friend
and
worse
than
that
an
enemy
of
one
so
obsolete
and
as
to
bring
duelling
into
modern
life
as
far
as
he
could
be
glad
of
anything
he
was
glad
that
he
had
taken
a
single
not
a
return
ticket
he
turned
his
eyes
away
from
the
blackness
of
the
future
and
let
his
mind
dwell
on
the
hardly
less
murky
past
then
throwing
up
his
hands
he
buried
his
face
in
them
with
a
hollow
groan
by
some
miserable
forgetfulness
he
had
left
the
challenge
on
his
where
his
housemaid
would
undoubtedly
find
and
read
it
that
would
explain
his
absence
far
better
than
the
telegraphic
instructions
he
had
left
on
his
table
there
was
no
time
to
go
back
for
it
now
even
if
he
could
have
faced
the
risk
of
being
seen
by
the
major
and
in
an
hour
or
two
the
whole
story
via
withers
janet
would
be
all
over
tilling
it
was
no
use
then
thinking
of
the
future
nor
of
the
past
and
in
order
to
anchor
himself
to
the
world
at
all
and
preserve
his
sanity
he
had
to
confine
himself
to
the
present
the
minutes
long
though
each
tarried
were
slipping
away
and
provided
his
train
was
punctual
the
passage
of
five
more
of
these
laggards
would
see
him
safe
the
took
down
the
shutters
of
his
stall
a
porter
quenched
the
expiring
lamp
and
puffin
began
to
listen
for
the
rumble
of
the
approaching
train
it
stayed
three
minutes
here
if
up
to
time
it
would
be
in
before
a
couple
more
minutes
had
passed
there
came
from
the
outside
the
sound
of
heavy
footsteps
running
some
early
traveller
like
himself
was
afraid
of
missing
the
train
the
door
burst
open
and
streaming
with
rain
and
panting
for
breath
major
flint
stood
at
the
entry
puffin
looked
wildly
round
to
see
whether
he
could
escape
still
perhaps
unobserved
on
to
the
platform
but
it
was
too
late
for
their
eyes
met
in
that
instant
of
abject
terror
two
things
struck
puffin
one
was
that
the
major
looked
at
the
open
door
behind
him
as
if
meditating
retreat
the
second
that
he
carried
a
gladstone
bag
simultaneously
major
flint
spoke
if
indeed
that
reverberating
thunder
of
scornful
indignation
can
be
called
speech
ha
i
guessed
right
then
he
roared
i
guessed
sir
that
you
might
be
meditating
flight
and
i
in
fact
i
came
down
to
see
whether
you
were
running
away
i
was
right
you
are
a
coward
captain
puffin
but
relieve
your
mind
sir
major
flint
will
not
demean
himself
to
fight
with
a
coward
puffin
gave
one
long
sigh
of
relief
and
then
standing
in
front
of
his
own
gladstone
bag
in
order
to
conceal
it
burst
into
a
cackling
laugh
indeed
he
said
and
why
major
was
it
necessary
for
you
to
pack
a
gladstone
bag
in
order
to
stop
me
from
running
away
i
tell
you
what
has
happened
you
were
running
away
and
you
know
it
i
guessed
you
would
i
came
to
stop
you
you
you
quaking
runaway
your
wound
troubled
you
hey
did
want
another
hey
there
was
an
awful
pause
broken
by
the
entry
from
behind
the
major
of
the
outside
porter
panting
under
the
weight
of
a
large
portmanteau
you
had
to
take
your
portmanteau
too
observed
puffin
witheringly
in
order
to
stop
me
that
a
curious
way
of
stopping
me
you
a
coward
sir
but
go
home
you
safe
enough
this
will
be
a
fine
story
for
puffin
turned
from
him
in
scorn
still
concealing
his
own
bag
unfortunately
the
flap
of
his
coat
caught
it
precariously
perched
on
the
bench
and
it
bumped
to
the
ground
what
that
said
major
flint
they
stared
at
each
other
for
a
moment
and
then
simultaneously
burst
into
peals
of
laughter
the
train
rumbled
slowly
into
the
station
but
neither
took
the
least
notice
of
it
and
only
shook
their
heads
and
broke
out
again
when
the
urged
them
to
take
their
seats
the
only
thing
that
had
power
to
restore
captain
puffin
to
gravity
was
the
difficulty
of
getting
the
money
for
his
ticket
refunded
while
the
departure
of
the
train
with
his
portmanteau
in
it
did
the
same
for
the
major
the
events
of
that
night
and
morning
as
may
easily
be
imagined
soon
supplied
tilling
with
one
of
the
most
remarkable
conundrums
that
had
ever
been
forced
upon
its
notice
puffin
housemaid
during
his
absence
at
the
station
found
and
read
not
only
the
notice
intended
for
her
eyes
but
the
challenge
which
he
had
left
on
the
she
conceived
it
to
be
her
duty
to
take
it
down
to
gashly
his
cook
and
while
they
were
putting
the
bloodiest
construction
on
these
inscriptions
their
conference
was
interrupted
by
the
return
of
captain
puffin
in
the
highest
spirits
who
after
a
vain
search
for
the
challenge
was
quite
content
as
its
purport
was
no
longer
fraught
with
danger
and
death
to
suppose
that
he
had
torn
it
up
gashly
therefore
after
preparing
breakfast
at
this
unusually
early
hour
went
across
to
the
back
door
of
the
major
house
with
the
challenge
in
her
hand
to
borrow
a
nutmeg
grater
and
gleaned
the
information
that
dominic
employer
for
master
he
could
not
be
called
had
gone
off
in
a
great
hurry
to
the
station
early
that
morning
with
a
gladstone
bag
and
a
portmanteau
the
latter
of
which
had
been
seen
no
more
though
the
major
had
returned
so
gashly
produced
the
challenge
and
having
watched
miss
mapp
off
to
the
high
street
at
ten
dominic
and
gashly
went
together
to
her
house
to
see
if
withers
could
supply
anything
of
importance
or
if
not
a
nutmeg
grater
they
were
forced
to
be
content
with
the
grater
but
pored
over
the
challenge
with
withers
and
she
having
an
errand
to
diva
house
told
janet
who
without
further
ceremony
bounded
upstairs
to
tell
her
mistress
hardly
had
diva
heard
than
she
plunged
into
the
high
street
and
with
suitable
additions
told
miss
mapp
evie
irene
and
the
padre
under
promise
in
each
case
of
the
strictest
secrecy
ten
minutes
later
irene
had
asked
the
defenceless
hopkins
who
was
being
adam
again
what
he
knew
about
it
and
evie
with
her
gait
that
looked
so
rapid
and
was
so
deliberate
had
the
mortification
of
seeing
miss
mapp
outdistance
her
and
be
admitted
into
the
poppits
house
just
as
she
came
in
view
of
the
she
rightly
conjectured
that
after
the
affair
of
the
in
the
there
could
be
nothing
of
lesser
importance
than
the
duel
which
could
take
that
lady
through
those
abhorred
portals
finally
at
ten
minutes
past
eleven
major
flint
and
captain
puffin
were
seen
by
one
or
two
fortunate
people
the
morning
having
cleared
up
walking
together
to
the
tram
and
without
exception
everybody
knew
that
they
were
on
their
way
to
fight
their
duel
in
some
remote
hollow
of
the
miss
mapp
had
gone
straight
home
from
her
visit
to
the
poppits
just
about
eleven
and
stationed
herself
in
the
window
where
she
could
keep
an
eye
on
the
houses
of
the
duellists
in
her
anxiety
to
outstrip
evie
and
be
the
first
to
tell
the
poppits
she
had
not
waited
to
hear
that
they
had
both
come
back
and
knew
only
of
the
challenge
and
that
they
had
gone
to
the
station
she
had
already
formed
a
glorious
idea
of
her
own
as
to
what
the
history
of
the
duel
past
or
future
was
and
intoxicated
with
emotion
had
retired
from
the
wordy
fray
to
think
about
it
and
as
already
mentioned
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
two
houses
just
below
then
there
appeared
in
sight
the
padre
walking
swiftly
up
the
hill
and
she
had
barely
time
under
cover
of
the
curtain
to
regain
the
table
where
her
sweet
chrysanthemums
were
pining
for
water
when
withers
announced
him
he
wore
a
furrowed
brow
and
quite
forgot
to
speak
either
scotch
or
elizabethan
english
a
few
rapid
words
made
it
clear
that
they
both
had
heard
the
main
outlines
a
terrible
situation
said
the
padre
duelling
is
direct
contravention
of
all
christian
principles
and
i
believe
of
the
civil
law
the
discharge
of
a
pistol
in
unskilful
hands
may
lead
to
deplorable
results
and
major
flint
so
one
has
heard
is
an
experienced
duellist
that
of
course
makes
it
even
more
dangerous
it
was
at
this
identical
moment
that
major
flint
came
out
of
his
house
and
cheerily
to
puffin
miss
mapp
and
the
padre
deep
in
these
bloody
possibilities
neither
saw
nor
heard
them
they
passed
together
down
the
road
and
into
the
high
street
unconscious
that
their
very
look
and
action
was
being
more
commented
on
than
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
inside
the
miss
mapp
sighed
and
bent
her
eyes
on
her
chrysanthemums
quite
terrible
she
said
and
in
our
peaceful
tranquil
tilling
perhaps
the
duel
has
already
taken
place
and
and
they
missed
said
the
padre
they
were
both
seen
to
return
to
their
houses
early
this
morning
by
whom
asked
miss
mapp
jealously
she
had
not
heard
that
by
hopkins
said
he
hopkins
saw
them
both
return
i
should
trust
that
man
too
much
said
miss
mapp
hopkins
may
not
be
telling
the
truth
i
have
no
great
opinion
of
his
moral
standard
why
is
that
this
was
no
time
to
discuss
the
nudity
of
hopkins
and
miss
mapp
put
the
question
aside
that
does
not
matter
now
dear
padre
she
said
i
only
wish
i
thought
the
duel
had
taken
place
without
accident
but
major
benjy
i
mean
major
flint
portmanteau
has
not
come
back
to
his
house
of
that
sure
what
if
they
have
sent
it
away
to
some
place
where
they
are
unknown
full
of
pistols
and
things
possible
terribly
possible
said
the
padre
i
wish
i
could
see
my
duty
clear
i
should
not
hesitate
to
well
to
do
the
best
i
could
to
induce
them
to
abandon
this
murderous
project
and
what
do
you
imagine
was
the
root
of
the
quarrel
i
could
say
i
sure
said
miss
mapp
she
bent
her
head
over
the
chrysanthemums
your
distracting
sex
said
he
with
a
moment
gallantry
is
usually
the
cause
of
quarrel
i
noticed
that
they
both
seemed
to
admire
miss
irene
very
much
miss
mapp
raised
her
head
and
spoke
with
great
animation
dear
quaint
irene
i
sure
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it
she
said
with
perfect
truth
nothing
whatever
there
was
no
mistaking
the
sincerity
of
this
and
the
padre
tillingite
to
the
marrow
instantly
concluded
that
miss
mapp
knew
what
or
who
was
the
cause
of
all
this
unique
disturbance
and
as
she
bent
her
head
again
over
the
chrysanthemums
and
quite
distinctly
grew
in
the
face
he
felt
that
delicacy
prevented
his
inquiring
any
further
what
are
you
going
to
do
dear
padre
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
choking
with
emotion
whatever
you
decide
will
be
wise
and
christian
oh
these
violent
men
such
babies
too
the
padre
was
bursting
with
curiosity
but
since
his
delicacy
forbade
him
to
ask
any
of
the
questions
which
effervesced
like
sherbet
round
his
tongue
he
propounded
another
plan
i
think
my
duty
is
to
go
straight
to
the
major
he
said
who
seems
to
be
the
principal
in
the
affair
and
tell
him
that
i
know
all
and
guess
the
rest
he
added
nothing
that
i
have
said
declared
miss
mapp
in
great
confusion
must
have
anything
to
do
with
your
guesses
promise
me
that
padre
this
intimate
and
fruitful
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
sound
of
two
pairs
of
steps
just
outside
and
before
withers
had
had
time
to
say
plaistow
diva
burst
in
they
have
both
taken
the
tram
she
said
and
sank
into
the
nearest
chair
together
asked
miss
mapp
feeling
a
sudden
chill
of
disappointment
at
the
thought
of
a
duel
with
pistols
trailing
off
into
one
with
golf
clubs
yes
but
that
a
blind
panted
diva
they
were
talking
and
laughing
together
sheer
blind
duel
among
the
padre
it
is
your
duty
to
stop
it
said
miss
mapp
faintly
but
if
the
pistols
are
in
a
portmanteau
he
began
what
portmanteau
screamed
diva
who
had
heard
about
that
darling
i
tell
you
presently
said
miss
mapp
that
was
only
a
guess
of
mine
padre
but
there
no
time
to
lose
but
there
no
tram
to
catch
said
the
padre
it
has
gone
by
this
time
a
taxi
then
padre
oh
lose
no
time
are
you
coming
with
me
he
said
in
a
low
voice
your
presence
better
not
she
said
it
might
better
not
she
repeated
he
skipped
down
the
steps
and
was
observed
running
down
the
street
what
about
the
portmanteau
asked
the
greedy
diva
it
was
with
strong
misgivings
that
the
padre
started
on
his
christian
errand
and
had
not
the
sense
of
adventure
spiced
it
he
would
probably
have
returned
to
his
sermon
instead
which
was
christian
too
to
begin
with
there
was
the
ruinous
expense
of
taking
a
taxi
out
to
the
but
by
no
other
means
could
he
hope
to
arrive
in
time
to
avert
an
encounter
that
might
be
fatal
it
must
be
said
to
his
credit
that
though
this
was
an
errand
distinctly
due
to
his
position
as
the
spiritual
head
of
tilling
he
rejected
as
soon
as
it
occurred
to
him
the
idea
of
charging
the
hire
of
the
taxi
to
church
expenses
and
as
he
whirled
along
the
flat
road
across
the
marsh
the
thing
that
chiefly
buoyed
up
his
drooping
spirits
and
annealed
his
courage
was
the
romantic
nature
of
his
mission
he
no
longer
thanks
to
what
miss
mapp
had
so
clearly
refrained
from
saying
had
the
slightest
doubt
that
she
in
some
manner
that
scarcely
needed
conjecture
was
the
cause
of
the
duel
he
was
attempting
to
avert
for
years
it
had
been
a
matter
of
unwearied
and
confidential
discussion
as
to
whether
and
when
she
would
marry
either
major
flint
or
captain
puffin
and
it
was
superfluous
to
look
for
any
other
explanation
it
was
true
that
she
in
popular
parlance
was
getting
on
but
so
too
and
at
exactly
the
same
rate
were
the
representatives
of
the
united
services
and
the
sooner
that
two
out
of
the
three
of
them
got
on
permanently
the
better
no
doubt
some
crisis
had
arisen
and
inflamed
with
love
he
intended
to
confide
all
this
to
his
wife
on
his
return
on
his
return
the
unspoken
words
made
his
heart
sink
what
if
he
never
did
return
for
he
was
about
to
place
himself
in
a
position
of
no
common
danger
his
plan
was
to
drive
past
the
and
then
on
foot
after
discharging
the
taxi
to
strike
directly
into
the
line
of
tumbled
which
remote
and
undisturbed
and
full
of
large
convenient
hollows
stretched
along
the
coast
above
the
flat
beach
any
of
those
hollows
he
knew
might
prove
to
contain
the
duellists
in
the
very
act
of
firing
and
over
the
rim
of
each
he
had
to
pop
his
unprotected
head
he
if
in
time
would
have
to
separate
the
combatants
and
who
knew
whether
in
their
very
natural
chagrin
at
being
interrupted
they
might
not
turn
their
combined
pistols
on
him
first
and
settle
with
each
other
afterwards
one
murder
the
more
made
little
difference
to
desperate
men
other
shocks
less
deadly
but
extremely
unnerving
might
await
him
he
might
be
too
late
and
pop
his
head
over
the
edge
of
one
of
these
craters
only
to
discover
it
full
of
bleeding
if
not
mangled
bodies
or
there
might
be
only
one
mangled
body
and
the
other
unmangled
would
pursue
him
through
the
and
offer
him
life
at
the
price
of
silence
that
he
painfully
reflected
would
be
a
very
difficult
decision
to
make
luckily
captain
puffin
if
he
proved
to
be
the
survivor
was
lame
with
drawn
face
and
agonized
prayers
on
his
lips
he
began
a
systematic
search
of
the
often
his
nerve
nearly
failed
him
and
he
would
sink
panting
among
the
prickly
bents
before
he
dared
to
peer
into
the
hollow
up
the
sides
of
which
he
had
climbed
his
ears
shuddered
at
the
anticipation
of
hearing
from
near
at
hand
the
report
of
pistols
and
once
a
from
a
motor
passing
along
the
road
caused
him
to
leap
high
in
the
air
the
sides
of
these
dunes
were
steep
and
his
shoes
got
so
full
of
sand
that
from
time
to
time
in
spite
of
the
urgency
of
his
errand
he
was
forced
to
pause
in
order
to
empty
them
out
he
stumbled
in
rabbit
holes
he
caught
his
foot
and
once
his
trousers
in
strands
of
barbed
wire
the
remnant
of
coast
defences
in
the
great
war
he
crashed
among
potsherds
and
abandoned
kettles
but
with
a
thoroughness
that
did
equal
credit
to
his
wind
and
his
christian
spirit
he
searched
a
mile
of
perilous
dunes
from
end
to
end
and
peered
into
every
important
hollow
two
hours
later
jaded
and
torn
and
streaming
with
perspiration
he
came
in
the
vicinity
of
the
to
the
end
of
his
fruitless
search
he
staggered
round
the
corner
of
it
and
came
in
view
of
the
eighteenth
green
two
figures
were
occupying
it
and
one
of
these
was
in
the
act
of
putting
he
missed
then
he
saw
who
the
figures
were
it
was
captain
puffin
who
had
just
missed
his
putt
it
was
major
flint
who
now
expressed
elated
sympathy
bad
luck
old
boy
he
said
well
a
jolly
good
match
and
we
halve
it
why
there
the
padre
been
for
a
walk
join
us
in
a
round
this
afternoon
padre
blow
your
sermon
chapter
vi
the
same
delightful
prospect
at
the
end
of
the
high
street
over
the
marsh
which
had
witnessed
not
so
long
ago
the
final
encounter
in
the
wars
of
the
roses
and
the
subsequent
armistice
was
of
course
found
to
be
peculiarly
attractive
that
morning
to
those
who
knew
and
who
did
not
that
the
combatants
had
left
by
the
to
fight
among
the
and
that
the
intrepid
padre
had
rushed
after
them
in
a
taxi
the
padre
taxi
had
returned
empty
and
the
driver
seemed
to
know
nothing
whatever
about
anything
so
the
only
thing
for
everybody
to
do
was
to
put
off
lunch
and
wait
for
the
arrival
of
the
next
tram
which
occurred
at
in
consequence
all
the
doors
in
tilling
flew
open
like
those
of
cuckoo
clocks
at
ten
minutes
before
that
hour
and
this
pleasant
promenade
was
full
of
those
who
so
keenly
admired
autumn
tints
from
here
the
progress
of
the
tram
across
the
plain
was
in
full
view
so
too
was
the
station
across
the
river
which
was
the
terminus
of
the
line
and
expectation
when
the
little
train
approached
the
end
of
its
journey
was
so
tense
that
it
was
almost
disagreeable
a
couple
of
hours
had
elapsed
since
like
the
fishers
who
sailed
away
into
the
west
and
were
seen
no
more
till
the
corpses
lay
out
on
the
shining
sand
the
three
had
left
for
the
and
a
couple
of
hours
so
reasoned
the
cosmic
consciousness
of
tilling
gave
ample
time
for
a
duel
to
be
fought
if
the
padre
was
not
in
time
to
stop
it
and
for
him
to
stop
it
if
he
was
no
surgical
assistance
as
far
as
was
known
had
been
summoned
but
the
reason
for
that
might
easily
be
that
a
surgeon
skill
was
no
longer
alas
of
any
avail
for
one
if
not
both
of
the
combatants
but
if
such
was
the
case
it
was
nice
to
hope
that
the
padre
had
been
in
time
to
supply
spiritual
aid
to
anyone
whom
and
probes
were
powerless
to
succour
the
variety
of
which
the
approaching
tram
that
had
now
cut
off
steam
was
capable
of
providing
was
positively
bewildering
they
whirled
through
miss
mapp
head
like
the
autumn
leaves
which
she
admired
so
much
and
she
tried
in
vain
to
catch
them
all
and
when
caught
to
tick
them
off
on
her
fingers
each
moreover
furnished
diverse
and
legitimate
conclusions
for
instance
taking
the
thumb
i
if
nobody
of
the
slightest
importance
arrived
by
the
tram
that
might
be
because
nothing
had
happened
and
they
were
all
playing
golf
the
worst
had
happened
and
as
the
padre
had
feared
the
duellists
had
first
shot
him
and
then
each
other
the
next
worst
had
happened
and
the
padre
was
arranging
for
the
reverent
removal
of
the
corpse
of
i
major
benjy
or
ii
captain
puffin
or
those
of
iii
both
miss
mapp
let
go
of
her
thumb
and
lightly
touched
her
forefinger
ii
the
padre
might
arrive
alone
in
that
case
anything
or
nothing
might
have
happened
to
either
or
both
of
the
others
and
the
various
contingencies
hanging
on
this
arrival
were
so
numerous
that
there
was
not
time
to
sort
them
out
iii
the
padre
might
arrive
with
two
limping
figures
whom
he
assisted
here
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
captain
puffin
always
limped
and
the
major
occasionally
miss
mapp
did
not
forget
it
iv
the
padre
might
arrive
with
a
stretcher
query
whose
the
padre
might
arrive
with
two
stretchers
vi
three
stretchers
might
arrive
from
the
shining
sands
at
the
town
where
the
women
were
weeping
and
wringing
their
hands
in
that
case
miss
mapp
saw
herself
busily
employed
in
strengthening
poor
evie
who
now
was
running
about
like
a
mouse
from
group
to
group
picking
up
crumbs
of
cosmic
consciousness
miss
mapp
had
got
as
far
as
sixthly
though
she
was
aware
she
had
not
exhausted
the
possibilities
when
the
tram
stopped
she
furtively
took
out
from
her
pocket
she
had
focussed
them
before
she
put
them
in
the
through
which
she
had
watched
the
on
a
day
which
had
been
very
much
less
exciting
than
this
after
one
glance
she
put
them
back
again
feeling
vexed
and
disappointed
with
herself
for
the
which
they
had
so
unerringly
disclosed
was
one
that
had
not
entered
her
mind
at
all
in
that
moment
she
had
seen
that
out
of
the
tram
there
stepped
three
figures
and
no
stretcher
one
figure
it
is
true
limped
but
in
a
manner
so
natural
that
she
scorned
to
draw
any
deductions
from
that
halting
gait
they
proceeded
side
by
side
across
the
bridge
over
the
river
towards
the
town
it
is
no
use
denying
that
the
cosmic
consciousness
of
the
ladies
of
tilling
was
aware
of
a
disagreeable
to
so
many
hopes
and
fears
it
had
of
course
hoped
for
the
best
but
it
had
not
expected
that
the
best
would
be
quite
as
bad
as
this
the
best
to
put
it
frankly
would
have
been
a
bandaged
arm
or
something
of
that
kind
there
was
still
room
for
the
more
hardened
optimist
to
hope
that
something
of
some
sort
had
occurred
or
that
something
of
some
sort
had
been
averted
and
that
the
whole
affair
was
not
in
the
delicious
new
slang
phrase
of
the
padre
which
was
spreading
like
wildfire
through
tilling
a
pistols
might
have
been
innocuously
discharged
for
all
that
was
known
to
the
contrary
but
it
looked
bad
miss
mapp
was
the
first
to
recover
from
the
blow
and
took
diva
podgy
hand
diva
darling
she
said
i
feel
so
deeply
thankful
what
a
wonderful
and
beautiful
end
to
all
our
anxiety
there
was
a
subconscious
regret
with
regard
to
the
anxiety
the
anxiety
was
so
to
speak
a
dear
and
beloved
departed
and
diva
did
not
feel
so
sure
that
the
end
was
so
beautiful
and
wonderful
her
grandfather
miss
mapp
had
reason
to
know
had
been
a
butcher
and
probably
some
inherited
indifference
to
slaughter
lurked
in
her
tainted
blood
there
the
portmanteau
still
she
said
hopefully
pistols
in
the
portmanteau
your
idea
elizabeth
yes
dear
said
elizabeth
but
thank
god
i
must
have
been
very
wrong
about
the
portmanteau
the
told
me
that
he
brought
it
up
from
the
station
to
major
benjy
house
half
an
hour
ago
fancy
your
not
knowing
that
i
feel
sure
he
is
a
truthful
man
for
he
attends
the
padre
confirmation
class
if
there
had
been
pistols
in
it
major
benjy
and
captain
puffin
would
have
gone
away
too
i
am
quite
happy
about
that
now
it
went
away
and
it
has
come
back
that
all
about
the
portmanteau
she
paused
a
moment
but
what
does
it
contain
then
she
said
quickly
more
as
if
she
was
thinking
aloud
than
talking
to
diva
why
did
major
benjy
pack
it
and
send
it
to
the
station
this
morning
where
has
it
come
back
from
why
did
it
go
there
she
felt
that
she
was
saying
too
much
and
pressed
her
hand
to
her
head
has
all
this
happened
this
morning
she
said
what
a
full
morning
dear
lovely
autumn
leaves
i
shall
go
home
and
have
my
lunch
and
rest
au
reservoir
diva
miss
mapp
eternal
reservoirs
had
begun
to
get
on
diva
nerves
and
as
she
lingered
here
a
moment
more
a
great
idea
occurred
to
her
which
temporarily
banished
the
disappointment
about
the
duellists
elizabeth
as
all
the
world
knew
had
accumulated
a
great
reservoir
of
provisions
in
the
false
in
her
and
diva
determined
that
if
she
could
think
of
a
neat
phrase
the
very
next
time
elizabeth
said
to
her
she
would
work
in
an
allusion
to
elizabeth
own
reservoir
of
corned
beef
tongue
flour
bovril
dried
apricots
and
condensed
milk
she
would
have
to
frame
some
stinging
rejoinder
which
would
escape
her
when
next
elizabeth
used
that
stale
old
phrase
it
would
have
to
be
short
swift
and
spontaneous
and
therefore
required
careful
thought
it
would
be
good
to
bring
pop
into
it
also
your
reservoir
in
the
has
gone
again
i
hope
darling
was
the
first
draft
that
occurred
to
her
but
that
was
not
sufficiently
condensed
pop
goes
the
reservoir
on
the
analogy
of
the
weasel
was
better
and
better
than
either
was
there
not
some
sort
of
corn
called
which
americans
ate
have
you
any
in
your
reservoir
that
would
be
a
nasty
one
but
it
all
required
thinking
over
and
the
sight
of
the
padre
and
the
duellists
crossing
the
field
below
as
she
still
lingered
on
this
escarpment
of
the
hill
brought
the
duel
back
to
her
mind
it
would
have
been
considered
inquisitive
even
at
tilling
to
put
direct
questions
to
the
combatants
and
still
hoping
for
the
best
ask
them
who
won
or
something
of
that
sort
but
until
she
arrived
at
some
sort
of
information
the
excruciating
pangs
of
curiosity
that
must
be
endured
could
be
likened
only
to
some
acute
toothache
of
the
mind
with
no
dentist
to
stop
or
remove
the
source
of
the
trouble
elizabeth
had
already
succumbed
to
these
pangs
of
surmise
and
excitement
and
had
frankly
gone
home
to
rest
and
her
absence
the
fact
that
for
the
next
hour
or
two
she
could
not
except
by
some
extraordinary
feat
on
the
telephone
get
hold
of
anything
which
would
throw
light
on
the
whole
prodigious
situation
inflamed
diva
brain
to
the
highest
pitch
of
inventiveness
she
knew
that
she
was
elizabeth
inferior
in
point
of
reconstructive
imagination
and
the
present
moment
while
the
other
was
recuperating
her
energies
for
fresh
assaults
on
the
unknown
was
opportunity
the
one
person
who
might
be
presumed
to
know
more
than
anybody
else
was
the
padre
but
while
he
was
with
the
duellists
it
was
as
impossible
to
ask
him
what
had
happened
as
to
ask
the
duellists
who
had
won
she
must
while
miss
mapp
rested
get
hold
of
the
padre
without
the
duellists
even
as
athene
sprang
full
grown
and
panoplied
from
the
brain
of
zeus
so
from
diva
brain
there
sprang
her
plan
complete
she
even
resisted
the
temptation
to
go
on
admiring
autumn
tints
in
order
to
see
how
the
interesting
trio
looked
when
as
they
must
presently
do
they
passed
close
to
where
she
stood
and
hurried
home
pausing
only
to
purchase
pay
for
and
carry
away
with
her
from
the
provision
shop
a
large
and
crab
a
dainty
of
which
the
padre
was
inordinately
fond
ruinous
as
this
was
there
was
a
note
of
triumph
in
her
voice
when
on
arrival
she
called
loudly
for
janet
and
told
her
to
lay
another
place
at
the
luncheon
table
then
putting
a
strong
constraint
on
herself
she
waited
three
minutes
by
her
watch
in
order
to
give
the
padre
time
to
get
home
and
then
rang
him
up
and
reminded
him
that
he
had
promised
to
lunch
with
her
that
day
it
was
no
use
asking
him
to
lunch
in
such
a
way
that
he
might
refuse
she
employed
without
remorse
this
pitiless
the
engagement
was
short
and
brisk
he
pleaded
that
not
even
now
could
he
remember
even
having
been
asked
which
was
not
surprising
and
said
that
he
and
wee
wifie
had
begun
lunch
on
which
diva
unmasked
her
last
gun
and
told
him
that
she
had
ordered
a
crab
on
purpose
that
silenced
further
argument
and
he
said
that
he
and
wee
wifie
would
be
round
in
a
jiffy
and
rang
off
she
did
not
particularly
want
wee
wifie
but
there
was
enough
crab
diva
felt
that
she
had
never
laid
out
four
shillings
to
better
purpose
when
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
padre
gave
her
the
full
account
of
his
fruitless
search
among
the
so
deeply
impressive
was
his
sense
of
being
buoyed
up
to
that
incredibly
fatiguing
and
perilous
excursion
by
some
power
outside
himself
it
never
even
occurred
to
her
to
think
that
it
was
an
elaborate
practical
joke
on
the
part
of
the
power
outside
himself
to
spur
him
on
to
such
immense
exertions
to
no
purpose
at
all
he
had
only
got
as
far
as
this
over
his
interrupted
lunch
with
wee
wifie
and
though
she
too
was
in
agonized
suspense
as
to
what
happened
next
she
bore
the
repetition
with
great
equanimity
only
making
small
noises
of
impatience
which
nobody
heard
he
was
quite
forgetting
to
speak
either
scotch
or
elizabethan
english
so
obvious
was
the
absorption
of
his
hearers
without
these
added
aids
to
command
attention
and
then
i
came
round
the
corner
of
the
he
said
and
there
were
captain
puffin
and
the
major
finishing
their
match
on
the
eighteenth
hole
then
there
been
no
duel
at
all
said
diva
scraping
the
shell
of
the
crab
i
feel
sure
of
it
there
would
have
been
time
for
a
duel
and
a
round
of
golf
in
addition
to
the
impossibility
of
playing
golf
immediately
after
a
duel
no
nerves
could
stand
it
besides
i
asked
one
of
their
caddies
they
had
come
straight
from
the
tram
to
the
and
from
the
to
the
first
tee
they
had
not
been
alone
for
a
moment
said
diva
wondering
whether
this
had
been
worth
four
shillings
so
tame
was
the
conclusion
bartlett
gave
a
little
squeak
which
was
her
preliminary
to
speech
but
i
do
not
see
why
there
may
not
be
a
duel
yet
kenneth
she
said
because
they
did
not
fight
this
morning
excellent
crab
dear
diva
so
good
of
you
to
ask
us
there
no
reason
why
there
should
be
a
duel
this
afternoon
o
dear
me
and
cold
beef
as
well
i
shall
be
quite
stuffed
depend
upon
it
a
man
does
take
the
trouble
to
write
a
challenge
and
all
that
unless
he
means
business
the
padre
held
up
his
hand
he
felt
that
he
was
gradually
growing
to
be
the
hero
of
the
whole
affair
he
had
certainly
looked
over
the
edge
of
numberless
hollows
in
the
with
vivid
anticipations
of
having
a
bullet
whizz
by
him
on
each
separate
occasion
it
behoved
him
to
take
a
sublime
line
my
dear
he
said
business
is
hardly
a
word
to
apply
to
murder
that
within
the
last
hours
there
was
the
intention
of
fighting
a
duel
i
do
deny
but
something
has
decidedly
happened
which
has
averted
that
deplorable
calamity
peace
and
reconciliation
is
the
result
of
it
and
i
have
never
seen
two
men
so
unaffectedly
friendly
diva
got
up
and
whirled
round
the
table
to
get
the
port
for
the
padre
so
pleased
was
she
at
a
fresh
idea
coming
to
her
while
still
dear
elizabeth
was
resting
she
attributed
it
to
the
crab
we
all
been
on
a
false
scent
she
said
peace
and
reconciliation
happened
before
they
went
out
to
the
at
all
it
happened
at
the
station
they
met
at
the
station
you
know
it
is
proved
that
major
flint
went
there
major
would
send
portmanteau
off
alone
and
proved
that
captain
puffin
went
there
too
because
the
note
which
his
housemaid
found
on
the
table
before
she
saw
the
challenge
from
the
major
which
was
on
the
said
that
he
had
been
called
away
very
suddenly
no
they
both
went
to
catch
the
early
train
in
order
to
go
away
before
they
could
be
stopped
and
kill
each
other
but
why
did
they
go
what
happened
do
suppose
the
outside
porter
showed
them
how
wicked
they
were
or
no
stumps
me
almost
wish
elizabeth
was
here
she
good
at
guessing
the
padre
eye
brightened
reaction
after
the
perils
of
the
morning
crab
and
port
combined
to
make
a
man
of
him
eh
is
a
bonny
wee
drappie
of
port
whatever
mistress
plaistow
he
said
and
i
dinna
ken
that
ye
far
wrang
in
jaloosing
that
mistress
mapp
might
have
a
wee
bitty
word
to
say
aboot
it
a
she
had
the
mind
she
was
wrong
about
the
portmanteau
said
diva
confessed
she
was
wrong
hoots
i
not
mindin
the
bit
pochmantie
said
the
padre
what
else
does
she
know
asked
diva
feverishly
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
padre
had
the
fullest
attention
of
the
two
ladies
again
and
there
was
no
need
to
talk
scotch
any
more
begin
at
the
beginning
he
said
what
do
we
suppose
was
the
cause
of
the
quarrel
anything
said
diva
golf
he
shook
his
head
i
grant
you
words
may
pass
on
such
subjects
he
said
we
feel
keenly
i
know
about
in
tilling
though
we
shall
all
be
reconciled
over
that
next
sunday
when
real
time
god
time
as
i
am
venturing
to
call
it
in
my
sermon
comes
in
again
diva
had
to
bite
her
tongue
to
prevent
herself
bolting
off
on
this
new
scent
after
all
she
had
invested
in
crab
to
learn
about
duelling
not
about
well
she
said
we
may
have
had
words
on
that
subject
said
the
padre
booming
as
if
he
was
in
the
pulpit
already
but
we
should
i
hope
none
of
us
go
so
far
as
to
catch
the
earliest
train
with
pistols
in
defence
of
our
conviction
about
no
plaistow
if
you
are
right
and
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
your
view
in
thinking
that
they
both
went
to
such
lengths
as
to
be
in
time
for
the
early
train
in
order
to
fight
a
duel
undisturbed
you
must
look
for
a
more
solid
cause
than
that
diva
vainly
racked
her
brains
to
think
of
anything
more
worthy
of
the
highest
pitches
of
emotion
than
this
if
it
had
been
she
and
miss
mapp
who
had
been
embroiled
hoarding
and
dress
would
have
occurred
to
her
but
as
it
was
no
one
in
his
senses
could
dream
that
the
captain
and
the
major
were
sartorial
rivals
unless
they
had
quarrelled
over
the
question
as
to
which
of
them
wore
the
snuffiest
old
clothes
give
it
up
she
said
what
did
they
quarrel
about
passion
said
the
padre
in
those
full
deep
tones
in
which
next
sunday
he
would
allude
to
god
time
i
do
not
mean
anger
but
the
flame
that
exalts
man
to
heaven
or
or
does
exactly
the
opposite
but
whomever
for
asked
diva
quite
thrown
off
her
bearings
such
a
thing
had
never
occurred
to
her
for
as
far
as
she
was
aware
passion
except
in
the
sense
of
temper
did
not
exist
in
tilling
tilling
was
far
too
respectable
the
padre
considered
this
a
moment
i
am
betraying
no
confidence
he
said
because
no
one
has
confided
in
me
but
there
certainly
is
a
lady
in
this
town
i
do
not
allude
to
miss
irene
who
has
long
enjoyed
the
major
particular
esteem
may
not
some
deprecating
remark
wee
wifie
gave
a
much
louder
squeal
than
usual
he
means
poor
elizabeth
she
said
in
a
high
tremulous
voice
fancy
kenneth
diva
a
few
seconds
before
had
seen
no
reason
why
the
padre
should
drink
the
rest
of
her
port
and
was
now
in
the
act
of
drinking
some
of
that
unusual
beverage
herself
she
tried
to
swallow
it
but
it
was
too
late
and
next
moment
all
the
openings
in
her
face
were
fountains
of
that
delicious
wine
she
choked
and
she
gurgled
until
the
last
drop
had
left
her
windpipe
under
the
persuasion
of
pattings
on
the
back
from
the
others
and
then
she
gave
herself
up
to
loud
hoarse
laughter
through
which
there
shrilled
the
staccato
squeaks
of
wee
wifie
nothing
even
if
you
are
being
laughed
at
yourself
is
so
infectious
as
prolonged
laughter
and
the
padre
felt
himself
forced
to
join
it
when
one
of
them
got
a
little
better
a
relapse
ensued
by
reason
of
infection
from
the
others
and
it
was
not
till
exhaustion
set
in
that
this
triple
volcano
became
quiescent
again
only
fancy
said
evie
faintly
how
did
such
an
idea
get
into
your
head
kenneth
his
voice
shook
as
he
answered
well
we
were
all
a
little
worked
up
this
morning
he
said
the
idea
really
i
do
know
what
we
have
all
been
laughing
at
i
do
said
diva
go
on
about
the
idea
a
feminine
a
diabolical
inspiration
flared
within
wee
wifie
mind
elizabeth
suggested
it
herself
she
squealed
naturally
diva
could
not
help
remembering
that
she
had
found
miss
mapp
and
the
padre
in
earnest
conversation
together
when
she
forced
her
way
in
that
morning
with
the
news
that
the
duellists
had
left
by
the
tram
nobody
could
be
expected
to
have
so
short
a
memory
as
to
have
forgotten
just
now
she
forgave
elizabeth
for
anything
she
had
ever
done
that
might
have
to
be
reconsidered
afterwards
but
at
present
it
was
valid
enough
did
she
suggest
it
she
asked
the
padre
behaved
like
a
man
and
lied
like
ananias
most
emphatically
she
did
not
he
said
the
disappointment
would
have
been
severe
had
the
two
ladies
believed
this
confident
assertion
and
diva
pictured
a
delightful
interview
with
elizabeth
in
which
she
would
suddenly
tell
her
the
wild
surmise
the
padre
had
made
with
regard
to
the
cause
of
the
duel
and
see
how
she
looked
then
just
see
how
she
looked
then
that
was
all
and
guilt
would
fly
their
colours
miss
mapp
had
been
tempted
when
she
went
home
that
morning
after
enjoying
the
autumn
tints
to
ask
diva
to
lunch
with
her
but
remembered
in
time
that
she
had
told
her
cook
to
broach
one
of
the
tins
of
which
no
human
wizard
could
coax
into
the
again
if
he
shut
the
door
after
it
diva
would
have
been
sure
to
say
something
acid
and
allusive
to
remark
on
its
excellence
being
happily
not
wasted
on
the
poor
people
in
the
hospital
or
if
she
had
not
said
anything
at
all
about
it
her
silence
as
she
ate
a
great
deal
would
have
had
a
sharp
flavour
but
miss
mapp
would
have
liked
especially
when
she
went
to
take
her
rest
afterwards
on
the
big
sofa
in
the
to
have
had
somebody
to
talk
to
for
her
brain
seethed
with
conjectures
as
to
what
had
happened
was
happening
and
would
happen
and
discussion
was
the
best
method
of
simplifying
a
problem
of
narrowing
it
down
to
the
limits
of
probability
whereas
when
she
was
alone
now
with
her
own
imaginings
the
most
fantastic
of
them
seemed
plausible
she
had
however
handed
a
glorious
suggestion
to
the
padre
the
one
that
is
which
concerned
the
cause
of
the
duel
and
it
had
been
highly
satisfactory
to
observe
the
sympathy
and
respect
with
which
he
had
imbibed
it
she
had
too
been
so
discreet
about
it
she
had
not
come
within
measurable
distance
of
asserting
that
the
challenge
had
been
in
any
way
connected
with
her
she
had
only
been
very
emphatic
on
the
point
of
its
not
being
connected
with
poor
dear
irene
and
then
occupied
herself
with
her
sweet
flowers
that
had
been
sufficient
and
she
felt
in
her
bones
and
marrow
that
he
inferred
what
she
had
meant
him
to
infer
the
vulture
of
surmise
ceased
to
peck
at
her
for
a
few
moments
as
she
considered
this
and
followed
up
a
thread
of
gold
though
the
padre
would
surely
be
discreet
she
hoped
that
he
would
let
slip
to
dear
evie
in
the
course
of
the
vivid
conversation
they
would
be
sure
to
have
over
lunch
that
he
had
a
good
guess
as
to
the
cause
which
had
led
to
that
savage
challenge
upon
which
dear
evie
would
be
certain
to
ply
him
with
direct
squeaks
and
questions
and
when
she
got
hot
as
in
animal
vegetable
and
mineral
his
reticence
would
lead
her
to
make
a
good
guess
too
she
might
be
incredulous
but
there
the
idea
would
be
in
her
mind
while
if
she
felt
that
these
stirring
days
were
no
time
for
scepticism
she
could
hardly
fail
to
be
interested
and
touched
before
long
how
soon
miss
mapp
was
happily
not
aware
she
would
pop
in
to
see
diva
or
diva
would
pop
in
to
see
her
and
evie
observing
a
discretion
similar
to
that
of
the
padre
and
herself
would
soon
enable
dear
diva
to
make
a
good
guess
too
after
that
all
would
be
well
for
dear
diva
such
a
gossiping
darling
would
undoubtedly
tell
everybody
in
tilling
under
vows
of
secrecy
so
that
she
should
have
the
pleasure
of
telling
everybody
herself
just
what
her
good
guess
was
thus
very
presently
all
tilling
would
know
exactly
that
which
miss
mapp
had
not
said
to
the
dear
padre
namely
that
the
duel
which
had
been
fought
or
which
had
been
fought
was
all
about
her
and
the
best
of
it
was
that
though
everybody
knew
it
would
still
be
a
great
and
beautiful
secret
reposing
inviolably
in
every
breast
or
chest
as
the
case
might
be
she
had
no
anxiety
about
anybody
asking
direct
questions
of
the
duellists
for
if
duelling
for
years
past
had
been
a
subject
which
no
person
alluded
to
purposely
in
major
benjy
presence
how
much
more
now
after
this
critical
morning
would
that
subject
be
taboo
that
certainly
was
a
good
thing
for
the
duellists
if
closely
questioned
might
have
a
different
explanation
and
it
would
be
highly
inconvenient
to
have
two
contradictory
stories
going
about
but
as
it
was
nothing
could
be
nicer
the
whole
of
the
rest
of
tilling
under
promise
of
secrecy
would
know
and
even
if
under
further
promises
of
secrecy
they
communicated
their
secret
to
each
other
there
would
be
no
harm
done
after
this
excursion
into
elysian
fields
poor
miss
mapp
had
to
get
back
to
her
vulture
again
and
the
hour
rest
that
she
had
felt
was
due
to
herself
as
the
heroine
of
a
duel
became
a
period
of
extraordinary
cerebral
activity
puzzle
as
she
might
she
could
make
nothing
whatever
of
the
portmanteau
and
the
excursion
to
the
early
train
and
she
got
up
long
before
her
hour
was
over
since
she
found
that
the
more
she
thought
the
more
invincible
were
the
objections
to
any
conclusion
that
she
drowningly
grasped
at
whatever
attack
she
made
on
this
mystery
the
garrison
failed
to
march
out
and
surrender
but
kept
their
flag
flying
and
her
conjectures
were
woefully
blasted
by
the
forces
of
the
most
elementary
reasons
but
as
the
agony
of
suspense
if
no
fresh
topic
of
interest
intervened
would
be
frankly
unendurable
she
determined
to
concentrate
no
more
on
it
but
rather
to
commit
it
to
the
or
safe
of
her
subconscious
mind
from
which
at
will
when
she
felt
refreshed
and
reinvigorated
she
could
unlock
it
and
examine
it
again
the
whole
problem
was
more
superlatively
baffling
than
any
that
she
could
remember
having
encountered
in
all
these
inquisitive
years
just
as
the
subject
of
it
was
more
majestic
than
any
for
it
concerned
not
hoarding
nor
visits
of
the
prince
of
wales
nor
gowns
but
life
and
death
and
firing
of
deadly
pistols
and
should
love
be
added
to
this
august
list
certainly
not
by
her
though
tilling
might
do
what
it
liked
in
fact
tilling
always
did
she
walked
across
to
the
from
which
she
had
conducted
so
many
exciting
and
successful
investigations
but
the
view
seemed
as
stale
and
unprofitable
as
the
world
appeared
to
hamlet
even
though
poppit
at
that
moment
went
waddling
down
the
street
and
disappeared
round
the
corner
where
the
dentist
and
wyse
lived
with
a
sense
of
fatigue
miss
mapp
recalled
the
fact
that
she
had
seen
the
housemaid
cleaning
wyse
windows
yesterday
children
dear
was
it
yesterday
and
had
noted
her
industry
and
drawn
from
it
the
irresistible
conclusion
that
wyse
was
probably
expected
home
he
usually
came
back
about
and
let
slip
allusions
to
his
enjoyable
visits
in
scotland
and
his
so
he
was
pleased
to
express
it
with
his
sister
the
contessa
di
faraglione
at
capri
that
contessa
faraglione
was
rather
a
mythical
personage
to
miss
mapp
mind
she
was
certainly
not
in
a
mediæval
copy
of
who
who
which
was
the
only
accessible
handbook
in
matters
relating
to
noble
and
notable
personages
and
though
miss
mapp
would
not
have
taken
an
oath
that
she
did
not
exist
she
saw
no
strong
reason
for
supposing
that
she
did
certainly
she
had
never
been
to
tilling
which
was
strange
as
her
brother
lived
there
and
there
was
nothing
but
her
brother
allusions
to
certify
her
about
poppit
now
had
she
gone
to
see
wyse
or
had
she
gone
to
the
dentist
one
or
other
it
must
be
for
apart
from
them
that
particular
street
contained
nobody
who
counted
and
at
the
bottom
it
simply
conducted
you
out
into
the
uneventful
country
poppit
was
all
dressed
up
and
she
would
never
walk
in
the
country
in
such
a
costume
it
would
do
either
for
wyse
or
the
dentist
for
she
was
the
sort
of
woman
who
would
like
to
appear
grand
in
the
chair
so
that
he
might
be
shy
of
hurting
such
a
fine
lady
then
again
poppit
had
wonderful
teeth
almost
too
good
to
be
true
and
before
now
she
had
asked
who
lived
at
that
pretty
little
house
just
round
the
corner
as
if
to
show
that
she
did
know
where
the
dentist
lived
or
had
she
found
out
by
some
underhand
means
that
wyse
had
come
back
and
had
gone
to
call
on
him
and
give
him
the
first
news
of
the
duel
and
talk
to
him
about
scotland
very
likely
they
had
neither
of
them
been
to
scotland
at
all
they
conspired
to
say
that
they
had
been
to
scotland
and
stayed
at
keepers
lodges
more
likely
in
order
to
impress
tilling
with
their
magnificence
miss
mapp
sat
down
on
the
pipes
in
her
window
and
fell
into
one
of
her
reconstructive
musings
partly
if
wyse
was
back
it
was
well
just
to
run
over
his
record
partly
she
wanted
to
divert
her
mind
from
the
two
houses
just
below
that
of
major
benjy
on
the
one
side
and
that
of
captain
puffin
on
the
other
which
contained
the
key
to
the
great
insoluble
mystery
from
conjecture
as
to
which
she
wanted
to
obtain
relief
wyse
anyhow
would
serve
as
a
mild
opiate
for
she
had
never
lost
an
angry
interest
in
him
though
he
was
for
eight
months
of
the
year
or
thereabouts
in
tilling
he
was
never
for
a
single
hour
tilling
he
did
not
exactly
invest
himself
with
an
air
of
condescension
and
superiority
miss
mapp
did
him
that
justice
but
he
made
other
people
invest
him
with
it
so
that
it
came
to
the
same
thing
he
was
invested
he
did
not
drag
the
fact
of
his
sister
being
the
contessa
faraglione
into
conversation
but
if
talk
turned
on
sisters
and
he
was
asked
about
his
he
confessed
to
her
nobility
the
same
phenomenon
appeared
when
the
innocent
county
of
hampshire
was
mentioned
for
it
turned
out
that
he
knew
the
county
well
being
one
of
the
wyses
of
whitchurch
you
could
say
he
talked
about
it
but
he
made
other
people
talk
about
it
he
was
quite
impervious
to
satire
on
such
points
for
when
goaded
to
madness
miss
mapp
had
once
said
that
she
was
one
of
the
mapps
of
maidstone
he
had
merely
bowed
and
said
a
very
old
family
i
believe
and
when
the
conversation
branched
off
on
to
old
families
he
had
rather
pointedly
said
we
to
miss
mapp
so
poor
miss
mapp
was
sorry
she
had
been
satirical
but
for
some
reason
tilling
never
ceased
to
play
up
to
wyse
and
there
was
not
a
or
a
given
during
the
whole
period
of
his
residence
there
to
which
he
was
not
invited
hostesses
always
started
with
him
sending
him
round
a
note
with
to
await
answer
written
in
the
top
corner
since
he
had
clearly
stated
that
he
considered
the
telephone
an
undignified
instrument
only
fit
to
be
used
for
household
purposes
and
had
installed
his
in
the
kitchen
in
the
manner
of
the
wyses
of
whitchurch
that
alone
apart
from
notions
on
the
subject
made
telephoning
impossible
for
your
summons
was
usually
answered
by
his
cook
who
instantly
began
scolding
the
butcher
irrespective
and
disrespectful
of
whom
you
were
when
her
mistake
was
made
known
to
her
she
never
apologized
but
grudgingly
said
she
would
call
figgis
who
was
wyse
valet
figgis
always
took
a
long
time
in
coming
and
when
he
came
he
sneezed
or
did
something
disagreeable
and
said
yes
yes
what
is
it
in
a
very
testy
manner
after
explanations
he
would
consent
to
tell
his
master
which
took
another
long
time
and
even
then
wyse
did
not
come
himself
and
usually
refused
the
proffered
invitation
miss
mapp
had
tried
the
expedient
of
sending
withers
to
the
telephone
when
she
wanted
to
get
at
wyse
but
this
had
not
succeeded
for
withers
and
wyse
cook
quarrelled
so
violently
before
they
got
to
business
that
figgis
had
to
calm
the
cook
and
withers
to
complain
to
miss
mapp
this
in
brief
was
the
general
reason
why
tilling
sent
notes
to
wyse
as
for
chatting
through
the
telephone
which
was
the
main
use
of
telephones
the
thing
was
quite
out
of
the
question
miss
mapp
revived
a
little
as
she
made
this
piercing
analysis
of
wyse
and
the
warmth
of
the
central
heating
pipes
on
this
baffling
day
of
autumn
tints
was
comforting
no
one
could
say
that
wyse
was
not
punctilious
in
matters
of
social
etiquette
for
though
he
refused
of
the
invitations
which
were
showered
on
him
he
invariably
returned
the
compliment
by
an
autograph
note
hoping
that
he
might
have
the
pleasure
of
entertaining
you
at
lunch
on
thursday
next
for
he
always
gave
a
small
on
thursday
these
invitations
were
couched
in
wyse
said
that
he
had
met
a
mutual
friend
just
now
who
had
informed
him
that
you
were
in
residence
and
had
encouraged
him
to
hope
that
you
might
give
him
the
pleasure
of
your
company
etc
this
was
alluring
diction
it
presented
the
image
of
wyse
stepping
briskly
home
again
quite
heartened
up
by
this
chance
encounter
and
no
longer
the
prey
to
melancholy
at
the
thought
that
you
might
not
give
him
the
joy
he
was
encouraged
to
hope
these
polite
expressions
were
traced
in
a
neat
upright
hand
on
paper
which
when
he
had
just
come
back
from
italy
often
bore
a
coronet
on
the
top
with
villa
faraglione
capri
printed
on
the
top
corner
and
amelia
the
name
of
his
putative
sister
in
sprawling
gilt
on
the
left
the
whole
being
lightly
erased
of
course
he
was
quite
right
to
filch
a
few
sheets
but
it
threw
rather
a
lurid
light
on
his
character
that
they
should
be
such
grand
ones
last
year
only
in
a
fit
of
passion
at
wyse
having
refused
six
invitations
running
on
the
plea
of
other
engagements
miss
mapp
had
headed
a
movement
the
object
of
which
was
that
tilling
should
not
accept
any
of
wyse
invitations
unless
he
accepted
its
this
had
met
with
theoretical
sympathy
the
bartletts
diva
irene
the
poppits
had
all
agreed
rather
absently
that
it
would
be
a
very
proper
thing
to
do
but
the
very
next
thursday
they
had
all
including
the
originator
met
on
wyse
doorstep
for
a
and
the
movement
then
and
there
collapsed
though
they
all
protested
and
rebelled
against
such
a
notion
the
horrid
fact
remained
that
everybody
basked
in
effulgence
whenever
it
was
disposed
to
shed
itself
on
them
much
as
they
distrusted
the
information
they
dragged
out
of
him
they
adored
hearing
about
the
villa
faraglione
and
dressed
themselves
in
their
very
best
clothes
to
do
so
then
again
there
was
the
quality
of
the
lunch
itself
often
there
was
caviare
and
it
was
impossible
though
the
interrogator
who
asked
whether
it
came
from
twemlow
feared
the
worst
not
to
be
mildly
excited
to
know
when
wyse
referred
the
question
to
figgis
that
the
caviare
had
arrived
from
odessa
that
morning
the
haunch
of
came
from
perthshire
the
wine
on
the
subject
of
which
the
major
could
not
be
silent
and
which
often
made
him
extremely
talkative
was
from
my
vineyard
and
wyse
would
taste
it
with
the
air
of
a
connoisseur
and
say
not
quite
as
good
as
last
year
i
must
tell
the
cont
i
mean
my
sister
again
when
wyse
did
condescend
to
honour
a
or
a
tilling
writhed
under
the
consciousness
that
their
general
deportment
was
quite
different
from
that
which
they
ordinarily
practised
among
themselves
there
was
never
any
squabbling
at
wyse
table
and
such
squabbling
as
took
place
at
the
other
tables
was
conducted
in
low
hissings
and
whispers
so
that
wyse
should
not
hear
diva
never
haggled
over
her
gains
or
losses
when
he
was
there
the
padre
never
talked
scotch
or
elizabethan
english
evie
never
squeaked
like
a
mouse
no
shrill
recriminations
or
stately
sarcasms
took
place
between
partners
and
if
there
happened
to
be
a
little
disagreement
about
the
rules
wyse
decision
though
he
was
not
a
better
player
than
any
of
them
was
accepted
without
a
murmur
at
intervals
for
refreshment
in
the
same
way
diva
no
longer
filled
her
mouth
and
both
hands
with
there
was
no
scrambling
or
jostling
but
the
ladies
were
waited
on
by
the
gentlemen
who
then
refreshed
themselves
and
yet
wyse
in
no
way
asserted
himself
or
reduced
them
all
to
politeness
by
talking
about
the
polished
manners
of
italians
it
was
tilling
itself
which
chose
to
behave
in
this
unusual
manner
in
his
presence
sometimes
diva
might
forget
herself
for
a
moment
and
address
something
withering
to
her
partner
but
the
partner
never
replied
in
suitable
terms
and
diva
became
again
it
was
indeed
if
wyse
had
appeared
at
two
or
three
parties
rather
a
relief
not
to
find
him
at
the
next
and
breathe
freely
in
less
rarefied
air
but
whether
he
came
or
not
he
always
returned
the
invitation
by
one
to
a
thursday
and
thus
the
high
circles
of
tilling
met
every
week
at
his
house
miss
mapp
came
to
the
end
of
this
brief
retrospect
and
determined
when
once
it
was
proved
that
wyse
had
arrived
to
ask
him
to
tea
on
tuesday
that
would
mean
lunch
with
him
on
thursday
and
it
was
unnecessary
to
ask
anybody
else
unless
wyse
accepted
if
he
refused
there
would
be
no
but
after
the
events
of
the
last
hours
there
was
no
vividness
in
these
plans
and
reminiscences
and
her
eye
turned
to
the
profile
of
the
colonel
house
the
portmanteau
she
said
to
herself
no
she
must
take
her
mind
off
that
subject
she
would
go
for
a
walk
not
into
the
high
street
but
into
the
quiet
level
country
away
from
the
turmoil
of
passion
in
the
padre
sense
and
quarrels
in
her
own
where
she
could
cool
her
curiosity
and
her
soul
with
contemplation
of
the
swallows
and
the
white
butterflies
if
they
had
not
all
been
killed
by
the
touch
of
frost
last
night
and
the
autumn
tints
of
which
there
were
none
whatever
in
the
treeless
marsh
decidedly
the
shortest
way
out
of
the
town
was
that
which
led
past
wyse
house
but
before
leaving
the
she
practised
several
faces
at
the
opposite
the
door
which
should
suitably
express
if
she
met
anybody
to
whom
the
cause
of
the
challenge
was
likely
to
have
spread
the
bewildering
emotion
which
the
unwilling
cause
of
it
must
feel
there
must
be
a
wistful
wonder
there
must
be
a
certain
pride
there
must
be
the
remains
of
romantic
excitement
and
there
must
be
deep
womanly
anxiety
the
carriage
of
the
head
did
the
pride
the
eyes
did
the
wistful
wonder
and
the
romance
the
deep
womanly
anxiety
lurked
in
the
tremulous
smile
and
a
violent
rubbing
of
the
cheeks
produced
the
colour
of
excitement
in
answer
to
any
impertinent
questions
if
she
encountered
such
she
meant
to
give
an
absent
answer
as
if
she
had
not
understood
thus
equipped
she
set
forth
it
was
rather
disappointing
to
meet
nobody
but
as
she
passed
she
adjusted
the
chrysanthemums
she
wore
and
she
had
a
good
sight
of
his
profile
and
the
back
of
poppit
head
they
appeared
deep
in
conversation
and
miss
mapp
felt
that
the
tiresome
woman
was
probably
giving
him
a
very
incomplete
account
of
what
had
happened
she
returned
late
for
tea
and
broke
off
her
apologies
to
withers
for
being
such
a
trouble
because
she
saw
a
note
on
the
hall
table
there
was
a
coronet
on
the
back
of
the
envelope
and
it
was
addressed
in
the
neat
punctilious
hand
which
so
well
expressed
its
writer
villa
faraglione
capri
a
coronet
and
amelia
all
lightly
crossed
out
headed
the
page
and
she
read
dear
miss
mapp
it
is
such
a
pleasure
to
find
myself
in
our
little
tilling
again
and
our
mutual
friend
poppit
tells
me
you
are
in
residence
and
encourages
me
to
hope
that
i
may
induce
you
to
take
with
me
on
thursday
at
one
may
i
assure
you
with
all
delicacy
that
you
will
not
meet
here
anyone
whose
presence
could
cause
you
the
slightest
embarrassment
pray
excuse
this
hasty
note
figgis
will
wait
for
your
answer
if
you
are
in
yours
very
sincerely
algernon
wyse
had
not
withers
been
present
who
might
have
misconstrued
her
action
miss
mapp
would
have
kissed
the
note
failing
that
she
forgave
poppit
for
being
an
the
dear
woman
she
said
she
has
heard
and
has
told
him
of
course
she
need
not
ask
wyse
to
tea
now
chapter
vii
a
white
frost
on
three
nights
running
and
a
terrible
blackening
of
dahlias
whose
reputation
was
quite
gone
by
morning
would
probably
have
convinced
the
ladies
of
tilling
that
it
was
time
to
put
summer
clothing
in
camphor
and
winter
clothing
in
the
to
get
aired
even
if
the
padre
had
not
preached
that
remarkable
sermon
on
sunday
it
was
so
remarkable
that
miss
mapp
quite
forgot
to
note
grammatical
lapses
and
listened
entranced
the
text
was
he
made
summer
and
winter
and
after
repeating
the
words
very
impressively
so
that
there
might
be
no
mistake
about
the
origin
of
the
seasons
the
padre
began
to
talk
about
something
quite
different
namely
the
unhappy
divisions
which
exist
in
christian
communities
that
did
not
deceive
miss
mapp
for
a
moment
she
saw
precisely
what
he
was
getting
at
over
his
oratorical
fences
he
got
at
it
ever
since
had
been
inaugurated
a
few
years
before
it
had
been
one
of
the
chronic
dissensions
of
tilling
miss
mapp
diva
and
the
padre
flatly
refused
to
recognize
it
except
when
they
were
going
by
train
or
tram
when
principle
must
necessarily
go
to
the
wall
or
they
would
never
have
succeeded
in
getting
anywhere
while
miss
mapp
with
the
halo
of
martyrdom
round
her
head
had
once
arrived
at
a
party
an
hour
late
in
order
to
bear
witness
to
the
truth
and
in
consequence
had
got
only
dregs
of
tea
and
the
last
faint
strawberry
but
the
major
and
captain
puffin
used
the
tram
so
often
that
they
had
fallen
into
the
degrading
habit
of
dislocating
their
clocks
and
watches
on
the
first
of
may
and
dislocating
them
again
in
the
autumn
when
they
were
forced
into
uniformity
with
people
irene
was
flippant
on
the
subject
and
said
that
any
old
time
would
do
for
her
the
poppits
followed
convention
and
poppit
in
naming
the
hour
for
a
party
to
the
stalwarts
wrote
your
the
king
after
all
had
invited
her
to
be
decorated
at
a
particular
hour
and
what
was
good
enough
for
the
king
was
good
enough
for
poppit
the
sermon
was
quite
uncompromising
there
was
summer
and
winter
by
divine
ordinance
but
there
was
nothing
said
about
and
there
was
but
one
time
and
even
as
life
only
stained
the
white
radiance
of
eternity
as
the
gifted
but
alas
infidel
poet
remarked
so
too
did
time
but
ephemeral
as
time
was
noon
in
the
bible
clearly
meant
twelve
and
not
one
towards
even
meant
towards
even
and
not
the
middle
of
a
broiling
afternoon
the
sixth
hour
similarly
was
the
roman
way
of
saying
twelve
in
fact
was
god
time
and
though
there
was
nothing
wicked
far
from
it
in
adopting
strange
measures
yet
the
simple
the
childlike
clung
to
the
sacred
tradition
which
they
had
received
from
their
fathers
and
forefathers
at
their
mother
knee
then
followed
a
long
and
eloquent
passage
which
recapitulated
the
opening
about
unhappy
divisions
and
contained
several
phrases
regarding
the
lengths
to
which
such
divisions
might
go
which
were
strikingly
applicable
to
duelling
the
peroration
recapitulated
the
recapitulation
in
case
anyone
had
missed
it
and
the
coda
the
close
itself
in
the
full
noon
of
the
winter
sun
was
full
of
joy
at
the
healing
of
all
such
unhappy
divisions
and
now
the
rain
rattling
against
the
windows
drowned
the
doxology
the
doctrine
was
so
much
to
her
mind
that
miss
mapp
gave
a
shilling
to
the
offertory
instead
of
her
usual
sixpence
to
be
devoted
to
the
organist
and
choir
fund
the
padre
it
is
true
had
changed
the
hour
of
services
to
suit
the
heresy
of
the
majority
and
this
for
a
moment
made
her
hand
falter
but
the
hope
after
this
convincing
sermon
that
next
year
morning
service
would
be
at
the
hour
falsely
called
twelve
decided
her
not
to
withdraw
this
handsome
contribution
frosts
and
dead
dahlias
and
sermons
then
were
together
overwhelmingly
convincing
and
when
miss
mapp
went
out
on
monday
morning
to
do
her
shopping
she
wore
a
tweed
skirt
and
jacket
and
round
her
neck
a
long
woollen
scarf
to
mark
the
end
of
the
summer
poppit
alone
in
her
disgusting
ostentation
had
seemed
to
think
two
days
ago
that
it
was
cold
enough
for
furs
and
she
presented
a
truly
ridiculous
aspect
in
an
enormous
sable
coat
under
the
weight
of
which
she
could
hardly
stagger
and
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
when
she
stepped
out
of
the
royce
brisk
walking
and
large
woollen
scarves
saved
the
others
from
feeling
the
cold
and
from
being
unable
to
move
and
this
morning
the
high
street
was
dazzling
with
the
shifting
play
of
bright
colours
there
was
quite
a
group
of
scarves
at
the
corner
where
miss
mapp
street
debouched
into
the
high
street
irene
was
there
for
it
was
probably
too
cold
for
hopkins
that
morning
looking
quainter
than
ever
in
corduroys
and
mauve
stockings
with
an
immense
orange
scarf
bordered
with
pink
diva
was
there
wound
up
in
so
delicious
a
combination
of
and
cambridge
blue
that
miss
mapp
remembering
the
history
of
the
had
to
remind
herself
how
many
things
there
were
in
the
world
more
important
than
worsted
evie
was
there
in
vivid
green
with
a
purple
border
the
padre
had
a
knitted
magenta
waistcoat
and
poppit
that
great
sable
coat
which
almost
prevented
movement
they
were
all
talking
together
in
a
very
animated
manner
when
first
miss
mapp
came
in
sight
and
if
on
her
approach
conversation
seemed
to
wither
they
all
wore
besides
their
scarves
very
broad
pleasant
smiles
miss
mapp
had
a
smile
too
as
good
as
anybody
good
morning
all
you
dear
things
she
said
how
lovely
you
all
look
just
like
a
bed
of
delicious
flowers
such
nice
colours
my
poor
dahlias
are
all
dead
quaint
irene
uttered
a
hoarse
laugh
and
swinging
her
basket
went
quickly
away
she
often
did
abrupt
things
like
that
miss
mapp
turned
to
the
padre
dear
padre
what
a
delicious
sermon
she
said
so
glad
you
preached
it
such
a
warning
against
all
sorts
of
divisions
the
padre
had
to
compose
his
face
before
he
responded
to
these
compliments
i
reecht
glad
fair
lady
he
replied
that
my
bit
discourse
was
to
your
mind
come
wee
wifie
we
must
be
stepping
quite
suddenly
all
the
group
with
the
exception
of
poppit
melted
away
wee
wifie
gave
a
loud
squeal
as
if
to
say
something
but
her
husband
led
her
firmly
off
while
diva
with
rapidly
revolving
feet
sped
like
an
arrow
up
the
centre
of
the
high
street
such
a
lovely
morning
said
miss
mapp
to
poppit
when
there
was
no
one
else
to
talk
to
and
everyone
looks
so
pleased
and
happy
and
all
in
such
a
hurry
busy
as
bees
to
do
their
little
businesses
yes
poppit
began
to
move
quietly
away
with
the
deliberate
progression
necessitated
by
the
fur
coat
it
struck
miss
mapp
that
she
too
had
intended
to
take
part
in
the
general
breaking
up
of
the
group
but
had
merely
been
unable
to
get
under
way
as
fast
as
the
others
such
a
lovely
fur
coat
said
miss
mapp
sycophantically
such
beautiful
long
fur
and
what
is
the
news
this
morning
has
a
little
bird
been
whispering
anything
nothing
said
poppit
very
decidedly
and
having
now
sufficient
way
on
to
turn
she
went
up
the
street
down
which
miss
mapp
had
just
come
the
latter
was
thus
left
all
alone
with
her
shopping
basket
and
her
scarf
with
the
unerring
divination
which
was
the
natural
fruit
of
so
many
years
of
ceaseless
conjecture
she
instantly
suspected
the
worst
all
that
busy
conversation
which
her
appearance
had
interrupted
all
those
smiles
which
her
presence
had
seemed
but
to
render
broader
and
more
hilarious
certainly
concerned
her
they
could
not
still
have
been
talking
about
that
fatal
explosion
from
the
cupboard
in
the
because
the
duel
had
completely
silenced
the
last
echoes
of
that
and
she
instantly
put
her
finger
on
the
spot
somebody
had
been
gossiping
and
how
she
hated
gossip
somebody
had
given
voice
to
what
she
had
been
so
studiously
careful
not
to
say
until
that
moment
when
she
had
seen
the
rapid
breaking
up
of
the
group
of
her
friends
all
radiant
with
merriment
she
had
longed
to
be
aware
that
somebody
had
given
voice
to
it
and
that
everybody
under
seal
of
secrecy
knew
the
unique
queenliness
of
her
position
the
overwhelmingly
interesting
rôle
that
the
violent
passions
of
men
had
cast
her
for
she
had
not
believed
in
the
truth
of
it
herself
when
that
irresistible
seizure
of
coquetry
took
possession
of
her
as
she
bent
over
her
sweet
chrysanthemums
but
the
padre
respectful
reception
of
it
had
caused
her
to
hope
that
everybody
else
might
believe
in
it
the
character
of
the
smiles
however
that
wreathed
the
faces
of
her
friends
did
not
quite
seem
to
give
fruition
to
that
hope
there
were
smiles
and
smiles
respectful
smiles
sympathetic
smiles
envious
and
admiring
smiles
but
there
were
also
smiles
of
hilarious
and
mocking
incredulity
she
concluded
that
she
had
to
deal
with
the
latter
variety
something
thought
miss
mapp
as
she
stood
quite
alone
in
the
high
street
with
poppit
labouring
up
the
hill
and
diva
already
a
speck
in
the
distance
has
got
to
be
done
and
it
only
remained
to
settle
what
fury
with
the
dear
padre
for
having
hinted
precisely
what
she
meant
intended
and
designed
that
he
should
hint
was
perhaps
the
paramount
emotion
in
her
mind
fury
with
everybody
else
for
not
respectfully
believing
what
she
did
not
believe
herself
made
an
important
pendant
what
am
i
to
do
said
miss
mapp
aloud
and
had
to
explain
to
hopkins
who
had
all
his
clothes
on
that
she
had
not
spoken
to
him
then
she
caught
sight
again
of
poppit
sable
coat
hardly
further
off
than
it
had
been
when
first
this
thunderclap
of
an
intuition
deafened
her
and
still
reeling
from
the
shock
she
remembered
that
it
was
almost
certainly
poppit
who
was
the
cause
of
wyse
writing
her
that
exquisitely
delicate
note
with
regard
to
thursday
it
was
a
herculean
task
no
doubt
to
plug
up
all
the
fountains
of
talk
in
tilling
which
were
spouting
so
merrily
at
her
expense
but
a
beginning
must
be
made
before
she
could
arrive
at
the
end
a
short
scurry
of
nimble
steps
brought
her
up
to
the
sables
dear
poppit
she
said
if
you
are
walking
by
my
little
house
would
you
give
me
two
minutes
talk
and
so
stupid
of
me
to
forget
just
now
will
you
come
in
after
dinner
on
wednesday
for
a
little
rubber
the
days
are
closing
in
now
one
wants
to
make
the
most
of
the
daylight
and
i
think
it
is
time
to
begin
our
pleasant
little
winter
evenings
this
was
a
bribe
and
poppit
instantly
pocketed
it
with
the
effect
that
two
minutes
later
she
was
in
the
and
had
deposited
her
sable
coat
on
the
sofa
quite
shook
the
room
with
the
weight
of
it
said
miss
mapp
to
herself
while
she
arranged
her
plan
she
stood
looking
out
of
the
window
for
a
moment
writhing
with
humiliation
at
having
to
be
suppliant
to
the
member
of
the
british
empire
she
tried
to
remember
poppit
christian
name
and
was
even
prepared
to
use
that
but
this
crowning
ignominy
was
saved
her
as
she
could
not
recollect
it
such
an
annoying
thing
has
happened
she
said
though
the
words
seemed
to
blister
her
lips
and
you
dear
poppit
as
a
woman
of
the
world
can
advise
me
what
to
do
the
fact
is
that
somehow
or
other
and
i
ca
think
how
people
are
saying
that
the
duel
last
week
which
was
so
happily
averted
had
something
to
do
with
poor
little
me
so
absurd
but
you
know
what
gossips
we
have
in
our
dear
little
tilling
poppit
turned
on
her
a
fallen
and
disappointed
face
but
had
it
she
said
why
when
they
were
all
laughing
about
it
just
now
i
was
right
then
thought
miss
mapp
and
what
a
tactless
woman
i
said
i
believed
it
and
i
told
mr
wyse
miss
mapp
cursed
herself
for
her
frankness
but
she
could
obliterate
that
again
and
not
lose
a
rare
goodness
knew
how
rare
believer
i
am
in
such
a
difficult
position
she
said
i
think
i
ought
to
let
it
be
understood
that
there
is
no
truth
whatever
in
such
an
idea
however
much
truth
there
may
be
and
did
dear
wyse
believe
in
fact
i
know
he
must
have
for
he
wrote
me
oh
such
a
delicate
understanding
note
he
at
any
rate
takes
no
notice
of
all
that
is
being
said
and
hinted
miss
mapp
was
momentarily
conscious
that
she
meant
precisely
the
opposite
of
this
dear
wyse
take
notice
most
respectful
notice
of
all
that
was
being
said
and
hinted
thank
goodness
but
a
glance
at
poppit
fat
and
interested
face
showed
her
that
the
verbal
discrepancy
had
gone
unnoticed
and
that
the
luscious
flavour
of
romance
drowned
the
perception
of
anything
else
she
drew
a
handkerchief
out
and
buried
her
thoughtful
eyes
in
it
a
moment
rubbing
them
with
a
stealthy
motion
which
poppit
did
not
perceive
though
diva
would
have
my
lips
are
sealed
she
continued
opening
them
very
wide
and
i
can
say
nothing
except
that
i
want
this
rumour
to
be
contradicted
i
daresay
those
who
started
it
thought
it
was
true
but
true
or
false
i
must
say
nothing
i
have
always
led
a
very
quiet
life
in
my
little
house
with
my
sweet
flowers
for
my
companions
and
if
there
is
one
thing
more
than
another
that
i
dislike
it
is
that
my
private
affairs
should
be
made
matters
of
public
interest
i
do
no
harm
to
anybody
i
wish
everybody
well
and
nothing
nothing
will
induce
me
to
open
my
lips
upon
this
subject
i
will
not
cried
miss
mapp
say
a
word
to
defend
or
justify
myself
what
is
true
will
prevail
it
comes
in
the
bible
poppit
was
too
much
interested
in
what
she
said
to
mind
where
it
came
from
what
can
i
do
she
asked
contradict
dear
the
rumour
that
i
have
had
anything
to
do
with
the
terrible
thing
which
might
have
happened
last
week
say
on
my
authority
that
it
is
so
i
tremble
to
think
here
she
trembled
very
much
what
might
happen
if
the
report
reached
major
benjy
ears
and
he
found
out
who
had
started
it
we
must
have
no
more
duels
in
tilling
i
thought
i
should
never
survive
that
morning
i
will
go
and
tell
wyse
instantly
dear
said
poppit
that
would
never
do
true
believers
were
so
scarce
that
it
was
wicked
to
think
of
unsettling
their
faith
poor
mr
wyse
said
miss
mapp
with
a
magnanimous
smile
do
not
think
dear
of
troubling
him
with
these
little
trumpery
affairs
he
will
not
take
part
in
these
little
but
if
you
could
let
dear
diva
and
quaint
irene
and
sweet
evie
and
the
good
padre
know
that
i
laugh
at
all
such
nonsense
but
they
laugh
at
it
too
said
poppit
that
would
have
been
baffling
for
anyone
who
allowed
herself
to
be
baffled
but
that
was
not
miss
mapp
way
oh
that
bitter
laughter
she
said
it
hurt
me
to
hear
it
it
was
envious
laughter
dear
scoffing
bitter
laughter
i
heard
i
can
not
bear
that
the
dear
things
should
feel
like
that
tell
them
that
i
say
how
silly
they
are
to
believe
anything
of
the
sort
trust
me
i
am
right
about
it
i
wash
my
hands
of
such
nonsense
she
made
a
vivid
of
this
and
after
drying
them
on
an
imaginary
towel
let
a
sunny
smile
peep
out
the
eyes
which
she
had
rubbed
all
gone
she
said
and
we
will
have
a
dear
little
party
on
wednesday
to
show
we
are
all
friends
again
and
we
meet
for
lunch
at
dear
wyse
the
next
day
yes
he
will
get
tired
of
poor
little
me
if
he
sees
me
two
days
running
so
i
shall
not
ask
him
i
will
just
try
to
get
two
tables
together
and
nobody
shall
contradict
dear
diva
however
many
shillings
she
says
she
has
won
i
would
sooner
pay
them
all
myself
than
have
any
more
of
our
unhappy
divisions
you
will
have
talked
to
them
all
before
wednesday
will
you
not
dear
as
there
were
only
four
to
talk
to
poppit
thought
that
she
could
manage
it
and
spent
a
most
interesting
afternoon
for
two
years
now
she
had
tried
to
unfreeze
miss
mapp
who
when
all
was
said
and
done
was
the
centre
of
the
tilling
circle
and
who
if
any
attempt
was
made
to
shove
her
out
towards
the
circumference
always
gravitated
back
again
and
now
on
these
important
errands
she
was
miss
mapp
accredited
ambassador
and
all
the
terrible
business
of
the
opening
of
the
and
her
decoration
as
was
quite
forgiven
and
forgotten
there
would
be
so
much
walking
to
be
done
from
house
to
house
that
it
was
impossible
to
wear
her
sable
coat
unless
she
had
the
royce
to
take
her
about
the
effect
of
her
communications
would
have
surprised
anybody
who
did
not
know
tilling
a
less
subtle
society
when
assured
from
a
authoritative
source
that
a
report
which
it
had
entirely
refused
to
believe
was
false
would
have
prided
itself
on
its
perspicacity
and
said
that
it
had
laughed
at
such
an
idea
as
soon
as
ever
it
heard
it
as
being
palpably
look
at
miss
mapp
untrue
not
so
tilling
the
very
fact
that
by
the
mouth
of
her
ambassador
she
so
uncompromisingly
denied
it
was
precisely
why
tilling
began
to
wonder
if
there
was
not
something
in
it
and
from
wondering
if
there
was
not
something
in
it
surged
to
the
conclusion
that
there
certainly
was
diva
for
instance
the
moment
she
was
told
that
elizabeth
for
poppit
remembered
her
christian
name
perfectly
utterly
and
scornfully
denied
the
truth
of
the
report
became
intensely
thoughtful
say
there
nothing
in
it
she
observed
ca
understand
that
at
that
moment
diva
telephone
bell
rang
and
she
hurried
out
and
in
party
at
elizabeth
on
wednesday
she
said
she
saw
me
laughing
why
ask
me
poppit
was
full
of
her
sacred
mission
to
show
how
little
she
minds
your
laughing
she
suggested
as
if
it
was
true
then
seems
like
that
wants
us
to
think
it
not
true
she
was
very
earnest
about
it
said
the
ambassador
diva
got
up
and
tripped
over
the
outlying
skirts
of
poppit
fur
coat
as
she
went
to
ring
the
bell
sorry
she
said
take
it
off
and
have
a
chat
tea
coming
muffins
oh
no
thanks
said
poppit
i
so
many
calls
to
make
what
similar
calls
asked
diva
wait
ten
minutes
tea
janet
quickly
she
whirled
round
the
room
once
or
twice
all
corrugated
with
perplexity
beginning
telegraphic
sentences
and
not
finishing
them
says
it
not
true
laughs
at
notion
of
and
wyse
believes
the
padre
believed
after
all
the
major
little
captain
puffin
or
way
round
do
you
think
no
other
explanation
you
know
might
have
been
blood
she
buried
her
teeth
in
a
muffin
believe
there
something
in
it
she
summed
up
she
observed
her
guest
had
neither
tea
nor
muffin
help
yourself
she
said
want
to
worry
this
out
elizabeth
absolutely
denies
it
said
poppit
her
eyes
were
full
of
oh
anything
said
diva
rubbed
them
or
pepper
if
it
was
at
lunch
that
no
evidence
but
her
solemn
assertion
began
poppit
thinking
that
she
was
being
a
complete
failure
as
an
ambassador
she
was
carrying
no
conviction
at
all
saccharine
observed
diva
handing
her
a
small
phial
have
got
more
than
enough
sugar
for
myself
i
expect
elizabeth
got
plenty
well
never
mind
that
do
you
see
if
it
was
true
she
would
try
to
convince
us
that
it
was
seemed
absurd
on
the
face
of
it
but
if
she
tries
to
convince
us
that
it
is
true
well
something
in
it
there
was
the
gist
of
the
matter
and
poppit
proceeding
next
to
the
padre
house
found
more
muffins
and
incredulity
nobody
seemed
to
believe
elizabeth
assertion
that
there
was
nothing
in
it
evie
ran
round
the
room
with
excited
squeaks
the
padre
nodded
his
head
in
confirmation
of
the
opinion
which
when
he
first
delivered
it
had
been
received
with
mocking
incredulity
over
the
crab
quaint
irene
intent
on
hopkins
left
knee
in
the
absence
of
the
model
said
good
old
mapp
better
late
than
never
utter
incredulity
in
fact
was
the
ambassador
welcome
and
all
the
incredulous
were
going
to
elizabeth
party
on
wednesday
poppit
had
sent
the
royce
home
for
the
last
of
her
calls
and
staggered
up
the
hill
past
elizabeth
house
oddly
enough
just
as
she
passed
the
the
window
was
thrown
up
cup
of
tea
dear
susan
said
elizabeth
she
had
found
an
old
note
of
poppit
among
the
waste
paper
for
the
firing
of
the
kitchen
oven
fully
signed
just
two
minutes
talk
elizabeth
she
promptly
responded
the
news
that
nobody
in
tilling
believed
her
left
miss
mapp
more
than
calm
on
the
bright
side
of
calm
that
is
to
say
she
had
a
few
indulgent
phrases
that
tripped
readily
off
her
tongue
for
the
dear
things
who
hated
to
be
deprived
of
their
gossip
but
susan
certainly
did
not
receive
the
impression
that
this
playful
magnanimity
was
attained
with
an
effort
elizabeth
did
not
seem
really
to
mind
she
was
very
gay
then
skilfully
changing
the
subject
she
mourned
over
her
dead
dahlias
though
tilling
with
all
its
perspicacity
could
not
have
known
it
the
intuitive
reader
will
certainly
have
perceived
that
miss
mapp
party
for
wednesday
night
had
so
to
speak
further
irons
in
its
fire
it
had
originally
been
a
bribe
to
susan
poppit
in
order
to
induce
her
to
spread
broadcast
that
that
ridiculous
rumour
whoever
had
launched
it
had
been
promptly
denied
by
the
person
whom
it
most
immediately
concerned
it
served
a
second
purpose
in
showing
that
miss
mapp
was
too
high
above
the
mire
of
scandal
however
interesting
to
know
or
care
who
might
happen
to
be
wallowing
in
it
and
for
this
reason
she
asked
everybody
who
had
done
so
such
loftiness
of
soul
had
earned
her
an
amazing
bonus
for
it
had
induced
those
who
sat
in
the
seat
of
the
scoffers
before
to
come
hastily
off
and
join
the
thin
but
unwavering
ranks
of
the
true
believers
who
up
till
then
had
consisted
only
of
susan
and
wyse
frankly
so
blest
a
conclusion
had
never
occurred
to
miss
mapp
it
was
one
of
those
unexpected
rewards
that
fall
like
ripe
plums
into
the
lap
of
the
upright
by
denying
a
rumour
she
had
got
everybody
to
believe
it
and
when
on
wednesday
morning
she
went
out
to
get
the
chocolate
cakes
which
were
so
useful
in
allaying
the
appetites
of
guests
she
encountered
no
broken
conversations
and
gleeful
smiles
but
sidelong
glances
of
respectful
envy
but
what
tilling
did
not
and
could
not
know
was
that
this
the
first
of
the
autumn
was
destined
to
look
on
the
famous
teagown
of
as
designed
for
trout
no
doubt
other
ladies
would
have
hurried
up
their
new
gowns
or
at
least
have
camouflaged
their
old
ones
in
honour
of
the
annual
inauguration
of
evening
bridge
but
miss
mapp
had
no
misgivings
about
being
outshone
and
once
again
here
she
felt
that
luck
waited
on
merit
for
though
when
she
dressed
that
evening
she
found
she
had
not
anticipated
that
artificial
light
would
cast
a
somewhat
pale
though
not
ghastly
reflection
from
the
vibrant
blue
on
to
her
features
similar
in
effect
to
but
not
so
marked
as
the
light
that
shines
on
the
faces
of
those
who
lean
over
the
burning
brandy
and
raisins
of
snapdragon
this
interesting
pallor
seemed
very
aptly
to
bear
witness
to
all
that
she
had
gone
through
she
did
not
look
ill
she
was
satisfied
as
to
that
she
looked
gorgeous
and
a
little
wan
the
bridge
tables
were
not
set
out
in
the
which
entailed
a
scurry
over
damp
gravel
on
a
black
windy
night
but
in
the
little
square
parlour
above
her
where
withers
in
the
intervals
of
admitting
her
guests
was
laying
out
plates
of
sandwiches
and
the
chocolate
cakes
reinforced
when
the
interval
for
refreshments
came
with
hot
soup
whisky
and
syphons
and
a
jug
of
cup
prepared
according
to
an
ancestral
and
economical
recipe
which
miss
mapp
had
taken
a
great
deal
of
trouble
about
a
single
bottle
of
white
wine
with
suitable
additions
of
ginger
nutmeg
herbs
and
was
the
mother
of
a
gallon
of
a
drink
that
seemed
aflame
with
fiery
and
probably
spirituous
ingredients
guests
were
very
careful
how
they
partook
of
it
so
stimulating
it
seemed
miss
mapp
was
reading
a
book
on
gardening
upside
down
she
had
taken
it
up
rather
hurriedly
when
the
poppits
arrived
and
sprang
to
her
feet
with
a
pretty
cry
at
being
so
unexpectedly
but
delightfully
disturbed
susan
isabel
she
said
lovely
of
you
to
have
come
i
was
reading
about
flowers
making
plans
for
next
year
she
saw
the
four
eyes
riveted
to
her
dress
susan
looked
quite
shabby
in
comparison
and
isabel
did
not
look
anything
at
all
my
dear
too
lovely
said
poppit
slowly
miss
mapp
looked
brightly
about
as
if
wondering
what
was
too
lovely
at
last
she
guessed
oh
my
new
frock
she
said
do
you
like
it
dear
how
sweet
of
you
it
just
a
little
nothing
that
i
talked
over
with
that
nice
miss
greele
in
the
high
street
we
put
our
heads
together
and
invented
something
quite
cheap
and
simple
and
here
evie
and
the
dear
padre
so
kind
of
you
to
look
in
four
more
eyes
were
riveted
on
it
enticed
you
out
just
once
padre
went
on
miss
mapp
so
sweet
of
you
to
spare
an
evening
and
here
major
benjy
and
captain
puffin
well
that
is
nice
this
was
really
tremendous
of
miss
mapp
here
was
she
meeting
without
embarrassment
or
awkwardness
the
two
who
if
the
duel
had
not
been
averted
would
have
risked
their
very
lives
over
some
dispute
concerning
her
everybody
else
naturally
was
rather
taken
aback
for
the
moment
at
this
situation
so
deeply
dyed
in
the
dramatic
should
either
of
the
gladiators
have
heard
that
it
was
the
padre
who
undoubtedly
had
spread
the
rumour
concerning
their
hostess
poppit
was
afraid
that
even
his
cloth
might
not
protect
him
but
no
such
deplorable
calamity
occurred
and
only
four
more
eyes
were
riveted
to
the
upon
my
word
said
the
major
i
never
saw
anything
more
beautiful
than
that
gown
miss
elizabeth
straight
from
paris
eh
paris
in
every
line
of
it
oh
major
benjy
said
elizabeth
you
all
making
fun
of
me
and
my
simple
little
frock
i
getting
quite
shy
just
a
bit
of
old
stuff
that
i
had
but
so
nice
of
you
to
like
it
i
wonder
where
diva
is
we
shall
have
to
scold
her
for
being
late
ah
she
sha
be
scolded
diva
darl
the
endearing
word
froze
on
miss
mapp
lips
and
she
turned
deadly
white
in
the
doorway
in
equal
fury
and
dismay
stood
diva
dressed
in
precisely
the
same
staggeringly
lovely
costume
as
her
hostess
had
diva
and
miss
greele
put
their
heads
together
too
had
diva
got
a
bit
of
old
stuff
miss
mapp
pulled
herself
together
first
and
moistened
her
dry
lips
so
sweet
of
you
to
look
in
dear
she
said
shall
we
cut
naturally
the
malice
of
cards
decreed
that
miss
mapp
and
diva
should
sit
next
each
other
as
adversaries
at
the
same
table
and
the
combined
effect
of
two
lots
of
was
blinding
complete
silence
on
every
subject
connected
however
remotely
with
dress
was
of
course
the
only
line
for
correct
diplomacy
to
pursue
but
then
major
benjy
was
not
diplomatic
only
gallant
never
saw
such
stunning
gowns
eh
padre
he
said
dear
me
they
are
very
much
alike
too
are
they
pair
of
exquisite
sisters
it
would
be
hard
to
say
which
of
the
two
found
this
speech
the
more
provocative
of
rage
for
while
diva
was
four
years
younger
than
miss
mapp
miss
mapp
was
four
inches
taller
than
diva
she
cut
the
cards
to
her
sister
with
a
hand
that
trembled
so
much
that
she
had
to
do
it
again
and
diva
could
scarcely
deal
wyse
frankly
confessed
the
next
day
when
at
one
elizabeth
found
herself
the
first
arrival
at
his
house
that
he
had
been
very
i
have
given
myself
a
treat
dear
miss
mapp
he
said
i
have
asked
three
entrancing
ladies
to
share
my
humble
meal
with
me
and
have
provided
is
it
not
shocking
of
me
nobody
else
to
meet
them
your
pardon
dear
lady
for
my
greediness
now
this
was
admirably
done
elizabeth
knew
very
well
why
two
out
of
the
three
men
in
tilling
had
not
been
asked
very
gratifying
that
reason
was
and
with
the
true
refinement
of
which
wyse
was
so
amply
possessed
where
he
was
taking
all
the
blame
on
himself
and
putting
it
so
prettily
she
bestowed
her
widest
smile
on
him
oh
wyse
she
said
we
shall
all
quarrel
over
you
not
until
miss
mapp
had
spoken
did
she
perceive
how
subtle
her
words
were
they
seemed
to
bracket
herself
and
wyse
together
all
the
men
two
out
of
the
three
at
any
rate
had
been
quarrelling
over
her
and
now
there
seemed
a
very
fair
prospect
of
three
of
the
women
quarreling
over
wyse
without
being
in
the
least
effeminate
wyse
this
morning
looked
rather
like
a
modern
troubadour
he
had
a
velveteen
coat
on
a
soft
fluffy
mushy
tie
which
looked
as
if
made
of
shirley
poppies
very
neat
knickerbockers
brown
stockings
with
blobs
like
the
fruit
of
plane
trees
dependent
from
elaborate
tops
and
shoes
with
a
cascade
of
leather
frilling
covering
the
laces
he
might
almost
equally
well
be
about
to
play
golf
over
on
the
lawn
as
the
guitar
he
made
a
gesture
of
polished
polite
dissent
not
contradicting
yet
hardly
accepting
this
tribute
remitting
it
perhaps
just
as
the
king
when
he
enters
the
city
of
london
touches
the
sword
of
the
lord
mayor
and
tells
him
to
keep
it
so
pleasant
to
be
in
tilling
again
he
said
we
shall
have
a
cosy
busy
winter
i
hope
you
i
know
miss
mapp
are
always
busy
the
day
is
never
long
enough
for
me
said
elizabeth
enthusiastically
what
with
my
household
duties
in
the
morning
and
my
garden
and
our
pleasant
little
gatherings
it
is
always
too
soon
i
want
to
read
a
great
deal
this
winter
too
diva
at
the
sight
of
whom
elizabeth
had
to
make
a
strong
effort
of
here
came
in
together
with
poppit
and
the
party
was
complete
elizabeth
would
have
been
willing
to
bet
that
in
spite
of
the
warmness
of
the
morning
susan
would
have
on
her
sable
coat
and
though
technically
she
would
have
lost
she
more
than
won
morally
for
wyse
repeated
speeches
about
his
greediness
were
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
when
she
discovered
that
she
had
left
her
handkerchief
in
the
pocket
of
her
sable
coat
which
she
had
put
over
the
back
of
a
conspicuous
chair
in
the
hall
figgis
however
came
in
at
the
moment
to
say
that
lunch
was
ready
and
she
delayed
them
all
very
much
by
a
long
ineffectual
search
for
it
during
which
figgis
with
a
visible
effort
held
up
the
sable
coat
so
that
it
was
displayed
to
the
utmost
advantage
and
then
only
fancy
susan
discovered
that
it
was
in
her
sable
muff
all
the
time
all
three
ladies
were
on
tenterhooks
of
anxiety
as
to
who
was
to
be
placed
on
wyse
right
who
on
his
left
and
who
would
be
given
only
the
place
between
two
other
women
but
his
tact
was
equal
to
anything
miss
mapp
he
said
will
you
honour
me
by
taking
the
head
of
my
table
and
be
hostess
for
me
only
i
must
have
that
vase
of
flowers
removed
figgis
i
can
look
at
my
flowers
when
miss
mapp
is
not
here
now
what
have
we
got
for
breakfast
lunch
i
should
say
the
macaroni
which
wyse
had
brought
back
with
him
from
naples
naturally
led
on
to
italian
subjects
and
the
general
scepticism
about
the
contessa
di
faraglione
had
a
staggering
blow
dealt
it
my
sister
began
wyse
and
by
a
swift
sucking
motion
diva
drew
into
her
mouth
several
serpents
of
dependent
macaroni
in
order
to
be
able
to
listen
better
without
this
agitating
distraction
my
sister
i
hope
will
come
to
england
this
winter
and
spend
several
weeks
with
me
sensation
and
the
count
asked
diva
having
swallowed
the
serpents
i
fear
not
cecco
francesco
you
know
is
a
great
amelia
is
looking
forward
very
much
to
seeing
tilling
i
shall
insist
on
her
making
a
long
stay
here
before
she
visits
our
relations
at
whitchurch
elizabeth
found
herself
reserving
judgment
she
would
believe
in
the
contessa
faraglione
no
one
more
firmly
when
she
saw
her
and
had
reasonable
proofs
of
her
identity
delightful
she
said
abandoning
with
regret
the
fruitless
pursuit
with
a
fork
of
the
few
last
serpents
that
writhed
on
her
plate
what
an
addition
to
our
society
we
shall
all
do
our
best
to
spoil
her
wyse
when
do
you
expect
her
early
in
december
you
must
be
very
kind
to
her
dear
ladies
she
is
an
insatiable
she
has
heard
much
of
the
great
players
she
will
meet
here
that
decided
poppit
she
would
join
the
correspondence
class
conducted
by
little
slam
in
cosy
corner
little
slam
for
the
sum
of
two
guineas
payable
in
advance
engaged
to
make
players
of
anyone
with
normal
intelligence
diva
mind
flew
off
to
the
subject
of
dress
and
the
thought
of
the
awful
tragedy
concerning
the
of
combined
with
the
endive
salad
gave
a
wry
twist
to
her
mouth
for
a
moment
i
as
you
know
continued
wyse
am
no
hand
at
bridge
oh
wyse
you
play
beautifully
interpolated
elizabeth
too
flattering
of
you
miss
mapp
but
amelia
and
cecco
do
not
agree
with
you
i
am
never
allowed
to
play
when
i
am
at
the
villa
faraglione
unless
a
table
can
not
be
made
up
without
me
but
i
shall
look
forward
to
seeing
many
games
the
quails
and
the
figs
had
come
from
capri
and
miss
mapp
greedily
devouring
each
in
turn
was
so
much
incensed
by
the
information
that
she
had
elicited
about
them
that
though
she
joined
in
the
general
lobgesang
she
was
tempted
to
inquire
whether
the
ice
had
not
been
brought
from
the
south
pole
by
some
antarctic
expedition
her
mind
was
not
like
poor
diva
taken
up
with
obstinate
questionings
about
the
for
she
had
already
determined
what
she
was
going
to
do
about
it
naturally
it
was
impossible
to
contemplate
fresh
encounters
like
that
of
last
night
but
another
gown
the
colour
of
trout
toilet
for
the
second
evening
of
the
duke
of
hampshire
visit
as
vogue
informed
her
had
completely
annihilated
newport
with
its
splendour
she
had
already
consulted
miss
greele
about
it
who
said
that
if
the
was
bleached
first
the
dye
of
would
be
brilliant
and
pure
the
thought
of
that
and
the
fact
that
miss
greele
lips
were
professionally
sealed
made
her
able
to
take
diva
arm
as
they
strolled
about
the
garden
afterwards
the
way
in
which
both
diva
and
susan
had
made
up
to
wyse
during
lunch
was
really
very
shocking
though
it
did
not
surprise
miss
mapp
but
she
supposed
their
heads
had
been
turned
by
the
prospect
of
playing
bridge
with
a
countess
luckily
she
expected
nothing
better
of
either
of
them
so
their
conduct
was
in
no
way
a
blow
or
a
disappointment
to
her
this
companionship
with
diva
was
rather
prolonged
for
the
adhesive
susan
staggering
about
in
her
sables
clung
close
to
their
host
and
simulated
a
clumsy
interest
in
chrysanthemums
and
whatever
the
other
two
did
manoeuvred
herself
into
a
strong
position
between
them
and
wyse
from
which
operating
on
interior
lines
she
could
cut
off
either
assailant
more
depressing
yet
and
throwing
a
sad
new
light
on
his
character
wyse
seemed
to
appreciate
rather
than
resent
the
appropriation
of
himself
and
instead
of
making
a
sortie
through
the
beleaguering
sables
would
beg
diva
and
elizabeth
who
were
so
fond
of
fuchsias
and
knew
about
them
so
well
to
put
their
heads
together
over
an
afflicted
bed
of
these
flowers
in
quite
another
part
of
the
garden
and
tell
him
what
was
the
best
treatment
for
their
anæmic
condition
pleasant
and
proper
though
it
was
to
each
of
them
that
wyse
should
pay
so
little
attention
to
the
other
it
was
bitter
as
the
endive
salad
to
both
that
he
should
tolerate
if
not
enjoy
the
companionship
which
the
forwardness
of
susan
forced
on
him
and
while
they
absently
stared
at
the
fuchsias
the
fire
kindled
and
elizabeth
spake
with
her
tongue
how
very
plain
poor
susan
looks
she
said
such
a
colour
though
to
be
sure
i
attribute
that
more
to
what
she
ate
and
drank
than
to
anything
else
crimson
oh
those
poor
fuchsias
i
think
i
should
throw
them
away
the
common
antagonism
diva
felt
had
drawn
her
and
elizabeth
into
the
most
cordial
of
understandings
for
the
moment
she
felt
nothing
but
enthusiastic
sympathy
with
elizabeth
in
spite
of
her
gown
what
on
earth
in
parenthesis
was
she
to
do
with
hers
she
could
not
give
it
to
janet
it
was
impossible
to
contemplate
the
idea
of
janet
walking
about
the
high
street
in
a
of
just
in
order
to
thwart
elizabeth
wyse
seems
taken
with
her
said
diva
how
he
can
rather
a
snob
she
always
popping
in
here
saw
her
yesterday
going
round
the
corner
of
the
street
what
time
dear
asked
elizabeth
nosing
the
scent
middle
of
the
morning
and
i
saw
her
in
the
afternoon
said
elizabeth
that
great
lumbering
went
tacking
and
skidding
round
the
corner
below
my
was
she
in
it
asked
diva
this
appeared
rather
a
slur
on
elizabeth
reliability
in
observation
no
darling
she
was
sitting
on
the
top
she
said
taking
the
edge
off
the
sarcasm
in
case
diva
had
not
intended
to
be
critical
by
a
little
laugh
diva
drew
the
conclusion
that
elizabeth
had
actually
seen
her
inside
think
it
serious
she
said
think
he
marry
her
the
idea
of
course
repellent
and
odious
as
it
was
had
occurred
to
elizabeth
so
she
instantly
denied
it
oh
you
busy
little
she
said
brightly
such
an
idea
never
entered
my
head
you
should
make
such
fun
of
dear
susan
come
dear
i
ca
look
at
fuchsias
any
more
i
must
be
getting
home
and
must
say
au
reservoir
rather
to
wyse
if
susan
will
allow
me
to
get
a
word
in
edgeways
susan
seemed
delighted
to
let
miss
mapp
get
this
particular
word
in
edgewise
and
after
a
little
speech
from
wyse
in
which
he
said
that
he
would
not
dream
of
allowing
them
to
go
yet
and
immediately
afterwards
shook
hands
warmly
with
them
both
hoping
that
the
reservoir
would
be
a
very
small
one
the
two
were
forced
to
leave
the
artful
susan
in
possession
of
the
field
it
all
looked
rather
black
miss
mapp
vivid
imagination
altogether
failed
to
picture
what
tilling
would
be
like
if
susan
succeeded
in
becoming
wyse
and
the
of
a
countess
and
she
sat
down
in
her
and
closed
her
eyes
for
a
moment
in
order
to
concentrate
her
power
of
figuring
the
situation
what
dreadful
people
these
climbers
were
how
swiftly
they
swarmed
up
the
social
ladder
with
their
and
their
fool
and
their
sables
a
few
weeks
ago
she
herself
had
never
asked
susan
into
her
house
while
the
very
first
time
she
came
she
unloosed
the
sluices
of
the
and
now
owing
to
the
necessity
of
getting
her
aid
in
stopping
that
mischievous
rumour
which
she
herself
had
been
so
careful
to
set
on
foot
regarding
the
cause
of
the
duel
miss
mapp
had
been
positively
obliged
to
flatter
and
to
susan
her
and
if
diva
awful
surmise
proved
to
be
susan
would
be
in
a
position
to
patronize
them
all
and
talk
about
counts
and
countesses
with
the
same
air
of
unconcern
as
wyse
she
would
be
bidden
to
the
villa
faraglione
she
would
play
bridge
with
cecco
and
amelia
she
would
visit
the
wyses
of

what
was
to
be
done
she
might
head
another
movement
to
put
wyse
in
his
proper
place
this
if
successful
would
have
the
agreeable
result
of
pulling
down
susan
a
rung
or
two
should
she
carry
out
her
design
but
the
failure
of
the
last
attempt
and
wyse
eminence
did
not
argue
well
for
any
further
manoeuvre
of
the
kind
or
should
she
poison
wyse
mind
with
regard
to
susan
or
was
she
herself
causelessly
agitated
or
curiosity
rushed
like
a
devastating
tornado
across
miss
mapp
mind
rooting
up
all
other
growths
buffeting
her
with
the
necessity
of
knowing
what
the
two
whom
she
had
been
forced
to
leave
in
the
garden
were
doing
now
and
snatching
up
her
she
glided
upstairs
and
let
herself
out
through
the
on
to
the
roof
she
did
not
remember
if
it
was
possible
to
see
wyse
garden
or
any
part
of
it
from
that
but
there
was
a
chance
not
a
glimpse
of
it
was
visible
it
lay
quite
hidden
behind
the
wall
which
bounded
it
and
not
a
chrysanthemum
or
a
fuchsia
could
she
see
but
her
blood
froze
as
without
putting
the
glasses
down
she
ran
her
eye
over
such
part
of
the
as
rose
above
the
obstruction
in
his
window
on
the
first
floor
were
seated
two
figures

taken
her
sables
off

chapter
viii
the
hippopotamus
quarrel
over
their
whisky
between
major
flint
and
captain
puffin
which
culminated
in
the
challenge
and
all
the
shining
sequel
had
had
the
excellent
effect
of
making
the
united
services
more
united
than
ever
they
both
knew
that
had
they
not
severally
run
away
from
the
encounter
and
so
providentially
met
at
the
station
very
serious
consequences
might
have
ensued
had
not
both
but
only
one
of
them
been
averse
from
taking
or
risking
life
the
other
would
surely
have
remained
in
tilling
and
spread
disastrous
reports
about
the
bravery
of
the
refugee
while
if
neither
of
them
had
had
scruples
on
the
sacredness
of
human
existence
there
might
have
been
one
if
not
two
corpses
lying
on
the
shining
sands
naturally
the
fact
that
they
both
had
taken
the
very
earliest
opportunity
of
averting
an
encounter
by
flight
made
it
improbable
that
any
future
quarrel
would
be
proceeded
with
to
violent
extremes
but
it
was
much
safer
to
run
no
risks
and
not
let
verbal
disagreements
rise
to
again
consequently
when
there
was
any
real
danger
of
such
savagery
as
was
implied
in
sending
challenges
they
hastened
by
mutual
concessions
to
climb
down
from
these
perilous
places
where
loss
of
balance
might
possibly
occur
for
which
of
them
could
be
absolutely
certain
that
next
time
the
other
of
them
might
not
be
more
courageous
they
were
coming
up
from
the
one
november
evening
both
fizzing
and
fuming
a
good
deal
and
the
major
was
extremely
lame
lamer
than
puffin
the
rattle
of
the
tram
had
made
argument
impossible
during
the
transit
from
the
links
but
they
had
both
in
this
enforced
silence
thought
of
several
smart
repartees
supposing
that
the
other
made
the
requisite
remarks
to
call
them
out
and
on
arrival
at
the
tilling
station
they
went
on
at
precisely
the
same
point
at
which
they
had
broken
off
on
starting
from
the
station
by
the
links
well
i
hope
i
can
take
a
beating
in
as
english
a
spirit
as
anybody
said
the
major
this
was
lucky
for
captain
puffin
he
had
thought
it
likely
that
he
would
say
just
that
and
had
got
a
stinger
for
him
and
it
worries
you
to
find
that
your
hopes
are
doomed
to
disappointment
he
swiftly
said
major
flint
stepped
in
a
puddle
which
cooled
his
foot
but
not
his
temper
most
offensive
remark
he
said
i
was
called
sporting
benjy
in
the
regiment
for
nothing
but
never
mind
that
a
it
was
a
said
puffin
it
was
sheep
dung
luck
had
veered
here
the
major
had
felt
sure
that
puffin
would
reiterate
that
utterly
untrue
contention
i
ca
pretend
to
be
such
a
specialist
as
you
in
those
matters
he
said
but
you
must
allow
me
sufficient
power
of
observation
to
know
a
when
i
see
it
it
was
a
sir
a
cast
of
a
worm
and
you
had
no
right
to
remove
it
if
you
will
do
me
the
favour
to
consult
the
rules
of
golf
oh
i
grant
you
that
you
are
more
a
specialist
in
the
rules
of
golf
major
than
in
the
practice
of
it
said
puffin
brightly
suddenly
it
struck
sporting
benjy
that
the
red
signals
of
danger
danced
before
his
eyes
and
though
the
odious
puffin
had
scored
twice
to
his
once
he
called
up
all
his
powers
of
for
if
his
friend
was
anything
like
as
exasperated
as
himself
the
breeze
of
disagreement
might
develop
into
a
hurricane
at
the
moment
he
was
passing
through
a
which
led
to
a
short
cut
back
to
the
town
but
before
he
could
take
hold
of
himself
he
had
slammed
it
back
in
his
fury
hitting
puffin
who
was
following
him
on
the
knee
then
he
remembered
he
was
a
sporting
christian
gentleman
and
no
duellist
i
sure
i
beg
your
pardon
my
dear
fellow
he
said
with
the
utmost
solicitude
uncommonly
stupid
of
me
the
gate
flew
out
of
my
hand
i
hope
i
did
hurt
you
puffin
had
just
come
to
the
same
conclusion
as
major
flint
magnanimity
was
better
than
early
trains
and
ever
so
much
better
than
bullets
indeed
there
was
no
comparison
not
hurt
a
bit
thank
you
major
he
said
wincing
with
the
shrewdness
of
the
blow
silently
cursing
his
friend
for
what
he
felt
sure
was
no
accident
and
limping
with
both
legs
it
did
touch
me
ha
what
a
brilliant
sunset
the
town
looks
amazingly
picturesque
it
does
indeed
said
the
major
fine
subject
for
miss
mapp
puffin
shuffled
alongside
there
still
a
lot
of
talk
going
on
in
the
town
he
said
about
that
duel
of
ours
those
fairies
of
yours
are
all
agog
to
know
what
it
was
about
i
am
sure
they
all
think
that
there
was
a
lady
in
the
case
just
like
the
vanity
of
the
sex
if
two
men
have
a
quarrel
they
think
it
must
be
because
of
their
silly
faces
ordinarily
the
major
gallantry
would
have
resented
this
view
but
the
reconciliation
with
puffin
was
too
recent
to
risk
just
at
present
poor
little
devils
he
said
it
makes
an
excitement
for
them
i
wonder
who
they
think
it
is
it
would
puzzle
me
to
name
a
woman
in
tilling
worth
catching
an
early
train
for
there
are
several
who
be
surprised
to
hear
you
say
that
major
said
puffin
archly
well
well
said
the
other
strutting
and
swelling
and
walking
without
a
sign
of
lameness
they
had
come
to
where
their
houses
stood
opposite
each
other
on
the
steep
cobbled
street
fronted
at
its
top
end
by
miss
mapp
she
happened
to
be
standing
in
the
window
and
the
major
made
a
great
flourish
of
his
cap
and
laid
his
hand
on
his
heart
and
there
one
of
them
said
puffin
as
miss
mapp
acknowledged
these
florid
salutations
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
and
tripped
away
from
the
window
poking
your
fun
at
me
said
the
major
perhaps
she
was
the
cause
of
our
quarrel
hey
well
i
step
across
shall
i
about
nine
and
bring
my
diaries
with
me
i
expect
you
you
find
me
at
my
roman
roads
the
humour
of
this
joke
never
staled
and
they
parted
with
hoots
and
guffaws
of
laughter
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
duelling
puzzles
over
the
portmanteau
or
the
machinations
of
susan
had
put
out
of
miss
mapp
head
her
amiable
interest
in
the
hour
at
which
major
benjy
went
to
bed
for
some
time
she
had
been
content
to
believe
on
direct
information
from
him
that
he
went
to
bed
early
and
worked
at
his
diaries
on
alternate
evenings
but
maturer
consideration
had
led
her
to
wonder
whether
he
was
being
quite
as
truthful
as
a
gallant
soldier
should
be
for
though
on
alternate
evenings
his
house
would
be
quite
dark
by
nine
it
was
not
for
twelve
hours
or
more
afterwards
that
he
could
be
heard
for
his
breakfast
and
unless
he
was
in
some
incipient
stage
of
such
hours
provided
more
than
ample
slumber
for
a
growing
child
and
might
be
considered
excessive
for
a
man
she
had
a
mass
of
evidence
to
show
that
on
the
other
set
of
alternate
nights
his
diaries
which
must
in
parenthesis
be
of
extraordinary
fullness
occupied
him
into
the
small
hours
and
to
go
to
bed
at
nine
on
one
night
and
after
one
on
the
next
implied
a
complicated
kind
of
regularity
which
cried
aloud
for
elucidation
if
he
had
only
breakfasted
early
on
the
mornings
after
he
had
gone
to
bed
early
she
might
have
allowed
herself
to
be
weakly
credulous
but
he
never
earlier
than
nine
and
she
could
not
but
think
that
to
believe
blindly
in
such
habits
would
be
a
triumph
not
for
faith
but
for
foolishness
people
said
miss
mapp
to
herself
as
her
attention
refused
to
concentrate
on
the
evening
paper
do
do
it
i
never
heard
of
a
similar
case
she
had
been
spending
the
evening
alone
and
even
the
conviction
that
her
cold
apple
tart
had
suffered
diminution
by
at
least
a
slice
since
she
had
so
much
enjoyed
it
hot
at
lunch
failed
to
occupy
her
mind
for
long
for
this
matter
had
presented
itself
with
a
clamouring
insistence
that
drowned
all
other
voices
she
had
tried
when
at
the
conclusion
of
her
supper
she
had
gone
back
to
the
to
immerse
herself
in
a
book
in
an
evening
paper
in
the
portmanteau
problem
in
a
puzzle
and
in
patience
but
none
of
these
supplied
the
stimulus
to
lead
her
mind
away
from
major
benjy
evenings
or
the
narcotic
to
dull
her
unslumbering
desire
to
solve
a
problem
that
was
rapidly
becoming
one
of
the
greater
mysteries
her
radiator
made
a
seat
in
the
window
agreeably
warm
and
a
chink
in
the
curtains
gave
her
a
view
of
the
major
lighted
window
even
as
she
looked
the
illumination
was
extinguished
she
had
expected
this
as
he
had
been
at
his
diaries
late
quite
naughtily
late
the
evening
before
so
this
would
be
a
night
of
infant
slumber
for
twelve
hours
or
so
even
as
she
looked
a
chink
of
light
came
from
his
front
door
which
immediately
enlarged
itself
into
a
full
oblong
then
it
went
completely
out
he
has
opened
the
door
and
has
put
out
the
whispered
miss
mapp
to
herself
he
has
gone
out
and
shut
the
door
perhaps
he
is
going
to
post
a
letter
he
has
gone
into
captain
house
without
knocking
so
he
is
expected
miss
mapp
did
not
at
once
guess
that
she
held
in
her
hand
the
key
to
the
mystery
it
was
certainly
major
benjy
night
for
going
to
bed
early
then
a
fierce
illumination
beat
on
her
brain
had
she
not
so
providentially
actually
observed
the
major
cross
the
road
unmistakable
in
the
lamplight
and
had
she
only
looked
out
of
her
window
after
the
light
in
his
was
quenched
she
would
surely
have
told
herself
that
good
major
benjy
had
gone
to
bed
but
good
major
benjy
on
ocular
evidence
she
now
knew
to
have
done
nothing
of
the
kind
he
had
gone
across
to
see
captain
puffin
he
was
not
good
she
grasped
the
situation
in
its
hideous
entirety
she
had
been
deceived
and
hoodwinked
major
benjy
never
went
to
bed
early
at
all
on
alternate
nights
he
went
and
sat
with
captain
puffin
and
captain
puffin
she
could
not
but
tell
herself
sat
up
on
the
other
set
of
alternate
nights
with
the
major
for
it
had
not
escaped
her
observation
that
when
the
major
seemed
to
be
sitting
up
the
captain
seemed
to
have
gone
to
bed
instantly
with
strong
conviction
she
suspected
orgies
it
remained
to
be
seen
and
she
would
remain
to
see
it
to
what
hour
these
orgies
were
kept
up
about
eleven
a
little
mist
had
begun
to
form
in
the
street
obscuring
the
complete
clarity
of
her
view
but
through
it
there
still
shone
the
light
from
behind
captain
puffin
red
blind
and
the
mist
was
not
so
thick
as
to
be
able
wholly
to
obscure
the
figure
of
major
flint
when
he
should
pass
below
the
gas
lamp
again
into
his
house
but
no
such
figure
passed
did
he
then
work
at
his
diaries
every
evening
and
what
price
to
put
it
vulgarly
roman
roads
every
moment
her
sense
of
being
deceived
grew
blacker
and
every
moment
her
curiosity
as
to
what
they
were
doing
became
more
unbearable
after
a
spasm
of
tactical
thought
she
glided
back
into
her
house
from
the
and
taking
an
envelope
in
her
hand
so
that
she
might
if
detected
say
that
she
was
going
down
to
the
at
the
corner
to
catch
the
early
post
she
unbolted
her
door
and
let
herself
out
she
crossed
the
street
and
along
the
pavement
to
where
the
red
light
from
captain
puffin
window
shone
like
a
blurred
through
the
mist
from
inside
came
a
loud
duet
of
familiar
voices
sometimes
they
spoke
singly
sometimes
together
but
she
could
not
catch
the
words
they
sounded
blurred
and
indistinct
and
she
told
herself
that
she
was
very
glad
that
she
could
not
hear
what
they
said
for
that
would
have
seemed
like
the
voices
sounded
angry
was
there
another
duel
pending
and
what
was
it
about
this
time
quite
suddenly
from
so
close
at
hand
that
she
positively
leaped
off
the
pavement
into
the
middle
of
the
road
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
the
duet
louder
than
ever
streamed
out
into
the
street
major
benjy
bounced
out
on
to
the
threshold
and
stumbled
down
the
two
steps
that
led
from
the
door
tell
you
it
was
a
he
bellowed
think
i
do
know
a
when
i
see
a
suddenly
his
tone
changed
this
was
getting
too
near
a
quarrel
well
old
fellow
he
said
jolly
evening
he
turned
and
saw
veiled
and
indistinct
in
the
mist
the
female
figure
in
the
roadway
undying
coquetry
as
stevenson
so
finely
remarked
awoke
for
the
topic
preceding
the
had
been
the
sex
bless
me
he
crowed
if
there
is
an
unprotected
lady
all
here
in
the
dark
and
lost
in
the
fog
me
to
you
home
madam
lem
me
introduce
myself
and
friend
major
flint
that
me
and
my
friend
captain
puffin
he
put
up
his
hand
and
whispered
an
aside
to
miss
mapp
revolutionized
the
theory
of
navigation
major
benjy
was
certainly
rather
gay
and
rather
indistinct
but
his
polite
gallantry
could
not
fail
to
be
attractive
it
was
naughty
of
him
to
have
said
that
he
went
to
bed
early
on
alternate
nights
but
really
still
it
might
be
better
to
slip
away
unrecognized
and
thinking
it
would
be
nice
to
scriggle
by
him
and
disappear
in
the
mist
she
made
a
tactical
error
in
her
scriggling
for
she
scriggled
full
into
the
light
that
streamed
from
the
open
door
where
captain
puffin
was
standing
he
gave
a
shrill
laugh
why
it
miss
mapp
he
said
in
his
high
falsetto
blow
me
if
it
is
our
mutual
friend
miss
mapp
what
a
coincidence
miss
mapp
put
on
her
most
winning
smile
to
be
dignified
and
at
the
same
time
pleasant
was
the
proper
way
to
deal
with
this
situation
gentlemen
often
had
a
glass
of
grog
when
they
thought
the
ladies
had
gone
upstairs
that
was
how
for
the
moment
she
summed
things
up
good
evening
she
said
i
was
just
going
down
to
the
to
post
a
letter
and
she
exhibited
her
envelope
but
it
dropped
out
of
her
hand
and
the
major
picked
it
up
for
her
i
post
it
for
you
he
said
very
pleasantly
save
you
the
trouble
insist
on
it
why
there
no
stamp
on
it
why
there
no
address
on
it
i
say
puffie
here
a
letter
with
no
address
on
it
forgotten
the
address
miss
mapp
think
they
remember
it
at
the
post
office
well
that
one
of
the
mos
comic
things
i
ever
came
across
an
an
anonymous
letter
eh
the
night
air
began
to
have
a
most
unfortunate
effect
on
puffin
when
he
came
out
it
would
have
been
quite
unfair
to
have
described
him
as
drunk
he
was
no
more
than
gay
and
ready
to
go
to
bed
now
he
became
portentously
solemn
as
the
cold
mist
began
to
do
its
deadly
work
a
letter
he
said
impressively
without
an
address
is
an
uncommonly
dangerous
thing
hic
ca
tell
into
whose
hands
it
may
fall
i
would
sooner
go
with
a
loaded
pistol
than
with
a
letter
without
any
address
send
it
to
the
bank
for
safety
send
for
the
police
follow
my
advice
and
send
for
the
police
miss
mapp
penetrating
mind
instantly
perceived
that
that
dreadful
captain
puffin
was
drunk
and
she
promised
herself
that
tilling
should
ring
with
the
tale
of
his
excesses
but
major
benjy
whom
if
she
mistook
not
captain
puffin
had
been
trying
with
perhaps
some
small
success
to
lead
astray
was
a
gallant
gentleman
still
and
she
conceived
the
brilliant
but
madly
mistaken
idea
of
throwing
herself
on
his
protection
major
benjy
she
said
i
will
ask
you
to
take
me
home
captain
puffin
has
had
too
much
to
drink
woz
that
asked
captain
puffin
with
an
air
of
great
interest
miss
mapp
abandoned
dignity
and
pleasantness
and
lost
her
temper
i
said
you
were
drunk
she
said
with
great
distinctness
major
benjy
will
you
captain
puffin
came
carefully
down
the
two
steps
from
the
door
on
to
the
pavement
look
here
he
said
this
all
needs
you
say
i
drunk
do
you
well
i
say
you
drunk
going
out
like
this
in
mill
of
the
night
to
post
letter
with
no
on
it
shamed
of
yourself
woman
going
out
in
the
mill
of
the
night
in
the
mill
of
tilling
very
shocking
thing
what
do
you
say
major
major
benjy
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
and
put
on
his
hat
in
order
to
take
it
off
to
miss
mapp
my
fren
puffin
he
said
is
a
man
of
strictly
habits
boys
together
very
serious
thing
to
call
a
man
of
my
character
drunk
if
you
call
him
drunk
why
should
he
call
you
drunk
ca
take
away
man
character
like
that
abso
began
captain
puffin
then
he
stopped
and
pulled
himself
together
absolooly
he
said
without
a
hitch
tilling
shall
hear
of
this
said
miss
mapp
shivering
with
rage
and
captain
puffin
came
a
step
closer
now
i
tell
you
what
it
is
miss
mapp
he
said
if
you
dare
to
say
that
i
was
drunk
major
and
i
my
fren
the
major
and
i
will
say
you
were
drunk
perhaps
you
think
my
fren
the
major
drunk
too
but
i
live
i
say
we
were
taking
lil
walk
in
the
moonlight
and
found
you
trying
to
post
a
letter
with
no
on
it
and
could
find
the
slit
to
put
it
in
but
as
you
say
nothing
i
say
nothing
ca
say
fairer
than
that
liberal
terms
mutual
protection
society
your
lips
sealed
our
lips
sealed
strictly
private
all
trespassers
will
be
prosecuted
by
order
hic
miss
mapp
felt
that
major
benjy
ought
instantly
to
have
challenged
his
ignoble
friend
to
another
duel
for
this
insolent
suggestion
but
he
did
nothing
of
the
kind
and
his
silence
which
had
some
awful
quality
of
consent
about
it
chilled
her
mind
even
as
the
now
thick
and
cold
made
her
certain
that
her
nose
was
turning
red
she
still
boiled
with
rage
but
her
mind
grew
cold
with
odious
apprehensions
she
was
like
an
with
scalding
sauce
there
they
all
stood
veiled
in
vapours
and
outlined
by
the
red
light
that
streamed
from
the
door
of
the
intoxicated
puffin
getting
colder
every
moment
yessorno
said
puffin
with
chattering
teeth
bitter
as
it
was
to
accept
those
outrageous
terms
there
really
seemed
without
the
major
support
to
be
no
way
out
of
it
yes
said
miss
mapp
puffin
gave
a
loud
crow
the
ayes
have
it
major
he
said
so
we
all
frens
again
goonight
everybody
miss
mapp
let
herself
into
her
house
in
an
agony
of
mortification
she
could
scarcely
realize
that
her
little
expedition
undertaken
with
so
much
ardent
and
earnest
curiosity
only
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
had
ended
in
so
deplorable
a
surfeit
of
sensation
she
had
gone
out
in
obedience
to
an
innocent
and
indeed
laudable
desire
to
ascertain
how
major
benjy
spent
those
evenings
on
which
he
had
deceived
her
into
imagining
that
owing
to
her
influence
he
had
gone
ever
so
early
to
bed
only
to
find
that
he
sat
up
ever
so
late
and
that
she
was
fettered
by
a
promise
not
to
breathe
to
a
soul
a
single
word
about
the
depravity
of
captain
puffin
on
pain
of
being
herself
accused
out
of
the
mouth
of
two
witnesses
of
being
equally
depraved
herself
more
wounding
yet
was
the
part
played
by
her
major
benjy
in
these
odious
transactions
and
it
was
only
possible
to
conclude
that
he
put
a
higher
value
on
his
fellowship
with
his
degraded
friend
than
on
chivalry
itself
and
what
did
his
silence
imply
probably
it
was
a
defensive
one
he
imagined
that
he
too
would
be
included
in
the
stories
that
miss
mapp
proposed
to
sow
broadcast
upon
the
fruitful
fields
of
tilling
and
indeed
when
she
called
to
mind
his
bellowing
about
his
general
instability
of
speech
and
equilibrium
she
told
herself
that
he
had
ample
cause
for
such
a
supposition
he
when
his
lights
were
out
was
abetting
assisting
and
perhaps
joining
captain
puffin
when
his
window
was
alight
on
alternate
nights
she
made
no
doubt
now
that
captain
puffin
was
performing
a
similar
rôle
this
had
been
going
on
for
weeks
under
her
very
nose
without
her
having
the
smallest
suspicion
of
it
humiliated
by
all
that
had
happened
and
flattened
in
her
own
estimation
by
the
sense
of
her
blindness
she
penetrated
to
the
kitchen
and
lit
a
to
make
herself
some
hot
cocoa
which
would
at
least
comfort
her
physical
chatterings
there
was
a
letter
for
withers
slipped
sideways
into
its
envelope
on
the
kitchen
table
and
mechanically
she
opened
and
read
it
by
the
bluish
flame
of
the
burner
she
had
always
suspected
withers
of
having
a
young
man
and
here
was
proof
of
it
but
that
he
should
be
hopkins
of
the
there
is
known
to
medical
science
a
pleasant
device
known
as
a
if
the
patient
has
an
aching
and
rheumatic
joint
he
is
counselled
to
put
some
hot
burning
application
on
the
skin
which
smarts
so
agonizingly
that
the
ache
is
quite
extinguished
metaphorically
hopkins
was
thermogene
to
miss
mapp
outraged
and
aching
consciousness
and
the
smart
occasioned
by
the
knowledge
that
withers
must
have
encouraged
hopkins
else
he
could
scarcely
have
written
a
letter
so
familiar
and
amorous
and
thus
be
contemplating
matrimony
relieved
the
aching
humiliation
of
all
that
had
happened
in
the
it
shed
a
new
and
lurid
light
on
withers
it
made
her
mistress
feel
that
she
had
nourished
a
serpent
in
her
bosom
to
think
that
withers
was
contemplating
so
odious
an
act
of
selfishness
as
matrimony
it
would
be
necessary
to
find
a
new
and
all
the
trouble
connected
with
that
would
not
nearly
be
compensated
for
by
being
able
to
buy
fish
at
a
lower
rate
that
was
the
least
that
withers
could
do
for
her
to
insist
that
hopkins
should
let
her
have
dabs
and
plaice
exceptionally
cheap
and
ought
she
to
tell
withers
that
she
had
seen
hopkins
no
that
was
impossible
she
must
write
it
if
she
decided
for
sake
to
make
this
fell
communication
miss
mapp
turned
and
tossed
on
her
uneasy
bed
and
her
mind
went
back
to
the
major
and
the
captain
and
that
fiasco
in
the
fog
of
course
she
was
perfectly
at
liberty
having
made
her
promise
under
practical
compulsion
to
tell
everybody
in
tilling
what
had
occurred
trusting
to
the
chivalry
of
the
men
not
to
carry
out
their
counter
threat
but
looking
at
the
matter
quite
dispassionately
she
did
not
think
it
would
be
wise
to
trust
too
much
to
chivalry
still
even
if
they
did
carry
out
their
unmanly
menace
nobody
would
seriously
believe
that
she
had
been
drunk
but
they
might
make
a
very
disagreeable
joke
of
pretending
to
do
so
and
in
a
word
the
prospect
frightened
her
whatever
tilling
did
or
did
not
believe
a
residuum
of
ridicule
would
assuredly
cling
to
her
and
her
reputation
of
having
perhaps
been
the
cause
of
the
quarrel
which
so
happily
did
not
end
in
a
duel
would
be
lost
for
ever
evie
would
squeak
quaint
irene
would
certainly
burst
into
hoarse
laughter
when
she
heard
the
story
it
was
very
inconvenient
that
honesty
should
be
the
best
policy
her
brain
still
violently
active
switched
off
for
a
moment
on
to
the
eternal
problem
of
the
portmanteau
why
so
she
asked
herself
for
the
hundredth
time
if
the
portmanteau
contained
the
fatal
apparatus
of
duelling
did
not
the
combatants
accompany
it
and
if
the
only
other
alternative
it
did
not
an
idea
so
luminous
flashed
across
her
brain
that
she
almost
thought
the
room
had
leaped
into
light
the
challenge
distinctly
said
that
major
benjy
seconds
would
wait
upon
captain
puffin
in
the
course
of
the
morning
with
what
object
then
could
the
former
have
gone
down
to
the
station
to
catch
the
early
train
there
could
be
but
one
object
namely
to
get
away
as
quickly
as
possible
from
the
dangerous
vicinity
of
the
challenged
captain
and
why
did
captain
puffin
leave
that
note
on
his
table
to
say
that
he
was
suddenly
called
away
except
in
order
to
escape
from
the
ferocious
neighbourhood
of
his
challenger
the
cowards
ejaculated
miss
mapp
they
both
ran
away
from
each
other
how
blind
i
been
the
veil
was
rent
she
perceived
how
carried
away
with
the
notion
that
a
duel
was
to
be
fought
among
the
tilling
had
quite
overlooked
the
significance
of
the
early
train
she
felt
sure
that
she
had
solved
everything
now
and
gave
herself
up
to
a
rapturous
consideration
of
what
use
she
would
make
of
the
precious
solution
all
regrets
for
the
impossibility
of
ruining
the
character
of
captain
puffin
with
regard
to
intoxicants
were
gone
for
she
had
an
even
deadlier
blacking
to
hand
no
faintest
hesitation
at
ruining
the
reputation
of
major
benjy
as
well
crossed
her
mind
she
gloried
in
it
for
he
had
not
only
caused
her
to
deceive
herself
about
the
early
hours
on
alternate
nights
but
by
his
infamous
willingness
to
back
up
captain
bargain
he
had
shown
himself
imperviously
waterproof
to
all
chivalrous
impulses
for
weeks
now
the
sorry
pair
of
them
had
enjoyed
the
spurious
splendours
of
being
men
of
blood
and
valour
when
all
the
time
they
had
put
themselves
to
all
sorts
of
inconvenience
in
catching
early
trains
and
packing
bags
by
in
order
to
escape
the
hot
impulses
of
quarrel
that
as
she
saw
now
were
probably
derived
from
drained
that
mysterious
holloaing
about
was
just
such
another
disagreement
and
crowning
rapture
of
all
her
own
position
as
cause
of
the
projected
duel
was
quite
unassailed
owing
to
her
silence
about
drink
no
one
would
suspect
a
mere
drunken
brawl
she
would
still
figure
as
heroine
though
the
heroes
were
terribly
dismantled
to
be
sure
it
would
have
been
better
if
their
ardour
about
her
had
been
such
that
one
of
them
at
the
least
had
been
prepared
to
face
the
ordeal
that
they
had
not
both
preferred
flight
but
even
without
that
she
had
much
to
be
thankful
for
it
will
serve
them
both
said
miss
mapp
interrupted
by
a
sneeze
for
she
had
been
sitting
up
in
bed
for
quite
a
considerable
time
right
to
one
of
miss
mapp
experience
the
first
step
of
her
new
and
delightful
strategic
campaign
was
obvious
and
she
spent
hardly
any
time
at
all
in
the
window
of
her
after
breakfast
next
morning
but
set
out
with
her
at
an
unusually
early
hour
she
shuddered
as
she
passed
between
the
front
doors
of
her
miscreant
neighbours
for
the
chill
of
last
night
mist
and
its
dreadful
memories
still
lingered
there
but
her
present
errand
warmed
her
soul
even
as
the
tepid
november
day
comforted
her
body
no
sign
of
life
was
at
present
evident
in
those
bibulous
abodes
no
had
indicated
breakfast
and
she
put
her
utmost
irony
into
the
reflection
that
the
united
services
slept
late
after
their
protracted
industry
last
night
over
diaries
and
roman
roads
by
a
natural
revulsion
violent
in
proportion
to
the
depth
of
her
previous
regard
for
major
benjy
she
hugged
herself
more
closely
on
the
prospect
of
exposing
him
than
on
that
of
exposing
the
other
she
had
had
daydreams
about
major
benjy
and
the
conversion
of
these
into
nightmares
annealed
her
softness
into
the
semblance
of
some
stone
giving
vengeance
a
concentrated
sweetness
as
of
saccharine
contrasted
with
ordinary
lump
sugar
this
sweetness
was
of
so
powerful
a
quality
that
she
momentarily
forgot
all
about
the
contents
of
withers
letter
on
the
kitchen
table
and
tripped
across
to
hopkins
with
an
oblivious
smile
for
him
good
morning
hopkins
she
said
i
wonder
if
you
got
a
nice
little
dab
for
my
dinner
yes
will
you
send
it
up
then
please
what
a
mild
morning
like
may
the
opening
move
of
course
was
to
tell
diva
about
the
revelation
that
had
burst
on
her
the
night
before
diva
was
incomparably
the
best
disseminator
of
news
she
walked
so
fast
and
her
telegraphic
style
was
so
brisk
and
lucid
her
terse
tongue
her
revolving
feet
such
a
gossip
diva
darling
i
had
to
look
in
a
moment
said
elizabeth
pecking
her
affectionately
on
both
cheeks
such
a
bit
of
news
oh
contessa
di
faradidleony
said
diva
sarcastically
i
heard
yesterday
journey
put
off
miss
mapp
just
managed
to
stifle
the
excitement
which
would
have
betrayed
that
this
was
news
to
her
no
dear
not
that
she
said
i
did
suspect
you
of
not
knowing
that
unfortunate
though
is
it
just
when
we
were
all
beginning
to
believe
that
there
was
a
contessa
di
faradidleony
what
a
sweet
name
for
my
part
i
shall
believe
in
her
when
i
see
her
poor
mr
wyse
what
the
news
then
asked
diva
my
dear
it
all
came
upon
me
in
a
flash
said
elizabeth
it
explains
the
portmanteau
and
the
early
train
and
the
duel
diva
looked
disappointed
she
thought
this
was
to
be
some
solid
piece
of
news
not
one
of
elizabeth
ideas
only
drive
ahead
she
said
they
ran
away
from
each
other
said
elizabeth
mouthing
her
words
as
if
speaking
to
a
totally
deaf
person
who
understood
never
mind
the
cause
of
the
duel
that
another
affair
but
whatever
the
cause
here
she
dropped
her
eyes
the
major
having
sent
the
challenge
packed
his
portmanteau
he
ran
away
dear
diva
and
met
captain
puffin
at
the
station
running
away
too
but
did
began
diva
yes
dear
the
note
on
captain
puffin
table
to
his
housekeeper
said
he
was
called
away
suddenly
what
called
him
away
cowardice
dear
how
ignoble
it
all
is
and
we
all
been
thinking
how
brave
and
wonderful
they
were
they
fled
from
each
other
and
came
back
together
and
played
golf
i
never
thought
it
was
a
game
for
men
the
where
they
were
supposed
to
be
fighting
they
might
lose
a
ball
there
but
that
would
be
the
utmost
not
a
life
poor
padre
going
out
there
to
stop
a
duel
and
only
finding
a
game
of
golf
but
i
understand
the
nature
of
men
better
now
what
an
diva
by
this
time
was
trundling
away
round
the
room
and
longing
to
be
off
in
order
to
tell
everybody
she
could
find
no
hole
in
arguments
it
was
founded
as
solidly
as
a
euclidean
proposition
ever
occurred
to
you
that
they
drink
she
asked
believe
in
roman
roads
and
diaries
i
do
miss
mapp
bounded
from
her
chair
danger
flags
flapped
and
crimsoned
in
her
face
what
if
diva
went
flying
round
tilling
suggesting
that
in
addition
to
being
cowards
those
two
men
were
drunkards
they
would
as
soon
as
any
hint
of
the
further
exposure
reached
them
conclude
that
she
had
set
the
idea
on
foot
and
then
no
diva
darling
she
said
do
dream
of
imagining
such
a
thing
so
dangerous
to
hint
anything
of
the
sort
cowards
they
may
be
and
indeed
are
but
never
have
i
seen
anything
that
leads
me
to
suppose
that
they
drink
we
must
give
them
their
due
and
stick
to
what
we
know
we
must
not
launch
accusations
wildly
about
other
matters
just
because
we
know
they
are
cowards
a
coward
need
not
be
a
drunkard
thank
god
it
is
all
miserable
enough
as
it
is
having
averted
this
danger
miss
mapp
with
her
radiant
excited
face
seemed
to
be
bearing
all
the
misery
very
courageously
and
as
diva
could
no
longer
be
restrained
from
starting
on
her
morning
round
they
plunged
together
into
the
maelstrom
of
the
high
street
riding
and
whirling
in
its
waters
with
the
solution
of
the
portmanteau
and
the
early
train
for
very
little
shopping
was
done
that
morning
for
every
permutation
and
combination
of
tilling
society
with
the
exception
of
course
of
the
cowards
had
to
be
formed
on
the
pavement
with
a
view
to
the
amplest
possible
discussion
diva
as
might
have
been
expected
gave
proof
of
her
accustomed
perfidy
before
long
for
she
certainly
gave
the
padre
to
understand
that
the
chain
of
inductive
reasoning
was
of
her
own
welding
and
elizabeth
had
to
hurry
after
him
to
correct
this
grabbing
impression
but
the
discovery
in
itself
was
so
great
that
small
false
notes
like
these
could
not
spoil
the
glorious
harmony
even
wyse
abandoned
his
usual
neutrality
with
regard
to
social
politics
and
left
his
tall
malacca
cane
in
the
chemist
so
keen
was
his
gusto
on
seeing
miss
mapp
on
the
pavement
outside
to
glean
any
fresh
detail
of
evidence
by
eleven
that
morning
the
two
duellists
were
universally
known
as
the
cowards
the
padre
alone
demurring
and
being
swampingly
outvoted
he
held
sticking
up
for
his
sex
that
the
major
had
been
brave
enough
to
send
a
challenge
on
whatever
subject
to
his
friend
and
had
though
he
subsequently
failed
to
maintain
that
high
level
shown
courage
of
a
high
order
since
for
all
he
knew
captain
puffin
might
have
accepted
it
miss
mapp
was
spokesman
for
the
mind
of
tilling
on
this
too
indulgent
judgment
dear
padre
she
said
you
are
too
generous
altogether
they
both
ran
away
you
ca
get
over
that
besides
you
must
remember
that
when
the
major
sent
the
challenge
he
knew
captain
puffin
oh
so
well
and
quite
expected
he
would
run
away
then
why
did
he
run
away
himself
asked
the
padre
this
was
rather
puzzling
for
a
moment
but
miss
mapp
soon
thought
of
the
explanation
oh
just
to
make
sure
she
said
and
tilling
applauded
her
ready
irony
and
then
came
the
climax
of
sensationalism
when
at
about
ten
minutes
past
eleven
the
two
cowards
emerged
into
the
high
street
on
their
way
to
catch
the
tram
out
to
the
links
the
day
threatened
rain
and
they
both
carried
bags
which
contained
a
change
of
clothes
just
round
the
corner
of
the
high
street
was
the
group
which
had
applauded
miss
mapp
quickness
and
the
cowards
were
among
the
breakers
they
glanced
at
each
other
seeing
that
miss
mapp
was
the
most
towering
of
the
breakers
but
it
was
too
late
to
retreat
and
they
made
the
usual
salutations
good
morning
said
diva
with
her
voice
trembling
off
to
catch
the
early
train
together
i
mean
the
tram
good
morning
captain
puffin
said
miss
mapp
with
extreme
sweetness
what
a
nice
little
travelling
bag
oh
and
the
major
got
one
too
h
a
certain
dismay
looked
from
major
flint
eyes
captain
puffin
mouth
fell
open
and
he
forgot
to
shut
it
yes
change
of
clothes
said
the
major
it
looks
a
threatening
morning
very
threatening
said
miss
mapp
i
hope
you
will
do
nothing
rash
or
dangerous
there
was
a
moment
silence
and
the
two
looked
from
one
face
to
another
of
this
fell
group
they
all
wore
fixed
inexplicable
smiles
it
will
be
pleasant
among
the
said
the
padre
and
his
wife
gave
a
loud
squeak
well
we
shall
be
missing
our
tram
said
the
major
au
au
reservoir
ladies
nobody
responded
at
all
and
they
hurried
off
down
the
street
their
bags
bumping
together
very
inconveniently
something
up
major
said
puffin
with
true
tilling
perspicacity
as
soon
as
they
had
got
out
of
hearing
precisely
at
the
same
moment
miss
mapp
gave
a
little
cooing
laugh
now
i
must
run
and
do
my
bittie
shopping
padre
she
said
and
kissed
her
hand
all
round
the
curtain
had
to
come
down
for
a
little
while
on
so
dramatic
a
situation
any
discussion
just
then
would
be
an
chapter
ix
captain
puffin
found
but
a
sombre
diarist
when
he
came
over
to
study
his
roman
roads
with
major
flint
that
evening
and
indeed
he
was
a
sombre
antiquarian
himself
they
had
pondered
a
good
deal
during
the
day
over
their
strange
reception
in
the
high
street
that
morning
and
the
recondite
allusions
to
bags
and
early
trains
and
the
more
they
pondered
the
more
probable
it
became
that
not
only
was
something
up
but
as
regards
the
duel
everything
was
up
for
weeks
now
they
had
been
regarded
by
the
ladies
of
tilling
with
something
approaching
veneration
but
there
seemed
singularly
little
veneration
at
the
back
of
the
comments
this
morning
following
so
closely
on
the
encounter
with
miss
mapp
last
night
this
irreverent
attitude
was
probably
due
to
some
atheistical
manoeuvre
of
hers
such
at
least
was
the
major
view
and
when
he
held
a
view
he
usually
stated
it
did
sporting
benjy
we
got
you
to
thank
for
this
puffin
he
said
upon
my
soul
i
was
ashamed
of
you
for
saying
what
you
did
to
miss
mapp
last
night
utter
absence
of
any
chivalrous
feeling
hinting
that
if
she
said
you
were
drunk
you
would
say
she
was
she
was
as
sober
and
lucid
last
night
as
she
was
this
morning
and
she
was
devilish
lucid
to
my
mind
this
morning
pity
you
did
take
her
part
last
night
said
puffin
you
thought
that
was
a
very
ingenious
idea
of
mine
to
make
her
hold
her
tongue
there
are
finer
things
in
this
world
sir
than
ingenuity
said
the
major
what
your
ingenuity
has
led
to
is
this
public
ridicule
you
may
not
mind
that
yourself
you
may
be
used
to
it
but
a
man
should
regard
the
consequences
of
his
act
on
others
my
status
in
tilling
is
completely
changed
changed
for
the
worse
sir
puffin
emitted
his
fluty
disagreeable
laugh
if
your
status
in
tilling
depended
on
a
reputation
for
bloodthirsty
bravery
he
said
the
sooner
it
was
changed
the
better
we
in
the
same
boat
i
do
say
i
like
the
boat
but
there
we
are
have
a
drink
and
you
feel
better
never
mind
your
status
i
a
good
mind
never
to
have
a
drink
again
said
the
major
pouring
himself
out
one
of
his
stiff
little
glasses
if
a
drink
leads
to
this
sort
of
thing
but
it
did
said
puffin
how
it
all
got
out
i
ca
say
nor
for
that
matter
can
you
if
it
had
been
for
me
last
night
it
would
have
been
all
over
tilling
that
you
and
i
were
tipsy
as
well
that
have
improved
our
status
that
i
can
see
it
was
in
consequence
of
what
you
said
to
mapp
began
the
major
but
good
lord
where
the
connection
asked
puffin
produce
the
connection
let
have
a
look
at
the
connection
there
ai
any
connection
duelling
was
as
much
as
mentioned
last
night
major
flint
pondered
this
in
gloomy
sipping
silence
at
poppit
the
day
after
he
said
i
do
feel
as
if
i
could
face
it
suppose
they
all
go
on
making
allusions
to
duelling
and
early
trains
and
that
i
sha
be
able
to
keep
my
mind
on
the
cards
for
fear
of
it
more
than
a
sensitive
man
ought
to
be
asked
to
bear
puffin
made
a
noise
that
sounded
rather
like
fudge
your
pardon
said
the
major
haughtily
granted
by
all
means
said
puffin
but
i
do
see
what
you
in
such
a
taking
about
we
no
worse
off
than
we
were
before
we
got
a
reputation
for
being
such
being
is
a
that
all
pleasant
while
it
lasted
and
now
we
as
we
were
but
we
not
said
the
major
we
detected
frauds
that
not
the
same
as
being
a
fraud
far
from
it
and
who
going
to
rub
it
in
my
friend
who
been
rubbing
away
for
all
she
worth
miss
mapp
to
whom
if
i
may
say
so
without
offence
you
behaved
like
a
cur
last
night
and
another
cur
stood
by
and
wagged
his
tail
retorted
puffin
this
was
about
as
far
as
it
was
safe
to
go
and
puffin
hastened
to
say
something
pleasant
about
the
hearthrug
to
which
his
friend
had
a
suitable
rejoinder
but
after
the
affair
last
night
and
the
dark
sayings
in
the
high
street
this
morning
there
was
little
content
or
cosiness
about
the
session
puffin
brazen
optimism
was
but
a
tinkling
cymbal
and
the
major
did
not
feel
like
tinkling
at
all
he
but
snorted
and
glowered
revolving
in
his
mind
how
to
square
miss
mapp
allied
with
her
if
she
could
but
be
won
over
he
felt
he
could
face
the
rest
of
tilling
with
indifference
for
hers
would
be
the
most
penetrating
shafts
the
most
stinging
pleasantries
he
had
more
too
so
he
reflected
to
lose
than
puffin
for
till
the
affair
of
the
duel
the
other
had
never
been
credited
with
deeds
of
bloodthirsty
gallantry
whereas
he
had
enjoyed
no
end
of
a
reputation
in
amorous
and
honourable
affairs
marriage
no
doubt
would
settle
it
satisfactorily
but
this
bachelor
life
with
plenty
of
golf
and
diaries
was
not
to
be
lightly
exchanged
for
the
unknown
short
of
that
a
light
broke
and
he
got
to
his
feet
following
the
gleam
and
walking
very
lame
out
of
general
discomfiture
tell
you
what
it
is
puffin
he
said
you
and
i
particularly
you
owe
that
estimable
lady
a
very
profound
apology
for
what
happened
last
night
you
ought
to
withdraw
every
word
you
said
and
i
every
word
that
i
did
say
ca
be
done
said
puffin
that
would
be
giving
up
my
hold
over
your
lady
friend
we
should
be
known
as
drunkards
all
over
the
shop
before
you
could
say
winkie
worse
off
than
before
not
a
bit
of
it
if
it
miss
mapp
and
i
sure
it
is
who
has
been
spreading
these
these
damaging
rumours
about
our
duel
it
because
she
outraged
and
offended
quite
rightly
at
your
conduct
to
her
last
night
mine
too
if
you
like
ample
apology
sir
that
the
ticket
said
puffin
no
thanks
very
objectionable
expression
said
major
flint
but
you
shall
do
as
you
like
and
so
with
your
permission
shall
i
shall
apologize
for
my
share
in
that
sorry
performance
in
which
thank
god
i
only
played
a
minor
rôle
that
my
view
and
if
you
do
like
it
you
may
dislike
it
puffin
yawned
mapp
a
cat
he
said
stroke
a
cat
and
you
get
scratched
shy
a
brick
at
a
cat
and
she
spit
at
you
and
skedaddle
you
poor
company
major
with
all
these
qualms
then
sir
you
can
relieve
yourself
of
my
company
said
the
major
by
going
home
just
what
i
was
about
to
do
good
night
old
boy
same
time
for
the
tram
if
you
not
too
badly
mauled
miss
mapp
sitting
by
the
pipes
in
the
looked
out
not
long
after
to
see
what
the
night
was
like
though
it
was
not
yet
ten
the
cowards
were
both
dark
and
she
wondered
what
precisely
that
meant
there
was
no
anywhere
that
night
and
apparently
there
were
no
diaries
or
roman
roads
either
why
this
sober
and
chastened
darkness
the
major
for
his
breakfast
at
an
unusually
early
hour
next
morning
for
the
courage
of
this
resolve
to
placate
if
possible
the
hostility
of
miss
mapp
had
not
like
that
of
the
challenge
oozed
out
during
the
night
he
had
dressed
himself
in
his
seen
last
on
the
occasion
when
the
prince
of
wales
proved
not
to
have
come
by
the
and
no
female
breast
however
furious
could
fail
to
recognize
the
compliment
of
such
a
formality
dressed
thus
with
and
boots
he
was
clearly
observed
from
the
to
emerge
into
the
street
just
when
captain
puffin
hand
thrust
the
sponge
on
to
the
of
his
probably
he
too
had
observed
this
apparition
for
his
fingers
prematurely
loosed
hold
of
the
sponge
and
it
bounded
into
the
street
wild
surmises
flashed
into
miss
active
brain
the
most
likely
of
which
was
that
major
benjy
was
going
to
propose
to
poppit
for
if
he
had
been
going
up
to
london
for
some
ceremonial
occasion
he
would
be
walking
down
the
street
instead
of
up
it
and
then
she
saw
his
agitated
finger
press
the
electric
bell
of
her
own
door
so
he
was
not
on
his
way
to
propose
to
poppit
she
slid
from
the
room
and
hurried
across
the
few
steps
of
garden
to
the
house
just
in
time
to
intercept
withers
though
not
with
any
idea
of
saying
that
she
was
out
then
withers
according
to
instructions
waited
till
miss
mapp
had
tiptoed
upstairs
and
conducted
the
major
to
the
promising
that
she
would
tell
her
mistress
this
was
unnecessary
as
her
mistress
knew
the
major
pressed
a
into
her
astonished
hand
thinking
it
was
a
florin
he
could
precisely
account
for
that
impulse
but
general
propitiation
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
miss
mapp
meantime
had
sat
down
on
her
bed
and
firmly
rejected
the
idea
that
his
call
had
anything
to
do
with
marriage
during
all
these
years
of
friendliness
he
had
not
got
so
far
as
that
and
whatever
the
future
might
hold
it
was
not
likely
that
he
would
begin
now
at
this
moment
when
she
was
so
properly
punishing
him
for
his
unchivalrous
behaviour
but
what
could
the
mean
there
was
captain
puffin
servant
picking
up
the
sponge
she
hoped
it
was
covered
with
mud
it
would
be
a
very
just
continuation
of
his
punishment
to
tell
withers
she
would
not
see
him
but
the
punishment
which
that
would
entail
on
herself
would
be
more
than
she
could
bear
for
she
would
not
know
a
moment
peace
while
she
was
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
his
errand
could
he
be
on
his
way
to
the
padre
to
challenge
him
for
that
very
stinging
allusion
to
yesterday
and
was
he
come
to
give
her
fair
warning
so
that
she
might
stop
a
duel
it
did
not
seem
likely
unable
to
bear
the
suspense
any
longer
she
adjusted
her
face
in
the
glass
to
an
expression
of
frozen
dignity
and
threw
over
her
shoulders
the
cloak
trimmed
with
blue
in
which
on
the
occasion
of
the
prince
visit
she
had
sat
down
in
the
middle
of
the
road
that
matched
the
major
she
hummed
a
little
song
as
she
mounted
the
few
steps
to
the
and
stopped
just
after
she
had
opened
the
door
she
did
not
offer
to
shake
hands
you
wish
to
see
me
major
flint
she
said
in
such
a
voice
as
icebergs
might
be
supposed
to
use
when
passing
each
other
by
night
in
the
arctic
seas
major
flint
certainly
looked
as
if
he
hated
seeing
her
instead
of
wishing
it
for
he
backed
into
a
corner
of
the
room
and
dropped
his
hat
good
morning
miss
mapp
he
said
very
good
of
you
i
i
called
he
clearly
had
a
difficulty
in
saying
what
he
had
come
to
say
but
if
he
thought
that
she
was
proposing
to
give
him
the
smallest
assistance
he
was
in
error
yes
you
called
said
she
pray
be
seated
he
did
so
she
stood
he
got
up
again
i
called
said
the
major
i
called
to
express
my
very
deep
regret
at
my
share
or
rather
that
i
did
not
take
a
more
active
share
i
allowed
in
fact
a
friend
of
mine
to
speak
to
you
in
a
manner
that
did
equal
discredit
miss
mapp
put
her
head
on
one
side
as
if
trying
to
recollect
some
trivial
and
unimportant
occurrence
yes
she
said
what
was
that
captain
puffin
began
the
major
then
miss
mapp
remembered
it
all
i
hope
major
flint
she
said
that
you
will
not
find
it
necessary
to
mention
captain
puffin
name
to
me
i
wish
him
nothing
but
well
but
he
and
his
are
no
concern
of
mine
i
have
the
charity
to
suppose
that
he
was
quite
drunk
on
the
occasion
to
which
i
imagine
you
allude
intoxication
alone
could
excuse
what
he
said
let
us
leave
captain
puffin
out
of
whatever
you
have
come
to
say
to
me
this
was
adroit
it
compelled
the
major
to
begin
all
over
again
i
come
entirely
on
my
own
account
he
began
i
understand
said
miss
mapp
instantly
bringing
captain
puffin
in
again
captain
puffin
now
i
presume
sober
has
no
regret
for
what
he
said
when
drunk
i
quite
see
and
i
expected
no
more
and
no
less
from
him
yes
i
am
afraid
i
interrupted
you
major
flint
threw
his
friend
overboard
like
ballast
from
a
bumping
balloon
i
speak
for
myself
he
said
i
behaved
miss
mapp
like
a
ha
worm
defenceless
lady
insolent
fellow
drunk
i
allude
to
captain
p
very
sorry
for
my
part
in
it
up
till
this
moment
miss
mapp
had
not
made
up
her
mind
whether
she
intended
to
forgive
him
or
not
but
here
she
saw
how
crushing
a
penalty
she
might
be
able
to
inflict
on
puffin
if
she
forgave
the
erring
and
possibly
truly
repentant
major
he
had
already
spoken
strongly
about
his
friend
offence
and
she
could
render
life
supremely
nasty
for
them
both
particularly
puffin
if
she
made
the
major
agree
that
he
could
not
if
truly
sorry
hold
further
intercourse
with
him
there
would
be
no
more
golf
no
more
diaries
besides
if
she
was
observed
to
be
friendly
with
the
major
again
and
to
cut
captain
puffin
a
very
natural
interpretation
would
be
that
she
had
learned
that
in
the
original
quarrel
the
major
had
been
defending
her
from
some
odious
tongue
to
the
extent
of
a
challenge
even
though
he
subsequently
ran
away
tilling
was
quite
clever
enough
to
make
that
inference
without
any
suggestion
from
her
but
if
she
forgave
neither
of
them
they
would
probably
go
on
boozing
and
golfing
together
and
saying
quite
dreadful
things
about
her
and
not
care
very
much
whether
she
forgave
them
or
not
her
mind
was
made
up
and
she
gave
a
wan
smile
oh
major
flint
she
said
it
hurt
me
so
dreadfully
that
you
should
have
stood
by
and
heard
that
man
if
he
is
a
man
say
those
awful
things
to
me
and
not
take
my
side
it
made
me
feel
so
lonely
i
had
always
been
such
good
friends
with
you
and
then
you
turned
your
back
on
me
like
that
i
did
know
what
i
had
done
to
deserve
it
i
lay
awake
ever
so
long
this
was
affecting
and
he
violently
rubbed
the
nap
of
his
hat
the
wrong
way
then
miss
mapp
broke
into
her
sunniest
smile
oh
i
so
glad
you
came
to
say
you
were
sorry
she
said
dear
major
benjy
we
quite
friends
again
she
dabbed
her
handkerchief
on
her
eyes
so
foolish
of
me
she
said
now
sit
down
in
my
most
comfortable
chair
and
have
a
cigarette
major
flint
made
a
peck
at
the
hand
she
extended
to
him
and
cleared
his
throat
to
indicate
emotion
it
really
was
a
great
relief
to
think
that
she
would
not
make
awful
allusions
to
duels
in
the
middle
of
and
since
you
feel
as
you
do
about
captain
puffin
she
said
of
course
you
wo
see
anything
more
of
him
you
and
i
are
quite
one
are
we
about
that
you
have
dissociated
yourself
from
him
completely
the
fact
of
your
being
sorry
does
that
it
was
quite
clear
to
the
major
that
this
condition
was
involved
in
his
forgiveness
though
that
fact
so
obvious
to
miss
mapp
had
not
occurred
to
him
before
still
he
had
to
accept
it
or
go
unhouseled
again
he
could
explain
to
puffin
under
cover
of
night
or
perhaps
in
alphabet
from
his
window
infamous
unforgivable
behaviour
he
said
pah
so
glad
you
feel
that
said
miss
mapp
smiling
till
he
saw
the
entire
row
of
her
fine
teeth
and
oh
may
i
say
one
little
thing
more
i
feel
this
i
feel
that
the
dreadful
shock
to
me
of
being
insulted
like
that
was
quite
a
lovely
little
blessing
in
disguise
now
that
the
effect
has
been
to
put
an
end
to
your
intimacy
with
him
i
never
liked
it
and
i
liked
it
less
than
ever
the
other
night
he
not
a
fit
friend
for
you
oh
i
so
thankful
major
flint
saw
that
for
the
present
he
was
irrevocably
committed
to
this
clause
in
the
treaty
of
peace
he
could
not
face
seeing
it
torn
up
again
as
it
certainly
would
be
if
he
failed
to
accept
it
in
its
entirety
nor
could
he
imagine
himself
leaving
the
room
with
a
renewal
of
hostilities
he
would
lose
his
game
of
golf
as
it
was
for
apart
from
the
fact
that
he
would
scarcely
have
time
to
change
his
clothes
the
idea
of
playing
golf
in
a
and
was
inconceivable
and
catch
the
tram
he
could
not
be
seen
in
puffin
company
at
all
and
indeed
in
the
future
unless
puffin
could
be
induced
to
apologize
and
miss
mapp
to
forgive
he
saw
if
he
was
to
play
golf
at
all
with
his
friend
that
endless
deceptions
and
subterfuges
were
necessary
in
order
to
escape
detection
one
of
them
would
have
to
set
out
ten
minutes
before
the
other
and
walk
to
the
tram
by
some
unusual
and
circuitous
route
they
would
have
to
play
in
a
clandestine
and
furtive
manner
parting
company
before
they
got
to
the
disguises
might
be
needful
there
was
a
peck
of
difficulties
ahead
but
he
would
have
to
go
into
these
later
at
present
he
must
be
immersed
in
the
rapture
of
his
forgiveness
most
generous
of
you
miss
elizabeth
he
said
as
for
that
well
i
wo
allude
to
him
again
miss
mapp
gave
a
happy
little
laugh
and
having
made
a
further
plan
switched
away
from
the
subject
of
captains
and
insults
with
alacrity
look
she
said
i
found
these
little
rosebuds
in
flower
still
though
it
is
the
end
of
november
such
brave
little
darlings
are
they
one
for
your
major
benjy
and
then
i
must
do
my
little
shoppings
or
withers
will
scold
me
withers
is
so
severe
with
me
keeps
me
in
such
order
if
you
are
going
into
the
town
will
you
take
me
with
you
i
will
put
on
my
hat
requests
for
the
present
were
certainly
commands
and
two
minutes
later
they
set
forth
luck
as
usual
befriended
ability
for
there
was
puffin
at
his
door
itching
for
the
major
return
else
they
would
miss
the
tram
and
lo
there
came
stepping
along
miss
mapp
in
her
cloak
and
the
major
attired
as
for
marriage
and
she
did
not
look
at
puffin
and
cut
him
she
did
not
seem
with
the
deceptiveness
of
appearances
to
see
him
at
all
so
eager
and
agreeable
was
her
conversation
with
her
companion
the
major
so
puffin
thought
attempted
to
give
him
some
sort
of
dazed
and
hunted
glance
but
he
could
not
be
certain
even
of
that
so
swiftly
had
it
to
be
transformed
into
a
genial
interest
in
what
miss
mapp
was
saying
and
puffin
stared
after
them
for
they
were
terrible
as
an
army
with
banners
then
diva
trundling
swiftly
out
of
the
came
as
well
she
might
to
a
dead
halt
observing
this
absolutely
inexplicable
phenomenon
good
morning
diva
darling
said
miss
mapp
major
benjy
and
i
are
doing
our
little
shopping
together
so
kind
of
him
is
it
and
very
naughty
of
me
to
take
up
his
time
i
told
him
he
ought
to
be
playing
golf
such
a
lovely
day
au
reservoir
sweet
oh
and
there
the
padre
major
benjy
how
quickly
he
walks
yes
he
sees
us
and
there
poppit
everybody
is
enjoying
the
sunshine
what
a
beautiful
fur
coat
though
i
should
think
she
found
it
very
heavy
and
warm
good
morning
dear
susan
you
shopping
too
like
major
benjy
and
me
how
is
your
dear
isabel
miss
mapp
made
the
most
of
that
morning
the
magnanimity
of
her
forgiveness
earned
her
incredible
dividends
up
and
down
the
high
street
she
went
with
major
benjy
in
attendance
buying
grocery
stationery
gloves
the
literary
supplement
of
dried
camomile
flowers
and
every
conceivable
thing
that
she
might
possibly
need
in
the
next
week
so
that
her
shopping
might
be
as
protracted
as
possible
she
allowed
him
such
was
her
firmness
in
spoiling
him
to
carry
her
and
when
that
was
full
she
decked
him
like
a
sacrificial
ram
with
little
parcels
hung
by
loops
of
string
sometimes
she
took
him
into
a
shop
in
case
there
might
be
someone
there
who
had
not
seen
him
yet
on
her
leash
sometimes
she
left
him
on
the
pavement
in
a
prominent
position
marking
all
the
time
just
as
if
she
had
been
a
clinical
thermometer
the
feverish
curiosity
that
was
burning
in
tilling
veins
only
yesterday
she
had
spread
the
news
of
his
cowardice
broadcast
their
comradeship
was
of
the
chattiest
and
most
genial
kind
there
he
was
carrying
her
basket
and
wearing
and
and
hung
with
parcels
like
a
spending
the
entire
morning
with
her
instead
of
golfing
with
puffin
miss
mapp
positively
shuddered
as
she
tried
to
realize
what
her
state
of
mind
would
have
been
if
she
had
seen
him
thus
coupled
with
diva
she
would
have
suspected
rightly
in
all
probability
some
loathsome
intrigue
against
herself
and
the
cream
of
it
was
that
until
she
chose
nobody
could
possibly
find
out
what
had
caused
this
metamorphosis
so
paralysing
to
inquiring
intellects
for
major
benjy
would
assuredly
never
tell
anyone
that
there
was
a
reconciliation
due
to
his
apology
for
his
rudeness
when
he
had
stood
by
and
permitted
an
intoxicated
puffin
to
suggest
disgraceful
bargains
tilling
poor
tilling
would
go
crazy
with
suspense
as
to
what
it
all
meant
never
had
there
been
such
a
shopping
it
was
nearly
when
at
her
front
door
major
flint
finally
stripped
himself
of
her
parcels
and
her
companionship
and
hobbled
home
profusely
perspiring
and
lame
from
so
much
walking
on
pavements
in
tight
shoes
he
was
weary
and
footsore
he
had
had
no
golf
and
though
forgiven
was
but
a
wreck
she
had
made
him
ridiculous
all
the
morning
with
his
and
and
his
porterages
and
if
forgiveness
entailed
any
more
of
these
nightmare
sacraments
of
friendliness
he
felt
that
he
would
be
unable
to
endure
the
fatiguing
accessories
of
the
regenerate
state
he
hung
up
his
and
wiped
his
wet
and
throbbing
head
he
kicked
off
his
shoes
and
shed
his
and
furiously
for
a
whisky
and
soda
and
lunch
his
physical
restoration
was
accompanied
by
a
quickening
of
dismay
at
the
general
prospect
what
to
put
it
succinctly
was
life
worth
even
when
unharassed
by
allusions
to
duels
without
the
solace
of
golf
quarrels
and
diaries
in
the
companionship
of
puffin
he
hated
puffin
no
one
more
so
but
he
could
not
possibly
get
on
without
him
and
it
was
entirely
due
to
puffin
that
he
had
spent
so
outrageous
a
morning
for
puffin
seeking
to
silence
miss
mapp
by
his
intoxicated
bargain
had
been
the
prime
cause
of
all
this
misery
he
could
not
even
for
fear
of
that
eye
in
miss
mapp
go
across
to
the
house
of
the
unforgiven
and
by
a
judicious
recital
of
his
woes
induce
him
to
beg
miss
mapp
forgiveness
instantly
he
would
have
to
wait
till
the
kindly
darkness
fell
mere
slavery
he
exclaimed
with
passion
a
tap
at
his
door
interrupted
the
chain
of
these
melancholy
reflections
and
his
permission
to
enter
was
responded
to
by
puffin
himself
the
major
bounced
from
his
seat
you
must
stop
here
he
said
in
a
low
voice
as
if
afraid
that
he
might
be
overheard
miss
mapp
may
have
seen
you
come
in
puffin
laughed
shrilly
why
of
course
she
did
he
gaily
assented
she
was
at
her
window
all
right
ancient
lights
i
shall
call
her
what
this
all
about
now
you
must
go
back
said
major
flint
agitatedly
she
must
see
you
go
back
i
ca
explain
now
but
i
come
across
after
dinner
when
dark
go
do
wait
he
positively
hustled
the
mystified
puffin
out
of
the
house
and
miss
mapp
face
which
had
grown
sharp
and
pointed
with
doubts
and
suspicions
when
she
observed
him
enter
major
benjy
house
dimpled
as
she
saw
him
return
into
her
sunniest
smiles
dear
major
benjy
she
said
he
has
refused
to
see
him
and
she
cut
the
string
of
the
large
cardboard
box
which
had
just
arrived
from
the
dyer
with
the
most
pleasurable
anticipations
well
it
was
certainly
very
magnificent
and
miss
greele
was
quite
right
for
there
was
not
the
faintest
tinge
to
show
that
it
had
originally
been
she
had
not
quite
realized
how
brilliant
was
in
the
piece
it
seemed
almost
to
cast
a
ruddy
glow
on
the
very
ceiling
and
the
fact
that
she
had
caused
the
orange
chiffon
with
which
the
neck
and
sleeves
were
trimmed
to
be
dyed
black
following
the
exquisite
taste
of
titus
trout
only
threw
the
splendour
of
the
rest
into
more
dazzling
radiance
would
appear
quite
ghostly
and
in
its
neighbourhood
and
painful
though
that
would
be
for
diva
it
would
as
all
her
must
hope
be
a
lesson
to
her
not
to
indulge
in
such
garishness
she
should
be
taught
her
lesson
thought
miss
mapp
at
susan
evening
captain
puffin
was
being
taught
a
lesson
too
for
we
are
never
too
old
to
learn
or
for
that
matter
to
teach
though
the
night
was
dark
and
moonless
there
was
an
inconveniently
brilliant
close
to
the
major
door
and
that
strategist
carrying
his
round
roll
of
diaries
much
the
shape
of
a
bottle
under
his
coat
went
about
nine
that
evening
to
look
at
the
which
had
been
weeping
into
his
yard
and
let
himself
out
of
the
round
the
corner
from
there
he
went
down
past
the
fishmonger
crossed
the
road
and
doubled
back
again
up
puffin
side
of
the
street
which
was
not
so
vividly
illuminated
though
he
took
the
precaution
of
making
himself
little
with
bent
knees
and
of
limping
puffin
was
already
warming
himself
over
the
fire
and
imbibing
roman
roads
and
was
disposed
to
be
hilarious
over
the
major
shopping
but
why
and
major
he
asked
another
visit
of
the
prince
of
wales
i
asked
myself
or
the
voice
that
breathed
eden
have
a
drink
one
of
mine
i
mean
i
owe
you
a
drink
for
the
good
laugh
you
gave
me
had
it
not
been
for
this
generosity
and
the
need
of
getting
on
the
right
side
of
puffin
major
flint
would
certainly
have
resented
such
clumsy
levity
but
this
double
consideration
caused
him
to
take
it
with
unwonted
his
attempt
to
laugh
indeed
sounded
a
little
hollow
but
that
is
the
habit
of
merriment
well
i
allow
it
must
have
seemed
amusing
he
said
the
fact
was
that
i
thought
she
would
appreciate
my
putting
a
little
ceremony
into
my
errand
of
apology
and
then
she
whisked
me
off
shopping
before
i
could
go
and
change
kiss
and
friends
again
then
asked
puffin
the
major
grew
a
little
stately
over
this
no
such
familiarity
passed
he
said
but
she
accepted
my
regrets
with
ha
the
most
gracious
generosity
a
woman
sir
you
find
the
same
i
might
if
i
looked
for
it
said
puffin
but
why
should
i
want
to
make
it
up
you
done
that
and
that
prevents
her
talking
about
duelling
and
early
trains
she
ca
mock
at
me
because
of
you
you
might
pass
me
back
my
bottle
if
you
taken
your
drink
the
major
reluctantly
did
so
you
must
please
yourself
old
boy
he
said
it
your
business
and
no
one
ever
said
that
benjy
flint
interfered
in
another
man
affairs
but
i
trust
you
will
do
what
good
feeling
indicates
i
hope
you
value
our
jolly
games
of
golf
and
our
pleasant
evenings
sufficiently
highly
eh
how
that
asked
puffin
you
going
to
cut
me
too
the
major
sat
down
and
put
his
large
feet
on
the
fender
tact
and
diplomacy
benjy
my
boy
he
reminded
himself
ha
that
what
i
like
he
said
a
good
fire
and
a
friend
and
the
rest
of
the
world
may
go
hang
there
no
question
of
cutting
old
man
i
need
tell
you
that
but
we
must
have
one
of
our
good
talks
for
instance
i
very
unceremoniously
turned
you
out
of
my
house
this
afternoon
and
i
owe
you
an
explanation
of
that
i
give
it
you
in
one
word
miss
mapp
saw
you
come
in
she
did
see
me
come
in
here
this
evening
ha
ha
and
that
why
i
can
sit
at
my
ease
but
if
she
knew
puffin
guessed
what
has
happened
major
is
that
you
thrown
me
over
for
miss
mapp
he
observed
no
sir
i
have
not
said
the
major
with
emphasis
should
i
be
sitting
here
and
drinking
your
whisky
if
i
had
but
this
morning
after
that
lady
had
accepted
my
regret
for
my
share
in
what
occurred
the
other
night
she
assumed
that
since
i
condemned
my
own
conduct
unreservedly
i
must
equally
condemn
yours
it
really
was
like
a
conjuring
trick
the
thing
was
done
before
i
knew
anything
about
it
and
before
i
had
time
to
say
on
a
bit
i
was
being
led
up
and
down
the
high
street
carrying
as
much
merchandise
as
a
drove
of
camels
god
sir
i
suffered
this
morning
you
do
seem
to
realize
that
i
suffered
i
stand
any
more
mornings
like
that
i
have
the
stamina
a
powerful
woman
said
puffin
reflectively
you
may
well
say
that
observed
major
flint
that
is
finely
said
a
powerful
woman
she
is
with
a
powerful
tongue
and
able
to
be
powerful
nasty
and
if
she
sees
you
and
me
on
friendly
terms
again
she
turn
the
full
hose
on
to
us
both
unless
you
make
it
up
with
her
h
yes
but
as
likely
as
not
she
tell
me
and
my
apologies
to
go
hang
have
a
try
old
man
said
the
major
encouragingly
puffin
looked
at
his
help
yourself
major
he
said
i
think
you
have
to
help
me
out
you
know
go
and
interview
her
see
if
there
a
chance
of
my
favourable
reception
no
sir
said
the
major
firmly
i
will
not
run
the
risk
of
another
morning
shopping
in
the
high
street
you
need
watch
till
she
comes
back
from
her
shopping
major
benjy
clearly
did
not
like
the
prospect
at
all
but
puffin
grew
firmer
and
firmer
in
his
absolute
refusal
to
lay
himself
open
to
rebuff
and
presently
they
came
to
an
agreement
that
the
major
was
to
go
on
his
ambassadorial
errand
next
morning
that
being
settled
the
still
undecided
point
about
the
gave
rise
to
a
good
deal
of
heat
until
it
being
discovered
that
the
window
was
open
and
that
their
voices
might
easily
carry
as
far
as
the
they
made
malignant
rejoinders
to
each
other
in
whispers
but
it
was
impossible
to
go
on
quarrelling
for
long
in
so
confidential
a
manner
and
the
disagreement
was
deferred
to
a
more
convenient
occasion
it
was
late
when
the
major
left
and
after
putting
out
the
light
in
puffin
hall
so
that
he
should
not
be
silhouetted
against
it
he
slid
into
the
darkness
and
reached
his
own
door
by
a
subtle
detour
miss
mapp
had
a
good
deal
of
division
of
her
swift
mind
when
next
morning
she
learned
the
nature
of
major
benjy
second
errand
if
she
like
wyse
was
to
encourage
puffin
to
hope
that
she
would
accept
his
apologies
she
would
be
obliged
to
remit
all
further
punishment
of
him
and
allow
him
to
consort
with
his
friend
again
it
was
difficult
to
forgo
the
pleasure
of
his
chastisement
but
on
the
other
hand
it
was
just
possible
that
the
major
might
break
away
and
whether
she
liked
it
or
not
and
she
would
not
refuse
permanently
to
give
up
society
that
would
be
awkward
since
she
had
publicly
paraded
her
reconciliation
with
him
what
further
inclined
her
to
clemency
was
that
this
very
evening
the
would
shed
its
effulgence
over
poppit
and
diva
would
never
want
to
hear
the
word
kingfisher
again
that
was
enough
to
put
anybody
in
a
good
temper
so
the
diplomatist
returned
to
the
miscreant
with
the
glad
tidings
that
miss
mapp
would
hear
his
supplication
with
a
favourable
ear
and
she
took
up
a
stately
position
in
the
which
she
selected
as
audience
chamber
near
the
bell
so
that
she
could
ring
for
withers
if
necessary
miss
mapp
mercy
was
largely
tempered
with
justice
and
she
proposed
in
spite
of
the
leniency
which
she
would
eventually
exhibit
to
give
puffin
what
for
first
she
had
not
for
him
as
for
major
benjy
that
feminine
weakness
which
had
made
it
a
positive
luxury
to
forgive
him
she
never
even
thought
of
puffin
as
captain
dicky
far
less
let
the
pretty
endearment
slip
off
her
tongue
accidentally
and
the
luxury
which
she
anticipated
from
the
interview
was
that
of
administering
a
quantity
of
hard
slaps
she
had
appointed
twelve
as
the
hour
for
his
suffering
so
that
he
must
go
without
his
golf
again
she
put
down
the
book
she
was
reading
when
he
appeared
and
gazed
at
him
stonily
without
speech
he
limped
into
the
middle
of
the
room
this
might
be
forgiveness
but
it
did
not
look
like
it
and
he
wondered
whether
she
had
got
him
here
on
false
pretences
good
morning
said
he
miss
mapp
inclined
her
head
silence
was
gold
i
understood
from
major
flint
began
puffin
speech
could
be
gold
too
if
said
miss
mapp
you
have
come
to
speak
about
major
flint
you
have
wasted
your
time
and
mine
how
different
from
major
benjy
she
thought
what
a
shrimp
the
shrimp
gave
a
slight
gasp
the
thing
had
got
to
be
done
and
the
sooner
he
was
out
of
range
of
this
powerful
woman
the
better
i
am
extremely
sorry
for
what
i
said
to
you
the
other
night
he
said
i
am
glad
you
are
sorry
said
miss
mapp
i
offer
you
my
apologies
for
what
i
said
continued
puffin
the
whip
whistled
when
you
spoke
to
me
on
the
occasion
to
which
you
refer
said
miss
mapp
i
saw
of
course
at
once
that
you
were
not
in
a
condition
to
speak
to
anybody
i
instantly
did
you
that
justice
for
i
am
just
to
everybody
i
paid
no
more
attention
to
what
you
said
than
i
should
have
paid
to
any
tipsy
vagabond
in
the
slums
i
daresay
you
hardly
remember
what
you
said
so
that
before
i
hear
your
expression
of
regret
i
will
remind
you
of
it
you
threatened
unless
i
promised
to
tell
nobody
in
what
a
disgusting
condition
you
were
to
say
that
i
was
tipsy
elizabeth
mapp
tipsy
that
was
what
you
said
captain
puffin
captain
puffin
turned
extremely
red
now
the
shrimp
being
boiled
thought
miss
mapp
i
ca
do
more
than
apologize
said
he
he
did
not
know
whether
he
was
angrier
with
his
ambassador
or
her
did
you
say
you
could
do
said
miss
mapp
with
an
air
of
great
interest
how
curious
i
should
have
thought
you
could
have
done
less
well
what
more
can
i
do
asked
he
if
you
think
said
miss
mapp
that
you
hurt
me
by
your
conduct
that
night
you
are
vastly
mistaken
and
if
you
think
you
can
do
no
more
than
apologize
i
will
teach
you
better
you
can
make
an
effort
captain
puffin
to
break
with
your
deplorable
habits
to
try
to
get
back
a
little
of
the
if
you
ever
had
any
which
you
have
lost
you
can
cease
trying
oh
so
unsuccessfully
to
drag
major
benjy
down
to
your
level
that
what
you
can
do
she
let
these
withering
observations
blight
him
i
accept
your
apologies
she
said
i
hope
you
will
do
better
in
the
future
captain
puffin
and
i
shall
look
anxiously
for
signs
of
improvement
we
will
meet
with
politeness
and
friendliness
when
we
are
brought
together
and
i
will
do
my
best
to
wipe
all
remembrance
of
your
tipsy
impertinence
from
my
mind
and
you
must
do
your
best
too
you
are
not
young
and
engrained
habits
are
difficult
to
get
rid
of
but
do
not
despair
captain
puffin
and
now
i
will
ring
for
withers
and
she
will
show
you
out
she
rang
the
bell
and
gave
a
sample
of
her
generous
oblivion
and
we
meet
do
we
not
this
evening
at
mrs
poppit
she
said
looking
not
at
him
but
about
a
foot
above
his
head
such
pleasant
evenings
one
always
has
there
i
hope
it
will
not
be
a
wet
evening
but
the
glass
is
sadly
down
oh
withers
captain
puffin
is
going
good
morning
captain
puffin
such
a
pleasure
miss
mapp
hummed
a
rollicking
little
tune
as
she
observed
him
totter
down
the
street
there
she
said
and
had
a
glass
of
burgundy
for
lunch
as
a
treat
chapter
x
the
news
that
wyse
was
to
be
of
the
party
that
evening
at
poppit
and
was
to
dine
there
first
as
he
casually
let
slip
in
order
to
air
his
french
created
a
disagreeable
impression
that
afternoon
in
tilling
it
was
not
usual
to
do
anything
more
than
have
a
tray
for
your
evening
meal
if
one
of
these
winter
followed
and
there
was
to
miss
mapp
mind
a
deplorable
tendency
to
ostentation
in
this
before
a
party
still
if
susan
was
determined
to
be
extravagant
she
might
have
asked
miss
mapp
as
well
who
resented
this
want
of
hospitality
she
did
not
like
either
this
work
with
wyse
it
indicated
a
pushing
familiarity
to
which
it
was
hoped
wyse
eyes
were
open
there
was
another
point
the
party
it
had
been
ascertained
would
in
all
number
ten
and
if
as
was
certain
there
would
be
two
that
seemed
to
imply
that
two
people
would
have
to
cut
out
there
were
often
nine
at
poppit
she
appeared
to
be
unable
to
count
but
on
those
occasions
isabel
was
generally
told
by
her
mother
that
she
did
not
care
for
bridge
and
so
there
was
no
cutting
out
but
only
a
pleasant
book
for
isabel
but
what
would
be
done
with
ten
it
was
idle
to
hope
that
susan
would
sit
out
as
hostess
she
always
considered
it
part
of
her
duties
to
play
solidly
the
entire
evening
still
if
the
cutting
of
cards
malignantly
ordained
that
miss
mapp
was
ejected
it
was
only
reasonable
to
expect
that
after
her
magnanimity
to
the
united
services
either
major
benjy
or
captain
puffin
would
be
so
obdurate
in
his
insistence
that
she
must
play
instead
of
him
that
it
would
be
only
ladylike
to
yield
she
did
not
therefore
allow
this
possibility
to
dim
the
pleasure
she
anticipated
from
the
discomfiture
of
darling
diva
who
would
be
certain
to
appear
in
the
and
find
herself
ghastly
and
outshone
by
the
which
was
the
colour
of
trout
second
toilet
and
miss
mapp
after
prolonged
thought
as
to
her
most
dramatic
moment
of
entrance
in
the
determined
to
arrive
when
she
might
expect
the
rest
of
the
guests
to
have
already
assembled
she
would
risk
it
is
true
being
out
of
a
rubber
for
a
little
since
bridge
might
have
already
begun
but
play
would
have
to
stop
for
a
minute
of
greetings
when
she
came
in
and
she
would
beg
everybody
not
to
stir
and
would
seat
herself
quite
quite
close
to
diva
and
openly
admire
her
pretty
frock
like
one
i
used
to
have
it
was
therefore
not
much
lacking
of
ten
when
after
she
had
waited
a
considerable
time
on
poppit
threshold
boon
sulkily
allowed
her
to
enter
but
gave
no
answer
to
her
timid
inquiry
of
am
i
very
late
boon
the
door
was
a
little
ajar
and
as
she
took
off
the
cloak
that
masked
the
splendour
of
the
her
acute
ears
heard
the
murmur
of
talk
going
on
which
indicated
that
bridge
had
not
yet
begun
while
her
acute
nostrils
detected
the
faint
but
certain
smell
of
roast
grouse
which
showed
what
susan
had
given
wyse
for
dinner
probably
telling
him
that
the
birds
were
a
present
to
her
from
the
where
she
had
stayed
in
the
summer
then
after
she
had
thrown
herself
a
glance
in
the
mirror
and
put
on
her
smile
boon
preceded
her
slightly
shrugging
his
shoulders
to
the
door
which
he
pushed
open
and
grunted
loudly
which
was
his
manner
of
announcing
a
guest
miss
mapp
went
tripping
in
almost
at
a
run
to
indicate
how
vexed
she
was
with
herself
for
being
late
and
there
just
in
front
of
her
stood
diva
dressed
not
in
at
all
but
in
the
of
trout
second
toilet
perfidious
diva
had
had
her
dress
dyed
too
miss
mapp
courage
rose
to
the
occasion
other
people
majors
and
tipsy
captains
might
be
cowards
but
not
she
twice
now
omitting
the
matter
of
the
wars
of
the
roses
had
diva
by
some
cunning
which
it
was
impossible
not
to
suspect
of
a
diabolical
origin
clad
her
odious
little
roundabout
form
in
splendours
identical
with
miss
mapp
but
now
without
faltering
even
when
she
heard
evie
loud
squeak
she
turned
to
her
hostess
who
wore
the
order
of
on
her
ample
breast
and
made
her
salutations
in
a
perfectly
calm
voice
dear
susan
do
scold
me
for
being
so
late
she
said
though
i
know
i
deserve
it
so
sweet
of
you
isabel
darling
and
dear
evie
oh
and
wyse
sweet
irene
major
benjy
and
captain
puffin
had
a
nice
game
of
golf
and
the
padre
she
hesitated
a
moment
wondering
if
she
could
without
screaming
or
scratching
seem
aware
of
diva
presence
then
she
soared
lambent
as
flame
diva
darling
she
said
and
bent
and
kissed
her
even
as
stephen
in
the
moment
of
martyrdom
prayed
for
those
who
stoned
him
flesh
and
blood
could
not
manage
more
and
she
turned
to
wyse
remembering
that
diva
had
told
her
that
the
contessa
faradiddleony
arrival
was
postponed
and
your
dear
sister
has
put
off
her
journey
i
understand
she
said
such
a
disappointment
shall
we
see
her
at
tilling
at
all
do
you
think
wyse
looked
surprised
dear
lady
he
said
you
the
second
person
who
has
said
that
to
me
plaistow
asked
me
just
now
yes
it
was
she
who
told
me
said
miss
mapp
in
case
there
was
a
mistake
is
it
true
certainly
not
i
told
my
housekeeper
that
the
contessa
maid
was
ill
and
would
follow
her
but
that
the
only
foundation
i
know
of
for
this
rumour
amelia
encourages
me
to
hope
that
she
will
be
here
early
next
week
oh
no
doubt
that
it
said
miss
mapp
in
an
aside
so
that
diva
could
hear
darling
diva
always
getting
hold
of
the
most
erroneous
information
she
must
have
been
listening
to
servants
gossip
so
glad
she
wrong
about
it
wyse
made
one
of
his
stately
inclinations
of
the
head
amelia
will
regret
very
much
not
being
here
he
said
for
i
see
all
the
great
are
present
oh
mr
wyse
said
she
we
shall
all
be
humble
learners
compared
with
the
contessa
i
expect
not
at
all
said
wyse
but
what
a
delightful
idea
of
yours
and
plaistow
to
dress
alike
in
such
lovely
gowns
quite
like
sisters
miss
mapp
could
not
trust
herself
to
speak
on
this
subject
and
showed
all
her
teeth
not
snarling
but
amazingly
smiling
she
had
no
occasion
to
reply
however
for
captain
puffin
joined
them
eagerly
deferential
what
a
charming
surprise
you
and
plaistow
have
given
us
miss
mapp
he
said
in
appearing
again
in
the
same
beautiful
dresses
quite
like
miss
mapp
could
not
bear
to
hear
what
she
and
diva
were
like
and
wheeled
about
passionately
regretting
that
she
had
forgiven
puffin
this
manoeuvre
brought
her
face
to
face
with
the
major
upon
my
word
miss
elizabeth
he
said
you
look
magnificent
he
saw
the
light
of
fury
in
her
eyes
and
guessed
mere
man
as
he
was
what
it
was
about
he
bent
to
her
and
spoke
low
but
by
jove
he
said
with
supreme
diplomacy
somebody
ought
to
tell
our
good
plaistow
that
some
women
can
wear
a
wonderful
gown
and
others
ha
dear
major
benjy
said
she
cruel
of
you
to
poor
diva
but
instantly
her
happiness
was
clouded
again
for
the
padre
had
a
very
notion
what
ho
fair
madam
plaistow
he
humorously
observed
to
miss
mapp
ah
peccavi
i
am
in
error
it
is
mistress
mapp
but
let
us
to
the
cards
our
hostess
craves
thy
presence
at
yon
table
contrary
to
custom
poppit
did
not
sit
firmly
down
at
a
table
nor
was
isabel
told
that
she
had
an
invincible
objection
to
playing
bridge
instead
she
bade
everybody
else
take
their
seats
and
said
that
she
and
wyse
had
settled
at
dinner
that
they
much
preferred
looking
on
and
learning
to
playing
with
a
view
to
enjoying
this
incredible
treat
as
fully
as
possible
they
at
once
seated
themselves
on
a
low
sofa
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
where
they
could
not
look
or
learn
at
all
and
engaged
in
conversation
diva
and
elizabeth
as
might
have
been
expected
from
the
malignant
influence
which
watched
over
their
attire
cut
in
at
the
same
table
and
were
partners
so
that
they
had
in
spite
of
the
deadly
antagonism
of
identical
a
financial
interest
in
common
while
a
further
bond
between
them
was
the
eagerness
with
which
they
strained
their
ears
to
overhear
anything
that
their
hostess
and
wyse
were
saying
to
each
other
miss
mapp
and
diva
alike
were
perhaps
busier
when
they
were
being
dummy
than
when
they
were
playing
the
cards
over
the
background
of
each
mind
was
spread
a
hatred
of
the
other
red
as
their
and
shot
with
black
despair
as
to
what
on
earth
they
should
do
now
with
those
pieces
of
pride
miss
mapp
was
prepared
to
make
a
perfect
chameleon
of
hers
if
only
she
could
get
away
from
diva
hue
but
what
if
having
changed
say
to
purple
diva
became
purple
too
she
could
not
stand
a
third
coincidence
and
besides
she
much
doubted
whether
any
gown
that
had
once
been
of
so
pronounced
a
could
successfully
attempt
to
appear
of
any
other
hue
except
perhaps
black
if
diva
died
she
might
perhaps
consult
miss
greele
as
to
whether
black
would
be
possible
but
then
if
diva
died
there
was
no
reason
for
not
wearing
for
ever
since
it
would
be
an
insincerity
of
which
miss
mapp
humbly
hoped
she
was
incapable
to
go
into
mourning
for
diva
just
because
she
died
in
front
of
this
lurid
background
of
despair
moved
the
figures
which
would
have
commanded
all
her
attention
have
aroused
all
the
feelings
of
disgust
and
pity
of
which
she
was
capable
had
only
diva
stuck
to
there
they
sat
on
the
sofa
talking
in
voices
which
it
was
impossible
to
overhear
and
if
ever
a
woman
made
up
to
a
man
and
if
ever
a
man
was
taken
in
by
shallow
artifices
they
thought
miss
mapp
are
the
ones
there
was
no
longer
any
question
that
susan
was
doing
her
utmost
to
inveigle
wyse
into
matrimony
for
no
other
motive
not
politeness
not
the
charm
of
conversation
not
the
low
comfortable
seat
by
the
fire
could
possibly
have
had
force
enough
to
keep
her
for
a
whole
evening
from
the
that
dinner
so
miss
mapp
sarcastically
reflected
what
if
it
was
the
first
of
hundreds
of
similar
dinners
perhaps
when
safely
married
susan
would
ask
her
to
one
of
the
family
dinners
with
a
glassful
of
foam
which
she
called
champagne
and
the
leg
of
a
crow
which
she
called
game
from
the
there
was
no
use
in
denying
that
wyse
seemed
to
be
swallowing
flattery
and
any
other
form
of
bait
as
fast
as
they
were
supplied
him
never
had
he
been
so
made
up
to
since
the
day
now
two
years
ago
when
miss
mapp
herself
wrote
him
down
as
uncapturable
but
now
on
this
awful
evening
of
it
seemed
only
prudent
to
face
the
prospect
of
his
falling
into
the
nets
which
were
spread
for
him
susan
the
of
a
contessa
susan
the
wife
of
the
man
whose
urbanity
made
all
tilling
polite
to
each
other
susan
a
wyse
of
whitchurch
it
made
miss
mapp
feel
positively
weary
of
earth
nor
was
this
the
sum
of
miss
mapp
mental
activities
as
she
sat
being
dummy
to
diva
for
in
addition
to
the
rage
despair
and
disgust
with
which
these
various
topics
filled
her
she
had
narrowly
to
watch
play
in
order
at
the
end
to
point
out
to
her
with
lucid
firmness
all
the
mistakes
she
had
made
while
with
snorts
and
sniffs
and
muttered
exclamations
and
jerks
of
the
head
and
of
cards
and
puttings
of
them
back
with
amazing
assertions
that
she
had
not
quitted
them
she
wrestled
with
the
task
she
had
set
herself
of
getting
two
it
was
impossible
to
count
the
tricks
that
diva
made
for
she
had
a
habit
of
putting
her
elbow
on
them
after
she
had
raked
them
in
as
if
in
fear
that
her
adversaries
would
filch
them
when
she
was
not
looking
and
miss
mapp
distracted
with
other
interests
forgot
that
had
been
declared
and
thought
it
was
hearts
of
which
diva
played
several
after
their
adversaries
hands
were
quite
denuded
of
them
she
often
did
that
to
make
sure
three
tricks
she
said
triumphantly
at
the
conclusion
counting
the
cards
in
the
cache
below
her
elbow
miss
mapp
gave
a
long
sigh
but
remembered
that
wyse
was
present
you
could
have
got
two
more
she
said
if
you
had
played
those
hearts
dear
you
would
have
been
able
to
trump
major
benjy
club
and
the
padre
diamond
and
we
should
have
gone
out
never
mind
you
played
it
beautifully
otherwise
ca
trump
when
it
no
trumps
said
diva
forgetting
that
wyse
was
there
that
nonsense
got
three
tricks
did
go
out
did
you
think
it
was
hearts
was
miss
mapp
naturally
could
not
demean
herself
to
take
any
notice
of
this
your
deal
is
it
major
benjy
she
asked
me
to
cut
diva
had
remembered
just
after
her
sharp
speech
to
her
partner
that
wyse
was
present
and
looked
towards
the
sofa
to
see
if
there
were
any
indications
of
pained
surprise
on
his
face
which
might
indicate
that
he
had
heard
but
what
she
saw
there
or
to
be
more
accurate
what
she
failed
to
see
there
forced
her
to
give
an
exclamation
which
caused
miss
mapp
to
look
round
in
the
direction
where
diva
bulging
eyes
were
glued
there
was
no
doubt
whatever
about
it
poppit
and
wyse
were
no
longer
there
unless
they
were
under
the
sofa
they
had
certainly
left
the
room
together
and
altogether
had
she
gone
to
put
on
her
sable
coat
on
this
hot
night
was
wyse
staggering
under
its
weight
as
he
fitted
her
into
it
miss
mapp
rejected
the
supposition
they
had
gone
to
another
room
to
converse
more
privately
this
looked
very
black
indeed
and
she
noted
the
time
on
the
clock
in
order
to
ascertain
when
they
came
back
how
long
they
had
been
absent
the
rubber
went
on
its
wild
way
relieved
from
the
restraining
influence
of
wyse
and
when
minutes
afterwards
it
came
to
its
conclusion
and
neither
the
hostess
nor
wyse
had
returned
miss
mapp
was
content
to
let
diva
muddle
herself
madly
adding
up
the
score
with
the
assistance
of
her
fingers
and
went
across
to
the
other
table
till
she
should
be
called
back
to
check
her
partner
figures
they
would
be
certain
to
need
checking
has
wyse
gone
away
already
dear
isabel
she
said
how
early
and
four
makes
nine
muttered
diva
getting
to
her
little
finger
isabel
was
dummy
and
had
time
for
conversation
i
think
he
has
only
gone
with
mamma
into
the
conservatory
she
said
no
more
diamonds
partner
to
advise
her
about
the
orchids
now
the
conservatory
was
what
miss
mapp
considered
a
with
a
glass
roof
and
the
orchids
were
one
anæmic
odontoglossum
and
there
would
scarcely
be
room
besides
that
for
poppit
and
wyse
the
was
visible
from
the
window
over
which
curtains
were
drawn
such
a
lovely
night
said
miss
mapp
and
while
diva
is
checking
the
score
may
i
have
a
peep
at
the
stars
dear
so
fond
of
the
sweet
stars
she
glided
to
the
window
conscious
that
diva
was
longing
to
glide
too
but
was
preparing
to
quarrel
with
the
major
score
and
took
her
peep
at
the
sweet
stars
the
light
from
the
hall
shone
full
into
the
but
there
was
nobody
there
she
made
quite
sure
of
that
diva
had
heard
about
the
sweet
stars
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
made
no
objection
to
her
adversaries
total
you
right
major
flint
she
said
stupid
of
me
i
left
my
handkerchief
in
the
pocket
of
my
cloak
i
pop
out
and
get
it
back
in
a
minute
cut
again
for
partners
she
trundled
to
the
door
and
popped
out
of
it
before
miss
mapp
had
the
slightest
chance
of
intercepting
her
progress
this
was
bitter
because
the
opened
out
of
the
hall
and
so
did
the
with
a
window
which
dear
susan
called
her
boudoir
diva
was
quite
capable
of
popping
into
both
of
these
apartments
in
fact
if
the
truants
were
there
it
was
no
use
bothering
about
the
sweet
stars
any
more
and
diva
would
already
have
won
there
was
a
sweet
moon
as
well
and
just
as
baffled
miss
mapp
was
turning
away
from
the
window
she
saw
that
which
made
her
positively
glue
her
nose
to
the
cold
and
tuck
the
curtain
in
so
that
her
silhouette
should
not
be
visible
from
outside
down
the
middle
of
the
garden
path
came
the
two
truants
susan
in
her
sables
and
wyse
close
beside
her
with
his
turned
up
her
ample
form
with
the
small
round
head
on
the
top
looked
like
a
locomotive
engine
and
he
like
the
driver
on
the
the
perfidious
things
had
said
they
were
going
to
consult
over
the
orchid
did
orchids
grow
on
the
lawn
it
was
news
to
miss
mapp
if
they
did
they
stopped
and
wyse
quite
clearly
pointed
to
some
celestial
object
moon
or
star
and
they
both
gazed
at
it
the
sight
of
two
such
people
behaving
like
this
made
miss
mapp
feel
quite
sick
but
she
heroically
continued
a
moment
more
at
her
post
her
heroism
was
rewarded
for
immediately
after
the
inspection
of
the
celestial
object
they
turned
and
inspected
each
other
and
wyse
kissed
her
miss
mapp
scriggled
from
behind
the
curtain
into
the
room
again
aldebaran
she
said
so
lovely
simultaneously
diva
with
her
handkerchief
thwarted
and
disappointed
for
she
had
certainly
found
nobody
either
in
the
boudoir
or
in
the
but
there
was
going
to
be
a
supper
and
as
boon
was
not
there
she
had
taken
a
miss
mapp
was
flushed
with
excitement
and
disgust
and
almost
forgot
about
diva
gown
found
your
hanky
dear
she
said
then
shall
we
cut
for
partners
again
you
and
me
major
benjy
do
scold
me
if
i
play
wrong
she
managed
to
get
a
seat
that
commanded
a
view
of
the
door
for
the
next
thing
was
to
see
how
the
young
couple
as
she
had
already
labelled
them
in
her
sarcastic
mind
looked
when
they
returned
from
their
amorous
excursion
to
the
orchid
that
grew
on
the
lawn
they
entered
most
unfortunately
while
she
was
in
the
middle
of
playing
a
complicated
hand
and
her
brain
was
so
switched
off
from
the
play
by
their
entrance
that
she
completely
lost
the
thread
of
what
she
was
doing
and
threw
away
two
tricks
that
simply
required
to
be
gathered
up
by
her
but
now
lurked
below
diva
elbow
what
made
it
worse
was
that
no
trace
of
emotion
no
heightened
colour
no
coy
and
downcast
eye
betrayed
a
hint
of
what
had
happened
on
the
lawn
with
brazen
effrontery
susan
informed
her
daughter
that
wyse
thought
a
little
what
a
liar
thought
miss
mapp
and
triumphantly
put
her
remaining
trump
on
to
her
dummy
best
card
then
she
prepared
to
make
the
best
of
it
we
lost
three
i
afraid
major
benjy
she
said
do
you
think
you
overbid
your
hand
just
a
little
wee
bit
i
do
know
about
that
miss
elizabeth
said
the
major
if
you
had
let
those
two
spades
go
and
had
trumped
my
best
heart
miss
mapp
interrupted
with
her
famous
patter
oh
but
if
i
had
taken
the
spades
she
said
quickly
i
should
have
had
to
lead
up
to
diva
clubs
and
then
they
would
have
got
the
rough
in
diamonds
and
i
should
have
never
been
able
to
get
back
into
your
hand
again
then
at
the
end
if
i
had
trumped
your
heart
i
should
have
had
to
lead
the
losing
spade
and
diva
would
have
and
brought
in
her
club
and
we
should
have
gone
down
two
more
if
you
follow
me
i
think
you
agree
that
i
was
right
to
do
that
but
all
good
players
overbid
their
hands
sometimes
major
benjy
such
fun
the
supper
was
unusually
ostentatious
but
miss
mapp
saw
the
reason
for
that
it
was
clear
that
susan
wanted
to
impress
poor
wyse
with
her
wealth
and
probably
when
it
came
to
settlements
he
would
learn
some
very
unpleasant
news
but
there
were
agreeable
little
circumstances
to
temper
her
dislike
of
this
extravagant
display
for
she
was
hungry
and
diva
always
a
gross
feeder
spilt
some
hot
chocolate
sauce
on
the
which
if
indelible
might
supply
a
solution
to
the
problem
of
what
was
to
be
done
now
about
her
own
frock
she
kept
an
eye
too
on
captain
puffin
to
see
if
he
showed
any
signs
of
improvement
in
the
direction
she
had
indicated
to
him
in
her
interview
and
was
rejoiced
to
see
that
one
of
these
glances
was
clearly
the
cause
of
his
refusing
a
second
glass
of
port
he
had
already
taken
the
stopper
out
of
the
decanter
when
their
eyes
met
and
then
he
put
it
back
again
improvement
already
everything
else
pending
the
discovery
as
to
whether
chocolate
on
spelt
ruin
now
faded
into
a
middle
distance
while
the
affairs
of
susan
and
poor
wyse
occupied
the
entire
foreground
of
miss
mapp
consciousness
mean
and
cunning
as
susan
conduct
must
have
been
in
entrapping
wyse
when
others
had
failed
to
gain
his
affection
miss
mapp
felt
that
it
would
be
only
prudent
to
continue
on
the
most
amicable
of
terms
with
her
for
as
future
to
a
countess
and
wife
to
the
man
who
by
the
mere
exercise
of
his
presence
could
make
tilling
sit
up
and
behave
she
would
doubtless
not
hesitate
about
giving
miss
mapp
some
nasty
ones
back
if
retaliation
demanded
it
was
dreadful
to
think
that
this
audacious
climber
was
so
soon
to
belong
to
the
wyses
of
whitchurch
but
since
the
moonlight
had
revealed
that
such
was
wyse
intention
it
was
best
to
be
friends
with
the
mammon
of
the
british
empire
was
likely
to
be
a
very
important
centre
of
social
life
in
tilling
when
not
in
scotland
or
whitchurch
or
capri
and
miss
mapp
wisely
determined
that
even
the
announcement
of
the
engagement
should
not
induce
her
to
give
voice
to
the
very
proper
sentiments
which
it
could
not
help
inspiring
after
all
she
had
done
for
susan
in
letting
the
door
of
in
tilling
swing
open
for
her
when
she
could
not
possibly
keep
it
shut
any
longer
it
seemed
only
natural
that
if
she
only
kept
on
good
terms
with
her
now
susan
would
insist
that
her
dear
elizabeth
must
be
the
first
to
be
told
of
the
engagement
this
made
her
pause
before
adopting
the
obvious
course
of
setting
off
immediately
after
breakfast
next
morning
and
telling
all
her
friends
under
promise
of
secrecy
just
what
she
had
seen
in
the
moonlight
last
night
thrilling
to
the
narrator
as
such
an
announcement
would
be
it
would
be
even
more
thrilling
provided
only
that
susan
had
sufficient
sense
of
decency
to
tell
her
of
the
engagement
before
anybody
else
to
hurry
off
to
all
the
others
and
inform
them
that
she
had
known
of
it
ever
since
the
night
of
the
it
was
important
therefore
to
be
at
home
whenever
there
was
the
slightest
chance
of
susan
coming
round
with
her
news
and
miss
mapp
sat
at
her
window
the
whole
of
that
first
morning
so
as
not
to
miss
her
and
hardly
attended
at
all
to
the
rest
of
the
pageant
of
life
that
moved
within
the
radius
of
her
observation
her
heart
beat
fast
when
about
the
middle
of
the
morning
wyse
came
round
the
dentist
corner
for
it
might
be
that
the
bashful
susan
had
sent
him
to
make
the
announcement
but
if
so
he
was
bashful
too
for
he
walked
by
her
house
without
pause
he
looked
rather
worried
she
thought
as
well
he
might
and
passing
on
he
disappeared
round
the
church
corner
clearly
on
his
way
to
his
betrothed
he
carried
a
square
parcel
in
his
hand
about
as
big
as
some
that
might
contain
a
tiara
half
an
hour
afterwards
however
he
came
back
still
carrying
the
tiara
it
occurred
to
her
that
the
engagement
might
have
been
broken
off
a
little
later
again
with
a
quickened
pulse
miss
mapp
saw
the
royce
lumber
down
from
the
church
corner
it
stopped
at
her
house
and
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
sables
within
this
time
she
felt
certain
that
susan
had
come
with
her
interesting
news
and
waited
till
withers
having
answered
the
door
came
to
inquire
no
doubt
whether
she
would
see
poppit
but
alas
a
minute
later
the
royce
lumbered
on
carrying
the
additional
weight
of
the
christmas
number
of
which
miss
mapp
had
borrowed
last
night
and
had
not
of
course
had
time
to
glance
at
yet
anticipation
is
supposed
to
be
pleasanter
than
any
fulfilment
however
agreeable
and
if
that
is
the
case
miss
mapp
during
the
next
day
or
two
had
more
enjoyment
than
the
announcement
of
fifty
engagements
could
have
given
her
so
constantly
when
from
the
she
heard
the
sound
of
the
knocker
on
her
front
door
did
she
spring
up
in
certainty
that
this
was
susan
which
it
never
was
but
however
enjoyable
it
all
might
be
she
appeared
to
herself
at
least
to
be
suffering
tortures
of
suspense
through
which
by
degrees
an
idea
painful
and
revolting
in
the
extreme
yet
strangely
exhilarating
began
to
insinuate
itself
into
her
mind
there
seemed
a
deadly
probability
of
the
correctness
of
the
conjecture
as
the
week
went
by
without
further
confirmation
of
that
kiss
for
after
all
who
knew
anything
about
the
character
and
antecedents
of
susan
as
for
wyse
was
he
not
a
constant
visitor
to
the
fierce
and
fickle
south
where
as
everyone
knew
morality
was
wholly
extinct
and
how
if
it
was
all
too
true
should
tilling
treat
this
hitherto
unprecedented
situation
it
was
terrible
to
contemplate
this
moral
upheaval
which
might
prove
to
be
a
social
upheaval
also
time
and
again
as
miss
mapp
vainly
waited
for
news
she
was
within
an
ace
of
communicating
her
suspicions
to
the
padre
he
ought
to
know
for
christmas
as
was
usual
in
december
was
daily
drawing
nearer
there
came
some
through
that
month
a
dark
and
ominous
afternoon
the
rain
falling
sad
and
thick
and
so
unusual
a
density
of
cloud
dwelling
in
the
upper
air
that
by
three
miss
mapp
was
quite
unable
until
the
street
lamp
at
the
corner
was
lit
to
carry
out
the
minor
duty
of
keeping
an
eye
on
the
houses
of
captain
puffin
and
major
benjy
the
royce
had
already
lumbered
by
her
door
since
but
so
dark
was
it
that
peer
as
she
might
it
was
lost
in
the
gloom
before
it
came
to
the
dentist
corner
and
miss
mapp
had
to
face
the
fact
that
she
really
did
not
know
whether
it
had
turned
into
the
street
where
susan
lover
lived
or
had
gone
straight
on
it
was
easier
to
imagine
the
worst
and
she
had
already
pictured
to
herself
a
clandestine
meeting
between
those
passionate
ones
who
under
cover
of
this
darkness
were
imperviously
concealed
from
any
observation
beneath
an
umbrella
from
her
nothing
but
a
powerful
searchlight
could
reveal
what
was
going
on
in
the
window
of
house
and
apart
from
the
fact
that
she
had
not
got
a
powerful
searchlight
it
was
strongly
improbable
that
anything
of
a
very
intimate
nature
was
going
on
there
it
was
not
likely
that
they
would
choose
the
window
she
thought
of
calling
on
wyse
and
asking
for
the
loan
of
a
book
so
that
she
would
see
whether
the
sables
were
in
the
hall
but
even
then
she
would
not
really
be
much
further
on
even
as
she
considered
this
a
began
to
creep
through
the
street
outside
and
in
a
few
minutes
it
was
blotted
from
view
nothing
was
visible
and
nothing
audible
but
the
hissing
of
the
shrouded
rain
suddenly
from
close
outside
came
the
sound
of
a
imperiously
plied
which
could
be
no
other
than
her
own
only
a
telegram
or
some
urgent
errand
could
bring
anyone
out
on
such
a
day
and
unable
to
bear
the
suspense
of
waiting
till
withers
had
answered
it
she
hurried
into
the
house
to
open
the
door
herself
was
the
news
of
the
engagement
coming
to
her
at
last
late
though
it
was
she
would
welcome
it
even
now
for
it
would
atone
in
part
at
any
rate
it
was
diva
diva
dear
said
miss
mapp
enthusiastically
for
withers
was
already
in
the
hall
how
sweet
of
you
to
come
round
anything
special
yes
said
diva
opening
her
eyes
very
wide
and
spreading
a
shower
of
moisture
as
she
whisked
off
her
mackintosh
she
come
this
could
not
refer
to
susan
who
asked
miss
mapp
faradiddleony
said
diva
no
said
miss
mapp
very
loud
so
much
interested
that
she
quite
forgot
to
resent
diva
being
the
first
to
have
the
news
let
have
a
comfortable
cup
of
tea
in
the
tea
withers
miss
mapp
lit
the
candles
there
for
lost
in
meditation
she
had
been
sitting
in
the
dark
and
with
reckless
hospitality
poked
the
fire
to
make
it
blaze
tell
me
all
about
it
she
said
that
would
be
a
treat
for
diva
who
was
such
a
gossip
went
to
the
station
just
now
said
diva
wanted
a
new
besides
the
royce
had
just
gone
down
wyse
and
susan
on
the
platform
sables
asked
miss
mapp
parenthetically
to
complete
the
picture
swaddled
talked
to
them
train
came
in
woman
got
out
kissed
wyse
shook
hands
with
susan
both
hands
while
luggage
was
got
out
much
asked
miss
mapp
quickly
hundreds
covered
with
coronets
and
fs
two
cabs
miss
mapp
mind
on
a
hot
scent
went
back
to
the
previous
telegraphic
utterance
both
hands
did
you
say
dear
she
asked
perhaps
that
the
italian
fashion
maybe
then
what
else
do
you
think
faradiddleony
kissed
susan
wyse
and
she
must
be
engaged
i
ca
account
for
it
any
other
way
he
must
have
written
to
tell
his
sister
could
have
told
her
then
at
the
station
must
have
been
engaged
some
days
and
we
never
knew
they
went
to
look
at
the
orchid
remember
that
was
when
it
was
bitter
no
doubt
but
the
bitterness
could
be
transmuted
into
an
amazing
sweetness
then
now
i
can
speak
said
miss
mapp
with
a
sigh
of
great
relief
oh
it
has
been
so
hard
keeping
silence
but
i
felt
i
ought
to
i
knew
all
along
diva
dear
all
all
along
how
asked
diva
with
a
fallen
crest
miss
mapp
laughed
merrily
i
looked
out
of
the
window
dear
while
you
went
for
your
hanky
and
peeped
into
and
boudoir
did
you
there
they
were
on
the
lawn
and
they
kissed
each
other
so
i
said
to
myself
susan
has
got
him
perseverance
rewarded
h
only
a
guess
of
yours
or
did
susan
tell
you
no
dear
she
said
nothing
but
susan
was
always
secretive
but
they
might
not
have
been
engaged
at
all
said
diva
with
a
brightened
eye
man
does
always
marry
a
woman
he
kisses
diva
had
betrayed
the
lowness
of
her
mind
now
by
hazarding
that
which
had
for
days
dwelt
in
miss
mapp
mind
as
almost
certain
she
drew
in
her
breath
with
a
hissing
noise
as
if
in
pain
darling
what
a
dreadful
suggestion
she
said
no
such
idea
ever
occurred
to
me
secretive
i
thought
susan
might
be
but
immoral
never
i
must
forget
you
ever
thought
that
let
talk
about
something
less
painful
perhaps
you
would
like
to
tell
me
more
about
the
contessa
diva
had
the
grace
to
look
ashamed
of
herself
and
to
take
refuge
in
the
new
topic
so
thoughtfully
suggested
could
see
clearly
she
said
so
dark
but
tall
and
lean
sneezed
that
might
happen
to
anybody
dear
said
miss
mapp
whether
tall
or
short
nothing
more
an
eyeglass
said
diva
after
thought
a
single
one
asked
miss
mapp
on
a
string
how
strange
for
a
woman
that
seemed
positively
the
last
atom
of
diva
knowledge
and
though
miss
mapp
tried
on
the
principles
of
to
disinter
something
she
had
forgotten
the
catechism
led
to
no
results
whatever
but
diva
had
evidently
something
else
to
say
for
after
finishing
her
tea
she
whizzed
backwards
and
forwards
from
window
to
fireplace
with
little
grunts
and
whistles
as
was
her
habit
when
she
was
struggling
with
utterance
long
before
it
came
out
miss
mapp
had
of
course
guessed
what
it
was
no
wonder
diva
found
difficulty
in
speaking
of
a
matter
in
which
she
had
behaved
so
deplorably
about
that
wretched
dress
she
said
at
length
got
it
stained
with
chocolate
first
time
i
wore
it
and
neither
i
nor
janet
can
get
it
out
hurrah
thought
miss
mapp
must
have
it
dyed
again
continued
diva
thought
i
better
tell
you
else
you
might
have
yours
dyed
the
same
colour
as
mine
again
to
all
came
out
of
vogue
and
trout
rather
funny
you
know
but
expensive
you
should
have
seen
your
face
elizabeth
when
you
came
in
to
susan
the
other
night
should
i
dearest
said
miss
mapp
trembling
violently
yes
would
have
gone
home
with
you
in
the
dark
for
anything
murder
diva
dear
said
miss
mapp
anxiously
you
got
a
mind
which
likes
to
put
the
worst
construction
on
everything
if
wyse
kisses
his
intended
you
think
things
too
terrible
for
words
if
i
look
surprised
you
think
i
full
of
hatred
and
malice
be
more
generous
dear
put
evil
constructions
on
all
you
see
ho
said
diva
with
a
world
of
meaning
i
do
know
what
you
intend
to
convey
by
ho
said
miss
mapp
and
i
sha
try
to
guess
but
be
kinder
darling
and
it
will
make
you
happier
thinketh
no
evil
you
know
charity
diva
felt
that
the
limit
of
what
was
tolerable
was
reached
when
elizabeth
lectured
her
on
the
need
of
charity
and
she
would
no
doubt
have
explained
tersely
and
unmistakably
exactly
what
she
meant
by
ho
had
not
withers
opportunely
entered
to
clear
away
tea
she
brought
a
note
with
her
which
miss
mapp
opened
encourage
me
to
hope
were
the
first
words
that
met
her
eye
poppit
had
been
encouraging
him
to
hope
again
to
dine
at
wyse
she
said
no
doubt
the
announcement
will
be
made
then
he
probably
wrote
it
before
he
went
to
the
station
yes
a
few
friends
you
going
dear
diva
instantly
got
up
think
i
run
home
and
see
she
said
by
the
by
elizabeth
what
about
the
the
teagown
if
i
go
you
or
i
if
yours
is
all
covered
with
chocolate
i
should
think
you
like
to
wear
it
said
miss
mapp
could
tuck
it
away
said
diva
just
for
once
put
flowers
then
send
it
to
dyer
you
wo
see
it
again
not
i
mean
miss
mapp
summoned
the
whole
of
her
magnanimity
it
had
been
put
to
a
great
strain
already
and
was
tired
out
but
it
was
capable
of
one
more
effort
wear
it
then
she
said
it
be
a
treat
to
you
but
let
me
know
if
you
not
asked
i
daresay
wyse
will
want
to
keep
it
very
small
dear
i
afraid
you
get
very
wet
going
home
chapter
xi
the
and
the
rain
continued
without
intermission
next
morning
but
shopping
with
umbrellas
and
mackintoshes
was
unusually
brisk
for
there
was
naturally
a
universally
felt
desire
to
catch
sight
of
a
contessa
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
the
foggy
conditions
perhaps
added
to
the
excitement
for
it
was
not
possible
to
see
more
than
a
few
yards
and
thus
at
any
moment
anybody
might
almost
run
into
her
impressions
meagre
though
they
were
had
been
thoroughly
circulated
but
the
morning
passed
and
the
ladies
of
tilling
went
home
to
change
their
wet
things
and
take
a
little
ammoniated
quinine
as
a
precaution
after
so
long
and
chilly
an
exposure
without
a
single
one
of
them
having
caught
sight
of
the
single
eyeglass
it
was
disappointing
but
the
disappointment
was
bearable
since
wyse
so
far
from
wanting
his
party
to
be
very
small
had
been
encouraged
by
poppit
to
hope
that
it
would
include
all
his
world
of
tilling
with
one
exception
he
had
hopes
with
regard
to
the
major
and
the
captain
and
the
padre
and
wee
wifie
and
irene
and
miss
mapp
and
of
course
isabel
but
apparently
he
despaired
of
diva
she
alone
therefore
was
absent
from
this
long
wet
shopping
for
she
waited
indoors
almost
pen
in
hand
to
answer
in
the
affirmative
the
invitation
which
had
at
present
not
arrived
owing
to
the
thickness
of
the
fog
her
absence
from
the
street
passed
unnoticed
for
everybody
supposed
that
everybody
else
had
seen
her
while
she
biting
her
nails
at
home
waited
and
waited
and
waited
then
she
waited
about
a
quarter
past
one
she
gave
it
up
and
duly
telephoned
according
to
promise
viâ
janet
and
withers
to
miss
mapp
to
say
that
wyse
had
not
yet
hoped
it
was
very
unpleasant
to
let
them
know
but
if
she
had
herself
rung
up
and
been
answered
by
elizabeth
who
usually
rushed
to
the
telephone
she
felt
that
she
would
sooner
have
choked
than
have
delivered
this
message
so
janet
telephoned
and
withers
said
she
would
tell
her
mistress
and
did
miss
mapp
was
steeped
in
pleasant
conjectures
the
most
likely
of
all
was
that
the
contessa
had
seen
that
roundabout
little
busybody
in
the
station
and
taken
an
instant
dislike
to
her
through
her
single
eyeglass
or
she
might
have
seen
poor
diva
inquisitively
inspecting
the
luggage
with
the
coronets
and
the
fs
on
it
and
have
learned
with
pain
that
this
was
one
of
the
ladies
of
tilling
algernon
she
would
have
said
so
said
miss
mapp
to
herself
who
is
that
queer
little
woman
is
she
going
to
steal
some
of
my
luggage
and
then
algernon
would
have
told
her
that
this
was
poor
diva
quite
a
decent
sort
of
little
body
but
when
it
came
to
algernon
asking
his
guests
for
the
in
honour
of
his
betrothal
and
her
arrival
at
tilling
no
doubt
the
contessa
would
have
said
algernon
i
beg
or
if
diva
poor
diva
was
right
in
her
conjectures
that
the
notes
had
been
written
before
the
arrival
of
the
train
it
was
evident
that
algernon
had
torn
up
the
one
addressed
to
diva
when
the
contessa
heard
whom
she
was
to
meet
the
next
evening
or
susan
might
easily
have
insinuated
that
they
would
have
two
very
pleasant
tables
of
bridge
after
dinner
without
including
diva
who
was
so
wrong
and
quarrelsome
over
the
score
any
of
these
explanations
were
quite
satisfactory
and
since
diva
would
not
be
present
miss
mapp
would
naturally
don
the
they
would
all
see
what
looked
like
when
it
decked
a
suitable
wearer
and
was
not
parodied
on
the
other
side
of
a
how
true
as
dear
major
benjy
had
said
that
one
woman
could
wear
what
another
could
not
and
if
there
was
a
woman
who
could
not
wear
it
was
diva
or
was
wyse
really
ashamed
to
let
his
sister
see
diva
in
the
it
would
be
just
like
him
to
be
considerate
of
diva
and
not
permit
her
to
make
a
guy
of
herself
before
the
italian
aristocracy
no
doubt
he
would
ask
her
to
lunch
some
day
quite
quietly
or
had
miss
mapp
bloomed
with
pretty
conjectures
like
some
alpine
meadow
when
smitten
into
flower
by
the
spring
and
enjoyed
her
lunch
very
much
indeed
the
anxiety
and
suspense
of
the
morning
which
instead
of
being
relieved
had
ended
in
utter
gloom
gave
diva
a
headache
and
she
adopted
her
usual
strenuous
methods
of
getting
rid
of
it
so
instead
of
lying
down
and
taking
aspirin
and
dozing
she
set
out
after
lunch
to
walk
it
off
she
sprinted
and
splashed
along
the
miry
roads
indifferent
as
to
whether
she
stepped
in
puddles
or
not
and
careless
how
wet
she
got
she
bit
on
the
bullet
of
her
omission
from
the
this
evening
determining
not
to
mind
one
atom
about
it
but
to
look
forward
to
a
pleasant
evening
at
home
instead
of
going
out
like
this
in
the
wet
and
never
never
under
any
circumstances
would
she
ask
any
of
the
guests
what
sort
of
an
evening
had
been
spent
how
wyse
announced
the
news
and
how
the
faradiddleony
played
bridge
she
said
that
satirical
word
aloud
mouthing
it
to
the
puddles
and
the
dripping
she
would
not
evince
the
slightest
interest
in
it
all
she
would
cover
it
with
spadefuls
of
oblivion
and
when
next
she
met
wyse
she
would
whatever
she
might
feel
behave
exactly
as
usual
she
plumed
herself
on
this
dignified
resolution
and
walked
so
fast
that
the
became
quite
transparent
that
was
the
proper
thing
to
do
she
had
been
grossly
slighted
and
like
a
true
lady
would
be
unaware
of
that
slight
whereas
poor
elizabeth
under
such
circumstances
would
have
devised
a
hundred
petty
schemes
for
rendering
wyse
life
a
burden
to
him
but
if
if
she
only
said
if
she
found
any
reason
to
believe
that
susan
was
at
the
bottom
of
this
then
probably
she
would
think
of
something
worthy
not
so
much
of
a
true
lady
but
of
a
true
woman
without
asking
any
questions
she
might
easily
arrive
at
information
which
would
enable
her
to
identify
susan
as
the
culprit
and
she
would
then
act
in
some
way
which
would
astonish
susan
what
that
way
was
she
need
not
think
yet
and
so
she
devoted
her
entire
mind
to
the
question
all
the
way
home
feeling
better
and
with
her
headache
quite
gone
she
arrived
in
tilling
again
drenched
to
the
skin
it
was
already
after
and
she
abandoned
tea
altogether
and
prepared
to
console
herself
for
her
exclusion
from
gaiety
with
a
good
in
the
shape
of
regular
dinner
instead
of
the
usual
muffin
now
and
a
tray
later
to
add
dignity
to
her
feast
she
put
on
the
for
the
last
time
that
it
would
be
though
the
same
still
since
it
would
be
sent
to
the
dyer
to
go
into
perpetual
mourning
for
its
vanished
glories
she
had
meant
to
send
it
but
all
this
misery
and
anxiety
had
put
it
out
of
her
head
having
dressed
thus
to
the
great
astonishment
of
janet
she
sat
down
to
divert
her
mind
from
trouble
by
patience
as
if
to
reward
her
for
her
stubborn
fortitude
the
malignity
of
the
cards
relented
and
she
brought
out
an
intricate
matter
three
times
running
the
clock
on
her
mantelpiece
chiming
a
quarter
to
eight
surprised
her
with
the
lateness
of
the
hour
and
recalled
to
her
with
a
stab
of
pain
that
it
was
at
wyse
and
at
this
moment
some
seven
pairs
of
eager
feet
were
approaching
the
door
well
she
was
dining
at
a
quarter
to
eight
too
janet
would
enter
presently
to
tell
her
that
her
own
banquet
was
ready
and
gathering
up
her
cards
she
spent
a
pleasant
though
regretful
minute
in
looking
at
herself
and
the
for
the
last
time
in
her
long
glass
the
tremendous
walk
in
the
rain
had
given
her
an
almost
equally
high
colour
janet
foot
was
heard
on
the
stairs
and
she
turned
away
from
the
glass
janet
entered
dinner
said
diva
no
the
telephone
said
janet
wyse
is
on
the
telephone
and
wants
to
speak
to
you
very
particularly
wyse
himself
asked
diva
hardly
believing
her
ears
for
she
knew
wyse
opinion
of
the
telephone
yes
diva
walked
slowly
but
reflected
rapidly
what
must
have
happened
was
that
somebody
had
been
taken
ill
at
the
last
moment
was
it
elizabeth
and
that
he
now
wanted
her
to
fill
the
gap
she
was
torn
in
two
passionately
as
she
longed
to
dine
at
wyse
she
did
not
see
how
such
a
course
was
compatible
with
dignity
he
had
only
asked
her
to
suit
his
own
convenience
it
was
not
out
of
encouragement
to
hope
that
he
invited
her
now
no
wyse
should
want
she
would
say
that
she
had
friends
dining
with
her
that
was
what
the
true
lady
would
do
she
took
up
the
and
said
hullo
it
was
certainly
wyse
voice
that
spoke
to
her
and
it
seemed
to
tremble
with
anxiety
dear
lady
he
began
a
most
terrible
thing
has
happened
wonder
if
elizabeth
very
ill
thought
diva
quite
terrible
said
wyse
can
you
hear
yes
said
diva
hardening
her
heart
by
the
most
calamitous
mistake
the
note
which
i
wrote
you
yesterday
was
never
delivered
figgis
has
just
found
it
in
the
pocket
of
his
overcoat
i
shall
certainly
dismiss
him
unless
you
plead
for
him
can
you
hear
yes
said
diva
excitedly
in
it
i
told
you
that
i
had
been
encouraged
to
hope
that
you
would
dine
with
me
there
was
such
a
gratifying
response
to
my
other
invitations
that
i
most
culpably
and
carelessly
dear
lady
thought
that
everybody
had
accepted
can
you
hear
of
course
i
can
shouted
diva
well
i
come
on
my
knees
to
you
can
you
possibly
forgive
the
joint
stupidity
of
figgis
and
me
and
honour
me
after
all
we
will
put
dinner
off
of
course
at
what
time
in
case
you
are
ever
so
kind
and
indulgent
as
to
come
shall
we
have
it
do
not
break
my
heart
by
refusing
su
poppit
will
send
her
car
for
you
i
have
already
dressed
for
dinner
said
diva
proudly
very
pleased
to
come
at
once
you
are
too
kind
you
are
angelic
said
wyse
the
car
shall
start
at
once
it
is
at
my
door
now
right
said
diva
too
good
too
kind
murmured
wyse
figgis
what
do
i
do
next
diva
clapped
the
instrument
into
place
powder
she
said
to
herself
remembering
what
she
had
seen
in
the
glass
and
whizzed
upstairs
her
fish
would
have
to
be
degraded
into
kedgeree
though
plaice
would
have
done
just
as
well
as
sole
for
that
the
cutlets
could
be
heated
up
again
and
perhaps
the
whisking
for
the
had
not
begun
yet
and
could
still
be
stopped
janet
she
shouted
going
out
to
dinner
stop
the
meringue
she
dashed
an
interesting
pallor
on
to
her
face
as
she
heard
the
hooting
of
the
royce
and
coming
downstairs
stepped
into
its
warm
luxuriousness
for
the
electric
lamp
was
burning
there
were
sables
there
it
was
thoughtful
of
susan
to
put
them
in
but
ostentatious
and
there
was
a
carriage
rug
which
she
was
convinced
was
new
and
was
very
likely
a
present
from
wyse
and
soon
there
was
the
light
streaming
out
from
wyse
open
door
and
wyse
himself
in
the
hall
to
meet
and
greet
and
thank
and
bless
her
she
pleaded
for
the
contrite
figgis
and
was
conducted
in
a
blaze
of
triumph
into
the
where
all
tilling
was
awaiting
her
she
was
led
up
to
the
contessa
with
whom
miss
mapp
wreathed
in
sycophantic
smiles
was
eagerly
conversing
the
there
were
embarrassing
moments
during
dinner
the
contessa
confused
by
having
so
many
people
introduced
to
her
in
a
lump
got
all
their
names
wrong
and
addressed
her
neighbours
as
captain
flint
and
major
puffin
and
thought
that
diva
was
mapp
she
seemed
vivacious
and
dropped
her
into
her
soup
talked
with
her
mouth
full
and
drank
a
good
deal
of
wine
which
was
a
very
bad
example
for
major
puffin
then
there
were
many
sudden
and
complete
pauses
in
the
talk
for
diva
news
of
the
kissing
of
poppit
by
the
contessa
had
spread
like
wildfire
through
the
fog
this
morning
owing
to
miss
dissemination
of
it
and
now
whenever
wyse
raised
his
voice
ever
so
little
everybody
else
stopped
talking
in
the
expectation
that
the
news
was
about
to
be
announced
occasionally
also
the
contessa
addressed
some
remark
to
her
brother
in
shrill
and
voluble
italian
which
rather
confirmed
the
gloomy
estimate
of
her
in
the
matter
of
talking
with
her
mouth
full
for
to
speak
in
italian
was
equivalent
to
whispering
since
the
purport
of
what
she
said
could
not
be
understood
by
anybody
except
him
then
also
the
sensation
of
dining
with
a
countess
produced
a
slight
feeling
of
strain
which
in
addition
to
the
correct
behaviour
which
wyse
presence
always
induced
almost
congealed
correctness
into
stiffness
but
as
dinner
went
on
her
evident
enjoyment
of
herself
made
itself
felt
and
her
eccentricities
though
carefully
observed
and
noted
by
miss
mapp
were
not
succeeded
by
silences
and
hurried
bursts
of
conversation
and
is
your
ladyship
making
a
long
stay
in
tilling
asked
the
real
major
to
cover
the
pause
which
had
been
caused
by
wyse
saying
something
across
the
table
to
isabel
she
dropped
her
with
quite
a
splash
into
her
gravy
pulled
it
out
again
by
the
string
as
if
landing
a
fish
and
sucked
it
that
depends
on
you
gentlemen
she
said
with
greater
audacity
than
was
usual
in
tilling
if
you
and
major
puffin
and
that
sweet
little
scotch
clergyman
all
fall
in
love
with
me
and
fight
duels
about
me
i
will
stop
for
ever
the
major
recovered
himself
before
anybody
else
your
ladyship
may
take
that
for
granted
he
said
gallantly
and
a
perfect
hubbub
of
conversation
rose
to
cover
this
awful
topic
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
you
must
not
call
me
ladyship
captain
flint
she
said
only
servants
say
that
contessa
if
you
like
and
you
must
blow
away
this
fog
for
me
i
have
seen
nothing
but
bales
of
out
of
the
window
tell
me
this
too
why
are
those
ladies
dressed
alike
are
they
sisters
mapp
the
little
round
one
and
her
sister
the
big
round
one
the
major
cast
an
apprehensive
eye
on
miss
mapp
seated
just
opposite
whose
acuteness
of
hearing
was
one
of
the
terrors
of
tilling
his
apprehensions
were
perfectly
well
founded
and
miss
mapp
hated
and
despised
the
contessa
from
that
hour
no
not
sisters
said
he
and
your
la
you
made
a
little
error
about
the
names
the
one
opposite
is
miss
mapp
the
other
mrs
plaistow
the
contessa
moderated
her
voice
i
see
she
looks
vexed
your
miss
mapp
i
think
she
must
have
heard
and
i
will
be
very
nice
to
her
afterwards
why
does
not
one
of
you
gentlemen
marry
her
i
see
i
shall
have
to
arrange
that
the
sweet
little
scotch
clergyman
now
little
men
like
big
wives
ah
married
already
is
he
to
the
mouse
then
it
must
be
you
captain
flint
we
must
have
more
marriages
in
tilling
miss
mapp
could
not
help
glancing
at
the
contessa
as
she
made
this
remarkable
observation
it
must
be
the
cue
she
thought
for
the
announcement
of
that
which
she
had
known
so
long
in
the
space
of
a
wink
the
clever
contessa
saw
that
she
had
her
attention
and
spoke
rather
loudly
to
the
major
i
have
lost
my
heart
to
your
miss
mapp
she
said
i
am
jealous
of
you
captain
flint
she
will
be
my
great
friend
in
tilling
and
if
you
marry
her
i
shall
hate
you
for
that
will
mean
that
she
likes
you
best
miss
mapp
hated
nobody
at
that
moment
not
even
diva
off
whose
face
the
powder
was
crumbling
leaving
little
red
marks
peeping
out
like
the
stars
on
a
fine
evening
dinner
came
to
an
end
with
roasted
chestnuts
brought
by
the
contessa
from
capri
i
always
scold
amelia
for
the
luggage
she
takes
with
her
said
wyse
to
diva
amelia
dear
you
are
my
hostess
everybody
saw
him
look
at
poppit
you
must
catch
somebody
eye
i
will
catch
miss
mapp
said
amelia
and
all
the
ladies
rose
as
if
connected
with
some
hidden
mechanism
which
moved
them
simultaneously
there
was
a
great
deal
of
pretty
diffidence
at
the
door
but
the
contessa
put
an
end
to
that
eldest
first
she
said
and
marched
out
making
miss
mapp
diva
and
the
mouse
feel
remarkably
young
she
might
drop
her
and
talk
with
her
mouth
full
but
really
such
tact
they
all
determined
to
adopt
this
pleasing
device
in
the
future
the
disappointment
about
the
announcement
of
the
engagement
was
sensibly
assuaged
and
miss
mapp
and
susan
in
their
eagerness
to
be
younger
than
the
contessa
and
yet
take
precedence
of
all
the
rest
almost
stuck
in
the
doorway
they
rebounded
from
each
other
and
diva
whizzed
out
between
them
quaint
irene
went
in
her
right
place
last
however
quaint
irene
was
there
was
no
use
in
pretending
that
she
was
not
the
youngest
however
hopelessly
amelia
had
lost
her
heart
to
miss
mapp
she
did
not
devote
her
undivided
attention
to
her
in
the
but
swiftly
established
herself
at
the
where
she
proceeded
with
a
most
complicated
sort
of
patience
and
a
series
of
cigarettes
to
while
away
the
time
till
the
gentlemen
joined
them
though
the
ladies
of
tilling
had
plenty
to
say
to
each
other
it
was
all
about
her
and
such
comments
could
not
conveniently
be
made
in
her
presence
unless
like
her
they
talked
some
language
unknown
to
the
subject
of
their
conversation
they
could
not
talk
at
all
and
so
they
gathered
round
her
table
and
watched
the
lightning
rapidity
with
which
she
piled
black
knaves
on
red
queens
in
some
packs
and
red
knaves
on
black
queens
in
others
she
had
taken
off
all
her
rings
in
order
to
procure
a
greater
freedom
of
finger
and
her
continued
to
crash
on
to
a
glittering
mass
of
magnificent
gems
the
rapidity
of
her
motions
was
only
equalled
by
the
swift
and
surprising
monologue
that
poured
from
her
mouth
there
that
odious
king
gets
in
my
way
she
said
so
like
a
man
to
poke
himself
in
where
he
is
wanted
no
not
that
i
have
a
cigarette
i
hear
all
you
ladies
are
terrific
we
will
have
a
game
presently
and
i
shall
sink
into
the
earth
with
terror
at
your
camorra
there
another
king
and
that
his
own
queen
whom
he
does
want
at
all
he
is
for
that
black
queen
who
is
quite
covered
up
and
he
would
like
to
be
covered
up
with
her
susan
my
dear
that
was
interesting
but
they
all
knew
it
already
kindly
ring
the
bell
for
coffee
i
expire
if
i
do
not
get
my
coffee
at
once
and
a
toothpick
tell
me
all
the
scandal
of
tilling
miss
mapp
while
i
play
all
the
dreadful
histories
of
that
major
and
that
captain
such
a
grand
air
has
the
captain
no
it
is
the
major
the
one
who
does
not
limp
which
of
all
you
ladies
do
they
love
most
it
is
miss
mapp
i
believe
that
is
why
she
does
not
answer
me
ah
here
is
the
coffee
and
the
other
king
three
lumps
of
sugar
dear
susan
and
then
stir
it
up
well
and
hold
it
to
my
mouth
so
that
i
can
drink
without
interruption
ah
the
ace
he
is
the
intervener
or
is
it
the
king
proctor
it
would
be
nice
to
have
a
proctor
who
told
you
all
the
that
were
going
on
susan
you
must
get
me
a
proctor
you
shall
be
my
proctor
and
here
are
the
men
the
wretches
they
have
been
preferring
wine
to
women
and
we
will
have
our
bridge
and
if
anybody
scolds
me
i
shall
cry
miss
mapp
and
captain
flint
will
hold
my
hand
and
comfort
me
she
gathered
up
a
heap
of
cards
and
rings
dropped
them
on
the
floor
and
cut
with
the
remainder
miss
mapp
was
very
lenient
with
the
contessa
who
was
her
partner
and
pointed
out
the
mistakes
of
her
and
their
adversaries
with
the
most
winning
smile
and
eagerness
to
explain
things
clearly
then
she
revoked
heavily
herself
and
the
contessa
so
far
from
being
angry
with
her
burst
into
peals
of
unquenchable
merriment
this
way
of
taking
a
revoke
was
new
to
tilling
for
the
right
thing
was
for
the
revoker
partner
to
sulk
and
be
sarcastic
for
at
least
twenty
minutes
after
the
laughter
continued
to
spurt
out
at
intervals
during
the
rest
of
the
rubber
and
it
was
all
very
pleasant
but
at
the
end
she
said
she
was
not
up
to
tilling
standards
at
all
and
refused
to
play
any
more
miss
mapp
in
the
highest
urged
her
not
to
despair
indeed
dear
contessa
she
said
you
play
very
well
a
little
overbidding
of
your
hand
perhaps
do
you
think
but
that
is
a
tendency
we
are
all
subject
to
i
often
overbid
my
hand
myself
not
a
little
wee
rubber
more
i
sure
i
should
like
to
be
your
partner
again
you
must
come
and
play
at
my
house
some
afternoon
we
will
have
tea
early
and
get
a
good
two
hours
nothing
like
practice
the
evening
came
to
an
end
without
the
great
announcement
being
made
but
miss
mapp
as
she
reviewed
the
events
of
the
party
sitting
next
morning
in
her
found
the
whole
evidence
so
overwhelming
that
it
was
no
longer
worth
while
to
form
conjectures
however
fruitful
on
the
subject
and
she
diverted
her
mind
to
pleasing
reminiscences
and
projects
for
the
future
she
had
certainly
been
distinguished
by
the
contessa
marked
regard
and
her
opinion
of
her
charm
and
ability
was
of
the
very
highest
no
doubt
her
strange
remark
about
duelling
at
dinner
had
been
humorous
in
intention
but
many
a
true
word
is
spoken
in
jest
and
the
contessa
perspicacious
woman
had
seen
at
once
that
major
benjy
and
captain
puffin
were
just
the
sort
of
men
who
might
get
to
duelling
or
at
any
rate
challenging
about
a
woman
and
her
asking
which
of
the
ladies
the
men
were
most
in
love
with
and
her
saying
that
she
believed
it
was
miss
mapp
miss
mapp
had
turned
nearly
as
red
as
poor
diva
when
that
came
out
so
lightly
and
yet
so
acutely
diva
it
had
of
course
been
a
horrid
blow
to
find
that
diva
had
been
asked
to
wyse
party
in
the
first
instance
and
an
even
shrewder
one
when
diva
entered
with
such
unnecessary
fussing
and
apology
on
the
part
of
wyse
in
the
luckily
it
would
be
seen
no
more
for
diva
had
promised
if
you
could
trust
diva
to
send
it
to
the
dyer
but
it
was
a
great
puzzle
to
know
why
diva
had
it
on
at
all
if
she
was
preparing
to
spend
a
solitary
evening
at
home
by
eight
she
ought
by
rights
to
have
already
had
her
tray
dressed
in
some
old
thing
but
within
three
minutes
of
her
being
telephoned
for
she
had
appeared
in
the
and
eaten
so
heartily
that
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
greedy
though
she
was
that
she
had
already
consumed
her
tray
but
in
spite
of
diva
adventitious
triumph
the
main
feeling
in
miss
mapp
mind
was
pity
for
her
she
looked
so
ridiculous
in
that
dress
with
the
powder
peeling
off
her
red
face
no
wonder
the
dear
contessa
stared
when
she
came
in
there
was
her
for
the
contessa
to
consider
the
contessa
would
be
less
nervous
perhaps
if
there
was
only
one
table
that
would
be
more
homey
and
cosy
and
it
would
at
the
same
time
give
rise
to
great
and
indignation
in
the
breasts
of
those
who
were
left
out
diva
would
certainly
be
one
of
the
spurned
and
the
contessa
would
not
play
with
wyse
then
there
was
major
benjy
he
must
certainly
be
asked
for
it
was
evident
that
the
contessa
delighted
in
him
suddenly
miss
mapp
began
to
feel
less
sure
that
major
benjy
must
be
of
the
party
the
contessa
charming
though
she
was
had
said
several
very
tropical
italian
things
to
him
she
had
told
him
that
she
would
stop
here
for
ever
if
the
men
fought
duels
about
her
she
had
said
you
dear
darling
to
him
at
bridge
when
as
adversary
he
failed
to
trump
her
losing
card
and
she
had
asked
him
to
ask
her
to
tea
with
no
one
else
for
i
have
a
great
deal
to
say
to
you
when
the
general
macédoine
of
sables
au
reservoirs
and
thanks
for
such
a
nice
evening
took
place
in
the
hall
miss
mapp
was
not
in
fact
sure
when
she
thought
it
over
that
the
contessa
was
a
nice
friend
for
major
benjy
she
did
not
do
him
the
injustice
of
imagining
that
he
would
ask
her
to
tea
alone
the
very
suggestion
proved
that
it
must
be
a
piece
of
the
contessa
southern
extravagance
of
expression
but
after
all
thought
miss
mapp
to
herself
as
she
writhed
at
the
idea
her
other
extravagant
expressions
were
proved
to
cover
a
good
deal
of
truth
in
fact
the
major
chance
of
being
asked
to
the
select
diminished
swiftly
towards
vanishing
point
it
was
time
and
indeed
late
to
set
forth
on
morning
marketings
and
miss
mapp
had
already
determined
not
to
carry
her
capacious
basket
with
her
in
case
of
meeting
the
contessa
in
the
high
street
it
would
be
grander
and
wysier
and
more
magnificent
to
go
and
direct
that
the
goods
should
be
sent
up
rather
than
run
the
risk
of
encountering
the
contessa
with
a
basket
containing
a
couple
of
mutton
cutlets
a
ball
of
wool
and
some
so
she
put
on
her
prince
of
wales
cloak
and
postponing
further
reflection
over
the
till
a
less
busy
occasion
set
forth
in
unencumbered
gentility
for
the
morning
gossip
at
the
corner
of
the
high
street
she
ran
into
diva
news
said
diva
met
wyse
just
now
engaged
to
susan
all
over
the
town
by
now
everybody
knows
oh
there
the
padre
for
the
first
time
she
shot
across
the
street
and
miss
mapp
shaking
the
dust
of
diva
off
her
feet
proceeded
on
her
chagrined
way
annoyed
as
she
was
with
diva
she
was
almost
more
annoyed
with
susan
after
all
she
had
done
for
susan
susan
ought
to
have
told
her
long
ago
pledging
her
to
secrecy
but
to
be
told
like
this
by
that
common
diva
without
any
secrecy
at
all
was
an
affront
that
she
would
find
it
hard
to
forgive
susan
for
she
mentally
reduced
by
a
half
the
sum
that
she
had
determined
to
squander
on
susan
it
should
be
plated
not
silver
and
if
susan
was
not
careful
it
should
be
plated
at
all
she
had
just
come
out
of
the
chemist
after
an
indignant
interview
about
precipitated
chalk
he
had
deposited
the
small
packet
on
the
counter
when
she
asked
to
have
it
sent
up
to
her
house
he
could
not
undertake
to
deliver
small
packages
she
left
the
precipitated
chalk
lying
there
emerging
she
heard
a
loud
foreign
sort
of
scream
from
close
at
hand
there
was
the
contessa
all
by
herself
carrying
a
marketing
basket
of
unusual
size
and
newness
it
contained
a
bloody
steak
and
a
crab
but
where
is
your
basket
miss
mapp
she
exclaimed
algernon
told
me
that
all
the
great
ladies
of
tilling
went
marketing
in
the
morning
with
big
baskets
and
that
if
i
aspired
to
be
i
must
have
my
basket
too
it
is
the
greatest
fun
and
i
have
already
written
to
cecco
to
say
i
am
just
going
marketing
with
my
basket
look
the
steak
is
for
figgis
and
the
crab
is
for
algernon
and
me
if
figgis
does
not
get
it
but
why
are
you
not
are
you
miss
mapp
she
gave
a
croak
of
laughter
and
tickled
the
crab
will
he
eat
the
steak
do
you
think
she
went
on
is
he
not
lively
i
went
to
the
shop
of
hopkins
who
was
not
there
because
he
was
engaged
with
miss
coles
and
was
that
not
miss
coles
last
night
at
my
brother
the
one
who
spat
in
the
fire
when
nobody
but
i
was
looking
you
are
enchanting
at
tilling
what
is
hopkins
doing
with
miss
coles
do
they
kiss
but
your
market
basket
that
disappoints
me
for
algernon
said
you
had
the
biggest
of
all
i
bought
the
biggest
i
could
find
is
it
as
big
as
yours
miss
mapp
head
was
in
a
whirl
the
contessa
said
in
the
loudest
possible
voice
all
that
everybody
else
only
whispered
she
displayed
in
her
basket
all
that
everybody
else
covered
up
with
thick
layers
of
paper
if
miss
mapp
had
only
guessed
that
the
contessa
would
have
a
she
would
have
paraded
the
high
street
with
a
leg
of
mutton
protruding
from
one
end
and
a
pair
of
wellington
boots
from
the
other
but
who
could
have
suspected
that
a
contessa
black
thoughts
succeeded
was
it
possible
that
wyse
had
been
satirical
about
the
affairs
of
tilling
if
so
she
wished
him
nothing
worse
than
to
be
married
to
susan
but
a
playful
face
must
be
put
for
the
moment
on
the
situation
too
lovely
of
you
dear
contessa
she
said
may
we
go
marketing
together
and
we
will
measure
the
size
of
our
baskets
such
fun
i
have
too
laughing
at
the
dear
people
in
tilling
but
what
thrilling
news
this
morning
about
our
sweet
susan
and
your
dear
brother
though
of
course
i
knew
it
long
ago
indeed
how
was
that
said
the
contessa
quite
sharply
miss
mapp
was
nettled
at
her
tone
oh
you
must
allow
me
two
eyes
she
said
since
it
was
merely
tedious
to
explain
how
she
had
seen
them
from
behind
a
curtain
kissing
in
the
garden
just
two
eyes
and
a
nose
for
scent
remarked
the
contessa
very
genially
this
was
certainly
coarse
though
probably
italian
miss
mapp
opinion
of
the
contessa
fluctuated
violently
like
a
barometer
before
a
storm
and
indicated
changeable
dear
susan
is
such
an
intimate
friend
she
said
the
contessa
looked
at
her
very
fixedly
for
a
moment
and
then
appeared
to
dismiss
the
matter
my
crab
my
steak
she
said
and
where
does
your
nice
captain
no
major
flint
live
i
have
a
note
to
leave
on
him
for
he
has
asked
me
to
tea
all
alone
to
see
his
tiger
skins
he
is
going
to
be
my
flirt
while
i
am
in
tilling
and
when
i
go
he
will
break
his
heart
but
i
will
have
told
him
who
can
mend
it
again
dear
major
benjy
said
miss
mapp
at
her
wits
end
to
know
how
to
deal
with
so
a
lady
what
a
treat
it
will
be
to
him
to
have
you
to
tea
is
it
the
contessa
quite
distinctly
winked
behind
her
eyeglass
which
she
had
put
up
to
look
at
diva
who
whirled
by
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
and
if
i
said
she
remarked
you
would
what
is
it
that
that
one
says
and
she
indicated
diva
yes
you
would
pop
in
and
the
good
major
would
pay
no
attention
to
me
so
if
i
tell
you
i
shall
go
you
will
know
that
is
a
lie
you
clever
miss
mapp
and
so
you
will
go
to
tea
with
him
and
find
me
there
now
where
is
his
house
this
was
a
sort
of
scheming
that
had
never
entered
into
miss
life
and
she
saw
with
pain
how
shallow
she
had
been
all
these
years
often
and
often
she
had
when
inquisitive
questions
were
put
her
answered
them
without
any
strict
subservience
to
truth
but
never
had
she
thought
of
confusing
the
issues
like
this
if
she
told
diva
a
lie
diva
probably
guessed
it
was
a
lie
and
acted
accordingly
but
she
had
never
thought
of
making
it
practically
impossible
to
tell
whether
it
was
a
lie
or
not
she
had
no
more
idea
when
she
walked
back
along
the
high
street
with
the
contessa
swinging
her
basket
by
her
side
whether
that
lady
was
going
to
tea
with
major
benjy
or
or
when
than
she
knew
whether
the
crab
was
going
to
eat
the
beefsteak
there
his
house
she
said
as
they
paused
at
the
dentist
corner
and
there
mine
next
it
with
the
little
of
my
looking
out
on
to
the
street
i
hope
to
welcome
you
there
dear
contessa
for
a
tiny
game
of
bridge
and
some
tea
one
of
these
days
very
soon
what
day
do
you
think
then
she
would
know
if
the
contessa
was
going
to
tea
with
major
benjy
unfortunately
the
contessa
appeared
to
know
that
she
would
know
it
too
my
flirt
she
said
perhaps
i
may
be
having
tea
with
my
flirt
better
anything
than
that
i
will
ask
him
too
to
meet
you
said
miss
mapp
feeling
in
some
awful
and
helpless
way
that
she
was
playing
her
adversary
game
adversary
did
she
say
to
herself
she
did
the
inscrutable
contessa
was
up
to
that
too
i
will
not
amalgamate
my
treats
she
said
so
that
is
his
house
what
a
charming
house
how
my
heart
flutters
as
i
ring
the
bell
miss
mapp
was
now
quite
distraught
there
was
the
possibility
that
the
contessa
might
tell
major
benjy
that
it
was
time
he
married
but
on
the
other
hand
she
was
making
arrangements
to
go
to
tea
with
him
on
an
unknown
date
and
the
hero
of
amorous
adventures
in
india
and
elsewhere
might
lose
his
heart
again
to
somebody
quite
different
from
one
whom
he
could
hope
to
marry
by
daylight
the
dear
contessa
was
undeniably
plain
that
was
something
but
in
these
short
days
tea
would
be
conducted
by
artificial
light
and
by
artificial
light
she
was
not
so
like
a
rabbit
what
was
worse
was
that
by
any
light
she
had
a
liveliness
which
might
be
mistaken
for
wit
and
a
flattering
manner
which
might
be
taken
for
sincerity
she
hoped
men
were
not
so
easily
duped
as
that
and
was
sadly
afraid
that
they
were
blind
fools
the
number
of
visits
that
miss
mapp
made
about
in
this
week
before
christmas
to
the
at
the
corner
of
the
high
street
with
an
envelope
in
her
hand
containing
hopkins
bill
for
fish
and
a
postal
order
enclosed
baffles
computation
naturally
she
did
not
intend
either
by
day
or
night
to
risk
being
found
again
with
a
blank
unstamped
envelope
in
her
hand
and
the
one
enclosing
hopkins
bill
and
the
postal
order
would
have
passed
scrutiny
for
correctness
anywhere
but
fair
and
calm
as
was
the
exterior
of
that
envelope
none
could
tell
how
agitated
was
the
hand
that
carried
it
backwards
and
forwards
until
the
edges
got
crumpled
and
the
inscription
clouded
with
much
fingering
indeed
of
all
the
tricks
that
miss
mapp
had
compassed
for
others
none
was
so
sumptuously
contrived
as
that
in
which
she
had
now
entangled
herself
for
these
december
days
were
dark
and
in
consequence
not
only
would
the
contessa
be
looking
her
best
such
as
it
was
at
but
from
miss
mapp
window
it
was
impossible
to
tell
whether
she
had
gone
to
tea
with
him
on
any
particular
afternoon
for
there
had
been
a
strike
at
the
and
the
lamp
at
the
corner
which
in
happier
days
would
have
told
all
told
nothing
whatever
miss
mapp
must
therefore
trudge
to
the
with
hopkins
bill
in
her
hand
as
she
went
out
and
after
a
feint
of
posting
it
with
it
in
her
pocket
as
she
came
back
in
order
to
gather
from
the
light
in
the
windows
from
the
sound
of
conversation
that
would
be
audible
as
she
passed
close
beneath
them
whether
the
major
was
having
tea
there
or
not
and
with
whom
should
she
hear
that
ringing
laugh
which
had
sounded
so
pleasant
when
she
revoked
but
now
was
so
sinister
she
had
quite
determined
to
go
in
and
borrow
a
book
or
a
anything
the
major
could
scarcely
fail
to
ask
her
to
tea
and
once
there
wild
horses
should
not
drag
her
away
until
she
had
outstayed
the
other
visitor
then
as
her
malady
of
jealousy
grew
more
feverish
she
began
to
perceive
as
by
the
ray
of
some
dreadful
dawn
that
lights
in
the
major
room
and
sounds
of
elfin
laughter
were
not
completely
trustworthy
as
proofs
that
the
contessa
was
there
it
was
possible
awfully
possible
that
the
two
might
be
sitting
in
the
firelight
that
voices
might
be
hushed
to
amorous
whisperings
that
pregnant
smiles
might
be
taking
the
place
of
laughter
on
one
such
afternoon
as
she
came
back
from
the
with
patient
hopkins
overdue
bill
in
her
pocket
a
wild
certainty
seized
her
when
she
saw
how
closely
the
curtains
were
drawn
and
how
still
it
seemed
inside
his
room
that
firelight
dalliance
was
going
on
she
rang
the
bell
and
imagined
she
heard
whisperings
inside
while
it
was
being
answered
presently
the
light
went
up
in
the
hall
and
the
major
dominic
opened
the
door
the
major
is
in
i
think
is
he
mrs
dominic
said
miss
mapp
in
her
most
insinuating
tones
no
miss
out
said
dominic
uncompromisingly
miss
mapp
wondered
if
dominic
drank
dear
me
how
tiresome
when
he
told
me
said
she
with
playful
annoyance
would
you
be
very
kind
dominic
and
just
see
for
certain
that
he
is
not
in
his
room
he
may
have
come
in
no
miss
he
out
said
dominic
with
the
utterance
of
the
determined
liar
any
message
miss
mapp
turned
away
more
certain
than
ever
that
he
was
in
and
immersed
in
dalliance
she
would
have
continued
to
be
quite
certain
about
it
had
she
not
glancing
distractedly
down
the
street
caught
sight
of
him
coming
up
with
captain
puffin
meantime
she
had
twice
attempted
to
get
up
a
cosy
little
party
of
four
so
as
not
to
frighten
the
contessa
to
play
bridge
from
tea
till
dinner
and
on
both
occasions
the
faradiddleony
for
so
she
had
become
was
most
unfortunately
engaged
but
the
second
of
these
disappointing
replies
contained
the
hope
that
they
would
meet
at
their
marketings
morning
and
though
poor
miss
mapp
was
really
getting
very
tired
with
these
innumerable
visits
to
the
whether
wet
or
fine
she
set
forth
next
morning
with
the
hopes
anyhow
of
finding
out
whether
the
contessa
had
been
to
tea
with
major
flint
or
on
what
day
she
was
going
there
she
was
just
opposite
the
post
office
and
there
oh
shame
was
major
benjy
on
his
way
to
the
tram
in
conversation
with
her
it
was
a
slight
consolation
that
captain
puffin
was
there
too
miss
mapp
quickened
her
steps
to
a
little
tripping
run
dear
contessa
so
sorry
i
am
late
she
said
such
a
lot
of
little
things
to
do
this
morning
major
benjy
captain
puffin
oh
how
naughty
of
you
to
have
begun
your
shopping
without
me
only
been
to
the
grocer
said
the
contessa
major
benjy
has
been
so
amusing
that
i
have
got
on
with
my
shopping
at
all
i
have
written
to
cecco
to
say
that
there
is
no
one
so
witty
major
benjy
thought
miss
mapp
bitterly
remembering
how
long
it
had
taken
her
to
arrive
at
that
and
witty
she
had
not
arrived
at
that
yet
no
indeed
said
the
major
it
was
the
contessa
miss
mapp
who
has
been
so
entertaining
i
sure
she
would
be
said
miss
mapp
with
an
enormous
smile
and
oh
major
benjy
you
miss
your
tram
unless
you
hurry
and
get
no
golf
at
all
and
then
be
vexed
with
us
for
keeping
you
you
men
always
blame
us
poor
women
well
upon
my
word
what
a
game
of
golf
compared
with
the
pleasure
of
being
with
the
ladies
asked
the
major
with
a
great
fat
bow
i
want
to
catch
that
tram
said
puffin
quite
distinctly
and
miss
mapp
found
herself
more
nearly
forgetting
his
inebriated
insults
than
ever
before
you
poor
captain
puffin
said
the
contessa
you
shall
catch
it
be
off
both
of
you
at
once
i
will
not
say
another
word
to
either
of
you
i
will
never
forgive
you
if
you
miss
it
but
afternoon
major
benjy
he
turned
round
to
bow
again
and
a
bicycle
luckily
for
the
rider
going
very
slowly
butted
softly
into
him
behind
not
hurt
called
the
contessa
good
ah
miss
mapp
let
us
get
to
our
shopping
how
well
you
manage
those
men
how
right
you
are
about
them
they
want
their
golf
more
than
they
want
us
whatever
they
may
say
they
would
hate
us
if
we
kept
them
from
their
golf
so
sorry
not
to
have
been
able
to
play
bridge
with
you
yesterday
but
an
engagement
what
a
busy
place
tilling
is
let
me
see
where
is
the
list
of
things
that
figgis
told
me
to
buy
that
figgis
a
for
his
pantry
and
some
blacking
for
his
boots
and
some
flannel
i
suppose
for
his
fat
stomach
it
is
all
for
figgis
and
there
is
that
swift
plaistow
she
comes
like
a
train
with
a
red
light
in
her
face
and
wheels
and
whistlings
she
talks
like
a
telegram
mrs
plaistow
enjoyed
my
game
of
bridge
contessa
panted
diva
delightful
game
of
bridge
yesterday
the
contessa
seemed
in
rather
a
hurry
to
reply
but
long
before
she
could
get
a
word
out
miss
mapp
felt
she
knew
what
had
happened
so
pleased
said
the
contessa
quickly
and
now
for
figgis
towels
miss
mapp
ten
and
sixpence
apiece
he
says
what
a
price
to
give
for
a
towel
but
i
learn
housekeeping
like
this
and
cecco
will
delight
in
all
the
economies
i
shall
make
quick
to
the
draper
lest
there
should
be
no
towels
left
in
spite
of
figgis
list
the
contessa
shopping
was
soon
over
and
miss
mapp
having
seen
her
as
far
as
the
corner
walked
on
as
if
to
her
own
house
in
order
to
give
her
time
to
get
to
wyse
and
then
fled
back
to
the
high
street
the
suspense
was
unbearable
she
had
to
know
without
delay
when
and
where
diva
and
the
contessa
had
played
bridge
yesterday
never
had
her
eye
so
rapidly
scanned
the
movement
of
passengers
in
that
entrancing
thoroughfare
in
order
to
pick
diva
out
and
learn
from
her
precisely
what
had
happened
there
she
was
coming
out
of
the
dyer
with
her
basket
completely
filled
by
a
bulky
package
which
it
needed
no
ingenuity
to
identify
as
the
late
she
would
have
to
be
pleasant
with
diva
for
much
as
that
perfidious
woman
might
enjoy
telling
her
where
this
furtive
had
taken
place
she
might
enjoy
even
more
torturing
her
with
uncertainty
diva
could
if
put
to
it
give
no
answer
whatever
to
a
direct
question
but
skilfully
changing
the
subject
talk
about
something
utterly
different
the
said
miss
mapp
pointing
to
the
basket
hope
it
will
turn
out
well
dear
there
was
rather
a
wicked
light
in
diva
eyes
not
she
said
sweet
of
you
to
have
it
dyed
again
dear
diva
said
miss
mapp
not
very
expensive
i
trust
send
the
bill
in
to
you
if
you
like
said
diva
miss
mapp
laughed
very
pleasantly
that
would
be
a
good
joke
she
said
how
nice
it
is
that
the
dear
contessa
takes
so
warmly
to
our
tilling
ways
so
amusing
she
was
about
the
commissions
figgis
had
given
her
but
a
wee
bit
satirical
do
you
think
this
ought
to
put
diva
in
a
good
temper
for
there
was
nothing
she
liked
so
much
as
a
few
little
dabs
at
somebody
else
diva
was
not
very
she
is
rather
satirical
said
diva
oh
tell
me
some
of
her
amusing
little
speeches
said
miss
mapp
enthusiastically
i
ca
always
follow
her
but
you
are
so
quick
a
little
coarse
too
at
times
is
she
what
she
said
the
other
night
when
she
was
playing
patience
about
the
queens
and
kings
quite
was
it
and
the
toothpick
yes
toothpick
said
diva
perhaps
she
has
bad
teeth
said
miss
mapp
it
runs
in
families
and
wyse
you
know
we
lucky
you
and
i
diva
maintained
a
complete
silence
and
they
had
now
come
nearly
as
far
as
her
door
if
she
would
not
give
the
information
that
she
knew
miss
mapp
longed
for
she
must
be
asked
for
it
with
the
uncertain
hope
that
she
would
give
it
then
been
playing
bridge
lately
dear
asked
miss
mapp
quite
lately
said
diva
i
thought
i
heard
you
say
something
about
it
to
the
contessa
yesterday
was
it
whom
did
you
play
with
diva
paused
and
when
they
had
come
quite
to
her
door
made
up
her
mind
contessa
susan
wyse
me
she
said
but
i
thought
she
never
played
with
wyse
said
miss
mapp
had
to
get
a
four
said
diva
contessa
wanted
her
bridge
nobody
else
she
popped
into
her
house
there
is
no
use
in
describing
miss
mapp
state
of
mind
except
by
saying
that
for
the
moment
she
quite
forgot
that
the
contessa
was
almost
certainly
going
to
tea
with
major
benjy
chapter
xii
peace
on
earth
and
mercy
mild
sang
miss
mapp
holding
her
head
back
with
her
uvula
clearly
visible
she
sat
in
her
usual
seat
close
below
the
pulpit
and
the
sun
streaming
in
through
a
stained
glass
window
opposite
made
her
face
of
all
colours
like
joseph
coat
not
knowing
how
it
looked
from
outside
she
pictured
to
herself
a
sort
of
celestial
radiance
coming
from
within
though
diva
sitting
opposite
was
reminded
of
the
iridescent
hues
observable
on
cold
boiled
beef
but
then
miss
mapp
had
registered
the
fact
that
diva
notion
of
singing
alto
was
to
follow
the
trebles
at
the
uniform
distance
of
a
minor
third
below
so
that
matters
were
about
square
between
them
she
wondered
between
the
verses
if
she
could
say
something
very
tactful
to
diva
which
might
before
next
christmas
induce
her
not
to
make
that
noise
major
flint
came
in
just
before
the
first
hymn
was
over
and
held
his
before
his
face
by
way
of
praying
in
secret
before
he
opened
his
a
piece
of
loose
holly
fell
down
from
the
window
ledge
above
him
on
the
exact
middle
of
his
head
and
the
jump
that
he
gave
was
considering
his
baldness
quite
justifiable
captain
puffin
miss
mapp
was
sorry
to
see
was
not
there
at
all
but
he
had
been
unwell
lately
with
attacks
of
dizziness
one
of
which
had
caused
him
in
the
last
game
of
golf
that
he
had
played
to
fall
down
on
the
eleventh
green
and
groan
if
these
attacks
were
not
due
to
his
lack
of
perseverance
no
person
could
fail
to
be
very
sorry
for
him
there
was
a
good
deal
more
peace
on
earth
as
regards
tilling
than
might
have
been
expected
considering
what
the
week
immediately
before
christmas
had
been
like
a
picture
by
miss
coles
who
had
greatly
dropped
out
of
society
lately
owing
to
her
odd
ways
called
adam
which
was
certainly
hopkins
though
no
one
could
have
guessed
had
appeared
for
sale
in
the
window
of
a
dealer
in
pictures
and
curios
but
had
been
withdrawn
from
public
view
at
miss
mapp
personal
intercession
and
her
revelation
of
whom
unlikely
as
it
sounded
the
picture
represented
the
unchivalrous
dealer
had
told
the
artist
the
history
of
its
withdrawal
and
it
had
come
to
miss
mapp
ears
among
many
other
things
that
quaint
irene
had
imitated
the
scene
of
intercession
with
such
piercing
fidelity
that
her
servant
had
nearly
died
of
laughing
then
there
had
been
clandestine
bridge
at
wyse
house
on
three
consecutive
days
and
on
none
of
these
occasions
was
miss
mapp
asked
to
continue
the
instruction
which
she
had
professed
herself
perfectly
willing
to
give
to
the
contessa
the
contessa
in
fact
there
seemed
to
be
no
doubt
about
it
had
declared
that
she
would
sooner
not
play
bridge
at
all
than
play
with
miss
mapp
because
the
effort
of
not
laughing
would
put
an
strain
on
those
muscles
which
prevented
you
from
doing
so
then
the
contessa
had
gone
to
tea
quite
alone
with
major
benjy
and
though
her
shrill
and
senseless
monologue
was
clearly
audible
in
the
street
as
miss
mapp
went
by
to
post
her
letter
again
the
major
dominic
had
stoutly
denied
that
he
was
in
and
the
notion
that
the
contessa
was
haranguing
all
by
herself
in
his
was
too
ridiculous
to
be
entertained
for
a
moment
and
diva
dyed
dress
had
turned
out
so
well
that
miss
mapp
gnashed
her
teeth
at
the
thought
that
she
had
not
had
hers
dyed
instead
with
some
green
chiffon
round
the
neck
even
diva
looked
quite
distinguished
for
diva
then
quite
suddenly
an
angel
of
peace
had
descended
on
the
distracted
for
the
poppits
the
contessa
and
wyse
all
went
away
to
spend
christmas
and
the
new
year
with
the
wyses
of
whitchurch
it
was
probable
that
the
contessa
would
then
continue
a
round
of
visits
with
all
that
coroneted
luggage
and
leave
for
italy
again
without
revisiting
tilling
she
had
behaved
as
if
that
was
the
case
for
taking
advantage
of
a
fine
afternoon
she
had
borrowed
the
royce
and
whirled
round
the
town
on
a
series
of
calls
leaving
cards
everywhere
and
saying
only
so
miss
mapp
gathered
from
withers
your
mistress
not
in
so
sorry
and
had
driven
away
before
withers
could
get
out
the
information
that
her
mistress
was
very
much
in
for
she
had
a
bad
cold
but
there
were
the
cards
and
the
wyses
with
their
future
connections
were
going
to
whitchurch
and
after
a
few
hours
of
rage
against
all
that
had
been
going
on
without
revenge
being
now
possible
and
of
reaction
after
the
excitement
of
it
a
different
reaction
set
in
odd
and
unlikely
as
it
would
have
appeared
a
month
or
two
earlier
when
tilling
was
seething
with
duels
it
was
a
fact
that
it
was
possible
to
have
too
much
excitement
ever
since
the
contessa
had
arrived
she
had
been
like
an
active
volcano
planted
down
among
dangerously
inflammable
elements
and
the
removal
of
it
was
really
a
matter
of
relief
miss
mapp
felt
that
she
would
be
dealing
again
with
materials
whose
properties
she
knew
and
since
no
doubt
the
strain
of
susan
marriage
would
soon
follow
it
was
a
merciful
dispensation
that
the
removal
of
the
volcano
granted
tilling
a
short
restorative
pause
the
young
couple
would
be
back
before
long
and
with
susan
approaching
elevation
certainly
going
to
her
head
and
making
her
talk
in
a
manner
wholly
intolerable
about
the
grandeur
of
the
wyses
of
whitchurch
it
was
a
boon
to
be
allowed
to
recuperate
for
a
little
before
settling
to
work
afresh
to
combat
susan
pretensions
there
was
no
fear
of
being
dull
for
plenty
of
things
had
been
going
on
in
tilling
before
the
contessa
flared
on
the
high
street
and
plenty
of
things
would
continue
to
go
on
after
she
had
taken
her
explosions
elsewhere
by
the
time
that
the
second
lesson
was
being
read
the
sun
had
shifted
from
miss
mapp
face
and
enabled
her
to
see
how
ghastly
dear
evie
looked
when
focussed
under
the
blue
robe
of
jonah
who
was
climbing
out
of
the
whale
she
had
had
her
disappointments
to
contend
with
for
the
contessa
had
never
really
grasped
at
all
who
she
was
sometimes
she
mistook
her
for
irene
sometimes
she
did
not
seem
to
see
her
but
never
had
she
appeared
fully
to
identify
her
as
bartlett
wee
wifey
but
then
dear
evie
was
very
insignificant
even
when
she
squeaked
her
loudest
her
best
friends
among
whom
was
miss
mapp
would
not
deny
that
she
had
been
wilted
by
she
would
recover
again
now
that
they
were
all
left
to
themselves
the
sermon
contained
many
repetitions
and
a
quantity
of
split
infinitives
the
padre
had
once
openly
stated
that
shakespeare
was
good
enough
for
him
and
that
shakespeare
was
guilty
of
many
split
infinitives
on
that
occasion
there
had
nearly
been
a
breach
between
him
and
mistress
mapp
for
mistress
mapp
had
said
but
then
you
are
not
shakespeare
dear
padre
and
he
could
find
nothing
better
to
reply
than
hoots
there
was
nothing
more
of
interest
about
the
sermon
at
the
end
of
the
service
miss
mapp
lingered
in
the
church
looking
at
the
lovely
decorations
of
holly
and
laurel
for
which
she
was
so
largely
responsible
until
her
instinct
assured
her
that
everybody
else
had
shaken
hands
and
was
wondering
what
to
say
next
about
christmas
then
just
then
she
hurried
out
they
were
all
there
and
she
came
like
the
late
and
honoured
guest
poor
diva
diva
darling
she
said
merry
christmas
and
evie
and
the
padre
padre
dear
thank
you
for
your
sermon
and
major
benjy
merry
christmas
major
benjy
what
a
small
company
we
are
but
not
the
less
christmassy
no
wyse
no
susan
no
isabel
oh
and
no
captain
puffin
not
quite
well
again
major
benjy
tell
me
about
him
those
dreadful
fits
of
dizziness
so
hard
to
understand
she
beautifully
succeeded
in
detaching
the
major
from
the
rest
with
the
peace
that
had
descended
on
tilling
she
had
forgiven
him
for
having
been
made
a
fool
of
by
the
contessa
i
anxious
about
my
friend
puffin
he
said
not
at
all
up
to
the
mark
most
depressed
i
told
him
he
had
no
business
to
be
depressed
it
selfish
to
be
depressed
i
said
if
we
were
all
depressed
it
would
be
a
dreary
world
miss
elizabeth
he
sent
for
the
doctor
i
was
to
have
had
a
round
of
golf
with
puffin
this
afternoon
but
he
does
feel
up
to
it
it
would
have
done
him
much
more
good
than
a
host
of
doctors
oh
i
wish
i
could
play
golf
and
not
disappoint
you
of
your
round
major
benjy
said
she
major
benjy
seemed
rather
to
recoil
from
the
thought
he
did
not
profess
at
any
rate
any
sympathetic
regret
and
we
were
going
to
have
had
our
christmas
dinner
together
he
said
and
spend
a
jolly
evening
afterwards
i
sure
quiet
is
the
best
thing
for
captain
puffin
with
his
dizziness
said
miss
mapp
firmly
a
sudden
audacity
seized
her
here
was
the
major
feeling
lonely
as
regards
his
christmas
evening
here
was
she
delighted
that
he
should
not
spend
it
jollily
with
captain
puffin
and
there
was
plenty
of
come
and
have
your
dinner
with
me
she
said
i
alone
too
he
shook
his
head
very
kind
of
you
i
sure
miss
elizabeth
he
said
but
i
think
hold
myself
in
readiness
to
go
across
to
poor
old
puffin
if
he
feels
up
to
it
i
feel
lost
without
my
friend
puffin
but
you
must
have
no
jolly
evening
major
benjy
she
said
so
bad
for
him
a
little
soup
and
a
good
night
rest
that
the
best
thing
perhaps
he
would
like
me
to
go
in
and
read
to
him
i
will
gladly
tell
him
so
from
me
and
if
you
find
he
does
want
anybody
not
even
you
well
there
a
slice
of
at
your
neighbour
and
such
a
warm
welcome
she
stood
on
the
steps
of
her
house
which
in
summer
were
so
crowded
with
sketchers
and
would
have
kissed
her
hand
to
him
had
not
diva
been
following
close
behind
for
even
on
christmas
day
poor
diva
was
capable
of
finding
something
to
say
about
the
most
tender
and
womanly
action
and
miss
mapp
let
herself
into
her
house
with
only
a
little
wave
of
her
hand
somehow
the
idea
that
major
benjy
was
feeling
lonely
and
missing
the
quarrelsome
society
of
his
debauched
friend
was
not
entirely
unpleasing
to
her
it
was
odd
that
there
should
be
anybody
who
missed
captain
puffin
who
would
not
sooner
play
golf
all
alone
if
that
was
possible
than
with
him
or
spend
an
evening
alone
rather
than
with
his
companionship
but
if
captain
puffin
had
to
be
missed
she
would
certainly
have
chosen
major
benjy
to
be
the
person
who
missed
him
without
wishing
captain
puffin
any
unpleasant
experience
she
would
have
borne
with
equanimity
the
news
of
his
settled
melancholia
or
his
permanent
dizziness
for
major
benjy
with
his
bright
robustness
was
not
the
sort
of
man
to
prove
a
willing
comrade
to
a
chronically
dizzy
or
melancholic
friend
nor
would
it
be
right
that
he
should
be
so
men
in
the
prime
of
life
were
not
meant
for
that
nor
were
they
meant
to
be
the
victims
of
designing
women
even
though
wyses
of
whitchurch
he
was
saved
from
that
by
their
most
opportune
departure
in
spite
of
her
readiness
to
be
interrupted
at
any
moment
miss
mapp
spent
a
solitary
evening
she
had
pulled
a
cracker
with
withers
and
severely
jarred
a
tooth
over
a
in
the
but
there
had
been
no
other
events
once
or
twice
in
order
to
see
what
the
night
was
like
she
had
gone
to
the
window
of
the
and
been
aware
that
there
was
a
light
in
major
benjy
house
but
when
ten
struck
she
had
despaired
of
company
and
gone
to
bed
a
little
in
the
streets
gave
her
a
christmas
feeling
and
she
hoped
that
the
singers
got
a
nice
supper
somewhere
miss
mapp
did
not
feel
as
genial
as
usual
when
she
came
down
to
breakfast
next
day
and
omitted
to
say
to
her
rainbow
of
piggies
she
had
run
short
of
wool
for
her
knitting
and
boxing
day
appeared
to
her
a
very
institution
you
would
have
imagined
thought
miss
mapp
as
she
began
cracking
her
egg
that
the
tradespeople
had
had
enough
relaxation
on
christmas
day
especially
when
as
on
this
occasion
it
was
immediately
preceded
by
sunday
and
would
have
been
all
the
better
for
getting
to
work
again
she
never
relaxed
her
efforts
for
a
single
day
in
the
year
and
why
an
overpowering
knocking
on
her
caused
her
to
stop
cracking
her
egg
that
imperious
summons
was
succeeded
by
but
a
moment
of
silence
and
then
it
began
again
she
heard
the
hurried
step
of
withers
across
the
hall
and
almost
before
she
could
have
been
supposed
to
reach
the
front
door
diva
burst
into
the
room
dead
she
said
in
his
soup
captain
puffin
ca
wait
she
whirled
out
again
and
the
front
door
banged
miss
mapp
ate
her
egg
in
three
mouthfuls
had
no
marmalade
at
all
and
putting
on
the
prince
of
wales
cloak
tripped
down
into
the
high
street
though
all
shops
were
shut
evie
was
there
with
her
eagerly
listening
to
what
brace
the
doctor
wife
was
communicating
though
brace
was
not
strictly
speaking
in
society
miss
mapp
waived
all
social
distinctions
and
pressed
her
hand
with
a
mournful
smile
is
it
all
too
terribly
true
she
asked
brace
did
not
take
the
smallest
notice
of
her
and
dropping
her
voice
spoke
to
evie
in
tones
so
low
that
miss
mapp
could
not
catch
a
single
syllable
except
the
word
soup
which
seemed
to
imply
that
diva
had
got
hold
of
some
correct
news
at
last
evie
gave
a
shrill
little
scream
at
the
concluding
words
whatever
they
were
as
brace
hurried
away
miss
mapp
firmly
cornered
evie
and
heard
what
had
happened
captain
puffin
had
gone
up
to
bed
last
night
not
feeling
well
without
having
any
dinner
but
he
had
told
gashly
to
make
him
some
soup
and
he
would
not
want
anything
else
his
had
brought
it
to
him
and
had
soon
afterwards
opened
the
door
to
major
flint
who
learning
that
his
friend
had
gone
to
bed
went
away
she
called
her
master
in
the
morning
and
found
him
sitting
still
dressed
with
his
face
in
the
soup
which
he
had
poured
out
into
a
deep
this
was
very
odd
and
she
had
called
gashly
they
settled
that
he
was
dead
and
rang
up
the
doctor
who
agreed
with
them
it
was
clear
that
captain
puffin
had
had
a
stroke
of
some
sort
and
had
fallen
forward
into
the
soup
which
he
had
just
poured
out
but
he
did
die
of
his
stroke
said
evie
in
a
strangled
whisper
he
was
drowned
drowned
dear
said
miss
mapp
yes
lungs
were
full
of
oh
dear
me
a
stroke
first
and
he
fell
forward
with
his
face
in
his
and
got
his
nose
and
mouth
quite
covered
with
the
soup
he
was
drowned
all
on
dry
land
and
in
his
bedroom
too
terrible
what
dangers
we
are
all
in
she
gave
a
loud
squeak
and
escaped
to
tell
her
husband
diva
had
finished
calling
on
everybody
and
approached
rapidly
he
must
have
died
of
a
stroke
said
diva
very
much
depressed
lately
that
precedes
a
stroke
oh
then
have
you
heard
dear
said
miss
mapp
it
is
all
too
terrible
on
christmas
day
too
suicide
asked
diva
oh
how
shocking
no
dear
it
was
like
this
miss
mapp
got
back
to
her
house
long
before
she
usually
left
it
her
cook
came
up
with
the
proposed
bill
of
fare
for
the
day
that
will
do
for
lunch
said
miss
mapp
but
not
soup
in
the
evening
a
little
fish
from
what
was
left
over
yesterday
and
some
toasted
cheese
that
will
be
plenty
just
a
tray
miss
mapp
went
to
the
and
sat
at
her
window
all
so
sudden
she
said
to
herself
she
sighed
i
daresay
there
may
have
been
much
that
was
good
in
captain
puffin
she
thought
that
we
knew
nothing
about
she
wore
a
wintry
smile
major
benjy
will
feel
very
lonely
she
said
epilogue
miss
mapp
went
to
the
and
sat
at
her
window
it
was
a
warm
bright
day
of
february
and
a
butterfly
was
enjoying
itself
in
the
pale
sunshine
on
the
other
window
and
perhaps
so
miss
mapp
sympathetically
interpreted
its
feelings
was
rather
annoyed
that
it
could
not
fly
away
through
the
pane
it
was
not
a
white
butterfly
but
a
very
pretty
and
in
order
to
let
it
enjoy
itself
more
she
opened
the
window
and
it
fluttered
out
into
the
garden
before
it
had
flown
many
yards
a
starling
ate
most
of
it
up
so
the
starling
enjoyed
itself
too
miss
mapp
fully
shared
in
the
pleasure
first
of
the
and
then
of
the
starling
for
she
was
enjoying
herself
very
much
too
though
her
left
wrist
was
terribly
stiff
but
major
benjy
was
so
cruel
he
insisted
on
her
learning
that
turn
of
the
wrist
which
was
so
important
in
golf
upon
my
word
you
got
it
now
miss
elizabeth
he
had
said
to
her
yesterday
and
then
made
her
do
it
all
over
again
fifty
times
more
such
a
bully
sometimes
she
struck
the
ground
sometimes
she
struck
the
ball
sometimes
she
struck
the
air
but
he
had
been
very
much
pleased
with
her
and
she
was
very
much
pleased
with
him
she
forgot
about
the
butterfly
and
remembered
the
starling
it
was
idle
to
deny
that
the
last
six
weeks
had
been
a
terrific
strain
and
the
strain
on
her
left
wrist
was
nothing
to
them
the
worst
tension
of
all
perhaps
was
when
diva
had
bounced
in
with
the
news
that
the
contessa
was
coming
back
that
was
so
like
diva
the
only
foundation
for
the
report
proved
to
be
that
figgis
had
said
to
her
janet
that
wyse
was
coming
back
and
either
janet
had
misunderstood
figgis
or
diva
far
more
probably
had
misunderstood
janet
and
miss
mapp
only
hoped
that
diva
had
not
done
so
on
purpose
though
it
looked
like
it
stupid
as
poor
diva
undoubtedly
was
it
was
hard
for
charity
itself
to
believe
that
she
had
thought
that
janet
really
said
that
but
when
this
report
proved
to
be
totally
unfounded
miss
mapp
rose
to
the
occasion
and
said
that
diva
had
spoken
out
of
stupidity
and
not
out
of
malice
towards
her
then
in
due
course
wyse
had
come
back
and
the
two
poppits
had
come
back
and
only
three
days
ago
one
poppit
had
become
a
wyse
and
they
had
all
three
gone
for
a
on
the
continent
in
the
royce
very
likely
they
would
go
as
far
south
as
capri
and
susan
would
stay
with
her
new
grand
italian
connections
what
she
would
be
like
when
she
got
back
miss
mapp
forbore
to
conjecture
since
it
was
no
use
anticipating
trouble
but
susan
had
been
so
grandiose
about
the
wyses
multiplying
their
incomes
and
their
acreage
by
fifteen
or
twenty
so
miss
mapp
conjectured
and
talking
so
much
about
county
families
that
the
liveliest
imagination
failed
to
picture
what
she
would
make
of
the
faragliones
she
already
alluded
to
the
count
as
my
cecco
faraglione
but
had
luckily
heard
diva
say
faradiddleony
in
a
loud
aside
which
had
made
her
a
little
more
reticent
susan
had
taken
the
insignia
of
the
member
of
the
british
empire
with
her
as
she
at
once
conceived
the
idea
of
being
presented
to
the
queen
of
italy
by
amelia
and
going
to
a
court
ball
and
isabel
had
taken
her
manuscript
book
of
malaprops
and
spoonerisms
if
she
put
down
all
the
italian
malaprops
that
wyse
would
commit
it
was
likely
that
she
would
bring
back
two
volumes
instead
of
one
though
all
these
grandeurs
were
so
rightly
irritating
the
departure
of
the
young
couple
and
isabel
had
left
tilling
already
shocked
and
shattered
by
the
death
of
captain
puffin
rather
flat
and
purposeless
miss
mapp
alone
refused
to
be
flat
and
had
never
been
so
full
of
purpose
she
felt
that
it
would
be
unpardonably
selfish
of
her
if
she
regarded
for
a
moment
her
own
loss
when
there
was
one
in
tilling
who
suffered
so
much
more
keenly
and
she
set
herself
with
admirable
singleness
of
purpose
to
restore
major
benjy
zest
in
life
and
fill
the
gap
she
wanted
no
assistance
from
others
in
this
diva
for
instance
with
her
jerky
ways
would
be
only
too
apt
to
jar
on
him
and
her
black
dress
might
remind
him
of
his
loss
if
miss
mapp
had
asked
her
to
go
shares
in
the
task
of
making
the
major
evenings
less
lonely
also
the
weather
during
the
whole
of
january
was
particularly
inclement
and
it
would
have
been
too
much
to
expect
of
diva
to
come
all
the
way
up
the
hill
in
the
wet
while
it
was
but
a
step
from
the
door
to
her
own
so
there
was
little
or
nothing
in
the
way
of
as
far
as
miss
mapp
and
the
major
were
concerned
piquet
with
a
single
sympathetic
companion
who
did
not
mind
being
rubiconned
at
threepence
a
hundred
was
as
much
as
he
was
up
to
at
present
with
the
end
of
the
month
a
balmy
foretaste
of
spring
such
as
had
encouraged
the
tortoiseshell
butterfly
to
hope
set
in
and
the
major
used
to
drop
in
after
breakfast
and
stroll
round
the
garden
with
her
smoking
his
pipe
miss
mapp
sweet
snowdrops
had
begun
to
appear
and
green
spikes
of
crocuses
pricked
the
black
earth
and
the
sparrows
were
having
such
fun
in
the
creepers
then
one
day
the
major
who
was
going
out
to
catch
the
tram
had
a
as
miss
mapp
so
foolishly
called
it
with
him
and
a
and
after
making
a
dreadful
hole
in
her
lawn
she
had
hit
the
ball
so
hard
that
it
rebounded
from
the
which
was
quite
a
long
way
off
and
came
back
to
her
very
feet
as
if
asking
to
be
hit
again
by
the
no
she
learned
to
keep
her
wonderfully
observant
eye
on
the
ball
and
bought
one
of
her
own
the
major
lent
her
a
mashie
and
before
anyone
would
have
thought
it
possible
she
had
learned
to
propel
her
ball
right
over
the
bed
where
the
snowdrops
grew
without
beheading
any
of
them
in
its
passage
it
was
the
turn
of
the
wrist
that
did
that
and
withers
cleaned
the
dear
little
mashie
afterwards
and
put
it
safely
in
the
corner
of
the
was
to
be
they
were
to
go
out
to
the
real
links
by
the
tram
consecrated
by
so
many
memories
and
he
was
to
call
for
her
at
eleven
he
had
for
porridge
fully
an
hour
ago
after
letting
out
the
butterfly
from
the
window
looking
into
the
garden
she
moved
across
to
the
post
of
observation
on
the
street
and
arranged
snowdrops
in
a
little
glass
vase
there
were
a
few
over
when
that
was
full
and
she
saw
that
a
reel
of
cotton
was
close
at
hand
in
case
she
had
an
idea
of
what
to
do
with
the
remainder
eleven
chimed
from
the
church
and
on
the
stroke
she
saw
him
coming
up
the
few
yards
of
street
that
separated
his
door
from
hers
so
punctual
so
manly
diva
was
careering
about
the
high
street
as
they
walked
along
it
and
miss
mapp
kissed
her
hand
to
her
off
to
play
golf

she
said

that
not
grand

reservoir
diva
had
not
missed
seeing
the
snowdrops
in
the
major
and
stood
stupefied
for
a
moment
at
this
news
then
she
caught
sight
of
evie
and
shot
across
the
street
to
communicate
her
suspicions
