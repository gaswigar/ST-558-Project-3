childhood

translated

i
the
tutor
karl
ivanitch
on
the
of
august
just
three
days
after
my
tenth
birthday
when
i
had
been
given
such
wonderful
presents
i
was
awakened
at
seven
o
clock
in
the
morning
by
karl
ivanitch
slapping
the
wall
close
to
my
head
with
a
made
of
sugar
paper
and
a
stick
he
did
this
so
roughly
that
he
hit
the
image
of
my
patron
saint
suspended
to
the
oaken
back
of
my
bed
and
the
dead
fly
fell
down
on
my
curls
i
peeped
out
from
under
the
coverlet
steadied
the
still
shaking
image
with
my
hand
flicked
the
dead
fly
on
to
the
floor
and
gazed
at
karl
ivanitch
with
sleepy
wrathful
eyes
he
in
a
wadded
fastened
about
the
waist
with
a
wide
belt
of
the
same
material
a
red
knitted
cap
adorned
with
a
tassel
and
soft
slippers
of
goat
skin
went
on
walking
round
the
walls
and
taking
aim
at
and
slapping
flies
suppose
i
thought
to
myself
that
i
am
only
a
small
boy
yet
why
should
he
disturb
me
why
does
he
not
go
killing
flies
around
woloda
s
bed
no
woloda
is
older
than
i
and
i
am
the
youngest
of
the
family
so
he
torments
me
that
is
what
he
thinks
of
all
day
long
how
to
tease
me
he
knows
very
well
that
he
has
woken
me
up
and
frightened
me
but
he
pretends
not
to
notice
it
disgusting
brute
and
his
and
cap
and
tassel
too
they
are
all
of
them
while
i
was
thus
inwardly
venting
my
wrath
upon
karl
ivanitch
he
had
passed
to
his
own
bedstead
looked
at
his
watch
which
hung
suspended
in
a
little
shoe
sewn
with
bugles
and
deposited
the
on
a
nail
then
evidently
in
the
most
cheerful
mood
possible
he
turned
round
to
us
get
up
children
it
is
quite
time
and
your
mother
is
already
in
the
he
exclaimed
in
his
strong
german
accent
then
he
crossed
over
to
me
sat
down
at
my
feet
and
took
his
out
of
his
pocket
i
pretended
to
be
asleep
karl
ivanitch
sneezed
wiped
his
nose
flicked
his
fingers
and
began
amusing
himself
by
teasing
me
and
tickling
my
toes
as
he
said
with
a
smile
well
well
little
lazy
one
for
all
my
dread
of
being
tickled
i
determined
not
to
get
out
of
bed
or
to
answer
him
but
hid
my
head
deeper
in
the
pillow
kicked
out
with
all
my
strength
and
strained
every
nerve
to
keep
from
laughing
how
kind
he
is
and
how
fond
of
us
i
thought
to
myself
yet
to
think
that
i
could
be
hating
him
so
just
now
i
felt
angry
both
with
myself
and
with
karl
ivanitch
i
wanted
to
laugh
and
to
cry
at
the
same
time
for
my
nerves
were
all
on
edge
leave
me
alone
karl
i
exclaimed
at
length
with
tears
in
my
eyes
as
i
raised
my
head
from
beneath
the
karl
ivanitch
was
taken
aback
he
left
off
tickling
my
feet
and
asked
me
kindly
what
the
matter
was
had
i
had
a
disagreeable
dream
his
good
german
face
and
the
sympathy
with
which
he
sought
to
know
the
cause
of
my
tears
made
them
flow
the
faster
i
felt
and
could
not
understand
how
only
a
minute
ago
i
had
been
hating
karl
and
thinking
his
and
cap
and
tassel
disgusting
on
the
contrary
they
looked
eminently
lovable
now
even
the
tassel
seemed
another
token
of
his
goodness
i
replied
that
i
was
crying
because
i
had
had
a
bad
dream
and
had
seen
mamma
dead
and
being
buried
of
course
it
was
a
mere
invention
since
i
did
not
remember
having
dreamt
anything
at
all
that
night
but
the
truth
was
that
karl
s
sympathy
as
he
tried
to
comfort
and
reassure
me
had
gradually
made
me
believe
that
i
had
dreamt
such
a
horrible
dream
and
so
weep
the
more
though
from
a
different
cause
to
the
one
he
imagined
when
karl
ivanitch
had
left
me
i
sat
up
in
bed
and
proceeded
to
draw
my
stockings
over
my
little
feet
the
tears
had
quite
dried
now
yet
the
mournful
thought
of
the
invented
dream
was
still
haunting
me
a
little
presently
uncle
this
term
is
often
applied
by
children
to
old
servants
in
russia
nicola
came
in
a
neat
little
man
who
was
always
grave
methodical
and
respectful
as
well
as
a
great
friend
of
karl
s
he
brought
with
him
our
clothes
and
boots
at
least
boots
for
woloda
and
for
myself
the
old
detestable
shoes
in
his
presence
i
felt
ashamed
to
cry
and
moreover
the
morning
sun
was
shining
so
gaily
through
the
window
and
woloda
standing
at
the
washstand
as
he
mimicked
maria
ivanovna
my
sister
s
governess
was
laughing
so
loud
and
so
long
that
even
the
serious
nicola
a
towel
over
his
shoulder
the
soap
in
one
hand
and
the
basin
in
the
other
could
not
help
smiling
as
he
said
will
you
please
let
me
wash
you
vladimir
petrovitch
i
had
cheered
up
completely
are
you
nearly
ready
came
karl
s
voice
from
the
schoolroom
the
tone
of
that
voice
sounded
stern
now
and
had
nothing
in
it
of
the
kindness
which
had
just
touched
me
so
much
in
fact
in
the
schoolroom
karl
was
altogether
a
different
man
from
what
he
was
at
other
times
there
he
was
the
tutor
i
washed
and
dressed
myself
hurriedly
and
a
brush
still
in
my
hand
as
i
smoothed
my
wet
hair
answered
to
his
call
karl
with
spectacles
on
nose
and
a
book
in
his
hand
was
sitting
as
usual
between
the
door
and
one
of
the
windows
to
the
left
of
the
door
were
two
shelves
one
of
them
the
children
s
that
is
to
say
ours
and
the
other
one
karl
s
own
upon
ours
were
heaped
all
sorts
of
books
lesson
books
and
play
books
some
standing
up
and
some
lying
down
the
only
two
standing
decorously
against
the
wall
were
two
large
volumes
of
a
histoire
des
voyages
in
red
binding
on
that
shelf
could
be
seen
books
thick
and
thin
and
books
large
and
small
as
well
as
covers
without
books
and
books
without
covers
since
everything
got
crammed
up
together
anyhow
when
play
time
arrived
and
we
were
told
to
put
the
library
as
karl
called
these
shelves
in
order
the
collection
of
books
on
his
own
shelf
was
if
not
so
numerous
as
ours
at
least
more
varied
three
of
them
in
particular
i
remember
namely
a
german
pamphlet
minus
a
cover
on
manuring
cabbages
in
a
history
of
the
seven
years
war
bound
in
parchment
and
burnt
at
one
corner
and
a
course
of
hydrostatics
though
karl
passed
so
much
of
his
time
in
reading
that
he
had
injured
his
sight
by
doing
so
he
never
read
anything
beyond
these
books
and
the
northern
bee
another
article
on
karl
s
shelf
i
remember
well
this
was
a
round
piece
of
cardboard
fastened
by
a
screw
to
a
wooden
stand
with
a
sort
of
comic
picture
of
a
lady
and
a
hairdresser
glued
to
the
cardboard
karl
was
very
clever
at
fixing
pieces
of
cardboard
together
and
had
devised
this
contrivance
for
shielding
his
weak
eyes
from
any
very
strong
light
i
can
see
him
before
me
now
the
tall
figure
in
its
wadded
and
red
cap
a
few
grey
hairs
visible
beneath
the
latter
sitting
beside
the
table
the
screen
with
the
hairdresser
shading
his
face
one
hand
holding
a
book
and
the
other
one
resting
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
before
him
lie
his
watch
with
a
huntsman
painted
on
the
dial
a
check
cotton
handkerchief
a
round
black
and
a
green
the
neatness
and
orderliness
of
all
these
articles
show
clearly
that
karl
ivanitch
has
a
clear
conscience
and
a
quiet
mind
sometimes
when
tired
of
running
about
the
salon
downstairs
i
would
steal
on
tiptoe
to
the
schoolroom
and
find
karl
sitting
alone
in
his
armchair
as
with
a
grave
and
quiet
expression
on
his
face
he
perused
one
of
his
favourite
books
yet
sometimes
also
there
were
moments
when
he
was
not
reading
and
when
the
spectacles
had
slipped
down
his
large
aquiline
nose
and
the
blue
eyes
and
faintly
smiling
lips
seemed
to
be
gazing
before
them
with
a
curious
expression
all
would
be
quiet
in
the
room
not
a
sound
being
audible
save
his
regular
breathing
and
the
ticking
of
the
watch
with
the
hunter
painted
on
the
dial
he
would
not
see
me
and
i
would
stand
at
the
door
and
think
poor
poor
old
man
there
are
many
of
us
and
we
can
play
together
and
be
happy
but
he
sits
there
all
alone
and
has
nobody
to
be
fond
of
him
surely
he
speaks
truth
when
he
says
that
he
is
an
orphan
and
the
story
of
his
life
too
how
terrible
it
is
i
remember
him
telling
it
to
nicola
how
dreadful
to
be
in
his
position
then
i
would
feel
so
sorry
for
him
that
i
would
go
to
him
and
take
his
hand
and
say
dear
karl
ivanitch
and
he
would
be
visibly
delighted
whenever
i
spoke
to
him
like
this
and
would
look
much
brighter
on
the
second
wall
of
the
schoolroom
hung
some
maps
mostly
torn
but
glued
together
again
by
karl
s
hand
on
the
third
wall
in
the
middle
of
which
stood
the
door
hung
on
one
side
of
the
door
a
couple
of
rulers
one
of
them
ours
much
bescratched
and
the
other
one
his
quite
a
new
one
with
on
the
further
side
of
the
door
a
blackboard
on
which
our
more
serious
faults
were
marked
by
circles
and
our
lesser
faults
by
crosses
to
the
left
of
the
blackboard
was
the
corner
in
which
we
had
to
kneel
when
naughty
how
well
i
remember
that
corner
the
shutter
on
the
stove
the
ventilator
above
it
and
the
noise
which
it
made
when
turned
sometimes
i
would
be
made
to
stay
in
that
corner
till
my
back
and
knees
were
aching
all
over
and
i
would
think
to
myself
has
karl
ivanitch
forgotten
me
he
goes
on
sitting
quietly
in
his
and
reading
his
hydrostatics
while
i
then
to
remind
him
of
my
presence
i
would
begin
gently
turning
the
ventilator
round
or
scratching
some
plaster
off
the
wall
but
if
by
chance
an
extra
large
piece
fell
upon
the
floor
the
fright
of
it
was
worse
than
any
punishment
i
would
glance
round
at
karl
but
he
would
still
be
sitting
there
quietly
book
in
hand
and
pretending
that
he
had
noticed
nothing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
stood
a
table
covered
with
a
torn
black
oilcloth
so
much
cut
about
with
penknives
that
the
edge
of
the
table
showed
through
round
the
table
stood
unpainted
chairs
which
through
use
had
attained
a
high
degree
of
polish
the
fourth
and
last
wall
contained
three
windows
from
the
first
of
which
the
view
was
as
follows
immediately
beneath
it
there
ran
a
high
road
on
which
every
irregularity
every
pebble
every
rut
was
known
and
dear
to
me
beside
the
road
stretched
a
row
of
through
which
glimpses
could
be
caught
of
a
wattled
fence
with
a
meadow
with
farm
buildings
on
one
side
of
it
and
a
wood
on
the
other
the
whole
bounded
by
the
keeper
s
hut
at
the
further
end
of
the
meadow
the
next
window
to
the
right
overlooked
the
part
of
the
terrace
where
the
grownups
of
the
family
used
to
sit
before
luncheon
sometimes
when
karl
was
correcting
our
exercises
i
would
look
out
of
that
window
and
see
mamma
s
dark
hair
and
the
backs
of
some
persons
with
her
and
hear
the
murmur
of
their
talking
and
laughter
then
i
would
feel
vexed
that
i
could
not
be
there
too
and
think
to
myself
when
am
i
going
to
be
grown
up
and
to
have
no
more
lessons
but
sit
with
the
people
whom
i
love
instead
of
with
these
horrid
dialogues
in
my
hand
then
my
anger
would
change
to
sadness
and
i
would
fall
into
such
a
reverie
that
i
never
heard
karl
when
he
scolded
me
for
my
mistakes
at
last
on
the
morning
of
which
i
am
speaking
karl
ivanitch
took
off
his
put
on
his
blue
frockcoat
with
its
creased
and
crumpled
shoulders
adjusted
his
tie
before
the
and
took
us
down
to
greet
mamma
ii
mamma
mamma
was
sitting
in
the
and
making
tea
in
one
hand
she
was
holding
the
while
with
the
other
one
she
was
drawing
water
from
the
urn
and
letting
it
drip
into
the
tray
yet
though
she
appeared
to
be
noticing
what
she
doing
in
reality
she
noted
neither
this
fact
nor
our
entry
however
vivid
be
one
s
recollection
of
the
past
any
attempt
to
recall
the
features
of
a
beloved
being
shows
them
to
one
s
vision
as
through
a
mist
of
tears
dim
and
blurred
those
tears
are
the
tears
of
the
imagination
when
i
try
to
recall
mamma
as
she
was
then
i
see
true
her
brown
eyes
expressive
always
of
love
and
kindness
the
small
mole
on
her
neck
below
where
the
small
hairs
grow
her
white
embroidered
collar
and
the
delicate
fresh
hand
which
so
often
caressed
me
and
which
i
so
often
kissed
but
her
general
appearance
escapes
me
altogether
to
the
left
of
the
sofa
stood
an
english
piano
at
which
my
sister
lubotshka
was
sitting
and
playing
with
manifest
effort
for
her
hands
were
rosy
from
a
recent
washing
in
cold
water
clementi
s
then
eleven
years
old
she
was
dressed
in
a
short
cotton
frock
and
white
trousers
and
could
take
her
octaves
only
in
arpeggio
beside
her
was
sitting
maria
ivanovna
in
a
cap
adorned
with
pink
ribbons
and
a
blue
shawl
her
face
was
red
and
cross
and
it
assumed
an
expression
even
more
severe
when
karl
ivanitch
entered
the
room
looking
angrily
at
him
without
answering
his
bow
she
went
on
beating
time
with
her
foot
and
counting
one
two
three
one
two
three
more
loudly
and
commandingly
than
ever
karl
ivanitch
paid
no
attention
to
this
rudeness
but
went
as
usual
with
german
politeness
to
kiss
mamma
s
hand
she
drew
herself
up
shook
her
head
as
though
by
the
movement
to
chase
away
sad
thoughts
from
her
and
gave
karl
her
hand
kissing
him
on
his
wrinkled
temple
as
he
bent
his
head
in
salutation
i
thank
you
dear
karl
ivanitch
she
said
in
german
and
then
still
using
the
same
language
asked
him
how
we
the
children
had
slept
karl
ivanitch
was
deaf
in
one
ear
and
the
added
noise
of
the
piano
now
prevented
him
from
hearing
anything
at
all
he
moved
nearer
to
the
sofa
and
leaning
one
hand
upon
the
table
and
lifting
his
cap
above
his
head
said
with
a
smile
which
in
those
days
always
seemed
to
me
the
perfection
of
politeness
you
will
excuse
me
will
you
not
natalia
nicolaevna
the
reason
for
this
was
that
to
avoid
catching
cold
karl
never
took
off
his
red
cap
but
invariably
asked
permission
on
entering
the
to
retain
it
on
his
head
yes
pray
replace
it
karl
ivanitch
said
mamma
bending
towards
him
and
raising
her
voice
but
i
asked
you
whether
the
children
had
slept
well
still
he
did
not
hear
but
covering
his
bald
head
again
with
the
red
cap
went
on
smiling
more
than
ever
stop
a
moment
mimi
said
mamma
now
smiling
also
to
maria
ivanovna
it
is
impossible
to
hear
how
beautiful
mamma
s
face
was
when
she
smiled
it
made
her
so
infinitely
more
charming
and
everything
around
her
seemed
to
grow
brighter
if
in
the
more
painful
moments
of
my
life
i
could
have
seen
that
smile
before
my
eyes
i
should
never
have
known
what
grief
is
in
my
opinion
it
is
in
the
smile
of
a
face
that
the
essence
of
what
we
call
beauty
lies
if
the
smile
heightens
the
charm
of
the
face
then
the
face
is
a
beautiful
one
if
the
smile
does
not
alter
the
face
then
the
face
is
an
ordinary
one
but
if
the
smile
spoils
the
face
then
the
face
is
an
ugly
one
indeed
mamma
took
my
head
between
her
hands
bent
it
gently
backwards
looked
at
me
gravely
and
said
you
have
been
crying
this
morning
i
did
not
answer
she
kissed
my
eyes
and
said
again
in
german
why
did
you
cry
when
talking
to
us
with
particular
intimacy
she
always
used
this
language
which
she
knew
to
perfection
i
cried
about
a
dream
mamma
i
replied
remembering
the
invented
vision
and
trembling
involuntarily
at
the
recollection
karl
ivanitch
confirmed
my
words
but
said
nothing
as
to
the
subject
of
the
dream
then
after
a
little
conversation
on
the
weather
in
which
mimi
also
took
part
mamma
laid
some
lumps
of
sugar
on
the
tray
for
one
or
two
of
the
more
privileged
servants
and
crossed
over
to
her
embroidery
frame
which
stood
near
one
of
the
windows
go
to
papa
now
children
she
said
and
ask
him
to
come
to
me
before
he
goes
to
the
home
then
the
music
the
counting
and
the
wrathful
looks
from
mimi
began
again
and
we
went
off
to
see
papa
passing
through
the
room
which
had
been
known
ever
since
grandpapa
s
time
as
the
pantry
we
entered
the
study
iii
papa
he
was
standing
near
his
and
pointing
angrily
to
some
envelopes
papers
and
little
piles
of
coin
upon
it
as
he
addressed
some
observations
to
the
bailiff
jakoff
michaelovitch
who
was
standing
in
his
usual
place
that
is
to
say
between
the
door
and
the
barometer
and
rapidly
closing
and
unclosing
the
fingers
of
the
hand
which
he
held
behind
his
back
the
more
angry
papa
grew
the
more
rapidly
did
those
fingers
twirl
and
when
papa
ceased
speaking
they
came
to
rest
also
yet
as
soon
as
ever
jakoff
himself
began
to
talk
they
flew
here
there
and
everywhere
with
lightning
rapidity
these
movements
always
appeared
to
me
an
index
of
jakoff
s
secret
thoughts
though
his
face
was
invariably
placid
and
expressive
alike
of
dignity
and
submissiveness
as
who
should
say
i
am
right
yet
let
it
be
as
you
on
seeing
us
papa
said
directly
wait
a
moment
and
looked
towards
the
door
as
a
hint
for
it
to
be
shut
gracious
heavens
what
can
be
the
matter
with
you
jakoff
he
went
on
with
a
hitch
of
one
shoulder
a
habit
of
his
this
envelope
here
with
the
roubles
enclosed
jacob
took
out
a
set
of
tablets
put
down
and
remained
looking
at
the
figures
while
he
waited
for
what
was
to
come
next
is
for
expenses
during
my
absence
do
you
understand
from
the
mill
you
ought
to
receive
roubles
is
not
that
so
and
from
the
treasury
mortgage
you
ought
to
receive
some
roubles
from
the
hay
of
which
according
to
your
calculations
we
shall
be
able
to
sell
poods
the
pood
lbs
at
copecks
a
piece
there
should
come
in
consequently
the
that
you
ought
to
have
in
hand
soon
is
how
much
roubles
is
that
right
precisely
answered
jakoff
yet
by
the
extreme
rapidity
with
which
his
fingers
were
twitching
i
could
see
that
he
had
an
objection
to
make
papa
went
on
well
of
this
money
you
will
send
roubles
to
the
petrovskoe
local
council
as
for
the
money
already
at
the
office
you
will
remit
it
to
me
and
enter
it
as
spent
on
this
present
jakoff
turned
over
the
tablet
marked
and
put
down
seeming
by
his
action
to
imply
that
roubles
had
been
turned
over
in
the
same
fashion
as
he
had
turned
the
tablet
and
this
envelope
with
the
enclosed
money
concluded
papa
you
will
deliver
for
me
to
the
person
to
whom
it
is
i
was
standing
close
to
the
table
and
could
see
the
address
it
was
to
karl
ivanitch
perhaps
papa
had
an
idea
that
i
had
read
something
which
i
ought
not
for
he
touched
my
shoulder
with
his
hand
and
made
me
aware
by
a
slight
movement
that
i
must
withdraw
from
the
table
not
sure
whether
the
movement
was
meant
for
a
caress
or
a
command
i
kissed
the
large
sinewy
hand
which
rested
upon
my
shoulder
very
well
said
jakoff
and
what
are
your
orders
about
the
accounts
for
the
money
from
chabarovska
chabarovska
was
mamma
s
village
only
that
they
are
to
remain
in
my
office
and
not
to
be
taken
thence
without
my
express
for
a
minute
or
two
jakoff
was
silent
then
his
fingers
began
to
twitch
with
extraordinary
rapidity
and
changing
the
expression
of
deferential
vacancy
with
which
he
had
listened
to
his
orders
for
one
of
shrewd
intelligence
he
turned
his
tablets
back
and
spoke
will
you
allow
me
to
inform
you
peter
alexandritch
he
said
with
frequent
pauses
between
his
words
that
however
much
you
wish
it
it
is
out
of
the
question
to
repay
the
local
council
now
you
enumerated
some
items
i
think
as
to
what
ought
to
come
in
from
the
mortgage
the
mill
and
the
hay
he
jotted
down
each
of
these
items
on
his
tablets
again
as
he
spoke
yet
i
fear
that
we
must
have
made
a
mistake
somewhere
in
the
here
he
paused
a
while
and
looked
gravely
at
papa
how
so
well
will
you
be
good
enough
to
look
for
yourself
there
is
the
account
for
the
mill
the
miller
has
been
to
me
twice
to
ask
for
time
and
i
am
afraid
that
he
has
no
money
whatever
in
hand
he
is
here
now
would
you
like
to
speak
to
him
no
tell
me
what
he
says
replied
papa
showing
by
a
movement
of
his
head
that
he
had
no
desire
to
have
speech
with
the
miller
well
it
is
easy
enough
to
guess
what
he
says
he
declares
that
there
is
no
grinding
to
be
got
now
and
that
his
last
remaining
money
has
gone
to
pay
for
the
dam
what
good
would
it
do
for
us
to
turn
him
out
as
to
what
you
were
pleased
to
say
about
the
mortgage
you
yourself
are
aware
that
your
money
there
is
locked
up
and
can
not
be
recovered
at
a
moment
s
notice
i
was
sending
a
load
of
flour
to
ivan
afanovitch
and
sent
him
a
letter
as
well
to
which
he
replies
that
he
would
have
been
glad
to
oblige
you
peter
alexandritch
were
it
not
that
the
matter
is
out
of
his
hands
now
and
that
all
the
circumstances
show
that
it
would
take
you
at
least
two
months
to
withdraw
the
money
from
the
hay
i
understood
you
to
estimate
a
return
of
roubles
here
jakoff
jotted
down
on
his
tablets
and
then
looked
for
a
moment
from
the
figures
to
papa
with
a
peculiar
expression
on
his
face
well
surely
you
see
for
yourself
how
little
that
is
and
even
then
we
should
lose
if
we
were
to
sell
the
stuff
now
for
you
must
know
that
it
was
clear
that
he
would
have
had
many
other
arguments
to
adduce
had
not
papa
interrupted
him
i
can
not
make
any
change
in
my
arrangements
said
papa
yet
if
there
should
really
have
to
be
any
delay
in
the
recovery
of
these
sums
we
could
borrow
what
we
wanted
from
the
chabarovska
very
well
the
expression
of
jakoff
s
face
and
the
way
in
which
he
twitched
his
fingers
showed
that
this
order
had
given
him
great
satisfaction
he
was
a
serf
and
a
most
zealous
devoted
one
but
like
all
good
bailiffs
exacting
and
parsimonious
to
a
degree
in
the
interests
of
his
master
moreover
he
had
some
queer
notions
of
his
own
he
was
forever
endeavouring
to
increase
his
master
s
property
at
the
expense
of
his
mistress
s
and
to
prove
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
avoid
using
the
rents
from
her
estates
for
the
benefit
of
petrovskoe
my
father
s
village
and
the
place
where
we
lived
this
point
he
had
now
gained
and
was
delighted
in
consequence
papa
then
greeted
ourselves
and
said
that
if
we
stayed
much
longer
in
the
country
we
should
become
lazy
boys
that
we
were
growing
quite
big
now
and
must
set
about
doing
lessons
in
earnest
i
suppose
you
know
that
i
am
starting
for
moscow
he
went
on
and
that
i
am
going
to
take
you
with
me
you
will
live
with
grandmamma
but
mamma
and
the
girls
will
remain
here
you
know
too
i
am
sure
that
mamma
s
one
consolation
will
be
to
hear
that
you
are
doing
your
lessons
well
and
pleasing
every
one
around
the
preparations
which
had
been
in
progress
for
some
days
past
had
made
us
expect
some
unusual
event
but
this
news
left
us
thunderstruck
woloda
turned
red
and
with
a
shaking
voice
delivered
mamma
s
message
to
papa
so
this
was
what
my
dream
foreboded
i
thought
to
myself
god
send
that
there
come
nothing
worse
i
felt
terribly
sorry
to
have
to
leave
mamma
but
at
the
same
rejoiced
to
think
that
i
should
soon
be
grown
up
if
we
are
going
we
shall
probably
have
no
lessons
to
do
and
that
will
be
splendid
however
i
am
sorry
for
karl
ivanitch
for
he
will
certainly
be
dismissed
now
that
was
why
that
envelope
had
been
prepared
for
him
i
think
i
would
almost
rather
stay
and
do
lessons
here
than
leave
mamma
or
hurt
poor
karl
he
is
miserable
enough
as
these
thoughts
crossed
my
mind
i
stood
looking
sadly
at
the
black
ribbons
on
my
shoes
after
a
few
words
to
karl
ivanitch
about
the
depression
of
the
barometer
and
an
injunction
to
jakoff
not
to
feed
the
hounds
since
a
farewell
meet
was
to
be
held
after
luncheon
papa
disappointed
my
hopes
by
sending
us
off
to
lessons
though
he
also
consoled
us
by
promising
to
take
us
out
hunting
later
on
my
way
upstairs
i
made
a
digression
to
the
terrace
near
the
door
leading
on
to
it
papa
s
favourite
hound
milka
was
lying
in
the
sun
and
blinking
her
eyes
miloshka
i
cried
as
i
caressed
her
and
kissed
her
nose
we
are
going
away
today
perhaps
we
shall
never
see
each
other
i
was
crying
and
laughing
at
the
same
time
iv
lessons
karl
ivanitch
was
in
a
bad
temper
this
was
clear
from
his
contracted
brows
and
from
the
way
in
which
he
flung
his
frockcoat
into
a
drawer
angrily
donned
his
old
again
and
made
deep
dints
with
his
nails
to
mark
the
place
in
the
book
of
dialogues
to
which
we
were
to
learn
by
heart
woloda
began
working
diligently
but
i
was
too
distracted
to
do
anything
at
all
for
a
long
while
i
stared
vacantly
at
the
book
but
tears
at
the
thought
of
the
impending
separation
kept
rushing
to
my
eyes
and
preventing
me
from
reading
a
single
word
when
at
length
the
time
came
to
repeat
the
dialogues
to
karl
who
listened
to
us
with
blinking
eyes
a
very
bad
sign
i
had
no
sooner
reached
the
place
where
some
one
asks
wo
kommen
sie
her
where
do
you
come
from
and
some
one
else
answers
him
ich
komme
vom
kaffeehaus
i
come
from
the
than
i
burst
into
tears
and
for
sobbing
could
not
pronounce
haben
sie
die
zeitung
nicht
gelesen
have
you
not
read
the
newspaper
at
all
next
when
we
came
to
our
writing
lesson
the
tears
kept
falling
from
my
eyes
and
making
a
mess
on
the
paper
as
though
some
one
had
written
on
with
water
karl
was
very
angry
he
ordered
me
to
go
down
upon
my
knees
declared
that
it
was
all
obstinacy
and
playing
a
favourite
expression
of
his
on
my
part
threatened
me
with
the
ruler
and
commanded
me
to
say
that
i
was
sorry
yet
for
sobbing
and
crying
i
could
not
get
a
word
out
at
last
conscious
perhaps
that
he
was
unjust
he
departed
to
nicola
s
pantry
and
slammed
the
door
behind
him
nevertheless
their
conversation
there
carried
to
the
schoolroom
have
you
heard
that
the
children
are
going
to
moscow
nicola
said
karl
yes
how
could
i
help
hearing
it
at
this
point
nicola
seemed
to
get
up
for
karl
said
sit
down
nicola
and
then
locked
the
door
however
i
came
out
of
my
corner
and
crept
to
the
door
to
listen
however
much
you
may
do
for
people
and
however
fond
of
them
you
may
be
never
expect
any
gratitude
nicola
said
karl
warmly
nicola
who
was
by
the
window
nodded
his
head
in
assent
twelve
years
have
i
lived
in
this
house
went
on
karl
lifting
his
eyes
and
his
towards
the
ceiling
and
before
god
i
can
say
that
i
have
loved
them
and
worked
for
them
even
more
than
if
they
had
been
my
own
children
you
recollect
nicola
when
woloda
had
the
fever
you
recollect
how
for
nine
days
and
nights
i
never
closed
my
eyes
as
i
sat
beside
his
bed
yes
at
that
time
i
was
the
dear
good
karl
ivanitch
i
was
wanted
then
but
now
and
he
smiled
ironically
the
children
are
growing
up
and
must
go
to
study
in
earnest
perhaps
they
never
learnt
anything
with
me
nicola
eh
i
am
sure
they
did
replied
nicola
laying
his
awl
down
and
straightening
a
piece
of
thread
with
his
hands
no
i
am
wanted
no
longer
and
am
to
be
turned
out
what
good
are
promises
and
gratitude
natalia
nicolaevna
here
he
laid
his
hand
upon
his
heart
i
love
and
revere
but
what
can
she
i
do
here
her
will
is
powerless
in
this
he
flung
a
strip
of
leather
on
the
floor
with
an
angry
gesture
yet
i
know
who
has
been
playing
tricks
here
and
why
i
am
no
longer
wanted
it
is
because
i
do
not
flatter
and
toady
as
certain
people
do
i
am
in
the
habit
of
speaking
the
truth
in
all
places
and
to
all
persons
he
continued
proudly
god
be
with
these
children
for
my
leaving
them
will
benefit
them
little
whereas
i
well
by
god
s
help
i
may
be
able
to
earn
a
crust
of
bread
somewhere
nicola
eh
nicola
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
karl
as
though
to
consider
whether
he
would
indeed
be
able
to
earn
a
crust
of
bread
but
he
said
nothing
karl
said
a
great
deal
more
of
the
same
kind
in
particular
how
much
better
his
services
had
been
appreciated
at
a
certain
general
s
where
he
had
formerly
lived
i
regretted
to
hear
that
likewise
he
spoke
of
saxony
his
parents
his
friend
the
tailor
schonheit
beauty
and
so
on
i
sympathised
with
his
distress
and
felt
dreadfully
sorry
that
he
and
papa
both
of
whom
i
loved
about
equally
had
had
a
difference
then
i
returned
to
my
corner
crouched
down
upon
my
heels
and
fell
to
thinking
how
a
reconciliation
between
them
might
be
effected
returning
to
the
study
karl
ordered
me
to
get
up
and
prepare
to
write
from
dictation
when
i
was
ready
he
sat
down
with
a
dignified
air
in
his
and
in
a
voice
which
seemed
to
come
from
a
profound
abyss
began
to
dictate
von
die
ist
have
you
written
that
he
paused
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
began
again
die
grausamste
ist
die
the
most
cruel
of
all
passions
is
ingratitude
a
capital
u
the
last
word
written
i
looked
at
him
for
him
to
go
on
punctum
stop
he
concluded
with
a
faintly
perceptible
smile
as
he
signed
to
us
to
hand
him
our
several
times
and
in
several
different
tones
and
always
with
an
expression
of
the
greatest
satisfaction
did
he
read
out
that
sentence
which
expressed
his
predominant
thought
at
the
moment
then
he
set
us
to
learn
a
lesson
in
history
and
sat
down
near
the
window
his
face
did
not
look
so
depressed
now
but
on
the
contrary
expressed
eloquently
the
satisfaction
of
a
man
who
had
avenged
himself
for
an
injury
dealt
him
by
this
time
it
was
a
quarter
to
one
o
clock
but
karl
ivanitch
never
thought
of
releasing
us
he
merely
set
us
a
new
lesson
to
learn
my
fatigue
and
hunger
were
increasing
in
equal
proportions
so
that
i
eagerly
followed
every
sign
of
the
approach
of
luncheon
first
came
the
housemaid
with
a
cloth
to
wipe
the
plates
next
the
sound
of
crockery
resounded
in
the
as
the
table
was
moved
and
chairs
placed
round
it
after
that
mimi
lubotshka
and
katenka
katenka
was
mimi
s
daughter
and
twelve
years
old
came
in
from
the
garden
but
foka
the
servant
who
always
used
to
come
and
announce
luncheon
was
not
yet
to
be
seen
only
when
he
entered
was
it
lawful
to
throw
one
s
books
aside
and
run
downstairs
hark
steps
resounded
on
the
staircase
but
they
were
not
foka
s
foka
s
i
had
learnt
to
study
and
knew
the
creaking
of
his
boots
well
the
door
opened
and
a
figure
unknown
to
me
made
its
appearance
v
the
idiot
the
man
who
now
entered
the
room
was
about
fifty
years
old
with
a
pale
attenuated
face
pitted
with
smallpox
long
grey
hair
and
a
scanty
beard
of
a
reddish
hue
likewise
he
was
so
tall
that
on
coming
through
the
doorway
he
was
forced
not
only
to
bend
his
head
but
to
incline
his
whole
body
forward
he
was
dressed
in
a
sort
of
smock
that
was
much
torn
and
held
in
his
hand
a
stout
staff
as
he
entered
he
smote
this
staff
upon
the
floor
and
contracting
his
brows
and
opening
his
mouth
to
its
fullest
extent
laughed
in
a
dreadful
unnatural
way
he
had
lost
the
sight
of
one
eye
and
its
colourless
pupil
kept
rolling
about
and
imparting
to
his
hideous
face
an
even
more
repellent
expression
than
it
otherwise
bore
hullo
you
are
caught
he
exclaimed
as
he
ran
to
woloda
with
little
short
steps
and
seizing
him
round
the
head
looked
at
it
searchingly
next
he
left
him
went
to
the
table
and
with
a
perfectly
serious
expression
on
his
face
began
to
blow
under
the
and
to
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
it
what
a
pity
how
it
hurts
they
are
angry
they
fly
from
me
he
exclaimed
in
a
tearful
choking
voice
as
he
glared
at
woloda
and
wiped
away
the
streaming
tears
with
his
sleeve
his
voice
was
harsh
and
rough
all
his
movements
hysterical
and
spasmodic
and
his
words
devoid
of
sense
or
connection
for
he
used
no
conjunctions
yet
the
tone
of
that
voice
was
so
heartrending
and
his
yellow
deformed
face
at
times
so
sincere
and
pitiful
in
its
expression
that
as
one
listened
to
him
it
was
impossible
to
repress
a
mingled
sensation
of
pity
grief
and
fear
this
was
the
idiot
grisha
whence
he
had
come
or
who
were
his
parents
or
what
had
induced
him
to
choose
the
strange
life
which
he
led
no
one
ever
knew
all
that
i
myself
knew
was
that
from
his
fifteenth
year
upwards
he
had
been
known
as
an
imbecile
who
went
barefooted
both
in
winter
and
summer
visited
convents
gave
little
images
to
any
one
who
cared
to
take
them
and
spoke
meaningless
words
which
some
people
took
for
prophecies
that
nobody
remembered
him
as
being
different
that
at
rare
intervals
he
used
to
call
at
grandmamma
s
house
and
that
by
some
people
he
was
said
to
be
the
outcast
son
of
rich
parents
and
a
pure
saintly
soul
while
others
averred
that
he
was
a
mere
peasant
and
an
idler
at
last
the
punctual
and
foka
arrived
and
we
went
downstairs
grisha
followed
us
sobbing
and
continuing
to
talk
nonsense
and
knocking
his
staff
on
each
step
of
the
staircase
when
we
entered
the
we
found
papa
and
mamma
walking
up
and
down
there
with
their
hands
clasped
in
each
other
s
and
talking
in
low
tones
maria
ivanovna
was
sitting
bolt
upright
in
an
placed
at
tight
angles
to
the
sofa
and
giving
some
sort
of
a
lesson
to
the
two
girls
sitting
beside
her
when
karl
ivanitch
entered
the
room
she
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
and
then
turned
her
eyes
away
with
an
expression
which
seemed
to
say
you
are
beneath
my
notice
karl
it
was
easy
to
see
from
the
girls
eyes
that
they
had
important
news
to
communicate
to
us
as
soon
as
an
opportunity
occurred
for
to
leave
their
seats
and
approach
us
first
was
contrary
to
mimi
s
rules
it
was
for
us
to
go
to
her
and
say
bon
jour
mimi
and
then
make
her
a
low
bow
after
which
we
should
possibly
be
permitted
to
enter
into
conversation
with
the
girls
what
an
intolerable
creature
that
mimi
was
one
could
hardly
say
a
word
in
her
presence
without
being
found
fault
with
also
whenever
we
wanted
to
speak
in
russian
she
would
say
parlez
donc
francais
as
though
on
purpose
to
annoy
us
while
if
there
was
any
particularly
nice
dish
at
luncheon
which
we
wished
to
enjoy
in
peace
she
would
keep
on
ejaculating
mangez
donc
avec
du
pain
or
comment
que
vous
tenez
votre
fourchette
what
has
she
got
to
do
with
us
i
used
to
think
to
myself
let
her
teach
the
girls
we
have
our
karl
i
shared
to
the
full
his
dislike
of
certain
ask
mamma
to
let
us
go
hunting
too
katenka
whispered
to
me
as
she
caught
me
by
the
sleeve
just
when
the
elders
of
the
family
were
making
a
move
towards
the
very
well
i
will
grisha
likewise
took
a
seat
in
the
but
at
a
little
table
apart
from
the
rest
he
never
lifted
his
eyes
from
his
plate
but
kept
on
sighing
and
making
horrible
grimaces
as
he
muttered
to
himself
what
a
pity
it
has
flown
away
the
dove
is
flying
to
heaven
the
stone
lies
on
the
tomb
and
so
forth
ever
since
the
morning
mamma
had
been
and
grisha
s
presence
words
and
actions
seemed
to
make
her
more
so
by
the
way
there
is
something
i
forgot
to
ask
you
she
said
as
she
handed
papa
a
plate
of
soup
what
is
it
that
you
will
have
those
dreadful
dogs
of
yours
tied
up
they
nearly
worried
poor
grisha
to
death
when
he
entered
the
courtyard
and
i
am
sure
they
will
bite
the
children
some
no
sooner
did
grisha
hear
himself
mentioned
that
he
turned
towards
our
table
and
showed
us
his
torn
clothes
then
as
he
went
on
with
his
meal
he
said
he
would
have
let
them
tear
me
in
pieces
but
god
would
not
allow
it
what
a
sin
to
let
the
dogs
loose
a
great
sin
but
do
not
beat
him
master
do
not
beat
him
it
is
for
god
to
forgive
it
is
past
now
what
does
he
say
said
papa
looking
at
him
gravely
and
sternly
i
can
not
understand
him
at
i
think
he
is
saying
replied
mamma
that
one
of
the
huntsmen
set
the
dogs
on
him
but
that
god
would
not
allow
him
to
be
torn
in
pieces
therefore
he
begs
you
not
to
punish
the
oh
is
that
it
said
papa
how
does
he
know
that
i
intended
to
punish
the
huntsman
you
know
i
am
not
very
fond
of
fellows
like
this
he
added
in
french
and
this
one
offends
me
particularly
should
it
ever
happen
that
oh
don
t
say
so
interrupted
mamma
as
if
frightened
by
some
thought
how
can
you
know
what
he
is
i
think
i
have
plenty
of
opportunities
for
doing
so
since
no
lack
of
them
come
to
see
you
all
of
them
the
same
sort
and
probably
all
with
the
same
i
could
see
that
mamma
s
opinion
differed
from
his
but
that
she
did
not
mean
to
quarrel
about
it
please
hand
me
the
cakes
she
said
to
him
are
they
good
or
not
yes
i
am
angry
he
went
on
as
he
took
the
cakes
and
put
them
where
mamma
could
not
reach
them
very
angry
at
seeing
supposedly
reasonable
and
educated
people
let
themselves
be
deceived
and
he
struck
the
table
with
his
fork
i
asked
you
to
hand
me
the
cakes
she
repeated
with
outstretched
hand
and
it
is
a
good
thing
papa
continued
as
he
put
the
hand
aside
that
the
police
run
such
vagabonds
in
all
they
are
good
for
is
to
play
upon
the
nerves
of
certain
people
who
are
already
not
in
that
respect
and
he
smiled
observing
that
mamma
did
not
like
the
conversation
at
all
however
he
handed
her
the
cakes
all
that
i
have
to
say
she
replied
is
that
one
can
hardly
believe
that
a
man
who
though
sixty
years
of
age
goes
barefooted
winter
and
summer
and
always
wears
chains
of
two
pounds
weight
and
never
accepts
the
offers
made
to
him
to
live
a
quiet
comfortable
life
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
such
a
man
should
act
thus
out
of
pausing
a
moment
she
added
with
a
sigh
as
to
predictions
je
suis
payee
pour
y
croire
i
told
you
i
think
that
grisha
prophesied
the
very
day
and
hour
of
poor
papa
s
death
oh
what
have
you
gone
and
done
said
papa
laughing
and
putting
his
hand
to
his
cheek
whenever
he
did
this
i
used
to
look
for
something
particularly
comical
from
him
why
did
you
call
my
attention
to
his
feet
i
looked
at
them
and
now
can
eat
nothing
luncheon
was
over
now
and
lubotshka
and
katenka
were
winking
at
us
fidgeting
about
in
their
chairs
and
showing
great
restlessness
the
winking
of
course
signified
why
don
t
you
ask
whether
we
too
may
go
to
the
hunt
i
nudged
woloda
and
woloda
nudged
me
back
until
at
last
i
took
heart
of
grace
and
began
at
first
shyly
but
gradually
with
more
assurance
to
ask
if
it
would
matter
much
if
the
girls
too
were
allowed
to
enjoy
the
sport
thereupon
a
consultation
was
held
among
the
elder
folks
and
eventually
leave
was
granted
mamma
to
make
things
still
more
delightful
saying
that
she
would
come
too
vi
preparations
for
the
chase
during
dessert
jakoff
had
been
sent
for
and
orders
given
him
to
have
ready
the
carriage
the
hounds
and
the
every
detail
being
minutely
specified
and
every
horse
called
by
its
own
particular
name
as
woloda
s
usual
mount
was
lame
papa
ordered
a
hunter
to
be
saddled
for
him
which
term
hunter
so
horrified
mamma
s
ears
that
she
imagined
it
to
be
some
kind
of
an
animal
which
would
at
once
run
away
and
bring
about
woloda
s
death
consequently
in
spite
of
all
papa
s
and
woloda
s
assurances
the
latter
glibly
affirming
that
it
was
nothing
and
that
he
liked
his
horse
to
go
fast
poor
mamma
continued
to
exclaim
that
her
pleasure
would
be
quite
spoilt
for
her
when
luncheon
was
over
the
had
coffee
in
the
study
while
we
younger
ones
ran
into
the
garden
and
went
chattering
along
the
undulating
paths
with
their
carpet
of
yellow
leaves
we
talked
about
woloda
s
riding
a
hunter
and
said
what
a
shame
it
was
that
lubotshka
could
not
run
as
fast
as
katenka
and
what
fun
it
would
be
if
we
could
see
grisha
s
chains
and
so
forth
but
of
the
impending
separation
we
said
not
a
word
our
chatter
was
interrupted
by
the
sound
of
the
carriage
driving
up
with
a
village
urchin
perched
on
each
of
its
springs
behind
the
carriage
rode
the
huntsmen
with
the
hounds
and
they
again
were
followed
by
the
groom
ignat
on
the
steed
intended
for
woloda
with
my
old
horse
trotting
alongside
after
running
to
the
garden
fence
to
get
a
sight
of
all
these
interesting
objects
and
indulging
in
a
chorus
of
whistling
and
hallooing
we
rushed
upstairs
to
dress
our
one
aim
being
to
make
ourselves
look
as
like
the
huntsmen
as
possible
the
obvious
way
to
do
this
was
to
tuck
one
s
breeches
inside
one
s
boots
we
lost
no
time
over
it
all
for
we
were
in
a
hurry
to
run
to
the
entrance
steps
again
there
to
feast
our
eyes
upon
the
horses
and
hounds
and
to
have
a
chat
with
the
huntsmen
the
day
was
exceedingly
warm
while
though
clouds
of
fantastic
shape
had
been
gathering
on
the
horizon
since
morning
and
driving
before
a
light
breeze
across
the
sun
it
was
clear
that
for
all
their
menacing
blackness
they
did
not
really
intend
to
form
a
thunderstorm
and
spoil
our
last
day
s
pleasure
moreover
towards
afternoon
some
of
them
broke
grew
pale
and
elongated
and
sank
to
the
horizon
again
while
others
of
them
changed
to
the
likeness
of
white
transparent
in
the
east
over
maslovska
a
single
lurid
mass
was
louring
but
karl
ivanitch
who
always
seemed
to
know
the
ways
of
the
heavens
said
that
the
weather
would
still
continue
to
be
fair
and
dry
in
spite
of
his
advanced
years
it
was
in
quite
a
sprightly
manner
that
foka
came
out
to
the
entrance
steps
to
give
the
order
drive
in
fact
as
he
planted
his
legs
firmly
apart
and
took
up
his
station
between
the
lowest
step
and
the
spot
where
the
coachman
was
to
halt
his
mien
was
that
of
a
man
who
knew
his
duties
and
had
no
need
to
be
reminded
of
them
by
anybody
presently
the
ladies
also
came
out
and
after
a
little
discussions
as
to
seats
and
the
safety
of
the
girls
all
of
which
seemed
to
me
wholly
superfluous
they
settled
themselves
in
the
vehicle
opened
their
parasols
and
started
as
the
carriage
was
driving
away
mamma
pointed
to
the
hunter
and
asked
nervously
is
that
the
horse
intended
for
vladimir
petrovitch
on
the
groom
answering
in
the
affirmative
she
raised
her
hands
in
horror
and
turned
her
head
away
as
for
myself
i
was
burning
with
impatience
clambering
on
to
the
back
of
my
steed
i
was
just
tall
enough
to
see
between
its
ears
i
proceeded
to
perform
evolutions
in
the
courtyard
mind
you
don
t
ride
over
the
hounds
sir
said
one
of
the
huntsmen
hold
your
tongue
it
is
not
the
first
time
i
have
been
one
of
the
i
retorted
with
dignity
although
woloda
had
plenty
of
pluck
he
was
not
altogether
free
from
apprehensions
as
he
sat
on
the
hunter
indeed
he
more
than
once
asked
as
he
patted
it
is
he
quiet
he
looked
very
well
on
horseback
almost
a
young
man
and
held
himself
so
upright
in
the
saddle
that
i
envied
him
since
my
shadow
seemed
to
show
that
i
could
not
compare
with
him
in
looks
presently
papa
s
footsteps
sounded
on
the
flagstones
the
whip
collected
the
hounds
and
the
huntsmen
mounted
their
steeds
papa
s
horse
came
up
in
charge
of
a
groom
the
hounds
of
his
particular
leash
sprang
up
from
their
picturesque
attitudes
to
fawn
upon
him
and
milka
in
a
collar
studded
with
beads
came
bounding
joyfully
from
behind
his
heels
to
greet
and
sport
with
the
other
dogs
finally
as
soon
as
papa
had
mounted
we
rode
away
vii
the
hunt
at
the
head
of
the
cavalcade
rode
turka
on
a
roan
on
his
head
he
wore
a
shaggy
cap
while
with
a
magnificent
horn
slung
across
his
shoulders
and
a
knife
at
his
belt
he
looked
so
cruel
and
inexorable
that
one
would
have
thought
he
was
going
to
engage
in
bloody
strife
with
his
fellow
men
rather
than
to
hunt
a
small
animal
around
the
hind
legs
of
his
horse
the
hounds
gambolled
like
a
cluster
of
checkered
restless
balls
if
one
of
them
wished
to
stop
it
was
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
it
could
do
so
since
not
only
had
its
also
to
be
induced
to
halt
but
at
once
one
of
the
huntsmen
would
wheel
round
crack
his
whip
and
shout
to
the
delinquent
back
to
the
pack
there
arrived
at
a
gate
papa
told
us
and
the
huntsmen
to
continue
our
way
along
the
road
and
then
rode
off
across
a
cornfield
the
harvest
was
at
its
height
on
the
further
side
of
a
large
shining
yellow
stretch
of
cornland
lay
a
high
purple
belt
of
forest
which
always
figured
in
my
eyes
as
a
distant
mysterious
region
behind
which
either
the
world
ended
or
an
uninhabited
waste
began
this
expanse
of
was
dotted
with
swathes
and
reapers
while
along
the
lanes
where
the
sickle
had
passed
could
be
seen
the
backs
of
women
as
they
stooped
among
the
tall
thick
grain
or
lifted
armfuls
of
corn
and
rested
them
against
the
shocks
in
one
corner
a
woman
was
bending
over
a
cradle
and
the
whole
stubble
was
studded
with
sheaves
and
cornflowers
in
another
direction
men
were
standing
on
waggons
shaking
the
soil
from
the
stalks
of
sheaves
and
stacking
them
for
carrying
as
soon
as
the
foreman
dressed
in
a
blouse
and
high
boots
and
carrying
a
caught
sight
of
papa
he
hastened
to
take
off
his
lamb
cap
and
wiping
his
red
head
told
the
women
to
get
up
papa
s
chestnut
horse
went
trotting
along
with
a
prancing
gait
as
it
tossed
its
head
and
swished
its
tail
to
and
fro
to
drive
away
the
gadflies
and
countless
other
insects
which
tormented
its
flanks
while
his
two
greyhounds
their
tails
curved
like
sickles
went
springing
gracefully
over
the
stubble
milka
was
always
first
but
every
now
and
then
she
would
halt
with
a
shake
of
her
head
to
await
the
the
chatter
of
the
peasants
the
rumbling
of
horses
and
waggons
the
joyous
cries
of
quails
the
hum
of
insects
as
they
hung
suspended
in
the
motionless
air
the
smell
of
the
soil
and
grain
and
steam
from
our
horses
the
thousand
different
lights
and
shadows
which
the
burning
sun
cast
upon
the
cornland
the
purple
forest
in
the
distance
the
white
gossamer
threads
which
were
floating
in
the
air
or
resting
on
the
these
things
i
observed
and
heard
and
felt
to
the
core
arrived
at
the
kalinovo
wood
we
found
the
carriage
awaiting
us
there
with
beside
it
a
waggonette
driven
by
the
butler
a
waggonette
in
which
were
a
some
apparatus
for
making
ices
and
many
other
attractive
boxes
and
bundles
all
packed
in
straw
there
was
no
mistaking
these
signs
for
they
meant
that
we
were
going
to
have
tea
fruit
and
ices
in
the
open
air
this
afforded
us
intense
delight
since
to
drink
tea
in
a
wood
and
on
the
grass
and
where
none
else
had
ever
drunk
tea
before
seemed
to
us
a
treat
beyond
expressing
when
turka
arrived
at
the
little
clearing
where
the
carriage
was
halted
he
took
papa
s
detailed
instructions
as
to
how
we
were
to
divide
ourselves
and
where
each
of
us
was
to
go
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
never
acted
according
to
such
instructions
but
always
followed
his
own
devices
then
he
unleashed
the
hounds
fastened
the
leashes
to
his
saddle
whistled
to
the
pack
and
disappeared
among
the
young
birch
trees
the
liberated
hounds
jumping
about
him
in
high
delight
wagging
their
tails
and
sniffing
and
gambolling
with
one
another
as
they
dispersed
themselves
in
different
directions
has
anyone
a
to
spare
asked
papa
i
took
mine
from
my
pocket
and
offered
it
to
him
very
well
fasten
it
to
this
greyhound
gizana
i
asked
with
the
air
of
a
connoisseur
yes
then
run
him
along
the
road
with
you
when
you
come
to
a
little
clearing
in
the
wood
stop
and
look
about
you
and
don
t
come
back
to
me
without
a
accordingly
i
tied
my
handkerchief
round
gizana
s
soft
neck
and
set
off
running
at
full
speed
towards
the
appointed
spot
papa
laughing
as
he
shouted
after
me
hurry
up
hurry
up
or
you
ll
be
late
every
now
and
then
gizana
kept
stopping
pricking
up
his
ears
and
listening
to
the
hallooing
of
the
beaters
whenever
he
did
this
i
was
not
strong
enough
to
move
him
and
could
do
no
more
than
shout
come
on
come
on
presently
he
set
off
so
fast
that
i
could
not
restrain
him
and
i
encountered
more
than
one
fall
before
we
reached
our
destination
selecting
there
a
level
shady
spot
near
the
roots
of
a
great
i
lay
down
on
the
turf
made
gizana
crouch
beside
me
and
waited
as
usual
my
imagination
far
outstripped
reality
i
fancied
that
i
was
pursuing
at
least
my
third
hare
when
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
first
hound
was
only
just
giving
tongue
presently
however
turka
s
voice
began
to
sound
through
the
wood
in
louder
and
more
excited
tones
the
baying
of
a
hound
came
nearer
and
nearer
and
then
another
and
then
a
third
and
then
a
fourth
deep
throat
joined
in
the
rising
and
falling
cadences
of
a
chorus
until
the
whole
had
united
their
voices
in
one
continuous
tumultuous
burst
of
melody
as
the
russian
proverb
expresses
it
the
forest
had
found
a
tongue
and
the
hounds
were
burning
as
with
my
excitement
was
so
great
that
i
nearly
swooned
where
i
stood
my
lips
parted
themselves
as
though
smiling
the
perspiration
poured
from
me
in
streams
and
in
spite
of
the
tickling
sensation
caused
by
the
drops
as
they
trickled
over
my
chin
i
never
thought
of
wiping
them
away
i
felt
that
a
crisis
was
approaching
yet
the
tension
was
too
unnatural
to
last
soon
the
hounds
came
tearing
along
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
then
behold
they
were
racing
away
from
me
again
and
of
hares
there
was
not
a
sign
to
be
seen
i
looked
in
every
direction
and
gizana
did
the
same
pulling
at
his
leash
at
first
and
whining
then
he
lay
down
again
by
my
side
rested
his
muzzle
on
my
knees
and
resigned
himself
to
disappointment
among
the
naked
roots
of
the
under
which
i
was
sitting
i
could
see
countless
ants
swarming
over
the
parched
grey
earth
and
winding
among
the
acorns
withered
dry
twigs
russet
moss
and
slender
scanty
blades
of
grass
in
serried
files
they
kept
pressing
forward
on
the
level
track
they
had
made
for
themselves
some
carrying
burdens
some
not
i
took
a
piece
of
twig
and
barred
their
way
instantly
it
was
curious
to
see
how
they
made
light
of
the
obstacle
some
got
past
it
by
creeping
underneath
and
some
by
climbing
over
it
a
few
however
there
were
especially
those
weighted
with
loads
who
were
nonplussed
what
to
do
they
either
halted
and
searched
for
a
way
round
or
returned
whence
they
had
come
or
climbed
the
adjacent
herbage
with
the
evident
intention
of
reaching
my
hand
and
going
up
the
sleeve
of
my
jacket
from
this
interesting
spectacle
my
attention
was
distracted
by
the
yellow
wings
of
a
butterfly
which
was
fluttering
alluringly
before
me
yet
i
had
scarcely
noticed
it
before
it
flew
away
to
a
little
distance
and
circling
over
some
blossoms
of
white
clover
settled
on
one
of
them
whether
it
was
the
sun
s
warmth
that
delighted
it
or
whether
it
was
busy
sucking
nectar
from
the
flower
at
all
events
it
seemed
thoroughly
comfortable
it
scarcely
moved
its
wings
at
all
and
pressed
itself
down
into
the
clover
until
i
could
hardly
see
its
body
i
sat
with
my
chin
on
my
hands
and
watched
it
with
intense
interest
suddenly
gizana
sprang
up
and
gave
me
such
a
violent
jerk
that
i
nearly
rolled
over
i
looked
round
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
a
hare
had
just
come
into
view
with
one
ear
bent
down
and
the
other
one
sharply
pricked
the
blood
rushed
to
my
head
and
i
forgot
everything
else
as
i
shouted
slipped
the
dog
and
rushed
towards
the
spot
yet
all
was
in
vain
the
hare
stopped
made
a
rush
and
was
lost
to
view
how
confused
i
felt
when
at
that
moment
turka
stepped
from
the
undergrowth
he
had
been
following
the
hounds
as
they
ran
along
the
edges
of
the
wood
he
had
seen
my
mistake
which
had
consisted
in
my
not
biding
my
time
and
now
threw
me
a
contemptuous
look
as
he
said
ah
master
and
you
should
have
heard
the
tone
in
which
he
said
it
it
would
have
been
a
relief
to
me
if
he
had
then
and
there
suspended
me
to
his
saddle
instead
of
the
hare
for
a
while
i
could
only
stand
miserably
where
i
was
without
attempting
to
recall
the
dog
and
ejaculate
as
i
slapped
my
knees
good
heavens
what
a
fool
i
was
i
could
hear
the
hounds
retreating
into
the
distance
and
baying
along
the
further
side
of
the
wood
as
they
pursued
the
hare
while
turka
rallied
them
with
blasts
on
his
gorgeous
horn
yet
i
did
not
stir
viii
we
play
games
the
hunt
was
over
a
cloth
had
been
spread
in
the
shade
of
some
young
and
the
whole
party
was
disposed
around
it
the
butler
gabriel
had
stamped
down
the
surrounding
grass
wiped
the
plates
in
readiness
and
unpacked
from
a
basket
a
quantity
of
plums
and
peaches
wrapped
in
leaves
through
the
green
branches
of
the
young
the
sun
glittered
and
threw
little
glancing
balls
of
light
upon
the
pattern
of
my
napkin
my
legs
and
the
bald
moist
head
of
gabriel
a
soft
breeze
played
in
the
leaves
of
the
trees
above
us
and
breathing
softly
upon
my
hair
and
heated
face
refreshed
me
beyond
measure
when
we
had
finished
the
fruit
and
ices
nothing
remained
to
be
done
around
the
empty
cloth
so
despite
the
oblique
scorching
rays
of
the
sun
we
rose
and
proceeded
to
play
well
what
shall
it
be
said
lubotshka
blinking
in
the
sunlight
and
skipping
about
the
grass
suppose
we
play
robinson
no
that
s
a
tiresome
game
objected
woloda
stretching
himself
lazily
on
the
turf
and
gnawing
some
leaves
always
robinson
if
you
want
to
play
at
something
play
at
building
a
woloda
was
giving
himself
tremendous
airs
probably
he
was
proud
of
having
ridden
the
hunter
and
so
pretended
to
be
very
tired
perhaps
also
he
had
too
much
and
too
little
imagination
fully
to
enjoy
the
game
of
robinson
it
was
a
game
which
consisted
of
performing
various
scenes
from
the
swiss
family
robinson
a
book
which
we
had
recently
been
reading
well
but
be
a
good
boy
why
not
try
and
please
us
this
time
the
girls
answered
you
may
be
charles
or
ernest
or
the
father
whichever
you
like
best
added
katenka
as
she
tried
to
raise
him
from
the
ground
by
pulling
at
his
sleeve
no
i
m
not
going
to
it
s
a
tiresome
game
said
woloda
again
though
smiling
as
if
secretly
pleased
it
would
be
better
to
sit
at
home
than
not
to
play
at
anything
murmured
lubotshka
with
tears
in
her
eyes
she
was
a
great
weeper
well
go
on
then
only
don
t
cry
i
can
t
stand
that
sort
of
woloda
s
condescension
did
not
please
us
much
on
the
contrary
his
lazy
tired
expression
took
away
all
the
fun
of
the
game
when
we
sat
on
the
ground
and
imagined
that
we
were
sitting
in
a
boat
and
either
fishing
or
rowing
with
all
our
might
woloda
persisted
in
sitting
with
folded
hands
or
in
anything
but
a
fisherman
s
posture
i
made
a
remark
about
it
but
he
replied
that
whether
we
moved
our
hands
or
not
we
should
neither
gain
nor
lose
ground
certainly
not
advance
at
all
and
i
was
forced
to
agree
with
him
again
when
i
pretended
to
go
out
hunting
and
with
a
stick
over
my
shoulder
set
off
into
the
wood
woloda
only
lay
down
on
his
back
with
his
hands
under
his
head
and
said
that
he
supposed
it
was
all
the
same
whether
he
went
or
not
such
behaviour
and
speeches
cooled
our
ardour
for
the
game
and
were
very
disagreeable
the
more
so
since
it
was
impossible
not
to
confess
to
oneself
that
woloda
was
right
i
myself
knew
that
it
was
not
only
impossible
to
kill
birds
with
a
stick
but
to
shoot
at
all
with
such
a
weapon
still
it
was
the
game
and
if
we
were
once
to
begin
reasoning
thus
it
would
become
equally
impossible
for
us
to
go
for
drives
on
chairs
i
think
that
even
woloda
himself
can
not
at
that
moment
have
forgotten
how
in
the
long
winter
evenings
we
had
been
used
to
cover
an
with
a
shawl
and
make
a
carriage
of
it
one
of
us
being
the
coachman
another
one
the
footman
the
two
girls
the
passengers
and
three
other
chairs
the
trio
of
horses
abreast
with
what
ceremony
we
used
to
set
out
and
with
what
adventures
we
used
to
meet
on
the
way
how
gaily
and
quickly
those
long
winter
evenings
used
to
pass
if
we
were
always
to
judge
from
reality
games
would
be
nonsense
but
if
games
were
nonsense
what
else
would
there
be
left
to
do
ix
a
first
essay
in
love
pretending
to
gather
some
american
fruit
from
a
tree
lubotshka
suddenly
plucked
a
leaf
upon
which
was
a
huge
caterpillar
and
throwing
the
insect
with
horror
to
the
ground
lifted
her
hands
and
sprang
away
as
though
afraid
it
would
spit
at
her
the
game
stopped
and
we
crowded
our
heads
together
as
we
stooped
to
look
at
the
curiosity
i
peeped
over
katenka
s
shoulder
as
she
was
trying
to
lift
the
caterpillar
by
placing
another
leaf
in
its
way
i
had
observed
before
that
the
girls
had
a
way
of
shrugging
their
shoulders
whenever
they
were
trying
to
put
a
loose
garment
straight
on
their
bare
necks
as
well
as
that
mimi
always
grew
angry
on
witnessing
this
manoeuvre
and
declared
it
to
be
a
chambermaid
s
trick
as
katenka
bent
over
the
caterpillar
she
made
that
very
movement
while
at
the
same
instant
the
breeze
lifted
the
fichu
on
her
white
neck
her
shoulder
was
close
to
my
lips
i
looked
at
it
and
kissed
it
she
did
not
turn
round
but
woloda
remarked
without
raising
his
head
what
spooniness
i
felt
the
tears
rising
to
my
eyes
and
could
not
take
my
gaze
from
katenka
i
had
long
been
used
to
her
fair
fresh
face
and
had
always
been
fond
of
her
but
now
i
looked
at
her
more
closely
and
felt
more
fond
of
her
than
i
had
ever
done
or
felt
before
when
we
returned
to
the
papa
informed
us
to
our
great
joy
that
at
mamma
s
entreaties
our
departure
was
to
be
postponed
until
the
following
morning
we
rode
home
beside
the
carriage
woloda
and
i
galloping
near
it
and
vieing
with
one
another
in
our
exhibition
of
horsemanship
and
daring
my
shadow
looked
longer
now
than
it
had
done
before
and
from
that
i
judged
that
i
had
grown
into
a
fine
rider
yet
my
complacency
was
soon
marred
by
an
unfortunate
occurrence
desiring
to
outdo
woloda
before
the
audience
in
the
carriage
i
dropped
a
little
behind
then
with
whip
and
spur
i
urged
my
steed
forward
and
at
the
same
time
assumed
a
natural
graceful
attitude
with
the
intention
of
whooting
past
the
carriage
on
the
side
on
which
katenka
was
seated
my
only
doubt
was
whether
to
halloo
or
not
as
i
did
so
in
the
event
my
infernal
horse
stopped
so
abruptly
when
just
level
with
the
carriage
horses
that
i
was
pitched
forward
on
to
its
neck
and
cut
a
very
sorry
figure
x
the
sort
of
man
my
father
was
papa
was
a
gentleman
of
the
last
century
with
all
the
chivalrous
character
and
gallantry
of
the
youth
of
that
time
upon
the
men
of
the
present
day
he
looked
with
a
contempt
arising
partly
from
inborn
pride
and
partly
from
a
secret
feeling
of
vexation
that
in
this
age
of
ours
he
could
no
longer
enjoy
the
influence
and
success
which
had
been
his
in
his
youth
his
two
principal
failings
were
gambling
and
gallantry
and
he
had
won
or
lost
in
the
course
of
his
career
several
millions
of
roubles
tall
and
of
imposing
figure
he
walked
with
a
curiously
quick
mincing
gait
as
well
as
had
a
habit
of
hitching
one
of
his
shoulders
his
eyes
were
small
and
perpetually
twinkling
his
nose
large
and
aquiline
his
lips
irregular
and
rather
oddly
though
pleasantly
compressed
his
articulation
slightly
defective
and
lisping
and
his
head
quite
bald
such
was
my
father
s
exterior
from
the
days
of
my
earliest
recollection
it
was
an
exterior
which
not
only
brought
him
success
and
made
him
a
man
a
bonnes
fortunes
but
one
which
pleased
people
of
all
ranks
and
stations
especially
did
it
please
those
whom
he
desired
to
please
at
all
junctures
he
knew
how
to
take
the
lead
for
though
not
deriving
from
the
highest
circles
of
society
he
had
always
mixed
with
them
and
knew
how
to
win
their
respect
he
possessed
in
the
highest
degree
that
measure
of
pride
and
which
without
giving
offence
maintains
a
man
in
the
opinion
of
the
world
he
had
much
originality
as
well
as
the
ability
to
use
it
in
such
a
way
that
it
benefited
him
as
much
as
actual
worldly
position
or
fortune
could
have
done
nothing
in
the
universe
could
surprise
him
and
though
not
of
eminent
attainments
in
life
he
seemed
born
to
have
acquired
them
he
understood
so
perfectly
how
to
make
both
himself
and
others
forget
and
keep
at
a
distance
the
seamy
side
of
life
with
all
its
petty
troubles
and
vicissitudes
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
envy
him
he
was
a
connoisseur
in
everything
which
could
give
ease
and
pleasure
as
well
as
knew
how
to
make
use
of
such
knowledge
likewise
he
prided
himself
on
the
brilliant
connections
which
he
had
formed
through
my
mother
s
family
or
through
friends
of
his
youth
and
was
secretly
jealous
of
any
one
of
a
higher
rank
than
himself
any
one
that
is
to
say
of
a
rank
higher
than
a
retired
lieutenant
of
the
guards
moreover
like
all
he
refused
to
dress
himself
in
the
prevailing
fashion
though
he
attired
himself
both
originally
and
artistically
his
invariable
wear
being
light
suits
very
fine
shirts
and
large
collars
and
cuffs
everything
seemed
to
suit
his
upright
figure
and
quiet
assured
air
he
was
sensitive
to
the
pitch
of
sentimentality
and
when
reading
a
pathetic
passage
his
voice
would
begin
to
tremble
and
the
tears
to
come
into
his
eyes
until
he
had
to
lay
the
book
aside
likewise
he
was
fond
of
music
and
could
accompany
himself
on
the
piano
as
he
sang
the
love
songs
of
his
friend
a
or
gipsy
songs
or
themes
from
operas
but
he
had
no
love
for
serious
music
and
would
frankly
flout
received
opinion
by
declaring
that
whereas
beethoven
s
sonatas
wearied
him
and
sent
him
to
sleep
his
ideal
of
beauty
was
do
not
wake
me
youth
as
semenoff
sang
it
or
not
one
as
the
gipsy
taninsha
rendered
that
ditty
his
nature
was
essentially
one
of
those
which
follow
public
opinion
concerning
what
is
good
and
consider
only
that
good
which
the
public
declares
to
be
so
it
may
be
noted
that
the
author
has
said
earlier
in
the
chapter
that
his
father
possessed
much
god
only
knows
whether
he
had
any
moral
convictions
his
life
was
so
full
of
amusement
that
probably
he
never
had
time
to
form
any
and
was
too
successful
ever
to
feel
the
lack
of
them
as
he
grew
to
old
age
he
looked
at
things
always
from
a
fixed
point
of
view
and
cultivated
fixed
rules
but
only
so
long
as
that
point
or
those
rules
coincided
with
expediency
the
mode
of
life
which
offered
some
passing
degree
of
interest
that
in
his
opinion
was
the
right
one
and
the
only
one
that
men
ought
to
affect
he
had
great
fluency
of
argument
and
this
i
think
increased
the
adaptability
of
his
morals
and
enabled
him
to
speak
of
one
and
the
same
act
now
as
good
and
now
with
abuse
as
abominable
xi
in
the
and
the
study
twilight
had
set
in
when
we
reached
home
mamma
sat
down
to
the
piano
and
we
to
a
table
there
to
paint
and
draw
in
colours
and
pencil
though
i
had
only
one
cake
of
colour
and
it
was
blue
i
determined
to
draw
a
picture
of
the
hunt
in
exceedingly
vivid
fashion
i
painted
a
blue
boy
on
a
blue
horse
and
but
here
i
stopped
for
i
was
uncertain
whether
it
was
possible
also
to
paint
a
blue
hare
i
ran
to
the
study
to
consult
papa
and
as
he
was
busy
reading
he
never
lifted
his
eyes
from
his
book
when
i
asked
can
there
be
blue
hares
but
at
once
replied
there
can
my
boy
there
returning
to
the
table
i
painted
in
my
blue
hare
but
subsequently
thought
it
better
to
change
it
into
a
blue
bush
yet
the
blue
bush
did
not
wholly
please
me
so
i
changed
it
into
a
tree
and
then
into
a
rick
until
the
whole
paper
having
now
become
one
blur
of
blue
i
tore
it
angrily
in
pieces
and
went
off
to
meditate
in
the
large
mamma
was
playing
field
s
second
concerto
field
it
may
be
said
had
been
her
master
as
i
dozed
the
music
brought
up
before
my
imagination
a
kind
of
luminosity
with
transparent
next
she
played
the
sonate
pathetique
of
beethoven
and
i
at
once
felt
heavy
depressed
and
apprehensive
mamma
often
played
those
two
pieces
and
therefore
i
well
recollect
the
feelings
they
awakened
in
me
those
feelings
were
a
reminiscence
of
what
somehow
i
seemed
to
remember
something
which
had
never
been
opposite
to
me
lay
the
study
door
and
presently
i
saw
jakoff
enter
it
accompanied
by
several
men
in
kaftans
then
the
door
shut
again
now
they
are
going
to
begin
some
business
or
other
i
thought
i
believed
the
affairs
transacted
in
that
study
to
be
the
most
important
ones
on
earth
this
opinion
was
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
people
only
approached
the
door
of
that
room
on
tiptoe
and
speaking
in
whispers
presently
papa
s
resonant
voice
sounded
within
and
i
also
scented
cigar
smoke
always
a
very
attractive
thing
to
me
next
as
i
dozed
i
suddenly
heard
a
creaking
of
boots
that
i
knew
and
sure
enough
saw
karl
ivanitch
go
on
tiptoe
and
with
a
depressed
but
resolute
expression
on
his
face
and
a
written
document
in
his
hand
to
the
study
door
and
knock
softly
it
opened
and
then
shut
again
behind
him
i
hope
nothing
is
going
to
happen
i
mused
karl
ivanitch
is
offended
and
might
be
capable
of
anything
and
again
i
dozed
off
nevertheless
something
did
happen
an
hour
later
i
was
disturbed
by
the
same
creaking
of
boots
and
saw
karl
come
out
and
disappear
up
the
stairs
wiping
away
a
few
tears
from
his
cheeks
with
his
pocket
handkerchief
as
he
went
and
muttering
something
between
his
teeth
papa
came
out
behind
him
and
turned
aside
into
the
do
you
know
what
i
have
just
decided
to
do
he
asked
gaily
as
he
laid
a
hand
upon
mamma
s
shoulder
what
my
love
to
take
karl
ivanitch
with
the
children
there
will
be
room
enough
for
him
in
the
carriage
they
are
used
to
him
and
he
seems
greatly
attached
to
them
seven
hundred
roubles
a
year
can
not
make
much
difference
to
us
and
the
poor
devil
is
not
at
all
a
bad
sort
of
a
i
could
not
understand
why
papa
should
speak
of
him
so
disrespectfully
i
am
delighted
said
mamma
and
as
much
for
the
children
s
sake
as
his
own
he
is
a
worthy
old
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
how
moved
he
was
when
i
told
him
that
he
might
look
upon
the
roubles
as
a
present
but
the
most
amusing
thing
of
all
is
this
bill
which
he
has
just
handed
me
it
is
worth
seeing
and
with
a
smile
papa
gave
mamma
a
paper
inscribed
in
karl
s
handwriting
is
it
not
capital
he
concluded
the
contents
of
the
paper
were
as
follows
the
joke
of
this
bill
consists
chiefly
in
its
being
written
in
very
bad
russian
with
continual
mistakes
as
to
plural
and
singular
prepositions
and
so
forth
two
book
for
the
children
copeck
coloured
paper
gold
frames
and
a
blockheads
this
word
has
a
double
meaning
in
russian
for
cutting
out
several
box
for
presents
roubles
copecks
several
book
and
a
bows
presents
for
the
childrens
roubles
copecks
a
gold
watches
promised
to
me
by
peter
alexandrovitch
out
of
moscow
in
the
years
for
roubles
consequently
karl
mayer
have
to
receive
rouble
copecks
beside
his
if
people
were
to
judge
only
by
this
bill
in
which
karl
ivanitch
demanded
repayment
of
all
the
money
he
had
spent
on
presents
as
well
as
the
value
of
a
present
promised
to
himself
they
would
take
him
to
have
been
a
callous
avaricious
egotist
yet
they
would
be
wrong
it
appears
that
he
had
entered
the
study
with
the
paper
in
his
hand
and
a
set
speech
in
his
head
for
the
purpose
of
declaiming
eloquently
to
papa
on
the
subject
of
the
wrongs
which
he
believed
himself
to
have
suffered
in
our
house
but
that
as
soon
as
ever
he
began
to
speak
in
the
vibratory
voice
and
with
the
expressive
intonations
which
he
used
in
dictating
to
us
his
eloquence
wrought
upon
himself
more
than
upon
papa
with
the
result
that
when
he
came
to
the
point
where
he
had
to
say
however
sad
it
will
be
for
me
to
part
with
the
children
he
lost
his
utterly
his
articulation
became
choked
and
he
was
obliged
to
draw
his
coloured
from
his
pocket
yes
peter
alexandrovitch
he
said
weeping
this
formed
no
part
of
the
prepared
speech
i
am
grown
so
used
to
the
children
that
i
can
not
think
what
i
should
do
without
them
i
would
rather
serve
you
without
salary
than
not
at
all
and
with
one
hand
he
wiped
his
eyes
while
with
the
other
he
presented
the
bill
although
i
am
convinced
that
at
that
moment
karl
ivanitch
was
speaking
with
absolute
sincerity
for
i
know
how
good
his
heart
was
i
confess
that
never
to
this
day
have
i
been
able
quite
to
reconcile
his
words
with
the
bill
well
if
the
idea
of
leaving
us
grieves
you
you
may
be
sure
that
the
idea
of
dismissing
you
grieves
me
equally
said
papa
tapping
him
on
the
shoulder
then
after
a
pause
he
added
but
i
have
changed
my
mind
and
you
shall
not
leave
just
before
supper
grisha
entered
the
room
ever
since
he
had
entered
the
house
that
day
he
had
never
ceased
to
sigh
and
weep
a
portent
according
to
those
who
believed
in
his
prophetic
powers
that
misfortune
was
impending
for
the
household
he
had
now
come
to
take
leave
of
us
for
so
he
said
he
must
be
moving
on
i
nudged
woloda
and
we
moved
towards
the
door
what
is
the
matter
he
said
this
that
if
we
want
to
see
grisha
s
chains
we
must
go
upstairs
at
once
to
the
rooms
grisha
is
to
sleep
in
the
second
one
so
we
can
sit
in
the
and
see
all
right
wait
here
and
i
ll
tell
the
the
girls
came
at
once
and
we
ascended
the
stairs
though
the
question
as
to
which
of
us
should
first
enter
the
gave
us
some
little
trouble
then
we
cowered
down
and
waited
xii
grisha
we
all
felt
a
little
uneasy
in
the
thick
darkness
so
we
pressed
close
to
one
another
and
said
nothing
before
long
grisha
arrived
with
his
soft
tread
carrying
in
one
hand
his
staff
and
in
the
other
a
tallow
candle
set
in
a
brass
candlestick
we
scarcely
ventured
to
breathe
our
lord
jesus
christ
holy
mother
of
god
father
son
and
holy
ghost
he
kept
repeating
with
the
different
intonations
and
abbreviations
which
gradually
become
peculiar
to
persons
who
are
accustomed
to
pronounce
the
words
with
great
frequency
still
praying
he
placed
his
staff
in
a
corner
and
looked
at
the
bed
after
which
he
began
to
undress
unfastening
his
old
black
girdle
he
slowly
divested
himself
of
his
torn
nankeen
kaftan
and
deposited
it
carefully
on
the
back
of
a
chair
his
face
had
now
lost
its
usual
disquietude
and
idiocy
on
the
contrary
it
had
in
it
something
restful
thoughtful
and
even
grand
while
all
his
movements
were
deliberate
and
intelligent
next
he
lay
down
quietly
in
his
shirt
on
the
bed
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
towards
every
side
of
him
and
adjusted
his
chains
beneath
his
shirt
an
operation
which
as
we
could
see
from
his
face
occasioned
him
considerable
pain
then
he
sat
up
again
looked
gravely
at
his
ragged
shirt
and
rising
and
taking
the
candle
lifted
the
latter
towards
the
shrine
where
the
images
of
the
saints
stood
that
done
he
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
again
and
turned
the
candle
upside
down
when
it
went
out
with
a
hissing
noise
through
the
window
which
overlooked
the
wood
the
moon
nearly
full
was
shining
in
such
a
way
that
one
side
of
the
tall
white
figure
of
the
idiot
stood
out
in
the
pale
silvery
moonlight
while
the
other
side
was
lost
in
the
dark
shadow
which
covered
the
floor
walls
and
ceiling
in
the
courtyard
the
watchman
was
tapping
at
intervals
upon
his
brass
alarm
plate
for
a
while
grisha
stood
silently
before
the
images
and
with
his
large
hands
pressed
to
his
breast
and
his
head
bent
forward
gave
occasional
sighs
then
with
difficulty
he
knelt
down
and
began
to
pray
at
first
he
repeated
some
prayers
and
only
accented
a
word
here
and
there
next
he
repeated
thee
same
prayers
but
louder
and
with
increased
accentuation
lastly
he
repeated
them
again
and
with
even
greater
emphasis
as
well
as
with
an
evident
effort
to
pronounce
them
in
the
old
slavonic
church
dialect
though
disconnected
his
prayers
were
very
touching
he
prayed
for
all
his
benefactors
so
he
called
every
one
who
had
received
him
hospitably
with
among
them
mamma
and
ourselves
next
he
prayed
for
himself
and
besought
god
to
forgive
him
his
sins
at
the
same
time
repeating
god
forgive
also
my
enemies
then
moaning
with
the
effort
he
rose
from
his
knees
only
to
fall
to
the
floor
again
and
repeat
his
phrases
afresh
at
last
he
regained
his
feet
despite
the
weight
of
the
chains
which
rattled
loudly
whenever
they
struck
the
floor
woloda
pinched
me
rudely
in
the
leg
but
i
took
no
notice
of
that
except
that
i
involuntarily
touched
the
place
with
my
hand
as
i
observed
with
a
feeling
of
childish
astonishment
pity
and
respect
the
words
and
gestures
of
grisha
instead
of
the
laughter
and
amusement
which
i
had
expected
on
entering
the
i
felt
my
heart
beating
and
overcome
grisha
continued
for
some
time
in
this
state
of
religious
ecstasy
as
he
improvised
prayers
and
repeated
again
and
yet
again
lord
have
mercy
upon
me
each
time
that
he
said
pardon
me
lord
and
teach
me
to
do
what
thou
wouldst
have
done
he
pronounced
the
words
with
added
earnestness
and
emphasis
as
though
he
expected
an
immediate
answer
to
his
petition
and
then
fell
to
sobbing
and
moaning
once
more
finally
he
went
down
on
his
knees
again
folded
his
arms
upon
his
breast
and
remained
silent
i
ventured
to
put
my
head
round
the
door
holding
my
breath
as
i
did
so
but
grisha
still
made
no
movement
except
for
the
heavy
sighs
which
heaved
his
breast
in
the
moonlight
i
could
see
a
tear
glistening
on
the
white
patch
of
his
blind
eye
yes
thy
will
be
done
he
exclaimed
suddenly
with
an
expression
which
i
can
not
describe
as
prostrating
himself
with
his
forehead
on
the
floor
he
fell
to
sobbing
like
a
child
much
sand
has
run
out
since
then
many
recollections
of
the
past
have
faded
from
my
memory
or
become
blurred
in
indistinct
visions
and
poor
grisha
himself
has
long
since
reached
the
end
of
his
pilgrimage
but
the
impression
which
he
produced
upon
me
and
the
feelings
which
he
aroused
in
my
breast
will
never
leave
my
mind
o
truly
christian
grisha
your
faith
was
so
strong
that
you
could
feel
the
actual
presence
of
god
your
love
so
great
that
the
words
fell
of
themselves
from
your
lips
you
had
no
reason
to
prove
them
for
you
did
so
with
your
earnest
praises
of
his
majesty
as
you
fell
to
the
ground
speechless
and
in
tears
nevertheless
the
sense
of
awe
with
which
i
had
listened
to
grisha
could
not
last
for
ever
i
had
now
satisfied
my
curiosity
and
being
cramped
with
sitting
in
one
position
so
long
desired
to
join
in
the
tittering
and
fun
which
i
could
hear
going
on
in
the
dark
behind
me
some
one
took
my
hand
and
whispered
whose
hand
is
this
despite
the
darkness
i
knew
by
the
touch
and
the
low
voice
in
my
ear
that
it
was
katenka
i
took
her
by
the
arm
but
she
withdrew
it
and
in
doing
so
pushed
a
cane
chair
which
was
standing
near
grisha
lifted
his
head
looked
quietly
about
him
and
muttering
a
prayer
rose
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
towards
each
of
the
four
corners
of
the
room
xiii
natalia
savishna
in
days
gone
by
there
used
to
run
about
the
seignorial
courtyard
of
the
at
chabarovska
a
girl
called
natashka
she
always
wore
a
cotton
dress
went
barefooted
and
was
rosy
plump
and
gay
it
was
at
the
request
and
entreaties
of
her
father
the
clarionet
player
savi
that
my
grandfather
had
taken
her
upstairs
that
is
to
say
made
her
one
of
his
wife
s
female
servants
as
natashka
so
distinguished
herself
by
her
zeal
and
amiable
temper
that
when
mamma
arrived
as
a
baby
and
required
a
nurse
natashka
was
honoured
with
the
charge
of
her
in
this
new
office
the
girl
earned
still
further
praises
and
rewards
for
her
activity
trustworthiness
and
devotion
to
her
young
mistress
soon
however
the
powdered
head
and
buckled
shoes
of
the
young
and
active
footman
foka
who
had
frequent
opportunities
of
courting
her
since
they
were
in
the
same
service
captivated
her
unsophisticated
but
loving
heart
at
last
she
ventured
to
go
and
ask
my
grandfather
if
she
might
marry
foka
but
her
master
took
the
request
in
bad
part
flew
into
a
passion
and
punished
poor
natashka
by
exiling
her
to
a
farm
which
he
owned
in
a
remote
quarter
of
the
steppes
at
length
when
she
had
been
gone
six
months
and
nobody
could
be
found
to
replace
her
she
was
recalled
to
her
former
duties
returned
and
with
her
dress
in
rags
she
fell
at
grandpapa
s
feet
and
besought
him
to
restore
her
his
favour
and
kindness
and
to
forget
the
folly
of
which
she
had
been
guilty
folly
which
she
assured
him
should
never
recur
again
and
she
kept
her
word
from
that
time
forth
she
called
herself
not
natashka
but
natalia
savishna
and
took
to
wearing
a
cap
all
the
love
in
her
heart
was
now
bestowed
upon
her
young
charge
when
mamma
had
a
governess
appointed
for
her
education
natalia
was
awarded
the
keys
as
housekeeper
and
henceforth
had
the
linen
and
provisions
under
her
care
these
new
duties
she
fulfilled
with
equal
fidelity
and
zeal
she
lived
only
for
her
master
s
advantage
everything
in
which
she
could
detect
fraud
extravagance
or
waste
she
endeavoured
to
remedy
to
the
best
of
her
power
when
mamma
married
and
wished
in
some
way
to
reward
natalia
savishna
for
her
twenty
years
of
care
and
labour
she
sent
for
her
and
voicing
in
the
tenderest
terms
her
attachment
and
love
presented
her
with
a
stamped
charter
of
her
natalia
s
freedom
it
will
be
remembered
that
this
was
in
the
days
of
serfdom
telling
her
at
the
same
time
that
whether
she
continued
to
serve
in
the
household
or
not
she
should
always
receive
an
annual
pension
of
roubles
natalia
listened
in
silence
to
this
then
taking
the
document
in
her
hands
and
regarding
it
with
a
frown
she
muttered
something
between
her
teeth
and
darted
from
the
room
slamming
the
door
behind
her
not
understanding
the
reason
for
such
strange
conduct
mamma
followed
her
presently
to
her
room
and
found
her
sitting
with
streaming
eyes
on
her
trunk
crushing
her
between
her
fingers
and
looking
mournfully
at
the
remains
of
the
document
which
was
lying
torn
to
pieces
on
the
floor
what
is
the
matter
dear
natalia
savishna
said
mamma
taking
her
hand
nothing
ma
am
she
replied
only
only
i
must
have
displeased
you
somehow
since
you
wish
to
dismiss
me
from
the
house
well
i
will
she
withdrew
her
hand
and
with
difficulty
restraining
her
tears
rose
to
leave
the
room
but
mamma
stopped
her
and
they
wept
a
while
in
one
another
s
arms
ever
since
i
can
remember
anything
i
can
remember
natalia
savishna
and
her
love
and
tenderness
yet
only
now
have
i
learnt
to
appreciate
them
at
their
full
value
in
early
days
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
think
what
a
rare
and
wonderful
being
this
old
domestic
was
not
only
did
she
never
talk
but
she
seemed
never
even
to
think
of
herself
her
whole
life
was
compounded
of
love
and
yet
so
used
was
i
to
her
affection
and
singleness
of
heart
that
i
could
not
picture
things
otherwise
i
never
thought
of
thanking
her
or
of
asking
myself
is
she
also
happy
is
she
also
contented
often
on
some
pretext
or
another
i
would
leave
my
lessons
and
run
to
her
room
where
sitting
down
i
would
begin
to
muse
aloud
as
though
she
were
not
there
she
was
forever
mending
something
or
tidying
the
shelves
which
lined
her
room
or
marking
linen
so
that
she
took
no
heed
of
the
nonsense
which
i
talked
how
that
i
meant
to
become
a
general
to
marry
a
beautiful
woman
to
buy
a
chestnut
horse
to
build
myself
a
house
of
glass
to
invite
karl
ivanitch
s
relatives
to
come
and
visit
me
from
saxony
and
so
forth
to
all
of
which
she
would
only
reply
yes
my
love
then
on
my
rising
and
preparing
to
go
she
would
open
a
blue
trunk
which
had
pasted
on
the
inside
of
its
lid
a
coloured
picture
of
a
hussar
which
had
once
adorned
a
pomade
bottle
and
a
sketch
made
by
woloda
and
take
from
it
a
fumigation
pastille
which
she
would
light
and
shake
for
my
benefit
saying
these
dear
are
the
pastilles
which
your
grandfather
now
in
heaven
brought
back
from
otchakov
after
fighting
against
the
then
she
would
add
with
a
sigh
but
this
is
nearly
the
last
the
trunks
which
filled
her
room
seemed
to
contain
almost
everything
in
the
world
whenever
anything
was
wanted
people
said
oh
go
and
ask
natalia
savishna
for
it
and
sure
enough
it
was
seldom
that
she
did
not
produce
the
object
required
and
say
see
what
comes
of
taking
care
of
everything
her
trunks
contained
thousands
of
things
which
nobody
in
the
house
but
herself
would
have
thought
of
preserving
once
i
lost
my
temper
with
her
this
was
how
it
happened
one
day
after
luncheon
i
poured
myself
out
a
glass
of
kvass
and
then
dropped
the
decanter
and
so
stained
the
tablecloth
go
and
call
natalia
that
she
may
come
and
see
what
her
darling
has
done
said
mamma
natalia
arrived
and
shook
her
head
at
me
when
she
saw
the
damage
i
had
done
but
mamma
whispered
something
in
her
car
threw
a
look
at
myself
and
then
left
the
room
i
was
just
skipping
away
in
the
sprightliest
mood
possible
when
natalia
darted
out
upon
me
from
behind
the
door
with
the
tablecloth
in
her
hand
and
catching
hold
of
me
rubbed
my
face
hard
with
the
stained
part
of
it
repeating
don
t
thou
go
and
spoil
tablecloths
any
more
i
struggled
hard
and
roared
with
temper
what
i
said
to
myself
as
i
fled
to
the
in
a
mist
of
tears
to
think
that
natalia
plain
say
thou
to
me
and
rub
my
face
with
a
wet
tablecloth
as
though
i
were
a
mere
it
is
abominable
seeing
my
fury
natalia
departed
while
i
continued
to
strut
about
and
plan
how
to
punish
the
bold
woman
for
her
offence
yet
not
more
than
a
few
moments
had
passed
when
natalia
returned
and
stealing
to
my
side
began
to
comfort
me
hush
then
my
love
do
not
cry
forgive
me
my
rudeness
it
was
wrong
of
me
you
will
pardon
me
my
darling
will
you
not
there
there
that
s
a
dear
and
she
took
from
her
handkerchief
a
cornet
of
pink
paper
containing
two
little
cakes
and
a
grape
and
offered
it
me
with
a
trembling
hand
i
could
not
look
the
kind
old
woman
in
the
face
but
turning
aside
took
the
paper
while
my
tears
flowed
the
faster
though
from
love
and
shame
now
not
from
anger
xiv
the
parting
on
the
day
after
the
events
described

up
to
the
door
at
noon
nicola
dressed
for
the
journey
with
his
breeches
tucked
into
his
boots
and
an
old
overcoat
belted
tightly
about
him
with
a
girdle
got
into
the
cart
and
arranged
cloaks
and
cushions
on
the
seats
when
he
thought
that
they
were
piled
high
enough
he
sat
down
on
them
but
finding
them
still
unsatisfactory
jumped
up
and
arranged
them
once
more
nicola
dimitvitch
would
you
be
so
good
as
to
take
master
s
with
you
said
papa
s
valet
suddenly
standing
up
in
the
carriage
it
won
t
take
up
much
you
should
have
told
me
before
michael
ivanitch
answered
nicola
snappishly
as
he
hurled
a
bundle
with
all
his
might
to
the
floor
of
the
cart
good
gracious
why
when
my
head
is
going
round
like
a
whirlpool
there
you
come
along
with
your
and
he
lifted
his
cap
to
wipe
away
the
drops
of
perspiration
from
his
sunburnt
brow
the
courtyard
was
full
of
bareheaded
peasants
in
kaftans
or
simple
shirts
women
clad
in
the
national
dress
and
wearing
striped
handkerchiefs
and
barefooted
little
ones
the
latter
holding
their
mothers
hands
or
crowding
round
the
all
were
chattering
among
themselves
as
they
stared
at
the
carriage
one
of
the
postillions
an
old
man
dressed
in
a
winter
cap
and
cloak
took
hold
of
the
pole
of
the
carriage
and
tried
it
carefully
while
the
other
postillion
a
young
man
in
a
white
blouse
with
pink
gussets
on
the
sleeves
and
a
black
lamb
cap
which
he
kept
cocking
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
as
he
arranged
his
flaxen
hair
laid
his
overcoat
upon
the
box
slung
the
reins
over
it
and
cracked
his
thonged
whip
as
he
looked
now
at
his
boots
and
now
at
the
other
drivers
where
they
stood
greasing
the
wheels
of
the
cart
one
driver
lifting
up
each
wheel
in
turn
and
the
other
driver
applying
the
grease
tired
of
various
hues
stood
lashing
away
flies
with
their
tails
near
the
gate
some
stamping
their
great
hairy
legs
blinking
their
eyes
and
dozing
some
leaning
wearily
against
their
neighbours
and
others
cropping
the
leaves
and
stalks
of
fern
which
grew
near
the
some
of
the
dogs
were
lying
panting
in
the
sun
while
others
were
slinking
under
the
vehicles
to
lick
the
grease
from
the
wheels
the
air
was
filled
with
a
sort
of
dusty
mist
and
the
horizon
was
in
colour
though
no
clouds
were
to
be
seen
a
strong
wind
from
the
south
was
raising
volumes
of
dust
from
the
roads
and
fields
shaking
the
poplars
and
in
the
garden
and
whirling
their
yellow
leaves
away
i
myself
was
sitting
at
a
window
and
waiting
impatiently
for
these
various
preparations
to
come
to
an
end
as
we
sat
together
by
the
table
to
pass
the
last
few
moments
en
famille
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
a
sad
moment
was
impending
on
the
contrary
the
most
trivial
thoughts
were
filling
my
brain
which
driver
was
going
to
drive
the
carriage
and
which
the
cart
which
of
us
would
sit
with
papa
and
which
with
karl
ivanitch
why
must
i
be
kept
forever
muffled
up
in
a
scarf
and
padded
boots
am
i
so
delicate
am
i
likely
to
be
frozen
i
thought
to
myself
i
wish
it
would
all
come
to
an
end
and
we
could
take
our
seats
and
to
whom
shall
i
give
the
list
of
the
children
s
linen
asked
natalia
savishna
of
mamma
as
she
entered
the
room
with
a
paper
in
her
hand
and
her
eyes
red
with
weeping
give
it
to
nicola
and
then
return
to
say
to
them
replied
mamma
the
old
woman
seemed
about
to
say
something
more
but
suddenly
stopped
short
covered
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
and
left
the
room
something
seemed
to
prick
at
my
heart
when
i
saw
that
gesture
of
hers
but
impatience
to
be
off
soon
drowned
all
other
feeling
and
i
continued
to
listen
indifferently
to
papa
and
mamma
as
they
talked
together
they
were
discussing
subjects
which
evidently
interested
neither
of
them
what
must
be
bought
for
the
house
what
would
princess
sophia
or
madame
julie
say
would
the
roads
be
good
and
so
forth
foka
entered
and
in
the
same
tone
and
with
the
same
air
as
though
he
were
announcing
luncheon
said
the
carriages
are
i
saw
mamma
tremble
and
turn
pale
at
the
announcement
just
as
though
it
were
something
unexpected
next
foka
was
ordered
to
shut
all
the
doors
of
the
room
this
amused
me
highly
as
though
we
needed
to
be
concealed
from
some
one
when
every
one
else
was
seated
foka
took
the
last
remaining
chair
scarcely
however
had
he
done
so
when
the
door
creaked
and
every
one
looked
that
way
natalia
savishna
entered
hastily
and
without
raising
her
eyes
sat
own
on
the
same
chair
as
foka
i
can
see
them
before
me
s
bald
head
and
wrinkled
set
face
and
beside
him
a
bent
kind
figure
in
a
cap
from
beneath
which
a
few
grey
hairs
were
straggling
the
pair
settled
themselves
together
on
the
chair
but
neither
of
them
looked
comfortable
i
continued
preoccupied
and
impatient
in
fact
the
ten
minutes
during
which
we
sat
there
with
closed
doors
seemed
to
me
an
hour
at
last
every
one
rose
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
began
to
say
papa
embraced
mamma
and
kissed
her
again
and
again
but
enough
he
said
presently
we
are
not
parting
for
no
but
it
sad
replied
mamma
her
voice
trembling
with
emotion
when
i
heard
that
faltering
voice
and
saw
those
quivering
lips
and
eyes
i
forgot
everything
else
in
the
world
i
felt
so
ill
and
miserable
that
i
would
gladly
have
run
away
rather
than
bid
her
farewell
i
felt
too
that
when
she
was
embracing
papa
she
was
embracing
us
all
she
clasped
woloda
to
her
several
times
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
him
after
which
i
approached
her
thinking
that
it
was
my
turn
nevertheless
she
took
him
again
and
again
to
her
heart
and
blessed
him
finally
i
caught
hold
of
her
and
clinging
to
her
wept
wept
thinking
of
nothing
in
the
world
but
my
grief
as
we
passed
out
to
take
our
seats
other
servants
pressed
round
us
in
the
hall
to
say
yet
their
requests
to
shake
hands
with
us
their
resounding
kisses
on
our
shoulders
the
fashion
in
which
inferiors
salute
their
superiors
in
russia
and
the
odour
of
their
greasy
heads
only
excited
in
me
a
feeling
akin
to
impatience
with
these
tiresome
people
the
same
feeling
made
me
bestow
nothing
more
than
a
very
cross
kiss
upon
natalia
s
cap
when
she
approached
to
take
leave
of
me
it
is
strange
that
i
should
still
retain
a
perfect
recollection
of
these
servants
faces
and
be
able
to
draw
them
with
the
most
minute
accuracy
in
my
mind
while
mamma
s
face
and
attitude
escape
me
entirely
it
may
be
that
it
is
because
at
that
moment
i
had
not
the
heart
to
look
at
her
closely
i
felt
that
if
i
did
so
our
mutual
grief
would
burst
forth
too
unrestrainedly
i
was
the
first
to
jump
into
the
carriage
and
to
take
one
of
the
hinder
seats
the
high
back
of
the
carriage
prevented
me
from
actually
seeing
her
yet
i
knew
by
instinct
that
mamma
was
still
there
shall
i
look
at
her
again
or
not
i
said
to
myself
well
just
for
the
last
time
and
i
peeped
out
towards
the
exactly
at
that
moment
mamma
moved
by
the
same
impulse
came
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
carriage
and
called
me
by
name
hearing
her
voice
behind
me
i
turned
round
but
so
hastily
that
our
heads
knocked
together
she
gave
a
sad
smile
and
kissed
me
convulsively
for
the
last
time
when
we
had
driven
away
a
few
paces
i
determined
to
look
at
her
once
more
the
wind
was
lifting
the
blue
handkerchief
from
her
head
as
bent
forward
and
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
she
moved
slowly
up
the
steps
foka
was
supporting
her
papa
said
nothing
as
he
sat
beside
me
i
felt
breathless
with
tears
felt
a
sensation
in
my
throat
as
though
i
were
going
to
choke
just
as
we
came
out
on
to
the
open
road
i
saw
a
white
handkerchief
waving
from
the
terrace
i
waved
mine
in
return
and
the
action
of
so
doing
calmed
me
a
little
i
still
went
on
crying
but
the
thought
that
my
tears
were
a
proof
of
my
affection
helped
to
soothe
and
comfort
me
after
a
little
while
i
began
to
recover
and
to
look
with
interest
at
objects
which
we
passed
and
at
the
of
the
led
horse
which
was
trotting
on
my
side
i
watched
how
it
would
swish
its
tail
how
it
would
lift
one
hoof
after
the
other
how
the
driver
s
thong
would
fall
upon
its
back
and
how
all
its
legs
would
then
seem
to
jump
together
and
the
with
the
rings
on
it
to
jump
too
the
whole
covered
with
the
horse
s
foam
then
i
would
look
at
the
rolling
stretches
of
ripe
corn
at
the
dark
ploughed
fields
where
ploughs
and
peasants
and
horses
with
foals
were
working
at
their
footprints
and
at
the
box
of
the
carriage
to
see
who
was
driving
us
until
though
my
face
was
still
wet
with
tears
my
thoughts
had
strayed
far
from
her
with
whom
i
had
just
parted
parted
perhaps
for
ever
yet
ever
and
again
something
would
recall
her
to
my
memory
i
remembered
too
how
the
evening
before
i
had
found
a
mushroom
under
the
how
lubotshka
had
quarrelled
with
katenka
as
to
whose
it
should
be
and
how
they
had
both
of
them
wept
when
taking
leave
of
us
i
felt
sorry
to
be
parted
from
them
and
from
natalia
savishna
and
from
the
avenue
and
from
foka
yes
even
the
horrid
mimi
i
longed
for
i
longed
for
everything
at
home
and
poor
mamma
the
tears
rushed
to
my
eyes
again
yet
even
this
mood
passed
away
before
long
xv
childhood
happy
happy
time
of
childhood
how
can
we
help
loving
and
dwelling
upon
its
recollections
they
cheer
and
elevate
the
soul
and
become
to
one
a
source
of
higher
joys
sometimes
when
dreaming
of
bygone
days
i
fancy
that
tired
out
with
running
about
i
have
sat
down
as
of
old
in
my
high
by
the
it
is
late
and
i
have
long
since
drunk
my
cup
of
milk
my
eyes
are
heavy
with
sleep
as
i
sit
there
and
listen
how
could
i
not
listen
seeing
that
mamma
is
speaking
to
somebody
and
that
the
sound
of
her
voice
is
so
melodious
and
kind
how
much
its
echoes
recall
to
my
heart
with
my
eyes
veiled
with
drowsiness
i
gaze
at
her
wistfully
suddenly
she
seems
to
grow
smaller
and
smaller
and
her
face
vanishes
to
a
point
yet
i
can
still
see
it
can
still
see
her
as
she
looks
at
me
and
smiles
somehow
it
pleases
me
to
see
her
grown
so
small
i
blink
and
blink
yet
she
looks
no
larger
than
a
boy
reflected
in
the
pupil
of
an
eye
then
i
rouse
myself
and
the
picture
fades
once
more
i
my
eyes
and
cast
about
to
try
and
recall
the
dream
but
it
has
gone
i
rise
to
my
feet
only
to
fall
back
comfortably
into
the
armchair
there
you
are
failing
asleep
again
little
nicolas
says
mamma
you
had
better
go
to
no
i
won
t
go
to
sleep
mamma
i
reply
though
almost
inaudibly
for
pleasant
dreams
are
filling
all
my
soul
the
sound
sleep
of
childhood
is
weighing
my
eyelids
down
and
for
a
few
moments
i
sink
into
slumber
and
oblivion
until
awakened
by
some
one
i
feel
in
my
sleep
as
though
a
soft
hand
were
caressing
me
i
know
it
by
the
touch
and
though
still
dreaming
i
seize
hold
of
it
and
press
it
to
my
lips
every
one
else
has
gone
to
bed
and
only
one
candle
remains
burning
in
the
mamma
has
said
that
she
herself
will
wake
me
she
sits
down
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
in
which
i
am
asleep
with
her
soft
hand
stroking
my
hair
and
i
hear
her
beloved
voice
say
in
my
ear
get
up
my
darling
it
is
time
to
go
no
envious
gaze
sees
her
now
she
is
not
afraid
to
shed
upon
me
the
whole
of
her
tenderness
and
love
i
do
not
wake
up
yet
i
kiss
and
kiss
her
hand
get
up
then
my
she
passes
her
other
arm
round
my
neck
and
her
fingers
tickle
me
as
they
move
across
it
the
room
is
quiet
and
in
but
the
tickling
has
touched
my
nerves
and
i
begin
to
awake
mamma
is
sitting
near
me
that
i
can
tell
and
touching
me
i
can
hear
her
voice
and
feel
her
presence
this
at
last
rouses
me
to
spring
up
to
throw
my
arms
around
her
neck
to
hide
my
head
in
her
bosom
and
to
say
with
a
sigh
ah
dear
darling
mamma
how
much
i
love
you
she
smiles
her
sad
enchanting
smile
takes
my
head
between
her
two
hands
kisses
me
on
the
forehead
and
lifts
me
on
to
her
lap
do
you
love
me
so
much
then
she
says
then
after
a
few
moments
silence
she
continues
and
you
must
love
me
always
and
never
forget
me
if
your
mamma
should
no
longer
be
here
will
you
promise
never
to
forget
her
never
nicolinka
and
she
kisses
me
more
fondly
than
ever
oh
but
you
must
not
speak
so
darling
mamma
my
own
darling
mamma
i
exclaim
as
i
clasp
her
knees
and
tears
of
joy
and
love
fall
from
my
eyes
how
after
scenes
like
this
i
would
go
upstairs
and
stand
before
the
ikons
and
say
with
a
rapturous
feeling
god
bless
papa
and
mamma
and
repeat
a
prayer
for
my
beloved
mother
which
my
childish
lips
had
learnt
to
love
of
god
and
of
her
blending
strangely
in
a
single
emotion
after
saying
my
prayers
i
would
wrap
myself
up
in
the
bedclothes
my
heart
would
feel
light
peaceful
and
happy
and
one
dream
would
follow
another
dreams
of
what
they
were
all
of
them
vague
but
all
of
them
full
of
pure
love
and
of
a
sort
of
expectation
of
happiness
i
remember
too
that
i
used
to
think
about
karl
ivanitch
and
his
sad
lot
he
was
the
only
unhappy
being
whom
i
knew
and
so
sorry
would
i
feel
for
him
and
so
much
did
i
love
him
that
tears
would
fall
from
my
eyes
as
i
thought
may
god
give
him
happiness
and
enable
me
to
help
him
and
to
lessen
his
sorrow
i
could
make
any
sacrifice
for
him
usually
also
there
would
be
some
favourite
toy
a
china
dog
or
hare
stuck
into
the
behind
the
pillow
and
it
would
please
me
to
think
how
warm
and
comfortable
and
well
it
was
there
also
i
would
pray
god
to
make
every
one
happy
so
that
every
one
might
be
contented
and
also
to
send
fine
weather
for
our
walk
then
i
would
turn
myself
over
on
to
the
other
side
and
thoughts
and
dreams
would
become
jumbled
and
entangled
together
until
at
last
i
slept
soundly
and
peacefully
though
with
a
face
wet
with
tears
do
in
after
life
the
freshness
and
the
craving
for
love
and
for
strength
of
faith
ever
return
which
we
experience
in
our
childhood
s
years
what
better
time
is
there
in
our
lives
than
when
the
two
best
of
virtues
innocent
gaiety
and
a
boundless
yearning
for
affection
are
our
sole
objects
of
pursuit
where
now
are
our
ardent
prayers
where
now
are
our
best
gifts
the
pure
tears
of
emotion
which
a
guardian
angel
dries
with
a
smile
as
he
sheds
upon
us
lovely
dreams
of
ineffable
childish
joy
can
it
be
that
life
has
left
such
heavy
traces
upon
one
s
heart
that
those
tears
and
ecstasies
are
for
ever
vanished
can
it
be
that
there
remains
to
us
only
the
recollection
of
them
xvi
rather
less
than
a
month
after
our
arrival
in
moscow
i
was
sitting
upstairs
in
my
grandmamma
s
house
and
doing
some
writing
at
a
large
table
opposite
to
me
sat
the
drawing
master
who
was
giving
a
few
finishing
touches
to
the
head
of
a
turbaned
turk
executed
in
black
pencil
woloda
with
neck
was
standing
behind
the
drawing
master
and
looking
over
his
shoulder
the
head
was
woloda
s
first
production
in
pencil
and
grandmamma
s
the
masterpiece
was
to
be
presented
to
her
aren
t
you
going
to
put
a
little
more
shadow
there
said
woloda
to
the
master
as
he
raised
himself
on
tiptoe
and
pointed
to
the
turk
s
neck
no
it
is
not
necessary
the
master
replied
as
he
put
pencil
and
into
a
japanned
folding
box
it
is
just
right
now
and
you
need
not
do
anything
more
to
it
as
for
you
nicolinka
he
added
rising
and
glancing
askew
at
the
turk
won
t
you
tell
us
your
great
secret
at
last
what
are
you
going
to
give
your
grandmamma
i
think
another
head
would
be
your
best
gift
but
gentlemen
and
taking
his
hat
and
cardboard
he
departed
i
too
had
thought
that
another
head
than
the
one
at
which
i
had
been
working
would
be
a
better
gift
so
when
we
were
told
that
grandmamma
s
was
soon
to
come
round
and
that
we
must
each
of
us
have
a
present
ready
for
her
i
had
taken
it
into
my
head
to
write
some
verses
in
honour
of
the
occasion
and
had
forthwith
composed
two
rhymed
couplets
hoping
that
the
rest
would
soon
materialise
i
really
do
not
know
how
the
idea
one
so
peculiar
for
a
child
came
to
occur
to
me
but
i
know
that
i
liked
it
vastly
and
answered
all
questions
on
the
subject
of
my
gift
by
declaring
that
i
should
soon
have
something
ready
for
grandmamma
but
was
not
going
to
say
what
it
was
contrary
to
my
expectation
i
found
that
after
the
first
two
couplets
executed
in
the
initial
heat
of
enthusiasm
even
my
most
strenuous
efforts
refused
to
produce
another
one
i
began
to
read
different
poems
in
our
books
but
neither
dimitrieff
nor
derzhavin
could
help
me
on
the
contrary
they
only
confirmed
my
sense
of
incompetence
knowing
however
that
karl
ivanitch
was
fond
of
writing
verses
i
stole
softly
upstairs
to
burrow
among
his
papers
and
found
among
a
number
of
german
verses
some
in
the
russian
language
which
seemed
to
have
come
from
his
own
pen
to
l
remember
near
remember
far
remember
me
be
faithful
and
for
ever
aye
still
beyond
the
grave
remember
that
i
have
well
loved
thee
karl
these
verses
which
were
written
in
a
fine
round
hand
on
thin
pleased
me
with
the
touching
sentiment
with
which
they
seemed
to
be
inspired
i
learnt
them
by
heart
and
decided
to
take
them
as
a
model
the
thing
was
much
easier
now
by
the
time
the
had
arrived
i
had
completed
a
congratulatory
ode
and
sat
down
to
the
table
in
our
to
copy
them
out
on
vellum
two
sheets
were
soon
spoiled
not
because
i
found
it
necessary
to
alter
anything
the
verses
seemed
to
me
perfect
but
because
after
the
third
line
the
of
each
successive
one
would
go
curving
upward
and
making
it
plain
to
all
the
world
that
the
whole
thing
had
been
written
with
a
want
of
adherence
to
the
horizontal
a
thing
which
i
could
not
bear
to
see
the
third
sheet
also
came
out
crooked
but
i
determined
to
make
it
do
in
my
verses
i
congratulated
grandmamma
wished
her
many
happy
returns
and
concluded
thus
endeavouring
you
to
please
and
cheer
we
love
you
like
our
mother
this
seemed
to
me
not
bad
yet
it
offended
my
ear
somehow
you
our
dear
i
repeated
to
myself
what
other
rhyme
could
i
use
instead
of
dear
fear
steer
well
it
must
go
at
that
at
least
the
verses
are
better
than
karl
ivanitch
accordingly
i
added
the
last
verse
to
the
rest
then
i
went
into
our
bedroom
and
recited
the
whole
poem
aloud
with
much
feeling
and
gesticulation
the
verses
were
altogether
guiltless
of
metre
but
i
did
not
stop
to
consider
that
yet
the
last
one
displeased
me
more
than
ever
as
i
sat
on
my
bed
i
thought
why
on
earth
did
i
write
like
our
mother
dear
she
is
not
here
and
therefore
she
need
never
have
been
mentioned
true
i
love
and
respect
grandmamma
but
she
is
not
quite
the
same
as
why
did
i
write
that
what
did
i
go
and
tell
a
lie
for
they
may
be
verses
only
yet
i
needn
t
quite
have
done
at
that
moment
the
tailor
arrived
with
some
new
clothes
for
us
well
so
be
it
i
said
in
much
vexation
as
i
crammed
the
verses
hastily
under
my
pillow
and
ran
down
to
adorn
myself
in
the
new
moscow
garments
they
fitted
the
brown
jacket
with
yellow
buttons
a
garment
made
and
not
to
allow
room
for
growth
as
in
the
country
and
the
black
trousers
also
so
that
they
displayed
the
figure
and
lay
smoothly
over
the
boots
at
last
i
have
real
trousers
on
i
thought
as
i
looked
at
my
legs
with
the
utmost
satisfaction
i
concealed
from
every
one
the
fact
that
the
new
clothes
were
horribly
tight
and
uncomfortable
but
on
the
contrary
said
that
if
there
were
a
fault
it
was
that
they
were
not
tight
enough
for
a
long
while
i
stood
before
the
as
i
combed
my
elaborately
pomaded
head
but
try
as
i
would
i
could
not
reduce
the
topmost
hairs
on
the
crown
to
order
as
soon
as
ever
i
left
off
combing
them
they
sprang
up
again
and
radiated
in
different
directions
thus
giving
my
face
a
ridiculous
expression
karl
ivanitch
was
dressing
in
another
room
and
i
heard
some
one
bring
him
his
blue
frockcoat
and
then
at
the
door
leading
downstairs
i
heard
a
s
voice
and
went
to
see
what
she
wanted
in
her
hand
she
held
a
shirt
which
she
said
she
had
been
sitting
up
all
night
to
get
ready
i
took
it
and
asked
if
grandmamma
was
up
yet
oh
yes
she
has
had
her
coffee
and
the
priest
has
come
my
word
but
you
look
a
fine
little
fellow
added
the
girl
with
a
smile
at
my
new
clothes
this
observation
made
me
blush
so
i
whirled
round
on
one
leg
snapped
my
fingers
and
went
skipping
away
in
the
hope
that
by
these
manoeuvres
i
should
make
her
sensible
that
even
yet
she
had
not
realised
quite
what
a
fine
fellow
i
was
however
when
i
took
the
shirt
to
karl
i
found
that
he
did
not
need
it
having
taken
another
one
standing
before
a
small
he
tied
his
cravat
with
both
hands
trying
by
various
motions
of
his
head
to
see
whether
it
fitted
him
comfortably
or
not
and
then
took
us
down
to
see
grandmamma
to
this
day
i
can
not
help
laughing
when
i
remember
what
a
smell
of
pomade
the
three
of
us
left
behind
us
on
the
staircase
as
we
descended
karl
was
carrying
a
box
which
he
had
made
himself
woloda
his
drawing
and
i
my
verses
while
each
of
us
also
had
a
form
of
words
ready
with
which
to
present
his
gift
just
as
karl
opened
the
door
the
priest
put
on
his
vestment
and
began
to
say
prayers
during
the
ceremony
grandmamma
stood
leaning
over
the
back
of
a
chair
with
her
head
bent
down
near
her
stood
papa
he
turned
and
smiled
at
us
as
we
hurriedly
thrust
our
presents
behind
our
backs
and
tried
to
remain
unobserved
by
the
door
the
whole
effect
of
a
surprise
upon
which
we
had
been
counting
was
entirely
lost
when
at
last
every
one
had
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
i
became
intolerably
oppressed
with
a
sudden
invincible
and
deadly
attack
of
shyness
so
that
the
courage
to
offer
my
present
completely
failed
me
i
hid
myself
behind
karl
ivanitch
who
solemnly
congratulated
grandmamma
and
transferring
his
box
from
his
right
hand
to
his
left
presented
it
to
her
then
he
withdrew
a
few
steps
to
make
way
for
woloda
grandmamma
seemed
highly
pleased
with
the
box
which
was
adorned
with
a
gold
border
and
smiled
in
the
most
friendly
manner
in
order
to
express
her
gratitude
yet
it
was
evident
that
she
did
not
know
where
to
set
the
box
down
and
this
probably
accounts
for
the
fact
that
she
handed
it
to
papa
at
the
same
time
bidding
him
observe
how
beautifully
it
was
made
his
curiosity
satisfied
papa
handed
the
box
to
the
priest
who
also
seemed
particularly
delighted
with
it
and
looked
with
astonishment
first
at
the
article
itself
and
then
at
the
artist
who
could
make
such
wonderful
things
then
woloda
presented
his
turk
and
received
a
similarly
flattering
ovation
on
all
sides
it
was
my
turn
now
and
grandmamma
turned
to
me
with
her
kindest
smile
those
who
have
experienced
what
embarrassment
is
know
that
it
is
a
feeling
which
grows
in
direct
proportion
to
delay
while
decision
decreases
in
similar
measure
in
other
words
the
longer
the
condition
lasts
the
more
invincible
does
it
become
and
the
smaller
does
the
power
of
decision
come
to
be
my
last
remnants
of
nerve
and
energy
had
forsaken
me
while
karl
and
woloda
had
been
offering
their
presents
and
my
shyness
now
reached
its
culminating
point
i
felt
the
blood
rushing
from
my
heart
to
my
head
one
blush
succeeding
another
across
my
face
and
drops
of
perspiration
beginning
to
stand
out
on
my
brow
and
nose
my
ears
were
burning
i
trembled
from
head
to
foot
and
though
i
kept
changing
from
one
foot
to
the
other
i
remained
rooted
where
i
stood
well
nicolinka
tell
us
what
you
have
brought
said
papa
is
it
a
box
or
a
drawing
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
with
a
trembling
hand
held
out
the
folded
fatal
paper
but
my
voiced
failed
me
completely
and
i
stood
before
grandmamma
in
silence
i
could
not
get
rid
of
the
dreadful
idea
that
instead
of
a
display
of
the
expected
drawing
some
bad
verses
of
mine
were
about
to
be
read
aloud
before
every
one
and
that
the
words
our
mother
dear
would
clearly
prove
that
i
had
never
loved
but
had
only
forgotten
her
how
shall
i
express
my
sufferings
when
grandmamma
began
to
read
my
poetry
aloud
when
unable
to
decipher
it
she
stopped
and
looked
at
papa
with
a
smile
which
i
took
to
be
one
of
ridicule
when
she
did
not
pronounce
it
as
i
had
meant
it
to
be
pronounced
and
when
her
weak
sight
not
allowing
her
to
finish
it
she
handed
the
paper
to
papa
and
requested
him
to
read
it
all
over
again
from
the
beginning
i
fancied
that
she
must
have
done
this
last
because
she
did
not
like
to
read
such
a
lot
of
stupid
crookedly
written
stuff
herself
yet
wanted
to
point
out
to
papa
my
utter
lack
of
feeling
i
expected
him
to
slap
me
in
the
face
with
the
verses
and
say
you
bad
boy
so
you
have
forgotten
your
mamma
take
that
for
it
yet
nothing
of
the
sort
happened
on
the
contrary
when
the
whole
had
been
read
grandmamma
said
charming
and
kissed
me
on
the
forehead
then
our
presents
together
with
two
cambric
and
a
engraved
with
mamma
s
portrait
were
laid
on
the
table
attached
to
the
great
voltairian
in
which
grandmamma
always
sat
the
princess
barbara
ilinitsha
announced
one
of
the
two
footmen
who
used
to
stand
behind
grandmamma
s
carriage
but
grandmamma
was
looking
thoughtfully
at
the
portrait
on
the
and
returned
no
answer
shall
i
show
her
in
madam
repeated
the
footman
xvii
the
princess
kornakoff
yes
show
her
in
said
grandmamma
settling
herself
as
far
back
in
her
as
possible
the
princess
was
a
woman
of
about
small
and
delicate
with
a
shrivelled
skin
and
disagreeable
eyes
the
expression
of
which
contradicted
the
unnaturally
suave
look
of
the
rest
of
her
face
underneath
her
velvet
bonnet
adorned
with
an
ostrich
feather
was
visible
some
reddish
hair
while
against
the
unhealthy
colour
of
her
skin
her
eyebrows
and
eyelashes
looked
even
lighter
and
redder
that
they
would
other
wise
have
done
yet
for
all
that
her
animated
movements
small
hands
and
peculiarly
dry
features
communicated
something
aristocratic
and
energetic
to
her
general
appearance
she
talked
a
great
deal
and
to
judge
from
her
eloquence
belonged
to
that
class
of
persons
who
always
speak
as
though
some
one
were
contradicting
them
even
though
no
one
else
may
be
saying
a
word
first
she
would
raise
her
voice
then
lower
it
and
then
take
on
a
fresh
access
of
vivacity
as
she
looked
at
the
persons
present
but
not
participating
in
the
conversation
with
an
air
of
endeavouring
to
draw
them
into
it
although
the
princess
kissed
grandmamma
s
hand
and
repeatedly
called
her
my
good
aunt
i
could
see
that
grandmamma
did
not
care
much
about
her
for
she
kept
raising
her
eyebrows
in
a
peculiar
way
while
listening
to
the
princess
s
excuses
why
prince
michael
had
been
prevented
from
calling
and
congratulating
grandmamma
as
he
would
like
to
have
at
length
however
she
answered
the
princess
s
french
with
russian
and
with
a
sharp
accentuation
of
certain
words
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
kindness
she
said
as
for
prince
michael
s
absence
pray
do
not
mention
it
he
has
so
much
else
to
do
besides
what
pleasure
could
he
find
in
coming
to
see
an
old
woman
like
me
then
without
allowing
the
princess
time
to
reply
she
went
on
how
are
your
children
my
dear
well
thank
god
aunt
they
grow
and
do
their
lessons
and
play
particularly
my
eldest
one
etienne
who
is
so
wild
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
keep
him
in
order
still
he
is
a
clever
and
promising
boy
would
you
believe
it
cousin
this
last
to
papa
since
grandmamma
altogether
uninterested
in
the
princess
s
children
had
turned
to
us
taken
my
verses
out
from
beneath
the
presentation
box
and
unfolded
them
again
would
you
believe
it
but
one
day
not
long
ago
and
leaning
over
towards
papa
the
princess
related
something
or
other
with
great
vivacity
then
her
tale
concluded
she
laughed
and
with
a
questioning
look
at
papa
went
on
what
a
boy
cousin
he
ought
to
have
been
whipped
but
the
trick
was
so
spirited
and
amusing
that
i
let
him
then
the
princess
looked
at
grandmamma
and
laughed
again
ah
so
you
whip
your
children
do
you
said
grandmamma
with
a
significant
lift
of
her
eyebrows
and
laying
a
peculiar
stress
on
the
word
alas
my
good
aunt
replied
the
princess
in
a
sort
of
tolerant
tone
and
with
another
glance
at
papa
i
know
your
views
on
the
subject
but
must
beg
to
be
allowed
to
differ
with
them
however
much
i
have
thought
over
and
read
and
talked
about
the
matter
i
have
always
been
forced
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
children
must
be
ruled
through
fear
to
make
something
of
a
child
you
must
make
it
fear
something
is
it
not
so
cousin
and
what
pray
do
children
fear
so
much
as
a
rod
as
she
spoke
she
seemed
to
look
inquiringly
at
woloda
and
myself
and
i
confess
that
i
did
not
feel
altogether
comfortable
whatever
you
may
say
she
went
on
a
boy
of
twelve
or
even
of
fourteen
is
still
a
child
and
should
be
whipped
as
such
but
with
girls
perhaps
it
is
another
how
lucky
it
is
that
i
am
not
her
son
i
thought
to
myself
oh
very
well
said
grandmamma
folding
up
my
verses
and
replacing
them
beneath
the
box
as
though
after
that
exposition
of
views
the
princess
was
unworthy
of
the
honour
of
listening
to
such
a
production
very
well
my
dear
she
repeated
but
please
tell
me
how
in
return
you
can
look
for
any
delicate
sensibility
from
your
children
evidently
grandmamma
thought
this
argument
unanswerable
for
she
cut
the
subject
short
by
adding
however
it
is
a
point
on
which
people
must
follow
their
own
the
princess
did
not
choose
to
reply
but
smiled
condescendingly
and
as
though
out
of
indulgence
to
the
strange
prejudices
of
a
person
whom
she
only
pretended
to
revere
oh
by
the
way
pray
introduce
me
to
your
young
people
she
went
on
presently
as
she
threw
us
another
gracious
smile
thereupon
we
rose
and
stood
looking
at
the
princess
without
in
the
least
knowing
what
we
ought
to
do
to
show
that
we
were
being
introduced
kiss
the
princess
s
hand
said
papa
well
i
hope
you
will
love
your
old
aunt
she
said
to
woloda
kissing
his
hair
even
though
we
are
not
near
relatives
but
i
value
friendship
far
more
than
i
do
degrees
of
relationship
she
added
to
grandmamma
who
nevertheless
remained
hostile
and
replied
eh
my
dear
is
that
what
they
think
of
relationships
nowadays
here
is
my
man
of
the
world
put
in
papa
indicating
woloda
and
here
is
my
poet
he
added
as
i
kissed
the
small
dry
hand
of
the
princess
with
a
vivid
picture
in
my
mind
of
that
same
hand
holding
a
rod
and
applying
it
vigorously
which
one
is
the
poet
asked
the
princess
this
little
one
replied
papa
smiling
the
one
with
the
tuft
of
hair
on
his
why
need
he
bother
about
my
tuft
i
thought
to
myself
as
i
retired
into
a
corner
is
there
nothing
else
for
him
to
talk
about
i
had
strange
ideas
on
manly
beauty
i
considered
karl
ivanitch
one
of
the
handsomest
men
in
the
world
and
myself
so
ugly
that
i
had
no
need
to
deceive
myself
on
that
point
therefore
any
remark
on
the
subject
of
my
exterior
offended
me
extremely
i
well
remember
how
one
day
after
luncheon
i
was
then
six
years
of
age
the
talk
fell
upon
my
personal
appearance
and
how
mamma
tried
to
find
good
features
in
my
face
and
said
that
i
had
clever
eyes
and
a
charming
smile
how
nevertheless
when
papa
had
examined
me
and
proved
the
contrary
she
was
obliged
to
confess
that
i
was
ugly
and
how
when
the
meal
was
over
and
i
went
to
pay
her
my
respects
she
said
as
she
patted
my
cheek
you
know
nicolinka
nobody
will
ever
love
you
for
your
face
alone
so
you
must
try
all
the
more
to
be
a
good
and
clever
although
these
words
of
hers
confirmed
in
me
my
conviction
that
i
was
not
handsome
they
also
confirmed
in
me
an
ambition
to
be
just
such
a
boy
as
she
had
indicated
yet
i
had
my
moments
of
despair
at
my
ugliness
for
i
thought
that
no
human
being
with
such
a
large
nose
such
thick
lips
and
such
small
grey
eyes
as
mine
could
ever
hope
to
attain
happiness
on
this
earth
i
used
to
ask
god
to
perform
a
miracle
by
changing
me
into
a
beauty
and
would
have
given
all
that
i
possessed
or
ever
hoped
to
possess
to
have
a
handsome
face

prince

ivanovitch
when
the
princess
had
heard
my
verses
and
overwhelmed
the
writer
of
them
with
praise
grandmamma
softened
to
her
a
little
she
began
to
address
her
in
french
and
to
cease
calling
her
my
likewise
she
invited
her
to
return
that
evening
with
her
children
this
invitation
having
been
accepted
the
princess
took
her
leave
after
that
so
many
other
callers
came
to
congratulate
grandmamma
that
the
courtyard
was
crowded
all
day
long
with
carriages
good
morning
my
dear
cousin
was
the
greeting
of
one
guest
in
particular
as
he
entered
the
room
and
kissed
grandmamma
s
hand
he
was
a
man
of
seventy
with
a
stately
figure
clad
in
a
military
uniform
and
adorned
with
large
epaulettes
an
embroidered
collar
and
a
white
cross
round
the
neck
his
face
with
its
quiet
and
open
expression
as
well
as
the
simplicity
and
ease
of
his
manners
greatly
pleased
me
for
in
spite
of
the
thin
of
hair
which
was
all
that
was
now
left
to
him
and
the
want
of
teeth
disclosed
by
the
set
of
his
upper
lip
his
face
was
a
remarkably
handsome
one
thanks
to
his
fine
character
handsome
exterior
remarkable
valour
influential
relatives
and
above
all
good
fortune
prince
ivan
ivanovitch
had
early
made
himself
a
career
as
that
career
progressed
his
ambition
had
met
with
a
success
which
left
nothing
more
to
be
sought
for
in
that
direction
from
his
earliest
youth
upward
he
had
prepared
himself
to
fill
the
exalted
station
in
the
world
to
which
fate
actually
called
him
later
wherefore
although
in
his
prosperous
life
as
in
the
lives
of
all
there
had
been
failures
misfortunes
and
cares
he
had
never
lost
his
quietness
of
character
his
elevated
tone
of
thought
or
his
peculiarly
moral
religious
bent
of
mind
consequently
though
he
had
won
the
universal
esteem
of
his
fellows
he
had
done
so
less
through
his
important
position
than
through
his
perseverance
and
integrity
while
not
of
specially
distinguished
intellect
the
eminence
of
his
station
whence
he
could
afford
to
look
down
upon
all
petty
questions
had
caused
him
to
adopt
high
points
of
view
though
in
reality
he
was
kind
and
sympathetic
in
manner
he
appeared
cold
and
haughty
probably
for
the
reason
that
he
had
forever
to
be
on
his
guard
against
the
endless
claims
and
petitions
of
people
who
wished
to
profit
through
his
influence
yet
even
then
his
coldness
was
mitigated
by
the
polite
condescension
of
a
man
well
accustomed
to
move
in
the
highest
circles
of
society
his
culture
was
that
of
a
youth
of
the
end
of
the
last
century
he
had
read
everything
whether
philosophy
or
belles
lettres
which
that
age
had
produced
in
france
and
loved
to
quote
from
racine
corneille
boileau
moliere
montaigne
and
fenelon
likewise
he
had
gleaned
much
history
from
segur
and
much
of
the
old
classics
from
french
translations
of
them
but
for
mathematics

philosophy
or
contemporary
literature
he
cared
nothing
whatever
however
he
knew
how
to
be
silent
in
conversation
as
well
as
when
to
make
general
remarks
on
authors
whom
he
had
never
read
such
as
goethe
schiller
and
byron
moreover
despite
his
exclusively
french
education
he
was
simple
in
speech
and
hated
originality
which
he
called
the
mark
of
an
untutored
nature
wherever
he
lived
society
was
a
necessity
to
him
and
both
in
moscow
and
the
country
he
had
his
reception
days
on
which
practically
all
the
town
called
upon
him
an
introduction
from
him
was
a
passport
to
every
few
young
and
pretty
ladies
in
society
objected
to
offering
him
their
rosy
cheeks
for
a
paternal
salute
and
people
even
in
the
highest
positions
felt
flattered
by
invitations
to
his
parties
the
prince
had
few
friends
left
now
like
grandmamma
that
is
to
say
few
friends
who
were
of
the
same
standing
as
himself
who
had
had
the
same
sort
of
education
and
who
saw
things
from
the
same
point
of
view
wherefore
he
greatly
valued
his
intimate
friendship
with
her
and
always
showed
her
the
highest
respect
i
hardly
dared
to
look
at
the
prince
since
the
honour
paid
him
on
all
sides
the
huge
epaulettes
the
peculiar
pleasure
with
which
grandmamma
received
him
and
the
fact
that
he
alone
seemed
in
no
way
afraid
of
her
but
addressed
her
with
perfect
freedom
even
being
so
daring
as
to
call
her
cousin
awakened
in
me
a
feeling
of
reverence
for
his
person
almost
equal
to
that
which
i
felt
for
grandmamma
herself
on
being
shown
my
verses
he
called
me
to
his
side
and
said
who
knows
my
cousin
but
that
he
may
prove
to
be
a
second
derzhavin
nevertheless
he
pinched
my
cheek
so
hard
that
i
was
only
prevented
from
crying
by
the
thought
that
it
must
be
meant
for
a
caress
gradually
the
other
guests
dispersed
and
with
them
papa
and
woloda
thus
only
grandmamma
the
prince
and
myself
were
left
in
the
why
has
our
dear
natalia
nicolaevna
not
come
asked
the
prince
after
a
silence
ah
my
friend
replied
grandmamma
lowering
her
voice
and
laying
a
hand
upon
the
sleeve
of
his
uniform
she
would
certainly
have
come
if
she
had
been
at
liberty
to
do
what
she
likes
she
wrote
to
me
that
peter
had
proposed
bringing
her
with
him
to
town
but
that
she
had
refused
since
their
income
had
not
been
good
this
year
and
she
could
see
no
real
reason
why
the
whole
family
need
come
to
moscow
seeing
that
lubotshka
was
as
yet
very
young
and
that
the
boys
were
living
with
me
a
fact
she
said
which
made
her
feel
as
safe
about
them
as
though
she
had
been
living
with
them
true
it
is
good
for
the
boys
to
be
here
went
on
grandmamma
yet
in
a
tone
which
showed
clearly
that
she
did
not
think
it
was
so
very
good
since
it
was
more
than
time
that
they
should
be
sent
to
moscow
to
study
as
well
as
to
learn
how
to
comport
themselves
in
society
what
sort
of
an
education
could
they
have
got
in
the
country
the
eldest
boy
will
soon
be
thirteen
and
the
second
one
eleven
as
yet
my
cousin
they
are
quite
untaught
and
do
not
know
even
how
to
enter
a
nevertheless
said
the
prince
i
can
not
understand
these
complaints
of
ruined
fortunes
he
has
a
very
handsome
income
and
natalia
has
chabarovska
where
we
used
to
act
plays
and
which
i
know
as
well
as
i
do
my
own
hand
it
is
a
splendid
property
and
ought
to
bring
in
an
excellent
well
said
grandmamma
with
a
sad
expression
on
her
face
i
do
not
mind
telling
you
as
my
most
intimate
friend
that
all
this
seems
to
me
a
mere
pretext
on
his
part
for
living
alone
for
strolling
about
from
club
to
club
for
attending
and
for
resorting
to
well
who
knows
what
she
suspects
nothing
you
know
her
angelic
sweetness
and
her
implicit
trust
of
him
in
everything
he
had
only
to
tell
her
that
the
children
must
go
to
moscow
and
that
she
must
be
left
behind
in
the
country
with
a
stupid
governess
for
company
for
her
to
believe
him
i
almost
think
that
if
he
were
to
say
that
the
children
must
be
whipped
just
as
the
princess
barbara
whips
hers
she
would
believe
even
that
and
grandmamma
leant
back
in
her
with
an
expression
of
contempt
then
after
a
moment
of
silence
during
which
she
took
her
handkerchief
out
of
her
pocket
to
wipe
away
a
few
tears
which
had
stolen
down
her
cheeks
she
went
on
yes
my
friend
i
often
think
that
he
can
not
value
and
understand
her
properly
and
that
for
all
her
goodness
and
love
of
him
and
her
endeavours
to
conceal
her
grief
which
however
as
i
know
only
too
well
exists
she
can
not
really
be
happy
with
him
mark
my
words
if
he
does
not
here
grandmamma
buried
her
face
in
the
handkerchief
ah
my
dear
old
friend
said
the
prince
reproachfully
i
think
you
are
unreasonable
why
grieve
and
weep
over
imagined
evils
that
is
not
right
i
have
known
him
a
long
time
and
feel
sure
that
he
is
an
attentive
kind
and
excellent
husband
as
well
as
which
is
the
chief
thing
of
all
a
perfectly
honourable
at
this
point
having
been
an
involuntary
auditor
of
a
conversation
not
meant
for
my
ears
i
stole
on
tiptoe
out
of
the
room
in
a
state
of
great
distress
xix
the
iwins
woloda
woloda
the
iwins
are
just
i
shouted
on
seeing
from
the
window
three
boys
in
blue
overcoats
and
followed
by
a
young
tutor
advancing
along
the
pavement
opposite
our
house
the
iwins
were
related
to
us
and
of
about
the
same
age
as
ourselves
we
had
made
their
acquaintance
soon
after
our
arrival
in
moscow
the
second
brother
seriosha
had
dark
curly
hair
a
strongly
pronounced
nose
very
bright
red
lips
which
never
being
quite
shut
showed
a
row
of
white
teeth
beautiful
eyes
and
an
uncommonly
bold
expression
of
face
he
never
smiled
but
was
either
wholly
serious
or
laughing
a
clear
merry
agreeable
laugh
his
striking
good
looks
had
captivated
me
from
the
first
and
i
felt
an
irresistible
attraction
towards
him
only
to
see
him
filled
me
with
pleasure
and
at
one
time
my
whole
mental
faculties
used
to
be
concentrated
in
the
wish
that
i
might
do
so
if
three
or
four
days
passed
without
my
seeing
him
i
felt
listless
and
ready
to
cry
awake
or
asleep
i
was
forever
dreaming
of
him
on
going
to
bed
i
used
to
see
him
in
my
dreams
and
when
i
had
shut
my
eyes
and
called
up
a
picture
of
him
i
hugged
the
vision
as
my
choicest
delight
so
much
store
did
i
set
upon
this
feeling
for
my
friend
that
i
never
mentioned
it
to
any
one
nevertheless
it
must
have
annoyed
him
to
see
my
admiring
eyes
constantly
fixed
upon
him
or
else
he
must
have
felt
no
reciprocal
attraction
for
he
always
preferred
to
play
and
talk
with
woloda
still
even
with
that
i
felt
satisfied
and
wished
and
asked
for
nothing
better
than
to
be
ready
at
any
time
to
make
any
sacrifice
for
him
likewise
over
and
above
the
strange
fascination
which
he
exercised
upon
me
i
always
felt
another
sensation
namely
a
dread
of
making
him
angry
of
offending
him
of
displeasing
him
was
this
because
his
face
bore
such
a
haughty
expression
or
because
i
despising
my
own
exterior
the
beautiful
in
others
or
lastly
and
most
probably
because
it
is
a
common
sign
of
affection
at
all
events
i
felt
as
much
fear
of
him
as
i
did
love
the
first
time
that
he
spoke
to
me
i
was
so
overwhelmed
with
sudden
happiness
that
i
turned
pale
then
red
and
could
not
utter
a
word
he
had
an
ugly
habit
of
blinking
when
considering
anything
seriously
as
well
as
of
twitching
his
nose
and
eyebrows
consequently
every
one
thought
that
this
habit
marred
his
face
yet
i
thought
it
such
a
nice
one
that
i
involuntarily
adopted
it
for
myself
until
a
few
days
after
i
had
made
his
acquaintance
grandmamma
suddenly
asked
me
whether
my
eyes
were
hurting
me
since
i
was
winking
like
an
owl
never
a
word
of
affection
passed
between
us
yet
he
felt
his
power
over
me
and
unconsciously
but
tyrannically
exercised
it
in
all
our
childish
intercourse
i
used
to
long
to
tell
him
all
that
was
in
my
heart
yet
was
too
much
afraid
of
him
to
be
frank
in
any
way
and
while
submitting
myself
to
his
will
tried
to
appear
merely
careless
and
indifferent
although
at
times
his
influence
seemed
irksome
and
intolerable
to
throw
it
off
was
beyond
my
strength
i
often
think
with
regret
of
that
fresh
beautiful
feeling
of
boundless
disinterested
love
which
came
to
an
end
without
having
ever
found
or
return
it
is
strange
how
when
a
child
i
always
longed
to
be
like
people
and
yet
how
i
have
often
longed
since
childhood
s
days
for
those
days
to
come
back
to
me
many
times
in
my
relations
with
seriosha
this
wish
to
resemble
people
put
a
rude
check
upon
the
love
that
was
waiting
to
expand
and
made
me
repress
it
not
only
was
i
afraid
of
kissing
him
or
of
taking
his
hand
and
saying
how
glad
i
was
to
see
him
but
i
even
dreaded
calling
him
seriosha
and
always
said
sergius
as
every
one
else
did
in
our
house
any
expression
of
affection
would
have
seemed
like
evidence
of
childishness
and
any
one
who
indulged
in
it
a
baby
not
having
yet
passed
through
those
bitter
experiences
which
enforce
upon
older
years
circumspection
and
coldness
i
deprived
myself
of
the
pure
delight
of
a
fresh
childish
instinct
for
the
absurd
purpose
of
trying
to
resemble
people
i
met
the
iwins
in
the
welcomed
them
and
then
ran
to
tell
grandmamma
of
their
arrival
with
an
expression
as
happy
as
though
she
were
certain
to
be
equally
delighted
then
never
taking
my
eyes
off
seriosha
i
conducted
the
visitors
to
the
and
eagerly
followed
every
movement
of
my
favourite
when
grandmamma
spoke
to
and
fixed
her
penetrating
glance
upon
him
i
experienced
that
mingled
sensation
of
pride
and
solicitude
which
an
artist
might
feel
when
waiting
for
revered
lips
to
pronounce
a
judgment
upon
his
work
with
grandmamma
s
permission
the
iwins
young
tutor
herr
frost
accompanied
us
into
the
little
back
garden
where
he
seated
himself
upon
a
bench
arranged
his
legs
in
a
tasteful
attitude
rested
his
cane
between
them
lighted
a
cigar
and
assumed
the
air
of
a
man
with
himself
he
was
a
german
but
of
a
very
different
sort
to
our
good
karl
ivanitch
in
the
first
place
he
spoke
both
russian
and
french
correctly
though
with
a
hard
accent
indeed
he
enjoyed
especially
among
the
ladies
the
reputation
of
being
a
very
accomplished
fellow
in
the
second
place
he
wore
a
reddish
moustache
a
large
gold
pin
set
with
a
ruby
a
black
satin
tie
and
a
very
fashionable
suit
lastly
he
was
young
with
a
handsome
face
and
fine
muscular
legs
it
was
clear
that
he
set
the
greatest
store
upon
the
latter
and
thought
them
beyond
compare
especially
as
regards
the
favour
of
the
ladies
consequently
whether
sitting
or
standing
he
always
tried
to
exhibit
them
in
the
most
favourable
light
in
short
he
was
a
type
of
the
young
whose
main
desire
is
to
be
thought
perfectly
gallant
and
gentlemanly
in
the
little
garden
merriment
reigned
in
fact
the
game
of
robbers
never
went
better
yet
an
incident
occurred
which
came
near
to
spoiling
it
seriosha
was
the
robber
and
in
pouncing
upon
some
travellers
he
fell
down
and
knocked
his
leg
so
badly
against
a
tree
that
i
thought
the
leg
must
be
broken
consequently
though
i
was
the
gendarme
and
therefore
bound
to
apprehend
him
i
only
asked
him
anxiously
when
i
reached
him
if
he
had
hurt
himself
very
much
nevertheless
this
threw
him
into
a
passion
and
made
him
exclaim
with
fists
clenched
and
in
a
voice
which
showed
by
its
faltering
what
pain
he
was
enduring
why
whatever
is
the
matter
is
this
playing
the
game
properly
you
ought
to
arrest
me
why
on
earth
don
t
you
do
so
this
he
repeated
several
times
and
then
seeing
woloda
and
the
elder
iwin
who
were
taking
the
part
of
the
travellers
jumping
and
running
about
the
path
he
suddenly
threw
himself
upon
them
with
a
shout
and
loud
laughter
to
effect
their
capture
i
can
not
express
my
wonder
and
delight
at
this
valiant
behaviour
of
my
hero
in
spite
of
the
severe
pain
he
had
not
only
refrained
from
crying
but
had
repressed
the
least
symptom
of
suffering
and
kept
his
eye
fixed
upon
the
game
shortly
after
this
occurrence
another
boy
ilinka
grap
joined
our
party
we
went
upstairs
and
seriosha
gave
me
an
opportunity
of
still
further
appreciating
and
taking
delight
in
his
manly
bravery
and
fortitude
this
was
how
it
was
ilinka
was
the
son
of
a
poor
foreigner
who
had
been
under
certain
obligations
to
my
grandpapa
and
now
thought
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
send
his
son
to
us
as
frequently
as
possible
yet
if
he
thought
that
the
acquaintance
would
procure
his
son
any
advancement
or
pleasure
he
was
entirely
mistaken
for
not
only
were
we
anything
but
friendly
to
ilinka
but
it
was
seldom
that
we
noticed
him
at
all
except
to
laugh
at
him
he
was
a
boy
of
thirteen
tall
and
thin
with
a
pale
birdlike
face
and
a
quiet
expression
though
poorly
dressed
he
always
had
his
head
so
thickly
pomaded
that
we
used
to
declare
that
on
warm
days
it
melted
and
ran
down
his
neck
when
i
think
of
him
now
it
seems
to
me
that
he
was
a
very
quiet
obliging
and
boy
but
at
the
time
i
thought
him
a
creature
so
contemptible
that
he
was
not
worth
either
attention
or
pity
upstairs
we
set
ourselves
to
astonish
each
other
with
gymnastic
tours
de
force
ilinka
watched
us
with
a
faint
smile
of
admiration
but
refused
an
invitation
to
attempt
a
similar
feat
saying
that
he
had
no
strength
seriosha
was
extremely
captivating
his
face
and
eyes
glowed
with
laughter
as
he
surprised
us
with
tricks
which
we
had
never
seen
before
he
jumped
over
three
chairs
put
together
turned
somersaults
right
across
the
room
and
finally
stood
on
his
head
on
a
pyramid
of
tatistchev
s
dictionaries
moving
his
legs
about
with
such
comical
rapidity
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
help
bursting
with
merriment
after
this
last
trick
he
pondered
for
a
moment
blinking
his
eyes
as
usual
and
then
went
up
to
ilinka
with
a
very
serious
face
try
and
do
that
he
said
it
is
not
really
ilinka
observing
that
the
general
attention
was
fixed
upon
him
blushed
and
said
in
an
almost
inaudible
voice
that
he
could
not
do
the
feat
well
what
does
he
mean
by
doing
nothing
at
all
what
a
girl
the
fellow
is
he
has
just
got
to
stand
on
his
head
and
seriosha
took
him
by
the
hand
yes
on
your
head
at
once
this
instant
this
instant
every
one
shouted
as
we
ran
upon
ilinka
and
dragged
him
to
the
dictionaries
despite
his
being
visibly
pale
and
frightened
leave
me
alone
you
are
tearing
my
jacket
cried
the
unhappy
victim
but
his
exclamations
of
despair
only
encouraged
us
the
more
we
were
dying
with
laughter
while
the
green
jacket
was
bursting
at
every
seam
woloda
and
the
eldest
iwin
took
his
head
and
placed
it
on
the
dictionaries
while
seriosha
and
i
seized
his
poor
thin
legs
his
struggles
had
stripped
them
upwards
to
the
knees
and
with
boisterous
laughter
held
them
uptight
the
youngest
iwin
superintending
his
general
equilibrium
suddenly
a
moment
of
silence
occurred
amid
our
boisterous
laughter
a
moment
during
which
nothing
was
to
be
heard
in
the
room
but
the
panting
of
the
miserable
ilinka
it
occurred
to
me
at
that
moment
that
after
all
there
was
nothing
so
very
comical
and
pleasant
in
all
this
now
that
s
a
boy
cried
seriosha
giving
ilinka
a
smack
with
his
hand
ilinka
said
nothing
but
made
such
desperate
movements
with
his
legs
to
free
himself
that
his
foot
suddenly
kicked
seriosha
in
the
eye
with
the
result
that
letting
go
of
ilinka
s
leg
and
covering
the
wounded
member
with
one
hand
seriosha
hit
out
at
him
with
all
his
might
with
the
other
one
of
course
ilinka
s
legs
slipped
down
as
sinking
exhausted
to
the
floor
and
with
tears
he
stammered
out
why
should
you
bully
me
so
the
poor
fellow
s
miserable
figure
with
its
streaming
tears
ruffled
hair
and
crumpled
trousers
revealing
dirty
boots
touched
us
a
little
and
we
stood
silent
and
trying
to
smile
seriosha
was
the
first
to
recover
himself
what
a
girl
what
a
gaby
he
said
giving
ilinka
a
slight
kick
he
can
t
take
things
in
fun
a
bit
well
get
up
you
are
an
utter
beast
that
s
what
you
are
said
ilinka
turning
miserably
away
and
sobbing
oh
oh
would
it
still
kick
and
show
temper
then
cried
seriosha
seizing
a
dictionary
and
throwing
it
at
the
unfortunate
boy
s
head
apparently
it
never
occurred
to
ilinka
to
take
refuge
from
the
missile
he
merely
guarded
his
head
with
his
hands
well
that
s
enough
now
added
seriosha
with
a
forced
laugh
you
deserve
to
be
hurt
if
you
can
t
take
things
in
fun
now
let
s
go
i
could
not
help
looking
with
some
compassion
at
the
miserable
creature
on
the
floor
as
his
face
buried
in
the
dictionary
he
lay
there
sobbing
almost
as
though
he
were
in
a
fit
oh
sergius
i
said
why
have
you
done
this
well
you
did
it
too
besides
i
did
not
cry
this
afternoon
when
i
knocked
my
leg
and
nearly
broke
true
enough
i
thought
ilinka
is
a
poor
whining
sort
of
a
chap
while
seriosha
is
a
boy
a
real
it
never
occurred
to
my
mind
that
possibly
poor
ilinka
was
suffering
far
less
from
bodily
pain
than
from
the
thought
that
five
companions
for
whom
he
may
have
felt
a
genuine
liking
had
for
no
reason
at
all
combined
to
hurt
and
humiliate
him
i
can
not
explain
my
cruelty
on
this
occasion
why
did
i
not
step
forward
to
comfort
and
protect
him
where
was
the
pitifulness
which
often
made
me
burst
into
tears
at
the
sight
of
a
young
bird
fallen
from
its
nest
or
of
a
puppy
being
thrown
over
a
wall
or
of
a
chicken
being
killed
by
the
cook
for
soup
can
it
be
that
the
better
instinct
in
me
was
overshadowed
by
my
affection
for
seriosha
and
the
desire
to
shine
before
so
brave
a
boy
if
so
how
contemptible
were
both
the
affection
and
the
desire
they
alone
form
dark
spots
on
the
pages
of
my
youthful
recollections
xx
preparations
for
the
party
to
judge
from
the
extraordinary
activity
in
the
pantry
the
shining
cleanliness
which
imparted
such
a
new
and
festal
guise
to
certain
articles
in
the
salon
and
which
i
had
long
known
as
anything
but
resplendent
and
the
arrival
of
some
musicians
whom
prince
ivan
would
certainly
not
have
sent
for
nothing
no
small
amount
of
company
was
to
be
expected
that
evening
at
the
sound
of
every
vehicle
which
chanced
to
pass
the
house
i
ran
to
the
window
leaned
my
head
upon
my
arms
and
peered
with
impatient
curiosity
into
the
street
at
last
a
carriage
stopped
at
our
door
and
in
the
full
belief
that
this
must
be
the
iwins
who
had
promised
to
come
early
i
at
once
ran
downstairs
to
meet
them
in
the
hall
but
instead
of
the
iwins
i
beheld
from
behind
the
figure
of
the
footman
who
opened
the
door
two
female
tall
and
wrapped
in
a
blue
cloak
trimmed
with
marten
and
the
other
one
short
and
wrapped
in
a
green
shawl
from
beneath
which
a
pair
of
little
feet
stuck
into
fur
boots
peeped
forth
without
paying
any
attention
to
my
presence
in
the
hall
although
i
thought
it
my
duty
on
the
appearance
of
these
persons
to
salute
them
the
shorter
one
moved
towards
the
taller
and
stood
silently
in
front
of
her
thereupon
the
tall
lady
untied
the
shawl
which
enveloped
the
head
of
the
little
one
and
unbuttoned
the
cloak
which
hid
her
form
until
by
the
time
that
the
footmen
had
taken
charge
of
these
articles
and
removed
the
fur
boots
there
stood
forth
from
the
amorphous
chrysalis
a
charming
girl
of
twelve
dressed
in
a
short
muslin
frock
white
pantaloons
and
smart
black
satin
shoes
around
her
white
neck
she
wore
a
narrow
black
velvet
ribbon
while
her
head
was
covered
with
flaxen
curls
which
so
perfectly
suited
her
beautiful
face
in
front
and
her
bare
neck
and
shoulders
behind
that
i
would
have
believed
nobody
not
even
karl
ivanitch
if
he
or
she
had
told
me
that
they
only
hung
so
nicely
because
ever
since
the
morning
they
had
been
screwed
up
in
fragments
of
a
moscow
newspaper
and
then
warmed
with
a
hot
iron
to
me
it
seemed
as
though
she
must
have
been
born
with
those
curls
the
most
prominent
feature
in
her
face
was
a
pair
of
unusually
large
eyes
which
formed
a
strange
but
pleasing
contrast
to
the
small
mouth
her
lips
were
closed
while
her
eyes
looked
so
grave
that
the
general
expression
of
her
face
gave
one
the
impression
that
a
smile
was
never
to
be
looked
for
from
her
wherefore
when
a
smile
did
come
it
was
all
the
more
pleasing
trying
to
escape
notice
i
slipped
through
the
door
of
the
salon
and
then
thought
it
necessary
to
be
seen
pacing
to
and
fro
seemingly
engaged
in
thought
as
though
unconscious
of
the
arrival
of
guests
by
the
time
however
that
the
ladies
had
advanced
to
the
middle
of
the
salon
i
seemed
suddenly
to
awake
from
my
reverie
and
told
them
that
grandmamma
was
in
the
drawing
room
madame
valakhin
whose
face
pleased
me
extremely
especially
since
it
bore
a
great
resemblance
to
her
daughter
s
stroked
my
head
kindly
grandmamma
seemed
delighted
to
see
sonetchka
she
invited
her
to
come
to
her
put
back
a
curl
which
had
fallen
over
her
brow
and
looking
earnestly
at
her
said
what
a
charming
child
sonetchka
blushed
smiled
and
indeed
looked
so
charming
that
i
myself
blushed
as
i
looked
at
her
i
hope
you
are
going
to
enjoy
yourself
here
my
love
said
grandmamma
pray
be
as
merry
and
dance
as
much
as
ever
you
can
see
we
have
two
beaux
for
her
already
she
added
turning
to
madame
valakhin
and
stretching
out
her
hand
to
me
this
coupling
of
sonetchka
and
myself
pleased
me
so
much
that
i
blushed
again
feeling
presently
that
my
embarrassment
was
increasing
and
hearing
the
sound
of
carriages
approaching
i
thought
it
wise
to
retire
in
the
hall
i
encountered
the
princess
kornakoff
her
son
and
an
incredible
number
of
daughters
they
had
all
of
them
the
same
face
as
their
mother
and
were
very
ugly
none
of
them
arrested
my
attention
they
talked
in
shrill
tones
as
they
took
off
their
cloaks
and
boas
and
laughed
as
they
bustled
about
probably
at
the
fact
that
there
were
so
many
of
them
etienne
was
a
boy
of
fifteen
tall
and
plump
with
a
sharp
face
bluish
eyes
and
very
large
hands
and
feet
for
his
age
likewise
he
was
awkward
and
had
a
nervous
unpleasing
voice
nevertheless
he
seemed
very
pleased
with
himself
and
was
in
my
opinion
a
boy
who
could
well
bear
being
beaten
with
rods
for
a
long
time
we
confronted
one
another
without
speaking
as
we
took
stock
of
each
other
when
the
flood
of
dresses
had
swept
past
i
made
shift
to
begin
a
conversation
by
asking
him
whether
it
had
not
been
very
close
in
the
carriage
i
don
t
know
he
answered
indifferently
i
never
ride
inside
it
for
it
makes
me
feel
sick
directly
and
mamma
knows
that
whenever
we
are
driving
anywhere
at
i
always
sit
on
the
box
i
like
that
for
then
one
sees
everything
philip
gives
me
the
reins
and
sometimes
the
whip
too
and
then
the
people
inside
get
a
regular
well
you
know
he
added
with
a
significant
gesture
it
s
splendid
master
etienne
said
a
footman
entering
the
hall
philip
wishes
me
to
ask
you
where
you
put
the
where
i
put
it
why
i
gave
it
back
to
but
he
says
that
you
did
well
i
laid
it
across
the
no
sir
he
says
that
you
did
not
do
that
either
you
had
better
confess
that
you
took
it
and
lashed
it
to
shreds
i
suppose
poor
philip
will
have
to
make
good
your
mischief
out
of
his
own
the
footman
who
looked
a
grave
and
honest
man
seemed
much
put
out
by
the
affair
and
determined
to
sift
it
to
the
bottom
on
philip
s
behalf
out
of
delicacy
i
pretended
to
notice
nothing
and
turned
aside
but
the
other
footmen
present
gathered
round
and
looked
approvingly
at
the
old
servant
hm
well
i
did
tear
it
in
pieces
at
length
confessed
etienne
shrinking
from
further
explanations
however
i
will
pay
for
it
did
you
ever
hear
anything
so
absurd
he
added
to
me
as
he
drew
me
towards
the
but
excuse
me
sir
how
are
you
going
to
pay
for
it
i
know
your
ways
of
paying
you
have
owed
maria
valericana
twenty
copecks
these
eight
months
now
and
you
have
owed
me
something
for
two
years
and
peter
for
hold
your
tongue
will
you
shouted
the
young
fellow
pale
with
rage
i
shall
report
you
for
oh
you
may
do
so
said
the
footman
yet
it
is
not
fair
your
highness
he
added
with
a
peculiar
stress
on
the
title
as
he
departed
with
the
ladies
wraps
to
the
we
ourselves
entered
the
salon
quite
right
footman
remarked
someone
approvingly
from
the
ball
behind
us
grandmamma
had
a
peculiar
way
of
employing
now
the
second
person
singular
now
the
second
person
plural
in
order
to
indicate
her
opinion
of
people
when
the
young
prince
etienne
went
up
to
her
she
addressed
him
as
you
and
altogether
looked
at
him
with
such
an
expression
of
contempt
that
had
i
been
in
his
place
i
should
have
been
utterly
crestfallen
etienne
however
was
evidently
not
a
boy
of
that
sort
for
he
not
only
took
no
notice
of
her
reception
of
him
but
none
of
her
person
either
in
fact
he
bowed
to
the
company
at
large
in
a
way
which
though
not
graceful
was
at
least
free
from
embarrassment
sonetchka
now
claimed
my
whole
attention
i
remember
that
as
i
stood
in
the
salon
with
etienne
and
woloda
at
a
spot
whence
we
could
both
see
and
be
seen
by
sonetchka
i
took
great
pleasure
in
talking
very
loud
and
all
my
utterances
seemed
to
me
both
bold
and
comical
and
glancing
towards
the
door
of
the
but
that
as
soon
as
ever
we
happened
to
move
to
another
spot
whence
we
could
neither
see
nor
be
seen
by
her
i
became
dumb
and
thought
the
conversation
had
ceased
to
be
enjoyable
the
rooms
were
now
full
of
people
among
them
as
at
all
children
s
parties
a
number
of
elder
children
who
wished
to
dance
and
enjoy
themselves
very
much
but
who
pretended
to
do
everything
merely
in
order
to
give
pleasure
to
the
mistress
of
the
house
when
the
iwins
arrived
i
found
that
instead
of
being
as
delighted
as
usual
to
meet
seriosha
i
felt
a
kind
of
vexation
that
he
should
see
and
be
seen
by
sonetchka
xxi
before
the
mazurka
hullo
woloda
so
we
are
going
to
dance
said
seriosha
issuing
from
the
and
taking
out
of
his
pocket
a
brand
new
pair
of
gloves
i
suppose
it
is
necessary
to
put
on
gloves
goodness
what
shall
i
do
we
have
no
gloves
i
thought
to
myself
i
must
go
upstairs
and
search
yet
though
i
rummaged
in
every
drawer
i
only
found
in
one
of
them
my
green
travelling
mittens
and
in
another
a
single
glove
a
thing
which
could
be
of
no
use
to
me
firstly
because
it
was
very
old
and
dirty
secondly
because
it
was
much
too
large
for
me
and
thirdly
and
principally
because
the
middle
finger
was
wanting
karl
having
long
ago
cut
it
off
to
wear
over
a
sore
nail
however
i
put
it
on
not
without
some
diffident
contemplation
of
the
blank
left
by
the
middle
finger
and
of
the
edges
round
the
vacant
space
if
only
natalia
savishna
had
been
here
i
reflected
we
should
certainly
have
found
some
gloves
i
can
t
go
downstairs
in
this
condition
yet
if
they
ask
me
why
i
am
not
dancing
what
am
i
to
say
however
i
can
t
remain
here
either
or
they
will
be
sending
upstairs
to
fetch
me
what
on
earth
am
i
to
do
and
i
wrung
my
hands
what
are
you
up
to
here
asked
woloda
as
he
burst
into
the
room
go
and
engage
a
partner
the
dancing
will
be
beginning
woloda
i
said
despairingly
as
i
showed
him
my
hand
with
two
fingers
thrust
into
a
single
finger
of
the
dirty
glove
woloda
you
never
thought
of
of
what
he
said
impatiently
oh
of
gloves
he
added
with
a
careless
glance
at
my
hand
that
s
nothing
we
can
ask
grandmamma
what
she
thinks
about
it
and
without
further
ado
he
departed
downstairs
i
felt
a
trifle
relieved
by
the
coolness
with
which
he
had
met
a
situation
which
seemed
to
me
so
grave
and
hastened
back
to
the
completely
forgetful
of
the
unfortunate
glove
which
still
adorned
my
left
hand
cautiously
approaching
grandmamma
s
i
asked
her
in
a
whisper
grandmamma
what
are
we
to
do
we
have
no
what
my
love
we
have
no
gloves
i
repeated
at
the
same
time
bending
over
towards
her
and
laying
both
hands
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
but
what
is
that
she
cried
as
she
caught
hold
of
my
left
hand
look
my
dear
she
continued
turning
to
madame
valakhin
see
how
smart
this
young
man
has
made
himself
to
dance
with
your
daughter
as
grandmamma
persisted
in
retaining
hold
of
my
hand
and
gazing
with
a
mock
air
of
gravity
and
interrogation
at
all
around
her
curiosity
was
soon
aroused
and
a
general
roar
of
laughter
ensued
i
should
have
been
infuriated
at
the
thought
that
seriosha
was
present
to
see
this
as
i
scowled
with
embarrassment
and
struggled
hard
to
free
my
hand
had
it
not
been
that
somehow
sonetchka
s
laughter
and
she
was
laughing
to
such
a
degree
that
the
tears
were
standing
in
her
eyes
and
the
curls
dancing
about
her
lovely
face
took
away
my
feeling
of
humiliation
i
felt
that
her
laughter
was
not
satirical
but
only
natural
and
free
so
that
as
we
laughed
together
and
looked
at
one
another
there
seemed
to
begin
a
kind
of
sympathy
between
us
instead
of
turning
out
badly
therefore
the
episode
of
the
glove
served
only
to
set
me
at
my
ease
among
the
dreaded
circle
of
guests
and
to
make
me
cease
to
feel
oppressed
with
shyness
the
sufferings
of
shy
people
proceed
only
from
the
doubts
which
they
feel
concerning
the
opinions
of
their
fellows
no
sooner
are
those
opinions
expressed
whether
flattering
or
the
reverse
than
the
agony
disappears
how
lovely
sonetchka
looked
when
she
was
dancing
a
quadrille
as
my
with
as
her
partner
the
loutish
prince
etienne
how
charmingly
she
smiled
when
en
chaine
she
accorded
me
her
hand
how
gracefully
the
curls
around
her
head
nodded
to
the
rhythm
and
how
naively
she
executed
the
jete
assemble
with
her
little
feet
in
the
fifth
figure
when
my
partner
had
to
leave
me
for
the
other
side
and
i
counting
the
beats
was
getting
ready
to
dance
my
solo
she
pursed
her
lips
gravely
and
looked
in
another
direction
but
her
fears
for
me
were
groundless
boldly
i
performed
the
chasse
en
avant
and
chasse
en
arriere
glissade
until
when
it
came
to
my
turn
to
move
towards
her
and
i
with
a
comic
gesture
showed
her
the
poor
glove
with
its
crumpled
fingers
she
laughed
heartily
and
seemed
to
move
her
tiny
feet
more
enchantingly
than
ever
over
the
parquetted
floor
how
well
i
remember
how
we
formed
the
circle
and
how
without
withdrawing
her
hand
from
mine
she
scratched
her
little
nose
with
her
glove
all
this
i
can
see
before
me
still
still
can
i
hear
the
quadrille
from
the
maids
of
the
danube
to
which
we
danced
that
night
the
second
quadrille
i
danced
with
sonetchka
herself
yet
when
we
went
to
sit
down
together
during
the
interval
i
felt
overcome
with
shyness
and
as
though
i
had
nothing
to
say
at
last
when
my
silence
had
lasted
so
long
that
i
began
to
be
afraid
that
she
would
think
me
a
stupid
boy
i
decided
at
all
hazards
to
counteract
such
a
notion
vous
etes
une
habitante
de
moscou
i
began
and
on
receiving
an
affirmative
answer
continued
et
moi
je
n
ai
encore
jamais
frequente
la
capitale
with
a
particular
emphasis
on
the
word
frequente
yet
i
felt
that
brilliant
though
this
introduction
might
be
as
evidence
of
my
profound
knowledge
of
the
french
language
i
could
not
long
keep
up
the
conversation
in
that
manner
our
turn
for
dancing
had
not
yet
arrived
and
silence
again
ensued
between
us
i
kept
looking
anxiously
at
her
in
the
hope
both
of
discerning
what
impression
i
had
produced
and
of
her
coming
to
my
aid
where
did
you
get
that
ridiculous
glove
of
yours
she
asked
me
all
of
a
sudden
and
the
question
afforded
me
immense
satisfaction
and
relief
i
replied
that
the
glove
belonged
to
karl
ivanitch
and
then
went
on
to
speak
ironically
of
his
appearance
and
to
describe
how
comical
he
looked
in
his
red
cap
and
how
he
and
his
green
coat
had
once
fallen
plump
off
a
horse
into
a
pond
the
quadrille
was
soon
over
yet
why
had
i
spoken
ironically
of
poor
karl
ivanitch
should
i
forsooth
have
sunk
in
sonetchka
s
esteem
if
on
the
contrary
i
had
spoken
of
him
with
the
love
and
respect
which
i
undoubtedly
bore
him
the
quadrille
ended
sonetchka
said
thank
you
with
as
lovely
an
expression
on
her
face
as
though
i
had
really
conferred
upon
her
a
favour
i
was
delighted
in
fact
i
hardly
knew
myself
for
joy
and
could
not
think
whence
i
derived
such
case
and
confidence
and
even
daring
nothing
in
the
world
can
abash
me
now
i
thought
as
i
wandered
carelessly
about
the
salon
i
am
ready
for
just
then
seriosha
came
and
requested
me
to
be
his
very
well
i
said
i
have
no
partner
as
yet
but
i
can
soon
find
glancing
round
the
salon
with
a
confident
eye
i
saw
that
every
lady
was
engaged
save
one
a
tall
girl
standing
near
the
door
yet
a
young
man
was
approaching
for
the
same
purpose
as
myself
he
was
but
two
steps
from
her
while
i
was
at
the
further
end
of
the
salon
doing
a
glissade
over
the
polished
floor
i
covered
the
intervening
space
and
in
a
brave
firm
voice
asked
the
favour
of
her
hand
in
the
quadrille
smiling
with
a
protecting
air
the
young
lady
accorded
me
her
hand
and
the
tall
young
man
was
left
without
a
partner
i
felt
so
conscious
of
my
strength
that
i
paid
no
attention
to
his
irritation
though
i
learnt
later
that
he
had
asked
somebody
who
the
awkward
untidy
boy
was
who
had
taken
away
his
lady
from
him
xxii
the
mazurka
afterwards
the
same
young
man
formed
one
of
the
first
couple
in
a
mazurka
he
sprang
to
his
feet
took
his
partner
s
hand
and
then
instead
of
executing
the
pas
de
basques
which
mimi
had
taught
us
glided
forward
till
he
arrived
at
a
corner
of
the
room
stopped
divided
his
feet
turned
on
his
heels
and
with
a
spring
glided
back
again
i
who
had
found
no
partner
for
this
particular
dance
and
was
sitting
on
the
arm
of
grandmamma
s
chair
thought
to
myself
what
on
earth
is
he
doing
that
is
not
what
mimi
taught
us
and
there
are
the
iwins
and
etienne
all
dancing
in
the
same
the
pas
de
basques
ah
and
there
is
woloda
too
he
too
is
adopting
the
new
style
and
not
so
badly
either
and
there
is
sonetchka
the
lovely
one
yes
there
she
comes
i
felt
immensely
happy
at
that
moment
the
mazurka
came
to
an
end
and
already
some
of
the
guests
were
saying
to
grandmamma
she
was
evidently
tired
yet
she
assured
them
that
she
felt
vexed
at
their
early
departure
servants
were
gliding
about
with
plates
and
trays
among
the
dancers
and
the
musicians
were
carelessly
playing
the
same
tune
for
about
the
thirteenth
time
in
succession
when
the
young
lady
whom
i
had
danced
with
before
and
who
was
just
about
to
join
in
another
mazurka
caught
sight
of
me
and
with
a
kindly
smile
led
me
to
sonetchka
and
one
of
the
innumerable
kornakoff
princesses
at
the
same
time
asking
me
rose
or
hortie
ah
so
it
s
you
said
grandmamma
as
she
turned
round
in
her
armchair
go
and
dance
then
my
although
i
would
fain
have
taken
refuge
behind
the
armchair
rather
than
leave
its
shelter
i
could
not
refuse
so
i
got
up
said
rose
and
looked
at
sonetchka
before
i
had
time
to
realise
it
however
a
hand
in
a
white
glove
laid
itself
on
mine
and
the
kornakoff
girl
stepped
forth
with
a
pleased
smile
and
evidently
no
suspicion
that
i
was
ignorant
of
the
steps
of
the
dance
i
only
knew
that
the
pas
de
basques
the
only
figure
of
it
which
i
had
been
taught
would
be
out
of
place
however
the
strains
of
the
mazurka
falling
upon
my
ears
and
imparting
their
usual
impulse
to
my
acoustic
nerves
which
in
their
turn
imparted
their
usual
impulse
to
my
feet
i
involuntarily
and
to
the
amazement
of
the
spectators
began
executing
on
tiptoe
the
sole
and
fatal
pas
which
i
had
been
taught
so
long
as
we
went
straight
ahead
i
kept
fairly
right
but
when
it
came
to
turning
i
saw
that
i
must
make
preparations
to
arrest
my
course
accordingly
to
avoid
any
appearance
of
awkwardness
i
stopped
short
with
the
intention
of
imitating
the
wheel
about
which
i
had
seen
the
young
man
perform
so
neatly
unfortunately
just
as
i
divided
my
feet
and
prepared
to
make
a
spring
the
princess
kornakoff
looked
sharply
round
at
my
legs
with
such
an
expression
of
stupefied
amazement
and
curiosity
that
the
glance
undid
me
instead
of
continuing
to
dance
i
remained
moving
my
legs
up
and
down
on
the
same
spot
in
a
sort
of
extraordinary
fashion
which
bore
no
relation
whatever
either
to
form
or
rhythm
at
last
i
stopped
altogether
was
looking
at
me
some
with
curiosity
some
with
astonishment
some
with
disdain
and
some
with
compassion
grandmamma
alone
seemed
unmoved
you
should
not
dance
if
you
don
t
know
the
step
said
papa
s
angry
voice
in
my
ear
as
pushing
me
gently
aside
he
took
my
partner
s
hand
completed
the
figures
with
her
to
the
admiration
of
every
one
and
finally
led
her
back
to
her
place
the
mazurka
was
at
an
end
ah
me
what
had
i
done
to
be
punished
so
heavily
every
one
despises
me
and
will
always
despise
me
i
thought
to
myself
the
way
is
closed
for
me
to
friendship
love
and
fame
all
all
is
lost
why
had
woloda
made
signs
to
me
which
every
one
saw
yet
which
could
in
no
way
help
me
why
had
that
disgusting
princess
looked
at
my
legs
why
had
sonetchka
she
was
a
darling
of
course
yet
why
oh
why
had
she
smiled
at
that
moment
why
had
papa
turned
red
and
taken
my
hand
can
it
be
that
he
was
ashamed
of
me
oh
it
was
dreadful
alas
if
only
mamma
had
been
there
she
would
never
have
blushed
for
her
nicolinka
how
on
the
instant
that
dear
image
led
my
imagination
captive
i
seemed
to
see
once
more
the
meadow
before
our
house
the
tall
in
the
garden
the
clear
pond
where
the
ducks
swain
the
blue
sky
dappled
with
white
clouds
the
ricks
of
hay
how
those
memories
aye
and
many
another
quiet
beloved
recollection
floated
through
my
mind
at
that
time
xxiii
after
the
mazurka
at
supper
the
young
man
whom
i
have
mentioned
seated
himself
beside
me
at
the
children
s
table
and
treated
me
with
an
amount
of
attention
which
would
have
flattered
my
had
i
been
able
after
the
occurrence
just
related
to
give
a
thought
to
anything
beyond
my
failure
in
the
mazurka
however
the
young
man
seemed
determined
to
cheer
me
up
he
jested
called
me
old
boy
and
finally
since
none
of
the
elder
folks
were
looking
at
us
began
to
help
me
to
wine
first
from
one
bottle
and
then
from
another
and
to
force
me
to
drink
it
off
quickly
by
the
time
towards
the
end
of
supper
that
a
servant
had
poured
me
out
a
quarter
of
a
glass
of
champagne
and
the
young
man
had
straightway
bid
him
fill
it
up
and
urged
me
to
drink
the
beverage
off
at
a
draught
i
had
begun
to
feel
a
grateful
warmth
diffusing
itself
through
my
body
i
also
felt
towards
my
kind
patron
and
began
to
laugh
heartily
at
everything
suddenly
the
music
of
the
grosvater
dance
struck
up
and
every
one
rushed
from
the
table
my
friendship
with
the
young
man
had
now
outlived
its
day
so
whereas
he
joined
a
group
of
the
older
folks
i
approached
madame
valakhin
to
hear
what
she
and
her
daughter
had
to
say
to
one
another
just
more
sonetchka
was
imploring
her
impossible
my
yet
only
to
please
me
just
this
once
sonetchka
went
on
persuasively
well
what
if
i
should
be
ill
through
all
this
dissipation
rejoined
her
mother
and
was
incautious
enough
to
smile
there
you
do
consent
and
we
can
stay
after
all
exclaimed
sonetchka
jumping
for
joy
what
is
to
be
done
with
such
a
girl
said
madame
well
run
away
and
dance
see
she
added
on
perceiving
myself
here
is
a
cavalier
ready
waiting
for
sonetchka
gave
me
her
hand
and
we
darted
off
to
the
salon
the
wine
added
to
sonetchka
s
presence
and
gaiety
had
at
once
made
me
forget
all
about
the
unfortunate
end
of
the
mazurka
i
kept
executing
the
most
splendid
feats
with
my
legs
now
imitating
a
horse
as
he
throws
out
his
hoofs
in
the
trot
now
stamping
like
a
sheep
infuriated
at
a
dog
and
all
the
while
laughing
regardless
of
appearances
sonetchka
also
laughed
unceasingly
whether
we
were
whirling
round
in
a
circle
or
whether
we
stood
still
to
watch
an
old
lady
whose
painful
movements
with
her
feet
showed
the
difficulty
she
had
in
walking
finally
sonetchka
nearly
died
of
merriment
when
i
jumped
to
the
ceiling
in
proof
of
my
skill
as
i
passed
a
mirror
in
grandmamma
s
boudoir
and
glanced
at
myself
i
could
see
that
my
face
was
all
in
a
perspiration
and
my
hair
dishevelled
the
in
particular
being
more
erect
than
ever
yet
my
general
appearance
looked
so
happy
healthy
and
that
i
felt
wholly
pleased
with
myself
if
i
were
always
as
i
am
now
i
thought
i
might
yet
be
able
to
please
people
with
my
yet
as
soon
as
i
glanced
at
my
partner
s
face
again
and
saw
there
not
only
the
expression
of
happiness
health
and
good
temper
which
had
just
pleased
me
in
my
own
but
also
a
fresh
and
enchanting
beauty
besides
i
felt
dissatisfied
with
myself
again
i
understood
how
silly
of
me
it
was
to
hope
to
attract
the
attention
of
such
a
wonderful
being
as
sonetchka
i
could
not
hope
for
reciprocity
could
not
even
think
of
it
yet
my
heart
was
overflowing
with
happiness
i
could
not
imagine
that
the
feeling
of
love
which
was
filling
my
soul
so
pleasantly
could
require
any
happiness
still
greater
or
wish
for
more
than
that
that
happiness
should
never
cease
i
felt
perfectly
contented
my
heart
beat
like
that
of
a
dove
with
the
blood
constantly
flowing
back
to
it
and
i
almost
wept
for
joy
as
we
passed
through
the
hall
and
peered
into
a
little
dark
beneath
the
staircase
i
thought
what
bliss
it
would
be
if
i
could
pass
the
rest
of
my
life
with
her
in
that
dark
corner
and
never
let
anybody
know
that
we
were
there
it
has
been
a
delightful
evening
hasn
t
it
i
asked
her
in
a
low
tremulous
voice
then
i
quickened
my
steps
as
much
out
of
fear
of
what
i
had
said
as
out
of
fear
of
what
i
had
meant
to
imply
yes
very
she
answered
and
turned
her
face
to
look
at
me
with
an
expression
so
kind
that
i
ceased
to
be
afraid
i
went
on
particularly
since
supper
yet
if
you
could
only
know
how
i
regret
i
had
nearly
said
how
miserable
i
am
at
your
going
and
to
think
that
we
shall
see
each
other
no
more
but
why
shouldn
t
we
she
asked
looking
gravely
at
the
corner
of
her
and
gliding
her
fingers
over
a
latticed
screen
which
we
were
passing
every
tuesday
and
friday
i
go
with
mamma
to
the
iverskoi
prospect
i
suppose
you
go
for
walks
too
sometimes
well
certainly
i
shall
ask
to
go
for
one
next
tuesday
and
if
they
won
t
take
me
i
shall
go
by
myself
even
without
my
hat
if
necessary
i
know
the
way
all
do
you
know
what
i
have
just
thought
of
she
went
on
you
know
i
call
some
of
the
boys
who
come
to
see
us
thou
shall
you
and
i
call
each
other
thou
too
wilt
thou
she
added
bending
her
head
towards
me
and
looking
me
straight
in
the
eyes
at
this
moment
a
more
lively
section
of
the
grosvater
dance
began
give
me
your
hand
i
said
under
the
impression
that
the
music
and
din
would
drown
my
exact
words
but
she
smilingly
replied
thy
hand
not
your
yet
the
dance
was
over
before
i
had
succeeded
in
saying
thou
even
though
i
kept
conning
over
phrases
in
which
the
pronoun
could
be
employed
and
employed
more
than
once
all
that
i
wanted
was
the
courage
to
say
it
wilt
thou
and
thy
hand
sounded
continually
in
my
ears
and
caused
in
me
a
kind
of
intoxication
i
could
hear
and
see
nothing
but
sonetchka
i
watched
her
mother
take
her
curls
lay
them
flat
behind
her
ears
thus
disclosing
portions
of
her
forehead
and
temples
which
i
had
not
yet
seen
and
wrap
her
up
so
completely
in
the
green
shawl
that
nothing
was
left
visible
but
the
tip
of
her
nose
indeed
i
could
see
that
if
her
little
rosy
fingers
had
not
made
a
small
opening
near
her
mouth
she
would
have
been
unable
to
breathe
finally
i
saw
her
leave
her
mother
s
arm
for
an
instant
on
the
staircase
and
turn
and
nod
to
us
quickly
before
she
disappeared
through
the
doorway
woloda
the
iwins
the
young
prince
etienne
and
myself
were
all
of
us
in
love
with
sonetchka
and
all
of
us
standing
on
the
staircase
to
follow
her
with
our
eyes
to
whom
in
particular
she
had
nodded
i
do
not
know
but
at
the
moment
i
firmly
believed
it
to
be
myself
in
taking
leave
of
the
iwins
i
spoke
quite
unconcernedly
and
even
coldly
to
seriosha
before
i
finally
shook
hands
with
him
though
he
tried
to
appear
absolutely
indifferent
i
think
that
he
understood
that
from
that
day
forth
he
had
lost
both
my
affection
and
his
power
over
me
as
well
as
that
he
regretted
it
xxiv
in
bed
how
could
i
have
managed
to
be
so
long
and
so
passionately
devoted
to
seriosha
i
asked
myself
as
i
lay
in
bed
that
night
he
never
either
understood
appreciated
or
deserved
my
love
but
sonetchka
what
a
darling
she
is
wilt
thou
thy
hand
i
crept
closer
to
the
pillows
imagined
to
myself
her
lovely
face
covered
my
head
over
with
the
bedclothes
tucked
the
counterpane
in
on
all
sides
and
thus
snugly
covered
lay
quiet
and
enjoying
the
warmth
until
i
became
wholly
absorbed
in
pleasant
fancies
and
reminiscences
if
i
stared
fixedly
at
the
inside
of
the
sheet
above
me
i
found
that
i
could
see
her
as
clearly
as
i
had
done
an
hour
ago
could
talk
to
her
in
my
thoughts
and
though
it
was
a
conversation
of
irrational
tenor
i
derived
the
greatest
delight
from
it
seeing
that
thou
and
thine
and
for
thee
and
to
thee
occurred
in
it
incessantly
these
fancies
were
so
vivid
that
i
could
not
sleep
for
the
sweetness
of
my
emotion
and
felt
as
though
i
must
communicate
my
superabundant
happiness
to
some
one
the
darling
i
said
as
i
turned
over
then
woloda
are
you
asleep
no
he
replied
in
a
sleepy
voice
what
s
the
matter
i
am
in
love
woloda
terribly
in
love
with
sonetchka
well
anything
else
he
replied
stretching
himself
oh
but
you
can
not
imagine
what
i
feel
just
now
as
i
lay
covered
over
with
the
counterpane
i
could
see
her
and
talk
to
her
so
clearly
that
it
was
marvellous
and
do
you
know
while
i
was
lying
thinking
about
her
i
don
t
know
why
it
was
but
all
at
once
i
felt
so
sad
that
i
could
have
woloda
made
a
movement
of
some
sort
one
thing
only
i
wish
for
i
continued
and
that
is
that
i
could
always
be
with
her
and
always
be
seeing
her
just
that
you
are
in
love
too
i
believe
confess
that
you
it
was
strange
but
somehow
i
wanted
every
one
to
be
in
love
with
sonetchka
and
every
one
to
tell
me
that
they
were
so
so
that
s
how
it
is
with
you
said
woloda
turning
round
to
me
well
i
can
understand
i
can
see
that
you
can
not
sleep
i
remarked
observing
by
his
bright
eyes
that
he
was
anything
but
drowsy
well
cover
yourself
over
so
and
i
pulled
the
bedclothes
over
him
and
then
let
us
talk
about
her
isn
t
she
splendid
if
she
were
to
say
to
me
nicolinka
jump
out
of
the
window
or
jump
into
the
fire
i
should
say
yes
i
will
do
it
at
once
and
rejoice
in
doing
oh
how
glorious
she
is
i
went
on
picturing
her
again
and
again
to
my
imagination
and
to
enjoy
the
vision
the
better
turned
over
on
my
side
and
buried
my
head
in
the
pillows
murmuring
oh
i
want
to
cry
what
a
fool
you
are
he
said
with
a
slight
laugh
then
after
a
moment
s
silence
he
added
i
am
not
like
you
i
think
i
would
rather
sit
and
talk
with
ah
then
you
are
in
love
with
her
i
interrupted
and
then
went
on
woloda
smiling
tenderly
kiss
her
fingers
and
eyes
and
lips
and
nose
and
feet
kiss
all
of
how
absurd
i
exclaimed
from
beneath
the
pillows
ah
you
don
t
understand
things
said
woloda
with
contempt
i
do
understand
it
s
you
who
don
t
understand
things
and
you
talk
rubbish
too
i
replied
well
there
is
nothing
to
cry
about
he
concluded
she
is
only
a
xxv
the
letter
on
the
of
april
nearly
six
months
after
the
day
just
described
papa
entered
our
schoolroom
and
told
us
that
that
night
we
must
start
with
him
for
our
country
house
i
felt
a
pang
at
my
heart
when
i
heard
the
news
and
my
thoughts
at
once
turned
to
mamma
the
cause
of
our
unexpected
departure
was
the
following
letter
petrovskoe
april
only
this
moment
at
ten
o
clock
in
the
evening
have
i
received
your
dear
letter
of
the
of
april
but
as
usual
i
answer
it
at
once
fedor
brought
it
yesterday
from
town
but
as
it
was
late
he
did
not
give
it
to
mimi
till
this
morning
and
mimi
since
i
was
unwell
kept
it
from
me
all
day
i
have
been
a
little
feverish
in
fact
to
tell
the
truth
this
is
the
fourth
day
that
i
have
been
in
bed
yet
do
not
be
uneasy
i
feel
almost
myself
again
now
and
if
ivan
vassilitch
should
allow
me
i
think
of
getting
up
on
friday
last
i
took
the
girls
for
a
drive
and
close
to
the
little
bridge
by
the
turning
on
to
the
high
road
the
place
which
always
makes
me
nervous
the
horses
and
carriage
stuck
fast
in
the
mud
well
the
day
being
fine
i
thought
that
we
would
walk
a
little
up
the
road
until
the
carriage
should
be
extricated
but
no
sooner
had
we
reached
the
chapel
than
i
felt
obliged
to
sit
down
i
was
so
tired
and
in
this
way
passed
while
help
was
being
sent
for
to
get
the
carriage
dug
out
i
felt
cold
for
i
had
only
thin
boots
on
and
they
had
been
wet
through
after
luncheon
too
i
had
alternate
cold
and
hot
fits
yet
still
continued
to
follow
our
ordinary
routine
when
tea
was
over
i
sat
down
to
the
piano
to
play
a
duct
with
lubotshka
you
would
be
astonished
to
hear
what
progress
she
has
made
but
imagine
my
surprise
when
i
found
that
i
could
not
count
the
beats
several
times
i
began
to
do
so
yet
always
felt
confused
in
my
head
and
kept
hearing
strange
noises
in
my
ears
i
would
begin
and
then
suddenly
go
on
and
so
on
as
though
i
were
talking
nonsense
and
could
not
help
it
at
last
mimi
came
to
my
assistance
and
forced
me
to
retire
to
bed
that
was
how
my
illness
began
and
it
was
all
through
my
own
fault
the
next
day
i
had
a
good
deal
of
fever
and
our
good
ivan
vassilitch
came
he
has
not
left
us
since
but
promises
soon
to
restore
me
to
the
world
what
a
wonderful
old
man
he
is
while
i
was
feverish
and
delirious
he
sat
the
whole
night
by
my
bedside
without
once
closing
his
eyes
and
at
this
moment
since
he
knows
i
am
busy
writing
he
is
with
the
girls
in
the
divannaia
and
i
can
hear
him
telling
them
german
stories
and
them
laughing
as
they
listen
to
him
la
belle
flamande
as
you
call
her
is
now
spending
her
second
week
here
as
my
guest
her
mother
having
gone
to
pay
a
visit
somewhere
and
she
is
most
attentive
and
attached
to
me
she
even
tells
me
her
secret
affairs
under
different
circumstances
her
beautiful
face
good
temper
and
youth
might
have
made
a
most
excellent
girl
of
her
but
in
the
society
in
which
according
to
her
own
account
she
moves
she
will
be
wasted
the
idea
has
more
than
once
occurred
to
me
that
had
i
not
had
so
many
children
of
my
own
it
would
have
been
a
deed
of
mercy
to
have
adopted
her
lubotshka
had
meant
to
write
to
you
herself
but
she
has
torn
up
three
sheets
of
paper
saying
i
know
what
a
quizzer
papa
always
is
if
he
were
to
find
a
single
fault
in
my
letter
he
would
show
it
to
katenka
is
as
charming
as
usual
and
mimi
too
is
good
but
tiresome
now
let
me
speak
of
more
serious
matters
you
write
to
me
that
your
affairs
are
not
going
well
this
winter
and
that
you
wish
to
break
into
the
revenues
of
chabarovska
it
seems
to
me
strange
that
you
should
think
it
necessary
to
ask
my
consent
surely
what
belongs
to
me
belongs
no
less
to
you
you
are
so
dear
that
for
fear
of
worrying
me
you
conceal
the
real
state
of
things
but
i
can
guess
that
you
have
lost
a
great
deal
at
cards
as
also
that
you
are
afraid
of
my
being
angry
at
that
yet
so
long
as
you
can
tide
over
this
crisis
i
shall
not
think
much
of
it
and
you
need
not
be
uneasy
i
have
grown
accustomed
to
no
longer
relying
so
far
as
the
children
are
concerned
upon
your
gains
at
play
nor
yet
excuse
me
for
saying
so
upon
your
income
therefore
your
losses
cause
me
as
little
anxiety
as
your
gains
give
me
pleasure
what
i
really
grieve
over
is
your
unhappy
passion
itself
for
gambling
a
passion
which
bereaves
me
of
part
of
your
tender
affection
and
obliges
me
to
tell
you
such
bitter
truths
as
god
knows
with
what
pain
i
am
now
telling
you
i
never
cease
to
beseech
him
that
he
may
preserve
us
not
from
poverty
for
what
is
poverty
but
from
the
terrible
juncture
which
would
arise
should
the
interests
of
the
children
which
i
am
called
upon
to
protect
ever
come
into
collision
with
our
own
hitherto
god
has
listened
to
my
prayers
you
have
never
yet
overstepped
the
limit
beyond
which
we
should
be
obliged
either
to
sacrifice
property
which
would
no
longer
belong
to
us
but
to
the
children
or
it
is
terrible
to
think
of
but
the
dreadful
misfortune
at
which
i
hint
is
forever
hanging
over
our
heads
yes
it
is
the
heavy
cross
which
god
has
given
us
both
to
carry
also
you
write
about
the
children
and
come
back
to
our
old
point
of
difference
by
asking
my
consent
to
your
placing
them
at
a
you
know
my
objection
to
that
kind
of
education
i
do
not
know
dear
whether
you
will
accede
to
my
request
but
i
nevertheless
beseech
you
by
your
love
for
me
to
give
me
your
promise
that
never
so
long
as
i
am
alive
nor
yet
after
my
death
if
god
should
see
fit
to
separate
us
shall
such
a
thing
be
done
also
you
write
that
our
affairs
render
it
indispensable
for
you
to
visit
petersburg
the
lord
go
with
you
go
and
return
as
soon
as
possible
without
you
we
shall
all
of
us
be
lonely
spring
is
coming
in
beautifully
we
keep
the
door
on
to
the
terrace
always
open
now
while
the
path
to
the
orangery
is
dry
and
the
are
in
full
blossom
only
here
and
there
is
there
a
little
snow
remaining
the
swallows
are
arriving
and
lubotshka
brought
me
the
first
flowers
the
doctor
says
that
in
about
three
days
time
i
shall
be
well
again
and
able
to
take
the
open
air
and
to
enjoy
the
april
sun
now
au
revoir
my
dearest
one
do
not
be
alarmed
i
beg
of
you
either
on
account
of
my
illness
or
on
account
of
your
losses
at
play
end
the
crisis
as
soon
as
possible
and
then
return
here
with
the
children
for
the
summer
i
am
making
wonderful
plans
for
our
passing
of
it
and
i
only
need
your
presence
to
realise
the
rest
of
the
letter
was
written
in
french
as
well
as
in
a
strange
uncertain
hand
on
another
piece
of
paper
i
transcribe
it
word
for
word
do
not
believe
what
i
have
just
written
to
you
about
my
illness
it
is
more
serious
than
any
one
knows
i
alone
know
that
i
shall
never
leave
my
bed
again
do
not
therefore
delay
a
minute
in
coming
here
with
the
children
perhaps
it
may
yet
be
permitted
me
to
embrace
and
bless
them
it
is
my
last
wish
that
it
should
be
so
i
know
what
a
terrible
blow
this
will
be
to
you
but
you
would
have
had
to
hear
it
sooner
or
later
if
not
from
me
at
least
from
others
let
us
try
to
bear
the
calamity
with
fortitude
and
place
our
trust
in
the
mercy
of
god
let
us
submit
ourselves
to
his
will
do
not
think
that
what
i
am
writing
is
some
delusion
of
my
sick
imagination
on
the
contrary
i
am
perfectly
clear
at
this
moment
and
absolutely
calm
nor
must
you
comfort
yourself
with
the
false
hope
that
these
are
the
unreal
confused
feelings
of
a
despondent
spirit
for
i
feel
indeed
i
know
since
god
has
deigned
to
reveal
it
to
me
that
i
have
now
but
a
very
short
time
to
live
will
my
love
for
you
and
the
children
cease
with
my
life
i
know
that
that
can
never
be
at
this
moment
i
am
too
full
of
that
love
to
be
capable
of
believing
that
such
a
feeling
which
constitutes
a
part
of
my
very
existence
can
ever
perish
my
soul
can
never
lack
its
love
for
you
and
i
know
that
that
love
will
exist
for
ever
since
such
a
feeling
could
never
have
been
awakened
if
it
were
not
to
be
eternal
i
shall
no
longer
be
with
you
yet
i
firmly
believe
that
my
love
will
cleave
to
you
always
and
from
that
thought
i
glean
such
comfort
that
i
await
the
approach
of
death
calmly
and
without
fear
yes
i
am
calm
and
god
knows
that
i
have
ever
looked
and
do
look
now
upon
death
as
no
more
than
the
passage
to
a
better
life
yet
why
do
tears
blind
my
eyes
why
should
the
children
lose
a
mother
s
love
why
must
you
my
husband
experience
such
a
heavy
and
blow
why
must
i
die
when
your
love
was
making
life
so
inexpressibly
happy
for
me
but
his
holy
will
be
done
the
tears
prevent
my
writing
more
it
may
be
that
i
shall
never
see
you
again
i
thank
you
my
darling
beyond
all
price
for
all
the
felicity
with
which
you
have
surrounded
me
in
this
life
soon
i
shall
appear
before
god
himself
to
pray
that
he
may
reward
you
farewell
my
dearest
remember
that
if
i
am
no
longer
here
my
love
will
none
the
less
never
and
nowhere
fail
you
farewell
woloda
farewell
my
pet
farewell
my
benjamin
my
little
nicolinka
surely
they
will
never
forget
me
with
this
letter
had
come
also
a
french
note
from
mimi
in
which
the
latter
said
the
sad
circumstances
of
which
she
has
written
to
you
are
but
too
surely
confirmed
by
the
words
of
the
doctor
yesterday
evening
she
ordered
the
letter
to
be
posted
at
once
but
thinking
at
she
did
so
in
delirium
i
waited
until
this
morning
with
the
intention
of
sealing
and
sending
it
then
hardly
had
i
done
so
when
natalia
nicolaevna
asked
me
what
i
had
done
with
the
letter
and
told
me
to
burn
it
if
not
yet
despatched
she
is
forever
speaking
of
it
and
saying
that
it
will
kill
you
do
not
delay
your
departure
for
an
instant
if
you
wish
to
see
the
angel
before
she
leaves
us
pray
excuse
this
scribble
but
i
have
not
slept
now
for
three
nights
you
know
how
much
i
love
later
i
heard
from
natalia
savishna
who
passed
the
whole
of
the
night
of
the
april
at
mamma
s
bedside
that
after
writing
the
first
part
of
the
letter
mamma
laid
it
down
upon
the
table
beside
her
and
went
to
sleep
for
a
while
i
confess
said
natalia
savishna
that
i
too
fell
asleep
in
the
and
let
my
knitting
slip
from
my
hands
suddenly
towards
one
o
clock
in
the
morning
i
heard
her
saying
something
whereupon
i
opened
my
eyes
and
looked
at
her
my
darling
was
sitting
up
in
bed
with
her
hands
clasped
together
and
streams
of
tears
gushing
from
her
eyes
it
is
all
over
now
she
said
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
i
sprang
to
my
feet
and
asked
what
the
matter
was
ah
natalia
savishna
if
you
could
only
know
what
i
have
just
seen
she
said
yet
for
all
my
asking
she
would
say
no
more
beyond
commanding
me
to
hand
her
the
letter
to
that
letter
she
added
something
and
then
said
that
it
must
be
sent
off
directly
from
that
moment
she
grew
rapidly
xxvi
what
awaited
us
at
the
on
the
of
april
we
descended
from
the
carriage
at
the
front
door
of
the
house
at
petrovskoe
all
the
way
from
moscow
papa
had
been
preoccupied
and
when
woloda
had
asked
him
whether
mamma
was
ill
he
had
looked
at
him
sadly
and
nodded
an
affirmative
nevertheless
he
had
grown
more
composed
during
the
journey
and
it
was
only
when
we
were
actually
approaching
the
house
that
his
face
again
began
to
grow
anxious
until
as
he
leaped
from
the
carriage
and
asked
foka
who
had
run
breathlessly
to
meet
us
how
is
natalia
nicolaevna
now
his
voice
was
trembling
and
his
eyes
had
filled
with
tears
the
good
old
foka
looked
at
us
and
then
lowered
his
gaze
again
finally
he
said
as
he
opened
the
and
turned
his
head
aside
it
is
the
sixth
day
since
she
has
not
left
her
milka
who
as
we
afterwards
learned
had
never
ceased
to
whine
from
the
day
when
mamma
was
taken
ill
came
leaping
joyfully
to
meet
papa
and
barking
a
welcome
as
she
licked
his
hands
but
papa
put
her
aside
and
went
first
to
the
and
then
into
the
divannaia
from
which
a
door
led
into
the
bedroom
the
nearer
he
approached
the
latter
the
more
did
his
movements
express
the
agitation
that
he
felt
entering
the
divannaia
he
crossed
it
on
tiptoe
seeming
to
hold
his
breath
even
then
he
had
to
stop
and
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
before
he
could
summon
up
courage
to
turn
the
handle
at
the
same
moment
mimi
with
dishevelled
hair
and
eyes
red
with
weeping
came
hastily
out
of
the
corridor
ah
peter
alexandritch
she
said
in
a
whisper
and
with
a
marked
expression
of
despair
then
observing
that
papa
was
trying
to
open
the
door
she
whispered
again
not
here
this
door
is
locked
go
round
to
the
door
on
the
other
oh
how
terribly
all
this
wrought
upon
my
imagination
racked
as
it
was
by
grief
and
terrible
forebodings
so
we
went
round
to
the
other
side
in
the
corridor
we
met
the
gardener
akim
who
had
been
wont
to
amuse
us
with
his
grimaces
but
at
this
moment
i
could
see
nothing
comical
in
him
indeed
the
sight
of
his
thoughtless
indifferent
face
struck
me
more
painfully
than
anything
else
in
the
maidservants
hall
through
which
we
had
to
pass
two
maids
were
sitting
at
their
work
but
rose
to
salute
us
with
an
expression
so
mournful
that
i
felt
completely
overwhelmed
passing
also
through
mimi
s
room
papa
opened
the
door
of
the
bedroom
and
we
entered
the
two
windows
on
the
right
were
curtained
over
and
close
to
them
was
seated
natalia
savishna
spectacles
on
nose
and
engaged
in
darning
stockings
she
did
not
approach
us
to
kiss
me
as
she
had
been
used
to
do
but
just
rose
and
looked
at
us
her
tears
beginning
to
flow
afresh
somehow
it
frightened
me
to
see
every
one
on
beholding
us
begin
to
cry
although
they
had
been
calm
enough
before
on
the
left
stood
the
bed
behind
a
screen
while
in
the
great
the
doctor
lay
asleep
beside
the
bed
a
young
and
remarkably
beautiful
girl
in
a
white
morning
wrapper
was
applying
ice
to
mamma
s
head
but
mamma
herself
i
could
not
see
this
girl
was
la
belle
flamande
of
whom
mamma
had
written
and
who
afterwards
played
so
important
a
part
in
our
family
life
as
we
entered
she
disengaged
one
of
her
hands
straightened
the
pleats
of
her
dress
on
her
bosom
and
whispered
she
is
though
i
was
in
an
agony
of
grief
i
observed
at
that
moment
every
little
detail
it
was
almost
dark
in
the
room
and
very
hot
while
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
mingled
scent
of
mint
camomile
and
hoffman
s
pastilles
the
latter
ingredient
caught
my
attention
so
strongly
that
even
now
i
can
never
hear
of
it
or
even
think
of
it
without
my
memory
carrying
me
back
to
that
dark
close
room
and
all
the
details
of
that
dreadful
time
mamma
s
eyes
were
wide
open
but
they
could
not
see
us
never
shall
i
forget
the
terrible
expression
in
them
the
expression
of
agonies
of
suffering
then
we
were
taken
away
when
later
i
was
able
to
ask
natalia
savishna
about
mamma
s
last
moments
she
told
me
the
following
after
you
were
taken
out
of
the
room
my
beloved
one
struggled
for
a
long
time
as
though
some
one
were
trying
to
strangle
her
then
at
last
she
laid
her
head
back
upon
the
pillow
and
slept
softly
peacefully
like
an
angel
from
heaven
i
went
away
for
a
moment
to
see
about
her
medicine
and
just
as
i
entered
the
room
again
my
darling
was
throwing
the
bedclothes
from
off
her
and
calling
for
your
papa
he
stooped
over
her
but
strength
failed
her
to
say
what
she
wanted
to
all
she
could
do
was
to
open
her
lips
and
gasp
my
god
my
god
the
children
the
children
i
would
have
run
to
fetch
you
but
ivan
vassilitch
stopped
me
saying
that
it
would
only
excite
her
it
were
best
not
to
do
so
then
suddenly
she
stretched
her
arms
out
and
dropped
them
again
what
she
meant
by
that
gesture
the
good
god
alone
knows
but
i
think
that
in
it
she
was
blessing
you
you
the
children
whom
she
could
not
see
god
did
not
grant
her
to
see
her
little
ones
before
her
death
then
she
raised
herself
up
did
my
love
my
darling
yes
just
so
with
her
hands
and
exclaimed
in
a
voice
which
i
can
not
bear
to
remember
mother
of
god
never
forsake
them
then
the
pain
mounted
to
her
heart
and
from
her
eyes
it
as
plain
that
she
suffered
terribly
my
poor
one
she
sank
back
upon
the
pillows
tore
the
bedclothes
with
her
teeth
and
wept
wept
yes
and
what
then
i
asked
but
natalia
savishna
could
say
no
more
she
turned
away
and
cried
bitterly
mamma
had
expired
in
terrible
agonies
xxvii
grief
late
the
following
evening
i
thought
i
would
like
to
look
at
her
once
more
so
conquering
an
involuntary
sense
of
fear
i
gently
opened
the
door
of
the
salon
and
entered
on
tiptoe
in
the
middle
of
the
room
on
a
table
lay
the
coffin
with
wax
candles
burning
all
round
it
on
tall
silver
candelabra
in
the
further
corner
sat
the
chanter
reading
the
psalms
in
a
low
monotonous
voice
i
stopped
at
the
door
and
tried
to
look
but
my
eyes
were
so
weak
with
crying
and
my
nerves
so
terribly
on
edge
that
i
could
distinguish
nothing
every
object
seemed
to
mingle
together
in
a
strange
blur
the
candles
the
brocade
the
velvet
the
great
candelabra
the
pink
satin
cushion
trimmed
with
lace
the
chaplet
of
flowers
the
ribboned
cap
and
something
of
a
transparent
colour
i
mounted
a
chair
to
see
her
face
yet
where
it
should
have
been
i
could
see
only
that
transparent
something
i
could
not
believe
it
to
be
her
face
yet
as
i
stood
grazing
at
it
i
at
last
recognised
the
beloved
features
i
shuddered
with
horror
to
realise
that
it
was
she
why
were
those
eyes
so
sunken
what
had
laid
that
dreadful
paleness
upon
her
cheeks
and
stamped
the
black
spot
beneath
the
transparent
skin
on
one
of
them
why
was
the
expression
of
the
whole
face
so
cold
and
severe
why
were
the
lips
so
white
and
their
outline
so
beautiful
so
majestic
so
expressive
of
an
unnatural
calm
that
as
i
looked
at
them
a
chill
shudder
ran
through
my
hair
and
down
my
back
somehow
as
i
gazed
an
irrepressible
incomprehensible
power
seemed
to
compel
me
to
keep
my
eyes
fixed
upon
that
lifeless
face
i
could
not
turn
away
and
my
imagination
began
to
picture
before
me
scenes
of
her
active
life
and
happiness
i
forgot
that
the
corpse
lying
before
me
now
the
thing
at
which
i
was
gazing
unconsciously
as
at
an
object
which
had
nothing
in
common
with
my
dreams
was
she
i
fancied
i
could
see
her
now
here
now
there
alive
happy
and
smiling
then
some
feature
in
the
face
at
which
i
was
gazing
would
suddenly
arrest
my
attention
and
in
a
flash
i
would
recall
the
terrible
reality
and
still
unable
to
turn
my
eyes
away
then
again
the
dreams
would
replace
reality
then
again
the
reality
put
to
flight
the
dreams
at
last
the
consciousness
of
both
left
me
and
for
a
while
i
became
insensible
how
long
i
remained
in
that
condition
i
do
not
know
nor
yet
how
it
occurred
i
only
know
that
for
a
time
i
lost
all
sense
of
existence
and
experienced
a
kind
of
vague
blissfulness
which
though
grand
and
sweet
was
also
sad
it
may
be
that
as
it
ascended
to
a
better
world
her
beautiful
soul
had
looked
down
with
longing
at
the
world
in
which
she
had
left
us
that
it
had
seen
my
sorrow
and
pitying
me
had
returned
to
earth
on
the
wings
of
love
to
console
and
bless
me
with
a
heavenly
smile
of
compassion
the
door
creaked
as
the
chanter
entered
who
was
to
relieve
his
predecessor
the
noise
awakened
me
and
my
first
thought
was
that
seeing
me
standing
on
the
chair
in
a
posture
which
had
nothing
touching
in
its
aspect
he
might
take
me
for
an
unfeeling
boy
who
had
climbed
on
to
the
chair
out
of
mere
curiosity
wherefore
i
hastened
to
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
to
bend
down
my
head
and
to
burst
out
crying
as
i
recall
now
my
impressions
of
that
episode
i
find
that
it
was
only
during
my
moments
of
that
my
grief
was
wholehearted
true
both
before
and
after
the
funeral
i
never
ceased
to
cry
and
to
look
miserable
yet
i
feel
when
i
recall
that
grief
of
mine
seeing
that
always
present
in
it
there
was
an
element
of
conceit
of
a
desire
to
show
that
i
was
more
grieved
than
any
one
else
of
an
interest
which
i
took
in
observing
the
effect
produced
upon
others
by
my
tears
and
of
an
idle
curiosity
leading
me
to
remark
mimi
s
bonnet
and
the
faces
of
all
present
the
mere
circumstance
that
i
despised
myself
for
not
feeling
grief
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
and
that
i
endeavoured
to
conceal
the
fact
shows
that
my
sadness
was
insincere
and
unnatural
i
took
a
delight
in
feeling
that
i
was
unhappy
and
in
trying
to
feel
more
so
consequently
this
egotistic
consciousness
completely
annulled
any
element
of
sincerity
in
my
woe
that
night
i
slept
calmly
and
soundly
as
is
usual
after
any
great
emotion
and
awoke
with
my
tears
dried
and
my
nerves
restored
at
ten
o
clock
we
were
summoned
to
attend
the
requiem
the
room
was
full
of
weeping
servants
and
peasants
who
had
come
to
bid
farewell
to
their
late
mistress
during
the
service
i
myself
wept
a
great
deal
made
frequent
signs
of
the
cross
and
performed
many
genuflections
but
i
did
not
pray
with
my
soul
and
felt
if
anything
almost
indifferent
my
thoughts
were
chiefly
centred
upon
the
new
coat
which
i
was
wearing
a
garment
which
was
tight
and
uncomfortable
and
upon
how
to
avoid
soiling
my
trousers
at
the
knees
also
i
took
the
most
minute
notice
of
all
present
papa
stood
at
the
head
of
the
coffin
he
was
as
white
as
snow
and
only
with
difficulty
restrained
his
tears
his
tall
figure
in
its
black
frockcoat
his
pale
expressive
face
the
graceful
assured
manner
in
which
as
usual
he
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
or
bowed
until
he
touched
the
floor
with
his
hand
a
custom
of
the
greek
funeral
rite
or
took
the
candle
from
the
priest
or
went
to
the
coffin
all
were
exceedingly
effective
yet
for
some
reason
or
another
i
felt
a
grudge
against
him
for
that
very
ability
to
appear
effective
at
such
a
moment
mimi
stood
leaning
against
the
wall
as
though
scarcely
able
to
support
herself
her
dress
was
all
awry
and
covered
with
feathers
and
her
cap
cocked
to
one
side
while
her
eyes
were
red
with
weeping
her
legs
trembling
under
her
and
she
sobbed
incessantly
in
a
heartrending
manner
as
ever
and
again
she
buried
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
or
her
hands
i
imagine
that
she
did
this
to
check
her
continual
sobbing
without
being
seen
by
the
spectators
i
remember
too
her
telling
papa
the
evening
before
that
mamma
s
death
had
come
upon
her
as
a
blow
from
which
she
could
never
hope
to
recover
that
with
mamma
she
had
lost
everything
but
that
the
angel
as
she
called
my
mother
had
not
forgotten
her
when
at
the
point
of
death
since
she
had
declared
her
wish
to
render
her
mimi
s
and
katenka
s
fortunes
secure
for
ever
mimi
had
shed
bitter
tears
while
relating
this
and
very
likely
her
sorrow
if
not
wholly
pure
and
disinterested
was
in
the
main
sincere
lubotshka
in
black
garments
and
suffused
with
tears
stood
with
her
head
bowed
upon
her
breast
she
rarely
looked
at
the
coffin
yet
whenever
she
did
so
her
face
expressed
a
sort
of
childish
fear
katenka
stood
near
her
mother
and
despite
her
lengthened
face
looked
as
lovely
as
ever
woloda
s
frank
nature
was
frank
also
in
grief
he
stood
looking
grave
and
as
though
he
were
staring
at
some
object
with
fixed
eyes
then
suddenly
his
lips
would
begin
to
quiver
and
he
would
hastily
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
bend
his
head
again
such
of
those
present
as
were
strangers
i
found
intolerable
in
fact
the
phrases
of
condolence
with
which
they
addressed
papa
such
for
instance
as
that
she
is
better
off
now
she
was
too
good
for
this
world
and
so
on
awakened
in
me
something
like
fury
what
right
had
they
to
weep
over
or
to
talk
about
her
some
of
them
in
referring
to
ourselves
called
us
orphans
just
as
though
it
were
not
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
that
children
who
have
lost
their
mother
are
known
as
orphans
probably
i
thought
they
liked
to
be
the
first
to
give
us
that
name
just
as
some
people
find
pleasure
in
being
the
first
to
address
a
girl
as
in
a
far
corner
of
the
room
and
almost
hidden
by
the
open
door
of
the
stood
a
grey
old
woman
with
bent
knees
with
hands
clasped
together
and
eyes
lifted
to
heaven
she
prayed
only
not
wept
her
soul
was
in
the
presence
of
god
and
she
was
asking
him
soon
to
reunite
her
to
her
whom
she
had
loved
beyond
all
beings
on
this
earth
and
whom
she
steadfastly
believed
that
she
would
very
soon
meet
again
there
stands
one
who
sincerely
loved
her
i
thought
to
myself
and
felt
ashamed
the
requiem
was
over
they
uncovered
the
face
of
the
deceased
and
all
present
except
ourselves
went
to
the
coffin
to
give
her
the
kiss
of
farewell
one
of
the
last
to
take
leave
of
her
departed
mistress
was
a
peasant
woman
who
was
holding
by
the
hand
a
pretty
little
girl
of
five
whom
she
had
brought
with
her
god
knows
for
what
reason
just
at
a
moment
when
i
chanced
to
drop
my
wet
handkerchief
and
was
stooping
to
pick
it
up
again
a
loud
piercing
scream
startled
me
and
filled
me
with
such
terror
that
were
i
to
live
a
hundred
years
more
i
should
never
forget
it
even
now
the
recollection
always
sends
a
cold
shudder
through
my
frame
i
raised
my
head
standing
on
the
chair
near
the
coffin
was
the
peasant
woman
while
struggling
and
fighting
in
her
arms
was
the
little
girl
and
it
was
this
same
poor
child
who
had
screamed
with
such
dreadful
desperate
frenzy
as
straining
her
terrified
face
away
she
still
continued
to
gaze
with
dilated
eyes
at
the
face
of
the
corpse
i
too
screamed
in
a
voice
perhaps
more
dreadful
still
and
ran
headlong
from
the
room
only
now
did
i
understand
the
source
of
the
strong
oppressive
smell
which
mingling
with
the
scent
of
the
incense
filled
the
chamber
while
the
thought
that
the
face
which
but
a
few
days
ago
had
been
full
of
freshness
and
beauty
the
face
which
i
loved
more
than
anything
else
in
all
the
world
was
now
capable
of
inspiring
horror
at
length
revealed
to
me
as
though
for
the
first
time
the
terrible
truth
and
filled
my
soul
with
despair
xxviii
sad
recollections
mamma
was
no
longer
with
us
but
our
life
went
on
as
usual
we
went
to
bed
and
got
up
at
the
same
times
and
in
the
same
rooms
breakfast
luncheon
and
supper
continued
to
be
at
their
usual
hours
everything
remained
standing
in
its
accustomed
place
nothing
in
the
house
or
in
our
mode
of
life
was
altered
only
she
was
not
there
yet
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
such
a
misfortune
ought
to
have
changed
everything
our
old
mode
of
life
appeared
like
an
insult
to
her
memory
it
recalled
too
vividly
her
presence
the
day
before
the
funeral
i
felt
as
though
i
should
like
to
rest
a
little
after
luncheon
and
accordingly
went
to
natalia
savishna
s
room
with
the
intention
of
installing
myself
comfortably
under
the
warm
soft
down
of
the
quilt
on
her
bed
when
i
entered
i
found
natalia
herself
lying
on
the
bed
and
apparently
asleep
but
on
hearing
my
footsteps
she
raised
herself
up
removed
the
handkerchief
which
had
been
protecting
her
face
from
the
flies
and
adjusting
her
cap
sat
forward
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
since
it
frequently
happened
that
i
came
to
lie
down
in
her
room
she
guessed
my
errand
at
once
and
said
so
you
have
come
to
rest
here
a
little
have
you
lie
down
then
my
oh
but
what
is
the
matter
with
you
natalia
savishna
i
exclaimed
as
i
forced
her
back
again
i
did
not
come
for
that
no
you
are
tired
yourself
so
you
lie
i
am
quite
rested
now
darling
she
said
though
i
knew
that
it
was
many
a
night
since
she
had
closed
her
eyes
yes
i
am
indeed
and
have
no
wish
to
sleep
again
she
added
with
a
deep
sigh
i
felt
as
though
i
wanted
to
speak
to
her
of
our
misfortune
since
i
knew
her
sincerity
and
love
and
thought
that
it
would
be
a
consolation
to
me
to
weep
with
her
natalia
savishna
i
said
after
a
pause
as
i
seated
myself
upon
the
bed
who
would
ever
have
thought
of
this
the
old
woman
looked
at
me
with
astonishment
for
she
did
not
quite
understand
my
question
yes
who
would
ever
have
thought
of
it
i
repeated
ah
my
darling
she
said
with
a
glance
of
tender
compassion
it
is
not
only
who
would
ever
have
thought
of
it
but
who
even
now
would
ever
believe
it
i
am
old
and
my
bones
should
long
ago
have
gone
to
rest
rather
than
that
i
should
have
lived
to
see
the
old
master
your
grandpapa
of
blessed
memory
and
prince
nicola
michaelovitch
and
his
two
brothers
and
your
sister
amenka
all
buried
before
me
though
all
younger
than
myself
and
now
my
darling
to
my
sorrow
gone
home
before
me
yet
it
has
been
god
s
will
he
took
her
away
because
she
was
worthy
to
be
taken
and
because
he
has
need
of
the
good
this
simple
thought
seemed
to
me
a
consolation
and
i
pressed
closer
to
natalia
she
laid
her
hands
upon
my
head
as
she
looked
upward
with
eyes
expressive
of
a
deep
but
resigned
sorrow
in
her
soul
was
a
sure
and
certain
hope
that
god
would
not
long
separate
her
from
the
one
upon
whom
the
whole
strength
of
her
love
had
for
many
years
been
concentrated
yes
my
dear
she
went
on
it
is
a
long
time
now
since
i
used
to
nurse
and
fondle
her
and
she
used
to
call
me
natasha
she
used
to
come
jumping
upon
me
and
caressing
and
kissing
me
and
say
my
nashik
my
darling
my
ducky
and
i
used
to
answer
jokingly
well
my
love
i
don
t
believe
that
you
do
love
me
you
will
be
a
young
lady
soon
and
going
away
to
be
married
and
will
leave
your
nashik
then
she
would
grow
thoughtful
and
say
i
think
i
had
better
not
marry
if
my
nashik
can
not
go
with
me
for
i
mean
never
to
leave
yet
alas
she
has
left
me
now
who
was
there
in
the
world
she
did
not
love
yes
my
dearest
it
must
never
be
possible
for
you
to
forget
your
mamma
she
was
not
a
being
of
earth
she
was
an
angel
from
heaven
when
her
soul
has
entered
the
heavenly
kingdom
she
will
continue
to
love
you
and
to
be
proud
of
you
even
but
why
do
you
say
when
her
soul
has
entered
the
heavenly
kingdom
i
asked
i
believe
it
is
there
no
my
dearest
replied
natalia
as
she
lowered
her
voice
and
pressed
herself
yet
closer
to
me
her
soul
is
still
here
and
she
pointed
upwards
she
spoke
in
a
whisper
but
with
such
an
intensity
of
conviction
that
i
too
involuntarily
raised
my
eyes
and
looked
at
the
ceiling
as
though
expecting
to
see
something
there
before
the
souls
of
the
just
enter
paradise
they
have
to
undergo
forty
trials
for
forty
days
and
during
that
time
they
hover
around
their
earthly
a
russian
popular
legend
she
went
on
speaking
for
some
time
in
this
strain
speaking
with
the
same
simplicity
and
conviction
as
though
she
were
relating
common
things
which
she
herself
had
witnessed
and
to
doubt
which
could
never
enter
into
any
one
s
head
i
listened
almost
breathlessly
and
though
i
did
not
understand
all
she
said
i
never
for
a
moment
doubted
her
word
yes
my
darling
she
is
here
now
and
perhaps
looking
at
us
and
listening
to
what
we
are
saying
concluded
natalia
raising
her
head
she
remained
silent
for
a
while
at
length
she
wiped
away
the
tears
which
were
streaming
from
her
eyes
looked
me
straight
in
the
face
and
said
in
a
voice
trembling
with
emotion
ah
it
is
through
many
trials
that
god
is
leading
me
to
him
why
indeed
am
i
still
here
whom
have
i
to
live
for
whom
have
i
to
love
do
you
not
love
us
then
i
asked
sadly
and
with
my
tears
yes
god
knows
that
i
love
you
my
darling
but
to
love
any
one
as
i
loved
her
that
i
can
not
she
could
say
no
more
but
turned
her
head
aside
and
wept
bitterly
as
for
me
i
no
longer
thought
of
going
to
sleep
but
sat
silently
with
her
and
mingled
my
tears
with
hers
presently
foka
entered
the
room
but
on
seeing
our
emotion
and
not
wishing
to
disturb
us
stopped
short
at
the
door
do
you
want
anything
my
good
foka
asked
natalia
as
she
wiped
away
her
tears
if
you
please
of
currants
four
pounds
of
sugar
and
three
pounds
of
rice
for
the
cakes
partaken
of
by
the
mourners
at
a
russian
funeral
yes
in
one
moment
said
natalia
as
she
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
hastened
to
her
drawers
all
traces
of
the
grief
aroused
by
our
conversation
disappeared
on
the
instant
that
she
had
duties
to
fulfil
for
she
looked
upon
those
duties
as
of
paramount
importance
but
why
four
pounds
she
objected
as
she
weighed
the
sugar
on
a
steelyard
three
and
a
half
would
be
sufficient
and
she
withdrew
a
few
lumps
how
is
it
too
that
though
i
weighed
out
eight
pounds
of
rice
yesterday
more
is
wanted
now
no
offence
to
you
foka
but
i
am
not
going
to
waste
rice
like
that
i
suppose
vanka
is
glad
that
there
is
confusion
in
the
house
just
now
for
he
thinks
that
nothing
will
be
looked
after
but
i
am
not
going
to
have
any
careless
extravagance
with
my
master
s
goods
did
one
ever
hear
of
such
a
thing
eight
pounds
well
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
he
says
it
is
all
gone
that
s
hm
hm
well
there
it
is
let
him
take
i
was
struck
by
the
sudden
transition
from
the
touching
sensibility
with
which
she
had
just
been
speaking
to
me
to
this
petty
reckoning
and
captiousness
yet
thinking
it
over
afterwards
i
recognised
that
it
was
merely
because
in
spite
of
what
was
lying
on
her
heart
she
retained
the
habit
of
duty
and
that
it
was
the
strength
of
that
habit
which
enabled
her
to
pursue
her
functions
as
of
old
her
grief
was
too
strong
and
too
true
to
require
any
pretence
of
being
unable
to
fulfil
trivial
tasks
nor
would
she
have
understood
that
any
one
could
so
pretend
vanity
is
a
sentiment
so
entirely
at
variance
with
genuine
grief
yet
a
sentiment
so
inherent
in
human
nature
that
even
the
most
poignant
sorrow
does
not
always
drive
it
wholly
forth
vanity
mingled
with
grief
shows
itself
in
a
desire
to
be
recognised
as
unhappy
or
resigned
and
this
ignoble
desire
an
aspiration
which
for
all
that
we
may
not
acknowledge
it
is
rarely
absent
even
in
cases
of
the
utmost
affliction
takes
off
greatly
from
the
force
the
dignity
and
the
sincerity
of
grief
natalia
savishna
had
been
so
sorely
smitten
by
her
misfortune
that
not
a
single
wish
of
her
own
remained
in
her
soul
she
went
on
living
purely
by
habit
having
handed
over
the
provisions
to
foka
and
reminded
him
of
the
refreshments
which
must
be
ready
for
the
priests
she
took
up
her
knitting
and
seated
herself
by
my
side
again
the
conversation
reverted
to
the
old
topic
and
we
once
more
mourned
and
shed
tears
together
these
talks
with
natalia
i
repeated
every
day
for
her
quiet
tears
and
words
of
devotion
brought
me
relief
and
comfort
soon
however
a
parting
came
three
days
after
the
funeral
we
returned
to
moscow
and
i
never
saw
her
again
grandmamma
received
the
sad
tidings
only
on
our
return
to
her
house
and
her
grief
was
extraordinary
at
first
we
were
not
allowed
to
see
her
since
for
a
whole
week
she
was
out
of
her
mind
and
the
doctors
were
afraid
for
her
life
not
only
did
she
decline
all
medicine
whatsoever
but
she
refused
to
speak
to
anybody
or
to
take
nourishment
and
never
closed
her
eyes
in
sleep
sometimes
as
she
sat
alone
in
the
in
her
room
she
would
begin
laughing
and
crying
at
the
same
time
with
a
sort
of
tearless
grief
or
else
relapse
into
convulsions
and
scream
out
dreadful
incoherent
words
in
a
horrible
voice
it
was
the
first
dire
sorrow
which
she
had
known
in
her
life
and
it
reduced
her
almost
to
distraction
she
would
begin
accusing
first
one
person
and
then
another
of
bringing
this
misfortune
upon
her
and
rail
at
and
blame
them
with
the
most
extraordinary
virulence
finally
she
would
rise
from
her
pace
the
room
for
a
while
and
end
by
falling
senseless
to
the
floor
once
when
i
went
to
her
room
she
appeared
to
be
sitting
quietly
in
her
chair
yet
with
an
air
which
struck
me
as
curious
though
her
eyes
were
wide
open
their
glance
was
vacant
and
meaningless
and
she
seemed
to
gaze
in
my
direction
without
seeing
me
suddenly
her
lips
parted
slowly
in
a
smile
and
she
said
in
a
touchingly
tender
voice
come
here
then
my
dearest
one
come
here
my
thinking
that
it
was
myself
she
was
addressing
i
moved
towards
her
but
it
was
not
i
whom
she
was
beholding
at
that
moment
oh
my
love
she
went
on
if
only
you
could
know
how
distracted
i
have
been
and
how
delighted
i
am
to
see
you
once
more
i
understood
then
that
she
believed
herself
to
be
looking
upon
mamma
and
halted
where
i
was
they
told
me
you
were
gone
she
concluded
with
a
frown
but
what
nonsense
as
if
you
could
die
before
me
and
she
laughed
a
terrible
hysterical
laugh
only
those
who
can
love
strongly
can
experience
an
overwhelming
grief
yet
their
very
need
of
loving
sometimes
serves
to
throw
off
their
grief
from
them
and
to
save
them
the
moral
nature
of
man
is
more
tenacious
of
life
than
the
physical
and
grief
never
kills
after
a
time
grandmamma
s
power
of
weeping
came
back
to
her
and
she
began
to
recover
her
first
thought
when
her
reason
returned
was
for
us
children
and
her
love
for
us
was
greater
than
ever
we
never
left
her
and
she
would
talk
of
mamma
and
weep
softly
and
caress
us
nobody
who
saw
her
grief
could
say
that
it
was
consciously
exaggerated
for
its
expression
was
too
strong
and
touching
yet
for
some
reason
or
another
my
sympathy
went
out
more
to
natalia
savishna
and
to
this
day
i
am
convinced
that
nobody
loved
and
regretted
mamma
so
purely
and
sincerely
as
did
that
affectionate
being
with
mamma
s
death
the
happy
time
of
my
childhood
came
to
an
end
and
a
new
epoch
the
epoch
of
my
boyhood
began
but
since
my
memories
of
natalia
savishna
who
exercised
such
a
strong
and
beneficial
influence
upon
the
bent
of
my
mind
and
the
development
of
my
sensibility
belong
rather
to
the
first
period
i
will
add
a
few
words
about
her
and
her
death
before
closing
this
portion
of
my
life
i
heard
later
from
people
in
the
village
that
after
our
return
to
moscow
she
found
time
hang
very
heavy
on
her
hands
although
the
drawers
and
shelves
were
still
under
her
charge
and
she
never
ceased
to
arrange
and
rearrange
them
to
take
things
out
and
to
dispose
of
them
afresh
she
sadly
missed
the
din
and
bustle
of
the
seignorial
mansion
to
which
she
had
been
accustomed
from
her
childhood
up
consequently
grief
the
alteration
in
her
mode
of
life
and
her
lack
of
activity
soon
combined
to
develop
in
her
a
malady
to
which
she
had
always
been
more
or
less
subject
scarcely
more
than
a
year
after
mamma
s
death
dropsy
showed
itself
and
she
took
to
her
bed
i
can
imagine
how
sad
it
must
have
been
for
her
to
go
on
living
still
more
to
die
alone
in
that
great
empty
house
at
petrovskoe
with
no
relations
or
any
one
near
her
every
one
there
esteemed
and
loved
her
but
she
had
formed
no
intimate
friendships
in
the
place
and
was
rather
proud
of
the
fact
that
was
because
enjoying
her
master
s
confidence
as
she
did
and
having
so
much
property
under
her
care
she
considered
that
intimacies
would
lead
to
culpable
indulgence
and
condescension
consequently
and
perhaps
also
because
she
had
nothing
really
in
common
with
the
other
servants
she
kept
them
all
at
a
distance
and
used
to
say
that
she
recognised
neither
kinsman
nor
godfather
in
the
house
and
would
permit
of
no
exceptions
with
regard
to
her
master
s
instead
she
sought
and
found
consolation
in
fervent
prayers
to
god
yet
sometimes
in
those
moments
of
weakness
to
which
all
of
us
are
subject
and
when
man
s
best
solace
is
the
tears
and
compassion
of
his
she
would
take
her
old
dog
moska
on
to
her
bed
and
talk
to
it
and
weep
softly
over
it
as
it
answered
her
caresses
by
licking
her
hands
with
its
yellow
eyes
fixed
upon
her
when
moska
began
to
whine
she
would
say
as
she
quieted
it
enough
enough
i
know
without
thy
telling
me
that
my
time
is
a
month
before
her
death
she
took
out
of
her
chest
of
drawers
some
fine
white
calico
white
cambric
and
pink
ribbon
and
with
the
help
of
the
maidservants
fashioned
the
garments
in
which
she
wished
to
be
buried
next
she
put
everything
on
her
shelves
in
order
and
handed
the
bailiff
an
inventory
which
she
had
made
out
with
scrupulous
accuracy
all
that
she
kept
back
was
a
couple
of
silk
gowns
an
old
shawl
and
grandpapa
s
military
uniform
things
which
had
been
presented
to
her
absolutely
and
which
thanks
to
her
care
and
orderliness
were
in
an
excellent
state
of
preservation
particularly
the
handsome
gold
embroidery
on
the
uniform
just
before
her
death
again
she
expressed
a
wish
that
one
of
the
gowns
a
pink
one
should
be
made
into
a
robe
de
chambre
for
woloda
that
the
other
one
a
gown
should
be
made
into
a
similar
garment
for
myself
and
that
the
shawl
should
go
to
lubotshka
as
for
the
uniform
it
was
to
devolve
either
to
woloda
or
to
myself
according
as
the
one
or
the
other
of
us
should
first
become
an
officer
all
the
rest
of
her
property
save
only
forty
roubles
which
she
set
aside
for
her
commemorative
rites
and
to
defray
the
costs
of
her
burial
was
to
pass
to
her
brother
a
person
with
whom
since
he
lived
a
dissipated
life
in
a
distant
province
she
had
had
no
intercourse
during
her
lifetime
when
eventually
he
arrived
to
claim
the
inheritance
and
found
that
its
only
amounted
to
roubles
in
notes
he
refused
to
believe
it
and
declared
that
it
was
impossible
that
his
woman
who
for
sixty
years
had
had
sole
charge
in
a
wealthy
house
as
well
as
all
her
life
had
been
penurious
and
averse
to
giving
away
even
the
smallest
thing
should
have
left
no
more
yet
it
was
a
fact
though
natalia
s
last
illness
lasted
for
two
months
she
bore
her
sufferings
with
truly
christian
fortitude
never
did
she
fret
or
complain
but
as
usual
appealed
continually
to
god
an
hour
before
the
end
came
she
made
her
final
confession
received
the
sacrament
with
quiet
joy
and
was
accorded
extreme
unction
then
she
begged
forgiveness
of
every
one
in
the
house
for
any
wrong
she
might
have
done
them
and
requested
the
priest
to
send
us
word
of
the
number
of
times
she
had
blessed
us
for
our
love
of
her
as
well
as
of
how
in
her
last
moments
she
had
implored
our
forgiveness
if
in
her
ignorance
she
had
ever
at
any
time
given
us
offence
yet
a
thief
have
i
never
been
never
have
i
used
so
much
as
a
piece
of
thread
that
was
not
my
such
was
the
one
quality
which
she
valued
in
herself
dressed
in
the
cap
and
gown
prepared
so
long
beforehand
and
with
her
head
resting
upon
the
cushion
made
for
the
purpose
she
conversed
with
the
priest
up
to
the
very
last
moment
until
suddenly
recollecting
that
she
had
left
him
nothing
for
the
poor
she
took
out
ten
roubles
and
asked
him
to
distribute
them
in
the
parish
lastly
she
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
lay
down
and
expired
pronouncing
with
a
smile
of
joy
the
name
of
the
almighty
she
quitted
life
without
a
pang
and
so
far
from
fearing
death
welcomed
it
as
a
blessing
how
often
do
we
hear
that
said
and
how
seldom
is
it
a
reality
natalia
savishna
had
no
reason
to
fear
death
for
the
simple
reason
that
she
died
in
a
sure
and
certain
faith
and
in
strict
obedience
to
the
commands
of
the
gospel
her
whole
life
had
been
one
of
pure
disinterested
love
of
utter
had
her
convictions
been
of
a
more
enlightened
order
her
life
directed
to
a
higher
aim
would
that
pure
soul
have
been
the
more
worthy
of
love
and
reverence
she
accomplished
the
highest
and
best
achievement
in
this
world
she
died
without
fear
and
without
repining
they
buried
her
where
she
had
wished
to
lie
near
the
little
mausoleum
which
still
covers
mamma
s
tomb
the
little
mound
beneath
which
she
sleeps
is
overgrown
with
nettles
and
burdock
and
surrounded
by
a
black
railing
but
i
never
forget
when
leaving
the
mausoleum
to
approach
that
railing
and
to
salute
the
plot
of
earth
within
by
bowing
reverently
to
the
ground
sometimes
too
i
stand
thoughtfully
between
the
railing
and
the
mausoleum
and
sad
memories
pass
through
my
mind
once
the
idea
came
to
me
as
i
stood
there
did
providence
unite
me
to
those
two
beings
solely
in
order
to
make
me
regret
them
my
life
long
