the

and
those
poems
which
are
meant
to
be
read
aloud
are
traditionally
printed
to
the
right
side
of
the
first
line
it
refers
to
this
is
possible
but
impracticable
to
imitate
in
a
simple
ascii
text
therefore
these
are
given
on
the
line
before
the
first
line
they
refer
to
and
are
furthermore
indented
spaces
and
enclosed
by
s
to
keep
it
clear
to
the
reader
which
parts
are
text
and
which
parts
directions
this
electronic
text
was
transcribed
from
a
reprint
of
the
original
edition
which
was
first
published
in
new
york
in
september
due
to
a
great
deal
of
irregularity
between
titles
in
the
table
of
contents
and
in
the
text
of
the
original
there
are
some
slight
differences
from
the
original
in
these
matters
with
the
more
complete
titles
replacing
cropped
ones
in
one
case
they
are
different
enough
that
both
are
given
and
twenty
poems
in
which
was
originally
twenty
moon
poems
in
the
table
of
contents
the
odd
thing
about
both
these
titles
is
that
there
are
actually
moon
poems

introduction
by
harriet
monroe
when
a
magazine
of
verse
was
first
published
in
chicago
in
the
autumn
of
an
illinois
poet
vachel
lindsay
was
quite
appropriately
one
of
its
first
discoveries
it
may
be
not
quite
without
significance
that
the
issue
of
january
which
led
off
with
william
booth
enters
into
heaven
immediately
followed
the
number
in
which
the
great
poet
of
bengal
rabindra
nath
tagore
was
first
presented
to
the
american
public
and
that
these
two
antipodal
poets
soon
appeared
in
person
among
the
earliest
visitors
to
the
editor
for
the
coming
together
of
east
and
west
may
prove
to
be
the
great
event
of
the
approaching
era
and
if
the
poetry
of
the
now
famous
bengali
laureate
garners
the
richest
wisdom
and
highest
spirituality
of
his
ancient
race
so
one
may
venture
to
believe
that
the
young
illinois
troubadour
brings
from
lincoln
city
an
authentic
strain
of
the
lyric
message
of
this
newer
world
it
is
hardly
necessary
perhaps
to
mention
lindsay
loyalty
to
the
people
of
his
place
and
hour
or
the
training
in
sympathy
with
their
aims
and
ideals
which
he
has
achieved
through
vagabondish
wanderings
in
the
middle
west
and
we
may
permit
time
to
decide
how
far
he
expresses
their
emotion
but
it
may
be
opportune
to
emphasize
his
plea
for
poetry
as
a
song
art
an
art
appealing
to
the
ear
rather
than
the
eye
the
first
section
of
this
volume
is
especially
an
effort
to
restore
poetry
to
its
proper
place
the
and
take
it
out
of
the
library
the
closet
in
the
library
it
has
become
so
far
as
the
people
are
concerned
almost
a
lost
art
and
perhaps
it
can
be
restored
to
the
people
only
through
a
renewal
of
its
appeal
to
the
ear
i
am
tempted
to
quote
from
lindsay
explanatory
note
which
accompanied
three
of
these
poems
when
they
were
first
printed
in
he
said
yeats
asked
me
recently
in
chicago
are
we
going
to
do
to
restore
the
primitive
singing
of
poetry
i
find
what
yeats
means
by
primitive
singing
of
poetry
in
professor
edward
bliss
new
volume
on
english
lyric
he
says
in
his
chapter
on
the
definition
of
the
lyric
the
greeks
song
was
an
term
it
included
the
crooning
of
the
nurse
to
the
child
the
chant
of
the
mower
or
sailor
the
formal
ode
sung
by
the
poet
in
all
greek
lyrics
even
in
the
choral
odes
music
was
the
handmaid
of
verse
the
poet
himself
composed
the
accompaniment
euripides
was
censured
because
iophon
had
assisted
him
in
the
musical
setting
of
some
of
his
dramas
here
is
pictured
a
type
of
greek
work
which
survives
in
american
vaudeville
where
every
line
may
be
spoken
and
sung
the
entire
rendering
musical
and
elocutionary
depending
upon
the
improvising
power
and
sure
instinct
of
the
performer
i
respectfully
submit
these
poems
as
experiments
in
which
i
endeavor
to
carry
this
vaudeville
form
back
towards
the
old
greek
precedent
of
the
lyric
in
this
case
the
of
music
must
be
added
by
the
instinct
of
the
reader
he
must
be
iophon
and
he
can
easily
be
iophon
if
he
brings
to
bear
upon
the
piece
what
might
be
called
the
higher
vaudeville
imagination
big
general
contrasts
between
the
main
sections
should
be
the
rule
of
the
first
attempts
at
improvising
it
is
the
hope
of
the
writer
that
after
two
or
three
readings
each
line
will
suggest
its
own
separate
touch
of
melody
to
the
reader
who
has
become
accustomed
to
the
cadences
let
him
read
what
he
likes
read
and
sing
what
he
likes
sung
it
was
during
this
same
visit
in
chicago
at
banquet
on
the
evening
of
march
first
that
yeats
honored
lindsay
by
addressing
his
talk
primarily
to
him
as
a
fellow
craftsman
and
by
saying
of
booth
this
poem
is
stripped
bare
of
ornament
it
has
an
earnest
simplicity
a
strange
beauty
and
you
know
bacon
said
is
no
excellent
beauty
without
strangeness
this
recognition
from
the
distinguished
irish
poet
tempts
me
to
hint
at
the
cosmopolitan
aspects
of
such
racily
local
art
as
lindsay
the
subject
is
too
large
for
a
merely
introductory
word
but
the
reader
may
be
invited
to
reflect
upon
it
if
lindsay
poetry
should
cross
the
ocean
it
would
not
be
the
first
time
that
our
most
indigenous
art
has
reacted
upon
the
art
of
older
nations
besides
poe
who
though
indigenous
in
ways
too
subtle
for
brief
analysis
yet
passed
all
frontiers
in
his
swift
sad
flight
the
two
american
artists
of
widest
influence
whitman
and
whistler
have
been
intensely
american
in
temperament
and
in
the
special
spiritual
quality
of
their
art
if
whistler
was
the
first
great
artist
to
accept
the
modern
message
in
oriental
art
if
whitman
was
the
first
great
modern
poet
to
discard
the
limitations
of
conventional
form
if
both
were
more
free
more
individual
than
their
contemporaries
this
was
the
expression
of
their
americanism
which
may
perhaps
be
defined
as
a
spiritual
independence
and
love
of
adventure
inherited
from
the
pioneers
foreign
artists
are
usually
the
first
to
recognize
this
new
tang
one
detects
the
influence
of
the
great
dead
poet
and
dead
painter
in
all
modern
art
which
looks
forward
instead
of
back
and
their
countrymen
our
own
contemporary
poets
and
painters
often
express
indirectly
through
french
influences
a
reaction
which
they
are
reluctant
to
confess
directly
a
lighter
phase
of
this
foreign
enthusiasm
for
the
american
tang
is
confessed
by
signor
marinetti
the
italian
futurist
when
in
his
article
on
and
the
theatre
in
mask
he
urges
the
revolutionary
value
of
american
eccentrics
citing
the
fundamental
primitive
quality
in
their
vaudeville
art
this
may
be
another
statement
of
lindsay
plea
for
a
closer
relation
between
the
poet
and
his
audience
for
a
return
to
the
healthier
conditions
and
immediate
personal
contacts
in
the
art
of
the
greeks
and
of
primitive
nations
such
conditions
and
contacts
may
still
be
found
if
the
world
only
knew
it
in
the
wonderful
of
the
hopis
and
others
of
our
aboriginal
tribes
they
may
be
found
also
in
a
measure
in
the
quick
response
between
artist
and
audience
in
modern
vaudeville
they
are
destined
to
a
wider
and
higher
influence
in
fact
the
development
of
that
influence
the
return
to
primitive
sympathies
between
artist
and
audience
which
may
make
possible
once
more
the
assertion
of
primitive
creative
power
is
recognized
as
the
immediate
movement
in
modern
art
it
is
a
movement
strong
enough
to
persist
in
spite
of
extravagances
and
absurdities
strong
enough
it
may
be
hoped
to
fulfil
its
purpose
and
revitalize
the
world
it
is
because
lindsay
poetry
seems
to
be
definitely
in
that
movement
that
it
is
i

terror
and
power
end
with
joy
then
i
saw
the
congo
creeping
through
the
black
cutting
through
the
jungle
with
a
golden
track
and
the
gray
sky
opened
like
a
veil
and
showed
the
apostles
with
their
coats
of
mail
in
bright
white
steele
they
were
seated
round
and
their
watched
where
the
congo
wound
and
the
twelve
apostles
from
their
thrones
on
high
thrilled
all
the
forest
with
their
heavenly
cry
sung
to
the
tune
of
hark
ten
thousand
harps
and
voices
will
die
in
the
jungle
never
again
will
he
you
never
again
will
he
you
with
growing
deliberation
and
joy
then
along
that
river
a
thousand
miles
the
trees
fell
down
in
files
pioneer
angels
cleared
the
way
for
a
congo
paradise
for
babes
at
play
for
sacred
capitals
for
temples
clean
gone
were
the
lean
in
a
rather
high
key
as
delicately
as
possible
there
where
the
wild
had
wailed
a
million
boats
of
the
angels
sailed
with
oars
of
silver
and
prows
of
blue
and
silken
pennants
that
the
sun
shone
through
was
a
land
transfigured
was
a
new
creation
oh
a
singing
wind
swept
the
negro
nation
and
on
through
the
backwoods
clearing
flew
to
the
tune
of
hark
ten
thousand
harps
and
voices
is
dead
in
the
jungle
never
again
will
he
you
never
again
will
he
you
redeemed
were
the
forests
the
beasts
and
the
men
and
only
the
vulture
dared
again
by
the
far
lone
mountains
of
the
moon
to
cry
in
the
silence
the
congo
tune
dying
down
into
a
penetrating
terrified
whisper

you

you

this
poem
particularly
the
third

ere
his

he

he
could
play
any
pipe
so
dull
in
the
school
that
he
scarcely
could
spell
he
read
but
a
bit
and
he
figured
not
well
a
fool
shod
only
with
grace
long
hair
streaming
down
round
a
face
he
smiled
like
a
girl
or
like
clear
winter
skies
a
virginal
light
making
stars
of
his
eyes
in
swiftness
and
poise
a
proud
child
of
the
deer
a
white
fawn
he
was
yet
a
fawn
without
fear
no
youth
thought
him
vain
or
made
mock
of
his
hair
or
laughed
when
his
ways
were
most
curiously
fair
a
mastiff
at
fight
he
could
strike
to
the
earth
the
envious
one
who
would
challenge
his
worth
however
we
bowed
to
the
schoolmaster
mild
our
spirits
went
out
to
the
child
his
beckoning
led
our
troop
to
the
brush
we
found
nothing
there
but
a
wind
and
a
hush
he
sat
by
a
stone
and
he
looked
on
the
ground
as
if
in
the
weeds
there
was
something
profound
his
pipe
seemed
to
neigh
then
to
bleat
like
a
sheep
then
sound
like
a
stream
or
a
waterfall
deep
it
whispered
strange
tales
human
words
it
spoke
not
told
fair
things
to
come
and
our
marvellous
lot
if
now
with
unshod
we
advanced
to
the
midst
of
the
grove
and
in
reverence
danced
we
obeyed
as
he
piped
soft
grass
to
young
feet
was
a
medicine
mighty
a
remedy
meet
our
thin
blood
awoke
it
grew
dizzy
and
wild
though
scarcely
a
word
moved
the
lips
of
a
child
our
dance
gave
allegiance
it
set
us
apart
we
tripped
a
strange
measure
uplifted
of
heart
ii
we
thought
to
be
proud
of
our
fawn
everywhere
we
could
hardly
see
how
simple
books
were
a
care
no
rule
of
the
school
this
strange
student
could
tame
he
was
banished
one
day
while
we
quivered
with
shame
he
piped
back
our
love
on
a
night
enticed
us
once
more
to
the
place
of
delight
a
greeting
he
sang
and
it
made
our
blood
beat
it
tramped
upon
custom
and
mocked
at
defeat
he
builded
a
fire
and
we
tripped
in
a
ring
the
embers
our
books
and
the
fawn
our
good
king
and
now
we
approached
all
the
mysteries
rare
that
shadowed
his
eyelids
and
blew
through
his
hair
that
spell
now
was
peace
the
deep
strength
of
the
trees
the
children
of
nature
we
clambered
her
knees
our
breath
and
our
moods
were
in
tune
with
her
own
tremendous
her
presence
eternal
her
throne
the
ostracized
child
our
white
foreheads
kissed
our
bodies
and
souls
became
lighter
than
mist
sweet
dresses
like
snow
our
small
wore
like
moonlight
the
thoughts
that
our
bosoms
upbore
like
a
lily
the
touch
of
each
cold
little
hand
the
loves
of
the
stars
we
could
now
understand
o
quivering
air
o
the
crystalline
night
o
pauses
of
awe
and
the
faces
o
ferns
in
the
dusk
o
hour
o
earth
that
sent
upward
the
thrill
and
the
power
to
lift
us
like
leaves
a
delirious
whirl
the
masterful
boy
and
the
delicate
girl
what
child
that
strange
can
ever
forget
his
fealty
due
and
his
infinite
debt
to
the
folly
divine
to
the
exquisite
rule
of
the
perilous
master
the
fool
iii
now
soldiers
we
seem
and
night
brings
a
new
thing
a
terrible
ire
as
of
thunder
awing
a
warrior
power
that
old
chivalry
stirred
when
knights
took
up
arms
as
the
maidens
gave
word
the
end
of
our
war
will
be
glory
untold
when
the
town
like
a
great
budding
rose
shall
unfold
nearer
that
war
and
that
ecstasy
comes
we
hear
the
trees
beating
invisible
drums
the
fields
of
the
night
are
starlit
above
our
girls
are
white
torches
of
conquest
and
love
no
nerve
without
will
and
no
breast
without
breath
we
whirl
with
the
planets
that
never

this

burned

he

cold

mighty
as

stern
as

unsubdued
by
burning
dawn
led
his
continentals
vast
they
were
and
strange
to
see
in
gray
old
regimentals
marching
still
with
bleeding
feet
bleeding
feet
and
jesting
marching
from
the
judgment
throne
with
energy
unresting
how
their
merry
quickstep
played
silver
sharp
sonorous
piercing
through
with
prophecy
the
demons
rumbling
chorus
behold
the
ancient
powers
of
sin
and

before
them
sworn
to
stop
the
glorious

hung
them

rose
to
blast
the

tiger
faces

plotting
bloodshed
for
the
patient
toiling

round
the

their
cannon
raged
hurling
bolts
of
thunder
yet
before
our

their
host
was
cut
asunder
like
a
mist
they
fled
away
ended
wrath
and
roaring
still
our

went
pouring
high
beside
the
sun
of
noon
they
bore
our

i
heard
immanuel
singing
the
poem
shows
the
master
with
his
work
done
singing
to
free
his
heart
in
heaven
this
poem
is
intended
to
be
half
said
half
sung
very
softly
to
the
tune
last
night
i
lay
there
came
a
dream
so
fair
i
stood
in
old
jerusalem
beside
the
temple
there
etc
yet
this
tune
is
not
to
be
fitted
on
arbitrarily
it
is
here
given
to
suggest
the
manner
of
handling
rather
than
determine
it
to
be
sung
i
heard
immanuel
singing
within
his
own
good
lands
i
saw
him
bend
above
his
harp
i
watched
his
wandering
hands
lost
amid
the
sweet
sweet
i
heard
him
play
his
wounds
were
altogether
healed
old
things
had
passed
away
all
things
were
new
but
music
the
blood
of
david
ran
within
the
son
of
david
our
god
the
son
of
man
he
was
ruddy
like
a
shepherd
his
bold
young
face
how
fair
apollo
of
the
silver
bow
had
not
such
flowing
hair
to
be
read
very
softly
but
in
spirited
response
i
saw
immanuel
singing
on
a
hill
the
glad
remembering
branches
dimly
echoed
still
the
grand
new
song
proclaiming
the
lamb
that
had
been
slain
the
holy
city
gleamed
in
the
murmuring
plain
the
crowning
hours
were
over
the
pageants
all
were
past
within
the
many
mansions
the
hosts
grown
still
at
last
in
homes
of
holy
mystery
slept
long
by
crooning
springs
or
waked
to
peaceful
glory
a
universe
of
kings
to
be
sung
he
left
his
people
happy
he
wandered
free
to
sigh
alone
in
lowly
friendship
with
the
green
grass
and
the
sky
he
murmured
ancient
music
his
red
heart
burned
to
sing
because
his
perfect
conquest
had
grown
a
weary
thing
no
chant
of
gilded
triumph
his
lonely
song
was
made
of
art
deliberate
freedom
of
minor
chords
arrayed
in
soft
and
shadowy
colors
that
once
were
radiant
flowers
the
rose
of
sharon
bleeding
in
bowers
and
all
the
other
roses
in
the
songs
of
east
and
west
of
love
and
war
and
worshipping
and
every
shield
and
crest
of

or
of

or
sacred
lily
wrought
in
creeds
and
psalms
and
palaces
and
temples
of
white
thought
to
be
read
very
softly
yet
in
spirited
response
all
these
he
sang
and
weeping
as
he
smiled
laughing
talking
to
his
harp
as
to
a
child
as
though
the
arts
forgotten
but
bloomed
to
prophecy
these
careless
fearless
in
the
sky
to
be
sung
when
this
his
hour
of
sorrow
for
flowers
and
arts
of
men
has
passed
in
ghostly
music
i
asked
my
wild
heart
then
what
will
he
sing
what

all
his
own

set
free
rejoicing
with
a
green

some

guide
him

his

open

young
the
sun
is
a

red
joy
the
sun
is
an
indian
girl
of
the
tribe
of
the
illinois
the
sun
is
a
smouldering
fire
that
creeps
through
the
high
gray
plain
and
leaves
not
a
bush
of
cloud
to
blossom
with
flowers
of
rain
noon
the
sun
is
a
wounded
deer
that
treads
pale
grass
in
the
skies
shaking
his
golden
horns
flashing
his
baleful
eyes
sunset
the
sun
is
an
eagle
old
there
in
the
windless
west
atop
of
the
he
builds
him
a
crimson
nest
the
hearth
eternal
there
dwelt
a
widow
learned
and
devout
behind
our
hamlet
on
the
eastern
hill
three
sons
she
had
who
went
to
find
the
world
they
promised
to
return
but
wandered
still
the
cities
used
them
well
they
won
their
way
rich
gifts
they
sent
to
still
their
mother
sighs
worn
out
with
honors
and
apart
from
her
they
died
as
many
a
exile
dies
the
mother
had
a
hearth
that
would
not
quench
the
deathless
embers
fought
the
creeping
gloom
she
said
to
us
who
came
with
wondering
eyes
this
is
a
magic
fire
a
magic
room
the
pine
burned
out
but
still
the
coals
glowed
on
her
grave
grew
old
beneath
the
shade
and
yet
her
crumbling
home
enshrined
the
light
the
neighbors
peering
in
were
half
afraid
then
sturdy
beggars
needing
fagots
came
one
at
a
time
and
stole
the
walls
and
floor
they
left
a
naked
stone
but
how
it
blazed
and
in
the
thunderstorm
it
flared
the
more
and
now
it
was
that
men
were
heard
to
say
this
light
should
be
beloved
by
all
the
town
at
last
they
made
the
slope
a
place
of
prayer
where
marvellous
thoughts
from
god
came
sweeping
down
they
left
their
churches
crumbling
in
the
sun
they
met
on
that
soft
hill
one
brotherhood
one
strength
and
valor
only
one
delight
one
laughing
brooding
genius
great
and
good
now
many
prodigals
come
home
the
place
the
cities
of
the
land
and
brahmans
reach
us
from
afar
with
subtle
eyes
prepared
to
understand

the
eastern
steep
showing
the
roads
that

a

beacon
the

it

thus
has
the
widow
conquered
half
the
earth
she
who
increased
in

though
all
alone
who
kept

pausing

with
happy

and
now
i
feel
those
kisses
on
my
mouth
hers
most
of
all
one
little

most
kind
i
went
down
into

desert
i
went
down
into
the
desert
to
meet
elijah
arisen
from
the
dead
i
thought
to
find
him
in
an
echoing
cave
so
my
dream
had
i
went
down
into
the
desert
to
meet
john
the
baptist
i
walked
with
feet
that
bled
seeking
that
prophet
lean
and
brown
and
bold
spied
foul
fiends
i
went
down
into
the
desert
to
meet
my
god
by
him
be
comforted
i
went
down
into
the
desert
to
meet
my
god
i
met
the
devil
in
i
went
down
into
the
desert
to
meet
my
god
o
lord
my
god
awaken
from
the
dead
i
see
you
there
your
on
the
ground
i
see
you
there
in
the
sand
i
see
you
there
your
white
bones
glistening
bare
round
your
love
and
law
true
love
is
founded
in
rocks
of
remembrance
in
stones
of
forbearance
and
mortar
of
pain
the
workman
lays
wearily
granite
on
granite
and
bleeds
for
his
castle
sunshine
and
rain
love
is
not
velvet
not
all
of
it
velvet
not
all
of
it
banners
not
alone
is
stern
as
the
ages
and
old
as
religion
with
patience
its
watchword
and
law
for
its
throne
the
perfect
marriage
i
i
hate
this
yoke
for
the
world
sake
here
put
it
on
knowing
weigh
as
much
on
you
till
life
is
gone
knowing
you
love
your
freedom
dear
as
i
love
mine
knowing
that
love
unchained
has
been
our
life
great
wine
our
one
great
wine
yet
spent
too
soon
and
serving
none
of
the
two
cups
free
love
at
last
the
deadly
one
ii
we
grant
our
meetings
will
be
tame
not
no
longer
turning
to
the
tryst
with
flying
feet
we
know
the
toil
that
now
must
come
will
spoil
the
bloom
and
tenderness
of
passion
touch
and
in
its
room
will
come
tame
habit
deadly
calm
sorrow
and
gloom
oh
how
the
battle
scars
the
best
who
enter
life
each
soldier
comes
out
blind
or
lame
from
the
black
strife
mad
or
diseased
or
damned
of
soul
the
best
may
come
it
matters
not
how
merrily
now
rolls
the
drum
the
fife
shrills
high
the
horn
sings
loud
till
no
steps
lag
and
all
adore
that
silken
flame
desire
great
flag
iii
we
will
build
strong
our
tiny
fort
strong
as
we
can
holding
one
inner
room
beyond
the
sword
of
man
love
is
too
wide
it
seems
to
hide
it
there
it
seems
to
flood
the
fields
of
corn
and
gild
the
air
it
seems
to
breathe
from
every
brook
from
flowers
to
sigh
it
seems
a
cataract
poured
down
from
the
great
sky
it
seems
a
tenderness
so
vast
no
bush
but
shows
its
haunting
and
transfiguring
light
where
wonder
glows
it
wraps
us
in
a
silken
snare
by
shadowy
streams
and
wildering
sweet
and
stung
with
joy
your
white
soul
seems
a
flame
a
flame
conquering
day
conquering
night
brought
from
our
god
a
holy
thing
a
mad
delight
but
love
when
all
things
beat
it
down
leaves
the
wide
air
the
heavens
are
gray
and
men
turn
wolves
lean
with
despair
ah
when
we
need
love
most
and
weep
when
all
is
dark
love
is
a
pinch
of
ashes
gray
with
one
live
spark
yet
on
the
hope
to
keep
alive
that
treasure
strange
hangs
all
earth
struggle
strife
and
scorn
and
desperate
change
iv
love
we
will
scarcely
love
our
babes
full
many
a
time
knowing
their
souls
and
ours
too
well
and
all
our
grime
and
there
beside
our
holy
hearth
we
hide
our
eyes
lest
we
should
flash
what
seems
disdain
without
disguise
yet
there
shall
be
no
wavering
there
in
that
deep
trial
and
no
false
fire
or
stranger
hand
or
traitor
vile
we
fight
the
gloom
and
fight
the
world
with
strong
entrenched
within
our
small
ever
at
bay
as
underpaid
wounded
and
wild
true
to
their
battered
flag
their
faith
still
undefiled
darling
daughter
of
babylon
too
soon
you
wearied
of
our
tears
and
then
you
danced
with
spangled
feet
leading
belshazzar
chattering
court
through
the
shadowy
street
with
mead
they
came
with
chants
of
shame
desire
red
flag
before
them
flew
and
istar
music
moved
your
mouth
and
baal
deep
shames
rewoke
in
you
now
you
could
drive
the
royal
car
forget
our
nation
breaking
load
now
you
could
sleep
on
silver
beds
bitter
and
dark
was
our
abode
and
so
for
many
a
night
you
laughed
and
knew
not
of
my
hopeless
prayer
till
god
own
spirit
whipped
you
forth
from
istar
shrine
from
istar
stair
darling
daughter
of
babylon
rose
by
the
black
euphrates
flood
again
your
beauty
grew
more
dear
than
my
slave
bread
than
my
heart
blood
we
sang
of
zion
good
to
know
where
righteousness
and
peace
abide
what
of
your
second
sacrilege
carousing
at
belshazzar
side
once
by
a
stream
we
clasped
tired
hands
your
paint
and
henna
washed
away
your
place
you
said
was
with
the
slaves
who
sewed
the
thick
cloth
night
and
day
you
were
a
pale
and
holy
maid
with
us
one
night
you
said
your
god
shall
be
my
god
until
i
slumber
with
the
patriarch
dead
pardon
daughter
of
babylon
if
on
this
night
remembering
our
lover
walks
under
the
walls
of
hanging
gardens
in
the
spring
a
venom
comes
from
broken
hope
from
memories
of
your
until
i
curse
your
painted
eyes
and
do
your
too
much
wrong
the
amaranth
ah
in
the
night
all
music
haunts
me
here
is
it
for
naught
high
heaven
cracks
and
yawns
and
the
tremendous
amaranth
descends
sweet
with
the
glory
of
ten
thousand
dawns
does
it
not
mean
my
god
would
have
me
say
whether
you
will
or
no
o
city
young
heaven
will
bloom
like
one
great
flower
for
you
flash
and
loom
greatly
all
your
marts
among
friends
i
will
not
cease
hoping
though
you
weep
such
things
i
see
and
some
of
them
shall
come
though
now
our
streets
are
harsh
and
though
our
strong
youths
are
strident
now
or
dumb
friends
that
sweet
town
that
shall
rise
naught
can
delay
it
though
it
may
not
be
just
as
i
dream
it
comes
at
last
i
know
with
streets
like
channels
of
an
the
alchemist
petition
thou
wilt
not
sentence
to
eternal
life
my
soul
that
prays
that
it
may
sleep
and
sleep
like
a
white
statue
dropped
into
the
deep
covered
with
sand
covered
with
chests
of
gold
and
tossed
from
many
a
pirate
hold
but
for
this
prayer
thou
wilt
not
bind
in
hell
my
soul
that
shook
with
love
for
fame
and
truth
in
such
unquenched
desires
consumed
his
youth
let
me
turn
dust
like
dead
leaves
in
the
fall
or
wood
that
lights
an
hour
your
knightly
hall
amen
two
easter
stanzas
i
the
hope
of
the
resurrection
though
i
have
watched
so
many
mourners
weep
the
real
dead
in
dull
earth
laid
asleep
those
dead
seemed
but
the
shadows
of
my
days
that
passed
and
left
me
in
the
sun
bright
rays
now
though
you
go
on
smiling
in
the
sun
our
love
is
slain
and
love
and
you
were
one
you
are
the
first
you
i
have
known
so
long
whose
death
was
deadly
a
tremendous
wrong
therefore
i
seek
the
faith
that
sets
it
right
amid
the
lilies
and
the
i
think
on
heaven
for
in
that
air
so
clear
we
two
may
meet
confused
and
parted
here
ah
when
man
dearest
dies
is
then
he
goes
to
that
old
balm
that
heals
the
centuries
woes
then
christ
wild
cry
in
all
the
streets
is
rife
i
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
ii
we
meet
at
the
judgment
and
i
fear
it
not
though
better
men
may
fear
that
trumpet
warning
i
meet
you
lady
on
the
judgment
morning
with
golden
hope
my
spirit
still
adorning
our
god
who
made
you
all
so
fair
and
sweet
is
three
times
gentle
and
before
his
feet
rejoicing
i
shall
say
the
girl
you
gave
was
my
first
heaven
an
angel
bent
to
save
oh
god
her
maker
if
my
ingrate
breath
is
worth
this
rescue
from
the
second
death
perhaps
her
dear
proud
eyes
grow
gentler
too
that
scorned
my
graceless
years
and
trophies
few
gone
are
those
years
and
gone
that
turned
her
sacred
beauty
from
my
songs
that
burned
we
now
as
comrades
through
the
stars
may
take
the
rich
and
arduous
quests
i
did
forsake
grant
me
a
to
thread
the
throng
and
quickly
find
that
so
strong
i
dream
that
in
her
heart
hurt
love
lived
on
though
we
were
far
apart
a
brooding
secret
mercy
like
your
own
that
blooms
to
vindicate
your
throne
the
to
a
man
who
maintained
that
the
mausoleum
is
the
stateliest
possible
manner
of
interment
i
would
be
one
with
the
dark
dark
earth
follow
the
plough
with
a
yokel
tread
i
would
be
part
of
the
indian
corn
walking
the
rows
with
the
plumes
i
would
be
one
with
the
lavish
earth
eating
the
apples
red
walking
where
lambs
walk
on
the
hills
by
paths
to
the
pools
be
led
i
would
be
one
with
the
night
when
sparkling
skies
and
the
lightning
wed
walking
on
with
the
vicious
wind
by
roads
whence

year

and
every
day
at

you
have
been
my
valentine
once
a
page
in
hose
in
flower
cloakless
shrinking
in
that
hour
how
our
reverent
passion
rose
how
our
fine
desire
you
won
another
day
shapeless
wooden
every
way
next
a
fairy
from
the
sun
once
you
walked
a
strand
siren
full
of
lure
snaring
with
devices
sure
lads
who
murdered
on
the
sand
but
on
most
days
just
a
child
dimpled
as
no
are
cold
of
kiss
as
some
north
star
violet
from
the
valleys
wild
snared
as
innocence
must
be
fleeing
prisoned
chained
at
the
end
of
tortures
dread
roaring
cowboys
set
you
free
fly
o
song
to
her
like
a
cowboy
cross
the
land
snatch
her
from
belasco
hand
and
that
prison
called
broadway
all
the
village
swains
await
one
dear
demure
saucy
dancing
cold
and
pure
elf
who
must
return
in
state
blanche
sweet
actress
after
seeing
the
reel
called
oil
and
water
beauty
has
a
in
our
humorous
town
spoiling
its
laughing
shadows
down
rank
musicians
torture
ragtime
ballads
vile
but
we
walk
serenely
down
the
odorous
aisle
we
forgive
the
squalor
and
the
boom
and
squeal
for
the
great
queen
flashes
from
the
moving
reel
just
a
prim
blonde
stranger
in
her
early
day
hiding
brilliant
weapons
too
averse
to
play
then
she
burst
upon
us
dancing
through
the
night
oh
her
maiden
radiance
veils
and
roses
white
with
new
powers
yet
cautious
not
too
smart
or
skilled
that
first
flash
of
dancing
wrought
the
thing
she
willed
mobs
of
us
made
noble
by
her
strong
desire
by
her
white
uplifting
royal
though
the
tin
piano
snarls
its
tango
rude
though
the
chairs
are
shaky
and
the
dramas
crude
solemn
are
her
motions
stately
are
her
wiles
filling
oafs
with
wisdom
saving
souls
with
smiles
the
restless
actors
she
is
rich
and
slow
she
will
stand
like
marble
she
will
pause
and
glow
though
the
film
is
twitching
keep
a
peaceful
reign
ruler
of
her
passion
ruler

our

sunshine
for
a
very
little

not

old

the

gives
not

the

not

are
these

the

the

not
by

do

yet
sunshine
fashions
all

that

corn
that
seems

somehow
from

and
so
your
soul
my
lady
mere
sunshine
nothing
more
prepares
me
the
contraptions
i
work
with
or
adore
within
me
cornfields
rustle
niagaras
roar
their
way
vast
thunderstorms
and
rainbows
are
in
my
thought
ten
thousand
anvils
sound
there
by
forges
flaming
white
and
many
books
i
read
there
and
many
books
i
write
and
freedom
bells
are
ringing
and
chant
and
fly
the
whole
world
works
in
me
and
all
the
shining
sky
because
of
one
small
lady
whose
smile
is
my
chief
sun
she
gives
not
any
gift
to
me
yet
all
gifts
giving
one
amen
an
apology
for
the
bottle
volcanic
sometimes
i
dip
my
pen
and
find
the
bottle
full
of
fire
the
salamanders
flying
forth
i
can
not
but
admire
it
etna
or
vesuvius
if
those
big
things
were
small
and
then
is
but
itself
again
and
does
not
smoke
at
all
and
so
my
blood
grows
cold
i
say
the
bottle
held
but
ink
and
if
you
thought
it
otherwise
the
worser
for
your
think
and
then
just
as
i
throw
my
scribbled
paper
on
the
floor
the
bottle
says
fe
fi
fo
fum
and
steams
and
shouts
some
more
o
sad
deceiving
ink
as
bad
as
liquor
in
its
way
all
demons
of
a
bottle
size
have
pranced
from
you
and
seized
my
pen
for
as
witches
ride
a
broom
and
left
a
trail
of
brimstone
words
and
blots
and
gobs
of
gloom
and
yet
when
i
am
extra
good
and
say
my
prayers
at
night
and
mind
my
ma
and
do
the
chores
and
speak
to
folks
polite
my
bottle
spreads
a
and
from
the
vapor
fine
ten
thousand
troops
from
fairyland
come
riding
in
a
line
i
seen
them
on
their
chargers
race
around
my
study
chair
they
opened
wide
the
window
and
rode
forth
upon
the
air
the
army
widened
as
it
went
and
into
myriads
grew
o
how
the
lances
shimmered
how
the
silvery
trumpets
blew
when
gassy
thompson
struck
it
rich
he
paid
a
swede
twelve
bits
an
hour
just
to
invent
a
fancy
style
to
spread
the
celebration
paint
so
it
would
show
at
least
a
mile
some
things
they
did
i
will
not
tell
they
not
quite
proper
for
a
rhyme
but
i
will
say
yim
yonson
swede
did
sure
invent
a
sunflower
time
one
thing
they
did
that
i
can
tell
and
not
offend
the
ladies
here
they
took
a
goat
to
simp
saloon
and
made
it
take
a
bath
in
beer
that
enterprise
took
management
they
broke
a
in
the
fray
but
mister
goat
was
bathed
all
right
and
simp
was
too
they
say
they
wore
girls
pink
straw
hats
to
church
and
clucked
like
hens
they
surely
did
they
bought
two
hotel
frying
pans
and
in
them
down
the
mountain
slid
they
went
to
denver
in
good
clothes
and
kept
burt
wide
awake
and
cut
about
like
and
ordered
steak
they
had
the
waiters
whirling
round
just
sweeping
up
the
smear
and
smash
they
tried
to
buy
the

they
showed
the

a
circle
on
a
long
ago
he
bounded
and
enclosed
it
with
angles
thus
and
so
his
set
of
solemn
greybeards
nodded
and
argued
much
of
arc
and
of
circumference
diameter
and
such
a
silent
child
stood
by
them
from
morning
until
noon
because
they
drew
such
charming
round
pictures
of
the
moon
ii
the
haughty
what
uncle
william
told
the
children
twelve
snails
went
walking
after
night
they
creep
an
inch
or
so
then
stop
and
bug
their
eyes
and
blow
some
folks
are
deadly
slow
twelve
snails
went
walking
yestereve
led
by
their
fat
old
king
they
were
so
dull
their
princeling
had
no
sceptre
robe
or
ring
only
a
paper
cap
to
wear
when
nightly
journeying
this
said
i
feel
a
thought
within
it
blossoms
soon
o
little
courtiers
of
mine
i
crave
a
pretty
boon
oh
yes
high
thoughts
with
effort
come
and
snails
are
almost
dumb
i
wish
i
had
a
yellow
crown
as
glistering
as
the
moon
iii
what
the
rattlesnake
said
the
moon
a
little
he
shivers
through
the
night
he
sits
upon
his
hill
and
cries
for
fear
that
will
bite
the
sun
a
broncho
he
afraid
like
every
other
thing
and
trembles
morning
noon
and
night
lest
should
spring
and
sting
iv
the
moon
the
north
wind
cooky
what
the
little
girl
said
the
moon
the
north
wind
cooky
he
bites
it
day
by
day
until
there
but
a
rim
of
scraps
that
crumble
all
away
the
south
wind
is
a
baker
he
kneads
clouds
in
his
den
and
bakes
a
crisp
new
moon
greedy
north
wind
eats
again
drying
their
wings
what
the
carpenter
said
the
moon
a
cottage
with
a
door
some
folks
can
see
it
plain
look
you
may
catch
a
glint
of
light
a
sparkle
through
the
pane
showing
the
place
is
brighter
still
within
though
bright
without
there
at
a
cosy
open
fire
strange
babes
are
grouped
about
the
children
of
the
wind
and
tide
the
urchins
of
the
sky
drying
their
wings
from
storms
and
things
so
they
again
can
fly
vi
what
the
fairy
said
the
moon
a
gong
hung
in
the
wild
whose
song
the
fays
hold
dear
of
course
you
do
not
hear
it
child
it
takes
a
fairy
ear
the
full
moon
is
a
splendid
gong
that
beats
as
night
grows
still
it
sounds
above
the
evening
song
of
dove
or
whippoorwill
vii
yet
gentle
will
the
griffin
be
what
grandpa
told
the
children
the
moon
it
is
a
griffin
egg
hatching
night
and
how
the
little
boys
will
watch
with
shouting
and
delight
to
see
him
break
the
shell
and
stretch
and
creep
across
the
sky
the
boys
will
laugh
the
little
girls
i
fear
may
hide
and
cry
yet
gentle
will
the
griffin
be
most
decorous
and
fat
and
walk
up
to
the
milky
way
and
lap
it
like
a
cat
second
section
the
moon
is
a
mirror
prologue
a
sense
of
humor
no
man
should
stand
before
the
moon
to
make
sweet
song
thereon
with
dandified
importance
his
sense
of
humor
gone
nay
let
us
don
the
motley
cap
the
jester
chastened
mien
if
we
would
woo
that
and
see
what
should
be
seen
o
mirror
on
fair
heaven
wall
we
find
there
what
we
bring
so
let
us
smile
in
honest
part
and
deck
our
souls
and
sing
yea
by
the
chastened
jest
alone
will
ghosts
and
terrors
pass
and
fays
or
suchlike
friendly
things
throw
kisses
through

ii
on
the
oh
once
i
walked
a
garden
in
dreams
was
yellow
grass
and
many
grew
there
in
sand
as
white
as
glass
the
curving
wide
was
marble
like
the
snow
i
walked
that
wall
a
and
pacing
quaint
and
slow
beside
me
were
my
pages
two
giant
friendly
birds
they
were
half
peacock
they
spake
in
their
inner
wings
a
chariot
their
outer
wings
for
flight
they
lifted
me
from
dreamland
we
bade
those
trees
swiftly
above
the
stars
we
rode
i
looked
below
me
soon
the
garden
i
had
ruled
was
one
lone
flower
the
moon
iii
written
for
a
musician
hungry
for
music
with
a
desperate
hunger
i
prowled
abroad
i
threaded
through
the
town
the
evening
crowd
was
clamoring
and
drinking
vulgar
and
pitiful
my
heart
bowed
down
till
i
remembered
duller
hours
made
noble
by
strangers
clad
in
some
surprising
grace
wait
wait
my
soul
your
music
comes
ere
midnight
appearing
in
some
unexpected
place
with
quivering
lips
and
gleaming
moonlit
face
iv
the
moon
is
a
painter
he
coveted
her
portrait
he
toiled
as
she
grew
gay
she
loved
to
see
him
labor
in
that
devoted
way
and
in
the
end
it
pleased
her
but
bowed
him
more
with
care
her
showed
so
plainly
her
was
not
there
that
night
he
groped
without
a
lamp
to
find
a
cloak
a
book
and
on
the
vexing
portrait
by
moonrise
chanced
to
look
the
was
out
of
key
the
maiden
faint
but
through
the
blessed
darkness
she
gleamed
his
friendly
saint
the
comrade
white
immortal
his
bride
and
more
than
bride
the
citizen
the
sage
of
mind
for
whom
he
lived
and
died
the
encyclopaedia
if
i
could
set
the
moon
upon
this
table
said
my
friend
among
the
standard
poets
and
brochures
without
end
and
noble
prints
of
old
japan
how
empty
they
would
seem
by
that
encyclopaedia
of
whim
and
glittering
dream
vi
what
the
miner
in
the
desert
said
the
moon
a
a
wondrous
if
i
could
climb
the
ridge
and
drink
and
give
drink
to
my
beast
if
i
could
drain
that
keg
the
flies
would
not
be
biting
so
my
burning
feet
be
spry
again
my
mule
no
longer
slow
and
i
could
rise
and
dig
for
ore
and
reach
my
fatherland
and
not
be
food
for
ants
and
hawks
and
perish
in
the
sand
vii
what
the
said
the
moon
an
open
furnace
door
where
all
can
see
the
blast
we
shovel
in
our
blackest
griefs
upon
that
grate
are
cast
our
aching
burdens
loves
and
fears
and
underneath
them
wait
paper
and
tar
and
pitch
and
pine
called
strife
and
blood
and
hate
out
of
it
all
there
comes
a
flame
a
splendid
widening
light
sorrow
is
turned
to
mystery
and
death
into
delight
viii
what
the
moon
saw
two
statesmen
met
by
moonlight
their
ease
was
partly
feigned
they
glanced
about
the
prairie
their
faces
were
constrained
in
various
ways
aforetime
they
had
misled
the
state
yet
did
it
so
politely
their
henchmen
thought
them
great
they
sat
beneath
a
hedge
and
spake
no
word
but
had
a
smoke
a
satchel
passed
from
hand
to
hand
next
day
the
deadlock
broke
ix
what
semiramis
said
the
moon
a
steaming
chalice
of
honey
and
a
little
of
it
sipped
by
night
makes
the
long
hours
divine
but
oh
my
reckless
lovers
they
drain
the
cup
and
wail
die
at
my
feet
with
shaking
limbs
and
tender
lips
all
pale
above
them
in
the
sky
it
bends
empty
and
gray
and
dread
night
is
full
again
golden
and
foaming
red
x
what
the
ghost
of
the
gambler
said
where
now
the
huts
are
empty
where
never
a
glows
in
an
abandoned
canyon
a
gambler
ghost
arose
he
muttered
there
the
moon
a
sack
of
dust
his
voice
rose
thin
i
wish
i
knew
the
i
play
and
play
to
win
in
every
game
in
of
old
when
stakes
were
high
i
held
my
own
now
i
would
play
for
that
sack
in
the
sky
the
sport
would
not
be
ended
there
rather
be
begun
i
bet
my
moon
against
his
stars
and
gamble
for
the
sun
xi
the
this
is
the
song
the
sings
hunger
and
fire
hunger
and
fire
beauty
spice
of
desire
under
the
watch
and
wait
burning
maidens
and
lads
that
mate
the
spreads
and
its
boughs
come
down
shadowing
village
and
farm
and
town
and
none
can
see
but
the
pure
of
heart
the
great
green
leaves
and
the
boughs
descending
and
hear
the
song
that
is
never
ending
the
deep
roots
whisper
the
branches
say
love
and
love
and
till
heaven
day
and
till
heaven
day
the
moon
is
a
bird
nest
in
its
branches
the
moon
is
hung
in
its
topmost
spaces
and
there
two
doves
play
house
while
lovers
watch
with
uplifted
faces
two
doves
go
home
to
their
nest
the
moon
it
is
woven
of
twigs
of
broken
light
with
threads
of
scarlet
and
threads
of
gray
and
a
lining
of
down
for
silk
delight
to
their
eden
the
moon
fly
home
our
doves
up
through
the
boughs
of
the

one
is
the
kiss
i
took
from
you
and
one
is
the
kiss
you
gave
to
me
xii
the
what
the
tramp
said
the
old
man
had
his
box
and
wheel
for
grinding
knives
and
shears
no
doubt
his
bell
in
village
streets
was
joy
to
children
ears
and
i
bethought
me
of
my
youth
when
such
men
came
around
and
times
i
asked
them
in
quite
sure
the
scissors
should
be
ground
the
old
man
turned
and
spoke
to
me
his
face
at
last
in
view
and
then
i
thought
those
curious
eyes
were
eyes
that
once
i
knew
the
moon
is
but
an
to
whet
the
sword
of
god
he
said
and
here
beside
my
fire
i
stretch
upon
the
sod
each
night
and
dream
and
watch
the
stars
and
watch
the
go
and
see
that
sword
of
god
in
heaven
to
and
fro
i
see
that
sword
each
century
friend
it
means
the
comes
with
all
its
bloody
wicked
chiefs
and
drums
men
talk
of
peace
but
i
have
seen
that
turn
round
the
voice
of
abel
cries
again
to
god
from
out
the
ground
the
ditches
must
flow
red
the
plague
go
stark
and
screaming
by
each
time
that
sword
of
god
takes
edge
within
the
midnight
sky
and
those
that
scorned
their
brothers
here
and
sowed
a
wind
of
shame
will
reap
the
whirlwind
as
of
old
and
face
relentless
flame
and
thus
the
spoke
his
face
at
last
in
view
there
beside
the
railroad
bridge
i
saw
the
wandering

my
lady
in
her
white

shawl
my
lady
in
her
white
silk
shawl
is
like
a
lily
dim
within
the
twilight
of
the
room
enthroned
and
kind
and
prim
my
lady
pale
gold
is
her
hair
until
she
smiles
her
face
is
pale
with
far
hellenic
moods
with
thoughts
that
find
no
place
in
our
harsh
village
of
the
west
wherein
she
lives
of
late
she
distant
as
stars
and
cold
almost
as
fate
but
when
she
smiles
she
here
again
rosy
with
a
puritan
bacchante
made
to
laugh
around
the

the

moon
herself
too

innocent

walks
at
midnight
in

illinois
it
is
portentous
and
a
thing
of
state
that
here
at
midnight
in
our
little
town
a
mourning
figure
walks
and
will
not
rest
near
the
old
pacing
up
and
down
or
by
his
homestead
or
in
shadowed
yards
he
lingers
where
his
children
used
to
play
or
through
the
market
on
the
stones
he
stalks
until
the
burn
away
a
bronzed
lank
man
his
suit
of
ancient
black
a
famous
high
and
plain
worn
shawl
make
him
the
quaint
great
figure
that
men
love
the
master
of

all
he
can
not
sleep
upon
his
hillside
now
he
is
among
us
as
in
times
before
and
we
who
toss
and
lie
awake
for
long
breathe
deep
and
start
to
see
him
pass
the
door
his
head
is
bowed
he
thinks
on
men
and
kings
yea
when
the
sick
world
cries
how
can
he
sleep
too
many
peasants
fight
they
know
not
why
too
many
homesteads
in
black
terror
weep
the
sins
of
all
the

his
heart
he
sees
the
dreadnaughts
scouring
every
main
he
carries
on
his
shoulders
now
the
bitterness
the
folly
and
the
pain
he
can
not

of
europe
free

of

earth
bringing
long

to

alp

breaks
his

that
kings
must
murder
still
that
all
his
hours
of
travail
here
for
men
seem
yet
in
vain
and
who
will
bring
white
peace
that

you
four
as

hand

returned
the
hate
of

once
more
to

walked
upon

the

if
you
with
words

stopped
these

conclave
ere
their

would
they
for

instant
then
discern
their
crime
their

should
float
above
the
battle

pillars
of
cloud
of
fire
that

not
slay
bearing
a

epilogue
under
the
blessing
of
your
psyche
wings
though
i
have
found
you
like
a
pale
on
sunny
days
have
found
you
weak
and
still
though
i
have
often
held
your
girlish
head
drooped
on
my
shoulder
faint
from
little
ill
under
the
blessing
of
your
i
hide
like
one
small
broken
bird
so
soothed
i
the
world
gone
mad
and
all
the
winds
of
war
are
now
unheard
my
pennons
feel
your
hands
with
touch
most
delicate
so
circling
round
that
for
an
hour
i
dream
that
god
is
good
and
in
your
shadow
mercy
ways
abound
i
thought
myself
the
guard
of
your
frail
state
and
yet
i
come
a
helpless
guest
hiding
beneath
your
giant
against
the
pallor
of
your
wondrous
breast
