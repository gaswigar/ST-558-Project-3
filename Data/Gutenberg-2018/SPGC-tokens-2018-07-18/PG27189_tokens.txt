the

men
who
are
separated
from
each

by
thousands
of
miles
hundreds
of
thousands
of
such
men
on

one
hand
buddhists
whose
law

killing
not
only
of
men
but
of
animals
on
the
other
hand
christians
professing
the
law
of
brotherhood
and
love
like
wild
beasts
on
land
and
on
sea
are
seeking
out
each
other
in
order
to
kill
torture
and
mutilate
each
other
in
the
most
cruel
way
what
can
this
be
is
it
a
dream
or
a
reality
something
is
taking
place
which
should
not
can
not
be
one
longs
to
believe
that
it
is
a
dream
and
to
awake
from
it
but
no
it
is
not
a
dream
it
is
a
dreadful
reality
one
could
yet
understand
how
a
poor
uneducated
defrauded
japanese
torn
from
his
field
and
taught
that
buddhism
consists
not
in
compassion
to
all
that
lives
but
in
sacrifices
to
idols
and
how
a
similar
poor
illiterate
fellow
from
the
neighborhood
of
toula
or
nijni
novgorod
who
has
been
taught
that
christianity
consists
in
worshipping
christ
the
madonna
saints
and
their
ikons
one
could
understand
how
these
unfortunate
men
brought
by
the
violence
and
deceit
of
centuries
to
recognize
the
greatest
crime
in
the
world
the
murder
of
one
brethren
as
a
virtuous
act
can
commit
these
dreadful
deeds
without
regarding
themselves
as
being
guilty
in
so
doing
but
how
can
enlightened
men
preach
war
support
it
participate
in
it
and
worst
of
all
without
suffering
the
dangers
of
war
themselves
incite
others
to
it
sending
their
unfortunate
defrauded
brothers
to
fight
these
enlightened
men
can
not
possibly
ignore
i
do
not
say
the
christian
law
if
they
recognize
themselves
to
be
christians
but
all
that
has
been
written
is
being
written
has
and
is
being
said
about
the
cruelty
futility
and
senselessness
of
war
they
are
regarded
as
enlightened
men
precisely
because
they
know
all
this
the
majority
of
them
have
themselves
written
and
spoken
about
this
not
to
mention
the
hague
conference
which
called
forth
universal
praise
or
all
the
books
pamphlets
newspaper
articles
and
speeches
demonstrating
the
possibility
of
the
solution
of
international
misunderstandings
by
international
arbitration
no
enlightened
man
can
help
knowing
that
the
universal
competition
in
the
armaments
of
states
must
inevitably
lead
them
to
endless
wars
or
to
a
general
bankruptcy
or
to
both
the
one
and
the
other
they
can
not
but
know
that
besides
the
senseless
purposeless
expenditure
of
milliards
of
roubles
of
human
labor
on
the
preparations
for
war
during
the
wars
themselves
millions
of
the
most
energetic
and
vigorous
men
perish
in
that
period
of
their
life
which
is
best
for
productive
labor
during
the
past
century
wars
have
destroyed
fourteen
million
men
enlightened
men
can
not
but
know
that
occasions
for
war
are
always
such
as
are
not
worth
not
only
one
human
life
but
not
one
hundredth
part
of
all
that
which
is
spent
upon
wars
in
fighting
for
the
emancipation
of
the
negroes
much
more
was
spent
than
it
would
have
cost
to
redeem
them
from
slavery
every
one
knows
and
can
not
help
knowing
that
above
all
wars
calling
forth
the
lowest
animal
passions
deprave
and
brutalize
men
every
one
knows
the
weakness
of
the
arguments
in
favor
of
war
such
as
were
brought
forward
by
de
maistre
moltke
and
others
for
they
are
all
founded
on
the
sophism
that
in
every
human
calamity
it
is
possible
to
find
an
advantageous
element
or
else
upon
the
utterly
arbitrary
assertion
that
wars
have
always
existed
and
therefore
always
must
exist
as
if
the
bad
actions
of
men
could
be
justified
by
the
advantages
or
the
usefulness
which
they
realize
or
by
the
consideration
that
they
have
been
committed
during
a
long
period
of
time
all
enlightened
men
know
all
this
then
suddenly
war
begins
and
all
this
is
instantly
forgotten
and
the
same
men
who
but
yesterday
were
proving
the
cruelty
futility
the
senselessness
of
wars
now
think
speak
and
write
only
about
killing
as
many
men
as
possible
about
ruining
and
destroying
the
greatest
possible
amount
of
the
productions
of
human
labor
and
about
exciting
as
much
as
possible
the
passion
of
hatred
in
those
peaceful
harmless
industrious
men
who
by
their
labor
feed
clothe
maintain
these
same
men
who
compel
them
to
commit
those
dreadful
deeds
contrary
to
their
conscience
welfare
or
faith
ii
something
is
taking
place
incomprehensible
and
impossible
in
its
cruelty
falsehood
and
stupidity
the
russian
tsar
the
same
man
who
exhorted
all
the
nations
in
the
cause
of
peace
publicly
announces
that
notwithstanding
all
his
efforts
to
maintain
the
peace
so
dear
to
his
heart
efforts
which
express
themselves
in
the
seizing
of
other
lands
and
in
the
strengthening
of
armies
for
the
defence
of
these
stolen
lands
he
owing
to
the
attack
of
the
japanese
commands
that
the
same
shall
be
done
to
the
japanese
as
they
had
commenced
doing
to
the
russians
that
they
should
be
slaughtered
and
in
announcing
this
call
to
murder
he
mentions
god
asking
the
divine
blessing
on
the
most
dreadful
crime
in
the
world
the
japanese
emperor
has
proclaimed
the
same
thing
in
relation
to
the
russians
men
of
science
and
of
law
messieurs
muravieff
and
martens
strenuously
try
to
prove
that
in
the
recent
call
of
all
nations
to
universal
peace
and
the
present
incitement
to
war
because
of
the
seizure
of
other
peoples
lands
there
is
no
contradiction
diplomatists
in
their
refined
french
language
publish
and
send
out
circulars
in
which
they
circumstantially
and
diligently
prove
though
they
know
no
one
believes
them
that
after
all
its
efforts
to
establish
peaceful
relations
in
reality
after
all
its
efforts
to
deceive
other
countries
the
russian
government
has
been
compelled
to
have
recourse
to
the
only
means
for
a
rational
solution
of
the
question
to
the
murder
of
men
the
same
thing
is
written
by
japanese
diplomatists
scientists
historians
and
philosophers
on
their
side
comparing
the
present
with
the
past
deduce
from
these
comparisons
profound
conclusions
and
argue
interminably
about
the
laws
of
the
movement
of
nations
about
the
relation
between
the
yellow
and
white
races
or
about
buddhism
and
christianity
and
on
the
basis
of
these
deductions
and
arguments
justify
the
slaughter
of
those
belonging
to
the
yellow
race
by
christians
while
in
the
same
way
the
japanese
scientists
and
philosophers
justify
the
slaughter
of
those
of
the
white
race
journalists
without
concealing
their
joy
try
to
outdo
each
other
and
not
hesitating
at
any
falsehood
however
impudent
and
transparent
prove
in
all
possible
ways
that
the
russians
only
are
right
and
strong
and
good
in
every
respect
and
that
all
the
japanese
are
wrong
and
weak
and
bad
in
every
respect
and
that
all
those
are
also
bad
who
are
inimical
or
may
become
inimical
toward
the
russians
the
english
the
americans
and
the
same
is
proved
likewise
by
the
japanese
and
their
supporters
in
relation
to
the
russians
not
to
mention
the
military
who
in
the
way
of
their
profession
prepare
for
murder
crowds
of
enlightened
people
such
as
professors
social
reformers
students
nobles
merchants
without
being
forced
thereto
by
anything
or
anybody
express
the
most
bitter
and
contemptuous
feelings
toward
the
japanese
the
english
or
the
americans
toward
whom
but
yesterday
they
were
either
or
indifferent
while
without
the
least
compulsion
they
express
the
most
abject
servile
feelings
toward
the
tsar
to
whom
to
say
the
least
they
were
completely
indifferent
assuring
him
of
their
unlimited
love
and
readiness
to
sacrifice
their
lives
in
his
interests
this
unfortunate
entangled
young
man
recognized
as
the
leader
of
one
hundred
and
thirty
millions
of
people
continually
deceived
and
compelled
to
contradict
himself
confidently
thanks
and
blesses
the
troops
whom
he
calls
his
own
for
murder
in
defence
of
lands
which
with
yet
less
right
he
also
calls
his
own
all
present
to
each
other
hideous
ikons
in
which
not
only
no
one
amongst
the
educated
believes
but
which
unlearned
peasants
are
beginning
to
abandon
all
bow
down
to
the
ground
before
these
ikons
kiss
them
and
pronounce
pompous
and
deceitful
speeches
in
which
no
one
really
believes
wealthy
people
contribute
insignificant
portions
of
their
immorally
acquired
riches
for
this
cause
of
murder
or
the
organization
of
help
in
connection
with
the
work
of
murder
while
the
poor
from
whom
the
government
annually
collects
two
milliards
deem
it
necessary
to
do
likewise
giving
their
mites
also
the
government
incites
and
encourages
crowds
of
idlers
who
walk
about
the
streets
with
the
tsar
portrait
singing
shouting
hurrah
and
who
under
pretext
of
patriotism
are
licensed
in
all
kinds
of
excess
all
over
russia
from
the
palace
to
the
remotest
village
the
pastors
of
churches
calling
themselves
christians
appeal
to
that
god
who
has
enjoined
love
to
one
enemies
to
the
god
of
love
himself
to
help
the
work
of
the
devil
to
further
the
slaughter
of
men
stupefied
by
prayers
sermons
exhortations
by
processions
pictures
and
newspapers
the
cannon
flesh
hundreds
of
thousands
of
men
uniformly
dressed
carrying
divers
deadly
weapons
leaving
their
parents
wives
children
with
hearts
of
agony
but
with
artificial
sprightliness
go
where
they
risking
their
own
lives
will
commit
the
most
dreadful
act
of
killing
men
whom
they
do
not
know
and
who
have
done
them
no
harm
and
they
are
followed
by
doctors
and
nurses
who
somehow
imagine
that
at
home
they
can
not
serve
simple
peaceful
suffering
people
but
can
only
serve
those
who
are
engaged
in
slaughtering
each
other
those
who
remain
at
home
are
gladdened
by
news
of
the
murder
of
men
and
when
they
learn
that
many
japanese
have
been
killed
they
thank
some
one
whom
they
call
god
all
this
is
not
only
regarded
as
the
manifestation
of
elevated
feeling
but
those
who
refrain
from
such
manifestations
if
they
endeavor
to
disabuse
men
are
deemed
traitors
and
betrayers
and
are
in
danger
of
being
abused
and
beaten
by
a
brutalized
crowd
which
in
defence
of
its
insanity
and
cruelty
can
possess
no
other
weapon
than
brute
force
iii
it
is
as
if
there
had
never
existed
either
voltaire
or
montaigne
or
pascal
or
swift
or
kant
or
spinoza
or
hundreds
of
other
writers
who
have
exposed
with
great
force
the
madness
and
futility
of
war
and
have
described
its
cruelty
immorality
and
savagery
and
above
all
it
is
as
if
there
had
never
existed
jesus
and
his
teaching
of
human
brotherhood
and
love
of
god
and
of
men
one
recalls
all
this
to
mind
and
looks
around
on
what
is
now
taking
place
and
one
experiences
horror
less
at
the
abominations
of
war
than
at
that
which
is
the
most
horrible
of
all
horrors
the
consciousness
of
the
impotency
of
human
reason
that
which
alone
distinguishes
man
from
the
animal
that
which
constitutes
his
merit
his
reason
is
found
to
be
an
unnecessary
and
not
only
a
useless
but
a
pernicious
addition
which
simply
impedes
action
like
a
bridle
fallen
from
a
horse
head
and
entangled
in
his
legs
and
only
irritating
him
it
is
comprehensible
that
a
heathen
a
greek
a
roman
even
a
mediæval
christian
ignorant
of
the
gospel
and
blindly
believing
all
the
prescriptions
of
the
church
might
fight
and
fighting
pride
himself
on
his
military
achievements
but
how
can
a
believing
christian
or
even
a
sceptic
involuntarily
permeated
by
the
christian
ideals
of
human
brotherhood
and
love
which
have
inspired
the
works
of
the
philosophers
moralists
and
artists
of
our
time
how
can
such
take
a
gun
or
stand
by
a
cannon
and
aim
at
a
crowd
of
his
desiring
to
kill
as
many
of
them
as
possible
the
assyrians
romans
or
greeks
might
be
persuaded
that
in
fighting
they
were
acting
not
only
according
to
their
conscience
but
even
fulfilling
a
righteous
deed
but
whether
we
wish
it
or
not
we
are
christians
and
however
christianity
may
have
been
distorted
its
general
spirit
can
not
but
lift
us
to
that
higher
plane
of
reason
whence
we
can
no
longer
refrain
from
feeling
with
our
whole
being
not
only
the
senselessness
and
the
cruelty
of
war
but
its
complete
opposition
to
all
that
we
regard
as
good
and
right
therefore
we
can
not
do
as
they
did
with
assurance
firmness
and
peace
and
without
a
consciousness
of
our
criminality
without
the
desperate
feeling
of
a
murderer
who
having
begun
to
kill
his
victim
and
feeling
in
the
depths
of
his
soul
the
guilt
of
his
act
proceeds
to
try
to
stupefy
or
infuriate
himself
to
be
able
the
better
to
complete
his
dreadful
deed
all
the
unnatural
feverish
insane
excitement
which
has
now
seized
the
idle
upper
ranks
of
russian
society
is
merely
the
symptom
of
their
recognition
of
the
criminality
of
the
work
which
is
being
done
all
these
insolent
mendacious
speeches
about
devotion
to
and
worship
of
the
monarch
about
readiness
to
sacrifice
life
or
one
should
say
other
people
lives
and
not
own
all
these
promises
to
defend
with
one
breast
land
which
does
not
belong
to
one
all
these
senseless
benedictions
of
each
other
with
various
banners
and
monstrous
ikons
all
these
all
these
preparations
of
blankets
and
bandages
all
these
detachments
of
nurses
all
these
contributions
to
the
fleet
and
to
the
red
cross
presented
to
the
government
whose
direct
duty
is
whilst
it
has
the
possibility
of
collecting
from
the
people
as
much
money
as
it
requires
having
declared
war
to
organize
the
necessary
fleet
and
necessary
means
for
attending
the
wounded
all
these
slavonic
pompous
senseless
and
blasphemous
prayers
the
utterance
of
which
in
various
towns
is
communicated
in
the
papers
as
important
news
all
these
processions
calls
for
the
national
hymn
cheers
all
this
dreadful
desperate
newspaper
mendacity
which
being
universal
does
not
fear
exposure
all
this
stupefaction
and
brutalization
which
has
now
taken
hold
of
russian
society
and
which
is
being
transmitted
by
degrees
also
to
the
masses
all
this
is
only
a
symptom
of
the
guilty
consciousness
of
that
dreadful
act
which
is
being
accomplished
spontaneous
feeling
tells
men
that
what
they
are
doing
should
not
be
but
as
the
murderer
who
has
begun
to
assassinate
his
victim
can
not
stop
so
also
russian
people
now
imagine
that
the
fact
of
the
deadly
work
having
been
commenced
is
an
unanswerable
argument
in
favor
of
war
war
has
been
begun
and
therefore
it
should
go
on
thus
it
seems
to
simple
benighted
unlearned
men
acting
under
the
influence
of
the
petty
passions
and
stupefaction
to
which
they
have
been
subjected
in
exactly
the
same
way
the
most
educated
men
of
our
time
argue
to
prove
that
man
does
not
possess
free
will
and
that
therefore
even
were
he
to
understand
that
the
work
he
has
commenced
is
evil
he
can
no
longer
cease
to
do
it
and
dazed
brutalized
men
continue
their
dreadful
work
iv
ask
a
soldier
a
private
a
corporal
a
officer
who
has
abandoned
his
old
parents
his
wife
his
children
why
he
is
preparing
to
kill
men
whom
he
does
not
know
he
will
at
first
be
astonished
at
your
question
he
is
a
soldier
he
has
taken
the
oath
and
it
is
his
duty
to
fulfil
the
orders
of
his
commanders
if
you
tell
him
that
war
the
slaughter
of
men
does
not
conform
to
the
command
thou
shalt
not
kill
he
will
say
and
how
if
ours
are
attacked
for
the
king
for
the
orthodox
faith
one
of
them
said
in
answer
to
my
question
and
how
if
he
attacks
that
which
is
sacred
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
why
said
he
the
banner
and
if
you
endeavor
to
explain
to
such
a
soldier
that
god
commandment
is
more
important
not
only
than
the
banner
but
than
anything
else
in
the
world
he
will
become
silent
or
he
will
get
angry
and
report
you
to
the
authorities
ask
an
officer
a
general
why
he
goes
to
the
war
he
will
tell
you
that
he
is
a
military
man
and
that
the
military
are
indispensable
for
the
defence
of
the
fatherland
as
to
murder
not
conforming
to
the
spirit
of
the
christian
law
this
does
not
trouble
him
as
either
he
does
not
believe
in
this
law
or
if
he
does
it
is
not
in
the
law
itself
but
in
that
explanation
which
has
been
given
to
this
law
but
above
all
he
like
the
soldier
in
place
of
the
personal
question
what
should
he
do
himself
always
put
the
general
question
about
the
state
or
the
fatherland
at
the
present
moment
when
the
fatherland
is
in
danger
one
should
act
and
not
argue
he
will
say
ask
the
diplomatists
who
by
their
deceits
prepare
wars
why
they
do
it
they
will
tell
you
that
the
object
of
their
activity
is
the
establishment
of
peace
between
nations
and
that
this
object
is
attained
not
by
ideal
unrealizable
theories
but
by
diplomatic
action
and
readiness
for
war
and
just
as
the
military
instead
of
the
question
concerning
one
own
action
place
the
general
question
so
also
diplomatists
will
speak
about
the
interests
of
russia
about
the
unscrupulousness
of
other
powers
about
the
balance
of
power
in
europe
but
not
about
their
own
position
and
its
activities
ask
the
journalists
why
by
their
writings
they
incite
men
to
war
they
will
say
that
wars
in
general
are
necessary
and
useful
especially
the
present
war
and
they
will
confirm
this
opinion
of
theirs
by
misty
patriotic
phrases
and
just
like
the
military
and
diplomatist
to
the
question
why
he
a
journalist
a
particular
individual
a
living
man
acts
in
a
certain
way
he
will
speak
about
the
general
interests
of
the
nation
about
the
state
civilization
the
white
race
in
the
same
way
all
those
who
prepare
war
will
explain
their
participation
in
that
work
they
will
perhaps
agree
that
it
would
be
desirable
to
abolish
war
but
at
present
this
is
impossible
at
present
they
as
russians
and
as
men
who
occupy
certain
positions
such
as
heads
of
the
nobility
representatives
of
local
doctors
workers
of
the
red
cross
are
called
upon
to
act
and
not
to
argue
there
is
no
time
to
argue
and
to
think
of
oneself
they
will
say
when
there
is
a
great
common
work
to
be
done
the
same
will
be
said
by
the
tsar
seemingly
responsible
for
the
whole
thing
he
like
the
soldier
will
be
astonished
at
the
question
whether
war
is
now
necessary
he
does
not
even
admit
the
idea
that
the
war
might
yet
be
arrested
he
will
say
that
he
can
not
refrain
from
fulfilling
that
which
is
demanded
of
him
by
the
whole
nation
that
although
he
does
recognize
that
war
is
a
great
evil
and
has
used
and
is
ready
to
use
all
possible
means
for
its
abolition
in
the
present
case
he
could
not
help
declaring
war
and
can
not
help
continuing
it
it
is
necessary
for
the
welfare
and
glory
of
russia
every
one
of
these
men
to
the
question
why
he
so
and
so
ivan
peter
nicholas
whilst
recognizing
as
binding
upon
him
the
christian
law
which
not
only
forbids
the
killing
of
one
neighbor
but
demands
that
one
should
love
him
serve
him
why
he
permits
himself
to
participate
in
war
in
violence
loot
murder
will
infallibly
answer
the
same
thing
that
he
is
thus
acting
in
the
name
of
his
fatherland
or
faith
or
oath
or
honor
or
civilization
or
the
future
welfare
of
the
whole
of
mankind
in
general
of
something
abstract
and
indefinite
moreover
these
men
are
always
so
urgently
occupied
either
by
preparation
for
war
or
by
its
organization
or
discussions
about
it
that
in
their
leisure
time
they
can
only
rest
from
their
labors
and
have
not
time
to
occupy
themselves
with
discussions
about
their
life
regarding
such
discussions
as
idle
v
men
of
our
christian
world
and
of
our
time
are
like
a
man
who
having
missed
the
right
turning
the
further
he
goes
the
more
he
becomes
convinced
that
he
is
going
the
wrong
way
yet
the
greater
his
doubts
the
quicker
and
the
more
desperately
does
he
hurry
on
consoling
himself
with
the
thought
that
he
will
arrive
somewhere
but
the
time
comes
when
it
becomes
quite
clear
that
the
way
along
which
he
is
going
will
lead
to
nothing
but
a
precipice
which
he
is
already
beginning
to
discern
before
him
in
such
a
position
stands
the
christian
humanity
of
our
time
it
is
perfectly
evident
that
if
we
continue
to
live
as
we
are
now
living
guided
in
our
private
lives
as
well
as
in
the
life
of
separate
states
by
the
sole
desire
of
welfare
for
ourselves
and
for
our
state
and
will
as
we
do
now
think
to
ensure
this
welfare
by
violence
then
inevitably
increasing
the
means
of
violence
of
one
against
the
other
and
of
state
against
state
we
shall
first
keep
subjecting
ourselves
more
and
more
transferring
the
major
portion
of
our
productiveness
to
armaments
and
secondly
by
killing
in
mutual
wars
the
best
physically
developed
men
we
must
become
more
and
more
degenerate
and
morally
depraved
that
this
will
be
the
case
if
we
do
not
alter
our
life
is
as
certain
as
it
is
mathematically
certain
that
two
straight
lines
must
meet
but
not
only
is
this
theoretically
certain
in
our
time
it
is
becoming
certain
not
only
to
thought
but
also
to
the
consciousness
the
precipice
which
we
approach
is
already
becoming
apparent
to
us
and
the
most
simple
and
uneducated
men
can
not
but
see
that
by
arming
ourselves
more
and
more
against
each
other
and
slaughtering
each
other
in
war
we
like
spiders
in
a
jar
can
come
to
nothing
else
but
the
destruction
of
each
other
a
sincere
serious
rational
man
can
no
longer
console
himself
by
the
thought
that
matters
can
be
mended
as
was
formerly
supposed
by
a
universal
empire
such
as
that
of
rome
or
of
charles
the
great
or
napoleon
or
by
the
mediæval
spiritual
power
of
the
pope
or
by
holy
alliances
by
the
political
balance
of
the
european
concert
and
by
peaceful
international
tribunals
or
as
some
have
thought
by
the
increase
of
military
strength
and
the
newly
discovered
powerful
weapons
of
destruction
it
is
impossible
to
organize
a
universal
empire
or
republic
consisting
of
european
states
as
different
nationalities
will
never
desire
to
unite
into
one
state
to
organize
international
tribunals
for
the
solution
of
international
disputes
but
who
will
impose
obedience
to
the
decision
of
the
tribunal
upon
a
contending
party
who
has
an
organized
army
of
millions
of
men
to
disarm
no
one
desires
it
or
will
begin
it
to
invent
yet
more
dreadful
means
of
destruction
balloons
with
bombs
filled
with
suffocating
gases
shells
which
men
will
shower
upon
each
other
from
above
whatever
may
be
invented
all
states
will
furnish
themselves
with
similar
weapons
of
destruction
and
cannon
flesh
as
after
cold
weapons
it
submitted
to
bullets
and
meekly
exposed
itself
to
shells
bombs
guns
mitrailleuses
mines
so
it
will
also
submit
to
bombs
charged
with
suffocating
gases
scattered
down
upon
it
from
balloons
nothing
shows
more
evidently
than
the
speeches
of
muravieff
and
professor
martens
about
the
japanese
war
not
contradicting
the
hague
peace
conference
nothing
shows
more
obviously
than
these
speeches
to
what
an
extent
amongst
the
men
of
our
time
the
means
for
the
transmission
of
thought
speech
is
distorted
and
how
the
capacity
for
clear
rational
thinking
is
completely
lost
thought
and
speech
are
used
for
the
purpose
not
of
serving
as
a
guide
for
human
activity
but
of
justifying
any
activity
however
criminal
it
may
be
the
late
boer
war
and
the
present
japanese
war
which
can
at
any
moment
pass
into
a
universal
slaughter
have
proved
this
beyond
all
doubt
all
discussions
can
as
little
contribute
to
the
cessation
of
war
as
the
most
eloquent
and
persuasive
considerations
addressed
to
fighting
dogs
as
to
its
being
more
advantageous
to
divide
the
piece
of
meat
over
which
they
are
struggling
than
to
mutilate
each
other
and
lose
the
piece
of
meat
which
will
be
carried
away
by
some
passing
dog
not
joining
in
the
fight
we
are
dashing
on
toward
the
precipice
can
not
stop
and
we
are
approaching
its
edge
for
every
rational
man
who
reflects
upon
the
position
in
which
humanity
is
now
placed
and
upon
that
which
it
is
inevitably
approaching
it
can
not
but
be
obvious
that
there
is
no
practical
issue
out
of
this
position
that
one
can
not
devise
any
combination
or
organization
which
would
save
us
from
the
destruction
toward
which
we
are
inevitably
rushing
not
to
mention
the
economical
problems
which
become
more
and
more
complex
those
mutual
relations
between
the
states
arming
themselves
against
each
other
and
at
any
moment
ready
to
break
out
into
wars
clearly
point
to
the
certain
destruction
toward
which
all
civilized
humanity
is
being
carried
then
what
is
to
be
done
vi
two
thousand
years
ago
john
the
baptist
and
then
jesus
said
to
men
the
time
is
fulfilled
and
the
kingdom
of
god
is
at
hand
μετανοεῖτε
bethink
yourselves
and
believe
in
the
gospel
mark
i
and
if
you
do
not
bethink
yourselves
you
will
all
perish
luke
xiii
but
men
did
not
listen
to
them
and
the
destruction
they
foretold
is
already
near
at
hand
and
we
men
of
our
time
can
not
but
see
it
we
are
already
perishing
and
therefore
we
can
not
leave
unheeded
that
old
in
time
but
for
us
new
means
of
salvation
we
can
not
but
see
that
besides
all
the
other
calamities
which
flow
from
our
bad
and
irrational
life
military
preparations
alone
and
the
wars
inevitably
growing
from
them
must
infallibly
destroy
us
we
can
not
but
see
that
all
the
means
of
escape
invented
by
men
from
these
evils
are
found
and
must
be
found
to
be
ineffectual
and
that
the
disastrous
position
of
the
nations
arming
themselves
against
each
other
can
not
but
go
on
advancing
continually
and
therefore
the
words
of
jesus
refer
to
us
and
our
time
more
than
to
any
time
or
to
any
one
jesus
said
bethink
yourselves
let
every
man
interrupt
the
work
he
has
begun
and
ask
himself
who
am
i
from
whence
have
i
appeared
and
in
what
consists
my
destiny
and
having
answered
these
questions
according
to
the
answer
decide
whether
that
which
thou
doest
is
in
conformity
with
thy
destiny
and
every
man
of
our
world
and
time
that
is
being
acquainted
with
the
essence
of
the
christian
teaching
needs
only
for
a
minute
to
interrupt
his
activity
to
forget
the
capacity
in
which
he
is
regarded
by
men
be
it
of
emperor
soldier
minister
or
journalist
and
seriously
ask
himself
who
he
is
and
what
is
his
destiny
in
order
to
begin
to
doubt
the
utility
lawfulness
and
reasonableness
of
his
actions
before
i
am
emperor
soldier
minister
or
journalist
must
say
to
himself
every
man
of
our
time
and
of
the
christian
world
before
any
of
these
i
am
a
man
an
organic
being
sent
by
the
higher
will
into
a
universe
infinite
in
time
and
space
in
order
after
staying
in
it
for
an
instant
to
die
to
disappear
from
it
and
therefore
all
those
personal
social
and
even
universal
human
aims
which
i
may
place
before
myself
and
which
are
placed
before
me
by
men
are
all
insignificant
owing
to
the
shortness
of
my
life
as
well
as
to
the
infiniteness
of
the
life
of
the
universe
and
should
be
subordinated
to
that
higher
aim
for
the
attainment
of
which
i
am
sent
into
the
world
this
ultimate
aim
owing
to
my
limitations
is
inaccessible
to
me
but
it
does
exist
as
there
must
be
a
purpose
in
all
that
exists
and
my
business
is
that
of
being
its
instrument
my
destiny
my
vocation
is
that
of
being
a
workman
of
god
of
fulfilling
his
work
and
having
understood
this
destiny
every
man
of
our
world
and
time
from
emperor
to
soldier
can
not
but
regard
differently
those
duties
which
he
has
taken
upon
himself
or
other
men
have
imposed
upon
him
before
i
was
crowned
recognized
as
emperor
must
the
emperor
say
to
himself
before
i
undertook
to
fulfil
the
duties
of
the
head
of
the
state
i
by
the
very
fact
that
i
live
have
promised
to
fulfil
that
which
is
demanded
of
me
by
the
higher
will
that
sent
me
into
life
these
demands
i
not
only
know
but
feel
in
my
heart
they
consist
as
it
is
expressed
in
the
christian
law
which
i
profess
in
that
i
should
submit
to
the
will
of
god
and
fulfil
that
which
it
requires
of
me
that
i
should
love
my
neighbor
serve
him
and
act
towards
him
as
i
would
wish
others
to
act
towards
me
am
i
doing
this
ruling
men
prescribing
violence
executions
and
the
most
dreadful
of
all
wars
men
tell
me
that
i
ought
to
do
this
but
god
says
that
i
ought
to
do
something
quite
different
and
therefore
however
much
i
may
be
told
that
as
the
head
of
the
state
i
must
direct
acts
of
violence
the
levying
of
taxes
executions
and
above
all
war
that
is
the
slaughter
of
one
neighbor
i
do
not
wish
to
and
can
not
do
these
things
so
must
say
to
himself
the
soldier
who
is
taught
that
he
must
kill
men
and
the
minister
who
deemed
it
his
duty
to
prepare
for
war
and
the
journalist
who
incited
to
war
and
every
man
who
puts
to
himself
the
question
who
is
he
what
is
his
destination
in
life
and
the
moment
the
head
of
the
state
will
cease
to
direct
war
the
soldier
to
fight
the
minister
to
prepare
means
for
war
the
journalist
to
incite
thereto
then
without
any
new
institutions
adaptations
balance
of
power
tribunals
there
will
of
itself
be
destroyed
that
hopeless
position
in
which
men
have
placed
themselves
not
only
in
relation
to
war
but
also
to
all
other
calamities
which
they
themselves
inflict
upon
themselves
so
that
however
strange
this
may
appear
the
most
effective
and
certain
deliverance
of
men
from
all
the
calamities
which
they
inflict
upon
themselves
and
from
the
most
dreadful
of
all
war
is
attainable
not
by
any
external
general
measures
but
merely
by
that
simple
appeal
to
the
consciousness
of
each
separate
man
which
nineteen
hundred
years
ago
was
proposed
by
jesus
that
every
man
bethink
himself
and
ask
himself
who
is
he
why
he
lives
and
what
he
should
and
should
not
do
vii
the
evil
from
which
men
of
our
time
are
suffering
is
produced
by
the
fact
that
the
majority
live
without
that
which
alone
affords
a
rational
guidance
for
human
activity
without
religion
not
that
religion
which
consists
in
belief
in
dogmas
in
the
fulfilment
of
rites
which
afford
a
pleasant
diversion
consolation
stimulant
but
that
religion
which
establishes
the
relation
of
man
to
the
all
to
god
and
therefore
gives
a
general
higher
direction
to
all
human
activity
and
without
which
people
stand
on
the
plane
of
animals
and
even
lower
than
they
this
evil
which
is
leading
men
to
inevitable
destruction
has
manifested
itself
with
special
power
in
our
time
because
having
lost
all
rational
guidance
in
life
and
having
directed
all
efforts
to
discoveries
and
improvements
principally
in
the
sphere
of
technical
knowledge
men
of
our
time
have
developed
in
themselves
enormous
power
over
the
forces
of
nature
but
not
having
any
guidance
for
the
rational
adaptation
of
this
power
they
naturally
have
used
it
for
the
satisfaction
of
their
lowest
and
most
animal
propensities
bereft
of
religion
men
possessing
enormous
power
over
the
forces
of
nature
are
like
children
to
whom
powder
or
explosive
gas
has
been
given
as
a
plaything
considering
this
power
which
men
of
our
time
possess
and
the
way
they
use
it
one
feels
that
considering
the
degree
of
their
moral
development
men
have
no
right
not
only
to
the
use
of
railways
steam
electricity
telephones
photography
wireless
telegraphs
but
even
to
the
simple
art
of
manufacturing
iron
and
steel
as
all
these
improvements
and
arts
they
use
only
for
the
satisfaction
of
their
lusts
for
amusement
dissipation
and
the
destruction
of
each
other
then
what
is
to
be
done
to
reject
all
these
improvements
of
life
all
this
power
acquired
by
humanity
to
forget
that
which
it
has
learnt
this
is
impossible
however
perniciously
these
mental
acquisitions
are
used
they
still
are
acquisitions
and
men
can
not
forget
them
to
alter
those
combinations
of
nations
which
have
been
formed
during
centuries
and
to
establish
new
ones
to
invent
such
new
institutions
as
would
hinder
the
minority
from
deceiving
and
exploiting
the
majority
to
disseminate
knowledge
all
this
has
been
tried
and
is
being
done
with
great
fervor
all
these
imaginary
methods
of
improvement
represent
the
chief
methods
of
and
of
diverting
one
attention
from
the
consciousness
of
inevitable
perdition
the
boundaries
of
states
are
changed
institutions
are
altered
knowledge
is
disseminated
but
within
other
boundaries
with
other
organizations
with
increased
knowledge
men
remain
the
same
beasts
ready
any
minute
to
tear
each
other
to
pieces
or
the
same
slaves
they
have
always
been
and
always
will
be
while
they
continue
to
be
guided
not
by
religious
consciousness
but
by
passions
theories
and
external
influences
man
has
no
choice
he
must
be
the
slave
of
the
most
unscrupulous
and
insolent
amongst
slaves
or
else
the
servant
of
god
because
for
man
there
is
only
one
way
of
being
free
by
uniting
his
will
with
the
will
of
god
people
bereft
of
religion
some
repudiating
religion
itself
others
recognizing
as
religion
those
external
monstrous
forms
which
have
superseded
it
and
guided
only
by
their
personal
lusts
fear
human
laws
and
above
all
by
mutual
hypnotism
can
not
cease
to
be
animals
or
slaves
and
no
external
efforts
can
extricate
them
from
this
state
for
only
religion
makes
a
man
free
and
most
of
the
people
of
our
time
are
deprived
of
it
viii
but
in
order
to
abolish
the
evil
from
which
we
are
suffering
those
will
say
who
are
preoccupied
by
various
practical
activities
it
would
be
necessary
that
not
a
few
men
only
but
all
men
should
bethink
themselves
and
that
having
done
so
they
should
uniformly
understand
the
destination
of
their
lives
in
the
fulfilment
of
the
will
of
god
and
in
the
service
of
one
neighbor
is
this
possible
not
only
possible
do
i
answer
but
it
is
impossible
that
this
should
not
take
place
it
is
impossible
for
men
not
to
bethink
themselves
impossible
that
each
man
should
not
put
to
himself
the
question
as
to
who
he
is
and
wherefore
he
lives
for
man
as
a
rational
being
can
not
live
without
seeking
to
know
why
he
lives
and
he
has
always
put
to
himself
this
question
and
always
according
to
the
degree
of
his
development
has
answered
it
in
his
religious
teaching
in
our
time
the
inner
contradiction
in
which
men
feel
themselves
elicits
this
question
with
special
insistence
and
demands
an
answer
it
is
impossible
for
men
of
our
time
to
answer
this
question
otherwise
than
by
recognizing
the
law
of
life
in
love
to
men
and
in
the
service
of
them
this
being
for
our
time
the
only
rational
answer
as
to
the
meaning
of
human
life
and
this
answer
nineteen
hundred
years
ago
has
been
expressed
in
the
christian
religion
and
is
likewise
known
to
the
vast
majority
of
all
mankind
this
answer
in
a
latent
state
lives
in
the
consciousness
of
all
men
of
the
christian
world
of
our
time
but
it
does
not
openly
express
itself
and
serve
as
guidance
for
our
life
only
because
on
the
one
hand
those
who
enjoy
the
greatest
authority
scientists
being
under
the
coarse
error
that
religion
is
a
temporary
and
outgrown
step
in
the
development
of
mankind
and
that
men
can
live
without
religion
inculcate
this
error
to
those
of
the
masses
who
are
beginning
to
be
educated
and
on
the
other
hand
because
those
in
power
sometimes
consciously
but
often
unconsciously
being
under
the
error
that
the
church
faith
is
christian
religion
endeavor
to
support
and
excite
in
the
people
crude
superstitions
given
out
as
the
christian
religion
if
only
these
two
deceptions
were
to
be
destroyed
then
true
religion
already
latent
in
men
of
our
time
would
become
evident
and
obligatory
to
bring
this
about
it
is
necessary
that
on
the
one
hand
men
of
science
should
understand
that
the
principle
of
the
brotherhood
of
all
men
and
the
rule
of
not
doing
unto
others
what
one
does
not
wish
for
oneself
is
not
one
casual
idea
out
of
a
multitude
of
human
theories
which
can
be
subordinated
to
any
other
considerations
but
is
an
incontestable
principle
standing
higher
than
the
rest
and
flowing
from
the
changeless
relation
of
man
to
that
which
is
eternal
to
god
and
is
religion
all
religion
and
therefore
always
obligatory
on
the
other
hand
it
is
necessary
that
those
who
consciously
or
unconsciously
preach
crude
superstitions
under
the
guise
of
christianity
should
understand
that
all
these
dogmas
sacraments
and
rites
which
they
support
and
preach
are
not
only
as
they
think
harmless
but
are
in
the
highest
degree
pernicious
concealing
from
men
that
central
religious
truth
which
is
expressed
in
the
fulfilment
of
god
will
in
the
service
of
men
and
that
the
rule
of
acting
toward
others
as
one
would
wish
others
to
act
toward
oneself
is
not
merely
one
of
the
prescriptions
of
the
christian
religion
but
is
the
whole
of
practical
religion
as
indeed
is
stated
in
the
gospels
to
bring
about
that
men
of
our
time
should
uniformly
place
before
themselves
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
life
and
uniformly
answer
it
it
is
only
necessary
that
those
who
regard
themselves
as
enlightened
should
cease
to
think
and
to
inculcate
to
other
generations
that
religion
is
atavism
the
survival
of
a
past
wild
state
and
that
for
the
good
life
of
men
the
spreading
of
education
is
sufficient
the
spread
of
the
most
varied
knowledge
which
is
in
some
way
to
bring
men
to
justice
and
to
a
moral
life
these
men
should
understand
instead
that
for
the
good
life
of
humanity
religion
is
vital
and
that
this
religion
already
exists
and
lives
in
the
consciousness
of
the
men
of
our
time
men
who
are
intentionally
and
unintentionally
stupefying
the
people
by
church
superstitions
should
cease
to
do
so
and
recognize
that
what
is
important
and
binding
in
christianity
is
not
baptism
nor
communion
nor
profession
of
dogmas
but
only
love
to
god
and
to
one
neighbor
and
the
fulfilling
of
the
commandment
of
acting
toward
others
as
one
wishes
others
to
act
toward
oneself
and
that
in
this
lies
all
the
law
and
the
prophets
if
only
both
and
men
of
science
understood
and
preached
to
children
and
to
the
uneducated
these
simple
clear
and
necessary
truths
as
they
now
preach
their
complicated
confused
and
unnecessary
theories
all
men
would
uniformly
understand
the
meaning
of
their
lives
and
recognize
one
and
the
same
duties
as
flowing
from
this
meaning
ix
but
how
are
we
to
act
now
immediately
among
ourselves
in
russia
at
this
moment
when
our
foes
have
already
attacked
us
are
killing
our
people
and
threatening
us
what
should
be
the
action
i
shall
be
asked
of
a
russian
soldier
officer
general
tsar
private
individual
are
we
forsooth
to
allow
our
enemies
to
ruin
our
possessions
to
seize
the
productions
of
our
labors
to
carry
away
prisoners
or
kill
our
men
what
are
we
to
do
now
that
this
thing
has
begun
but
before
the
work
of
war
was
commenced
by
whomsoever
it
was
commenced
every
awakened
man
must
answer
before
all
else
the
work
of
my
life
was
commenced
and
the
work
of
my
life
has
nothing
in
common
with
recognition
of
the
rights
of
the
chinese
japanese
or
russians
to
port
arthur
the
work
of
my
life
consists
in
fulfilling
the
will
of
him
who
sent
me
into
this
life
this
will
is
known
to
me
this
will
is
that
i
should
love
my
neighbor
and
serve
him
then
why
should
i
following
temporary
casual
irrational
and
cruel
demands
deviate
from
the
known
eternal
and
changeless
law
of
all
my
life
if
there
be
a
god
he
will
not
ask
me
when
i
die
which
may
happen
at
any
moment
whether
i
retained
with
its
timber
stores
or
port
arthur
or
even
that
conglomeration
which
is
called
the
russian
empire
which
he
did
not
confide
to
my
care
but
he
will
ask
me
what
i
have
done
with
that
life
which
he
put
at
my
disposal
did
i
use
it
for
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
predestined
and
under
the
conditions
for
fulfilling
which
it
was
intrusted
to
me
have
i
fulfilled
his
law
so
that
to
this
question
as
to
what
is
to
be
done
now
when
war
is
commenced
for
me
a
man
who
understands
his
destiny
whatever
position
i
may
occupy
there
can
be
no
other
answer
than
this
whatever
be
my
circumstances
whether
the
war
be
commenced
or
not
whether
thousands
of
russians
or
japanese
be
killed
whether
not
only
port
arthur
be
taken
but
petersburg
and
moscow
i
can
not
act
otherwise
than
as
god
demands
of
me
and
that
therefore
i
as
a
man
can
neither
directly
nor
indirectly
neither
by
directing
nor
by
helping
nor
by
inciting
to
it
participate
in
war
i
can
not
i
do
not
wish
to
and
i
will
not
what
will
happen
immediately
or
soon
from
my
ceasing
to
do
that
which
is
contrary
to
the
will
of
god
i
do
not
and
can
not
know
but
i
believe
that
from
the
fulfilment
of
the
will
of
god
there
can
follow
nothing
but
that
which
is
good
for
me
and
for
all
men
you
speak
with
horror
about
what
might
happen
if
we
russians
at
this
moment
ceased
to
fight
and
surrendered
to
the
japanese
what
they
desire
from
us
but
if
it
be
true
that
the
salvation
of
mankind
from
brutalization
and
lies
only
in
the
establishment
amongst
men
of
that
true
religion
which
demands
that
we
should
love
our
neighbor
and
serve
him
with
which
it
is
impossible
to
disagree
then
every
war
every
hour
of
war
and
my
participation
in
it
only
renders
more
difficult
and
distant
the
realization
of
this
only
possible
salvation
so
that
even
if
one
places
oneself
on
the
unstable
point
of
view
of
defining
actions
according
to
their
presumed
consequences
even
then
the
surrender
to
the
japanese
by
the
russians
of
all
which
the
former
desire
of
us
besides
the
unquestionable
advantage
of
the
cessation
of
ruin
and
slaughter
would
be
an
approach
to
the
only
means
of
the
salvation
of
mankind
from
destruction
whereas
the
continuance
of
the
war
however
it
may
end
will
be
a
postponement
of
that
only
means
of
salvation
yet
even
if
this
be
so
it
is
replied
wars
can
cease
only
when
all
men
or
the
majority
will
refuse
to
participate
in
them
but
the
refusal
of
one
man
whether
he
be
tsar
or
soldier
would
only
unnecessarily
and
without
the
slightest
profit
to
any
one
ruin
his
life
if
the
russian
tsar
were
now
to
throw
up
the
war
he
would
be
dethroned
perhaps
killed
in
order
to
get
rid
of
him
if
an
ordinary
man
were
to
refuse
military
service
he
would
be
sent
to
a
penal
battalion
and
perhaps
shot
why
then
without
the
slightest
use
should
one
throw
away
one
life
which
may
be
profitable
to
society
is
the
common
question
of
those
who
do
not
think
of
the
destination
of
their
life
and
therefore
do
not
understand
it
but
this
is
not
what
is
said
and
felt
by
any
man
who
understands
the
destination
of
his
life
by
any
religious
man
such
a
man
is
guided
in
his
activity
not
by
the
presumed
consequences
of
his
action
but
by
the
consciousness
of
the
destination
of
his
life
a
factory
workman
goes
to
his
factory
and
in
it
accomplishes
the
work
which
is
allotted
him
without
considering
what
will
be
the
consequences
of
his
labor
in
the
same
way
a
soldier
acts
carrying
out
the
will
of
his
commanders
so
acts
a
religious
man
in
fulfilling
the
work
prescribed
to
him
by
god
without
arguing
as
to
what
precisely
will
come
of
that
work
therefore
for
a
religious
man
there
is
no
question
as
to
whether
many
or
few
men
act
as
he
does
or
of
what
may
happen
to
him
if
he
does
that
which
he
should
do
he
knows
that
besides
life
and
death
nothing
can
happen
and
that
life
and
death
are
in
the
hands
of
god
whom
he
obeys
a
religious
man
acts
thus
and
not
otherwise
not
because
he
desires
to
act
thus
nor
because
it
is
advantageous
to
himself
or
to
other
men
but
because
believing
that
his
life
is
in
the
hands
of
god
he
can
not
act
otherwise
in
this
lies
the
distinction
of
the
activity
of
religious
men
and
therefore
it
is
that
the
salvation
of
men
from
the
calamities
which
they
inflict
upon
themselves
can
be
realized
only
in
that
degree
in
which
they
are
guided
in
their
lives
not
by
advantage
nor
arguments
but
by
religious
consciousness
x
but
how
about
the
enemies
that
attack
us
love
your
enemies
and
ye
will
have
none
is
said
in
the
teaching
of
the
twelve
apostles
this
answer
is
not
merely
words
as
those
may
imagine
who
are
accustomed
to
think
that
the
recommendation
of
love
to
one
enemies
is
something
hyperbolical
and
signifies
not
that
which
expressed
but
something
else
this
answer
is
the
indication
of
a
very
clear
and
definite
activity
and
of
its
consequences
to
love
one
enemies
the
japanese
the
chinese
those
yellow
people
toward
whom
benighted
men
are
now
endeavoring
to
excite
our
hatred
to
love
them
means
not
to
kill
them
for
the
purpose
of
having
the
right
of
poisoning
them
with
opium
as
did
the
english
not
to
kill
them
in
order
to
seize
their
land
as
was
done
by
the
french
the
russians
and
the
germans
not
to
bury
them
alive
in
punishment
for
injuring
roads
not
to
tie
them
together
by
their
hair
not
to
drown
them
in
their
river
amur
as
did
the
russians
a
disciple
is
not
above
his
master
it
is
enough
for
a
disciple
that
he
be
as
his
master
to
love
the
yellow
people
whom
we
call
our
foes
means
not
to
teach
them
under
the
name
of
christianity
absurd
superstitions
about
the
fall
of
man
redemption
resurrection
not
to
teach
them
the
art
of
deceiving
and
killing
others
but
to
teach
them
justice
unselfishness
compassion
love
and
that
not
by
words
but
by
the
example
of
our
own
good
life
and
what
have
we
been
doing
to
them
and
are
still
doing
if
we
did
indeed
love
our
enemies
if
even
now
we
began
to
love
our
enemies
the
japanese
we
would
have
no
enemy
therefore
however
strange
it
may
appear
to
those
occupied
with
military
plans
preparations
diplomatic
considerations
administrative
financial
economical
measures
revolutionary
socialistic
propaganda
and
various
unnecessary
sciences
by
which
they
think
to
save
mankind
from
its
calamities
the
deliverance
of
man
not
only
from
the
calamities
of
war
but
also
from
all
the
calamities
which
men
inflict
upon
themselves
will
take
place
not
through
emperors
or
kings
instituting
peace
alliances
not
through
those
who
would
dethrone
emperors
kings
or
restrain
them
by
constitutions
or
substitute
republics
for
monarchies
not
by
peace
conferences
not
by
the
realization
of
socialistic
programmes
not
by
victories
or
defeats
on
land
or
sea
not
by
libraries
or
universities
nor
by
those
futile
mental
exercises
which
are
now
called
science
but
only
by
there
being
more
and
more
of
those
simple
men
who
like
the
dukhobors
drojjin
olkhovik
in
russia
the
nazarenes
in
austria
condatier
in
france
tervey
in
holland
and
others
having
placed
as
their
object
not
external
alterations
of
life
but
the
closest
fulfilment
in
themselves
of
the
will
of
him
who
has
sent
them
into
life
will
direct
all
their
powers
to
this
realization
only
such
people
realizing
the
kingdom
of
god
in
themselves
in
their
souls
will
establish
without
directly
aiming
at
this
purpose
that
external
kingdom
of
god
which
every
human
soul
is
longing
for
salvation
will
come
to
pass
only
in
this
one
way
and
not
in
any
other
therefore
what
is
now
being
done
by
those
who
ruling
men
inspire
them
with
religious
and
patriotic
superstitions
exciting
in
them
exclusiveness
hatred
and
murder
as
well
as
by
those
who
for
the
purpose
of
freeing
men
from
slavery
and
oppression
invoke
them
to
violent
external
revolution
or
think
that
the
acquisition
by
men
of
very
much
incidental
and
for
the
most
part
unnecessary
information
will
of
itself
bring
them
to
a
good
life
all
this
by
distracting
men
from
what
alone
they
need
only
removes
them
further
from
the
possibility
of
salvation
the
evil
from
which
the
men
of
the
christian
world
suffer
is
that
they
have
temporarily
lost
religion
some
people
having
come
to
see
the
discord
between
the
existing
religion
and
the
degree
of
mental
and
scientific
development
attained
by
humanity
at
the
present
time
have
decided
that
in
general
no
religion
whatever
is
necessary
they
live
without
religion
and
preach
the
uselessness
of
any
religion
of
whatever
kind
others
holding
to
that
distorted
form
of
the
christian
religion
which
is
now
preached
likewise
live
without
religion
professing
empty
external
forms
which
can
not
serve
as
guidance
for
men
yet
a
religion
which
answers
to
the
demands
of
our
time
does
exist
and
is
known
to
all
men
and
in
a
latent
state
lives
in
the
hearts
of
men
of
the
christian
world
therefore
that
this
religion
should
become
evident
to
and
binding
upon
all
men
it
is
only
necessary
that
educated
men
the
leaders
of
the
masses
should
understand
that
religion
is
necessary
to
man
that
without
religion
men
can
not
live
a
good
life
and
that
what
they
call
science
can
not
replace
religion
and
that
those
in
power
and
who
support
the
old
empty
forms
of
religion
should
understand
that
what
they
support
and
preach
under
the
form
of
religion
is
not
only
not
religion
but
is
the
chief
obstacle
to
men
appropriating
the
true
religion
which
they
already
know
and
which
can
alone
deliver
them
from
their
calamities
so
that
the
only
certain
means
of
man
salvation
consists
merely
in
ceasing
to
do
that
which
hinders
men
from
assimilating
the
true
religion
which
already
lives
in
their
consciousness
xi
i
had
finished
this
writing
when
news
came
of
the
destruction
of
six
hundred
innocent
lives
opposite
port
arthur
it
would
seem
that
the
useless
suffering
and
death
of
these
unfortunate
deluded
men
who
have
needlessly
and
so
dreadfully
perished
ought
to
disabuse
those
who
were
the
cause
of
this
destruction
i
am
not
alluding
to
makaroff
and
other
officers
all
these
men
knew
what
they
were
doing
and
wherefore
and
they
voluntarily
for
personal
advantage
for
ambition
did
as
they
did
disguising
themselves
in
pretended
patriotism
a
pretence
not
condemned
merely
because
it
is
universal
i
allude
rather
to
those
unfortunate
men
drawn
from
all
parts
of
russia
who
by
the
help
of
religious
fraud
and
under
fear
of
punishment
have
been
torn
from
an
honest
reasonable
useful
laborious
family
life
driven
to
the
other
end
of
the
world
placed
on
a
cruel
senseless
machine
for
slaughter
and
torn
to
bits
drowned
along
with
this
stupid
machine
in
a
distant
sea
without
any
need
or
any
possibility
of
advantage
from
all
their
privations
efforts
and
sufferings
or
from
the
death
which
overtook
them
in
during
the
polish
war
the
adjutant
vilijinsky
sent
to
petersburg
by
klopitsky
in
a
conversation
held
in
french
with
dibitch
in
answer
to
the
latter
demand
that
the
russian
troops
should
enter
poland
said
to
him
monsieur
le
maréchal
i
think
that
in
that
case
it
will
be
quite
impossible
for
the
polish
nation
to
accept
this
manifesto
believe
me
the
emperor
will
make
no
further
concessions
then
i
foresee
that
unhappily
there
will
be
war
that
much
blood
will
be
shed
there
will
be
many
unfortunate
victims
do
not
think
so
at
most
there
will
be
ten
thousand
who
will
perish
on
both
sides
and
that
is
all
said
dibitch
in
his
german
accent
quite
confident
that
he
together
with
another
man
as
cruel
and
foreign
to
russian
and
polish
life
as
he
was
himself
nicholas
i
had
the
right
to
condemn
or
not
to
condemn
to
death
ten
or
a
hundred
thousand
russians
and
poles
vilijinsky
adds
on
his
own
behalf
the
did
not
then
think
that
more
than
sixty
thousand
russians
alone
would
perish
in
this
war
not
so
much
from
the
enemy
fire
as
from
disease
nor
that
he
would
himself
be
amongst
their
number
one
hardly
believes
that
this
could
have
been
so
senseless
and
dreadful
is
it
and
yet
it
was
sixty
thousand
maintainers
of
their
families
lost
their
lives
owing
to
the
will
of
those
men
and
now
the
same
thing
is
taking
place
in
order
not
to
let
the
japanese
into
manchuria
and
to
expel
them
from
korea
not
ten
thousand
but
fifty
and
more
thousands
will
according
to
all
probability
be
necessary
i
do
not
know
whether
nicholas
ii
and
kuropatkin
say
like
dibitch
in
so
many
words
that
not
more
than
fifty
thousand
lives
will
be
necessary
for
this
on
the
russian
side
alone
only
and
only
that
but
they
think
it
they
can
not
but
think
it
because
the
work
they
are
doing
speaks
for
itself
that
ceaseless
stream
of
unfortunate
deluded
russian
peasants
now
being
transported
by
thousands
to
the
far
east
these
are
those
same
not
more
than
fifty
thousand
live
russian
men
whom
nicholas
romanoff
and
alexis
kuropatkin
have
decided
they
may
get
killed
and
who
will
be
killed
in
support
of
those
stupidities
robberies
and
every
kind
of
abomination
which
were
accomplished
in
china
and
korea
by
immoral
ambitious
men
now
sitting
peacefully
in
their
palaces
and
expecting
new
glory
and
new
advantage
and
profit
from
the
slaughter
of
these
fifty
thousand
unfortunate
defrauded
russian
workingmen
guilty
of
nothing
and
gaining
nothing
by
their
sufferings
and
death
for
other
people
land
to
which
the
russians
have
no
right
which
has
been
criminally
seized
from
its
legitimate
owners
and
which
in
reality
is
not
even
necessary
to
the
russians
and
also
for
certain
dark
dealings
by
speculators
who
in
korea
wished
to
gain
money
out
of
other
people
forests
many
millions
of
money
are
spent
a
great
part
of
the
labor
of
the
whole
of
the
russian
people
while
the
future
generations
of
this
people
are
bound
by
debts
its
best
workmen
are
withdrawn
from
labor
and
scores
of
thousands
of
its
sons
are
mercilessly
doomed
to
death
and
the
destruction
of
these
unfortunate
men
is
already
begun
more
than
this
the
war
is
being
managed
by
those
who
have
hatched
it
so
badly
so
negligently
all
is
so
unexpected
so
unprepared
that
as
one
paper
admits
russia
chief
chance
of
success
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
possesses
inexhaustible
human
material
it
is
upon
this
that
those
rely
who
send
to
death
scores
of
thousands
of
russian
men
it
is
frankly
said
that
the
regrettable
reverses
of
our
fleet
must
be
compensated
on
the
land
in
plain
language
this
means
that
if
the
authorities
have
badly
directed
things
on
sea
and
by
their
negligence
have
destroyed
not
only
the
nation
millions
but
thousands
of
lives
we
can
make
it
up
by
condemning
to
death
on
land
several
more
scores
of
thousands
when
crawling
locusts
cross
rivers
it
happens
that
the
lower
layers
are
drowned
until
from
the
bodies
of
the
drowned
is
formed
a
bridge
over
which
the
upper
ranks
can
pass
in
the
same
way
are
the
russian
people
being
disposed
of
thus
the
first
lower
layer
is
already
beginning
to
drown
indicating
the
way
to
other
thousands
who
will
all
likewise
perish
and
are
the
originators
directors
and
supporters
of
this
dreadful
work
beginning
to
understand
their
sin
their
crime
not
in
the
least
they
are
quite
persuaded
that
they
have
fulfilled
and
are
fulfilling
their
duty
and
they
are
proud
of
their
activity
people
speak
of
the
loss
of
the
brave
makaroff
who
as
all
agree
was
able
to
kill
men
very
cleverly
they
deplore
the
loss
of
a
drowned
excellent
machine
of
slaughter
which
had
cost
so
many
millions
of
roubles
they
discuss
the
question
of
how
to
find
another
murderer
as
capable
as
the
poor
benighted
makaroff
they
invent
new
still
more
efficacious
tools
of
slaughter
and
all
the
guilty
men
engaged
in
this
dreadful
work
from
the
tsar
to
the
humblest
journalist
all
with
one
voice
call
for
new
insanities
new
cruelties
for
the
increase
of
brutality
and
hatred
of
one
makaroff
is
not
the
only
man
in
russia
and
every
admiral
placed
in
his
position
will
follow
in
his
steps
and
will
continue
the
plan
and
the
idea
of
makaroff
who
has
nobly
perished
in
the
strife
writes
the
let
us
earnestly
pray
god
for
those
who
have
laid
down
their
lives
for
the
sacred
fatherland
without
doubting
for
one
moment
that
the
fatherland
will
give
us
new
sons
equally
virtuous
for
the
further
struggle
and
will
find
in
them
an
inexhaustible
store
of
strength
for
a
worthy
completion
of
the
work
writes
the
petersburg
a
ripe
nation
will
draw
no
other
conclusion
from
the
defeat
however
unprecedented
than
that
we
should
continue
develop
and
conclude
the
strife
therefore
let
us
find
in
ourselves
new
strength
new
heroes
of
the
spirit
will
arise
writes
the
and
so
forth
so
murder
and
every
kind
of
crime
go
on
with
greater
fury
people
enthusiastically
admire
the
martial
spirit
of
the
volunteers
who
having
come
unexpectedly
upon
fifty
of
their
slay
all
of
them
or
take
possession
of
a
village
and
slaughter
all
its
population
or
hang
or
shoot
those
accused
of
being
spies
of
doing
the
very
same
thing
which
is
regarded
as
indispensable
and
is
constantly
done
on
our
side
news
about
these
crimes
is
reported
in
pompous
telegrams
to
their
chief
director
the
tsar
who
in
return
sends
to
his
virtuous
troops
his
blessing
on
the
continuation
of
such
deeds
is
it
not
evident
that
if
there
be
a
salvation
from
this
position
it
is
only
one
that
one
which
jesus
teaches
seek
ye
first
the
kingdom
of
god
and
his
righteousness
that
which
is
within
you
and
all
the
rest
all
that
practical
welfare
toward
which
man
is
striving
will
of
itself
be
realized
such
is
the
law
of
life
practical
welfare
is
attained
not
when
man
strives
toward
this
practical
welfare
such
striving
on
the
contrary
for
the
most
part
removes
man
from
the
attainment
of
what
he
seeks
but
only
when
man
without
thinking
of
the
attainment
of
practical
welfare
strives
toward
the
most
perfect
fulfilment
of
that
which
before
god
before
the
source
and
law
of
his
life
he
regards
as
right
then
only
incidentally
is
practical
welfare
also
attained
so
that
the
true
salvation
of
men
is
only
one
thing
the
fulfilment
of
the
will
of
god
by
each
individual
man
within
himself
in
that
portion
of
the
universe
which
alone
is
subject
to
his
power
in
this
is
the
chief
the
only
destiny
and
duty
of
every
individual
man
and
at
the
same
time
this
is
the
only
means
by
which
every
individual
man
can
influence
others
and
therefore
to
this
and
to
this
only
should
all
the
efforts
of
every
man
be
directed
may
xii
i
had
only
just
despatched
the
last
of
the
preceding
pages
of
this
paper
when
the
dreadful
news
came
of
a
new
iniquity
committed
in
regard
to
the
russian
people
by
those
men
who
crazed
with
power
have
appropriated
the
right
of
managing
them
again
coarse
and
servile
slaves
of
slaves
dressed
up
in
various
dazzling
attires
varieties
of
generals
wishing
to
distinguish
themselves
or
to
earn
the
right
to
add
one
more
little
star
fingle
fangle
or
scrap
of
ribbon
to
their
idiotic
glaring
or
else
from
stupidity
or
carelessness
again
these
miserable
men
have
destroyed
amid
dreadful
sufferings
thousands
of
those
honorable
kind
laborers
who
feed
them
and
again
this
iniquity
not
only
does
not
cause
those
responsible
for
it
to
reflect
and
repent
but
one
hears
and
reads
only
about
its
being
necessary
as
speedily
as
possible
to
mutilate
and
slaughter
a
greater
number
of
men
and
to
ruin
still
more
families
both
russian
and
japanese
more
than
this
to
prepare
men
for
fresh
iniquities
of
this
kind
the
perpetrators
of
these
crimes
far
from
recognizing
what
is
evident
to
all
viz
that
for
the
russians
this
event
even
from
their
patriotic
military
point
of
view
was
a
scandalous
defeat
endeavor
to
assure
credulous
people
that
these
unfortunate
russian
laboring
men
lured
into
a
trap
like
cattle
into
a
slaughterhouse
of
whom
several
thousands
have
been
killed
and
maimed
merely
because
one
general
did
not
understand
what
another
general
had
said
have
performed
an
act
of
heroism
because
those
who
could
not
run
away
were
killed
and
those
who
did
run
away
remained
alive
as
to
the
fact
that
one
of
these
immoral
and
cruel
men
distinguished
by
the
titles
of
generals
admirals
drowned
a
quantity
of
peaceful
japanese
this
is
also
described
as
a
great
and
glorious
act
of
heroism
which
must
gladden
the
hearts
of
russians
and
in
all
the
papers
are
reprinted
this
awful
appeal
to
murder
let
the
two
thousand
russian
soldiers
killed
on
the
yalu
together
with
the
maimed
and
her
sister
ships
with
our
lost
teach
our
cruisers
with
what
devastation
they
must
break
in
upon
the
shores
of
base
japan
she
has
sent
her
soldiers
to
shed
russian
blood
and
no
quarter
should
be
afforded
her
now
one
can
not
it
is
sinful
be
sentimental
we
must
fight
we
must
direct
such
heavy
blows
that
the
memory
of
them
shall
freeze
the
treacherous
hearts
of
the
japanese
now
is
the
time
for
the
cruisers
to
go
out
to
sea
to
reduce
to
ashes
the
towns
of
japan
flying
as
a
dreadful
calamity
along
its
shores
no
more
sentimentality
the
frightful
work
commenced
is
continued
loot
violence
murder
hypocrisy
theft
and
above
all
the
most
fearful
fraud
the
distortion
of
religious
teachings
both
christian
and
buddhistic
continue
the
tsar
the
chief
responsible
person
continues
to
review
the
troops
to
thank
reward
and
encourage
them
he
issues
an
edict
for
the
calling
out
of
the
reserves
his
faithful
subjects
again
and
again
lay
down
their
property
and
lives
at
the
feet
of
him
they
call
only
with
their
lips
their
adored
monarch
on
the
other
hand
desiring
to
distinguish
themselves
before
each
other
in
deeds
and
not
in
words
only
they
tear
away
the
fathers
and
the
from
their
orphaned
families
preparing
them
for
slaughter
the
worse
the
position
of
russia
the
more
recklessly
do
the
journalists
lie
transforming
shameful
defeats
into
victories
knowing
that
no
one
will
contradict
them
and
they
quietly
collect
money
from
subscriptions
and
sales
the
more
money
and
labor
of
the
people
is
devoted
to
the
war
the
more
is
grabbed
by
various
authorities
and
speculators
who
know
that
no
one
will
convict
them
because
every
one
is
doing
the
same
the
military
trained
for
murder
having
passed
years
in
a
school
of
inhumanity
coarseness
and
idleness
rejoice
poor
men
because
besides
an
increase
of
their
salary
the
slaughter
of
superiors
opens
vacancies
for
their
promotion
christian
pastors
continue
to
invite
men
to
the
greatest
of
crimes
continue
to
commit
sacrilege
praying
god
to
help
the
work
of
war
and
instead
of
condemning
they
justify
and
praise
that
pastor
who
with
the
cross
in
his
hands
on
the
very
scene
of
murder
encouraged
men
to
the
crime
the
same
thing
is
going
on
in
japan
the
benighted
japanese
go
in
for
murder
with
yet
greater
fervor
owing
to
their
victories
the
mikado
also
reviews
and
rewards
his
troops
various
generals
boast
of
their
bravery
imagining
that
having
learned
to
kill
they
have
acquired
enlightenment
so
too
groan
the
unfortunate
working
people
torn
from
useful
labor
and
from
their
families
so
their
journalists
also
lie
and
rejoice
over
their
gains
also
probably
for
where
murder
is
elevated
into
virtue
every
kind
of
vice
is
bound
to
flourish
also
probably
all
kinds
of
commanders
and
speculators
earn
money
and
japanese
theologians
and
religious
teachers
no
less
than
the
masters
in
the
techniques
of
armament
do
not
remain
behind
the
europeans
in
the
techniques
of
religious
deceit
and
sacrilege
but
distort
the
great
buddhistic
teaching
by
not
only
permitting
but
justifying
that
murder
which
buddha
forbade
the
buddhistic
scientist
ruling
over
eight
hundred
monasteries
explains
that
although
buddha
forbade
manslaughter
he
also
said
he
could
never
be
at
peace
until
all
beings
are
united
in
the
infinitely
loving
heart
of
all
things
and
that
therefore
in
order
to
bring
into
harmony
that
which
is
discordant
it
is
necessary
to
fight
and
to
kill
men
in
the
article
it
is
said
this
triple
world
is
my
own
possession
all
the
things
therein
are
my
own
children
the
ten
thousand
things
in
this
world
are
no
more
than
the
reflections
of
my
own
self
they
come
from
the
one
source
they
partake
of
the
one
body
therefore
i
can
not
rest
until
every
being
even
the
smallest
possible
fragment
of
existence
is
settled
down
to
its
proper
appointment
this
is
the
position
taken
by
the
buddha
and
we
his
humble
followers
are
but
to
walk
in
his
wake
why
then
do
we
fight
at
all
because
we
do
not
find
this
world
as
it
ought
to
be
because
there
are
here
so
many
perverted
creatures
so
many
wayward
thoughts
so
many
hearts
due
to
ignorant
subjectivity
for
this
reason
buddhists
are
never
tired
of
combating
all
productions
of
ignorance
and
their
fight
must
be
to
the
bitter
end
they
will
show
no
quarter
they
will
mercilessly
destroy
the
very
root
from
which
arises
the
misery
of
this
life
to
accomplish
this
end
they
will
never
be
afraid
of
sacrificing
their
lives
there
follow
just
as
is
usual
with
us
entangled
arguments
about
and
kindness
about
the
transmigration
of
souls
and
about
much
else
all
this
for
the
sole
purpose
of
concealing
the
simple
and
clear
commandment
of
buddha
not
to
kill
further
it
is
said
the
hand
that
is
raised
to
strike
and
the
eye
that
is
fixed
to
take
aim
do
not
belong
to
the
individual
but
are
the
instruments
utilized
by
a
principle
higher
than
transient
existence
the
open
court
may
buddhist
views
of
war
by
the
right
rev
it
is
as
if
there
never
had
existed
the
christian
and
buddhistic
teaching
about
the
unity
of
the
human
spirit
the
brotherhood
of
men
love
compassion
the
sacredness
of
human
life
men
both
japanese
and
russians
already
enlightened
by
the
truth
yet
like
wild
animals
nay
worse
than
wild
animals
throw
themselves
upon
each
other
with
the
sole
desire
to
destroy
as
many
lives
as
possible
thousands
of
unfortunates
groan
and
writhe
in
cruel
sufferings
and
die
in
agony
in
japanese
and
russian
field
hospitals
asking
themselves
in
bewilderment
why
this
fearful
thing
was
done
with
them
while
other
thousands
are
already
rotting
in
the
earth
or
on
the
earth
or
floating
in
the
sea
in
swollen
decomposition
and
scores
of
thousands
of
wives
fathers
mothers
children
are
bemoaning
their
uselessly
destroyed
yet
all
this
is
still
too
little
new
and
newer
victims
are
being
prepared
the
chief
concern
of
the
russian
organizers
of
slaughter
is
that
on
the
russian
side
the
stream
of
food
for
cannon
three
thousand
men
per
day
doomed
to
destruction
should
not
be
interrupted
for
one
minute
the
japanese
are
preoccupied
with
the
same
thing
the
locusts
are
incessantly
being
driven
down
into
the
river
in
order
that
the
rows
behind
may
pass
over
the
bodies
when
will
this
cease
and
the
deceived
people
at
last
recover
themselves
and
say
well
go
you
yourselves
you
heartless
tsars
mikados
ministers
bishops
priests
generals
editors
speculators
or
however
you
may
be
called
go
you
yourselves
under
these
shells
and
bullets
but
we
do
not
wish
to
go
and
we
will
not
go
leave
us
in
peace
to
plough
and
sow
and
build
and
also
to
feed
you
it
would
be
so
natural
to
say
this
now
when
amongst
us
in
russia
resounds
the
weeping
and
wailing
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
mothers
wives
and
children
from
whom
are
being
snatched
away
their
the
reserve
these
same
men
the
majority
of
the
reserve
are
able
to
read
they
know
what
the
far
east
is
they
know
that
war
is
going
on
not
for
anything
which
is
in
the
least
necessary
to
russia
but
for
some
dealings
in
strange
land
leased
lands
as
they
themselves
call
them
on
which
it
seemed
advantageous
to
some
corrupt
speculators
to
build
railways
and
so
gain
profit
also
they
know
or
might
know
that
they
will
be
killed
like
sheep
in
a
slaughterhouse
since
the
japanese
possess
the
latest
improvements
in
tools
of
murder
which
we
do
not
as
the
russian
authorities
who
are
sending
these
people
to
death
had
not
thought
in
time
of
furnishing
themselves
with
the
same
weapons
as
the
japanese
knowing
all
this
it
would
indeed
be
so
natural
to
say
go
you
those
who
have
brought
on
this
work
all
you
to
whom
war
is
necessary
and
who
justify
it
go
you
and
face
the
japanese
bullets
and
mines
but
we
will
not
go
because
we
not
only
do
not
need
to
do
this
but
we
can
not
understand
how
it
can
be
necessary
to
any
one
but
no
they
do
not
say
this
they
go
and
they
will
continue
to
go
they
can
not
but
go
as
long
as
they
fear
that
which
ruins
the
body
and
not
that
which
ruins
both
the
body
and
the
soul
whether
we
shall
be
killed
they
argue
or
maimed
in
these
chinnampos
or
whatever
they
are
called
whither
we
are
driven
we
do
not
know
it
yet
may
happen
that
we
shall
get
through
safely
and
moreover
with
rewards
and
glory
like
those
sailors
who
are
now
being
feasted
all
over
russia
because
the
japanese
bombs
and
bullets
did
not
hit
them
but
somebody
else
whereas
should
we
refuse
we
should
be
certainly
sent
to
prison
starved
beaten
exiled
to
the
province
of
yakoutsk
perhaps
even
killed
immediately
so
with
despair
in
their
hearts
leaving
behind
a
good
rational
life
leaving
their
wives
and
their
children
they
go
yesterday
i
met
a
reservist
soldier
accompanied
by
his
mother
and
wife
all
three
were
riding
in
a
cart
he
had
had
a
drop
too
much
his
face
was
swollen
with
tears
he
turned
to
me
to
thee
lyof
nikolaevitch
off
to
the
far
east
well
art
thou
going
to
fight
well
some
one
has
to
fight
no
one
need
fight
he
reflected
for
a
moment
but
what
is
one
to
do
where
can
one
escape
i
saw
that
he
had
understood
me
had
understood
that
the
work
to
which
he
was
being
sent
was
an
evil
work
where
can
one
escape
that
is
the
precise
expression
of
that
mental
condition
which
in
the
official
and
journalistic
world
is
translated
into
the
words
for
the
faith
the
tsar
and
the
fatherland
those
who
abandoning
their
hungry
families
go
to
suffering
to
death
say
as
they
feel
where
can
one
escape
whereas
those
who
sit
in
safety
in
their
luxurious
palaces
say
that
all
russian
men
are
ready
to
sacrifice
their
lives
for
their
adored
monarch
and
for
the
glory
and
greatness
of
russia
yesterday
from
a
peasant
i
know
i
received
two
letters
one
after
the
other
this
is
the
first
dear
lyof
nikolaevitch
well
i
have
received
the
official
announcement
of
my
call
to
the
service
i
must
present
myself
at
the
headquarters
that
is
all
and
after
that
to
the
far
east
to
meet
the
japanese
bullets
about
my
own
and
my
household
grief
i
will
not
tell
you
it
is
not
you
who
will
fail
to
understand
all
the
horror
of
my
position
and
the
horrors
of
war
all
this
you
have
long
ago
painfully
realized
and
you
understand
it
all
how
i
have
longed
to
visit
you
to
have
a
talk
with
you
i
had
written
to
you
a
long
letter
in
which
i
described
the
torments
of
my
soul
but
i
had
not
had
time
to
copy
it
when
i
received
my
summons
what
is
my
wife
to
do
now
with
her
four
children
as
an
old
man
of
course
you
can
not
do
anything
yourself
for
my
folks
but
you
might
ask
some
of
your
friends
in
their
leisure
to
visit
my
orphaned
family
i
beg
you
earnestly
that
if
my
wife
proves
unable
to
bear
the
agony
of
her
helplessness
with
her
burden
of
children
and
makes
up
her
mind
to
go
to
you
for
help
and
counsel
you
will
receive
and
console
her
although
she
does
not
know
you
personally
she
believes
in
your
word
and
that
means
much
i
was
not
able
to
resist
the
summons
but
i
say
beforehand
that
through
me
not
one
japanese
family
shall
be
orphaned
my
god
how
dreadful
is
all
this
how
distressing
and
painful
to
abandon
all
by
which
one
lives
and
in
which
one
is
concerned
the
second
letter
is
as
follows
kindest
lyof
nikolaevitch
only
one
day
of
actual
service
has
passed
and
i
have
already
lived
through
an
eternity
of
most
desperate
torments
from
in
the
morning
till
in
the
evening
we
have
been
crowded
and
knocked
about
to
and
fro
in
the
barrack
yard
like
a
herd
of
cattle
the
comedy
of
medical
examination
was
three
times
repeated
and
those
who
had
reported
themselves
ill
did
not
receive
even
ten
minutes
attention
before
they
were
marked
when
we
these
two
thousand
satisfactory
individuals
were
driven
from
the
military
commander
to
the
barracks
along
the
road
spread
out
for
almost
a
verst
stood
a
crowd
of
relatives
mothers
and
wives
with
infants
in
arms
and
if
you
had
only
heard
and
seen
how
they
clasped
their
fathers
husbands
sons
and
hanging
round
their
necks
wailed
hopelessly
generally
i
behave
in
a
reserved
way
and
can
restrain
my
feelings
but
i
could
not
hold
out
and
i
also
wept
in
journalistic
language
this
same
is
expressed
thus
the
upheaval
of
patriotic
feeling
is
immense
where
is
the
standard
that
can
measure
all
this
immensity
of
woe
now
spreading
itself
over
almost
of
the
world
and
we
we
are
now
that
food
for
cannon
which
in
the
near
future
will
be
offered
as
sacrifice
to
the
god
of
vengeance
and
horror
i
can
not
manage
to
establish
my
inner
balance
oh
how
i
execrate
myself
for
this
which
prevents
my
serving
one
master
and
god
this
man
does
not
yet
sufficiently
believe
that
what
destroys
the
body
is
not
dreadful
but
that
which
destroys
both
the
body
and
the
soul
therefore
he
can
not
refuse
to
go
yet
while
leaving
his
own
family
he
promises
beforehand
that
through
him
not
one
japanese
family
shall
be
orphaned
he
believes
in
the
chief
law
of
god
the
law
of
all
religions
to
act
toward
others
as
one
wishes
others
to
act
toward
oneself
of
such
men
more
or
less
consciously
recognizing
this
law
there
are
in
our
time
not
in
the
christian
world
alone
but
in
the
buddhistic
mahomedan
confucian
and
brahminic
world
not
only
thousands
but
millions
there
exist
true
heroes
not
those
who
are
now
being
fêted
because
having
wished
to
kill
others
they
were
not
killed
themselves
but
true
heroes
who
are
now
confined
in
prisons
and
in
the
province
of
yakoutsk
for
having
categorically
refused
to
enter
the
ranks
of
murderers
and
who
have
preferred
martyrdom
to
this
departure
from
the
law
of
jesus
there
are
also
such
as
he
who
writes
to
me
who
go
but
who
will
not
kill
but
also
that
majority
which
goes
without
thinking
and
endeavors
not
to
think
of
what
it
is
doing
still
in
the
depth
of
its
soul
does
now
already
feel
that
it
is
doing
an
evil
deed
by
obeying
authorities
who
tear
men
from
labor
and
from
their
families
and
send
them
to
needless
slaughter
of
men
repugnant
to
their
soul
and
their
faith
and
they
go
only
because
they
are
so
entangled
on
all
sides
that
where
can
one
escape
meanwhile
those
who
remain
at
home
not
only
feel
this
but
know
and
express
it
yesterday
in
the
high
road
i
met
some
peasants
returning
from
toula
one
of
them
was
reading
a
leaflet
as
he
walked
by
the
side
of
his
cart
i
asked
what
is
that
a
telegram
this
is
yesterday
but
here
is
one
of
he
took
another
out
of
his
pocket
we
stopped
i
read
it
you
should
have
seen
what
took
place
yesterday
at
the
station
he
said
it
was
dreadful
wives
children
more
than
a
thousand
of
them
weeping
they
surrounded
the
train
but
were
allowed
no
further
strangers
wept
looking
on
one
woman
from
toula
gasped
and
fell
down
dead
five
children
they
have
since
been
placed
in
various
institutions
but
the
father
was
driven
away
all
the
same
what
do
we
want
with
this
manchuria
or
whatever
it
is
called
there
is
sufficient
land
here
and
what
a
lot
of
people
and
of
property
has
been
destroyed
yes
the
relation
of
men
to
war
is
now
quite
different
from
that
which
formerly
existed
even
so
lately
as
the
year
that
which
is
now
taking
place
never
took
place
before
the
papers
set
forth
that
during
the
receptions
of
the
tsar
who
is
travelling
about
russia
for
the
purpose
of
hypnotizing
the
men
who
are
being
sent
to
murder
indescribable
enthusiasm
is
manifested
amongst
the
people
as
a
matter
of
fact
something
quite
different
is
being
manifested
from
all
sides
one
hears
reports
that
in
one
place
three
reservists
have
hanged
themselves
in
another
spot
two
more
in
yet
another
about
a
woman
whose
husband
had
been
taken
away
bringing
her
children
to
the
conscription
and
leaving
them
there
while
another
hanged
herself
in
the
yard
of
the
military
commander
all
are
dissatisfied
gloomy
exasperated
the
words
for
the
faith
the
king
and
the
fatherland
the
national
anthem
and
shouts
of
hurrah
no
longer
act
upon
people
as
they
once
did
another
warfare
of
a
different
kind
the
struggling
consciousness
of
the
deceit
and
sinfulness
of
the
work
to
which
people
are
being
called
is
more
and
more
taking
possession
of
the
people
yes
the
great
strife
of
our
time
is
not
that
now
taking
place
between
the
japanese
and
the
russians
nor
that
which
may
blaze
up
between
the
white
and
yellow
races
not
that
strife
which
is
carried
on
by
mines
bombs
bullets
but
that
spiritual
strife
which
without
ceasing
has
gone
on
and
is
now
going
on
between
the
enlightened
consciousness
of
mankind
now
waiting
for
manifestation
and
that
darkness
and
that
burden
which
surrounds
and
oppresses
mankind
in
his
own
time
jesus
yearned
in
expectation
and
said
i
came
to
cast
fire
upon
the
earth
and
how
i
wish
that
it
were
already
kindled
luke
xii
that
which
jesus
longed
for
is
being
accomplished
the
fire
is
being
kindled
then
do
not
let
us
check
it
but
let
us
spread
and
serve
it
may
i
should
never
finish
this
paper
if
i
were
to
continue
to
add
to
it
all
that
corroborates
its
essential
idea
yesterday
the
news
came
in
of
the
sinking
of
the
japanese
ironclads
and
in
the
higher
circles
of
russian
fashionable
rich
intellectual
society
they
are
without
the
slightest
conscientious
scruples
rejoicing
at
the
destruction
of
a
thousand
