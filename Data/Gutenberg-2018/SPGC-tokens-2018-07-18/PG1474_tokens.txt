the

chapter
i
the
commercial
traveller
a
personage
unknown
to
antiquity
is
one
of
the
striking
figures
created
by
the
manners
and
customs
of
our
present
epoch
may
he
not
in
some
conceivable
order
of
things
be
destined
to
mark
for
coming
philosophers
the
great
transition
which
welds
a
period
of
material
enterprise
to
the
period
of
intellectual
strength
our
century
will
bind
the
realm
of
isolated
power
abounding
as
it
does
in
creative
genius
to
the
realm
of
universal
but
levelling
might
equalizing
all
products
spreading
them
broadcast
among
the
masses
and
being
itself
controlled
by
the
principle
of
unity
the
final
expression
of
all
societies
do
we
not
find
the
dead
level
of
barbarism
succeeding
the
saturnalia
of
popular
thought
and
the
last
struggles
of
those
civilizations
which
accumulated
the
treasures
of
the
world
in
one
direction
the
commercial
traveller
is
he
not
to
the
realm
of
ideas
what
our
are
to
men
and
things
he
is
their
vehicle
he
sets
them
going
carries
them
along
rubs
them
up
with
one
another
he
takes
from
the
luminous
centre
a
handful
of
light
and
scatters
it
broadcast
among
the
drowsy
populations
of
the
duller
regions
this
human
pyrotechnic
is
a
scholar
without
learning
a
juggler
hoaxed
by
himself
an
unbelieving
priest
of
mysteries
and
dogmas
which
he
expounds
all
the
better
for
his
want
of
faith
curious
being
he
has
seen
everything
known
everything
and
is
up
in
all
the
ways
of
the
world
soaked
in
the
vices
of
paris
he
affects
to
be
the
of
the
provinces
he
is
the
link
which
connects
the
village
with
the
capital
though
essentially
he
is
neither
parisian
nor
provincial
he
is
a
traveller
he
sees
nothing
to
the
core
men
and
places
he
knows
by
their
names
as
for
things
he
looks
merely
at
their
surface
and
he
has
his
own
little
with
which
to
measure
them
his
glance
shoots
over
all
things
and
penetrates
none
he
occupies
himself
with
a
great
deal
yet
nothing
occupies
him
jester
and
jolly
fellow
he
keeps
on
good
terms
with
all
political
opinions
and
is
patriotic
to
the
bottom
of
his
soul
a
capital
mimic
he
knows
how
to
put
on
turn
and
turn
about
the
smiles
of
persuasion
satisfaction
and
or
drop
them
for
the
normal
expression
of
his
natural
man
he
is
compelled
to
be
an
observer
of
a
certain
sort
in
the
interests
of
his
trade
he
must
probe
men
with
a
glance
and
guess
their
habits
wants
and
above
all
their
solvency
to
economize
time
he
must
come
to
quick
decisions
as
to
his
chances
of
success
a
practice
that
makes
him
more
or
less
a
man
of
judgment
on
the
strength
of
which
he
sets
up
as
a
judge
of
theatres
and
discourses
about
those
of
paris
and
the
provinces
he
knows
all
the
good
and
bad
haunts
in
france
de
actu
et
he
can
pilot
you
on
occasion
to
vice
or
virtue
with
equal
assurance
blest
with
the
eloquence
of
a
spigot
turned
on
at
will
he
can
check
or
let
run
without
floundering
the
collection
of
phrases
which
he
keeps
on
tap
and
which
produce
upon
his
victims
the
effect
of
a
moral
loquacious
as
a
cricket
he
smokes
drinks
wears
a
profusion
of
trinkets
overawes
the
common
people
passes
for
a
lord
in
the
villages
and
never
permits
himself
to
be
stumped
a
slang
expression
all
his
own
he
knows
how
to
slap
his
pockets
at
the
right
time
and
make
his
money
jingle
if
he
thinks
the
servants
of
the
houses
which
he
wants
to
enter
always
eminently
suspicious
are
likely
to
take
him
for
a
thief
activity
is
not
the
least
surprising
quality
of
this
human
machine
not
the
hawk
swooping
upon
its
prey
not
the
stag
doubling
before
the
huntsman
and
the
hounds
nor
the
hounds
themselves
catching
scent
of
the
game
can
be
compared
with
him
for
the
rapidity
of
his
dart
when
he
spies
a
commission
for
the
agility
with
which
he
trips
up
a
rival
and
gets
ahead
of
him
for
the
keenness
of
his
scent
as
he
noses
a
customer
and
discovers
the
sport
where
he
can
get
off
his
wares
how
many
great
qualities
must
such
a
man
possess
you
will
find
in
all
countries
many
such
diplomats
of
low
degree
consummate
negotiators
arguing
in
the
interests
of
calico
jewels
frippery
wines
and
often
displaying
more
true
diplomacy
than
ambassadors
themselves
who
for
the
most
part
know
only
the
forms
of
it
no
one
in
france
can
doubt
the
powers
of
the
commercial
traveller
that
intrepid
soul
who
dares
all
and
boldly
brings
the
genius
of
civilization
and
the
modern
inventions
of
paris
into
a
struggle
with
the
plain
commonsense
of
remote
villages
and
the
ignorant
and
boorish
treadmill
of
provincial
ways
can
we
ever
forget
the
skilful
manoeuvres
by
which
he
worms
himself
into
the
minds
of
the
populace
bringing
a
volume
of
words
to
bear
upon
the
refractory
reminding
us
of
the
indefatigable
worker
in
marbles
whose
file
eats
slowly
into
a
block
of
porphyry
would
you
seek
to
know
the
utmost
power
of
language
or
the
strongest
pressure
that
a
phrase
can
bring
to
bear
against
rebellious
lucre
against
the
miserly
proprietor
squatting
in
the
recesses
of
his
country
lair
listen
to
one
of
these
great
ambassadors
of
parisian
industry
as
he
revolves
and
works
and
sucks
like
an
intelligent
piston
of
the
called
speculation
monsieur
said
a
wise
political
economist
the
and
of
a
celebrated
company
out
of
every
five
hundred
thousand
francs
of
policies
to
be
renewed
in
the
provinces
not
more
than
fifty
thousand
are
paid
up
voluntarily
the
other
four
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
are
got
in
by
the
activity
of
our
agents
who
go
about
among
those
who
are
in
arrears
and
worry
them
with
stories
of
horrible
incendiaries
until
they
are
driven
to
sign
the
new
policies
thus
you
see
that
eloquence
the
labial
flux
is
nine
tenths
of
the
ways
and
means
of
our
to
talk
to
make
people
listen
to
you
that
is
seduction
in
itself
a
nation
that
has
two
chambers
a
woman
who
lends
both
ears
are
soon
lost
eve
and
her
serpent
are
the
everlasting
myth
of
an
hourly
fact
which
began
and
may
end
with
the
world
itself
a
conversation
of
two
hours
ought
to
capture
your
man
said
a
retired
lawyer
let
us
walk
round
the
commercial
traveller
and
look
at
him
well
don
t
forget
his
overcoat
olive
green
nor
his
cloak
with
its
morocco
collar
nor
the
striped
blue
cotton
shirt
in
this
queer
figure
so
original
that
we
can
not
rub
it
out
how
many
divers
personalities
we
come
across
in
the
first
place
what
an
acrobat
what
a
circus
what
a
battery
all
in
one
is
the
man
himself
his
vocation
and
his
tongue
intrepid
mariner
he
plunges
in
armed
with
a
few
phrases
to
catch
five
or
six
thousand
francs
in
the
frozen
seas
in
the
domain
of
the
red
indians
who
inhabit
the
interior
of
france
the
provincial
fish
will
not
rise
to
harpoons
and
torches
it
can
only
be
taken
with
seines
and
nets
and
gentlest
persuasions
the
traveller
s
business
is
to
extract
the
gold
in
country
caches
by
a
purely
intellectual
operation
and
to
extract
it
pleasantly
and
without
pain
can
you
think
without
a
shudder
of
the
flood
of
phrases
which
day
by
day
renewed
each
dawn
leaps
in
cascades
the
length
and
breadth
of
sunny
france
you
know
the
species
let
us
now
take
a
look
at
the
individual
there
lives
in
paris
an
incomparable
commercial
traveller
the
paragon
of
his
race
a
man
who
possesses
in
the
highest
degree
all
the
qualifications
necessary
to
the
nature
of
his
success
his
speech
is
vitriol
and
likewise
glue
glue
to
catch
and
entangle
his
victim
and
make
him
sticky
and
easy
to
grip
vitriol
to
dissolve
hard
heads
close
fists
and
closer
calculations
his
line
was
once
the
but
his
talents
and
the
art
with
which
he
snared
the
wariest
provincial
had
brought
him
such
commercial
celebrity
that
all
vendors
of
the
article
paris
paid
court
to
him
and
humbly
begged
that
he
would
deign
to
take
their
commissions
article
paris
means
anything
especially
articles
of
wearing
apparel
which
originates
or
is
made
in
paris
the
name
is
supposed
to
give
to
the
thing
a
special
value
in
the
provinces
thus
when
he
returned
to
paris
in
the
intervals
of
his
triumphant
progress
through
france
he
lived
a
life
of
perpetual
festivity
in
the
shape
of
weddings
and
suppers
when
he
was
in
the
provinces
the
correspondents
in
the
smaller
towns
made
much
of
him
in
paris
the
great
houses
feted
and
caressed
him
welcomed
flattered
and
fed
wherever
he
went
it
came
to
pass
that
to
breakfast
or
to
dine
alone
was
a
novelty
an
event
he
lived
the
life
of
a
sovereign
or
better
still
of
a
journalist
in
fact
he
was
the
perambulating
feuilleton
of
parisian
commerce
his
name
was
gaudissart
and
his
renown
his
vogue
the
flatteries
showered
upon
him
were
such
as
to
win
for
him
the
surname
of
illustrious
wherever
the
fellow
went
behind
a
counter
or
before
a
bar
into
a
salon
or
to
the
top
of
a
up
to
a
garret
or
to
dine
with
a
banker
every
one
said
the
moment
they
saw
him
ah
here
comes
the
illustrious
gaudissart
no
name
was
ever
so
in
keeping
with
the
style
the
manners
the
countenance
the
voice
the
language
of
any
man
all
things
smiled
upon
our
traveller
and
the
traveller
smiled
back
in
return
similia
similibus
he
believed
in
homoeopathy
puns
monkish
face
skin
of
a
friar
true
rabelaisian
exterior
clothing
body
mind
and
features
all
pulled
together
to
put
a
jollity
into
every
inch
of
his
person
and
he
might
be
recognized
at
once
as
the
favorite
of
grisettes
the
man
who
jumps
lightly
to
the
top
of
a
gives
a
hand
to
the
timid
lady
who
fears
to
step
down
jokes
with
the
postillion
about
his
neckerchief
and
contrives
to
sell
him
a
cap
smiles
at
the
maid
and
catches
her
round
the
waist
or
by
the
heart
gurgles
at
dinner
like
a
bottle
of
wine
and
pretends
to
draw
the
cork
by
sounding
a
filip
on
his
distended
cheek
plays
a
tune
with
his
knife
on
the
champagne
glasses
without
breaking
them
and
says
to
the
company
let
me
see
you
do
chaffs
the
timid
traveller
contradicts
the
knowing
one
lords
it
over
a
and
manages
to
get
the
titbits
for
himself
a
strong
fellow
nevertheless
he
can
throw
aside
all
this
nonsense
and
mean
business
when
he
flings
away
the
stump
of
his
cigar
and
says
with
a
glance
at
some
town
i
ll
go
and
see
what
those
people
have
got
in
their
se
gaudir
to
enjoy
to
make
fun
gaudriole
gay
discourse
rather
littre
when
buckled
down
to
his
work
he
became
the
slyest
and
cleverest
of
diplomats
all
things
to
all
men
he
knew
how
to
accost
a
banker
like
a
capitalist
a
magistrate
like
a
functionary
a
royalist
with
pious
and
monarchical
sentiments
a
bourgeois
as
one
of
themselves
in
short
wherever
he
was
he
was
just
what
he
ought
to
be
he
left
gaudissart
at
the
door
when
he
went
in
and
picked
him
up
when
he
came
out
until
the
illustrious
gaudissart
was
faithful
to
the
article
paris
in
his
close
relation
to
the
caprices
of
humanity
the
varied
paths
of
commerce
had
enabled
him
to
observe
the
windings
of
the
heart
of
man
he
had
learned
the
secret
of
persuasive
eloquence
the
knack
of
loosening
the
tightest
the
art
of
rousing
desire
in
the
souls
of
husbands
wives
children
and
servants
and
what
is
more
he
knew
how
to
satisfy
it
no
one
had
greater
faculty
than
he
for
inveigling
a
merchant
by
the
charms
of
a
bargain
and
disappearing
at
the
instant
when
desire
had
reached
its
crisis
full
of
gratitude
to
the
trade
he
always
declared
that
it
was
his
efforts
in
behalf
of
the
exterior
of
the
human
head
which
had
enabled
him
to
understand
its
interior
he
had
capped
and
crowned
so
many
people
he
was
always
flinging
himself
at
their
heads
etc
his
jokes
about
hats
and
heads
were
irrepressible
though
perhaps
not
dazzling
nevertheless
after
august
and
october
he
abandoned
the
hat
trade
and
the
article
paris
and
tore
himself
from
things
mechanical
and
visible
to
mount
into
the
higher
spheres
of
parisian
speculation
he
forsook
to
use
his
own
words
matter
for
mind
manufactured
products
for
the
infinitely
purer
elaborations
of
human
this
requires
some
explanation
the
general
upset
of
brought
to
birth
as
everybody
knows
a
number
of
old
ideas
which
clever
speculators
tried
to
pass
off
in
new
bodies
after
ideas
became
property
a
writer
too
wise
to
publish
his
writings
once
remarked
that
more
ideas
are
stolen
than
perhaps
in
course
of
time
we
may
have
an
exchange
for
thought
in
fact
even
now
ideas
good
or
bad
have
their
consols
are
bought
up
imported
exported
sold
and
quoted
like
stocks
if
ideas
are
not
on
hand
ready
for
sale
speculators
try
to
pass
off
words
in
their
stead
and
actually
live
upon
them
as
a
bird
lives
on
the
seeds
of
his
millet
pray
do
not
laugh
a
word
is
worth
quite
as
much
as
an
idea
in
a
land
where
the
ticket
on
a
sack
is
of
more
importance
than
the
contents
have
we
not
seen
libraries
working
off
the
word
picturesque
when
literature
would
have
cut
the
throat
of
the
word
fantastic
fiscal
genius
has
guessed
the
proper
tax
on
intellect
it
has
accurately
estimated
the
profits
of
advertising
it
has
registered
a
prospectus
of
the
quantity
and
exact
value
of
the
property
weighing
its
thought
at
the
intellectual
stamp
office
in
the
rue
de
la
paix
having
become
an
article
of
commerce
intellect
and
all
its
products
must
naturally
obey
the
laws
which
bind
other
manufacturing
interests
thus
it
often
happens
that
ideas
conceived
in
their
cups
by
certain
apparently
idle
parisians
who
nevertheless
fight
many
a
moral
battle
over
their
champagne
and
their
pheasants
are
handed
down
at
their
birth
from
the
brain
to
the
commercial
travellers
who
are
employed
to
spread
them
discreetly
urbi
et
orbi
through
paris
and
the
provinces
seasoned
with
the
fried
pork
of
advertisement
and
prospectus
by
means
of
which
they
catch
in
their
the
departmental
rodent

called

sometimes

occasionally
corresponding

or
patron
but
invariably

i
am
a
fool
many
a
poor
country
proprietor
has
said
when
caught
by
the
prospect
of
being
the
first
to
launch
a
new
idea
he
finds
that
he
has
in
point
of
fact
launched
his
thousand
or
twelve
hundred
francs
into
a
gulf
subscribers
are
fools
who
never
can
be
brought
to
understand
that
to
go
ahead
in
the
intellectual
world
they
must
start
with
more
money
than
they
need
for
the
tour
of
europe
say
the
speculators
consequently
there
is
endless
warfare
between
the
recalcitrant
public
which
refuses
to
pay
the
parisian
imposts
and
the
who
living
by
his
receipt
of
custom
lards
the
public
with
new
ideas
turns
it
on
the
spit
of
lively
projects
roasts
it
with
prospectuses
basting
all
the
while
with
flattery
and
finally
gobbles
it
up
with
some
toothsome
sauce
in
which
it
is
caught
and
intoxicated
like
a
fly
with
a
moreover
since
what
honors
and
emoluments
have
been
scattered
throughout
france
to
stimulate
the
zeal
and
of
the
progressive
and
intelligent
masses
titles
medals
diplomas
a
sort
of
legion
of
honor
invented
for
the
army
of
martyrs
have
followed
each
other
with
marvellous
rapidity
speculators
in
the
manufactured
products
of
the
intellect
have
developed
a
spice
a
ginger
all
their
own
from
this
have
come
premiums
forestalled
dividends
and
that
conscription
of
noted
names
which
is
levied
without
the
knowledge
of
the
unfortunate
writers
who
bear
them
and
who
thus
find
themselves
actual
in
more
enterprises
than
there
are
days
in
the
year
for
the
law
we
may
remark
takes
no
account
of
the
theft
of
a
patronymic
worse
than
all
is
the
rape
of
ideas
which
these
caterers
for
the
public
mind
like
the
of
asia
tear
from
the
paternal
brain
before
they
are
well
matured
and
drag
before
the
eyes
of
their
blockhead
of
a
sultan
their
shahabaham
their
terrible
public
which
if
they
don
t
amuse
it
will
cut
off
their
heads
by
curtailing
the
ingots
and
emptying
their
pockets
this
madness
of
our
epoch
reacted
upon
the
illustrious
gaudissart
and
here
follows
the
history
of
how
it
happened
a
company
having
been
told
of
his
irresistible
eloquence
offered
him
an
commission
which
he
graciously
accepted
the
bargain
concluded
and
the
treaty
signed
our
traveller
was
put
in
training
or
we
might
say
weaned
by
the
of
the
enterprise
who
freed
his
mind
of
its
showed
him
the
dark
holes
of
the
business
taught
him
its
dialect
took
the
mechanism
apart
bit
by
bit
dissected
for
his
instruction
the
particular
public
he
was
expected
to
gull
crammed
him
with
phrases
fed
him
with
impromptu
replies
provisioned
him
with
unanswerable
arguments
and
so
to
speak
sharpened
the
file
of
the
tongue
which
was
about
to
operate
upon
the
life
of
france
the
puppet
amply
rewarded
the
pains
bestowed
upon
him
the
heads
of
the
company
boasted
of
the
illustrious
gaudissart
showed
him
such
attention
and
proclaimed
the
great
talents
of
this
perambulating
prospectus
so
loudly
in
the
sphere
of
exalted
banking
and
commercial
diplomacy
that
the
financial
managers
of
two
newspapers
celebrated
at
that
time
but
since
defunct
were
seized
with
the
idea
of
employing
him
to
get
subscribers
the
proprietors
of
the
globe
an
organ
of
and
the
movement
a
republican
journal
each
invited
the
illustrious
gaudissart
to
a
conference
and
proposed
to
give
him
ten
francs
a
head
for
every
subscriber
provided
he
brought
in
a
thousand
but
only
five
francs
if
he
got
no
more
than
five
hundred
the
cause
of
political
journalism
not
interfering
with
the
cause
of
life
insurance
the
bargain
was
struck
although
gaudissart
demanded
an
indemnity
from
the
for
the
eight
days
he
was
forced
to
spend
in
studying
the
doctrines
of
their
apostle
asserting
that
a
prodigious
effort
of
memory
and
intellect
was
necessary
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
that
article
and
to
reason
upon
it
suitably
he
asked
nothing
however
from
the
republicans
in
the
first
place
he
inclined
in
republican
ideas
the
only
ones
according
to
guadissardian
philosophy
which
could
bring
about
a
rational
equality
besides
which
he
had
already
dipped
into
the
conspiracies
of
the
french
carbonari
he
had
been
arrested
and
released
for
want
of
proof
and
finally
as
he
called
the
newspaper
proprietors
to
observe
he
had
lately
grown
a
mustache
and
needed
only
a
hat
of
certain
shape
and
a
pair
of
spurs
to
represent
with
due
propriety
the
republic
chapter
ii
for
one
whole
week
this
commanding
genius
went
every
morning
to
be
at
the
office
of
the
globe
and
every
afternoon
he
betook
himself
to
the
company
where
he
learned
the
intricacies
of
financial
diplomacy
his
aptitude
and
his
memory
were
prodigious
so
that
he
was
able
to
start
on
his
peregrinations
by
the
of
april
the
date
at
which
he
usually
opened
the
spring
campaign
two
large
commercial
houses
alarmed
at
the
decline
of
business
implored
the
ambitious
gaudissart
not
to
desert
the
article
paris
and
seduced
him
it
was
said
with
large
offers
to
take
their
commissions
once
more
the
king
of
travellers
was
amenable
to
the
claims
of
his
old
friends
enforced
as
they
were
by
the
enormous
premiums
offered
to
him
listen
my
little
jenny
he
said
in
a
to
a
pretty
florist
all
truly
great
men
delight
in
allowing
themselves
to
be
tyrannized
over
by
a
feeble
being
and
gaudissart
had
found
his
tyrant
in
jenny
he
was
bringing
her
home
at
eleven
o
clock
from
the
gymnase
whither
he
had
taken
her
in
full
dress
to
a
proscenium
box
on
the
first
tier
on
my
return
jenny
i
shall
refurnish
your
room
in
superior
style
that
big
matilda
who
pesters
you
with
comparisons
and
her
real
india
shawls
imported
by
the
suite
of
the
russian
ambassador
and
her
silver
plate
and
her
russian
prince
who
to
my
mind
is
nothing
but
a
humbug
won
t
have
a
word
to
say
i
consecrate
to
the
adornment
of
your
room
all
the
children
i
shall
get
in
the
well
that
s
a
pretty
thing
to
say
cried
the
florist
monster
of
a
man
do
you
dare
to
talk
to
me
of
your
children
do
you
suppose
i
am
going
to
stand
that
sort
of
thing
oh
what
a
goose
you
are
my
jenny
that
s
only
a
figure
of
speech
in
our
a
fine
business
then
well
but
listen
if
you
talk
all
the
time
you
ll
always
be
in
the
i
mean
to
be
upon
my
word
you
take
things
easy
you
don
t
let
me
finish
i
have
taken
under
my
protection
a
superlative
idea
a
journal
a
newspaper
written
for
children
in
our
profession
when
travellers
have
caught
let
us
suppose
ten
subscribers
to
the
children
s
journal
they
say
i
ve
got
ten
children
just
as
i
say
when
i
get
ten
subscriptions
to
a
newspaper
called
the
movement
i
ve
got
ten
now
don
t
you
see
that
s
all
right
are
you
going
into
politics
if
you
do
you
ll
get
into
and
i
shall
have
to
trot
down
there
after
you
oh
if
one
only
knew
what
one
puts
one
s
foot
into
when
we
love
a
man
on
my
word
of
honor
we
would
let
you
alone
to
take
care
of
yourselves
you
men
however
if
you
are
going
away
we
won
t
talk
of
disagreeable
things
that
would
be
the
coach
stopped
before
a
pretty
house
newly
built
in
the
rue
d
artois
where
gaudissart
and
jenny
climbed
to
the
fourth
story
this
was
the
abode
of
mademoiselle
jenny
courand
commonly
reported
to
be
privately
married
to
the
illustrious
gaudissart
a
rumor
which
that
individual
did
not
deny
to
maintain
her
supremacy
jenny
kept
him
to
the
performance
of
innumerable
small
attentions
and
threatened
continually
to
turn
him
off
if
he
omitted
the
least
of
them
she
now
ordered
him
to
write
to
her
from
every
town
and
render
a
minute
account
of
all
his
proceedings
how
many
children
will
it
take
to
furnish
my
chamber
she
asked
throwing
off
her
shawl
and
sitting
down
by
a
good
fire
i
get
five
sous
for
each
delightful
and
is
it
with
five
sous
that
you
expect
to
make
me
rich
perhaps
you
are
like
the
wandering
jew
with
your
pockets
full
of
but
jenny
i
shall
get
a
thousand
just
reflect
that
children
have
never
had
a
newspaper
to
themselves
before
but
what
a
fool
i
am
to
try
to
explain
matters
to
you
you
can
t
understand
such
can
t
i
then
tell
me
tell
me
gaudissart
if
i
m
such
a
goose
why
do
you
love
me
just
because
you
are
a
goose
a
sublime
goose
listen
jenny
see
here
i
am
going
to
undertake
the
globe
the
movement
the
children
the
insurance
business
and
some
of
my
old
articles
paris
instead
of
earning
a
miserable
eight
thousand
a
year
i
ll
bring
back
twenty
thousand
at
least
from
each
unlace
me
gaudissart
and
do
it
right
don
t
tighten
yes
truly
said
the
traveller
complacently
i
shall
become
a
shareholder
in
the
newspapers
like
finot
one
of
my
friends
the
son
of
a
hatter
who
now
has
thirty
thousand
francs
income
and
is
going
to
make
himself
a
peer
of
france
when
one
thinks
of
that
little
popinot
ah
mon
dieu
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
monsieur
popinot
was
named
minister
of
commerce
yesterday
why
shouldn
t
i
be
ambitious
too
ha
ha
i
could
easily
pick
up
the
jargon
of
those
fellows
who
talk
in
the
chamber
and
bluster
with
the
rest
of
them
now
listen
to
me
gentlemen
he
said
standing
behind
a
chair
the
press
is
neither
a
tool
nor
an
article
of
barter
it
is
viewed
under
its
political
aspects
an
institution
we
are
bound
in
virtue
of
our
position
as
legislators
to
consider
all
things
politically
and
therefore
here
he
stopped
to
get
breath
and
therefore
we
must
examine
the
press
and
ask
ourselves
if
it
is
useful
or
noxious
if
it
should
be
encouraged
or
put
down
taxed
or
free
these
are
serious
questions
i
feel
that
i
do
not
waste
the
time
always
precious
of
this
chamber
by
examining
this
article
the
press
and
explaining
to
you
its
qualities
we
are
on
the
verge
of
an
abyss
undoubtedly
the
laws
have
not
the
nap
which
they
ought
to
have
hein
he
said
looking
at
jenny
all
orators
put
france
on
the
verge
of
an
abyss
they
either
say
that
or
they
talk
about
the
chariot
of
state
or
convulsions
or
political
horizons
don
t
i
know
their
dodges
i
m
up
to
all
the
tricks
of
all
the
trades
do
you
know
why
because
i
was
born
with
a
caul
my
mother
has
got
it
but
i
ll
give
it
to
you
you
ll
see
i
shall
soon
be
in
the
you
why
shouldn
t
i
be
the
baron
gaudissart
peer
of
france
haven
t
they
twice
elected
monsieur
popinot
as
deputy
from
the
fourth
arrondissement
he
dines
with
louis
phillippe
there
s
finot
he
is
going
to
be
they
say
a
member
of
the
council
suppose
they
send
me
as
ambassador
to
london
i
tell
you
i
d
nonplus
those
english
no
man
ever
got
the
better
of
gaudissart
the
illustrious
gaudissart
and
nobody
ever
will
yes
i
say
it
no
one
ever
outwitted
me
and
no
one
can
in
any
walk
of
life
politics
or
impolitics
here
or
elsewhere
but
for
the
time
being
i
must
give
myself
wholly
to
the
capitalists
to
the
globe
the
movement
the
children
and
my
article
you
will
be
brought
up
with
a
round
turn
you
and
your
newspapers
i
ll
bet
you
won
t
get
further
than
poitiers
before
the
police
will
nab
what
will
you
bet
a
done
if
i
lose
that
shawl
i
ll
go
back
to
the
article
paris
and
the
hat
business
but
as
for
getting
the
better
of
gaudissart
never
never
and
the
illustrious
traveller
threw
himself
into
position
before
jenny
looked
at
her
proudly
one
hand
in
his
waistcoat
his
head
at
profile
an
attitude
truly
napoleonic
oh
how
funny
you
are
what
have
you
been
eating
gaudissart
was
years
of
age
of
medium
height
stout
and
fat
like
men
who
roll
about
continually
in
with
a
face
as
round
as
a
pumpkin
ruddy
cheeks
and
regular
features
of
the
type
which
sculptors
of
all
lands
adopt
as
a
model
for
statues
of
abundance
law
force
commerce
and
the
like
his
protuberant
stomach
swelled
forth
in
the
shape
of
a
pear
his
legs
were
small
but
active
and
vigorous
he
caught
jenny
up
in
his
arms
like
a
baby
and
kissed
her
hold
your
tongue
young
woman
he
said
what
do
you
know
about
antagonism
fourierism
criticism
heroic
enterprise
or
woman
s
freedom
i
ll
tell
you
what
they
are
ten
francs
for
each
subscription
madame
on
my
word
of
honor
you
are
going
crazy
more
and
more
crazy
about
he
replied
flinging
his
hat
upon
the
sofa
the
next
morning
gaudissart
having
breakfasted
gloriously
with
jenny
departed
on
horseback
to
work
up
the
chief
towns
of
the
district
to
which
he
was
assigned
by
the
various
enterprises
in
whose
interests
he
was
now
about
to
exercise
his
great
talents
after
spending
days
in
beating
up
the
country
between
paris
and
blois
he
remained
two
weeks
at
the
latter
place
to
write
up
his
correspondence
and
make
short
visits
to
the
various
market
towns
of
the
department
the
night
before
he
left
blois
for
tours
he
indited
a
letter
to
mademoiselle
jenny
courand
as
the
conciseness
and
charm
of
this
epistle
can
not
be
equalled
by
any
narration
of
ours
and
as
moreover
it
proves
the
legitimacy
of
the
tie
which
united
these
two
individuals
we
produce
it
here
my
dear
jenny
you
will
lose
your
wager
like
napoleon
gaudissart
the
illustrious
has
his
star
but
his
waterloo
i
triumph
everywhere
life
insurance
has
done
well
between
paris
and
blois
i
lodged
two
millions
but
as
i
get
to
the
centre
of
france
heads
become
infinitely
harder
and
millions
correspondingly
scarce
the
article
paris
keeps
up
its
own
little
it
is
a
ring
on
the
finger
with
all
my
cunning
i
spit
these
like
larks
i
got
off
one
hundred
and
ternaux
shawls
at
orleans
i
am
sure
i
don
t
know
what
they
will
do
with
them
unless
they
return
them
to
the
backs
of
the
sheep
as
to
the
article
journal
the
devil
that
s
a
horse
of
another
color
holy
saints
how
one
has
to
warble
before
you
can
teach
these
bumpkins
a
new
tune
i
have
only
made
movements
exactly
a
hundred
less
for
the
whole
trip
than
the
shawls
in
one
town
those
republican
rogues
they
won
t
subscribe
they
talk
they
talk
they
share
your
opinions
and
presently
you
are
all
agreed
that
every
existing
thing
must
be
overturned
you
feel
sure
your
man
is
going
to
subscribe
not
a
bit
of
it
if
he
owns
three
feet
of
ground
enough
to
grow
ten
cabbages
or
a
few
trees
to
slice
into
toothpicks
the
fellow
begins
to
talk
of
consolidated
property
taxes
revenues
indemnities
a
whole
lot
of
stuff
and
i
have
wasted
my
time
and
breath
on
patriotism
it
s
a
bad
business
candidly
the
movement
does
not
move
i
have
written
to
the
directors
and
told
them
so
i
am
sorry
for
it
on
account
of
my
political
opinions
as
for
the
globe
that
s
another
breed
altogether
just
set
to
work
and
talk
new
doctrines
to
people
you
fancy
are
fools
enough
to
believe
such
lies
why
they
think
you
want
to
burn
their
houses
down
it
is
vain
for
me
to
tell
them
that
i
speak
for
futurity
for
posterity
for
properly
understood
for
enterprise
where
nothing
can
be
lost
that
man
has
preyed
upon
man
long
enough
that
woman
is
a
slave
that
the
great
providential
thought
should
be
made
to
triumph
that
a
way
must
be
found
to
arrive
at
a
rational
of
the
social
fabric
in
short
the
whole
reverberation
of
my
sentences
well
what
do
you
think
when
i
open
upon
them
with
such
ideas
these
provincials
lock
their
cupboards
as
if
i
wanted
to
steal
their
spoons
and
beg
me
to
go
away
are
not
they
fools
geese
the
globe
is
smashed
i
said
to
the
proprietors
you
are
too
advanced
you
go
ahead
too
fast
you
ought
to
get
a
few
results
the
provinces
like
however
i
have
made
a
hundred
globes
and
i
must
say
considering
the
of
these
clodhoppers
it
is
a
miracle
but
to
do
it
i
had
to
make
them
such
a
lot
of
promises
that
i
am
sure
i
don
t
know
how
the
globites
globists
globules
or
whatever
they
call
themselves
will
ever
get
out
of
them
but
they
always
tell
me
they
can
make
the
world
a
great
deal
better
than
it
is
so
i
go
ahead
and
prophesy
to
the
value
of
ten
francs
for
each
subscription
there
was
one
farmer
who
thought
the
paper
was
agricultural
because
of
its
name
i
globed
bah
he
gave
in
at
once
he
had
a
projecting
forehead
all
men
with
projecting
foreheads
are
ideologists
but
the
children
oh
ah
as
to
the
children
i
got
two
thousand
between
paris
and
blois

i
have
had
a

here
at

about

my

i
was
unsuspiciously
eating
my

to
a

five
days
later
gaudissart
started
from
the
hotel
des
faisans
at
which
he
had
put
up
in
tours
and
went
to
vouvray
a
rich
and
populous
district
where
the
public
mind
seemed
to
him
susceptible
of
cultivation
mounted
upon
his
horse
he
trotted
along
the
embankment
thinking
no
more
of
his
phrases
than
an
actor
thinks
of
his
part
which
he
has
played
for
a
hundred
times
it
was
thus
that
the
illustrious
gaudissart
went
his
cheerful
way
admiring
the
landscape
and
little
dreaming
that
in
the
happy
valleys
of
vouvray
his
commercial
infallibility
was
about
to
perish
here
a
few
remarks
upon
the
public
mind
of
touraine
are
essential
to
our
story
the
subtle
satirical
epigrammatic
spirit
stamped
on
every
page
of
rabelais
is
the
faithful
expression
of
the
tourangian
mind
a
mind
polished
and
refined
as
it
should
be
in
a
land
where
the
kings
of
france
long
held
their
court
ardent
artistic
poetic
voluptuous
yet
whose
first
impulses
subside
quickly
the
softness
of
the
atmosphere
the
beauty
of
the
climate
a
certain
ease
of
life
and
joviality
of
manners
smother
before
long
the
sentiment
of
art
narrow
the
widest
heart
and
enervate
the
strongest
will
transplant
the
tourangian
and
his
fine
qualities
develop
and
lead
to
great
results
as
we
may
see
in
many
spheres
of
action
look
at
rabelais
and
semblancay
plantin
the
printer
and
descartes
boucicault
the
napoleon
of
his
day
and
pinaigrier
who
painted
most
of
the
colored
glass
in
our
cathedrals
also
verville
and
courier
but
the
tourangian
distinguished
though
he
may
be
in
other
regions
sits
in
his
own
home
like
an
indian
on
his
mat
or
a
turk
on
his
divan
he
employs
his
wit
in
laughing
at
his
neighbor
and
in
making
merry
all
his
days
and
when
at
last
he
reaches
the
end
of
his
life
he
is
still
a
happy
man
touraine
is
like
the
abbaye
of
theleme
so
vaunted
in
the
history
of
gargantua
there
we
may
find
the
complying
sisterhoods
of
that
famous
tale
and
there
the
good
cheer
celebrated
by
rabelais
reigns
in
glory
as
to
the
of
that
blessed
land
it
is
sublime
and
well
expressed
in
a
certain
popular
legend

of

land
of
france
is
it
to
the
peace
and
tranquillity
of
a
region
where
the
step
of
an
invader
has
never
trodden
that
we
owe
the
soft
compliance
of
these
unconstrained
and
easy
manners
to
such

to
bury
your

and
turn
your
projects
into
dreams
the
illustrious
gaudissart
was
fated
to
encounter
here
in
vouvray
one
of
those
indigenous
jesters
whose
jests
are
not
intolerable
solely
because
they
have
reached
the
perfection
of
the
mocking
art
right
or
wrong
the
tourangians
are
fond
of
inheriting
from
their
parents
consequently
the
doctrines
of
were
especially
hated
and
villified
among
them
in
touraine
hatred
and
villification
take
the
form
of
superb
disdain
and
witty
maliciousness
worthy
of
the
land
of
good
stories
and
practical
jokes
a
spirit
which
alas
is
yielding
day
by
day
to
that
other
spirit
which
lord
byron
has
characterized
as
english
for
his
sins
after
getting
down
at
the
soleil

inn
kept
by
a
former
grenadier
of

imperial
guard
named
mitouflet

to

the
illustrious
traveller
after
a
brief
consultation
with

betook
himself
to
the

and
at

with
all

which
they
deposited
with
the
fine
composure
of
ignorance
monsieur
vernier
such
was
the
name
of
this
great
little
man
was
just
finishing
his
breakfast
with
his
wife
and
daughter
on
either
side
of
him
when
gaudissart
entered
the
room
through
a
window
that
looked
out
on
the
loire
and
the
cher
and
lighted
one
of
the
gayest
of
that
gay
land
is
this
monsieur
vernier
himself
said
the
traveller
bending
his
vertebral
column
with
such
grace
that
it
seemed
to
be
elastic
yes
monsieur
said
the
mischievous
with
a
scrutinizing
look
which
took
in
the
style
of
man
he
had
to
deal
with
i
come
monsieur
resumed
gaudissart
to
solicit
the
aid
of
your
knowledge
and
insight
to
guide
my
efforts
in
this
district
where
mitouflet
tells
me
you
have
the
greatest
influence
monsieur
i
am
sent
into
the
provinces
on
an
enterprise
of
the
utmost
importance
undertaken
by
bankers
who
who
mean
to
win
our
tricks
said
vernier
long
used
to
the
ways
of
commercial
travellers
and
to
their
periodical
visits
precisely
replied
gaudissart
with
native
impudence
but
with
your
fine
tact
monsieur
you
must
be
aware
that
we
can
t
win
tricks
from
people
unless
it
is
their
interest
to
play
at
cards
i
beg
you
not
to
confound
me
with
the
vulgar
herd
of
travellers
who
succeed
by
humbug
or
importunity
i
am
no
longer
a
commercial
traveller
i
was
one
and
i
glory
in
it
but
my
mission
is
of
higher
importance
and
should
place
me
in
the
minds
of
superior
people
among
those
who
devote
themselves
to
the
enlightenment
of
their
country
the
most
distinguished
bankers
in
paris
take
part
in
this
affair
not
fictitiously
as
in
some
shameful
speculations
which
i
call
no
no
nothing
of
the
kind
i
should
never
condescend
never
to
hawk
about
such
no
monsieur
the
most
respectable
houses
in
paris
are
concerned
in
this
enterprise
and
their
interests
guarantee
hereupon
gaudissart
drew
forth
his
whole
string
of
phrases
and
monsieur
vernier
let
him
go
the
length
of
his
tether
listening
with
apparent
interest
which
completely
deceived
him
but
after
the
word
guarantee
vernier
paid
no
further
attention
to
our
traveller
s
rhetoric
and
turned
over
in
his
mind
how
to
play
him
some
malicious
trick
and
deliver
a
land
justly
considered
by
speculators
unable
to
get
a
bite
of
it
from
the
inroads
of
these
parisian
caterpillars
at
the
head
of
an
enchanting
valley
called
the
valley
coquette
because
of
its
windings
and
the
curves
which
return
upon
each
other
at
every
step
and
seem
more
and
more
lovely
as
we
advance
whether
we
ascend
or
descend
them
there
lived
in
a
little
house
surrounded
by
vineyards
a
man
named
margaritis
he
was
of
italian
origin
married
but
childless
and
his
wife
took
care
of
him
with
a
courage
fully
appreciated
by
the
neighborhood
madame
margaritis
was
undoubtedly
in
real
danger
from
a
man
who
among
other
fancies
persisted
in
carrying
about
with
him
two
knives
with
which
he
sometimes
threatened
her
who
has
not
seen
the
wonderful
shown
by
provincials
who
consecrate
their
lives
to
the
care
of
sufferers
possibly
because
of
the
disgrace
heaped
upon
a
bourgeoise
if
she
allows
her
husband
or
children
to
be
taken
to
a
public
hospital
moreover
who
does
not
know
the
repugnance
which
these
people
feel
to
the
payment
of
the
two
or
three
thousand
francs
required
at
charenton
or
in
the
private
lunatic
asylums
if
any
one
had
spoken
to
madame
margaritis
of
doctors
dubuisson
esquirol
blanche
and
others
she
would
have
preferred
with
noble
indignation
to
keep
her
thousands
and
take
care
of
the
at
home
as
the
incomprehensible
whims
of
this
lunatic
are
connected
with
the
current
of
our
story
we
are
compelled
to
exhibit
the
most
striking
of
them
margaritis
went
out
as
soon
as
it
rained
and
walked
about
in
his
vineyard
at
home
he
made
incessant
inquiries
for
newspapers
to
satisfy
him
his
wife
and
the
used
to
give
him
an
old
journal
called
the
and
for
seven
years
he
had
never
yet
perceived
that
he
was
reading
the
same
number
over
and
over
again
perhaps
a
doctor
would
have
observed
with
interest
the
connection
that
evidently
existed
between
the
recurring
and
spasmodic
demands
for
the
newspaper
and
the
atmospheric
variations
of
the
weather
usually
when
his
wife
had
company
which
happened
nearly
every
evening
for
the
neighbors
pitying
her
situation
would
frequently
come
to
play
at
boston
in
her
salon
margaritis
remained
silent
in
a
corner
and
never
stirred
but
the
moment
ten
o
clock
began
to
strike
on
a
clock
which
he
kept
shut
up
in
a
large
oblong
closet
he
rose
at
the
stroke
with
the
mechanical
precision
of
the
figures
which
are
made
to
move
by
springs
in
the
german
toys
he
would
then
advance
slowly
towards
the
players
give
them
a
glance
like
the
automatic
gaze
of
the
greeks
and
turks
exhibited
on
the
boulevard
du
temple
and
say
sternly
go
away
there
were
days
when
he
had
lucid
intervals
and
could
give
his
wife
excellent
advice
as
to
the
sale
of
their
wines
but
at
such
times
he
became
extremely
annoying
and
would
ransack
her
closets
and
steal
her
delicacies
which
he
devoured
in
secret
occasionally
when
the
usual
visitors
made
their
appearance
he
would
treat
them
with
civility
but
as
a
general
thing
his
remarks
and
replies
were
incoherent
for
instance
a
lady
once
asked
him
how
do
you
feel
monsieur
margaritis
i
have
grown
a
beard
he
replied
have
you
are
you
better
asked
another
jerusalem
jerusalem
was
the
answer
but
the
greater
part
of
the
time
he
gazed
stolidly
at
his
guests
without
uttering
a
word
and
then
his
wife
would
say
the
does
not
hear
anything
on
two
or
three
occasions
in
the
course
of
five
years
and
usually
about
the
time
of
the
equinox
this
remark
had
driven
him
to
frenzy
he
flourished
his
knives
and
shouted
that
joke
dishonors
me
as
for
his
daily
life
he
ate
drank
and
walked
about
like
other
men
in
sound
health
and
so
it
happened
that
he
was
treated
with
about
the
same
respect
and
attention
that
we
give
to
a
heavy
piece
of
furniture
among
his
many
absurdities
was
one
of
which
no
man
had
as
yet
discovered
the
object
although
by
long
practice
the
wiseheads
of
the
community
had
learned
to
unravel
the
meaning
of
most
of
his
vagaries
he
insisted
on
keeping
a
sack
of
flour
and
two
puncheons
of
wine
in
the
cellar
of
his
house
and
he
would
allow
no
one
to
lay
hands
on
them
but
then
the
month
of
june
came
round
he
grew
uneasy
with
the
restless
anxiety
of
a
madman
about
the
sale
of
the
sack
and
the
puncheons
madame
margaritis
could
nearly
always
persuade
him
that
the
wine
had
been
sold
at
an
enormous
price
which
she
paid
over
to
him
and
which
he
hid
so
cautiously
that
neither
his
wife
nor
the
servant
who
watched
him
had
ever
been
able
to
discover
its
the
evening
before
gaudissart
reached
vouvray
madame
margaritis
had
had
more
difficulty
than
usual
in
deceiving
her
husband
whose
mind
happened
to
be
uncommonly
lucid
i
really
don
t
know
how
i
shall
get
through
she
had
said
to
madame
vernier
would
you
believe
it
the
insists
on
watching
his
two
casks
of
wine
he
has
worried
me
so
this
whole
day
that
i
had
to
show
him
two
full
puncheons
our
neighbor
pierre
champlain
fortunately
had
two
which
he
had
not
sold
i
asked
him
to
kindly
let
me
have
them
rolled
into
our
cellar
and
oh
dear
now
that
the
has
seen
them
he
insists
on
bottling
them
off
himself
madame
vernier
had
related
the
poor
woman
s
trouble
to
her
husband
just
before
the
entrance
of
gaudissart
and
at
the
first
words
of
the
famous
traveller
vernier
determined
that
he
should
be
made
to
grapple
with
margaritis
monsieur
said
the
as
soon
as
the
illustrious
gaudissart
had
fired
his
first
broadside
i
will
not
hide
from
you
the
great
difficulties
which
my
native
place
offers
to
your
enterprise
this
part
of
the
country
goes
along
as
it
were
in
the
rough
suo
it
is
a
country
where
new
ideas
don
t
take
hold
we
live
as
our
fathers
lived
we
amuse
ourselves
with
four
meals
a
day
and
we
cultivate
our
vineyards
and
sell
our
wines
to
the
best
advantage
our
business
principle
is
to
sell
things
for
more
than
they
cost
us
we
shall
stick
in
that
rut
and
neither
god
nor
the
devil
can
get
us
out
of
it
i
will
however
give
you
some
advice
and
good
advice
is
an
egg
in
the
hand
there
is
in
this
town
a
retired
banker
in
whose
wisdom
i
have
i
particularly
the
greatest
confidence
if
you
can
obtain
his
support
i
will
add
mine
if
your
proposals
have
real
merit
if
we
are
convinced
of
the
advantage
of
your
enterprise
the
approval
of
monsieur
margaritis
which
carries
with
it
mine
will
open
to
you
at
least
twenty
rich
houses
in
vouvray
who
will
be
glad
to
try
your
when
madame
vernier
heard
the
name
of
the
lunatic
she
raised
her
head
and
looked
at
her
husband
ah
precisely
my
wife
intends
to
call
on
madame
margaritis
with
one
of
our
neighbors
wait
a
moment
and
you
can
accompany
these
ladies
you
can
pick
up
madame
fontanieu
on
your
way
said
the
wily
dyer
winking
at
his
wife
to
pick
out
the
greatest
gossip
the
sharpest
tongue
the
most
inveterate
cackler
of
the
neighborhood
it
meant
that
madame
vernier
was
to
take
a
witness
to
the
scene
between
the
traveller
and
the
lunatic
which
should
keep
the
town
in
laughter
for
a
month
monsieur
and
madame
vernier
played
their
part
so
well
that
gaudissart
had
no
suspicions
and
straightway
fell
into
the
trap
he
gallantly
offered
his
arm
to
madame
vernier
and
believed
that
he
made
as
they
went
along
the
conquest
of
both
ladies
for
those
benefit
he
sparkled
with
wit
and
humor
and
undetected
puns
the
house
of
the
pretended
banker
stood
at
the
entrance
to
the
valley
coquette
the
place
called
la
fuye
had
nothing
remarkable
about
it
on
the
ground
floor
was
a
large
wainscoted
salon
on
either
side
of
which
opened
the
bedroom
of
the
and
that
of
his
wife
the
salon
was
entered
from
an
which
served
as
the
and
communicated
with
the
kitchen
this
lower
door
which
was
wholly
without
the
external
charm
usually
seen
even
in
the
humblest
dwellings
in
touraine
was
covered
by
a
mansard
story
reached
by
a
stairway
built
on
the
outside
of
the
house
against
the
gable
end
and
protected
by
a
a
little
garden
full
of
marigolds
syringas
and
separated
the
house
from
the
fields
and
all
around
the
courtyard
were
detached
buildings
which
were
used
in
the
vintage
season
for
the
various
processes
of
making
wine
chapter
iv
margaritis
was
seated
in
an
covered
with
yellow
utrecht
velvet
near
the
window
of
the
salon
and
he
did
not
stir
as
the
two
ladies
entered
with
gaudissart
his
thoughts
were
running
on
the
casks
of
wine
he
was
a
spare
man
and
his
bald
head
garnished
with
a
few
spare
locks
at
the
back
of
it
was
in
conformation
his
sunken
eyes
overtopped
by
heavy
black
brows
and
surrounded
by
discolored
circles
his
nose
thin
and
sharp
like
the
blade
of
a
knife
the
strongly
marked
jawbone
the
hollow
cheeks
and
the
oblong
tendency
of
all
these
lines
together
with
his
unnaturally
long
and
flat
chin
contributed
to
give
a
peculiar
expression
to
his
countenance
something
between
that
of
a
retired
professor
of
rhetoric
and
a
monsieur
margaritis
cried
madame
vernier
addressing
him
come
stir
about
here
is
a
gentleman
whom
my
husband
sends
to
you
and
you
must
listen
to
him
with
great
attention
put
away
your
mathematics
and
talk
to
on
hearing
these
words
the
lunatic
rose
looked
at
gaudissart
made
him
a
sign
to
sit
down
and
said
let
us
converse
the
two
women
went
into
madame
margaritis
bedroom
leaving
the
door
open
so
as
to
hear
the
conversation
and
interpose
if
it
became
necessary
they
were
hardly
installed
before
monsieur
vernier
crept
softly
up
through
the
field
and
opening
a
window
got
into
the
bedroom
without
noise
monsieur
has
doubtless
been
in
business
began
gaudissart
public
business
answered
margaritis
interrupting
him
i
pacificated
calabria
under
the
reign
of
king
bless
me
if
he
hasn
t
gone
to
calabria
whispered
monsieur
vernier
in
that
case
said
gaudissart
we
shall
quickly
understand
each
i
am
listening
said
margaritis
striking
the
attitude
taken
by
a
man
when
he
poses
to
a
monsieur
said
gaudissart
who
chanced
to
be
turning
his
with
a
rotatory
and
periodical
click
which
caught
the
attention
of
the
lunatic
and
contributed
no
doubt
to
keep
him
quiet
monsieur
if
you
were
not
a
man
of
superior
intelligence
the
fool
bowed
i
should
content
myself
with
merely
laying
before
you
the
material
advantages
of
this
enterprise
whose
psychological
aspects
it
would
be
a
waste
of
time
to
explain
to
you
listen
of
all
kinds
of
social
wealth
is
not
time
the
most
precious
to
economize
time
is
consequently
to
become
wealthy
now
is
there
anything
that
consumes
so
much
time
as
those
anxieties
which
i
call
a
vulgar
expression
but
it
puts
the
whole
question
in
a
nutshell
for
instance
what
can
eat
up
more
time
than
the
inability
to
give
proper
security
to
persons
from
whom
you
seek
to
borrow
money
when
poor
at
the
moment
you
are
nevertheless
rich
in
hope
money
yes
that
s
right
said
margaritis
well
monsieur
i
am
sent
into
the
departments
by
a
company
of
bankers
and
capitalists
who
have
apprehended
the
enormous
waste
which
rising
men
of
talent
are
thus
making
of
time
and
consequently
of
intelligence
and
productive
ability
we
have
seized
the
idea
of
capitalizing
for
such
men
their
future
prospects
and
cashing
their
talents
by
discounting
what
securing
the
value
of
it
to
their
survivors
i
may
say
that
it
is
no
longer
a
question
of
economizing
time
but
of
giving
it
a
price
a
quotation
of
representing
in
a
pecuniary
sense
those
products
developed
by
time
which
presumably
you
possess
in
the
region
of
your
intellect
of
representing
also
the
moral
qualities
with
which
you
are
endowed
and
which
are
monsieur
living
forces
as
living
as
a
cataract
as
a
of
three
ten
twenty
fifty
ha
this
is
progress
the
movement
onward
to
a
better
state
of
things
a
movement
born
of
the
spirit
of
our
epoch
a
movement
essentially
progressive
as
i
shall
prove
to
you
when
we
come
to
consider
the
principles
involved
in
the
logical
of
the
social
fabric
i
will
now
explain
my
meaning
by
literal
examples
leaving
aside
all
purely
abstract
reasoning
which
i
call
the
mathematics
of
thought
instead
of
being
as
you
are
a
proprietor
living
upon
your
income
let
us
suppose
that
you
are
painter
a
musician
an
artist
or
a
poet
i
am
a
painter
said
the
lunatic
well
so
be
it
i
see
you
take
my
metaphor
you
are
a
painter
you
have
a
glorious
future
a
rich
future
before
you
but
i
go
still
farther
at
these
words
the
madman
looked
anxiously
at
gaudissart
thinking
he
meant
to
go
away
but
was
reassured
when
he
saw
that
he
kept
his
seat
you
may
even
be
nothing
at
all
said
gaudissart
going
on
with
his
phrases
but
you
are
conscious
of
yourself
you
feel
yourself
i
feel
myself
said
the
lunatic
you
feel
yourself
a
great
man
you
say
to
yourself
i
will
be
a
minister
of
well
then
you
painter
artist
man
of
letters
statesman
of
the
future
you
reckon
upon
your
talents
you
estimate
their
value
you
rate
them
let
us
say
at
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
do
you
give
me
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
yes
monsieur
as
you
will
see
either
your
heirs
and
assigns
will
receive
them
if
you
die
for
the
company
contemplates
that
event
or
you
will
receive
them
in
the
long
run
through
your
works
of
art
your
writings
or
your
fortunate
speculations
during
your
lifetime
but
as
i
have
already
had
the
honor
to
tell
you
when
you
have
once
fixed
upon
the
value
of
your
intellectual
capital
for
it
is
intellectual
capital
seize
that
idea
firmly
intellectual
i
understand
said
the
fool
you
sign
a
policy
of
insurance
with
a
company
which
recognizes
in
you
a
value
of
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
in
you
poet
i
am
a
painter
said
the
lunatic
yes
resumed
gaudissart
painter
poet
musician
statesman
and
binds
itself
to
pay
them
over
to
your
family
your
heirs
if
by
reason
of
your
death
the
hopes
foundered
on
your
intellectual
capital
should
be
overthrown
for
you
personally
the
payment
of
the
premium
is
all
that
is
required
to
protect
the
said
the
lunatic
sharply
interrupting
him
ah
naturally
yes
i
see
that
monsieur
understands
yes
said
the
madman
i
established
the
territorial
bank
in
the
rue
des
at
paris
in
for
resumed
gaudissart
going
back
to
his
premium
in
order
to
meet
the
payments
on
the
intellectual
capital
which
each
man
recognizes
and
esteems
in
himself
it
is
of
course
necessary
that
each
should
pay
a
certain
premium
three
per
cent
an
annual
due
of
three
per
cent
thus
by
the
payment
of
this
trifling
sum
a
mere
nothing
you
protect
your
family
from
disastrous
results
at
your
death
but
i
live
said
the
fool
ah
yes
you
mean
if
you
should
live
long
that
is
the
usual
objection
a
vulgar
prejudice
i
fully
agree
that
if
we
had
not
foreseen
and
demolished
it
we
might
feel
we
were
unworthy
of
being
what
what
are
we
after
all
in
the
great
bureau
of
intellect
monsieur
i
don
t
apply
these
remarks
to
you
but
i
meet
on
all
sides
men
who
make
it
a
business
to
teach
new
ideas
and
disclose
chains
of
reasoning
to
people
who
turn
pale
at
the
first
word
on
my
word
of
honor
it
is
pitiable
but
that
s
the
way
of
the
world
and
i
don
t
pretend
to
reform
it
your
objection
monsieur
is
really
sheer
why
asked
the
lunatic
why
this
is
why
because
if
you
live
and
possess
the
qualities
which
are
estimated
in
your
policy
against
the
chances
of
death
now
attend
to
this
i
am
well
then
you
have
succeeded
in
life
and
you
have
succeeded
because
of
the
said
insurance
you
doubled
your
chances
of
success
by
getting
rid
of
the
anxieties
you
were
dragging
about
with
you
in
the
shape
of
wife
and
children
who
might
otherwise
be
left
destitute
at
your
death
if
you
attain
this
certainty
you
have
touched
the
value
of
your
intellectual
capital
on
which
the
cost
of
insurance
is
but
a
trifle
a
mere
trifle
a
that
s
a
fine
idea
ah
is
it
not
monsieur
cried
gaudissart
i
call
this
enterprise
the
exchequer
of
beneficence
a
mutual
insurance
against
poverty
or
if
you
like
it
better
the
discounting
the
cashing
of
talent
for
talent
monsieur
is
a
bill
of
exchange
which
nature
gives
to
the
man
of
genius
and
which
often
has
a
long
time
to
run
before
it
falls
that
is
usury
cried
margaritis
the
devil
he
s
keen
the
old
fellow
i
ve
made
a
mistake
thought
gaudissart
i
must
catch
him
with
other
chaff
i
ll
try
humbug
no
not
at
all
he
said
aloud
for
you
who
will
you
take
a
glass
of
wine
asked
margaritis
with
pleasure
replied
gaudissart
wife
give
us
a
bottle
of
the
wine
that
is
in
the
puncheons
you
are
here
at
the
very
head
of
vouvray
he
continued
with
a
gesture
of
the
hand
the
vineyard
of
the
brought
glasses
and
a
bottle
of
wine
of
the
vintage
of
the
filled
a
glass
with
circumspection
and
offered
it
to
gaudissart
who
drank
it
up
ah
you
are
joking
monsieur
exclaimed
the
commercial
traveller
surely
this
is
madeira
true
madeira
so
you
think
said
the
fool
the
trouble
with
our
vouvray
wine
is
that
it
is
neither
a
common
wine
nor
a
wine
that
can
be
drunk
with
the
entremets
it
is
too
generous
too
strong
it
is
often
sold
in
paris
adulterated
with
brandy
and
called
madeira
the
buy
it
up
when
our
vintage
has
not
been
good
enough
for
the
dutch
and
belgian
markets
to
mix
it
with
wines
grown
in
the
neighborhood
of
paris
and
call
it
bordeaux
but
what
you
are
drinking
just
now
my
good
monsieur
is
a
wine
for
kings
the
pure
head
of
vouvray
that
s
it
s
name
i
have
two
puncheons
only
two
puncheons
of
it
left
people
who
like
fine
wines
wines
who
furnish
their
table
with
qualities
that
can
t
be
bought
in
the
regular
trade
and
there
are
many
persons
in
paris
who
have
that
vanity
well
such
people
send
direct
to
us
for
this
wine
do
you
know
any
one
who
let
us
go
on
with
what
we
were
saying
interposed
gaudissart
we
are
going
on
said
the
fool
my
wine
is
capital
you
are
capital
capitalist
intellectual
capital
capital
wine
all
the
same
etymology
don
t
you
see
hein
capital
caput
head
head
of
vouvray
that
s
my
wine
it
s
all
one
so
that
you
have
realized
your
intellectual
capital
through
your
wines
ah
i
see
said
gaudissart
i
have
realized
said
the
lunatic
would
you
like
to
buy
my
puncheons
you
shall
have
them
on
good
no
i
was
merely
speaking
said
the
illustrious
gaudissart
of
the
results
of
insurance
and
the
employment
of
intellectual
capital
i
will
resume
my
the
lunatic
calmed
down
and
fell
once
more
into
position
i
remarked
monsieur
that
if
you
die
the
capital
will
be
paid
to
your
family
without
without
discussion
yes
unless
there
were
that
s
no
monsieur
you
are
aware
that
suicide
is
one
of
those
acts
which
are
easy
to
prove
in
france
said
the
fool
but
but
in
other
countries
said
gaudissart
well
monsieur
to
cut
short
discussion
on
this
point
i
will
say
once
for
all
that
death
in
foreign
countries
or
on
the
field
of
battle
is
outside
of
our
then
what
are
you
insuring
nothing
at
all
cried
margaritis
my
bank
my
territorial
bank
rested
upon
nothing
at
all
exclaimed
gaudissart
interrupting
the
nothing
at
all
what
do
you
call
sickness
and
afflictions
and
poverty
and
passions
don
t
go
off
on
exceptional
no
no
no
points
said
the
lunatic
now
what
s
the
result
of
all
this
cried
gaudissart
to
you
a
banker
i
can
sum
up
the
profits
in
a
few
words
listen
a
man
lives
he
has
a
future
he
appears
well
he
lives
let
us
say
by
his
art
he
wants
money
he
tries
to
get
it
he
fails
civilization
withholds
cash
from
this
man
whose
thought
could
master
civilization
and
ought
to
master
it
and
will
master
it
some
day
with
a
brush
a
chisel
with
words
ideas
theories
systems
civilization
is
atrocious
it
denies
bread
to
the
men
who
give
it
luxury
it
starves
them
on
sneers
and
curses
the
beggarly
rascal
my
words
may
be
strong
but
i
shall
not
retract
them
well
this
great
but
neglected
man
comes
to
us
we
recognize
his
greatness
we
salute
him
with
respect
we
listen
to
him
he
says
to
us
gentlemen
my
life
and
talents
are
worth
so
much
on
my
productions
i
will
pay
you
such
or
such
very
good
what
do
we
do
instantly
without
reserve
or
hesitation
we
admit
him
to
the
great
festivals
of
civilization
as
an
honored
guest
you
need
wine
for
that
interposed
the
madman
as
an
honored
guest
he
signs
the
insurance
policy
he
takes
our
bits
of
paper
scraps
rags
miserable
rags
which
nevertheless
have
more
power
in
the
world
than
his
unaided
genius
then
if
he
wants
money
every
one
will
lend
it
to
him
on
those
rags
at
the
bourse
among
bankers
wherever
he
goes
even
at
the
usurers
he
will
find
money
because
he
can
give
security
well
monsieur
is
not
that
a
great
gulf
to
bridge
over
in
our
social
system
but
that
is
only
one
aspect
of
our
work
we
insure
debtors
by
another
scheme
of
policies
and
premiums
we
offer
annuities
at
rates
graduated
according
to
ages
on
a
infinitely
more
advantageous
than
what
are
called
tontines
which
are
based
on
tables
of
mortality
that
are
notoriously
false
our
company
deals
with
large
masses
of
men
consequently
the
annuitants
are
secure
from
those
distressing
fears
which
sadden
old
age
too
sad
already
fears
which
pursue
those
who
receive
annuities
from
private
sources
you
see
monsieur
that
we
have
estimated
life
under
all
its
sucked
it
at
both
ends
said
the
lunatic
take
another
glass
of
wine
you
ve
earned
it
you
must
line
your
inside
with
velvet
if
you
are
going
to
pump
at
it
like
that
every
day
monsieur
the
wine
of
vouvray
if
well
kept
is
downright
now
what
do
you
think
of
it
all
said
gaudissart
emptying
his
glass
it
is
very
fine
very
new
very
useful
but
i
like
the
discounts
i
get
at
my
territorial
bank
rue
des
you
are
quite
right
monsieur
answered
gaudissart
but
that
sort
of
thing
is
taken
and
retaken
made
and
remade
every
day
you
have
also
hypothecating
banks
which
lend
upon
landed
property
and
redeem
it
on
a
large
scale
but
that
is
a
narrow
idea
compared
to
our
system
of
consolidating
hopes
consolidating
hopes
coagulating
so
to
speak
the
aspirations
born
in
every
soul
and
insuring
the
realization
of
our
dreams
it
needed
our
epoch
monsieur
the
epoch
of
transition
transition
and
progress
yes
progress
muttered
the
lunatic
with
his
glass
at
his
lips
i
like
progress
that
is
what
i
ve
told
them
many
times
the
times
cried
gaudissart
who
did
not
catch
the
whole
sentence
the
times
is
a
bad
newspaper
if
you
read
that
i
am
sorry
for
the
newspaper
cried
margaritis
of
course
wife
wife
where
is
the
newspaper
he
cried
going
towards
the
next
room
if
you
are
interested
in
newspapers
said
gaudissart
changing
his
attack
we
are
sure
to
understand
each
yes
but
before
we
say
anything
about
that
tell
me
what
you
think
of
this
delicious
then
let
us
finish
the
the
lunatic
poured
out
a
thimbleful
for
himself
and
filled
gaudissart
s
glass
well
monsieur
i
have
two
puncheons
left
of
the
same
wine
if
you
find
it
good
we
can
come
to
exactly
said
gaudissart
the
fathers
of
the
faith
have
authorized
me
to
send
them
all
the
commodities
i
but
allow
me
to
tell
you
about
their
noble
newspaper
you
who
have
understood
the
whole
question
of
insurance
so
thoroughly
and
who
are
willing
to
assist
my
work
in
this
district
yes
said
margaritis
if
if
i
take
your
wine
i
understand
perfectly
your
wine
is
very
good
monsieur
it
puts
the
stomach
in
a
they
make
champagne
out
of
it
there
is
a
man
from
paris
who
comes
here
and
makes
it
in
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
monsieur
the
globe
of
which
we
were
speaking
yes
i
ve
gone
over
it
said
margaritis
i
was
sure
of
it
exclaimed
gaudissart
monsieur
you
have
a
fine
frontal
development
a
pate
excuse
the
word
which
our
gentlemen
call
there
s
a
horse
element
in
the
head
of
every
great
man
genius
will
make
itself
known
but
sometimes
it
happens
that
great
men
in
spite
of
their
gifts
remain
obscure
such
was
very
nearly
the
case
with
also
with
monsieur
vico
a
strong
man
just
beginning
to
shoot
up
i
am
proud
of
vico
now
here
we
enter
upon
the
new
theory
and
formula
of
humanity
attention
if
you
attention
said
the
fool
falling
into
position
man
s
spoliation
of
man
by
which
i
mean
bodies
of
men
living
upon
the
labor
of
other
men
ought
to
have
ceased
with
the
coming
of
christ
i
say
who
was
sent
to
proclaim
the
equality
of
man
in
the
sight
of
god
but
what
is
the
fact
equality
up
to
our
day
has
been
an
ignus
fatuus
a
chimera
has
arisen
as
the
complement
of
christ
as
the
modern
exponent
of
the
doctrine
of
equality
or
rather
of
its
practice
for
theory
has
served
its
time
is
he
liberated
asked
the
lunatic
like
liberalism
it
has
had
its
day
there
is
a
nobler
future
before
us
a
new
faith
free
labor
free
growth
free
production
individual
progress
a
social
in
which
each
man
shall
receive
the
full
worth
of
his
individual
labor
in
which
no
man
shall
be
preyed
upon
by
other
men
who
without
capacity
of
their
own
compel
to
work
for
the
profit
of
from
this
comes
the
doctrine
of
how
about
servants
demanded
the
lunatic
they
will
remain
servants
if
they
have
no
capacity
beyond
then
what
s
the
good
of
your
doctrine
to
judge
of
this
doctrine
monsieur
you
must
consider
it
from
a
higher
point
of
view
you
must
take
a
general
survey
of
humanity
here
we
come
to
the
theories
of
ballance
do
you
know
his
palingenesis
i
am
fond
of
them
said
the
fool
who
thought
he
said
good
returned
gaudissart
well
then
if
the
palingenistic
aspects
of
the
successive
transformations
of
the
spiritualized
globe
have
struck
stirred
roused
you
then
my
dear
sir
the
globe
newspaper
noble
name
which
proclaims
its
mission
the
globe
is
an
organ
a
guide
who
will
explain
to
you
with
the
coming
of
each
day
the
conditions
under
which
this
vast
political
and
moral
change
will
be
effected
the
gentlemen
who
do
they
drink
wine
yes
monsieur
their
houses
are
kept
up
in
the
highest
style
i
may
say
in
prophetic
style
superb
salons
large
receptions
the
apex
of
social
life
well
remarked
the
lunatic
the
workmen
who
pull
things
down
want
wine
as
much
as
those
who
put
things
true
said
the
illustrious
gaudissart
and
all
the
more
monsieur
when
they
pull
down
with
one
hand
and
build
up
with
the
other
like
the
apostles
of
the
they
want
good
wine
head
of
vouvray
two
puncheons
three
hundred
bottles
only
one
hundred
francs
a
how
much
is
that
a
bottle
said
gaudissart
calculating
let
me
see
there
s
the
freight
and
the
duty
it
will
come
to
about
seven
sous
why
it
wouldn
t
be
a
bad
thing
they
give
more
for
worse
wines
good
i
ve
got
him
thought
gaudissart
he
wants
to
sell
me
wine
which
i
want
i
ll
master
him
well
monsieur
he
continued
those
who
argue
usually
come
to
an
agreement
let
us
be
frank
with
each
other
you
have
great
influence
in
this
district
i
should
think
so
said
the
madman
i
am
the
head
of
vouvray
well
i
see
that
you
thoroughly
comprehend
the
insurance
of
intellectual
capital
and
that
you
have
measured
the
full
importance
of
the
globe
twice
on
gaudissart
was
listening
to
himself
and
not
to
the
replies
of
his
hearer
therefore
in
view
of
your
circumstances
and
of
your
age
i
quite
understand
that
you
have
no
need
of
insurance
for
yourself
but
monsieur
you
might
induce
others
to
insure
either
because
of
their
inherent
qualities
which
need
development
or
for
the
protection
of
their
families
against
a
precarious
future
now
if
you
will
subscribe
to
the
globe
and
give
me
your
personal
assistance
in
this
district
on
behalf
of
insurance
especially
for
the
provinces
are
much
attached
to
annuities
well
if
you
will
do
this
then
we
can
come
to
an
understanding
about
the
wine
will
you
take
the
globe
i
stand
on
the
will
you
advance
its
interests
in
this
district
i
and
and
and
i
but
you
do
subscribe
don
t

the
globe
the

the
lunatic

your
leisure
it

the
very
thing
to
make
time
pass
agreeably

the
that

me
said
the
lunatic
it
only
costs
a
trifle
eighty
that
won
t
suit
me
said
the
lunatic
monsieur
cried
gaudissart
of
course
you
have
got
grandchildren

the
children

journal
that
only

seven
francs
a
very
good

man
living

hein
you

monsieur
said
gaudissart
i
ve
hit

to
push

in
the
district
in
the
i

approbation

yes
i
m
that
said
the
fool
come
out
and
see
my
willingly
the
wine
is
getting
into
my
head
said
the
illustrious
gaudissart
following
monsieur
margaritis
who
marched
him
from
row
to
row
and
hillock
to
hillock
among
the
vines
the
three
ladies
and
monsieur
vernier
left
to
themselves
went
off
into
fits
of
laughter
as
they
watched
the
traveller
and
the
lunatic
discussing
gesticulating
stopping
short
resuming
their
walk
and
talking
vehemently
i
wish
the
hadn
t
carried
him
off
said
vernier
finally
the
pair
returned
walking
with
the
eager
step
of
men
who
were
in
haste
to
finish
up
a
matter
of
business
he
has
got
the
better
of
the
parisian
damn
him
cried
vernier
and
so
it
was
to
the
huge
delight
of
the
lunatic
our
illustrious
gaudissart
sat
down
at
a
and
wrote
an
order
for
the
delivery
of
the
two
casks
of
wine
margaritis
having
carefully
read
it
over
counted
out
seven
francs
for
his
subscription
to
the
children
s
journal
and
gave
them
to
the
traveller
adieu
until
monsieur
said
gaudissart
twisting
his
i
shall
have
the
honor
to
call
for
you
meantime
send
the
wine
at
once
to
paris
to
the
address
i
have
given
you
and
the
price
will
be
remitted
gaudissart
however
was
a
norman
and
he
had
no
idea
of
making
any
agreement
which
was
not
reciprocal
he
therefore
required
his
promised
supporter
to
sign
a
bond
which
the
lunatic
carefully
read
over
to
deliver
two
puncheons
of
the
wine
called
head
of
vouvray
vineyard
of
margaritis
this
done
the
illustrious
gaudissart
departed
in
high
feather
humming
as
he
skipped
along
the
king
of
the
south
he
burned
his
mouth
etc
chapter
v
the
illustrious
gaudissart
returned
to
the
soleil
d
or
where
he
naturally
conversed
with
the
landlord
while
waiting
for
dinner
mitouflet
was
an
old
soldier
guilelessly
crafty
like
the
peasantry
of
the
loire
he
never
laughed
at
a
jest
but
took
it
with
the
gravity
of
a
man
accustomed
to
the
roar
of
cannon
and
to
make
his
own
jokes
under
arms
you
have
some
very
people
here
said
gaudissart
leaning
against
the
and
lighting
his
cigar
at
mitouflet
s
pipe
how
do
you
mean
asked
mitouflet
i
mean
people
who
are
on
political
and
financial
whom
have
you
seen
if
i
may
ask
without
indiscretion
said
the
landlord
innocently
expectorating
after
the
adroit
and
periodical
fashion
of
smokers
a
fine
energetic
fellow
named
mitouflet
cast
two
glances
in
succession
at
his
guest
which
were
expressive
of
chilling
irony
may
be
the
knows
a
deal
he
knows
too
much
for
other
folks
who
can
t
always
understand
i
can
believe
it
for
he
thoroughly
comprehends
the
abstruse
principles
of
yes
said
the
innkeeper
and
for
my
part
i
am
sorry
he
is
a
a
lunatic
what
do
you
mean
well
crazy
cracked
as
people
are
when
they
are
insane
answered
mitouflet
but
he
is
not
dangerous
his
wife
takes
care
of
him
have
you
been
arguing
with
him
added
the
pitiless
landlord
that
must
have
been
funny
funny
cried
gaudissart
funny
then
your
monsieur
vernier
has
been
making
fun
of
me
did
he
send
you
there
wife
wife
come
here
and
listen
if
monsieur
vernier
didn
t
take
it
into
his
head
to
send
this
gentleman
to
talk
to
margaritis
what
in
the
world
did
you
say
to
each
other
my
dear
good
monsieur
said
the
wife
why
he
s
crazy
he
sold
me
two
casks
of
did
you
buy
them
but
that
is
his
delusion
he
thinks
he
sells
his
wine
and
he
hasn
t
ha
snorted
the
traveller
then
i
ll
go
straight
to
monsieur
vernier
and
thank
and
gaudissart
departed
boiling
over
with
rage
to
shake
the
whom
he
found
in
his
salon
laughing
with
a
company
of
friends
to
whom
he
had
already
recounted
the
tale
monsieur
said
the
prince
of
travellers
darting
a
savage
glance
at
his
enemy
you
are
a
scoundrel
and
a
blackguard
and
under
pain
of
being
thought
a
a
species
of
being
far
below
a
you
will
give
me
satisfaction
for
the
insult
you
dared
to
offer
me
in
sending
me
to
a
man
whom
you
knew
to
be
a
lunatic
do
you
hear
me
monsieur
vernier
dyer
such
was
the
harangue
which
gaudissart
prepared
as
he
went
along
as
a
tragedian
makes
ready
for
his
entrance
on
the
scene
what
cried
vernier
delighted
at
the
presence
of
an
audience
do
you
think
we
have
no
right
to
make
fun
of
a
man
who
comes
here
bag
and
baggage
and
demands
that
we
hand
over
our
property
because
forsooth
he
is
pleased
to
call
us
great
men
painters
artists
poets
mixing
us
up
gratuitously
with
a
set
of
fools
who
have
neither
house
nor
home
nor
sous
nor
sense
why
should
we
put
up
with
a
rascal
who
comes
here
and
wants
us
to
feather
his
nest
by
subscribing
to
a
newspaper
which
preaches
a
new
religion
whose
first
doctrine
is
if
you
please
that
we
are
not
to
inherit
from
our
fathers
and
mothers
on
my
sacred
word
of
honor
pere
margaritis
said
things
a
great
deal
more
sensible
and
now
what
are
you
complaining
about
you
and
margaritis
seemed
to
understand
each
other
the
gentlemen
here
present
can
testify
that
if
you
had
talked
to
the
whole
canton
you
couldn
t
have
been
as
well
that
s
all
very
well
for
you
to
say
but
i
have
been
insulted
monsieur
and
i
demand
satisfaction
very
good
monsieur
consider
yourself
insulted
if
you
like
i
shall
not
give
you
satisfaction
because
there
is
neither
rhyme
nor
reason
nor
satisfaction
to
be
found
in
the
whole
business
what
an
absurd
fool
he
is
to
be
sure
at
these
words
gaudissart
flew
at
the
dyer
to
give
him
a
slap
on
the
face
but
the
listening
crowd
rushed
between
them
so
that
the
illustrious
traveller
only
contrived
to
knock
off
the
wig
of
his
enemy
which
fell
on
the
head
of
mademoiselle
clara
vernier
if
you
are
not
satisfied
monsieur
he
said
i
shall
be
at
the
soleil
d
or
until
morning
and
you
will
find
me
ready
to
show
you
what
it
means
to
give
satisfaction
i
fought
in
july
and
you
shall
fight
in
vouvray
answered
the
dyer
and
what
is
more
you
shall
stay
here
longer
than
you
gaudissart
marched
off
turning
over
in
his
mind
this
prophetic
remark
which
seemed
to
him
full
of
sinister
portent
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
the
prince
of
travellers
did
not
dine
jovially
the
whole
town
of
vouvray
was
put
in
a
ferment
about
the
affair
between
monsieur
vernier
and
the
apostle
of
never
before
had
the
tragic
event
of
a
duel
been
so
much
as
heard
of
in
that
benign
and
happy
valley
monsieur
mitouflet
i
am
to
fight
with
monsieur
vernier
said
gaudissart
to
his
landlord
i
know
no
one
here
will
you
be
my
second
willingly
said
the
host
gaudissart
had
scarcely
finished
his
dinner
before
madame
fontanieu
and
the
of
vouvray
came
to
the
soleil
d
or
and
took
mitouflet
aside
they
told
him
it
would
be
a
painful
and
injurious
thing
to
the
whole
canton
if
a
violent
death
were
the
result
of
this
affair
they
represented
the
pitiable
distress
of
madame
vernier
and
conjured
him
to
find
some
way
to
arrange
matters
and
save
the
credit
of
the
district
i
take
it
all
upon
myself
said
the
sagacious
landlord
in
the
evening
he
went
up
to
the
traveller
s
room
carrying
pens
ink
and
paper
what
have
you
got
there
asked
gaudissart
if
you
are
going
to
fight
answered
mitouflet
you
had
better
make
some
settlement
of
your
affairs
and
perhaps
you
have
letters
to
write
we
all
have
beings
who
are
dear
to
us
writing
doesn
t
kill
you
know
are
you
a
good
swordsman
would
you
like
to
get
your
hand
in
i
have
some
yes
mitouflet
returned
with
foils
and
masks
now
then
let
us
see
what
you
can
the
pair
put
themselves
on
guard
mitouflet
with
his
former
prowess
as
grenadier
of
the
guard
made
passes
at
gaudissart
pushed
him
about
right
and
left
and
finally
pinned
him
up
against
the
wall
the
deuce
you
are
strong
said
gaudissart
out
of
breath
monsieur
vernier
is
stronger
than
i
the
devil
damn
it
i
shall
fight
with
i
advise
you
to
do
so
because
if
you
take
large
holster
pistols
and
load
them
up
to
their
muzzles
you
can
t
risk
anything
they
are
to
fire
wide
of
the
mark
and
both
parties
can
retire
from
the
field
with
honor
let
me
manage
all
that
hein
sapristi
two
brave
men
would
be
arrant
fools
to
kill
each
other
for
a
are
you
sure
the
pistols
will
carry
i
should
be
sorry
to
kill
the
man
after
all
said
gaudissart
sleep
in
peace
answered
mitouflet
departing
the
next
morning
the
two
adversaries
more
or
less
pale
met
beside
the
bridge
of
la
cise
the
brave
vernier
came
near
shooting
a
cow
which
was
peaceably
feeding
by
the
roadside
ah
you
fired
in
the
air
cried
gaudissart
at
these
words
the
enemies
embraced
monsieur
said
the
traveller
your
joke
was
rather
rough
but
it
was
a
good
one
for
all
that
i
am
sorry
i
apostrophized
you
i
was
excited
i
regard
you
as
a
man
of
monsieur
we
take
twenty
subscriptions
to
the
children
s
journal
replied
the
dyer
still
pale
that
being
so
said
gaudissart
why
shouldn
t
we
all
breakfast
together
men
who
fight
are
always
the
ones
to
come
to
a
good
monsieur
mitouflet
said
gaudissart
on
his
return
to
the
inn
of
course
you
have
got
a
sheriff
s
officer
here
what
for
i
want
to
send
a
summons
to
my
good
friend
margaritis
to
deliver
the
two
casks
of
but
he
has
not
got
them
said
vernier
no
matter
for
that
the
affair
can
be
arranged
by
the
payment
of
an
indemnity
i
won
t
have
it
said
that
vouvray
outwitted
the
illustrious
madame
margaritis
alarmed
at
the
prospect
of
a
suit
in
which
the
plaintiff
would
certainly
win
his
case
brought
thirty
francs
to
the
placable
traveller
who
thereupon
considered
himself
quits
with
the
happiest
region
of
sunny
france
a
region
which
is
also
we
must
add
the
most
recalcitrant
to
new
and
progressive
ideas
on
returning
from
his
trip
through
the
southern
departments
the
illustrious
gaudissart
occupied
the
coupe
of
a
diligence
where
he
met
a
young
man
to
whom
as
they
journeyed
between
angouleme
and
paris
he
deigned
to
explain
the
enigmas
of
life
taking
him
apparently
for
an
infant
as
they
passed
vouvray
the
young
man
exclaimed
what
a
fine
site
yes
monsieur
said
gaudissart
but
not
habitable
on
account
of
the
people
you
get
into
duels
every
day
why
it
is
not
three
months
since
i
fought
one
just
there
pointing
to
the
bridge
of
la
cise
with
a
damned
dyer
but
i
made
an
end
of
him
he
bit
the
dust
