introduction
introducing
a
reader
to
christy
mathewson
seems
like
a
superfluous
piece
of
writing
and
a
waste
of
white
paper
schoolboys
of
the
last
ten
years
have
been
acquainted
with
the
exact
figures
which
have
made
up
pitching
record
before
they
had
ever
heard
of
george
washington
because
george
did
play
in
the
same
league
perfectly
good
rational
and
normal
citizens
once
deserted
a
reception
to
the
governor
of
the
state
because
christy
mathewson
was
going
to
pitch
against
the
chicago
club
if
the
committee
on
arrangements
wanted
to
make
the
hour
of
the
reception
earlier
all
right
but
no
one
could
be
expected
to
miss
seeing
matty
in
the
box
against
chance
and
his
cubs
for
the
sake
of
greeting
the
governor
besides
being
a
national
hero
matty
is
one
of
the
closest
students
of
baseball
that
ever
came
into
the
big
league
by
players
he
has
long
been
recognized
as
the
greatest
pitcher
the
game
has
produced
he
has
been
pitching
in
the
big
leagues
for
eleven
years
and
winning
games
right
along
his
great
pitching
practically
won
the
world
championship
for
the
giants
from
the
philadelphia
athletics
in
and
six
years
later
he
was
responsible
for
one
of
the
two
victories
turned
in
by
new
york
pitchers
in
a
world
series
again
with
the
athletics
at
certain
periods
in
his
baseball
career
he
has
pitched
almost
every
day
after
the
rest
of
the
staff
had
fallen
down
when
the
giants
were
making
their
determined
fight
for
the
championship
in
the
season
that
the
race
was
finally
decided
by
a
single
game
with
the
cubs
he
worked
in
nine
out
of
the
last
fifteen
games
in
an
effort
to
save
his
club
from
defeat
and
he
won
most
of
them
that
has
always
been
the
beauty
of
his
pitching
his
ability
to
win
matty
was
born
in
factoryville
years
ago
and
after
going
to
bucknell
college
he
began
to
play
ball
with
the
norfolk
club
of
the
virginia
league
but
was
soon
bought
by
the
new
york
giants
where
he
has
remained
ever
since
and
is
likely
to
stay
for
some
time
to
come
if
he
can
continue
to
make
himself
as
welcome
as
he
has
been
so
far
he
was
only
nineteen
when
he
joined
the
club
and
was
a
headliner
from
the
start
always
he
has
been
a
student
and
something
of
a
writer
having
done
newspaper
work
from
time
to
time
during
the
big
series
he
has
made
a
careful
study
of
the
big
league
batters
he
has
kept
a
sort
of
baseball
diary
of
his
career
and
frequently
i
have
heard
him
relate
unwritten
chapters
of
baseball
history
filled
with
the
thrilling
incidents
of
his
personal
experience
why
do
you
write
a
real
book
of
the
big
leaguers
i
asked
him
one
day
and
he
has
done
it
in
this
book
he
is
telling
the
reader
of
the
game
as
it
is
played
in
the
big
leagues
as
a
college
man
he
is
able
to
put
his
impressions
of
the
big
leagues
on
paper
graphically
it
as
good
as
his
pitching
and
some
exciting
things
have
happened
in
the
big
leagues
stories
that
never
found
their
way
into
the
newspapers
matty
has
told

this

information
on
all
the
great
i
have
often
been
asked
to
which
batters
i
have
found
it
hardest
to
pitch
it
is
the
general
impression
among
baseball
fans
that
joseph
faversham
tinker
the
of
the
chicago
cubs
is
the
worst
man
that
i
have
to
face
in
the
national
league
few
realize
that
during
his
first
two
years
in
the
big
show
joe
tinker
looked
like
a
cripple
at
the
plate
when
i
was
pitching
his
groove
was
a
slow
curve
over
the
outside
corner
and
i
fed
him
slow
curves
over
that
very
outside
corner
with
great
regularity
then
suddenly
overnight
he
became
from
my
point
of
view
the
most
dangerous
batter
in
the
league
tinker
is
a
clever
and
one
day
i
struck
him
out
three
times
in
succession
with
low
curves
over
the
outside
corner
instead
of
getting
disgusted
with
himself
he
began
to
think
and
reason
he
knew
that
i
was
feeding
him
that
low
curve
over
the
outside
corner
and
he
started
to
look
for
an
antidote
he
had
always
taken
a
short
choppy
swing
at
the
ball
when
he
went
to
the
clubhouse
after
the
game
in
which
he
struck
out
three
times
he
was
very
quiet
so
i
have
been
told
he
was
just
putting
on
his
last
sock
when
he
clapped
his
hand
to
his
leg
and
exclaimed
i
got
it
got
what
asked
johnny
evers
who
happened
to
be
sitting
next
to
tinker
got
the
way
to
hit
matty
who
had
me
looking
as
if
i
came
from
the
home
for
the
blind
out
there
answered
joe
i
should
say
he
did
replied
evers
but
if
you
found
a
way
to
hit
him
why
i
from
away
out
in
missouri
near
the
ozark
mountains
wait
till
he
pitches
again
said
tinker
by
way
of
conclusion
as
he
took
his
diamond
ring
from
the
trainer
and
left
the
clubhouse
it
was
a
series
in
chicago
and
i
had
struck
tinker
out
three
times
in
the
first
contest
mcgraw
decided
that
i
should
pitch
the
last
game
as
well
two
men
were
on
the
bases
and
two
were
out
when
tinker
came
to
the
bat
for
the
first
time
in
this
battle
and
the
outfielders
moved
in
closer
for
him
as
he
had
always
been
what
is
known
as
a
chop
hitter
i
immediately
noticed
something
different
about
his
style
as
he
set
himself
at
the
plate
and
then
it
struck
me
that
he
was
standing
back
in
the
box
and
had
a
long
bat
before
this
he
had
always
choked
his
bat
short
and
stood
up
close
now
i
observed
that
he
had
his
stick
way
down
by
the
handle
bresnahan
was
catching
and
he
signalled
for
the
regular
prescription
for
tinker
with
a
lot
of
confidence
i
handed
him
that
old
low
curve
he
evidently
expected
it
for
he
stepped
almost
across
the
plate
and
with
that
long
bat
drove
the
ball
to
right
field
for
two
bases
over
the
head
of
george
browne
who
was
playing
close
up
to
the
infield
scoring
both
runs
and
eventually
winning
the
game
i
got
your
number
now
matty
he
shouted
at
me
as
he
drew
up
at
second
base
i
admit
that
he
has
had
it
quite
frequently
since
he
switched
his
batting
style
now
the
outfielders
move
back
when
tinker
comes
to
the
plate
for
if
he
connects
he
hits
far
with
that
long
bat
ever
since
the
day
he
adopted
the
pole
he
has
been
a
thorn
in
my
side
and
has
broken
up
many
a
game
that
old
low
curve
is
his
favorite
now
and
he
reaches
for
it
with
the
same
cordiality
as
is
displayed
by
an
actor
in
reaching
for
his
pay
envelope
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
keep
them
close
and
try
to
outguess
him
but
tinker
is
a
hard
man
to
beat
at
the
game
of
wits
many
a
heady
hitter
in
the
big
league
could
give
the
signs
to
the
opposing
pitcher
for
he
realizes
what
his
weakness
is
and
knows
that
a
twirler
is
going
to
pitch
at
it
but
try
as
hard
as
he
will
he
can
not
often
cover
up
his
groove
as
tinker
did
and
so
he
continues
to
be
easy
for
the
twirler
who
can
put
the
ball
where
he
wants
it
fred
clarke
of
pittsburg
has
always
been
a
hard
man
for
me
to
fool
on
account
of
his
batting
form
a
hitter
of
his
type
can
not
be
deceived
by
a
change
of
pace
because
he
stands
up
close
to
the
plate
chokes
his
bat
short
and
swings
when
a
pitcher
can
not
deceive
a
man
with
a
change
of
pace
he
has
to
depend
on
curves
let
me
digress
briefly
to
explain
why
a
change
of
pace
will
not
make
the
ball
miss
clarke
bat
he
is
naturally
a
hitter
and
likes
the
ball
on
the
outside
corner
of
the
plate
that
means
he
swings
at
the
ball
late
and
makes
most
of
his
drives
to
left
field
how
is
a
batter
fooled
by
a
change
of
pace
a
pitcher
gives
him
a
speedy
one
and
then
piles
a
slow
one
right
on
top
of
it
with
the
same
motion
the
batter
naturally
thinks
it
is
another
fast
ball
and
swings
too
soon
that
is
before
the
ball
gets
to
him
but
when
a
man
like
clarke
is
at
the
bat
and
a
pitcher
tries
to
work
a
change
of
pace
what
is
the
result
he
naturally
swings
late
and
so
hits
a
fast
ball
to
left
field
then
as
the
slow
one
comes
up
to
the
plate
he
strikes
at
it
granted
he
is
deceived
by
it
timing
his
swing
as
he
would
at
a
fast
ball
if
it
had
been
a
fast
ball
as
he
thought
he
would
have
hit
it
to
left
field
being
naturally
a
late
swinger
but
on
a
slow
one
he
swings
clear
around
and
pulls
it
to
right
field
twice
as
hard
as
he
would
have
hit
it
to
left
field
because
he
has
obtained
that
much
more
drive
in
the
longer
swing
therefore
it
is
a
rule
in
the
profession
that
no
batter
who
hits
late
can
be
deceived
by
a
change
of
pace
rube
ellis
a
hitter
of
the
louis
club
entered
the
league
and
heard
complimentary
stories
about
my
pitching
ellis
came
up
to
bat
the
first
day
that
i
pitched
against
him
wondering
if
he
would
get
even
a
foul
he
was
new
to
me
and
i
was
looking
for
his
groove
i
gave
him
one
over
the
outside
corner
and
he
jabbed
it
to
left
field
the
next
time
i
thought
to
work
the
change
of
pace
and
swinging
late
he
hauled
the
ball
around
to
right
field
and
it
nearly
tore
fred
tenny
head
off
en
route
over
first
base
five
hits
out
of
five
times
at
bat
he
made
off
me
that
day
and
when
he
went
to
the
clubhouse
he
remarked
to
his
team
mates
in
this
wise
so
that
is
the
guy
who
has
been
burning
up
this
league
huh
we
got
better
him
in
the
coast
circuit
he
just
got
the
indian
sign
on
you
that
all
i
did
a
little
thinking
about
ellis
hitting
he
used
a
long
bat
and
held
it
down
near
the
end
and
poled
he
was
naturally
a
hitter
and
therefore
swung
late
at
the
ball
i
concluded
that
fast
ones
inside
would
do
for
ellis
and
the
next
time
we
met
he
got
just
those
he
has
been
getting
them
ever
since
and
now
when
he
makes
a
hit
off
me
he
holds
a
celebration
hans
wagner
of
pittsburg
has
always
been
a
hard
man
for
me
but
in
that
i
have
had
nothing
on
a
lot
of
other
pitchers
he
takes
a
long
bat
stands
well
back
from
the
plate
and
steps
into
the
ball
poling
it
he
is
what
is
known
in
baseball
as
a
free
swinger
and
there
are
not
many
free
swingers
these
days
this
is
what
ailed
the
giants
batting
during
the
world
series
in
they
all
attempted
to
become
free
swingers
overnight
and
were
trying
to
knock
the
ball
out
of
the
lot
instead
of
chopping
it
in
the
history
of
baseball
there
have
not
been
more
than
fifteen
or
twenty
free
swingers
altogether
and
they
are
the
real
natural
hitters
of
the
game
the
men
with
eyes
nice
enough
and
accurate
enough
to
take
a
long
wallop
at
the
ball
dan
brouthers
was
one
and
so
was
cap
anson
sherwood
magee
and
hans
wagner
are
contemporary
free
swingers
men
of
this
type
wield
a
heavy
bat
as
if
it
were
a
toothpick
and
step
back
and
forth
in
the
box
hitting
the
ball
on
any
end
of
the
plate
sometimes
it
is
almost
impossible
to
pass
a
man
of
this
sort
purposely
for
a
little
carelessness
in
getting
the
ball
too
close
to
the
plate
may
result
in
his
stepping
up
and
hitting
it
a
mile
pitchers
have
been
searching
for
wagner
groove
for
years
and
if
any
one
of
them
has
located
it
he
has
his
discovery
copyrighted
for
i
never
heard
of
it
only
one
pitcher
that
i
can
recall
always
had
it
on
wagner
and
that
man
was
arthur
raymond
sometimes
called
bugs
he
seemed
to
upset
the
german
by
his
careless
manner
in
the
box
and
by
his
kidding
tactics
i
have
seen
him
make
wagner
go
after
bad
balls
a
thing
that
hans
seldom
can
be
induced
to
do
by
other
twirlers
i
remember
well
the
first
time
i
pitched
against
wagner
jack
warner
was
catching
and
i
young
and
new
in
the
league
had
spent
a
lot
of
time
with
him
learning
the
weaknesses
of
the
batters
and
being
coached
as
to
how
to
treat
them
wagner
loomed
up
at
the
bat
in
a
pinch
and
i
could
not
remember
what
warner
had
said
about
his
flaw
i
walked
out
of
the
box
to
confer
with
the
catcher
what
his
jack
i
asked
him
a
base
on
balls
replied
warner
without
cracking
a
smile
that
always
been
wagner
groove
there
used
to
be
a
player
on
the
boston
team
named
claude
ritchey
who
had
it
on
me
for
some
reason
or
other
he
was
a
hitter
and
naturally
drove
the
ball
to
left
field
so
that
i
could
not
fool
him
with
a
change
of
pace
he
was
always
able
to
outguess
me
in
a
pinch
and
seemed
to
know
by
intuition
what
was
coming
there
has
been
for
a
long
time
an
ardent
follower
of
the
giants
named
wilson
who
raves
wildly
at
a
game
and
is
when
the
team
loses
the
giants
were
playing
in
boston
one
day
and
needed
the
game
very
badly
it
was
back
in
at
the
time
the
club
could
cinch
the
pennant
by
winning
one
contest
and
the
game
is
the
hardest
one
to
win
two
men
got
on
the
bases
in
the
ninth
inning
with
the
score
tied
and
no
one
out
the
crowd
was
stamping
its
feet
and
hooting
madly
trying
to
rattle
me
i
heard
wilson
shrill
loudly
above
the
noise
stick
with
them
matty
ritchey
came
up
to
the
bat
and
i
passed
him
purposely
trying
to
get
him
to
strike
at
a
bad
ball
i
would
take
a
chance
on
letting
him
hit
at
a
good
one
wilson
thought
i
was
losing
my
control
and
unable
to
stand
it
any
longer
she
got
up
and
walked
out
of
the
grounds
then
i
fanned
the
next
two
batters
and
the
last
man
hit
a
roller
to
devlin
and
was
thrown
out
at
first
base
i
was
told
afterwards
that
wilson
stood
outside
the
ground
waiting
to
hear
the
crowd
cheer
which
would
have
told
her
it
was
all
over
she
lingered
at
the
gate
until
the
fourteenth
inning
fearing
to
return
because
she
expected
to
see
us
routed
at
last
she
heard
a
groan
from
the
home
crowd
when
we
won
in
the
fourteenth
still
she
would
not
believe
that
i
had
weathered
the
storm
and
won
the
game
that
gave
the
giants
a
pennant
but
waited
to
be
assured
by
some
of
the
spectators
leaving
the
grounds
before
she
came
around
to
congratulate
us
all
batters
who
are
good
waiters
and
will
not
hit
at
bad
balls
are
hard
to
deceive
because
it
means
a
twirler
has
to
lay
the
ball
over
and
then
the
hitter
always
has
the
better
chance
a
pitcher
will
try
to
get
a
man
to
hit
at
a
bad
ball
before
he
will
put
it
near
the
plate
many
persons
have
asked
me
why
i
do
not
use
my
oftener
when
it
is
so
effective
and
the
only
answer
is
that
every
time
i
throw
the
it
takes
so
much
out
of
my
arm
it
is
a
very
hard
ball
to
deliver
pitching
it
ten
or
twelve
times
in
a
game
kills
my
arm
so
i
save
it
for
the
pinches
many
fans
do
not
know
what
this
ball
really
is
it
is
a
slow
curve
pitched
with
the
motion
of
a
fast
ball
but
most
curve
balls
break
away
from
a
batter
a
little
the
breaks
toward
him
baker
of
the
athletics
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
hitters
i
have
ever
faced
and
we
were
not
warned
to
look
out
for
him
before
the
series
either
certain
friends
of
the
giants
gave
us
some
inside
information
on
the
athletics
hitters
among
others
the
cubs
supplied
us
with
good
tips
but
no
one
spread
the
baker
alarm
i
was
told
to
watch
out
for
collins
as
a
dangerous
man
one
who
was
likely
to
break
up
a
game
any
time
with
a
long
drive
i
consider
baker
one
of
the
hardest
cleanest
hitters
i
have
ever
faced
and
he
drives
the
ball
on
a
line
to
any
field
the
fielders
can
not
play
for
him
he
did
not
show
up
well
in
the
first
game
of
the
world
series
because
the
athletics
thought
they
were
getting
our
signs
and
we
crossed
baker
with
two
men
on
the
bases
in
the
third
inning
he
lost
a
chance
to
be
a
hero
right
there
the
roughest
deal
that
i
got
from
baker
in
the
series
was
in
the
third
game
which
was
the
second
in
new
york
we
had
made
one
run
and
the
ninth
inning
rolled
around
with
the
giants
still
leading
to
the
first
man
at
the
bat
grounded
out
and
then
baker
came
up
i
realized
by
this
time
that
he
was
a
hard
proposition
but
figured
that
he
could
not
hit
a
low
curve
over
the
outside
corner
as
he
is
naturally
a
hitter
i
got
one
ball
and
one
strike
on
him
and
then
delivered
a
ball
that
was
aimed
to
be
a
low
curve
over
the
outside
corner
baker
refused
to
swing
at
it
and
brennan
the
umpire
called
it
a
ball
i
thought
that
it
caught
the
outside
corner
of
the
plate
and
that
brennan
missed
the
strike
it
put
me
in
the
hole
with
the
count
two
balls
and
one
strike
and
i
had
to
lay
the
next
one
over
very
near
the
middle
to
keep
the
count
from
being
three
and
one
i
pitched
a
curve
ball
that
was
meant
for
the
outside
corner
but
cut
the
plate
better
than
i
intended
baker
stepped
up
into
it
and
smashed
it
into
the
in
right
field
for
a
home
run
and
there
is
the
history
of
that
famous
wallop
this
tied
the
score
a
pitcher
has
two
types
of
batters
to
face
one
is
the
man
who
is
always
thinking
and
guessing
and
waiting
trying
to
get
the
pitcher
in
the
hole
evers
of
the
cubs
is
that
sort
they
tell
me
that
ty
cobb
of
detroit
is
the
most
highly
developed
of
this
type
of
hitter
i
have
never
seen
him
play
then
the
other
kind
is
the
natural
slugger
who
does
not
wait
for
anything
and
who
could
not
outguess
a
pitcher
if
he
did
the
brainy
man
is
the
harder
for
a
pitcher
to
face
because
he
is
a
constant
source
of
worry
there
are
two
ways
of
fooling
a
batter
one
is
literally
to
mix
up
and
the
other
is
to
keep
feeding
him
the
same
sort
of
a
ball
but
to
induce
him
to
think
that
something
else
is
coming
when
a
brainy
man
is
at
the
bat
he
is
always
trying
to
figure
out
what
to
expect
if
he
knows
then
his
chances
of
getting
a
hit
are
greatly
increased
for
instance
if
a
batter
has
two
balls
and
two
strikes
on
him
he
naturally
concludes
that
the
pitcher
will
throw
him
a
curve
ball
and
prepares
for
it
big
league
recognize
only
two
kinds
of
pitched
balls
the
curve
and
the
straight
one
when
a
catcher
in
the
big
league
signals
for
a
curved
ball
he
means
a
drop
and
after
handling
a
certain
pitcher
for
a
time
he
gets
to
know
just
how
much
the
ball
is
going
to
curve
that
is
why
the
one
catcher
receives
for
the
same
pitcher
so
regularly
because
they
get
to
work
together
harmoniously
chief
meyers
the
big
indian
catcher
on
the
giants
understands
my
style
so
well
that
in
some
games
he
hardly
has
to
give
a
sign
but
oddly
enough
he
could
never
catch
raymond
because
he
did
not
like
to
handle
the
spit
ball
a
hard
delivery
to
receive
and
raymond
and
he
could
not
get
along
together
as
a
battery
they
would
cross
each
other
but
arthur
wilson
caught
raymond
almost
perfectly
this
explains
the
loss
of
effectiveness
of
many
pitchers
when
a
certain
catcher
is
laid
up
or
out
of
the
game
cy
seymour
formerly
the
outfielder
of
the
giants
was
one
of
the
hardest
batters
i
ever
had
to
pitch
against
when
he
was
with
the
cincinnati
club
and
going
at
the
top
of
his
stride
he
liked
a
curved
ball
and
could
hit
it
hard
and
far
and
was
always
waiting
for
it
he
was
very
clever
at
a
pitcher
and
being
able
to
conclude
what
was
coming
for
a
long
time
whenever
i
pitched
against
him
i
had
mixed
up
literally
handing
him
first
a
fast
ball
and
then
a
slow
curve
and
so
on
trying
to
fool
him
in
this
way
but
one
day
we
were
playing
in
cincinnati
and
i
decided
to
keep
delivering
the
same
kind
of
a
ball
that
old
fast
one
around
his
neck
and
to
try
to
induce
him
to
believe
that
a
curve
was
coming
i
pitched
him
nothing
but
fast
ones
that
day
and
he
was
always
waiting
for
a
curve
the
result
was
that
i
had
him
in
the
hole
all
the
time
and
i
struck
him
out
three
times
he
has
never
gotten
over
it
only
recently
i
saw
seymour
and
he
said
matty
you
are
the
only
man
that
ever
struck
me
out
three
times
in
the
same
game
he
soon
guessed
however
that
i
was
not
really
mixing
them
up
and
then
i
had
to
switch
my
style
again
for
him
some
pitchers
talk
to
batters
a
great
deal
hoping
to
get
their
minds
off
the
game
in
this
way
and
thus
be
able
to
sneak
strikes
over
but
i
find
that
talking
to
a
batter
disconcerts
me
almost
as
much
as
it
does
him
and
i
seldom
do
it
repartee
is
not
my
line
anyway
bender
talked
to
the
giant
players
all
through
that
first
game
in
the
world
series
the
one
in
which
he
wore
the
smile
probably
because
he
was
a
pitcher
old
in
the
game
and
several
of
the
younger
men
on
the
new
york
team
acted
as
if
they
were
nervous
snodgrass
and
the
indian
kept
up
a
running
fire
of
small
talk
every
time
that
the
giants
came
to
the
plate
snodgrass
got
hit
by
pitched
balls
twice
and
this
seemed
to
worry
bender
when
the
new
york
came
to
the
bat
in
the
eighth
inning
the
indian
showed
his
even
teeth
in
the
chronic
grin
and
greeted
snodgrass
in
this
way
look
out
freddie
you
do
get
hit
this
time
then
bender
wound
up
and
with
all
his
speed
drove
the
ball
straight
at
snodgrass
head
and
bender
had
more
speed
in
that
first
game
than
i
ever
saw
him
use
before
snodgrass
dodged
and
the
ball
drove
into
glove
this
pitching
the
first
ball
at
the
head
of
a
batter
is
an
old
trick
of
pitchers
when
they
think
a
player
intends
to
get
hit
purposely
or
that
he
is
crowding
the
plate
if
you
ca
push
over
better
than
that
retorted
snodgrass
i
wo
need
to
get
hit
let
see
your
fast
one
now
try
this
one
suggested
bender
as
he
pitched
another
fast
one
that
cut
the
heart
of
the
plate
snodgrass
swung
and
hit
nothing
but
the
air
the
old
atmosphere
was
very
much
mauled
by
bats
in
that
game
anyway
you
missed
that
one
a
mile
freddie
chuckled
the
indian
with
his
grin
snodgrass
eventually
struck
out
and
then
bender
broke
into
a
laugh
you
ai
a
batter
freddie
exclaimed
the
indian
as
he
walked
to
the
bench
you
a
backstop
you
can
never
get
anywhere
without
being
hit
if
a
pitcher
is
going
to
talk
to
a
batter
he
must
size
up
his
man
an
irritable
nervous
young
player
often
will
fall
for
the
conversation
but
most
seasoned
hitters
will
not
answer
back
the
athletics
other
than
bender
will
not
talk
in
a
game
we
tried
to
get
after
them
in
the
first
contest
in
and
we
could
not
get
a
rise
out
of
one
of
them
except
when
snodgrass
spiked
baker
and
i
want
to
say
right
here
that
this
much
discussed
incident
was
accidental
baker
was
blocking
snodgrass
out
and
the
new
york
player
had
a
perfect
right
to
the
base
line
sherwood
magee
of
the
philadelphia
national
league
team
is
one
of
the
hardest
batters
that
i
ever
have
had
to
face
because
he
has
a
great
eye
and
is
of
the
type
of
free
swingers
who
take
a
mad
wallop
at
the
ball
and
are
always
liable
to
break
up
a
game
with
a
long
drive
just
once
i
talked
to
him
when
he
was
at
the
bat
more
because
we
were
both
worked
up
than
for
any
other
reason
and
he
came
out
second
best
it
was
while
the
giants
were
playing
at
american
league
park
in
after
the
old
polo
grounds
had
burned
welchonce
who
was
the
for
the
phillies
at
the
time
hit
a
slow
one
down
the
first
base
line
and
i
ran
over
to
field
the
ball
i
picked
it
up
as
the
runner
arrived
and
had
no
time
to
straighten
up
to
dodge
him
so
i
struck
out
my
shoulder
and
he
ran
into
it
there
was
no
other
way
to
make
the
play
but
i
guess
it
looked
bad
from
the
stand
because
welchonce
fell
down
magee
came
up
to
bat
next
threw
his
hat
on
the
ground
and
started
to
call
me
names
he
is
bad
when
irritated
and
tolerably
easy
to
irritate
as
shown
by
the
way
in
which
he
knocked
down
finnegan
the
umpire
last
season
because
their
ideas
on
a
strike
differed
slightly
i
replied
on
that
occasion
but
remembered
to
keep
the
ball
away
from
the
centre
of
the
plate
that
is
about
all
i
did
do
but
he
was
more
wrought
up
than
i
and
hit
only
a
slow
grounder
to
the
infield
he
was
out
by
several
feet
he
took
a
wild
slide
at
the
bag
however
feet
first
in
what
looked
like
an
attempt
to
spike
merkle
we
talked
some
more
after
that
but
it
has
all
been
forgotten
now
to
be
a
successful
pitcher
in
the
big
league
a
man
must
have
the
head
and
the
arm
when
i
first
joined
the
giants
i
had
what
is
known
as
the
old
curve
which
is
no
more
than
a
big
slow
outdrop
i
had
been
fooling
them
in
the
minor
leagues
with
it
and
i
was
somewhat
chagrined
when
george
davis
then
the
manager
of
the
club
came
to
me
and
told
me
to
forget
the
curve
as
it
would
be
of
no
use
it
was
then
that
i
began
to
develop
my
drop
ball
a
pitcher
must
watch
all
the
time
for
any
little
unconscious
motion
before
he
delivers
the
ball
if
a
base
runner
can
guess
just
when
he
is
going
to
pitch
he
can
get
a
much
better
start
drucke
used
to
have
a
little
motion
with
his
foot
just
before
he
pitched
of
which
he
himself
was
entirely
unconscious
but
the
other
clubs
got
on
to
it
and
stole
bases
on
him
wildly
mcgraw
has
since
broken
him
of
it
the
athletics
say
that
i
make
a
motion
peculiar
to
the
some
pitchers
announce
when
they
are
going
to
throw
a
moist
one
by
looking
at
the
ball
as
they
dampen
it
at
other
times
when
they
stall
they
do
not
look
at
the
ball
the
big
league
batter
is
watching
for
all
these
little
things
and
if
a
pitcher
is
not
careful
he
will
find
a
lot
of
men
who
are
hard
to
pitch
to
there
are
plenty
anyway
and
as
a
man
grows
older
this
number
increases
season
by
season
ii
take
him
out
a
pitcher
heart
has
been
broken
by
the
cry
from
the
stands
take
him
out
russell
ford
of
the
new
york
yankees
was
once
beaten
by
a
few
foolish
words
whispered
into
the
batter
ear
at
a
critical
moment
why
rube
marquard
failed
for
two
years
to
be
a
big
leaguer
the
art
of
breaking
a
pitcher
into
fast
a
pitcher
is
in
a
tight
game
and
the
batter
makes
a
hit
another
follows
and
some
fan
back
in
the
stand
cries
in
stentorian
tones
take
him
out
it
is
the
dirge
of
baseball
which
has
broken
the
hearts
of
pitchers
ever
since
the
game
began
and
will
continue
to
do
so
as
long
as
it
lives
another
fan
takes
up
the
shout
and
another
and
another
until
it
is
a
chorus
take
him
out
take
him
out
take
him
out
the
pitcher
has
to
grin
but
that
constant
cry
is
wearing
on
nerves
strung
to
the
breaking
point
the
crowd
is
against
him
and
the
next
batter
hits
and
a
run
scores
the
manager
stops
the
game
beckons
to
the
pitcher
from
the
bench
and
he
has
to
walk
away
from
the
box
facing
the
crowd
not
the
team
which
has
beaten
him
it
is
the
psychology
of
baseball
some
foolish
words
once
whispered
into
the
ear
of
a
batter
by
a
clever
manager
in
the
crisis
of
one
of
the
closest
games
ever
played
in
baseball
turned
the
tide
and
unbalanced
a
pitcher
who
had
been
working
like
a
perfectly
adjusted
machine
through
seven
terrific
innings
that
is
also
the
psychology
of
pitching
the
man
was
beaten
because
he
weakened
because
he
lost
his
grip
because
of
any
physical
deficiency
but
because
some
foolish
words
words
that
meant
nothing
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
game
had
upset
his
mental
attitude
the
game
was
the
first
one
played
between
the
giants
and
the
yankees
in
the
series
of
the
batter
was
bridwell
the
manager
was
john
mcgraw
and
the
pitcher
russell
ford
of
the
yankees
the
cast
of
characters
having
been
named
the
story
may
now
enter
the
block
spectators
who
recall
the
game
will
remember
that
the
two
clubs
had
been
battling
through
the
early
innings
with
neither
team
able
to
gain
an
advantage
and
the
giants
came
to
bat
for
the
eighth
inning
with
the
score
a
tie
ford
was
pitching
perfectly
with
all
the
art
of
a
master
craftsman
each
team
had
made
one
run
i
was
the
first
man
up
and
started
the
eighth
inning
with
a
single
because
ford
slackened
up
a
little
against
me
thinking
that
i
was
not
dangerous
devore
beat
out
an
infield
hit
and
doyle
bunted
and
was
safe
filling
the
bases
then
ford
went
to
work
he
struck
out
snodgrass
and
hemphill
caught
murray
fly
far
too
near
the
infield
to
permit
me
to
try
to
score
it
looked
as
if
ford
were
going
to
get
out
of
the
hole
when
al
bridwell
the
former
giant
shortstop
came
to
the
bat
ford
threw
him
two
bad
balls
and
then
mcgraw
ran
out
from
the
bench
and
with
an
autocratic
finger
held
up
the
game
while
he
whispered
into
bridwell
ear
al
nodded
knowingly
and
the
whole
thing
was
a
pantomime
a
wordless
play
that
made
look
like
a
production
bridwell
stepped
back
into
the
batter
box
and
mcgraw
returned
to
the
bench
on
the
next
pitch
al
was
hit
in
the
leg
and
went
to
first
base
forcing
the
run
that
broke
the
tie
across
the
plate
that
run
also
broke
heart
and
here
is
what
mcgraw
whispered
into
the
attentive
ear
of
bridwell
how
many
quail
did
you
say
you
shot
when
you
were
hunting
last
fall
al
john
mcgraw
the
psychologist
baseball
general
and
manager
had
heard
opportunity
knock
with
his
fingers
on
the
pulse
of
the
game
he
had
felt
the
tenseness
of
the
situation
and
realized
all
in
the
flash
of
an
eye
that
ford
was
wabbling
and
that
anything
would
push
him
over
he
stopped
the
game
and
whispered
into
bridwell
ear
while
ford
was
feeling
more
and
more
the
intensity
of
the
crisis
he
had
an
opportunity
to
observe
the
three
men
on
the
bases
he
wondered
what
mcgraw
was
whispering
what
trick
was
to
be
expected
was
he
telling
the
batter
to
get
hit
yes
he
must
be
then
he
did
just
that
hit
the
batter
and
lost
the
game
why
can
certain
pitchers
always
beat
certain
clubs
and
why
do
they
look
like
bush
leaguers
against
others
to
be
concrete
why
can
brooklyn
fight
chicago
so
hard
and
look
foolish
playing
against
the
giants
why
can
the
yankees
take
game
after
game
from
detroit
and
be
easy
picking
for
the
cleveland
club
in
most
of
their
games
why
does
boston
beat
marquard
when
he
can
make
the
hard
philadelphia
hitters
look
like
blind
men
with
bats
in
their
hands
why
could
i
beat
cincinnati
game
after
game
for
two
years
when
the
club
was
filled
with
hard
hitters
it
is
the
psychology
of
baseball
the
mental
attitudes
of
the
players
some
intangible
thing
that
works
on
the
mind
managers
are
learning
to
use
this
subtle
indescribable
element
which
is
such
a
factor
the
great
question
which
confronts
every
big
league
manager
is
how
to
break
a
valuable
young
pitcher
into
the
game
rube
marquard
came
to
the
giants
in
the
fall
of
out
of
the
american
association
heralded
as
a
with
a
reputation
that
shimmered
and
shone
the
newspapers
were
crowded
with
stories
of
the
man
for
whom
mcgraw
had
paid
who
had
been
standing
them
on
their
heads
in
the
west
who
had
curves
that
could
be
touched
and
was
a
bargain
at
the
price
paid
for
him
rube
marquard
came
to
the
giants
in
a
burst
of
glory
and
publicity
when
the
club
was
fighting
for
the
pennant
mcgraw
was
up
against
it
for
pitchers
at
that
time
and
one
win
turned
in
by
a
young
pitcher
might
have
resulted
in
the
giants
winning
the
pennant
as
the
season
ended
do
you
think
marquard
would
win
ca
you
put
him
in
brush
the
owner
of
the
club
asked
mcgraw
one
day
when
he
was
discussing
the
pitching
situation
with
the
manager
i
do
know
answered
mcgraw
if
he
wins
his
first
time
out
in
the
big
leagues
he
will
be
a
and
if
he
loses
it
may
cost
us
a
good
pitcher
but
brush
was
insistent
here
a
big
price
had
been
paid
for
a
pitcher
with
a
record
and
pitchers
were
what
the
club
needed
the
newspapers
declared
that
the
fans
should
get
a
look
at
this
beauty
in
action
a
double
header
was
scheduled
to
be
played
with
the
cincinnati
club
in
the
month
of
september
in
and
the
pitching
staff
was
gone
mcgraw
glanced
over
his
collection
of
crippled
and
twirlers
then
he
saw
rube
marquard
big
and
fresh
go
in
and
pitch
he
ordered
after
marquard
had
warmed
up
mcgraw
always
does
things
that
way
makes
up
his
mind
about
the
most
important
matters
in
a
minute
and
then
stands
by
his
judgment
marquard
went
into
the
box
but
he
did
pitch
much
he
has
told
me
about
it
since
when
i
saw
that
crowd
matty
he
said
i
did
know
where
i
was
it
looked
so
big
to
me
and
they
were
all
wondering
what
i
was
going
to
do
and
all
thinking
that
mcgraw
had
paid
for
me
and
now
they
were
to
find
out
whether
he
had
gotten
stuck
whether
he
had
picked
up
a
gold
brick
with
the
plating
on
it
very
thin
i
was
wondering
myself
whether
i
would
make
good
what
marquard
did
that
day
is
a
matter
of
record
public
property
like
marriage
and
death
notices
kane
the
little
rightfielder
on
the
cincinnati
club
was
the
first
man
up
and
although
he
was
one
of
the
smallest
targets
in
the
league
marquard
hit
him
he
promptly
stole
second
which
worried
rube
some
more
up
came
lobert
the
man
who
broke
marquard
heart
now
we
see
said
lobert
to
rube
as
he
advanced
to
the
plate
whether
you
a
busher
then
lobert
the
tantalizing
teuton
with
the
whacked
out
a
triple
to
the
far
outfield
and
stopped
at
third
with
a
mocking
smile
on
his
face
which
would
have
gotten
the
late
goat
you
identified
said
hans
you
a
busher
some
fan
shouted
the
fatal
take
him
out
marquard
was
gone
bescher
followed
with
another
triple
and
after
that
the
official
scorer
got
writer
cramp
trying
to
keep
track
of
the
hits
and
runs
the
number
of
hits
i
do
think
ever
was
computed
with
any
great
amount
of
exactitude
marquard
was
taken
out
of
the
box
in
the
fifth
inning
and
he
was
two
years
recovering
from
the
shock
of
that
beating
mcgraw
had
put
him
into
the
game
against
his
better
judgment
and
he
paid
for
it
dearly
marquard
had
to
be
nursed
along
on
the
bench
finishing
games
starting
only
against
easy
clubs
and
learning
the
ropes
of
the
big
leagues
before
he
was
able
to
be
a
winning
pitcher
mcgraw
was
a
long
time
realizing
on
his
investment
all
marquard
needed
was
a
victory
a
decisive
win
over
a
strong
club

star
of
the
first
magnitude
fans
of
the
rival
leagues
never
tire
of
discussing
the
relative
merits
of
these
two
great
players
both
are
always
willing
to
take
a
chance
and
seem
to
do
their
best
work
when
pressed
hardest
the
giants
played
a
disastrous
series
with
the
philadelphia
club
early
in
july
and
lost
four
games
straight
all
the
pitchers
were
shot
to
pieces
and
the
quakers
seemed
to
be
unbeatable
mcgraw
was
at
a
loss
for
a
man
to
use
in
the
fifth
game
the
weather
was
steaming
hot
and
the
players
were
dragged
out
while
the
pitching
staff
had
lost
all
its
starch
as
mcgraw
eye
scanned
his
bedraggled
talent
marquard
reading
his
thoughts
walked
up
to
him
give
me
a
chance
he
asked
go
in
answered
mcgraw
again
making
up
his
mind
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
marquard
went
into
the
game
and
made
the
philadelphia
batters
whose
averages
had
been
growing
corpulent
on
the
pitching
of
the
rest
of
the
staff
look
foolish
there
on
that
sweltering
july
afternoon
when
everything
steamed
in
the
blistering
heat
a
pitcher
was
being
born
again
marquard
had
found
himself
and
for
the
rest
of
the
season
he
was
strongest
against
the
philadelphia
team
for
it
had
been
that
club
which
restored
his
confidence
there
is
a
sequel
to
that
old
lobert
incident
too
in
one
of
the
last
series
in
philadelphia
toward
the
end
of
the
season
marquard
and
lobert
faced
each
other
again
said
marquard
remember
the
time
you
dutchman
when
you
asked
me
whether
i
was
a
busher
here
is
where
i
pay
you
back
this
is
the
place
where
you
get
a
bad
showing
up
and
he
fanned
lobert
whiff
whiff
whiff
like
that
he
became
the
greatest
lefthander
in
the
country
and
would
have
been
sooner
except
for
the
enormous
price
paid
for
him
and
the
widespread
publicity
he
received
which
caused
him
to
be
to
make
good
it
the
psychology
of
the
game
you
ca
hit
what
you
do
see
says
joe
tinker
of
pitching
when
he
throws
his
fast
one
the
only
way
you
know
it
past
you
is
because
you
hear
the
ball
hit
the
catcher
glove
fred
clarke
of
the
pittsburg
club
was
up
against
the
same
proposition
when
he
purchased
marty
for
in
the
newspapers
of
the
country
were
filled
with
figures
and
pictures
of
the
real
estate
and
automobiles
that
could
be
bought
with
the
same
amount
of
money
lined
up
alongside
of
pictures
of
as
when
the
comparative
strengths
of
the
navies
of
the
world
are
shown
by
placing
different
sizes
of
battleships
in
a
row
or
when
the
length
of
the
is
emphasized
by
printing
a
picture
of
it
balancing
gracefully
on
its
stern
alongside
the
singer
building
clarke
realized
that
he
had
all
this
publicity
with
which
to
contend
and
that
it
would
do
his
expensive
new
piece
of
pitching
no
good
jerked
out
of
a
minor
league
where
he
had
been
pitching
quietly
along
with
his
name
in
ten
or
a
dozen
papers
was
suddenly
a
national
figure
measuring
up
in
newspaper
space
with
roosevelt
and
taft
and
johnson
when
joined
the
pirates
near
the
end
of
the
season
clarke
knew
down
in
his
heart
the
club
had
no
chance
of
winning
the
pennant
with
wagner
hurt
although
he
still
publicly
declared
he
was
in
the
race
he
did
not
risk
jumping
right
into
the
game
as
soon
as
he
reported
and
taking
the
chance
of
breaking
his
heart
opposing
players
if
they
are
up
in
the
pennant
hunt
are
hard
on
a
pitcher
of
this
sort
and
would
lose
no
opportunity
to
mention
the
price
paid
for
him
and
connect
it
pointedly
with
his
showing
if
that
showing
was
a
little
wobbly
charity
begins
at
home
and
stays
there
in
the
big
leagues
at
least
i
never
saw
any
of
it
on
the
ball
fields
especially
if
the
club
is
in
the
race
and
the
only
thing
that
stands
between
it
and
a
victory
is
the
ruining
of
a
pitcher
of
a
rival
clarke
nursed
along
on
the
bench
for
a
couple
of
weeks
until
he
got
to
be
thoroughly
acclimated
and
then
he
started
him
in
a
game
against
boston
the
weakest
club
in
the
league
after
he
had
sent
for
kelly
regular
catcher
to
inspire
more
confidence
had
an
easy
time
of
it
at
his
big
league
début
for
the
boston
players
did
not
pick
on
him
any
to
speak
of
as
they
were
not
a
very
hard
bunch
of
pickers
the
pittsburg
team
gave
him
a
nice
comfortable
cosy
lead
and
he
was
pitching
along
ahead
of
the
game
all
the
way
in
the
fifth
or
sixth
inning
clarke
slipped
gibson
the
regular
pittsburg
catcher
behind
the
bat
and
had
won
his
first
game
in
the
big
league
before
he
knew
it
he
then
reasoned
i
have
won
here
i
belong
here
i
can
get
along
here
it
much
different
from
the
crowd
i
came
from
except
for
the
name
and
nothing
to
get
timid
about
if
i
can
clean
up
as
easily
as
i
did
fred
clarke
also
a
psychologist
and
baseball
manager
had
worked
a
valuable
pitcher
into
the
league
and
he
had
won
his
first
game
if
he
had
started
him
against
some
club
like
the
giants
for
instance
where
he
would
have
had
to
face
a
big
crowd
and
the
conversation
and
spirit
of
players
who
were
after
a
pennant
and
hot
after
it
he
might
have
lost
and
his
heart
would
have
been
broken
successfully
breaking
into
the
game
an
expensive
pitcher
who
has
cost
a
club
a
large
price
is
one
of
the
hardest
problems
which
confronts
a
manager
now
is
all
right
if
he
has
the
pitching
goods
he
has
taken
his
initial
plunge
and
all
he
has
to
do
is
to
make
good
next
year
the
psychology
element
is
eliminated
from
now
on
i
have
been
told
that
clarke
was
the
most
relieved
man
in
seven
counties
when
came
through
with
that
victory
in
boston
i
had
in
mind
all
the
time
said
fred
what
happened
to
mcgraw
when
he
was
trying
to
introduce
marquard
into
the
smart
set
and
i
was
afraid
the
same
thing
would
happen
to
me
i
had
a
lot
of
confidence
in
the
nerve
of
that
young
fellow
though
because
he
stood
up
well
under
fire
the
first
day
he
got
into
pittsburg
one
of
those
lady
reporters
was
down
to
the
club
offices
to
meet
him
the
morning
he
got
into
town
and
they
always
kind
of
have
me
an
old
campaigner
stepping
away
from
the
plate
she
pulled
her
pad
and
pencil
on
marty
first
thing
before
he
had
had
a
chance
to
knock
the
dirt
out
of
his
cleats
and
said
tell
me
about
yourself
he
stepped
right
into
that
one
instead
of
backing
away
do
you
want
me
to
tell
he
asks
her
then
i
knew
he
was
all
right
he
was
there
with
the
but
the
ideal
way
to
break
a
star
into
the
big
league
is
that
which
marked
the
entrance
of
grover
cleveland
alexander
of
the
philadelphia
club
the
cincinnati
club
had
had
its
eye
on
alexander
for
some
time
but
tacks
ashenbach
the
scout
now
dead
had
advised
against
him
declaring
that
he
would
be
no
good
against
regular
batters
philadelphia
got
him
at
the
waiver
price
and
he
was
among
the
lot
in
the
newspapers
marked
those
who
also
joined
he
started
out
in
and
won
two
or
three
games
before
anyone
paid
any
attention
to
him
then
he
kept
on
winning
until
one
manager
was
saying
to
another
that
guy
alexander
is
a
hard
one
to
beat
he
had
won
ten
or
a
dozen
games
before
it
was
fully
realized
that
he
was
a
star
then
he
was
so
accustomed
to
the
big
league
he
acted
as
if
he
had
been
living
in
it
all
his
life
and
there
was
no
getting
on
his
nerves
when
he
started
he
had
everything
to
gain
and
nothing
to
lose
if
he
did
last
the
newspapers
would
laugh
at
him
and
the
people
say
or
for
a
lemon
that
the
dread
of
all
ball
players
such
is
the
psychology
of
introducing
promising
pitchers
into
the
big
leagues
the
alexander
route
is
the
ideal
one
but
it
hard
to
get
stars
now
without
paying
enormous
prices
for
them
philadelphia
was
lucky
there
is
another
element
which
enters
into
all
forms
of
athletics
tennis
players
call
it
nervousness
and
ball
players
in
the
frankness
of
the
game
call
it
a
yellow
streak
it
is
the
inability
to
stand
the
gaff
the
weakening
in
the
pinches
it
is
something
ingrained
in
a
man
that
ca
be
cured
it
is
the
desire
to
quit
when
the
situation
is
serious
it
is
different
from
stage
fright
because
a
man
may
get
over
that
but
a
yellow
streak
is
always
with
him
when
a
new
player
breaks
into
the
league
he
is
put
to
the
most
severe
test
by
the
other
men
to
see
if
he
is
yellow
if
he
is
found
wanting
he
is
hopeless
in
the
big
league
for
the
news
will
spread
and
he
will
receive
no
quarter
it
is
the
cardinal
sin
in
a
ball
player
for
some
time
after
hans
wagner
poor
showing
in
the
world
series
of
when
the
pittsburg
club
was
defeated
for
the
world
championship
by
the
boston
american
league
club
it
was
reported
that
he
was
yellow
this
grieved
the
dutchman
deeply
for
i
do
know
a
ball
player
in
either
league
who
would
assay
less
quit
to
the
ton
than
wagner
he
is
always
there
and
always
fighting
wagner
felt
the
inference
which
his
team
mates
drew
very
keenly
this
was
the
real
tragedy
in
wagner
career
notwithstanding
his
stolid
appearance
he
is
a
sensitive
player
and
this
hurt
him
more
than
anything
else
in
his
life
ever
has
when
the
pittsburg
club
played
detroit
in
for
the
championship
of
the
world
many
even
of
wagner
admirers
said
the
dutchman
will
quit
it
was
in
this
series
he
vindicated
himself
his
batting
scored
the
majority
of
the
pittsburg
runs
and
his
fielding
was
little
short
of
wonderful
he
was
demonstrating
his
gameness
many
men
would
have
quit
under
the
reflection
they
would
have
been
unable
to
withstand
the
criticism
but
not
wagner
many
persons
implied
that
john
murray
the
rightfielder
on
the
giants
was
yellow
at
the
conclusion
of
the
world
series
because
after
batting
almost
three
hundred
in
the
season
he
did
not
get
a
hit
in
the
six
games
but
there
is
a
man
on
the
team
gamer
he
has
any
nerves
he
one
of
the
sort
of
ball
players
who
says
well
now
i
got
my
chew
of
tobacco
in
my
mouth
let
her
go
there
is
an
interesting
bit
of
psychology
connected
with
wagner
and
the
it
comes
as
near
being
wagner
groove
as
any
curve
that
has
found
its
way
into
the
big
leagues
this
is
explained
by
the
fact
that
the
first
time
wagner
ever
faced
bugs
raymond
he
did
get
a
hit
with
arthur
using
the
spitter
consequently
the
report
went
around
the
circuit
that
wagner
could
hit
the
he
disproved
this
theory
against
two
or
three
pitchers
but
as
long
as
raymond
remained
in
the
league
he
had
it
on
the
dutchman
here
comes
a
hans
look
out
for
it
raymond
would
warn
wagner
with
a
wide
grin
and
then
he
would
pop
up
a
wet
one
guess
i
repeat
on
that
dose
hans
you
did
like
that
one
and
wagner
would
get
so
worked
up
that
he
frequently
struck
out
against
bugs
when
the
rest
of
his
club
was
hitting
the
eccentric
pitcher
hard
it
was
because
he
achieved
the
idea
on
the
first
day
he
could
hit
the
and
he
was
able
to
rid
his
mind
of
the
impression
many
fans
often
wondered
why
raymond
had
it
on
wagner
the
man
whose
only
groove
is
a
base
on
balls
bugs
had
the
edge
after
that
first
day
when
wagner
lost
confidence
in
his
ability
to
hit
the
as
served
by
raymond
in
direct
contrast
to
this
loss
of
confidence
on
wagner
part
was
the
incident
attendant
upon
arthur
devlin
début
into
the
big
league
he
had
joined
the
club
a
youngster
in
the
season
of
and
mcgraw
had
not
counted
upon
him
to
play
third
base
having
planned
to
plant
bresnahan
at
that
corner
but
bresnahan
developed
sciatic
rheumatism
early
in
the
season
and
devlin
was
put
on
the
bag
in
the
emergency
with
a
great
deal
of
misgiving
the
first
day
he
was
in
the
game
he
came
up
to
the
bat
with
the
bases
full
the
giants
were
playing
brooklyn
at
the
polo
grounds
and
two
men
had
already
struck
out
with
the
team
two
runs
behind
devlin
came
out
from
the
bench
who
is
this
party
one
fan
asked
another
as
they
scanned
their
score
cards
devlin
some
busher
taking
bresnahan
place
another
answered
well
it
all
off
now
was
the
general
verdict
the
crowd
settled
back
and
one
could
feel
the
lassitude
in
the
atmosphere
but
devlin
had
his
first
chance
to
make
good
in
a
pinch
there
was
no
weariness
in
his
manner
poole
the
brooklyn
pitcher
showing
less
respect
than
he
should
have
for
the
newcomer
in
baseball
society
spilled
one
over
too
near
the
middle
and
arthur
drove
out
a
home
run
winning
the
game
those
who
had
refused
to
place
any
confidence
in
him
only
a
moment
before
were
on
their
feet
cheering
wildly
now
and
devlin
played
third
base
for
almost
eight
years
after
that
and
none
thought
of
bresnahan
and
his
rheumatism
until
he
began
catching
again
devlin
after
that
home
run
was
oozing
confidence
from
every
pore
and
burned
up
the
league
with
his
batting
for
three
years
he
got
the
old
confidence
from
his
start
the
fans
had
expected
nothing
from
him
and
he
had
delivered
he
had
gained
everything
he
had
made
the
most
dramatic
play
in
baseball
on
his
first
day
a
home
run
with
the
bases
full
when
fred
snodgrass
first
started
playing
as
a
regular
with
the
giants
about
the
middle
of
the
season
of
he
hit
any
ball
pitched
him
hard
and
had
all
the
fans
marvelling
at
his
stick
work
he
believed
that
he
could
hit
anything
and
as
long
as
he
retained
that
belief
he
could
but
the
chalmers
automobile
company
had
offered
a
prize
of
one
nice
motor
car
to
the
batter
in
either
league
who
finished
the
season
with
the
biggest
average
snodgrass
was
batting
over
four
hundred
at
one
time
and
was
ahead
of
them
all
when
suddenly
the
new
york
evening
papers
began
to
publish
the
daily
averages
of
the
leaders
for
the
automobile
boosting
snodgrass
it
suddenly
struck
fred
that
he
was
a
great
batter
and
that
to
keep
his
place
in
that
daily
standing
he
would
have
to
make
a
hit
every
time
he
went
to
the
plate
these
printed
figures
worried
him
his
batting
fell
off
miserably
until
in
the
post
season
series
with
the
yankees
he
gave
one
of
the
worst
exhibitions
of
any
man
on
the
team
the
newspapers
did
it
they
got
me
worrying
about
myself
he
told
me
once
i
began
to
think
how
close
i
was
to
the
car
and
had
a
moving
picture
of
myself
driving
it
that
settled
it
many
promising
young
players
are
broken
in
their
first
game
in
the
big
league
by
the
ragging
which
they
are
forced
to
undergo
at
the
hands
of
veteran
catchers
john
kling
is
a
very
bad
man
with
youngsters
and
sometimes
he
can
get
on
the
nerves
of
older
players
in
close
games
when
the
nerves
are
strung
tight
the
purpose
of
a
catcher
in
talking
to
a
man
in
this
way
is
to
distract
his
attention
from
batting
and
once
this
is
accomplished
he
is
gone
a
favorite
trick
of
a
catcher
is
to
say
to
a
new
batter
look
out
for
this
fellow
he
got
a
mean
ball
and
he
has
any
influence
over
it
there
a
poor
in
the
hospital
now
that
stopped
one
with
his
head
then
the
catcher
signs
for
the
pitcher
to
throw
the
next
one
at
the
young
batter
head
if
he
pulls
away
an
unpardonable
sin
in
baseball
the
dose
is
repeated
yer
almost
had
your
foot
in
the
over
by
the
bench
that
time
says
the
catcher
bing
up
comes
another
beaner
then
after
the
catcher
has
sized
the
new
man
up
he
makes
his
report
he
wo
do
he
yellow
and
the
players
keep
mercilessly
after
this
shortcoming
this
ingrained
fault
which
unlike
a
mechanical
error
can
not
be
corrected
until
the
new
player
is
driven
out
of
the
league
perhaps
the
catcher
says
he
game
that
guy
no
scare
to
him
after
that
he
is
let
alone
it
the
psychology
of
batting
once
when
i
first
broke
into
the
league
jack
chesbro
then
with
pittsburg
threw
a
fast
one
up
and
it
went
behind
my
head
although
i
tried
to
dodge
back
he
had
lots
of
speed
in
those
days
too
it
set
me
wondering
what
would
have
happened
if
the
ball
had
hit
me
the
more
i
thought
the
more
it
struck
me
that
it
would
have
greatly
altered
my
face
had
it
gotten
into
the
course
of
the
ball
ever
afterwards
he
had
it
on
me
and
for
months
a
fast
one
at
the
head
had
me
backing
away
from
the
plate
in
contrast
to
this
experience
of
mine
was
the
curing
of
josh
devore
the
leftfielder
of
the
giants
of
being
bat
shy
against
devore
has
always
been
very
weak
at
the
bat
with
a
southpaw
in
the
box
dragging
his
right
foot
away
from
the
plate
this
was
particularly
the
case
against
slim
sallee
the
tenuous
southpaw
of
the
louis
nationals
finally
mcgraw
exasperated
after
josh
had
struck
out
twice
in
one
day
said
that
fellow
has
got
speed
enough
to
bend
a
pane
of
glass
at
the
home
plate
throwing
from
the
box
and
you
pullin
away
as
if
he
was
shooting
them
out
of
a
gun
it
a
crime
to
let
him
beat
you
go
up
there
the
next
time
and
get
hit
and
see
if
he
can
hurt
you
if
you
do
get
hit
you
fined
devore
who
is
as
fond
of
as
the
next
one
went
to
the
bat
and
took
one
of
sallee
slants
in
a
place
where
it
would
do
the
least
damage
he
trotted
to
first
base
smiling
what
i
tell
you
asked
mcgraw
coaching
could
he
hurt
you
say
replied
josh
i
hire
out
to
let
them
pitch
baseballs
at
me
if
none
could
throw
harder
than
that
guy
devore
was
cured
of
being
bat
shy
when
sallee
was
pitching
right
then
and
there
and
he
has
improved
greatly
against
all
ever
since
so
much
so
that
mcgraw
leaves
him
in
the
game
now
when
a
southpaw
pitches
instead
of
placing
beals
becker
in
left
field
as
he
used
to
all
devore
needed
was
the
confidence
to
stand
up
to
the
plate
against
them
to
rid
his
mind
of
the
idea
that
if
once
he
got
hit
he
would
leave
the
field
feet
first
that
slam
in
the
slats
which
sallee
handed
him
supplied
the
confidence
when
devore
was
going
to
philadelphia
for
the
second
game
of
the
series
in
the
fall
of
the
first
one
in
the
other
town
he
was
introduced
to
ty
cobb
the
detroit
by
some
newspaper
man
on
the
train
and
as
it
was
the
first
time
devore
had
ever
met
cobb
he
sat
down
with
him
and
they
talked
all
the
way
over
gee
said
josh
to
me
as
we
were
getting
off
the
train
that
fellow
cobb
knows
a
lot
about
batting
he
told
me
some
things
about
the
american
league
pitchers
just
now
and
he
did
know
he
was
doing
it
i
never
let
on
but
i
just
hope
that
fellow
plank
works
if
they
think
that
i
am
weak
against
say
matty
i
could
write
a
book
about
that
guy
and
his
now
after
buzzing
cobb
and
the
funny
thing
is
he
did
know
he
was
telling
me
plank
pitched
that
day
and
fanned
devore
four
times
out
of
a
possible
four
josh
did
even
get
a
foul
off
him
thought
you
knew
all
about
that
fellow
i
said
to
devore
after
the
game
i
learned
since
that
cobb
and
he
are
pretty
thick
replied
josh
and
i
guess
was
giving
me
a
bad
steer
it
was
evident
that
cobb
had
been
filling
josh
up
with
misinformation
that
was
working
around
in
devore
mind
when
he
went
to
the
plate
to
face
plank
and
instead
of
being
open
to
impressions
these
wrong
opinions
had
already
been
planted
and
he
was
constantly
trying
to
confirm
them
plank
was
crossing
him
all
the
time
and
being
naturally
weak
against
this
additional
handicap
made
devore
look
foolish
in
the
words
of
dooley
it
has
been
my
experience
to
trust
your
friends
but
cut
the
cards
by
that
i
mean
one
ball
player
will
often
come
to
another
with
a
tip
that
he
really
thinks
worth
while
but
that
avails
nothing
in
the
end
a
man
has
to
be
a
pretty
smart
ball
player
to
dispense
accurate
information
about
others
because
the
big
leaguers
know
their
own
grooves
and
are
naturally
trying
to
cover
them
up
then
a
batter
may
be
weak
against
one
pitcher
on
a
certain
kind
of
a
ball
and
may
whale
the
same
sort
of
delivery
with
a
different
twist
to
it
out
of
the
lot
against
another
that
was
the
experience
i
had
with
ed
delehanty
the
famous
slugger
of
the
old
philadelphia
national
league
team
who
is
now
dead
during
my
first
year
in
the
league
several
advisers
came
to
me
and
said
do
give
any
high
fast
ones
because
if
you
do
you
will
just
wear
your
fielders
out
worse
than
a
george
cohan
show
does
the
chorus
they
will
think
they
are
in
a
marathon
race
instead
of
a
ball
game
being
young
i
took
this
advice
and
the
first
time
i
pitched
against
delehanty
i
fed
him
curved
balls
he
hit
these
so
far
the
first
two
times
he
came
to
bat
that
one
of
the
balls
was
never
found
and
everybody
felt
like
shaking
hands
with
van
haltren
the
old
giant
outfielder
when
he
returned
with
the
other
as
if
he
had
been
away
on
a
vacation
some
place
in
fact
i
had
been
warned
against
giving
any
of
this
philadelphia
team
of
sluggers
high
fast
ones
and
i
had
been
delivering
a
diet
of
curves
to
all
of
them
which
they
were
sending
to
the
limits
of
the
park
and
further
with
great
regularity
at
last
when
delehanty
came
to
the
bat
for
the
third
time
in
the
game
van
haltren
walked
into
the
box
from
the
outfield
and
handed
the
ball
to
me
after
he
had
just
gone
to
the
fence
to
get
it
elmer
flick
had
hit
it
there
matty
he
pleaded
for
the
love
of
mike
slip
this
fellow
a
base
on
balls
and
let
me
get
my
wind
instead
i
decided
to
switch
my
style
and
i
fed
delehanty
high
fast
ones
the
dangerous
dose
and
he
struck
out
then
and
later
he
was
expecting
them
and
was
so
surprised
that
he
could
hit
the
ball
only
two
of
the
six
balls
at
which
he
struck
were
good
ones
i
found
out
afterwards
that
the
tradition
about
not
delivering
any
high
fast
balls
to
the
philadelphia
hitters
was
the
outgrowth
of
the
old
buzzer
tipping
service
established
in
by
which
the
batters
were
informed
what
to
expect
by
morgan
murphy
located
in
the
clubhouse
with
a
pair
of
and
his
finger
on
a
button
which
worked
a
buzzer
under
the
coaching
box
the
coacher
tipped
the
batter
off
what
was
coming
and
the
device
had
worked
perfectly
the
hitters
had
all
waited
for
the
high
fast
ones
in
those
days
as
they
can
be
hit
easier
if
a
man
knows
that
they
are
coming
and
can
also
be
hit
farther
but
after
the
buzzer
had
been
discovered
and
the
delivery
of
pitchers
could
not
be
accurately
forecast
this
ability
to
hit
high
fast
ones
vanished
but
not
the
tradition
the
result
was
that
this
philadelphia
club
was
getting
a
steady
diet
of
curves
and
hitting
them
hard
not
expecting
anything
else
when
i
first
pitched
against
delehanty
his
reputation
as
a
hitter
gave
him
a
big
edge
on
me
therefore
i
was
willing
to
take
any
kind
of
advice
calculated
to
help
me
but
eventually
i
had
to
find
out
for
myself
if
i
had
taken
a
chance
on
mixing
them
up
the
first
time
he
faced
me
i
still
doubt
if
he
would
have
made
those
two
long
hits
but
it
was
his
reputation
working
in
my
mind
and
the
idea
that
he
ate
up
high
fast
balls
that
prevented
me
from
taking
the
risk
each
pitcher
has
to
find
out
for
himself
what
a
man
is
going
to
hit
all
right
to
take
advice
at
first
but
if
this
does
not
prove
to
be
the
proper
prescription
it
up
to
him
to
experiment
and
not
continue
to
feed
him
the
sort
of
balls
that
he
is
hitting
reputations
count
for
a
great
deal
in
the
big
leagues
cobb
has
a
record
as
being
a
great
base
runner
and
i
believe
that
he
steals
ten
bases
a
season
on
this
reputation
the
catcher
knows
he
is
on
the
bag
realizes
that
he
is
going
to
steal
fears
him
hurries
his
throw
and
in
his
anxiety
it
goes
bad
cobb
is
safe
whereas
if
he
had
been
an
ordinary
runner
with
no
reputation
he
would
probably
have
been
thrown
out
pitchers
who
have
made
names
for
themselves
in
the
big
leagues
have
a
much
easier
time
winning
as
a
consequence
all
he
got
to
do
is
to
throw
his
glove
into
the
box
to
beat
that
club
is
an
old
expression
in
baseball
which
means
that
the
opposing
batters
fear
the
pitcher
and
that
his
reputation
will
carry
him
through
if
he
has
nothing
whatever
on
the
ball
newspapers
work
on
the
mental
attitude
of
big
league
players
this
has
been
most
marked
in
cincinnati
and
i
believe
that
the
local
newspapers
have
done
as
much
as
anything
to
keep
a
pennant
away
from
that
town
when
the
team
went
south
for
the
spring
practice
the
newspapers
printed
glowing
reports
of
the
possibilities
of
the
club
winning
the
pennant
but
when
the
club
started
to
fall
down
in
the
race
they
would
knock
the
men
and
it
would
take
the
heart
out
of
the
players
almost
enough
good
players
have
been
let
go
by
the
cincinnati
team
to
make
a
world
championship
club
there
are
donlin
seymour
steinfeldt
lobert
and
many
more
ball
players
inhale
the
accounts
printed
in
the
newspapers
and
a
correspondent
with
a
grouch
has
ruined
the
prospects
of
many
a
good
player
and
club
the
new
york
newspapers
first
by
the
great
amount
of
publicity
given
to
his
old
record
and
then
by
criticising
him
for
not
making
a
better
showing
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
marquard
failing
to
make
good
the
first
two
years
he
was
in
new
york
as
i
have
shown
a
smart
manager
in
the
big
league
is
always
working
to
keep
his
valuable
stars
in
the
right
frame
of
mind
on
the
last
western
trip
the
giants
made
in
the
season
of
when
they
won
the
pennant
by
taking
eighteen
games
out
of
games
mcgraw
refused
to
permit
any
of
the
men
to
play
cards
he
realized
that
often
the
stakes
ran
high
and
that
the
losers
brooded
over
the
money
which
they
lost
and
were
thinking
of
this
rather
than
the
game
when
on
the
ball
field
it
hurt
their
playing
so
there
were
no
cards
he
also
carried
charley
faust
the
kansas
jinx
killer
along
to
keep
the
players
amused
and
because
it
was
thought
that
he
was
good
luck
it
helped
their
mental
attitude
the
treatment
of
a
new
player
when
he
first
arrives
is
different
now
from
what
it
was
in
the
old
days
once
there
was
a
time
when
the
veteran
looked
upon
the
recruit
with
suspicion
and
the
feeling
that
he
had
come
to
take
his
job
and
his
bread
and
butter
from
him
if
a
young
pitcher
was
put
into
the
box
the
old
catcher
would
do
all
that
he
could
to
irritate
him
and
many
times
he
would
inform
the
batters
of
the
other
side
what
he
was
going
to
throw
he
tryin
to
horn
my
friend
bill
out
of
a
job
i
have
heard
catchers
charge
against
a
youngster
this
attitude
drove
many
a
star
ball
player
back
to
the
minors
because
he
could
make
good
under
the
adverse
circumstances
but
nothing
of
the
sort
exists
now
each
veteran
does
all
that
he
can
to
help
the
youngster
realizing
that
on
the
younger
generation
depends
the
success
of
the
club
and
that
no
one
makes
any
money
by
being
on
a
loser
travelling
with
a
ball
club
is
the
poorest
pastime
in
the
world
i
would
rather
ride
in
the
first
coach
of
a
funeral
procession
the
youngster
is
treated
more
courteously
now
when
he
first
arrives
in
the
old
days
the
veterans
of
the
club
sized
up
the
recruit
and
treated
him
like
a
stranger
for
days
which
made
him
feel
as
if
he
were
among
enemies
instead
of
friends
and
as
a
result
it
was
much
harder
for
him
to
make
good
now
all
hands
make
him
a
companion
from
the
start
unless
he
shows
signs
of
being
unusually
fresh
there
is
a
lot
to
baseball
in
the
big
leagues
besides
playing
the
game
no
man
can
have
a
yellow
streak
and
last
he
must
not
pay
much
attention
to
his
nerves
or
temperament
he
must
hide
every
flaw
it
all
part
of
the
psychology
of
baseball
but
the
saddest
words
of
all
to
a
pitcher
are
three
take
him
out
iii
pitching
in
a
pinch
pitchers
are
effective
in
a
big
league
ball
game
until
that
moment
arrives
known
as
the
pinch
it
is
then
that
the
man
in
the
box
is
put
to
the
severest
test
by
the
coachers
and
the
players
on
the
bench
victory
or
defeat
hangs
on
his
work
in
that
inning
famous
pinches
in
most
big
league
ball
games
there
comes
an
inning
on
which
hangs
victory
or
defeat
certain
intellectual
fans
call
it
the
crisis
college
professors
interested
in
the
sport
have
named
it
the
psychological
moment
big
league
managers
mention
it
as
the
break
and
pitchers
speak
of
the
pinch
this
is
the
time
when
each
team
is
straining
every
nerve
either
to
win
or
to
prevent
defeat
the
players
and
spectators
realize
that
the
outcome
of
the
inning
is
of
vital
importance
and
in
most
of
these
pinches
the
real
burden
falls
on
the
pitcher
it
is
at
this
moment
that
he
is
putting
all
he
has
on
the
ball
and
simultaneously
his
opponents
are
doing
everything
they
can
to
disconcert
him
managers
wait
for
this
break
and
the
shrewd
league
leader
can
often
time
it
frequently
a
certain
style
of
play
is
adopted
to
lead
up
to
the
pinch
then
suddenly
a
slovenly
mode
of
attack
is
changed
and
the
team
comes
on
with
a
rush
in
an
effort
to
break
up
the
game
that
is
the
real
test
of
a
pitcher
he
must
be
able
to
live
through
these
squalls
two
evenly
matched
clubs
have
been
playing
through
six
innings
with
neither
team
gaining
any
advantage
let
us
say
that
they
are
the
giants
and
the
chicago
cubs
suddenly
the
chicago
pitcher
begins
to
weaken
in
the
seventh
spectators
can
not
perceive
this
but
mcgraw
the
giants
manager
has
detected
some
crack
all
has
been
quiet
on
the
bench
up
to
this
moment
now
the
men
begin
to
fling
about
sweaters
and
move
around
one
going
to
the
water
cooler
to
get
a
drink
another
picking
up
a
bat
or
two
and
flinging
them
in
the
air
while
four
or
five
prospective
hitters
are
lined
up
swinging
several
sticks
apiece
as
if
absolutely
confident
that
each
will
get
his
turn
at
the
plate
the
two
coachers
on
the
side
lines
have
become
dancing
dervishes
waving
sweaters
and
arms
wildly
and
shouting
various
words
of
discouragement
to
the
pitcher
which
are
calculated
to
make
his
job
as
soft
as
a
bed
of
concrete
he
has
pitched
three
balls
to
the
batter
and
mcgraw
vehemently
protests
to
the
umpire
that
the
twirler
is
not
keeping
his
foot
on
the
slab
the
game
is
delayed
while
this
is
discussed
at
the
pitcher
box
and
the
umpire
brushes
off
the
rubber
strip
with
a
whisk
broom
there
is
a
kick
against
these
tactics
from
the
other
bench
but
the
damage
has
been
done
the
pitcher
passes
the
batter
forgets
what
he
ought
to
throw
to
the
next
man
and
can
not
get
the
ball
where
he
wants
it
a
base
hit
follows
then
he
is
gone
the
following
batter
triples
and
before
another
pitcher
can
be
warmed
up
three
or
four
runs
are
across
the
plate
and
the
game
is
won
that
explains
why
so
many
wise
managers
keep
a
pitcher
warming
up
when
the
man
in
the
box
is
going
strong
it
is
in
the
pinch
that
the
pitcher
shows
whether
or
not
he
is
a
big
leaguer
he
must
have
something
besides
curves
then
he
needs
a
head
and
he
has
to
use
it
it
is
the
acid
test
that
is
the
reason
so
many
men
who
shine
in
the
minor
leagues
fail
to
make
good
in
the
majors
they
can
not
stand
the
fire
a
young
pitcher
came
to
the
giants
a
few
years
ago
i
wo
mention
his
name
because
he
has
been
pitching
good
ball
since
he
was
a
wonder
with
the
bases
empty
but
let
a
man
or
two
get
on
the
sacks
and
he
would
know
whether
he
was
in
a
pitcher
box
or
learning
aviation
in
the
wright
school
and
he
acted
a
lot
more
like
an
aviator
in
the
crisis
mcgraw
looked
him
over
twice
he
got
a
spine
like
a
charlotte
russe
declared
mac
after
his
second
peek
and
he
passed
him
back
to
the
bushes
several
other
big
league
managers
tempted
by
this
man
brilliant
record
in
the
minors
have
tried
him
out
since
but
he
has
always
gone
back
mcgraw
judgment
of
the
man
was
correct
on
the
other
hand
otis
crandall
came
to
the
new
york
club
a
few
years
ago
a
raw
country
boy
from
indiana
i
shall
never
forget
how
he
looked
the
first
spring
i
saw
him
in
texas
the
club
had
a
large
number
of
recruits
and
was
short
of
uniforms
he
was
among
the
last
of
the
hopefuls
to
arrive
and
there
was
no
suit
for
him
so
in
a
pair
of
regular
trousers
with
his
coat
off
he
began
chasing
flies
in
the
outfield
his
head
hung
down
on
his
chest
and
when
not
playing
a
cigarette
drooped
out
of
the
corner
of
his
mouth
but
he
turned
out
to
be
a
very
good
fly
chaser
and
mcgraw
admired
his
persistency
what
are
you
mcgraw
asked
him
one
day
a
pitcher
replied
crandall
two
words
constitute
an
oration
for
him
let
see
what
you
got
said
mcgraw
crandall
warmed
up
and
he
did
have
much
of
anything
besides
a
sweeping
outcurve
and
a
good
deal
of
speed
he
looked
less
like
a
pitcher
than
any
of
the
spring
crop
but
mcgraw
saw
something
in
him
and
kept
him
the
result
is
he
has
turned
out
to
be
one
of
the
most
valuable
men
on
the
club
because
he
is
there
in
a
pinch
he
could
be
disturbed
if
the
mcnamaras
tied
a
bomb
to
him
with
a
time
fuse
on
it
set
for
at
once
he
is
the
sort
of
pitcher
who
is
best
when
things
look
darkest
i
heard
the
crowd
yelling
when
he
has
been
pitching
on
the
enemy
ground
so
that
a
gun
could
have
been
heard
if
it
had
gone
off
in
the
lot
that
crowd
was
making
some
noise
i
said
to
crandall
after
the
inning
was
it
asked
otie
i
did
notice
it
one
day
in
he
started
a
game
in
philadelphia
and
three
men
got
on
the
bases
with
no
one
out
along
about
the
fourth
or
fifth
inning
he
shut
them
out
without
a
run
it
was
the
first
game
he
had
started
for
a
long
while
his
specialty
having
been
to
enter
a
contest
after
some
other
pitcher
had
gotten
into
trouble
with
two
or
three
men
on
the
bases
and
scarcely
any
one
out
after
he
came
to
the
bench
with
the
threatening
inning
behind
him
he
said
to
me
matty
i
did
feel
at
home
out
there
until
a
lot
of
people
got
on
the
bases
i
be
all
right
now
and
he
was
i
believe
that
crandall
is
the
best
pitcher
in
a
pinch
in
the
national
league
and
one
of
the
most
valuable
men
to
a
team
for
he
can
play
any
position
and
bats
hard
besides
being
a
great
pinch
pitcher
he
can
also
hit
in
a
crush
and
won
many
games
for
the
giants
in
that
way
very
often
spectators
think
that
a
pitcher
has
lost
his
grip
in
a
pinch
when
really
he
is
playing
inside
baseball
a
game
with
chicago
in
chicago
back
in
not
the
famous
contest
that
cost
the
giants
a
championship
i
did
not
have
any
grip
at
all
that
day
but
one
earlier
in
the
season
best
illustrates
the
point
i
want
to
bring
out
mordecai
brown
and
i
were
having
a
pitchers
duel
and
the
giants
were
in
the
lead
by
the
score
of
to
when
the
team
took
the
field
for
the
ninth
inning
it
was
one
of
those
fragile
games
in
which
one
run
makes
a
lot
of
difference
the
sort
that
has
a
fringe
of
nervous
prostration
for
the
spectators
chance
was
up
first
in
the
ninth
and
he
pushed
a
base
hit
to
right
field
steinfeldt
followed
with
a
triple
that
brought
chance
home
and
left
the
run
which
would
win
the
game
for
the
cubs
on
third
base
the
crowd
was
shouting
like
mad
thinking
i
was
done
i
looked
at
the
hitters
waiting
to
come
up
and
saw
hofman
and
tinker
swinging
their
bats
in
anticipation
both
are
dangerous
men
but
the
silver
lining
was
my
second
look
which
revealed
to
me
kling
and
brown
following
hofman
and
tinker
without
a
second
hesitation
i
decided
to
pass
both
hofman
and
tinker
because
the
run
on
third
base
would
win
the
game
anyway
if
it
scored
and
with
three
men
on
the
bags
instead
of
one
there
would
be
a
remote
chance
for
a
triple
play
besides
making
a
force
out
at
the
plate
possible
remember
that
no
one
was
out
at
this
time
kling
and
brown
had
always
been
easy
for
me
when
i
got
two
balls
on
hofman
trying
to
make
him
hit
at
a
bad
one
the
throng
stood
up
in
the
stand
and
tore
splinters
out
of
the
floor
with
its
feet
and
then
i
passed
hofman
the
spectators
misunderstood
my
motive
he
done
he
all
in
shouted
one
man
in
a
voice
which
was
one
of
the
carrying
persistent
penetrating
sort
the
crowd
took
the
cry
up
and
stamped
its
feet
and
cheered
wildly
then
i
passed
tinker
a
man
as
i
have
said
before
who
has
had
a
habit
of
making
trouble
for
me
the
crowd
quieted
down
somewhat
perhaps
because
it
was
not
possible
for
it
to
cheer
any
louder
but
probably
because
the
spectators
thought
that
now
it
would
be
only
a
matter
of
how
many
the
cubs
would
win
by
the
bases
were
full
and
no
one
was
out
but
that
wildly
cheering
crowd
had
worked
me
up
to
greater
effort
and
i
struck
kling
out
and
then
brown
followed
him
back
to
the
bench
for
the
same
reason
just
one
batter
stood
between
me
and
a
tied
score
now
he
was
john
evers
and
the
crowd
having
lost
its
chortle
of
victory
was
begging
him
to
make
the
hit
which
would
bring
just
one
run
over
the
plate
they
were
surprised
by
my
recuperation
after
having
passed
two
men
evers
lifted
a
gentle
fly
to
left
field
and
the
three
men
were
left
on
the
bases
the
giants
eventually
won
that
game
in
the
eleventh
inning
by
the
score
of
to
but
that
system
does
always
work
often
i
have
passed
a
man
to
get
a
supposedly
poor
batter
up
and
then
had
him
bang
out
a
base
hit
my
first
successful
year
in
the
national
league
was
although
i
joined
the
giants
in
the
middle
of
the
season
of
the
boston
club
at
that
time
had
a
pitcher
named
kid
nichols
who
was
a
great
twirler
the
first
two
games
i
pitched
against
the
boston
club
were
against
this
man
and
i
won
the
first
in
boston
and
the
second
in
new
york
the
latter
by
the
score
of
to
both
teams
then
went
west
for
a
three
weeks
trip
and
when
the
giants
returned
a
series
was
scheduled
with
boston
at
the
polo
grounds
there
was
a
good
deal
of
speculation
as
to
whether
i
would
again
beat
the
veteran
kid
nichols
and
the
newspapers
discussing
the
promised
pitching
duel
stirred
up
considerable
enthusiasm
over
it
of
course
i
the
youngster
was
eager
to
make
it
three
straight
over
the
veteran
neither
team
had
scored
at
the
beginning
of
the
eighth
inning
boston
runners
got
on
second
and
third
bases
with
two
out
and
fred
tenney
then
playing
first
base
on
the
boston
club
was
up
at
the
bat
he
had
been
hitting
me
hard
that
day
and
i
decided
to
pass
him
and
take
a
chance
on
dick
cooley
the
next
man
and
a
weak
batter
so
tenney
got
his
base
on
balls
and
the
sacks
were
full
two
strikes
were
gathered
on
cooley
one
at
which
he
swung
and
the
other
called
and
i
was
beginning
to
congratulate
myself
on
my
excellent
judgment
which
was
really
counting
my
chickens
while
they
were
still
in
the
incubator
i
attempted
to
slip
a
fast
one
over
on
cooley
and
got
the
ball
a
little
too
high
the
result
was
that
he
stepped
into
it
and
made
a
three
base
hit
which
eventually
won
the
game
by
the
score
of
to
that
was
once
when
passing
a
man
to
get
a
weak
batter
did
not
work
i
have
always
been
against
a
twirler
pitching
himself
out
when
there
is
no
necessity
for
it
as
so
many
youngsters
do
they
burn
them
through
for
eight
innings
and
then
when
the
pinch
comes
something
is
lacking
a
pitcher
must
remember
that
there
are
eight
other
men
in
the
game
drawing
more
or
less
salary
to
stop
balls
hit
at
them
and
he
must
have
confidence
in
them
some
pitchers
will
put
all
that
they
have
on
each
ball
this
is
foolish
for
two
reasons
in
the
first
place
it
exhausts
the
man
physically
and
when
the
pinch
comes
he
has
not
the
strength
to
last
it
out
but
second
and
more
important
it
shows
the
batters
everything
that
he
has
which
is
senseless
a
man
should
always
hold
something
in
reserve
a
surprise
to
spring
when
things
get
tight
if
a
pitcher
has
displayed
his
whole
assortment
to
the
batters
in
the
early
part
of
the
game
and
has
used
all
his
speed
and
his
fastest
breaking
curve
then
when
the
crisis
comes
he
has
anything
to
fall
back
on
like
all
youngsters
i
was
eager
to
make
a
record
during
my
first
year
in
the
big
league
and
in
one
of
the
first
games
i
pitched
against
cincinnati
i
made
the
mistake
of
putting
all
that
i
had
on
every
ball
we
were
playing
at
the
polo
grounds
and
the
giants
had
the
visitors
beaten
to
going
into
the
last
inning
i
had
been
popping
them
through
trying
to
strike
out
every
hitter
and
had
not
held
anything
in
reserve
the
first
man
to
the
bat
in
the
ninth
got
a
single
the
next
a
two
bagger
and
by
the
time
they
had
stopped
hitting
me
the
scorer
had
credited
the
cincinnati
club
with
four
runs
and
we
lost
the
game
to
i
was
very
much
down
in
the
mouth
over
the
defeat
after
i
had
the
game
apparently
won
and
george
davis
then
the
manager
of
the
giants
noticed
it
in
the
clubhouse
never
mind
matty
he
said
it
was
worth
it
the
game
ought
to
teach
you
not
to
pitch
your
head
off
when
you
do
need
to
it
did
i
have
never
forgotten
that
lesson
many
spectators
wonder
why
a
pitcher
does
not
work
as
hard
as
he
can
all
through
the
game
instead
of
just
in
the
pinches
if
he
did
they
argue
there
would
be
no
pinches
but
there
would
be
and
if
the
pitcher
did
not
conserve
his
energy
the
pinches
would
usually
go
against
him
sometimes
bawling
at
a
man
in
a
pinch
has
the
opposite
effect
from
that
desired
clarke
griffith
recently
of
cincinnati
has
a
reputation
in
the
big
leagues
for
being
a
bad
man
to
upset
a
pitcher
from
the
coacher
box
off
the
field
he
is
one
of
the
decentest
fellows
in
the
game
but
when
talking
to
a
pitcher
he
is
very
irritating
i
was
working
in
a
game
against
the
reds
in
cincinnati
one
day
just
after
he
had
been
made
manager
of
the
club
and
griffith
spent
the
afternoon
and
a
lot
of
breath
trying
to
get
me
going
the
giants
were
ahead
to
at
the
beginning
of
the
seventh
in
the
cincinnati
half
of
that
inning
mike
mitchell
tripled
with
the
bases
full
and
later
tallied
on
an
outfield
fly
which
tied
the
score
the
effect
this
had
on
griffith
was
much
the
same
as
that
of
a
lighted
match
on
gasolene
now
you
big
blond
he
shouted
at
me
we
got
you
at
last
i
expected
mcgraw
to
take
me
out
as
it
looked
in
that
inning
as
if
i
was
not
right
but
he
did
not
and
i
pitched
along
up
to
the
ninth
with
the
score
still
tied
and
with
griffith
the
carping
critic
on
the
side
lines
we
failed
to
count
in
our
half
but
the
first
cincinnati
batter
got
on
the
bases
stole
second
and
went
to
third
on
a
sacrifice
he
was
there
with
one
out
here
where
we
get
you
chortled
griffith
this
is
the
point
at
which
you
receive
a
terrible
showing
up
i
tried
to
get
the
next
batter
to
hit
at
bad
balls
and
he
refused
so
that
i
lost
him
i
was
afraid
to
lay
the
ball
over
the
plate
in
this
crisis
as
a
hit
or
an
outfield
fly
meant
the
game
hoblitzell
and
mitchell
two
of
griffith
heaviest
batters
were
scheduled
to
arrive
at
the
plate
next
you
ought
to
be
up
mike
yelled
the
cincinnati
manager
at
mitchell
who
was
swinging
a
couple
of
sticks
preparatory
to
his
turn
at
the
bat
too
bad
you
wo
get
a
lick
old
man
because
hobby
going
to
break
it
up
right
here
something
he
said
irritated
me
but
instead
of
worrying
me
it
made
me
feel
more
like
pitching
i
seldom
talk
to
a
coacher
but
i
turned
to
griffith
and
said
i
bring
mike
up
and
we
see
what
he
can
do
i
deliberately
passed
hoblitzell
without
even
giving
him
a
chance
to
hit
at
a
single
ball
it
was
to
make
a
grand
stand
play
i
did
this
but
because
it
was
baseball
one
run
would
win
the
game
anyway
and
with
more
men
on
the
bases
there
were
more
plays
possible
besides
hoblitzell
is
a
nasty
hitter
and
i
thought
that
i
had
a
better
chance
of
making
mitchell
hit
the
ball
on
the
ground
a
desirable
thing
under
the
conditions
now
mike
urged
griffith
as
mitchell
stepped
up
to
the
plate
go
as
far
as
you
like
blot
up
the
bases
old
boy
this
blond
is
gone
that
sort
of
talk
never
bothers
me
i
had
better
luck
with
mitchell
than
i
had
hoped
he
struck
out
the
next
batter
was
easy
and
the
giants
won
the
game
in
the
tenth
inning
according
to
the
newspaper
reports
i
won
or
games
before
cincinnati
beat
me
again
so
it
can
be
seen
that
joshing
in
pinches
is
not
effective
against
all
pitchers
a
manager
must
judge
the
temperament
of
his
victim
but
griffith
has
never
stopped
trying
to
rag
me
in
when
the
giants
were
west
on
their
final
trip
i
was
warming
up
in
cincinnati
before
a
game
and
he
was
batting
out
flies
near
me
he
would
talk
to
me
between
each
ball
he
hit
to
the
outfield
got
anything
matty
he
asked
guess
there
ai
many
games
left
in
you
you
getting
old
when
i
broke
into
the
national
league
the
brooklyn
club
had
as
bad
a
bunch
of
men
to
bother
a
pitcher
as
i
ever
faced
the
team
had
won
the
championship
in
and
naturally
they
were
all
pretty
chesty
when
i
first
began
to
play
in
this
crowd
kelly
jennings
keeler
and
hanlon
got
after
me
pretty
strong
but
i
seemed
to
get
pitching
nourishment
out
of
their
line
of
conversation
and
won
a
lot
of
games
at
last
so
i
have
been
told
hanlon
who
was
the
manager
said
to
his
conversational
ball
players
lay
off
that
mathewson
kid
leave
him
alone
he
likes
the
chatter
you
fellows
spill
out
there
they
did
not
bother
me
after
that
but
this
bunch
spoiled
many
a
promising
young
pitcher
speaking
of
sizing
up
the
temperament
of
batters
and
pitchers
in
a
pinch
few
persons
realize
that
it
was
a
little
bit
of
carelessly
placed
conversation
belonging
to
chief
bender
the
indian
pitcher
on
the
athletics
that
did
as
much
as
anything
to
give
the
giants
the
first
game
in
the
world
series
josh
devore
the
on
the
new
york
team
is
an
batter
but
he
is
a
bulldog
in
a
pinch
and
is
more
apt
to
make
a
hit
in
a
tight
place
than
when
the
bases
are
empty
and
he
is
quite
as
likely
to
strike
out
he
is
the
type
of
ball
player
who
can
not
be
rattled
with
chief
myers
on
second
base
the
score
tied
and
two
out
devore
came
to
the
bat
in
the
seventh
inning
of
the
first
game
look
at
little
said
bender
who
had
been
talking
to
batters
all
through
the
game
devore
promptly
got
himself
into
the
hole
with
two
strikes
and
two
balls
on
him
but
a
little
drawback
like
that
never
worries
josh
i
going
to
pitch
you
a
curved
ball
over
the
outside
corner
shouted
bender
as
he
wound
up
i
know
it
chief
replied
josh
and
he
set
himself
to
receive
just
that
sort
of
delivery
up
came
the
predicted
curve
over
the
outside
corner
josh
hit
it
to
left
field
for
two
bases
and
brought
home
the
winning
run
bender
evidently
thought
that
by
telling
devore
what
he
was
actually
going
to
pitch
he
would
make
him
think
he
was
going
to
cross
him
i
knew
it
would
be
a
curve
ball
devore
told
me
after
the
game
with
two
and
two
he
would
be
crazy
to
hand
me
anything
else
when
he
made
that
crack
i
guessed
that
he
was
trying
to
cross
me
by
telling
the
truth
before
he
spoke
i
was
sure
which
corner
he
was
going
to
put
it
over
but
he
tipped
me
some
batters
might
have
been
fooled
by
those
tactics
it
was
taking
a
chance
in
a
pinch
and
bender
lost
very
few
of
the
fans
who
saw
this
first
game
of
the
world
series
realize
that
the
break
in
that
contest
came
in
the
fifth
inning
the
score
was
tied
with
runners
on
second
and
third
bases
with
two
out
when
eddie
collins
the
fast
second
baseman
of
the
athletics
and
a
dangerous
hitter
came
to
the
bat
i
realized
that
i
was
skating
on
thin
ice
and
was
putting
everything
i
had
on
the
ball
collins
hit
a
slow
one
down
the
first
base
line
about
six
feet
inside
the
bag
with
the
hit
i
ran
over
to
cover
the
base
and
merkle
made
for
the
ball
but
he
had
to
get
directly
in
my
line
of
approach
to
field
it
collins
steaming
down
the
base
line
realized
that
if
he
could
get
the
decision
at
first
on
this
hit
his
team
would
probably
win
the
game
as
the
two
other
runners
could
score
easily
in
a
flash
i
was
aware
of
this
too
i
take
it
yelled
merkle
as
he
stopped
to
pick
up
the
ball
seeing
merkle
and
me
in
front
of
him
both
heavy
men
collins
knew
that
he
could
not
get
past
us
standing
up
when
still
ten
or
twelve
feet
from
the
bag
he
slid
hoping
to
take
us
unawares
and
thus
avoid
being
touched
he
could
then
scramble
to
the
bag
as
soon
as
he
jumped
i
realized
what
he
hoped
to
do
and
fearing
that
merkle
would
miss
him
i
grabbed
the
first
baseman
and
hurled
him
at
collins
it
was
an
football
shove
merkle
landing
on
collins
and
touching
him
out
a
great
many
of
the
spectators
believed
that
i
had
interfered
with
merkle
on
the
play
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
thought
that
it
was
the
crisis
of
the
game
and
knew
that
if
collins
was
not
put
out
we
would
probably
lose
that
football
shove
was
a
brand
new
play
to
me
in
baseball
invented
on
the
spur
of
the
second
but
it
worked
in
minor
leagues
there
are
fewer
games
in
which
a
break
comes
it
does
not
develop
in
all
big
league
contests
by
any
means
sometimes
one
team
starts
to
win
in
the
first
inning
and
simply
runs
away
from
the
other
club
all
the
way
but
in
all
close
games
the
pinch
shows
up
it
happens
in
many
contests
in
the
major
leagues
because
of
the
almost
perfect
baseball
played
depending
on
his
fielders
a
manager
can
play
for
this
break
and
when
the
pinch
comes
it
is
a
case
of
the
batter
nerve
against
the
pitcher
iv
big
league
pitchers
and
their
peculiarities
every
pitcher
in
the
big
leagues
has
some
temperamental
or
mechanical
flaw
which
he
is
constantly
trying
to
hide
and
which
opposing
batters
are
always
endeavoring
to
uncover
the
giants
drove
coveleski
the
man
who
beat
them
out
of
a
pennant
back
to
the
minor
leagues
by
taunting
him
on
one
sore
point
weaknesses
of
other
like
great
artists
in
other
fields
of
endeavor
many
big
league
pitchers
are
temperamental
bugs
raymond
rube
waddell
slim
sallee
and
wild
bill
donovan
are
ready
examples
of
the
temperamental
type
the
first
three
are
the
sort
of
men
of
whom
the
manager
is
never
sure
he
does
not
know
when
they
come
into
the
ball
park
whether
or
not
they
are
in
condition
to
work
they
always
carry
with
them
a
delightful
atmosphere
of
uncertainty
in
contrast
to
this
eccentric
group
there
are
those
with
certain
mechanical
defects
in
their
pitching
of
which
opposing
clubs
take
advantage
last
comes
the
irritable
nervous
box
artist
who
must
have
things
just
so
even
down
to
the
temperature
before
he
can
work
satisfactorily
as
delicate
as
prima
donnas
says
john
mcgraw
of
this
variety
he
speaks
of
the
man
who
loses
his
love
for
his
art
when
his
shirt
is
too
tight
or
a
toe
is
sore
this
style
perhaps
is
the
most
difficult
for
a
manager
to
handle
unless
it
is
the
uncertain
eccentric
sort
as
soon
as
a
new
pitcher
breaks
into
the
big
leagues
seven
clubs
are
studying
him
with
microscopic
care
to
discover
some
flaw
in
his
physical
style
or
a
temperamental
weakness
on
which
his
opponents
can
play
naturally
if
the
man
has
such
a
groove
his
team
mates
are
endeavoring
to
hide
it
but
it
soon
leaks
out
and
becomes
general
gossip
around
the
circuit
then
the
seven
clubs
start
aiming
at
this
flaw
and
oftentimes
the
result
is
that
a
promising
young
pitcher
because
he
has
some
one
definite
weakness
goes
back
to
the
minors
a
crack
in
the
temperament
is
the
worst
mechanical
defects
can
usually
be
remedied
when
discovered
few
baseball
fans
know
that
the
giants
drove
a
man
back
to
the
minor
leagues
who
once
pitched
them
out
of
a
pennant
the
club
was
tipped
off
to
a
certain
unfortunate
circumstance
in
the
twirler
early
life
which
left
a
lasting
impression
on
his
mind
the
players
never
let
him
forget
this
when
he
was
in
a
game
and
it
was
like
constantly
hitting
him
on
a
boil
coveleski
won
three
games
for
the
philadelphia
national
league
club
from
the
giants
back
in
when
one
of
these
contests
would
have
meant
a
pennant
to
the
new
york
club
and
possibly
a
world
championship
that
was
the
season
the
fight
was
decided
in
a
single
game
with
the
chicago
cubs
after
the
regular
schedule
had
been
played
out
coveleski
was
hailed
as
a
wonder
for
his
performance
just
after
the
season
closed
tacks
ashenbach
the
scout
for
the
cincinnati
club
now
dead
and
formerly
a
manager
in
the
league
where
coveleski
got
his
start
came
to
mcgraw
and
laughed
behind
his
hand
mac
he
said
i
surprised
you
let
that
big
pole
beat
you
out
of
a
championship
i
can
give
you
the
prescription
to
use
every
time
that
he
starts
working
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
imitate
a
snare
drum
what
are
you
trying
to
do
kid
me
asked
mcgraw
for
he
was
still
tolerably
irritable
over
the
outcome
of
the
season
try
it
was
ashenbach
laconic
reply
the
result
was
that
the
first
game
coveleski
started
against
the
giants
the
next
season
there
was
a
chorus
of
from
the
bench
with
each
of
the
coachers
doing
a
solo
for
we
decided
after
due
consideration
this
was
the
way
to
imitate
a
snare
drum
we
would
have
tried
to
imitate
a
calliope
if
we
had
thought
that
it
would
have
done
any
good
against
this
pitcher
i
hire
a
fife
and
drum
corps
if
the
tip
is
worth
anything
declared
mcgraw
came
the
chorus
as
coveleski
wound
up
to
pitch
the
first
ball
it
went
wide
of
the
plate
it
was
repeated
all
through
the
inning
when
coveleski
walked
to
the
philadelphia
bench
at
the
end
of
the
first
round
after
the
giants
had
made
three
runs
off
him
he
looked
over
at
us
and
shouted
you
think
you
smart
do
you
was
the
only
reply
but
now
we
knew
we
had
him
when
a
pitcher
starts
to
talk
back
it
is
a
cinch
that
he
is
irritated
so
the
deadly
chorus
was
kept
up
in
volleys
until
the
umpire
stopped
us
and
then
it
had
to
be
in
a
broken
fire
but
always
there
was
the
when
coveleski
looked
at
mcgraw
coaching
on
third
base
the
manager
made
as
if
to
beat
a
snare
drum
and
as
he
glanced
at
latham
stationed
at
first
arlie
would
reply
with
the
the
team
on
the
bench
sounded
like
a
fife
and
drum
corps
without
the
fifes
and
coveleski
got
no
peace
in
the
fourth
inning
after
the
game
had
been
hopelessly
lost
by
the
philadelphia
club
coveleski
was
taken
out
we
did
not
understand
the
reason
for
it
but
we
all
knew
that
we
had
found
coveleski
groove
with
that
chorus
the
man
who
had
beaten
the
new
york
club
out
of
a
pennant
never
won
another
game
against
the
giants
say
said
mcgraw
to
tacks
ashenbach
the
next
time
the
club
was
in
cincinnati
there
are
two
things
i
want
to
ask
you
first
why
does
that
thing
get
under
coveleski
skin
so
badly
and
second
why
did
you
mention
it
to
us
when
he
was
beating
the
club
out
of
a
championship
last
fall
never
thought
of
it
asserted
ashenbach
just
chanced
to
be
telling
stories
one
day
last
winter
about
the
old
times
in
the
when
that
weakness
of
coveleski
happened
to
pop
into
my
mind
thought
maybe
he
was
cured
cured
echoed
mcgraw
only
way
he
could
be
cured
of
that
is
to
poison
him
but
tip
me
why
is
it
well
this
is
the
way
i
heard
it
answered
ashenbach
when
he
was
a
coal
miner
back
in
shamokin
pennsylvania
he
got
stuck
on
some
jane
who
was
very
fond
of
music
everybody
who
was
any
one
played
in
the
silver
cornet
band
down
in
melodeon
hall
on
thursday
nights
the
girl
told
coveleski
that
she
could
see
him
with
an
unless
he
broke
into
the
band
i
ca
play
any
instrument
said
the
pole
get
busy
and
learn
and
do
show
around
here
until
you
have
answered
the
girl
now
coveleski
had
no
talent
for
music
so
he
picked
out
the
snare
drum
as
his
victim
and
started
practising
regularly
getting
some
instruction
from
the
local
bandmaster
after
he
had
driven
all
the
neighbors
pretty
nearly
crazy
the
bandmaster
said
he
would
give
him
a
show
at
the
big
annual
concert
when
he
tried
to
get
all
the
pieces
in
his
outfit
that
he
could
things
went
all
right
until
it
was
time
for
coveleski
to
come
along
with
a
little
bit
on
the
snare
drum
and
then
he
was
nowhere
in
the
neighborhood
he
did
even
swing
at
it
but
later
when
the
leader
waved
for
a
solo
from
the
fiddle
coveleski
mistook
it
for
his
sign
and
came
in
so
strong
on
the
snare
drum
that
no
one
could
identify
the
fiddle
in
the
mixup
the
result
was
that
the
leader
asked
for
waivers
on
old
coveleski
very
promptly
and
the
girl
was
not
long
in
following
suit
that
snare
drum
incident
has
been
the
sore
point
in
his
makeup
ever
since
i
wish
i
known
it
last
fall
about
the
first
of
september
declared
mcgraw
but
the
real
snapper
came
later
when
the
cincinnati
club
was
whipsawed
on
the
information
in
a
trade
with
philadelphia
griffith
got
coveleski
for
cincinnati
along
with
several
other
players
each
game
he
started
against
us
he
got
the
old
griffith
protested
to
the
umpires
but
it
is
impossible
to
stop
a
thing
of
that
sort
even
though
the
judges
of
play
did
try
the
pole
did
not
finish
another
game
against
the
giants
until
his
last
in
the
big
league
one
day
we
were
hitting
him
near
and
far
and
the
chorus
was
only
interrupted
by
the
rattle
of
the
bats
against
the
ball
when
he
looked
in
at
the
bench
to
see
if
griffith
wanted
to
take
him
out
for
it
was
about
his
usual
leaving
time
stay
in
there
and
get
it
shouted
back
griff
coveleski
did
he
absorbed
nineteen
hits
and
seventeen
runs
at
the
hands
of
the
giants
this
man
who
had
taken
a
championship
of
the
national
league
away
from
us
that
night
griffith
asked
for
waivers
on
him
and
he
left
the
big
leagues
for
good
he
was
a
good
twirler
except
for
that
one
flaw
which
cost
him
his
place
in
the
big
show
there
is
little
mercy
among
professional
ball
players
when
a
game
is
at
stake
especially
if
the
man
has
taken
a
championship
away
from
a
team
by
insisting
upon
working
out
of
his
turn
so
he
can
win
games
that
will
benefit
his
club
not
a
scintilla
mordecai
brown
the
great
pitcher
of
the
chicago
cubs
and
the
man
who
did
more
than
any
other
one
player
to
bring
four
national
league
pennants
and
two
world
championships
to
that
club
has
a
physical
deformity
which
has
turned
out
to
be
an
advantage
many
years
ago
brown
lost
most
of
the
first
finger
of
his
right
hand
in
an
argument
with
a
feed
cutter
said
finger
being
amputated
at
the
second
joint
while
his
third
finger
is
shorter
than
it
should
be
because
a
hot
grounder
carried
part
of
it
away
one
day
in
some
strange
way
brown
has
achieved
wonders
with
this
crippled
hand
it
is
on
account
of
the
missing
finger
that
he
is
called
three
fingered
brown
and
he
is
better
known
by
that
appellation
than
by
his
real
name
brown
beat
the
giants
a
hard
game
one
day
in
pitching
against
me
he
had
a
big
curve
lots
of
speed
and
absolute
control
the
giants
could
not
touch
him
next
day
mcgraw
was
out
warming
up
with
arthur
wilson
the
young
catcher
on
the
club
wonder
if
he
gets
any
new
curve
with
that
short
first
finger
said
mcgraw
and
thereupon
crooked
his
own
initial
digit
and
began
trying
to
throw
the
ball
in
different
ways
off
it
to
see
what
the
result
would
be
finally
he
decided
no
i
guess
he
does
get
anything
extra
with
the
abbreviated
finger
but
that
lucky
for
you
fellows
because
if
i
thought
he
did
i
have
a
surgeon
out
here
operating
on
the
first
fingers
of
each
of
you
pitchers
brown
is
my
idea
of
the
almost
perfect
pitcher
he
is
always
ready
to
work
it
is
customary
for
most
managers
in
the
big
leagues
to
say
to
a
man
on
the
day
he
is
slated
to
pitch
well
how
do
you
feel
want
to
work
then
if
the
twirler
is
not
right
he
has
a
chance
to
say
so
but
brown
always
replies
yes
i
ready
he
likes
to
pitch
and
is
in
chronic
condition
it
will
usually
be
found
at
the
end
of
a
season
that
he
has
taken
part
in
more
games
than
any
other
pitcher
in
the
country
he
held
the
chicago
pitching
staff
together
in
three
fingered
brown
is
a
finished
pitcher
in
all
departments
of
the
game
besides
being
a
great
worker
he
is
a
wonderful
fielder
and
sure
death
on
bunts
he
spends
weeks
in
the
spring
preparing
himself
to
field
short
hits
in
the
infield
and
it
is
fatal
to
try
to
bunt
against
him
he
has
perfected
and
used
successfully
for
three
years
a
play
invented
by
joe
mcginnity
the
former
giant
pitcher
this
play
is
with
men
on
first
and
second
bases
and
no
one
out
or
one
out
the
batter
tries
to
sacrifice
but
instead
of
fielding
the
ball
to
first
base
which
would
advance
the
two
base
runners
as
intended
brown
makes
the
play
to
third
and
thus
forces
out
the
man
nearest
the
plate
this
is
usually
successful
unless
the
bunt
is
laid
down
perfectly
along
the
first
base
line
so
that
the
ball
can
not
be
thrown
to
third
base
the
cubs
have
always
claimed
it
was
this
play
which
broke
the
detroit
club
heart
in
the
world
series
in
and
turned
the
tide
so
that
the
cubs
took
the
championship
the
american
league
team
was
leading
in
the
first
game
and
runners
were
on
first
and
second
bases
ty
cobb
being
on
the
middle
sack
it
was
evident
that
the
batter
would
try
to
sacrifice
brown
walked
over
to
steinfeldt
playing
third
base
pulling
out
a
chew
of
tobacco
as
he
went
no
matter
what
this
guy
does
or
where
he
hits
it
stick
to
your
bag
ordered
brown
then
he
put
the
chew
of
tobacco
in
his
mouth
a
sign
which
augurs
ill
for
his
opponents
and
pitched
a
low
one
to
the
batter
a
perfect
ball
to
bunt
he
followed
the
pitch
through
and
was
on
top
of
the
plate
as
the
batter
laid
it
down
the
ball
rolled
slowly
down
the
third
base
line
until
brown
pounced
on
it
he
whirled
and
drove
the
ball
at
steinfeldt
getting
cobb
by
a
foot
that
play
carried
detroit
off
its
feet
as
a
sudden
reversal
often
will
a
ball
club
when
things
are
apparently
breaking
for
it
cobb
the
tigers
speed
flash
had
been
caught
at
third
base
on
an
attempted
sacrifice
an
unheard
of
play
and
from
that
point
on
the
american
leaguers
wilted
according
to
the
stories
of
chance
and
his
men
it
is
brown
perfect
control
that
has
permitted
catchers
like
kling
and
archer
to
make
such
great
records
as
throwers
this
pitcher
can
afford
to
waste
a
ball
that
is
pitch
out
so
the
batter
can
not
hit
it
but
putting
the
catcher
in
a
perfect
position
to
throw
and
then
he
knows
he
can
get
the
next
one
over
a
catcher
efficiency
as
a
thrower
depends
largely
on
the
pitcher
ability
to
have
good
enough
control
of
the
ball
to
be
able
to
pitch
out
when
it
is
necessary
brown
helps
a
catcher
by
the
way
in
which
he
watches
the
bases
not
permitting
the
runners
to
take
any
lead
on
him
all
around
i
think
that
he
is
one
of
the
most
finished
pitchers
of
the
game
russell
ford
of
the
new
york
american
league
club
has
a
hard
pitching
motion
because
he
seems
to
throw
a
spit
ball
with
a
jerk
he
can
not
pitch
more
than
one
good
game
in
four
or
five
days
mcgraw
had
detected
this
weakness
from
watching
the
highlanders
play
before
the
series
in
and
took
advantage
of
it
if
ford
pitches
said
mcgraw
to
his
team
in
the
clubhouse
before
the
first
game
wait
everything
out
to
the
last
minute
make
him
pitch
every
ball
you
can
mcgraw
knew
that
the
strain
on
ford
arm
would
get
him
along
toward
the
end
of
the
game
in
the
eighth
inning
the
score
was
tied
when
devore
came
to
the
bat
no
crack
in
ford
was
perceptible
to
the
rest
of
us
but
mcgraw
must
have
detected
some
slight
sign
of
weakening
he
stopped
josh
on
the
way
to
the
plate
and
ordered
now
go
ahead
and
get
him
by
the
time
the
inning
was
over
the
giants
had
made
four
runs
and
eventually
won
the
game
by
the
score
of
to
mcgraw
just
played
for
this
flaw
in
ford
pitching
and
hung
his
whole
plan
of
battle
on
the
chance
of
it
showing
old
cy
young
has
the
absolutely
perfect
pitching
motion
when
he
jumped
from
the
national
league
to
the
boston
american
league
club
some
years
ago
during
the
war
times
many
national
league
players
thought
that
he
was
through
what
said
fred
clarke
the
manager
of
the
pittsburg
club
you
american
leaguers
letting
that
old
boy
make
good
in
your
set
why
he
was
done
when
he
jumped
the
national
he
lost
his
speed
but
you
ought
to
see
his
curve
ball
answered
bill
dineen
then
pitching
for
the
boston
americans
curve
ball
echoed
clarke
he
never
had
any
curve
that
it
did
take
a
microscope
to
find
he
depended
on
his
speed
well
he
got
one
now
replied
dineen
clarke
had
a
chance
to
look
at
the
curve
ball
later
for
with
dineen
young
did
a
lot
toward
winning
the
world
championship
for
boston
from
pittsburg
in
the
old
pitcher
was
wise
enough
to
realize
when
he
began
to
lose
his
speed
that
he
would
have
to
develop
a
curve
ball
or
go
back
to
the
minors
and
he
set
to
work
and
produced
a
peach
he
is
still
pitching
for
the
national
league
now
and
he
will
win
a
lot
of
games
yet
when
he
came
back
in
the
american
leaguers
said
what
going
to
let
that
old
man
in
your
show
again
he
done
maybe
he
will
yet
figure
in
another
world
championship
one
never
can
tell
anyway
he
has
taken
a
couple
of
falls
out
of
pittsburg
just
for
good
luck
since
he
came
back
to
the
national
league
some
pitchers
depend
largely
on
their
motions
to
fool
batters
motion
pitchers
they
might
be
called
such
an
elaborate
is
developed
that
it
is
hard
for
a
hitter
to
tell
when
and
from
where
the
ball
is
coming
slim
sallee
of
the
louis
nationals
has
any
curve
to
mention
and
he
lacks
speed
but
he
wins
a
lot
of
ball
games
on
his
motion
it
a
crime
says
mcgraw
to
let
a
fellow
like
that
beat
you
why
he
has
so
little
on
the
ball
that
it
looks
like
one
of
those
salome
dancers
when
it
comes
up
to
the
plate
and
actually
makes
me
blush
but
sallee
will
take
a
long
and
shoot
one
off
his
shoe
tops
and
another
from
his
shoulder
while
he
is
facing
second
base
he
has
good
control
has
catalogued
the
weaknesses
of
the
batters
and
can
work
the
corners
with
this
capital
he
was
winning
ball
games
for
the
cardinals
in
until
he
fell
off
the
water
wagon
he
is
different
from
raymond
in
that
respect
when
he
is
on
the
vehicle
he
is
on
it
and
when
he
is
off
he
is
distinctly
a
pedestrian
the
way
the
giants
try
to
beat
sallee
is
to
get
men
on
the
bases
because
then
he
has
to
cut
down
his
motion
or
they
will
run
wild
on
him
as
soon
as
a
runner
gets
on
the
bag
with
sallee
pitching
he
tries
to
steal
to
make
slim
reduce
that
long
winding
motion
which
is
his
greatest
asset
but
sallee
won
several
games
from
the
giants
last
season
because
we
could
not
get
enough
men
on
the
bases
to
beat
him
he
only
gave
us
four
or
five
hits
per
contest
for
a
long
time
josh
devore
the
giants
was
plate
shy
with
that
is
he
stepped
away
and
all
the
pitchers
in
the
league
soon
learned
of
this
and
started
shooting
the
first
ball
a
fast
one
at
his
head
to
increase
his
natural
timidity
sallee
in
particular
had
him
scared
stand
up
there
said
mcgraw
to
josh
one
day
when
sallee
was
pitching
and
let
him
hit
you
he
has
speed
enough
to
hurt
you
josh
did
got
hit
and
found
out
that
what
mcgraw
said
was
true
it
cured
him
of
being
afraid
of
sallee
as
getting
men
on
the
bases
decreases
sallee
effectiveness
even
if
he
is
a
so
it
increases
the
efficiency
of
lefty
leifield
of
pittsburg
the
giants
never
regard
sallee
as
a
with
men
on
the
bases
most
southpaws
can
keep
a
runner
close
to
the
bag
because
they
are
facing
first
base
when
in
a
position
to
pitch
but
sallee
can
not
on
the
other
hand
leifield
uses
almost
exactly
the
same
motion
to
throw
to
first
base
as
to
pitch
to
the
batter
these
two
are
so
nearly
alike
that
he
can
change
his
mind
after
he
starts
and
throw
to
the
other
place
he
keeps
men
hugging
the
bag
and
it
is
next
to
impossible
to
steal
bases
on
him
if
he
gets
his
arm
so
far
forward
in
pitching
to
the
batter
that
he
can
not
throw
to
the
base
he
can
see
a
man
start
and
pitch
out
so
the
catcher
has
a
fine
chance
to
get
the
runner
at
second
if
the
signal
is
for
a
curved
ball
he
can
make
it
a
high
curve
and
the
catcher
is
in
position
to
throw
leifield
has
been
working
this
combination
pitch
either
to
first
base
or
the
plate
for
years
and
the
motion
for
each
is
so
similar
that
even
the
umpires
can
not
detect
it
and
never
call
a
balk
on
him
a
busher
broke
into
the
league
with
the
giants
one
fall
and
was
batting
against
pittsburg
there
was
a
man
on
first
base
and
leifield
started
to
pitch
to
the
plate
saw
by
a
quick
glance
that
the
runner
was
taking
too
large
a
lead
and
threw
to
first
the
youngster
swung
at
the
ball
and
started
to
run
it
out
every
one
laughed
what
were
you
trying
to
do
asked
mcgraw
i
hit
the
ball
protested
the
bush
leaguer
that
is
how
perfect
leifield
motion
is
with
men
on
the
bases
but
most
of
his
effectiveness
resides
in
that
crafty
motion
many
new
york
fans
will
remember
dummy
taylor
the
deaf
and
dumb
pitcher
of
the
giants
he
won
ball
games
for
the
last
two
years
he
was
with
the
club
on
his
peculiar
whirling
motion
but
as
soon
as
men
got
on
the
bases
and
he
had
to
cut
it
down
mcgraw
would
take
him
out
that
swing
and
his
irresistible
good
nature
are
still
winning
games
in
the
international
league
which
used
to
be
the
eastern
so
if
a
pitcher
expects
to
be
a
successful
big
leaguer
he
must
guard
against
eccentricities
of
temperament
and
mechanical
motion
as
i
have
said
drucke
of
the
giants
for
a
long
time
had
a
little
movement
with
his
foot
which
indicated
to
the
runner
when
he
was
going
to
pitch
and
they
stole
bases
wildly
on
him
but
mcgraw
soon
discovered
that
something
was
wrong
and
corrected
it
the
armor
of
a
big
leaguer
must
be
impenetrable
for
there
are
seven
clubs
always
looking
for
flaws
in
the
manufacture
and
every
little
movement
has
a
meaning
of
its
own
v
playing
the
game
from
the
bench
every
big
league
ball
game
there
is
a
master
mind
which
directs
the
moves
of
the
players
how
mcgraw
won
two
pennants
for
the
giants
from
the
bench
and
lost
one
by
giving
the
players
too
much
liberty
the
methods
of
connie
mack
and
other
great
the
bench
to
many
fans
who
see
a
hundred
big
league
ball
games
each
season
this
is
a
long
hooded
structure
from
which
the
next
batter
emerges
and
where
the
players
sit
while
their
club
is
at
bat
it
is
also
the
resort
of
the
substitutes
manager
mascot
and
water
cooler
but
to
the
ball
player
it
is
the
headquarters
it
is
the
place
from
which
the
orders
come
and
it
is
here
that
the
battle
is
planned
and
from
here
the
moves
are
executed
the
manager
sits
here
and
pulls
the
wires
and
his
players
obey
him
as
if
they
were
manikins
the
batteries
for
game
says
the
umpire
will
be
sallee
and
bresnahan
for
louis
wiltse
and
meyers
for
new
york
bunt
says
mcgraw
as
his
players
scatter
to
take
their
positions
on
the
field
he
repeats
the
order
when
they
come
to
the
bat
for
the
first
inning
because
he
knows
that
sallee
has
two
weaknesses
one
being
that
he
can
not
field
bunts
and
the
other
that
a
great
deal
of
activity
in
the
box
tires
him
out
so
that
he
weakens
a
bunting
game
hits
at
both
these
flaws
as
soon
as
bresnahan
observes
the
plan
of
battle
he
arranges
his
players
to
meet
the
attack
draws
in
his
third
baseman
shifts
the
shortstop
more
down
the
line
toward
third
base
and
is
on
the
alert
himself
to
gather
in
slow
rollers
just
in
front
of
the
plate
the
idea
is
to
give
sallee
the
minimum
opportunity
to
get
at
the
ball
and
reduce
his
fielding
responsibilities
to
nothing
or
less
there
is
one
thing
about
style
known
to
every
big
league
manager
he
is
not
half
as
effective
with
men
on
the
bases
for
he
depends
largely
on
his
deceptive
motion
to
fool
the
batters
and
when
he
has
to
cut
this
down
because
runners
are
on
the
bases
his
pitching
ability
evaporates
after
the
old
polo
grounds
had
been
burned
down
in
the
spring
of
we
were
playing
louis
at
american
league
park
one
saturday
afternoon
and
the
final
returns
of
the
game
were
about
to
in
our
favor
as
near
as
i
can
remember
we
made
thirteen
runs
in
the
first
inning
many
spectators
went
away
from
the
park
talking
about
a
slaughter
and
a
runaway
score
and
so
on
that
game
was
won
in
the
very
first
inning
when
sallee
went
into
the
box
to
pitch
and
mcgraw
had
murmured
that
mystic
word
bunt
the
first
batters
bunted
bunted
bunted
in
monotonous
succession
sallee
not
yet
in
very
good
physical
condition
because
it
was
early
in
the
season
was
stood
upon
his
head
by
this
form
of
attack
bresnahan
redraped
his
infield
to
try
to
stop
this
onslaught
and
then
mcgraw
switched
hit
it
he
directed
the
next
batter
a
line
drive
whistled
past
mowrey
ears
the
man
who
plays
third
base
on
the
cardinals
he
was
coming
in
to
get
a
bunt
another
followed
the
break
had
come
bresnahan
removed
sallee
and
put
another
pitcher
into
the
box
but
once
a
ball
club
starts
to
hit
the
ball
it
is
like
a
skidding
automobile
it
ca
be
stopped
the
giants
kept
on
and
piled
up
a
ridiculous
and
laughable
score
which
mcgraw
had
made
possible
in
the
first
inning
by
directing
his
men
to
bunt
the
giants
won
the
championship
of
the
national
league
in
and
the
new
york
fans
gave
the
team
credit
for
the
victory
it
was
a
club
of
young
players
and
mcgraw
realized
this
fact
when
he
started
his
campaign
every
play
that
season
was
made
from
the
bench
made
by
john
mcgraw
through
his
agents
his
manikins
who
moved
according
to
the
wires
which
he
pulled
and
by
the
end
of
the
summer
his
hands
were
badly
calloused
from
pulling
wires
but
the
giants
had
the
pennant
when
the
batter
was
at
the
plate
in
a
critical
stage
he
would
stall
and
look
to
the
bench
for
orders
to
discover
whether
to
hit
the
ball
out
or
lay
it
down
whether
to
try
the
hit
and
run
or
wait
for
the
base
runner
to
attempt
to
steal
by
stalling
i
mean
that
he
would
tie
his
shoe
or
fix
his
belt
or
find
any
little
excuse
to
delay
the
game
so
that
he
could
get
a
flash
at
the
bench
for
orders
a
shoe
lace
has
played
an
important
role
in
many
a
big
league
battle
as
i
will
try
to
show
later
on
in
this
story
if
it
ever
became
the
custom
to
wear
button
shoes
the
game
would
have
to
be
revised
as
the
batter
looked
toward
the
bench
mcgraw
might
reach
for
his
handkerchief
to
blow
his
nose
and
the
batter
knew
it
was
up
to
him
to
hit
the
ball
out
some
days
in
that
season
of
i
saw
mcgraw
blow
his
nose
during
a
game
until
it
was
red
and
sore
on
the
end
and
then
another
day
when
he
had
a
cold
in
his
head
he
had
to
do
without
his
handkerchief
because
he
wanted
to
play
a
bunting
game
until
his
cold
got
better
he
had
to
switch
to
another
system
of
signs
during
that
season
each
coacher
would
keep
his
eye
on
the
bench
for
orders
around
mcgraw
revolved
the
game
of
the
giants
he
was
the
game
and
most
of
that
summer
he
spent
upon
the
bench
because
from
there
he
could
get
the
best
look
at
the
diamond
and
his
observations
were
not
confined
to
one
place
or
to
one
base
runner
he
was
able
to
discover
whether
an
was
playing
too
close
for
a
batter
or
too
far
out
and
rearrange
the
men
he
could
perhaps
catch
a
sign
from
the
opposing
catcher
and
pass
it
along
to
the
batter
and
he
won
the
pennant
from
the
bench
he
was
seldom
seen
on
the
coaching
lines
that
year
many
fans
wonder
why
when
the
giants
get
behind
in
a
game
mcgraw
takes
to
the
bench
after
having
been
out
on
the
coaching
lines
inning
after
inning
while
the
club
was
holding
its
own
or
winning
time
and
again
i
have
heard
him
criticised
for
this
by
spectators
and
even
by
players
on
other
clubs
mcgraw
is
players
have
said
to
me
just
as
soon
as
his
club
gets
behind
he
runs
for
cover
the
crime
of
being
yellow
is
the
worst
in
the
big
leagues
it
means
that
a
man
is
afraid
that
he
lacks
the
nerve
to
face
the
music
but
mcgraw
and
yellow
are
as
far
apart
as
the
poles
or
alpha
and
omega
or
fifth
avenue
and
the
bowery
or
any
two
widely
separated
and
distant
things
i
have
seen
mcgraw
go
on
to
ball
fields
where
he
is
as
welcome
as
a
man
with
the
black
smallpox
and
face
the
crowd
alone
that
in
the
heat
of
its
excitement
would
like
to
tear
him
apart
i
have
seen
him
take
all
sorts
of
personal
chances
he
does
know
what
fear
is
and
in
his
bright
lexicon
of
baseball
there
is
no
such
word
as
fear
his
success
is
partly
due
to
his
indomitable
courage
there
is
a
real
reason
for
his
going
to
the
bench
when
the
team
gets
behind
it
is
because
this
increases
the
club
chances
of
winning
from
the
bench
he
can
see
the
whole
field
can
note
where
his
fielders
are
playing
can
get
a
peek
at
the
other
bench
and
perhaps
pick
up
a
tip
as
to
what
to
expect
he
can
watch
his
own
pitcher
or
observe
whether
the
opposing
twirler
drops
his
throwing
arm
as
if
weary
he
is
at
the
helm
when
on
the
bench
and
noting
any
flaw
in
the
opposition
he
is
in
a
position
to
take
advantage
of
it
at
a
moment
notice
or
catching
some
sign
of
faltering
among
his
own
men
he
is
immediately
there
to
strengthen
the
weakness
many
a
game
he
has
pulled
out
of
the
fire
by
going
back
to
the
bench
and
watching
so
the
idea
obtained
by
many
spectators
that
he
is
quitting
is
the
wrong
one
he
is
only
fighting
harder
the
giants
were
playing
pittsburg
one
day
in
the
season
of
and
clarke
and
mcgraw
had
been
having
a
great
guessing
match
it
was
one
of
those
games
with
plenty
of
batting
with
one
club
forging
ahead
and
then
the
other
clarke
had
saved
the
game
for
pittsburg
in
the
sixth
inning
by
a
leifield
had
been
pitching
up
to
this
point
and
he
was
there
or
even
in
the
neighborhood
but
still
the
pirates
were
leading
by
two
runs
having
previously
knocked
ames
out
of
the
box
doyle
and
mccormick
made
hits
with
no
one
out
in
our
half
of
the
sixth
it
looked
like
the
break
and
mcgraw
was
urging
his
players
on
to
even
up
the
score
when
clarke
suddenly
took
off
his
sun
glasses
in
left
field
and
stooped
down
to
tie
his
shoe
when
he
removes
his
that
is
a
sign
for
a
pitcher
to
warm
up
in
a
hurry
and
babe
adams
sprinted
to
the
outfield
with
a
catcher
and
began
to
heat
up
clarke
took
all
of
five
minutes
to
tie
that
shoe
mcgraw
violently
protesting
against
the
delay
in
the
meantime
fred
clarke
has
been
known
to
wear
out
a
pair
of
shoe
laces
in
one
game
tying
and
untying
them
after
the
shoe
was
fixed
up
he
jogged
slowly
to
the
bench
and
took
leifield
out
of
the
box
in
the
interim
adams
had
had
an
opportunity
to
warm
up
and
clarke
raised
his
arm
and
ordered
him
into
the
box
he
fanned
the
next
two
men
and
the
last
batter
hit
an
easy
roller
to
wagner
we
were
still
two
runs
to
the
bad
after
that
promising
start
in
the
sixth
and
clarke
for
the
time
being
had
saved
the
game
by
a
shoe
string
mcgraw
who
had
been
on
the
coaching
lines
up
to
this
point
retired
to
the
bench
after
that
and
i
heard
one
of
those
wise
spectators
sitting
just
behind
our
coop
who
could
tell
rockefeller
how
to
run
his
business
but
who
spends
his
life
working
as
a
clerk
at
a
week
remark
to
a
friend
it
all
off
now
mcgraw
has
laid
down
watching
the
game
through
eyes
half
shut
and
drawn
to
a
focus
mcgraw
waited
in
the
seventh
inning
clarke
came
to
bat
with
two
men
on
the
bases
a
hit
would
have
won
the
game
beyond
any
doubt
in
a
flash
mcgraw
was
on
his
feet
and
ran
out
to
meyers
catching
he
stopped
the
game
and
with
a
wave
of
his
arm
drew
harry
mccormick
playing
left
field
in
close
to
third
base
the
game
went
on
and
wiltse
twisted
a
slow
curve
over
the
outside
corner
of
the
plate
to
clarke
a
hitter
he
timed
his
swing
and
sent
a
low
hit
singing
over
third
base
mccormick
dashed
in
and
caught
the
ball
off
his
shoe
tops
that
made
three
outs
mcgraw
had
saved
our
chances
of
victory
right
there
for
had
mccormick
been
playing
where
he
originally
intended
before
mcgraw
stopped
the
contest
the
ball
would
have
landed
in
unguarded
territory
and
two
runs
would
have
been
scored
but
mcgraw
had
yet
the
game
to
win
as
his
team
came
to
the
bat
for
the
seventh
he
said
this
fellow
adams
is
a
youngster
and
liable
to
be
nervous
and
wild
wait
the
batters
waited
with
the
patience
of
job
each
man
let
the
first
two
balls
pass
him
and
made
adams
pitch
himself
to
the
limit
to
every
batter
it
got
on
adams
nerves
in
the
ninth
he
passed
a
couple
of
men
and
a
hit
tied
the
score
clarke
left
him
in
the
box
for
he
was
short
of
pitchers
on
the
game
went
to
ten
eleven
twelve
thirteen
innings
the
score
was
still
tied
and
wiltse
was
pitching
like
a
machine
mcgraw
was
on
the
bench
leaving
the
coaching
to
his
lieutenants
the
club
was
still
waiting
for
the
youngster
to
weaken
at
last
in
the
thirteenth
after
one
man
had
been
put
out
the
eye
of
mcgraw
saw
adams
drop
his
pitching
arm
to
his
side
as
if
tired
it
was
only
a
minute
motion
none
of
the
spectators
saw
it
none
of
the
players
now
hit
it
boys
came
the
order
from
the
bench
the
style
was
switched
and
the
game
won
when
three
hits
were
rattled
out
mcgraw
alone
observed
that
sign
of
weakening
and
took
advantage
of
it
at
the
opportune
time
he
won
the
game
from
the
bench
that
is
what
makes
him
a
great
manager
observing
the
little
things
anyone
can
see
the
big
ones
if
he
had
been
on
the
coaching
lines
he
would
not
have
had
as
good
an
opportunity
to
study
the
young
pitcher
for
he
would
have
had
to
devote
his
attention
to
the
base
runners
he
might
have
missed
this
sign
of
wilting
mcgraw
is
always
studying
a
pitcher
particularly
a
new
one
in
the
league
the
louis
club
had
a
young
pitcher
last
fall
named
laudermilk
who
was
being
tried
out
he
had
a
brother
on
the
team
in
his
first
game
against
the
giants
played
in
louis
he
held
us
to
a
few
scattered
hits
and
gave
us
a
terrific
battle
only
losing
the
game
because
one
of
his
fielders
made
a
costly
error
behind
him
the
papers
of
louis
boosted
him
as
another
rube
waddell
he
was
mcgraw
laughed
all
i
want
he
said
is
another
crack
at
that
buttermilk
after
what
i
learned
about
him
this
afternoon
he
ca
control
his
curve
and
all
you
fellows
have
got
to
do
is
wait
for
his
fast
one
he
gave
you
that
fight
because
he
had
you
all
swinging
at
bad
curve
balls
laudermilk
made
another
appearance
against
the
giants
later
and
he
made
his
disappearance
in
that
game
in
the
fourth
inning
when
only
one
was
out
to
be
exact
after
we
had
scored
five
runs
off
him
by
waiting
for
his
fast
one
according
to
mcgraw
orders
after
winning
the
pennant
in
by
sitting
on
the
bench
keeping
away
from
the
coaching
lines
and
making
every
play
himself
mcgraw
decided
that
his
men
were
older
and
knew
the
game
and
that
he
would
give
them
more
rein
in
he
appeared
oftener
on
the
coaching
lines
and
attended
more
to
the
base
runners
than
to
the
game
as
a
whole
but
in
the
crises
he
was
the
man
who
decided
what
was
to
be
done
the
club
won
the
pennant
that
year
and
the
world
championship
the
players
got
very
chesty
immediately
thereafter
and
the
buttons
on
their
vests
had
to
be
shifted
back
to
make
room
for
the
new
measure
they
knew
the
game
and
had
won
two
pennants
besides
a
championship
of
the
world
so
in
the
season
of
mcgraw
started
with
a
team
of
veterans
and
it
was
predicted
that
he
would
repeat
but
these
men
who
knew
the
game
were
making
decisions
for
themselves
because
mcgraw
was
giving
them
more
liberty
the
runners
went
wild
on
the
bases
and
tried
things
at
the
wrong
stages
they
lost
game
after
game
at
last
after
a
particularly
disastrous
defeat
one
day
mcgraw
called
his
men
together
in
the
clubhouse
and
addressed
them
in
this
wise
because
you
fellows
have
won
two
championships
and
beaten
the
athletics
is
no
reason
for
you
all
to
believe
that
you
are
fit
to
write
a
book
on
how
to
play
baseball
you
are
just
running
wild
on
the
bases
you
might
as
well
not
have
a
manager
now
do
any
one
try
to
pull
anything
without
orders
we
will
begin
all
over
again
but
it
is
hard
to
teach
old
new
tricks
and
several
fines
had
to
be
imposed
before
the
orders
were
obeyed
the
club
did
not
win
the
championship
that
year
when
mcgraw
won
the
pennant
in
he
did
it
with
a
club
of
youngsters
many
of
them
playing
through
their
first
whole
season
as
regulars
in
the
company
there
were
snodgrass
and
devore
and
fletcher
and
marquard
every
time
a
batter
went
to
the
plate
he
had
definite
orders
from
the
bench
as
to
what
he
was
to
attempt
whether
to
take
two
or
lay
the
ball
down
or
swing
or
work
the
hit
and
run
each
time
that
a
man
shot
out
from
first
base
like
a
catapulted
figure
and
slid
into
second
he
had
been
ordered
by
mcgraw
to
try
to
steal
if
players
protested
against
his
judgment
his
invariable
answer
was
do
what
i
tell
you
and
i
take
the
blame
for
mistakes
one
of
mcgraw
laments
is
i
wish
i
could
be
in
three
places
at
once
i
never
heard
him
say
it
with
such
a
ring
to
the
words
as
after
snodgrass
was
touched
out
in
the
third
game
of
the
world
series
in
the
tenth
inning
when
his
life
might
have
meant
victory
in
that
game
anyway
i
have
frequently
referred
to
the
incident
in
these
stories
so
most
of
my
readers
are
familiar
with
the
situation
snodgrass
was
put
out
trying
to
get
to
third
base
on
a
short
passed
ball
after
he
had
started
back
for
second
to
recover
some
of
the
ground
he
had
taken
in
too
long
a
lead
before
the
ball
got
to
lapp
mcgraw
face
took
on
an
expression
of
agony
as
if
he
were
watching
his
dearest
friend
die
if
i
could
only
have
been
there
he
said
i
wish
i
could
be
in
three
places
at
once
he
meant
the
bench
the
first
base
coaching
line
and
the
third
base
line
at
this
particular
time
he
was
giving
the
batters
orders
from
the
bench
it
was
one
of
those
incidents
which
come
up
in
a
ball
game
and
have
to
be
decided
in
the
drawing
of
a
breath
so
that
a
manager
can
not
give
orders
unless
he
is
right
on
the
spot
it
is
my
opinion
that
it
is
a
big
advantage
to
a
team
to
have
the
manager
on
the
bench
rather
than
in
the
game
frank
chance
of
the
chicago
cubs
is
a
great
leader
but
i
think
he
would
be
a
greater
one
if
he
could
find
one
of
his
mechanical
ability
to
play
first
base
and
he
could
sit
on
the
bench
as
the
director
general
he
is
occupied
with
the
duties
of
his
position
and
often
little
things
get
by
him
i
believe
that
we
beat
the
cubs
in
two
games
in
because
chance
was
playing
first
base
instead
of
directing
the
game
from
the
bench
in
the
first
contest
ames
was
pitching
and
schlei
catching
now
schlei
was
no
three
hundred
hitter
but
he
was
a
good
man
in
a
pinch
and
looked
like
wagner
when
compared
to
ames
as
a
swatter
schlei
came
up
to
the
bat
with
men
on
second
and
third
bases
two
out
and
a
chance
to
win
or
put
us
ahead
if
he
could
make
a
hit
the
first
time
it
happened
mcgraw
unfolded
his
arms
and
relaxed
which
is
a
sign
that
he
is
conceding
something
for
the
time
being
no
use
he
said
all
those
runners
are
going
to
waste
we
have
to
make
another
try
in
the
next
inning
they
will
surely
pass
schlei
to
take
a
chance
on
ames
then
overall
who
was
pitching
whistled
a
strike
over
the
plate
and
mcgraw
body
tightened
and
the
old
lines
around
the
mouth
appeared
here
was
a
chance
yet
they
going
to
let
him
hit
he
cried
joyfully
schlei
made
a
base
hit
on
the
next
pitch
and
scored
both
men
almost
the
same
thing
happened
later
on
in
the
season
with
men
on
second
and
third
bases
and
raymond
another
featherweight
hitter
pitching
it
struck
me
as
being
an
oversight
on
the
part
of
chance
on
both
occasions
probably
because
he
was
so
busy
with
his
own
position
and
watching
the
players
on
the
field
that
he
did
notice
the
pitcher
was
the
next
batter
he
let
schlei
hit
each
time
which
probably
cost
him
two
games
the
giants
were
playing
louis
at
the
polo
grounds
in
and
i
was
pitching
against
harmon
i
held
the
cardinals
to
one
hit
up
to
the
ninth
inning
and
we
had
the
game
won
by
the
score
of
to
when
their
first
batter
in
the
ninth
walked
then
after
two
had
been
put
out
another
scratched
a
hit
it
looked
as
if
we
still
had
the
game
won
since
only
one
man
was
left
to
be
put
out
and
the
runners
were
on
first
and
second
bases
mowrey
the
third
baseman
came
to
the
bat
murray
playing
too
near
centre
field
for
this
fellow
remarked
mcgraw
to
some
of
the
players
on
the
bench
hardly
had
he
said
it
when
mowrey
shoved
a
long
fly
to
right
field
which
soared
away
toward
the
stand
murray
started
to
run
with
the
ball
for
a
minute
it
looked
as
if
he
were
going
to
get
there
and
then
it
just
tipped
his
outstretched
hands
as
it
fell
to
the
ground
it
amounted
to
a
hit
and
won
the
game
for
the
cardinals
by
the
score
of
to
i
knew
it
said
mcgraw
one
of
whose
many
rôles
is
as
a
prophet
of
evil
did
i
call
the
turn
i
ought
to
have
gone
out
there
and
stopped
the
game
and
moved
murray
over
i
blame
myself
for
that
hit
that
was
a
game
in
which
the
louis
batters
made
three
hits
and
won
it
it
is
the
number
of
hits
so
much
as
when
they
come
that
wins
ball
games
frequently
mcgraw
will
stop
a
game
bring
it
to
a
dead
standstill
by
walking
out
from
the
bench
as
the
pitcher
is
about
to
wind
up
stop
it
a
minute
meyers
he
will
shout
pull
snodgrass
in
a
little
bit
for
this
fellow
the
man
interested
in
statistics
would
be
surprised
at
how
many
times
little
moves
of
this
sort
have
saved
games
but
for
the
mcgraw
system
to
be
effective
he
must
have
working
for
him
a
set
of
players
who
are
taking
the
old
look
around
for
orders
all
the
time
he
has
a
way
of
inducing
the
men
to
keep
their
heads
up
which
has
worked
very
well
if
a
player
has
been
slow
or
has
not
taken
all
the
distance
mcgraw
believes
is
possible
on
a
hit
he
often
finds
less
in
his
pay
envelope
at
the
end
of
the
month
and
the
conversation
on
the
bench
at
times
when
men
have
made
errors
of
omission
would
not
fit
into
any
room
during
a
game
for
the
most
part
mcgraw
is
silent
concentrating
his
attention
on
the
game
and
the
players
talk
in
low
tones
as
if
in
church
discussing
the
progress
of
the
contest
but
let
a
player
make
a
bad
break
and
mcgraw
delivers
a
talk
to
him
that
would
have
to
be
written
on
asbestos
paper
arthur
wilson
was
coaching
at
third
base
in
one
of
the
games
in
a
series
played
in
philadelphia
the
first
part
of
september
there
were
barely
enough
pitchers
to
go
around
at
the
time
and
mcgraw
was
very
careful
to
take
advantage
of
every
little
point
so
that
nothing
would
be
wasted
he
feels
that
if
a
game
is
lost
because
the
other
side
is
better
there
is
some
excuse
but
if
it
goes
because
some
one
head
should
be
used
for
furniture
instead
of
thinking
baseball
it
is
like
losing
money
that
might
have
been
spent
fletcher
was
on
second
base
when
meyers
came
to
bat
the
indian
pushed
the
ball
to
right
field
along
the
line
fletcher
came
steaming
around
third
base
and
could
have
rolled
home
safely
but
wilson
misjudging
the
hit
rushed
out
tackled
him
and
threw
him
back
on
the
bag
even
the
plodding
meyers
reached
second
on
the
hit
and
mcgraw
was
boiling
he
promptly
sent
a
coacher
out
to
relieve
wilson
and
his
oratory
to
the
young
catcher
would
have
made
a
billingsgate
fishwife
sore
we
eventually
won
the
game
but
at
this
time
there
was
only
a
difference
of
something
like
one
and
it
would
have
been
a
big
relief
to
have
seen
that
run
which
wilson
interrupted
across
the
plate
mcgraw
is
always
on
devore
hip
because
he
often
feels
that
this
brilliant
young
player
does
not
get
as
much
out
of
his
natural
ability
as
he
might
he
is
frequently
listless
and
often
after
a
good
hit
he
will
feel
satisfied
with
himself
and
fan
out
a
couple
of
times
so
mcgraw
does
all
that
he
can
to
discourage
this
josh
is
a
great
man
in
a
pinch
for
he
hangs
on
like
a
bulldog
and
instead
of
getting
nervous
works
the
harder
if
the
reader
will
consult
past
history
he
will
note
that
it
was
a
pinch
hit
by
devore
which
won
the
first
game
and
one
of
his
wallops
combined
with
a
timely
bingle
by
crandall
was
largely
instrumental
in
bringing
the
second
victory
to
the
giants
mcgraw
has
made
devore
the
that
he
is
by
skilful
handling
the
giants
were
having
a
nip
and
tuck
game
with
the
cubs
in
the
early
part
of
last
summer
when
devore
came
to
the
bat
in
one
of
those
pinches
and
shot
a
three
bagger
over
third
base
which
won
the
game
as
he
slid
into
third
and
picked
himself
up
feeling
like
more
or
less
of
a
hero
because
the
crowd
was
announcing
this
fact
to
him
by
prolonged
cheers
mcgraw
said
gee
you
a
lucky
guy
i
wish
i
had
your
luck
you
were
shot
full
of
horseshoes
to
get
that
one
when
i
saw
you
shut
your
eyes
i
never
thought
you
would
hit
it
this
was
like
pricking
a
bubble
and
josh
chest
returned
to
its
normal
measure
marquard
is
another
man
whom
mcgraw
constantly
subjects
to
a
conversational
massage
devore
and
marquard
room
together
on
the
road
and
they
got
to
talking
about
their
suite
at
the
hotel
during
a
close
game
in
philadelphia
one
day
it
annoys
mcgraw
to
hear
his
men
discussing
subjects
during
a
critical
contest
because
it
not
only
distracts
their
attention
but
his
and
that
of
the
other
players
ai
that
room
of
ours
a
dandy
rube
asked
devore
best
in
the
lot
replied
marquard
it
got
five
windows
and
swell
furniture
said
devore
solid
mahogany
said
mcgraw
who
apparently
had
been
paying
no
attention
to
the
conversation
that
is
judging
by
some
of
the
plays
i
have
seen
you
two
pull
now
can
the
conversation
devore
went
down
into
cuba
with
the
giants
carrying
quite
a
bank
roll
from
the
world
series
and
the
idea
that
he
was
on
a
picnic
he
started
a
personally
conducted
tour
of
havana
on
his
first
night
there
and
we
lost
the
game
the
next
day
josh
overlooking
several
swell
opportunities
to
make
hits
in

in
fact
he
did
even
get
a
foul
you
are
fined
said
mcgraw
to
him
after
the
game
you
ca
fine
me
said
devore
i
not
under
contract
then
you
take
the
next
boat
home
replied
the
manager
i
did
come
down
here
to
let
a
lot
of
cubans
show
me
up
you
got
to
either
play
ball
or
go
home
devore
made
four
hits
the
next
day
in
giving
his
signs
from
the
bench
to
the
players
mcgraw
depends
on
a
gesture
or
catch
word
when
dummy
taylor
the
deaf
and
dumb
twirler
was
with
the
club
all
the
players
learned
the
deaf
and
dumb
language
this
medium
was
used
for
signing
for
a
time
until
smart
ball
players
like
evers
and
leach
took
up
the
study
of
it
and
became
so
proficient
they
could
converse
fluently
on
their
fingers
but
they
were
also
great
listeners
and
we
did
discover
for
some
time
that
this
was
how
they
were
getting
our
signs
thereafter
we
only
used
the
language
for
social
purposes
evers
and
mcgraw
got
into
a
conversation
one
day
in
the
deaf
and
dumb
language
at
long
range
and
johnny
evers
threw
a
finger
out
of
joint
replying
to
mcgraw
in
a
brilliant
flash
of
repartee
every
successful
manager
is
a
distinct
type
each
plays
the
game
from
the
bench
connie
mack
gives
his
men
more
liberty
than
most
chance
rules
for
the
most
part
with
an
iron
hand
bresnahan
is
ever
spurring
his
men
on
chance
changes
his
seat
on
the
bench
and
there
is
a
double
steal
connie
mack
uncrosses
his
legs
and
the
hit
and
run
is
tried
most
managers
transmit
their
signs
by
movements
or
words
jennings
is
supposed
to
have
hidden
in
his
jumble
of
jibes
some
catch
words
the
manager
on
the
bench
must
know
just
when
to
change
pitchers
he
has
to
decide
the
exact
time
to
send
in
a
substitute
hitter
when
to
install
another
base
runner
all
these
decisions
must
be
made
in
the
batting
of
an
eye
it
takes
quick
and
accurate
judgment
and
the
successful
manager
must
be
right
usually
that
playing
the
game
from
the
bench
vi
coaching
good
and
bad
is
divided
into
three
parts
offensive
defensive
and
the
use
of
crowds
to
rattle
players
why
mcgraw
developed
scientific
coaching
the
important
rôle
a
coacher
plays
in
the
crisis
of
a
big
league
ball
game
when
on
his
orders
hangs
victory
or
critical
moments
occur
in
every
close
ball
game
when
coaching
may
win
or
lose
it
that
was
the
stage
for
you
to
try
to
score
yelled
john
mcgraw
the
manager
of
the
giants
at
josh
devore
as
the
new
york
attempted
to
count
from
second
base
on
a
short
hit
to
left
field
with
no
one
out
and
the
team
one
run
behind
in
a
game
with
the
pirates
one
day
in
when
every
contest
might
mean
the
winning
or
losing
of
the
pennant
first
time
in
my
life
i
was
ever
thrown
out
trying
to
score
from
second
on
a
base
hit
to
the
outfield
answered
devore
and
besides
the
coacher
sent
me
in
i
do
care
replied
mcgraw
that
was
a
two
out
play
as
a
matter
of
fact
one
of
the
younger
players
on
the
team
was
coaching
at
third
base
at
the
time
and
made
an
error
of
judgment
in
sending
devore
home
of
which
an
older
head
would
not
have
been
guilty
and
the
pirates
beat
us
by
just
that
one
run
the
coacher
sacrificed
the
next
batter
came
through
with
an
outfield
fly
which
would
have
scored
devore
from
third
base
easily
probably
no
more
wily
general
ever
crouched
on
the
coaching
line
at
third
base
than
john
mcgraw
his
judgment
in
holding
runners
or
urging
them
on
to
score
is
almost
uncanny
governed
by
no
set
rules
himself
he
has
formulated
a
list
of
regulations
for
his
players
which
might
be
called
the
mcgraw
coaching
curriculum
he
has
favorite
expressions
such
as
there
are
stages
and
that
was
a
two
out
play
which
mean
certain
chances
are
to
be
taken
by
a
coacher
at
one
point
in
a
contest
while
to
attempt
such
a
play
under
other
circumstances
would
be
nothing
short
of
foolhardy
with
the
development
of
baseball
coaching
has
advanced
until
it
is
now
an
exact
science
for
many
years
the
two
men
who
stood
at
first
and
third
bases
were
stationed
there
merely
to
bullyrag
and
abuse
the
pitchers
often
using
language
that
was
a
disgrace
to
a
ball
field
when
they
were
not
busy
with
this
part
of
their
art
they
handed
helpful
hints
to
the
runners
as
to
where
the
ball
was
and
whether
the
second
baseman
was
concealing
it
under
his
shirt
a
favorite
trick
of
the
old
days
while
the
pitcher
pretended
to
prepare
to
deliver
it
but
as
rules
were
made
which
strictly
forbade
the
use
of
indecent
language
to
a
pitcher
and
as
the
old
school
of
clowns
passed
coaching
developed
into
a
science
and
the
sentries
stationed
at
first
and
third
bases
found
themselves
occupying
important
jobs
for
some
time
mcgraw
frowned
down
upon
scientific
coaching
until
its
value
was
forcibly
brought
home
to
him
one
day
by
an
incident
that
occurred
at
the
polo
grounds
and
since
then
he
has
developed
it
until
his
knowledge
of
advising
base
runners
is
the
pinnacle
of
scientific
coaching
a
few
years
ago
the
giants
were
having
a
nip
and
tuck
struggle
one
day
when
harry
mccormick
then
the
came
to
the
plate
and
knocked
the
ball
to
the
old
ropes
he
sped
around
the
bases
and
when
he
reached
third
it
looked
as
if
he
could
roll
home
ahead
of
the
ball
cy
seymour
was
coaching
and
surprised
everybody
by
rushing
out
and
tackling
mccormick
throwing
him
down
and
trying
to
force
him
back
to
third
base
but
big
mccormick
got
the
best
of
the
struggle
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
finally
scored
after
overcoming
the
obstacle
that
seymour
made
that
run
won
the
game
what
was
the
matter
with
you
cy
asked
mcgraw
as
seymour
came
to
the
bench
after
he
had
almost
lost
the
game
by
his
poor
coaching
the
sun
got
in
my
eyes
and
i
could
see
the
ball
replied
seymour
you
better
wear
smoked
glasses
the
next
time
you
go
out
to
coach
replied
the
manager
the
batter
was
hitting
the
ball
due
east
and
the
game
was
being
played
in
the
afternoon
so
seymour
had
no
alibi
from
the
moment
cy
made
that
mistake
mcgraw
realized
the
value
of
scientific
coaching
which
means
making
the
most
of
every
hit
in
a
game
i
have
always
held
that
a
good
actor
with
a
knowledge
of
baseball
would
make
a
good
coacher
because
it
is
the
acting
that
impresses
a
base
runner
not
the
talking
more
often
than
not
the
conversation
of
a
coacher
be
it
ever
so
brilliant
is
not
audible
above
the
screeching
of
the
crowd
at
critical
moments
and
i
believe
that
mcgraw
is
a
great
actor
at
least
of
the
baseball
school
the
cheering
of
the
immense
crowds
which
attend
ball
games
if
it
can
be
organized
is
a
potent
factor
in
winning
or
losing
them
mcgraw
gets
the
most
out
of
a
throng
by
his
clever
acting
did
any
patron
of
the
polo
grounds
ever
see
him
turn
to
the
stands
or
make
any
pretence
that
he
was
paying
attention
to
the
spectators
does
he
ever
play
to
the
gallery
yet
it
is
admitted
that
he
can
do
more
with
a
crowd
make
it
more
malleable
than
any
other
man
in
baseball
the
attitude
of
the
spectators
makes
a
lot
of
difference
to
a
ball
club
a
lackadaisical
crowd
often
results
in
the
team
playing
slovenly
ball
while
a
lively
throng
can
inject
ginger
into
the
men
and
put
the
whole
club
on
its
toes
mcgraw
is
skilled
in
getting
the
most
out
of
the
spectators
without
letting
them
know
that
he
is
doing
it
did
you
ever
watch
the
little
manager
crouching
immovable
at
third
base
with
a
mitt
on
his
hand
when
the
new
york
club
goes
to
bat
in
the
seventh
inning
two
runs
behind
the
first
hitter
gets
a
base
on
balls
mcgraw
leaps
into
the
air
kicks
his
heels
together
claps
his
mitt
shouts
at
the
umpire
runs
in
and
pats
the
next
batter
on
the
back
and
says
something
to
the
pitcher
the
crowd
gets
it
cue
wakes
up
and
leaps
into
the
air
kicking
its
heels
together
the
whole
atmosphere
inside
the
park
is
changed
in
a
minute
and
the
air
is
bristling
with
enthusiasm
the
other
coacher
at
first
base
is
waving
his
hands
and
running
up
and
down
the
line
while
the
men
on
the
bench
have
apparently
gained
new
hope
they
are
moving
about
restlessly
and
the
next
two
hitters
are
swinging
their
bats
in
anticipation
with
a
vigor
which
augurs
ill
for
the
pitcher
the
game
has
found
ponce
de
leon
fountain
of
youth
and
the
little
silent
actor
on
the
third
base
coaching
line
is
the
cause
of
the
change
nick
altrock
the
old
pitcher
on
the
chicago
white
sox
was
one
of
the
most
skilful
men
at
handling
a
crowd
that
the
game
has
ever
developed
as
a
pitcher
altrock
was
largely
instrumental
in
bringing
a
championship
to
the
american
league
team
in
and
as
a
coacher
after
his
big
league
pitching
days
were
nearly
done
he
won
many
a
game
by
his
work
on
the
lines
in
pinches
baseball
has
produced
several
comedians
some
with
questionable
ratings
as
humorists
there
is
germany
schaefer
of
the
washington
team
and
there
were
rube
waddell
bugs
raymond
and
others
but
nick
altrock
could
give
the
best
that
the
game
has
brought
out
in
the
way
of
players
a
terrible
battle
for
the
honors
at
the
old
south
side
park
in
chicago
i
have
seen
him
go
to
the
lines
with
a
catcher
mitt
and
a
glove
on
his
hands
and
lead
the
untrained
mob
as
skilfully
as
one
of
those
pompadoured
young
men
with
a
megaphone
does
the
undergraduates
at
a
college
football
game
my
experience
as
a
pitcher
has
been
that
it
is
not
the
steady
unbroken
flood
of
howling
and
yelling
with
the
incessant
pounding
of
feet
that
gets
on
the
nerves
of
a
but
the
broken
rhythmical
waves
of
sound
or
the
constant
reiteration
of
one
expression
a
man
gets
accustomed
to
the
steady
cheering
it
becomes
a
part
of
the
game
and
his
surroundings
as
much
as
the
stands
and
the
crowd
itself
are
and
he
does
not
know
that
it
is
there
let
the
coacher
be
clever
enough
to
induce
a
crowd
to
repeat
over
and
over
just
one
sentence
such
as
get
a
hit
get
a
hit
and
it
wears
on
the
steadiest
nerves
nick
altrock
had
his
baseball
chorus
trained
so
that
by
a
certain
motion
of
the
arm
he
could
get
the
crowd
to
do
this
at
the
right
moment
but
the
science
of
coaching
means
much
more
than
using
the
crowd
all
coaching
like
all
gaul
and
four
or
five
other
things
is
divided
into
three
parts
defensive
coaching
offensive
coaching
and
the
use
of
the
crowd
offensive
coaching
means
the
handling
of
base
runners
and
requires
quick
and
accurate
judgment
the
defensive
sort
is
the
advice
that
one
player
on
the
field
gives
another
as
to
where
to
throw
the
ball
who
shall
take
a
hit
and
how
the
base
runner
is
coming
into
the
bag
there
is
a
of
defensive
coaching
which
might
be
called
the
illegitimate
brand
it
is
giving
phoney
advice
to
a
base
runner
by
the
fielders
of
the
other
side
that
may
lead
him
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
to
make
a
foolish
play
this
style
has
developed
largely
in
the
big
leagues
in
the
last
three
or
four
years
offensive
coaching
in
my
opinion
is
the
most
important
for
a
man
to
be
a
good
coacher
he
must
be
trained
for
the
work
the
best
coachers
are
the
seasoned
players
the
veterans
of
the
game
a
man
must
know
the
throwing
ability
of
each
outfielder
on
the
opposing
club
he
must
be
familiar
with
the
speed
of
the
base
runner
whom
he
is
handling
and
he
must
be
so
closely
acquainted
with
the
game
as
a
whole
that
he
knows
the
stages
at
which
to
try
a
certain
play
and
the
circumstances
under
which
the
same
attempt
would
be
foolish
above
all
things
he
must
be
a
quick
thinker
watch
mcgraw
on
the
coaching
lines
some
day
as
he
crouches
he
picks
up
a
pebble
and
throws
it
out
of
his
way
and
two
base
runners
start
a
double
steal
hughie
jennings
emits
his
famous
and
the
third
baseman
creeps
in
expecting
cobb
to
bunt
with
a
man
on
first
base
and
no
one
out
the
hitter
pushes
the
ball
on
a
line
past
the
third
baseman
the
next
time
jennings
shrieks
his
famous
it
has
a
different
intonation
and
the
batter
bunts
bill
dahlen
of
the
brooklyn
club
shouts
watch
his
foot
and
the
base
runner
starts
while
the
batter
smashes
the
ball
on
a
hit
and
run
play
again
the
pitcher
hears
that
watch
his
foot
he
wastes
one
so
that
the
batter
will
not
get
a
chance
at
the
ball
and
turns
to
first
base
he
is
surprised
to
find
the
runner
anchored
there
nothing
has
happened
so
it
will
be
seen
that
the
offensive
coacher
controls
the
situation
and
directs
the
plays
usually
taking
his
orders
from
the
manager
if
the
boss
himself
is
not
on
the
lines
in
the
giants
led
the
national
league
by
a
good
margin
in
stealing
bases
and
to
this
speed
many
critics
attributed
the
fact
that
the
championship
was
won
by
the
club
i
can
safely
say
that
every
base
which
was
pilfered
by
a
new
york
runner
was
stolen
by
the
direct
order
of
mcgraw
except
in
the
few
games
from
which
he
was
absent
then
his
lieutenants
followed
his
system
as
closely
as
any
one
can
pursue
the
involved
and
intricate
style
that
he
alone
understands
if
it
was
the
base
running
of
the
giants
that
won
the
pennant
for
the
club
then
it
was
the
coaching
of
mcgraw
employing
the
speed
of
his
men
and
his
opportunities
which
brought
the
championship
to
new
york
the
first
thing
that
every
manager
teaches
his
players
now
is
to
obey
absolutely
the
orders
of
the
coacher
and
then
he
selects
able
men
to
give
the
advice
the
brain
of
mcgraw
is
behind
each
game
the
giants
play
and
he
plans
every
move
most
of
the
hitters
going
to
the
plate
with
definite
instructions
from
him
as
to
what
to
try
to
do
in
order
to
make
this
system
efficient
absolute
discipline
must
be
assured
if
a
player
has
other
ideas
than
mcgraw
as
to
what
should
be
done
mac
invariable
answer
to
him
is
you
do
what
i
tell
you
and
i
take
the
responsibility
if
we
lose
for
two
months
at
the
end
of
mcgraw
would
not
let
either
josh
devore
or
john
murray
swing
at
a
first
ball
pitched
to
them
murray
did
this
one
day
after
he
had
been
ordered
not
to
and
he
was
promptly
fined
and
sat
down
on
the
bench
while
becker
played
right
field
many
fans
doubtless
recall
the
substitution
of
becker
but
could
not
understand
the
move
murray
and
devore
are
what
are
known
in
baseball
as
hitters
that
is
they
invariably
hit
at
the
first
one
delivered
they
watch
a
pitcher
wind
up
and
swing
their
bats
involuntarily
as
a
man
blinks
his
eyes
when
he
sees
a
blow
started
it
is
probably
due
to
slight
nervousness
the
result
was
that
the
news
of
this
weakness
spread
rapidly
around
the
circuit
by
the
underground
routes
of
baseball
and
every
pitcher
in
the
league
was
handing
devore
and
murray
a
bad
ball
on
the
first
one
of
course
each
would
miss
it
or
else
make
a
dinky
little
hit
they
were
always
in
the
hole
which
means
that
the
pitcher
had
the
advantage
in
the
count
mcgraw
became
exasperated
after
devore
had
fanned
out
three
times
one
day
by
getting
bad
starts
hitting
at
the
first
ball
after
this
said
mcgraw
to
both
murray
and
devore
in
the
clubhouse
if
either
of
you
moves
his
bat
off
his
shoulder
at
a
first
ball
even
if
it
cuts
the
plate
you
will
be
fined
and
sat
down
murray
forgot
the
next
day
saw
the
pitcher
wind
up
and
swung
his
bat
at
the
first
one
he
spent
the
rest
of
the
month
on
the
bench
but
hitting
improved
at
once
because
all
the
pitchers
expecting
him
to
swing
at
the
first
one
were
surprised
to
find
him
taking
it
and
as
it
was
usually
bad
he
had
the
pitcher
constantly
in
the
hole
instead
of
being
at
a
disadvantage
himself
for
this
reason
he
was
able
to
guess
more
accurately
what
the
pitcher
was
going
to
throw
and
his
hitting
consequently
improved
so
did
murray
after
he
had
served
his
term
on
the
bench
the
hit
well
up
to
the
world
series
and
then
he
just
struck
a
slump
that
any
player
is
liable
to
encounter
but
so
dependent
is
mcgraw
system
on
absolute
discipline
for
its
success
that
he
dispensed
with
the
services
of
a
good
player
for
a
month
to
preserve
his
style
in
contrast
connie
mack
the
manager
of
the
athletics
and
by
many
declared
to
be
the
greatest
leader
in
the
country
although
each
private
of
course
is
true
to
his
own
general
lets
his
players
use
their
own
judgment
largely
he
seldom
gives
a
batter
a
direct
order
unless
the
pinch
is
very
stringent
the
most
difficult
position
to
fill
as
a
coacher
is
at
third
base
the
critical
corner
there
a
man
judgment
must
be
lightning
fast
and
always
accurate
he
encourages
runners
with
his
voice
but
his
orders
are
given
primarily
with
his
hands
because
often
the
noise
made
by
the
crowd
drowns
out
the
shouted
instructions
last
he
must
be
prepared
to
handle
all
sorts
of
base
running
on
nearly
every
ball
club
there
are
some
players
who
are
known
in
the
frank
parlance
of
the
profession
as
hog
wild
runners
the
expression
means
that
these
players
are
bitten
by
a
sort
of
bug
which
causes
them
to
lose
their
heads
when
once
they
get
on
the
bases
they
can
not
be
stopped
oftentimes
fighting
with
a
coacher
to
go
on
to
the
next
base
when
it
is
easy
to
see
that
if
the
attempt
is
made
the
runner
is
doomed
new
york
fans
have
often
seen
mcgraw
dash
out
into
the
line
at
third
base
tackle
murray
and
throw
him
back
on
the
bag
he
is
a
hog
wild
runner
and
with
him
on
the
bases
the
duties
of
a
coacher
become
more
arduous
he
will
insist
on
scoring
if
he
is
not
stopped
or
does
not
drop
dead
some
youngster
was
coaching
on
third
base
in
a
game
with
boston
in
the
summer
of
and
the
giants
had
a
comfortable
lead
of
several
runs
murray
was
on
second
when
the
batter
hit
clearly
and
sharply
to
left
field
murray
started
and
with
his
usual
intensity
of
purpose
rounded
third
base
at
top
speed
bound
to
score
the
ball
was
already
on
the
way
home
when
murray
about
ten
feet
from
the
bag
tripped
and
fell
he
scrambled
safely
back
to
the
cushion
on
all
fours
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
this
is
his
third
year
with
me
laughed
mcgraw
on
the
bench
and
the
first
time
he
has
ever
failed
to
try
to
score
from
second
base
on
a
hit
unless
he
was
tackled
all
ball
clubs
have
certain
must
motions
which
are
as
strictly
observed
as
danger
signals
on
a
railroad
a
coacher
hand
upraised
will
stop
a
base
runner
as
abruptly
as
the
uplifted
white
glove
of
a
traffic
policeman
halts
a
row
of
automobiles
a
wave
of
the
arm
will
start
a
runner
going
at
top
speed
again
many
times
a
wins
a
game
for
his
club
by
his
snap
judgment
again
mcgraw
is
the
master
of
that
he
took
a
game
from
the
cubs
in
because
always
alert
for
flaws
in
the
opposition
he
noticed
the
drop
his
arm
after
getting
set
to
throw
the
ball
home
devore
was
on
second
base
and
one
run
was
needed
to
win
the
game
doyle
hit
sharply
to
centre
field
and
devore
coming
from
second
started
to
slow
up
as
he
rounded
third
hofman
the
chicago
perceiving
this
slackening
of
pace
dropped
his
arm
mcgraw
noticed
this
and
with
a
wave
of
his
arm
notified
devore
to
go
home
with
two
strides
he
was
at
top
speed
again
and
hofman
taken
by
surprise
threw
badly
the
run
scored
which
won
the
game
the
pastime
of
bullyragging
the
pitcher
by
the
coachers
has
lost
its
popularity
recently
the
wily
coacher
must
first
judge
the
temperament
of
a
pitcher
before
he
dares
to
undertake
to
get
on
his
nerves
clarke
griffith
formerly
the
manager
of
cincinnati
has
a
reputation
for
being
able
to
ruin
young
pitchers
just
attempting
to
establish
themselves
in
the
big
league
time
and
again
he
has
forced
youngsters
back
to
the
minors
by
his
constant
cry
of
watch
his
foot

alexander
the
sensational
pitcher
of
the
philadelphia
club
it
was
at
his
first
appearance
in
cincinnati
that
the
young
fellow
got
into
the
hole
with
several
men
on
the
bases
and

griffith
at

show

a
streak
that
you

be
able

declared
alexander
and
then
he
struck
mitchell
out
griffith
had
tried
the
wrong
tactics
a
story
is
told
of
fred
clarke
and
rube
waddell
the
eccentric
twirler
waddell
was
once
one
of
the
best
pitchers
in
the
business
when
he
could
concentrate
his
attention
on
his
work
but
his
mind
wandered
easily
now
pay
no
attention
to
clarke
warned
his
manager
before
the
game
clarke
tried
everything
from
cajolery
to
abuse
on
waddell
with
no
effect
because
the
eccentric
rube
had
been
tipped
to
fight
shy
of
the
pittsburg
manager
suddenly
clarke
became
friendly
and
walked
with
waddell
between
innings
chatting
on
trivial
matters
at
last
he
said
why
do
you
come
out
on
my
ranch
in
kansas
and
hunt
after
the
season
george
i
got
a
dog
out
there
you
might
train
what
kind
of
a
dog
asked
waddell
at
once
interested
just
a
pup
replied
clarke
and
you
can
have
him
if
he
takes
a
fancy
to
you
they
all
do
replied
waddell
he
as
good
as
mine
the
next
inning
the
big
was
still
thinking
of
that
dog
and
the
pirates
made
five
runs
in
many
instances
defensive
coaching
is
as
important
as
the
offensive
brand
which
simply
indorses
the
old
axiom
that
any
chain
is
only
as
strong
as
its
weakest
link
or
any
ball
club
is
only
as
efficient
as
its
most
deficient
department
when
roger
bresnahan
was
on
the
giants
he
was
one
of
those
aggressive
players
who
are
always
coaching
the
other
fielders
and
holding
a
team
together
a
type
so
much
desired
by
a
manager
if
a
slow
roller
was
hit
between
the
pitcher
box
and
third
base
i
could
always
hear
rog
yelling
you
take
it
matty
or
artie
artie
meaning
devlin
the
third
baseman
he
was
in
a
position
to
see
which
man
would
be
better
able
to
make
the
play
and
he
gave
this
helpful
advice
his
coaching
saved
many
a
game
for
the
giants
in
the
old
days
al
bridwell
the
former
shortstop
was
of
the
same
type
and
if
you
have
ever
attended
a
ball
game
at
the
polo
grounds
you
have
doubtless
heard
him
in
his
shrill
piercing
voice
shouting
i
got
it
i
got
it
or
you
take
it
this
style
of
coaching
saves
from
accidents
and
accidents
have
lost
many
a
pennant
i
have
always
held
that
it
was
a
lack
of
the
proper
coaching
that
sent
cy
seymour
formerly
the
giant
out
of
the
big
leagues
and
back
to
the
minors
both
murray
and
he
attempted
to
catch
the
same
fly
in
the
season
of
and
came
into
collision
seymour
went
down
on
the
field
but
later
got
up
and
played
the
game
out
however
he
hurt
his
leg
so
badly
that
it
never
regained
its
strength
then
there
is
that
other
style
of
defensive
coaching
which
is
the
shouting
of
misleading
advice
by
the
fielders
to
the
base
runners
collins
and
barry
the
second
baseman
and
shortstop
on
the
athletics
worked
a
clever
trick
in
one
of
the
games
of
the
world
series
which
illustrates
my
point
the
play
is
as
old
as
the
one
in
which
the
second
baseman
hides
the
ball
under
his
shirt
so
as
to
catch
a
man
asleep
off
first
base
but
often
the
old
ones
are
the
more
effective
doyle
was
on
first
base
in
one
of
the
contests
played
in
philadelphia
and
the
batter
lifted
a
short
foul
fly
to
baker
playing
third
base
the
crowd
roared
and
the
coacher
voice
was
drowned
by
the
volume
of
sound
eddie
collins
ran
to
cover
second
base
and
barry
scrabbled
his
hand
along
the
dirt
as
if
preparing
to
field
a
ground
ball
throw
it
here
throw
it
here
yelled
collins
and
doyle
thinking
that
they
were
trying
for
a
force
play
increased
his
efforts
to
reach
second
baker
caught
the
fly
and
larry
was
doubled
up
at
first
base
so
far
that
he
looked
foolish
yet
it
really
was
not
his
fault
the
safest
thing
for
a
base
runner
to
do
under
those
circumstances
is
to
get
one
glimpse
of
the
coacher
motions
and
then
he
can
tell
whether
to
go
back
or
to
go
on
johnnie
kling
the
old
catcher
of
the
chicago
cubs
used
to
work
a
clever
piece
of
defensive
coaching
with
john
evers
the
second
baseman
this
was
tried
on
young
players
and
usually
was
successful
the
victim
was
picked
out
before
the
game
and
the
play
depended
upon
him
arriving
at
second
base
once
there
the
schemers
worked
it
as
follows
when
the
busher
was
found
taking
a
large
lead
evers
would
dash
to
the
bag
and
kling
would
make
a
bluff
to
throw
the
ball
but
hold
it
the
runner
naturally
scampered
for
the
base
then
seeing
that
kling
had
not
thrown
he
would
start
to
walk
away
from
it
again
if
the
jew
had
thrown
that
time
he
would
have
had
you
evers
would
carelessly
hurl
over
his
shoulder
at
the
intended
victim
the
man
usually
turned
for
a
fatal
second
to
reply
tinker
who
was
playing
shortstop
rushed
in
from
behind
kling
whipped
the
ball
to
the
bag
and
the
man
caught
off
his
guard
was
tagged
out
the
play
was
really
made
before
the
game
when
the
victim
was
selected
it
was
this
same
combination
that
turned
the
tide
in
the
first
inning
of
the
most
famous
game
ever
played
in
baseball
the
extra
one
between
the
giants
and
the
cubs
in
the
season
of
the
chicago
club
was
nervous
in
the
first
inning
tenney
was
hit
by
a
pitched
ball
and
herzog
walked
it
looked
as
if
pfeister
the
chicago
pitcher
was
losing
his
grip
bresnahan
struck
out
and
kling
always
alert
dropped
the
third
strike
but
conveniently
at
his
feet
thinking
that
here
was
an
opportunity
the
crowd
roared
evers
playing
deep
almost
behind
herzog
shouted
go
on
herzog
took
the
bait
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
and
ran
and
was
nipped
many
yards
from
first
base
there
are
many
tricks
to
the
coacher
trade
both
offensive
and
defensive
and
it
is
the
man
who
is
the
best
coacher
the
sentry
at
first
yells
as
the
pitcher
winds
up
there
he
goes
imitating
the
first
baseman
as
nearly
as
possible
in
the
hope
that
the
twirler
will
waste
one
by
pitching
out
and
thus
give
the
batter
an
advantage
the
coacher
on
third
base
will
shout
at
the
runner
on
a
short
hit
to
the
outfield
take
your
turn
in
the
dim
hope
that
the
fielder
seeing
the
man
rounding
third
will
throw
the
ball
home
and
the
hitter
can
thus
make
an
extra
base
and
the
job
of
coaching
is
no
sinecure
mcgraw
has
told
me
after
directing
a
hard
game
that
he
is
as
tired
as
if
he
had
played
vii
honest
and
dishonest
sign
stealing
fair
in
baseball
except
the
dishonest
stealing
of
signals
the
national
game
more
a
contest
of
the
wits
than
most
onlookers
when
the
philadelphia
athletics
unexpectedly
defeated
the
chicago
cubs
in
the
world
series
of
the
national
league
players
cried
that
their
signals
had
been
stolen
by
the
american
league
team
and
that
because
connie
mack
batters
knew
what
to
expect
they
had
won
the
championship
but
were
the
owners
or
any
member
of
the
philadelphia
club
arrested
charged
with
grand
larceny
in
stealing
the
baseball
championship
of
the
world
no
was
there
any
murmur
against
the
methods
of
connie
mack
men
no
again
by
a
strange
kink
in
the
ethics
of
baseball
john
kling
the
chicago
catcher
was
blamed
by
the
other
players
on
the
defeated
team
for
the
signs
being
stolen
they
charged
that
he
had
been
careless
in
covering
his
signals
and
that
the
enemy
coachers
particularly
topsy
hartsell
a
clever
man
at
it
had
seen
them
from
the
lines
this
was
really
the
cause
of
kling
leaving
the
cubs
and
going
to
boston
in
after
the
games
were
over
and
the
series
was
lost
many
of
the
players
and
especially
the
pitchers
would
hardly
speak
to
kling
the
man
who
had
as
much
as
any
one
else
to
do
with
the
cubs
winning
four
championships
and
the
man
who
by
his
great
throwing
had
made
the
reputations
of
a
lot
of
their
pitchers
but
the
players
were
sore
because
they
had
lost
the
series
and
lost
the
extra
money
which
many
of
them
had
counted
as
their
own
before
the
games
started
and
they
looked
around
for
some
one
to
blame
and
found
kling
one
of
the
pitchers
complained
after
he
had
lost
a
game
ca
expect
a
guy
to
win
with
his
catcher
giving
the
signs
so
the
coachers
can
read
and
tip
the
batters
and
you
ca
expect
a
catcher
to
win
a
game
for
you
if
you
have
got
anything
on
the
ball
replied
kling
for
he
is
quick
tempered
and
can
not
stand
reflections
on
his
ability
but
the
pitcher
chance
remark
had
given
the
other
players
an
excuse
for
fixing
the
blame
and
it
was
put
on
kling
i
honestly
do
not
believe
that
kling
was
in
any
way
responsible
for
the
rout
of
the
proud
cubs
the
chicago
pitchers
were
away
off
form
in
the
series
and
could
not
control
the
ball
thus
getting
themselves
into
the
hole
all
the
time
shrewd
connie
mack
soon
realized
this
and
ordered
his
batters
to
wait
everything
out
to
make
the
twirlers
throw
every
ball
possible
the
result
was
that
with
the
pitcher
continually
in
the
hole
the
batters
were
guessing
what
was
coming
and
frequently
guessing
right
as
any
smart
hitter
could
under
the
circumstances
this
made
it
look
as
if
the
athletics
were
getting
the
cubs
signals
why
i
changed
signs
every
three
innings
matty
kling
told
me
afterwards
in
discussing
the
charge
some
of
the
boys
said
that
i
gave
the
old
sign
for
a
curve
ball
well
did
you
ever
find
anything
to
improve
on
the
old
ones
that
why
they
are
old
but
the
cubs
still
point
the
finger
of
scorn
at
kling
for
it
hurts
to
lose
i
know
it
i
have
lost
myself
even
though
the
athletics
are
charged
with
stealing
the
signs
whether
they
did
or
not
it
is
no
smirch
on
the
character
of
the
club
for
they
stole
honestly
which
sounds
like
a
paradox
you
have
such
jolly
funny
morals
in
this
bally
country
declared
an
englishman
i
once
met
you
steal
and
rob
in
baseball
and
yet
you
call
it
fair
now
in
cricket
we
give
our
opponents
every
advantage
do
cher
know
and
after
the
game
we
are
all
jolly
good
fellows
at
tea
together
this
brings
us
down
to
the
ethics
of
signal
stealing
each
game
has
its
own
recognized
standards
of
fairness
for
instance
no
tricks
are
tolerated
in
tennis
yet
the
baseball
manager
who
can
devise
some
scheme
by
which
he
disconcerts
his
opponents
is
considered
a
great
leader
i
was
about
to
say
that
all
is
fair
in
love
war
and
baseball
but
will
modify
that
too
comprehensive
statement
by
saying
all
is
fair
in
love
war
and
baseball
except
stealing
signals
dishonestly
which
listens
like
another
paradox
therefore
i
shall
divide
the
subject
of
signal
stealing
into
half
portions
the
honest
and
the
dishonest
halves
and
since
we
are
dealing
in
paradoxes
take
up
the
latter
first
dishonest
signal
stealing
might
be
defined
as
obtaining
information
by
artificial
aids
the
honest
methods
are
those
requiring
cleverness
of
eye
mind
and
hand
without
outside
assistance
one
of
the
most
flagrant
and
for
a
time
successful
pieces
of
signal
stealing
occurred
in
philadelphia
several
years
ago
opposing
players
can
usually
tell
when
the
batsman
is
getting
the
signs
because
he
steps
up
and
sets
himself
for
a
curve
with
so
much
confidence
during
the
season
of
the
report
went
around
the
circuit
that
the
philadelphia
club
was
stealing
signals
because
the
batters
were
popping
them
all
on
the
nose
but
no
one
was
able
to
discover
the
transmitter
the
coachers
were
closely
watched
and
it
was
evident
that
these
sentinels
were
not
getting
the
signs
it
was
while
the
washington
club
then
in
the
national
league
was
playing
philadelphia
that
there
came
a
rainy
morning
which
made
the
field
very
wet
and
for
a
long
time
it
was
doubtful
whether
a
game
could
be
played
in
the
afternoon
but
the
washington
club
insisted
on
it
and
overruled
the
protests
of
the
phillies
arlie
latham
now
the
coacher
on
the
giants
was
playing
third
base
for
the
senators
at
the
time
he
has
told
me
often
since
how
he
discovered
the
device
by
which
the
signs
were
being
stolen
he
repeated
the
story
to
me
recently
when
i
asked
him
for
the
facts
to
use
in
this
book
there
was
a
big
puddle
in
the
third
base
coaching
box
that
day
said
latham
and
it
was
in
the
third
inning
that
i
noticed
cupid
childs
the
philadelphia
second
baseman
coaching
he
stood
with
one
foot
in
the
puddle
and
never
budged
it
although
the
water
came
up
to
his
he
usually
jumped
around
when
on
the
lines
and
this
stillness
surprised
me
go
get
your
rubbers
if
you
are
goin
to
keep
that
trilby
there
i
said
to
him
horse
and
the
rheumatism
have
no
terrors
for
you
but
he
kept
his
foot
planted
in
the
puddle
just
the
same
and
first
thing
the
batter
cracked
out
a
base
hit
that
where
you
gettin
the
signs
i
said
to
him
not
guessing
that
it
really
was
then
he
started
to
jump
around
and
we
got
the
next
two
batters
out
right
quick
there
being
a
big
slump
in
the
philadelphia
hitting
as
soon
as
he
took
his
foot
out
of
that
puddle
when
the
washington
club
went
to
bat
i
hiked
out
to
the
third
base
line
and
started
to
coach
putting
my
foot
into
the
puddle
as
near
the
place
where
childs
had
had
his
as
i
could
where
we
get
a
few
signs
i
yelled
i
ai
afraid
of
charley
horse
either
i
looked
over
at
the
philadelphia
bench
and
there
were
all
the
extra
players
sitting
with
their
caps
pulled
down
over
their
eyes
so
that
i
could
see
their
faces
the
fielders
all
looked
the
other
way
then
i
knew
i
was
on
a
warm
scent
when
the
washington
players
started
back
for
the
field
i
told
tommy
corcoran
that
i
thought
they
must
be
getting
the
signs
from
the
third
base
coaching
box
although
i
had
been
able
to
feel
anything
there
he
went
over
and
started
pawing
around
in
the
dirt
and
water
with
his
spikes
and
fingers
pretty
soon
he
dug
up
a
square
chunk
of
wood
with
a
buzzer
on
the
under
side
of
it
ought
to
help
their
hitting
a
little
he
remarked
as
he
kept
on
pulling
up
came
a
wire
and
when
he
started
to
pull
on
it
he
found
that
it
was
buried
about
an
inch
under
the
soil
and
ran
across
the
outfield
he
kept
right
on
coiling
it
up
and
following
it
like
a
hound
on
a
scent
the
philadelphia
players
being
very
busy
all
this
time
and
nervous
like
a
busher
at
his
début
into
big
league
society
one
of
the
substitutes
started
to
run
for
the
clubhouse
but
i
stopped
him
tommy
was
galloping
by
this
time
across
the
outfield
and
all
the
time
pulling
up
this
wire
it
led
straight
to
the
clubhouse
and
there
sitting
where
he
could
get
a
good
view
of
the
catcher
signs
with
a
pair
of
was
morgan
murphy
the
wire
led
right
to
him
cher
doin
asked
tommy
the
game
replied
murphy
you
see
it
easier
from
the
bench
than
lookin
through
those
peepers
from
here
and
why
are
you
connected
up
with
this
machine
inquired
tommy
showin
him
the
chunk
of
wood
with
the
buzzer
attached
guess
you
got
the
goods
murphy
answered
with
a
laugh
and
all
the
newspapers
laughed
at
it
then
too
but
the
batting
averages
of
the
philadelphia
players
took
an
awful
slump
after
that
did
they
tip
me
asked
murphy
as
he
put
aside
his
and
went
to
the
bench
and
watched
the
rest
of
the
game
from
there
and
we
later
won
that
contest
our
first
victory
of
the
series
which
was
no
discredit
to
us
since
it
was
like
gamblin
against
loaded
dice
concluded
arlie
the
newspapers
may
have
laughed
at
the
incident
in
those
days
but
since
that
time
the
national
commission
has
intimated
that
if
there
was
ever
a
recurrence
of
such
tactics
the
club
caught
using
them
would
be
subjected
to
a
heavy
fine
and
possibly
expulsion
from
the
league
so
much
have
baseball
standards
improved
the
incident
is
a
great
illustration
of
the
unfair
method
of
obtaining
signs
since
then
there
have
come
from
time
to
time
reports
of
teams
taking
signals
by
mechanical
devices
the
athletics
once
declared
that
the
american
league
team
in
new
york
had
a
man
stationed
behind
the
fence
in
centre
field
with
a
pair
of
glasses
and
that
he
shifted
a
line
in
the
score
board
slightly
so
as
to
tip
off
the
batters
but
this
charge
was
never
confirmed
it
was
said
a
short
time
ago
that
the
athletics
themselves
had
a
spy
located
in
a
house
outside
their
grounds
and
that
he
tipped
the
batters
by
raising
and
lowering
an
awning
a
trifle
when
the
giants
went
to
philadelphia
in
for
the
first
game
of
the
series
in
the
enemy
camp
i
kept
watching
the
windows
of
the
houses
just
outside
of
the
park
for
suspicious
movements
but
could
discover
none
once
in
pittsburg
i
thought
that
the
pirates
were
getting
the
signals
and
i
kept
my
eyes
glued
to
the
score
board
in
centre
field
throughout
one
whole
series
to
see
if
any
of
the
figures
moved
or
changed
positions
as
that
seemed
to
be
the
only
place
from
which
a
batter
could
be
tipped
but
i
never
discovered
anything
wrong
there
are
many
fair
ways
to
steal
the
signs
of
the
enemy
so
many
that
the
smart
is
always
kept
on
the
alert
by
them
baseball
geniuses
some
almost
magicians
are
constantly
looking
for
new
schemes
to
find
out
what
the
catcher
is
telling
the
pitcher
what
the
batter
is
tipping
the
base
runner
to
or
what
the
coacher
instructions
are
the
athletics
have
a
great
reputation
as
being
a
club
able
to
get
the
other
team
signs
if
they
are
obtainable
this
is
their
record
all
around
the
american
league
circuit
personally
i
do
not
believe
that
connie
mack
players
steal
as
much
information
as
they
get
the
credit
for
but
the
reputation
itself
if
they
never
get
a
sign
is
valuable
if
a
prizefighter
is
supposed
to
have
a
haymaking
punch
in
his
left
hand
the
other
fellow
is
going
to
be
constantly
looking
out
for
that
left
if
the
players
on
a
club
have
great
reputations
as
signal
stealers
their
opponents
are
going
to
be
on
their
guard
all
the
time
which
gives
the
team
with
the
reputation
just
that
much
advantage
if
a
pitcher
has
a
reputation
he
has
the
percentage
on
the
batter
therefore
this
gossip
about
the
ability
of
the
athletics
has
added
to
their
natural
strength
bill
i
said
to
dahlen
the
brooklyn
manager
one
day
toward
the
end
of
the
season
of
when
the
giants
were
playing
their
schedule
out
after
the
pennant
was
sure
see
if
you
can
get
the
chief
signs
dahlen
coached
on
first
base
and
then
went
to
third
always
looking
for
meyers
signals
pretty
soon
he
came
to
me
i
can
see
them
a
little
bit
matty
he
reported
chief
i
said
to
meyers
that
night
as
i
buttonholed
him
in
the
clubhouse
you
got
to
be
careful
to
cover
up
your
signs
in
the
big
series
the
athletics
have
a
reputation
of
being
pretty
slick
at
getting
them
and
to
make
sure
we
will
arrange
a
set
of
signs
that
i
can
give
if
we
think
they
are
to
yours
so
right
there
meyers
and
i
fixed
up
a
code
of
signals
that
i
could
give
to
him
the
chief
always
to
use
some
himself
which
would
be
phoney
of
course
and
might
have
the
desirable
effect
of
crossing
them
in
the
first
championship
game
at
the
polo
grounds
topsy
hartsell
was
out
on
the
coaching
lines
looking
for
signals
and
the
chief
started
giving
the
real
ones
until
davis
stepped
into
a
curve
ball
and
cracked
it
to
left
field
for
a
single
scoring
the
only
run
made
by
the
athletics
right
here
meyers
stopped
and
i
began
transmitting
the
private
information
although
the
chief
continued
to
pass
out
signals
that
meant
nothing
the
athletics
were
getting
the
indian
and
could
not
understand
why
the
answers
seemed
invariably
to
be
wrong
for
a
couple
of
them
struck
out
swinging
at
bad
balls
and
one
batter
narrowly
avoided
being
hit
by
a
fast
one
when
apparently
he
had
been
tipped
off
to
a
curve
and
was
set
ready
to
swing
at
it
they
did
not
discover
that
i
was
behind
the
signals
although
to
make
this
method
successful
the
catcher
must
be
a
clever
man
if
he
makes
it
too
obvious
that
his
signals
are
phoney
and
are
meant
to
be
seen
then
the
other
club
will
look
around
for
the
source
of
the
real
ones
meyers
carefully
concealed
his
misleading
beneath
his
chest
protector
under
his
glove
and
behind
his
knee
as
any
good
catcher
does
his
real
signs
so
they
would
not
look
at
my
head
many
persons
argue
if
a
man
sees
the
signs
what
good
does
it
do
him
if
he
does
not
know
what
they
mean
it
is
easy
for
a
smart
to
deduce
the
answers
because
there
are
only
three
real
signs
passed
between
a
pitcher
and
catcher
the
sign
for
the
fast
one
for
the
curve
ball
and
for
the
pitchout
if
a
coacher
sees
a
catcher
open
his
hand
behind
his
glove
and
then
watches
the
pitcher
throw
a
fast
one
he
is
likely
to
guess
that
the
open
palm
says
fast
one
after
a
coacher
has
stolen
the
desired
information
he
must
be
clever
to
pass
it
along
to
the
batter
without
the
other
club
being
aware
that
he
is
doing
it
he
may
straighten
up
to
tell
the
batter
a
curve
ball
is
coming
and
bend
over
to
forecast
a
fast
one
and
turn
his
back
as
a
neutral
signal
meaning
that
he
does
not
know
what
is
coming
if
a
coacher
is
smart
enough
to
pass
the
meanings
to
the
batter
without
the
other
team
getting
on
he
may
go
through
the
entire
season
as
a
transmitter
of
information
to
steal
signs
fairly
requires
quickness
of
mind
eye
and
action
few
players
can
do
it
successfully
perhaps
that
is
why
it
is
considered
fair
if
a
team
is
going
to
make
a
success
of
signal
stealing
it
must
get
every
sign
that
is
given
for
an
occasional
crumb
of
information
picked
up
at
random
is
worse
than
none
at
all
first
it
is
dangerous
a
batter
tipped
off
that
a
curved
ball
is
coming
steps
up
to
the
plate
and
is
surprised
to
meet
a
fast
one
which
often
he
has
not
time
to
dodge
many
a
good
has
been
injured
in
this
way
and
an
accident
to
a
star
has
cost
more
than
one
pennant
joe
kelley
formerly
manager
of
the
reds
was
coaching
in
cincinnati
one
day
several
years
ago
and
eagle
eye
jake
beckley
the
old
first
baseman
and
a
chronic
three
hundred
hitter
was
at
the
bat
i
had
been
feeding
him
low
drops
and
kelley
on
the
third
base
line
thought
he
was
getting
the
signals
that
jack
warner
the
giant
catcher
in
a
former
cast
of
characters
was
giving
i
saw
kelley
apparently
pass
some
information
to
beckley
and
the
latter
stepped
almost
across
the
plate
ready
for
a
curve
he
encountered
a
high
fast
one
close
in
and
he
encountered
it
with
that
part
of
him
between
his
neck
and
hat
band
eagle
eye
was
unconscious
for
two
days
after
that
and
in
the
hospital
several
weeks
when
he
got
back
into
the
game
he
said
to
me
one
day
why
did
you
throw
me
that
curve
matty
that
tipped
me
to
were
you
tipped
off
i
asked
then
it
was
error
not
mine
say
he
answered
if
i
ever
take
another
sign
from
a
coacher
i
hope
the
ball
kills
me
it
probably
will
i
replied
that
one
nearly
did
it
is
one
of
the
risks
of
signal
stealing
beckley
had
received
the
wrong
information
and
i
felt
no
qualms
at
hitting
him
for
it
was
not
a
wild
pitch
but
a
misinterpreted
signal
which
had
put
him
out
of
the
game
his
manager
not
i
was
to
blame
for
this
reason
many
nervous
players
refuse
to
accept
any
information
from
a
coacher
even
if
the
coacher
thinks
he
knows
what
is
going
to
be
pitched
because
they
do
not
dare
take
the
risk
of
getting
hit
by
a
fast
one
against
which
they
have
little
protection
if
set
for
a
curve
on
this
account
few
national
league
clubs
attempt
to
steal
signs
as
a
part
of
the
regular
team
work
but
many
individuals
make
a
practice
of
it
for
their
own
benefit
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
batter
if
he
is
not
of
the
timid
type
as
soon
as
a
runner
gets
on
second
base
he
is
in
an
excellent
position
to
see
the
hands
of
the
catcher
and
it
is
then
that
the
man
behind
the
bat
is
doing
all
that
he
can
cover
up
jack
warner
the
old
giant
used
sometimes
to
give
his
signals
with
his
mouth
in
this
emergency
because
they
were
visible
from
the
pitcher
box
but
not
from
second
base
the
thieves
were
looking
at
his
hands
for
them
in
the
national
league
leach
clarke
wagner
bresnahan
evers
tinker
and
a
few
more
of
the
sort
are
dangerous
to
have
on
second
wagner
will
get
on
the
middle
sack
and
watch
the
catcher
until
he
thinks
that
he
has
discovered
the
pitchout
sign
which
means
a
ball
is
to
be
wasted
in
the
hope
that
a
base
runner
can
be
caught
wagner
takes
a
big
lead
and
the
catcher
tempted
gives
the
office
to
waste
one
thinking
to
nail
hans
off
second
the
dutchman
sees
it
and
instead
of
running
back
to
second
dashes
for
third
he
starts
as
the
catcher
lets
go
of
the
ball
to
throw
to
second
and
can
usually
make
the
extra
base
many
coachers
who
do
not
attempt
to
get
the
signs
for
fast
and
curved
balls
study
the
catcher
to
get
his
pitchout
sign
because
once
this
is
recognized
it
gives
the
team
at
the
bat
a
great
advantage
if
a
coacher
sees
the
catcher
give
the
pitchout
signal
he
can
stop
the
runner
from
trying
to
steal
and
the
pitcher
has
wasted
a
ball
and
is
in
the
hole
then
if
his
control
is
uncertain
the
result
is
likely
to
be
disastrous
several
players
in
the
national
league
are
always
trying
to
get
the
batter
signs
bresnahan
the
manager
and
catcher
of
the
louis
club
devotes
half
his
time
and
energy
to
looking
for
the
wireless
code
employed
by
batter
and
base
runner
if
he
can
discover
the
hit
and
run
sign
then
he
is
able
to
order
a
pitchout
and
catch
the
man
who
has
started
to
run
in
response
to
it
several
feet
at
second
base
he
is
a
genius
at
getting
this
information
once
late
in
when
the
new
york
club
was
in
louis
on
the
last
trip
west
i
came
up
to
the
bat
with
fletcher
on
first
base
i
rubbed
the
end
of
my
stick
with
my
hand
and
roger
exclaimed
why
that
your
old
hit
and
run
matty
what
are
you
trying
to
do
kid
me
i
forgot
you
knew
it
rog
i
answered
but
it
goes
he
thought
i
was
attempting
to
cross
him
and
did
not
order
a
pitchout
the
sign
had
been
given
intentionally
i
hit
the
ball
and
had
the
laugh
on
him
if
a
catcher
can
get
a
pitchout
on
a
hit
and
run
sign
he
upsets
the
other
team
greatly
take
a
fast
man
on
first
base
and
the
batter
signs
him
that
he
is
going
to
hit
the
next
ball
the
runner
gets
his
start
and
the
ball
comes
up
so
wide
that
the
batter
could
not
half
reach
it
with
a
bat
the
runner
is
caught
easily
at
second
base
and
it
makes
him
look
foolish
that
is
why
so
many
catchers
devote
time
to
looking
for
this
signal
it
is
a
great
fruit
bearer
many
of
the
extra
players
on
the
bench
are
always
on
the
alert
for
the
hit
and
run
sign
this
is
a
typical
situation
the
giants
were
playing
the
pittsburg
club
one
day
in
byrne
was
on
first
base
fred
clarke
was
at
bat
and
byrne
started
for
second
while
clarke
hit
the
ball
to
right
field
byrne
reaching
third
base
on
the
play
what
did
he
do
asked
ames
did
you
get
it
matty
inquired
wiltse
no
i
answered
did
you
i
think
he
tapped
his
bat
on
the
plate
replied
wiltse
the
next
time
clarke
came
up
we
were
all
looking
to
see
if
he
tapped
his
bat
on
the
plate
byrne
was
again
on
first
base
the
pirates
manager
fixed
his
cap
he
stepped
back
out
of
the
box
and
knocked
the
dirt
out
of
his
cleats
and
he
did
two
or
three
other
natural
things
before
the
pitch
but
nothing
happened
then
he
tapped
his
bat
on
the
plate
make
him
put
them
over
chief
yelled
wiltse
which
translated
meant
order
a
chief
he
just
gave
byrne
the
hit
and
run
sign
meyers
signed
for
a
pitchout
and
byrne
was
caught
ten
feet
from
second
wiltse
on
the
bench
had
really
nailed
the
base
runner
as
soon
as
a
sign
is
discovered
it
is
communicated
to
the
other
players
and
they
are
always
watching
for
it
but
try
to
conceal
the
fact
that
they
recognize
it
because
as
soon
as
a
batter
discovers
that
his
messages
are
being
read
he
changes
his
code
from
these
few
facts
about
signals
and
sign
stealing
some
idea
of
the
battle
of
wits
that
is
going
on
between
two
ball
clubs
in
a
game
may
be
obtained
that
is
why
so
few
men
without
brains
last
in
the
big
leagues
nowadays
a
young
fellow
broke
in
with
the
giants
a
few
years
ago
and
was
very
anxious
to
make
good
he
was
playing
shortstop
watch
for
the
catcher
signs
and
then
shift
mcgraw
told
him
one
day
it
is
well
known
in
baseball
that
a
hitter
will
naturally
push
a
curve
over
the
outside
corner
of
the
plate
toward
right
field
and
over
the
inside
he
will
pull
it
around
toward
third
base
but
this
youngster
was
overanxious
and
would
shift
before
the
pitcher
started
to
deliver
the
ball
some
smart
player
on
another
club
noticed
this
and
tipped
the
batters
off
to
watch
the
youngster
for
the
signs
when
he
shifted
toward
second
base
the
batter
set
himself
for
a
ball
over
the
outside
corner
for
a
long
time
mcgraw
could
not
understand
how
the
other
teams
were
getting
the
giants
signs
especially
as
it
was
on
our
home
grounds
at
last
he
saw
the
new
infielder
shift
one
day
and
the
batter
prepare
for
an
inside
ball
say
he
said
to
the
player
rushing
on
the
field
after
he
had
stopped
the
pitcher
do
you
know
you
are
telegraphing
the
signs
to
the
batters
by
moving
around
before
the
pitcher
throws
the
ball
bill
dahlen
formerly
a
shortstop
on
the
giants
used
to
shift
but
he
was
clever
enough
to
wait
until
the
pitcher
had
started
his
motion
when
it
was
too
late
for
the
batter
to
look
at
him
are
always
looking
to
steal
some
sign
so
that
they
may
cross
the
enemy
in
the
language
of
the
big
leagues
it
is
signs
never
signals
and
in
conclusion
i
reiterate
my
former
sentiments
that
all
is
fair
in
love
war
and
baseball
except
stealing
signs
dishonestly
viii
umpires
and
close
decisions
and
umpires
are
regarded
by
the
fans
as
natural
enemies
and
the
fans
are
about
right
types
of
arbiters
and
how
the
players
treat
them
silk
hank
tim
hurst
bob
emslie
and
others
and
close
ones
they
have
called
also
some
narrow
escapes
which
have
when
the
giants
were
swinging
through
the
west
in
on
the
final
trip
the
club
played
three
games
in
pittsburg
with
the
pennant
at
that
time
only
a
possibility
more
or
less
remote
the
pirates
still
had
a
chance
and
they
were
fighting
hard
for
every
game
especially
as
they
were
playing
on
their
home
grounds
the
first
contest
of
the
series
was
on
saturday
afternoon
before
a
crowd
that
packed
the
gigantic
stands
which
surrounded
forbes
field
the
throng
wanted
to
see
the
pirates
win
because
they
were
the
pirates
and
the
giants
beaten
because
they
were
the
giants
and
were
sticking
their
heads
up
above
the
other
clubs
in
the
race
i
always
think
of
the
horse
show
when
i
play
in
pittsburg
for
they
have
the
diamond
of
boxes
there
you
know
no
i
wrong
it
at
the
metropolitan
opera
house
they
have
the
diamond
any
way
the
diamond
of
boxes
was
doing
business
at
forbes
field
that
saturday
afternoon
this
story
is
going
to
be
about
umpires
but
the
reader
who
has
never
seen
the
forbes
field
folks
must
get
the
atmosphere
before
i
let
the
yarn
into
the
block
once
on
a
bright
sunny
day
there
i
muffed
fly
after
fly
because
the
glint
of
sol
rays
on
the
diamonds
blinded
me
always
now
i
wear
smoked
glasses
josh
devore
is
so
afraid
that
he
will
lose
social
caste
when
he
goes
to
pittsburg
that
he
gets
his
manicured
before
he
will
appear
on
the
field
and
the
lady
who
treated
him
one
day
polished
them
to
such
an
ultimate
glossiness
that
the
sun
flashed
on
them
and
he
dropped
two
flies
in
left
field
look
here
josh
warned
mcgraw
after
the
game
i
hire
you
to
play
ball
and
not
to
lead
cotillions
get
some
pumice
stone
and
rub
it
on
your
and
cut
out
those
john
drew
manicures
after
this
this
crowd
is
worse
after
umpires
than
the
residents
of
the
bleachers
the
game
on
that
saturday
worked
out
into
a
pitchers
battle
between
marty
the
expensive
exponent
of
the
spit
ball
and
rube
marquard
the
great
half
of
who
who
in
pittsburg
had
already
split
white
gloves
applauding
when
along
about
the
fourth
or
fifth
inning
fred
clarke
got
as
far
as
third
base
with
one
out
the
score
was
nothing
for
either
side
as
yet
and
of
such
a
delicate
nature
was
the
contest
that
one
run
was
likely
to
decide
it
hans
wagner
the
peerless
and
the
pride
of
pittsburg
was
at
the
bat
he
pushed
a
long
fly
to
murray
in
right
field
and
john
caught
it
and
threw
the
ball
home
clarke
and
the
ball
arrived
almost
simultaneously
there
was
a
slide
a
jumble
of
players
and
a
small
cloud
of
dust
blew
away
from
the
home
plate
ye
out
bawled
brennan
the
umpire
jerking
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
with
a
conclusiveness
that
forbade
argument
clarke
jumped
up
and
stretched
his
hands
four
feet
apart
for
he
recognizes
no
conclusiveness
when
one
is
called
against
him
safe
that
much
he
shouted
in
brennan
ear
showing
him
the
margin
with
his
hands
there
was
a
roar
from
the
diamond
that
if
it
could
have
been
canned
and
put
on
a
phonograph
would
have
made
any
one
his
fortune
because
it
could
have
been
turned
on
to
accompany
moving
pictures
of
lions
and
other
wild
beasts
to
make
them
realistic
say
said
clarke
to
brennan
i
know
a
pickpocket
who
looks
honest
compared
to
you
and
i
rather
trust
my
watch
to
a
worker
brennan
was
dusting
off
the
plate
and
paid
no
attention
to
him
but
clarke
continued
to
snap
and
bark
at
the
umpire
as
he
brushed
himself
off
referring
with
feeling
to
brennan
immediate
family
and
weaving
into
his
talk
a
sketch
of
the
umpire
ancestors
for
clarke
is
a
great
master
of
the
english
language
as
fed
to
umpires
clarke
said
brennan
turning
at
last
you
were
out
now
beat
it
to
the
bench
before
you
beat
it
to
the
clubhouse
clarke
went
grumbling
and
all
the
afternoon
was
after
brennan
for
the
decision
his
wrath
increasing
because
the
pirates
lost
the
game
finally
although
they
would
not
have
won
it
had
they
been
given
that
decision
and
the
crowd
was
roaring
at
brennan
too
throughout
the
remainder
of
the
contest
asking
him
pointed
questions
about
his
habits
and
what
his
regular
business
was
it
takes
a
man
with
nerve
to
make
a
decision
like
that
one
that
could
be
called
either
way
because
it
was
so
close
and
to
make
it
as
he
sees
it
which
happened
in
this
particular
case
to
be
against
the
home
team
many
times
have
i
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
protested
against
the
decision
of
an
umpire
but
fundamentally
i
know
that
the
umpires
are
honest
and
are
doing
their
best
as
all
are
the
umpires
make
mistakes
and
the
players
make
errors
many
arbiters
have
told
me
that
when
they
are
working
they
seldom
know
what
inning
it
is
or
how
many
are
out
and
sometimes
in
their
efforts
to
concentrate
their
minds
on
their
decisions
they
say
they
even
forget
what
clubs
are
playing
and
which
is
the
home
team
the
future
of
the
game
depends
on
the
umpire
for
his
honesty
must
not
be
questioned
if
there
is
a
breath
of
suspicion
against
a
man
he
is
immediately
let
go
because
constant
repetition
of
such
a
charge
would
result
in
baseball
going
the
way
of
horse
racing
and
some
other
sports
no
scandal
can
creep
in
where
the
umpire
is
concerned
for
the
very
popularity
of
baseball
depends
on
its
honesty
the
only
good
umpire
is
a
dead
umpire
mcgraw
has
declared
many
times
when
he
has
been
disgruntled
over
some
decision
i
think
they
all
dead
ones
in
this
league
replied
devore
one
day
considering
the
decisions
that
they
are
handing
me
down
there
at
second
base
why
i
had
that
bag
by
three
feet
and
he
called
me
out
many
baseball
fans
look
upon
an
umpire
as
a
sort
of
necessary
evil
to
the
luxury
of
baseball
like
the
odor
that
follows
an
automobile
kill
him
he
has
got
any
friends
is
an
expression
shouted
from
the
stands
time
and
again
during
a
game
but
i
know
differently
i
have
seen
umpires
with
friends
it
is
true
that
most
regard
umpires
as
their
natural
enemies
as
a
boy
does
a
school
teacher
but
bill
klem
has
friends
because
i
have
seen
him
with
them
and
besides
he
has
a
constant
companion
which
is
a
calabash
pipe
and
billy
evans
of
the
american
league
has
lots
of
friends
and
most
all
of
the
umpires
have
some
one
who
will
speak
to
them
when
they
are
off
the
field
these
men
in
blue
travel
by
themselves
live
at
obscure
hotels
apart
from
those
at
which
the
teams
stop
and
slip
into
the
ball
parks
unobtrusively
just
before
game
time
they
never
make
friends
with
off
the
field
for
fear
that
there
might
be
a
hint
of
scandal
seldom
do
they
take
the
same
train
with
a
club
unless
it
can
not
be
avoided
hank
the
veteran
of
the
national
league
staff
and
brennan
took
the
same
train
out
of
chicago
with
the
giants
in
the
fall
of
because
we
stopped
in
pittsburg
for
one
game
and
they
had
to
be
there
to
umpire
it
was
the
only
available
means
of
transportation
but
they
stayed
by
themselves
in
another
pullman
until
some
one
told
them
charley
faust
the
official
of
the
giants
was
doing
his
stunt
then
they
both
came
back
into
the
giants
car
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
saw
hank
laugh
his
face
acted
as
if
it
was
accustomed
to
the
exercise
and
broke
all
in
funny
new
wrinkles
like
a
glove
when
you
put
it
on
for
the
first
time
there
are
several
types
of
umpires
and
are
always
studying
the
species
to
find
out
the
best
way
to
treat
each
man
to
get
the
most
out
of
him
there
are
autocrats
and
stubborn
ones
and
good
fellows
and
ones
almost
as
many
kinds
as
there
are
human
beings
the
autocrat
of
the
umpire
world
is
silk
now
appearing
with
a
rival
show
there
are
no
close
plays
says
silk
a
man
is
always
out
or
safe
or
it
is
a
ball
or
a
strike
and
the
umpire
if
he
is
a
good
man
and
knows
his
business
is
always
right
for
instance
i
am
always
right
he
refuses
to
let
the
players
discuss
a
decision
with
him
maintaining
that
there
is
never
any
room
for
argument
if
a
man
makes
any
talk
with
him
it
is
quick
to
the
shower
bath
silk
has
a
voice
of
which
he
is
proud
and
declares
that
he
shares
the
honors
with
caruso
and
that
it
is
only
his
profession
as
an
umpire
that
keeps
him
off
the
circuit
i
have
heard
a
lot
of
american
league
say
at
various
times
that
they
wished
he
was
on
the
circuit
or
some
more
calorific
circuit
but
they
were
mostly
prejudiced
at
those
moments
by
some
sentiments
which
silk
had
just
voiced
in
an
official
capacity
as
is
well
known
in
baseball
silk
is
the
inventor
of
strike
tuh
and
the
creased
trousers
for
umpires
i
have
heard
american
league
players
declare
that
they
are
afraid
to
slide
when
silk
is
close
down
over
a
play
for
fear
they
will
bump
up
against
his
trousers
and
cut
themselves
he
is
one
of
the
kind
of
umpires
who
can
go
through
a
game
on
the
hottest
summer
day
running
about
the
bases
and
still
keep
his
collar
unwilted
at
the
end
he
will
look
as
if
he
were
dressed
for
an
afternoon
tea
always
he
wears
on
his
right
hand
which
is
his
salary
or
decision
wing
a
large
diamond
that
sparkles
in
the
sunlight
every
time
he
calls
a
man
out
many
american
league
players
assert
that
he
would
rather
call
a
man
out
than
safe
so
that
he
can
shimmer
his
cracked
ice
but
again
they
are
usually
influenced
by
circumstances
such
is
silk
well
named
corresponding
to
him
in
the
national
league
is
billy
klem
he
always
wears
a
norfolk
jacket
because
he
thinks
it
more
stylish
and
perhaps
it
is
and
he
refuses
to
don
a
wind
pad
ever
notice
him
working
behind
the
bat
but
i
am
going
to
let
you
in
on
a
secret
that
chest
is
not
all
his
own
beneath
his
jacket
he
carries
his
armor
a
protector
and
under
his
trousers
legs
are
shin
guards
he
insists
that
all
players
call
him
he
says
that
he
thinks
maybe
soon
his
name
will
be
in
the
social
register
larry
doyle
thought
that
he
had
received
the
raw
end
of
a
decision
at
second
base
one
day
he
ran
down
to
first
where
klem
had
retreated
after
he
passed
his
judgment
say
exploded
larry
that
man
did
touch
the
bag
come
within
six
feet
of
it
say
doyle
replied
klem
when
you
talk
to
me
call
me
klem
but
klem
amended
larry
klem
hurriedly
drew
a
line
with
his
foot
as
doyle
approached
him
menacingly
but
if
you
come
over
that
line
you
out
of
the
game
doyle
he
threatened
all
right
answered
larry
letting
his
pugilistic
attitude
evaporate
before
the
abruptness
of
klem
as
the
mist
does
before
the
classic
noonday
sun
but
klem
i
only
wanted
to
ask
you
if
that
clock
in
centre
field
is
right
by
your
watch
because
i
know
everything
about
you
is
right
larry
went
back
grinning
and
considering
that
he
had
put
one
over
on
klem
klem
for
a
long
time
johnny
evers
of
the
chicago
club
declared
that
klem
owed
him
on
a
bet
he
had
lost
to
the
second
baseman
and
had
neglected
to
pay
now
john
when
he
was
right
could
make
almost
any
umpirical
goat
leap
from
crag
to
crag
and
do
somersaults
en
route
he
kept
pestering
klem
about
that
measly
bet
not
in
an
obtrusive
way
you
understand
but
by
such
delicate
methods
as
holding
up
five
fingers
when
klem
glanced
down
on
the
coaching
lines
where
he
was
stationed
or
by
writing
a
large
in
the
dirt
at
the
home
plate
with
the
butt
of
his
bat
as
he
came
up
when
klem
was
umpiring
on
balls
and
strikes
or
by
counting
slowly
and
casually
up
to
five
and
stopping
with
an
abruptness
that
could
not
be
misconstrued
one
day
john
let
his
temper
get
away
from
him
and
bawled
klem
out
in
his
most
approved
fashion
here
your
five
evers
said
klem
handing
him
a
five
dollar
bill
and
now
you
are
fined
and
it
was
worth
it
answered
evers
to
bawl
you
out
next
comes
the
type
and
there
is
only
one
of
them
hank
he
is
the
stubborn
kind
or
perhaps
the
stubborn
kind
would
be
better
as
he
is
now
a
manager
he
is
if
a
manager
gets
after
him
for
a
decision
he
is
likely
to
go
up
in
the
air
and
not
meaning
to
do
it
call
close
ones
against
the
club
that
has
made
the
kick
for
it
must
be
remembered
that
umpires
are
only
poor
weak
mortals
after
all
has
to
be
handled
with
shock
absorbers
mcgraw
tries
to
do
it
but
shock
absorbers
do
not
fit
him
well
and
the
first
thing
that
usually
occurs
is
a
row
let
me
do
the
kicking
boys
mcgraw
always
warns
his
players
before
a
contest
that
is
going
to
umpire
he
does
not
want
to
see
any
of
his
men
put
out
of
the
game
bill
dahlen
always
got
on
nerves
by
calling
him
henry
for
some
reason
does
not
like
the
name
and
bill
dahlen
discovered
long
ago
the
most
irritating
inflection
to
give
it
so
that
it
would
rasp
on
ears
he
does
not
mind
hank
and
is
not
a
mister
umpire
but
every
time
dahlen
would
call
henry
it
was
the
cold
shower
and
the
civilian
clothes
for
his
dahlen
was
playing
in
louis
many
years
ago
when
the
race
track
was
right
opposite
the
ball
park
bill
had
a
preference
in
one
of
the
later
races
one
day
and
was
anxious
to
get
across
the
street
and
make
a
little
bet
he
had
obtained
a
leave
of
absence
on
two
preceding
days
by
calling
henry
and
had
lost
money
on
the
horses
he
had
selected
as
fleet
of
foot
but
this
last
time
he
had
a
sure
thing
and
was
banking
on
some
positive
information
which
had
been
slipped
to
him
by
a
friend
of
the
friend
of
the
man
who
owned
the
winner
and
bill
wanted
to
be
there
along
about
the
fifth
inning
bill
figured
that
it
was
time
for
him
to
get
a
start
so
he
walked
up
to
and
said
henry
do
you
know
who
won
the
first
race
no
and
you
wo
either
dahlen
answered
hank
you
are
fined
and
you
stay
here
and
play
the
game
out
some
one
had
tipped
hank
off
and
the
saddest
part
of
the
story
is
that
bill
horse
walked
home
and
he
could
not
get
a
bet
down
on
him
first
time
it
ever
failed
to
work
groaned
bill
in
the
hotel
that
night
and
i
said
in
my
meanest
way
too
most
clubs
try
to
keep
an
umpire
from
feeling
hostile
toward
the
team
because
even
if
he
means
to
see
a
play
right
he
is
likely
to
call
a
close
one
against
his
enemies
not
intending
to
be
dishonest
it
would
simply
mean
that
you
would
not
get
any
close
ones
from
him
and
the
close
ones
count
some
umpires
can
be
reasoned
with
and
a
good
fair
protest
will
often
make
a
man
think
perhaps
he
has
called
it
wrong
and
he
will
give
you
the
edge
on
the
next
decision
a
player
must
understand
an
umpire
to
know
how
to
approach
him
to
the
best
advantage
can
not
be
reasoned
with
it
is
as
dangerous
to
argue
with
him
as
it
is
to
try
to
ascertain
how
much
gasoline
is
in
the
tank
of
an
automobile
by
sticking
down
the
lighted
end
of
a
cigar
or
a
cigarette
emslie
will
listen
to
a
reasonable
argument
he
is
one
of
the
finest
umpires
that
ever
broke
into
the
league
i
think
he
is
a
good
fellow
far
be
it
from
me
to
be
disloyal
to
my
manager
for
i
think
that
he
is
the
greatest
that
ever
won
a
pennant
but
emslie
put
one
over
on
mcgraw
in
when
it
was
being
said
that
emslie
was
getting
so
old
he
could
not
see
a
play
i
bet
said
mcgraw
to
him
one
day
after
he
had
called
one
against
the
giants
that
i
can
put
a
baseball
and
an
orange
on
second
base
and
you
ca
tell
the
difference
standing
at
the
home
plate
bob
emslie
made
no
reply
right
then
but
when
the
eye
test
for
umpires
was
established
by
lynch
the
president
of
the
league
bob
passed
it
at
the
head
of
the
list
and
then
turned
around
and
went
up
to
chatham
in
ontario
canada
and
made
a
high
score
with
the
rifle
in
a
shooting
match
up
there
after
he
had
done
that
he
was
umpiring
at
the
polo
grounds
one
day
want
to
take
me
on
for
a
shooting
go
john
he
asked
mcgraw
as
he
passed
him
no
bob
you
all
right
i
give
it
to
you
answered
mcgraw
who
had
long
forgotten
his
slur
on
emslie
eyesight
emslie
is
the
sort
of
umpire
who
rules
by
the
bond
of
good
fellowship
rather
than
by
the
voice
of
authority
old
bob
has
one
groove
and
it
is
a
personal
matter
about
which
he
is
very
sensitive
he
is
under
cover
it
is
no
secret
or
i
would
not
give
way
on
him
but
that
luxuriant
growth
of
hair
apparent
comes
off
at
night
like
his
collar
and
necktie
it
used
to
be
quite
the
fad
in
the
league
to
josh
bob
about
his
wig
but
that
pastime
has
sort
of
died
out
now
because
he
has
proven
himself
to
be
such
a
good
fellow
i
had
to
laugh
to
myself
and
not
boisterously
in
the
season
of
when
lynch
appointed
jack
doyle
formerly
a
first
baseman
and
a
player
an
umpire
and
scheduled
him
to
work
with
emslie
i
remembered
the
time
several
seasons
ago
when
doyle
took
offence
at
one
of
bob
decisions
and
wrestled
him
all
over
the
infield
trying
to
get
his
wig
off
and
show
him
up
before
the
crowd
and
then
emslie
and
he
worked
together
like
damon
and
pythias
this
business
makes
strange
emslie
was
umpiring
in
new
york
one
day
in
the
season
of
when
the
giants
were
playing
louis
a
wild
pitch
hit
emslie
over
the
heart
and
he
wilted
down
unconscious
the
players
gathered
around
him
and
bresnahan
who
was
catching
for
louis
at
the
time
started
to
help
bob
suddenly
the
old
umpire
came
to
and
began
to
fight
off
his
corps
no
one
could
understand
his
attitude
as
he
struggled
to
his
feet
and
strolled
away
by
himself
staggering
a
little
and
apparently
dizzy
at
last
he
came
back
and
gamely
finished
the
business
of
the
day
i
never
knew
why
he
fought
with
the
men
who
were
trying
to
help
him
until
several
weeks
later
when
we
were
playing
in
pittsburg
as
i
came
out
from
under
the
stand
on
my
way
to
the
bench
emslie
happened
to
be
making
his
entrance
at
the
same
time
say
matty
he
asked
me
that
time
in
new
york
did
my
wig
come
off
did
bresnahan
take
my
wig
off
no
bob
i
replied
he
was
only
trying
to
help
you
i
thought
maybe
he
took
it
off
while
i
was
down
and
out
and
showed
me
up
before
the
crowd
he
apologized
listen
bob
i
said
i
do
believe
there
is
a
player
in
either
league
who
would
do
that
and
if
any
youngster
tried
it
now
he
would
probably
be
licked
i
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
matty
answered
the
old
man
as
he
picked
up
his
wind
pad
and
prepared
to
go
to
work
and
he
called
more
bad
ones
on
me
that
day
than
he
ever
had
in
his
life
before
but
i
never
mentioned
the
wig
to
him
most
umpires
declare
they
have
off
days
just
like
players
when
they
know
that
they
are
making
mistakes
and
can
not
help
it
if
a
pitcher
of
mordecai
brown
kind
who
depends
largely
on
his
control
for
his
effectiveness
happens
to
run
up
against
an
umpire
with
a
bad
day
he
might
just
as
well
go
back
to
the
bench
brown
is
a
great
man
to
work
the
corners
of
the
plate
and
if
the
umpire
is
missing
strikes
he
is
forced
to
lay
the
ball
over
and
then
the
batters
whang
it
out
johnstone
had
an
off
day
in
chicago
in
when
brown
was
working
what
the
use
of
my
tryin
to
pitch
jim
said
brown
throwing
down
his
glove
and
walking
to
the
bench
disgusted
if
you
do
know
a
strike
when
you
see
one
sometimes
an
umpire
who
has
been
good
will
go
into
a
long
slump
when
he
can
not
call
things
right
and
knows
it
men
like
that
get
as
discouraged
as
a
pitcher
who
goes
bad
there
used
to
be
one
in
the
national
league
who
was
a
pretty
fair
umpire
when
he
started
and
seemed
to
be
getting
along
fine
until
he
hit
one
of
those
slumps
then
he
began
calling
everything
wrong
and
knew
it
at
last
he
quit
and
the
next
time
i
saw
him
was
in
philadelphia
in
the
world
series
he
was
a
policeman
hello
matty
he
shouted
at
me
as
we
were
going
into
shibe
park
for
the
first
game
there
i
can
call
you
by
your
first
name
now
and
he
waved
his
hand
real
friendly
the
last
conversation
i
had
with
that
fellow
unless
my
recollection
fails
me
entirely
was
anything
but
friendly
umpires
have
told
me
that
sometimes
they
see
a
play
one
way
and
call
it
another
and
as
soon
as
the
decision
is
announced
they
realize
that
they
have
called
it
wrong
this
malady
has
put
more
than
one
umpire
out
a
man
on
the
national
league
staff
has
informed
me
since
that
he
called
a
hit
fair
that
was
palpably
two
feet
foul
in
one
of
the
most
important
games
ever
played
in
baseball
when
he
saw
the
ball
strike
on
foul
ground
i
could
help
saying
ball
declared
this
man
and
he
is
one
of
the
best
in
the
national
league
luckily
he
added
the
team
against
which
the
decision
went
won
the
game
many
players
assert
that
arbiters
hold
a
personal
grudge
against
certain
men
who
have
put
up
too
strenuous
kicks
and
for
that
reason
the
wise
ones
are
careful
how
they
talk
to
umpires
of
this
sort
fred
tenney
has
said
for
a
long
time
that
klem
gives
him
a
shade
the
worst
of
it
on
all
close
ones
because
he
had
a
run
in
with
that
umpire
one
day
when
they
came
to
blows
tenney
is
a
great
man
to
pick
out
the
good
ones
when
at
the
bat
and
fred
says
that
if
he
is
up
with
a
three
and
two
count
on
him
now
klem
is
likely
to
call
the
next
one
a
strike
if
it
is
close
not
because
he
is
dishonest
but
because
he
has
a
certain
personal
prejudice
which
he
can
not
overcome
and
the
funny
part
about
it
is
that
tenney
does
not
hold
this
up
against
klem
humorous
incidents
are
always
occurring
in
connection
with
umpires
we
were
playing
in
boston
one
day
a
few
years
ago
and
the
score
was
to
against
the
giants
in
the
ninth
inning
becker
knocked
a
home
run
with
two
men
on
the
bases
and
it
tied
the
count
with
men
on
first
and
third
bases
and
one
out
in
the
last
half
of
the
ninth
a
boston
batter
tapped
one
to
merkle
which
i
thought
he
trapped
but
johnstone
the
umpire
said
he
caught
it
on
the
fly
it
was
simplicity
itself
to
double
the
runner
up
off
first
base
who
also
thought
merkle
had
trapped
the
ball
and
had
started
for
second
that
retired
the
side
and
we
won
the
game
in
the
twelfth
inning
whereas
boston
would
have
taken
it
in
the
ninth
if
johnstone
had
said
the
ball
was
trapped
instead
of
caught
on
the
fly
it
was
a
very
hot
day
and
those
extra
three
innings
in
the
box
knocked
me
out
i
was
sick
for
a
week
with
stomach
trouble
afterwards
and
could
not
pitch
in
chicago
where
we
made
our
next
stop
that
was
a
case
of
where
a
decision
in
my
favor
made
me
sick
tim
hurst
the
old
american
league
umpire
was
one
of
the
most
picturesque
judges
that
ever
spun
an
indicator
he
was
the
sort
who
would
take
a
player
at
his
word
and
fight
him
blow
for
blow
tim
was
umpiring
in
baltimore
in
the
old
days
when
there
was
a
runner
on
first
base
the
man
started
to
steal
says
tim
he
was
telling
the
story
only
the
other
day
in
mcgraw
billiard
room
in
new
york
and
it
is
better
every
time
he
does
it
as
he
left
the
bag
he
spiked
the
first
baseman
and
that
player
attempted
to
trip
him
the
second
baseman
blocked
the
runner
and
in
sliding
into
the
bag
the
latter
tried
to
spike
jennings
who
was
playing
shortstop
and
covering
while
jennings
sat
on
him
to
knock
the
wind
out
the
batter
hit
robinson
who
was
catching
on
the
hands
with
his
bat
so
that
he
could
throw
and
trod
on
my
toes
with
his
spikes
and
shoved
his
glove
into
my
face
so
that
i
could
see
to
give
the
decision
it
was
one
of
the
hardest
that
i
have
ever
been
called
upon
to
make
what
did
you
do
i
asked
him
i
punched
in
the
ribs
called
it
a
foul
and
sent
the
runner
back
replied
tim
ix
the
game
that
cost
a
pennant
championship
of
the
national
league
was
decided
in
in
one
game
between
the
giants
and
cubs
few
fans
know
that
it
was
brush
who
induced
the
disgruntled
new
york
players
to
meet
chicago
this
is
the
inside
story
of
the
famous
game
including
fred
merkle
part
in
the
series
of
events
which
led
up
to
the
new
york
giants
and
the
chicago
cubs
played
a
game
at
the
polo
grounds
on
october
which
decided
the
championship
of
the
national
league
in
one
afternoon
which
was
responsible
for
the
deaths
of
two
spectators
who
fell
from
the
elevated
railroad
structure
overlooking
the
grounds
which
made
fred
merkle
famous
for
not
touching
second
which
caused
lifelong
friends
to
become
bitter
enemies
and
which
altogether
was
the
most
dramatic
and
important
contest
in
the
history
of
baseball
it
stands
out
from
events
like
the
battle
of
waterloo
and
the
assassination
of
president
lincoln
it
was
a
baseball
tragedy
from
a
new
york
point
of
view
the
cubs
won
by
the
score
of
to
behind
this
game
is
some
inside
history
that
has
never
been
written
few
persons
outside
of
the
members
of
the
new
york
club
know
that
it
was
only
after
a
great
deal
of
consultation
the
game
was
finally
played
only
after
the
urging
of
john
brush
the
president
of
the
club
the
giants
were
risking
in
one
afternoon
their
chances
of
winning
the
pennant
and
the
world
series
the
concentration
of
their
hopes
of
a
season
because
the
cubs
claimed
the
right
on
a
technicality
to
play
this
one
game
for
the
championship
many
members
of
the
new
york
club
felt
that
it
would
be
fighting
for
what
they
had
already
won
as
did
their
supporters
this
made
bad
feeling
between
the
teams
and
between
the
spectators
until
the
whole
dramatic
situation
leading
up
to
the
famous
game
culminated
in
the
climax
of
that
afternoon
the
nerves
of
the
players
were
rasped
raw
with
the
strain
and
the
town
wore
a
fringe
of
nervous
prostration
it
all
burst
forth
in
the
game
among
other
things
frank
chance
the
manager
of
the
cubs
had
a
cartilage
in
his
neck
broken
when
some
rooter
hit
him
with
a
handy
pop
bottle
several
spectators
hurt
one
another
when
they
switched
from
conversational
to
fistic
arguments
large
portions
of
the
fence
at
the
polo
grounds
were
broken
down
by
patrons
who
insisted
on
gaining
entrance
and
most
of
the
police
of
new
york
were
present
to
keep
order
they
had
their
clubs
unlimbered
too
acting
more
as
if
on
strike
duty
than
restraining
the
spectators
at
a
pleasure
park
last
of
all
that
night
after
we
had
lost
the
game
the
report
filtered
through
new
york
that
fred
merkle
then
a
youngster
and
around
whom
the
whole
situation
revolved
had
committed
suicide
of
course
it
was
not
true
for
merkle
is
one
of
the
gamest
that
ever
lived
my
part
in
the
game
was
small
i
started
to
pitch
and
i
did
finish
the
cubs
beat
me
because
i
never
had
less
on
the
ball
in
my
life
what
i
understand
to
this
day
is
why
it
took
them
so
long
to
hit
me
frequently
it
has
been
said
that
cy
seymour
started
the
cubs
on
their
victorious
way
and
lost
the
game
because
he
misjudged
a
long
hit
jostled
to
centre
field
by
joe
tinker
at
the
beginning
of
the
third
inning
in
which
chapter
they
made
four
runs
the
hit
went
for
three
bases
seymour
playing
centre
field
had
a
bad
background
against
which
to
judge
fly
balls
that
afternoon
facing
the
shadows
of
the
towering
stand
with
the
uncertain
horizon
formed
by
persons
perched
on
the
roof
a
baseball
writer
has
said
that
when
tinker
came
to
the
bat
in
that
fatal
inning
i
turned
in
the
box
and
motioned
seymour
back
and
instead
of
obeying
instructions
he
crept
a
few
steps
closer
to
the
infield
i
do
recall
giving
any
advice
to
cy
as
he
knew
the
chicago
batters
as
well
as
i
did
and
how
to
play
for
them
tinker
with
his
long
bat
swung
on
a
ball
intended
to
be
a
low
curve
over
the
outside
corner
of
the
plate
but
it
failed
to
break
well
he
pushed
out
a
high
fly
to
centre
field
and
i
turned
with
the
ball
to
see
seymour
take
a
couple
of
steps
toward
the
diamond
evidently
thinking
it
would
drop
somewhere
behind
second
base
he
appeared
to
be
uncertain
in
his
judgment
of
the
hit
until
he
suddenly
turned
and
started
to
run
back
that
must
have
been
when
the
ball
cleared
the
roof
of
the
stand
and
was
visible
above
the
sky
line
he
ran
wildly
once
he
turned
and
then
ran
on
again
at
last
sticking
up
his
hands
and
having
the
ball
fall
just
beyond
them
he
chased
it
and
picked
it
up
but
tinker
had
reached
third
base
by
that
time
if
he
had
let
the
ball
roll
into
the
crowd
in
centre
field
the
cub
could
have
made
only
two
bases
on
the
hit
according
to
the
ground
rules
that
was
a
mistake
but
it
made
little
difference
in
the
end
all
the
players
both
the
cubs
and
the
giants
were
under
a
terrific
strain
that
day
and
seymour
in
his
anxiety
to
be
sure
to
catch
the
ball
misjudged
it
did
you
ever
stand
out
in
the
field
at
a
ball
park
with
thirty
thousand
crazy
shouting
fans
looking
at
you
and
watch
a
ball
climb
and
climb
into
the
air
and
have
to
make
up
your
mind
exactly
where
it
is
going
to
land
and
then
have
to
be
there
when
it
arrived
to
greet
it
realizing
all
the
time
that
if
you
are
not
there
you
are
going
to
be
everlastingly
roasted
it
is
no
cure
for
nervous
diseases
that
situation
probably
times
out
of
fifty
seymour
would
have
caught
the
fly
i
misjudged
that
ball
said
cy
to
me
in
the
clubhouse
after
the
game
i
take
the
blame
for
it
he
accepted
all
the
abuse
the
newspapers
handed
him
without
a
murmur
and
i
do
think
myself
that
it
was
more
than
an
incident
in
the
game
i
try
to
show
later
in
this
story
where
the
real
break
came
just
one
mistake
made
by
fred
merkle
resulted
in
this
game
several
newspaper
men
have
called
september
merkle
day
because
it
was
on
that
day
he
ran
to
the
clubhouse
from
first
base
instead
of
by
way
of
second
when
al
bridwell
whacked
out
the
hit
that
apparently
won
the
game
from
the
cubs
any
other
player
on
the
team
would
have
undoubtedly
done
the
same
thing
under
the
circumstances
as
the
custom
had
been
in
vogue
all
around
the
circuit
during
the
season
it
was
simply
fred
merkle
misfortune
to
have
been
on
first
base
at
the
critical
moment
the
situation
which
gave
rise
to
the
incident
is
well
known
to
every
follower
of
baseball
merkle
as
a
pinch
hitter
had
singled
with
two
out
in
the
ninth
inning
and
the
score
tied
sending
mccormick
from
first
base
to
third
al
bridwell
came
up
to
the
bat
and
smashed
a
single
to
centre
field
mccormick
crossed
the
plate
and
that
according
to
the
customs
of
the
league
ended
the
game
so
merkle
dug
for
the
clubhouse
evers
and
tinker
ran
through
the
crowd
which
had
flocked
on
the
field
and
got
the
ball
touching
second
and
claiming
that
merkle
had
been
forced
out
there
most
of
the
spectators
did
not
understand
the
play
as
merkle
was
under
the
shower
bath
when
the
alleged
was
made
but
they
started
after
hank
the
umpire
to
be
on
the
safe
side
he
made
a
speedy
departure
under
the
and
the
crowd
got
the
unassisted
finally
while
somewhere
near
coogan
bluff
he
called
merkle
out
and
the
score
a
tie
when
the
boys
heard
this
in
the
clubhouse
they
laughed
for
it
did
seem
like
a
situation
to
be
taken
seriously
but
it
turned
out
to
be
one
of
those
things
that
the
farther
it
goes
the
more
serious
it
becomes
connie
mack
the
manager
of
the
athletics
says
there
is
no
luck
in
big
league
baseball
in
a
schedule
of
one
hundred
and
games
the
lucky
and
unlucky
plays
break
about
even
except
in
the
matter
of
injuries
but
mack
theory
does
not
include
a
schedule
of
one
hundred
and
games
with
the
result
depending
on
the
one
hundred
and
chicago
had
a
lot
of
injured
athletes
early
in
the
season
of
and
the
giants
had
shot
out
ahead
in
the
race
in
grand
style
in
the
meantime
the
cubs
cripples
began
to
recuperate
and
that
lamentable
event
on
september
seemed
to
be
the
in
the
giants
fortunes
almost
within
a
week
afterwards
bresnahan
had
an
attack
of
sciatic
rheumatism
and
mike
donlin
was
limping
about
the
outfield
leading
a
great
case
of
charley
horse
tenney
was
bandaged
from
his
waist
down
and
should
have
been
wearing
crutches
instead
of
playing
first
base
on
a
big
league
club
doyle
was
badly
spiked
and
in
the
hospital
mcgraw
daily
greeting
to
his
athletes
when
he
came
to
the
park
was
how
are
the
cripples
any
more
to
add
to
the
list
of
identified
dead
merkle
moped
he
lost
flesh
and
time
after
time
begged
mcgraw
to
send
him
to
a
minor
league
or
to
turn
him
loose
altogether
it
was
your
fault
was
the
regular
response
of
the
manager
who
makes
it
a
habit
to
stand
by
his
men
we
played
on
with
the
cripples
many
costing
the
pitchers
extra
effort
and
mcgraw
not
daring
to
take
a
chance
on
losing
a
game
if
there
were
any
opportunity
to
win
it
he
could
not
rest
any
of
his
men
merkle
lost
weight
and
seldom
spoke
to
the
other
players
as
the
cubs
crept
up
on
us
day
after
day
and
more
men
were
hurt
he
felt
that
he
was
responsible
for
this
change
in
the
luck
of
the
club
none
of
the
players
felt
this
way
toward
him
and
many
tried
to
cheer
him
up
but
he
was
inconsolable
the
team
went
over
to
philadelphia
and
coveleski
the
pitcher
we
later
drove
out
of
the
league
beat
us
three
times
winning
the
last
game
by
the
scantiest
of
margins
the
result
of
that
series
left
us
three
to
play
with
boston
to
tie
the
cubs
if
they
won
from
pittsburg
the
next
day
sunday
if
the
pirates
had
taken
that
sunday
game
it
would
have
given
them
the
pennant
we
returned
to
new
york
on
saturday
night
very
much
downhearted
lose
me
i
the
jinx
merkle
begged
mcgraw
that
night
you
stick
replied
the
manager
while
we
had
been
losing
the
cubs
had
been
coming
fast
it
seemed
as
if
they
could
not
drop
a
game
at
last
cincinnati
beat
them
one
which
was
the
only
thing
that
made
the
famous
season
tie
possible
there
is
an
interesting
anecdote
connected
with
that
cincinnati
contest
which
goes
to
prove
the
honesty
of
baseball
two
of
the
closest
friends
in
the
game
are
hans
lobert
then
with
the
reds
and
overall
the
former
chicago
pitcher
it
looked
as
if
chicago
had
the
important
game
won
up
to
the
ninth
inning
when
lobert
came
to
the
bat
with
two
men
out
and
two
on
the
bases
here
he
had
a
chance
to
overcome
the
lead
of
one
run
which
the
cubs
had
gained
and
win
the
contest
for
the
home
club
but
he
would
beat
his
best
friend
and
maybe
put
the
cubs
out
of
the
running
for
the
pennant
lobert
had
two
balls
and
two
strikes
when
he
smashed
the
next
pitch
to
center
field
scoring
both
the
base
runners
the
hit
came
near
beating
the
cubs
out
of
the
championship
it
would
have
if
we
had
taken
one
of
those
close
games
against
philadelphia
lobert
was
over
his
hit
for
he
wanted
the
cubs
to
win
on
his
way
to
the
clubhouse
he
walked
with
overall
the
two
striding
side
by
side
like
a
couple
of
mourners
i
sorry
said
lobert
i
would
not
have
made
that
hit
for
my
year
salary
if
i
could
have
helped
it
that
all
right
returned
overall
it
all
part
of
the
game
next
came
the
famous
game
in
chicago
on
sunday
between
the
cubs
and
the
pittsburg
pirates
when
a
victory
for
the
latter
club
would
have
meant
the
pennant
and
the
big
game
would
never
have
been
played
ten
thousand
persons
crowded
into
the
polo
grounds
that
sunday
afternoon
and
watched
a
little
electric
score
board
which
showed
the
plays
as
made
in
chicago
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
heard
a
new
york
crowd
cheering
the
cubs
with
great
fervor
for
on
their
victory
hung
our
only
chances
of
ultimate
success
the
same
man
who
was
shouting
himself
hoarse
for
the
cubs
that
afternoon
was
for
taking
a
vote
on
the
desirability
of
poisoning
the
whole
chicago
team
on
the
following
thursday
even
the
new
york
players
were
rooting
for
the
cubs
the
chicago
team
at
last
won
the
game
when
clarke
was
called
out
at
third
base
on
a
close
play
late
in
the
contest
with
the
decision
the
last
chance
went
glimmering
the
giants
now
had
three
games
to
win
from
boston
on
monday
tuesday
and
wednesday
to
make
the
deciding
game
on
thursday
necessary
we
won
those
and
the
stage
was
cleared
for
the
big
number
the
national
commission
gave
the
new
york
club
the
option
of
playing
three
games
out
of
five
for
the
championship
or
risking
it
all
on
one
contest
as
more
than
half
of
the
club
was
tottering
on
the
brink
of
the
hospital
it
was
decided
that
all
hope
should
be
hung
on
one
game
by
this
time
merkle
had
lost
twenty
pounds
and
his
eyes
were
hollow
and
his
cheeks
sunken
the
newspapers
showed
him
no
mercy
and
the
fans
never
failed
to
criticise
and
hiss
him
when
he
appeared
on
the
field
he
stuck
to
it
and
showed
up
in
the
ball
park
every
day
putting
on
his
uniform
and
practising
it
was
a
game
thing
to
do
a
lot
of
men
under
the
same
fire
would
have
quit
cold
mcgraw
was
with
him
all
the
way
but
it
was
not
until
after
considerable
discussion
that
it
was
decided
to
play
that
game
all
the
men
felt
disgruntled
because
they
believed
they
would
be
playing
for
something
they
had
already
won
even
mcgraw
was
so
wrought
up
he
said
in
the
clubhouse
the
night
before
the
game
i
do
care
whether
you
fellows
play
this
game
or
not
you
can
take
a
vote
a
vote
was
taken
and
the
players
were
not
unanimous
some
protesting
it
ought
to
be
put
up
to
the
league
directors
so
that
if
they
wanted
to
rob
the
team
of
a
pennant
they
would
have
to
take
the
blame
others
insisted
it
would
look
like
quitting
and
it
was
finally
decided
to
appoint
a
committee
to
call
upon
brush
the
president
of
the
club
who
was
ill
in
bed
in
the
lambs
club
at
the
time
devlin
bresnahan
donlin
tenney
and
i
were
on
that
committee
brush
i
said
to
my
employer
having
been
appointed
the
spokesman
mcgraw
has
left
it
up
to
us
to
decide
whether
we
shall
meet
the
chicago
team
for
the
championship
of
the
national
league
a
lot
of
the
boys
do
not
believe
we
ought
to
be
forced
to
play
over
again
for
something
we
have
already
won
so
the
players
have
appointed
this
committee
of
five
to
consult
with
you
and
get
your
opinion
on
the
subject
what
we
decide
goes
with
them
brush
looked
surprised
i
was
nervous
more
so
than
when
i
am
in
the
box
with
three
on
the
bases
and
joe
tinker
at
the
bat
bresnahan
fumbled
with
his
hat
and
devlin
coughed
tenney
leaned
more
heavily
on
his
cane
and
donlin
blew
his
nose
we
five
big
athletes
were
embarrassed
in
the
presence
of
this
sick
man
suddenly
it
struck
us
all
at
the
same
time
that
the
game
would
have
to
be
played
to
keep
ourselves
square
with
our
own
ideas
of
courage
even
if
the
cubs
had
claimed
it
on
a
technicality
even
if
we
had
really
won
the
pennant
once
that
game
had
to
be
played
now
we
all
saw
that
and
it
was
this
thin
ill
man
in
bed
who
made
us
see
it
even
before
he
had
said
a
word
it
was
the
expression
on
his
face
it
seemed
to
say
and
i
had
confidence
in
you
boys
to
do
the
right
thing
i
going
to
leave
it
to
you
he
answered
you
boys
can
play
the
game
or
put
it
up
to
the
directors
of
the
league
to
decide
as
you
want
but
i
should
think
you
would
stop
now
after
making
all
this
fight
the
committee
called
an
executive
session
and
we
all
thought
of
the
crowd
of
fans
looking
forward
to
the
game
and
of
what
the
newspapers
would
say
if
we
refused
to
play
it
and
of
brush
lying
there
the
man
who
wanted
us
to
play
and
it
was
rapidly
and
unanimously
decided
to
imitate
steve
brodie
and
take
a
chance
we
play
i
said
to
brush
i
glad
he
answered
and
say
boys
he
added
as
we
started
to
file
out
i
want
to
tell
you
something
win
or
lose
i
going
to
give
the
players
a
bonus
of
that
night
was
a
wild
one
in
new
york
the
air
crackled
with
excitement
and
baseball
i
went
home
but
could
sleep
for
i
live
near
the
polo
grounds
and
the
crowd
began
to
gather
there
early
in
the
evening
of
the
day
before
the
game
to
be
ready
for
the
opening
of
the
gates
the
next
morning
they
tooted
horns
all
night
and
were
never
still
when
i
reported
at
the
ball
park
the
gates
had
been
closed
by
order
of
the
national
commission
but
the
streets
for
blocks
around
the
polo
grounds
were
jammed
with
persons
fighting
to
get
to
the
entrances
the
players
in
the
clubhouse
had
little
to
say
to
one
another
but
after
the
bandages
were
adjusted
mcgraw
called
his
men
around
him
and
said
chance
will
probably
pitch
pfiester
or
brown
if
pfiester
works
there
is
no
use
trying
to
steal
he
wo
give
you
any
lead
the
batters
ought
to
wait
him
out
and
the
hit
him
when
he
gets
in
a
hole
matty
is
going
to
pitch
for
us
pfiester
is
a
pitcher
who
watches
the
bases
closely
merkle
had
reported
at
the
clubhouse
as
usual
and
had
put
on
his
uniform
he
hung
on
the
edge
of
the
group
as
mcgraw
spoke
and
then
we
all
went
to
the
field
it
was
hard
for
us
to
play
that
game
with
the
crowd
which
was
there
but
harder
for
the
cubs
in
one
place
the
fence
was
broken
down
and
some
employees
were
playing
a
stream
of
water
from
a
fire
hose
on
the
cavity
to
keep
the
crowd
back
many
preferred
a
ducking
to
missing
the
game
and
ran
through
the
stream
to
the
lines
around
the
field
a
string
of
fans
recklessly
straddled
the
roof
of
the
old
every
once
in
a
while
some
group
would
break
through
the
restraining
ropes
and
scurry
across
the
diamond
to
what
appeared
to
be
a
better
point
of
vantage
this
would
let
a
throng
loose
which
hurried
one
way
and
another
and
mixed
in
with
the
players
more
police
had
to
be
summoned
as
i
watched
that
multitude
before
the
contest
i
could
think
of
three
or
four
things
i
would
rather
do
than
umpire
the
game
i
had
rested
my
arm
four
days
not
having
pitched
in
the
boston
series
and
i
felt
that
it
should
be
in
pretty
good
condition
before
that
respite
i
had
been
in
nine
out
of
fifteen
games
but
as
i
started
to
warm
up
the
ball
refused
to
break
i
could
get
anything
on
it
what
the
matter
rog
i
asked
bresnahan
they
wo
break
for
me
it
come
as
you
start
to
work
he
replied
although
i
could
see
that
he
too
was
worried
john
ward
the
old
and
now
one
of
the
owners
of
the
boston
national
league
club
has
told
me
since
that
after
working
almost
every
day
as
i
had
been
doing
it
does
a
pitcher
arm
no
good
to
lay
off
for
three
or
four
days
only
a
week
or
ten
days
will
accomplish
any
results
it
would
have
been
better
for
me
to
continue
to
work
as
often
as
i
had
been
doing
for
the
short
rest
only
seemed
to
deaden
my
arm
the
crowd
that
day
was
inflammable
the
players
caught
this
incendiary
spirit
mcginnity
batting
out
to
our
infield
in
practice
insisted
on
driving
chance
away
from
the
plate
before
the
cubs
leader
thought
his
team
had
had
its
full
share
of
the
batting
rehearsal
joe
shoved
him
a
little
and
in
a
minute
fists
were
flying
although
chance
and
mcginnity
are
very
good
friends
off
the
field
fights
immediately
started
all
around
in
the
stands
i
remember
seeing
two
men
roll
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
of
the
bleachers
over
the
heads
of
the
rest
of
the
spectators
and
they
were
yanked
to
their
feet
and
run
out
of
the
park
by
the
police
too
bad
i
said
to
bresnahan
nodding
my
head
toward
the
departing
belligerents
they
could
have
waited
until
they
saw
the
game
anyway
i
bet
they
stood
outside
the
park
all
night
to
get
in
only
to
be
run
out
before
it
started
i
forgot
the
crowd
forgot
the
fights
and
did
hear
the
howling
after
the
game
started
i
knew
only
one
thing
and
that
was
my
curved
ball
would
break
for
me
it
surprised
me
that
the
cubs
did
hit
it
far
right
away
but
two
of
them
fanned
in
the
first
inning
and
herzog
threw
out
evers
then
came
our
first
time
at
bat
pfiester
was
plainly
nervous
and
hit
tenney
herzog
walked
and
bresnahan
fanned
out
herzog
being
doubled
up
at
second
because
he
tried
to
advance
on
a
short
passed
ball
mike
donlin
whisked
a
double
to
right
field
and
tenney
counted
for
the
first
time
in
almost
a
month
merkle
smiled
he
was
drawn
up
in
the
corner
of
the
bench
pulling
away
from
the
rest
of
us
as
if
he
had
some
contagious
disease
and
was
quarantined
for
a
minute
it
looked
as
if
we
had
them
going
chance
yanked
pfiester
out
of
the
box
with
him
protesting
that
he
had
been
robbed
on
the
decisions
on
balls
and
strikes
brown
was
brought
into
the
game
and
fanned
devlin
that
ended
the
inning
we
never
had
a
chance
against
brown
his
curve
was
breaking
sharply
and
his
control
was
microscopic
we
went
back
to
the
field
in
the
second
with
that
one
run
lead
chance
made
the
first
hit
of
the
game
off
me
in
the
second
but
i
caught
him
sleeping
at
first
base
according
to
decision
there
was
a
kick
and
hofman
joining
in
the
chorus
of
protests
was
sent
to
the
clubhouse
tinker
started
the
third
with
that
memorable
triple
which
gave
the
cubs
their
chance
i
could
make
my
curve
break
i
did
have
anything
on
the
ball
rog
i
said
to
bresnahan
i
have
got
anything
keep
at
it
matty
he
replied
we
get
them
all
right
i
looked
in
at
the
bench
and
mcgraw
signalled
me
to
go
on
pitching
kling
singled
and
scored
tinker
brown
sacrificed
sending
kling
to
second
and
sheckard
flied
out
to
seymour
kling
being
held
on
second
base
i
lost
evers
because
i
was
afraid
to
put
the
ball
over
the
plate
for
him
and
he
walked
two
were
out
now
and
we
had
yet
a
chance
to
win
the
game
as
the
score
was
only
tied
but
schulte
doubled
and
kling
scored
leaving
men
on
second
and
third
bases
still
we
had
a
mongolian
chance
with
them
only
one
run
ahead
of
us
frank
chance
with
his
under
jaw
set
like
the
fender
on
a
trolley
car
caught
a
curved
ball
over
the
inside
corner
of
the
plate
and
pushed
it
to
right
field
for
two
bases
that
was
the
most
remarkable
batting
performance
i
have
ever
witnessed
since
i
have
been
in
the
big
leagues
a
hitter
naturally
slaps
a
ball
over
the
outside
edge
of
the
plate
to
right
field
but
chance
pushed
this
one
on
the
inside
with
the
handle
of
his
bat
just
over
tenney
hands
and
on
into
the
crowd
the
hit
scored
evers
and
schulte
and
dissolved
the
game
right
there
it
was
the
break
steinfeldt
fanned
none
of
the
players
spoke
to
one
another
as
they
went
to
the
bench
even
mcgraw
was
silent
we
knew
it
was
gone
merkle
was
drawn
up
behind
the
water
cooler
once
he
said
it
was
my
fault
boys
no
one
answered
him
inning
after
inning
our
batters
were
mowed
down
by
the
great
pitching
of
brown
who
was
never
better
his
control
of
his
curved
ball
was
marvellous
and
he
had
all
his
speed
as
the
innings
dragged
by
the
spectators
lost
heart
and
the
cowbells
ceased
to
jingle
and
the
cheering
lost
its
resonant
ring
it
was
now
a
surly
growl
then
the
seventh
we
had
our
one
glimmer
of
sunshine
devlin
started
with
a
single
to
centre
and
mccormick
shoved
a
drive
to
right
field
recalling
that
bridwell
was
more
or
less
of
a
pinch
hitter
brown
passed
him
purposely
and
doyle
was
sent
to
the
bat
in
my
place
as
he
hobbled
to
the
plate
on
his
weak
foot
said
mcgraw
hit
one
larry
the
crowd
broke
into
cheers
again
and
was
stamping
its
feet
the
bases
were
full
and
no
one
was
out
then
doyle
popped
up
a
weak
foul
behind
the
catcher
his
batting
eye
was
dim
and
rusty
through
long
disuse
kling
went
back
for
it
and
some
one
threw
a
pop
bottle
which
narrowly
missed
him
and
another
scaled
a
cushion
but
kling
kept
on
and
got
what
he
went
after
which
was
the
ball
he
has
a
habit
of
doing
that
tenney
flied
to
schulte
counting
devlin
on
the
catch
and
tinker
threw
out
herzog
the
game
was
gone
never
again
did
we
have
a
chance
it
was
a
glum
lot
of
players
in
the
clubhouse
merkle
came
up
to
mcgraw
and
said
mac
i
lost
you
one
pennant
fire
me
before
i
can
do
any
more
harm
fire
you
replied
mcgraw
we
ran
the
wrong
way
of
the
track
that
all
next
year
is
another
season
and
do
you
think
i
going
to
let
you
go
after
the
gameness
you
shown
through
all
this
abuse
why
the
kind
of
a
guy
i
been
lookin
for
many
years
i
could
use
a
carload
like
you
forget
this
season
and
come
around
next
spring
the
newspapers
will
have
forgotten
it
all
then
boys
and
he
slipped
out
of
the
clubhouse
he
a
regular
guy
said
merkle
merkle
has
lived
down
that
failure
to
touch
second
and
proved
himself
to
be
one
of
the
gamest
players
that
ever
stood
in
a
diamond
many
times
since
has
he
vindicated
himself
he
is
a
great
first
baseman
now
and
mcgraw
and
he
are
close
friends
that
is
the
inside
story
of
the
most
important
game
ever
played
in
baseball
and
merkle
connection
with
it
x
when
the
teams
are
in
spring
training
hardships
of
the
preliminary
practice
in
limbering
up
muscles
and
reducing
weight
for
the
big
campaign
how
a
ball
club
is
whipped
into
playing
shape
trips
to
the
south
not
the
picnics
they
seem
to
be
the
battle
of
the
bushers
to
stay
in
the
big
show
making
a
pitcher
some
fun
on
the
side
including
the
adventure
of
the
turkish
spring
training
the
words
probably
remind
the
reader
of
the
sunny
south
and
light
exercise
and
good
food
and
rubs
and
other
luxuries
but
the
reader
perhaps
has
never
been
with
a
big
league
ball
club
when
it
is
getting
ready
to
go
into
a
six
months
campaign
all
i
can
ever
remember
after
a
training
trip
is
taking
off
and
putting
on
a
uniform
and
running
around
the
ball
park
under
the
inspiration
of
john
mcgraw
and
he
is
some
inspirer
the
heavier
a
man
gets
through
the
winter
the
harder
the
routine
work
is
for
him
and
a
few
years
ago
i
almost
broke
down
and
cried
out
of
sympathy
for
otis
crandall
who
arrived
in
camp
very
corpulent
what
have
you
been
doing
this
winter
otie
mcgraw
asked
him
after
shaking
hands
in
greeting
appearing
with
a
show
as
the
stout
lady
you
have
to
take
a
lot
of
that
off
taking
it
off
meant
running
several
miles
every
day
so
bundled
up
that
the
indiana
agriculturist
looked
like
the
pictures
published
of
old
doc
cook
which
showed
him
discovering
the
north
pole
ever
since
spring
training
like
charity
has
begun
at
home
and
he
takes
exercise
night
and
morning
throughout
the
winter
so
that
when
he
comes
into
camp
his
weight
will
be
somewhere
near
normal
in
he
had
the
best
year
of
his
career
he
is
the
type
of
man
who
can
not
afford
to
carry
too
much
weight
he
is
stronger
when
he
is
slimmer
in
contrast
to
him
is
george
wiltse
who
maps
out
a
training
course
with
the
idea
of
adding
several
pounds
as
he
is
better
with
all
the
real
weight
he
can
put
on
by
that
i
do
not
mean
any
fat
george
came
whirling
and
spinning
and
waltzing
and
and
pirouetting
across
the
field
at
marlin
springs
texas
the
giants
spring
training
headquarters
one
day
in
the
spring
of
developing
steps
that
would
have
ruled
him
off
any
cotillion
floor
in
new
york
in
the
days
of
the
ban
on
the
grizzly
bear
and
kindred
dances
suddenly
he
dove
down
with
his
left
hand
and
reached
as
far
as
he
could
what
that
one
george
i
yelled
as
he
passed
me
getting
ready
to
cover
first
base
on
a
slow
hit
matty
he
replied
and
was
off
on
another
series
of
hand
springs
that
made
him
look
more
like
a
contortionist
rehearsing
for
an
act
which
he
was
going
to
take
out
for
the
big
time
than
a
getting
ready
for
the
season
but
perhaps
some
close
followers
of
baseball
statistics
will
recall
a
game
that
wiltse
took
from
the
cubs
in
by
a
wonderful
reaching
catch
of
a
low
throw
to
first
base
two
chicago
runners
were
on
the
bags
at
the
time
and
the
loss
of
that
throw
would
have
meant
that
they
both
scored
wiltse
caught
the
ball
and
it
made
the
third
out
and
the
giants
won
the
game
thousands
of
fans
applauded
the
catch
but
the
play
was
not
the
result
of
the
exigencies
of
the
moment
it
was
the
outcome
of
forethought
used
months
before
spectators
at
ball
games
who
wonder
at
the
marvellous
fielding
of
wiltse
should
watch
him
getting
ready
during
the
spring
season
at
marlin
he
is
a
tireless
worker
and
when
he
is
not
pitching
he
is
doing
hand
springs
and
other
acrobatic
acts
to
limber
up
all
his
muscles
it
is
torture
then
but
it
pays
in
the
end
when
i
was
a
young
fellow
and
read
about
the
big
league
clubs
going
south
i
used
to
think
what
a
grand
life
that
must
be
riding
in
pullmans
some
pleasant
exercise
which
did
not
entail
the
responsibility
of
a
ball
game
and
plenty
of
food
with
a
little
social
recreation
were
all
parts
of
my
dream
a
young
looks
on
his
first
spring
training
trip
as
a
young
woman
regards
the
theatre
she
can
not
wait
for
her
first
rehearsal
and
she
thinks
only
of
the
lobster
suppers
and
the
applause
and
the
lights
and
the
life
but
nowhere
in
her
dream
is
there
a
place
for
the
raucous
voice
of
the
stage
manager
and
the
long
jumps
of
one
night
stands
with
the
loss
of
sleep
and
the
poor
meals
and
the
cold
dressing
rooms
as
actors
begin
to
dread
the
drudgery
of
rehearsing
so
do
baseball
men
detest
the
drill
of
the
spring
training
the
only
thing
that
i
can
think
of
right
away
which
is
more
tiresome
and
less
interesting
is
signal
practice
with
a
college
football
team
about
the
time
that
the
sap
starts
up
in
the
trees
and
the
young
fancy
lightly
turns
to
thoughts
of
love
and
baseball
the
big
trek
starts
five
hundred
attached
more
or
less
firmly
to
sixteen
major
league
clubs
spread
themselves
out
over
the
southern
part
of
the
united
states
from
florida
to
california
and
begin
to
prepare
for
the
campaign
that
is
to
furnish
the
answer
to
that
annual
question
which
is
the
best
baseball
club
in
the
world
in
the
case
of
the
giants
mcgraw
with
a
flock
of
youngsters
has
already
arrived
when
the
older
men
begin
to
drift
into
camp
the
youngsters
who
have
come
from
the
bushes
and
realize
that
this
is
their
one
big
chance
to
make
good
to
be
a
success
or
a
failure
in
their
chosen
profession
in
short
to
become
a
big
leaguer
or
go
back
to
the
bushes
for
good
have
already
been
working
for
ten
days
and
are
in
fair
shape
they
stare
at
the
regulars
as
the
veterans
straggle
in
by
twos
and
threes
and
mcgraw
has
a
brief
greeting
for
each
he
could
use
a
rubber
stamp
how
are
you
matty
what
kind
of
shape
are
you
in
let
see
you
in
a
uniform
at
nine
morning
when
i
first
start
south
for
the
spring
trip
after
shivering
through
a
new
york
winter
i
arouse
myself
to
some
enthusiasm
over
the
prospect
but
all
this
has
evaporated
after
listening
to
that
terse
speech
from
mcgraw
for
i
know
what
it
means
nothing
looms
on
the
horizon
but
the
hardest
five
weeks
grind
in
the
world
the
next
day
the
practice
begins
and
for
the
first
time
in
five
months
a
uniform
is
donned
i
usually
start
my
work
by
limbering
up
slowly
and
on
the
first
day
i
do
not
pitch
at
all
with
several
other
players
i
help
to
form
a
large
circle
and
the
time
is
spent
in
throwing
the
ball
at
impossible
and
unreachable
points
in
the
anatomy
the
man
next
to
you
shoots
one
away
up
over
your
head
and
the
next
one
at
your
feet
and
off
to
the
side
while
he
is
looking
at
the
third
man
from
you
this
is
great
for
limbering
up
but
the
loosening
is
torture
after
about
fifteen
minutes
of
that
the
player
goes
over
on
the
bench
and
drops
down
exhausted
but
does
he
stay
there
not
if
mcgraw
sees
him
and
he
is
one
of
the
busiest
watchers
i
have
ever
met
here
matty
he
will
shout
lead
this
squad
three
times
around
the
park
and
be
careful
not
to
cut
the
corners
by
the
time
that
little
formality
is
finished
a
man
tongue
is
hanging
out
and
he
goes
to
get
a
drink
of
water
the
spring
training
is
just
one
darned
drink
after
another
and
still
the
player
is
always
thirsty
after
three
hours
of
practice
mcgraw
may
say
all
right
matty
go
back
to
the
hotel
and
get
a
bath
and
a
rub
and
cut
it
out
for
or
he
may
remark
you
looking
heavy
this
year
better
take
another
little
workout
this
afternoon
and
so
ends
the
first
day
that
night
i
flex
the
muscles
in
my
salary
wing
and
wonder
to
myself
if
it
is
going
to
be
sore
i
get
the
answer
next
day
and
what
always
makes
me
maddest
is
that
the
fans
up
north
imagine
that
we
are
having
some
kind
of
a
picnic
in
marlin
springs
texas
my
idea
of
no
setting
for
a
pleasure
party
is
marlin

easily
the
base
runner
with
his
deceptive
slide
can
get
away
from
the
catcher
who
has
the
ball

for

it

the
morning
of
the
second
day
is
always
a
pleasant
occasion
the
muscles
which
have
remained
idle
so
long
begin
to
rebel
at
the
unaccustomed
exercise
and
the
players
are
as
pleasant
as
a
flock
of
grizzly
bears
i
would
not
be
a
waiter
for
a
ball
club
on
a
spring
tour
if
they
offered
me
a
contract
with
a
salary
as
large
as
morgan
income
each
year
the
winter
kinks
seem
to
have
settled
into
the
muscles
more
permanently
and
are
harder
to
iron
out
of
course
there
comes
a
last
time
for
each
one
of
us
to
go
south
and
every
season
i
think
on
the
morning
of
the
second
day
when
i
try
to
work
my
muscles
that
this
one
is
my
last
the
bushers
lend
variety
to
the
life
in
a
spring
camp
many
of
them
try
hard
to
horn
in
with
the
men
who
have
made
good
as
big
leaguers
when
a
young
player
really
seems
to
want
to
know
something
any
of
the
older
men
will
gladly
help
him
but
the
trouble
with
most
of
them
is
that
they
think
they
are
wonders
when
they
arrive
how
do
you
hold
a
curve
a
young
fellow
asked
me
last
spring
i
showed
him
do
you
think
hans
wagner
is
as
good
as
ty
cobb
he
asked
me
next
listen
i
answered
did
you
come
down
here
to
learn
to
play
ball
or
with
the
idea
that
you
are
attending
some
sort
of
a
conversational
soiree
many
recruits
think
that
if
they
can
get
friendly
with
the
veterans
they
will
be
retained
on
account
of
their
social
standing
and
i
can
not
go
young
who
attempt
to
become
the
bootblacks
for
the
old
ones
i
have
seen
many
a
youngster
ruin
himself
even
for
playing
in
the
minors
through
his
too
vigorous
efforts
to
make
good
under
the
large
tent
he
will
come
into
camp
and
the
first
day
out
put
everything
he
has
on
the
ball
to
show
the
manager
he
got
something
the
giants
had
a
young
pitcher
with
them
in
named
nagle
who
tried
to
pick
up
the
pace
on
the
first
day
in
camp
at
which
he
had
left
off
on
the
closing
day
of
the
previous
year
he
started
to
shoot
the
ball
over
to
the
batters
with
big
sharp
breaking
curves
on
it
he
had
not
been
south
three
days
before
he
developed
a
sore
arm
that
required
a
sling
to
help
him
carry
it
around
and
he
never
was
able
to
twirl
again
before
he
was
shunted
back
into
the
lesser
leagues
but
hope
springs
eternal
in
the
breast
of
the
bush
leaguer
in
the
spring
and
many
a
young
fellow
when
he
gets
his
from
the
little
old
home
town
with
the
local
band
playing
at
the
station
knows
that
the
next
time
the
populace
of
that
place
hears
of
him
it
will
be
through
seeing
his
name
in
the
headlines
of
the
new
york
papers
and
then
along
about
the
middle
of
april
he
comes
sneaking
back
into
the
old
burg
crestfallen
and
disappointed
there
are
a
lot
of
humor
and
some
pathos
in
a
spring
training
trip
many
a
busher
i
have
seen
go
back
who
has
tried
hard
to
make
good
and
just
could
not
and
i
have
felt
sorry
for
him
it
is
just
like
a
man
in
any
other
business
getting
a
chance
at
a
better
job
than
the
one
he
is
holding
and
not
being
big
enough
to
fit
it
it
is
the
one
time
that
opportunity
has
knocked
and
most
of
the
bush
leaguers
do
not
know
the
combination
to
open
the
door
and
as
has
been
pointed
out
opportunity
was
never
charged
with
picking
locks
many
are
called
in
the
spring
but
few
get
past
most
of
them
are
sincere
young
fellows
too
trying
to
make
good
and
i
have
seen
them
work
until
their
tongues
were
hanging
out
and
the
perspiration
was
starting
all
over
them
only
to
hear
mcgraw
say
i
sorry
but
you
will
have
to
go
back
again
i
let
you
out
to
kankakee
steve
evans
who
now
plays
right
field
on
the
louis
club
was
south
with
the
giants
one
season
and
worked
hard
to
stick
but
mcgraw
had
a
lot
of
young
and
some
minor
league
magnate
from
montreal
came
into
camp
one
day
who
liked
steve
action
mcgraw
started
for
the
outfield
where
evans
was
chasing
flies
and
tried
to
get
to
steve
but
every
time
the
manager
approached
him
with
the
minor
league
man
evans
would
rush
for
a
ball
on
another
corner
of
the
field
and
he
became
suddenly
hard
of
hearing
finally
mcgraw
abandoned
the
chase
and
let
another
go
to
montreal
retaining
evans
say
said
mac
that
night
why
did
you
come
when
i
called
you
out
on
the
field
there
this
afternoon
because
i
could
hear
the
rattle
of
the
tin
can
you
wanted
to
tie
to
me
all
over
the
lot
replied
evans
and
eventually
by
that
subtle
dodging
he
landed
in
the
big
league
under
bresnahan
and
has
made
good
out
there
i
believe
that
a
pitcher
by
profession
has
the
hardest
time
of
any
of
the
specialists
who
go
into
a
spring
camp
his
work
is
of
a
more
routine
nature
than
that
which
attaches
to
any
of
the
other
branches
of
the
baseball
art
it
is
nothing
but
a
steady
grind
the
pitcher
goes
out
each
morning
and
gets
a
catcher
with
a
big
mitt
and
a
loud
voice
and
with
a
couple
of
his
fellow
artists
starts
to
warm
up
with
this
the
right
sort
of
a
catcher
for
spring
rehearsing
is
never
satisfied
with
anything
you
do
i
never
try
to
throw
a
curve
for
ten
days
at
least
after
i
get
south
for
a
misplaced
curve
early
in
the
season
may
give
a
man
a
sore
arm
for
the
greater
part
of
the
summer
and
big
league
clubs
are
not
paying
pitchers
for
wearing
crippled
whips
after
warming
up
for
an
hour
or
so
three
or
four
pitchers
throw
slow
ones
to
a
batter
and
try
to
get
the
ball
on
the
half
bounce
and
compete
as
to
the
number
of
fumbles
this
is
great
for
limbering
up
then
comes
the
only
real
enjoyment
of
the
day
it
is
quick
in
passing
like
a
piece
of
great
scenery
viewed
out
of
the
window
of
a
railroad
coach
going
sixty
miles
an
hour
each
afternoon
the
regulars
play
the
yannigans
the
spring
name
of
the
second
team
a
game
of
six
innings
and
each
pitcher
has
a
chance
to
work
about
one
inning
the
batters
are
away
off
form
and
are
missing
the
old
curve
by
two
feet
that
they
would
hit
out
of
the
lot
in
this
makes
you
think
for
a
few
minutes
that
you
are
a
good
pitcher
but
there
is
even
a
drawback
to
this
brief
bit
of
enjoyment
for
the
diamond
at
marlin
is
skinned
that
is
made
of
dirt
although
it
is
billed
as
a
grass
infield
and
the
ball
gets
wingy
little
pieces
of
the
cover
are
torn
loose
by
contact
with
the
rough
dirt
and
it
is
not
at
all
like
the
hard
smooth
ball
that
is
prevalent
around
the
circuit
in
grass
seed
has
been
planted
on
this
infield
but
so
far
like
a
lot
of
bushers
it
has
failed
to
make
good
its
promises
after
that
game
comes
the
inevitable
run
around
the
park
which
has
been
a
headliner
in
spring
training
ever
since
the
institution
was
discovered
a
story
is
told
of
cap
anson
and
his
famous
old
white
stockings
according
to
the
reports
i
have
heard
training
with
the
cap
when
he
was
right
was
no
bed
of
roses
after
hours
of
practice
he
would
lead
the
men
in
long
runs
and
the
better
he
felt
the
longer
the
runs
one
hot
day
so
the
story
goes
anson
was
toiling
around
the
park
with
his
usual
determination
at
the
head
of
a
string
of
steaming
sweating
players
when
bill
dahlen
a
clever
man
at
finding
an
opening
discovered
a
loose
board
in
the
fence
on
the
back
stretch
pulled
it
off
and
dived
through
the
hole
on
the
next
lap
two
more
tired
athletes
followed
him
and
at
last
the
whole
squad
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
watching
their
leader
run
on
tirelessly
but
cap
must
have
missed
the
plunk
plunk
of
the
footsteps
behind
him
for
he
looked
around
and
saw
that
his
players
were
gone
he
kept
grimly
on
alone
until
he
had
finished
and
then
he
pushed
his
red
face
through
the
hole
in
the
fence
and
saw
his
men
your
turn
now
boys
he
said
and
while
he
sat
in
the
as
the
sole
spectator
he
made
that
crowd
of
unfortunate
athletes
run
around
the
track
twice
as
many
times
as
he
himself
had
done
guess
i
wo
have
to
nail
up
that
hole
in
the
fence
boys
cap
remarked
when
it
was
all
over
speaking
of
the
influence
of
catchers
on
pitchers
during
the
training
trip
there
is
the
case
of
wilbert
robinson
the
old
catcher
and
rube
marquard
the
great
pitcher
of
the
giants
robbie
devoted
himself
almost
entirely
in
the
spring
of
to
the
training
of
the
then
erratic
rube
and
he
handed
back
to
mcgraw
at
the
end
of
the
rehearsal
the
man
who
turned
out
to
be
the
premier
pitcher
of
his
league
according
to
the
official
figures
and
figures
are
not
in
the
habit
of
lying
robbie
used
to
take
marquard
off
into
some
corner
every
day
and
talk
to
him
for
hours
draw
up
close
for
i
am
going
to
tell
you
the
secret
of
how
marquard
became
a
great
pitcher
and
that
too
at
just
about
the
time
the
papers
were
mentioning
him
as
the
lemon
and
imploring
mcgraw
to
let
him
go
to
some
club
in
exchange
for
a
good
capable
bat
boy
now
would
be
robbie
first
line
in
the
daily
lecture
got
to
start
on
the
first
ball
to
get
the
batter
always
have
something
on
him
and
never
let
him
have
anything
on
you
this
is
the
prescription
for
a
great
pitcher
one
of
the
worst
habits
of
marquard
early
days
was
to
get
a
couple
of
strikes
on
a
batter
and
then
let
up
until
he
got
himself
into
a
hole
and
could
not
put
the
ball
over
robinson
by
his
coaching
gave
him
the
confidence
he
lacked
you
got
a
lot
of
stuff
robbie
would
advise
but
do
try
to
get
it
all
on
the
ball
mix
it
with
a
little
control
and
it
will
make
a
great
blend
now
this
guy
is
a
high
ball
hitter
let
see
you
keep
it
low
for
him
he
waits
so
you
will
have
to
get
it
over
and
out
there
in
the
hot
texas
sun
with
much
advice
and
lots
of
patience
wilbert
robinson
was
manufacturing
a
great
pitcher
out
of
the
raw
material
one
of
marquard
worst
faults
when
he
first
broke
into
the
league
was
that
he
did
not
know
the
batters
and
their
grooves
and
these
weaknesses
robinson
drilled
into
his
head
not
that
a
drill
was
required
to
insert
the
information
robinson
was
the
coacher
umpire
catcher
and
batter
rolled
into
one
and
as
a
result
look
at
the
rube
when
marquard
began
to
wabble
a
little
toward
the
end
of
and
to
show
some
of
his
old
shyness
while
the
club
was
on
its
last
trip
west
robinson
hurried
on
to
chicago
and
worked
with
him
for
two
days
the
rube
had
lost
the
first
game
of
the
series
to
the
cubs
but
he
turned
around
after
robinson
joined
us
and
beat
them
to
death
in
the
last
contest
pitchers
old
and
young
are
always
trying
for
new
curves
in
the
spring
practice
and
out
of
the
south
wafted
over
the
wires
by
the
fertile
imaginations
of
the
flotilla
of
correspondents
drift
tales
each
spring
of
the
fish
ball
and
the
new
hook
jump
and
the
stop
ball
and
many
more
eccentric
curves
which
usually
boil
down
to
modifications
of
the
old
ones
i
worked
for
two
weeks
once
on
a
new
slow
spit
ball
that
would
wabble
but
the
trouble
was
that
i
could
never
tell
just
when
or
where
it
was
going
to
wabble
and
so
at
last
i
had
to
abandon
it
because
i
could
not
control
it
after
sending
out
fake
stories
of
new
and
wonderful
curves
for
several
years
at
last
the
correspondents
got
a
new
one
when
the
spit
ball
was
first
discovered
by
stricklett
a
brooklyn
pitcher
several
seasons
ago
one
chicago
correspondent
sent
back
to
his
paper
a
glowing
tale
of
the
wonderful
new
curve
called
the
spit
ball
which
was
obtained
by
the
use
of
saliva
only
to
get
a
wire
from
his
office
which
read
it
all
right
to
about
new
curves
but
when
it
comes
to
being
vulgar
about
it
that
going
too
far
either
drop
that
spit
ball
or
mail
us
your
resignation
the
paper
refused
to
print
the
story
and
a
real
new
curve
was
born
without
its
notice
as
a
matter
of
fact
bowerman
the
old
giant
catcher
was
throwing
the
spit
ball
for
two
or
three
years
before
it
was
discovered
to
be
a
pitching
asset
he
used
to
wet
his
fingers
when
catching
and
as
he
threw
to
second
base
the
ball
would
take
all
sorts
of
eccentric
breaks
which
fooled
the
baseman
and
none
could
explain
why
it
did
it
until
stricklett
came
through
with
the
spit
ball
many
good
pitchers
who
feel
their
arms
begin
to
weaken
work
on
certain
freak
motions
or
forms
of
delivery
to
make
themselves
more
effective
or
draw
out
their
baseball
life
in
the
big
leagues
for
a
year
or
two
a
story
is
told
of
matty
kilroy
a
who
lived
for
two
years
through
the
development
of
what
he
called
the
bazzazaz
balk
and
it
had
the
same
effect
on
his
pitching
as
administering
oxygen
often
has
on
a
patient
who
is
almost
dead
my
old
soup
bone
says
kilroy
was
so
weak
that
i
could
break
a
pane
of
glass
at
fifty
feet
so
one
winter
i
spent
some
time
every
day
out
in
the
back
yard
getting
that
balk
motion
down
i
had
a
pretty
fair
balk
motion
when
my
arm
was
good
but
i
saw
that
it
had
to
be
better
so
i
put
one
stone
in
the
yard
for
a
home
plate
and
another
up
against
the
fence
for
first
base
then
i
practised
looking
at
the
home
plate
stone
and
throwing
at
first
base
with
a
snap
of
the
wrist
and
without
moving
my
feet
it
was
stare
steady
at
the
batter
then
the
arm
up
to
about
my
ear
and
zip
with
a
twist
of
the
wrist
at
first
base
and
you
got
him
i
got
so
i
could
throw
harder
to
the
bag
with
that
wrist
wriggle
than
i
could
to
the
batter
and
i
had
them
stickin
closer
to
the
base
for
two
years
than
a
fellow
does
to
his
gal
when
they
just
decided
they
would
do
for
each
other
as
a
rule
mcgraw
takes
charge
of
the
batters
and
general
team
work
at
spring
practice
and
he
is
one
of
the
busiest
little
persons
in
seven
counties
for
he
says
a
lot
depends
on
the
start
a
club
gets
in
a
league
race
he
always
wants
the
first
jump
because
it
is
lots
easier
falling
back
than
catching
up
after
a
week
or
so
of
practice
the
team
is
divided
up
into
two
squads
and
one
goes
to
san
antonio
and
the
other
to
houston
each
saturday
and
sunday
to
play
games
one
of
the
older
men
takes
charge
of
the
younger
players
and
there
is
a
lot
of
rivalry
between
the
two
teams
to
see
which
one
will
make
the
better
record
i
remember
one
year
i
was
handling
the
youngsters
and
we
went
to
houston
to
play
the
team
there
and
just
managed
to
nose
out
a
victory
mcgraw
thought
that
for
the
next
saturday
he
had
better
strengthen
the
yannigans
up
a
bit
so
he
sent
roger
bresnahan
along
to
play
third
base
instead
of
henderson
the
young
fellow
we
had
the
week
before
playing
third
base
could
not
exactly
have
been
called
a
habit
with
rog
at
that
time
he
was
still
pretty
fat
and
bending
over
quick
after
grounders
was
not
his
regular
line
he
booted
two
or
three
and
finally
managed
to
lose
the
game
for
us
we
sent
mcgraw
the
following
telegram
that
night
john
mcgraw
manager
of
the
giants
san
antonio
texas
will
trade
bresnahan
for
henderson
rush
answer
mcgraw
does
not
like
to
have
any
of
his
clubs
beaten
by
the
minor
leaguers
because
the
bushers
are
inclined
to
imitate
pouter
pigeons
right
away
after
beating
the
big
leaguers
the
social
side
of
a
training
trip
consists
of
kicking
about
the
grub
singing
songs
at
night
and
listening
to
the
same
old
stories
that
creep
out
of
the
bushes
on
crutches
year
after
year
last
spring
the
food
got
so
bad
that
some
of
the
newspaper
men
fixed
up
a
fake
story
they
said
they
were
going
to
send
to
new
york
displayed
it
to
the
proprietor
and
he
came
through
with
beefsteak
for
three
nights
in
succession
thus
establishing
a
record
and
proving
the
power
of
the
press
the
trouble
with
the
diet
schedule
on
a
spring
trip
is
that
almost
invariably
those
hotels
on
the
circuits
serve
dinner
in
the
middle
of
the
day
just
when
a
does
not
feel
like
eating
anything
much
then
at
night
they
have
a
supper
when
one
stomach
feels
as
if
it
thought
a
fellow
throat
had
been
cut
the
giants
had
an
umpire
with
them
in
the
spring
of
named
hansell
who
enlivened
the
long
weary
training
season
some
like
a
lot
of
the
recruits
who
thought
that
they
were
great
this
hansell
firmly
believed
he
was
a
great
umpire
he
used
to
try
to
put
players
who
did
not
agree
with
his
decisions
out
of
the
game
and
of
course
they
would
not
go
why
do
you
have
them
arrested
if
they
wo
leave
mcgraw
asked
him
one
day
i
would
so
the
next
afternoon
hansell
had
a
couple
of
the
local
constables
out
at
the
grounds
and
tried
to
have
devore
pinched
for
kicking
on
a
decision
josh
got
sore
and
framed
it
up
to
have
a
camera
man
at
the
park
the
next
day
to
take
a
moving
picture
of
a
mob
scene
hansell
the
umpire
to
be
the
hero
and
mobbed
hansell
fell
for
it
until
he
saw
all
the
boys
picking
up
real
clods
and
digging
the
dirt
out
of
their
spikes
and
then
he
made
a
run
for
it
and
never
came
back
that
is
how
we
lost
a
great
umpire
you
boys
made
it
look
too
realistic
for
him
declared
mcgraw
hansell
had
a
notion
that
he
was
a
runner
and
offered
to
bet
robinson
who
is
rather
corpulent
now
that
he
could
beat
him
running
across
the
field
robinson
took
him
and
walked
home
ahead
of
the
umpire
in
the
race
i
do
see
where
i
get
off
on
this
deal
complained
mcgraw
when
it
was
over
i
framed
up
this
race
for
you
two
fellows
and
then
hansell
comes
to
me
and
borrows
the
ten
to
pay
somebody
fixed
up
a
turkish
bath
in
the
hotel
one
day
by
stuffing
up
the
cracks
in
one
of
the
bathrooms
and
turning
the
hot
water
into
the
tub
and
the
steam
into
the
radiator
full
blast
several
towels
were
piled
on
the
radiator
and
the
players
sat
upon
this
swathed
in
blankets
to
take
off
weight
they
entered
the
impromptu
turkish
bath
wearing
only
the
smile
mcgraw
still
maintains
that
it
was
bugs
raymond
who
pulled
out
the
towels
when
it
came
the
turn
to
sit
on
the
radiator
and
if
he
could
have
proved
his
case
raymond
would
not
have
needed
a
doctor
it
would
have
been
time
for
the
undertaker
finally
comes
the
long
wending
of
the
way
up
north
bugs
raymond
always
depends
on
his
friends
for
his
refreshments
and
as
he
had
few
friends
in
marlin
in
he
got
few
drinks
but
when
we
got
to
dallas
cocktails
were
served
with
the
dinner
and
all
the
left
them
untouched
mcgraw
enforcing
the
old
rule
that
lips
that
touch
licker
shall
never
moisten
a
spit
ball
for
him
bugs
was
missed
after
supper
and
some
one
found
him
out
in
the
kitchen
licking
up
all
the
discarded
martinis
that
was
the
occasion
of
his
first
fine
of
the
season
and
after
that
as
bugs
himself
admitted
life
for
him
was
just
one
fine
after
another
at
last
after
the
long
junket
through
the
south
on
which
all
managers
are
simon
legrees
is
ended
comes
a
welcome
day
when
the
new
uniforms
are
donned
and
the
band
plays
and
them
woids
which
constitute
the
sweetest
music
to
the
ears
of
a
roll
off
the
tongue
of
the
umpire
the
batteries
for
are
rucker
and
bergen
for
brooklyn
marquard
and
meyers
for
new
york
play
ball
the
season
is
on
xi
jinxes
and
what
they
mean
to
a
load
of
empty
barrels
hired
by
john
mcgraw
once
pulled
the
giants
out
of
a
losing
streak
the
child
of
superstition
appears
to
the
in
many
forms
various
ways
in
which
the
influence
of
the
jinx
can
be
overcome
the
true
story
of
charley
faust
the
necktie
that
helped
win
a
a
friend
of
mine
who
took
a
different
fork
in
the
road
when
we
left
college
from
the
one
that
i
have
followed
was
walking
down
broadway
in
new
york
with
me
one
morning
after
i
had
joined
the
giants
and
we
passed
a
man
i
grabbed
off
my
hat
and
spat
in
it
it
was
a
new
hat
too
what
the
matter
with
you
matty
he
asked
surprised
spit
in
your
hat
quick
and
kill
that
jinx
i
answered
not
thinking
for
the
minute
and
he
followed
my
example
i
forgot
to
mention
when
i
said
he
took
another
fork
in
the
road
that
he
had
become
a
pitcher
too
but
of
a
different
kind
he
had
turned
out
to
be
sort
of
a
conversational
pitcher
for
he
was
a
minister
and
as
luck
would
have
it
on
the
morning
we
met
that
man
he
was
wearing
a
silk
hat
i
was
shocked
pained
and
mortified
when
i
saw
what
i
had
made
him
do
but
he
was
the
right
sort
and
wanted
to
go
through
with
the
thing
according
to
the
standards
of
the
professional
man
with
whom
he
happened
to
be
at
the
time
what
the
idea
he
asked
as
he
replaced
his
hat
worst
jinx
in
the
world
to
see
a
man
i
replied
but
i
hope
i
did
hurt
your
silk
hat
i
quickly
apologized
not
at
all
but
how
about
these
who
masticate
the
weed
do
they
kill
jinxes
too
he
wanted
to
know
and
i
had
to
admit
that
they
were
the
main
exterminators
of
the
jinx
then
he
went
on
i
glad
that
the
percentage
of
wearers
of
cross
eyes
is
small
i
have
just
looked
into
one
of
my
favorite
works
for
that
word
jinx
and
found
it
not
my
search
was
in
webster
dictionary
but
any
can
give
a
definition
of
it
with
his
hands
tied
behind
him
that
is
any
one
except
arlie
latham
and
with
his
hands
bound
he
is
deaf
and
dumb
a
jinx
is
something
which
brings
bad
luck
to
a
and
the
members
of
the
profession
have
built
up
a
series
of
lucky
and
unlucky
omens
that
should
be
catalogued
and
besides
the
common
or
garden
variety
of
jinxes
many
stars
have
a
series
of
private
or
pet
and
trained
ones
that
are
more
malignant
in
their
forms
than
those
which
come
out
in
the
open
a
jinx
is
the
child
of
superstition
and
are
among
the
most
superstitious
persons
in
the
world
notwithstanding
all
this
conversation
lately
about
educated
men
breaking
into
the
game
and
paying
no
attention
whatever
to
the
good
and
bad
omens
college
men
are
coming
into
both
the
leagues
more
of
them
each
year
and
they
are
doing
their
share
to
make
the
game
better
and
the
class
of
men
higher
but
they
fall
the
hardest
for
the
jinxes
and
i
do
know
as
it
is
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
at
that
a
really
true
jinx
can
do
all
sorts
of
mean
things
to
a
professional
i
have
seen
it
make
a
bad
pitcher
out
of
a
good
one
and
a
blind
batter
out
of
a
hitter
and
i
have
seen
it
make
a
ball
club
composed
of
educated
men
carry
a
kansas
farmer
with
two
or
three
screws
rattling
loose
in
his
dome
around
the
circuit
because
he
came
as
a
prophet
and
said
that
he
was
accompanied
by
miss
fickle
fortune
and
that
is
almost
a
jinx
record
jinx
and
miss
fickle
fortune
never
go
around
together
and
are
always
trying
to
kill
this
jinx
for
once
he
joins
the
club
all
hope
is
gone
he
dies
hard
and
many
a
good
hat
has
been
ruined
in
an
effort
to
destroy
him
as
i
have
said
before
because
the
wearer
happened
to
be
chewing
tobacco
when
the
jinx
dropped
around
but
what
a
new
hat
against
a
losing
streak
or
a
batting
slump
luck
is
a
combination
of
confidence
and
getting
the
breaks
get
no
breaks
without
confidence
in
themselves
and
lucky
omens
inspire
this
confidence
on
the
other
hand
unlucky
signs
take
it
away
the
lucky
man
is
the
one
who
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
and
not
his
fingers
and
the
ability
to
swat
the
nail
on
its
receptive
end
is
a
combination
of
and
an
aptitude
for
hammering
good
is
the
combination
of
and
the
ability
to
play
the
next
is
red
ames
although
designated
as
leon
by
his
family
when
a
very
small
boy
before
he
began
to
play
ball
he
is
still
called
leon
in
the
winter
ames
is
of
warren
ohio
and
the
giants
and
he
is
said
to
hold
the
marathon
record
for
being
the
most
unlucky
pitcher
that
ever
lived
and
i
agree
with
the
sayers
for
several
seasons
ames
seem
to
win
a
ball
game
no
matter
how
well
he
pitched
in
red
twirled
a
game
on
the
opening
day
of
the
season
against
brooklyn
that
was
the
work
of
a
master
for
nine
innings
he
held
his
opponents
hitless
only
to
have
them
win
in
the
thirteenth
time
and
again
ames
has
pitched
brilliantly
to
be
finally
beaten
by
a
small
score
because
one
of
the
men
behind
him
made
an
error
at
a
critical
moment
or
because
the
team
could
not
give
him
any
runs
by
which
to
win
no
wonder
the
newspapers
began
to
speak
of
ames
as
the
hoodoo
pitcher
and
the
man
who
could
win
there
was
a
fellow
who
lived
between
ames
and
the
polo
grounds
and
red
used
to
make
a
detour
of
several
blocks
en
route
to
the
park
to
be
sure
to
miss
him
in
case
he
should
be
out
walking
but
one
day
in
when
it
was
his
turn
to
pitch
he
bumped
into
that
man
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
did
his
duty
by
his
hat
and
got
three
or
four
small
boys
to
help
him
out
he
failed
to
last
two
innings
when
it
came
time
to
go
west
on
the
final
trip
of
the
season
ames
was
badly
discouraged
i
do
see
any
use
in
taking
me
along
mac
he
said
to
mcgraw
a
few
days
before
we
left
the
club
ca
win
with
me
pitching
if
the
other
guys
do
even
get
a
foul
the
first
stop
was
in
boston
and
on
the
day
we
arrived
it
rained
in
the
mail
that
day
addressed
to
leon
ames
came
a
necktie
and
a
clover
from
a
prominent
actress
wishing
ames
good
luck
the
directions
were
inside
the
envelope
the
clover
if
the
charm
were
to
work
must
be
worn
on
both
the
uniform
and
street
clothes
and
the
necktie
was
to
be
worn
with
the
street
clothes
and
concealed
in
the
uniform
if
that
necktie
could
be
concealed
anywhere
it
would
have
done
for
a
headlight
and
made
joseph
coat
of
many
colors
look
like
a
mourning
garment
might
as
well
wish
good
luck
to
a
guy
on
the
way
to
the
morgue
murmured
ames
as
he
surveyed
the
layout
but
he
manfully
put
on
the
necktie
taking
his
first
dose
of
the
prescription
as
directed
at
once
and
he
tucked
the
clover
away
carefully
in
his
wallet
you
got
your
work
cut
out
for
you
old
boy
he
remarked
to
the
charm
as
he
put
it
away
but
i
wear
you
if
you
were
a
horseshoe
the
first
day
that
ames
pitched
in
boston
he
won
and
won
in
a
stroll
the
necktie
he
explained
that
night
at
dinner
and
pointed
to
the
affair
he
was
wearing
around
his
collar
i
do
change
her
until
i
lose
he
did
lose
a
game
on
that
once
he
almost
did
when
he
was
taken
out
in
the
sixth
inning
and
a
batter
put
in
for
him
but
the
giants
finally
pulled
out
the
victory
and
he
got
the
credit
for
it
he
swept
through
the
west
unbeatable
letting
down
pittsburg
with
two
or
three
hits
cleaning
up
in
louis
and
finally
breaking
our
losing
streak
in
chicago
after
two
games
had
gone
against
us
and
all
the
time
he
wore
that
spectrum
around
his
collar
for
a
necktie
as
it
frayed
with
the
wear
and
tear
more
colors
began
to
show
although
i
did
think
it
possible
if
he
had
had
occasion
to
put
on
his
evening
clothes
i
believe
that
tie
would
have
gone
with
it
for
my
part
i
would
almost
rather
have
lost
a
game
and
changed
the
necktie
since
it
gave
one
the
feeling
all
the
time
that
he
was
carrying
it
around
with
him
because
he
had
had
the
wrong
end
of
an
election
bet
or
something
of
the
sort
but
not
ames
he
was
a
game
guy
he
stuck
with
the
necktie
and
it
stuck
with
him
and
the
combination
kept
right
on
winning
ball
games
maybe
he
did
mind
it
because
he
could
not
see
it
himself
unless
he
looked
in
a
mirror
but
it
was
rough
on
the
rest
of
the
team
except
that
we
needed
the
games
the
necktie
won
to
take
the
pennant
columns
were
printed
in
the
newspapers
about
that
necktie
and
it
became
the
most
famous
scarf
in
the
world
ames
used
to
sleep
with
it
under
his
pillow
alongside
of
his
bank
roll
and
he
did
lose
another
game
until
the
very
end
of
the
season
when
he
dropped
one
against
brooklyn
i
do
hardly
lay
that
up
against
the
tie
he
said
afterwards
you
see
mac
put
all
those
youngsters
into
it
and
i
did
get
any
support
analyzing
is
a
distasteful
pastime
to
me
but
let
see
what
it
was
that
made
ames
win
was
it
the
necktie
perhaps
not
but
some
sliver
of
confidence
which
resulted
from
that
first
game
when
he
was
dressed
up
in
the
scarf
and
the
clover
got
stuck
in
his
mind
and
after
that
the
rest
was
easy
frank
chance
the
manager
of
the
cubs
has
a
funny
superstition
which
is
of
the
personal
sort
most
have
a
natural
prejudice
against
the
number
in
any
form
but
particularly
when
attached
to
a
pullman
berth
but
chance
always
insists
whenever
possible
that
he
have
lower
he
says
that
if
he
can
just
crawl
in
under
that
number
he
is
sure
of
a
good
night
rest
a
safe
journey
and
a
victory
the
next
day
he
has
been
in
two
or
three
minor
railroad
accidents
and
he
declares
that
all
these
occurred
when
he
was
sleeping
on
some
other
shelf
besides
lower
he
can
usually
satisfy
his
hobby
too
for
most
travellers
steer
clear
of
the
berth
mcgraw
believes
a
stateroom
brings
him
good
luck
or
at
least
he
always
insists
on
having
one
when
he
can
get
it
chance
can
have
says
mac
but
give
me
a
stateroom
for
luck
most
nowadays
treat
the
superstitions
of
the
game
as
jokes
probably
because
they
are
a
little
ashamed
to
acknowledge
their
weaknesses
but
away
down
underneath
they
observe
the
proprieties
of
the
ritual
why
even
i
wo
warm
up
with
the
third
baseman
while
i
am
waiting
for
the
catcher
to
get
on
his
mask
and
the
rest
of
his
paraphernalia
once
when
i
first
broke
in
with
the
giants
i
warmed
up
with
the
third
baseman
between
innings
and
in
the
next
round
they
hit
me
hard
and
knocked
me
out
of
the
box
since
then
i
have
had
an
uncommon
prejudice
against
the
practice
and
i
hate
to
hear
a
man
even
mention
it
devlin
knows
of
my
weakness
and
never
suggests
it
when
he
is
playing
the
bag
but
occasionally
a
new
performer
will
drill
into
the
box
score
at
third
base
and
yell
come
on
matty
warm
up
here
while
you
waiting
it
gets
me
i
pitch
to
the
first
baseman
or
a
substitute
catcher
to
keep
warm
but
i
would
rather
freeze
to
death
than
heat
up
with
the
third
baseman
that
is
one
of
my
pet
jinxes
and
speaking
of
arthur
devlin
he
has
a
few
jinxes
of
his
own
too
for
instance
he
never
likes
to
hear
a
player
hum
a
tune
on
the
bench
because
he
thinks
it
will
keep
him
from
getting
a
base
hit
he
nearly
beat
a
youngster
to
death
one
day
when
he
kept
on
humming
after
devlin
had
told
him
to
stop
cut
that
out
caruso
yelled
arthur
as
the
recruit
started
his
melody
you
are
killing
base
hits
the
busher
continued
with
his
air
until
devlin
tried
another
form
of
persuasion
arthur
also
has
a
favorite
seat
on
the
bench
which
he
believes
is
luckier
than
the
rest
and
he
insists
on
sitting
in
just
that
one
place
but
the
worst
blow
devlin
ever
had
was
when
some
young
lady
admirer
of
his
in
his
palmy
days
who
unfortunately
wore
her
eyes
crossed
insisted
on
sitting
behind
third
base
for
each
game
so
as
to
be
near
him
arthur
noticed
her
one
day
and
after
that
it
was
all
off
he
hit
the
worst
slump
of
his
career
for
a
while
no
one
could
understand
it
but
at
last
he
confessed
to
mcgraw
mac
he
said
one
night
in
the
it
that
jinx
have
you
noticed
her
she
sits
behind
the
bag
every
day
and
she
has
got
me
going
she
has
sure
slid
the
casters
under
me
i
wish
we
could
bar
her
out
or
poison
her
or
shoot
her
or
chloroform
her
or
kill
her
in
some
nice
mild
way
because
if
it
is
done
this
league
is
going
to
lose
a
how
can
you
expect
a
guy
to
play
with
that
overlooking
him
every
afternoon
mcgraw
took
devlin
out
of
the
game
for
a
time
after
that
and
the
newspapers
printed
several
yards
about
the
jinx
who
had
ruined
the
giants
third
baseman
with
the
infield
weakened
by
the
loss
of
devlin
the
club
began
to
lose
with
great
regularity
but
one
day
the
jinxess
was
missing
and
she
never
came
back
she
must
have
read
in
the
newspapers
what
she
was
doing
to
devlin
her
hero
and
quit
the
national
pastime
or
moved
to
another
part
of
the
stand
with
this
weight
off
his
shoulders
arthur
went
back
into
the
game
and
played
like
mad
if
she
stuck
much
longer
declared
mcgraw
joyous
in
his
rejuvenated
third
baseman
i
would
have
had
her
eyes
operated
on
and
straightened
this
club
could
afford
to
keep
on
losing
ball
games
because
you
are
such
a
romeo
arthur
that
even
the
ones
fall
for
you
are
very
superstitious
about
the
bats
did
you
ever
notice
how
the
clubs
are
all
laid
out
in
a
neat
even
row
before
the
bench
and
are
scrupulously
kept
that
way
by
the
bat
boy
if
one
of
the
sticks
by
any
chance
gets
crossed
all
the
players
will
shout
uncross
the
bats
uncross
the
bats
it
as
bad
as
discovering
a
fire
in
an
excelsior
factory
do
believe
it
then
listen
to
what
happened
to
the
giants
once
because
a
careless
bat
boy
neglected
his
duty
the
team
was
playing
in
cincinnati
in
the
season
of
when
one
of
the
bats
got
crossed
through
the
carelessness
of
the
boy
what
was
the
result
mike
donlin
the
star
slugger
of
the
team
slid
into
third
base
and
came
up
with
a
broken
ankle
ever
since
that
time
we
have
carried
our
own
boy
with
us
because
a
club
with
championship
aspirations
can
not
afford
to
take
a
chance
with
those
foreign
artists
handling
the
bats
they
are
likely
to
throw
you
down
at
any
time
the
athletics
have
a
funny
superstition
which
is
private
or
confined
to
their
team
as
far
as
i
know
when
luck
seems
to
be
breaking
against
them
in
a
game
they
will
take
the
bats
and
throw
them
wildly
into
the
air
and
let
them
lie
around
in
front
of
their
bench
they
call
this
changing
the
luck
but
any
other
club
would
consider
that
it
was
the
worst
kind
of
a
jinx
it
is
the
same
theory
that
have
about
shuffling
the
deck
vigorously
to
bring
a
different
run
of
fortune
then
if
the
luck
changes
the
athletics
throw
the
bats
around
some
more
to
keep
it
this
act
nearly
cost
them
one
of
their
best
in
the
third
game
of
the
world
series
the
philadelphia
players
had
tossed
their
bats
to
break
their
run
of
luck
for
the
score
was
to
against
them
when
baker
came
up
in
the
ninth
inning
he
cracked
his
now
famous
home
run
into
the
bleachers
and
the
men
on
the
bench
hurled
the
bats
wildly
into
the
air
in
jumping
up
and
reaching
for
a
bat
to
throw
jack
barry
the
shortstop
hit
his
head
on
the
concrete
roof
of
the
structure
and
was
stunned
for
a
minute
he
said
that
little
black
specks
were
floating
in
front
of
his
eyes
but
he
gamely
insisted
on
playing
the
contest
out
connie
mack
was
so
worried
over
his
condition
that
he
sent
ira
thomas
out
on
the
field
to
inquire
if
he
were
all
right
and
this
interrupted
the
game
in
the
ninth
inning
a
lot
of
the
spectators
thought
that
thomas
was
out
there
bearing
some
secret
message
from
connie
mack
none
knew
that
he
was
ascertaining
the
health
of
a
player
who
had
almost
killed
himself
while
killing
a
jinx
the
athletics
for
two
seasons
have
carried
with
them
on
all
their
trips
a
combination
bat
boy
and
mascot
who
is
a
hunchback
and
he
outjinxed
our
champion
jinx
killer
charley
faust
in
the
world
series
a
hunchback
is
regarded
by
as
the
best
luck
in
the
world
if
a
man
can
just
touch
that
hump
on
the
way
to
the
plate
he
is
sure
to
get
a
hit
and
any
observant
spectator
will
notice
the
athletics
hitters
rubbing
the
hunchback
boy
before
leaving
the
bench
so
attached
to
this
boy
have
the
players
become
that
they
voted
him
half
a
share
of
the
prize
money
last
year
after
the
world
series
lots
of
would
tell
you
that
he
deserved
it
because
he
has
won
two
world
pennants
for
them
another
great
piece
of
luck
is
for
a
to
rub
a
colored
head
i
walked
along
the
street
with
and
seen
them
stop
a
young
negro
and
take
off
his
hat
and
run
their
hands
through
his
kinky
hair
then
i
seen
the
same
go
out
and
get
two
or
three
hits
that
afternoon
and
play
the
game
of
his
life
again
it
is
the
confidence
inspired
coupled
with
the
ability
another
old
superstition
among
is
that
a
load
of
empty
barrels
means
base
hits
if
an
athlete
can
just
pass
a
flock
of
them
on
the
way
to
the
park
he
is
sure
to
step
right
along
stride
for
stride
with
the
hitters
that
afternoon
mcgraw
once
broke
up
a
batting
slump
of
the
giants
with
a
load
of
empty
barrels
that
is
why
i
maintain
he
is
the
greatest
manager
of
them
all
he
takes
advantage
of
the
little
things
even
the
superstitions
of
his
men
and
turns
them
to
his
account
he
played
this
trick
in
one
of
the
first
years
that
he
managed
the
new
york
club
the
batting
of
all
the
players
had
slumped
at
the
same
time
none
could
hit
and
the
club
was
losing
game
after
game
as
a
result
because
the
easiest
pitchers
were
making
the
best
batters
look
foolish
one
day
bowerman
came
into
the
clubhouse
with
a
smile
on
his
face
for
the
first
time
in
a
week
saw
a
big
load
of
empty
barrels
this
afternoon
boys
he
announced
and
just
watch
me
pickle
the
pill
out
there
right
at
that
point
mcgraw
got
an
idea
as
he
frequently
does
bowerman
went
out
that
afternoon
and
made
four
hits
out
of
a
possible
five
the
next
day
three
or
four
more
of
the
players
came
into
the
park
carrying
smiles
and
the
announcement
that
fortunately
they
too
had
met
a
load
of
empty
barrels
they
then
all
went
out
and
regained
their
old
batting
strides
and
we
won
that
afternoon
for
the
first
time
in
a
week
more
saw
a
load
of
barrels
the
next
day
and
started
to
bat
at
last
all
the
members
of
the
team
had
met
the
barrels
and
men
with
averages
of
were
threatening
to
chisel
into
the
set
with
remarkable
regularity
the
players
were
meeting
loads
of
empty
barrels
on
their
way
to
the
park
and
with
remarkable
regularity
and
a
great
deal
of
expedition
the
pitchers
of
opposing
clubs
were
being
driven
to
the
shower
bath
say
asked
billy
gilbert
the
old
second
baseman
of
bill
lauder
formerly
the
protector
of
the
third
corner
one
day
is
one
of
that
team
of
horses
sorrel
and
the
other
white
sure
answered
bill
sure
echoed
mcgraw
i
hired
that
load
of
empty
barrels
by
the
week
to
drive
around
and
meet
you
fellows
on
the
way
to
the
park
and
you
think
i
can
afford
to
have
them
change
horses
every
day
do
you
everybody
had
a
good
laugh
and
kept
on
swatting
mcgraw
asked
for
waivers
on
the
load
of
empty
barrels
soon
afterwards
but
his
scheme
had
stopped
a
batting
slump
and
put
the
club
hitters
on
their
feet
again
he
plays
to
the
little
personal
qualities
and
superstitions
in
the
men
to
get
the
most
out
of
them
and
just
seeing
those
barrels
gave
them
the
idea
that
they
were
bound
to
get
the
base
hits
and
they
got
them
once
more
the
old
confidence
hitched
up
with
ability
what
manager
would
have
carried
a
kansas
farmer
around
the
circuit
with
him
besides
mcgraw
i
refer
to
charles
victor
faust
of
marion
kansas
the
most
famous
jinx
killer
of
them
all
faust
first
met
the
giants
in
louis
on
the
next
to
the
last
trip
the
club
made
west
in
the
season
of
when
he
wandered
into
the
planter
hotel
one
day
asked
for
mcgraw
and
announced
that
a
fortune
teller
of
marion
had
informed
him
he
would
be
a
great
pitcher
and
that
for
he
could
have
a
full
reading
this
pitching
announcement
piqued
charles
and
he
reached
down
into
his
jeans
dug
out
his
last
five
and
passed
it
over
the
fortune
teller
informed
faust
that
all
he
had
to
do
to
get
into
the
headlines
of
the
newspapers
and
to
be
a
great
pitcher
was
to
join
the
new
york
giants
he
joined
and
after
he
once
joined
it
would
have
taken
the
mcnamaras
in
their
best
form
to
separate
him
from
the
said
giants
charley
came
out
to
the
ball
park
and
amused
himself
warming
up
incidentally
the
giants
did
not
lose
a
game
while
he
was
in
the
neighborhood
the
night
the
club
left
for
chicago
on
that
trip
he
was
down
at
the
union
station
ready
to
go
along
did
you
get
your
contract
and
transportation
asked
mcgraw
as
the
lanky
kansan
appeared
no
answered
charley
pshaw
replied
mcgraw
i
left
it
for
you
with
the
clerk
at
the
hotel
the
train
leaves
in
two
minutes
he
continued
glancing
at
his
watch
if
you
can
run
the
way
you
say
you
can
you
can
make
it
and
be
back
in
time
to
catch
it
it
was
the
last
we
saw
of
charley
faust
for
a
time
galloping
up
the
platform
in
his
angular
way
with
that
contract
and
transportation
in
sight
i
almost
sorry
we
left
him
remarked
mcgraw
as
charley
disappeared
in
the
crowd
we
played
on
around
the
circuit
with
indifferent
luck
and
got
back
to
new
york
with
the
pennant
no
more
than
a
possibility
and
rather
a
remote
one
at
that
the
first
day
we
were
in
new
york
charley
faust
entered
the
clubhouse
with
several
inches
of
dust
and
mud
caked
on
him
for
he
had
come
all
the
way
either
by
special
or
blind
baggage
i
here
all
right
he
announced
quietly
and
started
to
climb
into
a
uniform
i
see
you
are
answered
mcgraw
charley
stuck
around
for
two
or
three
days
and
we
won
then
mcgraw
decided
he
would
have
to
be
dropped
and
ordered
the
man
on
the
door
of
the
clubhouse
to
bar
this
kansas
kid
out
faust
broke
down
and
cried
that
day
and
we
lost
after
that
he
became
a
member
of
the
club
and
we
won
game
after
game
until
some
busy
newspaper
man
obtained
a
vaudeville
engagement
for
him
at
a
salary
of
a
week
we
lost
three
games
the
week
he
was
absent
from
the
grounds
and
faust
saw
at
once
he
was
not
doing
the
right
thing
by
the
club
so
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
that
would
have
gone
with
morgan
income
he
passed
up
some
lucrative
vaudeville
contracts
much
to
the
disgust
of
the
newspaper
man
who
was
cutting
the
remuneration
with
him
and
settled
down
to
business
the
club
did
not
lose
a
game
after
that
and
it
was
decided
to
take
faust
west
with
us
on
the
last
and
famous
trip
in
daily
he
had
been
bothering
mcgraw
and
brush
for
his
contract
for
he
wanted
to
pitch
the
club
paid
him
some
money
from
time
to
time
to
meet
his
personal
expenses
the
sunday
night
the
club
left
for
boston
a
vaudeville
agent
was
at
the
grand
central
station
with
a
contract
offering
faust
a
week
for
five
weeks
which
charley
refused
in
order
to
stick
with
the
club
it
was
the
greatest
trip
away
from
home
in
the
history
of
baseball
starting
with
the
pennant
almost
out
of
reach
the
giants
won
eighteen
and
lost
four
games
one
contest
that
we
dropped
in
louis
was
when
some
of
the
newspaper
correspondents
on
the
trip
kidnapped
faust
and
sat
him
on
the
louis
bench
another
day
in
louis
the
game
had
gone
eleven
innings
and
the
cardinals
needed
one
run
to
win
they
had
several
incipient
scores
on
the
bases
and
rube
marquard
in
the
box
was
apparently
going
up
in
the
air
only
one
was
out
faust
was
warming
up
far
in
the
suburbs
when
under
orders
from
mcgraw
i
ran
out
and
sent
him
to
the
bench
for
that
was
the
place
from
which
his
charm
seemed
to
be
the
most
potent
charley
came
loping
to
the
bench
as
fast
as
his
long
legs
would
transport
him
and
louis
did
score
and
we
won
the
game
it
was
as
nice
a
piece
of
pinch
mascoting
as
i
ever
saw
the
first
two
games
that
charley
really
lost
were
in
chicago
and
all
through
the
trip
he
reiterated
his
weird
prophecies
that
the
giants
with
manager
mcgraw
were
goin
ta
win
the
players
believed
in
him
and
none
would
have
let
him
go
if
it
had
been
necessary
to
support
him
out
of
their
own
pockets
and
we
did
win
charley
with
his
monologue
and
great
good
humor
kept
the
players
in
high
spirits
throughout
the
journey
and
the
feeling
prevailed
that
we
could
lose
with
him
along
he
was
advertised
all
over
the
circuit
and
spectators
were
going
to
the
ball
park
to
see
faust
and
wagner
charley
admitted
that
he
could
fan
out
hans
because
he
had
learned
how
to
pitch
out
there
in
kansas
by
correspondence
school
and
had
read
of
hans
weakness
in
a
book
his
one
groove
was
massages
and
manicures
he
would
go
into
the
barber
shop
with
any
member
of
the
team
who
happened
to
be
getting
shaved
and
take
a
massage
and
manicure
for
the
purposes
of
sociability
as
a
man
takes
a
drink
he
easily
was
the
record
holder
for
the
manicure
marathon
hanging
up
the
figures
of
five
in
one
day
in
louis
he
also
liked
pie
for
breakfast
dinner
and
supper
and
a
small
half
before
retiring
but
alas
charley
lost
in
the
world
series
he
could
make
good
and
a
jinx
killer
never
comes
back
he
is
gone
and
his
expansive
smile
and
slide
are
gone
with
him
that
is
mcgraw
hopes
he
is
gone
but
he
was
a
wonder
while
he
had
it
and
he
did
a
great
deal
toward
giving
the
players
confidence
with
him
on
the
bench
they
thought
they
could
lose
and
they
could
it
has
long
been
a
superstition
among
that
when
a
bug
joins
a
club
it
will
win
a
championship
and
the
giants
believed
it
when
charley
faust
arrived
did
charley
faust
win
the
championship
for
the
giants
another
superstition
among
is
that
no
one
must
say
to
a
pitcher
as
he
goes
to
the
box
for
the
eighth
inning
come
on
now
only
six
more
men
or
for
the
ninth
pitch
hard
now
only
three
left
ames
says
that
he
lost
a
game
in
louis
once
because
mcgraw
forgot
himself
and
urged
him
to
pitch
hard
because
only
three
remained
to
be
put
out
those
three
batters
raised
the
mischief
with
ames
prospects
he
was
knocked
out
of
the
box
in
that
last
inning
and
we
lost
the
game
that
was
before
the
days
of
the
wonder
necktie
ames
won
the
third
game
played
in
chicago
on
the
last
trip
west
coming
into
the
ninth
inning
he
had
the
cubs
beaten
when
mcgraw
began
come
on
only
nix
mac
cut
in
ames
for
the
love
of
mike
be
reasonable
and
then
he
won
the
game
but
the
chances
are
that
if
mcgraw
had
got
that
only
three
more
out
he
would
have
lost
because
it
would
have
been
working
on
his
strained
nerves
xii
base
runners
and
how
they
help
a
pitcher
to
win
secret
of
successful
base
running
is
getting
the
start
a
club
composed
of
good
base
runners
is
likely
to
do
more
to
help
a
pitcher
win
games
than
a
batting
order
of
hard
hitters
stealing
second
is
an
art
in
taking
chances
the
giants
stole
their
way
to
a
pennant
but
connie
mack
stopped
the
grand
larceny
when
it
came
to
a
many
times
have
the
crowds
at
the
polo
grounds
seen
a
man
get
on
first
base
in
a
close
game
and
with
the
pitcher
motion
start
to
steal
second
only
to
have
the
catcher
throw
him
out
the
spectators
groan
and
criticise
the
manager
why
did
he
wait
for
the
hitters
to
bat
him
around
is
the
cry
then
again
a
man
starts
for
the
base
times
his
just
right
and
slides
into
the
bag
in
a
cloud
of
dust
while
the
umpire
spreads
out
his
hands
indicating
that
he
is
safe
the
crowd
cheers
and
proclaims
mcgraw
a
great
manager
and
the
stealer
a
great
base
runner
maybe
the
next
batter
comes
along
with
a
hit
and
the
runner
scores
it
wins
the
game
and
mention
is
made
in
the
newspapers
the
next
morning
of
the
fast
base
running
of
the
club
a
man
has
covered
ninety
feet
of
ground
while
the
ball
is
travelling
from
the
pitcher
to
the
catcher
and
back
to
the
fielder
who
is
guarding
second
base
it
is
the
most
important
ninety
feet
in
baseball
from
second
base
just
one
hit
scores
the
runner
stealing
second
one
of
the
most
picturesque
plays
of
the
game
is
the
gentle
art
of
taking
a
chance
in
the
giants
stole
more
bases
than
any
other
big
league
club
has
had
to
its
credit
since
the
pirates
established
the
record
in
devore
snodgrass
murray
merkle
and
doyle
once
they
got
on
the
bases
were
like
loose
mercury
they
could
be
caught
and
mcgraw
stole
his
way
to
a
pennant
with
this
quintet
of
runners
not
alone
because
of
the
number
of
bases
they
pilfered
but
because
of
the
edge
it
gave
the
giants
on
the
rest
of
the
clubs
with
the
men
with
reputations
on
the
team
i
should
say
that
holding
these
runners
up
on
the
bases
and
worrying
about
what
they
were
going
to
do
reduced
the
efficiency
of
opposing
pitchers
it
was
the
speed
of
the
men
that
accounted
for
the
record
a
sprinter
may
get
into
the
big
league
and
never
steal
a
base
but
it
was
the
mcgraw
system
combined
with
their
natural
ability
get
the
start
reiterates
mcgraw
half
of
base
stealing
is
leaving
the
bag
at
the
right
time
know
when
you
have
a
good
lead
and
then
never
stop
until
you
have
hit
the
dirt
it
is
up
to
the
pitcher
as
much
as
the
catcher
to
stop
base
stealing
for
once
a
club
begins
running
wild
on
another
the
bats
might
as
well
be
packed
up
and
the
game
conceded
pitchers
make
a
study
of
the
individual
runners
and
their
styles
of
getting
starts
in
my
mind
i
know
just
how
much
of
a
lead
every
base
runner
in
the
national
league
can
take
on
me
with
impunity
bob
bescher
of
the
cincinnati
club
was
the
leading
bright
particular
star
of
the
national
league
in
the
season
of
and
the
secret
of
his
success
was
in
his
start
he
tries
to
get
as
big
a
lead
as
possible
with
each
pitch
and
then
when
he
intends
to
leave
edges
a
couple
of
feet
farther
than
usual
catching
the
pitcher
unawares
with
the
two
extra
feet
bescher
is
bound
to
get
to
second
base
at
the
same
time
as
the
ball
and
no
catcher
in
the
world
can
stop
him
therefore
it
is
up
to
the
pitcher
to
keep
him
from
getting
this
start
the
two
more
feet
he
seeks
i
know
that
bescher
can
take
ten
feet
from
the
bag
when
i
am
pitching
and
get
back
safely
but
i
am
equally
sure
that
if
he
makes
his
lead
twelve
feet
and
i
notice
it
i
can
probably
catch
him
as
a
good
ribbon
salesman
constantly
has
in
his
mind
eye
the
answer
to
the
question
how
far
is
a
yard
so
i
know
at
a
glance
exactly
how
far
bescher
can
lead
and
get
back
safely
when
he
is
on
first
base
if
i
glance
over
and
see
him
twelve
feet
away
from
the
bag
and
about
to
start
i
turn
and
throw
and
catch
him
the
crowd
laughs
at
him
and
says
bescher
asleep
at
the
switch
again
the
real
truth
is
that
bescher
was
not
asleep
but
trying
to
get
that
old
jump
which
would
have
meant
the
stolen
base
again
he
takes
the
twelve
feet
and
i
do
perceive
it
he
gets
started
with
my
arm
and
goes
into
the
bag
ahead
of
the
ball
great
base
runner
comments
the
fickle
crowd
bescher
has
only
accomplished
what
he
was
trying
to
do
before
but
he
has
gotten
away
with
it
this
time
being
a
great
is
the
gentle
art
of
getting
away
with
it
spectators
often
wonder
why
a
pitcher
wearies
them
with
throwing
over
to
the
first
base
many
times
when
it
is
plain
to
see
that
he
has
no
chance
of
catching
his
quarry
bill
dahlen
used
to
be
one
of
the
best
men
in
the
game
for
getting
back
in
some
way
when
on
base
employing
a
straddle
slide
and
just
hooking
the
bag
with
his
toe
leaving
a
to
touch
the
result
was
that
he
was
always
handing
the
pitcher
the
laugh
as
he
brushed
himself
off
for
none
can
say
dahlen
was
not
an
immaculate
but
the
pitchers
found
out
that
they
could
tire
dahlen
out
by
repeatedly
throwing
over
to
the
bag
and
that
after
five
throws
which
required
five
dashes
and
slides
back
to
the
base
he
was
all
in
and
could
not
steal
because
he
did
have
the
physical
strength
left
thus
as
soon
as
dahlen
got
on
a
pitcher
began
throwing
over
until
he
had
him
tired
out
and
then
he
pitched
to
the
batter
so
bill
crossed
them
by
living
on
the
bag
until
he
thought
he
saw
his
opportunity
to
get
the
jump
and
then
he
would
try
to
steal
few
good
base
runners
watch
the
ball
after
they
have
once
left
the
bag
they
look
at
the
baseman
to
see
how
he
is
playing
and
make
the
slide
accordingly
if
devore
sees
huggins
of
louis
behind
the
base
he
slides
in
front
and
pulls
his
body
away
from
the
bag
so
that
he
leaves
the
smallest
possible
area
to
touch
if
he
observes
the
baseman
cutting
inside
to
block
him
off
he
goes
behind
and
hooks
it
with
just
one
toe
again
presenting
the
minimum
touching
surface
if
the
ball
is
hit
while
the
runner
is
en
route
he
takes
one
quick
glance
at
the
coacher
on
the
third
base
line
and
can
tell
by
his
motions
whether
to
turn
back
or
to
continue
mcgraw
devotes
half
his
time
and
energy
in
the
spring
to
teaching
his
men
base
running
and
the
art
of
sliding
which
when
highly
cultivated
means
being
there
with
one
toe
and
somewhere
else
with
the
rest
of
the
body
but
most
of
all
he
impresses
on
the
athletes
the
necessity
of
getting
the
start
before
making
the
attempt
to
steal
as
long
as
i
live
i
shall
believe
that
if
snodgrass
had
known
he
had
the
jump
in
the
third
game
of
the
world
series
in
when
he
really
had
it
and
if
he
had
taken
advantage
of
it
we
would
have
won
the
game
and
possibly
the
championship
it
was
in
the
contest
that
baker
balanced
by
banging
the
home
run
into
the
right
field
bleachers
in
the
ninth
inning
when
i
was
pitching
that
tied
the
score
to
for
nine
innings
i
had
been
pitching
myself
out
putting
everything
that
i
had
on
every
ball
because
the
team
gave
me
no
lead
to
rest
on
when
baker
pushed
that
ball
into
the
bleachers
with
only
two
more
men
to
get
out
to
win
the
game
i
was
all
in
but
i
managed
to
live
through
the
tenth
with
very
little
on
the
ball
and
we
came
to
the
bat
snodgrass
got
a
base
on
balls
and
journeyed
to
second
on
a
sacrifice
he
was
taking
a
big
lead
off
the
middle
base
with
the
pitcher
motion
and
running
back
before
the
catcher
got
the
ball
because
a
quick
throw
would
have
caught
him
it
was
bad
baseball
but
he
was
nervous
with
the
intense
strain
and
to
score
then
came
the
time
when
he
took
a
longer
lead
than
any
other
and
lapp
the
athletics
catcher
seeing
him
was
sure
he
was
going
to
steal
and
in
his
hurry
to
get
the
ball
away
and
save
the
game
let
it
past
him
snodgrass
had
the
jump
and
probably
would
have
made
the
base
had
he
kept
on
going
but
he
had
no
orders
to
steal
and
had
turned
and
taken
a
step
or
two
back
toward
second
when
he
saw
lapp
lose
the
ball
again
he
turned
and
retraced
his
steps
and
i
never
saw
a
man
turn
so
slowly
simply
because
i
realized
how
important
a
turn
that
was
going
to
be
next
i
looked
at
lapp
and
saw
him
picking
up
the
ball
which
had
rolled
only
about
three
feet
behind
him
he
snapped
it
to
third
and
had
snodgrass
by
several
feet
snodgrass
realized
this
as
he
plunged
down
the
base
line
but
he
could
not
stop
and
permit
himself
to
be
tagged
and
he
could
not
go
back
so
he
made
that
historic
slide
which
was
heard
almost
around
the
world
cut
off
several
yards
of
frank
baker
trousers
and
more
important
than
the
damage
to
the
uniform
lost
us
the
game
snodgrass
had
the
jump
in
his
first
start
and
if
he
had
kept
right
on
going
he
would
have
made
the
bag
without
the
aid
of
the
passed
ball
in
my
opinion
but
he
did
not
know
that
he
had
this
advantage
and
was
on
his
way
back
when
it
looked
for
a
minute
as
if
the
athletics
catcher
had
made
a
mistake
this
really
turned
out
to
be
the
break
in
the
game
for
it
was
on
that
passed
ball
that
snodgrass
was
put
out
he
would
probably
have
scored
the
run
which
would
have
won
the
game
had
he
lived
either
on
second
or
third
base
for
a
hit
followed
after
losing
the
contest
after
watching
the
opportunity
thrown
away
some
fan
called
me
on
the
telephone
that
night
when
i
was
feeling
in
anything
but
a
conversational
mood
and
asked
me
was
that
passed
ball
this
afternoon
part
of
the
athletics
inside
game
did
lapp
do
it
on
purpose
in
passing
i
want
to
put
in
a
word
for
snodgrass
not
because
he
is
a
of
mine
but
on
account
of
the
criticism
which
he
received
for
spiking
baker
and
which
was
not
deserved
and
in
that
word
i
do
not
want
to
detract
from
baker
reputation
a
scintilla
if
i
could
for
he
is
a
great
but
i
want
to
say
that
if
john
murray
had
ever
been
called
upon
to
slide
into
that
bag
with
baker
playing
it
as
he
did
baker
would
probably
have
been
found
cut
in
halves
and
only
murray
own
style
of
coasting
would
have
been
responsible
for
it
if
fred
clarke
of
pittsburg
had
been
the
man
coming
in
baker
would
probably
have
been
neatly
cut
into
thirds
one
third
with
each
foot
clarke
is
known
as
one
of
the
most
wicked
sliders
in
the
national
league
he
jumps
into
the
air
and
spreads
his
feet
apart
showing
his
spikes
as
he
comes
in
the
giants
were
playing
in
pittsburg
several
years
ago
before
i
was
married
and
there
was
a
friend
of
mine
at
the
ball
park
with
whom
i
was
particularly
eager
to
make
a
hit
the
game
was
close
as
are
all
contests
which
lend
themselves
readily
to
an
anecdote
and
clarke
got
as
far
as
third
base
in
the
eighth
inning
with
the
score
tied
and
two
out
warner
the
giants
catcher
let
one
get
past
him
and
i
ran
in
to
cover
the
plate
clarke
came
digging
for
home
and
as
i
turned
to
touch
him
he
slid
and
cut
my
trousers
off
never
touching
my
legs
it
was
small
consolation
to
me
that
my
stems
were
still
whole
and
that
the
umpire
had
called
clarke
out
and
that
the
game
was
yet
saved
my
love
for
my
art
is
keen
but
it
stops
at
a
certain
point
and
that
point
is
where
i
have
to
send
a
hurry
call
for
a
barrel
and
the
team
tailor
the
players
made
a
sort
of
group
around
me
while
i
did
my
lady
godiva
act
from
the
plate
to
the
bench
murray
has
the
ideal
slide
for
a
base
gatherer
but
one
which
commands
the
respect
of
all
the
guardians
of
the
sacks
in
the
national
league
when
about
eight
feet
from
the
bag
he
jumps
into
the
air
giving
the
fielder
a
vision
of
two
sets
of
nicely
honed
spikes
aimed
for
the
base
as
murray
hits
the
bag
he
comes
up
on
his
feet
and
is
in
a
position
to
start
for
the
next
station
in
case
of
any
fumble
or
slip
he
is
a
great
man
to
use
this
slide
to
advantage
against
young
players
who
are
inclined
to
be
timid
when
they
see
those
spikes
it
all
part
of
the
game
as
it
is
played
in
the
large
leagues
the
boston
team
was
trying
out
a
young
player
two
years
ago
murray
remarked
to
mcgraw
before
the
game
the
first
time
i
get
on
i
bet
i
can
make
that
fellow
fumble
and
pick
up
an
extra
base
theatre
tickets
for
the
crowd
on
saturday
night
inquired
mcgraw
you
said
it
answered
murray
along
about
the
second
or
third
inning
john
walked
and
started
for
second
on
the
first
ball
pitched
the
busher
came
in
to
cover
the
base
and
murray
leaped
clear
of
the
ground
and
yelled
look
out
the
newcomer
evidently
thought
that
murray
had
lost
control
of
his
legs
got
one
look
at
those
spikes
and
bent
all
his
energies
toward
dodging
them
paying
no
attention
whatever
to
the
ball
which
continued
its
unmolested
journey
to
centre
field
the
new
man
proved
to
be
one
of
the
best
little
dodgers
i
ever
saw
john
was
in
a
perfect
position
to
start
and
went
along
to
third
at
his
leisure
did
i
call
the
turn
murray
yelled
at
mcgraw
as
he
came
to
the
bench
what
show
do
you
want
to
see
asked
mcgraw
but
on
an
old
campaigner
this
show
of
spikes
has
no
effect
whatever
the
capable
basemen
in
the
league
know
how
to
cover
the
bag
so
as
to
get
the
runner
out
and
still
give
him
room
to
come
in
without
hurting
any
one
in
spite
of
an
impression
that
prevails
to
the
contrary
never
spike
a
man
on
purpose
at
present
i
do
believe
there
is
a
runner
in
the
national
league
who
would
cut
down
another
man
if
he
had
the
opportunity
if
one
man
does
spike
another
accidentally
he
is
heartily
sorry
and
often
such
an
event
affects
his
own
playing
and
his
base
running
ability
the
slide
is
now
more
in
vogue
in
the
big
leagues
than
the
old
coast
and
i
attribute
this
to
two
causes
one
is
that
the
show
of
the
spikes
is
a
sort
of
assurance
the
base
runner
is
going
to
have
room
to
come
into
the
bag
and
the
second
is
that
the
great
amount
of
armor
which
a
catcher
wears
in
these
latter
days
makes
some
such
formidable
slide
necessary
when
coming
into
the
plate
if
a
base
runner
hits
a
catcher
squarely
with
his
shin
guards
on
he
is
likely
to
be
badly
injured
and
he
must
be
sure
that
the
catcher
is
going
to
give
him
a
clear
path
some
catchers
block
off
the
plate
so
that
a
man
has
got
to
shoot
his
spikes
at
them
to
get
through
and
i
not
saying
that
it
bad
catching
because
that
is
the
way
to
keep
a
man
from
scoring
make
him
go
around
if
possible
but
the
game
has
changed
in
the
last
few
years
as
far
as
intentional
spiking
goes
many
a
time
when
i
first
started
with
the
giants
i
heard
a
base
runner
shout
at
a
fielder
get
out
of
the
way
there
or
i
cut
you
in
two
and
he
would
not
have
hesitated
to
do
it
either
that
was
part
of
the
game
but
nowadays
if
a
player
got
the
reputation
of
cutting
men
down
and
putting
star
players
out
of
the
game
intentionally
he
would
soon
be
driven
out
of
the
league
probably
on
a
stretcher
when
john
hummel
of
the
brooklyn
club
spiked
doyle
in
and
greatly
lessened
the
giants
chances
of
winning
the
pennant
which
the
club
ultimately
lost
he
came
around
to
our
clubhouse
after
the
game
and
inquired
for
larry
when
he
found
how
badly
doyle
was
cut
he
was
as
broken
up
as
any
member
of
our
team
if
i
known
i
was
goin
to
cut
you
larry
i
would
have
slid
he
said
that
all
right
answered
doyle
i
guess
i
was
blockin
you
do
say
much
in
a
situation
of
that
kind
but
each
one
who
witnessed
the
incident
knew
that
when
doyle
doubled
down
spiked
most
of
our
chances
of
the
pennant
went
down
with
him
for
it
broke
up
the
infield
of
the
team
at
a
most
important
moment
it
takes
some
time
for
a
new
part
to
work
into
a
clock
so
that
it
keeps
perfect
time
again
no
matter
how
delicate
is
the
workmanship
of
the
new
part
so
the
best
infielder
takes
time
to
fit
into
the
infield
of
a
big
league
club
and
have
it
hit
on
all
four
cylinders
again
fred
merkle
is
one
of
the
few
who
still
prefers
the
slide
and
he
sticks
to
it
only
on
certain
occasions
he
is
the
best
man
to
steal
third
base
playing
ball
he
declares
that
when
he
is
going
into
the
bag
he
can
see
better
by
shooting
his
head
first
and
that
he
can
swing
his
body
away
from
the
base
and
just
hook
it
with
one
finger
nail
leaving
just
that
to
touch
and
he
keeps
his
nails
clipped
short
in
the
season
so
that
there
is
very
little
exposed
to
which
the
ball
can
be
applied
if
he
sees
that
the
third
baseman
is
playing
inside
the
bag
he
goes
behind
it
and
hooks
it
with
his
finger
and
if
the
man
is
playing
back
he
cuts
through
in
front
pulling
his
body
away
from
the
play
but
the
common
or
garden
variety
of
player
will
take
the
hook
slide
feet
first
because
he
can
catch
the
bag
with
one
leg
and
the
feet
as
tender
a
portion
of
the
anatomy
to
be
roughly
touched
as
the
head
and
shoulders
a
club
of
base
runners
will
do
more
to
help
a
pitcher
win
than
a
batting
order
of
hard
hitters
i
believe
speed
is
the
great
thing
in
the
baseball
of
by
speed
i
do
not
mean
that
good
men
must
be
sprinters
alone
they
must
be
fast
starters
fast
runners
and
fast
thinkers
remember
that
last
one
fast
thinkers
harry
mccormick
formerly
the
on
the
giants
when
he
joined
the
club
before
his
legs
began
to
go
bad
was
a
sprinter
one
of
the
fastest
men
who
ever
broke
into
the
league
before
he
took
up
baseball
as
a
profession
he
had
been
a
runner
in
college
but
mccormick
was
never
a
brilliant
base
stealer
because
he
could
not
get
the
start
when
a
man
is
pitching
for
a
club
of
base
runners
he
knows
that
every
time
a
player
with
a
stealing
reputation
gets
on
and
there
is
an
outside
chance
of
his
scoring
the
run
is
going
to
be
hung
up
the
tallies
give
a
pitcher
confidence
to
proceed
then
when
the
club
has
the
reputation
of
possessing
a
great
bunch
of
base
runners
the
other
pitcher
is
worried
all
the
time
and
has
to
devote
about
half
his
energies
to
watching
the
bases
this
makes
him
easier
to
hit
but
put
a
hard
hitter
who
is
a
slow
base
runner
on
the
club
and
he
does
little
good
there
used
to
be
a
man
on
the
giants
named
charley
hickman
who
played
third
base
and
then
the
outfield
he
was
one
of
the
best
natural
hitters
who
ever
wormed
his
way
into
baseball
but
when
he
got
on
the
bases
were
blocked
he
could
not
run
and
it
took
a
hit
to
advance
him
a
base
get
a
fast
man
on
behind
him
and
because
the
rules
of
the
game
do
not
permit
one
runner
to
pass
another
it
was
like
having
a
freight
train
preceding
the
twentieth
century
limited
on
a
single
track
road
hickman
was
not
so
slow
when
he
first
started
but
after
a
while
his
legs
went
bad
and
his
weight
increased
so
that
he
was
built
like
a
box
car
to
carry
out
the
railroad
figure
hickman
finally
dropped
back
into
the
minor
leagues
and
continued
to
bat
three
hundred
but
he
had
to
lose
the
ball
to
make
the
journey
clear
around
the
bases
on
one
wallop
once
he
hit
the
old
flag
pole
in
centre
field
at
the
polo
grounds
on
the
fly
and
just
did
nose
the
ball
out
at
the
plate
it
was
a
record
hit
for
distance
at
last
while
still
maintaining
the
pace
hickman
was
dropped
by
the
toledo
club
of
the
american
association
why
did
you
let
charley
hickman
go
i
asked
the
manager
one
day
because
he
was
tyin
up
traffic
on
the
bases
he
replied
merkle
is
not
a
particularly
fast
runner
but
he
is
a
great
base
stealer
because
he
has
acquired
the
knack
of
getting
away
he
never
tries
to
steal
until
he
has
his
start
he
is
also
a
good
arriver
as
i
have
pointed
out
it
was
like
getting
a
steamroller
in
motion
to
start
hickman
clever
and
managers
are
always
trying
to
evolve
new
tactics
that
will
puzzle
the
other
team
but
there
ai
no
new
stuff
it
is
a
case
of
digging
up
the
old
ones
pitchers
are
also
earnest
in
their
endeavors
to
discover
improved
ways
to
stop
base
running
merkle
and
i
worked
out
a
play
during
the
spring
training
season
in
which
caught
perhaps
a
dozen
men
off
first
base
before
the
other
teams
began
to
watch
for
the
trick
and
it
was
not
original
with
me
i
got
the
idea
from
patsy
flaherty
a
boston
pitcher
who
has
his
salary
wing
fastened
to
his
left
side
flaherty
would
pitch
over
to
first
base
quickly
and
the
fielder
would
shoot
the
ball
back
then
flaherty
would
pop
one
through
to
the
batter
often
catching
him
off
his
guard
and
sneaking
a
strike
over
besides
leaving
the
runner
flat
on
the
ground
in
the
position
in
which
he
had
been
when
he
slid
back
to
the
bag
if
the
batter
hit
the
ball
the
runner
was
in
no
attitude
to
get
a
start
and
on
an
infield
tap
it
was
easy
to
make
a
double
play
the
next
time
that
the
man
got
on
base
flaherty
would
shoot
the
ball
over
to
first
as
before
and
the
runner
would
be
up
on
his
feet
and
away
from
the
bag
expecting
him
to
throw
it
to
the
plate
but
as
the
first
baseman
whipped
it
back
quickly
flaherty
returned
the
ball
and
the
runner
was
caught
flat
footed
and
made
to
look
foolish
do
certainly
hate
to
appear
ridiculous
and
the
laugh
from
the
crowd
upsets
a
big
leaguer
more
than
anything
else
even
a
call
from
mcgraw
because
the
crowd
can
not
hear
that
and
does
not
know
the
man
is
looking
foolish
it
was
almost
impossible
to
steal
bases
on
patsy
flaherty
because
he
had
the
men
hugging
the
bag
all
the
time
and
if
he
had
had
other
essentials
of
a
pitcher
he
would
have
been
a
great
one
he
even
lived
in
the
big
league
for
some
time
with
this
quick
throw
as
his
only
asset
i
adopted
the
flaherty
movement
but
it
is
harder
for
a
to
use
as
he
is
not
in
such
a
good
position
to
whip
the
ball
to
the
bag
merkle
and
i
rehearsed
it
in
spring
practice
as
soon
as
a
man
got
on
first
base
i
popped
the
ball
over
to
merkle
and
without
even
making
a
stab
at
the
runner
he
shot
it
to
me
then
back
again
just
as
the
runner
had
let
go
of
the
bag
and
was
getting
up
the
theoretical
result
he
was
caught
sometimes
it
worked
then
they
began
to
play
for
me
another
play
on
which
the
changes
have
often
been
rung
is
the
double
steal
with
men
on
first
and
third
bases
that
is
mcgraw
favorite
situation
in
a
crisis
somebody
got
to
look
foolish
on
the
play
says
mac
and
i
want
to
furnish
any
laughs
the
old
way
to
work
it
was
to
have
the
man
on
first
start
for
second
as
if
he
were
going
to
make
a
straight
steal
then
as
soon
as
the
catcher
drew
his
arm
back
to
throw
the
runner
on
third
started
home
no
big
league
club
can
have
a
look
into
the
pennant
set
without
trying
to
interrupt
the
journey
of
that
man
going
to
second
in
a
tight
place
because
if
no
play
is
made
for
him
and
a
hit
follows
it
nets
the
club
two
runs
instead
of
one
most
teams
try
to
stop
this
play
by
having
the
shortstop
or
second
baseman
come
in
and
take
a
short
throw
and
if
the
man
on
third
breaks
for
home
the
receiver
of
the
ball
whips
it
back
if
both
throws
are
perfect
the
runner
is
caught
at
the
plate
but
the
catchers
found
that
certain
clubs
were
making
this
play
in
routine
fashion
the
runner
on
first
starting
with
the
pitch
and
the
one
on
third
making
his
break
just
as
soon
as
the
catcher
drew
back
his
arm
then
the
backstops
began
making
a
bluff
throw
to
second
and
whipping
the
ball
to
third
often
getting
the
runner
by
several
feet
as
he
had
already
definitely
started
for
the
plate
tommy
leach
of
the
pittsburg
club
was
probably
caught
oftener
on
this
bluff
throw
than
any
other
man
in
baseball
for
some
time
he
had
been
making
the
play
against
clubs
which
used
the
short
throw
and
starting
as
the
catcher
drew
back
his
arm
as
that
was
the
only
chance
he
had
to
score
one
day
in
the
season
of
when
the
pirates
were
playing
against
the
giants
clarke
was
on
first
and
leach
on
third
with
one
run
required
to
balance
the
game
mcgraw
knew
the
double
steal
was
to
be
expected
as
two
were
out
bresnahan
was
aware
of
this
too
mcginnity
was
pitching
and
with
his
motion
clarke
got
his
start
bresnahan
drew
back
his
arm
as
if
to
throw
to
second
and
true
to
form
leach
was
on
his
way
to
the
plate
but
bresnahan
had
not
let
go
of
the
ball
and
he
shot
it
to
devlin
leach
being
run
down
in
the
base
line
and
the
pittsburg
club
eventually
losing
the
game
again
and
again
leach
fell
for
this
bluff
throw
until
the
news
spread
around
the
circuit
that
once
a
catcher
drew
back
his
arm
with
a
man
on
first
base
and
tommy
leach
on
third
there
would
be
no
holding
him
on
the
bag
he
was
caught
time
and
again
indeed
as
frequently
as
the
play
came
up
it
was
his
groove
he
could
not
be
stopped
from
making
his
break
at
last
clarke
had
to
order
him
to
abandon
the
play
until
he
could
cure
himself
of
this
habit
what
you
want
to
do
on
that
play
is
cross
is
mcgraw
theory
and
he
proceeded
to
develop
the
delayed
steal
with
this
intent
put
the
men
back
on
first
and
third
bases
thank
you
the
pitcher
has
the
ball
the
runner
on
first
intentionally
takes
too
large
a
lead
the
pitcher
throws
over
and
he
moves
a
few
steps
toward
second
then
a
few
more
all
that
time
the
man
on
third
is
edging
off
an
inch
two
inches
a
foot
the
first
baseman
turns
to
throw
to
second
to
stop
that
man
the
runner
on
third
plunges
for
the
plate
and
usually
gets
there
it
a
hard
one
to
stop
but
that
its
purpose
then
again
it
can
be
worked
after
the
catcher
gets
the
ball
the
runner
starts
from
first
slowly
and
the
catcher
hesitates
not
knowing
whether
to
throw
to
first
or
second
since
the
runner
did
not
start
with
the
pitch
theoretically
no
one
has
come
in
to
take
a
short
throw
and
the
play
can
not
be
made
back
to
the
plate
if
the
ball
is
thrown
to
second
this
form
of
the
play
is
usually
successful
miller
huggins
is
one
of
the
hardest
second
basemen
in
the
league
to
work
it
against
successfully
with
men
on
first
and
third
he
always
comes
in
for
the
short
throw
on
the
chance
and
covers
himself
up
after
we
had
stolen
our
way
to
a
pennant
in
the
national
league
in
the
season
of
and
after
our
five
leading
base
runners
had
been
mugged
by
the
police
in
louis
so
that
the
catchers
would
know
them
many
fans
expected
to
see
us
steal
a
world
championship
and
we
half
expected
it
ourselves
but
so
did
connie
mack
and
there
lies
the
answer
he
knew
our
strong
point
and
his
players
had
discussed
and
rehearsed
ways
and
means
to
break
up
our
game
mack
had
been
watching
the
giants
for
weeks
previous
to
the
series
and
had
had
his
spies
taking
notes
we
got
to
stop
them
running
bases
he
told
his
men
before
the
first
game
i
have
learned
since
and
they
did
guess
the
louis
police
must
have
sent
thomas
and
lapp
copies
of
those
pictures
mack
pitchers
cut
their
motions
down
to
nothing
with
men
on
the
bases
microscopic
motions
and
they
watched
the
runners
like
hawks
thomas
had
been
practising
to
get
the
men
the
first
time
that
devore
made
a
break
to
steal
he
was
caught
several
feet
from
the
bag
and
you
call
yourself
fast
commented
collins
as
he
threw
the
ball
back
to
the
pitcher
and
jogged
to
his
job
you
remind
me
of
a
cop
on
a
fixed
post
he
flung
over
his
shoulder
pitchers
have
a
great
deal
to
do
with
the
defensive
efficiency
of
the
club
if
they
do
not
hold
the
runners
up
the
best
catcher
in
the
world
can
not
stop
them
at
their
destination
that
is
the
reason
why
so
many
catchers
have
been
developed
by
the
chicago
cubs
the
team
has
always
had
a
good
pitching
staff
and
men
like
overall
brown
and
reulbach
force
the
runners
to
stick
to
the
oases
of
safety
the
giants
stole
their
way
to
a
pennant
in
and
it
was
on
account
of
the
speedy
material
but
because
mcgraw
had
spent
days
teaching
his
men
to
slide
and
emphasizing
the
necessity
of
getting
the
jump
then
he
picked
the
stages
of
the
game
when
the
attempts
to
steal
were
to
be
made
but
mcgraw
with
his
cast
of
thieves
was
stopped
in
the
series
by
one

notable
instances
where
the
inside
game
has
failed
inside
game
is
of
little
avail
when
a
batter
knocks
a
home
run
with
the
bases
full
many
times
the
strategies
of

opposing

doctored
their

cost
the

up
after
the

box
had

him
but
although
the
inside
game
sometimes
fails
no
manager
wants
a
player
who
will
steal

with
the
bases
there
is
an
old
story
about
an
altercation
which
took
place
during
a
wedding
ceremony
in
the
backwoods
of
the
virginia
mountains
the
discussion
started
over
the
propriety
of
the
best
man
holding
the
ring
and
by
the
time
that
it
had
been
finally
settled
the
bride
gazed
around
on
a
dead
bridegroom
a
dead
father
and
a
dead
best
man
not
to
mention
three
or
four
very
dead
ushers
and
a
clergyman
them
new
fangled
automatic
guns
has
sure
raised
hell
with
my
prospects
she
sighed
that
the
way
i
felt
when
john
franklin
baker
popped
that
home
run
into
the
stand
in
the
ninth
inning
of
the
third
game
of
the
world
series
with
one
man
already
out
for
eight
and
innings
the
giants
had
played
inside
ball
and
i
had
carefully
nursed
along
every
batter
who
came
to
the
plate
studying
his
weakness
and
pitching
at
it
it
looked
as
if
we
were
going
to
win
the
game
and
then
zing
and
also
zowie
the
ball
went
into
the
stand
on
a
line
and
i
looked
around
at
my
fielders
who
had
had
the
game
almost
within
their
grasp
a
minute
before
instantly
i
realized
that
i
had
been
pitching
myself
out
expecting
the
end
to
come
in
nine
innings
my
arm
felt
like
so
much
lead
hanging
to
my
side
after
that
hit
i
wanted
to
go
and
get
some
crape
and
hang
it
on
my
salary
whip
then
that
old
story
about
the
wedding
popped
into
my
head
and
i
said
to
myself
he
has
sure
raised
hell
with
your
prospects
sam
strang
the
official
pinch
hitter
of
the
giants
a
few
seasons
ago
was
one
of
the
best
in
the
business
mcgraw
sent
him
to
the
bat
in
the
ninth
inning
of
a
game
the
giants
were
playing
in
brooklyn
we
were
two
runs
behind
and
two
were
already
out
with
one
runner
on
the
bases
and
he
was
only
as
far
as
second
doc
scanlon
was
pitching
for
brooklyn
and
evidently
intimidated
by
sam
reputation
or
something
suddenly
became
wild
and
gave
the
giant
batter
three
balls
with
the
count
three
and
nothing
mcgraw
shouted
from
the
bench
wait
it
out
sam
but
sam
did
not
hear
him
and
he
took
a
nice
masculine
virile
swing
at
the
ball
and
fouled
it
out
of
the
reach
of
all
the
local
guardians
of
the
soil
are
you
deaf
barked
mcgraw
wait
it
out
i
tell
you
as
a
matter
of
fact
strang
was
a
little
deaf
and
did
not
hear
the
shouted
instructions
the
second
time
but
doc
scanlon
was
sensitive
as
to
hearing
and
feeling
sure
strang
would
obey
the
orders
of
mcgraw
thought
he
would
be
taking
no
chances
in
putting
the
next
ball
over
the
centre
of
the
plate
it
came
up
the
groove
and
strang
admired
it
as
it
approached
then
he
took
his
swing
and
the
next
place
the
ball
touched
was
in
the
italian
district
just
over
the
right
field
fence
the
hit
tied
the
score
mcgraw
met
strang
at
the
plate
and
instead
of
greeting
him
with
shouts
of
approbation
exclaimed
i
ought
to
fine
you
and
would
except
for
those
two
runs
and
the
few
points
difference
the
game
will
make
in
the
percentage
come
on
now
boys
let
win
this
one
and
we
did
in
the
eleventh
inning
that
was
a
case
of
the
inside
game
failing
any
big
league
pitcher
with
brains
would
have
laid
the
ball
over
after
hearing
mcgraw
shout
earnest
and
direct
orders
at
the
batter
to
wait
it
out
scanlon
was
playing
the
game
and
strang
was
not
but
it
broke
for
sam
it
was
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
he
ever
hit
the
ball
over
the
right
field
fence
in
brooklyn
and
he
has
never
done
it
since
if
he
had
not
been
lucky
in
connecting
with
that
ball
and
lifting
it
where
it
did
the
most
good
his
pay
envelope
would
have
been
lighter
by
at
the
end
of
the
month
and
he
would
have
obtained
an
accurate
idea
of
mcgraw
opinion
of
his
intellectuality
in
the
clubhouse
after
the
victory
mcgraw
said
honest
sam
why
did
you
swing
at
that
ball
after
i
had
told
you
not
to
i
did
hear
you
replied
strang
well
it
lucky
you
hit
it
where
they
were
answered
mcgraw
because
if
any
fielder
had
connected
with
the
ball
there
would
have
been
a
rough
greeting
waiting
for
you
on
the
bench
and
as
a
tip
sam
direct
from
me
you
got
away
with
it
once
but
do
try
it
again
it
was
bad
baseball
but
that
straight
one
looked
awful
good
to
me
coming
up
the
argued
sam
do
fall
for
all
the
good
lookers
sam
suggested
mcgraw
the
philosopher
strang
is
now
abroad
having
his
voice
cultivated
and
he
intends
to
enter
the
field
as
soon
as
he
can
finish
the
spring
training
in
paris
and
get
his
throat
into
shape
for
the
big
league
music
circuit
but
i
will
give
any
orchestra
leader
who
faces
sam
a
tip
if
he
does
want
him
to
come
in
strong
where
the
music
is
marked
rest
do
put
one
in
the
groove
because
strang
just
naturally
ca
help
swinging
at
it
he
is
a
poor
waiter
the
boston
club
lost
eighteen
straight
games
in
the
season
of
and
as
the
team
was
leaving
the
polo
grounds
after
having
dropped
four
in
a
row
making
the
eighteen
i
said
to
tenney
how
does
it
seem
fred
to
be
on
a
club
that
has
lost
eighteen
straight
it
what
general
sherman
said
war
is
replied
tenney
who
seldom
swears
but
for
entertainment
i
would
like
to
see
john
mcgraw
on
a
team
which
had
dropped
fifteen
or
sixteen
in
a
row
as
if
tenney
had
put
the
curse
on
us
the
giants
hit
a
losing
streak
the
next
day
that
totalled
six
games
straight
everything
that
we
tried
broke
against
us
mcgraw
would
attempt
the
double
steal
and
both
throws
would
be
accurate
and
the
runner
caught
at
the
plate
a
hit
and
a
run
sign
would
be
given
and
the
batter
would
run
up
against
a
mcgraw
was
slowly
going
crazy
all
his
pet
inside
tricks
were
worthless
he
the
king
of
baseball
clairvoyants
could
not
guess
right
it
began
to
look
to
me
as
if
tenney
would
get
his
entertainment
after
the
sixth
one
had
gone
against
us
and
mcgraw
had
not
spoken
a
friendly
word
to
any
one
for
a
week
he
called
the
players
around
him
in
the
clubhouse
i
ought
to
let
you
all
out
and
get
a
gang
of
boys
in
here
to
defend
the
civic
honor
of
this
great
and
growing
city
whose
municipal
pride
rests
on
your
shoulders
he
said
but
i
not
going
to
do
it
hereafter
we
will
cut
out
all
stuff
and
play
straight
baseball
every
man
will
go
up
there
and
hit
the
ball
just
as
you
see
it
done
on
the
lots
into
this
oration
was
mixed
a
judicious
amount
of
sulphur
the
cubs
had
just
taken
the
first
three
of
a
series
from
us
without
any
trouble
at
all
the
next
day
we
went
out
and
resorted
to
the
wallop
plain
untrimmed
slugging
tactics
and
beat
chicago
to
later
we
returned
to
the
cultivated
form
of
baseball
but
for
a
week
we
played
the
game
with
a
great
deal
of
success
it
changed
our
luck
another
method
which
has
upset
the
inside
game
of
many
visiting
teams
is
doping
the
grounds
the
first
time
in
my
baseball
career
that
i
ever
encountered
this
was
in
brooklyn
when
hanlon
was
the
manager
every
time
he
thought
i
was
going
to
pitch
there
he
would
have
the
diamond
doctored
for
me
in
the
morning
the
sank
the
pitcher
box
down
so
that
it
was
below
the
level
of
all
the
bases
instead
of
slightly
elevated
as
it
should
be
hanlon
knew
that
i
used
a
lot
of
speed
when
i
first
broke
into
the
league
getting
some
of
it
from
my
elevation
on
the
diamond
he
had
a
team
of
fast
men
who
depended
largely
on
a
bunting
game
and
their
speed
in
getting
to
first
base
to
win
with
me
fielding
bunts
out
of
the
hollow
they
had
a
better
chance
of
making
their
goal
then
pitching
from
the
lower
level
would
naturally
result
in
the
batters
getting
low
balls
because
i
would
be
more
apt
to
misjudge
the
elevation
of
the
plate
low
ones
were
made
to
bunt
finally
hanlon
always
put
into
the
box
to
work
against
me
a
little
pitcher
who
was
not
affected
as
much
as
i
by
the
topographical
changes
why
i
said
to
george
davis
the
giants
manager
the
first
time
i
pitched
out
of
the
cellar
which
in
brooklyn
was
regarded
as
the
box
i
throwing
from
a
hollow
instead
of
off
a
mound
sure
replied
davis
they
the
grounds
for
you
but
never
mind
when
we
are
entertaining
the
box
at
the
polo
grounds
will
be
built
up
the
days
you
are
going
to
pitch
against
brooklyn
and
you
can
burn
them
over
and
at
their
heads
if
you
like
the
thing
that
worried
the
athletics
most
before
the
last
world
series
was
the
reputation
of
the
giants
as
base
stealers
when
we
went
to
philadelphia
for
the
first
game
i
was
surprised
at
the
heavy
condition
of
the
base
lines
did
it
rain
here
last
night
i
inquired
from
a
native
no
he
answered
then
i
knew
that
the
lines
had
been
wet
down
to
slow
up
our
fast
runners
and
make
it
harder
for
them
to
steal
as
things
developed
this
precaution
was
unnecessary
but
it
was
an
effort
to
break
up
what
was
known
to
be
our
strongest
inside
play
baseball
men
maintain
that
the
acme
of
doctoring
grounds
was
the
work
of
the
old
baltimore
orioles
the
team
was
composed
of
fast
men
who
were
brilliant
bunters
and
hard
base
runners
the
soil
of
the
infield
was
mixed
with
a
form
of
clay
which
when
wet
and
then
rolled
was
almost
as
hard
as
concrete
the
ground
outside
the
first
and
third
base
lines
was
built
up
slightly
to
keep
well
placed
bunts
from
rolling
foul
while
toward
first
base
there
was
a
distinct
down
grade
to
aid
the
runner
in
reaching
that
station
with
all
possible
expedition
toward
second
there
was
a
gentle
slope
and
it
was
down
hill
to
third
but
coming
home
from
third
was
work
a
player
had
to
be
a
mountain
climber
to
make
it
this
all
benefited
fast
men
like
keeler
mcgraw
kelley
and
jennings
whose
most
dangerous
form
of
attack
was
the
bunt
the
orioles
did
not
stop
at
doctoring
the
infield
the
grass
in
the
outfield
was
permitted
to
grow
long
and
was
unkempt
centre
and
left
fields
were
kept
level
but
in
right
field
there
was
a
sharp
down
grade
to
aid
the
fast
keeler
he
had
made
an
exhaustive
study
of
all
the
possible
angles
at
which
the
ball
might
bound
and
had
certain
paths
that
he
followed
but
which
were
not
marked
out
by
sign
posts
for
visiting
he
was
sure
death
on
hits
to
his
territory
while
usually
wallops
got
past
visiting
and
so
great
was
the
grade
that
wee
willie
was
barely
visible
from
the
batter
box
a
hitting
team
coming
to
baltimore
would
be
forced
to
fall
into
the
bunting
game
or
be
entirely
outclassed
and
the
orioles
did
not
furnish
their
guests
with
topographical
maps
of
the
grounds
either
the
habit
of
doctoring
grounds
is
not
so
much
in
vogue
now
as
it
once
was
for
a
long
time
it
was
considered
fair
to
arrange
the
home
field
to
the
best
advantage
of
the
team
which
owned
it
for
otherwise
what
was
the
use
in
being
home
it
was
on
the
same
principle
that
a
general
builds
his
breastworks
to
best
suit
the
fighting
style
of
his
army
for
they
are
his
breastworks
but
lately
among
the
profession
sentiment
and
baseball
legislation
have
prevailed
against
the
doctoring
of
grounds
and
it
is
done
very
little
occasionally
a
pitching
box
is
raised
or
lowered
to
meet
the
requirements
of
a
certain
man
but
they
are
not
altered
every
day
to
fit
the
pitcher
as
they
once
were
such
tactics
often
hopelessly
upset
the
plan
of
battle
of
the
visiting
club
unless
this
exactly
coincided
with
the
habits
of
the
home
team
many
strategic
plans
have
been
wasted
on
carefully
arranged
grounds
and
many
inside
plays
have
gone
by
the
boards
when
the
field
was
fixed
so
that
a
bunt
was
bound
to
roll
foul
if
the
ball
followed
the
laws
of
gravitation
as
it
usually
does
because
the
visiting
team
was
known
to
have
the
bunting
habit
a
good
story
of
doctored
grounds
gone
wrong
is
told
of
the
philadelphia
athletics
the
eccentric
rube
waddell
had
bundles
of
speed
in
his
early
days
and
from
a
slightly
elevated
pitcher
box
the
batter
could
scarcely
identify
rube
delivery
from
that
of
a
cannon
he
was
scheduled
to
pitch
one
day
and
showed
around
at
morning
practice
looking
unusually
fit
for
george
how
are
you
feeling
george
asked
connie
mack
his
boss
never
better
replied
the
rube
well
you
work
this
afternoon
all
right
answered
waddell
then
the
got
busy
and
built
the
pitcher
box
up
about
two
feet
so
that
waddell
would
have
a
splendid
opportunity
to
cut
loose
all
his
speed
at
that
time
he
happened
to
be
the
only
tall
man
on
the
pitching
staff
of
the
philadelphia
club
and
as
a
rule
the
box
was
kept
very
low
the
scheme
would
probably
have
worked
out
as
planned
if
it
had
not
been
that
waddell
in
the
course
of
his
wanderings
met
several
friends
in
whose
society
he
became
so
deeply
absorbed
that
he
neglected
to
report
at
the
ball
park
at
all
he
also
forgot
to
send
word
and
here
was
the
pitcher
box
standing
up
out
of
the
infield
like
one
of
the
peaks
of
the
alps
as
the
players
gathered
and
waddell
failed
to
show
up
the
manager
nervously
looked
at
his
watch
at
last
he
sent
out
scouts
to
the
rube
known
haunts
but
no
trace
of
the
temperamental
artist
could
be
found
the
visitors
were
already
on
the
field
and
it
was
too
late
to
lower
the
box
a
short
pitcher
had
to
work
in
the
game
from
this
peak
of
progress
while
the
opposing
team
installed
a
skyscraper
on
the
mound
the
philadelphia
club
was
badly
beaten
and
waddell
heavily
fined
for
his
carelessness
in
disrupting
the
inside
play
of
his
team
an
old
and
favorite
trick
used
to
be
to
soap
the
soil
around
the
box
so
that
when
a
man
was
searching
for
some
place
to
dry
his
perspiring
hands
and
grabbed
up
this
soaped
earth
it
made
his
palm
slippery
and
he
was
unable
to
control
the
ball
of
course
the
home
talent
knew
where
the
good
ground
lay
and
used
it
or
else
carried
some
unadulterated
earth
in
their
trousers
pockets
as
a
sort
of
private
stock
but
our
old
friend
bugs
raymond
hit
on
a
scheme
to
spoil
this
idea
and
make
the
trick
useless
arthur
always
perspired
profusely
when
he
pitched
and
several
managers
perceiving
this
had
made
it
a
habit
to
soap
the
dirt
liberally
whenever
it
was
his
turn
to
work
while
he
was
pitching
for
louis
he
went
into
the
box
against
the
pirates
one
day
in
pittsburg
his
hands
were
naturally
slippery
and
several
times
he
had
complained
that
he
could
not
dry
them
in
the
dirt
especially
in
pittsburg
soil
as
raymond
worked
in
the
game
in
question
he
was
noticed
particularly
by
the
pittsburg
batters
and
spectators
to
get
better
as
he
went
along
frequently
his
hand
slipped
into
his
back
pocket
and
then
his
control
was
wonderful
sometimes
he
would
reach
down
and
apparently
pick
up
a
handful
of
earth
but
it
did
no
damage
after
the
game
he
walked
over
to
fred
clarke
and
reached
into
his
back
pocket
his
face
broke
into
a
grin
ever
see
any
of
that
stuff
fred
he
asked
innocently
showing
the
pittsburg
manager
a
handful
of
a
dark
brown
substance
that
rosin
great
lots
better
than
soaped
ground
wish
you
keep
a
supply
out
there
in
the
box
for
me
when
i
going
to
work
instead
of
that
slippery
stuff
you
got
out
there
now
will
you
as
a
favor
to
me
thereafter
all
the
pitchers
got
to
carrying
rosin
or
pumice
stone
in
their
pockets
for
the
story
quickly
went
round
the
circuit
and
it
is
useless
to
soap
the
soil
in
the
box
any
more
there
are
many
tricks
by
which
the
grounds
or
ball
are
fixed
but
for
nearly
all
an
antidote
has
been
discovered
and
these
questionable
forms
of
the
inside
game
have
failed
so
often
that
they
have
largely
been
abandoned
one
big
league
manager
used
always
to
give
his
men
licorice
or
some
other
dark
and
adhesive
and
juicy
substance
to
chew
on
a
dingy
day
the
purpose
was
to
dirty
the
ball
so
that
it
was
harder
for
the
batters
to
see
when
the
pitcher
used
his
fast
one
as
soon
as
a
new
ball
was
thrown
into
the
game
it
was
quickly
passed
around
among
the
fielders
and
instead
of
being
the
thing
that
left
the
umpire
hands
when
it
finally
got
to
the
pitcher
box
it
was
a
very
pronounced
brunette
but
some
arbiter
detected
this
and
kept
pouring
new
balls
into
the
game
when
the
chewers
were
at
the
bat
while
he
saved
the
discolored
ones
for
the
consumption
of
the
masticators
it
was
another
trick
that
failed
frequently
backgrounds
are
tampered
with
if
the
home
club
is
notably
weak
at
the
bat
the
best
background
for
a
batter
is
a
dull
solid
green
many
clubs
have
painted
backgrounds
in
several
contrasting
broken
colors
so
that
the
sunlight
shining
on
them
blinds
the
batter
the
chicago
white
sox
are
said
to
have
done
this
and
for
many
years
the
figures
showed
that
the
batting
of
both
the
chicago
players
and
the
visitors
at
their
park
was
very
light
the
white
sox
hitting
was
weak
anywhere
so
that
the
poor
background
was
an
advantage
to
them
injuries
have
often
upset
the
inside
play
of
a
club
usually
a
style
revolves
around
one
or
two
men
and
the
taking
of
them
out
of
the
game
destroys
the
whole
machine
the
substitute
does
not
think
as
quickly
neither
does
he
see
and
grasp
the
opportunities
as
readily
this
was
true
of
the
cubs
last
season
chance
and
evers
used
to
be
the
inside
game
of
the
team
evers
was
out
of
the
game
most
of
the
summer
and
chance
was
struck
in
the
head
with
a
pitched
ball
and
had
to
quit
the
playing
of
the
chicago
team
fell
down
greatly
as
a
result
chance
is
the
sort
of
athlete
who
is
likely
to
get
injured
when
he
was
a
catcher
he
was
always
banged
up
because
he
never
got
out
of
the
way
of
anything
he
is
that
kind
of
player
if
he
has
to
choose
between
accepting
a
pair
of
spikes
in
a
vital
part
of
his
anatomy
and
getting
a
or
dodging
the
spikes
and
losing
the
he
always
takes
the
and
usually
the
spikes
he
never
dodges
away
from
a
ball
when
at
bat
that
may
possibly
break
over
the
plate
and
cost
him
a
strike
that
is
why
he
was
hit
in
the
head
he
lingered
too
long
to
ascertain
whether
the
ball
was
going
to
curve
and
found
out
that
it
was
not
which
put
him
out
of
the
game
the
cubs
practically
out
of
the
pennant
race
and
broke
up
their
inside
play
roger
bresnahan
is
the
same
kind
of
a
man
he
thinks
quickly
and
is
a
brilliant
player
but
he
never
dodges
anything
he
is
often
hurt
as
a
result
once
when
he
was
with
the
giants
he
was
hit
in
the
face
with
a
pitched
ball
and
mcgraw
worried
while
he
was
laid
up
for
fear
that
it
would
make
him
bat
shy
after
he
came
back
he
was
just
as
friendly
with
the
plate
as
ever
the
injury
of
men
like
chance
and
bresnahan
whose
services
are
of
such
vital
importance
to
the
inside
play
of
a
team
destroys
the
effectiveness
of
the
club
once
in
when
we
were
fighting
the
cubs
for
the
pennant
at
every
step
mcgraw
planned
a
bunting
game
against
overall
who
is
big
and
not
very
fast
in
covering
the
little
rollers
bresnahan
and
had
been
having
a
serial
argument
through
two
games
and
roger
whose
nerves
were
worn
to
a
frazzle
like
those
of
the
rest
of
us
at
that
time
thought
hank
had
been
shading
his
judgment
slightly
toward
the
cubs
in
another
story
i
have
pointed
out
that
the
umpire
was
stubborn
and
that
nothing
could
be
gained
by
continually
picking
on
him
when
the
batteries
were
announced
for
that
game
mcgraw
said
as
the
team
went
to
the
field
we
can
beat
this
guy
overall
by
bunting
bresnahan
went
out
to
put
on
his
chest
protector
and
shin
guards
happened
to
be
adjusting
his
makeup
near
him
roger
could
not
resist
the
temptation
why
do
you
put
on
a
chicago
uniform
instead
of
those
duds
he
asked
is
it
true
if
the
cubs
win
the
pennant
they
promised
to
elect
you
alderman
in
chicago
get
out
of
the
game
and
off
the
field
said
bresnahan
had
to
obey
the
injunction
and
needham
the
only
other
available
catcher
went
behind
the
mat
tom
needham
never
beat
out
a
bunt
in
his
life
and
he
destroyed
all
mcgraw
plans
because
with
him
in
the
game
instead
of
bresnahan
the
style
had
to
be
switched
we
lost
bresnahan
a
fast
man
and
a
good
bunter
batted
third
and
would
have
been
valuable
in
the
attack
best
adapted
to
beat
overall
but
his
sudden
demise
and
the
enforced
substitution
of
the
plodding
needham
ruined
the
whole
plan
of
campaign
therefore
frequently
umpires
upset
a
team
inside
game
one
of
mcgraw
schemes
on
him
when
luderus
the
philadelphia
first
baseman
broke
into
the
league
some
one
had
tipped
mac
off
and
tipped
him
wrong
that
this
youngster
could
be
disconcerted
in
a
pinch
by
the
catcher
discussing
signs
and
with
him
thus
distracting
his
attention
chief
said
mcgraw
before
the
game
if
this
luderus
gets
up
in
a
tight
place
slip
him
a
little
talk
the
situation
came
and
meyers
obeyed
instructions
the
game
was
in
philadelphia
and
three
men
were
on
the
bases
with
two
out
ames
was
pitching
what
are
you
bringing
the
bat
up
with
you
for
asked
the
chief
as
luderus
arranged
himself
at
the
plate
no
answer
then
meyers
gave
ames
his
sign
next
he
fixed
his
fingers
in
a
fake
signal
and
addressed
the
young
batter
the
best
hitters
steal
signs
said
the
chief
just
look
down
in
my
glove
and
see
the
signals
but
luderus
was
not
caught
and
kept
his
eyes
glued
on
ames
he
hit
the
next
ball
over
the
right
field
wall
and
won
the
game
as
he
crossed
the
plate
he
said
to
the
chief
it
too
easy
i
do
need
your
signs
they
pulled
that
one
on
me
in
the
bushes
long
ago
after
this
when
that
fellow
bats
said
mcgraw
to
meyers
later
do
as
exact
an
imitation
of
the
sphinx
as
you
know
how
the
tip
was
no
good
the
trick
of
talking
to
the
hitter
is
an
old
one
the
idea
is
for
the
catcher
to
give
a
wrong
sign
for
his
benefit
after
having
flashed
the
right
one
induce
the
batter
usually
a
youngster
to
look
down
at
it
and
then
have
the
pitcher
shoot
one
over
the
plate
while
he
is
staring
in
the
glove
steve
evans
the
louis
tells
a
story
of
a
fan
who
sat
in
the
same
box
at
the
cardinals
park
every
day
and
devoted
most
of
his
time
to
roasting
him
evans
his
favorite
expressions
in
connection
with
evans
were
bone
dead
wooden
head
and
so
on
he
loudly
claimed
that
steve
had
no
knowledge
of
the
game
and
spoiled
every
play
that
bresnahan
tried
to
put
through
one
day
when
the
giants
were
playing
in
louis
some
one
knocked
up
a
high
foul
which
landed
in
this
box
he
saw
it
coming
tried
to
dodge
used
poor
judgment
and
realizing
that
the
ball
was
going
to
strike
him
snatched
his
hat
off
and
took
it
full
on
an
immodestly
bald
head
steve
evans
was
waiting
to
go
to
the
bat
he
shifted
his
chew
to
his
other
cheek
and
exclaimed
in
a
voice
that
could
not
have
been
heard
more
than
two
miles
away
that
the
who
has
been
calling
me
a
head
steve
got
a
great
laugh
from
the
crowd
but
right
there
the
louis
club
lost
a
patron
for
the
one
has
never
been
seen
at
the
grounds
since
according
to
evans
and
his
obituary
has
not
been
printed
yet
either
al
bridwell
formerly
the
giants
shortstop
was
one
of
the
cleverest
men
at
the
inside
game
that
ever
broke
into
the
big
leagues
and
it
was
this
that
made
him
valuable
then
suddenly
his
legs
went
bad
and
he
slowed
up
it
was
his
speed
and
his
ability
to
bunt
and
his
tireless
waiting
at
the
plate
to
make
all
toilers
in
the
box
pitch
that
had
made
him
a
great
player
he
seldom
swung
at
a
bad
ball
as
soon
as
he
slowed
up
mcgraw
knew
he
would
have
to
go
if
the
giants
were
to
win
the
pennant
he
deeply
regretted
letting
the
gritty
little
shortstop
whose
legs
had
grown
stiff
in
his
service
leave
the
club
but
sentiment
never
won
any
pennants
al
he
said
to
bridwell
i
going
to
let
you
go
to
boston
your
legs
will
be
all
right
eventually
but
i
got
to
have
a
fast
man
now
while
you
are
getting
back
your
old
speed
that
all
right
replied
bridwell
it
all
part
of
the
game
he
did
not
rave
and
swear
that
he
had
been
as
many
players
do
under
the
same
circumstances
i
never
heard
bridwell
swear
and
i
never
found
any
one
else
who
did
he
had
been
playing
for
weeks
when
every
time
he
moved
it
pained
him
because
he
thought
he
might
have
a
share
of
the
money
that
winning
a
pennant
would
mean
it
was
a
staggering
blow
to
him
this
sending
him
from
a
pennant
possibility
to
a
hopeless
but
he
took
it
gamely
i
guess
i
was
the
inside
stuff
he
said
and
he
did
get
some
of
the
prize
money
the
boys
voted
him
a
share
it
will
be
seen
that
the
inside
game
sometimes
fails
many
a
time
i
have
passed
a
catcher
or
good
batter
to
take
a
chance
on
a
pitcher
and
then
have
had
him
make
a
hit
just
when
hits
were
not
at
all
welcome
i
walked
a
catcher
once
and
had
the
pitcher
shove
the
ball
over
first
base
for
a
single
when
he
closed
his
eyes
and
dodged
back
in
an
effort
to
get
his
head
out
of
the
line
he
thought
it
was
pursuing
before
it
curved
in
ducking
he
got
his
bat
in
front
of
the
ball
a
result
he
had
never
obtained
with
his
eyes
open
once
i
started
to
pass
hans
wagner
in
a
pinch
to
take
a
chance
on
the
next
batter
and
was
a
little
careless
in
throwing
the
ball
too
close
to
the
plate
he
reached
out
and
slapped
it
for
a
single
again
the
inside
game
had
failed
speaking
pretty
generally
most
managers
prefer
to
use
this
inside
game
though
and
there
are
few
vacancies
in
the
big
leagues
right
now
for
the
man
who
is
liable
to
steal
second
with
the
bases
