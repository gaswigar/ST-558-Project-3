little
chapter
i
in
the
spring
of
strindberg
had
just
published
a
confession
was
employing
all
the
multicolored
glory
of
his
style
to
prove
the
triumph
of
death
hardy
was
somberly
mixing
on
his
palette
the
twilight
grays
and
blacks
and
mourning
purples
of
jude
the
obscure
nordau
gnashing
his
teeth
was
bellowing
decadent
at
his
contemporaries
who
smirked
a
complacent
acceptance
of
the
epithet
and
all
unconscious
of
the
futility
and
sordidness
of
the
world
neale
crittenden
swaggered
along
central
avenue
brandishing
his
shinny
stick
it
was
a
new
yellow
shinny
stick
broad
and
heavy
and
almost
as
long
as
the
boy
who
carried
it
ever
since
he
had
seen
it
in
the
window
of
schwartz
bazar
his
soul
had
yearned
for
it
for
days
he
had
hoarded
his
pennies
foregoing
sodas
shutting
his
ears
to
the
seductive
of
the
cart
and
this
very
afternoon
the
immense
sum
of
cents
had
been
completed
and
now
he
owned
a
genuine
boughten
stick
varnished
and
shiny
what
could
he
do
with
such
a
club
he
beat
it
on
the
sidewalk
till
the
rang
he
swung
it
around
his
head
what
stupendous
goals
he
was
going
to
make
how
he
would
dribble
the
ball
through
the
enemy
spring
had
turned
the
vacant
lots
into
sticky
red
mud
but
central
avenue
was
hard
if
somewhat
undulating
macadam
it
had
stone
curbs
too
that
bounced
the
ball
back
as
if
specially
designed
for
by
a
philanthropic
board
of
supervisors
somewhere
along
it
he
was
sure
to
find
a
game
in
progress
yes
there
they
were
in
front
of
number
two
school
neale
broke
into
a
run
and
coming
up
breathless
plunged
into
the
scrimmage
shinny
as
played
on
union
hill
in
the
nineties
had
none
of
the
refinements
of
its
dignified
cousin
roughly
divided
into
two
sides
an
indeterminate
number
of
players
tried
with
their
sticks
to
knock
a
hard
rubber
ball
to
opposite
ends
of
a
block
team
work
was
elementary
the
slowest
runner
on
each
side
lay
back
to
tend
gool
the
rest
following
the
fortunes
of
the
ball
pelted
to
and
fro
in
a
seething
mêlée
of
scuffling
feet
and
clashing
sticks
after
each
goal
the
ball
was
brought
to
the
middle
of
the
block
the
two
captains
took
their
stand
with
sticks
on
either
side
of
it
one
they
rapped
their
sticks
on
the
pavement
two
they
rapped
them
together
one
two
one
two
then
pandemonium
broke
out
shrilly
sticks
rapping
against
each
other
or
against
opposing
shins
yells
of
shinny
on
your
own
side
a
welter
of
little
boys
battling
around
the
ball
as
it
shot
up
and
down
sometimes
advancing
rapidly
sometimes
stationary
among
a
vortex
of
locked
sticks
until
finally
a
lucky
knock
drove
it
past
one
or
the
other
side
street
once
as
they
were
walking
back
after
a
goal
fatty
schmidt
noticed
neale
new
weapon
oh
you
got
ta
new
shinny
where
you
get
it
schwartz
huh
them
kind
ai
no
good
they
split
neale
was
silent
as
an
iroquois
but
he
had
already
begun
to
doubt
the
heavy
new
stick
did
seem
to
be
turning
out
what
he
had
expected
it
tripped
him
up
occasionally
and
he
never
got
it
on
the
ball
as
quickly
as
he
had
his
old
with
the
knob
of
root
at
the
end
but
he
kept
his
doubts
to
himself
let
out
another
notch
of
speed
and
tried
harder
it
began
to
go
better
he
stopped
a
dangerous
rush
by
hooking
franz
uhler
stick
just
as
he
was
about
to
shoot
for
goal
another
time
unaided
he
took
the
ball
away
from
don
roberts
lost
it
but
marty
ryan
retrieved
it
and
neale
and
marty
raced
down
almost
on
top
of
the
opposing
goal
keeper
marty
hit
the
ball
a
terrific
crack
gool
they
cried
exultingly
then
on
another
note
indignantly
hi
there
drop
that
for
as
the
ball
bounded
along
the
street
a
ragged
little
boy
who
had
sprung
up
from
nowhere
grabbed
it
and
made
off
the
pack
gave
chase
the
little
gamin
had
a
good
start
but
the
bigger
boys
ahead
of
neale
were
gaining
on
him
he
turned
off
eastward
as
neale
tore
along
he
saw
marty
and
franz
catch
up
with
the
little
kid
and
then
what
was
this
where
did
all
those
other
boys
come
from
with
a
whoop
of
joyous
exultation
he
recognized
the
familiar
ambush
the
welcome
invitation
to
battle
come
on
fellers
he
yelled
back
to
his
own
crowd
hoboken
micks
and
with
the
rest
of
the
union
hill
crowd
charged
through
a
fire
of
stones
at
the
invaders
then
it
was
that
the
new
shinny
stick
vindicated
itself
swinging
it
like
a
crusader
sword
neale
hacked
and
hewed
he
landed
on
the
of
a
boy
struggling
with
marty
for
the
ball
he
landed
on
another
mick
ribs
he
heaved
the
stick
up
and
was
going
to
smash
a
hostile
head
when
the
enemy
broke
and
ran
triumphant
the
union
hill
boys
chased
them
to
the
edge
of
the
hill
and
sent
a
volley
of
stones
after
them
as
they
scrambled
down
the
steep
path
among
the
rocks
but
pursued
them
no
further
below
was
the
enemy
country
the
union
hill
crowd
never
ventured
down
the
rocks
to
the
level
flats
beside
the
railroad
tracks
that
was
hoboken
and
a
foreign
land
it
was
supper
time
now
the
victors
said
so
long
to
each
other
and
dispersed
neale
somewhat
lame
but
elated
went
up
the
wooden
steps
of
the
porch
he
stood
his
stick
up
in
the
went
to
the
bathroom
washed
his
hands
brushed
his
hair
at
least
the
top
layer
of
it
and
went
quietly
down
to
the
there
he
ate
his
buttered
toast
and
creamed
potatoes
and
drank
his
cocoa
silently
while
his
father
and
mother
talked
he
paid
no
attention
to
what
they
said
he
was
living
over
again
the
fight
of
the
afternoon
and
forecasting
fresh
conquests
for
the
future
his
mother
passed
him
a
of
preserved
cherries
and
a
piece
of
cake
after
he
had
eaten
this
he
got
up
silently
and
went
back
to
his
room
his
mother
looked
after
him
tenderly
neale
is
a
boy
she
said
although
he
was
no
longer
there
she
still
saw
his
honest
round
face
clear
eyes
fresh
color
she
smiled
to
herself
lovingly
her
husband
nodded
yes
he
a
good
boy
after
a
thoughtful
pause
he
added
seems
an
awfully
kid
though
i
mean
he
keeps
things
to
himself
you
have
any
idea
whether
he
having
a
real
boy
fun
or
not
he
makes
so
little
noise
about
it
as
he
passed
through
the
hall
neale
lingered
a
moment
to
handle
the
shinny
stick
again
he
looked
at
it
carefully
to
see
if
perhaps
there
was
not
a
little
blood
on
it
chapter
ii
union
hill
had
been
created
by
two
very
different
classes
of
a
fact
which
was
obvious
from
its
aspect
its
undistinguished
frame
buildings
for
the
most
part
sheltered
families
who
having
to
live
somewhere
had
settled
there
where
inadequate
communication
with
the
rest
of
the
world
kept
rents
down
side
by
side
with
this
drab
majority
but
mingling
with
it
little
a
few
business
men
had
built
comfortable
roomy
homes
in
an
uninspired
compromise
between
their
business
connections
in
the
city
and
their
preference
for
life
for
their
families
this
narrow
ridge
of
trap
rock
continuing
the
palisades
southward
between
the
partly
reclaimed
back
lots
of
hoboken
and
the
immense
irreclaimable
salt
marshes
of
the
hackensack
valley
had
a
certain
picturesqueness
had
seemed
to
promise
freedom
from
malaria
supposed
at
that
time
to
result
from
the
breathing
the
miasma
hanging
low
about
swamp
land
and
certainly
offered
fresher
air
than
a
flat
on
a
new
york
street
or
a
town
beside
a
new
jersey
marsh
it
was
a
sort
of
compromise
in
which
the
families
came
out
rather
badly
whatever
natural
beauty
might
be
inherent
in
the
site
was
largely
nullified
by
the
tawdry
imaginings
of
small
architects
and
building
contractors
and
despite
popular
medical
theories
the
malaria
was
about
the
same
on
the
hill
as
on
the
flats
but
though
the
advance
of
the
suburban
idea
was
already
developing
more
attractive
sites
at
no
very
great
distance
few
families
moved
away
with
the
massive
immobility
characteristic
of
humanity
the
scattered
families
of
union
hill
stuck
it
out
grim
and
disillusioned
taking
the
consequences
of
their
error
of
judgment
rather
than
lose
the
sensation
of
stability
which
means
home
little
neale
was
quite
unconscious
of
all
this
to
his
thoughts
the
hill
was
home
and
where
could
you
live
except
at
home
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
there
might
be
other
or
better
homes
the
hill
was
where
he
lived
he
accepted
it
as
uncritically
as
he
accepted
life
school
his
parents
being
for
that
region
where
every
one
took
quinine
as
a
matter
of
course
rather
a
healthy
boy
he
accepted
the
initial
facts
of
nature
without
criticism
or
much
interest
working
off
the
surplus
of
his
young
energy
in
baseball
shinny
and
guerilla
skirmishes
with
the
boys
from
other
localities
his
unconcern
with
the
world
around
him
except
for
the
details
of
was
complete
home
was
warm
and
secure
he
did
not
inquire
whether
other
homes
might
be
less
warm
or
more
elegant
food
was
good
to
eat
though
meals
with
adult
conversation
between
his
father
and
mother
were
tedious
and
occupied
far
too
much
time
that
might
have
been
spent
in
play
his
father
was
kind
and
remote
neale
thought
very
little
about
his
father
he
went
away
in
the
morning
after
breakfast
and
came
in
just
before
supper
he
was
in
the
lumber
business
and
when
he
went
away
it
was
to
the
office
neale
never
went
to
the
office
but
once
in
a
while
on
saturdays
father
took
him
walking
down
the
long
flight
of
wooden
steps
down
to
the
enemy
country
where
thanks
to
the
size
of
his
father
protecting
figure
never
a
hoboken
mick
dared
to
throw
a
mudball
across
the
railroad
track
and
a
long
long
way
on
paved
sidewalks
till
they
came
out
on
a
wide
noisy
muddy
street
filled
with
trucks
drawn
by
horses
with
gleaming
round
haunches
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
there
was
any
more
land
but
long
sheds
that
stuck
out
into
the
oily
green
hudson
river
these
sheds
had
huge
doors
through
which
the
big
dappled
horses
kept
hauling
trucks
in
and
out
some
of
the
wharves
had
ships
tied
beside
them
occasionally
these
were
sailing
ships
with
slanting
forward
over
the
street
but
more
often
steamers
black
except
for
a
band
of
red
down
near
the
water
as
neale
walked
along
although
he
never
ventured
to
ask
his
busy
father
to
stop
and
let
him
stare
his
fill
he
could
catch
glimpses
through
the
doorways
of
what
went
on
inside
the
sheds
there
were
steep
sloping
from
the
plank
floor
of
the
pier
to
the
ships
and
up
and
down
these
big
men
in
blue
jumpers
wheeled
always
moving
at
a
through
other
openings
bundles
of
boxes
tied
together
with
rope
slid
down
sloping
boards
and
other
men
with
sharp
hooks
were
always
loading
them
on
trucks
or
unloading
them
from
trucks
or
huge
bales
descended
from
the
air
dangling
at
the
end
of
a
clinking
chain
this
bustle
and
noise
the
strange
tarry
smells
and
the
clatter
of
steam
winches
exhilarated
neale
excited
him
made
something
quiver
and
glow
within
him
he
longed
to
go
in
and
be
part
of
it
but
father
never
went
inside
and
it
never
occurred
to
neale
to
explain
how
he
felt
and
to
ask
father
please
to
take
him
in
silent
as
an
iroquois
he
walked
beside
his
father
who
often
glanced
down
baffled
at
the
healthy
personable
little
boy
beside
him
looking
so
exactly
like
any
other
little
boy
and
yet
often
before
he
fell
asleep
at
night
neale
heard
again
the
clanking
clatter
of
the
great
unloading
cranes
smelled
again
the
intoxicating
tarry
salty
ocean
smells
and
felt
again
something
quiver
and
glow
within
him
there
was
neither
quiver
nor
glow
about
the
place
where
father
finally
stopped
of
his
own
accord
in
a
wide
part
of
the
street
huge
piles
of
lumber
were
stacked
father
would
walk
slowly
along
these
looking
at
them
very
hard
and
then
he
would
go
into
a
tiny
stuffy
little
wooden
house
just
one
room
with
men
in
shirt
sleeves
writing
at
desks
and
there
he
would
talk
incomprehensible
talk
with
one
of
the
men
and
the
man
would
write
at
his
desk
and
father
standing
up
would
write
in
a
with
a
fountain
pen
and
that
was
all
the
fun
there
was
to
the
lumber
business
left
to
himself
neale
sat
on
the
and
watched
the
fascinating
life
on
the
docks
once
he
slipped
across
the
street
and
tried
to
follow
a
truck
in
but
a
big
man
with
a
red
face
yelled
at
him
so
loudly
to
get
out
of
there
that
neale
ran
back
again
furiously
angry
but
not
knowing
how
to
get
around
the
big
watchman
all
he
could
do
was
to
sit
just
inside
the
door
hating
the
watchman
and
stare
at
the
tantalizing
activity
so
far
away
and
wish
with
all
his
heart
that
father
business
were
more
romantic
mother
meant
more
to
neale
than
father
did
he
knew
her
better
a
little
better
he
had
even
some
abstract
ideas
about
her
that
she
was
beautiful
when
she
dressed
up
to
go
out
in
the
afternoon
mother
fussed
about
his
clothes
more
than
was
convenient
and
insisted
on
baths
and
washing
hands
before
meals
but
when
he
was
sick
mother
read
him
stories
and
let
him
leave
the
gas
turned
on
in
his
room
when
he
went
to
bed
mother
gave
him
pennies
too
and
when
father
was
away
on
a
business
trip
he
and
mother
would
eat
alone
together
and
she
would
talk
to
him
and
ask
him
questions
about
school
and
play
and
his
boy
friends
neale
did
mind
telling
her
things
he
liked
mother
but
he
could
seem
to
manage
to
think
of
a
great
deal
to
tell
her
it
sounded
foolish
to
talk
about
games
to
and
games
were
really
all
that
neale
cared
about
almost
all
that
he
ever
thought
about
as
to
telling
mother
other
things
the
few
other
things
he
did
occasionally
think
about
why
there
did
seem
to
be
anywhere
to
start
he
have
to
begin
way
back
at
the
beginning
and
now
that
neale
was
ten
years
old
the
beginning
was
too
far
back
for
him
to
lay
hold
of
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
did
not
often
ask
about
any
of
it
even
in
her
distant
careful
way
of
asking
she
just
took
good
care
of
him
and
had
what
he
liked
for
supper
and
put
the
kind
of
books
he
liked
up
in
his
room
and
kept
his
buttons
sewed
on
and
every
night
till
he
was
a
big
big
boy
came
into
his
room
to
kiss
him
in
his
bed
she
say
anything
much
then
just
have
you
enough
covers
maybe
or
i
believe
i
better
open
that
window
wider
and
then
with
the
kiss
neale
mother
then
he
turned
over
and
nearly
always
went
instantly
to
sleep
when
father
was
at
home
mostly
father
and
mother
talked
together
at
table
and
read
together
after
supper
in
the
while
neale
did
his
lessons
upstairs
or
else
mother
would
dress
up
in
one
of
her
pretty
dresses
and
father
would
put
on
a
clean
shirt
and
his
dark
suit
and
they
would
go
across
the
river
to
a
theater
in
new
york
leaving
neale
to
katie
the
irish
cook
who
had
been
with
them
since
before
neale
birth
or
sometimes
they
had
company
other
ladies
in
pretty
dresses
and
other
husbands
in
clean
shirts
and
dark
suits
then
they
had
a
specially
good
supper
the
sort
of
expensive
things
that
were
usually
reserved
for
sunday
dinner
planked
shad
and
roast
chicken
and
and
coffee
in
the
little
cups
that
mother
always
washed
herself
neale
did
mind
company
since
nobody
paid
much
attention
to
him
and
he
liked
the
extra
sunday
eatables
on
a
but
one
of
his
few
impressions
about
his
father
and
mother
was
that
although
they
always
talked
and
laughed
a
great
deal
more
when
there
was
company
and
seemed
to
have
a
lively
time
they
really
liked
it
better
when
there
were
only
the
two
of
them
talking
over
neale
head
at
the
table
and
settling
down
afterwards
to
read
and
talk
to
one
another
around
the
another
of
those
impressions
was
the
tone
of
his
father
voice
when
looking
up
from
his
book
he
said
oh
mary
neale
always
knew
just
the
look
there
would
be
in
mother
eyes
as
she
laid
down
her
own
book
and
asked
yes
what
is
it
dear
chapter
iii
among
the
many
things
which
neale
never
thought
of
questioning
was
the
fact
that
he
did
not
go
to
a
public
school
as
all
his
did
if
he
had
asked
he
would
have
found
that
his
father
and
mother
had
an
answer
all
ready
for
him
the
completeness
and
thoroughness
of
which
might
have
indicated
that
they
had
perhaps
silenced
some
questionings
of
their
own
with
it
he
would
have
heard
that
of
course
they
approved
of
public
schools
and
that
if
they
had
continued
to
live
in
massachusetts
even
if
they
had
gone
to
live
in
a
nice
part
of
new
york
city
they
would
certainly
have
sent
their
son
to
a
public
school
but
here
at
union
hill
with
the
public
schools
so
thickly
populated
by
foreign
children
the
conditions
were
really
different
what
could
a
little
american
boy
learn
in
a
with
forty
foreign
children
whose
constant
study
must
needs
be
english
there
was
no
flaw
in
the
reasoning
they
were
prepared
to
present
to
their
son
when
he
should
ask
the
natural
question
about
his
schooling
but
neale
never
asked
it
by
the
time
he
was
old
enough
to
think
of
it
habit
had
made
him
incapable
of
conceiving
it
he
no
more
wondered
why
he
went
every
morning
to
the
taylors
house
on
bower
street
instead
of
to
public
school
number
two
than
why
he
had
two
eyes
instead
of
one
that
was
the
way
things
were
neale
was
slow
to
question
the
way
things
were
taylor
was
another
transplanted
new
englander
like
neale
father
with
another
wife
rarer
in
those
days
than
now
like
neale
mother
his
ideas
on
children
and
the
public
schools
would
have
been
exactly
like
those
of
the
crittendens
even
if
they
had
not
been
fortified
by
the
lameness
of
his
only
son
jimmy
crutches
made
public
school
definitely
out
of
the
question
and
since
jimmy
must
have
instruction
at
home
why
his
two
sisters
elsie
and
myrtle
might
as
well
profit
by
it
taylor
was
glad
enough
to
have
the
expense
of
paying
miss
vanderwater
shared
by
crittenden
and
to
let
neale
share
in
the
benefits
of
miss
vanderwater
instruction
hence
it
happened
that
every
morning
neale
rang
at
the
taylors
front
door
and
when
the
maid
let
him
in
went
upstairs
to
the
big
front
room
on
the
top
floor
and
there
did
whatever
miss
vanderwater
told
him
to
do
he
was
under
her
command
from
nine
in
the
morning
till
noon
when
he
went
home
and
had
lunch
with
mother
who
always
asked
how
school
had
gone
to
which
question
neale
always
made
the
same
truthful
answer
that
he
guessed
it
was
all
right
at
one
he
returned
for
two
more
hours
with
miss
vanderwater
in
this
way
he
went
through
a
series
of
readers
filled
with
thin
spencerian
script
copied
maps
in
colored
ink
with
the
shaded
with
scallops
did
arithmetic
on
a
slate
and
made
very
fair
progress
in
learning
german
german
was
much
in
the
air
in
that
locality
of
course
he
did
not
spend
all
those
years
of
his
life
side
by
side
with
three
other
children
without
becoming
intimately
acquainted
with
them
but
one
of
the
instinctive
watertight
compartments
in
mind
was
the
one
in
which
he
kept
his
school
separate
from
his
life
he
studied
with
the
taylor
children
but
he
never
dreamed
of
staying
after
hours
to
play
with
them
and
yet
he
knew
them
infinitely
better
than
any
of
the
innumerable
chance
with
whom
he
flew
kites
or
played
he
knew
instinctively
knew
without
thinking
of
it
knew
to
the
marrow
of
his
brutally
normal
bones
that
jimmy
taylor
was
lame
not
only
in
his
legs
but
in
his
character
delicacy
the
great
care
taken
of
him
the
fact
that
he
always
played
in
the
house
or
with
his
sisters
made
a
sissy
of
him
that
was
the
plain
fact
and
neale
was
not
one
to
refuse
to
admit
plain
facts
he
was
always
kind
to
jimmy
at
least
not
unkind
but
he
was
always
secretly
relieved
when
the
front
door
shut
behind
him
hiding
from
him
jimmy
hands
thin
neck
and
querulous
invalid
voice
of
the
two
girls
elsie
was
only
a
little
kid
so
much
younger
than
jimmy
and
neale
that
they
were
barely
aware
of
her
existence
myrtle
on
the
contrary
was
very
much
there
a
little
girl
whose
comments
on
things
never
failed
to
arouse
in
neale
the
profoundest
astonishment
how
could
anybody
think
of
such
dotty
things
to
say
you
never
had
the
least
idea
how
anything
was
going
to
strike
her
except
that
it
was
likely
to
strike
her
so
hard
that
she
made
an
awful
fuss
about
it
myrtle
lived
in
mortal
terror
of
any
little
dirt
it
seemed
to
neale
one
day
in
may
when
they
had
had
a
out
in
the
of
the
taylors
house
myrtle
carried
on
perfectly
wild
about
a
little
flying
white
thing
that
had
fallen
into
her
glass
of
lemonade
holy
smoke
thought
neale
if
she
was
afraid
to
get
it
out
was
so
he
fished
it
out
with
a
spoon
and
handed
her
back
the
glass
and
what
did
she
do
she
made
up
an
awful
face
and
threw
the
lemonade
on
the
ground
neale
was
horrified
at
the
waste
and
the
day
when
miss
vanderwater
in
their
natural
history
lesson
told
them
about
and
how
they
keep
the
ground
light
and
open
did
myrtle
go
off
in
another
fit
with
her
eyes
goggling
and
her
fingers
all
stretched
apart
as
though
she
felt
everywhere
she
insisted
that
miss
vanderwater
must
be
wrong
that
such
an
awful
thing
could
not
be
true
why
what
do
you
mean
asked
miss
vanderwater
for
once
neale
noticed
with
satisfaction
as
much
at
a
loss
as
he
ugh
cried
myrtle
so
all
we
eat
has
grown
out
of
what
have
vomited
up
and
so
they
wriggling
around
touching
everything
that
grows
i
never
dreamed
of
such
a
nasty
thing
i
never
eat
a
radish
again
it
makes
me
sick
to
think
of
it
to
put
my
mouth
where
a
horrible
old
has
been
rubbing
all
its
slime
off
now
what
do
you
think
of
that
neale
asked
himself
mostly
myrtle
was
just
the
worst
dead
loss
you
ever
saw
but
once
in
a
while
you
got
some
good
out
of
her
foolishness
like
the
time
when
she
bit
into
a
apple
and
laid
it
down
looking
very
white
and
sick
at
her
stomach
she
had
bitten
into
a
rotten
place
and
although
neale
pointed
out
honestly
to
her
that
it
was
the
only
bad
spot
and
that
the
rest
of
the
apple
was
a
corker
she
refused
to
touch
it
or
even
to
look
at
it
she
said
she
never
wanted
to
see
another
apple
again
as
long
as
she
lived
so
neale
ate
it
to
save
it
sinking
his
strong
teeth
through
the
taut
red
skin
reveling
in
the
craunchy
juicy
white
flesh
chewing
away
on
huge
crisp
delicious
mouthfuls
it
was
perhaps
as
well
too
that
myrtle
had
tried
to
go
on
eating
it
for
neale
found
another
rotten
spot
but
he
spit
out
the
brown
stuff
into
the
waste
basket
and
having
got
rid
of
it
went
on
with
the
apple
his
zest
undiminished
to
the
last
mouthful
gnawed
off
the
core
the
idea
of
going
back
on
apples
because
you
struck
a
rotten
place
nobody
asked
you
to
the
rotten
places
it
was
perfectly
easy
to
spit
them
out
or
if
you
saw
them
beforehand
to
eat
your
way
around
them
he
could
make
anything
out
of
myrtle
at
all
but
he
did
allow
himself
to
be
bothered
by
her
any
more
than
by
rotten
spots
in
apples
and
he
escaped
from
her
and
from
the
whole
genteel
atmosphere
of
the
taylor
household
the
moment
three
came
the
instant
miss
vanderwater
said
dismissed
he
hurried
home
left
his
books
and
hurried
out
again
to
hang
around
number
two
school
till
four
sent
all
its
mingled
conglomeration
ranging
from
tattered
ragamuffins
to
little
boys
in
white
yelling
and
whooping
out
to
the
vacant
lots
for
although
the
crittendens
new
england
americanism
was
not
quite
resolute
enough
to
make
them
send
neale
to
a
public
school
full
of
foreigners
it
was
more
than
enough
to
make
them
incapable
of
conceiving
so
odious
an
act
of
tyranny
as
forbidding
a
little
boy
to
play
freely
with
other
little
boys
whether
any
one
knew
their
parents
or
not
they
would
have
detested
the
idea
of
keeping
neale
alone
in
their
safe
sheltered
and
would
have
been
horrified
to
detect
in
him
any
trace
of
feeling
himself
better
than
the
children
which
he
certainly
did
not
sundays
had
a
special
color
of
their
own
not
at
all
the
traditional
one
the
crittendens
were
unitarians
not
much
given
to
anywhere
and
the
nearest
unitarian
church
was
across
the
river
in
new
york
crittenden
had
enough
of
new
york
on
so
they
never
went
few
of
the
union
hill
families
did
union
hill
was
anything
but
a
stronghold
of
sabbatarianism
it
considered
sunday
rather
as
a
opportunity
for
much
comfortable
attendance
on
a
and
for
enormous
family
gatherings
around
a
big
dinner
for
neale
with
no
other
children
in
the
family
the
day
was
always
solitary
not
unpleasantly
so
it
was
a
day
for
long
imaginings
stirring
warlike
imaginings
realized
through
lead
soldiers
lead
soldiers
were
a
passion
of
his
little
boyhood
he
had
two
hundred
and
ten
counting
the
ones
with
their
legs
broken
that
he
had
mounted
on
half
corks
he
did
not
move
them
around
much
he
did
not
knock
them
down
when
he
got
them
set
up
in
the
order
he
wished
he
fell
into
a
trance
imagining
stories
and
incidents
it
took
a
long
time
to
get
them
arranged
to
his
satisfaction
with
stiff
marching
columns
at
in
the
middle
some
indian
prone
or
kneeling
behind
painted
lead
shrubbery
out
in
front
a
squadron
of
parade
cavalry
on
one
wing
a
troop
of
galloping
arabs
on
the
other
always
he
had
a
pile
of
blocks
behind
which
a
charger
was
tethered
and
on
top
leaning
against
a
spool
of
thread
stood
the
general
surveying
his
army
by
uniform
and
whiskers
the
toymaker
had
intended
the
figure
for
kaiser
wilhelm
i
but
to
the
boy
eyes
it
was
no
prussian
king
but
neale
neale
commanding
his
victorious
troops
it
was
all
arranged
with
a
careful
hand
and
a
loving
heart
and
it
took
a
long
long
time
very
often
the
rang
before
he
had
even
finished
setting
them
up
at
sunday
dinner
there
was
generally
company
men
friends
of
father
mostly
but
sometimes
husbands
and
wives
neale
knew
all
their
names
and
shook
hands
without
he
grinned
silently
if
they
spoke
to
him
and
retired
to
his
shell
busying
himself
with
his
own
thoughts
all
concentrated
on
the
impending
battle
he
liked
the
things
you
had
to
eat
on
sunday
and
had
found
that
on
sunday
he
could
eat
the
soft
parts
out
of
his
bread
and
hide
the
crusts
under
the
edge
of
his
plate
mother
always
caught
him
if
he
tried
that
on
but
on
sundays
with
company
there
she
never
said
a
word
but
no
matter
how
slowly
he
ate
he
was
always
through
wriggling
uncomfortably
on
his
chair
and
horribly
bored
while
those
tedious
people
were
still
gabbling
on
mother
always
saw
this
took
pity
and
smiled
a
permission
to
him
to
be
off
he
slipped
from
his
chair
and
silently
into
the
kitchen
where
katie
was
dressing
the
salad
but
she
stopped
long
enough
to
open
the
pasteboard
box
from
schlauchter
and
give
him
a
from
the
soft
part
on
top
then
he
hurried
upstairs
again
to
act
out
with
his
army
the
glorious
scenes
he
had
been
imagining
during
dinner
sometimes
it
was
a
surprise
attack
on
the
march
with
cavalry
sweeping
down
on
limbered
guns
sometimes
it
was
artillery
formed
in
triangles
a
muzzle
at
each
apex
blowing
the
advancing
cavalry
to
flinders
sometimes
it
was
a
magnificent
parade
of
triumph
through
a
city
gate
with
kaiser
wilhelm
neale
at
their
head
but
at
any
moment
especially
as
he
came
on
to
be
ten
years
old
quite
suddenly
and
inexplicably
he
grew
tired
of
it
the
illusion
would
pass
they
would
be
just
lifeless
stupid
dead
soldiers
with
broken
legs
and
rifles
and
the
paint
flaking
off
impossible
to
imagine
anything
with
them
also
his
arms
and
legs
would
feel
numb
with
sitting
still
on
the
floor
so
long
then
neale
would
slide
noiselessly
down
the
banisters
using
his
hands
and
legs
as
a
brake
to
keep
from
crashing
into
the
slip
by
the
door
with
its
clinking
and
blue
haze
of
cigar
smoke
grab
his
cap
and
go
quietly
outdoors
nobody
would
have
stopped
him
he
knew
that
but
it
was
more
fun
to
keep
it
quiet
free
from
the
house
he
would
act
out
his
drama
of
escape
by
running
for
a
block
or
so
and
then
drop
into
the
roaming
boy
slow
ramble
you
can
walk
south
or
north
on
union
hill
for
miles
beyond
a
endurance
without
finding
a
single
feature
to
quicken
the
imagination
but
if
you
go
east
or
west
from
anywhere
on
the
hill
you
come
at
once
to
a
place
where
below
you
stretches
the
flat
marshy
river
or
the
flats
neale
preferred
the
western
edge
even
though
it
had
no
steep
rocks
he
was
far
from
having
any
conscious
love
for
landscape
but
he
found
a
certain
satisfaction
in
looking
over
the
yellow
and
brown
expanse
of
the
and
hazy
in
the
afternoon
sun
cut
with
straight
black
lines
of
railroads
he
named
them
over
to
himself
identifying
every
one
the
jersey
central
pennsylvania
erie
lackawanna
and
jersey
northern
each
with
little
each
tiny
locomotive
sending
up
little
balls
of
to
hang
motionless
in
the
still
afternoon
air
to
the
southwest
a
hazy
blur
that
was
newark
and
right
in
front
like
a
doomed
mountain
bogged
and
sinking
into
the
marsh
the
sinister
bulk
of
snake
hill
neale
used
to
stand
and
brood
over
it
sometimes
till
the
sun
went
down
all
red
and
orange
he
did
not
stir
till
the
cold
roused
him
to
think
of
home
and
supper
but
his
feet
did
not
always
turn
westward
sometimes
he
walked
to
the
eastern
edge
the
rocks
were
steeper
here
steep
enough
to
be
the
impregnable
fortress
he
always
imagined
them
when
he
came
here
after
reconnoitering
the
ground
for
his
tribal
enemy
did
not
observe
the
truce
of
god
on
sundays
neale
would
go
out
to
the
edge
of
the
sheerest
promontory
and
dangle
his
legs
down
under
his
feet
were
railroad
tracks
again
then
a
belt
of
vacant
lots
some
of
them
black
with
others
green
with
the
scum
of
stagnant
water
then
a
belt
of
frame
houses
where
the
enemy
lived
then
a
zone
of
city
brick
and
flat
tin
roofs
beyond
it
all
was
castle
point
high
and
green
healthy
green
this
not
scum
jutting
out
into
the
hudson
indistinctly
he
could
make
out
the
other
side
of
the
river
the
line
of
ships
at
the
wharves
and
more
city
new
york
occasionally
neale
thought
of
new
york
an
almost
mythical
spot
though
he
went
there
once
in
a
while
with
mother
on
tiresome
quests
for
clothes
as
well
as
to
matinées
sometimes
he
thought
of
the
ships
and
the
wharves
and
how
much
he
wished
he
could
see
more
of
them
but
mostly
he
forgot
the
actual
world
he
was
in
command
of
the
fort
all
around
him
his
brave
men
were
working
the
guns
bang
bang
the
enemy
were
marching
along
those
straight
paved
streets
their
cannon
balls
were
bursting
all
around
but
the
garrison
did
not
quail
their
were
starting
to
climb
the
rocks
ah
this
was
serious
no
time
for
delay
the
commander
seized
the
rifle
from
the
hand
of
a
dying
soldier
how
plainly
neale
saw
that
dying
soldier
there
at
his
feet
bang
bang
bang
with
every
shot
one
of
the
foremost
scalers
dropped
headlong
the
engagement
was
a
decisive
victory
chapter
iv
inevitably
saturdays
were
all
devoted
to
play
neither
neale
parents
nor
he
himself
could
have
conceived
of
any
other
way
of
spending
saturdays
what
were
saturdays
for
it
is
true
that
in
some
of
the
more
prosperous
families
saturday
was
day
just
as
four
instead
of
ushering
in
or
marbles
meant
sitting
in
front
of
a
piano
or
stooping
over
a
but
neale
felt
for
thus
victimized
the
same
slightly
contemptuous
pity
he
felt
for
jimmy
taylor
lameness
and
the
same
unsurprised
acceptance
of
his
own
good
luck
in
being
free
from
such
limitations
once
in
a
while
too
mother
took
him
over
to
new
york
to
a
matinée
and
that
was
all
right
too
if
it
did
happen
too
often
neale
liked
going
out
with
mother
pretty
well
and
if
there
was
fighting
in
the
play
he
liked
it
fine
but
all
that
was
having
something
done
to
you
a
sensation
of
which
school
gave
neale
more
than
enough
and
which
he
did
like
half
so
well
oh
not
a
quarter
as
well
oh
really
not
at
all
compared
to
the
sensation
of
starting
something
and
running
it
yourself
if
it
really
came
right
down
to
a
comparison
there
was
any
fun
at
all
in
seeing
irving
pretend
to
be
a
crazy
man
compared
to
the
fun
of
starting
out
saturday
morning
with
no
idea
what
you
were
going
to
do
and
rustling
around
till
you
got
enough
fellows
together
for
the
game
of
the
season
to
stand
in
your
old
on
your
of
a
saturday
morning
all
the
world
before
you
unfettered
by
obligations
a
long
long
rich
day
of
play
before
you
that
was
how
could
anybody
be
expected
to
prefer
to
dress
up
in
things
you
had
to
try
to
keep
clean
sit
in
a
dark
hot
theater
and
watch
men
and
women
carry
on
like
all
possessed
about
things
that
were
really
so
but
that
was
all
right
enough
for
a
change
and
was
as
good
a
way
as
any
to
spend
a
rainy
afternoon
also
you
could
occasionally
get
ideas
about
fights
out
of
a
play
but
the
real
occupation
of
life
was
the
playing
of
games
he
nourished
his
soul
and
grew
strong
on
the
emotional
thrills
of
games
they
were
the
rich
fertile
substantial
soil
out
of
which
he
shot
up
into
boyhood
from
childhood
they
were
his
religion
and
his
the
wide
field
where
unhampered
free
as
any
naked
savage
for
all
his
decent
knickerbockers
and
sweater
he
raced
to
and
fro
elastic
exultant
wild
with
the
intoxication
of
the
heady
young
strength
poured
into
him
by
every
new
day
the
astounding
volume
of
sound
bursting
up
like
flame
and
lava
from
a
volcano
which
rose
from
every
group
of
boys
at
play
bore
witness
to
the
extravagant
and
superabundant
splendor
of
the
intensity
with
which
they
lived
a
splendor
not
at
all
recognized
by
suffering
householders
near
whose
decent
and
quiet
homes
a
gang
of
boys
settled
down
to
play
and
yell
and
shriek
and
quarrel
and
run
and
yell
again
it
was
the
boys
world
not
only
untouched
by
but
blessedly
even
unsuspected
by
parents
since
it
was
theirs
since
they
created
it
anew
every
day
it
exactly
fitted
their
needs
and
it
grew
and
changed
with
their
inner
growth
as
their
school
never
did
they
were
far
from
any
notion
that
they
created
it
rather
they
seemed
to
themselves
to
accept
it
from
the
outside
as
they
accepted
the
weather
what
had
they
to
do
with
the
succession
of
the
seasons
either
of
games
or
temperature
in
the
nature
of
things
you
could
no
more
play
marbles
in
the
autumn
than
pick
wild
strawberries
in
december
in
the
autumn
they
played
football
a
sort
of
with
no
limit
to
the
number
on
each
side
played
with
a
heavy
black
rubber
ball
blown
up
with
a
brass
tube
the
tube
always
got
lost
and
the
valve
always
leaked
after
a
few
games
it
became
deflated
with
the
resiliency
of
a
soggy
sponge
but
it
was
kicked
to
and
fro
just
the
same
when
snow
came
there
was
with
forts
of
a
rich
chocolate
color
from
the
mixed
with
the
snow
about
these
raged
feudal
chivalry
loyalty
and
pride
of
place
one
street
against
another
sometimes
all
the
district
united
against
invading
huns
from
hoboken
or
jersey
city
heights
only
a
few
boys
skated
and
neale
was
not
one
of
them
but
everybody
made
slides
in
the
slush
with
spring
came
marbles
utilizing
the
cracks
between
sidewalk
slabs
tops
kites
cat
a
game
for
two
and
ah
baseball
in
the
vacant
lots
neale
was
neither
a
star
nor
a
dub
at
any
game
but
craving
proficiency
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
he
learned
to
do
pretty
well
at
all
of
them
at
baseball
the
major
sport
of
the
year
he
toiled
incessantly
and
when
he
was
ten
years
old
he
was
pretty
sure
of
his
job
at
second
base
on
the
hancock
avenue
orioles
on
ground
balls
he
was
erratic
but
so
was
everybody
on
those
rough
diamonds
where
the
ball
ricocheted
from
one
stone
to
another
long
practice
catching
fungoes
gave
him
a
certainty
on
pop
flies
his
wing
was
poor
as
he
expressed
it
strong
enough
in
the
arm
he
had
never
mastered
the
wrist
snap
that
gives
velocity
as
a
batsman
he
was
temperamental
one
day
he
would
feel
right
and
hit
everything
another
day
his
batting
eye
would
inexplicably
be
gone
and
he
would
fan
at
the
widest
one
saturday
afternoon
they
were
playing
the
crescent
juniors
a
glorious
of
a
game
in
which
neale
had
run
wild
all
the
afternoon
it
was
in
the
ninth
the
score
was
to
with
the
crescents
ahead
one
was
down
neale
at
the
bat
marty
ryan
the
captain
was
dancing
on
the
base
line
ready
to
dart
in
from
third
franz
uhler
was
taking
a
dangerous
lead
off
second
neale
rapped
his
bat
professionally
on
the
plate
and
glared
at
the
pitcher
hit
it
out
crit
old
man
yelled
fatty
schwartz
with
a
perfectly
unnecessary
volume
of
tone
hit
it
out
save
me
a
lick
much
good
you
do
with
a
lick
thought
neale
to
himself
you
could
hit
a
with
a
telegraph
pole
yes
it
was
up
to
him
to
him
alone
it
was
like
a
scene
from
one
of
his
favorite
stories
about
himself
actually
happening
and
it
went
on
actually
happening
a
wide
one
another
wide
they
did
call
balls
in
neale
league
he
rapped
the
plate
aw
put
it
over
if
you
know
how
he
taunted
a
foul
tip
caught
another
wide
one
haughtily
ignored
a
strike
the
catcher
put
on
his
mask
and
moved
up
close
behind
the
bat
neale
felt
himself
nerved
to
great
things
he
glued
his
eyes
to
the
pitcher
by
the
motion
it
should
be
a
slow
out
it
was
breaking
neale
stabbed
at
it
sliced
it
and
landed
a
texas
leaguer
back
of
short
he
did
see
what
happened
he
ran
he
flew
as
he
rounded
second
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
left
fielder
and
falling
over
their
feet
both
trying
to
pick
up
the
ball
as
he
turned
the
corner
at
third
he
saw
the
pitcher
starting
to
run
in
to
cover
the
plate
and
guessing
that
the
catcher
was
chasing
a
wild
throw
neale
put
his
head
down
and
sprinted
for
dear
life
fifteen
feet
from
the
plate
he
dove
and
shot
over
in
a
cloud
of
dust
neale
the
ball
and
the
pitcher
all
arrived
there
at
the
same
moment
but
a
partial
umpire
called
it
safe
don
roberts
fouled
to
the
catcher
fatty
schwartz
fanned
but
the
game
was
won
with
his
chest
a
couple
of
inches
bigger
than
normal
neale
started
for
home
and
there
on
the
sidewalk
watching
him
stood
his
father
looking
right
at
him
instead
of
over
his
head
as
father
was
apt
to
do
father
patted
him
on
the
shoulder
that
was
a
good
swat
neale
he
said
neale
wriggled
well
we
had
to
have
a
hit
he
explained
and
i
knew
don
and
fatty
would
do
much
his
father
found
no
other
comment
to
make
neale
had
said
his
say
silent
as
iroquois
they
walked
home
to
supper
the
next
afternoon
father
brought
him
a
louisville
slugger
bat
and
neale
was
in
the
seventh
heaven
and
yet
at
the
next
game
he
fanned
the
first
three
times
up
and
marty
waved
him
to
the
bench
this
was
terrible
but
the
sting
did
not
last
because
two
days
later
miss
vanderwater
gave
each
of
them
a
present
of
a
little
book
in
german
and
said
auf
wiedersehn
for
the
summer
chapter
v
the
end
of
school
always
meant
the
beginning
of
the
yearly
romance
the
beginning
of
the
two
months
when
neale
really
lived
all
the
time
not
just
after
four
and
on
saturdays
and
yet
it
was
not
all
made
up
of
games
in
fact
there
were
any
games
at
all
queer
neale
life
was
largely
made
up
of
things
that
happened
over
and
over
the
same
way
and
so
did
this
the
last
day
of
school
he
always
went
home
and
found
the
house
smelling
trunky
and
mother
with
piles
of
clothes
folded
on
all
the
chairs
packing
a
saratoga
trunk
all
the
afternoon
she
would
pack
it
putting
things
in
and
taking
things
out
to
make
room
for
other
things
and
when
father
came
home
things
would
be
all
unfinished
it
happened
just
that
way
always
when
father
came
home
things
all
unfinished
and
father
took
out
his
watch
and
said
the
expressman
had
said
he
come
at
and
mother
answered
you
know
they
always
two
hours
late
nevertheless
she
stopped
taking
things
out
and
there
was
a
scramble
and
things
put
in
any
old
way
with
a
good
deal
of
laughing
and
funning
from
father
and
mother
and
finally
with
mother
and
neale
sitting
on
the
lid
father
in
his
shirt
sleeves
strapped
and
locked
it
then
while
they
were
eating
supper
the
expressman
drove
up
only
an
hour
late
no
not
even
quite
an
hour
late
neale
thought
and
took
the
trunk
away
and
now
neale
felt
they
were
going
he
lay
awake
that
night
thinking
of
the
coming
adventure
his
heart
beating
faster
and
then
it
was
morning
and
mother
was
shaking
him
and
getting
him
into
his
clothes
a
hurried
breakfast
on
lukewarm
oatmeal
they
went
outside
and
got
into
a
coupé
standing
there
father
and
mother
sat
on
the
back
seat
and
neale
on
the
little
front
seat
you
had
to
unfold
then
jog
jog
they
went
along
griffith
street
down
the
curlycue
road
the
horse
feet
going
clatter
on
the
cobblestones
then
jog
jog
jog
again
till
at
last
they
stopped
and
got
out
they
had
come
to
the
ferry
after
they
were
on
the
father
and
mother
always
waited
so
that
neale
could
see
the
pull
down
the
gates
that
closed
the
end
of
the
boat
and
take
out
the
iron
hooks
that
held
her
fast
to
the
dock
then
the
whistle
blew
and
the
boat
started
leaving
the
dock
looking
as
though
a
giant
had
bitten
a
out
of
it
father
walked
with
him
out
to
the
front
deck
where
holding
to
his
sailor
hat
neale
watched
the
waves
and
tug
boats
and
the
gulls
flapping
about
father
made
him
look
at
the
city
ahead
and
pointing
out
a
building
with
a
gold
dome
told
him
that
it
was
the
world
building
and
the
highest
in
the
city
neale
looked
found
it
of
no
interest
and
went
back
to
his
waves
and
gulls
which
stirred
something
of
the
quiver
and
wonder
the
wharves
made
him
feel
when
the
boat
got
across
it
went
smash
into
the
piles
and
slid
along
into
the
dock
where
men
hitched
it
fast
with
iron
hooks
and
pulled
the
hooks
tight
by
turning
a
wheel
around
neale
always
noticed
just
how
such
things
were
managed
and
father
always
gave
him
plenty
of
time
to
look
then
up
went
the
gates
and
off
went
everybody
outside
they
got
into
a
after
a
while
the
began
to
run
through
a
long
cellar
and
father
explained
just
as
he
had
last
year
and
the
year
before
that
that
could
remember
when
the
trains
used
to
be
pulled
through
that
tunnel
by
horses
at
the
other
end
of
the
tunnel
they
all
got
out
once
more
and
now
at
last
you
were
really
getting
quite
warm
for
this
was
the
railway
station
after
father
had
bought
the
tickets
and
checked
the
baggage
they
got
on
the
train
and
father
and
mother
talked
for
a
while
till
father
said
with
a
long
breath
well
it
might
as
well
be
soon
as
late
and
kissed
mother
and
she
kissed
him
until
neale
was
a
pretty
big
boy
father
always
stooped
and
kissed
him
too
but
neale
felt
that
this
was
quite
a
different
sort
of
kiss
and
he
noticed
too
that
after
it
father
always
kissed
mother
again
and
held
his
cheek
for
an
instant
close
to
hers
but
after
this
he
always
walked
right
away
quietly
turning
around
once
or
twice
to
wave
his
hat
at
them
his
face
as
composed
as
that
of
any
man
in
the
crowd
coming
and
going
beside
the
train
mother
let
neale
settle
things
in
the
train
making
no
comment
as
he
fussed
over
it
putting
the
satchel
up
in
the
rack
and
then
deciding
that
it
would
be
better
to
have
it
down
where
he
could
put
his
feet
on
it
arranging
his
coat
and
her
over
the
back
of
the
seat
and
then
remembering
the
hook
between
the
windows
then
the
train
started
a
smoky
tunnel
a
scraggly
belt
of
and
then
the
real
country
neale
never
called
anything
the
real
country
unless
there
were
cows
in
the
fields
he
was
always
astonishingly
glad
to
see
it
and
stared
and
stared
till
his
eyes
ached
and
drooped
shut
and
he
had
a
nap
hunched
up
with
his
feet
on
the
seat
when
he
woke
up
there
was
more
real
country
and
finally
they
got
there
there
was
grandfather
crittenden
waiting
for
them
with
the
team
and
the
only
the
two
back
seats
were
out
to
make
room
for
the
big
trunk
this
was
something
like
living
grandfather
crittenden
let
him
hold
the
lines
he
remembered
he
remembered
every
step
of
the
eight
miles
every
hill
every
house
and
barn
and
big
rock
till
finally
they
drove
into
the
yard
got
out
were
kissed
and
went
up
to
the
same
room
as
last
year
with
its
and
painted
yellow
bed
mother
washed
his
face
very
hard
in
the
cold
water
from
the
big
white
pitcher
there
was
supper
of
fried
ham
and
scrambled
eggs
and
rolls
and
cherry
pie
and
that
was
all
a
tired
little
boy
could
remember
that
night
next
morning
vacation
really
began
with
a
rush
outdoors
to
see
the
mill
the
the
center
of
neale
life
in
the
country
there
it
was
just
as
it
ought
to
be
the
big
saw
snarling
its
way
through
a
pine
log
and
old
silas
with
the
lever
in
his
hand
standing
as
though
he
moved
since
the
day
neale
had
gone
away
last
september
neale
ran
around
to
the
back
climbed
on
the
carriage
and
rode
back
and
forth
as
silas
fed
the
log
methodically
down
on
the
saw
and
raced
it
back
to
set
a
fresh
cut
silas
only
nodded
without
speaking
he
did
like
wasting
words
and
speaking
was
mostly
wasted
when
the
saw
was
screaming
the
belts
slapping
and
down
below
was
the
pound
pound
pound
of
the
after
a
time
neale
went
down
to
the
far
end
of
the
mill
where
the
fresh
sawed
boards
fell
off
from
the
logs
a
new
lad
he
did
know
was
taking
away
he
was
keeping
up
with
the
work
very
well
and
to
help
him
neale
picked
up
a
slab
and
started
to
cut
it
into
stove
lengths
on
the
saw
hey
there
whacher
doin
you
saw
your
arm
off
boy
yelled
the
lad
but
silas
stopping
the
saw
so
that
his
voice
could
be
heard
saved
neale
face
let
be
nat
he
wo
get
hurt
he
knows
more
about
the
mill
now
than
you
do
or
ever
will
neale
felt
his
heart
swell
with
pride
he
sawed
pine
slabs
till
his
back
ached
from
lifting
and
his
shirt
and
hands
were
black
from
the
dried
resin
there
were
other
things
to
do
at
grandfather
crittenden
all
the
other
things
that
boys
do
in
the
country
and
neale
did
them
all
but
none
of
them
came
up
to
the
mill
day
in
and
day
out
it
was
around
the
mill
that
he
spent
his
time
lying
on
the
piles
of
fresh
sawed
boards
in
the
sunlight
watching
teamsters
roll
huge
logs
on
the
skidway
with
or
he
went
below
where
you
could
look
through
the
doorway
at
the
flapping
belts
and
watch
the
sawdust
raining
down
and
making
a
great
yellow
pyramid
even
such
an
experienced
millhand
as
neale
was
not
allowed
to
go
into
the
cellar
while
the
mill
was
running
under
pain
of
all
sorts
of
violent
and
disagreeable
deaths
getting
your
coat
caught
by
the
shafting
and
being
whirled
round
and
round
and
beaten
to
a
pulp
against
the
beams
was
one
of
the
mildest
but
after
supper
when
the
mill
was
shut
down
he
used
to
saunter
out
to
it
in
the
long
soft
twilight
and
then
down
into
the
cellar
and
play
uneasily
in
the
sawdust
casting
scared
looks
now
and
then
at
the
shining
of
the
saw
with
its
wicked
hooked
teeth
just
over
his
head
one
day
as
he
played
thus
about
the
mill
his
destiny
came
and
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
he
knew
not
that
day
from
any
other
day
as
he
was
watching
silas
take
up
the
slack
in
a
belt
a
strange
man
an
elderly
powerful
bent
old
countryman
came
into
the
mill
and
asked
without
salutations
to
any
one
where
jo
gone
to
town
for
feed
said
silas
he
added
with
a
grin
burton
make
you
acquainted
with
a
relation
of
yours
boy
he
jerked
his
head
at
neale
the
stranger
looked
hard
at
the
boy
out
of
sharp
gray
eyes
and
the
harder
he
looked
the
sharper
grew
his
eyes
what
he
doin
here
he
asked
silas
oh
he
always
hangin
round
he
knows
the
trade
as
well
as
some
folks
twice
his
size
said
silas
well
what
do
you
think
of
the
sawyer
trade
asked
the
old
man
suddenly
of
neale
neale
could
not
think
of
anything
to
answer
except
that
he
guessed
he
liked
it
all
right
the
stranger
seemed
to
dismiss
him
from
his
mind
fingered
his
gray
goatee
and
looked
all
around
as
if
seeing
the
establishment
for
the
first
time
mebbe
mebbe
all
right
for
massachusetts
pine
and
saft
maple
but
if
you
want
to
see
a
real
mill
that
handle
tough
vermont
yellow
birch
and
you
come
back
to
ashley
with
me
the
stranger
stayed
to
supper
and
neale
learned
that
he
was
his
burton
crittenden
he
asked
many
questions
that
made
his
brother
neale
grandfather
snort
and
say
hotly
oh
we
all
know
there
ai
any
proper
mill
practice
outside
vermont
but
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
is
managing
to
worry
along
somehow
in
her
shiftless
fashion
but
when
the
old
man
spoke
to
neale
there
was
a
gentler
note
in
his
voice
he
talked
of
and
snowdrifts
and
asked
neale
mother
if
she
would
send
the
boy
to
ashley
some
time
to
visit
his
his
mother
agreed
to
do
it
some
time
in
the
chapter
vi
april
old
jeanne
amigorena
was
on
her
way
to
bayonne
to
complain
to
her
niece
of
her
rheumatism
and
her
she
detested
the
railroad
as
she
did
everything
new
and
not
basque
but
at
her
age
it
was
not
easy
to
foot
it
along
the
fourteen
kilometres
of
white
road
between
midassoa
and
bayonne
so
grimly
disapproving
she
hoisted
her
square
stalwart
body
into
the
compartment
of
the
slow
which
comes
shuffling
up
from
the
spanish
frontier
about
noon
even
for
a
basque
of
the
oldest
rock
there
is
one
satisfaction
to
be
had
out
of
the
trip
by
rail
to
bayonne
this
is
at
the
station
of
la
negresse
where
your
meets
the
down
express
from
paris
the
chic
people
from
the
compartments
are
there
summoned
to
get
out
and
change
to
the
little
local
line
which
jolts
them
the
three
kilometres
to
biarritz
this
change
of
cars
is
never
announced
at
paris
it
is
always
furiously
exasperating
to
tourists
and
in
consequence
they
afford
an
entertaining
spectacle
to
any
one
with
a
low
opinion
of
human
nature
jeanne
who
had
less
than
no
regard
for
any
human
nature
outside
the
basque
race
always
enjoyed
the
contempt
she
felt
for
these
ineffectual
french
weaklings
she
took
advantage
of
the
leisurely
wait
at
la
negresse
while
the
luggage
was
noisily
transferred
from
one
train
to
the
other
to
lean
her
head
and
shoulders
out
of
the
window
and
to
indulge
herself
in
a
hearty
bout
of
derision
for
the
uncomely
fashionable
parisians
and
flabby
she
drew
a
long
breath
of
satisfaction
in
her
own
untrammeled
ribs
to
see
their
rigid
bodies
like
badly
carved
pieces
of
wood
in
the
steel
armor
of
their
corsets
their
shoulders
grotesquely
widened
by
their
high
puffed
sleeves
used
to
stepping
out
for
a
daily
walk
over
mountain
paths
free
and
rhythmic
in
her
flexible
sandals
she
laughed
inwardly
at
these
fine
ladies
tottering
on
their
leather
shoes
some
of
them
were
dragging
along
tired
children
jeanne
had
a
passion
for
children
and
she
now
cried
to
herself
for
the
thousandth
time
what
can
the
blessed
virgin
be
thinking
of
to
trust
babies
to
such
creatures
straight
as
a
lance
with
more
vigor
in
her
body
at
seventy
than
any
of
them
at
twenty
with
more
glistening
black
hair
of
her
own
under
her
close
black
coif
than
any
of
them
could
afford
to
buy
jeanne
who
never
altered
her
costume
by
a
hair
or
a
line
from
one
year
end
to
another
who
looked
forward
confidently
to
fifteen
or
twenty
years
of
iron
health
felt
a
cheerful
glow
of
contempt
as
she
watched
them
running
here
and
there
screaming
nervously
that
one
of
their
innumerable
bags
or
valises
was
lost
their
faces
distorted
with
apprehension
for
some
part
of
their
superfluities
she
did
not
altogether
approve
of
the
hatted
conventionally
dressed
women
she
passed
half
an
hour
later
in
the
sunny
streets
of
the
little
city
on
her
way
to
the
home
of
anna
etchergary
anna
was
concierge
of
one
of
the
apartment
houses
on
the
rue
thiers
opposite
the
old
castle
and
to
reach
it
jeanne
had
to
pass
through
the
new
quarter
of
bayonne
the
big
open
square
where
the
fine
shops
are
and
the
frenchified
madames
walking
about
bayonne
was
a
poor
enough
apology
for
a
basque
city
thought
jeanne
but
its
somewhat
backsliding
and
partly
gascon
and
spanish
inhabitants
were
at
least
not
such
grimacing
monkeys
as
those
parisians
she
strode
along
with
the
swift
sure
poised
gait
of
people
her
mind
full
of
the
grievances
she
wanted
to
pour
out
to
anna
the
disrespect
of
her
son
wife
and
the
scandalous
extravagances
of
her
expenditures
consider
anna
she
rehearsed
her
story
beforehand
she
uses
the
eggs
herself
instead
of
sending
them
to
market
she
serves
as
though
michel
house
were
a
hotel
and
she
will
not
spin
she
uses
michel
money
to
to
think
that
money
from
the
amigorena
farm
should
go
to
buy
yarn
with
a
distaff
hanging
on
the
wall
and
ten
idle
fingers
at
the
end
of
her
arms
on
the
terrible
subject
of
lack
of
children
in
that
house
jeanne
could
not
trust
herself
to
speak
it
was
too
sore
a
spot
that
with
all
jeanne
five
grown
sons
she
had
not
a
grandchild
to
hold
in
her
arms
the
two
americans
now
who
were
in
the
argentine
making
their
fortunes
were
married
and
had
families
but
what
were
grandchildren
on
the
other
side
of
the
globe
to
jeanne
the
two
younger
ones
who
were
sailors
were
not
married
and
michel
who
had
promised
to
be
the
mainstay
of
her
life
and
had
stayed
at
home
to
run
the
farm
here
he
had
been
caught
by
that
impudent
little
french
girl
one
of
the
chambermaids
in
a
biarritz
hotel
a
girl
who
did
not
know
how
to
spin
who
laughed
at
the
decent
basque
ways
and
who
had
no
shame
for
her
sterility
refusing
to
go
to
lourdes
to
pray
for
children
jeanne
had
never
had
any
romantic
feeling
for
her
shiftless
husband
whose
irregular
earnings
as
a
fisher
she
had
been
forced
to
piece
out
with
much
domestic
service
in
the
houses
of
others
and
now
he
was
dead
she
never
thought
of
him
she
had
never
been
to
a
theater
in
her
life
nor
read
a
novel
for
she
could
not
read
at
all
none
of
her
native
capacity
for
emotion
had
been
used
in
her
youth
nor
frittered
away
later
in
the
of
modern
life
it
had
all
been
poured
out
upon
children
on
her
five
sons
and
on
the
one
little
daughter
the
little
marie
who
had
died
at
eleven
so
many
years
ago
just
after
her
first
communion
the
blessed
saint
marise
had
looked
slim
and
straight
in
her
white
dress
the
blessed
virgin
had
found
her
namesake
too
sweet
to
wait
for
and
had
taken
her
at
once
and
now
those
strong
yearning
old
arms
were
empty
of
young
life
and
jeanne
heart
was
bitter
she
might
scold
her
loudest
over
the
waste
of
butter
and
eggs
at
the
farm
she
might
gossip
her
head
off
about
the
faults
of
the
neighbors
and
shriek
out
maledictions
on
the
stingy
bourgeoise
who
wanted
to
buy
her
vegetables
for
nothing
she
could
not
drown
out
the
forlorn
echo
of
emptiness
and
loneliness
within
she
turned
up
the
rue
thiers
glanced
frowningly
at
the
department
store
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
with
its
gaudy
the
pride
of
the
younger
generation
in
bayonne
and
looked
up
with
approval
at
the
huge
thick
battlemented
walls
of
the
old
castle
substantial
enough
that
and
plain
enough
and
old
enough
to
please
even
a
basque
as
she
turned
in
at
the
door
of
anna
apartment
house
her
mouth
was
open
to
begin
her
litany
of
grievances
but
when
she
entered
lodging
she
found
her
niece
with
a
budget
of
exciting
news
of
her
own
oh
tante
jeanne
what
do
you
think
she
burst
out
as
the
old
woman
swung
lightly
in
but
before
she
would
go
on
she
went
to
close
the
door
bearing
herself
so
secretly
with
such
that
jeanne
was
between
exasperation
and
greediness
to
hear
like
all
illiterates
who
can
not
glut
on
the
newspapers
their
appetite
for
gossip
she
was
insatiable
for
it
in
talk
she
sat
down
on
the
front
of
her
chair
her
ear
cocked
eagerly
anna
drew
her
own
chair
up
close
and
began
to
speak
in
basque
very
rapidly
i
so
glad
come
tante
jeanne
you
had
so
much
experience
in
working
out
in
families
you
know
about
things
you
know
about
those
american
farm
machines
that
they
beginning
to
use
on
the
big
farms
painted
red
you
know
well
the
american
agent
for
that
company
he
has
come
here
to
live
here
in
this
house
the
grand
apartments
the
ones
old
père
lapagorry
rents
furnished
on
sides
of
the
landing
yes
the
two
of
them
because
his
wife
a
very
chic
madame
did
think
one
was
big
enough
and
what
can
one
family
do
with
two
kitchens
tell
me
that
and
they
with
only
one
child
to
their
name
a
little
girl
who
does
take
up
any
more
room
than
a
flea
so
to
speak
and
the
lady
has
asked
me
to
find
her
a
cook
and
a
maid
and
listen
tante
she
says
she
will
pay
sixty
francs
a
month
and
fed
and
lodged
she
paused
to
underline
this
and
looked
triumphantly
at
her
aunt
who
for
years
had
worked
as
cook
in
families
for
forty
francs
a
month
and
lodged
herself
jeanne
looked
back
at
her
hard
a
new
possibility
lifting
a
corner
of
its
veil
in
her
mind
what
are
they
like
these
americans
she
asked
or
to
a
basque
the
term
means
one
of
his
own
race
who
has
emigrated
to
south
america
made
his
pile
and
returned
to
his
own
country
to
spend
it
they
not
basques
at
all
said
anna
what
french
said
jeanne
instantly
incredulous
of
anna
story
there
was
no
use
trying
to
tell
that
any
french
family
was
willing
to
pay
twice
the
usual
wage
for
servants
no
they
do
even
understand
french
but
the
madame
can
read
it
a
little
oh
spanish
then
no
i
had
pedro
gallon
go
up
to
see
them
and
they
do
speak
a
word
of
spanish
they
not
even
catholics
the
two
women
stared
at
each
other
what
could
people
be
who
were
not
spanish
or
french
or
basque
or
even
catholics
anna
went
on
tante
jeanne
come
upstairs
and
see
for
yourself
what
they
are
like
you
have
seen
so
many
bourgeois
families
you
can
tell
better
than
i
only
say
you
have
come
to
help
me
find
servants
for
them
anna
followed
her
aunt
out
into
the
hall
and
locked
the
door
behind
her
the
key
to
the
door
hung
with
a
dozen
others
large
and
clanking
at
the
belt
of
her
blue
jeans
apron
anna
philosophy
of
life
consisted
in
having
plenty
of
keys
and
keeping
them
in
constant
use
the
only
things
you
could
be
sure
of
were
the
things
you
yourself
had
locked
up
they
climbed
the
shining
oaken
stairway
anna
special
care
and
pride
turning
itself
around
and
around
in
the
circular
well
lighted
by
small
pointed
windows
which
showed
the
thickness
of
the
stone
walls
they
stood
before
the
dark
paneled
door
its
highly
polished
brass
knob
in
the
middle
and
pulled
hard
at
the
thick
tasseled
a
bell
jangled
nervously
light
uneven
footsteps
sounded
on
the
bare
floor
inside
and
a
small
pretty
woman
stood
before
them
dressed
in
a
pale
blue
elaborately
trimmed
with
white
silk
she
smiled
a
pleasant
recognition
at
anna
and
gave
a
friendly
nod
to
the
older
woman
jeanne
disliked
her
on
sight
the
old
peasant
assumed
a
respectful
decorous
submissive
attitude
as
became
her
social
position
and
made
a
quick
estimate
at
the
age
of
the
other
woman
she
made
it
at
a
guess
although
she
reflected
that
probably
any
man
would
guess
not
more
than
jeanne
knew
by
the
sixth
sense
which
comes
from
many
years
of
unbiased
observation
of
life
that
the
other
woman
was
the
sort
who
looks
much
younger
than
she
is
she
also
was
aware
as
by
an
emanation
that
the
other
woman
was
not
french
that
was
apparent
from
every
inch
of
her
the
way
she
stood
and
smiled
and
wore
her
gown
and
yet
she
was
dressed
like
any
french
lady
with
a
high
boned
collar
up
to
her
ears
sleeves
with
a
stiff
puff
at
the
shoulders
and
a
full
long
heavy
skirt
that
hung
in
ripples
and
lay
on
the
floor
behind
also
her
fair
hair
was
tousled
up
into
a
pompadour
with
a
big
shining
knot
on
top
jeanne
her
head
a
little
to
one
side
and
bent
forward
in
a
patient
pose
of
silent
respect
wondered
if
that
fair
hair
were
her
own
or
were
false
and
made
a
guess
that
a
good
deal
of
it
was
false
all
this
jeanne
took
in
and
pondered
while
anna
was
trying
to
explain
by
who
her
aunt
was
and
why
she
had
come
the
foreign
lady
listened
intently
but
it
was
evident
that
she
did
not
understand
at
all
jeanne
took
advantage
of
her
absorption
with
anna
to
look
at
her
intently
with
the
ruthless
peasant
scrutiny
going
straight
through
all
the
finer
distinctions
of
character
deep
down
to
the
one
fundamental
the
one
question
essential
to
the
peasant
mind
in
all
human
relationships
is
she
stronger
than
i
jeanne
saw
at
once
that
the
lady
before
her
was
not
stronger
than
she
was
not
indeed
strong
at
all
although
she
looked
as
though
she
might
have
an
irritable
temper
she
was
one
you
could
always
get
around
thought
jeanne
her
strong
hands
folded
meekly
before
her
her
powerful
body
a
little
stooped
to
make
herself
look
politely
mild
she
was
one
who
did
know
what
she
wanted
enough
to
go
after
it
and
get
it
thought
jeanne
casting
her
black
eyes
down
the
picture
of
a
european
servant
with
a
proper
respect
for
the
upper
classes
she
served
the
lady
laughing
and
fluttering
now
motioned
them
into
the
salon
some
of
the
furnishings
had
been
taken
away
thought
jeanne
looking
about
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
no
lace
over
the
windows
in
this
room
sat
the
monsieur
of
the
family
a
large
man
smoking
a
large
cigar
and
reading
an
enormous
newspaper
on
encountering
a
new
member
of
the
male
sex
jeanne
although
she
had
long
passed
the
age
when
she
needed
personally
to
make
the
distinction
always
made
a
first
sweeping
division
of
them
into
two
classes
those
who
were
dangerous
to
women
and
those
who
were
not
she
instantly
put
down
the
monsieur
of
the
new
family
among
those
who
were
not
although
he
was
not
bad
looking
not
more
than
with
all
his
teeth
still
in
his
mouth
and
all
his
thick
dark
hair
still
on
his
head
but
a
woman
of
jeanne
disillusioned
experience
of
human
nature
knew
from
the
expression
of
his
listless
brown
eyes
from
his
careless
attitude
in
his
chair
from
the
indifferent
way
he
looked
at
the
three
women
before
him
from
the
roughness
of
his
hair
evidently
combed
but
once
a
day
with
no
perfumed
dressing
on
it
that
he
was
not
now
and
never
had
been
a
man
who
cared
for
conquests
among
women
or
who
had
had
many
she
immediately
felt
for
him
a
slight
contempt
as
for
somebody
not
all
there
mentally
and
wondered
if
his
wife
were
not
occasionally
unfaithful
to
him
she
looked
as
though
she
might
be
that
kind
a
rattling
little
thing
like
that
reflected
jeanne
behind
her
downcast
eyes
changing
imperceptibly
from
one
humble
pose
to
another
anna
now
turned
to
her
aunt
with
a
long
breath
i
can
not
make
her
understand
she
said
in
basque
think
of
a
nice
lady
like
that
not
being
able
to
talk
i
can
not
make
her
think
anything
but
that
you
have
come
to
be
the
cook
yourself
well
i
might
do
worse
said
jeanne
unexpectedly
her
mouth
watering
at
the
chance
for
pickings
she
spoke
in
basque
her
face
remained
as
unmoved
as
though
it
were
the
it
seemed
her
niece
stared
for
a
moment
horizons
opening
before
her
oh
tante
jeanne
if
you
only
would
with
you
here
and
me
in
the
concierge
loge
what
a
chance
for
commissions
off
everybody
from
the
grocer
to
the
jeanne
agreed
although
with
no
enthusiasm
but
i
not
young
i
need
the
money
if
only
michel
wife
would
she
gave
a
quick
look
at
the
man
and
woman
before
her
who
were
now
exchanging
some
words
in
their
tongue
they
seem
such
odd
people
who
knows
what
they
are
like
their
not
being
able
to
talk
and
all
and
not
even
catholics
she
hesitated
feeling
a
distaste
for
their
foreignness
and
for
the
fussy
effusive
smilingness
of
the
madame
jeanne
always
distrusted
ladies
who
smiled
at
their
servants
there
could
only
be
war
to
the
knife
between
servants
and
their
employer
why
pretend
anything
else
a
little
girl
in
a
white
dress
came
swiftly
into
the
room
now
a
slim
child
of
eleven
she
darted
in
as
though
she
was
looking
for
something
and
in
a
hurry
to
find
it
when
she
saw
the
two
basque
women
she
paused
suddenly
motionless
and
gave
them
a
steady
inquiring
gaze
out
of
clear
dark
eyes
jeanne
stared
at
her
startled
the
child
had
thick
black
hair
glossy
and
straight
a
skin
and
long
eyes
with
arching
eyebrows
as
black
as
her
hair
which
made
a
curving
line
on
her
forehead
and
ran
back
at
the
sides
upon
her
temples
anna
noticed
the
older
woman
surprise
and
said
casually
yes
it
queer
how
the
little
girl
looks
like
one
of
us
a
real
little
basque
she
seems
nice
enough
only
with
no
manners
see
how
she
comes
bursting
into
a
room
and
then
only
stares
but
none
of
the
family
have
any
manners
if
it
comes
to
that
the
child
made
a
quick
move
now
and
still
moving
swiftly
stepped
to
jeanne
side
to
jeanne
astonishment
she
put
out
her
small
white
fingers
and
took
jeanne
gnarly
old
hand
in
a
firm
grip
bonjour
madame
she
said
smiling
faintly
at
her
attempt
to
speak
the
foreign
language
although
her
eyes
were
grave
jeanne
had
for
an
instant
a
strange
impression
that
the
child
seemed
to
think
that
she
had
found
what
she
was
looking
for
at
the
sight
of
the
little
girl
at
the
living
touch
of
that
small
warm
hand
jeanne
forgot
the
chic
madame
with
the
shallow
eyes
and
the
dull
monsieur
with
the
tired
eyes
she
looked
down
at
the
child
who
had
eyes
that
were
looking
for
something
the
old
woman
and
the
little
girl
exchanged
a
long
serious
gaze
one
of
those
deep
inarticulate
contacts
of
human
souls
which
come
and
go
like
a
breath
taken
and
leave
human
lives
altered
for
always
jeanne
drew
a
long
breath
she
said
in
a
low
tone
to
the
child
forgetting
that
she
could
not
understand
what
do
you
call
yourself
dear
the
child
answered
in
french
haltingly
but
with
a
pure
accent
i
call
myself
mary
oh
yes
explained
anna
the
little
girl
is
picking
up
french
fast
i
can
make
her
mother
understand
now
through
her
she
does
the
ordering
for
them
at
the
bouyenval
pension
already
they
are
taking
their
meals
there
till
they
get
servants
to
begin
housekeeping
madame
bouyenval
was
telling
me
this
morning
jeanne
interrupted
her
niece
speaking
in
basque
well
if
you
think
you
can
make
that
featherhead
of
her
mother
understand
anything
you
can
tell
them
that
i
come
to
stay
and
i
bring
a
with
me
to
the
foreign
lady
she
said
respectfully
in
french
with
a
deferential
inclination
of
her
tall
strong
body
a
votre
service
madame
chapter
vii
may
marise
sat
in
her
room
in
front
of
her
table
a
opening
blank
pages
of
coarse
paper
before
her
a
thin
book
marked
mots
usuels
on
her
lap
it
was
her
own
impression
that
she
had
stopped
for
a
minute
rest
from
study
although
she
had
not
yet
begun
and
that
she
was
thinking
hard
but
she
was
not
thinking
she
was
feeling
she
sat
with
her
elbows
on
the
table
her
chin
in
her
two
hands
braced
so
that
she
was
quite
motionless
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
candle
flame
burning
bright
fluttering
and
throbbing
in
the
draughts
which
came
into
the
old
room
around
the
decrepit
under
the
door
through
the
there
seemed
to
be
a
thousand
wandering
puffs
from
every
direction
what
marise
called
her
thoughts
were
burning
bright
fluttering
and
throbbing
like
the
tiny
flame
at
which
she
stared
they
too
were
blown
upon
by
a
thousand
breaths
from
every
direction
if
they
would
only
hold
still
for
a
moment
marise
thought
and
give
out
a
steady
light
that
she
could
see
something
by
if
she
only
had
some
shade
to
put
around
those
flickering
thoughts
so
they
would
quiver
so
it
upset
her
jerking
around
so
from
one
way
of
seeing
things
to
another
what
she
wanted
to
know
was
how
did
things
look
of
course
it
was
worse
here
in
france
where
everything
was
so
uncertain
but
it
had
started
back
home
in
america
it
had
always
been
going
on
ever
since
she
could
remember
it
had
always
made
her
feel
queer
as
though
she
were
holding
an
envelope
up
to
a
mirror
to
read
the
address
and
saw
it
wrong
end
to
the
way
everything
looked
different
at
ashley
the
moment
maman
came
up
to
vermont
to
take
her
home
after
vacations
with
cousin
hetty
marise
loved
it
so
there
at
ashley
the
dear
darling
old
house
in
the
mountains
with
its
nice
atticky
smell
that
no
other
house
in
the
world
had
it
just
fitted
all
around
you
when
you
went
in
the
door
the
way
cousin
hetty
arms
fitted
around
you
when
she
took
you
up
on
her
lap
and
rocked
and
sang
we
hunted
and
we
hallooed
at
the
memory
marise
heart
gave
a
great
homesick
throb
how
far
away
she
was
from
cousin
hetty
and
ashley
now
how
long
since
she
had
sat
on
anybody
lap
and
yet
when
maman
came
to
take
you
away
from
the
first
minute
she
went
in
and
looked
around
her
you
could
see
right
through
her
eyes
and
what
you
saw
was
something
different
after
all
it
was
just
a
homely
old
house
with
ugly
crocheted
tidies
on
the
chairs
and
splashers
done
in
outline
stitch
back
of
the
and
old
red
figured
carpets
on
the
floors
the
way
did
at
home
in
belton
and
cousin
hetty
talking
so
queer
and
vermonty
her
white
hair
smoothed
down
flat
over
her
ears
instead
of
all
roughed
up
fluffy
over
a
rat
the
pretty
way
other
ladies
did
with
her
funny
clothes
her
big
cameo
pin
holding
down
her
little
flat
round
collar
and
all
other
ladies
so
stylish
with
high
collars
under
their
ears
yes
of
course
the
minute
maman
looked
at
her
you
saw
how
ashamed
you
be
of
cousin
hetty
if
she
came
to
visit
your
school
at
belton
and
yet
there
the
other
cousin
hetty
been
having
such
a
good
time
with
you
just
flickered
away
from
way
of
seeing
it
to
yours
and
never
could
make
up
your
mind
which
was
the
real
way
marise
shook
her
head
drew
a
long
breath
and
looked
down
again
at
her
spelling
lesson
it
was
a
list
of
the
names
of
furniture
and
household
utensils
all
very
familiar
to
her
from
old
jeanne
thinking
them
so
terribly
important
my
how
much
more
jeanne
cared
about
her
work
than
any
girl
they
ever
had
in
belton
sommier
traversin
all
the
names
of
the
complicated
parts
of
a
bed
a
sacred
french
bed
as
marise
looked
at
them
on
the
page
she
could
see
jeanne
in
the
mornings
taking
poor
stupid
little
isabelle
head
right
off
because
she
did
make
the
bed
up
smoothly
enough
and
all
the
time
it
was
about
a
million
times
smoother
than
any
bed
ever
was
in
america
marise
did
believe
the
president
of
the
united
states
had
his
pulled
so
tight
and
smooth
and
she
wondered
if
jeanne
worked
in
the
white
house
if
she
would
let
even
the
president
little
girl
sit
down
on
the
bed
in
the
daytime
how
they
were
about
things
in
france
about
everything
when
you
bought
anything
in
a
store
how
they
did
drive
you
wild
with
their
slowness
in
getting
it
put
up
in
the
package
just
as
if
it
mattered
when
you
were
going
to
take
it
out
of
the
package
three
minutes
later
as
soon
as
you
got
home
and
at
school
how
they
did
fuss
about
neatness
the
lessons
were
easy
enough
to
learn
marise
never
had
any
trouble
with
lessons
but
how
could
anybody
ever
do
things
as
neatly
as
they
wanted
you
to
and
how
the
teacher
jumped
on
you
if
you
did
ever
so
much
worse
than
if
you
got
the
answer
to
an
arithmetic
problem
wrong
mercy
how
she
did
scold
there
was
anybody
in
america
knew
to
scold
like
that
even
if
they
wanted
to
and
they
did
it
had
scared
marise
at
first
and
made
her
feel
like
crying
and
she
never
had
got
entirely
used
to
it
although
she
saw
how
all
the
other
girls
did
just
took
it
and
did
care
and
did
whatever
they
liked
behind
her
back
marise
could
get
used
to
jeanne
that
way
either
to
her
yelling
so
when
she
scolded
marise
hated
to
have
people
get
mad
and
excited
and
how
jeanne
did
carry
on
about
the
house
being
neat
the
part
that
is
where
company
could
come
under
her
kitchen
sink
it
smelled
awfully
and
was
full
of
greasy
rags
and
yet
she
shine
up
the
salon
floor
over
and
over
when
it
was
already
shiny
and
never
think
of
those
rags
the
least
little
bit
of
clutter
left
around
in
the
or
even
your
own
room
and
how
she
would
scold
and
yet
she
was
so
awfully
good
to
you
and
was
always
giving
you
big
smacking
kisses
and
hugging
you
and
she
always
saved
over
the
best
things
to
eat
when
maman
had
a
lunch
party
and
you
were
at
school
even
when
maman
had
said
you
could
have
any
of
something
jeanne
always
brought
it
to
your
room
under
her
apron
after
you
gone
to
bed
it
was
very
nice
to
do
things
behind
back
but
everybody
seemed
to
be
doing
things
behind
everybody
back
maman
did
behind
father
lots
of
times
and
it
was
perfectly
understood
between
them
that
marise
was
never
to
tell
father
on
her
and
it
would
be
telling
on
jeanne
if
you
told
mother
and
anyhow
marise
did
see
maman
so
very
much
any
more
to
tell
her
things
it
was
mostly
jeanne
who
did
things
for
her
marise
laid
down
her
book
again
lost
in
one
of
her
recurrent
attacks
of
amazement
at
there
being
so
many
different
jeannes
inside
that
one
leathery
skin
there
was
the
jeanne
who
came
every
morning
to
take
orders
and
folded
her
hands
on
her
apron
and
sort
of
stooped
herself
over
and
said
oui
madame
to
everything
maman
said
you
think
she
was
scared
to
death
of
maman
and
yet
she
went
away
to
the
kitchen
on
the
other
side
of
the
landing
and
became
another
jeanne
who
never
paid
the
least
attention
to
what
maman
had
said
but
ran
the
house
just
the
way
she
thought
it
ought
to
be
there
were
two
jeannes
right
there
and
there
was
another
one
the
outdoor
jeanne
who
took
her
to
school
every
morning
how
funny
that
in
france
a
great
girl
of
eleven
had
to
have
somebody
tagging
along
every
time
she
stepped
outside
the
house
this
was
the
most
interesting
jeanne
of
all
she
told
stories
every
single
minute
lots
of
them
were
about
when
she
had
been
a
little
girl
gracious
think
of
jeanne
ever
having
been
a
little
girl
that
was
ever
so
long
ago
before
the
emperor
and
the
empress
had
made
biarritz
the
fashion
jeanne
said
those
were
the
good
days
when
the
basques
had
their
country
to
themselves
and
you
never
saw
a
hat
on
any
woman
head
they
all
wore
the
black
kerchief
for
everyday
and
mantillas
on
sunday
for
mass
and
lived
like
christians
jeanne
could
remember
when
biarritz
was
just
a
little
fishing
village
a
decent
place
and
look
at
it
she
could
remember
just
as
well
when
napoleon
and
his
spanish
wife
first
began
to
come
down
there
so
the
empress
could
get
as
near
to
spain
as
possible
many
and
many
the
time
jeanne
had
seen
them
in
their
springy
barouche
driving
right
along
this
very
street
he
with
his
eyes
as
dead
as
a
fish
and
she
as
handsome
as
any
basque
girl
they
were
all
stories
of
jeanne
when
she
was
a
little
girl
lots
of
them
were
of
what
had
happened
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
years
ago
around
here
there
were
ever
so
many
stories
of
witches
and
ghosts
and
sorcerers
there
were
plenty
of
those
still
in
the
basque
country
there
was
a
sorcerer
living
in
that
little
house
near
the
river
on
the
road
to
barthélemy
why
jeanne
own
mother
years
ago
one
day
looked
up
from
her
spinning
and
saw
a
monstrous
pig
big
and
black
she
jumped
up
and
ran
out
to
try
to
catch
it
her
grandmother
went
out
too
and
there
were
a
lot
of
the
neighbors
who
were
trying
to
drive
the
pig
away
but
it
did
pay
a
bit
of
attention
butted
at
them
so
fierce
when
they
came
near
they
were
afraid
for
he
was
as
tall
as
a
calf
and
whoever
saw
a
pig
as
big
as
that
and
then
the
grandmother
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
spanish
fashion
and
like
snapping
your
fingers
the
pig
change
right
before
their
eyes
into
a
little
wee
woman
never
seen
and
she
went
up
in
the
air
as
thin
and
light
as
a
loose
spider
thread
and
drifted
away
and
there
was
nothing
there
the
little
american
girl
knew
enough
to
know
that
this
story
could
be
true
of
course
and
yet
jeanne
mother
and
all
those
people
had
seen
it
they
saw
a
pig
and
it
turned
into
a
wee
witch
woman
marise
stopped
thinking
about
that
leaned
forward
and
began
kneading
the
softened
tallow
at
the
upper
end
of
the
candle
father
could
say
all
he
liked
about
candles
being
a
bother
they
were
lots
of
fun
this
part
up
next
the
flame
got
just
right
so
you
could
poke
it
and
it
stayed
put
any
way
you
wanted
it
and
it
was
fun
to
lean
the
candle
over
and
drop
the
melted
tallow
on
your
hands
in
little
drops
that
got
hard
and
you
could
peel
them
off
as
she
poked
at
it
a
dozen
pictures
flickered
through
her
mind
the
bridge
over
the
adour
with
the
river
flowing
yellow
and
strong
under
it
and
the
bright
painted
vessels
loading
and
unloading
the
sister
who
opened
the
door
at
school
always
so
calm
and
silent
the
playground
at
school
with
the
girls
their
faces
twisted
up
with
running
and
screaming
and
catching
each
other
and
the
same
girls
at
their
desks
with
their
faces
all
smoothed
and
empty
looking
up
at
mademoiselle
as
though
they
had
never
thought
of
doing
anything
she
told
them
not
to
the
itself
battered
and
gray
with
age
the
old
black
desks
with
the
slant
lids
that
lifted
up
reverend
mother
stopping
in
to
hear
a
lesson
with
her
old
old
quiet
face
maman
so
pretty
and
stylish
looking
so
sweet
when
she
made
mistakes
in
french
that
nobody
minded
or
thought
of
laughing
at
her
marise
tipped
the
candle
over
carefully
and
let
some
melted
tallow
fall
on
the
back
of
her
hand
as
she
set
it
back
and
waited
for
the
tallow
to
harden
she
was
thinking
how
very
different
from
home
bayonne
was
the
basque
with
the
shiny
fish
in
the
round
flat
baskets
on
their
heads
the
white
oxen
with
the
on
their
horns
and
their
white
canvas
covering
pulling
those
carts
everybody
streaking
it
along
in
canvas
sandals
and
bérets
talking
french
and
basque
and
spanish
and
never
a
word
of
english
and
yet
marise
reflected
as
she
slowly
peeled
off
the
hardened
tallow
drops
none
of
that
was
the
difference
and
there
was
a
real
difference
the
real
difference
was
something
inside
you
you
felt
different
as
if
you
looked
in
the
glass
and
seen
somebody
not
quite
you
it
was
somebody
was
walking
slowly
down
the
hall
to
her
room
it
was
father
heavy
step
that
was
nice
she
had
thought
she
would
see
either
father
or
maman
because
there
had
been
company
to
dinner
again
she
gathered
the
tallow
drops
together
and
dropped
them
in
the
base
of
the
brass
then
she
remembered
that
jeanne
would
scold
if
she
did
that
these
like
everything
else
in
the
house
had
to
be
just
or
everybody
caught
it
she
swept
them
out
again
with
her
fingers
and
stood
holding
them
in
her
hand
looking
around
her
for
some
place
to
put
them
the
basket
was
too
open
they
would
fall
right
through
on
the
floor
and
what
a
fuss
there
would
be
over
that
oh
there
was
the
fireplace
if
you
put
things
way
back
of
the
sticks
jeanne
did
see
them
she
was
just
straightening
up
from
reaching
back
of
the
wood
when
father
came
in
he
said
hello
kid
and
she
answered
hello
poppa
they
did
this
for
a
kind
of
a
joke
to
be
extra
american
when
maman
could
hear
them
father
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
making
a
big
dent
in
the
crimson
quilt
which
jeanne
rounded
so
carefully
each
morning
and
which
she
never
let
anybody
disturb
not
of
course
that
jeanne
would
dare
to
say
anything
to
father
le
patron
she
would
only
grumble
in
basque
under
her
breath
and
marise
would
feel
her
opinion
of
americans
going
down
even
lower
than
it
was
marise
could
always
feel
everybody
opinions
as
they
went
up
and
down
and
how
she
did
hate
to
feel
them
going
down
anybody
about
anything
she
always
tried
to
fix
it
so
they
would
go
up
she
now
planned
to
fluff
the
édredon
to
a
puff
again
after
father
had
gone
back
she
did
say
anything
about
it
to
father
you
never
did
about
that
sort
of
thing
even
maman
did
although
it
made
her
awfully
provoked
not
to
have
father
care
and
she
always
said
a
lot
afterwards
marise
did
even
say
anything
to
him
about
the
white
down
that
would
be
sure
to
work
through
the
cover
of
the
édredon
and
get
on
his
clothes
father
care
if
it
did
there
were
such
lots
of
things
father
did
care
about
but
maman
would
she
must
remember
to
brush
him
off
before
he
went
to
the
salon
having
a
good
time
asked
father
slowly
the
way
he
did
that
let
you
see
how
he
knew
perfectly
well
you
were
not
so
very
she
answered
neither
am
i
he
returned
though
you
need
mention
it
to
momma
there
were
always
a
great
many
things
that
were
not
to
be
mentioned
to
maman
and
a
lot
of
quite
other
things
that
were
not
to
be
mentioned
to
father
and
isabelle
told
her
things
she
did
want
jeanne
to
know
and
that
jeanne
said
was
not
to
be
mentioned
either
to
father
or
maman
marise
coming
back
from
school
used
to
feel
when
she
opened
the
door
of
the
apartment
as
though
she
were
walking
into
cobwebs
spread
around
in
the
dark
and
you
must
on
any
account
brush
into
any
one
of
them
father
now
went
on
what
are
you
doing
with
yourself
marise
looked
down
at
the
cahier
its
pages
as
blank
as
when
she
had
sat
down
her
father
looked
with
her
that
lovely
paper
i
must
say
he
commented
always
with
his
way
of
showing
that
he
meant
just
the
opposite
are
you
supposed
to
write
on
it
in
ink
oh
yes
cried
marise
flashing
up
to
seize
the
chance
of
sympathy
for
one
of
her
grievances
they
let
you
use
because
in
there
a
chance
to
rub
out
your
mistakes
you
not
supposed
to
any
mistakes
does
your
pen
get
stuck
in
it
it
must
be
like
writing
on
said
father
yes
it
does
complained
marise
and
you
spatter
the
ink
all
over
and
break
off
the
tips
of
the
pen
and
everything
and
the
teachers
just
kill
you
if
it
not
perfectly
neat
father
took
up
the
cahier
and
looked
at
the
paper
hard
scratching
it
a
little
with
his
well
there
culture
in
the
air
anyhow
he
said
without
smiling
although
marise
knew
he
was
quoting
maman
he
looked
around
the
room
now
without
saying
anything
more
marise
followed
his
eyes
and
saw
with
him
the
dingy
room
dimly
lighted
by
the
one
weak
the
heavy
figured
tapestry
curtains
drawn
over
the
window
the
draught
although
the
window
was
closed
making
them
suck
in
and
out
the
ugly
ugly
dark
and
scriggly
the
stuffed
red
chair
the
only
comfortable
one
where
jeanne
would
never
let
her
curl
up
with
her
feet
under
her
because
she
said
the
place
for
shoes
was
on
the
floor
the
with
its
little
chipped
white
basin
and
pitcher
like
the
old
things
at
cousin
hetty
the
clock
on
the
that
looked
as
though
it
were
carved
out
of
greasy
soap
with
a
greasy
man
in
a
roman
toga
on
top
of
it
the
shabby
dingy
checked
curtains
hanging
over
the
hooks
where
marise
hung
up
her
dresses
the
tall
dark
armoire
whose
slightly
greenish
mirror
reflected
all
these
things
as
if
you
were
looking
at
them
through
water
and
finally
over
the
bed
the
big
shiny
lithograph
of
our
lady
of
lourdes
in
her
bright
blue
cloak
standing
in
front
of
her
grotto
well
maybe
it
in
the
said
father
he
spoke
in
his
usual
tired
slow
voice
sagging
down
on
the
bed
the
way
he
always
sat
but
then
he
surprised
marise
very
much
and
said
something
she
never
forgot
it
gave
her
such
a
jump
of
astonishment
to
have
father
say
something
as
though
he
really
meant
it
that
she
sat
up
straight
at
his
first
words
staring
at
him
he
said
in
a
strong
voice
but
look
here
molly
there
something
in
the
air
here
by
heck
and
i
wish
get
it
i
mean
the
way
every
one
of
them
in
this
country
keeps
right
after
what
he
doing
till
he
got
it
just
right
that
the
way
to
do
and
we
all
off
the
track
with
our
do
the
way
we
say
back
in
america
it
the
only
thing
in
their
whole
darned
country
can
see
that
do
make
you
sick
now
look
here
kid
you
go
after
it
and
get
it
start
right
in
now
learn
how
to
make
that
infernal
perfectly
all
right
in
spite
of
the
bad
paper
i
wish
to
the
lord
had
been
taught
that
and
then
while
marise
was
still
staring
the
words
echoing
loudly
in
her
ears
because
of
the
strangeness
of
hearing
them
from
father
he
went
on
in
his
usual
voice
it
might
be
to
hold
on
to
and
i
do
see
much
else
marise
had
never
before
known
father
in
any
way
to
try
to
bring
her
up
he
made
maman
so
much
provoked
because
he
always
said
that
he
did
know
any
more
than
marise
how
she
ought
to
be
brought
up
and
he
did
see
that
it
made
so
much
difference
what
you
did
everything
turned
out
about
the
same
in
the
long
run
now
her
little
room
seemed
full
of
the
oddness
of
his
thinking
that
something
did
matter
of
his
telling
her
so
hard
that
he
wished
she
do
something
in
the
loud
silence
which
followed
she
could
hear
his
voice
and
what
it
said
sinking
deeper
and
deeper
into
her
mind
after
a
while
father
yawned
very
wide
and
rubbed
his
hair
forward
and
back
so
that
it
was
all
rumpled
up
the
way
maman
did
like
to
see
it
what
did
you
say
you
were
doing
he
asked
again
i
writing
down
my
leçon
said
marise
your
said
father
my
spelling
lesson
marise
corrected
herself
with
a
jerk
she
knew
how
father
hated
to
have
people
mix
up
their
languages
well
i
do
know
that
you
any
worse
off
at
that
than
we
are
in
the
said
father
he
always
called
the
the
he
added
glancing
at
her
blank
you
got
very
far
i
see
he
paused
and
smiled
a
little
with
one
corner
of
his
mouth
but
then
neither
have
we
in
the
it
came
into
marise
mind
that
perhaps
father
seeing
he
was
so
specially
serious
might
tell
her
some
way
to
keep
her
thoughts
from
jiggling
around
so
from
one
way
of
feeling
to
another
according
to
what
other
people
thought
of
things
instead
of
knowing
what
she
thought
of
things
but
she
had
no
chance
to
ask
him
for
when
she
began
well
i
sort
of
forgot
about
my
spelling
i
got
to
thinking
father
broke
in
as
he
got
up
heavily
to
go
i
would
advise
you
to
do
either
it
never
gets
anybody
anywhere
marise
forgot
till
after
he
had
got
clear
back
to
the
salon
that
she
had
not
brushed
off
the
down
from
the
édredon
maman
would
like
that
a
bit
to
have
him
look
untidy
when
company
was
there
oh
dear
but
she
forgot
this
as
she
thought
again
about
the
queerness
of
seeming
to
care
so
much
about
her
doing
one
thing
rather
than
another
it
was
still
there
this
wonder
at
him
when
she
turned
to
her
book
finally
to
study
that
spelling
lesson
lit
sommier
traversin
she
wrote
the
words
down
on
the
coarse
paper
with
infinite
care
drawing
on
some
deep
unfamiliar
store
of
patience
when
the
pen
sputtered
and
caught
its
point
and
stuck
she
was
going
to
try
to
do
as
father
said
she
would
take
as
much
trouble
with
writing
those
words
about
a
bed
as
old
jeanne
took
in
making
the
bed
every
morning
and
that
was
more
trouble
than
anybody
in
america
ever
took
about
anything
her
dark
shining
hair
fell
forward
about
her
cheeks
as
she
leaned
over
the
writing
slowly
chewing
her
tongue
frowning
in
her
concentration
on
the
formation
of
those
letters
she
forgot
all
about
her
uncertainties
as
to
how
things
really
were
she
forgot
her
loneliness
all
her
flickering
thoughts
steadied
themselves
and
grew
quiet
as
she
worked
a
stillness
came
over
her
she
felt
happier
than
she
had
since
they
came
to
france
to
live
later
ever
so
much
later
after
she
had
undressed
washed
in
the
cold
water
in
the
little
basin
gone
to
bed
and
to
sleep
the
jeanne
in
to
see
that
she
was
all
right
this
jeanne
was
very
different
from
all
the
others
because
she
was
so
quiet
marise
up
when
she
felt
the
energetic
french
kiss
on
her
cheek
jeanne
always
kissed
you
so
hard
and
as
she
dozed
off
again
she
heard
jeanne
saying
a
prayer
over
her
half
in
basque
and
half
in
latin
marise
could
understand
either
latin
or
basque
but
she
understood
the
intention
of
that
nightly
prayer
at
her
bed
and
she
caught
sleepily
at
old
jeanne
to
return
her
kiss
it
was
as
good
as
cousin
taking
you
on
her
lap
and
putting
her
arms
around
you
but
it
was
enough
sight
better
than
nothing
also
she
heard
jeanne
carefully
close
the
window
jeanne
always
did
this
every
night
although
maman
said
to
leave
it
open
jeanne
was
the
last
one
in
there
always
so
she
had
it
her
way
she
did
think
it
healthy
to
let
night
air
into
rooms
marise
was
too
sleepy
to
get
up
and
open
it
again
anyhow
jeanne
often
told
her
about
the
evil
spirits
that
come
in
through
open
bedroom
windows
and
sit
on
your
chest
and
suck
your
life
into
their
black
bodies
as
you
sleep
marise
did
not
believe
this
in
the
least
of
course
and
yet
chapter
viii
i
may
two
plump
ladies
with
large
busts
and
very
small
waists
were
sitting
in
the
salon
of
the
allen
apartment
waiting
for
the
mistress
of
the
house
they
wore
very
dresses
of
excellent
silk
obviously
not
new
obviously
made
by
the
sort
of
little
dressmaker
who
goes
from
house
to
house
their
shoes
were
stout
and
clumsy
their
hats
somewhat
heavy
in
line
their
gloves
exquisitely
fitting
perfectly
fresh
made
of
the
leather
although
the
sky
was
blue
each
lady
carried
a
small
silk
umbrella
of
the
very
best
quality
tightly
rolled
with
a
masterly
smoothness
as
smoothly
tubular
as
the
day
it
was
bought
the
two
women
held
their
cruelly
corseted
bodies
very
erect
and
sat
squarely
on
their
chairs
both
feet
on
the
floor
their
knees
close
together
their
backbones
very
straight
under
the
brims
of
their
heavy
hats
their
fresh
healthy
faces
wore
an
expression
of
perfect
stability
they
knew
that
they
produced
exactly
the
impression
they
meant
to
produce
and
that
they
looked
exactly
like
what
they
were
from
every
inch
of
them
was
proclaimed
the
fact
that
they
were
fine
housekeepers
and
economical
managers
of
their
husbands
incomes
that
they
were
of
the
bourgeoisie
and
proud
of
it
as
of
everything
else
they
were
and
did
they
looked
out
on
their
lives
and
found
them
good
in
every
detail
from
their
slightly
and
purposely
dresses
to
their
stout
shoes
evidence
of
their
respectability
from
their
fixed
ideas
to
their
excellent
gloves
they
glanced
about
them
now
keenly
with
the
penetrating
survey
of
the
professional
good
housekeeper
and
found
much
to
comment
on
how
strange
to
have
no
lace
curtains
over
the
windows
only
the
heavy
ones
at
the
side
why
people
outside
must
be
able
to
right
do
you
suppose
they
have
taken
them
out
to
be
washed
or
do
they
know
about
curtains
in
america
they
murmured
their
remarks
in
a
low
tone
keeping
a
cocked
to
the
hall
that
is
disgraceful
it
was
on
when
the
charpentiers
lived
here
lapagorry
had
expected
you
know
of
course
to
do
this
apartment
over
after
the
charpentiers
moved
out
but
these
new
people
never
made
a
single
comment
or
complaint
just
accepted
it
i
daresay
they
are
used
to
at
home
with
indians
at
the
door
oh
no
madame
garnier
my
henri
says
that
the
indians
are
quite
civilized
in
america
now
madame
garnier
frowned
slightly
at
the
mention
of
henri
the
other
woman
went
on
apparently
they
thought
it
was
all
right
to
have
faded
paper
and
those
awful
old
curtains
lapagorry
was
so
astonished
he
almost
fell
over
backward
and
when
he
saw
they
find
fault
with
anything
he
asked
a
higher
rent
ever
so
much
higher
than
the
charpentiers
had
paid
and
they
took
too
without
a
word
people
say
lapagorry
ca
sleep
nights
now
because
he
did
ask
more
madame
garnier
observed
as
one
mentioning
an
obvious
fact
oh
well
madame
fortier
he
will
of
course
next
time
madame
fortier
saw
nothing
to
smile
at
in
this
yes
of
course
she
said
seriously
madame
garnier
now
said
they
must
be
rich
where
is
it
they
are
from
buenos
aires
oh
no
madame
garnier
i
think
it
is
somewhere
in
north
america
my
henri
says
that
madame
garnier
broke
in
irritated
to
say
with
suppressed
heat
oh
north
america
or
south
america
what
the
difference
they
are
all
foreigners
and
who
knows
what
strange
immoral
ideas
they
have
they
do
come
to
mass
you
know
it
would
surprise
me
to
learn
that
the
man
is
a
i
wish
garnier
had
not
asked
me
to
call
on
them
the
other
shrugged
her
shoulders
resignedly
yes
it
a
very
strange
thing
to
do
make
the
first
call
and
on
people
you
know
nothing
about
but
fortier
says
the
man
allen
is
very
important
in
a
business
way
and
he
specially
asked
all
the
business
men
to
have
their
wives
call
on
his
wife
he
almost
seemed
to
make
it
a
sort
of
condition
so
fortier
said
almost
made
them
promise
before
he
would
talk
business
with
them
it
may
be
in
america
they
do
and
of
course
anything
fortier
thinks
may
be
good
for
his
business
madame
garnier
nod
signified
that
of
course
that
principle
went
without
saying
for
any
good
wife
the
expression
of
her
face
adding
that
this
was
an
application
of
it
which
might
count
as
one
of
a
good
sacrifices
but
she
said
hopefully
well
they
wo
stay
very
long
foreigners
never
do
madame
fortier
now
murmured
they
say
she
very
free
with
the
gentlemen
fortier
and
his
friends
are
laughing
about
her
they
say
they
really
do
know
how
much
of
what
she
says
is
due
to
her
bad
french
or
how
far
she
really
does
expect
them
to
go
this
did
not
surprise
madame
garnier
what
can
you
expect
i
shall
see
to
it
that
our
has
nothing
to
do
with
them
this
apparently
started
a
new
train
of
thought
for
madame
fortier
for
she
now
said
with
the
cheery
warmth
of
one
who
brings
out
something
which
will
be
a
bitter
pill
to
her
interlocutor
it
seems
the
american
allen
has
taken
quite
a
fancy
to
our
henri
we
think
we
can
get
a
position
for
henri
through
him
in
america
where
henri
can
learn
english
and
study
the
american
market
it
would
be
a
great
help
in
the
business
if
henri
knew
english
and
all
about
american
imports
and
of
course
the
salaries
paid
in
america
are
enormous
madame
garnier
eyes
opened
wide
she
fell
into
a
meditation
and
presently
murmured
our
made
quite
a
specialty
of
english
in
the
lycée
i
should
think
the
mother
of
henri
shook
her
head
decidedly
i
do
think
america
would
suit
your
temperament
she
said
he
not
at
all
practical
and
you
get
skinned
alive
by
american
business
men
if
not
as
sharp
as
they
no
you
better
keep
away
from
them
the
two
looked
at
each
other
hard
a
brilliant
light
of
rivalry
came
into
their
eyes
it
brought
an
animation
a
zest
into
their
faces
which
made
them
look
years
younger
a
had
been
touched
and
all
their
wheels
began
visibly
to
turn
steps
were
heard
in
the
hall
they
composed
their
faces
and
turned
towards
the
door
the
american
lady
now
came
in
and
they
rose
to
greet
her
they
were
extremely
cordial
a
competitive
friendliness
in
their
manner
they
went
down
the
oaken
stairs
in
silence
each
holding
up
her
long
heavy
skirt
with
one
gloved
hand
and
letting
the
other
rest
on
the
railing
at
the
bottom
each
with
an
automatic
gesture
like
a
reflex
action
looked
at
the
palm
of
her
glove
to
see
if
it
had
been
soiled
by
the
railing
and
with
a
similar
mechanical
action
shook
their
heads
disapprovingly
although
there
was
not
a
grain
of
dust
on
the
smooth
pale
kid
they
shook
out
the
trains
of
their
skirts
and
swept
into
the
street
conscious
of
the
pouncing
inspection
of
anna
etchergary
gazing
at
them
from
the
loge
of
the
concierge
and
proudly
aware
that
there
was
nothing
to
criticize
in
any
detail
of
their
backs
or
anywhere
else
about
them
they
turned
to
the
left
and
began
to
climb
the
steep
street
which
led
towards
the
cathedral
madame
fortier
remarked
presently
very
bad
taste
that
dress
like
an
actress
all
that
white
silk
and
lace
and
slippers
like
a
dancing
girl
it
must
be
she
never
puts
her
hand
to
anything
in
the
house
no
she
does
returned
the
other
disapprovingly
my
marguerite
meets
her
jeanne
every
morning
at
market
she
says
that
jeanne
says
the
american
lady
never
does
anything
about
the
house
and
does
even
verify
her
accounts
you
can
just
imagine
what
jeanne
is
getting
out
of
it
it
quite
upsets
marguerite
and
i
have
to
be
specially
careful
with
my
own
accounts
everybody
near
them
is
getting
a
on
everything
she
made
these
revelations
with
a
satisfied
look
as
though
the
words
had
a
pleasant
taste
in
her
mouth
madame
fortier
comment
was
made
with
the
accent
of
mature
worldly
experience
mark
my
words
money
spent
in
a
loose
careless
way
like
that
have
been
ill
come
that
the
way
disreputable
women
spend
money
it
very
hard
on
the
rest
of
us
at
any
rate
and
jeanne
tells
our
margot
that
she
is
a
very
poor
housekeeper
as
heedless
as
a
child
wears
her
best
tailored
street
dress
in
the
house
as
like
as
not
lies
down
on
the
bed
when
she
is
not
sick
at
all
and
does
do
a
thing
but
read
novels
all
the
time
or
fool
away
a
whole
afternoon
in
the
museum
very
suspicious
that
too
why
should
anybody
go
to
the
museum
so
much
i
just
like
to
know
whom
she
meets
there
a
regular
place
of
rendezvous
the
museum
i
wonder
if
her
husband
knows
they
were
enjoying
the
conversation
so
much
that
their
faces
looked
quite
sunny
and
bright
the
other
shook
her
head
forebodingly
there
was
a
silence
as
they
climbed
steadily
up
the
steep
narrow
street
then
madame
garnier
remarked
the
little
girl
is
quite
pretty
though
so
mannerless
her
dress
was
covered
with
grease
spots
and
had
a
hook
off
the
back
reported
madame
fortier
i
did
see
but
grease
spots
demurred
madame
garnier
and
she
really
has
lovely
eyes
and
hair
how
badly
that
woman
speaks
french
without
the
little
girl
to
interpret
it
would
actually
have
been
hard
to
know
what
she
was
saying
strange
they
do
know
french
better
but
perhaps
they
do
have
regular
schools
like
ours
madame
garnier
made
no
answer
to
this
conjecture
but
asked
looking
sideways
at
her
neighbor
shall
you
ask
them
to
dinner
madame
fortier
all
but
groaned
and
said
in
a
martyr
tone
oh
i
suppose
so
for
henri
sake
the
other
digested
this
thrust
in
silence
and
then
changed
the
subject
what
was
that
she
was
saying
about
de
maupassant
was
she
quoting
him
to
what
did
she
take
us
for
yes
she
did
realize
what
we
might
think
of
her
it
was
that
indecent
too
but
she
knows
so
little
french
most
likely
she
did
understand
what
it
was
all
about
have
you
read
that
asked
madame
garnier
yes
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
as
a
mother
to
know
what
it
is
but
i
burned
the
book
and
you
may
be
sure
do
go
around
letting
everybody
know
i
read
it
did
you
find
her
pretty
madame
garnier
answered
obliquely
but
quite
understandably
i
daresay
a
man
would
think
so
i
could
think
of
anything
but
her
manners
how
she
lolled
in
her
chair
and
crossed
her
legs
i
would
want
my
gabrielle
to
see
her
and
to
my
eyes
she
had
a
faded
look
queer
her
being
so
fair
i
do
see
any
trace
of
indian
blood
i
thought
all
americans
had
indian
blood
oh
no
madame
garnier
my
henri
says
that
madame
garnier
made
a
gesture
of
one
thoroughly
out
of
patience
with
henri
and
ended
the
conversation
abruptly
oh
here
we
are
at
the
corner
i
must
turn
down
here
madame
fortier
ii
may
the
rosy
wrinkled
face
of
the
sister
of
charity
shone
out
from
the
white
quilled
band
over
which
the
black
veil
was
draped
beside
her
the
distinguished
old
lady
showed
under
her
long
crape
veil
a
face
as
quiet
as
that
of
the
nun
the
two
elderly
women
sat
at
ease
their
hands
folded
in
their
laps
chatting
in
a
pleasant
low
tone
yes
so
every
one
says
a
great
deal
of
money
madame
la
marquise
said
the
nun
in
her
murmuring
monotone
as
all
americans
have
the
other
breathed
out
with
a
great
wistful
sigh
oh
soeur
ste
lucie
if
only
the
good
god
has
sent
us
at
last
the
opportunity
to
get
our
chapel
yes
yes
indeed
assented
the
nun
drawing
in
her
breath
sharply
between
her
teeth
she
raised
her
eyes
singularly
bright
and
personal
in
her
professionally
passive
face
they
say
there
is
a
child
too
perhaps
a
soul
to
save
our
mother
superior
always
so
zealous
for
the
honor
of
our
order
has
asked
us
specially
specially
the
bishop
has
so
much
to
say
about
one
of
the
sisters
of
the
francis
order
because
of
the
conversion
of
a
swedish
sailor
whom
she
nursed
in
their
hospital
the
mother
superior
hopes
very
much
that
some
one
in
order
yes
yes
i
understand
said
the
great
lady
nodding
the
nun
went
on
deferentially
madame
la
marquise
is
so
good
to
be
willing
to
come
to
call
on
the
foreign
lady
i
shall
see
to
it
that
the
foreign
lady
understands
the
honor
done
her
the
other
made
a
graceful
deprecatory
gesture
with
a
shapely
hand
and
explained
with
great
simplicity
and
gentleness
oh
no
ma
soeur
it
is
nothing
nothing
to
praise
i
would
make
a
far
greater
sacrifice
for
the
sake
of
our
beloved
work
but
in
this
case
there
is
no
risk
of
being
misunderstood
it
is
not
as
though
they
were
french
bourgeois
who
might
have
their
heads
turned
there
can
be
no
question
of
social
equality
with
transient
foreigners
she
smiled
bowed
her
head
with
humility
and
said
so
you
see
dear
soeur
ste
lucie
that
i
deserve
no
praise
for
making
a
sacrifice
the
nun
nodded
her
understanding
it
was
evident
that
they
understood
each
other
to
perfection
yes
yes
of
course
i
see
no
social
equality
possible
she
murmured
drawing
in
a
sharply
taken
breath
again
they
looked
about
them
in
silence
now
the
restrained
calm
of
their
faces
uncolored
by
their
thoughts
hearing
steps
in
the
hall
soeur
ste
lucie
shook
out
her
long
black
sleeves
to
cover
her
hands
more
completely
and
cast
down
her
eyes
so
that
her
sweet
rosy
wrinkled
old
face
was
once
more
blank
and
impassive
anna
etchergary
was
waiting
at
the
door
of
her
loge
as
they
descended
the
stairs
and
she
ran
before
them
out
to
the
old
closed
carriage
which
stood
at
the
curb
bowing
deferentially
and
murmuring
under
her
breath
madame
la
marquise
she
held
the
door
open
for
them
the
lady
smiled
her
thanks
at
her
a
smile
which
took
for
granted
the
deference
and
the
service
as
the
nun
stepped
into
the
carriage
she
said
with
unction
now
i
see
how
lives
in
the
world
can
be
as
useful
to
our
lady
as
those
of
the
convent
no
one
could
have
resisted
madame
this
afternoon
to
have
a
great
name
and
all
worldly
graces
and
to
use
them
only
for
the
greater
glory
of
our
lady
the
other
sighed
and
said
sadly
dear
ste
lucie
since
the
death
of
my
dear
one
there
is
nothing
for
me
in
the
life
of
the
world
except
an
opportunity
to
serve
our
good
work
she
went
on
more
cheerfully
with
a
little
animation
yes
i
must
say
it
seemed
like
fruitful
ground
this
afternoon
fruitful
ground
i
think
we
may
say
we
made
a
good
beginning
the
old
coachman
came
to
the
door
for
his
orders
to
rue
marengo
in
the
petit
bayonne
said
his
mistress
and
as
he
stepped
to
his
seat
she
explained
to
the
nun
i
feel
so
much
encouraged
that
i
am
going
straight
to
an
architect
to
have
him
make
an
estimate
of
what
the
chapel
would
cost
the
carriage
proceeded
very
slowly
and
rackingly
over
the
rounded
boulders
of
the
pavement
inside
it
the
two
women
accustomed
to
such
joltings
thrust
their
arms
through
the
broad
hanging
loops
and
went
on
talking
not
a
disagreeable
person
said
the
great
lady
in
a
kind
tone
of
tolerance
a
very
little
woman
but
no
harm
in
her
i
should
say
i
was
afraid
to
find
some
one
not
quite
not
quite
you
know
it
is
said
that
american
women
are
not
very
moral
so
many
divorces
in
america
and
still
you
went
breathed
the
nun
lost
in
admiration
of
the
other
heroic
devotion
when
you
ran
the
risk
of
meeting
a
woman
the
marquise
made
another
gentle
fatigued
gesture
of
warding
off
praise
it
was
a
practised
gesture
as
though
she
had
occasion
to
make
it
often
after
a
time
she
said
odd
she
should
be
so
interested
in
the
cathedral
here
and
yet
a
what
made
her
talk
so
much
about
the
south
portal
i
never
heard
of
anything
unusual
about
it
did
you
except
that
that
disagreeable
fountain
is
somewhere
near
there
to
the
memory
of
those
wicked
revolutionists
the
nun
shook
her
head
indifferently
i
always
enter
by
the
north
portal
she
said
i
do
believe
i
ever
happened
to
see
the
south
one
after
reflection
the
marquise
said
i
do
believe
i
ever
saw
it
either
why
should
any
one
you
never
enter
from
that
side
nobody
lives
on
the
rue
that
anybody
would
ever
have
occasion
to
visit
iii
may
anna
etchergary
measured
accurately
the
social
status
of
the
two
ladies
who
asked
for
madame
allen
apartment
and
without
getting
up
or
stopping
her
sewing
she
answered
in
the
careless
tone
suitable
for
people
who
wore
hats
and
cotton
gloves
that
madame
allen
was
at
the
top
of
the
first
flight
after
they
had
passed
she
thought
to
herself
that
she
believed
she
knew
them
mlle
hasparren
the
and
her
married
sister
they
were
basques
like
anna
but
of
the
small
government
employee
class
who
put
on
airs
of
gentility
and
wore
hats
and
leather
shoes
mlle
hasparren
gave
music
lessons
as
well
as
teaching
school
probably
she
had
come
to
try
to
be
taken
on
as
marise
the
two
ladies
were
mounting
the
stairs
in
silence
and
very
slowly
because
the
had
taken
off
her
cotton
gloves
and
was
putting
on
a
pair
of
kid
ones
which
she
had
pulled
from
her
she
explained
to
her
sister
who
had
only
cotton
gloves
it
to
do
honor
to
america
and
then
with
a
long
breath
the
first
american
i
ever
saw
what
do
you
care
if
it
is
rachel
asked
her
sister
languidly
she
added
with
more
animation
your
hat
is
over
one
ear
again
the
other
stopped
short
on
a
stair
america
free
america
she
said
passionately
do
you
remember
what
voltaire
said
can
never
be
wholly
a
prison
so
long
as
it
has
america
for
open
window
she
knocked
her
hat
back
into
place
with
the
effect
of
using
the
gesture
to
emphasize
violently
what
she
said
i
would
quote
voltaire
if
i
were
you
advised
her
sister
mildly
you
never
know
who
may
be
listening
people
think
badly
enough
of
you
for
being
a
in
a
as
it
is
there
you
are
rachel
caught
this
up
as
a
point
for
her
side
there
it
is
our
airless
stagnant
european
of
prejudice
she
struck
a
hand
gloved
in
kid
now
on
her
breast
with
the
gesture
of
one
suffocating
her
sister
shrugged
her
shoulders
resignedly
and
said
which
door
do
you
suppose
it
is
we
forgot
to
ask
which
side
they
were
now
on
the
landing
hesitating
between
the
two
exactly
similar
doors
rachel
made
a
quick
decision
at
random
crossed
to
the
side
and
pulled
the
the
door
opened
and
showed
the
upright
frame
of
jeanne
amigorena
there
was
a
moment
of
mutual
surprise
and
exclamations
of
greeting
and
inquiry
why
jeanne
you
here
i
thought
you
were
on
the
farm
at
midassoa
jeanne
broke
out
upon
them
with
a
great
rush
of
basque
enchanted
to
see
familiar
faces
enchanted
to
have
a
new
audience
oh
madame
hardoye
mlle
hasparren
who
ever
would
think
to
see
you
here
yes
here
i
am
in
a
family
of
the
queerest
foreigners
you
ever
saw
but
they
pay
very
well
they
have
both
apartments
on
this
floor
yes
they
must
be
of
money
and
i
have
little
isabelle
from
midassoa
with
me
as
femme
de
chambre
and
what
do
you
think
we
have
each
a
room
a
real
furnished
bedroom
just
as
though
we
were
guests
the
madame
took
one
look
at
the
maids
rooms
under
the
roof
on
the
fifth
floor
you
know
and
when
she
saw
they
are
all
dark
except
that
little
with
no
furniture
to
speak
of
she
said
she
let
a
dog
sleep
there
the
idea
it
would
have
been
plenty
good
enough
for
isabelle
and
enough
sight
better
than
what
she
ever
had
at
home
she
is
getting
beyond
herself
all
the
time
isabelle
is
i
have
an
awful
time
keeping
her
in
her
place
the
lady
has
the
least
idea
of
doing
it
they
are
such
queer
people
i
ca
tell
you
she
knows
no
more
about
taking
care
of
a
child
our
madame
she
started
to
let
our
little
mademoiselle
go
to
school
through
the
and
the
poor
child
was
so
disgraceful
with
spots
and
dirt
on
her
dresses
that
i
was
ashamed
to
have
people
see
her
and
had
madame
buy
her
some
aprons
and
now
i
keep
her
in
order
myself
she
is
a
sweet
child
only
brought
up
the
way
you
expect
a
little
savage
to
be
puts
her
on
the
or
else
sits
on
the
and
on
the
street
or
else
loiters
along
looking
at
but
she
is
learning
fast
i
complain
oh
no
i
know
well
enough
that
when
you
are
a
servant
you
must
take
what
comes
to
you
and
make
the
best
of
it
but
i
never
thought
i
would
work
in
a
family
of
still
they
sleep
over
there
on
that
side
of
the
landing
and
isabelle
and
i
sleep
here
i
keep
the
shell
well
filled
and
we
brought
the
branch
of
box
from
home
that
had
been
blessed
last
palm
sunday
and
we
sprinkle
a
few
drops
of
lourdes
water
on
the
table
before
we
eat
i
hope
we
are
safe
le
curé
says
that
is
enough
i
often
think
that
madame
hardoye
had
been
listening
to
this
flood
of
talk
her
lively
interest
in
the
matter
struggling
with
her
distaste
for
familiar
manner
she
now
broke
in
with
an
accent
which
she
meant
to
express
there
you
talked
quite
enough
after
all
though
my
sister
has
queer
ideas
we
are
not
in
your
class
we
are
not
peasants
and
it
high
time
you
remembered
that
what
she
actually
said
in
a
curt
tone
was
where
do
we
ring
to
make
a
call
on
your
mistress
jeanne
understood
the
implication
perfectly
it
was
one
quite
familiar
to
her
with
a
change
of
manner
she
motioned
them
silently
across
the
hall
there
she
said
laconically
her
face
suddenly
hard
and
somber
rachel
hasparren
also
understood
the
implication
and
flushed
an
even
more
vivid
color
than
that
habitually
on
her
dark
cheeks
she
held
out
her
hand
her
hand
to
jeanne
with
a
defiant
gesture
of
equality
jeanne
i
glad
we
had
a
glimpse
of
you
jeanne
took
the
hand
awkwardly
with
a
sort
of
rancorous
reluctance
to
have
her
grievance
appeased
and
turning
back
shut
the
door
behind
her
now
rachel
expostulated
her
sister
rachel
breathed
ragingly
and
stared
at
her
sister
in
an
old
resentment
which
the
other
took
calmly
looking
inside
her
rachel
advanced
provocatively
did
you
hear
what
old
jeanne
said
how
the
american
lady
would
not
put
a
dog
to
sleep
in
lodgings
in
which
we
french
expect
to
house
our
servants
the
married
sister
resented
this
spiritedly
spoiling
servants
for
the
rest
of
us
that
what
it
is
she
said
impatiently
and
what
good
does
it
do
you
saw
how
old
jeanne
only
thinks
the
less
of
her
for
it
the
more
you
try
to
do
for
that
class
the
less
they
think
of
you
that
because
jeanne
whole
nature
has
been
degraded
by
our
caste
ideals
shouted
rachel
she
a
poor
superstitious
medieval
old
thing
incapable
of
ordinary
decent
human
relations
if
she
lived
in
america
angèle
pulled
the
other
here
with
an
air
of
cutting
short
another
and
they
both
stood
silently
looking
at
the
closed
door
which
presently
was
opened
by
little
isabelle
as
they
went
down
the
stairs
angèle
remarked
well
she
seems
to
be
all
right
like
everybody
else
as
far
as
i
can
see
i
expected
to
see
her
with
a
liberty
cap
on
her
head
and
swinging
a
lighted
bomb
to
hear
you
going
on
rachel
was
taking
off
her
kid
gloves
and
putting
on
cotton
ones
she
said
dreamily
her
black
eyes
deep
and
glowing
when
i
asked
her
how
the
peasants
lived
in
america
she
said
the
dear
american
are
any
peasants
in
america
her
dark
flushed
face
was
shining
as
they
came
out
on
the
rue
thiers
and
stood
for
an
instant
glancing
up
at
the
battlemented
walls
of
the
dark
old
castle
rachel
suddenly
shook
her
fist
at
it
her
fist
and
cried
out
you
need
glower
down
like
that
you
hideous
old
relic
of
an
evil
past
there
a
great
wide
rich
country
across
the
seas
that
never
heard
of
such
as
you
that
never
had
a
feudal
castle
in
it
that
is
darkened
by
a
single
hateful
shadow
such
as
you
still
throw
down
on
us
here
hush
rachel
said
her
sister
patiently
attempting
to
quiet
her
anna
etchergary
is
looking
out
of
the
window
at
us
rachel
instantly
lowered
her
voice
with
an
instinctive
response
of
caution
to
this
warning
but
she
was
furious
that
she
had
done
so
that
europe
that
europe
for
you
she
said
hotly
under
her
breath
spied
upon
every
minute
by
suspicious
mean
malicious
eyes
angèle
broke
in
on
her
to
say
reasonably
well
anyhow
your
hat
is
on
one
side
again
chapter
ix
letter
to
horace
allen
neighbors
and
friends
in
belton
new
bayonne
france
may
mes
chére
amies
je
vous
demande
pardon
for
being
so
late
with
this
letter
i
know
i
promised
to
write
just
as
soon
as
we
got
here
but
chére
amies
i
know
you
would
forgive
me
if
you
knew
how
our
new
life
is
here
in
this
old
beautiful
world
i
have
just
been
letting
myself
go
in
it
just
at
its
charm
and
wonder
and
all
i
can
tell
you
is
that
europe
is
even
more
than
i
thought
i
just
wish
every
one
of
you
could
persuade
your
husbands
as
i
did
to
take
a
position
that
will
bring
you
across
the
seas
to
this
fabled
old
land
of
story
and
art
owe
it
to
your
to
give
them
the
culture
which
they
would
get
here
but
let
me
begin
first
with
the
material
things
allen
you
know
felt
sort
of
badly
because
the
position
here
did
seem
to
be
as
important
and
have
as
big
a
salary
as
the
job
the
company
offered
him
in
chicago
well
you
can
not
imagine
anything
like
the
cheapness
of
the
life
here
we
have
two
flats
of
six
rooms
each
on
the
same
floor
just
the
landing
between
them
twelve
rooms
in
all
furnished
elaborately
down
to
the
last
little
things
in
the
kitchen
even
and
we
pay
about
half
the
rent
we
paid
in
belton
for
our
unfurnished
house
there
is
perhaps
a
little
dinginess
about
the
and
the
curtains
and
things
but
that
only
adds
to
the
delightful
and
makes
you
realize
that
you
are
really
in
old
europe
and
not
raw
young
america
we
have
two
maids
for
than
three
dollars
a
each
and
such
maids
in
america
we
have
any
idea
what
it
is
to
have
good
servants
i
am
not
expected
to
lift
my
hand
or
think
about
the
housekeeping
my
old
cook
the
most
creature
in
a
quaint
costume
takes
the
responsibility
on
her
own
shoulders
she
gets
up
frightfully
early
in
the
morning
and
goes
off
to
market
with
a
big
flat
basket
and
comes
bringing
it
in
her
all
filled
with
the
loveliest
things
to
eat
you
ever
saw
and
bought
for
almost
nothing
but
she
buys
just
as
closely
for
me
as
she
would
for
herself
servants
identify
themselves
with
the
family
of
their
masters
here
and
are
glad
to
i
know
the
word
masters
sounds
very
but
one
so
soon
gets
used
to
the
vocabulary
of
the
country
pardonnez
moi
jeanne
that
is
our
cook
brings
our
breakfast
to
us
all
except
of
course
for
allen
who
ca
seem
to
adapt
himself
to
other
ways
of
living
the
first
morning
when
she
started
to
he
just
jumped
out
of
bed
as
though
the
house
were
on
fire
and
slammed
the
door
shut
in
her
face
he
ca
get
over
his
prudishness
but
we
have
separate
rooms
now
and
i
have
my
tray
in
bed
and
read
my
mail
there
and
between
you
and
me
it
makes
me
feel
just
like
a
heroine
in
a
novel
to
lie
there
in
my
pretty
negligée
you
know
in
america
we
do
realize
what
negligées
are
for
when
do
you
ever
have
a
chance
to
wear
one
except
when
you
are
sick
and
then
you
do
care
marise
has
hers
her
breakfast
i
mean
in
her
room
too
as
she
dresses
and
jeanne
always
expects
to
help
her
dress
so
i
do
have
to
think
at
all
about
getting
her
off
to
school
oh
mes
amies
a
rest
to
one
nerves
that
is
not
to
have
that
horrid
hurried
hour
trying
to
find
clothes
and
books
and
get
marise
off
in
time
i
just
lie
in
bed
reading
the
mail
or
a
book
and
marise
comes
in
all
fresh
and
combed
jeanne
is
wonderful
with
her
hair
and
kisses
me
and
says
au
revoir
maman
we
always
try
to
speak
french
together
for
the
practice
then
as
i
am
getting
dressed
jeanne
comes
in
with
a
clean
apron
to
take
her
orders
in
the
good
old
european
way
and
from
that
minute
on
i
have
no
more
bother
about
it
everything
is
set
on
the
table
at
the
right
time
beautifully
cooked
the
house
is
kept
clean
and
in
the
most
order
perhaps
you
are
wondering
why
i
call
mary
marise
it
is
a
quaint
nickname
for
her
that
the
servants
have
and
i
have
picked
it
up
from
them
is
it
delightful
i
never
liked
mary
and
i
detest
molly
both
the
maids
are
devoted
to
marise
and
it
is
the
european
custom
for
the
servants
to
do
a
great
deal
more
for
the
children
of
the
house
than
our
girls
ever
dream
of
doing
without
a
word
jeanne
has
simply
taken
over
the
care
of
marise
clothes
as
a
part
of
her
regular
work
and
she
is
always
ready
to
go
out
with
her
for
it
seems
that
no
nice
children
go
alone
on
the
streets
here
every
morning
jeanne
takes
marise
to
her
school
and
goes
for
her
in
the
afternoon
and
brings
her
back
marise
is
perfectly
happy
here
in
a
splendid
school
and
having
wonderful
opportunities
i
am
so
happy
about
her
advantages
it
is
not
a
public
school
the
lay
schools
as
they
say
because
all
the
others
are
run
by
catholic
nuns
it
seems
the
public
schools
are
something
quite
new
in
france
and
nobody
sends
children
to
them
except
the
poor
or
people
who
are
queer
in
some
way
with
unbalanced
ideas
i
can
easily
believe
this
since
i
had
a
call
the
other
day
from
a
in
the
public
schools
who
also
gives
music
lessons
she
is
a
very
queer
and
dowdy
person
with
the
most
awful
hat
you
ever
saw
did
you
think
that
all
frenchwomen
wore
pretty
stylish
hats
not
in
the
least
quite
the
contrary
her
sister
was
with
her
quite
both
of
them
and
not
at
all
like
the
other
ladies
who
have
called
on
me
for
they
called
do
you
remember
that
little
old
french
teacher
who
came
to
see
me
about
getting
a
job
in
our
high
school
how
discouraging
she
was
about
our
coming
to
live
in
france
and
how
she
said
nobody
would
come
to
see
me
at
all
well
if
you
ever
see
her
just
tell
her
she
is
people
are
just
as
cordial
as
can
with
the
most
beautiful
manners
you
ever
saw
do
you
wonder
how
i
manage
about
the
language
it
is
easier
to
get
along
than
i
expected
of
course
my
thorough
reading
and
writing
knowledge
of
the
language
is
a
great
help
and
i
have
been
making
progress
in
speaking
it
being
right
in
the
midst
of
the
language
all
the
time
it
just
soaks
into
you
no
one
here
speaks
any
english
not
from
provincial
ignorance
the
sort
we
have
in
america
but
from
choice
because
of
their
concentration
on
their
own
perfect
language
they
are
all
deeply
cultured
it
is
to
be
in
the
midst
of
cultured
people
to
be
able
in
casual
afternoon
calls
to
discuss
de
maupassant
with
one
lady
and
gothic
architecture
with
another
for
we
have
here
in
bayonne
you
notice
that
i
already
say
we
a
simply
splendid
gothic
cathedral
the
first
one
of
my
life
it
is
right
up
the
street
from
where
we
live
and
it
is
chére
amies
think
what
it
means
for
a
town
to
have
in
its
midst
such
a
marvelous
thing
think
what
people
must
be
like
who
live
right
close
to
it
go
in
and
out
of
it
every
day
and
feel
its
beauty
and
puissant
power
as
matthew
arnold
says
the
south
portal
is
especially
fine
by
which
means
a
great
deal
as
you
know
i
make
a
pilgrimage
there
every
day
to
just
at
that
south
portal
have
a
of
arrears
to
make
up
not
having
lived
with
it
from
childhood
as
these
fortunate
people
have
it
is
no
wonder
that
you
meet
here
people
absolutely
in
their
polish
like
a
lady
who
called
on
me
the
other
day
the
marquise
de
charmières
her
family
dates
back
to
the
days
of
louis
xii
i
am
ashamed
to
say
i
had
to
go
and
look
up
who
louis
xii
was
after
she
had
gone
she
had
with
her
a
nun
who
lives
with
her
by
special
permission
the
dearest
old
thing
with
her
sweeping
black
robes
and
the
quaint
quilled
picturesque
i
suppose
they
used
in
the
old
days
the
charmières
did
to
live
in
the
old
castle
just
across
the
street
from
us
which
is
another
of
my
great
admirations
think
of
living
across
the
street
from
a
real
castle
it
was
constructed
in
on
the
remains
of
the
roman
if
you
please
for
bayonne
is
very
very
old
and
it
is
right
there
just
the
way
it
always
was
with
battlements
and
a
real
drawbridge
and
everything
just
as
it
was
in
feudal
times
many
famous
people
have
lived
there
richard
coeur
de
lion
louis
quatorze
and
others
it
was
there
that
catherine
de
medicis
planned
the
bartholomew
massacre
and
in
a
house
on
this
very
street
that
napoleon
took
the
spanish
crown
away
from
the
king
and
gave
it
to
his
brother
is
it
marvelous
to
think
of
i
have
had
some
of
the
curtains
taken
down
in
our
the
french
simply
swathe
their
windows
in
curtains
simply
them
and
i
often
stand
at
the
window
and
just
gaze
out
at
those
old
castle
walls
and
try
to
imagine
the
splendid
life
that
went
on
here
then
the
streets
full
of
people
in
costumes
and
knights
in
armor
and
everything
i
see
the
modern
crowds
coming
and
going
under
those
massive
walls
and
i
keep
thinking
how
proud
they
must
be
of
such
an
inheritance
from
the
past
and
how
they
must
often
wish
the
good
old
feudal
days
back
again
when
life
had
color
as
a
writer
said
in
a
book
i
was
reading
the
other
day
no
such
inspiriting
reminders
of
past
glories
in
america
no
such
past
glories
nothing
but
what
ruskin
calls
the
drab
dead
level
of
democracy
there
is
a
fine
museum
here
too
with
perfectly
splendid
works
of
art
in
it
pictures
by
van
dyck
rembrandt
raphael
rubens
ribera
murillo
poussin
delacroix
ingres
troyon
meissonier
corot
isabey
bonnat
bouguereau
gervex
and
many
others
i
am
simply
them
absorbing
them
i
go
every
day
with
a
handbook
on
art
which
i
bought
here
in
french
of
course
and
just
gaze
at
them
till
their
very
spirit
enters
into
me
i
must
tell
you
that
bouguereau
is
considered
very
much
out
of
fashion
here
and
not
at
all
admired
any
more
the
meissonier
are
simply
you
could
take
a
microscope
to
them
and
still
not
see
any
indeed
it
is
said
that
he
painted
with
a
microscope
there
is
a
copy
here
of
the
mona
lisa
which
people
who
know
say
is
just
as
good
as
the
original
mes
chére
amies
think
what
a
privilege
it
is
to
sit
there
right
before
her
with
the
book
in
my
hand
looking
up
into
that
mysterious
face
and
reading
those
wonderful
words
of
pater
which
i
have
studied
with
you
so
often
here
is
the
head
upon
which
all
the
ends
of
the
world
are
come
and
the
eyelids
are
a
little
weary
she
is
older
than
the
rocks
among
which
she
sits
like
the
vampire
she
has
been
dead
many
times
and
learned
the
secrets
of
the
grave
and
has
been
a
diver
in
deep
seas
and
keeps
their
fallen
day
about
her
and
trafficked
for
strange
webs
with
eastern
merchants
and
as
leda
was
the
mother
of
helen
of
troy
and
as
ste
anne
the
mother
of
mary
and
all
this
has
been
to
her
but
as
the
sound
of
lyres
and
flutes
and
lives
only
in
the
delicacy
with
which
it
has
molded
the
changing
lineaments
and
tinged
the
eyelids
and
the
hands
mes
amies
we
have
often
read
and
studied
this
marvelous
passage
together
and
now
i
can
only
say
to
you
it
is
but
every
bit
of
culture
means
so
much
more
to
me
than
it
ever
did
before
and
now
that
i
know
what
european
life
is
i
can
understand
why
they
are
more
cultured
than
we
are
it
is
because
they
have
here
the
working
classes
to
as
our
american
working
class
does
not
and
the
material
cares
are
just
taken
right
off
the
shoulders
of
the
upper
classes
are
to
occupy
ourselves
with
higher
things
i
am
reading
reading
reading
as
never
before
and
getting
a
closer
knowledge
of
french
literature
even
than
our
studies
together
gave
me
it
all
so
much
more
to
me
now
that
i
am
right
among
the
very
people
who
are
described
in
it
think
of
looking
up
from
a
volume
of
zola
and
having
a
caller
come
in
who
might
be
a
character
right
out
of
the
book
i
often
tell
allen
that
the
life
around
me
illustrates
and
explains
the
literature
and
the
literature
illustrates
and
explains
the
life
it
is
a
wonderful
experience
i
have
just
finished
de
maupassant
notre
coeur
and
i
am
not
surprised
that
we
found
it
impossible
to
get
hold
of
the
french
edition
in
america
our
puritanic
america
know
enough
to
appreciate
such
a
picture
of
this
european
world
where
relations
between
men
and
women
are
different
from
those
between
high
school
boys
and
girls
at
home
the
girls
rule
the
roost
if
you
will
excuse
a
vulgar
expression
but
not
here
here
they
are
put
off
in
a
corner
till
they
get
a
husband
and
they
are
allowed
to
blossom
out
a
woman
of
my
age
so
a
french
gentleman
told
me
the
other
day
is
considered
at
the
right
for
being
fascinating
and
he
assured
me
he
did
say
that
because
it
might
apply
to
me
but
it
is
the
men
have
temperament
here
they
really
look
at
you
and
are
just
as
different
as
can
be
from
the
american
who
never
thinks
of
any
woman
but
his
wife
and
never
pays
any
attention
to
here
the
men
positively
sparkle
in
conversation
and
they
all
say
they
would
hardly
know
i
am
an
american
i
have
acquired
the
french
manner
so
entirely
here
a
woman
is
not
expected
to
have
become
a
mummy
because
she
puts
on
a
the
i
assure
you
but
this
is
a
terribly
long
letter
i
have
poured
out
my
heart
to
you
in
untrammeled
spontaneity
such
as
comes
to
you
in
the
free
intellectuality
of
this
finished
civilization
may
you
all
be
able
some
day
to
enjoy
it
your
devouée
friend
flora
allen
mr
allen
says
the
business
part
seems
to
be
all
right
chapter
x
as
happens
to
us
all
there
were
certain
moments
which
stayed
alive
in
marise
memory
for
years
and
as
is
always
the
case
those
moments
did
not
at
all
correspond
with
apparently
important
events
such
events
come
seem
of
great
consequence
happen
and
therewith
sink
down
into
the
featureless
mass
of
things
which
happen
only
once
and
then
are
in
the
past
forever
the
other
moments
those
queerly
heterogeneously
impressions
are
the
things
which
happen
over
again
every
time
one
thinks
of
them
one
of
marise
fantastic
notions
was
that
the
things
which
had
happened
were
piled
up
in
a
big
in
your
memory
in
front
of
a
great
black
curtain
but
there
were
pinholes
in
the
curtain
and
if
you
put
your
eye
to
one
there
right
before
you
one
of
the
things
that
had
happened
was
alive
again
and
your
heart
knocked
and
your
throat
felt
queer
just
as
it
did
the
first
time
this
notion
may
have
come
to
her
in
this
form
because
it
was
generally
in
the
night
that
she
experienced
the
vivid
of
some
long
past
moment
wakened
from
a
sound
sleep
by
the
hoarse
whistle
of
one
of
the
steamers
in
the
adour
taking
advantage
of
a
favorable
tide
to
weigh
anchor
and
be
off
she
saw
in
the
instant
while
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
turned
over
in
bed
one
of
those
living
scenes
again
as
actual
as
piercingly
real
to
her
as
though
it
were
happening
for
the
first
time
some
of
these
she
greatly
dreaded
some
set
her
to
ringing
all
through
with
happiness
others
she
never
understood
at
all
i
one
of
the
very
happy
ones
was
the
moment
when
she
had
first
really
heard
music
she
had
been
taking
lessons
of
mlle
hasparren
for
weeks
and
months
mlle
hasparren
taught
as
marise
thought
all
the
teachers
in
france
taught
the
hardest
possible
way
scales
scales
scales
and
then
thumping
monotonous
exercises
played
over
forty
fifty
sixty
times
till
marise
felt
as
though
there
was
anything
left
of
her
except
that
exercise
pound
pound
pound
all
over
her
marise
saw
nothing
in
music
except
hatefully
numerous
little
black
dots
on
white
paper
and
heard
nothing
in
it
beyond
a
combination
of
sounds
as
interesting
to
hear
as
a
problem
in
arithmetic
is
to
look
at
she
rather
liked
mlle
hasparren
although
maman
thought
she
did
have
a
bit
of
style
but
she
certainly
did
hate
the
music
lesson
she
never
could
have
kept
on
with
it
in
america
but
here
everything
was
hard
work
and
if
you
were
working
at
your
music
lesson
they
expect
you
to
be
working
at
something
else
and
then
too
there
was
what
father
had
said
about
keeping
at
what
you
were
doing
until
you
got
it
just
right
marise
seemed
to
have
taken
up
the
sound
of
father
voice
as
he
said
that
so
that
many
times
as
she
sat
there
doing
her
lessons
and
not
thinking
of
it
all
of
a
sudden
the
very
curtains
and
walls
and
chairs
seemed
to
be
reminding
her
of
it
that
was
really
what
kept
her
going
as
day
by
day
she
sat
down
heavily
before
the
piano
prodding
her
mind
up
to
keep
it
fixed
on
the
little
black
dots
that
at
least
was
what
had
kept
her
at
it
till
the
evening
which
came
back
to
marise
so
clearly
father
and
maman
had
gone
out
to
dinner
she
had
eaten
alone
with
jeanne
chatter
for
company
and
then
on
her
way
back
to
her
room
had
wandered
into
the
salon
in
hand
sort
of
hoping
she
could
think
of
something
nice
to
do
before
she
settled
down
to
study
but
there
was
certainly
nothing
nice
to
do
in
the
salon
it
was
awfully
lonely
in
there
the
chairs
all
empty
and
stiff
standing
around
heavily
the
thick
curtains
drawn
close
over
the
tall
windows
and
in
front
of
the
alcove
where
maman
stood
the
polished
floor
shining
hard
and
bright
the
stands
the
table
with
one
of
books
on
it
the
dark
little
cave
of
a
fireplace
marise
set
her
candle
down
on
a
stand
and
herself
sank
down
on
the
piano
stool
her
back
towards
the
keys
staring
at
the
lonesome
looking
room
how
perfectly
dead
it
did
look
marise
could
hear
faintly
in
the
distance
an
echo
of
the
brisk
voice
of
jeanne
and
isabelle
laughing
and
carrying
on
over
the
dishes
but
in
here
in
the
empty
salon
there
was
a
sound
her
ears
fairly
rang
with
the
nothingness
all
around
her
her
heart
was
big
and
heavy
at
school
that
day
the
girls
had
started
up
a
new
fad
the
wishbook
you
got
a
little
blank
book
and
then
went
around
asking
everybody
to
write
down
in
it
what
she
most
wished
to
be
marise
was
astonished
at
what
the
other
girls
wrote
one
i
wish
i
could
be
a
great
actress
another
i
wish
i
could
marry
a
millionaire
another
i
wish
i
could
be
a
great
and
holy
saint
marise
had
not
been
able
to
understand
why
everybody
did
not
write
what
she
did
instantly
instantly
something
she
had
always
known
she
wanted
what
she
had
written
in
book
was
i
wish
i
could
be
happy
she
thought
of
this
now
and
in
the
empty
cold
echoing
room
cried
it
aloud
i
wish
i
could
be
happy
there
was
no
answer
from
the
stiff
stuffed
chairs
from
the
tables
from
the
black
hole
of
the
fireplace
marise
had
expected
no
answer
would
not
have
expected
one
if
her
parents
had
been
there
never
expected
one
what
answer
could
father
give
father
who
apparently
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
as
being
happy
and
never
hoped
for
anything
more
than
to
be
a
little
less
tired
and
bored
and
if
maman
had
been
there
she
would
even
have
heard
what
marise
said
busy
as
she
always
was
with
thinking
something
of
her
own
maman
was
nearly
so
cheerful
as
she
had
been
what
it
maman
was
thinking
about
when
she
sat
so
still
and
her
face
got
dark
and
drawn
certainly
not
about
marise
the
little
girl
sat
on
the
piano
stool
dangling
her
long
legs
and
looking
straight
ahead
into
the
empty
room
which
looked
back
at
her
she
thought
as
though
it
had
a
low
opinion
of
her
and
a
very
high
opinion
of
its
own
importance
and
elegance
she
knew
she
ought
to
get
up
and
go
into
her
own
room
and
study
a
very
long
lesson
on
the
reign
of
henri
iv
but
she
could
seem
to
get
up
the
strength
to
do
this
sitting
fallen
together
on
the
piano
stool
her
heart
heavier
and
heavier
she
looked
hard
at
the
empty
chairs
and
thought
to
herself
that
it
was
any
worse
to
see
them
empty
than
to
see
the
people
that
usually
sat
on
them
not
one
who
could
help
a
little
girl
to
be
more
happy
there
was
a
single
person
she
knew
whom
she
wish
sitting
there
now
unless
it
might
be
cousin
hetty
marise
felt
a
knot
come
in
her
throat
and
the
corners
of
her
mouth
began
to
tremble
she
would
to
get
up
in
cousin
hetty
lap
again
but
cousin
hetty
was
not
there
there
was
nothing
there
but
the
circle
of
unfriendly
chairs
and
tables
and
the
empty
silent
room
the
trembling
of
her
lips
got
worse
marise
was
afraid
she
was
going
to
cry
she
turned
round
on
the
piano
stool
put
one
bent
arm
up
on
the
music
which
stood
there
and
hid
her
face
in
it
she
was
not
crying
though
she
wished
she
could
because
the
ache
in
her
heart
and
the
knot
in
her
throat
hurt
too
much
the
silent
motionless
room
stood
aloof
and
meaningless
about
the
silent
motionless
child
marise
pressed
her
face
closer
against
her
arm
she
was
trembling
now
all
over
her
body
the
silence
was
intense
and
then
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
silence
had
been
broken
by
a
voice
a
beautiful
quivering
voice
deep
and
true
which
went
straight
to
her
heart
as
though
some
one
had
spoken
a
strong
loving
word
at
the
sound
she
stopped
trembling
and
sat
motionless
before
she
could
draw
her
breath
in
wonder
she
knew
what
it
had
been
only
a
note
of
music
her
own
hand
falling
on
a
key
of
the
piano
had
struck
a
note
which
was
even
then
echoing
in
her
ears
but
the
first
impression
was
ineffaceable
that
too
rang
in
her
ears
it
seemed
as
though
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
heard
a
note
of
music
really
really
that
was
so
she
had
never
been
enough
before
to
hear
how
a
note
sounded
how
it
rang
and
rang
in
the
stillness
its
deep
vibration
stirring
echoes
deep
within
heart
she
had
thought
it
was
a
voice
why
it
was
like
a
voice
a
voice
speaking
to
her
just
when
she
had
been
so
sure
that
there
any
voice
she
could
possibly
expect
to
hear
she
sat
up
marveling
and
struck
another
note
into
the
dead
stagnant
air
of
the
room
and
into
her
loneliness
it
sang
out
bravely
the
same
living
voice
thrilling
and
speaking
to
her
she
struck
a
chord
astonished
at
what
she
heard
in
it
all
those
separate
voices
each
one
rich
and
true
and
strong
and
different
from
the
others
and
all
shouting
together
in
glorious
friendliness
that
the
way
things
to
be
thought
marise
that
the
way
ought
to
be
but
oh
how
little
they
were
like
that
but
here
was
a
world
where
she
could
always
make
it
come
true
where
she
could
have
that
any
time
she
wished
to
make
it
for
herself
she
struck
more
chords
her
fingers
finding
the
keys
with
the
sureness
learned
in
her
months
of
dreary
practice
she
listened
to
the
sounds
shaken
and
transported
to
hear
how
they
flooded
the
barren
emptiness
of
the
room
with
glory
how
they
filled
her
heart
full
full
of
happiness
only
if
she
were
happy
why
was
she
crying
the
tears
running
as
fast
as
they
could
down
her
cheeks
this
was
one
of
the
remembered
moments
which
brought
nothing
but
a
pang
of
joy
to
marise
when
it
came
the
world
about
her
brightened
ii
there
was
another
one
of
those
which
came
very
seldom
which
brought
something
deeper
than
pain
or
joy
this
was
the
recollection
of
an
instant
just
one
instant
of
the
day
when
maman
let
soeur
ste
lucie
take
her
to
lourdes
it
was
the
feast
of
louis
and
soeur
ste
lucie
always
went
every
year
then
she
had
been
awfully
nice
and
jolly
the
way
she
always
was
with
marise
and
it
was
fun
to
start
off
with
her
early
in
the
morning
at
dawn
in
the
special
excursion
train
at
lourdes
it
was
fun
too
really
exciting
to
be
in
such
a
monstrously
big
crowd
oh
a
crowd
she
heard
somebody
tell
soeur
ste
lucie
that
there
were
thirty
thousand
pilgrims
there
that
day
it
amused
marise
very
much
to
hear
them
called
pilgrims
and
to
think
that
she
and
soeur
ste
lucie
were
counted
as
pilgrims
too
she
had
always
thought
of
pilgrims
as
people
who
landed
on
a
stern
and
coast
and
began
to
fight
with
indians
and
nothing
could
be
more
unlike
that
than
the
crowd
at
lourdes
swimming
in
the
dusty
yellow
sunshine
everybody
dressed
up
in
his
best
walking
around
in
groups
talking
and
singing
marise
held
on
to
the
sister
nice
soft
old
hand
and
followed
her
around
from
one
thing
to
another
taking
a
good
big
drink
of
the
water
and
kneeling
down
whenever
soeur
ste
lucie
stopped
to
pray
before
a
shrine
marise
did
pray
much
but
watched
the
crowd
the
endless
crowd
shuffling
slowly
past
she
was
proud
to
be
kneeling
there
beside
a
sister
who
had
the
right
of
entrance
everywhere
who
opened
any
gate
in
any
railing
she
liked
and
walked
right
in
to
say
a
prayer
where
the
common
run
of
people
did
dare
go
at
noon
after
three
hours
of
this
soeur
ste
lucie
took
her
charge
off
up
along
the
bright
stream
off
into
the
real
country
till
finally
they
came
to
a
field
that
was
too
thick
with
people
there
they
sat
down
on
the
grass
under
a
tree
soeur
ste
lucie
got
out
the
pasteboard
they
had
taken
turns
carrying
around
all
the
morning
and
they
ate
their
lunch
marise
was
simply
starving
by
that
time
and
anything
would
have
tasted
good
but
that
lunch
would
have
made
a
stone
statue
eat
it
was
so
good
cold
roast
chicken
plenty
of
it
big
slices
cut
recklessly
right
off
the
breast
tender
and
juicy
and
and
crispy
crunchy
rolls
and
fresh
butter
and
little
radishes
and
green
onions
and
salt
and
a
half
bottle
of
the
best
white
wine
which
they
watered
down
in
their
cups
with
lourdes
water
soeur
ste
lucie
laughed
over
this
as
she
poured
it
out
and
said
they
ought
to
be
saints
at
least
for
a
day
or
so
after
drinking
lourdes
water
with
their
lunch
ought
they
she
was
as
jolly
as
could
be
anyhow
and
was
enjoying
herself
so
much
that
she
kept
marise
laughing
at
her
jokes
all
the
time
one
of
those
numerous
friends
of
hers
turned
up
here
too
a
stout
farmer
wife
who
shouted
with
pleasure
at
seeing
soeur
ste
lucie
and
came
over
from
the
other
side
of
the
field
to
bring
her
lunch
and
eat
with
them
she
and
soeur
ste
lucie
got
into
gales
of
laughter
in
which
marise
joined
with
all
her
heart
although
she
did
always
quite
see
what
the
joke
was
then
they
had
their
dessert
a
triangle
of
creamy
camembert
cheese
spread
on
the
crust
end
of
their
roll
and
after
this
a
great
golden
pear
apiece
so
full
of
sweet
juice
that
you
could
take
a
bite
of
it
without
its
running
down
your
chin
so
you
had
to
lean
way
forward
to
the
tune
of
everybody
laughing
at
you
and
doing
the
same
thing
themselves
after
they
had
packed
up
what
was
left
and
the
farmer
woman
had
gone
back
to
her
family
soeur
ste
lucie
got
very
quiet
and
still
pulled
out
her
rosary
and
began
to
murmur
her
prayers
in
a
very
fast
low
tone
her
eyes
almost
shut
up
marise
sat
beside
her
in
the
grass
watched
the
crowds
beginning
to
turn
back
towards
the
basilica
and
a
couple
of
little
gnats
dancing
round
and
round
each
other
in
the
air
the
murmur
of
the
prayers
was
like
a
in
her
ears
she
leaned
back
against
the
tree
and
drew
a
long
breath
and
the
next
thing
she
knew
it
was
hours
later
and
soeur
ste
lucie
was
shaking
her
gently
and
saying
she
better
wake
up
because
it
was
time
to
go
back
if
they
were
going
to
get
a
place
to
see
the
blessing
of
the
sick
after
that
ceremony
was
over
everybody
was
perfectly
worn
out
and
almost
starved
soeur
ste
lucie
went
to
one
of
the
convents
for
supper
where
the
good
sisters
took
care
of
hundreds
of
the
pilgrims
and
looked
as
tired
as
marise
felt
and
walked
as
though
their
feet
hurt
as
hers
did
but
there
was
still
one
more
lourdes
sight
to
see
the
procession
of
the
lights
in
the
evening
when
they
came
out
of
the
convent
they
found
the
weather
changed
the
wind
blowing
hard
and
a
light
rain
falling
and
not
a
bit
of
light
coming
from
the
black
black
sky
the
damp
was
bad
for
rheumatism
and
soeur
ste
lucie
knee
began
to
pain
her
so
that
she
said
they
would
not
march
in
the
procession
but
go
up
along
the
side
of
the
high
staircase
where
they
could
see
on
both
sides
and
along
the
esplanade
how
black
and
empty
that
looked
that
enormous
stretch
of
pavement
like
a
great
empty
hole
outlined
by
the
street
lights
on
all
four
sides
of
it
back
of
it
down
towards
the
grotto
there
seemed
to
be
millions
of
people
judging
by
the
lights
which
danced
around
every
way
at
once
and
through
the
wind
and
the
rain
and
the
darkness
marise
and
soeur
ste
lucie
could
hear
snatches
of
singing
the
chant
which
fairly
rings
from
the
stones
and
walls
of
lourdes
music
then
as
marise
stuck
her
head
through
the
railing
to
watch
what
went
on
there
far
far
below
them
she
saw
the
lights
begin
to
straighten
out
into
two
long
lines
and
start
streaming
up
the
lower
part
of
the
staircase
where
she
and
soeur
ste
lucie
stood
the
procession
had
started
two
by
two
they
were
marching
up
towards
the
blaze
of
light
at
the
top
where
the
door
of
the
upper
church
stood
open
the
sound
of
their
voices
grew
louder
and
louder
and
there
they
were
the
first
ones
were
a
mother
and
her
little
girl
after
them
a
couple
of
working
men
after
them
a
man
and
his
wife
after
them
a
priest
and
a
soldier
after
them
after
them
marise
lost
count
she
felt
her
head
whirl
she
could
see
the
people
any
more
only
the
little
dancing
quivering
lights
they
were
carrying
scarcely
at
all
protected
from
the
wind
by
a
bit
of
or
a
hand
curved
about
them
they
kept
going
by
and
going
by
those
little
flames
until
eyes
ached
and
yet
she
could
look
at
anything
else
she
stop
staring
at
those
flickering
swaying
little
flames
after
a
long
time
she
was
able
to
pull
her
eyes
away
from
them
to
look
past
them
down
at
the
great
esplanade
and
oh
now
it
was
not
a
black
and
empty
hole
it
was
all
full
full
of
lights
a
million
little
marching
and
singing
flames
in
endless
lines
ordered
purposeful
marching
to
and
fro
so
small
so
tiny
and
feeble
each
one
but
enough
all
together
to
make
a
great
light
in
the
blackness
to
fill
all
the
emptiness
with
glory
it
was
then
that
the
terrible
great
moment
came
to
marise
something
that
she
could
never
think
about
long
enough
to
try
to
understand
because
when
she
tried
to
think
about
it
she
began
to
shake
all
over
just
as
she
had
then
when
across
the
line
of
chanting
pilgrims
she
looked
down
at
all
those
little
marching
singing
flames
what
was
it
that
came
to
her
then
the
most
aching
sorrow
and
yet
an
exaltation
as
though
broad
wings
were
lifting
her
up
in
a
solemn
beat
of
power
it
was
all
over
in
an
instant
whenever
it
came
after
that
it
always
came
and
went
between
but
after
it
had
come
and
gone
everything
looked
different
it
was
as
though
plodding
along
on
foot
a
great
wind
had
snatched
her
up
and
blowing
mightily
for
an
instant
so
that
all
the
world
was
filled
with
it
had
set
her
down
ever
so
much
farther
along
the
road
she
had
to
go
and
always
after
this
moment
she
had
an
hour
or
so
when
she
liked
people
better
everybody
the
dirty
old
the
jeanne
the
teachers
at
school
father
and
maman
it
was
as
though
she
saw
them
all
in
a
procession
each
trying
to
keep
alive
a
precious
flickering
flame
iii
there
was
another
a
horrid
one
from
which
marise
always
looked
away
the
instant
she
knew
it
was
coming
because
she
could
bear
it
and
yet
she
never
could
be
quick
enough
she
always
saw
it
as
though
in
her
as
in
a
camera
a
lens
had
whirringly
clicked
open
and
shut
and
yet
there
was
nothing
to
it
she
had
come
from
school
with
jeanne
who
had
gone
to
the
kitchen
marise
had
crossed
the
landing
and
started
to
pull
the
and
then
noticed
that
the
door
happened
to
be
a
little
ajar
so
she
pushed
it
open
and
walked
in
as
she
walked
past
the
salon
door
she
had
glanced
in
and
saw
fortier
there
just
going
away
from
making
a
call
the
father
of
elise
fortier
her
classmate
at
school
he
had
his
broad
fat
back
turned
to
her
and
was
stooping
to
kiss
maman
hand
there
was
nothing
surprising
in
this
everybody
knew
that
gentlemen
who
kept
on
with
the
old
ways
of
doing
things
always
kissed
ladies
hands
she
had
seen
the
father
of
one
of
the
girls
kiss
the
bony
hand
of
mlle
ballot
the
head
teacher
at
school
what
was
registered
indelibly
on
marise
mind
was
the
expression
on
face
maman
was
looking
oh
it
was
horrid
to
think
such
a
thing
to
say
such
a
thing
to
have
looked
at
her
and
seen
such
a
thing
maman
was
looking
sort
of
marise
could
never
try
as
she
might
shut
down
on
this
moment
quickly
enough
to
shut
out
the
ugly
thought
she
hated
so
maman
was
looking
sort
of
foolish
and
silly
as
though
as
though
but
here
marise
was
always
able
to
snap
the
shutter
shut
and
put
it
all
out
of
her
mind
except
the
dull
heaviness
it
left
iv
but
the
worst
the
very
worst
and
most
awful
of
all
those
remembered
parts
of
the
past
was
what
happened
about
the
gray
cat
no
that
was
the
way
to
put
it
because
you
could
say
that
anything
had
and
yet
how
sick
it
had
made
marise
and
did
every
time
something
reminded
her
of
it
one
day
when
marise
came
home
from
school
jeanne
gave
her
a
big
pretty
gray
cat
and
said
she
thought
it
might
be
company
for
her
marise
was
awfully
pleased
took
the
cat
in
her
arms
bending
her
cheek
down
to
rest
it
against
the
soft
fur
and
carried
her
off
to
her
room
to
try
to
get
acquainted
with
her
but
there
seemed
to
be
something
the
matter
she
did
act
like
cousin
hetty
tommy
up
in
ashley
nice
and
cuddlesome
she
seemed
to
have
something
on
her
mind
she
would
sit
still
on
marise
lap
and
be
petted
she
would
play
with
a
string
nor
drink
the
milk
marise
put
in
a
saucer
for
her
nor
lie
down
and
go
to
sleep
the
cozy
way
cats
usually
do
she
tramped
around
and
around
the
room
and
every
once
in
a
while
she
give
a
loud
miauw
in
an
anxious
voice
marise
thought
it
was
because
she
was
with
strangers
in
a
strange
place
and
that
as
she
grew
wonted
she
would
be
happier
but
she
kept
this
up
all
that
day
and
at
night
when
marise
shut
her
up
in
the
extra
kitchen
they
did
use
she
yowled
so
that
maman
complained
and
the
next
day
she
was
even
worse
acting
so
queer
doing
such
funny
things
stooping
her
front
paws
down
and
tramping
hard
with
her
back
paws
and
as
she
did
this
she
would
look
up
at
marise
and
miauw
in
a
loud
anxious
way
as
though
she
were
asking
marise
to
do
something
for
her
at
the
end
of
that
second
day
marise
was
too
worried
to
keep
it
to
herself
although
she
had
resolved
not
to
bother
either
maman
or
jeanne
because
they
did
like
cats
she
went
across
the
landing
to
ask
jeanne
to
come
jeanne
came
and
isabelle
too
instantly
sure
of
the
worst
as
usual
and
declaring
that
the
man
who
had
sold
them
the
cat
was
a
thief
and
a
robber
and
had
palmed
off
on
them
a
sick
cat
that
nobody
wanted
they
added
emphatic
precautions
to
marise
about
not
touching
her
if
she
was
sick
because
a
sick
cat
bite
meant
poison
they
went
into
the
room
the
cat
got
up
and
came
towards
them
that
same
queer
way
stooping
and
treading
and
switching
her
tail
and
she
gave
again
that
strange
anxious
cry
there
that
the
way
she
does
all
the
time
said
marise
troubled
and
concerned
she
came
round
in
front
of
the
two
women
so
that
she
could
look
full
up
into
their
two
faces
to
see
what
they
thought
not
a
turn
or
color
or
tone
or
line
of
what
they
looked
and
said
and
did
ever
faded
from
her
mind
her
first
feeling
as
she
looked
up
into
their
faces
was
of
utter
amazement
and
after
this
an
instant
cold
premonition
of
something
evil
she
stood
perfectly
still
gazing
at
them
what
could
it
mean
what
made
them
look
so
jeanne
and
isabelle
looked
down
at
the
cat
the
anger
went
out
of
their
faces
and
in
its
place
came
a
singular
secret
expression
half
amused
half
marise
could
never
think
of
any
other
name
for
it
then
they
looked
at
each
other
their
eyes
meeting
their
eyebrows
arched
high
and
they
laughed
at
the
sort
of
laugh
they
gave
marise
burned
hot
all
over
although
she
had
no
idea
of
what
there
could
be
to
laugh
at
but
every
line
of
the
two
women
bodies
and
faces
the
tone
of
their
laugh
the
look
of
their
glistening
amused
eyes
told
her
that
it
was
something
they
thought
shameful
and
she
was
ashamed
then
as
she
stood
there
cold
and
burning
hot
they
had
both
as
by
a
common
impulse
glanced
at
her
as
if
something
about
her
also
seemed
very
funny
to
them
that
glance
was
the
worst
of
all
like
a
smear
she
could
never
wipe
off
she
felt
very
sick
her
knees
shook
under
her
but
something
furious
and
strong
inside
her
told
her
that
whatever
else
she
did
she
must
not
let
them
see
how
sick
they
made
her
she
stood
her
ground
her
eyes
burning
utterly
at
a
loss
what
could
it
be
what
was
this
awful
joke
they
laughed
at
and
she
could
see
jeanne
said
as
they
looked
at
the
cat
with
a
greedy
amusement
in
their
eyes
oh
she
not
she
looking
for
a
husband
that
all
isabelle
laughed
again
at
this
and
said
something
to
jeanne
in
basque
marise
could
not
understand
a
word
of
this
but
her
hot
straining
eyes
fixed
on
their
two
faces
with
a
helpless
fascination
received
another
deep
and
indelible
impression
of
conscious
shamefulness
jeanne
nodded
and
said
to
marise
i
take
her
back
to
for
a
few
days
where
there
are
other
cats
and
then
she
be
all
right
again
she
picked
the
cat
up
by
the
middle
and
held
her
so
while
she
listened
to
isabelle
who
now
said
something
else
in
basque
her
lips
curled
in
an
embarrassed
way
jeanne
glanced
sharply
at
marise
as
if
to
see
whether
she
had
understood
this
in
spite
of
its
being
said
in
basque
then
they
both
went
out
of
the
room
jeanne
carrying
the
cat
by
a
hard
careless
grasp
about
her
middle
outside
the
door
they
both
burst
into
giggles
as
though
they
had
been
restraining
themselves
before
marise
the
little
girl
heard
them
giggling
all
the
way
down
the
hall
the
sound
broken
once
by
the
loud
anxious
miauw
of
the
cat
marise
stood
perfectly
still
till
she
heard
the
outer
door
open
and
close
then
she
looked
about
her
wildly
she
wanted
to
run
somewhere
and
hide
her
face
she
wanted
to
sink
down
on
the
floor
she
wanted
somebody
to
help
her
to
make
it
up
to
her
some
one
to
wipe
it
away
and
put
her
back
where
she
had
been
three
minutes
before
when
jeanne
and
isabelle
had
come
in
the
door
she
go
on
living
the
way
she
felt
now
as
though
she
were
dirty
inside
and
could
wash
herself
clean
what
was
it
all
about
what
had
it
meant
what
was
there
about
having
a
husband
that
people
thought
was
so
at
this
it
came
over
her
in
a
wave
again
so
that
she
started
as
though
she
had
been
struck
a
slashing
blow
and
ran
ran
breathlessly
out
to
get
help
in
the
dark
hall
she
stood
still
the
thump
thump
of
her
heart
loud
in
her
ears
a
murmur
of
voices
came
from
the
salon
maman
had
callers
but
even
if
she
had
marise
now
knew
she
could
not
have
spoken
to
maman
about
it
something
came
and
stood
between
her
and
maman
so
that
she
knew
she
could
not
tell
her
she
had
a
horrible
fear
that
maman
would
look
that
way
too
perhaps
she
might
laugh
that
way
perhaps
everybody
would
perhaps
that
was
one
of
the
things
they
not
father
either
no
she
be
ashamed
of
not
why
there
was
she
could
tell
there
was
nowhere
to
run
for
help
she
went
slowly
back
to
her
room
the
sight
of
it
brought
up
before
her
again
the
glistening
eyes
of
the
two
women
as
they
had
looked
at
the
cat
and
laughed
a
terrible
burning
came
up
all
over
her
so
that
she
was
almost
suffocated
she
wanted
to
hide
her
face
she
found
herself
leaning
against
the
dingy
checked
curtains
they
smelled
of
dust
as
she
buried
her
face
in
them
burrowing
deeper
and
deeper
among
them
as
though
she
must
hide
herself
hide
herself
from
but
she
could
hide
herself
from
what
was
inside
her
own
mind
she
stood
there
a
long
time
her
face
pressed
into
the
dusty
curtains
her
body
buried
in
them
she
was
sick
sick
from
head
to
foot
and
then
nobody
came
to
help
her
since
there
was
nobody
to
come
nothing
happened
nothing
could
happen
she
had
thought
she
live
feeling
like
this
but
she
would
have
to
since
there
was
anything
else
to
do
this
came
to
her
slowly
and
slowly
sank
into
her
like
still
deep
cold
two
days
after
this
as
jeanne
was
brushing
her
hair
she
said
to
marise
our
cat
will
be
brought
back
to
us
she
is
all
right
now
bergeret
says
marise
waited
until
the
wave
of
sickness
passed
and
she
felt
she
could
make
her
voice
sound
as
usual
then
she
said
casually
i
changed
my
mind
i
do
want
a
cat
now
it
would
bother
maman
too
much
jeanne
was
relieved
oh
very
well
i
do
ask
anything
better
i
hate
cats
around
the
house
anyhow
she
went
on
brushing
marise
hair
with
careful
loving
skill
proud
of
its
thickness
its
sheen
its
silky
blackness
she
thought
to
herself
what
a
beautiful
child
our
marise
is
and
how
i
love
her
there
is
anything
i
would
do
for
her
may
the
holy
virgin
guard
her
and
keep
her
safe
always
amen
she
never
thought
again
of
the
cat
begins
to
be
chapter
xi
on
neale
thirteenth
birthday
his
mother
gave
him
a
little
silver
watch
and
his
father
a
bicycle
in
addition
to
the
excitement
of
getting
into
his
teens
and
of
owning
these
visible
and
outward
symbols
of
advancement
he
was
told
that
he
would
now
be
sent
to
a
real
school
with
no
girls
in
the
classes
where
he
would
really
learn
something
that
is
to
say
where
he
would
be
prepared
for
college
hadley
prep
was
an
excellent
school
a
sort
of
model
school
an
information
factory
you
fed
a
small
boy
into
it
and
at
the
end
of
four
years
the
school
turned
him
out
completely
filled
with
classified
information
boys
entered
with
all
sorts
of
hazy
disorders
of
learning
they
were
ground
out
possessed
of
a
chain
of
facts
every
link
shining
polished
and
joined
by
flawless
welding
to
the
preceding
and
consequent
facts
the
curriculum
took
no
count
of
modern
educational
fads
spiritual
awakening
character
building
intellectual
growth
had
no
place
there
what
would
you
have
four
years
is
a
short
enough
time
to
prepare
boys
for
their
college
entrance
examinations
the
had
to
be
cut
out
the
great
point
was
that
when
the
principal
signed
a
certificate
of
graduation
he
knew
that
the
boy
in
question
could
produce
any
piece
of
information
required
of
him
from
the
preterit
of
recevoir
to
the
formula
for
accelerated
motion
of
falling
bodies
at
any
college
entrance
examination
in
the
united
states
into
the
hopper
of
this
mental
neale
was
poured
with
fifty
other
little
boys
and
began
painfully
to
adapt
himself
to
its
rigorous
codes
it
was
a
process
trying
to
the
most
robust
among
them
and
devastating
to
the
weaker
ones
the
devastating
quality
was
not
only
recognized
and
admitted
but
sedulously
fostered
by
the
faculty
and
principal
it
was
part
of
their
business
to
see
that
the
weaklings
fell
by
the
wayside
long
before
the
flock
was
led
up
to
the
narrow
gate
of
the
college
entrance
examinations
and
as
some
hospitals
achieve
a
miraculously
low
by
the
simple
process
of
never
admitting
a
patient
whom
they
are
not
sure
they
can
cure
so
hadley
prep
achieved
the
miraculously
low
rate
of
examination
mortality
for
which
it
was
famous
the
country
over
by
the
simple
process
of
knocking
on
the
head
and
throwing
out
on
the
any
boy
whose
brains
seemed
reluctant
to
admit
examination
facts
those
whose
heads
were
hard
enough
to
resist
the
knocking
found
themselves
completely
absorbed
by
the
mental
gymnastics
which
filled
their
days
the
first
two
years
of
his
life
at
hadley
prep
had
almost
nothing
in
them
for
neale
except
his
struggle
to
make
up
for
the
omissions
of
miss
vanderwater
haphazard
tuition
everything
else
even
the
assuming
of
long
trousers
even
the
summers
in
the
country
were
banished
to
the
fringe
of
consciousness
like
things
seen
out
of
the
corner
of
your
eye
while
you
are
gazing
with
all
your
might
at
something
else
the
life
of
his
personality
his
inner
self
during
those
two
years
realized
the
ideal
of
the
eighteenth
century
educator
who
felt
that
the
only
safe
for
boys
would
be
to
shut
them
up
in
a
barrel
between
the
ages
of
twelve
and
eighteen
and
feed
them
through
the
the
record
of
what
was
fed
through
the
hadley
was
set
down
on
neale
report
cards
which
he
dutifully
brought
home
to
his
parents
they
glanced
up
from
their
absorption
in
each
other
read
and
smiled
over
the
mathematical
accuracy
of
the
hadley
information
about
the
state
of
neale
mind
the
hadley
professor
often
marked
a
boy
as
proficient
in
american
history
or
learned
in
german
at
times
they
wondered
if
hadley
were
the
best
place
for
him
but
they
were
exactly
like
all
other
parents
they
really
had
no
idea
what
else
to
do
with
neale
his
health
continued
good
and
he
did
not
seem
rebellious
so
they
confined
their
supervision
of
his
education
to
paying
his
rather
expensive
tuition
signing
his
report
cards
and
handing
them
back
to
him
towards
the
end
of
the
second
year
neale
began
to
master
the
new
technique
he
memorized
the
magic
which
are
accepted
as
a
proof
of
understanding
many
subjects
he
began
to
draw
breath
to
tread
water
less
frantically
and
still
not
to
fear
the
closing
over
his
head
of
smothering
floods
the
third
year
he
felt
earth
beneath
his
feet
again
and
relaxed
enough
from
his
mental
concentration
to
spend
occasionally
an
hour
or
two
on
the
school
athletic
field
he
was
fifteen
years
old
now
wore
long
trousers
and
suits
with
vests
a
collar
ties
he
tied
himself
and
carried
a
fountain
pen
underneath
all
this
bravery
of
exterior
there
was
a
brain
that
had
learned
to
acquire
and
information
and
a
perfectly
dormant
personality
life
at
the
crittenden
home
was
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
exactly
the
same
life
he
had
always
known
except
that
instead
of
playing
on
the
streets
he
went
out
on
the
school
and
instead
of
playing
with
his
tin
soldiers
he
usually
went
up
to
his
room
to
grind
over
his
lessons
at
breakfast
and
supper
his
father
and
mother
talked
peaceably
to
one
another
just
as
they
always
had
and
although
neale
was
able
now
to
understand
the
subjects
of
their
chat
their
talk
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
often
quite
as
incomprehensible
to
him
as
it
had
been
when
he
was
a
small
boy
they
had
grown
so
much
together
had
so
shared
life
with
each
other
and
no
one
else
that
they
possessed
almost
a
language
of
their
own
made
up
of
references
only
to
things
they
had
said
long
ago
or
to
experiences
they
had
had
together
or
to
opinions
they
both
knew
so
well
there
was
no
need
to
formulate
them
in
words
neale
was
not
surprised
at
this
nor
yet
resentful
on
his
side
he
was
absorbed
in
his
studies
and
the
life
at
school
it
was
true
that
every
once
in
a
while
they
talked
directly
to
neale
asked
him
questions
what
studies
he
liked
best
how
the
teachers
treated
him
what
he
had
to
eat
at
lunch
whatever
they
asked
neale
always
tried
to
answer
in
accordance
with
the
facts
that
he
was
getting
along
all
right
he
guessed
that
everything
was
satisfactory
as
far
as
he
could
see
that
he
had
any
idea
what
he
should
like
to
do
later
on
to
earn
his
living
occasionally
instead
of
taking
the
trolley
cars
father
and
neale
walked
together
down
the
long
steps
to
hoboken
and
along
street
to
hudson
where
his
father
turned
south
and
neale
went
to
the
school
then
talk
was
harder
to
dodge
not
that
neale
ever
consciously
dodged
they
would
walk
a
dozen
blocks
father
would
ask
a
question
neale
would
answer
it
another
dozen
blocks
and
another
question
once
father
asked
if
neale
was
sticking
indoors
too
much
could
he
manage
to
get
a
little
more
exercise
neale
explained
the
seriousness
of
his
studies
and
pointed
out
that
he
still
rode
his
wheel
on
saturdays
but
the
suggestion
took
root
neale
bought
a
pair
of
indian
clubs
and
an
instruction
book
and
took
to
swinging
the
clubs
fifteen
minutes
night
and
morning
with
the
windows
open
another
time
father
said
look
here
neale
have
you
any
friends
neale
was
astonished
why
yes
i
friends
with
the
whole
class
yes
i
suppose
so
but
you
never
seem
to
be
with
them
outside
of
school
when
i
went
to
school
we
were
always
playing
around
in
each
other
yards
and
barns
you
went
to
school
in
the
country
neale
reminded
him
we
have
any
yards
or
barns
here
we
have
the
athletic
field
at
school
yes
that
so
his
father
admitted
after
a
time
he
made
a
further
admission
athletics
are
all
right
too
but
something
in
his
tone
intimated
that
he
was
baffled
rather
than
convinced
since
neale
considered
that
athletics
were
not
only
all
right
but
all
there
was
to
life
he
found
no
comment
to
make
a
moment
later
but
great
scott
began
his
father
with
some
heat
as
though
struck
afresh
with
some
aspect
of
neale
life
he
seemed
to
hear
the
vivacity
of
his
accent
and
to
wait
until
he
could
ask
quite
casually
are
there
any
of
your
you
like
to
have
visit
you
neale
considered
it
had
struck
him
before
but
it
was
a
fact
that
after
school
and
athletic
practice
all
the
boys
vanished
to
their
various
homes
never
having
known
any
other
than
this
city
relation
with
it
seemed
to
him
obvious
and
natural
visit
me
he
said
trying
to
imagine
one
of
his
classmates
sitting
at
the
crittenden
and
then
no
i
do
believe
i
do
there
would
be
anything
special
to
do
at
home
would
there
his
father
drew
on
his
cigar
thoughtfully
and
walked
on
in
silence
but
he
had
a
long
talk
with
neale
mother
that
evening
the
two
country
and
parents
putting
their
heads
together
earnestly
though
helplessly
the
only
course
which
occurred
to
them
was
proposed
to
neale
a
week
later
when
mother
asked
him
if
he
would
do
something
to
please
her
incautiously
neale
said
of
course
yes
he
would
he
was
always
willing
enough
to
please
mother
and
he
had
never
made
the
slightest
objection
to
anything
his
parents
planned
for
him
but
this
plan
turned
out
to
be
something
very
alarming
it
was
all
arranged
mother
told
him
that
he
was
to
go
to
in
the
germania
club
on
tuesday
afternoons
mother
pointed
out
that
now
he
was
fifteen
years
old
and
through
he
ought
to
learn
to
dance
neale
had
no
theoretic
objections
to
offer
and
had
given
his
word
that
he
would
not
object
so
hiding
except
for
his
first
wild
look
of
dismay
the
terror
and
repugnance
which
filled
him
he
wrapped
up
the
newly
bought
oxfords
and
started
there
were
limits
even
to
the
iroquois
stoicism
of
his
acceptance
of
what
fate
brought
him
no
power
on
earth
could
have
made
him
walk
through
the
streets
in
those
shoes
but
mother
never
pushed
him
anywhere
near
one
of
those
limits
she
did
not
even
suggest
that
he
wear
his
dancing
shoes
she
helped
him
find
the
paper
and
string
to
wrap
them
up
also
she
did
not
fuss
over
him
not
much
she
looked
at
him
hard
picked
a
thread
off
the
sleeve
of
the
blue
serge
which
was
his
costume
and
called
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
a
button
of
his
vest
was
unbuttoned
she
did
not
offer
to
button
it
herself
or
handle
him
in
any
way
mother
was
all
right
if
she
did
want
him
to
go
to
so
he
went
and
it
was
not
so
bad
not
nearly
so
bad
as
he
feared
the
reassuring
factor
being
that
everybody
else
there
was
in
the
same
boat
you
could
see
how
they
all
despised
it
except
of
course
the
girls
while
he
was
changing
his
shoes
in
silent
alarm
and
disgust
in
the
who
should
come
in
but
jenkins
a
lower
middle
at
school
neale
did
know
jenkins
except
by
name
but
at
least
he
was
some
one
to
lean
on
neale
was
at
once
very
cordial
and
jenkins
surprised
and
flattered
by
this
attention
from
an
man
promised
to
show
him
how
everything
was
done
they
went
into
the
neale
clinging
morally
for
dear
life
to
jenkins
a
number
of
other
young
men
of
fifteen
and
sixteen
and
girls
who
looked
almost
like
young
ladies
were
sitting
on
opposite
sides
of
the
room
a
man
to
whom
jenkins
referred
as
one
lung
sat
at
the
piano
the
dancing
master
was
young
german
energetic
and
thorough
he
called
the
class
to
their
feet
explained
and
illustrated
the
step
and
made
them
all
practice
it
en
masse
and
and
then
after
a
few
minutes
the
music
struck
up
and
he
left
them
to
choose
partners
and
dance
neale
of
course
did
nothing
of
the
kind
but
pretended
he
find
a
partner
there
were
twice
as
many
girls
as
boys
and
went
back
to
his
seat
this
was
a
tactical
error
the
master
spotted
him
at
once
could
find
a
partner
oh
dance
with
me
then
he
whirled
neale
about
the
room
till
his
soul
sickened
led
him
up
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
sent
him
off
with
a
bony
girl
with
freckles
neale
was
caught
that
way
twice
but
no
more
after
that
he
had
at
least
ordinary
sense
he
told
himself
next
time
the
music
started
he
gulped
down
his
objections
to
the
whole
proceeding
and
bowed
to
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
room
the
course
was
very
thorough
covering
much
that
was
obsolescent
and
a
good
deal
that
was
definitely
dead
in
that
and
succeeding
lessons
neale
received
instruction
in
the
steps
of
the
polka
the
schottische
the
varsovienne
the
he
really
learned
managing
to
yale
down
the
length
of
the
hall
without
stepping
on
his
partner
feet
and
although
he
hated
the
waltz
he
was
forced
by
infinite
repetition
into
mastering
it
oh
the
misery
of
the
with
the
constant
exhortation
do
hop
neale
carried
into
his
dancing
the
same
minute
earnestness
that
won
him
success
at
his
games
and
studies
he
did
not
see
the
use
of
dancing
any
more
than
he
saw
the
use
of
learning
german
but
as
the
jobs
seemed
to
have
to
be
done
he
tackled
both
of
them
conscientiously
he
remembered
to
reverse
in
waltzing
just
as
he
remembered
to
put
the
auxiliary
at
the
end
of
a
sentence
after
als
he
came
to
be
considered
a
good
dancer
the
girls
did
not
claim
to
be
tired
when
he
asked
them
to
dance
with
him
but
he
went
no
further
even
after
he
had
mastered
the
steps
and
leading
he
did
not
talk
as
he
spun
methodically
around
what
was
there
to
say
and
even
when
he
waltzed
with
flossie
winters
the
admitted
belle
his
heart
beat
no
faster
it
was
nothing
to
him
to
put
his
arm
around
her
waist
in
spite
of
his
long
trousers
and
collar
the
spirit
of
the
thing
escaped
him
his
time
had
not
come
after
some
months
they
seemed
very
long
months
to
neale
the
conscientious
and
thorough
instructor
gave
him
a
printed
testimonial
of
efficiency
there
was
no
more
he
could
teach
neale
over
this
his
mother
looked
at
him
would
you
like
to
go
on
for
the
fun
of
it
neale
she
asked
him
rather
urgently
neale
father
took
his
cigar
out
of
his
mouth
to
hear
neale
answer
for
the
of
it
said
neale
stupefied
at
the
idea
his
parents
exchanged
glances
and
shook
their
heads
beaten
oh
of
course
you
do
to
his
mother
assured
him
hastily
his
father
put
his
cigar
back
in
his
mouth
chapter
xii
in
june
when
hadley
prep
unlocked
its
grim
doors
and
spewed
forth
the
neale
for
his
third
vacation
he
did
not
as
he
had
always
done
before
go
at
once
with
mother
to
west
adams
and
the
the
invariable
program
of
his
journey
there
mother
two
weeks
stay
with
him
to
get
him
settled
her
going
on
to
visit
vague
relatives
of
her
own
elsewhere
in
massachusetts
and
her
return
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
summer
with
father
was
upset
by
the
news
from
the
west
adams
crittendens
jenny
the
hired
girl
had
been
to
visit
friends
in
troy
and
had
fallen
ill
on
her
return
the
doctor
thought
it
might
be
typhoid
certainly
they
did
not
want
a
boy
visitor
bothering
around
until
the
matter
was
settled
and
they
knew
whether
they
were
in
for
a
long
siege
the
crittendens
like
all
methodical
people
were
quite
at
a
loss
when
circumstances
interfered
with
their
routine
if
there
was
one
part
of
neale
year
the
rightness
of
which
they
did
not
doubt
it
was
the
summer
spent
in
the
country
where
his
father
had
grown
up
now
they
were
confronted
with
a
perfectly
new
aspect
of
the
problem
of
what
to
do
with
him
they
solved
it
by
not
doing
anything
for
the
present
crittenden
went
off
to
visit
the
usual
relatives
in
massachusetts
delicate
old
ladies
whose
nerves
could
not
hold
out
against
the
idea
of
a
great
ramping
boy
and
neale
was
left
temporarily
with
his
father
to
wait
developments
in
west
adams
the
first
days
of
liberty
were
sweet
enough
after
the
strain
of
examinations
neale
loafed
or
rode
his
wheel
he
had
a
new
frame
bicycle
now
at
random
up
to
hudson
heights
and
beyond
on
the
palisades
but
less
than
a
week
of
this
was
enough
he
tried
to
amuse
himself
with
baseball
again
but
it
was
not
as
he
remembered
it
the
three
years
he
had
been
at
hadley
prep
had
separated
him
from
his
old
friends
they
were
no
longer
to
be
found
some
were
at
work
some
had
moved
away
the
boys
playing
ball
seemed
absurdly
young
the
vacant
lots
themselves
were
absurdly
small
and
rough
how
could
he
have
played
there
he
gave
the
thing
up
and
moped
what
was
there
to
do
he
got
on
his
wheel
again
and
went
out
over
the
plank
road
as
far
as
passaic
swung
left
through
montclair
the
oranges
out
to
elizabeth
and
home
through
newark
home
was
just
as
dull
as
he
had
left
it
neale
was
bored
to
desperation
and
on
a
chance
went
into
the
parlor
and
opened
the
he
was
no
great
reader
in
his
own
room
there
was
a
fair
collection
of
henty
manville
fenn
and
harry
castleman
but
none
of
these
seemed
worth
he
did
suppose
these
books
in
the
library
could
be
worth
anything
but
he
took
down
a
volume
to
see
ours
was
the
marsh
country
down
by
the
river
within
twenty
miles
of
the
sea
my
first
most
vivid
impression
of
the
identity
of
things
seems
to
me
to
have
been
gained
on
a
memorable
raw
afternoon
towards
evening
at
such
a
time
i
found
out
for
certain
that
this
bleak
place
with
nettles
was
the
churchyard
and
that
the
dark
flat
wilderness
beyond
the
churchyard
intersected
with
dykes
and
mounds
and
gates
with
scattered
cattle
feeding
on
it
was
the
marshes
and
that
the
low
leaden
line
beyond
was
the
river
and
that
the
distant
savage
lair
from
which
the
wind
was
rushing
was
the
sea
and
that
the
small
bundle
of
shivers
growing
afraid
of
it
all
and
beginning
to
cry
was
pip
your
noise
cried
a
terrible
voice
as
a
man
started
up
from
among
the
graves
at
the
side
of
the
church
porch
still
you
little
devil
or
i
cut
your
throat
half
an
hour
later
neale
was
still
standing
by
the
the
book
in
his
hand
his
mouth
hanging
open
shivering
in
the
clammy
mist
together
with
pip
and
the
man
with
the
iron
chain
an
hour
later
he
was
tucked
into
the
morris
chair
among
the
cushions
of
which
he
hid
the
book
when
the
dinner
bell
made
him
reluctantly
lay
it
aside
what
made
him
hide
it
an
invincible
sense
of
moral
decency
made
him
hide
it
he
would
have
shuddered
and
cowered
like
a
modest
girl
whose
door
is
opened
inadvertently
by
a
stranger
at
the
very
idea
of
carrying
the
book
to
the
table
and
pouring
out
to
his
father
what
it
made
him
feel
with
a
shy
virginal
delicacy
he
stood
guard
over
the
first
warm
gush
from
the
unexpected
of
emotion
in
his
heart
if
his
father
had
come
into
the
room
had
seen
what
he
was
reading
and
asked
him
how
he
liked
it
he
would
have
answered
briefly
oh
all
right
but
for
the
next
three
days
he
did
nothing
but
live
with
pip
and
feel
intolerable
sympathy
far
deeper
than
anything
he
had
ever
felt
in
his
own
healthy
life
for
the
convict
victim
of
society
on
the
afternoon
of
the
third
day
his
heart
pounding
hard
with
hope
he
was
in
the
in
the
track
of
the
steamer
the
in
which
he
sat
swayed
up
and
down
to
the
ocean
rhythm
of
the
great
deeps
which
bore
him
along
he
peered
forward
there
was
the
steamer
at
last
coming
head
on
he
called
to
provis
to
sit
still
she
was
nearing
us
very
fast
her
shadow
on
us
and
then
oh
the
the
betrayal
the
summons
to
surrender
neale
soul
recoiled
upon
itself
in
a
shudder
of
horrified
revolt
he
recognized
the
traitor
a
white
terror
on
his
face
grinding
his
teeth
neale
leaped
at
his
throat
with
a
roar
the
water
closed
over
their
heads
he
would
never
let
him
go
never
never
down
they
went
to
the
depths
to
the
black
depths
fiercely
locked
in
each
other
arms
neale
smothered
and
strangled
there
and
came
up
into
another
world
the
world
of
books
at
the
table
that
night
his
father
looked
at
him
and
asked
you
not
getting
a
cold
are
you
neale
no
i
guess
not
said
neale
blinking
his
reddened
eyelids
and
eating
with
a
ravenous
appetite
his
large
slice
of
rare
roast
beef
after
that
time
did
not
hang
heavy
on
his
hands
the
days
were
not
long
enough
the
volume
which
stood
next
to
great
expectations
was
called
the
tale
of
two
cities
which
two
cities
neale
wondered
he
opened
it
and
began
to
read
in
a
moment
wrapped
in
a
caped
shod
with
muddy
he
was
plodding
beside
the
dover
mail
his
hand
on
his
the
panting
rider
on
his
blown
horse
the
message
wait
at
dover
for
the
answer
in
capital
letters
recalled
to
life
with
a
long
quivering
breath
neale
slid
back
a
century
and
a
quarter
into
a
world
vibrating
with
sorrow
hope
indignation
hatred
love
he
dipped
his
handkerchief
in
the
muddy
wine
spilled
in
the
street
he
looked
up
not
surprised
to
see
the
squalid
joker
scrawl
blood
on
the
wall
he
climbed
the
filthy
staircase
and
averted
his
eyes
in
horrified
sympathy
from
the
ruin
of
humanity
who
sat
in
the
dark
cobbling
shoes
and
then
brushed
in
with
great
colorful
strokes
the
causes
and
authors
of
the
filthy
stairway
the
squalid
joker
the
ruined
man
the
endless
misery
with
the
four
pouring
out
the
chocolate
of
monseigneur
neale
began
to
burn
like
a
carefully
constructed
alight
at
last
he
had
never
in
his
life
before
given
a
conscious
thought
to
social
injustice
or
the
poor
but
every
instinct
for
fair
play
sound
and
intact
in
his
heart
flared
up
hotly
and
honestly
as
he
gave
himself
naïvely
to
the
spell
of
the
magnetic
exaggeration
and
of
the
story
he
had
had
the
french
revolution
in
his
history
at
hadley
prep
and
could
have
recited
correctly
almost
any
date
in
it
but
quite
literally
he
had
no
idea
until
after
he
had
finished
the
story
that
this
panting
bleeding
weeping
thundering
book
had
any
connection
with
what
he
had
learned
at
school
david
copperfield
was
good
not
so
terribly
exciting
as
the
others
but
solid
food
on
which
neale
aware
for
the
first
time
of
his
hunger
feasted
with
a
deep
content
all
except
the
parts
about
dora
who
made
him
tired
after
this
for
a
change
he
reached
up
to
a
shelf
above
and
took
down
at
random
one
of
the
set
in
green
and
gold
binding
this
was
kidnapped
thereafter
he
read
nothing
but
green
and
gold
till
his
eyes
gave
out
and
his
father
drove
him
out
to
spend
a
whole
afternoon
on
his
wheel
chapter
xiii
although
he
had
gone
reluctantly
once
he
was
out
it
seemed
fine
to
be
on
his
bicycle
again
his
forgotten
body
reacted
with
a
rush
to
exercise
and
fresh
air
generally
he
expected
to
make
at
least
fifty
miles
in
a
but
was
hot
pedaling
easily
through
nutley
he
caught
sight
of
a
young
man
playing
tennis
against
two
girls
and
stopped
in
the
shade
of
a
maple
to
watch
the
game
still
sitting
on
his
wheel
his
right
pedal
locked
over
the
tennis
was
not
so
universal
then
as
now
neale
knew
little
about
the
game
presently
a
chance
stroke
sent
the
ball
into
the
street
out
announced
the
young
man
and
turning
ran
back
to
retrieve
it
as
any
american
would
do
anywhere
in
the
world
when
a
ball
is
in
question
neale
stooped
picked
it
up
and
was
just
going
to
toss
it
back
when
amazement
paralyzed
his
arm
could
this
slim
youth
in
immaculate
flannels
possibly
be
don
roberts
don
the
big
boy
who
had
played
shinny
and
baseball
with
him
whom
he
had
never
seen
but
with
a
dirty
shirt
and
unkempt
hair
the
elegant
youth
cried
out
neale
crittenden
i
be

ushered
neale
up
to
the
net
where
laying
a
patronizing
hand
on
his
friend
shoulder
he
presented
him
ladies
my
old
friend

used
to
be

fair
banging
everything
at
polly
the
essential
rudiments
were
explained
neale
gripped
the
racket
and
the
game
began
at
first
his
partner
politely
kept
her
own
court
but
as
the
completeness
of
his
ineptness
became
awfully
apparent
she
began
covering
more
and
more
territory
running
across
and
snatching
the
ball
from
in
front
of
his
hesitating
racket
in
vain
for
don
continually
placed
his
return
down
her
undefended
alley
the
set
was
soon
over
love
now
crit
said
don
jumping
over
the
net
we
have
sex
against
sex
the
second
set
went
better
now
that
he
was
playing
on
don
side
don
gave
him
a
little
coaching
neale
learned
to
run
in
to
the
net
and
found
volleying
much
simpler
than
playing
ground
strokes
natalie
low
returns
often
went
through
him
and
he
did
nothing
with
her
service
but
not
infrequently
he
managed
to
pat
back
polly
gentle
offerings
when
points
were
needed
don
monopolized
the
court
the
boys
won
a
love
set
don
lit
a
cigarette
and
pretended
to
fan
himself
with
his
racket
how
about
lemonade
for
the
victors
he
cried
but
the
girls
demurred
it
was
five
they
had
to
go
home
and
dress
they
laughed
over
nothing
at
all
shook
hands
with
neale
told
a
few
friendly
lies
about
his
progress
and
walked
off
laughing
over
nothing
at
all
swinging
their
rackets
dear
little
sweethearts

they
commented
don
a
little
insipid
like

nice

neale
blushed
and
accepted
the
magnificent
offer
well
ta
ta
old
man
sorry
you
ca
stay
to
supper
neale
mounted
his
wheel
with
a
very
high
heart
this
was
something
like
something
was
beginning
to
happen
in
his
life
was
don
great
as
he
rode
home
he
decided
that
he
would
ask
his
father
to
let
him
go
to
princeton
don
was
at
princeton
but
he
did
father
read
him
mother
latest
letter
all
about
the
particular
she
was
visiting
in
cambridge
and
after
they
had
commented
on
this
father
looked
at
his
evening
paper
sideways
as
he
ate
and
neale
went
over
in
his
mind
the
events
of
the
afternoon
and
the
wonder
of
don
roberts
turning
out
such
a
splendid
fellow
such
a
good
sport
such
clothes
such
a
way
with
him
neale
thought
about
him
a
great
deal
more
than
about
the
girls
and
with
vastly
more
admiration
he
was
sure
that
david
copperfield
steerforth
was
nothing
to
don
roberts
once
when
he
glanced
up
he
saw
father
looking
at
him
instead
of
his
newspaper
well
neale
he
asked
what
are
you
up
to
these
days
this
was
his
opportunity
neale
knew
it
was
to
introduce
the
subject
of
princeton
but
he
could
not
think
of
any
way
to
do
it
instead
he
said
vaguely
oh
nothing
much
sort
of
hanging
around
and
then
with
a
great
effort
he
brought
out
for
once
a
vital
piece
of
news
learning
to
play
tennis
that
said
father
it
a
great
game
this
seemed
to
be
final
he
looked
back
at
his
newspaper
but
after
a
while
as
though
something
had
occurred
to
him
he
asked
who
teaching
you
where
do
you
play
i
ran
across
don
roberts
over
in
nutley
they
used
to
live
here
on
central
avenue
he
used
to
go
to
number
two
school
he
wanted
to
go
on
and
tell
about
don
being
in
princeton
but
could
not
propel
himself
past
the
where
an
inadvertent
cadence
of
his
voice
had
dropped
him
next
morning
he
found
don
with
a
whitewash
brush
touching
up
the
marking
of
the
court
for
three
hours
they
practised
a
most
exhausting
three
hours
he
thought
he
began
to
make
a
little
progress
he
knew
he
was
almost
all
in
when
noon
came
worn
out
far
more
by
the
mental
strain
of
struggling
his
way
into
a
new
technique
than
by
the
physical
effort
although
that
had
been
enough
to
leave
him
blown
and
panting
as
they
went
into
the
house
to
have
lunch
the
two
boys
were
alone
at
the
table
don
swaggered
a
little
as
he
served
his
guest
no
one
at
home
he
explained
mother
and
the
girls
are
down
at
asbury
the
old
man
does
get
back
from
the
office
till
the
i
can
hear
his
train
whistle
from
here
he
finds
his
loving
son
deep
in
his
books
you
bet
through
luncheon
don
fired
neale
enthusiasm
with
stories
of
big
bill
edwards
arthur
poe
lady
jayne
and
other
heroes
of
his
alma
mater
afterwards
he
strolled
to
the
sat
down
at
the
piano
and
sang
the
orange
and
the
black
there
a
college
we
call
princeton
then
lowering
his
voice
with
many
nods
and
knowing
winks
he
sang
a
long
song
with
the
refrain
keep
your
eye
on
tricky
little
sarah
neale
play
on
the
streets
and
in
vacant
lots
with
perfectly
heterogeneous
and
casual
little
boys
had
given
him
quite
enough
of
a
vocabulary
to
understand
the
words
of
this
song
and
odds
and
ends
of
the
older
boys
talk
overheard
in
the
at
hadley
made
the
spirit
of
it
by
no
means
unfamiliar
but
this
was
the
first
time
that
either
words
or
spirit
had
ever
been
more
than
one
of
the
casual
of
what
put
it
in
the
center
of
his
attention
now
was
his
admiration
of
don
as
the
model
of
colorful
sophisticated
life
evidently
this
was
a
part
of
such
life
neale
applied
his
mind
therefore
to
the
words
and
the
spirit
and
learned
to
hum
the
air
that
evening
father
read
another
uneventful
letter
from
mother
then
they
sat
in
silence
till
as
father
was
filling
his
pipe
he
remarked
as
if
it
had
just
come
into
his
mind
oh
i
thought
you
ought
to
have
a
racket
of
your
own
neale
i
got
one
it
in
the
hall
on
the
neale
bounded
upstairs
and
carried
his
prize
to
his
room
there
was
not
only
a
sears
racket
but
three
wright
and
ditson
balls
tennis
guide
and
a
little
pamphlet
on
how
to
play
lawn
tennis
neale
dropped
into
his
morris
chair
and
devoured
both
books
before
going
to
bed
the
hard
protective
husk
of
his
little
boyhood
was
so
newly
sloughed
off
that
his
adolescence
had
as
yet
received
scarcely
a
mark
upon
its
new
freshness
to
impression
ready
now
responsive
with
an
inward
quiver
to
a
whole
range
of
experience
to
which
he
had
been
blind
and
deaf
before
he
was
catching
up
from
the
chance
materials
about
him
the
stuff
with
which
to
construct
his
new
world
and
here
was
material
ready
to
his
hand
the
editor
an
enthusiast
an
idealist
of
sportsmanship
had
put
a
great
deal
in
his
little
treatise
beside
his
copious
advice
as
to
the
proper
grip
on
the
racket
and
the
laying
out
of
a
court
without
the
slightest
because
he
had
the
of
the
sincere
devotee
he
had
charged
every
section
of
his
treatise
with
the
spirit
of
the
game
the
spirit
of
sport
not
of
border
warfare
so
was
this
message
conveyed
that
even
the
adolescent
soul
did
not
guess
that
it
was
being
preached
to
the
word
honor
was
never
mentioned
yet
neale
understood
perfectly
the
significance
of
what
he
read
under
the
caption
tournaments
the
committee
should
provide
adequate
linesmen
for
while
the
contestants
themselves
can
generally
tell
whether
a
ball
is
good
or
not
yet
close
decisions
occur
in
every
match
and
it
is
obviously
unfair
to
force
a
player
to
penalize
himself
as
he
naturally
would
feel
bound
to
do
by
giving
his
opponent
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
on
all
uncertain
cases
he
nodded
approvingly
over
the
phrase
as
he
naturally
would
feel
bound
to
do
it
did
not
strike
him
as
a
new
idea
but
merely
a
clearer
statement
of
something
he
had
always
felt
was
in
the
air
about
sports
yes
that
was
how
a
college
man
would
act
how
don
would
act
again
among
the
illustrations
he
was
struck
by
a
photograph
of
the
winner
and
shaking
hands
after
the
newport
tournament
neale
looked
long
at
the
expression
of
cordial
congratulation
and
admiration
on
the
loser
face
he
moved
uneasily
in
his
chair
at
the
recollection
of
a
nine
of
disgruntled
urchins
muttering
after
a
defeat
aw
you
bunch
of
stiffs
wait
till
we
get
you
on
our
own
diamond
neale
had
been
one
of
those
who
muttered
one
of
those
so
stung
by
defeat
that
the
idea
of
admiring
the
better
playing
which
had
beaten
them
would
have
been
inconceivable
to
him
neale
knew
himself
well
enough
to
know
the
fierceness
of
his
lust
for
victory
he
knew
it
was
going
to
be
a
job
to
tame
that
lust
to
this
civilized
code
but
he
would
try
morally
on
he
resolved
to
be
worthy
of
don
friendship
when
he
turned
the
last
page
relaxed
the
intense
concentration
with
which
he
had
been
absorbing
the
essence
and
spirit
of
the
book
and
stood
up
to
stretch
and
yawn
before
going
to
bed
he
felt
that
he
had
learned
a
lot
and
he
had
silently
with
the
incalculable
silence
of
natural
processes
an
ideal
had
crystallized
in
his
heart
around
a
standard
of
conduct
and
yet
this
was
all
under
the
surface
as
he
dropped
off
to
sleep
his
mind
retained
as
the
chief
lesson
of
the
book
a
mass
of
stimulating
suggestions
about
rolling
strokes
the
reverse
twist
service
and
the
advice
for
a
solitary
beginner
to
practise
against
a
brick
wall
he
knew
where
such
a
wall
could
be
found
in
a
vacant
lot
on
poplar
street
just
off
summit
avenue
he
often
had
played
there
in
the
old
days
next
morning
he
went
there
after
breakfast
postponing
his
ride
to
nutley
till
after
lunch
the
result
was
so
good
that
thereafter
he
spent
every
morning
there
the
summer
days
went
by
neale
progressed
far
in
his
imitation
of
don
and
don
manner
and
standards
he
learned
after
practising
with
a
box
of
his
own
to
accept
the
cigarettes
don
constantly
offered
him
to
be
like
don
he
learned
to
call
the
girls
by
their
first
names
without
choking
although
he
never
could
bring
himself
to
squeeze
their
hands
or
pat
their
shoulders
or
stroke
their
hair
as
don
did
so
casually
and
he
did
manage
to
pick
up
a
fair
game
of
tennis
when
he
challenged
natalie
to
singles
and
beat
her
don
looked
at
him
with
a
new
expression
and
a
few
days
later
announced
great
news
it
all
arranged

next
saturday

old

entry
fee
a
dollar
that
buy
a
pim
racket
as
a
prize
i
a
new
racket
the
great
day
came
and
neale
flustered
and
tense
was
put
out
in
the
first
round
according
to
schedule
it
did
surprise
him
although
deep
in
his
heart
he
had
had
a
fluttering
hope
but
no
matter
what
happened
to
him
was
of
no
consequence
don
came
through
easily
of
course
after
lunch
neale
sat
with
natalie
and
together
they
gasped
and
clapped
and
cried
played
as
don
captured
his
match
in
the
is
he
splendid
said
natalie
neale
nodded
too
much
moved
to
speak
the
finals
were
called
neale
focussed
himself
on
the
game
blind
to
anything
else
don
was
matched
against
the
peterson
boy
a
lad
from
montclair
don
got
the
first
set
good
the
second
set
unexpectedly
went
to
deuce
what
had
happened
neale
leaned
forward
his
eyes
hot
from
staring
and
tried
to
make
out
the
meaning
of
what
he
saw
peterson
did
hit
the
ball
as
hard
as
don
did
but
his
long
bony
arm
pulled
off
the
most
impossible
of
gets
deuce
vantage
deuce
vantage
don
put
on
more
steam
served
doubles
lost
his
service
peterson
won
his
own
service
and
the
sets
were
even
don
face
was
a
blank
he
walked
to
his
place
hitched
up
his
trousers
pulled
the
brim
of
his
white
felt
low
over
his
eyes
set
his
jaw
and
faced
his
opponent
neale
anxious
eyes
had
not
left
him
for
a
second
the
last
set
was
astounding
paralyzing
to
the
spectators
don
had
gone
to
pieces
and
the
boy
had
pulled
himself
together
his
gawky
graceless
body
and
long
arms
seemed
to
cover
the
whole
court
don
served
with
murderous
force
his
rising
fury
burning
with
a
sensible
heat
all
around
him
as
he
raced
and
plunged
and
stroked
the
ball
peterson
broke
through
his
service
again
don
struck
out
dazzling
drives
but
many
of
them
landed
in
the
net
he
got
by
peterson
with
wily
stroke
after
stroke
only
so
many
of
them
landed
in
the
alleys
peterson
kept
on
steadily
with
his
stiff
mechanical
chopped
returns
his
intent
eyes
gleaming
in
his
impassive
face
he
had
don
neale
heart
was
bursting
don
rushed
to
the
net
peterson
lobbed
to
the
and
it
was
all
over
don
was
beaten
in
a
flash
neale
found
an
excuse
for
his
hero
every
one
has
his
but
though
by
the
look
on
don
face
he
could
not
turn
his
eyes
away
from
the
dashing
figure
in
white
flannels
which
stood
there
frozen
in
as
the
fatal
ball
fell
inside
the
then
with
a
furious
swing
of
his
arm
don
flung
his
racket
from
him
as
if
he
wished
to
break
it
into
a
thousand
pieces
by
good
luck
it
did
not
hit
one
of
the
girl
spectators
but
fell
with
a
little
crash
of
broken
twigs
into
the
midst
of
a
lilac
bush
he
took
a
step
or
two
after
this
as
if
he
meant
to
leave
the
court
at
once
with
an
effort
he
turned
about
walked
up
to
the
net
where
the
peterson
boy
stood
panting
and
gave
him
in
silence
a
limp
then
he
pushed
through
the
spectators
and
went
into
the
house
calling
over
his
shoulder
that
polly
was
to
award
the
prize
neale
did
not
dare
to
look
at
natalie
the
moment
was
too
awful
the
peterson
boy
did
not
stay
to
flaunt
his
triumph
pleading
an
impending
as
an
excuse
the
sky
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
very
black
and
lowering
he
scorched
off
on
his
wheel
back
to
montclair
with
the
spoils
of
victory
bound
to
his
with
his
departure
the
atmosphere
of
gloom
among
don
friends
began
to
lift
when
the
storm
broke
as
it
did
shortly
they
all
hurried
indoors
the
girls
set
about
getting
supper
with
a
great
clatter
of
and
much
screaming
with
each
clap
of
thunder
by
the
time
the
cheese
was
melted
don
reappeared
in
blue
serge
and
negligee
silk
shirt
coming
down
stairs
he
passed
neale
standing
apart
with
his
back
against
the
newel
post
oh
drop
your
grouch
crit
old
man
he
said
forget
it
of
course
nordhoff
a
pretty
rotten
umpire
i
suppose
he
thought
he
give
the
kid
a
chance
but
he
need
have
stung
me
on
the
close
ones
on
this
he
passed
lightly
to
the
where
later
on
being
loudly
called
neale
followed
him
starting
up
from
his
moody
silence
as
though
he
had
forgotten
where
he
was
it
was
his
first
supper
out
with
young
people
the
first
time
he
had
eaten
the
first
time
he
had
seen
anything
prepared
over
a
the
first
time
he
had
encountered
the
traditional
young
people
menu
of
that
date
fruit
cake
made
on
the
spot
all
washed
down
with
it
might
have
been
bread
and
milk
for
all
neale
knew
what
he
saw
was
the
photograph
in
the
tennis
guide
of
davis
shaking
hands
with
whitman
presently
loyalty
flared
up
if
don
fell
short
of
the
standard
perhaps
the
standard
was
wrong
it
would
not
do
even
as
he
thought
of
this
excuse
he
knew
it
would
not
do
he
was
aware
of
a
streak
of
iron
in
his
soul
an
idol
might
sweep
away
the
warmth
and
color
of
life
by
its
fall
let
them
go
then
no
warping
of
standards
could
keep
it
on
its
pedestal
but
the
real
sorrow
in
his
heart
drove
him
to
try
to
find
excuses
for
don
great
scott
it
hard
to
lose
how
could
you
blame
anybody
for
not
coming
up
to
such
a
terribly
high
standard
anybody
on
earth
would
naturally
feel
sore
at
being
beaten
in
such
a
even
as
he
tried
falteringly
thus
to
lower
his
ideal
to
fit
his
affection
he
was
aware
of
something
stern
and
relentless
within
him
the
gallant
face
of
the
defeated
player
in
the
photograph
stood
out
beside
don
startled
angry
resentment
at
a
wound
to
his
vanity
nine
generations
of
puritan
forebears
would
not
let
neale
abandon
his
ideal
because
it
hurt
him
he
passed
into
a
condition
of
acute
amazement
at
the
others
how
could
they
take
it
so
perhaps
they
did
care
or
perhaps
they
felt
themselves
obliged
to
pretend
since
they
were
still
in
house
yes
of
course
he
ought
to
pretend
too
smarting
he
sprang
up
at
a
new
word
of
command
how
about
a
little
don
was
crying
in
his
role
of
master
of
ceremonies
polly
you
to
the
piano
get
the
old
banjo
dick
clear
the
floor
boys
oh
pitch
the
rugs
out
of
the
window
a
little
rain
wo
hurt
for
through
the
open
windows
came
the
steady
voice
of
a
summer
downpour
the
musicians
struck
up
whistling
rufus
couples
were
formed
and
racketed
noisily
to
and
fro
from
the
to
the
and
back
with
much
bumping
and
giggling
at
the
congested
doorway
neale
danced
with
a
girl
whose
name
he
could
not
remember
and
whom
he
exchanged
for
a
similarly
anonymous
girl
when
the
tune
changed
to
the
georgia
he
went
on
thus
setting
his
body
to
do
the
decent
thing
while
his
spirit
lay
prostrate
within
him
they
were
dancing
harder
than
ever
now
racing
from
one
end
of
the
room
to
the
other
the
boys
carrying
the
girls
bodily
off
their
feet
at
some
of
the
turns
the
girls
abandoning
themselves
like
romping
children
to
the
whirlwind
of
the
insistent
rhythm
which
they
marked
by
shouting
out
as
they
danced
oh
la
la
la
la
la
la
there
be
a
time
in
the
town
neale
danced
on
with
the
rest
under
his
grimly
silent
exterior
something
fine
and
high
and
deeply
wounded
cried
out
silently
to
the
others
and
received
no
answer
the
music
ended
with
a
crash
the
exhausted
couples
sank
into
chairs
gasping
and
fanning
each
other
neale
heart
leaped
to
see
up
the
stairs
natalie
sitting
alone
as
if
she
had
not
been
dancing
why
of
course
there
was
natalie
he
had
forgotten
her
she
had
understood
the
tragedy
of
the
afternoon
must
have
gone
home
to
her
was
a
good
sport
with
a
warm
glow
he
hurried
up
to
where
she
sat
and
sank
down
beside
her
his
stifling
sense
of
isolation
gone
she
lifted
the
sweet
mask
of
her
youth
to
him
her
eyes
gleaming
in
the
of
the
stairs
but
at
the
moment
neale
had
forgotten
whether
she
was
a
girl
or
a
boy
she
was
a
good
sport
that
was
what
he
needed
he
started
to
speak
but
a
shout
of
laughter
burst
out
of
the
room
below
them
they
looked
down
in
the
center
of
the
vociferously
amused
circle
of
spectators
don
was
making
fun
of
his
late
adversary
gawky
manners
and
poor
he
had
a
racket
in
his
hand
and
glaring
through
it
with
a
burlesque
of
peterson
intent
gaze
he
was
mimicking
the
strained
awkward
position
at
the
net
neale
fell
back
appalled
and
looked
to
natalie
for
sympathy
and
understanding
natalie
had
also
leaned
forward
and
as
they
turned
towards
each
other
her
face
was
so
close
to
his
that
he
could
see
the
bloom
on
her
cheeks
all
the
pretty
face
was
quivering
with
mirth
is
don
the
man
neale
got
up
stiffly
and
walked
down
the
stairs
without
a
word
nobody
in
the
crowd
of
laughing
boys
and
girls
paid
the
least
attention
to
his
silent
passage
through
them
he
went
out
on
the
porch
the
beating
downpour
of
the
rain
suddenly
loud
in
his
ears
oh
all
the
better
like
getting
soaked
he
found
his
wheel
on
the
mounted
it
without
troubling
to
light
his
lamp
or
turn
up
his
coat
collar
and
delighting
in
the
clammy
discomfort
of
the
streaming
water
pedaled
stolidly
over
the
nine
miles
to
his
home
alone
in
his
room
he
took
off
his
steaming
clothes
rubbed
down
and
got
into
pajamas
and
a
crittenden
he
said
sternly
the
world
is
no
place
for
you
you
a
lone
wolf
a
lone
wolf
chapter
xiv
when
neale
turned
out
his
welsbach
burner
and
rolled
into
bed
he
encountered
a
strange
new
sensation
an
immense
relief
just
to
lay
himself
down
and
to
have
darkness
about
him
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
consciously
very
tired
for
the
first
time
he
knew
the
adult
sensation
of
having
lived
to
the
point
of
weariness
for
the
first
time
he
felt
the
passive
sweetness
of
the
resigned
adult
welcome
of
repose
which
is
perhaps
a
premonition
of
our
ultimate
weariness
and
our
ultimate
welcome
to
death
for
a
moment
neale
lay
there
drowned
in
astonishment
at
this
new
pleasure
then
without
warning
the
thick
cloud
of
a
sleep
dropped
over
him
like
black
velvet
the
next
morning
his
father
passing
on
the
way
to
his
cold
bath
looked
in
and
saw
the
boy
sunk
fathoms
deep
in
sleep
the
bright
new
sunlight
of
the
early
morning
shining
full
on
his
face
heavens
how
can
children
sleep
so
soundly
his
father
stepped
into
the
room
walking
silently
on
bare
feet
and
drew
down
the
shades
the
shadowing
of
the
room
did
not
waken
the
sleeper
he
still
lay
profoundly
at
rest
and
yet
profoundly
alive
one
long
arm
thrown
over
his
head
on
the
pillow
as
he
always
had
slept
when
he
was
a
child
as
he
had
when
he
was
a
child
his
father
was
struck
by
the
phrase
and
looked
again
at
the
tall
rather
gaunt
young
body
flung
on
the
bed
that
was
no
child
who
lay
there
nor
was
that
a
child
face
for
all
the
pure
childlike
curves
of
the
young
lips
firmly
held
together
even
in
this
utter
abandon
to
sleep
the
older
man
stood
by
the
bed
for
a
moment
looking
down
on
his
son
his
own
face
grave
and
observant
he
would
be
a
fellow
neale
with
those
honest
eyes
wide
apart
under
his
good
square
forehead
yes
neale
father
had
always
known
the
extreme
satisfaction
of
being
able
to
respect
his
son
there
was
no
doubt
about
that
but
there
was
something
else
the
something
that
had
always
baffled
him
that
he
had
never
been
able
to
penetrate
the
closed
look
locked
tight
over
what
was
it
locked
tight
over
something
or
nothing
did
neale
have
a
real
personal
life
would
he
ever
have
would
there
ever
be
anything
anybody
who
would
have
the
key
to
unlock
and
set
free
what
was
there
before
it
died
of
its
imprisonment
for
an
instant
the
face
of
neale
father
was
unlocked
as
he
stood
looking
down
on
his
son
then
with
a
long
breath
he
stepped
back
into
the
hallway
silent
on
his
bare
feet
and
went
on
to
shave
and
to
take
his
cold
bath
it
was
after
ten
when
neale
awakened
and
the
day
had
sunk
from
its
first
fresh
hopefulness
into
the
resigned
apathy
of
a
hot
with
the
stale
smell
of
dusty
pavements
the
slow
unimportant
jog
jog
jog
of
the
horse
hauling
the
grocer
and
the
distant
jingling
of
the
bell
neale
came
slowly
to
himself
and
rolled
over
a
very
bad
taste
in
his
mouth
both
physically
and
mentally
he
had
not
noticed
it
at
the
time
but
he
now
thought
scraping
his
coated
tongue
against
his
teeth
that
melted
cheese
and
cake
and
and
were
a
darned
bad
combination
to
be
swallowing
of
an
evening
and
as
for
the
rest
oh
gosh
never
again
he
turned
his
big
strong
feet
out
of
bed
and
sat
sunk
together
for
a
moment
recalling
it
all
and
steeping
his
soul
in
wormwood
once
more
what
the
telephone
rang
he
heard
katie
answer
and
clump
up
the
stairs
to
see
if
he
were
awake
somebody
to
talk
to
you
neale
she
said
seeing
him
sitting
up
neale
father
might
note
he
was
no
longer
a
child
neale
mother
might
keep
her
hands
from
fussing
over
him
but
for
katie
he
would
always
be
the
little
boy
she
had
helped
to
bring
up
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
head
now
and
neale
did
not
mind
answer
he
said
stolidly
it
him
that
always
telephonin
she
explained
he
after
you
to
go
and
play
tennis
you
tell
him
i
ca
go
neale
repeated
katie
retreated
astonished
neale
heard
the
sound
of
her
voice
at
the
telephone
two
flights
below
then
she
shouted
up
neale
he
went
to
the
stairs
and
answered
crossly
what
he
wants
to
know
will
you
be
goin
this
afternoon
shouted
neale
leaning
over
the
banisters
in
a
moment
she
cried
again
he
wants
to
know
will
you
be
morning
no
shouted
neale
again
and
going
into
the
bathroom
locked
the
door
behind
him
when
rather
damp
as
to
hair
he
came
out
silence
and
the
smell
of
frying
bacon
told
him
that
katie
had
left
the
telephone
to
get
his
breakfast
ready
gee
whiz
he
did
want
any
breakfast
not
with
a
taste
like
that
in
his
mouth
to
act
the
part
of
a
lone
wolf
of
sixteen
one
must
read
poetry
he
had
never
read
much
poetry
except
some
of
milton
paradise
lost
for
a
specially
loathed
english
literature
course
at
hadley
but
there
were
plenty
of
poetry
books
in
the
library
at
home
after
some
false
starts
neale
began
to
know
his
way
among
them
concentrating
on
the
slim
volumes
with
pasteboard
covers
and
paper
backs
beneath
the
bludgeonings
of
chance
yes
neale
too
would
hold
up
an
unbowed
bloody
head
without
fear
without
wish
insensate
save
of
a
dull
crushed
ache
in
my
heart
just
to
reach
the
dreaming
and
the
sleep
sitting
alone
in
the
darkened
library
how
neale
soaked
himself
in
this
sort
of
thing
hunting
up
one
page
and
down
another
till
he
found
the
voice
that
spoke
to
him
the
irresponsive
silence
of
the
lands
the
irresponsive
sounding
of
the
sea
breathe
but
one
language
and
one
voice
to
me
aloof
aloof
we
stand
aloof
when
katie
and
and
kind
gossiping
voice
sounded
too
close
he
escaped
out
of
doors
but
not
on
his
bicycle
that
like
his
brought
up
painful
memories
every
evening
he
walked
to
the
boulevard
and
gazed
over
the
hackensack
meadows
till
the
sun
set
no
sweet
thing
left
to
savor
no
sad
thing
left
to
fear
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
a
letter
from
west
adams
arrived
announcing
that
jenny
was
up
and
around
and
the
was
ready
for
neale
the
evening
after
that
neale
was
undressing
in
the
bedroom
as
familiar
to
him
as
his
room
at
union
hill
but
uncontaminated
with
any
of
the
new
troubling
sensations
the
air
of
the
hills
blew
in
at
the
window
neale
felt
that
it
was
a
different
air
he
began
to
feel
a
difference
in
himself
but
fell
asleep
in
the
midst
of
this
perception
the
next
morning
scorning
the
mill
the
the
brook
he
climbed
to
the
highest
where
the
young
white
birches
and
quivering
aspens
skirmishers
of
the
unconquered
forest
were
leading
the
way
in
the
reconquest
of
the
fields
man
had
taken
from
them
here
he
lay
down
and
prepared
to
nurse
his
sorrow
pain
gnaws
at
my
heart
like
a
rat
that
gnaws
in
a
drain
but
what
was
this
what
was
this
as
unexpectedly
as
the
impudent
little
mick
had
sprung
out
of
the
ground
to
carry
off
his
shinny
ball
so
did
a
cheerful
little
imp
of
high
spirits
spring
up
in
his
heart
leaping
and
skipping
to
meet
the
glory
of
the
great
sun
pouring
down
its
mellow
gold
upon
him
through
the
flickering
tricksy
aspen
leaves
he
lay
back
on
the
soft
deep
moss
his
hands
clasped
under
his
head
huge
clouds
floated
piled
up
in
strong
rounded
masses
against
the
summer
sky
miles
off
in
the
valley
he
could
see
the
hoosick
river
winding
its
way
among
the
green
green
hills
he
was
warmed
cool
alive
and
oh
yes
there
was
no
use
in
pretending
otherwise
mighty
well
pleased
to
be
alive
the
neale
when
suddenly
the
glamor
had
faded
from
his
lead
soldiers
had
never
wasted
time
in
pretending
that
it
was
there
he
had
risen
at
once
left
the
little
heap
of
mannequins
to
lie
foolish
in
their
flaking
paint
and
sliding
down
the
banisters
had
gone
out
of
doors
in
a
great
hurry
well
he
wasted
no
time
now
he
looked
with
an
ironic
eye
upon
the
glamorless
lost
illusion
with
the
paint
flaking
off
and
hurriedly
turning
his
back
on
it
all
he
went
metaphorically
out
of
doors
what
had
happened
after
all
he
thought
the
world
of
don
roberts
who
had
turned
out
a
well
he
been
stung
but
why
holler
so
about
it
and
whose
fault
was
it
his
own
for
not
knowing
better
don
had
ever
pretended
to
be
any
less
of
a
than
he
was
it
was
just
that
he
neale
had
been
taken
in
by
a
cheap
flashy
guy
when
any
kid
ought
to
have
had
enough
sense
to
see
through
him
and
those
smart
airs
and
manners
but
anyhow
if
that
was
a
false
scent
it
had
put
him
on
a
true
one
there
was
a
lot
inside
those
slim
pasteboard
covered
books
beside
rats
gnawing
in
drains
and
twilight
and
you
bet
your
life
there
was
neale
had
never
dreamed
what
was
inside
them
poems
that
stood
up
to
a
glorious
day
like
this
and
called
it
brother
poems
of
wanderings
and
scorn
of
prosperity
and
conventions
i
tell
you
that
we
while
you
are
smirking
and
lying
and
shirking
life
duty
of
duties
honest
sincerity
we
are
in
verity
free
free
as
the
word
of
the
sun
to
the
sea
free
neale
voice
quavered
with
another
sort
of
emotion
that
was
the
doctrine
off
with
the
fetters
he
pictured
himself
in
a
blue
flannel
shirt
and
flowing
neckerchief
alone
or
with
some
perfect
comrade
knowing
reality
sneering
at
railway
trains
and
cities
it
was
a
gorgeous
dream
but
of
course
the
first
tuesday
in
september
found
him
back
at
a
desk
at
hadley
with
all
the
grinding
and
polishing
wheels
of
that
educational
mill
at
work
on
the
corners
of
his
individuality
bent
on
turning
out
the
fifty
young
seniors
smooth
and
identical
the
perfection
of
the
hadley
type
and
since
this
was
the
last
year
the
faculty
speeded
up
the
hunt
and
all
the
pack
put
their
noses
to
the
ground
and
ran
their
legs
off
in
pursuit
of
mathematics
and
science
the
pace
was
cruelly
hot
and
it
was
specially
hard
for
neale
because
he
had
yielded
to
the
captain
entreaties
and
had
come
out
for
the
football
team
he
made
left
tackle
with
little
competition
and
through
october
and
november
practised
almost
without
coaching
hadley
permitted
athletics
but
was
too
busy
to
encourage
anything
so
childish
and
played
and
was
beaten
with
painful
regularity
neale
found
himself
dropping
far
below
the
rating
he
had
maintained
in
the
lower
classes
he
began
to
pant
and
strain
as
he
had
the
first
year
it
was
a
gruelling
race
but
temperamentally
he
liked
races
and
his
wind
got
better
as
the
months
went
by
he
cut
out
all
superfluities
no
dancing
no
reading
for
amusement
except
on
sunday
mornings
and
then
only
short
poems
about
vagabondia
and
the
open
road
work
work
work
through
every
waking
hour
by
april
he
had
risen
to
sixth
in
his
class
and
felt
grimly
sure
of
holding
his
stride
to
the
end
on
the
night
of
easter
monday
neale
was
bent
over
his
desk
with
a
green
trying
various
combinations
to
solve
a
problem
in
analytical
geometry
when
his
father
knocked
at
the
door
walked
in
and
sat
down
on
the
bed
this
was
so
remarkable
that
neale
knew
something
was
up
one
of
the
things
that
neale
had
always
taken
for
granted
in
his
was
that
his
room
was
practically
inviolate
when
he
was
in
it
his
father
and
his
mother
respected
his
privacy
in
this
as
in
other
things
with
scrupulous
exactitude
it
was
a
little
corner
of
the
world
which
was
his
where
he
could
come
out
from
his
shell
and
move
about
freely
with
no
fear
of
intruders
spying
on
his
nakedness
the
security
of
this
privacy
had
been
one
of
the
stones
neale
had
found
ready
to
his
hand
when
slowly
rather
later
than
most
boys
he
began
to
build
hence
it
was
now
apparent
to
him
that
father
must
have
something
on
his
chest
he
looked
up
nodded
and
greeted
him
with
hello
dad
hello
neale
said
father
quite
as
casually
do
want
to
interrupt
your
studies
how
late
do
you
expect
to
keep
at
them
sometime
between
eleven
and
twelve
i
guess
his
nibs
gave
us
some
stinkers
and
i
have
touched
the
german
prose
yet
that
would
be
pretty
late
for
me
we
better
take
a
few
minutes
now
the
fact
is
neale
we
must
let
you
slide
along
any
more
without
some
sort
of
an
idea
what
you
are
going
to
do
next
neale
having
no
idea
beyond
that
night
work
said
nothing
the
work
you
doing
this
year
has
given
your
mother
and
me
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
father
went
on
your
marks
are
getting
better
and
better
i
did
think
of
putting
you
through
an
engineering
school
but
i
notice
you
seem
to
do
better
at
the
liberal
subjects
have
you
set
your
heart
on
any
college
in
particular
i
not
sure
i
want
to
go
to
any
college
oh
now
for
a
break
into
the
open
road
and
a
flaming
neckerchief
and
far
lands
crittenden
looked
thoughtful
i
admit
it
a
waste
of
time
for
some
but
i
do
think
it
would
be
for
you
i
understand
your
wish
to
get
to
work
and
begin
to
make
your
own
way
but
it
wiser
not
to
start
with
too
little
preparation
and
there
no
need
for
it
yet
it
no
hardship
for
me
it
a
real
pleasure
for
us
to
be
able
to
help
you
to
an
education
neale
chewed
his
pen
hard
how
hard
it
was
to
have
things
out
with
a
father
when
a
man
takes
it
for
granted
that
if
you
do
want
to
go
to
college
you
must
want
to
be
a
or
sell
shoes
how
are
you
to
make
him
understand
anything
about
freedom
and
the
open
road
and
comradeship
and
vagabondia
distant
countries
and
ships
that
smell
of
tar
and
salt
like
the
wharves
how
could
a
man
in
a
understand
a
man
who
wore
a
derby
hat
and
went
to
his
office
in
the
city
every
day
and
father
was
getting
fat
too
the
was
heavily
rounded
no
all
that
was
in
another
world
there
were
any
words
to
express
any
of
it
to
a
father
so
he
said
nothing
jabbing
his
pen
into
the
blotting
paper
presently
father
went
on
of
course
i
should
like
to
have
you
go
to
my
old
college
williams
but
mother
feels
we
both
feel
that
it
would
be
a
pity
to
break
up
the
family
circle
what
would
you
think
of
columbia
they
say
since
it
has
moved
up
to
morningside
heights
there
is
more
college
life
and
of
course
it
one
of
the
leading
universities
another
pause
so
long
that
neale
felt
bound
to
say
something
oh
i
guess
i
would
like
columbia
as
well
as
any
he
finally
brought
out
father
looked
at
him
several
minutes
then
he
stood
up
we
settle
it
of
course
think
it
over
we
talk
it
over
again
but
of
course
they
never
did
they
never
talked
anything
over
the
subject
was
not
raised
again
nevertheless
it
was
somehow
understood
in
the
family
that
neale
was
going
to
enter
columbia
and
neale
made
no
protest
to
tell
the
truth
as
spring
advanced
and
all
his
classmates
began
talking
over
their
plans
for
next
year
the
uniformity
of
having
a
recognized
respectable
destination
was
not
disagreeable
it
saved
talk
and
useless
talk
about
his
affairs
was
one
of
the
things
neale
detested
till
he
could
be
really
independent
and
do
as
he
liked
without
suffering
the
ignominy
of
having
people
know
about
it
and
talk
him
over
it
might
be
better
just
to
slide
along
the
grooves
provided
get
the
usual
labels
stuck
on
you
it
could
do
you
any
harm
they
soak
off
easy
enough
later
on
chapter
xv
with
june
came
examinations
at
hadley
long
long
experience
and
concentration
on
the
subject
had
taught
hadley
administrators
exactly
how
to
time
their
training
so
that
when
examinations
came
the
boys
would
be
in
the
pink
of
condition
two
weeks
later
they
would
be
stale
horribly
sickeningly
stale
but
nobody
at
hadley
cared
a
continental
what
happened
two
weeks
after
examinations
that
was
no
business
of
theirs
weary
but
still
docilely
answering
the
crack
of
the
questions
the
thoroughly
disciplined
troupe
of
trained
boys
went
through
subject
after
subject
with
the
automatic
rear
and
plunge
of
breaking
paper
hoops
that
was
all
right
those
were
only
the
hadley
examinations
they
expected
to
be
able
to
pass
those
but
now
for
the
college
entrance
examinations
the
apollyon
which
from
afar
their
professors
at
hadley
had
pointed
out
to
them
straddling
over
all
their
roads
belching
out
on
all
who
tried
to
pass
with
much
trepidation
hidden
under
his
usual
decent
impassivity
neale
journeyed
up
to
take
his
first
examinations
at
columbia
he
was
glad
that
the
first
chanced
to
be
in
history
that
was
one
of
his
good
subjects
he
stood
a
better
chance
there
with
a
careful
air
of
carelessness
he
went
up
to
the
proctor
desk
took
one
off
the
pile
of
the
printed
examination
sheets
and
with
it
in
his
hand
not
entirely
steady
he
went
back
to
his
seat
safe
from
observation
there
he
laid
it
before
him
and
his
eyes
leaping
to
know
the
worst
took
in
the
first
three
questions
at
one
glance
holy
smoke
was
this
all
was
it
for
this
he
had
sweat
blood
there
was
an
outline
map
of
the
united
states
with
a
request
to
mark
on
it
the
location
of
such
idiotically
places
as
acadia
pittsburgh
new
orleans
there
was
and
indian
wars
state
causes
immediate
and
there
was
do
you
consider
to
be
the
relation
between
the
missouri
compromise
and
the
civil
war
justify
your
opinion
in
neale
leaned
back
in
his
chair
faint
with
relief
why
he
could
eat
it
up
like
candy
and
he
ate
it
up
like
candy
emerging
from
it
his
head
in
the
air
and
the
world
at
his
feet
this
aspect
caused
him
to
be
chastened
by
a
gang
of
sophomores
who
played
hare
and
hounds
with
him
he
was
the
hare
through
riverside
park
from
to
street
where
his
long
legs
finally
distanced
them
the
other
examinations
were
of
the
same
sort
exactly
the
same
sort
of
a
childish
facility
compared
to
anything
the
hadley
professors
had
described
why
it
came
to
neale
with
a
shock
why
the
hadley
purpose
had
not
been
to
enable
them
to
pass
the
exams
it
had
been
to
use
hadley
boys
to
exalt
the
name
of
hadley
throughout
the
collegiate
world
he
felt
a
deep
resentment
a
burning
bitterness
at
having
been
taken
in
and
by
people
who
had
consciously
intended
to
who
had
known
very
well
what
they
were
about
and
had
taken
advantage
of
his
defenselessness
he
thought
of
those
four
years
of
driving
drudgery
and
causeless
dread
and
hated
hadley
as
the
quintessence
of
cheating
the
idea
that
the
subjects
of
his
study
had
any
value
other
than
as
legal
tender
for
college
entrance
that
he
was
the
better
off
for
his
thorough
acquaintance
with
them
did
not
once
cross
his
mind
in
that
respect
too
he
was
a
product
of
hadley
he
came
away
from
the
last
examination
as
stale
and
worthless
as
an
overworked
colt
the
sophomores
let
him
alone
he
looked
to
them
as
though
he
had
not
been
able
to
pass
a
wide
green
pasture
with
running
brooks
is
the
best
place
for
a
tired
colt
and
it
was
such
a
one
that
neale
now
entered
his
head
hanging
his
big
legs
like
cotton
twine
oh
shucks
what
was
the
use
of
anything
grandfather
and
grandmother
kept
a
crittenden
shut
mouth
about
his
drawn
face
and
sallow
skin
and
at
first
were
careful
to
keep
out
of
the
way
and
let
him
even
more
alone
than
usual
he
fell
into
bed
at
eight
unable
to
keep
his
eyes
open
another
moment
and
lay
as
though
he
were
dead
for
twelve
or
fourteen
hours
every
night
awaking
to
see
the
country
sun
shining
in
on
the
slant
hewed
beams
over
his
head
and
to
hear
the
country
sounds
as
clear
as
crystal
coming
in
through
the
open
window
the
chanting
the
wind
in
the
big
maple
the
bright
brazen
call
of
the
rooster
the
sociable
grunting
of
the
pigs
the
pigs
were
a
great
comfort
to
neale
at
this
time
after
he
had
washed
in
the
brown
in
his
and
had
gone
down
to
the
clean
sunny
kitchen
always
empty
at
this
hour
and
had
eaten
heartily
of
the
fried
potatoes
hash
and
which
he
found
waiting
for
him
in
the
of
the
kitchen
stove
he
sauntered
out
a
doughnut
in
his
hand
to
lean
over
the
and
commune
with
the
pigs
he
stood
there
an
hour
at
a
time
occasionally
scratching
their
backs
as
an
excuse
for
staying
so
long
with
them
but
for
the
most
part
gazing
dreamily
down
lost
in
the
magnificent
sensuality
of
their
joy
in
life
they
had
always
been
fed
an
hour
or
so
earlier
so
there
was
no
excitement
in
their
profound
beatitude
none
of
the
homeric
scramblings
of
neale
was
not
ready
for
that
yet
what
he
needed
what
slowly
floated
him
up
from
the
depths
was
their
rapt
ecstasy
of
repletion
their
voluptuous
pleasure
in
sinking
thoughtfully
into
the
cool
wet
filth
and
the
glow
of
their
peace
as
they
stood
sunning
themselves
visibly
penetrated
to
every
fleshly
cell
of
their
vast
bodies
by
the
most
perfect
accord
with
the
scheme
of
the
universe
as
they
saw
it
neale
gazed
at
them
as
they
lay
sprawled
in
the
mud
or
moved
about
very
slowly
grunting
very
gently
occasionally
turning
upon
the
boy
a
small
wise
philosophic
eye
and
they
did
his
heart
good
like
medicine
when
he
was
ashamed
to
stand
there
any
longer
although
no
one
ever
commented
on
it
and
indeed
no
one
was
there
to
see
it
except
grandmother
and
jenny
busy
in
the
house
he
loitered
along
the
path
which
led
to
the
across
the
the
sound
of
the
water
always
threw
him
into
another
contemplative
pause
here
he
often
lay
down
on
the
and
lay
looking
up
at
the
distant
dark
green
branches
of
the
the
voice
of
the
water
rising
and
falling
so
insistent
that
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
so
unintelligible
that
it
made
him
think
of
nothing
at
all
sliding
breaking
turning
slipping
down
leaping
up
like
an
endlessly
curving
line
drawn
endlessly
before
his
eyes
he
usually
shut
his
eyes
after
a
little
and
not
infrequently
added
an
hour
or
two
of
sleep
to
the
fourteen
he
had
spent
in
his
bed
this
time
sleep
not
black
and
opaque
but
shot
through
with
the
gleaming
pattern
of
the
brook
song
one
morning
when
he
woke
up
while
he
still
lay
in
bed
staring
up
at
the
beams
over
his
head
some
chance
association
of
ideas
made
him
think
of
hadley
and
he
was
astonished
to
find
his
resentment
against
hadley
had
gone
hadley
seemed
very
remote
and
vague
to
him
he
did
not
hate
it
any
more
he
could
scarcely
remember
what
hadley
had
been
like
nor
anything
that
he
had
studied
there
that
day
for
the
first
time
he
went
down
to
the
mill
walking
not
sauntering
his
legs
solid
under
him
again
he
found
grandfather
and
old
si
making
out
very
badly
with
no
boy
to
take
away
the
last
one
had
followed
all
his
predecessors
into
the
mills
at
north
adams
and
as
this
was
no
other
help
was
to
be
had
the
two
old
men
had
to
stop
the
saw
every
few
minutes
till
si
could
run
around
and
catch
up
on
taking
away
it
was
fretful
work
like
trying
to
lace
up
your
shoes
with
one
hand
neale
stood
and
watched
them
for
a
while
then
although
he
had
not
really
meant
to
say
it
he
was
not
sorry
to
hear
his
voice
suggesting
why
do
you
take
me
on
i
have
got
anything
else
to
do
what
say
si
asked
grandfather
laughing
so
at
the
idea
that
neale
was
nettled
and
had
a
picture
of
how
unutterably
lazy
he
had
looked
for
the
last
fortnight
si
spit
into
the
and
shifted
his
quid
wa
i
know
hands
is
scurse
these
days
but
land
have
we
got
down
to
taking
neale
was
used
to
the
yankee
roughness
which
they
meant
for
humor
but
this
touched
him
a
little
closely
did
they
think
he
could
do
any
work
grandfather
puckered
his
old
face
into
a
grin
and
nodded
him
into
the
job
if
so
be
so
then
so
be
it
kin
or
no
kin
i
guess
we
can
afford
to
pay
him
what
we
were
giving
hubbard
so
neale
bought
a
suit
of
overalls
at
the
general
store
and
began
to
work
for
the
first
three
days
he
wished
with
all
his
heart
he
kept
his
mouth
shut
handling
green
beech
for
ten
hours
a
day
was
very
different
from
helping
out
a
at
a
time
besides
his
muscles
and
above
all
his
hands
were
pitifully
soft
after
an
indoor
winter
and
his
fortnight
of
vegetating
it
did
seem
worth
while
to
make
an
ox
of
himself
for
five
cents
an
hour
and
board
the
wage
of
unskilled
labor
in
that
arcadia
but
he
was
ashamed
to
quit
on
a
job
that
was
always
handled
by
boys
of
his
age
nobody
had
asked
him
to
do
it
he
had
offered
himself
pushed
himself
in
it
would
be
too
worthless
to
back
out
but
oh
gee
he
was
tired
when
he
got
through
at
six
and
clumped
heavily
up
the
hill
after
grandfather
and
si
walking
it
seemed
to
him
with
as
stiff
and
aged
a
gait
as
theirs
he
shovelled
supper
up
starved
starved
to
his
toes
and
staggered
to
bed
immediately
afterward
the
first
week
he
lost
five
pounds
thereafter
he
gained
steadily
and
all
solid
muscle
after
a
time
he
mastered
the
basic
axiom
never
lift
a
plank
if
you
can
slide
it
his
hands
stopped
blistering
and
hardened
and
he
grew
muscles
in
various
places
up
and
down
his
back
where
he
had
never
had
any
before
so
that
the
boards
became
singularly
lighter
in
his
hands
and
then
just
when
he
had
mastered
his
job
the
took
a
hand
in
the
game
since
the
spring
rains
there
had
been
nothing
but
the
gentlest
showers
the
had
shrunk
to
a
pool
and
grass
began
to
show
far
down
its
sides
the
water
no
longer
ran
over
the
one
day
about
five
the
mill
stopped
with
a
log
no
water
said
silas
got
to
shut
down
till
the
pond
fills
up
they
sat
down
instantly
hanging
their
empty
hands
over
their
knees
in
an
ecstasy
of
idleness
they
managed
to
finish
that
log
by
supper
time
but
the
drought
held
soon
they
could
saw
only
by
pondfuls
a
couple
of
hours
in
the
early
morning
a
scant
hour
after
lunch
and
somewhat
less
after
supper
in
the
twilight
between
times
si
patched
belts
or
hoed
corn
or
sat
and
smoked
grandfather
pottered
around
the
garden
or
sat
and
smoked
as
he
waited
for
the
pond
to
fill
this
was
delightful
just
enough
work
for
exercise
and
lots
of
blameless
leisure
but
with
so
many
hours
to
read
neale
ran
through
at
an
alarming
rate
the
books
he
had
brought
with
him
even
vanity
fair
did
hold
out
forever
and
with
dobbin
and
amelia
finally
united
neale
was
at
the
end
of
his
literary
resources
boredom
settled
down
heavily
si
reiterated
anecdotes
lost
all
savor
he
had
read
all
the
books
on
the
or
had
given
them
up
as
hopeless
he
felt
bound
by
his
contract
to
be
on
hand
whenever
the
mill
could
be
run
so
that
long
walks
were
out
of
the
question
at
last
as
he
sat
gloomily
killing
time
trying
to
whittle
a
wooden
chain
and
making
a
botch
of
it
he
seemed
to
remember
one
rainy
day
when
he
was
a
little
boy
wandering
into
a
room
with
another
in
it
not
being
a
little
girl
he
had
had
small
interest
in
exploring
the
inside
of
the
house
and
where
that
room
was
he
had
forgotten
but
if
there
had
been
any
books
in
it
they
were
there
still
no
single
decade
ever
made
any
change
in
that
house
it
was
worth
having
a
look
anybody
but
a
crittenden
dealing
with
crittendens
would
have
gone
to
grandfather
or
grandmother
and
asked
where
that
was
but
it
did
not
occur
to
neale
to
do
that
and
if
he
had
thought
of
the
possibility
he
would
never
have
done
it
that
would
have
meant
talk
about
his
wanting
to
read
about
what
books
he
liked
and
why
he
liked
them
all
sorts
of
talk
from
which
neale
shrank
away
as
he
did
from
physical
he
set
off
silently
with
a
casual
air
upon
his
search
looking
first
into
the
darkened
and
going
from
that
to
the
garret
the
attic
over
the
ell
and
the
woodshed
loft
there
were
scattered
books
in
all
these
places
in
the
a
few
big
illustrated
books
with
gold
on
the
bindings
like
the
doré
bible
he
had
so
often
looked
at
and
the
big
pilgrim
progress
that
he
had
opened
only
once
in
the
garret
were
dusty
old
of
past
generations
and
in
the
attic
over
the
ell
piles
of
black
books
with
gold
lettering
which
turned
out
to
be
desolatingly
nothing
but
congressional
records
and
census
reports
but
he
had
not
found
the
little
brown
which
he
dimly
remembered
perhaps
it
was
here
at
all
well
he
try
the
chambers
mostly
vacant
now
which
had
been
so
full
in
the
days
grandfather
liked
to
tell
about
when
he
was
a
little
boy
one
of
fourteen
children
all
growing
up
tumultuously
together
in
this
big
old
house
neale
went
down
the
attic
stairs
and
began
to
open
doors
nothing
doing
everywhere
the
same
sparsely
furnished
room
with
painted
floor
braided
mat
dark
old
bed
and
battered
dresser
and
chairs
their
vacancy
struck
cold
even
on
neale
not
very
impressionable
mind
a
room
that
had
been
lived
in
for
a
long
time
was
the
limit
anyhow
he
thought
but
at
the
other
end
of
the
hall
from
his
own
little
boy
room
he
found
one
like
it
rather
more
cheerful
the
sun
came
in
through
a
dormer
window
as
it
did
in
his
own
room
he
remembered
now
that
this
was
the
room
father
had
always
had
till
he
went
away
to
college
and
after
that
to
new
york
to
live
and
there
sure
enough
was
the
little
of
course
he
must
have
seen
it
lots
of
times
going
by
when
the
door
was
open
now
what
was
in
it
maybe
after
all
nothing
to
his
purpose
probably
this
had
been
used
like
the
shelves
in
the
attic
as
a
place
to
put
volumes
that
nobody
wanted
to
read
mather
invisible
providence
sounded
religious
neale
did
not
even
take
it
out
a
big
old
book
with
the
back
off
proved
when
he
opened
it
to
be
rollin
ancient
history
with
a
true
hadley
horror
for
learning
anything
out
of
hours
he
slammed
it
shut
and
took
down
the
next
one
butler
analogy
seemed
as
though
he
had
heard
of
that
one
he
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
little
and
opened
it
at
random
skimming
the
pages
oh
awful
fierce
than
religious
he
put
it
back
discouraged
and
ran
over
the
titles
on
that
shelf
a
name
struck
his
eye
emerson
was
there
a
poem
by
emerson
at
the
beginning
of
the
children
of
the
zodiac
neale
like
every
one
else
at
that
time
had
read
a
good
deal
of
kipling
although
he
was
vague
as
to
emerson
he
took
down
volume
i
and
opened
to
the
first
page
but
thought
is
always
prior
to
the
fact
all
the
facts
of
history
in
the
mind
as
laws
pretty
rough
sledding
thought
neale
bad
as
butler
he
turned
over
a
page
his
eye
was
struck
by
a
thick
black
along
the
margin
a
passage
that
had
interested
somebody
neale
read
i
have
no
expectation
that
any
man
will
read
history
aright
who
thinks
that
what
was
done
in
a
remote
age
by
men
whose
names
have
resounded
far
has
any
deeper
sense
than
what
he
is
doing
an
idea
knocked
at
neale
head
he
looked
up
from
the
book
to
take
it
in
it
echoed
and
in
his
brain
the
first
idea
about
history
which
had
ever
penetrated
to
fertilize
the
facts
piled
up
by
hadley
gee
there
was
something
that
neale
began
to
walk
around
it
speculatively
wonder
if
that
true
sounds
good
were
there
perhaps
more
passages
marked
he
turned
over
the
pages
again
and
came
on
another
of
the
black
pencil
lines
in
the
margin
when
a
thought
of
plato
becomes
a
thought
to
me
when
a
truth
that
fired
the
soul
of
pindar
fires
mine
time
is
no
more
time
is
no
more
the
grandeur
of
those
four
words
unrolled
a
great
scroll
from
before
neale
eyes
say
who
was
it
who
had
marked
these
places
anyhow
who
was
it
who
before
neale
had
sat
in
this
room
and
had
caught
that
glimpse
of
timeless
infinity
neale
turned
back
to
the
and
found
written
in
a
familiar
handwriting
daniel
crittenden
williams
why
that
was
neale
stared
at
the
name
could
it
be
father
yes
he
had
gone
to
williams
and
although
was
incredibly
long
ago
that
might
have
been
father
class
and
this
was
father
room
he
looked
about
him
astonished
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
it
occurred
to
neale
that
his
father
had
not
always
been
a
father
and
a
successful
conservative
business
man
of
but
that
long
long
ago
he
had
also
been
a
person
the
idea
made
neale
feel
very
shy
and
queer
as
though
through
the
pages
of
this
book
he
were
spying
on
the
privacy
of
that
unsuspecting
person
but
all
the
same
it
was
too
strange
that
should
have
what
else
had
he
marked
intensely
curious
neale
turned
the
pages
over
what
else
had
struck
the
fancy
of
that
young
man
so
many
years
ago
before
he
dreamed
that
he
was
to
be
a
business
man
and
a
father
it
was
like
looking
straight
into
some
one
heart
the
first
time
neale
had
ever
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
there
they
were
those
glimpses
of
what
had
fed
his
father
spirit
neale
read
them
because
they
were
marked
some
he
understood
others
he
only
felt
in
every
work
of
genius
we
recognize
our
own
rejected
thoughts
they
come
back
to
us
with
a
certain
alienated
majesty
there
is
a
time
in
every
man
education
when
he
arrives
at
the
conviction
that
he
must
take
himself
for
better
for
worse
as
his
portion
that
though
the
wide
universe
is
full
of
good
one
kernel
of
nourishing
corn
can
come
to
him
but
through
his
toil
bestowed
on
that
plot
of
ground
which
is
given
to
him
to
till
life
only
avails
not
having
lived
good
enough
for
every
stoic
was
a
stoic
but
in
christendom
where
is
the
christian
every
word
underlined
in
ink
crime
and
punishment
grow
out
of
one
stem
punishment
is
a
fruit
that
unsuspected
ripens
within
the
flower
of
pleasure
which
concealed
it
on
the
margin
the
note
was
true
think
of
e
b
wonder
who
was
thought
neale
but
the
old
man
right
ah
this
is
bully
life
itself
is
a
bubble
and
a
skepticism
and
a
sleep
within
a
sleep
grant
it
and
as
much
more
as
they
will
but
thou
god
darling
heed
thy
private
dream
thou
wilt
not
be
missed
in
the
scorning
and
skepticism
there
are
enough
of
them
why
this
was
not
marked
the
old
man
must
have
been
asleep
at
the
switch
neale
stopped
turning
the
pages
and
jumping
from
one
marked
passage
to
another
he
began
to
read
for
himself
a
deep
vibration
within
answering
the
which
throbbed
up
at
him
out
of
the
page
this
he
said
to
himself
after
a
long
absorbed
silence
this
is
my
meat
there
was
a
good
place
on
top
of
the
of
the
mill
dry
and
safe
one
morning
before
grandfather
and
si
came
down
to
work
neale
climbed
up
to
this
dusted
it
clean
of
the
litter
of
a
century
or
more
and
put
the
three
volumes
there
whenever
the
water
got
low
and
the
mill
shut
down
and
si
went
off
to
oil
the
harness
and
grandfather
to
have
a
visit
with
grandmother
in
the
kitchen
neale
clambered
up
and
clinging
with
one
hand
reached
in
and
took
out
a
volume
any
one
of
the
three
from
there
to
the
top
of
the
highest
outside
in
the
clean
sunlight
the
pungent
smell
of
the
wood
the
purifying
wind
wide
space
about
him
solitude
silence
and
this
deep
strong
voice
purifying
untroubled
speaking
to
him
in
a
language
which
was
his
own
although
he
had
not
known
it
shall
be
the
same
as
chapter

march
flora
allen
found
she
was
not
following
the
words
on
the
page
and
let
the
book
slowly
fall
shut
as
it
lay
there
among
her
and
pots
she
looked
at
it
with
a
listless
distaste
how
sick
she
was
of
reading
instructive
books
she
never
wanted
to
see
another
she
turned
sideways
in
her
chair
with
the
gesture
of
a
person
about
to
stand
up
but
the
motive
power
was
not
enough
and
she
continued
to
sit
one
arm
hanging
over
the
back
of
her
chair
why
get
up
why
do
anything
more
than
anything
else
how
horribly
lonely
she
was
how
horribly
empty
her
room
was
the
emptiness
echoed
in
her
ears
it
was
an
echo
she
often
heard
she
always
heard
it
more
or
less
she
told
herself
that
it
was
like
the
emptiness
of
a
long
stone
corridor
along
which
she
seemed
to
be
always
hurrying
hoping
to
come
to
a
door
that
would
let
her
out
into
life
the
warm
quivering
life
that
other
people
women
in
books
for
instance
seemed
to
have
now
she
was
tired
she
had
almost
worn
herself
out
in
the
long
flight
down
the
empty
that
led
from
birth
to
death
she
began
dreadfully
to
fear
that
she
would
never
find
a
door
wherever
she
thought
she
saw
one
ajar
it
was
slammed
in
her
face
looking
back
how
she
envied
her
earlier
rebellious
unhappy
self
bright
with
the
animation
of
her
naïve
hatred
for
belton
and
america
quivering
with
her
aspiring
cry
of
europe
and
culture
she
had
been
married
almost
sixteen
years
was
it
possible
a
a
filled
with
nothing
a
spent
between
belton
and
bayonne
oh
it
was
fair
she
had
never
had
a
chance
never
and
soon
it
would
be
too
late
for
her
chance
how
hideously
fate
always
discriminated
against
her
she
was
always
thrown
in
the
dreariest
places
with
the
dreariest
people
flat
and
insipid
and
tiresome
other
women
encountered
big
and
moving
things
in
their
lives
knew
adventure
and
excitement
had
something
to
look
forward
to
something
to
look
back
on
but
she
had
nothing
but
stagnation
and
nobody
to
care
she
had
because
they
all
assumed
that
if
sawdust
and
chips
were
good
enough
for
them
that
diet
ought
to
be
good
enough
for
any
one
the
days
that
might
be
so
precious
slid
by
one
like
another
and
there
were
not
so
very
many
days
left
to
her
when
vivid
personal
life
might
be
possible
where
was
she
to
find
it
where
where
she
was
so
of
stagnation
she
was
reduced
to
envying
the
exciting
life
of
the
women
of
the
of
whom
she
was
aware
here
as
never
before
in
her
life
of
whom
everybody
was
conscious
it
was
indeed
precisely
to
avoid
resembling
their
bright
colors
and
gaiety
that
all
the
appallingly
respectable
women
wore
such
dark
clothes
and
heavy
shoes
on
the
street
never
broke
their
solemn
silence
in
a
public
place
and
never
laughed
freely
anywhere
except
safely
behind
walls
the
women
they
were
so
determined
not
to
resemble
seemed
from
a
distance
to
flora
allen
the
only
people
in
france
who
openly
enjoyed
life
as
she
thought
people
in
europe
did
the
only
ones
who
bore
the
slightest
relationship
to
the
vivacious
animated
picture
of
european
existence
as
she
had
imagined
it
in
belton
except
of
course
such
dusty
vulgar
crowds
of
common
people
as
you
saw
at
lourdes
flora
hated
vulgar
people
and
yet
ugh
life
could
be
all
gaiety
and
brightness
for
the
women
of
the
that
evening
last
year
when
she
had
tried
to
lighten
the
deadly
dullness
by
a
little
playful
flirtation
with
fortier
such
as
any
american
would
have
answered
by
banter
she
had
never
forgotten
how
frightened
she
had
been
by
his
instant
misunderstanding
the
horrible
spring
he
had
made
at
her
in
the
dusk
of
the
carriage
his
brutal
hands
on
her
shoulders
his
flabby
old
face
suddenly
inflamed
the
terrifying
weight
of
his
obese
body
against
her
hands
as
she
pushed
him
furiously
away
for
months
afterwards
she
had
been
afraid
to
smile
at
any
man
as
she
said
and
she
read
in
their
eyes
in
all
their
eyes
what
they
would
think
of
her
if
she
but
looked
squarely
and
frankly
at
them
but
was
there
to
be
anything
for
her
between
the
deadly
flat
propriety
of
things
like
those
awful
parties
in
belton
and
sort
of
thing
isabelle
came
into
the
room
now
and
cleaning
cloths
in
hand
she
was
surprised
to
find
her
mistress
still
before
her
at
ten
in
the
morning
to
herself
she
made
the
comment
not
by
any
means
for
the
first
time
well
the
good
god
certainly
never
created
a
lazier
aloud
she
said
respectfully
i
beg
madame
pardon
for
not
knocking
i
thought
the
room
was
empty
do
i
disturb
madame
by
coming
to
clean
madame
got
up
hastily
murmured
a
no
oh
no
and
disappeared
down
the
hall
isabelle
opened
the
windows
fell
on
her
knees
and
set
to
work
with
energy
suppressing
lest
her
mistress
still
be
within
earshot
the
lively
which
came
to
her
lips
as
she
rattled
the
brush
against
the
furniture
and
she
would
be
nineteen
at
her
next
birthday
what
a
lovely
spring
day
how
sweet
the
air
was
jeanne
had
promised
to
let
her
walk
out
beyond
the
next
sunday
afternoon
with
pierre
and
she
had
a
new
pair
of
shoes
real
leather
shoes
to
show
off
there
perhaps
pierre
would
take
her
to
a
confiserie
and
buy
her
some
candied
chestnuts
her
pulse
beat
strong
and
full
the
jigged
merrily
inside
her
head
she
reached
far
under
the
bed
with
her
brush
and
enjoyed
so
heartily
the
elastic
stretch
and
recoil
of
the
muscles
in
her
stout
shoulders
that
she
reached
again
and
again
although
there
was
no
need
for
it
jig
jig
went
the
dance
tune
in
her
head
new
shoes
sunshine
candied
chestnuts
pierre
kisses
her
mistress
detesting
the
sight
of
isabelle
broad
vacuous
face
had
walked
aimlessly
away
anywhere
to
escape
the
slatternly
flap
of
her
heelless
sandals
and
the
knock
of
her
brush
as
she
went
through
the
routine
of
the
morning
cleaning
around
and
around
every
slow
dawn
brought
exactly
the
same
sequence
of
tiresome
insignificant
events
only
stolid
vegetable
natures
like
isabelle
could
endure
it
flora
small
thin
white
hands
fluttered
piteously
out
into
the
air
as
though
trying
physically
to
lay
hold
on
something
else
there
be
something
else
the
tears
stood
for
a
moment
in
her
blue
eyes
not
so
blue
now
as
they
had
been
oh
she
knew
how
they
were
fading
she
went
through
the
corridor
into
the
salon
and
pulling
the
curtains
aside
stepped
into
the
alcove
where
her
writing
desk
stood
but
she
had
no
intention
of
writing
a
letter
to
whom
if
she
wrote
what
she
really
felt
there
was
nobody
to
understand
her
she
did
not
now
as
had
been
her
habit
in
the
first
days
go
to
the
window
and
amuse
an
idle
hour
by
looking
down
on
the
crowd
below
the
the
the
soldiers
the
spanish
peddlers
all
the
foreign
throng
that
had
seemed
to
her
like
a
page
out
of
a
book
not
for
nothing
had
she
lived
four
years
in
bayonne
that
first
simple
candor
of
hers
was
darkly
dyed
with
new
knowledge
she
knew
now
that
people
talked
about
a
woman
still
young
enough
to
be
desirable
who
showed
herself
at
an
open
window
she
knew
they
talked
and
she
knew
what
they
said
that
hearsay
knowledge
had
been
sharpened
by
her
gradual
perception
of
the
way
certain
men
among
the
had
looked
up
at
her
and
it
had
been
driven
deeply
home
one
day
by
one
of
those
men
as
she
leaned
out
her
fair
hair
bright
in
the
sun
a
a
man
with
a
in
his
hand
had
stared
hard
at
her
caught
her
eye
hesitated
and
looked
again
flora
had
not
avoided
his
eye
why
should
she
it
was
early
in
her
life
in
the
town
she
did
not
fear
men
eyes
when
he
saw
this
he
turned
and
mounted
the
stairs
to
ring
at
the
bell
isabelle
had
let
him
in
not
knowing
him
from
any
other
caller
he
stepped
quietly
to
the
salon
where
the
lady
of
the
house
not
dreaming
that
any
one
had
entered
still
stood
before
the
window
when
she
turned
in
answer
to
a
discreet
little
cough
on
his
part
she
had
seen
him
standing
there
hat
in
hand
waiting
with
a
singular
little
smile
on
his
lips
a
smile
she
never
forgot
oh
he
had
been
perfectly
polite
indeed
quite
desolated
at
having
made
a
mistake
and
had
speedily
bowed
himself
out
of
the
place
apologizing
gracefully
to
the
moment
of
but
that
very
day
flora
allen
had
the
swathing
put
back
in
their
original
position
covering
every
inch
of
the
glass
and
when
dusk
fell
she
was
always
the
first
to
think
of
drawing
the
heavy
damask
curtains
over
them
so
that
there
seemed
to
be
no
windows
at
all
in
the
room
that
seemed
to
her
to
express
her
life
no
windows
except
these
opening
on
what
was
physically
sickening
and
coarse
no
doors
save
those
leading
back
and
forth
between
the
deadly
familiarity
of
the
imprisoning
rooms
what
was
it
she
had
not
done
which
other
women
did
to
let
them
into
the
center
of
life
while
she
was
exiled
to
the
outer
fringes
how
was
it
that
while
other
women
arms
seemed
to
close
about
warm
living
substances
hers
grasped
at
shadows
or
did
other
women
only
pretend
to
be
satisfied
for
fear
of
facing
the
emptiness
which
echoed
in
her
ears
more
and
more
loudly
did
they
really
and
honestly
find
the
absorbing
joy
in
their
children
which
was
the
sentimental
tradition
and
if
they
did
how
did
they
manage
it
she
loved
marise
nobody
had
a
nicer
little
girl
nor
a
prettier
but
the
plain
facts
were
that
a
little
girl
and
a
grown
woman
were
very
different
beings
with
very
different
needs
and
interests
there
was
nothing
she
would
not
do
for
marise
she
often
told
herself
if
marise
needed
it
but
marise
apparently
did
not
need
a
single
thing
her
mother
could
do
for
her
any
more
than
any
healthy
little
girl
absorbed
in
her
school
and
play
there
was
no
sense
in
doing
uninteresting
things
for
people
when
they
were
just
as
well
off
without
them
she
often
looked
at
marise
across
the
fresh
and
by
jeanne
competent
hands
and
wondered
with
a
sincere
bewilderment
how
any
one
could
expect
her
to
make
an
occupation
out
of
loving
a
very
busy
little
girl
who
left
the
house
before
her
mother
was
out
of
bed
was
gone
all
day
spent
most
of
her
few
free
hours
with
her
music
teacher
and
in
the
nature
of
things
went
to
bed
just
at
the
beginning
of
the
evening
from
time
to
time
when
they
had
first
come
to
bayonne
she
had
made
various
attempts
to
connect
her
life
with
marise
annoyed
by
the
affection
marise
showed
to
jeanne
and
to
that
singularly
unattractive
mlle
hasparren
breaking
through
the
tyrannical
regularity
of
the
child
life
she
had
carried
her
off
now
for
a
day
on
the
beach
at
guéthary
now
for
a
day
in
the
shops
at
biarritz
once
for
a
at
saint
sauveur
but
she
had
come
home
after
such
attempts
mortally
weary
and
depressed
what
was
the
use
of
trying
to
pretend
that
the
things
which
delighted
and
amused
a
child
were
not
inconceivably
tiresome
to
a
those
endless
hours
while
she
sat
in
the
sun
on
the
sand
which
got
into
her
shoes
and
watched
marise
inanely
prance
in
the
surf
or
dig
for
clams
which
she
did
not
care
to
keep
after
she
had
caught
them
how
could
she
see
anything
but
very
visible
repulsiveness
and
dirt
and
quite
probably
diseases
in
the
lank
stray
dogs
and
cats
which
always
turned
up
when
marise
went
along
a
street
and
which
marise
always
felt
an
inexplicable
and
perverse
desire
to
fondle
and
those
cheap
bazaars
where
marise
loved
to
linger
gazing
with
dazzled
eyes
at
the
trumpery
gimcracks
and
playthings
of
course
as
marise
had
grown
less
childish
walks
had
been
free
of
with
its
inevitable
encounters
with
irascible
old
gentlemen
legs
but
she
had
developed
other
tastes
quite
as
bothersome
flora
pretty
slender
feet
ached
with
fatigue
at
the
recollection
of
the
long
hours
she
had
stood
beside
marise
who
sucking
hard
on
a
stick
and
hooking
her
elbows
over
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
over
the
adour
gazed
endlessly
down
on
dirty
smelly
ships
being
unloaded
by
dirty
smelly
workmen
flora
had
come
to
the
conviction
that
the
european
custom
of
sending
a
servant
around
with
children
was
based
on
a
realistic
recognition
of
facts
it
was
better
for
both
sides
for
she
knew
that
although
she
tried
to
be
patient
marise
felt
her
lack
in
interest
in
chatter
about
whether
the
stone
would
hit
the
tree
time
or
how
long
marise
could
walk
over
flagged
sidewalks
without
once
stepping
on
a
crack
good
heavens
what
difference
did
it
make
it
was
inevitable
that
a
vacant
mind
should
be
naturally
more
nearly
on
the
childish
level
and
yet
once
in
a
while
when
marise
came
into
the
salon
to
kiss
her
mother
flora
arms
caught
her
fast
wistfully
feeling
an
aggrieved
helpless
resentment
at
somehow
being
cheated
out
of
what
seemed
to
mean
so
much
more
to
other
mothers
marise
always
felt
instantly
this
special
mood
in
her
mother
and
always
flashed
up
in
an
ardent
return
straining
her
mother
to
her
in
a
great
silent
hug
it
was
a
good
moment
for
them
both
but
so
quickly
gone
she
looked
now
at
her
watch
and
remembered
an
engagement
at
her
dressmaker
to
try
on
a
new
it
suddenly
made
her
sick
to
think
of
bothering
with
it
what
was
the
use
of
a
new
who
would
see
it
except
horace
who
never
saw
anything
or
perhaps
some
one
like
madame
fortier
or
madame
garnier
who
would
think
it
unbecoming
for
a
married
woman
to
wear
pretty
frilly
things
or
to
think
of
anything
but
how
to
shove
their
husbands
and
sons
and
daughters
ruthlessly
ahead
of
other
women
heavens
above
how
tiresome
they
were
about
their
families
they
never
saw
another
thing
in
the
world
except
scandalous
suppositions
about
other
people
actions
she
discovered
that
she
did
not
feel
at
all
well
not
nearly
well
enough
to
go
to
have
the
dress
tried
on
she
was
always
tired
the
enervating
climate
certainly
did
not
agree
with
her
the
doctor
paid
no
real
attention
to
her
case
and
the
sulphur
baths
at
saint
sauveur
had
done
her
no
good
for
all
they
cost
so
much
how
she
had
hated
the
dreary
little
village
full
of
sick
women
perched
on
the
narrow
ledge
from
which
the
sanitarium
and
the
bathing
establishment
looked
dizzily
down
into
the
frightful
gorge
where
the
gave
of
gavarnie
boiled
among
its
rocks
it
had
given
her
materials
for
many
a
nightmare
that
long
black
cleft
in
the
earth
so
full
of
the
wild
haste
of
the
waters
that
the
ear
was
never
for
an
instant
asleep
or
awake
freed
from
their
plunging
roar
it
had
given
her
nightmare
and
the
sulphur
baths
had
not
helped
her
worn
feeling
of
prostrated
weakness
in
the
least
and
now
she
feared
there
was
something
else
her
heart
was
certainly
not
quite
normal
there
were
times
as
now
she
put
her
fingers
to
her
wrist
when
sitting
perfectly
still
she
felt
her
pulse
drop
almost
to
nothing
a
muffled
listless
beat
like
a
clock
that
is
running
down
running
down
the
chance
phrase
caught
her
attention
was
she
running
down
to
without
once
having
she
started
up
stung
by
the
thought
frightened
angry
a
way
out
into
life
a
way
to
escape
from
the
stagnant
pools
where
fate
always
cast
her
a
way
to
find
some
vibrant
stirring
aim
if
it
were
only
for
an
hour
something
to
care
about
intensely
other
people
did
women
in
books
jeanne
passing
the
door
on
her
way
out
saw
her
mistress
standing
in
the
alcove
and
paused
to
ask
a
question
if
madame
wished
mademoiselle
marise
to
wear
a
white
ribbon
in
her
hair
that
afternoon
because
if
so
a
fresh
one
was
needed
her
old
voice
thrilled
as
she
pronounced
the
child
name
madame
brought
her
thoughts
back
from
their
wanderings
with
an
effort
a
white
ribbon
she
said
vaguely
jeanne
reminded
her
the
annual
competition
for
the
prize
in
music
at
mademoiselle
school
the
young
ladies
are
to
dress
in
white
madame
remembered
oh
yes
yes
yes
a
pause
while
she
seemed
to
begin
to
drift
away
again
and
then
with
a
perception
that
jeanne
still
stood
before
her
waiting
why
yes
of
course
buy
a
white
ribbon
if
she
needs
it
jeanne
took
her
tall
body
off
into
the
hall
and
thence
into
the
street
her
mistress
instantly
gone
from
her
mind
she
had
no
time
or
strength
that
momentous
day
for
anything
beyond
her
passionate
absorption
in
her
dear
girl
ordeal
marise
first
step
into
the
battle
of
life
her
little
marise
almost
a
young
lady
her
fifteenth
birthday
so
near
contending
with
rival
young
ladies
jeanne
ground
her
strong
yellow
teeth
and
prayed
furiously
that
the
other
competitors
might
all
have
cramps
in
their
fingers
that
a
fog
might
come
before
their
eyes
that
they
might
have
blinding
headaches
or
at
least
that
their
petticoats
might
hang
below
their
skirts
and
disgrace
them
as
they
walked
across
on
the
platform
she
went
to
the
best
shop
in
town
for
the
ribbon
the
only
detail
lacking
in
the
spotless
costume
which
had
been
ready
for
days
pressed
by
isabelle
and
pressed
over
again
by
herself
jeanne
had
all
the
possible
shades
brought
down
dead
white
ivory
white
pearl
white
cream
she
took
them
to
the
door
to
see
how
they
looked
in
full
daylight
and
withdrawing
herself
by
a
swoop
of
her
will
power
from
the
clattering
confusion
of
the
street
she
held
up
the
rolls
of
ribbon
one
by
one
imagining
as
though
marise
were
there
before
her
each
one
against
the
gleaming
dark
head
not
the
dead
white
no
that
looked
like
nun
stuff
and
there
was
nothing
of
the
nun
in
marise
thank
god
not
the
pearl
white
that
bluish
tinge
oh
no
that
was
only
fit
for
a
corpse
the
cream
no
the
white
organdie
of
the
dress
would
make
it
look
dirty
the
ivory
yes
the
ivory
she
carried
the
others
back
and
looked
hard
at
the
ivory
on
both
sides
making
a
deft
fold
or
two
with
her
stiff
old
fingers
to
see
how
it
would
tie
into
a
bow
she
held
it
out
at
arm
length
her
on
one
side
she
drew
a
long
breath
having
been
so
absorbed
in
the
ribbon
that
she
had
forgotten
to
breathe
for
some
time
well
give
me
a
mètre
and
a
half
she
said
finally
to
the
clerk
adding
scornfully
if
that
the
best
you
have
embroidered
with
pearls
would
not
have
satisfied
her
as
she
came
out
she
turned
her
head
sideways
to
estimate
the
height
of
the
sun
having
a
low
opinion
of
the
accuracy
of
clocks
and
was
startled
to
find
it
so
late
if
she
were
to
get
across
to
the
river
to
the
holy
ghost
church
to
set
a
candle
burning
before
our
lady
for
marise
success
she
would
need
to
hurry
and
of
late
jeanne
had
found
hurrying
not
so
easy
a
process
as
it
had
been
if
marise
was
older
so
was
she
her
last
birthday
it
was
harder
for
her
to
stretch
her
long
legs
to
the
old
stride
something
happened
to
her
breathing
all
the
blood
seemed
to
go
to
her
head
and
a
blackness
came
before
her
eyes
so
that
once
or
twice
she
had
been
obliged
like
any
weakling
parisian
to
lean
against
a
wall
or
table
till
the
roaring
in
her
ears
stopped
and
the
dull
heavy
fullness
in
her
head
subsided
but
jeanne
despised
people
who
gave
way
to
little
notions
like
that
and
had
no
intention
of
putting
on
any
such
airs
certainly
not
now
when
welfare
was
at
stake
of
course
she
must
make
her
prayer
for
her
darling
success
and
set
a
candle
burning
before
our
lady
the
easy
way
to
do
this
was
to
step
up
the
street
to
the
cathedral
but
jeanne
did
not
care
for
the
cathedral
where
all
the
heretic
tourists
from
biarritz
went
to
stare
and
which
was
as
big
and
bare
as
the
of
a
railway
station
how
could
our
lady
notice
one
little
candle
or
one
old
woman
there
no
jeanne
was
set
on
lighting
her
candle
in
her
own
dark
church
of
the
holy
ghost
where
the
basques
go
on
pilgrimages
to
pray
before
the
holy
flight
into
egypt
our
lady
of
the
had
already
performed
many
miracles
for
good
basques
oh
for
a
miracle
now
she
began
to
pray
as
swiftly
and
violently
as
she
walked
blessed
mother
of
god
be
with
her
this
afternoon
holy
infant
jesus
help
her
blessed
little
saint
theresa
help
my
darling
she
cast
herself
so
vehemently
into
her
supplications
that
she
felt
her
heart
blazing
like
a
torch
she
soared
high
out
of
her
body
she
was
swinging
along
through
space
among
the
clouds
wrestling
with
the
saints
clinging
to
their
knees
dominating
them
by
the
fury
of
her
prayers
no
they
would
not
refuse
her
she
would
not
give
them
an
instant
peace
blessed
cecilia
stand
at
her
side
oh
most
holy
mother
of
god
guide
her
fingers
a
way
out
into
life
how
could
she
find
it
other
people
did
women
in
books
flora
allen
eyes
moving
slowly
about
the
room
fell
on
a
photograph
of
the
south
portal
of
the
bayonne
cathedral
it
was
framed
in
dark
wood
with
a
little
gothic
arch
at
the
top
it
made
her
sick
to
look
at
it
how
much
trouble
she
had
taken
to
get
that
photograph
and
to
find
the
frame
that
would
suit
it
how
eagerly
she
had
hung
it
on
the
wall
and
then
had
turned
round
to
find
it
had
made
no
difference
in
her
life
or
in
any
one
life
she
looked
at
it
now
her
pretty
lips
set
bitterly
what
an
idiot
she
had
been
what
difference
it
have
made
what
had
she
ever
thought
it
could
do
for
her
she
and
the
other
women
of
belton
everlastingly
studying
something
or
other
going
after
culture
with
such
eagerness
bringing
it
home
hanging
it
on
the
wall
and
turning
round
to
find
it
had
changed
nothing
nothing
how
silly
they
were
nobody
over
here
cared
anything
for
culture
or
art
or
sculptures
except
queer
people
with
socialistic
ideas
like
marise
and
they
were
right
not
to
care
what
was
there
in
it
for
any
one
what
could
she
ever
have
thought
there
was
what
earthly
difference
did
the
sculptures
on
the
south
portal
make
to
her
flora
allen
driven
along
through
life
without
getting
out
of
it
a
single
one
of
the
things
women
really
wanted
what
good
did
it
do
any
one
to
go
and
gape
at
the
paintings
in
the
museum
most
of
them
ugly
and
all
of
them
as
dead
as
dead
when
what
you
wanted
was
to
be
alive
to
have
gaiety
and
sparkle
and
cheerfulness
in
your
life
not
to
vegetate
and
mold
like
the
primitive
lower
forms
of
life
around
you
like
isabelle
not
to
dry
and
harden
and
become
a
mere
block
of
wood
like
old
jeanne
there
was
nothing
unreasonable
in
not
wanting
to
shrivel
and
stagnate
it
was
to
want
to
have
an
ardent
life
full
and
deep
that
carried
you
out
of
yourself
but
in
her
life
as
by
a
fatality
there
were
never
any
occasions
for
emotion
for
fresh
living
sensations
nothing
ever
happened
to
her
that
stir
her
to
anything
but
petulance
and
boredom
nothing
nothing
if
anything
seemed
to
promise
to
why
fate
always
cut
it
short
those
wonderful
afternoons
when
sister
ste
lucie
had
taken
her
to
the
convent
to
talk
to
father
elie
from
the
first
of
her
bayonne
life
she
had
felt
it
very
romantic
to
know
real
catholics
who
used
and
believed
in
saints
and
she
had
loved
to
go
round
with
sister
ste
lucie
in
her
long
black
gown
and
frilled
white
coif
just
like
a
picture
out
of
a
book
but
this
was
different
when
the
dark
gaunt
old
had
given
her
one
somber
look
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
her
she
had
felt
her
heart
begin
to
beat
faster
and
as
he
talked
to
her
afterwards
in
the
bare
parlor
of
the
convent
with
the
light
filtering
in
through
the
closed
shutters
he
had
made
her
tremble
with
excitement
as
he
himself
had
trembled
throughout
all
his
thin
powerful
old
body
his
eyes
had
burned
into
her
as
he
talked
his
emaciated
fingers
scorched
brown
by
tropical
suns
shook
as
he
touched
the
crucifix
how
he
had
yearned
over
her
as
he
told
her
that
never
never
would
she
know
what
it
really
was
to
live
till
she
cast
out
her
stubborn
unbelief
and
threw
herself
into
the
living
arms
of
her
true
mother
the
church
of
god
flora
had
not
known
that
she
had
any
belief
in
particular
to
cast
out
she
had
never
thought
anything
special
about
religion
at
all
one
way
or
the
other
she
only
wanted
him
to
go
on
making
her
tremble
and
feel
while
sister
ste
lucie
clasped
her
rosary
beads
and
prayed
silently
the
tears
on
her
cheeks
and
then
the
very
next
day
the
father
superior
of
his
order
had
sent
him
off
to
africa
would
he
ever
come
back
perhaps
she
become
a
catholic
why
not
if
it
moved
you
like
this
just
to
be
in
contact
with
the
church
what
must
it
bring
you
to
be
intimately
of
it
she
remembered
that
in
a
book
sister
ste
lucie
had
given
her
stories
were
told
of
women
who
lost
consciousness
from
sheer
emotion
when
they
felt
the
consecrated
wafer
of
communion
on
their
tongues
others
who
were
caught
up
among
the
saints
for
hours
hearing
heavenly
music
and
when
they
came
to
themselves
the
room
was
all
scented
richly
with
invisible
roses
also
without
a
word
spoken
she
thought
she
had
understood
that
the
marquise
de
charmières
and
all
that
old
aristocratic
set
would
not
be
so
if
she
were
converted
but
as
this
last
idea
slid
into
her
mind
from
behind
something
else
there
came
with
it
as
frighteningly
as
if
she
had
seen
the
walls
of
her
stone
corridor
closing
in
on
her
a
doubt
that
cast
a
stale
sallow
reflection
on
all
her
thoughts
suppose
she
were
really
taken
up
by
the
marquise
and
all
the
old
aristocratic
set
things
be
any
different
might
that
too
be
just
something
else
she
had
gone
out
after
and
brought
home
and
hung
on
the
wall
only
to
find
that
it
changed
nothing
she
turned
away
from
this
idea
cold
and
frightened
at
all
it
implied
that
life
was
not
deep
at
all
anywhere
but
a
shallow
and
that
she
had
sunk
far
enough
down
to
touch
the
bottom
she
heard
now
the
uneven
clattering
jangle
of
the
bell
heard
isabelle
come
out
of
the
and
go
down
the
corridor
her
sandals
dragged
at
the
heel
as
they
always
did
in
the
morning
before
she
put
on
her
street
shoes
that
slatternly
flap
and
drag
of
sandals
made
her
mistress
sick
she
had
spoken
about
them
a
thousand
times
she
had
come
to
have
a
nervous
hatred
of
the
sound
had
actually
flown
into
rages
over
it
stamping
and
shrieking
at
isabelle
as
she
despised
french
housekeepers
for
doing
but
how
much
impression
had
she
made
for
one
morning
perhaps
two
isabelle
laced
up
her
early
morning
and
after
that
she
always
forgot
slid
back
flop
scuff
flop
that
was
the
sort
of
sandals
all
the
chambermaids
in
bayonne
wore
for
the
first
cleaning
of
the
morning
that
was
the
kind
they
always
had
worn
the
american
mistress
might
as
well
make
up
her
mind
to
the
fact
that
that
was
the
kind
they
always
would
wear
there
was
about
this
trivial
matter
of
the
sandals
the
same
nightmare
quality
of
passive
inert
resistance
to
the
idea
of
any
change
which
sagged
smotheringly
down
on
flora
allen
everywhere
she
turned
in
her
french
life
they
called
it
stability
she
and
her
friends
in
belton
had
called
it
a
background
of
tradition
and
yet
she
knew
herself
now
incapable
of
going
back
to
live
in
belton
where
she
would
not
be
able
always
to
depend
on
an
isabelle
where
at
times
she
would
have
to
sweep
her
own
rooms
and
scour
her
own
greasy
pots
herself
it
made
her
sick
to
think
of
living
that
way
again
nobody
to
bring
her
breakfast
in
the
morning
to
get
up
in
a
cold
house
with
all
the
responsibility
for
everything
on
her
shoulders
she
felt
weak
at
the
thought
of
it
isabelle
scuffed
in
the
mail
in
one
rough
strong
red
hand
and
flapped
back
to
her
cleaning
this
time
her
mistress
made
no
comment
on
her
laceless
sandals
what
might
there
be
in
the
mail
nothing
interesting
that
she
knew
beforehand
she
turned
the
letters
over
recognizing
from
their
very
aspect
the
flatness
of
their
contents
a
letter
from
america
oh
yes
only
from
horace
old
cousin
hetty
for
marise
how
she
did
keep
up
that
correspondence
did
she
suppose
for
a
minute
that
any
child
could
go
on
remembering
some
one
she
had
seen
for
four
years
especially
a
child
like
marise
so
and
absorbed
in
her
own
life
caring
really
about
nothing
but
her
music
a
bill
for
marise
school
for
the
last
quarter
to
be
put
with
mail
a
circular
from
that
society
mlle
hasparren
was
always
fussing
over
trying
to
raise
money
to
keep
some
quartet
running
in
bayonne
a
bill
from
the
dressmaker
another
circular
oh
as
bad
as
mlle
hasparren
that
association
with
the
long
name
that
took
care
of
foundling
babies
they
were
always
wanting
money
too
a
notice
from
the
school
another
bill
no
the
announcement
of
the
that
afternoon
heavens
never
again
for
her
once
was
enough
to
sit
silently
all
a
long
afternoon
on
a
teetering
folding
chair
in
the
midst
of
stodgy
dowdy
mothers
whose
boring
eyes
saw
right
through
the
fabric
of
your
dress
to
the
with
which
you
had
replaced
a
missing
petticoat
button
and
who
had
no
more
interest
in
the
music
banged
out
by
the
schoolgirls
than
you
had
except
to
wish
ill
to
every
child
not
their
own
there
was
one
letter
addressed
to
her
in
the
pointed
fine
convent
handwriting
of
soeur
ste
lucie
she
opened
this
with
more
interest
ah
father
elie
was
coming
back
and
wished
to
see
her
afternoon
she
felt
a
little
stir
of
her
pulse
the
first
in
so
long
what
dress
would
she
wear
to
the
convent
her
black
voile
and
the
little
hat
still
thinking
of
this
she
turned
from
the
letters
to
the
printed
matter
there
were
a
couple
of
battered
new
york
newspapers
weary
with
their
long
traveling
and
the
deadly
little
bayonne
paper
with
its
pious
articles
and
its
nasty
hints
at
scandals
she
stood
leaning
against
the
table
looking
down
scornfully
at
it
till
her
eye
caught
a
name
and
her
face
changed
mme
garnier
son
back
from
his
two
year
stay
in
new
york
where
he
had
been
studying
american
business
methods
flora
allen
looked
up
quickly
at
her
pretty
blonde
smiling
reflection
in
the
mirror
turning
her
head
to
get
the
view
which
was
her
favorite
so
he
was
back
was
he
so
he
was
back
his
dear
mama
must
have
decided
that
he
was
now
old
enough
to
protect
himself
from
american
ladies
so
he
was
coming
back
to
perch
on
the
front
edge
of
his
chair
and
look
volumes
out
of
those
great
soft
eyes
of
his
that
were
so
shy
and
yet
could
be
so
expressive
he
was
coming
back
to
be
so
nervous
and
moved
that
his
shaking
fingers
could
not
hold
his
and
yet
so
persistent
that
he
came
week
after
week
whenever
she
was
at
home
to
visitors
so
timid
that
he
had
a
word
to
say
for
himself
but
so
bold
that
he
often
spent
the
entire
evening
romantically
sitting
on
the
bench
across
the
way
staring
up
at
her
windows
he
was
coming
back
after
his
exile
in
america
was
he
and
two
years
older
well
we
would
see
what
we
would
see
and
in
the
meantime
father
elie
could
wait
she
had
a
singular
little
smile
on
her
lips
as
she
turned
from
this
item
to
a
card
from
horace
saying
that
business
would
keep
him
longer
in
bordeaux
than
he
had
thought
and
he
would
not
be
back
till
a
week
from
saturday
she
tossed
this
card
with
the
letters
on
the
table
and
began
to
turn
over
the
books
scattered
on
her
desk
no
the
volume
was
not
there
she
must
have
put
it
back
long
ago
in
the
she
ran
her
finger
along
the
titles
on
a
shelf
near
her
found
it
pulled
it
out
with
it
in
her
hand
she
sank
down
on
the
but
before
she
began
to
read
she
sat
for
a
moment
her
lips
curved
remembering
what
was
in
it
and
remembering
how
more
than
two
years
ago
she
had
looked
up
from
it
to
see
garnier
for
the
first
time
yes
she
opened
the
book
fluttered
the
pages
read
a
little
here
and
there
and
then
as
if
slowly
drawn
by
an
undertow
sank
into
the
book
with
a
long
breath
after
a
time
jeanne
let
herself
in
stood
for
an
instant
in
the
door
despising
her
mistress
and
passed
on
to
marise
room
but
the
heard
nothing
drowned
deep
in
the
book
reading
very
slowly
her
eyes
dwelling
long
on
every
word
i
wakened
thinking
i
heard
my
name
called
slipped
out
of
bed
and
went
to
the
window
the
moon
poured
liquid
silver
upon
the
garden
and
there
in
the
midst
of
it
stood
urbain
slim
and
young
as
a
lady
page
his
soft
eyes
glittering
like
jewels
with
a
bound
he
leaped
up
towards
me
and
found
a
on
the
rough
stones
of
the
old
wall
so
that
he
stood
beside
me
with
only
the
low
between
us
he
took
my
hand
in
his
he
was
trembling
like
a
leaf
he
looked
at
me
imploringly
go
urbain
i
whispered
trying
to
steel
my
heart
against
his
youth
and
ardor
i
am
like
an
old
woman
to
thee
a
mere
child
his
answer
was
to
put
one
trembling
arm
around
my
bare
shoulders
and
gently
lay
his
velvet
cheek
upon
my
breast
i
felt
myself
melting
melting
in
a
delicious
languor
after
all
why
not
where
would
the
dear
boy
find
a
more
devoted
and
delicate
initiation
into
life
think
into
whose
hands
he
might
fall
if
i
repulsed
him
he
raised
his
face
adoringly
to
mine
drew
me
down
to
his
lips
his
young
firm
lips
sweet
as
the
petals
of
a
rose
perfumed
with
youth
i
closed
my
eyes
the
only
break
in
the
intense
immobility
of
the
reader
was
that
occasionally
she
moistened
her
lips
with
her
tongue
and
once
in
a
while
she
drew
a
long
sighing
breath
chapter
xvii
there
said
madame
garnier
scanning
the
from
the
back
up
there
in
the
second
row
there
are
three
seats
we
can
take
two
and
hold
one
and
perhaps
after
danielle
has
played
she
can
come
and
sit
by
us
they
were
in
plenty
of
time
long
before
the
contest
began
so
that
she
gave
herself
the
pleasure
of
walking
slowly
down
the
aisle
stopping
wherever
she
saw
a
familiar
face
to
exchange
greetings
and
to
say
proudly
yes
is
returned
from
america
looking
very
well
is
he
yes
that
the
style
in
america
neither
beard
nor
mustache
but
i
think
after
a
while
he
let
his
mustache
grow
again
i
tell
him
he
looks
like
a
priest
but
she
did
not
think
that
he
looked
in
the
least
like
a
priest
she
thought
him
the
most
beautiful
young
man
in
the
world
and
she
was
so
ecstatically
happy
to
have
him
back
again
after
the
rending
anguish
of
the
two
years
separation
that
she
forgave
him
all
the
anxiety
he
had
caused
them
by
that
foolish
infatuation
of
his
that
was
in
the
past
now
she
hoped
perhaps
he
had
outgrown
his
foolish
idea
as
they
had
hoped
he
might
when
they
had
sent
him
away
he
had
certainly
said
nothing
about
it
in
any
of
his
letters
but
even
if
he
had
forgotten
if
he
but
knew
it
she
was
more
than
ready
to
yield
the
point
to
him
to
yield
anything
that
would
end
his
alienation
from
her
that
would
bring
him
back
to
live
in
bayonne
she
had
grown
old
during
those
two
endless
years
they
had
broken
her
resolution
he
was
too
precious
she
could
deny
him
nothing
if
he
still
wanted
it
why
let
him
his
little
american
girl
as
soon
as
she
was
old
enough
to
marry
she
might
be
made
over
into
a
passable
wife
for
there
was
no
doubt
she
was
pretty
and
fine
with
nice
hands
and
feet
and
she
seemed
gentle
and
quiet
once
get
her
away
from
those
impossible
parents
into
a
decent
home
her
heart
was
rippling
full
with
joy
to
feel
there
beside
her
at
times
it
overflowed
and
she
all
but
opened
her
lips
to
tell
him
she
would
sacrifice
anything
for
him
that
she
would
put
no
obstacle
in
his
way
but
for
the
moment
a
prudent
thought
restrained
her
she
would
wait
and
see
whether
perhaps
had
not
forgotten
that
curious
infatuation
with
a
mere
child
there
was
no
use
putting
the
idea
back
in
his
head
if
his
exile
and
two
years
time
had
blotted
it
out
they
sat
in
a
decorous
silence
waiting
for
the
beginning
of
the
program
madame
garnier
moved
nearer
to
for
the
pleasure
of
feeling
his
arm
a
man
arm
now
inside
a
very
masculine
she
remembered
what
it
had
been
the
rosy
translucent
flesh
of
her
first
baby
then
the
little
thin
white
arm
of
his
long
ailing
boyhood
how
she
had
fought
with
to
keep
him
all
those
years
never
an
instant
relaxation
of
her
care
her
prayers
her
piercing
anxiety
oh
well
it
was
all
over
now
there
he
sat
a
splendid
young
man
still
a
little
delicate
but
sound
and
well
her
reward
had
come
how
goldenly
the
years
stretched
out
before
her
perhaps
it
was
just
as
well
to
have
him
marry
young
to
have
his
wife
come
to
him
intact
in
the
first
bloom
of
her
early
girlhood
he
himself
was
so
unworldly
he
would
never
be
able
to
manage
an
older
woman
a
fleeting
picture
came
to
her
of
a
rosy
baby
face
first
child
the
thought
flooded
over
her
rich
with
pride
and
joy
she
continued
to
gaze
at
a
certain
spot
in
the
curtain
her
face
framed
in
her
heavy
velvet
hat
composed
in
decorous
vacancy
beside
her
also
fixed
his
eyes
on
a
certain
spot
in
the
curtain
and
composed
his
face
to
quiet
but
he
was
afraid
of
the
silence
he
wished
his
mother
had
gone
on
chatting
or
that
they
had
sat
down
near
acquaintances
with
whom
he
would
have
been
forced
to
talk
then
he
would
not
have
been
so
conscious
of
the
dryness
of
his
mouth
of
the
roaring
of
his
pulse
in
his
ears
he
stared
hard
at
the
curtain
trying
to
interest
his
eyes
in
the
design
of
the
tapestry
but
they
could
see
nothing
but
what
they
had
seen
for
two
years
liquid
dark
eyes
looking
straight
into
his
heart
his
poor
heart
that
he
could
not
hide
from
them
dark
eyes
that
seemed
to
be
looking
wistfully
for
something
they
did
not
find
something
that
he
knew
he
could
give
something
that
he
longed
to
give
with
such
an
abandon
of
desire
that
he
felt
now
as
so
many
times
before
the
sweat
start
out
on
his
forehead
he
shifted
his
position
folded
his
arms
looked
away
from
the
curtain
and
down
at
the
floor
come
come
this
was
becoming
nothing
more
than
a
fixed
idea
a
mania
it
was
idiocy
to
let
it
master
him
so
good
god
what
had
she
been
but
a
little
girl
what
was
she
now
but
a
little
girl
a
girl
of
fifteen
was
no
more
than
a
child
his
heart
sprang
up
at
him
with
a
tiger
leap
only
three
more
years
to
wait
perhaps
only
two
more
he
frowned
cleared
his
throat
and
taking
his
handkerchief
out
of
his
pocket
passed
it
across
his
lips
and
then
she
might
be
totally
changed
by
this
time
girls
often
did
change
suppose
she
had
grown
very
stout
or
were
gawkily
thin
like
his
sister
danielle
or
bold
and
forward
or
dull
he
rolled
himself
in
the
of
all
the
possible
changes
for
the
worse
and
felt
his
passion
burn
hotter
well
he
would
see
in
a
few
moments
he
would
see
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
must
soon
begin
said
his
mother
anxiously
leaning
towards
him
evidently
fearing
that
the
delay
might
bore
him
he
smiled
at
her
reassuringly
and
put
his
watch
back
dear
maman
how
she
did
spoil
him
how
he
had
missed
her
missed
his
home
those
two
years
in
america
he
thought
of
the
on
street
with
a
qualm
how
good
it
was
to
get
back
to
a
real
home
but
there
were
fine
things
in
america
too
even
if
they
did
not
know
how
to
create
real
homes
even
if
the
men
did
not
know
how
to
love
their
mothers
or
cherish
their
wives
he
had
learned
a
great
deal
there
a
great
deal
even
beyond
the
revelation
of
new
business
methods
what
he
had
learned
commercially
was
enormous
he
faced
his
future
here
in
france
sure
of
success
but
he
had
taken
in
other
things
too
he
was
thankful
that
he
had
been
to
marise
native
country
and
had
learned
something
about
the
attitude
towards
women
there
not
that
he
would
ever
ever
treat
marise
as
american
wives
were
treated
with
that
cowboy
lack
of
ceremony
nor
would
he
ever
neglect
her
leave
her
out
of
his
life
as
american
husbands
did
he
would
know
how
to
combine
the
american
honesty
and
sincerity
with
what
no
american
ever
felt
or
showed
with
what
no
american
woman
ever
experienced
tenderness
cherishing
tenderness
he
would
be
tender
for
marise
as
no
other
human
being
could
be
he
would
find
the
most
exquisite
ways
to
surround
her
with
tenderness
to
protect
that
sweet
mouth
of
hers
from
bitterness
or
sorrow
or
knowledge
of
the
world
evil
he
looked
down
steadily
at
the
floor
a
knot
in
his
throat
his
heart
aching
and
swallowed
hard
three
wooden
thumps
sounded
from
the
platform
and
the
curtain
drew
itself
aside
showing
the
stage
decorated
with
a
stand
two
potted
palms
an
armchair
and
a
sprawling
black
grand
piano
with
two
chairs
before
it
from
the
wings
trudged
in
a
young
girl
with
a
large
bust
and
brawny
rough
arms
hanging
down
over
her
starched
white
dress
behind
her
trotted
a
short
withered
elderly
woman
a
black
silk
waist
crossed
over
her
flat
chest
her
scanty
gray
hair
smoothed
down
in
thin
bandeaux
over
her
ears
they
sat
down
before
the
piano
opened
the
music
carried
by
the
older
woman
waited
till
she
had
adjusted
drooping
on
her
high
thin
nose
and
had
peeringly
found
her
place
then
the
young
girl
began
to
pound
out
the
raindrop
prelude
while
the
other
turned
over
the
pages
the
audience
preserved
a
respectful
silence
bestowing
a
minute
attention
on
the
hang
of
the
player
skirt
the
fit
of
her
bodice
the
crimped
waves
of
her
light
brown
hair
her
hands
and
the
bulging
shoes
which
she
pressed
nervously
up
and
down
on
the
pedals
something
seemed
to
break
and
clear
away
in
head
like
fumes
drifting
away
from
a
shattered
retort
so
this
was
a
this
solid
unformed
lump
of
human
flesh
neither
child
nor
woman
who
had
lost
a
child
poetry
and
had
not
yet
come
to
woman
seductiveness
he
looked
coolly
at
the
girl
his
mother
whispered
her
name
the
younger
sister
of
a
lycée
friend
of
his
dissecting
her
with
his
eyes
immeasurably
relieved
was
it
for
an
amorphous
creature
like
this
too
old
to
kiss
on
the
cheek
too
young
to
kiss
on
the
mouth
that
he
had
suffered
why
it
was
nothing
a
mere
morbid
whim
of
his
ignorant
boyhood
how
right
maman
had
been
in
making
papa
send
him
away
from
it
he
had
grown
to
be
a
man
without
realizing
it
a
man
of
the
world
in
no
danger
of
losing
his
head
over
chits
the
prelude
was
finished
the
player
got
to
her
feet
and
bowed
to
the
muted
thuddings
of
gloved
palms
on
gloved
palms
which
greeted
the
cessation
of
her
activities
she
got
herself
off
the
stage
walking
heavily
in
her
slippers
who
sat
at
one
side
could
see
a
little
behind
the
scenes
and
observed
that
as
soon
as
she
thought
she
was
out
of
sight
of
the
audience
she
gave
way
to
childish
relief
that
the
ordeal
was
over
and
skipped
forward
running
he
suppressed
a
supercilious
smile
of
æsthetic
scorn
her
body
as
large
and
heavy
as
a
woman
no
longer
expressed
the
impulses
of
the
child
she
still
was
she
skipped
clumsily
with
an
inelastic
energy
of
gesture
like
a
cow
capering
in
a
pasture
felt
the
keenest
pleasure
in
his
ruthless
perception
of
her
lack
of
grace
this
was
emancipation
she
plays
very
nicely
murmured
his
mother
on
the
general
chance
that
some
member
of
her
family
might
be
sitting
within
earshot
yes
very
agreeably
he
concurred
neither
of
them
had
heard
a
note
of
the
music
they
continued
to
sit
in
decorous
silence
looking
with
vacant
faces
straight
before
them
till
the
next
performer
appeared
this
was
elise
fortier
whom
they
were
both
prepared
to
detest
because
of
her
father
and
mother
and
brother
they
did
detest
her
everything
about
her
from
her
thin
dry
hair
frizzed
out
to
imitate
abundance
to
her
shifty
eyes
exactly
like
her
mother
from
her
stooping
shoulders
to
her
long
bony
hands
which
clattered
out
loudly
the
schubert
marche
militaire
when
she
had
finished
really
quite
a
talent
observed
mme
garnier
taking
pains
to
be
audible
and
remarkable
for
her
age
agreed
he
was
relaxing
morally
in
an
inexpressible
ease
at
finding
his
head
clear
his
heart
at
rest
to
own
yourself
to
look
at
life
from
behind
a
stout
wall
of
critical
cynicism
it
was
to
be
in
safety
at
last
he
barely
glanced
at
the
next
player
a
nondescript
precocious
child
who
murdered
a
moment
musical
her
short
thin
legs
dangling
from
the
stool
and
the
next
the
one
who
played
the
liebestraum
a
tall
young
lady
with
the
graces
and
manners
of
an
opera
singer
on
the
concert
platform
he
looked
at
his
watch
again
and
wondered
how
long
it
would
be
before
the
stupid
school
performance
would
be
over
and
he
could
get
away
for
an
apéritif
at
the
café
du
grand
bouleau
on
the
place
and
an
evening
with
he
saw
that
another
player
was
coming
forward
a
slim
tall
girl
with
thick
shining
dark
hair
held
back
by
a
white
ribbon
like
the
others
she
stood
for
an
instant
to
bow
to
the
audience
before
sitting
down
at
the
piano
and
he
could
look
up
full
into
her
unconscious
face
gazing
out
over
his
head
impersonally
with
shy
liquid
dark
eyes
she
was
breathing
a
little
rapidly
her
young
breast
rising
and
falling
under
the
filmy
white
of
her
dress
a
timid
propitiatory
smile
curved
her
sensitive
mouth
and
arched
her
long
eyebrows
not
a
muscle
of
face
changed
every
line
of
his
careless
confident
attitude
froze
taut
as
it
was
and
underneath
this
motionless
exterior
he
felt
his
heart
hotly
joyfully
weeping
in
a
passion
of
thanksgiving
like
a
frightened
lost
child
who
has
come
into
the
right
way
he
lost
all
sense
of
connection
with
his
body
and
yearning
worshipping
clamoring
imperiously
calling
humbly
beseeching
he
gazed
out
from
the
bars
of
his
immobile
external
self
at
the
girl
sitting
before
the
piano
two
years
two
long
years
of
exile
how
could
life
ever
make
up
to
him
for
those
two
lost
years
how
he
had
starved
his
famished
eyes
fed
ravenously
on
what
they
saw
the
supple
elastic
slimness
of
the
young
body
the
fine
thin
ankle
and
shapely
foot
the
creamy
forearm
the
agile
strong
white
fingers
so
bravely
flinging
out
harmonies
beyond
the
comprehension
of
the
smooth
broad
brow
inviolate
intact
innocent
ignorant
which
bent
its
full
curve
over
the
keys
looked
and
looked
prostrating
himself
in
awe
before
the
revelation
of
divine
stainless
youth
never
till
that
moment
he
told
himself
had
he
understood
the
meaning
of
the
holy
word
virgin
and
he
had
thought
those
two
long
years
that
he
had
always
held
her
before
his
eyes
he
had
remembered
nothing
nothing
of
what
she
was
yet
how
could
he
have
divined
what
she
was
becoming
that
mouth
her
pure
girl
mouth
cleanly
drawn
in
scarlet
against
the
flesh
perfumed
with
youth
would
he
would
he
know
the
first
cool
touch
of
those
young
lips
he
found
that
he
could
see
her
no
more
for
a
mist
before
his
eyes
and
yet
he
continued
to
strain
his
eyes
through
the
mist
towards
where
she
sat
some
one
touched
him
on
the
arm
it
was
maman
maman
who
looked
at
him
in
tender
sympathy
as
their
glance
met
she
smiled
at
him
and
nodded
her
head
once
reassuringly
she
looked
as
she
had
when
he
was
a
little
boy
and
she
had
yielded
at
last
to
some
desperately
held
whim
of
his
dearest
maman
it
was
a
promise
she
gave
him
silently
a
promise
to
help
him
towards
his
happiness
she
too
had
succumbed
to
marise
who
would
not
he
pressed
her
hand
gently
and
smiled
in
return
a
calm
peace
came
upon
him
madame
garnier
knew
very
well
beforehand
when
the
little
american
girl
was
to
come
on
the
program
and
after
that
yvonne
bredier
had
wriggled
and
grinned
her
way
off
the
stage
she
felt
an
anxious
nervous
expectation
had
no
idea
what
was
coming
she
could
feel
that
although
she
dared
not
change
her
position
to
look
at
him
she
was
acutely
aware
of
the
relaxed
careless
pose
of
his
body
and
of
the
nonchalant
turn
of
his
head
as
he
glanced
at
the
girl
who
now
came
forward
on
the
stage
and
then
she
felt
with
that
sixth
sense
of
her
passion
for
that
he
had
been
struck
had
been
pierced
as
though
a
knife
had
thrust
him
through
and
through
although
he
had
not
moved
because
he
had
not
moved
had
not
changed
a
line
of
his
careless
attitude
she
divined
that
he
had
been
stricken
into
immobility
what
was
it
was
it
the
shock
of
disillusion
of
disappointment
at
prosaic
reality
after
a
long
romantic
dream
or
did
he
still
find
in
the
girl
whatever
strange
sorcery
had
so
bewitched
his
boyish
fancy
she
herself
sat
as
stiffly
motionless
as
he
suffering
so
exquisite
a
torture
of
suspense
that
she
dared
not
bring
herself
to
end
it
by
a
look
at
his
face
some
one
back
of
her
coughed
and
the
sound
broke
the
spell
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
resolutely
turned
her
head
towards
her
son
oh
my
oh
my
little
boy
is
it
so
you
feel
oh
my
darling
do
you
want
her
do
you
want
anything
in
the
world
like
that
my
little
boy
a
man
to
think
that
it
is
my
little
boy
thus
burning
with
a
man
desire
oh
yes
you
shall
have
her
what
is
your
mother
for
but
to
help
you
have
what
you
want
oh
poor
boy
poor
boy
to
look
at
any
woman
so
oh
if
you
knew
women
how
they
only
live
to
fool
men
no
woman
on
earth
is
worth
she
saw
now
that
his
flaming
young
eyes
were
veiled
with
tears
she
touched
his
arm
she
smiled
at
him
closer
to
him
than
since
his
early
childhood
and
he
took
her
hand
he
smiled
back
he
looked
at
her
as
he
had
not
once
since
his
infatuation
began
like
her
son
her
only
son
once
more
letting
her
into
his
heart
she
held
tightly
to
his
hand
now
happy
and
at
peace
thus
together
hand
in
hand
they
were
looking
up
at
the
stage
when
the
girl
struck
the
final
chord
and
rising
turned
once
more
towards
the
front
to
make
her
bow
in
acknowledgment
of
the
applause
the
excitement
the
effort
had
brought
a
color
into
her
subtly
modeled
cheeks
once
more
she
looked
out
into
the
audience
impersonally
and
then
as
she
turned
to
go
unconsciously
drawn
by
the
intense
gaze
of
the
couple
in
the
second
row
her
dark
eyes
dropped
to
them
for
an
instant
glance
of
friendly
recognition
madame
garnier
felt
her
son
draw
a
sudden
gasping
breath
through
lips
and
tighten
his
hold
on
her
hand
during
the
rest
of
the
program
her
thoughts
and
plans
rose
in
a
busy
circling
swarm
after
all
there
were
advantages
it
might
be
much
worse
impressionable
sensitive
inexperienced
as
was
it
might
very
well
have
been
some
mature
married
woman
in
search
of
a
new
sensation
who
had
thus
caught
his
first
young
passion
or
even
not
his
passion
at
all
even
if
he
himself
had
felt
nothing
any
woman
could
have
victimized
him
by
working
on
that
foolish
sensibility
of
his
if
she
could
make
him
think
and
his
mother
always
had
a
scared
sense
of
how
easy
that
would
be
that
she
was
in
love
with
him
he
would
never
know
how
to
retreat
as
more
brutal
men
knew
so
well
how
to
do
she
had
always
been
afraid
of
some
such
entanglement
as
that
in
which
weakness
in
her
heart
she
called
it
plainly
that
and
not
chivalry
or
sensibility
would
make
him
a
helpless
victim
of
a
woman
either
an
old
fool
herself
or
a
calculating
sensualist
heavens
how
many
dangers
there
were
in
the
world
for
one
son
and
sons
could
not
be
guarded
like
daughters
by
keeping
them
under
your
thumb
there
were
also
for
such
a
romantic
unworldly
boy
as
all
the
variations
on
the
camille
theme
how
easily
some
shrewd
woman
of
the
could
have
pulled
the
wool
over
his
eyes
madame
garnier
had
no
doubts
that
knew
such
women
her
son
was
a
man
like
all
other
men
for
all
his
poetic
ideas
and
had
certainly
had
his
part
of
an
ordinary
man
life
especially
those
last
two
years
away
from
home
irresponsible
and
alone
oh
yes
the
more
she
thought
shudderingly
of
the
dangers
he
had
escaped
the
more
harmless
appeared
this
fancy
for
a
school
girl
and
if
his
fancy
was
to
light
on
a
young
girl
in
some
ways
it
was
more
convenient
to
have
her
a
foreigner
with
no
family
so
to
speak
rather
than
a
girl
of
bayonne
society
whose
family
would
expect
to
have
much
to
say
about
all
the
arrangements
of
life
heavens
suppose
it
had
been
elise
fortier
think
of
saddled
with
madame
fortier
as
a
not
that
that
worthless
idle
american
was
much
better
except
that
those
people
go
back
to
america
some
time
everybody
did
go
back
to
his
native
country
ultimately
and
too
she
was
a
weak
foolish
thing
who
would
never
have
the
force
to
make
trouble
look
at
the
way
she
let
herself
be
run
by
her
servants
also
until
now
she
had
paid
precious
little
attention
to
her
daughter
there
was
no
reason
to
think
she
would
develop
any
more
interest
in
her
later
on
and
the
child
herself
seemed
malleable
material
there
was
no
doubt
she
would
be
a
pretty
woman
and
marrying
very
young
she
would
certainly
assimilate
the
standards
of
the
garnier
family
when
the
concert
was
over
she
said
to
if
you
like
we
will
wait
till
the
girls
come
out
and
walk
home
with
danielle
and
her
classmates
as
she
spoke
she
nodded
to
old
jeanne
amigorena
the
cook
in
the
american
family
who
stood
there
also
waiting
her
young
mistress
cloak
and
hat
on
her
arm
it
occurred
to
her
that
one
of
the
first
things
to
do
would
be
to
eliminate
that
servant
she
probably
knew
altogether
too
much
about
marise
family
it
would
not
be
prudent
to
have
her
around
a
young
ménage
and
anyhow
old
servants
were
an
intolerable
nuisance
with
their
airs
of
belonging
to
the
family
behind
the
scenes
where
the
girls
were
waiting
for
the
concert
to
begin
there
had
been
a
deal
of
giggling
and
whispering
and
rustling
mademoiselle
vivier
chosen
to
turn
the
pages
for
the
players
because
she
was
so
severe
it
was
thought
she
could
keep
them
in
order
was
around
as
the
girls
called
it
pouncing
on
one
group
for
laughing
too
loud
and
on
another
for
making
too
much
noise
as
they
executed
grotesque
caricatures
of
the
way
they
intended
to
make
their
entries
on
the
stage
the
moment
her
back
was
turned
they
whispered
and
giggled
and
pranced
more
wildly
than
ever
turning
deep
bows
into
pirouettes
shaking
out
their
full
skirts
and
whirling
about
like
dervishes
everybody
took
care
to
lose
her
music
and
get
it
all
mixed
up
with
everybody
else
just
to
see
mlle
vivier
go
into
the
air
here
that
missing
sheet
from
your
schubert
marguerite
oh
no
gabrielle
chopin
oh
all
the
scherzo
pages
have
gone
from
my
delibes
mademoiselle
mademoiselle
i
feel
so
faint
i
do
believe
i
play
oh
mademoiselle
i
forgot
to
bring
my
oh
yes
here
it
is
right
under
danielle
get
up
danielle
get
up
danielle
garnier
wo
get
off
my
music
oh
mademoiselle
ca
i
play
my
nocturne
instead
of
the
autumn
leaves
i
like
a
nocturne
just
ready
to
go
to
sleep
poor
mademoiselle
vivier
as
she
was
grew
more
and
more
frantic
rushing
about
a
dark
red
flush
on
her
thin
face
crying
sh
much
more
loudly
than
the
girls
were
whispering
exhorting
them
angrily
to
have
some
manners
not
to
behave
like
so
many
barbarians
and
to
realize
the
seriousness
of
the
occasion
the
gambert
music
prize
at
stake
but
one
of
those
school
traditions
originating
god
only
knows
how
and
utterly
impervious
to
exhortations
from
any
faculty
decreed
in
that
school
that
the
gambert
music
prize
was
a
joke
a
scream
of
a
joke
the
girls
would
kill
themselves
with
work
and
worry
to
win
any
other
prize
for
dramatic
recitation
for
dancing
even
for
french
composition
much
as
they
hated
that
but
care
who
won
the
music
prize
they
would
not
although
of
course
it
was
exciting
to
have
no
classes
that
afternoon
to
wear
your
best
white
dress
and
parade
out
on
the
stage
they
had
handed
down
from
one
school
generation
to
another
the
fixed
idea
that
gambert
had
been
short
and
ridiculously
fat
and
they
enraged
their
teachers
by
drawing
on
the
margins
of
their
music
impudent
sketches
of
a
paunchy
bald
little
man
ceremoniously
bestowing
a
huge
wreath
on
a
scrawny
girl
whereas
as
a
matter
of
historic
fact
gambert
had
been
a
very
bourgeois
who
in
his
youth
had
been
a
dashing
lieutenant
under
napoleon
i
also
the
gambert
prize
was
not
a
wreath
at
all
but
an
album
of
piano
music
beautifully
bound
in
bright
red
leather
which
because
the
mother
superior
feared
arousing
the
vanity
of
the
winner
was
privately
bestowed
behind
the
scenes
but
historic
facts
have
no
bearing
on
a
cherished
school
joke
of
long
standing
for
the
girls
the
gambert
prize
continued
always
to
be
one
gigantic
lark
one
of
those
perennial
farces
the
indestructible
quality
of
which
so
endears
them
to
fourteen
and
fifteen
year
olds
this
year
they
had
a
new
variation
on
their
usual
fooleries
elise
fortier
told
them
that
her
young
lady
cousin
had
discovered
something
as
good
as
the
rouge
which
was
so
strictly
forbidden
to
them
by
the
sisters
that
its
very
name
was
not
allowed
to
be
pronounced
in
school
if
you
bent
over
double
and
hung
your
head
upside
down
way
over
thus
till
it
was
on
the
same
level
with
your
knees
and
held
it
there
till
you
felt
as
though
you
burst
you
have
the
loveliest
color
in
your
cheeks
just
like
an
actress
of
course
they
all
wanted
to
look
like
actresses
what
could
be
more
delightful
than
to
look
like
an
actress
in
an
instant
the
horrified
mademoiselle
vivier
was
treated
to
an
appalling
spectacle
all
of
her
charges
utterly
forgetting
their
manners
or
even
decency
were
stooping
double
their
full
starched
skirts
sticking
out
at
acute
angles
behind
and
to
the
tune
of
muffled
shrieks
of
laughter
were
dangling
and
shaking
their
heads
like
so
many
lunatics
their
carefully
dressed
hair
sweeping
the
floor
she
rushed
at
the
nearest
one
marise
allen
and
forced
her
back
to
an
upright
position
but
this
did
not
improve
things
when
marise
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
others
like
great
white
mushrooms
stooping
and
shaking
she
burst
out
into
anything
but
a
muffled
shout
of
laughter
which
brought
them
all
up
one
after
another
to
gaze
and
scream
and
lean
convulsed
and
hysterical
against
the
walls
it
was
a
critical
moment
the
curtain
was
due
to
go
up
and
the
girls
were
really
out
of
hand
mademoiselle
vivier
could
do
nothing
with
them
they
had
lost
control
of
themselves
her
experienced
eye
knew
the
signs
in
a
moment
more
one
of
the
more
ones
would
begin
to
cry
and
then
good
god
what
a
mess
what
diabolically
infernal
creatures
girls
were
to
handle
how
sick
she
was
of
their
imbecility
she
ran
hastily
around
to
the
side
door
and
beckoning
in
the
mother
superior
told
her
what
was
happening
the
nun
nodded
understandingly
meditated
for
an
instant
casting
about
in
her
mind
and
then
her
aged
face
taking
on
an
expression
of
majestic
calm
she
swept
back
to
the
little
room
behind
the
stage
the
girls
were
startled
to
see
her
and
alarmed
by
the
intense
gravity
of
her
face
my
children
she
said
quietly
in
the
clear
gentle
masterful
voice
which
had
kept
the
community
in
subservience
to
her
for
thirty
years
my
children
she
bent
her
wasted
old
face
on
them
raising
one
thin
white
hand
peremptorily
her
long
flowing
black
sleeve
gave
a
commanding
amplitude
to
this
gesture
my
little
children
lift
up
your
hearts
she
waited
an
instant
till
she
held
every
eye
and
then
she
said
reverently
my
children
at
every
important
moment
of
our
lives
we
must
turn
to
our
very
holy
mother
to
bless
us
before
you
go
on
the
stage
to
represent
your
school
in
public
and
to
do
honor
to
music
which
god
has
blessed
as
an
instrument
of
good
let
us
pray
our
mother
to
be
with
you
and
guide
you
she
bowed
her
head
hypnotically
all
the
young
heads
bowed
with
hers
she
began
in
a
low
murmur
ave
maria
sancta
tu
in
mulieribus
all
the
young
voices
murmured
with
her
discharging
in
the
reverenced
words
the
nervous
tension
of
their
excitement
and
frolic
when
they
finished
they
were
all
quiet
with
serious
faces
the
mother
superior
raised
her
hand
over
them
murmuring
a
short
inaudible
prayer
of
her
own
there
was
an
instant
silence
go
tell
mathurin
to
raise
the
curtain
said
the
reverend
mother
hurriedly
in
a
low
tone
to
mademoiselle
vivier
a
command
which
mademoiselle
vivier
lost
no
time
in
executing
chapter
xviii
marise
had
noticed
as
she
left
the
stage
that
madame
garnier
was
there
with
her
son
oh
yes
danielle
said
her
brother
was
back
from
america
now
he
be
tagging
around
everywhere
tied
to
his
as
papa
said
all
young
frenchmen
were
yes
they
were
holding
hands
this
minute
how
papa
would
laugh
to
see
that
as
much
as
he
did
when
frenchmen
with
beards
kissed
each
other
and
now
he
be
everlastingly
coming
in
with
his
tiresome
mother
on
maman
days
at
home
to
fidget
and
stammer
and
drop
his
teaspoon
oh
well
she
thought
with
a
superior
condescension
he
had
been
hardly
more
than
a
boy
just
out
of
the
lycée
only
he
might
be
better
now
perhaps
he
had
got
rid
of
a
little
of
his
shyness
in
new
york
although
for
a
was
of
course
no
age
at
all
the
fashion
at
school
just
then
was
to
look
down
on
boys
and
young
men
as
green
and
insipid
the
ideal
of
all
the
girls
was
an
man
of
forty
with
white
hair
and
black
eyebrows
a
little
pointed
gray
beard
and
such
sad
sad
eyes
every
girl
was
waiting
for
such
a
chance
to
devote
herself
to
healing
the
wounds
made
by
other
women
faithless
heartless
creatures
who
had
ravaged
his
youth
and
destroyed
his
faith
to
prove
to
him
what
a
woman
fidelity
and
love
could
be
and
then
die
in
his
remorseful
arms
of
slow
consumption
brought
on
by
his
neglect
or
as
the
pious
ones
had
it
to
bring
him
back
to
the
church
and
have
him
become
a
monk
after
your
death
or
perhaps
as
some
of
the
more
dramatic
ones
imagined
the
matter
to
find
a
plot
against
his
life
and
to
sacrifice
yourself
to
defeat
it
throwing
back
at
the
last
moment
the
hood
of
your
long
dark
cloak
and
showing
a
beautiful
white
satin
gown
stained
with
your
heart
blood
as
you
gasped
out
for
you
for
you
adored
réné
the
books
from
which
the
girls
got
these
ideas
and
many
others
not
so
harmless
were
kept
in
a
hole
hidden
behind
a
big
loose
stone
in
the
end
wall
of
the
school
garden
though
they
were
religiously
wrapped
in
the
damp
did
more
or
less
penetrate
but
spots
of
green
mold
and
limp
damp
pages
which
tore
unless
you
held
your
breath
as
you
turned
them
only
added
to
their
charm
as
you
read
them
two
or
three
heads
bent
over
the
page
while
a
friend
kept
guard
at
the
turn
of
the
path
by
the
magnolia
tree
marise
had
read
them
with
the
others
and
although
neither
father
nor
maman
paid
the
slightest
attention
to
what
she
read
and
there
were
lots
of
places
in
maman
novels
ever
so
much
worse
than
these
she
naturally
felt
an
agreeable
thrill
at
the
thought
of
what
an
explosion
there
would
be
if
they
were
ever
discovered
reading
at
school
it
was
the
fashion
with
the
girls
to
do
it
so
she
did
and
as
dramatically
as
any
of
the
others
but
far
down
deep
under
all
this
was
a
hermetically
sealed
chamber
where
she
kept
a
secret
disgust
for
the
whole
subject
of
falling
in
love
a
secret
distaste
for
men
old
or
young
and
a
furiously
held
determination
never
to
have
anything
to
do
with
them
it
was
all
very
well
to
carry
on
against
the
rules
and
to
with
the
girls
about
something
in
a
book
but
the
faintest
approach
of
the
same
thing
in
reality
froze
her
stiff
with
indignation
and
repugnance
when
walking
on
the
street
with
jeanne
some
young
man
cast
a
glance
of
admiration
at
her
or
some
workman
called
out
a
rough
compliment
she
shrank
away
from
them
hating
them
and
herself
a
feeling
which
old
jeanne
zealously
fostered
she
did
not
often
think
about
the
gray
cat
now
but
she
had
never
forgotten
it
and
she
had
picked
up
a
great
deal
more
information
than
she
had
had
about
what
made
people
like
isabelle
snigger
and
grin
when
there
was
talk
of
getting
a
husband
she
intensely
loathed
all
that
she
had
seen
and
learned
whether
it
were
the
shocked
nauseated
expression
on
the
face
of
one
of
the
older
nuns
at
school
when
she
forbade
any
talk
among
the
girls
over
the
gossip
that
one
of
the
had
let
a
young
man
into
the
kitchen
at
midnight
or
a
passage
in
one
of
maman
novels
which
she
had
found
lying
open
on
the
salon
table
and
read
before
she
could
stop
herself
every
such
experience
was
like
a
blow
on
a
bruised
spot
deep
under
the
surface
of
her
life
which
was
so
sore
now
that
it
ached
at
the
slightest
touch
ached
and
made
her
sick
she
had
learned
that
she
must
protect
it
at
all
costs
and
she
fought
off
blindly
whatever
seemed
to
threaten
it
fought
it
off
with
indignation
with
brusqueness
with
stiffness
with
silence
using
any
weapon
she
could
snatch
up
at
school
if
she
found
a
group
of
older
girls
with
their
heads
together
and
a
certain
expression
on
their
faces
the
weapon
was
often
simply
to
run
away
into
another
part
of
the
playground
i
can
run
away
faster
than
they
can
run
after
me
she
told
herself
fleeing
away
to
where
the
little
girls
were
playing
and
there
were
times
of
course
when
you
could
run
away
literally
but
marise
had
other
methods
of
running
away
the
best
one
being
a
sudden
change
of
subject
oh
isabelle
your
chignon
is
coming
untied
or
gabrielle
is
sister
ste
marie
coming
down
the
hall
jeanne
you
pulling
my
hair
and
she
had
found
too
that
to
head
people
off
from
beginning
on
the
sort
of
thing
you
had
to
run
away
from
there
was
no
better
device
than
lively
spirits
if
you
kept
joking
and
laughing
and
carrying
on
the
girls
did
have
time
to
lower
their
voices
look
over
their
shoulders
and
begin
to
talk
with
their
faces
close
to
yours
she
was
still
flushed
from
laughing
and
talking
and
carrying
on
when
she
emerged
from
the
into
the
half
empty
looking
for
her
wraps
and
saw
beside
jeanne
mme
garnier
and
her
son
evidently
waiting
for
danielle
for
mme
garnier
had
danielle
hat
and
cloak
on
her
arm
oh
zut
what
a
bore
she
have
to
speak
to
them
the
young
man
would
fidget
and
make
her
nervous
and
she
did
think
mme
garnier
the
tiresomest
of
all
the
frumps
who
came
to
call
on
maman
she
was
an
old
too
to
use
one
of
papa
expressions
she
pretended
to
say
such
sweet
things
to
maman
and
really
they
were
all
different
ways
to
slight
poor
maman
who
did
understand
half
the
time
but
marise
did
and
resented
it
for
her
poor
maman
good
morning
madame
garnier
she
said
with
a
little
bow
coming
up
to
them
and
good
morning
monsieur
jean
she
remembered
to
drop
her
eyes
following
the
precepts
of
the
teacher
of
deportment
and
profited
by
the
gesture
to
despise
mme
shoes
stuffed
lumpily
full
like
badly
made
sausages
when
mme
garnier
finished
a
long
speech
she
did
mean
a
word
of
about
how
nicely
marise
had
played
oh
thank
you
very
much
madame
garnier
she
answered
looking
up
for
a
moment
jeanne
put
her
hat
and
coat
on
now
as
danielle
romped
in
talking
at
the
top
of
her
voice
madame
garnier
with
the
perfunctory
air
of
one
attending
to
a
familiar
duty
savagely
reproached
her
for
boisterousness
and
general
heathenishness
of
manners
danielle
took
this
as
it
was
meant
and
paying
not
the
slightest
attention
to
the
rebuke
went
on
talking
at
the
top
of
her
voice
telling
her
mother
and
brother
all
about
the
foolishness
back
of
the
scenes
it
was
simply
she
shouted
laughing
so
that
no
one
but
marise
had
any
idea
what
she
was
talking
about
i
thought
i
die
did
you
marise
you
never
saw
anything
in
your
life
so
funny
all
of
us
wrong
side
up
with
our
heads
oh
ha
ha
ha
she
and
marise
went
off
into
peals
of
laughter
which
they
immediately
suppressed
to
giggles
and
then
to
smothered
muffled
gasps
as
they
saw
the
reverend
mother
dignified
black
draperies
moving
down
the
they
hear
from
it
at
school
if
reverend
mother
caught
them
in
such
a
breach
of
manners
as
in
a
public
who
won
the
prize
my
darling
whispered
jeanne
in
marise
ear
as
she
smoothed
down
the
collar
of
her
coat
oh
i
did
marise
whispered
back
casually
she
had
left
the
big
red
album
of
morceaux
de
salon
with
mlle
vivier
because
she
knew
if
she
tried
to
carry
it
home
and
passed
by
a
she
would
be
greeted
with
howls
of
jeering
laughter
she
would
bring
some
paper
to
wrap
it
up
we
may
as
well
walk
along
together
said
mme
garnier
now
our
road
lies
your
way
jeanne
dropped
respectfully
behind
mme
garnier
walked
with
marise
danielle
with
her
brother
marise
shot
one
sideways
glance
at
mme
garnier
as
they
started
along
the
sidewalks
sapristi
as
jeanne
said
what
an
ugly
hat
how
could
anybody
not
just
drop
dead
to
be
seen
with
such
a
horror
on
yes
madame
she
answered
politely
at
random
not
paying
any
attention
to
mme
garnier
drone
how
vulgar
it
was
to
let
your
dress
wrinkle
across
the
back
where
the
top
of
your
corset
came
and
it
was
worse
to
let
it
cave
in
in
front
at
the
same
place
when
she
was
grown
up
she
would
never
let
dress
do
that
marise
reflected
with
the
utmost
satisfaction
on
the
excellent
cut
and
hang
of
her
own
dress
there
had
been
a
better
one
there
and
she
had
silk
stockings
while
most
of
the
girls
had
clumsy
cotton
ones
or
at
best
lisle
thread
jeanne
certainly
did
know
how
to
buy
clothes
and
papa
never
said
a
word
against
paying
the
bills
well
she
could
wear
them
too
she
had
style
she
cast
a
pleased
sideways
glance
at
her
slim
straight
silhouette
reflected
in
the
large
window
of
a
shop
saw
in
the
same
mirror
mme
garnier
uninteresting
figure
and
then
surprisingly
she
also
caught
a
glimpse
of
jeanne
behind
the
others
her
handkerchief
at
her
eyes
as
if
she
were
crying
marise
stopped
short
and
turned
sharply
to
look
back
for
mercy
sake
what
could
be
the
matter
with
jeanne
why
yes
she
was
she
was
actually
crying
the
big
tears
rolling
down
her
leathery
cheeks
with
an
unceremonious
excuse
to
mme
garnier
marise
left
her
planted
there
on
the
sidewalk
and
darted
back
to
jeanne
asking
anxiously
what
had
happened
jeanne
looked
at
her
fondly
her
wrinkled
old
face
bright
with
love
i
am
thanking
our
holy
mother
and
all
the
saints
for
your
triumph
my
darling
she
said
her
voice
trembling
all
this
day
i
have
been
praying
for
you
all
this
day
marise
first
impulse
was
to
inquire
stupidly
what
triumph
and
her
next
was
to
burst
into
laughter
as
she
realized
that
jeanne
had
worked
herself
up
so
about
that
old
gambert
music
prize
of
all
things
but
these
gusts
had
come
and
gone
before
the
expression
of
her
face
had
had
time
to
change
and
when
they
had
gone
all
she
could
see
was
the
affection
shining
in
the
old
woman
eyes
dear
old
jeanne
her
think
it
was
a
triumph
she
should
never
know
anything
else
about
it
bless
her
marise
remembered
danielle
the
mocking
and
glanced
uneasily
towards
where
the
garniers
stood
waiting
for
her
to
go
on
with
them
no
danielle
had
not
heard
jeanne
was
safe
marise
had
grown
so
that
she
no
longer
needed
to
reach
up
to
put
her
arms
around
the
neck
of
the
tall
old
woman
and
kiss
her
hard
on
both
cheeks
i
owe
my
victory
to
thee
dear
jeanne
to
thy
prayers
she
whispered
fervently
and
i
shall
never
never
forget
it
all
this
was
a
lie
of
course
but
lies
were
easy
to
tell
and
what
harm
were
they
if
you
made
somebody
more
comfortable
by
telling
them
she
pirouetted
about
on
her
toes
and
ran
back
to
take
her
place
with
mme
garnier
jeanne
had
bad
news
from
one
of
her
family
she
murmured
pensively
in
answer
to
mme
garnier
look
of
inquiry
oh
bah
she
thought
carelessly
what
was
one
more
lie
to
head
off
an
old
cat
like
that
besides
it
was
amusing
to
see
how
easy
it
was
to
lie
how
with
one
little
phrase
this
way
or
that
you
could
change
facts
after
she
had
come
in
and
gone
to
her
room
to
change
to
her
usual
dark
woolen
with
the
linen
apron
over
it
marise
happened
to
glance
out
through
the
lace
curtain
over
her
window
and
saw
that
mme
garnier
son
was
sitting
on
the
bench
across
the
street
in
front
of
the
château
vieux
well
that
was
queer
why
had
he
gone
on
with
his
mother
and
danielle
she
looked
again
to
make
sure
herself
hidden
at
one
side
behind
the
heavy
tapestry
curtain
as
jeanne
had
taught
her
lest
she
be
seen
by
men
on
the
street
yes
it
was
danielle
brother
sure
enough
well
what
could
he
be
doing
there
she
turned
back
to
her
greenish
mirror
to
take
off
the
white
ribbon
from
her
hair
and
found
that
she
had
a
dim
recollection
that
before
he
went
away
to
america
he
used
to
sit
on
that
bench
in
the
late
afternoon
and
evening
there
was
something
unpleasant
connected
with
that
vague
memory
and
after
a
time
that
came
to
her
also
she
had
heard
anna
etchergary
the
concierge
and
jeanne
laughing
about
it
and
had
overheard
them
conjecture
that
the
young
man
was
no
such
innocent
mother
boy
as
he
seemed
and
then
they
had
seen
that
marise
was
there
and
stopped
abruptly
looking
at
her
with
the
expression
that
she
hated
before
she
went
in
to
dinner
she
looked
out
once
more
to
see
if
he
were
still
there
yes
there
he
was
leaning
forward
the
light
from
the
full
on
his
face
marise
could
see
that
he
was
pale
but
there
was
a
smile
on
his
lips
as
if
his
thoughts
were
very
pleasant
when
she
stepped
into
the
salon
she
did
not
for
a
moment
see
that
maman
was
already
there
because
she
stood
at
one
side
of
the
window
half
hidden
in
the
thick
tapestry
curtain
looking
out
through
the
lace
over
the
glass
by
the
expression
of
her
back
marise
knew
that
she
too
was
looking
at
mme
garnier
son
on
the
bench
for
an
instant
as
though
marise
fingers
had
dropped
on
metal
the
wild
idea
came
to
her
that
it
was
at
maman
that
was
smiling
that
it
was
for
maman
that
he
sat
there
she
jerked
herself
away
angrily
and
instantaneously
from
this
thought
ashamed
of
herself
she
was
getting
like
jeanne
like
the
girls
at
school
maman
had
heard
her
move
and
now
turned
sharply
around
from
the
window
with
the
startled
look
of
some
one
into
whose
you
walked
without
knocking
at
the
door
but
marise
never
knocked
at
the
salon
door
before
going
in
why
should
she
have
thought
of
it
maman
drew
the
heavy
curtain
over
the
window
with
a
sweep
of
her
bare
white
arm
for
maman
was
in
grande
tenue
with
her
mauve
satin
evening
dress
on
and
a
camellia
in
her
hair
marise
first
thought
was
that
she
was
to
have
another
solitary
dinner
oh
maman
are
you
going
out
certainly
not
what
makes
you
think
i
am
asked
maman
quickly
she
added
because
it
was
perfectly
evident
what
made
marise
think
it
the
belt
on
this
dress
has
been
changed
and
i
tried
it
on
to
see
if
it
was
right
and
then
i
saw
it
was
dinner
time
marise
was
about
to
say
something
about
the
flower
in
her
hair
but
her
sensitiveness
to
what
other
people
were
feeling
made
her
shut
her
lips
she
looked
hard
at
her
mother
who
made
herself
opaque
looking
back
at
marise
her
face
and
eyes
and
mouth
firmly
closed
over
what
was
in
her
mind
being
able
to
see
only
the
surface
marise
took
that
in
with
a
fresh
impression
of
not
having
looked
at
maman
for
some
time
how
pretty
she
was
with
her
hair
like
gold
threads
catching
the
light
and
how
different
from
her
crinkly
hair
like
a
golden
mist
around
her
head
were
the
thick
thick
petals
of
the
camellia
with
their
dense
close
surface
jeanne
came
to
the
door
madame
is
served
she
said
in
a
correct
tone
standing
aside
as
they
came
out
she
did
not
look
at
marise
at
all
but
marise
knew
perfectly
well
that
she
too
was
wondering
about
the
evening
dress
and
the
flower
marise
began
to
try
to
invent
some
plausible
explanation
for
it
which
she
could
let
drop
in
talk
as
they
walked
to
school
marise
had
lessons
to
get
that
evening
lots
of
them
and
hard
ones
as
usual
after
dinner
she
went
back
to
her
room
opened
her
history
and
began
it
was
very
still
in
the
apartment
no
sound
at
all
from
maman
in
the
salon
of
course
jeanne
and
isabelle
were
both
across
the
landing
in
the
other
kitchen
doing
the
work
as
they
always
were
unless
maman
expected
callers
marise
leaned
over
her
table
and
concentrated
with
all
her
might
on
the
rôle
played
by
colbert
in
the
economic
organization
of
the
seventeenth
century
she
was
trying
to
memorize
the
outline
of
his
introduction
of
sounder
in
government
administration
when
all
at
once
there
in
her
mind
instead
of
louis
xiv
and
his
court
was
the
picture
of
maman
standing
beside
the
window
looking
out
if
marise
were
now
to
step
quickly
into
the
salon
would
she
again
find
maman
marise
tossed
her
head
angrily
at
the
possibility
of
her
doing
such
a
sneaky
thing
as
to
go
to
see
like
some
nasty
idea
of
jeanne
that
was
she
drew
her
history
closer
to
her
changed
her
position
and
went
on
studying
colbert
a
souvent
répété
que
par
le
commerce
pays
although
she
had
not
meant
to
she
started
up
and
went
to
the
window
opening
the
heavy
curtains
a
tiny
crack
to
look
out
yes
he
was
still
there
two
hours
after
they
had
left
him
he
had
not
even
gone
home
for
dinner
but
old
madeleine
the
flower
seller
must
have
passed
by
on
her
way
home
after
shutting
up
her
for
now
he
had
a
white
rose
bud
in
his
hands
looking
down
at
it
fixedly
turning
it
about
between
his
fingers
once
in
a
while
touching
a
petal
delicately
or
holding
it
up
to
draw
in
its
fragrance
marise
pulled
the
curtain
shut
and
hurried
back
to
the
improvement
of
the
french
army
from
on
she
felt
very
miserable
as
though
eaten
something
she
ought
not
to
was
it
a
headache
she
had
heard
ladies
talk
so
much
about
headaches
and
had
never
had
one
yes
it
must
be
a
headache
that
was
it
her
first
headache
by
thinking
about
it
she
felt
it
very
distinctly
now
in
the
back
of
her
head
like
a
great
weight
there
drawing
her
head
back
she
tried
to
think
of
colbert
she
looked
hard
at
the
familiar
picture
of
colbert
rubbing
his
hands
in
glee
over
all
the
work
piled
up
on
his
desk
but
what
she
saw
was
maman
standing
at
one
side
of
the
window
looking
out
was
that
maman
she
heard
moving
about
in
the
salon
what
time
was
it
was
it
time
for
her
to
go
to
bed
the
soapy
dark
green
clock
on
her
mantel
piece
showed
only
half
past
eight
too
early
she
started
at
a
sudden
sound
her
hand
beginning
to
tremble
the
rang
jeanne
and
isabelle
were
both
on
the
other
side
of
the
landing
and
would
not
hear
she
listened
her
hands
and
feet
cold
heard
maman
go
to
the
door
herself
and
garnier
voice
asking
if
monsieur
and
madame
and
mademoiselle
allen
were
at
home
maman
laughed
and
said
that
monsieur
was
away
on
business
and
mademoiselle
was
of
course
busy
with
her
lessons
but
madame
was
there
marise
heard
mme
garnier
son
also
laugh
nervously
and
say
that
he
would
come
in
for
a
moment
to
pay
his
respects
to
madame
they
both
spoke
english
which
had
learned
so
well
in
new
york
well
why
not
in
america
anybody
might
happen
to
make
an
evening
call
at
half
past
eight
and
mme
garnier
son
had
just
been
in
america
heavens
how
her
head
ached
she
would
go
to
bed
anyway
whether
it
was
time
or
not
she
undressed
rapidly
and
getting
into
bed
pulled
the
covers
over
her
head
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
lay
thus
for
ages
her
eyes
pinched
shut
in
the
smothering
air
under
the
blankets
then
she
pulled
them
down
to
breathe
and
found
that
she
had
forgotten
to
put
out
her
candle
which
was
guttering
low
and
showing
by
the
clock
that
her
ages
had
been
less
than
an
hour
it
was
twenty
minutes
past
nine
she
blew
out
her
candle
and
decided
that
jeanne
or
no
jeanne
she
must
have
more
air
she
was
suffocating
she
drew
the
curtains
aside
and
secure
in
the
darkness
of
the
room
opened
both
sides
of
the
window
wide
the
fresh
air
came
in
like
waking
up
from
a
nightmare
but
she
had
not
waked
up
for
there
on
the
bench
across
the
street
was
mme
garnier
son
again
had
she
dreamed
that
he
had
come
to
the
door
how
strangely
he
sat
now
flung
down
sideways
his
face
hidden
on
his
arm
as
marise
stared
understanding
nothing
of
what
she
saw
he
started
up
spasmodically
as
though
some
one
had
struck
him
from
behind
then
he
collapsed
again
his
face
buried
on
his
arm
after
this
he
was
perfectly
motionless
like
everything
around
him
the
somber
wall
of
the
château
vieux
the
sickly
light
of
the
the
bench
the
rough
the
vacant
gray
shutters
of
the
department
store
further
along
the
street
as
marise
stood
there
shivering
in
her
staring
she
heard
maman
quick
light
step
at
the
other
end
of
the
corridor
and
the
sound
of
maman
voice
humming
a
little
trilling
song
she
turned
her
head
and
saw
the
cheerful
yellow
flicker
of
a
candle
coming
nearer
her
open
door
maman
was
going
down
to
her
to
get
ready
for
bed
she
thought
of
course
that
marise
was
in
bed
and
asleep
by
this
time
and
when
she
came
by
looking
down
at
the
lighted
candle
in
the
pretty
little
gilt
she
did
not
even
glance
into
the
dark
room
where
the
child
stood
bewildered
for
the
instant
she
was
framed
in
the
square
of
the
open
door
she
was
brilliantly
painted
on
the
darkness
all
the
bright
colors
of
her
fair
hair
her
shining
eyes
her
red
lips
softly
gleaming
in
the
warm
golden
light
of
the
little
flame
the
picture
was
printed
indelibly
on
the
child
wide
eyes
sensitized
by
the
darkness
and
long
after
the
sound
of
the
gay
little
song
had
died
away
long
years
after
the
sound
of
the
light
footstep
was
silent
marise
could
see
hung
on
the
blackness
around
her
bed
at
night
the
shining
picture
in
the
quivering
living
flame
of
the
candle
the
dense
waxy
petals
of
the
camellia
against
the
vaporous
blonde
hair
the
smiling
curved
lips
the
velvet
white
of
the
slender
bare
neck
and
arms
the
rich
sheen
of
the
mauve
satin
flowing
about
the
quick
light
feet
she
got
into
bed
warmed
comforted
nothing
could
be
the
matter
if
maman
was
smiling
so
cheerfully
she
fell
asleep
at
once
desperately
tired
giving
up
as
an
unanswerable
and
no
longer
very
interesting
riddle
the
question
of
what
was
the
trouble
with
mme
garnier
son
but
in
the
night
without
knowing
how
she
found
herself
once
more
by
the
open
window
she
had
been
dreaming
she
had
got
up
to
see
about
something
in
her
dream
something
about
why
there
he
was
still
on
the
bench
all
huddled
and
stooped
together
now
his
face
hidden
in
both
arms
crossed
on
his
knees
perhaps
he
had
dropped
asleep
there
he
would
be
cold
when
he
woke
up
how
chilly
it
still
was
at
night
well
yes
it
was
evident
that
she
had
dreamed
it
about
his
ringing
at
the
door
she
plunged
back
under
the
covers
she
heard
the
long
sonorous
hoot
of
a
steamer
going
out
to
sea
and
was
asleep
before
it
died
away
she
overslept
in
the
morning
so
that
jeanne
when
she
came
with
the
tray
ran
to
shake
her
and
said
she
must
hurry
to
dress
or
she
would
be
late
to
school
marise
sprang
up
thinking
of
nothing
but
the
reprimand
she
risked
and
flung
on
her
clothes
stopping
to
bite
off
big
mouthfuls
of
the
buttered
croissants
and
drink
big
swallows
of
the
jeanne
buttoned
her
behind
while
she
brushed
furiously
at
her
hair
where
are
my
books
oh
never
mind
that
last
hook
never
show
oh
just
without
my
gloves
no
i
do
my
coat
the
sun
is
so
warm
she
ran
out
to
the
corridor
snatched
her
hat
and
her
teeth
set
in
the
last
morsel
of
her
bread
darted
down
the
hall
jeanne
galloping
stiffly
behind
her
as
anxious
as
she
over
the
possibility
of
being
late
but
at
the
outer
door
she
paused
one
hand
on
the
knob
something
imperatively
urging
her
to
return
what
had
she
seen
as
she
passed
the
open
door
of
the
salon
just
the
every
morning
scene
isabelle
with
her
head
tied
up
in
a
cloth
a
in
her
hand
all
the
windows
wide
open
the
rugs
hanging
over
the
sills
the
sun
streaming
in
with
the
particular
clean
fresh
brilliance
it
always
seemed
to
have
early
in
the
morning
while
the
room
was
still
empty
of
life
how
could
there
have
been
anything
threatening
about
that
familiar
sight
it
was
face
she
had
been
standing
perfectly
still
the
long
handle
of
her
held
under
one
arm
looking
down
with
a
puzzled
expression
at
something
she
held
in
her
hand
marise
had
wheeled
so
instantly
in
answer
to
the
vague
warning
of
danger
that
she
was
back
at
the
door
of
the
salon
before
position
had
changed
she
still
stood
there
looking
down
at
a
wilted
white
and
now
her
face
was
suspicious
as
well
as
puzzled
glancing
up
she
said
meaningly
to
jeanne
over
marise
shoulder
now
do
you
suppose
came
from
i
found
it
on
the
floor
by
the
sofa
there
were
no
roses
brought
into
the
house
by
any
one
saw
yesterday
jeanne
thrust
her
long
stringy
neck
forward
and
passed
her
head
over
marise
shoulder
to
verify
the
fact
marise
could
see
the
glitter
in
her
eye
marise
cried
out
instantly
oh
my
poor
rose
where
it
was
i
looked
for
it
everywhere
last
night
to
put
it
in
water
jeanne
and
isabelle
turned
their
eyes
on
her
penetratingly
she
held
them
energetically
at
bay
hardening
her
gaze
defying
them
i
did
see
you
have
any
rose
yesterday
said
jeanne
but
marise
knew
by
the
tone
of
her
voice
that
she
was
not
sure
well
i
did
she
repeated
gabrielle
meunier
gave
it
to
me
out
of
her
bouquet
oh
i
so
sorry
it
spoiled
i
believe
you
that
it
spoiled
said
isabelle
carelessly
dropping
it
into
the
dustpan
somebody
must
have
stepped
on
it
to
crush
it
like
that
her
interest
in
it
was
gone
she
began
to
hum
her
favorite
and
to
shake
out
a
rug
marise
fled
down
the
slippery
waxed
stairway
three
steps
at
a
time
and
dashed
out
on
the
street
jeanne
and
panting
close
at
her
heels
how
she
hurried
how
breathlessly
she
hurried
that
morning
but
a
thought
inside
her
head
doggedly
kept
pace
with
her
hurry
chapter
xix
i
now
that
she
was
in
an
advanced
class
she
stayed
all
day
in
the
school
and
convent
taking
her
lunch
with
the
internats
in
the
refectory
so
that
it
was
always
six
before
jeanne
came
for
her
with
the
first
thin
twilight
beginning
to
fall
bluely
in
the
narrow
dark
streets
and
sunset
colors
glimmering
from
the
oily
surface
of
the
adour
that
evening
when
jeanne
came
for
her
she
said
that
maman
had
decided
to
go
back
for
a
day
or
two
to
saint
sauveur
for
the
sake
of
the
change
of
air
and
to
try
the
baths
again
jeanne
never
permitted
herself
the
slightest
overt
criticism
of
her
mistress
in
talking
to
marise
but
she
had
a
whole
gamut
of
intonations
and
inflections
which
marise
understood
perfectly
and
hated
hated
especially
because
there
was
nothing
there
to
quarrel
with
jeanne
about
jeanne
had
told
her
the
news
in
the
most
correct
and
colorless
words
but
what
she
had
really
said
was
just
another
of
her
idle
notions
gadding
off
for
more
sulphur
baths
nothing
in
the
world
the
matter
with
her
and
it
much
too
early
for
the
saint
sauveur
season
marise
could
resent
such
intimations
although
jeanne
was
too
adroit
to
give
her
grounds
for
open
reproach
she
had
her
own
gamut
of
expression
and
attitudes
with
which
to
punish
the
old
woman
she
immediately
stopped
chattering
looked
coldly
offended
and
walked
beside
jeanne
her
face
averted
from
her
out
towards
the
street
now
crowded
with
and
donkeys
and
men
with
starting
back
into
the
country
after
market
day
she
could
feel
that
she
was
making
jeanne
suffer
and
she
was
glad
of
it
as
she
kept
her
eyes
steadily
turned
through
the
tangle
of
traffic
across
to
the
sidewalk
on
the
other
side
not
more
than
ten
feet
away
so
narrow
was
the
street
she
caught
sight
of
mme
garnier
son
he
had
a
small
valise
in
his
hand
and
was
idling
along
as
though
he
were
waiting
for
something
as
she
looked
their
eyes
met
he
looked
at
her
hard
and
crossed
the
street
towards
her
he
came
swiftly
now
as
if
all
of
a
sudden
he
were
in
a
great
hurry
how
oddly
he
was
staring
at
her
not
as
though
he
recognized
her
as
though
he
took
her
for
somebody
else
oh
perhaps
he
was
looking
at
her
at
all
perhaps
there
was
somebody
behind
them
at
whom
he
was
staring
so
hard
the
tall
jerked
her
head
around
for
a
quick
glance
over
her
shoulder
but
there
was
nobody
else
on
the
sidewalk
the
young
man
had
come
up
to
them
now
had
taken
off
his
hat
and
stood
there
bowing
how
white
that
bluish
light
made
people
look
marise
and
jeanne
slackened
their
pace
for
an
instant
thinking
that
he
wished
to
speak
to
them
but
all
that
he
brought
out
was
good
evening
mademoiselle
in
a
low
voice
they
stood
for
an
instant
marise
feeling
very
awkward
as
though
she
had
misunderstood
something
then
he
put
his
hat
back
on
and
stooping
forward
as
though
he
were
tired
and
his
valise
heavy
hurried
on
marise
looked
over
her
shoulder
again
and
saw
that
he
was
almost
running
but
he
had
plenty
of
time
to
catch
that
train
to
lourdes
which
was
the
only
one
due
to
leave
bayonne
that
evening
jeanne
turn
had
come
in
the
little
guerilla
skirmish
between
marise
and
herself
turn
around
in
the
street
that
way
she
cried
in
a
shocked
tone
have
you
any
sense
of
what
is
proper
do
you
know
if
you
turn
around
like
that
just
after
a
young
man
has
passed
you
he
is
likely
to
think
that
you
are
after
she
had
no
idea
that
marise
was
really
guilty
of
such
a
heinous
misdemeanor
and
had
only
snatched
the
phrase
up
as
a
weapon
ii
that
night
jeanne
rolled
the
little
in
across
the
landing
and
setting
it
up
in
marise
room
slept
there
beside
her
this
was
what
they
had
done
before
when
maman
was
at
saint
sauveur
on
the
nights
when
father
had
to
be
away
too
isabelle
had
the
slightest
intention
of
sleeping
over
on
the
other
side
by
herself
and
she
always
came
too
bringing
her
own
sheets
to
put
on
maman
bed
she
remarked
that
she
could
afford
to
have
it
said
of
her
that
she
had
spent
the
night
in
the
apartment
without
another
woman
with
her
marise
did
not
see
in
the
least
why
any
one
should
object
to
having
this
said
of
her
but
the
tone
of
isabelle
voice
as
she
spoke
and
the
fact
that
it
had
something
to
do
with
passing
the
night
warned
her
off
from
asking
any
explanation
she
had
already
gleaned
from
many
sources
in
and
out
of
books
that
there
was
something
about
accounting
for
where
you
were
at
night
about
which
she
did
want
to
have
jeanne
and
isabelle
talk
so
she
began
to
sing
a
new
satirical
verse
to
the
air
of
maman
les
petits
bateaux
which
one
of
the
girls
had
made
up
that
day
everything
went
exactly
as
usual
the
next
morning
the
absence
of
the
mistress
of
the
house
not
making
the
faintest
difference
jeanne
and
isabelle
went
through
their
usual
domestic
ritual
in
exactly
the
same
order
whether
madame
told
them
or
not
indeed
whatever
she
might
tell
them
they
changed
no
slightest
tittle
of
what
they
did
as
she
had
long
ago
found
out
jeanne
brought
in
the
breakfast
tray
and
did
hair
as
usual
and
although
not
a
soul
had
stepped
into
the
salon
since
the
day
before
isabelle
was
skating
back
and
forth
on
the
waxed
floor
woolen
cloths
on
her
feet
when
marise
passed
the
door
outside
it
was
a
breathless
still
day
with
a
hazy
sun
very
hot
for
so
early
in
the
spring
as
they
crossed
the
adour
marise
caught
the
first
whiff
of
its
summer
smell
compounded
of
decaying
tar
and
stale
fish
she
and
jeanne
said
little
although
they
had
wordlessly
made
up
their
tiff
the
evening
before
and
had
gone
to
sleep
after
exchanging
their
usual
hearty
kisses
their
quarrels
although
frequent
never
lasted
long
everybody
at
school
was
dull
too
from
the
first
heat
the
hours
seemed
very
long
with
little
in
them
marise
felt
listless
and
rather
cross
and
dreaded
the
exertion
of
taking
her
music
lesson
although
she
usually
looked
forward
eagerly
to
those
hours
with
mlle
hasparren
the
best
and
happiest
of
her
days
at
four
the
called
to
take
her
home
she
also
was
hot
and
tired
and
fearfully
nervous
she
said
after
a
terribly
trying
day
in
her
with
her
squirming
little
basques
as
a
rule
she
and
marise
had
a
good
deal
to
say
to
each
other
because
mlle
hasparren
was
the
only
person
marise
knew
who
had
any
interest
in
america
the
rest
never
spoke
of
it
or
if
by
chance
they
did
they
only
asked
about
buffaloes
and
indians
and
evidently
did
believe
her
when
she
said
she
never
seen
either
but
mlle
hasparren
knew
better
and
loved
to
talk
about
it
and
actually
knew
the
difference
between
the
civil
war
and
the
revolution
and
had
heard
of
abraham
lincoln
and
thought
he
was
a
greater
man
than
marise
who
was
reading
a
great
deal
of
victor
hugo
hardly
knew
whether
to
agree
with
this
startling
idea
or
not
but
she
felt
when
she
was
with
mlle
hasparren
that
it
was
safe
to
open
many
doors
which
she
usually
kept
locked
and
to
talk
with
her
about
things
she
never
dreamed
of
mentioning
to
anybody
else
which
did
not
of
course
at
all
prevent
her
from
wishing
to
goodness
mlle
hasparren
did
wear
such
fearful
hats
and
that
her
skirts
would
hang
better
but
this
hot
day
of
early
spring
she
thought
neither
of
america
or
of
hats
as
she
plodded
silently
beside
the
equally
weary
through
the
dusty
stone
streets
the
depression
which
had
hung
over
her
all
day
deepened
till
she
felt
ready
to
cry
wherever
she
looked
she
saw
maman
standing
in
that
stealthy
attitude
looking
out
of
the
window
mlle
hasparren
worn
swarthy
face
under
her
hat
was
plainer
than
usual
isabelle
let
them
in
to
the
empty
salon
with
her
usual
air
of
being
cheered
up
to
have
something
happen
and
bustlingly
arranged
two
seats
before
the
piano
mlle
hasparren
took
off
her
hat
and
pushed
her
fingers
through
her
graying
hair
marise
fumbled
among
the
music
on
the
piano
and
pulled
out
what
they
were
working
on
the
toccata
in
d
minor
she
flattened
it
out
with
both
hands
on
the
above
the
keys
and
sat
down
she
raised
her
fingers
made
sure
of
the
notes
of
the
first
twiddle
and
began
to
play
she
had
not
wished
to
take
this
she
had
been
hot
and
listless
and
tired
with
a
secret
heartache
and
a
dread
like
a
black
shadow
on
her
heart
she
had
sat
down
before
a
great
black
varnished
wooden
box
and
detached
indifferent
had
set
her
fingers
to
pushing
first
one
and
then
another
bit
of
wood
covered
with
white
bone
and
what
happened
out
of
the
black
varnished
box
like
the
mighty
genii
of
the
arabian
nights
soared
something
beautiful
and
strong
something
that
filled
the
dreary
empty
salon
and
her
heavy
heart
with
sonorous
life
something
which
like
the
genii
put
its
greatness
at
the
service
of
the
being
who
knew
the
charm
to
free
it
from
imprisonment
stronger
there
as
you
come
up
from
the
bass
said
mlle
hasparren
and
marise
knew
from
her
voice
that
she
too
was
soaring
up
and
yet
although
she
sounded
no
longer
dull
and
weary
but
strong
and
joyful
she
abated
nothing
of
her
exacting
rigor
no
do
blur
it
because
you
make
it
louder
do
lean
on
the
pedal
clean
power
of
stroke
the
thing
for
bach
now
try
again
roll
it
up
from
that
lowest
note
like
a
wave
she
listened
all
her
personality
concentrated
on
her
hearing
her
head
turned
sideways
her
eyes
fixed
on
a
point
in
the
very
far
distance
with
all
her
intelligence
she
listened
and
when
the
immature
intelligence
of
the
pupil
faltered
or
failed
she
came
swiftly
to
the
rescue
no
take
care
you
losing
yourself
in
that
passage
playing
each
note
correctly
but
you
have
the
sense
of
the
whole
thing
there
a
rhythmic
progression
there
that
starts
four
measures
back
and
does
end
till
you
swing
into
those
chords
do
lose
your
way
in
what
is
only
a
little
ornamentation
of
the
line
see
to
here
all
that
is
half
of
the
rhythmic
figure
and
here
it
is
repeated
in
the
bass
now
again
read
it
so
the
meaning
comes
out
the
nimble
flexible
young
fingers
went
flying
at
the
passage
again
guided
and
informed
by
the
ripe
soundness
of
the
older
mind
and
from
a
passage
which
marise
had
physically
mastered
as
mechanically
as
she
would
an
exercise
she
heard
the
speak
out
again
her
teacher
leaned
forward
beside
her
working
as
hard
as
marise
although
she
did
not
touch
the
keys
four
years
of
incessant
work
together
had
made
them
almost
like
one
mind
from
time
to
time
they
wiped
the
perspiration
away
from
their
foreheads
with
a
hasty
pass
of
their
handkerchiefs
mlle
hasparren
gesture
as
hurried
as
marise
pearly
in
the
treble
clear
clear
try
that
bar
of
triplets
again
again
again
once
more
there
now
start
at
the
double
bar
like
running
water
no
not
so
much
shading
ugh
that
not
classic
let
it
speak
for
itself
you
do
need
to
use
those
theatrical
swells
and
here
you
not
playing
gounod
start
that
movement
over
again
every
note
a
pearl
remember
string
them
together
in
a
necklace
do
jumble
them
in
a
heap
they
were
still
at
it
laboring
like
slaves
putting
their
backs
into
it
like
exalted
as
cherubim
when
jeanne
came
discreetly
to
the
door
to
look
in
on
them
this
was
her
decorous
method
of
intimating
that
she
was
about
to
put
marise
dinner
on
the
table
oh
là
là
cried
mlle
hasparren
is
it
as
late
as
that
and
my
sister
told
me
to
be
sure
to
start
early
enough
to
buy
some
salad
for
our
supper
she
slammed
on
her
hat
took
her
bag
and
darted
away
marise
got
up
feeling
numb
flung
her
arms
high
over
her
head
and
stretched
herself
like
a
cat
although
she
knew
that
like
any
other
vigorous
and
forthright
bodily
gesture
this
would
call
down
a
reproof
from
jeanne
as
not
being
convenable
but
she
did
not
care
what
jeanne
said
to
her
she
did
not
care
about
anything
in
the
world
but
the
waves
of
rhythm
and
the
clear
tinkling
rain
of
pearls
which
went
on
and
on
in
her
head
as
she
ate
her
solitary
dinner
and
studied
her
lessons
in
her
solitary
room
afterwards
when
jeanne
came
to
set
up
her
bed
for
the
night
she
remarked
what
a
horrid
sticky
hot
day
it
has
been
has
it
asked
marise
in
genuine
forgetfulness
of
the
weather
also
caught
up
into
another
world
as
she
was
she
forgot
for
an
hour
or
two
all
about
the
white
iii
but
she
was
reminded
of
it
as
she
opened
her
eyes
the
next
morning
it
was
her
fifteenth
birthday
and
to
celebrate
it
jeanne
had
already
been
out
to
the
market
and
brought
home
a
great
bouquet
of
white
she
was
loitering
around
pretending
to
pick
up
the
room
but
really
waiting
to
hear
what
marise
would
say
so
of
course
marise
must
conquer
the
nausea
that
white
gave
her
and
exclaim
that
they
were
lovely
and
kiss
jeanne
and
thank
her
and
lean
over
them
and
smell
them
rapturously
what
a
lot
of
this
sort
of
thing
there
was
to
do
marise
thought
if
you
did
want
to
hurt
people
feelings
or
let
them
suspect
things
you
did
want
them
to
know
jeanne
tried
to
restrain
herself
to
decorum
but
her
overwhelming
jealousy
of
any
one
else
who
touched
marise
life
was
too
much
for
her
they
nicer
than
that
one
wilted
old
thing
gabrielle
meunier
gave
you
hein
marise
understood
then
why
jeanne
had
chosen
white
down
below
the
surface
where
she
kept
her
real
feelings
she
heard
a
sick
sort
of
laugh
what
she
said
was
with
fervor
oh
yes
jeanne
a
thousand
times
better
you
might
as
well
make
it
a
thousand
times
while
you
were
about
it
well
i
should
hope
so
said
jeanne
satisfied
at
last
that
morning
when
marise
stepped
into
the
courtyard
at
school
a
group
of
older
girls
had
their
heads
together
over
a
newspaper
and
when
they
saw
her
they
all
started
elise
fortier
rolled
the
paper
up
rapidly
and
put
it
in
her
leather
portfolio
with
her
they
looked
at
her
very
oddly
four
years
ago
marise
would
have
run
up
to
them
demanding
what
the
matter
what
makes
you
look
so
funny
what
is
it
in
the
paper
that
was
before
she
became
aware
of
any
mire
in
the
world
invisible
into
which
almost
any
casual
inquiry
seemed
likely
to
plunge
you
marise
knew
what
it
was
to
have
some
of
that
indelibly
staining
mire
splashed
upon
her
from
a
look
an
intonation
or
a
phrase
that
meaningly
expressed
much
more
than
it
said
she
walked
with
a
desperate
wariness
now
trying
to
pick
her
way
in
the
dark
so
that
morning
she
was
only
afraid
that
the
girls
tell
her
what
it
was
they
had
found
in
the
paper
that
made
them
look
so
she
pretended
that
she
had
seen
nothing
ran
up
to
them
with
a
funny
story
to
tell
and
went
at
once
to
hang
up
her
wraps
in
the
hall
outside
the
door
sister
ste
julie
passed
her
and
said
my
child
it
seemed
to
marise
that
she
too
looked
queerly
at
her
she
reached
her
hand
over
her
shoulder
to
make
sure
her
dress
was
hooked
and
felt
of
the
ribbon
in
her
hair
no
mirrors
were
allowed
inside
the
school
and
convent
walls
or
she
would
have
stepped
to
look
in
one
to
see
what
was
wrong
at
eleven
while
the
class
in
advanced
geography
was
reciting
the
street
bell
rang
sister
ste
marie
went
to
answer
and
came
back
to
say
that
mlle
allen
was
wanted
her
maman
was
ill
and
the
bonne
had
come
for
her
all
the
girls
turned
instantly
and
looked
at
her
without
surprise
as
though
they
had
been
expecting
this
marise
started
up
suddenly
very
pale
put
on
her
wraps
in
a
great
hurry
and
ran
to
where
jeanne
was
waiting
for
her
jeanne
looked
just
as
usual
although
everything
else
seemed
to
have
changed
in
an
instant
and
to
look
threateningly
upon
marise
your
maman
is
home
from
the
baths
said
jeanne
as
though
she
were
saying
something
she
had
made
up
to
say
beforehand
and
she
feel
very
well
since
monsieur
is
not
here
i
thought
we
would
better
come
and
get
you
marise
seized
jeanne
arm
and
dug
her
fingers
deep
into
it
jeanne
jeanne
nothing
happened
maman
not
jeanne
said
with
the
very
accent
of
truth
no
no
no
madame
is
not
dead
never
fear
my
darling
she
is
only
very
nervous
she
said
it
with
the
very
accent
of
truth
but
marise
knew
perfectly
well
that
jeanne
could
say
anything
she
pleased
with
that
accent
she
never
believed
a
thing
jeanne
said
unless
she
knew
it
already
but
in
spite
of
herself
she
was
relieved
from
her
first
wild
panic
nothing
so
very
bad
could
have
happened
with
jeanne
standing
there
carved
out
of
brown
wood
just
as
usual
they
began
to
hurry
up
the
narrow
by
the
market
and
jeanne
told
her
a
little
more
maman
had
come
back
by
the
first
train
she
must
have
taken
the
afternoon
train
down
from
saint
sauveur
to
lourdes
and
have
waited
hours
in
the
station
at
lourdes
till
the
train
from
toulouse
came
along
and
she
had
come
in
perfectly
worn
out
staggering
and
pushed
right
by
isabelle
to
go
to
her
room
and
she
had
locked
the
door
and
answer
when
they
knocked
and
would
open
when
they
brought
a
tray
with
some
food
only
called
out
to
them
in
a
queer
hoarse
voice
to
go
get
soeur
ste
lucie
and
they
could
hear
her
crying
and
sobbing
so
they
had
sent
anna
etchergary
to
get
the
nun
and
she
jeanne
had
come
of
her
own
idea
to
get
marise
marise
read
into
this
jeanne
dislike
of
the
nun
and
her
usual
suspicious
idea
about
poor
maman
that
it
was
all
just
some
new
notion
of
hers
but
she
also
felt
that
the
old
woman
had
had
a
real
fright
and
she
walked
faster
and
faster
the
door
on
the
landing
was
ajar
and
inside
the
hall
they
saw
a
tall
old
monk
his
bare
feet
in
sandals
his
bald
head
bowed
over
his
clasped
hands
his
lips
moving
in
prayer
when
he
saw
the
girl
and
the
old
servant
he
made
way
for
them
to
pass
and
without
interrupting
his
prayers
motioned
them
to
enter
his
gesture
was
so
imperious
that
without
a
word
they
in
past
him
isabelle
her
eyes
wide
and
not
as
as
usual
was
standing
uncertainly
in
the
door
of
the
salon
her
apron
up
to
her
lips
looking
scared
soeur
ste
lucie
has
gone
in
to
madame
she
said
to
jeanne
in
a
whisper
she
said
you
and
mademoiselle
were
to
go
to
mademoiselle
room
and
wait
until
she
came
jeanne
inquired
wildly
with
a
silent
jerk
of
the
head
who
in
the
world
was
the
monk
who
stood
praying
before
madame
closed
door
and
isabelle
answered
with
a
desperate
rolling
of
her
eyes
that
she
had
no
more
idea
of
that
than
jeanne
they
all
went
down
the
corridor
on
to
marise
room
where
automatically
marise
took
off
her
hat
and
coat
she
saw
to
her
amazement
that
jeanne
had
dropped
down
on
the
crimson
quilt
on
the
bed
nothing
that
had
happened
had
startled
marise
so
much
as
to
see
this
almost
at
once
soeur
ste
lucie
entered
and
coming
up
to
marise
put
her
arms
around
her
and
kissed
her
very
tenderly
then
she
turned
and
motioned
the
two
servants
out
of
the
room
i
must
speak
to
mlle
marise
alone
she
said
isabelle
was
only
too
glad
to
go
but
jeanne
looked
furious
and
stood
for
a
moment
with
darkened
face
lowering
down
on
the
nun
as
if
she
were
on
the
point
of
defying
her
but
she
finally
thought
better
of
it
and
followed
isabelle
out
soeur
ste
lucie
stood
in
the
open
door
till
they
were
both
well
down
the
corridor
then
she
shut
it
carefully
and
came
back
to
marise
whose
heart
was
beating
wildly
and
whose
knees
were
shaking
under
her
soeur
ste
lucie
sat
down
and
made
marise
sit
down
holding
both
the
cold
hands
in
her
soft
kind
old
fingers
dear
child
there
are
times
in
every
life
when
we
must
ask
god
for
courage
your
mother
is
not
sick
or
hurt
but
she
needs
all
your
prayers
she
has
had
a
terrible
shock
a
dreadful
tragedy
that
took
place
before
her
eyes
and
she
will
need
all
the
help
our
holy
mother
can
give
her
to
recover
her
calm
it
seems
that
soeur
ste
lucie
stopped
an
instant
as
if
to
consider
how
to
put
what
she
had
to
say
and
changed
the
form
your
dear
mother
was
in
saint
sauveur
and
by
chance
a
person
from
bayonne
passed
through
whom
your
dear
mother
knew
and
it
seems
they
went
out
to
walk
together
as
any
one
might
and
descended
the
paths
and
steps
that
lead
visitors
down
the
face
of
the
gavarnie
gorge
towards
the
place
arranged
so
that
tourists
can
look
up
at
the
arch
of
the
great
bridge
and
then
nobody
knows
just
what
happened
the
water
was
very
high
and
violent
the
other
person
must
have
slipped
and
fallen
in
and
was
instantly
killed
by
being
flung
by
the
current
against
a
great
rock
your
dear
mother
saw
it
and
sensitive
and
as
she
is
it
it
slightly
unhinged
her
she
said
a
great
many
wild
things
soeur
ste
lucie
stopped
drew
a
long
breath
and
began
again
nothing
that
she
had
said
had
made
the
slightest
impression
on
marise
it
sounded
far
off
as
though
soeur
ste
lucie
were
reading
something
out
of
a
book
marise
could
not
seem
to
put
her
mind
on
it
and
when
she
did
she
could
not
understand
it
soeur
ste
lucie
went
on
but
by
the
mercy
of
god
i
had
just
written
her
that
the
holy
father
elie
was
once
more
here
and
after
they
had
got
the
body
out
of
the
water
and
carried
it
to
the
hotel
they
your
mother
remembered
about
father
elie
and
turning
in
her
trouble
to
the
only
source
of
strength
she
your
mother
wishes
to
make
a
retreat
for
a
few
days
at
our
convent
and
i
am
sure
that
it
is
much
the
best
thing
for
her
to
do
it
is
a
shelter
for
her
father
elie
is
with
her
now
i
have
sent
for
a
carriage
oh
but
ca
i
see
her
ca
i
kiss
her
how
long
will
she
be
away
cried
marise
wildly
starting
from
the
fascinated
immobility
in
which
she
had
gazed
at
the
nun
face
soeur
ste
lucie
laid
a
quieting
hand
on
her
shoulder
her
kind
old
face
yearning
over
the
child
dear
little
marise
i
think
it
will
be
better
for
your
mother
not
to
see
you
or
any
one
just
now
she
needs
quiet
perfect
quiet
marise
looked
at
her
hard
she
had
no
idea
whether
she
was
being
told
the
truth
or
only
some
kind
invention
which
they
thought
suitable
for
her
to
hear
ca
i
go
to
see
her
at
the
convent
she
asked
in
a
whisper
giving
up
the
first
point
oh
yes
yes
my
darling
time
only
a
little
later
when
your
mother
is
calmer
soeur
ste
lucie
face
shone
suddenly
radiantly
god
uses
all
means
to
his
great
ends
she
said
fervently
this
may
be
the
means
of
giving
your
dear
mother
in
the
end
the
holy
peace
of
faith
she
looked
so
serenely
trusting
and
hopeful
that
marise
felt
comforted
i
do
just
as
you
say
dear
soeur
she
said
in
a
trembling
voice
soeur
ste
lucie
drew
a
long
breath
as
though
she
had
been
steering
a
difficult
course
she
kissed
marise
again
told
her
to
stay
in
her
room
for
the
time
being
to
say
her
prayers
not
to
worry
her
maman
would
soon
be
all
right
and
probably
happier
than
she
had
ever
been
in
her
life
all
this
might
open
the
door
to
salvation
for
her
she
left
marise
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
closed
the
door
carefully
behind
her
but
not
so
carefully
that
marise
could
not
a
moment
later
hear
maman
crying
and
crying
and
crying
as
she
went
down
the
hall
and
out
of
the
door
marise
began
to
tremble
and
cry
at
the
sound
she
ran
to
her
window
and
saw
down
below
maman
her
hands
over
her
face
with
soeur
ste
lucie
arm
around
her
the
tall
old
monk
on
the
other
side
cross
the
sidewalk
and
get
into
the
carriage
as
the
carriage
rolled
away
the
weeping
child
at
the
window
remembered
that
soeur
ste
lucie
had
not
mentioned
who
the
person
from
bayonne
was
who
had
been
killed
well
what
did
marise
care
who
it
was
chapter
xx
it
occurred
to
marise
and
the
idea
of
a
responsibility
dried
her
tears
with
a
start
that
she
ought
to
get
word
somehow
to
papa
her
heart
sprang
up
to
think
that
perhaps
if
he
knew
maman
was
so
upset
he
would
come
back
at
once
she
did
somebody
so
much
beside
jeanne
and
isabelle
but
she
never
knew
papa
address
when
he
was
away
on
business
perhaps
there
was
something
on
maman
she
went
quickly
into
the
salon
drew
aside
the
curtains
which
shut
off
the
alcove
from
the
salon
and
began
rather
helplessly
to
fumble
among
papers
and
novels
there
were
very
few
letters
of
any
sort
maman
keep
up
her
correspondence
with
america
very
much
jeanne
had
heard
marise
moving
and
through
the
alcove
curtains
marise
saw
her
now
come
into
the
salon
with
a
basin
of
water
in
her
hand
pretending
that
she
needed
to
water
a
plant
marise
remembered
that
she
must
as
usual
arrange
something
to
present
to
jeanne
that
would
not
reflect
on
fancifulness
but
perhaps
soeur
ste
lucie
had
told
her
something
she
inquired
cautiously
but
jeanne
said
stiffly
still
outraged
at
having
been
shut
out
of
the
room
that
she
knew
nothing
everything
about
her
except
her
words
said
forcibly
that
she
cared
less
and
that
all
this
foolishness
was
a
part
of
the
usual
nonsense
oh
jeanne
a
terrible
thing
has
happened
to
poor
maman
she
saw
somebody
swept
away
in
the
gavarnie
and
killed
right
before
her
eyes
and
it
upset
her
fearfully
jeanne
sulkiness
vanished
in
the
delight
of
her
kind
at
having
any
inside
information
about
a
violent
death
or
a
scandal
marise
remembered
how
absorbed
and
excited
jeanne
had
been
when
somebody
in
the
apartment
overhead
had
taken
an
of
morphine
and
how
proud
she
had
been
to
have
everybody
in
the
market
stop
to
ask
her
details
killed
said
jeanne
with
a
greedy
eagerness
her
eyes
shining
how
killed
drowned
or
knocked
against
the
rocks
man
or
woman
have
they
got
the
body
out
marise
did
not
as
a
rule
enjoy
jeanne
interest
in
murders
and
deaths
and
kidnappings
but
this
time
she
welcomed
it
and
passed
on
to
the
old
woman
all
she
could
remember
of
what
soeur
ste
lucie
had
told
her
jeanne
was
much
disappointed
that
marise
had
not
heard
the
name
of
the
dead
person
but
marise
promised
to
tell
her
as
soon
as
the
paper
was
out
the
next
morning
since
it
would
probably
be
printed
and
with
the
mention
there
came
back
to
her
with
one
of
those
sickening
lurches
the
recollection
of
the
girls
putting
their
heads
together
over
the
newspaper
at
school
and
then
looking
at
her
so
oddly
and
hiding
it
away
it
was
probably
in
this
morning
paper
she
said
to
jeanne
if
you
get
it
i
read
it
to
you
but
jeanne
came
back
in
a
moment
with
an
astonished
face
saying
that
isabelle
reported
that
of
all
queer
things
mlle
hasparren
the
had
stopped
in
that
morning
and
asked
to
borrow
the
paper
jeanne
astonishment
never
on
any
occasion
remained
more
than
an
instant
untinged
with
suspicion
and
marise
who
knew
the
old
face
so
well
saw
the
suspicious
expression
begin
slowly
to
color
the
surprise
what
in
the
name
of
god
did
the
hasparren
want
with
our
newspaper
she
asked
herself
aloud
obviously
snuffing
around
a
new
scent
marise
hated
jeanne
face
when
it
looked
like
that
crafty
and
zestful
as
though
she
were
licking
her
chops
over
a
nasty
smell
they
were
still
standing
in
the
alcove
beside
the
when
the
rang
jeanne
turned
to
go
heard
isabelle
open
and
standing
between
the
curtains
turned
her
head
to
listen
marise
heard
nothing
but
a
man
voice
and
isabelle
answering
oui
monsieur
oui
monsieur
oui
monsieur
but
jeanne
started
stiffened
and
darting
on
to
the
door
looked
around
the
corner
the
door
shut
steps
were
heard
at
the
other
end
of
the
long
hallway
isabelle
was
evidently
bringing
the
visitor
to
the
salon
jeanne
looked
around
wildly
at
marise
her
face
suddenly
the
color
of
lead
her
eyes
the
steps
were
nearer
there
seemed
to
be
more
than
one
man
jeanne
ran
back
pushed
marise
into
the
chair
in
the
corner
of
the
alcove
motioning
her
violently
but
without
a
sound
to
keep
perfect
silence
and
noiselessly
drew
the
curtains
together
before
the
alcove
marise
heard
her
step
quickly
back
to
the
stand
where
the
plant
stood
and
the
click
of
her
tin
basin
against
the
of
the
pot
and
then
she
heard
her
say
in
exactly
her
usual
voice
only
with
a
little
surprise
messieurs
what
can
i
do
for
you
we
have
been
sent
said
a
man
deep
voice
and
not
a
monsieur
but
a
common
sort
of
man
marise
could
tell
by
his
accent
and
intonation
to
see
and
question
madame
allen
jeanne
evidently
went
through
some
pantomime
of
astonishment
for
he
explained
a
part
of
the
inquest
over
the
death
of
garnier
but
the
maid
tells
me
she
is
already
not
here
jeanne
answered
and
if
she
caught
her
breath
or
flinched
there
was
not
the
smallest
external
sign
of
it
no
our
poor
lady
was
so
terribly
upset
over
seeing
such
an
awful
thing
that
the
doctor
has
just
sent
her
for
a
few
quiet
days
retreat
at
the
holy
ghost
convent
what
a
terrible
thing
to
be
sure
m
the
man
answered
wearily
eh
bien
we
shall
have
to
see
her
retreat
or
no
retreat
we
have
the
blanks
to
fill
out
by
all
witnesses
and
she
is
the
only
witness
this
is
the
inspecteur
from
st
sauveur
oh
the
poor
lady
is
in
no
state
to
be
questioned
said
jeanne
with
an
affectionate
warmth
in
her
voice
she
is
as
as
a
child
and
besides
had
been
a
great
invalid
she
took
the
whole
course
of
baths
at
saint
sauveur
last
season
and
was
starting
in
again
oh
said
the
man
as
if
surprised
she
had
been
at
saint
sauveur
before
for
the
baths
and
then
as
if
speaking
to
some
one
else
it
would
be
harder
then
to
establish
that
she
was
there
to
meet
the
young
garnier
jeanne
seemed
so
astounded
at
this
idea
that
she
could
scarcely
get
her
breath
to
protest
oh
oh
who
ever
heard
of
anything
so
wild
is
what
people
are
saying
oh
why
she
laughed
out
in
her
amazement
she
hardly
knew
him
by
sight
why
said
the
man
evidently
not
speaking
to
jeanne
did
you
say
that
she
ran
down
along
the
bank
of
the
river
screaming
that
he
had
killed
himself
for
her
sake
yes
i
said
that
answered
another
man
voice
astonished
and
on
the
defense
and
she
too
and
when
the
body
was
pulled
out
she
flung
herself
down
on
it
and
shrieked
that
she
wanted
to
die
with
him
jeanne
broke
in
now
at
the
top
of
her
voice
calling
heaven
and
earth
and
all
the
saints
to
witness
that
she
never
heard
of
anything
so
preposterous
in
her
life
and
that
anybody
in
bayonne
could
tell
them
so
and
what
crazy
stories
would
people
be
making
up
next
out
of
whole
cloth
some
one
is
trying
to
play
a
joke
on
from
saint
sauveur
nobody
have
heard
our
madame
say
such
things
because
she
could
possibly
have
said
them
any
more
than
she
could
about
a
clerk
who
sold
her
a
yard
of
cloth
over
the
counter
for
she
did
know
any
more
about
the
young
man
than
that
why
she
knew
him
except
as
the
son
of
one
of
her
friends
he
never
came
to
the
house
and
more
than
that
she
had
even
laid
eyes
on
him
for
more
than
two
years
he
had
been
in
america
and
is
only
just
returned
day
before
yesterday
you
ask
here
can
tell
you
that
nom
de
dieu
said
the
first
man
voice
in
extreme
surprise
seen
him
for
two
years
no
he
has
even
been
in
france
since
he
was
a
little
young
boy
the
first
man
laughed
as
though
the
joke
were
on
his
comrade
the
second
man
voice
said
still
defending
himself
but
now
uncertainly
very
queer
his
following
her
right
up
there
if
he
scarcely
knew
her
what
was
doing
in
saint
sauveur
at
this
season
i
like
to
know
if
not
oh
as
to
that
said
jeanne
carelessly
i
happen
to
know
why
he
was
there
i
saw
the
young
monsieur
day
before
yesterday
just
as
he
was
about
to
take
the
seven
train
valise
in
hand
and
i
had
a
talk
with
him
our
young
mademoiselle
and
i
why
i
thought
you
hardly
knew
him
by
sight
in
this
house
and
he
never
came
here
broke
in
the
second
policeman
suspiciously
i
did
say
it
was
here
we
saw
him
said
jeanne
and
i
said
it
was
madame
who
hardly
knew
him
but
he
is
the
brother
of
a
little
girl
classmate
of
our
mademoiselle
they
are
all
children
together
well
every
evening
at
six
except
the
days
when
mademoiselle
takes
her
music
lesson
i
go
to
the
school
to
fetch
her
home
and
that
afternoon
as
we
were
coming
up
the
rue
port
neuf
we
met
the
young
man
going
towards
the
station
and
when
he
saw
our
mademoiselle
he
stopped
for
a
moment
for
a
chat
as
young
folks
will
he
was
in
high
good
spirits
and
said
he
was
off
for
a
fine
business
trip
to
the
mountains
and
expected
to
have
a
good
time
as
well
as
do
business
and
would
be
in
cauterets
the
next
morning
well
you
know
cauterets
is
just
over
a
ridge
of
the
pyrenees
from
saint
sauveur
and
mlle
marise
said
is
not
that
queer
my
maman
is
at
saint
sauveur
just
now
why
do
you
take
the
other
train
at
and
run
up
to
saint
sauveur
for
half
a
day
and
take
maman
a
message
from
me
something
i
forgot
to
ask
her
before
she
left
and
the
young
man
said
he
had
been
half
planning
to
go
to
saint
sauveur
on
business
anyhow
and
to
tell
him
the
message
and
if
he
saw
her
maman
he
repeat
it
only
he
said
do
believe
your
maman
knows
me
and
mlle
marise
said
you
tell
her
you
are
big
brother
and
she
know
she
knows
all
about
my
and
the
young
man
asked
which
sanitarium
it
was
in
luz
and
mlle
marise
reminded
him
it
at
saint
sauveur
where
maman
is
and
told
him
the
name
of
the
sanitarium
and
then
he
said
he
hoped
he
get
a
little
fishing
in
the
gavarnie
and
i
said
the
water
would
be
too
high
and
he
said
he
go
and
have
a
look
at
it
anyway
and
then
he
went
along
with
his
valise
mlle
marise
is
at
school
or
you
could
ask
her
all
about
this
too
eh
my
friend
from
saint
sauveur
said
the
first
man
voice
in
a
rallying
tone
of
jocularity
this
sounds
as
though
some
of
you
must
have
lost
your
heads
a
bit
come
now
did
you
yourself
her
saying
all
that
no
of
course
i
did
said
the
other
man
stiffly
i
was
in
the
office
at
luz
how
could
i
know
anything
was
happening
but
the
men
who
got
the
body
out
said
she
was
awful
to
hear
oh
i
do
doubt
agreed
jeanne
that
she
was
any
woman
would
have
been
driven
half
crazy
by
such
an
awful
thing
the
only
son
of
a
friend
killed
before
your
eyes
and
she
is
terribly
nervous
into
the
bargain
the
least
little
thing
sends
her
off
into
hysteria
some
nights
i
have
to
rub
her
back
until
eleven
to
quiet
her
and
the
doctor
has
warned
her
against
the
least
excitement
why
two
days
ago
there
was
an
important
at
our
mademoiselle
school
and
the
poor
woman
although
she
would
have
given
anything
to
go
was
forbidden
by
the
doctor
he
said
the
excitement
would
be
too
much
for
her
and
she
would
feel
it
so
if
her
daughter
were
defeated
you
can
ask
any
one
whether
she
was
there
and
that
evening
although
mlle
marise
had
won
the
prize
she
was
so
worked
up
i
had
to
give
her
a
sleeping
draught
to
get
her
a
little
rest
poor
thing
were
they
of
what
she
said
asked
the
first
man
of
the
other
would
they
swear
to
it
i
do
see
how
anybody
could
hear
anything
put
in
jeanne
in
ordinary
weather
the
gave
of
gavarnie
makes
such
a
noise
down
there
in
that
gorge
you
ca
hear
your
own
voice
even
if
you
yell
i
remember
last
summer
when
madame
was
taking
the
cure
when
we
went
to
see
her
and
now
in
flood
they
certainly
swear
to
her
being
in
a
terrible
state
of
agitation
said
the
other
in
a
rather
nettled
tone
he
went
on
you
saw
for
yourself
what
was
put
in
the
paper
about
it
this
morning
how
they
had
met
there
by
design
and
spent
the
night
together
at
the
hotel
and
all
you
wo
get
far
in
an
inquest
my
young
friend
if
you
take
what
a
newspaper
says
newspapers
are
always
wrong
said
the
first
man
pityingly
in
a
tone
of
experienced
scepticism
if
this
happened
at
ten
in
the
morning
they
ca
have
been
together
more
than
an
hour
if
he
was
seen
here
in
bayonne
at
six
the
evening
before
he
possibly
have
reached
saint
sauveur
before
nine
the
next
morning
you
know
you
wait
three
or
four
hours
for
the
connection
at
lourdes
to
my
mind
there
nothing
in
it
i
will
take
you
to
the
convent
to
see
her
if
you
insist
but
i
have
no
liking
for
scenes
with
hysteric
women
oh
messieurs
said
jeanne
shocked
at
the
idea
you
could
possibly
expect
to
see
her
not
for
a
week
at
least
the
doctor
said
a
cried
the
second
voice
dismayed
sacrebleu
i
ca
kick
my
heels
for
a
week
waiting
well
suppose
we
go
through
the
usual
routine
suggested
the
other
go
to
see
the
family
of
the
young
man
and
if
they
confirm
all
this
there
no
use
going
further
there
is
plenty
of
time
for
you
to
get
all
the
facts
you
need
for
your
report
and
catch
the
one
train
back
to
saint
sauveur
jeanne
said
now
jocularly
with
a
change
of
manner
to
the
intimate
knowing
tone
of
a
speaking
to
a
policeman
if
you
not
in
a
hurry
you
must
stay
to
have
a
glass
in
honor
of
the
house
we
have
an
excellent
white
wine
and
the
patron
never
counts
the
bottles
marise
heard
her
lead
them
down
the
hall
and
across
the
landing
to
the
and
then
in
an
instant
heard
her
come
back
and
run
on
up
the
hall
she
thrust
her
head
through
the
curtains
showing
a
haggard
gray
face
glistening
with
sweat
and
whispered
do
move
do
speak
to
a
soul
till
i
get
back
i
must
see
the
garniers
before
they
do
even
without
this
marise
would
have
been
incapable
of
moving
hand
or
foot
half
an
hour
later
she
was
sitting
in
exactly
the
same
position
frozen
and
deathly
sick
when
jeanne
let
herself
in
cautiously
from
the
gust
of
sounds
that
came
in
from
across
the
landing
as
the
door
was
opened
the
two
policemen
seemed
to
be
greatly
enjoying
both
isabelle
and
the
white
wine
then
jeanne
shut
the
door
on
the
loud
voices
and
laughter
and
in
their
place
marise
heard
the
sound
of
dreadful
hoarse
gasps
as
jeanne
tried
to
get
her
breath
after
running
it
did
not
sound
like
the
breathing
of
a
human
being
but
like
that
of
some
large
animal
like
a
horse
or
cow
exhausted
and
panting
jeanne
came
up
the
hall
fighting
thus
for
her
breath
and
dragging
her
feet
she
shuffled
heavily
into
the
salon
and
across
to
the
closed
curtains
where
locked
in
her
nightmare
the
child
waited
for
some
one
to
come
to
the
rescue
the
old
woman
drew
the
curtain
a
little
aside
marise
caught
one
glimpse
of
her
face
now
swollen
and
darkly
congested
she
saw
that
jeanne
was
nodding
reassuringly
at
her
she
heard
jeanne
say
in
a
whisper
they
understood
it
all
right
they
then
without
the
slightest
warning
she
turned
to
one
side
and
fell
headlong
inside
the
curtains
for
an
instant
she
lay
as
if
dead
her
ghastly
face
at
marise
feet
but
almost
at
once
she
opened
her
eyes
and
tried
to
smile
and
to
speak
only
a
guttural
sound
came
from
her
lips
a
look
of
terrible
anxiety
came
into
her
face
she
motioned
with
one
hand
passionately
that
the
curtain
should
be
drawn
shut
to
conceal
her
marise
frightened
out
of
her
palsy
was
kneeling
by
her
sobbing
jeanne
jeanne
she
thought
of
what
jeanne
had
done
for
her
mother
and
flinging
her
arms
around
her
as
she
lay
she
kissed
her
furiously
the
tears
coming
in
a
flood
and
pouring
down
on
the
dreadful
face
now
strangely
twisted
to
one
side
jeanne
put
one
arm
around
her
and
tried
again
to
say
something
but
her
tongue
moved
senselessly
in
her
distorted
mouth
the
sweat
stood
out
on
her
forehead
as
she
struggled
to
speak
finally
she
gave
up
her
desperate
attempt
and
put
her
finger
to
her
lips
exhorting
marise
to
silence
such
a
wildness
of
apprehension
was
in
her
eyes
that
the
girl
muffled
her
sobs
hiding
her
face
on
the
inert
breast
clinging
with
all
her
might
to
the
body
she
thought
that
jeanne
was
dying
she
thought
that
she
herself
was
dying
she
longed
to
die
there
that
instant
and
escape
the
shame
and
sorrow
and
misery
that
buried
her
so
deep
so
much
deeper
even
than
jeanne
knew
the
sound
of
laughter
and
voices
chimed
out
merrily
again
isabelle
had
opened
the
other
door
marise
held
her
breath
her
face
buried
on
jeanne
breast
the
old
woman
tightened
the
clasp
of
her
arm
they
strained
their
ears
then
they
heard
the
men
feet
clatter
down
the
stairs
chapter
xxi
i
it
was
mlle
hasparren
who
found
them
so
mlle
hasparren
with
her
shabby
coat
buttoned
crookedly
who
ran
up
the
stairs
as
the
sergents
de
ville
went
down
who
came
in
without
a
word
of
explanation
to
take
charge
of
things
she
expressed
no
surprise
at
finding
marise
where
she
was
nor
at
jeanne
condition
she
acted
as
if
nothing
she
found
could
have
surprised
her
she
lifted
marise
up
with
strong
loving
arms
led
her
into
her
own
room
and
made
her
lie
down
with
a
handkerchief
soaked
in
smelling
salts
under
her
nose
and
a
cold
bandage
across
her
forehead
while
isabelle
stayed
with
jeanne
she
did
not
pet
marise
or
kiss
her
but
from
all
her
quiet
presence
breathed
an
assurance
that
she
was
there
to
take
care
of
her
and
when
she
said
i
stay
right
here
dear
till
your
father
comes
marise
fell
into
a
fit
of
quiet
thankful
weeping
that
washed
away
the
nervous
trembling
of
her
hands
and
lips
she
lay
turned
on
her
side
sobbing
the
tears
running
fast
from
her
eyes
and
thought
of
nothing
except
the
steady
look
on
mlle
hasparren
face
now
i
must
leave
you
here
dear
child
i
will
send
isabelle
for
the
doctor
and
i
will
stay
with
jeanne
presently
mlle
hasparren
came
back
and
sat
down
again
by
the
bed
she
looked
perfectly
and
exactly
as
usual
which
gave
marise
the
most
inexpressible
comfort
she
said
that
the
doctor
was
there
had
seen
jeanne
and
that
she
was
not
dying
at
all
not
likely
to
but
had
simply
had
a
partial
stroke
of
paralysis
such
as
often
happened
to
people
of
her
age
nothing
in
the
least
unusual
about
it
jeanne
was
so
old
that
any
little
thing
might
bring
on
a
stroke
of
this
sort
and
she
had
worked
so
valiantly
all
her
life
she
was
really
older
than
her
age
she
and
isabelle
and
the
doctor
had
got
jeanne
undressed
and
in
her
own
bed
and
now
she
would
be
all
right
only
she
had
made
them
understand
that
she
wanted
to
see
marise
the
doctor
had
told
her
that
she
see
any
one
but
she
had
become
so
agitated
that
he
thought
it
best
to
humor
her
only
of
course
poor
thing
she
ca
say
a
word
that
any
one
can
understand
it
just
an
old
woman
whim
marise
thought
to
herself
that
it
might
be
more
than
an
old
woman
whim
and
getting
up
at
once
went
with
mlle
hasparren
into
the
room
where
jeanne
lay
on
the
bed
the
doctor
was
on
one
side
on
the
other
was
isabelle
half
frightened
and
half
delighted
with
the
excitement
a
visit
from
gallant
sergents
de
ville
and
from
the
doctor
all
in
one
day
jeanne
motioned
them
all
out
with
her
one
arm
and
only
when
the
door
had
closed
after
them
did
she
beckon
marise
to
her
she
did
not
try
to
speak
now
she
only
looked
at
the
girl
with
a
terrible
concentration
and
put
her
finger
to
her
lips
do
you
mean
jeanne
whispered
marise
her
lips
trembling
that
i
am
not
to
tell
any
one
jeanne
closed
her
eyes
rapidly
in
assent
oh
no
no
cried
the
poor
child
of
course
not
never
never
never
but
the
old
woman
was
not
satisfied
she
reached
out
for
marise
hand
and
drew
her
close
her
eyes
burning
in
her
disfigured
face
she
struck
her
lips
repeatedly
with
her
fingers
as
though
try
as
she
might
she
could
not
express
the
urgency
of
her
command
no
one
no
one
at
all
asked
marise
and
then
with
a
gasp
not
even
papa
at
this
jeanne
eyes
leaped
up
to
a
hotter
flame
of
intensity
no
no
no
they
cried
to
marise
no
marise
thought
she
understood
and
hanging
her
head
she
said
in
a
low
shamed
voice
oh
no
of
course
i
see
with
the
words
and
the
acceptance
of
their
meaning
which
passionate
eyes
thrust
upon
her
marise
sank
for
many
years
into
another
plane
of
feeling
and
saw
all
the
world
in
another
perspective
very
ugly
and
grim
that
was
the
way
jeanne
saw
things
with
all
her
immature
personality
with
the
pitiably
insufficient
weapons
of
a
little
girl
marise
had
fought
not
to
accept
jeanne
way
of
seeing
things
that
had
been
the
real
cause
of
their
quarrels
but
now
the
weapons
were
struck
from
her
hands
jeanne
had
been
right
all
the
time
it
seemed
that
was
the
way
things
really
were
now
she
knew
with
a
long
breath
she
admitted
her
defeat
no
not
papa
she
whispered
ii
it
was
four
that
afternoon
they
had
had
something
to
eat
talking
quietly
about
indifferent
things
and
they
had
found
address
in
bordeaux
and
sent
a
telegram
to
him
before
marise
thought
to
ask
but
mademoiselle
how
is
it
you
can
be
out
of
your
she
had
often
known
the
teacher
to
drag
herself
to
work
when
she
was
scarcely
able
to
stand
and
knew
how
the
stern
discipline
of
her
profession
frowned
on
an
absence
from
duty
oh
i
arranged
this
morning
to
have
a
substitute
come
i
heard
i
heard
your
maman
was
not
well
and
i
knew
your
papa
was
not
here
and
i
sure
that
any
of
your
maman
friends
might
be
able
to
come
to
look
out
for
you
as
a
matter
of
fact
marise
never
saw
one
of
her
mother
callers
again
that
evening
anna
brought
up
a
blue
telegram
from
papa
which
since
it
had
been
sent
in
english
as
papa
always
insisted
on
doing
was
perfectly
unintelligible

papa
marise
who
had
with
maman
puzzled
over
many
other
similar
telegrams
from
papa
made
out
and
that
was
enough
the
doctor
had
sent
in
a
nursing
sister
to
take
care
of
jeanne
during
the
night
and
isabelle
had
gone
off
to
a
tenement
near
the
porte
where
some
relations
of
hers
lived
and
had
brought
back
an
old
cousin
to
help
her
with
the
work
and
marketing
and
to
sleep
with
her
in
the
other
apartment
mlle
hasparren
slept
in
the
beside
marise
so
that
every
time
marise
with
a
great
scared
start
realized
anew
that
what
had
happened
was
not
a
bad
dream
she
felt
the
other
hand
reaching
for
hers
in
the
dark
and
holding
firm
she
said
very
little
and
marise
was
glad
of
that
but
the
clasp
of
her
muscular
musician
hand
pulled
marise
out
of
the
black
pit
many
times
that
night
later
on
marise
fell
into
a
real
sleep
deep
and
unbroken
and
when
she
woke
up
much
later
than
usual
to
find
mlle
hasparren
all
dressed
the
put
away
the
window
open
and
the
sunshine
coming
in
she
found
that
she
seemed
to
have
grown
stronger
since
yesterday
that
the
black
pit
was
not
so
fathomless
she
felt
infinitely
older
and
as
though
she
would
never
laugh
again
she
lay
in
bed
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
thinking
fixedly
about
what
had
happened
and
found
that
she
could
endure
it
now
without
crying
out
or
bursting
into
tears
as
she
had
done
yesterday
she
could
stand
up
under
her
burden
because
there
was
no
other
way
but
she
felt
her
shoulders
bowed
and
aching
with
the
weight
mlle
hasparren
heard
her
stir
in
bed
and
sensed
the
awakened
quality
of
the
movement
she
came
to
look
anxiously
down
at
her
marise
looked
back
and
remembering
that
so
far
as
she
knew
mlle
hasparren
knew
nothing
beyond
the
surface
of
the
happenings
of
yesterday
and
so
might
expect
her
to
be
able
to
smile
she
produced
a
faint
smile
i
overslept
she
said
in
order
to
say
something
has
somebody
brought
your
breakfast
no
i
waited
for
you
answered
mlle
hasparren
i
ring
for
isabelle
now
when
isabelle
came
very
at
taking
jeanne
place
she
reported
that
the
sister
said
jeanne
had
passed
a
very
good
night
and
was
perfectly
comfortable
with
no
complications
she
says
jeanne
may
get
all
over
it
and
be
as
good
as
ever
all
old
people
have
these
seizures
she
says
chattered
isabelle
setting
down
the
tray
and
pouring
out
marise
she
was
full
of
her
new
dignity
and
bustled
off
to
give
orders
to
her
assistant
leaving
marise
and
mlle
hasparren
to
eat
their
breakfast
mlle
hasparren
did
not
seem
to
feel
like
talking
much
and
neither
did
marise
she
was
trying
to
think
what
it
was
she
was
to
tell
papa
she
must
remember
now
just
what
it
was
that
everybody
was
to
be
told
an
hour
later
as
they
went
down
the
hall
on
their
way
to
the
station
to
meet
the
morning
train
they
saw
the
salon
as
usual
at
that
hour
the
chairs
pushed
about
the
rugs
hanging
over
the
the
fresh
clean
new
morning
sun
streaming
in
through
the
windows
on
the
familiar
spectacle
of
isabelle
on
her
knees
a
in
her
hand
reaching
under
the
piano
for
dust
the
alcove
curtains
were
drawn
back
the
cheerful
sunshine
poured
in
glittering
on
the
dark
polished
wood
of
the
desk
on
the
books
on
the
pretty
little
inlaid
chair
which
stood
beside
the
desk
was
it
only
yesterday
that
jeanne
had
flung
her
into
that
chair
she
stood
in
the
door
as
she
put
on
her
hat
looking
steadily
at
the
alcove
no
that
had
been
somebody
else
a
little
girl
a
lucky
lucky
little
girl
who
had
no
idea
what
things
were
like
come
dear
said
mlle
hasparren
looking
at
her
watch
it
had
been
agreed
since
there
were
so
few
trains
in
and
out
of
bayonne
and
since
as
yet
no
news
had
been
sent
to
jeanne
family
that
if
marise
father
did
come
on
the
train
from
the
north
mlle
hasparren
would
board
it
as
he
left
it
and
go
on
down
to
midassoa
to
tell
the
amigorenas
about
their
mother
illness
but
do
tell
them
mademoiselle
marise
said
over
and
over
anxiously
that
we
will
take
care
of
jeanne
that
we
will
do
everything
for
her
that
anybody
could
that
they
need
worry
i
know
papa
will
see
that
she
taken
care
of
i
he
will
if
i
ask
him
but
really
she
was
not
as
sure
as
she
said
she
did
not
know
papa
so
very
well
after
all
she
had
very
little
idea
what
he
would
feel
or
say
about
anything
and
then
everything
depended
on
the
way
things
turned
out
they
stood
there
in
the
smoky
dusk
of
the
station
a
long
ray
of
sunshine
thick
with
golden
motes
striking
the
ground
at
their
feet
they
still
said
very
little
marise
not
daring
to
talk
for
fear
of
making
a
mistake
for
fear
that
she
would
not
remember
just
what
and
how
much
mlle
hasparren
knew
the
held
the
girl
slim
fingers
close
marise
answered
their
pressure
with
a
nervous
fervor
inexpressibly
grateful
to
the
other
loving
everything
about
her
from
her
steady
face
and
kind
shadowed
eyes
to
her
heavy
shoes
dusty
now
which
would
be
dustier
later
after
they
had
trudged
along
the
hot
white
road
at
midassoa
never
so
long
as
she
lived
was
she
able
to
forget
how
mlle
hasparren
had
looked
to
her
when
she
came
quietly
into
the
salon
and
lifted
her
up
from
jeanne
and
said
in
a
plain
way
as
though
nothing
were
the
matter
but
sickness
that
they
must
get
a
doctor
and
probably
jeanne
was
as
sick
as
she
looked
she
had
just
taken
marise
by
the
hand
and
showed
her
how
to
go
on
living
when
it
seemed
to
marise
that
she
had
come
to
the
end
they
heard
the
train
whistle
shriekingly
in
the
distance
and
the
somnolent
porters
roused
themselves
marise
tightened
her
hold
on
the
strong
fingers
which
held
hers
her
heart
ached
with
longing
with
confusion
suppose
papa
did
not
come
what
she
do
but
suppose
he
did
would
it
be
impossible
not
to
make
mistakes
not
to
forget
what
you
were
to
say
and
what
you
were
but
when
the
train
came
in
and
marise
saw
at
the
other
end
of
the
long
platform
her
father
massive
bulk
heavily
descending
from
a
compartment
and
saw
his
eyes
begin
to
search
the
crowd
for
her
face
all
her
confusion
melted
away
in
a
great
burst
of
relief
papa
was
there
something
of
her
very
own
in
the
midst
of
all
those
strangers
her
heart
almost
broke
with
its
release
from
tension
and
yet
before
she
ran
to
meet
him
she
put
her
arms
around
the
and
kissed
her
hard
on
both
swarthy
cheeks
iii
then
she
ran
with
all
the
speed
of
her
long
legs
and
flung
herself
upon
papa
broad
chest
and
tried
to
put
her
arms
around
him
as
she
had
around
mile
hasparren
and
began
to
cry
on
papa
great
shoulder
how
good
it
was
to
feel
him
to
feel
him
so
entirely
as
papa
always
felt
it
would
not
have
seemed
like
papa
if
there
were
not
more
of
him
than
she
could
get
her
arms
around
her
tears
her
agitation
gave
papa
such
a
turn
that
he
set
his
satchels
down
hastily
and
looking
alarmed
shook
her
a
little
and
asked
what
had
happened
to
maman
in
the
hurry
and
noise
and
bustle
of
the
crowd
it
was
easier
than
marise
had
feared
to
get
over
that
first
moment
when
papa
must
be
told
it
all
came
out
straight
just
what
she
had
planned
to
tell
him
that
nothing
had
really
happened
to
maman
she
was
sick
or
anything
only
she
had
had
a
terrible
nervous
shock
had
seen
somebody
killed
right
before
her
eyes
and
it
had
pretty
nearly
driven
her
wild
oh
said
papa
evidently
relieved
and
caring
as
little
as
marise
had
about
the
person
who
had
been
killed
he
picked
up
his
satchels
again
by
this
time
the
porters
at
the
bayonne
station
were
resigned
to
his
strange
mania
for
carrying
his
own
and
said
well
yes
that
too
bad
i
remember
i
saw
a
brakeman
killed
once
and
it
made
me
pretty
sick
too
they
walked
out
of
the
station
together
not
two
minutes
had
passed
since
his
arrival
and
already
marise
joy
that
he
had
come
had
faded
to
a
frightened
sense
that
he
had
not
come
at
all
that
he
was
still
very
far
away
that
he
would
never
really
come
as
he
used
to
and
yet
jeanne
had
been
right
of
course
whatever
else
she
did
she
must
not
tell
papa
when
did
it
happen
asked
papa
now
as
they
turned
the
corner
and
were
finally
escaped
from
the
last
of
the
clamorous
who
had
not
yet
accepted
as
the
porters
had
the
eccentricities
of
the
american
gentleman
as
they
crossed
the
bridge
marise
told
him
the
version
she
had
prepared
the
version
jeanne
had
presented
she
had
had
a
good
deal
of
practice
in
saying
something
different
from
what
she
thought
and
she
got
through
this
without
any
hesitation
or
mistake
but
every
word
of
it
set
her
further
away
from
papa
raised
a
wall
between
them
the
wall
of
things
she
knew
and
papa
must
never
know
well
to
be
sure
said
papa
when
she
finished
you
certainly
have
had
for
sure
oh
papa
went
on
marise
earnestly
you
have
jeanne
taken
care
of
it
was
when
she
was
working
for
us
she
got
her
paralysis
you
feel
we
ought
to
for
always
for
always
it
was
for
us
oh
as
to
that
said
papa
anybody
of
jeanne
age
who
rustles
around
as
jeanne
does
is
apt
to
get
a
stroke
whether
she
was
working
for
us
or
not
it
might
have
happened
just
as
easily
in
her
own
home
marise
heart
went
down
papa
added
with
a
change
of
tone
i
do
like
her
lying
very
well
but
the
old
woman
has
been
awfully
good
to
you
molly
awfully
good
more
like
your
grandmother
than
the
cook
and
i
guess
we
see
that
she
taken
care
of
all
right
marise
squeezed
his
arm
hard
and
said
nothing
after
all
wall
or
no
wall
papa
was
there
good
old
papa
so
broad
and
solid
her
very
own
papa
somebody
who
even
if
he
did
understand
much
of
what
went
on
would
look
out
for
them
all
maman
jeanne
herself
iv
papa
went
in
at
once
to
see
jeanne
and
told
her
through
marise
for
jeanne
had
never
learned
to
understand
his
brand
of
french
that
he
would
see
that
she
was
well
taken
care
of
till
she
recovered
jeanne
contrived
with
her
one
living
hand
and
her
eyes
to
convey
her
respectful
thanks
and
to
conceal
everything
else
which
marise
knew
she
must
be
thinking
then
papa
wanted
to
go
at
once
to
the
convent
and
bring
maman
home
what
had
he
come
back
for
if
not
for
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
marise
was
not
very
sure
why
he
had
come
back
or
why
she
had
felt
it
so
necessary
to
get
word
to
him
at
once
now
that
she
had
had
time
to
think
about
it
she
realized
that
she
dreaded
very
much
having
maman
see
papa
just
now
right
after
after
all
that
it
would
have
been
better
for
her
to
have
had
a
little
time
to
get
over
it
and
like
marise
to
think
what
to
say
but
of
course
this
was
one
of
the
things
she
could
not
speak
to
papa
about
all
she
could
do
was
to
find
out
that
lunch
was
nearly
ready
and
they
would
better
eat
that
before
they
went
to
the
convent
isabelle
her
head
turned
with
the
sudden
removal
of
authority
had
prepared
a
gala
luncheon
with
the
best
silver
and
linen
and
what
a
pretty
bunch
of
flowers
remarked
papa
marise
looked
silently
at
the
white
now
opening
into
roses
was
it
only
yesterday
morning
that
jeanne
had
given
her
those
was
it
only
two
days
before
that
she
had
been
walking
along
with
the
garniers
with
nothing
in
her
head
but
mockery
of
madame
garnier
shoes
and
hat
no
that
must
have
been
somebody
else
some
one
she
had
distantly
known
that
girl
who
had
laughed
with
the
others
so
over
their
foolishness
behind
the
scenes
let
me
see
remarked
papa
you
must
be
almost
fifteen
are
you
molly
yesterday
was
my
birthday
funny
kind
of
celebration
marise
looked
at
him
across
an
immense
chasm
and
said
nothing
she
could
ever
remember
having
a
meal
at
a
table
alone
with
papa
before
do
you
want
to
go
with
me
he
asked
later
as
the
dessert
was
served
i
do
know
how
to
find
my
way
around
a
convent
of
all
places
whatever
possessed
your
mama
to
go
there
anyhow
she
and
soeur
ste
lucie
are
such
good
friends
explained
marise
she
decided
not
to
say
anything
about
the
old
monk
because
she
did
know
whether
papa
knew
about
maman
going
to
see
him
before
but
after
thinking
for
an
instant
she
decided
that
it
would
do
no
harm
to
add
soeur
ste
lucie
wants
mama
to
be
a
catholic
you
know
papa
said
quickly
what
that
marise
was
surprised
at
his
tone
perhaps
that
one
of
the
things
she
ought
to
tell
about
why
would
you
mind
if
she
did
she
asked
papa
thought
for
a
moment
and
dropped
back
into
his
usual
slow
casual
comment
oh
no
i
guess
not
if
she
wants
to
there
was
a
silence
broken
by
papa
saying
something
else
in
an
earnest
tone
as
though
this
time
he
really
wanted
marise
to
listen
to
him
all
i
want
molly
is
for
mama
to
have
things
the
way
she
wants
them
marise
heart
was
nervously
sensitive
that
day
in
a
sick
responsiveness
to
the
faintest
indication
of
what
was
in
other
hearts
she
could
not
put
another
morsel
of
food
to
her
lips
she
sat
looking
down
at
her
plate
trying
to
master
or
at
least
understand
the
surge
of
feeling
within
her
i
ever
want
is
for
mama
to
have
things
the
way
she
wants
there
was
so
much
to
think
of
in
that
that
she
was
still
lost
in
thinking
when
papa
pushed
back
his
chair
and
got
up
pulling
down
his
vest
with
his
usual
gesture
i
have
a
look
at
the
mail
while
you
get
your
things
on
he
suggested
evidently
he
was
still
set
on
going
at
once
to
see
maman
perhaps
more
than
he
admitted
he
really
did
like
her
being
in
a
convent
marise
went
to
get
her
hat
and
with
it
in
her
hand
went
to
join
her
father
standing
by
her
mother
in
the
alcove
he
had
an
american
newspaper
in
his
hand
his
inserted
in
the
wrapper
he
tore
it
open
and
stood
looking
at
the
headlines
while
marise
put
on
her
and
tilting
her
head
forward
slipped
the
rubber
under
her
hair
behind
all
ready
said
papa
and
they
set
out
how
much
less
everything
was
now
that
papa
was
home
but
would
it
be
if
he
but
he
never
would
who
would
tell
him
not
maman
certainly
although
marise
wished
that
poor
maman
could
have
had
a
few
days
more
without
seeing
papa
to
get
over
being
excited
so
she
could
be
surer
of
what
she
was
saying
not
jeanne
not
herself
nobody
else
knew
him
well
enough
to
tell
him
anything
if
maman
could
only
get
through
all
right
v
at
the
convent
they
waited
in
the
usual
bare
convent
parlor
with
the
shutters
drawn
with
the
usual
little
chairs
so
light
that
the
one
papa
sat
down
on
groaned
and
creaked
under
his
great
weight
the
usual
displayed
the
usual
lives
of
the
saints
through
an
open
door
they
could
look
down
a
long
long
gray
stone
corridor
very
empty
till
they
saw
soeur
ste
lucie
hurrying
noiselessly
down
it
towards
them
as
she
came
near
marise
saw
that
her
sweet
face
looked
anxious
and
worried
she
told
them
at
once
that
madame
allen
had
been
taken
very
ill
that
they
had
been
up
all
night
with
her
and
had
sent
for
the
doctor
early
that
morning
papa
was
startled
by
this
unexpected
news
and
apparently
never
dreamed
of
what
occurred
to
marise
at
once
that
this
was
just
something
they
had
made
up
to
prevent
anybody
talking
to
her
marise
thought
it
a
good
idea
she
had
hoped
something
like
that
could
be
arranged
in
case
those
horrible
sergents
de
ville
came
back
again
she
was
not
alarmed
by
soeur
ste
lucie
worried
face
because
this
was
by
no
means
the
first
time
that
she
had
observed
how
easy
it
was
for
people
faces
to
look
anything
they
wished
to
have
them
papa
was
asking
rather
sharply
what
is
the
matter
what
did
the
doctor
say
is
it
the
effect
of
nervous
shock
all
the
same
it
was
too
bad
thought
marise
to
have
papa
worried
for
nothing
soeur
ste
lucie
shook
her
head
hurriedly
oh
no
something
much
more
acute
than
that
a
terrible
terrible
chill
which
has
gone
to
her
lungs
the
poor
lady
must
have
been
in
soaking
wet
clothes
for
nobody
knows
how
long
monsieur
has
been
told
of
the
she
hesitated
and
paused
yes
yes
i
know
she
was
with
some
one
who
fell
into
a
river
somewhere
and
was
drowned
but
did
she
fall
in
too
how
did
she
get
wet
why
her
clothes
changed
his
voice
rose
as
he
asked
the
questions
soeur
ste
lucie
explained
in
a
low
hurried
agitated
voice
nobody
knows
of
course
just
what
happened
perhaps
she
tried
to
save
the
poor
fellow
perhaps
she
slipped
as
he
did
in
any
case
she
was
too
distraught
to
think
of
herself
or
to
realize
the
danger
of
going
so
long
in
wet
clothes
and
every
one
there
was
so
absorbed
in
the
tragedy
she
was
all
alone
among
strangers
the
poor
lady
she
must
have
sat
in
her
dripping
garments
in
the
cold
train
all
the
way
to
lourdes
and
then
half
the
night
in
the
unheated
station
there
waiting
for
the
train
it
was
terrible
the
doctor
said
it
was
terrible
to
think
of
weakened
with
the
shock
as
she
was
and
no
food
papa
now
said
ungently
and
impatiently
yet
as
though
he
were
restraining
himself
well
we
must
get
her
home
at
once
where
we
can
take
care
of
her
marise
could
see
that
he
believed
every
word
that
soeur
ste
lucie
said
but
of
course
soeur
ste
lucie
had
the
least
intention
of
letting
papa
take
maman
away
i
afraid
that
is
impossible
she
said
the
doctor
came
back
this
afternoon
is
here
now
in
fact
and
says
her
voice
broke
he
says
she
is
much
too
ill
to
be
moved
at
this
papa
burst
out
angrily
his
face
very
red
why
under
the
heavens
did
you
send
word
of
this
to
her
own
home
here
i
have
been
there
ever
since
the
morning
train
eating
my
lunch
with
no
that
the
nun
defended
herself
reasonably
sadly
showing
no
resentment
at
his
anger
no
one
knew
you
were
come
back
monsieur
and
i
was
just
starting
to
fetch
our
dear
little
marie
marise
saw
over
the
nun
shoulder
a
gentleman
with
a
bald
head
a
great
brown
beard
and
very
white
hands
coming
down
the
corridor
here
is
the
doctor
now
said
soeur
ste
lucie
drawing
in
her
breath
quickly
taking
papa
and
motioning
marise
to
stay
where
she
was
she
stepped
down
the
corridor
marise
watched
them
her
eyes
on
the
doctor
serious
spectacled
eyes
something
about
the
way
he
looked
at
papa
made
marise
for
the
first
time
wonder
if
maman
really
were
a
little
sick
after
all
they
all
came
back
to
where
marise
stood
papa
face
was
no
longer
red
he
said
to
marise
in
a
queer
voice
the
doctor
says
that
maman
must
not
be
disturbed
but
we
may
go
in
to
see
her
for
a
moment
if
we
will
be
quiet
and
not
talk
they
turned
all
of
them
and
started
down
the
long
gray
stone
corridor
marise
along
beside
her
father
she
was
a
little
frightened
in
spite
of
herself
at
a
loss
to
know
what
to
think
or
feel
or
believe
the
emptiness
of
the
corridor
echoed
around
them
ears
rang
with
the
emptiness
of
it
and
how
long
it
was
it
took
them
forever
to
walk
through
it
marise
looked
up
at
the
small
windows
set
high
in
the
wall
and
wondered
when
they
would
ever
come
to
a
door
that
opened
out
but
the
only
door
was
at
the
very
end
and
that
opened
into
the
room
where
maman
lay
in
a
narrow
bed
as
soon
as
she
saw
her
mother
marise
was
sure
again
that
she
was
not
really
sick
because
she
looked
even
better
than
usual
with
a
deep
in
her
cheeks
she
did
seem
a
little
tired
and
sleepy
however
for
her
eyelids
looked
heavy
and
kept
dropping
down
over
her
eyes
they
stood
there
for
a
moment
looking
at
her
till
she
should
open
them
again
when
she
did
and
saw
papa
there
she
flung
out
her
arms
towards
him
as
he
stooped
over
her
she
clung
to
him
with
all
her
might
just
as
marise
had
at
the
station
she
did
not
look
at
marise
at
all
only
at
papa
he
patted
her
shoulder
and
smiled
at
her
and
marise
saw
the
tears
run
out
of
maman
eyes
in
a
gush
papa
sat
down
on
the
little
chair
by
the
bed
which
creaked
under
his
weight
and
leaned
forward
his
arms
around
maman
his
cheek
against
hers
she
said
to
him
in
a
hurried
frightened
whisper
horace
i
want
to
go
home
i
want
to
go
home
he
answered
steadily
it
all
right
flora
we
have
you
home
in
a
few
days
she
closed
her
eyes
again
all
the
expression
dropping
out
of
her
face
the
doctor
stepped
to
the
other
side
of
the
bed
and
his
fingers
on
her
wrist
his
eyes
on
his
watch
motioned
them
silently
to
leave
with
a
sideways
jerk
of
his
head
they
out
and
down
the
long
gray
empty
corridor
marise
mother
died
that
night
without
seeing
them
again
education
in
the
humanities
and
the
liberal
chapter
xxii
september
the
first
weeks
of
freshman
year
were
like
a
return
to
the
formless
impersonality
of
little
boyhood
just
as
neale
had
felt
himself
an
cell
among
the
finished
adults
of
his
parents
circle
so
he
was
now
again
only
one
more
wriggle
in
the
mass
of
freshmen
nobody
could
tell
him
apart
from
any
other
freshman
he
could
scarcely
tell
himself
apart
from
the
other
freshmen
this
did
not
afflict
him
as
it
might
a
more
sensitive
boy
indeed
he
rather
enjoyed
the
anonymity
of
his
condition
the
space
and
vacuum
about
him
which
it
created
where
he
floated
free
from
any
threat
of
the
handling
or
which
was
his
especial
fear
when
he
entered
into
relations
with
other
people
there
was
so
much
that
was
new
to
him
in
college
life
that
it
was
occupation
enough
to
look
on
without
taking
any
part
he
enjoyed
the
variety
of
his
experiences
from
the
feeling
that
came
with
walking
up
the
library
steps
to
the
enchantment
of
floating
on
the
shimmering
water
of
the
swimming
pool
and
he
enjoyed
most
of
all
his
aloof
spectator
scorn
of
footless
classes
like
rhetoric
a
or
where
a
few
ran
the
show
while
the
real
scouts
like
himself
preserved
a
cautious
sardonic
silence
he
discovered
the
perilous
secret
always
a
temptation
to
natures
like
his
that
if
you
attempt
nothing
share
in
no
effort
you
are
automatically
freed
from
any
blame
for
the
inevitable
foolishness
and
blunders
you
can
stand
on
your
safe
little
hillock
and
scorn
the
poor
fools
who
try
to
do
things
and
fail
the
motive
sang
seductively
in
his
ears
nothing
in
any
of
his
classes
nothing
in
the
library
or
in
any
of
the
books
in
it
gave
the
a
hint
of
any
valid
compelling
reason
for
his
assuming
the
heavy
distasteful
burden
of
responsibility
then
one
day
word
was
passed
around
that
the
flag
rush
would
be
held
that
afternoon
the
flag
rush
unanimously
deplored
by
the
directing
forces
of
the
university
the
flag
rush
that
of
meaningless
brutality
so
shocking
to
all
the
european
members
of
the
faculty
secretly
contemptuous
of
the
prosperous
illiterate
childish
country
where
they
taught
neale
never
dreamed
of
staying
out
of
the
flag
rush
there
was
a
row
on
and
his
class
needed
his
muscles
and
his
head
he
went
to
the
gym
at
the
appointed
hour
where
all
the
freshmen
were
assembled
gathering
confidence
at
being
all
together
for
once
they
marched
in
a
body
over
to
south
field
there
they
found
the
sophs
gathered
about
a
tree
from
a
branch
of
which
fluttered
a
flag
juniors
took
charge
of
the
affair
coaching
and
urging
on
the
freshmen
still
buoyed
up
by
their
mass
by
being
together
they
advanced
to
the
charge
they
were
uncertain
and
for
the
most
part
amiable
big
little
boys
who
really
cared
nothing
about
that
flag
who
really
cared
only
about
doing
what
was
expected
of
them
as
they
advanced
they
began
to
hurry
to
rush
forward
nervously
several
detached
sophs
dived
in
at
the
leaders
feet
and
broke
up
the
formation
but
there
was
mass
impetus
enough
to
carry
the
rush
forward
the
freshmen
crashed
into
the
defenders
of
the
flag
pushed
them
back
circled
them
round
at
the
first
physical
contact
with
the
enemy
they
were
no
longer
big
little
boys
doing
what
was
expected
of
them
they
were
young
berserk
fighters
blind
and
furious
with
the
delight
of
battle
a
roar
went
up
a
roar
from
their
very
hearts
like
the
yell
which
had
burst
up
from
their
except
for
a
few
rare
and
artistic
natures
who
were
suffering
horribly
from
shock
every
one
of
them
was
twice
what
he
had
been
two
minutes
before
a
freshman
somehow
shot
up
through
the
crowd
hoisted
on
his
classmates
shoulders
and
laid
his
hands
on
the
sacred
branch
but
defenders
spouted
up
around
him
grabbed
his
legs
and
pulled
him
down
with
this
all
semblance
of
organized
purpose
left
the
rush
it
broke
up
into
a
disorganized
mêlée
rolling
and
tumbling
panting
and
struggling
in
a
hundred
separate
encounters
neale
rolled
and
tumbled
panted
and
struggled
with
the
rest
far
far
from
any
cool
olympian
detachment
he
was
one
of
the
biggest
and
strongest
of
the
freshmen
and
felt
his
responsibility
he
did
what
he
could
but
that
was
not
much
the
freshmen
did
not
know
one
another
and
had
no
plan
sometimes
neale
collared
his
own
classmates
by
mistake
sometimes
a
couple
of
sophs
tackled
him
together
ran
him
back
and
dropped
him
on
the
grass
a
later
the
flag
was
still
in
the
tree
and
the
furious
boiling
over
of
insensate
young
life
had
cooled
to
a
simmer
the
juniors
called
the
rush
off
the
freshmen
began
to
stream
back
to
the
gym
neale
was
surprised
to
find
one
sleeve
to
his
jersey
missing
and
innumerable
rips
and
tears
all
over
his
other
garments
he
was
bruised
from
head
to
foot
and
spat
blood
from
a
cut
lip
calmed
appeased
exhausted
he
made
limping
for
the
gate
as
he
passed
through
it
he
passed
through
another
and
invisible
gate
opening
into
quite
a
different
path
from
the
solitary
way
of
aloofness
which
he
had
been
following
he
did
not
as
a
matter
of
fact
pass
through
the
invisible
gate
he
was
shoved
through
by
a
vigorous
hand
that
slapped
him
on
the
shoulder
turning
neale
looked
into
the
masterful
face
of
the
varsity
coach
report
for
football
practice
was
the
order
i
andrews
the
information
was
unnecessary
neale
would
not
at
this
date
have
recognized
president
low
or
dean
van
amringe
but
he
knew
the
football
coach
the
next
twenty
hours
were
beatific
his
mind
refused
to
grasp
facts
it
wandered
off
into
gorgeous
he
was
on
the
varsity
no
he
was
a
sub
called
in
at
the
last
minute
a
long
run
better
a
recovered
fumble
then
down
the
field
shaking
off
one
tackler
after
another
he
would
wake
up
to
real
life
blushing
swearing
at
himself
for
a
condemned
fool
and
yet
a
few
minutes
later
in
fancy
he
was
the
last
defender
between
the
goal
line
and
a
rushing
yale
back
not
the
faintest
hint
of
any
of
this
appeared
on
the
surface
at
home
he
preserved
his
normal
appetite
which
was
his
mother
gauge
for
his
health
and
spirits
and
although
he
told
them
not
unwillingly
about
the
flag
rush
he
preserved
the
sacred
secret
of
his
summons
from
andrews
as
though
it
had
been
his
first
sentimental
rendezvous
the
next
day
dragged
endlessly
filled
with
the
silhouettes
of
talking
professors
but
three
was
finally
there
and
he
was
at
the
silent
his
face
composed
his
heart
given
to
sudden
swelling
bulges
which
made
it
hard
for
him
to
hear
what
was
being
said
they
gave
him
a
suit
he
trotted
with
the
squad
the
over
to
south
field
ever
played
asked
the
scrub
quarter
yes
said
neale
he
did
not
feel
obliged
to
tell
how
little
what
position
he
lied
brazenly
having
made
up
his
mind
that
he
the
weight
to
aspire
to
the
varsity
line
they
ran
through
signals
then
a
scrimmage
started
but
neale
was
not
in
the
a
scrub
back
had
his
wind
knocked
out
and
did
get
up
quickly
enough
for
the
coach
put
in
that
freshman
jump
in
what
your
name
neale
jumped
and
floundered
for
five
minutes
then
the
peppery
scrub
quarter
consigned
him
profanely
to
the
for
two
days
after
that
he
moped
without
a
job
although
still
in
a
suit
out
in
the
field
then
he
had
another
trial
gradually
he
made
sure
of
his
place
as
on
the
scrub
not
that
he
was
any
good
as
they
told
him
plainly
but
because
in
those
days
the
whole
squad
including
hopeless
dubs
seldom
numbered
over
thirty
men
and
thanks
to
the
work
in
the
mill
at
west
adams
neale
was
physically
fit
with
this
place
minor
though
it
was
came
the
great
privilege
of
dinner
after
practice
at
the
football
house
there
he
picked
up
a
little
of
the
theory
of
the
game
from
the
blackboard
talks
there
after
the
pennsylvania
had
battered
through
for
thirty
points
he
heard
the
coach
white
and
shaking
with
emotion
pour
out
his
biting
you
jackson
shaking
his
at
the
did
you
shoot
your
body
in
low
and
spill
them
in
their
own
territory
no
you
stood
up
neale
flesh
crept
he
was
almost
glad
that
he
had
escaped
the
fearful
responsibility
of
being
on
the
varsity
it
was
terrible
such
a
weight
on
your
shoulders
he
shrank
from
it
and
with
all
his
being
aspired
to
it
he
made
no
impression
on
the
football
world
but
his
own
interior
world
was
transformed
he
was
no
longer
an
isolated
formless
freshman
dumped
down
into
the
midst
of
the
most
callously
of
universities
he
was
no
more
a
forgotten
molecule
with
no
share
in
or
responsibility
for
the
ultimate
reaction
he
had
a
shelter
for
his
personality
against
the
vast
daunting
indifference
of
the
universe
he
was
on
the
football
squad
he
had
feared
he
might
have
some
trouble
in
explaining
his
absence
from
the
at
home
but
that
proved
unexpectedly
easy
the
second
evening
after
he
began
to
play
on
the
scrub
he
found
father
in
the
library
at
home
reading
the
sporting
sheet
of
the
evening
telegram
any
other
crittendens
in
college
neale
he
asked
not
that
i
know
about
that
you
on
the
football
team
then
only
on
the
scrub
yes
i
trying
we
have
dinner
together
after
practice
you
do
mind
do
you
me
of
course
not
said
father
mother
heard
all
this
apparently
had
known
it
before
and
did
not
ask
him
to
take
care
of
himself
and
not
get
hurt
neale
looked
over
at
her
gratefully
mother
was
all
right
the
football
season
slid
along
the
varsity
improving
every
week
neale
glowed
with
as
saturday
after
saturday
he
watched
the
prowess
of
his
big
brothers
every
day
he
felt
himself
stretching
up
broadening
out
nearer
to
their
stature
though
nobody
else
gave
him
a
thought
life
was
full
of
big
and
generous
and
absorbing
matter
then
came
thanksgiving
day
the
climax
and
oh
after
that
what
a
vacuum
nothing
in
life
but
classes
holy
smoke
it
was
fierce
what
did
the
fellows
do
who
had
had
anything
but
classes
how
could
they
stand
it
but
of
course
it
was
such
a
for
them
going
home
as
neale
did
every
afternoon
he
had
none
of
the
scanty
college
social
life
sliding
into
college
as
he
had
with
no
introduction
from
the
right
kind
of
prep
school
and
with
a
noticeably
colorless
personality
he
was
not
thought
of
as
a
possibility
for
any
fraternity
time
hung
heavy
on
his
hands
lectures
took
up
but
three
hours
a
day
on
the
busiest
days
to
fill
in
the
rest
of
the
time
there
was
the
swimming
pool
the
gymnasium
and
the
library
he
swam
practised
the
overhand
racing
stroke
dived
in
the
gym
he
fooled
awkwardly
on
the
parallel
bars
and
he
tossed
medicine
balls
with
any
acquaintance
what
he
really
enjoyed
was
the
line
of
traveling
rings
which
hung
in
front
of
the
visitors
gallery
but
one
day
he
heard
an
upper
classman
refer
to
these
as
freshmen
delight
and
thereafter
he
avoided
them
the
library
the
first
one
to
which
he
had
had
access
was
so
bad
neale
went
there
first
to
look
up
a
reference
for
comp
lit
a
of
course
you
ran
the
risk
of
being
thought
a
grind
if
you
spent
too
much
time
there
but
you
could
kill
the
hours
very
pleasantly
with
the
bound
volumes
of
the
magazines
in
the
shelves
about
the
general
neale
and
most
of
his
friends
wasted
an
unconscionable
number
of
hours
on
those
magazines
but
little
by
little
the
library
habit
began
to
form
itself
by
slow
infinitesimal
accretions
he
found
it
a
good
place
to
study
wrote
english
themes
there
finally
even
got
into
the
way
of
running
through
the
card
catalogue
and
drawing
books
with
titles
that
sounded
good
christmas
came
father
recognizing
manhood
achieved
gave
him
a
box
of
a
hundred
milo
cigarettes
mother
poor
dear
ignorant
mother
gave
him
a
white
sweater
decorated
with
a
light
blue
c
even
more
than
by
smoking
father
cigarettes
neale
proved
that
he
had
begun
to
outgrow
the
cruel
egotism
of
adolescence
by
kissing
mother
and
thanking
her
without
telling
her
that
almost
any
fool
finally
gets
his
diploma
but
only
the
chosen
few
and
these
as
juniors
or
seniors
win
the
right
to
adorn
themselves
with
the
proud
insignia
of
their
varsity
letter
after
christmas
came
the
exams
neale
went
into
them
confidently
enough
and
to
his
astonishment
emerged
with
passing
marks
but
with
no
great
credit
d
in
german
was
the
worst
and
he
studied
german
since
he
was
a
little
boy
greek
english
and
latin
marked
him
as
mediocre
with
a
comparative
literature
alone
rated
him
b
and
every
one
knew
that
comp
lit
was
a
snap
course
neale
had
never
thought
of
himself
as
a
grind
but
he
had
been
used
to
high
marks
at
school
and
the
low
grades
nettled
him
he
began
to
see
that
there
was
more
to
this
college
work
than
he
had
understood
the
studies
themselves
were
not
unlike
those
of
high
school
indeed
they
were
easier
than
the
science
and
mathematics
that
had
been
hammered
into
him
at
hadley
but
the
point
of
view
was
different
and
that
had
fooled
him
there
was
a
take
it
or
leave
it
attitude
about
everything
at
college
the
professors
did
not
as
at
hadley
hold
their
jobs
only
because
they
were
able
to
drive
the
bright
the
dull
the
the
sluggish
all
through
passing
grades
for
the
next
year
work
no
these
college
professors
and
instructors
gave
themselves
no
such
trouble
they
set
out
their
wares
if
the
students
helped
themselves
so
much
the
better
if
they
did
so
much
the
worse
for
the
students
neale
the
professors
for
lazy
but
he
was
going
to
let
them
put
it
over
on
him
that
way
another
time
he
would
read
everything
they
suggested
and
more
they
would
be
astonished
by
the
brilliance
of
his
finals
but
just
then
baseball
practice
started
in
the
cage
and
neale
forgot
all
about
his
vendetta
against
the
professors
at
baseball
he
expected
to
shine
this
he
had
really
played
before
coming
to
college
april
saw
the
freshman
baseball
squad
practising
on
south
field
it
was
a
terrible
jolt
to
neale
to
find
himself
in
the
discard
his
game
had
not
compared
favorably
with
the
play
of
graduates
of
prep
schools
he
was
thrown
back
on
the
library
perhaps
it
was
just
as
well
he
told
himself
with
philosophy
after
all
he
was
there
among
other
things
to
get
an
education
chapter
xxiii
the
event
of
that
summer
the
only
one
that
counted
for
him
was
a
long
trip
which
he
took
as
and
up
into
the
mountains
of
southern
vermont
grandfather
whole
life
had
been
spent
in
handling
timber
in
one
way
and
another
and
all
his
old
friends
and
associates
were
in
that
world
every
one
had
the
greatest
respect
for
old
crittenden
even
now
when
he
was
so
old
that
he
could
do
no
more
cruising
engage
in
no
more
active
speculation
sitting
around
on
the
at
the
mill
or
on
the
porch
of
the
crittenden
house
grandfather
somehow
had
a
finger
in
many
a
timber
deal
people
came
to
consult
him
and
to
get
him
to
go
halves
on
buys
bigger
than
they
had
capital
for
from
the
time
he
had
been
a
little
boy
neale
had
been
the
unconsidered
witness
of
innumerable
such
interviews
and
had
laughed
inwardly
with
considerable
family
pride
to
see
how
completely
grandfather
in
his
baggy
old
country
clothes
held
his
own
and
better
against
the
younger
men
who
came
to
talk
business
with
him
the
summer
after
neale
freshman
year
the
proposition
was
a
big
buy
of
wild
land
from
which
grandfather
himself
had
skimmed
the
cream
thirty
years
ago
and
sold
for
nothing
afterwards
but
which
old
crittenden
opined
cocking
a
shrewd
old
eye
in
reflection
must
have
again
come
to
some
exploitable
value
three
men
were
to
go
up
unobtrusively
and
through
it
back
and
forth
till
they
could
make
a
fair
report
on
what
was
there
the
plans
were
being
made
one
evening
out
on
the
porch
where
they
all
sat
in
the
long
clear
summer
twilight
grandfather
had
not
seemed
to
notice
neale
interest
in
the
talk
of
camp
outfits
and
compasses
and
packs
but
suddenly
looking
down
to
where
the
boy
stretched
his
long
gaunt
body
on
the
he
said
what
say
neale
how
you
like
to
go
along
you
could
carry
chain
when
they
had
to
run
a
line
and
i
guess
you
smart
enough
to
keep
a
fire
going
and
help
make
camp
ai
you
that
had
been
a
great
month
full
of
discomfort
and
hardship
and
fatigue
and
deep
deep
satisfaction
neale
was
the
only
boy
with
three
men
hardened
wiry
woodsmen
who
had
spent
their
lives
in
forests
not
at
all
in
the
loafing
irregular
manner
of
sportsmen
with
occasional
spurts
of
nervous
effort
and
with
long
periods
in
unfavorable
weather
of
idling
around
a
neale
three
companions
had
always
worked
in
the
woods
as
regularly
as
his
father
worked
in
his
office
rain
and
heat
and
cold
and
were
nothing
to
them
the
main
business
of
every
day
was
work
and
was
organized
sketchily
without
much
regard
for
comfort
not
to
interfere
with
work
neale
found
that
his
had
left
him
as
soft
as
dough
beside
these
lean
men
he
doggedly
sweated
himself
into
a
hardness
that
made
it
possible
for
him
to
keep
pace
with
them
at
first
when
they
turned
in
under
their
blankets
at
night
as
soon
as
dark
came
neale
had
been
too
exhausted
to
sleep
and
had
lain
awake
aching
every
one
of
his
big
bones
bruised
by
the
roughness
of
the
bed
but
inside
a
week
he
was
able
as
his
companions
did
to
stretch
out
with
one
long
deep
breath
and
to
know
nothing
more
till
morning
came
and
the
light
woke
him
to
roll
over
and
open
his
eyes
to
the
unimaginable
freshness
of
dawn
filtering
through
the
branches
over
his
head
he
drew
in
a
of
the
sweet
new
air
a
of
immaculate
beauty
and
fell
heavily
asleep
again
till
later
one
of
his
companions
kicked
him
awake
to
take
his
share
of
getting
breakfast
and
packing
up
for
the
day
tramp
the
three
talked
very
little
of
anything
most
of
their
prodigious
capacity
for
effort
going
into
their
work
and
they
never
talked
at
all
of
the
beauty
which
was
the
background
of
their
lives
but
they
occasionally
paid
a
silent
offish
tribute
to
that
beauty
by
going
a
little
out
of
their
way
to
some
evidently
from
their
talk
familiar
to
them
since
boyhood
this
was
generally
the
top
of
a
cliff
or
rocky
slide
where
there
were
no
trees
to
obscure
the
view
arrived
there
they
never
did
anything
but
sit
and
swing
their
feet
over
emptiness
pitch
stones
into
the
void
below
them
and
quarrel
with
each
other
about
the
identification
of
different
peaks
and
hollows
in
the
vast
wooded
expanse
of
mountains
before
them
but
they
were
always
more
than
usually
silent
after
such
a
glimpse
of
the
spaciousness
of
the
world
and
for
one
neale
found
a
greatness
in
his
heart
to
match
the
greatness
which
had
filled
his
eyes
once
as
they
sat
thus
on
a
crag
throwing
stones
and
smoking
the
head
old
martin
hoardman
remarked
to
neale
of
whom
they
usually
took
little
notice
see
that
high
range
and
then
that
other
beyond
it
the
one
with
the
mountain
in
the
middle
neale
nodded
you
never
guess
it
but
there
a
valley
down
in
between
them
two
with
a
sight
of
folks
in
it
and
farms
and
everything
another
man
said
why
old
man
crittenden
got
a
brother
lives
there
ai
that
the
ashley
valley
he
runs
an
mill
there
martin
observed
yep
i
drawed
many
a
load
of
logs
to
the
old
mill
neale
remembered
the
old
man
who
had
visited
mill
one
day
when
he
was
a
little
boy
he
had
said
then
he
would
go
up
to
ashley
some
day
and
make
uncle
burton
a
visit
well
if
he
were
a
crow
or
a
hawk
he
could
do
it
now
in
about
half
an
hour
he
sat
dreaming
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
two
hazy
blue
lines
of
mountains
which
stood
up
so
high
and
so
close
to
each
other
that
they
entirely
hid
the
valley
between
it
must
be
a
quiet
sheltered
spot
that
valley
time
to
be
movin
on
said
old
martin
getting
to
his
feet
and
striding
off
into
the
woods
with
his
strong
unelastic
gait
at
the
end
of
five
weeks
they
were
plodding
back
up
the
road
to
the
crittenden
house
neale
not
to
be
distinguished
from
the
other
men
the
road
seemed
hard
and
narrow
and
foolish
to
them
the
house
and
barn
like
toys
the
world
about
them
on
so
small
a
scale
that
their
widened
eyes
could
scarcely
distinguish
one
thing
from
another
neale
had
the
distinct
impression
when
he
stepped
into
the
kitchen
that
if
he
stood
up
straight
he
would
put
his
head
through
the
ceiling
and
what
a
comical
trifling
thing
a
chair
was
he
felt
afraid
to
let
his
whole
weight
come
down
on
it
and
expected
it
to
go
to
pieces
in
his
hand
it
felt
so
flimsy
but
his
bed
was
good
oh
very
good
he
slept
till
noon
the
next
day
and
was
wakened
by
grandfather
coming
up
to
see
what
the
matter
was
he
scrambled
up
rubbing
his
eyes
and
staring
his
pyjamas
open
upon
his
broad
chest
his
long
arms
bare
grandfather
stood
looking
at
him
for
a
moment
before
he
went
back
downstairs
he
did
not
say
a
word
except
you
going
to
eat
breakfast
and
dinner
together
i
guess
but
neale
knew
that
grandfather
was
very
well
pleased
with
what
he
saw
grandfather
was
a
pretty
good
old
scout
anyhow
he
thought
as
he
washed
gingerly
in
the
white
basin
which
seemed
appallingly
breakable
to
him
chapter
xxiv
and
then
it
was
time
to
go
back
to
college
sophomore
year
was
what
a
change
from
his
sensation
of
a
year
ago
now
he
was
blatantly
sure
of
every
step
in
the
elaborate
and
illogical
ritual
that
makes
up
undergraduate
life
he
stood
between
college
hall
and
the
library
all
one
happy
afternoon
wringing
the
hands
of
sophomores
as
uplifted
with
their
status
as
he
there
griswold
the
assistant
manager
hailed
him
and
carried
him
off
to
the
football
house
on
street
he
found
the
office
on
the
first
floor
crowded
with
all
the
leaders
and
of
the
football
organization
andrews
shook
hands
with
him
and
actually
remembered
his
name
instead
of
calling
him
freshman
it
was
great
to
be
a
report
in
the
gym
at
three
said
andrews
you
better
live
at
the
house
this
season
fix
him
up
with
a
room
charley
he
turned
and
went
on
talking
with
mcclurg
something
about
officials
for
the
fordham
game
bixby
reached
over
and
picked
up
a
paper
from
the
welter
on
his
desk
crittenden
you
find
a
lot
of
cots
in
the
front
room
take
any
one
that
loose
i
have
any
clothes
with
me
explained
neale
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
he
would
be
accepted
into
the
very
center
of
things
this
way
never
mind
bring
but
you
better
beat
it
up
and
stake
out
your
claim
to
a
cot
now
the
telephone
rang
and
bixby
snatched
it
up
columbia
football
house
yes

is
bixby
speaking
no
that
do
those
shoes

promised

this
afternoon

you
send
them

lots
of
firms

want
our
trade
neale
went
upstairs
and
found
a
room
with
six
cots
made
up
four
of
them
had
or
books
on
them
to
show
occupancy
over
by
the
window
he
saw
billings
last
year
sitting
at
a
table
with
a
thin
slight
upper
classman
neale
thought
he
recognized
him
grant
his
name
was
one
of
the
college
leaders
debating
team
spec
managing
board
phi
beta
kappa
that
sort
of
chap
billings
big
body
was
hunched
miserably
forward
over
a
book
his
forehead
wrinkled
as
neale
looked
at
them
grant
reached
forward
shut
up
the
book
and
pulled
it
towards
him
no
use
billings
it
only
ball

to
keep
on
with
that
math
not

only
one
condition

you
through

you
learned
those
pieces

gave
you
billings
straightened
up
and
recited
in
a
stumbling
as
shelley
beautifully
says

lie
down
like
a
sick
child
and
weep
and
weep
and
weep
this
life
of
woe
prompted
grant
and
it
like

if
you
do
get
it
quite
right
all
right
for
that
now
have
the
other
ones
at
this
point
billings
said
violently
in
very
forcible
language
that
poems
were
all
such
damn
silly
rot
he
could
learn
them
and
grant
unsurprised
and
peremptory
answered
that
it
did
make
a
damned
bit
of
difference
how
silly
and
rotten
they
were
they
could
be
learned
you
got
brains
enough
to
get
a
sheet
by
heart

lousy
with
ends

anything
neale
admitted
that
he
might
be
considered
a
grind
grant
jumped
up
what
and
on
the
football
squad
too
he
stared
hard
at
neale
as
at
a
strange
animal
and
conjectured
aloud
well
you
must
be
a
dub
of
course
never
knew
a
varsity
man
whose
was
stuffed
with
neale
apparently
showed
some
of
the
alarm
this
caused
him
for
the
added
oh
you
get
your
chance
just
the
same
judging
by
the
number
of
boobs
alpine
and
i
are
coaching
any
dub
who
is
eligible
will
have
a
smell
at
the
varsity
at
least
for
the
early
games
till
we
can
shove
the
regular
varsity
men
through
their
conditions
everybody
over
to
the
roared
a
voice
from
the
lower
hallway
neale
tossed
his
derby
on
one
of
the
unpreëmpted
cots
and
ran
downstairs
as
he
bounded
down
flight
after
flight
he
could
hear
grant
leaning
over
the
top
banister
yelling
to
the
manager
to
have
greenway
found
and
delivered
to
him
at
once
it
was
great
to
breathe
the
sweaty
air
of
the
again
to
strip
and
pull
on
your
rough
jersey
and
feel
it
rubbing
the
skin
of
your
shoulders
great
to
hail
the
men
you
knew
and
have
them
slap
you
on
the
back
all
over
on
the
jump
the
squad
clattered
out
their
cleats
scraping
and
slipping
on
the
marble
steps
practice
that
afternoon
was
what
the
coaches
called
light
that
is
no
bones
were
broken
they
fell
on
the
ball
and
it
gladdened
neale
heart
to
see
the
new
men
hop
into
the
air
and
bang
down
on
one
hip
just
as
he
used
to
last
season
they
tackled
the
dummy
they
went
down
under
punts
that
sultry
september
afternoon
all
of
them
even
the
line
men
time
after
time
till
the
sweat
soaked
even
through
their
neale
was
as
he
hobbled
back
to
the
and
pulled
off
his
dripping
jersey
what
luxury
to
slip
under
the
shower
hot
first
till
the
dirt
was
all
off
then
turn
the
handle
cool
cool
cooler
cold
to
lean
forward
and
feel
it
patter
on
your
back
lean
backward
and
feel
the
cold
hard
drops
sting
your
face
and
chest
as
he
lay
in
pompeian
ease
on
the
rubbing
table
josh
went
so
far
as
to
tell
him
that
his
muscles
were
in
pretty
fair
shape
compared
to
some
of
them
that
was
the
trip
and
how
he
tore
into
the
that
night
it
was
good
to
be
alive
to
be
a
to
be
on
the
football
squad
grant
prophecy
turned
out
correct
four
of
the
regular
varsity
men
were
debarred
by
the
faculty
committee
and
the
eligible
subs
made
the
most
of
their
opportunity
one
of
the
vacant
places
was
left
and
neale
who
that
summer
had
grown
some
flesh
and
muscle
on
his
lanky
limbs
and
now
weighed
a
hundred
and
stripped
put
his
whole
soul
into
the
quest
and
nosed
out
biffy
mcfadden
for
the
job
mcfadden
knew
more
than
neale
the
coach
made
no
secret
of
neale
lack
of
sophistication
but
he
weighed
less
and
was
only
a
little
faster
so
neale
was
given
although
grudgingly
his
chance
and
took
it
as
though
it
had
been
his
one
chance
to
save
his
soul
alive
he
played
against
rutgers
proud
yet
reassured
at
lining
up
by
the
side
of
big
tod
mcalpine
and
was
fairly
translated
when
he
went
over
the
line
just
as
easily
as
if
it
had
been
in
practice
for
one
of
columbia
five
touchdowns
against
williams
a
week
later
he
played
again
and
did
nothing
either
very
good
or
very
bad
just
before
the
harvard
game
garland
was
squeezed
through
a
special
examination
in
latin
and
after
that
neale
had
no
chance
for
the
varsity
but
he
considered
about
neck
and
neck
with
biffy
as
first
sub
for
the
and
he
and
biffy
grew
together
in
a
loyal
comradeship
as
like
a
young
tree
which
suddenly
puts
out
a
long
new
shoot
in
a
new
direction
neale
learned
a
lot
of
things
that
autumn
different
from
anything
he
had
learned
before
in
the
first
place
living
in
the
constant
unrepressed
society
of
thirty
other
young
men
he
acquired
a
good
deal
of
social
ease
of
a
sort
learned
much
profanity
many
foul
and
a
few
funny
stories
by
the
aid
of
which
he
was
able
to
piece
together
the
isolated
facts
he
had
already
picked
up
about
sex
and
appear
to
his
brothers
a
great
deal
more
sophisticated
than
he
was
he
also
learned
much
technical
football
to
pick
openings
in
a
broken
field
to
jump
from
a
crouching
start
the
instant
the
ball
began
to
move
to
find
his
stride
and
be
going
at
top
speed
in
three
paces
instinctively
to
hurdle
when
the
defense
was
on
the
ground
to
bull
over
it
with
churning
knees
when
it
was
waist
high
to
lower
his
head
and
ram
through
when
it
was
standing
up
and
always
to
kick
crawl
squirm
the
ball
forward
even
if
it
was
only
a
half
an
inch
he
learned
a
great
deal
more
than
that
all
that
autumn
he
played
football
thought
football
dreamed
football
lived
football
the
savage
spartan
football
code
was
his
code
to
do
anything
everything
for
a
for
the
team
to
fight
as
hard
in
midfield
with
the
score
hopelessly
against
him
as
half
a
yard
from
the
enemy
to
endure
the
agony
of
being
tackled
on
thighs
to
get
up
and
drive
back
as
hard
as
ever
into
the
line
to
the
same
certain
torment
to
go
to
any
length
to
put
an
opponent
out
of
the
game
any
length
except
being
caught
and
having
his
team
penalized
by
the
officials
and
no
matter
to
what
outbreaks
of
emotion
his
exhausted
body
and
nerves
might
give
way
in
the
to
walk
out
of
it
with
his
jaw
set
his
face
impassive
and
never
let
an
enemy
rooter
see
a
tear
in
his
eye
it
was
by
no
means
the
education
in
the
humanities
and
liberal
arts
with
which
the
university
was
supposed
to
be
providing
him
but
an
education
of
a
kind
it
certainly
was
above
all
at
a
period
when
his
raw
new
personality
was
all
one
huge
void
clamoring
for
something
to
fill
it
football
filled
his
life
full
to
the
brim
there
was
no
vacuum
left
to
be
filled
either
by
culture
or
deviltry
all
through
the
rest
of
that
season
he
played
regularly
at
left
on
the
scrub
relishing
to
the
full
those
afternoons
when
the
scrub
with
all
the
best
of
the
decisions
scored
on
a
crippled
varsity
rejoicing
even
more
for
it
meant
power
to
the
team
when
the
varsity
struck
its
gait
and
pounded
over
the
bleeding
and
prostrate
scrub
after
the
season
neale
found
himself
entitled
to
wear
the
varsity
stripe
and
monogram
this
gave
him
a
certain
position
in
his
class
he
was
somebody
two
fraternities
made
discreet
overtures
to
him
neale
considered
encouraged
lamma
kappa
pi
which
seemed
to
have
more
athletic
men
than
the
other
was
duly
pledged
and
initiated
and
now
came
a
change
in
his
manner
of
living
the
chapter
needed
roomers
to
help
pay
the
rent
for
the
frat
house
could
brother
crittenden
move
into
a
bedroom
neale
broached
the
subject
to
his
father
and
mother
pointing
out
how
much
more
time
he
would
have
for
study
if
he
lived
near
the
university
they
surprised
him
by
treating
the
matter
with
unexpected
solemnity
and
delaying
decision
for
several
days
but
in
the
end
they
gave
their
consent
it
did
not
occur
to
neale
as
he
slung
his
clothes
into
a
trunk
that
he
was
saying
to
his
and
if
it
occurred
to
his
mother
silently
helping
him
pack
she
kept
her
thoughts
to
herself
an
event
that
seemed
of
much
more
importance
to
neale
was
a
move
that
father
made
on
his
own
initiative
after
a
long
homily
on
responsibility
and
learning
the
value
of
money
he
proposed
to
grant
neale
an
allowance
of
fifty
dollars
a
month
to
be
paid
on
the
first
of
the
month
in
advance
out
of
this
neale
was
to
buy
food
shelter
and
incidentals
father
was
to
go
on
paying
college
fees
so
brother
crittenden
installed
himself
in
the
hall
bedroom
and
according
to
fraternity
practice
decorated
it
with
pennants
foils
and
masks
although
he
did
not
fence
and
sword
bayonets
because
they
looked
impressive
and
were
cheap
at
bannerman
to
make
a
real
college
room
he
knew
by
comparing
it
with
others
it
should
have
a
dozen
photographs
but
neale
knew
no
girl
well
enough
to
beg
photographs
from
her
he
excused
this
lack
by
telling
himself
that
he
had
no
use
for
women
he
was
at
college
for
the
stern
man
business
of
making
the
football
team
nothing
that
might
interfere
with
the
pink
of
physical
condition
or
the
singleness
of
mental
resolution
should
have
a
place
in
his
life
and
indeed
for
the
six
weeks
which
separated
the
end
of
the
season
from
examinations
he
stuck
to
a
monastic
schedule
the
mandate
had
gone
forth
that
football
men
must
somehow
manage
to
pass
a
majority
of
their
subjects
and
neale
fraternity
brothers
never
tried
to
coax
him
away
from
the
table
where
he
sat
wrestling
with
cicero
letters
or
the
carolingian
empire
not
even
to
play
poker
or
go
around
little
coney
island
but
after
it
was
different
nobody
could
possibly
start
worrying
about
the
finals
for
three
months
yet
the
season
began
and
with
it
the
informal
gym
dances
after
each
game
nunc
est
bibendum
nunc
pede
libero
was
in
the
air
not
only
in
latin
classes
neale
went
to
the
first
games
in
the
cap
and
sweater
he
wore
about
the
campus
and
when
the
dance
began
sneaked
out
dodging
behind
pillars
to
avoid
compromising
those
of
his
chapter
resplendent
in
evening
clothes
with
girl
partners
more
resplendent
still
but
such
seclusion
was
not
to
last
other
fellows
the
fussers
of
his
chapter
were
caught
with
extra
girls
on
their
hands
sisters
or
cousins
or
and
neale
in
spite
of
his
avowed
principle
of
dancing
only
when
he
could
run
away
fast
enough
to
escape
was
hauled
in
to
be
the
necessary
extra
man
for
the
more
or
less
anonymous
girl
to
be
provided
for
logically
enough
other
advances
followed
finding
that
they
had
landed
not
only
a
promising
athlete
in
brother
crittenden
but
a
passable
social
member
the
rest
of
the
chapter
hastened
to
count
him
in
he
learned
to
play
poker
to
drink
more
beer
than
he
wanted
to
keep
a
pipe
going
without
burning
his
mouth
he
learned
where
to
go
for
chop
suey
to
sniff
at
a
cigar
and
look
wise
before
he
bought
it
to
pretend
to
like
his
cocktails
dry
although
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
did
not
like
them
at
all
he
learned
to
rattle
off
a
line
of
bright
slangy
compliments
at
college
dances
or
frat
teas
and
to
take
a
flashier
line
with
chippies
at
the
dance
halls
he
added
to
his
store
of
oaths
and
smutty
stories
the
chapter
thought
well
of
him
and
he
thought
even
better
of
himself
by
the
time
spring
came
neale
felt
happily
sure
that
he
was
seeing
life
without
making
a
fool
of
himself
which
was
according
to
his
latest
philosophy
borrowed
from
horace
the
right
thing
to
do
he
would
be
nineteen
in
a
few
months
now
time
to
attain
a
calm
mature
unsurprised
acceptance
of
the
world
no
enthusiasms
about
anything
except
football
of
course
that
was
far
above
all
philosophies
of
life
in
the
spring
of
his
sophomore
year
neale
was
consuming
pipefuls
of
tobacco
and
meditating
on
what
he
called
his
past
life
censuring
or
approving
his
actions
by
the
newly
acquired
of
the
golden
mean
what
a
youthful
idiot
he
had
been
about
don
roberts
that
was
so
long
ago
that
he
could
smile
cynically
at
both
his
enthusiasm
and
his
disillusion
each
equally
far
from
balance
balance
poise
that
was
the
right
dope
for
a
man
of
the
world
and
yet
spring
was
in
the
air
and
it
was
hard
even
for
the
ripe
maturity
of
nineteen
to
be
perfectly
balanced
neale
had
no
girl
at
hand
and
was
betrayed
into
working
off
the
excitement
of
spring
days
by
writing
an
english
theme
on
the
tulips
in
union
square
so
much
early
may
both
of
style
and
personality
seeped
into
this
that
the
jaded
discouraged
young
professor
of
english
felt
his
heart
leap
up
with
incredulous
hope
and
pleasure
to
encourage
the
writer
he
read
parts
of
it
aloud
to
the
class
while
neale
very
soul
scorched
with
shame
one
of
his
classmates
a
brilliant
precocious
fellow
with
literary
aspirations
came
up
to
him
afterwards
and
congratulated
him
enviously
on
his
success
it
was
a
terrible
experience
all
around
neale
vowed
furiously
to
himself
that
never
again
would
he
let
any
real
feeling
slip
into
a
college
theme
chapter
xxv
west
adams
and
grandfather
house
looked
queer
and
countrified
and
it
was
a
long
long
way
from
a
frat
house
on
street
to
that
plain
bedroom
so
full
of
his
and
personality
that
neale
felt
ill
at
ease
and
restless
there
how
could
you
live
up
to
your
ideal
of
horatian
calm
and
sophisticated
tolerance
towards
human
life
in
the
presence
of
people
who
had
known
you
when
you
were
in
short
trousers
who
only
a
few
years
before
had
been
giving
you
hot
lemonade
for
a
cold
and
tucking
you
up
in
bed
no
west
adams
was
impossible
he
looked
inside
the
emerson
one
day
remembering
what
an
impression
it
had
made
on
him
and
found
it
like
west
adams
very
dull
the
man
is
so
terribly
in
earnest
he
told
himself
and
was
enchanted
at
the
superior
oscar
wilde
tone
of
his
dictum
the
next
day
he
thought
of
billy
peters
and
knew
that
he
was
saved
billy
was
the
most
amusing
of
his
frat
brothers
the
one
now
nearest
to
him
for
he
remembered
that
billy
spent
the
summers
in
the
berkshires
he
wrote
to
billy
asking
him
to
come
up
for
a
couple
of
weeks
and
go
camping
with
him
somewhere
up
the
deerfield
neale
would
meet
him
at
whatever
station
billy
could
make
and
they
would
start
at
once
he
did
invite
billy
to
grandfather
not
because
he
was
ashamed
of
grandfather
not
at
all
he
just
did
think
it
would
interest
billy
there
in
due
time
billy
answer
came
asking
neale
to
cut
out
the
wilderness
project
and
come
down
to
make
him
a
visit
in
the
berkshires
neale
considered
he
liked
billy
and
west
adams
was
deadly
dull
why
not
there
was
no
good
reason
why
not
he
packed
his
and
went
billy
met
him
and
drove
him
to
the
peters
cottage
a
remodeled
several
miles
from
town
peters
was
cordially
polite
billy
little
kid
sister
turned
blue
admiring
eyes
on
her
big
brother
friend
who
was
presented
as
a
most
prodigious
athlete
after
supper
at
billy
suggestion
they
walked
over
to
the
hotel
two
remodeled
with
shingled
sides
joined
by
piazzas
billy
introduced
him
to
the
finest
little
girl
ever
and
neale
was
only
knowing
billy
fairly
well
to
find
she
the
same
as
the
finest
little
girl
of
the
winter
before
but
that
was
nothing
to
neale
there
were
plenty
of
other
girls
all
delighted
to
buzz
around
him
to
have
him
dance
or
play
to
make
fudge
or
walk
in
the
moonlight
some
were
pretty
and
some
were
not
some
were
bright
and
some
just
boisterous
and
it
was
all
the
same
to
neale
the
horatian
pose
was
a
great
success
he
was
delighted
with
himself
at
the
end
of
a
week
he
prepared
to
leave
but
billy
could
see
it
that
way
it
was
true
that
polly
was
going
to
have
a
couple
of
girl
friends
at
the
house
next
week
and
would
want
neale
room
but
then
they
want
bill
room
too
if
billy
was
to
be
exiled
to
a
tent
why
could
crit
keep
him
company
they
move
the
tent
up
into
the
glen
and
really
camp
out
cook
their
own
grub
and
everything
crit
had
said
he
wanted
to
camp
out
why
not
after
all
there
was
any
real
reason
why
he
should
go
next
week
there
was
the
coaching
parade
and
all
sorts
of
fun
decorating
the
hotel
with
ferns
and
daisies
then
there
was
a
boating
excursion
to
long
pond
where
sarah
davis
fell
overboard
and
neale
pulled
her
out
then
there
was
a
fateful
in
the
august
full
moon
very
near
to
neale
nineteenth
birthday
and
there
he
met
miss
austin
a
new
arrival
at
the
hotel
she
was
almost
as
tall
as
neale
which
was
very
tall
indeed
for
a
girl
and
she
looked
to
neale
as
though
she
might
have
stepped
right
out
of
a
gibson
illustration
this
utterly
superlative
impression
of
beauty
and
good
form
was
not
lessened
even
in
broad
daylight
the
next
morning
when
he
saw
her
again
on
the
where
she
said
with
a
special
look
for
him
in
her
very
fine
gray
eyes
she
did
not
play
tennis
she
sat
on
a
bench
at
the
side
under
a
purple
silk
parasol
her
long
full
white
skirts
frilling
out
in
a
plaited
cone
her
pretty
fluffy
brown
hair
arranged
in
a
high
pompadour
which
stayed
impeccable
as
the
girls
grew
hot
and
red
their
hair
straggling
in
straight
wisps
across
their
shining
wet
foreheads
had
neale
ever
thought
he
scorned
girls
who
sat
cool
and
on
a
bench
while
others
played
tennis
as
soon
as
the
set
was
over
he
went
to
sit
beside
her
she
glanced
at
him
out
of
her
gray
eyes
and
looked
away
again
neale
pulse
beat
more
quickly
and
he
looked
hard
at
the
curve
of
her
cheek
then
they
began
to
talk
before
she
went
in
to
lunch
she
had
told
him
with
a
wistful
note
in
her
voice
that
she
was
glad
she
met
him
because
most
of
the
people
at
the
hotel
bored
her
so
neale
answered
the
truth
striking
him
for
the
first
time
that
of
the
people
bored
him
too
if
other
people
were
what
bored
them
they
certainly
must
have
been
free
from
ennui
for
the
next
few
days
for
they
saw
little
of
any
one
but
each
other
neale
days
and
evenings
were
good
or
bad
according
to
the
extent
of
his
success
in
monopolizing
miss
austin
on
the
whole
the
evenings
were
the
best
the
evenings
when
they
sat
in
a
far
corner
of
the
hotel
piazza
and
compared
notes
about
their
views
on
life
and
literature
miss
austin
paid
neale
the
compliment
he
most
appreciated
she
affected
to
consider
him
as
as
she
was
what
did
he
think
of
meredith
and
ibsen
she
discussed
bernard
shaw
and
the
second
mrs
tanqueray
neale
had
to
trust
to
copious
bluffing
to
confide
heavily
in
his
taciturnity
letting
her
run
on
till
she
expressed
opinions
tangible
enough
for
him
to
agree
with
her
the
climax
of
the
season
was
the
fancy
dress
dance
at
the
prospect
house
everybody
went
billy
in
a
blanket
woodchuck
skins
and
turkey
feathers
considered
himself
a
passable
uncas
neale
who
had
caught
the
early
morning
train
up
to
west
adams
and
the
milk
train
back
wore
his
football
suit
with
his
white
sweater
like
a
cloak
the
arms
tied
under
his
chin
hot
but
very
becoming
with
billy
he
started
conscientiously
to
dance
in
rotation
with
all
the
girls
from
their
hotel
his
second
dance
was
with
miss
austin
she
was
in
black
with
a
black
lace
mantilla
and
pinned
in
her
hair
was
one
of
the
roses
neale
had
ransacked
pittsfield
to
buy
he
forgot
the
others
forgot
everything
but
the
rhythm
of
their
steps
together
they
danced
sat
out
on
the
verandah
danced
again
it
was
pointed
shameless
the
chaperon
whose
daughter
was
sitting
a
disconsolate
glared
at
them
and
they
danced
on
had
this
young
blade
giving
himself
up
wholly
to
the
glamor
of
the
moment
had
he
ever
taken
the
cold
dry
heartless
doctrine
of
horace
as
a
guide
to
life
he
danced
on
had
he
said
he
only
danced
when
he
was
caught
and
had
to
he
danced
on
thrilling
to
the
rhythm
like
the
swinging
beat
of
hearts
in
young
bodies
at
last
the
piano
violin
and
cornet
the
orchestra
imported
from
the
city
of
north
adams
broke
into
home
sweet
home
and
the
last
waltz
began
slow
languorous
the
climax
of
the
wonderful
evening
for
neale
then
miss
austin
staged
her
dramatic
effect
as
the
party
broke
up
she
said
putting
out
one
hand
to
neale
and
resting
the
other
on
her
mother
arm
crittenden
and
she
looked
down
at
the
roses
he
had
given
her
and
mother
and
i
are
leaving
on
the
morning
train
i
only
waited
to
have
that
last
dance
she
waited
an
instant
to
let
this
have
its
effect
and
added
in
a
lower
tone
thank
you
thank
you
for
for
making
my
stay
here
so
pleasant
now
there
was
under
neale
skin
neither
a
calm
horatian
philosopher
nor
a
dashing
young
blade
there
was
only
a
shy
awkward
boy
of
nineteen
taken
entirely
unawares
struck
dumb
by
the
surge
of
emotion
within
him
helpless
and
inarticulate
except
for
a
muttered
he
shook
miss
austin
hand
and
walked
away
with
apparent
steadiness
but
afterwards
when
billy
was
snoring
inside
the
tent
neale
sat
on
the
platform
outside
and
wrestled
with
destiny
what
a
stiff
frozen
lump
he
had
been
not
to
have
been
able
to
speak
out
what
was
in
his
heart
she
was
and
he
had
no
photograph
of
her
what
an
idiot
never
to
have
thought
to
ask
for
one
not
a
keepsake
not
even
a
kiss
it
was
too
hideous
no
man
with
any
virility
would
let
destiny
ride
over
him
like
that
he
would
be
masterful
he
would
take
the
same
train
with
her
in
the
morning
he
would
be
reckless
follow
her
up
great
cæsar
ghost
but
it
was
cold
out
there
the
night
dampness
pierced
through
even
his
thick
sweater
he
staggered
to
his
cot
rolled
up
in
the
blankets
and
fell
instantly
asleep
he
once
at
dawn
with
the
first
rays
of
sunlight
rolled
over
looked
out
into
the
breathless
pure
beauty
of
the
new
day
dropping
slowly
in
a
rain
of
golden
light
through
the
great
trees
thought
hazily
that
he
was
in
the
green
mountains
again
and
fell
asleep
more
profoundly
than
ever
he
was
really
very
tired
and
his
old
faculty
for
prodigious
sleeping
reasserted
itself
when
he
finally
awoke
the
day
was
ripe
and
the
light
had
a
late
look
sure
enough
his
watch
said
a
quarter
past
eleven
he
sat
up
and
stretched
and
rubbed
his
hands
back
and
forth
through
his
frowsy
hair
billy
had
eaten
his
breakfast
and
gone
but
he
must
have
brought
up
the
mail
and
left
it
for
neale
to
find
for
a
letter
now
fell
off
cot
to
the
floor
the
letter
was
typed
brief
and
direct
like
the
writer
dear
crittenden
we
have
a
hard
schedule
ahead
of
us
this
season
i
want
all
last
year
squad
to
report
at
the
football
house
for
practice
on
september
i
can
count
on
you
not
to
be
late
mcalpine
capt
neale
read
it
over
and
over
stupidly
at
first
and
then
with
growing
excitement
alone
in
the
tent
he
allowed
a
broad
childish
unrestrained
smile
of
pure
pleasure
and
pride
to
shine
all
over
his
face
then
the
date
struck
his
eye
he
was
to
report
on
september
first
and
this
was
august
gosh
less
than
a
week
to
get
into
condition
not
a
single
minute
to
lose
his
chance
might
depend
on
his
being
in
condition
chance
he
tossed
the
blankets
off
and
sprang
up
making
plans
rapidly
the
left
by
billy
was
still
warm
in
the
banked
ashes
but
neale
put
it
aside
no
coffee
after
his
breakfast
of
oatmeal
and
toast
he
looked
longingly
at
his
pipe
but
did
not
light
it
no
tobacco
he
remembered
that
this
was
about
the
time
for
miss
train
but
he
did
not
change
his
clothes
to
go
down
to
see
her
off
no
girls
still
in
his
football
togs
just
as
he
had
danced
the
last
waltz
he
set
off
for
the
first
of
his
training
a
over
the
hills
chapter
xxvi
september
after
the
first
day
practice
neale
and
biffy
mcfadden
were
jogging
back
to
the
together
great
is
it
grunted
biffy
rubbing
his
jersey
sleeve
over
his
sweaty
forehead
looks
like
a
job
for
either
you
or
me
i
have
to
step
lively
if
i
get
the
job
just
you
wait
till
i
get
some
of
the
fat
off
me
i
soft
yet
he
thought
bitterly
of
time
wasted
on
the
hotel
piazza
soft
hell
cried
biffy
all
i
say
is
i
hope
you
never
tackle
me
when
you
hard
thought
you
slapped
me
with
a
piece
of
lead
pipe
just
after
i
caught
that
punt
mcalpine
and
andrews
were
standing
outside
the
gym
door
neale
stopped
to
shake
hands
with
his
captain
whom
he
had
not
seen
before
practice
mcalpine
punched
him
appraisingly
in
the
abdomen
not
so
bad
some
fat
but
there
muscle
behind
it
neale
made
way
for
atkins
of
the
team
an
alumnus
always
hanging
around
the
squad
every
season
he
was
supposed
to
be
devoting
his
heart
blood
to
down
on
wall
street
but
a
wistful
exile
from
the
world
to
which
he
had
given
the
passion
of
his
youth
he
always
came
uptown
in
the
fall
to
watch
football
practice
also
which
was
of
much
more
importance
he
spent
his
summer
vacation
looking
up
available
football
material
out
in
the
bushes
as
he
expressed
it
he
now
stopped
in
front
of
the
captain
with
a
grin
of
pride
and
jerking
his
head
towards
an
approaching
player
he
inquired
well
how
about
him
mcalpine
replied
with
enthusiasm
built
like
a
piano
is
he
you
raise
him
neale
followed
their
eyes
and
saw
a
squat
swarthy
linesman
rolling
past
them
towards
the
gym
door
where
i
raise
him
stole
him
from
the
of
father
something
or
other
up
in
the
oodles
of
money
son
was
all
set
up
to
go
to
pennsy
but
we
got
him
down
here
and
led
him
up
and
down
the
great
white
way
a
couple
of
nights
nobody
could
coax
him
away
now
unless
there
a
university
at
paris
mcalpine
stared
after
the
powerful
back
and
shoulders
filling
the
doorway
god
what
a
brute
baby
hippo
walking
on
his
hind
legs
his
breed
anyway
some
sort
of
hunky
i
not
up
on
their
stud
book
but
i
say
he
a
cross
between
a
slovak
and
a
ruthenian
wild
boar
lots
of
space
in
his
garret
but
you
ca
hurt
him
with
a
but
how
in
merry
hell
are
we
going
to
keep
him
eligible
what
courses
did
you
get
him
entered
for
oh
assorted
snap
courses
english
lit
mostly
and
he
has
a
tame
tutor
that
lives
with
him
and
does
the
studying
how
you
suppose
he
ever
got
through
high
school
neale
left
them
talking
and
stepped
into
the
admiring
enviously
the
massive
of
the
new
student
of
english
literature
there
were
horribly
emotional
ups
and
downs
in
the
junior
football
season
for
neale
ups
and
downs
that
ploughed
and
harrowed
his
young
soul
planted
many
seeds
in
his
heart
and
left
him
at
the
end
of
the
season
with
so
much
new
knowledge
of
himself
and
others
to
digest
with
experiences
so
rich
and
varied
dark
and
brilliant
to
look
back
on
that
he
needed
the
entire
rest
of
the
year
to
grow
up
to
them
the
other
students
those
who
did
not
play
football
seemed
to
him
like
little
boys
fooling
around
with
marbles
and
kites
so
little
did
they
know
of
the
black
depths
of
depression
and
despair
and
the
heights
of
exultation
which
crammed
his
own
personal
life
full
and
gave
him
a
premature
maturity
of
experience
like
that
of
a
boy
who
has
been
through
a
war
the
day
after
his
third
game
on
the
varsity
father
called
him
on
the
telephone
and
asked
if
he
could
come
home
and
have
dinner
with
them
to
celebrate
his
success
would
that
be
breaking
training
oh
no
neale
answered
not
if
he
got
back
to
the
house
at
nine
so
he
went
home
to
a
specially
good
dinner
just
the
kind
he
remembered
as
a
little
boy
when
there
was
company
they
talked
football
mostly
that
meant
he
and
father
talked
and
mother
saw
to
it
that
the
plates
of
her
two
men
were
filled
after
dinner
they
went
into
the
library
the
library
where
he
had
first
plunged
into
the
world
of
books
and
there
he
and
mother
sat
on
the
sofa
while
father
sat
in
his
own
chair
and
they
visited
some
more
neale
found
it
surprisingly
easy
to
talk
to
his
parents
now
almost
as
easy
as
if
they
were
strangers
during
the
last
year
he
had
lived
away
from
them
except
for
and
short
visits
in
that
time
he
had
acquired
a
little
perspective
and
the
new
shell
to
his
personality
had
set
hard
enough
so
that
he
no
longer
felt
an
irritable
distaste
of
being
looked
at
by
people
who
had
known
him
as
a
little
boy
great
scott
had
he
been
a
little
boy
the
college
junior
looked
around
on
the
walls
books
and
furniture
that
had
not
changed
a
hair
and
remembered
with
difficulty
that
he
had
once
been
a
child
in
these
surroundings
when
he
went
away
he
shook
hands
with
his
father
as
he
always
did
and
stooped
from
his
great
height
to
kiss
his
mother
as
he
always
did
why
not
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
he
might
not
kiss
his
mother
but
apparently
it
had
occurred
to
her
for
when
she
felt
on
her
lips
the
cool
fresh
boyish
pressure
of
his
lips
she
gave
a
sob
and
flung
her
arms
around
him
holding
him
close
and
crying
a
little
on
his
shoulder
why
dear
old
mother
what
was
the
matter
with
her
neale
put
both
arms
around
her
and
gave
her
a
great
hug
as
he
used
to
when
he
came
home
from
west
adams
it
had
done
him
good
to
see
his
folks
he
thought
as
he
strode
off
down
the
familiar
but
not
city
street
he
thought
affectionately
about
his
father
and
mother
for
quite
a
time
thereafter
as
far
as
the
indeed
when
the
build
of
a
reminded
him
of
the
new
swede
on
the
team
after
that
he
thought
football
intensively
a
strong
color
of
junior
tinging
all
his
thoughts
he
was
making
the
team
he
was
so
worse
how
green
how
incredibly
green
the
freshies
were
who
came
out
to
try
for
the
squad
and
he
had
beaten
biffy
to
it
although
biffy
had
almost
killed
himself
with
trying
the
weak
opponents
of
the
preliminary
season
were
easily
swamped
mcalpine
rogers
neale
with
one
of
the
tackles
back
the
big
swede
gus
larsen
or
atkins
coal
miner
whose
name
vaclav
blahoslav
stumped
the
squad
till
it
was
shortened
to
mike
tore
over
rutgers
fordham
hamilton
and
the
other
small
fry
true
the
machine
broke
tragically
down
before
princeton
even
stronger
attack
but
none
of
the
blame
for
that
attached
to
neale
he
was
kept
out
of
that
game
by
a
wrenched
ankle
and
biffy
rotten
luck
let
him
into
the
for
the
first
defeat
of
the
season
neale
really
had
luck
on
his
side
he
thought
with
some
complacency
by
next
saturday
his
ankle
was
all
right
again
and
he
trotted
out
on
franklin
field
supremely
confident
trotted
out
to
fall
straight
into
the
black
depths
of
the
bottomless
pit
for
after
that
swelling
supreme
came
a
queer
slowness
of
mind
he
found
it
hard
to
keep
his
thoughts
on
his
work
as
they
ran
through
signals
his
eyes
kept
straying
to
the
rioting
the
whistle
blew
the
came
straight
to
neale
for
the
first
time
since
freshman
year
he
felt
a
sinking
dread
that
he
might
fumble
the
ball
hit
him
on
the
chest
and
bounded
off
tod
mcalpine
fell
on
it
and
the
rushing
game
began
for
the
first
half
it
was
anybody
game
either
team
when
it
got
the
ball
could
gain
but
could
not
score
something
was
the
matter
with
neale
he
was
all
there
he
knew
he
was
playing
mechanically
but
could
seem
to
summon
the
energy
to
do
better
he
sat
listless
almost
sullen
while
andrews
harangued
the
team
between
the
halves
he
was
hardened
by
this
time
to
the
neapolitan
frenzy
of
emphasis
which
marked
exhortations
to
play
your
best
football
or
die
he
do
his
best
he
told
himself
looking
down
at
his
feet
nobody
could
do
any
more
the
second
half
began
with
an
exchange
of
punts
playing
behind
the
cyclopean
mike
neale
had
much
work
to
do
on
the
defensive
but
once
mike
was
boxed
out
on
a
straight
buck
neale
shot
his
body
in
to
plug
the
hole
and
turning
caught
a
bony
knee
in
the
back
right
over
the
kidneys
as
he
lay
on
the
ground
gasping
for
breath
he
could
see
that
he
had
even
stopped
the
play
it
had
gone
over
him
for
two
yards
oh
hell
what
was
the
use
how
his
back
ached
the
penn
quarter
seemed
to
know
he
was
feeling
wobbly
all
the
plays
were
coming
at
him
and
mike
and
most
of
them
got
by
where
the
ball
sometimes
it
came
straight
through
and
the
next
minute
on
the
same
formation
swung
outside
and
neale
uselessly
buried
under
the
interference
he
have
to
stop
it
somehow
soon
he
glanced
back
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
and
saw
the
goal
posts
less
than
five
yards
behind
the
penn
formation
was
on
his
side
again
mike
charged
like
a
buffalo
neale
rushed
in
behind
him
but
blindly
then
all
at
once
he
picked
out
the
man
with
the
ball
too
late
his
sideways
drive
for
a
tackle
missed
and
as
he
fell
his
arms
empty
he
saw
the
jersey
go
over
the
line
he
got
up
shaken
feeling
very
sick
of
himself
not
meeting
eye
while
penn
was
kicking
the
goal
neale
saw
biffy
come
bounding
out
from
the
i
to
take
crittenden
place
he
reported
it
was
like
a
blow
in
the
face
and
he
had
earned
it
neale
walked
to
the
bench
took
a
blanket
looking
carefully
away
from
the
sub
who
held
it
out
to
him
wrapped
himself
up
forced
his
face
into
its
usual
expression
of
impassivity
and
watched
the
game
it
was
not
much
to
watch
columbia
badly
up
in
the
air
pennsy
getting
stronger
every
minute
he
dreaded
the
at
the
football
house
and
took
as
deserved
andrews
verdict
crittenden
you
were
a
total
loss
i
knew
you
much
of
a
defensive
back
but
i
did
suppose
a
whale
like
you
would
let
a
skinny
little
runt
of
a
penn
sub
ride
you
back
five
yards
and
dump
you
on
your
tail
day
after
day
went
by
with
neale
in
exile
playing
once
more
on
the
scrub
the
night
before
the
brown
game
when
the
was
announced
he
got
together
a
show
of
as
he
shook
hands
with
biffy
and
wished
him
luck
but
he
lay
awake
in
the
dark
that
night
heartbroken
sternly
motionless
and
rigid
on
his
cot
his
great
hands
clenched
hard
it
was
his
virgin
sorrow
the
first
real
suffering
he
had
ever
known
the
first
real
sorrow
of
most
lives
is
usually
tempered
to
the
softness
of
immature
hearts
by
the
instinct
to
lay
the
blame
on
something
or
somebody
else
by
merciful
but
for
neale
there
was
no
fate
nor
chance
nor
enemy
nor
fickleness
of
woman
on
whom
to
lay
the
blame
there
was
no
one
to
blame
but
himself
and
before
his
time
he
felt
the
pure
rigor
of
this
knowledge
cut
deep
like
a
clean
steel
blade
it
cut
out
a
part
of
his
boyishness
forever
it
was
the
first
scar
of
the
initiation
into
manhood
neale
stood
up
to
it
like
a
man
although
so
young
a
man
no
squealing
he
commanded
himself
savagely
the
next
day
he
sat
all
through
the
game
on
the
edge
of
the
subs
bench
his
big
muscles
quivering
with
readiness
to
respond
to
an
order
to
jump
into
the
game
his
heart
sick
sick
within
him
because
the
order
did
not
come
nobody
so
much
as
looked
his
way
there
he
sat
a
big
useless
lump
what
the
matter
with
me
he
cried
out
behind
his
iroquois
mask
of
insensibility
i
got
the
strength
i
got
the
speed
i
a
quitter
the
sweat
stood
out
on
him
at
the
idea
and
at
first
helpless
before
the
dramatic
quality
of
young
imagination
he
felt
that
must
be
the
answer
yes
he
was
a
quitter
as
well
die
and
be
done
with
it
then
the
nucleus
of
what
was
to
become
neale
hardened
itself
against
this
easy
inverted
sentimentalism
and
small
as
the
nucleus
was
it
set
itself
to
consider
the
matter
in
judicial
objective
judgment
neale
went
over
his
football
for
the
last
week
as
though
it
had
been
that
of
another
player
i
did
quit
in
the
penn
game
but
other
fellows
have
had
a
slump
and
pulled
out
of
it
and
since
then
by
god
i
played
myself
out
in
every
practice
i
given
all
there
was
to
give
and
then
some
he
held
up
his
head
at
this
and
yet
if
he
was
a
quitter
what
the
matter
with
him
biffy
is
any
yet
he
must
be
better
than
i
am
or
andrews
would
give
him
my
place
is
he
said
that
with
the
accent
of
the
mystic
who
affirms
that
god
is
good
and
it
was
very
much
the
same
sort
of
in
the
house
he
was
building
to
live
in
along
in
the
second
half
atkins
the
grad
who
had
discovered
mike
stopped
his
prowl
up
and
down
the
side
lines
and
dropped
into
an
empty
space
beside
neale
look
at
that
he
cried
suddenly
did
you
see
that
neale
had
noticed
nothing
in
particular
just
a
general
tangle
of
brown
and
blue
jerseys
i
do
think
they
gained
he
said
great
scott
no
have
you
any
eyes
they
lost
about
the
brown
tripped
over
mike
legs
but
if
he
been
a
foot
further
out
he
be
going
yet
mcfadden
was
suckered
neale
took
his
eyes
for
a
moment
from
the
field
to
look
around
wonderingly
at
atkins
he
had
never
thought
of
him
before
except
with
pity
as
an
old
exile
who
could
play
any
more
could
he
really
see
all
that
in
a
play
see
just
what
every
man
had
done
atkins
went
on
now
stiffening
with
his
concentration
like
a
pointer
dog
there
it
goes
again
see
he
charging
right
on
top
of
mike
just
luck
if
he
gets
the
man
missed
him
it
was
tod
who
stopped
the
play
next
time
they
hit
the
left
side
of
our
line
watch
the
way
rogers
handles
it
atkins
bit
savagely
on
a
mouthful
of
gum
there
he
dug
his
finger
nails
into
neale
wrist
neale
could
see
rogers
rock
a
second
undecided
on
an
interferer
and
then
shoot
his
body
like
a
projectile
into
the
play
spilled
for
a
loss
that
the
stuff
he
looked
around
sharply
at
neale
if
could
use
your
head
like
that
you
be
worth
something
to
the
team
neale
stared
at
him
his
young
face
candid
with
the
astonishment
of
feeling
a
idea
inserting
itself
into
his
mind
maybe
was
what
was
the
matter
with
his
game
he
reached
up
as
he
would
have
said
to
the
upper
story
and
turned
back
to
watch
the
game
with
new
eyes
eyes
sharpened
by
intelligence
he
concentrated
on
the
defense
and
began
for
the
first
time
to
understand
the
inwardness
of
it
he
could
attain
atkins
vision
of
the
play
and
what
every
man
in
the
back
field
had
done
but
he
made
out
a
great
deal
more
than
he
ever
had
before
next
monday
at
practice
atkins
came
and
stood
behind
neale
the
business
never
seemed
to
exist
for
atkins
during
football
season
to
neale
as
he
played
on
the
scrub
atkins
poured
out
his
accumulated
tactical
lore
the
wisdom
that
choked
and
strangled
him
because
he
was
no
longer
allowed
to
put
it
into
action
seizing
on
neale
whom
he
did
not
know
personally
at
all
he
forced
his
way
into
neale
attention
and
held
it
fiercely
on
the
business
of
playing
football
intelligently
have
a
look
have
a
look
secondary
defense
finds
the
play
before
it
stirs
out
of
its
tracks
no
you
should
have
tried
a
tackle
that
time
he
yanked
neale
to
his
feet
they
were
too
bunched
i
made
just
that
break
in
the
princeton
game
in
and
i
never
forgiven
myself
if
you
spilled
the
interference
your
end
would
have
got
the
runner
watch
the
ball
do
run
in
till
you
where
it
is
and
then
to
sometimes
you
can
tell
by
the
back
eyes
give
themselves
away
by
looking
where
they
going
to
go
but
an
old
hand
will
cross
you
on
purpose
the
knees
are
safer
mostly
they
lean
a
little
just
before
the
ball
goes
back
got
to
use
old
head
bill
morley
himself
could
stop
a
play
if
he
did
know
where
it
was
ah
the
stuff
that
was
just
right
not
too
soon
or
too
late
and
see
how
easy
it
was
day
after
day
the
wall
street
wrestled
with
neale
latent
acuteness
and
forced
it
into
action
with
shame
with
praise
with
reproach
and
enthusiasm
he
drew
out
of
neale
more
than
neale
had
dreamed
could
be
there
if
one
even
one
of
the
teachers
of
english
or
greek
or
chemistry
or
economics
had
taught
neale
as
this
wealthy
young
barbarian
taught
him
if
neale
had
given
even
a
tenth
as
much
attention
to
any
of
his
courses
neale
clambered
up
over
himself
raging
with
hope
up
over
his
first
realization
that
there
was
infinitely
more
to
this
problem
than
he
had
ever
supposed
over
his
next
that
he
did
not
know
even
the
rudiments
of
the
game
he
had
thought
he
knew
so
well
over
his
occasional
glimmers
of
understanding
why
he
failed
sometimes
and
succeeded
at
other
times
over
an
increasing
percentage
of
successes
and
finally
stood
a
little
giddy
with
the
new
height
on
the
peak
towards
which
atkins
had
urged
him
where
he
waited
strong
confident
behind
the
tackle
hoping
the
next
play
would
come
his
way
the
play
did
come
his
way
the
varsity
tried
out
against
the
scrub
its
new
delayed
pass
from
close
formation
to
the
left
it
worked
very
well
but
when
they
tried
it
to
the
right
neale
dropped
rogers
for
a
loss
three
times
in
succession
the
look
on
atkins
face
was
glory
the
next
afternoon
neale
was
back
on
the
varsity
and
biffy
on
the
scrub
there
was
a
pang
in
his
beatitude
a
painful
moment
of
generous
distress
when
biffy
came
up
to
congratulate
him
the
two
young
savages
gripped
each
other
hands
in
an
inexpressive
silence
and
each
saw
deep
into
the
other
big
heart
as
he
was
rarely
in
all
his
life
thereafter
to
look
into
any
other
human
being
inner
chamber
biffy
carried
it
off
splendidly
neale
thought
but
he
could
fool
a
man
who
had
just
been
there
himself
he
felt
sorry
for
biffy
he
remembered
to
be
sorry
for
biffy
till
the
whistle
blew
for
the
annapolis
game
chapter
xxvii
after
the
thanksgiving
game
a
great
peace
a
time
a
period
of
unconscious
adjustment
and
assimilation
of
all
that
mass
of
experience
neale
moved
back
to
the
frat
house
rooming
with
harry
gregg
a
classmate
of
his
and
a
fine
fellow
thought
neale
even
though
not
athletic
he
and
gregg
had
chanced
to
take
much
the
same
courses
and
were
in
the
same
in
several
subjects
after
a
preliminary
stagger
or
two
like
a
man
coming
indoors
after
living
in
the
open
who
can
not
walk
across
the
room
without
tripping
over
the
furniture
mind
settled
down
to
his
studies
he
found
them
rather
more
interesting
than
he
had
expected
a
course
in
general
european
history
especially
held
him
and
he
gave
much
more
time
to
the
outside
reading
prescribed
than
he
would
have
confessed
to
any
member
of
his
frat
except
gregg
who
took
it
as
a
matter
of
course
he
encountered
some
personalities
there
who
held
him
and
about
whom
he
often
thought
big
figures
who
dwarfed
the
life
around
him
when
they
stood
up
beside
his
study
table
cromwell
was
one
and
garibaldi
another
but
they
were
not
all
soldiers
wise
old
scouts
like
sully
oxenstierna
and
plombal
who
did
the
real
work
and
let
the
kings
and
potentates
prance
around
in
the
they
took
neale
fancy
too
they
were
the
boys
for
him
he
used
to
sit
back
and
laugh
to
himself
to
think
how
much
more
they
must
have
enjoyed
the
real
exercise
of
their
own
strength
than
the
silly
sovereigns
could
have
enjoyed
their
silly
as
for
henry
iv
and
he
reminded
neale
so
forcibly
of
mike
and
his
that
he
could
never
take
that
monarch
seriously
henry
of
navarre
made
him
laugh
at
mike
and
mike
made
him
laugh
at
henry
of
navarre
and
over
both
those
hilarities
neale
drew
the
decent
veil
of
his
calm
stolidity
one
day
browsing
around
in
the
library
he
saw
the
title
of
one
of
the
books
miss
austin
had
spoken
of
the
summer
before
one
of
the
books
neale
had
pretended
to
know
and
had
never
heard
of
he
drew
it
out
it
was
richard
feveral
and
read
it
entranced
until
early
the
next
morning
after
that
he
looked
up
one
by
one
all
the
books
she
had
mentioned
and
read
them
some
with
delight
some
with
blank
incomprehensiveness
some
with
scorn
he
killed
a
lot
of
time
discussing
things
in
general
with
gregg
reading
gregg
books
he
fell
especially
hard
for
a
worn
volume
of
poems
and
ballads
for
six
weeks
he
was
convinced
that
swinburne
had
said
the
last
word
a
blighting
word
on
ethical
values
then
one
day
he
noticed
that
his
favorite
credo
from
too
much
love
of
living
from
hope
and
fear
set
free
could
be
sung
to
the
tune
of
the
extremely
coarse
and
very
unpoetical
song
called
some
die
of
drinking
whiskey
some
die
of
drinking
beer
and
it
occurred
to
him
suddenly
that
when
you
thought
about
it
both
expressed
the
same
philosophy
it
was
disgusting
it
was
argument
but
just
the
same
it
somehow
put
a
crimp
in
swinburne
he
went
back
to
his
history
and
economics
but
you
could
stew
over
your
books
all
day
long
he
drifted
more
or
less
with
billy
innocuous
set
outwardly
he
passed
as
a
good
fellow
a
passable
mixer
though
rather
silent
inwardly
he
had
given
up
his
pose
of
horatian
calm
it
work
not
for
him
he
found
himself
very
much
alone
and
friendless
the
other
men
on
the
football
squad
well
they
had
been
his
during
the
season
but
after
the
season
they
were
mostly
illiterate
young
rakes
without
a
single
mental
spark
even
when
they
were
drunk
as
for
pete
hilliard
crowd
and
their
ways
of
amusing
themselves
hell
neale
felt
for
them
the
amused
scorn
of
the
dweller
for
the
uneasy
provincial
who
thinks
he
can
hide
his
provincialism
best
by
assuming
a
boisterous
nastiness
for
the
first
time
neale
began
to
wonder
about
himself
to
wonder
what
sort
of
a
human
being
he
was
anyway
that
he
did
seem
to
fit
in
really
with
any
crowd
there
was
always
so
much
of
himself
left
over
shut
out
from
companionship
left
in
the
dark
alone
and
silent
while
with
a
little
corner
of
himself
he
danced
and
talked
to
girls
and
drank
and
played
poker
and
talked
to
gregg
for
there
was
an
immense
lot
of
which
he
never
spoke
even
to
gregg
for
instance
they
never
talked
about
girls
and
neale
was
thinking
a
good
deal
about
girls
when
he
read
his
breath
came
and
went
fast
he
felt
tingling
all
over
he
longed
to
put
out
his
hand
and
open
the
door
into
the
wonders
and
marvels
that
lay
beyond
it
he
drew
back
from
the
fear
of
failure
of
making
a
fool
of
himself
at
an
unfamiliar
game
but
he
never
feared
that
there
was
nothing
beyond
the
door
at
dances
sometimes
he
stood
aloof
trying
to
look
byronic
to
save
himself
from
looking
wistful
sometimes
he
danced
steadily
always
with
a
calm
exterior
beneath
which
weltered
a
confused
mass
of
bewildered
uncertainties
and
longings
that
rose
choking
to
his
very
throat
and
yet
not
a
word
of
it
could
he
ever
get
out
what
was
it
he
was
missing
moody
out
of
humor
with
the
bright
warm
may
sunshine
he
put
the
question
to
himself
as
he
sauntered
aimlessly
down
the
library
steps
why
he
was
missing
everything
that
made
life
worth
while
was
he
always
to
live
alone
with
most
of
him
hidden
and
silent
would
he
never
find
his
crowd
or
at
least
one
other
person
to
meet
whom
he
could
go
forth
all
of
him
light
and
free
without
the
ball
and
chain
of
his
endless
reticences
other
fellows
seemed
to
find
something
satisfying
in
life
why
not
he
was
it
his
fault
or
life
that
he
walked
in
inner
blackness
he
was
framing
a
sweeping
indictment
of
life
as
he
passed
the
gate
to
south
field
somebody
ran
out
and
grabbed
him
by
the
neck
a
tall
senior
crown
playing
the
deutscher
verein
he
explained
speed
up
and
get
in
crit
get
your
coat
off
never
mind
your
togs
you
got
to
catch
next
inning
purdy
ca
hold
the
ball
if
i
put
a
hop
on
it
and
the
dutchies
are
swatting
my
slow
curve
there
you
go
that
the
third
out
get
busy
give
me
one
finger
for
a
fast
one
two
for
an
out
and
the
closed
fist
for
the
drop
the
pessimistic
philosopher
exiled
to
eternal
solitude
shed
coat
and
collar
put
on
mask
and
mitt
a
ball
a
strike
a
high
foul
as
he
sprinted
behind
the
to
get
under
it
neale
sloughed
off
the
parched
skin
of
introspection
from
that
time
on
he
forgot
everything
but
the
game
he
rattled
off
encouragement
to
the
pitcher
keep
workin
old
man
make
him
hit
it
got
him
swinging
wild
he
improvised
wild
flights
of
kidding
to
get
the
goat
of
one
batter
after
another
after
the
game
when
he
and
his
pitcher
were
shaking
hands
and
grinning
at
each
other
he
became
aware
of
berkley
and
berkley
girl
what
was
her
name
he
met
her
at
the
junior
ball
oh
yes
miss
wentworth
they
stopped
to
congratulate
him
neale
was
conscious
wretchedly
unphilosophically
conscious
of
a
very
dirty
face
a
more
than
dirty
shirt
and
torn
trousers
but
miss
wentworth
did
seem
to
notice
perhaps
she
was
a
good
sport
it
was
conceivable
that
a
girl
might
be
she
made
a
sensible
comment
on
the
double
play
which
had
saved
the
game
in
the
eighth
why
she
was
intelligent
as
well
as
neale
fell
into
step
forgetting
his
disheveled
looks
and
walked
along
to
the
at
street
where
they
all
had
sodas
he
met
her
again
that
spring
in
the
of
the
street
station
of
all
prosaic
places
he
had
stopped
in
for
a
to
see
about
getting
up
to
west
adams
and
she
was
evidently
waiting
for
a
train
he
touched
his
cap
she
smiled
he
stopped
to
pass
the
time
of
day
vacation
almost
here
he
said
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
she
inquired
he
hesitated
she
would
understand
but
he
was
never
very
good
on
quick
bluffs
and
so
said
briefly
i
got
to
learn
to
kick
this
summer
to
kick
a
football
i
mean
i
i
play
football
a
little
she
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
oh
you
need
explain
i
know
you
play
i
a
regular
fan
i
have
missed
a
home
game
in
three
years
and
i
read
the
athletic
news
mcalpine
graduates
so
does
johnstone
there
nobody
left
at
columbia
who
can
punt
so
you
to
learn
more
power
to
you
i
come
and
root
for
you
next
autumn
he
took
with
him
to
west
adams
a
mental
picture
of
a
strong
capable
body
in
a
and
fluffy
yellow
hair
smiling
lips
laughing
honest
blue
eyes
he
carried
also
what
was
more
tangible
and
important
in
his
summer
plans
a
worn
brown
football
the
center
of
many
an
afternoon
battle
between
scrub
and
varsity
as
soon
as
he
was
installed
at
west
adams
he
went
to
work
the
spare
thin
grass
on
the
upper
meadow
had
been
cut
there
a
good
mile
neale
jogged
every
day
and
there
all
the
morning
he
practised
punting
booting
the
ball
high
and
far
racing
down
trying
to
get
to
it
while
it
was
still
bounding
then
kicking
it
back
again
experimenting
with
different
ways
of
holding
it
he
always
kicked
at
some
target
i
drop
that
on
the
stone
pile
he
would
say
to
himself
and
before
he
kicked
again
he
would
try
to
analyze
success
and
failures
he
no
longer
needed
an
atkins
to
spur
him
to
use
his
brains
by
eleven
pretty
well
he
would
jog
down
again
take
a
plunge
in
the
inlet
above
the
mill
pond
where
no
one
could
see
him
for
the
thick
growth
of
alders
and
come
in
to
luncheon
at
noon
cool
and
ravenous
in
the
afternoon
he
worked
at
the
mill
or
lay
round
and
read
he
had
brought
a
lot
of
books
up
from
college
in
his
trunk
but
nothing
seemed
to
fit
his
present
serious
régime
as
well
as
emerson
after
much
running
after
false
prophets
the
clear
brutal
sanity
of
the
essays
was
as
refreshing
and
tonic
as
the
plunge
into
the
icy
clear
water
of
the
inlet
he
found
in
them
too
what
had
escaped
him
at
the
first
reading
an
austere
sonority
in
the
best
passages
let
those
fear
who
will
the
soul
is
in
her
native
realm
and
it
is
wider
than
space
older
than
time
wide
as
hope
rich
as
love
pusillanimity
and
fear
she
refuses
with
a
beautiful
scorn
they
are
not
for
her
who
putteth
on
her
coronation
robe
and
goeth
out
through
universal
love
to
universal
power
he
rolled
it
under
his
tongue
it
beat
about
his
ears
like
the
low
dignified
threat
of
distant
thunder
one
saturday
in
august
a
little
before
his
twentieth
birthday
something
happened
which
cast
a
long
ray
of
light
back
on
neale
life
it
began
by
the
great
surprise
of
seeing
father
and
mother
drive
up
to
the
house
in
a
buggy
from
the
village
it
was
perfectly
evident
from
the
moment
they
set
foot
in
the
house
that
there
was
something
in
the
air
but
being
a
crittenden
neale
father
was
in
no
haste
to
say
what
it
was
and
waited
to
explode
his
till
dessert
time
as
they
were
eating
the
peaches
and
which
grandmother
served
to
honor
their
arrival
then
it
came
out
we
been
doing
a
pretty
big
business
in
cabinet
woods
lately
father
began
looking
at
no
one
in
particular
cocobolo
rosewood
lignum
vitæ
mahogany
the
selling
end
is
all
right
but
it
a
job
to
get
the
stuff
delivered
the
firm
has
made
up
its
mind
that
it
will
pay
to
send
a
man
through
the
west
indies
and
central
america
to
look
the
production
end
over
get
options
sign
contracts
for
regular
yearly
delivery
there
a
big
territory
to
cover
the
field
goes
as
far
south
as
brazil
it
take
a
couple
of
years
at
least
maybe
three
or
four
telling
you
all
this
because
they
offered
the
job
to
me
and
mother
and
i
have
about
decided
to
accept
mother
looked
hard
at
neale
as
father
announced
this
and
they
both
waited
to
see
what
he
would
say
neale
was
so
astonished
at
the
idea
of
his
stationary
father
and
mother
being
anywhere
but
in
the
house
on
union
hill
that
he
found
nothing
to
say
for
a
moment
staring
at
them
then
he
said
it
was
the
first
thing
that
came
into
his
head
but
what
will
you
do
with
the
house
all
those
things
mother
said
eagerly
oh
we
could
rent
it
furnished
we
already
have
a
good
offer
for
it
well
what
do
you
think
about
that
exclaimed
neale
in
a
stupid
astonishment
at
the
idea
that
somebody
else
could
live
in
their
house
he
went
on
eating
his
peaches
and
thinking
about
it
in
silence
since
he
saw
no
reason
why
his
opinion
on
the
subject
was
of
any
interest
to
anybody
it
did
not
dawn
on
him
till
afterwards
when
he
and
father
took
a
stroll
along
the
that
father
and
mother
wanted
to
how
he
felt
about
it
and
would
not
do
it
if
he
very
much
disliked
the
idea
of
having
no
home
nearby
this
astonishing
fact
became
apparent
to
him
along
with
another
matter
even
more
astonishing
that
apparently
the
union
hill
house
had
been
arranged
largely
for
his
benefit
so
that
he
could
have
the
stability
of
a
home
atmosphere
we
always
wanted
to
roam
rather
explained
his
father
casually
we
were
pretty
young
when
we
married
your
mother
was
only
twenty
and
i
was
we
had
talked
a
good
deal
of
cutting
loose
and
seeing
the
world
but
well
you
were
born
the
first
year
afterwards
and
we
thought
probably
there
would
be
other
children
it
seemed
better
to
put
it
off
settle
down
till
we
had
raised
our
family
though
you
turned
out
to
be
the
only
one
in
the
twilight
of
the
maples
neale
was
doing
some
thinking
mother
had
been
when
she
was
his
age
with
all
her
life
before
her
and
she
never
had
a
bit
of
it
till
now
only
union
hill
and
more
union
hill
and
father
too
he
murmured
something
muffled
and
inarticulate
which
made
no
particular
sense
to
the
ear
but
which
father
understood
and
answered
with
some
vehemence
no
great
scott
neale
do
think
that
heavens
no
i
did
mean
sacrificed
anything
for
you
we
just
got
into
a
rut
the
way
people
do
and
stayed
there
so
long
we
began
to
think
we
could
get
out
and
now
when
this
opportunity
comes
your
mother
wanted
to
make
it
all
right
with
you
that
all
your
mother
and
i
you
been
a
great
comfort
to
us
we
do
want
he
was
almost
as
muffled
and
inarticulate
as
neale
but
neale
understood
him
and
reaching
for
his
hand
gave
it
a
hard
grip
he
did
not
try
to
say
anything
now
the
two
men
silent
under
the
old
maples
that
had
sheltered
their
childhood
exchanged
a
quick
glance
of
understanding
and
affection
nearer
to
each
other
now
at
the
moment
of
parting
than
ever
before
then
they
went
back
to
the
house
silent
as
iroquois
and
neale
went
in
to
where
his
mother
was
playing
dreamily
on
the
old
piano
to
tell
her
bluntly
that
he
would
not
in
the
least
mind
their
leaving
union
hill
since
he
could
be
at
home
very
little
in
any
case
during
his
senior
year
she
turned
around
on
the
piano
stool
to
listen
to
his
sober
statement
and
to
look
at
the
great
fellow
towering
up
over
her
yes
you
grown
up
now
neale
are
you
she
said
faintly
putting
a
hand
out
towards
him
and
he
knew
he
had
hurt
her
by
his
bluntness
and
yet
it
was
the
truth
he
told
her
and
also
what
she
wanted
to
hear
he
could
not
take
it
back
but
he
did
stoop
to
her
and
take
her
in
his
big
arms
for
a
hug
father
came
in
then
and
they
lighted
the
lamp
and
tried
to
talk
a
little
about
what
neale
was
going
to
do
to
earn
his
living
when
he
graduated
they
had
often
tried
to
talk
of
that
but
they
never
got
very
far
and
no
farther
this
time
than
any
other
neale
had
no
ideas
on
the
subject
and
being
neale
he
would
not
imaginatively
play
up
to
what
was
expected
of
him
and
say
he
had
no
he
did
not
feel
that
he
would
like
to
be
a
doctor
no
certainly
not
a
lawyer
he
would
mind
engineering
but
the
old
grads
in
his
frat
who
were
engineers
seemed
to
have
a
way
of
turning
up
out
of
a
job
every
once
in
so
often
he
did
think
much
of
a
profession
where
you
were
so
entirely
at
the
mercy
of
people
with
money
it
was
too
much
like
being
a
turtle
that
had
to
wait
for
somebody
to
turn
it
over
before
it
could
go
on
its
way
father
looked
at
him
rather
queerly
and
remarked
that
he
find
it
difficult
to
get
any
work
in
the
modern
world
where
he
would
be
at
the
mercy
of
people
with
money
neale
said
he
thought
very
pertinently
grandfather
never
has
been
father
looked
as
though
he
considered
this
mere
arguing
for
the
sake
of
arguing
and
said
something
drily
looking
around
at
the
plain
old
countrified
room
about
neale
not
being
willing
to
live
as
his
grandfather
had
two
generations
ago
the
upshot
of
the
talk
was
as
it
always
was
that
they
agreed
once
more
to
let
things
run
on
and
perhaps
something
would
turn
up
the
next
morning
father
and
mother
went
back
to
new
york
to
finish
the
preparations
for
their
adventure
mother
cried
a
little
when
she
kissed
neale
but
grandmother
kissed
her
son
without
a
quiver
though
she
clung
to
grandfather
arm
she
and
grandfather
and
neale
and
old
si
and
jennie
stood
in
the
front
yard
looking
after
the
carriage
it
was
almost
like
seeing
a
newly
married
pair
go
off
after
the
wedding
neale
mother
kept
turning
to
look
back
at
them
her
april
face
like
a
bride
colored
through
tears
by
excitement
and
anticipation
neale
stood
up
taller
than
his
tall
old
grandfather
now
broad
massive
his
tanned
face
like
a
man
but
to
his
amazement
there
awoke
in
his
heart
for
the
last
time
a
little
boy
a
little
boy
who
was
frightened
and
grieved
at
being
left
alone
down
the
hill
the
carriage
stopped
and
they
saw
neale
mother
spring
out
and
run
back
up
the
hill
beckoning
to
neale
forgot
something
conjectured
grandfather
neale
bounded
down
towards
her
they
met
between
the
carriage
and
the
house
mother
face
was
still
wet
with
her
tears
but
she
was
not
crying
now
a
glory
was
on
her
tremulous
face
neale
never
forgot
how
she
looked
at
that
moment
there
was
something
she
was
trying
to
tell
him
and
although
all
she
could
bring
out
as
she
took
his
big
hands
in
hers
was
neale
dear
dear
neale
she
knew
by
the
look
on
his
face
that
she
had
told
him
the
little
boy
in
neale
heart
appeased
consoled
comforted
melted
away
forever
without
bitterness
without
regrets
the
young
man
looked
down
at
his
mother
with
an
absolute
trust
in
her
love
and
a
robust
confidence
in
himself
i
be
all
right
mother
dear
he
told
her
heartily
meaning
a
great
deal
more
than
he
said
then
she
went
back
to
her
husband
and
neale
went
back
to
his
punting
as
he
ran
furiously
after
the
ball
reeking
with
sweat
under
the
brazen
august
sun
it
came
to
him
suddenly
so
that
he
stopped
short
for
an
instant
to
think
of
it
wonderingly
that
he
had
never
seen
his
father
and
mother
look
at
each
other
except
with
affection
and
besides
this
old
old
knowledge
which
had
hung
there
so
long
he
had
never
seen
it
before
there
was
a
new
picture
the
animation
and
excitement
on
their
faces
as
they
talked
of
their
setting
off
together
for
distant
travels
the
gaiety
of
mother
laugh
as
they
told
of
the
fun
they
were
having
to
make
ready
for
the
unknown
to
get
the
right
clothes
to
learn
spanish
i
been
on
the
point
of
buying
a
mantilla
she
had
said
do
you
think
i
would
look
well
in
a
mantilla
neale
mother
had
never
seemed
half
as
young
to
neale
as
now
she
must
have
been
an
awfully
nice
girl
he
thought
going
soberly
to
recover
his
ball
chapter
xxviii
although
he
had
of
late
seen
very
little
of
home
and
had
occasionally
felt
irked
to
know
that
his
parents
expected
him
to
make
a
appearance
there
neale
found
new
york
rather
queer
and
empty
at
first
with
no
background
whatever
but
the
football
house
he
encountered
something
of
the
same
queer
gone
feeling
as
he
lined
up
in
the
first
game
of
the
season
with
all
of
the
trusted
old
guard
disappeared
with
no
tod
mcalpine
beside
him
on
whom
to
leave
the
responsibility
for
the
outcome
of
events
of
all
the
old
supermen
in
whom
he
had
put
his
trust
only
marshall
the
captain
was
still
there
at
right
guard
things
looked
black
to
neale
such
raw
beginners
could
never
hold
together
against
any
seasoned
team
and
yet
they
did
week
after
week
of
the
early
season
they
registered
victory
after
victory
never
with
sensational
scores
but
with
steady
defense
that
kept
their
goal
line
uncrossed
with
drive
enough
to
punch
out
a
of
their
own
it
came
to
neale
slowly
that
this
was
no
kid
team
after
all
it
had
about
the
usual
proportion
of
seasoned
players
and
recruits
only
now
he
was
one
of
the
old
timers
it
came
to
him
also
that
bunny
edwards
the
soph
quarter
was
obviously
trusting
in
him
as
he
used
to
trust
in
tod
mcalpine
at
first
it
was
horrifying
to
neale
to
have
some
one
depending
on
he
had
all
he
could
do
to
stand
up
under
his
own
responsibility
heavy
on
his
own
shoulders
for
the
first
time
presently
he
realized
that
possibly
tod
mcalpine
had
had
his
own
secret
misgivings
too
in
the
days
when
neale
depended
on
him
it
was
by
no
means
wholly
physical
and
muscular
the
hardening
and
maturing
that
went
on
in
neale
those
first
weeks
of
his
last
football
season
this
deepening
of
his
sense
of
responsibility
deepened
his
capacity
for
emotion
along
with
the
rest
of
his
personality
the
other
seniors
even
good
old
gregg
theorizing
and
spinning
talk
about
things
he
read
in
books
seemed
off
in
another
world
to
neale
a
light
bright
boyish
somewhat
foolishly
unreal
although
very
world
but
although
he
sometimes
groaned
at
the
fierce
stark
suffering
which
was
the
inevitable
penalty
of
caring
so
fiercely
and
starkly
about
anything
as
he
cared
about
football
he
did
not
envy
gregg
and
the
other
outsiders
envy
them
heavens
no
they
were
playing
at
life
he
was
living
yes
he
was
living
and
at
a
higher
emotional
pitch
than
he
had
ever
known
he
did
not
think
of
himself
as
an
individual
he
was
flesh
of
one
flesh
bone
of
one
bone
with
his
teammates
once
in
the
amherst
game
a
smash
into
the
line
had
piled
up
without
gain
the
heaped
mass
of
legs
and
bodies
squirmed
itself
apart
friends
and
enemies
crawled
to
their
position
all
but
one
and
that
was
the
big
slav
tackle
who
lay
limp
and
white
as
if
dead
time
out
neale
flung
himself
against
fate
he
fell
on
his
knees
beside
the
prostrate
man
and
took
the
bullet
head
into
his
arms
mike
he
pleaded
not
now
need
you
mike
like
a
mother
with
a
baby
lying
between
life
and
death
he
hung
over
that
coarse
bruised
face
all
the
love
he
had
ever
felt
for
any
one
seemed
shallow
compared
to
his
yearning
over
this
debauched
hairy
boozer
he
could
have
kissed
the
ugly
blue
mug
as
the
eyelids
flickered
the
color
came
back
and
the
giant
rolled
to
his
feet
and
lumbered
back
into
the
line
the
season
rolled
along
the
luck
seemed
finally
to
have
changed
they
were
almost
through
with
the
best
record
in
years
then
two
days
before
the
final
game
marshall
the
captain
broke
a
bone
in
his
foot
the
faces
of
the
team
were
grave
all
but
that
of
dodd
the
sub
thus
let
into
the
varsity
as
they
gathered
in
the
before
the
game
the
coach
looked
them
over
casting
about
for
the
right
note
and
had
the
inspiration
to
lay
by
his
usual
impassioned
florid
appeal
nicholson
will
play
center
he
began
his
plain
heavy
words
like
iron
burke
and
dodd
guards
mike
and
larsen
tackles
greenway
and
huggins
ends
edwards
quarter
crittenden
and
wallace
halves
bascomb
crittenden
will
act
as
captain
he
looked
full
at
crittenden
it
the
last
time
you
wear
the
blue
and
white
neale
crittenden
neale
throbbed
like
a
great
brazen
bell
struck
by
the
hammer
andrews
turned
his
eyes
on
the
team
and
made
the
rest
of
his
speech
short
and
hard
boys
it
easy
to
lose
and
it
hard
to
win
do
be
fooled
by
the
rooters
saying
you
made
a
game
fight
what
you
do
run
away
take
it
from
me
there
a
time
in
every
game
when
either
team
can
win
it
the
team
that
has
the
sand
that
got
the
guts
to
put
in
an
extra
pound
that
wins
i
not
telling
you
this
cornell
team
is
easy
they
damned
hard
but
you
got
weight
enough
you
got
speed
enough
you
know
football
enough
now
you
go
out
there
on
the
field
and
show
me
you
got
guts
enough
to
win
with
set
jaws
and
grim
resolute
hearts
the
team
neale
at
their
head
trotted
out
on
the
gridiron
it
the
last
time
you
wear
the
blue
and
white
neale
crittenden
he
was
clanging
to
that
note
they
were
lucky
to
get
through
the
first
half
with
a
clean
slate
cornell
came
fast
and
hard
but
time
after
time
they
held
them
and
punted
out
of
danger
the
ten
minutes
intermission
seemed
to
last
barely
ten
seconds
and
they
were
at
it
again
swaying
from
one
line
to
another
looks
like
a
barring
a
fluke
thought
neale
and
then
with
an
angry
throb
of
alarm
by
god
i
believe
we
letting
up
here
where
we
put
in
that
extra
pound
six
the
quarter
was
droning
no
cried
neale
change
that
it
was
his
own
straight
buck
and
he
went
into
the
line
with
a
headlong
hurdle
give
the
signals
for
a
play
or
two
bunny
he
called
to
the
quarter
as
they
lined
up
again
he
barked
and
took
the
ball
on
a
cross
buck
rolling
and
plunging
for
four
yards
again
he
started
on
the
cross
buck
bluffed
at
receiving
the
ball
hit
the
defense
head
down
yelling
help
me
and
just
as
he
fell
saw
wallace
skirting
outside
of
tackle
with
the
delayed
pass
the
end
shaking
off
the
defensive
quarter
and
on
for
a
good
ten
yards
as
he
got
up
neale
grabbed
edwards
round
the
neck
and
whispered
with
lips
close
to
his
ear
we
got
started
bunny
you
run
the
plays
now
get
the
idea
shoot
outside
till
they
open
up
then
plug
billy
and
mike
through
the
guards
keep
mixing
up
and
speed
bunny
got
the
idea
he
snapped
out
his
signals
and
shot
his
offense
like
a
boxer
hammering
a
groggy
opponent
with
mike
back
he
ran
neale
and
wallace
outside
inside
across
on
the
weak
side
then
suddenly
dropped
back
to
straight
football
and
sent
mike
at
the
apex
of
a
straining
stamping
tandem
straight
through
and
over
the
defense
to
the
fifteen
yard
line
the
team
was
crazy
with
success
prancing
like
stallions
come
on
boys
neale
went
a
yard
on
a
straight
buck
dug
his
in
as
he
fell
plunged
and
squirmed
for
another
yard
and
a
half
wallace
shot
through
a
quick
opening
for
three
with
larsen
back
and
first
down
billy
sheered
off
inside
for
a
couple
of
yards
the
swede
got
another
two
straight
ahead
mike
running
from
position
made
only
a
bare
yard
but
enough
first
down
to
the
line
to
go
said
the
referee
neale
heard
his
signal
damn
the
torpedoes
go
ahead
he
thought
he
flew
at
the
line
bone
and
muscle
transfigured
by
flaming
will
a
hard
body
dove
against
his
knees
he
staggered
leaned
forward
churned
his
knees
up
and
down
a
tenth
of
a
second
that
seemed
to
drag
for
an
hour
forward
he
staggered
strained
forward
then
fell
when
the
mass
got
off
him
he
found
he
had
got
to
the
line
give
it
to
me
again
he
whispered
passing
bunny
larsen
stuck
his
blonde
head
close
up
to
theirs
for
christ
sake
let
take
it
it
my
last
game
i
wo
play
no
more
after
neither
will
i
thought
neale
but
he
nodded
and
they
lined
up
with
larsen
back
look
out
for
a
funny
one
cried
the
cornell
quarter
as
the
signals
began
cap
and
quarter
had
a
consultation
as
the
center
fingers
contracted
for
the
neale
shot
out
of
his
tracks
and
crashed
into
the
defensive
half
got
him
he
thought
remembering
as
they
both
went
down
to
swing
his
feet
wide
in
the
hope
of
getting
the
defensive
quarter
as
well
he
rolled
clear
at
once
and
looked
back
to
see
if
he
could
be
of
any
help
it
necessary
practically
all
the
two
teams
were
heaped
in
a
human
haystack
from
the
base
of
which
emerged
a
grinning
blonde
face
under
the
face
were
two
huge
hands
some
six
inches
over
the
line
clutching
the
ball
on
which
emotional
swedish
eyes
were
weeping
beatific
tears
neale
kicked
a
fairly
easy
goal
the
trainer
let
him
suck
a
little
water
from
a
sponge
whispering
out
of
the
corner
of
his
motionless
mouth
andy
says
minute
and
a
half
to
play
hold
the
ball
and
line
up
slow
but
the
team
had
tasted
too
much
blood
to
stall
they
went
down
on
the
like
a
pack
of
they
smashed
two
plays
for
a
loss
and
after
a
punt
they
punched
the
ball
to
midfield
before
the
whistle
blew
and
the
game
was
over
nicholson
tossed
the
ball
to
neale
here
your
ball
cap
neale
saw
mike
blahoslav
kissing
bunny
edwards
he
himself
was
hugging
gus
larsen
when
the
pandemonium
from
the
struck
them
he
was
lifted
on
a
platform
of
shoulders
and
carried
to
the
gate
surrounded
by
a
cheering
singing
crazy
mob
of
rooters
that
so
he
thought
there
a
crowd
looking
on
he
had
not
thought
of
the
bleachers
or
heard
a
cheer
since
the
second
half
began
they
packed
into
the
varsity
inside
scrub
on
top
the
went
off
at
a
gallop
for
a
few
blocks
the
rooters
ran
along
throwing
cigarettes
and
cigars
through
the
windows
neale
leaned
back
and
luxuriously
lit
a
cigar
he
had
been
thinking
about
that
first
cigar
for
the
last
month
oh
faugh
it
tasted
hot
and
dry
and
burned
his
mouth
no
matter
he
threw
it
away
and
leaned
back
in
a
golden
reverie
would
he
ever
again
know
such
blessed
unalloyed
content
probably
not
chapter
xxix
the
end
of
the
football
season
was
a
door
slammed
in
neale
face
forever
he
had
given
four
years
of
his
life
to
football
flung
them
joyfully
and
proudly
to
feed
the
sacred
flame
now
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
was
to
be
shut
out
from
the
temple
of
the
only
religion
which
had
as
yet
been
offered
him
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
was
no
atkins
to
hang
enviously
and
piteously
about
watching
other
men
doing
the
real
thing
neale
did
not
find
this
realization
tragic
because
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
the
common
lot
and
he
had
a
poor
opinion
of
those
who
cry
out
melodramatically
against
the
common
lot
the
thing
to
do
was
to
accept
the
common
lot
without
undignified
comment
so
he
did
not
give
a
latin
groan
nor
cry
out
a
russian
curse
on
destiny
when
he
woke
to
the
knowledge
that
the
aim
of
his
life
had
been
taken
away
that
he
had
lived
the
last
of
his
homer
he
set
his
jaw
and
began
to
try
to
adjust
himself
to
the
life
without
any
goal
which
he
was
henceforth
to
share
with
the
rest
of
the
but
the
days
seemed
very
long
and
empty
none
the
less
in
spite
of
his
grim
refusal
to
complain
into
the
middle
of
one
of
these
empty
days
dropped
a
note
from
miss
wentworth
dear
crittenden
now
that
you
can
stoop
to
earthly
affairs
wo
you
go
palisading
with
a
party
of
us
next
saturday
say
we
take
the
boat
from
the
first
thing
he
noted
next
saturday
was
that
berkley
was
not
of
the
party
he
still
thought
of
miss
wentworth
as
berkley
girl
and
he
was
annoyed
at
the
pleasure
he
felt
in
finding
her
the
second
thing
was
that
she
never
did
anything
to
block
his
manoeuvering
to
break
up
group
formation
and
string
out
the
party
two
by
two
neale
and
miss
wentworth
being
the
important
two
but
that
might
very
well
be
only
because
she
wanted
to
talk
football
she
had
seen
all
the
home
games
knew
the
players
names
and
for
a
girl
remembered
an
astonishing
number
of
the
more
spectacular
plays
the
morning
passed
quickly
at
noon
they
huddled
around
their
on
the
edge
of
the
cliffs
ate
broiled
bacon
sandwiches
and
drank
coffee
then
they
started
back
on
the
last
stretch
of
the
road
when
the
other
girls
began
to
tire
miss
wentworth
still
swung
along
unflagging
and
neale
saw
to
it
that
he
was
by
her
side
they
ran
out
of
athletic
reminiscences
she
ventured
hesitatingly
on
books
and
her
uncertain
face
cleared
when
neale
chimed
in
enthusiastically
she
surprised
to
find
a
football
man
who
got
beyond
munsey
thought
neale
no
he
had
read
the
egoist
but
richard
feverel
was
and
was
harry
richmond
a
racy
crazy
sort
of
tale
did
she
know
the
second
mrs
tanqueray
he
grinned
internally
with
an
amused
cynicism
remembering
for
whom
he
had
crammed
up
on
this
line
but
he
felt
a
difference
when
she
spoke
about
henry
james
he
admitted
frankly
that
he
never
heard
of
him
there
was
an
honest
quality
about
miss
wentworth
that
made
it
seem
underhanded
and
unnecessary
to
bluff
silent
they
stopped
where
the
road
pitches
steeply
down
to
the
river
speech
seemed
impertinent
when
the
hudson
lay
below
vast
and
mystic
in
the
december
dusk
then
the
rest
of
the
party
came
up
shrieking
out
oh
did
he
neale
saw
miss
wentworth
home
to
the
door
of
her
apartment
house
street
just
off
the
drive
he
noted
the
number
of
the
apartment
and
found
it
again
a
good
many
times
in
the
months
to
come
there
were
other
things
which
helped
fill
the
void
left
by
football
one
of
these
quaintly
enough
was
many
electives
were
open
to
seniors
neale
had
chosen
rather
at
random
philosophy
ethics
anthropology
english
lit
and
modern
history
there
was
really
nothing
whatever
to
do
now
with
his
time
except
study
and
to
his
surprise
those
courses
which
had
been
but
names
printed
in
the
catalogue
turned
out
very
much
alive
once
neale
began
to
put
his
mind
on
them
another
interest
was
what
he
called
with
pretended
scorn
it
amused
neale
to
poke
fun
at
gregg
pretensions
to
being
an
intellectual
but
he
liked
and
admired
his
none
the
less
their
room
came
to
be
the
favorite
of
all
the
speculatively
minded
of
their
acquaintance
and
neale
was
surprised
to
find
how
many
there
were
of
them
who
liked
as
much
as
he
and
gregg
to
discuss
things
in
general
every
friday
evening
unless
there
was
a
dance
or
an
athletic
contest
from
ten
to
two
some
of
the
gang
would
haunt
the
den
lolling
in
the
shabby
easy
chairs
and
on
the
beds
smoking
pipes
drinking
beer
and
spouting
out
all
they
knew
of
modern
thought
in
theory
the
meeting
was
open
to
all
shades
of
opinion
but
the
boys
were
without
exception
filled
with
the
painless
misanthropy
of
youth
afraid
of
nothing
except
appearing
priggish
by
which
they
like
many
other
people
meant
reasonably
carelessly
ready
to
agree
to
any
sweeping
indictment
of
mankind
this
although
their
youth
and
gloriously
perfect
digestions
made
them
serenely
confident
that
their
own
little
rafts
would
eventually
drift
to
a
smiling
harbor
in
the
country
of
easy
money
and
orange
blossoms
they
took
their
pessimism
as
they
did
their
beer
in
great
undiscriminating
gulps
which
affected
their
healthy
organisms
no
more
than
the
blowing
of
the
wind
with
it
they
drugged
their
bodies
swigging
away
heartily
at
both
narcotics
till
at
last
they
dropped
to
insensibility
only
to
crawl
out
from
under
the
table
the
next
morning
their
young
eyes
invincibly
bright
their
breaths
sweet
their
stomachs
indomitably
craving
good
food
finding
the
honest
winter
sunshine
flooding
in
at
the
windows
in
no
way
incompatible
with
the
flat
stale
beer
and
stinking
left
from
the
night
before
an
adult
might
have
drunk
of
the
bitter
waters
of
disillusion
with
more
caution
have
carried
his
load
of
pessimism
with
less
outward
unsteadiness
but
later
on
what
dead
fur
upon
his
tongue
what
a
sick
loathing
for
wholesome
fare
but
these
gilded
youth
swilled
down
each
his
kegful
of
nietzsche
and
turned
with
equal
zest
to
handfuls
of
like
the
cardinal
as
for
neale
he
joined
in
the
discussions
as
briskly
as
any
but
with
reservations
he
never
quoted
or
mentioned
emerson
although
he
thought
of
him
a
great
deal
he
never
discussed
anything
or
any
one
he
really
cared
a
snap
about
in
occasional
moments
of
insight
which
came
to
him
because
he
talked
less
babblingly
than
the
others
and
listened
more
he
suspected
that
all
the
other
slashing
young
radicals
and
iconoclasts
might
also
be
holding
back
secret
articles
of
faith
from
defilement
one
element
in
his
life
that
he
never
mentioned
to
the
gang
was
the
amount
of
time
he
was
spending
with
miss
wentworth
he
had
called
on
her
one
evening
shortly
after
the
palisading
trip
alleging
as
an
excuse
that
he
owed
her
a
dinner
call
for
the
picnic
lunch
she
had
provided
he
had
called
several
times
since
then
with
no
excuse
at
all
he
had
been
one
of
her
at
candida
and
somewhat
his
debt
by
taking
her
to
out
of
the
wilderness
and
barnum
and
bailey
circus
he
had
dined
several
times
at
the
wentworth
apartment
discussed
the
republican
party
with
her
quiet
widowed
impressive
father
and
had
learned
to
leave
him
in
peace
with
his
evening
post
after
dinner
miss
wentworth
kept
up
on
her
college
athletics
and
neale
took
her
to
the
games
the
dual
gym
meet
with
yale
the
hockey
games
the
indoor
track
meet
at
the
regiment
armory
she
had
a
great
passion
for
walking
so
they
walked
in
the
afternoons
along
riverside
drive
in
central
park
along
the
driveway
by
fort
washington
point
by
the
time
the
ice
had
broken
up
in
the
spring
neale
had
discovered
two
things
first
that
miss
wentworth
was
not
like
any
other
girl
he
knew
she
did
flirt
was
piqued
if
he
was
silent
he
felt
no
impulse
to
bluff
or
before
her
she
was
more
like
another
fellow
than
a
girl
only
a
very
much
more
attractive
fellow
than
he
had
ever
met
the
secondary
discovery
which
alarmed
as
well
as
thrilled
him
was
that
if
three
days
passed
without
his
seeing
her
he
found
himself
missing
her
very
much
indeed
meanwhile
the
were
long
past
spring
almost
at
hand
the
tongues
of
the
gang
after
all
the
winter
practice
wagged
more
freely
than
ever
the
first
friday
in
april
elliott
came
in
pulling
from
the
deep
pocket
of
his
a
bag
of
limes
and
a
bottle
of
gin
and
announcing
something
better
than
beer
for
that
evening
it
up
to
you
kid
neale
ordered
robertson
the
whom
they
tolerated
because
his
airs
amused
them
you
the
youngest
beat
it
to
the
and
bring
back
as
many
siphons
as
you
can
carry
after
the
rickeys
were
mixed
the
cheese
cut
the
set
out
the
tongues
began
to
clack
and
the
resounding
generalities
to
unroll
themselves
before
the
fresh
gaze
of
those
young
eyes
dazzled
by
the
brilliance
of
their
explorations
into
the
nature
of
things
elliott
was
saying
wisely
laws
everybody
knows
that
laws
are
a
conspiracy
among
mediocrities
to
keep
the
strong
from
taking
too
much
property
he
let
this
soak
in
and
went
on
and
moral
systems
are
similar
conspiracies
to
prevent
monopolies
of
less
tangible
things
elliott
delighted
in
polysyllables
which
he
did
not
as
yet
always
handle
with
entire
accuracy
gregg
who
did
not
like
either
polysyllables
or
elliott
commented
on
this
what
book
did
you
get
that
out
of
and
what
the
moral
the
moral
is
that
morals
are
a
sham
man
obeys
the
law
only
because
he
is
afraid
of
the
but
a
free
spirit
does
mind
the
criticism
of
mediocrities
he
glories
in
it
so
he
feels
all
right
does
he
asked
gregg
when
he
clears
out
to
canada
with
the
contents
of
the
safe
or
his
best
friend
wife
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
feels
like
a
dirty
dog
oh
but
that
is
just
force
of
habit
cowardice
before
convention
shucks
you
fellows
are
on
the
wrong
track
broke
in
brown
all
man
really
cares
about
is
his
three
meals
a
day
that
what
makes
the
world
go
round
when
the
wife
was
stolen
he
went
on
the
warpath
for
the
same
reason
a
cowboy
lynches
a
because
he
afford
to
lose
valuable
property
now
the
modern
woman
is
no
longer
an
asset
but
a
liability
he
paused
so
filled
with
admiration
for
his
own
metaphor
struck
out
in
the
heat
of
discussion
that
he
could
not
go
on
great
cæsar
ghost
that
was
so
bad
he
have
to
remember
that
in
the
next
theme
he
wrote
gregg
was
disposing
of
him
sardonically
oh
yes
we
know
soaking
up
the
economic
interpretation
of
history
like
a
sponge
have
a
mind
of
your
own
brown
you
do
have
to
believe
all
your
tells
you
what
do
think
crit
neale
sailed
cautiously
a
little
nearer
his
real
thought
than
he
usually
ventured
with
the
casual
comment
well
there
do
seem
to
be
some
things
a
man
ca
bring
himself
to
do
no
matter
how
much
he
wants
to
i
wonder
if
maybe
it
is
just
inherited
warning
us
off
from
what
bad
for
man
in
the
long
run
brown
came
back
for
revenge
oh
yes
we
know
the
rest
what
that
but
the
anthropology
course
have
a
mind
of
your
own
as
a
matter
of
fact
pleasure
the
only
motive
elliott
laid
down
the
final
dictum
every
time
you
do
something
you
do
it
because
rather
if
you
did
you
do
something
else
some
one
brought
out
another
profundity
deep
enough
to
match
this
affirming
oh
of
course
everything
relative
and
this
was
still
so
new
an
aphorism
to
them
that
they
let
it
alone
the
party
breaking
up
over
a
last
round
of
weak
rickeys
squeezed
from
the
bottle
neale
waited
till
he
saw
gregg
deep
in
venice
preserved
then
he
opened
a
small
volume
and
shielding
it
from
any
random
glances
of
his
began
reading
the
last
ride
together
chapter
xxx
the
two
had
passed
a
long
evening
together
miss
wentworth
father
was
attending
the
annual
banquet
of
the
american
philological
association
and
the
young
people
left
to
themselves
had
dined
downtown
at
the
lafayette
it
was
their
first
meal
alone
together
all
the
more
intimately
alone
because
of
the
shifting
crowd
of
strangers
about
them
how
natural
it
had
seemed
to
look
across
the
table
and
see
miss
wentworth
there
as
natural
as
though
he
could
look
forward
to
an
endless
succession
of
days
together
yet
so
tinged
with
romance
that
even
the
banalities
of
their
had
vibrated
with
emotional
significance
when
dessert
and
coffee
and
neale
cigar
could
be
dragged
out
no
longer
they
had
strolled
side
by
side
up
deserted
lower
fifth
avenue
now
they
were
standing
silent
watching
the
periodical
rise
and
fall
of
the
gushing
fountain
in
madison
square
at
first
the
pool
lay
quiet
then
the
surface
was
troubled
then
swelling
mounting
the
jet
of
water
burst
through
and
shot
upward
to
sink
again
leaving
only
waning
ripples
behind
it
it
made
the
young
man
think
of
a
great
many
things
which
were
none
the
less
moving
and
poignant
to
him
because
they
have
moved
every
thoughtful
human
being
since
the
beginning
of
time
as
he
looked
gravely
down
on
the
pulsations
of
the
gleaming
water
it
symbolized
to
him
the
rhythm
of
the
universe
the
recurrent
rhythm
of
the
generations
human
life
with
its
one
little
spurt
of
youth
and
glory
sinking
so
soon
so
fatally
soon
to
the
sterile
routine
movements
of
age
but
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
as
casually
as
ever
there
a
fountain
in
rome
he
said
where
if
you
throw
a
coin
in
you
sure
to
come
back
to
it
i
wonder
if
it
would
work
with
this
one
i
did
know
you
ever
been
in
rome
i
have
i
got
that
out
of
crawford
roma
what
makes
you
so
anxious
to
come
back
to
madison
square
i
not
i
rather
find
a
fountain
that
would
send
me
round
the
world
but
there
is
much
chance
of
that
and
i
thought
if
you
throw
one
in
too
both
at
the
same
time
you
know
it
might
fix
things
so
that
come
back
together
she
gave
him
a
steady
thoughtful
look
took
a
penny
out
of
her
purse
all
ready
go
the
two
coins
splashed
into
the
pool
i
hope
there
will
be
as
lovely
a
moon
then
as
there
is
she
said
i
wonder
thought
neale
just
how
much
she
meant
by
that
when
neale
got
back
to
his
room
the
gang
was
not
there
in
full
force
only
robertson
the
knowing
little
soph
and
gregg
drinking
beer
and
smoking
their
pipes
neale
kept
back
a
grimace
of
distaste
at
seeing
robertson
his
broad
boy
face
set
in
its
usual
expression
of
solemn
wiseness
in
the
ways
of
the
world
the
rest
of
the
gang
found
robertson
comic
and
enjoyed
having
him
around
to
laugh
at
as
many
people
enjoy
a
visit
to
the
in
a
zoo
and
see
nothing
but
the
comic
in
the
humanness
of
simian
antics
but
he
disquieted
neale
to
his
very
soul
as
another
set
of
people
are
disquieted
and
troubled
by
a
visit
to
the
and
see
nothing
to
laugh
at
in
simian
antics
one
evening
of
little
robertson
and
his
disillusion
with
the
world
and
the
human
race
moved
the
rest
of
the
gang
to
delighted
howls
of
laughter
for
days
afterwards
but
though
neale
laughed
with
the
rest
nobody
could
help
laughing
at
robertson
he
was
such
an
owl
it
rather
took
the
shine
off
schopenhauer
and
pessimism
and
that
was
a
real
privation
for
a
senior
as
he
came
in
gregg
was
quoting
but
sweet
as
the
rind
was
the
core
is
we
are
fain
of
thee
still
we
are
fain
o
sanguine
and
subtle
dolores
our
lady
of
pain
neale
lifted
a
stein
from
its
hook
poured
it
full
from
the
pitcher
and
took
a
long
drink
go
ahead
johnny
he
said
sounds
lovely
like
any
other
fairy
tale
fairy
tale
cried
little
robertson
fairy
tale
you
puritan
that
all
know
you
been
neglecting
your
opportunities
neale
answered
sharply
puritan
be
damned
i
no
earl
hall
christer
i
know
swinburne
enough
sight
better
than
you
do
at
the
sight
of
robertson
round
eyes
goggling
at
him
under
his
bulging
forehead
he
was
amused
at
his
own
annoyance
and
taking
another
drink
went
on
indifferently
all
i
saying
is
maybe
prostitution
was
a
dainty
art
in
ancient
greece
or
maybe
swinburne
knew
some
high
class
practitioners
but
here
in
new
york
on
the
heights
maybe
the
thought
of
becky
blumenthal
without
her
shimmy
gives
you
an
æsthetic
thrill
but
if
it
does
you
got
a
stronger
stomach
than
i
have
take
it
from
me
kid
if
you
want
any
poetry
out
of
all
that
you
better
stick
to
swinburne
yep
agreed
gregg
i
with
you
crit
i
do
like
the
professionals
they
a
mercenary
crew
they
for
the
stuff
and
if
you
ai
got
enough
biff
kerslap
out
you
go
why
does
some
gay
little
lady
just
looking
for
a
good
time
give
us
the
high
sign
the
way
they
do
in
books
does
she
she
does
not
the
subject
of
the
discussion
pleased
robertson
immensely
of
course
but
he
was
outraged
at
the
narrowness
of
his
elders
views
he
got
up
languidly
put
on
his
cap
and
standing
by
the
door
pronounced
judgment
all
women
said
little
robertson
the
belong
to
the
trade
more
or
less
in
one
way
or
the
other
i
wo
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
every
woman
has
her
price
only
have
never
met
one
who
had
neale
and
gregg
gazed
at
him
he
turned
away
calling
airily
over
his
shoulder
well
ta
ta
a
may
night
no
time
for
debates
going
out
for
a
stroll
on
morningside
to
prove
my
theory
after
they
had
had
their
laugh
out
gregg
said
does
he
think
he
a
heller
wants
to
think
so
grunted
neale
where
all
the
gang
oh
some
of
them
are
boning
for
the
exams
and
some
are
chasing
chippies
and
billy
peters
is
off
on
some
of
his
usual
footless
fussing
been
calling
on
a
girl
all
winter
and
i
do
believe
he
even
had
his
arm
around
her
yet
except
at
dances
the
kid
neale
filled
his
pipe
held
the
match
over
it
and
puffed
gently
until
the
tobacco
glowed
an
even
red
all
over
the
top
what
would
gregg
say
he
wondered
to
his
attitude
towards
miss
wentworth
and
gregg
himself
neale
knew
perfectly
well
gregg
wrote
long
weekly
letters
to
that
girl
whose
picture
stood
on
the
dresser
over
there
he
also
knew
perfectly
well
that
gregg
was
a
regular
sir
galahad
when
it
came
to
her
oh
lord
how
like
that
blatant
idiot
robertson
they
were
it
made
him
feel
like
a
fool
kid
himself
the
bluff
they
always
kept
up
were
they
getting
enough
to
drop
this
hypocrisy
he
kept
all
this
to
himself
smoking
in
thoughtful
silence
when
the
pipe
was
finished
he
yawned
and
stretched
guess
i
turn
in
going
to
read
all
night
gregg
looked
up
from
his
book
i
put
the
shade
over
the
light
so
you
can
get
to
sleep
i
want
to
finish
this
philosophy
a
stuff
republic
have
you
read
the
last
book
yet
it
great
dope
the
next
day
neale
and
miss
wentworth
were
sitting
by
their
little
gipsy
fire
in
a
nook
among
the
palisades
overlooking
the
river
luncheon
had
long
been
finished
the
dishes
packed
away
and
they
continued
to
sit
still
miss
wentworth
looking
at
the
view
neale
looking
at
her
and
turning
over
in
his
mind
the
problem
how
can
a
man
with
no
money
and
no
prospects
of
ever
earning
any
ask
a
girl
to
marry
him
he
ca
but
suppose
there
a
chance
that
the
girl
well
no
matter
what
she
may
be
thinking
would
it
be
the
decent
thing
to
let
her
know
how
he
feels
of
course
he
ought
to
what
the
answer
then
there
is
any
answer
a
penny
for
your
thoughts
mr
crittenden
i
was
wondering
neale
lied
glibly
whether
you
did
know
me
well
enough
to
stop
calling
me
mr
crittenden
she
met
his
eyes
squarely
all
right
i
call
you
neale
if
call
me
martha
i
hate
formality
between
friends
he
weighed
her
intonation
carefully
had
she
accented
the
word
friends
did
she
mean
it
as
a
warning
well
whether
or
not
she
meant
it
that
was
the
only
line
he
could
decently
take
as
they
started
on
the
walk
back
to
the
ferry
their
talk
dodged
personalities
they
talked
about
the
trees
and
rocks
and
and
books
and
music
the
music
to
which
martha
had
been
introducing
neale
that
winter
the
music
which
little
by
little
was
beginning
to
speak
to
his
heart
more
powerfully
more
directly
even
than
poetry
then
gradually
with
a
deep
sense
of
tranquil
comradeship
they
stopped
dodging
personalities
no
longer
felt
any
need
to
talk
strode
forward
side
by
side
silent
each
sure
of
the
other
neale
felt
quiet
and
happy
and
at
the
same
time
miserable
and
uncertain
could
he
find
words
to
tell
her
must
he
in
honor
wait
till
he
had
a
place
in
the
world
to
offer
at
the
end
of
their
long
march
they
came
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
stood
for
a
long
time
staring
down
at
the
great
river
shimmering
and
iridescent
far
below
them
in
the
spring
haze
only
a
few
miles
further
south
along
these
cliffs
and
only
a
few
years
ago
the
little
neale
had
sat
alone
and
swung
his
feet
and
dreamed
how
simple
life
had
been
for
him
then
still
without
a
word
they
went
down
the
path
to
the
ferry
landing
and
stood
waiting
for
the
boat
it
was
very
still
except
for
the
water
splashing
on
the
stony
beach
without
thought
without
planning
it
the
fullness
of
neale
heart
unsealed
his
lips
he
began
to
speak
in
a
low
tone
his
voice
rough
and
uneven
with
emotion
listen
you
hear
the
grating
roar
of
pebbles
which
the
waves
draw
back
and
fling
at
their
return
up
the
high
strand
he
was
aware
that
the
girl
was
very
still
listening
with
bent
head
sophocles
long
ago
heard
it
on
the
ægean
and
it
brought
into
his
mind
the
turbid
ebb
and
flow
of
human
misery
we
his
breath
failed
him
and
he
was
silent
over
there
beyond
that
wide
expanse
of
lapping
water
lay
the
world
with
its
houses
and
railways
its
business
its
of
human
relations
here
in
the
shadow
they
were
alone
together
but
now
i
only
hear
its
melancholy
long
withdrawing
roar
retreating
to
the
breath
of
the
down
the
vast
edges
drear
and
naked
shingles
of
the
world
he
stopped
now
that
he
had
come
to
what
he
wished
to
say
he
dared
not
do
you
know
the
rest
asked
the
girl
softly
yes
said
neale
huskily
i
know
it
she
waited
for
him
to
go
on
and
when
he
did
not
she
said
well
no
matter
i
know
it
too
she
stood
beside
him
in
the
blue
twilight
her
fair
head
raised
her
eyes
looking
far
over
the
water
neale
was
certain
that
she
too
was
silently
repeating
ah
love
let
us
be
true
to
one
another
for
the
world
which
seems
to
lie
before
us
like
a
land
of
dreams
so
various
so
beautiful
so
new
hath
really
neither
joy
nor
love
nor
light
nor
certitude
nor
peace
nor
help
for
pain
and
we
are
here
as
on
a
darkling
plain
swept
with
confused
alarms
of
struggle
and
flight
where
ignorant
armies
clash
by
night
the
great
day
was
over
the
yew
tree
had
been
planted
and
orated
over
the
scared
valedictorian
had
stumbled
through
as
much
of
his
speech
as
he
could
remember
neale
with
a
hundred
other
seniors
had
stood
up
and
received
the
degree
of
bachelor
of
arts
which
the
president
scattered
broadcast
over
them
neale
was
through
with
college
college
was
through
with
neale
father
and
mother
were
there
come
up
specially
from
the
other
side
of
the
equator
though
father
tried
to
pretend
that
business
had
brought
him
north
they
strolled
about
the
campus
went
downtown
and
had
luncheon
together
all
three
outwardly
calm
in
the
traditional
crittenden
manner
in
spite
of
the
emotion
boiling
under
the
surface
of
their
little
family
party
what
boiled
hardest
under
neale
surface
was
a
great
haste
to
find
his
place
in
the
to
begin
to
make
money
to
have
something
to
offer
martha
before
he
had
met
martha
he
had
had
dreams
of
asking
to
go
back
to
college
for
a
master
degree
in
anything
just
to
go
on
with
the
studies
he
had
found
so
interesting
to
play
football
again
to
sit
smoking
his
pipe
and
talking
philosophy
with
gregg
but
even
in
his
dreams
he
had
felt
that
all
that
was
only
a
little
scheme
to
dodge
real
life
and
now
he
felt
no
sympathy
with
dreams
he
wanted
to
get
out
and
tackle
real
life
with
all
his
strength
he
smarted
under
the
feeling
that
he
had
no
right
to
speak
to
martha
so
when
mother
went
up
to
her
room
to
rest
from
the
strain
of
throttling
her
feelings
down
to
her
standard
of
outward
calm
and
he
and
father
went
into
the
lobby
to
light
cigars
he
said
at
once
father
i
want
to
start
in
to
hustle
for
a
job
father
looked
pleased
it
even
occurred
to
neale
that
father
looked
relieved
anything
special
in
sight
he
asked
no
i
just
going
to
knock
at
all
the
office
doors
till
i
find
one
where
they
do
throw
me
out
father
puffed
awhile
naturally
i
like
to
have
you
with
me
but
i
could
offer
you
anything
but
a
clerkship
and
i
convinced
that
the
opportunities
to
rise
are
greater
here
at
the
center
of
things
now
worked
a
good
many
years
for
the
firm
and
i
believe

may
neale
had
never
so
to
speak
received
any
letters
in
his
life
until
his
parents
had
gone
off
to
rio
but
since
then
letters
had
filled
what
personal
life
he
had
found
time
for
it
was
surprising
how
much
more
freely
people
spoke
out
in
the
written
word
than
in
talk
the
weekly
bulletins
from
mother
and
father
occasional
letters
gave
him
more
of
a
feeling
of
intercourse
with
his
parents
than
he
had
ever
known
when
they
lived
under
the
same
roof
and
he
was
sure
that
in
no
other
way
could
he
ever
have
come
to
look
into
the
clear
integrity
of
heart
as
he
had
in
the
letters
which
had
come
to
him
from
all
over
europe
where
she
had
been
wandering
with
her
father
during
his
sabbatical
year
of
freedom
in
the
april
after
his
graduation
martha
had
written
from
england
that
she
was
hurrying
the
end
of
her
so
that
she
could
be
home
to
take
a
palisading
walk
with
him
on
may
sixteenth
may
sixteenth
was
the
date
of
their
last
walk
together
on
the
palisades
the
walk
which
had
ended
in
the
sweet
wordless
understanding
between
them
her
frank
recognition
of
it
as
an
anniversary
to
be
remembered
showed
how
far
along
the
year
of
separation
and
frequent
had
brought
them
he
was
thinking
of
martha
the
wonderful
martha
her
letters
had
revealed
as
he
waited
for
her
on
may
sixteenth
in
the
parlor
of
her
father
apartment
he
found
it
almost
impossible
to
listen
to
what
professor
wentworth
was
saying
and
tried
in
vain
to
answer
the
traveler
questions
about
columbia
news
the
wentworths
had
been
in
norway
and
spain
and
england
and
greece
while
neale
had
not
been
out
of
new
york
but
he
knew
no
more
of
columbia
than
they
with
the
bestowal
of
the
impersonally
broadcasted
degree
columbia
had
dropped
him
as
unceremoniously
as
it
had
failed
to
welcome
him
when
he
arrived
and
quite
right
too
thought
neale
he
detested
the
florid
sentimentality
of
some
other
universities
the
maudlin
old
grads
singing
of
bright
college
years
so
he
knew
nothing
whatever
about
columbia
to
report
besides
professor
wentworth
naturally
enough
was
inquiring
about
what
had
been
happening
to
the
faculty
during
his
absence
and
neale
had
never
had
the
faintest
guess
that
any
of
his
professors
led
a
life
but
most
of
all
his
year
in
business
in
an
office
surrounded
by
men
who
had
never
been
near
a
university
had
set
him
immeasurably
far
from
the
academic
world
in
an
attempt
to
satisfy
martha
father
he
now
made
a
great
effort
to
look
back
at
college
life
but
he
was
looking
back
at
it
from
the
wrong
end
of
a
telescope
it
was
inconceivably
small
and
far
away
he
had
not
realized
till
now
how
much
the
year
in
business
had
changed
him
how
rapidly
he
had
left
behind
him
the
horizon
of
his
college
years
well
that
was
as
it
should
be
to
live
hard
in
the
present
without
brooding
over
the
past
or
dreaming
of
the
future
then
martha
came
in
and
he
forgot
college
altogether
forgot
professor
wentworth
he
even
forgot
the
business
world
as
he
looked
into
her
blue
eyes
the
same
but
oh
how
startlingly
more
real
and
alive
than
the
memory
picture
he
had
been
treasuring
all
those
months
they
crossed
the
ferry
they
stepped
off
briskly
up
the
path
then
when
the
last
house
was
hidden
behind
the
rocks
they
stopped
martha
lifted
her
smiling
face
to
his
as
their
lips
touched
neale
was
thrilled
by
a
wave
of
emotion
exaltation
rather
than
passion
how
dear
how
sweet
how
incredibly
pure
and
good
she
was
the
moment
passed
as
they
walked
on
from
time
to
time
their
eyes
met
frankly
oh
but
i
glad
to
be
walking
with
you
again
neale
said
martha
at
last
it
as
if
we
had
been
separated
at
all
yes
you
do
look
older
ever
so
much
older
and
yet
about
the
same
oh
i
just
the
same
martha
he
told
her
briefly
with
a
weighty
significant
accent
it
was
the
only
reference
made
by
either
of
them
to
what
was
in
their
hearts
but
it
was
enough
for
both
of
them
what
a
girl
neale
thought
not
to
want
any
more
than
he
did
a
lot
of
to
express
feelings
as
they
tramped
along
energetically
martha
was
talking
of
what
the
year
had
been
to
her
she
spoke
of
and
gothic
cathedrals
and
palaces
and
ruins
but
what
she
said
and
what
neale
heard
was
that
nowhere
had
she
met
any
one
whom
she
liked
better
than
neale
neale
felt
himself
relax
in
an
ineffable
content
and
knew
by
contrast
how
anxious
he
had
been
then
they
made
their
fire
and
cooked
their
bacon
ate
their
lunch
and
neale
lighted
his
pipe
peaceably
and
happily
they
sat
in
a
sunny
sheltered
corner
of
the
rocks
overlooking
the
river
their
hearts
sheltered
and
sunny
and
in
the
intervals
of
their
talk
they
looked
at
each
other
in
quiet
satisfaction
how
good
it
was
to
be
together
again
neale
report
of
his
year
took
longer
than
martha
because
they
both
felt
that
hers
had
the
irrelevant
passing
interest
of
a
while
his
was
to
have
enduring
importance
for
them
both
it
was
he
told
her
the
same
phase
in
the
business
world
as
a
freshman
year
in
college
and
although
he
had
not
made
a
brilliant
outer
success
as
yet
he
felt
on
the
whole
satisfied
with
the
way
he
had
got
his
feet
under
him
and
had
begun
to
know
his
way
about
he
gave
a
droll
little
color
to
the
account
of
his
job
in
the
office
the
one
they
had
evidently
given
him
as
an
experiment
to
be
tried
out
in
cheap
materials
first
he
representing
the
cheap
materials
the
business
had
grown
and
grown
at
first
a
generation
ago
the
product
of
gates
business
ability
later
on
too
large
even
for
what
the
old
man
could
keep
under
his
remarkably
capacious
hat
then
twenty
years
ago
other
people
gates
son
neale
father
the
clever
and
forceful
manager
of
the
chicago
office
a
in
ottawa
had
begun
to
keep
it
under
their
respective
hats
important
matters
were
decided
orally
in
a
personal
talk
between
the
different
department
heads
who
having
the
required
information
at
their
needed
no
figuring
or
statistics
to
help
their
decisions
this
had
lasted
all
the
while
neale
was
growing
up
but
by
the
time
he
graduated
some
of
the
younger
members
of
the
organization
had
begun
to
feel
that
perhaps
the
stock
of
information
vital
to
the
conduct
of
the
business
ought
to
be
copied
off
from
the
several
brains
which
possessed
it
and
set
down
in
some
more
accessible
form
belden
the
ottawa
manager
knew
all
about
the
lumber
market
in
eastern
canada
the
average
quality
of
spruce
in
each
section
and
what
the
chances
were
of
getting
it
on
time
for
a
given
order
gilman
at
the
chicago
office
could
snap
back
over
the
wire
any
question
you
cared
to
put
about
wisconsin
or
northern
michigan
lumber
regions
but
they
were
neither
of
them
so
young
as
they
had
been
nor
was
crittenden
whose
specialty
was
the
of
eastern
and
foreign
lumber
markets
even
the
young
gates
was
now
over
fifty
they
were
all
mortal
the
health
of
the
young
gates
was
far
from
good
and
furthermore
the
business
kept
steadily
growing
so
that
it
was
very
inconvenient
to
have
to
wait
to
consult
men
widely
separated
do
you
get
it
asked
neale
lying
in
the
sun
on
the
palisades
smoking
looking
up
at
a
sweet
face
and
delighting
in
her
eager
intelligent
interest
in
his
story
do
you
get
it
half
the
bunch
thought
a
the
foolishest
waste
of
time
half
of
them
did
know
whether
it
was
or
not
all
of
them
wanted
some
sort
of
tabulation
of
inside
information
and
none
of
them
knew
how
to
go
about
it
any
more
than
if
they
been
asked
to
bake
a
batch
of
bread
or
write
a
theme
on
the
crusades
the
half
that
wanted
to
stick
to
the
old
ways
and
keep
it
all
safe
under
different
people
hats
were
dead
set
against
spending
any
money
on
any
fool
system
of
collecting
and
classifying
information
and
the
other
half
were
by
any
means
so
sure
of
their
ground
that
they
wanted
to
spend
a
lot
of
cash
to
get
an
expert
and
anyhow
where
could
you
find
an
expert
if
you
let
one
of
those
people
inside
the
office
he
be
trying
to
run
the
whole
works
maybe
the
idea
was
all
right
but
you
could
get
it
executed
well
while
the
whole
proposition
was
up
in
the
air
and
everybody
chewing
the
rag
about
it
somebody
knocks
at
the
door
and
who
is
it
why
crittenden
son
just
out
of
college
wanting
a
job
all
nonsense
college
and
yet
what
it
have
taught
a
boy
if
not
how
to
straighten
out
and
classify
information
anyhow
you
could
get
him
for
next
to
nothing
boys
out
of
college
never
expect
to
be
paid
anything
to
speak
of
and
a
good
reason
why
because
they
are
worth
anything
give
him
a
year
try
at
it
crittenden
son
ought
to
have
a
natural
sense
it
wo
cost
much
he
ca
do
any
harm
maybe
he
might
work
out
a
system
that
would
be
useful
so
they
offered
the
job
at
slightly
more
than
wages
to
the
college
graduate
and
what
did
think
about
it
how
had
he
been
trained
for
such
work
know
martha
how
he
been
trained
what
he
knew
about
orderly
arrangement
of
information
was
about
what
would
go
on
the
head
of
a
pin
he
been
learning
a
scattered
items
about
english
literature
and
greek
philosophy
and
the
latest
inaccuracy
about
atoms
and
a
whole
lot
about
how
to
get
a
football
over
a
given
line
under
given
conditions
but
incidentally
and
on
the
side
he
had
a
pretty
thorough
course
in
poker
and
a
was
the
necessary
equipment
for
situation
he
and
martha
laughed
a
young
laugh
that
did
them
good
and
made
them
feel
closer
than
ever
to
each
other
in
the
conspiracy
of
two
against
the
world
the
rest
of
the
year
had
been
neale
told
her
a
slow
dogged
struggle
to
find
out
what
after
all
it
was
nobody
business
to
tell
him
to
invent
a
system
of
recording
what
he
found
out
that
would
not
only
be
but
to
collect
exact
statistics
as
to
the
cost
of
production
and
transportation
and
to
bring
together
items
of
that
had
never
before
had
even
a
speaking
acquaintance
with
each
other
i
traced
a
plank
from
the
tree
to
inch
by
inch
my
in
my
hand
setting
down
every
sixteenth
of
a
cent
per
board
foot
that
it
cost
till
we
sold
it
to
the
retail
dealer
watching
it
as
if
it
were
the
of
a
reigning
house
and
i
the
man
set
to
keep
track
of
him
i
covered
reams
of
paper
figuring
out
the
cost
of
the
of
getting
that
plank
sold
extra
you
know
not
ordinary
overhead
and
by
heck
i
do
see
how
they
ever
managed
to
run
their
old
business
a
minute
the
haphazard
way
they
been
going
at
it
nobody
knew
anything
not
of
anything
i
seem
to
have
been
marking
time
but
just
you
wait
till
i
get
out
of
the
office
and
into
the
real
game
i
know
more
about
some
things
than
any
of
the
buyers
even
the
well
there
must
be
a
big
profit
in
business
or
they
would
be
able
to
conduct
it
that
loose
way
said
martha
oh
the
profits
are
big
all
right
neale
concurred
old
man
gates
has
more
cash
than
he
knows
what
to
do
with
and
not
one
of
his
grandchildren
amounts
to
a
whoop
when
his
son
the
one
who
our
general
manager
now
retires
there
wo
be
a
gates
left
in
the
gates
lumber
company
they
wo
mind
said
martha
you
bet
your
life
they
wo
said
neale
far
from
it
most
likely
they
hardly
heard
the
name
of
it
they
all
living
in
europe
now
buying
villas
and
things
out
of
the
money
the
company
makes
our
gates
never
sees
any
of
his
family
except
when
he
takes
a
vacation
and
goes
to
florence
or
england
all
want
out
of
the
lumber
business
is
a
fat
wad
of
easy
money
that
not
right
said
martha
suddenly
that
not
right
it
not
right
if
getting
something
for
nothing
is
wrong
neale
agreed
casually
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
there
you
are
the
way
things
go
martha
made
no
answer
there
was
a
little
silence
then
she
said
all
that
that
detail
work
it
does
seem
so
terribly
interesting
to
me
neale
have
you
found
it
awfully
dull
sometimes
neale
rolled
over
and
sat
up
with
an
effect
of
entering
again
into
active
and
energetic
life
well
i
might
have
he
said
finally
but
you
know
martha
that
i
have
a
special
reason
for
wanting
to
get
on
quick
in
business
and
i
been
mighty
glad
enough
to
grab
hold
of
any
end
that
was
handy
he
smiled
at
her
confidently
all
a
fellow
needs
in
the
business
world
is
a
crack
in
the
wall
to
get
his
toes
into
for
a
start
i
got
my
crack
now
you
just
watch
me
climb
it
was
perfectly
understood
between
them
what
he
was
climbing
to
reach
chapter
xxxii
father
had
written
from
caracas
that
mother
was
taking
the
next
boat
back
to
new
york
because
she
needed
a
lot
of
dental
work
done
and
any
confidence
in
venezuelan
dentists
but
when
neale
met
mother
at
the
dock
she
told
him
at
once
laughingly
that
the
dental
work
was
only
an
excuse
and
that
she
had
come
to
have
a
visit
with
her
son
she
had
added
with
a
whimsical
defiance
that
such
being
the
fact
she
had
no
intention
of
putting
up
the
usual
crittenden
bluff
of
something
different
i
not
a
crittenden
she
told
neale
gaily
in
the
cab
on
the
way
to
the
hotel
though
i
married
into
the
family
so
young
and
now
that
worn
a
mantilla
with
a
rose
in
my
hair
i
not
going
to
try
any
longer
to
pretend
that
i
am
neale
looked
at
her
admiring
her
now
quite
distinguished
appearance
but
feeling
a
little
alarm
at
her
tone
she
sounded
almost
disturbingly
electric
i
come
up
to
have
a
real
new
york
spree
with
my
big
son
and
his
nice
girl
now
that
he
has
condescended
to
let
us
know
he
has
a
nice
girl
she
told
him
her
smiling
eyes
at
once
tender
and
a
little
mocking
you
can
afford
it
ca
you
since
your
last
raise
oh
i
can
afford
anything
in
reason
your
father
says
they
tell
him
you
getting
on
splendidly
they
never
let
on
as
much
to
me
said
neale
drily
though
they
are
treating
me
very
white
as
to
pay
they
were
at
the
hotel
door
now
where
mother
made
arrangements
for
a
stay
of
a
month
dental
work
takes
so
long
she
told
neale
gravely
in
the
elevator
making
him
laugh
outright
she
looked
very
well
pleased
at
this
and
after
they
were
inside
her
room
stood
up
on
and
gave
him
another
kiss
he
had
never
entirely
recovered
from
his
father
chance
remark
that
mother
had
been
only
twenty
when
she
married
she
must
have
been
about
as
old
as
he
was
now
when
he
first
began
to
remember
her
just
a
girl
and
she
had
seemed
older
to
him
then
than
now
he
told
her
this
as
he
unstrapped
her
valise
you
seem
younger
to
me
every
time
i
see
you
lots
younger
now
than
when
i
was
six
or
seven
years
old
she
laughed
out
i
was
a
child
myself
when
you
were
six
or
seven
she
turned
grave
for
a
moment
if
i
had
you
to
bring
up
now
that
i
am
a
really
grown
person
with
a
personality
of
my
own
and
some
experience
of
the
world
i
do
it
very
differently
i
make
a
better
job
of
it
you
made
a
good
enough
job
he
protested
mildly
how
can
you
look
at
me
and
think
you
could
have
done
any
better
she
stopped
her
unpacking
to
laugh
it
just
spoils
a
person
for
other
forms
of
joking
to
live
with
one
of
you
dry
crittendens
other
humor
seems
so
flamboyant
i
the
crittendens
she
pronounced
judicially
though
i
did
waste
about
twenty
years
of
my
young
life
trying
to
make
myself
into
one
i
glad
you
one
but
if
you
try
to
make
martha
into
one
martha
one
already
he
told
her
triumphantly
we
exactly
alike
the
way
we
think
and
do
things
that
why
we
get
on
so
well
together
at
this
neale
mother
looked
at
him
so
hard
that
he
felt
a
little
annoyed
and
turned
the
talk
back
to
its
earlier
channel
how
else
would
you
have
brought
me
up
i
like
to
know
i
have
taken
dynamite
to
you
she
informed
him
briskly
dynamite
oh
you
do
understand
and
i
daresay
it
would
have
been
too
early
anyhow
you
probably
get
your
share
of
dynamite
when
your
turn
comes
she
changed
the
subject
how
business
seriously
seriously
he
told
her
of
the
results
of
his
promotion
six
months
before
from
the
intelligence
bureau
as
he
called
it
to
the
real
business
of
life
to
buying
and
selling
the
only
real
money
is
in
that
he
told
her
warming
as
he
spoke
all
those
other
jobs
office
jobs
do
lead
you
anywhere
buying
and
selling
especially
selling
that
where
you
get
ahead
i
earning
twice
what
i
did
and
by
this
time
next
year
be
doing
twice
what
i
doing
now
i
may
soon
be
able
to
do
a
little
on
the
side
on
my
own
hook
pick
up
something
good
and
dispose
of
it
well
grandfather
is
sure
i
can
he
may
have
some
tips
for
me
later
on
grandfather
is
a
wise
old
scout
mother
laid
some
underwear
away
in
a
drawer
as
she
shut
it
she
asked
casually
do
you
read
any
emerson
nowadays
neale
how
in
the
world
did
mother
know
he
had
ever
read
emerson
no
i
do
he
said
she
noted
the
shortness
of
his
tone
with
raised
eyebrows
and
began
to
hang
up
her
dresses
in
the
closet
neale
looked
at
her
back
with
some
uneasiness
he
felt
his
privacy
threatened
and
stiffening
put
up
the
bars
and
apparently
mother
sensed
the
change
for
she
at
once
dropped
her
intimate
tone
and
began
making
gay
plans
for
having
some
fun
during
her
stay
plans
in
which
dental
engagements
played
a
conspicuously
small
part
it
turned
out
to
be
a
very
month
mother
month
in
the
dentist
chair
neale
and
martha
were
quite
shaken
up
out
of
the
quiet
routine
of
their
peaceful
days
and
long
evenings
of
serious
reading
together
mother
took
them
to
the
theater
and
to
dinner
at
restaurants
of
which
like
most
sober
resident
new
yorkers
they
had
never
heard
the
names
in
the
daytime
she
and
martha
of
whom
she
had
grown
very
fond
went
around
a
good
deal
together
looking
at
the
innumerable
expensive
and
occasionally
beautiful
objects
on
view
in
the
shops
of
a
big
city
or
visiting
museums
or
going
to
matinées
they
heard
a
good
deal
of
music
all
three
of
them
mother
had
chosen
a
hotel
near
carnegie
hall
so
that
frequently
when
they
had
nothing
else
to
do
they
strolled
up
on
foot
and
listened
to
whatever
was
being
played
they
had
an
occasional
dinner
with
professor
wentworth
and
martha
in
their
apartment
on
street
and
mother
went
off
by
herself
to
look
up
the
old
friends
of
union
hill
days
the
few
who
were
not
scattered
once
in
a
while
neale
talked
over
his
business
prospects
with
mother
when
she
asked
him
about
them
and
he
could
get
out
of
it
and
they
agreed
that
he
would
be
able
to
marry
in
another
year
and
having
agreed
in
this
opinion
mother
was
apt
to
fall
very
silent
for
a
time
but
this
suited
neale
who
found
intimate
personal
talk
disconcerting
it
always
made
him
uneasy
when
another
human
being
rattled
the
handle
of
the
door
to
his
inner
secret
garden
one
of
the
things
he
most
loved
in
martha
was
that
she
took
so
much
for
granted
without
talking
about
it
they
understood
each
other
instinctively
he
felt
without
need
of
explanation
he
suspected
that
martha
had
her
own
inner
garden
and
prided
himself
on
respecting
her
right
to
it
was
no
one
to
go
rattling
handles
of
doors
that
were
none
of
his
he
found
martha
especially
restful
and
satisfying
after
one
of
these
talks
with
mother
lightly
and
passingly
as
mother
glanced
over
those
sensitive
places
he
constantly
felt
that
mother
was
trying
to
open
a
door
he
wished
to
keep
shut
that
she
was
trying
to
say
something
that
he
had
no
desire
to
hear
he
and
martha
were
all
right
what
business
had
mother
to
look
at
them
that
way
she
did
nothing
after
all
beyond
looking
and
went
away
at
the
end
of
her
month
having
committed
no
greater
crime
than
to
whisper
brokenly
to
neale
as
she
kissed
him
neale
it
not
enough
to
neale
you
must
martha
you
must
her
not
just
at
this
neale
had
quickly
assumed
the
cold
look
of
distaste
which
she
knew
so
well
and
she
had
ventured
no
further
after
her
departure
neale
fell
with
relief
back
into
his
old
routine
of
quiet
comfortable
with
martha
with
none
of
the
prickling
electric
uncertainties
he
had
felt
in
mother
odd
how
much
better
he
knew
martha
than
he
did
mother
how
sure
he
was
beforehand
of
what
martha
would
think
and
say
whereas
he
had
been
uncomfortably
unsure
of
mother
he
felt
he
knew
martha
as
he
knew
himself
through
and
through
this
conviction
was
a
great
satisfaction
to
him
he
often
thought
of
it
with
pride
and
with
a
secret
pity
and
scorn
for
people
who
found
life
and
human
relationships
so
complicated
and
mysterious
that
sort
of
thing
was
just
a
convention
what
was
there
so
darned
mysterious
about
your
own
nature
about
a
sensible
nature
nothing
if
you
were
a
sane
normal
man
you
found
your
mate
in
the
world
just
as
normally
as
you
found
your
place
in
the
business
world
with
a
healthy
honest
fine
girl
like
martha
there
would
be
none
of
those
emotional
complications
you
read
about
in
books
he
was
away
from
new
york
a
good
deal
at
this
time
taking
as
one
of
the
younger
salesmen
the
more
difficult
and
less
remunerative
territories
and
when
he
came
back
to
the
city
it
was
like
coming
home
to
ring
the
bell
of
the
wentworths
apartment
and
have
martha
herself
come
to
open
the
door
for
him
her
eyes
as
clear
and
honest
as
sunlit
water
they
always
had
a
good
deal
to
tell
each
other
after
these
separations
martha
about
her
work
at
the
speyer
school
where
she
had
begun
to
help
a
little
in
visiting
the
families
of
the
poorer
children
neale
about
his
business
which
he
was
finding
more
and
more
absorbingly
interesting
for
which
he
was
feeling
much
of
the
zestful
passion
he
had
felt
for
football
he
talked
a
great
deal
to
martha
about
the
resemblance
of
football
to
business
one
of
the
many
things
he
loved
about
martha
was
her
knowledge
of
football
of
course
strictly
speaking
like
all
other
outsiders
she
knew
nothing
whatever
about
football
but
she
knew
as
much
as
any
spectator
could
and
brought
up
from
birth
as
she
had
been
in
one
or
another
college
community
she
had
a
familiarity
with
the
psychology
of
the
game
with
the
fierce
driving
concentration
the
eager
devout
willingness
to
devote
every
throb
of
your
pulse
every
thought
in
your
brain
to
winning
the
game
and
it
seemed
perfectly
natural
to
her
as
it
did
to
neale
to
step
into
another
world
where
all
the
mature
energies
were
focussed
in
the
same
way
it
just
like
football
neale
often
told
her
his
eyes
gleaming
having
played
football
gives
you
as
great
an
advantage
as
though
you
were
in
training
and
the
other
fellows
soft
i
often
feel
as
if
i
ought
to
go
and
look
up
old
atkins
and
thank
him
he
was
teaching
me
enough
sight
more
than
how
to
play
defense
that
everlasting
pounding
of
his
on
the
idea
of
knowing
where
the
ball
is
before
you
go
for
it
gee
whiz
you
never
guess
how
many
fool
mistakes
that
kept
me
from
i
see
the
other
fellows
wasting
money
on
buying
drinks
and
tickets
to
shows
and
champagne
suppers
for
old
buyers
who
have
an
interest
left
in
life
beyond
screwing
the
price
down
an
eighth
of
a
cent
wallowing
in
just
to
get
going
the
way
i
used
to
and
i
think
of
old
atkins
lie
low
keep
my
mouth
shut
and
size
up
the
enemy
formation
till
i
see
their
weak
place
the
brilliance
of
his
eye
the
grimness
of
his
set
jaw
the
impact
of
one
great
fist
in
the
palm
of
the
other
hand
showed
what
happened
then
he
went
on
one
game
just
like
the
other
and
the
thing
that
wins
in
both
is
to
more
than
the
other
fellow
does
he
turned
serious
almost
exalted
and
said
sometimes
i
used
almost
to
think
it
was
the
way
religion
must
be
for
people
who
believe
in
it
it
puts
you
in
touch
with
some
big
force
i
felt
it
in
football
i
guess
everybody
always
feels
it
who
really
gets
going
enough
to
care
about
anything
with
all
that
is
in
him
if
you
give
every
bit
of
yourself
do
keep
anything
back
want
to
win
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
why
all
of
a
sudden
some
outside
source
of
power
hundreds
of
volts
higher
than
normal
begins
to
flow
through
you
and
you
things
it
wonderful
but
you
ca
have
it
cheap
it
costs
you
all
you
got
one
evening
as
they
sat
thus
martha
perched
on
the
arm
of
chair
the
quiet
air
about
them
crackling
and
tingling
with
the
current
martha
caught
and
grasped
a
comparison
which
had
long
been
floating
elusive
in
the
back
of
her
mind
she
jumped
up
and
ran
to
the
piano
listen
it
like
this
she
told
him
and
played
with
one
hand
clear
and
defiant
and
compelling
the
call
of
the
young
siegfried
that
was
how
it
was
in
football
and
now
she
sat
down
before
the
piano
and
stretching
out
both
hands
over
the
keys
she
filled
the
room
with
the
rich
clamor
of
the
same
theme
reinforced
by
all
the
sumptuous
strength
of
harmony
neale
sprang
to
his
feet
you
know
what
siegfried
went
through
fire
to
find
he
cried
stooping
to
put
his
lips
on
martha
cheek
all
he
wanted
was
to
get
to
brunhilda
and
that
all
i
want
my
brunhilda
all
i
want
in
the
world
chapter
xxxiii
he
had
called
her
his
brunhilda
with
honest
sincerity
with
all
his
heart
he
thought
he
meant
it
of
he
was
fighting
for
success
to
put
in
martha
hands
his
honor
was
pledged
to
win
for
martha
sake
his
deep
affection
for
martha
underlay
his
delight
in
learning
to
play
the
game
all
this
went
without
saying
and
he
said
it
even
to
himself
with
less
and
less
frequency
during
the
next
year
he
had
as
a
matter
of
fact
less
and
less
time
and
strength
to
give
to
anything
outside
his
business
this
focussing
of
energies
began
to
have
its
usual
result
he
felt
the
eyes
of
the
older
men
in
the
organization
turned
on
him
with
curiosity
with
approval
and
with
a
little
jealous
alarm
which
gave
him
the
utmost
pleasure
he
saw
in
the
younger
eyes
the
appraising
combative
watchful
look
with
which
one
tackle
surveys
his
opponent
all
his
mystic
intensity
of
conviction
of
the
worthwhileness
of
winning
games
flared
and
blazed
hot
and
lusty
in
his
heart
as
he
recognized
that
he
was
now
head
over
ears
in
the
turmoil
of
the
biggest
game
he
had
yet
encountered
of
course
the
real
purpose
of
the
game
was
to
take
care
of
martha
that
was
axiomatic
the
middle
of
his
third
year
in
business
was
marked
by
a
considerable
raise
in
salary
and
an
enlargement
of
territory
with
corresponding
increase
from
sales
commissions
which
proved
conclusively
that
he
was
now
accepted
as
one
of
the
of
the
organization
and
when
barely
a
week
later
professor
wentworth
was
notified
of
his
appointment
as
exchange
professor
for
the
next
academic
year
to
one
of
the
german
universities
the
moral
of
the
two
events
was
clear
it
was
time
for
a
rather
long
engagement
to
end
time
for
martha
to
set
a
definite
date
for
the
wedding
before
her
father
departure
for
berlin
with
the
setting
of
the
date
the
relations
of
the
three
took
on
another
aspect
like
a
change
of
lighting
at
the
theater
everything
was
as
it
had
been
and
yet
everything
was
different
professor
wentworth
considered
himself
already
eliminated
by
the
younger
generation
and
although
they
invited
him
to
share
the
new
home
on
his
return
from
the
year
in
germany
he
assured
them
that
he
would
under
no
conditions
cumber
up
the
background
in
any
such
fashion
and
began
to
make
plans
for
joining
forces
with
another
widowed
professor
whose
children
were
now
all
married
his
resigned
philosophic
acceptance
of
his
exit
from
their
stage
set
them
further
from
him
and
closer
to
each
other
as
if
he
had
already
stepped
out
from
their
lives
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
they
occasionally
felt
a
little
awareness
of
being
alone
with
each
other
which
was
new
to
them
as
martha
quaintly
phrased
it
she
now
began
to
feel
not
only
that
she
was
engaged
but
that
she
was
going
to
be
married
the
feeling
was
a
new
one
gave
a
new
color
to
her
thoughts
and
sometimes
made
her
feel
a
little
queer
neale
told
her
that
he
understood
this
and
felt
with
her
that
he
was
stepping
forward
into
a
new
phase
of
their
relation
and
he
did
feel
this
at
intervals
but
while
this
was
the
only
change
that
had
occurred
in
martha
life
it
was
overshadowed
in
neale
by
his
intuition
that
he
had
now
come
to
a
crucial
moment
in
his
business
career
he
recognized
perfectly
the
feel
of
the
moment
in
the
game
when
one
side
or
the
other
wins
although
half
the
time
may
yet
remain
to
be
played
through
in
football
it
lasted
but
an
instant
that
poise
on
the
very
crest
of
the
in
business
it
would
last
he
had
no
idea
how
long
but
he
felt
that
he
had
been
well
coached
by
life
that
his
training
had
left
him
with
the
endurance
to
stick
it
out
years
if
necessary
his
pride
as
a
fighter
hardened
and
set
he
felt
again
the
passion
to
win
out
at
any
cost
to
himself
or
others
which
had
been
the
meat
and
marrow
of
his
football
days
in
short
he
began
to
be
considered
by
all
the
experienced
eyes
about
him
as
a
remarkably
promising
young
american
but
now
for
the
first
time
he
did
not
pass
on
to
martha
the
excited
exuberant
sense
of
triumphant
force
the
salty
tang
of
pushing
a
weaker
man
where
he
had
not
wished
to
go
nowadays
when
he
stepped
into
professor
wentworth
apartment
he
found
martha
with
excitements
and
interests
of
her
own
of
her
own
and
his
too
after
the
first
slightly
startled
recognition
that
he
had
opened
the
door
upon
a
quite
unexpected
scene
he
always
focussed
his
eyes
to
the
other
distances
and
discussed
as
animatedly
as
martha
the
relative
advantages
of
suburban
and
locations
and
looked
over
with
her
the
list
of
apartments
to
let
but
when
he
left
her
he
had
scarcely
reached
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
before
he
was
again
in
his
own
world
crouching
warily
with
tense
muscles
alert
to
catch
his
opponents
off
their
balance
he
occasionally
cast
a
mental
glance
back
at
the
scene
he
had
left
but
it
was
already
out
of
focus
as
a
matter
of
plain
fact
he
did
not
care
a
picayune
whether
they
lived
in
a
suburb
or
on
street
or
in
what
kind
of
they
kept
their
books
nor
whether
they
had
twin
beds
of
mahogany
or
white
enamel
he
told
himself
that
what
he
did
care
about
was
that
martha
should
be
suited
in
those
details
about
which
she
seemed
to
care
so
much
one
evening
he
found
even
as
he
was
with
her
his
attention
wavered
dimmed
and
fixed
itself
on
a
deal
he
was
planning
with
his
grandfather
a
small
affair
which
he
hoped
to
put
through
on
the
side
but
from
which
as
he
was
to
handle
it
by
himself
he
expected
quite
a
brilliant
percentage
of
profit
he
answered
martha
at
random
came
back
to
her
world
with
a
guilty
start
excusing
his
lapse
by
explaining
to
himself
that
he
was
eager
for
that
profit
only
because
it
would
considerably
add
to
the
sum
he
was
laying
by
for
the
equipment
of
the
new
home
as
he
sat
listening
to
martha
and
agreeing
with
her
and
at
the
same
time
speculating
about
the
age
and
condition
of
the
oak
on
the
tract
he
hoped
to
buy
and
how
much
of
it
was
big
enough
to
make
profitable
he
thought
whimsically
that
he
was
as
good
as
married
already
that
he
was
doing
just
what
was
done
by
all
the
husbands
he
knew
martha
stopped
suddenly
as
if
he
had
spoken
aloud
or
as
if
she
had
been
struck
by
a
new
thought
neale
do
you
realize
it
we
really
going
to
be
married
just
like
anybody
else
i
do
believe
i
ever
thought
we
really
would
did
you
he
said
i
always
had
a
sort
of
notion
we
would
but
although
this
was
not
the
first
time
she
had
expressed
this
feeling
something
about
her
accent
or
aspect
crystallized
into
tangible
form
anticipations
which
had
been
as
vague
in
his
case
as
in
hers
about
this
time
he
began
to
notice
that
instead
of
misty
glances
at
what
marriage
was
to
mean
came
concrete
definite
recurring
pictures
of
one
scene
after
another
in
the
life
before
them
his
imagination
never
very
quickly
aroused
or
very
flexible
by
nature
began
to
be
prodded
by
circumstances
into
an
unwonted
activity
on
the
subject
of
martha
and
this
marriage
he
saw
her
in
his
mind
eye
across
the
breakfast
table
on
the
other
side
of
the
hearth
or
even
sitting
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
with
his
arm
around
her
as
she
often
sat
now
while
they
talked
over
their
plans
but
it
was
one
of
the
first
intimations
he
had
of
the
storm
before
him
he
encountered
some
curious
dumb
resistance
deep
in
his
heart
when
he
tried
to
think
of
her
more
intimately
with
the
veils
of
girlhood
gone
as
his
wife
something
within
flashed
up
with
chivalric
swiftness
to
shut
out
such
thoughts
he
amazed
himself
once
or
twice
by
feeling
his
face
hot
as
though
with
shame
at
the
idea
of
making
martha
martha
whom
he
loved
so
much
his
wife
what
sort
of
morbid
prudery
was
this
as
soon
as
it
was
passed
he
found
it
incredible
and
felt
it
again
perhaps
it
was
so
incredible
after
all
maybe
that
was
the
price
you
paid
for
knowing
something
about
life
it
was
inevitable
what
must
be
felt
by
every
man
who
had
not
been
brought
up
in
a
vacuum
and
it
was
really
all
right
and
nothing
to
be
squeamish
over
human
nature
is
what
it
is
and
there
no
use
dressing
it
up
in
names
if
that
had
been
all
he
had
to
worry
him
but
there
were
other
things
more
than
once
he
had
felt
a
new
exasperation
rise
in
him
when
martha
would
go
on
discussing
the
color
of
and
hang
it
all
he
was
ready
to
agree
with
her
whatever
way
she
wanted
it
was
that
enough
without
dragging
him
into
a
discussion
of
details
he
did
understand
or
care
about
nothing
of
any
great
importance
such
passing
moments
of
impatience
and
yet
he
had
gloried
in
his
certainty
that
martha
and
he
agreed
on
everything
more
troubling
still
he
remembered
so
distinctly
the
first
time
bending
together
over
a
book
a
strand
of
martha
hair
had
touched
his
cheek
he
could
still
feel
the
shiver
with
which
he
had
drawn
away
true
he
had
not
realized
what
was
taking
place
had
felt
subconsciously
as
if
a
spider
were
walking
across
his
face
but
just
the
same
three
years
ago
though
he
might
have
recoiled
his
next
impulse
would
have
been
to
snatch
that
tress
of
hair
and
kiss
it
why
did
he
kiss
it
now
why
here
it
was
again
just
as
if
they
were
married
already
that
was
the
way
so
many
husbands
he
knew
acted
with
their
wives
of
course
all
this
was
to
be
expected
too
you
get
used
to
things
you
ca
go
on
being
thrilled
by
familiar
sensations
in
the
nature
of
things
marriage
could
not
be
as
transcendent
as
people
pretended
when
men
and
women
are
so
far
from
being
transcendent
and
yet
little
by
little
whenever
in
the
pauses
of
his
business
he
gave
a
thought
to
his
personal
future
he
felt
it
all
there
again
heavier
and
heavier
weighing
down
leadenly
every
thought
which
he
tried
to
send
ahead
into
the
life
he
meant
to
make
so
happy
for
martha
at
this
for
a
short
time
he
fell
into
an
inner
panic
lost
his
head
thought
himself
abnormal
incapable
of
ordinary
human
life
he
was
afraid
to
see
martha
and
was
in
his
heart
immeasurably
relieved
when
she
was
called
off
by
a
wedding
in
her
aunt
family
to
a
somewhat
lengthy
visit
in
ohio
he
wanted
to
have
it
all
out
with
himself
while
she
was
gone
make
an
end
of
all
this
nonsense
but
what
he
did
was
to
think
of
it
as
little
as
possible
with
martha
gone
he
was
able
to
occupy
his
mind
entirely
with
business
problems
and
the
release
from
tormenting
personal
worries
was
grateful
to
him
he
had
been
intensely
he
was
relieved
that
his
discomfort
was
passed
quite
passed
he
opened
martha
first
letter
with
pleasure
letters
were
all
right
they
did
harry
you
with
emotional
he
read
her
entertaining
account
of
the
prostrate
condition
of
both
families
over
the
elaborate
wedding
ceremony
impending
everybody
it
seemed
was
frantic
with
nerves
except
the
and
her
young
man
of
course
who
paid
no
attention
to
anybody
or
anything
but
themselves
neale
thought
he
felt
a
note
of
satire
in
this
and
smiled
appreciatively
that
was
exactly
what
felt
about
fussy
weddings
martha
always
felt
as
he
did
with
the
thought
an
inner
door
clanged
open
and
sickeningly
there
was
the
whole
thing
to
begin
again
what
if
martha
been
feeling
as
he
had
what
did
a
decent
girl
feel
before
her
marriage
anyhow
did
she
dread
it
perhaps
or
on
the
other
hand
had
she
too
lost
the
thrill
were
they
already
like
some
of
the
married
couples
he
knew
who
kissed
with
listless
lips
looked
at
one
another
with
stolid
glassy
eyes
no
martha
was
all
right
martha
would
change
but
did
that
make
it
worse
what
did
she
expect
to
find
in
marriage
could
he
give
martha
what
she
expected
to
find
in
marriage
he
had
never
once
before
thought
of
that
absorbed
as
he
had
been
by
his
own
disquiet
he
was
overwhelmed
by
this
new
complication
and
for
many
days
would
not
allow
himself
even
to
glance
at
it
he
hated
the
idea
of
thinking
about
it
he
hated
the
whole
idiotic
tangle
he
kept
getting
into
why
damn
it
getting
married
was
no
such
complicated
affair
look
at
all
the
imbeciles
who
sailed
into
it
a
vacuous
smile
on
their
lips
and
nothing
whatever
in
their
heads
and
made
a
success
of
it
a
man
was
a
woman
thank
god
and
could
be
expected
to
divine
what
a
woman
wanted
out
of
marriage
people
who
did
not
expect
too
much
of
it
or
of
anything
were
the
only
ones
with
intelligence
just
at
this
time
he
got
his
first
chance
at
a
big
order
an
industrial
suburb
was
projected
to
house
the
operatives
of
a
new
manufacturing
plant
in
the
connecticut
valley
the
contractors
had
never
been
gates
customers
and
no
one
in
the
office
thought
that
young
crittenden
had
the
ghost
of
a
show
of
landing
the
order
no
one
that
is
but
young
crittenden
himself
the
contract
would
run
up
into
the
millions
of
board
feet
forgetting
martha
marriage
every
personal
element
in
life
neale
started
after
it
he
studied
the
buyer
the
situation
the
sort
of
lumber
needed
he
sat
up
nights
going
over
the
architect
specifications
made
up
alternative
schedules
for
spruce
oak
yellow
pine
interior
trim
clear
or
grade
a
shingles
then
delving
deep
in
the
information
he
himself
had
collected
he
rechecked
his
figures
shaving
the
margin
of
safety
down
till
he
was
sure
his
bid
would
be
lower
than
any
other
firm
and
yet
safe
no
danger
of
leaving
the
firm
in
the
hole
the
gates
lumber
could
count
on
its
usual
percentage
of
profit
and
neale
crittenden
on
his
biggest
commission
yet
to
add
to
the
sum
he
was
laying
aside
for
the
new
home
when
his
bid
was
finally
in
the
contractor
hands
and
routine
office
and
road
work
threatened
to
leave
him
with
time
to
think
neale
turned
hastily
back
to
his
private
deal
with
grandfather
intimate
knowledge
of
all
the
possible
in
his
region
was
a
gold
mine
there
were
always
in
the
back
valleys
being
sold
for
taxes
or
for
very
little
because
all
the
older
generation
dying
off
the
western
heirs
did
not
care
enough
about
the
little
old
family
to
come
east
and
investigate
them
and
even
if
they
had
knowing
nothing
of
the
eastern
or
indeed
of
any
lumber
market
they
had
no
notion
of
the
potential
value
of
their
inheritance
neale
resolved
to
take
part
of
his
little
savings
for
the
use
of
the
new
household
to
buy
up
a
few
such
and
turn
them
over
at
a
big
profit
he
felt
sure
of
himself
now
sure
he
could
swing
such
an
operation
and
taking
advantage
of
the
labor
day
vacation
he
went
up
to
west
adams
to
spend
the
and
talk
it
over
with
grandfather
nothing
ever
changed
in
grandfather
home
grandfather
and
grandmother
did
not
look
so
very
much
older
to
neale
at
than
they
had
to
the
having
always
looked
as
old
as
possible
jennie
the
hired
girl
had
aged
more
than
the
old
folks
he
noted
as
she
went
with
him
up
the
steep
stairs
to
the
little
room
now
incredibly
low
and
tiny
he
sat
down
on
his
bed
a
thousand
forgotten
memories
standing
thick
about
him
he
saw
his
mother
leading
in
the
sleepy
little
neale
and
now
he
saw
that
she
was
young
young
as
martha
so
young
herself
as
young
as
martha
he
was
the
strong
purposeful
determined
young
man
sitting
on
the
bed
and
looking
at
that
scene
and
yet
he
was
also
the
sleepy
little
boy
feeling
on
his
lips
his
young
mother
kiss
neale
mother
oh
damn
it
he
cried
impatiently
dismayed
to
feel
that
with
the
memory
of
his
mother
he
was
aware
as
though
of
a
palpable
presence
in
the
room
there
of
women
of
women
as
different
from
men
emotionally
exacting
wanting
something
different
from
men
with
some
impossible
ideal
of
what
could
be
had
out
of
human
nature
troubling
hampering
the
real
business
of
life
and
yet
all
the
time
an
inevitable
part
of
things
for
an
instant
he
felt
brutally
angry
with
them
with
their
superfine
weakening
notions
and
had
for
the
first
time
the
exasperated
feeling
that
they
were
an
element
in
life
which
you
could
neither
do
anything
with
nor
do
without
the
good
heavens
all
it
did
was
to
snarl
things
up
neale
got
up
from
the
bed
and
went
over
to
the
amazed
at
himself
his
fit
of
fury
passed
unable
to
conceive
what
had
started
him
off
on
such
an
explosion
what
under
the
sun
possessed
him
veering
around
like
a
crazy
from
one
mood
to
another
more
shifts
of
feeling
in
a
day
than
he
had
ever
used
to
know
in
a
year
he
would
put
it
all
out
of
his
mind
all
he
simply
would
not
allow
himself
to
think
of
it
again
to
think
of
all
that
he
would
not
he
went
hastily
down
the
stairs
and
fell
to
talking
business
with
grandfather
talking
to
very
good
purpose
too
their
projects
went
far
beyond
the
little
tract
of
oak
they
had
first
thought
of
grandfather
wily
old
spider
at
the
center
of
a
web
knew
many
tips
which
he
was
more
than
willing
to
pass
on
to
his
favorite
neale
neale
who
had
the
other
half
of
the
combination
and
could
sell
at
top
prices
what
grandfather
could
buy
at
he
was
in
fact
delighted
with
neale
ideas
and
the
energy
with
which
neale
laid
his
plans
why
you
worth
two
of
your
father
he
cried
exultantly
as
they
sat
again
the
next
morning
on
the
porch
and
went
into
details
i
never
could
see
why
did
get
on
better
he
never
seemed
to
care
enough
about
it
and
by
thunder
you
got
to
care
if
you
going
to
get
anywhere
the
old
man
paused
took
breath
and
brought
out
with
an
attempt
to
sound
casual
i
thought
sometimes
your
mother
made
him
that
way
she
a
nice
girl
your
mother
is
neale
but
i
never
thought
she
your
father
the
way
she
ought
to
he
glanced
at
neale
a
little
apprehensively
but
the
young
man
said
nothing
he
was
following
out
a
thought
not
entirely
new
a
guess
which
he
had
subconsciously
made
before
that
there
was
a
long
hostility
between
his
mother
and
his
grandfather
the
idea
stirred
a
great
deal
in
his
own
head
which
he
felt
no
desire
to
examine
i
tell
you
what
neale
said
the
old
man
observing
the
silence
and
emboldened
by
it
i
tell
you
what
neale
the
old
man
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
and
spoke
more
loudly
do
you
get
to
thinking
women
are
too
darned
that
what
your
father
did
he
was
going
good
but
that
softened
him
right
up
neale
still
said
nothing
a
succession
of
scenes
from
his
early
evoked
by
his
grandfather
words
the
old
man
cried
out
now
in
a
burst
of
resentment
your
father
ought
to
have
gone
enough
sight
further
than
he
did
yes
he
had
ought
to
he
looked
keenly
into
the
hard
strong
face
of
his
grandson
and
said
proudly
but
will
neale
felt
so
queer
a
disquiet
at
all
this
that
he
got
up
abruptly
and
clapped
on
his
hat
all
kinds
of
different
pieces
were
fitting
together
before
his
eyes
into
some
sort
of
a
pattern
he
wanted
to
get
away
by
himself
and
look
at
it
to
see
what
pattern
it
was
i
going
up
to
the
far
he
said
i
can
remember
when
the
pines
were
just
coming
in
there
i
want
to
see
how
much
they
grow
in
fifteen
or
twenty
years
but
he
had
no
interest
in
the
young
pines
and
he
was
not
at
all
thinking
of
them
as
he
strode
hurriedly
up
the
stony
sunken
he
was
thinking
of
martha
out
of
nowhere
there
had
come
to
him
the
recollection
of
saying
to
her
at
the
station
he
had
kissed
her
and
as
clearly
as
though
he
had
just
now
stooped
to
her
he
could
remember
that
the
very
instant
their
lips
met
he
had
been
wondering
if
he
would
have
time
to
get
down
to
the
office
before
gilman
came
in
from
chicago
he
wanted
gilman
support
for
his
scheme
to
follow
the
shifting
center
of
supply
with
a
branch
office
in
the
gulf
states
were
the
figures
he
wanted
filed
under
l
for
louisiana
or
y
for
yellow
pine
he
laughed
rather
grimly
to
himself
marching
rapidly
up
through
the
birch
on
which
with
one
corner
of
his
eye
he
was
automatically
setting
a
possible
value
if
grandfather
only
knew
he
would
think
he
needed
any
exhortation
to
avoid
uxoriousness
he
was
not
very
proud
of
that
remembered
moment
at
the
station
it
was
all
very
well
not
to
be
uxorious
but
when
a
clear
tiny
brook
crossed
the
road
he
stopped
to
draw
breath
for
without
knowing
it
he
had
been
hurrying
as
if
not
to
miss
an
appointment
up
on
the
mountain
he
saw
his
father
stooping
to
say
to
his
mother
at
the
train
as
the
yearly
summer
vacation
began
he
had
seen
that
every
june
of
his
little
boyhood
but
he
had
never
looked
at
it
till
a
man
grown
he
now
stood
on
the
mountain
and
stared
back
through
the
years
into
his
father
face
what
he
saw
there
was
startling
and
troubling
to
him
he
stood
frowning
sternly
down
at
the
brook
he
was
very
very
unhappy
and
he
resented
his
unhappiness
but
his
unhappiness
was
nothing
to
the
remorse
which
now
shook
him
if
that
was
what
marriage
could
mean
to
a
man
and
a
woman
what
right
had
he
to
ask
martha
to
accept
what
he
had
to
give
martha
was
so
fine
so
true
dear
dear
martha
to
his
amazement
almost
to
his
fright
he
saw
the
brook
waver
and
flicker
and
knew
that
the
tears
were
in
his
eyes
for
god
sake
what
was
the
matter
with
him
he
sat
down
on
a
fallen
log
looking
back
down
towards
the
valley
and
found
that
far
beneath
him
lay
the
sunburned
flat
upper
pasture
where
in
his
junior
year
he
had
practised
so
fiercely
to
learn
how
to
punt
he
cast
a
glance
of
envy
back
at
the
sweating
anxious
boy
who
could
conceive
of
nothing
worse
in
life
than
to
have
a
kick
blocked
how
lucky
kids
were
only
they
did
know
it
never
for
a
moment
to
dream
of
such
a
heavy
burden
of
obscure
misery
as
that
which
now
sickened
his
heart
what
was
the
trouble
what
the
trouble
he
had
everything
in
the
world
a
man
could
work
for
why
then
did
he
stand
there
as
wretched
as
a
man
who
can
not
pay
his
debts
the
feeling
of
oppression
of
weight
was
intolerable
like
a
physical
constriction
he
stretched
his
great
arms
and
shook
himself
and
drew
a
long
breath
trying
to
throw
it
off
physically
in
the
back
of
his
mind
stood
his
father
looking
down
at
his
mother
but
now
he
would
not
look
him
in
the
face
for
if
he
did
he
would
see
that
he
was
not
in
love
with
martha
deep
and
tender
as
was
his
affection
for
her
with
this
sudden
involuntary
formulation
of
what
he
had
been
fighting
not
to
formulate
the
trouble
and
restlessness
and
disquiet
dropped
away
and
left
neale
sitting
his
face
gray
and
grim
looking
steadily
at
what
he
ought
to
have
seen
long
ago
at
what
he
had
known
for
a
long
time
that
was
what
the
trouble
was
he
a
man
who
could
not
pay
his
debt
and
he
owed
it
to
the
person
he
loved
best
well
it
was
better
infinitely
better
now
that
he
knew
what
there
was
to
face
he
could
face
anything
anything
if
he
could
see
it
his
native
energy
rose
up
that
energy
which
had
been
so
carefully
and
steadily
trained
to
aggressive
strength
he
would
take
anything
lying
down
he
would
stand
up
to
this
the
young
man
with
the
hard
strong
face
sat
as
silent
and
motionless
as
though
he
did
not
breathe
the
bright
sun
wheeled
slowly
across
the
sky
the
shadows
stretched
longer
when
he
finally
rose
to
his
feet
stiff
and
lame
with
his
long
immobility
he
had
constructed
a
new
little
world
in
which
to
live
different
from
what
he
had
foreseen
but
tolerable
probably
all
that
could
be
expected
by
any
one
who
had
an
honest
mind
at
least
it
was
constructed
on
things
exactly
as
they
were
these
were
the
foundations
and
boundaries
of
his
new
world
a
profound
doubt
as
to
whether
any
one
outside
of
books
is
ever
in
love
as
men
and
women
are
traditionally
supposed
to
be
a
certainty
that
with
his
deep
affection
for
martha
his
respect
for
her
his
liking
for
all
her
ways
he
could
make
her
happy
happy
enough
and
be
happy
with
her
as
happy
as
any
one
in
this
world
was
likely
to
be
the
probability
that
a
normal
healthy
man
married
to
a
young
and
comely
woman
would
fall
in
love
with
her
sufficiently
at
least
to
satisfy
any
conception
she
would
be
likely
to
have
of
love
sufficiently
to
satisfy
what
any
honest
man
had
a
right
to
expect
from
love
a
guess
that
in
the
long
run
such
a
marriage
would
be
more
to
his
taste
possibly
also
to
martha
than
a
more
absorbing
exciting
union
it
would
certainly
be
all
right
for
martha
if
they
had
children
the
point
was
that
he
could
do
infinitely
more
for
her
advance
and
succeed
and
triumph
unclogged
by
too
much
personal
life
he
did
not
he
decided
looking
back
over
his
life
seem
to
be
the
sort
of
man
who
really
cared
much
for
personal
life
he
never
had
his
few
tentative
steps
towards
it
had
always
made
him
miserable
a
fish
out
of
water
what
he
really
did
care
for
what
he
had
always
liked
when
he
got
it
was
a
chance
to
use
his
strength
and
wits
in
competition
with
other
men
was
that
after
all
the
real
business
of
life
was
that
after
all
what
women
wanted
of
men
that
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
marriages
he
saw
about
him
in
the
homes
of
the
older
men
where
he
occasionally
was
asked
to
dinner
he
could
give
martha
all
they
gave
to
their
apparently
wives
and
more
much
more
because
martha
was
such
a
dear
dear
girl
and
that
was
enough
enough
for
any
one
he
did
not
feel
very
it
is
true
but
life
evidently
was
not
a
very
business
and
he
was
no
grimacing
professional
optimist
you
took
what
was
coming
to
you
and
what
was
coming
to
him
was
plenty
good
enough
for
anybody
the
thought
of
father
and
mother
knocked
at
the
door
but
he
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
and
started
down
the
mountain
to
his
grandfather
the
most
promising
young
business
man
who
had
ever
entered

employ
of

chapter
xxxiv
martha
came
into
the
room
with
a
little
rush
as
though
she
had
been
waiting
impatiently
to
see
neale
and
yet
when
she
saw
him
she
gave
a
little
quavering
oh
as
of
fright
and
stood
near
the
door
neale
conscious
of
nothing
but
his
own
heavy
heart
was
so
startled
that
he
had
for
an
instant
the
fantastic
notion
that
his
mountain
colloquy
with
himself
was
perhaps
written
on
his
face
and
that
martha
had
read
it
at
a
glance
but
before
he
could
move
she
had
moved
herself
and
come
towards
him
as
swiftly
as
she
had
first
entered
the
room
she
spoke
swiftly
too
as
though
she
were
afraid
of
losing
her
breath
before
she
could
say
what
she
had
to
say
and
yet
she
had
already
lost
her
breath
and
was
panting
neale
dear
dear
neale
her
voice
was
quavering
and
very
low
i
must
tell
you
quickly
neale
i
afraid
i
done
you
a
great
wrong
neale
i
love
you
better
than
any
one
i
ever
saw
but
her
voice
sank
so
low
neale
could
scarcely
hear
her
i
do
want
to
marry
you
her
lips
began
to
tremble
she
hung
her
head
and
neale
could
see
the
dark
red
flooding
up
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
he
was
for
a
moment
literally
incapable
of
speech
she
went
on
falteringly
out
in
cleveland
at
margaret
wedding
you
know
everybody
talking
about
getting
married
and
margaret
she
like
my
sister
we
so
near
each
other
and
we
talked
she
was
just
going
to
be
married
and
she
thought
i
was
too
and
i
thought
so
truly
neale
i
never
dreamed
of
anything
else
and
she
talked
to
me
as
one
woman
about
to
be
married
talks
to
another
not
girls
talk
she
began
to
cry
a
little
now
though
she
made
a
great
effort
to
control
herself
drawing
long
long
breaths
and
halting
between
her
words
trying
to
bring
them
out
quietly
neale
i
afraid
you
understand
i
do
know
how
to
tell
you
i
do
know
how
to
tell
you
you
see
i
never
knew
my
mother
and
i
never
liked
to
talk
intimately
with
other
girls
about
about
but
margaret
is
so
fine
and
she
cried
out
what
she
had
to
say
in
one
burst
in
a
loud
voice
of
pain
oh
neale
when
i
saw
margaret
with
her
lover
i
knew
i
knew
i
never
loved
you
at
all
i
knew
i
hate
you
if
we
were
married
she
turned
away
and
leaned
against
the
wall
sobbing
her
face
hidden
in
the
crook
of
her
arm
what
the
matter
with
me
she
cried
desperately
brokenly
why
do
i
am
i
different
from
other
women
i
ca
bear
to
hurt
you
so
i
want
to
love
you
what
can
i
do
with
myself
if
i
do
the
two
stood
there
the
broken
pieces
of
their
life
lying
in
a
heap
between
them
over
the
heap
neale
took
one
long
step
and
put
his
arms
around
martha
so
tenderly
so
quietly
that
she
did
not
start
or
shrink
away
she
stopped
sobbing
she
stood
still
in
his
arms
breathlessly
still
as
though
she
were
listening
intently
as
though
she
were
taking
in
some
knowledge
from
a
source
not
articulate
she
turned
her
face
to
his
and
said
abruptly
neale
it
just
come
to
me
i
had
thought
of
that
perhaps
you
do
really
love
me
either
not
in
way
perhaps
you
never
did
perhaps
i
just
found
all
of
it
out
in
time
neale
was
startled
frightened
unutterably
desolate
but
he
made
no
pretense
of
being
taken
by
surprise
i
ca
bear
to
give
you
up
martha
he
said
looking
down
at
her
perhaps
what
we
have
is
all
we
could
ever
have
we
may
lose
this
and
have
nothing
perhaps
there
really
is
nothing
else
what
we
have
is
is
very
good
to
have
his
face
contracted
in
a
pain
that
really
did
surprise
him
by
its
keenness
he
was
horrified
at
the
idea
of
losing
martha
altogether
martha
gazed
steadily
into
his
face
as
if
trying
to
understand
what
he
said
their
old
habit
of
sharing
things
of
talking
things
over
strong
on
her
he
noted
how
pale
and
drawn
her
face
was
with
dark
rings
under
her
eyes
she
had
been
suffering
she
too
had
had
broken
nights
and
as
he
looked
he
saw
from
her
eyes
that
she
was
no
longer
seeing
him
but
some
inner
vision
she
shivered
and
drew
away
from
him
yes
there
is
something
else
something
we
have
and
it
what
makes
it
all
right
she
said
i
rather
have
nothing
at
all
nothing
than
something
that
would
make
part
of
me
shrink
away
from
you
i
could
stand
that
i
could
stand
that
she
had
said
the
last
words
wildly
and
she
was
back
by
the
door
now
as
if
ready
for
flight
neale
sat
down
heavily
in
a
chair
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
all
that
this
means
he
said
to
himself
as
much
as
to
martha
all
that
this
means
any
of
it
is
that
i
have
not
been
man
enough
to
make
you
love
me
at
this
she
came
flying
back
to
him
incarnate
tenderness
no
no
neale
i
love
you
i
know
in
my
heart
that
even
if
i
should
ever
marry
any
one
else
i
never
feel
for
anybody
the
affection
the
trust
i
could
it
not
that
loving
you
as
i
do
only
makes
it
more
impossible
more
utterly
impossible
you
must
think
this
is
just
the
nervous
reaction
from
any
sudden
shock
of
knowledge
i
knew
i
knew
well
enough
what
marriage
is
but
i
had
felt
it
she
moaned
aloud
in
her
bewilderment
how
can
i
tell
you
how
can
i
make
you
understand
i
do
understand
myself
why
ca
i
give
you
what
margaret
has
to
give
she
was
bending
over
him
and
now
snatched
his
hand
and
caught
it
up
to
her
breast
neale
i
give
anything
to
want
to
marry
you
anything
i
tried
and
tried
it
like
a
mountain
between
us
i
ca
reach
you
through
it
neale
perhaps
we
too
much
alike
perhaps
that
is
what
brought
us
together
but
that
is
what
keeps
us
apart
we
unite
i
thought
of
so
many
things
we
like
two
chemicals
that
combine
they
ca
that
the
way
they
made
neale
found
himself
resisting
her
certainty
although
it
had
been
his
own
he
sat
up
suddenly
astounded
at
all
that
was
being
said
and
cried
roughly
martha
do
you
know
what
this
means
you
are
sending
me
away
what
can
i
do
without
you
he
caught
at
her
hand
martha
why
hunt
for
rainbows
when
we
have
the
pot
of
gold
in
our
hands
she
shook
her
head
it
would
be
the
pot
of
gold
she
said
sadly
it
would
be
a
mess
of
pottage
and
you
must
sell
your
heritage
for
it
any
more
than
i
he
looked
at
her
hard
and
saw
that
he
had
no
hold
on
her
oh
it
finished
for
me
he
cried
bitterly
out
of
all
patience
if
you
send
me
away
for
some
romantic
notion
you
need
have
no
idea
that
i
will
marry
any
one
else
i
shall
never
have
anything
to
do
with
a
woman
again
she
said
steadfastly
though
her
lips
were
trembling
i
think
when
a
question
of
what
the
finest
in
us
that
nothing
at
all
is
better
than
a
halting
compromise
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
he
said
angrily
and
for
the
moment
truthfully
you
ruining
our
two
lives
for
some
fancy
she
grew
paler
and
said
in
a
deep
voice
neale
i
have
told
you
that
i
would
hate
you
if
you
were
my
husband
he
turned
away
to
the
door
he
said
coldly
she
did
not
answer
he
went
out
of
the
door
and
down
the
stairs
at
the
bottom
he
turned
and
came
up
again
he
found
her
standing
where
he
had
left
her
he
said
gently
you
right
martha
she
held
out
her
arms
to
him
they
kissed
sadly
wistfully
like
brother
and
sister
parting
for
a
long
separation
neale
went
away
silently
in
a
confusion
so
great
that
from
time
to
time
he
stopped
on
the
sidewalk
till
the
street
straightened
itself
out
before
him
and
he
could
see
where
to
take
the
next
step
chapter

neale
had
set
the
wheels
of
his
business
life
whirring
at
such
speed
and
there
were
so
many
of
them
that
they
continued
to
turn
clatteringly
around
and
around
after
martha
had
gone
away
not
only
from
him
but
from
america
for
she
had
sailed
at
once
with
her
father
for
berlin
neale
watched
them
whirring
for
weeks
before
he
perceived
that
they
were
running
down
and
for
weeks
after
that
before
he
perceived
that
he
felt
no
impulse
to
keep
them
moving
there
did
seem
to
be
much
point
to
things
any
more
martha
had
done
what
in
his
heart
he
wanted
done
and
yet
he
was
far
from
satisfied
he
missed
her
outrageously
missed
having
her
there
did
know
what
to
do
with
himself
and
yet
he
had
not
been
overjoyed
at
what
he
had
been
on
the
point
of
doing
with
himself
he
must
be
hard
to
suit
he
thought
fretting
to
feel
himself
still
confused
and
uncertain
with
no
zest
in
things
damn
it
what
he
want
a
week
after
martha
departure
he
had
a
letter
from
grandfather
written
on
paper
reading
dear
neale
wharton
just
came
in
to
say
he
wants
the
melwin
spruce
and
heard
you
had
bought
them
he
wanted
for
twelve
hundred
could
find
out
what
you
paid
for
them
i
guess
i
said
fifteen
hundred
and
stuck
to
it
he
squirmed
some
but
i
knew
through
ed
that
he
wanted
them
for
a
new
york
order
he
got
for
big
stuff
and
there
are
any
others
around
here
that
come
up
to
his
specifications
so
i
made
him
toe
the
mark
he
left
a
check
for
which
i
enclose
and
will
pay
spot
cash
for
the
rest
before
beginning
to
cut
neale
sat
at
his
desk
looking
hard
at
the
piece
of
cheap
paper
which
brought
him
the
news
that
in
a
short
time
he
would
have
eight
hundred
dollars
more
in
the
bank
than
he
had
had
before
and
without
turning
his
hand
over
all
he
had
done
was
to
know
that
the
melwin
spruce
were
worth
a
lot
more
than
was
thought
by
the
iowa
cousin
who
had
inherited
that
distant
easy
money
somebody
had
paid
him
high
for
that
piece
of
knowledge
who
wharton
of
course
would
certainly
get
it
out
of
somebody
else
hide
or
he
would
never
have
gone
in
for
the
deal
he
sat
dreaming
remembering
his
trip
remembering
the
choppers
and
woodmen
he
had
known
around
grandfather
men
like
that
would
work
all
a
year
around
in
all
weathers
all
their
days
to
get
as
much
as
he
would
have
for
doing
nothing
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
turned
to
enter
the
check
in
his
a
queer
sort
of
a
world
and
after
all
he
stood
in
much
the
same
relation
to
the
gates
family
as
the
lumbermen
did
to
him
working
enough
sight
harder
for
enough
sight
less
money
that
seemed
to
be
the
way
things
were
but
it
did
seem
quite
square
a
hasty
mental
calculation
showed
him
that
with
this
money
he
would
have
over
two
thousand
dollars
clear
not
so
bad
he
considered
the
matter
wondering
why
he
felt
no
more
elation
and
decided
that
it
was
because
he
could
not
for
a
moment
think
of
anything
he
specially
wanted
to
do
with
two
thousand
dollars
always
before
this
he
had
thought
he
was
making
money
to
give
to
martha
was
it
possible
that
he
had
been
using
martha
as
an
excuse
no
no
he
explained
hastily
to
himself
the
point
was
that
martha
had
all
women
had
some
definite
use
to
make
of
money
it
bought
things
they
wanted
and
thought
important
suburban
houses
and
mahogany
twin
beds
and
what
not
martha
could
easily
have
spent
that
sum
to
buy
things
that
pleased
her
the
only
use
he
could
think
of
for
it
was
to
use
it
over
again
to
make
more
money
and
then
what
it
seem
much
of
a
life
to
do
that
over
and
over
he
looked
around
him
at
the
busy
outer
office
filled
with
haste
and
a
sense
of
the
importance
of
its
processes
there
was
more
to
it
than
making
money
that
was
the
foolish
idea
of
sordid
business
you
were
in
it
not
because
you
wanted
the
money
but
because
it
was
the
biggest
game
in
the
world
and
it
was
fun
to
win
out
all
right
then
he
win
out
but
no
matter
how
much
time
he
put
into
his
efforts
to
win
out
there
was
a
lot
of
time
left
over
neale
did
not
succeed
in
filling
that
leisure
to
his
satisfaction
he
went
out
more
than
he
had
ever
before
accepted
invitations
to
dinner
from
all
the
married
men
in
the
office
and
lunched
with
all
the
unmarried
and
had
them
out
for
meals
with
him
but
still
there
was
time
left
over
he
went
to
the
theater
to
loud
hearty
farces
that
made
him
laugh
at
first
but
they
very
soon
seemed
all
cut
by
the
same
pattern
and
he
found
himself
sitting
them
out
as
grimly
and
smilelessly
as
americans
read
their
comic
supplements
it
was
not
that
he
was
lonely
because
he
was
alone
never
in
his
life
had
he
found
the
slightest
alleviation
to
loneliness
in
merely
having
some
one
any
one
with
him
the
truth
was
that
when
he
was
alone
he
fell
to
thinking
and
he
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
his
thoughts
they
mostly
consisted
of
an
answerless
question
so
answerless
in
the
nature
of
things
that
it
was
foolish
to
formulate
it
the
same
old
question
you
always
ran
into
when
you
stopped
to
think
what
are
you
doing
all
this
anyhow
in
football
days
that
question
had
been
silenced
by
the
instant
fierce
answer
for
the
team
what
was
the
present
equivalent
of
the
team
now
it
looked
remarkably
like
neale
crittenden
all
by
himself
not
such
a
very
big
inspiring
goal
when
you
stopped
to
think
of
it
the
best
thing
evidently
was
not
to
do
much
stopping
to
think
one
evening
unwarily
he
allowed
something
alarming
to
happen
to
him
something
worse
than
stopping
to
think
after
a
solitary
dinner
at
reisenweber
he
strolled
along
street
and
as
it
seemed
too
early
to
go
back
to
his
room
and
he
had
nothing
else
to
do
that
evening
stepped
into
a
concert
at
carnegie
hall
he
stepped
in
to
get
rid
of
a
few
hours
of
his
restless
uneasiness
and
he
came
out
so
devoured
by
restless
uneasiness
that
he
could
not
think
of
going
to
bed
but
walked
up
and
down
the
streets
for
hours
trying
to
forget
the
shouts
of
the
brass
the
long
sweet
cries
of
the
violins
they
seemed
to
call
his
name
over
and
over
to
summon
him
out
up
to
some
glory
little
by
little
they
died
away
leaving
him
in
the
same
flat
inner
silence
as
before
hearing
nothing
but
the
banging
clatter
of
the
elevated
and
the
clang
of
the
bells
a
little
before
dawn
he
went
back
to
bed
exhausted
what
sort
of
a
life
was
this
anyhow
he
was
less
away
from
the
city
than
usual
now
spent
more
time
at
his
desk
which
was
usually
in
those
days
heaped
with
work
that
had
formerly
been
done
by
other
men
the
office
was
shifting
its
routine
rearranging
the
work
to
meet
the
strain
of
the
manager
failing
health
it
was
whispered
that
gates
the
young
gates
though
only
might
have
to
pull
out
altogether
that
would
mean
promotion
all
around
neale
knew
by
the
character
of
the
work
on
his
desk
that
when
promotion
was
served
out
he
would
get
his
share
flittingly
once
or
twice
it
occurred
to
him
that
all
the
managers
of
departments
were
but
mortal
and
that
in
time
all
their
private
offices
would
be
filled
by
the
men
now
working
at
desks
in
the
outer
rooms
how
would
he
like
in
the
end
to
move
into
gates
office
he
wondered
this
thought
casual
and
fantastic
though
it
was
moved
him
to
inquire
whatever
was
the
matter
with
gates
health
anyhow
he
was
told
that
the
older
man
was
threatened
with
a
complete
nervous
breakdown
due
to
overwork
neale
like
all
other
american
had
heard
that
phrase
all
his
life
the
very
wording
of
it
was
as
familiar
to
him
as
the
name
of
a
standard
make
of
soap
or
collar
but
he
found
he
did
not
after
all
really
know
what
it
meant
what
happened
to
anybody
who
had
a
complete
nervous
breakdown
gates
came
and
went
about
as
usual
although
not
so
regularly
looking
about
the
same
spare
dry
hard
well
dressed
well
shaved
attentive
silent
neale
looked
at
him
with
some
curiosity
wondering
how
a
threatened
nervous
breakdown
showed
itself
and
deciding
skeptically
that
there
was
probably
the
same
amount
of
nervousness
about
it
as
about
everything
less
in
it
than
people
made
out
money
for
specialists
mostly
one
day
he
was
consulting
a
near
the
door
to
the
office
which
stood
ajar
over
the
file
neale
could
see
the
familiar
scene
gates
private
secretary
standing
to
the
right
of
his
employer
in
a
respectful
attitude
a
bunch
of
letters
in
his
hand
gates
adjusted
his
their
fine
gold
chain
gleaming
yellow
against
the
hard
gray
of
his
thin
cheeks
he
took
a
letter
off
the
pile
and
held
it
up
before
him
to
neale
astonishment
the
paper
shook
as
though
a
high
wind
were
blowing
through
the
room
a
look
of
anxious
effort
came
into
the
older
man
face
he
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
tried
to
take
the
letter
in
both
hands
but
it
fell
out
of
his
trembling
fingers
upon
the
desk
and
slid
to
the
floor
gates
stooped
secured
it
with
difficulty
and
lifted
his
head
to
recover
his
position
as
he
did
this
with
rather
a
jerk
to
get
his
balance
the
drooping
loop
of
his
chain
caught
on
the
key
of
the
drawer
and
tore
his
glasses
off
they
fell
on
the
desk
with
a
little
tinkling
clatter
broken
and
instantly
gates
flung
the
letter
from
him
put
both
hands
over
his
face
and
burst
into
tears
neale
heard
the
sound
of
his
sobbing
his
secretary
looking
concerned
but
not
surprised
sprang
to
the
heavy
door
and
slammed
it
shut
neale
stood
frozen
with
one
hand
on
a
letter
in
the
file
frightened
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
so
frightened
that
it
made
him
sick
when
he
recovered
presence
of
mind
enough
to
move
he
away
to
his
own
desk
and
sat
down
before
it
shaken
so
that
was
a
nervous
breakdown
good
god
he
was
so
sure
he
wanted
to
move
up
ultimately
into
that
office
for
a
long
time
after
this
he
was
haunted
by
the
recollection
of
that
scene
and
especially
by
the
sound
of
those
strange
shocking
sobs
sometimes
they
woke
him
up
at
night
as
though
it
were
a
sound
in
the
room
they
recurred
to
him
at
the
most
inopportune
moments
in
a
train
at
table
as
he
undressed
for
the
night
in
a
bedroom
of
a
country
hotel
he
would
have
given
anything
not
to
have
heard
them
he
tried
everything
to
drown
them
out
he
turned
again
at
this
time
to
books
and
took
down
from
the
shelves
volumes
he
had
not
looked
at
since
college
books
of
speculation
abstract
thought
history
he
found
gregg
marks
in
one
or
two
and
wondered
how
gregg
was
liking
it
being
a
professor
out
in
california
that
was
far
away
and
so
was
gregg
and
so
were
the
books
they
looked
different
in
his
hand
remembered
pages
had
not
the
same
message
he
could
not
seem
to
put
his
mind
on
them
as
he
had
it
wandered
to
other
things
a
long
time
since
he
had
tried
to
use
his
mind
in
that
way
he
had
had
mighty
little
time
for
reading
abstract
stuff
once
starting
off
on
a
trip
sure
to
be
tiresome
with
a
long
wait
in
the
late
evening
at
hoosick
junction
he
chanced
to
put
into
his
valise
a
volume
of
emerson
he
read
the
newspaper
on
the
train
up
the
news
the
financial
page
and
what
was
going
on
in
the
world
of
sports
but
he
left
the
paper
in
the
train
and
as
he
settled
himself
for
the
dreary
wait
in
the
dreary
dusty
empty
station
he
opened
the
emerson
what
were
some
of
those
places
he
used
to
think
so
fine
society
is
a
company
in
which
the
members
agree
for
the
better
securing
of
the
bread
to
each
shareholder
to
surrender
the
liberty
and
culture
of
the
eater
the
virtue
in
most
request
is
conformity
is
its
aversion
it
loves
not
realities
and
creators
but
names
and
customs
whoso
would
be
a
man
must
be
a
nonconformist
the
other
terror
that
scares
us
from
is
our
consistency
a
reverence
for
our
past
act
or
word
but
why
should
you
keep
your
head
over
your
shoulder
why
drag
about
this
corpse
of
your
memory
lest
you
contradict
somewhat
you
have
stated
in
this
or
that
public
place
suppose
you
should
contradict
yourself
what
then
it
seems
to
be
a
rule
of
wisdom
to
bring
the
past
for
judgment
into
the
present
and
live
ever
in
a
new
day
leave
your
theory
as
joseph
his
coat
in
the
hand
of
the
harlot
and
flee
he
slammed
the
book
shut
again
it
made
him
feel
as
that
confounded
music
had
stirred
up
restless
unhappy
ashamed
it
was
a
voice
from
another
sort
of
world
a
voice
that
he
would
rather
not
hear
because
there
was
nothing
to
be
made
of
what
it
said
what
could
you
about
it
neale
detested
stirring
up
ideas
about
which
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
and
he
knew
a
great
deal
more
now
than
he
once
had
about
the
many
many
things
that
could
not
be
done
but
shutting
the
book
even
slamming
it
shut
did
not
silence
the
voice
he
sat
alone
under
the
one
smoky
kerosene
lamp
staring
into
the
dusty
dreary
empty
and
heard
it
clear
and
calm
and
summoning
leave
your
theory
as
joseph
his
coat
in
the
hand
of
the
harlot
and
flee
he
looked
about
him
desperately
but
there
was
not
a
soul
in
the
station
save
himself
nor
a
house
near
the
tracks
there
was
not
a
sound
to
drown
out
the
deep
humanity
of
that
summoning
challenging
voice
he
made
an
impatient
rebellious
gesture
summoning
that
was
all
very
well
but
to
what
to
something
better
than
he
had
more
worth
while
than
he
was
well
what
was
there
where
could
it
be
found
those
vague
phrases
were
easy
enough
to
write
but
what
could
you
about
it
in
real
life
what
was
the
matter
with
what
he
had
the
matter
with
it
was
that
it
was
bare
and
dingy
and
empty
like
the
room
in
which
he
sat
but
what
was
not
everything
was
like
that
if
you
did
believe
the
nonsense
written
about
it
if
you
looked
at
it
and
saw
it
it
was
to
be
supposed
that
he
neale
crittenden
would
go
and
be
a
missionary
was
it
or
any
of
those
pious
priggish
devices
to
pretend
that
you
were
doing
something
worth
while
or
join
the
salvation
army
and
beat
a
drum
he
was
an
american
what
in
hell
did
emerson
think
you
do
he
got
up
and
walked
restlessly
around
the
dreadful
little
room
helpless
before
its
bareness
nothing
to
read
in
the
place
not
even
a
nothing
but
the
emerson
he
went
over
to
where
it
lay
on
the
bench
opened
his
valise
put
the
book
back
in
down
among
his
shirts
and
snapped
the
valise
shut
on
it
a
whistle
sounded
down
the
track
he
looked
at
his
watch
no
his
train
was
not
due
for
half
an
hour
yet
he
went
to
the
door
and
watched
a
through
freight
roll
past
noting
the
names
on
the
cars
as
they
flashed
into
the
light
from
the
window
y
central

wabash

all
necessary
honest
goods
all
necessary
honest
work
but
that
could
be
of
life
the
train
pounded
off
the
silence
of
the
night
closed
in
on
him
and
in
that
silence
he
heard
the
echo
of
those
appalling
sobs
and
the
slam
of
the
door
queer
thing
human
life
was
was
it
think
of
poor
gates
paying
that
price
and
very
likely
for
something
he
did
care
so
much
about
when
he
got
it
it
was
the
price
you
paid
that
bothered
neale
if
it
were
something
worth
your
while
you
were
willing
to
pay
all
you
had
but
to
pay
so
much
just
to
make
money
for
neale
crittenden
he
could
see
it
that
way
he
have
a
smoke
on
it
anyhow
as
he
filled
his
pipe
it
came
to
him
that
once
before
he
had
felt
the
same
aching
restlessness
so
intense
that
it
was
pain
that
was
the
time
when
he
had
gone
stale
he
been
put
out
of
the
game
and
had
sat
on
the
eating
his
heart
out
he
was
there
again
gone
stale
out
of
the
game
he
had
the
strength
he
had
the
speed
now
as
then
why
was
it
he
stood
outside
the
game
other
men
were
giving
their
souls
to
it
maybe
he
a
quitter
after
all
there
had
certainly
been
quitting
or
the
matter
in
his
relations
with
martha
how
empty
life
was
without
martha
but
he
was
mighty
glad
he
was
going
to
marry
her
he
was
a
fine
specimen
anyhow
well
now
well
now
he
shook
himself
together
let
consider
all
this
what
the
best
thing
to
do
when
you
go
stale
and
have
a
slump
atkins
had
showed
him
what
to
do
that
other
time
he
had
actually
profited
by
it
in
the
end
profited
immensely
by
being
temporarily
out
of
the
game
so
that
he
could
consider
and
understand
the
real
inwardness
of
what
it
was
all
about
why
perhaps
that
was
what
he
needed
to
do
now
pull
out
for
a
while
get
away
from
the
whole
thing
look
at
it
from
a
distance
get
a
line
on
what
it
was
all
about
he
sucked
on
his
pipe
cocking
his
head
sidewise
to
look
at
the
ceiling
his
hands
deep
in
his
pockets
there
was
nothing
to
hinder
his
taking
a
year
off
he
had
money
enough
and
not
a
tie
on
earth
to
prevent
his
doing
as
he
pleased
he
lose
his
job
of
course
but
he
did
seem
to
be
just
madly
in
love
with
his
job
anyhow
and
there
were
other
jobs
well
by
george
why
not
where
should
he
go
anywhere
that
was
the
lumber
business
there
was
the
whole
world
the
round
globe
hurtling
through
the
infinite
what
in
god
name
was
he
doing
in
hoosick
junction
there
was
england
and
france
and
italy
and
after
that
why
anywhere
again
wherever
he
pleased
the
east
china
and
where
there
were
malays
and
jungles
when
his
money
gave
out
if
he
still
wanted
to
stay
on
he
could
earn
his
living
as
well
there
as
here
there
that
meant
anywhere
else
anywhere
else
must
be
less
dusty
and
frowsy
and
empty
than
here
why
under
the
sun
had
he
not
thought
of
this
before
their
damned
old
labels
do
stick
after
all
but
he
would
soak
them
off
his
heart
unfolded
from
its
painful
tight
compression
the
way
out
why
had
he
been
so
long
in
seeing
it
the
way
out
was
to
put
on
your
hat
and
go
in
several
chapter
xxxvi
i
ashley
vermont
may
horace
allen
cousin
was
astonished
to
the
limit
of
astonishment
by
the
news
and
cried
out
accusingly
why
i
thought
the
other
time
it
was
only
because
flora
wanted
to
go
i
thought
you
thought
it
would
put
you
on
the
shelf
altogether
i
thought
you
hated
it
horace
considered
this
sitting
heavily
on
a
bench
while
cousin
hetty
pruned
a
nearby
rigorously
although
she
did
not
break
in
on
his
silence
with
a
well
or
did
you
hear
what
i
said
she
made
him
quite
aware
that
she
was
relentlessly
waiting
for
his
answer
well
i
did
he
admitted
finally
and
i
do
yet
and
it
did
put
me
on
the
shelf
that
all
i
good
for
now
it
because
of
my
experience
in
bayonne
they
want
me
to
take
charge
of
the
paris
office
you
do
have
to
go
if
they
do
she
pointed
out
and
this
as
she
expected
brought
out
the
real
reason
those
four
years
in
france
have
spoiled
me
for
living
here
he
said
and
awaited
doggedly
her
inevitable
cry
of
amazement
she
stood
up
from
her
shorn
her
huge
shears
in
one
hand
a
large
thorned
spray
in
the
other
well
for
goodness
sake
he
was
in
no
haste
to
answer
this
either
meditating
silently
the
spring
sun
pouring
an
incongruous
flood
of
golden
young
light
on
the
sagging
heaviness
of
his
face
cousin
hetty
let
him
alone
again
and
went
on
with
the
ruthless
snip
clash
of
her
great
shears
when
he
rose
again
to
the
surface
it
was
with
a
explanation
everybody
that
worth
anything
over
there
has
learned
how
to
do
his
job
no
business
and
there
plenty
of
cheap
you
waited
on
you
made
comfortable
you
heard
people
talk
of
the
charm
of
european
life
what
they
mean
is
cheap
labor
nothing
more
charming
for
the
employer
well
commented
cousin
hetty
after
a
time
she
remarked
resolutely
gathering
up
the
villainously
prickly
shoots
she
had
been
cutting
off
i
should
think
you
be
sort
of
ashamed
of
the
part
of
it
an
american
she
was
not
one
to
hesitate
either
to
handle
thorns
herself
or
to
thrust
them
upon
others
oh
i
am
admitted
marise
father
casually
and
then
as
though
it
gave
him
a
faint
amusement
to
shock
her
i
forgot
to
mention
their
cooking
and
good
wines
she
scorned
to
take
any
notice
of
this
going
on
and
i
think
she
stayed
her
steps
for
a
moment
as
she
turned
away
to
carry
the
trash
to
the
spot
where
the
spring
with
its
exquisite
coils
of
blue
smoke
faintly
dimmed
the
exquisite
clarity
of
the
mountain
air
i
should
think
that
if
you
found
good
workmanship
such
a
fine
thing
you
might
try
to
do
something
towards
getting
more
of
it
in
your
own
country
instead
of
just
going
off
where
it
grows
already
oh
heavens
you
do
see
me
trying
to
the
world
a
better
place
to
live
in
do
you
what
sort
of
do
you
take
me
for
he
protested
with
a
yawn
cousin
hetty
stepped
off
to
the
smoldering
threw
her
armful
of
rejected
life
on
the
flames
and
came
back
her
wasted
elderly
face
looking
stern
how
about
marise
will
it
be
the
best
thing
for
her
oh
the
best
thing
her
father
disavowed
any
pretentious
claims
to
ideas
on
that
subject
horace
do
pretend
you
do
know
what
i
mean
right
in
the
middle
of
her
college
course
shucks
for
her
college
course
he
said
how
much
good
does
college
course
amount
to
her
music
is
worth
forty
times
that
to
her
besides
she
can
keep
on
going
to
school
in
paris
ca
she
what
to
hinder
the
reference
to
music
seemed
to
give
her
a
new
idea
as
to
his
plans
an
idea
which
she
challenged
with
suspicion
what
do
you
expect
going
to
do
with
her
music
anyhow
what
do
you
her
to
do
what
do
i
expect
her
to
do
with
her
music
oh
what
does
anybody
do
with
music
use
it
to
get
what
she
wants
i
expect
her
to
succeed
on
the
concert
platform
and
get
a
lot
of
applause
and
marry
one
foreign
monkey
after
another
and
hate
every
other
musically
gifted
woman
like
poison
and
get
so
dependent
on
flattery
that
she
ca
live
hours
without
a
big
swig
of
it
from
no
matter
whose
flask
and
die
of
wounded
vanity
because
a
younger
woman
is
beginning
to
be
applauded
that
what
i
expect
of
course
what
else
is
there
to
expect
at
the
end
of
this
prophecy
which
he
had
brought
out
slowly
and
coldly
with
long
pauses
between
the
sentences
he
closed
his
eyes
and
relapsed
into
silence
as
though
it
were
all
a
matter
of
no
consequence
his
cousin
made
no
comment
but
waited
patiently
for
what
he
had
not
said
he
turned
his
bulky
body
sideways
on
the
bench
his
shoulder
to
her
like
a
sulky
boy
to
indicate
that
he
had
no
intention
of
adding
anything
but
presently
her
persistent
silent
demand
for
what
was
really
in
his
mind
brought
out
marise
in
bayonne
was
pretty
near
the
only
human
being
in
the
whole
damn
town
that
did
make
me
tired
she
was
pretty
nearly
the
only
human
being
i
ever
saw
anywhere
who
had
enough
sense
to
come
in
out
of
the
rain
she
was
an
ugly
enough
to
stop
a
clock
but
she
was
all
right
she
did
want
anything
for
herself
she
was
safe
her
music
had
put
her
where
nothing
could
touch
her
cousin
hetty
was
struck
by
the
quality
of
this
statement
she
looked
at
him
softly
that
is
what
you
want
for
marise
she
said
and
continued
to
stand
before
him
looking
down
at
him
he
was
as
much
annoyed
as
though
she
had
cried
out
emotionally
oh
you
love
her
you
think
of
how
to
be
a
good
father
to
her
and
he
cut
short
her
sickly
sentimental
display
of
feeling
by
affirming
stolidly
well
i
wo
get
it
but
you
do
see
any
other
chance
for
her
he
felt
that
she
was
taking
an
unfair
advantage
of
a
chance
lapse
on
his
part
and
dismayed
and
disgusted
by
the
pious
color
of
their
talk
was
pointedly
silent
conveying
the
impression
that
he
was
trying
to
command
his
patience
till
she
should
consent
to
stop
talking
foolishly
marise
is
a
bit
old
she
pointed
out
half
to
herself
half
to
him
she
just
seventeen
and
she
not
plain
either
you
bet
your
life
she
not
that
why
i
know
what
her
music
is
going
to
do
to
well
for
goodness
sakes
why
take
her
out
of
college
to
go
on
with
it
he
evidently
felt
that
he
had
more
than
explained
this
for
he
made
no
answer
she
said
then
a
very
plain
human
anxiety
wrinkling
her
old
face
do
you
honestly
think
horace
that
you
are
the
right
person
to
bring
up
a
pretty
girl
as
good
as
anybody
else
he
said
drily
averring
the
complete
incompetence
of
all
the
world
for
that
task
but
she
is
getting
on
so
well
at
college
she
stands
so
high
and
the
youngest
in
her
class
she
is
so
bright
oh
that
has
anything
to
do
with
her
being
bright
that
comes
from
the
schooling
she
had
in
france
she
learned
to
keep
at
whatever
she
was
doing
till
she
got
it
lord
the
sloshy
work
in
an
american
college
as
easy
as
sliding
down
hill
for
her
she
may
or
she
may
not
have
a
good
mind
she
learned
to
work
that
all
that
what
you
going
back
for
because
of
good
work
stated
cousin
hetty
oh
i
not
expecting
to
do
any
of
it
myself
he
enjoyed
his
usual
satisfaction
in
making
no
pretense
to
virtue
but
i
like
being
able
to
hire
other
folks
for
a
nickel
or
two
to
work
like
that
and
i
like
being
able
to
hire
other
folks
to
make
it
their
business
to
keep
me
comfortable
and
do
forget
the
cooking
and
the
wine
and
the
beds
there
not
a
decent
bed
in
america
she
made
him
feel
by
a
lift
of
the
eyebrows
that
she
considered
this
a
rather
sophomoric
continuance
of
the
pose
of
knowing
sophistication
at
this
he
looked
nettled
and
cross
a
little
later
as
she
stopped
in
front
of
him
with
an
armful
of
shoots
on
her
way
to
the
she
asked
but
will
marise
have
a
good
time
over
there
young
folks
here
do
have
such
good
times
in
his
turn
he
showed
her
by
a
lift
of
the
eyebrows
that
he
considered
this
too
unimportant
to
answer
she
stood
looking
down
at
her
shears
cruel
and
keen
oh
well
i
do
suppose
i
let
my
roses
have
such
a
good
time
she
said
to
herself
ii
after
supper
they
went
out
on
the
bench
while
he
smoked
his
cigar
cousin
hetty
did
not
mind
tobacco
smoke
inside
the
house
but
her
elderly
hired
girl
did
they
were
both
still
under
the
impression
of
the
tepid
warmth
of
the
afternoon
sunshine
and
were
surprised
to
find
the
evening
air
so
cold
feels
as
though
there
were
still
snow
on
the
mountains
he
remarked
recognizing
the
peculiar
raw
penetrating
chill
there
is
she
told
him
drawing
her
shawl
about
her
by
his
tone
he
had
intimated
that
he
had
passed
out
of
the
prickly
irritation
of
his
afternoon
mood
by
hers
she
had
told
him
that
she
would
as
usual
meet
him
in
any
mood
he
chose
to
feel
they
sat
down
together
on
the
wooden
bench
he
began
silently
to
smoke
and
she
to
think
my
visit
over
i
must
take
the
noon
train
he
said
and
i
half
a
notion
to
ask
your
advice
about
something
she
refrained
from
any
expression
of
the
astonishment
and
skepticism
she
felt
and
said
briefly
with
a
friendly
accent
all
right
about
marise
he
said
oh
yes
of
course
what
is
it
she
asked
in
an
altered
tone
of
quickened
interest
but
for
a
time
he
said
nothing
more
he
waited
drawing
on
his
cigar
he
drew
so
hard
that
it
began
to
gleam
redly
through
the
dusk
at
this
he
took
it
from
his
lips
and
held
it
down
his
fingers
at
his
side
where
he
did
not
see
the
raging
coal
at
its
tip
he
had
never
thought
consciously
about
this
gesture
but
it
was
an
invariable
one
with
him
there
was
something
distasteful
to
him
about
the
naked
raw
hotness
of
a
he
preferred
it
later
on
when
all
you
could
see
was
the
of
the
tobacco
the
long
fine
ash
held
together
by
nothing
at
all
ready
to
be
shattered
at
a
breath
into
floating
particles
of
nothingness
about
flora
flora
death
he
added
presently
knowing
although
she
had
given
no
sign
that
she
was
listening
intently
i
never
told
you
it
was
just
pneumonia
he
was
silent
as
if
he
did
not
know
just
how
to
get
on
with
what
he
wanted
to
say
and
finally
said
irritably
there
nothing
to
it
nothing
but
i
ca
ask
you
what
i
want
to
unless
you
know
something
about
it
she
divined
that
he
would
not
have
told
her
if
they
had
not
come
out
where
it
was
dark
where
he
could
not
see
her
she
made
herself
small
cowering
under
her
shawl
and
listened
forebodingly
as
he
went
on
his
intense
distaste
for
every
word
coloring
his
rough
abrupt
statements
i
was
up
in
bordeaux
on
business
and
one
morning
did
i
see
name
in
the
headlines
of
the
nasty
little
local
paper
from
bayonne
an
accident
at
saint
sauveur
that
a
kind
of
hot
springs
where
flora
went
sometimes
for
a
young
man
had
fallen
into
the
river
or
had
jumped
in
it
was
in
flood
with
melting
snow
and
he
was
drowned
and
because
flora
happened
to
know
him
and
be
there
the
reporter
written
up
the
accident
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
he
and
flora
to
the
conclusion
they
always
jump
to
about
everybody
cousin
hetty
did
not
stir
allowed
herself
no
inward
comment
lest
she
color
the
impersonal
attention
she
was
giving
which
she
understood
well
enough
was
with
the
darkness
the
only
condition
on
which
he
could
go
on
speaking
hell
was
it
he
said
briefly
before
continuing
i
did
know
anything
about
french
inquests
but
i
could
make
a
guess
they
would
take
care
to
make
this
one
as
uncomfortable
for
flora
as
they
could
sounded
like
a
good
chance
for
blackmail
too
so
i
telegraphed
back
to
the
house
that
i
be
back
on
the
next
train
i
found
out
afterwards
that
marise
had
wired
me
but
i
never
got
her
telegram
then
before
the
train
started
i
beat
it
to
the
office
of
a
french
lawyer
in
bordeaux
and
found
out
all
i
wanted
to
about
french
inquests
i
found
out
then
that
there
was
any
real
danger
that
they
could
do
a
thing
except
talk
about
it
but
heavens
their
talk
was
apt
to
be
it
was
up
to
me
to
get
back
and
look
out
for
flora
poor
flora
you
know
she
had
no
more
harm
in
her
than
a
kitten
cousin
hetty
felt
a
long
rigorous
tremor
run
through
her
partly
the
cold
of
the
mountain
evening
partly
an
inner
chill
poor
she
said
now
in
a
trembling
voice
it
was
the
only
word
she
spoke
the
only
comment
she
made
on
what
he
had
told
her
on
what
he
was
to
tell
her
well
when
my
train
pulled
into
bayonne
the
next
morning
there
was
marise
to
meet
me
and
great
scott
she
almost
scared
the
life
out
of
me
crying
and
hanging
on
to
me
i
did
know
what
happened
besides
what
was
in
the
paper
what
she
had
heard
but
in
a
minute
she
got
over
that
enough
to
tell
me
what
thought
the
matter
was
her
mother
all
shaken
up
from
the
nervous
shock
of
seeing
somebody
killed
all
upset
gone
to
a
convent
for
a
lots
of
folks
do
that
in
france
instead
of
going
to
a
hospital
or
sanitarium
as
they
do
here
i
did
think
from
the
way
she
spoke
she
even
knew
who
it
was
who
had
been
killed
you
better
believe
did
say
anything
about
who
it
was
either
i
wanted
to
go
easy
and
find
out
how
things
were
i
kept
my
ears
and
eyes
open
but
i
did
get
anything
that
would
give
me
a
lead
from
marise
except
that
i
found
that
her
had
piled
right
in
and
stayed
by
her
till
i
got
there
and
i
was
pretty
sure
she
would
have
told
marise
anything
and
would
have
kept
anybody
else
mouth
shut
it
came
out
casually
for
one
thing
that
she
had
sequestered
that
newspaper
i
saw
before
marise
had
a
chance
to
look
at
it
well
it
looked
as
though
the
first
thing
was
to
get
flora
home
where
i
could
stand
guard
over
her
till
the
thing
blew
over
he
burst
out
savagely
good
god
how
was
i
to
dream
that
she
was
so
sick
he
made
some
violent
gesture
which
his
old
kinswoman
felt
but
could
not
see
in
the
darkness
but
she
was
when
we
went
to
see
her
that
afternoon
the
doctor
was
there
with
her
and
told
me
there
was
a
chance
in
a
thousand
for
her
double
pneumonia
we
saw
her
for
a
moment
that
afternoon
and
the
minute
marise
went
to
bed
that
evening
i
went
back
but
i
was
too
late
hetty
you
never
saw
anything
like
how
young
she
looked
like
a
little
girl
as
if
she
died
without
having
lived
the
nice
old
sister
who
had
taken
care
of
her
had
put
flowers
around
her
white
roses
and
she
was
crying
she
was
about
the
only
friend
flora
had
the
only
one
of
them
who
want
something
out
of
her
cousin
hetty
face
was
wet
with
tears
but
she
let
them
fall
silently
not
stirring
a
hand
to
wipe
them
away
her
cousin
stirred
a
great
deal
moving
restlessly
on
the
bench
folding
and
refolding
his
arms
impatiently
the
next
three
days
i
never
went
through
such
a
crazy
performance
enough
to
drive
a
man
out
of
his
mind
the
i
told
you
about
took
marise
off
with
her
up
to
the
mountains
somewhere
where
her
old
home
was
until
the
day
of
the
funeral
i
do
know
how
i
could
have
managed
without
that
i
have
had
marise
around
while
i
was
trying
to
hush
up
the
coroner
men
or
whoever
they
were
as
soon
as
i
got
in
touch
with
the
dead
boy
family
i
found
out
where
a
lot
of
the
trouble
came
from
the
police
had
come
down
from
saint
sauveur
just
as
a
matter
of
routine
to
go
through
the
motions
of
an
investigation
and
had
gone
to
where
we
lived
because
they
thought
flora
was
there
but
she
gone
to
the
convent
so
they
saw
our
old
cook
and
asked
her
a
lot
of
questions
and
jeanne
instead
of
telling
the
truth
which
was
that
she
did
know
a
thing
about
it
saw
a
chance
for
some
tall
and
fancy
lying
such
as
she
made
a
specialty
of
she
got
off
a
long
story
about
how
she
met
the
boy
on
his
way
to
the
train
and
he
told
her
he
was
going
on
business
and
marise
had
asked
him
to
take
a
message
to
her
mother
and
he
said
her
mother
did
know
him
by
sight
oh
god
knows
what
i
take
it
she
thought
she
was
the
family
honor
by
making
out
that
flora
did
know
the
young
man
but
she
certainly
got
everything
tied
up
into
knots
she
beat
it
off
to
tell
the
dead
boy
family
what
she
told
the
police
so
their
lies
would
be
of
the
same
color
as
hers
oh
it
was
the
damnedest
of
course
they
were
all
set
to
do
their
share
of
lying
they
wanted
as
much
as
i
did
to
keep
the
police
out
of
it
jeanne
had
beat
them
to
it
and
so
they
repeated
her
version
rather
than
start
something
new
but
naturally
rattled
as
they
were
with
the
suddenness
of
it
they
get
it
exactly
straight
and
that
started
the
police
off
on
an
idea
they
had
had
before
that
maybe
there
was
something
more
in
it
than
met
the
eye
they
asked
some
other
questions
around
in
bayonne
and
then
it
was
all
up
of
course
jeanne
story
could
hold
water
for
a
minute
they
found
out
first
that
he
had
any
business
that
could
possibly
have
taken
him
up
to
the
mountains
and
the
old
hag
that
kept
a
on
our
street
said
he
had
sat
all
the
evening
before
flora
went
away
on
the
bench
across
the
street
from
our
house
that
she
sold
him
some
flowers
at
eight
when
she
shut
her
stall
and
when
she
came
back
at
six
the
next
morning
he
was
there
again
and
our
concierge
said
oh
hell
you
need
to
know
all
the
details
everybody
was
lying
and
everybody
sure
that
everybody
else
was
and
those
fool
police
inspectors
were
sure
they
unearth
something
if
they
only
kept
on
inside
hours
i
saw
there
was
no
sort
of
chance
of
getting
anything
straightened
out
by
getting
down
to
the
facts
which
did
amount
to
a
whoop
anyhow
so
we
did
what
you
always
do
in
france
when
you
want
to
get
anything
done
we
used
a
pull
garnier
this
boy
father
was
a
business
acquaintance
of
mine
and
quite
a
man
we
got
together
away
from
his
wife
she
was
just
crazy
over
her
son
death
from
one
day
to
the
next
she
looked
twenty
years
older
and
the
way
she
cursed
us
all
for
ever
coming
to
bayonne
not
that
i
cared
she
was
out
of
her
mind
anyhow
all
the
same
the
things
she
said
and
poor
flora
in
her
coffin
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
cast
his
dead
cigar
from
him
with
a
vivid
gesture
of
disgust
the
upshot
was
that
garnier
got
busy
the
right
way
he
furnished
the
political
pull
and
i
furnished
the
money
we
stopped
fooling
with
the
police
and
went
straight
to
the
préfet
and
they
passed
the
order
down
quick
from
one
office
to
another
to
have
that
inquest
settled
at
once
with
no
more
noise
when
that
hit
the
police
who
been
bothering
us
they
curled
up
and
dropped
off
i
bribed
a
reporter
and
the
editor
of
the
local
newspaper
and
when
the
brought
marise
back
to
the
funeral
the
whole
mess
was
buried
in
the
momentary
silence
which
followed
as
he
drew
breath
again
cousin
hetty
gave
way
he
could
feel
that
she
was
shaking
uncontrollably
and
hear
that
her
teeth
were
chattering
he
was
startled
having
forgotten
that
she
was
there
forgotten
that
this
was
anything
but
one
of
the
sick
silent
evocations
which
blackened
so
many
hours
for
him
great
scott
hetty
you
freezing
to
death
he
cried
helping
her
roughly
to
her
feet
why
under
the
sun
did
you
you
were
getting
cold
she
did
not
intimate
that
she
was
shaken
by
anything
but
a
physical
chill
stiff
and
bent
clinging
to
his
great
arm
unable
to
stop
the
nervous
chattering
of
her
teeth
she
hobbled
back
to
the
house
beside
him
the
light
from
the
fire
on
the
hearth
set
them
miles
apart
as
she
had
known
it
would
his
face
closed
shut
he
would
never
mention
all
this
to
her
again
he
was
irritated
that
he
had
spoken
he
blamed
her
because
he
had
spoken
but
she
cared
less
than
nothing
whether
she
were
blamed
or
not
as
soon
as
she
was
able
to
control
the
nervous
trembling
of
her
hands
and
lips
and
head
she
asked
how
much
does
marise
know
he
said
impatiently
i
do
know
i
have
any
idea
i
thought
perhaps
might
have
why
do
you
suppose
i
told
you
about
it
what
do
you
think
she
persisted
well
i
do
see
how
she
could
that
had
gone
directly
to
be
with
her
and
stayed
with
her
practically
every
minute
i
was
and
i
know
she
never
tell
her
anything
nor
let
anybody
else
but
you
never
know
you
never
know
there
are
a
million
underground
ways
in
france
especially
you
find
out
everything
you
ever
know
through
the
back
of
your
head
somehow
or
by
putting
two
and
two
together
that
nobody
meant
you
to
servants
gossip
though
thank
god
jeanne
had
a
stroke
of
paralysis
just
then
that
kept
her
from
saying
a
word
till
after
we
had
left
bayonne
if
jeanne
had
been
able
to
talk
i
have
been
that
marise
had
heard
forty
times
more
than
there
was
to
know
damn
jeanne
and
yet
she
have
died
to
get
marise
a
new
dress
or
something
good
to
eat
any
day
i
do
see
how
marise
have
heard
anything
and
of
course
if
she
did
least
said
soonest
mended
but
if
she
did
it
a
dead
sure
thing
she
got
it
all
twisted
and
i
suppose
she
ought
to
have
it
straightened
out
his
old
cousin
broke
in
with
a
rush
well
i
think
you
better
tell
her
and
felt
instantly
that
this
was
not
at
all
the
answer
he
had
wished
for
you
do
want
to
do
it
she
said
oh
i
never
want
to
do
anything
he
admitted
it
always
the
easiest
way
the
easiest
way
lands
you
in
some
pretty
hard
places
she
observed
he
made
no
comment
on
this
but
his
silence
did
not
save
him
from
her
further
going
on
look
where
it
landed
you
with
flora
he
was
stirred
to
a
moment
of
heat
what
are
you
talking
about
hetty
by
god
i
never
refused
flora
anything
she
wanted
if
you
call
the
easiest
way
she
flared
up
in
a
momentary
impatience
at
his
denseness
but
wasted
no
words
on
an
issue
no
longer
vital
well
i
think
you
better
tell
marise
she
repeated
stubbornly
he
set
this
on
one
side
for
a
moment
as
irrelevant
and
said
all
i
want
to
know
from
you
is
whether
you
ever
seen
a
sign
in
her
to
make
you
think
she
had
heard
anything
did
you
ever
notice
when
she
speaks
of
her
mother
or
whether
she
does
speak
she
scorned
as
he
knew
she
would
coloring
the
truth
to
win
a
point
no
i
never
did
she
stated
honestly
well
then
that
all
i
wanted
to
know
i
know
you
have
seen
it
if
it
were
there
she
been
so
much
with
you
but
i
think
you
ought
to
tell
her
she
persisted
why
under
the
heavens
he
asked
why
put
ideas
in
her
head
if
she
perfectly
all
right
i
think
everybody
ought
to
know
about
everything
she
answered
sweepingly
and
they
not
perfectly
all
right
unless
they
do
at
least
if
she
heard
anything
she
ought
to
know
that
you
blame
flora
that
you
do
think
there
was
anything
but
talk
you
could
talk
it
over
with
her
get
it
out
into
the
light
it
would
be
poisoning
her
mind
against
her
mother
to
mention
it
i
do
believe
cousin
hetty
held
to
her
point
steadily
pale
very
much
in
earnest
i
do
believe
that
the
truth
can
poison
mind
well
i
believe
in
using
ordinary
about
everything
he
said
conclusively
with
a
peremptory
accent
cousin
hetty
fell
back
from
this
brute
assertion
of
his
authority
you
made
up
your
mind
what
to
do
before
you
ever
spoke
to
me
she
told
him
not
without
bitterness
that
is
fair
i
did
know
enough
to
make
up
my
mind
you
told
me
what
i
needed
to
know
he
answered
i
wish
i
tell
you
what
you
need
to
know
she
flamed
out
at
him
but
she
evidently
found
it
useless
to
try
any
longer
and
sank
again
huddled
in
her
low
chair
he
got
up
carelessly
and
shook
himself
to
start
the
blood
through
his
great
frame
numbed
by
immobility
his
eye
was
caught
by
the
expression
of
the
old
woman
face
as
she
looked
up
at
him
he
stood
still
considering
her
you
going
to
miss
marise
he
said
she
turned
back
hastily
towards
the
fire
to
hide
the
sudden
trembling
of
her
lips
and
presently
said
in
a
dry
voice
all
i
want
is
for
her
to
have
what
is
best
for
her
he
agreed
to
this
with
relief
sure
so
do
i
poor
kid
never
asked
to
be
born
later
as
he
started
up
the
stairs
his
glass
kerosene
lamp
in
his
hand
he
said
you
know
hetty
as
well
as
i
do
that
it
does
make
any
difference
what
we
do
or
do
do
for
her
she
got
to
take
coming
to
her
just
like
everybody
else
his
cousin
looked
down
at
the
steady
commonplace
little
flame
of
her
own
lamp
i
do
suppose
i
ever
see
her
again
she
said
in
a
low
tone
of
profound
sadness
but
she
added
stoically
as
she
began
to
climb
the
stairs
after
him
not
that
that
makes
any
difference
to
anybody
but
me
chapter
xxxvii
paris
may
holá
allen
called
marthe
tollet
as
marise
passed
through
the
verandah
on
her
way
to
the
street
door
in
her
haste
to
stop
marise
she
used
the
abrupt
surname
hail
which
the
girls
thought
so
very
chic
and
truly
english
which
the
older
teachers
forbade
as
rude
and
barbarous
a
typical
manifestation
of
the
crumbling
down
of
civilized
french
ways
under
the
onslaught
of
modern
roughness
eh
bien
the
little
tollet
what
is
it
asked
marise
in
the
same
vernacular
pausing
in
front
of
the
concierge
door
marthe
left
the
swedish
ladder
where
she
was
twisting
her
flexible
young
body
in
and
out
of
the
rungs
and
coming
up
to
marise
remarked
casually
oh
i
just
thought
maybe
you
like
to
go
to
the
dormitory
and
see
that
little
compatriot
of
yours
she
crying
like
everything
la
pauvre
and
nobody
can
do
a
thing
with
her
the
pretty
little
girl
with
blonde
hair
asked
marise
somewhat
vague
as
to
the
younger
girls
in
the
lower
classes
what
the
matter
with
her
a
perfectly
horrible
attack
of
homesickness
they
say
the
english
teacher
is
up
there
she
the
only
one
who
can
talk
to
her
but
you
know
how
likely
the
macmurray
will
be
to
put
balm
on
a
sore
heart
eh
and
you
could
make
a
wooden
man
split
his
sides
laughing
once
you
get
started
could
cheer
her
up
marise
hesitated
looked
in
at
the
clock
in
the
concierge
loge
and
nodded
she
started
towards
the
door
of
the
dormitory
building
stopped
and
called
back
o
là
the
little
tollet
what
her
name
eugénie
said
the
other
eugénie
mille
as
she
climbed
the
dark
winding
stairs
marise
reflected
that
that
did
sound
like
an
american
name
and
made
a
guess
that
as
had
happened
to
her
before
she
would
find
that
the
american
girl
was
from
martinque
or
peru
or
saõ
paulo
but
it
was
english
sure
enough
that
miss
macmurray
was
talking
as
she
bent
over
the
sobbing
heap
on
the
narrow
iron
bed
she
was
saying
helplessly
there
now
it
verra
i
know
i
far
from
home
mysel
patting
the
heaving
shoulders
with
one
hand
and
anxiously
looking
at
her
watch
she
was
due
at
a
private
lesson
in
ten
minutes
and
a
private
lesson
meant
five
irreplaceable
francs
she
welcomed
the
tall
american
girl
with
relief
ah
that
right
that
right
you
know
how
to
get
her
quieted
down
and
fled
before
marise
could
protest
that
she
did
not
even
know
the
homesick
child
rather
at
a
loss
and
very
unenthusiastically
marise
stood
looking
down
on
the
crumpled
untidy
bed
and
the
mass
of
disordered
golden
hair
noting
the
fineness
of
the
tailored
blue
serge
and
the
excellently
made
small
shoes
they
were
unmistakably
north
american
in
their
shapeliness
nothing
peruvian
or
brazilian
about
them
what
could
you
do
for
somebody
who
was
homesick
she
certainly
did
not
know
from
experience
nobody
had
ever
done
anything
for
her
she
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
laid
her
arm
over
the
narrow
shoulders
and
said
cheerfully
hallo
there
what
the
matter
you
run
out
of
tears
if
you
are
careful
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
the
sobbing
stopped
abruptly
the
girl
on
the
bed
started
dashed
the
floating
brilliant
hair
from
her
face
and
turned
on
marise
blue
eyes
dimmed
with
tears
she
looked
exhausted
by
her
passion
of
sobbing
why
you
poor
kid
said
marise
compassionately
she
had
thought
it
was
as
serious
as
all
the
other
with
a
rough
scrambling
sprawl
got
herself
to
her
knees
and
sat
up
rubbing
the
tears
away
from
her
eyes
with
the
backs
of
her
hands
and
drawing
long
quivering
breaths
her
lips
were
swollen
her
cheeks
fiery
and
glazed
marise
was
touched
and
putting
out
her
arms
drew
the
other
into
them
here
you
must
let
me
help
you
get
used
to
things
been
homesick
too
the
girl
tried
to
speak
was
on
the
point
of
bursting
into
tears
again
struggled
wildly
to
get
the
better
of
her
excitement
and
emotion
and
finally
brought
out
in
a
strangled
voice
i
not
i
my
home
i
would
go
back
theah
for
the
words
in
themselves
were
sufficiently
astonishing
to
marise
and
the
raging
accent
with
which
they
were
cast
out
made
them
even
more
disconcerting
she
felt
that
the
little
quivering
body
in
her
arms
was
clinging
desperately
to
her
and
sat
silent
holding
the
unhappy
child
close
because
she
did
not
know
what
else
to
do
with
her
presently
however
she
ventured
to
ask
where
is
your
home
it
in
arkansas
said
the
other
in
a
muffled
defiant
tone
it
is
anywheah
now
it
heah
marise
not
being
very
intimately
acquainted
with
the
shades
and
phases
of
certain
american
prejudices
saw
nothing
peculiar
in
having
home
in
arkansas
why
not
apparently
some
hint
of
this
reached
the
other
for
after
a
moment
of
silent
expectant
tension
she
lifted
her
face
from
marise
shoulder
and
looked
up
searchingly
into
her
face
how
pretty
she
must
be
thought
marise
when
she
had
been
crying
she
must
look
like
a
pink
lily
in
the
midst
of
the
little
girls
of
her
class
have
you
any
of
your
family
here
in
paris
with
you
she
asked
now
i
have
any
family
left
only
some
lawyers
and
guardians
and
things
said
the
other
she
spoke
as
though
she
were
glad
of
it
marise
thought
so
that
she
suppressed
the
of
sympathy
which
she
was
on
the
point
of
uttering
what
a
strange
little
thing
the
strange
little
thing
now
looked
up
at
her
do
you
know
what
i
was
crying
for
just
now
she
said
marise
could
not
understand
why
she
asked
this
in
an
accusing
tone
of
blame
no
said
marise
as
utterly
at
a
loss
as
ever
in
her
life
how
could
i
because
i
hate
myself
so
because
i
hate
my
looks
and
my
clothes
and
the
other
burst
out
passionately
i
feel
like
po
white
trash
they
had
plenty
of
money
why
did
they
send
me
here
befoah
cried
marise
why
you
only
a
child
now
i
almost
as
old
as
you
are
said
the
other
i
seventeen
and
you
eighteen
she
flung
it
out
like
a
grievance
eh
cried
marise
in
great
astonishment
she
had
not
thought
the
other
girl
over
fourteen
she
said
now
sitting
up
straight
and
looking
wistfully
at
marise
you
be
friends
you
came
of
your
own
accord
to
be
nice
to
me
tell
me
about
things
i
want
so
like
sin
to
know
i
do
anything
to
learn
know
what
asked
marise
bewildered
looking
about
her
as
if
she
might
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
things
the
other
wanted
to
know
what
they
all
know
oveh
heah
everything
know
marise
drew
back
with
an
abrupt
gesture
no
she
cried
her
face
darkening
the
words
leaping
out
before
she
could
stop
them
oh
i
do
mean
your
secrets
i
do
care
about
that
and
i
mean
the
way
you
play
the
piano
although
i
know
some
of
the
girls
are
envious
of
that
and
i
despise
to
have
to
study
as
hard
as
in
the
upper
classes
do
i
mean
the
right
way
to
sit
down
and
hold
your
hands
and
speak
and
weah
clothes
marise
began
to
laugh
do
know
how
to
wear
clothes
what
do
you
want
anyhow
you
prettier
than
any
girl
in
the
school
and
you
are
wearing
a
dress
that
cost
more
than
anybody
else
and
finer
shoes
than
you
could
buy
in
all
paris
but
they
not
right
the
girl
said
petulantly
or
else
i
them
right
or
something
i
hate
them
i
have
lots
of
money
but
i
do
know
how
to
buy
what
i
want
she
flung
herself
again
on
marise
holding
her
closely
help
me
she
begged
help
me
buy
what
i
want
marise
was
touched
by
the
loneliness
which
underlay
the
other
appeal
she
knew
what
it
was
to
be
lonely
it
was
the
first
time
that
any
one
had
broken
through
into
her
loneliness
as
this
quivering
passionate
unhappy
little
thing
had
done
the
first
time
anybody
had
asked
her
for
help
from
the
very
first
word
of
their
talk
the
light
chaffing
manner
which
was
her
usual
shield
had
been
torn
into
shreds
by
the
other
girl
driving
directness
she
looked
deep
into
the
eyes
fixed
breathlessly
on
her
and
said
seriously
yes
eugénie
help
you
all
i
can
there
said
the
other
that
a
specimen
my
name
not
eugénie
eugenia
is
that
turrible
marise
did
not
follow
this
at
all
it
just
the
same
thing
only
in
english
is
it
yes
but
it
horrid
and
common
in
english
and
it
lovely
in
french
why
ca
i
it
eugénie
she
looked
up
keenly
and
searchingly
into
marise
face
and
at
what
she
caught
there
she
contradicted
herself
hastily
before
marise
could
open
her
lips
no
no
i
see
it
would
be
silly
to
change
it
to
pretend
i
better
make
the
best
of
it
there
there
one
fool
mistake
you
kept
me
from
making
you
see
marise
felt
that
the
talk
was
on
a
plane
different
from
hers
so
that
she
did
not
get
its
meaning
although
the
words
were
clear
enough
what
was
all
that
about
eugenia
and
eugénie
she
had
caught
the
point
of
that
at
all
being
only
eighteen
she
found
her
bewilderment
rather
comic
and
began
to
laugh
i
still
do
see
that
eugenia
is
just
as
good
as
eugénie
she
said
i
honestly
do
know
what
you
talking
about
eugenia
but
if
do
it
all
right
oh
do
said
the
other
with
conviction
marise
was
relieved
to
see
that
her
small
pretty
face
although
still
flushed
from
her
fit
of
tears
no
longer
looked
distraught
how
strange
thought
marise
they
had
never
spoken
a
word
to
each
other
ten
minutes
before
and
now
they
were
sitting
side
by
side
hand
in
hand
like
sisters
i
awfully
glad
i
came
in
she
said
so
am
i
said
eugenia
i
been
just
crazy
to
talk
to
you
but
so
many
classes
higher
than
me
oh
how
i
my
class
to
be
put
back
with
all
those
young
ones
and
study
such
stupid
things
and
the
teacher
such
an
old
frump
and
i
not
having
of
what
i
want
i
not
getting
on
a
bit
what
do
i
care
what
france
did
in
india
before
the
english
got
there
i
did
come
to
france
to
learn
those
sort
of
things
marise
please
can
i
call
you
marise
do
you
suppose
i
speak
french
as
you
do
why
of
course
marise
answered
her
reasonably
everybody
does
who
lives
here
why
should
you
the
echo
of
the
famished
burning
accent
of
the
other
struck
now
oddly
on
her
ear
she
repeated
of
course
you
will
if
you
care
to
and
went
on
but
why
should
you
bother
to
care
so
much
what
difference
does
it
make
they
do
bother
themselves
to
learn
english
eugenia
flashed
a
look
of
quick
astonishment
at
her
apparently
this
was
an
entirely
new
idea
to
her
after
an
instant
silent
consideration
of
it
she
flung
it
away
with
the
aggrieved
cry
oh
but
you
you
as
though
thought
marise
that
incapacitated
her
from
having
a
valid
opinion
about
it
but
this
too
like
the
discussion
had
somehow
taken
place
in
another
dimension
than
the
one
she
knew
she
was
not
allowed
to
ponder
the
question
however
receiving
at
this
point
another
impassioned
embrace
from
eugenia
who
cried
you
do
how
glad
i
am
you
came
now
it
be
all
right
and
been
so
miserable
let
talk
let
talk
i
must
soon
be
going
to
a
said
marise
glancing
at
the
little
watch
which
hung
on
a
black
ribbon
around
the
other
girl
neck
eugenia
caught
at
her
despairingly
oh
do
go
away
i
yet
i
have
said
a
then
struck
by
another
possibility
ca
i
go
with
you
we
could
talk
in
the
cab
and
i
would
say
a
word
at
your
lesson
yes
let
me
i
was
going
to
take
a
cab
protested
marise
i
do
go
round
in
cabs
except
when
i
dressed
up
in
the
evenings
it
would
be
pretty
expensive
ma
foi
to
take
a
cab
everywhere
i
went
in
the
daytime
mostly
i
walk
oh
i
hate
to
walk
let
take
the
cab
the
other
girl
begged
beginning
hastily
to
arrange
her
hair
i
got
plenty
of
money
the
only
thing
i
have
got
she
paused
the
brush
in
her
hand
you
she
asked
addressing
herself
to
marise
reflection
in
the
glass
marise
was
passably
astonished
at
the
unceremonious
question
but
answered
it
simply
i
have
any
of
my
own
i
live
with
my
father
and
he
has
any
either
but
he
makes
a
good
deal
gets
a
good
salary
i
mean
he
lets
me
have
all
i
need
eugenia
comment
on
this
was
to
say
bitterly
think
of
not
knowing
more
than
to
ask
such
a
question
i
told
you
i
do
know
anything
but
i
can
learn
i
can
learn
in
a
minute
if
only
i
get
the
chance
i
learned
then
from
the
way
you
looked
i
never
make
fool
mistake
again
she
pinned
on
a
very
pretty
costly
hat
and
marise
saw
that
she
really
did
not
look
like
a
child
after
all
she
ran
her
arm
under
now
and
gave
it
an
ecstatic
squeeze
oh
i
so
happy
she
cried
i
wish
i
could
buy
you
a
diamond
necklace
the
talk
in
the
cab
as
they
clattered
over
the
big
of
the
quiet
streets
turned
on
the
school
and
very
soon
marise
was
led
to
say
but
see
here
i
do
believe
eugenia
you
got
into
the
right
school
at
it
not
a
bit
chic
you
know
to
go
to
a
girl
lycée
and
ours
is
one
of
the
plainest
of
them
all
the
teachers
are
terrible
grinds
the
girls
are
fearfully
they
do
care
a
thing
about
their
looks
all
they
want
is
to
pass
the
competitive
exams
for
the
ecole
normale
at
sèvres
and
get
in
there
for
four
more
years
of
grind
lots
and
lots
worse
than
at
the
lycée
you
better
believe
there
nothing
what
france
did
in
india
before
the
english
got
there
et
ainsi
de
suite
eugenia
made
a
gesture
of
despair
she
lamented
that
it
not
even
to
know
enough
to
pick
out
the
right
school
and
then
a
curious
expression
of
suspicion
coming
into
her
eyes
she
said
skeptically
but
go
to
that
school
if
it
good
enough
for
you
here
again
was
something
in
that
baffling
other
dimension
and
this
time
though
she
understood
it
as
little
as
ever
marise
did
not
like
it
at
all
she
said
stiffly
i
going
because
you
can
get
serious
instruction
in
some
things
i
need
to
enter
the
classes
at
the
sorbonne
next
year
eugenia
sprang
at
her
remorsefully
crying
i
wo
again
i
do
know
what
made
me
she
kissed
her
once
more
rubbing
her
cheek
against
the
other
shoulder
her
bewildering
alternations
of
mood
the
reckless
way
in
which
she
threw
herself
on
marise
to
embrace
her
and
the
way
very
startling
to
a
girl
brought
up
in
france
in
which
eugenia
kissed
her
on
the
mouth
like
a
lover
were
very
exciting
to
marise
not
since
jeanne
big
double
kisses
had
she
been
so
fondled
and
caressed
and
never
had
she
been
kissed
on
the
lips
before
that
was
something
closely
associated
in
her
mind
with
secrecy
and
passion
it
made
her
feel
very
queer
partly
and
startled
partly
moved
and
responsive
altogether
shaken
up
more
alive
but
apprehensively
uncertain
of
what
was
coming
next
and
what
the
sorbonne
it
the
university
marise
explained
i
was
through
a
woman
college
in
america
when
we
came
abroad
again
so
i
wanted
to
go
on
and
study
some
more
here
although
i
have
to
work
so
many
hours
a
day
on
my
music
that
i
ca
ever
hope
to
have
a
degree
college
university
eugenia
was
horrified
mercy
what
makes
you
want
to
do
that
and
music
lessons
too
i
should
think
you
be
working
every
minute
i
do
said
marise
just
study
study
study
and
practise
practise
practise
asked
the
other
astonished
mostly
said
marise
why
that
cried
eugenia
beginning
to
look
alarmed
that
the
way
everybody
does
over
here
said
marise
they
cried
eugenia
aghast
and
astounded
why
i
thought
they
marise
corrected
herself
oh
of
course
not
what
am
i
talking
about
i
mean
the
kind
of
folks
i
know
there
are
millions
of
others
i
suppose
yes
of
course
all
the
rue
de
la
paix
clientèle
who
do
work
at
all
eugenia
was
relieved
at
this
and
relapsed
for
a
moment
into
silence
which
she
finally
broke
by
asking
well
wheah
you
go
to
school
if
you
were
me
marise
had
been
thinking
of
this
and
was
ready
there
a
very
grand
private
school
i
heard
about
out
at
auteuil
in
what
was
country
estate
when
auteuil
was
the
country
with
a
château
and
a
park
it
fearfully
expensive
and
so
it
must
be
very
chic
the
girls
never
go
out
by
themselves
always
have
a
maid
or
a
teacher
with
them
the
old
ideas
aristocratic
you
know
that
ordinary
french
people
do
hold
to
any
more
marbury
could
tell
you
all
about
it
who
mrs
mahbury
oh
she
an
american
who
always
lived
over
here
in
the
american
colony
her
husband
and
my
father
are
in
the
same
sort
of
business
we
know
her
she
be
to
know
what
was
chic
well
i
go
to
that
school
announced
eugenia
i
just
there
be
a
place
like
that
if
i
could
only
find
out
wheah
i
bet
you
i
wo
have
to
study
french
history
marise
laughed
you
probably
have
to
work
like
a
dog
for
the
teacher
who
teaches
what
that
oh
all
i
know
about
it
is
what
the
dancing
teacher
used
to
make
us
do
in
the
i
went
to
in
bayonne
walk
into
a
room
pretend
to
greet
somebody
step
into
a
carriage
and
out
of
it
sit
down
with
him
for
a
talk
and
first
he
pretend
to
be
a
girl
like
you
and
then
he
pretend
to
be
an
older
woman
and
then
he
pretend
to
be
a
man
only
of
course
he
really
was
that
and
you
have
to
have
the
right
manner
for
each
one
all
that
kind
of
foolishness
you
know
no
i
do
know
cried
eugenia
angrily
the
cab
drew
up
and
stopped
i
suppose
we
theah
said
eugenia
you
tell
him
to
wait
till
we
come
out
she
was
cautiously
silent
during
the
introduction
to
mme
de
la
cueva
and
during
the
hour
of
the
lesson
but
if
she
gave
her
tongue
little
employment
she
kept
her
eyes
busy
absorbing
every
detail
of
the
long
bare
room
with
its
four
long
windows
opening
on
a
balcony
overlooking
the
little
dank
unkempt
jardin
de
cluny
after
the
lesson
mme
de
la
cueva
stepped
into
another
room
to
get
some
music
and
marise
rather
pale
with
fatigue
walked
wearily
out
on
the
balcony
for
a
breath
of
fresh
air
eugenia
sprang
to
follow
her
as
if
she
had
been
wishing
to
do
this
and
had
not
known
if
it
were
allowable
but
before
she
looked
down
on
the
medieval
building
below
them
she
said
in
a
whisper
to
marise
you
why
i
would
work
that
hard
for
and
for
that
fat
old
dowd
marise
looked
down
at
her
astonished
i
not
working
for
she
exclaimed
but
this
was
evidently
from
the
look
of
eugenia
face
a
fourth
dimensional
remark
for
her
for
she
made
no
answer
turning
instead
to
look
at
the
old
mass
of
cluny
what
is
it
eugenia
asked
marise
had
not
yet
wholly
emerged
from
a
struggle
with
an
exercise
which
she
had
not
been
able
to
execute
with
the
inhuman
velocity
demanded
by
mme
de
la
cueva
the
hour
in
that
other
world
to
which
music
always
transported
her
had
broken
the
continuity
of
her
impressions
of
her
new
friend
she
stared
rather
blankly
at
question
and
looked
from
her
to
the
medieval
pile
below
them
it
did
not
for
the
instant
occur
to
her
that
the
other
girl
did
not
recognize
what
the
building
was
the
turn
of
her
phrase
suggested
an
inquiry
about
the
architecture
and
though
she
had
never
thought
about
cluny
before
the
look
of
it
stirred
recollections
of
a
certain
fierce
history
teacher
whose
specialty
had
been
the
transitions
of
the
reign
of
louis
xii
she
looked
down
on
the
stone
lacework
opposite
and
said
doubtfully
what
is
it
domestic
gothic
should
you
think
but
some
of
it
pretty
late
those
square
are
louis
douze
they
she
looked
away
from
the
cluny
and
down
at
eugenia
as
she
finished
and
had
once
more
a
shock
of
astonishment
the
other
eyes
were
flaming
theah
that
it
she
said
fiercely
showing
her
white
teeth
as
she
spoke
but
not
in
a
smile
that
it
that
it
did
you
learn
that
she
dashed
the
question
in
marise
face
as
though
it
had
been
her
fist
marise
positively
drew
back
from
her
too
startled
to
be
anything
but
literal
she
answered
why
why
i
do
know
where
i
did
oh
yes
in
my
french
history
class
i
suppose
they
make
you
learn
everything
so
hard
you
know
you
yourself
were
saying
what
a
grind
it
is
eugenia
breathed
hard
and
said
history
again
darn
it
but
i
dream
you
learn
sort
of
thing
in
it
she
added
defiantly
and
for
marise
quite
cryptically
well
going
to
learn
it
without
mme
de
la
cueva
came
back
with
the
music
in
her
hand
voilà
mon
enfant
she
said
shaking
marise
hand
heartily
she
reached
for
eugenia
hand
too
which
was
hanging
at
her
side
till
eugenia
seeing
the
meaning
of
the
other
gesture
brought
it
up
with
an
awkward
haste
a
painful
red
burning
in
her
cheeks
some
one
came
in
as
they
went
out
another
student
evidently
for
he
had
a
roll
of
music
in
his
hand
he
stopped
and
stood
aside
with
a
deep
bow
to
let
the
two
girls
pass
mlle
allen
he
said
looking
at
her
intently
boudoin
she
answered
neither
girl
spoke
as
they
went
down
the
endless
winding
stairs
and
passed
out
to
the
street
as
they
turned
into
the
boulevard
and
jogged
past
the
jardin
de
cluny
eugenia
asked
tensely
what
are
those
walls
marise
answered
circumspectly
fearing
another
i
think
they
roman
ruins
what
left
of
the
baths
the
romans
had
here
eugenia
made
no
answer
but
looked
at
them
hard
marise
went
on
awfully
interesting
is
it
to
see
roman
ruins
right
in
paris
across
the
street
from
a
café
but
i
suppose
they
look
like
small
potatoes
to
anybody
who
seen
rome
mme
vallery
says
they
look
comically
small
after
rome
eugenia
put
her
arm
around
her
neck
and
kissed
her
once
more
fervently
disturbingly
on
the
lips
would
you
like
to
go
to
rome
i
you
to
rome
i
hire
a
private
car
for
the
two
of
us
and
before
marise
could
answer
before
she
could
even
bring
out
the
laugh
which
rose
to
her
lips
eugenia
said
with
another
of
her
abrupt
leaps
that
young
man
is
in
love
with
you
the
one
who
came
in
afterwards
he
awfully
too
she
looked
into
face
with
her
avid
penetrating
gaze
and
said
but
you
do
like
him
i
never
thought
about
him
in
my
life
cried
marise
exasperated
she
was
beginning
to
feel
desperately
tired
of
the
mental
gymnastics
of
such
talk
but
there
was
something
you
did
like
as
i
spoke
about
him
do
you
men
do
you
like
men
to
be
in
love
with
you
i
do
i
love
it
she
made
another
flying
leap
and
asked
are
many
french
women
like
your
so
fat
no
style
she
not
french
madame
de
la
cueva
what
then
a
levantine
a
what
what
a
levantine
marise
considered
what
a
levantine
anyhow
a
little
of
everything
i
should
say
and
all
more
or
less
oriental
and
southern
she
part
spanish
part
jewish
from
asia
minor
brought
up
in
cairo
and
paris
eugenia
sheered
off
on
another
tack
and
who
is
madame
va
va
something
madame
vallery
she
a
she
a
sort
of
friend
of
mine
yes
a
friend
my
old
when
i
was
a
little
girl
got
us
together
she
the
wife
of
a
deputy
you
know
like
our
congressmen
is
she
chic
too
asked
eugenia
like
marbury
is
she
young
is
she
pretty
marise
laughed
no
she
not
pretty
or
young
she
must
be
fifty
years
old
eugenia
was
shocked
and
a
friend
of
marise
explained
she
has
more
brains
than
you
and
i
and
forty
other
girls
rolled
into
one
and
i
met
more
interesting
people
at
her
house
than
will
you
take
me
sometime
will
you
take
me
asked
eugenia
yes
if
you
like
said
marise
eugenia
looked
around
her
wildly
as
if
to
find
some
way
of
saying
her
thanks
something
in
the
street
caught
her
eye
they
were
passing
a
florist
shop
she
slammed
the
door
open
curved
her
flexible
little
body
around
the
frame
and
caught
at
the
driver
stop
a
minute
she
cried
to
him
and
dashed
into
the
shop
when
she
came
out
she
had
a
huge
bunch
of
orchids
in
her
arms
for
you
for
you
she
cried
elated
at
her
idea
thrusting
them
into
marise
hands
and
kissing
her
again
and
then
suddenly
downcast
oh
it
ought
to
have
been
orchids
what
roses
lilies
violets
yes
violets
this
time
marise
protested
energetically
against
this
assumption
of
meanings
in
her
face
i
do
know
what
makes
you
such
things
she
cried
out
helplessly
orchids
are
lovely
how
could
anything
be
better
i
never
had
any
before
in
my
life
but
the
other
was
not
to
be
comforted
yes
it
ought
to
have
been
violets
she
murmured
and
then
squaring
her
jaw
and
it
be
violets
the
next
time
you
just
see
chapter
xxxviii
may
as
marise
started
up
the
front
stairway
she
saw
biron
emerging
on
the
run
from
the
foot
of
the
servants
stairway
his
apron
a
net
in
his
hand
his
broad
red
face
looked
cross
and
anxious
something
must
have
gone
wrong
she
turned
back
meeting
him
in
front
of
the
concierge
door
oh
mademoiselle
god
be
praised
you
back
in
time
desolation
and
ruin
the
sole
has
turned
it
has
been
so
hot
i
swear
on
my
soul
as
a
christian
it
was
fresh
when
i
got
it
unless
that
blackguard
gagnan
changed
when
biron
turned
his
torrent
of
objurgation
on
the
tradespeople
who
sold
him
eatables
there
was
no
stopping
him
marise
cut
in
now
were
you
going
out
for
another
do
you
want
me
to
go
yes
yes
only
not
for
a
sole
there
would
be
one
left
and
the
dinner
was
for
sole
he
ground
his
teeth
white
and
sound
as
a
wolf
i
could
send
mélanie
if
she
had
the
intelligence
of
an
and
yet
to
leave
her
with
my
sauce
till
i
get
back
i
was
right
in
the
midst
of
a
for
the
he
turned
as
if
to
rush
back
upstairs
distractedly
and
turned
again
as
if
to
rush
distractedly
out
into
the
street
marise
put
out
her
hand
for
the
and
spoke
with
the
peremptory
decision
that
was
always
necessary
to
unloosen
biron
from
his
temperamental
tangles
go
right
back
to
your
sauce
biron
i
have
the
fish
here
in
five
minutes
and
have
plenty
of
onion
in
that
sauce
my
father
thought
the
last
not
too
much
vinegar
he
likes
his
sauces
suave
but
not
a
sole
mademoiselle
not
a
sole
any
sole
that
is
left
on
the
market
at
six
of
the
evening
is
left
because
nobody
would
buy
it
but
the
dinner
was
for
sole
he
stamped
his
huge
feet
in
exasperation
a
mackerel
suggested
marise
they
good
at
this
time
of
the
year
he
flung
his
arms
over
his
head
a
a
gross
fat
dark
monster
like
a
mackerel
to
replace
a
oh
no
of
course
not
marise
saw
his
point
i
did
think
nor
salmon
of
course
he
shuddered
away
from
the
idea
of
salmon
they
stood
staring
at
each
other
thinking
hard
the
cook
big
parboiled
fist
clenched
on
his
mouth
his
brows
knit
together
like
those
of
the
some
merlans
suggested
marise
you
can
cook
them
just
a
sole
but
will
i
have
time
he
groaned
who
knows
whether
the
oven
is
hot
enough
well
hurry
back
and
brighten
the
fire
while
i
rush
out
and
get
the
fish
he
fled
back
up
the
stairs
his
slippers
flapping
she
left
her
roll
of
music
in
the
concierge
care
and
darted
out
into
the
street
in
hand
twenty
minutes
later
the
fish
were
being
disposed
with
a
religious
care
on
a
bed
of
chopped
parsley
shallots
mushrooms
and
butter
biron
shoved
the
tenderly
into
the
oven
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
face
and
stopped
storming
at
his
wife
you
were
not
to
blame
after
all
mélanie
he
told
her
magnanimously
and
with
a
long
breath
but
it
was
a
close
call
by
god
a
close
call
in
the
salon
marise
was
pouring
an
apéritif
for
her
father
brightly
dishing
up
the
news
of
the
day
with
the
sauce
of
lively
comment
and
saying
nothing
about
culinary
close
calls
her
father
listened
to
her
sipping
his
dubonnet
with
an
air
of
intense
satisfaction
he
took
plenty
of
time
for
it
allowing
each
mouthful
to
deliver
all
its
complicated
burden
of
tang
and
bitterness
and
heat
before
he
took
another
one
into
his
mouth
excellent
stuff
dubonnet
he
said
appreciatively
i
glad
you
like
it
said
marise
she
envied
her
father
his
enjoyments
they
were
comparatively
speaking
so
easy
to
get
looking
at
her
seemed
to
remind
him
of
something
he
reached
into
a
vest
pocket
with
some
difficulty
for
his
vests
were
more
and
more
tightly
packed
with
each
year
of
good
living
and
took
out
a
little
box
it
your
birthday
he
remarked
taking
another
careful
sip
of
his
apéritif
marise
looked
at
the
present
a
little
from
a
very
good
house
oh
that
awfully
good
of
you
father
she
said
trying
it
on
you
can
have
one
if
that
funny
little
friend
of
yours
can
he
advanced
oh
if
you
start
giving
me
everything
eugenia
has
protested
marise
somebody
ought
to
make
a
present
of
a
little
ordinary
sense
he
commented
with
no
great
interest
in
the
subject
i
seen
her
kind
before
they
tear
things
loose
till
they
get
what
they
want
and
then
they
do
like
it
eugenia
just
loves
it
every
bit
of
it
marise
objected
well
let
her
he
dismissed
her
from
consideration
with
his
usual
nonchalance
and
taking
the
last
of
the
dubonnet
he
rose
to
go
into
his
room
in
a
moment
marise
heard
an
indignant
roar
has
forgotten
my
hot
water
again
her
father
came
to
the
door
of
his
room
vast
and
bulging
in
his
shirt
and
trousers
outraged
by
the
oversight
oh
yes
said
marise
in
annoyance
you
might
have
known
she
would
biron
has
been
in
another
tantrum
and
taking
her
head
off
it
gets
her
so
rattled
she
forgets
her
own
work
i
do
see
what
that
has
to
do
with
hot
cried
the
master
of
the
house
aggrieved
it
has
it
has
cried
marise
hastily
running
to
tell
mélanie
of
her
crime
not
till
the
hot
water
was
safely
delivered
and
her
father
comments
on
bad
service
diminished
to
a
distant
solitary
mutter
did
marise
go
into
her
own
room
to
dress
she
had
no
hot
water
either
but
she
washed
in
cold
scorning
with
all
her
heart
the
childishness
of
men
and
laughing
childishly
at
the
picture
her
father
had
made
shouting
and
indignant
billowing
in
his
shirt
and
trousers
he
and
biron
one
had
always
to
be
smoothing
them
down
and
wrapping
them
up
in
the
little
things
they
wanted
it
must
be
truly
lovely
to
be
married
to
one
as
poor
mélanie
was
but
after
all
father
did
his
best
to
be
good
to
her
when
everything
about
the
house
was
all
right
and
he
could
think
of
it
she
hoped
the
dinner
would
be
all
right
it
was
too
bad
about
that
sole
sole
was
so
expensive
too
not
that
father
ever
objected
to
anything
the
table
cost
oh
she
had
forgotten
to
see
if
biron
had
exchanged
that
bénédictine
for
chartreuse
father
would
raise
the
roof
if
they
served
him
bénédictine
again
she
put
on
her
dress
hurriedly
and
hooking
it
up
as
she
went
she
stepped
hastily
down
the
hall
to
the
kitchen
she
never
had
any
help
from
mélanie
in
dressing
not
even
costumes
that
hooked
up
on
the
shoulders
and
under
the
arms
because
it
was
important
not
to
disturb
the
small
quantity
of
gray
matter
mélanie
had
at
the
hour
of
serving
a
meal
it
was
all
needed
for
the
matter
in
hand
dinner
was
over
and
had
been
acceptable
her
father
had
partaken
of
everything
with
his
careful
appraising
attention
and
had
found
no
adverse
comment
to
make
coffee
had
been
served
and
the
chartreuse
biron
had
not
forgotten
out
in
the
kitchen
biron
first
taught
by
much
experience
loosening
the
sash
which
bound
his
mighty
paunch
was
sitting
with
his
wife
at
table
eating
and
drinking
like
a
page
out
of
rabelais
the
dinner
had
pleased
his
exacting
and
irritable
master
biron
immensely
respected
him
for
being
exacting
and
irritable
and
it
also
had
pleased
biron
there
was
plenty
of
it
left
and
this
was
a
house
where
the
cook
was
never
subjected
to
the
indignity
of
having
inquiries
made
about
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
undid
the
button
at
his
throat
and
smiled
at
his
wife
over
his
glass
of
excellent
burgundy
life
is
good
hein
old
lady
he
said
she
nodded
in
agreement
keeping
her
thoughts
to
herself
in
the
usual
stealthy
secretive
feminine
fashion
over
the
coffee
and
chartreuse
facing
another
man
sat
another
secretive
woman
talking
in
one
key
feeling
in
another
and
finding
the
process
far
from
enlivening
down
below
the
surface
of
the
sparkling
chatting
marise
drooped
a
listless
dispirited
marise
for
whom
a
birthday
was
a
most
depressing
occasion
you
nineteen
are
you
marise
asked
her
father
over
his
cigar
marise
nodded
well
that
another
one
gone
congratulations
on
every
one
you
get
over
with
he
commented
sipping
the
stinging
green
fire
of
his
liqueur
with
satisfaction
marise
thought
of
nothing
amusing
to
say
and
was
silent
her
father
stirred
his
big
body
with
the
air
of
some
one
arousing
himself
to
an
effort
the
effort
seemed
to
be
to
say
is
there
anything
you
want
i
can
get
for
you
his
daughter
was
at
a
loss
before
the
comprehensiveness
of
this
blanket
question
what
kind
of
a
thing
she
inquired
he
professed
himself
more
at
a
loss
than
she
if
i
had
any
idea
what
i
would
need
to
ask
you
would
i
but
he
managed
all
the
same
at
least
to
eliminate
some
of
the
things
he
did
mean
oh
not
dresses
or
hats
and
in
a
moment
after
another
sip
at
the
liqueur
to
give
a
little
more
definite
idea
of
what
he
did
something
going
on
social
life
what
girls
of
nineteen
are
supposed
to
want
oh
you
need
bother
i
get
enough
of
that
she
answered
between
marbury
and
eugenia
and
madame
vallery
she
was
surprised
at
her
father
interest
they
seldom
talked
together
except
of
what
they
were
to
eat
had
eaten
or
were
eating
or
of
the
interminable
games
of
chess
which
occupied
any
leisure
moments
of
his
and
hers
which
chanced
to
coincide
he
seemed
to
have
something
on
his
mind
now
and
he
always
hated
the
effort
of
bringing
out
what
was
in
his
mind
he
stopped
beating
about
the
bush
now
and
said
heavily
you
no
fool
marise
i
do
know
any
of
the
roundabout
ways
to
say
it
to
you
that
a
woman
would
have
but
you
wo
mind
that
what
i
mean
is
i
suppose
i
imagine
that
what
at
the
bottom
of
all
of
it
is
this
are
you
getting
a
chance
to
meet
the
right
sort
of
young
man
the
kind
want
to
marry
for
you
will
be
marrying
before
long
i
suppose
marise
waited
a
long
time
before
she
spoke
so
that
she
would
not
flame
out
as
she
felt
that
would
not
be
speaking
in
her
father
vernacular
and
if
there
was
one
thing
which
every
instinct
of
marise
taught
her
it
was
to
speak
to
every
one
in
his
own
language
nothing
in
the
world
would
have
induced
her
to
expose
her
own
to
other
people
casual
comments
her
own
in
which
she
spoke
to
herself
bitterly
caustically
skeptically
tragically
as
no
one
had
ever
heard
her
speak
aloud
when
she
could
command
herself
to
select
the
right
phrase
out
of
her
vocabulary
she
remarked
pushing
her
tiny
away
with
a
gesture
of
finality
i
do
believe
i
very
much
of
a
marrying
sort
her
father
comment
on
this
was
to
say
stolidly
oh
every
girl
thinks
that
but
if
he
thought
he
could
get
a
rise
out
of
marise
with
this
provocation
he
was
mistaken
she
now
turned
away
from
the
little
table
and
began
with
an
indifferent
air
to
arrange
the
in
the
grate
they
were
sitting
in
the
salon
do
you
like
men
he
asked
presently
she
laughed
a
little
to
dance
with
he
looked
at
her
more
keenly
than
he
had
and
asked
do
you
trust
men
she
turned
this
off
by
riposting
lightly
how
much
is
it
safe
to
trust
anybody
it
was
as
though
a
chance
stroke
had
cut
through
the
dyke
and
let
out
in
a
rush
waters
that
had
lain
sleeping
never
trust
anybody
but
yourself
he
told
her
urgently
the
words
heavy
with
the
intensity
of
his
conviction
a
moment
later
he
added
more
deliberately
his
manner
tinged
with
his
habitual
saturnine
humor
and
it
not
safe
to
trust
yourself
very
far
it
was
at
all
what
he
had
meant
to
say
to
her
but
it
was
such
an
undertaking
to
say
anything
and
what
was
there
to
say
anyhow
he
decided
to
let
it
go
at
that
drank
the
last
of
his
liqueur
fell
back
in
his
armchair
and
reached
for
the
i
hope
you
got
a
good
supply
of
that
chartreuse
he
said
beginning
to
set
up
the
men
it
very
much
better
than
what
we
been
having
not
so
syrupy
i
do
loathe
syrupy
things
after
the
game
was
over
he
took
up
his
paris
herald
and
marise
freed
from
the
necessity
to
make
talk
went
to
the
piano
she
began
to
play
not
chopin
as
she
would
have
liked
but
a
dance
from
the
arlésienne
suite
father
detested
melancholy
music
after
she
had
finished
she
sat
still
sunk
together
on
the
piano
stool
staring
at
the
music
but
not
seeing
it
she
heard
her
father
rustle
his
newspaper
as
if
he
had
lowered
it
to
look
at
her
but
for
once
she
made
no
attempt
to
arouse
herself
she
continued
to
present
to
him
a
silent
dejected
back
he
must
have
considered
this
for
some
minutes
when
he
finally
remarked
i
suppose
there
are
people
who
birthdays
then
with
a
yawn
but
for
me
they
always
make
me
think
of
all
the
ones
i
have
still
to
get
through
with
year
after
year
one
by
one
marise
shoulders
bowed
under
the
weight
of
his
words
and
his
accent
she
still
said
nothing
he
took
up
the
newspaper
again
but
before
he
began
to
read
he
exhorted
her
oh
well
stick
it
out
stick
it
out
molly
as
best
you
can
it
does
last
so
very
long
chapter
xxxix
paris
may
would
you
asked
eugenia
looking
about
her
that
anybody
who
could
get
up
such
a
room
as
this
such
a
perfect
room
would
know
how
to
get
herself
up
better
you
do
suppose
for
a
minute
that
she
does
know
how
to
marise
rejoined
she
added
after
a
moment
to
tease
eugenia
perhaps
she
thinks
it
ordinary
to
be
chic
perhaps
she
thinks
it
is
more
distinguished
to
have
her
very
own
genre
eugenia
said
with
a
nettled
accent
well
would
you
think
if
she
were
going
in
for
a
genre
of
her
own
she
pick
out
one
that
was
a
little
more
ornamental
than
her
provincial
variety
marise
laughed
it
always
gave
her
a
little
malicious
amusement
to
make
eugenia
uneasy
to
make
her
still
more
so
she
added
yet
you
know
well
enough
eugenia
in
any
room
full
of
people
let
mme
vallery
come
in
with
that
mild
sort
of
air
of
hers
and
everybody
else
looks
like
a
dressmaker
mannequin
eugenia
alarmed
for
her
standards
annoyed
and
aroused
disputed
the
point
with
warmth
that
only
because
you
know
who
she
is
if
you
did
you
take
her
for
the
concierge
country
cousin
marise
shook
her
head
exasperatingly
no
you
would
she
has
you
can
see
it
a
mile
away
eugenia
suddenly
conceded
the
point
with
grudging
wonder
how
does
she
it
she
marveled
unreconciled
personality
diagnosed
marise
and
then
seeing
that
eugenia
face
looked
really
clouded
she
stopped
her
teasing
abruptly
ashamed
of
the
unkind
impulse
which
drove
her
to
it
and
of
the
malicious
pleasure
she
took
in
it
what
was
the
inner
irritation
with
everything
that
kept
her
so
aware
of
other
people
weak
points
and
so
easily
led
into
playing
on
them
now
here
and
now
let
her
resolve
she
would
never
tease
eugenia
again
but
she
knew
she
would
she
did
however
resist
an
easy
opening
given
her
by
the
next
remark
of
eugenia
as
she
looked
across
the
beautiful
room
what
it
all
so
just
right
i
going
to
start
in
at
that
corner
and
look
at
every
single
thing
and
find
out
makes
it
right
marise
restrained
the
mocking
words
on
the
tip
of
her
tongue
and
turned
away
to
the
window
near
which
she
stood
across
the
empty
street
in
the
pale
gold
of
the
spring
sunshine
the
vaporous
young
green
of
the
luxembourg
showed
like
a
mist
through
the
tall
iron
palings
the
light
blue
sky
above
was
veiled
with
hazy
white
clouds
stirred
by
a
young
little
spring
breeze
which
blew
languorously
on
the
girl
cheek
it
came
over
her
all
of
it
with
a
soft
rush
the
invitation
to
life
the
lovely
treacherous
invitation
to
live
and
she
drew
back
from
it
with
her
determination
not
to
be
taken
in
by
it
it
was
always
too
horribly
lovely
in
may
it
made
her
ache
it
made
her
want
to
cry
it
made
her
horribly
unhappy
how
detestable
to
have
it
so
lovely
looking
so
seductive
as
though
this
were
only
the
promise
of
something
lovelier
when
there
was
anything
to
redeem
the
promise
when
it
was
all
just
a
part
of
the
general
scheme
to
fool
you
behind
her
eugenia
voice
said
enviously
where
did
she
get
all
these
terribly
quaint
louis
xvi
things
how
thoroughly
eugenia
english
diction
teacher
had
rooted
out
that
turribly
of
eugenia
thought
marise
aloud
she
answered
she
began
collecting
years
ago
before
anybody
else
thought
of
it
i
should
think
a
teacher
would
have
much
money
to
collect
oh
she
picked
them
up
for
nothing
in
corners
of
whatever
province
she
happened
to
be
in
out
of
barns
and
and
attics
eugenia
said
complainingly
it
seems
to
me
she
always
has
been
able
to
pick
up
something
for
nothing
look
at
her
husband
marise
said
over
her
shoulder
oh
she
did
get
much
when
she
got
him
he
never
would
have
been
anything
except
his
good
looks
if
she
had
taken
him
up
and
she
did
get
him
for
nothing
not
much
mlle
hasparren
says
every
one
who
knows
them
says
that
she
made
him
she
writes
his
speeches
now
i
seen
her
and
never
bothers
him
by
being
jealous
i
should
hope
commented
eugenia
she
ages
older
than
he
and
he
such
a
ripping
marise
found
eugenia
fervent
accent
rather
distasteful
not
that
she
minded
her
latest
fad
of
finding
married
men
so
much
more
interesting
subjects
than
the
others
eugenia
affairs
never
lasted
more
than
a
minute
anyhow
but
she
wished
eugenia
would
pick
out
somebody
with
more
brains
than
mme
vallery
husband
somebody
not
so
well
satisfied
with
himself
he
an
awful
imbecile
she
said
what
did
mme
vallery
marry
him
for
if
she
so
terribly
intelligent
challenged
eugenia
she
delighted
in
using
the
words
she
had
formerly
and
giving
them
the
purest
most
colorless
intonation
there
was
not
a
trace
now
in
her
speech
of
the
sweet
thick
unstrained
honey
of
her
original
southern
accent
she
has
brains
for
two
said
marise
shortly
displeased
by
the
direction
of
the
talk
as
a
matter
of
fact
mme
vallery
had
once
informed
her
why
she
had
married
her
handsome
unintelligent
husband
she
had
said
warningly
one
day
when
marise
had
drawn
back
from
a
match
mme
vallery
had
proposed
for
her
do
carry
that
too
far
dear
child
you
will
have
to
give
in
to
the
flesh
sooner
or
later
you
might
as
well
do
it
young
before
the
growth
of
your
intelligence
spoils
your
enjoyment
of
it
as
wait
till
you
driven
to
it
as
i
was
it
not
amusing
in
the
least
to
have
to
take
it
all
mixed
with
the
contempt
of
your
brains
you
find
you
have
to
take
your
share
one
way
or
another
marise
looked
out
frowningly
at
a
great
beech
tree
bursting
into
life
in
the
garden
across
the
street
it
held
its
huge
flowering
crest
proudly
into
the
spring
air
to
look
at
it
was
like
hearing
a
flourish
of
trumpets
triumphal
exulting
that
was
all
very
well
for
trees
thought
marise
that
stupid
yearly
emergence
into
a
life
that
promised
so
much
and
brought
futility
along
the
inside
the
luxembourg
under
the
hedge
of
lilacs
under
the
new
splendor
of
the
great
beech
a
young
man
and
a
girl
in
a
pale
gray
dress
were
strolling
they
looked
at
each
other
and
smiled
that
the
way
my
father
and
mother
probably
walked
together
thought
marise
wincing
that
was
one
of
the
clumsiest
most
obvious
parts
of
the
general
conspiracy
to
fool
you
but
when
you
had
the
key
to
the
code
as
marise
had
there
was
little
danger
that
you
would
be
taken
in
i
think
i
hear
them
coming
said
eugenia
i
do
hope
monsieur
is
with
her
not
that
he
ever
condescends
to
pay
the
slightest
attention
to
me
she
assumed
carefully
a
pose
of
unconscious
ease
on
her
small
chair
marise
turned
around
from
the
window
and
looked
at
her
with
appreciation
was
it
only
two
years
ago
that
eugenia
had
scrambled
up
from
the
crumpled
bed
on
which
she
had
lain
nobody
can
say
genre
is
not
decorative
eugenia
she
remarked
with
the
sincere
intention
of
pleasing
the
other
girl
that
a
perfectly
glorious
toilette
just
right
and
oh
how
divinely
that
broadcloth
is
tailored
eugenia
looked
at
her
resentfully
with
a
flash
of
her
old
suspicion
that
she
was
not
being
treated
as
an
equal
i
have
any
and
you
know
it
she
said
if
mme
vallery
can
have
do
you
suppose
i
going
to
be
satisfied
with
just
chic
marise
felt
one
of
her
claps
of
laughter
rising
within
her
but
kept
it
back
as
the
beautifully
proportioned
paneled
door
opened
to
admit
their
hostess
a
tall
spare
stooped
woman
dressed
plainly
in
fine
black
with
a
shrewd
wrinkled
face
and
guiltless
of
the
smallest
trace
of
powder
she
looked
like
an
elderly
jesuit
one
who
wields
a
great
deal
more
power
than
he
likes
to
show
my
children
she
greeted
the
girls
in
a
clear
voice
with
the
utmost
simplicity
and
directness
of
intonation
have
we
kept
you
waiting
long
i
told
auguste
that
we
were
a
little
late
auguste
magnificently
tall
and
magnificently
bearded
having
now
followed
her
in
the
four
sacramental
were
accomplished
eugenia
this
time
the
promptest
of
all
after
the
equally
sacramental
exchange
of
salutations
and
questions
and
answers
had
been
achieved
questions
as
to
health
and
general
news
which
did
not
in
the
least
denote
any
interest
in
these
matters
answers
which
were
pronounced
with
perfunctory
indifference
and
received
in
the
same
way
the
necessary
civilized
preliminaries
were
considered
disposed
of
and
the
first
moves
of
the
game
could
be
taken
vallery
gambit
was
to
say
looking
admiringly
at
eugenia
such
a
piece
of
the
month
of
may
ought
to
be
within
four
walls
come
over
to
the
balcony
a
moment
and
let
me
show
you
your
sister

luxembourg
in
flower
mme
vallery
move
was
to
sit
in
the
winged
brocaded
and
motion
marise
to
sit
beside
her
let
get
our
business
done
and
off
our
hands
first
of
all
she
said
smiling
up
at
the
tall
girl
in
an
admiration
as
frank
as
her
for
eugenia
and
for
marise
vastly
more
valuable
the
others
in
a
little
chiming
burst
of
chatter
and
high
spirits
moved
off
towards
the
balcony
mme
vallery
glanced
after
them
with
an
inscrutable
expression
and
then
at
marise
with
a
brisk
manner
the
matter
at
issue
just
then
the
occasion
of
the
girls
call
was
a
fête
de
charité
at
the
lycée
over
which
mme
vallery
sister
was
directrice
shoved
up
to
that
position
so
the
lycée
teachers
said
by
the
political
pull
of
madame
vallery
herself
but
even
they
could
not
deny
that
the
connection
was
highly
advantageous
for
the
lycée
there
was
not
another
one
in
paris
which
felt
itself
more
protégé
in
high
places
more
sure
of
its
standing
with
the
ministry
of
education
and
its
annual
charity
fête
from
being
the
usual
bazar
with
aprons
and
on
sale
and
perhaps
an
inexpensive
conjuror
pulling
rabbits
out
of
silk
hats
in
the
to
amuse
the
children
had
become
one
of
the
most
elaborate
and
unique
annual
events
of
the
city
a
good
part
of
lent
its
highly
ornamental
presence
to
these
affairs
and
helpless
before
mme
vallery
energy
and
acumen
always
left
much
more
of
the
contents
of
its
purse
than
it
had
the
slightest
intention
of
leaving
in
the
amusingly
decorated
stalls
where
pretty
amateur
salesgirls
sold
the
goods
furnished
at
cost
under
pressure
from
mme
vallery
by
the
most
fashionable
shops
in
paris
this
year
marise
had
been
asked
to
play
along
with
two
other
de
la
cueva
pupils
in
the
afternoon
concert
which
was
the
of
the
three
days
fête
mme
vallery
had
written
her
to
ask
her
to
come
to
talk
over
the
choice
of
music
and
to
eugenia
surprise
and
extreme
pleasure
had
mentioned
casually
that
she
would
be
glad
to
see
her
pretty
friend
miss
mills
also
marise
had
instantly
wondered
what
she
wanted
to
get
out
of
eugenia
and
now
behind
her
fresh
open
unlined
young
face
she
was
hiding
a
determination
to
find
out
what
and
to
keep
eugenia
from
being
unduly
exploited
she
might
tease
eugenia
herself
but
she
had
an
feeling
of
protective
care
towards
her
eugenia
was
so
awfully
defenseless
in
spite
of
her
money
and
so
naïve
still
in
spite
of
the
sophisticated
lore
and
manners
which
she
had
so
energetically
acquired
she
had
not
learned
that
suspicion
of
everything
which
is
the
only
valid
protection
against
life
but
mme
vallery
said
nothing
whatever
about
eugenia
other
than
to
comment
in
passing
on
how
excessively
pretty
she
was
a
real
type
such
as
one
seldom
sees
nowadays
marise
found
herself
as
usual
quite
helpless
before
the
vatican
antechamber
suavity
of
the
older
woman
and
reflected
not
without
some
resentment
that
she
probably
seemed
as
naïve
to
mme
vallery
as
eugenia
did
to
her
after
some
desultory
talk
about
other
features
of
the
fête
they
got
out
a
pile
of
music
went
together
to
the
piano
where
marise
tried
the
effects
of
various
combinations
and
finally
decided
on
a
desirable
one
all
this
time
vallery
and
eugenia
spent
on
the
balcony
leaning
over
the
railing
the
sound
of
their
voices
and
occasional
laughter
coming
in
pleasantly
through
the
open
windows
they
came
in
together
when
mme
vallery
summoned
them
to
share
the
muscat
and
hard
sweet
biscuits
which
it
was
part
of
her
genre
to
serve
at
four
instead
of
the
newly
introduced
tea
business
is
over
she
announced
settling
herself
in
the
chair
back
of
the
little
stand
where
the
tray
stood
now
for
some
talk
she
put
her
hand
to
the
crystal
carafe
and
held
it
there
for
a
moment
another
of
the
ecclesiastical
details
of
her
appearance
was
the
beauty
of
her
hands
white
and
shapely
vallery
seated
the
girls
and
then
himself
smiling
into
his
beautiful
glistening
brown
beard
eugenia
too
was
smiling
with
a
dazzled
look
of
pleasure
mme
vallery
looked
down
at
the
wine
she
was
pouring
marise
suppressed
a
qualm
of
distaste
for
vallery
and
started
the
talk
by
laughing
outright
as
at
a
sudden
recollection
of
something
comic
she
explained
that
she
had
just
had
a
letter
from
america
from
an
old
cousin
of
her
father
who
always
kept
her
au
courant
of
the
quaint
and
humorous
of
the
her
letters
are
as
good
as
a
comic
paper
said
marise
sipping
her
wine
translatable
asked
vallery
most
of
the
comic
things
that
happen
in
the
french
are
but
they
very
funny
for
all
of
that
he
laughed
reminiscently
and
stroked
his
beard
memories
of
jeanne
and
isabelle
and
what
they
considered
comic
stories
rose
blackly
to
marise
mind
she
turned
a
gay
laughing
face
to
vallery
and
translated
for
his
benefit
aunt
hetty
latest
story
about
what
happened
when
a
skunk
got
into
the
and
she
and
agnes
went
to
the
rescue
at
midnight
in
their
and
it
was
as
much
to
drown
out
what
was
going
on
inside
her
own
mind
as
to
amuse
the
others
that
she
did
her
liveliest
best
by
the
story
telling
it
with
the
gusto
and
brio
which
made
her
a
favorite
with
people
who
liked
youthful
high
spirits
it
was
broad
farce
nothing
else
and
she
did
not
draw
back
from
the
farcical
color
it
needed
to
carry
it
off
it
was
a
story
she
told
herself
that
either
made
people
laugh
or
it
was
a
failure
her
audience
was
certainly
laughing
when
she
finished
the
account
of
the
homeric
laughing
and
wiping
their
eyes
that
reminds
me
said
vallery
his
eyes
glistening
with
mirth
of
a
story
about
a
dog
that
my
uncle
used
to
have
you
not
going
to
tell
that
story
here
announced
his
wife
with
the
calm
accent
of
mastery
which
once
in
a
while
slipped
from
her
in
an
unguarded
moment
he
went
through
the
form
of
protesting
claiming
that
it
was
nothing
nowadays
people
were
not
prudish
but
his
wife
settled
the
matter
by
taking
the
floor
herself
turning
to
the
girls
and
saying
laughingly
that
uncle
of
my
husband
he
was
one
of
the
old
school
out
of
a
balzac
novel
of
the
provinces
there
are
any
more
like
him
it
was
through
a
quarrel
with
him
that
auguste
and
i
met
each
other
this
slid
her
easily
along
into
talk
of
early
days
a
quarter
of
a
century
before
when
she
was
in
one
of
the
first
lycées
at
the
time
when
teachers
were
an
abomination
and
a
hissing
to
the
decent
bourgeois
dryly
with
the
inimitable
terse
picturesqueness
of
phrase
which
made
her
famous
as
a
talker
with
people
who
demanded
a
great
deal
more
than
youthful
high
spirits
she
took
them
back
with
her
twenty
years
into
the
remote
provincial
city
where
she
had
encountered
every
narrowness
possible
to
bigotry
and
reaction
and
had
wound
it
all
around
her
little
finger
through
her
highly
amusing
recital
of
how
she
had
played
on
the
prejudices
of
those
provincials
how
adroitly
she
had
employed
against
them
their
very
vices
their
jealousy
and
suspicion
of
each
other
their
grasping
avarice
their
utter
ignorance
of
what
modern
education
meant
through
all
this
played
like
a
little
sulphurous
flame
her
acrid
scorn
and
contempt
for
them
her
vitriolic
satisfaction
in
having
cheated
and
beaten
them
in
having
turned
them
inside
out
and
made
fools
of
them
without
their
ever
once
suspecting
it
her
admiration
of
her
powers
was
boundless
that
is
now
one
of
the
most
prosperous
and
successful
lycées
in
eastern
france
he
told
the
girls
and
every
year
they
have
a
big
dinner
with
my
wife
as
guest
of
honor
with
speeches
and
things
and
somebody
lays
a
wreath
on
her
as
though
she
were
a
statue
quite
a
joke
hein
well
that
must
be
an
enjoyable
occasion
indeed
thought
marise
seeing
the
scene
as
though
she
had
been
there
the
provincials
trying
to
honor
the
founder
of
their
lycée
mme
vallery
sitting
at
the
right
hand
of
their
mayor
with
her
mild
air
of
deprecating
the
honor
done
her
and
her
little
sulphurous
flame
of
vitriolic
contempt
playing
over
the
convolutions
of
her
brain
yes
it
is
a
very
pretty
world
we
live
in
thought
marise
laughing
heartily
at
mme
vallery
satirical
imitation
of
one
of
the
clumsy
speeches
made
in
her
honor
on
the
last
occasion
she
thought
it
still
a
prettier
world
when
in
the
cab
as
she
was
accompanying
eugenia
back
to
auteuil
eugenia
said
radiating
satisfaction
i
to
have
my
part
in
the
too
you
said
marise
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
going
to
give
the
money
to
pay
for
the
appearance
of
a
russian
dancer
the
very
newest
thing
it
will
be
the
of
the
entire
fête
and
my
name
is
going
on
the
program
eh
bien
cried
marise
in
the
liveliest
surprise
why
i
did
hear
a
word
about
all
this
no
it
was
in
talking
with
vallery
that
the
plan
was
made
he
dreamed
of
their
being
able
to
afford
such
a
thing
it
was
my
own
idea
he
was
quite
carried
away
by
it
could
see
how
i
came
to
think
of
it
marise
was
silent
meditating
profoundly
on
the
prettiness
of
the
world
in
which
we
are
called
upon
to
live
the
more
she
meditated
the
hotter
grew
her
resentment
it
was
all
very
well
to
be
cynical
and
it
was
foolish
and
raw
to
be
surprised
at
cynicism
but
this
was
a
little
really
a
excessive
she
flushed
angrily
as
she
went
over
in
her
mind
the
oiled
exactitude
with
which
each
cog
had
slipped
into
the
next
the
casual
invitation
to
eugenia
vallery
admiration
of
her
beauty
the
talk
on
the
balcony
oh
poor
eugenia
what
a
fool
she
must
have
seemed
with
her
naïve
impression
that
it
was
her
own
idea
and
how
that
fatuous
barber
model
must
have
laughed
with
his
wife
after
they
had
left
the
shameless
with
which
they
had
turned
the
talk
to
something
and
kept
it
there
and
she
flinched
her
vanity
cut
to
the
quick
her
own
naïve
blindness
to
the
little
game
they
were
putting
up
on
her
well
she
would
know
better
next
time
she
had
unpeeled
one
more
layer
from
this
pretty
pretty
world
of
ours
speaking
on
impulse
she
now
said
rather
abruptly
to
eugenia
i
would
have
much
to
do
with
the
vallerys
if
i
were
you
he
really
an
awful
cad
eugenia
looked
at
her
with
a
knowing
smile
you
jealous
she
said
laughing
he
did
take
off
to
show
you
the
luxembourg
in
spring
marise
was
for
an
instant
stricken
so
speechless
by
this
idea
that
she
could
only
stare
and
by
the
time
she
could
have
spoken
she
perceived
that
there
was
nothing
to
say
no
comment
on
the
prettiness
of
the
world
and
the
people
who
live
in
it
that
began
to
be
adequate
at
the
great
gates
of
the
eugenia
and
her
maid
descended
eugenia
kissed
marise
the
correct
kiss
on
each
cheek
this
time
nothing
annoyed
eugenia
more
than
any
reference
intended
or
imaginary
to
the
time
when
she
had
gone
about
kissing
her
on
the
mouth
after
the
other
two
had
rung
the
clanging
bell
and
been
admitted
marise
stood
for
a
moment
hesitating
then
she
decided
to
walk
home
although
home
was
a
long
long
way
from
auteuil
it
would
do
her
good
she
thought
setting
out
at
the
powerful
swinging
gait
she
had
for
the
long
walks
which
for
her
as
for
the
more
energetic
of
her
classmates
had
been
the
only
form
of
outdoor
sport
accessible
she
had
decided
to
walk
so
that
she
could
cool
off
and
think
over
the
vallerys
manoeuver
and
as
she
walked
she
had
it
out
with
herself
going
deep
by
the
end
of
the
first
mile
she
knew
it
was
foolish
and
futile
to
resent
the
afternoon
comedy
that
was
the
sort
of
thing
everybody
tried
to
do
only
few
people
were
as
successful
as
mme
vallery
she
knew
well
enough
what
she
would
get
if
she
pelted
right
in
on
them
now
as
they
sat
laughing
over
their
little
triumph
they
would
never
dream
of
denying
it
any
more
than
she
or
her
father
would
deny
being
the
author
of
a
plan
in
chess
which
led
to
an
defeat
it
was
all
a
part
of
the
game
and
she
might
as
well
make
up
her
mind
to
it
and
renew
her
determination
to
keep
out
of
the
game
as
far
as
she
personally
was
concerned
they
were
no
worse
than
other
people
only
more
intelligent
and
more
interesting
she
could
tell
to
the
very
turn
of
the
phrase
what
mme
vallery
would
say
to
her
if
she
should
have
the
crassness
to
go
in
and
make
a
scene
my
dear
child
no
power
on
earth
can
protect
naïveté
it
is
a
lamb
whose
wool
belongs
to
the
best
shearer
let
her
sharpen
her
wits
your
young
friend
she
need
to
sooner
or
later
it
ought
to
have
been
the
best
of
practice
for
her
a
little
skirmish
like
the
one
we
just
furnished
her
she
would
do
well
to
practise
before
she
gets
into
a
serious
skirmish
with
somebody
who
wants
something
out
of
her
what
is
this
for
to
please
me
not
at
all
to
make
some
money
for
poor
people
mothers
and
anæmic
babies
show
me
another
woman
in
our
circle
who
puts
herself
out
as
much
as
i
do
for
the
poor
your
pretty
friend
has
more
money
than
is
good
for
her
i
only
securing
a
little
of
it
for
the
needy
that
was
true
too
thought
marise
mme
vallery
really
did
a
lot
of
good
and
very
unostentatiously
if
people
were
only
far
enough
beneath
her
in
intelligence
and
social
position
and
money
she
would
do
anything
for
them
very
simply
in
the
nicest
sort
of
way
and
if
she
took
a
rather
horrid
delight
in
making
fools
of
people
more
pretentious
what
had
marise
to
reproach
her
with
she
who
could
not
refrain
from
malicious
teasing
it
was
part
of
the
same
thing
everything
was
part
of
the
same
thing
and
the
same
thing
always
turned
out
to
be
very
much
the
same
also
mme
vallery
had
really
always
been
very
kind
to
marise
seemed
really
fond
of
her
had
given
her
innumerable
opportunities
which
otherwise
she
would
never
what
does
she
want
to
get
out
of
marise
suddenly
asked
herself
struck
by
a
sudden
suspicion
and
wondering
why
she
had
never
thought
of
this
before
pondering
this
unpeeling
another
layer
an
acrid
odor
in
her
nostrils
she
struck
out
into
a
longer
swifter
gait
at
her
old
futile
trick
of
trying
to
hurry
away
from
what
was
inside
her
heart
the
tall
slim
lithe
girl
walking
swiftly
through
the
sweet
spring
twilight
looked
like
the
personification
of
with
her
fresh
young
face
her
dewy
dark
eyes
her
sensitive
mobile
young
mouth
red
as
a
dark
red
rose
she
looked
like
youth
itself
welcoming
in
the
new
season
several
people
glanced
after
her
and
smiled
with
sympathy
for
her
freshness
and
bloom
and
untouched
virginal
candor
chapter

paris
may
eugenia
had
been
complaining
that
her
new
teacher
in
advanced
french
diction
was
very
and
exacting
and
had
asked
marise
to
go
with
her
to
a
lesson
to
back
her
up
in
a
protest
against
his
unreasonable
demands
the
two
girls
drove
up
to
the
français
in
eugenia
inevitable
cab
and
leaving
her
inevitable
maid
to
wait
in
it
passed
through
the
dingy
little
into
an
corridor
and
felt
their
way
toilsomely
up
a
stairway
not
lighted
at
all
a
dingy
corridor
with
painted
and
numbered
doors
on
each
side
like
a
needy
home
or
reformatory
a
knock
at
one
of
these
opened
by
a
bald
pale
elderly
man
with
a
knobby
nose
and
several
chins
a
tiny
cluttered
stuffy
room
with
a
lumpy
sofa
two
chairs
an
easel
and
a
window
after
her
presentation
to
vaudoyer
marise
sat
down
on
one
of
the
hard
chairs
to
await
developments
the
actor
was
in
a
long
blouse
and
excused
himself
by
saying
that
his
pupil
was
a
little
ahead
of
time
a
real
american
he
said
smiling
at
both
of
them
he
had
been
painting
he
explained

a
wrinkled
old

towards
a
canvas
on
an
easel
oh
you
are
twice
an
artist
remarked
marise
doing
as
she
had
been
taught
to
do
automatically
turning
a
pretty
speech
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
thought
the
sketch
anything
but
artistic
the
old
man
face
clouded
to
be
a
painter
that
was
all
i
ever
wanted
he
said
looking
with
affection
at
the
very
mediocre
landscape
and
adding
sadly
all
my
life
all
my
life
but
to
have
been
to
be
such
an
artist
as
you
are
on
the
stage
surely
that
ought
to
be
enough
said
marise
this
time
she
spoke
sincerely
out
of
a
very
genuine
admiration
for
his
acting
one
does
what
one
can
what
one
can
said
the
old
man
resignedly
unbuttoning
his
blouse
and
dragging
it
off
revealing
snuffy
and
crumpled
black
garments
he
looked
thought
marise
like
the
parish
priest
of
a
very
poor
and
neglected
parish
and
he
had
been
for
years
why
for
a
one
of
the
most
solidly
esteemed
and
admired
actors
in
the
finest
theatrical
company
in
the
world
what
more
does
any
man
want
marise
asked
herself
wondering
why
his
face
in
repose
was
so
bitter
and
melancholy
before
beginning
his
lesson
he
gave
a
last
look
at
his
painting
what
do
you
think
of
it
what
do
you
think
of
it
he
asked
suddenly
turning
on
marise
the
question
like
a
loaded
revolver
at
her
temple
much
practice
had
steadied
marise
nerves
against
any
sort
of
that
could
be
practised
in
social
relations
she
said
instantly
i
think
it
shows
one
of
the
most
charming
landscapes
i
ever
saw
where
in
the
world
is
there
such
a
delightful
composition
she
was
dealing
with
some
one
infinitely
more
practised
than
she
who
was
not
in
the
least
taken
in
by
her
evasion
sighing
he
turned
the
canvas
with
its
face
to
the
easel
and
told
her
over
his
shoulder
in
my
own
country
where
i
ought
to
have
stayed
and
been
a
and
happy
nowhere
you
ever
heard
of
a
far
corner
of
the
pyrenees
is
the
name
and
as
if
in
spite
of
himself
to
pronounce
the
name
moved
him
he
broke
out
it
the
most
beautiful
place
a
little
heaven
on
earth
why
should
any
one
leave
it
to
spend
his
life
in
this
boulevard
hell
of
malignity
such
noble
lines
in
its
mountains
such
grand
pacifying
harmony
in
the
valleys
enough
to
reconcile
a
man
to
being
alive
such
details
as
it
has
too
there
is
a
gorge
there
where
the
gavarnie
rushes
down
always
on
the
hottest
dustiest
most
blinding
summer
day
it
is
cool
there
the
air
green
like
chartres
and
alive
with
the
thunder
of
the
water
he
frowned
shook
his
head
put
his
hand
to
a
book
on
the
table
and
said
dismissing
his
evocation
with
a
shrug
eh
bien
eh
bien
the
lesson
began
but
marise
heard
not
a
word
of
it
not
a
word
she
sat
straight
on
the
hard
chair
her
face
a
blank
and
walked
up
the
street
with
jeanne
seeing
in
the
blue
twilight
the
pale
face
of
garnier
approaching
them
the
alcove
curtains
hung
close
before
her
and
jeanne
voice
was
on
the
other
side
and
then
the
burst
of
laughter
from
across
the
landing
cut
short
by
jeanne
closing
the
door
and
then
the
heavy
dragging
step
in
the
corridor
the
loud
harsh
breathing
she
waited
tense
with
fright
to
see
the
curtains
twitch
open
and
jeanne
dreadful
face
appear
some
one
was
speaking
to
her
urgently
insistently
by
name
marise
marise
it
was
eugenia
speaking
to
her
help
me
explain
to
vaudoyer
that
i
have
the
least
desire
to
become
an
actress
or
to
know
every
word
of
molière
by
heart
that
i
simply
want
lessons
in
how
to
pronounce
french
correctly
the
kind
of
lessons
my
teacher
gives
me
she
spoke
with
an
impatient
accent
and
marise
coming
to
herself
saw
the
two
facing
each
other
with
angry
looks
vaudoyer
said
indignantly
it
not
worth
my
while
to
give
instruction
to
a
student
who
will
not
do
the
necessary
work
i
will
do
any
work
eugenia
answered
hotly
but
what
has
reading
a
lot
of
deadly
dull
old
books
to
do
with
pronouncing
french
correctly
and
if
i
not
going
to
be
an
actress
or
a
singer
what
the
use
of
all
those
idiotic
ah
ah
oh
oh
fee
fee
exercises
vaudoyer
sat
down
abruptly
and
reaching
for
a
large
checked
handkerchief
mopped
his
bald
head
and
perspiring
face
with
it
he
was
evidently
containing
himself
with
difficulty
and
waiting
till
he
could
be
sure
of
speaking
with
moderation
before
he
opened
his
lips
eugenia
explained
to
marise
with
dignity
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
state
her
case
i
come
to
vaudoyer
for
lessons
in
diction
i
come
to
study
singing
or
history
i
hate
history
and
all
those
dull
studies
i
do
see
why
everybody
should
always
be
trying
to
force
me
into
them
vaudoyer
gets
very
angry
because
i
will
not
practise
singing
lessons
and
because
i
can
not
find
the
time
to
spend
hours
in
the
bibliothèque
nationale
reading
all
about
everything
that
happened
in
molière
time
what
do
i
care
what
happened
in
time
what
i
want
what
i
am
paying
for
is
a
very
simple
thing
instruction
in
french
diction
i
do
see
that
i
am
getting
it
her
accent
showed
that
she
considered
her
case
unassailably
good
and
reasonable
vaudoyer
listened
with
attention
looking
at
her
very
hard
and
when
she
had
finished
he
nodded
you
are
right
miss
mills
i
am
not
the
teacher
for
you
i
am
a
poor
old
impractical
frenchman
incapable
of
satisfying
a
practical
american
girl
who
knows
what
she
wants
and
has
the
money
to
buy
it
you
are
the
race
of
the
future
you
americans
i
of
the
past
there
is
no
common
ground
between
us
he
spoke
mildly
eugenia
stared
marise
winced
what
do
you
mean
m
vaudoyer
asked
eugenia
are
you
sending
me
away
he
said
with
a
little
smile
you
have
sent
me
away
miss
mills
far
away
and
as
to
what
i
mean
if
you
like
i
will
try
to
tell
you
but
you
will
not
understand
i
can
not
talk
the
american
language
i
can
only
speak
the
french
language
he
paused
wiping
his
perspiring
forehead
again
with
his
checked
handkerchief
there
are
two
parts
to
every
art
one
is
the
thorough
command
of
your
medium
the
other
is
the
personality
you
express
through
your
medium
neither
has
the
slightest
value
without
the
other
neither
is
to
be
had
without
paying
the
price
of
all
you
have
all
you
must
have
perfect
command
of
your
medium
just
in
itself
as
a
tool
listen
he
stood
up
his
heavily
jowled
face
grim
and
stern
drew
a
long
breath
as
if
he
were
about
to
speak
and
then
as
at
a
sudden
thought
paused
the
expression
of
his
face
changing
with
comical
suddenness
to
a
broad
smile
and
began
to
laugh
the
girls
stared
at
him
in
amazement
wondering
if
he
had
taken
leave
of
his
senses
apparently
something
very
funny
had
popped
into
his
mind
just
as
he
was
about
to
go
on
with
his
statement
to
them
it
must
have
been
really
funny
indeed
for
he
could
not
stop
his
laughter
try
as
he
might
it
was
too
much
for
him
both
hands
on
his
hips
throwing
back
his
head
he
pealed
out
an
irresistible
ha
ha
as
though
he
would
burst
if
he
did
not
laugh
seeing
their
astonished
faces
he
tried
to
stop
to
tell
them
the
joke
choked
himself
down
to
rich
chuckles
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
and
the
joke
striking
him
afresh
went
off
again
in
a
huge
roar
of
mirth
that
made
them
both
smile
and
then
laugh
outright
in
sympathy
at
this
his
face
instantly
resumed
its
sad
stern
expression
and
he
was
looking
at
them
severely
as
before
breathing
quickly
it
is
true
as
though
he
had
been
running
but
without
a
trace
of
any
feeling
there
you
see
he
said
drily
that
is
an
example
of
what
i
mean
by
command
of
a
medium
to
be
master
of
tool
i
must
not
only
be
able
to
laugh
when
i
feel
like
it
but
whenever
i
need
to
laugh
whether
i
feel
like
it
or
not
and
i
assure
you
young
ladies
i
do
not
feel
in
the
least
like
laughing
now
having
had
this
glimpse
of
the
future
as
it
will
be
shaped
to
the
american
mold
by
the
people
of
the
future
the
girls
were
stricken
silent
by
all
this
their
lips
frozen
in
astonishment
still
curving
in
the
set
smile
that
was
all
that
was
left
of
their
foolish
induced
mirth
marise
was
nettled
and
angry
he
had
no
business
playing
tricks
like
that
on
them
she
had
been
made
to
appear
foolish
horribly
foolish
and
she
resented
it
well
miss
mills
he
went
on
addressing
eugenia
you
can
not
get
such
a
control
of
your
medium
you
can
not
learn
to
speak
any
language
beautifully
without
long
long
dull
hours
of
the
oh
oh
ah
ah
practice
that
you
scorn
you
can
not
buy
such
a
command
of
your
medium
not
for
millions
of
your
great
round
dollars
no
not
the
wealthiest
sharpest
american
who
ever
lived
can
possess
european
culture
by
buying
little
pieces
of
it
here
and
there
and
hanging
it
up
on
his
wall
by
changing
the
very
fibre
of
your
being
that
is
the
only
way
to
become
anything
that
is
worth
becoming
and
you
can
not
change
the
fibre
of
your
being
without
dying
a
thousand
deaths
and
knowing
a
thousand
births
he
puffed
out
a
scornful
breath
and
went
on
and
for
the
other
half
miss
mills
you
want
to
learn
diction
by
reading
to
me
but
what
you
read
has
sense
it
is
not
just
consonants
and
vowels
and
to
read
it
well
you
must
understand
it
and
to
understand
it
you
must
know
something
do
you
understand
me
you
must
something
i
soon
found
that
you
could
not
understand
molière
because
you
know
no
history
no
literature
nor
anything
else
you
should
have
been
learning
you
can
not
read
with
any
in
your
voice
unless
you
understand
the
of
what
you
are
reading
you
can
not
read
molière
or
anybody
else
as
if
you
were
reading
celarent
darii
ferio
or
at
least
his
carefully
repressed
indignation
burst
for
a
moment
from
his
control
he
said
in
a
roar
at
least
you
can
not
in
loge
not
not
even
an
american
not
even
a
representative
of
the
people
of
the
future
he
had
risen
to
his
feet
trembling
with
his
anger
a
rebuking
a
blasphemy
the
girls
shrank
back
startled
at
once
he
extinguished
the
flame
went
for
a
moment
to
the
window
and
when
he
turned
back
said
quietly
you
must
excuse
an
old
man
bad
temper
miss
mills
and
you
must
look
for
a
politer
more
practical
teacher
i
can
give
you
the
address
of
one
who
will
suit
you
i
can
in
fact
he
said
smoothly
give
you
the
addresses
of
several
hundred
who
will
suit
you
perfectly
i
will
send
the
addresses
of
several
to
you
miss
mills
miss
he
was
vague
as
to
name
but
murmured
something
with
an
absent
courtesy
he
stepped
to
the
door
opened
it
with
an
urbane
inclination
of
the
head
eugenia
held
in
her
hand
the
sealed
envelope
which
contained
the
usual
fee
for
a
lesson
and
now
looked
down
at
it
uncertain
whether
she
dared
offer
it
he
saw
her
glance
at
it
and
relieved
her
of
her
uncertainty
no
no
fee
miss
mills
i
have
given
you
no
lesson
as
they
passed
before
him
he
added
under
his
breath
no
lesson
that
is
that
will
be
of
any
value
to
you
marise
glancing
over
her
shoulder
saw
him
turn
at
once
to
the
easel
and
reach
for
his
palette
and
brushes
he
had
dropped
them
from
his
mind
it
was
the
airy
finishing
touch
to
their
humiliation
she
burned
with
anger
and
shame
they
groped
their
way
down
the
darkened
stairs
in
silence
neither
trusting
herself
to
speak
lest
she
burst
into
tears
at
the
bottom
marise
said
neutrally
i
have
a
music
lesson
now
would
you
like
to
come
along
eugenia
said
in
a
loud
quavering
voice
i
should
think
not
i
have
had
enough
of
their
hatefulness
for
day
she
went
on
her
voice
shaken
by
suppressed
sobs
which
did
not
at
all
fit
what
she
was
saying
and
i
an
appointment
the
hairdresser
anyhow
she
fumbled
with
a
desperate
haste
in
her
little
jerked
out
a
lacy
handkerchief
and
wiped
her
eyes
angrily
but
more
tears
came
a
flood
of
nervous
excited
tears
which
ran
down
in
big
drops
she
flung
her
arms
around
marise
neck
and
hiding
her
face
on
her
shoulder
cried
out
pitifully
oh
marise
do
you
ever
just
want
to
go
back
marise
heart
was
very
full
of
compassion
very
barren
of
consolation
i
have
any
home
to
go
back
to
any
more
than
you
she
said
in
a
whisper
eugenia
reached
up
pulled
her
head
down
and
kissed
her
still
sobbing
marise
kept
her
cheek
pressed
against
the
other
face
aching
with
her
helplessness
burning
to
find
some
word
of
comfort
finding
nothing
but
loving
silence
to
express
her
tenderness
and
pity
a
door
opened
upstairs
laughing
voices
sounded
on
the
landing
above
the
two
girls
drew
apart
and
moved
towards
the
door
hand
in
hand
ii
mme
de
la
cueva
had
been
crying
and
marise
guessed
that
she
was
getting
ready
to
have
a
new
husband
she
seemed
to
have
had
bad
luck
in
husbands
the
one
who
had
just
been
put
to
the
door
was
the
second
marise
had
known
in
the
four
years
of
her
study
with
the
pianist
and
there
had
been
at
least
two
before
that
it
was
a
terrible
grief
to
her
always
to
find
out
that
she
no
longer
cared
for
the
one
she
had
but
she
faced
the
facts
with
courage
allowing
herself
no
dissembling
no
bourgeoise
timidity
the
old
one
disappeared
and
in
a
few
months
a
new
one
was
there
my
child
said
the
pianist
affectionately
pulling
marise
down
to
kiss
her
on
both
cheeks
no
lesson
nor
she
spoke
solemnly
the
tears
in
her
eyes
she
began
to
cry
openly
marise
sat
down
by
her
startled
out
of
her
own
mood
of
resentment
why
dear
madame
de
la
cueva
why
she
asked
what
has
happened
i
am
going
to
america
said
the
older
woman
georges
noel
and
i
are
booked
for
a
concert
tour
of
the
world
we
will
be
married
in
australia
the
inevitable
first
thought
of
the
magnificent
egotism
of
youth
was
for
itself
why
what
shall
do
cried
marise
aggrieved
mme
de
la
cueva
did
not
resent
this
she
never
resented
anything
which
she
recognized
as
natural
and
this
seemed
to
her
natural
and
proper
she
took
marise
hand
in
hers
tenderly
maternally
it
is
for
your
good
my
dear
child
the
change
though
i
know
how
you
will
miss
me
you
need
some
one
else
a
year
with
the
old
visconti
will
be
the
making
of
you
the
old
visconti
cried
marise
but
he
lives
in
rome
but
it
is
perfectly
possible
for
other
people
to
live
in
rome
too
my
dear
child
a
year
in
rome
at
your
age
it
will
be
the
making
of
you
you
will
always
bless
your
poor
old
de
la
cueva
who
secured
it
for
you
youth
talent
beauty
rome
she
drew
the
picture
with
envious
admiration
of
its
possibilities
there
was
no
use
trying
to
reason
with
her
as
one
would
with
any
one
else
marise
knew
that
from
experience
no
use
trying
to
show
the
material
practical
obstacles
in
the
way
what
would
her
father
say
how
could
she
go
alone
to
rome
to
live
not
that
mme
de
la
cueva
would
have
hesitated
at
any
age
to
go
anywhere
alone
to
live
but
she
would
not
long
have
remained
alone
how
like
mme
de
la
cueva
to
dispose
of
her
so
calmly
even
as
marise
said
all
this
to
herself
she
was
aware
by
a
sudden
warm
gush
of
pleasure
and
excitement
in
her
heart
that
she
was
delighted
beyond
measure
with
the
plan
that
she
had
been
longing
for
some
change
in
her
life
that
she
had
been
growing
deathly
stale
in
the
same
old
round
the
absurdly
consultations
with
biron
in
the
kitchen
the
same
old
professors
at
the
sorbonne
with
the
same
old
glass
of
and
the
same
nasal
delivery
of
the
same
old
lectures
even
mme
de
la
cueva
with
her
same
old
clichés
about
mass
and
bulk
in
the
bass
she
felt
no
guilt
about
this
last
for
if
there
were
one
person
in
the
world
who
understood
entirely
the
fatigue
at
the
recurrence
of
the
same
old
things
it
was
mme
de
la
cueva
the
pianist
looking
at
her
young
disciple
with
discerning
and
experienced
eyes
saw
something
of
this
and
smiled
sympathetically
you
have
been
working
working
working
and
now
it
is
time
to
run
a
little
free
my
marisette
she
said
patting
her
hand
you
are
how
old
said
marise
exactly
as
though
fate
had
timed
it
very
likely
fate
did
she
had
a
great
faith
in
fate
provided
one
did
not
hang
back
before
the
doors
fate
set
open
before
one
personally
she
had
never
hesitated
to
step
through
every
one
that
had
been
even
ajar
a
year
in
rome
with
the
old
visconti
who
has
the
most
wonderful
sense
of
rhythm
of
any
man
alive
the
real
the
living
rhythm
the
life
the
personality
of
music
make
yourself
a
docile
little
pair
of
ears
and
nothing
else
when
he
talks
to
you
of
rhythm
and
pay
attention
none
do
you
hear
to
his
fingering
it
is
then
after
a
year
i
shall
be
here
again
to
see
what
else
you
need
before
i
launch
you
good
old
maman
de
la
cueva
will
be
thinking
of
you
all
the
time
but
i
am
not
in
the
least
sure
i
can
manage
a
year
in
rome
protested
marise
breaking
in
with
a
hurried
protest
against
this
of
everything
i
never
dreamed
of
going
to
rome
my
father
oh
you
can
manage
it
madame
de
la
cueva
assured
her
carelessly
one
can
always
manage
whatever
one
really
wants
to
do
especially
if
it
depends
on
a
man
she
crossed
the
room
now
to
pull
at
a
and
to
order
tea
of
the
stout
elderly
maid
who
came
such
a
cosmopolitan
as
madame
de
la
cueva
would
of
course
have
tea
we
shall
have
tea
together
my
dear
to
celebrate
your
birthday
and
my
new
plans
and
to
have
a
last
talk
together
the
last
talk
before
you
grow
up
her
tears
were
forgotten
they
had
been
shed
and
that
was
the
end
of
them
it
was
thus
that
one
should
live
she
believed
crying
heartily
when
one
felt
like
it
and
having
it
over
with
she
detested
what
she
called
the
mania
of
bottling
up
emotion
till
it
grows
so
intense
you
get
no
enjoyment
out
of
it
and
she
was
much
given
to
cautioning
against
this
mania
those
few
of
her
pupils
whom
she
took
seriously
and
for
whom
she
labored
her
valiant
best
pouring
out
for
them
all
her
wisdom
musical
and
otherwise
she
came
back
now
and
sat
before
the
piano
her
amplitude
overflowing
the
stool
as
a
mighty
inflooding
wave
overflows
a
rock
while
giuseppina
is
making
our
tea
i
play
to
you
she
announced
she
put
her
beautiful
hands
on
the
keys
like
a
millionaire
plunging
his
hands
into
a
coffer
of
jewels
and
offering
a
choice
between
pearls
and
rubies
what
will
you
have
what
do
you
feel
like
marise
felt
more
like
an
earthquake
in
full
activity
than
anything
else
and
chose
accordingly
if
i
going
to
rome
for
a
year
i
feel
like
fireworks
she
said
with
a
rather
breathless
laugh
something
hungarian
liszt
perhaps
madame
de
la
cueva
settled
herself
and
was
off
marise
heart
galloping
beside
her
in
the
wild
rush
over
the
plain
the
little
lean
wiry
horse
under
her
tore
along
as
carried
away
by
the
stampede
as
his
rider
there
was
a
lance
in
her
hand
a
lance
with
a
little
ragged
flag
fluttering
loudly
against
the
wind
of
their
forward
rush
like
a
bird
struggling
to
escape
and
fly
marise
heard
its
throbbing
struggle
above
the
rhythmic
thunder
of
the
hoofs
and
felt
her
heart
fluttering
like
a
caught
bird
in
sympathy
and
now
with
a
long
rending
slide
from
bass
to
treble
it
tore
itself
loose
the
wind
caught
it
and
whirled
it
up
high
over
their
heads
as
they
plunged
along
there
it
rode
among
the
clouds
like
a
scarlet
sinking
and
falling
and
advancing
to
a
longer
nobler
more
ample
rhythm
than
that
of
their
clattering
marise
heart
soared
up
with
it
soared
out
of
the
noisy
clattering
up
to
the
clouds
to
the
noble
long
curves
of
the
wind
soundless
advance
soundless
the
piano
was
silent
madame
de
la
cueva
had
played
the
last
velvet
note
that
was
prolonged
prolonged
by
the
sweep
of
that
noble
line
she
and
marise
floated
with
it
for
a
moment
and
then
as
it
swept
on
and
left
them
they
slowly
eddied
down
to
the
ground
like
dry
leaves
giuseppina
came
in
with
the
tea
madame
de
la
cueva
turned
round
on
the
a
fat
elderly
woman
with
three
chins
not
so
bad
for
the
old
lady
hein
she
said
with
herself
and
with
marise
dazzled
look
marise
attempted
no
thanks
no
comment
silently
like
a
person
hypnotized
she
took
the
proffered
cup
nodding
her
desire
for
two
lumps
and
lemon
and
silently
like
a
person
hypnotized
she
listened
to
madame
de
la
cueva
monologue
the
music
like
a
rich
wine
had
unloosed
the
musician
tongue
in
a
mood
like
this
she
turned
the
faucet
and
it
ran
my
little
one
she
said
fondly
to
marise
my
little
one
so
here
you
are
on
the
beach
ready
to
take
the
plunge
and
your
poor
old
de
la
cueva
will
not
be
here
to
advise
you
oh
well
only
one
mistake
that
is
worse
than
giving
advice
and
that
is
taking
it
never
take
anybody
advice
my
darling
nobody
at
all
she
drank
the
half
of
her
cup
of
tea
not
by
any
means
noiselessly
wiped
her
mustache
with
the
tiny
beautifully
fine
embroidered
and
hanging
lovingly
over
the
plate
of
patisseries
chose
the
fluffiest
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
the
only
thing
not
to
do
the
only
mistake
possible
to
make
is
to
stand
shivering
on
the
beach
not
to
plunge
in
and
breast
the
waves
breast
the
waves
she
showed
by
a
wide
gesture
of
her
powerful
arm
what
she
meant
and
you
ca
swim
with
anything
or
anybody
hanging
around
your
neck
the
moment
they
begin
to
weigh
on
you
off
with
them
nothing
you
can
do
will
help
people
who
ca
swim
themselves
only
drag
you
down
with
them
my
dear
child
remember
this
that
if
there
is
an
element
in
life
hateful
to
the
free
human
soul
it
is
what
is
called
permanence
the
only
permanent
thing
any
human
being
should
recognize
is
his
tomb
from
everything
else
he
must
climb
out
and
go
on
go
on
above
all
beware
of
permanence
in
love
it
is
a
paradox
ever
to
speak
of
love
and
permanence
in
the
same
breath
life
and
death
they
can
not
exist
together
women
as
a
rule
all
women
who
are
not
artists
make
their
mistakes
in
that
way
you
are
a
woman
now
and
an
artist
it
is
the
duty
of
an
older
woman
and
an
artist
to
warn
you
against
it
the
only
way
not
to
be
a
victim
of
men
is
to
take
love
as
they
it
for
the
pleasure
men
wish
nothing
from
love
but
their
pleasure
it
is
a
vain
and
foolish
striving
to
try
and
give
them
more
or
to
try
and
get
more
from
them
she
took
another
éclair
and
said
on
a
softer
note
i
do
deny
that
women
are
more
naturally
given
to
the
folly
of
seeking
permanence
in
love
than
men
i
myself
have
a
weakness
in
that
direction
marise
looked
down
into
her
cup
to
hide
an
involuntary
smile
at
this
each
time
i
love
the
illusion
is
that
it
is
now
for
eternity
each
time
the
wrench
costs
me
tears
you
saw
my
tears
my
dear
no
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
use
it
as
men
do
to
feed
one
art
you
heard
how
superbly
i
played
that
liszt
that
is
georges
that
is
the
new
flame
leaping
up
from
a
lamp
that
was
burning
out
she
poured
another
cup
and
seasoned
it
with
care
marise
ventured
to
say
mildly
i
afraid
i
rather
cold
i
do
i
have
ever
cared
much
for
men
madame
de
la
cueva
shook
her
head
every
unawakened
girl
thinks
that
and
once
in
a
while
there
is
a
monster
born
sometimes
a
man
more
often
a
woman
who
is
born
really
cold
like
a
born
or
a
cat
but
any
one
of
experience
can
feel
them
in
the
room
as
you
feel
a
snake
are
not
cold
my
darling
no
one
who
can
play
the
tragica
as
you
do
is
cold
you
are
only
a
child
you
take
so
long
to
ripen
but
all
the
better
for
your
technique
that
quaint
prolongation
of
infancy
but
she
put
down
her
cup
and
looked
at
marise
deeply
and
masterfully
now
your
infancy
has
lasted
long
enough
in
with
you
dive
from
the
nearest
rock
head
over
heels
i
shall
hear
the
splash
from
across
the
world
and
rejoice
marise
laughed
a
little
nervously
partly
because
she
was
amused
and
partly
because
she
was
excited
that
great
mass
of
personality
radiating
magnetism
would
excite
a
statue
on
a
tomb
she
thought
to
herself
even
though
you
did
at
all
share
her
tastes
or
like
the
things
she
did
and
when
i
say
with
you
i
do
mean
any
of
the
sentimental
business
of
becoming
a
with
children
oh
whatever
else
my
dear
no
children
the
only
artists
who
can
afford
to
have
children
are
men
because
men
never
really
love
their
children
and
can
abandon
them
at
any
time
they
need
to
no
woman
can
do
that
even
could
never
have
done
that
you
see
carissima
mea
in
love
a
man
always
keeps
most
of
himself
for
himself
as
in
everything
else
you
must
do
the
same
if
you
are
not
to
be
cheated
in
every
bargain
that
life
offers
you
it
is
a
hard
lesson
to
learn
it
will
cost
you
many
tears
but
tears
are
valuable
you
can
not
live
and
be
an
artist
without
tears
shed
them
freely
and
you
will
see
how
you
will
grow
she
looked
at
her
watch
i
expect
georges
at
five
she
explained
and
swept
on
to
her
peroration
remember
think
of
all
i
tell
you
when
your
wise
old
friend
who
knows
life
is
far
away
remember
none
of
your
nonsense
about
trying
to
get
along
without
take
it
take
all
you
need
of
it
but
keep
it
separate
from
your
real
life
as
a
man
does
and
it
will
never
poison
or
embitter
you
she
laughed
a
little
triumphantly
you
will
all
the
embittering
instead
of
enduring
it
you
have
beauty
you
can
buy
anything
you
want
with
it
if
you
learn
how
to
use
it
you
have
what
will
advance
you
more
than
any
talent
for
music
you
have
a
nice
talent
but
you
will
go
ten
times
as
far
as
a
woman
with
a
big
nose
and
poor
hair
make
your
brain
a
little
mint
my
darling
coin
your
good
looks
into
legal
tender
and
buy
success
she
kissed
the
girl
and
dismissed
her
with
another
look
at
her
watch
and
then
into
the
mirror
marise
stumbled
down
the
stairs
a
little
dizzied
by
the
sudden
removal
of
that
pressing
urgent
magnetic
personality
to
step
out
suddenly
from
under
it
was
like
stepping
into
a
vacuum
her
ears
rang
at
the
she
paused
waiting
for
the
mist
to
clear
from
before
her
eyes
she
peered
out
into
the
quiet
street
as
if
she
were
looking
into
life
itself
the
life
that
madame
de
la
cueva
had
so
magisterially
set
before
her
and
she
loathed
in
anticipation
everything
that
was
waiting
for
her
there
there
lay
the
world
life
rome
her
career
before
her
and
apparently
there
was
nothing
in
it
which
she
would
not
detest
love
the
love
that
madame
de
la
cueva
had
shown
her
how
to
get
she
shrank
away
from
it
with
a
proud
cold
scorn
her
nostrils
quivering
music
there
was
no
music
in
that
program
only
an
exploitation
of
music
to
buy
personal
success
for
her
and
she
loved
music
fiercely
she
clung
to
that
as
the
one
thing
that
would
not
betray
her
the
one
thing
she
dared
love
with
all
her
heart
she
stood
on
the
threshold
of
the
dreading
to
take
even
one
step
forward
into
it
all
till
the
concierge
looked
at
her
hard
with
a
disagreeable
smile
suspecting
a
rendezvous
with
a
lover
marise
saw
the
look
knew
what
it
meant
felt
it
push
her
forward
knew
in
anticipation
how
that
sort
of
look
and
what
lay
back
of
it
would
be
always
pushing
her
forward
into
what
she
hated
with
a
long
breath
she
stepped
into
the
street
into
the
road
that
stretched
before
her
she
held
her
head
high
with
an
angry
pride
the
of
the
world
must
never
know
what
was
inside
her
life
the
thing
to
do
the
only
thing
she
saw
that
was
tolerable
to
do
was
to
take
care
that
she
was
not
being
fooled
well
she
thought
with
a
grave
still
bitterness
she
certainly
ought
to
know
something
about
that
end
of
all
chapter
xli
neale
sat
idly
in
front
of
the
façade
of
the
orvieto
cathedral
trying
idly
to
make
up
his
mind
on
a
matter
of
no
importance
whatever
and
not
getting
on
very
fast
in
his
pocket
was
his
ticket
back
to
new
york
and
his
ship
sailed
in
a
week
but
of
course
it
did
not
sail
from
orvieto
should
he
go
south
to
naples
where
most
of
the
passengers
took
ship
if
he
did
he
could
stop
over
four
or
five
days
in
rome
it
might
be
interesting
to
revisit
rome
or
should
he
go
north
to
genoa
where
the
ship
was
due
to
stop
the
day
after
leaving
naples
he
had
not
seen
genoa
at
all
and
he
might
be
missing
something
worth
while
it
ought
to
stir
any
american
imagination
to
hang
about
the
docks
where
a
certain
visionary
had
gone
up
and
down
trying
to
raise
the
funds
for
a
mad
attempt
to
prove
the
world
absolutely
different
from
what
everybody
else
had
thought
he
sat
there
looking
up
at
the
cathedral
deciding
now
for
genoa
and
now
for
rome
and
in
between
times
forgetting
all
about
the
matter
so
evenly
balanced
were
the
advantages
so
unimportant
was
the
whole
business
when
he
finally
stood
up
to
go
back
to
his
inn
he
remembered
that
he
had
still
not
settled
which
train
to
take
he
took
a
coin
out
of
his
pocket
he
toss
up
heads
for
naples
tails
for
genoa
the
coin
flashed
up
in
the
sun
and
fell
on
the
stone
steps
in
the
intense
somnolent
silence
of
the
little
provincial
square
its
tinkle
sounded
loud
and
clear
all
the
loungers
turned
their
heads
quickly
at
the
sound
neale
stooped
over
it
heads
naples
all
right
he
inquire
when
he
got
to
rome
if
they
did
perhaps
run
a
down
just
before
sailing
time
as
he
was
unstrapping
his
that
night
in
his
room
in
the
roman
pension
it
did
not
greatly
surprise
him
to
have
livingstone
knock
at
the
door
and
step
in
livingstone
had
been
at
that
pension
before
during
neale
first
leisurely
sauntering
visit
to
rome
livingstone
had
turned
up
at
the
pension
in
florence
before
neale
left
he
had
run
across
livingstone
in
a
paris
café
sitting
alone
at
a
table
looking
as
much
like
an
attaché
of
the
embassy
as
he
could
manage
livingstone
was
no
tourist
but
one
of
the
professional
inhabitants
of
europe
an
american
that
much
he
admitted
though
neither
hints
nor
direct
british
questioning
had
ever
extracted
from
him
his
birthplace
in
the
states
he
was
the
sort
of
man
who
had
learned
how
to
cross
his
long
thin
legs
elegantly
so
that
the
toe
of
one
slim
foot
pointed
downward
as
at
the
same
time
he
was
wont
to
fold
his
arms
over
his
hollowed
chest
stoop
his
shoulders
and
droop
his
neck
and
as
he
wore
gray
gaiters
and
carried
a
walking
stick
he
had
good
reason
to
flatter
himself
that
he
had
altogether
the
distinguished
pinched
sickly
aristocratic
look
of
the
traditional
promising
diplomat
neale
was
not
surprised
to
see
him
in
rome
he
would
not
have
been
surprised
to
see
him
anywhere
except
perhaps
at
work
it
was
neale
guess
that
three
or
four
years
from
now
he
would
have
screwed
up
his
courage
to
wearing
a
monocle
hello
crittenden
he
said
it
you
is
it
when
michele
told
me
you
had
turned
up
again
i
was
sure
he
must
be
mistaken
i
understood
you
were
on
the
high
seas
on
your
way
back
to
the
land
of
the
free
and
the
home
of
bad
cooking
without
being
invited
he
sank
down
in
a
chair
to
watch
neale
unpack
and
wash
asking
you
were
going
back
to
new
york
were
you
yes
i
still
am
i
only
in
rome
for
five
days
but
i
wo
be
long
in
the
states
i
be
on
my
way
to
china
and
the
east
livingstone
was
mildly
interested
you
do
say
so
well
you
might
really
get
there
by
starting
off
to
new
york
but
i
admit
i
do
see
the
connection
why
do
you
take
a
and
for
india
a
little
business
to
attend
to
first
a
small
inheritance
to
cash
in
on
inheritance
cried
livingstone
sitting
up
straight
the
very
word
makes
my
mouth
water
why
does
that
ever
happen
to
me
the
expression
on
his
face
was
like
that
of
the
loungers
in
front
of
the
cathedral
when
they
heard
the
coin
drop
through
the
lather
of
on
his
face
neale
laughed
a
very
inheritance
an
old
i
hardly
knew
never
saw
him
but
once
or
twice
years
ago
when
i
was
a
kid
left
me
his
home
and
his
little
and
plant
back
up
at
the
end
of
nowhere
in
vermont
money
sympathized
livingstone
but
then
of
course
you
can
sell
all
that
for
but
no
real
money
at
all
there
what
he
had
in
the
savings
bank
about
four
thousand
dollars
the
executor
writes
just
enough
to
do
nothing
at
all
with
livingstone
made
a
mental
calculation
i
would
wonder
if
you
might
get
fifty
dollars
a
month
out
of
the
whole
thing
and
that
enough
ma
foi
that
enough
if
you
cut
corners
a
little
only
have
and
then
you
can
always
give
an
occasional
english
lesson
to
piece
out
you
wo
need
ever
to
do
a
lick
of
work
or
ever
live
in
the
states
mes
felicitations
that
the
life
you
be
knowing
europe
as
well
as
i
do
next
how
soon
will
you
be
back
i
not
coming
back
said
neale
buttoning
on
a
clean
collar
when
i
cashed
in
and
got
what
i
can
out
of
my
uncle
business
i
going
overland
to
san
francisco
and
from
there
to
the
east
livingstone
considered
this
well
they
do
say
that
chinese
cooking
is
once
you
get
used
to
it
i
not
going
for
the
cooking
no
what
you
going
for
oh
i
do
know
said
neale
rather
sharply
because
i
feel
like
it
why
should
i
livingstone
perceived
that
he
had
run
on
a
hidden
reef
and
backed
off
do
you
want
to
come
on
into
the
salon
and
let
me
present
you
to
the
crowd
he
asked
standing
up
and
moving
towards
the
door
since
you
were
here
some
awfully
nice
people
have
come
over
from
the
pension
alfierenti
poor
old
alfierenti
died
suddenly
and
his
place
is
shut
up
for
the
present
no
thanks
said
neale
i
going
up
on
the
roof
for
a
smoke
before
i
go
to
bed
oh
yes
livingstone
remembered
you
always
did
prefer
the
terrazza
and
your
solitary
pipe
to
the
society
of
the
ladies
well
there
is
a
nice
view
from
up
there
but
between
a
view
and
a
pretty
girl
who
could
hesitate
who
indeed
said
neale
dryly
going
off
up
the
stairs
the
plaster
floor
and
low
walls
of
the
terrazza
gleamed
white
and
empty
as
neale
had
hoped
there
was
not
a
soul
there
below
him
spread
the
roofs
and
domes
and
streets
of
rome
even
in
the
white
light
of
the
moon
hanging
like
a
great
lamp
over
the
city
he
took
the
corner
that
had
been
his
favorite
before
in
the
black
shadow
cast
by
a
grapevine
and
perching
on
the
edge
of
the
wall
looked
down
meditatively
on
the
city
as
he
filled
his
pipe
well
so
here
he
was
in
rome
just
as
if
something
had
pushed
him
here
where
least
of
all
places
he
had
expected
to
find
himself
again
odd
that
his
year
of
travel
should
end
with
a
second
visit
to
the
first
european
city
that
had
stirred
his
imagination
that
had
given
him
a
hint
of
what
it
was
he
had
come
to
europe
to
see
it
was
during
his
first
stay
in
rome
that
he
stopped
being
a
dumb
tourist
that
he
first
got
the
idea
of
what
europe
might
teach
him
better
than
america
could
it
was
here
that
he
first
thought
of
trying
to
get
from
europe
some
idea
of
what
men
during
a
good
many
centuries
had
found
worth
doing
for
unlike
america
europe
was
crammed
full
of
objects
little
and
big
that
men
alone
or
in
groups
had
devoted
their
lives
to
create
america
had
tried
a
number
of
experiments
once
but
europe
had
tried
them
all
so
many
times
at
such
different
periods
in
so
many
so
various
centers
of
civilization
such
a
crowded
graveyard
of
human
endeavor
might
perhaps
suggest
a
satisfactory
motive
if
one
existed
for
going
on
living
for
a
long
time
he
had
made
no
headway
had
discovered
no
general
underlying
motive
indeed
much
of
what
he
saw
filled
him
with
utter
astonishment
at
the
things
men
had
cared
for
even
to
the
point
of
giving
their
lives
to
win
them
he
still
remembered
that
morning
during
his
first
stay
when
he
had
stared
with
stupefaction
at
the
rows
of
in
the
capitoline
museum
so
many
men
most
of
them
apparently
intelligent
had
schemed
and
plotted
through
long
years
and
what
for
to
be
the
conventional
head
of
an
unworkable
empire
with
administration
to
endure
the
hideous
tedium
of
ceremony
and
pompous
ritual
which
the
office
had
imposed
to
be
forced
to
work
through
sycophants
and
grafters
to
be
exiled
from
healthy
human
life
into
a
region
where
in
the
nature
of
things
you
could
never
hope
to
see
one
spontaneous
sincere
expression
on
any
human
face
where
your
life
your
work
your
reputation
hung
on
the
whim
of
the
prætorian
guard
or
the
disgruntled
legions
on
a
distant
frontier
why
if
you
lay
awake
nights
you
could
think
of
a
more
thankless
job
than
being
a
roman
emperor
and
yet
for
centuries
men
had
sacrificed
their
friends
their
honor
their
very
lives
to
hold
the
office
those
old
romans
for
all
they
looked
so
like
ordinary
everyday
men
you
meet
in
the
street
must
have
had
a
queer
notion
of
what
was
in
life
then
he
had
left
rome
and
gone
away
without
plan
anywhere
the
train
would
take
him
and
wherever
he
had
gone
he
had
walked
about
silently
attentive
to
what
men
had
done
with
their
lives
that
was
what
he
had
been
looking
for
as
he
walked
around
on
or
gazed
up
at
cathedrals
or
looked
seriously
at
the
statues
as
the
sands
of
the
sea
all
over
european
cities
that
was
what
he
had
been
looking
for
as
he
sat
alone
in
a
pension
reading
a
history
or
a
biography
that
helped
him
fit
together
into
some
sort
of
a
system
all
the
diverse
objects
he
had
been
considering
wherever
he
went
wherever
he
looked
he
was
like
an
archæologist
raking
over
an
inexhaustible
he
was
surrounded
by
relics
of
innumerable
generations
crowding
the
long
centuries
during
which
men
had
lived
and
died
on
this
old
continent
perhaps
if
he
looked
hard
enough
at
what
they
had
left
behind
them
he
might
find
out
what
men
really
wanted
to
do
with
their
lives
perhaps
he
might
get
some
hint
of
what
he
could
do
with
his
own
life
that
was
a
subject
he
had
never
stopped
to
consider
in
america
nothing
in
american
life
had
suggested
that
you
might
have
any
choice
except
between
different
ways
of
earning
your
living
and
yet
he
reflected
it
was
rather
an
important
question
at
least
as
important
as
which
baseball
league
you
were
going
to
root
for
it
was
so
absolutely
new
to
neale
to
consider
that
question
any
abstract
question
indeed
that
for
some
months
after
he
had
shut
down
his
desk
in
the
office
of
the
gates
lumber
company
he
felt
his
head
whirl
at
the
notion
of
trying
to
find
an
answer
an
answer
to
any
question
let
alone
so
compendious
a
one
as
what
it
was
that
men
wanted
to
do
with
their
lives
the
cogs
and
wheels
of
disinterested
impersonal
thought
which
had
started
to
work
in
college
were
stiff
with
disuse
and
refused
to
turn
all
he
had
been
able
to
do
was
to
wonder
and
stare
and
read
memoirs
and
histories
feeling
like
a
strange
cat
in
a
very
much
cluttered
garret
was
there
anything
in
europe
that
would
really
mean
anything
to
him
to
an
american
who
was
not
esthetic
who
refused
to
pretend
who
frankly
thought
the
average
a
dreary
desert
and
then
very
slowly
he
had
begun
to
make
a
guess
that
there
was
an
arrangement
in
what
looked
so
wildly
as
on
the
day
when
happening
upon
the
little
triumphal
arch
in
rheims
he
had
at
last
got
under
his
skin
the
idea
of
the
roman
empire
permeating
with
its
law
customs
speech
the
tiniest
crevices
of
the
provinces
to
think
of
romans
living
and
governing
and
doing
business
in
a
little
gallic
town
like
this
maybe
it
had
been
such
a
crazy
aspiration
to
want
to
be
emperor
sort
of
like
being
president
of
the
standard
oil
company
you
knew
in
your
heart
that
the
job
was
too
big
for
any
man
but
it
was
warming
to
your
imagination
even
to
pretend
you
were
running
a
machine
that
covered
the
whole
known
world
and
probably
all
of
them
had
an
illogical
hunch
that
would
get
away
with
it
and
by
jupiter
a
lot
of
them
had
and
died
peacefully
in
their
beds
after
all
so
far
as
ordinary
went
devoting
yourself
to
gathering
together
a
great
deal
more
money
than
you
could
possibly
use
at
least
as
odd
a
way
of
spending
a
human
life
as
trying
to
hang
on
to
the
tail
of
the
roman
empire
and
yet
there
were
countless
thousands
of
men
all
over
europe
as
well
as
in
the
united
states
who
were
hoping
with
all
their
souls
that
fate
would
allow
them
to
do
just
that
and
a
few
did
get
away
with
it
just
as
some
of
the
emperors
had
but
it
killed
a
great
many
the
manager
of
the
gates
lumber
company
for
instance
every
man
knew
that
it
might
be
the
death
of
him
just
as
in
the
first
century
an
emperor
knew
he
be
lucky
if
he
were
killed
quick
but
nobody
hung
back
for
that
in
either
century
nobody
really
believed
it
would
get
why
a
year
ago
neale
crittenden
himself
had
been
tearing
along
towards
it
as
hard
as
he
could
pelt
well
good
god
you
had
to
do
with
yourself
you
float
along
your
boneless
tentacles
rising
and
falling
with
the
tides
like
that
of
a
livingstone
what
was
there
for
a
man
to
do
with
himself
at
all
times
evidently
some
men
had
been
satisfied
in
producing
art
of
some
kind
or
another
that
was
any
good
for
neale
he
had
an
ounce
of
artistic
feeling
was
even
a
craftsman
let
alone
an
artist
and
many
men
in
every
epoch
had
cared
about
fighting
that
was
more
his
sort
if
you
were
sure
you
could
find
something
worth
fighting
for
and
many
men
had
wanted
to
run
things
not
only
for
the
feeling
of
personal
power
but
to
straighten
out
the
hopeless
muddles
humanity
was
always
getting
itself
into
he
had
lost
the
frail
thread
of
his
thought
in
a
maze
of
speculations
comparisons
ambitions
but
he
had
always
come
back
to
his
problem
he
did
not
hurry
he
had
left
the
gates
lumber
company
so
that
he
would
not
need
to
hurry
sometimes
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
thread
lost
it
felt
it
between
his
closing
fingers
let
it
slip
again
and
whenever
it
escaped
him
and
he
found
himself
staring
again
at
a
jumbled
confusion
with
no
clue
to
its
pattern
he
had
lit
his
pipe
and
smoked
reflectively
his
eyes
fixed
on
whatever
detail
of
european
life
chanced
to
be
before
them
a
window
at
chartres
a
crowded
noisy
café
in
milan
the
hydraulic
cranes
unloading
cargoes
from
the
congo
under
the
tower
of
antwerp
cathedral
what
men
had
left
behind
them
looked
from
the
outside
like
a
pile
of
heterogeneous
junk
some
good
and
some
bad
and
no
way
of
guessing
how
any
of
it
came
to
be
but
neale
hung
fast
to
that
guess
of
his
that
there
might
be
some
meaning
for
him
in
it
all
if
he
could
only
be
patient
enough
and
enough
to
pick
it
out
he
had
never
been
an
impatient
temperament
but
he
certainly
had
not
of
late
years
been
especially
during
this
reflective
pause
in
his
life
he
felt
his
mind
its
capacity
to
do
some
abstract
thinking
released
temporarily
as
he
was
from
the
necessity
for
immediate
activity
his
head
slowly
cleared
itself
from
the
cloudy
fumes
given
off
by
energy
automatically
rushing
into
action
blindly
planlessly
he
began
to
perceive
that
he
had
been
carried
off
his
feet
by
the
conviction
of
his
time
that
activity
any
activity
at
all
is
provided
it
is
taken
with
speed
energy
and
decision
neale
had
acquired
speed
energy
and
decision
in
activity
but
he
be
damned
he
told
himself
once
in
a
while
if
he
run
his
legs
off
any
longer
without
seeing
which
way
he
was
going
as
he
sat
now
alone
on
the
roof
overlooking
the
many
many
monuments
left
as
token
of
what
men
had
wanted
to
do
with
their
lives
he
brought
up
and
considered
the
few
conclusions
the
guesses
at
truth
the
year
had
brought
him
they
did
seem
to
amount
to
much
they
were
ridiculously
slight
as
the
of
a
year
earnest
thought
but
all
this
sort
of
thinking
was
so
new
and
hard
for
him
at
least
such
as
they
were
they
were
his
own
thoughts
he
had
taken
them
on
anybody
else
and
simple
and
inadequate
as
they
seemed
from
the
outside
they
might
be
the
first
step
towards
understanding
the
truth
the
truth
for
to
begin
with
he
had
in
the
least
found
out
what
men
wanted
or
why
they
wanted
it
all
his
classification
had
been
like
pressing
and
sticking
them
in
a
herbarium
with
the
right
latin
name
tacked
on
it
cleared
up
some
of
the
clutter
perhaps
but
it
left
you
mighty
far
from
understanding
life
all
that
he
had
learned
from
his
classification
was
that
men
wanted
a
lot
of
contradictory
things
and
what
one
man
would
sell
his
soul
to
get
would
break
another
one
heart
to
have
well
was
that
perhaps
a
clue
was
it
just
that
innate
diversity
which
was
at
the
root
of
a
great
many
tragedies
was
the
trouble
that
men
would
let
themselves
act
as
individuals
men
were
so
hopelessly
tied
to
the
fashion
of
their
century
yes
men
were
they
had
no
call
to
laugh
at
of
women
cared
about
clothes
and
every
woman
except
a
few
dowds
was
out
to
look
like
every
other
woman
and
just
a
little
more
so
men
cared
about
the
business
of
the
world
and
every
man
except
a
few
freaks
felt
that
he
ought
to
outdo
every
one
else
at
whatever
all
the
men
of
his
time
were
doing
and
nobody
wanted
to
be
a
freak
but
the
truth
was
that
there
were
all
sorts
of
men
in
the
world
all
the
time
who
ought
normally
to
do
all
sorts
of
different
things
but
did
they
no
they
did
no
matter
what
you
really
wanted
to
do
with
your
life
no
matter
what
your
particular
life
was
best
suited
for
human
tradition
was
always
inflexibly
insisting
that
you
try
to
cut
your
life
by
the
pattern
considered
fashionable
at
the
time
and
in
the
place
where
you
lived
try
to
be
an
emperor
in
imperial
rome
try
to
be
a
millionaire
in
twentieth
century
new
york
people
did
seem
able
to
consider
even
for
a
moment
that
there
must
be
lots
of
men
so
made
that
they
would
prefer
anything
to
the
process
of
becoming
an
emperor
or
a
millionaire
there
rose
before
neale
now
the
restless
unhappy
face
of
the
young
frenchman
he
had
come
to
know
in
bourges
who
one
evening
as
they
sat
in
the
park
near
the
cathedral
poured
out
to
him
in
a
bitter
flood
his
horrified
sense
of
the
closing
in
on
him
of
bonds
which
he
hated
which
were
being
forged
around
him
by
the
irresistible
forces
of
social
tradition
and
family
affection
fighting
helplessly
against
overwhelming
odds
he
was
slowly
being
shoved
into
becoming
a
in
bourges
for
all
his
life
in
this
he
had
cried
looking
around
him
with
wild
young
eyes
like
a
rat
in
a
trap
but
there
was
his
dear
maman
certainty
that
this
feeling
was
mere
youth
that
he
would
soon
settle
down
and
be
contented
in
his
office
and
always
always
be
quite
close
to
her
there
was
the
relief
of
the
family
far
and
wide
now
that
he
was
safe
for
life
in
a
good
little
position
with
a
nice
little
pension
at
the
end
safe
how
i
loathe
being
safe
he
had
cried
why
was
i
born
three
hundred
years
ago
so
that
i
could
have
gone
out
with
champlain
or
later
with
du
chaillou
in
spite
of
all
his
sympathy
for
the
poor
kid
neale
had
seen
then
nor
could
he
see
now
why
anybody
need
wait
for
a
champlain
or
a
du
chaillou
to
come
along
it
looked
as
though
the
boy
grievance
was
because
what
he
was
meant
to
do
did
happen
to
be
in
fashion
when
he
lived
neale
could
see
what
prevented
him
from
getting
right
up
on
his
feet
from
off
the
bench
where
he
agonized
and
marching
off
to
the
nearest
port
to
work
his
way
to
senegal
if
that
was
where
he
thought
he
have
the
chance
to
use
that
latent
stifled
something
in
him
which
could
never
live
in
bourges
of
course
it
would
give
his
mother
a
jolt
but
if
she
was
any
kind
of
a
mother
she
want
her
son
to
have
what
was
best
for
him
that
was
sure
if
anything
was
and
as
for
the
cousins
and
the
aunts
and
uncles
butting
in
to
hell
with
them
what
business
was
it
of
theirs
neale
had
a
suspicion
that
very
likely
the
boy
would
be
horrified
by
senegal
not
get
on
a
bit
better
than
in
bourges
and
be
mighty
glad
to
come
back
to
the
safeness
and
comfort
that
irked
him
so
now
if
he
had
had
pep
enough
to
get
on
in
senegal
or
anywhere
else
on
his
own
would
he
have
had
pep
enough
to
cut
loose
from
his
before
this
now
was
the
time
to
do
it
now
or
never
before
he
had
acquired
any
personal
responsibilities
of
his
own
choosing
that
would
be
an
insuperable
barrier
to
change
neale
felt
nothing
but
the
profoundest
sympathy
for
people
who
found
out
they
were
in
the
wrong
after
they
had
tied
themselves
up
so
they
could
move
that
was
so
awful
a
fate
that
it
did
seem
as
though
all
ought
to
league
together
in
an
impassioned
effort
to
give
youth
as
free
a
choice
as
possible
instead
of
which
look
what
they
done
to
this
poor
kid
neale
knew
by
the
look
of
him
how
nervously
sensitive
he
was
they
trained
nervous
sensibility
into
him
instead
of
energy
and
combativeness
and
then
they
brought
to
bear
on
him
the
pressure
of
public
opinion
which
provincial
and
family
life
in
a
small
french
town
exerts
on
youth
to
prevent
its
ever
guessing
at
its
essential
freedom
to
seek
out
its
own
what
sheep
men
were
making
long
detours
through
open
country
to
get
around
fences
that
had
long
since
blown
down
in
all
the
centuries
of
roman
emperors
had
there
been
a
single
one
of
the
misfits
with
good
enough
sense
to
see
that
he
had
got
into
the
wrong
job
and
energy
enough
to
pull
out
galba
had
declined
the
nomination
a
term
or
two
but
in
the
end
he
accepted
office
and
got
his
throat
cut
inside
a
year
even
a
mind
like
marcus
aurelius
could
think
of
no
solution
except
after
to
write
a
book
sympathizing
with
himself
like
a
corporation
president
solacing
his
soul
by
collecting
cloisonné
of
course
the
fashion
of
the
country
and
the
century
was
sure
to
fit
some
men
old
man
gates
now
he
wanted
to
succeed
in
business
to
be
a
millionaire
as
much
as
vespasian
had
wanted
to
be
emperor
and
he
had
furiously
enjoyed
every
moment
of
the
struggle
which
had
carried
him
up
from
owning
a
small
in
connecticut
to
being
the
head
of
a
rich
and
powerful
company
he
had
died
at
eighty
as
lusty
and
hard
and
sound
an
old
condottiere
as
any
other
professional
fighter
who
bestrode
a
bronze
horse
in
an
italian
piazza
but
how
about
his
son
what
perhaps
would
the
young
gates
have
liked
to
do
with
life
if
it
had
ever
been
suggested
to
him
that
he
might
do
something
else
than
go
on
making
money
by
selling
lumber
for
as
much
as
possible
above
the
price
that
had
been

for

what
had
resulted
in
that
dreadful
twisted
weeping
elderly
face
which
even
now
neale
could
not
forget
neale
puffed
a
while
silently
staring
over
at
the
janiculum
hill
black
with
its
dense
trees
beyond
the
moonlit
city
until
the
distressing
memory
became
less
acute
and
he
could
go
back
calmly
to
his
own
problem
he
was
that
much
to
the
good
anyhow
at
least
he
found
out
what
he
did
not
want
to
do
he
did
not
want
to
give
his
life
to
doing
something
simply
because
a
lot
of
other
men
thought
it
was
the
only
thing
to
do
at
least
he
was
sure
that
failure
was
certain
along
that
road
and
he
was
convinced
that
happiness
satisfaction
at
least
was
possible
in
human
life
all
his
and
accumulated
health
and
strength
and
vitality
made
him
sure
that
a
sort
of
happiness
was
probable
even
inevitable
if
you
had
the
good
sense
to
get
hold
of
the
job
you
were
intended
to
do
but
what
did
he
neale
crittenden
want
to
do
what
was
he
intended
for
he
had
asked
himself
that
question
a
great
many
times
and
never
had
answered
it
yet
he
looked
again
over
at
the
janiculum
from
which
the
beacon
was
flashing
its
message
of
red
white
green
across
imperial
rome
across
the
vatican
over
there
stood
the
garibaldi
monument
there
was
a
man
who
had
known
what
to
do
with
his
life
he
had
created
something
oh
he
was
a
product
of
his
time
no
doubt
and
the
busy
little
cavour
had
played
a
necessary
part
but
admitting
all
that
where
would
the
risorgimento
have
been
without
garibaldi
in
the
fire
and
passion
of
his
great
heart
he
had
forged
the
sword
of
italian
unity
out
of
chaos
he
had
created
something
with
an
ordered
unity
of
its
own
that
was
real
creation
was
there
any
of
it
left
to
do
some
little
corner
that
an
ordinary
man
could
tackle
alone
on
the
roof
he
pondered
this
his
hands
clasped
across
his
knees
his
head
tipped
back
looking
across
the
ancient
city
at
the
man
who
had
kindled
a
fire
in
those
old
ashes
and
then
little
by
little
as
the
silence
and
beauty
of
the
night
spread
out
before
his
eyes
in
widening
silver
circles
he
ceased
pondering
ceased
thinking
even
vaguely
of
himself
his
life
other
men
lives
he
sat
dreaming
his
eyes
as
wide
as
a
child
his
lips
relaxed
his
face
absent
and
unconscious
of
self
as
that
of
one
who
listens
absorbed
and
entranced
to
distant
music
moonlight
italy
aware
that
he
was
no
longer
alone
he
turned
his
head
slowly
and
saw
that
a
tall
girl
in
white
had
come
silently
up
the
winding
iron
steps
and
was
standing
at
the
top
looking
at
the
sky
the
moon
shone
full
and
soft
upon
her
from
head
to
foot
he
saw
her
as
clearly
as
though
it
had
been
noon
and
yet
she
looked
as
unearthly
and
mysterious
as
the
night
she
evidently
thought
herself
alone
she
stood
perfectly
motionless
her
dark
eyes
fixed
on
a
palely
distant
star
neale
thought
he
had
never
in
his
life
seen
anything
more
touching
than
the
profound
sadness
of
her
young
face
he
had
not
moved
had
scarcely
had
time
to
draw
breath
but
she
had
felt
him
there
she
turned
her
face
toward
where
he
sat
her
head
a
little
bent
searching
the
darkness
of
the
corner
from
under
long
brows
she
saw
him
looked
straight
into
his
eyes
her
own
shining
deep
and
soft
upon
him
he
was
still
too
lost
in
his
own
enchanted
dream
to
be
able
to
move
to
look
away
he
gazed
at
her
as
though
she
were
part
of
the
night
of
the
beauty
without
a
sound
she
turned
back
and
sank
like
a
dream
from
his
sight
chapter
xlii
the
next
morning
very
early
when
he
stepped
out
of
his
room
he
saw
at
the
end
of
the
hall
a
little
group
of
three
people
the
burly
boy
who
carried
and
blacked
shoes
the
tall
aproned
who
swept
the
rooms
and
waited
on
the
table
and
the
girl
he
had
seen
on
the
roof
the
night
before
he
knew
her
at
once
although
she
was
in
a
now
and
he
saw
only
her
back
and
the
gleaming
coils
of
her
hair
he
found
that
he
had
no
intention
of
doing
anything
in
the
world
but
of
going
to
speak
to
her
somehow
and
turning
down
the
tiled
corridor
he
walked
towards
the
three
they
had
their
backs
towards
him
and
were
all
talking
italian
with
extreme
rapidity
oh
it
came
to
neale
with
a
shock
she
was
an
italian
of
course
with
those
dark
eyes
and
hair
it
had
not
once
occurred
to
him
during
the
night
that
she
might
be
an
italian
he
felt
hot
with
vexation
damn
it
he
spoke
so
little
italian
he
stopped
short
in
the
irresolute
suffering
that
most
wretched
and
miserable
of
human
embarrassments
the
one
that
began
with
the
tower
of
babel
he
was
going
to
make
an
idiot
of
himself
trying
to
talk
to
her
in
that
horrible
broken
of
his
his
disappointment
was
so
acute
that
he
could
not
for
an
instant
collect
himself
enough
to
turn
away
and
stood
glowering
at
the
three
backs
they
were
talking
far
too
rapidly
for
him
to
understand
what
they
said
but
by
their
pantomime
it
was
plain
that
the
girl
was
moved
by
something
which
left
the
two
men
quite
unaffected
that
she
was
making
a
agitated
appeal
to
them
which
they
received
with
the
shrugged
shoulders
and
uplifted
eyebrows
of
reasonable
men
before
an
unreasonable
idea
she
was
pointing
out
leaning
forward
shrinking
back
she
was
saying
oh
oh
her
low
voice
rising
to
a
little
wail
of
distress
that
went
to
neale
heart
he
looked
over
their
backs
out
of
the
window
following
the
direction
of
the
girl
hand
and
saw
at
first
only
the
beautiful
swoop
of
the
roman
swallows
filling
the
bright
air
with
their
rhythmic
wheelings
he
had
watched
them
for
hours
on
his
former
visit
had
thought
them
one
of
the
most
purely
lovely
elements
of
the
city
charm
oh
cried
the
girl
again
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
neale
saw
at
last
what
she
saw
a
lean
yellow
cat
crouching
in
ambush
in
a
corner
between
a
dormer
window
and
a
as
he
looked
the
cat
sprang
up
suddenly
a
streak
of
murdering
speed
high
into
the
air
and
seized
an
incautious
swallow
swooping
too
low
the
two
men
at
the
window
looked
at
the
girl
shrugged
their
shoulders
again
and
went
back
coolly
to
their
work
the
comedy
was
finished
what
could
any
one
do
about
it
most
evidently
nothing
the
man
lifted
his
broom
to
sweep
the
boy
stooped
to
take
up
his
the
girl
took
her
hands
from
her
face
and
turned
away
from
the
window
neale
had
expected
to
see
her
look
agitated
and
excited
but
her
pale
face
was
set
in
an
expression
of
unsurprised
endurance
it
was
evident
that
she
too
perceived
that
there
was
nothing
to
do
about
it
well
there
something
to
do
about
it
thought
neale
wildly
feeling
a
fury
of
resentment
at
the
two
men
he
show
them
he
sprang
past
the
girl
with
a
great
bound
to
the
window
and
saw
that
as
he
thought
a
slope
of
tiled
roof
lay
below
it
the
slope
so
gentle
the
tiles
so
rough
that
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
keep
his
footing
on
it
although
the
drop
to
the
court
below
would
be
dizzying
if
he
stopped
to
look
at
it
but
he
did
not
stop
to
look
at
that
or
anything
but
the
cat
slinking
slowly
off
across
the
roof
beyond
the
swallow
in
her
mouth
he
took
one
long
step
out
over
the
low
and
stood
on
the
tiles
he
heard
the
girl
behind
him
give
a
cry
and
it
sped
him
forward
he
ran
along
the
narrow
slope
of
tiles
one
hand
on
the
wall
to
steady
himself
till
he
could
with
a
leap
reach
the
roof
where
the
cat
was
making
off
towards
the
with
her
prey
here
it
was
easier
a
wide
stretch
of
tiles
over
which
he
could
really
run
the
cat
heard
him
saw
him
paused
an
instant
dazed
by
the
suddenness
of
his
appearance
turned
her
head
and
flattened
herself
for
a
leap
forward
but
his
leap
was
quicker
than
hers
he
reached
her
and
pounced
on
her
with
a
swoop
that
was
part
of
the
forward
rhythm
of
his
running
pounced
seized
her
firmly
and
forced
open
her
jaws
the
swallow
dropped
out
on
the
tiles
wet
and
ruffled
its
eyes
closed
its
poor
slim
gleaming
head
bent
limply
to
one
side
as
if
its
neck
were
broken
neale
stooped
and
picked
it
up
stroking
it
pityingly
and
smoothing
its
pretty
rumpled
plumes
he
had
been
too
late
after
all
but
as
it
lay
in
his
hand
it
seemed
to
him
he
felt
its
delicate
body
stir
perhaps
it
was
only
half
dead
with
fright
did
it
move
a
little
or
had
he
imagined
it
as
he
stood
astride
the
of
the
roof
the
level
rays
of
the
early
sun
shone
straight
into
his
eyes
so
that
he
could
not
see
whether
the
bird
eyes
had
opened
or
not
he
turned
his
back
to
the
sun
and
held
his
hand
with
the
bird
in
it
closer
to
his
face
why
yes
the
eyes
were
open
soft
dark
eyes
that
looked
wildly
and
despairingly
into
his
the
intensity
of
that
sudden
look
gave
him
a
start
he
opened
his
fingers
and
the
bird
burst
out
of
his
hand
with
a
loud
beating
flutter
and
soared
up
into
the
air
neale
threw
back
his
head
to
watch
it
moved
almost
to
a
shout
of
exultation
as
the
twittering
flock
swooped
past
his
head
then
he
saw
that
the
cat
was
calmly
making
her
way
back
to
her
ambush
corner
hey
there
he
shouted
gaily
at
her
and
sprinting
along
snatched
her
up
you
going
back
down
cellar
to
catch
rats
kitty
mio
he
told
her
aloud
laughing
he
was
astonished
at
his
own
high
spirits
high
up
on
the
richly
colored
old
roof
close
to
that
glorious
sun
with
the
swallows
dashing
twittering
about
his
head
the
rescued
one
among
them
he
could
have
flung
his
arms
about
and
danced
for
sheer
lightness
of
heart
what
he
did
was
to
tuck
the
protesting
cat
under
his
arm
and
make
his
way
back
with
considerably
more
caution
than
he
had
gone
up
the
passage
along
the
narrow
slope
of
tile
below
the
window
was
worse
than
he
had
thought
made
him
a
little
sick
to
face
a
performance
anyhow
he
reflected
picking
his
steps
looking
carefully
away
from
the
sheer
black
drop
to
the
courtyard
below
him
a
very
performance
for
a
man
of
to
go
careering
over
roofs
like
that
with
a
short
breath
of
relief
he
stepped
over
the
back
into
the
corridor
the
men
and
the
girl
who
had
been
leaning
tensely
out
watching
him
stepped
back
respectfully
to
give
him
room
before
he
could
turn
to
the
girl
the
servant
had
snatched
the
cat
from
under
his
arm
and
with
a
fine
air
of
virtuous
indignation
was
cuffing
her
savagely
over
the
head
pouring
out
on
her
a
loud
flood
of
vituperation
the
boy
lifted
his
hand
to
join
in
the
game
crying
out
bestia
del
diavolo
animaluzzo
dannato
and
the
like
oh
good
lord
thought
neale
impatiently
is
that
just
them
hey
that
he
cried
aloud
and
as
the
man
paid
no
attention
to
this
he
seized
him
somewhat
roughly
by
the
shoulder
in
a
grip
that
paralyzed
the
arm
he
caught
the
cat
as
she
fell
and
held
her
up
over
his
head
he
was
so
tall
so
that
she
now
dangled
high
in
the
air
quite
out
of
reach
yowling
at
the
top
of
her
voice
a
ridiculous
scene
altogether
he
tried
sternly
to
explain
his
feelings
and
issue
his
commands
but
as
was
to
be
expected
his
italian
gave
way
under
the
strain
troppo
in
ritardo
punire
il
gatto
it
too
late
to
jump
on
the
cat
you
poor
chump
she
would
have
any
idea
what
it
for
gatto
non
capisce
it
not
her
fault
anyhow
she
does
know
any
better
take
her
down
cellar
dans
la
cave
she
all
right
catching
rats
that
what
she
for
and
look
here
he
stopped
his
pitiful
attempt
at
italian
and
ended
fiercely
trusting
to
a
grim
eye
and
a
set
jaw
to
make
his
meaning
plain
do
you
try
any
funny
business
on
the
cat
when
not
around
or
i
knock
your
heads
together
till
you
ca
see
he
heard
the
girl
speak
to
the
men
in
an
italian
that
was
so
rapid
it
made
him
dizzy
and
at
the
end
caught
the
phrase
do
you
understand
the
men
nodded
by
no
means
pleased
at
the
rebuff
the
boy
motioned
neale
to
give
him
the
cat
and
carried
her
off
carefully
down
the
corridor
that
was
the
very
most
splendid
thing
for
you
to
do
the
girl
said
to
him
with
a
soft
energy
of
accent
he
whirled
about
towards
her
the
immensity
of
his
relief
flooding
his
face
oh
you
speak
english
you
italian
he
cried
the
intonation
of
his
phrase
seeming
to
indicate
that
she
had
lifted
from
his
mind
an
apprehension
of
infinitely
long
standing
oh
yes
she
said
smiling
and
looking
directly
at
him
of
course
i
speak
english
i
an
american
girl
my
name
is
marise
allen
neale
was
so
affected
by
the
sweetness
of
her
smile
on
him
by
the
softness
of
her
shining
dark
eyes
that
he
felt
himself
blushing
and
stammering
like
a
little
boy
is
neale
crittenden
he
answered
chapter
xliii
the
arabian
night
unexpectedness
which
had
descended
on
neale
the
evening
before
on
the
roof
continued
shimmeringly
to
wrap
everything
in
improbability
instead
of
receiving
his
unfamiliar
name
with
the
vague
conventional
smile
of
a
new
acquaintance
the
girl
raised
her
eyebrows
high
in
a
long
delicate
arch
and
cried
out
you
are
really
the
one
who
has
inherited
crittenden
seeing
look
of
almost
appalled
amazement
she
broke
into
a
sudden
laugh
neale
had
never
heard
any
one
laugh
like
that
almost
like
some
one
singing
so
clear
and
purely
produced
was
its
little
trill
and
yet
it
had
been
as
sudden
and
spontaneous
as
a
gush
of
water
from
a
spring
i
do
wonder
you
look
astonished
she
told
him
but
you
see
when
i
was
a
little
girl
i
used
often
to
play
in
and
out
of
old
crittenden
house
and
mill
i
never
seen
anything
since
in
all
my
life
that
seemed
as
wonderful
and
mighty
to
me
as
the
way
the
saw
used
to
gnash
its
teeth
at
the
great
logs
and
slowly
shriekingly
tear
them
apart
into
boards
did
you
use
to
love
the
moss
on
the
old
too
i
never
saw
the
mill
or
the
house
he
told
her
i
never
saw
my
but
once
or
twice
in
my
life
he
was
too
amazed
to
do
anything
but
answer
her
literally
and
baldly
why
how
in
the
world
she
began
to
ask
and
then
as
a
bell
from
one
of
the
innumerable
church
belfries
outside
began
clangorously
to
strike
the
hour
she
glanced
at
her
and
shook
her
head
it
she
said
she
nodded
smiled
and
turned
away
stepping
down
the
corridor
with
a
light
supple
gait
neale
had
never
seen
any
one
walk
like
that
as
though
every
step
were
in
time
to
music
he
went
back
to
his
room
to
wash
his
hands
and
brush
his
clothes
which
showed
signs
of
contact
with
dusty
roman
walls
and
roofs
when
ten
minutes
later
he
went
into
the
five
or
six
people
were
already
at
table
livingstone
among
them
miss
oldham
the
head
of
the
pension
introduced
the
newcomer
to
the
others
mentioning
names
on
both
sides
to
neale
surprise
miss
allen
did
not
explain
as
he
had
opened
his
mouth
to
do
that
she
had
already
seen
and
talked
to
crittenden
that
morning
instead
she
now
gave
him
the
conventional
smile
he
had
expected
ten
minutes
before
accepted
the
introduction
as
though
she
had
never
seen
his
face
and
went
on
drinking
her
more
arabian
nights
what
did
mean
neale
swallowed
the
reference
he
had
begun
to
their
earlier
meeting
miss
oldham
said
to
him
with
the
wearily
playful
accent
of
the
conscientious
fostering
cheerful
talk
around
her
table
i
understand
crittenden
that
you
and
miss
allen
are
in
a
way
related
as
i
might
say
livingstone
joined
in
with
his
usual
sprightliness
yes
crittenden
why
did
you
tell
me
you
had
a
in
rome
last
evening
when
i
went
back
into
the
salon
and
told
the
assembled
company
about
you
and
your
inheritance
there
was
mademoiselle
allaine
who
had
often
in
her
remote
childhood
climbed
on
the
respected
knees
of
monsieur
your
miss
allen
smiled
quietly
over
her
cup
remarked
that
it
would
have
taken
a
bolder
child
than
she
had
ever
been
to
climb
on
the
knees
of
old
crittenden
and
looking
at
her
watch
rose
to
go
music
divine
music
inquired
livingstone
yes
divine
music
she
answered
lightly
we
are
getting
ready
to
play
at
a
soirée
at
donna
antonia
pierleoni
i
due
there
at
half
past
nine
to
try
out
the
piano
in
a
new
position
in
the
room
clear
out
there
by
nine
cried
livingstone
as
if
exhausted
by
the
idea
she
did
not
seem
to
consider
that
this
required
any
answer
made
a
graceful
inclination
of
the
head
to
the
company
at
table
and
went
off
neale
was
repeating
to
himself
in
mortal
terror
of
forgetting
it
pierleoni
pierleoni
he
drank
his
coffee
and
ate
his
roll
as
though
he
had
a
train
to
catch
and
rushing
back
to
his
room
seized
his
hat
and
made
off
to
the
nearest
café
to
consult
the
directory
with
a
sigh
of
relief
he
found
that
there
was
only
one
pierleoni
and
that
the
address
was
indeed
as
livingstone
had
said
far
away
in
the
rich
new
fashionable
quarter
he
set
off
on
foot
but
before
he
had
walked
five
minutes
he
was
overcome
with
panic
lest
he
be
late
and
hailed
a
rickety
cab
thinking
of
nothing
but
the
precious
address
which
he
had
committed
to
memory
he
shouted
it
out
to
the
cabman
there
he
suddenly
remembered
that
he
had
no
possible
business
at
that
address
he
had
a
horrid
vision
of
driving
up
to
the
door
having
the
ask
him
his
errand
perhaps
of
having
miss
allen
look
out
of
the
window
and
see
the
scene
this
threw
him
into
such
a
fright
that
for
an
instant
he
could
think
of
no
escape
and
sat
passive
borne
along
to
his
fate
by
the
unconscious
cabman
then
his
wits
came
back
to
him
he
called
out
to
the
cabman
to
drive
to
number
and
not
a
hundred
and
twenty
and
having
thus
snatched
himself
from
destruction
perceived
that
they
were
even
then
turning
into
the
street
at
number
he
descended
hastily
paid
the
driver
a
good
deal
more
than
was
due
him
stepped
into
the
house
inquired
if
a
gentleman
by
the
name
of
robinson
lived
there
professed
surprise
and
regret
on
hearing
that
he
did
not
and
walked
on
settling
his
necktie
nervously
he
told
himself
that
he
was
acting
like
an
imbecile
but
he
could
not
seem
to
consider
that
important
fact
seriously
having
started
in
to
do
anything
naturally
he
liked
to
put
it
through
everybody
did
and
he
really
would
like
to
know
how
under
the
sun
a
girl
in
rome
happened
to
know
anything
about
his
burton
any
one
would
feel
a
natural
human
curiosity
on
that
score
and
he
had
only
five
days
in
rome
the
idea
that
he
had
only
five
days
in
rome
fell
on
him
like
a
thunderbolt
as
though
he
had
had
no
idea
of
it
till
that
moment
had
he
said
he
had
only
five
days
in
rome
he
walked
along
looking
up
at
the
green
waves
of
feathery
foliage
which
foamed
down
over
the
walls
from
the
verdure
of
the
gardens
inside
what
a
beautiful
spot
rome
was
he
had
not
begun
to
appreciate
it
on
his
last
visit
it
was
wonderful
such
light
he
had
never
seen
such
sunlight
anywhere
ah
here
was
number
a
hundred
and
twenty
a
fine
great
doorway
in
the
wall
with
a
gleaming
brass
plate
marked
pierleoni
at
which
neale
looked
with
pleasure
he
walked
on
some
distance
as
far
as
he
could
go
and
keep
the
house
in
view
and
crossing
over
walked
slowly
back
he
was
not
now
in
the
least
ashamed
of
his
conduct
by
this
time
it
seemed
quite
natural
and
suitable
to
him
just
what
any
one
would
have
done
in
his
place
of
course
he
wanted
to
know
about
his
who
would
not
he
had
made
the
trip
to
the
end
of
the
street
and
back
perhaps
a
dozen
times
his
pulse
beating
more
and
more
quickly
when
from
a
distance
he
saw
a
little
door
beside
the
great
one
open
and
a
tall
girl
in
a
familiar
light
gray
step
out
but
she
was
not
alone
beside
her
walked
a
man
a
tall
stooped
old
man
with
a
black
coat
and
a
black
felt
hat
the
girl
hand
was
on
his
arm
neale
felt
as
astonished
and
grieved
as
though
he
had
caught
his
best
friend
cheating
him
at
cards
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
she
might
not
be
alone
and
yet
he
now
remembered
that
she
had
said
we
he
walked
along
behind
them
at
a
considerable
distance
feeling
for
the
first
time
rather
foolish
a
sensation
which
instantly
took
wings
as
he
saw
them
after
turning
into
another
street
stop
at
a
door
in
the
wall
and
ring
perhaps
she
was
going
to
leave
him
there
neale
gave
a
great
start
forward
but
perhaps
she
was
going
in
with
him
he
halted
where
he
stood
feeling
very
sick
of
himself
and
angrily
resolving
to
turn
his
back
on
them
and
go
off
about
his
business
he
had
never
played
the
born
fool
so
in
his
life
but
he
did
not
turn
his
back
on
them
he
stood
observing
them
while
they
went
through
a
which
seemed
to
him
very
formal
and
and
when
the
old
man
went
in
and
the
infernal
gate
actually
shut
behind
him
neale
started
forward
with
a
bound
but
he
reflected
at
once
that
it
was
too
absurd
to
meet
her
here
in
a
quarter
of
rome
where
no
business
of
his
could
possibly
have
brought
him
at
that
hour
the
cautious
adroit
thing
to
do
was
to
walk
along
behind
her
at
a
distance
till
she
had
turned
into
a
thoroughfare
with
shops
where
he
might
conceivably
be
strolling
while
he
was
making
this
sagacious
plan
his
feet
bore
him
rapidly
up
beside
her
where
he
took
off
his
hat
and
said
good
morning
miss
allen
with
a
wide
smile
of
satisfaction
which
he
knew
must
look
nothing
less
than
imbecile
well
he
had
done
what
he
had
set
out
to
do
she
gave
him
a
good
morning
crittenden
that
showed
no
surprise
and
with
great
tact
began
the
talk
on
the
only
basis
which
gave
him
a
reasonable
claim
on
her
time
you
want
to
hear
how
somebody
in
rome
knows
about
your
burton
do
you
i
afraid
it
like
so
many
other
things
that
sound
mysterious
and
interesting
it
will
only
be
quite
flat
and
commonplace
when
you
really
know
it
is
no
more
than
this
when
i
was
a
little
girl
in
america
and
then
later
when
i
was
in
college
for
a
couple
of
years
i
was
sent
to
spend
my
summers
in
ashley
visiting
an
old
cousin
of
my
father
she
looked
at
him
from
under
her
blue
hat
with
a
air
one
eyebrow
raised
whimsically
and
made
a
little
apologetic
gesture
with
her
shoulders
that
all
she
said
smiling
and
shaking
her
head
oh
it
not
all
neale
cried
to
himself
with
intense
conviction
aloud
he
said
but
i
want
to
hear
more
about
what
kind
of
a
place
it
is
you
see
to
tell
the
truth
i
forgotten
that
i
had
any
burton
and
i
never
was
in
ashley
think
of
being
in
florence
and
getting
a
letter
saying
that
a
in
vermont
has
suddenly
become
yours
i
should
call
it
a
most
nice
sort
of
surprise
remarked
the
girl
with
a
quaintly
turn
of
phrase
which
he
had
already
noticed
and
thought
the
most
delightful
thing
in
the
world
and
i
on
my
way
back
to
america
now
to
see
about
it
what
does
that
mean
to
about
it
she
inquired
oh
sell
it
of
course
she
was
horrified
it
to
whom
oh
to
anybody
who
buy
it
sell
that
darling
old
house
and
those
glorious
elms
sell
that
beautiful
door
with
the
cool
white
marble
steps
leading
up
to
it
and
the
big
and
the
syringas
and
that
cold
pure
that
runs
all
day
and
all
night
in
the
wooden
trough
sell
that
home
and
to
anybody
she
paused
where
she
was
looking
at
him
out
of
wide
shocked
eyes
neale
was
profoundly
thankful
for
anything
that
would
make
her
look
straight
at
him
like
that
but
you
see
he
told
her
i
had
the
least
idea
about
that
darling
old
house
or
the
elms
or
the
or
anything
i
never
heard
a
word
about
it
till
this
minute
i
think
the
only
thing
is
for
you
to
start
in
and
tell
me
everything
as
she
hesitated
professing
with
an
outward
opening
of
her
palms
that
she
really
did
know
exactly
where
to
begin
he
prompted
her
well
begin
at
the
beginning
how
in
the
world
do
you
get
there
oh
if
you
want
to
know
from
the
beginning
she
told
him
i
must
tell
you
at
once
that
you
change
cars
at
hoosick
junction
always
always
no
matter
from
which
direction
you
approach
you
must
change
cars
at
hoosick
junction
and
wait
an
hour
or
so
there
seeing
on
his
face
a
rather
strange
expression
she
feared
that
he
had
lost
the
point
of
her
little
pleasantry
and
inquired
but
perhaps
it
is
that
you
do
not
know
hoosick
junction
oh
yes
i
know
hoosick
junction
all
right
he
said
it
with
a
long
breath
of
wonder
changed
cars
at
hoosick
junction
to
get
here
eh
bien
and
then
a
train
finally
takes
you
from
hoosick
junction
you
sit
pressing
your
little
nose
against
the
window
waiting
to
see
the
mountains
and
when
the
first
one
heaves
up
softly
all
blue
against
the
horizon
you
feel
a
happy
ache
in
your
throat
and
you
look
harder
than
ever
and
by
and
by
some
one
calls
out
you
know
he
means
ashley
and
you
take
your
little
satchel
and
stumble
down
the
aisle
and
the
conductor
lifts
you
down
the
steps
and
there
is
dear
old
cousin
hetty
with
her
wrinkled
face
shining
on
you
she
only
gives
you
a
dry
little
peck
on
your
lips
quick
and
hard
and
says
marise
you
got
here
i
see
but
you
feel
all
over
you
how
glad
she
is
to
see
you
and
you
hug
her
a
great
deal
till
she
says
there
but
you
know
she
likes
it
very
much
she
was
talking
as
she
walked
as
if
her
words
were
set
to
music
her
voice
all
little
ripples
and
bright
upward
and
downward
swoops
like
swallows
flying
her
hands
and
arms
and
shoulders
and
eyebrows
acting
a
delicate
pantomime
of
illustration
the
pale
pure
olive
of
her
face
flushed
slightly
with
her
animation
every
time
she
flashed
a
quick
look
up
at
him
to
make
sure
he
was
not
bored
neale
caught
his
breath
he
felt
as
though
he
were
drinking
the
strongest
kind
of
wine
he
had
the
feeling
of
a
man
who
knows
he
is
going
to
get
very
drunk
and
has
little
idea
of
what
will
happen
when
he
does
yes
and
then
and
then
he
prompted
her
eagerly
well
and
then
you
get
into
a
phaeton
oh
i
do
suppose
you
have
ever
seen
a
phaeton
yes
i
have
he
contradicted
her
i
driven
my
grandfather
miles
in
one
when
i
was
a
little
boy
oh
you
then
about
this
sort
of
you
have
perhaps
lived
in
a
place
like
ashley
she
was
as
eager
as
though
it
had
been
a
question
of
finding
that
they
were
of
the
same
family
i
spent
all
my
summers
in
west
adams
not
so
very
far
from
vermont
ah
then
you
can
understand
what
i
tell
you
she
said
with
satisfaction
and
in
the
phaeton
you
jog
through
the
village
past
the
church
under
the
elms
with
the
white
houses
each
under
its
thick
green
trees
and
such
green
green
grass
everywhere
not
like
italy
all
brown
and
parched
and
then
down
the
road
till
the
for
crittenden
for
you
see
i
also
go
to
crittenden
my
cousin
home
is
one
of
the
three
or
four
houses
that
stand
around
your
house
and
mill
and
so
up
the
road
to
crittenden
between
the
mountains
closer
and
higher
up
into
the
quiet
valley
her
voice
deepened
on
the
last
words
and
so
did
her
eyes
she
was
silent
a
moment
looking
out
unseeingly
on
the
tropical
palms
and
bright
huge
flowers
of
the
pincian
gardens
through
which
they
were
now
walking
eh
bien
since
it
you
who
are
going
home
you
drive
on
a
little
farther
than
my
cousin
hetty
house
until
up
before
you
slopes
a
lovely
meadow
smooth
bright
shining
green
like
the
enamel
green
field
in
the
limbo
where
dante
puts
electra
and
hector
and
cæsar
at
the
top
of
the
slope
a
long
line
of
splendid
splendid
elms
like
this
you
know
with
her
two
hands
and
a
free
upward
gesture
of
her
arms
she
showed
the
airy
of
the
wineglass
elms
and
back
of
them
a
long
old
house
ever
so
long
because
everything
is
fastened
along
together
house
porch
woodshed
she
laughed
at
the
recollection
turning
to
him
you
seen
those
long
new
england
i
remember
a
city
man
said
once
that
you
could
see
the
head
of
the
lady
of
the
house
leaning
from
one
window
and
the
head
of
a
cow
from
another
he
thought
that
the
most
crushing
thing
that
could
be
said
but
think
those
homes
perfectly
delightful
homely
with
a
of
their
own
not
copied
from
houses
in
other
countries
and
really
you
know
she
turned
serious
thinking
suddenly
that
perhaps
he
needed
reassurance
really
it
just
as
as
any
other
way
of
living
you
just
as
far
away
from
the
animals
as
with
any
other
barn
because
you
have
so
much
woodshed
and
and
things
between
you
to
see
her
face
with
that
quite
new
housekeeping
practical
look
gave
him
the
most
absurd
and
illogical
amusement
he
laughed
outright
oh
do
think
for
a
moment
that
i
would
object
he
cried
gaily
i
not
a
bit
fastidious
i
would
care
near
the
cows
were
if
they
were
nice
cows
she
thought
for
an
instant
he
might
be
laughing
at
her
and
peered
keenly
into
his
face
a
more
openly
observing
look
than
she
had
as
yet
given
him
what
she
saw
evidently
reassured
her
for
she
went
on
with
a
lighter
tone
truly
it
has
its
own
sort
of
architectural
beauty
it
does
have
a
bit
of
the
look
that
most
have
no
matter
how
they
planned
it
seems
to
have
grown
that
way
the
long
low
old
weathered
so
beautifully
it
looks
like
an
outcrop
of
the
very
earth
itself
like
a
ridge
or
rock
or
a
fold
in
a
field
it
was
about
at
this
time
that
neale
began
to
lose
the
capacity
of
listening
to
what
she
was
saying
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
he
could
not
keep
his
mind
on
it
he
found
that
he
felt
a
giddy
dazzled
uncertainty
of
where
he
was
putting
his
feet
and
tried
to
pull
himself
together
he
must
really
notice
a
little
more
what
he
was
about
her
quick
rising
and
falling
articulate
speech
her
quick
flashing
changes
of
expression
the
play
of
her
flexible
hands
and
shoulders
no
how
could
he
listen
to
what
she
was
saying
but
she
was
asking
him
a
question
now
she
was
saying
you
not
really
going
to
all
that
to
just
but
really
he
answered
helplessly
honest
it
sounds
wonderful
as
you
tell
it
but
what
could
do
with
it
i
could
very
well
go
to
in
ashley
vermont
could
i
why
not
she
asked
a
good
many
people
have
well
but
he
began
incapable
of
forming
any
answer
incapable
of
thinking
of
anything
but
the
dark
softness
of
her
gaze
on
him
what
was
it
they
were
talking
about
oh
yes
about
selling
out
at
ashley
oh
but
i
have
other
plans
i
am
just
about
to
go
to
china
why
to
china
neale
lost
his
head
entirely
notice
more
what
he
was
about
he
had
not
the
least
idea
what
he
was
about
he
said
to
her
rather
wildly
i
hardly
know
myself
why
i
am
going
to
china
i
like
if
you
will
let
me
i
like
ever
so
much
to
tell
you
about
it
and
see
what
you
think
you
know
about
ashley
do
you
see
he
was
aware
that
the
last
of
what
he
had
said
had
no
shadow
of
connection
with
the
first
but
that
seemed
of
no
importance
whatever
to
him
they
were
standing
now
near
a
low
wall
under
some
thick
dark
ilex
trees
a
fountain
dripping
musically
before
them
mechanically
they
sat
down
looking
earnestly
at
each
other
you
see
began
neale
trying
to
find
my
way
i
was
in
business
in
the
states
and
getting
along
all
right
on
i
mean
as
they
say
and
then
i
got
to
wondering
it
seemed
as
though
as
though
i
was
sure
it
was
what
i
wanted
to
do
with
my
life
just
to
buy
low
and
sell
high
all
my
life
long
perhaps
there
was
more
to
it
than
i
could
make
out
it
certainly
seemed
to
suit
a
lot
of
folks
fine
but
i
could
seem
to
see
it
i
was
all
right
nothing
the
matter
only
i
could
why
i
tell
you
i
felt
like
a
perfectly
good
torch
that
would
catch
on
fire
i
could
seem
to
enough
about
it
to
make
it
worth
while
to
really
tear
in
and
do
it
and
i
thought
maybe
if
i
got
off
a
little
way
from
it
sometimes
you
do
see
the
sense
of
things
better
that
way
so
i
went
away
i
took
a
year
off
i
saved
a
little
money
enough
for
that
and
i
been
trying
to
figure
something
out
of
course
i
been
enjoying
the
traveling
around
too
perhaps
that
the
real
reason
why
i
want
to
go
to
china
just
to
keep
going
see
new
things
get
away
keep
free
but
i
think
about
the
other
a
good
deal
what
can
i
do
with
my
life
that
sort
of
you
know
if
only
in
a
very
small
way
i
a
very
ordinary
man
no
gifts
no
talents
but
i
have
lots
of
energy
and
health
it
seems
as
though
there
ought
to
be
does
it
he
had
stumbled
on
breathlessly
involuntarily
hardly
aware
that
he
was
speaking
at
all
aware
only
that
she
was
listening
with
her
head
bent
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
the
pure
pale
olive
of
her
face
like
a
pearl
in
the
shadow
of
her
hat
she
was
listening
intently
he
knew
as
he
had
never
known
anything
else
that
she
was
listening
to
what
he
really
meant
not
to
what
he
was
saying
in
those
poor
plain
broken
words
and
yet
how
could
he
go
on
the
sudden
plunge
he
had
made
deep
into
an
element
new
to
him
the
utter
strangeness
of
his
having
thus
spoken
out
what
he
had
before
but
shyly
glanced
at
the
awfulness
of
having
opened
his
heart
to
the
day
his
shut
shut
heart
good
god
what
was
he
doing
at
his
silence
she
raised
her
face
towards
him
to
his
amazement
her
eyes
were
shining
wet
with
tears
and
yet
there
was
no
sadness
in
her
face
she
was
smiling
at
him
a
wavering
misty
smile
she
stood
up
made
a
little
flexible
eloquent
gesture
with
her
hands
and
arms
and
shoulders
as
if
to
explain
to
him
that
she
could
not
trust
herself
to
speak
and
still
smiling
at
him
the
tears
still
in
her
eyes
walked
rapidly
away
chapter
xliv
after
dinner
that
evening
miss
allen
came
up
to
where
livingstone
and
crittenden
stood
together
near
the
window
and
said
to
them
would
it
interest
you
at
all
to
go
to
the
soirée
at
donna
she
has
been
kind
enough
to
offer
me
some
cards
of
invitation
and
it
occurred
to
me
if
you
have
anything
better
to
do
that
evening
livingstone
carried
one
hand
to
his
heart
the
other
to
his
brow
and
professed
inability
to
recover
from
the
shock
my
dear
young
lady
inhuman
to
shatter
my
nerves
with
a
like
that
without
a
word
of
warning
you
know
well
enough
i
gladly
give
one
of
my
ears
for
an
invitation
to
donna
antonia
why
then
the
false
modesty
as
who
should
say
you
nothing
more
interesting
on
hand
just
step
up
and
let
me
make
you
a
duke
do
miss
allen
acknowledged
the
facetious
intention
of
this
with
a
suitable
laugh
and
looked
at
neale
he
said
oh
of
course
i
shall
be
glad
to
go
that
good
then
i
shall
hope
to
see
both
of
you
when
she
had
turned
away
to
another
group
in
the
salon
livingstone
put
his
head
on
one
side
and
smiled
down
at
his
cigarette
that
what
comes
of
a
little
judicious
attention
bestowed
in
the
right
direction
he
informed
neale
i
been
getting
up
at
the
unearthly
hour
that
girl
takes
her
breakfast
for
a
fortnight
now
quite
a
charmer
she
though
nothing
to
her
friend
miss
mills
it
miss
mills
interested
in
just
wait
till
you
see
joint
production
of
american
cash
and
european
civilization
hair
like
gold
thread
and
scads
of
money
in
her
own
right
he
added
seriously
miss
allen
has
you
know
money
i
mean
too
bad
is
it
her
father
is
only
a
salaried
man
something
or
other
for
paris
for
the
something
or
other
company
oh
no
i
believe
it
mowing
machines
or
maybe
twist
drills
anyhow
one
of
those
missionaries
from
our
own
little
of
cogs
and
gears
but
of
course
the
fair
allaine
may
make
a
lot
herself
if
she
really
does
get
on
the
concert
stage
still
you
never
can
tell
there
an
awful
lot
of
interior
to
be
done
managers
and
musical
critics
and
so
on
before
anybody
really
is
allowed
to
get
to
the
bacon
in
the
concert
business
and
is
she
really
anywhere
near
professional
skill
who
knows
however
a
pretty
girl
always
stands
enough
sight
better
show
than
a
plain
one
or
than
a
man
if
she
uses
those
dark
eyes
of
hers
to
good
account
i
should
think
any
manager
or
music
critic
would
fall
for
her
has
a
good
skin
too
quite
pleasant
that
clear
olive
though
of
course
it
awfully
common
here
in
italy
just
the
same
a
dark
woman
never
has
the
of
a
blonde
wait
till
you
see
miss
mills
neale
broke
in
on
his
flow
to
remark
in
a
suffocated
voice
that
he
had
letters
to
write
and
disappeared
the
soirée
was
horrible
to
neale
a
nightmare
a
glittering
wall
through
which
he
could
by
no
means
break
to
reach
her
over
which
he
could
scarcely
see
at
an
immense
distance
her
slim
figure
dressed
in
yellow
a
thin
gold
fillet
binding
her
smooth
dark
head
she
was
talking
smiling
animated
at
ease
and
after
she
had
played
much
acclaimed
there
was
nothing
surprising
about
thought
neale
applauding
with
all
his
might
heavens
how
beautifully
she
made
music
how
beautifully
how
intelligently
with
such
a
clear
sure
certainty
of
her
own
powers
of
course
everybody
there
admired
her
paid
court
to
her
made
her
the
center
of
one
group
after
another
always
except
the
group
where
he
stood
he
felt
to
be
so
cut
off
from
her
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
not
in
the
least
literally
cut
off
from
her
she
kept
relentlessly
introducing
him
to
one
person
after
another
whom
he
did
not
wish
to
meet
she
kept
coming
up
to
him
every
time
he
had
succeeded
in
shaking
off
a
tiresome
companion
and
was
standing
alone
at
last
in
a
corner
looking
everywhere
over
the
curled
powdered
bobbing
restless
grinning
crowd
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
there
she
would
be
at
his
elbow
gliding
up
from
nowhere
he
restrained
an
impulse
to
snatch
at
her
and
hold
her
there
because
each
time
she
melted
away
after
she
had
said
wo
you
let
me
take
you
to
donna
antonia
pierleoni
or
to
miss
mills
or
to
signor
ambrogi
or
to
somebody
or
other
with
whom
it
was
necessary
to
talk
and
on
whom
it
was
necessary
to
try
to
keep
those
wandering
seeking
eyes
of
his
he
took
them
in
with
the
of
his
consciousness
one
after
another
of
the
people
with
whom
he
was
forced
to
talk
donna
antonia
pierleoni
a
haughty
elderly
roman
lady
who
was
as
neale
said
to
himself
feeding
her
haughty
roman
face
as
though
she
scorned
and
despised
lemon
ice
but
eat
it
since
it
seemed
to
be
her
duty
it
amused
him
greatly
to
observe
that
after
finishing
one
she
took
another
at
once
miss
mills
oh
yes
this
must
be
the
girl
livingstone
had
been
yarning
about
of
course
after
praise
from
livingstone
it
was
to
be
expected
that
she
look
like
a
very
wax
image
in
a
window
and
yet
neale
attention
was
caught
for
a
moment
by
her
pronunciation
of
a
french
phrase
her
inflection
reminded
him
of
marise
allen
and
he
hung
about
her
for
some
time
in
the
hope
of
hearing
it
again
every
time
she
repeated
it
which
she
often
did
he
smiled
down
broadly
on
her
she
was
a
pretty
little
thing
livingstone
was
right
she
was
really
quite
an
object
of
art
if
that
was
what
you
called
them
signor
ambrogi
turned
out
to
be
in
politics
an
assistant
minister
of
commerce
or
industry
or
something
why
he
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
new
york
business
man
might
be
old
man
gates
as
he
had
been
at
as
they
tried
to
talk
to
each
other
in
french
that
was
not
very
fluent
on
either
side
neale
was
reflecting
that
the
roman
governing
type
had
changed
very
little
this
head
with
its
thick
hooked
nose
bold
eyes
hard
mouth
and
wrinkled
forehead
could
be
put
without
change
in
among
the
portraits
of
roman
emperors
they
talked
in
their
halting
lingua
franca
of
business
of
railroads
of
the
use
of
commercial
fertilizers
on
italian
fields
of
the
conversion
of
into
electrical
energy
and
finding
neale
a
good
listener
the
italian
told
him
about
a
in
a
volcanic
region
of
italy
that
ran
its
machinery
by
the
steam
escaping
from
the
thin
crust
of
earth
over
internal
volcanic
for
an
instant
neale
was
quite
stirred
by
this
conception
it
seemed
a
very
neat
idea
and
it
tickled
him
to
have
italians
turn
such
a
traditionally
american
trick
pretty
good
pretty
good
he
said
applaudingly
that
beating
us
at
our
own
game
pas
si
bête
en
effet
said
the
other
well
pleased
by
comment
but
this
interlude
was
the
only
time
when
even
for
a
moment
neale
was
delivered
from
his
desolation
at
seeing
her
so
far
from
his
world
from
any
world
he
could
possibly
hope
ever
to
make
his
own
that
brilliant
musician
how
wonderful
to
be
able
to
play
the
piano
like
that
that
beautiful
young
woman
of
the
world
the
center
of
this
brilliant
cosmopolitan
crowd
friend
of
titled
roman
ladies
and
ministers
was
it
she
whom
he
had
followed
in
the
street
like
any
pushing
bumpkin
to
whom
he
had
poured
out
what
he
had
never
before
breathed
to
any
living
being
what
on
earth
could
she
think
of
him
for
what
kind
of
a
flamboyant
idiot
did
she
take
him
well
the
best
thing
to
do
great
scott
the
thing
to
do
was
to
shut
up
and
back
out
as
he
walked
home
with
livingstone
at
midnight
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
take
the
first
train
to
naples
the
next
morning
but
he
made
no
move
whatever
to
do
this
when
the
morning
came
dumb
and
stupid
as
a
sheep
he
made
his
way
doggedly
to
the
at
the
earliest
hour
to
see
miss
allen
take
her
as
he
went
in
at
the
door
he
realized
that
his
calculations
were
all
wrong
that
she
had
been
up
late
the
night
before
and
would
certainly
sleep
late
that
morning
but
livingstone
had
already
seen
him
and
hailed
him
it
was
too
late
to
go
back
and
wait
he
sat
down
gloomily
stirred
the
sugar
into
his
coffee
and
listened
to
livingstone
fizz
all
over
the
place
about
the
evening
entertainment
which
had
uplifted
him
to
exaltation
you
do
crittenden
what
an
opportunity
that
was
to
see
exclusive
roman
society
the
kind
that
foreigners
like
us
never
meet
not
the
flashy
crowd
why
i
was
introduced
to
name
after
name
that
sounded
like
a
page
out
of
roman
history
neale
thought
with
a
passing
grim
irony
that
livingstone
phrase
was
accurately
turned
introduced
to
names
yea
verily
well
names
were
what
livingstone
was
after
oh
you
up
already
miss
allen
said
livingstone
springing
to
seat
her
with
an
agility
for
which
neale
hated
him
he
himself
sat
like
a
lump
incapable
because
of
the
sudden
rush
of
blood
to
his
head
of
anything
but
nodding
a
silent
answer
to
her
greeting
livingstone
needed
no
help
in
keeping
up
the
conversation
he
flowed
on
delightedly
passing
in
review
every
detail
of
the
evening
of
which
he
had
not
missed
a
single
one
apparently
from
the
way
donna
maid
did
her
hair
to
the
dandruff
on
the
of
the
old
visconti
of
course
i
know
he
a
great
musician
and
all
that
but
really
if
you
will
let
your
hair
grow
so
long
you
ought
to
have
a
pocket
and
it
ought
you
why
do
you
do
it
for
him
miss
allen
every
one
says
he
is
absolutely
gone
on
you
that
you
could
do
anything
with
him
he
passed
from
this
without
transition
to
miss
mills
toilette
which
had
been
so
it
seemed
a
veritable
triumph
yes
yes
was
it
beautiful
eugenia
clothes
are
simply
wonderful
miss
allen
broke
in
to
say
enthusiastically
she
has
the
most
taste
a
corrected
livingstone
you
do
get
far
with
mere
taste
ce
bas
miss
allen
finished
her
coffee
and
setting
down
her
cup
remarked
you
two
americans
seem
to
have
made
a
most
agreeable
impression
last
evening
donna
antonia
called
me
back
to
say
that
signor
ambrogi
would
be
glad
to
see
more
of
you
she
wished
me
to
ask
you
both
if
you
could
come
to
have
tea
with
her
and
with
signor
ambrogi
this
afternoon
at
five
livingstone
fell
back
in
his
chair
dramatically
the
long
struggle
is
over
crittenden
our
fortunes
are
made
he
cried
with
his
usual
facetiousness
but
by
the
expression
on
his
face
he
was
really
moved
and
dazzled
kindly
convey
to
donna
antonia
pierleoni
the
assurance
of
our
condescending
regards
and
say
that
if
we
can
spare
the
time
from
the
press
of
other
more
important
duties
neale
said
plainly
and
bluntly
i
afraid
i
better
excuse
myself
i
have
a
previous
engagement
the
other
two
turned
on
him
with
faces
of
astonishment
you
not
cried
livingstone
appalled
why
should
i
break
an
engagement
said
neale
why
you
livingstone
gaped
at
him
only
the
trifling
insignificant
reason
that
donna
antonia
is
one
of
the
greatest
in
rome
and
ambrogi
one
of
coming
men
in
the
government
has
that
anything
to
do
with
me
neale
asked
with
the
sincerest
incapacity
to
imagine
any
reason
why
it
should
he
was
stricken
with
anticipatory
boredom
at
the
idea
of
having
to
make
talk
again
with
that
disagreeable
old
woman
livingstone
wondered
if
crittenden
had
really
understood
from
whom
the
invitation
came
do
you
remember
meeting
her
the
one
with
the
wonderfully
type
oh
i
remember
her
all
right
the
old
lady
with
the
predatory
sharpness
of
beak
and
claw
that
called
aristocratic
said
neale
trying
to
get
a
rise
out
of
livingstone
that
was
usually
easy
enough
but
he
was
now
too
genuinely
concerned
to
defend
his
standards
now
crittenden
he
said
laying
down
his
napkin
and
speaking
from
his
heart
to
seem
not
to
wish
to
continue
the
acquaintance
of
a
lady
who
makes
a
civil
advance
it
simply
oh
go
on
said
neale
laughing
at
the
idea
much
she
care
what
an
impecunious
american
in
a
pension
does
or
does
do
livingstone
had
recovered
himself
enough
to
reflect
that
neale
refusal
would
not
at
all
hinder
his
own
acceptance
in
fact
on
the
contrary
well
well
no
matter
he
said
with
a
change
of
manner
perhaps
you
right
without
a
knowledge
of
the
language
conversation
in
a
small
group
rather
five
did
you
say
miss
allen
yes
five
she
answered
she
went
on
with
a
manner
suddenly
gay
perceive
the
difference
in
human
fate
at
five
you
will
be
taking
tea
with
personages
and
i
shall
be
scurrying
to
take
a
belated
music
lesson
why
at
hour
inquired
livingstone
i
put
it
off
to
help
eugenia
get
settled
here
for
she
coming
over
bag
and
baggage
joséphine
and
mlle
tollet
to
live
with
us
for
a
while
is
that
jolly
livingstone
was
visibly
affected
he
flushed
a
little
and
cleared
his
throat
before
he
asked
with
a
careful
reassumption
of
his
usual
airy
manner
might
i
perhaps
if
it
is
not
indiscreet
to
ask
be
permitted
to
breathe
out
upon
the
air
a
request
to
be
informed
what
possible
reason
any
one
can
have
for
leaving
the
golden
if
i
may
so
express
myself
of
the
grand
hotel
and
sojourning
at
the
respectable
but
hardly
luxurious
pensione
oldham
that
what
i
asked
her
last
night
when
she
told
me
but
it
seems
just
tired
of
gilded
if
i
may
borrow
the
expression
and
wants
a
change
i
might
say
without
exaggeration
that
she
would
be
reasonably
sure
of
getting
it
surmised
livingstone
looking
around
him
neale
could
think
of
nothing
to
add
to
the
conversation
you
never
could
get
a
word
in
edgeways
when
livingstone
was
in
the
room
anyhow
his
mind
was
full
of
something
else
too
a
music
lesson
at
five
the
name
visconti
was
as
apt
to
be
in
the
directory
as
pierleoni
had
been
at
five
he
saw
her
go
into
the
little
gate
in
the
wall
from
which
during
the
next
hour
he
did
not
take
his
eyes
he
stood
in
the
doorway
of
an
apartment
house
across
the
street
and
when
the
came
out
responsibly
to
ask
whom
he
wished
to
see
neale
told
him
in
english
seriously
with
a
long
breath
the
girl
i
lost
my
head
over
as
he
accompanied
this
unintelligible
information
with
a
large
tip
as
his
clothes
were
respectable
as
he
was
evidently
a
foreigner
and
had
moreover
a
rather
strange
spark
of
excitement
in
his
eyes
the
pocketed
the
tip
looked
with
respect
at
neale
powerful
proportions
and
went
discreetly
back
to
his
own
affairs
when
she
came
out
at
six
neale
was
struck
speechless
he
had
spent
the
entire
hour
thinking
how
she
looked
remembering
every
detail
of
her
beauty
and
yet
it
was
as
though
he
saw
for
the
first
time
that
noble
carriage
of
her
head
and
shoulders
that
curve
of
her
long
fine
brows
the
smooth
pale
oval
of
her
face
the
touching
wistfulness
the
look
in
her
dark
eyes
that
was
before
she
saw
him
when
he
came
up
to
her
she
broke
at
once
into
a
laugh
her
face
sparkling
and
merry
a
delicate
malice
in
the
mobile
lines
of
her
red
lips
oh
crittenden
i
been
wanting
to
see
you
to
share
a
joke
with
you
such
a
joke
that
invitation
to
tea
you
know
you
see
were
really
the
one
signor
ambrogi
wants
to
see
you
were
the
only
one
donna
antonia
spoke
of
but
i
knew
it
would
hurt
livingstone
so
if
he
were
left
out
i
made
her
understand
that
so
she
said
well
if
you
insist
he
can
come
too
it
rather
do
you
think
it
is
rather
a
joke
she
began
to
laugh
again
do
you
see
it
the
scene
when
he
walks
in
alone
the
good
livingstone
in
his
best
clothes
so
happy
and
so
important
with
his
best
brand
of
european
conversation
in
the
a
comparison
most
likely
of
caravaggio
theory
of
treating
wall
spaces
with
correggio
and
what
ambrogi
wants
to
discuss
is
american
railroad
terminal
facilities
ambrogi
is
a
man
of
the
people
he
made
his
own
way
up
from
the
bottom
he
has
probably
never
heard
of
correggio
in
his
life
and
does
see
why
he
should
she
finished
with
a
peal
of
laughter
neale
laughed
but
he
did
not
find
it
as
comic
as
she
i
no
idea
of
all
that
he
said
uncomfortably
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
gone
it
rather
looks
like
putting
poor
old
livingstone
in
a
hole
oh
no
oh
she
reassured
him
they
be
good
to
him
they
may
look
at
each
other
once
or
twice
but
nothing
more
he
never
know
he
livingstone
often
he
does
know
not
much
that
a
fact
agreed
neale
reflecting
that
he
did
not
seem
to
either
she
asked
him
suddenly
but
really
why
you
accept
do
you
want
to
know
he
asked
warningly
yes
i
really
wonder
simplest
reason
in
the
world
i
did
like
donna
antonia
pierleoni
very
well
she
seemed
to
me
like
a
stupid
old
lady
mightily
full
of
her
own
importance
why
under
the
sun
i
go
and
have
tea
with
such
a
person
eh
bien
she
breathed
out
a
long
soft
ejaculation
of
surprise
looking
at
him
very
queerly
you
thinking
i
very
rude
to
say
such
a
thing
about
a
friend
of
yours
he
said
hanging
his
head
i
thinking
no
such
thing
at
all
she
contradicted
him
i
believe
you
could
what
i
thinking
you
never
said
a
truer
thing
neale
admitted
ruefully
well
i
tell
you
she
said
though
it
could
be
interesting
to
anybody
but
me
i
was
thinking
that
i
had
never
heard
anybody
before
who
spoke
the
truth
right
out
about
somebody
who
had
wealth
and
position
you
must
blame
me
for
it
neale
excused
himself
i
a
regular
outsider
on
all
that
sort
of
thing
you
remember
the
sioux
indian
in
the
eighteenth
century
who
was
taken
to
see
the
court
at
versailles
how
he
strolled
around
in
his
blanket
and
could
make
out
what
all
the
bowing
and
scraping
was
about
well
he
and
i
are
about
on
a
level
of
blank
ignorance
of
social
distinctions
but
you
do
to
know
the
girl
divined
you
do
care
if
you
an
outsider
why
i
believe
she
said
with
a
little
burst
of
astonishment
i
believe
you
rather
be
an
outsider
he
looked
apologetic
that
part
of
my
dumbness
do
you
see
i
just
ca
conceive
why
anybody
should
bother
his
head
about
it
tell
you
he
hit
on
the
right
phrase
of
explanation
i
just
do
know
any
better
would
you
learn
she
pressed
him
more
closely
not
if
i
could
run
faster
than
the
person
who
was
trying
to
teach
me
he
confessed
helplessly
the
girl
broke
into
another
laugh
there
never
was
anybody
who
laughed
like
that
with
her
lips
and
her
gleaming
dancing
eyes
and
her
eyebrows
even
her
hands
had
a
droll
little
gesture
of
delightedly
giving
him
up
what
in
the
world
had
ever
made
him
imagine
that
her
expression
was
pensive
or
her
eyes
wistful
do
you
mind
he
asked
rather
uncertain
what
she
was
laughing
at
and
hoping
it
was
not
at
him
oh
i
it
she
told
him
heartily
but
it
the
very
first
time
i
ever
ran
into
it
it
makes
me
laugh
it
so
unexpected
well
it
has
its
disadvantages
he
broke
in
seeing
an
opening
to
say
something
that
had
been
on
his
conscience
for
two
days
it
makes
you
do
all
sorts
of
unusual
and
unconventional
things
without
meaning
to
at
all
like
my
talking
to
you
yesterday
morning
for
instance
in
the
corridor
of
the
pension
when
i
had
been
introduced
to
you
she
stopped
laughing
her
face
all
blank
with
surprise
why
that
was
not
unconventional
people
at
the
same
pension
never
wait
for
introductions
and
anyhow
i
not
a
fille
du
i
just
a
if
you
only
knew
how
people
try
to
take
advantage
of
that
why
what
in
the
world
made
you
think
it
was
not
all
right
well
when
you
did
say
anything
about
it
at
the
breakfast
table
when
miss
oldham
introduced
us
the
way
you
looked
as
though
you
never
seen
me
before
i
thought
you
i
thought
i
well
why
you
mention
we
just
been
talking
oh
she
remembered
the
incident
why
did
i
why
i
you
always
hide
what
you
do
have
to
tell
do
you
neale
pondered
this
negligent
axiom
for
a
time
and
then
said
hesitatingly
but
if
the
servants
happened
to
mention
it
oh
she
explained
quickly
as
if
mentioning
something
that
went
without
saying
oh
of
course
i
told
the
servants
not
to
speak
of
it
you
did
he
felt
that
he
was
looking
through
what
he
had
always
thought
was
the
opaque
surface
of
things
and
seeing
a
great
deal
more
going
on
there
than
he
had
dreamed
but
can
you
count
on
them
she
continued
to
be
as
surprised
at
his
surprise
as
he
at
the
whole
manoeuver
oh
of
course
you
can
never
count
on
servants
unless
something
in
it
for
them
i
gave
them
a
little
tip
apiece
you
he
could
only
stupidly
repeat
his
exclamation
what
did
they
say
why
they
found
it
perfectly
natural
they
wo
mention
it
not
of
course
unless
somebody
else
tips
them
more
and
i
do
see
why
anybody
should
do
you
neale
stood
looking
at
her
a
little
consternation
mingling
with
his
astonishment
this
was
what
it
was
to
have
been
brought
up
in
what
people
called
a
civilized
way
this
smooth
mastery
of
concealment
how
easy
it
had
been
for
her
at
the
breakfast
table
yesterday
not
to
give
the
faintest
hint
she
had
just
been
talking
animatedly
with
him
and
this
morning
not
the
faintest
hint
to
livingstone
that
she
was
laughing
at
his
expense
why
that
lovely
face
was
just
like
a
mask
you
had
the
least
idea
what
was
going
on
behind
it
there
was
a
silence
she
was
looking
up
at
him
with
a
new
expression
almost
timidly
you
do
like
my
hiding
things
she
asked
him
coming
to
a
stop
they
were
near
the
pension
now
standing
in
the
twilight
on
a
deserted
street
he
aroused
himself
to
shrug
his
shoulders
and
answer
evasively
oh
it
not
in
the
least
any
business
of
mine
but
you
do
like
it
she
insisted
looking
straight
at
him
with
the
deadly
soft
gaze
that
always
made
him
lose
his
head
entirely
it
of
no
consequence
none
he
murmured
but
she
still
looked
at
him
he
tried
to
think
of
some
other
evasive
answer
but
in
the
confusion
of
his
mind
he
could
not
think
at
all
and
he
must
say
with
alarm
with
horror
he
heard
himself
saying
baldly
as
he
would
to
a
man
to
an
intimate
the
literal
truth
well
no
not
so
very
well
if
you
really
want
to
know
it
was
as
though
he
had
seen
himself
swinging
an
ax
at
an
angle
that
would
bring
the
edge
deep
into
his
own
flesh
he
felt
it
cut
deep
and
bleed
he
dared
not
look
at
her
he
wished
to
god
he
had
gone
on
straight
to
naples
somehow
he
looking
at
her
her
face
was
deeply
flushed
she
looked
as
though
he
had
struck
her
in
the
face
well
now
it
was
certainly
all
over
he
might
as
well
turn
around
and
walk
away
and
never
look
at
her
again
he
said
blunderingly
in
a
trembling
voice
i
sorry
i
mean
to
say
that
it
no
business
of
mine
i
awfully
ashamed
of
myself
forget
it
what
do
care
what
i
think
i
nobody
nobody
at
all
why
did
you
say
that
she
asked
him
in
a
low
voice
with
a
driving
intensity
of
accent
as
though
more
than
anything
else
she
must
have
an
answer
from
him
well
you
asked
me
he
said
in
abject
misery
aware
of
the
hideous
flat
futility
of
such
an
answer
if
only
he
were
an
expansive
italian
now
he
could
think
of
some
way
openly
to
abase
himself
instead
of
standing
there
callously
and
dully
oh
please
do
think
of
it
again
he
implored
her
wishing
he
could
get
down
on
his
knees
to
beg
her
pardon
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
put
her
hand
to
her
heart
it
the
first
time
anybody
ever
told
the
truth
to
me
you
see
she
said
faintly
with
a
strange
accent
i
i
like
it
i
think
when
i
can
get
my
breath
to
his
amazement
he
saw
that
she
was
trying
bravely
to
smile
at
him
to
his
greater
amazement
he
snatched
up
both
her
hands
and
carried
them
roughly
and
passionately
to
his
lips
chapter
xlv
during
the
interminable
process
of
hanging
the
skirt
of
that
yellow
dress
for
donna
antonia
soirée
marise
kept
thinking
of
the
pantheon
the
dressmaker
lodging
was
near
there
if
they
could
only
be
done
with
those
draperies
she
would
have
time
to
step
into
the
place
which
she
loved
best
in
rome
she
cast
a
look
at
herself
in
the
cracked
mirror
which
was
all
the
inexpensive
little
dressmaker
could
afford
afraid
it
higher
on
the
right
hip
she
said
and
settled
with
a
sigh
to
endure
more
pinnings
and
unpinnings
strange
how
important
it
is
for
the
correct
playing
of
beethoven
she
thought
ironically
that
the
drapery
on
one
hip
shall
not
be
higher
than
on
the
other
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
herself
as
she
thought
this
and
frowned
to
see
her
lip
curled
in
a
cold
ugly
line
of
distaste
her
thoughts
were
showing
more
and
more
on
her
face
she
knew
well
enough
what
mme
vallery
would
say
she
would
say
do
pretend
dear
child
that
you
do
know
perfectly
well
that
the
kind
of
dress
you
wear
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
everything
that
anybody
cares
about
and
that
the
kind
of
people
you
must
depend
on
to
make
your
music
profitable
are
the
kind
who
care
nothing
about
music
and
altogether
about
looks
that
was
true
of
course
but
all
the
same
it
did
make
marise
sick
to
have
people
call
a
soirée
musicale
what
really
was
a
sartorial
evening
of
course
it
was
understood
that
people
were
hypocritical
about
everything
she
granted
that
they
never
called
anything
by
its
right
name
but
she
did
wish
they
would
leave
music
alone
she
about
that
that
right
now
she
said
aloud
looking
intently
from
one
hip
to
the
other
perhaps
a
more
no
it
will
do
as
it
is
she
would
have
time
for
the
pantheon
after
all
ten
minutes
at
least
ten
minutes
for
the
pantheon
she
had
been
of
an
hour
with
the
dressmaker
that
was
her
life
she
walked
in
through
the
gray
old
portico
and
still
fretting
her
mouth
still
in
the
cold
ugly
line
she
stepped
through
the
huge
bronze
doorway
and
stood
under
the
vault
she
always
forgot
how
it
affected
her
or
she
would
come
in
every
day
as
other
people
said
their
prayers
it
was
as
though
it
had
been
made
for
her
and
had
waited
till
she
came
to
look
at
it
and
find
a
passing
peace
she
lifted
her
face
to
the
huge
open
circle
at
the
center
of
the
dome
high
over
her
head
quiet
strength
came
into
her
heart
from
those
great
gray
stones
century
after
century
they
had
enclosed
that
lovely
circle
of
open
sky
and
sunlit
cloud
and
every
other
ancient
roof
in
rome
had
gone
down
to
heaps
of
rubbish
save
only
this
steadfast
enduring
letting
in
the
innocent
clear
light
of
every
day
down
to
the
heart
of
the
old
temple
daylight
that
was
what
made
the
pantheon
a
place
apart
for
her
honest
daylight
how
cheap
beside
it
was
the
theatrical
yellow
of
the
windows
back
of
the
altar
in
peter
she
looked
about
her
for
a
place
to
sit
and
seeing
no
chair
took
a
and
sank
to
her
knees
on
it
as
though
she
were
praying
she
was
praying
in
her
way
she
continued
to
look
up
at
the
heaped
golden
clouds
at
the
infinite
depth
of
the
blue
blue
sky
at
the
ineffable
clarity
of
the
light
pouring
in
through
the
great
round
opening
it
seemed
to
smile
at
her
an
honest
loving
reassuring
smile
that
flooded
her
vexed
somber
heart
as
it
flooded
the
somber
ancient
building
what
strength
what
strength
in
those
gray
stones
to
hold
together
where
everything
else
had
been
broken
and
dispersed
how
beautiful
primitive
things
were
how
consoling
and
healing
the
hardness
and
strength
of
stones
the
clarity
of
light
the
transparency
of
the
sky
if
you
could
only
somehow
make
your
life
up
of
such
things
strength
sunshine
simplicity
and
music
she
continued
to
gaze
up
her
hands
clasped
yes
she
was
praying
she
was
praying
for
a
little
share
of
all
that
what
was
that
absurd
livingstone
saying
marise
glanced
up
sharply
from
her
book
and
listened
why
he
was
talking
about
crittenden
old
crittenden
dead
and
had
left
that
lovely
old
mountain
home
to
some
indifferent
nephew
to
make
sure
she
put
her
book
down
and
asked
a
question
or
two
how
strange
that
she
should
be
talking
about
to
people
here
in
a
roman
ashley
crittenden
cousin
hetty
she
seemed
to
have
gone
again
back
to
her
book
but
she
was
not
reading
she
was
looking
at
a
sunlit
green
valley
a
white
road
winding
through
it
a
little
river
chanting
under
willows
low
friendly
homes
under
tall
elms
ugly
old
people
with
plain
speech
and
honest
quiet
eyes
smiling
down
lovingly
on
a
skipping
frisking
little
girl
i
see
them
shining
plain
the
happy
highways
where
i
went
and
may
not
go
again
after
a
time
she
closed
her
book
and
went
up
on
the
roof
for
a
quiet
moment
alone
to
go
back
to
ashley
to
look
at
those
blue
remembered
hills
but
there
was
some
one
else
on
the
terrazza
she
made
out
a
man
figure
under
the
grapevine
being
a
girl
she
thought
impatiently
she
was
obliged
to
turn
back
and
shut
herself
up
in
her
stuffy
room
it
continued
to
be
exactly
as
it
had
been
in
bayonne
the
world
was
one
great
jeanne
with
a
nose
twitching
for
scandal
ashley
was
far
away
she
had
watched
the
horrid
little
tragedy
of
the
swallow
with
such
intensity
that
when
the
catastrophe
came
she
almost
felt
those
curved
claws
sink
into
her
own
flesh
dieu
what
was
that
man
doing
climbing
out
of
the
window
a
madman
no
had
seen
the
cat
too
what
a
leap
and
now
how
he
ran
like
a
alla
passage
he
had
caught
that
wretched
cat
but
the
swallow
was
dead
he
was
too
late
how
gently
he
picked
it
up
did
ever
feel
compassion
for
things
hurt
oh
the
swallow
had
flown
out
of
his
hands
how
it
soared
up
and
up
who
would
not
soar
saved
by
a
strong
kind
hand
from
such
terror
he
had
turned
to
come
back
it
was
a
good
face
but
after
she
had
seen
the
expression
of
the
steady
eyes
she
could
see
nothing
but
that
eyes
that
looked
kind
but
not
weak
in
the
world
about
marise
it
had
been
an
understood
axiom
that
only
weak
people
were
kind
and
what
now
eh
to
defend
the
cat
what
did
he
care
about
a
cat
yet
she
saw
it
at
once
what
he
wanted
was
justice
think
of
any
wanting
justice
for
anything
let
alone
a
no
how
quaint
how
amusing
one
unexpected
thing
after
another
he
was
a
bit
conceited
about
what
he
done
how
that
he
was
embarrassed
and
shy
why
no
man
with
latin
blood
could
have
restrained
himself
by
any
effort
of
from
a
little
flourish
of
after
such
a
dashing
exploit
he
was
thinking
how
she
must
be
admiring
him
he
was
thinking
of
himself
at
all
how
how
to
see
him
blushing
and
stammering
like
a
nice
nice
boy
she
could
scarcely
keep
back
the
laugh
of
touched
and
pleased
amusement
that
came
to
her
lips
eh
bien
he
might
blush
easily
and
be
shy
but
he
knew
as
well
as
any
latin
how
to
catch
at
a
chance
indication
from
a
woman
and
how
to
be
at
the
right
place
at
the
right
hour
when
she
and
il
maestro
came
out
of
donna
antonia
door
she
saw
his
tall
figure
at
the
end
of
the
street
ridiculous
what
a
start
it
gave
her
and
as
soon
as
visconti
had
left
her
there
he
was
beside
her
with
one
long
bound
now
she
would
really
look
at
him
enumeratingly
and
see
what
sort
of
face
he
had
but
when
she
looked
at
him
she
saw
that
his
eyes
were
smiling
down
at
her
and
she
went
no
further
than
the
eyes
again
she
began
to
tell
him
about
ashley
of
which
she
had
dreamed
the
night
before
the
first
time
in
so
long
it
had
been
a
good
dream
all
about
going
home
to
cousin
hetty
and
playing
dolls
up
in
the
attic
again
and
it
was
good
how
good
to
talk
to
some
one
about
it
the
first
time
why
since
she
had
left
ashley
he
seemed
like
like
what
americans
meant
when
they
spoke
of
their
own
home
folks
marise
had
never
had
any
such
there
was
a
real
reason
to
give
herself
the
fun
of
telling
about
crittenden
too
since
this
crittenden
was
soon
to
be
there
she
would
just
let
herself
go
for
once
but
how
she
did
run
on
when
she
let
herself
go
she
hardly
knew
herself
chattering
like
this
as
fast
as
her
tongue
could
wag
chattering
and
laughing
and
gesticulating
and
not
able
to
stop
the
foolish
way
people
do
who
have
drunk
too
much
champagne
the
foolish
way
a
canary
does
when
you
take
the
dark
cloth
from
his
cage
and
he
sees
that
the
sun
is
shining
the
way
silly
girls
do
the
first
time
they
have
a
conversation
with
a
young
man
yes
that
was
the
way
her
voice
sounded
why
could
she
not
stop
chattering
and
laughing
what
must
he
be
thinking
of
her
she
would
stop
she
would
change
the
subject
she
would
look
at
her
watch
and
say
that
she
was
late
for
an
engagement
and
must
take
a
and
leave
him
forming
this
plan
she
led
him
rapidly
through
the
gate
into
the
borghese
gardens
where
there
are
no
through
which
lay
the
longest
possible
way
home
she
thought
glancingly
of
this
inconsistency
but
it
did
not
seem
very
important
to
her
because
she
began
to
be
aware
of
something
that
startled
her
a
little
she
was
now
taking
him
all
over
the
old
house
at
crittenden
yes
it
was
as
though
she
had
taken
his
hand
and
were
leading
him
through
those
fine
old
rooms
she
was
aware
of
him
like
that
as
though
their
hands
really
did
touch
warmly
and
actually
touch
and
she
liked
it
she
who
detested
above
everything
else
the
slightest
physical
contact
with
another
human
body
who
hated
men
for
only
looking
at
her
bare
arm
as
if
they
would
like
to
touch
it
oh
well
oh
well
it
was
nothing
she
brushed
it
aside
it
was
gone
she
told
herself
hastily
in
a
phrase
she
had
heard
mme
vallery
use
that
a
very
fine
physical
specimen
of
a
man
exercises
a
sort
of
unconscious
magnetism
on
every
one
near
him
that
has
no
more
real
human
significance
than
the
way
a
pebble
naturally
rolls
down
hill
and
not
up
and
he
certainly
was
what
any
one
would
call
a
fine
physical
specimen
so
tall
so
solidly
vigorously
built
with
such
a
long
swinging
step
she
glanced
at
him
as
she
talked
but
it
was
his
strength
that
gave
him
his
individuality
it
was
his
look
they
had
come
out
from
the
pincian
now
stopped
and
were
looking
at
each
other
under
the
ilex
trees
from
the
way
he
had
answered
her
astonished
question
about
china
she
had
known
that
he
was
going
to
say
something
to
her
really
something
that
he
meant
as
people
never
do
something
from
far
underneath
the
surface
but
she
had
never
dreamed
that
he
would
so
throw
open
the
doors
of
his
heart
and
let
her
look
in
to
see
something
she
had
never
thought
was
in
any
one
heart
the
honest
desire
to
do
something
with
his
life
beyond
getting
out
of
it
all
he
could
for
himself
it
was
like
daylight
shining
down
clear
into
dark
shadows
marise
dreaded
donna
antonia
musical
entertainments
they
were
nightmares
at
least
for
a
girl
with
no
recognized
definite
rung
on
the
social
ladder
as
her
own
at
least
for
a
paid
entertainer
who
was
paid
not
only
to
play
a
beethoven
sonata
but
to
look
well
to
add
to
the
social
brilliancy
of
the
evening
to
make
up
for
donna
prodigious
inertia
by
rushing
about
seeing
that
everything
went
smoothly
that
the
servants
did
not
sequester
half
the
ices
that
each
guest
had
some
one
to
talk
to
if
she
could
only
come
in
play
her
beethoven
and
go
away
again
that
was
really
all
she
was
paid
for
no
of
course
the
pay
for
the
rest
of
what
she
did
was
donna
taking
her
up
her
familiarity
in
the
great
house
those
occasional
condescending
cards
for
her
personal
friends
all
that
donna
antonia
could
do
for
a
young
pianist
future
every
one
told
her
that
her
fortunes
were
made
now
that
donna
antonia
had
taken
a
fancy
to
her
every
one
expected
her
as
a
matter
of
course
to
make
the
most
of
her
great
opportunity
to
flatter
donna
antonia
to
run
briskly
on
her
errands
to
accept
with
apparent
pleasure
the
amused
patronizing
friendliness
of
a
capricious
great
lady
who
on
some
days
was
caressing
and
petting
like
a
person
with
a
pet
cat
and
on
others
was
cold
and
distant
like
a
person
who
has
no
use
for
cats
she
was
not
only
to
play
for
donna
antonia
whenever
she
was
asked
but
sit
on
a
cushion
let
her
hair
be
stroked
and
talk
intimately
with
donna
antonia
of
things
marise
would
much
prefer
not
to
know
about
or
on
another
day
to
be
willing
to
dash
out
in
a
cab
to
get
a
delayed
dress
from
the
dressmaker
because
the
maid
was
busy
with
or
as
on
this
evening
act
the
part
of
helpful
daughter
of
the
house
when
her
real
position
which
all
the
guests
knew
perfectly
well
how
to
make
her
feel
was
that
of
temporary
toy
and
amusement
what
really
underlay
all
that
advice
to
make
the
most
of
this
great
opportunity
was
a
doubt
whether
she
was
genuinely
gifted
enough
to
make
her
own
way
by
her
talent
was
the
feeling
that
the
best
way
to
make
up
for
deficiencies
in
her
musical
equipment
was
by
accumulating
personal
influences
of
social
importance
on
her
side
the
great
opportunity
which
visconti
other
pupils
so
envied
her
was
nothing
more
or
less
than
making
the
acquaintance
of
these
wealthy
important
unmusical
people
and
being
more
adroit
in
making
use
of
them
than
they
of
her
this
was
perfectly
understood
all
around
especially
by
the
men
watching
to
find
a
weak
spot
who
looked
at
her
admiringly
and
found
graceful
things
to
say
about
her
playing
and
her
arms
and
her
hands
and
her
hair
and
everything
else
they
dared
mention
especially
by
the
old
ambrogi
with
his
brutal
certainty
that
as
long
as
he
was
mounting
in
power
any
woman
oh
they
made
her
donna
antonia
and
ambrogi
such
people
with
bags
under
their
eyes
and
flabby
necks
and
they
really
did
care
a
sou
about
each
other
he
wanted
only
to
make
use
of
the
position
that
donna
antonia
birth
gave
her
and
she
only
wanted
to
have
the
prestige
of
owning
a
politician
or
perhaps
the
prestige
of
showing
that
in
spite
of
bags
under
her
eyes
she
was
still
not
too
old
for
that
sort
of
thing
before
she
ran
up
to
make
sure
that
no
guests
were
stranded
in
the
library
without
being
served
with
ices
marise
looked
cautiously
into
the
dark
corner
on
the
landing
to
make
sure
that
ambrogi
was
not
there
horrid
an
old
man
like
that
who
could
not
keep
his
hands
off
women
thirty
years
younger
than
he
but
as
for
that
the
old
visconti
himself
could
not
keep
his
off
women
fifty
years
younger
than
he
as
she
sped
swiftly
along
the
upper
hall
a
atalanta
in
her
dress
she
was
saying
to
herself
oh
well
that
the
way
men
are
none
of
them
can
keep
their
hands
off
women
all
except
posing
marionettes
like
that
absurd
livingstone
or
men
like
her
father
who
took
it
out
in
caring
about
what
they
ate
and
drank
how
harmless
that
was
in
comparison
how
it
was
in
comparison
had
she
ever
been
impatient
with
father
because
he
cared
so
much
about
what
he
ate
and
drank
she
felt
a
little
wave
of
affection
for
him
she
really
must
try
to
get
back
to
paris
for
a
few
days
and
make
sure
that
biron
was
keeping
up
to
the
mark
there
the
last
person
was
served
and
everybody
had
somebody
to
talk
to
oh
how
tired
she
was
how
sick
of
all
this
this
was
a
soirée
musicale
these
were
the
people
on
whom
she
was
to
count
for
musical
success
she
was
supposed
to
be
here
to
play
beethoven
she
broke
into
a
nervous
laugh
at
the
idea
of
course
she
had
known
that
livingstone
would
be
enchanted
at
the
invitation
from
donna
antonia
and
of
course
crittenden
would
be
too
anybody
would
to
have
made
such
an
impression
on
ambrogi
it
was
remarkable
but
he
was
enchanted
he
said
he
was
going
what
under
the
sun
did
that
mean
did
he
think
he
could
get
an
invitation
to
dinner
if
he
held
off
from
this
one
to
tea
yes
probably
that
was
it
well
she
sure
that
was
the
way
to
work
ambrogi
still
you
never
could
tell
perhaps
the
boldness
of
it
might
take
ambrogi
fancy
how
funny
funny
funny
the
head
ambrogi
would
show
at
the
when
poor
livingstone
turned
up
alone
with
that
manner
of
his
so
proud
of
seeming
a
man
of
the
world
and
ambrogi
despising
men
of
the
world
for
imbeciles
she
would
tell
crittenden
about
it
when
she
next
saw
him
and
make
him
laugh
too
but
when
she
told
him
he
did
not
laugh
not
so
very
heartily
he
seemed
concerned
about
livingstone
of
all
people
was
it
possible
that
he
livingstone
could
it
be
he
was
standing
up
for
him
whether
he
liked
him
or
not
as
he
had
for
the
cat
and
now
what
a
queer
question
he
was
asking
her
about
why
she
had
said
nothing
at
the
breakfast
table
about
having
already
met
him
why
how
naïve
that
would
have
been
why
should
you
and
he
kept
on
talking
about
it
as
though
he
saw
something
in
it
she
did
not
he
was
looking
at
her
very
queerly
not
at
all
admiringly
how
strange
it
seemed
to
have
any
man
look
at
a
woman
and
not
pretend
at
least
to
be
admiring
her
strange
and
rude
and
uncomfortable
she
must
make
him
something
he
be
forced
then
to
smile
and
turn
it
off
whatever
it
was
with
a
pretty
phrase
that
pretended
to
be
admiring
oh
horrible
how
could
any
one
be
so
rude
why
it
was
as
though
he
had
struck
a
blow
at
her
brutal
and
why
why
what
harm
had
she
done
him
why
did
he
want
to
hurt
her
he
was
cruel
she
had
not
known
any
one
could
be
so
cruel
and
hard
hard
as
a
stone
where
was
it
she
lately
had
seen
great
hard
stones
what
could
you
do
when
some
one
was
rude
to
you
what
did
any
one
do
who
was
so
affronted
beyond
the
dark
fury
of
her
amazement
her
resentment
her
anger
her
bewilderment
a
light
began
to
break
slowly
like
a
distant
dawn
as
she
looked
at
him
stammering
remorseful
horribly
unhappy
aghast
at
what
he
had
said
but
never
once
dreaming
that
he
might
simply
unsay
it
she
became
aware
of
what
had
really
happened
she
had
asked
him
a
question
and
he
had
told
her
the
truth
chapter
xlvi
this
is
the
life
thought
livingstone
many
times
during
the
next
weeks
he
had
not
enjoyed
himself
so
thoroughly
since
he
came
to
europe
to
live
he
was
now
provided
as
he
expressed
it
with
all
the
cultural
advantages
of
europe
and
all
the
social
atmosphere
of
an
american
for
miss
mills
seemed
to
wish
to
try
along
with
pension
life
the
unchaperoned
familiarity
of
real
american
mlle
vallet
her
old
was
unceremoniously
left
behind
or
sent
out
by
herself
to
do
the
conscientious
which
took
all
her
evenings
to
record
in
her
diary
miss
mills
did
too
the
tacit
understanding
which
grew
up
at
once
was
that
they
were
all
four
seriously
to
see
rome
and
to
make
up
for
the
very
haphazard
way
in
which
heretofore
they
had
been
profiting
by
their
situation
it
was
certainly
thought
livingstone
a
most
agreeable
way
to
do
in
the
company
of
two
such
girls
one
of
them
with
money
to
burn
of
course
he
could
have
wished
they
all
would
have
preferred
some
one
less
lumpish
than
that
great
grim
crittenden
to
complete
their
quartet
but
not
every
american
is
capable
thought
livingstone
tying
his
necktie
in
the
morning
and
looking
at
himself
in
the
glass
not
every
american
is
of
taking
on
european
polish
and
of
an
american
what
could
you
expect
livingstone
admired
and
did
his
best
to
imitate
the
exquisite
of
the
two
young
ladies
which
kept
them
from
ever
showing
the
slightest
impatience
with
crittenden
as
far
as
they
were
concerned
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
crittenden
to
guess
that
he
was
not
in
the
same
class
with
the
other
three
an
occasional
quick
look
of
astonishment
from
miss
allen
when
crittenden
made
one
of
those
crude
speeches
of
his
and
a
recurring
expression
of
quiet
fatigue
on
miss
mills
face
when
they
had
had
a
little
too
large
a
dose
of
crittenden
were
the
only
traces
of
their
real
feelings
which
showed
on
the
surface
that
famous
soirée
at
donna
antonia
pierleoni
had
seemed
to
be
the
start
of
all
this
agreeable
new
period
of
sociability
livingstone
abhorred
fatuous
men
but
it
really
was
rather
a
remarkable
coincidence
that
after
seeing
him
for
the
first
long
talk
they
had
ever
had
miss
mills
should
at
once
have
decided
to
come
to
the
where
he
was
staying
she
had
never
had
a
real
opportunity
to
know
him
before
that
mlle
vallet
always
shadowing
her
around
the
conversation
always
stiffly
in
french
in
deference
to
mlle
vallet
feelings
that
after
her
first
real
impression
of
him
she
should
immediately
have
moved
into
a
room
three
doors
down
the
corridor
from
his
any
man
might
be
pardoned
for
considering
it
marked
really
marked
it
quite
fluttered
livingstone
with
the
idea
of
the
possibilities
involved
although
he
scorned
above
all
other
men
it
was
not
her
fortune
it
was
her
wonderful
little
person
that
he
admired
the
perfection
of
the
finish
of
every
detail
of
her
body
and
mind
livingstone
often
felt
a
sincere
reverence
as
he
looked
at
her
beautiful
hair
and
skin
and
clothes
and
hands
and
feet
that
had
cost
oh
nobody
knew
how
much
to
bring
them
to
that
condition
and
her
accomplishments
her
exquisite
french
and
pure
italian
her
knowledge
of
and
which
luini
was
considered
authentic
and
which
spurious
the
harmonious
way
she
sat
down
or
stood
or
sat
at
table
there
was
a
product
of
european
civilization
at
its
finest
how
crude
and
the
usual
striding
american
girl
would
seem
beside
her
like
a
rough
splintery
board
beside
a
finished
piece
of
marquetry
even
miss
allen
who
was
one
might
say
carelessly
and
indifferently
european
simply
because
she
happened
to
have
been
brought
up
in
france
often
seemed
rough
and
abrupt
compared
to
her
there
was
nothing
of
the
deliberate
finished
about
miss
allen
manners
which
livingstone
had
learned
to
admire
as
the
finest
flower
of
sophistication
it
was
true
she
really
did
play
the
piano
very
brilliantly
but
still
she
had
to
make
her
living
somehow
one
could
be
reasonably
sure
with
her
good
looks
that
she
was
counting
on
using
the
concert
platform
if
indeed
she
got
to
it
as
an
angling
station
from
which
to
fish
for
wealthy
eligibles
crittenden
need
fool
himself
that
she
would
ever
look
at
with
that
ridiculous
little
inheritance
he
had
played
up
so
on
his
arrival
in
rome
not
that
crittenden
seemed
to
be
trying
to
make
an
impression
quite
the
contrary
was
there
anybody
who
more
than
that
poor
fellow
seemed
possessed
to
put
his
worst
foot
foremost
if
they
had
been
pitiable
livingstone
could
have
laughed
at
the
breaks
crittenden
constantly
made
at
the
way
he
was
everlastingly
showing
himself
up
as
entirely
an
outsider
to
their
world
that
evening
when
they
fell
to
talking
of
their
favorite
dishes
was
a
sample
as
a
parlor
amusement
they
had
been
challenging
each
other
to
construct
imaginary
meals
such
as
would
be
perfection
if
you
could
only
get
them
together
sole
frite
from
the
ambassadeurs
roast
duck
with
the
inimitable
sauce
of
foyot
asti
spumanti
the
brie
straight
from
the
only
farm
in
the
that
made
it
right
all
that
sort
of
exquisite
imaginings
when
turn
came
had
he
risen
to
the
occasion
had
he
made
the
slightest
effort
to
make
a
decent
appearance
no
he
had
said
oh
count
me
out
on
this
i
have
a
regular
appetite
and
if
it
begins
to
fail
i
go
out
and
run
a
mile
and
then
i
can
eat
anything
livingstone
tried
his
best
to
cover
up
such
breaks
with
hasty
tactful
improvisations
of
talk
but
he
had
noticed
the
amazed
stare
with
which
miss
allen
had
received
this
particular
revelation
of
crudity
miss
mills
had
stared
too
or
as
near
to
it
as
she
ever
came
over
in
the
capitoline
when
she
had
asked
crittenden
if
he
happened
to
know
anything
about
constantius
chlorus
at
whose
ugly
face
they
were
just
then
looking
crittenden
had
answered
in
that
coarse
comic
jargon
he
occasionally
affected
that
he
did
remember
reading
a
thing
about
him
but
if
there
was
anything
in
physiognomy
he
must
have
been
a
who
had
sandbagged
his
way
to
the
head
of
the
machine
miss
allen
had
not
been
able
to
avoid
laughing
at
him
outright
then
and
miss
mills
look
had
been
all
too
eloquent
but
the
worst
was
the
provinciality
of
his
attitude
about
his
avowal
of
a
regular
ignorance
of
paintings
and
his
refusal
to
try
to
learn
to
appreciate
them
there
are
only
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
he
said
about
a
dozen
canvases
in
all
europe
that
i
really
to
look
at
and
you
do
catch
me
trailing
around
till
my
feet
drop
off
looking
at
all
the
thousands
of
that
give
me
a
pain
why
should
i
livingstone
was
so
shocked
and
grieved
by
the
crassness
of
such
a
statement
that
he
really
longed
to
take
crittenden
in
hand
he
knew
so
well
how
to
learn
to
like
pictures
because
although
he
would
not
have
admitted
it
to
any
one
he
had
begun
as
crassly
as
crittenden
he
what
to
do
he
could
tell
crittenden
step
by
step
how
to
pull
himself
up
to
a
higher
level
because
he
had
done
it
himself
you
read
esthetic
books
lots
of
them
and
all
the
descriptions
of
paintings
you
could
lay
your
hands
on
and
all
the
stories
you
could
find
in
vasari
or
any
one
else
about
the
lives
of
the
painters
livingstone
had
a
whole
shelf
of
books
of
that
sort
that
were
reading
as
amusing
as
la
vie
parisienne
and
you
read
what
ruskin
and
symonds
had
thought
about
this
or
that
canvas
and
what
berenson
researches
had
proved
about
its
authenticity
if
you
could
you
took
the
book
right
along
with
you
to
the
gallery
reading
about
the
picture
as
you
looked
at
it
and
you
kept
at
it
till
you
see
in
it
what
people
said
was
there
that
was
the
way
to
form
your
taste
even
crittenden
could
get
somewhere
along
those
lines
if
he
tried
but
he
seemed
to
have
no
interest
in
anything
but
history
and
michael
angelo
crittenden
was
perversely
fond
of
dragging
them
over
to
the
sistine
chapel
till
their
heads
were
ready
to
drop
off
with
the
fatigue
of
staring
up
at
those
sprawling
figures
there
was
however
one
advantage
about
the
expedition
to
the
sistine
chapel
they
were
always
so
fearfully
tired
afterwards
that
they
took
a
cab
back
to
the
piazza
venezia
and
had
ices
together
at
a
café
it
was
the
first
time
since
he
had
lived
in
europe
that
livingstone
had
been
able
to
walk
into
a
café
with
a
handsome
woman
and
watch
the
other
men
stare
that
was
a
european
manoeuver
which
he
had
not
somehow
been
able
to
accomplish
a
american
with
her
baedecker
in
her
ungloved
hand
being
by
no
means
a
figure
to
make
other
men
stare
of
course
it
was
perfectly
evident
that
miss
mills
and
miss
allen
were
only
nice
girls
he
hoped
it
was
not
apparent
that
they
were
only
americans
but
they
were
handsome
and
miss
mills
was
always
stunningly
dressed
it
was
next
best
to
what
livingstone
had
always
secretly
longed
to
do
as
eating
his
frugal
he
had
watched
a
medaled
italian
officer
or
monocled
sitting
opposite
a
conspicuous
with
slippers
a
provocative
gown
and
a
huge
hat
shading
her
roving
eyes
the
only
movable
feature
of
her
spectacular
face
painted
and
powdered
to
a
hierarchic
immobility
that
was
the
life
that
was
what
livingstone
would
love
to
do
thus
to
yourself
with
a
really
bad
woman
how
deliciously
and
cosmopolitan
on
the
other
hand
those
women
were
said
to
be
very
expensive
and
hard
to
handle
rapacious
without
the
slightest
scruple
as
to
how
they
emptied
your
pockets
livingstone
was
in
mortal
terror
of
letting
one
of
them
get
any
hold
on
him
and
his
tiny
resources
he
knew
he
would
be
no
match
for
her
and
anyhow
all
he
wanted
of
one
was
to
sit
jeweled
and
painted
and
conspicuously
across
a
table
from
him
at
a
café
so
that
other
men
would
look
at
him
as
he
now
looked
at
other
men
he
often
wished
he
could
hire
one
just
to
do
that
however
in
the
meantime
it
was
a
very
pleasant
pastime
and
might
by
george
to
something
who
knew
to
sit
across
the
table
from
two
merely
nice
but
really
very
and
girls
and
listen
to
their
innocent
prattle
and
although
they
were
americans
they
had
lived
abroad
so
much
that
they
had
many
european
ways
which
livingstone
found
very
fascinating
and
superior
for
instance
they
were
quite
at
home
in
roman
churches
and
whenever
they
went
to
listen
to
special
music
in
some
chapel
the
girls
had
a
quick
easy
capacity
for
dropping
to
their
knees
in
a
quite
way
that
made
them
to
livingstone
eyes
fit
right
in
with
the
picture
if
it
had
not
been
for
crittenden
whose
stiff
provincial
american
joints
never
dreamed
of
bending
he
would
have
knelt
beside
the
girls
not
that
he
in
any
of
the
religious
part
of
it
but
it
was
so
european
to
go
down
on
your
knees
in
public
if
he
did
he
was
sure
that
people
around
them
would
think
that
he
was
a
member
of
one
of
those
english
catholic
families
crittenden
always
was
the
great
hulking
obstacle
in
the
way
of
any
flexible
and
gracious
europeanizing
of
their
lives
livingstone
had
seen
the
two
girls
recoil
time
and
time
again
shocked
by
his
bruskness
and
it
was
not
only
to
women
that
he
was
brusk
he
had
occasionally
an
insufferable
way
of
treating
any
one
who
approached
him
with
a
civil
question
as
when
livingstone
on
a
sudden
recollection
had
said
to
him
oh
but
by
the
way
crittenden
how
about
your
being
only
five
days
in
rome
about
it
crittenden
had
repeated
as
though
he
never
heard
of
it
before
why
you
said
you
had
to
return
at
once
that
inheritance
you
know
you
said
you
had
only
five
days
crittenden
had
had
the
impertinence
to
stare
at
him
hard
and
say
coolly
oh
you
must
be
mistaken
about
that
civilized
people
did
have
such
manners
and
that
other
time
the
evening
when
he
had
stayed
up
late
on
the
terrazza
to
smoke
with
crittenden
when
he
had
asked
but
all
men
of
the
world
agree
that
nothing
is
so
full
of
flavor
as
an
affair
with
a
married
woman
you
no
doubt
crittenden
have
also
had
your
experiences
eh
what
sort
of
an
answer
did
crittenden
consider
it
to
burst
out
with
that
sudden
great
as
though
livingstone
had
been
telling
him
a
funny
story
the
man
simply
had
no
experience
or
understanding
a
raw
crude
bumptious
provincial
that
what
was
one
who
had
not
even
sense
enough
to
know
how
pitifully
narrow
his
life
was
chapter
xlvii
coming
to
know
a
new
acquaintance
was
thought
marise
as
though
you
stood
back
of
a
painter
watching
him
stroke
by
stroke
paint
the
portrait
of
a
sitter
whom
you
could
not
see
of
course
neale
crittenden
like
every
one
else
was
physically
quite
visible
and
like
every
one
else
entirely
hidden
by
this
apparent
visibility
what
you
saw
of
people
surfaces
and
what
was
really
there
were
two
very
different
matters
marise
had
learned
this
axiom
if
no
other
what
she
saw
of
the
newcomer
was
quite
startlingly
disturbingly
attractive
to
her
all
the
more
reason
to
draw
back
warily
and
look
carefully
before
she
took
a
step
forward
when
on
seeing
him
for
the
first
time
in
the
morning
or
coming
on
him
unexpectedly
towering
up
above
the
crowd
in
some
narrow
dark
roman
street
she
felt
the
ridiculous
impulse
to
run
to
meet
him
like
a
child
she
told
herself
impatiently
that
it
was
due
to
mere
physical
elements
his
health
the
great
strength
which
made
itself
felt
in
his
quietest
movements
and
a
certain
expression
of
his
eyes
which
might
very
well
not
have
the
slightest
connection
with
his
personality
which
might
be
a
mere
trick
of
the
way
his
eyes
were
set
in
his
head
perhaps
they
chose
the
show
priests
for
the
great
festivals
at
lourdes
for
some
such
casual
gifts
of
physical
magnetism
no
there
was
nothing
whatever
to
be
known
from
surfaces
marise
told
herself
the
subject
of
the
portrait
was
always
really
quite
invisible
behind
the
thick
thick
screen
of
his
physical
presence
all
that
was
safe
to
do
was
to
watch
the
strokes
by
which
one
by
one
he
himself
painted
his
own
portrait
marise
often
told
herself
all
this
as
she
was
hurrying
down
the
corridor
to
be
the
first
person
in
the
breakfast
room
the
first
that
is
after
crittenden
who
was
a
very
early
riser
i
to
begin
with
there
was
the
dashing
outline
sketch
of
the
first
two
or
three
days
when
in
a
few
bold
lines
he
had
seemed
to
set
up
the
figure
on
the
canvas
the
rescue
of
the
swallow
justice
for
the
cat
that
first
walk
and
homesick
talk
about
ashley
and
at
the
end
those
stammering
words
of
his
which
had
seemed
to
show
oh
that
had
now
turned
unreal
to
marise
he
could
have
said
that
and
meant
it
then
the
soirée
the
impression
of
force
and
originality
he
had
made
on
the
people
he
had
met
there
her
natural
certainty
that
he
must
of
course
have
calculated
that
impression
in
order
to
profit
by
it
and
then
at
this
recollection
marise
always
laughed
silently
at
her
own
astonishment
when
he
had
called
donna
antonia
a
stupid
old
woman
donna
antonia
certainly
was
that
and
every
one
knew
it
but
nobody
else
would
dream
of
saying
it
out
loud
any
more
than
they
would
give
their
honest
impression
of
the
ritual
of
a
secret
society
ii
and
then
just
when
she
had
been
so
drawn
towards
him
by
his
strength
and
kindness
that
brusk
blow
in
the
face
marise
had
felt
many
times
before
this
a
thin
keen
blade
slipped
into
her
back
by
a
hand
that
took
care
to
be
invisible
but
never
before
had
she
encountered
open
roughness
it
was
staggering
always
as
she
remembered
it
her
first
thought
was
as
it
had
been
then
a
horrified
wonder
why
any
one
should
wish
to
hurt
her
always
afterward
with
the
memory
of
his
dreadful
stammering
distress
his
remorseful
kissing
of
her
hands
his
helpless
inability
to
unsay
what
he
had
said
she
knew
once
more
as
she
had
known
then
that
she
had
encountered
something
new
something
altogether
different
from
any
human
relationship
she
had
ever
known
a
relationship
where
you
did
not
say
things
in
order
to
please
or
displease
people
or
to
make
this
or
that
impression
but
because
you
thought
they
were
true
that
was
fine
oh
yes
that
was
fine
but
it
was
like
dashing
yourself
against
hard
stones
it
hurt
and
it
made
her
fear
the
hand
that
had
hurt
her
she
watched
it
and
sometimes
all
but
put
out
her
fingers
to
touch
it
to
see
if
it
were
really
so
strong
and
hard
as
it
looked
she
feared
it
she
envied
its
strength
iii
that
had
been
a
stroke
of
the
brush
which
frightened
her
to
remember
but
there
were
others
that
made
her
laugh
like
the
time
off
in
a
in
the
roman
when
he
stepped
into
a
little
shop
to
buy
a
box
of
cigarettes
and
came
back
with
a
great
of
the
villainous
tobacco
issued
to
the
italian
army
unsmokable
by
any
but
an
italian
private
soldier
to
their
amazed
laughter
he
had
replied
sheepishly
with
a
boy
grin
of
embarrassment
that
the
little
daughter
of
the
ambitiously
doing
her
best
to
wait
on
a
customer
had
misunderstood
his
order
and
had
weighed
it
out
and
tied
it
up
before
he
realized
what
she
was
doing
i
was
afraid
if
i
let
them
know
she
made
a
mistake
her
father
would
jump
on
her
fathers
do
seem
to
do
such
a
tall
amount
of
scolding
anyhow
and
she
was
so
set
up
over
having
made
a
sale
all
by
herself
marise
had
laughed
with
the
others
over
that
and
laughed
when
she
thought
of
it
but
her
laugh
often
ended
abruptly
in
bewilderment
how
was
it
he
could
be
so
kind
so
tenderly
kind
to
an
italian
child
he
had
never
seen
before
and
so
sternly
rough
with
her
that
rankled
and
then
when
she
had
had
time
to
think
she
recognized
it
all
over
again
with
the
same
start
of
astonishment
for
the
she
had
never
encountered
iv
livingstone
had
said
something
sentimental
about
man
love
being
based
on
the
instinct
to
cherish
and
protect
and
woman
on
the
desire
to
be
cherished
and
protected
eugenia
had
acquiesced
marise
who
hated
talk
sentimental
or
otherwise
about
love
had
said
nothing
but
crittenden
had
protested
oh
livingstone
you
got
that
twisted
that
the
basis
of
love
between
and
children
you
insult
your
equals
trying
to
them
nothing
would
get
me
more
up
in
the
air
than
to
have
somebody
me
from
life
why
should
i
want
to
do
it
to
anybody
else
protect
your
grandmother
a
woman
wants
to
be
let
alone
to
take
her
chances
in
life
as
much
as
a
man
v
they
were
crossing
the
forum
on
their
way
to
a
stroll
in
the
shady
walks
of
the
palatine
from
the
battered
shapeless
ruins
of
what
had
been
the
throbbing
center
of
the
world
rose
suffocatingly
to
senses
the
effluvium
of
weariness
and
decay
she
always
felt
that
antiquity
breathed
out
upon
her
a
cold
dusty
she
thought
of
this
turning
an
attentive
face
and
inattentive
ear
to
livingstone
who
was
trying
to
make
out
from
his
where
the
temple
of
mars
had
stood
you
holding
that
map
wrong
end
to
said
crittenden
it
too
hot
to
stand
here
in
the
sun
said
eugenia
very
sensibly
they
passed
on
over
heaps
of
ancient
refuse
into
the
ruins
of
the
palace
of
the
cæsars
silent
now
not
an
echo
left
of
all
the
humming
poisonous
intrigues
that
had
filled
it
full
here
said
livingstone
stopping
in
a
vaulted
chamber
ostensibly
to
comment
on
things
really
to
get
his
breath
after
the
climb
here
in
such
a
room
only
lined
and
paved
with
priceless
marbles
and
hung
with
asiatic
silks
here
you
lay
at
ease
in
an
embroidered
toga
on
a
couch
and
clapped
your
hands
for
a
slave
to
bring
you
your
falernian
wine
cooled
with
snow
from
monte
cavo
that
was
the
life
i
thought
it
was
in
the
arabian
nights
you
clapped
your
hands
for
a
slave
said
eugenia
in
rome
you
probably
cracked
a
whip
suggested
crittenden
but
i
bet
you
a
nickel
it
did
make
any
difference
you
did
your
slave
came
when
he
got
good
and
ready
and
brought
you
another
kind
of
wine
from
the
one
you
ordered
and
lukewarm
at
that
they
probably
used
up
all
the
monte
cavo
snow
to
cool
the
wine
down
in
the
hall
what
possible
basis
have
you
for
saying
all
cried
livingstone
exasperated
that
the
way
things
are
folks
that
try
to
use
slave
labor
always
get
what
coming
to
them
in
the
way
of
poor
service
oh
but
in
rome
you
had
the
right
to
kill
him
cried
livingstone
jealous
of
his
rights
sure
you
could
kill
him
and
in
new
york
you
can
fire
your
stenographer
what
good
would
that
do
you
you
could
get
intelligent
service
out
of
the
next
slave
either
unless
you
had
him
educated
to
be
intelligent
and
if
you
did
that
he
be
such
a
rare
bird
that
save
him
for
something
better
than
standing
around
waiting
for
you
to
clap
your
hands
at
him
he
be
running
your
business
for
you
oh
pshaw
crittenden
why
be
so
and
literal
why
imaginative
fancy
oh
i
did
realize
you
were
imaginatively
fancying
said
crittenden
laughing
i
thought
you
were
trying
imaginatively
to
reconstruct
the
life
of
ancient
rome
and
i
was
trying
to
do
my
share
they
passed
through
dusky
passages
clambered
over
a
pile
of
rubble
and
stood
in
twilight
at
the
foot
of
a
long
steep
vaulted
stairway
far
up
like
a
bright
roof
to
its
obscurity
were
green
leaves
blue
sky
bright
sunshine
all
that
sparkling
clear
radiance
seemed
to
heighten
the
boyish
fit
of
high
spirits
that
had
entered
into
the
usually
rather
silent
crittenden
he
pointed
up
to
the
stairway
and
cried
from
antiquity
to
the
present
i
meet
you
at
the
top
and
off
he
went
bounding
up
the
high
steep
steps
two
at
a
time
as
if
his
vitality
had
suddenly
swept
him
away
in
the
need
for
violent
exertion
when
the
two
girls
emerged
later
ladies
allow
me
to
introduce
to
you
the
present
day
he
said
calling
to
their
attention
with
a
sweep
of
his
hat
the
dark
sumptuous
green
of
the
cypresses
and
pines
the
splendor
of
the
sky
the
fresh
sprinkled
smell
of
the
earth
on
the
shady
paths
not
so
bad
for
poor
little
old
actuality
is
it
the
girls
sank
breathlessly
on
a
bench
livingstone
appeared
slowly
hoisting
himself
up
the
steps
one
at
a
time
and
puffing
crittenden
walked
around
and
around
restlessly
as
though
that
upward
swoop
had
been
but
an
appetizer
to
his
desire
to
let
out
the
superabundance
of
his
strength
he
looked
marise
thought
like
a
fretting
and
pawing
and
stepping
sideways
how
could
he
have
that
eager
look
in
this
dusty
cemetery
of
human
strength
and
eagerness
glancing
up
at
his
face
she
saw
it
lighted
and
shining
with
amusement
what
seemed
like
tender
touched
amusement
he
was
looking
at
something
down
the
path
marise
looked
with
him
and
saw
a
workingman
one
of
the
gardeners
digging
in
the
earth
of
a
beside
him
capered
and
staggered
a
little
puppy
a
nondescript
little
brown
cur
with
neither
good
looks
nor
distinction
but
so
enchanted
with
life
with
itself
with
the
soft
good
earth
over
which
it
pranced
that
to
see
it
was
thought
marise
like
playing
weber
perpetual
motion
as
she
looked
it
tried
to
run
in
a
wavering
circle
around
its
master
tripped
over
its
own
feet
tumbled
head
over
heels
in
a
soft
ball
clumsily
struggled
up
and
sat
down
to
draw
breath
a
pink
tongue
hanging
out
of
its
wide
laughing
mouth
its
soft
young
eyes
beaming
with
mirth
at
its
own
adventures
its
master
glanced
down
and
addressed
some
clucking
friendly
greeting
to
it
which
threw
it
into
an
agony
of
joy
wagging
its
tail
till
its
whole
body
wagged
it
flung
itself
adoringly
at
its
master
trousers
pawing
and
wriggling
in
ecstasy
crittenden
caught
marise
eye
and
shared
with
her
in
a
silent
smile
his
delighted
sense
of
the
little
animal
absurdity
perhaps
if
we
looked
down
from
this
height
and
got
a
view
we
could
settle
that
point
said
eugenia
to
livingstone
who
was
still
concerned
about
the
location
of
the
temple
of
mars
there
a
fine
view
from
the
wall
at
the
end
of
this
path
they
strolled
together
to
the
wall
and
livingstone
spread
out
on
it
his
plan
of
the
forum
marise
looked
down
dispiritedly
at
the
mutilated
pillars
and
broken
pieces
of
carved
marble
and
most
of
all
at
the
bits
of
old
roman
flagged
paving
nothing
gave
her
a
more
acrid
sense
of
futility
than
those
old
old
over
which
so
many
thousands
of
human
feet
had
eagerly
blindly
sought
their
journey
end
had
any
of
them
ever
found
what
they
sought
she
murmured
under
her
breath
is
it
all
horribly
horribly
depressing
does
it
make
you
feel
all
those
endless
centuries
bowing
your
shoulders
down
to
the
earth
why
not
now
as
well
as
later
she
had
stated
it
as
she
felt
it
a
truism
what
every
one
must
feel
eugenia
and
livingstone
accepted
it
as
such
yes
i
often
feel
as
ancient
as
the
stones
said
eugenia
pensively
crittenden
put
in
hastily
not
on
your
life
it
does
depress
me
why
should
it
you
do
seem
to
realize
miss
allen
what
an
immense
difference
there
is
between
us
i
never
really
took
it
in
before
myself
not
until
this
visit
to
rome
but
it
immense
enormous
let
me
tell
you
about
it
they
dead
and
we
are
alive
alive
marise
looked
up
at
him
thinking
that
in
truth
she
had
never
felt
any
one
so
alive
he
bent
his
eyes
to
hers
as
livingstone
with
a
little
gesture
of
giving
him
up
drew
eugenia
to
the
corner
of
the
wall
and
traced
lines
on
his
map
crittenden
went
on
whimsically
i
do
believe
you
ever
fully
considered
the
great
importance
of
that
point
miss
allen
it
came
home
to
me
all
over
again
as
i
was
looking
at
that
puppy
millions
of
dogs
have
lived
and
died
before
him
but
by
some
amazing
miracle
life
is
just
as
fresh
a
wonder
to
him
as
if
he
were
the
first
puppy
ever
born
into
the
world
it
incredible
i
never
realized
it
till
i
struck
all
these
relics
of
men
it
incredible
how
none
of
them
not
all
the
millions
of
them
can
tarnish
the
newness
of
my
own
life
for
me
i
can
go
my
own
new
path
over
those
old
me
and
the
puppy
and
you
and
all
of
us
marise
laughed
a
little
still
looking
at
him
listening
to
something
he
was
not
saying
which
played
about
his
bold
clear
face
like
sunlight
and
shone
on
her
as
warmly
now
a
spark
of
wildness
came
into
his
eyes
half
laughingly
reckless
half
desperately
in
earnest
you
saw
what
happened
to
the
puppy
when
its
master
threw
it
a
kind
word
well
i
have
the
gift
of
wriggling
all
over
so
wonderfully
as
that
and
i
have
any
tail
to
wag
but
when
you
look
at
me
like
that
miss
allen
i
we
the
third
line
of
is
the
side
wall
of
the
basilica
julia
said
eugenia
stepping
towards
them
the
in
her
hand
vi
they
were
standing
under
the
great
gray
dome
of
the
pantheon
innocent
clear
daylight
flooding
all
the
great
gray
building
oh
is
it
beautiful
their
idea
of
leaving
the
circle
open
to
the
sky
marise
burst
out
does
it
make
our
dark
modern
churches
with
their
imitation
gothic
seem
cheap
and
affected
every
church
all
over
the
world
ought
to
be
like
this
and
then
we
human
beings
might
be
fit
to
live
with
livingstone
put
in
a
horrified
protest
what
miss
all
that
exquisite
twilight
that
makes
a
church
a
church
i
was
just
thinking
how
fiercely
literally
bright
this
noonday
sun
is
daylight
leaves
no
mystery
nothing
to
your
imagination
marise
turned
confidently
to
crittenden
as
an
ally
she
was
sure
as
sure
of
anything
in
the
world
that
he
must
be
on
her
side
but
he
hedged
and
said
neutrally
oh
great
scott
it
would
be
a
horrible
act
of
tyranny
to
have
every
church
like
this
there
are
lots
of
folks
who
hate
it
they
have
a
right
to
have
some
things
their
way
they
oh
i
think
take
that
side
said
marise
feeling
betrayed
and
longing
for
a
sweeping
exclusive
affirmation
to
match
her
own
he
so
often
hedged
it
seemed
to
her
wanted
to
qualify
statements
oh
it
came
to
her
with
a
start
that
was
another
form
of
he
was
trying
to
make
his
statements
express
the
truth
rather
than
his
feelings
he
now
said
judicially
as
far
as
i
personally
go
it
depends
what
looking
at
if
i
looking
at
a
very
fine
statue
or
something
that
seems
really
beautiful
to
me
i
want
as
good
a
light
as
possible
to
see
it
in
if
if
i
should
ever
have
any
personal
happiness
in
my
life
i
want
daylight
to
see
it
by
but
when
it
a
question
of
looking
at
the
interior
decoration
of
the
average
modern
church
why
the
more
mystery
and
twilight
the
better
this
made
marise
laugh
he
often
made
her
laugh
more
than
she
had
ever
laughed
before
and
yet
he
never
told
funny
stories
he
now
went
on
i
suppose
it
depends
on
your
opinion
of
what
there
is
to
see
if
you
think
your
imagination
can
do
better
for
you
than
reality
of
course
you
want
a
lot
left
to
it
and
plenty
of
dark
corners
for
it
to
work
in
just
now
it
seems
to
me
that
reality
is
so
much
beyond
anything
my
poor
starved
imagination
could
have
done
he
did
not
look
at
marise
as
he
spoke
his
tone
was
perfectly
matter
of
fact
she
wondered
what
the
other
two
made
out
of
it
she
knew
very
well
what
she
made
out
of
it
vii
they
were
sitting
on
the
terrazza
in
the
evening
with
several
other
people
from
the
having
their
coffee
sociably
around
the
big
round
table
and
looking
out
over
the
roofs
and
domes
and
of
rome
the
conversation
had
been
as
was
usual
during
and
crittenden
had
contributed
little
to
it
his
massive
capacity
for
silence
when
he
had
nothing
special
to
say
was
a
constant
source
of
wonder
to
marise
not
to
make
talk
even
very
commonplace
talk
was
a
betrayal
of
a
tacitly
accepted
code
as
much
as
calling
donna
antonia
a
stupid
old
woman
she
had
been
taught
that
it
was
one
of
the
pretenses
which
must
be
kept
up
under
penalty
of
the
ruin
of
all
civilized
intercourse
she
envied
and
resented
his
freedom
from
it
she
addressed
herself
directly
to
him
now
to
force
him
out
of
his
reflective
taciturnity
do
you
agree
to
that
mr
crittenden
to
what
he
asked
making
no
decent
pretense
of
being
abashed
because
he
had
not
been
following
the
conversation
why
livingstone
was
saying
that
artists
are
the
only
human
beings
to
be
envied
the
only
human
beings
who
really
intensely
they
the
only
ones
who
talk
about
it
he
offered
as
his
variation
on
the
dictum
that
what
an
artist
is
he
somebody
who
happens
to
be
put
together
so
that
it
kills
him
to
keep
anything
to
himself
he
just
goes
up
in
smoke
if
he
ca
run
and
tell
the
world
what
he
has
seen
or
tasted
or
handled
or
got
hit
by
and
the
way
it
made
him
feel
i
admire
and
revere
artists
they
certainly
do
a
lot
for
the
rest
of
us
but
i
do
see
any
reason
to
think
that
they
feel
things
any
more
intensely
than
anybody
else
and
i
do
see
anything
so
terribly
enviable
in
their
lot
there
seems
to
be
a
lot
of
hard
work
about
it
if
you
judge
by
the
way
they
carry
on
i
do
see
why
you
ca
enjoy
beauty
and
feel
tragedy
even
if
you
keep
your
mouth
shut
you
can
feel
it
just
the
same
ca
you
i
sure
i
felt
things
about
a
million
times
more
intensely
than
anything
that
ever
got
into
a
book
and
i
ca
say
i
any
less
satisfied
with
my
fate
because
not
thriftily
trying
to
use
those
same
feelings
as
raw
material
for
an
art
marise
was
laughing
outrageously
by
the
time
he
had
finished
partly
at
what
he
said
partly
at
livingstone
scandalized
expression
she
was
ashamed
of
the
way
she
laughed
over
crittenden
teasing
of
poor
unconscious
livingstone
you
do
understand
crittenden
you
do
get
my
point
at
all
there
something
something
livingstone
brought
it
out
with
a
remnant
of
the
provincial
before
fine
phrases
which
he
so
deplored
there
something
divine
in
being
an
artist
something
crittenden
moved
from
his
negligent
pose
tightened
up
a
little
oh
if
you
mean
by
a
class
broad
enough
to
take
in
everybody
who
creates
something
yes
of
course
they
the
only
ones
who
really
live
that
what
most
of
us
are
trying
to
get
a
chance
to
do
trying
to
create
a
little
order
out
of
chaos
but
that
pretty
nearly
the
whole
of
the
human
race
is
it
except
the
leisure
classes
livingstone
was
in
despair
of
making
the
philistine
understand
it
something
we
have
so
little
of
in
america
it
hard
for
an
american
to
recognize
its
existence
he
murmured
to
the
company
in
extenuation
of
his
compatriot
denseness
crittenden
sat
up
straighter
i
used
to
make
my
living
buying
and
selling
lumber
in
the
new
england
states
he
said
addressing
himself
for
once
to
the
company
and
on
one
of
my
trips
i
met
a
man
in
a
narrow
mountain
valley
up
there
who
was
a
creator
if
there
ever
was
one
he
had
started
life
as
a
mechanic
left
school
and
went
to
work
at
sixteen
in
a
shop
filled
with
soulless
cogs
and
bolts
and
screws
and
springs
and
his
creative
instinct
rose
up
and
seized
on
those
things
as
the
appointed
raw
stuff
for
his
creation
when
i
saw
him
he
was
the
head
of
one
of
the
biggest
factories
in
the
country
a
good
many
hundred
men
working
for
him
and
devoted
to
him
turning
out
tools
that
have
simplified
the
tasks
of
mechanics
the
world
around
i
never
saw
a
happier
man
i
never
saw
a
human
life
more
completely
fulfilled
yes
you
right
livingstone
the
creators
are
the
enviable
ones
that
was
in
the
least
what
i
said
or
meant
protested
livingstone
warmly
it
happens
to
be
fresh
in
my
mind
said
crittenden
half
apologizing
for
his
unusual
loquacity
because
walking
on
the
due
macelli
i
happened
to
see
a
case
of
his
tools
and
outside
just
glued
to
the
window
a
young
italian
mechanic
gazing
in
at
them
his
face
on
fire
with
his
admiration
and
appreciation
quite
a
long
way
is
it
for
a
yankee
creator
to
reach
out
a
helpful
and
stimulating
hand
but
he
a
of
course
a
genius
the
rest
of
us
hope
to
do
that
later
as
they
all
went
down
the
stairs
together
marise
asked
him
but
there
is
anything
is
there
that
the
rest
of
us
not
creative
geniuses
can
hope
to
do
that
creative
she
had
not
the
faintest
idea
what
he
could
find
to
answer
she
herself
could
conceive
of
no
answer
possible
with
all
the
intelligent
people
she
had
ever
known
it
had
been
axiomatic
that
there
no
answer
he
did
not
speak
at
once
she
had
noticed
that
he
often
took
time
to
reflect
seriously
on
what
you
had
said
before
he
replied
marise
had
never
seen
any
one
before
who
seemed
to
give
so
much
more
care
to
understanding
what
you
said
than
to
concocting
something
that
would
sound
well
to
say
in
answer
there
were
times
when
incredible
as
it
seemed
crittenden
seemed
really
to
use
language
to
express
what
he
meant
rather
than
to
attain
his
ends
she
waited
now
and
as
she
waited
she
was
aware
of
the
erectness
and
vigor
of
the
tall
body
stepping
beside
her
in
the
corridor
he
halted
for
a
moment
facing
her
his
head
bent
thoughtfully
his
eyes
shadowed
by
his
broad
brow
his
hand
that
powerful
athlete
hand
of
his
meditatively
over
his
mouth
as
he
considered
he
had
given
her
question
a
good
deal
of
thought
and
yet
when
he
took
his
hand
down
to
speak
he
said
abruptly
impulsively
as
though
the
words
had
broken
up
through
what
he
had
been
meaning
to
say
we
any
of
us
could
we
hope
to
create
a
beautiful
human
relationship
beautiful
and
enduring
chapter
xlviii
neale
was
in
despair
at
his
dumb
helplessness
before
the
inert
resistance
of
social
relations
a
man
with
any
adroitness
would
not
submit
passively
to
this
tradition
that
he
and
livingstone
and
marise
allen
and
eugenia
mills
formed
an
indissoluble
foursome
never
to
advance
or
retreat
save
in
a
solid
bloc
like
a
french
family
with
all
the
uncles
and
cousins
and
aunts
how
had
it
started
certainly
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
that
what
you
got
for
being
and
literal
as
he
was
about
personal
relations
the
practised
old
hands
ran
circles
around
you
and
had
things
all
their
own
way
such
at
least
was
the
color
of
neale
meditations
when
he
was
alone
in
his
own
room
when
as
one
of
the
quartet
he
set
off
on
a
new
expedition
he
could
think
of
nothing
but
his
pleasure
at
being
there
at
all
walking
beside
her
catching
sidelong
glimpses
of
her
when
he
was
supposed
to
be
looking
at
a
statue
or
a
fresco
talking
to
her
over
the
others
heads
trying
to
say
something
to
through
the
infernally
general
conversation
which
livingstone
kept
up
as
though
his
tongue
were
hung
in
the
middle
and
there
was
a
certain
advantage
too
he
was
not
enough
to
label
it
but
he
recognized
and
was
quick
to
profit
by
it
this
parading
around
in
a
group
gave
the
most
intoxicating
quality
of
intimacy
to
the
brief
snatched
occasions
when
he
did
manage
to
see
her
alone
even
though
a
good
many
of
these
few
precious
moments
were
as
a
matter
of
actual
fact
passed
on
a
noisy
waiting
for
a
to
come
and
carry
her
off
or
on
a
narrow
roman
sidewalk
trying
to
keep
abreast
of
her
as
she
stepped
quickly
through
the
dense
sauntering
italian
crowd
stopping
five
deep
to
stare
at
something
in
a
window
or
holding
noisy
and
affectionate
family
reunions
on
the
sidewalk
none
of
that
mattered
the
noise
the
clatter
of
tongues
the
pressing
and
shoving
of
the
crowd
the
yells
of
the
it
was
all
essential
silence
to
neale
because
none
of
it
was
directed
at
keeping
him
apart
from
marise
as
was
the
urbane
conversation
of
the
quartet
he
let
himself
go
like
a
boy
as
indeed
he
never
had
as
a
boy
on
the
few
occasions
when
he
waylaid
her
in
the
street
without
eugenia
mills
who
seemed
to
have
as
great
a
passion
for
her
society
as
he
had
he
was
really
a
little
out
of
his
head
with
suspense
after
an
hour
of
anxious
waiting
about
smoking
nervous
cigarettes
his
eyes
on
both
ends
of
the
street
at
once
his
heart
leaping
up
when
he
thought
he
saw
her
tall
nobly
borne
figure
in
the
distance
dying
down
sickly
when
it
turned
out
to
be
some
other
girl
when
finally
she
was
really
there
he
was
too
elated
for
pretense
swooping
down
on
her
his
hat
in
his
hand
grinning
he
knew
it
like
an
idiot
he
saw
people
in
the
street
turn
and
look
after
him
meaningly
and
smile
to
each
other
and
what
did
he
care
how
big
a
fool
he
looked
to
them
they
fostered
for
these
queer
unprivate
intimate
moments
a
little
tradition
of
their
own
a
tacit
understanding
that
they
would
save
up
for
them
the
things
they
specially
wanted
to
talk
about
the
questions
they
wanted
to
ask
each
other
that
were
no
business
of
other
people
they
talked
as
fast
as
they
could
sometimes
marise
sometimes
neale
as
though
they
could
never
get
caught
up
on
what
they
had
to
tell
each
other
neale
was
astounded
to
hear
himself
chattering
fairly
chattering
they
talked
a
good
deal
about
ashley
a
great
deal
about
their
personal
likes
and
dislikes
a
good
deal
about
what
neale
was
trying
to
get
out
of
europe
this
seemed
to
interest
marise
curiously
to
interest
her
she
was
always
bringing
him
back
to
it
he
was
she
told
him
new
in
her
experience
of
she
had
seen
so
many
all
her
life
and
thought
she
had
them
all
sorted
and
labeled
the
kind
like
my
father
who
find
themselves
just
in
their
element
at
last
in
the
religious
seriousness
of
europe
about
eating
and
drinking
sometimes
i
think
they
the
ones
who
get
the
most
out
of
it
no
oh
no
there
another
sort
the
ones
i
specially
love
the
who
saves
up
her
money
and
comes
just
once
comes
at
with
a
ripe
mind
and
fresh
fresh
eyes
such
as
no
european
can
have
i
never
forget
what
i
heard
one
of
them
say
in
paris
i
was
tearing
along
trying
to
get
to
the
market
and
back
before
i
had
to
go
to
a
class
my
mind
full
of
nothing
but
the
price
of
new
potatoes
and
a
terribly
hard
set
of
velocity
exercises
i
just
begun
i
came
up
behind
two
such
dear
dear
american
tourists
and
heard
one
of
them
say
so
happily
with
a
long
breath
of
satisfaction
waited
all
my
life
to
see
that
i
looked
around
wildly
to
see
what
she
was
talking
about
and
there
stood
notre
dame
had
i
seen
it
no
too
many
picayune
cares
on
my
mind
but
i
looked
at
it
then
looked
as
though
it
were
the
first
time
ever
seen
it
and
then
there
are
the
rich
americans
who
want
to
buy
everything
and
do
buy
everything
and
go
away
and
the
kind
who
want
to
be
what
they
think
is
sophisticated
who
feel
it
really
worth
spending
your
life
learning
how
to
order
a
meal
with
the
right
manner
in
the
most
expensive
restaurants
in
every
city
and
to
know
how
to
find
the
horridest
that
do
dare
advertise
in
the
papers
and
that
the
people
of
the
country
never
go
to
see
and
then
the
other
kind
who
come
over
the
whole
family
of
them
and
go
to
register
at
the
new
york
herald
you
know
the
sort
jehoshaphat
jones
president
of
the
jones
farm
implement
company
of
broken
ridge
indiana
together
with
jones
miss
elizabeth
jones
miss
margaret
jones
and
master
jones
are
stopping
at
the
hotel
vouillemont
they
will
shortly
start
on
a
tour
of
the
château
country
and
after
that
expect
to
travel
in
switzerland
you
can
see
jones
cutting
that
notice
out
and
sending
it
home
to
broken
ridge
i
like
that
kind
when
they
do
get
too
tired
and
begin
to
snap
at
each
other
i
always
feel
such
a
deep
sympathy
for
jehoshaphat
when
i
see
him
dragging
his
sore
feet
around
over
a
hard
hard
museum
floor
and
such
a
sympathy
for
jones
when
he
makes
them
all
stand
around
at
an
alpine
railway
station
while
he
delightedly
figures
out
and
explains
how
the
funicular
works
there
were
times
when
she
ran
on
mirthful
flashing
keen
droll
amusing
herself
and
making
him
laugh
as
nothing
had
ever
made
him
laugh
before
out
of
sheer
hilarity
as
he
watched
her
talking
animatedly
in
her
beautiful
clearly
articulated
english
her
plastic
face
a
comic
mask
fooling
and
bantering
till
she
had
him
shouting
and
yet
with
that
core
of
shrewd
observation
and
real
intelligence
underlying
all
she
said
sometimes
he
remembered
with
a
start
his
first
sight
of
her
up
there
on
the
roof
what
was
the
meaning
of
that
unearthly
sadness
the
moon
had
shown
him
she
was
not
it
is
true
by
any
means
always
gay
on
these
stolen
talks
together
she
could
be
stern
and
brief
as
when
he
asked
her
challengingly
one
day
well
you
been
in
europe
all
your
life
nearly
what
have
got
out
of
it
she
answered
to
work
hard
and
not
to
expect
much
from
anything
except
from
music
her
face
that
was
sometimes
as
meltingly
soft
as
a
correggio
looked
dark
and
set
he
had
been
so
disconcerted
by
her
look
and
accent
that
like
the
lump
he
was
he
had
found
nothing
to
say
before
she
hailed
her
and
left
him
often
she
made
him
talk
talk
as
he
had
never
dreamed
of
talking
to
any
one
leading
him
on
to
flight
of
wordy
such
as
he
blushed
afterwards
to
remember
sure
that
he
must
have
bored
and
wearied
her
and
yet
there
never
was
such
a
listener
as
she
attentive
silent
except
for
just
the
occasional
comment
that
launched
him
off
on
further
talk
when
his
coming
warningly
forward
bade
him
stop
before
he
seemed
a
solemn
ass
she
made
him
intensely
desire
to
share
with
her
everything
that
was
in
his
mind
helpless
before
the
compelling
personal
look
with
which
she
listened
to
him
he
poured
it
all
out
what
he
had
been
struggling
to
lay
hold
of
ever
since
he
had
left
hoosick
junction
one
of
the
things
that
keeps
coming
over
me
is
the
variousness
of
folks
we
do
begin
to
take
enough
account
of
that
plants
now
they
various
too
sure
they
are
an
alpine
harebell
is
as
different
from
an
oleander
as
i
am
from
a
artist
but
everybody
that
has
any
sense
knows
that
an
oleander
would
freeze
and
starve
to
death
if
you
planted
it
up
near
a
glacier
you
can
tell
that
much
just
by
looking
at
it
but
you
ca
tell
a
thing
not
a
doggoned
about
a
human
being
just
by
looking
at
him
can
you
marise
agreed
with
intense
conviction
that
you
can
tell
less
than
nothing
by
looking
at
a
human
being
and
then
the
human
race
has
got
itself
so
mixed
up
there
is
the
slightest
chance
not
one
in
a
million
that
a
harebell
will
spring
up
in
a
roman
garden
and
be
burned
to
a
crisp
by
sunlight
that
just
makes
an
oleander
feel
good
and
comfortable
but
that
what
happens
the
whole
enduring
time
with
folks
why
i
wonder
cried
marise
with
a
startled
look
if
that
is
what
happened
to
me
i
know
it
what
happened
to
me
said
neale
i
believe
it
happens
to
lots
more
folks
than
have
any
idea
of
it
they
blame
it
on
the
climate
so
to
speak
but
the
climate
all
right
for
some
one
else
it
not
climate
that
all
let
start
out
on
a
hunt
for
our
climate
will
you
i
afraid
it
very
hard
to
make
a
guess
at
it
said
marise
soberly
but
making
no
comment
on
the
our
it
surely
is
it
terribly
hard
the
point
is
that
nobody
but
the
person
himself
can
make
any
sort
of
a
guess
at
it
and
it
awfully
hard
for
would
you
think
when
it
is
so
hard
under
the
best
of
circumstances
that
folks
would
try
to
teach
every
youngster
to
make
the
best
sort
of
guess
possible
as
to
where
he
really
belongs
but
they
never
give
you
any
hint
of
that
in
any
of
the
you
get
in
school
or
out
of
it
they
seem
to
be
in
mortal
terror
for
fear
you
will
find
it
out
yourself
they
jam
your
beak
down
on
the
and
hope
to
goodness
you
never
look
up
long
enough
to
see
that
only
your
own
foolishness
keeps
you
there
or
they
keep
you
there
till
you
tied
yourself
up
with
responsibilities
so
you
get
out
whatever
is
the
fashion
of
your
country
and
of
your
century
that
the
thing
for
you
to
do
whether
or
not
i
believe
that
what
europe
has
done
for
me
made
me
realize
that
our
present
fashion
is
foreordained
nor
the
only
one
natural
to
men
think
of
all
the
centuries
after
the
roman
bridges
went
down
when
people
got
along
without
bridges
because
no
provision
was
made
to
keep
alive
the
minds
that
happened
to
be
born
with
latent
constructive
powers
no
no
there
must
be
no
fooling
around
with
godless
abstract
mathematical
ideas
nor
fiddling
with
compasses
a
crucifix
or
a
sword
must
be
in
every
man
hand
every
man
must
be
a
fighter
or
a
saint
if
he
was
to
be
allowed
by
public
opinion
to
have
his
necessary
share
of
esteem
and
and
there
are
so
many
kinds
of
folks
besides
fighters
and
saints
century
after
century
they
died
without
having
lived
and
we
walking
around
over
their
dust
this
minute
and
yet
even
the
fighters
and
the
saints
needed
bridges
and
here
we
are
in
the
twentieth
century
jumping
the
life
out
of
anybody
who
is
interested
in
building
bridges
and
hooting
at
him
if
he
feels
the
impulse
to
try
to
be
a
saint
it
enough
to
make
you
tear
your
hair
out
by
handfuls
is
it
another
day
marise
launched
him
off
on
the
same
theme
by
asking
him
skeptically
well
suppose
you
could
have
your
own
way
about
things
what
would
you
do
to
help
people
find
their
own
right
group
and
work
and
climate
and
surroundings
i
do
see
how
there
is
the
faintest
possibility
of
helping
them
i
start
in
said
neale
by
suggesting
to
them
all
through
their
youth
in
every
way
possible
the
idea
that
folks
could
and
should
move
freely
from
the
life
they
born
to
to
another
one
that
suits
their
natures
they
have
to
do
it
while
they
young
and
they
i
would
start
in
by
hammering
them
over
the
head
with
the
idea
that
there
are
only
one
or
two
classes
that
anybody
wants
to
belong
to
i
jump
with
all
my
weight
on
that
idiotic
notion
that
one
class
is
better
than
another
as
if
any
class
was
any
good
at
all
for
you
if
it
not
the
one
you
belong
to
naturally
i
grease
the
ways
to
get
from
one
to
another
instead
of
building
fences
especially
if
the
change
would
mean
making
less
money
just
think
of
all
the
carpenters
and
mechanics
that
fall
by
chance
into
professors
families
or
millionaires
homes
they
never
get
any
chance
in
life
just
look
at
the
hullaballo
that
was
made
about
poor
old
tolstoi
wanting
the
simplicity
of
a
life
just
look
at
the
fiendishly
ingenious
obstacles
that
are
put
in
the
way
of
any
son
who
wants
the
culture
and
fineness
and
harmonious
living
that
got
so
on
tolstoi
nerves
and
look
even
tolstoi
was
just
as
bad
as
the
rest
because
happened
to
want
simplicity
and
a
hardy
open
life
he
start
on
the
warpath
to
drive
everybody
else
to
it
good
lord
why
try
to
hold
up
one
ideal
as
the
only
one
for
millions
of
men
who
have
a
million
various
capacities
and
ideals
and
tastes
they
enrich
the
world
like
a
garden
with
their
lives
if
public
opinion
only
allowed
them
to
be
lived
do
you
know
rabelais
asked
marise
and
his
motto
ce
que
everybody
in
his
day
thought
it
fearfully
immoral
oh
i
suppose
that
every
wise
man
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
has
found
it
out
in
his
way
before
now
but
they
not
allowed
to
tell
the
rest
of
us
plain
folks
so
we
understand
or
maybe
you
do
understand
anything
till
you
find
it
out
for
yourself
i
do
believe
i
do
do
you
i
sure
said
marise
with
a
quiet
bitterness
in
her
tone
that
burned
like
a
drop
of
acid
in
neale
mind
i
sure
that
i
personally
found
out
anything
nor
do
i
understand
anything
whatever
nor
till
this
minute
did
anybody
ever
suggest
to
me
that
there
was
really
something
worth
while
to
find
out
nobody
nobody
but
you
ever
dreamed
of
asking
me
to
go
on
a
quest
to
understand
that
why
i
go
on
go
on
with
it
why
do
you
stop
but
that
day
neale
had
been
too
much
startled
by
the
glimpse
of
a
somber
discontent
under
her
keen
bright
intelligence
and
too
much
moved
by
her
speaking
of
his
bringing
something
different
into
her
life
to
go
on
he
tried
desperately
to
think
of
some
way
to
ask
her
about
it
to
offer
to
help
her
to
implore
her
to
open
her
heart
as
he
was
opening
his
but
he
was
stricken
with
shyness
with
a
fear
lest
he
had
misunderstood
lest
he
say
the
wrong
thing
he
could
only
look
at
her
hopelessly
what
a
clumsy
he
was
anyhow
but
such
glimpses
of
what
lay
beneath
the
surface
did
not
come
often
though
he
thought
about
them
a
great
deal
he
wondered
if
there
was
any
connection
between
them
and
her
evident
habit
of
not
talking
seriously
of
bantering
keenly
about
superficial
things
rather
than
giving
any
idea
of
what
she
was
really
thinking
perhaps
she
did
not
trust
people
enough
to
give
them
any
idea
of
what
she
was
really
thinking
perhaps
she
fell
into
that
grim
mood
when
she
thought
seriously
why
should
she
and
yet
she
was
always
making
him
talk
seriously
about
ideas
he
really
cared
about
once
he
said
to
her
clumsily
i
must
bore
you
to
death
with
all
these
ideas
of
mine
when
you
used
to
such
brilliant
talkers
she
startled
him
with
the
energy
and
vivacity
of
her
answer
oh
i
what
you
call
brilliant
talkers
i
so
sick
of
them
you
imagine
what
it
is
to
me
like
a
long
drink
of
clear
water
to
hear
somebody
trying
to
say
what
he
really
thinks
he
asked
sincerely
and
naïvely
at
a
loss
why
why
does
anybody
talk
at
all
if
not
to
say
what
he
thinks
she
answered
with
a
certain
smile
of
hers
which
always
made
him
uneasy
a
dry
ugly
smile
do
you
realize
that
the
real
purpose
of
talk
is
to
pull
the
wool
over
the
eyes
of
the
person
you
are
talking
to
to
make
him
think
you
are
more
clever
than
you
are
and
to
get
something
out
of
him
for
yourself
that
he
would
not
let
you
have
if
he
knew
you
were
taking
it
then
with
one
of
her
lightning
changes
to
that
melting
look
and
smile
before
which
he
always
succumbed
wholly
she
went
on
the
truth
is
that
i
hope
all
the
time
that
in
your
thinking
over
and
over
there
may
be
a
hint
for
me
who
was
never
taught
to
do
the
least
bit
of
thinking
for
myself
so
go
on
let
me
see
it
all
just
as
it
comes
let
me
pick
out
for
myself
what
will
be
of
use
to
me
well
if
she
wanted
that
she
should
have
it
or
anything
else
he
could
give
her
it
was
part
of
the
reeling
glamorous
intoxication
into
which
she
cast
him
to
hear
himself
going
on
like
a
and
she
was
adroit
at
hitting
on
subjects
that
made
him
talk
one
day
as
they
were
amusing
each
other
by
describing
their
his
as
different
from
hers
as
if
they
had
been
brought
up
on
different
planets
football
was
mentioned
in
no
time
she
had
him
helplessly
loquacious
explaining
football
to
her
think
of
having
to
explain
football
to
anybody
he
explained
how
you
played
it
and
some
of
the
rules
and
how
terribly
you
cared
about
it
and
suddenly
found
that
he
had
explained
it
to
himself
that
he
really
understood
it
for
the
first
time
it
a
kind
of
education
that
america
has
worked
out
for
herself
unconsciously
i
believe
the
american
college
idea
of
sports
no
american
undergraduate
dreams
of
playing
to
amuse
himself
he
scorn
to
plays
to
that
the
american
idea
and
it
a
splendid
one
to
give
every
ounce
in
you
to
do
what
you
set
out
to
do
no
lackadaisical
dilettantism
your
whole
heart
in
it
and
to
that
the
way
for
men
to
live
he
was
aware
that
marise
looked
at
him
surprised
by
his
fire
he
was
surprised
by
it
himself
he
guessed
perhaps
he
was
ready
to
go
back
to
work
perhaps
he
had
enough
of
sauntering
around
that
what
you
learn
in
college
athletics
how
to
give
yourself
to
some
aim
and
not
to
keep
anything
back
for
yourself
that
great
you
know
he
told
her
imperatively
it
is
it
takes
the
personal
littleness
out
of
a
boy
to
give
his
all
to
reach
a
goal
it
makes
a
man
out
of
a
boy
but
oh
lord
he
burst
out
with
a
great
swing
of
his
arm
when
that
made
you
a
man
why
do
they
let
you
know
that
you
have
more
goals
to
choose
from
than
just
different
ways
of
making
your
living
most
of
them
just
buying
and
selling
different
sorts
of
things
you
trained
in
athletics
to
put
your
very
heart
and
all
of
it
into
what
you
do
but
why
do
they
train
you
just
as
hard
to
put
your
whole
intelligence
into
being
sure
that
what
you
putting
your
heart
into
is
worth
doing
and
is
what
you
meant
to
do
they
do
train
you
for
that
they
wo
even
let
you
have
a
quiet
minute
to
think
of
it
yourself
they
keep
you
up
in
the
air
all
the
time
whooping
it
up
about
your
duty
to
out
to
win
the
game
sure
any
man
that
got
blood
in
his
veins
wants
to
win
the
game
but
game
it
all
very
well
turning
a
boy
into
a
human
being
but
you
got
to
i
wonder
broke
in
marise
thoughtfully
i
wonder
what
might
turn
a
girl
into
a
human
being
and
then
before
neale
could
open
his
lips
she
blushed
shook
her
head
as
if
at
a
slip
on
her
part
and
said
quickly
oh
there
my
car
now
she
ran
out
to
take
it
neale
stood
on
the
corner
cursing
the
whole
race
of
when
it
passed
him
close
to
him
in
the
narrow
street
he
caught
sight
of
her
face
it
was
bent
downward
as
if
to
hide
it
from
the
other
people
in
the
car
he
saw
that
there
was
a
very
faint
smile
on
her
lips
as
if
she
could
not
keep
it
back
a
little
sweet
secret
happy
smile
her
whole
face
was
softly
shimmering
with
it
good
heavens
why
had
he
gone
on
with
her
he
leaped
forward
and
sprinted
after
the
rapidly
disappearing
car
and
stopped
short
in
the
midst
of
the
traffic
you
ca
make
love
in
a
what
an
imbecile
he
was
often
after
she
had
left
him
he
pelted
off
into
the
campagna
walking
for
miles
like
a
madman
said
the
leisurely
italian
countrymen
slowly
stepping
about
their
work
neale
felt
himself
rather
mad
as
though
the
steady
foundations
of
his
life
had
been
rent
and
shattered
as
by
a
blast
of
dynamite
dynamite
what
was
it
somebody
had
said
to
him
once
about
dynamite
he
tried
to
think
but
could
not
remember
perhaps
it
was
something
he
had
read
in
a
book
once
after
such
a
headlong
tramp
he
came
in
and
wrote
a
long
letter
to
his
mother
telling
her
all
about
marise
a
strange
thing
for
him
to
do
he
thought
as
he
dropped
the
letter
in
the
box
but
everything
he
did
now
seemed
strange
to
him
strange
and
yet
irresistibly
natural
chapter
xlix
if
only
marise
would
go
away
would
go
and
give
her
a
chance
thought
eugenia
despairingly
coming
slowly
into
her
where
mlle
vallet
sat
writing
in
her
journal
joséphine
heard
the
door
close
and
hurried
in
with
her
quick
silent
step
to
take
off
her
wraps
mademoiselle
looks
so
after
these
long
walks
she
said
solicitously
scrutinizing
with
a
professional
expertness
the
color
of
the
young
face
i
do
think
they
agree
with
mademoiselle
at
all
this
climate
is
too
soft
to
walk
about
so
nobody
does
mademoiselle
might
without
presuming
to
advise
mademoiselle
might
be
wiser
to
go
in
cabs
eugenia
held
out
her
arms
as
joséphine
slipped
off
her
pretty
silk
coat
and
then
let
them
fall
at
her
sides
she
was
thinking
what
would
he
say
to
some
one
who
went
everywhere
in
cabs
oh
cried
joséphine
those
abominable
ruins
mademoiselle
dear
little
bronze
shoes
cut
to
pieces
oh
mlle
vallet
just
look
at
our
poor
mademoiselle
shoes
the
beautiful
bronze
ones
and
there
no
replacing
them
in
the
shops
of
country
mlle
vallet
tipped
her
head
forward
to
look
seriously
over
her
spectacles
agreed
seriously
that
there
was
certainly
very
little
left
of
the
pretty
bronze
shoes
and
went
seriously
back
to
writing
with
her
sharp
steel
pen
a
detailed
description
of
her
expedition
to
the
catacombs
mlle
vallet
was
a
very
happy
woman
in
those
days
to
be
in
rome
after
years
of
grinding
drudgery
in
the
to
be
free
to
look
and
wander
and
observe
at
her
leisure
for
so
much
of
the
day
she
often
told
eugenia
that
she
had
never
in
her
wildest
dreams
supposed
she
would
have
such
an
opportunity
she
studied
and
with
conscientious
and
absorbed
exactitude
and
wrote
down
voluminous
accounts
of
every
day
sights
and
the
thoughts
they
aroused
in
her
it
will
be
the
of
my
old
age
she
said
i
shall
take
it
down
from
the
shelf
when
i
am
old
and
live
myself
back
into
this
wonderful
experience
her
old
age
eugenia
wondered
when
she
thought
old
age
would
begin
she
looked
a
thousand
years
old
already
to
eugenia
heavens
think
of
ever
being
old
like
that
yourself
what
use
there
be
in
living
if
you
were
old
and
reduced
for
your
amusement
to
writing
down
dates
and
things
in
a
journal
if
mademoiselle
will
step
into
her
own
room
said
joséphine
eugenia
came
to
herself
with
a
start
she
had
been
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
staring
at
mlle
vallet
back
but
she
had
been
thinking
about
neale
crittenden
about
those
eyes
of
his
and
how
his
face
was
lighted
up
when
he
smiled
when
he
smiled
at
her
eugenia
felt
like
moving
from
wherever
she
was
and
going
to
stand
close
beside
him
what
made
her
feel
so
it
was
like
a
there
was
that
girl
at
school
who
had
been
bewitched
by
the
breton
bewitched
so
that
she
fell
into
a
fever
if
she
could
not
see
him
every
day
there
sit
there
said
joséphine
pressing
her
competently
into
an
easy
chair
and
beginning
to
undo
her
hooks
and
eyes
i
have
much
time
mademoiselle
is
so
late
in
coming
in
just
a
little
this
horrible
southern
sun
burns
so
oh
i
can
feel
this
awful
roman
dust
thick
on
every
hair
i
do
wish
without
seeming
to
presume
i
do
that
mademoiselle
would
consent
to
wear
a
veil
everybody
does
eugenia
moved
her
head
from
one
side
to
the
other
wearily
how
joséphine
did
chatter
she
never
had
a
quiet
moment
and
she
was
so
feeling
the
supple
smooth
professional
fingers
beginning
to
put
on
the
cold
cream
she
held
her
head
still
and
thought
very
bitter
thoughts
and
bewildered
of
a
person
betrayed
she
betrayed
she
had
done
everything
everything
that
she
had
known
how
to
do
she
had
spared
neither
time
nor
money
nor
effort
she
had
worked
and
she
hated
to
work
she
had
to
learn
all
the
things
she
should
know
she
had
beaten
marise
at
her
own
game
she
talked
better
french
than
she
so
her
diction
teacher
said
and
ever
so
much
more
distinguished
english
she
made
those
slips
into
americanisms
or
gallicisms
that
marise
did
at
least
not
in
conversation
sometimes
she
still
thought
in
american
she
knew
ever
so
much
more
about
dressing
than
marise
and
about
lace
and
about
manners
she
had
come
to
the
point
at
last
of
being
sure
of
her
manners
of
being
able
to
sit
down
instinctively
composing
herself
so
that
she
would
look
well
from
all
angles
of
not
having
to
think
of
how
to
shake
hands
or
leave
a
room
any
more
than
she
thought
of
the
adjustment
of
a
gown
that
joséphine
had
put
on
her
whereas
marise
still
fumbled
at
the
back
of
her
neck
at
times
to
make
sure
of
a
hook
or
had
that
common
trick
of
feeling
her
hair
to
see
if
it
were
in
order
marise
had
stood
still
in
all
that
and
she
had
gone
forward
to
the
goal
but
as
she
reached
it
how
could
she
have
thought
for
a
moment
that
she
cared
a
thing
about
him
he
was
horrible
and
rough
and
as
american
as
as
a
typewriter
what
her
care
about
such
a
man
she
would
have
if
it
had
not
been
for
marise
it
was
marise
fault
she
never
would
have
dreamed
of
looking
at
him
if
she
had
seen
that
first
evening
at
donna
antonia
pierleoni
soirée
that
marise
had
lost
her
head
over
him
that
made
her
curious
about
him
of
course
and
somehow
before
she
knew
it
something
about
his
eyes
or
smile
oh
it
as
if
she
were
bewitched
that
he
should
make
her
feel
so
make
her
want
and
want
and
want
till
she
ached
to
have
him
look
at
her
and
all
the
time
he
never
looked
away
from
marise
there
said
joséphine
slipping
out
the
hairpins
and
taking
up
a
handful
of
the
bright
hair
to
inspect
it
i
believe
i
she
pondered
the
matter
profoundly
her
dark
sharp
intelligent
face
selflessly
focussed
on
the
problem
i
if
we
ought
to
wash
it
a
little
oftener
here
than
in
paris
there
is
more
dust
but
washing
it
takes
the
oil
out
so
perhaps
a
little
more
of
the
meylan
dressing
that
has
a
little
fine
oil
in
it
i
know
the
recipe
joséphine
knew
everything
there
was
to
know
about
and
about
how
to
use
them
she
adored
her
profession
and
adored
mlle
mills
for
being
such
a
beautiful
subject
there
were
times
when
she
had
pinned
the
last
shining
curl
in
place
put
the
last
breath
of
invisible
powder
on
the
rounded
young
white
neck
fastened
the
last
hook
in
the
exquisitely
fitting
gown
and
got
down
on
her
knees
to
straighten
the
gleaming
silk
of
the
fine
silk
stockings
when
she
wondered
what
she
had
done
to
deserve
such
good
fortune
she
often
watched
eugenia
out
of
the
door
as
tenderly
impersonally
proud
of
her
as
a
painter
of
his
canvas
as
a
patissier
of
his
tart
and
then
feeling
somewhat
worn
with
activity
and
emotion
stepped
back
took
off
her
corsets
got
into
the
rumpled
untidy
wrapper
which
was
her
personal
favorite
put
carpet
slippers
on
her
tired
feet
and
sat
down
with
a
novel
of
to
rest
eugenia
occasionally
thought
seeing
her
thus
that
never
was
allowed
to
relax
in
unpicturesque
ease
it
seemed
to
her
that
mlle
vallet
and
joséphine
were
the
ones
who
were
enjoying
rome
she
worked
so
hard
she
had
paid
the
full
price
and
somehow
the
coin
was
of
no
value
in
this
new
country
to
which
she
was
now
transported
where
she
had
not
wanted
to
come
from
which
she
would
give
anything
to
get
away
she
did
not
crittenden
she
never
had
liked
him
oh
why
would
he
just
once
look
at
her
and
see
what
was
there
instead
of
talking
over
her
head
that
queer
talk
of
his
she
put
on
her
loveliest
toilettes
things
that
made
joséphine
almost
weep
for
pleasure
while
marise
wore
that
same
old
gray
dress
day
after
day
she
ruined
her
bronze
shoes
for
him
stumbling
around
on
foot
over
those
horrible
old
ruins
how
she
loathed
ruins
why
on
earth
did
any
one
want
to
to
like
to
look
at
them
history
that
was
what
he
was
always
talking
about
history
that
she
had
always
hated
here
it
was
again
to
plague
her
how
could
she
have
guessed
that
he
would
care
about
history
she
sat
up
now
till
all
hours
reading
it
till
mlle
vallet
was
afraid
for
her
eyes
and
yet
he
seem
to
notice
when
she
said
something
about
it
he
just
took
it
for
granted
as
if
she
were
a
man
what
did
marise
of
him
anyhow
she
could
possibly
expect
to
him
neither
of
them
had
a
cent
of
money
she
ought
to
think
of
that
to
think
what
was
best
for
him
it
was
selfish
of
marise
a
man
like
neale
ought
of
course
to
marry
money
when
she
thought
what
could
do
for
him
married
to
her
he
could
have
exactly
the
life
he
was
meant
for
travel
leisure
ease
what
was
it
about
marise
that
he
liked
she
could
do
everything
better
than
marise
now
except
play
the
piano
and
it
evidently
was
he
cared
for
in
her
because
the
afternoon
they
had
all
gone
to
the
visconti
recital
he
had
listened
just
as
intently
to
the
men
students
and
the
other
girls
as
to
marise
and
when
marise
asked
him
afterwards
what
music
he
liked
best
he
told
her
bluntly
the
bach
that
professor
visconti
himself
had
played
and
marise
had
said
she
did
too
she
had
seemed
to
realize
what
an
affront
to
her
that
was
did
marise
care
so
much
about
him
why
did
anybody
eugenia
could
understand
she
understand
her
throat
had
a
hard
aching
lump
in
it
because
she
understand
a
loose
soft
coiffure
for
murmured
joséphine
dreamily
to
herself
happily
twisting
together
the
beautiful
golden
strands
and
the
mousseline
de
soie
not
the
she
was
shocked
at
the
idea
though
nobody
had
suggested
it
the
one
with
the
little
myosotis
embroidered
on
the
ruffles
joséphine
worshipped
that
dress
her
strong
dark
flexible
fingers
hovered
around
the
golden
head
as
though
she
were
calling
down
blessings
on
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
was
she
slipped
off
the
silk
peignoir
washed
with
water
the
white
arms
and
neck
and
the
white
tired
feet
she
dried
them
with
a
fine
linen
towel
by
gentle
pattings
not
to
coarsen
the
skin
she
put
on
the
white
silk
stockings
and
white
slippers
and
a
white
satin
underslip
she
stood
a
moment
to
be
sure
she
had
thought
of
everything
then
carefully
carefully
she
slipped
on
the
pale
blue
it
as
sweet
as
she
remembered
it
eugenia
had
submitted
to
all
this
with
a
forlorn
patience
that
was
all
the
good
it
would
do
he
would
look
at
her
as
if
she
were
dressed
in
a
never
even
notice
that
she
had
changed
her
dress
what
could
she
do
could
any
one
do
what
more
did
he
want
she
was
betrayed
somehow
life
had
played
her
false
a
callous
heartless
dishonest
trick
why
she
care
so
much
she
did
want
to
care
why
did
she
long
to
have
him
look
kindly
at
her
till
her
heart
ached
why
every
day
every
day
should
the
disappointment
her
so
she
had
done
anything
wrong
to
deserve
to
be
hurt
so
if
she
could
only
stop
caring
if
only
marise
would
go
away
eugenia
sat
very
still
while
joséphine
set
a
jeweled
comb
at
exactly
the
right
angle
in
the
golden
hair
one
lovely
little
hand
was
at
her
heart
as
if
by
pressing
hard
on
it
she
could
stop
the
ache
the
other
held
the
fresh
scented
handkerchief
clutched
tightly
in
case
this
time
she
could
not
keep
back
the
tears
she
must
cry
she
must
cry
because
joséphine
would
have
to
do
her
face
all
over
chapter
l
one
night
marise
woke
up
with
a
start
staring
into
the
darkness
feeling
very
cold
and
sick
she
knew
what
had
happened
she
had
come
to
her
senses
in
time
she
had
almost
slipped
into
the
trap
the
trap
set
for
her
by
life
which
she
had
so
mortally
feared
she
had
been
playing
a
foolish
reckless
game
of
with
herself
pretending
that
she
did
not
know
what
was
happening
she
knew
perfectly
well
what
was
happening
neale
crittenden
was
in
love
with
her
and
she
was
falling
in
love
with
him
she
wanted
him
oh
this
was
the
way
it
must
always
happen
this
was
the
way
all
women
were
caught
in
the
trap
these
dizzying
moments
of
joy
this
causeless
singing
of
your
heart
this
blind
rapturous
rushing
forward
with
outstretched
arms
to
clasp
all
life
to
your
heart
treacherous
deadly
life
that
only
sought
to
debase
you
she
had
always
wondered
how
women
could
go
on
go
on
to
the
fatal
moment
from
which
there
was
no
drawing
back
now
she
knew
you
were
poisoned
you
were
made
mad
till
you
longed
for
that
moment
with
all
your
being
but
she
had
come
to
her
senses
in
time
to
draw
back
she
would
save
herself
defend
herself
since
there
was
no
one
to
help
her
now
more
than
ever
first
of
all
she
knew
passionately
she
must
not
think
of
him
for
a
moment
or
she
would
not
draw
back
she
must
not
remember
how
he
looked
or
spoke
or
moved
not
even
the
sound
of
his
voice
she
must
concentrate
her
thoughts
on
the
one
fact
that
she
had
almost
been
caught
in
that
great
dreadful
trap
that
she
marise
who
knew
so
much
better
had
almost
fallen
in
love
love
she
drew
the
covers
about
her
as
she
sat
in
the
dark
her
teeth
chattering
love
she
sickened
at
the
sound
the
gray
cat
jeanne
isabelle
the
pictures
in
one
of
the
hidden
books
at
school
the
passages
in
her
mother
novels
her
mother
madame
vallery
madame
de
la
cueva
they
were
all
of
them
looking
at
her
out
of
the
dark
pointing
at
her
shaming
her
exulting
over
her
you
too
you
have
come
to
it
the
gray
cat
she
was
like
the
gray
cat
she
began
to
sob
hysterically
and
thrust
the
covers
into
her
mouth
to
smother
the
sound
what
could
she
do
what
could
she
do
she
had
no
strength
left
she
did
not
know
how
to
defend
herself
she
did
not
want
to
defend
herself
she
could
run
away
even
poor
defenseless
things
could
run
away
she
stopped
sobbing
and
sprang
out
of
bed
lighting
her
candle
with
trembling
fingers
her
watch
showed
three
in
the
morning
there
was
a
railroad
down
in
the
dining
room
she
huddled
on
her
wrapper
thrust
her
feet
into
slippers
and
shading
her
crept
downstairs
at
five
hatted
and
cloaked
she
was
gently
shaking
eugenia
and
saying
i
so
sorry
to
bother
you
but
do
you
happen
to
have
some
money
on
hand
i
been
worrying
about
father
for
some
time
it
so
long
since
i
been
back
to
straighten
out
the
household
for
him
i
just
decided
to
get
off
on
the
early
morning
train
i
ought
to
go
to
see
jeanne
too
it
past
my
regular
time
for
making
her
a
visit
if
you
could
just
loan
me
enough
to
buy
the
ticket
to
paris
i
almost
enough
as
it
is
but
i
must
leave
some
for
miss
oldham
and
my
how
kind
eugenia
had
been
how
discreet
and
uninquisitive
she
reached
under
her
pillow
pulled
out
her
purse
with
the
ridiculously
large
sum
in
cash
she
always
carried
with
her
and
gave
her
a
note
together
with
a
kiss
on
each
cheek
when
will
you
be
back
marise
oh
i
do
know
i
do
know
quite
a
long
time
i
may
i
shall
probably
not
come
back
at
all
it
wo
be
worth
while
mme
de
la
cueva
will
soon
be
in
paris
again
eugenia
dear
you
be
soon
coming
north
too
wo
you
oh
i
dare
say
said
eugenia
if
it
gets
too
hot
here
going
down
the
hall
silent
and
empty
in
the
dawn
marise
stopped
for
an
instant
before
his
door
for
an
instant
she
was
forced
to
think
of
him
the
thought
like
a
weakening
potion
she
stared
hard
at
his
door
her
hands
pressed
tightly
together
trembling
from
head
to
foot
she
was
going
away
she
would
never
see
him
again
she
turned
back
towards
her
own
room
she
could
not
go
she
ran
desperately
down
the
stairs
sick
at
the
idea
of
what
love
is
she
had
almost
been
caught
she
heard
the
steel
jaws
snap
shut
as
she
fled
chapter
li
yes
said
eugenia
at
the
breakfast
table
marise
was
suddenly
called
back
to
france
by
family
matters
she
is
her
widowed
housekeeper
you
know
and
then
too
there
is
an
old
servant
somewhere
who
brought
her
up
whom
she
feels
it
her
duty
to
go
to
see
every
once
in
a
while
what
her
address
in
paris
asked
crittenden
urgently
i
can
give
that
to
you
but
if
you
thinking
of
writing
her
a
card
it
would
reach
her
for
she
was
to
go
directly
on
to
the
south
and
i
have
the
least
idea
what
address
is
some
tiny
village
on
the
i
believe
or
is
it
in
the
pyrenees
but
she
will
be
back
very
soon
almost
any
day
it
hardly
worth
while
trying
to
write
her
she
be
here
before
a
card
could
follow
her
around
crittenden
got
up
leaving
his
coffee
untouched
and
left
the
in
his
unceremonious
american
way
without
a
sign
of
decent
civility
livingstone
looked
at
miss
mills
eloquently
with
a
shrug
which
meant
what
can
you
expect
eugenia
waited
till
every
one
except
herself
and
livingstone
had
left
the
room
and
then
said
hesitatingly
livingstone
i
wonder
he
was
on
the
alert
in
an
instant
surprised
at
her
personal
manner
it
an
outrageously
big
favor
to
ask
of
you
but
i
do
know
any
one
else
adroit
enough
to
manage
it
she
paused
reflected
and
drew
back
shaking
her
head
oh
no
no
what
am
i
thinking
of
by
this
time
livingstone
was
in
the
chair
beside
her
assuring
her
warmly
that
if
there
was
anything
he
could
do
to
be
of
service
i
shall
consider
it
an
honor
miss
mills
i
assure
you
an
miss
mills
let
her
blue
eyes
rest
on
his
deeply
as
if
sounding
the
depths
of
his
sincerity
and
then
with
a
yielding
gesture
of
abandon
decided
to
trust
him
i
been
foolish
and
i
so
afraid
i
shall
have
trouble
unless
you
can
help
me
promise
me
you
wo
tell
mlle
vallet
or
one
impassioned
protestations
from
livingstone
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
to
be
sure
they
were
alone
you
know
the
rule
of
the
italian
government
about
taking
out
of
italy
any
valuable
antiquities
they
are
so
afraid
that
tourists
of
means
will
carry
off
some
of
the
fragments
of
greek
and
roman
sculpture
i
about
it
of
course
but
i
no
idea
it
was
really
enforced
those
things
so
seldom
are
in
europe
and
i
bought
a
lovely
little
antique
to
go
over
a
in
my
paris
apartment
i
had
it
sent
yesterday
up
by
the
simplon
route
it
too
late
to
get
it
back
and
now
i
in
mortal
terror
of
what
may
happen
at
the
italian
frontier
i
heard
last
night
the
most
dreadful
tales
of
what
they
do
to
any
one
who
tries
to
smuggle
out
such
things
not
only
fines
you
know
but
lawsuits
lawyers
to
frighten
you
she
looked
very
pale
and
anxious
as
she
explained
all
this
so
that
livingstone
was
deeply
touched
but
he
wondered
what
she
thought
he
could
do
about
it
i
really
ashamed
now
i
come
to
the
point
to
ask
you
what
i
thought
but
i
and
if
you
think
it
too
preposterous
more
than
i
have
any
right
to
it
this
to
take
a
pocket
full
of
money
i
care
it
costs
and
go
up
to
the
frontier
station
and
when
it
comes
along
bribe
it
through
the
inspectors
you
see
livingstone
it
something
that
not
everybody
could
manage
even
with
ever
so
much
money
but
you
understand
the
european
mentality
so
perfectly
it
would
need
to
be
done
with
just
the
right
manner
oh
no
she
broke
off
abruptly
getting
up
from
her
chair
what
a
thing
to
dream
of
asking
any
one
to
do
what
claim
have
i
on
your
livingstone
blinking
joyfully
sprang
up
too
protesting
that
nothing
would
amuse
and
interest
him
more
than
such
a
mission
and
for
any
mission
would
be
his
joy
well
think
it
over
let
me
know
i
ashamed
to
have
mentioned
it
she
said
in
confusion
i
do
know
how
i
dared
but
oh
livingstone
i
am
so
troubled
about
it
and
i
am
so
alone
no
one
on
whom
to
she
had
gone
murmuring
apologies
touched
by
his
instant
response
leaving
livingstone
as
much
moved
and
agitated
as
she
she
went
through
into
her
own
rooms
and
told
joséphine
put
those
manicure
things
away
for
the
time
being
i
must
go
out
to
do
a
bit
of
shopping
but
you
can
have
them
ready
at
ten
i
be
back
by
that
time
it
wo
take
me
long
neale
stood
frowning
and
looking
at
his
watch
waiting
for
eugenia
to
come
down
from
the
ladies
and
have
dinner
as
he
fidgeted
about
looking
glumly
at
the
brilliant
scene
about
him
he
was
wondering
with
inward
oaths
of
exasperation
what
in
hell
could
be
the
matter
with
anybody
clothes
and
hair
after
the
slight
exertion
of
sitting
perfectly
still
in
a
cab
from
the
door
of
the
pension
to
the
door
of
the
restaurant
it
was
not
god
knew
that
he
was
impatient
to
have
her
join
him
it
was
because
he
was
in
a
steady
fever
of
impatience
to
have
everything
over
the
evening
the
day
the
night
to
put
back
of
him
another
of
those
endless
endless
days
to
be
one
day
nearer
to
the
time
when
marise
would
return
he
said
irritably
to
the
waiter
who
now
approached
him
with
an
intimate
manner
oh
do
care
which
table
here
sir
is
one
right
by
the
edge
of
the
terrace
where
the
view
is
finest
said
the
waiter
in
excellent
english
perhaps
the
lady
would
like
a
screen
there
is
occasionally
a
draught
from
below
he
hastened
to
set
a
small
screen
to
rearrange
fussily
the
handsome
silver
and
linen
on
the
table
to
slant
the
single
fine
rose
in
the
vase
at
another
angle
another
waiter
also
impeccably
polyglot
with
gleaming
hair
admirably
cut
clothes
and
an
insinuating
manner
now
murmured
in
neale
ear
what
wine
sir
neale
answered
on
a
mounting
note
of
irritation
oh
i
do
what
wine
we
have
an
excellent
frascati
sir
that
is
our
specialty
not
found
everywhere
sir
the
ladies
usually
like
it
or
all
right
serve
that
said
neale
adding
to
himself
unreasonably
if
you
knew
so
well
why
bother
me
about
it
the
real
waiter
in
charge
of
his
table
now
arrived
in
all
his
majesty
the
first
one
having
been
but
an
aide
neale
saw
by
the
earnest
expression
in
his
eyes
that
he
intended
to
make
their
conference
a
serious
one
and
cut
him
short
as
he
began
to
call
over
the
possibilities
of
the
menu
by
a
repeated
all
right
that
do
before
he
had
had
time
to
do
more
than
mention
one
sort
of
fish
or
one
entree
or
one
variety
of
fowl
there
over
he
said
to
himself
with
a
long
breath
of
relief
as
the
pained
waiter
turned
away
to
carry
into
execution
that
brutally
impromptu
order
eugenia
arrived
now
followed
by
a
little
stir
all
over
the
restaurant
as
people
turned
to
pay
tribute
to
her
beauty
and
her
toilette
he
ca
help
noticing
she
thought
happily
her
pride
and
satisfaction
showing
itself
only
in
an
increase
of
the
perfectly
unconscious
naturalness
with
which
she
took
her
seat
oh
what
a
beautiful
view
she
said
in
a
low
tone
to
neale
looking
down
over
the
cypresses
of
the
palatine
to
the
city
like
a
heap
of
uncut
jewels
dully
deeply
colored
under
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
you
know
how
to
choose
a
table
i
see
she
added
admiringly
in
an
intimate
tone
she
wondered
if
perhaps
he
had
come
out
in
the
afternoon
to
reserve
it
she
noticed
the
screen
now
and
looked
at
him
gratefully
really
touched
the
waiter
arrived
with
the
soup
yes
it
is
a
fine
view
said
neale
rousing
himself
a
very
fine
view
indeed
that
the
colosseum
over
there
is
it
yes
said
eugenia
and
that
the
arch
of
titus
that
the
one
with
the
awfully
bad
is
it
said
neale
oh
corrected
eugenia
the
one
with
the
poor
sculptures
is
the
arch
of
septimius
severus
the
arch
of
titus
is
the
one
you
know
with
the
of
the
hebrews
oh
yes
of
course
you
right
admitted
neale
eugenia
thought
to
herself
triumphantly
ah
it
not
only
marise
who
can
talk
history
with
him
she
was
very
happy
happier
than
she
ever
remembered
feeling
everything
had
played
into
her
hands
everything
was
going
perfectly
she
had
succeeded
in
getting
him
into
just
the
sort
of
restaurant
where
she
could
show
to
the
best
advantage
she
was
eating
her
soup
with
a
lively
appreciation
of
its
excellence
and
found
herself
perfectly
able
to
keep
up
an
artistic
and
historic
conversation
with
neale
but
she
was
also
acutely
aware
through
the
pores
of
her
skin
that
every
woman
around
her
was
jealously
scrutinizing
her
costume
she
expanded
joyously
like
a
cut
flower
set
in
water
how
everything
was
going
certainly
neale
must
be
aware
how
he
was
being
envied
she
made
a
remark
about
the
style
of
the
gigantic
statues
on
john
lateran
visible
in
the
distance
and
turned
her
arm
slightly
so
that
her
sleeve
would
hang
better
neale
answered
the
remark
about
the
statues
on
john
lateran
and
continued
to
look
in
that
direction
as
though
he
were
thinking
about
them
he
was
saying
to
himself
five
days
since
she
left
only
five
days
god
how
am
i
going
to
live
through
any
more
of
them
how
many
more
sleepless
nights
will
she
ever
get
back
yes
is
it
warm
said
eugenia
seeing
that
he
was
wiping
his
wet
forehead
with
his
handkerchief
unseasonable
very
agreed
neale
he
had
turned
sick
with
his
recurrent
panic
lest
she
come
back
he
ought
to
have
taken
that
next
train
and
gone
right
after
her
as
he
wanted
to
the
waiter
brought
the
fish
it
was
not
what
neale
had
ordered
but
a
more
expensive
variety
he
looked
somewhat
apprehensively
at
the
gentleman
as
he
offered
it
but
the
gentleman
did
not
seem
to
notice
on
this
the
waiter
disappeared
and
brought
back
a
bottle
of
wine
not
the
variety
neale
had
bargained
for
have
you
any
news
from
miss
allen
asked
neale
oh
no
said
eugenia
slightly
surprised
when
she
coming
back
so
soon
she
probably
does
see
there
any
need
to
write
she
began
on
the
fish
after
the
first
mouthful
she
said
to
neale
with
enthusiasm
you
know
how
to
order
a
dinner
as
well
as
to
choose
a
table
that
evident
it
was
the
first
fish
he
proposed
said
neale
eugenia
thought
how
much
better
breeding
he
has
after
all
than
livingstone
always
boasting
of
his
neale
thoughts
were
jumping
incoherently
from
one
thing
to
another
funny
place
rome
is
to
be
planning
how
to
run
a
plant
in
vermont
funny
change
of
direction
from
planning
to
go
out
to
china
and
the
east
to
planning
to
settle
down
and
take
root
you
would
think
that
would
appeal
to
a
man
who
had
had
the
idea
of
ranging
the
world
a
while
longer
to
tie
himself
this
attempt
at
reasonable
consideration
of
things
vanished
in
an
explosion
of
emotion
as
if
a
spark
had
fallen
into
gunpowder
oh
if
she
if
she
why
did
i
make
a
chance
to
see
her
alone
before
she
went
away
eugenia
was
talking
about
traveling
she
had
noticed
neale
interest
in
travels
i
thinking
crittenden
of
making
a
leisurely
trip
around
the
world
not
one
of
those
detestable
herded
conducted
tours
and
yet
how
else
can
i
go
about
it
what
would
do
i
so
ignorant
of
anything
outside
of
europe
i
i
had
some
one
intelligent
and
enlightened
to
go
with
me
it
so
forlorn
to
travel
alone
why
you
traveling
alone
said
neale
reassuringly
thinking
of
his
own
past
year
it
great
not
to
have
to
bother
with
some
else
tastes
and
notions
and
foolishness
and
limitations
oh
but
said
eugenia
looking
down
at
her
wineglass
pensively
of
course
it
better
to
be
alone
than
with
some
one
whose
tastes
and
interests
are
nothing
to
you
but
to
have
with
you
some
one
you
really
for
neale
thought
suddenly
what
the
past
year
would
have
been
if
he
had
had
marise
with
him
and
cried
out
fervently
oh
of
course
would
be
the
ideal
the
waiter
brought
the
roast
and
the
frascati
and
still
the
gentleman
made
no
objection
well
he
would
bring
a
cordial
with
the
coffee
ordered
or
not
the
gentleman
did
seem
to
know
what
he
had
ordered
or
what
he
was
eating
and
no
wonder
with
such
a
beautiful
girl
across
the
table
the
waiter
shot
an
experienced
appraising
eye
at
clothes
he
ought
to
be
good
for
a
big
tip
he
reflected
hopefully
eugenia
thought
best
to
leave
a
thoughtful
silence
after
the
remarks
on
companionship
in
travel
and
sipped
her
wine
with
downcast
eyes
neale
was
trying
again
to
think
things
over
reasonably
trying
to
do
as
he
had
always
done
about
everything
to
get
things
clear
and
straight
and
sure
in
his
head
there
must
be
no
possibility
of
a
mistake
where
marise
was
concerned
how
this
now
i
gone
stale
on
other
things
how
do
i
know
i
wo
have
a
slump
some
time
later
a
human
being
is
so
full
of
such
damn
unexpected
things
i
must
be
for
marise
sake
how
can
any
man
be
at
this
he
was
shaken
by
so
terrible
a
throe
of
desire
of
longing
for
marise
that
he
was
frightened
he
sat
pale
breathless
helpless
before
it
suffering
tortured
exalted
when
he
could
breathe
he
wiped
his
forehead
again
his
fingers
were
shaking
he
would
go
out
of
his
mind
if
she
did
come
back
soon
his
need
for
her
was
like
a
man
need
for
air
and
food
and
water
and
sleep
think
reasonably
about
such
essential
needs
as
that
a
man
can
not
live
without
them
he
could
not
live
without
marise
he
had
not
lived
before
he
knew
her
how
moved
he
is
thought
eugenia
seeing
his
pale
shaken
look
but
he
does
dare
speak
he
will
or
the
day
afterwards
the
waiter
brought
the
dessert
also
coffee
with
the
unordered
cordial
chapter
lii
father
had
grown
stouter
he
always
did
but
he
looked
very
well
and
his
shirts
and
socks
seemed
to
be
all
right
mélanie
had
seen
to
them
although
the
dust
was
thick
all
over
the
furniture
and
the
windows
were
with
smoke
father
was
glad
to
see
her
said
she
was
looking
very
pretty
and
asked
her
kindly
if
she
did
need
some
more
money
but
he
was
not
in
the
least
enthusiastic
over
her
reforms
in
the
housekeeping
who
cares
about
dust
he
told
her
and
as
for
smoke
on
the
windows
i
never
here
in
the
daytime
anyhow
except
for
lunch
and
i
do
want
to
look
out
of
the
windows
then
and
as
for
getting
hold
of
biron
to
keep
him
up
to
the
mark
marise
found
that
it
was
trying
to
put
your
finger
between
the
tree
and
the
bark
to
get
between
biron
and
her
father
every
evening
after
they
had
both
earnestly
finished
the
serious
business
of
eating
dinner
biron
left
mélanie
to
the
mere
brute
labor
of
cleaning
up
and
washing
dishes
while
he
put
on
a
clean
apron
and
came
into
the
salon
to
consult
with
his
employer
about
the
two
meals
of
the
morrow
marise
was
astonished
at
the
learning
and
acumen
displayed
by
both
of
them
in
the
matter
however
had
her
father
learned
so
intimately
all
the
resources
of
les
halles
in
all
the
seasons
he
subscribed
to
a
newspaper
which
gave
a
complete
report
of
the
arrivals
at
the
market
from
both
and
over
which
he
and
biron
pored
intently
putting
on
round
spectacles
and
bending
their
portly
frames
over
the
page
and
there
was
a
journal
too
the
news
items
of
which
were
brought
up
for
consideration
once
a
week
it
fails
i
go
out
and
run
a
mile
and
then
i
can
eat
mélanie
was
no
longer
allowed
to
serve
the
meals
thus
prayerfully
planned
and
created
it
was
biron
himself
who
brought
in
the
set
it
down
and
waited
anxiously
till
it
had
been
tasted
and
the
verdict
pronounced
he
did
not
sit
down
opposite
his
master
and
share
the
meal
not
yet
but
marise
had
an
intuition
that
it
would
not
be
long
before
he
would
why
not
he
was
the
only
other
person
capable
of
appreciating
that
meal
he
and
her
father
were
bound
together
by
a
common
passion
they
completed
and
rounded
out
each
other
lives
where
else
could
allen
find
such
another
cook
where
else
could
biron
find
another
such
employer
they
were
of
a
common
cult
they
might
be
thankful
that
somehow
they
had
found
each
other
in
the
world
when
after
a
few
days
of
sharing
this
ménage
she
told
her
father
she
thought
she
would
go
down
to
see
jeanne
he
said
sure
that
was
all
right
if
she
felt
like
it
and
was
she
sure
she
did
need
any
more
money
under
the
thick
green
shade
of
pollarded
sycamores
sat
old
jeanne
in
the
marise
and
her
father
had
given
her
the
young
girl
whom
marise
and
her
father
paid
to
take
care
of
jeanne
came
running
to
unlock
the
gate
and
let
the
visitor
in
there
was
old
jeanne
her
head
tied
up
in
the
black
coif
just
as
marise
had
seen
her
a
thousand
times
her
face
all
twisted
to
one
side
just
as
she
had
seen
her
that
one
time
she
could
not
forget
and
how
glad
she
was
to
see
marise
pulling
her
down
to
kiss
her
on
both
cheeks
crying
a
little
for
joy
and
wiping
away
the
tears
with
her
one
active
hand
for
although
she
had
recovered
somewhat
so
that
she
could
eat
and
talk
a
little
if
she
formed
the
words
very
slowly
and
was
not
excited
she
had
never
been
able
to
use
her
paralyzed
arm
or
leg
again
marise
must
sit
beside
her
and
let
old
jeanne
look
into
her
face
closely
with
her
loving
old
eyes
and
stroke
her
white
young
hand
with
her
gnarled
fingers
that
had
worked
so
hard
for
the
child
marise
and
when
her
first
agitation
was
over
and
she
was
calm
enough
to
try
to
talk
the
questions
the
loving
anxious
questions
was
she
well
the
darling
darling
girl
and
was
she
happy
and
did
that
parisian
slut
of
a
maid
look
out
for
her
decently
and
who
did
the
marketing
and
who
did
her
hair
her
beautiful
beautiful
hair
jeanne
brown
hand
rested
lightly
on
the
shining
dark
head
no
one
had
hair
like
her
marise
she
must
let
it
down
so
that
jeanne
could
see
it
again
as
in
the
old
days
and
how
about
her
linen
jeanne
was
troubled
on
this
point
linen
was
not
what
it
had
been
and
the
way
it
was
washed
in
paris
was
a
crime
a
parisian
family
were
staying
near
by
and
jeanne
did
their
washing
such
grimy
gray
linen
it
made
jeanne
sick
to
think
that
perhaps
her
darling
was
no
better
cared
for
marise
must
needs
open
her
valise
there
and
then
and
take
out
a
chemise
to
show
jeanne
who
handled
it
held
it
close
to
her
one
good
eye
touched
the
tip
of
her
tongue
to
it
and
gave
it
back
saying
with
an
attempt
at
tolerance
oh
well
it
as
good
as
a
laundress
can
do
nowadays
i
dare
say
and
possessed
herself
of
marise
hand
again
holding
it
to
her
heart
fondly
marise
found
the
tears
were
in
her
eyes
how
sweet
it
was
to
be
loved
she
clung
to
the
old
hand
as
she
had
when
she
was
a
child
and
had
been
the
only
hand
held
out
to
her
the
old
crafty
wrinkles
came
around
jeanne
eyes
she
pulled
head
close
to
her
and
whispered
you
never
told
nobody
at
all
no
no
said
marise
hastily
no
one
she
felt
the
old
sickness
rise
to
her
throat
as
she
said
it
and
you
not
no
man
you
not
engaged
or
no
oh
no
said
marise
still
more
hastily
jeanne
face
quieted
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
stroked
marise
hand
that
right
that
right
they
all
alike
my
darling
do
forget
that
they
all
alike
when
it
comes
to
women
next
morning
marise
was
amazed
to
have
jeanne
greet
her
all
over
again
as
though
she
had
not
seen
her
with
fresh
surprise
and
joy
the
same
questions
the
same
trembling
stroking
of
her
hair
only
why
was
her
hair
up
on
her
head
that
must
be
just
a
joke
she
must
be
playing
being
a
lady
and
was
she
sure
she
knew
her
catechism
her
white
veil
was
ready
finer
than
any
other
little
girl
veil
how
lovely
she
would
look
in
it
yes
whispered
the
young
caretaker
in
answer
to
marise
look
of
bewilderment
she
does
remember
you
were
here
yesterday
she
often
imagines
you
are
with
her
when
she
is
quite
alone
we
hear
her
talking
happily
to
you
and
now
she
does
not
know
the
difference
between
you
and
her
own
daughter
who
died
no
she
will
never
know
if
you
just
slip
away
now
she
will
never
know
that
you
came
or
that
you
are
not
still
here
when
marise
went
quietly
out
at
the
gate
she
left
jeanne
dozing
in
her
chair
under
the
dozing
and
waking
to
talk
lovingly
to
the
two
little
girls
who
had
both
died
so
long
ago
she
had
learned
in
the
village
that
mlle
hasparren
was
no
longer
teaching
in
bayonne
had
gone
back
to
her
own
little
in
the
pyrenees
marise
knew
the
way
there
very
well
having
spent
many
a
and
vacation
with
mlle
hasparren
in
the
old
days
the
boy
from
the
farm
where
jeanne
was
living
chanced
to
have
an
errand
that
took
him
over
the
pass
and
down
into
that
valley
on
an
impulse
marise
asked
to
go
with
him
she
stowed
her
valise
away
under
the
plank
seat
and
scrambled
up
beside
the
boy
in
the
blue
béret
how
it
all
took
her
back
to
her
childhood
the
little
cart
flew
off
behind
the
swift
small
horse
rattling
and
jolting
up
hill
and
down
just
as
when
she
and
mlle
hasparren
had
gone
off
together
at
the
beginning
of
the
long
steep
road
up
to
the
divide
she
and
the
boy
got
out
and
walked
her
shoes
soon
powdered
white
with
dust
how
dusty
mlle
hasparren
shoes
had
been
the
day
they
stood
waiting
in
the
station
they
plunged
down
the
other
side
into
the
green
valley
with
every
home
every
turn
of
the
road
as
it
had
been
they
stopped
at
the
tiny
cabin
with
its
leafy
atrium
of
sycamores
as
the
boy
drove
away
and
the
sound
of
his
rattling
wheels
died
to
silence
marise
heard
from
within
the
first
notes
of
the
sonata
in
g
the
one
she
had
first
studied
with
mlle
hasparren
she
went
in
without
knocking
sure
that
the
little
home
contained
no
servant
and
there
sat
mlle
hasparren
her
hair
several
shades
whiter
her
black
dress
several
degrees
shabbier
her
quiet
worn
face
and
steady
eyes
bent
lovingly
over
the
keys
the
music
was
like
the
very
sound
of
her
voice
they
sat
up
late
that
night
talking
marise
must
tell
all
about
rome
and
the
old
visconti
as
legendary
a
figure
to
mlle
hasparren
as
paganini
and
mlle
hasparren
must
tell
how
she
came
to
leave
her
and
go
back
to
the
little
mountaineers
in
the
rough
plain
village
i
seemed
to
feel
nearer
to
them
she
said
not
knowing
very
well
how
to
tell
why
she
had
and
i
felt
a
great
longing
for
my
mountains
and
my
own
old
home
and
they
need
music
here
do
you
remember
father
armandariz
oh
yes
marise
nodded
she
had
never
forgotten
the
lean
young
priest
who
led
the
singing
of
his
improvised
chorus
in
front
of
his
old
church
oh
yes
do
you
remember
we
used
to
drive
over
just
to
hear
his
choir
sing
here
and
in
another
parish
too
he
is
doing
wonderful
work
we
work
together
a
great
deal
you
with
a
curé
marise
was
astounded
mlle
hasparren
laughed
oh
yes
yes
those
radical
ideas
of
mine
of
course
i
still
have
them
but
they
do
seem
so
important
as
they
did
father
armandariz
and
i
are
good
friends
we
both
love
music
enough
he
puts
cotton
in
his
ears
when
i
let
fall
a
heresy
and
i
dip
my
fingers
in
the
font
and
cross
myself
when
i
go
to
play
the
organ
in
church
those
are
little
things
and
little
things
must
be
allowed
to
interfere
with
great
ones
that
evening
marise
watched
a
choir
rehearsal
mlle
hasparren
at
her
piano
father
armandariz
bony
threadbare
his
eyes
gleaming
with
ardor
leading
now
the
group
of
basque
girls
in
black
mantillas
now
the
burly
basque
men
whose
resonant
basses
shook
the
little
house
one
of
them
mlle
hasparren
had
said
he
was
the
village
shoemaker
was
given
a
bass
solo
and
practised
it
over
several
times
while
the
others
listened
he
held
his
head
high
drew
in
a
great
breath
and
sang
as
though
it
were
the
meaning
of
his
life
he
were
singing
out
magnificat
anima
mea
dominum
and
then
all
the
others
with
him
my
soul
magnifies
god
father
armandariz
stopped
them
no
the
altos
were
too
slow
on
coming
in
once
more
and
then
again
once
more
they
all
kept
their
eyes
on
him
earnestly
they
began
again
unfalteringly
as
many
times
as
was
necessary
before
the
evening
was
over
they
looked
tired
but
it
was
a
good
fatigue
and
when
they
finally
finished
and
turned
to
smile
at
each
other
and
fold
their
music
sheets
together
their
faces
wore
a
quiet
purified
serenity
which
marise
envied
them
this
was
music
not
one
of
them
was
thinking
of
himself
nor
how
the
music
had
made
him
appear
to
advantage
nor
how
he
could
use
music
as
a
tool
to
get
ahead
of
other
people
or
get
himself
talked
about
the
memory
of
donna
antonia
soirées
of
mme
de
la
cueva
good
advice
came
into
her
mind
people
called
that
sort
of
thing
did
they
it
was
the
cemetery
of
art
that
what
it
was
with
the
egotism
of
the
performer
dancing
on
the
grave
one
evening
here
such
an
evening
as
this
there
was
more
music
in
it
than
in
months
of
chatter
about
the
clothes
and
hair
and
morals
and
incomes
of
the
people
who
make
it
on
the
platform
at
the
piano
mlle
hasparren
and
father
armandariz
were
talking
together
of
the
next
evening
rehearsal
mlle
hasparren
occasionally
illustrating
with
one
hand
what
she
was
saying
how
deeply
human
was
the
look
of
intimate
confidence
they
bent
on
each
other
the
ugly
young
priest
and
the
ugly
old
they
might
well
be
thankful
that
they
had
found
each
other
in
the
world
mlle
hasparren
turned
around
now
and
asked
marise
if
she
would
not
play
for
them
i
would
be
so
proud
to
show
my
friends
what
an
old
pupil
of
mine
has
come
to
be
she
said
fondly
it
seemed
to
marise
that
she
had
never
in
her
life
felt
so
like
playing
what
should
it
be
she
swerved
on
her
way
to
the
piano
to
stoop
to
kiss
mlle
hasparren
swarthy
cheek
and
sitting
down
with
an
affectionate
smile
at
her
began
the
toccata
in
d
minor
just
as
mlle
hasparren
had
taught
it
to
her
with
all
she
had
learned
since
then
she
had
never
played
to
such
an
audience
when
she
turned
around
father
armandariz
was
looking
beatific
and
mlle
hasparren
exalted
with
pride
she
had
never
played
so
well
she
had
she
felt
just
begun
to
know
what
music
was
mlle
hasparren
had
set
up
for
her
a
folding
cot
in
her
own
room
since
there
was
no
other
bedroom
in
the
tiny
house
they
slept
side
by
side
near
enough
so
that
they
could
have
reached
out
and
clasped
each
hands
as
on
that
night
so
long
ago
when
mlle
hasparren
had
pulled
marise
out
of
the
black
pit
marise
could
not
go
to
sleep
long
after
mlle
hasparren
lay
breathing
deep
her
dark
face
relaxed
in
a
selfless
quiet
that
was
not
more
selfless
than
her
waking
look
marise
lay
looking
out
at
the
stars
and
the
mountains
thinking
trembling
sometimes
feeling
hot
bitter
tears
in
her
eyes
sometimes
feeling
her
heart
swell
high
with
strange
unearthly
aspiration
mlle
hasparren
was
right
she
had
always
been
right
to
keep
clear
of
all
troubling
maddening
personal
relations
that
were
sure
to
end
by
poisoning
you
not
to
want
anything
for
yourself
to
give
all
for
music
how
you
would
be
to
live
like
that
and
how
sweet
it
would
be
to
feel
safe
she
never
had
she
was
so
of
feeling
afraid
why
live
like
that
when
you
knew
it
was
the
only
safe
way
when
you
knew
that
if
you
did
not
you
would
fall
headlong
into
that
dreadful
mire
that
splashed
up
such
indelible
stains
upon
your
mind
at
even
the
few
chance
contacts
with
it
which
life
brought
to
a
girl
yes
that
was
the
only
safe
way
never
to
go
back
to
rome
at
all
somehow
to
devise
a
life
all
devotion
to
music
with
the
miserable
personal
affections
burned
up
in
that
greater
ardor
yes
that
marise
decided
that
was
the
only
tolerable
the
only
endurable
future
she
could
see
people
began
to
stand
up
to
put
on
their
wraps
and
collect
their
valises
the
train
was
passing
the
outskirts
of
rome
it
would
be
in
the
station
in
a
few
minutes
marise
tied
on
her
veil
over
a
piteous
white
face
she
had
said
she
would
not
go
back
to
rome
at
all
she
had
scarcely
been
ten
days
away
she
had
come
back
like
any
other
woman
she
had
come
back
to
the
trap
chapter
liii
she
had
not
seen
him
yet
she
had
had
her
breakfast
sent
to
her
room
when
she
heard
he
was
still
at
the
pension
she
had
thought
certainly
he
would
be
gone
away
by
this
time
she
knew
he
would
not
have
gone
away
she
stood
now
with
eugenia
at
the
entrance
to
the
pincian
up
on
the
hill
by
the
fountain
under
the
ilex
trees
looking
down
over
the
city
this
was
where
their
first
walk
together
had
ended
i
think
i
see
crittenden
just
come
up
the
trinità
steps
and
turning
this
way
remarked
eugenia
looking
in
that
direction
if
marise
could
have
stirred
she
would
have
run
away
she
turned
her
head
and
saw
him
coming
although
he
was
still
so
far
away
that
she
could
not
make
out
his
face
she
knew
by
the
sudden
tautness
of
his
figure
by
the
spring
forward
of
his
step
that
he
had
seen
her
there
he
came
striding
strongly
towards
her
as
he
had
come
to
seek
her
out
across
the
world
across
all
time
he
looked
infinitely
familiar
to
her
and
yet
infinitely
different
from
all
she
had
been
thinking
of
him
she
had
forgotten
what
had
she
been
imagining
him
when
he
drew
near
enough
to
be
sure
it
was
she
he
snatched
off
his
hat
and
swung
it
around
his
head
with
a
bright
boyish
gesture
of
joy
the
wind
ruffled
his
hair
the
sun
shone
full
on
his
bold
clear
face
on
his
deep
eyes
on
his
tender
mouth
he
was
smiling
at
her
all
his
heart
in
his
smile
he
was
welcoming
her
back
marise
felt
a
warm
gush
all
over
her
body
as
though
her
heart
had
suddenly
begun
to
beat
again
as
though
he
had
welcomed
her
back
into
life
why
this
was
neale
this
was
no
monster
to
dread
if
she
had
seen
him
only
seen
his
face
that
morning
only
had
one
look
from
his
eyes
that
both
smiled
and
were
steady
she
would
never
have
run
away
she
was
not
hurt
at
all
only
frightened
half
to
death
she
was
not
just
a
woman
in
love
ready
to
give
herself
up
to
a
man
she
was
marise
in
love
with
neale
he
had
come
up
to
them
now
his
breath
coming
fast
as
though
he
had
been
running
for
an
instant
he
did
not
speak
taking
her
hand
silently
in
his
all
that
life
had
made
of
him
looked
out
on
her
from
his
clear
eyes
with
a
beating
flutter
her
heart
sprang
up
from
its
numb
torpor
of
fright
and
spread
its
wings
well
we
certainly
have
missed
you
was
what
he
finally
said
i
very
glad
to
be
back
in
rome
she
answered
chapter
liv
i
he
had
stood
this
gregarious
flocking
around
just
all
he
was
going
to
neale
decided
that
morning
up
under
the
ilex
trees
exchanging
commonplaces
with
the
two
girls
unable
to
say
or
even
to
look
what
he
felt
because
eugenia
was
there
and
he
had
plenty
of
eugenia
during
the
last
ten
days
what
a
nightmare
those
ten
days
had
been
to
him
what
a
hideous
he
had
been
to
let
marise
slip
away
from
him
even
for
a
time
before
he
had
made
a
chance
to
see
her
to
see
her
in
a
quiet
place
where
they
could
hear
themselves
think
with
none
of
those
third
and
fourth
persons
hanging
around
what
had
he
been
thinking
of
drifting
along
like
a
man
in
a
dream
with
no
sense
of
time
but
that
absence
of
hers
had
waked
him
up
yes
it
had
waked
him
up
he
had
not
had
one
consecutive
night
sleep
since
she
had
been
gone
starting
up
continually
from
a
doze
with
his
arms
empty
when
he
had
dreamed
she
was
lying
in
them
how
had
he
ever
lived
through
that
suspense
and
uncertainty
without
losing
his
mind
he
was
very
grateful
to
eugenia
for
having
kept
him
from
making
an
awful
fool
of
himself
and
getting
into
a
blind
mess
of
confusion
she
had
kept
him
in
rome
by
telling
him
that
marise
would
be
back
any
day
if
it
had
been
for
that
where
would
have
been
looking
for
a
needle
in
a
haystack
all
over
southern
france
and
marise
back
in
rome
well
she
was
back
and
he
had
been
too
frightened
not
to
have
learned
a
little
sense
he
manage
a
walk
with
her
alone
just
the
two
of
them
before
the
day
was
out
or
how
could
he
how
did
you
do
anything
you
just
went
and
did
it
he
went
boldly
to
her
room
and
knocked
on
the
door
when
marise
came
to
open
it
he
said
to
celebrate
your
return
wo
you
let
me
show
you
a
specially
lovely
spot
on
the
campagna
i
found
i
been
taking
some
long
solitary
walks
while
you
were
away
he
added
firmly
no
not
miss
mills
and
livingstone
because
they
do
like
to
tramp
and
this
is
country
there
it
had
been
no
harder
than
that
why
in
the
name
of
heaven
he
thought
of
the
simple
obvious
way
to
get
the
thing
done
he
went
back
to
his
room
and
sat
down
staring
at
the
wall
to
wait
till
afternoon
came
and
to
try
to
plan
what
he
would
say
when
it
came
he
hoped
a
great
deal
that
she
had
read
browning
but
she
had
as
they
passed
through
the
city
walls
and
came
out
just
the
two
of
them
under
the
wide
sky
he
asked
her
about
it
timidly
for
he
was
horribly
frightened
and
moved
now
that
he
had
her
to
himself
and
she
said
that
she
was
sorry
she
was
very
ignorant
of
english
and
american
poetry
having
been
so
little
in
an
country
neale
sighed
no
luck
she
went
on
to
suggest
apologetically
that
she
ought
some
time
to
go
back
to
america
and
take
a
course
in
english
literature
or
at
least
gather
the
books
about
her
and
read
my
old
cousin
hetty
front
porch
would
be
a
bad
place
she
said
thoughtfully
i
going
to
see
that
front
porch
before
so
very
long
you
know
said
neale
springing
one
of
his
surprises
with
a
rapidly
beating
heart
and
an
impassive
face
she
darted
one
of
her
glances
at
him
yes
you
persuaded
me
i
persuaded
myself
i
not
going
to
sell
the
ashley
property
right
away
not
without
going
up
to
look
at
it
at
least
i
been
thinking
a
great
deal
about
what
you
said
that
first
day
i
been
thinking
a
great
deal
anyway
ca
ca
we
sit
down
somewhere
he
flung
away
any
pretense
of
having
a
special
place
to
show
her
she
too
had
apparently
forgotten
it
they
sat
down
on
the
short
grass
their
backs
against
a
low
heap
of
stones
part
of
the
ruins
of
a
very
ancient
aqueduct
far
in
the
distance
a
flock
of
sheep
roamed
with
a
solitary
shepherd
leaning
on
his
staff
you
know
you
know
what
we
been
talking
about
trying
to
find
way
know
what
you
were
meant
to
do
well
my
guess
about
myself
is
that
i
a
maker
by
birth
not
a
buyer
or
seller
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
better
it
looks
to
me
like
something
i
like
to
put
my
heart
into
doing
as
well
as
i
could
taking
raw
material
you
know
that
of
no
special
value
in
itself
and
helping
other
men
to
make
it
worth
more
by
adding
work
and
intelligence
to
it
you
know
what
somebody
said
about
the
ounce
of
iron
that
of
no
use
and
the
hundred
the
watchmaker
makes
out
of
it
i
do
see
why
i
did
think
of
it
at
once
when
i
knew
uncle
burton
had
left
me
the
mill
but
i
never
have
thought
of
it
if
you
had
helped
me
it
takes
me
so
to
get
around
to
anything
anyhow
and
you
are
so
quick
you
see
i
know
a
lot
about
the
and
quite
a
bit
about
saw
mills
and
i
can
get
on
fine
with
workmen
i
them
and
i
working
in
the
woods
and
and
he
brought
out
the
second
of
his
carefully
planned
points
it
would
be
a
home
too
you
said
it
was
a
home
everybody
wants
a
home
marise
he
sat
silent
listening
to
the
word
as
it
echoed
over
their
two
homeless
heads
and
then
he
took
his
courage
in
his
two
hands
and
turned
towards
marise
what
he
saw
in
her
face
so
shocked
and
startled
him
that
every
carefully
planned
word
dropped
from
his
mind
he
forgot
everything
except
that
the
dark
set
look
was
on
her
face
and
all
that
tragic
sadness
he
could
not
forget
marise
marise
what
is
it
he
cried
frightened
what
could
he
have
said
with
her
shoulders
and
eyebrows
she
made
an
ugly
dry
little
gesture
of
dismissing
the
subject
and
said
ironically
what
makes
you
so
sure
everybody
wants
a
home
he
stared
at
her
stupidly
not
able
to
think
of
anything
to
say
till
she
went
on
impatiently
irritably
it
just
sentimental
to
talk
like
that
i
never
heard
you
say
a
sentimental
word
before
you
know
what
homes
are
like
places
where
people
either
lie
to
each
other
or
quarrel
neale
was
startled
by
the
quivering
violence
of
her
accent
why
should
she
wince
and
shrink
back
as
if
he
had
struck
on
an
intolerably
sensitive
bruise
at
the
word
why
let
me
tell
you
about
my
home
he
said
eagerly
to
her
in
answer
to
the
tragic
challenge
he
felt
in
her
look
her
tone
i
do
believe
i
ever
told
you
about
what
my
home
was
like
just
the
usual
kind
of
course
what
any
child
has
i
suppose
but
let
me
you
about
it
he
began
anywhere
the
first
thing
that
came
into
his
mind
what
the
house
was
like
and
where
the
library
was
and
how
he
liked
his
own
room
and
the
security
of
it
his
free
play
with
little
boys
on
the
street
that
was
his
great
world
and
how
he
felt
back
of
him
as
a
sure
refuge
from
the
uncertainties
of
that
or
any
other
great
world
the
certainties
of
what
he
found
when
he
ran
up
the
steps
every
afternoon
opened
the
door
his
door
and
stepped
into
his
home
where
he
was
sure
of
being
loved
and
cared
for
and
yet
not
fettered
or
shut
in
father
and
mother
always
let
me
alone
let
me
grow
he
told
of
the
and
his
boy
raging
appetite
and
his
mother
delight
in
it
he
told
of
the
evenings
when
father
and
mother
sat
reading
together
of
the
tide
of
trust
and
affection
between
his
parents
changing
with
their
changes
never
the
same
never
different
trust
and
affection
of
which
he
had
never
been
really
conscious
but
which
had
always
been
the
background
of
his
life
he
remembered
even
to
his
father
tone
as
he
said
oh
mary
and
her
instant
yes
dear
what
is
it
he
had
not
thought
of
it
for
years
he
had
never
before
thought
consciously
of
it
had
always
taken
it
for
granted
as
he
took
daylight
or
his
own
good
health
but
there
in
that
foreign
land
it
all
stood
up
before
him
clear
in
its
own
quiet
colors
visible
to
him
for
the
first
time
against
the
other
worlds
he
had
been
seeing
and
divining
he
thought
of
foolish
little
gay
things
to
tell
her
he
could
not
have
guessed
why
they
came
into
his
mind
about
the
house
smelling
trunky
when
it
was
time
to
go
to
west
adams
and
mother
who
could
never
get
the
trunk
packed
and
father
joking
her
about
it
and
the
long
trip
over
to
the
city
father
always
waiting
to
let
him
see
how
the
was
tied
up
and
in
the
train
how
father
kissed
mother
and
then
neale
and
then
mother
again
and
put
his
cheek
for
an
instant
against
hers
this
time
neale
looked
back
through
the
years
straight
into
his
father
face
proudly
and
held
his
head
high
he
found
himself
telling
things
that
he
himself
had
never
thought
of
till
then
his
parents
tolerant
patience
with
his
boy
fits
and
starts
with
his
egotism
and
absurdities
with
his
periods
of
causeless
and
violent
energy
his
other
periods
of
causeless
violent
indolence
and
west
adams
he
had
always
till
this
moment
taken
for
granted
the
stability
of
that
second
home
of
his
that
had
been
his
father
before
him
like
a
rock
to
which
his
tossing
little
boat
was
moored
whenever
he
wished
grandfather
and
grandmother
plain
old
people
like
marise
old
cousin
hetty
perhaps
grown
as
much
alike
as
an
old
brother
and
sister
who
still
went
off
on
the
mountain
together
every
summer
and
then
when
he
had
needed
his
home
no
longer
the
of
his
father
and
mother
and
his
guessing
for
the
first
time
how
they
had
tamed
their
youth
to
be
parents
the
moment
when
he
and
father
stood
together
under
the
old
and
understood
each
other
so
deeply
with
no
words
all
the
years
of
affection
and
trust
rising
up
and
standing
there
with
them
and
how
father
and
mother
had
driven
away
as
if
for
an
indian
summer
honeymoon
mother
face
smiling
through
her
tears
he
told
yes
even
that
how
for
an
instant
he
had
felt
hurt
and
left
out
and
mother
had
known
it
and
come
running
back
to
say
a
last
loving
to
the
little
boy
he
had
been
marise
had
not
said
a
word
as
he
brought
this
all
up
for
her
to
see
nor
did
she
when
he
had
finished
and
was
silent
but
he
could
see
that
her
hands
folded
together
in
her
lap
were
shaking
he
waited
for
her
to
speak
he
knew
there
was
something
ominous
in
her
silence
like
gathering
thunder
his
heart
was
heavy
with
it
he
was
afraid
of
what
might
be
coming
but
he
longed
to
have
it
come
to
have
it
tear
down
the
barrier
between
them
so
that
what
you
have
known
what
every
child
has
you
suppose
she
said
passionately
her
voice
quivering
and
breaking
she
stopped
herself
abruptly
she
could
scarcely
breathe
her
agitation
was
so
great
she
knew
what
she
would
do
if
she
opened
her
lips
again
but
she
would
die
of
suffocation
if
she
did
not
speak
it
rose
within
her
like
a
devouring
flood
all
that
old
bitterness
and
beat
her
down
she
heard
herself
in
a
desperate
stammering
voice
telling
him
him
the
words
that
passed
her
lips
did
not
seem
words
but
bleeding
living
tortured
things
she
was
mortally
sick
and
faint
but
she
could
not
stop
once
as
in
a
flicker
of
lightning
she
knew
what
she
was
doing
and
tried
to
stop
but
she
had
torn
it
loose
from
those
fibers
that
had
grown
so
close
and
hard
around
it
she
had
wrenched
it
away
bloody
and
raw
it
was
too
late
to
stop
when
she
finished
she
leaned
her
face
on
her
hands
and
was
silent
feeling
as
though
she
had
died
when
she
finally
looked
up
at
him
she
saw
that
the
tears
stood
thick
in
his
eyes
she
had
never
dreamed
that
for
good
or
ill
one
human
being
could
feel
so
close
to
another
it
was
as
though
she
could
not
tell
whether
those
tears
were
his
or
had
come
healingly
into
her
own
dry
eyes
she
saw
the
anguish
of
his
yearning
sympathy
and
yet
what
was
it
he
said
something
she
had
not
dreamed
any
one
could
say
oh
the
poor
little
girl
you
were
was
there
to
help
you
to
get
it
straight
to
understand
it
understand
it
she
said
harshly
i
understood
it
only
too
well
he
looked
away
from
her
across
the
plain
and
kept
a
thoughtful
silence
then
he
said
i
do
believe
you
understood
it
in
the
least
is
it
likely
that
any
little
girl
could
understand
anything
like
that
anything
that
must
have
begun
had
its
real
causes
back
before
you
were
born
and
why
should
you
take
the
point
of
view
of
an
ignorant
old
woman
who
certainly
had
the
ignorant
old
appetite
for
scandal
you
probably
did
even
get
straight
what
really
happened
then
it
sounds
fearfully
mixed
up
you
know
as
though
there
must
be
more
than
that
to
it
let
alone
its
meaning
its
human
meaning
that
you
could
possibly
have
understood
at
fourteen
if
you
had
known
all
the
facts
and
there
certainly
were
lots
more
facts
than
what
you
saw
and
what
that
old
woman
put
into
your
head
and
anyhow
oh
marise
no
matter
it
was
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
life
why
do
you
let
it
mean
so
much
to
you
just
think
how
long
ago
it
happened
it
has
a
thing
to
do
with
how
can
it
she
flushed
a
deep
shamed
red
and
asked
in
a
whisper
you
do
think
that
i
that
i
would
be
like
that
he
cried
out
furiously
no
no
what
an
idea
it
nothing
to
you
nothing
i
tell
you
it
been
nothing
to
you
for
years
you
ought
to
have
stopped
thinking
of
it
ever
so
long
ago
everybody
starts
all
over
again
you
yourself
you
do
have
to
keep
carrying
that
around
with
you
it
does
belong
to
you
let
it
fall
leave
it
here
he
commanded
abruptly
springing
to
his
feet
and
holding
out
his
hand
to
help
her
rise
leave
it
here
and
walk
off
into
your
own
life
she
stood
up
beside
him
now
so
giddy
with
a
strange
new
lightness
that
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
to
steady
herself
at
her
touch
he
flushed
hot
with
the
desire
to
put
his
arms
about
her
and
hold
her
passionately
close
the
desire
was
so
intense
that
he
had
for
an
instant
the
hallucination
that
he
had
done
it
that
she
leaned
her
head
against
his
breast
but
he
had
been
so
harrowed
by
sympathy
for
her
poor
bruised
heart
had
been
so
touched
by
the
revelation
of
the
delicacy
and
fineness
of
fiber
which
had
but
served
to
deepen
the
dreadful
unhealed
hurt
with
which
she
had
lived
helplessly
he
was
so
moved
by
her
white
drawn
face
lifted
to
his
own
with
a
childlike
faith
in
what
he
said
he
was
so
wrung
with
his
thankfulness
to
see
on
that
pale
face
a
sensitive
reflection
of
his
own
certainty
oh
now
was
no
time
to
burst
out
on
her
with
the
flame
of
his
passion
now
when
she
was
so
weak
so
defenseless
he
put
aside
his
passion
with
a
strong
hand
resolutely
looking
at
him
she
saw
his
face
flush
darkly
with
his
desire
and
felt
herself
as
safe
from
a
touch
as
though
she
looked
down
on
him
from
a
high
tower
had
she
ever
felt
safe
before
she
leaned
on
his
arm
like
a
convalescent
she
walked
off
beside
him
quietly
into
her
own
life
the
walk
back
to
the
city
walls
was
as
full
of
a
comforting
silent
sense
of
each
other
presence
as
though
they
had
lived
their
lives
together
once
in
a
while
they
spoke
together
as
simply
and
naturally
as
children
of
small
everyday
things
of
little
changes
he
would
need
to
make
in
his
house
an
old
cistern
to
be
drained
and
filled
in
the
maple
which
darkened
the
cut
down
to
let
the
sunlight
in
in
one
of
the
quiet
silences
full
to
the
brim
with
their
nearness
to
each
other
neale
remembered
what
he
had
meant
to
do
with
this
afternoon
what
he
had
so
planned
to
say
the
thought
made
him
abashed
and
humble
how
infinitely
deeper
life
was
than
you
could
ever
know
till
you
began
to
live
he
had
thought
he
loved
marise
as
much
as
a
man
could
love
a
woman
he
saw
that
he
had
only
begun
to
guess
what
love
could
be
that
it
is
a
tie
between
two
struggling
human
beings
as
well
as
between
a
man
and
a
woman
and
that
it
is
not
to
be
had
without
effort
and
growth
it
was
something
that
would
take
all
there
was
in
him
to
live
up
to
as
he
walked
beside
her
he
was
dedicating
all
there
was
in
him
to
loving
her
ii
she
was
tired
heavenly
tired
when
she
reached
her
room
that
late
afternoon
she
had
not
been
tired
like
that
since
she
was
a
little
girl
relaxed
abandoned
before
the
advance
of
sleep
she
could
scarcely
think
coherently
enough
to
remember
to
send
word
that
she
would
not
appear
at
dinner
before
she
was
undressed
and
in
her
bed
there
was
nothing
in
her
mind
but
this
exquisite
fatigue
from
which
presently
even
now
as
she
thought
of
it
sleep
would
drift
her
away
she
laid
her
tired
head
on
the
pillow
with
a
long
breath
some
weak
tears
gathered
in
her
eyes
and
ran
slowly
down
but
they
were
sweet
tears
not
bitter
and
so
she
fell
asleep
it
was
late
when
she
woke
well
on
into
the
next
day
and
the
room
was
filled
with
the
crystal
clarity
of
daylight
as
she
opened
her
eyes
she
was
thinking
as
though
it
were
the
continuation
of
a
dream
that
if
she
ever
had
children
she
would
she
would
take
of
them
she
would
learn
how
always
to
be
close
to
them
so
that
she
would
be
there
ready
to
help
them
when
she
would
leave
them
helplessly
to
think
that
the
evil
was
in
life
itself
and
not
in
coarse
and
evil
minds
she
would
leave
them
for
years
to
think
that
the
poor
mean
joking
of
sniggering
servants
is
all
there
is
to
life
and
love
she
would
stand
up
for
them
look
out
for
them
marise
stood
fiercely
on
her
guard
for
them
now
up
in
arms
against
what
threatened
them
it
had
never
before
in
her
life
not
even
fleetingly
not
once
occurred
to
her
that
she
might
ever
have
children
she
knew
now
that
she
wanted
them
that
was
the
second
step
into
her
own
life
chapter
lv
neale
could
not
sleep
of
course
he
could
not
sleep
sleep
was
for
fools
with
nothing
to
think
about
but
neale
had
such
things
to
think
about
she
had
let
him
in
she
had
let
him
in
he
stood
in
the
holy
of
holies
and
knew
that
he
was
welcome
now
he
knew
the
meaning
of
her
look
that
first
evening
on
the
roof
now
he
knew
why
up
there
under
the
ilex
trees
that
morning
her
dear
eyes
had
been
for
an
instant
wild
as
if
with
fright
when
he
drew
near
and
yet
even
before
she
had
let
him
in
her
eyes
had
softened
from
fright
to
quiet
trust
as
he
looked
down
at
her
had
softened
to
that
look
look
which
thrust
him
through
and
through
with
love
for
her
he
turned
impatiently
back
and
forth
on
his
bed
seeing
everywhere
he
looked
those
liquid
dark
eyes
that
sweet
sweet
mouth
till
he
held
his
empty
arms
out
longingly
in
the
dark
his
desire
was
like
a
fire
he
knew
such
pain
as
he
had
not
dreamed
of
and
he
would
not
for
any
price
have
lost
an
instant
of
that
pain
had
he
ever
said
he
was
an
unlighted
torch
he
was
flaming
now
to
his
last
fiber
presently
he
got
up
lighted
his
candle
and
dressed
it
was
impossible
to
lie
still
with
this
fire
of
life
blazing
in
him
he
would
be
beside
himself
by
dawn
if
he
had
not
worked
some
of
it
off
he
let
himself
out
carefully
into
the
corridor
and
walked
down
to
her
door
there
before
it
were
her
shoes
her
little
dusty
shoes
which
had
brought
her
back
to
him
he
picked
one
up
and
held
it
in
his
hand
he
stroked
it
like
something
alive
the
dust
on
it
was
dear
to
him
when
he
stepped
out
into
the
silent
deserted
piazza
a
church
clock
struck
two
boomingly
the
night
air
was
cool
on
his
cheek
the
great
starlit
dusky
sky
spacious
over
his
head
was
none
too
large
to
hold
the
greatness
in
his
heart
that
night
it
filled
all
space
to
the
last
dim
shining
star
he
set
off
at
random
anywhere
not
noticing
where
his
feet
took
him
up
one
street
and
down
another
blindly
as
he
had
lived
and
yet
somehow
he
had
found
his
goal
the
splash
of
water
struck
on
his
ear
he
saw
in
the
starlight
the
dim
sheen
and
sparkle
of
a
fountain
trevi
he
stood
still
to
think
of
what
it
reminded
him
madison
square
and
martha
his
heart
went
out
to
martha
as
he
stood
there
he
thought
of
her
not
with
embarrassment
as
the
woman
he
had
loved
before
he
met
marise
he
had
not
loved
her
he
thought
of
martha
tenderly
calmly
with
deep
gratitude
he
owed
all
this
to
her
she
had
saved
him
from
the
dingy
life
he
had
been
so
dingily
ready
to
accept
she
had
somehow
divined
that
there
must
be
something
else
something
else
neale
was
shaken
at
the
thought
why
now
this
instant
if
some
one
struck
him
down
dead
as
he
stood
there
he
would
have
lived
more
known
more
of
the
joy
and
sacredness
of
love
than
after
forty
years
with
martha
he
wished
he
knew
how
to
pray
so
that
he
could
pray
that
martha
too
might
know
it
and
then
with
a
rush
martha
was
gone
from
his
mind
and
marise
stood
there
marise
looking
up
at
him
with
piteous
frightened
eyes
that
softened
to
trust
to
quiet
trust
he
set
off
swiftly
swinging
his
arms
and
talking
to
himself
how
could
he
be
worthy
of
such
a
trust
he
be
worthy
of
it
by
god
he
would
give
her
a
square
deal
a
square
deal
such
as
no
other
woman
ever
had
the
whole
of
his
heart
his
respect
his
honor
he
would
share
his
life
with
her
loyally
as
with
an
equal
no
hidden
thoughts
no
openness
no
dark
corners
of
compromise
no
secret
chambers
kept
for
himself
all
the
great
gates
flung
open
to
welcome
her
into
her
own
home
he
flung
his
arms
wide
and
looked
up
at
the
stars
which
were
beginning
faintly
to
grow
dim
against
the
whitening
sky
his
passion
seized
on
him
now
and
shook
him
till
he
was
faint
with
it
when
it
passed
for
a
little
he
turned
back
towards
the
east
towards
the
pincian
hill
where
he
had
so
often
walked
with
her
where
he
had
seen
her
that
morning
the
shade
of
the
ilex
trees
was
full
of
her
presence
to
him
he
was
far
from
there
half
across
the
city
as
if
it
were
a
goal
he
had
set
himself
he
began
to
hasten
to
lengthen
his
stride
to
let
out
some
of
the
strength
that
boiled
up
in
him
like
a
geyser
it
did
him
good
to
walk
furiously
fast
to
tire
himself
a
little
his
thoughts
grew
less
wild
his
heart
stopped
leaping
and
pounding
she
had
looked
frightened
because
she
was
afraid
of
love
poor
darling
as
she
was
of
life
he
would
show
her
what
love
could
be
he
would
wash
all
that
old
poison
of
doubt
and
distrust
and
fear
out
of
her
life
with
the
ocean
of
his
love
they
would
live
together
so
openly
so
honestly
so
naturally
that
she
could
forget
wholly
all
the
sick
morbid
impressions
that
her
life
had
left
on
her
that
she
would
come
to
trust
and
love
life
and
love
and
nature
with
its
serene
progression
of
birth
growth
death
even
the
decay
which
is
only
preparation
for
another
birth
why
that
was
something
he
could
for
her
he
had
something
to
give
her
something
she
needed
something
to
match
a
little
the
golden
treasure
she
poured
out
on
him
with
her
every
glance
it
was
incredible
good
fortune
how
under
the
sun
could
a
man
a
poor
plain
ordinary
human
being
live
so
that
he
might
be
worthy
of
such
transcendent
good
fortune
he
was
swinging
up
the
long
steps
now
the
dawn
white
and
clear
about
him
here
was
where
he
had
turned
that
morning
and
saw
her
standing
afar
off
bright
under
the
black
shade
come
back
to
him
here
was
where
he
had
been
near
enough
to
see
her
face
her
brows
drawn
together
the
seeking
look
in
her
eyes
he
had
always
thought
marise
eyes
seemed
to
be
looking
for
something
here
was
where
he
had
seen
that
they
looked
frightened
and
now
he
stood
on
the
very
spot
where
she
had
stood
and
he
saw
again
her
eyes
soften
into
quiet
trust
if
somehow
she
might
find
in
him
what
she
was
looking
for
his
heart
stood
still
in
awe
he
looked
out
over
the
sleeping
city
its
roofs
and
domes
and
towers
coming
palely
into
the
new
day
and
he
saw
her
dark
eyes
soften
from
fright
to
quiet
trust
god
suppose
he
had
never
lived
never
known
marise
the
sweat
stood
out
on
him
at
the
thought
if
she
could
if
she
could
look
into
his
face
and
find
that
life
had
put
there
what
she
sought
the
sun
rose
magnificently
and
cast
over
all
the
world
a
flood
of
golden
light
neale
stood
in
it
praising
and
magnifying
god
who
had
sent
him
into
life
chapter
lvi
they
were
on
their
way
to
hear
a
palestrina
mass
in
a
chapel
at
peter
and
stopped
beside
one
of
the
great
fountains
rushing
with
a
leap
into
the
brilliant
air
and
falling
in
white
clouds
of
spray
i
heard
said
livingstone
that
if
you
get
at
the
right
angle
to
the
sun
you
can
see
a
million
little
rainbows
they
began
to
walk
here
and
there
over
the
wet
around
the
base
of
the
fountain
looking
up
at
the
glittering
splendor
of
the
upward
plunging
water
their
ears
filled
with
the
liquid
silver
plashing
and
dripping
of
its
fall
perhaps
this
is
the
right
fountain
with
the
sun
where
it
is
suggested
livingstone
he
and
eugenia
walked
off
across
the
wide
piazza
towards
the
other
fountain
neale
turned
towards
marise
she
was
standing
on
the
other
side
of
the
basin
and
as
he
looked
at
her
the
wind
flung
the
huge
white
veil
of
spray
over
her
she
stood
in
its
midst
like
a
novice
in
her
white
robes
or
like
a
bride
her
eyes
were
lifted
to
the
great
plume
of
the
leaping
water
he
sprang
toward
her
crying
jealously
what
do
you
think
of
when
you
look
like
that
he
raised
his
voice
to
drown
out
the
shouting
uproar
of
the
water
the
wind
caught
the
spray
and
cast
it
away
to
the
other
side
she
answered
him
dreamily
i
was
wondering
how
we
could
ever
know
what
we
are
made
for
the
wind
shifted
and
for
an
instant
cast
the
white
veil
over
them
both
through
it
he
called
to
her
know
i
know
what
i
was
made
for
to
love
you
all
the
days
of
my
life
the
wind
whirled
away
the
sparkling
curtain
of
water
they
stood
in
the
quiet
golden
sunshine
his
ears
rang
in
the
silence
had
he
really
at
last
cried
it
out
to
her
or
was
it
only
one
more
of
the
thousand
times
when
he
had
cried
it
soundlessly
to
his
own
heart
eugenia
and
livingstone
had
come
back
were
beside
them
now
between
them
carrying
them
along
up
the
endless
steps
to
the
church
door
it
was
like
walking
in
a
dream
neale
tried
to
see
marise
face
but
it
was
hidden
by
the
droop
of
her
hat
only
the
sweet
sweet
lines
of
her
lips
no
it
could
not
be
that
he
had
spoken
it
had
been
only
another
of
those
blinding
moments
when
his
heart
flung
itself
up
shouting
into
the
sunshine
of
her
look
they
stepped
silently
into
the
dusky
chapel
mass
had
begun
eugenia
and
marise
sank
to
their
knees
livingstone
standing
on
one
side
neale
on
the
other
the
crowd
pressing
thick
and
close
about
them
from
the
choir
came
a
long
sonorous
chant
and
then
a
silence
in
which
neale
thoughts
pounding
and
hammering
in
his
head
were
stilled
to
one
great
solemn
petition
the
priest
turned
and
passed
from
one
side
of
the
altar
to
the
other
he
raised
his
hands
over
the
heads
of
the
kneeling
people
and
chanted
the
pax
vobiscum
et
cum
spiritu
tuo
responded
the
choir
on
three
long
sighing
notes
that
brought
peace
with
them
standing
there
upright
looking
over
the
heads
of
the
densely
packed
crowd
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
steady
yellow
flame
of
the
neale
felt
a
touch
on
his
hand
his
heart
stopped
beating
he
knew
the
lightest
touch
of
that
hand
as
he
knew
the
lightest
sound
of
that
voice
he
stood
motionless
not
breathing
waiting
he
felt
marise
slip
her
hand
into
his
and
hold
it
fast
in
a
close
close
clasp
but
not
so
firm
as
his
own
on
hers
through
the
dear
flesh
of
that
dear
hand
he
felt
her
pulse
beating
against
his
own
as
if
he
held
her
in
his
arms
the
yellow
flames
of
the
flickered
and
blurred
before
his
eyes
a
great
hosanna
burst
from
the
choir
or
was
it
in
his
heart
chapter
lvii
how
suddenly
it
had
all
broken
up
livingstone
thought
forlornly
their
pleasant
little
quartet
of
walks
and
talks
he
had
the
sensation
of
being
left
stranded
by
the
ebbing
of
a
tide
which
had
seemed
to
buoy
him
up
on
great
depths
with
the
disappearance
of
miss
mills
back
to
her
paris
apartment
the
very
light
had
gone
out
of
everything
miss
allen
never
had
had
the
social
grace
and
ease
of
miss
mills
and
now
she
ate
her
meals
silently
and
vanished
immediately
and
crittenden
not
being
a
social
light
on
any
occasion
was
of
less
than
no
use
in
saving
the
situation
livingstone
was
reduced
to
solitary
mornings
spent
in
museums
with
a
book
of
art
criticism
in
his
hand
or
on
sunday
mornings
when
admission
was
free
on
a
bench
in
the
park
on
the
palatine
the
benches
were
very
comfortable
there
not
mere
backless
slabs
of
stone
and
when
you
felt
like
you
could
get
up
and
lean
over
the
wall
and
look
down
into
the
forum
and
pick
out
where
the
different
buildings
had
stood
he
stood
thus
his
back
to
the
long
path
trying
to
be
archeological
his
open
on
the
wall
which
of
the
battered
rows
of
stumps
of
pillars
had
been
the
temple
of
vesta
and
which
the
fornix
fabianus
he
heard
voices
back
of
him
to
be
exact
he
heard
miss
allen
voice
back
of
him
livingstone
was
so
paralyzed
by
the
quality
of
it
that
gentleman
though
he
tried
to
be
to
the
marrow
of
his
bones
he
was
for
an
instant
incapable
of
stirring
and
announcing
his
presence
miss
allen
voice
she
sounded
as
though
she
had
come
into
a
fortune
but
what
under
the
sun
was
she
saying
here
exactly
here
is
where
we
stood
when
you
said
you
were
like
the
puppy
and
when
you
rolled
the
dusty
weight
of
all
those
centuries
off
my
shoulders
and
now
come
along
the
next
place
in
the
pilgrimage
is
john
lateran
where
you
said
you
brutal
prussian
that
nothing
would
induce
you
to
protect
a
woman
come
come
this
is
eavesdropping
something
must
be
done
said
livingstone
to
himself
he
shut
his
with
a
slam
to
give
them
warning
and
faced
about
resolutely
but
they
had
paid
no
attention
to
his
warning
they
stood
with
their
backs
to
him
and
oh
hand
in
hand
like
rustics
at
a
country
fair
but
she
had
called
him
a
brutal
prussian
and
a
puppy
ahem
said
livingstone
loudly
not
knowing
what
else
to
say
they
turned
about
and
saw
him
and
seemed
neither
surprised
nor
ashamed
miss
allen
stepped
quickly
towards
him
smiling
and
saying
oh
livingstone
we
were
meaning
to
tell
you
anyhow
crittenden
and
i
are
going
to
be
married
she
smiled
at
him
dazzlingly
as
she
spoke
but
livingstone
was
not
at
all
sure
from
the
expression
of
her
eyes
that
she
saw
him
it
crossed
his
mind
that
she
would
have
smiled
as
dazzlingly
as
that
if
a
had
stood
in
his
place
married
he
cried
really
aghast
for
both
of
them
that
sensitive
imaginative
girl
tied
for
life
to
that
unfeeling
rough
hard
fellow
what
on
earth
did
she
even
for
a
moment
see
in
him
and
as
for
crittenden
any
man
with
a
little
money
of
his
own
personable
enough
to
marry
advantageously
throwing
himself
away
on
a
girl
without
a
penny
either
now
or
in
prospect
to
what
a
wretched
cramped
life
he
was
dooming
himself
and
her
back
rooms
in
greasy
pensions
never
any
margin
for
decent
clothes
yes
and
we
going
to
live
in
ashley
vermont
livingstone
sank
down
on
his
bench
appalled
worse
than
pensions
worse
than
the
human
mind
could
conceive
oh
no
no
no
he
cried
to
her
as
though
he
were
clutching
at
her
as
she
sank
to
ruin
no
do
say
that
you
no
idea
my
dear
young
lady
you
have
the
faintest
idea
what
an
impossible
life
that
would
be
you
must
consider
it
for
a
moment
crittenden
you
must
let
her
consider
it
an
american
country
village
good
god
you
do
know
what
it
is
what
the
people
are
yes
i
do
too
she
told
him
gaily
giving
the
effect
though
she
stood
quite
still
of
executing
a
twirling
pirouette
of
high
spirits
i
lived
there
it
really
going
back
home
for
both
of
us
home
why
crittenden
certainly
told
me
he
never
been
there
in
his
life
oh
pshaw
livingstone
do
be
so
and
literal
why
imaginative
fancy
said
crittenden
laughing
loudly
as
though
some
one
had
made
a
joke
he
might
for
the
impression
he
made
on
livingstone
have
joined
hands
with
the
girl
to
dance
madly
around
him
in
a
circle
but
this
was
no
laughing
matter
this
was
terrible
tragic
they
had
simply
lost
their
heads
both
of
them
lost
their
heads
and
had
no
idea
what
they
were
doing
you
could
tell
that
by
the
wild
glitter
in
their
eyes
they
were
infatuated
that
was
it
infatuated
he
must
try
to
recall
them
to
their
senses
he
turned
imploringly
to
the
girl
but
but
but
he
was
so
agitated
that
he
could
not
bring
out
his
words
he
stopped
drew
a
long
breath
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
then
very
solemnly
do
you
know
he
said
to
her
warningly
do
you
know
that
you
will
probably
have
to
your
own
at
this
she
burst
into
an
inexplicable
foolish
shout
of
laughter
opening
her
eyes
very
wide
at
him
and
saying
appalling
she
looked
up
at
crittenden
who
for
his
part
never
took
his
eyes
an
instant
from
her
how
foolishly
she
talked
how
foolishly
she
laughed
why
they
were
acting
as
sentimentally
as
livingstone
could
not
think
of
any
comparison
adequate
to
their
foolishness
they
were
moving
away
now
nodding
to
him
and
smiling
at
each
other
at
the
top
of
the
dark
steps
leading
down
through
the
palace
of
the
cæsars
to
the
forum
they
turned
and
cast
a
backward
glance
at
him
who
stood
where
they
had
left
him
staring
after
them
dumfounded
miss
allen
looked
at
him
and
then
came
flying
back
running
her
light
dress
fluttering
what
did
she
want
what
was
she
going
to
do
with
that
shining
tremulous
mirthful
face
livingstone
felt
afraid
of
her
as
if
like
a
swift
bolt
of
summer
lightning
she
might
strike
him
through
and
through
what
she
did
was
to
take
his
face
in
her
two
hands
and
give
him
a
hearty
kiss
on
each
cheek
mr
livingstone
she
said
or
was
it
livingstone
had
the
impression
from
the
expression
of
her
face
that
she
would
have
kissed
a
cabman
with
equal
fervor
and
that
crittenden
would
have
watched
her
do
it
with
the
same
fatuous
look
he
had
now
they
went
down
together
into
the
vaulted
darkness
and
desolation
of
the
ruined
palace
livingstone
leaning
on
the
wall
high
above
saw
them
emerge
together
into
the
forum
and
step
off
over
the
ancient
flagged
paving
and
still
hand
in
hand
livingstone
had
by
this
time
thought
of
an
adequate
comparison
they
were
as
sentimental
as
a
couple
of
rogers
statuettes
looking
up
they
saw
him
leaning
there
they
waved
their
hands
and
called
up
some
laughing
greeting
to
him
but
he
could
not
understand
what
they
said
because
they
were
too
far
away
from
him

in
