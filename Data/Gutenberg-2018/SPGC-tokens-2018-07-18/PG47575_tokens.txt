preface
should
the
story
of
a
country
town
find
readers
it
may
be
interesting
to
them
to
know
that
it
was
written
entirely
at
night
after
the
writer
had
finished
a
hard
day
s
work
as
editor
and
publisher
of
a
small
evening
newspaper
i
do
not
think
a
line
of
it
was
written
while
the
sun
was
shining
but
in
almost
every
chapter
there
are
recollections
of
the
midnight
bell
no
one
can
possibly
find
more
fault
with
it
than
i
have
found
myself
a
hundred
times
i
have
been
on
the
point
of
burning
the
manuscript
and
never
attempting
it
again
for
i
was
always
tired
while
working
at
it
and
always
dissatisfied
after
concluding
an
evening
s
work
i
offer
this
as
a
general
apology
for
its
many
defects
and
can
only
hope
it
will
meet
with
the
charity
it
deserves
i
believe
that
when
i
began
the
story
i
had
some
sort
of
an
idea
that
i
might
be
able
to
write
an
acceptable
work
of
fiction
but
i
have
changed
it
so
often
and
worried
about
it
so
much
that
at
its
conclusion
i
have
no
idea
whether
it
is
very
bad
or
only
indifferent
i
think
that
originally
i
had
some
hope
that
it
might
enable
me
to
get
rid
of
my
weary
newspaper
work
and
help
me
to
more
ease
than
i
have
ever
known
but
i
am
so
tired
now
that
i
am
incapable
of
exercising
my
judgment
with
reference
to
it
if
it
prove
a
success
or
a
failure
i
shall
not
be
surprised
for
i
have
no
opinion
of
my
own
on
the
subject
for
several
years
i
have
felt
that
i
would
like
an
opportunity
to
address
a
larger
audience
than
my
newspaper
s
circulation
affords
but
i
find
now
that
i
am
very
timid
about
it
and
worry
a
great
deal
for
fear
the
verdict
will
not
be
favorable
a
gentleman
who
once
looked
over
a
portion
of
the
manuscript
said
his
first
impression
was
that
it
was
the
work
of
a
tired
man
and
that
the
pen
seemed
to
drag
heavily
in
making
the
words
i
fear
this
will
be
the
verdict
of
the
people
and
that
they
will
say
i
should
have
given
up
my
newspaper
writing
before
attempting
it
the
reason
i
did
not
do
this
was
that
i
had
no
confidence
in
my
ability
to
become
an
acceptable
historian
of
a
country
town
therefore
i
worked
harder
than
i
should
during
the
day
and
went
wearily
at
the
story
at
night
should
inquiry
be
made
as
to
whether
any
part
of
the
story
be
true
i
could
only
reply
that
i
have
never
known
anyone
who
did
not
furnish
some
suggestion
or
idea
in
the
construction
of
the
book
as
i
have
never
lived
in
a
town
that
did
not
afford
some
material
for
the
description
of
twin
mounds
i
meet
jo
errings
every
day
and
frequently
lead
them
up
to
denounce
their
particular
clinton
bragg
i
have
known
several
john
westlocks
and
i
am
afraid
that
mateel
shepherds
are
more
numerous
than
is
desirable
i
have
known
troops
of
john
westlocks
for
in
the
country
where
i
was
brought
up
all
the
women
were
pale
timid
and
overworked
i
hope
that
agnes
deming
can
be
duplicated
in
every
community
and
i
believe
that
big
adams
are
numerous
everywhere
but
i
must
confess
that
i
never
knew
but
one
little
biggs
though
his
wife
may
be
seen
hurrying
out
of
the
way
should
you
decide
to
look
for
her
in
every
third
or
fourth
house
i
hope
there
will
be
general
sympathy
for
jo
erring
in
writing
the
history
of
this
creature
of
my
fancy
i
have
almost
come
to
believe
that
i
have
an
uncle
of
that
name
and
that
he
lived
and
died
as
i
have
narrated
sometimes
i
think
of
him
wandering
in
the
cave
crying
help
help
i
am
lost
and
his
voice
is
very
pitiful
and
distressed
at
other
times
he
has
come
into
my
room
and
sat
beside
me
as
i
wrote
i
have
been
with
him
to
the
cave
on
a
stormy
night
and
heard
the
beginning
of
the
few
sweet
chords
of
music
he
describes
but
which
were
immediately
broken
into
by
the
furious
uproar
of
devils
sometimes
i
think
i
have
found
him
in
life
and
that
he
is
still
listening
at
night
to
the
horrible
noise
of
his
skeleton
if
some
one
should
confess
to
me
that
he
is
jo
erring
in
every
particular
except
that
when
the
keeper
of
the
twin
mounds
jail
gave
him
opportunity
he
ran
away
i
believe
i
should
be
his
friend
in
our
part
of
the
country
there
was
a
strange
man
answering
to
the
description
of
damon
barker
and
i
often
visited
him
when
a
boy
but
he
lived
in
a
hovel
on
the
prairie
which
was
dirty
beyond
description
he
had
boxes
filled
with
strange
and
brass
pistols
without
number
and
he
told
me
stories
but
he
ran
a
nursery
instead
of
a
mill
though
i
have
heard
that
he
had
a
sister
i
originally
intended
to
make
these
two
central
figures
in
the
story
but
jo
erring
wandered
into
my
mind
and
i
am
afraid
i
have

conclusion
the
story
of
a
country
town
chapter
fairview
ours
was
the
prairie
district
out
west
where
we
had
gone
to
grow
up
with
the
country
i
believe
that
nearly
every
farmer
for
miles
around
moved
to
the
neighborhood
at
the
same
time
and
that
my
father
s
wagons
headed
the
procession
i
have
heard
that
most
of
them
gathered
about
him
on
the
way
and
as
he
preached
from
his
wagon
wherever
night
overtook
him
and
held
on
sundays
he
attracted
a
following
of
men
travelling
the
same
road
who
did
not
know
themselves
where
they
were
going
although
a
few
of
the
number
started
with
him
among
them
my
mother
s
father
and
his
family
when
he
came
to
a
place
that
suited
him
he
picked
out
the
land
he
wanted
which
any
man
was
free
to
do
at
that
time
and
the
others
settled
about
him
in
the
dusty
tramp
of
civilization
westward
which
seems
to
have
always
been
justified
by
a
tradition
that
men
grow
up
by
reason
of
it
our
section
was
not
a
favorite
and
remained
new
and
unsettled
after
counties
and
states
farther
west
had
grown
old
every
one
who
came
there
seemed
favorably
impressed
with
the
steady
fertility
of
the
soil
and
expressed
surprise
that
the
lands
were
not
all
occupied
but
no
one
in
the
great
outside
world
talked
about
it
and
no
one
wrote
about
it
so
that
those
who
were
looking
for
homes
went
to
the
west
or
the
north
where
others
were
going
there
were
cheap
lands
farther
on
where
the
people
raised
a
crop
one
year
and
were
supported
by
charity
the
next
where
towns
sprang
up
on
credit
and
farms
were
opened
with
borrowed
money
where
the
people
were
apparently
content
for
our
locality
did
not
seem
to
be
far
enough
west
nor
far
enough
north
to
suit
them
where
no
sooner
was
one
stranger
s
money
exhausted
than
another
arrived
to
take
his
place
where
men
mortgaged
their
possessions
at
full
value
and
thought
themselves
rich
notwithstanding
so
great
was
their
faith
in
the
country
where
he
who
was
deepest
in
debt
was
the
leading
citizen
and
where
bankruptcy
caught
them
all
at
last
on
these
lands
the
dusty
travellers
settled
where
there
were
churches
and
bridges
but
little
rain
and
railroads
to
carry
out
the
crops
should
any
be
raised
and
when
any
one
stopped
in
our
neighborhood
he
was
too
poor
and
tired
to
follow
the
others
i
became
early
impressed
with
the
fact
that
our
people
seemed
to
be
miserable
and
discontented
and
frequently
wondered
that
they
did
not
load
their
effects
on
wagons
again
and
move
away
from
a
place
which
made
all
the
men
surly
and
rough
and
the
women
pale
and
fretful
although
i
had
never
been
to
the
country
they
had
left
except
as
a
baby
in
arms
i
was
unfavorably
impressed
with
it
thinking
it
must
have
been
a
very
poor
one
that
such
a
lot
of
people
left
it
and
considered
their
condition
bettered
by
the
change
for
they
never
talked
of
going
back
and
were
therefore
probably
better
satisfied
than
they
had
ever
been
before
a
road
ran
by
our
house
and
when
i
first
began
to
think
about
it
at
all
i
thought
that
the
covered
wagons
travelling
it
carried
people
moving
from
the
country
from
which
those
in
our
neighborhood
came
and
the
wagons
were
so
numerous
that
i
was
led
to
believe
that
at
least
half
the
people
of
the
world
had
tried
to
live
there
and
moved
away
after
an
unfortunate
experience
on
the
highest
and
bleakest
point
in
the
county
where
the
winds
were
plenty
in
winter
because
they
were
not
needed
and
scarce
in
summer
for
an
opposite
reason
the
was
built
in
a
corner
of
my
father
s
field
this
was
called
fairview
and
so
the
neighborhood
was
known
there
was
a
graveyard
around
it
and
cornfields
next
to
that
but
not
a
tree
or
shrub
attempted
its
ornament
and
as
the
building
stood
on
the
main
road
where
the
movers
wagons
passed
i
thought
that
next
to
their
ambition
to
get
away
from
the
country
which
had
been
left
by
those
in
fairview
the
movers
were
anxious
to
get
away
from
fairview
church
and
avoid
the
possibility
of
being
buried
in
its
ugly
shadow
for
they
always
seemed
to
drive
faster
after
passing
it
high
up
in
a
steeple
which
rocked
with
every
wind
was
a
great
bell
the
gift
of
a
missionary
society
and
when
there
was
a
storm
this
tolled
with
fitful
and
uncertain
strokes
as
if
the
ghosts
from
the
grave
lot
had
crawled
up
there
and
were
counting
the
number
to
be
buried
the
coming
year
keeping
the
people
awake
for
miles
around
sometimes
when
the
wind
was
particularly
high
there
were
a
great
number
of
strokes
on
the
bell
in
quick
succession
which
the
pious
said
was
an
alarm
to
the
wicked
sounded
by
the
devil
a
warning
relating
to
the
conflagration
which
could
never
be
put
out
else
fairview
would
never
have
been
built
when
any
one
died
it
was
the
custom
to
toll
the
bell
once
for
every
year
of
the
deceased
s
age
and
as
deaths
usually
occur
at
night
we
were
frequently
wakened
from
sleep
by
its
deep
and
solemn
tones
when
i
was
yet
a
very
little
boy
i
occasionally
went
with
my
father
to
toll
the
bell
when
news
came
that
some
one
was
dead
for
we
lived
nearer
the
place
than
any
of
the
others
and
when
the
strokes
ran
up
to
forty
and
fifty
it
was
very
dreary
work
and
i
sat
alone
in
the
church
wondering
who
would
ring
for
me
and
how
many
strokes
could
be
counted
by
those
who
were
shivering
at
home
in
their
beds
the
house
was
built
the
first
year
of
the
settlement
and
the
understanding
was
that
my
father
contributed
the
little
money
necessary
and
superintended
the
work
in
which
he
was
assisted
by
any
one
who
volunteered
his
labor
it
was
his
original
intention
to
build
it
alone
and
the
little
help
he
received
only
irritated
him
as
it
was
not
worth
the
boast
that
he
had
raised
a
temple
to
the
lord
all
the
carpenter
s
work
and
all
the
plasterer
s
work
he
performed
without
assistance
except
from
members
of
his
own
household
but
i
believe
the
people
turned
out
to
the
raising
and
helped
put
up
the
frames
regularly
after
its
completion
he
occupied
the
rough
pulpit
which
he
built
with
especial
reference
to
his
own
size
and
every
lord
s
day
morning
and
evening
preached
a
religion
to
the
people
which
i
think
added
to
their
other
discomforts
for
it
was
hard
and
unforgiving
there
were
two
or
three
kinds
of
baptists
among
the
people
of
fairview
when
the
house
was
completed
and
a
few
presbyterians
but
they
all
became
methodists
without
revolt
or
question
when
my
father
announced
in
his
first
preaching
that
fairview
would
be
of
that
denomination
he
did
not
solicit
them
to
join
him
though
he
probably
intimated
in
a
way
which
admitted
of
no
discussion
that
the
few
heretics
yet
remaining
out
in
the
world
had
better
save
themselves
before
it
was
too
late
it
did
not
seem
to
occur
to
him
that
men
and
women
who
had
grown
up
in
a
certain
faith
renounced
it
with
difficulty
it
was
enough
that
they
were
wrong
and
that
he
was
forgiving
enough
to
throw
open
the
doors
of
the
accepted
church
if
they
were
humiliated
he
was
glad
of
it
for
that
was
necessary
to
condone
their
transgression
if
they
had
arguments
to
excuse
it
he
did
not
care
to
hear
them
as
he
had
taken
god
into
partnership
and
built
fairview
and
people
who
worshipped
there
would
be
expected
to
throw
aside
all
doctrinal
nonsense
as
i
shall
have
something
to
do
with
this
narrative
there
may
be
a
curiosity
on
the
part
of
the
reader
to
know
who
i
am
i
state
then
that
i
am
the
only
son
of
the
rev
john
westlock
and
the
only
child
unless
a
little
girl
born
a
year
before
me
and
whom
i
have
heard
my
mother
speak
of
tenderly
as
pretty
and
is
to
be
called
up
from
her
grave
and
counted
and
i
have
the
best
of
reason
for
believing
the
evidence
being
my
father
s
word
a
man
whose
integrity
was
never
doubted
that
he
moved
to
the
place
where
my
recollection
begins
to
do
good
and
grow
up
with
the
country
whether
my
father
remarked
it
in
my
presence
he
seldom
said
anything
to
me
i
do
not
now
remember
but
i
believe
to
this
day
in
the
absence
of
anything
to
the
contrary
that
the
circuit
he
rode
in
the
country
which
he
had
left
was
poor
and
paid
him
but
rarely
for
his
services
which
induced
him
to
quit
preaching
as
a
business
and
resolve
to
evangelize
in
the
west
on
his
own
account
at
the
same
time
putting
himself
in
the
way
of
growing
up
with
the
country
an
idea
probably
new
at
that
time
and
very
significant
in
the
great
bible
which
was
always
lying
open
on
a
table
in
our
house
between
the
old
and
the
new
testament
my
name
and
the
date
of
my
birth
were
recorded
in
bold
handwriting
immediately
following
the
information
that
helen
elizabeth
westlock
arrived
by
the
mercy
of
god
on
the
of
july
and
departed
in
like
manner
on
the
of
april
and
i
did
not
know
until
i
was
old
enough
to
read
for
myself
that
i
had
been
christened
abram
nedrow
westlock
as
i
had
always
been
called
ned
and
had
often
wondered
if
any
of
the
prophets
were
of
that
name
for
my
father
and
my
mother
and
my
uncle
jo
my
mother
s
only
brother
who
had
lived
at
our
house
most
of
his
life
and
my
grandmother
and
my
grandfather
were
all
named
for
some
of
the
people
i
had
heard
referred
to
when
the
big
bible
was
read
but
when
i
found
abram
before
the
nedrow
i
knew
that
i
had
not
been
neglected
this
discovery
caused
me
to
ask
my
mother
so
many
questions
that
i
learned
in
addition
that
the
nedrow
part
of
the
name
referred
to
a
preacher
of
my
father
s
denomination
and
not
to
a
prophet
and
that
my
father
admired
him
and
named
me
for
him
because
he
had
once
preached
all
day
at
a
and
then
spent
most
of
the
following
night
in
prayer
i
therefore
concluded
that
it
was
intended
that
i
should
be
pious
and
early
began
to
search
the
scriptures
for
the
name
of
abram
that
i
might
know
in
what
manner
he
had
distinguished
himself
the
first
thing
i
can
remember
and
this
only
indistinctly
was
connected
with
the
removal
of
our
effects
from
an
old
house
to
a
new
one
and
that
the
book
on
which
i
usually
sat
at
the
table
was
mislaid
during
the
day
which
made
it
necessary
for
me
to
stand
during
the
progress
of
the
evening
meal
i
began
to
cry
when
this
announcement
was
made
whereupon
my
father
said
in
a
stern
way
that
i
was
now
too
old
to
cry
and
that
i
must
never
do
it
again
i
remarked
it
that
day
if
i
never
did
before
that
he
was
a
large
man
whom
it
would
likely
be
dangerous
to
trifle
with
and
that
a
full
set
of
black
whiskers
and
a
blacker
frown
completely
covered
his
face
from
that
time
i
began
to
remember
events
and
they
will
appear
as
this
narrative
progresses
of
my
youth
before
this
time
i
have
little
knowledge
except
that
my
mother
said
once
in
my
presence
that
i
was
a
very
pretty
baby
but
that
i
had
now
got
bravely
over
it
and
that
as
a
child
i
was
known
in
all
the
country
round
as
a
great
baby
to
cry
being
possessed
of
a
stout
pair
of
lungs
which
i
used
on
the
slightest
occasion
this
coupled
with
an
observation
from
my
uncle
jo
that
when
he
first
saw
me
an
hour
or
two
after
birth
i
looked
like
a
was
all
i
could
find
out
about
my
earlier
history
and
the
investigation
was
so
unsatisfactory
that
i
gave
it
up
once
i
heard
my
father
say
when
he
was
in
a
good
humor
that
when
the
nurse
employed
for
my
arrival
announced
that
i
was
a
boy
my
mother
cried
hysterically
for
half
an
hour
as
she
desired
a
girl
to
replace
the
one
she
had
buried
and
when
i
heard
my
mother
tell
a
few
weeks
afterwards
in
a
burst
of
confidence
to
a
number
of
women
who
happened
to
be
there
that
my
father
stormed
for
an
hour
because
i
was
born
at
all
i
concluded
that
i
had
never
been
very
welcome
and
regretted
that
i
had
ever
come
into
the
world
they
both
wanted
a
girl
when
the
event
was
inevitable
to
help
about
the
house
as
jo
was
thought
to
be
all
the
help
necessary
in
the
field
and
in
the
earlier
days
of
my
life
i
remember
feeling
that
i
was
out
of
place
because
i
did
not
wear
dresses
and
wash
dishes
thus
saving
the
pittance
paid
a
farmer
s
daughter
during
the
busy
season
the
only
remarkable
thing
i
ever
did
in
my
life
i
may
as
well
mention
it
here
and
be
rid
of
it
was
to
learn
to
read
letters
when
i
was
five
years
old
and
as
the
ability
to
read
even
print
was
by
no
means
a
common
accomplishment
in
fairview
this
circumstance
gave
me
great
notoriety
i
no
doubt
learned
to
read
from
curiosity
as
to
what
the
books
and
papers
scattered
about
were
for
as
no
one
took
the
pains
to
teach
me
for
i
remember
that
they
were
all
greatly
surprised
when
i
began
to
spell
words
and
pronounce
them
and
i
am
certain
i
was
never
encouraged
in
it
it
was
the
custom
when
my
father
went
to
the
nearest
to
bring
back
with
him
the
mail
of
the
entire
neighborhood
and
it
was
my
business
to
deliver
the
letters
and
papers
at
the
different
houses
if
i
carried
letters
i
was
requested
to
read
them
and
the
surprise
which
i
created
in
this
direction
was
so
pronounced
that
it
was
generally
said
that
in
time
i
should
certainly
become
a
great
man
and
be
invited
to
teach
school
if
i
came
to
a
word
which
i
did
not
understand
i
invented
one
to
take
its
place
or
an
entire
sentence
for
but
few
of
the
people
could
read
the
letters
themselves
and
never
detected
the
deception
this
occupation
gave
me
my
first
impression
of
the
country
where
the
people
had
lived
before
they
came
to
fairview
and
as
there
was
much
in
the
letters
of
hard
work
and
pinching
poverty
i
believed
that
the
writers
lived
in
a
heavily
timbered
country
where
it
was
necessary
to
dig
up
trees
to
get
room
for
planting
another
thing
i
noticed
was
that
they
all
seemed
to
be
dissatisfied
and
anxious
to
get
away
and
when
in
course
of
time
i
began
to
write
answers
to
the
letters
i
was
surprised
to
learn
that
the
people
of
fairview
were
satisfied
and
that
they
were
well
pleased
with
the
change
i
had
never
thought
this
before
for
they
all
seemed
as
miserable
as
was
possible
and
wondered
about
it
a
great
deal
this
gave
me
fresh
reason
for
believing
that
the
country
which
our
people
had
left
was
a
very
unfavored
one
and
when
i
saw
the
wagons
in
the
road
i
thought
that
at
last
the
writers
of
the
letters
i
had
been
reading
had
arrived
and
would
settle
on
some
of
the
great
tracts
of
prairie
which
could
be
seen
in
every
direction
but
they
turned
the
bend
in
the
road
and
went
on
as
if
a
look
at
fairview
had
frightened
them
and
they
were
going
back
another
way
it
seems
to
me
now
that
between
the
time
i
began
to
remember
and
the
time
i
went
out
with
my
father
and
jo
to
work
or
went
alone
through
the
field
to
attend
the
school
in
the
church
about
a
year
elapsed
and
that
i
was
very
much
alone
during
the
interval
for
ours
was
a
busy
family
and
none
of
them
had
time
to
look
after
me
my
father
and
jo
went
to
the
fields
or
away
with
the
teams
at
a
very
early
hour
in
the
morning
and
usually
did
not
return
until
night
and
my
mother
was
always
busy
about
the
house
so
that
if
i
kept
out
of
mischief
no
more
was
expected
of
me
i
think
it
was
during
this
year
it
may
have
been
two
years
but
certainly
not
a
longer
period
that
i
learned
to
read
for
i
had
nothing
else
to
do
and
no
companions
and
from
looking
at
the
pictures
in
the
books
i
began
to
wonder
what
the
little
characters
surrounding
them
meant
in
this
i
was
assisted
by
jo
who
seemed
to
know
everything
and
by
slow
degrees
i
put
the
letters
together
to
make
words
and
understood
them
sometimes
in
the
middle
of
the
day
i
slipped
out
into
the
field
to
ask
him
the
meaning
of
something
mysterious
i
had
encountered
and
although
he
would
inform
me
i
noticed
that
he
and
my
father
worked
without
speaking
and
that
i
seemed
to
be
an
annoyance
so
i
scampered
back
to
my
loneliness
again
during
this
time
too
i
first
noticed
that
my
father
was
not
like
other
men
who
came
to
our
house
for
he
was
always
grave
and
quiet
and
had
little
to
say
at
any
time
it
was
a
relief
to
me
to
hear
him
ask
blessings
at
the
table
and
pray
morning
and
evening
for
i
seldom
heard
his
voice
at
any
other
time
i
believe
i
regarded
his
quiet
manner
only
as
an
evidence
that
he
was
more
pious
than
others
of
his
class
for
i
could
make
nothing
else
out
of
it
but
often
regretted
that
his
religion
did
not
permit
him
to
notice
me
more
or
to
take
me
with
him
when
he
went
away
in
the
wagon
once
i
asked
my
mother
why
he
was
always
so
stern
and
silent
and
if
it
was
because
we
had
offended
him
to
which
she
replied
all
in
a
tremble
that
she
did
not
know
herself
and
i
thought
that
she
studied
a
great
deal
about
him
too
my
mother
was
as
timid
in
his
presence
as
i
was
and
during
the
day
if
i
came
upon
her
suddenly
she
looked
frightened
thinking
it
was
he
but
when
she
found
it
was
not
her
composure
returned
again
neither
of
us
had
reason
to
be
afraid
of
him
i
am
certain
of
that
but
as
we
never
seemed
able
to
please
him
though
he
never
said
so
we
were
in
constant
dread
of
displeasing
him
more
than
ever
or
of
causing
him
to
become
more
silent
and
dissatisfied
and
to
give
up
the
short
prayers
in
which
we
were
graciously
mentioned
for
a
blessing
the
house
where
we
lived
and
into
which
we
moved
on
the
day
when
my
recollection
begins
was
the
largest
in
the
settlement
a
square
house
of
two
stories
painted
so
white
that
after
night
it
looked
like
a
ghost
it
was
built
on
lower
ground
than
fairview
church
though
the
location
was
sightly
and
not
far
away
ran
a
stream
fringed
with
thickets
of
brush
where
i
found
the
panting
cattle
and
sheep
on
hot
days
and
thought
they
gave
me
more
of
a
welcome
than
my
father
and
jo
did
in
the
field
for
they
were
not
busy
but
idle
like
me
and
i
hoped
it
was
rather
a
relief
to
them
to
look
at
me
in
wonder
beyond
the
little
stream
and
the
pasture
was
the
great
dusty
road
and
in
my
loneliness
i
often
sat
on
the
high
fence
beside
it
to
watch
for
the
coming
of
the
movers
wagons
and
to
look
curiously
at
those
stowed
away
under
the
cover
bows
tumbled
together
with
luggage
and
effects
of
every
kind
if
one
of
the
drivers
asked
me
how
far
it
was
to
the
country
town
i
supposed
he
had
heard
of
my
wonderful
learning
and
took
great
pains
to
describe
the
road
as
i
had
heard
my
father
do
a
hundred
times
in
response
to
similar
inquiries
from
movers
sometimes
i
climbed
up
to
the
driver
s
seat
and
drove
with
him
out
to
the
prairie
and
i
always
noticed
that
the
women
and
children
riding
behind
were
poorly
dressed
and
tired
looking
and
i
wondered
if
only
the
unfortunate
travelled
our
way
for
only
that
kind
of
people
lived
in
fairview
and
i
had
never
seen
any
other
kind
in
the
road
when
i
think
of
the
years
i
lived
in
fairview
i
imagine
that
the
sun
was
never
bright
there
although
i
am
certain
that
it
was
and
i
can
not
relieve
my
mind
of
the
impression
that
the
cold
changing
shadow
of
the
gray
church
has
spread
during
my
long
absence
and
enveloped
all
the
houses
where
the
people
lived
when
i
see
fairview
in
my
fancy
now
it
is
always
from
a
high
place
and
looking
down
upon
it
the
shadow
is
denser
around
the
house
where
i
lived
than
anywhere
else
so
that
i
feel
to
this
day
that
should
i
visit
it
and
receive
permission
from
the
new
owners
to
walk
through
the
rooms
i
should
find
the
walls
damp
and
mouldy
because
the
bright
sun
and
the
free
air
of
heaven
had
deserted
them
as
a
curse
chapter
ii
the
hell
question
and
the
rev
john
westlock
my
father
s
religion
would
have
been
unsatisfactory
without
a
hell
it
was
a
part
of
his
hope
of
the
future
that
worldly
men
who
scoffed
at
his
piety
would
be
punished
and
this
was
as
much
a
part
of
his
expectation
as
that
those
who
were
faithful
to
the
end
would
be
rewarded
everybody
saved
to
my
father
s
thinking
was
as
bad
as
nobody
saved
and
in
his
bible
not
a
passage
for
pleasurable
contemplation
which
intimated
universal
salvation
was
marked
if
such
exists
the
sacrifices
he
made
for
religion
were
tasks
and
his
reward
was
a
conviction
that
those
who
refused
to
make
them
would
be
punished
for
he
regarded
it
as
an
injustice
of
which
the
creator
was
incapable
to
do
as
well
by
his
enemies
as
by
his
friends
i
believe
that
he
would
rather
have
gone
to
heaven
without
the
members
of
his
family
than
with
them
unless
they
had
earned
salvation
as
he
had
earned
it
and
travelled
as
steadily
as
himself
the
hard
road
marked
on
his
map
as
leading
heavenward
one
of
the
best
evidences
to
his
mind
of
a
compassionate
and
loving
saviour
was
the
belief
that
all
thought
of
unfortunate
friends
in
torment
was
blotted
from
the
memory
of
the
redeemed
and
the
lake
of
fire
he
thought
of
as
a
remedy
for
the
great
number
of
disagreeable
people
with
whom
he
was
compelled
to
come
in
contact
below
and
of
whom
he
would
be
happily
rid
above
religion
was
a
misery
to
be
endured
on
earth
that
a
reward
might
be
enjoyed
after
death
a
man
must
spend
the
ages
of
his
future
either
in
a
very
pleasant
place
with
comfortable
surroundings
and
pleasant
associates
or
in
a
very
unpleasant
place
with
uncomfortable
surroundings
and
all
the
mean
people
turned
into
devils
and
imps
for
companions
it
was
the
inevitable
law
every
man
of
moderate
sense
should
be
able
to
appreciate
the
situation
at
a
glance
and
do
that
which
would
insure
his
personal
safety
if
there
was
a
doubt
the
thought
was
too
absurd
for
his
contemplation
but
admitting
a
doubt
his
future
would
be
equal
to
that
of
the
worldly
man
for
one
can
not
rot
more
easily
than
another
or
be
more
comfortable
as
dust
but
if
there
was
no
doubt
and
all
the
authorities
agree
that
there
was
none
then
the
difference
would
be
in
his
favor
it
was
the
best
thing
offering
under
the
circumstances
and
should
therefore
be
accepted
without
hesitation
if
the
conditions
were
hard
he
could
not
help
it
he
might
have
suggested
changes
in
the
plan
of
salvation
had
his
judgment
been
invited
but
the
plan
had
been
formulated
before
his
time
and
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
but
obedience
if
he
thought
he
deserved
credit
for
all
he
possessed
and
he
was
a
man
very
likely
to
be
seized
with
that
suspicion
the
bible
said
it
came
from
god
that
settled
the
matter
finally
and
forever
he
gave
thanks
for
a
punishment
was
provided
if
he
did
not
and
a
reward
if
he
did
and
pretended
to
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
accumulating
his
property
religion
was
a
matter
of
thrift
and
as
much
as
laying
away
money
in
youth
and
strength
for
old
age
and
helplessness
and
he
called
upon
sinners
to
flee
the
wrath
to
come
because
he
had
been
commanded
to
go
out
and
preach
to
all
the
world
for
it
mattered
little
to
him
whether
the
people
were
saved
or
not
they
had
eyes
therefore
let
them
see
ears
therefore
let
them
hear
the
danger
was
so
plain
that
they
ought
to
save
themselves
without
solicitation
that
which
he
most
desired
seldom
came
to
pass
that
which
he
dreaded
frequently
but
no
matter
he
gave
thanks
to
the
lord
because
it
was
best
to
do
so
and
asked
no
questions
there
were
jewels
for
those
who
earned
them
and
as
a
thrifty
man
he
desired
a
greater
number
of
these
than
any
other
citizen
of
fairview
he
was
the
principal
man
in
his
neighborhood
below
and
desired
to
be
a
shepherd
rather
than
a
sheep
above
therefore
he
was
foremost
in
the
church
and
allowed
no
one
to
be
more
zealous
in
doing
the
service
of
the
hard
master
he
had
after
careful
thought
and
study
set
out
to
serve
believing
the
reward
worth
the
service
and
determined
to
serve
well
if
he
served
at
all
as
was
his
custom
in
everything
else
if
i
do
him
an
injustice
i
do
not
intend
it
but
i
have
thought
all
my
life
that
he
regarded
children
as
troublesome
and
expensive
a
practical
sort
of
punishment
for
sin
sent
from
time
to
time
as
the
case
seemed
to
require
and
that
he
had
been
burdened
with
but
two
was
no
doubt
evidence
to
his
mind
that
his
life
had
been
generally
blameless
if
indeed
this
opinion
was
not
confirmed
by
the
circumstance
that
one
of
them
had
been
taken
from
him
in
return
for
good
service
in
the
holy
cause
once
they
had
arrived
however
he
accepted
the
trust
to
return
them
to
their
maker
as
nearly
like
they
came
as
possible
for
that
was
commanded
of
him
because
he
frequently
referred
to
the
road
to
heaven
as
narrow
and
difficult
and
the
highway
in
the
other
direction
as
broad
and
easy
i
came
to
believe
that
but
for
his
religion
he
would
have
been
a
man
much
given
to
and
ambitious
for
distinction
but
he
put
such
thoughts
aside
and
toiled
away
at
his
work
as
if
to
get
out
of
temptation
s
way
when
he
talked
of
the
broad
and
easy
road
it
was
with
a
relish
as
though
he
could
enjoy
the
pleasant
places
by
the
if
he
dared
and
in
his
preaching
i
think
he
described
the
pleasures
of
the
world
so
vividly
that
his
hearers
were
taken
with
a
wish
to
enjoy
them
though
it
is
not
probable
that
he
knew
anything
about
them
except
from
hearsay
as
he
had
always
been
out
of
temptation
s
way
in
the
backwoods
during
his
boyhood
and
on
the
prairie
during
his
maturer
years
but
when
he
talked
of
the
narrow
and
difficult
path
his
manner
changed
at
once
a
frown
came
upon
his
face
he
looked
determined
and
unforgiving
and
at
every
point
he
seemed
to
build
marked
duty
it
has
occurred
to
me
since
that
he
thought
of
his
religion
as
a
vigorous
healthy
successful
man
thinks
in
his
quiet
moments
of
a
wife
sick
since
their
marriage
although
he
may
deserve
a
different
fate
and
desire
it
he
dares
not
complain
for
the
more
wearisome
the
invalid
the
louder
the
call
of
duty
i
think
he
disliked
the
necessity
of
being
religious
and
only
accepted
and
taught
religion
because
he
believed
it
to
be
the
best
thing
to
do
for
it
did
not
afford
him
the
peace
he
professed
to
all
appearances
he
was
a
most
miserable
man
although
he
taught
that
only
the
sinful
are
miserable
and
the
few
acquaintances
he
had
who
were
not
equally
devout
strangers
passing
through
or
those
he
met
at
the
country
town
for
all
were
pious
in
fairview
lived
an
easy
and
contented
life
which
he
seemed
to
covet
but
nobody
knew
it
for
he
reproved
them
with
all
the
more
vigor
because
of
his
envy
when
not
engaged
in
reading
at
night
as
was
his
custom
he
sat
for
hours
looking
steadily
into
the
fire
and
was
impatient
if
disturbed
i
never
knew
what
occupied
his
thoughts
at
these
times
it
may
have
been
his
preaching
or
his
daily
work
but
more
likely
he
was
seeing
glimpses
of
forbidden
pictures
caravans
of
coveted
things
passing
in
procession
or
of
hopes
and
ambitious
dwarfed
by
duty
perhaps
in
fancy
he
was
out
in
the
world
mingling
with
people
of
a
class
more
to
his
taste
than
fairview
afforded
and
was
thinking
he
could
enjoy
their
pleasures
and
occupations
if
they
were
not
forbidden
or
wondering
if
after
all
his
principles
were
not
mistakes
i
believe
that
during
these
hours
of
silent
thinking
he
was
tempted
and
beckoned
by
the
invisible
and
mysteriously
potent
forces
he
pretended
to
despise
and
that
he
was
convinced
that
to
push
them
off
his
religion
must
be
made
more
rigorous
and
pitiless
that
he
coveted
riches
could
be
easily
seen
and
but
for
his
fear
of
conscience
he
could
have
easily
possessed
himself
of
everything
worth
owning
in
fairview
for
with
the
exception
of
theodore
meek
the
next
best
man
in
the
neighborhood
he
was
about
the
only
one
among
the
people
who
read
books
and
subscribed
for
newspapers
none
of
them
was
his
equal
in
intelligence
or
energy
and
had
he
desired
he
could
have
traded
them
out
of
what
little
they
possessed
and
sold
it
back
again
at
a
comfortable
profit
but
do
unto
others
as
you
would
have
others
do
unto
you
was
commanded
of
him
by
his
inexorable
master
and
he
was
called
upon
to
help
the
weak
rather
than
rob
them
therefore
he
often
gave
them
assistance
which
he
could
but
poorly
afford
this
limited
him
so
much
that
he
had
no
other
hope
of
becoming
than
that
the
lands
which
he
was
constantly
buying
would
finally
become
valuable
by
reason
of
the
development
and
settlement
of
the
country
this
he
regarded
as
honorable
and
fair
and
to
this
work
he
applied
himself
with
great
energy
i
heard
little
of
his
father
except
that
he
was
noted
where
he
lived
as
a
man
of
large
family
who
provided
them
all
with
warm
clothes
in
winter
and
plenty
to
eat
all
the
year
round
his
early
history
was
probably
as
unimportant
and
eventless
as
my
own
he
seldom
mentioned
his
father
to
any
one
except
in
connection
with
a
story
which
he
occasionally
told
that
once
when
his
house
was
on
fire
he
called
so
loud
for
help
that
he
was
heard
a
mile
evidently
the
son
succeeded
to
this
extraordinary
pair
of
lungs
for
he
sang
the
religious
songs
common
in
that
day
with
such
excellence
that
no
man
attempted
to
equal
him
while
his
singing
was
strong
and
loud
it
was
melodious
and
he
had
as
great
a
reputation
for
that
as
for
piety
and
thrift
his
was
a
voice
though
he
occasionally
sang
songs
of
little
children
as
moses
in
the
bulrushes
of
which
there
were
verses
and
the
cradle
song
commencing
hush
my
dear
lie
still
and
slumber
written
by
a
noted
otherwise
my
father
would
not
have
patronized
him
besides
a
thorough
familiarity
with
all
the
common
long
short
and
particular
metres
he
had
a
collection
of
religious
songs
preserved
in
a
book
the
notes
being
written
in
buckwheat
characters
on
blue
paper
fast
turning
yellow
with
age
and
the
words
on
the
opposite
page
feeling
the
necessity
of
a
knowledge
of
notes
once
he
had
learned
the
art
in
a
few
weeks
in
his
usual
vigorous
way
and
sang
at
sight
and
after
that
he
preserved
his
old
songs
and
all
the
new
ones
he
fancied
in
the
book
i
have
mentioned
the
songs
to
which
i
refer
i
have
never
seen
in
print
and
he
sang
them
on
special
occasions
as
at
a
when
a
tiresome
preacher
had
allowed
the
interest
to
flag
behold
paul
a
prisoner
a
complete
history
of
the
apostle
requiring
almost
an
afternoon
in
its
performance
or
christ
in
the
garden
nearly
as
long
never
failed
to
start
the
interest
anew
in
an
emergency
and
if
the
case
were
very
desperate
he
called
the
members
of
his
family
into
the
pulpit
and
sang
a
quartet
called
the
glorious
eighth
of
april
using
for
the
words
the
first
hymn
in
the
book
this
was
usually
sufficient
to
start
some
one
to
shouting
and
after
a
short
prayer
he
preached
as
vigorously
and
loudly
as
he
sang
and
with
an
equally
good
effect
of
his
brothers
and
sisters
although
he
had
a
great
number
he
seldom
talked
and
i
scarcely
knew
the
names
of
the
states
in
which
they
lived
as
they
were
scattered
in
every
direction
i
had
heard
him
mention
a
samuel
a
joseph
a
jacob
an
elias
a
rebecca
a
sarah
a
rachel
and
an
elizabeth
from
which
i
came
to
believe
that
my
grandfather
was
a
religious
man
his
own
name
was
amos
and
i
once
heard
that
his
children
on
sundays
carried
their
shoes
to
the
brook
near
the
before
putting
them
on
that
they
might
last
the
longer
which
confirmed
the
belief
that
there
had
been
religion
in
his
family
as
there
was
in
ours
of
his
mother
he
said
nothing
at
all
and
if
they
had
neighbors
he
never
mentioned
them
in
short
he
did
not
seem
proud
of
his
family
which
caused
us
to
wonder
why
he
was
so
much
like
his
father
which
we
had
come
to
believe
without
exactly
knowing
why
we
were
certain
he
was
like
his
father
in
religion
in
the
hard
way
in
which
he
worked
in
his
capacity
to
mend
his
own
ploughs
and
wagons
and
in
the
easy
manner
in
which
he
adapted
himself
to
his
surroundings
whatever
they
were
for
in
all
these
particulars
he
was
unlike
any
other
man
we
had
ever
known
and
different
from
his
neighbors
who
spent
half
a
day
in
asking
advice
in
a
matter
which
could
be
remedied
in
half
an
hour
the
people
came
to
our
house
from
miles
around
to
borrow
and
to
ask
the
best
time
to
plant
and
to
sow
but
the
rev
john
westlock
asked
advice
of
no
one
and
never
borrowed
if
he
needed
an
extra
harrow
he
made
one
of
wood
to
answer
until
such
a
time
as
he
could
trade
to
advantage
for
a
better
one
if
he
broke
a
plough
he
managed
somehow
to
mend
it
until
a
rainy
day
came
when
he
made
it
as
good
as
new
even
in
cases
of
sickness
he
usually
had
a
bottle
hid
away
that
contained
relief
and
in
all
other
things
was
equally
capable
and
thrifty
if
it
be
to
the
credit
of
a
man
to
say
that
he
was
a
slave
to
hard
work
i
cheerfully
add
this
testimony
to
the
greatness
of
my
father
for
he
went
to
the
field
at
daylight
only
to
return
with
the
darkness
winter
and
summer
alike
and
never
in
my
life
have
i
seen
him
idle
except
on
the
day
appointed
for
rest
and
even
then
he
devoured
the
bible
like
a
man
reading
at
so
much
per
page
he
worked
hard
when
he
preached
talking
rapidly
that
he
might
accomplish
as
much
as
possible
before
the
people
became
impatient
and
he
no
sooner
finished
one
song
of
warning
than
he
began
another
my
father
being
large
and
positive
it
followed
naturally
that
my
mother
was
small
and
weak
and
thoroughly
under
his
control
i
don
t
think
she
was
afraid
of
him
but
he
managed
his
own
affairs
so
well
that
she
was
willing
he
should
manage
hers
as
he
had
given
her
good
reason
to
respect
his
judgment
she
probably
argued
if
she
argued
the
question
at
all
that
as
his
ideas
were
good
in
everything
else
he
would
of
course
know
how
to
manage
a
boy
so
my
bringing
up
was
left
entirely
to
him
she
never
corrected
me
except
to
say
that
father
would
not
like
what
i
was
doing
and
she
might
find
it
necessary
to
call
his
attention
to
it
but
in
the
goodness
of
her
heart
she
forgot
it
and
never
told
him
unless
the
offence
was
a
very
grave
one
while
she
frequently
pleaded
with
me
to
be
good
and
cried
in
vexation
if
i
would
not
she
never
gave
commands
which
were
enforced
with
severe
punishments
as
he
did
therefore
i
am
afraid
that
i
did
not
appreciate
her
kindness
and
favor
but
rather
enjoyed
my
freedom
when
under
her
care
as
a
respite
from
restraint
at
other
times
she
was
as
quiet
and
thoughtful
as
her
husband
but
seemed
sad
rather
than
angry
and
discontented
as
was
the
case
with
him
and
it
will
be
readily
imagined
that
as
a
family
we
were
not
much
given
to
happiness
while
i
never
heard
my
father
speak
harshly
to
her
he
was
often
impatient
as
though
he
regretted
he
had
not
married
a
wife
as
ambitious
and
capable
as
himself
but
if
he
thought
of
it
he
gave
it
no
other
attention
than
to
become
more
gloomy
and
pacified
himself
by
reading
far
into
the
night
without
speaking
to
any
one
i
could
find
no
fault
with
him
except
that
he
never
spoke
kindly
to
me
and
it
annoyed
him
if
i
asked
him
questions
concerning
what
i
read
in
his
books
when
jo
and
i
worked
with
him
in
the
field
which
we
both
began
to
do
very
early
in
life
he
always
did
that
which
was
hardest
and
most
disagreeable
and
was
not
a
tyrant
in
anything
save
the
ungrumbling
obedience
he
exacted
to
whatever
he
thought
about
the
matter
in
hand
without
reference
to
what
others
thought
on
the
same
subject
we
had
to
be
at
something
steadily
whether
it
helped
him
or
not
because
he
believed
idle
boys
grew
up
into
idle
men
other
boys
in
the
neighborhood
built
the
early
fires
and
did
the
early
feeding
but
he
preferred
to
do
these
things
himself
whether
out
of
consideration
for
us
or
because
it
was
troublesome
to
drive
us
to
it
i
do
not
know
after
starting
the
fire
in
the
room
in
which
he
slept
he
stepped
to
our
door
and
told
us
to
get
up
to
which
command
we
mumblingly
replied
and
slept
on
after
returning
from
the
stables
he
spoke
to
us
again
but
we
still
paid
no
attention
ten
minutes
later
he
would
start
up
the
stairs
with
angry
strides
but
he
never
caught
us
for
we
knew
that
was
final
and
hurried
on
our
clothes
seeing
that
we
were
up
and
dressing
when
he
reached
the
head
of
the
stairs
he
would
say
well
you
d
better
and
go
down
again
where
we
speedily
followed
this
was
his
regular
custom
for
years
we
always
expected
it
of
him
and
were
never
disappointed
after
the
morning
devotions
which
consisted
of
reading
a
chapter
from
the
bible
and
a
prayer
always
expressed
in
exactly
the
same
words
he
asked
a
blessing
for
the
meal
by
this
time
ready
the
blessing
was
as
unvarying
as
the
prayer
and
we
ate
in
silence
then
we
were
warmly
clothed
if
it
was
winter
and
compelled
to
go
out
and
work
until
we
were
hungry
again
i
suppose
we
helped
him
little
enough
but
his
reasoning
convinced
him
that
to
work
easily
and
naturally
work
must
become
a
habit
and
should
be
taught
from
youth
up
therefore
we
went
out
with
him
every
day
and
came
back
only
with
the
darkness
i
think
he
was
kinder
with
us
when
at
work
than
at
any
other
time
and
we
admired
him
in
spite
of
the
hard
and
exacting
tasks
he
gave
us
to
do
he
called
them
stints
for
he
was
powerful
and
quick
to
aid
us
when
we
needed
it
and
tender
as
a
child
if
we
were
sick
sometimes
on
cold
days
we
walked
rather
than
rode
to
the
timber
where
my
father
went
to
chop
wood
while
jo
and
i
corded
it
on
one
of
these
occasions
i
became
ill
while
returning
home
at
night
a
slight
difficulty
it
must
have
been
for
i
was
always
stout
and
robust
and
he
carried
me
all
the
way
in
his
arms
though
i
insisted
i
could
walk
and
was
better
he
said
i
was
not
heavy
and
trudged
along
like
a
great
giant
holding
me
so
tenderly
that
i
thought
for
the
first
time
that
perhaps
he
loved
me
for
weeks
after
that
i
tried
as
hard
as
i
could
to
please
him
and
to
induce
him
to
commend
my
work
but
he
never
did
for
whether
i
was
good
or
bad
he
was
just
the
same
silent
and
grave
so
that
if
i
became
indifferent
in
my
tasks
i
fear
he
was
the
cause
of
it
other
families
had
their
holidays
and
owned
guns
and
dogs
which
they
used
in
hunting
the
wild
game
then
so
abundant
but
there
was
little
of
this
at
our
house
and
perhaps
this
was
the
reason
why
we
prospered
more
than
those
around
us
usually
jo
and
i
were
given
the
saturday
afternoons
to
ourselves
when
we
roamed
the
country
with
some
of
the
idle
vagabonds
who
lived
in
rented
houses
visiting
turkey
roosts
a
great
distance
in
the
woods
and
only
returning
long
after
i
do
not
remember
that
we
were
ever
idle
in
the
middle
of
the
week
unless
we
were
sent
on
errands
as
buying
young
stock
at
low
prices
of
the
less
thrifty
neighbors
or
something
else
in
which
there
was
profit
so
that
we
had
little
time
to
learn
anything
except
hard
work
and
if
we
learned
that
well
it
was
because
we
were
excellently
taught
by
a
competent
master
during
those
years
work
became
such
a
habit
with
me
that
ever
since
it
has
clung
to
me
and
perhaps
after
all
it
was
an
inheritance
for
which
i
have
reason
to
be
thankful
i
remember
my
father
s
saying
scornfully
to
me
once
as
if
intimating
that
i
ought
to
make
up
by
unusual
industry
for
the
years
of
idleness
that
i
was
a
positive
burden
and
expense
to
him
until
i
was
seven
years
old
so
it
will
readily
be
imagined
that
i
was
put
to
work
early
and
kept
steadily
at
it
chapter
iii
the
house
of
erring
the
friend
and
companion
of
my
boyhood
was
jo
erring
my
mother
s
only
brother
who
had
been
in
the
family
since
before
i
was
born
he
was
five
years
my
senior
and
a
stout
and
ambitious
fellow
i
greatly
admired
but
as
he
was
regularly
flogged
when
i
was
this
circumstance
gave
rise
to
his
first
ambition
to
become
a
man
and
whip
my
father
whom
he
regarded
with
little
favor
there
was
a
kind
of
tradition
that
when
he
became
of
age
he
was
to
have
a
horse
and
ten
dollars
in
money
but
whether
this
was
really
the
price
of
his
work
i
never
knew
more
likely
he
came
to
our
house
with
my
mother
as
he
was
not
wanted
at
home
and
had
lived
there
until
other
disposition
could
be
made
of
him
he
usually
had
a
horse
picked
out
as
the
one
he
desired
and
gave
it
particular
attention
but
as
each
of
these
in
turn
was
disposed
of
at
convenient
opportunity
he
became
more
than
ever
convinced
that
he
was
related
by
marriage
to
a
very
unscrupulous
man
i
remember
him
at
this
period
as
an
overgrown
boy
always
wearing
clothing
either
too
large
or
too
small
for
him
and
the
hero
and
friend
of
every
boy
on
fairview
prairie
although
he
was
the
stoutest
boy
in
the
neighborhood
and
we
often
wondered
that
he
did
not
sometimes
whip
all
the
others
simply
because
he
could
he
never
quarrelled
but
was
in
every
dispute
a
mediator
announcing
his
decisions
in
a
voice
and
hoarse
and
as
he
was
honest
and
just
and
very
stout
there
were
no
appeals
from
his
decisions
in
our
rough
amusements
which
were
few
enough
he
used
his
strength
to
secure
to
the
smaller
ones
their
share
and
gave
way
himself
with
the
same
readiness
that
he
exacted
from
the
others
therefore
he
was
very
popular
among
the
younger
portion
of
the
population
and
there
was
great
joy
at
school
when
it
was
announced
which
pleasure
i
usually
had
that
jo
erring
had
finished
his
winter
s
work
and
was
coming
the
next
day
for
all
forms
of
oppression
must
cease
from
that
date
sometimes
he
came
by
the
school
on
a
winter
evening
with
a
rude
sled
to
which
he
had
young
horses
attached
to
break
them
and
if
the
larger
boys
climbed
on
to
ride
home
or
as
far
as
he
went
he
made
them
all
get
off
and
loading
up
with
those
too
small
to
look
after
their
own
interests
in
the
struggle
drove
gaily
away
with
me
by
his
side
there
were
few
men
more
trusty
than
jo
and
he
always
made
a
round
in
the
after
my
father
had
turned
out
as
if
to
convince
him
that
he
was
mistaken
in
the
opinion
that
boys
were
good
for
nothing
when
there
was
corn
to
gather
he
took
the
slowest
team
and
the
lazy
hired
man
and
brought
in
more
loads
than
my
father
and
i
and
if
i
found
any
way
to
aid
him
in
this
i
always
did
it
they
seemed
to
hate
each
other
in
secret
for
the
master
disliked
a
boy
who
was
able
to
equal
him
in
anything
as
if
his
extra
years
had
availed
him
nothing
and
i
confess
that
my
sympathies
were
always
with
jo
for
the
grown
people
picked
at
him
because
of
his
ambition
to
become
a
man
in
all
other
respects
than
age
a
few
years
sooner
than
was
usual
while
nobody
disputed
that
he
was
a
capable
fellow
he
was
always
attempting
something
he
could
not
carry
out
and
thus
became
a
subject
of
ridicule
in
spite
of
his
worth
and
ability
if
he
was
sent
to
the
timber
for
wood
he
would
volunteer
to
be
back
at
an
impossible
time
and
although
he
returned
sooner
than
most
men
would
have
done
they
laughed
at
him
and
regarded
him
as
a
great
failure
it
was
said
of
him
that
he
exaggerated
but
i
think
that
he
was
only
anxious
that
it
be
known
what
he
could
do
if
he
had
an
opportunity
and
as
every
one
thought
less
of
him
than
he
deserved
he
kept
on
talking
of
himself
to
correct
a
wrong
impression
and
steadily
made
matters
worse
his
activity
kept
him
down
for
another
thing
for
thereby
he
raised
an
opposition
which
would
not
have
existed
had
he
been
content
to
walk
leisurely
along
in
the
tracks
made
by
his
elders
he
accepted
none
of
the
opinions
of
the
fairview
men
and
it
was
said
of
him
that
he
was
a
skeptic
for
no
other
reason
than
that
everybody
else
was
religious
and
i
am
not
certain
but
that
there
was
some
truth
in
this
if
the
truth
of
a
certain
principle
was
asserted
he
denied
it
not
by
rude
controversy
but
by
his
actions
and
by
his
ingenuity
he
often
made
a
poorer
one
seem
better
if
the
one
proposed
happened
to
be
right
as
was
sometimes
the
case
for
the
fairview
people
had
but
two
ways
to
guess
and
occasionally
adopted
a
right
method
instead
of
a
wrong
one
by
accident
i
believe
there
was
nothing
he
could
not
do
he
shingled
hair
in
a
superb
manner
for
any
one
who
applied
and
charged
nothing
for
the
service
and
i
helped
him
learn
the
art
for
he
practised
on
me
so
much
that
i
was
nearly
always
bald
he
made
everything
he
took
a
fancy
for
and
seemed
to
possess
himself
of
the
contents
of
a
book
by
looking
through
it
for
though
i
seldom
found
him
reading
he
was
about
as
as
the
books
themselves
when
the
folks
were
away
at
he
added
my
mother
s
work
to
his
own
and
got
along
very
well
with
it
i
never
heard
of
anything
a
fairview
boy
could
do
better
than
jo
erring
and
he
did
a
great
many
things
in
which
he
had
no
competition
therefore
i
have
often
wondered
that
the
only
young
man
there
who
really
amounted
to
anything
was
for
some
reason
rather
unpopular
jo
was
unfortunate
in
the
particular
that
he
seemed
to
have
inherited
all
the
poorer
qualities
of
both
his
father
and
mother
instead
of
the
good
qualities
of
either
one
of
them
or
a
commendable
trait
from
one
and
an
undesirable
one
from
the
other
i
have
heard
of
men
who
resembled
the
less
worthy
of
their
parents
i
believe
this
is
the
rule
but
never
before
have
i
known
a
boy
to
resemble
both
his
parents
in
everything
they
tried
to
hide
his
tendency
to
exaggeration
he
got
honestly
from
his
mother
who
was
a
fluent
talker
but
jo
was
not
like
her
in
that
in
this
jo
was
like
his
father
who
would
not
say
a
half
dozen
words
without
becoming
hopelessly
entangled
and
making
long
pauses
in
painful
effort
to
extricate
his
meaning
jo
was
often
sent
to
a
in
the
woods
with
a
grist
and
while
waiting
for
his
wheat
or
corn
to
be
ground
he
regarded
the
machinery
with
the
closest
attention
and
at
length
became
impressed
with
the
idea
that
after
he
had
become
a
man
and
whipped
my
father
he
would
like
to
follow
milling
for
a
business
the
miller
an
odd
but
kindly
man
of
whom
but
little
was
known
in
our
part
of
the
country
admired
jo
s
manly
way
and
made
friends
with
him
by
answering
his
questions
and
occasionally
inviting
him
to
his
house
for
dinner
and
jo
talked
so
much
of
his
ambition
and
his
friend
that
he
came
to
be
called
the
miller
and
spent
his
spare
time
in
making
models
and
trying
them
in
the
rivulets
which
ran
through
the
fields
after
a
rain
his
father
s
farm
was
skirted
by
big
creek
and
here
he
picked
out
a
site
for
his
mill
when
he
should
be
able
to
build
it
at
a
place
called
erring
s
ford
the
location
really
did
credit
to
his
judgment
and
having
hauled
a
load
of
stones
there
one
saturday
afternoon
for
a
dam
the
circumstance
gave
rise
to
the
only
pleasantry
ever
known
in
fairview
when
any
one
spoke
of
an
event
not
likely
to
happen
he
said
it
would
probably
come
about
when
the
sky
rained
pitchforks
on
the
roof
of
jo
erring
s
mill
but
jo
paid
little
attention
to
this
banter
and
hauled
more
stones
for
the
dam
whenever
he
had
opportunity
in
which
work
i
assisted
in
preference
to
idleness
without
him
he
hoped
to
become
apprenticed
to
his
friend
the
miller
to
learn
the
business
and
to
complete
his
own
enterprise
by
slow
degrees
from
his
small
savings
and
he
never
lost
sight
of
this
purpose
pursuing
it
so
steadily
that
a
few
of
those
who
at
first
laughed
at
him
spoke
at
length
encouraging
words
and
said
they
believed
he
would
finally
succeed
although
it
would
be
a
long
time
in
coming
about
i
was
secretly
very
fond
of
the
mill
enterprise
and
admired
jo
more
than
ever
that
he
was
bold
enough
to
attempt
carrying
it
out
our
plan
to
run
away
was
altered
by
this
new
interest
and
we
agreed
that
it
would
be
better
to
wait
patiently
until
the
mill
was
complete
and
buy
our
liberty
from
its
profits
for
jo
had
generously
agreed
to
ransom
me
as
well
as
himself
as
soon
as
he
was
able
jo
s
mother
a
very
large
woman
who
was
the
acknowledged
head
of
the
house
of
erring
and
doctor
for
half
that
country
lived
four
miles
from
fairview
church
on
big
creek
in
a
house
of
hewn
logs
the
inside
of
which
was
a
marvel
for
neatness
of
her
husband
the
people
knew
nothing
except
that
he
was
a
and
that
he
was
probably
a
very
wicked
man
for
he
was
about
the
only
one
in
the
settlement
who
did
not
profess
religion
and
attend
the
gatherings
at
the
church
the
calling
of
he
followed
winter
and
summer
and
he
never
seemed
to
raise
anything
on
his
farm
except
a
glassy
kind
of
corn
with
a
great
many
black
grains
in
every
ear
which
he
planted
and
cultivated
with
a
hoe
after
it
was
gathered
he
tied
most
of
it
in
bunches
and
hung
it
up
to
dry
on
the
kitchen
rafters
where
it
was
understood
to
be
for
sale
as
seed
although
i
never
heard
that
it
was
good
for
anything
except
to
parch
and
the
only
use
he
ever
made
of
it
that
i
knew
anything
about
was
to
give
it
to
jo
and
me
with
the
air
of
a
man
conferring
a
great
favor
my
father
liked
nothing
about
dad
erring
except
his
one
virtue
of
attending
to
his
own
business
such
as
it
was
and
said
of
him
that
he
selected
his
piece
of
land
because
it
was
near
a
spring
whereas
the
exercise
of
a
little
energy
would
have
dug
a
well
affording
an
equally
good
supply
of
water
on
vastly
superior
land
indeed
no
one
seemed
to
like
him
and
the
dislike
was
mutual
for
if
he
was
familiar
with
any
one
except
jo
my
mother
and
myself
i
never
knew
of
it
he
seldom
spoke
even
to
my
grandmother
when
i
was
about
and
i
think
only
very
rarely
at
any
other
time
for
they
seemed
never
to
have
recovered
from
some
old
trouble
there
was
this
much
charity
for
him
however
the
people
said
no
more
than
that
he
was
an
exceedingly
odd
sort
of
a
man
a
verdict
true
of
his
appearance
as
well
as
disposition
for
he
was
very
large
very
and
clean
shaven
and
let
him
alone
which
of
all
things
he
probably
most
desired
the
people
frequently
met
him
walking
along
the
road
swinging
a
stout
stick
and
taking
tremendous
strides
he
never
owned
a
horse
but
took
long
journeys
on
foot
refusing
a
ride
if
offered
him
by
a
wagon
going
in
the
same
direction
but
he
did
not
speak
to
them
unless
compelled
and
apparently
had
no
other
desire
than
to
be
let
alone
he
never
went
anywhere
except
to
the
timber
to
make
shingles
and
off
on
excursions
afoot
nobody
knew
whither
from
which
he
always
returned
in
a
few
days
in
exactly
the
same
mood
as
that
in
which
he
had
started
i
have
heard
that
he
had
relatives
living
in
a
settlement
south
of
us
but
whether
he
went
to
visit
them
on
his
journeys
or
spent
the
money
he
earned
in
in
walking
about
for
his
health
paying
for
his
entertainment
night
overtook
him
i
did
not
know
then
nor
do
i
know
now
once
in
a
long
while
he
came
to
our
house
always
when
my
father
was
away
and
after
watching
my
mother
awhile
as
she
went
about
her
work
went
away
again
sometimes
without
saying
a
word
although
she
always
talked
kindly
to
him
and
was
glad
to
see
him
occasionally
he
would
accept
her
invitation
to
refresh
himself
with
food
but
not
often
and
when
he
did
he
would
be
offended
unless
she
took
a
present
of
money
to
buy
something
to
remember
him
by
if
she
was
dangerously
ill
which
was
often
the
case
for
she
was
never
strong
he
was
never
sent
for
nobody
thought
of
him
as
of
any
use
or
as
caring
much
about
it
but
when
she
had
recovered
he
would
come
over
and
after
looking
at
her
curiously
return
home
satisfied
i
think
that
had
she
died
he
would
not
have
been
invited
to
the
funeral
but
i
am
certain
that
after
it
was
all
over
he
would
often
have
visited
her
grave
and
looked
at
it
in
quiet
astonishment
on
returning
from
her
visits
to
the
sick
my
grandmother
usually
stopped
at
our
house
and
sometimes
i
was
lifted
up
behind
to
go
home
with
her
to
take
care
of
the
horse
she
rode
for
my
grandfather
disliked
horses
arriving
at
the
house
of
hewn
logs
in
the
edge
of
the
woods
she
dismounted
and
went
in
and
i
went
on
to
the
stables
returning
after
i
had
finished
my
work
i
found
my
grandfather
on
one
side
of
the
and
my
grandmother
on
the
other
looking
into
the
fire
or
if
it
was
summer
into
the
cavernous
recess
where
the
backlog
would
have
been
blazing
in
winter
if
it
was
evening
which
was
usually
the
case
i
was
soon
sent
out
to
make
the
fire
for
the
evening
meal
but
after
this
was
eaten
we
resumed
our
places
at
the
hearth
sometimes
i
told
them
what
i
knew
was
going
on
in
the
neighborhood
and
caused
them
to
ask
questions
and
replied
to
them
and
tried
to
lure
them
into
a
conversation
but
i
never
succeeded
if
my
grandmother
told
me
that
one
of
her
patients
had
died
the
information
was
really
intended
for
her
husband
and
if
he
did
not
fully
understand
it
he
directed
his
questions
to
me
and
she
replied
in
the
same
way
in
this
way
they
also
discussed
household
affairs
of
which
it
was
necessary
for
each
to
know
storing
them
up
until
i
came
but
never
speaking
directly
to
each
other
after
i
had
sat
between
them
for
an
hour
or
more
it
would
suddenly
occur
to
my
grandmother
that
i
had
been
up
too
long
already
and
after
divesting
me
of
clothing
i
was
thrown
into
the
centre
of
a
great
three
of
which
stood
in
a
row
at
the
back
end
of
the
room
i
was
put
into
the
middle
one
as
if
to
keep
my
as
far
apart
as
possible
again
for
i
was
certain
that
my
grandmother
slept
in
one
and
my
grandfather
in
the
other
the
one
which
i
occupied
was
also
the
company
bed
for
my
grandmother
evidently
desired
me
to
know
that
my
mother
excellent
woman
though
she
was
could
not
hope
to
learn
perfectly
the
art
of
making
up
a
for
many
years
yet
if
i
raised
my
head
quietly
and
looked
out
i
found
the
strange
couple
sitting
by
the
fire
as
i
had
left
them
and
in
wondering
whether
they
would
remain
there
all
night
i
fell
asleep
when
i
awoke
in
the
morning
they
were
up
before
me
waiting
for
daylight
as
people
were
early
risers
in
those
days
and
i
never
knew
certainly
that
they
went
to
bed
at
all
but
always
wondered
whether
they
did
not
sit
beside
the
fire
throughout
the
long
night
after
a
while
my
grandmother
came
to
the
bed
pulled
me
out
and
into
my
clothes
and
sent
me
to
the
spring
to
wash
my
face
for
breakfast
which
was
soon
thereafter
ready
when
this
was
over
i
was
started
for
home
usually
carrying
a
present
of
butter
or
eggs
for
my
mother
and
a
box
on
the
ears
for
myself
chapter
iv
the
religion
of
fairview
although
the
people
of
fairview
frequently
did
not
dress
comfortably
and
lived
in
the
plainest
manner
they
never
failed
to
attend
the
services
at
the
church
to
which
everybody
belonged
with
the
exception
of
my
grandfather
and
jo
and
myself
i
have
often
wondered
since
that
we
were
not
made
the
subject
of
a
special
series
of
meetings
and
frightened
into
repentance
but
for
some
unaccountable
reason
we
were
left
alone
they
even
discussed
jo
s
situation
laying
it
to
contrariness
and
saying
that
if
all
the
rest
of
them
were
wicked
he
would
be
religious
but
they
said
nothing
at
all
to
me
about
the
subject
i
often
attended
the
revivals
and
sang
the
songs
as
loudly
as
the
rest
of
them
but
when
i
thought
that
i
was
one
of
those
whose
terrible
condition
the
hymns
described
it
gave
me
such
a
turn
that
i
left
that
part
of
the
house
where
the
excitement
ran
highest
and
joined
jo
on
the
back
seats
who
took
no
other
interest
in
the
novel
performance
than
that
of
as
soon
as
a
sufficient
number
of
children
reached
a
suitable
age
to
make
their
conversion
a
harvest
a
revival
was
commenced
for
their
benefit
and
they
were
called
upon
to
make
a
full
confession
with
such
energy
and
warned
to
cling
to
the
cross
for
safety
with
such
earnestness
that
they
generally
did
it
and
but
few
escaped
if
there
was
one
so
stubborn
that
he
would
not
yield
from
worldly
pride
of
which
he
had
not
a
particle
no
one
ever
supposed
it
possible
that
he
lacked
faith
though
they
all
did
the
meetings
were
continued
from
sunday
until
monday
and
kept
up
every
night
of
the
week
at
the
house
where
the
owner
of
the
obdurate
heart
lived
so
that
he
finally
gave
in
for
peace
and
quiet
if
for
nothing
else
if
two
or
three
or
four
or
five
would
not
relent
within
a
reasonable
time
the
people
gave
up
every
other
work
and
gathered
at
the
church
in
great
alarm
in
response
to
the
ringing
of
the
bell
and
there
they
prayed
and
shouted
the
livelong
day
for
the
lord
to
come
down
among
them
at
these
times
jo
and
i
were
usually
left
at
home
to
work
in
the
field
and
if
we
heard
the
people
coming
home
in
the
evening
shouting
and
singing
we
knew
that
the
lost
sheep
had
been
recovered
and
i
often
feared
they
would
form
a
ring
around
us
in
the
field
and
compel
a
full
surrender
a
young
woman
who
lived
at
our
house
to
help
my
mother
the
daughter
of
a
neighboring
farmer
once
engaged
their
attention
for
nearly
a
week
but
she
gave
up
one
hot
afternoon
and
came
down
the
path
which
led
through
the
cornfields
from
the
church
shouting
and
going
on
like
mad
followed
by
those
that
had
been
present
when
the
lord
finally
came
down
who
were
singing
and
proclaiming
the
event
as
loudly
as
they
could
this
frightened
me
so
much
that
i
ran
into
the
house
and
hid
under
the
bed
supposing
they
would
soon
go
away
and
that
then
i
could
come
out
but
they
immediately
began
a
to
give
the
new
convert
opportunity
to
face
a
frowning
world
by
relating
her
experience
and
thus
they
kept
me
in
my
uncomfortable
position
until
i
thought
i
must
smother
from
the
heat
my
father
received
little
aid
in
the
conduct
of
these
meetings
except
from
a
very
good
farmer
but
very
bad
exhorter
named
theodore
meek
whose
name
had
been
gradually
shortened
by
neighborhood
familiarity
until
he
was
known
as
the
meek
and
for
a
long
time
i
thought
he
was
meant
when
reference
was
made
to
the
meek
and
lowly
supposing
that
lowly
was
an
equally
good
man
living
in
some
of
the
adjoining
settlements
this
remarkable
man
laughed
his
religion
rather
than
preached
or
prayed
or
shouted
or
sang
it
his
singing
would
be
regarded
at
this
day
as
a
very
expert
rendering
of
a
laughing
song
but
to
us
it
was
an
impressive
performance
as
were
his
praying
and
occasional
preaching
though
i
wonder
we
were
not
amused
the
meek
was
after
my
father
the
next
best
man
in
fairview
the
next
largest
farmer
and
the
next
in
religion
and
thrift
in
moving
to
the
country
i
think
his
wagons
were
next
to
ours
which
headed
the
procession
he
sat
nearest
the
pulpit
at
the
meetings
was
the
second
to
arrive
my
father
coming
first
and
always
took
up
the
collections
if
there
was
a
funeral
he
stood
next
my
father
who
conducted
the
services
at
the
he
was
the
second
to
speak
and
if
a
widow
needed
her
corn
gathered
or
her
winter
s
wood
chopped
my
father
suggested
it
and
the
meek
immediately
said
it
should
have
been
attended
to
before
he
also
lived
nearer
our
house
than
any
of
the
others
and
was
oftener
there
and
his
house
was
built
so
much
like
ours
that
only
experts
knew
it
was
cheaper
and
not
quite
so
large
his
family
which
consisted
of
a
fat
wife
by
a
second
marriage
and
so
many
children
that
i
never
could
remember
all
their
names
there
was
always
a
new
baby
whenever
its
immediate
predecessor
was
old
enough
to
name
were
laughers
like
him
and
to
a
stranger
it
would
have
seemed
that
they
found
jokes
in
the
bible
for
they
were
always
reading
the
bible
and
always
laughing
another
assistant
was
tremaine
the
miller
s
widowed
sister
who
had
lived
in
the
country
before
we
came
a
woman
who
apparently
had
no
other
duty
to
attend
to
than
religion
for
although
she
lived
a
considerable
distance
from
fairview
church
she
was
always
at
the
meetings
and
i
have
thought
of
her
as
being
constantly
occupied
in
coming
from
or
going
to
church
finding
it
time
to
start
back
again
as
soon
as
she
reached
home
the
only
assistance
she
afforded
was
to
pray
whenever
called
upon
in
a
voice
so
low
that
there
was
always
doubt
when
she
had
finished
but
this
made
little
difference
as
it
gave
the
others
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
short
exclamations
concerning
the
kindness
of
the
lord
if
sinners
would
really
renounce
the
world
and
make
a
full
confession
her
speeches
in
the
experience
meetings
were
of
the
same
order
and
when
she
sat
down
the
congregation
invariably
began
a
song
descriptive
of
a
noble
woman
always
battling
for
the
right
and
sure
to
conquer
in
the
end
from
which
grew
an
impression
that
she
was
a
very
sainted
person
and
that
the
sins
of
her
brother
the
miller
were
much
on
her
mind
it
is
certain
that
he
thought
little
of
them
himself
never
attending
the
services
or
sending
his
regrets
it
was
usually
a
part
of
my
duty
on
sunday
to
take
one
of
the
wagons
jo
taking
the
other
and
to
drive
about
collecting
infirm
and
unfortunate
people
who
would
otherwise
be
unable
to
attend
church
for
my
father
believed
in
salvation
for
all
who
were
willing
to
accept
it
though
they
were
poor
and
unable
to
walk
or
hear
or
see
or
understand
and
he
was
kinder
to
the
unfortunate
people
than
to
any
of
the
others
favoring
them
out
of
his
strength
and
abundance
in
a
hundred
ways
there
was
always
a
suspicion
in
my
mind
which
may
have
been
an
unjust
one
that
they
shouted
and
went
on
in
response
to
his
preaching
because
he
was
their
friend
and
wanted
them
to
do
so
in
any
event
he
could
throw
them
into
the
greatest
excitement
and
cause
them
to
exhibit
themselves
in
the
most
remarkable
way
whenever
he
saw
fit
so
that
they
got
on
very
well
together
one
of
these
unfortunates
was
winter
the
lame
shoemaker
who
wheeled
himself
around
in
a
low
buggy
pushing
this
into
my
wagon
with
the
assistance
of
his
wife
after
we
had
first
made
a
of
boards
i
hauled
him
to
fairview
where
we
unloaded
him
in
the
same
manner
he
was
a
very
devout
man
and
a
shouter
and
during
the
revivals
he
wheeled
himself
up
and
down
the
aisles
in
his
buggy
which
frequently
squeaked
and
rattled
in
a
very
uncomfortable
manner
to
shake
hands
with
the
people
i
suppose
that
at
first
this
performance
was
a
little
odd
to
people
but
they
got
used
to
it
for
i
have
noticed
that
while
strangers
regarded
winter
as
a
great
curiosity
he
attracted
no
more
attention
at
home
than
a
man
unobjectionable
in
the
matter
of
legs
there
was
a
good
deal
of
talk
from
time
to
time
of
holding
special
services
to
restore
winter
s
shrivelled
legs
by
prayer
but
if
ever
it
was
tried
it
was
in
secret
for
i
never
heard
of
it
there
were
probably
half
a
dozen
of
these
unfortunates
altogether
and
they
were
always
given
the
best
corner
which
was
near
the
pulpit
where
their
piety
could
be
easily
seen
and
heard
with
the
addition
of
a
blind
woman
who
cried
and
lamented
a
great
deal
and
whom
i
also
went
after
nearly
every
sunday
those
i
have
mentioned
were
the
ones
most
conspicuous
in
the
meetings
for
while
the
others
were
very
devout
they
had
nothing
to
offer
for
the
general
good
except
their
presence
and
a
capacity
to
rise
to
their
feet
and
confess
the
lord
in
a
few
words
my
father
was
the
leader
of
course
and
occupied
the
time
himself
when
others
could
not
be
induced
to
occupy
it
which
was
often
the
case
after
those
i
have
mentioned
had
appeared
in
what
might
be
called
their
specialties
this
coupled
with
the
unforgiving
doctrines
of
rev
john
westlock
was
the
religion
to
which
i
was
accustomed
and
which
i
believe
added
greatly
to
the
other
miseries
of
fairview
for
fairview
was
afflicted
with
a
melancholy
that
could
have
resulted
from
nothing
else
there
was
little
visiting
and
there
were
no
public
gatherings
except
those
at
the
church
already
mentioned
where
the
business
of
serving
the
lord
was
dispatched
as
soon
as
possible
to
allow
the
people
to
return
home
and
nurse
their
misery
the
people
were
all
overworked
and
i
still
remember
how
the
pale
unhappy
women
spoke
in
low
and
trembling
tones
at
the
experience
meetings
of
heavy
crosses
to
bear
and
sat
down
crying
as
though
their
hearts
were
breaking
i
was
always
touched
by
this
pitiful
proceeding
and
i
doubt
not
their
petitions
went
further
into
heaven
than
any
of
the
others
chapter
the
school
in
the
church
when
there
was
nothing
else
for
them
to
do
the
children
of
fairview
were
sent
to
a
school
kept
in
the
church
where
they
studied
around
a
big
box
stove
and
played
at
noon
and
recess
among
the
mounds
in
the
grave
lot
there
being
no
playground
as
it
was
not
intended
that
the
children
of
fairview
should
play
the
older
boys
told
it
in
low
whispers
that
a
sunken
grave
meant
that
the
person
buried
there
had
been
carried
away
by
the
devil
and
it
was
one
of
our
amusements
to
look
among
the
graves
from
day
to
day
to
see
if
the
dreadful
visitor
had
been
around
during
the
preceding
night
these
sunken
graves
were
always
carefully
filled
up
by
relatives
of
the
persons
buried
and
i
regarded
this
as
evidence
that
they
were
anxious
to
hide
the
disgrace
which
had
come
upon
their
families
from
neglect
of
my
father
s
religion
after
a
funeral
which
we
were
all
compelled
to
attend
so
that
we
might
become
practically
impressed
with
the
shortness
of
life
and
where
a
hymn
commencing
hark
from
the
tomb
a
doleful
sound
was
sung
to
such
a
dismal
measure
that
the
very
dogs
howled
to
hear
it
i
used
to
lie
awake
in
speechless
terror
for
a
great
many
nights
fearing
the
devil
would
call
on
me
in
my
room
on
his
way
out
to
the
grave
lot
to
see
whether
the
person
just
buried
belonged
to
him
the
boys
and
girls
who
attended
from
the
houses
dotted
about
on
the
prairie
did
not
differ
from
other
children
except
that
they
were
a
long
time
in
the
first
pages
of
their
books
and
seemed
glad
to
come
i
have
heard
that
in
some
places
measures
are
found
necessary
to
compel
attendance
on
the
schools
but
in
fairview
the
children
regarded
the
teacher
as
their
kindest
and
most
patient
friend
and
the
school
as
a
pleasant
place
of
retreat
where
grumbling
and
complaints
were
never
heard
the
meek
sent
so
many
children
that
the
teacher
never
pretended
to
know
the
exact
number
sometimes
there
were
eleven
and
at
other
times
only
seven
or
eight
for
the
older
ones
seemed
to
take
turns
about
working
one
day
and
studying
the
next
i
think
the
meek
was
about
the
only
man
in
our
country
who
was
as
good
at
home
as
he
was
at
church
and
his
family
of
boys
were
laughers
like
him
and
always
contented
and
happy
they
never
learned
anything
and
my
recollection
is
that
they
all
studied
out
of
one
book
while
i
went
to
school
there
reciting
in
a
class
by
themselves
from
the
same
page
if
the
teacher
came
upon
them
suddenly
in
their
seats
and
asked
them
to
name
the
first
letter
of
the
alphabet
the
chances
were
that
one
of
them
would
know
and
answer
whereupon
they
all
cried
a
in
a
chorus
but
if
one
of
the
number
was
called
out
separately
a
few
moments
later
and
asked
the
same
question
the
round
chubby
face
would
look
up
into
the
teacher
s
and
after
meditating
awhile
moving
his
lips
during
the
time
as
if
recalling
the
rules
governing
such
a
difficult
problem
would
honestly
answer
that
he
didn
t
know
he
was
then
sent
back
to
study
with
the
warning
that
he
would
be
called
out
again
presently
and
asked
to
name
not
only
the
first
letter
but
the
second
and
third
and
perhaps
the
fourth
going
back
to
his
seat
the
brothers
gathered
about
him
and
engaged
in
deep
contemplation
of
their
book
for
awhile
but
one
by
one
their
eyes
wandered
away
from
it
again
and
they
became
the
prey
of
anyone
who
had
it
in
his
heart
to
get
them
into
difficulty
by
setting
them
to
laughing
if
they
all
mastered
the
first
three
letters
that
day
they
were
content
and
were
so
pleased
with
their
progress
that
they
forgot
them
the
next
it
was
always
safe
to
go
to
their
house
and
expect
a
warm
welcome
for
there
seemed
enough
love
hid
away
somewhere
in
the
big
house
in
which
they
lived
not
only
for
all
the
boys
with
a
reserve
stock
for
those
yet
to
come
but
also
for
the
friends
who
came
to
see
them
their
mother
a
large
woman
who
was
noted
for
a
capacity
to
lead
in
prayers
and
blessings
when
her
husband
was
away
was
too
it
was
the
happiest
family
i
had
ever
known
for
though
they
were
all
beset
with
difficulties
every
one
of
them
having
either
weak
eyes
or
the
they
seemed
not
to
mind
it
but
patiently
applied
sulphur
for
one
and
mullein
tea
for
the
other
remedies
which
were
kept
in
saucers
and
bottles
all
over
the
house
i
never
heard
the
meek
or
his
wife
speak
impatiently
to
any
of
their
children
but
they
were
obedient
for
all
that
much
more
so
than
those
of
us
who
were
beaten
on
the
slightest
provocation
and
were
very
fond
of
one
another
while
other
boys
were
anxious
to
get
away
from
home
the
meek
s
children
were
content
and
believed
there
was
not
another
so
pleasant
place
in
the
world
as
the
big
house
built
after
the
architecture
of
a
in
which
they
lived
i
often
thought
of
this
circumstance
to
their
credit
and
thought
it
was
also
to
the
credit
of
the
father
and
the
mother
there
were
but
three
rooms
in
the
house
two
down
stairs
and
one
above
as
large
as
both
of
those
below
in
which
all
the
boys
slept
and
here
also
were
the
company
beds
so
that
had
i
ever
heard
of
an
asylum
at
the
time
of
which
i
write
i
should
certainly
have
thought
the
big
room
with
the
nine
or
ten
beds
scattered
about
in
it
was
like
one
i
frequently
went
from
school
to
spend
the
night
with
the
young
meeks
and
after
we
had
gone
to
bed
in
the
big
room
upstairs
i
either
froze
their
blood
with
ghost
stories
or
convulsed
them
by
telling
any
foolish
event
i
happened
to
think
of
at
which
they
laughed
until
i
feared
for
their
lives
if
the
uproar
became
particularly
loud
their
father
and
mother
came
up
to
see
what
it
was
all
about
and
on
being
informed
of
the
cause
laughed
themselves
and
went
down
again
the
two
sons
of
the
crippled
but
devout
shoemaker
winter
were
the
most
remarkable
scholars
that
attended
the
school
for
the
reason
that
they
seemed
to
have
mastered
all
sorts
of
depravity
by
sheer
force
of
native
genius
for
though
they
possessed
all
the
accomplishments
of
street
arabs
and
we
thought
they
must
surely
be
town
boys
the
truth
was
that
they
were
seldom
allowed
even
to
go
to
town
and
therefore
could
not
have
contracted
the
vices
of
civilization
from
the
contagion
of
evil
society
when
one
of
them
did
go
he
returned
with
a
knife
for
nearly
every
boy
in
the
school
and
cloves
and
cinnamon
bark
to
last
for
weeks
which
were
stolen
from
the
stores
if
one
of
us
longed
for
anything
in
their
presence
they
said
it
would
be
forthcoming
immediately
if
we
got
them
opportunity
to
go
to
town
this
was
only
possible
by
inducing
some
one
to
allow
them
to
drive
a
team
as
their
father
was
poor
and
did
not
keep
horses
the
older
and
i
may
add
the
worse
one
was
probably
named
hardy
but
he
was
always
known
as
hard
winter
because
of
his
hard
character
and
his
brother
s
evil
reputation
was
so
woven
into
his
name
that
we
never
knew
what
the
latter
really
was
for
he
was
known
as
beef
hide
winter
a
rebuke
i
believe
for
his
failure
to
get
away
with
a
hide
he
had
once
stolen
but
the
boys
accepted
these
titles
with
great
cheerfulness
and
did
not
mind
them
they
were
the
mildest
mannered
villains
i
have
no
doubt
that
ever
lived
for
no
difference
how
convincing
the
proof
was
against
them
they
still
denied
it
with
tears
in
their
eyes
and
were
always
trying
to
convince
those
around
them
by
kindness
and
civility
that
they
were
not
so
bad
as
represented
though
they
were
worse
and
i
fear
they
were
rather
popular
in
spite
of
their
weakness
for
things
not
belonging
to
them
in
course
of
time
their
petty
peculations
came
to
be
regarded
in
about
the
same
light
as
was
their
father
s
shouting
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
the
neighborhood
and
we
paid
them
no
other
attention
than
to
watch
them
at
the
fourth
of
july
celebrations
in
the
woods
where
all
sorts
of
persons
came
to
set
up
business
the
winter
boys
stole
a
little
of
everything
they
saw
on
exhibition
and
generously
divided
with
their
friends
if
they
were
sent
together
to
a
house
near
the
school
after
water
one
went
through
the
cellar
while
the
other
went
to
the
well
and
if
he
secured
anything
he
made
a
division
at
the
first
opportunity
they
always
had
their
pockets
full
of
things
to
give
away
and
i
am
satisfied
that
they
came
by
none
of
them
honestly
for
they
were
very
poor
and
at
home
but
seldom
had
enough
even
to
eat
a
habit
of
theirs
was
to
throw
stones
with
great
accuracy
a
collection
of
which
they
carried
around
in
their
pockets
ready
for
use
making
long
journeys
to
the
creek
bottoms
to
select
them
they
always
went
home
with
or
geese
in
their
possession
which
they
said
had
been
given
to
them
but
which
they
had
really
knocked
over
in
the
road
near
farmers
houses
they
could
kill
more
squirrels
and
quails
by
throwing
than
others
of
a
similar
age
could
by
shooting
and
it
will
be
imagined
that
their
failings
were
but
seldom
mentioned
for
they
were
dangerous
adversaries
though
usually
peaceable
enough
the
teacher
of
this
school
at
the
time
of
which
i
now
write
to
be
more
explicit
when
i
was
eleven
years
old
for
what
i
have
already
written
is
a
hurried
retrospect
covering
a
period
of
six
years
was
a
very
young
and
pretty
girl
named
agnes
deming
certainly
not
over
sixteen
and
i
doubt
if
that
who
came
from
a
neighborhood
north
of
fairview
where
her
widowed
mother
lived
with
an
eccentric
brother
and
although
it
was
as
poor
as
ours
she
spoke
of
it
in
such
a
way
not
boastingly
but
tenderly
and
reverently
that
we
thought
of
the
community
of
smoky
hill
as
a
very
superior
one
her
father
of
whom
she
talked
a
great
deal
had
been
captain
of
a
sailing
vessel
as
i
learned
a
little
at
a
time
and
before
his
death
they
lived
in
a
town
by
the
sea
where
his
ship
loaded
of
the
town
however
which
was
called
bradford
she
had
but
slight
recollection
for
when
a
very
little
girl
she
was
sent
away
to
school
and
came
home
only
at
long
intervals
to
welcome
her
father
who
was
often
away
a
year
at
a
time
when
ten
years
old
and
after
the
ship
had
been
absent
a
long
time
she
was
sent
for
hurriedly
one
day
and
told
on
her
arrival
that
her
father
s
ship
had
gone
down
at
sea
that
all
on
board
were
lost
and
that
they
were
going
west
to
live
with
her
uncle
an
eccentric
man
whom
she
had
never
seen
after
a
few
months
of
preparation
during
which
time
their
effects
were
converted
into
money
they
commenced
their
journey
to
the
country
in
which
they
had
since
lived
when
she
was
fourteen
years
old
her
uncle
found
her
a
place
to
teach
a
summer
school
and
giving
satisfaction
in
spite
of
her
tender
years
she
had
followed
the
calling
since
her
second
engagement
being
in
our
neighborhood
i
remember
how
generally
it
was
said
on
her
arrival
that
she
would
not
do
as
she
was
very
young
but
before
the
summer
was
over
she
somehow
convinced
her
patrons
that
she
would
do
very
well
as
she
was
thoughtful
and
intelligent
and
competent
in
every
way
this
was
her
brief
history
and
before
she
had
lived
at
fairview
a
year
nobody
was
like
agnes
deming
for
she
was
everybody
s
friend
and
adviser
and
was
kinder
to
the
people
than
anyone
had
ever
been
before
she
was
a
revelation
to
fairview
a
woman
of
a
kind
they
had
never
before
seen
one
who
uttered
no
complaints
but
who
listened
patiently
to
the
complaints
of
others
and
did
what
she
could
to
help
them
whoever
was
in
distress
received
her
sympathy
and
aid
and
i
think
the
advent
of
this
friendless
little
woman
with
her
unselfish
and
pretty
ways
did
more
good
for
fairview
than
its
religion
for
the
people
tried
to
become
like
her
and
were
better
in
every
way
from
the
description
she
gave
i
imagined
her
father
to
have
been
a
bluff
and
manly
fellow
for
i
had
heard
that
such
followed
the
sea
and
when
i
found
her
crying
softly
to
herself
i
thought
of
course
she
was
thinking
of
him
and
often
regretted
that
he
was
not
in
fairview
to
be
proud
of
his
pretty
daughter
instead
of
at
the
bottom
of
the
restless
and
angry
sea
that
they
had
been
very
fond
of
each
other
i
felt
sure
and
when
the
winds
blew
furiously
around
our
house
as
they
often
did
she
seemed
greatly
distressed
as
though
it
was
just
such
a
storm
as
that
in
which
her
father
s
ship
went
down
she
sang
to
us
at
night
sometimes
in
a
sad
sweet
voice
but
always
of
storms
and
of
shipwrecks
as
if
the
frightful
manner
of
her
father
s
death
was
much
on
her
mind
and
as
if
she
sorrowed
always
because
she
could
not
hope
that
some
day
his
ship
would
come
in
and
the
dreadful
story
of
his
death
prove
a
mistake
she
said
almost
nothing
of
her
mother
and
in
reasoning
about
it
i
thought
that
perhaps
deming
was
so
much
distressed
over
the
death
of
her
husband
as
to
be
poor
company
and
anxious
to
be
let
alone
for
agnes
seemed
glad
when
vacation
was
over
and
she
was
again
occupying
her
old
room
in
our
house
although
she
was
originally
expected
to
divide
her
time
equally
with
every
family
sending
children
to
the
school
or
to
board
round
she
was
oftener
at
our
house
than
anywhere
else
and
once
when
she
apologized
in
a
burst
of
tears
for
being
there
so
much
my
mother
kissed
her
tenderly
and
it
was
arranged
immediately
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
all
that
in
future
she
should
be
a
recognized
member
of
our
family
my
mother
was
very
fond
of
her
and
so
was
my
father
though
he
seemed
ashamed
to
be
fond
of
anyone
and
being
the
most
influential
of
the
school
directors
he
saw
that
her
pay
was
good
and
prompt
and
on
bad
days
took
her
to
school
in
a
wagon
when
jo
and
i
were
busy
on
the
farm
agnes
taught
us
at
night
and
was
so
patient
and
encouraged
us
so
much
that
we
learned
more
than
we
should
have
done
at
school
while
we
were
never
at
school
in
summer
by
this
means
we
were
the
head
scholars
in
winter
though
i
am
not
certain
this
was
much
to
our
credit
for
we
had
little
opposition
from
the
children
of
fairview
i
have
never
seen
a
and
have
no
knowledge
of
them
except
that
they
are
very
beautiful
but
if
their
manners
are
as
graceful
as
their
plumage
is
beautiful
and
it
is
conceded
that
we
of
fairview
were
as
ungainly
and
ugly
as
crows
i
hope
the
impression
made
by
the
coming
of
agnes
deming
to
the
settlement
will
be
understood
i
am
glad
to
be
able
to
write
it
to
the
credit
of
the
people
that
they
were
not
envious
of
her
unless
it
be
envious
in
one
person
to
strive
to
be
like
another
he
admires
and
they
all
loved
her
from
the
day
she
came
until
the
day
she
went
away
although
slight
in
figure
she
was
the
picture
of
health
of
which
she
was
as
careful
as
of
her
dress
and
manners
which
were
never
anything
but
mild
and
gentle
as
man
and
boy
i
have
honestly
admired
a
great
many
women
who
afterwards
shocked
my
admiration
by
a
careless
habit
or
manner
when
they
did
not
know
i
was
about
but
agnes
deming
was
always
the
same
perfect
woman
my
admiration
for
her
never
had
a
check
and
every
day
i
found
in
her
a
new
quality
to
respect
as
did
everyone
who
came
in
contact
with
her
although
i
was
a
favorite
with
her
i
believed
that
when
she
came
into
the
fortune
and
position
she
deserved
i
was
always
expecting
some
such
remarkable
thing
as
this
to
happen
although
i
was
not
certain
just
what
it
would
be
i
was
sure
she
would
not
speak
to
me
or
any
of
those
she
had
known
at
fairview
with
whom
she
had
associated
temporarily
and
made
herself
agreeable
because
that
was
her
disposition
but
that
she
would
hurry
away
as
soon
as
possible
to
get
rid
of
thoughts
of
how
uncomfortable
and
unhappy
she
had
been
among
us
i
do
not
think
i
should
have
blamed
her
for
i
regarded
her
superiority
as
such
that
i
should
have
been
content
to
see
her
go
away
to
enjoy
proud
station
and
rich
friends
thankful
that
she
had
lived
with
us
at
all
and
made
us
happier
than
we
had
been
i
am
certain
that
her
dress
was
inexpensive
and
that
she
spent
little
of
her
money
in
this
way
for
most
of
it
was
sent
to
her
family
but
her
taste
and
skill
were
such
that
she
was
always
neatly
and
becomingly
attired
much
more
so
than
many
i
knew
who
spent
a
great
deal
for
that
time
to
attain
that
end
and
she
was
able
to
work
over
an
old
garment
on
saturday
and
appear
on
sunday
the
woman
in
the
country
i
have
thought
that
she
was
familiar
with
all
the
fashions
in
woman
s
dress
without
ever
having
seen
them
for
she
was
always
in
advance
of
the
plates
in
the
lady
s
book
taken
by
my
mother
with
more
fortunate
surroundings
she
would
have
been
a
remarkable
woman
but
while
there
were
many
others
less
good
and
pretty
who
were
better
off
and
while
she
may
have
had
at
one
time
bright
hopes
for
the
future
her
good
sense
taught
her
that
there
was
really
no
reason
why
she
should
expect
anything
better
now
so
she
diligently
performed
her
work
and
gave
up
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
she
was
simply
mistress
of
the
fairview
school
and
mistress
of
all
our
hearts
and
did
what
good
was
possible
without
vain
regret
for
that
which
might
have
come
to
pass
but
did
not
in
my
recollections
of
that
time
there
is
nothing
pleasant
except
the
sweet
and
patient
face
of
agnes
and
the
memory
of
jo
who
were
always
my
friends
and
who
protected
me
when
i
did
not
deserve
it

loved

in
spite
of
all
my
faults
chapter
vi
damon
barker
barker
s
mill
visits
to
which
had
convinced
jo
that
he
should
like
to
be
a
miller
was
built
on
bull
river
in
the
centre
of
the
only
woods
in
all
that
country
it
was
said
of
its
proprietor
that
he
came
to
the
country
a
great
many
years
before
with
a
train
of
wagons
drawn
by
oxen
on
which
was
loaded
the
machinery
of
what
afterwards
became
the
mill
together
with
his
general
effects
nobody
seemed
to
know
where
he
came
from
but
nobody
seemed
to
care
strangely
enough
for
he
was
trusty
as
a
miller
and
honorable
as
a
citizen
occasionally
he
came
to
our
neighborhood
dressed
in
an
coat
with
brass
buttons
and
vest
and
pantaloons
of
an
equally
aristocratic
pattern
but
i
never
heard
of
his
going
to
the
country
town
if
he
had
money
to
pay
there
or
other
important
business
he
entrusted
it
to
some
one
to
transact
for
him
preferring
to
have
it
half
done
rather
than
to
go
himself
from
this
circumstance
i
came
to
believe
that
damon
barker
had
been
an
outlaw
in
his
time
and
was
anxious
to
avoid
people
although
he
was
very
and
the
only
polished
man
i
had
ever
known
he
came
to
our
house
originally
i
believe
on
some
sort
of
business
and
becoming
acquainted
happened
in
at
long
intervals
afterwards
but
i
never
knew
that
he
went
anywhere
else
we
all
admired
him
for
he
was
a
man
to
make
himself
welcome
anywhere
and
he
sat
quietly
among
us
when
he
came
which
was
always
at
night
as
though
for
private
reasons
he
did
not
walk
out
during
the
day
and
listened
to
what
was
being
said
my
father
had
the
greatest
respect
for
him
and
was
often
uneasy
under
his
steady
gaze
as
if
he
felt
that
damon
barker
was
not
a
fairview
man
and
had
knowledge
and
opinions
of
his
own
they
frequently
discussed
all
sorts
of
questions
or
rather
my
father
discussed
them
in
barker
s
presence
who
only
made
short
answers
indicating
that
he
was
familiar
with
the
subject
in
hand
and
i
was
forced
to
the
belief
that
had
he
seen
fit
he
could
have
readily
torn
to
pieces
many
of
the
arguments
advanced
his
knowledge
of
religious
topics
was
extensive
but
he
patronized
the
subject
as
he
would
patronize
a
child
dismissing
it
with
a
polite
word
as
though
it
was
of
no
consequence
and
we
wondered
that
a
man
who
understood
the
subject
so
well
could
be
indifferent
for
it
was
well
known
that
he
was
not
religious
my
father
often
threatened
to
speak
to
him
about
it
but
he
never
did
either
fearing
that
barker
might
be
able
to
defend
his
position
or
respecting
his
disposition
to
avoid
the
subject
although
he
was
courteous
and
lifting
his
hat
and
bowing
to
my
mother
in
the
most
courtly
manner
when
he
came
and
went
it
was
never
remarked
to
his
discredit
although
a
man
of
his
manners
had
never
been
seen
by
us
before
had
he
been
the
least
awkward
in
his
politeness
i
am
sure
we
should
have
laughed
at
him
and
regarded
him
as
a
fop
for
we
watched
him
narrowly
but
his
adieus
and
greetings
were
so
appropriate
natural
and
easy
that
we
received
them
as
a
matter
of
course
and
accepted
them
as
evidences
not
merely
of
different
but
of
better
breeding
than
we
were
accustomed
to
during
one
of
his
visits
to
the
house
he
invited
jo
and
me
to
the
mill
asking
it
as
a
favor
and
thus
it
came
about
that
occasionally
we
went
to
see
him
on
saturday
afternoons
returning
the
next
day
indeed
we
were
rather
encouraged
to
go
to
barker
s
my
father
believing
that
familiarity
with
such
a
courtly
gentleman
would
do
us
no
harm
if
no
good
and
he
was
not
greatly
displeased
if
we
did
not
return
until
late
sunday
evening
although
he
always
inquired
what
we
found
so
entertaining
at
his
house
and
on
our
replying
he
found
no
objection
to
it
the
house
in
which
barker
lived
was
built
close
to
the
mill
in
a
dense
growth
of
trees
but
as
if
the
shadow
of
these
was
not
sufficient
to
hide
him
he
had
planted
other
trees
among
them
until
the
place
was
so
dark
that
the
sunlight
seldom
found
its
way
in
at
his
windows
the
house
was
very
large
and
strong
with
doors
of
heavy
hard
wood
and
i
thought
that
if
barker
should
be
attacked
he
would
make
a
long
defence
for
he
always
had
provisions
and
fuel
stored
away
in
great
quantities
and
there
was
a
well
in
the
cellar
which
i
always
disliked
to
drink
out
of
fearing
there
might
be
dead
men
in
it
there
were
thick
wooden
blinds
at
all
the
windows
which
were
usually
closed
and
heavy
iron
bars
across
the
doors
and
altogether
the
place
was
so
mysterious
and
unusual
that
it
occurred
to
me
when
i
first
went
there
that
if
either
jo
or
i
should
discover
some
of
its
secrets
by
accident
we
should
be
cut
into
halves
and
thrown
down
the
well
for
fear
we
should
disclose
what
we
had
seen
in
his
own
room
a
large
apartment
occupying
the
greater
part
of
the
second
story
were
strange
and
curious
things
we
had
never
seen
before
and
these
we
were
free
to
examine
and
question
him
about
besides
brass
pistols
hid
away
in
every
box
and
drawer
there
were
swords
and
knives
of
odd
pattern
and
handsome
dresses
for
women
and
men
many
of
them
ornamented
with
gold
lace
and
all
of
a
style
we
had
never
seen
worn
in
a
place
for
plunder
which
adjoined
his
room
were
kept
half
a
dozen
large
chests
and
in
looking
through
them
when
he
gave
me
permission
i
half
expected
to
find
bones
of
dead
men
but
i
found
nothing
except
strange
instruments
scientific
apparatus
maps
drawings
i
had
no
knowledge
of
curiosities
gathered
during
a
long
life
and
the
odd
clothing
i
have
mentioned
if
i
found
something
more
curious
than
the
rest
i
took
it
to
him
as
he
sat
grave
and
silent
in
his
own
room
and
he
told
me
its
history
what
use
it
could
be
put
to
and
where
it
came
from
there
were
a
great
many
books
the
titles
of
which
i
could
not
pronounce
with
all
my
learning
and
these
gave
evidence
of
being
often
used
for
they
were
collected
on
a
turning
shelf
within
easy
reach
of
the
table
at
which
he
usually
sat
if
we
found
a
curious
stone
or
leaf
he
could
tell
its
nature
and
kind
and
if
we
asked
of
something
we
read
in
his
books
he
told
us
about
it
in
a
quiet
simple
way
making
it
quite
easy
of
comprehension
knowing
our
ignorance
he
took
pains
to
answer
the
questions
with
which
we
plied
him
and
we
often
sat
on
either
side
of
him
until
far
into
the
night
listening
to
his
explanations
of
matters
we
were
curious
about
sometimes
going
to
sleep
in
our
chairs
before
he
knew
jo
and
me
he
had
no
friends
he
told
me
this
himself
early
in
our
acquaintance
but
we
amused
him
and
he
became
our
companion
in
everything
we
did
while
at
the
house
or
mill
instructing
and
benefiting
us
in
a
hundred
ways
when
i
say
he
became
our
companion
in
everything
we
did
i
mean
no
more
than
that
he
was
always
with
us
looking
on
when
we
played
the
games
at
cards
he
taught
us
accompanying
us
when
we
walked
through
the
woods
or
rowed
on
the
river
and
giving
suggestions
and
help
in
everything
he
said
but
little
at
any
time
except
in
answer
to
our
questions
and
i
think
his
principal
enjoyment
in
our
companionship
was
to
listen
quietly
to
what
we
had
stored
up
to
tell
him
on
our
different
visits
he
was
regarded
as
hard
and
exacting
by
those
with
whom
he
had
business
dealings
he
dealt
in
nothing
else
but
was
always
kind
and
liberal
with
jo
and
me
giving
us
money
frequently
and
presents
when
he
could
get
them
if
we
were
in
the
mill
with
him
the
entrance
of
a
customer
would
harden
his
features
until
we
were
afraid
of
him
and
we
went
away
until
the
customer
had
gone
when
he
soon
became
himself
again
so
that
we
grew
to
be
afraid
of
him
except
when
we
were
alone
in
barker
s
room
was
a
great
in
which
we
made
wonderful
fires
in
winter
and
the
fire
in
it
seemed
never
to
go
out
so
that
i
have
thought
in
summer
that
if
the
ashes
were
stirred
live
coals
could
be
found
at
the
bottom
around
this
we
always
sat
with
him
during
the
winter
nights
and
we
had
opportunity
to
visit
him
oftener
in
winter
than
at
any
other
time
for
during
that
season
we
had
the
least
to
do
and
did
whatever
barker
thought
would
best
amuse
us
sometimes
he
gave
us
suppers
prepared
by
his
own
hands
from
cans
and
bottles
stored
away
in
other
chests
we
had
not
yet
examined
at
other
times
he
told
us
the
story
of
one
of
the
brass
pistols
or
of
the
strange
we
had
seen
holding
the
article
in
his
hand
to
illustrate
or
if
we
found
something
belonging
to
a
ship
he
told
us
of
the
sea
of
storms
of
strange
countries
and
of
wrecks
in
all
the
stories
of
robbers
and
pirates
that
he
told
us
and
there
were
many
of
that
kind
because
we
preferred
them
i
always
thought
of
him
as
one
of
the
participants
and
was
pleased
when
the
one
i
had
picked
out
for
barker
freed
the
captive
maiden
flinging
back
his
companions
who
would
murder
her
with
the
declaration
that
he
would
have
their
lives
if
they
persisted
thereupon
conducting
her
within
sight
of
her
home
and
having
first
bidden
her
a
gallant
adieu
galloped
away
these
recitals
had
much
of
dashing
romance
in
them
and
his
robberies
were
committed
generally
from
motives
of
daring
rather
than
gain
it
was
always
the
mean
and
stingy
misers
who
were
robbed
and
if
a
beautiful
maiden
was
captured
at
sea
she
was
always
taken
to
her
friends
unless
she
freely
consented
to
marry
the
pirate
captain
which
was
sometimes
the
case
this
kind
of
amusement
he
kept
up
at
night
until
we
became
sleepy
and
lighting
us
to
the
room
in
which
we
were
to
sleep
he
sat
down
on
the
bed
if
we
desired
it
and
continued
the
story
until
we
were
asleep
when
he
returned
to
his
own
apartment
it
seemed
to
me
he
dreaded
the
hour
when
we
would
go
to
sleep
and
leave
him
alone
and
once
when
i
awoke
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
crept
to
his
door
i
found
him
sitting
over
the
table
with
his
hat
and
coat
on
as
if
ready
to
run
away
barker
s
widowed
sister
the
tremaine
already
mentioned
whose
husband
had
been
a
drunkard
and
a
doctor
was
his
housekeeper
when
she
was
at
home
which
was
seldom
the
case
i
believe
she
was
originally
called
betts
or
bett
but
this
was
shortened
to
and
by
this
name
she
was
generally
known
it
was
understood
that
tremaine
had
been
unkind
to
her
before
his
death
and
that
their
married
life
had
been
very
miserable
though
i
never
heard
either
barker
or
herself
say
so
but
such
was
generally
thought
to
be
the
case
nevertheless
for
certainly
the
excellent
woman
had
had
trouble
it
was
also
understood
that
he
died
in
drink
probably
from
catching
fire
on
the
inside
and
that
with
his
last
breath
he
referred
to
his
wife
as
a
snake
and
to
his
neighbors
as
devils
this
impression
like
the
other
one
with
reference
to
his
disposition
had
no
foundation
i
ever
heard
of
except
that
his
relict
worried
a
great
deal
about
people
who
were
going
to
ruin
from
drink
we
supposed
of
course
that
she
was
prompted
to
this
by
the
memory
of
her
late
husband
as
she
was
prompted
to
insist
on
everybody
s
being
religious
by
the
wickedness
of
her
brother
the
miller
having
no
other
place
to
go
after
her
husband
s
death
she
determined
to
move
west
and
live
with
her
brother
and
had
arrived
at
fairview
a
few
years
before
we
did
although
there
was
not
a
drunkard
in
the
county
she
immediately
began
a
war
on
rum
and
when
i
first
encountered
the
words
delirium
tremens
in
connection
with
drunkenness
i
remember
thinking
i
was
acquainted
with
his
widow
next
to
her
desire
to
save
everybody
from
drunkenness
she
wanted
to
save
everybody
from
sin
and
spent
most
of
her
time
in
discussing
these
two
questions
but
she
had
little
opposition
for
everybody
in
that
country
was
religious
as
well
as
temperate
when
she
became
acquainted
with
the
rev
john
westlock
she
at
once
hailed
him
as
a
man
raised
up
to
do
a
great
work
and
was
always
with
him
in
the
meetings
he
held
in
different
places
nothing
being
thought
of
it
if
he
took
her
with
him
and
brought
her
back
again
together
they
established
a
lodge
of
good
templars
at
fairview
although
the
people
were
all
sober
and
temperate
and
once
a
week
they
met
to
call
upon
the
fallen
brother
to
shun
the
cup
and
to
redeem
the
country
from
debauchery
and
vice
barker
said
they
spent
the
evening
in
opening
and
the
other
half
in
he
also
said
once
that
his
sister
was
very
much
offended
that
my
father
preached
without
pay
for
she
would
have
enjoyed
making
fancy
work
to
the
neglect
of
her
brother
s
house
to
sell
at
fairs
to
pay
the
minister
s
salary
and
that
she
was
a
brilliant
woman
at
festivals
barker
often
criticised
her
half
in
jest
and
half
in
earnest
and
once
when
jo
and
i
were
at
his
house
for
dinner
and
something
had
been
lost
he
remarked
that
if
were
as
familiar
with
her
home
as
she
was
familiar
with
the
number
of
gallons
of
liquor
consumed
annually
or
with
the
acts
of
the
apostles
things
would
be
more
comfortable
i
think
he
disliked
her
because
she
paid
so
much
attention
to
other
people
s
faults
and
so
little
to
her
own
but
he
treated
her
courteously
although
he
appeared
to
avoid
her
and
they
were
not
much
together
frequently
left
home
for
days
at
a
time
compelling
her
patient
brother
to
prepare
his
own
meals
or
do
without
but
he
never
complained
unless
she
chose
to
construe
raillery
into
complaint
at
such
times
she
had
a
way
of
replying
to
his
light
words
with
a
seriousness
that
i
thought
disgusted
him
and
made
him
resolve
never
to
mention
the
matter
again
that
she
was
a
miserable
housekeeper
i
had
frequent
occasion
to
know
and
barker
s
house
always
seemed
like
a
bachelor
s
home
as
there
was
nothing
about
it
to
indicate
that
a
woman
lived
there
jo
used
to
say
of
tremaine
that
she
talked
as
the
women
write
who
furnish
recipes
to
the
newspapers
and
when
she
came
to
our
house
the
room
in
which
she
sat
seemed
damp
for
several
days
thereafter
once
after
she
had
slept
there
and
i
was
put
into
the
bed
she
had
occupied
a
night
or
two
afterward
i
amused
my
mother
by
asking
her
to
change
the
sheets
as
they
seemed
like
ice
and
would
not
thaw
out
and
the
good
humor
with
which
she
did
this
convinced
me
that
she
did
not
like
very
well
herself
her
face
was
large
and
round
and
of
a
waxen
color
and
though
it
was
said
by
some
that
she
was
handsome
i
never
thought
so
nor
did
i
admire
her
dress
which
was
very
rich
and
expensive
though
exceedingly
plain
her
teeth
were
very
white
and
quite
prominent
because
she
always
wore
what
was
intended
to
be
an
enchanting
smile
and
when
she
kissed
me
which
she
usually
did
in
the
earlier
days
of
our
acquaintance
as
a
compliment
to
a
child
i
thought
she
must
have
just
finished
washing
her
face
her
lips
were
so
cold
and
damp
her
hair
being
very
dark
and
her
face
very
pale
i
thought
she
resembled
a
and
affable
corpse
risen
from
the
dead
whose
business
it
was
to
go
among
the
people
and
warn
them
that
unless
they
repented
of
their
sins
they
would
very
much
regret
it
after
death
chapter
vii
a
new
dispensation
in
spite
of
the
discontent
which
prevailed
there
fairview
progressed
with
the
years
of
its
history
the
hard
work
of
the
people
paid
and
they
gradually
became
although
they
seemed
surprised
that
they
were
not
in
the
an
event
they
were
always
promising
their
families
the
old
houses
in
which
they
had
at
first
lived
were
replaced
with
new
ones
the
new
ones
were
furnished
better
than
the
old
ones
had
been
and
there
was
a
general
prosperity
which
surprised
them
for
they
had
not
expected
it
so
soon
if
at
all
new
people
came
to
settle
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
were
neither
invited
nor
expected
and
many
of
those
who
came
first
had
money
ahead
and
were
regarded
by
those
who
came
later
as
of
a
very
old
and
aristocratic
stock
strangest
of
all
it
was
announced
that
a
new
minister
had
been
engaged
and
that
he
would
arrive
with
his
family
consisting
of
a
wife
and
one
child
in
a
few
days
my
father
made
the
announcement
at
the
close
of
his
preaching
one
spring
morning
he
had
preached
to
them
he
said
because
they
were
too
poor
to
pay
a
better
man
the
lord
had
prospered
them
and
he
cheerfully
made
way
for
a
successor
who
had
not
only
religious
enthusiasm
but
extensive
learning
as
well
he
would
continue
to
exhort
his
brethren
whenever
occasion
seemed
to
require
and
aid
in
doing
the
work
of
the
master
but
he
believed
the
good
of
the
church
demanded
the
arrangement
he
had
made
there
was
unusual
feeling
in
his
words
as
he
reviewed
the
hard
struggle
of
the
settlement
and
when
he
had
finished
the
meek
though
apparently
in
greater
convulsions
of
laughter
than
ever
managed
to
say
a
few
kind
words
for
their
pastor
guide
and
friend
and
two
or
three
of
the
other
men
followed
in
a
similar
strain
the
women
began
to
cry
softly
as
though
the
occasion
were
a
funeral
and
one
by
one
the
people
went
forward
to
shake
him
by
the
hand
which
i
thought
surprised
him
not
being
certain
but
that
they
were
glad
to
get
rid
of
him
while
brother
winter
wheeled
vigorously
about
calling
upon
everybody
to
praise
the
lord
it
was
a
very
unusual
occasion
and
those
who
had
lounged
outside
to
read
the
inscriptions
on
the
in
the
grave
lot
came
back
again
to
see
what
it
was
all
about
and
heard
the
news
with
surprise
and
astonishment
finally
the
miller
s
sister
prayed
for
everybody
but
in
a
voice
so
low
that
nobody
knew
it
after
which
the
meeting
broke
up
and
the
congregation
gathered
in
little
knots
in
the
church
and
in
the
yard
to
talk
of
the
new
minister
great
curiosity
was
everywhere
expressed
and
the
curious
naturally
came
to
my
father
for
information
he
knew
nothing
except
that
the
new
minister
had
been
transferred
from
an
eastern
state
at
his
own
request
that
his
name
was
the
rev
goode
shepherd
and
that
he
would
be
there
for
the
next
service
a
week
from
that
day
that
a
house
had
been
secured
for
him
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
settlement
and
that
as
he
was
a
minister
he
was
of
course
a
good
man
and
without
question
of
use
to
the
church
else
the
lord
would
not
permit
him
to
preach
this
was
all
he
knew
or
all
he
cared
to
tell
and
the
people
went
home
to
wonder
and
to
talk
about
it
rev
goode
shepherd
came
west
i
am
of
the
opinion
because
the
east
was
crowded
with
good
men
and
because
he
had
heard
there
was
a
scarcity
of
such
in
our
direction
although
he
had
some
vague
ideas
on
the
subject
of
growing
up
with
the
country
he
probably
consented
to
come
because
somebody
recommended
it
and
not
because
he
was
exactly
clear
himself
how
the
move
was
to
be
of
benefit
had
some
one
in
whose
judgment
he
had
equal
confidence
suggested
after
his
arrival
that
he
had
better
go
back
again
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
would
have
become
convinced
finally
that
the
lord
had
said
it
instead
of
a
friend
and
quietly
returned
to
the
place
from
which
he
had
come
for
he
was
always
uncertain
whether
his
convictions
were
the
result
of
inspiration
or
whether
they
were
the
result
of
the
gossip
he
had
heard
i
had
remarked
of
my
father
s
religion
that
it
was
a
yoke
that
did
not
fit
him
and
which
was
uncomfortable
to
wear
but
the
rev
goode
shepherd
s
religion
was
his
vocation
and
pleasure
and
he
believed
in
it
with
all
the
strength
of
which
he
was
capable
that
he
was
poor
was
evidence
to
him
that
he
was
accepted
of
the
master
who
had
sent
him
rather
than
that
his
life
had
been
a
failure
and
the
work
expected
of
him
he
performed
cheerfully
and
with
enthusiasm
he
had
no
desire
to
do
anything
which
was
not
religious
and
the
higher
walks
of
his
profession
and
heaven
finally
as
his
reward
were
all
he
desired
or
expected
there
was
abundant
scope
in
theology
for
his
ambition
and
far
from
craving
an
active
business
life
he
rather
chose
his
profession
because
it
offered
excuse
for
knowing
so
little
about
the
affairs
of
men
i
have
thought
that
because
he
took
pleasure
in
his
religion
and
loved
it
was
one
reason
why
it
was
not
so
hard
and
unforgiving
as
my
father
s
for
on
this
question
there
was
nothing
in
common
between
them
except
that
both
believed
that
there
is
a
heaven
and
that
it
is
desirable
to
be
saved
the
rev
goode
shepherd
believed
that
learning
and
luxury
could
go
hand
in
hand
with
religion
my
father
that
luxury
was
an
invention
of
the
devil
to
make
men
forget
and
that
learning
could
be
trusted
to
only
a
very
few
because
unless
coupled
with
the
most
pronounced
piety
it
was
very
dangerous
the
rev
goode
shepherd
believed
that
a
religious
life
was
most
easily
lived
and
that
a
merciful
providence
had
ordered
it
that
way
because
the
children
of
men
are
weak
my
father
that
the
easy
road
to
travel
was
the
broad
one
which
led
to
torment
and
that
the
other
was
narrow
and
difficult
but
ending
very
pleasantly
as
a
recompense
for
travelling
it
and
that
it
was
ordered
that
way
so
that
only
the
brave
and
deserving
should
win
the
prize
ridding
the
righteous
of
the
weak
and
the
undeserving
by
burning
them
up
the
rev
goode
shepherd
believed
that
while
walking
the
golden
streets
of
the
heavenly
city
he
would
meet
many
of
the
friends
he
had
worried
about
saved
by
love
infinitely
greater
than
he
expected
my
father
that
he
would
miss
many
faces
in
paradise
he
had
half
expected
to
see
but
who
had
fallen
exhausted
by
the
wayside
and
given
up
the
struggle
the
new
dispensation
did
much
for
fairview
and
its
advancement
after
the
coming
of
shepherd
was
certainly
more
rapid
than
it
had
ever
been
before
i
never
knew
but
it
seems
probable
to
me
now
that
shepherd
was
educated
for
the
ministry
because
he
was
quiet
and
religious
as
a
boy
and
had
always
led
a
blameless
and
exemplary
life
i
think
his
expenses
at
school
were
paid
by
relatives
none
too
well
off
themselves
and
that
he
went
directly
from
college
to
the
pulpit
i
don
t
know
what
made
me
think
it
but
i
always
believed
a
widowed
mother
aided
perhaps
by
an
older
sister
or
two
engaged
in
teaching
had
provided
for
his
education
by
the
closest
economy
that
he
had
always
intended
to
become
famous
to
repay
them
for
their
kindness
but
finding
it
a
harder
task
than
he
had
imagined
that
he
had
in
later
life
settled
down
to
the
conviction
that
to
be
good
is
better
than
to
be
great
when
his
tall
form
and
pale
face
appeared
above
the
pulpit
at
fairview
for
the
first
time
the
impression
was
general
among
the
people
that
he
was
older
than
they
expected
the
one
child
he
had
written
he
was
possessed
of
turned
out
to
be
a
pretty
girl
of
nineteen
or
twenty
who
attracted
a
great
deal
of
attention
as
she
came
in
with
her
mother
and
sat
down
near
the
pulpit
both
sat
throughout
the
service
without
looking
around
perhaps
because
they
thought
it
was
not
likely
they
would
see
much
if
they
should
commit
that
impropriety
his
first
preaching
impressed
everyone
favorably
though
his
side
whiskers
were
against
him
as
was
also
the
tall
hat
standing
on
the
pulpit
beside
him
his
presence
however
chilled
the
usual
experience
meeting
following
for
only
the
men
talked
and
it
was
short
and
dull
the
meek
s
laugh
was
not
heard
at
all
and
brother
winter
sat
quietly
in
his
corner
as
though
undecided
whether
under
the
circumstances
he
would
be
warranted
in
pushing
to
the
front
the
miller
s
sister
had
nothing
to
say
either
spending
her
time
in
watching
the
minister
s
wife
and
daughter
who
did
not
recognize
the
impertinence
and
altogether
the
occasion
was
not
what
was
expected
when
the
meeting
was
dismissed
my
father
stepped
forward
to
welcome
shepherd
to
fairview
after
him
came
the
meek
and
so
one
by
one
the
people
advanced
to
be
introduced
and
after
awkwardly
shaking
him
by
the
hand
retired
again
shepherd
led
my
father
back
to
where
his
respectable
wife
and
pretty
daughter
were
and
performed
the
ceremony
of
introduction
and
i
imagined
as
my
father
looked
at
them
that
he
thought
they
were
birds
of
too
fine
plumage
for
that
clime
and
would
soon
fly
away
again
the
meek
stood
immediately
behind
him
and
was
next
presented
and
then
came
all
the
congregation
in
the
order
of
their
importance
except
the
younger
ones
who
stood
near
the
door
looking
on
and
who
crowded
out
hurriedly
when
shepherd
came
toward
them
followed
by
his
wife
and
daughter
although
they
desired
acquaintance
with
the
new
minister
and
his
family
above
all
other
things
they
were
so
awkward
and
uncertain
in
their
politeness
that
they
hoped
the
new
minister
would
somehow
gradually
become
acquainted
with
them
without
an
introduction
and
never
discover
that
they
did
not
know
how
to
be
comfortable
in
the
presence
of
strangers
jo
erring
was
among
the
number
of
the
intimidated
and
i
thought
he
was
anxious
that
the
new
people
should
not
see
him
until
he
had
gone
home
and
smartened
himself
up
as
if
they
were
of
more
importance
than
he
had
expected
for
he
kept
himself
behind
the
others
jo
had
a
habit
of
appearing
on
sunday
in
his
attire
because
everybody
else
wore
their
best
on
that
day
it
was
said
and
this
was
one
of
the
days
he
violated
the
custom
of
the
country
probably
for
the
reason
that
the
occasion
was
an
extraordinary
one
it
was
my
father
s
custom
to
invite
the
ministers
who
came
to
fairview
to
spend
the
day
at
our
house
that
they
might
be
convenient
for
the
evening
service
and
although
he
hesitated
a
long
while
in
this
case
as
if
afraid
the
accommodations
he
could
offer
were
not
good
enough
he
hurriedly
consulted
with
my
mother
at
the
last
moment
and
walked
out
to
the
gate
when
they
were
preparing
to
start
for
home
i
could
not
hear
from
where
i
stood
what
was
said
but
i
believed
the
invitation
had
been
given
and
accepted
and
when
he
began
to
look
around
the
yard
i
was
so
certain
that
i
was
wanted
to
drive
them
home
that
i
put
myself
in
his
way
as
the
wagon
road
led
through
lanes
and
gates
and
could
not
be
easily
described
my
mother
had
already
hurried
home
by
the
path
through
the
field
that
she
might
be
there
to
meet
them
when
i
went
up
to
the
wagon
in
response
to
my
father
s
beckon
he
lifted
me
into
the
seat
beside
shepherd
his
wife
and
daughter
occupying
the
back
one
and
said
i
would
show
the
way
and
open
the
gates
as
we
drove
off
i
felt
that
the
bright
eyes
of
the
girl
were
devouring
my
plain
coat
for
she
sat
directly
behind
me
and
i
regretted
i
had
not
thought
to
ask
jo
to
trim
my
hair
that
morning
the
grease
on
my
rough
boots
contrasted
sharply
with
the
polish
of
shepherd
s
patent
leathers
and
my
great
red
hands
were
larger
than
his
which
were
very
white
and
shaped
like
a
woman
s
i
soon
saw
he
was
a
poor
driver
and
asked
him
to
give
me
the
reins
which
he
willingly
did
with
a
apology
for
his
incapacity
pleading
lack
of
experience
in
that
direction
i
knew
they
wanted
to
talk
of
fairview
and
its
people
but
were
shy
of
me
so
i
pretended
to
be
busy
in
looking
after
the
horses
but
they
said
nothing
except
that
there
was
a
great
number
present
which
was
true
as
the
house
was
full
i
pointed
out
the
houses
as
we
went
along
and
tried
to
be
entertaining
old
lee
lives
there
i
said
as
we
passed
the
house
of
the
renter
on
our
farm
he
wasn
t
at
church
he
has
probably
gone
over
to
the
turkey
roost
in
bill
s
creek
i
had
said
it
to
shock
them
but
they
laughed
very
gayly
over
it
and
the
girl
i
had
heard
them
call
her
mateel
said
she
presumed
that
wild
turkeys
were
plentiful
i
had
secretly
been
longing
to
look
at
her
so
i
turned
partly
around
and
replied
that
the
woods
were
full
of
them
she
was
a
very
pretty
girl
dressed
more
expensively
than
i
had
ever
seen
agnes
dressed
but
not
with
so
much
taste
she
was
rather
pale
too
and
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
her
health
was
not
very
good
there
re
deer
here
too
i
said
to
them
finding
that
the
subject
promised
to
be
amusing
shepherd
and
the
girl
looked
very
much
interested
but
the
minister
s
wife
was
so
stately
and
dignified
that
i
felt
sure
i
could
never
be
comfortable
in
her
presence
one
came
running
through
our
field
once
when
jo
and
i
were
ploughing
i
continued
the
folks
were
away
at
and
jo
took
the
gun
and
went
after
it
i
heard
him
shoot
after
a
long
while
and
then
he
came
back
and
said
it
was
too
heavy
for
him
to
carry
home
but
that
if
i
would
finish
the
land
on
which
we
were
ploughing
while
he
rested
we
would
hitch
to
the
wagon
and
go
after
it
i
felt
so
pleased
about
it
that
i
finished
the
work
and
when
i
was
through
he
looked
at
the
sun
and
said
we
might
as
well
eat
supper
before
starting
and
that
i
had
better
take
the
harness
off
the
horses
while
they
were
feeding
as
they
would
be
more
comfortable
at
supper
he
asked
me
if
under
the
circumstances
i
didn
t
feel
it
a
duty
to
give
him
my
pie
which
i
did
and
after
he
had
eaten
it
he
took
me
to
one
side
and
said
that
though
he
was
ashamed
of
it
himself
he
was
compelled
to
confess
that
he
had
this
amused
them
more
than
ever
and
the
girl
asked
who
jo
was
this
reminded
me
that
i
had
neglected
my
friend
and
i
immediately
gave
a
short
and
glowing
history
of
him
not
failing
to
mention
that
he
knew
of
more
turkey
roosts
than
old
lee
and
that
we
would
visit
one
of
them
soon
and
return
by
their
house
with
a
fat
turkey
they
thanked
me
and
shepherd
even
said
he
would
like
to
go
with
us
whereupon
i
explained
the
process
of
killing
them
on
moonlight
nights
which
was
by
getting
them
between
your
gun
and
the
moon
where
they
could
be
easily
seen
i
should
no
doubt
have
told
them
other
things
equally
ridiculous
but
by
this
time
we
had
reached
the
gates
and
soon
thereafter
we
stopped
at
the
house
where
my
father
came
out
and
took
them
in
when
jo
appeared
to
help
me
with
the
horses
i
found
that
he
was
smartly
dressed
and
rightly
concluded
that
he
had
hurried
home
to
change
after
seeing
the
family
at
the
church
while
we
were
at
the
stables
he
asked
me
a
great
many
questions
about
the
girl
and
i
pleased
him
by
saying
that
i
had
talked
so
much
about
him
on
the
way
over
that
she
had
asked
me
who
he
was
and
that
i
had
replied
he
was
my
uncle
and
the
principal
young
man
in
fairview
what
did
she
say
then
he
asked
eagerly
that
she
desired
to
make
your
acquaintance
and
that
she
was
certain
she
had
picked
you
out
in
it
was
a
dreadful
lie
but
i
did
not
regret
it
seeing
how
well
he
was
pleased
then
what
did
you
say
he
asked
i
was
not
certain
what
would
please
him
most
so
i
replied
that
the
conversation
then
became
general
and
that
shepherd
had
said
he
would
go
with
us
some
night
to
the
turkey
roost
in
bill
s
creek
bottom
when
we
returned
to
the
house
the
three
were
sitting
alone
in
the
best
room
looking
idly
at
the
books
scattered
about
and
the
few
ornaments
my
mother
had
found
time
to
prepare
as
i
sat
down
on
the
sill
of
the
open
door
with
a
view
of
being
handy
in
case
i
was
wanted
i
regretted
that
agnes
was
not
there
to
entertain
them
for
she
had
gone
home
a
few
weeks
before
and
i
was
certain
they
would
have
been
surprised
to
find
such
a
bright
girl
in
that
dull
country
ha
shepherd
said
when
he
saw
me
the
young
man
that
drove
us
over
i
suppose
you
know
a
great
deal
about
horses
i
thought
he
made
the
last
remark
as
an
apology
that
he
had
not
attended
to
his
team
himself
so
i
replied
that
i
knew
something
about
them
but
i
was
sorry
he
had
chosen
that
subject
as
it
was
not
likely
to
interest
his
daughter
whom
i
was
anxious
to
talk
with
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
know
very
little
about
horses
he
said
but
i
intend
to
learn
i
bought
mine
at
the
station
where
we
left
the
railroad
what
do
you
think
of
them
with
a
view
of
bringing
jo
into
the
conversation
again
i
said
i
would
go
and
ask
his
opinion
as
he
was
a
very
good
judge
i
returned
presently
and
said
jo
thought
they
would
do
very
well
as
if
remembering
jo
as
a
very
amusing
person
i
had
been
telling
them
about
he
said
bring
the
young
man
in
i
should
like
to
talk
with
i
went
out
after
jo
but
did
not
go
far
as
he
had
slipped
up
near
the
door
which
stood
open
to
listen
to
what
was
being
said
he
was
very
red
in
the
face
but
followed
me
in
this
is
your
uncle
jo
is
it
shepherd
inquired
after
i
had
sat
down
again
leaving
jo
standing
awkwardly
in
the
middle
of
the
room
yes
sir
i
answered
having
a
vague
notion
i
ought
to
introduce
them
but
not
knowing
how
to
go
about
it
my
uncle
jo
erring
he
lives
shepherd
advanced
toward
him
pleasantly
and
i
thought
he
reached
him
just
in
time
to
keep
him
from
falling
down
with
fright
i
am
very
glad
to
know
you
erring
he
said
in
his
easy
way
taking
him
by
the
hand
this
is
my
wife
and
this
my
daughter
pointing
to
one
and
then
to
the
other
while
shaking
his
hand
i
have
no
doubt
we
shall
become
famous
jo
raised
his
eyes
to
recognize
the
introduction
and
he
said
to
me
afterwards
that
he
was
just
getting
ready
to
bolt
out
of
the
room
and
run
away
when
somehow
they
made
it
pleasant
for
him
to
stay
my
uncle
was
a
very
intelligent
fellow
and
he
soon
became
quite
entertaining
giving
them
accounts
of
the
country
and
the
people
which
were
no
doubt
very
droll
for
when
i
went
out
presently
i
heard
them
laughing
merrily
at
what
he
said
at
dinner
shepherd
observed
that
since
becoming
acquainted
with
erring
he
felt
like
an
old
citizen
whereupon
my
father
looked
up
hurriedly
and
was
about
to
ask
who
that
was
when
he
suddenly
remembered
and
muttered
oh
you
mean
it
was
sometimes
the
case
that
when
there
was
company
jo
and
i
were
compelled
to
wait
at
dinner
but
i
was
glad
that
on
this
day
jo
was
seated
next
mateel
and
did
not
suffer
the
humiliation
a
sort
of
rude
politeness
was
natural
to
him
and
on
this
occasion
he
displayed
it
to
such
advantage
that
i
glowed
with
pride
while
the
others
were
talking
of
graver
matters
he
gave
an
account
of
the
fairview
revivals
which
amused
mateel
so
much
that
she
asked
to
be
excused
for
laughing
i
had
never
seen
two
persons
get
along
better
together
and
i
felt
certain
that
she
would
regard
him
as
a
very
intelligent
young
man
which
pleased
me
for
nobody
else
seemed
to
do
him
justice
and
they
all
tried
to
humiliate
and
disgrace
him
whenever
it
was
possible
it
was
a
very
good
dinner
to
which
we
sat
down
and
the
shepherds
complimented
it
so
gracefully
that
my
mother
was
greatly
pleased
indeed
they
found
it
convenient
to
make
themselves
agreeable
to
all
of
us
so
that
the
afternoon
was
passed
very
pleasantly
more
so
than
any
other
sunday
afternoon
ever
passed
in
that
house
for
my
father
seemed
to
think
that
if
shepherd
with
all
his
learning
could
afford
to
throw
aside
his
sunday
gloom
he
would
risk
it
i
had
never
seen
him
in
so
good
a
humor
before
but
i
knew
he
would
make
up
for
it
the
next
day
for
whenever
he
was
he
was
always
particularly
gloomy
for
a
long
time
after
it
as
though
he
had
committed
an
indiscretion
of
which
he
was
ashamed
before
night
it
had
been
arranged
that
jo
should
drive
the
shepherds
home
after
the
service
as
it
would
be
very
dark
tying
a
horse
behind
the
wagon
on
which
to
ride
back
and
it
followed
that
he
drove
them
to
the
church
when
we
arrived
there
the
building
was
crowded
to
its
utmost
capacity
the
new
minister
was
a
success
chapter
viii
the
smoky
hill
secret
it
having
been
decided
to
begin
the
summer
school
a
few
weeks
earlier
than
at
first
intended
it
became
necessary
for
me
to
go
after
the
teacher
so
it
was
arranged
that
i
should
drive
over
to
smoky
hill
on
friday
and
return
any
time
the
following
day
my
mother
shared
the
feeling
that
the
neighborhood
where
agnes
lived
was
superior
to
ours
although
none
of
us
knew
why
we
had
this
impression
and
after
taking
unusual
pains
with
my
toilet
she
asked
jo
to
cut
my
hair
which
he
kindly
did
just
before
i
drove
away
in
the
wagon
from
the
high
seat
of
which
my
short
legs
barely
touched
the
floor
i
knew
nothing
of
the
settlement
except
the
direction
which
was
north
and
that
the
uncle
with
whom
agnes
lived
was
named
biggs
but
they
said
i
could
easily
inquire
the
way
the
distance
was
twenty
miles
and
by
repeated
inquiries
i
found
that
biggs
who
was
called
little
biggs
by
those
living
near
him
lived
in
the
first
white
house
after
crossing
the
north
fork
of
bull
river
and
when
i
came
in
sight
of
the
place
i
knew
it
as
well
as
if
i
had
lived
within
hailing
distance
all
my
life
it
was
just
such
a
place
as
i
expected
to
find
an
aristocratic
porch
on
two
sides
of
a
house
evidently
built
after
the
plans
of
an
architect
the
first
house
of
such
pretensions
i
had
ever
seen
with
a
gravel
walk
leading
down
to
the
gate
and
a
wide
and
neglected
yard
in
front
a
broken
and
dismantled
stood
in
the
and
around
it
was
piled
a
great
collection
of
farm
machinery
in
an
equally
advanced
stage
of
decay
all
rotting
away
for
lack
of
care
and
use
there
was
a
general
air
of
neglect
everywhere
and
i
thought
biggs
was
an
indifferent
farmer
or
else
an
invalid
boards
were
off
the
fences
and
gates
off
the
hinges
and
pigs
roamed
in
every
place
where
they
did
not
belong
a
herd
of
them
attracted
by
the
sound
of
my
wheels
dashed
out
from
under
the
porch
and
went
snorting
into
the
vegetable
garden
through
a
broken
fence
i
noticed
these
things
as
i
stopped
at
a
large
gate
intended
for
wagons
to
drive
through
and
while
wondering
whether
i
had
better
drive
in
there
or
tie
the
team
and
walk
up
to
the
house
while
debating
the
question
i
saw
that
a
large
young
man
was
pitching
hay
near
the
barn
and
noticing
that
he
had
stopped
his
work
and
was
looking
at
me
i
motioned
for
him
to
come
out
impatiently
throwing
down
his
fork
he
came
out
to
the
fence
and
resting
his
chin
on
the
top
board
he
looked
at
me
with
great
impudence
does
biggs
live
here
i
civilly
inquired
yes
biggs
lives
here
he
answered
drawling
the
first
word
as
if
to
express
disgust
well
then
i
said
if
you
will
open
the
gate
i
ll
come
he
threw
it
open
with
a
bang
as
if
to
express
an
unfavorable
opinion
of
me
and
i
drove
through
and
stopped
down
by
the
stables
he
followed
sullenly
after
banging
the
gate
again
and
picking
up
his
fork
without
looking
at
me
went
on
with
his
pitching
i
began
to
feel
uncomfortable
at
this
cool
reception
and
inquired
quite
respectfully
is
biggs
at
home
no
the
fellow
replied
he
s
not
at
home
plunging
his
fork
viciously
into
the
hay
as
though
he
were
wishing
i
was
under
it
is
miss
agnes
at
home
then
yes
miss
agnes
is
at
he
looked
up
in
better
humor
as
though
the
name
of
agnes
was
not
so
disagreeable
as
that
of
biggs
well
i
m
told
to
stay
here
and
take
agnes
to
her
school
if
you
ll
show
me
where
to
stand
the
horses
i
ll
put
them
he
laid
down
his
fork
at
this
and
went
to
look
through
the
stables
there
seemed
to
be
a
spring
somewhere
near
for
the
stalls
were
oozy
and
wet
and
unfit
for
use
and
the
fellow
was
debating
in
his
mind
which
was
the
worst
or
the
best
one
i
could
not
tell
which
finally
he
found
a
place
but
the
feed
boxes
were
gone
and
then
another
but
it
had
no
place
for
the
hay
i
was
following
him
around
by
this
time
and
said
the
last
one
would
do
very
well
as
it
was
the
best
one
there
he
helped
me
to
unhitch
the
horses
and
while
we
were
about
it
i
looked
up
at
the
house
and
saw
agnes
at
one
of
the
windows
she
went
away
immediately
however
and
i
supposed
she
would
be
down
to
welcome
me
but
she
didn
t
come
and
i
began
to
feel
very
uncomfortable
i
had
consoled
myself
for
the
rudeness
of
the
young
man
by
the
thought
that
he
would
be
very
much
ashamed
of
his
incivility
when
agnes
came
running
down
to
meet
me
but
she
didn
t
come
and
kept
away
from
the
window
and
i
was
uncertain
whether
i
had
better
return
home
or
seek
shelter
for
the
night
at
another
house
i
noticed
in
the
meantime
that
the
fellow
helping
me
was
a
giant
in
stature
and
that
he
had
a
very
little
head
on
which
was
perched
a
hat
evidently
bought
for
one
of
the
children
the
band
and
shape
being
gone
it
looked
very
much
like
an
inverted
i
suppose
you
are
the
preacher
s
boy
he
said
after
eying
me
a
long
while
as
though
that
was
a
very
good
reason
why
he
should
dislike
me
on
my
replying
that
such
was
the
case
he
looked
at
me
as
if
thinking
i
was
larger
or
smaller
than
he
had
imagined
and
continued
apparently
in
better
humor
i
have
heard
of
you
i
live
here
i
m
the
hired
man
my
name
is
big
adam
lazy
adam
calls
i
had
heard
that
little
eyes
denoted
cunning
and
little
ears
great
curiosity
and
big
adam
s
were
so
particularly
small
that
i
determined
to
be
very
wary
of
him
during
my
stay
she
owns
the
farm
though
biggs
pretends
to
own
it
big
adam
went
on
but
while
they
do
not
agree
in
this
they
agree
that
big
adam
hasn
t
enough
to
do
and
is
very
lazy
and
between
them
i
have
a
great
deal
of
trouble
i
do
all
the
work
that
is
done
here
and
though
you
may
think
from
looking
around
that
i
am
not
kept
very
busy
i
am
there
are
four
hundred
acres
here
and
they
expect
me
to
keep
it
in
a
high
state
of
cultivation
you
see
how
well
i
succeed
it
s
the
place
on
i
began
to
understand
him
better
and
said
it
looked
very
well
when
i
drove
up
may
be
it
does
from
the
road
but
i
haven
t
been
out
there
for
a
year
to
see
i
am
kept
too
busy
but
if
you
stay
here
long
i
ll
take
you
out
into
the
field
and
show
you
weeds
higher
than
your
head
instead
of
spending
the
money
to
mend
the
stables
and
fences
they
buy
more
land
with
it
to
give
big
adam
something
to
do
for
they
are
always
saying
that
i
am
fat
from
idleness
i
am
fat
but
not
from
idleness
i
haven
t
had
time
this
spring
to
comb
my
hair
look
at
he
took
off
the
hat
and
held
his
head
down
for
me
to
see
it
reminded
me
of
the
brush
heaps
in
which
we
found
rabbits
at
home
and
i
wished
jo
had
come
along
he
would
have
been
delighted
to
shingle
it
but
you
go
into
the
house
he
said
putting
on
his
hat
again
and
taking
up
the
fork
he
had
laid
down
to
hunt
a
stall
for
my
horses
you
ll
hear
enough
of
lazy
adam
in
there
they
ll
tell
you
i
m
lazy
and
shiftless
because
i
can
t
do
the
work
of
a
dozen
men
and
they
ll
tell
you
i
am
surly
because
i
can
t
cheerfully
go
ahead
and
do
all
they
ask
me
to
a
fine
opinion
of
big
adam
you
ll
have
when
you
go
away
but
i
ask
you
to
notice
while
you
are
here
if
big
adam
is
not
always
at
work
and
agnes
will
tell
you
she
is
the
only
one
among
them
who
pretends
to
tell
the
truth
that
she
has
never
seen
me
idle
but
go
on
into
the
house
i
am
not
allowed
to
talk
to
accepting
this
suggestion
i
went
through
a
gate
which
was
torn
off
its
hinges
and
lying
flat
in
the
path
and
walking
up
the
steps
i
knocked
timidly
at
the
front
door
while
waiting
for
some
one
to
answer
my
rap
i
noticed
a
hanging
on
one
screw
and
careening
my
head
around
read
lytle
i
then
understood
why
his
neighbors
called
him
little
biggs
it
was
his
name
i
hadn
t
time
to
congratulate
myself
on
this
discovery
for
just
then
the
flew
in
and
agnes
stood
before
me
although
she
was
friendly
to
me
as
usual
there
was
a
constraint
in
her
manner
that
i
could
not
understand
and
as
she
led
the
way
in
she
looked
as
though
she
was
expecting
the
house
to
blow
up
my
uncle
is
away
she
said
confusedly
after
we
were
seated
in
a
room
opening
off
from
the
hall
where
i
had
entered
but
we
expect
him
home
my
mother
is
not
well
and
demands
a
great
deal
of
care
or
i
should
have
come
down
to
the
gate
to
meet
you
when
you
drove
she
was
so
ill
at
ease
that
i
hurried
to
explain
my
errand
and
i
thought
she
was
greatly
relieved
to
know
i
had
not
come
on
a
visit
i
shall
be
ready
in
the
morning
at
any
time
you
are
she
said
and
i
wondered
she
could
leave
her
mother
for
i
had
been
fearing
that
perhaps
i
should
have
to
go
back
without
her
there
was
a
great
romp
and
noise
in
the
room
above
the
one
in
which
we
sat
and
she
looked
out
through
the
door
leading
into
the
hall
as
if
half
expecting
to
see
somebody
come
tumbling
down
the
stairs
my
uncle
s
children
she
said
seeing
i
wondered
at
the
noise
he
has
i
wondered
she
had
not
told
of
them
before
and
then
i
remembered
that
she
seldom
talked
of
her
uncle
s
family
or
of
her
mother
how
are
they
all
i
inquired
thinking
i
must
say
something
there
was
a
great
crash
in
the
room
overhead
and
a
cry
of
pain
and
agnes
went
quickly
to
the
door
to
listen
being
convinced
that
one
of
them
had
fallen
over
a
chair
she
came
back
and
replied
to
my
question
very
noisy
she
said
half
laughingly
i
fear
they
will
annoy
you
it
is
so
quiet
at
your
house
and
there
is
so
much
confusion
i
said
oh
not
at
all
not
knowing
what
other
reply
to
make
my
uncle
lytle
i
pricked
up
my
ears
at
this
as
her
pronunciation
of
her
uncle
s
name
was
different
from
that
given
it
by
his
neighbors
my
uncle
lytle
is
trying
to
bring
them
up
in
town
fashion
here
in
the
country
and
they
are
seldom
allowed
to
go
out
of
doors
so
that
they
can
t
be
blamed
for
being
rude
and
bad
all
of
them
except
the
baby
would
be
out
at
the
stables
with
big
adam
if
they
were
given
the
opportunity
but
their
father
s
orders
are
to
keep
them
away
from
the
stables
and
in
the
house
so
we
make
the
best
of
just
then
they
all
came
tearing
out
into
the
hall
above
to
the
stair
rail
and
i
knew
they
were
peeping
over
but
some
one
came
out
hurriedly
after
them
and
driving
them
all
back
into
the
room
again
shut
the
door
with
a
bang
they
are
anxious
to
see
you
agnes
said
smiling
they
have
the
greatest
curiosity
imaginable
there
will
be
no
peace
until
they
are
allowed
to
look
at
feeling
that
i
was
an
intruder
in
the
house
for
some
reason
i
suggested
that
she
let
them
come
down
promising
i
would
amuse
them
as
best
i
could
she
thought
a
moment
and
then
excusing
herself
went
out
after
a
long
time
i
heard
her
coming
back
with
them
six
of
them
rushed
into
the
room
ahead
of
her
and
taking
up
a
position
behind
the
chairs
looked
at
me
curiously
the
other
two
she
carried
in
her
arms
one
of
them
being
an
infant
not
more
than
four
or
five
months
old
they
seemed
a
queer
lot
to
me
their
clothing
being
of
a
pattern
i
had
never
seen
before
and
i
noticed
that
the
boys
wore
their
hair
in
long
curls
and
that
their
frocks
were
braided
all
of
their
faces
were
pale
which
did
not
result
solely
from
their
being
lately
washed
and
the
older
boys
were
dressed
in
short
trousers
and
wore
shoes
though
it
was
summer
a
peculiarity
which
attracted
my
attention
particularly
because
most
of
the
boys
i
had
known
went
barefooted
agnes
placed
the
baby
on
my
knee
and
i
soon
had
all
the
children
about
me
asking
questions
and
going
through
my
pockets
indeed
i
succeeded
very
well
in
amusing
them
while
they
were
playing
around
i
heard
some
one
come
down
the
stairs
and
go
down
the
hall
to
a
door
which
i
judged
led
into
the
kitchen
presently
agnes
went
out
too
and
i
supposed
they
were
making
arrangements
for
supper
which
thought
was
probably
suggested
by
the
fact
that
it
was
late
and
that
i
was
very
hungry
the
children
amused
themselves
with
me
for
a
considerable
time
and
were
more
noisy
than
ever
when
unfortunately
one
of
them
fell
headlong
over
a
chair
and
set
up
a
most
terrible
cry
immediately
a
little
old
woman
came
hurrying
into
the
room
who
picking
up
the
screaming
one
and
roughly
taking
the
baby
out
of
my
arms
drove
them
all
up
the
stairs
before
her
slapping
and
banging
them
as
they
went
so
that
they
were
all
screaming
by
the
time
the
door
up
stairs
closed
upon
them
while
she
was
collecting
them
i
saw
that
the
newcomer
s
hair
was
twisted
behind
her
head
in
a
tight
little
knot
and
that
she
was
very
slender
and
very
short
that
her
features
were
small
and
sharp
and
like
a
mummy
s
and
that
altogether
she
was
the
most
creature
i
had
ever
seen
i
half
expected
that
she
would
give
me
a
rap
as
she
went
out
she
looked
so
sour
and
ugly
i
supposed
she
was
a
servant
possibly
adam
s
mother
and
when
agnes
came
in
which
she
did
a
moment
after
looking
very
much
frightened
i
had
it
in
my
mind
to
say
that
the
old
woman
of
the
sky
had
swept
the
children
away
with
a
broomstick
i
was
afraid
they
would
annoy
you
she
said
hurriedly
as
though
it
was
necessary
to
say
something
before
i
could
remark
on
the
queer
little
old
woman
who
had
driven
them
away
i
was
about
to
reply
that
we
were
getting
along
very
well
until
one
of
them
fell
down
when
she
continued
my
uncle
has
just
driven
up
he
is
coming
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
softly
and
a
very
small
and
handsomely
dressed
man
stepped
into
the
room
he
spoke
to
agnes
pleasantly
and
as
he
looked
inquiringly
at
me
she
explained
one
of
my
pupils
from
fairview
ned
westlock
i
shall
go
home
with
him
as
the
school
opens
a
week
earlier
than
was
i
knew
now
why
his
neighbors
called
him
little
biggs
because
he
was
very
short
and
very
thin
and
very
little
ah
ned
after
he
had
said
this
he
looked
at
me
very
attentively
while
he
removed
his
gloves
placing
them
in
his
tall
hat
he
set
both
away
and
came
back
to
me
i
am
very
glad
to
know
you
biggs
said
i
am
glad
to
have
you
a
guest
at
our
this
was
encouraging
as
nobody
else
had
said
as
much
and
i
felt
better
i
need
not
apologize
he
said
for
the
rough
but
honest
ways
of
us
farmers
looking
admiringly
at
his
thin
legs
and
brushing
at
a
speck
of
dirt
which
seemed
to
be
on
one
of
them
for
i
believe
you
come
of
an
agricultural
family
i
was
surprised
at
this
reference
to
his
rough
ways
for
he
was
extremely
fastidious
in
his
dress
and
manner
i
managed
to
admit
however
that
i
came
of
an
agricultural
family
those
of
us
who
live
in
the
country
and
earn
our
bread
in
the
sweat
of
our
brow
biggs
went
on
seating
himself
beside
me
can
not
be
particular
our
clothing
our
food
and
our
ways
are
rough
but
substantial
and
honest
we
have
other
matters
to
look
after
such
as
following
the
plough
sowing
the
grain
and
tossing
the
hay
we
may
have
our
ambitions
like
other
men
but
they
are
dwarfed
and
bent
by
holding
the
plough
and
pitching
the
hay
when
did
you
come
and
how
long
do
you
stay
i
replied
that
i
had
arrived
but
a
few
hours
before
and
that
i
would
depart
the
next
day
at
any
hour
agnes
was
ready
i
am
sorry
biggs
was
good
enough
to
say
i
should
be
delighted
to
show
you
how
we
carry
on
a
four
hundred
acre
farm
other
great
farmers
have
from
four
to
a
dozen
hired
men
about
them
but
big
adam
and
i
do
all
the
work
here
and
we
are
equal
to
it
though
it
keeps
us
very
busy
as
you
will
imagine
we
have
no
time
for
the
fine
arts
you
may
be
he
ran
on
gayly
in
this
way
making
himself
out
in
ignorance
and
muscle
the
equal
of
one
of
our
fairview
farmers
although
he
was
really
nothing
else
to
my
mind
than
a
fop
until
agnes
came
in
and
said
we
were
to
walk
out
to
supper
there
was
no
one
in
the
supper
room
when
we
entered
it
and
although
i
expected
other
members
of
the
family
every
moment
none
came
agnes
was
there
most
of
the
time
but
did
not
sit
down
and
supplied
the
place
of
a
servant
those
of
us
who
live
in
the
country
said
biggs
helping
me
to
meat
and
bread
with
the
greatest
ceremony
can
not
be
particular
as
to
what
we
eat
except
that
it
is
substantial
and
hearty
meat
and
bread
and
milk
make
muscle
and
muscle
is
in
great
demand
on
a
farm
big
adam
and
i
find
a
great
deal
of
it
necessary
in
tilling
these
four
hundred
acres
therefore
we
insist
on
plenty
of
plain
and
substantial
food
excuse
me
if
i
eat
like
a
the
supper
was
a
very
good
one
but
he
talked
a
great
deal
about
its
being
plain
but
hearty
and
although
he
was
dainty
in
his
eating
and
ate
nothing
but
bread
and
milk
and
toasted
bread
and
tea
he
kept
apologizing
for
his
ravenous
appetite
he
had
something
to
say
too
about
shovelling
in
his
food
with
a
knife
and
bolting
it
he
did
neither
but
on
the
contrary
was
very
delicate
and
as
he
kept
watching
me
i
thought
that
he
must
be
apologizing
for
his
guest
which
made
me
very
uncomfortable
at
my
bad
manners
for
up
to
that
time
i
had
not
been
backward
in
falling
to
but
as
he
continued
to
denounce
his
unnatural
craving
for
food
and
frequently
expressed
the
fear
that
the
meal
lacked
so
much
of
what
i
was
accustomed
to
that
i
could
not
possibly
make
out
a
comfortable
supper
i
finally
made
up
my
mind
he
did
not
mean
me
at
all
when
i
had
finished
he
was
waiting
for
me
and
we
adjourned
to
the
room
in
which
i
had
played
with
the
children
lighting
a
cigar
which
he
said
was
a
very
poor
one
but
which
he
observed
in
the
course
of
the
evening
as
an
example
of
his
extravagance
had
cost
twenty
cents
he
took
a
from
a
closet
and
putting
it
on
sat
down
before
me
the
picture
of
luxurious
ease
while
we
sat
there
i
heard
the
family
of
eight
accompanied
by
their
mother
and
the
little
old
woman
who
had
frightened
me
come
banging
down
the
stairs
and
file
into
the
supper
room
where
there
were
a
steady
noise
and
wrangle
until
they
had
finished
and
gone
up
the
stairs
again
i
heard
big
adam
protesting
to
some
one
that
it
was
not
pleasant
to
be
always
jawed
at
and
that
he
did
all
he
could
but
when
the
argument
threatened
to
become
boisterous
i
heard
a
pleasanter
voice
intercede
and
establish
a
peace
and
i
was
sure
this
was
agnes
s
biggs
stopped
once
or
twice
to
listen
to
the
confusion
as
if
trying
to
hear
what
was
being
said
but
recollecting
that
if
he
could
hear
i
could
as
well
he
began
talking
again
to
draw
my
attention
from
it
he
tried
to
make
me
believe
the
children
were
making
the
disturbance
and
said
there
can
be
no
order
in
a
house
full
of
children
and
very
little
he
stopped
to
think
a
moment
but
the
uproar
in
the
supper
room
was
so
great
that
he
went
on
trying
to
draw
my
attention
away
from
it
i
confess
to
thinking
something
of
them
but
every
pleasure
they
bring
is
accompanied
by
inconvenience
expense
and
annoyance
have
i
told
you
yet
that
i
am
a
philosopher
i
had
suspected
that
something
was
wrong
with
him
though
i
could
not
tell
what
it
was
i
replied
politely
however
that
he
had
not
well
i
am
one
the
little
man
said
with
a
show
of
pride
a
great
many
men
regard
children
as
blessings
now
i
have
failed
to
discover
any
kind
of
a
blessing
or
pleasure
in
being
called
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
run
for
a
doctor
when
there
is
croup
in
the
house
usually
too
in
such
cases
the
medical
man
lives
a
great
many
miles
away
over
a
rough
road
whenever
i
go
to
bed
early
to
make
up
lost
sleep
or
come
home
particularly
tired
from
tossing
the
hay
or
holding
the
plough
either
annie
or
bennie
or
carrie
or
davie
or
effie
or
fannie
or
georgie
or
harry
is
sick
and
i
am
compelled
to
go
for
a
doctor
this
never
fails
if
the
night
is
very
wet
the
roads
unusually
heavy
or
the
weather
particularly
cold
while
everybody
admires
little
children
i
am
sure
they
would
be
much
more
popular
if
their
teeth
came
more
easily
and
that
there
would
be
a
greater
demand
for
them
if
they
did
not
take
a
hundred
different
diseases
to
which
they
are
not
exposed
i
am
that
kind
of
the
fire
in
the
end
of
his
cigar
having
about
gone
out
from
holding
it
in
his
hand
and
waving
it
at
me
he
revived
it
with
a
great
deal
of
puffing
and
went
on
understand
me
ned
westlock
i
do
not
complain
i
am
like
other
men
except
that
i
am
not
a
fool
and
while
i
accept
the
bitter
with
the
sweet
i
point
out
the
bitter
and
refuse
to
call
it
palatable
i
am
at
a
loss
to
understand
for
example
why
the
creator
is
more
considerate
of
pigs
than
he
is
of
children
for
i
believe
pigs
cut
their
teeth
before
birth
and
seldom
die
except
when
fat
from
good
health
and
at
the
hands
of
a
butcher
children
on
the
other
hand
he
used
his
right
hand
to
represent
the
pigs
and
his
left
to
represent
the
children
are
never
well
and
for
every
tooth
there
is
an
insolent
doctor
with
a
bill
to
say
nothing
of
measles
coughs
rashes
and
fevers
i
have
seen
it
estimated
that
it
requires
three
thousand
eight
hundred
and
dollars
and
or
forty
cents
to
raise
a
baby
to
manhood
or
womanhood
a
pig
may
be
raised
to
maturity
with
a
few
hundred
buckets
of
slop
a
few
bushels
of
corn
and
a
wisp
of
hay
occasionally
for
a
bed
what
do
you
think
of
that
as
he
looked
at
me
as
though
i
had
been
stubbornly
arguing
the
cause
of
the
children
i
replied
that
the
pigs
had
the
best
of
it
so
far
decidedly
if
you
have
never
talked
with
a
philosopher
before
you
may
never
have
had
your
attention
called
to
the
fact
which
possibly
has
escaped
your
own
notice
that
children
do
not
appreciate
good
treatment
as
do
pigs
and
other
animals
the
very
worst
thing
you
can
do
for
a
boy
is
to
treat
him
well
where
do
you
find
the
good
boys
he
made
a
pause
as
if
expecting
a
reply
and
i
said
i
don
t
know
but
i
knew
at
once
that
he
was
impatient
that
i
had
replied
for
he
wanted
to
do
all
the
talking
himself
in
families
where
boys
are
always
hungry
and
abused
he
resumed
where
do
you
find
your
bad
boys
in
families
where
they
are
treated
well
of
course
a
boy
who
has
plenty
to
eat
and
plenty
to
wear
and
nothing
to
do
is
always
impudent
and
worthless
and
parents
who
go
to
trouble
and
expense
that
their
children
may
be
happy
and
idle
pay
a
big
price
for
a
pestilence
i
do
not
pretend
to
say
that
in
practice
i
am
more
of
a
philosopher
than
my
neighbors
but
it
is
a
fact
nevertheless
that
the
pig
that
slips
into
the
house
and
litters
it
up
is
beaten
with
a
broomstick
until
he
understands
when
tempted
on
future
occasions
that
the
practice
is
dangerous
if
the
pigs
get
on
the
porch
and
you
open
the
door
suddenly
they
run
away
in
great
haste
having
been
taught
by
harsh
means
that
they
are
not
expected
there
and
if
we
would
teach
children
in
the
same
way
we
should
have
more
comfort
with
them
but
practically
we
regard
the
training
of
pigs
as
more
important
than
the
training
of
children
and
suffer
much
discomfort
in
consequence
i
recognize
certain
inexorable
masters
and
obey
them
to
avoid
uncomfortable
consequences
and
a
child
must
have
a
master
or
it
will
become
disagreeable
and
he
stopped
to
listen
to
the
noise
made
by
his
family
up
stairs
it
was
very
uproarious
and
i
thought
he
was
regretting
that
his
philosophy
had
not
been
made
to
bear
some
practical
fruit
if
you
were
a
young
man
he
continued
coming
out
of
a
brown
study
and
had
driven
from
fairview
to
ask
my
advice
on
this
question
i
should
advise
you
thus
sir
if
you
covet
the
society
of
little
children
hire
them
to
play
at
your
house
until
you
are
tired
for
then
you
can
send
them
away
and
enjoy
the
quiet
following
their
absence
you
will
find
that
pleasant
enough
but
if
you
have
a
house
full
of
your
own
that
alters
the
case
for
like
the
deserving
poor
they
then
are
always
with
you
in
sickness
as
well
as
in
health
and
when
they
are
disagreeable
as
well
as
when
they
are
that
would
be
my
candid
advice
you
may
accept
it
or
let
it
alone
as
you
he
waved
the
hand
at
me
which
he
had
previously
used
to
represent
the
pigs
as
though
i
had
been
asking
him
to
counsel
me
on
the
subject
and
as
if
he
were
impatient
that
i
did
not
accept
his
advice
at
once
but
recollecting
himself
he
took
a
delicate
knife
from
his
pocket
and
after
profuse
apologies
for
his
proceeded
to
pare
his
finger
nails
looking
occasionally
at
me
as
if
doubting
my
ability
to
understand
his
philosophy
for
i
had
scarcely
said
a
word
in
reply
to
it
i
understand
your
father
is
a
singer
he
said
after
his
fingers
were
mentally
pronounced
satisfactory
i
replied
with
a
show
of
pride
that
he
had
the
finest
voice
ever
heard
in
fairview
church
and
that
he
was
famous
for
it
he
ought
to
stop
it
biggs
abruptly
said
people
enjoy
his
singing
i
have
no
doubt
but
if
he
were
a
friend
of
mine
i
have
not
even
the
pleasure
of
his
acquaintance
i
would
say
to
him
quit
singing
reverend
john
if
you
would
become
how
does
it
come
he
is
not
in
the
legislature
because
he
sings
the
people
do
not
associate
statesmanship
with
singing
when
a
man
is
honored
for
singing
he
is
honored
for
little
else
did
you
ever
know
a
great
man
who
sang
i
replied
that
i
had
not
for
i
had
never
known
a
great
man
well
he
answered
curtly
i
know
them
all
and
none
of
them
sing
or
play
the
darkey
who
can
sing
and
dance
is
popular
with
an
idle
crowd
but
the
solid
people
who
have
gardens
to
spade
or
walls
to
whitewash
avoid
the
musical
negro
for
his
talent
is
likely
to
be
exhausted
in
that
direction
i
don
t
pretend
to
know
why
it
is
against
a
man
that
he
is
able
to
entertain
people
with
his
voice
or
with
the
skill
of
his
fingers
i
only
know
it
is
the
case
it
would
be
a
kindness
for
somebody
to
say
as
much
to
reverend
john
you
may
convey
the
information
to
him
with
my
compliments
if
you
i
had
been
wishing
all
evening
that
agnes
would
come
in
and
ask
me
to
sing
as
i
thought
i
had
talent
in
that
direction
and
even
debated
in
my
mind
whether
i
would
roar
the
hunter
s
horn
or
glorious
day
of
rest
for
the
amusement
of
my
host
but
i
was
now
glad
she
had
been
so
considerate
of
my
feelings
and
spared
me
the
humiliation
i
was
quite
certain
that
if
she
should
ask
me
to
sing
after
what
biggs
had
said
i
should
declare
i
had
never
attempted
to
do
such
a
ridiculous
thing
every
man
who
tells
an
uncomfortable
truth
biggs
began
again
after
lighting
a
fresh
cigar
by
the
remains
of
the
old
one
is
called
a
beast
i
am
called
a
beast
in
this
neighborhood
which
is
known
for
taxing
and
voting
purposes
as
smoky
hill
because
i
tell
a
great
many
unpalatable
truths
i
have
eyes
and
intelligence
therefore
i
can
not
help
noticing
and
mentioning
that
the
people
of
this
country
pay
more
attention
to
raising
stock
than
to
raising
children
which
you
must
admit
is
ridiculous
i
hear
that
the
meek
for
instance
has
his
stable
full
of
fine
stock
and
his
house
full
of
children
the
meek
is
evidently
an
ass
i
m
glad
i
do
not
know
him
if
i
did
i
should
make
myself
disagreeable
by
mentioning
the
i
may
as
well
mention
here
that
biggs
was
not
the
kind
of
man
he
claimed
to
be
on
the
contrary
he
made
his
living
by
indorsing
the
follies
of
other
people
but
he
had
pointed
out
their
mistakes
to
himself
so
often
that
i
suppose
he
really
believed
he
was
generally
despised
for
telling
the
truth
we
have
many
of
the
same
kind
of
men
in
smoky
hill
it
affords
me
pleasure
to
assure
you
that
i
am
unpopular
with
them
and
they
take
great
comfort
in
the
belief
that
i
am
likely
to
die
in
a
year
or
two
of
consumption
but
i
have
already
had
the
satisfaction
of
attending
the
funerals
of
five
men
who
predicted
that
i
was
not
long
for
the
world
i
expect
to
help
bury
the
rest
of
them
at
intervals
in
the
future
while
i
get
a
little
stronger
every
year
by
care
and
common
sense
they
get
a
little
weaker
by
carelessness
and
ignorance
and
finally
they
are
buried
with
biggs
the
consumptive
looking
contentedly
on
the
trouble
with
these
men
is
that
they
eat
everything
coming
in
their
way
like
pigs
lacking
observation
to
teach
them
that
a
greater
number
of
people
die
of
than
die
of
or
the
last
smoky
hill
glutton
that
died
was
the
most
worthy
chief
of
a
temperance
society
and
he
was
always
quarreling
with
his
wife
because
she
didn
t
have
pie
for
breakfast
for
my
part
i
detest
i
was
about
to
say
that
while
i
agreed
with
him
in
everything
else
i
should
be
compelled
to
make
an
exception
in
the
pie
particular
but
he
did
not
give
me
opportunity
for
he
proceeded
in
my
visits
to
the
homes
of
cultured
but
unwise
people
i
am
frequently
tempted
to
do
violence
to
my
stomach
by
eating
late
at
night
but
recollecting
the
fate
of
the
smoky
hill
men
i
respectfully
decline
when
i
am
offered
cake
and
nightmare
in
other
forms
i
do
not
greedily
accept
and
devour
everything
set
before
me
but
instead
i
say
if
you
have
cold
oatmeal
mush
or
a
bit
of
graham
bread
i
will
refresh
myself
with
that
but
no
cake
i
thank
you
although
the
assortment
is
fine
and
reflects
great
credit
on
the
lady
of
the
thus
i
preserve
my
health
and
prove
my
philosophy
but
no
doubt
i
am
wearying
you
i
will
show
you
to
he
did
not
ask
me
whether
i
was
tired
of
his
company
but
picked
up
the
light
as
though
he
could
decide
questions
for
boys
without
their
assistance
and
leading
the
way
up
stairs
i
meekly
followed
opening
a
door
after
reaching
the
upper
floor
he
gave
me
the
light
said
good
night
and
went
down
again
as
though
he
had
not
had
enough
of
his
own
company
and
would
sit
up
a
while
longer
there
were
two
comfortable
beds
in
the
room
to
which
biggs
had
shown
me
and
big
adam
occupied
one
of
them
already
sound
asleep
his
clothes
were
piled
up
in
a
heap
by
the
side
of
it
with
the
hat
on
top
ready
to
go
on
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
he
mumbled
occasionally
in
his
sleep
and
i
thought
he
was
saying
he
did
the
best
he
could
and
that
it
wasn
t
pleasant
to
be
jawed
at
which
made
me
think
again
of
the
terrible
old
woman
with
the
parchment
face
the
little
head
the
little
body
and
the
little
knot
of
hair
on
the
back
of
her
head
i
felt
like
kneeling
down
by
my
bed
and
praying
that
the
queer
woman
might
not
have
a
habit
of
walking
through
the
house
at
night
accompanied
by
the
kitchen
freshly
sharpened
at
the
grindstone
for
there
was
no
lock
on
the
door
but
speedily
occupying
the
other
bed
and
putting
out
the
light
i
had
hardly
begun
thinking
of
the
curious
family
before
i
was
sound
asleep
chapter
ix
the
charity
of
silence
when
i
went
down
to
breakfast
the
next
morning
i
found
agnes
waiting
for
me
and
the
meal
ready
and
as
was
the
case
the
night
before
she
presided
at
the
table
without
sitting
down
i
ate
alone
and
in
silence
as
it
was
explained
that
biggs
was
not
yet
up
though
it
was
late
and
agnes
did
not
seem
to
be
in
a
mood
for
talking
the
circumstance
that
other
members
of
the
family
kept
out
of
the
room
made
me
think
that
i
was
regarded
in
the
house
as
a
sort
of
a
machine
likely
to
explode
and
hurt
somebody
and
could
be
approached
only
by
those
who
knew
where
the
safety
valve
was
which
blew
me
off
for
i
supposed
biggs
and
deming
to
be
very
aristocratic
people
who
could
not
tolerate
a
boy
therefore
i
did
not
feel
in
very
good
humor
myself
thinking
that
agnes
was
ashamed
to
exhibit
me
to
her
friends
going
out
to
the
stables
in
lazy
preparation
for
returning
home
i
found
big
adam
pitching
hay
as
i
had
left
him
the
day
before
well
young
westlock
how
are
you
now
he
inquired
leaning
on
his
fork
i
returned
his
greeting
and
said
i
would
hitch
up
when
he
had
time
to
help
me
you
needn
t
be
in
a
hurry
about
it
he
said
returning
to
his
work
if
i
were
you
i
would
manage
to
get
home
just
at
dark
for
then
you
ll
have
nothing
to
do
during
the
day
if
you
get
back
too
early
the
preacher
may
find
something
for
you
to
there
was
a
good
deal
of
truth
in
this
and
i
thanked
him
for
the
suggestion
i
know
something
about
hired
help
and
boys
on
a
farm
i
have
had
a
ripe
experience
in
the
service
of
biggs
i
thought
he
would
talk
you
to
death
last
night
it
s
a
terrible
death
to
die
what
did
he
say
i
repeated
portions
of
the
conversation
and
gave
particular
stress
to
what
he
had
said
concerning
his
and
big
adam
s
doing
the
work
of
half
a
dozen
men
he
is
always
saying
that
big
adam
said
indignantly
but
i
assure
you
on
my
honor
that
he
never
held
a
plough
or
pitched
hay
a
day
in
his
life
why
he
is
not
here
a
third
of
his
time
he
came
home
last
night
after
an
absence
of
four
weeks
i
don
t
know
where
he
has
been
but
to
some
of
the
towns
a
long
way
off
probably
at
ten
or
eleven
o
clock
he
will
breakfast
and
then
i
shall
hitch
up
and
drive
him
over
the
place
during
which
time
he
will
point
out
and
suggest
enough
work
to
keep
a
dozen
men
busy
for
months
and
after
assuring
me
it
ought
all
to
be
done
before
night
he
will
return
to
the
house
to
lounge
about
in
a
day
or
two
he
will
go
away
again
and
come
back
when
he
gets
ready
that
s
the
kind
of
a
farmer
biggs
is
but
i
must
say
for
him
that
he
is
quiet
and
peaceable
i
wish
i
could
say
as
much
for
his
sister
the
old
up
to
this
time
big
adam
had
been
wearing
his
hat
so
far
back
on
his
head
that
i
was
wondering
it
did
not
fall
off
but
as
if
there
were
some
people
so
contemptible
that
he
could
not
possibly
mention
them
without
showing
his
temper
he
jerked
the
hat
over
on
his
low
forehead
when
he
said
this
and
looking
out
from
under
it
with
his
little
eyes
viciously
said
and
who
is
his
sister
i
asked
old
missus
deming
agnes
s
mother
the
little
old
woman
they
were
careful
you
should
not
it
came
to
me
all
at
once
how
foolish
of
me
not
to
have
thought
of
it
before
why
agnes
never
talked
about
her
mother
and
why
she
always
seemed
to
be
glad
to
be
away
from
her
she
was
disagreeable
not
only
to
big
adam
but
to
every
one
around
her
i
understood
now
that
agnes
was
frightened
when
i
first
came
for
fear
i
should
see
her
mother
and
not
for
fear
her
mother
would
see
me
as
i
had
imagined
and
i
felt
so
much
better
that
i
had
a
mind
to
walk
in
the
yard
in
plain
view
of
the
house
that
deming
might
regret
not
having
made
my
acquaintance
i
told
adam
that
i
had
seen
her
however
and
narrated
the
circumstance
of
her
appearance
in
the
room
after
the
children
the
hired
man
expressed
his
satisfaction
at
this
very
much
as
i
have
seen
young
colts
express
it
by
kicking
his
legs
out
in
various
directions
and
snorting
after
he
had
enjoyed
himself
in
this
manner
for
a
while
he
said
it
s
just
like
her
though
they
might
have
known
better
than
to
have
left
her
alone
it
s
a
wonder
she
didn
t
hit
you
i
wish
she
had
for
then
you
would
despise
her
as
i
he
continued
to
chuckle
to
himself
as
though
it
was
a
satisfaction
to
him
that
i
had
seen
his
enemy
and
putting
his
finger
in
his
mouth
he
drew
it
out
in
such
a
manner
that
it
sounded
like
pulling
a
cork
then
thumping
his
jaws
he
made
a
sound
of
liquor
coming
out
of
a
bottle
this
pantomime
i
interpreted
to
mean
that
if
he
were
better
off
he
would
celebrate
the
event
with
something
expensive
to
drink
i
found
out
afterward
that
this
was
a
habit
with
him
when
in
a
good
humor
and
he
had
acquired
such
skill
by
practice
that
if
your
back
was
turned
to
him
the
deception
was
perfect
she
s
the
worst
woman
on
earth
he
continued
leading
me
behind
the
barn
to
be
more
confidential
they
say
she
never
smiled
in
her
life
and
i
believe
it
she
grumbles
and
growls
and
jaws
from
morning
until
night
but
what
can
they
do
bless
you
she
owns
the
farm
i
looked
astonished
to
induce
him
to
go
on
yes
she
owns
the
place
and
you
bet
she
looks
after
it
when
she
came
here
with
agnes
six
or
seven
years
ago
her
brother
had
a
great
tract
of
land
bought
on
credit
and
she
paid
for
it
with
the
money
she
brought
along
and
built
the
house
you
slept
in
last
night
since
then
she
has
been
so
disagreeable
that
biggs
is
seldom
at
home
and
won
t
see
her
when
he
is
did
you
see
his
wife
i
replied
that
i
had
been
denied
that
pleasure
you
would
have
seen
a
sight
if
you
had
a
woman
who
hasn
t
combed
her
hair
for
six
years
because
she
has
that
old
hen
to
look
after
besides
the
care
of
the
children
i
don
t
believe
she
ever
sleeps
for
if
i
wake
up
in
the
night
she
is
either
being
railed
at
by
that
she
devil
or
is
up
with
the
children
i
believe
she
is
the
only
person
living
whose
lot
is
worse
than
mine
when
i
am
in
the
field
i
am
out
of
my
misery
but
she
never
has
that
opportunity
of
escaping
hers
when
agnes
is
away
i
often
cook
my
own
meals
and
i
am
the
only
one
besides
agnes
that
pays
her
any
attention
except
to
keep
a
family
of
children
around
her
i
think
biggs
never
notices
her
and
when
he
is
at
home
he
occupies
a
room
away
from
the
noise
and
confusion
but
she
is
patient
and
never
complains
although
there
is
no
hope
for
the
old
woman
will
outlive
us
all
she
lives
on
growling
and
grumbling
for
she
is
afraid
to
eat
for
fear
of
poison
and
hesitates
to
sleep
for
visions
of
strangling
she
talks
about
poisoning
and
strangling
for
hours
at
a
stretch
and
accuses
the
biggses
of
wanting
to
murder
her
because
she
knows
it
humiliates
them
i
hear
that
her
late
husband
was
a
fine
fellow
a
sea
captain
he
was
a
very
sensible
man
i
judge
for
he
drowned
himself
rather
than
live
with
her
i
think
a
great
deal
of
captain
deming
s
memory
he
is
the
only
great
man
i
know
even
by
reputation
here
s
to
he
pulled
another
cork
which
appeared
to
come
with
difficulty
and
thumped
on
his
jaws
to
represent
the
gurgling
of
liquor
as
it
flows
out
of
the
bottle
agnes
is
like
him
it
will
be
a
great
relief
to
her
to
go
home
with
you
does
she
ever
talk
of
her
mother
no
i
answered
i
thought
not
nor
does
she
ever
talk
of
the
devil
but
i
ll
be
bound
she
talks
a
great
deal
of
her
father
i
think
agnes
will
never
marry
preferring
to
remain
an
old
maid
rather
than
introduce
a
husband
to
her
mother
and
i
don
t
blame
her
she
complains
during
the
few
weeks
that
the
poor
girl
is
at
home
because
agnes
is
not
away
earning
money
for
her
into
which
goes
every
dollar
of
it
if
agnes
has
any
money
biggs
gives
it
to
her
for
she
has
to
account
for
every
penny
of
her
earnings
to
her
mother
who
says
she
needs
that
and
more
to
buy
something
decent
to
wear
she
talks
a
great
deal
about
having
nothing
decent
to
wear
as
if
anything
would
look
well
on
her
angular
old
bones
except
a
what
does
biggs
do
for
a
living
i
asked
anxious
to
know
as
much
about
the
family
as
possible
to
be
candid
with
you
big
adam
replied
in
a
confidential
way
i
don
t
know
although
he
has
some
way
of
making
money
for
he
always
has
it
he
organizes
the
farmers
for
one
thing
and
is
a
member
of
the
legislature
for
another
once
he
started
a
farmers
store
here
at
a
place
over
in
the
hills
there
pointing
in
the
direction
where
the
roads
cross
and
where
the
smoky
hill
is
kept
he
told
the
people
they
must
organize
for
protection
and
he
somehow
made
them
agree
to
patronize
his
store
if
he
would
start
one
they
were
honest
men
who
made
the
agreement
and
lived
up
to
it
a
long
while
but
in
time
they
found
out
that
he
was
charging
them
a
great
deal
more
for
his
goods
than
the
dangerous
men
he
had
warned
them
against
in
town
i
was
in
the
place
when
they
came
in
to
hang
him
and
one
man
walked
up
to
the
and
wanted
to
know
how
much
rope
would
be
necessary
but
biggs
made
them
a
speech
from
a
vinegar
barrel
and
so
worked
upon
their
feelings
that
they
went
away
content
with
the
harmless
revenge
of
calling
him
a
little
whiffet
biggs
put
me
in
charge
and
galloped
away
to
find
a
purchaser
for
his
store
he
found
one
by
representing
that
an
entire
neighborhood
of
fools
had
signed
an
agreement
to
pay
him
in
cash
whatever
price
he
asked
for
his
goods
the
purchaser
wanted
to
shoot
biggs
when
he
found
out
how
matters
really
stood
for
he
had
paid
a
big
price
but
for
some
reason
he
changed
his
mind
biggs
is
that
kind
of
man
now
you
know
as
much
about
him
as
i
as
though
he
had
been
idling
away
too
much
time
already
big
adam
began
to
work
with
great
energy
and
refused
to
talk
any
more
so
i
put
the
horses
to
the
wagon
alone
but
after
i
had
driven
through
the
gate
and
into
the
road
he
came
out
as
if
there
was
one
word
more
he
desired
to
say
and
lifting
himself
up
by
putting
one
foot
on
the
wheel
he
whispered
in
my
ear
my
father
was
killed
by
the
he
looked
so
distressed
that
i
expressed
some
sort
of
regret
and
said
it
was
a
pity
he
added
giving
me
his
hand
my
last
name
is
casebolt
my
mother
is
married
the
second
i
shook
his
great
fat
hand
again
and
he
went
back
to
his
work
driving
round
to
the
front
of
the
house
i
found
agnes
waiting
for
me
and
lifting
her
little
trunk
into
the
wagon
we
drove
away
no
one
appearing
at
the
doors
or
windows
to
bid
her
my
mother
had
told
me
to
invite
deming
to
visit
her
but
out
of
regard
for
agnes
i
resolved
to
say
that
i
had
forgotten
it
as
we
went
past
the
stables
big
adam
motioned
for
me
to
stop
and
raising
himself
up
beside
me
by
putting
his
foot
on
the
wheel
again
he
whispered
my
brothers
and
sisters
are
all
he
stepped
down
from
the
wheel
and
putting
the
whip
to
the
horses
i
soon
left
the
place
behind
me
i
saw
that
agnes
had
been
crying
for
her
eyes
were
red
and
swollen
but
i
pretended
not
to
notice
it
and
hoped
her
spirits
would
revive
as
we
neared
fairview
you
will
excuse
me
ned
she
said
after
we
had
driven
a
long
time
in
silence
if
i
have
neglected
you
but
i
have
not
been
myself
for
several
days
big
adam
talks
a
great
deal
and
i
saw
you
down
in
the
yard
with
him
a
long
while
you
should
not
believe
all
he
says
i
am
unhappy
on
my
own
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
in
reply
for
i
was
anxious
for
her
to
believe
that
i
thought
her
mother
was
not
at
home
or
something
of
that
sort
so
i
jerked
one
of
the
horses
roughly
and
said
whoa
as
if
the
animal
were
preparing
to
run
away
i
knew
she
was
distressed
that
i
knew
how
unhappy
she
was
at
home
and
was
trying
to
lay
the
blame
on
herself
as
she
did
in
everything
therefore
i
watched
the
dangerous
horse
very
intently
for
several
minutes
and
finally
got
down
to
walk
around
the
wagon
to
see
if
anything
was
wrong
after
i
had
pounded
the
tires
awhile
with
a
stone
although
they
were
new
i
climbed
back
into
my
seat
and
we
drove
on
again
the
people
of
fairview
have
been
very
kind
to
me
agnes
continued
not
minding
that
i
did
not
care
to
talk
on
the
subject
and
i
have
been
happier
there
than
here
although
it
is
very
ungrateful
in
me
and
a
poor
return
for
the
patient
way
in
which
they
bear
with
me
at
home
i
am
so
wicked
and
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
as
she
spoke
and
i
wondered
whether
it
was
wrong
to
tell
white
lies
for
i
was
sure
agnes
was
fibbing
in
defence
of
her
family
she
thought
about
the
matter
a
long
time
after
that
and
looked
at
me
narrowly
although
i
pretended
not
to
know
it
and
seemed
to
conclude
at
last
that
i
had
made
good
use
of
my
time
with
big
adam
and
that
she
must
depend
upon
the
charity
of
my
silence
any
way
she
said
no
more
upon
the
subject
and
we
rode
in
silence
for
several
miles
you
have
always
taken
a
great
interest
in
my
father
she
said
at
last
wiping
her
eyes
and
dismissing
the
unpleasant
subject
i
have
brought
you
his
picture
as
a
she
took
it
out
of
a
little
package
she
carried
and
gave
it
to
me
it
was
a
handsome
face
and
looked
very
much
as
i
had
imagined
except
that
it
was
i
put
it
away
carefully
and
she
said
my
life
would
have
been
very
different
had
he
lived
and
i
should
not
have
been
so
unkind
to
every
one
he
was
always
so
brave
and
good
that
i
should
have
striven
to
be
like
him
for
everybody
loved
him
but
he
is
dead
and
i
can
not
be
content
without
him
it
is
this
that
makes
me
fretful
and
unworthy
of
my
many
good
friends
oh
dear
i
am
going
to
she
did
cry
again
apologizing
for
it
in
a
way
that
reminded
me
of
her
uncle
and
i
sat
there
feeling
like
a
fool
while
she
was
giving
vent
to
her
grief
and
until
she
had
regained
her
once
more
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
see
him
buried
and
that
he
did
not
have
a
quiet
place
to
rest
agnes
continued
wiping
her
eyes
for
i
dream
at
night
of
his
ship
and
always
think
of
the
sea
as
forever
rolling
and
tossing
his
poor
body
about
refusing
it
rest
and
peace
often
in
the
wicked
waves
i
see
his
white
face
turned
imploringly
to
me
and
the
noises
of
the
night
i
torture
into
his
cries
to
me
for
help
if
i
knew
where
he
was
buried
and
could
sometimes
visit
his
grave
i
should
be
more
content
and
less
i
had
heard
a
song
called
when
the
sea
gives
up
its
dead
and
without
thinking
what
i
did
i
softly
hummed
it
when
he
came
home
at
the
time
i
saw
him
last
he
carried
me
about
in
his
great
strong
arms
along
the
beach
and
said
that
if
some
day
he
never
came
back
for
me
not
to
dislike
the
sea
for
it
had
been
his
friend
in
many
a
storm
and
had
rocked
him
to
sleep
almost
every
night
since
he
was
born
it
will
never
prove
treacherous
he
said
my
ship
may
but
never
the
sea
the
agnes
is
not
like
the
stout
girl
in
whose
honor
she
was
named
she
is
getting
old
and
should
she
founder
with
me
in
the
storms
and
go
down
never
feel
unkindly
toward
the
sea
it
has
been
my
friend
so
many
years
that
should
it
swallow
me
up
i
desire
you
to
think
that
i
deserved
he
went
away
soon
after
that
and
we
have
never
seen
him
although
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
again
she
bravely
wiped
them
away
i
am
sorry
for
you
i
made
bold
to
say
looking
at
her
pretty
face
i
wish
i
were
a
man
and
old
enough
i
would
marry
you
and
make
you
happy
in
spite
of
yourself
i
can
not
tell
you
how
much
i
desire
your
good
or
how
much
i
love
you
your
presence
at
our
house
has
made
us
a
different
family
my
mother
is
more
content
and
my
father
less
gloomy
and
surely
jo
and
i
know
more
since
you
came
i
love
you
because
you
are
good
and
pretty
and
i
think
you
are
prettier
than
i
have
ever
seen
you
before
if
i
were
a
little
older
i
would
fall
in
love
with
you
and
worry
you
a
great
deal
with
my
it
wouldn
t
worry
me
ned
she
answered
with
a
return
of
her
old
cheerfulness
i
should
like
it
but
i
thought
you
were
in
love
with
oh
i
am
of
course
as
a
boy
i
answered
but
i
mean
if
i
were
a
man
if
you
should
concentrate
the
love
you
distribute
in
fairview
on
one
man
i
should
like
to
be
the
man
that
s
what
i
mean
you
love
everybody
in
fairview
just
i
am
not
so
certain
of
that
she
replied
i
think
i
am
very
partial
to
you
who
is
most
gallant
and
thoughtful
to
me
of
all
my
pupils
why
you
are
of
course
and
i
love
you
best
of
any
of
them
when
i
get
to
be
an
old
woman
and
you
a
young
man
i
shall
show
my
love
for
you
by
selecting
you
a
wife
and
if
i
am
unable
to
find
you
a
very
good
one
you
shall
remain
single
as
i
intend
to
do
i
regard
you
as
my
best
friend
and
i
want
you
to
think
so
when
you
came
yesterday
i
wanted
to
run
down
and
kiss
you
but
i
could
not
leave
my
but
you
never
have
kissed
me
i
said
although
you
say
you
love
i
will
now
if
you
will
let
me
she
replied
and
putting
her
arms
round
me
she
kissed
me
as
innocently
as
if
i
had
been
a
child
i
was
very
much
abashed
but
thanked
her
as
for
any
other
favor
you
are
the
first
girl
that
ever
kissed
me
i
said
well
let
me
be
the
last
one
unless
i
should
want
to
kiss
you
again
but
we
are
in
sight
of
fairview
and
while
we
are
alone
i
want
to
tell
you
about
big
adam
his
father
is
an
outlaw
living
somewhere
in
the
great
west
and
although
he
occasionally
comes
to
smoky
hill
it
is
always
at
night
his
mother
is
a
rough
woman
who
smokes
and
drinks
and
his
brothers
and
sisters
are
very
bad
people
i
don
t
know
where
they
all
live
though
i
frequently
hear
of
them
but
never
anything
to
their
credit
it
is
said
that
his
mother
s
house
which
is
situated
in
a
deep
hollow
near
the
river
is
a
rendezvous
for
bad
men
and
frequently
it
is
raided
by
the
officers
looking
for
her
bold
husband
big
adam
is
the
only
honest
one
among
them
and
that
is
why
he
says
they
are
all
dead
but
even
he
talks
too
i
knew
she
wanted
me
to
believe
that
he
had
misrepresented
her
family
though
she
was
certain
he
had
not
therefore
i
only
said
that
fairview
church
looked
very
pretty
from
the
high
point
over
which
the
road
led
us
i
had
never
thought
so
before
but
the
country
surrounding
it
was
much
finer
than
the
smoky
hill
district
and
i
began
to
think
that
if
i
could
travel
more
i
might
grow
more
content
with
my
own
home
our
house
was
built
in
a
rather
low
place
and
i
noticed
with
surprise
what
i
had
not
had
opportunity
of
noticing
before
that
a
great
many
new
fields
were
being
opened
in
different
directions
fairview
was
quietly
and
rapidly
settling
up
anything
big
adam
may
have
said
to
you
agnes
said
as
we
were
nearing
the
house
is
to
be
private
between
you
and
i
readily
promised
though
i
had
been
thinking
but
a
moment
before
of
adding
largely
to
it
and
astonishing
jo
since
we
are
good
friends
we
must
have
our
secrets
and
this
is
our
first
one
you
may
tell
jo
that
i
kissed
i
blushed
because
she
had
divined
that
i
intended
to
tell
him
about
her
mother
but
comforted
myself
with
the
reflection
that
she
could
not
know
for
a
certainty
my
mother
was
waiting
for
us
and
the
place
was
so
quiet
and
pleasant
and
the
late
dinner
she
had
prepared
so
good
that
i
began
to
feel
like
a
very
favored
fellow
jo
and
the
man
of
the
house
were
away
somewhere
and
we
spent
the
afternoon
like
three
happy
children
suddenly
free
from
some
exacting
restraint
agnes
and
i
made
so
much
of
my
mother
that
i
remember
her
as
being
happier
on
that
day
than
any
other
and
when
i
think
of
her
now
so
long
after
i
am
glad
that
it
is
as
she
sat
in
her
easy
chair
between
us
that
afternoon
saying
little
but
looking
content
and
happy
chapter
jo
erring
makes
a
full
confession
inasmuch
as
that
young
man
continued
to
haul
stone
to
erring
s
ford
for
a
dam
and
would
talk
of
nothing
else
it
became
certain
in
course
of
time
that
jo
would
never
make
a
farmer
so
it
was
agreed
at
a
convention
attended
by
my
father
and
my
grandmother
that
he
should
be
apprenticed
for
two
years
to
damon
barker
of
the
establishment
on
bull
river
barker
had
suggested
it
i
believe
as
he
needed
some
one
to
assist
him
and
was
much
pleased
with
jo
besides
who
had
already
learned
to
help
him
in
many
ways
during
visits
to
the
place
these
visits
were
allowed
to
become
frequent
and
protracted
when
it
was
decided
that
he
should
be
sent
there
to
learn
milling
as
a
business
when
it
was
announced
to
jo
that
the
arrangement
had
been
made
it
was
one
sunday
afternoon
he
took
me
out
to
the
hayloft
of
the
stable
to
talk
about
it
i
am
to
be
given
a
chance
he
said
and
that
is
all
i
ask
i
intend
to
work
hard
and
at
the
end
of
two
years
i
shall
be
in
position
to
commence
my
mill
in
earnest
i
am
seventeen
years
old
now
i
shall
be
nineteen
then
and
by
the
time
i
am
erring
s
mill
will
be
in
operation
it
seems
a
very
long
time
to
wait
and
a
big
undertaking
but
it
is
the
best
i
can
he
was
lying
on
his
back
looking
through
the
holes
in
the
roof
at
the
sky
and
i
thought
more
than
ever
that
he
was
brave
and
capable
and
that
he
had
always
been
treated
unjustly
in
fairview
i
was
thinking
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
before
that
i
should
be
very
lonesome
without
him
and
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
of
it
too
for
he
said
but
it
is
only
for
three
or
four
years
ned
as
if
we
had
been
talking
instead
of
thinking
of
the
separation
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
i
may
be
able
to
make
you
my
assistant
or
better
still
my
partner
we
have
had
a
very
wretched
time
of
it
in
the
past
but
there
may
be
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
in
store
for
us
in
the
future
if
we
work
as
hard
as
we
expect
i
believe
everything
will
come
out
right
yet
they
say
you
are
old
of
your
age
i
am
not
old
of
my
age
on
the
other
hand
i
am
very
dull
but
i
shall
be
a
man
then
and
in
any
event
one
need
not
be
old
to
be
useful
people
here
think
differently
but
it
is
because
the
community
is
slow
and
ignorant
here
the
man
who
owns
a
piece
of
land
and
a
team
is
supposed
to
have
accomplished
all
that
it
is
possible
for
a
man
to
accomplish
but
barker
told
me
once
that
there
are
men
who
make
a
fairview
fortune
in
a
day
i
don
t
want
to
be
like
the
people
here
for
none
of
them
are
contented
or
happy
but
i
intend
to
be
like
the
people
who
i
am
certain
live
in
other
countries
i
can
not
believe
but
that
there
is
a
better
way
to
live
than
that
accepted
at
fairview
and
that
somewhere
i
don
t
know
where
for
i
have
never
travelled
happy
homes
may
be
found
and
contented
people
where
parents
love
their
children
and
where
people
love
their
homes
therefore
i
shall
begin
differently
and
work
harder
and
to
more
purpose
than
the
people
here
have
done
to
the
end
that
i
may
be
a
different
heaven
help
you
jo
in
that
there
never
was
a
happy
man
in
fairview
and
i
hoped
with
all
my
heart
that
jo
might
become
one
as
he
deserved
i
have
always
been
lonely
and
friendless
he
went
on
they
never
wanted
me
at
home
your
father
never
seemed
satisfied
with
me
here
and
excepting
you
i
have
never
had
a
friend
in
my
life
i
care
nothing
for
my
family
i
fear
it
is
sad
depravity
but
i
can
not
help
it
they
have
never
treated
me
well
and
care
nothing
for
me
and
i
can
not
feel
kindly
toward
them
for
no
one
can
love
without
a
reason
you
do
not
fall
in
love
with
the
woman
that
wounds
you
but
you
do
fall
in
love
with
the
woman
that
is
kind
to
you
i
think
a
great
deal
of
you
but
you
gave
me
reason
for
it
by
thinking
a
great
deal
of
me
i
never
knew
until
i
thought
of
going
away
how
much
i
did
think
of
he
talked
so
pitifully
of
the
neglect
to
which
he
had
always
been
subject
and
i
knew
so
well
it
was
true
that
i
could
only
reply
through
my
tears
that
he
was
my
best
friend
and
that
i
thought
more
of
him
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
while
they
all
occasionally
have
kind
words
for
others
they
never
have
a
word
of
encouragement
for
me
but
i
am
glad
that
i
did
not
deserve
it
i
should
hate
to
feel
that
i
deserve
all
the
unkindness
i
have
received
here
and
that
i
was
as
idle
and
unworthy
as
they
seem
to
think
me
but
i
never
did
and
i
hope
you
honestly
think
so
you
are
the
only
one
among
them
who
was
fair
and
just
and
after
i
have
gone
away
i
shall
only
have
you
to
remember
pleasantly
i
am
glad
that
i
am
going
to
a
place
at
last
where
i
shall
be
welcome
and
i
thought
that
afternoon
that
all
of
them
were
unjust
to
jo
and
steadily
refused
to
give
him
the
credit
he
deserved
i
think
so
now
a
great
many
years
after
with
a
maturer
mind
and
greater
experience
we
have
been
very
ignorant
here
you
and
it
was
very
disgraceful
but
very
true
your
father
is
wise
enough
but
as
he
takes
no
pains
to
impart
it
to
others
we
have
had
little
benefit
of
his
wisdom
for
the
next
two
years
i
shall
live
with
a
man
who
is
educated
and
who
will
willingly
teach
me
and
i
intend
to
tax
his
patience
with
my
studies
barker
is
not
only
learned
but
he
is
courteous
and
i
can
learn
something
of
polite
manners
he
bows
like
a
king
only
a
very
few
men
are
able
to
make
a
really
good
bow
i
asked
him
once
where
he
learned
it
but
he
only
laughed
and
said
everyone
ought
to
be
polite
without
learning
it
anywhere
it
made
me
ashamed
for
politeness
never
came
natural
with
me
perhaps
i
am
so
awkward
because
i
do
not
come
of
a
good
certainly
his
father
and
mother
were
not
polite
to
each
other
or
to
their
son
i
have
made
many
terrible
mistakes
from
not
knowing
any
better
and
they
will
humiliate
me
all
my
life
once
i
went
with
your
mother
to
call
at
the
new
minister
s
this
is
in
the
strictest
confidence
and
never
to
be
repeated
and
i
did
a
thing
so
dreadful
that
i
am
blushing
now
in
thinking
of
it
i
wore
a
little
cap
i
have
since
burned
it
and
although
i
know
now
it
was
hideously
ugly
i
thought
then
that
it
made
me
very
handsome
i
bought
it
of
a
boy
who
had
lived
in
town
and
i
had
seen
town
boys
wear
them
so
i
shuffled
into
their
parlor
wearing
your
father
s
boots
with
a
pair
of
his
pantaloons
tucked
into
their
tops
and
the
cap
on
my
head
the
shepherds
are
very
people
and
after
i
had
stumbled
across
the
room
and
fallen
into
a
chair
all
in
a
heap
mateel
how
pretty
she
was
that
night
and
how
pretty
she
always
is
came
over
to
me
and
asked
to
lay
away
my
cap
i
thought
it
very
amiable
in
me
not
to
trouble
her
so
i
refused
to
give
it
up
in
fact
i
said
no
i
thank
you
i
am
very
comfortable
as
i
am
and
i
sat
the
entire
evening
through
with
that
cap
on
my
head
nobody
had
ever
told
me
to
remove
my
cap
in
the
presence
of
ladies
and
being
of
a
poor
family
i
did
not
know
it
without
being
told
i
know
better
now
for
barker
laughed
at
me
and
explained
why
it
was
under
other
circumstances
i
should
have
laughed
but
jo
was
so
serious
that
i
did
not
think
of
it
they
asked
me
to
sing
simply
to
be
polite
i
am
now
certain
your
mother
did
not
say
for
me
not
to
so
i
stumbled
over
to
the
melodeon
and
sang
nine
verses
of
the
glorious
eighth
of
april
in
a
voice
so
loud
that
the
windows
rattled
they
were
all
blushing
for
me
but
i
never
once
suspected
it
i
had
heard
your
father
sing
the
same
song
a
hundred
times
and
i
supposed
it
was
all
right
is
that
all
they
asked
when
i
had
finished
i
regretted
that
it
was
thinking
they
were
entertained
and
i
came
very
near
singing
it
all
over
again
i
told
barker
about
it
and
he
gave
me
lessons
in
propriety
an
entire
afternoon
i
felt
coming
home
that
i
had
in
some
way
committed
an
indiscretion
but
i
could
not
tell
exactly
what
it
was
until
barker
pointed
it
out
he
suggested
that
i
write
an
apology
and
as
i
have
it
here
i
will
read
it
if
you
care
to
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
neatly
written
note
and
after
i
had
signified
an
anxiety
to
know
its
contents
he
read
miss
shepherd
i
feel
that
my
remarkable
conduct
at
your
house
a
few
weeks
ago
needs
an
explanation
and
i
write
this
to
confess
candidly
that
it
was
caused
by
my
ignorance
and
should
not
be
regarded
as
a
lack
of
respect
to
you
or
your
father
and
mother
it
is
because
i
have
lived
in
the
backwoods
all
my
life
and
because
no
one
ever
took
sufficient
interest
in
me
to
say
that
i
should
have
removed
my
cap
from
my
head
but
if
i
am
forgiven
and
allowed
to
visit
you
again
i
will
be
careful
that
there
is
no
repetition
of
the
offence
with
reference
to
the
tiresome
song
i
sang
i
have
only
the
same
plea
i
did
not
know
any
better
i
know
now
that
i
can
not
sing
i
can
only
bellow
when
i
tell
you
that
the
noise
i
made
is
regarded
as
music
in
fairview
you
will
realize
more
vividly
than
i
can
tell
you
that
the
community
where
i
have
grown
up
is
not
cultured
i
am
distressed
that
i
acted
as
i
did
and
hope
you
will
accept
this
humble
apology
please
express
my
regrets
to
your
father
and
mother
and
regard
this
note
as
in
confidence
very
truly
yours
jo
after
folding
the
note
carefully
and
putting
it
back
in
the
envelope
from
which
he
had
taken
it
he
inquired
what
do
you
think
of
it
knowing
barker
had
suggested
it
and
probably
dictated
the
words
i
said
it
was
neat
and
appropriate
and
the
best
thing
that
could
be
done
under
the
circumstances
for
i
had
no
opinion
of
my
own
on
the
delicate
question
they
are
the
only
people
i
have
ever
known
if
i
except
barker
and
agnes
jo
said
after
a
long
silence
and
though
i
should
like
to
visit
them
often
i
am
afraid
i
can
never
get
the
courage
to
go
there
again
they
have
undoubtedly
a
poor
opinion
of
me
for
they
can
never
understand
how
a
young
man
of
my
age
could
be
so
uncouth
but
other
families
of
good
manners
will
perhaps
come
to
fairview
and
i
intend
to
take
lessons
from
barker
and
cultivate
their
acquaintance
i
have
great
respect
for
polished
people
but
i
never
admired
a
quality
in
others
that
i
did
not
lack
it
myself
therefore
i
fear
i
shall
make
but
poor
progress
but
this
is
a
small
matter
compared
with
learning
the
mill
business
perhaps
i
had
better
renounce
society
until
i
am
the
best
miller
on
the
it
won
t
be
long
jo
i
answered
and
feeling
that
what
i
said
was
true
barker
says
he
can
teach
me
all
he
knows
in
half
a
year
after
that
i
will
experiment
for
myself
and
perhaps
i
may
be
able
to
discover
something
which
will
repay
him
for
his
kindness
to
me
if
i
am
apt
at
anything
which
i
sometimes
doubt
it
is
with
machinery
and
there
is
so
little
of
it
at
barker
s
that
i
hope
i
will
be
able
to
master
it
all
in
a
few
months
i
am
familiar
with
all
of
it
now
and
i
shall
work
very
hard
until
i
can
take
it
all
apart
and
put
it
together
again
better
than
it
was
we
were
both
quiet
a
long
while
busy
with
our
own
thoughts
until
jo
said
i
am
going
away
when
are
you
coming
to
see
me
i
had
it
in
my
mind
to
say
on
tuesday
but
as
that
would
be
the
next
day
after
his
departure
and
impossible
i
said
instead
that
i
would
come
as
soon
as
i
could
certainly
not
later
than
that
day
a
week
i
shall
be
very
busy
and
lonely
too
and
i
hope
you
will
come
often
you
haven
t
been
out
of
my
sight
more
than
a
day
at
a
time
since
you
were
born
and
you
are
the
only
brother
i
ever
had
i
don
t
intend
to
come
here
much
and
as
you
enjoy
visiting
at
barker
s
we
will
arrange
it
in
that
way
they
will
perhaps
tolerate
me
here
once
in
a
long
while
to
see
if
i
have
cut
off
any
of
my
fingers
in
the
but
for
no
other
reason
i
have
been
an
intruder
ever
since
i
can
remember
and
lonely
and
i
felt
that
this
was
true
unjust
and
cruel
as
it
was
and
could
say
nothing
although
jo
spoke
of
it
in
a
husky
voice
as
though
it
would
be
a
relief
to
cry
if
it
were
not
unmanly
your
mother
has
been
kinder
to
me
than
any
of
them
if
i
except
agnes
who
is
the
friend
of
every
one
but
her
health
has
always
been
poor
and
she
has
a
great
deal
to
do
she
often
comes
into
my
room
at
night
if
she
suspects
that
i
am
not
well
and
asks
if
she
can
do
anything
for
me
but
i
know
she
is
always
tired
and
i
feel
more
like
helping
her
than
allowing
her
to
help
me
i
shall
always
remember
her
gratefully
for
it
and
believe
that
were
she
less
unhappy
herself
we
would
have
been
a
different
the
mention
of
agnes
reminded
me
that
she
had
presented
me
with
her
father
s
picture
and
taking
it
from
my
pocket
i
gave
it
to
jo
but
he
did
not
care
to
look
at
it
then
and
said
he
would
take
it
and
give
it
back
at
some
future
time
your
father
is
never
unkind
to
her
he
continued
determined
to
talk
on
that
subject
but
they
are
more
like
strangers
than
man
and
wife
they
have
not
occupied
the
same
room
for
years
therefore
she
is
always
striving
to
reconcile
him
knowing
that
he
is
discontented
and
dissatisfied
though
i
can
not
see
that
she
is
to
blame
for
it
and
as
a
true
woman
and
she
is
one
if
ever
one
lived
this
makes
her
very
unhappy
i
know
less
of
your
father
every
day
and
i
fear
that
something
unfortunate
will
come
of
his
discontent
i
hope
it
will
not
turn
out
that
religion
is
a
bad
thing
for
him
as
barker
predicts
i
never
mentioned
it
to
you
before
but
the
night
you
were
away
your
mother
came
softly
into
our
room
and
asked
why
i
had
gone
to
bed
so
early
i
said
i
was
unusually
tired
and
that
i
had
to
get
up
very
early
in
the
morning
nothing
more
than
that
she
remained
there
for
two
hours
as
if
anxious
to
be
with
me
and
there
was
enough
light
in
the
room
for
me
to
see
that
tears
were
in
her
eyes
and
that
she
was
in
great
distress
since
six
o
clock
she
said
to
me
my
husband
has
not
changed
his
position
or
spoken
it
is
his
habit
every
night
he
is
always
thinking
and
always
silent
and
discontented
if
i
knew
what
his
trouble
is
perhaps
i
could
help
him
as
i
am
anxious
to
do
but
he
will
not
tell
me
though
i
do
not
ask
him
for
i
am
afraid
he
thinks
all
day
at
his
work
you
have
told
me
and
i
believe
he
thinks
all
night
for
i
have
known
him
to
get
up
at
midnight
and
walk
the
floor
until
day
he
is
always
considerate
of
me
and
never
speaks
unkindly
but
he
has
never
been
my
husband
except
in
name
and
the
fear
that
i
have
done
something
to
offend
him
makes
me
very
wretched
for
i
have
always
tried
to
be
all
that
he
desired
there
is
something
dreadfully
portentous
in
this
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
but
i
am
certain
that
it
will
finally
make
us
very
miserable
i
have
never
spoken
of
this
before
i
never
intend
to
speak
of
it
again
and
i
only
mention
it
now
because
i
feel
that
i
can
live
but
a
few
years
longer
and
i
must
speak
of
it
to
make
clear
a
request
i
have
to
make
ned
is
out
of
the
house
and
farther
away
from
me
then
ever
before
since
he
was
born
after
you
two
have
gone
to
sleep
here
in
this
room
i
always
come
in
to
kiss
him
and
jo
i
frequently
kiss
you
too
since
he
was
a
baby
in
my
arms
i
have
never
kissed
him
except
when
he
was
asleep
because
his
father
seemed
to
dislike
such
exhibitions
of
affection
but
i
come
to
his
bed
every
night
and
kiss
him
after
he
has
gone
to
she
cried
softly
to
herself
awhile
and
remained
so
quiet
that
i
could
hear
her
tears
fall
in
little
plashes
to
the
floor
the
request
that
i
have
to
make
is
that
after
i
am
dead
you
will
tell
him
of
this
i
have
made
a
mistake
in
raising
him
and
i
know
i
should
have
cultivated
his
affection
for
me
after
he
put
on
boots
and
mittens
and
went
out
with
his
father
to
work
but
i
was
afraid
for
none
of
that
is
allowed
in
this
house
as
you
know
i
do
not
feel
free
to
be
kind
to
you
jo
or
show
you
any
attention
for
fear
my
husband
will
regard
it
as
an
interference
with
his
discipline
which
excuse
he
has
used
to
separate
me
from
my
boy
i
know
he
regards
me
as
like
his
father
but
i
am
not
i
love
him
as
every
mother
loves
her
only
child
but
he
does
not
understand
it
and
lately
he
avoids
me
whenever
he
can
you
won
t
be
here
long
damon
barker
wants
you
to
live
at
the
mill
and
you
won
t
come
back
very
often
for
you
have
no
reason
to
therefore
i
ask
you
now
that
i
have
opportunity
to
tell
ned
that
i
have
always
loved
him
as
a
mother
should
and
that
i
was
indifferent
to
him
because
his
father
told
me
to
be
and
said
it
was
for
the
best
he
is
getting
to
be
quite
a
boy
now
and
when
he
comes
home
tired
and
i
know
he
thinks
we
are
unjust
to
make
him
work
so
hard
but
tell
him
jo
that
it
is
his
father
who
did
it
and
that
i
always
protested
against
it
i
want
you
to
take
good
care
of
him
after
i
am
dead
and
i
believe
you
will
for
i
can
see
you
are
very
fond
of
him
as
he
is
of
you
i
believe
you
will
both
become
good
and
intelligent
men
some
day
men
who
will
love
your
wives
and
children
instead
of
treating
them
as
they
are
treated
in
fairview
and
i
want
you
to
believe
when
you
are
grown
up
that
i
raised
you
as
best
i
could
you
have
lived
here
nearly
as
long
as
i
have
and
this
is
your
home
as
well
as
ned
s
and
if
you
have
not
been
contented
and
happy
it
was
not
because
i
did
not
love
you
both
i
trusted
too
much
to
another
s
judgment
and
was
afraid
to
do
what
i
felt
i
should
have
done
when
you
become
men
you
will
think
a
great
deal
of
this
period
in
your
lives
for
it
is
indelibly
stamped
on
your
memory
by
its
discomforts
but
i
hope
you
will
remember
that
i
was
sick
a
great
deal
and
could
not
pay
you
the
attention
i
wanted
to
good
after
wiping
away
our
tears
for
the
story
affected
us
both
to
that
extent
we
resolved
over
and
over
again
to
be
more
considerate
of
her
in
the
future
as
we
now
better
understood
her
strange
disposition
toward
us
i
do
not
know
that
we
had
ever
been
more
inconsiderate
than
other
boys
but
we
all
seemed
to
be
waiting
at
our
house
for
an
opportunity
to
get
away
and
find
more
pleasant
companions
which
made
us
unthoughtful
of
each
other
and
i
think
it
was
to
this
she
referred
in
her
talk
with
jo
when
we
went
into
the
house
again
my
father
was
sitting
in
his
accustomed
place
thinking
he
had
not
changed
his
position
since
we
went
out
of
the
room
an
hour
or
two
before
and
i
think
he
regretted
he
could
not
go
out
into
the
fields
and
lose
his
thoughts
in
working
he
looked
up
when
we
came
in
and
addressing
himself
to
jo
said
are
you
glad
to
go
yes
sir
jo
promptly
responded
this
did
not
seem
to
surprise
him
and
he
kept
on
thinking
as
though
he
might
have
known
it
without
asking
i
have
no
doubt
you
think
i
have
been
a
hard
master
my
father
said
i
have
been
but
because
i
believed
it
was
best
to
teach
boys
to
work
before
you
reach
my
age
you
will
know
i
was
right
and
that
the
course
i
have
pursued
with
you
was
the
best
one
but
to
show
you
that
i
am
anxious
for
your
success
i
offer
to
help
you
start
the
mill
at
the
ford
if
you
apply
yourself
at
barker
s
and
give
me
reason
to
believe
that
you
are
worthy
and
capable
whatever
else
you
may
think
of
me
you
know
i
keep
my
word
in
everything
bear
this
in
mind
during
the
next
two
when
he
began
thinking
again
i
thought
it
was
that
although
he
always
did
that
which
was
for
the
best
he
was
blamed
for
it
and
hated
i
have
no
advice
to
give
you
because
you
would
take
nothing
kindly
from
me
and
because
i
seldom
give
it
to
anyone
every
man
must
advise
himself
after
he
is
convinced
what
course
he
had
better
pursue
the
world
is
full
of
people
giving
good
advice
to
others
but
i
have
thought
we
should
all
be
better
off
if
we
would
advise
ourselves
more
and
others
less
if
i
could
take
the
good
advice
i
am
capable
of
giving
i
should
have
no
occasion
to
accept
it
from
others
the
same
is
true
in
your
case
advise
yourself
and
see
that
your
advice
is
good
i
believe
you
will
succeed
over
there
and
i
earnestly
hope
you
will
no
more
need
be
said
on
the
when
he
began
his
thinking
again
i
thought
it
was
to
wonder
why
jo
should
not
feel
grateful
to
him
now
instead
of
in
the
future
he
was
sure
he
would
then
after
he
was
dead
and
in
need
of
no
evidence
that
the
course
he
had
pursued
was
right
that
night
i
resolved
to
remain
awake
to
see
if
my
mother
came
to
me
in
my
room
she
did
not
disappoint
me
and
coming
in
quietly
sat
down
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
where
she
remained
in
deep
study
a
long
while
i
could
not
see
her
face
but
i
was
certain
it
was
thoughtful
and
sad
and
that
she
felt
ill
at
ease
and
wretched
the
moon
was
shining
outside
and
she
pulled
aside
the
curtain
to
look
at
us
at
last
she
got
up
and
bending
over
the
bed
kissed
me
tenderly
i
threw
my
arms
about
her
neck
and
said
mother
she
fell
on
her
knees
beside
the
bed
and
sobbed
in
such
distress
that
my
father
heard
her
and
came
in
hurriedly
from
the
other
room
to
inquire
what
was
the
matter
but
only
her
sobbing
answered
him
and
speaking
to
her
tenderly
as
if
divining
what
had
affected
her
he
led
her
away
with
his
arm
around
her
your
father
has
been
thinking
again
jo
said
as
the
door
closed
upon
them
i
was
awake
too
ned
never
keep
anything
from
me
chapter
xi
with
reference
to
a
man
who
was
sent
west
to
grow
up
with
the
country
or
get
killed
a
few
months
after
the
shepherds
came
to
fairview
and
after
they
had
become
fairly
settled
in
their
new
home
they
lived
beyond
erring
s
ford
and
on
the
other
edge
of
the
timber
which
began
there
a
fellow
arrived
who
was
thoroughly
disliked
from
the
moment
of
his
appearance
because
he
had
an
insolent
manner
an
insolent
walk
and
was
insolent
in
everything
he
did
to
say
nothing
of
his
flashy
dress
and
a
general
air
of
impudence
his
name
was
clinton
bragg
and
as
he
appeared
there
in
company
with
the
shepherds
it
was
soon
understood
that
in
the
country
from
which
they
came
their
families
had
been
intimate
and
friends
i
think
he
only
consented
to
visit
fairview
church
on
the
sunday
of
his
first
appearance
as
a
geologist
consents
to
enter
a
dirty
pit
in
the
earth
for
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
curious
specimens
and
formations
and
he
regarded
the
people
he
saw
whom
he
looked
at
with
a
cool
stare
as
a
herd
of
peculiar
beasts
or
a
drove
of
something
shepherd
had
applied
himself
with
great
industry
to
agriculture
although
it
was
not
expected
of
him
as
his
salary
was
sufficient
for
his
support
but
a
member
of
the
congregation
had
given
him
the
free
use
of
a
piece
of
land
and
he
devoted
certain
hours
of
each
day
to
cultivating
it
his
appetite
and
strength
both
of
which
had
deserted
him
years
before
had
returned
from
this
exercise
and
he
progressed
so
well
that
it
was
known
that
after
he
had
remained
at
fairview
as
long
as
the
rules
of
the
church
allowed
he
would
give
up
preaching
altogether
and
follow
agriculture
instead
the
people
thought
a
great
deal
of
him
as
he
was
kind
and
gentle
and
preached
a
religion
less
rigorous
than
my
father
s
had
been
and
they
were
useful
to
him
in
so
many
ways
that
he
was
greatly
pleased
with
the
people
and
the
community
for
i
think
he
had
never
lived
in
a
place
before
where
he
was
of
so
much
importance
therefore
it
was
plain
that
he
was
annoyed
by
bragg
s
impertinence
and
i
thought
mateel
and
her
mother
shared
the
feeling
he
sat
with
them
during
the
services
but
went
out
in
a
rude
way
immediately
after
the
preaching
was
over
giving
the
people
to
understand
as
plainly
as
he
could
that
he
thought
them
inferior
through
the
open
door
from
where
i
sat
i
could
see
him
standing
out
at
the
gate
like
an
evil
spirit
and
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
fairview
was
progressing
for
all
sorts
of
people
were
coming
in
i
had
never
seen
a
man
like
this
one
before
for
we
knew
by
his
manner
that
he
lived
without
work
when
the
people
came
out
he
walked
ahead
of
them
as
though
fearing
he
would
be
trampled
upon
and
seemed
anxious
to
get
away
to
this
end
he
unhitched
the
minister
s
horses
and
after
turning
their
heads
homeward
sat
holding
them
impatiently
until
the
family
concluded
their
greetings
with
those
who
crowded
around
them
amusing
himself
by
chewing
bits
of
hay
and
spitting
them
out
spitefully
when
it
was
announced
that
the
family
would
spend
the
time
at
our
house
until
the
evening
service
he
was
evidently
displeased
as
he
had
probably
thought
to
pass
a
pleasant
afternoon
at
the
home
of
the
shepherds
in
abusing
the
fairview
people
but
though
i
thought
at
first
he
would
get
out
of
the
wagon
and
walk
back
to
town
he
seemed
to
reconsider
finally
as
if
it
was
worth
his
time
to
see
how
the
animals
lived
all
this
i
imagined
while
looking
at
him
for
he
said
nothing
and
when
i
rode
in
the
seat
in
front
of
him
which
i
did
at
the
invitation
of
mateel
i
was
certain
he
was
frowning
all
the
way
and
thinking
of
me
as
a
fine
specimen
for
a
museum
his
presence
chilled
me
as
it
did
all
the
others
and
i
said
nothing
during
the
ride
fearing
he
would
snap
my
head
off
i
felt
too
that
though
the
others
disliked
him
they
were
afraid
of
his
tongue
should
he
find
occasion
to
use
it
and
i
drove
as
rapidly
as
i
could
to
get
rid
of
him
when
he
was
introduced
to
agnes
he
stared
at
her
with
cold
surprise
as
he
would
look
at
a
particular
animal
in
a
flock
driven
up
for
his
inspection
should
one
of
them
prove
finer
than
he
had
expected
and
agnes
turned
and
left
the
room
mateel
soon
followed
her
and
i
thought
that
she
went
out
to
apologize
for
her
rude
acquaintance
they
both
remained
away
until
dinner
was
ready
and
i
found
that
they
were
helping
my
mother
who
was
greatly
pleased
indeed
they
all
deserted
bragg
leaving
him
alone
in
the
best
room
a
greater
part
of
the
time
my
father
and
shepherd
finding
it
convenient
to
examine
a
lot
of
young
trees
lately
planted
in
the
orchard
my
grandmother
was
there
that
day
and
finding
that
they
were
all
afraid
of
bragg
she
went
in
to
keep
him
company
and
give
him
to
understand
that
she
was
too
old
a
bird
to
be
frightened
by
such
a
scarecrow
after
regarding
him
carefully
over
her
spectacles
first
wiping
the
glasses
as
though
that
would
help
her
in
taking
his
measure
she
called
me
in
and
kept
up
an
incessant
rattle
of
compliments
for
the
splendid
people
of
fairview
frequently
denouncing
the
ignorant
upstarts
who
did
not
like
them
but
bragg
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
to
her
and
kept
looking
out
of
the
window
first
at
the
church
and
then
at
the
fields
as
though
he
regretted
he
could
not
set
them
on
fire
by
holding
his
eyes
on
them
like
a
at
dinner
my
grandmother
sat
next
to
him
and
imposed
on
him
by
crowding
and
setting
everything
passed
to
her
as
far
away
as
possible
which
affronts
he
pretended
not
to
notice
although
the
others
were
very
at
the
table
he
remained
indifferent
to
everything
eating
whatever
was
offered
as
though
he
was
surprised
to
get
it
in
such
an
place
i
had
not
yet
heard
him
speak
and
began
to
wonder
how
it
would
sound
should
he
finally
consent
to
favor
us
with
a
word
the
good
humor
of
the
others
was
probably
to
show
bragg
that
his
was
of
no
consequence
and
that
he
was
welcome
to
his
mood
for
i
had
never
heard
so
much
laughter
in
that
house
before
i
was
particularly
proud
of
agnes
for
the
many
kind
things
she
managed
to
say
of
fairview
though
apparently
without
reference
to
bragg
she
was
superior
to
any
of
them
and
i
could
not
help
thinking
it
was
to
the
credit
of
the
country
that
she
had
lived
there
contentedly
before
they
came
although
the
dinner
to
which
he
sat
down
was
better
than
he
expected
and
the
people
offering
to
entertain
him
more
intelligent
he
could
not
conceal
his
occasional
surprise
he
would
not
admit
it
and
maintained
his
insolent
silence
when
he
went
back
into
the
best
room
nobody
followed
and
he
remained
there
undisturbed
except
occasionally
by
my
grandmother
who
dashed
in
at
intervals
to
turn
up
her
nose
i
learned
somehow
that
bragg
was
the
spoiled
son
of
a
family
and
that
his
father
after
spending
great
amounts
of
money
on
his
education
had
sent
him
west
to
grow
up
with
the
country
or
get
killed
it
was
evident
that
he
was
dissipated
he
gave
no
particular
evidence
of
it
but
i
supposed
that
must
be
the
matter
with
him
and
i
remember
thinking
that
the
miller
s
sister
would
be
glad
to
hear
of
his
arrival
as
it
would
give
her
opportunity
to
save
him
i
heard
shepherd
say
to
my
father
that
he
was
a
civil
engineer
and
would
make
that
his
business
in
twin
mounds
if
he
concluded
to
do
anything
at
all
which
was
not
decided
as
his
father
was
rich
and
would
cheerfully
supply
him
with
all
he
needed
he
is
disagreeable
to
me
and
to
my
family
he
added
but
i
was
a
boy
with
his
father
and
have
known
clinton
ever
since
he
was
born
he
has
been
headstrong
and
wilful
all
his
life
i
sincerely
hope
his
residence
here
will
do
him
good
i
don
t
know
what
his
habits
are
but
i
do
know
that
he
has
always
been
a
source
of
worry
and
trouble
at
home
at
school
everywhere
i
think
if
there
is
anything
in
him
it
will
develop
here
for
i
am
unable
to
understand
how
any
man
can
remain
idle
in
a
country
where
there
is
so
much
room
for
action
he
intends
to
open
an
office
in
town
he
says
and
if
he
is
competent
and
industrious
there
is
really
no
reason
why
he
should
not
live
to
make
his
father
proud
of
him
i
believe
his
mother
regards
him
as
the
most
wonderful
young
man
in
the
world
as
he
my
father
did
not
reply
but
i
am
sure
he
was
thinking
that
bragg
was
a
very
good
example
of
his
doctrine
that
an
idle
boy
invariably
grew
up
into
an
idle
and
disagreeable
man
he
is
an
only
son
shepherd
continued
and
will
one
day
come
into
possession
of
a
considerable
property
i
don
t
know
how
much
for
i
have
a
poor
head
for
such
calculations
but
i
should
say
it
will
be
sufficient
to
make
him
independent
for
the
remainder
of
his
life
this
has
been
his
misfortune
had
he
been
poor
i
think
he
would
have
been
a
better
boy
but
as
it
is
he
acts
as
his
sullen
temper
barker
had
told
jo
and
me
so
much
of
rich
people
that
i
greatly
admired
them
but
i
could
not
believe
that
bragg
was
a
fair
representative
of
the
class
and
i
learned
afterwards
that
he
was
hated
at
school
and
at
home
for
his
meanness
which
was
the
only
quality
he
cultivated
while
i
was
looking
at
him
and
thinking
i
would
get
jo
to
knock
him
down
some
day
mateel
and
agnes
came
around
the
house
with
damon
barker
who
had
evidently
just
arrived
he
had
never
met
either
of
them
before
but
on
encountering
them
introduced
himself
with
the
easy
grace
for
which
he
was
noted
both
had
heard
of
him
and
seemed
pleased
to
see
him
for
they
sat
down
on
each
side
of
him
on
a
rough
seat
under
an
i
went
out
to
them
at
once
and
he
spoke
to
me
in
such
a
considerate
way
that
i
was
sure
it
would
be
noticed
that
he
was
my
particular
friend
which
i
regarded
as
a
circumstance
very
much
in
my
favor
he
did
not
treat
me
as
a
boy
as
the
others
did
but
listened
kindly
when
i
was
talking
instead
of
waving
me
to
silence
with
his
hand
and
altogether
acted
as
though
i
was
worthy
of
his
respect
and
friendship
we
all
inquired
about
jo
who
had
been
away
several
weeks
and
he
replied
so
favorably
that
he
took
another
step
forward
in
my
good
opinion
jo
was
already
the
best
assistant
he
had
ever
had
he
said
and
was
certain
to
become
a
remarkable
man
i
have
a
few
books
about
the
house
barker
said
jo
devours
them
and
keeps
me
up
far
into
every
night
answering
questions
next
to
his
ambition
to
learn
all
there
is
about
the
mill
he
is
ambitious
to
know
all
there
is
in
the
books
i
think
he
will
succeed
in
both
particulars
i
was
not
mistaken
in
my
estimate
of
we
were
all
pleased
to
hear
him
say
this
and
though
not
intending
it
mateel
let
it
be
known
that
she
was
greatly
interested
in
jo
i
hoped
barker
would
notice
it
and
tell
him
for
it
would
be
a
pleasure
for
him
to
know
it
a
boy
apprenticed
on
a
farm
has
very
little
opportunity
to
learn
anything
i
wonder
that
he
knows
as
much
as
he
does
but
he
is
progressive
and
manly
and
i
am
very
much
mistaken
if
his
advancement
is
not
very
rapid
from
now
on
he
wants
to
know
about
everything
and
i
really
believe
he
could
run
the
mill
very
well
without
me
now
he
was
familiar
with
every
part
of
it
before
he
came
there
to
live
and
i
suppose
he
is
busy
taking
the
machinery
apart
to
look
at
it
since
i
am
not
there
to
answer
his
questions
regarding
the
contents
of
the
barker
seemed
to
understand
that
jo
had
never
been
appreciated
in
fairview
and
was
determined
that
the
people
should
know
he
was
very
favorably
impressed
with
him
i
thought
it
was
very
kind
of
him
to
come
so
far
to
defend
jo
a
young
man
ready
to
take
advantage
of
every
opportunity
is
rare
enough
to
be
remarkable
barker
continued
observing
mateel
very
closely
they
usually
have
to
be
driven
to
it
and
encouraged
to
keep
at
it
by
all
sorts
of
stratagems
but
jo
only
asks
opportunity
and
goes
at
his
work
with
an
energy
i
greatly
admire
i
have
known
hundreds
of
men
who
knew
less
at
middle
age
than
jo
knows
at
seventeen
and
who
were
not
his
equals
in
whatever
he
attempts
this
seems
to
have
been
against
him
here
but
it
will
be
to
his
advantage
in
his
new
place
but
i
believe
i
have
not
yet
asked
how
you
liked
fairview
he
abruptly
concluded
addressing
mateel
she
replied
very
much
as
a
polite
woman
should
that
while
it
was
not
possible
that
she
could
positively
say
on
so
short
an
acquaintance
she
believed
she
would
become
entirely
content
with
it
in
time
i
have
lived
here
contentedly
enough
a
good
many
years
barker
replied
with
few
acquaintances
and
fewer
friends
the
country
is
very
fair
i
know
little
enough
of
the
people
but
no
one
is
crowded
here
there
is
room
enough
for
everybody
and
there
are
splendid
opportunities
to
be
let
alone
there
is
a
good
deal
in
in
her
dependent
uncertain
way
mateel
looked
as
though
it
were
possible
to
be
let
alone
too
much
although
she
said
nothing
i
take
it
that
people
do
not
come
west
for
society
but
rather
because
there
are
more
acres
than
people
in
this
direction
barker
said
i
have
been
told
that
it
is
possible
to
get
too
much
of
society
and
that
after
it
quiet
is
appreciated
to
this
class
fairview
will
prove
a
satisfactory
place
my
nearest
neighbor
lives
two
miles
away
i
shouldn
t
care
if
he
lived
ten
he
is
an
ignorant
fellow
who
chops
wood
for
a
living
and
he
is
very
considerate
for
he
never
comes
to
see
me
i
think
i
never
spoke
to
my
neighbor
except
to
ask
him
how
much
was
my
debt
we
get
along
very
well
who
is
the
young
man
at
the
window
noticing
bragg
who
had
changed
his
position
and
was
looking
at
the
sky
i
replied
that
he
was
a
friend
of
shepherd
s
and
that
he
had
only
arrived
a
few
days
before
he
looks
as
though
he
was
in
jail
for
murder
and
meditating
an
escape
in
order
to
commit
the
same
offence
with
greater
atrocity
what
is
the
matter
with
him
i
was
afraid
that
this
might
offend
mateel
but
after
seeing
that
bragg
had
not
heard
it
she
laughed
over
it
as
did
the
rest
of
us
she
added
however
that
he
was
in
excellent
health
and
that
he
was
more
moody
than
sullen
and
could
be
very
agreeable
when
he
wanted
to
be
i
judge
he
has
had
too
much
of
society
and
enjoys
the
quiet
of
fairview
he
looks
i
will
swear
that
bragg
s
face
was
the
most
unpleasant
and
disagreeable
at
that
moment
i
had
ever
seen
he
should
visit
the
mill
for
quiet
we
have
no
noise
there
except
the
roar
of
the
water
and
the
rumble
of
the
wheels
and
we
have
grown
so
accustomed
to
these
that
it
would
not
be
quiet
without
them
i
hope
he
will
like
the
at
this
moment
my
father
and
shepherd
came
around
from
the
orchard
and
barker
bowed
low
on
being
presented
i
thought
shepherd
regretted
he
had
not
known
barker
was
so
polite
as
he
could
have
shown
something
in
that
line
himself
but
they
got
on
very
well
together
and
were
soon
talking
like
old
friends
we
sat
there
for
an
hour
or
more
listening
to
their
easy
and
cultured
conversation
and
it
occurred
to
me
with
renewed
force
that
fairview
was
getting
out
of
its
old
ways
shepherd
promised
to
visit
him
the
invitation
having
been
extended
and
my
mother
and
the
minister
s
wife
coming
out
later
the
party
was
so
agreeable
that
i
wondered
we
could
not
have
more
of
it
instead
of
the
discontent
which
usually
oppressed
us
hearing
our
peals
of
laughter
i
hoped
bragg
regretted
he
had
not
been
in
better
humor
and
joined
the
company
but
he
never
looked
that
way
and
pretended
to
be
occupied
with
himself
you
have
never
been
inside
of
fairview
church
damon
my
father
said
to
him
quite
familiarly
late
in
the
afternoon
won
t
you
come
i
will
walk
on
with
ned
barker
replied
and
rising
and
think
of
it
after
i
reach
the
cross
roads
i
see
it
is
almost
time
to
after
taking
his
leave
of
all
of
them
in
a
courteous
way
i
walked
with
him
along
the
path
leading
across
the
field
my
father
excusing
me
from
further
attendance
for
that
purpose
we
proceeded
quite
leisurely
as
there
was
no
hurry
and
after
we
had
walked
a
considerable
distance
my
companion
said
a
very
pretty
girl
and
intelligent
enough
but
weak
she
could
be
coaxed
into
anything
they
say
that
is
true
of
all
i
did
not
know
whether
he
meant
agnes
or
mateel
so
i
inquired
who
the
one
you
call
mateel
she
has
a
pretty
face
but
were
i
inclined
to
criticise
such
a
delightful
girl
i
should
say
she
lacks
decision
the
other
one
hardly
spoke
to
me
what
is
it
they
call
her
the
i
believe
she
is
very
much
of
a
woman
though
evidently
young
i
admire
her
more
than
the
other
one
do
her
people
live
here
no
in
smoky
very
respectable
i
have
no
doubt
i
should
like
to
know
her
father
and
congratulate
her
father
is
dead
i
answered
oh
he
walked
on
in
silence
for
a
considerable
distance
an
orphan
it
s
a
i
narrated
what
little
i
could
tell
of
the
family
after
the
promise
to
agnes
though
i
longed
to
tell
him
of
her
mother
but
it
seemed
to
bore
him
and
he
dismissed
the
subject
after
i
had
concluded
in
a
rhapsody
for
the
gentle
and
patient
agnes
by
this
time
we
had
reached
the
leading
in
one
direction
to
the
church
and
in
the
other
toward
his
home
he
stopped
here
and
said
i
will
not
go
to
the
church
if
you
will
be
good
enough
to
present
my
excuse
to
your
father
it
is
a
long
road
home
and
i
must
walk
it
you
know
that
you
are
always
welcome
at
the
mill
and
that
jo
is
anxious
to
see
you
he
turned
abruptly
on
his
heel
and
walking
away
his
form
was
soon
lost
in
the
rapidly
approaching
darkness
when
i
arrived
at
the
church
i
found
the
others
all
there
and
was
surprised
to
find
bragg
in
better
humor
as
if
the
darkness
suited
his
disposition
better
he
was
walking
about
quite
contentedly
looking
curiously
and
impudently
at
the
knots
of
people
collected
in
the
yard
and
listening
to
what
they
were
saying
at
times
i
thought
he
would
speak
to
them
and
his
eyes
dull
and
heavy
all
day
were
now
as
bright
and
active
as
a
ferret
s
and
i
thought
he
could
penetrate
the
darkness
with
them
for
while
the
services
were
in
progress
he
kept
walking
about
closely
regarding
everything
as
though
it
were
broad
daylight
when
the
people
came
out
he
met
the
shepherds
at
the
door
and
went
down
the
walk
with
mateel
on
his
arm
and
when
they
drove
away
i
thought
i
heard
him
talking
quite
had
the
fellow
s
spirits
deserted
him
at
the
approach
of
day
and
come
back
with
the
darkness
chapter
xii
love
s
young
dream
two
months
had
passed
since
jo
had
gone
to
live
at
the
mill
and
on
a
saturday
afternoon
it
was
arranged
that
i
should
visit
him
and
remain
until
monday
my
father
was
at
the
country
town
a
great
deal
of
late
and
the
farm
was
being
neglected
in
the
hands
of
the
renter
and
his
two
sons
who
i
often
thought
were
shiftless
men
or
they
would
have
owned
a
farm
of
their
own
for
land
was
cheap
and
plentiful
when
he
returned
from
these
visits
to
twin
mounds
he
was
more
thoughtful
than
ever
and
after
making
long
rows
of
figures
in
his
private
book
and
casting
them
up
he
pondered
over
the
result
as
if
he
had
added
another
problem
to
the
number
he
was
always
studying
over
i
did
not
get
started
until
late
and
as
i
rode
away
my
father
came
out
to
say
that
unless
i
hurried
night
would
overtake
me
in
the
woods
and
as
it
was
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
had
paid
me
so
much
attention
i
thought
as
i
rode
along
that
fairview
was
certainly
progressing
and
that
the
old
order
of
things
was
passing
away
the
road
which
i
travelled
led
through
the
fields
past
theodore
meek
s
and
thence
through
the
woods
and
as
i
went
along
leisurely
when
i
was
half
way
it
began
to
grow
dark
this
did
not
alarm
me
however
as
i
was
well
acquainted
with
the
way
and
there
was
no
prospect
of
getting
lost
as
i
came
out
upon
the
ridge
dividing
the
waters
of
bull
river
and
big
creek
where
there
was
an
opening
and
the
trees
gave
way
to
underbrush
i
saw
a
man
ahead
of
me
riding
on
horseback
as
i
was
thinking
he
was
going
my
way
and
would
keep
me
company
i
hurried
on
to
come
up
with
him
but
he
turned
out
of
the
road
when
i
approached
him
and
rode
off
to
the
left
although
it
was
almost
dark
i
recognized
the
horseman
as
clinton
bragg
and
the
direction
he
took
indicated
that
he
was
on
his
way
to
visit
the
shepherds
coming
up
to
the
place
where
he
had
turned
off
i
saw
that
there
was
no
road
and
had
a
mind
to
halloo
to
him
thinking
he
was
not
familiar
with
the
country
and
might
have
lost
his
way
but
before
i
could
put
that
intention
into
execution
he
urged
his
horse
into
a
gallop
and
passed
rapidly
along
the
deep
shadow
skirting
the
other
side
of
the
clearing
i
remembered
then
that
the
fellow
like
an
owl
was
more
himself
after
dark
than
during
the
day
and
supposing
that
he
had
concluded
to
ride
through
the
timber
and
darkness
to
save
distance
i
thought
no
more
of
him
except
to
wish
that
he
would
have
trouble
when
i
arrived
at
the
mill
it
was
long
after
dark
and
wishing
to
surprise
jo
i
put
the
horse
away
alone
as
i
was
familiar
with
the
stables
from
frequent
visits
seeing
no
light
in
the
house
i
supposed
he
was
at
the
mill
and
went
in
there
although
it
was
dark
and
i
should
have
thought
it
deserted
but
for
the
circumstance
that
all
the
machinery
was
in
operation
hearing
some
one
in
the
basement
i
sat
down
until
he
had
finished
and
started
up
the
stairs
when
i
saw
it
was
jo
carrying
a
lantern
and
so
you
have
come
at
last
he
said
hanging
the
lantern
on
his
arm
and
taking
both
my
hands
in
his
i
had
almost
come
to
believe
that
you
had
forgotten
it
has
been
impossible
for
me
to
come
sooner
i
replied
we
have
been
very
busy
at
home
since
you
came
away
and
as
father
spends
a
great
deal
of
his
time
in
town
now
i
have
double
work
to
do
i
have
been
as
anxious
to
come
as
you
have
been
anxious
to
see
me
for
i
have
been
very
lonely
since
you
went
i
am
certain
of
that
he
returned
using
his
lantern
to
look
critically
at
a
wheel
which
i
am
sure
was
all
right
but
he
wanted
me
to
know
that
he
was
in
charge
i
am
certain
you
came
as
soon
as
you
could
my
dear
old
friend
you
like
myself
can
not
always
do
what
you
please
but
now
that
you
have
come
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
i
am
glad
to
see
you
and
you
could
not
have
arrived
at
a
more
favorable
time
i
am
to
stay
here
until
midnight
at
which
time
barker
will
relieve
me
and
you
shall
stay
with
me
and
tell
me
the
i
think
it
is
very
much
to
your
credit
jo
i
said
that
you
are
able
to
run
alone
o
it
is
nothing
he
answered
though
i
could
see
he
was
proud
of
it
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
look
around
and
see
that
the
belts
are
on
and
that
the
machinery
is
running
smoothly
the
mill
runs
itself
and
if
anything
should
go
wrong
i
have
only
to
shut
down
the
gate
and
call
barker
but
nothing
is
likely
to
go
wrong
barker
is
a
fine
miller
and
he
has
everything
so
arranged
that
the
water
does
the
work
with
little
assistance
but
tell
me
how
much
you
have
missed
me
again
and
everything
that
has
occurred
at
home
since
i
came
under
the
first
head
i
could
have
talked
all
night
but
there
was
nothing
new
except
the
arrival
of
bragg
he
was
here
jo
said
thoughtfully
and
i
don
t
like
his
looks
he
came
in
while
i
was
alone
and
inquired
if
this
was
barker
s
mill
i
answered
that
it
was
when
he
said
he
presumed
my
name
was
jo
erring
on
my
confessing
my
name
he
sat
down
on
a
pile
of
sacks
and
watched
me
intently
for
half
an
hour
when
he
got
up
and
went
out
without
saying
a
word
i
suppose
he
went
up
to
the
house
and
looked
at
barker
in
the
same
way
for
i
saw
him
come
out
of
the
door
mount
his
horse
and
ride
away
he
looks
like
one
of
the
devil
s
sons
who
is
he
i
told
all
i
knew
about
him
and
i
thought
jo
was
much
interested
in
the
statement
that
he
had
been
raised
at
mateel
s
old
home
and
that
they
had
grown
up
together
he
s
impudent
whoever
he
is
i
can
say
that
for
him
i
thought
he
wanted
to
buy
me
he
looked
at
me
so
closely
i
suppose
mateel
is
as
pretty
as
i
answered
that
she
wonderfully
improved
on
acquaintance
and
that
having
gone
down
into
the
bottom
of
her
trunk
she
was
better
dressed
than
ever
when
last
i
saw
her
you
know
that
letter
of
apology
to
mateel
i
read
you
jo
inquired
without
paying
much
attention
to
my
remark
i
said
i
remembered
it
very
distinctly
but
i
wondered
why
he
now
regarded
it
so
pleasantly
for
he
was
smiling
well
i
received
an
answer
to
it
a
day
or
two
after
coming
here
accompanied
by
an
invitation
to
visit
her
and
i
don
t
mind
confessing
to
you
that
i
went
as
i
had
learned
a
great
deal
since
i
called
there
the
first
time
with
your
mother
and
was
anxious
she
should
know
it
in
fact
i
have
been
there
three
times
in
three
weeks
it
s
only
a
short
distance
to
their
house
from
here
and
barker
gave
me
so
many
lessons
in
bowing
and
politeness
that
i
couldn
t
resist
the
temptation
to
try
and
how
did
they
work
oh
i
forgot
everything
as
soon
as
i
got
into
the
house
of
course
he
answered
wearily
as
though
he
were
dreadfully
slow
in
learning
to
be
polite
she
came
up
to
me
and
stood
so
close
that
i
hadn
t
room
to
bow
when
her
mother
came
in
she
shook
hands
and
i
couldn
t
have
bowed
to
her
without
pushing
over
my
chair
it
was
a
total
failure
though
i
am
improving
i
take
off
my
hat
now
before
going
in
at
the
gate
i
am
under
contract
to
go
there
night
and
you
shall
accompany
me
i
have
a
new
suit
of
clothes
too
they
arrived
a
few
days
after
i
came
here
i
asked
barker
who
sent
them
and
he
said
he
supposed
it
must
have
been
god
jo
i
said
you
are
very
happy
here
i
can
see
it
i
confess
that
i
am
he
replied
more
contented
than
i
ever
expected
to
be
anywhere
i
am
useful
to
barker
so
he
is
kind
enough
to
say
at
least
and
he
told
me
that
he
intends
to
pay
me
wages
from
the
time
i
came
instead
of
compelling
me
to
work
a
long
while
for
nothing
yes
i
am
very
happy
here
you
have
guessed
my
i
was
heartily
glad
of
it
and
said
so
and
added
that
no
one
deserved
it
more
but
after
all
there
is
nothing
like
a
fairy
story
in
it
nothing
unreal
and
nothing
that
is
likely
to
melt
away
and
leave
me
a
drudge
at
fairview
again
i
am
simply
in
a
place
where
if
i
work
hard
i
shall
get
something
for
it
every
one
ought
to
have
that
opportunity
therefore
it
is
not
too
much
to
hope
that
my
good
fortune
may
continue
i
should
have
been
as
comfortably
situated
as
i
am
now
a
good
many
years
ago
no
one
is
so
unworthy
that
he
does
not
deserve
pay
for
what
work
he
does
well
but
i
have
learned
nothing
and
earned
nothing
until
now
though
i
am
almost
a
man
jo
had
been
a
full
hand
on
the
farm
for
several
years
but
he
never
received
anything
for
it
except
complaints
and
i
understood
what
he
meant
but
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
mateel
i
think
a
great
deal
about
her
it
s
very
odd
but
it
is
very
true
at
home
and
at
your
house
the
poorest
corner
was
too
good
for
jo
with
her
the
best
is
too
poor
i
should
be
very
ungrateful
did
she
not
occupy
my
thoughts
a
great
deal
though
she
is
a
lady
and
i
only
a
rough
country
boy
she
is
so
considerate
of
me
that
i
can
not
help
loving
her
though
it
is
very
presuming
in
me
i
fear
i
feel
as
though
i
were
visiting
a
queen
when
i
go
there
but
she
makes
me
so
welcome
that
i
soon
forget
myself
and
imagine
i
am
a
king
all
of
my
ambition
is
connected
with
her
now
if
i
hope
to
become
a
worthy
man
and
it
is
that
she
may
be
proud
of
me
and
feel
that
i
have
worked
to
please
her
if
i
study
barker
s
books
diligently
by
the
light
of
this
lantern
at
night
it
is
that
i
may
become
more
intelligent
and
worthy
of
the
good
opinion
she
has
of
me
i
dream
of
nothing
pleasant
in
which
she
does
not
have
a
part
if
i
fancy
i
am
happy
she
is
beside
me
and
the
cause
of
it
if
i
have
grown
rich
and
great
in
a
night
i
am
only
glad
of
it
because
it
will
please
mateel
always
and
everywhere
when
my
better
part
is
uppermost
she
is
in
my
thoughts
but
never
when
i
am
contemptible
in
any
way
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
in
short
that
i
am
desperately
in
i
had
suspected
this
for
some
time
though
i
pretended
to
be
greatly
surprised
i
have
never
said
anything
to
her
about
it
he
continued
maybe
i
never
shall
but
ignorant
as
i
am
i
can
see
she
is
glad
to
see
me
when
i
go
there
and
she
would
not
invite
me
back
so
cordially
if
she
could
not
tolerate
me
it
is
very
pleasant
for
an
ignorant
fellow
like
me
to
be
friends
with
a
refined
lady
like
mateel
i
never
thought
there
was
anything
in
life
equal
to
it
she
does
not
seem
to
know
but
that
i
am
of
a
good
family
but
i
intend
to
tell
her
honestly
and
truly
some
time
what
an
unfavored
fellow
i
i
said
she
probably
knew
all
about
him
already
and
was
satisfied
do
you
suppose
she
does
he
inquired
with
the
look
of
a
pleasant
hope
in
his
face
it
would
be
comforting
to
know
that
as
it
would
be
humiliating
to
tell
her
everything
to
my
discredit
i
can
think
of
but
if
ever
i
become
convinced
that
she
loves
me
i
will
tell
her
everything
if
it
kills
he
talked
as
though
he
had
been
a
great
criminal
in
his
time
but
there
was
really
nothing
more
serious
against
him
than
that
his
father
was
an
eccentric
and
his
mother
a
midwife
if
i
except
the
circumstance
that
everybody
said
he
came
of
a
shiftless
family
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
that
i
am
madly
in
love
he
repeated
again
looking
at
the
flame
of
his
lantern
as
though
it
were
likely
to
give
an
opinion
as
to
whether
he
was
or
not
i
don
t
know
whether
to
regard
it
as
a
serious
circumstance
or
a
pleasant
one
they
say
that
one
s
first
love
does
not
amount
to
anything
and
that
one
soon
forgets
it
it
will
not
be
that
way
with
me
i
am
certain
i
should
be
ashamed
to
offer
my
affections
to
another
girl
after
having
loved
mateel
as
madly
as
i
do
now
and
i
should
feel
that
i
was
offering
a
poor
return
for
the
love
i
should
expect
of
a
wife
i
am
convinced
that
a
man
who
has
loved
but
once
makes
a
better
husband
than
one
who
is
in
doubt
as
to
whether
he
ever
loved
at
all
i
would
as
soon
marry
a
widow
with
children
as
a
woman
who
has
been
engaged
and
permitted
the
familiarities
which
are
common
under
such
circumstances
if
there
is
anything
in
love
at
all
it
is
wrong
to
break
an
engagement
a
man
or
woman
who
is
so
uncertain
in
matters
of
the
heart
as
to
contract
a
new
fancy
four
or
five
times
a
year
is
likely
to
be
mistaken
at
last
i
am
not
acquainted
with
many
people
who
are
happily
married
but
i
am
convinced
that
plenty
of
them
may
be
found
in
looking
the
world
over
and
inquiry
will
no
doubt
reveal
the
fact
that
they
were
never
in
love
but
once
if
i
should
marry
it
would
seriously
affect
my
happiness
to
know
that
another
man
i
despise
a
man
anyhow
had
caressed
and
fondled
my
wife
as
an
accepted
lover
i
wouldn
t
live
in
the
same
country
with
him
and
i
should
be
forever
unhappy
for
fear
that
she
loved
him
the
best
it
would
be
a
circumstance
very
much
in
favor
of
a
happy
married
life
for
a
man
to
know
that
his
wife
had
never
seen
anyone
else
she
would
marry
to
know
that
her
lips
had
touched
only
his
and
that
she
was
innocent
as
well
as
i
did
not
know
much
about
such
matters
but
i
thought
jo
expected
a
great
deal
perhaps
too
much
but
he
had
grown
so
serious
that
i
knew
he
was
deeply
concerned
and
though
i
tried
to
change
the
subject
and
talk
about
the
mill
he
answered
me
in
such
a
way
as
to
indicate
that
he
would
talk
of
nothing
but
mateel
that
night
he
was
uneasy
and
worried
in
his
manner
too
although
i
could
not
understand
why
unless
it
was
regret
that
he
had
been
raised
so
poorly
and
that
he
was
only
given
opportunity
to
learn
at
seventeen
for
i
knew
that
in
his
affair
with
mateel
he
had
every
reason
to
feel
satisfied
except
that
he
was
so
young
and
poor
as
to
render
thoughts
of
his
marrying
her
almost
ridiculous
it
may
have
been
that
a
knowledge
of
the
possibilities
of
his
future
made
him
chafe
and
fret
that
he
was
compelled
from
no
fault
of
his
own
to
begin
life
so
late
and
that
he
feared
failure
under
such
circumstances
although
success
would
have
been
certain
under
circumstances
more
favorable
as
if
the
thought
were
disagreeable
he
picked
up
the
lantern
abruptly
and
went
down
under
the
mill
leaving
me
in
the
dark
and
he
remained
so
long
that
at
last
i
followed
i
found
him
leaning
against
a
heavy
timber
looking
at
the
flame
in
his
lantern
again
as
though
it
could
enlighten
him
if
it
would
on
certain
matters
of
which
he
was
anxious
to
know
more
you
are
becoming
as
great
a
thinker
as
father
jo
i
said
touching
him
on
the
shoulder
for
he
had
been
so
occupied
with
his
thoughts
that
he
had
not
noticed
my
approach
you
used
to
dislike
him
very
much
for
recollecting
himself
he
pretended
that
he
had
come
down
to
look
at
something
and
after
seeing
that
it
was
all
right
we
went
up
again
if
i
was
thinking
he
said
it
was
that
i
had
never
thought
of
loving
until
mateel
came
in
my
way
the
possibility
that
some
day
i
should
marry
was
so
remote
that
i
never
considered
it
and
when
you
came
down
there
just
now
i
was
hoping
that
if
ever
i
should
marry
mateel
i
don
t
suppose
i
ever
shall
it
was
only
a
fancy
and
there
is
no
harm
in
telling
it
she
would
confess
to
me
that
thoughts
of
loving
and
marrying
never
came
to
her
until
she
met
me
as
i
intend
to
confess
to
her
and
it
will
be
god
s
holy
truth
i
have
never
even
divided
my
poor
affection
among
my
relatives
you
have
had
it
all
but
i
don
t
think
mateel
would
object
to
although
he
had
only
been
there
a
short
time
i
thought
jo
had
grown
to
be
a
man
since
i
had
seen
him
last
he
looked
larger
and
older
and
acted
and
talked
more
like
one
than
he
did
two
months
before
when
he
was
a
boy
i
can
understand
why
you
love
me
he
said
because
i
have
tried
to
win
your
regard
and
we
have
been
friends
all
our
lives
but
if
mateel
cares
for
me
it
is
because
there
is
more
to
me
than
fairview
has
ever
given
me
credit
for
if
that
is
not
the
case
then
my
ambition
is
hopeless
and
if
i
have
been
thinking
it
is
about
that
it
is
pleasant
for
me
to
know
that
ignorant
and
rough
as
i
am
intelligent
people
can
admire
me
at
all
for
i
am
improving
very
rapidly
and
in
time
i
can
hope
to
become
worthy
of
the
friendship
of
very
good
people
i
am
surprised
to
think
how
ignorant
i
was
a
month
ago
i
shall
be
in
still
greater
wonder
six
months
hence
to
realize
how
foolish
i
was
when
you
first
came
to
see
me
at
the
mill
i
have
no
other
hope
for
the
future
than
that
i
can
learn
something
every
day
for
if
i
live
a
long
time
i
can
hope
to
know
something
at
last
it
is
not
a
great
brain
that
can
be
exhausted
at
thirty
or
even
forty
and
i
expect
to
study
very
hard
from
now
on
that
i
may
catch
up
with
others
of
equal
capacity
who
began
under
more
fortunate
circumstances
i
believe
the
day
is
coming
when
fairview
will
be
peopled
with
the
kind
of
men
and
women
i
am
acquainted
with
in
my
fancy
and
when
they
arrive
i
am
ambitious
to
be
able
to
associate
with
them
without
the
restraint
of
stupidity
and
i
was
about
to
reply
when
we
heard
barker
coming
in
as
the
hour
had
arrived
when
he
was
to
take
charge
although
we
had
not
suspected
that
midnight
was
so
near
at
hand
so
rapidly
had
the
time
passed
barker
greeted
me
pleasantly
and
although
i
supposed
he
had
just
crept
out
of
bed
he
was
as
fresh
and
cheerful
as
it
was
possible
to
be
while
we
were
walking
up
to
the
house
i
mentioned
the
circumstance
to
jo
i
have
never
yet
found
him
asleep
he
replied
i
think
one
of
his
eyes
is
always
open
if
not
both
of
them
but
i
have
given
up
all
curiosity
with
reference
to
him
if
he
has
a
secret
and
wants
me
to
know
it
i
am
always
here
and
he
can
easily
tell
me
but
i
am
content
to
trust
him
just
as
he
is
there
can
t
be
anything
very
bad
about
a
man
who
is
always
fair
just
and
honest
i
have
an
idea
that
when
i
have
earned
his
confidence
i
shall
know
his
secret
if
he
has
one
and
that
he
will
tell
me
in
the
meantime
i
intend
to
make
myself
as
useful
as
possible
and
not
annoy
him
with
my
i
had
intended
to
ask
jo
for
a
theory
with
reference
to
barker
during
the
visit
but
after
this
i
concluded
that
i
would
not
chapter
xiii
the
flock
of
the
goode
shepherd
jo
and
i
agreed
that
we
would
ride
over
to
his
father
s
in
the
forenoon
of
the
next
day
and
return
by
way
of
the
shepherds
in
the
evening
we
started
in
the
morning
before
barker
was
stirring
as
he
had
worked
until
daylight
jo
riding
the
horse
he
had
received
from
my
father
together
with
ten
dollars
in
money
and
i
a
clumsy
but
reliable
animal
from
the
farm
which
i
believe
had
assisted
in
hauling
our
wagons
to
the
country
and
which
rode
about
as
comfortable
as
a
when
we
arrived
at
the
ford
and
as
we
stopped
our
horses
to
allow
them
to
drink
i
saw
that
several
loads
of
stone
for
the
dam
had
arrived
since
my
last
visit
there
and
jo
told
me
he
intended
to
haul
at
least
one
load
a
week
until
he
had
enough
and
that
there
would
occasionally
be
dull
days
at
barker
s
as
in
times
of
high
water
or
ice
when
he
could
work
on
his
own
enterprise
for
days
at
a
time
the
house
of
hewn
logs
occupied
by
my
grandfather
was
built
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
above
the
creek
the
ground
on
the
side
by
which
we
approached
it
being
lower
and
covered
with
timber
and
riding
up
to
the
fence
surrounding
it
we
secured
our
horses
and
went
in
although
it
was
summer
dad
erring
occupied
his
usual
corner
by
the
and
had
evidently
just
finished
smoking
a
pipe
as
the
room
was
yet
full
of
the
fumes
he
was
very
much
surprised
to
see
us
and
was
at
once
cordial
and
hospitable
by
asking
us
to
pull
up
to
the
which
we
did
although
the
fire
had
been
out
for
several
months
she
s
not
at
home
he
said
divining
that
we
wondered
where
gran
was
she
s
away
but
i
don
t
know
where
i
never
do
both
of
you
know
that
already
she
has
been
away
he
rested
one
hand
on
his
knees
and
counted
the
days
on
the
bricks
of
the
hearth
with
his
three
days
she
may
be
at
home
in
an
hour
she
may
not
return
in
a
week
both
of
you
are
familiar
with
the
manner
in
which
she
comes
and
i
had
frequently
remarked
of
my
grandfather
that
while
others
in
fairview
said
little
because
they
were
gloomy
he
said
little
because
he
had
little
to
say
and
after
finishing
what
i
have
quoted
he
stopped
as
if
wondering
how
he
could
find
language
to
give
his
visitors
to
understand
that
they
were
welcome
he
seemed
to
conclude
at
last
that
we
were
anxious
to
know
next
about
his
business
as
if
there
was
nothing
in
the
wide
world
except
his
wife
and
the
shingle
business
and
said
you
ask
how
i
am
getting
along
with
my
we
had
not
mentioned
the
subject
at
all
by
the
way
i
answer
not
very
well
the
trees
cut
very
hard
of
late
and
although
i
go
to
my
work
later
and
come
home
earlier
than
formerly
i
am
more
tired
at
night
than
usual
does
not
progress
very
well
i
am
afraid
i
am
not
as
young
as
i
was
ten
or
twelve
years
ago
but
we
must
all
wear
out
you
two
are
commencing
i
am
finishing
but
i
doubt
if
you
think
of
the
future
more
pleasantly
than
i
do
i
am
always
tired
now
and
rest
to
me
is
as
agreeable
as
hope
to
you
look
at
my
as
he
held
them
out
i
saw
that
they
were
cracked
and
scarred
and
the
flesh
on
them
dry
and
callous
he
had
been
rubbing
them
with
some
kind
of
oil
and
the
fingers
were
so
cold
that
it
remained
on
them
in
lumps
without
melting
they
hurt
me
a
great
we
both
expressed
a
regret
that
his
hands
were
not
better
but
i
am
well
every
other
way
except
that
i
get
tired
so
easy
if
i
could
get
the
cracks
out
of
my
hands
the
shingle
business
would
get
on
i
had
noticed
before
that
he
apologized
for
old
age
and
weakness
in
this
way
and
tried
to
convince
himself
that
he
was
very
well
and
very
strong
except
that
his
hands
would
crack
open
and
occasionally
he
raised
them
up
and
looked
at
the
sores
as
though
they
would
finally
be
the
death
of
him
she
has
good
success
with
other
people
but
poor
luck
with
my
he
always
spoke
of
his
wife
as
she
as
she
always
referred
to
him
as
they
baffle
her
skill
i
suppose
they
are
in
a
bad
he
got
up
at
this
and
began
walking
up
and
down
the
floor
rubbing
his
hands
together
remembering
his
great
feats
at
walking
i
thought
if
his
hands
were
as
sound
as
his
legs
he
would
still
be
a
stout
man
coming
back
to
his
chair
presently
he
sat
down
and
said
to
jo
since
we
are
talking
of
your
new
business
i
may
as
well
say
that
she
has
agreed
that
you
are
to
have
this
i
could
not
help
wondering
what
boy
had
sat
between
them
and
made
a
conversation
on
the
subject
possible
i
don
t
know
whether
it
is
fit
for
what
you
want
it
or
not
but
we
have
both
decided
that
you
may
i
was
surprised
that
he
knew
jo
had
such
an
ambition
or
that
he
knew
jo
had
gone
to
barker
s
to
live
for
it
was
a
chance
that
any
one
had
taken
the
pains
to
tell
him
if
my
hands
get
better
by
the
time
you
are
ready
to
commence
he
said
i
will
help
you
i
was
once
a
good
hand
at
framing
timbers
and
there
is
enough
on
the
place
to
build
the
mill
i
have
picked
out
a
great
many
sticks
in
my
trips
to
the
woods
which
will
be
it
pleased
jo
to
know
that
he
had
been
planning
to
help
him
for
no
one
else
had
i
don
t
want
you
to
help
me
father
he
said
though
i
am
glad
you
offer
to
for
now
i
know
you
have
confidence
in
me
i
intend
to
help
you
after
i
become
a
miller
instead
of
permitting
you
to
help
me
i
am
sorry
i
never
talked
to
you
about
it
before
you
know
more
about
it
than
any
of
i
have
thought
about
your
mill
a
great
deal
was
his
reply
and
have
great
hope
that
you
will
turn
out
a
better
man
than
your
father
i
have
never
amounted
to
much
both
of
you
know
that
but
you
have
a
better
start
it
is
poor
enough
you
can
imagine
what
mine
was
and
you
know
more
than
i
did
at
your
age
i
have
lived
all
my
life
in
places
where
men
were
not
expected
to
amount
to
much
and
were
satisfied
if
they
did
not
it
seems
to
be
different
what
a
dull
country
he
must
have
lived
in
to
have
thought
fairview
superior
to
it
i
think
you
ought
to
build
your
house
where
this
one
stands
he
said
i
have
planted
a
number
of
trees
around
it
for
you
and
i
hope
that
when
you
are
grown
up
your
happy
children
may
play
under
their
shade
it
is
a
pretty
place
here
and
it
is
but
a
few
rods
to
the
best
point
for
a
mill
i
have
more
confidence
in
you
than
any
one
else
i
would
help
you
if
i
jo
was
greatly
affected
by
this
kindness
and
as
an
excuse
to
get
out
of
doors
fearing
he
would
be
weak
enough
to
cry
if
he
remained
there
suggested
that
we
get
dinner
the
idea
was
not
a
bad
one
after
we
came
to
think
more
of
it
and
we
soon
had
it
under
way
my
grandfather
pretended
not
to
know
what
we
were
about
but
i
saw
him
looking
frequently
into
the
kitchen
where
we
were
and
when
it
was
declared
ready
he
tried
to
be
greatly
surprised
there
was
a
number
of
young
chickens
running
around
and
we
had
taken
two
of
these
intending
to
leave
word
for
gran
that
the
hawks
had
been
about
and
that
the
mice
had
been
in
the
pickles
and
preserves
the
dinner
was
jo
s
best
effort
and
being
familiar
with
everything
his
father
was
fond
of
he
succeeded
in
making
him
very
good
natured
it
is
just
such
a
dinner
as
i
can
enjoy
he
said
when
he
sat
down
to
it
you
seem
to
be
able
to
do
everything
jo
but
i
hope
you
will
get
out
of
the
way
for
these
jacks
are
said
to
be
able
to
make
everything
except
money
i
depend
on
you
to
distinguish
your
family
there
is
no
one
else
to
do
it
and
we
come
of
a
long
line
of
very
common
folks
i
enjoy
your
dinner
but
i
am
sorry
you
can
cook
so
well
really
i
am
sorry
i
could
cook
when
i
was
of
your
age
and
i
could
cut
hair
and
i
never
amounted
to
anything
you
should
get
out
of
the
his
good
nature
continued
until
after
the
meal
was
concluded
and
until
we
went
away
for
when
we
had
returned
to
the
front
room
again
he
asked
jo
and
me
to
sing
songs
to
him
while
he
smoked
which
we
cheerfully
did
imitating
the
singers
in
gestures
shouting
and
so
on
which
was
an
accomplishment
we
had
to
be
very
careful
in
exhibiting
then
we
made
prayers
and
speeches
representing
the
meek
winter
and
the
miller
s
sister
and
sang
the
hymn
through
our
noses
commencing
hark
from
the
tomb
a
doleful
sound
all
of
which
so
pleased
my
grandfather
that
he
laughed
and
roared
and
pounded
the
floor
with
his
stick
and
declared
that
we
were
equal
to
a
when
we
said
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
that
we
must
go
he
replied
that
he
sincerely
regretted
it
as
he
had
never
enjoyed
himself
so
well
before
and
made
us
promise
that
we
would
come
back
every
sunday
in
the
future
when
gran
was
away
and
have
an
equally
good
time
we
both
shook
hands
with
him
at
parting
for
the
first
time
in
our
lives
i
think
and
rode
away
waving
adieus
the
shepherds
lived
on
the
other
side
of
big
creek
woods
on
the
high
divide
between
big
creek
and
bull
river
in
a
house
originally
dingy
enough
but
which
had
been
wonderfully
transformed
by
their
living
in
it
the
people
said
enough
money
had
been
spent
in
repairing
it
to
build
a
house
large
enough
for
three
and
it
was
furnished
throughout
in
a
style
very
unusual
in
that
country
although
it
was
no
more
than
comfortable
mateel
met
us
at
the
door
and
as
she
ushered
us
into
the
neat
parlor
i
thought
i
had
never
seen
a
handsomer
woman
with
the
possible
exception
of
agnes
and
i
could
not
but
inwardly
congratulate
jo
on
his
good
fortune
i
thought
that
i
could
see
that
she
was
very
fond
of
him
now
that
it
had
been
called
to
my
mind
though
i
may
only
have
imagined
it
for
she
was
as
polite
to
me
as
to
him
i
am
glad
to
see
you
she
said
taking
my
hat
which
i
was
careful
to
remove
remembering
jo
s
experience
my
father
did
not
feel
well
and
we
are
all
at
home
as
westlock
agreed
to
take
his
place
at
shepherd
came
in
at
this
moment
followed
by
his
respectable
wife
who
bowed
stiffly
to
both
of
us
at
once
as
though
we
were
not
worth
two
separate
efforts
and
impressed
me
at
once
with
his
freedom
for
a
sunday
evening
it
was
a
funeral
day
at
our
house
but
shepherd
laughed
and
talked
as
though
we
were
at
a
party
as
i
looked
at
his
pale
and
effeminate
face
i
thought
that
his
daughter
was
very
much
like
him
and
that
had
a
son
been
born
to
the
family
he
would
have
been
like
his
mother
quiet
dignified
and
capable
i
worked
in
the
field
so
late
saturday
he
said
with
the
utmost
candor
and
freedom
that
i
felt
too
tired
to
preach
so
i
sent
word
to
your
father
that
he
would
oblige
me
by
preaching
a
sermon
on
future
punishment
it
is
one
of
the
rules
of
the
church
that
this
disagreeable
topic
be
discussed
from
the
pulpit
at
least
once
a
year
i
dislike
it
and
am
glad
to
shirk
your
father
is
very
fond
of
the
subject
i
am
told
but
no
difference
what
he
says
about
it
i
will
apologize
next
sunday
and
deny
it
the
religion
of
fairview
seems
to
make
the
people
miserable
i
shall
change
it
if
i
can
i
have
been
religious
all
my
life
and
it
never
caused
me
a
sorrow
i
don
t
believe
in
devils
much
but
i
believe
a
great
deal
in
as
he
looked
at
me
as
if
he
desired
an
expression
on
the
subject
i
said
angels
were
certainly
the
most
comforting
to
think
about
i
have
been
much
distressed
by
the
unhappy
faces
i
have
seen
since
coming
here
and
i
hope
i
may
be
the
humble
instrument
of
brightening
them
the
right
kind
of
religion
will
put
flowers
in
the
yard
let
sunlight
in
at
the
window
and
fill
the
house
with
content
and
happiness
i
became
a
christian
man
because
i
longed
for
heaven
rather
than
because
i
feared
the
dreadful
abode
of
the
wicked
and
it
is
my
intention
to
introduce
this
gospel
shepherd
was
directing
his
conversation
to
me
as
mateel
and
jo
had
retired
to
another
part
of
the
room
and
were
very
much
interested
in
each
other
i
therefore
wished
him
success
in
the
undertaking
i
have
always
thought
that
the
bible
is
such
a
convincing
book
that
it
finally
converts
nearly
all
the
children
of
men
i
hope
all
of
them
though
the
church
to
which
i
belong
does
not
cheerfully
accept
my
opinion
the
bible
is
only
in
dispute
because
a
new
set
of
men
are
coming
on
all
the
time
who
have
also
to
be
convinced
and
saved
its
promises
are
so
magnificent
that
no
one
can
read
them
all
his
life
and
fail
to
put
himself
in
the
way
of
their
fulfilment
therefore
there
is
no
excuse
for
referring
to
the
disagreeable
subject
i
have
just
mentioned
you
may
as
well
look
on
the
bright
side
of
religion
as
on
the
bright
side
of
anything
else
and
you
know
we
are
always
having
maxims
of
this
kind
thrown
at
us
this
is
the
religion
the
present
pastor
of
fairview
believes
in
and
this
is
the
religion
he
will
teach
though
i
have
not
taught
much
of
it
for
i
have
not
mentioned
the
subject
at
all
until
now
but
i
only
came
in
to
say
i
was
glad
to
see
you
and
will
go
out
again
he
said
rising
i
am
becoming
very
worldly
of
late
for
i
have
been
thinking
all
day
of
how
the
potatoes
and
corn
i
ploughed
last
week
are
getting
on
rather
than
of
sermons
and
i
am
so
sleepy
now
that
you
perhaps
noticed
me
blinking
i
am
also
forgetting
a
great
deal
of
my
theology
in
the
hunger
which
constantly
besets
me
and
if
i
raise
nothing
at
all
this
year
i
will
feel
well
repaid
for
my
work
by
the
good
health
i
have
enjoyed
when
you
return
home
express
my
thanks
to
your
father
for
his
as
he
went
out
i
thought
if
he
was
not
a
remarkable
preacher
he
was
certainly
a
good
man
his
respectable
wife
followed
and
as
she
had
not
said
a
word
i
thought
we
should
not
miss
her
company
i
was
just
saying
to
miss
shepherd
jo
said
coming
over
to
me
that
you
and
i
have
been
fast
friends
since
you
were
born
when
i
was
a
very
little
fellow
and
ned
only
a
baby
he
loved
me
and
was
happier
with
me
than
with
anyone
else
it
seems
queer
that
anyone
should
live
to
be
seventeen
years
old
and
have
no
other
intimate
friend
than
his
sister
s
he
addressed
the
remark
to
mateel
but
she
did
not
seem
sure
whether
it
was
queer
or
not
she
was
never
certain
of
anything
like
her
father
i
have
an
idea
that
we
shall
be
old
men
together
and
die
greatly
regretted
by
one
another
jo
continued
i
should
be
content
with
a
very
few
friends
like
ned
a
man
can
not
do
justice
to
a
great
many
as
true
and
good
as
he
is
if
i
were
wealthy
i
should
build
a
high
wall
around
my
house
and
station
a
surly
porter
at
the
gate
instructed
to
admit
only
a
very
few
it
is
one
of
the
disadvantages
of
the
trade
i
am
learning
that
i
shall
be
expected
to
be
sociable
with
every
kind
of
men
i
shall
never
be
free
to
tell
those
i
dislike
to
forever
keep
off
my
premises
as
i
should
like
to
do
but
in
order
to
live
i
shall
be
compelled
to
treat
them
well
for
their
patronage
it
has
been
my
experience
that
only
two
men
out
of
every
ten
have
qualities
worthy
of
cultivation
but
it
would
be
ruinous
to
introduce
such
a
doctrine
into
the
mill
i
saw
that
jo
was
in
an
odd
humor
for
he
had
forgotten
that
he
should
make
himself
agreeable
and
stopped
occasionally
to
think
pretending
not
to
notice
it
i
exchanged
the
little
gossip
of
the
neighborhood
with
mateel
until
jo
said
with
an
effort
to
shake
off
his
gloomy
thoughts
miss
shepherd
i
should
like
to
hear
you
mateel
laughed
a
little
at
this
sudden
invitation
but
opened
the
instrument
and
after
selecting
a
piece
sang
it
the
words
were
of
constancy
and
of
a
lover
who
went
mad
on
learning
that
his
mistress
had
wedded
his
rival
it
s
a
song
about
love
jo
said
after
mateel
had
finished
it
picking
up
the
music
and
looking
curiously
at
the
most
take
that
for
a
subject
do
you
believe
the
story
it
tells
i
sang
it
because
i
believed
it
mateel
said
wincing
under
jo
s
cold
and
steady
gaze
he
was
in
a
very
odd
humor
indeed
i
believe
in
but
one
there
are
so
many
people
who
believe
in
two
or
three
or
half
a
dozen
i
suppose
you
do
all
good
people
are
very
honorable
in
matters
of
this
kind
sometimes
very
bad
people
believe
in
it
i
do
for
i
have
thought
of
this
very
often
since
for
a
great
deal
that
was
horrible
might
have
been
avoided
had
the
conversation
been
candid
on
both
sides
i
would
be
afraid
of
getting
in
love
s
way
he
said
as
though
we
had
been
accusing
him
they
say
it
never
runs
smooth
and
i
should
be
very
unhappy
were
it
to
be
interrupted
the
writer
speaks
of
the
heart
s
silent
secrets
that
seems
to
be
the
general
heart
trouble
it
is
a
repository
of
secrets
and
always
uncomfortable
ones
the
subject
makes
me
miserable
i
never
thought
of
it
in
my
life
that
i
did
not
at
once
become
mateel
laughed
merrily
at
this
and
said
people
usually
thought
of
it
to
be
gay
but
it
is
a
most
serious
subject
after
all
if
a
man
makes
a
mistake
in
any
other
matter
it
is
easily
remedied
a
day
s
work
and
he
is
as
well
as
ever
but
a
mistake
in
love
is
not
so
easily
mended
it
may
make
life
a
failure
and
cause
a
man
to
rest
uneasily
in
his
grave
if
i
should
leave
a
wife
at
death
and
she
should
marry
again
my
very
clay
would
cry
out
in
agony
at
the
thought
under
such
circumstances
i
should
long
to
be
an
unhappy
ghost
that
i
might
be
free
to
walk
the
earth
and
fill
her
nights
with
terror
i
hope
i
am
not
naturally
of
an
ugly
disposition
but
if
this
misfortune
should
happen
to
me
i
would
resign
my
place
in
heaven
and
join
the
devils
in
order
that
i
might
be
wicked
and
cruel
in
my
i
had
never
seen
jo
in
such
a
serious
mood
before
and
mentioned
it
his
old
cheerful
smile
returned
for
a
moment
as
he
made
some
response
but
as
he
kept
on
thinking
it
was
soon
replaced
with
a
frown
mateel
seemed
to
enjoy
his
mood
and
encouraged
it
by
saying
that
a
man
had
a
different
opinion
of
love
every
year
of
his
life
i
never
had
an
opinion
on
the
subject
at
all
until
this
year
was
his
reply
but
i
will
tell
you
what
i
think
of
it
next
year
and
the
next
if
i
am
of
the
same
opinion
then
as
now
you
can
give
me
the
credit
that
my
first
impressions
represented
me
my
first
impressions
of
the
subject
are
that
i
would
as
soon
marry
a
widow
as
a
girl
who
had
been
in
love
before
if
i
were
the
king
of
a
country
i
would
punish
second
marriage
with
death
and
make
it
unlawful
for
a
man
or
woman
to
be
engaged
more
than
once
thus
preventing
the
marital
unhappiness
which
i
am
sure
always
results
when
either
the
wife
or
husband
knows
the
other
has
been
in
love
mateel
laughed
so
heartily
over
this
absurd
idea
that
i
joined
her
in
spite
of
myself
though
i
knew
jo
was
very
serious
and
he
looked
at
us
both
as
though
we
were
attending
his
funeral
and
in
good
spirits
over
the
grave
i
came
here
to
pass
a
pleasant
evening
i
said
to
him
but
if
you
continue
in
this
humor
we
shall
all
have
the
horrors
i
shouldn
t
have
begun
he
said
walking
over
to
the
music
rack
to
look
for
a
hornpipe
i
thought
but
i
have
said
no
more
than
i
really
feel
we
will
settle
it
with
that
and
i
will
never
make
you
uncomfortable
again
by
referring
to
the
having
selected
a
more
cheerful
song
we
tried
to
sing
it
together
but
it
was
a
failure
and
the
evening
dragged
heavily
after
that
so
much
so
that
jo
announced
his
intention
to
go
quite
early
i
was
never
gloomy
in
my
life
before
he
said
to
mateel
on
parting
i
don
t
know
what
caused
me
to
be
for
i
am
usually
happier
here
than
anywhere
else
it
must
have
been
the
gloomy
poet
whose
song
you
sang
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
when
i
come
again
we
will
not
speak
of
love
i
know
so
little
of
it
that
i
can
t
be
entertaining
talking
about
perhaps
your
ignorance
of
love
jo
will
prove
more
serious
than
you
expect
had
you
more
knowledge
of
it
you
would
know
that
your
lonely
fancies
are
wrong
and
that
there
is
not
such
a
woman
in
the
world
as
you
have
created
and
no
such
love
as
you
expect
perhaps
had
you
mingled
more
with
the
world
you
would
have
known
this
and
saved
yourself
much
unhappiness
i
went
out
ahead
of
him
and
he
remained
inside
talking
for
a
few
moments
mateel
seemed
to
be
assuring
him
that
she
was
not
offended
and
i
heard
him
thank
her
quietly
say
his
adieus
and
close
the
door
we
rode
a
considerable
distance
in
silence
for
i
was
waiting
for
jo
to
speak
as
he
had
to
my
mind
emerged
from
boyhood
to
manhood
since
coming
to
the
mill
to
live
and
i
was
not
as
free
in
his
company
as
i
had
been
at
home
i
have
made
poor
progress
he
said
at
last
but
i
was
not
comfortable
while
there
for
some
reason
and
now
i
am
not
satisfied
when
i
am
away
the
next
time
i
go
there
i
intend
to
tell
mateel
that
i
am
madly
in
love
with
her
i
suppose
she
will
call
her
father
and
order
me
out
of
the
house
but
i
can
t
stand
this
suspense
i
have
a
notion
to
send
you
on
home
and
go
back
he
stopped
in
the
road
to
consider
it
but
recollecting
that
it
would
be
a
ridiculous
performance
rode
on
again
my
love
for
her
has
taken
such
complete
possession
of
me
that
i
shall
be
fit
for
nothing
else
until
i
know
what
i
am
to
expect
if
i
were
older
and
not
so
poor
i
would
go
back
declare
my
love
and
insist
that
she
forever
reject
me
or
marry
me
in
five
minutes
but
even
if
she
accepts
me
when
i
offer
myself
it
will
be
years
before
i
can
hope
to
possess
her
i
have
always
been
waiting
first
for
release
from
your
father
then
for
release
from
barker
and
now
for
mateel
i
would
sell
myself
to
the
devil
to
be
delivered
in
four
or
five
years
for
a
little
age
a
home
of
my
own
and
mateel
for
my
wife
now
not
to
wait
a
he
had
said
now
so
loudly
that
it
sounded
like
a
signal
for
the
devil
to
appear
and
complete
the
bargain
of
which
he
had
spoken
and
was
so
stern
that
i
was
afraid
of
him
i
must
curb
this
terrible
passion
or
it
will
do
me
serious
injury
there
is
nothing
in
store
for
me
except
waiting
and
working
and
i
fear
that
by
the
time
i
accomplish
what
i
desire
i
shall
be
so
tired
and
indifferent
that
i
can
not
enjoy
it
as
i
would
now
but
if
i
am
as
happy
when
i
possess
her
as
i
think
i
shall
be
i
will
whip
the
man
who
says
this
is
not
a
happy
world
if
she
is
given
to
me
i
shall
make
her
a
queen
if
it
is
possible
my
only
fear
is
that
being
of
a
poor
family
i
shall
not
be
able
to
accomplish
all
i
desire
barker
says
an
industrious
man
can
accomplish
more
than
a
talented
one
if
that
is
true
i
will
make
mateel
proud
of
me
and
cause
her
to
bless
the
day
she
came
to
fairview
to
live
but
i
intend
to
talk
less
in
the
future
and
do
he
urged
his
horse
into
a
gallop
and
dashed
through
the
dark
woods
like
a
man
on
fire
and
i
followed
expecting
every
moment
to
be
thrown
off
and
injured
i
did
not
come
entirely
up
with
him
until
we
had
reached
the
mill
and
after
putting
away
the
horses
we
went
at
once
to
bed
where
jo
no
doubt
spent
the
night
in
waiting
for
daylight
that
he
might
commence
to
distinguish
himself
chapter
xiv
i
am
surprised
matters
were
going
from
bad
to
worse
at
fairview
my
father
had
been
away
to
the
country
town
a
week
and
had
not
yet
returned
as
the
attendance
on
the
summer
school
was
small
agnes
managed
to
come
home
very
early
and
go
away
very
late
so
that
we
were
like
three
happy
children
having
a
holiday
for
my
mother
remained
up
with
us
until
midnight
if
we
did
not
get
sleepy
before
that
time
talking
very
little
but
quietly
enjoying
our
company
as
though
it
was
a
pleasure
usually
denied
her
i
told
them
all
i
knew
about
jo
mateel
barker
his
strange
sister
and
clinton
bragg
inventing
incidents
whenever
the
interest
threatened
to
flag
and
agnes
was
always
entertaining
so
that
we
were
very
happy
during
that
week
it
was
the
saturday
night
after
my
return
from
the
mill
when
we
were
beginning
to
be
seriously
alarmed
about
my
father
s
long
absence
and
just
after
we
had
agreed
that
something
should
be
done
about
it
the
door
opened
and
he
walked
in
i
had
been
expecting
him
to
return
in
a
bad
humor
but
much
to
my
surprise
he
was
in
a
very
good
humor
and
appeared
to
be
pleased
about
something
as
though
he
had
accomplished
all
he
desired
and
was
good
enough
to
ask
me
if
i
had
enjoyed
myself
at
barker
s
my
mother
and
agnes
went
out
to
the
kitchen
at
once
to
prepare
his
supper
and
he
followed
them
to
talk
while
they
were
about
it
he
had
brought
them
presents
and
holding
up
the
packages
asked
them
to
guess
what
they
were
and
when
they
failed
he
laughed
and
asked
them
to
guess
again
i
looked
on
in
wonder
and
after
he
had
seated
himself
at
the
table
and
commenced
eating
without
asking
a
blessing
he
astonished
us
all
by
saying
well
i
have
bought
the
union
of
states
newspaper
and
a
house
in
twin
mounds
and
we
move
there
to
live
next
monday
what
do
you
all
think
of
it
we
were
so
much
surprised
that
we
could
not
say
what
we
thought
of
it
and
he
continued
i
have
been
making
the
trade
for
several
weeks
but
only
finally
closed
it
and
i
now
hold
the
keys
of
the
establishment
in
my
pocket
the
house
in
which
we
are
to
live
is
vacant
and
i
will
go
over
with
ned
on
monday
and
lee
and
his
sons
are
already
engaged
to
commence
moving
the
next
day
this
may
seem
very
sudden
to
you
but
i
have
been
thinking
of
it
for
months
and
am
already
impatient
at
the
delay
the
farm
will
be
rented
to
lee
and
his
son
will
occupy
this
house
there
is
no
reason
i
can
think
of
why
we
should
not
move
at
once
in
a
month
i
shall
drive
over
and
attend
the
sale
which
i
have
already
advertised
and
then
i
shall
be
taking
from
his
pocket
a
roll
of
which
were
apparently
fresh
from
the
press
he
handed
each
of
us
one
it
began
with
the
heading
public
sale
and
stated
that
the
undersigned
having
bought
the
union
of
states
newspaper
in
twin
mounds
would
offer
at
public
sale
on
the
mentioned
date
at
his
farm
a
half
mile
north
of
fairview
church
the
following
stock
implements
and
effects
here
followed
a
long
list
of
cattle
horses
ploughs
with
which
i
was
very
familiar
and
i
remember
thinking
they
all
looked
exceedingly
well
in
print
i
am
tired
of
fairview
he
said
pushing
back
from
the
table
and
resuming
his
old
habit
of
thoughtfulness
i
am
tired
of
its
work
and
drudgery
i
don
t
dislike
work
but
like
other
men
i
am
anxious
that
it
pay
me
as
much
as
possible
i
shall
continue
to
work
as
hard
as
ever
but
i
hope
to
more
purpose
i
make
little
enough
here
except
in
land
speculations
that
i
can
continue
and
do
more
of
the
profession
i
have
chosen
will
afford
me
opportunity
to
study
that
will
be
a
part
of
my
work
and
we
can
live
more
genteelly
in
town
than
we
have
lived
here
i
feel
that
ten
more
years
on
a
farm
would
make
me
an
old
man
whereas
i
should
at
that
time
only
reach
my
prime
these
are
briefly
the
reasons
why
i
made
the
change
i
have
figured
it
out
it
will
pay
i
could
not
afford
to
make
a
mistake
in
this
i
thought
of
the
long
rows
of
figures
which
he
had
lately
been
casting
up
in
his
private
book
and
the
hours
he
spent
in
pondering
over
the
result
three
men
are
now
necessary
to
do
the
work
in
publishing
the
union
of
in
a
year
ned
and
i
will
be
able
to
do
it
ourselves
for
we
will
work
as
hard
there
as
here
but
as
i
have
said
to
more
purpose
the
time
a
boy
spends
in
learning
the
trade
of
a
printer
is
equal
to
so
much
time
at
school
therefore
ned
will
practically
be
at
school
summer
and
winter
and
of
some
use
besides
the
boy
is
now
reaching
an
age
when
his
education
should
be
attended
to
and
to
all
intents
and
purposes
he
will
begin
a
term
in
an
academy
next
he
got
up
at
this
and
went
to
bed
leaving
us
to
talk
about
it
from
the
cold
and
cheerless
manner
in
which
he
said
i
would
be
able
to
do
the
work
of
a
man
and
a
half
in
a
year
i
judged
there
was
to
be
little
idleness
for
me
in
the
new
place
and
besides
my
work
he
expected
me
to
look
after
my
education
which
had
certainly
been
neglected
in
the
past
although
the
paper
had
been
coming
to
the
house
for
years
we
had
paid
but
little
attention
to
it
so
agnes
and
i
took
the
lamp
and
ransacked
everywhere
for
a
copy
of
the
union
of
states
that
we
might
examine
it
in
a
new
light
we
found
one
at
last
artistically
notched
and
doing
duty
on
a
pantry
shelf
it
was
a
sheet
of
eight
columns
to
the
page
printed
in
large
type
and
we
could
not
help
admitting
it
was
really
the
case
that
it
was
well
printed
and
very
fair
looking
i
read
most
of
the
advertisements
aloud
and
wondered
whether
we
should
speedily
become
acquainted
with
the
parties
or
whether
years
would
be
required
to
get
into
their
aristocratic
circles
for
in
connection
with
statements
that
they
carried
the
principal
stocks
of
goods
in
their
line
in
the
west
at
that
distance
they
seemed
very
important
and
distinguished
however
as
they
all
claimed
the
distinction
of
being
the
leading
merchant
of
twin
mounds
i
thought
that
perhaps
the
advertisements
were
overdrawn
and
that
i
might
know
them
at
least
by
sight
within
a
few
months
there
was
almost
a
full
page
of
law
notices
some
of
them
from
adjoining
counties
where
newspapers
were
not
published
at
the
foot
of
each
one
was
printed
printer
s
fee
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
most
of
the
revenue
was
derived
from
this
source
i
read
four
or
five
of
these
but
as
they
were
all
in
nearly
the
same
language
i
gave
it
up
there
was
also
a
large
advertisement
of
the
paper
itself
occupying
two
full
columns
commencing
with
the
figures
of
the
year
in
which
it
was
established
and
the
figures
of
the
current
year
from
which
i
made
out
that
the
paper
had
been
published
seven
years
followed
by
subscribe
subscribe
in
large
black
letters
then
came
a
long
platform
of
dull
political
principles
and
a
declaration
that
it
was
the
duty
of
every
good
citizen
to
take
it
because
it
advocated
benton
county
first
and
the
world
afterward
after
this
came
a
paragraph
separated
from
the
other
part
of
the
advertisement
by
dashes
and
o
s
o
o
stating
that
job
printing
in
all
its
branches
from
a
mammoth
poster
to
the
most
delicate
visiting
card
would
be
neatly
and
promptly
executed
on
the
new
and
fast
presses
belonging
to
the
establishment
and
immediately
above
the
information
that
all
letters
should
be
addressed
to
the
proprietor
to
insure
prompt
attention
as
though
there
had
once
been
a
habit
of
sending
letters
intended
for
the
printer
to
the
blacksmith
it
was
said
that
one
copy
one
year
would
be
two
dollars
invariably
in
advance
one
copy
six
months
one
dollar
also
invariably
in
advance
one
copy
three
months
fifty
cents
also
invariably
in
advance
and
that
single
copies
in
neat
wrappers
for
mailing
could
be
had
on
application
at
five
cents
each
we
had
no
idea
what
the
business
was
like
and
sat
there
until
midnight
discussing
and
wondering
about
it
occasionally
referring
to
the
sheet
to
prove
or
disprove
a
notion
advanced
by
one
of
the
number
my
own
idea
was
that
the
paper
was
bought
in
a
distant
market
as
an
article
of
merchandise
and
that
my
part
of
the
business
would
be
to
stand
behind
a
counter
and
sell
copies
at
an
advance
in
connection
with
mammoth
posters
and
delicate
visiting
cards
but
agnes
said
that
while
she
knew
nothing
about
the
newspaper
business
she
was
certain
that
idea
was
wrong
and
so
it
turned
out
when
i
suggested
that
agnes
could
no
longer
live
with
us
it
occurred
to
me
all
of
a
sudden
very
late
in
the
evening
and
almost
took
my
breath
away
my
mother
who
had
evidently
not
thought
of
it
before
either
got
up
hurriedly
and
went
out
of
the
room
i
expressed
the
fear
that
she
had
gone
away
to
cry
about
it
whereupon
agnes
went
after
her
and
came
leading
her
back
presently
with
her
arms
tenderly
about
her
i
can
come
over
every
saturday
agnes
said
and
we
shall
all
be
so
busy
during
the
week
as
not
to
notice
the
separation
i
shall
miss
you
more
than
you
can
possibly
miss
me
for
i
always
think
of
this
as
my
home
but
it
is
not
far
and
we
shall
often
be
together
my
school
will
be
out
in
three
weeks
when
i
will
come
over
and
stay
until
you
are
tired
of
as
though
we
should
ever
tire
of
agnes
but
my
mother
would
not
be
comforted
and
continued
to
cry
softly
to
herself
thinking
i
have
no
doubt
that
she
was
about
to
separate
from
the
only
creature
in
all
the
world
who
had
ever
been
kind
and
considerate
and
fond
of
her
when
i
went
to
bed
i
left
them
together
agnes
gently
stroking
my
mother
s
hair
and
assuring
her
that
she
was
her
dear
kind
good
friend
and
that
she
would
never
forget
how
welcome
she
had
always
been
made
in
her
new
home
chapter
xv
the
country
town
it
was
barely
daylight
the
following
monday
morning
when
i
started
with
my
father
for
twin
mounds
where
we
were
to
take
possession
of
the
union
of
states
newspaper
as
we
were
getting
into
the
wagon
agnes
came
out
to
hand
me
a
letter
which
she
said
she
had
written
the
night
before
because
opportunity
did
not
present
itself
to
tell
me
what
it
contained
as
my
father
was
impatiently
waiting
to
start
with
the
lines
in
his
hands
i
only
had
time
to
say
that
i
would
see
her
in
a
few
weeks
and
kissing
my
hand
to
her
we
drove
away
she
waved
her
handkerchief
until
we
were
out
of
sight
when
i
soon
forgot
her
and
the
letter
in
the
excitement
of
the
visit
to
a
strange
place
and
the
engaging
in
a
work
of
which
i
had
no
knowledge
my
father
s
usual
humor
had
returned
and
he
drove
along
without
speaking
except
occasionally
to
the
horses
once
or
twice
he
began
to
sing
the
songs
for
which
he
was
famous
but
he
was
evidently
not
in
tune
that
day
for
he
soon
gave
it
up
i
had
never
been
to
twin
mounds
as
there
was
a
and
a
small
several
miles
nearer
and
had
no
idea
how
it
looked
and
knew
nothing
of
it
except
that
it
had
a
brick
a
stone
jail
several
wooden
stores
a
and
about
six
hundred
very
wicked
people
this
i
had
incidentally
learned
from
listening
to
people
talk
who
had
been
there
and
i
was
so
occupied
in
thinking
it
all
over
that
i
had
no
inclination
to
talk
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
after
i
grew
up
perhaps
i
shall
be
a
thinking
man
like
my
father
for
we
did
not
exchange
a
word
during
the
long
drive
several
times
as
we
drove
along
i
caught
him
looking
at
me
and
i
thought
he
was
wondering
how
i
would
get
on
in
the
new
business
but
as
he
looked
away
quickly
when
i
caught
him
at
it
i
concluded
he
was
at
his
old
habit
of
mentally
accusing
me
of
being
dull
which
made
me
very
wretched
i
never
knew
what
his
objection
to
me
was
but
i
always
believed
that
when
he
looked
at
me
and
then
resumed
his
thinking
he
was
accusing
me
of
something
at
last
we
came
in
sight
of
the
place
we
came
upon
it
suddenly
after
reaching
a
high
place
which
overlooked
it
and
i
occupied
myself
in
wondering
where
the
house
in
which
we
were
to
live
and
the
office
in
which
i
was
to
work
were
located
until
we
stopped
at
a
place
where
horses
were
cared
for
adjoining
and
evidently
belonging
to
a
hotel
in
front
of
which
a
swinging
sign
was
displayed
under
a
bell
announcing
that
the
twin
mounds
house
was
kept
there
i
noticed
that
all
the
business
places
were
in
a
square
in
the
centre
of
which
was
the
brick
and
in
one
corner
of
the
yard
the
stone
jail
in
a
valley
north
of
the
town
ran
a
river
and
on
its
banks
were
mills
and
the
site
of
twin
mounds
had
evidently
been
timbered
originally
for
in
the
people
s
yards
i
saw
great
oak
and
hickory
trees
and
the
woods
adjoined
the
town
on
every
side
great
numbers
of
impudent
boys
dressed
in
a
rakish
fashion
with
which
i
was
not
at
all
familiar
abounded
and
while
i
was
thinking
i
should
certainly
have
trouble
with
these
my
father
started
down
the
street
with
long
strides
telling
me
to
follow
stopping
in
front
of
a
low
wooden
building
which
had
evidently
been
used
at
some
time
in
its
history
as
a
dwelling
and
on
the
front
porch
of
which
was
a
board
sign
reading
printing
office
we
went
in
where
we
found
three
men
two
with
paper
caps
on
who
were
throwing
their
arms
violently
around
over
a
high
stand
and
the
other
a
pale
man
seated
at
a
desk
who
was
evidently
the
retiring
proprietor
this
man
and
one
of
those
with
a
paper
cap
on
his
head
spoke
pleasantly
to
my
father
and
looked
inquiringly
at
me
this
is
the
son
i
have
told
you
about
he
explained
pointing
at
me
as
if
i
were
a
bag
of
corn
he
is
ready
to
commence
learning
the
printer
s
this
was
addressed
to
one
of
the
men
who
wore
the
paper
caps
and
he
began
at
once
to
initiate
me
in
the
mysteries
of
his
craft
i
soon
learned
that
the
high
table
at
which
he
worked
was
covered
with
shallow
boxes
and
that
each
one
contained
a
different
letter
every
character
in
the
language
was
hid
away
in
the
nooks
and
corners
and
my
first
work
was
to
hunt
them
out
and
remember
them
for
future
reference
this
i
began
immediately
and
became
so
interested
in
it
that
i
did
not
notice
for
some
time
that
a
number
of
the
boys
i
had
seen
when
first
driving
into
the
town
had
collected
outside
the
window
to
look
at
me
these
were
evidently
the
town
boys
of
whom
i
had
heard
and
no
doubt
they
were
waiting
for
me
to
come
out
and
fight
to
see
of
what
kind
of
stuff
i
was
made
it
was
the
understanding
in
the
country
that
all
town
boys
were
knockers
and
that
every
country
boy
who
went
there
to
live
must
fight
his
way
to
respectability
they
were
less
ferocious
than
i
had
expected
and
as
i
was
much
stronger
than
any
of
them
i
should
have
gone
out
and
thrown
them
all
over
the
house
but
for
the
fact
that
my
father
did
not
countenance
fighting
they
were
generally
from
high
living
and
idleness
i
thought
and
while
i
was
engaged
with
pleasant
thoughts
to
myself
that
when
jo
came
over
we
would
capture
twin
mounds
my
attention
was
called
to
the
circumstance
by
my
friend
in
the
paper
cap
that
it
was
noon
and
that
my
father
evidently
intended
that
i
should
go
out
with
him
to
dinner
for
he
had
gone
himself
without
making
any
other
arrangement
i
had
heard
them
call
him
martin
and
he
appeared
to
be
very
much
of
a
gentleman
for
before
we
went
out
he
showed
me
through
the
establishment
and
explained
as
much
of
it
as
he
thought
i
could
understand
the
press
was
in
a
little
room
by
itself
there
was
but
one
although
i
remembered
that
in
the
advertisement
it
was
said
that
the
office
was
supplied
with
new
and
fast
presses
and
from
the
paper
on
the
wall
i
judged
that
the
former
owner
of
the
house
had
occupied
that
particular
part
of
it
with
a
bed
back
of
that
was
a
place
for
plunder
formerly
a
kitchen
and
back
of
that
still
a
yard
and
a
deserted
garden
there
was
also
in
the
yard
a
large
and
to
the
branches
of
this
was
suspended
a
hammock
in
which
martin
said
i
might
sometimes
sleep
if
i
became
a
friend
of
his
as
he
had
no
doubt
i
should
while
we
walked
to
the
hotel
he
explained
that
he
was
the
foreman
and
that
as
i
was
to
learn
the
trade
under
him
we
should
be
a
great
deal
together
it
is
not
much
of
a
trade
he
said
and
if
you
are
a
bright
boy
you
will
speedily
acquire
it
you
can
learn
it
in
six
months
or
three
years
just
as
you
please
for
i
have
known
boys
to
become
excellent
printers
in
six
months
while
others
with
thicker
heads
were
about
it
three
or
four
years
but
as
your
father
said
you
were
to
stay
with
me
i
will
tell
you
more
about
it
going
into
the
hotel
we
found
a
large
number
of
men
seated
at
a
long
table
in
a
long
room
every
one
eating
hurriedly
as
though
oppressed
with
the
fear
that
the
supply
in
the
kitchen
was
likely
to
give
out
before
they
were
filled
near
the
head
of
the
table
sat
my
father
and
the
pale
proprietor
and
between
them
and
martin
the
other
man
who
wore
the
paper
cap
whose
name
seemed
to
be
adams
from
which
circumstance
i
thought
there
was
no
other
hotel
in
the
place
opposite
him
sat
clinton
bragg
i
noticed
with
some
astonishment
forgetting
for
a
moment
that
twin
mounds
was
his
home
and
he
looked
as
sullen
and
mean
as
ever
but
he
was
not
so
well
dressed
as
when
i
had
seen
him
at
fairview
he
could
not
help
being
aware
of
my
father
s
presence
but
they
had
evidently
mutually
agreed
not
to
renew
their
acquaintance
though
i
noticed
that
bragg
stopped
working
his
jaws
when
my
father
was
speaking
to
his
companion
and
listened
to
what
was
being
said
as
though
he
wondered
how
it
came
we
were
both
there
some
of
the
other
men
were
flashily
dressed
and
some
of
them
plainly
and
they
talked
a
great
deal
to
each
other
about
their
business
and
by
listening
to
this
i
learned
which
of
them
occupied
shops
and
stores
and
offices
and
which
one
was
the
driver
of
the
stage
that
made
two
trips
a
week
to
a
railroad
station
a
long
way
off
the
dinner
was
served
in
large
plates
distributed
at
convenient
distances
apart
and
two
smart
girls
in
stiff
aprons
and
dresses
were
in
attendance
should
any
one
think
anything
additional
could
be
had
by
asking
for
it
and
both
of
them
seemed
to
be
on
very
confidential
terms
with
the
boarders
for
they
talked
to
them
familiarly
and
called
them
tiresome
and
impudent
and
i
don
t
know
what
all
a
small
man
with
a
hump
on
his
back
who
occasionally
came
into
the
room
i
took
to
be
the
proprietor
and
martin
told
me
afterwards
that
i
was
right
and
that
while
he
was
rather
an
agreeable
man
his
health
was
wretched
after
most
of
the
boarders
had
gone
out
his
wife
came
in
with
her
family
and
from
her
conversation
i
learned
that
she
conducted
a
shop
for
making
bonnets
and
dresses
in
the
parlor
of
the
house
and
that
business
was
dreadfully
dull
i
spent
the
afternoon
in
studying
the
mystery
of
the
boxes
and
was
encouraged
to
find
all
the
letters
of
my
name
my
father
was
very
busy
at
the
desk
with
the
pale
proprietor
posting
himself
with
reference
to
his
future
work
and
was
very
careful
and
thorough
in
his
inquiries
into
the
details
from
which
i
believed
he
would
speedily
become
accustomed
to
his
new
position
the
pale
proprietor
was
evidently
not
accustomed
to
so
much
work
in
one
afternoon
for
he
yawned
frequently
and
seemed
bored
but
my
father
kept
him
at
it
steadily
half
the
boys
belonging
in
the
town
appeared
at
the
window
before
night
to
look
at
me
and
i
noticed
with
alarm
that
they
were
not
all
pale
and
sickly
as
the
first
lot
had
been
which
evidently
meant
trouble
ahead
several
of
them
wore
their
father
s
boots
and
coats
with
leather
belts
around
their
bodies
which
they
buckled
up
from
tune
to
time
as
the
afternoon
wore
away
and
most
of
them
chewed
plug
tobacco
which
was
passed
around
by
a
boy
i
judged
belonged
to
a
storekeeper
occasionally
they
got
up
a
game
and
tried
to
play
at
it
but
the
interest
soon
flagged
and
they
returned
to
the
window
to
look
at
me
once
when
they
became
more
noisy
than
usual
the
printer
named
adams
dashed
out
and
drove
them
away
as
he
would
chase
so
many
hens
but
they
soon
came
back
again
and
stared
at
me
i
pretended
not
to
notice
them
as
though
they
were
of
no
consequence
but
they
made
me
very
miserable
for
they
were
evidently
the
town
boys
i
had
been
warned
against
there
was
one
who
appeared
late
in
the
afternoon
who
looked
particularly
like
a
fighter
and
the
others
immediately
gathered
around
him
to
tell
him
of
my
arrival
he
was
so
that
i
thought
it
would
be
impossible
to
get
him
off
his
feet
when
the
inevitable
clash
came
for
i
was
certain
he
was
the
boy
picked
out
to
do
me
bodily
injury
and
as
soon
as
he
had
been
told
of
my
appearance
among
them
he
walked
straight
over
to
the
window
and
flattening
his
nose
against
the
glass
looked
at
me
with
great
impudence
i
thought
i
would
turn
upon
him
suddenly
and
frighten
him
but
he
seemed
rather
glad
that
i
had
turned
my
head
that
he
might
see
my
eyes
and
face
indeed
instead
of
being
abashed
he
made
the
ugliest
face
at
me
i
have
ever
seen
and
drawing
back
from
the
window
spit
at
me
through
a
vacancy
in
his
lower
row
of
teeth
he
remained
around
there
for
an
hour
or
more
walking
on
his
hands
and
turning
somersaults
for
my
benefit
and
once
he
lay
down
flat
in
the
road
and
invited
four
of
the
others
to
hold
him
there
the
ease
with
which
he
got
up
made
me
more
uncomfortable
than
ever
although
they
called
him
shorty
he
was
really
a
very
long
boy
of
his
age
and
wore
a
coat
which
hung
about
him
in
shreds
and
instead
of
a
shirt
he
had
on
a
brown
duster
tucked
into
a
pair
of
pants
as
much
too
small
as
the
coat
was
too
large
to
add
to
my
discomfort
i
heard
adams
say
to
martin
that
the
town
authorities
really
ought
to
do
something
with
shorty
wilkinson
for
he
was
always
fighting
and
hurting
somebody
when
we
went
to
supper
at
the
hotel
the
same
men
were
there
and
as
i
expected
bragg
was
in
better
humor
promising
by
dark
to
be
agreeable
his
principal
characteristic
was
sullen
indifference
and
i
wondered
if
a
bomb
exploded
under
his
chair
would
disturb
him
they
all
disliked
him
evidently
from
which
circumstance
i
imagined
he
regarded
them
as
a
herd
as
he
had
regarded
the
people
of
fairview
nobody
spoke
to
him
or
he
to
any
one
and
his
only
tribute
to
the
approaching
darkness
was
a
noticeable
softening
in
his
indifference
for
occasionally
he
stopped
his
jaws
he
munched
his
food
like
an
animal
and
impatiently
as
though
he
disliked
the
disagreeable
necessity
of
having
a
habit
in
common
with
such
people
to
listen
to
what
was
being
said
but
at
dinner
he
was
oblivious
to
everything
he
went
out
before
me
and
when
i
passed
through
the
office
i
saw
him
looking
at
a
copy
of
the
union
of
states
and
i
was
glad
we
had
not
yet
taken
charge
for
i
was
sure
he
was
making
fun
of
it
after
martin
came
out
we
walked
down
to
the
house
where
we
were
to
live
which
was
a
considerable
distance
down
the
street
from
where
the
hotel
was
kept
and
which
was
in
a
lonely
location
on
the
brow
of
a
hill
overlooking
the
valley
and
the
mills
directly
opposite
and
across
the
river
were
the
mounds
which
gave
the
town
its
name
a
pair
of
little
mountains
where
it
was
said
the
indians
built
signal
fires
when
they
occupied
the
country
and
where
they
buried
their
dead
for
human
bones
were
often
found
there
by
curious
persons
who
dug
among
the
rocks
the
house
was
built
of
stone
in
the
centre
of
a
great
many
lots
surrounded
by
heavy
hardwood
trees
and
as
we
went
through
the
rooms
martin
explained
that
it
had
been
occupied
long
before
he
came
there
by
an
indian
agent
and
that
twin
mounds
was
originally
an
agency
where
the
indians
came
to
draw
their
supplies
but
the
agency
and
the
indians
had
been
removed
further
west
years
ago
and
the
house
sold
to
an
eccentric
bachelor
who
occupied
it
alone
until
a
few
months
before
when
he
died
and
the
place
being
offered
for
sale
it
came
into
possession
of
my
father
it
was
two
stories
high
built
in
such
a
manner
as
to
contain
six
large
rooms
of
about
the
same
size
and
there
were
iron
shutters
at
all
the
windows
and
doors
and
the
roof
was
of
slate
which
martin
said
was
a
precaution
the
agent
had
taken
against
the
treachery
of
his
wards
it
was
in
good
repair
but
i
feared
we
should
be
very
lonely
in
it
and
felt
better
when
we
were
out
in
the
street
again
returning
to
the
office
i
sat
with
him
until
dark
on
the
little
porch
in
front
on
top
of
which
was
the
long
printing
office
sign
and
i
became
convinced
that
i
should
learn
rapidly
under
him
for
he
took
great
pains
to
prepare
me
for
the
work
and
delivered
a
sort
of
lecture
with
reference
to
printing
in
general
which
was
very
instructive
he
said
after
a
while
that
he
would
go
out
and
swing
in
the
hammock
leaving
me
alone
and
while
wondering
what
i
should
do
to
amuse
myself
i
remembered
the
letter
agnes
had
given
me
i
opened
it
eagerly
and
after
finding
a
light
with
some
difficulty
read
my
dear
ned
i
tried
to
get
an
opportunity
to
say
to
you
on
sunday
night
but
it
did
not
present
itself
therefore
i
write
you
this
letter
you
said
to
me
once
that
i
loved
every
one
in
fairview
alike
which
is
very
near
the
truth
now
that
you
are
away
for
i
thought
more
of
you
than
any
of
them
and
express
the
sentiment
since
we
are
no
longer
to
be
together
i
hope
it
will
be
a
comfort
to
you
to
know
that
i
esteem
you
as
my
best
friend
and
in
your
new
home
i
desire
you
to
think
of
me
in
the
same
way
for
i
shall
never
change
if
i
have
been
a
blessing
to
you
as
you
have
said
so
you
have
been
to
me
and
we
have
mutually
enjoyed
the
friendship
of
the
years
we
were
together
it
is
natural
to
suppose
that
you
will
rapidly
improve
in
your
new
position
i
sincerely
hope
you
will
and
i
have
so
much
confidence
in
you
that
i
have
no
favor
to
ask
except
that
you
always
remain
my
worthy
friend
my
greatest
ambition
for
your
future
is
that
your
boyhood
will
not
fill
your
manhood
with
regrets
i
have
always
told
you
that
it
is
best
to
do
right
in
everything
and
while
you
may
not
succeed
in
this
entirely
come
as
near
it
as
you
can
the
next
seven
years
will
be
the
most
precious
of
your
life
and
if
i
have
a
favor
to
ask
it
is
that
you
will
improve
them
i
believe
in
you
and
shall
always
be
proud
of
your
friendship
it
has
been
manly
pure
and
honest
and
all
the
more
acceptable
because
i
have
neither
brothers
nor
sisters
like
yourself
in
one
sense
you
have
been
my
protégé
i
undertook
your
education
and
taught
you
more
at
home
than
at
school
and
if
you
succeed
well
in
life
as
i
am
confident
you
will
it
will
at
least
be
evidence
that
i
did
the
best
i
could
probably
i
shall
be
your
last
teacher
for
your
father
is
a
busy
man
and
will
no
doubt
train
you
in
his
way
therefore
i
hope
you
will
realize
how
necessary
it
is
that
you
apply
yourself
and
learn
whenever
there
is
opportunity
there
is
nothing
in
the
future
for
me
but
to
teach
other
deserving
boys
but
everything
for
you
do
the
best
you
can
and
i
shall
be
proud
of
you
all
my
life
always
your
friend
agnes
i
had
it
in
my
mind
to
sit
down
and
write
a
long
reply
at
once
but
much
to
my
surprise
clinton
bragg
came
in
at
this
moment
and
interrupted
me
from
what
he
said
on
entering
i
judged
he
was
looking
for
the
printer
named
adams
who
was
a
dissolute
fellow
but
seeing
i
was
alone
he
sat
down
i
had
disliked
bragg
from
the
first
but
he
seemed
friendly
enough
and
taking
a
bottle
of
liquor
from
his
pocket
asked
me
to
drink
with
him
this
i
refused
to
do
whereupon
he
held
the
bottle
in
his
hand
a
long
while
as
if
dreading
to
drink
it
at
length
he
went
into
another
room
and
returned
with
a
dipper
of
water
after
which
he
took
a
drink
of
the
liquor
but
it
gagged
him
so
that
he
couldn
t
get
the
water
to
his
lips
to
put
out
the
fire
and
he
coughed
and
spit
in
such
a
manner
as
to
alarm
me
the
tears
were
standing
in
his
eyes
when
he
finished
do
you
like
it
i
asked
i
like
good
liquor
he
replied
wiping
the
tears
out
of
his
eyes
this
is
horrible
i
believe
i
will
throw
it
he
made
a
motion
as
if
to
toss
the
bottle
out
into
the
street
but
he
didn
t
do
it
probably
reflecting
that
it
would
do
very
well
to
carry
in
his
pocket
i
am
certain
that
he
came
in
to
let
me
know
that
he
was
addicted
to
drink
as
he
was
very
proud
of
that
reputation
and
although
liquor
was
revolting
to
him
he
was
always
trying
to
create
the
impression
that
he
could
not
possibly
let
it
alone
i
inferred
also
that
he
was
well
acquainted
around
the
establishment
by
reason
of
his
association
with
adams
for
he
seemed
quite
at
home
martin
don
t
drink
he
said
after
trying
to
revive
the
stub
of
his
cigar
and
several
ineffectual
attempts
to
light
it
with
a
match
martin
does
nothing
that
is
not
sensible
he
is
out
there
in
the
hammock
asleep
now
while
i
carouse
around
half
the
night
where
do
you
intend
to
sleep
i
replied
that
i
believed
i
was
to
sleep
there
somewhere
although
i
had
it
in
my
mind
to
say
it
was
none
of
his
business
i
showed
my
contempt
for
him
so
plainly
that
he
was
ill
at
ease
as
though
he
felt
that
his
attempt
to
convince
me
that
he
was
a
drinking
man
had
failed
there
is
a
cot
in
the
plunder
room
i
suppose
that
is
for
you
he
said
i
have
a
room
above
here
i
believe
i
will
wander
up
that
way
and
go
to
he
skulked
off
like
a
guilty
dog
going
through
the
yard
and
stopped
occasionally
as
if
to
wonder
if
something
that
would
amuse
him
were
not
going
on
at
some
of
the
places
lit
up
around
the
square
being
satisfied
at
last
apparently
that
the
same
old
loungers
were
probably
there
with
their
rude
jokes
and
uninteresting
experiences
he
turned
the
corner
and
passed
out
of
sight
chapter
xvi
more
of
the
village
of
twin
mounds
in
twin
mounds
the
citizens
spent
their
idle
time
in
religious
discussions
and
although
i
lived
there
a
great
many
years
i
do
not
remember
that
any
of
the
questions
in
dispute
were
ever
settled
they
never
discussed
politics
with
any
animation
and
read
but
little
except
in
the
bible
to
find
points
to
dispute
but
of
religion
they
never
tired
and
many
of
them
could
quote
the
sacred
word
by
the
page
no
two
of
them
ever
exactly
agreed
in
their
ideas
for
men
who
thought
alike
on
baptism
violently
quarrelled
when
the
resurrection
was
mentioned
and
two
of
them
who
engaged
a
one
night
would
in
all
probability
fail
to
agree
themselves
the
next
on
the
atonement
the
merchants
neglected
their
customers
when
they
had
them
to
discuss
points
in
the
bible
which
i
used
to
think
were
not
of
the
slightest
consequence
and
in
many
instances
the
men
who
argued
the
most
were
those
who
chased
deer
with
hounds
on
sunday
and
ran
horse
races
for
they
did
not
seem
to
discuss
the
subject
so
much
on
account
of
its
importance
as
because
of
its
fitness
as
a
topic
to
quarrel
about
there
was
always
a
number
of
famous
discussions
going
on
as
between
the
lawyer
and
the
storekeeper
or
the
blacksmith
and
the
druggist
or
the
doctor
and
the
carpenter
and
whenever
i
saw
a
crowd
gathering
hurriedly
in
the
evening
i
knew
that
two
of
the
disputants
had
got
together
again
to
renew
their
old
difficulty
which
they
kept
up
until
a
late
hour
in
the
presence
of
half
the
town
there
was
a
certain
man
who
kept
a
drug
store
who
was
always
in
nervous
excitement
from
something
a
fat
blacksmith
had
said
to
him
in
their
discussions
and
who
had
a
habit
of
coming
in
on
him
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
whenever
i
went
into
the
place
of
business
of
either
one
of
them
i
heard
them
telling
those
present
how
they
had
triumphed
the
night
before
or
intended
to
triumph
on
a
future
occasion
some
of
the
greatest
oaths
i
have
ever
heard
were
uttered
by
these
men
while
discussing
religion
and
frequently
the
little
and
nervous
keeper
had
to
be
forcibly
prevented
from
jumping
at
his
burly
opponent
and
striking
him
the
drug
store
was
not
far
away
from
the
office
where
i
worked
and
whenever
loud
and
boisterous
talking
was
heard
in
that
direction
a
smile
went
round
for
we
knew
the
blacksmith
had
suddenly
come
upon
his
enemy
and
attacked
him
with
something
he
had
thought
up
while
at
his
work
i
never
knew
exactly
what
the
trouble
between
them
was
though
i
heard
enough
of
it
but
i
remember
that
it
had
some
reference
to
a
literal
resurrection
and
a
new
body
and
i
often
thought
it
queer
that
each
one
was
able
to
take
the
bible
and
establish
his
position
so
clearly
whenever
i
heard
the
blacksmith
talk
i
was
sure
that
the
druggist
was
wrong
but
when
the
druggist
called
upon
the
blacksmith
to
stop
right
there
and
began
his
argument
i
became
convinced
that
after
all
there
were
two
sides
to
the
question
these
two
men
as
well
as
most
of
the
others
were
members
of
a
church
known
then
as
the
campbellite
for
i
do
not
remember
that
there
was
an
infidel
or
unbeliever
in
the
place
there
were
a
great
many
backsliders
but
none
of
them
ever
questioned
religion
itself
though
they
could
never
agree
on
doctrine
it
has
occurred
to
me
since
that
if
one
of
them
had
thought
to
dispute
the
inspiration
of
the
bible
and
argued
about
that
the
people
would
have
been
entirely
happy
for
the
old
discussions
in
time
became
very
tiresome
the
people
regarded
religion
as
a
struggle
between
the
campbellite
church
and
the
devil
and
a
sensation
was
developed
one
evening
when
my
father
remarked
to
the
druggist
in
the
presence
of
the
usual
crowd
he
happened
to
be
in
the
place
on
an
errand
as
he
never
engaged
in
the
amusement
of
the
town
that
sprinkling
answered
every
purpose
of
baptism
the
druggist
became
very
much
excited
immediately
and
prepared
for
a
discussion
but
my
father
only
laughed
at
him
and
walked
away
the
next
sunday
however
he
preached
a
sermon
on
the
subject
in
the
and
attacked
the
town
s
religion
with
so
much
vigor
that
the
excitement
was
very
intense
most
of
the
citizens
of
twin
mounds
came
from
the
surrounding
country
and
a
favorite
way
of
increasing
the
population
was
to
elect
the
county
officers
from
the
country
but
after
their
terms
expired
a
new
set
moved
in
for
it
was
thought
they
became
so
corrupt
by
a
two
years
residence
that
they
could
not
be
trusted
to
a
the
town
increased
in
size
a
little
in
this
manner
for
none
of
these
men
ever
went
back
to
their
farms
again
though
they
speedily
lost
standing
after
they
retired
from
their
positions
many
others
who
left
their
farms
to
move
to
the
town
said
in
excuse
that
the
school
advantages
were
better
and
seemed
very
anxious
for
a
time
that
their
children
should
be
educated
but
once
they
were
established
in
twin
mounds
they
abused
the
school
a
great
deal
and
said
it
was
not
satisfactory
and
allowed
their
children
to
remain
away
if
they
were
so
inclined
there
was
the
usual
number
of
merchants
professional
men
mechanics
who
got
along
well
enough
but
i
never
knew
how
at
least
one
half
the
inhabitants
lived
some
of
them
owned
teams
and
farmed
in
the
immediate
vicinity
others
hauled
and
others
did
whatever
offered
but
they
were
all
poor
and
were
constantly
changing
from
one
house
to
another
these
men
usually
had
great
families
of
boys
who
grew
up
in
the
same
indifferent
fashion
and
drifted
off
in
time
nobody
knew
where
coming
back
occasionally
after
a
long
absence
and
with
money
to
rattle
in
their
pockets
but
none
of
them
ever
came
back
who
had
business
of
sufficient
importance
elsewhere
to
call
them
away
again
for
they
usually
remained
until
their
good
clothes
wore
out
the
delusion
of
their
respectability
was
broken
and
they
became
town
loafers
again
or
engaged
in
the
hard
pursuits
of
their
fathers
the
only
resident
of
twin
mounds
who
ever
distinguished
himself
ran
away
with
a
circus
and
never
came
back
for
although
he
was
never
heard
of
it
was
generally
believed
that
he
must
have
become
famous
in
some
way
to
induce
him
to
forego
the
pleasure
of
returning
home
in
good
clothes
and
swaggering
up
and
down
the
street
to
allow
the
people
to
shake
his
hand
this
class
of
men
never
paid
their
debts
and
to
get
credit
for
an
amount
was
equal
to
earning
it
to
their
way
of
thinking
and
a
new
merchant
who
came
in
did
a
great
business
until
he
found
them
out
i
have
said
they
never
paid
they
did
sometimes
but
if
they
paid
a
dollar
on
account
they
bought
three
or
four
times
that
amount
to
go
on
the
books
they
always
seemed
to
me
to
be
boys
yet
surprised
at
being
their
own
masters
and
only
worked
when
they
had
to
as
boys
do
they
engaged
in
boys
amusements
too
for
most
of
them
owned
packs
of
dogs
and
racehorses
and
it
was
one
of
their
greatest
accomplishments
to
drive
a
to
a
to
some
neighborhood
match
it
against
a
farmer
s
horse
threatened
with
speed
and
come
back
with
all
the
money
owned
in
that
direction
i
suppose
they
came
west
to
grow
up
with
the
country
like
the
rest
of
us
but
they
were
idle
where
they
came
from
and
did
not
improve
in
the
west
because
work
was
necessary
whereupon
the
thought
no
doubt
occurred
to
them
that
they
could
have
grown
rich
in
that
way
anywhere
a
few
of
them
were
away
most
of
the
time
i
never
knew
where
but
so
far
away
that
they
seldom
came
home
and
their
families
supported
themselves
as
best
they
could
but
were
always
expecting
the
husbands
and
fathers
to
return
and
take
them
away
to
homes
of
luxury
occasionally
news
came
that
they
were
killed
by
indians
and
occasionally
this
was
contradicted
by
the
certainty
that
they
were
locked
up
for
disreputable
transactions
or
hanged
whenever
a
twin
mounds
man
died
away
from
home
otherwise
than
honorably
it
was
always
said
that
he
had
been
killed
by
the
indians
all
of
this
and
much
more
i
learned
during
the
first
three
years
of
my
residence
there
which
were
generally
uneventful
and
without
incident
save
that
on
rare
occasions
i
was
permitted
to
visit
jo
and
agnes
at
fairview
who
made
so
much
of
me
that
i
dreaded
to
come
away
i
had
long
since
displaced
adams
and
jo
was
out
of
his
time
at
the
mill
and
for
more
than
a
year
had
been
receiving
wages
enabling
him
to
save
considerable
money
which
he
invested
in
his
enterprise
at
the
ford
with
a
steadfastness
for
which
i
his
best
friend
did
not
give
him
credit
he
was
engaged
now
to
be
married
to
mateel
shepherd
and
he
worked
and
studied
to
make
himself
worthy
of
her
barker
had
been
known
to
confess
that
jo
was
the
better
miller
of
the
two
i
believe
he
really
was
and
when
he
came
to
town
he
spent
more
of
his
time
in
examining
the
machinery
in
the
mills
on
the
river
than
in
visiting
me
and
it
was
plain
that
the
establishment
on
bull
river
would
not
satisfy
him
when
he
began
the
building
of
his
own
dad
erring
s
hands
had
improved
somewhat
during
the
three
years
and
the
great
piles
of
framed
timbers
lying
at
the
ford
now
were
his
work
but
jo
had
paid
him
from
his
earnings
as
much
as
he
would
take
these
were
hauled
from
the
woods
where
they
were
fashioned
by
jo
himself
on
odd
occasions
with
ox
teams
and
low
wagons
assisted
by
the
cheap
labor
which
abounded
in
winter
while
the
creek
was
low
he
had
laid
a
broad
foundation
for
his
dam
with
stones
so
large
that
a
great
many
men
were
necessary
to
handle
them
which
were
sunk
into
the
creek
and
the
succeeding
layers
fastened
to
them
by
a
process
he
had
invented
i
think
he
worked
there
a
little
every
week
during
the
three
years
assisted
by
young
men
he
hired
for
almost
nothing
and
there
was
system
and
order
in
everything
he
did
occasionally
it
happened
that
the
water
at
barker
s
was
too
high
or
too
low
to
run
the
mill
when
he
worked
on
his
own
enterprise
from
daylight
until
dark
living
at
his
father
s
house
barker
often
gave
him
the
half
of
one
day
and
all
of
the
next
when
trade
was
dull
and
these
opportunities
he
improved
to
the
very
best
advantage
every
time
i
went
to
fairview
i
visited
the
mill
and
it
was
always
growing
jo
made
a
good
deal
of
money
every
month
by
running
extra
time
which
opportunity
barker
delighted
to
give
him
and
often
after
he
had
worked
all
night
or
all
day
he
would
commence
again
and
work
half
of
his
employer
s
time
studying
his
books
when
everything
was
running
smoothly
his
ambition
had
become
noised
about
and
partly
because
a
mill
was
needed
in
that
part
of
the
country
and
partly
because
the
people
had
lately
grown
to
admire
jo
they
proposed
to
raise
him
a
certain
sum
of
money
to
be
returned
at
any
time
within
five
years
after
the
mill
should
commence
running
my
recollection
is
that
the
amount
was
three
or
four
hundred
dollars
and
i
have
always
believed
that
damon
barker
paid
lytle
biggs
out
of
his
own
pocket
to
solicit
subscriptions
to
the
fund
for
he
seemed
to
have
something
to
do
with
it
during
this
time
i
had
mastered
the
mystery
of
the
boxes
so
well
that
i
wondered
how
it
was
possible
i
had
puzzled
my
brain
over
them
they
seemed
so
simple
and
easy
and
if
i
improved
the
time
well
i
am
sure
it
was
due
to
the
kindly
encouragement
and
help
of
martin
who
was
not
only
a
very
clever
printer
but
an
intelligent
man
besides
it
had
always
been
a
part
of
his
work
i
believe
to
write
the
few
local
items
of
the
town
and
he
taught
me
to
help
him
making
me
do
it
my
way
first
and
then
after
he
had
explained
the
errors
i
wrote
them
all
over
again
if
i
employed
a
bad
sentence
or
an
inappropriate
word
he
explained
his
objections
at
length
and
i
am
certain
that
had
i
been
less
dull
i
should
have
become
a
much
better
writer
than
i
am
for
he
was
very
competent
to
teach
me
my
father
as
an
editor
was
earnest
and
vigorous
and
the
subjects
of
which
he
wrote
required
columns
for
expression
so
that
his
page
of
the
paper
was
always
full
i
spent
a
quite
recent
rainy
holiday
in
a
dusty
attic
looking
over
an
old
file
of
the
union
of
states
when
he
was
its
editor
and
was
surprised
at
the
ability
he
displayed
the
simple
and
honest
manner
in
which
he
discussed
the
questions
of
the
day
became
very
popular
for
he
always
advocated
that
which
was
right
and
there
was
always
more
presswork
to
do
every
week
which
he
seemed
to
regard
as
an
imposition
on
martin
who
had
formerly
had
that
hard
part
of
the
work
to
perform
and
on
the
plea
of
needing
exercise
he
early
began
to
run
the
press
himself
and
in
the
history
of
the
business
at
that
time
no
man
was
known
who
could
equal
him
in
the
rapid
and
steady
manner
in
which
he
went
about
it
soon
after
my
introduction
into
the
office
i
had
learned
to
ink
the
forms
so
acceptably
with
a
hand
roller
that
i
was
forced
to
keep
at
it
for
a
suitable
successor
could
not
be
found
but
at
last
we
found
a
young
man
who
had
a
passion
for
art
it
was
none
other
than
my
old
enemy
shorty
wilkinson
i
fought
him
regularly
every
week
during
the
first
year
of
my
residence
in
town
but
we
finally
agreed
to
become
friends
and
after
that
martin
and
i
spent
a
portion
of
the
two
press
days
of
the
week
in
adorning
our
page
with
paragraphs
of
local
happenings
or
rather
in
rambling
through
the
town
hunting
for
them
sometimes
we
invented
startling
things
at
night
and
spent
the
time
given
us
in
wandering
through
the
woods
like
idle
boys
bathing
and
fishing
in
the
streams
in
summer
and
visiting
the
in
early
spring
where
we
heard
many
tales
of
adventure
which
afterwards
appeared
in
print
under
great
headings
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
it
was
conducted
by
a
careful
and
industrious
man
and
the
great
number
of
law
advertisements
which
came
in
from
that
and
two
of
the
adjoining
counties
the
union
of
states
made
a
good
deal
of
money
and
certainly
it
was
improved
under
my
father
s
proprietorship
before
it
came
into
his
possession
it
was
conducted
by
a
man
who
had
ideas
but
not
talents
beyond
a
country
newspaper
who
regarded
it
as
a
poor
field
in
which
to
expect
either
reputation
or
money
but
my
father
made
it
as
readable
as
he
could
and
worked
every
day
and
night
at
something
designed
to
improve
it
the
result
was
that
its
circulation
rapidly
extended
and
the
business
was
very
profitable
his
disposition
had
not
changed
with
his
residence
except
that
he
turned
me
over
entirely
to
martin
and
a
room
had
been
fitted
up
in
the
building
where
the
paper
was
printed
for
our
joint
occupancy
where
we
spent
our
evenings
as
we
saw
fit
but
always
to
some
purpose
for
the
confidence
reposed
in
martin
was
deserved
from
my
mother
who
was
more
lonely
than
ever
in
the
stone
house
in
which
we
lived
i
learned
occasionally
that
the
rev
john
westlock
still
read
and
thought
far
into
every
night
into
the
room
in
which
he
slept
was
brought
every
evening
the
and
sitting
before
this
spread
out
to
its
full
size
he
read
wrote
or
thought
until
he
went
to
bed
which
was
always
at
a
late
hour
it
occurred
to
me
once
or
twice
in
an
indifferent
sort
of
way
that
a
man
who
had
no
greater
affairs
than
a
country
printing
office
and
a
large
amount
of
wild
land
constantly
increasing
in
value
had
reason
to
think
so
much
as
he
did
but
i
never
suspected
what
his
trouble
was
until
it
was
revealed
to
me
as
i
shall
presently
relate
when
i
rambled
through
the
town
at
night
and
passed
that
way
if
i
looked
in
at
his
window
which
was
on
the
ground
floor
he
was
oftener
thinking
than
reading
or
writing
leaning
back
in
his
chair
with
a
scowl
on
his
face
which
frightened
me
whether
the
procession
of
forbidden
pictures
was
still
passing
before
him
and
the
figures
accompanying
them
were
still
beckoning
will
never
be
known
until
the
great
book
of
men
s
actions
said
to
be
kept
in
heaven
is
opened
and
i
hope
that
those
who
are
permitted
to
look
at
the
writing
under
the
head
of
john
westlock
will
be
able
to
read
through
the
mercy
of
god
tempted
and
tried
but
almost
every
saturday
afternoon
he
drove
away
into
the
country
without
explanation
and
did
not
return
until
sunday
night
or
early
monday
morning
where
he
went
we
never
knew
but
we
supposed
he
had
gone
to
preach
in
some
of
the
country
churches
or
for
persons
who
came
into
the
office
through
the
week
spoke
in
a
way
which
led
us
to
believe
that
such
was
the
case
although
he
was
not
often
at
fairview
jo
told
me
but
he
heard
of
him
frequently
in
the
adjoining
neighborhoods
during
the
latter
part
of
the
second
year
of
our
residence
in
twin
mounds
my
father
came
home
one
monday
morning
in
an
unusually
bad
humor
and
though
he
went
away
occasionally
after
that
it
was
usually
late
in
the
evening
and
i
came
to
understand
somehow
that
he
did
not
preach
any
more
the
result
of
some
sort
of
a
misunderstanding
even
had
i
been
anxious
to
know
the
particulars
there
was
no
one
to
inform
me
as
no
one
seemed
to
know
and
in
a
little
while
i
ceased
to
think
about
it
entirely
for
he
at
once
gave
me
more
to
do
by
teaching
me
the
details
of
the
business
the
men
who
came
to
the
office
to
see
him
after
that
annoyed
him
and
made
him
more
irritable
therefore
he
taught
me
the
routine
of
his
affairs
that
i
might
relieve
him
of
them
we
all
usually
worked
together
but
after
this
he
took
whatever
he
had
to
do
into
the
room
where
martin
had
his
bed
and
when
the
people
came
in
i
was
expected
to
attend
to
them
from
my
going
into
the
bedroom
to
ask
him
questions
about
his
land
business
which
i
did
not
so
well
understand
it
came
to
be
believed
that
he
was
failing
in
health
and
his
old
friends
frequently
expressed
the
hope
that
he
would
soon
be
better
if
i
had
trouble
in
settling
with
any
one
he
came
out
impatiently
and
acted
as
if
he
would
like
to
pitch
the
man
into
the
street
for
his
affairs
were
always
straight
and
honest
and
there
was
no
occasion
for
trouble
frequently
he
would
propose
to
work
in
my
place
if
i
would
go
out
in
town
and
solicit
business
and
when
there
were
bills
to
collect
i
was
put
about
it
so
that
for
weeks
at
a
time
he
did
not
see
any
one
and
trusted
almost
everything
to
me
when
my
father
was
away
i
was
expected
to
stay
at
home
and
i
could
not
help
noticing
that
my
mother
was
growing
paler
and
weaker
and
that
the
old
trouble
of
which
she
had
spoken
to
jo
was
no
better
the
house
in
which
we
lived
was
built
of
square
blocks
of
stone
and
the
walls
were
so
thick
and
the
windows
so
small
that
i
used
to
think
of
her
as
a
prisoner
shut
up
in
it
the
upper
part
was
not
used
except
when
i
went
there
to
sleep
and
it
was
such
a
dismal
and
lonely
place
that
i
was
often
awakened
in
the
night
with
bad
dreams
but
i
always
had
company
for
i
found
her
sleeping
on
a
pallet
by
the
side
of
my
bed
as
though
she
was
glad
to
be
near
me
i
never
heard
her
come
or
go
away
but
if
i
awoke
in
the
night
i
was
sure
to
find
her
by
my
side
there
is
a
great
change
in
you
ned
she
said
to
me
one
evening
when
i
had
gone
to
stay
with
her
since
coming
to
i
replied
that
i
was
glad
to
hear
her
say
so
as
i
was
very
ignorant
when
i
went
into
the
office
to
work
the
rest
of
us
are
unchanged
she
said
we
are
no
happier
here
than
in
fairview
just
the
same
i
it
was
the
only
reference
she
had
ever
made
to
the
subject
to
me
and
i
did
not
press
it
for
i
feared
she
would
break
down
and
confess
the
sorrow
which
filled
her
life
a
great
many
times
afterwards
i
could
have
led
her
up
to
talk
about
it
fully
and
freely
i
think
but
i
dreaded
to
hear
from
her
own
lips
how
unhappy
she
really
was
had
i
those
days
to
live
over
how
often
are
those
words
said
and
written
as
though
there
is
a
consciousness
with
every
man
of
having
been
unwise
as
well
as
unhappy
in
his
youth
i
would
pursue
a
different
course
but
it
never
occurred
to
me
then
that
i
could
be
of
more
use
to
her
than
i
was
or
that
i
could
in
any
way
lessen
her
sorrow
she
never
regretted
that
i
no
longer
slept
in
the
house
nor
that
i
was
growing
as
cold
toward
her
as
my
father
which
must
have
been
the
case
so
i
never
knew
that
she
cared
much
about
it
indeed
i
interpreted
her
unhappiness
as
indifference
toward
me
and
it
had
been
that
way
since
i
could
remember
had
she
put
her
arms
around
me
and
asked
me
to
love
her
because
no
one
else
did
i
am
sure
i
should
have
been
devoted
to
her
but
her
quietness
convinced
me
that
she
was
so
troubled
in
other
ways
that
there
was
no
time
to
think
of
me
and
while
i
believe
i
was
always
kind
and
thoughtful
of
her
i
fear
i
was
never
affectionate
chapter
xvii
the
fellow
although
i
met
him
almost
every
day
i
never
cared
to
renew
my
acquaintance
with
clinton
bragg
the
dislike
was
evidently
mutual
for
while
he
never
came
in
my
way
i
knew
he
made
fun
of
me
as
he
did
of
every
one
else
and
i
believe
he
had
an
ill
word
for
whatever
i
did
or
attempted
although
it
was
said
that
he
drank
more
than
was
good
for
him
he
did
not
have
the
appearance
of
a
drunkard
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
when
he
was
drinking
he
was
anxious
that
everybody
know
it
and
that
he
drank
more
because
it
was
contemptible
and
depraved
than
because
he
had
an
appetite
a
few
of
the
sentimental
people
said
that
were
it
not
for
his
dissipating
he
could
greatly
distinguish
himself
and
that
he
was
very
talented
therefore
i
think
he
drank
as
an
apology
for
his
worthlessness
knowing
he
could
never
accomplish
what
the
people
said
he
could
if
he
remained
sober
he
probably
argued
that
if
he
kept
his
breath
smelling
with
liquor
he
would
only
have
to
answer
to
the
public
for
that
one
fault
receiving
at
the
same
time
a
large
amount
of
sympathy
which
a
better
man
would
have
rejected
whereas
if
he
kept
sober
he
would
be
compelled
to
answer
to
the
charge
of
being
an
insolent
loafer
and
a
worthless
vagabond
from
a
long
experience
with
it
i
have
come
to
believe
that
the
question
of
intemperance
has
never
been
treated
with
the
intelligence
which
has
distinguished
this
country
in
most
other
particulars
we
pet
drunkards
too
much
and
a
halo
of
sentimentality
surrounds
them
instead
of
the
disgust
and
contempt
they
deserve
if
a
man
is
a
noted
liar
or
a
noted
vagrant
society
allows
him
to
find
his
proper
level
and
reform
himself
since
no
one
else
can
do
it
for
him
but
if
he
drinks
too
much
great
numbers
of
men
and
women
who
are
perhaps
temperate
in
nothing
except
that
they
do
not
drink
attempt
to
reform
him
with
kindness
although
that
method
prevails
in
nothing
else
as
a
reason
why
he
should
not
dissipate
he
is
told
what
distinguished
positions
he
could
occupy
but
for
the
habit
and
while
this
is
the
facts
generally
are
that
the
fellow
is
entirely
worthless
whether
drunk
or
sober
the
young
man
who
practises
temperance
in
the
whiskey
and
other
particulars
because
it
is
necessary
in
his
ambition
to
be
of
use
to
himself
and
to
those
around
him
is
entirely
neglected
that
the
disgusting
pigs
who
swill
that
which
is
ruinous
to
health
mind
and
pocket
may
be
encouraged
and
who
perhaps
only
drink
for
the
poor
kind
of
attention
it
insures
them
and
from
being
told
of
it
so
often
they
come
to
believe
themselves
that
but
for
their
dissipation
they
would
be
wonderful
fellows
so
it
often
happens
that
their
egotism
is
even
more
detestable
than
their
maudlin
drunkenness
many
young
men
are
thus
led
into
the
false
notion
that
great
brains
feed
on
stimulants
and
regard
an
appetite
as
intellectual
the
same
mistaken
people
also
talk
too
much
about
the
allurements
and
pleasures
of
drink
of
the
gilded
palaces
where
drink
is
sold
and
of
its
pleasing
effects
causing
young
men
and
boys
who
would
otherwise
never
have
thought
of
it
to
be
seized
with
an
uncontrollable
desire
to
try
the
experiment
for
themselves
although
there
is
nothing
more
certain
than
that
all
of
this
is
untrue
they
visit
these
places
to
begin
with
because
they
have
been
warned
so
frequently
against
them
and
before
they
find
out
which
they
are
certain
to
sooner
or
later
that
whiskey
is
man
s
enemy
in
every
particular
and
his
friend
in
nothing
that
the
gilded
palaces
in
which
it
is
sold
are
low
dens
kept
by
men
whose
company
is
not
desirable
that
the
reputed
pleasure
in
the
cup
is
a
myth
and
that
drinking
is
an
evidence
of
depravity
as
plainly
marked
as
idleness
and
viciousness
they
form
the
habit
and
become
saloon
loafers
i
firmly
believe
that
hundreds
of
young
men
become
drunkards
by
misrepresentation
of
this
sort
whereas
the
truth
is
easier
told
and
would
prove
more
effective
in
keeping
them
away
the
first
step
in
a
career
of
dissipation
is
not
the
first
glass
as
is
sometimes
asserted
but
a
cultivation
of
saloon
society
there
is
nothing
to
do
in
a
place
where
drink
is
sold
no
other
amusement
or
excuse
for
being
there
than
to
drink
gamble
and
gossip
and
when
a
man
learns
to
relish
the
undesirable
company
common
to
such
places
the
liquor
habit
follows
as
a
matter
of
course
but
not
before
it
is
an
effort
for
most
men
to
drink
whiskey
even
after
they
have
become
accustomed
to
its
use
it
is
naturally
disgusting
to
every
good
quality
and
every
good
thought
it
jars
every
healthy
nerve
as
it
is
poured
down
the
throat
it
looks
hot
and
devilish
in
the
bottle
and
gurgles
like
a
demon
s
laugh
while
it
is
being
poured
out
and
until
the
young
men
of
the
country
are
taught
that
drinking
is
low
and
vicious
rather
than
intellectual
we
can
not
hope
for
a
reform
in
this
grave
matter
i
believe
that
familiarity
with
it
breeds
contempt
for
i
have
noticed
that
very
few
drunkard
s
sons
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
their
fathers
and
the
men
who
sell
it
seldom
drink
it
most
drunkards
are
such
notorious
liars
that
little
can
be
told
from
their
confessions
but
if
accurate
statistics
could
be
collected
it
would
no
doubt
turn
out
that
most
men
having
the
habit
formed
it
because
they
were
particularly
warned
against
it
to
say
to
a
man
that
he
shall
not
drink
creates
within
him
a
strong
desire
to
drink
to
excess
and
prohibitory
laws
generally
increase
rather
than
decrease
the
consumption
of
liquor
because
of
this
strange
peculiarity
we
regulate
other
evils
and
admit
they
can
not
be
blotted
out
but
with
strange
inconsistency
we
insist
that
liquor
of
every
kind
must
be
driven
from
the
face
of
the
earth
that
to
regulate
such
a
horrible
evil
is
a
compromise
with
the
devil
and
that
efforts
for
its
extermination
only
are
worthy
of
temperate
men
and
women
the
most
convincing
argument
for
reform
in
any
particular
is
necessity
when
a
man
says
to
himself
i
must
quit
this
habit
or
starve
or
i
can
never
obtain
a
position
of
trust
in
business
or
a
place
of
respectability
in
society
until
i
convince
the
people
of
my
intelligence
and
manhood
by
reforming
a
habit
which
is
the
most
contemptible
as
well
as
injurious
of
all
other
habits
he
is
on
the
right
road
and
will
in
time
accomplish
a
victory
over
himself
and
the
best
thing
society
can
do
for
him
however
heartless
it
may
seem
is
to
let
him
alone
during
his
reformation
only
visiting
upon
him
its
severe
contempt
when
he
falls
for
if
the
fall
is
hard
and
disagreeable
he
will
be
more
careful
the
next
time
when
a
man
disgraces
himself
in
any
other
way
we
insist
that
he
must
be
humiliated
as
sending
him
to
jail
for
petty
larceny
or
to
public
work
for
vagrancy
but
when
he
becomes
a
disgusting
beastly
drunkard
we
tell
him
in
confidence
that
he
is
not
to
blame
and
that
his
enemies
the
are
responsible
the
man
who
sells
the
pistol
or
the
poison
is
not
to
blame
for
the
suicide
nor
is
the
man
who
sells
the
whiskey
to
blame
for
the
drunkard
it
is
no
more
remarkable
that
men
drink
too
much
than
that
men
eat
too
much
and
die
before
their
time
of
dyspepsia
the
one
we
regard
as
a
glutton
and
despise
him
that
he
does
not
use
the
knowledge
god
has
given
him
to
better
advantage
but
the
other
is
fondled
and
pitied
until
he
is
made
to
feel
almost
comfortable
in
his
disgrace
the
result
is
that
men
are
oftener
cured
of
excessive
eating
than
of
excessive
drinking
we
never
think
of
punishing
the
grocer
for
selling
unhealthy
but
palatable
food
but
we
are
very
severe
on
the
men
who
sell
palatable
but
demoralizing
drink
men
have
frequently
been
cured
of
kleptomania
by
a
term
in
jail
and
of
lying
and
loafing
by
the
contempt
of
the
people
among
whom
they
live
and
the
same
rule
applied
to
drunkards
would
be
equally
satisfactory
in
its
results
because
temperance
is
right
too
many
insist
that
it
must
prevail
although
the
experience
of
ages
proves
that
it
never
was
and
never
will
become
a
common
virtue
we
might
reason
with
equal
goodness
of
heart
that
because
children
are
pretty
and
healthy
they
should
never
be
stricken
down
with
disease
and
die
although
our
sorrowing
hearts
tell
us
that
the
reverse
is
the
rule
in
everything
else
we
profit
from
experience
but
we
seem
to
have
learned
nothing
from
the
past
in
dealing
with
intemperance
the
methods
used
for
its
suppression
now
are
exactly
the
same
as
were
used
hundreds
of
years
ago
although
we
know
them
to
be
ineffective
as
a
sensible
people
as
a
people
desiring
the
good
of
the
unfortunate
we
can
not
afford
to
practise
methods
which
we
know
beforehand
will
be
of
no
avail
intemperance
is
growing
too
rapidly
to
admit
of
an
unsatisfactory
pretence
that
we
have
discharged
our
duty
and
while
the
theory
advanced
by
the
writer
of
this
may
not
be
the
best
one
it
is
certain
that
the
one
generally
adopted
is
wrong
for
the
people
are
disheartened
and
discouraged
because
with
all
their
work
they
have
accomplished
nothing
clinton
bragg
was
this
sort
of
a
drunkard
and
drank
whiskey
for
no
other
reason
than
that
everybody
said
it
wasn
t
good
for
him
it
was
known
that
he
always
drank
large
quantities
of
water
after
using
his
bottle
as
if
the
liquor
had
set
fire
to
his
throat
and
the
water
was
intended
to
put
it
out
while
i
never
knew
him
to
be
helplessly
intoxicated
he
was
frequently
under
the
influence
of
his
bottle
or
pretended
to
be
although
i
have
seen
him
sober
very
suddenly
and
i
always
thought
he
was
dissatisfied
that
the
people
did
not
talk
more
about
his
dissipation
as
they
did
of
fin
wilkinson
s
the
town
drunkard
who
was
often
on
the
streets
in
danger
of
being
run
over
by
wagons
every
two
or
three
months
he
received
an
allowance
of
money
from
his
father
which
he
expended
selfishly
but
lavishly
as
long
as
it
lasted
but
for
a
few
weeks
before
his
money
came
and
while
he
was
without
it
he
was
a
more
decent
fellow
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
had
he
been
compelled
to
make
his
own
way
in
the
world
he
might
in
time
have
developed
into
a
respectable
man
but
as
it
was
he
had
no
friends
and
spent
the
mornings
of
his
days
in
sleeping
and
his
nights
in
aimless
excursions
over
the
country
riding
a
horse
as
mean
and
vicious
as
himself
a
decent
man
would
not
have
owned
the
animal
for
he
had
a
reputation
for
biting
and
kicking
but
bragg
lavished
upon
him
the
greatest
attention
and
was
delighted
to
hear
occasionally
that
he
had
injured
a
stable
boy
it
was
a
pleasure
to
bragg
to
know
that
his
horse
laid
back
his
ears
in
anger
at
the
approach
of
any
one
in
the
street
or
on
the
road
and
his
master
teased
him
for
hours
to
cultivate
his
devilish
disposition
where
he
went
on
these
excursions
nobody
ever
knew
except
that
i
knew
he
frequently
rode
by
barker
s
mill
as
if
on
his
way
to
the
shepherds
galloping
back
the
same
way
at
a
late
hour
to
create
the
impression
that
he
was
so
popular
there
that
he
only
got
away
with
difficulty
though
i
believe
he
usually
rode
aimlessly
about
to
be
different
from
other
men
for
while
he
often
rode
that
way
it
was
only
on
rare
occasions
that
he
went
to
the
house
of
the
minister
bragg
was
educated
and
when
he
talked
to
the
town
people
at
all
it
was
to
point
out
their
ignorance
which
he
did
with
a
bitter
tongue
if
he
was
seated
in
front
of
the
usual
loitering
places
on
a
summer
evening
which
he
sometimes
did
because
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
he
made
everybody
uncomfortable
by
intently
watching
for
opportunity
to
insolently
point
out
mistakes
and
if
he
ever
read
or
studied
at
all
it
was
for
this
purpose
occasionally
there
came
to
the
town
a
traveller
who
was
his
equal
in
information
who
beat
him
in
argument
and
threatened
to
whip
him
for
an
insolent
dog
which
afforded
the
people
much
satisfaction
i
remember
a
commercial
traveller
who
sold
the
merchants
nearly
all
their
goods
because
he
once
threw
a
plate
of
soup
in
bragg
s
face
at
the
hotel
table
and
then
leading
him
out
into
the
yard
by
the
ear
gave
him
a
sound
beating
but
i
do
not
remember
what
the
occasion
of
the
difficulty
between
them
was
though
it
was
probably
no
more
than
his
ordinary
impudence
he
had
an
office
and
apartments
over
a
leather
store
a
few
doors
above
the
place
where
i
worked
in
front
of
which
there
was
a
porch
and
he
sat
out
upon
this
when
the
weather
was
pleasant
for
hours
at
a
time
smoking
cigars
and
spitting
spitefully
into
the
street
the
only
man
i
ever
knew
who
visited
his
rooms
was
the
leather
dealer
who
called
on
bragg
once
every
three
months
to
collect
his
rent
it
was
a
part
of
the
town
gossip
that
this
man
said
the
rooms
were
splendidly
furnished
but
always
darkened
with
rich
and
heavy
curtains
at
the
windows
and
that
it
was
full
of
stuffed
snakes
lizards
bats
and
other
hideous
things
that
his
was
a
human
skull
and
that
a
grinning
skeleton
hung
against
the
wall
which
rattled
and
wildly
swung
its
arms
and
legs
every
time
a
draft
or
a
visitor
came
in
at
the
door
it
was
also
related
that
by
means
of
ingenious
strings
he
made
the
skeleton
shake
or
nod
its
head
and
point
with
its
arms
and
i
have
imagined
that
when
he
was
in
his
apartments
he
employed
himself
in
causing
the
figure
to
nod
its
head
in
response
to
the
assertion
that
clinton
bragg
was
a
fine
fellow
or
shake
it
violently
when
asked
if
clinton
bragg
was
a
worthless
dog
as
the
people
said
occasionally
people
who
had
lines
to
run
knocked
at
his
door
in
response
to
the
sign
c
bragg
engineer
but
even
if
he
was
at
home
he
would
not
let
them
in
for
he
had
no
intention
of
walking
over
the
prairie
in
the
hot
sun
when
he
put
out
the
sign
i
never
knew
of
his
doing
anything
in
his
line
although
he
might
have
been
a
great
deal
employed
and
finally
no
one
applied
there
for
admission
except
the
saddler
for
his
rent
and
a
lame
negro
who
swept
and
cleaned
his
apartments
although
it
was
quite
generally
believed
that
the
devil
called
on
him
every
bad
night
chapter
xviii
the
mill
at
erring
s
ford
during
the
latter
part
of
a
certain
week
a
little
more
than
three
years
after
we
removed
to
the
town
i
was
given
a
holiday
and
determined
at
once
to
spend
it
in
fairview
for
i
had
not
seen
jo
in
a
great
many
weeks
nor
agnes
in
as
many
months
i
remember
i
earned
it
by
working
at
night
by
the
light
of
candles
for
a
long
while
and
that
a
certain
carpenter
s
son
read
the
copy
while
i
set
the
type
while
another
boy
kept
the
night
bugs
away
with
a
fan
it
was
a
part
of
the
contract
with
my
father
that
for
the
extra
work
i
was
to
have
the
use
of
his
horses
in
addition
to
the
vacation
both
of
which
i
fully
earned
and
martin
understood
the
situation
so
well
that
he
said
if
i
did
not
get
back
until
monday
he
would
see
that
the
work
was
not
behind
i
started
very
early
in
the
morning
and
the
road
led
over
gentle
hills
and
through
light
woods
for
a
few
miles
when
the
great
prairie
began
which
ended
at
erring
s
ford
it
was
a
very
pretty
country
and
though
we
frequently
referred
to
it
in
the
union
of
states
as
the
garden
spot
of
the
world
i
knew
it
was
not
necessarily
true
for
every
paper
coming
in
exchange
to
the
office
said
exactly
the
same
thing
of
the
different
localities
in
which
it
was
published
but
it
pleased
the
people
who
did
not
see
the
exchanges
and
who
no
doubt
regarded
it
as
a
very
neat
compliment
it
looked
unusually
attractive
that
morning
and
in
riding
slowly
along
i
admired
it
so
much
that
i
did
not
notice
the
approach
of
a
horseman
who
was
riding
very
rapidly
and
going
in
the
same
direction
when
he
came
so
close
that
the
noise
of
the
animal
s
hoofs
attracted
my
attention
i
turned
and
saw
that
it
was
lytle
biggs
who
had
by
this
time
become
an
old
acquaintance
for
he
frequently
wrote
letters
to
the
paper
in
a
very
bad
hand
signed
pro
bono
publico
citizen
or
farmer
and
which
i
was
usually
compelled
to
put
in
type
he
was
a
very
sociable
fellow
and
i
was
pleased
with
the
prospect
of
his
company
i
said
as
much
to
which
he
replied
if
you
have
no
objection
i
will
tie
the
horse
behind
and
ride
with
you
for
i
detest
riding
on
a
horse
s
back
it
may
do
for
exercise
as
you
swing
on
the
advice
of
a
physician
but
i
am
surprised
i
did
not
have
better
sense
than
to
attempt
it
with
a
serious
intention
of
i
replied
that
i
should
be
delighted
and
when
he
got
down
i
could
not
help
wondering
how
he
ever
got
on
he
was
such
a
little
man
and
the
horse
so
uncommonly
large
as
he
climbed
into
the
buggy
and
took
a
seat
beside
me
i
noticed
he
was
as
faultlessly
dressed
as
ever
and
that
he
seemed
to
be
growing
shorter
and
thinner
you
are
going
to
jo
erring
s
of
course
he
said
after
seeing
that
the
horse
led
well
it
is
a
remarkable
coincidence
so
am
i
suppose
you
are
not
old
enough
to
know
it
but
it
only
happens
once
in
a
lifetime
that
when
you
are
walking
a
long
road
or
riding
on
a
horse
s
back
which
i
think
is
worse
you
overtake
an
buggy
going
in
the
same
direction
and
containing
but
one
person
although
you
meet
a
great
many
vehicles
going
the
other
way
it
is
on
the
same
principle
that
if
you
go
up
stairs
to
strike
a
light
and
take
but
one
match
it
is
certain
to
go
out
but
if
you
take
half
a
dozen
the
first
one
answers
every
his
good
spirits
were
rapidly
returning
by
reason
of
release
from
the
horse
s
back
and
after
finishing
this
speech
he
occupied
himself
for
a
while
in
brushing
the
dust
from
his
clothing
with
a
small
wisp
he
took
from
his
pocket
i
am
on
my
way
to
see
jo
erring
with
reference
to
the
mill
he
began
at
once
i
have
charge
of
the
fund
being
raised
to
help
him
and
i
shall
be
able
to
report
that
the
amount
is
subscribed
i
am
acting
for
damon
barker
as
you
may
or
may
not
happen
to
know
and
although
our
friend
believes
the
fairview
farmers
are
very
enthusiastic
to
help
him
they
are
really
very
slow
and
i
have
had
some
difficulty
in
convincing
them
that
it
was
to
their
interest
i
shall
also
recommend
that
he
build
the
mill
as
soon
as
possible
there
is
no
reason
why
it
should
drag
through
another
year
and
that
is
the
promise
i
gave
in
securing
these
he
significantly
tapped
a
almost
as
large
as
himself
in
an
outside
pocket
and
which
no
doubt
contained
the
obligations
to
pay
certain
sums
of
money
at
an
agreed
date
he
always
carried
this
book
in
a
conspicuous
way
and
handled
it
as
though
it
contained
great
sums
of
money
but
as
he
looked
through
it
for
something
i
saw
there
was
nothing
in
it
except
the
obligations
a
great
many
newspaper
scraps
a
few
old
letters
one
or
two
postage
stamps
and
a
piece
of
court
plaster
i
don
t
mind
confessing
to
you
biggs
continued
with
delightful
candor
that
i
flattered
them
into
it
in
case
you
do
not
become
disgusted
with
the
ignorance
which
renders
such
a
thing
possible
you
can
flatter
men
into
anything
when
i
go
into
a
new
neighborhood
to
organize
an
alliance
i
get
the
prompt
assistance
of
every
man
i
meet
by
telling
him
that
i
can
t
hope
to
do
any
thing
without
his
aid
as
he
has
the
popular
confidence
and
the
people
will
follow
wherever
he
leads
you
are
a
man
of
intelligence
i
say
you
can
readily
understand
what
i
have
to
offer
and
will
see
its
benefit
at
once
but
your
neighbors
are
slower
and
i
will
not
attempt
an
organization
here
without
your
that
kind
of
argument
never
fails
and
as
i
talk
to
all
of
them
in
the
same
way
there
is
a
great
deal
of
enthusiasm
each
one
imagining
that
the
others
went
into
it
on
his
recommendation
i
worked
up
the
mill
subscription
in
that
i
doubt
if
this
statement
was
true
for
the
people
originated
the
idea
themselves
but
to
illustrate
a
great
truth
biggs
did
not
hesitate
to
tell
a
great
lie
i
make
a
great
deal
of
money
in
organizing
alliances
but
sometimes
i
think
of
going
out
of
the
business
because
i
meet
so
many
silly
men
that
it
disgusts
me
and
i
become
ashamed
of
my
sex
but
i
suppose
every
business
has
that
draw
back
for
every
man
i
have
ever
talked
with
was
of
the
opinion
that
his
business
developed
more
silly
men
more
contemptible
men
and
more
mean
men
than
any
other
calling
and
i
am
forced
to
conclude
that
these
qualities
are
so
common
that
they
are
met
with
when
he
spoke
of
retiring
from
the
business
of
organizing
alliances
i
was
about
to
say
that
publishing
a
newspaper
collected
about
all
the
objectionable
men
within
reach
but
from
what
he
said
afterwards
i
judged
the
observation
would
not
be
well
received
as
if
he
understood
that
i
was
about
to
say
something
which
he
did
not
allow
he
continued
i
was
about
to
say
however
when
you
interrupted
me
i
had
not
spoken
at
all
that
the
way
to
get
rich
is
to
go
in
debt
and
work
out
therefore
i
shall
recommend
that
jo
erring
complete
his
mill
at
once
no
matter
if
he
goes
in
debt
he
has
health
and
can
pay
it
the
people
of
the
country
through
which
we
are
passing
believe
it
the
best
to
pay
as
you
go
that
party
over
in
the
field
for
instance
is
ploughing
his
corn
with
a
single
shovel
plough
whereas
there
are
dealers
in
town
who
would
readily
take
his
note
for
a
cultivator
with
four
shovels
and
a
riding
seat
his
library
no
doubt
consists
of
a
book
warning
him
against
counting
his
chickens
before
they
are
hatched
as
pointless
a
suggestion
as
i
ever
heard
in
my
life
by
the
way
for
why
do
we
set
eggs
if
not
to
bring
forth
chickens
but
it
is
regarded
as
fine
logic
here
the
man
will
die
some
of
these
days
with
his
single
shovel
plough
his
slab
house
his
cow
his
two
horses
and
his
handful
of
land
paid
for
worth
altogether
from
three
to
seven
hundred
dollars
but
if
he
has
a
neighbor
who
sets
a
good
many
hens
with
care
and
counts
the
number
of
chickens
they
can
reasonably
be
expected
to
hatch
he
will
attend
the
funeral
in
a
carriage
and
look
at
his
remains
through
i
had
regarded
this
principle
as
a
very
good
one
but
he
convinced
me
that
i
was
mistaken
as
usual
for
i
could
never
dispute
his
philosophy
until
i
had
thought
over
it
a
day
or
two
when
its
sophistry
seemed
quite
clear
i
had
remarked
of
biggs
before
that
he
seemed
to
understand
what
was
in
my
mind
and
attack
it
i
was
thinking
that
the
man
he
was
talking
about
his
name
was
mcjohn
and
a
local
curiosity
because
his
voice
was
uncertain
and
jumped
from
a
high
falsetto
to
a
guttural
bass
had
the
reputation
of
being
the
hardest
working
man
in
fairview
when
my
companion
said
i
never
knew
a
man
i
believe
who
didn
t
boast
occasionally
that
he
worked
harder
than
his
neighbor
i
wonder
it
never
occurs
to
them
that
it
is
to
their
discredit
unless
they
are
more
prosperous
than
any
of
those
around
them
for
if
their
neighbors
work
less
and
succeed
as
well
or
better
it
is
an
indication
that
they
have
more
sense
i
have
no
doubt
that
mcjohn
as
he
spends
his
time
in
ploughing
a
field
which
could
be
done
in
the
time
with
common
sense
and
a
cultivator
thinks
that
no
other
man
s
lot
is
as
hard
as
his
and
that
he
is
a
martyr
to
hard
work
before
i
became
a
philosopher
when
i
was
a
fool
in
short
i
boasted
that
no
man
worked
as
hard
as
i
did
but
now
i
boast
that
no
man
works
so
little
but
simply
because
a
man
says
he
is
the
man
in
the
country
it
does
not
follow
that
it
is
true
every
traveller
who
crosses
the
ocean
says
that
the
captain
who
had
been
at
sea
continuously
for
thirty
years
came
into
the
cabin
during
the
storm
and
said
it
was
the
worst
he
had
ever
experienced
i
have
no
doubt
the
captains
say
so
there
is
no
reason
why
sea
captains
should
not
lie
as
well
as
other
men
but
only
to
impress
the
passengers
with
their
remarkable
skill
in
managing
the
vessel
under
such
critical
circumstances
you
may
have
noticed
that
every
winter
is
the
coldest
ever
known
and
every
summer
the
hottest
the
people
seem
to
expect
picnics
in
december
and
skating
in
july
but
the
facts
are
that
it
is
always
cold
in
december
and
always
warm
in
i
would
have
made
oath
if
necessary
that
i
had
heard
biggs
many
a
time
complaining
of
the
excessively
hot
and
cold
days
and
declaring
that
there
was
never
before
anything
like
it
the
people
here
learn
nothing
by
experience
he
proceeded
since
i
have
lived
in
the
west
every
spring
has
been
made
gloomy
by
the
lamentations
of
the
farmers
that
crops
were
ruined
but
just
before
the
crops
were
burned
up
as
the
tooth
came
just
before
the
doctor
killed
the
boy
the
rains
come
and
the
crops
do
very
well
you
will
find
that
the
men
who
carry
the
fate
of
the
country
around
on
their
shoulders
do
not
get
on
so
well
as
the
country
i
have
always
found
it
safe
to
trust
the
country
to
take
care
of
itself
for
the
country
usually
does
very
we
were
riding
on
the
high
prairie
now
with
fairview
church
in
sight
and
the
little
man
regarded
the
big
building
with
a
show
of
the
contempt
i
had
seen
him
exhibit
on
looking
at
big
men
although
the
fact
is
as
old
as
the
world
itself
biggs
waved
his
hand
around
majestically
to
give
me
to
understand
that
although
the
world
was
very
large
and
very
old
he
was
perfectly
familiar
with
every
part
of
it
it
does
not
seem
to
be
generally
known
that
the
weather
is
governed
by
cycles
to
illustrate
it
was
very
rainy
and
wet
two
years
ago
it
was
rainy
and
wet
last
year
but
not
so
rainy
and
wet
as
the
year
before
there
has
been
plenty
of
rain
this
summer
but
not
so
much
as
during
the
two
previous
years
next
year
will
be
so
dry
as
to
excite
comment
but
still
very
fair
for
crops
the
year
after
that
and
the
year
following
there
will
probably
be
a
partial
drouth
but
the
seventh
year
which
completes
the
cycle
will
be
a
general
and
complete
drouth
the
winter
following
will
be
very
mild
or
very
severe
but
in
any
event
the
next
summer
will
be
extremely
wet
again
to
be
followed
by
the
seven
years
of
decreasing
rain
i
have
mentioned
and
the
drouth
the
seventh
year
i
don
t
know
how
it
is
in
the
east
it
is
as
i
have
stated
in
the
west
it
would
seem
that
everybody
ought
to
be
familiar
with
this
fact
but
they
are
not
hard
times
and
good
times
run
in
cycles
the
same
way
and
the
panic
and
the
drouth
are
about
the
same
distance
apart
though
fortunately
they
never
come
together
for
strange
as
it
may
seem
the
panics
come
in
seasons
of
great
crop
prosperity
and
times
are
sometimes
very
good
when
crops
are
very
bad
it
is
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
get
rich
after
you
are
familiar
with
these
cycle
theories
you
have
only
to
invest
your
money
when
times
are
hard
when
everybody
believes
the
country
is
down
and
can
never
get
up
again
in
a
year
or
two
however
the
country
will
get
up
and
shake
itself
and
you
find
your
investments
doubled
it
is
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
and
i
am
surprised
there
are
so
many
poor
men
we
might
as
well
all
be
rich
if
we
would
take
advantage
of
the
opportunities
around
i
wondered
to
myself
why
biggs
himself
was
so
poor
since
he
had
discovered
the
secret
of
riches
and
thought
some
of
putting
the
question
to
him
but
he
didn
t
give
me
opportunity
for
immediately
he
went
on
to
explain
when
i
came
to
the
country
i
was
foolish
enough
to
buy
land
because
everybody
else
was
buying
and
paid
too
much
i
warn
you
against
this
mistake
never
buy
anything
when
there
is
a
brisk
demand
for
it
for
the
price
will
inevitably
be
too
high
but
buy
when
no
one
else
is
buying
and
sell
when
there
is
a
disposition
on
the
part
of
everybody
else
to
buy
i
bought
when
i
should
have
sold
in
other
words
for
i
was
not
then
a
philosopher
result
the
tract
is
worth
no
more
than
what
i
paid
for
it
since
then
i
have
never
had
money
enough
at
one
time
to
take
advantage
of
my
knowledge
and
am
still
poor
agnes
says
the
principal
objection
to
you
is
that
you
are
young
but
i
tell
her
that
you
will
outgrow
it
therefore
i
hope
you
will
make
use
of
this
important
suggestion
avoid
the
mistakes
of
others
let
your
neighbors
try
the
doubtful
experiments
and
benefit
by
the
result
a
great
many
men
are
only
of
use
to
teach
others
by
their
failures
but
never
repeat
their
by
this
time
we
had
arrived
at
the
ford
and
as
i
had
hoped
jo
was
at
work
at
his
mill
aided
by
a
half
dozen
stout
young
men
of
the
neighborhood
since
i
had
visited
the
place
last
jo
had
completed
the
dam
and
the
foundation
and
the
timbers
were
being
raised
several
were
already
up
and
held
by
long
ropes
until
the
others
could
be
put
in
position
and
fastened
i
noticed
that
jo
was
helping
in
everything
and
directing
with
the
judgment
and
good
sense
of
a
man
of
twice
his
years
his
father
was
also
assisting
and
it
seemed
important
that
all
the
frames
be
put
up
before
night
for
they
were
very
busy
jo
gayly
waved
his
hand
to
me
from
the
high
place
to
which
he
had
climbed
to
pin
a
timber
and
after
he
had
come
down
again
he
shook
hands
with
me
in
his
old
hearty
way
and
said
he
hoped
i
would
understand
it
was
not
neglect
if
he
kept
at
his
work
for
he
had
determined
to
push
the
mill
to
completion
as
speedily
as
possible
as
it
was
necessary
to
prevent
the
building
of
another
one
further
up
the
stream
during
the
forenoon
i
learned
from
gran
erring
from
biggs
and
from
jo
himself
that
my
father
had
given
jo
the
money
promised
two
or
three
hundred
dollars
that
barker
had
loaned
him
a
small
amount
and
that
with
the
sum
he
had
saved
this
was
deemed
sufficient
to
complete
the
building
ready
for
the
machinery
which
was
to
be
purchased
with
the
money
raised
in
the
neighborhood
and
a
mortgage
on
the
completed
mill
that
jo
had
quit
at
barker
s
though
he
was
there
occasionally
and
helped
when
he
could
that
he
was
to
be
married
to
mateel
the
day
before
christmas
and
that
the
mill
must
be
in
operation
for
the
fall
business
that
he
had
written
for
the
machinery
detailing
the
terms
on
which
he
wanted
it
and
that
it
would
be
shipped
at
once
that
a
deed
to
the
little
farm
had
been
delivered
to
him
in
consideration
of
certain
payments
in
money
and
promises
to
pay
certain
amounts
annually
during
the
lifetime
of
his
father
and
mother
and
that
after
the
mill
was
completed
they
would
move
to
a
country
below
fairview
a
step
they
had
long
contemplated
as
they
had
relatives
there
leaving
the
house
of
hewn
logs
to
be
fixed
over
for
the
occupancy
of
jo
and
mateel
that
jo
now
slept
at
home
in
the
middle
bed
and
that
he
expected
to
be
so
busy
the
next
few
months
that
he
had
written
mateel
a
note
saying
that
if
she
wished
to
see
him
during
that
time
to
stop
at
the
little
shed
below
the
mill
on
her
way
to
church
on
sunday
where
she
would
find
him
at
work
and
always
glad
to
see
her
all
of
this
pleased
me
exceedingly
and
caused
me
to
watch
opportunity
to
shake
the
brave
fellow
s
hand
occasionally
as
he
hurried
past
me
which
seemed
very
agreeable
to
him
although
i
doubt
if
he
understood
what
it
meant
as
i
watched
the
men
at
their
work
i
saw
that
jo
had
a
troubled
weary
look
and
i
thought
for
the
first
time
that
his
strength
might
not
prove
equal
to
his
ambition
for
i
knew
that
there
were
yet
several
years
of
hard
work
ahead
of
him
but
as
i
saw
how
eagerly
he
went
at
everything
as
though
the
delay
was
more
disagreeable
than
the
work
i
was
reassured
and
felt
that
he
would
accomplish
all
he
had
set
out
to
do
i
do
not
remember
who
told
me
but
i
learned
from
some
source
that
mateel
often
complained
of
being
lonely
and
of
having
nothing
to
do
and
i
thought
that
this
industrious
man
must
soon
overtake
and
pass
her
in
learning
and
ability
and
that
she
would
regret
in
her
future
that
she
had
not
improved
the
opportunities
of
womanhood
as
he
had
improved
the
opportunities
of
manhood
while
mateel
was
a
pretty
and
amiable
woman
there
was
not
the
depth
to
her
that
jo
was
acquiring
and
i
wondered
if
it
ever
occurred
to
her
that
jo
would
finally
be
a
man
worthy
to
be
the
husband
of
any
woman
a
man
and
and
expecting
a
return
for
everything
he
gave
i
wondered
if
she
ever
thought
jo
had
been
raised
at
a
hard
school
and
would
tire
of
simple
amiability
if
he
was
anything
at
all
he
was
an
example
of
what
effort
would
do
and
i
thought
the
day
would
come
when
he
could
not
understand
why
mateel
was
not
his
equal
although
she
was
older
and
had
every
opportunity
while
he
had
none
i
thought
that
as
jo
had
been
friendless
all
his
life
he
would
hope
for
a
great
deal
of
considerate
affection
from
his
wife
and
that
he
would
be
disappointed
if
he
were
compelled
to
continue
his
old
habit
of
being
thoughtful
of
every
one
but
having
to
regret
that
no
one
was
thoughtful
of
him
i
wondered
if
mateel
knew
that
jo
was
no
longer
the
rough
awkward
boy
she
had
met
during
her
first
week
in
fairview
and
that
he
was
now
a
growing
vigorous
man
ahead
of
all
his
companions
in
ability
and
intelligence
and
that
every
year
he
would
throw
away
old
ideas
for
better
ones
jo
had
told
her
in
his
manly
love
that
she
was
a
perfect
woman
and
that
it
would
require
his
efforts
for
a
lifetime
to
become
her
equal
and
i
think
she
was
pleased
with
this
and
believed
it
i
am
certain
she
never
said
to
jo
that
he
was
a
remarkable
fellow
and
that
he
deserved
more
credit
than
she
could
give
him
for
his
manly
love
for
her
which
was
no
more
than
the
truth
but
rather
thought
herself
worthy
of
the
toil
he
had
undergone
not
that
she
was
selfish
perhaps
but
because
jo
had
told
her
so
or
maybe
she
had
never
thought
about
it
at
all
except
that
jo
was
very
fond
of
her
and
was
anxious
to
please
her
i
would
have
given
a
great
deal
to
know
that
she
frequently
gave
jo
a
word
of
encouragement
but
if
she
ever
did
he
never
told
me
of
it
and
for
this
reason
i
was
convinced
that
she
never
did
in
the
afternoon
i
rode
over
to
fairview
church
where
agnes
was
teaching
the
school
and
although
i
half
expected
to
find
the
building
surrounded
by
young
men
on
their
knees
with
proposals
of
marriage
begging
her
to
accept
one
of
the
number
and
permit
the
others
to
drown
their
grief
in
the
nearest
deep
water
only
the
smaller
boys
and
girls
were
in
attendance
the
older
ones
being
at
home
busy
with
the
summer
s
work
agnes
was
prettier
than
ever
i
thought
and
although
i
knew
the
style
had
only
reached
twin
mounds
the
week
before
she
wore
a
dress
cut
in
what
was
then
known
as
the
princess
pattern
she
greeted
me
with
so
much
genuine
pleasure
that
i
was
ashamed
to
acknowledge
that
i
had
been
in
the
neighborhood
since
morning
and
felt
guilty
that
i
had
not
driven
directly
to
fairview
and
leading
me
through
the
rows
of
benches
she
seated
me
in
a
chair
in
front
of
her
rude
desk
which
the
children
had
adorned
with
wild
flowers
i
sat
there
nearly
an
hour
before
school
was
dismissed
very
uncomfortable
from
being
looked
at
so
steadily
by
the
scholars
two
or
three
of
the
meek
s
family
who
had
come
on
since
i
left
fairview
were
there
and
i
readily
picked
them
out
by
their
white
heads
and
good
humor
i
could
tell
who
nearly
all
of
them
were
by
characteristics
of
one
kind
and
another
though
i
did
not
know
any
of
them
but
there
was
one
boy
evidently
the
son
of
a
renter
lately
arrived
for
i
could
not
imagine
who
he
was
who
made
me
particularly
uncomfortable
by
mimicking
me
when
i
was
not
looking
he
created
a
great
deal
of
merriment
i
remember
by
pasting
his
hair
down
on
his
forehead
as
mine
was
i
had
visited
the
barber
s
just
before
starting
and
the
barbers
oiled
and
combed
their
customers
hair
then
as
they
do
now
for
barbers
never
improve
and
i
caught
him
puffing
at
a
intimating
that
in
the
community
where
i
lived
the
cigar
habit
was
evidently
common
i
wore
a
very
flashy
necktie
and
he
made
one
out
of
the
back
of
a
blue
to
represent
it
which
he
pasted
on
his
chin
then
on
his
neck
and
then
on
his
breast
i
thought
of
going
out
into
the
yard
to
get
rid
of
him
but
i
knew
the
impudent
boy
would
mimic
my
walk
and
make
me
ridiculous
again
so
i
stood
it
in
silence
until
the
children
were
called
up
in
a
row
for
the
final
spelling
class
in
which
i
was
invited
to
participate
and
where
i
triumphed
over
my
enemy
by
correctly
spelling
all
the
words
he
missed
then
they
all
read
a
chapter
in
chorus
from
the
bible
and
were
dismissed
i
was
afraid
the
renter
s
boy
would
stay
around
until
i
handed
agnes
into
the
buggy
but
he
walked
to
the
door
in
a
manner
which
intimated
that
i
was
and
disappeared
with
a
whoop
after
they
had
gone
agnes
sat
down
at
a
desk
near
the
door
where
she
had
bid
the
last
one
and
looked
at
me
curiously
are
you
glad
to
see
me
i
asked
not
knowing
what
else
to
say
yes
she
replied
with
her
pretty
laugh
but
you
don
t
seem
to
be
the
same
boy
who
came
to
school
here
a
few
years
ago
you
have
grown
so
much
that
you
seem
like
a
stranger
instead
of
an
old
she
laughed
merrily
at
my
look
of
astonishment
and
pretended
to
be
frightened
when
i
went
over
and
sat
beside
her
why
didn
t
you
say
when
you
came
in
she
asked
this
school
is
dismissed
i
am
a
friend
of
the
teacher
i
expected
you
to
say
that
but
instead
you
waited
patiently
until
i
should
dismiss
it
myself
when
i
knew
ned
westlock
he
was
a
boy
of
spirit
but
i
am
as
glad
to
see
you
as
i
can
be
this
is
my
week
at
theodore
meek
s
and
you
may
drive
me
there
as
slowly
as
your
horses
can
i
am
sure
i
felt
like
dismissing
the
school
when
i
came
in
but
i
never
thought
of
it
i
never
felt
more
at
a
loss
in
my
life
for
something
to
say
and
sat
looking
at
her
in
a
sort
of
blind
astonishment
blushing
like
a
child
i
wanted
to
tell
her
how
much
pleasure
the
contemplation
of
this
visit
had
afforded
me
but
i
could
not
and
finally
tiring
of
being
stared
at
she
got
up
and
went
to
collecting
the
books
and
other
articles
she
intended
to
take
home
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
to
do
so
i
went
out
and
brought
the
buggy
around
to
the
door
and
after
helping
her
in
as
awkwardly
as
i
had
stared
at
her
we
drove
away
in
my
desperation
i
could
only
confess
that
i
had
been
thinking
for
weeks
how
polished
and
agreeable
i
would
be
in
my
manner
on
meeting
her
but
that
her
pretty
face
and
easy
way
had
scared
it
all
out
of
me
that
i
came
to
fairview
expressly
to
see
her
and
that
i
hoped
there
would
never
be
a
misunderstanding
between
us
with
reference
to
our
friendship
there
never
will
be
she
said
in
her
innocent
and
earnest
way
putting
her
arm
through
mine
and
seeming
reassured
and
pleased
there
could
be
no
misunderstanding
between
you
and
me
and
there
never
has
been
why
should
there
be
she
spoke
as
though
i
were
still
a
boy
though
i
was
now
larger
than
she
was
and
nearly
sixteen
i
felt
sure
she
would
always
treat
me
as
a
boy
no
difference
how
old
i
became
as
we
drove
along
slowly
i
thought
that
if
a
stranger
should
see
us
he
would
think
we
were
lovers
but
agnes
evidently
did
not
think
of
it
for
she
confessed
her
friendship
for
me
in
a
hundred
different
ways
which
i
am
sure
she
would
not
have
done
had
she
thought
of
me
as
her
lover
she
was
in
unusual
spirits
and
though
i
felt
very
proud
to
think
that
i
was
the
cause
of
it
i
thought
that
the
arrival
of
a
pretty
baby
of
which
she
had
once
been
fond
would
have
made
her
as
happy
i
hinted
gravely
once
or
twice
that
we
were
growing
older
and
that
we
could
not
always
be
children
but
she
would
only
say
that
we
were
friends
and
enjoyed
the
friendship
i
think
she
was
content
with
that
and
did
not
look
beyond
it
i
had
almost
forgotten
it
she
said
when
we
neared
the
meek
s
premises
but
your
old
friend
damon
barker
comes
to
see
me
every
week
now
at
the
school
sometimes
he
comes
at
noon
at
other
times
in
the
evening
but
he
never
fails
to
appear
at
least
once
a
week
the
first
time
he
came
the
children
were
dismissed
for
the
day
i
was
alone
and
although
he
is
a
man
i
was
not
afraid
of
him
and
he
walked
part
way
home
with
me
since
then
he
comes
frequently
and
although
he
pretends
that
he
only
stops
in
while
passing
i
believe
he
comes
all
the
way
from
the
mill
to
see
while
barker
was
a
little
old
i
was
not
surprised
that
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
agnes
i
only
wondered
that
every
one
did
not
but
after
i
thought
more
of
it
i
became
convinced
that
wise
good
sensible
barker
only
admired
her
sweet
pretty
face
and
was
not
in
love
what
does
he
say
to
you
i
asked
nothing
except
to
question
me
about
the
school
and
make
sensible
suggestions
with
reference
to
its
management
he
never
tires
in
listening
to
me
but
says
little
i
then
told
her
what
i
knew
about
barker
his
curious
home
and
how
much
i
admired
him
i
was
glad
that
he
had
taken
an
interest
in
her
for
he
would
see
that
she
was
never
subjected
to
wrong
nor
injustice
from
any
source
and
agnes
was
greatly
pleased
when
i
said
that
when
opportunity
offered
we
would
visit
him
at
the
mill
together
the
enthusiasm
in
the
meek
s
family
over
my
arrival
reminded
me
of
the
feeling
in
a
when
a
popular
speaker
gets
up
for
they
were
all
at
home
and
made
quite
an
army
the
boys
who
had
not
grown
much
except
in
reminded
me
of
the
on
the
twin
mounds
hills
which
perceptibly
grew
older
but
not
larger
and
the
meek
and
his
wife
welcomed
me
as
though
i
were
an
old
friend
who
had
gone
out
into
the
world
and
greatly
distinguished
himself
before
i
was
fairly
in
the
house
it
was
arranged
that
i
should
remain
until
after
supper
and
return
by
moonlight
to
my
grandfather
s
which
suited
me
very
well
as
i
had
not
yet
seen
enough
of
agnes
i
had
noticed
before
that
there
was
always
so
much
to
do
around
the
meek
s
house
that
members
of
his
family
no
sooner
finished
their
day
s
work
than
they
went
to
bed
and
in
the
preparation
for
my
entertainment
they
were
busier
than
ever
so
that
agnes
and
i
were
alone
for
an
hour
which
we
both
enjoyed
though
we
were
not
so
easy
as
we
pretended
to
be
for
i
caught
her
looking
stealthily
at
me
and
i
am
quite
sure
i
was
often
admiring
her
when
i
started
to
return
to
the
mill
which
i
did
after
a
long
religious
service
and
a
light
supper
agnes
proposed
to
ride
a
short
distance
with
me
and
then
i
brought
her
back
and
she
went
part
way
with
me
again
so
that
it
was
quite
late
when
i
finally
got
away
the
country
being
familiar
to
me
i
drove
through
the
field
paths
to
shorten
the
distance
and
hurried
along
as
rapidly
as
i
could
for
i
knew
they
would
be
waiting
for
me
as
i
came
out
into
the
main
road
and
was
closing
a
gate
a
horseman
dashed
by
me
riding
toward
the
mill
and
i
saw
with
some
surprise
that
it
was
clinton
bragg
on
the
wicked
vicious
horse
i
followed
leisurely
preferring
to
avoid
him
but
probably
knowing
who
it
was
he
stopped
beside
the
road
allowing
me
to
pass
so
closely
that
i
could
have
touched
him
with
my
hand
had
i
wished
then
he
would
run
by
as
if
to
frighten
my
horses
and
this
performance
he
repeated
so
many
times
that
i
would
have
pulled
him
off
his
horse
and
beaten
him
had
i
the
strength
when
i
arrived
at
the
ford
he
was
there
before
me
allowing
his
vicious
horse
to
drink
below
the
dam
and
while
i
stood
on
the
hill
looking
at
him
he
rode
out
and
galloped
off
through
the
dark
woods
as
though
he
could
see
better
by
night
than
by
day
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
the
place
where
he
disappeared
would
be
a
favorable
one
for
a
murder
and
that
if
bragg
had
a
desperate
enemy
it
would
not
be
safe
for
him
to
ride
through
such
a
dark
wood
at
night
i
believe
he
wanted
me
to
know
he
had
taken
the
road
to
the
shepherds
with
the
hope
that
i
would
tell
jo
and
annoy
him
but
for
once
he
went
to
his
trouble
for
nothing
for
when
i
went
into
the
house
jo
was
sound
asleep
in
the
middle
bed
and
resting
easily
and
quietly
chapter
xix
the
fall
of
rev
john
westlock
one
sunday
morning
in
the
fall
of
the
year
after
i
had
got
out
of
bed
and
dressed
myself
i
was
still
occupying
a
room
in
connection
with
martin
in
the
building
where
the
business
of
printing
was
carried
on
i
found
a
letter
on
my
desk
addressed
in
my
father
s
writing
and
after
martin
had
gone
out
i
sat
down
to
read
it
the
first
line
startled
me
for
it
read
as
follows
my
dear
son
when
this
falls
into
your
hands
i
shall
be
travelling
the
broad
road
i
have
so
often
warned
others
against
an
outcast
and
disgraced
in
the
sight
of
god
and
man
for
i
am
going
away
and
shall
never
come
back
i
shall
not
attempt
to
tell
you
why
i
am
going
away
for
i
do
not
know
myself
except
that
i
am
discontented
as
i
am
which
has
been
my
condition
since
i
can
remember
i
don
t
know
that
i
believe
the
step
i
am
taking
will
make
me
more
contented
but
i
know
i
can
not
remain
as
i
am
for
the
devil
has
complete
possession
of
me
and
leads
me
to
do
that
which
is
most
disgraceful
and
wicked
whether
you
know
it
or
not
is
not
important
to
the
purposes
of
this
letter
but
for
seven
years
i
have
been
infatuated
with
the
woman
who
is
my
companion
in
this
wicked
business
and
she
has
been
the
temptation
against
which
i
have
fought
and
prayed
but
in
spite
of
my
efforts
and
prayers
it
has
grown
on
me
until
i
am
no
longer
a
man
if
you
still
have
confidence
in
my
truthfulness
i
need
only
say
that
i
fought
this
infatuation
with
all
my
strength
but
i
am
weaker
than
you
know
and
after
a
life
devoted
to
principle
i
am
adrift
on
an
unknown
sea
for
as
god
is
my
witness
this
is
my
first
offence
in
a
package
in
my
desk
with
your
name
on
the
wrapper
will
be
found
the
deeds
to
all
i
possess
together
with
notes
and
accounts
and
full
instructions
as
to
their
management
the
money
i
take
with
me
is
so
small
in
amount
that
it
will
never
be
missed
if
you
manage
well
and
work
well
in
a
few
years
you
can
almost
rejoice
that
i
went
away
as
i
did
for
all
the
property
i
leave
you
is
advancing
in
value
and
will
in
time
make
you
independent
if
you
attend
to
it
although
it
may
seem
odd
that
i
give
you
advice
which
i
can
not
accept
myself
i
desire
that
you
be
industrious
and
honest
you
can
be
successful
in
no
other
way
and
you
are
now
the
sole
support
and
comfort
of
your
mother
who
i
can
attest
was
very
good
to
you
when
you
were
helpless
that
she
has
not
been
more
affectionate
with
you
since
you
have
grown
up
has
been
partly
my
fault
for
i
do
not
believe
in
affection
whether
i
was
right
or
wrong
does
not
matter
now
as
i
seem
to
have
been
wrong
in
everything
else
perhaps
i
was
in
that
i
do
not
know
whether
you
partake
of
my
discontent
or
not
your
mother
was
always
contented
with
her
home
and
with
whatever
fortune
brought
her
and
i
hope
you
are
like
her
in
this
but
if
you
are
not
it
is
only
a
question
of
time
when
you
will
travel
the
same
road
i
am
on
for
no
one
constituted
as
i
am
can
become
a
good
husband
a
good
citizen
or
a
good
man
i
wonder
that
i
held
out
as
long
as
i
did
and
it
is
the
only
thing
i
can
think
of
to
my
credit
that
i
did
not
take
this
step
years
ago
no
one
can
ever
know
what
a
struggle
i
have
had
against
temptation
or
how
humiliated
i
was
when
i
found
that
i
must
give
up
after
all
and
become
the
subject
of
scandal
among
the
small
people
i
despise
and
although
i
know
that
no
man
ever
deserved
pity
more
than
i
do
now
i
am
certain
that
there
is
not
one
who
will
extend
to
me
that
small
favor
to
tell
the
truth
seems
to
have
been
as
much
a
part
of
my
nature
as
discontent
therefore
i
assure
you
with
my
last
words
that
since
i
was
old
enough
to
remember
i
have
been
as
unhappy
as
it
was
possible
for
a
man
to
be
there
has
never
been
a
favorable
circumstance
connected
with
my
history
i
think
i
never
did
a
thing
in
my
life
that
it
was
not
distasteful
and
that
which
i
am
about
to
do
is
most
distasteful
of
all
though
i
can
not
help
it
i
am
not
going
away
with
the
hope
of
being
more
contented
than
i
have
been
for
i
do
not
expect
it
discontent
is
my
disease
and
this
is
merely
a
natural
stage
of
it
i
have
complaint
to
make
against
no
one
but
myself
no
one
has
driven
me
away
and
no
one
has
tempted
me
but
i
go
because
i
can
not
remain
as
i
am
i
can
not
explain
to
you
what
i
mean
by
such
a
strange
assertion
but
it
is
true
i
am
running
away
from
myself
my
health
is
good
my
business
prosperous
my
family
everything
that
a
reasonable
man
could
desire
but
in
spite
of
this
i
am
so
nervous
wretched
and
unreasonable
that
the
sight
of
my
home
the
sight
of
you
the
greetings
of
people
i
meet
fill
me
with
desperation
and
wickedness
i
believe
that
were
i
compelled
to
remain
here
another
week
i
should
murder
somebody
i
don
t
know
who
anybody
and
for
no
other
reason
than
that
i
can
not
control
myself
i
have
carefully
investigated
my
own
mind
fearing
i
had
lost
my
reason
but
my
brain
is
healthy
and
active
it
is
discontent
inexplicable
and
monstrous
and
horrible
beyond
expression
when
i
remember
how
discontented
i
have
been
in
the
past
though
favorably
situated
i
tremble
to
think
what
it
must
be
in
the
future
when
i
shall
have
my
disgrace
and
crime
to
remember
in
addition
to
it
but
perhaps
it
will
serve
to
hasten
the
end
and
relieve
me
of
a
life
which
i
never
desired
and
which
i
would
have
rid
the
world
of
years
ago
but
for
the
reason
that
i
was
afraid
your
father
john
westlock
i
have
a
recollection
of
feeling
faint
and
sick
after
reading
the
letter
and
when
i
started
up
to
go
home
i
remember
that
i
staggered
like
a
drunken
man
and
reeled
along
the
street
in
such
a
manner
that
those
whom
i
passed
surely
thought
i
was
returning
from
a
night
s
debauch
my
first
thought
was
that
the
best
thing
i
could
do
was
to
give
the
office
to
martin
and
take
my
mother
and
leave
the
country
too
before
any
one
knew
of
the
disgrace
but
when
i
remembered
the
advice
in
the
letter
with
reference
to
the
business
i
knew
it
was
his
deliberate
judgment
that
i
should
stay
and
live
it
down
and
he
must
have
thought
of
it
a
great
deal
a
thousand
disturbing
thoughts
passed
through
my
mind
as
i
went
along
and
once
when
i
went
into
an
old
and
vacant
house
to
avoid
meeting
a
party
of
people
who
were
coming
toward
me
the
first
feeling
of
faintness
returned
so
strong
that
i
was
compelled
to
lie
down
on
a
heap
of
straw
and
rubbish
my
greatest
dread
in
it
all
was
to
break
the
news
to
my
unhappy
mother
and
trying
to
brace
myself
with
the
thought
that
i
was
now
entrusted
with
grave
responsibilities
and
no
longer
a
boy
dependent
on
the
advice
of
another
i
passed
down
the
street
and
into
the
house
after
considerable
search
i
found
my
mother
seated
in
a
low
chair
in
the
kitchen
as
i
had
seen
her
a
hundred
times
before
but
for
some
reason
i
could
not
explain
it
then
nor
can
i
now
i
felt
that
she
had
sat
there
all
night
and
that
she
knew
that
he
had
gone
there
was
a
certain
timid
frightened
look
in
her
eyes
when
i
came
in
an
inexpressible
grief
in
her
manner
and
so
much
sorrow
in
the
tears
which
came
afresh
at
sight
of
me
which
convinced
me
that
i
had
nothing
to
tell
her
and
i
learned
afterwards
that
he
had
told
her
what
he
had
written
me
before
leaving
and
that
he
had
shaken
hands
with
her
on
parting
and
begged
her
not
to
be
distressed
my
first
action
was
to
pull
down
all
the
blinds
at
the
windows
and
lock
all
the
doors
for
i
was
determined
that
no
one
should
enter
the
house
that
day
and
i
hurriedly
carried
in
a
supply
of
wood
and
water
as
though
we
were
to
live
that
way
a
good
many
days
or
that
we
should
live
in
the
house
forever
without
seeing
any
one
as
the
day
wore
away
i
found
my
determination
increasing
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
though
i
tried
to
rally
my
mother
she
would
say
nothing
finally
i
gently
forced
her
to
leave
the
low
chair
and
lie
down
where
she
covered
her
head
and
sobbed
the
livelong
day
though
i
read
the
letter
over
a
great
many
times
having
gone
to
one
of
the
upper
rooms
for
the
purpose
where
i
could
see
the
people
passing
and
looking
wonderingly
at
the
house
to
see
it
shut
up
so
tight
i
could
make
nothing
out
of
it
further
than
that
the
rev
john
westlock
had
run
away
taking
tremaine
with
him
and
that
he
had
been
infatuated
with
her
for
seven
years
a
circumstance
of
which
i
had
not
the
remotest
suspicion
until
that
day
i
knew
now
that
on
his
visits
to
the
country
he
met
this
woman
at
some
convenient
place
but
beyond
that
and
the
fear
once
expressed
by
barker
that
his
religion
would
prove
an
unfortunate
thing
for
him
i
was
puzzled
to
understand
it
further
than
the
letter
had
explained
i
knew
now
that
the
trouble
which
caused
him
to
quit
preaching
and
to
seclude
himself
from
callers
at
the
office
related
to
the
woman
but
i
had
never
suspected
it
before
for
i
had
never
tried
to
explain
his
thoughtfulness
believing
it
was
simply
his
way
and
that
his
father
had
been
a
thinking
man
before
him
he
was
a
man
of
such
excellent
sense
that
suspicion
would
not
attach
to
him
particularly
suspicion
of
weakness
in
religion
or
morality
and
i
only
thought
of
it
to
become
more
puzzled
before
night
i
came
to
the
conclusion
though
it
gave
me
a
sad
heart
that
the
sooner
the
community
was
made
aware
of
the
matter
the
sooner
would
its
gossiping
and
conjecturing
cease
and
when
night
was
setting
in
i
hailed
a
boy
who
was
passing
and
sent
a
note
to
martin
requesting
him
to
come
to
the
house
he
came
soon
after
when
i
explained
everything
to
him
and
read
the
letter
which
he
heard
with
great
surprise
i
then
requested
him
to
go
wherever
there
was
a
crowd
that
evening
and
tell
it
to
the
end
that
the
people
might
discuss
it
through
the
night
as
i
preferred
that
course
to
a
suspense
of
several
weeks
for
we
could
have
kept
it
from
them
that
long
on
one
pretext
and
another
martin
approved
of
this
idea
though
he
was
too
much
surprised
to
say
much
else
and
when
he
went
out
i
saw
him
stop
people
on
the
street
and
talk
with
them
and
who
at
once
looked
up
at
the
house
and
seemed
greatly
surprised
no
lights
were
lit
in
the
house
that
night
and
i
spent
the
hours
in
wandering
through
the
vacant
rooms
in
wondering
what
the
people
were
saying
about
it
how
they
would
feel
with
reference
to
my
continuing
the
business
and
how
they
explained
it
all
frequently
i
went
into
the
room
where
my
mother
was
lying
down
and
she
was
still
for
such
a
long
time
that
i
hoped
she
was
oblivious
to
her
trouble
in
sleep
but
in
waiting
to
assure
myself
of
it
before
retiring
i
heard
her
sob
in
such
a
pitiful
manner
that
i
resumed
my
walk
through
the
lonely
rooms
and
listened
again
to
the
echoes
of
my
own
footsteps
i
spent
my
evenings
at
home
after
my
father
s
disappearance
at
first
from
necessity
because
my
mother
needed
me
there
and
because
i
had
work
to
do
but
i
gradually
grew
to
like
it
and
regretted
when
i
had
to
be
away
my
mother
was
much
changed
and
broken
by
her
desertion
and
if
i
read
far
into
the
night
which
i
often
did
for
my
education
was
indifferent
and
i
found
a
certain
amount
of
knowledge
indispensable
in
my
daily
work
she
sat
beside
me
employed
in
knitting
or
mending
if
i
wrote
something
i
thought
was
very
good
i
am
certain
now
i
never
did
i
read
it
to
her
if
i
found
a
paragraph
in
a
book
or
newspaper
which
i
thought
surprising
or
strange
i
read
that
but
while
she
always
listened
attentively
she
had
no
comments
to
offer
indeed
i
think
there
were
weeks
together
when
she
did
not
speak
to
me
at
all
except
to
call
me
in
the
morning
at
the
hour
i
told
her
i
should
like
to
get
up
or
to
inquire
after
my
small
wants
at
first
the
neighbors
thought
it
a
kindness
to
keep
the
house
full
of
callers
believing
her
to
be
lonely
but
they
at
last
discovered
that
it
would
be
a
greater
kindness
to
leave
her
alone
which
they
afterwards
did
so
it
came
about
that
we
lived
a
lonely
life
occasionally
martin
came
in
the
evening
to
sit
an
hour
and
a
few
times
agnes
was
a
visitor
to
the
gloomy
house
but
these
visits
were
so
far
apart
that
we
seemed
to
see
no
one
at
all
sometimes
i
took
her
out
for
a
drive
and
on
these
occasions
she
would
perceptibly
revive
and
say
that
this
or
that
place
had
changed
since
last
she
saw
it
but
of
her
trouble
she
never
spoke
at
all
one
pleasant
sunday
i
drove
on
the
road
to
fairview
thinking
to
call
on
jo
at
the
mill
but
she
gently
touched
the
lines
and
said
not
to
fairview
so
i
turned
around
and
drove
another
way
before
my
father
went
away
he
dealt
a
great
deal
in
wild
land
taking
stock
of
every
kind
in
payment
and
i
still
kept
a
pair
of
strong
and
fleet
horses
which
had
belonged
to
him
and
of
which
he
was
very
proud
at
first
because
i
could
not
sell
them
for
the
price
they
were
worth
and
lately
because
i
had
grown
to
like
them
they
were
very
rapid
in
harness
and
when
we
rode
out
my
mother
enjoyed
more
than
anything
else
the
excitement
of
passing
other
teams
speaking
many
kind
words
for
dan
and
she
took
great
interest
also
in
seeing
that
they
were
well
cared
for
and
though
i
was
afterwards
offered
a
good
price
for
them
i
kept
them
at
considerable
expense
and
trouble
because
she
seemed
to
take
an
interest
in
nothing
else
her
condition
was
so
lonely
that
i
became
more
of
a
son
than
i
had
ever
been
before
and
tried
always
to
be
careful
of
her
wants
she
reciprocated
this
with
kindness
and
attention
but
i
can
not
say
with
affection
when
i
went
to
my
bed
at
night
i
always
left
her
sitting
in
her
chair
and
after
i
had
retired
it
was
her
custom
to
come
softly
up
the
stairs
to
see
if
i
was
comfortable
if
it
was
cold
she
tucked
the
covering
about
me
as
if
i
were
yet
a
child
and
i
remember
now
i
do
not
believe
i
thought
of
it
then
that
she
talked
to
me
more
at
these
times
than
at
any
other
as
if
the
darkness
removed
a
restraint
perhaps
she
felt
a
disgrace
in
the
presence
of
her
son
that
his
parents
had
treated
him
so
indifferently
and
only
felt
easy
when
he
could
not
see
her
face
some
men
remember
their
mothers
from
their
kisses
but
i
remember
mine
by
the
gentle
manner
in
which
she
smoothed
the
covering
of
my
bed
at
night
and
i
grew
so
accustomed
to
it
that
i
could
not
have
gone
to
sleep
without
it
after
this
was
done
she
lingered
about
the
room
as
long
as
she
could
find
excuse
frequently
referring
to
subjects
of
which
i
had
spoken
in
the
evening
and
then
went
slowly
down
the
stairs
how
she
passed
the
night
i
never
knew
but
i
never
found
her
in
bed
frequently
i
thought
to
go
into
her
room
at
midnight
to
see
if
she
were
awake
but
in
waiting
for
the
hour
i
fell
asleep
if
i
came
home
late
at
night
whether
she
expected
me
or
not
i
found
her
up
and
often
when
a
slight
complaint
made
me
wakeful
and
restless
i
found
her
by
my
side
offering
me
water
or
some
simple
remedy
from
the
woman
who
came
to
the
house
to
work
through
the
day
but
who
slept
at
home
i
learned
that
my
mother
frequently
lay
down
in
her
room
during
the
day
and
probably
slept
so
i
think
that
generally
she
did
not
close
her
eyes
at
night
nor
go
to
bed
if
i
advised
with
her
in
reference
to
my
father
s
affairs
there
was
really
no
need
of
it
for
he
left
them
in
excellent
shape
with
full
instructions
to
me
and
she
knew
nothing
about
them
she
listened
attentively
but
the
details
seemed
to
tire
her
occasionally
a
man
would
intimate
that
my
father
had
not
credited
a
payment
on
an
account
or
a
note
and
appealing
to
her
she
would
say
your
father
was
honorable
in
business
the
man
is
mistaken
and
so
it
turned
out
if
i
told
her
of
my
own
affairs
she
was
equally
attentive
but
seemed
to
be
satisfied
with
my
course
and
had
no
suggestions
to
offer
i
hoped
to
hear
her
say
i
was
doing
well
or
that
the
business
did
not
miss
its
founder
but
if
she
thought
it
she
kept
it
to
herself
i
believe
that
she
always
thought
it
possible
that
her
husband
would
tire
of
his
fancy
and
coming
back
to
her
poor
and
old
they
would
finish
their
lives
together
perhaps
she
never
went
to
bed
at
night
because
she
was
always
expecting
his
knock
at
the
door
and
remained
up
to
assure
him
that
he
was
welcome
she
believed
that
a
man
of
his
sturdy
honest
principles
could
not
be
content
wandering
aimlessly
about
ashamed
to
own
his
name
and
his
country
so
the
vigils
through
the
long
nights
were
kept
up
he
would
not
come
during
the
day
when
he
would
meet
familiar
and
accusing
faces
at
every
turn
but
at
night
when
the
town
was
quiet
and
the
people
were
asleep
therefore
there
was
always
a
light
in
his
old
room
and
his
deserted
but
forgiving
wife
was
always
waiting
to
hear
his
step
in
the
street
and
his
knock
on
the
door
the
people
of
the
town
frequently
came
down
the
little
street
which
led
past
the
house
to
look
at
the
light
which
was
always
burning
and
which
cast
its
rays
out
into
the
darkness
like
a
kindly
star
they
told
the
story
of
the
light
to
strangers
in
pitying
whispers
and
many
of
them
believed
that
the
patience
of
the
lonely
watcher
would
be
rewarded
at
last
by
the
return
of
the
unhappy
wanderer
the
business
under
my
management
continued
to
be
profitable
partly
because
martin
and
i
gave
it
a
great
deal
of
attention
and
partly
because
it
was
without
opposition
martin
was
really
a
very
superior
man
and
together
we
did
very
well
making
improvements
as
the
money
was
earned
and
extending
the
business
whenever
it
was
possible
i
was
at
first
inclined
to
feel
that
i
could
never
recover
from
the
disgrace
of
my
father
s
action
but
after
biggs
assured
me
that
it
was
ignorant
conceit
to
suppose
that
the
people
had
nothing
else
to
do
than
to
think
of
my
small
affairs
that
every
family
had
a
private
history
and
that
ours
was
no
worse
than
hundreds
of
others
that
i
now
had
opportunity
to
make
a
reputation
for
myself
having
a
gift
of
a
considerable
property
to
start
with
and
that
so
far
as
i
was
personally
concerned
my
father
s
action
was
really
a
benefit
i
took
a
better
view
of
it
and
felt
that
if
i
conducted
the
business
creditably
and
took
good
care
of
my
mother
the
people
would
be
more
apt
to
speak
of
me
favorably
than
if
i
moped
around
during
the
first
few
weeks
a
great
many
of
my
father
s
staunch
friends
came
into
the
office
and
announced
that
they
would
not
believe
the
report
that
there
had
been
foul
play
but
to
these
i
read
the
letter
whereupon
they
went
away
very
much
puzzled
and
without
saying
a
word
these
men
and
there
was
a
great
number
of
them
encouraged
me
in
carrying
on
the
paper
in
every
way
they
could
and
as
they
were
of
the
class
which
makes
public
opinion
they
were
of
great
benefit
to
me
it
was
never
known
where
the
two
met
how
they
left
the
country
or
what
direction
they
took
i
heard
through
jo
that
before
the
disappearance
of
my
father
tremaine
had
been
away
from
home
several
days
but
as
this
was
a
common
circumstance
no
attention
was
paid
to
it
we
learned
by
degrees
that
their
names
had
long
been
connected
with
suspicious
gossip
but
they
seemed
to
have
been
very
discreet
for
the
matter
was
always
a
mystery
chapter
xx
two
hearts
that
beat
as
one
the
rev
john
westlock
went
away
in
the
latter
part
of
september
and
from
that
time
to
the
day
before
christmas
a
period
of
three
months
i
did
not
visit
fairview
as
i
dreaded
the
questions
of
the
people
for
one
thing
and
was
very
busy
for
another
but
jo
was
to
be
married
on
the
of
december
and
nothing
would
have
kept
me
away
with
the
exception
that
he
wrote
me
a
letter
saying
that
he
believed
barker
was
pleased
at
the
disappearance
of
his
sister
i
had
not
even
heard
directly
from
him
much
less
seen
his
good
honest
face
though
i
knew
the
mill
was
steadily
progressing
of
which
fact
we
made
appropriate
mention
in
the
columns
of
the
union
of
we
had
a
sort
of
understanding
that
as
we
should
both
be
very
busy
during
the
summer
we
would
put
off
a
meeting
until
his
wedding
and
besides
this
i
had
a
great
desire
to
come
upon
the
completed
mill
in
operation
therefore
when
the
day
came
round
i
was
early
on
the
road
having
arranged
for
an
absence
of
several
days
and
to
call
at
theodore
meek
s
for
agnes
who
was
not
going
home
for
the
holidays
until
after
jo
s
marriage
as
i
passed
bragg
s
apartments
i
noticed
that
the
place
was
close
shut
up
and
presumed
he
had
already
left
town
on
the
same
errand
as
that
on
which
i
was
bound
therefore
i
was
not
surprised
when
i
came
up
with
him
a
few
miles
out
driving
his
vicious
horse
to
a
light
buggy
seeing
my
approach
he
allowed
his
horse
to
walk
in
the
road
ahead
of
me
undoubtedly
intended
as
an
insult
but
after
submitting
to
it
a
few
minutes
i
turned
out
and
went
by
him
though
he
lashed
his
horse
and
tried
to
prevent
me
his
horse
was
no
match
for
mine
as
he
very
well
knew
for
the
team
i
drove
trotted
so
briskly
as
to
scandalize
the
church
to
which
my
father
had
belonged
but
bragg
never
admitted
anything
without
a
struggle
as
a
dog
has
to
be
kicked
out
of
your
road
every
day
for
several
miles
i
could
see
him
vigorously
following
whipping
his
mean
horse
but
at
last
i
went
down
into
a
low
valley
where
ran
a
creek
and
lost
sight
of
him
during
all
the
time
i
had
known
him
we
had
never
spoken
except
on
the
night
of
my
arrival
in
twin
mounds
and
as
i
grew
stronger
i
determined
to
whip
him
for
the
many
insolences
he
had
practised
upon
me
i
had
half
a
mind
to
stop
where
i
was
until
he
came
up
and
try
it
there
but
the
uncertainty
of
the
result
and
the
fact
that
my
appearance
would
be
too
much
ruffled
at
best
by
the
encounter
to
make
myself
presentable
at
a
wedding
induced
me
to
give
it
up
and
wait
for
a
more
favorable
opportunity
when
i
drove
up
to
the
meek
s
agnes
was
already
waiting
for
me
and
coming
out
directly
we
were
soon
on
the
way
although
she
was
always
neatly
dressed
and
had
a
very
decided
talent
in
that
direction
her
apparel
was
so
gorgeous
that
day
as
to
cause
me
new
surprise
but
when
i
looked
at
it
attentively
i
was
certain
it
was
inexpensive
and
that
it
was
all
the
work
of
her
own
hands
i
remember
she
was
particularly
gay
and
had
i
not
known
differently
i
might
of
thought
of
her
as
some
favorite
child
of
good
fortune
whose
paths
were
always
pleasant
there
was
nothing
to
mar
her
happiness
it
seemed
except
the
misfortune
of
others
which
she
frequently
mentioned
and
her
sympathy
for
my
mother
was
so
earnest
and
gentle
that
i
worshipped
her
more
than
ever
though
i
had
never
admitted
to
myself
before
that
i
did
not
already
love
her
to
the
greatest
extent
possible
when
we
arrived
at
the
shepherds
jo
met
us
at
the
gate
and
after
showing
agnes
into
the
house
went
with
me
out
to
the
stables
for
some
reason
i
became
convinced
at
once
that
it
would
be
a
dreary
day
for
jo
was
not
so
glad
to
see
me
as
i
had
expected
after
the
long
separation
and
he
seemed
dissatisfied
about
something
although
i
do
not
believe
he
really
was
it
was
a
pleasant
day
though
in
december
and
after
the
horses
were
put
away
we
walked
about
attempting
to
renew
our
old
confidences
and
friendship
but
we
did
not
get
on
as
we
used
to
do
he
was
the
same
jo
in
most
respects
but
he
had
grown
thoughtful
and
careworn
in
the
last
few
years
and
i
mentioned
it
to
which
he
replied
with
some
impatience
you
say
that
whenever
we
meet
you
forget
that
we
are
both
older
and
that
it
has
been
almost
four
years
since
we
were
constantly
together
it
was
always
our
ambition
when
we
were
boys
to
become
men
we
are
becoming
men
very
rapidly
and
while
i
am
satisfied
you
seem
to
complain
of
it
but
we
never
become
so
old
that
we
do
not
have
care
and
responsibility
and
i
look
like
a
thoughtful
man
to
you
only
because
in
the
course
of
years
i
have
grown
to
be
a
thoughtful
man
further
than
my
work
there
is
nothing
to
make
me
thoughtful
but
the
age
i
have
accumulated
naturally
and
i
look
older
because
i
am
older
let
me
assure
you
once
for
all
my
good
old
friend
that
i
am
stout
as
a
lion
i
am
prosperous
i
am
to
be
married
in
a
few
hours
to
the
woman
of
my
choice
and
that
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
not
live
to
a
ripe
old
age
in
the
greatest
peace
there
are
you
satisfied
i
enjoyed
your
friendship
so
much
when
you
were
a
boy
i
answered
that
perhaps
it
is
only
a
fear
that
it
will
be
less
candid
when
we
are
men
i
have
had
no
other
confidant
than
you
and
i
dread
to
see
you
grow
old
for
fear
that
a
man
s
cares
will
cause
you
to
forget
our
boyish
no
fear
of
that
he
said
after
he
had
studied
awhile
as
if
turning
it
all
over
in
his
mind
no
fear
of
that
i
shall
never
grow
too
old
to
confide
my
sorrows
if
i
have
them
and
successes
to
you
however
poorly
a
man
is
raised
he
always
has
a
pleasant
recollection
of
his
youth
it
may
be
only
the
hut
in
which
he
was
born
but
there
is
always
something
and
you
are
the
one
pleasant
recollection
of
my
boyhood
if
i
had
a
great
trouble
i
should
come
to
you
with
it
not
for
help
perhaps
but
for
your
honest
sympathy
and
for
the
satisfaction
of
talking
it
over
freely
so
long
as
i
confess
nothing
to
you
you
may
rest
assured
that
i
am
very
happy
i
don
t
feel
right
just
now
some
way
and
i
can
see
that
you
don
t
but
i
hope
we
shall
get
on
better
later
in
the
day
i
am
very
sorry
but
for
some
reason
the
occasion
does
not
promise
to
be
what
i
expected
probably
one
reason
is
that
i
have
done
a
very
mean
thing
and
when
you
discover
it
as
you
are
sure
to
do
remember
that
i
have
confessed
my
humiliation
and
say
nothing
about
i
had
no
idea
what
it
was
but
as
he
said
i
should
discover
it
i
did
not
press
him
further
it
is
very
curious
jo
said
in
a
confidential
and
perplexed
way
but
the
nearer
my
marriage
approaches
the
less
important
it
seems
i
wonder
that
i
am
so
cool
over
it
you
remember
what
i
said
to
you
once
about
it
that
i
would
sell
myself
to
the
devil
to
be
married
to
mateel
then
not
to
wait
a
minute
i
felt
what
i
said
but
the
years
of
waiting
have
made
a
great
change
in
me
not
that
i
am
less
fond
of
her
but
i
do
not
feel
now
about
it
as
i
did
the
night
we
rode
to
barker
s
the
first
year
of
my
apprenticeship
it
was
never
intended
perhaps
for
anyone
to
be
as
happy
as
i
should
have
been
had
my
marriage
to
mateel
that
night
been
possible
somehow
we
always
have
to
wait
until
the
pleasure
of
an
event
is
blunted
by
familiarity
imperceptibly
as
she
became
a
possibility
i
made
the
discovery
that
she
is
not
an
angel
she
would
be
an
angel
i
have
no
doubt
were
such
a
thing
possible
for
angels
do
not
live
in
the
woods
and
they
do
not
marry
he
tried
very
hard
to
be
cheerful
but
he
could
not
and
when
he
spoke
i
thought
it
was
an
apology
for
his
troubled
face
i
am
very
tired
of
late
for
i
have
worked
almost
night
and
day
for
four
years
and
i
hope
you
will
excuse
me
if
i
do
not
seem
glad
to
see
you
for
i
am
though
just
at
present
for
some
unaccountable
reason
i
am
unable
to
show
it
i
am
sure
i
shall
perceptibly
revive
by
reason
of
your
being
here
but
the
mill
undertaking
was
a
big
one
though
i
shall
speedily
recover
now
that
i
have
more
ease
i
can
t
just
explain
myself
how
it
is
but
i
hope
you
will
believe
i
am
still
jo
erring
and
still
regard
you
as
my
best
i
made
some
sort
of
an
answer
and
we
went
into
the
house
soon
after
both
of
us
more
than
ever
convinced
that
something
was
wrong
though
we
could
not
tell
what
it
was
jo
immediately
disappeared
into
another
room
leaving
me
alone
until
shepherd
came
in
who
although
he
seemed
glad
to
see
me
was
in
such
great
excitement
that
he
had
not
time
to
express
it
you
will
excuse
me
if
i
am
not
myself
he
said
as
he
walked
about
putting
his
hands
to
his
head
as
though
it
pained
him
a
habit
i
had
noticed
before
while
i
approve
of
this
marriage
our
only
child
leaves
us
and
we
can
not
feel
very
gay
about
it
she
has
hardly
been
out
of
our
sight
since
she
was
born
and
so
far
from
feeling
gay
we
are
uncomfortable
although
we
have
no
objection
to
her
husband
it
distresses
her
poor
mother
more
than
it
does
me
i
fear
it
will
be
like
a
funeral
i
hope
jo
will
not
mind
if
she
breaks
down
entirely
i
had
been
hoping
we
should
be
very
happy
but
i
have
lost
all
hope
of
as
shepherd
walked
rapidly
round
the
room
with
his
head
down
he
almost
ran
into
a
door
as
it
opened
to
admit
his
respectable
wife
followed
by
agnes
shepherd
bowed
to
me
stiffly
and
walking
across
the
room
seated
herself
i
had
a
vague
sort
of
notion
that
shepherd
hearing
of
my
arrival
had
come
in
to
pay
her
respects
and
such
a
long
and
awkward
silence
followed
that
i
began
to
upbraid
myself
that
as
a
young
man
of
the
world
i
should
say
something
suitable
while
debating
between
a
joke
and
an
observation
on
the
weather
however
the
door
opened
again
and
jo
and
mateel
stood
before
me
jo
wore
the
suit
in
which
he
had
met
me
at
the
gate
with
the
addition
of
gloves
and
mateel
was
arrayed
as
became
a
bride
both
looked
brave
and
handsome
and
while
admiring
them
and
wondering
what
i
had
better
do
i
was
impressed
with
my
importance
there
someway
but
was
not
certain
how
shepherd
got
up
from
his
chair
and
standing
before
them
pronounced
the
simple
marriage
ceremony
common
in
that
day
in
a
low
and
faltering
voice
then
we
all
knelt
and
the
good
man
earnestly
and
tenderly
invoked
the
blessing
of
god
on
the
union
by
the
time
shepherd
had
risen
to
his
feet
again
his
wife
was
beside
him
and
throwing
her
arms
about
mateel
kissed
her
over
and
over
again
and
asked
her
not
to
cry
as
she
had
shown
evidences
of
doing
somehow
i
thought
they
had
agreed
as
though
it
were
brave
not
to
humiliate
my
worthy
friend
by
creating
a
scene
and
i
wondered
that
they
consented
to
the
marriage
at
all
if
they
did
not
approve
of
it
i
had
never
been
entirely
cured
of
a
dislike
for
shepherd
and
it
came
upon
me
with
renewed
force
that
day
for
i
thought
she
had
every
reason
to
feel
gratified
at
the
marriage
instead
of
sorrowful
for
jo
was
much
the
better
one
of
the
two
any
unprejudiced
person
would
have
said
so
she
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
to
jo
and
i
was
glad
when
shepherd
came
up
and
shook
him
by
the
hand
with
appropriate
words
of
congratulation
after
which
agnes
touched
me
on
the
arm
and
we
went
up
with
our
greetings
when
i
took
mateel
by
the
hand
jo
said
for
me
to
kiss
her
which
i
did
very
awkwardly
i
am
afraid
then
agnes
kissed
jo
and
we
were
all
very
happy
together
some
one
brought
up
chairs
and
jo
and
mateel
sat
down
and
when
i
looked
around
shepherd
and
his
wife
were
gone
after
jo
and
his
bride
had
taken
a
long
breath
and
were
themselves
again
we
four
spent
a
very
uncomfortable
half
hour
together
for
each
one
seemed
to
feel
that
the
others
were
not
at
ease
i
had
thought
jo
s
wedding
would
be
a
merry
event
but
it
was
not
though
i
never
knew
exactly
why
i
noticed
while
we
sat
there
that
mateel
did
not
regain
her
accustomed
color
but
remained
very
pale
from
which
i
imagined
her
health
was
failing
for
she
had
always
been
delicate
the
costly
finery
which
she
wore
though
in
good
taste
made
her
look
ghastly
and
i
was
compelled
to
admit
that
she
had
never
appeared
to
a
worse
advantage
her
cheeks
were
sunken
and
her
form
wasted
and
she
seemed
entirely
too
old
for
the
fresh
young
man
by
her
side
i
imagined
that
jo
thought
of
this
too
and
regretted
she
was
not
more
girlish
when
dinner
was
ready
i
noticed
that
plates
were
laid
for
several
guests
besides
agnes
and
myself
as
if
they
expected
that
more
of
jo
s
friends
would
be
present
whereupon
it
occurred
to
me
to
apologize
that
my
mother
was
ill
and
had
sent
her
regrets
the
regrets
are
accepted
jo
said
as
though
others
had
been
sent
we
could
not
have
a
more
cheerful
company
than
this
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
the
company
is
mateel
expressed
some
such
sentiment
and
so
did
we
all
but
i
wonder
clinton
bragg
is
not
here
i
said
i
met
him
on
the
road
and
i
am
certain
he
was
dressed
for
a
i
immediately
regretted
saying
it
for
i
thought
that
both
mateel
and
jo
colored
at
the
mention
of
his
name
but
after
some
hesitation
mateel
said
he
was
not
at
this
moment
shepherd
excused
himself
to
answer
a
knock
at
the
door
and
when
he
came
back
he
said
that
it
was
clinton
bragg
who
had
stopped
in
on
a
trifling
errand
and
who
had
gone
away
again
i
was
not
surprised
that
the
fellow
appeared
at
the
house
on
that
day
for
he
was
always
where
he
was
not
wanted
but
i
wondered
he
had
not
accepted
the
invitation
to
dinner
which
shepherd
said
he
had
given
it
would
have
been
a
splendid
opportunity
to
make
himself
disagreeable
all
of
them
seemed
to
be
in
a
worse
humor
after
this
and
they
had
not
been
merry
before
mateel
got
up
from
the
table
soon
after
and
insisted
on
helping
her
mother
which
example
was
followed
by
agnes
and
finally
by
shepherd
who
went
to
do
some
sort
of
carving
leaving
jo
and
me
alone
the
dinner
was
an
elaborate
one
and
the
table
set
for
at
least
twenty
so
that
we
felt
lost
in
the
desert
of
dishes
some
of
them
tried
to
be
gay
at
the
circumstance
of
our
being
alone
at
the
table
and
they
helped
us
very
liberally
but
it
was
a
failure
and
the
time
passed
very
dismally
i
believe
that
jo
felt
guilty
that
more
of
his
friends
were
not
present
or
rather
that
he
had
but
two
to
invite
and
i
knew
that
i
felt
very
awkward
in
being
the
groom
s
only
satellite
since
he
had
lived
in
the
neighborhood
all
his
life
and
though
i
attempted
pleasantries
in
great
number
either
they
were
not
heard
or
not
appreciated
so
that
the
dinner
was
very
much
of
a
failure
as
jo
whispered
to
me
as
we
sat
at
one
end
of
the
long
table
together
when
i
went
into
the
other
room
dinner
being
over
at
last
i
found
a
letter
lying
on
the
table
addressed
in
a
neat
hand
to
and
goode
shepherd
and
knowing
it
was
public
i
opened
and
read
a
note
of
regret
from
my
grandmother
as
she
could
not
write
i
knew
what
jo
meant
when
he
said
i
would
that
day
detect
him
in
a
mean
action
he
had
written
it
himself
in
order
to
avoid
the
and
because
i
was
uncomfortable
at
the
shepherds
house
i
drove
over
to
the
mill
with
agnes
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
where
we
spent
several
hours
in
putting
the
house
in
order
for
the
coming
of
jo
and
mateel
i
had
not
been
in
the
house
since
it
was
remodelled
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
its
arrangement
the
old
house
had
but
two
rooms
but
jo
had
added
two
others
and
furnished
them
neatly
and
comfortably
and
in
good
taste
the
room
in
front
was
transformed
into
a
pretty
parlor
and
opening
off
this
was
a
sleeping
apartment
the
old
kitchen
remained
but
i
would
not
have
known
it
so
great
was
the
change
and
adjoining
it
and
connecting
with
the
parlor
was
a
which
completed
the
number
agnes
admired
the
house
as
much
as
i
did
and
complimented
jo
so
much
that
i
regretted
i
had
not
expended
my
energies
on
one
like
it
i
think
i
resolved
to
look
about
when
i
returned
to
town
for
an
old
house
and
fit
it
up
by
degrees
but
i
have
no
doubt
i
forgot
it
entirely
within
an
hour
the
mill
had
been
completed
a
month
before
and
had
been
in
successful
operation
since
i
can
only
remember
now
that
it
was
a
very
good
one
for
that
day
and
that
it
was
an
improvement
on
the
one
belonging
to
damon
barker
for
its
machinery
was
of
late
and
improved
make
jo
had
never
told
me
but
i
believed
he
was
greatly
in
debt
for
in
addition
to
the
amount
due
on
the
machinery
he
had
rebuilt
and
furnished
the
house
where
he
was
to
live
therefore
i
was
not
surprised
to
find
the
mill
in
full
operation
in
charge
of
his
assistant
as
that
was
a
busy
season
agnes
and
i
went
through
it
after
we
had
finished
at
the
house
from
the
great
wheels
in
the
cellar
to
the
small
ones
in
the
roof
and
complimented
jo
so
much
that
his
ears
certainly
tingled
jo
and
mateel
did
not
arrive
until
after
dark
and
we
had
the
lights
and
fires
burning
when
they
came
in
after
laying
off
her
wraps
mateel
looked
around
the
pleasant
room
but
did
not
say
anything
seeming
sick
and
distressed
and
when
she
went
with
us
through
the
rooms
agnes
carrying
the
light
she
only
said
yes
when
some
one
remarked
that
this
or
that
was
pretty
or
no
when
it
was
said
that
something
else
could
not
be
nicer
i
thought
that
jo
was
very
much
hurt
at
this
for
she
seemed
to
take
everything
as
a
matter
of
course
and
the
only
words
she
spoke
were
as
to
what
should
have
been
done
rather
than
as
referring
to
what
had
been
done
already
which
was
a
great
deal
for
the
house
was
better
furnished
and
more
complete
in
every
way
than
the
one
in
which
she
had
lived
i
thought
at
first
that
she
was
thinking
the
arrangements
for
her
comfort
were
no
more
than
she
deserved
if
as
much
but
i
concluded
later
in
the
evening
that
she
was
not
herself
and
that
the
parting
with
her
mother
had
been
a
great
trial
although
i
could
not
understand
why
for
they
were
separated
only
by
a
few
miles
and
could
see
each
other
every
day
we
had
been
sitting
about
the
fire
for
an
hour
or
more
where
we
seemed
to
get
along
better
than
at
any
other
time
during
the
day
when
a
rap
came
at
the
door
and
on
its
being
opened
by
jo
damon
barker
walked
in
we
were
all
very
much
delighted
and
surprised
to
see
him
and
after
saluting
jo
and
his
wife
with
a
polite
word
of
congratulation
he
took
the
chair
agnes
brought
up
and
sat
down
in
the
circle
i
could
not
come
over
very
well
he
said
speaking
to
mateel
so
i
came
i
thought
i
knew
who
would
be
here
beside
yourselves
looking
at
agnes
and
then
at
me
and
i
find
the
company
i
had
expected
i
wish
you
all
a
merry
we
had
not
thought
of
it
before
having
been
occupied
with
the
events
of
the
day
but
barker
suggested
it
by
taking
a
number
of
packages
from
his
pockets
which
he
leaned
against
the
legs
of
his
chair
after
we
had
returned
his
compliment
he
said
i
am
not
fond
of
ceremonies
of
any
kind
but
i
am
fond
of
a
fire
like
this
on
christmas
eve
and
a
company
like
this
so
i
came
unannounced
i
hope
you
are
glad
to
see
we
all
announced
in
a
chorus
that
we
were
it
is
very
polite
in
you
to
say
so
barker
replied
i
lead
a
lonely
life
over
there
pointing
in
the
direction
of
his
mill
with
the
hand
in
which
he
held
another
package
from
his
pocket
looking
very
much
like
a
long
bottle
wrapped
in
brown
paper
though
probably
no
lonelier
than
i
desire
jo
and
i
became
very
good
friends
when
we
were
in
solitude
together
and
i
think
i
could
not
have
rested
had
i
not
walked
over
to
congratulate
him
and
his
pretty
he
settled
down
in
his
chair
and
looked
around
the
room
as
if
admiring
it
it
has
been
a
long
time
since
i
felt
so
much
at
home
as
i
do
at
this
having
put
down
the
package
which
looked
like
a
bottle
he
picked
up
another
one
and
commenced
unwrapping
it
but
soon
stopped
and
continued
talking
leaving
us
to
wonder
what
it
contained
i
hope
my
presence
will
not
interfere
with
your
enjoyment
let
me
sit
here
in
the
corner
and
look
at
you
without
being
in
the
he
began
unwrapping
the
package
again
but
forgot
it
as
he
became
more
interested
i
enjoy
looking
at
fresh
young
faces
and
it
is
not
often
i
have
the
opportunity
i
beg
that
you
go
on
with
the
conversation
i
warrant
it
was
a
merry
one
in
progress
when
i
disturbed
you
by
rapping
don
t
mind
me
at
all
but
if
you
should
address
me
occasionally
and
intimate
that
i
had
added
something
to
the
occasion
i
should
enjoy
myself
very
much
by
this
tune
the
package
was
unwrapped
and
it
turned
out
to
be
a
handsome
jewel
case
with
a
set
of
expensive
jewelry
on
the
inside
this
he
handed
to
mateel
with
a
bow
and
picking
up
another
package
went
on
with
his
talking
and
unwrapping
for
twelve
years
i
have
been
almost
a
hermit
here
in
the
woods
and
during
all
that
time
i
have
not
met
so
pleasant
a
company
as
this
i
never
felt
more
welcome
in
my
life
whether
i
am
or
not
and
i
have
an
idea
that
i
feel
very
much
as
the
rest
of
you
do
comfortable
and
by
this
time
the
other
package
came
out
and
it
was
so
much
like
the
first
one
that
we
could
not
tell
them
apart
this
he
gave
to
agnes
who
was
greatly
surprised
and
she
hesitated
in
taking
it
but
he
did
not
notice
her
and
diving
down
beside
his
chair
handed
the
package
to
me
and
its
mate
to
jo
retaining
another
one
of
the
same
pattern
for
himself
these
three
contain
liquor
so
old
that
i
feel
quite
young
in
their
company
he
said
without
noticing
the
surprise
which
his
presents
to
mateel
and
agnes
had
created
for
they
were
very
valuable
and
combined
and
stirred
with
a
little
hot
water
a
little
sugar
a
few
slices
of
lemon
and
nutmeg
they
make
a
punch
very
fit
and
appropriate
for
a
party
of
five
if
you
have
a
bowl
handy
i
will
stir
them
as
he
said
this
he
got
up
from
his
chair
and
began
preparations
for
the
punch
by
taking
from
the
pockets
of
the
coat
he
had
laid
off
a
bag
of
lemons
and
a
corkscrew
jo
and
i
went
out
and
lighted
the
fire
for
the
hot
water
and
while
we
were
waiting
for
it
we
heard
barker
asking
as
a
favor
that
nothing
more
be
said
about
the
presents
conscious
that
the
wedding
was
ending
better
than
it
had
commenced
jo
and
i
shook
hands
over
the
circumstance
and
we
soon
had
the
kitchen
fire
roaring
and
the
water
hot
and
taking
it
into
the
front
room
barker
had
the
bottles
opened
and
the
lemons
sliced
and
the
sugar
and
nutmeg
being
brought
the
punch
was
soon
ready
which
i
think
was
composed
of
champagne
and
a
mixed
liquor
made
for
that
purpose
it
was
certainly
very
good
and
jo
and
i
drank
of
it
very
liberally
i
had
never
seen
barker
in
good
spirits
before
and
it
was
not
long
before
all
of
us
caught
the
infection
we
not
only
drank
of
the
punch
but
we
went
into
the
kitchen
and
brought
out
something
to
eat
and
after
this
the
good
humor
of
every
one
increased
so
much
that
it
was
agreed
that
if
barker
would
give
a
selection
from
a
play
with
which
he
was
familiar
and
which
he
did
remarkably
well
jo
and
i
would
sing
songs
to
be
followed
by
a
duet
by
mateel
and
agnes
while
these
arrangements
were
in
progress
i
went
to
the
door
to
see
how
the
weather
was
as
i
had
a
long
drive
before
me
and
as
i
stood
there
i
saw
a
horseman
pass
in
the
road
who
i
was
certain
was
clinton
bragg
those
on
the
inside
were
merrily
laughing
and
i
purposely
opened
the
door
that
he
might
hear
it
and
know
that
mateel
and
jo
were
happy
and
surrounded
by
friends
i
thought
that
he
might
come
in
with
some
kind
of
a
message
for
mateel
but
i
resolved
that
if
he
attempted
it
i
would
knock
him
down
and
beat
him
at
the
gate
for
i
felt
the
punch
and
was
in
a
humor
for
that
kind
of
business
but
he
rode
slowly
past
and
i
am
certain
that
he
heard
the
gay
laughter
and
that
no
one
knew
of
his
presence
except
myself
although
barker
drank
as
freely
as
jo
and
i
he
was
evidently
more
accustomed
to
it
and
did
not
mind
it
though
it
had
no
other
effect
on
us
than
to
increase
our
good
spirits
agnes
and
mateel
partook
but
sparingly
but
they
were
both
in
better
humor
than
i
had
ever
seen
them
and
applauded
whatever
we
did
barker
gave
his
selection
from
the
play
it
was
a
tragedy
and
he
limped
in
from
the
kitchen
saying
something
about
that
being
the
winter
of
our
discontent
after
which
jo
and
i
started
a
imitating
the
singing
preaching
and
shouting
of
the
fairview
people
which
performance
was
received
with
rounds
of
applause
mateel
and
agnes
then
sang
their
duet
in
appreciation
of
which
we
clapped
our
hands
until
they
sang
another
one
and
thus
the
time
passed
until
after
midnight
during
the
evening
jo
found
opportunity
to
express
his
pleasure
that
everything
had
turned
out
so
well
and
whenever
we
were
alone
i
think
both
of
us
had
a
good
deal
to
say
about
an
old
boy
and
the
best
friend
in
the
world
for
we
lost
all
of
the
restraint
which
made
us
so
uncomfortable
in
the
morning
and
fully
renewed
our
old
friendship
when
we
broke
up
and
had
said
our
adieus
over
and
over
i
found
my
team
at
the
door
through
the
kindness
of
the
assistant
at
the
mill
and
after
we
had
closed
the
door
for
positively
the
last
time
we
opened
it
again
for
another
kind
word
and
were
very
merry
and
gay
there
was
a
light
fall
of
snow
on
the
ground
and
the
night
and
the
roads
being
fine
i
insisted
on
taking
barker
in
the
buggy
and
driving
him
home
knowing
the
horses
would
enjoy
the
dash
along
the
level
roads
in
the
woods
he
at
first
objected
but
agnes
adding
her
entreaty
he
finally
consented
and
after
calling
to
jo
until
he
opened
the
door
again
we
waved
our
hands
once
more
crossed
the
creek
below
the
mill
and
dashed
away
i
was
proud
of
the
speed
of
the
team
and
barker
was
at
first
very
nervous
at
the
pace
at
which
i
drove
but
finding
i
was
a
careful
driver
he
leaned
contentedly
back
and
repeatedly
said
the
drive
was
a
pleasant
ending
to
the
agreeable
evening
at
jo
s
house
when
we
arrived
at
the
mill
he
invited
us
in
and
as
agnes
had
never
been
at
his
house
and
had
often
expressed
a
curiosity
to
see
it
we
accepted
the
invitation
though
it
was
two
or
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
as
i
expected
there
was
still
fire
in
the
great
box
stove
in
his
room
for
it
seemed
never
to
go
out
and
with
a
little
stirring
and
fuel
it
was
soon
roaring
we
walked
through
all
the
rooms
barker
carrying
the
light
and
appearing
to
be
pleased
and
contented
i
told
agnes
of
the
delightful
stories
barker
had
related
to
jo
and
me
in
the
big
room
with
the
heavy
shutters
and
even
insisted
that
he
tell
another
one
to
give
agnes
an
idea
of
his
talent
in
that
direction
but
he
laughingly
replied
that
it
was
late
and
that
they
would
prove
very
dull
now
that
we
were
older
i
have
another
story
to
tell
you
though
he
said
after
some
reflection
but
it
is
not
quite
ready
and
as
it
is
a
story
for
men
it
is
fortunate
that
you
are
almost
a
man
in
good
time
i
will
tell
it
to
you
and
if
you
choose
you
may
repeat
it
to
while
we
were
warming
ourselves
at
the
fire
for
completing
the
ride
i
questioned
him
about
it
but
it
seemed
to
be
of
no
importance
for
he
laughed
gayly
and
would
only
say
that
when
he
was
ready
he
would
remind
me
of
it
after
spending
an
hour
there
we
started
for
theodore
meek
s
and
although
i
repeatedly
informed
agnes
that
she
was
the
best
and
prettiest
girl
in
the
world
and
that
i
was
very
much
in
love
with
her
she
was
not
at
all
serious
seeming
to
regard
it
as
a
part
of
the
gayety
of
the
night
and
after
reaching
the
house
and
having
a
laugh
all
around
with
the
family
who
got
up
to
hear
about
the
wedding
we
went
to
bed
just
as
day
began
to
appear
in
the
east
chapter
xxi
the
peculiarities
of
a
country
town
there
was
one
thing
i
noticed
of
twin
mounds
which
is
probably
true
of
every
other
country
town
it
was
constantly
threatened
either
with
great
prosperity
or
great
danger
but
whether
the
event
threatening
the
prosperity
or
the
danger
came
to
pass
the
town
progressed
about
the
same
there
was
no
perceptible
effect
from
any
of
the
events
the
people
were
certain
would
prove
either
very
disastrous
or
of
great
benefit
from
which
i
am
led
to
believe
that
no
one
is
familiar
with
the
art
of
although
i
have
never
known
a
man
who
did
not
profess
to
know
all
there
is
worth
knowing
about
the
science
towns
seem
to
be
the
natural
accretion
of
years
and
although
the
people
in
twin
mounds
often
related
how
desperate
were
their
struggles
with
adversity
the
facts
probably
are
that
the
place
would
have
been
fully
as
large
as
it
was
three
years
after
jo
s
marriage
without
the
great
number
of
public
meetings
for
public
purposes
and
the
endless
worry
of
individuals
with
reference
to
it
there
was
a
very
general
impression
that
manufactories
were
needed
and
this
was
talked
about
so
much
and
so
many
inducements
were
offered
that
the
people
became
discouraged
believing
that
the
average
manufacturer
had
a
wicked
heart
and
a
hollow
head
to
thus
wrong
twin
mounds
in
the
face
of
his
own
interest
therefore
we
were
very
much
surprised
to
learn
once
after
all
hope
had
been
abandoned
that
a
quiet
man
was
building
a
woollen
mill
down
the
river
which
he
completed
and
afterwards
operated
without
the
help
of
the
committees
which
had
been
appointed
to
aid
in
such
matters
of
public
weal
the
trouble
was
that
the
man
lived
in
twin
mounds
whereas
we
had
been
expecting
a
man
and
money
to
come
from
a
distant
point
for
that
purpose
and
had
never
thought
of
looking
about
home
but
spent
a
great
deal
of
money
in
sending
committees
away
to
make
arrangements
for
a
woollen
mill
this
circumstance
although
humiliating
proved
a
good
thing
for
it
taught
the
people
that
if
the
town
were
to
be
built
up
at
all
it
must
be
by
its
own
citizens
which
knowledge
was
afterwards
used
to
good
advantage
the
people
were
always
miserable
by
reason
of
predictions
that
unless
impossible
amounts
of
money
were
given
to
certain
enterprises
the
town
would
be
ruined
and
although
they
always
gave
no
sooner
was
one
fund
exhausted
than
it
became
necessary
to
raise
another
it
was
said
during
the
collection
of
each
amount
that
it
would
never
be
necessary
again
to
give
to
this
sort
of
charity
as
the
enterprise
then
in
hand
would
insure
the
future
of
twin
mounds
but
there
was
never
an
end
to
the
ridiculous
business
and
we
were
always
in
a
state
of
dreariness
on
this
account
as
the
men
demanding
the
charity
for
insignificant
enterprises
loudly
threatened
to
go
to
the
rival
towns
and
permit
the
grass
to
grow
in
our
streets
in
thinking
of
the
matter
since
i
have
thought
that
twin
mounds
would
have
been
a
much
better
town
but
for
the
fact
that
it
was
always
expecting
improbable
disaster
but
which
never
came
for
the
people
were
thus
prevented
from
exercising
their
energy
if
they
had
any
i
never
formed
a
good
opinion
of
a
man
there
that
i
was
not
finally
told
something
to
his
discredit
by
another
citizen
causing
me
to
regard
him
with
great
suspicion
and
if
i
said
a
good
word
for
any
of
them
it
was
proved
beyond
question
immediately
that
he
was
a
very
unscrupulous
a
very
ridiculous
a
very
weak
and
a
very
worthless
man
there
were
no
friendships
among
them
and
they
all
hated
each
other
in
secret
there
being
much
quiet
satisfaction
when
one
of
them
failed
there
seemed
to
be
no
regular
aristocracy
either
for
i
heard
so
frequently
how
ignorant
and
awkward
the
prominent
citizens
were
when
they
first
came
that
i
finally
found
them
all
out
if
medicine
told
me
what
an
unpromising
lout
the
present
magnificent
honorable
legal
was
when
he
first
arrived
and
how
much
difficulty
he
had
in
getting
him
introduced
into
respectable
society
i
was
certain
to
meet
honorable
legal
soon
after
and
hear
him
recite
a
similar
experience
with
reference
to
medicine
one
of
the
stories
and
i
found
afterwards
that
it
was
true
was
that
a
man
of
ordinary
worth
who
seemed
to
be
prosperous
had
collected
his
money
of
a
railroad
company
in
the
country
he
had
moved
from
because
of
an
injury
to
his
first
wife
and
that
his
second
was
enabled
to
go
elegantly
dressed
because
of
the
misfortune
of
the
first
thus
it
went
on
until
i
was
familiar
with
the
poor
origin
of
all
of
them
and
perhaps
this
was
one
reason
why
we
did
not
respect
one
another
more
it
was
a
popular
expression
that
every
one
favorably
mentioned
was
the
worst
overrated
man
in
america
and
the
only
real
ability
any
of
them
ever
displayed
was
in
looking
up
the
previous
history
of
each
other
which
they
carried
on
with
great
vigor
and
frequently
with
alarming
results
i
began
to
believe
in
course
of
time
that
it
was
fortunate
that
the
discreditable
part
of
my
history
was
well
known
for
it
was
the
sooner
forgotten
because
it
was
not
necessary
to
look
up
old
records
to
find
it
out
and
thus
was
not
made
worse
than
it
really
was
very
few
of
the
twin
mounds
men
had
positive
opinions
of
their
own
as
they
seemed
to
have
got
them
from
some
source
and
none
of
them
was
original
or
natural
in
his
methods
of
conducting
business
or
in
his
habits
two
or
three
times
a
year
most
of
them
visited
a
city
a
good
many
miles
away
where
they
spent
a
great
deal
of
money
they
could
not
afford
to
create
an
impression
that
they
were
accustomed
to
what
they
supposed
was
good
society
and
where
they
met
men
who
filled
their
ideas
of
greatness
these
they
mimicked
each
one
choosing
a
different
example
so
it
happened
that
the
men
of
twin
mounds
were
very
ridiculous
there
was
a
lawyer
i
remember
who
had
met
somewhere
a
distinguished
member
of
his
profession
who
shook
hands
ho
ho
with
everybody
and
ha
ha
patronizingly
wanted
to
know
how
they
were
getting
along
it
was
not
his
natural
way
and
as
he
only
adopted
it
because
he
believed
it
would
make
him
popular
it
became
him
very
poorly
perhaps
it
was
very
effective
with
the
man
the
habit
had
been
copied
from
but
it
was
very
absurd
with
our
citizen
whose
pretence
was
that
every
man
he
shook
hands
with
and
he
shook
hands
cordially
with
everybody
was
not
getting
along
as
well
as
he
in
his
great
compassion
desired
another
one
who
carried
on
a
business
which
one
busy
day
would
have
exhausted
had
heard
of
a
man
who
achieved
commercial
greatness
by
finding
fault
i
am
sure
the
man
was
mistaken
for
no
one
ever
made
money
in
such
a
ridiculous
way
and
i
never
heard
of
anything
that
suited
him
this
he
regarded
as
business
shrewdness
and
he
finally
became
very
sour
in
disposition
because
he
was
generally
regarded
as
a
fool
instead
of
a
prophet
still
another
naturally
full
of
fool
s
gab
carried
on
a
bank
in
awful
silence
because
he
had
heard
that
still
water
runs
deep
though
i
have
seen
ponds
of
perfectly
still
water
which
were
very
shallow
as
i
grew
older
and
began
to
notice
more
i
thought
that
every
man
in
twin
mounds
had
reason
to
feel
humiliated
that
he
had
not
accomplished
more
but
most
of
them
were
as
conceited
as
though
there
was
nothing
left
in
the
world
worthy
of
their
attention
their
small
business
affairs
their
quarrels
over
the
bible
and
an
occasional
term
in
the
town
council
or
a
mention
for
the
legislature
or
a
county
office
satisfied
them
and
they
were
as
content
as
men
who
really
amounted
to
something
although
i
believe
there
never
was
a
more
virtuous
community
the
men
pretended
to
believe
that
their
associates
were
great
libertines
and
many
of
the
women
were
scandalized
in
an
unjust
and
cruel
manner
the
men
rather
took
a
pride
in
reputations
of
this
sort
for
they
never
had
any
other
and
although
pretending
to
deny
it
they
really
hoped
the
people
would
continue
to
accuse
them
i
have
known
citizens
of
this
description
to
stay
out
late
at
night
and
take
aimless
rides
into
the
country
to
create
the
impression
that
they
were
having
clandestine
meetings
with
the
first
ladies
of
the
town
the
people
watched
each
other
so
closely
that
there
was
no
opportunity
to
be
other
than
honest
and
circumspect
in
this
particular
even
if
they
had
been
differently
inclined
and
since
the
men
were
always
looking
for
amours
but
never
found
them
and
believed
that
others
were
notoriously
successful
they
must
have
had
a
very
contemptible
opinion
of
themselves
when
they
thought
about
the
matter
candidly
i
often
heard
from
jo
and
frequently
met
him
and
he
always
seemed
to
be
happy
and
prosperous
the
debt
on
the
mill
was
being
gradually
reduced
through
his
sturdy
efforts
and
in
the
middle
of
the
second
year
of
his
marriage
he
had
built
an
addition
to
his
house
which
made
it
very
complete
his
business
was
prosperous
because
he
gave
it
a
great
deal
of
intelligent
attention
and
he
became
widely
known
as
one
of
the
promising
young
men
of
that
part
of
the
country
for
nobody
worked
so
hard
as
he
did
nor
to
so
much
purpose
and
the
business
principles
he
had
adopted
were
excellent
the
product
of
his
mill
was
called
the
erring
s
ford
brand
we
having
agreed
on
the
name
together
because
it
was
odd
and
because
it
celebrated
a
hope
which
had
been
ridiculed
by
the
fairview
folks
and
we
printed
large
bills
announcing
its
superiority
which
were
distributed
so
well
that
wherever
i
went
i
was
reminded
of
my
skill
as
a
printer
and
jo
s
superiority
as
a
miller
at
long
intervals
he
came
to
our
house
with
his
pretty
wife
and
i
always
thought
they
were
very
happy
as
i
have
no
doubt
they
were
i
do
not
remember
that
i
thought
much
of
them
during
the
three
years
i
am
now
passing
rapidly
over
except
that
jo
had
made
himself
the
equal
of
his
wife
which
was
a
pleasant
reflection
to
me
because
he
had
begun
so
far
behind
her
and
with
the
utmost
friendship
for
mateel
i
was
always
pleased
when
jo
appeared
to
better
advantage
than
she
did
or
when
i
thought
that
if
a
stranger
should
judge
between
them
the
impression
would
be
that
jo
was
the
superior
one
of
the
two
i
had
the
impression
that
jo
was
an
excellent
husband
for
he
was
always
thinking
of
what
would
please
mateel
and
when
they
were
together
he
was
as
gentle
and
gallant
as
he
had
been
when
they
were
lovers
which
i
have
heard
is
very
unusual
mateel
was
a
good
wife
but
i
do
not
know
that
i
ever
heard
her
say
a
kind
word
for
her
husband
although
others
talked
about
him
a
great
deal
she
thought
no
doubt
that
his
excellences
were
understood
and
did
not
need
to
be
mentioned
i
thought
of
this
circumstance
then
because
i
believed
it
would
have
been
no
more
than
natural
for
her
to
say
that
jo
had
succeeded
well
or
that
he
had
bravely
won
her
but
she
never
did
although
she
seemed
pleased
when
i
complimented
her
husband
as
though
it
was
an
expression
of
a
hope
that
if
he
were
not
so
rich
then
as
she
desired
he
might
be
in
the
future
usually
when
jo
and
mateel
came
to
twin
mounds
agnes
came
with
them
as
it
was
their
custom
to
drive
over
on
saturday
and
back
in
the
evening
of
the
next
day
and
with
so
many
of
her
old
friends
around
her
my
mother
perceptibly
revived
but
when
they
had
gone
away
she
resumed
her
old
melancholy
and
pined
away
in
the
room
where
she
watched
at
night
if
they
offered
to
take
her
home
with
them
she
refused
and
never
went
out
except
occasionally
to
ride
with
me
and
then
i
thought
it
was
more
to
admire
the
speed
of
dan
and
dave
than
because
she
cared
to
leave
the
house
although
the
rev
john
westlock
was
never
heard
of
the
light
was
always
burning
in
his
old
room
at
night
and
his
deserted
wife
was
always
waiting
to
forgive
him
i
think
she
never
for
a
moment
gave
up
the
hope
that
he
would
come
back
for
winter
and
summer
alike
she
waited
for
him
every
night
and
was
weaker
the
next
day
because
he
did
not
come
the
fear
began
to
oppress
me
that
some
morning
we
should
find
her
dead
at
her
post
and
i
proposed
to
get
some
one
to
stay
with
her
at
night
but
she
would
not
hear
of
it
thinking
no
doubt
that
when
he
came
he
would
much
prefer
to
find
her
alone
thus
the
months
went
by
and
at
the
close
of
every
one
i
found
that
her
head
was
whiter
and
her
step
more
feeble
i
saw
lytle
biggs
nearly
every
week
and
big
adam
often
came
there
with
products
of
the
farm
to
sell
and
he
always
came
in
to
see
me
usually
having
the
information
to
impart
that
another
relative
had
been
killed
by
the
indians
or
that
his
old
mistress
jawed
him
more
than
ever
if
he
found
it
necessary
to
stay
in
the
town
over
night
which
was
sometimes
the
case
i
took
him
home
with
me
and
treated
him
with
so
much
consideration
in
other
ways
that
he
soon
became
my
greatest
friend
from
him
i
learned
that
agnes
only
came
home
during
the
two
vacations
of
the
year
and
that
her
mother
was
about
the
same
with
respect
to
visions
of
poisoning
and
smothering
which
humiliated
them
all
very
much
except
big
adam
who
said
he
considered
it
an
honor
for
the
people
to
believe
that
he
would
poison
his
mistress
if
he
had
opportunity
for
they
all
knew
she
deserved
it
biggs
and
the
children
had
changed
but
little
except
that
the
children
had
grown
larger
and
more
unruly
and
their
mother
more
shrivelled
than
formerly
big
adam
was
quite
a
novelty
in
twin
mounds
by
reason
of
his
great
size
and
hoarse
voice
and
a
crowd
always
gathered
at
the
office
when
he
was
there
in
the
evening
to
hear
him
tell
about
the
great
farm
he
was
expected
to
cultivate
alone
although
i
was
always
hoping
he
would
kill
himself
with
dissipation
clinton
bragg
continued
to
be
only
about
as
worthless
as
when
i
had
first
known
him
and
there
was
no
change
in
his
manner
except
that
he
made
up
with
every
old
wreck
who
came
to
town
and
induced
him
by
treats
to
listen
to
his
brags
about
himself
bragg
came
from
a
place
somewhere
in
the
east
which
was
given
over
to
the
manufacture
of
knives
and
forks
and
the
three
or
four
proprietors
of
the
works
comprised
the
aristocracy
these
lacking
better
company
associated
occasionally
with
the
small
tradesmen
and
professional
men
of
the
town
which
led
them
to
talk
a
great
deal
of
the
excellent
society
in
which
they
moved
and
judging
them
by
their
representative
in
twin
mounds
they
became
very
unpopular
wherever
they
went
by
reason
of
this
unpleasant
egotism
his
father
a
but
ignorant
man
by
close
attention
to
the
business
of
keeping
a
keg
house
had
risen
to
the
dignity
of
a
merchant
and
was
reputed
to
be
although
as
is
usually
the
case
i
doubt
if
he
had
half
the
money
with
which
he
was
credited
bragg
considered
this
community
as
the
greatest
the
world
had
ever
produced
and
made
himself
very
disagreeable
in
talking
about
it
being
a
great
liar
naturally
and
as
no
one
in
twin
mounds
knew
differently
he
used
a
citizen
of
the
town
where
he
had
lived
to
traduce
citizens
of
twin
mounds
and
if
a
lawyer
lost
a
case
or
won
it
he
told
cheerful
anecdotes
of
his
brilliant
friend
bighead
the
leader
of
his
profession
in
forkston
no
difference
what
happened
in
twin
mounds
it
reminded
him
of
a
friend
of
his
in
the
town
where
knives
were
made
who
always
did
whatever
was
in
hand
in
a
much
more
creditable
manner
when
he
was
drinking
he
went
about
inquiring
who
alexander
bighead
was
who
cornelius
deadhead
was
who
elwyn
flathead
was
who
godfrey
hardhead
was
or
who
isaac
jughead
was
nobody
being
able
to
inform
him
none
of
them
having
ever
been
heard
of
outside
of
the
community
where
they
lived
bragg
would
answer
that
alexander
bighead
was
a
great
lawyer
and
a
great
drunkard
and
that
cornelius
deadhead
was
as
noted
for
his
knowledge
of
medicine
as
he
was
noted
for
his
intemperance
that
elwyn
flathead
was
a
heavy
trader
and
a
heavy
drinker
that
godfrey
hardhead
was
frequently
on
the
public
platform
and
frequently
in
the
gutter
and
that
isaac
jughead
was
as
often
on
a
spree
as
he
was
on
the
bench
which
argument
was
intended
to
convey
the
impression
that
all
talented
men
clinton
bragg
included
drank
more
than
was
good
for
them
lytle
biggs
being
a
professional
politician
was
often
in
town
and
as
has
been
the
case
when
he
first
met
me
he
was
of
the
opinion
that
while
i
was
a
little
delicate
in
asking
him
for
the
favor
i
was
burning
with
impatience
to
hear
more
of
his
philosophy
i
had
enjoyed
it
very
much
at
first
and
laughed
a
great
deal
at
his
oddities
and
though
it
finally
grew
tiresome
i
could
not
very
well
flatly
tell
him
so
hence
he
came
in
frequently
when
i
was
very
busy
and
when
i
knew
he
was
not
in
a
philosophical
humor
but
reasoning
that
i
had
grown
to
expect
it
and
had
little
other
amusement
he
consented
to
favor
me
with
a
few
of
his
thoughts
thus
it
came
about
that
he
walked
in
one
evening
when
i
was
anxious
to
go
home
and
seating
himself
prepared
to
spend
several
hours
with
me
though
i
could
see
he
regarded
himself
as
a
martyr
to
be
compelled
to
instruct
me
in
ordinary
affairs
which
should
be
understood
at
a
glance
speaking
of
the
newspaper
business
he
said
of
which
we
were
not
speaking
at
all
i
make
considerable
money
advising
the
farmers
to
patronize
the
rural
home
than
which
in
my
opinion
a
greater
literary
thug
never
existed
but
unfortunately
for
an
oppressed
people
the
publisher
of
the
home
his
name
is
litch
it
should
be
leech
pays
liberal
commissions
and
i
must
live
i
have
a
copy
in
my
pocket
you
may
examine
it
when
there
is
positively
nothing
else
to
he
handed
it
to
me
and
although
it
was
folded
i
saw
on
the
first
page
a
picture
of
an
animal
so
admirably
proportioned
that
but
little
was
wasted
in
legs
being
solid
meat
with
the
exception
of
a
small
head
and
four
pins
to
hold
it
up
by
examining
the
note
at
the
bottom
i
found
it
was
a
pig
although
i
should
not
have
suspected
it
in
the
absence
of
the
statement
and
that
pairs
of
the
breed
could
be
had
by
addressing
the
publisher
and
enclosing
money
order
or
draft
for
fifty
dollars
if
you
should
do
yourself
the
injustice
at
some
time
in
the
future
to
look
it
over
biggs
continued
indicating
that
i
was
not
to
look
at
it
then
but
to
listen
you
would
find
it
filled
with
all
sorts
of
ingenious
appeals
for
the
farmer
s
money
and
that
the
editor
claims
to
be
poor
but
honest
and
oppressed
by
monopolies
like
the
rest
of
them
but
what
are
the
hard
uncomfortable
facts
i
looked
at
him
as
if
to
say
that
i
did
not
know
what
the
facts
were
but
had
no
doubt
they
were
bad
enough
the
facts
are
that
while
the
agricultural
population
is
cooped
up
in
hot
drinking
spring
water
and
attending
alliance
meetings
the
publisher
of
the
rural
is
holding
ice
in
his
mouth
at
an
elegant
club
only
changing
this
delightful
occupation
to
gulp
down
expensive
champagne
he
lives
in
a
villa
does
this
agricultural
fraud
of
the
name
of
litch
and
makes
a
fortune
every
year
and
although
he
earnestly
advises
the
farmers
wives
and
daughters
to
spend
their
spare
time
in
churning
the
butter
and
gathering
the
eggs
to
buy
good
books
to
improve
themselves
for
which
he
is
agent
he
sends
his
own
wife
and
daughters
to
spend
their
spare
time
in
summer
at
cool
places
where
they
may
swim
in
the
sea
that
s
the
kind
of
an
oppressed
citizen
of
a
groaning
government
litch
is
and
i
happen
to
know
that
he
is
the
friend
of
the
monopolists
he
denounces
and
that
he
is
in
their
pay
that
he
is
the
tool
of
the
thieves
who
manufacture
worthless
machinery
for
farmers
of
the
confidence
men
who
advertise
eggs
pigs
and
calves
at
a
high
price
and
that
he
is
the
worst
enemy
of
the
farmers
i
pretended
to
be
very
much
surprised
at
this
though
i
was
not
if
you
should
be
caught
in
a
lonely
place
on
a
rainy
day
with
no
other
paper
in
your
pocket
than
that
you
would
find
a
column
of
inquiries
with
reference
to
agricultural
matters
addressed
to
the
editor
who
is
supposed
to
be
informed
but
who
really
gets
all
his
information
from
the
agricultural
departments
of
the
metropolitan
papers
each
one
of
which
closes
with
a
good
word
for
your
noble
or
your
brave
or
your
widely
circulated
paper
the
scoundrel
writes
them
himself
and
there
is
another
column
from
aunt
he
is
also
aunt
in
short
he
is
everything
except
an
honest
although
i
said
nothing
i
remembered
that
every
farmer
who
moved
to
twin
mounds
found
out
the
agricultural
papers
and
denounced
them
in
short
that
everybody
except
the
farmers
knew
what
dreadful
frauds
they
were
if
i
should
talk
as
candidly
and
honestly
to
my
friends
of
the
plough
as
i
talk
to
my
friends
of
the
pen
biggs
continued
i
should
advise
them
to
take
the
papers
which
other
people
take
the
papers
which
censure
the
farmer
when
he
deserves
it
instead
of
pandering
to
his
ignorance
and
forever
rubbing
him
on
the
back
as
an
honest
but
oppressed
fellow
through
no
fault
of
his
own
you
can
not
possibly
do
a
man
more
harm
than
to
assure
him
that
whatever
he
does
is
right
and
that
whatever
his
enemy
does
is
wrong
but
this
is
what
litch
does
and
he
is
well
paid
for
doing
it
the
farmer
follows
the
furrow
because
he
can
make
more
at
that
than
at
anything
else
he
is
no
more
oppressed
than
other
men
except
as
his
ignorance
makes
it
possible
for
there
never
was
an
age
when
it
was
not
profitable
to
be
sensible
the
world
being
full
of
unscrupulous
men
therefore
the
pretence
that
a
man
can
not
be
honest
except
he
plough
or
sow
for
a
living
is
not
warranted
by
the
facts
getting
up
very
early
in
the
morning
and
going
about
agricultural
work
all
day
in
rough
clothes
does
not
particularly
tend
to
clear
the
conscience
but
because
politicians
who
occasionally
have
use
for
them
have
said
these
things
the
farmers
go
on
accepting
them
stubbornly
refusing
to
be
undeceived
because
it
is
unpleasant
to
acknowledge
ignorance
after
you
have
once
thought
yourself
very
cunning
in
my
time
i
have
harangued
a
meeting
of
farmers
over
the
wrongs
they
were
suffering
at
the
hands
of
miserable
tradesmen
they
call
them
who
did
not
know
one
day
whether
they
would
be
able
to
open
their
doors
the
next
and
received
earnest
applause
after
which
i
got
ten
dollars
for
a
charter
for
an
alliance
which
cost
me
at
the
rate
of
two
dollars
a
thousand
without
difficulty
it
would
not
be
a
greater
confidence
game
were
i
to
borrow
ten
dollars
of
them
to
pay
express
charges
on
the
body
of
a
dead
brother
giving
as
security
a
bogus
bond
for
the
time
a
farmer
spends
attending
alliance
meetings
should
be
spent
at
home
in
reading
an
honest
work
entitled
thieves
exposed
or
the
numerous
devices
men
invent
to
live
without
work
but
they
rather
enjoy
my
lectures
on
the
beauties
of
combination
for
protection
and
the
cheapness
of
alliance
charters
for
i
never
fail
to
relate
how
honest
how
industrious
how
intelligent
and
how
oppressed
they
are
if
they
want
to
pay
big
prices
for
such
comforts
it
is
their
misfortune
i
must
live
and
if
you
say
that
i
am
a
fraud
i
reply
that
all
men
are
frauds
the
lawyers
never
go
to
law
the
doctors
never
take
medicine
the
preachers
seldom
believe
in
religion
and
i
never
farm
the
different
trades
and
professions
are
only
respectable
because
little
is
known
of
them
except
by
those
interested
in
their
profits
and
i
am
no
worse
than
the
rest
of
them
whoever
will
pay
for
being
humbugged
will
find
humbugs
enough
and
the
only
difference
between
me
and
other
professional
men
is
that
i
acknowledge
that
i
am
dishonest
my
position
on
the
reform
question
is
briefly
this
and
i
may
add
that
it
is
the
position
of
every
man
i
am
against
monopolies
until
i
become
a
monopolist
myself
i
am
at
present
engaged
in
the
reform
business
that
i
may
become
a
monopolist
if
i
should
suddenly
become
rich
what
would
i
do
this
refer
to
alliances
as
dangerous
and
such
demagogues
as
myself
as
suspicious
biggs
seemed
to
greatly
enjoy
this
denunciation
of
himself
and
ripped
out
an
oath
or
two
expressive
of
contempt
for
his
victims
our
friend
bilderby
for
example
who
writes
letters
for
your
paper
on
finance
and
who
professes
to
know
all
about
money
in
reality
knows
so
little
about
his
subject
that
he
can
not
earn
a
living
although
he
seems
to
be
constantly
worried
with
the
fear
that
from
a
mistaken
financial
policy
the
government
will
come
to
ruin
in
fact
bilderby
only
gets
time
to
write
his
letters
on
finance
and
make
excuses
to
his
creditors
the
fellow
owes
the
doctor
for
nearly
all
his
children
i
am
certain
he
has
not
paid
for
the
younger
ones
that
is
bilderby
s
way
of
being
a
humbug
i
have
a
different
way
you
have
another
and
there
are
so
many
varieties
that
every
man
is
biggs
was
warming
up
and
unbuttoned
his
collar
to
talk
with
more
freedom
i
see
occasional
notices
in
your
publication
to
the
effect
that
chugg
the
groceryman
or
whatever
the
name
or
the
business
may
be
has
just
returned
from
the
east
which
is
extremely
dull
and
that
he
is
extremely
glad
to
get
back
to
the
enterprising
the
pushing
the
promising
the
noble
and
the
beautiful
west
that
is
your
way
of
being
a
humbug
for
in
reality
chugg
is
glad
to
get
back
to
the
west
because
he
is
of
some
importance
here
and
none
there
the
east
is
full
of
hungry
and
ragged
men
who
are
superior
in
every
way
to
the
prominent
citizen
of
the
name
of
chugg
and
chugg
knows
it
therefore
he
is
glad
to
get
back
where
he
is
looked
upon
as
a
superior
creature
i
have
no
hesitancy
in
saying
privately
that
the
people
in
this
direction
are
not
warranted
in
the
belief
that
all
the
capable
and
energetic
men
have
left
the
east
though
it
would
be
disastrous
to
say
as
much
publicly
when
i
am
in
the
east
it
occurs
to
me
with
great
force
that
the
miles
of
splendid
business
buildings
i
see
on
every
hand
must
be
occupied
by
talented
and
energetic
men
and
as
we
have
no
such
buildings
in
the
west
it
follows
that
we
have
no
such
men
when
i
see
towering
manufactories
swarming
with
operatives
who
would
be
ornaments
to
the
best
society
out
here
i
think
that
at
least
a
few
men
of
energy
and
capacity
have
been
left
to
operate
them
for
ordinary
men
could
not
do
it
i
ride
down
the
long
avenues
of
private
palaces
each
one
of
them
worth
a
township
in
the
smoky
hill
country
and
i
am
convinced
that
we
are
mistaken
in
the
opinion
that
a
man
must
live
on
the
frontier
in
order
to
be
i
had
a
habit
of
scribbling
with
a
pencil
when
idle
and
as
i
picked
up
a
piece
of
paper
to
amuse
myself
in
this
manner
biggs
caught
my
hand
and
said
no
notes
fearing
i
intended
to
publish
his
opinions
he
then
explained
as
he
had
often
done
before
that
he
talked
candidly
to
me
for
my
own
good
and
that
he
would
be
ruined
if
i
quoted
him
either
in
print
or
privately
being
assured
that
i
had
no
such
intention
he
went
on
haven
t
you
noticed
that
when
a
western
man
gets
a
considerable
sum
of
money
together
he
goes
east
to
live
well
what
does
it
mean
except
that
the
good
sense
which
enabled
him
to
make
money
teaches
him
that
the
society
there
is
preferable
to
ours
when
we
go
away
for
recreation
and
pleasure
in
what
direction
do
we
go
east
of
course
because
it
rains
oftener
there
than
here
because
the
caves
the
lakes
the
falls
the
sea
and
the
comforts
are
in
that
direction
if
i
should
get
rich
i
would
leave
this
country
because
i
know
of
another
where
i
could
live
more
comfortably
i
stay
here
because
it
is
to
my
interest
all
of
us
do
and
deserve
no
credit
it
is
rather
humiliating
to
me
than
otherwise
that
i
am
compelled
to
live
where
living
is
cheap
because
i
can
not
afford
the
luxuries
men
who
are
prosperous
or
men
who
live
in
elegant
houses
do
not
come
west
but
it
is
the
unfortunate
the
poor
the
indigent
the
sick
the
lower
classes
in
short
who
came
here
to
grow
up
with
the
country
having
failed
to
grow
up
with
the
country
where
they
came
my
visitor
got
up
at
this
and
without
ceremony
took
his
hat
and
walked
out
giving
me
to
understand
that
i
should
feel
greatly
favored
i
followed
him
soon
afterward
and
passing
along
the
street
i
heard
him
gayly
talking
to
a
crowd
of
men
in
front
of
one
of
the
stores
but
in
a
different
strain
in
fact
he
seemed
to
feel
guilty
for
what
he
had
said
and
was
denying
it
chapter
xxii
a
skeleton
in
the
house
at
erring
s
ford
more
than
three
years
had
passed
since
jo
and
mateel
were
married
and
i
was
alone
on
the
last
night
of
the
year
thinking
that
the
years
were
slipping
away
wonderfully
fast
of
late
it
seemed
so
short
a
time
since
we
had
lived
in
the
country
since
the
rev
john
westlock
so
strangely
disappeared
and
since
i
was
a
boy
in
distress
at
my
own
and
jo
s
misfortunes
the
good
year
was
dying
and
would
soon
pass
peacefully
into
the
dim
past
after
the
watchers
had
tired
of
waiting
and
gone
to
sleep
as
is
the
case
when
an
old
man
dies
the
announcement
is
speedily
followed
by
the
birth
of
a
babe
and
so
the
race
and
the
years
are
continued
as
is
now
said
of
the
dying
year
so
it
will
be
said
of
all
of
us
at
some
time
in
the
mysterious
future
nobody
knows
when
the
hand
that
writes
this
will
be
picking
uneasily
at
the
covering
of
a
and
it
will
be
whispered
in
the
room
and
in
all
the
house
and
down
the
streets
he
is
dying
poor
fellow
he
is
the
eye
that
reads
this
at
some
time
in
the
future
nobody
knows
when
will
become
fixed
and
it
will
be
gently
said
dying
the
front
door
will
be
black
with
crape
for
a
few
days
and
the
people
will
pass
the
house
reverently
and
silently
but
after
a
very
little
while
the
token
of
death
will
be
removed
the
house
will
be
thrown
open
and
aired
and
laughter
will
be
heard
on
the
inside
birds
will
sing
merrily
at
the
front
door
and
flowers
appear
and
happy
children
play
about
the
house
and
through
it
as
though
nothing
had
happened
the
dead
man
may
have
been
dearly
loved
but
everything
and
everybody
encourages
his
friends
to
forget
him
and
they
laugh
in
the
room
where
he
died
and
where
his
coffin
sat
through
the
long
nights
before
the
burial
the
relics
of
departed
friends
which
were
at
first
carefully
laid
away
are
in
the
course
of
months
or
years
resurrected
and
given
to
their
successors
the
hat
worn
by
the
pretty
boy
who
died
last
year
or
the
year
before
is
worn
by
the
boy
who
came
after
him
and
he
plays
with
his
toys
which
were
at
first
so
sacred
as
though
they
had
been
brought
to
the
house
for
him
the
mother
who
put
the
little
hat
away
no
doubt
thought
she
would
keep
it
for
years
and
look
at
it
to
imagine
that
her
was
wearing
it
again
but
time
has
softened
her
grief
friends
told
her
he
was
better
off
and
she
hoped
so
and
tried
to
convince
herself
that
it
was
all
for
the
best
so
it
will
be
with
the
dying
year
it
was
well
loved
while
it
lasted
and
brought
us
many
good
gifts
but
it
will
be
speedily
forgotten
and
in
twelve
months
we
shall
be
equally
indifferent
as
to
its
successor
one
dies
another
is
born
so
go
the
people
and
the
years
there
will
be
a
birth
and
a
death
but
it
is
not
an
uncommon
circumstance
there
will
be
a
little
mourning
for
the
death
but
a
great
deal
of
rejoicing
and
ringing
of
bells
for
the
birth
the
fire
in
the
room
where
i
usually
worked
had
gone
out
and
i
had
taken
my
papers
to
an
inner
room
where
martin
had
worked
late
and
which
was
yet
warm
it
must
have
been
ten
o
clock
and
outside
the
snow
was
falling
steadily
promising
great
drifts
in
the
morning
as
i
could
see
by
the
rays
thrown
out
into
the
darkness
from
the
single
light
which
burned
in
the
room
just
after
i
had
settled
down
comfortably
in
my
chair
some
one
opened
the
front
door
and
stood
on
the
inside
scraping
the
snow
from
his
feet
and
brushing
it
from
his
coat
which
startled
me
for
i
supposed
the
door
to
be
locked
outside
of
the
circle
of
the
lamp
it
was
quite
dark
and
as
the
visitor
came
slowly
toward
me
brushing
the
snow
from
his
clothing
i
was
still
in
doubt
as
to
who
it
was
until
he
stood
almost
beside
me
when
i
saw
with
surprise
that
it
was
jo
erring
of
all
the
men
in
the
world
i
said
getting
up
and
making
a
place
for
him
by
the
fire
you
are
the
most
welcome
i
think
you
must
be
my
new
year
s
gift
for
i
am
lonely
and
was
wishing
you
were
he
held
his
hands
up
to
the
fire
to
warm
them
but
did
not
reply
and
i
noticed
when
he
looked
at
me
that
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
and
swollen
is
there
anything
the
matter
i
asked
now
that
i
was
looking
at
him
closely
i
saw
with
alarm
that
tears
were
in
his
eyes
he
made
no
effort
to
hide
this
but
looked
at
me
as
though
he
would
speak
but
could
not
and
with
a
face
so
pitiful
that
i
became
alarmed
he
still
held
his
hands
up
to
the
fire
to
warm
them
and
i
expected
him
every
moment
to
burst
out
crying
jo
my
old
friend
i
said
to
him
at
last
laying
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
tell
me
the
meaning
of
this
you
distress
and
alarm
turning
his
face
from
the
light
he
remained
a
long
while
in
deep
study
and
finally
got
up
and
walked
to
that
part
of
the
room
which
was
the
darkest
where
he
paced
up
and
down
a
long
time
i
added
wood
to
the
fire
expecting
him
to
sit
down
every
moment
and
tell
me
his
trouble
but
he
continued
his
walk
and
wrapped
his
great
coat
about
him
as
though
he
was
chilled
to
the
heart
at
last
he
turned
suddenly
and
came
over
into
the
light
for
what
i
am
about
to
say
he
said
sitting
down
may
god
forgive
me
for
it
is
a
matter
that
concerns
no
one
but
myself
and
should
forever
remain
a
secret
with
me
but
i
have
thought
of
it
so
much
and
am
so
distressed
from
thinking
of
it
that
i
must
speak
of
it
to
you
or
lose
my
reason
if
i
could
show
you
the
wickedness
in
my
thoughts
you
would
run
away
from
me
in
alarm
but
if
i
could
show
you
my
heart
you
would
weep
over
the
misery
it
contains
it
is
unmanly
for
me
to
tell
you
what
i
came
here
to
tell
but
i
am
so
wretched
that
i
walked
here
through
the
storm
for
the
sympathy
i
am
sure
you
will
give
and
which
i
need
so
much
i
have
not
slept
for
weeks
except
when
nature
asserted
itself
in
spite
of
my
misery
but
through
all
the
long
nights
i
have
tumbled
and
tossed
about
thinking
of
the
matter
in
a
different
light
at
every
turn
hoping
to
get
some
comfort
out
of
it
but
every
new
thought
of
it
seems
the
worst
of
all
i
came
out
of
the
house
to
cool
my
hot
head
and
walking
towards
you
caused
me
to
resolve
to
come
on
and
freeze
myself
into
forgetfulness
mateel
does
not
know
where
i
am
and
i
must
go
back
as
i
came
but
i
would
rather
walk
alone
in
this
storm
than
trust
myself
in
a
darkened
room
with
my
thoughts
i
am
sick
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
but
it
is
from
thinking
of
the
matter
i
came
to
tell
you
about
for
it
has
taken
such
possession
of
me
that
even
sleep
is
denied
i
was
so
distressed
and
alarmed
that
i
could
not
say
a
word
but
tried
to
appear
natural
by
digging
at
the
fire
after
jo
had
thought
awhile
he
continued
i
need
not
rehearse
the
story
of
my
courtship
and
marriage
you
are
familiar
with
that
and
you
know
that
i
have
been
very
contented
and
happy
except
that
ever
since
i
have
known
mateel
i
have
noticed
an
indifference
which
often
humiliated
me
but
which
i
have
excused
for
a
hundred
reasons
and
tried
to
think
little
of
the
letter
which
i
will
shortly
ask
you
to
read
explains
it
all
and
it
is
this
which
has
changed
me
into
a
wicked
worthless
man
without
hope
or
ambition
the
letter
was
written
by
mateel
to
clinton
bragg
when
she
was
his
promised
wife
before
they
came
to
fairview
and
i
received
it
by
mail
addressed
in
a
strange
hand
six
weeks
ago
yesterday
on
an
evening
when
i
was
planning
for
the
future
and
when
i
was
in
unusual
good
spirits
that
she
had
been
engaged
to
bragg
i
never
knew
nor
did
i
suspect
it
for
although
i
knew
they
were
brought
up
in
the
same
neighborhood
and
had
been
children
together
the
thought
never
occurred
to
me
that
they
had
been
lovers
for
he
is
more
fit
for
a
hangman
s
rope
than
for
an
honest
woman
s
regard
i
know
now
that
mateel
has
never
loved
me
as
the
letter
indicates
she
loved
the
most
contemptible
man
i
ever
knew
a
hundred
times
i
have
wondered
if
there
were
no
better
lovers
in
the
world
than
mateel
but
i
have
found
that
the
trouble
was
that
she
had
drained
her
heart
dry
in
loving
my
enemy
and
that
there
was
none
left
for
me
this
is
what
has
wounded
my
pride
and
broken
my
spirits
and
left
me
a
useless
he
took
from
an
inner
pocket
and
handed
me
an
envelope
and
taking
from
it
the
letter
i
began
to
read
aloud
read
it
to
yourself
he
said
i
am
familiar
with
the
letter
was
closely
written
and
read
as
follows
my
brave
lover
i
write
to
tell
you
for
the
hundredth
time
how
much
i
love
you
when
you
are
away
from
me
i
have
no
other
pleasure
than
this
for
it
brings
you
to
me
to
receive
my
kisses
and
embraces
once
you
came
in
the
middle
of
the
day
following
the
night
i
wrote
you
and
if
you
come
and
sincerely
believe
and
never
forget
what
i
have
to
say
this
letter
will
have
accomplished
its
mission
what
i
want
to
say
is
and
i
write
it
after
a
great
deal
of
serious
deliberation
that
if
by
an
unlucky
chance
we
should
never
be
married
i
should
still
love
you
as
i
do
now
forever
i
love
you
so
much
that
i
am
anxious
you
should
know
that
even
though
i
believed
you
had
forgotten
me
and
i
became
the
wife
of
some
one
else
because
all
women
are
expected
to
marry
i
should
continue
to
think
of
you
as
i
do
now
the
only
man
worthy
of
my
love
in
all
the
world
and
every
night
after
my
husband
had
gone
to
sleep
i
would
put
my
arms
around
him
and
imagine
that
it
was
you
and
that
you
would
waken
soon
and
love
me
as
i
am
sure
you
do
this
night
i
want
you
to
believe
this
for
it
is
written
with
absolute
sincerity
and
if
my
hope
of
the
future
should
never
be
realized
please
read
this
over
and
over
again
and
feel
that
i
am
married
only
in
penance
for
being
unworthy
of
you
wherever
i
am
and
whatever
my
condition
i
beg
of
you
to
remember
that
i
love
only
you
that
i
will
never
love
any
one
else
and
that
with
my
last
breath
i
will
tenderly
speak
your
name
i
do
not
believe
god
will
be
so
cruel
as
to
separate
us
but
if
he
should
the
knowledge
that
you
knew
i
continued
to
love
you
would
make
my
loss
easier
to
bear
if
i
should
consent
to
be
married
it
would
be
to
some
one
who
cared
for
nothing
but
my
promise
to
live
with
him
and
if
i
could
call
him
up
from
the
future
now
to
stand
beside
me
i
would
bravely
tell
him
that
i
love
only
clinton
bragg
and
that
though
my
mind
may
change
my
heart
never
will
if
i
should
be
so
unfortunate
as
to
have
a
husband
other
than
you
i
would
be
dutiful
and
just
to
him
but
my
love
i
would
reserve
until
i
met
you
in
heaven
when
realizing
how
perfect
it
is
you
would
accept
it
loving
you
always
i
folded
the
letter
and
handed
it
back
to
him
and
as
it
touched
his
fingers
he
shuddered
as
though
overtaken
by
a
chill
the
very
touch
of
it
penetrates
my
marrow
he
said
after
putting
it
away
in
his
pocket
as
though
it
were
but
for
all
my
dread
of
its
infamous
contents
i
have
read
it
a
hundred
times
if
i
am
tossing
about
at
night
unable
to
sleep
from
thinking
of
it
i
can
not
help
making
a
light
and
reading
it
did
you
ever
talk
to
her
about
it
i
asked
and
i
am
sure
i
was
trembling
all
over
for
i
felt
that
jo
erring
with
all
his
prospects
was
now
a
wreck
and
would
never
be
himself
again
not
about
this
directly
he
answered
but
she
has
told
me
that
she
was
engaged
to
bragg
she
treated
it
so
coolly
that
i
thought
perhaps
such
things
are
common
and
that
i
am
unreasonable
to
feel
as
i
do
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
ways
of
good
society
it
may
be
that
love
is
only
an
amusement
to
be
indulged
in
with
every
agreeable
person
it
may
be
that
a
woman
is
none
the
less
a
true
woman
for
having
been
caressed
and
fondled
by
different
men
and
that
it
is
no
fault
for
a
young
girl
to
spend
half
a
night
with
a
lover
who
is
liable
to
be
succeeded
in
a
month
by
another
but
if
such
is
the
social
creed
something
convinces
me
that
society
is
wrong
and
that
my
revolting
manhood
is
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
walked
up
and
down
in
the
dark
part
of
the
room
again
and
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
what
biggs
had
said
that
every
one
has
a
private
history
i
do
not
know
who
broke
the
engagement
he
said
returning
to
the
fire
at
last
but
i
have
evidence
in
this
letter
that
it
was
not
mateel
therefore
it
is
fair
to
suppose
that
the
insolent
dog
who
sent
this
tired
of
the
contract
and
broke
it
off
the
girl
was
no
doubt
and
was
brought
west
with
the
hope
that
she
would
encounter
an
ignorant
fellow
with
industrious
habits
but
no
sensibility
who
could
comfortably
support
her
until
old
age
and
death
came
to
the
relief
of
her
heart
but
who
could
never
hope
to
have
her
love
for
that
she
had
given
already
although
it
was
not
wanted
through
the
cruel
neglect
of
god
i
became
the
man
who
is
expected
to
labor
early
and
late
that
she
may
be
made
as
comfortable
as
possible
in
her
affliction
i
receive
nothing
in
return
for
this
except
the
knowledge
that
as
another
man
did
not
want
her
love
i
may
have
her
to
care
for
as
her
family
is
not
and
somebody
must
do
it
whenever
i
knock
at
my
heart
s
door
it
is
opened
by
a
skeleton
hand
and
this
letter
handed
out
to
me
if
ambition
beckons
to
me
now
the
fleshless
fingers
of
an
inexorable
devil
hold
me
back
and
instead
of
pushing
on
i
sit
down
and
cry
that
i
have
been
so
disgraced
through
no
fault
of
my
own
they
thought
i
was
a
rough
country
boy
lacking
so
delicate
a
thing
as
a
heart
and
that
i
would
be
content
with
a
broken
flower
because
it
had
once
been
very
beautiful
i
doubt
if
they
thought
of
me
at
all
except
that
i
was
industrious
and
healthy
as
all
the
consideration
was
for
mateel
who
had
been
wounded
and
i
listened
to
the
wind
blowing
on
the
outside
and
i
thought
it
was
more
mournful
than
i
had
ever
heard
it
before
i
can
not
tell
you
how
much
my
marriage
to
mateel
would
have
done
for
me
had
this
letter
never
been
written
for
i
should
have
divined
its
existence
though
it
had
never
fallen
in
my
way
before
i
read
it
i
was
as
happy
as
it
is
possible
for
a
man
to
be
though
the
fear
often
oppressed
me
that
a
dark
shadow
would
fall
across
my
path
for
i
had
always
been
taught
to
believe
that
great
sorrow
followed
great
happiness
the
shadow
has
come
and
the
devils
are
probably
content
with
its
black
intensity
i
was
proud
that
the
home
i
had
provided
for
mateel
was
better
than
any
she
had
ever
lived
in
before
and
was
kind
and
careful
of
her
that
she
might
bless
the
day
we
met
i
was
proud
to
be
known
as
a
progressing
growing
man
that
her
father
might
be
proud
of
me
as
he
knew
how
hard
my
boyhood
was
but
i
see
now
that
they
all
regarded
me
as
a
convenience
a
trusty
packhorse
of
great
endurance
and
i
know
that
my
years
of
work
for
mateel
were
not
worthy
of
a
man
s
ambition
i
can
never
tell
you
though
i
would
willingly
if
i
could
how
great
is
the
burden
i
must
bear
from
this
time
forward
hope
has
been
killed
within
me
except
hope
to
die
and
my
ambition
has
been
cruelly
trampled
upon
and
killed
by
a
man
i
never
he
sat
crouching
before
the
fire
like
a
man
who
had
been
beaten
without
cause
by
superior
numbers
and
who
felt
humiliated
because
his
oppressors
had
escaped
and
he
could
not
be
avenged
upon
them
until
six
weeks
ago
mateel
was
a
perfect
woman
in
my
eyes
and
the
queen
of
my
heart
but
since
that
time
i
have
begun
to
criticise
her
to
myself
she
does
not
know
it
and
if
i
become
an
indifferent
husband
the
fault
is
her
own
i
can
not
be
the
same
as
i
was
before
for
i
shall
be
inclined
to
look
upon
her
simply
as
the
convenience
she
undertook
to
become
instead
of
my
wife
if
she
fails
to
be
convenient
and
i
fear
i
shall
be
a
hard
critic
i
can
not
help
observing
it
in
my
present
state
of
mind
though
i
shall
remark
it
only
to
myself
she
has
deliberately
deceived
me
but
in
spite
of
it
i
love
her
and
every
brings
me
word
that
it
is
not
returned
the
very
wheels
in
the
mill
give
voice
to
her
entreaty
to
bragg
to
remember
that
she
will
never
love
me
every
sound
mocks
me
that
my
wife
is
proud
of
her
love
for
another
and
piteously
begs
that
it
may
never
be
forgotten
since
reading
the
letter
i
have
never
kissed
my
wife
or
put
my
arms
about
her
and
i
hope
god
may
strike
me
dead
if
ever
i
do
either
he
stood
up
in
great
excitement
as
if
calling
on
god
to
witness
his
oath
but
as
if
recalling
something
he
meekly
sat
down
again
and
continued
in
a
subdued
tone
i
have
apologized
to
her
for
my
conduct
for
she
seems
distressed
about
it
and
promised
that
perhaps
i
would
think
better
of
it
after
a
while
but
i
never
shall
it
is
growing
worse
with
me
and
i
tremble
when
i
think
of
my
future
i
talk
with
her
about
the
old
affair
with
bragg
over
and
over
again
hoping
it
was
not
so
bad
as
i
think
she
is
very
truthful
and
candid
and
reluctantly
answers
every
question
however
searching
it
may
be
but
the
more
i
talk
of
it
the
worse
it
gets
don
t
imagine
from
what
i
have
said
that
she
was
ever
anything
but
a
virtuous
girl
but
she
once
loved
that
man
so
madly
that
she
denounced
me
before
she
had
seen
me
the
fresh
and
innocent
affection
which
i
should
have
had
was
given
to
bragg
he
had
the
fragrance
of
the
rose
i
have
the
withered
leaves
after
he
tired
of
its
beauty
and
tossed
it
away
you
can
imagine
the
scenes
between
two
young
people
who
passionately
love
each
other
and
who
only
delay
marriage
until
a
convenient
time
if
you
can
not
i
can
and
it
is
this
imagination
which
never
leaves
me
and
to
add
to
my
wretchedness
bragg
throws
himself
in
my
way
as
often
as
possible
that
i
may
contemplate
the
man
who
was
worthy
of
the
woman
i
am
not
the
time
may
come
when
i
would
give
my
life
to
take
him
by
the
throat
and
if
ever
it
does
there
will
be
murder
done
for
with
my
hands
once
upon
him
i
would
tear
him
into
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
in
reply
for
i
could
think
of
nothing
that
would
comfort
him
and
though
i
knew
he
would
never
again
need
my
friendship
as
he
needed
it
then
this
knowledge
only
confused
me
and
made
me
stammer
when
i
attempted
to
put
in
a
word
he
seemed
to
have
so
thoroughly
considered
the
matter
that
there
was
no
defence
and
stated
it
so
candidly
that
i
thought
he
only
expected
me
to
pity
him
jo
i
said
as
the
thought
occurred
to
me
you
undoubtedly
received
this
letter
from
bragg
no
one
else
would
be
malicious
enough
to
send
it
are
you
certain
he
did
not
write
it
a
new
hope
sprang
into
his
eyes
though
i
noticed
that
his
hand
paused
on
its
way
to
the
pocket
which
contained
the
letter
as
though
it
was
of
no
use
to
look
but
he
unfolded
the
letter
with
trembling
hands
and
studied
it
with
great
care
spending
so
much
time
over
it
that
i
hoped
we
should
have
occasion
to
go
out
and
find
the
scoundrel
and
beat
him
but
after
jo
had
finished
his
inspection
i
saw
that
he
was
satisfied
that
the
letter
was
written
by
mateel
that
it
might
be
a
forgery
never
occurred
to
me
before
he
said
with
a
long
sigh
but
it
is
genuine
there
is
no
i
need
not
tell
you
my
dear
old
friend
i
said
that
i
am
sorry
this
has
happened
i
regret
it
so
much
that
i
am
powerless
to
comfort
you
if
that
were
possible
your
tears
have
unmanned
i
want
to
apologize
for
my
future
he
said
after
a
long
silence
for
i
no
longer
have
ambition
i
can
never
succeed
now
and
i
want
you
to
know
why
if
i
do
not
advance
in
the
future
i
desire
that
my
only
friend
know
that
i
no
longer
care
to
advance
that
i
have
no
reason
to
wish
for
success
and
that
i
am
not
trying
if
i
become
a
fairview
man
miserable
and
silent
without
hope
or
ambition
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
am
not
to
blame
i
have
just
such
a
business
and
just
such
a
home
as
we
pictured
together
when
we
were
boys
i
have
proved
to
you
that
i
did
not
my
strength
and
if
i
do
not
progress
now
that
i
am
a
man
you
will
know
that
my
strength
has
been
broken
the
home
i
built
with
so
much
care
is
distasteful
to
me
the
business
i
own
after
such
a
struggle
i
hate
and
i
want
you
to
know
that
while
i
have
not
tired
of
working
i
no
longer
care
to
succeed
the
one
above
all
others
who
should
have
helped
me
has
only
brought
me
disgrace
and
broken
my
heart
there
was
no
contract
between
us
but
when
mateel
became
my
promised
wife
i
made
a
vow
to
accomplish
what
i
have
i
have
succeeded
but
she
has
succeeded
in
nothing
except
to
bring
me
this
letter
and
its
humiliating
contents
i
would
not
be
a
successful
man
in
the
future
if
i
could
bragg
will
finally
become
a
beggar
for
he
is
a
spendthrift
and
loafer
and
i
believe
that
she
would
use
my
means
to
help
him
i
would
rather
be
poor
than
rich
for
if
i
should
die
possessed
of
property
that
scoundrel
would
overcome
his
former
scruples
and
marry
my
widow
my
ambition
in
the
future
will
be
to
live
long
and
die
poor
i
hope
the
devil
is
satisfied
he
has
been
after
me
a
long
while
and
i
have
passed
into
his
possession
body
and
soul
but
i
must
return
home
he
said
as
if
remembering
the
hour
mateel
does
not
know
where
i
am
though
i
suspect
she
does
not
care
and
is
soundly
how
are
you
going
i
asked
as
he
got
up
and
began
buttoning
his
great
coat
around
him
as
i
came
on
he
started
to
walk
past
me
and
would
have
gone
away
had
i
not
held
him
back
is
saturday
and
new
year
i
said
it
is
a
holiday
and
i
will
go
with
you
wait
here
until
i
come
he
consented
without
a
word
and
sat
down
and
i
think
did
not
change
his
position
until
i
came
back
with
the
horses
it
was
an
hour
after
midnight
and
the
cold
was
intense
a
miserable
night
for
such
a
ride
but
i
willingly
undertook
it
knowing
it
was
a
kindness
to
jo
and
that
we
could
easily
make
the
distance
in
an
hour
when
i
told
my
mother
that
i
was
going
to
fairview
she
was
not
surprised
nor
did
she
ask
me
any
questions
and
i
was
soon
on
the
way
with
jo
by
my
side
when
we
drove
up
to
the
house
at
the
mill
which
we
did
after
a
cold
ride
without
speaking
a
word
i
saw
a
curtain
pulled
aside
in
a
room
where
there
was
a
light
and
mateel
s
pale
and
frightened
face
peering
out
but
by
the
time
she
appeared
at
the
door
and
opened
it
we
had
passed
on
to
the
stables
and
were
putting
away
the
horses
i
was
chilled
through
with
cold
but
when
we
walked
back
toward
the
house
i
am
certain
i
shivered
because
i
dreaded
to
see
them
meet
knowing
how
unhappy
and
how
helpless
both
were
i
opened
the
door
and
we
walked
in
together
jo
a
little
behind
me
and
we
went
direct
to
the
fire
though
i
stopped
and
held
out
my
hand
to
his
frightened
wife
she
was
very
pale
and
i
knew
she
had
been
weeping
for
her
eyes
were
red
and
swollen
while
she
took
my
hat
and
coat
jo
took
off
his
and
held
his
hands
out
to
the
fire
as
he
had
done
when
he
came
to
see
me
in
town
he
had
taken
a
hasty
glance
at
his
wife
and
i
thought
her
distress
added
to
his
own
as
though
now
both
were
wretched
and
nobody
to
blame
for
it
jo
my
husband
she
said
in
a
piteous
hesitating
tone
and
almost
crying
what
has
happened
you
look
so
strange
i
have
been
walking
the
floor
since
eight
o
clock
waiting
for
you
is
there
anything
the
matter
as
jo
did
not
reply
she
looked
at
me
for
an
answer
and
i
said
he
had
business
in
town
which
occupied
him
until
late
and
that
knowing
she
would
be
worried
i
had
brought
him
home
but
this
did
not
satisfy
her
and
walking
over
to
jo
she
stood
beside
him
why
don
t
you
speak
to
me
you
have
never
treated
me
this
way
as
she
stood
trembling
beside
him
i
thought
that
surely
jo
s
letter
was
a
forgery
and
that
if
she
did
not
love
her
husband
a
woman
never
did
looking
up
at
her
as
though
half
ashamed
jo
said
you
know
why
i
went
out
of
the
house
it
is
nothing
more
than
that
you
say
it
is
not
mateel
walked
over
to
a
chair
near
me
i
thought
she
staggered
as
she
went
and
sat
down
and
her
face
was
so
pale
and
frightened
that
i
felt
sure
jo
wronged
her
when
he
said
she
did
not
care
we
sat
there
so
long
in
silence
that
i
began
wondering
who
would
first
speak
and
what
would
be
said
and
whether
it
would
clear
up
this
distressing
matter
when
i
glanced
at
mateel
i
saw
despair
and
helplessness
written
in
her
face
and
determined
to
go
to
bed
and
leave
them
alone
hoping
they
would
talk
it
over
and
forget
it
jo
saw
my
intention
and
motioned
me
back
you
say
it
is
not
serious
he
said
glancing
hurriedly
at
his
wife
as
if
afraid
that
if
he
looked
in
her
face
and
saw
its
distress
his
stubborn
heart
would
relent
so
much
so
as
to
commit
the
unpardonable
offense
of
taking
her
in
his
arms
therefore
you
will
not
care
that
i
have
told
ned
i
have
talked
to
him
more
freely
than
to
you
i
went
to
town
for
that
had
my
life
depended
upon
it
i
could
not
have
told
which
one
i
pitied
most
as
i
know
you
to
be
a
truthful
woman
he
went
on
after
a
long
pause
and
you
say
it
is
not
serious
i
believe
that
you
think
so
but
it
is
all
the
more
unfortunate
on
that
account
for
it
is
a
very
grave
matter
to
me
i
can
never
explain
to
you
fully
why
i
take
it
so
much
to
heart
because
i
should
wound
your
feelings
in
doing
it
but
the
change
in
me
within
six
weeks
will
convince
you
that
if
i
am
unreasonable
about
it
i
can
not
help
it
and
that
my
pride
has
been
humbled
and
my
spirit
broken
by
a
circumstance
for
which
you
are
probably
not
to
blame
when
everything
is
considered
it
is
unmanly
in
me
to
feel
as
i
do
and
i
apologize
to
you
that
i
have
not
manhood
sufficient
if
that
is
a
reasonable
excuse
to
shake
off
a
circumstance
which
will
affect
my
future
but
which
you
regard
as
trifling
i
have
loved
you
and
i
do
yet
it
is
nothing
to
me
what
those
i
do
not
care
for
have
been
i
have
loved
you
with
my
whole
heart
and
i
have
never
divided
my
affection
with
anyone
if
i
except
an
honest
friendship
for
my
sister
s
son
and
who
was
the
sole
companion
of
my
wretched
boyhood
but
the
more
i
love
you
the
more
unhappy
i
am
this
is
my
unfortunate
dilemma
and
i
only
mention
it
because
the
serious
truth
must
be
known
although
it
nearly
killed
me
i
asked
you
never
to
show
me
affection
until
i
felt
differently
i
did
this
because
i
believed
you
learned
to
be
affectionate
with
a
man
i
hate
and
that
you
can
never
show
me
an
act
of
kindness
you
did
not
show
him
and
which
your
love
for
him
taught
you
no
woman
s
lips
ever
touched
mine
my
only
sister
s
alone
excepted
and
hers
not
frequently
until
yours
did
my
mind
was
never
occupied
with
thoughts
of
love
until
i
met
you
and
now
that
i
know
you
only
consented
to
marry
me
because
you
could
not
be
better
suited
my
simple
affection
is
hurt
i
know
that
you
care
for
me
in
a
fashion
so
you
do
for
every
one
who
is
kind
to
you
but
i
wanted
the
affection
you
gave
him
your
first
and
best
i
feel
debased
that
this
affair
has
ruined
me
for
it
has
completely
and
i
can
no
longer
look
an
honest
man
in
the
face
for
against
my
will
i
am
an
indifferent
husband
instead
of
the
worthy
one
i
hoped
to
become
i
was
brought
up
in
a
community
where
the
women
were
overworked
imposed
upon
and
unhappy
i
resolved
to
make
my
wife
a
notable
exception
to
this
rule
but
i
can
not
now
and
i
feel
the
disgrace
the
pale
fretful
women
of
fairview
who
talked
in
the
church
of
their
heavy
crosses
to
bear
and
sat
down
crying
passed
before
me
in
procession
and
staggering
behind
them
with
the
heaviest
cross
of
all
was
mateel
i
was
so
particular
to
tell
you
how
i
felt
about
this
matter
before
we
were
married
jo
went
on
still
looking
into
the
fire
though
i
spoke
of
it
then
only
to
convince
you
that
i
was
a
good
lover
for
i
did
not
suspect
that
you
regarded
me
as
a
victim
instead
of
a
man
i
talked
of
it
seriously
that
you
might
know
i
was
in
earnest
and
much
as
i
loved
you
had
i
known
this
i
would
have
given
you
up
at
the
last
moment
there
might
have
been
a
remedy
for
it
then
there
is
none
now
as
i
have
been
during
the
past
six
weeks
so
shall
i
be
as
long
as
i
live
except
that
i
shall
grow
more
bitter
and
resentful
it
is
cruel
that
i
have
been
mercilessly
ruined
and
nobody
to
blame
for
it
were
i
injured
in
any
other
way
there
would
be
some
one
to
punish
and
amends
to
be
made
but
in
this
no
wrong
has
been
done
indeed
i
suppose
i
who
am
so
grievously
injured
am
more
to
blame
than
any
one
else
for
being
so
absurd
i
am
certain
every
one
will
regard
it
in
this
way
although
that
will
not
help
the
matter
so
far
as
i
am
there
were
evidences
of
bitterness
in
his
words
now
rather
than
of
sadness
and
regret
and
he
looked
around
the
room
fiercely
as
though
he
would
do
something
desperate
to
those
who
had
injured
him
but
he
soon
began
thinking
again
and
went
on
talking
i
speak
frankly
only
that
we
may
understand
each
other
for
it
grieves
me
to
do
it
it
is
not
a
pleasure
for
me
to
command
you
never
to
touch
me
again
during
the
short
time
we
have
lived
apart
on
account
of
this
unfortunate
matter
i
have
prayed
every
night
that
you
would
come
to
me
though
i
had
locked
my
door
so
you
could
not
when
my
heart
finally
breaks
it
will
be
because
you
no
longer
come
to
me
though
i
will
not
let
you
one
night
i
became
so
distracted
thinking
of
your
unhappiness
as
well
as
my
own
that
i
stole
softly
into
your
room
intending
to
kiss
away
your
tears
and
ask
you
to
forgive
my
unintended
cruelty
but
i
found
you
quietly
sleeping
and
i
will
swear
that
by
the
light
of
my
lamp
i
saw
you
smiling
i
will
swear
that
you
spoke
the
name
of
clinton
and
i
went
back
to
my
room
determined
to
kill
him
and
then
myself
but
my
cowardly
heart
it
was
never
cowardly
before
failed
me
and
i
could
only
become
more
ugly
and
from
the
manner
in
which
mateel
started
at
this
i
believed
she
had
only
gone
to
sleep
when
completely
exhausted
and
that
she
had
only
spoken
the
name
because
she
was
familiar
with
it
as
she
was
familiar
with
a
thousand
others
but
the
circumstance
seemed
only
to
convince
her
that
everything
was
against
her
and
that
explanations
would
be
useless
but
as
if
trying
to
avoid
the
subject
she
asked
without
looking
up
since
you
have
told
ned
what
does
he
think
i
am
not
a
competent
judge
i
answered
hurriedly
sorry
that
she
had
appealed
to
me
at
all
for
i
could
think
of
no
comfort
for
either
of
them
i
can
only
say
that
i
have
so
much
confidence
in
your
husband
that
i
do
not
question
his
sorrow
it
is
enough
for
me
to
know
that
he
is
unhappy
though
if
i
should
advise
him
it
would
be
to
try
to
forget
the
world
is
full
of
difficulties
which
have
no
other
remedy
than
this
though
they
are
seldom
forgotten
i
have
always
known
that
jo
was
just
such
a
man
as
he
has
shown
himself
to
be
i
remember
distinctly
how
gloomy
he
became
in
talking
about
it
the
evening
i
first
went
to
your
house
with
him
and
how
it
changed
his
disposition
and
i
remember
how
gayly
you
laughed
at
it
as
if
it
were
of
no
consequence
i
have
always
been
jo
s
friend
i
always
shall
be
and
am
his
friend
in
she
did
not
look
up
but
kept
gazing
at
the
fire
as
she
had
done
before
it
is
my
most
serious
fault
that
i
did
not
tell
him
of
it
before
we
were
married
but
i
was
timid
and
thought
of
it
only
as
one
of
the
many
little
regrets
with
which
every
life
is
filled
and
neglected
it
i
could
not
love
my
husband
more
than
i
do
and
i
only
failed
to
tell
him
of
it
because
i
feared
it
would
give
him
unnecessary
pain
i
was
but
sixteen
then
a
without
serious
thought
or
purpose
and
certainly
every
one
of
my
companions
was
as
guilty
as
i
if
it
can
be
called
guilt
it
is
not
necessary
for
me
to
make
explanations
for
he
has
given
me
notice
that
they
will
not
be
accepted
but
if
there
is
anything
i
can
do
to
make
atonement
no
difference
what
it
is
even
to
going
away
from
him
and
dying
alone
and
neglected
i
will
gladly
do
it
and
humble
myself
cheerfully
if
that
course
will
relieve
him
i
have
so
much
confidence
in
my
husband
that
i
do
not
question
the
honesty
of
his
grief
and
for
his
sake
i
regret
my
past
in
justice
to
my
womanhood
i
can
not
say
i
am
ashamed
of
it
if
i
mentioned
a
name
which
was
obnoxious
to
my
husband
in
my
sleep
it
was
because
the
name
had
caused
me
trouble
i
do
not
remember
it
for
since
this
unhappy
change
in
our
home
i
have
been
ill
and
worn
out
i
was
never
strong
but
i
am
so
weak
now
as
to
be
jo
seemed
to
not
pay
the
slightest
attention
while
his
wife
was
talking
for
he
kept
his
eyes
on
the
floor
but
that
he
was
listening
intently
i
knew
very
well
mateel
looked
at
him
timidly
when
she
had
finished
as
if
expecting
a
reply
but
as
he
made
none
she
too
looked
at
the
floor
i
watched
her
face
narrowly
and
there
saw
depicted
such
misery
as
i
can
never
forget
she
seemed
to
realize
that
she
had
made
her
husband
unhappy
by
a
thoughtless
act
and
to
realize
her
utter
inability
to
supply
a
remedy
i
think
a
more
ingenious
woman
could
have
made
a
more
cautious
statement
though
not
a
more
honest
one
and
won
her
husband
back
by
explanations
but
mateel
as
was
the
case
with
her
father
gave
up
at
once
on
the
approach
of
a
difficulty
and
prepared
for
the
worst
i
saw
in
her
face
that
she
would
never
be
able
to
effect
a
reconciliation
for
believing
it
to
be
hopeless
she
would
be
dumb
in
contemplating
the
life
they
would
lead
in
future
i
knew
she
would
be
kind
and
attentive
and
hope
for
the
best
but
in
her
fright
and
consternation
she
could
not
gather
strength
to
test
her
ingenuity
i
knew
that
she
would
accept
her
husband
s
increasing
obstinacy
as
evidence
that
a
great
calamity
had
come
upon
their
house
and
meekly
submit
instead
of
resolving
to
conquer
and
triumph
over
it
if
she
had
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
then
as
he
wanted
her
to
do
in
spite
of
his
commands
to
the
contrary
and
between
declarations
of
her
love
asked
him
to
give
her
a
year
in
which
to
prove
her
devotion
and
explain
away
the
unhappy
past
i
believe
this
story
would
never
have
been
written
but
they
misunderstood
each
other
at
the
beginning
and
continued
it
until
the
end
i
could
see
also
that
jo
regarded
what
she
had
said
as
a
sort
of
justification
of
her
course
thus
widening
and
deepening
the
gulf
between
them
and
i
became
so
uncomfortable
that
i
walked
the
floor
to
collect
myself
but
i
could
not
think
of
anything
which
if
expressed
would
help
them
and
i
became
more
uncomfortable
still
when
i
reflected
that
they
would
accept
my
embarrassment
as
an
evidence
that
i
thought
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
except
the
worst
that
could
be
done
i
sat
down
then
determined
to
speak
of
the
matter
lightly
but
a
look
at
them
convinced
me
that
this
would
be
mockery
therefore
i
changed
my
mind
and
said
i
would
go
to
bed
this
seemed
to
startle
them
both
as
though
they
dreaded
to
be
left
alone
and
jo
asked
as
a
favor
that
i
stay
with
him
if
you
leave
that
chair
he
said
a
devil
will
occupy
it
and
stare
at
me
until
i
replied
that
i
only
thought
of
going
to
bed
to
leave
them
alone
because
i
felt
like
an
intruder
and
was
not
at
all
sleepy
and
in
response
to
his
request
i
stirred
the
fire
and
sat
down
between
them
occasionally
i
dozed
but
on
waking
again
i
found
them
sitting
on
either
side
of
the
fire
as
far
apart
as
possible
as
my
grandfather
and
grandmother
had
done
before
them
i
felt
that
all
had
been
said
that
could
be
said
and
although
once
or
twice
i
broke
the
silence
by
some
commonplace
remark
neither
of
them
replied
further
than
to
look
up
as
if
imploring
me
not
to
go
to
sleep
again
and
leave
them
alone
i
thought
the
night
would
never
end
but
at
last
the
room
began
to
grow
lighter
and
when
the
sun
came
up
over
the
woods
its
first
rays
looked
in
upon
two
faces
so
haggard
and
worn
that
i
wondered
whether
it
did
not
pity
them
the
sun
came
up
higher
yet
but
still
they
sat
there
and
the
curtains
being
down
and
the
shutters
closed
i
thought
the
sunlight
had
deserted
that
house
and
given
it
over
to
gloom
and
despair
chapter
xxiii
the
shadow
in
the
smoky
hills
although
i
began
my
career
as
an
editor
with
a
good
deal
of
enthusiasm
in
the
course
of
two
or
three
years
i
became
so
tired
of
the
work
that
i
longed
to
give
away
the
establishment
that
i
might
have
a
month
s
rest
i
have
since
wondered
that
i
did
not
follow
the
example
of
the
founder
of
the
union
of
states
and
run
off
as
i
came
to
regard
myself
as
filling
the
station
that
my
father
stormed
and
my
mother
cried
because
i
could
not
fill
in
my
youth
not
being
a
girl
for
as
a
kitchen
maid
only
cleans
dishes
that
they
may
be
soiled
again
so
it
seemed
that
we
only
set
up
the
types
and
inked
them
that
we
might
wash
and
tear
them
down
and
begin
all
over
again
it
was
peculiar
to
my
business
that
the
people
could
see
at
the
end
of
every
week
all
that
had
been
accomplished
and
it
was
usually
so
little
though
i
did
the
best
i
could
that
i
felt
ashamed
of
it
and
dreaded
to
see
a
stranger
pick
up
the
union
of
states
in
my
presence
for
fear
he
would
not
know
my
connection
with
it
and
make
unfavorable
comment
i
frequently
left
a
public
place
on
this
account
and
i
never
came
suddenly
upon
a
knot
of
men
that
i
did
not
hurriedly
announce
my
presence
so
that
if
they
were
pointing
out
the
most
glaring
defects
of
the
paper
they
could
spare
me
the
humiliation
of
listening
to
them
other
trades
and
professions
are
more
secret
and
their
contemptible
transactions
generously
hid
from
the
public
but
all
my
work
had
to
be
submitted
to
the
criticism
of
every
idle
vagrant
who
cared
to
pick
up
the
sheet
a
lawyer
or
a
merchant
might
lock
himself
up
in
his
office
and
pretend
to
be
engaged
in
grave
affairs
while
really
idling
time
away
but
if
i
had
attempted
it
the
deception
would
have
been
apparent
at
once
public
attention
is
always
called
to
a
newspaper
for
otherwise
it
can
not
prosper
and
so
the
people
are
usually
disgusted
when
they
realize
how
little
a
man
can
do
papers
of
the
class
i
published
were
not
popular
other
men
s
affairs
were
equally
contemptible
but
they
were
charitably
hid
from
the
public
gaze
whereas
mine
were
regarded
as
common
property
and
fault
found
accordingly
i
did
not
know
then
though
i
have
since
found
it
out
that
what
one
complains
of
will
please
another
so
that
when
a
paper
makes
an
enemy
it
makes
a
friend
with
the
same
paragraph
though
the
enemy
takes
more
pains
to
talk
about
it
than
the
gentleman
who
is
quietly
delighted
it
is
my
opinion
that
to
become
too
well
known
is
dangerous
for
under
such
circumstances
your
faults
are
common
property
and
your
insignificance
proverbial
and
a
man
who
writes
long
for
a
newspaper
will
inevitably
show
every
weakness
of
which
he
is
possessed
each
week
i
laid
before
the
people
every
thought
every
idea
and
every
suggestion
i
was
possessed
of
and
became
so
tired
of
being
criticised
that
i
would
have
given
ten
years
of
my
life
for
half
a
year
s
vacation
when
martin
grew
tired
he
was
at
first
a
valuable
assistant
but
his
enthusiasm
like
mine
did
not
last
long
he
coolly
said
he
was
worn
out
but
i
had
no
one
to
whom
i
could
make
that
excuse
and
was
compelled
to
get
along
the
best
i
could
i
was
subject
to
the
beck
and
nod
of
every
ridiculous
man
in
the
community
for
every
citizen
thought
it
his
duty
to
give
me
good
advice
if
he
did
not
give
me
patronage
and
though
i
longed
to
retaliate
by
pointing
out
the
offences
of
some
of
them
i
found
it
politic
to
hold
my
peace
occasionally
i
wrote
a
very
good
thing
at
least
occasionally
i
attracted
attention
but
nobody
gave
me
credit
for
it
and
it
was
attributed
to
some
one
in
the
town
who
could
not
write
an
ordinary
business
letter
without
lolling
out
his
tongue
a
man
should
not
write
for
a
newspaper
long
in
one
town
for
he
becomes
so
familiar
with
the
small
affairs
of
the
people
that
it
is
a
great
effort
to
treat
them
with
respect
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
he
will
have
had
occasion
to
criticise
every
man
of
any
importance
in
a
town
of
the
size
of
twin
mounds
if
he
is
honest
and
truthful
and
will
be
generally
despised
in
consequence
even
if
a
complimentary
twaddler
sowing
good
words
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
he
will
become
unpopular
for
that
for
the
people
will
soon
discover
that
he
is
a
man
of
no
discrimination
or
honesty
if
he
speaks
well
of
everybody
i
wonder
that
anyone
took
the
union
of
states
and
as
for
its
advertising
i
was
certain
the
people
were
throwing
their
money
away
it
was
the
dullest
paper
i
have
no
doubt
ever
published
but
somehow
enough
people
took
it
to
make
its
publication
profitable
though
i
was
always
expecting
them
to
stop
it
and
believed
that
it
would
in
the
end
become
necessary
to
suspend
its
publication
entirely
i
remember
that
i
would
look
over
it
carefully
on
press
days
and
thinking
that
there
was
not
a
paragraph
of
news
or
comment
which
was
not
either
old
or
silly
almost
conclude
not
to
print
it
at
all
but
if
it
was
an
hour
late
in
issuing
a
great
many
called
to
complain
which
led
me
to
believe
that
they
had
nothing
else
to
do
and
were
anxious
to
get
a
copy
and
make
fun
of
it
i
am
convinced
now
that
much
of
this
worry
if
not
all
of
it
was
unnecessary
and
that
i
need
not
have
worked
so
hard
for
when
i
went
away
i
could
not
help
noticing
that
everything
got
along
about
as
usual
and
that
nobody
missed
me
i
was
thinking
this
over
one
morning
and
wishing
i
could
get
sick
i
was
always
singularly
strong
and
robust
or
that
the
office
would
burn
down
so
that
i
could
get
a
rest
from
my
distasteful
work
when
the
light
at
the
open
door
was
completely
shut
out
and
big
adam
came
in
i
did
not
know
he
was
in
the
vicinity
and
was
surprised
to
see
him
he
seemed
in
very
good
spirits
and
sitting
down
began
looking
through
his
pockets
for
a
note
he
said
he
carried
for
me
after
he
had
found
it
and
given
it
to
me
and
while
i
was
looking
curiously
at
the
envelope
it
was
from
agnes
wondering
what
was
the
occasion
for
sending
it
in
this
unusual
fashion
big
adam
put
his
finger
in
his
mouth
drew
it
out
suddenly
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
a
sound
like
the
drawing
of
a
cork
and
then
thumping
his
jaws
slowly
while
he
extended
his
lips
apparently
poured
out
a
liberal
drink
of
liquor
the
contents
of
the
letter
were
surprising
enough
dear
ned
mother
died
early
this
morning
after
a
short
illness
i
shall
esteem
it
as
a
great
favor
if
you
will
attend
the
funeral
morning
at
ten
o
clock
your
sorrowing
friend
agnes
big
adam
seemed
to
be
very
much
offended
when
i
looked
up
from
reading
the
note
with
a
serious
face
as
he
evidently
expected
that
i
would
be
greatly
pleased
as
he
was
but
as
if
to
say
that
if
i
would
not
drink
with
him
over
his
good
fortune
he
would
drink
alone
he
pulled
another
cork
and
poured
out
the
liquor
in
very
slow
and
distinct
gurgles
i
didn
t
suspect
my
good
luck
big
adam
said
seeing
my
inquiring
look
until
agnes
woke
me
up
this
morning
and
said
the
old
missus
was
dead
and
wouldn
t
i
please
carry
the
note
to
you
i
immediately
dressed
up
in
my
best
and
started
i
think
i
never
enjoyed
a
ride
more
it
was
equal
to
an
excursion
i
hope
there
is
no
mistake
about
big
adam
was
about
to
draw
another
cork
when
i
inquired
if
deming
had
been
ill
long
about
a
week
i
should
say
and
she
kept
them
about
her
night
and
day
to
jaw
at
occasionally
sending
for
me
several
times
she
came
down
stairs
but
no
more
dried
up
than
usual
so
none
of
us
thought
anything
unusual
the
matter
she
was
always
complaining
about
something
or
other
and
although
she
was
undoubtedly
bad
off
this
time
we
didn
t
believe
it
we
thought
she
was
only
pretending
to
make
us
trouble
for
she
fooled
us
so
much
that
i
have
an
idea
they
were
all
very
much
surprised
when
they
found
her
dead
at
last
it
was
by
the
merest
accident
that
agnes
and
biggs
were
at
home
it
will
be
a
great
day
for
me
i
am
to
drive
the
remains
to
the
i
could
not
impress
big
adam
with
the
gravity
of
the
occasion
and
after
telling
him
that
i
would
go
over
to
smoky
hill
in
the
afternoon
he
went
out
into
town
but
returned
every
little
while
with
packages
of
pickles
cloves
confectionery
crackers
which
he
spread
out
on
my
table
and
devoured
with
the
greatest
relish
precisely
as
if
he
were
at
a
usually
he
was
followed
by
great
troupes
of
boys
whom
he
hired
to
swear
with
his
pickles
and
confectionery
while
he
was
out
on
the
porch
i
heard
him
say
to
one
of
them
that
he
hadn
t
an
enemy
in
the
world
but
if
he
had
he
would
like
to
hear
the
boy
curse
him
for
up
to
that
time
he
had
won
all
the
prizes
with
his
dreadful
oaths
and
was
the
raggedest
and
dirtiest
of
the
lot
he
was
arranging
for
a
fight
between
two
of
them
when
i
mildly
objected
to
it
whereupon
big
adam
laughed
with
hoarse
good
humor
and
said
that
while
he
didn
t
know
of
an
enemy
he
might
have
one
and
gave
the
wicked
boy
a
pickle
and
a
caramel
to
curse
him
or
her
as
the
case
might
be
the
young
scoundrel
promptly
responded
with
the
vilest
language
i
had
ever
heard
and
big
adam
laughed
so
loudly
that
i
thought
the
house
would
fall
down
declaring
that
the
boy
was
a
i
knew
what
he
was
about
but
he
seemed
to
be
enjoying
himself
so
much
that
i
did
not
interfere
again
at
last
he
said
he
was
certain
the
boy
s
curses
had
killed
his
enemy
and
he
called
upon
all
of
them
to
give
three
cheers
which
they
did
big
adam
joining
in
like
a
steamboat
whistle
in
the
afternoon
i
drove
over
to
the
smoky
hill
country
leaving
big
adam
to
follow
at
his
leisure
as
he
showed
a
disposition
to
dissipate
until
night
and
after
arriving
at
biggs
i
put
the
horses
away
in
the
stable
i
had
become
familiar
with
on
my
first
visit
to
the
place
the
stalls
of
which
were
still
oozy
and
wet
and
went
up
to
the
house
although
i
disliked
to
disturb
the
quiet
of
the
place
i
was
compelled
to
ring
the
bell
for
there
was
no
other
way
of
attracting
attention
and
after
a
little
while
agnes
came
to
open
the
door
instead
of
speaking
to
me
she
burst
out
crying
and
in
involuntary
pity
for
her
distress
i
took
her
in
my
arms
to
which
she
made
no
resistance
but
sobbed
softly
as
i
tried
to
comfort
her
with
pitying
words
i
did
not
even
think
of
my
arms
being
about
her
or
that
her
head
rested
on
my
shoulder
and
for
the
first
time
in
several
years
i
felt
natural
in
her
presence
from
where
we
stood
in
the
hall
i
could
see
through
an
open
door
a
plain
coffin
supported
at
each
end
with
a
chair
in
the
room
where
i
had
sat
with
biggs
on
my
first
visit
to
the
house
i
was
impressed
that
it
held
a
friendless
body
for
the
coffin
was
not
ornamented
in
any
way
and
had
evidently
been
hurriedly
made
by
a
country
carpenter
the
top
was
shut
down
as
though
there
were
no
friends
anxious
to
look
frequently
at
the
face
and
for
the
first
time
i
felt
sympathy
for
the
dead
it
was
no
doubt
very
absurd
in
me
but
i
had
almost
expected
to
find
the
family
in
good
spirits
on
my
arrival
for
i
had
never
had
a
kindly
thought
for
deming
in
my
life
her
brother
never
mentioned
her
at
all
her
only
child
did
not
except
when
it
was
necessary
and
big
adam
had
told
me
so
much
of
her
disagreeable
qualities
that
i
was
very
much
prejudiced
against
her
but
when
i
found
that
no
one
but
members
of
her
own
family
were
there
during
her
sickness
and
death
i
felt
kindly
toward
her
memory
and
thought
that
big
adam
had
certainly
misrepresented
her
the
distress
of
agnes
which
continued
after
we
were
seated
in
the
room
where
the
coffin
was
also
convinced
me
there
must
have
been
some
good
in
the
dead
woman
and
as
the
room
began
to
grow
dark
from
the
going
down
of
the
sun
i
thought
that
her
life
had
been
a
night
which
i
hoped
would
be
followed
by
a
glorious
morning
i
heard
while
at
the
house
it
may
have
been
from
her
old
enemy
who
returned
from
town
in
the
course
of
the
night
whistling
all
the
wild
airs
i
had
ever
heard
that
the
family
had
not
a
single
acquaintance
in
the
neighborhood
and
that
no
one
came
to
the
house
except
a
farmer
occasionally
to
see
biggs
on
business
that
the
people
all
believed
deming
to
be
a
witch
and
that
they
kept
and
charms
in
their
houses
from
dread
of
her
although
many
of
them
knew
and
admired
pretty
agnes
they
believed
she
had
been
stolen
by
deming
when
very
young
and
were
always
expecting
some
one
to
arrive
and
claim
her
from
an
occasional
noise
overhead
i
understood
that
biggs
and
the
family
were
up
stairs
but
none
of
them
appearing
i
volunteered
to
remain
up
during
the
night
to
watch
agnes
gratefully
accepted
the
offer
and
as
i
sat
there
trying
to
read
after
her
disappearance
i
could
tell
when
each
one
of
the
eight
children
was
put
to
bed
at
last
i
heard
the
cradle
which
had
been
going
constantly
up
to
that
time
stop
and
i
knew
the
baby
the
last
one
had
been
disposed
of
therefore
i
was
not
surprised
that
soon
after
biggs
came
softly
into
the
room
quite
elegantly
dressed
in
slippers
and
gown
though
he
seemed
very
much
depressed
he
bowed
to
me
patronizingly
as
much
as
to
say
that
few
men
could
look
as
interesting
in
grief
as
he
did
and
after
standing
before
me
a
moment
to
consider
the
matter
took
hold
of
my
hand
and
shook
it
sideways
though
i
was
accustomed
to
shake
up
and
down
as
he
walked
around
the
room
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
i
wondered
whether
i
should
be
compelled
to
take
the
accustomed
dose
of
philosophy
and
i
soon
saw
that
i
should
for
as
he
walked
he
meditated
this
was
his
usual
way
before
attacking
me
coming
over
to
me
presently
in
a
manner
indicating
that
he
had
long
been
waiting
for
opportunity
to
discourse
on
the
shortness
of
life
and
the
presence
of
the
coffin
afforded
it
he
seated
himself
and
abruptly
inquired
what
is
life
i
knew
i
was
not
expected
to
reply
therefore
i
did
not
give
him
my
views
on
the
somewhat
complex
question
and
he
soon
went
on
taking
a
man
for
example
when
it
is
first
known
that
he
is
to
have
an
existence
his
mother
cries
and
his
father
says
he
wouldn
t
have
had
it
happen
for
the
world
or
for
fifty
thousand
dollars
although
he
may
not
have
a
dollar
he
can
truthfully
call
his
own
after
a
season
of
piling
his
clothes
all
in
one
place
at
night
on
the
part
of
the
coming
man
s
father
and
grief
and
suffering
on
the
part
of
his
mother
he
is
finally
born
and
the
women
of
the
neighborhood
come
in
to
see
which
one
of
his
parents
he
resembles
although
it
should
be
known
beforehand
that
he
will
be
like
the
uglier
one
in
face
and
disposition
this
may
always
be
depended
upon
it
never
fails
when
he
is
a
month
old
or
on
the
first
regular
after
his
birth
his
father
quarrels
with
the
doctor
for
bringing
him
into
the
world
at
all
and
pays
the
price
in
great
anger
and
under
protest
vowing
that
he
will
never
again
give
the
old
quack
opportunity
to
rob
him
when
he
is
three
or
four
months
old
his
father
and
mother
quarrel
as
to
whether
he
shall
be
named
for
her
people
or
his
folks
this
settled
he
is
attacked
with
colic
followed
in
rapid
succession
by
the
numerous
distressing
complaints
which
nobody
ever
escaped
after
this
comes
his
boyhood
which
he
always
remembers
as
being
particularly
disagreeable
as
he
never
gets
enough
to
eat
and
is
constantly
being
found
fault
with
and
whipped
at
last
he
is
started
to
school
where
a
man
who
is
a
tyrant
because
he
is
not
a
lawyer
or
a
woman
who
is
cross
because
she
is
not
married
endures
him
during
the
hours
of
the
day
when
the
outside
is
most
attractive
from
this
he
runs
away
and
serves
an
apprenticeship
with
the
world
making
so
many
mistakes
and
doing
so
many
foolish
things
that
he
is
crestfallen
the
remainder
of
his
life
then
he
marries
the
wrong
woman
and
has
the
experience
of
his
father
over
again
meanwhile
working
like
a
slave
to
get
something
ahead
but
he
does
not
succeed
as
he
has
a
faculty
of
doing
that
which
he
ought
not
to
do
although
he
strives
very
earnestly
to
become
a
great
man
and
make
his
father
ashamed
of
himself
and
after
a
life
of
misery
a
boy
comes
out
of
his
front
door
on
a
morning
after
a
stormy
and
windy
night
and
hangs
crape
on
the
knob
if
there
is
a
newspaper
in
the
town
where
he
lives
he
is
given
a
magnificent
column
to
induce
the
relatives
to
buy
large
numbers
of
extra
copies
to
send
away
the
next
day
a
hearse
and
six
gentlemen
in
black
clothes
and
white
cotton
gloves
appear
at
his
front
gate
the
neighbors
come
straggling
in
to
see
what
the
mourners
will
do
and
an
hour
after
that
a
surly
sexton
who
is
wondering
who
will
pay
him
begins
to
rattle
clods
on
his
coffin
whereupon
the
carriages
on
the
outer
edge
begin
to
drive
hurriedly
away
as
if
too
much
time
had
been
spent
with
him
already
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
is
an
inhabitant
of
the
silent
city
whose
residents
quietly
wait
to
be
gathered
as
brands
for
the
burning
if
he
happened
to
be
possessed
of
an
extra
farm
or
a
store
or
ready
money
his
afflicted
relatives
prove
that
he
had
been
crazy
several
years
before
his
death
that
they
may
divide
his
effects
to
suit
themselves
and
which
they
afterwards
spend
in
ribald
and
riotous
living
the
principal
merit
of
this
brief
sketch
as
the
newspaper
writers
say
is
its
entire
truthfulness
deceased
he
inclined
his
head
towards
the
coffin
had
an
experience
like
that
i
have
mentioned
except
that
she
was
a
woman
peace
to
her
he
spoke
of
his
sister
as
deceased
as
though
that
had
been
her
name
instead
of
maggie
or
jennie
or
whatever
it
really
was
now
that
she
is
up
there
biggs
continued
after
a
short
silence
waving
his
right
hand
toward
the
ceiling
i
do
not
care
if
i
mention
that
deceased
had
an
unhappy
disposition
she
had
that
tendency
when
a
very
little
girl
being
an
angel
now
she
will
recognize
what
i
am
saying
as
the
truth
and
commend
me
for
it
and
was
usually
disagreeable
to
those
around
her
whether
her
complaint
was
poor
health
or
disappointed
hopes
i
do
not
know
but
as
a
man
who
believes
that
it
is
best
to
tell
the
truth
at
all
hazards
i
confess
to
you
she
died
friendless
if
there
is
not
secret
joy
in
this
house
that
she
is
dead
then
my
philosophy
avails
me
nothing
and
i
am
as
a
ship
on
an
unknown
sea
without
rudder
or
the
expression
of
a
ship
without
rudder
or
compass
seemed
to
please
him
for
he
repeated
it
quite
eloquently
speaking
of
ships
reminds
me
of
my
late
whom
i
have
never
seen
when
he
promised
to
marry
the
clay
which
reposes
in
yon
coffin
i
was
away
from
home
the
exact
facts
are
that
i
was
chased
away
by
my
father
a
quiet
and
honest
worker
in
wood
who
objected
to
my
noise
and
lying
but
for
a
reason
which
seems
to
actuate
all
fools
i
wrote
home
that
i
should
never
be
entirely
content
until
i
had
murdered
the
man
who
had
bewitched
my
sister
i
can
t
tell
at
this
time
what
caused
me
to
do
it
unless
it
was
knowledge
of
a
custom
that
whenever
a
girl
marries
her
brothers
and
father
make
fools
of
themselves
and
at
that
time
i
was
not
above
custom
for
captain
deming
was
a
very
worthy
young
man
i
think
he
was
greatly
disgusted
at
the
absurd
manner
in
which
we
carried
on
and
if
his
spirit
has
been
released
from
the
deep
and
is
hovering
around
this
place
i
desire
that
he
hear
my
declaration
that
i
am
ashamed
of
the
little
man
was
dramatic
again
and
waved
his
hands
downward
to
represent
the
deep
and
upward
to
represent
the
heavens
none
of
us
liked
the
girl
he
surprised
me
by
confessing
and
i
think
that
there
was
some
dissatisfaction
that
she
did
not
marry
and
rid
my
father
of
her
keeping
but
the
moment
there
was
a
prospect
she
would
marry
we
all
began
to
object
though
i
can
not
imagine
why
at
that
time
i
was
working
in
a
stable
in
a
town
in
the
west
and
i
wrote
to
captain
deming
that
only
pressing
business
engagements
prevented
my
coming
on
and
snatching
the
girl
from
his
relentless
clutches
advising
my
father
at
the
same
time
by
letter
not
to
scruple
to
burn
shoot
or
stab
to
save
the
family
from
impending
disgrace
i
believe
he
did
sharpen
up
his
hatchet
and
saw
with
a
vague
idea
of
sawing
the
deming
body
in
two
and
then
cutting
it
to
pieces
i
am
also
informed
that
he
said
in
the
hearing
of
the
captain
one
evening
that
he
would
rather
see
the
girl
in
her
grave
and
when
the
ceremony
was
finally
performed
he
made
himself
still
further
ridiculous
by
remarking
to
my
mother
in
the
presence
of
the
guests
that
it
was
all
her
he
was
apparently
greatly
amused
by
the
recollection
of
this
ridiculous
circumstance
and
stopped
to
laugh
to
himself
although
i
thought
it
was
only
an
expression
of
satisfaction
that
he
was
finally
rid
of
deming
perhaps
he
had
been
wanting
to
laugh
all
day
and
was
now
telling
me
jokes
as
an
excuse
i
made
a
great
spectacle
of
myself
in
the
town
where
i
lived
by
going
about
in
a
dejected
and
wretched
condition
and
saying
that
the
princess
my
sister
had
married
a
low
fellow
who
followed
the
sea
and
a
few
months
after
that
when
i
was
anxious
to
boast
of
captain
deming
my
i
was
compelled
to
move
to
another
place
as
the
two
stories
would
not
fit
in
the
same
town
for
this
reason
i
went
further
west
and
finally
turned
up
in
the
smoky
hills
i
believe
i
never
told
you
before
how
i
happened
to
come
had
the
little
old
woman
burst
off
the
lid
and
sat
up
in
the
coffin
to
protest
i
could
not
have
been
more
surprised
than
i
was
captain
deming
turned
out
to
be
a
very
superior
man
biggs
continued
reflectively
and
deceased
to
be
a
very
inferior
woman
judging
from
the
evidence
now
at
hand
but
for
several
years
there
was
a
tradition
in
my
family
that
she
had
thrown
herself
my
companion
seemed
to
enjoy
telling
the
truth
about
himself
as
much
as
i
had
already
noticed
he
delighted
in
telling
it
of
others
and
while
wondering
what
family
confidence
he
would
next
let
me
into
he
said
although
in
my
youth
i
had
a
great
deal
to
say
about
the
surprising
respectability
of
my
family
they
were
really
a
very
unpromising
crowd
while
none
of
them
ever
walked
between
the
minister
and
the
sheriff
to
a
hanging
or
was
ever
locked
up
for
theft
none
of
them
amounted
to
anything
and
i
am
glad
that
they
are
all
in
ignorance
as
to
where
i
am
for
i
never
want
to
see
any
of
them
again
i
am
bad
enough
but
they
are
worse
my
favorite
uncle
the
duke
was
a
barber
in
the
town
where
i
was
raised
his
sister
the
duchess
was
a
disagreeable
old
maid
who
existed
entirely
on
her
respectability
for
she
spent
her
time
in
visiting
those
of
her
relatives
who
had
houses
and
in
boasting
of
it
she
was
the
laziest
woman
i
ever
knew
in
my
life
by
the
way
my
grandfather
the
count
was
a
market
gardener
and
there
was
an
earl
on
my
mother
s
side
who
was
a
fireman
and
the
heir
to
all
his
possessions
rode
horses
at
races
because
he
was
old
and
little
the
others
i
have
forgotten
and
i
am
sincerely
grateful
to
my
memory
for
the
it
was
very
late
and
as
i
did
not
relish
the
thought
of
remaining
alone
in
the
room
with
the
coffin
i
was
sincerely
obliged
to
my
companion
for
his
company
and
was
pleased
when
i
saw
that
he
had
more
to
say
naturally
i
am
a
great
i
tried
to
look
astonished
as
he
intended
i
should
but
i
am
afraid
i
did
not
i
did
not
know
until
a
few
years
ago
that
honesty
was
the
best
policy
and
as
a
boy
and
young
man
i
never
told
the
truth
even
when
it
would
do
as
well
as
a
falsehood
but
of
late
years
i
deal
in
nothing
but
facts
truths
and
principles
i
go
even
farther
than
that
i
rake
up
the
past
to
find
truths
that
might
be
kept
secret
for
i
now
enjoy
honesty
as
i
formerly
enjoyed
dishonesty
the
world
is
full
of
men
like
me
in
the
particular
that
they
tell
the
truth
for
no
other
reason
than
that
experience
has
taught
them
it
is
best
to
do
it
i
know
hundreds
of
men
naturally
thieves
who
are
scrupulously
honest
for
the
same
reason
and
there
is
a
great
deal
in
the
saying
that
honesty
is
the
best
policy
it
cost
me
several
years
of
disagreeable
experience
to
make
the
discovery
but
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
honesty
is
the
best
i
had
never
heard
any
one
accuse
biggs
of
having
reformed
except
biggs
himself
for
it
was
generally
understood
that
he
was
thoroughly
unscrupulous
in
everything
and
the
people
would
no
more
trust
him
for
money
than
they
would
take
his
word
if
i
lived
on
a
lonely
island
without
a
neighbor
i
would
do
right
in
everything
for
the
reason
that
even
under
such
circumstances
honesty
would
be
the
best
policy
it
pays
better
to
be
honest
to
yourself
in
fact
than
to
your
neighbor
it
s
a
pity
these
facts
are
not
more
generally
known
and
accepted
for
we
should
then
have
a
very
different
world
i
am
ashamed
of
it
as
it
he
walked
out
of
the
room
soon
after
and
left
me
alone
where
i
remained
in
great
terror
until
an
hour
or
two
after
midnight
when
fortunately
i
went
to
sleep
in
my
chair
and
did
not
awaken
until
agnes
came
down
in
the
morning
the
funeral
was
without
incident
except
that
very
much
to
the
surprise
of
everybody
damon
barker
appeared
soon
after
the
procession
started
and
walked
reverently
behind
the
wagon
in
which
biggs
agnes
and
myself
rode
big
adam
driving
ahead
with
the
coffin
biggs
and
the
children
remained
at
the
house
for
some
reason
and
i
did
not
see
any
of
them
during
my
visit
a
few
neighbors
appeared
at
the
grave
and
threw
in
the
dirt
after
the
body
had
been
lowered
as
i
believe
they
had
thrown
it
out
but
none
of
them
came
to
the
house
there
was
no
funeral
service
but
as
soon
as
we
arrived
at
the
place
selected
for
the
burial
the
coffin
was
put
down
and
covered
up
after
which
we
returned
to
the
house
and
threw
open
the
shutters
although
barker
was
invited
to
return
with
us
he
politely
refused
and
went
directly
home
from
the
church
which
was
located
within
a
few
rods
of
the
place
where
biggs
had
opened
the
store
and
where
the
was
still
kept
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
it
was
arranged
that
agnes
should
return
home
with
me
and
live
there
in
future
as
my
mother
had
long
been
anxious
to
have
her
do
and
during
the
drive
to
twin
mounds
little
was
said
for
neither
was
in
the
mood
for
talking
i
can
only
remember
of
that
afternoon
that
when
we
arrived
at
home
my
mother
was
waiting
and
that
for
the
first
time
some
one
seemed
considerate
of
agnes
for
my
mother
caressed
her
tenderly
and
led
her
weeping
into
the
house
chapter
xxiv
a
letter
from
jo
my
dear
old
friend
i
am
much
alarmed
when
i
realize
that
i
am
becoming
a
thinking
man
like
your
father
and
that
my
trouble
will
some
time
become
so
great
that
i
shall
disgrace
myself
and
everyone
connected
with
me
since
you
were
here
last
i
have
done
little
else
than
think
and
i
have
been
very
lonely
for
i
have
no
companion
now
i
have
not
spoken
to
mateel
since
you
went
away
except
when
it
was
necessary
and
that
has
not
been
a
frequent
circumstance
this
adds
to
my
wretchedness
for
i
feel
contemptible
that
i
am
not
able
to
be
to
all
appearance
what
i
always
was
i
have
tried
to
be
but
to
no
purpose
so
i
have
given
it
up
i
can
not
say
that
i
wish
i
could
forget
for
then
i
should
feel
that
i
was
the
man
she
described
in
the
letter
i
am
a
shrinking
dejected
coward
which
i
never
was
before
and
i
think
it
is
because
i
am
not
treating
mateel
as
i
should
though
i
solemnly
assert
that
i
can
not
do
differently
a
man
who
mistreats
a
woman
becomes
a
coward
as
i
am
and
i
accept
the
ignominy
as
my
punishment
i
was
bold
as
a
lion
when
we
were
happy
together
and
could
look
any
man
in
the
face
but
i
can
not
now
for
i
think
that
everyone
who
looks
at
me
is
an
accuser
that
i
am
worrying
and
fretting
a
helpless
woman
which
i
believe
to
be
the
meanest
crime
of
which
a
man
can
be
guilty
i
can
not
but
acknowledge
the
accusation
though
it
is
not
intentional
i
am
low
and
despicable
in
spite
of
all
i
can
do
and
i
can
think
of
no
remedy
for
it
i
continue
to
make
new
discoveries
which
add
to
my
wretchedness
a
long
while
before
we
were
married
mateel
gave
me
a
book
full
of
pretty
love
stories
and
i
valued
it
highly
because
many
of
the
passages
were
underscored
with
notes
on
the
margin
indorsing
the
sentiment
the
stories
were
very
pretty
and
i
read
them
a
great
deal
but
i
have
discovered
that
the
book
was
originally
given
to
bragg
that
it
was
returned
when
he
tired
of
her
and
that
the
pretty
passages
were
marked
for
him
it
was
given
to
me
no
doubt
because
it
happened
to
be
convenient
and
no
one
else
wanted
it
mateel
with
the
candor
which
i
have
come
to
dread
admitted
it
though
reluctantly
on
being
questioned
one
of
the
romances
to
which
i
refer
tells
of
a
lady
who
had
quarrelled
with
her
lover
and
in
a
pique
married
a
cold
heartless
man
who
had
no
other
good
quality
than
that
he
was
kind
and
successful
and
the
story
is
her
reverie
after
seven
or
eight
years
she
accidentally
meets
her
old
lover
and
confesses
that
she
loves
him
yet
and
has
loved
him
all
the
while
though
she
is
kind
enough
to
refer
to
her
husband
as
a
dear
good
soul
this
was
particularly
full
of
pencil
marks
as
though
it
aptly
stated
her
case
and
i
think
that
after
she
knew
a
separation
with
bragg
was
imminent
she
was
anxious
to
let
him
know
that
her
future
would
be
something
like
that
another
one
tells
of
an
eccentric
bachelor
who
meets
a
pale
but
strikingly
beautiful
girl
on
the
street
on
a
cold
winter
s
night
he
once
loved
a
face
like
that
and
interested
himself
in
the
girl
in
course
of
time
it
developed
that
the
bachelor
had
been
engaged
to
the
girl
s
mother
and
that
they
were
separated
by
some
sort
of
an
unfortunate
mistake
and
she
married
a
man
who
was
willing
to
support
her
in
her
grief
but
who
unfortunately
died
and
could
no
longer
feed
her
while
she
mourned
humiliated
and
broken
she
refused
to
return
to
her
old
friends
but
lived
with
her
only
daughter
in
poverty
talking
a
great
deal
of
her
lover
but
not
a
word
of
the
poor
fellow
who
had
been
her
husband
when
she
finds
death
approaching
she
writes
a
letter
to
her
lover
consigning
the
girl
to
his
care
and
the
letter
of
course
falls
into
his
hands
which
affects
him
so
much
that
he
surprised
his
friends
by
marrying
the
daughter
i
suppose
the
inference
is
that
mateel
acknowledging
her
own
weakness
desired
bragg
to
understand
that
she
would
only
consent
to
marry
another
man
with
the
hope
of
rearing
a
daughter
good
enough
for
him
there
have
been
a
few
sweet
chords
of
music
in
my
life
a
very
very
few
and
simple
in
construction
but
while
never
complete
in
my
boyhood
i
have
listened
to
them
in
my
lonely
hours
with
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
they
were
the
whisperings
of
hope
of
happiness
which
i
had
never
known
but
now
the
familiar
air
scarcely
begins
until
it
is
lost
in
the
yells
of
demons
and
the
harsh
laughter
of
devils
i
do
not
know
whether
i
read
it
or
dreamed
it
but
there
was
once
a
deep
cave
said
to
be
haunted
the
people
who
went
there
without
lights
and
did
not
speak
for
a
long
while
heard
the
beginning
of
the
most
delicious
symphony
as
sweet
and
perfect
as
the
music
of
the
choirs
in
heaven
but
suddenly
it
was
all
lost
in
coarse
uproar
and
laughter
as
if
the
devil
and
his
imps
were
flushed
with
wine
at
a
banquet
and
were
telling
each
other
of
the
follies
of
men
to
laugh
at
them
this
dreadful
tumult
continued
until
the
music
was
quite
forgotten
and
no
one
could
remember
the
strain
although
they
all
said
it
was
very
tender
and
beautiful
sometimes
the
people
who
went
there
would
hear
neither
the
music
nor
the
tumult
which
always
broke
into
it
but
this
always
happened
when
the
night
was
fine
and
the
visitors
noisy
and
in
good
spirits
but
every
dark
and
threatening
night
when
the
wind
came
hurrying
down
from
the
north
to
be
present
at
the
destruction
threatened
those
who
went
into
the
cave
always
heard
the
music
and
it
was
notably
tender
and
touching
on
such
occasions
but
the
devils
broke
into
it
more
quickly
and
were
hoarser
and
louder
in
their
laughing
and
jeering
everything
conspires
against
me
now
even
mateel
s
religion
torments
me
i
can
think
of
nothing
that
can
not
in
some
way
be
construed
into
misery
mateel
s
hope
of
heaven
is
a
hope
of
torment
for
me
she
knows
my
unbelief
and
must
be
convinced
that
if
she
is
right
the
years
of
her
happiness
in
the
future
can
only
be
measured
by
the
years
of
my
suffering
but
she
has
no
other
comfort
to
offer
than
the
hope
that
i
shall
be
how
natural
it
is
to
disguise
fear
with
hope
i
would
not
regard
it
as
a
kindness
in
a
man
who
saw
me
drowning
to
stand
peacefully
on
the
bank
and
hope
i
would
take
hold
of
a
straw
and
save
myself
but
i
should
admire
him
if
he
jumped
in
and
pulled
me
out
hope
is
often
nothing
more
than
an
excuse
for
incapacity
and
for
mistakes
as
we
hope
in
case
of
an
accident
caused
by
carelessness
that
nothing
serious
will
result
or
as
we
hope
when
we
do
not
do
our
duty
that
everything
will
turn
out
fortunately
anyway
if
my
love
for
mateel
had
never
been
interrupted
and
i
had
her
faith
and
she
my
doubts
i
should
go
mad
from
thinking
of
her
future
i
would
make
my
interest
in
her
impending
fate
so
great
that
she
would
become
alarmed
and
be
rescued
or
failing
in
that
i
would
be
lost
with
her
i
would
not
own
a
faith
which
would
not
save
one
i
loved
and
whom
i
knew
to
be
honest
and
i
have
no
particular
fears
for
myself
but
knowing
mateel
s
belief
as
i
do
i
am
hurt
at
her
indifference
i
am
always
thinking
really
i
can
not
help
it
much
as
i
try
that
she
offers
up
her
prayers
for
bragg
and
that
to
be
reunited
with
him
i
must
be
burned
up
for
i
am
certain
that
i
could
not
exist
with
him
comfortably
anywhere
i
take
a
kind
of
delight
in
finding
out
how
unfortunate
i
am
and
once
i
wrung
a
confession
from
her
that
she
thought
it
extremely
probable
that
i
would
be
lost
but
that
all
knowledge
of
it
would
be
blotted
out
of
her
memory
and
forget
in
her
happiness
that
i
had
ever
lived
if
mateel
s
religion
turns
out
to
be
true
i
think
it
will
be
a
part
of
my
punishment
to
be
permitted
to
look
into
heaven
and
see
her
happy
without
a
care
or
thought
of
me
i
don
t
think
it
would
be
possible
to
save
such
a
man
but
it
may
become
necessary
to
properly
punish
my
wickedness
to
place
bragg
by
her
side
in
paradise
that
i
may
contemplate
them
walking
lovingly
together
the
skeleton
which
has
found
its
way
into
my
closet
is
very
noisy
now
i
think
some
one
out
of
consideration
for
me
has
been
trying
to
chain
him
up
but
he
has
broken
loose
and
drags
his
fetters
about
in
the
most
dismal
manner
either
that
or
he
has
company
and
i
am
honored
with
two
skeletons
if
other
people
have
but
one
i
think
i
shall
eventually
have
two
if
i
have
not
now
and
be
compelled
to
enlarge
my
closet
i
have
occasionally
courageously
unlocked
my
skeleton
and
tried
to
look
him
out
of
countenance
but
he
is
so
indifferent
and
i
am
so
unhappy
that
i
have
never
succeeded
he
is
the
most
impudent
skeleton
that
ever
took
up
an
abode
in
a
man
s
house
against
his
will
and
its
grinning
malicious
face
i
can
not
lock
up
for
it
follows
me
about
the
mill
at
my
work
and
walks
before
me
into
the
dark
cellar
and
into
the
lonely
loft
once
i
thought
i
saw
his
tracks
in
the
flour
dust
but
i
found
it
was
only
where
my
unmanly
tears
had
fallen
after
i
have
attacked
him
he
is
more
noisy
than
ever
at
night
and
rattles
about
so
much
that
i
acknowledge
his
power
by
thinking
my
disgrace
all
over
and
admitting
that
there
is
no
hope
the
affairs
of
men
are
so
small
that
i
wonder
they
can
be
serious
about
them
i
wonder
about
this
every
time
i
meet
a
grave
and
thoughtful
man
and
then
i
remember
that
i
am
grave
and
thoughtful
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
i
were
told
of
a
case
similar
to
my
own
i
should
say
the
man
ought
to
dismiss
it
without
a
curse
and
never
think
of
it
again
but
somehow
i
can
not
do
it
though
i
have
tried
earnestly
and
honestly
i
had
so
little
peace
and
content
as
a
boy
and
expected
so
much
from
my
marriage
that
i
can
not
resign
myself
to
a
life
without
hope
and
without
happiness
i
suppose
the
people
would
laugh
at
my
troubles
if
they
knew
them
and
i
call
their
affairs
trivial
so
that
altogether
we
have
a
very
contemptuous
opinion
of
each
other
many
of
those
who
come
to
the
mill
look
at
me
curiously
already
and
i
suppose
it
is
being
said
that
i
am
queer
or
that
i
am
subject
to
fits
of
despondency
which
is
the
first
symptom
of
a
crazy
man
next
to
the
original
difficulty
i
dread
most
to
be
called
queer
for
i
never
heard
it
said
of
a
man
i
respected
but
this
will
probably
be
added
to
my
other
troubles
for
when
once
a
man
becomes
involved
in
trouble
s
web
everything
goes
against
him
i
am
only
unhappy
because
i
expected
the
home
i
built
with
so
much
care
to
be
pleasant
but
it
is
not
i
expected
no
more
than
this
and
i
would
have
been
a
willing
slave
to
insure
that
result
but
there
is
not
the
slightest
prospect
of
it
now
jo
erring
chapter
xxv
the
sea
gives
up
its
dead
my
mother
was
never
strong
and
her
health
seemed
to
be
rapidly
failing
but
she
was
perceptibly
revived
by
the
presence
of
agnes
when
i
told
her
that
agnes
would
now
live
there
all
the
time
and
never
go
away
again
she
expressed
great
pleasure
and
for
days
was
not
content
to
be
out
of
her
company
but
followed
her
slowly
around
the
house
as
she
went
about
her
work
we
were
like
three
children
again
suddenly
released
from
restraint
but
when
we
spoke
in
the
evening
of
the
happy
years
we
should
spend
together
my
mother
became
thoughtful
at
once
and
would
say
no
more
that
night
her
step
was
slower
than
it
had
ever
been
and
she
walked
more
feebly
but
she
still
kept
up
the
lonely
vigils
in
her
own
room
at
night
and
the
light
was
always
burning
casting
its
rays
across
the
deserted
street
like
a
pitying
star
if
i
became
restless
in
my
bed
from
thinking
of
her
pale
face
and
went
softly
down
the
stairs
to
her
door
i
found
her
quietly
seated
in
the
low
chair
as
if
waiting
for
a
step
in
the
street
and
a
hand
on
the
door
she
no
longer
came
to
my
room
at
night
as
she
had
done
when
we
were
alone
but
she
apologized
for
it
once
because
of
growing
weakness
and
believing
that
she
dreaded
to
be
alone
i
sometimes
lay
down
on
her
bed
and
slept
there
but
if
i
awoke
in
the
night
i
found
her
in
the
old
corner
with
her
head
bowed
low
and
wrapped
in
deep
meditation
the
coming
of
agnes
brightened
the
lonely
house
which
had
always
been
cold
and
cheerless
as
if
it
were
very
old
and
were
inhabited
only
by
very
old
people
and
i
was
more
content
than
i
had
been
until
i
remembered
that
my
mother
was
slowly
dying
of
a
broken
heart
this
thought
came
to
me
whenever
we
were
spending
the
evening
pleasantly
together
and
often
i
went
away
to
hide
my
tears
when
i
talked
to
agnes
about
it
which
i
often
did
before
and
after
she
came
there
to
live
i
saw
by
her
troubled
face
that
she
shared
my
fears
and
that
she
too
had
marked
the
faltering
steps
and
whitening
hairs
though
we
resolved
over
and
over
again
to
do
more
for
her
comfort
and
happiness
and
be
more
watchful
of
her
she
was
always
just
the
same
silent
and
sorrowful
with
a
look
in
her
white
face
of
worry
and
sorrow
whenever
she
opened
a
door
or
looked
into
a
box
or
drawer
she
seemed
to
find
something
to
remind
her
of
her
husband
an
article
of
wearing
apparel
a
scrap
of
paper
on
which
he
had
written
and
this
she
kept
in
her
hand
and
carried
about
holding
it
until
she
took
her
place
in
the
low
chair
for
the
night
where
it
remained
the
subject
of
her
thoughts
we
both
called
her
mother
and
though
we
were
anxious
that
she
should
commend
us
she
seemed
shy
as
if
she
were
in
the
way
and
agnes
told
me
that
once
when
she
put
her
hand
lovingly
on
her
head
and
said
we
were
good
children
she
did
it
timidly
fearful
of
giving
offence
she
still
slept
a
little
during
the
day
or
at
least
she
would
darken
her
room
when
no
one
was
around
and
lie
down
but
we
never
found
her
asleep
at
night
and
believed
that
she
never
left
her
chair
it
may
have
been
two
months
after
agnes
came
there
to
live
when
we
were
sitting
together
one
evening
and
agnes
was
telling
us
again
of
her
father
of
which
she
never
tired
and
i
recollect
that
i
made
more
inquiries
about
him
than
i
had
ever
done
because
my
mother
was
much
interested
in
my
statement
that
men
sometimes
came
back
after
an
absence
of
a
great
many
years
and
told
strange
stories
of
adventure
i
had
no
idea
this
was
true
of
captain
deming
of
whose
death
there
had
never
been
any
question
but
my
mother
was
listening
closely
and
i
recalled
several
instances
of
the
return
of
those
given
up
for
dead
what
evidence
have
you
i
asked
that
your
father
is
dead
other
than
that
he
never
came
back
evidently
agnes
had
no
thought
of
a
possibility
that
he
was
alive
for
though
she
immediately
became
grave
and
thoughtful
there
was
no
expression
of
hope
in
her
earnest
face
after
thinking
about
it
a
long
while
she
confessed
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
his
death
except
that
he
had
never
been
heard
from
which
was
the
brief
story
of
hundreds
who
had
been
drowned
at
sea
there
was
one
part
of
the
story
which
i
had
never
before
heard
though
probably
it
was
not
important
the
crew
which
her
father
had
shipped
at
bradford
was
discharged
on
reaching
the
first
port
the
captain
claiming
there
were
evidences
of
mutiny
among
them
though
when
they
returned
they
declared
that
never
were
men
more
faithful
and
honest
since
that
time
neither
the
ship
nor
its
captain
had
ever
been
heard
of
and
the
returning
sailors
believed
it
had
gone
down
because
of
the
shipping
of
an
incompetent
crew
agnes
did
not
know
nor
could
the
sailors
who
came
back
to
bradford
tell
her
what
port
the
vessel
loaded
for
when
they
were
discharged
and
this
seemed
so
strange
to
me
that
i
determined
to
insert
an
advertisement
in
a
paper
published
in
a
sea
town
and
solicit
information
from
the
captains
of
that
day
this
would
require
a
long
time
so
i
resolved
to
say
nothing
of
my
intention
though
i
had
little
hope
anything
would
come
of
it
i
found
that
agnes
knew
little
about
the
matter
as
she
was
very
young
when
her
father
sailed
away
never
to
return
but
her
mother
she
said
had
made
investigations
which
left
no
doubt
of
the
shipwreck
and
death
my
mother
and
agnes
were
sitting
together
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
while
i
was
facing
the
door
which
led
into
the
hall
and
into
the
street
i
remember
these
details
distinctly
because
the
ghostly
turn
the
talk
had
taken
led
me
to
think
that
if
the
sea
should
give
up
its
dead
and
the
captain
of
the
agnes
walk
in
dripping
with
wet
i
should
be
nearest
the
door
by
which
he
would
enter
agnes
was
sitting
with
my
mother
who
was
quietly
stroking
her
hair
and
as
i
looked
at
them
i
wondered
if
there
were
two
wanderers
out
in
the
world
wearily
travelling
toward
them
or
whether
those
for
whom
they
mourned
were
dead
and
would
never
be
heard
from
it
was
the
merest
fancy
for
i
have
since
tried
to
remember
whether
i
believed
that
night
that
captain
deming
was
alive
or
that
my
father
would
ever
return
and
i
have
decided
that
i
had
no
real
belief
in
such
a
possibility
they
were
both
deeply
interested
in
what
i
was
saying
though
incredulous
and
i
must
have
been
amusing
myself
in
seeing
how
much
i
could
move
them
though
i
had
no
intention
of
being
cruel
perhaps
i
thought
hope
was
pleasant
even
if
it
had
no
foundation
for
i
kept
on
in
such
a
way
that
both
became
very
much
excited
the
wind
was
rising
outside
and
when
it
rattled
at
the
doors
and
windows
i
thought
it
sounded
as
if
some
one
was
demanding
admittance
it
wouldn
t
surprise
me
i
said
gravely
after
a
long
silence
as
if
i
had
been
debating
the
question
for
several
years
though
i
had
never
thought
of
it
before
if
your
father
should
come
to
this
house
some
night
i
think
it
would
be
a
dark
and
stormy
night
for
they
say
those
long
absent
only
return
at
such
times
and
sitting
among
us
tell
strange
stories
of
his
wanderings
and
of
his
search
for
you
the
two
travellers
we
seem
to
be
always
expecting
here
may
meet
on
the
road
as
they
near
the
town
and
come
on
together
perhaps
it
is
not
likely
but
it
is
they
were
both
looking
strangely
at
each
other
and
then
at
me
and
then
timidly
at
the
door
leading
into
the
hall
and
out
into
the
street
if
they
should
return
they
could
easily
step
into
the
hall
and
listen
to
what
we
are
saying
for
the
front
door
is
wide
open
maybe
they
are
there
go
and
look
into
the
this
was
addressed
to
agnes
and
there
was
so
much
distress
in
her
face
when
she
looked
up
at
me
that
i
regretted
having
said
so
much
for
i
might
as
well
have
asked
her
to
look
into
the
hall
and
expect
to
find
her
mother
who
i
knew
was
securely
in
her
grave
while
thinking
how
to
get
out
of
the
dilemma
into
which
i
had
unconsciously
talked
myself
i
thought
i
heard
a
noise
of
feet
in
the
hall
and
from
where
i
sat
i
could
look
squarely
at
the
door
leading
into
it
though
neither
agnes
nor
my
mother
could
i
supposed
it
was
martin
who
occasionally
came
to
the
house
in
the
evening
though
i
wondered
why
he
should
be
so
quiet
and
while
deliberating
whether
to
go
out
and
invite
him
in
or
await
his
knock
the
door
opened
a
little
and
i
was
surprised
to
see
damon
barker
standing
on
the
outside
supposing
he
had
heard
all
that
had
been
said
i
again
bantered
agnes
to
look
into
the
hall
i
think
i
heard
some
one
in
there
i
said
whoever
it
is
he
is
the
visitor
did
not
seem
to
appreciate
my
humor
but
was
very
grave
and
did
not
look
at
me
keeping
his
eyes
on
agnes
he
trembled
as
he
came
softly
into
the
room
as
i
have
seen
men
in
great
excitement
since
and
was
breathing
quickly
and
heavily
at
this
moment
agnes
turned
around
in
such
a
manner
that
she
saw
the
face
and
with
a
startled
cry
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
throwing
her
hands
to
her
head
looked
curiously
at
barker
and
then
at
me
as
if
she
thought
we
were
in
a
plot
to
frighten
her
the
silence
that
followed
was
of
such
duration
that
i
would
have
broken
it
as
i
felt
that
i
was
the
cause
of
the
awkward
situation
but
for
the
fact
that
as
barker
walked
in
he
acted
in
a
manner
so
odd
that
i
could
not
speak
once
i
thought
he
would
burst
out
crying
and
again
he
turned
as
if
he
would
run
away
as
he
advanced
toward
the
middle
of
the
room
agnes
shrank
further
into
the
shadow
though
her
eyes
were
riveted
on
his
face
two
or
three
times
he
attempted
to
speak
and
at
last
he
said
agnes
don
t
you
know
me
now
his
voice
trembled
so
much
that
the
last
word
was
a
sob
and
the
next
moment
agnes
was
in
his
arms
i
was
in
the
greatest
wonder
and
had
not
the
remotest
idea
what
it
all
meant
but
my
mother
was
shrewder
than
i
and
when
she
began
crying
softly
i
knew
she
understood
it
and
was
satisfied
they
remained
locked
in
each
other
s
arms
both
sobbing
convulsively
for
such
a
length
of
time
that
i
began
counting
the
seconds
as
they
were
told
off
by
the
clock
and
when
i
had
got
up
to
sixty
barker
held
agnes
off
at
arm
s
length
to
look
at
her
but
he
could
not
see
through
his
tears
and
sobbed
again
like
a
man
who
had
been
holding
up
for
a
long
time
even
then
i
did
not
realize
what
it
all
meant
and
my
jealous
heart
brought
the
suggestion
to
my
mind
that
barker
s
frequent
visits
to
the
school
meant
something
after
all
and
that
they
had
quarrelled
and
were
making
it
up
just
when
the
thought
came
to
me
that
damon
barker
was
the
missing
commander
of
the
agnes
i
can
not
now
remember
but
it
almost
took
my
breath
away
and
a
great
lump
rose
in
my
throat
agnes
kissed
her
father
over
and
over
and
wiping
away
his
tears
placed
his
arms
about
her
again
and
hid
her
face
on
his
breast
he
was
such
a
large
man
and
agnes
such
a
little
girl
that
his
great
arms
almost
hid
her
from
sight
it
is
so
strange
as
to
need
an
explanation
barker
said
with
an
effort
looking
at
my
mother
who
was
still
softly
crying
and
then
at
me
who
could
do
nothing
but
look
on
in
wonder
but
i
will
never
explain
to
agnes
further
than
that
she
has
been
the
object
of
my
thoughts
and
prayers
ever
since
i
so
strangely
deserted
her
however
much
i
may
have
sinned
in
other
ways
i
have
always
loved
the
child
there
is
nothing
between
us
i
have
been
an
honest
man
except
in
the
particular
which
must
be
in
all
your
minds
and
which
it
is
best
never
to
mention
my
secret
shall
be
buried
in
the
grave
which
we
filled
up
out
yonder
he
pointed
his
hand
in
the
direction
of
the
smoky
hills
and
i
thought
his
old
look
of
hate
came
into
his
eyes
though
i
have
the
story
written
and
ned
shall
read
it
and
judge
me
i
ask
him
now
to
read
what
i
have
written
from
my
heart
during
these
two
months
and
then
tell
you
two
whether
i
was
justified
in
the
course
i
took
whether
i
have
been
worse
than
other
men
who
have
erred
and
suffered
but
if
i
have
sinned
i
have
wiped
it
all
out
by
waiting
in
the
solitude
of
the
woods
for
the
day
when
i
could
claim
agnes
in
the
dreadful
fear
for
her
safety
and
the
prickings
of
conscience
but
if
this
is
not
enough
i
will
do
penance
the
remainder
of
my
life
that
i
may
be
father
to
my
child
again
will
you
accept
me
agnes
with
no
other
explanation
the
strange
house
at
the
mill
and
its
strange
occupant
were
now
clear
to
me
for
i
knew
that
when
i
had
seen
him
in
the
middle
of
the
night
ready
to
run
away
when
i
had
seen
him
always
quickly
looking
about
like
a
hunted
man
he
was
fearful
the
little
old
woman
who
had
frightened
me
at
the
house
of
lytle
biggs
would
burst
in
upon
him
like
a
phantom
with
her
snarling
voice
and
ugly
face
and
scold
him
as
she
scolded
big
adam
yes
father
yes
agnes
said
as
she
looked
into
his
face
if
there
is
anything
to
forgive
i
forgive
it
without
asking
to
know
what
it
is
we
will
be
father
and
child
again
and
the
old
house
at
the
mill
shall
be
our
home
i
ask
nothing
further
than
that
you
love
me
and
that
you
have
come
back
to
me
never
to
go
away
again
you
were
always
so
good
and
i
love
you
so
much
that
i
believe
whatever
you
did
was
for
the
best
i
don
t
want
to
know
what
it
is
ned
and
his
mother
can
bear
testimony
to
how
tenderly
i
have
always
cherished
your
memory
and
how
much
i
missed
you
though
i
believed
you
were
dead
the
hope
that
you
were
alive
was
never
in
my
mind
for
a
moment
or
i
should
have
known
you
when
you
were
so
kind
to
me
in
fairview
after
ned
and
his
mother
had
moved
away
and
when
i
was
lonely
and
friendless
i
wondered
then
why
i
was
not
afraid
of
you
for
you
were
stern
and
fierce
but
i
know
now
i
could
not
be
afraid
of
my
father
though
i
did
not
know
him
i
am
content
that
we
commence
our
lives
anew
never
to
refer
to
events
beyond
this
night
i
am
more
than
content
i
am
happy
much
happier
than
i
have
ever
been
before
or
ever
expected
to
they
were
walking
up
and
down
the
room
now
locked
in
each
other
s
arms
and
i
thought
with
agnes
that
i
would
freely
accept
his
explanation
without
hearing
it
i
was
so
certain
he
was
a
good
and
honest
man
as
my
mother
looked
at
them
timidly
i
thought
she
was
wondering
if
her
wanderer
would
ever
return
and
if
she
would
ever
be
as
happy
as
agnes
as
if
convinced
that
it
would
never
come
to
pass
she
went
softly
from
the
room
still
hiding
her
eyes
and
we
heard
her
sobbing
in
the
next
room
barker
was
very
much
affected
and
when
agnes
went
out
to
speak
to
her
he
kept
saying
it
s
too
bad
until
she
returned
as
for
me
i
could
only
stare
at
him
and
look
out
of
the
window
into
the
darkness
we
will
agree
then
barker
said
when
agnes
was
again
seated
beside
him
that
the
book
of
the
past
with
all
its
unhappy
secrets
shall
be
closed
forever
and
we
will
only
open
the
new
leaves
which
i
hope
we
can
contemplate
with
pleasure
but
before
dismissing
the
past
forever
never
to
recall
it
again
i
want
to
say
that
i
have
watched
over
you
constantly
for
the
past
eight
years
when
i
first
learned
you
were
living
in
fairview
let
me
say
this
to
excuse
my
other
neglect
and
that
you
may
know
how
honest
my
affection
for
you
has
always
been
you
may
recollect
that
you
once
gave
ned
my
picture
in
appreciation
of
his
friendship
and
he
sent
it
to
me
by
jo
he
showed
it
to
me
one
night
when
i
had
almost
resolved
to
look
for
you
at
bradford
no
difference
what
the
consequence
might
be
and
though
i
recognized
it
at
once
i
tossed
it
to
one
side
with
a
glance
though
i
was
so
much
agitated
that
soon
after
i
left
the
room
to
hide
it
when
i
returned
and
inquired
as
carelessly
as
i
could
whom
the
picture
represented
jo
replied
that
it
was
the
father
of
the
little
agnes
deming
and
that
he
had
been
drowned
at
sea
by
degrees
i
learned
when
you
came
how
you
looked
and
where
you
lived
and
how
often
i
have
made
them
tell
the
story
without
suspecting
how
often
i
have
set
them
to
talking
of
pretty
agnes
and
when
they
told
how
much
she
mourned
her
father
i
went
away
and
walked
in
the
woods
until
i
was
calm
again
since
then
i
have
been
near
you
a
hundred
times
when
you
did
not
know
it
and
a
hundred
times
when
you
did
very
often
i
have
stolen
up
to
your
window
in
the
night
and
seeing
you
were
safe
and
well
crept
back
through
the
woods
to
my
desolate
home
waiting
for
this
night
to
come
once
when
i
looked
into
your
window
it
was
at
ned
s
father
s
house
in
the
country
i
saw
you
kneel
and
i
heard
you
ask
blessings
on
my
head
though
you
supposed
i
was
in
heaven
it
has
been
a
long
time
to
wait
and
i
have
suffered
a
great
deal
but
i
am
satisfied
i
believe
i
shall
be
happier
that
it
came
about
as
it
i
noticed
that
they
at
once
put
into
execution
their
resolve
to
bury
the
past
in
the
lonely
grave
out
in
smoky
hill
around
which
we
had
all
stood
two
months
before
for
during
the
remainder
of
the
night
nothing
was
talked
of
but
the
happy
future
the
of
their
lives
instead
of
the
yesterday
when
i
had
sufficiently
recovered
myself
to
congratulate
them
we
laughed
merrily
over
my
attempt
to
frighten
agnes
and
barker
started
to
explain
how
he
happened
to
come
when
he
did
but
recollecting
his
resolve
to
speak
no
more
of
that
he
waived
it
off
and
told
instead
how
the
house
at
the
mill
should
be
remodelled
and
refurnished
and
the
heavy
shutters
taken
down
how
the
people
who
passed
that
way
would
wonder
at
the
change
and
how
they
should
be
told
that
the
owner
had
been
blessed
through
the
mercy
of
god
i
shall
remain
plain
damon
barker
he
said
it
is
a
good
name
and
has
never
been
disgraced
and
i
shall
keep
it
it
is
as
good
as
any
other
and
it
would
be
confusing
to
i
remained
with
them
until
long
after
midnight
and
when
i
went
softly
up
the
stairs
to
my
room
i
could
hear
them
talking
in
low
tones
during
the
night
as
i
restlessly
tossed
about
i
heard
the
hum
of
their
voices
and
when
i
came
down
early
in
the
morning
after
a
disturbed
rest
i
found
agnes
quietly
sleeping
with
her
head
on
her
father
s
knee
but
damon
barker
s
eyes
were
wide
open
and
there
was
a
smile
on
his
face
and
i
thought
he
had
grown
younger
during
the
night
i
can
never
forget
the
loneliness
which
came
over
me
when
they
drove
away
in
the
morning
waving
their
adieus
nor
the
coldness
which
came
into
the
house
and
would
not
be
driven
out
i
am
certain
we
lighted
fires
that
night
though
they
had
not
been
necessary
before
and
when
martin
came
down
to
sit
with
us
he
shivered
as
he
entered
the
room
and
rubbed
his
hands
to
warm
them
chapter
xxvi
barker
s
story
my
first
recollection
is
of
being
on
board
a
sailing
ship
at
sea
and
by
degrees
i
learned
that
my
mother
was
dead
that
the
rough
commander
who
was
dreaded
and
feared
by
everyone
else
as
well
as
myself
was
my
father
and
that
i
was
kept
with
him
on
the
ship
because
i
was
less
troublesome
there
than
anywhere
else
and
because
he
desired
to
look
after
my
education
in
person
which
began
when
i
was
five
years
old
i
heard
somewhere
that
my
father
the
rough
commander
had
been
very
fond
of
my
mother
who
died
the
day
i
was
born
and
that
his
disposition
had
been
different
since
he
gave
her
an
ocean
burial
on
which
occasion
he
read
the
service
himself
in
a
choking
voice
and
locking
himself
in
his
cabin
directly
after
it
was
over
did
not
come
out
again
for
three
days
and
four
nights
there
was
but
one
other
woman
on
the
ship
the
stewardess
and
i
was
put
in
her
care
but
before
i
was
old
enough
to
remember
she
went
away
so
that
i
have
not
the
slightest
recollection
of
her
the
mate
who
had
been
in
my
father
s
employ
a
long
while
told
me
that
when
my
mother
was
alive
she
accompanied
the
ship
on
all
its
voyages
and
that
the
commander
was
not
then
so
hard
with
the
men
but
frequently
gave
them
holidays
when
it
was
possible
and
was
amused
with
their
sports
indeed
he
spent
much
of
his
time
in
her
company
trusting
the
management
of
the
vessel
to
the
first
officer
while
at
sea
and
was
altogether
very
gallant
and
attentive
which
he
had
not
been
to
anyone
since
the
mate
s
recollection
of
my
mother
was
that
she
was
pretty
and
and
very
young
and
girlish
and
evidently
for
her
hands
were
small
and
white
and
she
was
graceful
and
accomplished
he
believed
she
had
run
away
to
marry
my
father
for
she
never
left
the
ship
after
coming
to
it
as
a
bride
until
she
was
buried
in
and
neither
of
them
seemed
to
have
friends
on
shore
they
were
anxious
to
see
but
were
entirely
content
with
each
other
when
the
ship
was
at
anchor
in
the
little
american
port
where
it
was
owned
all
hands
went
away
for
a
time
except
my
father
and
his
young
bride
and
the
mate
said
they
seemed
to
be
sorry
when
the
noisy
rough
men
came
back
again
as
if
they
had
greatly
enjoyed
being
alone
my
father
kept
her
picture
in
an
expensive
case
in
his
room
and
although
i
frequently
saw
him
looking
at
it
himself
indeed
when
he
was
not
busy
with
the
maps
and
charts
he
had
the
picture
on
the
table
in
front
of
him
i
was
only
permitted
to
see
the
face
on
rare
occasions
as
on
holidays
or
after
i
had
learned
my
lessons
particularly
well
when
he
held
it
before
me
for
a
few
moments
but
never
allowing
me
to
take
it
in
my
own
hands
when
i
was
still
a
very
little
boy
i
excused
much
of
his
neglect
of
me
because
of
the
grief
he
felt
over
my
mother
s
death
and
i
think
my
first
thoughts
were
that
he
in
some
way
laid
it
all
to
me
for
when
i
caught
him
looking
at
me
his
face
was
covered
with
a
frown
and
i
almost
expected
him
to
grasp
my
throat
and
inquire
why
i
had
been
so
wicked
and
so
inconsiderate
of
his
feelings
for
a
great
many
years
i
believed
her
death
was
due
to
some
blunder
of
mine
and
i
suppose
this
was
one
reason
why
i
avoided
my
father
as
much
as
possible
that
he
might
not
accuse
me
of
it
i
lived
on
the
sea
never
being
away
from
it
a
day
until
i
was
fourteen
years
old
and
occupying
a
little
room
connected
with
my
father
s
cabin
was
compelled
to
study
a
certain
number
of
hours
each
day
and
recite
to
him
at
night
if
i
did
not
learn
as
much
during
the
day
as
he
thought
i
ought
to
learn
he
sent
for
a
sailor
and
ordered
me
whipped
but
the
sailors
were
my
friends
and
begging
me
to
apply
myself
more
in
the
future
beat
the
masts
instead
of
my
legs
but
usually
i
learned
my
lessons
to
amuse
myself
for
he
would
not
allow
me
to
talk
with
the
sailors
and
did
not
talk
to
me
himself
so
that
i
was
very
lonely
and
studied
my
books
from
necessity
although
i
never
attended
school
in
this
way
i
became
something
of
a
scholar
for
i
did
little
else
than
study
under
my
father
s
hard
tutelage
for
eight
years
from
the
day
i
was
five
years
old
until
i
was
thirteen
when
he
began
to
grow
tired
of
teaching
me
being
an
educated
man
himself
he
taught
me
everything
it
was
necessary
for
one
in
my
position
to
know
and
selected
my
studies
with
so
much
good
judgment
and
instructed
me
with
so
much
vigor
and
clearness
that
i
could
not
have
learned
more
during
a
like
number
of
years
at
school
after
i
was
nine
years
old
he
gave
me
permission
to
mingle
with
the
sailors
to
learn
their
languages
for
nearly
every
country
under
sunlight
was
represented
in
the
forecastle
mess
and
after
that
i
spent
all
my
idle
time
among
them
telling
them
the
story
of
the
stars
in
return
for
their
strange
words
or
explaining
the
mysteries
of
the
winds
and
currents
i
have
said
that
before
this
he
did
not
allow
me
to
talk
to
the
men
but
perhaps
i
had
better
write
that
it
was
generally
understood
that
i
should
not
mingle
with
them
freely
so
that
we
were
all
conspirators
in
getting
together
the
most
pleasant
recollection
of
my
youth
is
of
taking
an
occasional
dinner
with
the
sailors
or
of
spending
an
hour
with
them
when
they
were
off
watch
when
there
was
always
a
lookout
to
give
notice
should
the
captain
approach
although
we
were
always
changing
crews
they
were
all
my
friends
and
the
companions
of
my
boyhood
were
gray
and
grizzled
men
who
adapted
themselves
to
my
condition
and
did
whatever
pleased
me
most
ours
was
a
merchant
ship
though
we
carried
a
few
passengers
and
as
the
voyages
were
long
i
became
well
acquainted
with
them
for
i
sat
beside
my
father
at
the
cabin
table
and
was
a
great
deal
in
their
company
when
not
engaged
with
the
books
what
i
know
of
manners
and
of
polite
society
i
learned
from
them
and
although
i
thought
i
liked
every
new
set
the
best
i
believe
i
cried
equally
hard
when
any
of
them
went
away
there
were
many
brides
among
them
going
with
their
husbands
to
homes
in
distant
countries
and
after
hearing
of
my
strange
childhood
they
were
all
very
kind
to
me
frequently
they
asked
my
father
to
allow
me
to
visit
them
at
their
homes
until
his
ship
touched
again
at
the
port
where
they
left
us
but
always
to
my
inexpressible
sorrow
he
refused
saying
he
was
liable
to
put
the
vessel
into
another
trade
at
any
time
i
do
not
remember
that
we
ever
had
children
for
passengers
except
very
small
ones
so
that
i
grew
up
entirely
in
the
company
of
my
elders
and
do
not
now
feel
that
i
ever
had
any
childhood
at
all
when
fifteen
years
old
i
was
permitted
to
go
on
an
excursion
into
the
interior
with
a
party
of
the
men
while
the
ship
was
lying
at
a
spanish
town
and
by
an
accident
i
was
separated
from
the
rest
and
did
not
find
my
way
back
for
two
days
when
the
men
returned
my
father
supposed
i
had
run
away
and
sailed
without
me
leaving
my
effects
at
a
shipping
office
in
case
i
should
call
for
them
together
with
a
sum
of
money
which
was
to
be
forwarded
to
him
unless
claimed
in
a
given
number
of
weeks
i
really
felt
relief
when
i
found
that
i
was
free
i
had
lived
so
wretchedly
with
my
father
and
by
representing
my
dilemma
to
other
captains
whose
ships
were
in
i
had
no
difficulty
in
securing
a
situation
which
i
desired
more
than
a
passage
to
my
own
country
and
engaged
with
a
captain
who
was
going
in
an
entirely
opposite
direction
having
studied
navigation
with
my
father
i
was
able
to
make
myself
useful
to
the
captain
who
employed
me
and
i
remained
in
his
service
a
number
of
years
at
first
as
his
secretary
and
finally
as
confidential
adviser
and
third
officer
during
which
time
i
learned
accidentally
that
my
father
was
dead
and
that
his
estate
did
not
pay
his
debts
this
induced
me
to
hoard
my
earnings
which
were
considerable
and
when
i
was
twenty
i
was
part
owner
and
third
officer
of
a
ship
sailing
between
a
small
american
port
and
the
indies
after
i
had
been
at
this
a
year
or
two
my
vessel
was
put
in
the
docks
for
repairs
and
having
nothing
else
to
do
i
fell
in
love
which
is
the
part
of
my
history
upon
which
i
shall
dwell
the
girl
with
whom
i
became
acquainted
i
can
not
say
infatuated
for
i
never
was
i
suppose
it
was
a
kind
of
curiosity
and
who
afterwards
became
my
wife
was
the
only
one
i
had
ever
known
since
reaching
manhood
and
i
persisted
in
calling
at
her
house
mainly
because
she
had
told
me
that
her
father
and
mother
objected
to
it
though
i
can
not
see
why
they
should
as
my
station
in
life
was
better
than
theirs
and
i
had
excellent
prospects
i
do
not
offer
it
as
an
excuse
for
my
later
conduct
but
it
is
really
the
case
that
i
never
asked
her
to
become
my
wife
she
took
it
for
granted
that
i
desired
to
marry
her
and
said
one
evening
that
since
it
was
well
understood
that
we
were
to
be
married
some
time
nothing
of
the
kind
was
well
understood
we
might
as
well
agree
on
a
date
and
in
my
weakness
i
said
the
sooner
the
better
or
something
to
that
effect
which
she
understood
as
a
proposal
and
accepted
in
due
form
there
was
never
any
love
between
us
but
she
always
gave
me
to
understand
that
i
was
distressing
her
by
being
there
against
her
father
s
will
and
never
having
known
a
woman
before
i
supposed
the
kind
of
regard
she
had
for
me
was
all
that
women
generally
gave
and
to
vindicate
her
and
to
show
her
father
that
he
was
mistaken
in
his
judgment
of
me
i
allowed
the
matter
to
go
on
until
we
were
married
although
i
assure
you
that
there
was
never
a
moment
that
i
was
not
trying
to
devise
some
means
to
get
out
of
it
being
convinced
that
it
would
never
do
i
am
too
old
a
man
and
i
hope
too
honorable
to
misrepresent
any
particular
in
the
story
i
am
telling
therefore
i
have
been
careful
to
write
only
the
exact
truth
the
benefit
of
a
doubt
always
being
given
to
the
dead
i
soon
saw
that
i
had
made
a
mistake
but
hoped
for
the
best
and
after
making
extensive
arrangements
for
her
comfort
sailed
on
a
voyage
which
occupied
me
a
year
and
a
half
on
returning
i
found
that
a
daughter
had
been
born
to
me
but
in
spite
of
this
i
formed
such
a
dislike
for
my
wife
that
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
i
treated
her
civilly
during
the
few
months
i
was
at
home
the
child
became
very
dear
to
me
but
as
my
love
for
it
grew
my
repugnance
for
the
mother
increased
so
much
that
i
sailed
earlier
than
at
first
intended
i
was
captain
of
the
ship
by
this
time
to
be
out
of
her
company
i
had
not
been
at
sea
a
week
until
i
began
to
dread
to
return
and
often
i
seriously
contemplated
drowning
to
be
rid
of
it
all
but
when
i
thought
of
the
pretty
child
i
tried
to
banish
the
thought
for
her
sake
though
i
could
not
do
it
and
as
we
neared
home
on
the
return
trip
i
dreaded
my
native
town
as
i
dreaded
sunken
reefs
and
rocks
the
crew
counted
the
days
until
they
could
expect
to
see
their
wives
and
sweethearts
waving
welcome
from
the
shore
but
the
thought
of
a
meeting
with
my
wife
was
horrible
beyond
my
ability
to
relate
i
thought
of
it
in
a
hundred
different
ways
trying
to
devise
some
way
to
rob
the
meeting
of
its
terror
but
i
could
never
arrange
it
satisfactorily
and
suffered
as
the
damned
are
said
to
suffer
on
coming
home
i
dreaded
most
to
kiss
her
as
i
was
expected
to
do
and
next
to
that
the
first
meeting
i
can
not
explain
to
you
this
aversion
fully
but
it
was
so
strong
that
i
was
constantly
in
the
most
horrible
misery
and
the
more
i
thought
of
it
the
more
i
loathed
her
i
am
crowding
the
results
of
several
years
into
a
few
lines
during
which
time
i
came
and
went
the
aversion
all
the
time
growing
upon
me
sometimes
i
was
at
home
only
a
week
at
other
times
a
month
or
more
and
the
length
of
the
voyages
varied
in
the
same
manner
i
will
not
worry
you
with
the
details
it
is
enough
to
say
that
she
was
petulant
an
invalid
uninviting
in
person
without
charms
of
any
kind
and
utterly
lacking
in
what
is
now
known
as
common
sense
it
will
be
said
you
will
remark
it
no
doubt
that
i
should
have
made
these
discoveries
before
i
married
her
which
is
true
i
should
have
but
i
did
not
as
others
have
failed
to
make
vitally
important
discoveries
until
it
was
too
late
to
take
advantage
of
them
hence
this
candid
avowal
of
my
disgraceful
history
i
wish
to
say
again
that
i
make
these
statements
with
all
respect
to
the
charity
which
should
be
shown
the
memory
of
the
dead
yet
in
justification
of
myself
it
is
necessary
to
tell
the
truth
which
may
be
spoken
with
propriety
at
any
time
other
men
s
wives
were
intellectual
if
not
beautiful
or
beautiful
if
not
intellectual
but
mine
was
neither
it
is
my
candid
judgment
and
i
write
it
with
sorrow
and
pity
that
she
had
not
a
single
good
quality
i
have
thought
it
all
over
before
proceeding
and
assert
it
again
not
one
i
think
she
never
went
to
bed
in
her
life
that
she
did
not
drink
some
sort
of
tea
for
some
sort
of
complaint
and
it
was
her
only
boast
that
in
all
the
world
a
woman
could
not
be
found
who
bore
up
as
well
as
she
did
she
took
pride
in
nothing
else
she
had
no
other
ambition
than
to
demonstrate
that
such
was
the
case
and
had
no
other
delight
than
to
cite
evidences
of
it
i
beg
you
will
remember
that
these
are
cold
calculated
assertions
of
fact
and
not
illustrative
in
any
degree
i
have
spent
several
weeks
in
writing
this
letter
in
a
manner
that
can
not
be
misconstrued
every
word
has
been
weighed
and
put
down
after
its
effect
and
the
impression
it
would
convey
had
been
carefully
considered
she
took
not
the
slightest
interest
in
me
nor
my
affairs
indeed
she
took
interest
in
nothing
except
her
family
which
worried
her
so
much
that
frequently
she
awakened
in
the
night
and
cried
for
hours
like
a
silly
child
for
fear
her
mother
or
her
father
or
her
brothers
or
her
sisters
were
not
well
although
there
would
not
be
the
slightest
reason
to
suppose
they
were
not
enjoying
their
usual
health
this
circumstance
is
particularly
worthy
of
note
when
it
is
known
that
she
did
not
get
along
with
her
family
for
they
were
always
quarrelling
when
together
and
although
they
were
the
most
ordinary
people
she
talked
of
them
and
wondered
what
would
they
say
to
this
or
that
so
much
that
i
gently
remonstrated
with
her
this
she
construed
into
an
attack
and
while
i
lived
with
her
she
regularly
vindicated
her
family
whenever
i
came
into
her
presence
in
a
manner
indicating
that
they
were
of
royal
blood
they
moved
away
from
there
after
we
had
been
married
a
few
years
and
this
gave
her
occasion
to
bewail
her
separation
from
them
which
she
never
lost
opportunity
to
do
her
father
was
a
perfect
type
of
a
common
man
the
mother
was
a
little
better
perhaps
but
the
brothers
and
sisters
did
not
average
with
the
young
people
in
the
poor
town
where
they
were
brought
up
so
that
this
great
admiration
was
unwarranted
and
ridiculous
but
if
it
were
disagreeable
when
her
family
were
in
the
same
town
with
us
it
was
unbearable
when
they
were
away
for
every
month
of
their
separation
she
added
a
hall
park
or
castle
to
her
father
s
possessions
which
consisted
in
reality
of
battered
household
goods
that
a
really
vigorous
man
could
have
carried
away
on
his
back
finally
i
began
to
think
seriously
of
running
away
inasmuch
as
this
is
a
hurried
sketch
of
my
life
i
will
mention
as
a
single
example
of
how
we
lived
and
which
might
be
multiplied
by
any
figure
below
a
thousand
that
if
i
complained
that
we
seldom
had
fish
on
the
table
we
had
fish
regularly
thereafter
until
i
complained
that
we
had
nothing
else
whereupon
she
said
i
was
a
grumbler
and
hard
to
please
and
from
that
time
fish
was
banished
from
the
house
no
matter
how
much
i
longed
for
fish
after
that
i
was
afraid
to
ask
for
it
for
we
would
then
get
nothing
else
i
think
i
never
sat
down
at
the
table
with
her
that
she
did
not
bring
out
a
depraved
private
dish
for
herself
which
i
abhorred
and
despised
tripe
boiled
in
vinegar
was
one
of
these
roasted
cheese
was
another
and
the
fumes
from
either
made
me
so
sick
that
i
was
compelled
to
get
up
and
go
out
she
persisted
in
bringing
these
dishes
to
the
table
to
show
her
spirit
although
many
times
she
did
not
want
them
i
am
thoroughly
convinced
in
addition
to
the
disagreeable
qualities
i
have
hastily
mentioned
she
was
always
complaining
if
not
of
me
of
her
health
if
not
of
her
health
of
the
trouble
the
child
was
or
of
the
house
in
which
we
lived
which
i
am
certain
was
the
best
she
had
ever
seen
but
she
never
complained
of
my
long
voyages
and
i
think
she
enjoyed
my
absence
as
much
as
i
did
hers
in
short
although
by
this
time
i
realized
the
fitness
of
a
suitable
marriage
i
knew
mine
was
the
most
unsuitable
in
the
world
that
we
had
nothing
in
common
that
we
should
grow
gradually
worse
instead
of
better
and
that
i
should
surely
become
by
reason
of
it
a
dissatisfied
incapable
and
worthless
man
therefore
i
began
to
weigh
the
consequences
of
running
away
this
brought
to
mind
the
love
i
bore
the
child
which
had
grown
steadily
during
the
eight
years
since
she
was
born
and
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
if
i
remained
as
i
was
i
should
become
a
man
so
gross
and
selfish
as
to
shrink
under
her
increasing
intelligence
and
refinement
for
she
was
as
pure
and
good
as
an
angel
and
i
concluded
it
would
be
better
for
her
to
think
of
me
as
a
good
man
dead
than
as
a
bad
man
alive
therefore
after
i
had
lived
in
the
manner
i
have
described
for
nearly
nine
years
making
my
voyages
as
long
as
possible
i
went
away
and
determined
never
to
return
the
more
i
thought
of
it
once
i
was
away
the
stronger
my
determination
became
never
to
enter
the
presence
of
my
wife
again
and
after
thinking
of
it
night
and
day
for
several
weeks
i
accepted
the
disgrace
public
opinion
is
always
against
a
man
in
matters
of
this
kind
no
difference
what
his
wrongs
may
be
and
men
who
are
contemplating
running
away
from
family
difficulties
themselves
regard
the
offence
the
greatest
of
which
some
one
else
can
be
guilty
but
i
accepted
the
consequences
and
felt
relief
when
i
knew
i
was
finally
rid
of
her
i
had
accumulated
a
good
deal
of
property
during
my
career
as
a
shipmaster
and
i
left
it
all
except
the
ship
and
in
such
condition
that
she
could
use
it
the
ship
i
determined
to
keep
as
my
share
as
it
was
no
more
than
half
my
first
idea
was
to
locate
somewhere
i
had
no
idea
where
but
a
long
way
off
and
after
agnes
had
reached
a
reasoning
age
to
secretly
write
her
the
story
i
have
written
to
you
and
ask
her
to
decide
between
us
in
the
hope
that
she
would
come
to
me
this
hope
supported
me
and
without
it
i
could
never
have
put
into
execution
my
plan
of
escape
on
reaching
the
first
port
after
sailing
from
home
i
pretended
to
find
evidences
of
mutiny
among
the
crew
which
caused
me
a
great
deal
of
pain
for
many
of
the
men
had
been
with
me
for
years
and
were
as
true
and
honest
as
men
become
but
it
was
necessary
to
carry
out
my
plan
and
i
discharged
them
all
after
they
had
left
the
place
by
taking
positions
on
other
ships
i
engaged
another
crew
and
went
into
another
trade
which
carried
me
thousands
of
miles
further
away
from
my
own
country
again
i
discharged
the
crew
and
after
allowing
the
ship
to
be
idle
in
the
docks
for
several
weeks
i
rebuilt
and
repainted
it
in
such
a
manner
that
its
old
acquaintances
would
not
have
known
it
had
they
encountered
it
on
the
high
seas
i
also
changed
the
name
after
another
voyage
i
sold
the
ship
at
a
sacrifice
and
took
passage
for
my
native
land
as
damon
barker
where
i
arrived
after
an
absence
of
two
years
and
by
mingling
with
seafaring
men
i
heard
that
the
agnes
had
been
lost
which
impression
was
generally
accepted
i
then
determined
to
locate
in
the
west
and
for
this
purpose
bought
the
machinery
which
you
have
often
seen
in
operation
on
bull
river
as
i
believed
milling
would
be
a
profitable
business
i
worked
for
a
time
as
a
laborer
in
a
mill
to
become
familiar
with
its
workings
and
i
bribed
the
head
man
to
teach
me
at
night
how
i
came
to
locate
within
twenty
miles
of
my
wife
and
child
god
only
knows
for
they
arrived
here
before
i
did
although
i
did
not
know
it
until
four
years
afterward
as
i
have
already
related
what
has
occurred
since
you
know
one
more
paragraph
and
i
dismiss
this
part
of
my
life
forever
i
have
given
an
inference
that
i
am
an
only
child
which
is
true
so
far
as
my
mother
is
concerned
but
tremaine
whose
disappearance
with
your
father
will
give
you
an
interest
in
the
subject
was
the
child
of
my
father
s
first
marriage
i
believe
although
i
do
not
know
exactly
why
that
his
first
marriage
was
something
like
mine
and
a
few
months
after
securing
a
divorce
he
was
married
secretly
to
my
mother
who
was
but
seventeen
and
a
member
of
an
excellent
family
while
i
knew
where
tremaine
lived
and
knew
of
her
relation
to
me
i
had
never
seen
her
but
once
or
twice
which
was
long
before
i
was
married
at
all
and
in
my
desperation
when
i
first
came
to
this
country
i
sent
her
a
sum
of
money
accompanied
by
a
letter
of
explanation
and
entreated
her
to
visit
bradford
and
learn
how
the
child
prospered
it
happened
that
she
was
widowed
about
that
time
and
instead
of
doing
as
i
directed
she
came
out
to
live
with
me
i
confess
to
you
that
i
always
disliked
her
and
was
glad
when
she
went
away
her
husband
was
a
quiet
good
man
and
i
think
he
must
have
died
of
neglect
for
she
neglected
everybody
except
sinners
and
drunkards
he
was
neither
and
i
think
he
died
from
indigestion
induced
by
living
on
food
prepared
by
himself
that
she
was
a
failure
as
a
woman
you
and
i
know
very
well
and
i
have
no
doubt
your
unfortunate
father
admits
it
by
this
time
i
have
told
you
in
brevity
and
in
truth
my
life
and
i
only
ask
that
you
destroy
this
immediately
after
you
have
finished
the
reading
if
you
treat
me
in
the
future
as
you
have
in
the
past
i
shall
believe
that
you
think
i
was
justified
in
my
course
if
your
manner
toward
me
changes
i
will
understand
that
i
am
censured
but
do
not
refer
to
this
matter
in
any
manner
in
your
future
intercourse
with
me
i
dismiss
it
forever
your
friend
damon
barker
chapter
xxvii
the
light
goes
out
forever
during
the
fall
following
the
summer
when
agnes
went
to
live
with
her
father
at
the
mill
i
was
so
occupied
with
my
work
and
with
my
mother
whose
health
was
failing
more
rapidly
than
ever
that
i
met
my
old
friends
in
fairview
only
occasionally
several
times
jo
came
to
twin
mounds
but
it
was
usually
at
night
as
if
he
desired
to
meet
as
few
of
the
people
as
possible
dreading
the
glances
of
wonder
which
his
changed
appearance
attracted
often
i
transacted
business
for
him
because
of
his
dislike
to
come
to
town
during
the
day
and
went
to
great
trouble
on
his
account
but
i
was
glad
to
do
it
as
i
felt
that
i
could
never
repay
his
acts
of
kindness
to
me
he
said
to
me
often
that
nothing
was
so
distasteful
to
him
as
wrangles
over
business
affairs
as
if
nothing
in
the
world
was
so
important
as
the
possession
of
money
and
that
he
allowed
himself
to
be
robbed
rather
than
dispute
and
quarrel
which
knowledge
i
am
afraid
his
customers
often
used
to
their
own
advantage
his
business
remained
profitable
i
also
heard
him
say
because
he
had
to
keep
busy
to
avoid
and
that
motive
seemed
to
succeed
quite
as
well
as
the
nobler
one
of
ambition
if
he
came
to
the
house
and
met
my
mother
her
painful
condition
had
a
bad
effect
upon
him
so
that
he
finally
avoided
her
usually
coming
to
the
office
in
the
evenings
when
he
knew
i
should
be
there
i
think
she
never
knew
he
was
in
trouble
for
i
never
told
her
and
she
seldom
talked
to
any
one
else
though
she
must
have
wondered
at
the
remarkable
change
in
his
manner
for
he
had
grown
nervous
to
a
painful
degree
and
looked
anxiously
about
like
a
hunted
man
usually
when
he
came
to
twin
mounds
he
had
no
other
errand
than
to
be
with
me
for
a
few
hours
at
these
times
he
would
go
over
his
painful
story
in
detail
and
in
explaining
his
wretchedness
try
to
justify
himself
talking
of
it
in
such
a
pitiful
way
that
i
became
nervous
myself
in
trying
to
devise
some
way
out
of
the
difficulty
he
talked
a
great
deal
of
how
the
people
would
blame
him
if
they
knew
the
story
how
they
would
say
his
brain
was
softening
or
that
he
ought
to
be
sent
to
an
asylum
and
then
he
would
put
the
case
to
me
again
and
ask
me
to
judge
if
his
trouble
was
not
justified
i
always
believed
that
it
was
more
because
i
knew
that
my
friend
a
man
of
promise
was
in
distress
than
because
i
had
impartially
judged
it
and
so
i
always
told
him
but
this
gave
him
little
satisfaction
for
he
said
that
in
my
friendship
for
him
perhaps
i
did
not
do
mateel
the
justice
she
deserved
when
the
weather
was
fine
i
drove
him
home
at
night
and
i
think
we
always
met
bragg
driving
toward
the
town
except
that
he
was
more
of
a
dog
than
ever
there
was
little
change
in
the
fellow
and
he
moped
about
in
his
usual
listless
fashion
doing
nothing
but
mischief
and
occasionally
becoming
maudlin
from
drinking
out
of
his
bottle
he
probably
watched
jo
s
coming
that
he
might
meet
him
on
the
road
as
an
annoyance
and
i
always
trembled
when
i
saw
them
meet
for
jo
s
hatred
for
him
was
intense
and
he
would
have
been
delighted
with
the
slightest
excuse
to
beat
him
once
when
he
gave
so
little
of
the
road
that
his
wheels
locked
in
ours
jo
sprang
out
and
pulling
him
from
his
buggy
with
one
hand
hit
him
such
a
blow
with
the
other
that
he
reeled
and
fell
in
the
underbrush
beside
the
road
i
could
not
leave
the
team
or
i
should
have
sprung
between
them
but
jo
realized
his
superior
strength
and
did
not
strike
him
the
second
time
but
stood
over
him
with
every
muscle
quivering
in
restraint
the
vicious
horse
was
awed
by
his
master
s
misfortune
and
stood
trembling
in
the
road
as
if
afraid
to
move
when
we
drove
on
i
saw
bragg
pick
himself
up
and
after
wiping
the
blood
from
his
face
with
leaves
climb
into
the
buggy
and
hurry
away
and
although
night
was
coming
on
i
could
see
him
on
the
next
hill
an
ugly
speck
on
the
horizon
still
wiping
away
the
blood
as
though
there
had
been
a
profuse
flow
for
several
days
after
that
when
i
met
him
i
could
see
a
livid
mark
on
the
left
side
of
his
face
and
there
was
a
cut
on
his
lip
which
did
not
entirely
heal
for
weeks
i
never
knew
but
i
think
it
is
probable
that
mateel
believed
that
i
accused
her
more
than
i
did
or
that
i
rather
encouraged
jo
in
his
ugly
moods
which
was
not
the
case
though
i
confess
that
i
did
little
to
effect
a
reconciliation
being
impressed
from
the
first
that
it
was
impossible
his
humiliation
was
so
intense
that
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
speak
lightly
of
it
as
though
he
were
a
weak
man
harboring
a
caprice
and
i
still
believe
that
in
this
i
was
right
anyway
she
barely
recognized
my
presence
when
i
went
there
at
night
with
her
husband
and
never
spoke
to
me
about
the
trouble
between
them
i
was
more
impressed
on
each
visit
that
she
was
helpless
and
had
not
the
strength
to
attempt
to
reclaim
him
from
his
depression
or
else
she
had
tried
everything
at
the
beginning
and
given
up
in
despair
had
she
attempted
to
win
him
back
to
her
he
would
have
told
me
but
as
he
only
spoke
of
the
ease
with
which
she
accepted
his
request
to
never
show
him
the
slightest
attention
i
am
sure
she
never
did
although
i
can
not
now
remember
whether
he
told
me
directly
or
whether
i
learned
it
from
all
that
was
said
i
knew
that
he
was
always
waiting
for
her
to
ask
him
to
modify
or
withdraw
his
request
and
that
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
he
prayed
that
she
would
at
least
come
to
him
and
regret
his
unhappiness
but
if
she
was
not
indifferent
to
it
all
she
was
an
admirable
actress
i
knew
he
would
have
gone
to
her
but
for
this
indifference
but
she
seemed
to
care
so
little
about
it
that
he
was
ashamed
to
go
once
in
my
presence
and
often
when
i
was
not
there
he
apologized
for
his
cruelty
but
her
manner
indicated
that
the
apology
was
unnecessary
and
that
there
was
no
occasion
to
mention
it
i
felt
that
jo
was
mortified
at
this
and
that
they
were
now
further
apart
than
ever
perhaps
i
worried
so
much
about
jo
at
this
time
that
i
never
tried
to
form
an
opinion
as
to
whether
she
loved
her
husband
as
much
as
i
knew
he
loved
her
or
whether
her
dejected
manner
was
due
to
mortification
or
regret
i
was
witness
to
incidents
which
confirmed
me
in
both
these
opinions
so
that
i
think
i
must
have
concluded
that
one
caused
her
as
much
trouble
as
the
other
i
often
thought
to
speak
to
her
and
say
she
misjudged
me
that
i
would
gladly
serve
her
if
i
could
and
that
in
my
friendship
for
jo
i
had
no
unkind
thought
of
her
but
the
favorable
opportunity
never
came
and
i
neglected
it
although
at
long
intervals
agnes
came
to
visit
my
mother
she
usually
went
away
again
before
i
had
seen
her
and
only
once
during
this
time
did
i
find
opportunity
to
visit
her
at
the
mill
it
was
in
the
winter
when
my
mother
seemed
much
better
and
i
was
greatly
impressed
by
the
change
at
the
mill
the
heavy
wooden
shutters
formerly
at
the
windows
were
taken
down
entirely
or
left
wide
open
the
thick
growth
of
trees
had
been
cleared
out
and
in
every
way
the
house
seemed
more
cheerful
than
it
had
been
i
could
no
longer
as
i
had
done
before
think
of
the
house
as
the
home
of
a
desperate
man
who
had
retired
with
his
gains
and
who
was
always
expecting
occasion
to
defend
himself
and
i
thought
i
had
never
seen
agnes
look
so
contented
and
happy
as
she
did
in
her
own
home
although
she
had
always
been
that
a
great
lump
rose
in
my
throat
as
i
remembered
that
all
of
them
seemed
to
be
getting
on
better
than
myself
for
as
i
looked
around
the
pleasant
place
the
cheerless
rooms
at
home
where
my
mother
sat
the
day
out
and
in
again
appeared
before
me
i
thought
of
the
unhappiness
at
jo
s
where
i
intended
to
stop
on
my
return
of
my
father
wandering
about
a
homeless
and
disgraced
man
and
of
my
tiresome
work
which
seemed
never
to
end
but
i
could
not
help
feeling
keen
pleasure
that
patient
agnes
had
reason
to
be
happy
at
last
as
i
knew
she
was
for
every
action
showed
it
and
the
house
and
everything
in
it
seemed
to
be
repeating
it
when
i
first
went
there
as
a
boy
to
visit
barker
the
room
which
agnes
afterwards
made
into
a
parlor
was
used
for
storing
sacks
and
i
never
looked
in
at
the
door
that
i
did
not
see
venerable
rats
hurrying
away
to
their
holes
evidently
as
much
alarmed
at
my
presence
as
i
was
at
theirs
and
even
the
damp
room
where
used
to
sit
and
collect
moisture
had
dried
out
from
having
the
sun
often
let
into
it
the
great
room
above
where
we
had
the
suppers
and
the
stories
was
not
much
changed
except
that
it
was
cleaner
and
lighter
and
the
magic
of
a
woman
s
touch
was
everywhere
apparent
the
box
stove
in
which
we
had
made
the
famous
fires
the
table
at
which
barker
sat
and
the
revolving
shelf
where
he
kept
his
books
were
just
the
same
and
but
for
the
presence
of
agnes
i
should
have
imagined
that
the
master
had
stepped
into
the
next
room
to
look
through
the
mysterious
boxes
for
relics
to
amuse
the
two
barefoot
boys
who
came
over
from
fairview
occasionally
to
visit
him
but
i
found
that
the
boxes
were
no
longer
in
the
next
room
they
had
been
sent
to
the
mill
loft
for
nothing
was
left
to
remind
them
that
they
had
ever
been
separated
or
that
there
had
been
a
shadow
across
their
path
the
room
where
jo
and
i
had
slept
when
visiting
barker
was
now
occupied
by
agnes
herself
and
i
sat
down
by
the
window
and
told
her
how
her
father
came
in
and
stood
beside
the
bed
after
we
had
retired
as
if
dreading
to
be
left
alone
where
he
remained
until
we
were
sound
asleep
how
i
had
wakened
once
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
creeping
to
his
door
found
him
sitting
at
the
table
with
his
hat
and
coat
on
as
if
ready
to
run
away
how
generous
and
considerate
he
had
always
been
with
us
and
how
we
esteemed
him
as
a
noble
man
and
how
glad
i
was
that
she
had
found
in
my
old
friend
one
greater
than
a
friend
to
this
agnes
would
only
reply
that
there
was
nothing
now
to
interfere
with
their
peace
and
content
except
the
knowledge
that
some
of
their
old
friends
were
in
trouble
although
i
knew
that
big
adam
had
followed
agnes
to
the
mill
and
become
the
assistant
i
was
made
further
aware
of
it
by
hearing
him
talking
about
his
work
while
we
were
yet
in
the
house
which
sounded
like
distant
thunder
for
his
voice
seemed
to
have
grown
hoarser
with
age
when
i
went
down
to
call
on
him
he
hugged
me
like
a
bear
and
only
released
me
when
the
miller
himself
appeared
to
greet
me
big
adam
seemed
to
be
pleased
with
his
new
position
and
he
frequently
came
around
to
remark
secretly
to
me
that
every
family
had
its
deaths
by
indians
which
i
understood
was
a
reference
to
the
mysterious
manner
in
which
agnes
had
found
her
father
and
he
was
a
sworn
friend
of
barker
s
because
he
seemed
to
hate
his
old
enemy
when
not
engaged
in
this
manner
big
adam
was
rubbing
against
me
that
i
might
get
flour
dust
on
my
clothes
and
understand
that
he
was
a
miller
but
after
noticing
it
he
brushed
me
down
with
great
ceremony
and
many
apologies
as
i
walked
about
the
mill
with
the
proprietor
i
heard
the
assistant
draw
a
great
many
corks
and
pour
out
liquor
which
seemed
to
be
very
old
and
rich
and
which
came
out
of
the
bottle
in
hoarse
gurgles
i
could
not
help
remarking
of
barker
that
time
had
suddenly
ceased
to
tell
on
him
and
that
he
seemed
to
be
growing
younger
for
all
the
distressed
lines
of
care
had
disappeared
from
his
face
and
his
eyes
were
brighter
and
smiles
were
no
longer
strangers
to
him
his
old
habit
of
casting
quick
glances
in
every
direction
as
if
always
expecting
the
sudden
arrival
of
a
dreaded
visitor
was
no
longer
a
characteristic
it
had
disappeared
entirely
and
instead
he
was
quiet
in
his
manner
and
apparently
quite
at
his
ease
when
i
had
known
him
in
my
boyhood
there
were
times
when
i
feared
him
when
i
expected
him
to
break
out
in
a
violent
temper
and
declaring
that
he
was
tired
of
a
lawful
existence
murder
jo
and
me
with
a
volley
from
all
his
brass
pistols
at
once
and
set
out
to
join
his
old
companions
but
now
there
was
a
serenity
on
his
face
which
betokened
peace
and
quiet
content
he
had
no
ambition
beyond
the
happiness
of
his
child
and
a
quiet
life
at
the
mill
and
as
he
had
means
in
abundance
he
had
little
to
disturb
and
annoy
him
i
did
not
have
long
to
talk
with
him
as
my
visit
was
hurried
but
he
told
me
during
the
time
that
he
was
worried
about
jo
and
that
if
at
any
time
i
concluded
that
he
needed
his
aid
i
was
with
him
more
and
apt
to
know
should
that
emergency
arise
i
had
only
to
command
him
no
difference
what
the
service
was
i
think
he
imagined
the
trouble
was
in
some
way
connected
with
money
for
he
said
repeatedly
that
he
was
now
easy
in
that
particular
and
ready
to
assist
his
friends
when
i
told
him
it
was
not
that
he
was
very
much
concerned
although
he
did
not
inquire
further
and
afterwards
became
grave
and
thoughtful
in
thinking
about
it
in
returning
from
this
visit
to
barker
s
it
was
in
a
short
time
after
the
holidays
i
was
very
much
surprised
to
meet
jo
erring
walking
toward
me
in
the
road
apparently
on
his
way
to
the
mill
he
stopped
before
i
came
up
with
him
as
if
considering
whether
he
should
go
on
or
back
with
me
and
settling
it
as
i
drove
up
he
stepped
into
the
buggy
and
sat
down
beside
me
although
the
day
was
cold
he
said
as
we
drove
along
that
he
had
been
walking
through
the
woods
to
amuse
himself
and
was
not
going
anywhere
i
remember
him
particularly
on
this
afternoon
because
he
declared
that
he
would
not
mention
his
trouble
to
me
again
as
even
i
must
have
concluded
that
he
was
in
the
wrong
i
replied
in
such
a
way
as
to
confirm
him
in
this
belief
through
hesitancy
in
framing
my
answer
it
must
have
been
for
i
did
not
mean
to
and
this
hurt
him
so
much
that
he
looked
away
to
hide
his
tears
i
assured
him
that
i
never
questioned
his
manliness
in
the
matter
and
only
thought
of
it
to
pity
him
but
he
would
only
say
that
he
was
about
convinced
himself
that
he
was
wrong
although
he
could
not
help
it
he
could
not
keep
his
thoughts
off
his
humiliating
marriage
and
there
was
nothing
left
him
but
disgrace
and
ruin
as
i
looked
at
him
i
became
more
than
ever
aware
of
his
haggard
desperate
appearance
of
his
nervous
twitching
and
the
quick
and
excited
way
in
which
he
did
everything
he
had
formerly
been
very
neat
in
his
dress
but
he
was
now
careless
in
this
regard
and
instead
of
sitting
upright
beside
me
he
wobbled
about
and
seemed
to
be
unjointed
as
well
as
uncomfortable
no
position
was
easy
for
him
and
at
times
he
acted
like
a
drunken
man
he
started
several
times
to
say
something
in
justification
of
himself
but
before
he
had
fairly
begun
the
sentence
he
gave
it
up
and
leaned
back
in
his
seat
again
convinced
that
it
was
a
waste
of
time
to
talk
further
about
it
or
remembering
that
he
had
resolved
to
say
less
in
future
perhaps
he
had
thought
so
much
over
his
trouble
that
his
brain
was
tired
and
it
was
painful
to
speak
although
he
had
previously
been
a
robust
man
he
had
grown
pale
and
thin
and
there
were
indications
of
fever
in
his
face
though
when
i
put
the
question
to
him
he
said
he
was
as
well
as
usual
when
we
came
in
sight
of
his
house
we
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
creek
opposite
the
mill
i
was
surprised
to
find
clinton
bragg
s
buggy
hitched
at
the
gate
at
that
time
jo
was
looking
down
at
his
feet
so
that
he
did
not
see
it
and
i
thought
to
turn
around
and
drive
another
way
but
my
unusual
action
attracted
his
notice
and
he
quickly
raised
his
head
i
shall
never
forget
the
look
of
indignation
and
horror
which
appeared
on
his
face
when
he
looked
up
and
taking
a
second
glance
he
sprang
out
of
the
buggy
and
ran
toward
the
dam
i
knew
his
intention
was
to
cross
it
and
though
it
was
a
dangerous
undertaking
he
jumped
the
gaps
in
it
like
a
desperate
animal
after
prey
the
ford
was
a
short
distance
below
but
before
i
reached
it
i
saw
him
climbing
the
abrupt
bluff
on
the
other
side
helping
himself
by
grasping
the
underbrush
and
slipping
and
falling
on
the
frozen
ground
i
turned
the
corner
of
the
mill
at
this
moment
and
drove
into
the
ford
and
when
i
came
up
to
the
house
jo
had
disappeared
on
the
inside
hurriedly
hitching
the
team
i
almost
ran
into
the
house
fearing
there
would
be
murder
done
but
when
i
opened
the
door
and
stepped
in
i
found
them
all
in
the
front
room
clinton
bragg
pale
and
trembling
near
the
door
jo
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
and
mateel
between
them
i
had
never
seen
her
assert
herself
before
and
it
awed
her
angry
husband
into
submission
there
was
a
look
of
dignity
in
her
face
and
her
eyes
flashed
as
i
had
never
seen
them
i
could
see
she
had
been
talking
excitedly
and
she
continued
after
looking
up
as
i
came
in
you
have
insulted
my
womanhood
by
this
action
and
cast
suspicion
on
my
honor
she
said
trembling
violently
the
gentleman
drove
up
but
a
moment
ago
on
a
trifling
errand
from
my
mother
and
i
could
do
nothing
else
than
admit
him
he
sat
down
by
the
fire
to
warm
when
you
came
bounding
in
like
a
jealous
demon
whose
worst
suspicions
had
been
confirmed
and
would
have
killed
him
had
i
not
thrown
myself
in
the
way
you
have
given
him
reason
to
believe
that
you
doubted
my
honor
every
one
who
hears
of
this
disgraceful
proceeding
will
have
the
same
opinion
you
have
wronged
me
in
the
most
cruel
manner
and
i
can
no
longer
remain
silent
in
justice
to
myself
as
your
wife
i
protest
and
demand
that
you
save
me
from
disgrace
by
allowing
him
to
depart
in
she
was
magnificent
in
her
indignation
and
jo
cowered
before
her
though
there
was
so
much
hatred
in
his
face
that
he
looked
like
an
animal
i
shall
ask
him
in
your
presence
to
take
me
back
to
my
mother
mateel
went
on
to
say
watching
her
husband
narrowly
as
if
fearing
that
he
would
spring
at
clinton
bragg
at
the
suggestion
to
remain
there
until
you
come
to
me
and
acknowledge
that
you
were
i
felt
sick
and
faint
when
she
said
it
for
i
believed
that
if
she
went
away
with
bragg
she
would
never
come
back
when
you
come
to
yourself
you
will
respect
me
for
it
i
have
allowed
you
so
much
liberty
in
the
past
that
i
feel
that
i
must
do
this
to
vindicate
your
wife
to
redeem
her
from
the
stain
your
disordered
fancy
has
put
upon
she
swept
past
me
and
up
the
stairs
to
her
room
to
prepare
for
the
journey
and
like
a
cowardly
dog
bragg
crept
out
behind
her
and
on
out
to
the
front
gate
where
he
shivered
and
waited
in
the
cold
her
determination
so
impressed
me
as
a
mistaken
one
that
i
would
have
followed
her
up
the
stairs
and
begged
her
to
think
again
before
taking
the
step
but
jo
made
a
mute
appeal
to
me
to
remain
where
i
was
which
i
reluctantly
did
falling
into
a
chair
which
stood
near
him
he
raised
his
head
occasionally
to
listen
as
his
wife
went
about
the
room
above
where
we
sat
collecting
a
few
articles
into
a
package
when
she
stopped
a
moment
he
listened
more
eagerly
than
before
hoping
i
have
no
doubt
that
she
was
debating
in
her
own
mind
whether
her
determination
was
not
rash
and
hasty
he
followed
her
footsteps
as
they
came
part
way
down
the
stairs
he
followed
them
back
into
the
room
again
where
she
went
as
if
something
had
been
forgotten
and
down
the
stairs
until
she
paused
timidly
at
the
door
and
as
she
pushed
it
open
and
came
in
he
shuddered
to
see
that
she
was
dressed
for
the
ride
i
think
he
never
doubted
that
she
would
come
back
and
say
she
had
given
it
up
but
when
he
saw
that
her
determination
continued
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
leaned
his
head
on
the
back
of
the
chair
on
which
he
sat
i
could
see
that
mateel
had
been
weeping
while
out
of
the
room
and
that
it
was
with
great
effort
she
maintained
her
composure
she
stood
near
the
door
buttoning
her
gloves
and
spoke
to
me
as
much
as
to
jo
i
hope
that
what
i
am
about
to
do
is
for
the
best
if
it
were
not
i
am
sure
that
god
would
not
permit
me
to
go
away
surely
in
his
wisdom
he
would
guide
me
differently
if
my
action
threatens
to
make
us
more
unhappy
than
we
have
she
had
finished
putting
on
her
gloves
and
there
was
no
further
excuse
for
her
to
stay
but
she
remained
and
trembled
and
hesitated
he
has
imagined
so
much
she
was
talking
to
me
now
that
if
i
allow
this
to
go
unrebuked
he
will
be
confirmed
in
his
unjust
suspicions
i
feel
that
if
i
do
this
it
will
be
better
for
my
husband
better
for
myself
and
for
all
of
us
i
have
heretofore
said
nothing
submitting
to
a
great
many
indignities
which
his
changed
disposition
implied
but
he
has
grown
unhappier
every
day
it
can
not
be
wrong
if
i
ask
that
he
respect
my
womanhood
as
i
have
always
respected
his
manhood
i
have
felt
that
i
have
pursued
a
wrong
course
from
the
first
at
this
late
day
i
attempt
reparation
though
it
almost
kills
me
to
do
she
had
advanced
a
step
or
two
toward
her
husband
and
as
he
made
no
reply
to
what
she
said
she
seemed
anxious
to
justify
her
course
still
further
and
continued
this
time
talking
to
both
of
us
if
i
have
failed
to
be
an
acceptable
wife
it
was
because
my
husband
s
unhappiness
distressed
me
so
much
that
i
was
unable
to
accomplish
all
that
my
heart
suggested
i
have
thought
of
this
so
much
that
my
health
has
become
impaired
and
i
have
lost
the
power
to
act
i
was
a
weak
and
puny
girl
i
fear
i
am
a
weaker
woman
and
if
i
seem
to
have
been
helpless
in
the
sorrow
which
has
come
upon
our
house
it
was
because
i
was
dumb
at
the
enormity
of
it
i
tried
in
my
weak
way
to
explain
it
and
effect
a
reconciliation
but
he
told
me
that
everything
i
said
made
it
worse
i
could
do
nothing
then
but
bear
the
burden
bravely
he
asked
me
as
a
favor
to
let
him
alone
as
an
obedient
wife
i
did
the
best
i
could
hoping
all
the
time
that
he
would
recall
his
cruel
request
i
have
not
dared
to
express
my
regret
at
his
unhappiness
fearing
he
would
not
like
it
and
god
is
my
witness
that
it
is
not
my
fault
that
we
have
lived
as
strangers
so
as
i
paid
respectful
attention
and
her
husband
none
at
all
his
face
was
turned
from
her
she
addressed
herself
to
me
again
i
hope
it
will
be
always
understood
that
i
am
taking
this
step
not
in
anger
but
because
i
feel
that
i
must
do
something
i
can
not
live
as
i
have
been
living
and
suggests
action
of
some
kind
perhaps
what
i
am
doing
is
not
wise
but
i
can
think
of
nothing
else
i
have
always
felt
that
i
should
have
been
more
independent
and
asserted
myself
more
i
hope
he
will
understand
and
respect
my
although
i
felt
that
i
ought
to
interfere
i
knew
it
was
useless
and
idle
and
perhaps
would
offend
them
both
so
i
held
my
peace
if
he
will
ask
me
to
remain
she
was
losing
her
dignity
and
composure
very
rapidly
and
when
i
realized
how
pale
and
weak
she
was
i
wondered
she
had
held
up
so
long
i
will
reconsider
or
i
will
ask
you
to
take
me
home
instead
of
clinton
bragg
if
he
desires
it
i
will
do
anything
he
not
a
word
jo
will
you
refuse
your
trembling
wife
advice
when
she
asks
it
and
then
hold
her
responsible
if
she
adopts
the
wrong
course
when
jo
did
not
reply
mateel
seemed
to
think
that
there
was
nothing
left
for
her
to
do
but
to
go
and
never
come
back
and
walking
over
to
him
she
said
in
a
voice
which
has
since
remained
a
sob
in
my
memory
won
t
you
bid
me
he
remained
still
and
motionless
as
before
falling
on
her
knees
before
him
and
holding
her
hands
out
to
him
imploringly
she
repeated
the
request
but
he
did
not
move
or
speak
and
after
waiting
a
moment
mateel
rose
to
her
feet
in
a
dazed
sort
of
way
and
staggering
toward
the
door
went
out
into
the
hall
and
down
the
steps
without
once
looking
back
when
he
heard
the
door
close
upon
her
jo
ran
to
the
window
and
as
he
looked
out
his
breathing
was
short
and
quick
standing
beside
him
i
saw
that
a
was
commencing
and
that
the
day
was
far
advanced
bragg
helped
mateel
into
the
buggy
with
an
insolent
sort
of
politeness
and
seating
himself
beside
her
drove
away
after
they
had
passed
down
the
hill
which
led
to
the
ford
jo
sprang
nimbly
up
to
the
sill
of
the
window
and
eagerly
watched
them
as
soon
as
they
passed
out
of
sight
from
that
position
he
jumped
down
and
ran
up
the
stairs
and
when
i
followed
i
found
him
standing
in
the
window
in
mateel
s
room
peering
after
his
rapidly
departing
wife
as
they
drove
out
of
the
ford
and
into
the
edge
of
the
woods
they
were
for
a
moment
in
full
view
but
turning
directly
away
were
soon
lost
in
the
gathering
twilight
hoping
that
a
turn
in
the
road
or
an
opening
in
the
timber
would
reveal
them
again
he
remained
watching
for
several
minutes
jumping
down
and
running
hurriedly
from
window
to
window
when
he
was
at
last
certain
that
they
had
finally
gone
he
got
down
slowly
from
his
perch
and
throwing
himself
on
the
bed
wept
and
sobbed
aloud
knowing
that
i
could
not
leave
him
and
that
i
was
expected
at
home
i
went
down
to
the
mill
and
asked
the
assistant
to
drive
to
town
and
inform
my
mother
that
jo
was
ill
and
that
i
should
not
return
till
morning
this
he
readily
agreed
to
do
and
was
soon
on
the
way
returning
to
the
house
i
soon
had
the
lamps
lighted
and
the
fires
burning
and
went
up
stairs
to
where
jo
still
lay
motionless
on
the
bed
he
had
not
changed
his
position
although
he
was
no
longer
sobbing
except
at
long
intervals
like
a
child
recovering
from
a
protracted
period
of
weeping
i
now
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
he
was
much
like
my
mother
in
his
sullen
grief
for
a
hundred
times
i
had
sat
beside
her
bed
for
hours
when
she
was
depressed
asking
her
to
speak
to
me
but
while
she
seemed
to
appreciate
my
thoughtfulness
in
remaining
with
her
she
would
never
answer
but
tossed
about
from
side
to
side
always
avoiding
my
eyes
i
repeatedly
asked
him
if
there
was
anything
i
could
do
but
he
would
not
reply
and
at
last
covered
his
head
as
if
he
would
hide
his
sorrow
from
me
out
of
consideration
for
him
i
removed
the
light
to
another
room
and
returning
sat
down
in
the
darkness
by
his
side
an
hour
passed
and
then
another
and
still
another
and
nothing
could
be
heard
but
the
ticking
of
the
clock
and
the
occasional
sighs
of
the
unhappy
man
on
the
bed
which
became
so
painful
to
me
that
i
began
to
watch
for
and
dread
them
and
wonder
whether
the
most
pitiful
thing
in
the
world
was
not
a
strong
man
weeping
i
have
since
heard
my
own
children
sob
in
their
sleep
as
jo
erring
did
that
night
and
felt
again
how
wretched
i
was
as
i
sat
there
waiting
for
him
to
speak
when
it
was
time
for
the
man
to
return
from
town
i
began
to
listen
for
the
first
noise
of
his
approach
until
at
last
becoming
nervous
that
he
delayed
so
long
i
went
down
to
the
front
door
and
out
to
the
gate
to
look
down
the
road
when
i
found
that
the
snow
was
falling
in
earnest
threatening
a
great
storm
another
hour
passed
and
at
last
i
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
hurrying
down
to
the
gate
i
received
from
the
hands
of
the
assistant
a
note
and
when
i
went
back
to
the
light
i
was
alarmed
to
find
that
it
was
from
a
neighbor
of
ours
and
to
the
effect
that
my
mother
was
dangerously
ill
and
that
my
coming
should
not
be
delayed
i
went
into
jo
s
room
and
told
him
of
it
hoping
he
would
propose
to
go
to
town
with
me
but
as
he
paid
no
attention
i
left
the
note
on
the
table
beside
him
and
hurried
away
the
horses
were
jaded
from
the
long
day
s
work
but
i
urged
them
along
the
rough
roads
at
a
rapid
pace
every
bush
had
grown
into
a
phantom
and
i
imagined
that
one
of
them
was
my
father
pleading
to
be
taken
up
and
hurried
to
the
end
of
his
long
journey
that
another
was
my
mother
come
out
to
meet
me
distressed
at
my
long
delay
in
still
another
i
could
see
a
resemblance
to
jo
as
i
left
him
lying
on
the
bed
except
that
the
drapery
of
white
covered
everything
i
saw
mateel
kneeling
at
a
tomb
in
which
i
thought
must
be
buried
her
hope
and
so
many
mounds
took
the
shape
of
graves
that
i
mercilessly
lashed
the
horses
and
it
was
but
an
hour
after
midnight
when
the
lights
of
twin
mounds
began
to
appear
when
i
came
into
the
town
the
houses
seemed
to
be
great
monuments
of
white
as
though
the
people
had
said
their
prayers
and
died
when
the
snow
came
and
down
the
street
i
could
see
the
light
which
was
always
shining
for
one
who
never
came
when
i
hurried
into
the
house
i
saw
that
my
mother
s
room
was
full
of
pitying
faces
and
that
the
people
made
way
for
me
as
i
approached
the
pale
form
on
the
bed
i
was
so
frightened
that
i
could
do
nothing
but
kneel
down
and
burst
into
tears
and
while
i
knelt
thus
i
knew
that
my
mother
s
hand
was
placed
lovingly
on
my
head
when
i
recovered
sufficient
composure
to
look
at
her
i
saw
that
she
was
lying
precisely
as
i
had
left
jo
her
arms
thrown
out
carelessly
on
either
side
and
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
and
a
look
of
inexpressible
grief
on
her
face
occasionally
she
took
a
long
breath
and
sobbed
as
her
brother
had
done
and
she
turned
her
head
away
from
me
as
he
had
done
but
not
until
i
saw
that
there
was
blood
on
her
lips
when
it
was
softly
explained
in
answer
to
my
look
of
alarm
that
she
had
had
a
hæmorrhage
i
tried
to
make
myself
believe
that
it
was
but
an
attack
which
would
soon
be
over
but
the
people
who
were
gathered
about
were
so
serious
that
my
tears
came
afresh
and
i
could
do
nothing
but
hope
she
had
turned
her
face
away
from
me
and
remained
in
that
position
so
long
that
it
was
suggested
that
perhaps
she
was
asleep
some
one
went
softly
around
to
that
side
of
the
room
to
see
her
face
and
looking
at
the
others
in
quick
alarm
they
came
crowding
around
the
bed
the
patient
watcher
was
dead
let
the
bleak
winds
take
up
the
cry
of
the
unhappy
son
and
carry
it
across
rivers
and
fields
to
the
wanderer
that
he
need
not
return
that
the
light
in
the
window
has
gone
out
and
that
the
watcher
who
waited
so
long
to
forgive
him
is
dead
let
them
look
for
him
in
all
the
places
where
hunted
men
hide
and
deliver
the
message
that
a
pitying
angel
came
and
taking
the
light
which
offered
forgiveness
and
peace
so
long
planted
it
in
the
heavens
where
it
will
remain
forever
a
pitying
star
offering
mercy
to
all
men
who
are
weary
and
in
distress
chapter
xxviii
too
late
the
fall
of
snow
continued
through
the
night
and
during
the
following
day
and
there
was
grave
doubt
whether
those
who
had
been
sent
for
could
arrive
in
time
for
the
funeral
for
great
drifts
had
collected
in
the
roads
and
it
was
very
cold
the
people
who
came
in
talked
more
of
the
weather
than
of
the
dead
and
it
was
whispered
among
them
that
such
a
storm
had
never
been
known
before
in
the
history
of
the
country
a
man
who
had
been
out
to
dig
the
grave
came
in
and
whispered
to
his
wife
that
the
ground
was
frozen
to
a
wonderful
depth
and
that
those
who
were
helping
him
could
only
work
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
and
that
the
grave
filled
up
with
drifting
snow
almost
as
fast
as
they
could
throw
it
out
this
was
on
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
and
as
the
evening
wore
on
lights
were
brought
into
the
room
where
i
sat
one
by
one
the
people
who
were
at
the
house
went
away
leaving
only
those
who
were
to
watch
through
the
night
and
as
each
one
went
out
they
remarked
the
severity
of
the
weather
and
shuddered
and
shivered
before
stepping
out
into
the
drifting
snow
i
believe
i
felt
a
relief
when
they
were
gone
for
i
desired
to
be
alone
i
hoped
i
was
not
ungrateful
for
their
kindness
but
the
attentions
the
people
showed
me
were
almost
annoying
and
frequently
during
the
day
i
left
them
and
repaired
to
one
of
the
lonely
upper
rooms
where
i
tried
to
sleep
but
i
could
only
think
of
my
mother
lying
cold
and
dead
of
jo
in
his
lonely
home
and
of
the
mountain
of
snow
which
seemed
to
be
covering
up
all
hope
of
happiness
for
any
of
us
my
mother
lay
in
the
front
room
which
was
almost
as
cold
and
cheerless
as
the
outside
for
when
the
watchers
went
in
to
see
that
all
was
right
which
they
did
by
turns
they
wore
heavy
coverings
and
shuddered
and
came
out
again
as
soon
as
they
could
a
wide
hall
ran
between
that
room
and
the
one
in
which
i
sat
and
straight
down
the
hall
was
that
part
of
the
house
where
the
watchers
dozed
by
turns
and
talked
in
low
voices
which
only
came
to
me
when
the
doors
were
opened
as
the
night
wore
away
the
storm
increased
with
every
hour
and
feeling
that
my
mother
was
in
a
cheerless
and
lonely
place
i
got
up
and
opened
the
door
leading
into
the
hall
and
that
which
led
into
the
room
where
the
plain
black
coffin
stood
as
i
went
back
i
noticed
that
heavy
blankets
had
been
thrown
at
the
foot
of
the
front
door
to
keep
out
the
drifting
snow
and
keen
winds
but
in
spite
of
them
the
snow
had
crept
in
and
was
lying
about
in
little
drifts
which
impressed
me
more
than
ever
with
the
severity
of
the
storm
on
the
outside
going
into
the
room
where
the
watchers
were
i
found
them
all
asleep
though
they
wakened
with
an
apology
as
i
opened
the
door
knowing
that
they
were
all
tired
and
worn
out
i
told
them
to
sleep
if
they
could
and
that
i
would
watch
until
midnight
when
i
would
call
them
if
i
tired
of
the
undertaking
going
back
to
my
own
room
the
one
in
which
my
mother
had
sat
and
where
the
light
was
always
kept
burning
i
stirred
the
fire
and
sat
down
again
i
glanced
up
at
the
clock
to
see
what
the
hour
was
but
the
pendulum
was
still
and
then
i
remembered
that
it
had
been
stopped
when
my
mother
died
for
the
first
time
within
my
recollection
i
must
have
fallen
into
a
light
sleep
and
slept
for
some
time
for
when
i
started
up
the
fire
was
low
although
i
had
left
it
burning
brightly
something
i
could
not
tell
what
had
disturbed
me
and
i
hastened
into
the
other
room
to
see
that
all
was
well
everything
remained
as
i
had
left
it
and
coming
back
i
sat
down
to
listen
for
the
noise
again
after
listening
for
a
time
without
really
expecting
to
hear
anything
i
was
startled
by
a
timid
rapping
at
the
front
door
it
frightened
me
so
that
i
thought
of
calling
the
watchers
but
finally
determined
to
open
the
door
myself
thinking
it
might
be
some
of
those
who
had
been
sent
for
going
out
and
opening
the
door
a
little
way
i
saw
that
a
strange
man
wrapped
up
in
mufflers
and
furs
was
standing
at
the
gate
as
if
he
had
despaired
of
an
answer
to
his
knock
and
was
going
away
after
a
moment
of
hesitation
he
walked
towards
me
and
i
was
almost
tempted
to
shut
and
lock
the
door
in
his
face
for
i
did
not
know
him
he
seemed
to
recognize
me
however
for
he
walked
into
the
house
and
passing
me
sat
down
at
the
fire
i
had
left
where
he
shivered
and
trembled
so
much
that
i
thought
he
must
be
a
belated
traveller
attracted
by
the
friendly
light
which
was
perhaps
the
only
one
in
the
town
as
i
stepped
behind
him
to
stir
the
fire
and
looked
at
him
curiously
i
became
aware
that
it
was
my
father
his
beard
was
gray
and
his
face
wrapped
for
walking
in
the
storm
but
i
knew
him
the
wanderer
had
returned
at
last
but
too
late
he
continued
to
shiver
and
tremble
the
result
of
agitation
and
the
extreme
cold
through
which
he
had
come
and
sat
for
a
long
time
trying
to
warm
himself
while
i
walked
up
and
down
the
room
in
nervous
agitation
after
stirring
the
fire
i
closed
the
door
leading
into
the
hall
and
stood
by
his
side
and
when
he
removed
the
wrappings
from
his
neck
and
face
and
looked
curiously
about
i
saw
that
he
was
poorly
clad
and
that
he
was
old
and
broken
he
was
timid
in
his
manner
and
looked
at
me
as
though
he
expected
i
would
denounce
him
and
drive
him
out
of
the
house
and
when
he
moved
it
was
with
difficulty
from
which
i
thought
he
had
walked
a
long
distance
his
shoes
were
wrapped
in
coarse
bagging
which
was
tied
to
his
feet
with
cords
and
when
he
held
out
his
hands
to
warm
them
i
saw
that
they
were
bruised
and
cracked
and
i
was
sure
he
had
been
working
as
a
laborer
during
his
long
absence
it
is
after
midnight
he
said
at
length
in
a
hesitating
voice
as
though
he
were
afraid
to
speak
why
are
you
here
alone
then
he
did
not
know
he
had
come
back
as
my
mother
always
thought
he
would
at
night
repentant
and
old
to
ask
forgiveness
but
the
one
who
could
forgive
him
was
dead
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
or
do
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
thinking
how
to
answer
he
followed
my
movements
curiously
for
a
time
and
then
suddenly
cowered
down
into
his
chair
again
as
if
to
meditate
over
one
of
the
old
problems
while
i
was
wondering
how
to
break
the
news
to
him
he
turned
toward
me
and
said
i
saw
the
lights
in
the
front
room
as
i
came
up
but
hoped
it
was
a
sign
of
welcome
rather
than
of
death
but
i
know
now
why
you
are
alone
you
need
not
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
but
he
tried
to
brush
them
away
with
his
rough
sleeve
as
though
he
were
a
child
and
had
been
warned
not
to
cry
i
think
he
realized
in
a
moment
while
wondering
why
i
was
so
much
agitated
that
she
was
dead
though
he
had
cheerfully
imagined
when
approaching
the
house
that
the
lower
rooms
were
lit
up
on
purpose
to
receive
him
she
died
this
morning
just
after
midnight
i
said
to
him
coming
over
to
his
side
and
placing
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
but
i
know
she
always
believed
you
would
come
back
she
sat
in
this
room
every
night
waiting
and
her
last
words
were
a
blessing
on
your
he
did
not
look
up
but
i
thought
this
assurance
cheered
him
though
he
remained
motionless
so
long
that
i
think
he
must
have
reviewed
his
entire
life
from
his
boyhood
in
the
backwoods
to
his
manhood
on
the
prairie
where
the
forbidden
processions
were
always
passing
and
from
his
career
in
twin
mounds
through
all
his
hard
wanderings
as
an
outcast
a
long
record
of
discontent
sorrow
and
disgrace
with
nothing
to
excuse
it
save
the
natural
unrest
with
which
his
life
had
been
beset
like
a
hell
inexplicable
and
monstrous
as
it
was
i
knew
it
was
real
and
that
a
devil
had
possession
of
him
for
whose
acts
he
was
unjustly
held
accountable
a
hundred
times
since
then
i
have
thought
of
john
westlock
as
a
worthy
man
driven
by
a
fiend
with
whip
and
lash
always
sullenly
protesting
but
never
able
to
resist
the
evil
which
was
bred
against
his
nature
and
against
which
he
had
struggled
all
his
life
i
tried
to
decide
in
my
own
mind
as
he
was
thinking
whether
i
knew
him
any
better
and
whether
i
was
less
afraid
of
him
now
than
the
day
he
went
away
but
i
could
not
help
concluding
that
he
was
the
same
mysterious
man
he
had
always
been
if
you
will
let
me
i
should
like
to
look
at
her
he
said
when
he
looked
up
again
in
the
voice
of
a
suppliant
asking
a
favor
of
a
hard
master
and
so
unlike
him
that
i
shuddered
to
think
of
the
sorrow
necessary
to
make
such
a
change
in
a
man
of
his
disposition
i
was
very
anxious
that
the
watchers
should
not
see
him
i
don
t
know
why
because
his
arrival
and
presence
would
certainly
be
known
in
all
the
town
in
the
early
morning
but
i
knew
they
would
only
look
upon
him
with
inward
reproaches
from
this
i
was
anxious
to
shield
him
and
carefully
going
to
their
door
i
found
they
slept
i
then
went
into
the
room
where
the
coffin
was
to
remove
the
lid
which
had
been
shut
down
from
the
face
i
was
thankful
that
the
face
wore
a
pleasanter
smile
than
i
had
ever
seen
it
wear
in
life
and
placing
the
light
where
it
fell
directly
upon
it
i
returned
to
where
he
sat
and
motioned
him
to
follow
he
got
up
from
his
chair
with
difficulty
and
staggering
after
me
hesitated
before
entering
the
room
but
at
last
he
followed
me
in
timidly
and
after
looking
at
the
face
for
a
moment
fell
on
his
knees
before
the
coffin
and
sobbed
aloud
his
grief
was
so
great
that
i
feared
the
watchers
would
hear
him
and
waken
but
determined
that
he
should
be
left
alone
with
the
dead
i
stood
at
the
door
to
keep
them
back
should
they
attempt
to
come
out
but
they
slept
on
and
when
i
went
into
the
room
again
he
was
still
on
his
knees
his
hands
covering
his
face
as
it
rested
on
the
coffin
and
i
thought
he
was
praying
i
had
often
bitterly
denounced
him
in
my
own
mind
for
the
unhappiness
he
had
brought
upon
our
house
and
for
the
misfortunes
he
had
founded
but
i
forgave
him
from
my
heart
as
i
saw
his
gray
head
bowed
in
repentance
over
the
dead
body
of
the
principal
sufferer
nor
did
i
regard
it
as
a
kindness
to
him
but
as
an
act
of
justice
to
an
unfortunate
man
i
accepted
his
misery
as
his
excuse
and
forgave
him
as
i
hope
that
i
shall
be
forgiven
when
he
was
aroused
by
my
touch
on
his
shoulder
i
led
him
gently
away
and
we
returned
to
the
room
we
had
left
here
he
hugged
the
fire
again
as
if
he
were
still
cold
and
sat
without
speaking
so
long
that
i
thought
he
was
trying
to
solve
the
hardest
problem
of
his
life
it
was
i
who
made
the
mistake
he
said
finally
without
changing
his
position
and
as
though
we
had
been
saying
that
some
one
had
made
a
mistake
she
was
always
patient
but
i
was
dissatisfied
and
restless
i
thought
that
if
i
were
married
to
a
flashy
ambitious
woman
nothing
would
be
impossible
but
i
know
now
that
her
quiet
patience
and
content
were
rare
jewels
which
i
spurned
and
neglected
i
confess
to
you
now
that
i
was
wrong
and
that
she
was
he
seemed
never
to
have
confessed
this
to
himself
before
and
repeated
it
so
there
could
be
no
mistake
i
thought
i
was
more
a
man
than
i
really
was
and
that
there
was
nothing
i
could
not
do
but
i
have
found
he
looked
at
his
rough
clothes
as
if
i
could
judge
by
them
that
he
had
had
a
hard
struggle
in
finding
it
out
i
have
found
that
i
could
not
rid
my
mind
of
unrest
for
committing
a
wrong
during
all
the
years
i
have
been
away
i
have
carried
a
heavy
cross
and
worn
a
crown
of
thorns
on
my
forehead
in
repentance
but
since
she
is
dead
and
i
can
not
ask
her
to
forgive
me
i
must
continue
to
travel
the
long
road
and
carry
my
burden
she
could
have
lightened
it
but
she
is
dead
and
i
must
carry
it
on
and
on
until
i
fall
exhausted
into
my
dishonored
i
could
not
help
thinking
he
would
not
be
long
compelled
to
carry
his
heavy
cross
for
now
that
the
hope
of
finding
his
wife
alive
had
left
him
he
was
weak
and
trembling
had
i
found
her
alive
and
well
he
continued
to
remain
here
and
hide
away
where
no
one
except
my
injured
wife
and
son
could
see
me
but
as
it
is
now
i
will
go
out
into
the
world
again
before
it
is
known
that
i
returned
at
all
so
that
the
charitable
may
think
of
me
as
i
realized
in
a
moment
without
having
had
a
thought
of
it
before
that
he
would
go
away
again
and
hide
from
his
accusers
in
twin
mounds
but
before
i
could
protest
he
went
on
speaking
as
if
in
a
hurry
to
finish
of
my
history
since
i
went
away
it
is
only
necessary
for
you
to
know
that
i
lived
alone
after
the
first
three
months
and
worked
hard
that
i
might
forget
but
i
could
not
and
within
the
last
few
years
i
have
been
travelling
this
way
a
little
distance
every
month
and
i
only
completed
my
long
journey
of
my
companion
she
is
no
longer
my
companion
nor
has
she
been
for
years
i
will
only
say
she
is
as
unhappy
as
i
am
we
separated
within
three
months
and
the
first
oath
that
ever
passed
my
lips
was
a
curse
for
her
we
hated
each
other
within
a
week
each
blaming
the
other
for
the
mistake
and
i
know
no
more
of
her
now
than
she
knows
of
a
suggestion
of
his
old
spirit
returned
while
he
was
talking
of
and
there
was
the
old
scowl
upon
his
face
but
it
disappeared
when
he
mentioned
my
mother
again
before
i
go
i
want
to
say
that
i
was
wrong
that
i
am
repentant
and
that
my
last
breath
will
be
spent
in
supplicating
mercy
for
my
crime
against
your
mother
i
was
always
a
man
of
few
words
and
my
heart
was
always
stubborn
and
i
can
not
make
more
of
a
confession
than
this
she
was
a
good
woman
and
i
was
a
bad
man
and
while
she
was
brave
and
noble
and
always
true
i
was
everything
i
should
not
have
i
could
make
no
reply
though
he
looked
at
me
as
if
expecting
one
it
may
be
of
profit
to
you
who
are
young
to
know
that
i
have
been
punished
for
my
offence
if
i
have
had
a
moment
s
peace
since
i
went
away
if
i
have
had
an
hour
s
sound
and
refreshing
sleep
if
i
have
not
been
in
hell
all
the
while
may
god
strike
me
dead
day
and
night
night
and
day
always
everywhere
my
crime
has
taken
the
shape
of
a
demon
and
taunted
me
i
have
not
looked
into
a
book
that
i
did
not
find
accusing
words
staring
at
me
i
have
not
heard
a
sound
which
did
not
mock
me
and
wherever
i
have
gone
i
have
heard
the
people
telling
what
should
be
done
with
a
man
who
ran
away
from
his
wife
if
i
avoided
them
they
hunted
me
up
and
told
of
a
patient
wife
who
was
mourning
for
her
runaway
husband
god
the
world
seems
to
be
full
of
such
cases
however
secretly
i
moved
from
place
to
place
i
met
people
who
seemed
to
say
there
he
goes
there
he
goes
a
man
who
has
run
away
from
his
wife
hate
him
beat
him
he
is
a
coward
he
is
if
i
went
into
a
church
the
minister
seemed
to
point
at
me
and
say
put
that
man
out
he
has
disgraced
us
put
him
out
i
say
and
hurry
him
from
this
honorable
neighborhood
he
is
the
man
who
has
brought
reproach
on
the
church
put
him
out
put
him
if
i
slept
out
in
the
fields
to
avoid
them
the
wind
always
blew
from
the
direction
of
twin
mounds
and
there
were
moans
in
it
which
came
from
this
house
the
very
cattle
ran
away
from
me
as
if
to
say
he
has
been
unjust
to
a
woman
he
will
probably
kill
us
get
up
there
all
of
you
and
run
for
your
this
is
the
life
i
have
led
and
which
i
have
deserved
it
is
the
price
of
discontent
if
you
have
a
trace
of
it
in
your
nature
root
it
out
be
contented
though
it
kills
you
he
said
this
in
great
excitement
and
getting
up
began
slowly
to
wrap
the
comforter
about
his
neck
and
knowing
his
determined
nature
i
felt
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
persuade
him
to
stay
never
in
my
life
had
i
offered
him
a
suggestion
and
even
in
his
present
broken
condition
i
was
afraid
of
him
you
probably
remember
he
said
pausing
in
the
process
of
wrapping
himself
up
that
every
year
since
i
have
been
away
a
stranger
has
sent
you
money
for
your
paper
first
from
one
place
and
then
from
another
that
stranger
was
your
father
so
that
i
know
what
a
good
son
you
have
been
and
how
hard
you
have
worked
to
support
your
mother
who
was
so
cruelly
neglected
by
me
i
am
satisfied
that
you
have
conducted
my
affairs
with
good
judgment
and
that
i
have
been
missed
but
he
got
up
at
this
and
began
to
button
his
about
him
and
to
wrap
his
scarf
around
his
neck
and
head
whether
it
is
your
judgment
that
i
should
or
should
not
i
am
going
away
again
and
will
never
come
back
i
am
not
wanted
here
though
i
see
you
would
insist
on
my
staying
but
it
is
useless
i
have
made
up
my
i
had
stepped
before
him
but
he
pushed
me
aside
and
walked
toward
the
door
listen
to
me
a
moment
i
said
taking
hold
of
him
you
are
poor
and
old
i
am
young
and
have
ready
money
if
you
will
not
remain
here
as
heaven
knows
i
desire
you
should
take
it
with
you
i
have
no
one
to
care
for
now
and
you
need
it
i
will
ask
it
on
my
knees
if
it
will
move
you
it
is
all
yours
and
i
shall
feel
guilty
all
my
life
if
you
refuse
this
request
fearing
you
are
poor
and
in
need
of
rather
than
that
he
answered
i
would
live
again
in
this
town
where
every
man
is
my
enemy
and
accuser
no
i
will
take
none
of
the
money
my
needs
are
few
and
easily
satisfied
but
if
you
will
grant
me
your
forgiveness
there
was
more
tenderness
in
his
voice
as
he
said
it
than
i
had
ever
heard
before
i
will
take
i
answered
that
he
had
suffered
enough
and
that
i
had
already
forgiven
him
that
we
all
had
and
that
we
had
long
been
sure
that
he
had
repented
of
his
one
fault
there
are
but
few
of
us
who
have
to
answer
for
but
one
fault
i
said
i
know
nothing
to
your
discredit
except
this
one
he
stood
by
this
time
near
the
door
with
his
hand
on
the
latch
and
simply
saying
he
opened
it
and
went
out
into
the
storm
determined
to
make
one
more
effort
to
induce
him
to
remain
at
home
i
ran
bareheaded
into
the
street
after
him
floundering
in
the
snow
almost
waist
deep
as
i
went
but
he
was
already
a
considerable
distance
ahead
of
me
walking
with
long
strides
and
looking
straight
ahead
the
louder
i
called
to
him
the
faster
he
walked
and
after
following
him
almost
to
where
the
stores
and
the
square
began
he
turned
the
corner
and
disappeared
forever
chapter
xxix
the
skeleton
again
although
jo
came
to
twin
mounds
the
day
after
my
mother
s
burial
and
a
few
times
during
the
winter
i
did
not
visit
him
for
several
months
for
i
dreaded
to
go
into
his
house
and
find
him
alone
in
it
i
hoped
that
mateel
would
come
back
and
that
their
separation
would
cause
them
to
be
happier
than
they
had
been
but
as
jo
ceased
his
visits
to
town
because
i
did
not
return
them
at
last
i
could
do
nothing
else
another
sorrow
had
been
lately
added
to
his
life
the
messenger
who
had
been
sent
into
the
lower
country
to
inform
gran
erring
of
her
daughter
s
death
returned
a
few
days
later
with
the
information
that
my
grandmother
and
grandfather
were
both
dead
we
had
been
so
taken
up
with
our
own
affairs
of
late
that
we
had
scarcely
thought
of
them
as
often
we
did
not
hear
for
a
year
at
a
time
how
they
fared
and
jo
felt
that
he
had
neglected
them
although
he
knew
they
were
never
in
need
for
regularly
every
quarter
he
sent
them
an
amount
of
money
amply
sufficient
for
their
small
necessities
which
was
partly
in
payment
for
the
mill
site
and
according
to
agreement
though
he
had
long
since
paid
more
than
the
place
was
worth
my
grandfather
had
a
relative
in
the
lower
country
whether
it
was
a
brother
a
sister
or
an
uncle
i
never
knew
nor
do
i
know
yet
our
family
relations
were
always
so
miserable
and
this
relative
having
probably
heard
of
our
other
distresses
never
notified
us
of
his
death
or
that
of
his
wife
which
occurred
a
few
months
later
it
was
very
disgraceful
and
i
felt
almost
as
much
humiliation
over
it
as
jo
the
house
and
mill
looked
so
gray
when
i
came
in
sight
of
them
that
they
reminded
me
of
ghosts
although
it
was
more
from
neglect
than
age
for
neither
of
them
was
old
and
there
was
a
general
air
of
decay
everywhere
which
said
plainly
enough
that
something
was
wrong
the
traveller
who
passed
that
way
would
have
remarked
it
he
could
not
have
known
what
it
was
but
he
would
have
felt
certain
that
a
disappointed
man
lived
in
the
house
and
carried
on
business
in
the
mill
i
have
thought
that
the
trees
shading
the
mill
pond
drooped
their
heads
in
mortification
at
the
history
of
the
place
and
certainly
the
water
was
quiet
and
subdued
like
the
master
except
when
it
dashed
into
the
race
and
after
a
furious
onslaught
on
its
old
enemy
the
wheel
fell
exhausted
into
the
peaceful
river
below
i
came
upon
the
place
late
in
the
afternoon
at
least
half
a
year
after
mateel
went
away
and
seeing
customers
about
the
mill
i
went
down
there
to
find
the
proprietor
but
the
assistant
was
working
alone
and
said
that
jo
was
probably
up
at
the
house
going
in
there
and
failing
to
find
him
in
the
lower
rooms
i
went
up
the
stairs
where
i
found
him
asleep
in
his
room
but
the
noise
of
my
footsteps
awakened
him
as
he
shook
hands
with
me
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
the
skeleton
that
kept
him
awake
at
night
making
it
necessary
for
him
to
sleep
during
the
day
for
he
was
pale
and
haggard
and
i
am
not
certain
but
that
i
looked
around
for
the
closet
in
which
it
was
kept
the
house
was
a
very
large
one
and
while
he
bathed
his
face
after
his
long
sleep
i
walked
through
the
rooms
which
seemed
so
empty
that
the
noise
of
my
feet
made
echoes
as
though
a
troop
were
following
me
when
i
went
into
mateel
s
room
where
i
had
left
jo
sobbing
on
the
bed
on
the
dreadful
night
when
his
wife
went
away
i
found
it
ready
for
her
reception
as
though
she
were
expected
to
arrive
at
any
time
the
woman
who
kept
the
house
and
who
lived
so
near
that
she
went
home
every
night
had
thrown
all
her
woman
s
ingenuity
into
making
the
room
tasteful
and
pretty
as
a
compliment
to
her
wretched
employer
and
it
was
aired
and
dusted
as
regularly
as
though
it
had
been
regularly
occupied
all
the
articles
of
ornament
and
comfort
prepared
by
mateel
while
she
had
lived
there
were
in
their
accustomed
places
and
her
picture
which
had
been
taken
shortly
after
her
marriage
had
been
made
gay
by
the
kindhearted
housekeeper
in
a
pretty
frame
for
the
pleasure
of
the
master
should
he
ever
come
in
to
look
at
it
there
were
seven
or
eight
rooms
besides
this
one
and
i
thought
that
a
man
in
the
best
of
spirits
would
have
been
lonely
to
stay
there
without
companions
when
jo
joined
me
in
the
hall
we
went
down
stairs
to
supper
and
after
seeing
that
everything
was
at
hand
the
housekeeper
left
for
home
to
prepare
her
husband
s
supper
leaving
us
alone
on
looking
about
i
saw
that
jo
had
been
adding
articles
of
furniture
during
his
wife
s
absence
as
if
to
surprise
and
please
her
when
she
should
finally
return
and
i
have
no
doubt
he
was
always
expecting
she
would
come
back
that
fateful
day
which
never
arrives
though
all
of
us
expect
so
much
of
it
i
think
he
believed
every
time
he
went
to
sleep
that
when
he
awakened
she
would
be
standing
by
his
side
and
from
the
miller
and
the
housekeeper
i
learned
that
he
turned
quickly
at
every
noise
expecting
that
it
was
the
step
of
his
returning
wife
he
never
told
me
but
i
believe
that
had
she
come
back
and
said
that
she
could
not
live
without
him
they
would
have
been
much
happier
than
they
were
before
and
perhaps
finished
their
lives
in
peace
together
his
life
alone
in
the
great
house
must
have
been
a
greater
sorrow
than
his
letter
and
the
skeleton
and
i
think
he
would
have
consented
to
forget
a
great
deal
to
avoid
it
he
only
mentioned
his
horror
of
the
empty
house
at
night
in
general
terms
but
i
have
always
been
convinced
that
his
greatest
trial
was
his
loneliness
and
that
he
would
have
closed
the
place
and
left
it
but
for
the
hope
that
mateel
would
surely
come
not
as
a
humble
suppliant
but
as
his
wife
with
a
request
that
she
be
allowed
to
occupy
her
old
place
in
the
house
if
not
in
his
heart
had
mateel
opened
the
right
door
to
his
heart
she
would
have
found
such
a
wealth
of
love
and
consideration
there
that
she
would
never
have
ceased
trying
to
reclaim
it
for
his
love
for
her
was
so
great
that
he
could
not
have
resisted
the
smallest
effort
i
do
not
remember
that
i
thought
this
until
i
went
to
his
house
a
half
year
after
the
separation
but
i
firmly
believed
it
then
and
i
believe
it
yet
perhaps
i
shall
be
better
understood
if
i
explain
that
while
jo
was
frequently
at
fault
before
the
separation
six
months
of
loneliness
had
wrought
a
great
change
in
him
and
he
was
willing
to
admit
that
his
estimate
of
women
was
too
high
that
they
were
weak
like
himself
and
that
he
was
to
blame
for
having
made
a
serious
matter
of
love
in
the
early
days
of
his
acquaintance
with
mateel
he
had
worshipped
her
as
an
angel
rather
than
admired
her
as
a
woman
but
he
was
now
ready
to
give
up
his
idol
and
forgive
her
faults
as
she
forgave
his
he
had
regarded
his
marriage
as
a
piece
of
unusual
good
fortune
whereby
he
secured
a
perfect
being
who
would
bring
him
only
happiness
in
her
train
but
the
experience
of
a
few
years
had
taught
him
that
it
was
only
a
ceremony
pledging
two
persons
to
charity
for
the
failings
of
each
other
many
times
after
that
i
got
up
from
my
bed
at
night
after
thinking
about
it
determined
to
go
to
mateel
and
tell
her
of
my
conviction
but
upon
consideration
would
conclude
that
she
must
know
it
and
that
she
did
not
desire
a
reconciliation
although
there
was
always
an
unspoken
hope
that
such
was
not
the
case
jo
probably
took
this
view
of
it
that
she
preferred
to
live
without
him
perhaps
i
had
better
say
that
he
did
not
ask
her
to
come
back
for
fear
of
the
humiliating
reply
that
she
did
not
care
to
come
for
he
was
always
in
doubt
with
reference
to
her
when
there
was
occasion
jo
ran
the
mill
at
night
preferring
to
be
there
at
work
than
alone
in
the
house
and
he
was
seldom
in
the
mill
at
any
other
time
trusting
his
business
almost
entirely
to
his
assistant
who
fortunately
was
capable
of
managing
it
with
jo
s
advice
he
told
me
after
we
had
finished
an
early
supper
that
he
was
to
take
charge
at
seven
o
clock
and
when
that
hour
arrived
we
went
down
there
and
were
soon
alone
there
was
little
to
do
except
to
see
that
everything
was
running
smoothly
and
by
the
time
jo
had
made
a
general
inspection
it
was
dark
and
we
were
seated
in
the
largest
room
without
a
light
with
nothing
to
disturb
us
except
the
subdued
hum
of
the
machinery
and
the
gentle
fall
of
the
water
it
is
out
of
the
friendliest
curiosity
that
i
ask
jo
i
said
to
him
in
the
course
of
the
evening
but
have
you
heard
nothing
from
mateel
since
she
went
away
not
a
word
he
replied
with
a
long
sigh
i
have
not
even
seen
any
one
who
has
spoken
to
her
unless
it
is
bragg
who
passes
here
regularly
every
day
going
to
the
shepherds
and
returning
noisily
at
night
during
the
six
months
she
has
been
away
i
have
not
even
seen
her
father
who
formerly
came
to
the
mill
quite
frequently
i
have
about
concluded
that
she
is
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
be
rid
of
me
i
have
always
thought
that
she
married
me
as
a
penance
and
that
she
was
determined
to
be
an
excellent
wife
in
every
way
except
that
she
could
not
love
me
i
think
that
sometimes
she
pitied
my
friendless
condition
and
was
kind
to
me
for
that
reason
for
she
was
always
but
why
do
you
not
go
to
her
i
asked
and
settle
these
doubts
she
went
away
he
replied
after
thinking
awhile
without
cause
and
if
she
cared
to
prevent
a
separation
she
would
come
back
it
was
an
insult
to
me
to
allow
that
fellow
to
come
into
my
house
and
i
only
expected
that
she
would
tell
him
so
i
did
not
doubt
her
womanly
integrity
as
she
said
i
only
felt
she
wronged
me
in
permitting
him
to
annoy
me
it
would
have
been
an
easy
thing
for
her
to
have
said
to
him
that
his
presence
there
was
presumptuous
and
annoying
to
me
but
instead
she
invited
him
in
and
i
suppose
treated
him
civilly
i
know
she
did
this
entirely
out
of
considerations
of
politeness
but
i
regret
that
she
did
not
have
more
consideration
for
me
i
did
wrong
to
run
into
the
house
with
the
intention
of
murdering
him
i
know
i
should
have
greeted
him
pleasantly
and
made
him
believe
that
i
cared
nothing
for
him
but
he
had
pursued
me
so
long
and
with
so
little
reason
that
his
impudence
caused
me
to
lose
all
control
when
she
went
away
with
him
i
took
an
oath
that
i
would
never
think
of
her
again
that
should
she
come
back
to
me
on
her
knees
i
would
curse
her
but
i
am
so
lonely
that
i
should
almost
welcome
her
if
she
came
to
taunt
me
i
have
not
closed
my
eyes
in
natural
sleep
since
she
went
away
and
with
the
darkness
come
troops
of
faces
to
peer
at
me
through
the
night
however
bright
i
make
the
house
there
are
always
dark
corners
and
the
phantoms
hide
in
them
to
attack
me
when
the
light
is
out
if
i
wonder
whether
she
be
gay
or
sad
i
always
conclude
i
can
t
tell
why
that
she
is
quite
content
and
in
the
roar
of
the
water
i
can
hear
her
gay
laughter
not
as
i
ever
heard
her
but
as
bragg
heard
her
laugh
when
she
was
his
young
and
pretty
lover
in
the
rumbling
of
the
wheels
down
below
when
i
sit
here
alone
at
night
i
can
distinguish
the
voices
of
them
all
even
bragg
is
good
humored
and
shepherd
her
husband
and
mateel
seem
to
be
mocking
me
with
their
merriment
of
course
it
is
all
fancy
but
it
is
so
real
to
me
that
i
listen
to
it
breathlessly
and
sometimes
it
annoys
me
so
much
that
i
stop
the
he
had
formerly
talked
of
the
matter
in
a
resentful
tone
but
it
was
sorrowful
now
as
if
he
were
convinced
that
he
gave
himself
a
credit
he
did
not
deserve
when
he
thought
she
worried
because
he
was
unhappy
frequently
when
there
is
nothing
to
occupy
my
attention
all
night
jo
said
later
in
the
evening
i
walk
through
the
woods
and
steal
up
to
her
father
s
house
and
remain
under
her
window
until
the
approach
of
day
warns
me
to
depart
i
can
not
say
that
i
expect
it
but
i
always
hope
that
she
will
divine
my
presence
and
speak
to
me
but
the
house
is
always
dark
though
i
have
heard
them
walking
on
the
his
habit
of
being
startled
at
every
noise
and
nervously
looking
about
was
growing
upon
him
for
when
some
one
appeared
at
the
door
he
went
hastily
into
another
part
of
the
mill
to
avoid
him
it
was
only
the
miller
come
after
something
he
had
forgotten
during
the
day
but
jo
would
not
come
back
until
after
he
had
gone
not
caring
to
see
even
him
in
contrasting
his
present
condition
with
his
former
manliness
i
thought
his
sufferings
must
have
been
great
to
work
such
a
change
the
people
who
come
here
he
said
in
explanation
of
his
going
away
look
at
me
as
though
i
were
a
curiosity
and
i
avoid
them
although
no
one
has
told
me
what
they
say
i
know
what
it
is
and
i
do
not
care
to
meet
them
at
first
i
thought
not
to
mind
it
but
among
them
all
i
did
not
find
a
single
pitying
face
they
were
all
against
me
and
i
determined
to
run
from
them
and
get
out
of
their
way
i
see
no
one
now
except
you
and
there
is
nothing
i
dread
so
much
as
a
pair
of
curious
eyes
and
a
head
containing
a
brain
which
i
know
must
be
conjecturing
and
wondering
with
reference
to
i
tried
to
laugh
away
this
notion
although
i
knew
it
was
well
founded
but
he
paid
little
attention
and
resumed
what
he
was
saying
when
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
the
miller
when
i
light
my
lamp
at
night
there
are
insects
which
seem
to
have
a
fatal
fascination
for
the
flame
and
hover
around
it
until
they
are
wounded
or
killed
i
am
a
good
deal
like
them
i
can
not
give
up
mateel
who
is
the
cause
of
all
my
unhappiness
although
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
she
does
not
even
care
for
me
i
hover
about
her
as
the
insects
hover
about
my
lamp
and
sooner
or
later
i
shall
fall
into
the
flame
i
can
not
help
thinking
now
that
she
never
kissed
me
voluntarily
in
her
life
she
has
kissed
me
of
course
but
it
was
only
because
she
had
heard
that
good
wives
one
of
which
she
desired
to
be
showed
that
mark
of
affection
for
their
husbands
but
it
was
mechanical
as
was
every
other
kindness
she
ever
showed
me
i
was
not
a
hard
critic
when
we
were
first
married
as
i
am
now
and
i
noticed
it
then
and
my
honest
affection
was
frequently
wounded
because
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
do
all
the
loving
i
am
not
certain
that
you
understand
what
i
mean
she
was
a
good
wife
in
every
way
except
that
it
was
an
effort
for
her
to
love
me
there
was
nothing
natural
about
it
and
i
was
never
i
had
noticed
this
peculiarity
in
his
wife
many
times
myself
and
wondered
at
it
for
he
was
a
handsome
man
and
sensible
and
considerate
and
i
was
surprised
that
mateel
was
not
very
fond
of
him
as
i
was
if
i
ever
explained
the
matter
to
my
own
mind
at
all
it
was
on
the
theory
of
biggs
that
the
two
people
in
a
community
the
least
suited
to
each
other
always
got
together
and
married
when
we
were
first
married
he
continued
i
was
greatly
in
debt
and
very
uncomfortable
in
consequence
i
could
not
sleep
at
night
for
worrying
about
it
and
once
i
told
mateel
she
seemed
very
much
concerned
for
a
few
moments
but
soon
forgot
it
entirely
and
for
weeks
afterwards
wondered
why
i
was
moody
and
silent
i
owed
everybody
and
invented
hundreds
of
ways
to
avoid
the
bills
when
they
were
due
i
remember
once
i
wrote
in
a
disguised
hand
to
a
man
who
wanted
his
pay
that
erring
was
at
present
away
collecting
money
but
that
he
would
no
doubt
soon
return
and
make
satisfactory
settlement
i
also
said
i
knew
erring
very
well
and
that
although
at
present
a
little
pushed
he
was
an
honest
man
and
would
soon
be
all
right
i
signed
jo
erring
to
the
letter
with
an
l
below
it
intimating
that
a
party
named
leepson
lawson
or
liar
was
one
of
his
numerous
clerks
at
that
time
i
made
every
mistake
it
was
possible
for
a
man
to
make
i
knew
absolutely
nothing
and
paid
the
highest
tuition
in
the
school
of
experience
at
night
although
she
knew
i
was
distressed
from
some
cause
mateel
would
lie
down
beside
me
and
after
inquiring
what
was
the
matter
go
to
sleep
before
i
had
framed
my
answer
it
was
very
absurd
in
me
but
i
frequently
flounced
around
to
waken
her
that
she
might
know
i
was
still
unable
to
this
was
so
ridiculous
and
so
like
jo
that
i
was
really
amused
though
apparently
he
could
not
see
why
i
should
be
for
he
looked
up
in
surprise
at
my
merriment
i
have
never
doubted
that
mateel
was
constantly
trying
to
do
that
which
was
right
but
her
nature
was
such
that
although
i
recognized
that
she
was
a
good
woman
i
was
never
contented
perhaps
this
was
wicked
in
me
but
i
always
did
the
best
i
could
though
in
my
weakness
i
was
very
often
wrong
i
despair
of
being
able
to
explain
to
any
one
exactly
what
i
mean
and
probably
i
shall
always
seem
to
have
been
a
ridiculous
and
unreasonable
man
though
i
can
fully
justify
myself
in
protesting
against
a
life
without
hope
i
only
regret
that
mateel
is
not
as
much
concerned
as
i
am
for
then
there
would
be
a
possibility
of
bridging
the
difficulty
when
i
think
how
careful
you
are
of
my
wishes
and
how
easily
you
please
me
i
can
not
help
remembering
how
innocently
mateel
did
that
which
was
distasteful
though
all
the
time
i
realized
that
she
was
upright
and
honest
and
a
better
woman
than
i
was
a
man
i
can
only
say
in
excuse
of
my
conduct
that
the
more
contemptible
i
became
in
all
other
eyes
than
yours
and
my
own
i
believe
you
would
love
me
even
though
i
should
commit
murder
the
more
i
hoped
mateel
would
realize
the
necessity
of
hunting
out
a
remedy
and
applying
it
for
i
thought
i
would
rather
die
than
live
as
wretchedly
as
i
did
but
matters
have
grown
steadily
worse
and
instead
of
understanding
that
whatever
i
did
was
prompted
by
love
for
her
she
seems
to
believe
that
i
am
depraved
and
wicked
she
had
great
sympathy
for
everybody
and
everything
except
me
and
i
have
frequently
found
her
weeping
over
a
newspaper
scrap
when
i
was
so
much
in
need
of
her
sympathy
that
i
almost
asked
it
on
my
knees
she
was
always
thinking
of
the
unfortunate
birds
the
unfortunate
people
or
worrying
over
distress
of
some
kind
but
upon
my
honor
she
never
in
her
life
of
her
own
motion
had
any
sympathy
for
my
affairs
i
was
always
robust
but
occasionally
i
regretted
that
she
was
not
anxious
about
my
health
i
never
worked
too
hard
but
i
regretted
she
did
not
think
so
and
remonstrate
with
me
in
such
a
way
as
to
prove
that
she
had
an
interest
in
me
before
we
were
married
and
when
i
was
building
the
mill
i
worked
harder
than
any
man
had
ever
before
worked
in
fairview
and
really
became
quite
pale
and
wan
but
she
never
mentioned
it
although
i
was
glad
to
do
what
i
did
for
her
it
would
have
pleased
me
had
she
said
i
was
a
worthy
man
for
it
and
encouraged
me
a
little
i
suppose
she
thought
everything
came
to
me
naturally
and
easily
but
it
did
not
or
she
may
have
thought
that
much
that
i
did
for
her
was
the
work
of
the
lord
what
makes
me
most
miserable
of
all
however
is
the
certainty
that
she
possesses
all
the
womanly
tenderness
i
feel
the
lack
of
but
i
was
not
the
man
to
bring
it
out
it
was
the
misfortune
of
both
of
i
thought
of
what
he
had
said
about
becoming
a
hard
critic
but
he
was
criticising
himself
rather
than
his
wife
for
he
always
gave
me
the
impression
that
the
trouble
was
his
own
failure
to
inspire
her
love
and
enthusiasm
i
regarded
this
as
an
admission
from
his
bleeding
heart
that
had
she
married
clinton
bragg
there
would
have
been
no
cause
for
complaint
i
often
set
about
to
make
mateel
happy
and
i
always
accomplished
it
my
moody
companion
said
at
another
time
i
could
tell
it
in
her
face
and
in
her
pleasant
surprises
but
although
she
has
always
said
that
she
had
no
other
ambition
in
life
than
to
make
me
contented
she
never
succeeded
in
a
single
instance
i
should
have
continued
this
devotion
to
her
happiness
all
my
life
had
she
been
able
to
give
me
anything
in
return
but
i
grew
tired
of
always
being
considerate
of
others
while
no
one
was
considerate
of
me
i
hope
i
may
say
this
without
causing
a
suspicion
in
your
mind
that
i
was
contemptible
for
i
should
have
been
perfectly
content
had
she
anticipated
my
wishes
as
you
do
or
as
agnes
did
for
both
of
us
when
we
were
boys
if
i
was
enthusiastic
over
my
small
successes
she
did
not
share
it
with
me
and
made
me
feel
silly
that
i
was
so
easily
moved
everything
she
did
although
it
was
not
intended
i
am
certain
of
that
was
an
accusation
that
she
was
the
right
woman
though
i
was
the
wrong
man
i
make
these
statements
more
in
explanation
of
my
own
conduct
which
seems
inexplicable
than
to
accuse
her
for
every
one
must
be
saying
that
i
am
wrong
and
while
i
have
lacked
the
sympathy
of
my
wife
i
have
also
lacked
the
sympathy
of
the
people
they
say
i
am
too
prosperous
although
i
have
simply
had
an
ambition
to
be
an
honest
and
worthy
man
others
might
have
been
equally
prosperous
had
they
denied
themselves
and
worked
as
hard
as
i
have
done
many
of
the
fairview
men
are
suspicious
of
those
who
use
punctuation
marks
in
their
letters
and
spell
their
words
correctly
they
go
a
long
way
around
me
to
patronize
my
rival
up
the
river
but
somehow
he
does
not
get
along
for
he
is
extravagant
while
i
save
and
work
hard
that
i
may
live
in
a
house
like
a
man
instead
of
in
a
shed
like
the
cattle
the
vagrants
who
idle
in
the
shadow
of
my
buildings
say
that
i
am
lucky
but
they
are
incapable
of
understanding
the
work
i
when
the
work
we
had
set
out
to
do
was
completed
it
was
near
midnight
but
after
shutting
down
jo
showed
no
disposition
to
return
to
the
house
for
i
think
he
hated
it
and
was
seldom
there
at
night
there
were
boats
on
the
mill
pond
and
i
proposed
a
row
with
his
strong
arms
at
the
oars
we
were
soon
far
up
the
stream
and
although
i
tried
to
rally
him
he
had
little
to
say
except
to
answer
my
questions
two
miles
above
the
mill
there
was
a
bend
in
the
river
and
for
a
considerable
distance
i
knew
the
road
leading
to
the
shepherds
skirted
the
stream
and
before
we
reached
it
i
was
certain
we
should
find
clinton
bragg
travelling
it
i
became
so
impressed
with
the
idea
that
i
suggested
that
we
turn
back
but
with
the
strange
fascination
which
always
pursued
him
jo
said
he
needed
exercise
and
continued
to
pull
at
the
oars
as
i
feared
when
we
came
to
the
point
where
the
road
ran
close
to
the
river
clinton
bragg
appeared
on
horseback
riding
leisurely
toward
town
it
was
rather
a
dark
night
but
we
were
so
close
to
him
that
i
could
see
that
while
we
had
tried
to
avoid
noticing
his
presence
he
stared
insolently
at
us
and
even
slackened
the
speed
of
his
horse
jo
pretended
not
to
see
him
continuing
to
work
at
the
oars
but
i
could
hear
his
hot
heavy
breathing
and
knew
that
he
was
in
great
excitement
he
had
not
been
disposed
to
talk
before
but
i
could
get
nothing
out
of
him
after
this
and
changing
places
with
him
i
pulled
the
boat
back
to
the
mill
in
silence
the
next
day
was
sunday
and
it
happened
that
we
saw
bragg
pass
going
toward
the
shepherds
in
the
morning
and
return
at
night
and
jo
told
me
that
it
was
always
so
a
day
never
passed
of
late
that
he
did
not
come
upon
him
going
or
coming
and
from
his
fierce
manner
when
he
spoke
of
it
i
thought
that
if
bragg
knew
the
danger
he
was
in
he
would
travel
the
other
road
for
there
was
another
one
which
was
several
miles
shorter
chapter
xxx
a
letter
from
biggs
my
dear
sir
occasionally
a
gem
occurs
to
me
which
i
am
unable
to
favor
you
with
because
of
late
we
are
not
much
together
appreciating
the
keen
delight
with
which
you
have
been
kind
enough
to
receive
my
philosophy
i
take
the
liberty
of
sending
herewith
a
number
of
ideas
which
may
please
and
benefit
you
and
which
i
have
divided
into
paragraphs
with
headings
happiness
i
have
observed
that
happiness
and
brains
seldom
go
together
the
woman
who
regards
her
husband
as
the
greatest
man
in
the
world
is
happy
and
much
good
may
it
do
her
in
such
cases
ignorance
is
a
positive
blessing
for
good
sense
would
cause
the
woman
to
realize
her
distressed
condition
a
man
who
can
think
he
is
as
good
as
anybody
is
happy
the
fact
may
be
notorious
that
the
man
is
not
so
good
as
anybody
until
he
is
as
industrious
as
educated
and
as
refined
as
anybody
but
he
has
not
brains
enough
to
know
this
and
content
with
conceit
is
happy
a
man
with
a
brain
large
enough
to
understand
mankind
is
always
wretched
and
ashamed
of
himself
reputation
reputation
is
not
always
desirable
the
only
thing
i
have
ever
heard
said
in
twin
mounds
concerning
smoky
hill
is
that
good
hired
girls
may
be
had
there
women
most
women
seem
to
love
for
no
other
reason
than
that
it
is
expected
of
them
i
know
too
much
about
women
to
honor
them
more
than
they
deserve
in
fact
i
know
all
about
them
i
visited
a
place
once
where
doctors
are
made
and
saw
them
cut
up
one
a
woman
loses
her
power
when
she
allows
a
man
to
find
out
all
there
is
to
her
i
mean
by
this
that
familiarity
breeds
contempt
i
knew
a
young
man
once
who
worked
beside
a
woman
in
an
office
and
he
never
married
if
men
would
only
tell
what
they
actually
know
about
women
instead
of
what
they
believe
or
hear
they
would
receive
more
credit
for
chastity
than
is
now
the
case
for
they
deserve
more
lack
of
as
a
people
we
lack
the
country
is
full
of
men
that
will
readily
talk
you
to
death
privately
who
would
run
away
in
alarm
if
asked
to
preside
at
a
public
meeting
in
my
alliance
movement
i
often
have
trouble
in
getting
out
a
crowd
every
farmer
in
the
neighborhood
feeling
of
so
much
importance
as
to
fear
that
if
he
attends
he
will
be
called
upon
to
say
something
in
dispute
in
some
communities
where
i
have
lived
the
women
were
mean
to
their
husbands
in
others
the
husbands
were
mean
to
their
wives
it
is
usually
the
case
that
the
friends
of
a
wife
believe
her
husband
to
be
a
brute
and
the
friends
of
the
husband
believe
the
wife
to
possess
no
other
talent
than
to
make
him
miserable
you
can
t
tell
how
it
is
the
evidence
is
divided
man
there
is
only
one
grade
of
men
they
are
all
contemptible
the
judge
may
seem
to
be
a
superior
creature
so
long
as
he
keeps
at
a
distance
for
i
have
never
known
one
who
was
not
constantly
trying
to
look
wise
and
grave
but
when
you
know
him
you
find
there
is
nothing
remarkable
about
him
except
a
plug
hat
a
respectable
coat
and
a
great
deal
of
vanity
induced
by
the
servility
of
those
who
expect
favors
opportunity
you
hear
a
great
many
persons
regretting
lack
of
opportunity
if
every
man
had
opportunity
for
his
desires
this
would
be
a
nation
of
murderers
and
disgraced
women
expectation
always
be
ready
for
that
which
you
do
not
expect
nothing
that
you
expect
ever
happens
you
have
perhaps
observed
that
when
you
are
waiting
for
a
visitor
at
the
front
door
he
comes
in
at
the
back
and
surprises
you
woman

chapter
xxxi
killed
at
the
ford
jo
erring
and
his
wife
had
been
separated
a
year
and
a
half
during
which
time
i
saw
jo
frequently
but
never
his
wife
for
i
had
grown
to
accept
her
husband
s
opinion
that
she
was
glad
to
be
rid
of
him
i
was
often
at
the
mill
and
he
often
came
to
town
when
i
saw
that
he
was
growing
gradually
more
desperate
and
wretched
and
uneasy
in
his
manner
but
i
was
not
prepared
for
the
announcement
which
damon
barker
made
to
me
by
letter
one
day
that
he
had
secured
a
divorce
from
his
wife
and
that
the
case
was
more
serious
than
i
supposed
on
investigating
the
matter
i
found
that
the
divorce
had
been
granted
a
few
months
before
on
the
ground
of
desertion
and
so
quietly
was
it
done
that
but
few
knew
of
it
jo
had
probably
attended
to
the
details
on
his
visits
to
the
town
and
as
it
was
a
clear
case
the
application
was
quietly
granted
by
the
judge
in
chambers
who
happened
to
be
familiar
with
all
the
circumstances
i
shall
always
believe
that
the
unhappy
man
made
the
application
in
desperation
hoping
it
would
bring
his
affairs
to
a
crisis
but
as
mateel
never
appeared
to
answer
he
concluded
she
was
satisfied
with
his
course
which
made
him
more
sullen
and
resentful
the
shepherds
were
seldom
seen
since
the
difficulty
and
it
was
thought
that
they
were
proud
and
haughty
so
that
but
few
went
to
their
house
and
these
mateel
always
avoided
occasionally
the
minister
was
seen
working
about
his
place
but
he
never
left
it
and
it
was
believed
by
a
great
many
that
he
received
financial
help
from
clinton
bragg
within
a
year
clinton
bragg
had
greatly
improved
he
no
longer
patronized
his
bottle
and
he
dressed
better
than
before
and
his
temper
was
visibly
better
although
i
knew
this
i
did
not
particularly
remark
it
or
his
visits
to
the
shepherds
for
he
had
been
a
frequent
visitor
there
from
the
time
he
came
to
the
country
which
i
had
always
regarded
simply
as
an
annoyance
to
jo
therefore
my
surprise
may
be
imagined
when
i
received
a
note
from
barker
one
morning
at
the
hands
of
big
adam
stating
that
bragg
and
mateel
were
to
be
married
that
evening
i
had
not
seen
jo
since
learning
of
the
divorce
and
at
once
resolved
to
go
to
the
mill
knowing
bragg
s
malicious
nature
i
was
certain
that
he
would
drive
by
the
ford
on
his
return
to
twin
mounds
with
mateel
and
i
hoped
that
in
some
way
i
should
be
able
to
prevent
jo
s
seeing
them
i
can
not
remember
now
whether
i
thought
a
sight
of
them
would
cause
him
a
burst
of
grief
or
anger
but
i
was
sure
i
could
be
of
use
to
him
in
some
way
and
at
once
determined
to
leave
for
fairview
and
spend
the
night
at
the
mill
the
pity
and
friendliness
i
had
formerly
entertained
for
mateel
vanished
with
the
messenger
who
brought
me
the
letter
announcing
her
contemplated
marriage
to
clinton
bragg
though
my
first
feeling
was
of
horror
and
indignation
at
a
step
which
seemed
so
indelicate
and
cruel
i
think
that
during
that
day
i
hated
her
more
than
i
had
ever
hated
bragg
for
i
could
make
nothing
out
of
it
further
than
that
she
desired
the
ruin
and
disgrace
of
jo
i
even
brought
to
mind
incidents
familiar
to
me
to
prove
that
she
was
malicious
cunning
and
deceitful
and
upbraided
myself
that
i
had
not
warned
jo
of
it
long
ago
i
intended
to
drive
over
early
in
the
afternoon
but
customers
came
in
to
detain
me
and
it
was
late
before
i
left
the
office
to
get
ready
i
had
walked
about
like
a
man
in
an
uncomfortable
dream
all
day
and
could
do
nothing
for
the
more
closely
i
applied
myself
to
whatever
i
was
about
the
less
i
accomplished
tiresome
men
i
did
not
care
to
see
but
whom
i
could
not
very
well
avoid
came
in
one
after
another
and
i
became
so
nervous
at
their
appearance
as
to
be
almost
helpless
when
at
last
i
started
for
the
house
a
thousand
voices
seemed
to
be
urging
me
to
hurry
and
i
ran
like
a
madman
to
complete
my
simple
preparations
for
the
trip
once
on
the
road
i
lashed
the
horses
into
a
run
but
in
spite
of
this
i
seemed
to
make
only
slow
progress
like
a
man
in
a
troubled
dream
pursued
by
devils
it
became
so
dark
when
i
was
half
way
that
in
the
creek
valleys
i
was
compelled
to
get
out
and
lead
the
horses
and
when
i
was
yet
a
long
way
from
fairview
the
dull
tolling
of
the
great
bell
in
the
steeple
of
the
church
startled
me
it
was
a
wild
night
in
april
with
a
storm
threatening
and
the
hawks
and
owls
flew
almost
in
my
face
in
their
hurry
to
find
shelter
a
single
black
cloud
which
was
gathering
in
the
south
when
i
started
had
overspread
the
heavens
resulting
in
almost
inky
darkness
and
gusts
of
wind
came
dashing
upon
me
with
such
sudden
fury
following
a
dead
calm
that
the
horses
tried
to
take
the
bits
in
their
teeth
and
run
away
from
it
the
bell
continued
to
toll
at
intervals
not
distinctly
but
only
as
you
remember
noises
after
a
stormy
night
and
once
i
thought
i
heard
a
great
number
of
strokes
in
quick
succession
as
though
an
alarm
were
being
sounded
by
this
time
i
was
travelling
on
a
high
divide
where
i
knew
the
road
to
be
safe
and
urging
the
horses
again
into
quicker
speed
they
ran
as
if
they
too
had
heard
the
alarm
from
the
bell
if
i
was
frightened
at
the
fearful
speed
i
was
travelling
i
thought
of
the
howling
winds
behind
me
which
seemed
to
be
always
overtaking
and
passing
me
to
make
mischief
beyond
as
i
passed
the
occasional
houses
i
saw
the
people
attracted
by
the
noise
of
my
wheels
run
to
the
windows
and
flattening
their
faces
against
the
panes
peer
out
into
the
night
i
wondered
why
they
did
not
come
out
and
follow
me
and
half
convinced
that
they
would
i
determined
to
beat
them
to
the
mill
and
lashed
the
horses
into
greater
speed
when
at
last
i
arrived
at
the
mill
everything
seemed
so
quiet
and
safe
that
i
was
ashamed
of
my
alarm
and
after
hitching
the
horses
at
the
gate
i
walked
up
to
the
house
trying
to
recover
my
composure
the
house
dog
which
i
had
known
all
his
life
dashed
at
me
in
the
greatest
fury
when
i
came
up
to
the
door
and
his
old
companion
the
house
cat
screamed
out
on
seeing
me
and
dashed
away
as
if
pursued
everything
was
wrong
and
there
were
wild
cries
and
alarms
in
the
wind
which
was
now
blowing
furiously
a
light
burned
in
the
front
room
and
a
fire
in
the
grate
but
going
in
i
found
the
room
empty
even
the
fire
dashed
at
me
with
puffs
of
smoke
and
the
lamp
burned
low
without
cause
i
found
the
room
in
the
greatest
confusion
and
jo
s
bed
which
had
been
brought
down
from
the
upper
part
of
the
house
was
in
disorder
as
though
it
had
been
lately
used
i
went
into
all
the
other
rooms
calling
the
name
of
jo
but
i
found
them
dark
and
silent
i
walked
out
into
the
yard
and
called
him
but
the
dog
dashed
at
me
again
as
though
i
were
a
robber
and
would
not
recognize
my
voice
the
water
pouring
over
the
dam
which
had
lulled
me
to
sleep
a
hundred
times
roared
and
i
will
swear
that
the
wind
was
sobbing
at
every
door
and
window
when
i
returned
to
the
house
ill
at
ease
i
went
to
the
door
and
called
again
but
the
wind
took
up
the
sound
of
my
voice
and
hurried
off
with
it
into
the
darkness
of
the
woods
hoping
that
jo
would
soon
return
i
sat
down
by
the
open
fire
but
i
saw
such
faces
in
it
that
they
made
me
shudder
and
i
tried
to
listen
for
his
approaching
footsteps
but
the
wind
had
turned
into
a
fierce
cry
of
agony
or
vengeance
i
could
not
tell
which
and
i
could
hear
nothing
else
impatiently
taking
up
a
book
i
thought
to
read
but
the
first
lines
were
of
murder
and
of
blood
and
i
threw
it
down
cursing
the
dog
the
book
and
the
storm
occasionally
the
rain
came
dashing
down
on
the
roof
preceded
by
great
drops
which
seemed
to
me
like
tears
shed
by
a
pitying
heaven
and
then
the
rain
ceased
again
as
if
the
elements
were
not
yet
ready
for
a
bad
night
while
trying
to
decide
whether
to
go
out
and
hunt
for
jo
or
wait
quietly
for
his
return
the
door
suddenly
burst
open
and
my
uncle
came
in
carrying
mateel
in
his
arms
as
easily
as
though
she
were
a
child
going
straight
to
the
bed
without
looking
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
and
apparently
without
seeing
me
he
gently
laid
her
down
and
falling
on
his
knees
passionately
kissed
the
pale
face
as
he
kneeled
over
her
he
sobbed
and
cried
aloud
as
he
had
done
on
the
night
she
went
away
but
recollecting
himself
he
roughly
wiped
away
his
tears
and
tenderly
contemplated
the
insensible
woman
before
him
for
she
seemed
to
be
in
a
faint
i
thought
that
could
the
devils
he
told
about
as
haunting
the
cave
fully
realize
his
abject
wretchedness
they
would
have
been
awed
into
respectful
silence
and
allowed
the
tender
symphony
to
find
its
way
to
his
bleeding
heart
he
was
in
such
excitement
that
i
was
almost
afraid
to
speak
to
him
for
his
eyes
were
wild
and
fierce
his
hair
dishevelled
like
a
madman
s
and
his
clothing
in
such
disorder
that
i
thought
he
had
been
long
out
in
the
storm
as
he
turned
and
saw
me
he
cried
out
fiercely
she
belongs
to
me
and
i
have
protected
her
honor
the
dog
whose
ambition
it
was
to
disgrace
me
through
her
weakness
is
dead
he
was
a
giant
in
physical
stature
and
every
muscle
quivered
with
excitement
i
thought
that
had
he
been
called
upon
to
rescue
his
wife
from
a
dozen
men
in
his
present
state
he
would
have
undertaken
and
accomplished
it
and
i
shuddered
to
think
what
had
befallen
the
one
man
against
him
i
had
never
noticed
it
there
before
but
the
tolling
of
the
great
bell
at
fairview
could
be
distinctly
heard
when
i
stood
up
and
looked
at
mateel
i
drew
back
in
horror
at
the
change
in
her
appearance
her
form
was
wasted
and
thin
and
her
face
so
pale
that
i
feared
she
was
dead
instead
of
wearing
a
bridal
dress
her
apparel
was
of
black
material
which
made
her
look
more
ghastly
oh
jo
i
said
what
have
you
done
this
he
answered
looking
first
at
mateel
s
motionless
form
on
the
bed
and
then
coming
toward
me
this
i
picked
up
clinton
bragg
from
his
seat
beside
mateel
as
they
came
through
the
woods
by
the
ford
and
strangled
him
as
i
would
strangle
a
dog
i
held
him
out
at
arm
s
length
until
he
was
limp
and
dead
and
threw
his
carcass
into
the
brush
then
taking
mateel
in
my
arms
i
lashed
the
devilish
horse
until
he
ran
away
through
the
timber
when
i
waded
the
creek
and
came
here
it
was
a
short
but
terrible
story
and
his
tragic
telling
of
it
so
impressed
me
that
i
almost
cheered
him
knowing
the
wrong
he
had
suffered
mateel
still
lay
quietly
on
the
bed
occasionally
moaning
and
jo
went
to
her
again
and
lovingly
caressed
her
as
he
might
have
done
had
she
been
his
lawful
wife
in
temporary
distress
and
i
thought
his
manner
was
softened
by
contemplating
her
misery
for
when
he
spoke
again
it
was
half
in
apology
i
have
always
feared
this
and
although
i
have
done
an
awful
thing
i
could
not
do
he
walked
toward
me
and
stood
by
my
side
bragg
pursued
me
with
relentless
hate
and
he
is
as
much
to
blame
as
i
am
they
might
have
known
i
would
not
submit
to
this
cruelty
it
was
more
than
i
could
bear
and
i
could
not
help
doing
what
i
i
had
been
oppressed
for
a
long
time
with
a
vague
fear
though
i
was
never
clear
as
to
what
it
was
that
something
dreadful
would
come
of
the
separation
and
as
i
sat
there
looking
from
the
helpless
woman
lying
on
the
bed
to
the
wretched
man
walking
the
floor
i
almost
concluded
that
the
murder
of
clinton
bragg
was
the
result
i
had
expected
there
is
so
much
wickedness
in
my
heart
that
i
am
proud
of
what
i
have
done
jo
said
stopping
in
his
walk
as
though
he
had
been
thinking
it
over
and
had
come
to
that
conclusion
i
can
not
regret
it
the
murder
of
that
man
has
given
me
the
only
relief
i
have
known
in
three
years
and
i
feel
like
calling
at
the
houses
of
honest
people
and
crying
a
man
who
deserved
death
is
dead
even
the
wind
was
crying
fiercely
for
revenge
when
he
was
seated
beside
my
wife
intent
on
his
unnatural
and
fiendish
purpose
but
it
is
quiet
now
and
sobbing
in
pity
for
me
i
never
insulted
my
manhood
nor
mankind
by
trying
to
curb
my
fierce
passion
when
i
heard
he
intended
to
pass
my
house
with
mateel
i
resolved
to
murder
him
and
all
honest
men
will
say
i
could
have
done
nothing
less
he
began
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
again
at
one
moment
a
fierce
demon
and
at
another
a
man
softened
by
tears
and
i
saw
by
his
manner
that
he
realized
that
mateel
must
not
remain
there
for
he
went
over
to
her
side
and
fondly
kissed
her
as
if
for
the
last
time
perhaps
he
thought
when
he
took
her
in
his
arms
in
the
woods
that
his
troubles
would
end
after
crossing
the
stream
and
entering
his
own
door
and
that
they
would
live
in
peace
thereafter
but
he
realized
now
that
his
action
had
only
tightened
the
coils
of
misfortune
about
him
she
would
despise
me
for
this
deed
if
she
knew
it
he
said
i
have
killed
her
husband
and
she
does
not
belong
here
take
her
to
her
mother
before
she
wakens
and
reproaches
me
and
then
come
back
to
realizing
the
force
of
the
suggestion
i
answered
that
my
team
was
hitched
in
front
of
the
house
and
without
further
words
he
picked
mateel
up
and
carried
her
out
although
able
to
sit
up
she
did
not
seem
to
be
conscious
of
what
had
happened
but
sat
moaning
and
crying
beside
me
when
i
drove
away
leaving
jo
standing
at
the
gate
the
night
was
very
dark
but
the
wind
had
gone
down
and
i
was
only
able
to
find
my
way
by
the
frequent
flashes
of
livid
lightning
after
i
passed
the
ford
and
entered
the
woods
in
spite
of
myself
i
began
to
watch
the
for
the
body
of
the
dead
man
hoping
that
he
was
only
stunned
and
had
crawled
away
i
had
stopped
for
the
lightning
to
flash
again
to
show
me
the
road
through
the
trees
and
when
it
came
i
saw
bragg
prostrate
beside
me
so
close
to
the
road
that
i
feared
the
horses
had
trampled
upon
him
in
the
instant
i
saw
that
he
was
lying
on
his
back
his
arms
thrown
out
on
either
side
and
that
his
face
was
white
in
death
in
looking
at
him
i
had
neglected
to
observe
the
road
and
sat
there
waiting
for
another
flash
with
it
came
the
rain
and
seeing
my
way
i
started
the
impatient
horses
at
a
brisk
trot
when
i
stopped
in
front
of
shepherd
s
house
i
saw
that
a
light
still
burned
within
and
hurriedly
securing
the
horses
i
took
mateel
in
my
arms
and
rapped
at
the
door
shepherd
came
in
answer
to
it
bearing
a
light
in
his
hand
and
seeing
me
with
my
strange
burden
staggered
back
in
alarm
there
has
been
an
accident
i
said
but
your
daughter
is
not
hurt
only
frightened
and
in
a
he
took
his
child
tenderly
in
his
arms
and
with
the
assistance
of
his
wife
tried
to
revive
her
i
must
hurry
away
i
said
dreading
to
tell
them
all
you
will
hear
further
news
neither
of
them
said
a
word
but
i
believed
they
knew
what
the
accident
was
for
they
acted
as
though
they
had
been
waiting
for
it
and
were
not
surprised
that
their
unhappy
child
had
been
returned
to
them
alone
the
lightning
by
this
time
came
in
such
rapidly
following
flashes
that
i
had
no
difficulty
in
driving
at
a
smart
gait
and
when
i
approached
the
ford
my
eyes
were
again
drawn
against
my
will
to
the
prostrate
form
under
the
trees
it
had
not
been
disturbed
and
i
hurried
past
it
and
into
the
house
where
jo
was
sitting
by
the
fire
with
his
hat
on
ready
to
go
out
he
looked
up
when
i
came
in
but
made
no
inquiries
and
buttoning
his
coat
said
he
was
ready
to
go
in
response
to
my
curious
look
he
replied
there
is
but
one
thing
to
do
to
notify
the
officers
and
finish
this
night
s
work
in
jail
i
have
thoroughly
considered
the
matter
while
you
were
away
and
that
is
my
decision
when
i
heard
that
this
marriage
was
to
take
place
i
resolved
to
do
what
i
have
done
and
arranged
my
business
for
it
by
leasing
the
mill
the
man
who
is
to
operate
it
is
my
present
assistant
and
all
the
necessary
arrangements
have
been
made
i
only
hope
now
that
i
shall
be
disposed
of
as
soon
as
possible
i
do
not
regret
what
i
have
done
now
that
it
is
done
and
the
most
pleasant
moment
of
my
life
was
when
i
clutched
the
throat
of
the
man
who
has
been
relentlessly
pursuing
me
for
five
years
he
could
not
be
induced
to
give
up
his
design
and
i
could
do
nothing
else
than
murder
him
i
have
only
lived
for
the
past
few
months
to
guard
mateel
against
him
and
now
that
she
is
no
longer
in
danger
i
am
ready
for
the
worst
when
i
looked
into
her
face
it
startled
me
to
see
how
she
has
failed
since
we
separated
i
shall
always
feel
grateful
to
her
that
she
was
not
dressed
as
a
bride
but
in
mournful
black
always
delicate
she
is
but
a
shadow
now
and
the
marriage
of
bragg
to
a
woman
who
is
but
a
puny
invalid
convinces
me
that
he
at
least
brought
it
about
to
revenge
himself
on
me
he
brought
on
the
quarrel
i
hope
he
is
satisfied
i
am
sure
only
mateel
s
weakness
is
to
blame
for
her
part
in
the
affair
for
marriage
in
her
condition
was
he
appeared
more
contented
and
easy
than
he
had
been
since
the
separation
like
a
man
who
had
accomplished
an
object
that
had
been
his
ambition
for
a
long
time
and
sat
down
again
quite
at
ease
when
he
saw
i
was
not
yet
ready
to
go
but
was
trying
to
dry
my
wet
garments
at
the
fire
i
even
thought
he
felt
in
good
spirits
for
he
straightened
himself
in
such
a
manner
as
to
be
comfortable
in
his
chair
and
beat
a
merry
tattoo
with
the
fingers
of
his
hand
which
rested
on
the
table
when
at
last
i
was
ready
to
start
to
town
with
him
i
had
never
thought
of
opposing
him
he
seemed
so
satisfied
with
the
course
he
had
marked
out
he
collected
a
few
articles
which
he
said
might
be
of
use
to
him
during
his
imprisonment
and
making
them
into
a
bundle
extinguished
the
light
and
followed
me
after
locking
the
door
and
handing
me
the
key
i
shall
never
see
the
place
again
of
course
nor
do
i
want
to
see
it
he
said
i
have
had
a
hard
time
of
it
here
from
first
to
last
and
for
all
my
work
i
get
nothing
but
a
ride
to
jail
to
be
locked
up
for
murder
a
splendid
fellow
i
that
could
work
to
no
better
purpose
i
thought
once
i
was
something
of
a
genius
and
rather
a
remarkable
fellow
but
like
all
other
fools
i
am
found
out
there
is
one
satisfaction
in
it
all
i
was
not
all
my
life
finding
out
my
mistake
i
am
now
but
i
have
known
greater
fools
than
i
am
at
seventy
i
am
glad
there
is
a
storm
i
like
to
be
out
in
on
the
way
he
kept
talking
in
a
manner
though
i
could
detect
a
mournful
strain
through
it
all
once
he
wondered
if
there
was
a
possibility
that
bragg
had
only
been
stunned
and
stopping
the
horses
wanted
to
go
back
to
see
but
after
thinking
about
it
awhile
he
said
no
danger
of
that
he
fell
out
of
my
grasp
as
limp
as
a
rag
i
held
him
at
arm
s
length
to
represent
a
gibbet
and
my
fingers
were
the
rope
for
the
brute
deserved
hanging
i
was
determined
that
he
should
die
a
dishonorable
death
as
well
as
i
when
he
is
found
there
will
be
marks
about
his
throat
as
though
he
had
been
hanged
his
tongue
will
protrude
from
his
mouth
and
his
eyes
start
from
their
sockets
as
they
say
men
look
who
have
been
hanged
my
only
regret
is
that
there
was
not
a
crowd
present
to
witness
his
dog
s
death
but
the
crowd
will
gather
around
him
and
be
horrified
at
his
several
times
he
described
with
pleasure
the
horrible
tragedy
in
the
woods
near
the
ford
hoarsely
laughing
as
he
told
how
bragg
had
writhed
and
struggled
in
his
grasp
and
once
he
asked
me
to
feel
the
bunch
of
muscle
on
the
strong
arm
which
had
righted
his
wrong
he
told
how
he
had
skulked
under
the
trees
waiting
for
their
approach
dodging
from
one
to
another
when
he
saw
them
in
the
road
how
he
had
hidden
behind
a
tree
until
they
were
beside
him
how
bragg
had
trembled
in
fear
when
he
felt
his
fingers
about
his
throat
how
fast
and
furious
the
vicious
horse
ran
crashing
through
the
underbrush
when
he
lashed
him
with
a
keen
hickory
withe
cut
for
the
purpose
and
how
he
almost
shouted
in
exultation
when
he
had
mateel
in
his
arms
he
recited
all
the
sickening
particulars
with
so
much
pleasure
that
i
feared
he
was
out
of
his
head
and
occupied
myself
in
mentally
making
notes
of
what
he
said
to
prove
that
he
was
not
responsible
for
his
act
at
another
time
he
cried
out
impatiently
why
don
t
you
applaud
what
i
have
done
you
have
not
said
a
word
all
evening
though
you
usually
cry
brave
jo
when
i
have
accomplished
a
purpose
but
you
seem
ashamed
of
me
oh
jo
i
replied
you
have
done
an
awful
thing
and
while
i
know
you
were
wronged
by
bragg
i
shudder
to
think
of
the
consequences
i
can
not
approve
of
this
act
jo
the
first
one
you
ever
did
at
which
i
could
not
cry
brave
jo
can
you
my
only
friend
wish
that
bragg
were
alive
again
he
answered
and
asleep
in
the
arms
of
mateel
with
me
alone
in
my
unhappy
home
surely
it
is
better
as
it
is
i
should
have
killed
myself
if
i
had
not
killed
bragg
and
you
must
say
you
can
not
help
it
that
he
deserved
death
as
much
as
i
he
deserved
it
more
for
he
is
the
cause
of
it
all
but
we
shall
both
give
up
our
lives
in
the
tragedy
i
took
no
more
from
him
than
the
law
will
take
from
me
and
although
he
is
to
blame
he
makes
no
greater
sacrifice
than
i
do
i
would
not
be
unjust
to
a
dog
i
have
not
been
unjust
to
him
if
there
can
be
pity
in
such
a
business
i
am
more
deserving
of
it
than
i
did
not
dare
to
express
my
real
sentiments
for
fear
of
encouraging
him
as
i
felt
he
had
fairly
expressed
it
when
he
said
he
could
do
nothing
else
than
murder
clinton
bragg
he
had
pursued
him
for
years
in
the
face
of
repeated
warnings
and
knowing
jo
s
desperation
his
action
in
inducing
mateel
to
take
the
step
at
a
time
when
she
was
weak
and
sick
could
have
been
nothing
else
than
wickedness
and
villainy
but
i
said
as
little
as
possible
during
the
drive
and
occupied
myself
in
devising
plans
for
his
escape
i
believed
that
bragg
s
unpopularity
would
be
of
benefit
in
the
trial
as
well
as
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
and
felt
certain
that
the
people
would
generally
be
in
sympathy
with
jo
when
we
arrived
in
the
town
it
was
as
still
as
the
country
we
had
just
left
and
rattling
loudly
at
the
sheriff
s
door
whose
residence
was
in
the
upper
part
of
the
jail
the
officer
soon
appeared
and
hearing
with
surprise
our
mission
he
locked
me
up
with
jo
at
my
own
request
as
i
desired
to
spend
the
night
with
him
a
few
moments
later
his
establishment
was
astir
and
in
half
an
hour
we
heard
a
posse
start
off
in
a
wagon
which
rattled
and
jolted
in
a
frightful
manner
to
bring
in
the
body
the
news
seemed
to
spread
rapidly
for
by
climbing
up
at
the
grated
window
i
saw
lights
in
several
directions
where
there
were
none
before
and
two
or
three
curious
people
had
already
appeared
in
the
yard
chapter
xxxii
the
twin
mounds
jail
there
had
never
been
a
murder
in
fairview
before
or
the
sight
of
a
man
who
had
died
a
violent
death
and
when
i
looked
out
of
the
grated
windows
a
few
hours
after
midday
for
we
both
slept
long
and
soundly
once
we
were
in
the
hard
and
cheerless
prison
beds
i
saw
that
the
news
had
spread
rapidly
for
the
town
was
already
full
of
people
curious
to
look
at
the
body
and
talk
of
the
tragedy
a
misty
rain
was
falling
a
continuation
of
the
storm
of
the
night
before
and
a
fog
spread
over
the
town
and
a
crowd
of
people
was
collected
in
front
of
the
jail
looking
curiously
up
at
the
windows
as
though
they
were
likely
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
culprit
when
one
of
the
number
went
up
to
the
his
place
in
the
mud
and
mire
in
front
of
the
jail
was
immediately
taken
by
some
one
who
came
from
the
and
i
supposed
that
the
dead
man
was
on
exhibition
there
i
scanned
the
upturned
faces
eagerly
for
looks
of
sympathy
for
jo
for
from
my
perch
i
could
look
into
them
without
being
seen
but
i
could
only
make
out
that
the
people
were
no
more
than
curious
occasionally
a
knot
of
men
gathered
about
one
of
their
number
while
he
expressed
an
opinion
and
though
i
could
not
hear
all
that
was
said
i
distinguished
enough
to
convince
me
that
there
was
no
regret
that
clinton
bragg
was
dead
late
in
the
afternoon
i
left
the
jail
by
the
entrance
used
by
the
sheriff
s
family
without
attracting
attention
and
went
into
the
where
the
body
was
on
exhibition
the
crowd
then
present
did
not
know
my
relation
to
jo
with
which
circumstance
i
was
pleased
and
i
looked
at
the
sight
as
any
other
idler
would
he
was
lying
in
the
middle
of
the
assembly
room
on
a
wide
plank
and
i
judged
the
coroner
s
jury
had
not
yet
assembled
for
it
was
still
in
the
condition
in
which
it
was
found
the
clothing
was
wet
from
lying
out
in
the
rain
and
i
was
certain
the
face
retained
the
expression
it
wore
when
i
had
passed
it
in
the
woods
for
it
was
horrible
to
look
at
a
livid
mark
ran
round
the
neck
showing
the
prints
of
fingers
the
tongue
protruded
from
the
mouth
and
the
eyes
started
from
their
sockets
precisely
as
would
have
been
the
case
had
clinton
bragg
been
hanged
and
altogether
the
sight
was
so
horrible
that
i
wondered
the
people
did
not
leave
it
in
terror
as
i
did
and
hurry
away
for
the
sight
made
me
sick
and
faint
but
the
people
continued
to
arrive
by
every
road
and
hurry
to
the
and
then
to
the
jail
to
look
up
curiously
at
the
windows
and
i
was
so
anxious
to
avoid
them
and
their
questions
that
after
a
few
minutes
with
martin
i
hurried
back
to
the
jail
and
was
again
admitted
where
i
found
jo
still
lying
about
in
his
apparently
very
comfortable
and
unconcerned
he
had
been
asleep
most
of
the
day
lounging
about
in
an
easy
way
precisely
as
i
have
since
known
men
to
do
who
spent
a
rainy
sunday
in
their
rooms
the
fierce
manner
which
had
distinguished
him
the
night
before
was
gone
and
in
its
place
was
a
sort
of
contentment
that
was
very
surprising
under
the
circumstances
he
had
but
little
to
say
making
no
inquiries
when
i
returned
as
to
where
i
had
been
and
a
short
time
after
the
lamps
were
brought
in
for
the
night
he
excused
himself
and
lying
down
on
his
cot
went
to
sleep
after
pleasantly
wishing
me
the
main
road
leading
toward
the
fairview
country
ran
past
the
outer
wall
of
the
jail
a
part
of
it
being
built
on
the
street
line
and
for
hours
i
heard
the
wagons
rattling
past
filled
with
crowds
of
men
returning
home
who
were
sitting
close
together
and
talking
in
low
tones
i
turned
down
the
light
and
climbing
up
to
the
single
window
which
looked
that
way
watched
them
and
tried
to
conjecture
what
the
verdict
would
be
but
their
curiosity
was
satisfied
and
they
were
now
only
intent
on
getting
home
and
repeating
the
story
to
others
who
would
in
turn
repeat
it
and
spread
the
news
through
the
woods
over
the
prairies
and
into
the
valleys
where
it
would
be
talked
of
and
wondered
at
and
be
voted
the
greatest
wonder
and
the
greatest
horror
that
ever
had
happened
the
coroner
and
a
jury
examined
the
body
the
next
day
and
when
it
was
learned
that
the
only
witness
of
the
affray
was
very
ill
it
was
agreed
to
adjourn
the
inquest
until
a
time
when
she
was
better
and
clinton
bragg
was
buried
in
a
grave
which
was
at
first
thought
to
be
temporary
but
it
proved
his
final
resting
place
as
the
remains
were
never
disturbed
at
jo
s
earnest
request
it
was
the
rule
anyway
i
believe
the
jailer
allowed
none
of
the
curious
to
see
him
and
after
he
was
locked
up
i
slept
there
every
night
fortunately
there
were
only
a
few
petty
offenders
in
the
jail
which
gave
us
an
entire
room
to
ourselves
and
bringing
in
furniture
and
beds
from
the
house
i
made
the
place
as
comfortable
as
possible
i
covered
the
walls
with
pictures
and
scarcely
a
day
passed
that
something
was
not
left
with
me
for
the
prisoner
the
sheriff
being
a
kindly
man
and
an
old
friend
of
ours
he
trusted
me
fully
so
that
had
i
been
disposed
i
could
have
easily
released
jo
or
furnished
him
means
of
escape
i
have
thought
that
the
sheriff
often
looked
at
me
in
surprise
that
i
did
not
take
advantage
of
the
liberty
given
me
and
get
him
away
and
he
often
went
into
the
cell
himself
to
talk
cheerfully
and
hopefully
in
many
of
the
packages
sent
me
were
drills
files
and
chisels
as
well
as
little
articles
of
comfort
and
in
almost
every
one
notes
written
in
heavy
hands
saying
that
no
harm
should
come
to
jo
but
we
handed
these
over
to
the
officer
in
return
for
his
kindness
who
guessed
with
us
who
sent
them
jo
seemed
to
be
more
contented
than
since
the
night
he
came
to
me
with
the
fatal
letter
and
spent
his
days
in
reading
and
lounging
about
i
thought
of
him
as
a
man
taking
a
rest
from
weary
work
and
as
one
who
thoroughly
enjoyed
his
ease
although
there
was
always
something
of
sadness
in
his
manner
he
was
more
like
himself
than
since
we
were
boys
and
we
spent
our
evenings
so
pleasantly
together
that
i
often
regretted
that
we
could
not
have
been
as
contented
as
we
were
without
the
commission
of
so
great
a
crime
before
he
went
to
prison
he
was
unable
to
sleep
at
night
but
now
he
retired
to
his
bed
early
and
slept
soundly
indeed
frequently
he
did
not
waken
until
the
middle
of
the
day
as
if
he
were
making
up
for
lost
time
and
often
spoke
thankfully
of
the
circumstance
that
he
could
enjoy
his
rest
again
as
he
did
when
a
boy
his
manner
was
so
gentle
that
i
thought
of
him
as
one
who
had
been
purified
by
great
suffering
and
if
i
had
loved
him
before
in
his
misfortune
and
danger
i
loved
him
a
thousand
times
more
after
he
had
gone
to
sleep
at
night
it
was
my
custom
to
toss
about
for
a
long
while
thinking
how
we
could
avoid
the
consequences
of
his
crime
and
after
a
troubled
night
get
up
early
in
the
morning
to
talk
over
and
over
again
with
those
i
had
employed
to
advise
me
for
jo
would
not
see
them
they
had
the
greatest
hope
and
took
unusual
interest
in
the
case
and
i
understood
their
policy
would
be
to
delay
a
trial
as
long
as
possible
when
opportunities
for
his
release
would
be
plentiful
enough
when
they
were
finally
forced
to
trial
they
could
at
least
secure
a
jury
that
would
fail
to
agree
and
as
no
one
had
seen
the
murder
they
hoped
to
be
able
to
establish
that
bragg
had
fallen
out
of
his
buggy
in
fright
when
jo
appeared
before
him
thus
permitting
the
wheels
to
run
across
his
neck
damon
barker
came
to
town
on
the
second
afternoon
following
the
murder
accompanied
by
big
adam
who
carried
an
immense
club
of
green
hickory
with
a
knot
on
the
end
as
though
he
expected
a
few
friends
would
attack
the
jail
and
release
the
prisoner
and
during
the
grave
interview
between
his
master
and
myself
he
kept
critically
examining
the
club
squinting
along
it
to
see
if
it
were
properly
proportioned
or
hefting
it
from
the
little
end
with
a
piece
of
chalk
he
marked
out
a
rude
figure
of
a
man
on
the
wall
and
after
writing
officer
over
it
in
great
capital
letters
he
stood
off
and
measured
the
distance
he
would
have
to
stand
from
it
in
order
to
do
effective
service
with
his
club
after
this
point
was
settled
he
calculated
by
experiment
where
a
man
of
the
size
of
the
figure
could
be
injured
most
by
striking
and
having
decided
that
the
head
was
the
place
he
made
an
x
with
the
chalk
at
the
point
selected
and
practised
until
he
could
hit
that
spot
every
time
he
did
this
with
so
much
seriousness
and
we
were
all
so
serious
that
day
that
we
paid
little
attention
to
him
when
barker
inquired
what
time
he
could
see
jo
and
i
answered
big
adam
said
in
a
voice
hoarser
than
usual
the
earlier
the
better
and
let
those
who
stand
in
the
way
look
out
for
their
heads
at
the
same
time
ominously
shaking
his
stick
of
hickory
when
informed
that
there
was
to
be
no
rescue
he
was
very
much
disappointed
and
was
silent
the
remainder
of
the
day
barker
was
never
a
man
of
words
and
he
expressed
no
opinion
about
the
matter
although
he
frequently
said
that
at
any
time
i
needed
him
i
had
only
to
say
the
word
no
matter
what
the
service
might
be
if
he
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
the
difference
between
jo
s
case
and
his
own
he
did
not
mention
it
and
held
his
peace
when
he
went
to
the
prison
to
see
jo
in
the
evening
i
thought
his
word
of
greeting
was
almost
a
sob
as
i
remember
him
on
the
night
he
came
to
claim
agnes
but
he
soon
recovered
himself
and
we
spent
the
evening
quite
pleasantly
big
adam
who
accompanied
us
spent
his
time
in
critically
examining
the
bars
at
the
windows
and
in
testing
their
strength
and
he
apparently
became
convinced
that
there
was
little
hope
in
that
direction
and
that
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
storm
it
from
the
outside
during
the
evening
he
wrote
a
note
and
asked
me
to
deliver
it
to
the
sheriff
and
after
he
went
away
i
looked
at
it
it
began
my
opinion
of
the
officer
followed
by
the
largest
number
of
blasphemous
words
i
have
ever
seen
collected
though
they
had
no
reference
to
each
other
every
one
being
complete
in
itself
as
an
expression
of
hate
there
were
also
a
great
many
vile
words
mixed
in
with
the
blasphemous
ones
and
at
the
bottom
he
signed
his
name
in
full
whereby
i
came
into
possession
of
the
fact
that
his
full
name
was
john
adam
casebolt
at
this
time
i
can
not
remember
how
long
it
was
before
bragg
s
father
came
but
within
an
hour
after
his
arrival
he
walked
quietly
into
the
office
and
after
waiting
my
pleasure
asked
me
to
tell
the
story
of
his
son
s
death
he
was
a
distressed
sort
of
a
man
as
though
he
had
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
in
his
life
and
i
honestly
tried
to
tell
the
circumstances
of
the
death
without
prejudice
of
bragg
s
systematic
persecution
of
jo
of
his
aimless
excursions
past
his
house
of
his
insolence
and
i
spoke
at
considerable
length
and
detailed
numerous
instances
when
i
knew
he
had
passed
the
mill
at
midnight
though
he
had
not
been
at
the
shepherds
i
told
him
of
his
son
s
renewed
attentions
after
the
separation
though
he
had
been
the
cause
of
it
and
i
expressed
the
opinion
that
he
had
brought
about
the
marriage
not
for
love
of
mateel
but
for
revenge
on
a
man
who
had
never
harmed
him
for
she
was
such
a
hopeless
invalid
that
marriage
with
any
one
was
the
merest
farce
he
made
no
replies
to
anything
i
said
but
occasionally
asked
a
question
to
make
a
point
clearer
and
when
i
had
finished
he
thanked
me
for
my
trouble
and
went
out
walking
past
the
jail
on
his
way
back
to
the
hotel
and
i
thought
he
peered
curiously
up
at
the
windows
as
if
he
were
anxious
to
see
jo
i
saw
him
a
great
deal
after
that
and
knew
that
he
was
in
consultation
with
an
attorney
but
he
talked
to
no
one
else
after
remaining
two
or
three
weeks
he
quietly
disappeared
and
it
was
learned
that
he
had
returned
home
leaving
his
case
in
the
hands
of
the
public
prosecutor
when
i
told
jo
of
my
strange
visitor
he
was
much
interested
and
referred
to
him
as
a
poor
fellow
saying
it
was
too
bad
that
he
had
travelled
so
far
on
such
a
sad
journey
he
inquired
carefully
after
his
personal
appearance
his
manners
and
i
almost
expected
that
he
would
ask
that
he
be
invited
to
see
him
it
was
my
custom
to
leave
the
prison
at
an
early
hour
in
the
morning
and
not
return
again
until
night
except
to
call
cheerfully
to
jo
as
i
passed
that
way
but
i
always
spent
my
evenings
with
him
and
greatly
enjoyed
them
because
we
were
never
disturbed
when
i
came
round
to
be
admitted
jo
was
always
waiting
for
me
and
one
evening
when
he
had
been
unusually
thoughtful
he
said
to
me
you
remember
i
told
you
once
of
the
haunted
cave
where
the
people
went
and
heard
the
sweetest
strains
of
music
but
which
was
soon
broken
into
by
a
hideous
tumult
i
often
visit
the
place
now
in
my
dreams
or
in
my
fancy
and
it
has
a
new
attraction
some
one
is
lost
there
and
there
is
no
hope
of
a
rescue
this
is
such
a
lonely
place
that
sometimes
when
i
lie
here
through
the
day
waiting
for
you
i
visit
the
place
when
i
am
awake
i
am
very
familiar
with
the
rugged
path
which
leads
through
the
dark
ravine
to
its
mouth
and
when
the
day
is
bad
i
never
fail
to
go
although
it
is
horrible
there
is
a
certain
fascination
about
it
i
am
unable
to
resist
when
last
i
visited
it
i
did
not
hear
the
music
at
all
but
instead
some
one
crying
which
was
drowned
by
the
usual
tumult
when
this
had
subsided
i
heard
the
same
voice
distinctly
crying
help
help
i
am
lost
which
so
excited
me
that
i
awoke
since
then
every
time
i
fall
asleep
i
visit
the
cave
and
after
sitting
a
long
while
in
silence
suddenly
i
hear
the
same
agonizing
cry
help
help
i
am
then
come
such
pitiful
sobs
that
i
awake
again
i
have
come
to
regard
the
man
lost
in
the
cave
as
myself
and
while
waiting
to
hear
him
call
i
have
tried
to
invent
a
plan
for
his
rescue
and
wondered
if
you
and
barker
would
not
help
me
perhaps
this
is
a
premonition
of
my
future
it
may
be
that
after
i
am
dead
it
will
be
my
punishment
to
wander
in
a
dark
and
gloomy
place
unable
to
die
but
forever
calling
help
help
i
am
i
have
thought
too
that
it
is
possible
when
i
am
sick
and
tired
from
wandering
about
and
calling
for
help
always
expecting
that
rescue
is
near
at
hand
that
suddenly
a
light
so
great
as
to
dazzle
my
poor
eyes
will
appear
that
i
shall
be
permitted
to
see
a
beautiful
place
with
running
streams
and
shady
paths
under
the
trees
and
that
i
shall
realize
that
it
is
the
eternal
city
as
i
look
mateel
and
bragg
attired
in
raiment
befitting
their
new
condition
will
appear
happy
in
their
perfected
love
my
imprisonment
in
that
awful
place
will
have
unmanned
me
so
much
that
i
shall
cry
to
them
help
help
i
am
lost
but
they
will
not
be
permitted
to
hear
and
when
i
stagger
toward
the
blessed
light
the
figures
will
disappear
and
i
shall
fall
on
my
face
in
the
he
always
talked
of
the
cave
and
the
vision
in
such
a
mournful
hopeless
way
that
it
greatly
affected
me
but
he
would
soon
rally
and
become
cheerful
again
as
though
i
had
a
right
to
expect
that
of
him
in
return
for
my
attention
he
talked
in
this
strain
a
great
deal
and
seemed
to
take
more
interest
in
it
than
in
anything
else
or
it
may
have
been
a
fascination
which
he
could
not
avoid
every
evening
when
i
came
in
he
had
a
new
experience
with
the
cave
or
the
vision
to
relate
and
i
shudder
yet
when
i
remember
his
descriptions
of
the
man
who
was
always
wandering
in
the
dark
and
awful
place
his
fancy
had
created
and
who
was
always
calling
for
help
which
never
came
although
he
was
as
much
a
mystery
to
me
as
ever
i
never
looked
at
him
that
i
could
not
see
his
love
for
me
i
did
no
more
for
him
than
anyone
would
have
done
under
the
same
circumstances
but
he
talked
about
it
a
great
deal
and
expressed
his
gratitude
that
he
had
one
friend
in
the
world
in
spite
of
his
disgrace
and
crime
very
often
i
assured
him
of
the
pleasure
it
gave
me
to
be
of
service
to
him
and
the
keen
regrets
i
felt
that
i
could
not
do
more
and
at
these
times
he
turned
his
head
away
and
i
believed
that
tears
were
in
his
eyes
i
can
never
explain
the
sympathy
and
affection
i
felt
for
him
while
he
was
in
prison
for
knowing
him
as
i
did
i
could
not
help
feeling
that
he
was
justified
and
when
i
saw
that
he
took
no
interest
in
the
plans
i
proposed
for
his
escaping
the
consequences
hope
died
within
me
and
i
felt
that
when
the
time
came
he
would
acknowledge
his
guilt
and
ask
me
as
his
last
request
to
attend
him
on
the
scaffold
further
than
his
remark
that
he
would
give
his
own
life
for
the
one
he
had
taken
he
but
barely
mentioned
the
tragedy
in
any
way
and
seemed
only
to
be
waiting
to
keep
his
oath
inasmuch
as
the
coroner
s
jury
had
not
yet
assembled
to
listen
to
evidence
in
the
case
the
only
witness
being
too
ill
to
attend
i
could
not
conjecture
what
course
he
would
adopt
when
called
upon
to
express
himself
and
i
was
afraid
to
ask
him
he
would
not
see
the
attorneys
i
had
selected
to
advise
me
saying
in
excuse
that
he
was
not
ready
or
that
whatever
i
did
represented
him
so
that
i
seemed
to
be
the
culprit
rather
than
jo
for
i
worried
more
about
it
and
was
oftener
in
despair
only
once
during
his
confinement
did
he
refer
to
the
causes
leading
to
the
tragedy
in
the
woods
i
had
been
reading
to
him
until
far
into
the
night
with
the
light
between
us
as
we
lay
on
the
rough
prison
cots
when
he
interrupted
me
by
inquiring
are
you
quite
sure
that
you
fully
forgive
me
for
my
desperate
crime
yes
i
might
have
been
a
credit
to
you
instead
of
a
disgrace
had
i
acted
differently
he
said
turning
on
his
side
to
look
at
me
when
you
were
reading
just
now
i
thought
of
the
afternoon
in
fairview
when
we
went
out
to
the
hayloft
to
talk
of
our
future
after
it
was
announced
that
i
was
to
go
to
damon
barker
s
to
live
and
i
thought
that
while
we
have
turned
out
very
much
as
we
hoped
we
should
you
were
brave
and
patient
in
your
sorrow
while
i
was
utterly
cast
down
by
mine
and
ruined
do
you
forgive
me
for
that
yes
jo
everything
i
love
you
so
much
that
i
can
not
think
of
your
he
turned
on
his
back
again
and
remained
quiet
so
long
that
i
too
thought
of
the
sunday
afternoon
in
fairview
and
of
what
he
had
said
jo
was
evidently
thinking
of
the
same
thing
for
at
last
he
continued
i
remember
of
your
mother
saying
to
me
once
that
she
believed
you
and
i
would
grow
up
into
brave
and
honorable
men
men
who
would
love
their
wives
and
children
instead
of
treating
them
as
they
were
treated
in
fairview
and
i
feel
very
guilty
now
that
i
realize
that
she
was
mistaken
in
her
opinion
of
me
it
would
have
been
genuine
bravery
had
i
conquered
my
horror
of
the
letter
my
hate
for
clinton
bragg
and
made
mateel
love
me
in
spite
of
everything
but
i
did
not
know
what
the
word
meant
then
though
i
do
now
and
your
mother
probably
meant
something
like
that
my
boyhood
was
so
wretched
that
i
expected
relief
from
wretchedness
when
i
was
married
but
perhaps
i
should
have
known
that
unhappiness
attends
every
condition
in
life
and
that
bravery
and
nobility
consists
in
forgiving
and
forgetting
together
with
gentleness
and
capacity
my
life
has
been
one
long
mistake
i
should
think
you
would
find
it
hard
to
forgive
that
after
expecting
so
much
of
no
jo
not
at
all
hard
if
you
are
entitled
to
charity
from
me
i
gave
it
without
knowing
it
for
i
only
think
of
you
to
regret
that
a
man
so
worthy
has
been
so
unfortunate
i
never
reproached
you
in
my
although
i
believe
you
forgive
me
fully
he
continued
i
can
not
forgive
myself
though
i
confess
my
weakness
and
say
that
i
always
did
the
best
i
could
i
conquered
everything
except
shame
over
the
contents
of
the
letter
and
hate
at
the
sight
of
bragg
these
dragged
me
down
as
discontent
dragged
john
westlock
down
perhaps
any
man
could
be
ruined
if
attacked
at
the
right
wiser
men
than
you
jo
are
of
that
opinion
and
i
regarded
it
as
the
most
eloquent
defence
he
had
ever
made
those
who
believe
in
their
own
strength
have
great
charity
for
themselves
and
none
at
all
for
others
but
those
of
us
who
are
more
candid
and
learned
in
the
world
s
affairs
acknowledge
our
own
weakness
in
admitting
the
weakness
of
others
i
am
satisfied
now
that
i
made
a
mistake
in
thinking
of
love
as
it
should
be
not
as
it
really
is
and
i
unwisely
built
on
that
foundation
but
i
blame
no
one
for
it
a
man
who
is
ignorant
should
submit
to
the
penalties
without
complaint
but
i
shall
always
think
that
i
should
have
been
very
contented
had
it
turned
out
as
i
expected
i
shall
always
justify
myself
with
the
belief
that
had
mateel
brought
as
much
enthusiasm
into
our
marriage
contract
as
i
did
we
should
have
been
of
great
use
to
each
other
i
hope
you
will
not
think
hard
of
me
if
i
say
that
she
had
the
experience
which
i
should
have
had
while
i
had
the
innocence
and
faith
in
marriage
which
a
wife
should
he
had
little
to
say
after
that
and
tossed
about
uneasily
in
his
bed
after
i
put
out
the
light
which
was
unusual
for
i
had
frequently
remarked
with
surprise
that
he
slept
well
in
the
jail
and
seemed
greatly
refreshed
by
it
perhaps
he
had
never
permitted
himself
to
think
of
his
wife
until
that
evening
since
he
had
struggled
with
bragg
in
the
woods
and
the
indiscretion
had
brought
on
his
old
trouble
for
if
i
dozed
off
and
wakened
again
i
found
him
pacing
up
and
down
the
floor
as
he
had
done
so
many
nights
in
the
house
at
the
mill
when
he
lived
alone
in
it
as
i
watched
him
i
tried
to
compute
the
number
of
weary
miles
he
had
travelled
in
this
manner
since
the
separation
up
and
down
from
the
right
to
the
left
carrying
his
aching
and
troubled
head
which
refused
him
peace
night
and
day
thinking
thinking
thinking
up
and
down
from
the
right
to
the
left
so
the
long
road
was
travelled
growing
more
painful
and
difficult
every
day
i
followed
the
road
he
had
been
travelling
to
where
it
ended
and
encountered
a
jail
in
which
jo
erring
s
hope
and
ambition
the
pride
and
comfort
of
my
boyhood
were
locked
up
with
my
old
friend
changed
but
little
pacing
wearily
up
and
down
to
see
that
there
was
no
escape
oh
jo
my
dearest
friend
is
there
nothing
i
can
do
to
lighten
your
sorrow
must
i
watch
you
travelling
a
road
which
grows
more
suggestive
of
the
damp
of
graves
with
every
day
s
journey
without
putting
out
a
hand
to
help
you
will
you
continue
to
put
me
off
with
no
other
reply
than
tears
when
i
offer
to
help
you
until
we
enter
the
churchyard
together
and
i
come
out
alone
getting
up
from
my
bed
i
joined
him
in
the
walk
putting
my
arm
through
his
and
as
we
paced
up
and
down
encountering
a
cruel
stone
wall
at
every
turn
i
bitterly
accused
myself
that
i
had
not
been
with
him
more
during
his
trouble
but
when
i
mentioned
it
i
knew
that
he
believed
i
had
done
all
i
could
though
he
did
not
speak
a
word
and
i
could
not
see
his
face
i
knew
it
though
i
did
not
know
why
up
and
down
from
the
right
to
the
left
i
thought
half
the
night
had
passed
before
he
returned
to
his
bed
and
even
then
i
was
convinced
that
he
ceased
walking
more
out
of
consideration
for
me
than
because
he
was
tired
when
the
first
rays
of
morning
light
came
straggling
into
the
dismal
place
i
wakened
again
but
jo
was
not
in
bed
he
had
climbed
up
to
the
grated
window
and
was
looking
out
in
the
direction
of
fairview
motionless
as
a
statue
what
was
in
his
mind
will
never
be
known
but
i
have
always
believed
that
it
was
a
longing
to
see
his
wife
and
the
house
at
the
mill
i
fell
into
a
light
sleep
again
and
when
it
was
broad
daylight
he
was
still
looking
longingly
toward
fairview
the
little
world
in
which
his
simple
life
had
been
passed
where
he
had
created
and
destroyed
and
where
he
hoped
to
find
rest
at
last
in
the
shadow
of
the
old
church
chapter
xxxiii
reaping
the
whirlwind
afraid
to
trust
my
own
judgment
with
reference
to
jo
whom
i
always
thought
of
now
as
standing
in
the
shadow
of
a
scaffold
about
four
weeks
after
he
went
to
jail
i
resolved
to
visit
the
mill
on
bull
river
and
solicit
damon
barker
s
advice
which
i
knew
would
be
friendly
and
sensible
he
was
a
man
of
excellent
judgment
and
though
he
had
been
to
twin
mounds
but
once
since
the
trouble
i
knew
he
was
ready
at
any
time
to
aid
jo
as
he
had
said
no
difference
what
necessity
might
require
and
that
he
was
only
waiting
a
summons
trusting
to
me
to
bring
it
i
felt
sure
that
jo
s
intention
was
to
admit
his
guilt
when
called
upon
and
suffer
the
penalty
and
i
was
not
satisfied
that
i
had
done
enough
to
dissuade
him
from
the
intention
barker
had
great
influence
with
him
and
for
this
reason
i
sought
his
counsel
and
advice
i
intended
to
start
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
hoping
to
reach
the
mill
by
nightfall
and
return
early
the
next
day
and
an
hour
before
my
departure
i
went
into
the
jail
to
announce
to
jo
that
i
would
be
away
during
the
night
it
was
the
first
night
i
had
been
out
of
his
company
since
his
confinement
in
the
prison
and
i
was
therefore
surprised
that
he
seemed
rather
pleased
with
the
prospect
though
he
apologized
for
it
by
saying
that
i
had
been
there
so
long
that
i
would
enjoy
a
night
out
he
seemed
to
know
that
i
was
going
to
barker
s
to
talk
about
him
for
he
asked
me
to
thank
him
and
agnes
for
any
good
they
might
find
it
in
their
hearts
to
say
of
him
and
he
said
over
and
over
again
how
kind
we
all
were
and
how
much
trouble
we
had
been
to
on
his
account
you
must
not
go
away
feeling
down
at
heart
or
ill
at
ease
but
cheerful
he
said
when
i
confessed
that
i
was
going
to
barker
s
in
his
behalf
i
will
tell
you
something
that
will
please
you
i
have
studied
over
this
matter
a
great
deal
during
the
past
few
weeks
and
have
come
to
a
conclusion
that
will
relieve
us
all
i
will
only
say
now
that
it
will
end
all
confusion
and
worry
and
that
it
is
the
very
best
thing
that
can
be
done
i
know
that
you
have
confidence
in
my
judgment
and
will
be
content
to
wait
until
you
return
when
you
shall
know
all
it
is
not
a
plan
that
will
cause
you
more
trouble
but
one
that
will
be
a
relief
to
you
therefore
be
as
happy
as
you
can
while
away
and
carry
my
kindest
wishes
to
agnes
and
her
father
tell
them
that
i
am
well
and
that
in
a
little
while
we
shall
be
through
worrying
over
this
matter
for
i
have
hit
upon
a
plan
to
relieve
us
of
it
it
is
sure
to
work
tell
them
and
that
they
need
not
fear
as
to
that
i
may
say
it
is
the
only
thing
that
can
be
done
which
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
for
it
is
sometimes
hard
to
hit
upon
the
right
plan
but
after
a
great
deal
of
thought
i
have
it
you
feel
better
now
do
you
not
i
answered
him
that
i
did
which
was
the
case
for
i
believed
that
while
i
was
away
during
the
day
he
was
thinking
and
hoped
that
he
had
hit
upon
something
that
would
meet
with
the
approval
of
all
his
friends
probably
it
was
an
escape
and
a
life
in
some
distant
country
where
i
would
join
him
in
course
of
time
or
perhaps
a
plea
of
backed
by
circumstances
of
which
i
knew
nothing
but
at
any
rate
i
was
sure
the
plan
was
a
good
one
for
jo
did
not
often
make
mistakes
in
such
matters
and
i
felt
a
relief
of
which
i
was
greatly
in
need
i
determined
at
once
to
bring
barker
back
with
me
to
hear
the
plan
and
aid
in
its
execution
you
look
happier
he
said
taking
both
my
hands
in
his
own
than
i
have
seen
you
in
a
long
while
i
am
very
glad
of
that
and
i
hope
i
too
look
pleasant
for
i
am
sure
the
plan
is
a
good
one
do
i
not
look
much
as
i
did
when
we
were
happy
boys
together
when
i
was
your
good
friend
and
loved
you
more
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
look
at
me
and
i
did
as
he
requested
and
saw
that
there
was
the
old
cheerfulness
in
his
smile
as
there
had
been
the
old
tenderness
in
his
voice
a
little
older
and
a
little
paler
i
replied
but
certainly
you
look
more
natural
to
me
this
moment
than
you
have
for
four
years
and
you
look
more
like
my
old
friend
too
for
when
we
were
boys
and
you
told
me
of
your
friendship
you
were
so
earnest
and
feeling
that
tears
came
into
your
eyes
there
are
tears
in
your
eyes
he
did
not
brush
them
away
as
i
expected
he
would
but
let
them
roll
down
his
cheeks
and
fall
to
the
floor
i
did
not
know
there
were
tears
in
my
eyes
until
you
spoke
he
said
but
they
are
only
tears
of
gratitude
that
i
am
permitted
to
have
one
friend
like
he
still
held
both
my
hands
and
looked
at
me
in
such
a
way
that
i
thought
he
was
thinking
he
had
a
bold
piece
of
work
to
demand
of
me
to
effect
his
release
a
part
of
his
plan
and
that
i
would
undertake
it
without
hesitating
no
matter
what
the
risk
as
i
would
have
done
it
is
as
much
as
a
man
ought
to
expect
during
his
life
to
realize
a
friendship
as
pure
and
unselfish
as
yours
has
always
been
for
me
and
i
want
to
say
while
i
am
looking
in
your
eyes
please
do
not
say
it
is
nothing
for
it
is
a
great
deal
that
you
have
been
the
one
solace
of
a
very
unhappy
man
i
may
not
have
deserved
it
but
it
has
been
given
to
me
and
i
love
you
as
a
bad
man
ought
to
love
a
good
wife
who
has
been
faithful
to
him
through
all
his
misdeeds
i
am
very
wicked
and
have
a
wicked
heart
but
you
can
have
it
to
say
that
you
had
all
the
love
there
was
in
one
man
s
life
all
the
tenderness
in
my
rough
nature
has
been
given
to
you
and
no
one
else
has
ever
found
welcome
in
my
heart
no
one
not
even
my
father
or
mother
divided
my
affection
for
you
it
is
not
much
but
it
is
all
i
i
assured
him
it
was
a
great
deal
and
that
it
had
been
a
comfort
to
me
from
the
day
i
began
to
remember
you
are
the
only
one
who
was
ever
thoughtful
or
kind
to
me
though
i
have
always
coveted
such
attention
he
added
i
suppose
i
deserved
all
the
neglect
i
have
received
i
hope
not
but
i
can
not
think
anything
else
and
you
brought
the
only
ray
of
genuine
sunshine
that
ever
found
its
way
into
my
desolate
heart
without
you
i
should
have
been
friendless
all
my
life
i
hope
i
could
have
made
myself
worthy
of
friends
had
they
come
in
my
way
but
they
never
came
and
i
have
had
no
other
object
in
life
than
to
deserve
your
good
opinion
i
am
afraid
i
can
never
repay
you
but
i
am
very
he
was
very
earnest
but
not
sad
and
i
believed
he
was
telling
me
this
because
when
i
came
back
there
would
be
active
work
to
do
and
a
long
separation
and
when
i
turned
again
to
call
the
keeper
to
release
me
jo
said
for
me
to
remember
that
it
was
all
for
the
best
all
for
the
best
i
am
certain
i
replied
and
do
i
look
cheerful
again
as
though
i
felt
that
what
i
say
is
true
i
have
not
seen
a
pleasant
smile
on
your
face
before
in
a
long
while
i
said
and
i
feel
greatly
encouraged
i
hope
my
recollection
of
you
will
always
be
as
you
appear
there
was
a
mingled
look
of
bravery
and
tenderness
in
his
face
which
made
me
very
fond
of
him
i
am
sure
the
plan
is
a
good
one
for
it
has
made
us
both
happier
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
he
said
putting
his
hand
through
the
little
wicket
to
bid
me
when
i
was
finally
in
the
corridor
and
so
it
will
turn
out
but
even
if
it
did
not
meet
your
approval
at
first
you
would
not
upbraid
me
or
think
less
of
me
than
you
do
now
no
jo
i
answered
for
i
thought
that
if
ever
a
man
was
justified
in
breaking
jail
and
hiding
away
in
a
place
where
he
could
make
amends
for
his
mistakes
he
was
i
could
not
think
less
of
you
than
i
do
for
even
if
my
judgment
should
not
accord
with
yours
i
should
believe
it
to
be
my
own
fault
and
that
i
should
finally
discover
that
you
were
right
i
have
so
much
confidence
in
you
that
i
am
sure
that
the
plan
is
a
good
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
he
repeated
and
so
it
will
turn
out
how
his
hand
trembled
in
mine
i
thought
it
was
joy
over
the
prospect
of
once
more
being
free
and
i
had
so
much
confidence
in
the
friendship
of
the
sheriff
who
stood
beside
me
that
i
had
a
mind
to
tell
him
that
jo
had
at
last
consented
to
take
advantage
of
the
opportunities
he
delighted
to
give
him
and
escape
i
was
so
pleased
with
it
all
that
i
thought
i
must
talk
to
some
one
but
thinking
better
of
it
i
waved
my
hand
gayly
to
the
prisoner
and
passing
out
at
the
front
door
was
soon
on
my
way
to
fairview
as
i
drove
rapidly
along
the
familiar
road
i
had
a
hundred
pleasant
conjectures
of
the
morrow
when
jo
would
reveal
to
me
the
plan
by
which
he
was
to
be
free
the
one
i
fixed
upon
and
took
most
pleasure
in
was
an
escape
to
some
distant
country
where
i
would
follow
him
in
a
few
months
and
where
we
should
live
happily
together
the
remainder
of
our
lives
there
was
a
rough
rugged
country
beyond
ours
where
hunted
men
went
and
where
no
questions
were
asked
and
i
thought
of
our
living
together
in
a
cabin
on
a
mountain
side
companions
in
toil
and
peace
i
thought
this
plan
might
make
it
necessary
for
me
to
give
up
agnes
for
a
while
but
her
patience
i
knew
was
great
and
she
would
think
of
me
all
the
more
kindly
for
the
sacrifice
i
had
made
for
love
of
jo
he
had
said
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
that
surely
meant
a
rapid
flight
to
the
mountains
for
that
was
the
speedy
and
the
certain
way
out
of
the
difficulty
and
i
almost
rejoiced
in
it
for
i
determined
to
go
with
him
at
once
and
leave
my
affairs
to
be
settled
up
by
barker
who
alone
should
know
of
my
whereabouts
i
even
regarded
it
as
a
prospect
of
a
happy
relief
from
my
weary
work
and
thought
that
while
jo
would
say
it
was
best
i
should
remain
and
settle
our
joint
affairs
in
person
i
stoutly
decided
to
go
with
him
and
even
planned
how
to
get
ready
money
for
the
purpose
these
thoughts
so
occupied
my
mind
that
i
was
surprised
when
i
came
in
the
vicinity
of
the
mill
and
also
by
the
circumstance
that
it
was
growing
dark
for
i
had
taken
no
note
of
time
as
was
usually
the
case
at
that
season
of
the
year
the
mill
was
in
operation
when
i
arrived
a
half
hour
after
dark
and
hoping
to
find
agnes
alone
in
the
house
i
dismounted
at
the
side
gate
and
went
in
the
evening
being
pleasant
the
front
door
was
wide
open
and
stepping
on
the
inside
i
was
debating
whether
they
were
not
all
down
at
the
mill
when
agnes
came
out
suddenly
from
the
room
and
stood
beside
me
it
may
have
been
surprise
at
her
sudden
appearance
but
without
thinking
what
i
did
i
put
my
arms
about
her
and
kissed
her
i
have
been
in
so
much
trouble
of
late
i
said
still
holding
her
in
my
arms
and
felt
your
absence
so
keenly
that
i
could
not
resist
the
temptation
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
i
came
on
an
important
errand
but
my
distress
has
made
me
brave
and
i
can
not
help
showing
how
much
i
love
she
was
perfectly
still
looking
into
my
eyes
and
i
thought
that
though
it
was
the
same
sweet
face
it
was
different
from
what
it
had
ever
been
before
no
longer
the
face
of
my
patient
friend
but
the
face
of
my
sweetheart
a
picture
of
a
woman
s
perfect
love
it
has
been
so
often
necessary
for
you
to
forgive
me
i
always
made
so
many
mistakes
while
you
were
so
womanly
that
you
will
forgive
me
once
more
for
declaring
though
i
came
on
an
errand
in
poor
jo
s
behalf
that
i
have
loved
you
as
man
and
boy
for
eight
years
that
you
have
been
so
necessary
to
me
that
i
could
not
have
lived
but
for
the
hope
your
friendship
gave
me
i
have
never
been
able
to
show
you
how
dear
you
have
been
to
me
i
was
always
so
awkward
but
i
show
you
my
heart
now
and
declare
what
i
may
not
have
acted
that
i
have
never
had
any
other
wish
to
live
than
that
i
might
win
she
attempted
to
speak
but
i
would
not
permit
it
for
i
had
not
yet
finished
when
i
was
a
boy
it
was
my
hope
of
the
future
to
become
a
worthy
man
and
prepare
a
home
for
homeless
agnes
who
was
always
my
friend
no
matter
how
undeserving
i
was
in
all
my
hard
life
which
has
seemed
like
a
night
you
have
been
the
kindly
star
which
was
always
shining
and
bidding
me
hope
when
your
father
came
back
to
you
i
feared
that
your
happiness
was
so
great
that
i
could
never
again
add
to
it
but
even
if
this
is
so
i
can
no
longer
keep
my
secret
it
has
been
crying
out
at
its
confinement
for
years
and
i
must
tell
you
that
i
love
she
remained
silent
and
motionless
so
long
that
i
began
to
fear
that
what
i
had
said
without
believing
was
really
true
that
she
was
so
happy
with
her
father
that
she
would
never
leave
him
and
that
she
was
framing
an
answer
that
would
not
offend
me
i
have
always
known
she
said
at
last
that
you
loved
me
and
have
always
believed
that
some
time
you
would
come
to
me
and
declare
it
just
as
you
have
it
was
my
only
wish
ungratified
for
nothing
was
lacking
besides
that
to
complete
my
i
pressed
her
closer
to
me
and
for
the
first
time
in
a
great
many
months
the
tears
came
into
my
eyes
until
i
could
not
see
her
during
all
the
trouble
at
jo
s
my
concern
found
no
relief
but
her
love
for
me
made
me
realize
how
wretched
i
had
been
and
in
spite
of
all
i
could
do
the
tears
came
into
my
eyes
i
tried
to
apologize
for
the
weakness
but
she
wiped
the
tears
away
so
tenderly
that
i
thought
certainly
there
was
never
such
a
loving
touch
as
hers
and
blessed
her
for
the
hundredth
time
i
led
her
into
the
adjoining
room
and
when
we
sat
down
by
the
window
and
opened
the
shutters
i
saw
by
the
moonlight
which
came
streaming
in
that
she
was
dressed
in
white
and
that
she
so
much
resembled
a
pretty
bride
that
i
could
not
help
holding
her
off
from
me
and
admiring
her
you
remember
i
used
to
tell
you
agnes
said
that
some
day
my
ship
would
come
in
after
a
stormy
voyage
and
bring
me
many
rich
gifts
i
think
you
always
thought
i
referred
to
my
i
acknowledged
that
i
did
but
really
i
referred
to
your
coming
to
me
and
telling
me
as
i
believed
you
would
that
you
loved
me
i
never
had
a
hope
that
my
father
was
alive
and
as
i
told
you
about
my
ship
sailing
toward
me
when
you
were
but
a
boy
i
was
but
a
girl
when
i
first
came
to
fairview
i
must
have
referred
to
you
as
i
certainly
she
was
sitting
near
an
open
piano
and
lightly
touching
the
keys
i
recognized
the
air
of
an
old
love
song
she
had
taught
me
the
first
year
of
our
acquaintance
in
flattering
dreams
i
dreamed
thee
we
were
both
so
wretched
during
the
first
years
of
our
acquaintance
agnes
said
that
i
sometimes
feared
we
must
always
remain
apart
but
i
never
for
a
moment
thought
you
did
not
love
me
i
always
knew
it
and
was
constantly
trying
to
deserve
it
if
i
heard
of
you
in
a
creditable
connection
i
was
pleased
and
strived
harder
than
ever
and
there
never
was
a
doubt
but
that
you
would
come
to
me
some
time
i
did
not
know
when
and
tell
me
what
you
have
told
me
i
have
nothing
to
wish
for
now
except
that
i
may
be
long
spared
to
show
you
how
much
i
love
you
for
we
must
have
been
very
happy
during
the
hour
or
more
we
sat
by
the
window
for
during
that
time
i
did
not
once
think
of
jo
nor
should
i
have
thought
of
him
for
a
much
longer
time
had
not
barker
s
step
on
the
walk
aroused
me
we
both
went
out
to
meet
him
he
had
finished
his
work
and
was
coming
to
the
house
for
the
night
and
frightened
at
my
neglect
i
hurriedly
ran
over
what
i
came
to
say
he
looked
at
me
in
grave
surprise
and
leading
me
back
to
the
room
asked
me
to
repeat
what
i
had
said
i
then
told
them
both
substantially
what
jo
had
said
to
me
on
my
leaving
and
that
i
had
come
for
him
to
go
back
with
me
for
i
was
sure
that
in
this
important
emergency
his
cool
judgment
would
be
valuable
agnes
was
very
much
pleased
but
barker
was
as
grave
as
usual
and
only
said
that
he
would
return
with
me
at
once
if
i
thought
it
necessary
it
was
agreed
that
before
we
started
we
should
refresh
ourselves
with
food
and
while
agnes
was
preparing
it
how
gay
she
was
i
think
even
her
father
must
have
noticed
it
he
again
inquired
very
particularly
as
to
what
jo
had
said
and
when
i
had
finished
he
went
out
and
sat
on
the
porch
alone
until
agnes
called
him
i
believed
he
was
thinking
that
no
matter
what
the
plan
was
he
would
not
falter
in
his
part
in
it
and
i
was
so
much
encouraged
that
i
went
out
to
tell
agnes
that
within
a
week
our
dear
friend
jo
would
be
free
during
the
drive
back
to
town
barker
was
very
grave
saying
but
little
and
in
consequence
i
drove
rapidly
as
we
passed
the
jail
i
saw
that
all
the
lights
were
out
and
supposing
that
jo
was
asleep
we
went
on
to
the
house
to
spend
the
night
and
in
a
very
little
while
i
was
fast
asleep
chapter
xxxiv
the
grave
by
the
path
i
have
heard
that
dreams
go
by
contraries
whether
they
do
or
not
jo
was
in
my
mind
a
great
deal
that
night
and
he
was
once
more
free
to
go
where
he
pleased
without
the
restraint
of
cruel
stone
walls
and
iron
doors
i
thought
of
him
as
i
had
seen
him
during
the
first
year
of
his
apprenticeship
at
damon
barker
s
when
he
was
full
of
hope
for
the
future
and
tender
as
a
child
because
of
his
love
for
mateel
and
we
were
happy
together
again
without
knowledge
of
the
unhappiness
in
both
our
lives
i
slept
until
rather
a
late
hour
and
was
awakened
by
the
sheriff
from
the
jail
who
came
up
to
my
bed
in
great
excitement
holding
a
letter
in
his
hand
i
did
not
know
how
he
got
into
the
room
but
supposed
barker
was
up
before
me
and
had
admitted
him
the
letter
was
addressed
to
me
and
hurriedly
opening
it
while
yet
in
bed
i
read
my
dear
old
friend
when
this
shall
fall
into
your
hands
the
plan
i
spoke
to
you
about
will
have
been
carried
into
effect
and
i
shall
be
dead
after
several
months
of
careful
consideration
for
i
thought
about
it
long
before
bragg
was
killed
i
determined
to
do
myself
a
kindness
by
taking
my
own
life
and
i
write
this
an
hour
before
i
carry
that
resolution
into
effect
to
a
friend
who
has
been
as
true
as
you
have
been
it
is
only
necessary
for
me
to
say
that
i
have
fully
justified
myself
in
this
course
next
to
the
horror
i
have
of
escaping
from
this
jail
i
have
a
horror
of
a
public
execution
which
would
certainly
befall
me
for
i
am
guilty
and
take
so
much
pleasure
in
my
guilt
that
i
can
not
deny
it
since
the
first
thought
of
taking
my
own
life
came
into
my
mind
it
has
never
been
a
horrible
one
and
when
i
first
knew
that
bragg
was
to
marry
mateel
i
resolved
to
kill
him
and
then
myself
the
first
part
of
the
resolve
i
carried
out
as
i
intended
the
second
will
have
been
accomplished
when
this
falls
into
your
hands
as
i
wrote
just
now
i
laid
down
my
pen
to
consider
whether
i
had
any
regrets
in
leaving
the
world
i
found
there
was
one
your
sorrow
when
you
read
this
but
beyond
that
nothing
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
care
to
live
and
there
are
a
great
many
why
i
wish
to
die
the
principal
one
being
oblivion
of
my
disgrace
and
crime
whether
the
religion
we
were
taught
is
true
or
not
i
shall
probably
peacefully
sleep
a
long
time
before
i
am
judged
and
i
am
almost
willing
to
submit
to
a
future
of
torture
for
a
period
of
forgetfulness
for
my
trouble
comes
to
me
in
my
sleep
of
late
and
i
have
no
rest
my
head
is
such
a
trouble
to
me
now
that
i
have
feared
that
it
will
not
die
with
my
body
but
after
that
i
am
buried
it
will
still
ache
and
toss
about
if
i
have
a
hope
of
the
future
at
all
i
don
t
know
that
i
have
it
is
that
when
the
creator
is
collecting
the
dead
for
the
judgment
he
will
shed
a
tear
on
my
grave
and
knowing
my
unhappy
life
permit
me
to
sleep
on
if
this
can
not
be
my
fate
can
not
be
much
worse
elsewhere
than
it
is
here
and
for
the
chance
of
oblivion
i
am
willing
to
take
the
risk
in
any
event
my
judge
will
be
a
just
one
and
i
am
willing
to
appear
before
him
i
once
told
you
that
i
hoped
none
of
my
friends
would
be
permitted
to
look
upon
my
dead
face
therefore
i
request
that
you
do
not
look
at
me
when
you
visit
the
jail
to
arrange
for
my
burial
i
prefer
that
you
remember
my
face
as
you
saw
it
last
night
when
you
went
away
for
you
said
it
looked
natural
again
i
am
sure
that
when
last
you
looked
into
my
face
i
was
smiling
and
i
want
your
recollection
to
be
that
of
me
if
you
should
see
me
dead
the
horror
would
so
fasten
on
your
mind
that
you
would
always
think
of
my
eyes
as
set
and
staring
and
of
my
face
as
pale
and
ghastly
therefore
i
ask
that
you
do
not
look
at
me
or
permit
any
one
else
who
has
ever
been
my
friend
to
do
so
you
will
find
me
ready
for
burial
as
i
shall
dress
for
that
purpose
before
taking
the
draught
which
will
end
my
life
when
i
feel
death
approaching
i
intend
to
fix
in
a
position
i
have
seen
dead
bodies
lie
in
so
that
i
shall
have
to
be
disturbed
as
little
as
possible
it
may
please
you
to
know
that
i
died
without
pain
that
i
went
to
sleep
and
never
wakened
among
the
books
i
had
access
to
at
barker
s
was
one
on
chemistry
and
on
pretence
of
illness
i
procured
a
drug
which
first
put
me
into
a
pleasant
sleep
and
then
killed
me
i
want
you
to
bury
me
in
fairview
churchyard
near
the
path
that
leads
toward
our
old
home
theodore
meek
has
three
children
buried
near
it
and
there
was
so
much
sorrow
when
they
died
and
there
was
always
so
much
love
and
kindness
in
that
family
that
i
should
like
to
be
in
their
company
you
and
i
always
chose
that
path
on
our
way
to
and
from
the
church
and
i
shall
think
of
two
pairs
of
little
feet
forever
travelling
up
and
down
it
spirits
of
the
past
keeping
vigil
over
my
grave
i
am
sure
that
you
and
agnes
will
frequently
visit
it
and
talk
tenderly
of
me
and
i
hope
that
grim
and
honest
damon
barker
will
stop
there
when
he
passes
the
church
and
go
away
in
deep
reflection
i
have
never
imagined
that
mateel
will
visit
it
but
if
she
should
if
it
should
ever
appear
that
i
was
in
any
way
mistaken
in
this
unhappy
business
i
hope
you
will
come
upon
her
while
she
is
there
and
say
that
jo
erring
loved
her
so
much
that
he
laid
down
his
life
for
her
sake
only
say
to
the
people
with
reference
to
me
that
i
took
life
in
a
wicked
moment
and
gave
my
own
to
avenge
it
and
that
i
died
in
the
full
possession
of
all
my
faculties
they
may
be
unable
to
understand
why
my
life
has
been
such
a
tragedy
but
they
can
understand
that
i
have
made
all
the
reparation
possible
for
a
crime
which
i
could
not
help
committing
i
have
only
to
say
now
that
if
you
could
realize
how
unhappy
i
am
you
would
freely
forgive
my
action
and
feel
that
it
was
for
the
best
as
i
made
you
say
before
you
went
away
for
your
numberless
acts
of
kindness
to
me
i
can
only
thank
you
which
is
a
small
return
but
i
have
nothing
else
it
is
now
eleven
o
clock
in
half
an
hour
i
shall
be
dead
and
i
find
that
i
am
stronger
in
my
purpose
than
ever
before
there
is
but
one
sad
duty
yet
before
me
that
is
to
write
jo
erring
barker
and
the
sheriff
were
sitting
beside
me
when
i
had
finished
reading
the
letter
aloud
and
while
i
was
hurriedly
dressing
i
heard
the
sheriff
say
to
barker
that
after
i
left
the
jail
the
evening
before
jo
fell
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
where
he
remained
a
long
while
but
at
length
recovered
his
composure
and
stood
looking
out
of
the
window
in
the
direction
i
had
taken
until
long
after
the
night
had
come
on
later
in
the
evening
he
pitied
his
lonely
condition
so
much
that
he
went
in
to
sit
awhile
with
him
but
he
had
little
to
say
and
showed
a
disposition
to
retire
early
in
the
morning
he
remembered
his
strange
agitation
of
the
night
before
and
opening
the
cell
door
soon
after
he
saw
him
lying
on
his
bed
covered
with
a
white
sheet
going
in
he
found
him
dead
and
dressed
for
burial
lying
on
his
back
with
his
hands
in
which
was
clutched
the
letter
addressed
to
me
folded
across
his
breast
he
had
not
even
told
his
wife
of
the
discovery
so
that
in
the
minds
of
the
people
jo
erring
was
still
alive
we
went
to
the
jail
together
and
admitting
ourselves
to
the
room
where
the
body
lay
decided
what
to
do
it
was
agreed
that
a
coroner
s
jury
should
be
summoned
from
among
jo
s
friends
who
would
hold
an
inquest
immediately
after
which
we
would
take
the
body
to
fairview
for
burial
fortunately
we
found
a
number
of
his
friends
in
town
among
them
theodore
meek
and
lytle
biggs
and
summoning
them
to
the
jail
they
first
heard
of
the
death
there
after
we
were
all
inside
i
read
the
letter
to
them
and
as
none
of
them
wished
to
look
at
the
face
after
listening
to
what
jo
had
written
it
was
agreed
that
the
coroner
who
was
a
physician
should
examine
the
body
alone
and
that
the
verdict
should
be
in
accordance
with
his
discoveries
the
verdict
was
death
from
poison
administered
by
his
own
hands
and
we
all
signed
it
by
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
the
sheriff
and
his
assistant
had
the
body
arranged
in
a
neat
burial
case
which
barker
and
i
had
procured
and
a
messenger
having
been
sent
ahead
to
dig
the
grave
and
notify
agnes
at
three
o
clock
the
little
procession
left
the
jail
yard
for
fairview
barker
and
i
led
the
way
with
a
light
wagon
in
which
was
the
coffin
and
a
half
dozen
other
vehicles
followed
carrying
a
few
people
from
town
and
those
of
the
fairview
men
who
had
been
on
the
jury
there
was
a
great
crowd
present
when
we
drove
away
and
as
we
passed
down
the
street
a
great
many
women
and
children
came
out
of
the
different
doors
with
offerings
of
flowers
which
they
either
tossed
to
me
or
laid
on
the
casket
owing
to
the
slow
pace
at
which
we
travelled
we
did
not
come
in
sight
of
fairview
church
until
near
dark
and
just
as
the
steeple
appeared
there
was
a
single
stroke
of
the
great
bell
this
continued
at
intervals
until
strokes
had
been
tolled
when
it
ceased
entirely
which
was
quite
right
as
the
deceased
would
not
have
been
years
old
for
several
months
we
had
halted
in
front
of
the
gate
by
this
time
and
i
saw
that
a
great
many
people
were
present
that
some
of
them
carried
lanterns
and
that
they
respectfully
uncovered
their
heads
as
they
gathered
about
the
wagon
in
which
the
coffin
lay
six
stout
young
men
appearing
they
carried
the
casket
to
the
grave
by
the
path
where
all
the
people
followed
and
it
was
put
down
on
two
sticks
laid
across
it
if
ever
i
felt
an
unfriendliness
for
the
people
there
it
vanished
as
i
stood
sobbing
by
the
grave
of
my
only
relative
and
best
friend
many
of
the
women
were
softly
crying
as
i
remembered
them
when
they
told
of
their
heavy
crosses
and
burdens
at
the
experience
meetings
and
when
some
one
of
the
number
began
singing
a
hymn
full
of
hope
and
forgiveness
i
thought
i
never
could
thank
them
enough
for
the
kindness
i
had
expected
that
only
a
few
idlers
would
attend
but
all
the
neighborhood
was
there
and
they
showed
that
they
loved
jo
and
respected
him
in
spite
of
his
crime
i
had
not
shed
a
tear
until
i
saw
the
open
grave
my
grief
was
so
great
that
i
could
not
find
even
that
poor
relief
but
i
could
not
control
myself
then
and
wept
as
i
never
had
before
i
shuddered
when
i
remembered
that
i
had
often
sung
in
mockery
the
hymn
the
people
were
singing
how
i
hoped
jo
had
not
but
i
am
sure
it
was
not
intended
for
mockery
and
that
we
did
not
think
what
we
were
doing
there
was
a
slight
pause
just
before
the
straps
were
put
under
the
coffin
to
lower
it
into
the
grave
and
greatly
to
the
surprise
of
every
one
rev
goode
shepherd
came
pushing
his
way
through
the
crowd
i
saw
in
one
glance
that
he
was
poorly
dressed
and
pale
and
distressed
and
taking
a
place
at
the
head
of
the
grave
he
delivered
an
address
which
i
have
never
heard
surpassed
in
tenderness
and
paid
a
tribute
to
the
dead
which
started
the
tears
of
the
tired
sorrowing
women
afresh
when
he
had
finished
he
raised
his
trembling
hands
to
heaven
and
prayed
fervently
for
the
peace
and
rest
of
all
weary
men
beyond
the
grave
he
then
stepped
aside
to
make
room
for
the
young
men
who
were
to
lower
the
coffin
and
though
we
looked
for
him
afterward
he
could
not
be
found
when
the
grave
was
filled
up
i
remember
sitting
down
upon
the
mound
and
sobbing
afresh
and
that
the
women
who
had
known
my
mother
some
of
them
had
heard
my
first
cry
when
i
came
into
the
world
put
their
hands
tenderly
on
my
head
and
tried
to
comfort
me
i
could
not
thank
them
or
speak
and
one
by
one
they
went
away
until
i
was
alone
with
my
dead
but
there
was
a
figure
which
came
to
me
then
whose
touch
i
could
not
mistake
oh
agnes
how
welcome
chapter
xxxv
the
history
of
a
mistake
whether
jo
left
a
message
with
me
for
mateel
i
do
not
now
remember
it
seems
so
long
ago
but
it
must
have
been
an
unimportant
one
if
he
did
for
from
the
time
of
their
separation
to
his
death
he
talked
of
her
only
as
one
who
had
deliberately
meditated
and
agreed
to
his
disgrace
although
he
always
loved
her
he
believed
that
his
memory
must
have
passed
entirely
out
of
her
mind
during
the
time
they
lived
apart
and
was
ashamed
to
confess
it
even
to
me
in
the
face
of
her
contemplated
marriage
to
clinton
bragg
which
she
must
have
known
was
the
greatest
humiliation
to
which
she
could
subject
him
and
if
he
left
any
word
at
all
it
was
only
a
regret
that
their
lives
had
been
mutually
so
unhappy
i
had
not
seen
her
or
talked
with
any
one
who
had
since
the
dreadful
night
when
i
carried
her
moaning
into
her
father
s
house
and
i
knew
nothing
of
her
except
occasional
rumors
which
came
to
me
from
people
who
passed
that
way
that
she
was
very
ill
and
that
but
few
went
to
the
shepherds
and
that
none
of
those
who
did
ever
saw
mateel
but
the
appearance
of
her
father
at
jo
s
grave
and
his
tender
tribute
to
the
memory
of
my
dead
friend
affected
me
so
much
that
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
call
at
their
house
before
i
slept
i
can
not
explain
this
determination
further
than
that
i
was
anxious
to
appear
among
them
it
may
have
been
that
i
wanted
to
tell
them
how
good
and
brave
jo
had
always
been
and
how
much
he
loved
his
wife
to
the
last
or
it
might
have
been
that
i
was
convinced
there
was
some
terrible
mistake
on
our
part
for
the
appearance
of
shepherd
as
we
stood
around
the
grave
implied
that
he
had
one
friend
among
them
although
we
had
always
imagined
that
they
were
all
against
him
however
it
was
i
could
not
resist
the
impulse
to
call
at
their
house
that
night
and
when
we
arrived
at
the
mill
after
the
burial
i
informed
barker
and
agnes
of
my
determination
they
offered
no
objection
if
they
said
anything
at
all
and
i
still
remember
that
both
bade
me
tenderly
when
i
drove
away
into
the
darkness
leaving
them
standing
at
their
door
there
was
a
road
from
barker
s
to
the
home
of
the
shepherds
which
followed
the
river
a
distance
and
then
led
up
on
to
the
divide
where
their
house
was
built
and
i
was
very
familiar
with
it
having
travelled
it
many
times
it
was
the
road
which
jo
had
used
on
his
visits
to
mateel
when
he
was
an
apprentice
at
barker
s
and
part
of
it
the
road
which
clinton
bragg
had
travelled
on
his
fatal
journey
the
night
he
was
married
to
mateel
and
if
i
saw
one
spectre
in
the
darkness
around
me
i
saw
a
thousand
the
story
i
have
written
was
produced
in
white
lines
etched
on
the
darkness
of
the
night
jo
returning
from
the
minister
s
house
young
and
hopeful
jo
going
to
his
own
home
with
mateel
by
his
side
a
little
older
and
looking
careworn
but
still
hopeful
jo
coming
toward
barker
s
after
the
separation
from
mateel
with
a
frown
upon
his
face
so
fierce
and
distressed
that
i
could
not
tell
whether
his
enemy
should
pity
or
fear
him
jo
skulking
behind
the
trees
and
watching
up
the
road
jo
carrying
mateel
in
his
arms
and
clambering
up
the
hill
which
led
from
the
mill
to
his
house
jo
in
jail
with
the
white
shroud
about
him
under
which
none
of
us
was
to
look
and
wherever
i
turned
my
eyes
upward
or
downward
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
ahead
or
behind
was
his
grave
which
i
had
just
left
at
fairview
clinton
bragg
was
lying
under
every
tree
first
as
i
had
seen
him
dead
in
the
woods
and
then
as
he
lay
surrounded
by
the
crowd
in
the
town
and
walking
wearily
in
front
of
me
was
my
father
bending
low
under
a
heavy
burden
which
he
carried
if
i
whipped
up
the
horses
and
hurried
on
the
spectre
disappeared
for
a
moment
but
after
i
had
slowed
up
again
and
had
almost
forgotten
it
in
feeling
my
way
through
the
trees
it
appeared
ahead
of
me
as
before
only
that
the
load
he
carried
was
heavier
and
that
he
pursued
his
journey
with
more
difficulty
this
fancy
took
such
hold
upon
my
imagination
that
i
thought
of
the
distant
light
which
finally
appeared
as
the
lamp
which
always
burned
in
my
mother
s
room
toward
which
the
bending
figure
was
always
travelling
and
when
it
turned
out
to
be
a
light
in
shepherd
s
window
i
looked
about
for
the
man
with
the
load
on
his
back
but
he
had
disappeared
with
jo
and
bragg
and
the
rest
of
them
my
timid
knock
at
the
door
was
answered
by
shepherd
himself
who
carried
a
light
in
his
hand
as
he
did
on
the
night
when
i
had
seen
him
last
and
he
seemed
as
much
surprised
as
when
i
had
stood
on
the
same
steps
a
few
months
before
bearing
his
moaning
child
in
my
arms
for
he
started
back
and
throwing
his
unoccupied
hand
to
his
head
looked
first
at
me
and
then
around
the
room
as
though
he
ought
to
recollect
but
somehow
could
not
when
he
recovered
himself
which
he
did
apparently
on
discovering
that
i
carried
no
insensible
form
in
my
arms
he
set
down
the
light
he
carried
to
the
door
and
asked
me
to
be
seated
which
i
did
feeling
uncertain
whether
after
all
i
had
not
better
have
remained
away
not
knowing
what
to
say
my
errand
was
should
he
ask
the
question
he
put
his
hand
to
his
head
again
as
if
he
always
felt
a
pain
there
now
and
could
only
forget
it
in
moments
of
excitement
and
then
resting
his
arm
on
the
table
at
which
he
had
seated
himself
looked
at
the
floor
in
the
piteous
helpless
way
which
was
common
to
him
i
thought
if
he
had
spoken
it
would
have
been
that
he
was
very
sorry
but
really
he
could
not
help
it
he
brushed
the
tears
out
of
his
eyes
with
his
sleeve
as
my
father
did
when
i
had
seen
him
last
and
as
though
he
had
been
warned
not
to
cry
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
thought
the
two
were
much
alike
perhaps
all
men
are
alike
when
they
are
old
and
poor
and
broken
i
knew
now
for
the
first
time
that
he
was
distressed
as
much
on
jo
s
account
as
on
mateel
s
that
there
was
equal
pity
in
his
heart
for
them
both
for
his
manner
indicated
it
as
much
as
if
he
had
made
the
declaration
my
poor
children
he
said
as
if
they
both
stood
before
him
how
you
both
have
suffered
and
neither
to
blame
both
of
them
were
always
doing
what
they
thought
to
be
for
the
best
but
always
wrong
my
poor
children
i
had
never
thought
of
this
before
neither
to
blame
and
always
wrong
but
i
felt
now
that
it
was
true
in
my
own
mind
i
had
accused
mateel
but
her
good
old
father
called
them
both
his
unhappy
children
and
said
neither
was
to
blame
and
in
my
heart
i
could
not
think
less
when
mateel
came
home
after
the
unfortunate
separation
shepherd
continued
timidly
looking
about
the
room
as
if
to
assure
himself
that
no
ghosts
were
present
to
accuse
him
although
i
thought
it
was
but
a
temporary
affair
i
regretted
it
no
more
on
account
of
the
one
than
the
other
and
through
it
all
during
the
long
months
which
have
brought
nothing
to
this
house
but
bruised
and
broken
hearts
i
have
had
this
sentiment
and
no
one
has
spoken
ill
of
him
here
any
more
than
they
have
spoken
ill
of
mateel
this
is
as
true
as
that
i
have
spoken
it
for
with
the
graves
filling
up
around
me
so
rapidly
i
could
not
give
reason
for
a
wrong
inference
even
if
i
were
anxious
to
excuse
a
mistaken
action
jo
has
always
had
justice
done
him
here
the
same
as
i
was
surprised
to
hear
this
for
i
had
felt
that
shepherd
and
bragg
had
upbraided
jo
to
mateel
to
induce
her
to
take
the
step
she
did
and
that
her
father
held
his
peace
if
he
did
not
approve
of
it
we
never
talked
about
it
but
this
was
the
understanding
jo
and
i
had
and
i
think
we
accepted
it
so
thoroughly
that
we
blamed
mateel
that
she
permitted
it
we
thought
she
had
little
regard
for
her
husband
that
she
allowed
her
mother
and
clinton
bragg
to
counsel
her
against
him
and
i
began
to
realize
that
in
this
we
had
been
cruel
and
unjust
i
allowed
them
to
do
what
they
pleased
he
went
on
again
slowly
and
painfully
hoping
and
praying
it
would
all
turn
out
for
the
best
but
i
always
thought
of
jo
as
one
of
my
children
and
have
been
tempted
to
call
on
him
in
his
lonely
home
and
tell
him
how
sorry
i
was
it
had
happened
i
knew
how
unhappy
a
man
of
his
fine
ability
must
have
been
under
such
unfortunate
circumstances
but
my
pride
kept
me
from
it
i
see
now
that
there
has
been
too
much
pride
all
around
in
this
affair
i
have
known
it
all
the
time
but
i
knew
what
he
was
going
to
say
but
i
could
not
help
it
really
i
could
not
i
have
done
the
best
i
could
but
it
has
gone
wrong
in
spite
of
he
was
always
saying
that
everything
went
wrong
in
spite
of
him
which
has
been
the
experience
of
so
many
thousands
before
him
but
i
felt
with
a
keen
pang
of
conscience
that
he
had
done
more
than
i
for
while
i
was
secretly
blaming
mateel
he
did
not
blame
jo
that
while
i
had
never
thought
of
aiding
a
reconciliation
unless
mateel
should
ask
it
that
had
been
his
one
prayer
and
hope
i
see
now
after
it
is
too
late
somehow
i
never
see
anything
in
time
to
be
of
use
to
others
or
to
myself
that
this
is
all
a
dreadful
mistake
you
have
not
said
it
but
your
coming
here
tells
me
that
what
i
think
is
true
that
he
was
always
waiting
for
mateel
to
come
to
him
and
i
know
so
well
that
she
was
always
praying
that
he
would
come
to
her
not
to
ask
forgiveness
but
to
say
he
missed
her
and
loved
her
and
that
his
home
and
heart
were
lonely
she
was
waiting
for
him
to
write
her
just
a
line
what
a
little
thing
to
have
prevented
all
this
that
she
must
see
him
or
die
as
she
will
die
now
without
it
he
was
expecting
a
simple
request
from
his
wife
to
come
to
her
and
had
it
been
sent
my
brave
jo
would
have
come
though
a
thousand
braggs
blocked
the
he
got
up
from
his
chair
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
wringing
his
hands
helplessly
and
repeating
my
poor
children
my
poor
children
how
they
have
suffered
we
thought
in
our
pride
how
unjust
it
was
i
now
see
though
you
have
not
said
a
word
that
he
was
determined
to
live
without
her
and
that
he
had
steeled
his
heart
against
a
reconciliation
and
you
believed
that
we
were
determined
she
should
not
go
back
to
him
except
upon
promises
and
conditions
but
i
swear
to
you
my
belief
that
she
would
have
crawled
on
her
knees
to
her
old
home
had
she
believed
he
would
have
admitted
her
from
what
has
happened
since
i
know
he
loved
her
all
the
time
and
that
he
was
expecting
a
summons
to
come
to
her
every
moment
of
the
day
and
night
what
a
little
thing
would
have
prevented
all
this
a
word
from
you
or
me
and
it
would
have
been
done
but
we
have
kept
apart
from
the
beginning
until
the
end
we
shall
have
to
answer
for
it
i
fear
and
i
shall
not
know
what
to
say
at
the
i
thought
i
knew
what
he
would
say
i
could
not
help
it
but
what
would
my
own
answer
be
perhaps
only
what
millions
of
other
trembling
men
will
say
i
did
the
best
i
could
i
did
not
in
looking
toward
him
to
make
reply
and
assure
him
that
he
was
right
in
his
generous
surmise
i
became
aware
that
some
one
was
standing
just
inside
the
door
which
led
into
the
other
room
and
taking
a
quick
glance
i
saw
it
was
mateel
dressed
in
a
long
white
that
she
waited
rather
than
listened
and
that
she
was
much
agitated
from
the
door
came
the
odor
of
a
sick
room
and
in
that
one
glance
i
saw
that
she
was
very
pale
and
very
weak
and
very
ill
instinctively
i
moved
in
my
chair
to
get
my
face
away
from
the
door
instead
of
turning
it
and
betraying
that
i
had
seen
her
and
as
i
did
this
i
heard
her
light
step
enter
the
room
i
saw
her
father
look
up
in
wonder
and
knew
that
her
mother
followed
in
a
frightened
way
and
gently
laid
hands
on
her
entreating
her
to
return
but
she
put
them
off
and
came
on
toward
me
i
had
only
a
side
glance
but
i
could
see
that
her
eyes
were
riveted
on
me
and
that
she
leaned
forward
in
a
supplicating
way
jo
my
husband
she
said
timidly
and
pausing
to
put
her
hands
to
her
head
as
her
father
had
done
why
have
you
delayed
coming
so
long
she
fell
on
her
knees
when
i
did
not
reply
and
looked
at
me
with
a
pitiful
face
indicating
that
she
would
shortly
burst
out
crying
i
turned
in
my
chair
that
she
might
see
that
i
was
not
her
husband
but
her
mind
was
troubled
and
she
did
not
realize
it
indeed
when
i
looked
steadily
into
her
eyes
she
seemed
to
take
it
as
an
accusation
from
jo
of
neglect
and
dishonor
and
she
staggered
to
her
feet
again
as
if
determined
to
tell
her
story
there
was
a
look
of
mingled
timidity
sorrow
and
sickness
in
her
face
which
comes
to
me
yet
when
i
am
alone
and
which
i
can
never
forget
i
was
afraid
you
might
not
understand
that
i
always
wanted
you
to
come
she
said
coming
near
to
me
and
gently
stroking
my
hand
as
if
hoping
to
thus
induce
a
fierce
man
to
listen
until
she
had
concluded
but
i
thought
you
would
and
night
and
day
since
i
have
been
away
from
home
such
a
long
time
it
has
been
oh
such
a
very
long
time
i
have
expected
you
every
moment
every
noise
i
have
thought
your
step
and
when
i
found
it
was
not
i
listened
and
hoped
again
you
have
never
been
out
of
my
thoughts
for
a
moment
but
my
prayers
have
been
answered
for
i
was
always
praying
for
you
to
come
i
wanted
to
tell
you
how
truly
i
have
always
loved
you
and
how
unhappy
and
ill
i
have
been
without
it
was
turning
out
as
i
had
expected
after
the
appearance
of
shepherd
at
the
grave
but
how
distressed
i
was
to
realize
that
the
explanation
came
after
jo
was
dead
and
mateel
hopelessly
ill
i
am
not
competent
to
write
i
could
say
nothing
then
as
i
can
write
nothing
now
of
the
horror
i
felt
when
i
knew
that
all
this
misery
had
been
unnecessary
as
mateel
stood
before
me
she
staggered
in
her
weakness
and
her
mother
hurried
to
her
side
but
again
she
put
her
off
and
stood
erect
with
an
effort
i
must
tell
you
to
relieve
my
own
mind
if
for
nothing
else
that
i
have
always
been
true
to
you
and
that
i
only
consented
to
receive
clinton
bragg
in
this
house
in
the
hope
that
you
would
rescue
me
i
was
afraid
it
might
be
wrong
but
i
did
not
know
what
else
to
do
i
hoped
that
when
you
heard
that
he
was
coming
here
you
would
walk
in
like
the
brave
man
that
you
are
and
demand
to
know
what
it
meant
then
you
would
give
me
opportunity
to
explain
and
i
hoped
you
would
praise
me
for
making
us
happy
i
thought
that
her
father
and
mother
were
surprised
at
this
for
they
looked
curiously
at
each
other
and
shepherd
s
hand
went
to
his
head
again
i
thought
to
upbraid
it
for
not
discovering
the
secret
sooner
i
am
sorry
it
has
offended
you
jo
but
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
and
i
desired
to
see
you
so
much
i
was
always
weak
and
helpless
and
perhaps
i
did
wrong
but
i
felt
that
i
must
do
something
when
still
you
did
not
come
i
let
it
be
said
that
i
intended
to
marry
him
but
it
was
all
for
love
of
my
husband
god
is
my
witness
and
i
appeal
to
him
i
had
no
more
thought
of
marrying
him
than
i
had
of
forgetting
you
but
because
you
still
delayed
i
let
the
time
be
set
believing
that
you
would
not
allow
it
to
go
on
and
give
me
opportunity
to
explain
when
the
day
arrived
i
determined
to
let
it
go
on
and
if
you
did
not
rescue
me
from
him
before
i
passed
our
home
on
the
way
to
town
i
would
take
one
fond
look
at
the
place
where
i
was
once
so
happy
and
kill
myself
so
that
i
might
be
carried
dead
where
i
was
refused
admission
alive
i
was
very
firm
in
this
purpose
and
would
have
carried
it
out
see
i
have
the
knife
she
took
from
her
bosom
a
dirk
knife
of
peculiar
pattern
which
barker
had
given
jo
and
me
when
we
were
boys
and
we
had
sharpened
it
so
often
that
the
blade
was
very
thin
and
delicate
she
tested
its
sharpness
by
passing
her
finger
across
its
edge
and
holding
it
toward
me
asked
me
to
see
how
keen
it
was
when
you
sprang
out
from
among
the
trees
on
that
dreadful
night
i
had
been
expecting
you
to
spring
out
just
as
you
did
every
moment
during
the
ride
my
joy
was
so
great
that
i
fainted
and
when
i
awoke
it
was
with
such
a
strange
feeling
in
my
head
but
i
will
recover
soon
and
then
we
shall
be
happy
once
more
i
can
t
remember
when
it
happened
yesterday
maybe
but
not
long
ago
and
when
i
asked
for
you
mother
said
you
had
gone
out
but
would
return
presently
if
i
waited
patiently
after
i
had
waited
a
long
while
i
wanted
to
go
to
you
for
i
knew
you
loved
me
and
wanted
me
to
come
but
they
said
i
must
wait
i
did
whatever
they
told
me
for
they
said
i
must
or
you
would
not
come
at
all
but
won
t
you
speak
to
me
now
since
i
have
explained
it
all
she
was
again
on
her
knees
before
me
and
looking
earnestly
into
my
face
at
first
entreatingly
but
suddenly
i
saw
a
change
and
there
was
alarm
in
her
pale
face
she
recognized
me
i
thought
and
i
steadily
looked
at
her
that
she
might
realize
her
mistake
hurriedly
rising
to
her
feet
she
walked
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
stood
beside
her
mother
with
an
arm
on
her
shoulder
still
looking
at
me
in
alarm
and
fright
oh
mother
she
said
hesitatingly
maybe
it
is
not
jo
what
if
he
should
be
dead
and
never
know
wouldn
t
that
be
terrible
she
was
so
much
exhausted
now
that
she
started
wearily
to
return
to
her
bed
still
looking
at
me
as
she
went
apparently
better
convinced
than
ever
that
i
was
not
jo
and
her
father
and
mother
tenderly
supported
her
as
she
walked
they
slowly
passed
through
the
door
and
into
her
room
and
i
saw
them
gently
lay
her
down
where
she
asked
again
in
a
weak
but
excited
voice
if
it
wouldn
t
be
terrible
if
jo
were
dead
and
would
never
know
i
looked
again
and
saw
shepherd
and
his
wife
kneeling
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
convulsively
sobbing
each
one
trying
to
comfort
the
other
and
both
of
them
trying
to
comfort
mateel
i
noticed
then
that
the
minister
and
his
wife
were
poorly
dressed
that
the
furniture
of
the
rooms
was
threadbare
and
old
and
it
came
to
my
mind
that
they
were
very
poor
and
had
been
cruelly
neglected
by
those
around
them
all
these
circumstances
affected
me
so
much
that
i
stepped
out
at
the
front
door
to
recover
myself
and
was
surprised
to
find
agnes
and
barker
at
the
gate
they
explained
that
they
had
been
oppressed
with
the
same
fear
that
oppressed
me
and
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
drive
over
i
hurriedly
told
them
that
it
was
as
i
feared
and
gave
them
as
many
particulars
as
i
could
before
we
went
into
the
house
they
were
visibly
affected
and
as
i
pointed
around
at
the
general
evidences
of
decay
in
whispering
the
fear
that
during
mateel
s
illness
and
while
both
were
busy
in
caring
for
her
they
had
suffered
from
poverty
i
became
aware
that
barker
had
been
a
friend
to
them
during
the
time
sending
them
money
and
such
comforts
as
the
country
afforded
although
they
never
knew
who
befriended
them
i
can
not
remember
what
it
was
he
did
to
convince
me
of
this
but
i
was
certain
of
it
and
the
opinion
was
afterwards
confirmed
for
agnes
knew
of
it
and
told
me
it
must
have
been
an
hour
after
midnight
when
we
went
into
the
house
and
though
the
minister
and
his
wife
were
surprised
to
see
barker
and
agnes
they
were
pleased
as
well
and
somehow
seemed
to
think
that
matters
would
get
on
better
now
for
they
were
more
cheerful
than
before
as
though
the
neglect
of
their
friends
had
been
very
humiliating
mateel
had
fallen
into
a
light
sleep
soon
after
lying
down
but
she
wakened
in
the
course
of
an
hour
and
still
talked
of
how
long
how
patiently
she
had
waited
for
jo
and
how
terrible
it
would
be
if
he
were
dead
and
could
never
know
at
times
she
seemed
to
realize
that
he
would
never
come
when
she
remained
silent
a
long
while
as
if
to
think
it
all
over
but
she
would
soon
forget
this
and
say
that
while
she
was
patient
and
would
wait
as
long
as
she
could
she
hoped
he
would
hurry
as
she
was
growing
weak
so
fast
and
was
so
anxious
to
see
him
and
explain
it
all
we
were
all
very
quiet
occasionally
walking
carefully
from
one
room
to
another
as
a
relief
after
sitting
a
long
time
in
one
position
and
it
so
happened
that
we
were
all
standing
around
mateel
s
bed
when
she
asked
father
do
you
believe
jo
is
in
heaven
the
good
man
was
startled
by
the
question
not
knowing
how
to
reply
but
after
thinking
a
moment
he
answered
speaking
with
an
effort
it
is
my
hope
of
the
future
that
when
i
enter
the
beautiful
gates
i
shall
find
jo
erring
waiting
for
me
where
i
can
explain
away
all
that
has
seemed
mysterious
here
as
i
believe
in
the
mercy
of
god
i
expect
to
meet
him
and
enjoy
his
intelligence
and
friendship
both
of
which
i
have
always
esteemed
as
i
believe
in
my
wife
and
child
as
i
believe
in
my
religion
i
believe
in
jo
the
invalid
seemed
much
pleased
with
this
assurance
and
simply
said
i
am
glad
he
will
know
that
i
was
not
fickle
or
false
for
i
will
explain
it
to
she
closed
her
eyes
then
and
we
all
stepped
softly
out
of
the
room
to
allow
her
to
sleep
but
when
her
mother
went
back
a
few
moments
later
she
found
that
the
unhappy
woman
was
dead
chapter

conclusion
it
has
been
ten
years
since
we
buried
mateel
beside
her
husband
in
fairview
churchyard
and
built
monuments
over
their
graves
i
have
been
rid
of
my
tiresome
business
so
many
years
that
i
seem
never
to
have
been
in
it
at
all
and
i
can
scarcely
remember
the
time
when
agnes
was
not
my
wife
damon
barker
lives
with
us
in
the
stone
house
in
twin
mounds
which
has
been
rebuilt
and
remodelled
so
often
that
it
too
enjoys
a
new
condition
and
i
sometimes
fear
we
do
not
think
so
much
of
jo
and
mateel
as
we
ought
or
of
the
rev
john
westlock
and
the
poor
woman
who
died
of
a
broken
heart
for
somehow
we
can
not
help
thinking
of
them
all
as
having
lived
a
long
while
ago
so
many
changes
have
taken
place
since
they
were
among
us
many
of
the
people
who
lived
in
fairview
and
twin
mounds
when
they
did
are
dead
others
have
moved
away
and
so
many
strangers
have
arrived
that
it
seems
like
a
new
country
and
one
in
which
those
who
occupy
our
graves
never
lived
in
looking
through
jo
erring
s
room
at
the
jail
after
his
death
we
found
a
will
bequeathing
his
property
to
me
a
certain
amount
to
be
paid
yearly
to
mateel
and
the
mill
i
have
since
leased
to
such
advantage
that
it
has
been
the
source
of
a
great
deal
of
profit
if
i
have
not
mentioned
it
before
it
may
be
interesting
to
know
that
my
father
s
wild
land
of
which
he
owned
a
large
quantity
has
greatly
increased
in
value
and
i
was
thinking
only
a
few
days
ago
that
i
was
worth
considerable
money
and
that
my
income
was
ample
to
support
me
without
work
of
any
kind
in
addition
deming
died
possessed
of
some
property
which
came
into
the
possession
of
agnes
and
with
barker
s
money
we
are
quite
an
aristocratic
family
big
adam
operates
the
mill
on
bull
river
under
lease
and
i
have
understood
that
in
a
few
years
he
will
be
in
condition
to
buy
it
outright
i
am
sincerely
glad
of
this
for
he
is
a
very
worthy
man
and
has
had
a
wife
and
children
of
his
own
these
five
or
six
years
it
is
said
of
big
adam
and
his
wife
that
they
are
the
happiest
couple
in
all
that
country
and
i
often
go
there
to
witness
how
contented
and
fortunate
the
good
fellow
is
after
his
hard
life
not
long
ago
i
was
sitting
with
him
in
the
mill
after
dark
and
when
i
told
him
how
much
satisfaction
his
happiness
afforded
me
he
made
the
old
reply
of
pulling
an
imaginary
cork
and
pouring
out
liquor
in
distinct
gurgles
his
bandit
father
was
killed
a
few
years
ago
in
attempting
to
rob
a
railroad
train
but
big
adam
still
occasionally
tells
that
his
father
gave
up
his
life
in
the
early
settlement
of
the
west
in
short
that
he
was
killed
by
the
indians
there
has
been
little
change
in
biggs
or
smoky
hill
except
that
both
have
grown
older
and
improved
a
little
i
drove
over
to
that
country
not
long
ago
in
quest
of
a
servant
girl
remembering
that
biggs
had
said
that
it
produced
good
ones
and
learned
that
two
or
three
of
his
sons
were
very
idle
and
bad
and
made
their
mother
and
their
neighbors
a
great
deal
of
trouble
biggs
himself
is
a
great
deal
in
town
as
he
has
opened
a
kind
of
office
there
for
the
sale
of
land
although
i
suspect
that
it
is
no
more
than
an
excuse
to
keep
away
from
home
i
hear
from
him
frequently
with
reference
to
the
management
of
children
for
there
have
been
several
occasions
to
mention
the
subject
but
for
all
that
it
is
notorious
that
he
has
not
the
slightest
control
of
his
own
i
have
heard
that
his
oldest
son
beat
him
on
one
of
his
visits
to
the
farm
for
he
is
much
larger
than
his
father
and
of
a
very
ugly
disposition
in
spite
of
the
circumstance
that
he
wore
braid
on
his
clothes
until
he
was
seven
or
eight
years
old
i
have
never
yet
seen
biggs
for
her
husband
appealed
to
me
a
good
many
years
ago
never
to
visit
his
house
if
i
respected
him
as
it
did
not
correctly
represent
him
agnes
goes
out
occasionally
to
quell
an
insurrection
among
the
children
who
have
the
greatest
respect
for
her
and
she
tells
me
that
i
may
hope
to
see
biggs
soon
as
she
can
not
possibly
live
much
longer
and
that
we
shall
be
expected
to
attend
the
funeral
i
think
at
least
a
half
dozen
of
theodore
meek
s
boys
have
married
and
settled
around
him
on
the
fairview
prairie
and
their
children
are
as
much
at
home
in
the
old
house
as
in
the
new
ones
when
i
was
last
there
i
could
scarcely
get
into
the
house
for
them
and
my
impression
was
that
the
boys
had
married
well
for
they
were
all
very
prosperous
and
very
contented
their
nearest
neighbors
were
the
winter
boys
who
have
developed
into
honorable
and
worthy
citizens
their
father
has
been
in
heaven
some
years
and
they
seem
to
be
very
proud
of
the
reputation
he
left
in
fairview
and
take
good
care
of
their
mother
who
manages
their
house
as
they
have
never
married
the
rev
john
westlock
has
never
been
heard
of
since
the
stormy
night
when
i
saw
him
turn
a
corner
in
a
twin
mounds
street
and
disappear
and
if
he
is
alive
this
night
i
do
not
know
it
no
more
than
i
know
he
is
dead
i
have
published
advertisements
in
a
great
many
widely
circulated
newspapers
asking
him
to
let
me
know
of
his
whereabouts
and
soliciting
information
of
an
old
and
broken
man
of
his
description
i
have
made
several
journeys
in
answer
to
these
advertisements
but
the
men
i
found
were
not
at
all
like
him
and
i
have
come
to
believe
that
he
is
dead
but
if
he
is
not
and
this
should
meet
his
eye
i
trust
that
his
stubborn
heart
will
relent
and
that
he
will
consent
to
finish
his
days
in
peace
under
my
roof
rev
goode
shepherd
and
his
wife
returned
to
their
old
home
in
the
east
a
few
months
after
the
death
of
their
child
and
twice
since
they
have
journeyed
to
fairview
to
visit
her
grave
their
devotion
to
her
memory
is
very
touching
and
it
has
always
been
a
comfort
to
me
to
know
that
the
minister
still
believes
that
jo
has
been
forgiven
and
that
the
blessed
saviour
blotted
out
with
a
tear
the
record
of
his
desperate
crime
at
the
ford
i
hope
the
place
where
jo
and
mateel
are
buried
is
very
pretty
for
i
have
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
in
attempts
to
make
it
quietly
attractive
and
my
heart
has
always
been
in
the
work
while
everything
else
has
changed
fairview
church
is
just
the
same
and
every
night
when
the
wind
blows
furiously
i
imagine
that
the
great
bell
is
tolling
a
muffled
requiem
for
their
unfortunate
history
from
the
rickety
tower
every
bright
day
i
think
that
the
birds
are
singing
softly
over
their
graves
and
in
their
quiet
corner
of
the
yard
close
by
the
path
leading
toward
the
old
house
where
they
first
met
there
is
a
willow
that
weeps
for
them
in
summer
and
tenderly
covers
their
graves
with
its
leaves
in
winter
i
think
it
was
planted
by
theodore
meek
in
whose
family
there
was
always
so
much
love
and
content
and
i
am
sure
that
whenever
the
good
man
visits
his
own
dead
he
sends
a
message
upward
for
jo
erring
