chapter
i
graduation
day
in
the
year
the
student
and
the
statesman
saw
many
indications
that
the
social
financial
and
industrial
troubles
that
had
vexed
the
united
states
of
america
for
so
long
a
time
were
about
to
culminate
in
civil
war
wealth
had
grown
so
strong
that
the
few
were
about
to
strangle
the
many
and
among
the
great
masses
of
the
people
there
was
sullen
and
rebellious
discontent
the
laborer
in
the
cities
the
producer
on
the
farm
the
merchant
the
professional
man
and
all
save
organized
capital
and
its
satellites
saw
a
gloomy
and
hopeless
future
with
these
conditions
prevailing
the
graduation
exercises
of
the
class
of
of
the
national
military
academy
at
west
point
held
for
many
a
foreboding
promise
of
momentous
changes
but
the
of
june
found
the
usual
gay
scene
at
the
great
institution
overlooking
the
hudson
the
president
of
the
republic
his
secretary
of
war
and
many
other
distinguished
guests
were
there
to
do
honor
to
the
occasion
together
with
friends
relatives
and
admirers
of
the
young
men
who
were
being
sent
out
to
the
ultimate
leadership
of
the
nation
army
the
scene
had
all
the
usual
charm
of
west
point
graduations
and
the
usual
intoxicating
atmosphere
of
military
display
there
was
among
the
young
graduating
soldiers
one
who
seemed
depressed
and
out
of
touch
with
the
triumphant
blare
of
militarism
for
he
alone
of
his
fellow
classmen
had
there
no
kith
nor
kin
to
bid
him
in
his
new
career
standing
apart
under
the
broad
shadow
of
an
oak
he
looked
out
over
long
stretches
of
forest
and
river
but
what
he
saw
was
his
home
in
distant
kentucky
the
old
farmhouse
that
the
sun
and
the
rain
and
the
lichens
had
softened
into
a
mottled
gray
he
saw
the
gleaming
brook
that
wound
its
way
through
the
tangle
of
orchard
and
garden
and
parted
the
distant
meadow
he
saw
his
aged
mother
sitting
under
the
honeysuckle
trellis
book
in
hand
but
thinking
he
knew
of
him
and
then
there
was
the
perfume
of
the
flowers
the
droning
of
the
bees
in
the
warm
sweet
air
and
the
drowsy
hound
at
his
father
feet
but
this
was
not
all
the
young
man
saw
for
philip
dru
in
spite
of
his
military
training
was
a
close
student
of
the
affairs
of
his
country
and
he
saw
that
which
raised
grave
doubts
in
his
mind
as
to
the
outcome
of
his
career
he
saw
many
of
the
civil
institutions
of
his
country
debased
by
the
power
of
wealth
under
the
thin
guise
of
the
constitutional
protection
of
property
he
saw
the
army
which
he
had
sworn
to
serve
faithfully
becoming
prostituted
by
this
same
power
and
used
at
times
for
purposes
of
intimidation
and
petty
conquests
where
the
interests
of
wealth
were
at
stake
he
saw
the
great
city
where
luxury
dominant
and
defiant
existed
largely
by
grace
of
exploitation
exploitation
of
men
women
and
children
the
young
man
eyes
had
become
bright
and
hard
when
his
was
interrupted
and
he
was
looking
into
the
eyes
of
gloria
strawn
the
one
whose
lot
he
had
been
comparing
to
that
of
her
sisters
in
the
city
in
the
mills
the
sweatshops
the
big
stores
and
the
streets
he
had
met
her
for
the
first
time
a
few
hours
before
when
his
friend
and
classmate
jack
strawn
had
presented
him
to
his
sister
no
comrade
knew
dru
better
than
strawn
and
no
one
admired
him
so
much
therefore
gloria
ever
seeking
a
closer
contact
with
life
had
come
to
west
point
eager
to
meet
the
lithe
young
kentuckian
and
to
measure
him
by
the
other
men
of
her
acquaintance
she
was
disappointed
in
his
appearance
for
she
had
fancied
him
almost
in
both
size
and
beauty
and
she
saw
a
man
of
medium
height
slender
but
toughly
knit
and
with
a
strong
but
homely
face
when
he
smiled
and
spoke
she
forgot
her
disappointment
and
her
interest
revived
for
her
sharp
city
sense
caught
the
trail
of
a
new
experience
to
philip
dru
whose
thought
of
and
experience
with
women
was
almost
nothing
so
engrossed
had
he
been
in
his
studies
military
and
economic
gloria
seemed
little
more
than
a
child
and
yet
her
frank
glance
of
appraisal
when
he
had
been
introduced
to
her
and
her
easy
though
somewhat
languid
conversation
on
the
affairs
of
the
commencement
perplexed
and
slightly
annoyed
him
he
even
felt
some
embarrassment
in
her
presence
child
though
he
knew
her
to
be
he
hesitated
whether
he
should
call
her
by
her
given
name
and
was
taken
aback
when
she
smilingly
thanked
him
for
doing
so
with
the
assurance
that
she
was
often
bored
with
the
eternal
conventionality
of
people
in
her
social
circle
suddenly
turning
from
the
commonplaces
of
the
day
gloria
looked
directly
at
philip
and
with
easy
turned
the
conversation
to
himself
i
am
wondering
dru
why
you
came
to
west
point
and
why
it
is
you
like
the
thought
of
being
a
soldier
she
asked
an
american
soldier
has
to
fight
so
seldom
that
i
have
heard
that
the
insurance
companies
regard
them
as
the
best
of
risks
so
what
attraction
dru
can
a
military
career
have
for
you
never
before
had
philip
been
asked
such
a
question
and
it
surprised
him
that
it
should
come
from
this
slip
of
a
girl
but
he
answered
her
in
the
serious
strain
of
his
thoughts
as
far
back
as
i
can
remember
he
said
i
have
wanted
to
be
a
soldier
i
have
no
desire
to
destroy
and
kill
and
yet
there
is
within
me
the
lust
for
action
and
battle
it
is
the
primitive
man
in
me
i
suppose
but
sobered
and
enlightened
by
civilization
i
would
do
everything
in
my
power
to
avert
war
and
the
suffering
it
entails
fate
inclination
or
what
not
has
brought
me
here
and
i
hope
my
life
may
not
be
wasted
but
that
in
god
own
way
i
may
be
a
humble
instrument
for
good
oftentimes
our
inclinations
lead
us
in
certain
directions
and
it
is
only
afterwards
that
it
seems
as
if
fate
may
from
the
first
have
so
determined
it
the
mischievous
twinkle
left
the
girl
eyes
and
the
languid
tone
of
her
voice
changed
to
one
a
little
more
like
sincerity
but
suppose
there
is
no
war
she
demanded
suppose
you
go
on
living
at
barracks
here
and
there
and
with
no
broader
outlook
than
such
a
life
entails
will
you
be
satisfied
is
that
all
you
have
in
mind
to
do
in
the
world
he
looked
at
her
more
perplexed
than
ever
such
an
observation
of
life
his
life
seemed
beyond
her
years
for
he
knew
but
little
of
the
women
of
his
own
generation
he
wondered
too
if
she
would
understand
if
he
told
her
all
that
was
in
his
mind
gloria
we
are
entering
a
new
era
the
past
is
no
longer
to
be
a
guide
to
the
future
a
century
and
a
half
ago
there
arose
in
france
a
giant
that
had
slumbered
for
untold
centuries
he
knew
he
had
suffered
grievous
wrongs
but
he
did
not
know
how
to
right
them
he
therefore
struck
out
blindly
and
cruelly
and
the
innocent
went
down
with
the
guilty
he
was
almost
wholly
ignorant
for
in
the
scheme
of
society
as
then
constructed
the
ruling
few
felt
that
he
must
be
kept
ignorant
otherwise
they
could
not
continue
to
hold
him
in
bondage
for
him
the
door
of
opportunity
was
closed
and
he
struggled
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
for
the
minimum
of
food
and
clothing
necessary
to
keep
breath
within
the
body
his
labor
and
his
very
life
itself
was
subject
to
the
greed
the
passion
and
the
caprice
of
his
so
when
he
awoke
he
could
only
destroy
unfortunately
for
him
there
was
not
one
of
the
governing
class
who
was
big
enough
and
humane
enough
to
lend
a
guiding
and
a
friendly
hand
so
he
was
led
by
weak
and
selfish
men
who
could
only
incite
him
to
further
wanton
murder
and
demolition
but
out
of
that
revelry
of
blood
there
dawned
upon
mankind
the
hope
of
a
more
splendid
day
the
divinity
of
kings
the
right
to
rule
was
shattered
for
all
time
the
giant
at
last
knew
his
strength
and
with
head
erect
and
the
light
of
freedom
in
his
eyes
he
dared
to
assert
the
liberty
equality
and
fraternity
of
man
then
throughout
the
western
world
one
stratum
of
society
after
another
demanded
and
obtained
the
right
to
acquire
wealth
and
to
share
in
the
government
here
and
there
one
bolder
and
more
forceful
than
the
rest
acquired
great
wealth
and
with
it
great
power
not
satisfied
with
reasonable
gain
they
sought
to
multiply
it
beyond
all
bounds
of
need
they
who
had
sprung
from
the
people
a
short
life
span
ago
were
now
throttling
individual
effort
and
shackling
the
great
movement
for
equal
rights
and
equal
opportunity
dru
voice
became
tense
and
vibrant
and
he
talked
in
quick
sharp
jerks
nowhere
in
the
world
is
wealth
more
defiant
and
monopoly
more
insistent
than
in
this
mighty
republic
he
said
and
it
is
here
that
the
next
great
battle
for
human
emancipation
will
be
fought
and
won
and
from
the
blood
and
travail
of
an
enlightened
people
there
will
be
born
a
spirit
of
love
and
brotherhood
which
will
transform
the
world
and
the
star
of
bethlehem
seen
but
darkly
for
two
thousand
years
will
shine
again
with
a
steady
and
effulgent
glow
chapter
ii
the
vision
of
philip
dru
long
before
philip
had
finished
speaking
gloria
saw
that
he
had
forgotten
her
presence
with
glistening
eyes
and
face
aflame
he
had
talked
on
and
on
with
such
compelling
force
that
she
beheld
in
him
the
prophet
of
a
new
day
she
sat
very
still
for
a
while
and
then
she
reached
out
to
touch
his
sleeve
i
think
i
understand
how
you
feel
now
she
said
in
a
tone
different
from
any
she
had
yet
used
i
have
been
reared
in
a
different
atmosphere
from
you
and
at
home
have
heard
only
the
other
side
while
at
school
they
mostly
evade
the
question
my
father
is
one
of
the
and
forceful
few
as
perhaps
you
know
but
he
does
not
seem
to
me
to
want
to
harm
anyone
he
is
kind
to
us
and
charitable
too
as
that
word
is
commonly
used
and
i
am
sure
he
has
done
much
good
with
his
money
i
am
sorry
gloria
if
i
have
hurt
you
by
what
i
said
answered
dru
oh
never
mind
for
i
am
sure
you
are
right
answered
the
girl
but
philip
continued
your
father
i
think
is
not
to
blame
it
is
the
system
that
is
at
fault
his
struggle
and
his
environment
from
childhood
have
blinded
him
to
the
truth
to
those
with
whom
he
has
come
in
contact
it
has
been
the
dollar
and
not
the
man
that
counted
he
has
been
schooled
to
think
that
capital
can
buy
labor
as
it
would
machinery
the
human
equation
not
entering
into
it
he
believes
that
it
would
be
equivalent
to
confiscation
for
the
state
to
say
regard
to
a
corporation
labor
the
state
and
capital
are
important
in
the
order
named
good
man
that
he
means
to
be
he
does
not
know
perhaps
he
can
never
know
that
it
is
labor
labor
of
the
mind
and
of
the
body
that
creates
and
not
capital
you
would
have
a
hard
time
making
father
see
that
put
in
gloria
with
a
smile
yes
continued
philip
from
the
dawn
of
the
world
until
now
it
has
been
the
strong
against
the
weak
at
the
first
in
the
stone
age
it
was
brute
strength
that
counted
and
controlled
then
those
that
ruled
had
leisure
to
grow
intellectually
and
it
gradually
came
about
that
the
many
by
long
centuries
of
oppression
thought
that
the
intellectual
few
had
powers
to
rule
and
to
exact
tribute
from
them
to
the
extent
of
commanding
every
ounce
of
exertion
of
which
their
bodies
were
capable
it
was
here
gloria
that
society
began
to
form
itself
wrongly
and
the
result
is
the
miserable
travesty
of
selfishness
became
the
keynote
and
to
physical
and
mental
strength
was
conceded
everything
that
is
desirable
in
life
later
this
mockery
of
justice
was
partly
recognized
and
it
was
acknowledged
to
be
wrong
for
the
physically
strong
to
despoil
and
destroy
the
physically
weak
so
the
time
is
now
measurably
near
when
it
will
be
just
as
reprehensible
for
the
mentally
strong
to
hold
in
subjection
the
mentally
weak
and
to
force
them
to
bear
the
grievous
burdens
which
a
misconceived
civilization
has
imposed
upon
them
gloria
was
now
thoroughly
interested
but
smilingly
belied
it
by
saying
a
history
professor
i
had
once
lost
his
position
for
talking
like
that
the
young
man
barely
recognized
the
interruption
the
first
gleam
of
hope
came
with
the
advent
of
christ
he
continued
so
warped
and
tangled
had
become
the
minds
of
men
that
the
meaning
of
christ
teaching
failed
utterly
to
reach
human
comprehension
they
accepted
him
as
a
religious
teacher
only
so
far
as
their
selfish
desires
led
them
they
were
willing
to
deny
other
gods
and
admit
one
creator
of
all
things
but
they
split
into
fragments
regarding
the
creeds
and
forms
necessary
to
salvation
in
the
name
of
christ
they
committed
atrocities
that
would
put
to
blush
the
most
benighted
savages
their
very
excesses
in
cruelty
finally
caused
a
revolution
in
feeling
and
there
was
evolved
the
christian
religion
of
a
religion
almost
wholly
selfish
and
concerned
almost
entirely
in
the
betterment
of
life
after
death
the
girl
regarded
philip
for
a
second
in
silence
and
then
quietly
asked
for
the
betterment
of
whose
life
after
death
i
was
speaking
of
those
who
have
carried
on
only
the
forms
of
religion
wrapped
in
the
sanctity
of
their
own
small
circle
they
feel
that
their
tiny
souls
are
safe
and
that
they
are
following
the
example
and
precepts
of
christ
the
full
splendor
of
christ
love
the
grandeur
of
his
life
and
doctrine
is
to
them
a
thing
unknown
the
infinite
love
the
sweet
humility
the
gentle
charity
the
subordination
of
self
that
the
master
came
to
give
a
cruel
selfish
and
ignorant
world
mean
but
little
more
to
us
than
it
did
to
those
to
whom
he
gave
it
and
you
who
have
chosen
a
military
career
say
this
said
the
girl
as
her
brother
joined
the
pair
to
philip
her
comment
came
as
something
of
a
shock
for
he
was
unprepared
for
these
words
spoken
with
such
a
depth
of
feeling
gloria
and
philip
dru
spent
most
of
graduation
day
together
he
did
not
want
to
intrude
amongst
the
relatives
and
friends
of
his
classmates
and
he
was
eager
to
continue
his
acquaintance
with
gloria
to
the
girl
this
youth
who
seemed
so
strangely
out
of
tune
with
the
blatant
military
fanfare
was
a
distinct
novelty
at
the
final
ball
she
almost
ignored
the
gallantries
of
the
young
officers
in
order
that
she
might
have
opportunity
to
lead
dru
on
to
further
the
next
day
in
the
hurry
of
packing
and
departure
he
saw
her
only
for
an
instant
but
from
her
brother
he
learned
that
she
planned
a
visit
to
the
new
post
on
the
rio
grande
near
eagle
pass
where
jack
strawn
and
philip
were
to
be
stationed
after
their
vacation
philip
spent
his
leave
before
he
went
to
the
new
post
at
his
kentucky
home
he
wanted
to
be
with
his
father
and
mother
and
he
wanted
to
read
and
think
so
he
declined
the
many
invitations
to
visit
his
father
was
a
sturdy
farmer
of
fine
natural
sense
and
with
him
philip
never
tired
of
talking
when
both
had
leisure
old
william
dru
had
inherited
nothing
save
a
rundown
badly
managed
heavily
mortgaged
farm
that
had
been
in
the
family
for
several
generations
by
hard
work
and
strict
economy
he
had
first
built
it
up
into
a
productive
property
and
had
then
liquidated
the
indebtedness
so
successful
had
he
been
that
he
was
able
to
buy
small
farms
for
four
of
his
sons
and
give
professional
education
to
the
other
three
he
had
accumulated
nothing
for
he
had
given
as
fast
as
he
had
made
but
his
was
a
serene
and
contented
old
age
because
of
it
what
was
the
hoarding
of
money
or
land
in
comparison
to
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
each
son
happy
in
the
possession
of
a
home
and
family
the
ancestral
farm
he
intended
for
philip
youngest
and
best
beloved
soldier
though
he
was
to
be
all
during
that
hot
summer
philip
and
his
father
discussed
the
unrest
of
the
country
and
speculated
when
the
crisis
would
come
and
how
it
would
end
finally
he
left
his
home
and
all
the
associations
clustered
around
it
and
turned
his
face
towards
imperial
texas
the
field
of
his
new
endeavor
he
reached
fort
magruder
at
the
close
of
an
autumn
day
he
thought
he
had
never
known
such
dry
sweet
air
just
as
the
sun
was
sinking
he
strolled
to
the
bluff
around
which
flowed
the
turbid
waters
of
the
rio
grande
and
looked
across
at
the
gray
hills
of
old
mexico
chapter
iii
lost
in
the
desert
autumn
drifted
into
winter
and
then
with
the
blossoms
of
an
early
spring
came
gloria
the
fort
was
several
miles
from
the
station
and
jack
and
philip
were
there
to
meet
her
as
they
paced
the
little
board
platform
jack
was
nervously
happy
over
the
thought
of
his
sister
arrival
and
talked
of
his
plans
for
entertaining
her
philip
on
the
other
hand
held
himself
well
in
reserve
and
gave
no
outward
indication
of
the
deep
emotion
which
stirred
within
him
at
last
the
train
came
and
from
one
of
the
long
string
of
pullmans
gloria
alighted
she
kissed
her
brother
and
greeted
philip
cordially
and
asked
him
in
a
tone
of
banter
how
he
enjoyed
army
life
dru
smiled
and
said
much
better
gloria
than
you
predicted
i
would
the
baggage
was
stored
away
in
the
and
gloria
got
in
front
with
philip
and
they
were
off
it
was
early
morning
and
the
dew
was
still
on
the
soft
mesquite
grass
and
as
the
mustang
ponies
swiftly
drew
them
over
the
prairie
it
seemed
to
gloria
that
she
had
awakened
in
fairyland
at
the
crest
of
a
hill
philip
held
the
horses
for
a
moment
and
gloria
caught
her
breath
as
she
saw
the
valley
below
it
looked
as
if
some
translucent
lake
had
mirrored
the
sky
it
was
the
countless
blossoms
of
the
texas
that
lifted
their
slender
stems
towards
the
morning
sun
and
hid
the
earth
down
into
the
valley
they
drove
upon
the
most
wonderfully
woven
carpet
in
all
the
world
aladdin
and
his
magic
looms
could
never
have
woven
a
fabric
such
as
this
a
heavy
delicious
perfume
permeated
the
air
and
with
glistening
eyes
and
parted
lips
gloria
sat
dumb
in
happy
astonishment
they
dipped
into
the
rocky
bed
of
a
wet
weather
stream
climbed
out
of
the
canyon
and
found
themselves
within
the
shadow
of
fort
magruder
gloria
soon
saw
that
the
social
distractions
of
the
place
had
little
call
for
philip
she
learned
too
that
he
had
already
won
the
profound
respect
and
liking
of
his
brother
officers
jack
spoke
of
him
in
terms
even
more
superlative
than
ever
he
is
a
born
leader
of
men
he
declared
and
he
knows
more
about
engineering
and
tactics
than
the
colonel
and
all
the
rest
of
us
put
together
hard
student
though
he
was
gloria
found
him
ever
ready
to
devote
himself
to
her
and
their
rides
together
over
the
boundless
flower
studded
prairies
were
a
never
ending
joy
is
it
beautiful
is
it
wonderful
she
would
exclaim
and
once
she
said
but
philip
happy
as
i
am
i
oftentimes
think
of
the
reeking
poverty
in
the
great
cities
and
wish
in
some
way
they
could
share
this
with
me
philip
looked
at
her
questioningly
but
made
no
reply
a
visit
that
was
meant
for
weeks
transgressed
upon
the
months
and
still
she
lingered
one
hot
june
morning
found
gloria
and
philip
far
in
the
hills
on
the
mexican
side
of
the
rio
grande
they
had
started
at
dawn
with
the
intention
of
breakfasting
with
the
courtly
old
haciendado
who
frequently
visited
at
the
post
after
the
ceremonious
mexican
breakfast
gloria
wanted
to
see
beyond
the
rim
of
the
little
world
that
enclosed
the
hacienda
so
they
rode
to
the
end
of
the
valley
tied
their
horses
and
climbed
to
the
crest
of
the
ridge
she
was
eager
to
go
still
further
they
went
down
the
hill
on
the
other
side
through
a
draw
and
into
another
valley
beyond
soldier
though
he
was
philip
was
no
plainsman
and
in
retracing
their
steps
they
missed
the
draw
philip
knew
that
they
were
not
going
as
they
came
but
with
his
months
of
experience
in
the
hills
felt
sure
he
could
find
his
way
back
with
less
trouble
by
continuing
as
they
were
the
grass
and
the
shrubs
gradually
disappeared
as
they
walked
and
soon
he
realized
that
they
were
on
the
edge
of
an
alkali
desert
still
he
thought
he
could
swing
around
into
the
valley
from
which
they
started
and
they
plunged
steadily
on
only
to
see
in
a
few
minutes
that
they
were
lost
what
the
matter
philip
asked
gloria
are
we
lost
i
hope
not
we
only
have
to
find
that
draw
the
girl
said
no
more
but
walked
on
side
by
side
with
the
young
soldier
both
pulled
their
hats
far
down
over
their
eyes
to
shield
them
from
the
glare
of
the
fierce
rays
of
the
sun
and
did
what
they
could
to
keep
out
the
choking
clouds
of
alkali
dust
that
swirled
around
them
at
every
step
philip
hardened
by
months
of
southwestern
service
stood
the
heat
well
except
that
his
eyes
ached
but
he
saw
that
gloria
was
giving
out
are
you
tired
he
asked
yes
i
am
very
tired
she
answered
but
i
can
go
on
if
you
will
let
me
rest
a
moment
her
voice
was
weak
and
uncertain
and
indicated
approaching
collapse
and
then
she
said
more
faintly
i
am
afraid
philip
we
are
hopelessly
lost
do
not
be
frightened
gloria
we
will
soon
be
out
of
this
if
you
will
let
me
carry
you
just
then
the
girl
staggered
and
would
have
fallen
had
he
not
caught
her
he
was
familiar
with
heat
prostration
and
saw
that
her
condition
was
not
serious
but
he
knew
he
must
carry
her
for
to
lay
her
in
the
blazing
sun
would
be
fatal
his
eyes
already
overworked
by
long
hours
of
study
were
swollen
and
bloodshot
sharp
pains
shot
through
his
head
to
stop
he
feared
would
be
to
court
death
so
taking
gloria
in
his
arms
he
staggered
on
in
that
vast
world
of
alkali
and
adobe
there
was
no
living
thing
but
these
two
no
air
was
astir
and
a
pitiless
sun
beat
upon
them
unmercifully
philip
lips
were
cracked
his
tongue
was
swollen
and
the
burning
dust
almost
choked
him
he
began
to
see
less
clearly
and
visions
of
things
he
knew
to
be
unreal
came
to
him
with
spartan
courage
and
indomitable
will
he
never
faltered
but
went
on
mirages
came
and
went
and
he
could
not
know
whether
he
saw
true
or
not
then
here
and
there
he
thought
he
began
to
see
tufts
of
curly
mesquite
grass
and
in
the
distance
surely
there
were
cacti
he
knew
that
if
he
could
hold
out
a
little
longer
he
could
lay
his
burden
in
some
sort
of
shade
with
halting
steps
with
eyes
inflamed
and
strength
all
but
gone
he
finally
laid
gloria
in
the
shadow
of
a
giant
prickly
pear
bush
and
fell
beside
her
he
fumbled
for
his
knife
and
clumsily
scraped
the
needles
from
a
leaf
of
the
cactus
and
sliced
it
in
two
the
heavy
sticky
liquid
ran
over
his
hand
as
he
placed
the
cut
side
of
the
leaf
to
lips
the
juice
of
the
plant
together
with
the
shade
partially
revived
her
philip
too
sucked
the
leaf
until
his
parched
tongue
and
throat
became
a
little
more
pliable
what
happened
demanded
gloria
oh
yes
now
i
remember
i
am
sorry
i
gave
out
philip
i
am
not
acclimated
yet
what
time
is
it
after
pillowing
her
head
more
comfortably
upon
his
riding
coat
philip
looked
at
his
watch
i
i
ca
just
make
it
out
gloria
he
said
my
eyes
seem
blurred
this
awful
glare
seems
to
have
affected
them
be
all
right
in
a
little
while
gloria
looked
at
the
dial
and
found
that
the
hands
pointed
to
four
they
had
been
lost
for
six
hours
but
after
their
experiences
it
seemed
more
like
as
many
days
they
rested
a
little
while
longer
talking
but
little
you
carried
me
said
gloria
once
i
ashamed
of
myself
for
letting
the
heat
get
the
best
of
me
you
should
have
carried
me
philip
but
you
know
i
understand
and
appreciate
how
are
your
eyes
now
oh
they
be
all
right
he
reiterated
but
when
he
took
his
hand
from
them
to
look
at
her
and
the
light
beat
upon
the
inflamed
lids
he
winced
after
eating
some
of
the
fruit
of
the
prickly
pear
which
they
found
too
hot
and
sweet
to
be
palatable
philip
suggested
at
half
after
five
that
they
should
move
on
they
arose
and
the
young
officer
started
to
lead
the
way
peeping
from
beneath
his
hand
first
he
stumbled
over
a
mesquite
bush
directly
in
his
path
and
next
he
collided
with
a
giant
cactus
standing
full
in
front
of
him
it
no
use
gloria
he
said
at
last
i
ca
see
the
way
you
must
lead
all
right
philip
i
will
do
the
best
i
can
for
answer
he
merely
took
her
hand
and
together
they
started
to
retrace
their
steps
over
the
trackless
waste
of
alkali
and
sagebrush
they
trudged
they
spoke
but
little
but
when
they
did
their
husky
voices
made
a
mockery
of
their
hopeful
words
though
the
horizon
seemed
bounded
by
a
low
range
of
hills
the
girl
instinctively
turned
her
steps
westward
and
entered
a
draw
she
rounded
one
of
the
hills
and
just
as
the
sun
was
sinking
came
upon
the
valley
in
which
their
horses
were
peacefully
grazing
they
mounted
and
followed
the
dim
trail
along
which
they
had
ridden
that
morning
reaching
the
hacienda
about
dark
with
many
shakings
of
the
hand
voluble
protestations
of
joy
at
their
delivery
from
the
desert
and
callings
on
god
to
witness
that
the
girl
had
performed
a
miracle
the
haciendado
gave
them
food
and
cooling
drinks
and
with
gentle
insistence
had
his
servants
wife
and
daughters
show
them
to
their
rooms
a
poultice
of
mexican
herbs
was
laid
across
philip
eyes
but
exhausted
as
he
was
he
could
not
sleep
because
of
the
pain
they
caused
him
in
the
morning
gloria
was
almost
her
usual
self
but
philip
could
see
but
faintly
as
early
as
was
possible
they
started
for
fort
magruder
his
eyes
were
bandaged
and
gloria
held
the
bridle
of
his
horse
and
led
him
along
the
dusty
trail
a
vaquero
from
the
ranch
went
with
them
to
show
the
way
then
came
days
of
anxiety
for
the
surgeon
at
the
post
saw
serious
trouble
ahead
for
philip
he
would
make
no
definite
statement
but
admitted
that
the
brilliant
young
officer
eyesight
was
seriously
menaced
gloria
read
to
him
and
wrote
for
him
and
in
many
ways
was
his
hands
and
eyes
he
in
turn
talked
to
her
of
the
things
that
filled
his
mind
the
betterment
of
man
was
an
theme
with
them
it
pleased
him
to
trace
for
her
the
world
history
from
its
early
beginning
when
all
was
misty
tradition
down
through
the
uncertain
centuries
of
early
civilization
to
the
present
time
he
talked
with
her
of
the
untrustworthiness
of
the
history
of
although
we
had
every
facility
for
recording
facts
and
he
pointed
out
how
utterly
unreliable
it
was
when
tradition
was
the
only
means
of
transmission
mediocrity
he
felt
sure
had
oftentimes
been
exalted
into
genius
and
brilliant
and
patriotic
exclamations
attributed
to
great
men
were
never
uttered
by
them
neither
was
it
easy
he
thought
to
get
a
true
historic
picture
of
the
human
intellectual
giant
as
a
rule
they
were
quite
human
but
people
insisted
upon
idealizing
them
consequently
they
became
not
themselves
but
what
the
popular
mind
wanted
them
to
be
he
also
dwelt
on
the
part
the
demagogue
and
the
incompetents
play
in
retarding
the
advancement
of
the
human
race
some
leaders
were
honest
some
were
wise
and
some
were
selfish
but
it
was
seldom
that
the
people
would
be
led
by
wise
honest
and
unselfish
men
there
is
always
the
demagogue
to
poison
the
mind
of
the
people
against
such
a
man
he
said
and
it
is
easily
done
because
wisdom
means
moderation
and
honesty
means
truth
to
be
moderate
and
to
tell
the
truth
at
all
times
and
about
all
matters
seldom
pleases
the
masses
many
a
long
day
was
spent
thus
in
purely
impersonal
discussions
of
affairs
and
though
he
himself
did
not
realize
it
gloria
saw
that
philip
was
ever
at
his
best
when
viewing
the
large
questions
of
state
rather
than
the
narrower
ones
within
the
scope
of
the
military
power
the
weeks
passed
swiftly
for
the
girl
knew
well
how
to
ease
the
young
officer
chafing
at
uncertainty
and
inaction
at
times
as
they
droned
away
the
long
hot
summer
afternoons
under
the
heavily
leafed
fig
trees
in
the
little
garden
of
the
strawn
bungalow
he
would
become
impatient
at
his
enforced
idleness
finally
one
day
after
making
a
pitiful
attempt
to
read
philip
broke
out
i
have
been
patient
under
this
as
long
as
i
can
the
restraint
is
too
much
something
must
be
done
somewhat
to
his
surprise
gloria
did
not
try
to
take
his
mind
off
the
situation
this
time
but
suggested
asking
the
surgeon
for
a
definite
report
on
his
condition
the
interview
with
the
surgeon
was
unsatisfactory
but
his
report
to
his
superior
officers
bore
fruit
for
in
a
short
time
philip
was
told
that
he
should
apply
for
an
indefinite
leave
of
absence
as
it
would
be
months
perhaps
years
before
his
eyes
would
allow
him
to
carry
on
his
duties
he
seemed
dazed
at
the
news
and
for
a
long
time
would
not
talk
of
it
even
with
gloria
after
a
long
silence
one
afternoon
she
softly
asked
what
are
you
going
to
do
philip
jack
strawn
who
was
sitting
near
by
broke
out
do
why
there
no
question
about
what
he
is
going
to
do
once
an
army
man
always
an
army
man
he
going
to
live
on
the
best
the
provides
until
his
eyes
are
right
in
the
meantime
philip
is
going
to
take
indefinite
sick
leave
the
girl
only
smiled
at
her
brother
military
point
of
view
and
asked
another
question
how
will
you
occupy
your
time
philip
philip
sat
as
if
he
had
not
heard
them
occupy
his
time
exclaimed
jack
getting
well
of
course
without
having
to
obey
orders
or
do
anything
but
draw
his
checks
he
can
have
the
time
of
his
life
there
will
be
nothing
to
worry
about
that
just
it
slowly
said
philip
no
work
nothing
to
think
about
exactly
said
gloria
what
are
you
driving
at
sister
you
talk
as
if
it
was
something
to
be
deplored
i
call
it
a
lark
cheer
the
fellow
up
a
bit
ca
you
no
never
mind
replied
philip
there
nothing
to
cheer
me
up
about
the
question
is
simply
this
can
i
stand
a
period
of
several
enforced
inactivity
as
a
mere
pensioner
yes
quickly
said
gloria
as
a
pensioner
and
then
if
all
goes
well
you
return
to
this
what
do
you
mean
gloria
do
you
like
army
post
life
asked
jack
i
like
it
as
well
as
you
do
jack
you
just
have
come
to
realize
that
philip
is
cut
out
for
a
bigger
sphere
than
that
she
pointed
out
across
the
parade
ground
where
a
drill
was
going
on
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
this
is
not
the
age
for
a
military
career
jack
was
so
disgusted
with
this
that
with
an
exclamation
of
impatience
he
abruptly
strode
off
to
the
parade
ground
you
are
right
gloria
said
philip
i
can
not
live
on
a
pension
indefinitely
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
believe
that
it
is
honest
to
become
a
mendicant
upon
the
bounty
of
the
country
if
i
had
been
injured
in
the
performance
of
duty
i
would
have
no
scruples
in
accepting
support
during
an
enforced
idleness
but
this
disability
arose
from
no
fault
of
the
government
and
the
thought
of
accepting
aid
under
such
circumstances
is
too
repugnant
of
course
said
gloria
the
government
means
no
more
to
me
than
an
individual
continued
philip
and
it
is
to
be
as
fairly
dealt
with
i
never
could
understand
how
men
with
could
accept
undeserving
pensions
from
the
nation
to
do
so
is
not
alone
dishonest
but
is
unfair
to
those
who
need
help
and
have
a
righteous
claim
to
support
if
the
unworthy
were
refused
the
deserving
would
be
able
to
obtain
that
to
which
they
are
entitled
their
talk
went
on
thus
for
hours
the
girl
ever
trying
more
particularly
to
make
him
see
a
military
career
as
she
did
and
he
more
concerned
with
the
ethical
side
of
the
situation
do
not
worry
over
it
philip
cried
gloria
i
feel
sure
that
your
place
is
in
the
larger
world
of
affairs
and
you
will
some
day
be
glad
that
this
misfortune
came
to
you
and
that
you
were
forced
to
go
into
another
field
of
endeavor
with
my
ignorance
and
idle
curiosity
i
led
you
on
and
on
over
first
one
hill
and
then
another
until
you
lost
your
way
in
that
awful
desert
over
there
but
yet
perhaps
there
was
a
destiny
in
that
when
i
was
leading
you
out
of
the
desert
a
blind
man
it
may
be
that
i
was
leading
you
out
of
the
barrenness
of
military
life
into
the
fruitful
field
of
labor
for
humanity
after
a
long
silence
philip
dru
arose
and
took
gloria
hand
yes
i
will
resign
you
have
already
reconciled
me
to
my
fate
chapter
iv
the
supremacy
of
mind
officers
and
friends
urged
philip
to
reconsider
his
determination
of
resigning
but
once
decided
he
could
not
be
swerved
from
his
purpose
gloria
persuaded
him
to
go
to
new
york
with
her
in
order
to
consult
one
of
the
leading
oculists
and
arrangements
were
made
immediately
on
the
last
day
but
one
as
they
sat
under
their
favorite
fig
tree
they
talked
much
of
philip
future
gloria
had
also
been
reading
aloud
sir
oliver
lodge
science
and
immortality
and
closing
the
book
upon
the
final
chapter
asked
philip
what
he
thought
of
it
although
the
book
was
written
many
years
ago
even
then
the
truth
had
begun
to
dawn
upon
the
poets
seers
and
scientific
dreamers
the
dominion
of
mind
but
faintly
seen
at
that
time
but
more
clearly
now
will
finally
come
into
full
vision
the
materialists
under
the
leadership
of
darwin
huxley
and
wallace
went
far
in
the
right
direction
but
in
trying
to
go
to
the
very
fountainhead
of
life
they
came
to
a
door
which
they
could
not
open
and
which
no
materialistic
key
will
ever
open
so
mr
preacher
you
at
it
again
laughed
gloria
you
belong
to
the
pulpit
of
real
life
not
the
army
go
on
i
am
interested
well
went
on
dru
then
came
a
reaction
and
the
best
thought
of
the
scientific
world
swung
back
to
the
theory
of
mind
or
spirit
and
the
truth
began
to
unfold
itself
now
man
is
at
last
about
to
enter
into
that
splendid
kingdom
the
promise
of
which
christ
gave
us
when
he
said
father
and
i
are
one
and
again
you
have
seen
me
you
have
seen
the
father
he
was
but
telling
them
that
all
life
was
a
part
of
the
one
life
individualized
but
yet
of
and
a
part
of
the
whole
we
are
just
learning
our
power
and
dominion
over
ourselves
when
in
the
future
children
are
trained
from
infancy
that
they
can
measurably
conquer
their
troubles
by
the
force
of
mind
a
new
era
will
have
come
to
man
there
said
gloria
with
an
earnestness
that
philip
had
rarely
heard
in
her
is
perhaps
the
source
of
the
true
redemption
of
the
world
she
checked
herself
quickly
but
you
were
preaching
to
me
not
i
to
you
go
on
no
but
i
want
to
hear
what
you
were
going
to
say
you
see
i
am
greatly
interested
in
this
movement
which
is
seeking
to
find
how
far
mind
controls
matter
and
to
what
extent
our
lives
are
spiritual
rather
than
material
she
answered
but
it
hard
to
talk
about
it
to
most
people
so
i
have
kept
it
to
myself
go
on
philip
i
will
not
interrupt
again
when
fear
hate
greed
and
the
purely
material
conception
of
life
passes
out
said
philip
as
it
some
day
may
and
only
wholesome
thoughts
will
have
a
place
in
human
minds
mental
ills
will
take
flight
along
with
most
of
our
bodily
ills
and
the
miracle
of
the
redemption
will
have
been
largely
wrought
mental
ills
will
take
flight
along
with
bodily
ills
we
should
be
trained
too
not
to
dwell
upon
anticipated
troubles
but
to
use
our
minds
and
bodies
in
an
earnest
honest
endeavor
to
avert
threatened
disaster
we
should
not
brood
over
possible
failure
for
in
the
great
realm
of
the
supremacy
of
mind
or
spirit
the
thought
of
failure
should
not
enter
yes
i
know
philip
fear
causes
perhaps
more
unhappiness
than
any
one
thing
that
we
have
let
take
possession
of
us
some
are
never
free
from
it
they
awake
in
the
morning
with
a
vague
indefinite
sense
of
it
and
at
night
a
foreboding
of
disaster
hands
over
the
life
would
have
for
us
a
different
meaning
if
we
would
resolve
and
keep
the
resolution
to
do
the
best
we
could
under
all
conditions
and
never
fear
the
result
then
too
we
should
be
trained
not
to
have
such
an
unreasonable
fear
of
death
the
eastern
peoples
are
far
wiser
in
this
respect
than
we
they
have
learned
to
look
upon
death
as
a
happy
transition
to
something
better
and
they
are
right
for
that
is
the
true
philosophy
of
it
at
the
very
worst
can
it
mean
more
than
a
long
and
dreamless
sleep
does
not
the
soul
either
go
back
to
the
one
source
from
which
it
sprung
and
become
a
part
of
the
whole
or
does
it
not
throw
off
its
material
environment
and
continue
with
individual
consciousness
to
work
out
its
final
destiny
if
that
be
true
there
is
no
death
as
we
have
conceived
it
it
would
mean
to
us
merely
the
beginning
of
a
more
splendid
day
and
we
should
be
taught
that
every
emotion
every
effort
here
that
is
unselfish
and
soul
uplifting
will
better
fit
us
for
that
spiritual
existence
that
is
to
come
chapter
v
the
tragedy
of
the
turners
the
trip
north
from
fort
magruder
was
a
most
trying
experience
for
philip
dru
for
although
he
had
as
traveling
companions
gloria
and
jack
strawn
who
was
taking
a
leave
of
absence
the
young
kentuckian
felt
his
departure
from
texas
and
the
army
as
a
portentous
turning
point
in
his
career
in
spite
of
gloria
philosophy
and
in
spite
of
reassurances
philip
was
assailed
by
doubts
as
to
the
ultimate
improvement
of
his
eyesight
and
at
the
same
time
with
the
feeling
that
perhaps
after
all
he
was
playing
the
part
of
a
deserter
it
all
nonsense
to
feel
cut
up
over
it
you
know
philip
insisted
jack
you
can
take
my
word
for
it
that
you
have
the
wrong
idea
in
wanting
to
quit
when
you
can
be
taken
care
of
by
the
government
you
have
every
right
to
it
no
jack
i
have
no
right
to
it
answered
dru
but
certain
as
i
am
that
i
am
doing
the
only
thing
i
could
do
under
the
circumstances
a
hard
wrench
to
leave
the
army
even
though
i
had
come
to
think
that
i
can
find
my
place
in
the
world
out
of
the
service
the
depression
was
not
shaken
off
until
after
they
had
reached
new
york
and
philip
had
been
told
by
the
great
specialist
that
his
eyesight
probably
never
again
would
pass
the
army
tests
once
convinced
that
an
army
career
was
impossible
he
resigned
and
began
to
reconstruct
his
life
with
new
hope
and
with
a
new
enthusiasm
while
he
was
ordered
to
give
his
eyes
complete
rest
for
at
least
six
months
and
remain
a
part
of
every
day
in
a
darkened
room
he
was
promised
that
after
several
months
he
probably
would
be
able
to
read
and
write
a
little
as
he
had
no
relatives
in
new
york
philip
after
some
hesitation
accepted
jack
strawn
insistent
invitation
to
visit
him
for
a
time
at
least
through
the
long
days
and
weeks
that
followed
the
former
young
officer
and
gloria
were
thrown
much
together
one
afternoon
as
they
were
sitting
in
a
park
a
pallid
child
of
ten
asked
to
shine
their
shoes
in
sympathy
they
allowed
him
to
do
it
the
little
fellow
had
a
gaunt
and
hungry
look
and
his
movements
were
very
sluggish
he
said
his
name
was
peter
turner
and
he
gave
some
squalid
east
side
tenement
district
as
his
home
he
said
that
his
father
was
dead
his
mother
was
bedridden
and
he
the
oldest
of
three
children
was
the
only
support
of
the
family
he
got
up
at
five
and
prepared
their
simple
meal
and
did
what
he
could
towards
making
his
mother
comfortable
for
the
day
by
six
he
left
the
one
room
that
sheltered
them
and
walked
more
than
two
miles
to
where
he
now
was
midday
meal
he
had
none
and
in
the
late
afternoon
he
walked
home
and
arranged
their
supper
of
bread
potatoes
or
whatever
else
he
considered
he
could
afford
to
buy
philip
questioned
him
as
to
his
earnings
and
was
told
that
they
varied
with
the
weather
and
other
conditions
the
maximum
had
been
a
dollar
and
fifteen
cents
for
one
day
the
minimum
twenty
cents
the
average
seemed
around
fifty
cents
and
this
was
to
shelter
clothe
and
feed
a
family
of
four
already
gloria
eyes
were
dimmed
with
tears
philip
asked
if
they
might
go
home
with
him
then
the
child
consented
and
led
the
way
they
had
not
gone
far
when
philip
noticing
how
frail
peter
was
hailed
a
car
and
they
rode
to
grand
street
changed
there
and
went
east
midway
between
the
bowery
and
the
river
they
got
out
and
walked
south
for
a
few
blocks
turned
into
a
side
street
that
was
hardly
more
than
an
alley
and
came
to
the
tenement
where
peter
lived
it
had
been
a
hot
day
even
in
the
wide
clean
portions
of
the
city
here
the
heat
was
almost
unbearable
and
the
stench
incident
to
a
congested
population
made
matters
worse
ragged
and
dirty
children
were
playing
in
the
street
lack
of
food
and
pure
air
together
with
unsanitary
surroundings
had
set
its
mark
upon
them
the
deathly
pallor
that
was
in
peter
face
was
characteristic
of
most
of
the
faces
around
them
the
visitors
climbed
four
flights
of
stairs
and
went
down
a
long
dark
narrow
hall
reeking
with
disagreeable
odors
and
finally
entered
peter
turner
home
what
a
travesty
on
the
word
murmured
dru
as
he
saw
for
the
first
time
the
interior
of
an
east
side
tenement
turner
lay
propped
in
bed
a
ghost
of
what
was
once
a
comely
woman
she
was
barely
thirty
yet
poverty
disease
and
the
city
had
drawn
their
cruel
lines
across
her
face
gloria
went
to
her
bedside
and
gently
pressed
the
fragile
hand
she
dared
not
trust
herself
to
speak
and
this
she
thought
is
within
the
shadow
of
my
home
and
i
never
knew
oh
god
she
silently
prayed
forgive
us
for
our
neglect
of
such
as
these
gloria
and
philip
did
all
that
was
possible
for
the
turners
but
their
helping
hands
came
too
late
to
do
more
than
to
give
the
mother
a
measure
of
peace
during
the
last
days
of
her
life
the
promise
of
help
for
the
children
lifted
a
heavy
load
from
her
heart
poor
stricken
soul
zelda
turner
deserved
a
better
fate
when
she
married
len
turner
life
seemed
full
of
joy
he
was
employed
in
the
office
of
a
large
manufacturing
concern
at
what
seemed
to
them
a
munificent
salary
dollars
a
month
those
were
happy
days
how
they
saved
and
planned
for
the
future
the
castle
that
they
built
in
spain
was
a
little
home
on
a
small
farm
near
a
city
large
enough
to
be
a
profitable
market
for
their
produce
some
place
where
the
children
could
get
fresh
air
wholesome
food
and
a
place
in
which
to
grow
up
two
thousand
dollars
saved
would
they
thought
be
enough
to
make
the
start
with
this
a
farm
costing
four
thousand
dollars
could
be
bought
by
mortgaging
it
for
half
dollars
a
month
saved
for
six
years
would
with
interest
bring
them
to
their
goal
already
more
than
half
the
sum
was
theirs
then
came
disaster
one
sunday
they
were
out
for
their
usual
walk
it
had
been
sleeting
and
the
pavements
here
and
there
were
still
icy
in
front
of
them
some
children
were
playing
and
a
little
girl
of
eight
darted
into
the
street
to
avoid
being
caught
by
a
companion
she
slipped
and
fell
a
heavy
motor
was
almost
upon
her
when
len
rushed
to
snatch
her
from
the
car
he
caught
the
child
but
slipped
himself
succeeding
however
in
pushing
her
beyond
danger
before
the
cruel
wheels
crushed
out
his
life
the
dreary
days
and
nights
that
followed
need
not
be
recited
here
the
cost
of
the
funeral
and
other
expenses
incident
thereto
bit
deep
into
their
savings
therefore
as
soon
as
she
could
pull
herself
together
turner
sought
employment
and
got
it
in
a
large
dressmaking
establishment
at
the
inadequate
wage
of
seven
dollars
a
week
she
was
skillful
with
her
needle
but
had
no
aptitude
for
design
therefore
she
was
ever
to
be
among
the
plodders
one
night
in
the
busy
season
of
overwork
before
the
christmas
holidays
she
started
to
walk
the
ten
blocks
to
her
little
home
for
was
a
tax
beyond
her
purse
and
losing
her
weary
footing
she
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
by
the
aid
of
a
kindly
policeman
she
was
able
to
reach
home
in
great
suffering
only
to
faint
when
she
finally
reached
her
room
peter
who
was
then
about
seven
years
old
was
badly
frightened
he
ran
for
their
next
door
neighbor
a
kindly
german
woman
she
lifted
zelda
into
bed
and
sent
for
a
physician
and
although
he
could
find
no
other
injury
than
a
badly
bruised
spine
she
never
left
her
bed
until
she
was
borne
to
her
grave
the
pitiful
little
sum
that
was
saved
soon
went
and
peter
with
his
blacking
box
became
the
sole
support
of
the
family
when
they
had
buried
zelda
and
gloria
was
kneeling
by
her
grave
softly
weeping
philip
touched
her
shoulder
and
said
let
us
go
she
needs
us
no
longer
but
there
are
those
who
do
this
experience
has
been
my
lesson
and
from
now
it
is
my
purpose
to
consecrate
my
life
towards
the
betterment
of
such
as
these
our
thoughts
our
habits
our
morals
our
civilization
itself
is
wrong
else
it
would
not
be
possible
for
just
this
sort
of
suffering
to
exist
but
you
will
let
me
help
you
philip
said
gloria
it
will
mean
much
to
me
gloria
if
you
will
in
this
instance
len
turner
died
a
hero
death
and
when
turner
became
incapacitated
society
the
state
call
it
what
you
will
should
have
stepped
in
and
thrown
its
protecting
arms
around
her
it
was
never
intended
that
she
should
lie
there
day
after
day
month
after
month
suffering
starving
and
in
an
agony
of
soul
for
her
children
future
she
had
the
right
to
expect
succor
from
the
rich
and
the
strong
yes
said
gloria
i
have
heard
successful
men
and
women
say
that
they
can
not
help
the
poor
that
if
you
gave
them
all
you
had
they
would
soon
be
poor
again
and
that
your
giving
would
never
cease
i
know
philip
replied
that
is
ever
the
cry
of
the
selfish
they
believe
that
they
merit
all
the
blessings
of
health
distinction
and
wealth
that
may
come
to
them
and
they
condemn
their
less
fortunate
brother
as
one
deserving
his
fate
the
poor
the
weak
and
the
impractical
did
not
themselves
bring
about
their
condition
who
knows
how
large
a
part
the
mystery
of
birth
and
heredity
play
in
one
life
and
what
environment
and
opportunity
or
lack
of
it
means
to
us
health
ability
energy
favorable
environment
and
opportunity
are
the
ingredients
of
success
success
is
graduated
by
the
lack
of
one
or
all
of
these
if
the
powerful
use
their
strength
merely
to
further
their
own
selfish
desires
in
what
way
save
in
degree
do
they
differ
from
the
lower
animals
of
creation
and
how
can
man
under
such
a
moral
code
justify
his
dominion
over
land
and
sea
until
recently
this
question
has
never
squarely
faced
the
human
race
but
it
does
face
it
now
and
to
its
glory
and
honor
it
is
going
to
be
answered
right
the
strong
will
help
the
weak
the
rich
will
share
with
the
poor
and
it
will
not
be
called
charity
but
it
will
be
known
as
justice
and
the
man
or
woman
who
fails
to
do
his
duty
not
as
he
sees
it
but
as
society
at
large
sees
it
will
be
held
up
to
the
contempt
of
mankind
a
generation
or
two
ago
gloria
this
mad
unreasoning

and
to
the
advancement

but
here
and
there
was
found
a
man
gifted
beyond
his
fellows
one
with
vision
clear
enough
to
distinguish
things
worth

and
these
scorning
to
acquire
either
wealth
or

labored
diligently
in
their
separate
fields
of

one
such
became
a
great
educator
the
greatest
of
his
day
and
generation
and
by
his
long
life
of
rectitude
set
an
example
to
the
youth
of

that
has
done
more
good
than

a
prodigious
physical
undertaking
for
no
further
reason
than
that
he
might
serve
his
country
where
best
he
could
he
went
into

dug

chapter
vi
the
prophet
of
a
new
day
philip
and
strawn
oftentimes
discussed
the
mental
and
moral
upheaval
that
was
now
generally
in
evidence
what
is
to
be
the
outcome
philip
said
strawn
i
know
that
things
are
not
as
they
should
be
but
how
can
there
be
a
more
even
distribution
of
wealth
without
lessening
the
efficiency
of
the
strong
able
and
energetic
men
and
without
making
mendicants
of
the
indolent
and
improvident
if
we
had
pure
socialism
we
could
never
get
the
highest
endeavor
out
of
anyone
for
it
would
seem
not
worth
while
to
do
more
than
the
average
the
race
would
then
go
backward
instead
of
lifting
itself
higher
by
the
insistent
desire
to
excel
and
to
reap
the
rich
reward
that
comes
with
success
in
the
past
strawn
your
contention
would
be
unanswerable
but
the
moral
tone
and
thought
of
the
world
is
changing
you
take
it
for
granted
that
man
must
have
in
sight
some
material
reward
in
order
to
bring
forth
the
best
there
is
within
him
i
believe
that
mankind
is
awakening
to
the
fact
that
material
compensation
is
far
less
to
be
desired
than
spiritual
compensation
this
feeling
will
grow
it
is
growing
and
when
it
comes
to
full
fruition
the
world
will
find
but
little
difficulty
in
attaining
a
certain
measure
of
altruism
i
agree
with
you
that
this
desired
state
of
society
can
not
be
altogether
reached
by
laws
however
drastic
socialism
as
dreamed
of
by
karl
marx
can
not
be
entirely
brought
about
by
a
comprehensive
system
of
state
ownership
and
by
the
leveling
of
wealth
if
that
were
done
without
a
spiritual
leavening
the
result
would
be
largely
as
you
suggest
and
so
the
discussion
ran
strawn
the
embodiment
of
the
old
order
of
thought
and
habit
and
philip
the
apostle
of
the
new
and
gloria
listened
and
felt
that
in
philip
a
new
force
had
arisen
she
likened
him
to
a
young
eagle
who
soaring
high
above
a
slumbering
world
sees
first
the
gleaming
rays
of
that
onrushing
sun
that
is
soon
to
make
another
day
chapter
vii
the
winning
of
a
medal
it
had
become
the
practice
of
the
war
department
to
present
to
the
army
every
five
years
a
comprehensive
military
problem
involving
an
imaginary
attack
upon
this
country
by
a
powerful
foreign
foe
and
the
proper
line
of
defense
the
competition
was
open
to
both
officers
and
men
a
medal
was
given
to
the
successful
contestant
and
much
distinction
came
with
it
there
had
been
as
yet
but
one
contest
five
years
before
the
medal
had
been
won
by
a
major
general
who
by
wide
acclaim
was
considered
the
greatest
military
authority
in
the
army
that
he
should
win
seemed
to
accord
with
the
fitness
of
things
and
it
was
thought
that
he
would
again
be
successful
the
problem
had
been
given
to
the
army
on
the
first
of
november
and
six
months
were
allowed
to
study
it
and
hand
in
a
written
dissertation
thereon
it
was
arranged
that
the
general
military
staff
that
considered
the
papers
should
not
know
the
names
of
the
contestants
philip
had
worked
upon
the
matter
assiduously
while
he
was
at
fort
magruder
and
had
sent
in
his
paper
early
in
march
great
was
his
surprise
upon
receiving
a
telegram
from
the
secretary
of
war
announcing
that
he
had
won
the
medal
for
a
few
days
he
was
a
national
sensation
the
distinction
of
the
first
winner
who
was
again
a
contestant
and
philip
youth
and
obscurity
made
such
a
striking
contrast
that
the
whole
situation
appealed
enormously
to
the
imagination
of
the
people
then
too
the
problem
was
one
of
unusual
interest
and
it
as
well
as
philip
masterly
treatment
of
it
was
published
far
and
wide
the
nation
was
clearly
treating
itself
to
a
sensation
and
upon
philip
were
focused
the
eyes
of
all
from
now
he
was
a
marked
man
the
president
stirred
by
the
wishes
of
a
large
part
of
the
people
expressed
by
them
in
divers
ways
offered
him
reinstatement
in
the
army
with
the
rank
of
major
and
indicated
through
the
secretary
of
war
that
he
would
be
assigned
as
secretary
to
the
general
staff
it
was
a
gracious
thing
to
do
even
though
it
was
prompted
by
that
political
instinct
for
which
the
president
had
become
justly
famous
in
an
appreciative
note
of
thanks
philip
declined
again
he
became
the
talk
of
the
hour
poor
and
until
now
obscure
it
was
assumed
that
he
would
gladly
seize
such
an
opportunity
for
a
brilliant
career
within
his
profession
his
friends
were
amazed
and
urged
him
to
reconsider
the
matter
but
his
determination
was
fixed
only
gloria
understood
and
approved
philip
said
strawn
do
not
turn
this
offer
down
lightly
such
an
opportunity
seldom
comes
twice
in
any
man
life
i
am
deeply
impressed
with
the
truth
of
what
you
say
strawn
and
i
am
not
putting
aside
a
military
career
without
much
regret
however
i
am
now
committed
to
a
life
work
of
a
different
character
one
in
which
glory
and
success
as
the
world
knows
it
can
never
enter
but
which
appeals
to
every
instinct
that
i
possess
i
have
turned
my
face
in
the
one
direction
and
come
what
may
i
shall
never
change
i
am
afraid
philip
that
in
the
enthusiasm
of
youth
and
inexperience
you
are
doing
a
foolish
thing
one
that
will
bring
you
many
hours
of
bitter
regret
this
is
the
parting
of
the
ways
with
you
take
the
advice
of
one
who
loves
you
well
and
turn
into
the
road
leading
to
honor
and
success
the
path
which
you
are
about
to
choose
is
obscure
and
difficult
and
none
may
say
just
where
it
leads
what
you
say
is
true
strawn
only
we
are
measuring
results
by
different
standards
if
i
could
journey
your
road
with
a
blythe
heart
free
from
regret
when
glory
and
honor
came
i
should
revel
in
it
and
die
perhaps
happy
and
contented
but
constituted
as
i
am
when
i
began
to
travel
along
that
road
from
its
dust
there
would
arise
to
haunt
me
the
ghosts
of
those
of
my
fellowmen
who
had
lived
and
died
without
opportunity
the
cold
and
hungry
the
sick
and
suffering
poor
would
seem
to
cry
to
me
that
i
had
abandoned
them
in
order
that
i
might
achieve
distinction
and
success
and
there
would
be
for
me
no
peace
and
here
gloria
touched
his
hand
with
hers
that
he
might
know
her
thoughts
and
sympathy
were
at
one
with
his
philip
was
human
enough
to
feel
a
glow
of
satisfaction
at
having
achieved
so
much
reputation
a
large
part
of
it
he
felt
was
undeserved
and
rather
hysterical
but
that
he
had
been
able
to
do
a
big
thing
made
him
surer
of
his
ground
in
his
new
field
of
endeavor
he
believed
too
that
it
would
aid
him
largely
in
obtaining
the
confidence
of
those
with
whom
he
expected
to
work
and
of
those
he
expected
to
work
for
chapter
viii
the
story
of
the
levinskys
as
soon
as
public
attention
was
brought
to
philip
in
such
a
generous
way
he
received
many
offers
to
write
for
the
press
and
magazines
and
also
to
lecture
he
did
not
wish
to
draw
upon
his
father
slender
resources
and
yet
he
must
needs
do
something
to
meet
his
living
expenses
for
during
the
months
of
his
inactivity
he
had
drawn
largely
upon
the
small
sum
which
he
had
saved
from
his
salary
the
strawns
were
insistent
that
he
should
continue
to
make
their
home
his
own
but
this
he
was
unwilling
to
do
so
he
rented
an
inexpensive
room
over
a
small
hardware
store
in
the
east
side
tenement
district
he
thought
of
getting
in
one
of
the
big
tenement
houses
so
that
he
might
live
as
those
he
came
to
help
lived
but
he
abandoned
this
because
he
feared
he
might
become
too
absorbed
in
those
immediately
around
him
what
he
wanted
was
a
broader
view
his
purpose
was
not
so
much
to
give
individual
help
as
to
formulate
some
general
plan
and
to
work
upon
those
lines
and
yet
he
wished
an
intimate
view
of
the
things
he
meant
to
devote
his
life
to
bettering
so
the
clean
little
room
over
the
quiet
hardware
store
seemed
to
suit
his
wants
the
thin
jew
and
his
fat
homely
wife
who
kept
it
had
lived
in
that
neighborhood
for
many
years
and
philip
found
them
a
mine
of
useful
information
regarding
the
things
he
wished
to
know
the
building
was
narrow
and
but
three
stories
high
and
his
landlord
occupied
all
of
the
second
story
save
the
one
room
which
was
let
to
philip
he
arranged
with
levinsky
to
have
his
breakfast
with
them
he
soon
learned
to
like
the
jew
and
his
wife
while
they
were
and
sympathetic
they
seldom
permitted
their
sympathy
to
encroach
upon
their
purse
but
this
philip
knew
was
a
matter
of
environment
and
early
influence
he
drew
from
them
one
day
the
story
of
their
lives
and
it
ran
like
this
ben
levinsky
forebears
had
long
lived
in
warsaw
from
father
to
son
from
one
generation
to
another
they
had
handed
down
a
bookshop
which
included
bookbinding
in
a
small
way
they
were
and
widely
read
their
customers
were
largely
among
the
gentiles
and
for
a
long
time
the
waves
passed
over
them
leaving
them
untouched
they
were
inoffensive
peaceable
citizens
and
had
been
for
generations
one
bleak
december
day
at
a
market
place
in
warsaw
a
young
jew
baited
beyond
endurance
struck
out
madly
at
his
aggressors
and
in
the
general
mêlée
that
followed
the
son
of
a
high
official
was
killed
no
one
knew
how
he
became
involved
in
the
brawl
for
he
was
a
sober
youngster
and
very
popular
just
how
he
was
killed
and
by
whom
was
never
known
but
the
jew
had
struck
the
first
blow
and
that
was
all
sufficient
for
the
blood
of
hate
to
surge
in
the
eyes
of
the
mob
then
began
a
blind
unreasoning
massacre
it
all
happened
within
an
hour
it
was
as
if
after
nightfall
a
tornado
had
come
out
of
the
west
and
without
warning
had
torn
and
twisted
itself
through
the
city
leaving
ruin
and
death
in
its
wake
no
jew
that
could
be
found
was
spared
saul
levinsky
was
sitting
in
his
shop
looking
over
some
books
that
had
just
come
from
the
binder
he
heard
shots
in
the
distance
and
the
dull
angry
roar
of
the
mob
he
closed
his
door
and
bolted
it
and
went
up
the
little
stairs
leading
to
his
family
quarters
his
wife
and
daughter
were
there
ben
a
boy
of
ten
had
gone
to
a
nobleman
home
to
deliver
some
books
and
had
not
returned
levinsky
expected
the
mob
to
pass
his
place
and
leave
it
unmolested
it
stopped
hesitated
and
then
rammed
in
the
door
it
was
all
over
in
a
moment
father
mother
and
child
lay
dead
and
torn
almost
limb
from
limb
the
rooms
were
wrecked
and
the
mob
moved
on
the
tempest
passed
as
quickly
as
it
came
and
when
little
ben
reached
his
home
the
street
was
as
silent
as
the
grave
with
quivering
lip
and
uncertain
feet
he
picked
his
way
from
room
to
room
until
he
came
to
what
were
once
his
father
mother
and
baby
sister
and
then
he
swooned
away
when
he
awoke
he
was
shivering
with
cold
for
a
moment
he
did
not
realize
what
had
happened
then
with
a
heartbreaking
cry
he
fled
the
place
nor
did
he
stop
until
he
was
a
league
away
he
crept
under
the
sheltering
eaves
of
a
house
and
cold
and
miserable
he
sobbed
himself
to
sleep
in
the
morning
an
itinerant
tinker
came
by
and
touched
by
the
child
distress
drew
from
him
his
unhappy
story
he
was
a
lonely
old
man
and
offered
to
take
ben
with
him

offer
which
was
gladly
accepted
we

the

of

philip
begins
a
new
career
after
sifting
the
offers
made
him
philip
finally
accepted
two
one
from
a
large
new
york
daily
that
syndicated
throughout
the
country
and
one
from
a
widely
read
magazine
to
contribute
a
series
of
twelve
articles
both
the
newspaper
and
the
magazine
wished
to
dictate
the
subject
matter
about
which
he
was
to
write
but
he
insisted
upon
the
widest
latitude
the
sum
paid
and
to
be
paid
seemed
to
him
out
of
proportion
to
the
service
rendered
but
he
failed
to
take
into
account
the
value
of
the
advertising
to
those
who
had
secured
the
use
of
his
pen
he
accepted
the
offers
not
alone
because
he
must
needs
do
something
for
a
livelihood
but
largely
for
the
good
he
thought
he
might
do
the
cause
to
which
he
was
enlisted
he
determined
to
write
upon
social
subjects
only
though
he
knew
that
this
would
be
a
disappointment
to
his
publishers
he
wanted
to
write
an
article
or
two
before
he
began
his
permanent
work
for
if
he
wrote
successfully
he
thought
it
would
add
to
his
influence
so
he
began
immediately
and
finished
his
first
contribution
to
the
syndicate
newspapers
in
time
for
them
to
use
it
the
following
sunday
he
told
in
a
simple
way
the
story
of
the
turners
in
conclusion
he
said
the
rich
and
the
were
as
a
rule
charitable
enough
when
distress
came
to
their
doors
but
the
trouble
was
that
they
were
unwilling
to
seek
it
out
they
knew
that
it
existed
but
they
wanted
to
come
in
touch
with
it
as
little
as
possible
they
smothered
their
consciences
with
the
thought
that
there
were
organized
societies
and
other
mediums
through
which
all
poverty
was
reached
and
to
these
they
gave
they
knew
that
this
was
not
literally
true
but
it
served
to
make
them
think
less
badly
of
themselves
a
direct
and
forceful
manner
he
pointed
out
that
our
civilization
was
fundamentally
wrong
inasmuch
as
among
other
things
it
restricted
efficiency
that
if
society
were
properly
organized
there
would
be
none
who
were
not
sufficiently
clothed
and
fed
that
the
laws
habits
and
ethical
training
in
vogue
were
alike
responsible
for
the
inequalities
in
opportunity
and
the
consequent
wide
difference
between
the
few
and
the
many
that
the
result
of
such
conditions
was
to
render
inefficient
a
large
part
of
the
population
the
percentage
differing
in
each
country
in
the
ratio
that
education
and
enlightened
and
unselfish
laws
bore
to
ignorance
bigotry
and
selfish
but
little
progress
he
said
had
been
made
in
the
early
centuries
for
the
reason
that
opportunity
had
been
confined
to
a
few
and
it
was
only
recently
that
any
considerable
part
of
the
world
population
had
been
in
a
position
to
become
efficient
and
mark
the
result
therefore
he
argued
as
an
economical
proposition
divorced
from
the
realm
of
ethics
the
statesmen
of
if
not
of
will
labor
to
the
end
that
every
child
born
of
woman
may
have
an
opportunity
to
accomplish
that
for
which
it
is
best
fitted
their
bodies
will
be
properly
clothed
and
fed
at
the
minimum
amount
of
exertion
so
that
life
may
mean
something
more
than
a
mere
struggle
for
existence
humanity
as
a
whole
will
then
be
able
to
do
its
share
towards
the
conquest
of
the
complex
forces
of
nature
and
there
will
be
brought
about
an
intellectual
and
spiritual
quickening
that
will
make
our
civilization
of
seem
as
crude
as
selfish
and
illogical
as
that
of
the
dark
ages
seem
now
to
us
philip
article
was
widely
read
and
was
the
subject
of
much
comment
favorable
and
otherwise
there
were
the
few
who
want
to
the
world
in
a
day
that
objected
to
its
moderation
and
there
were
his
more
numerous
critics
who
hold
that
to
those
that
have
more
should
be
given
these
considered
his
doctrine
dangerous
to
the
general
welfare
meaning
their
own
welfare
but
upon
the
greater
number
it
made
a
profound
impression
and
it
awakened
many
a
sleeping
conscience
as
was
shown
by
the
hundreds
of
letters
which
he
received
from
all
parts
of
the
country
all
this
was
a
tremendous
encouragement
to
the
young
social
worker
for
the
letters
he
received
showed
him
that
he
had
a
definite
public
to
address
whom
he
might
lead
if
he
could
keep
his
medium
for
a
time
at
least
naturally
the
publishers
of
the
newspaper
and
magazine
for
which
he
wrote
understood
this
but
they
also
understood
that
it
was
usually
possible
to
control
intractable
writers
after
they
had
acquired
a
taste
for
publicity
and
their
attitude
was
for
the
time
being
one
of
general
enthusiasm
and
liberality
tempered
by
such
trivial
attempts
at
control
as
had
already
been
made
no
sooner
had
he
seen
the
first
story
in
print
than
he
began
formulating
his
ideas
for
a
second
this
he
planned
would
be
a
companion
piece
to
that
of
the
turners
which
was
typical
of
the
native
american
family
driven
to
the
east
side
by
the
inevitable
workings
of
the
social
order
and
would
take
up
the
problem
of
the
foreigner
immigrating
to
this
country
and
its
effect
upon
our
national
life
in
this
second
article
he
incorporated
the
story
of
the
levinskys
as
being
fairly
representative
of
the
problem
he
wished
to
treat
in
preparing
these
articles
philip
had
used
his
eyes
for
the
first
time
in
such
work
and
he
was
pleased
to
find
no
harm
came

it
the

still
cautioned
moderation
but
otherwise
dismissed
him

fully

was
spending
more
and
more
of
her
time
in
settlement
work
in
spite
of
the
opposition
of
her
family
naturally
their
work
brought
them
much
into

even
closer

dark
days
when
gloria
was
trying
to
aid
him
in
the
readjustment
of
his
life
they
were
to
all
appearances
simply
comrades
in
complete
understanding

saw
in

a
masterly
man
with
a
prodigious
intellect
bent
upon
accomplishing
a
revolutionary
adjustment
of

and
he
knew
that
nothing
would
deter
him
from
his
purpose
the
magnitude
of
the
task
and
the
uncertainties
of
success
made
him

might
become

many
unhappy

the

companion
in

strawn
was
a
placid
colorless
woman
content
to
go
the
conventional
way
without
definite
purpose
further
than
to
avoid
the
rougher
places
in
life
she
was
convinced
that
men
were
placed
here
for
the
sole
purpose
of
shielding
and
caring
for
women
and
she
had
a
contempt
for
any
man
who
refused
or
was
unable
to
do
so
gloria
extreme
advanced
views
of
life
alarmed
her
and
seemed
unnatural
she
protested
as
strongly
as
she
could
without
upsetting
her
equanimity
for
to
go
beyond
that
she
felt
was
unladylike
and
bad
for
both
nerves
and
digestion
it
was
a
grief
for
her
to
see
gloria
actually
working
with
anyone
much
less
philip
whose
theories
were
quite
upsetting
and
who
after
all
was
beyond
the
pale
of
their
social
sphere
and
was
impossible
as
a
consequently
philip
was
not
surprised
when
one
day
in
the
fall
he
received
a
disconsolate
note
from
gloria
who
was
spending
a
few
weeks
with
her
parents
at
their
camp
in
the
hills
beyond
tuxedo
saying
that
her
father
had
flatly
refused
to
allow
her
to
take
a
regular
position
with
one
of
the
new
york
settlements
which
would
require
her
living
on
the
east
side
instead
of
at
home
the
note
concluded
now
philip
do
come
up
for
sunday
and
let
talk
it
over
for
i
am
sadly
at
variance
with
my
family
and
i
need
your
assistance
and
advice
your
very
sincere
gloria
the
letter
left
dru
in
a
strangely
disturbed
state
of
mind
and
all
during
the
trip
up
from
new
york
his
thoughts
were
on
gloria
and
what
the
future
would
bring
forth
to
them
both
on
the
afternoon
following
his
arrival
at
the
camp
as
he
and
the
young
woman
walked
over
the
hills
aflame
with
autumnal
splendor
gloria
told
of
her
bitter
disappointment
the
young
man
listened
in
sympathy
but
after
a
long
pause
in
which
she
saw
him
weighing
the
whole
question
in
his
mind
he
said
well
gloria
so
far
as
your
work
alone
is
concerned
there
is
something
better
that
you
can
do
if
you
will
the
most
important
things
to
be
done
now
are
not
amongst
the
poor
but
amongst
the
rich
there
is
where
you
may
become
a
forceful
missionary
for
good
all
of
us
can
reach
the
poor
for
they
welcome
us
but
there
are
only
a
few
who
think
like
you
who
can
reach
the
rich
and
powerful
let
that
be
your
field
of
endeavor
do
your
work
gently
and
with
moderation
so
that
some
at
least
may
listen
if
we
would
convince
and
convert
we
must
veil
our
thoughts
and
curb
our
enthusiasm
so
that
those
we
would
influence
will
think
us
reasonable
well
philip
answered
gloria
if
you
really
think
i
can
help
the
cause
of
course
i
sure
you
can
help
the
cause
a
lack
of
understanding
is
the
chief
obstacle
but
gloria
you
know
that
this
is
not
an
easy
thing
for
me
to
say
for
i
realize
that
it
will
largely
take
you
out
of
my
life
for
my
path
leads
in
the
other
direction
it
will
mean
that
i
will
no
longer
have
you
as
a
daily
inspiration
and
the
sordidness
and
loneliness
will
press
all
the
harder
but
we
have
seen
the
true
path
and
now
have
a
clearer
understanding
of
the
meaning
and
importance
of
our
work
and
so
philip
it
is
decided
that
you
will
go
back
to
the
east
side
to
your
destiny
and
i
will
remain
here
there

everywhere

could

by

infamous
sort
of
deception
regarding

real
opinions
and
intentions
plutocracy
had
succeeded
in
electing
its
creature
to
the

there
had
been
formed
a
league
the
membership
of
which
was
composed
of
one
thousand
each
one
contributing
ten
thousand
dollars
this
gave
a
fund
of
ten
million
dollars
with
which
to
mislead
those
that
could
be
misled
and
to
debauch
the
weak
and
uncertain
this
nefarious
plan
was
conceived
by
a
senator
whose
swollen
fortune
had
been
augmented
year
after
year
through
the
tributes
paid
him
by
the
interests
he
represented
he
had
a
marvelous
aptitude
for
political
manipulation
and
organization
and
he
forged
a
subtle
chain
with
which
to
hold
in
subjection
the
natural
impulses
of
the
people
his
plan
was
simple
but
behind
it
was
the
cunning
of
a
mind
that
had
never
known
defeat
there
was
no
man
in
either
of
the
great
political
parties
that
was
big
enough
to
cope
with
him
or
to
unmask
his
methods
up
to
the
advent
of
senator
selwyn
the
interests
had
not
successfully
concealed
their
hands
sometimes
the
public
had
been
mistaken
as
to
the
true
character
of
their
officials
but
sooner
or
later
the
truth
had
developed
for
in
most
instances
wealth
was
openly
for
or
against
certain
men
and
measures
but
the
adroit
selwyn
moved
differently
his
first
move
was
to
confer
with
john
thor
the
high
priest
of
finance
and
unfold
his
plan
to
him
explaining
how
essential
was
secrecy
it
was
agreed
between
them
that
it
should
be
known
to
the
two
of
them
only
thor
influence
throughout
commercial
america
was
absolute
his
wealth
his
ability
and
even
more
the
sum
of
the
capital
he
could
control
through
the
banks
trust
companies
and
industrial
organizations
which
he
dominated
made
his
word
as
potent
as
that
of
a
monarch
he
and
selwyn
together
went
over
the
roll
and
selected
the
thousand
that
were
to
give
each
ten
thousand
dollars
some
they
omitted
for
one
reason
or
another
but
when
they
had
finished
they
had
named
those
who
could
make
or
break
within
a
day
any
man
or
corporation
within
their
sphere
of
influence
thor
was
to
send
for
each
of
the
thousand
and
compliment
him
by
telling
him
that
there
was
a
matter
appertaining
to
the
general
welfare
of
the
business
fraternity
which
needed
twenty
thousand
dollars
that
he
thor
would
put
up
ten
and
wanted
him
to
put
up
as
much
that
sometime
in
the
future
or
never
as
the
circumstances
might
require
would
he
make
a
report
as
to
the
expenditure
and
purpose
therefor
there
were
but
few
men
of
business
between
the
atlantic
and
pacific
or
between
canada
and
mexico
who
did
not
consider
themselves
fortunate
in
being
called
to
new
york
by
thor
and
in
being
asked
to
join
him
in
a
blind
pool
looking
to
the
of
wealth
consequently
the
amassing
of
this
great
corruption
fund
in
secret
was
simple
if
necessity
had
demanded
it
twice
the
sum
could
have
been
raised
the
money
when
collected
was
placed
in
thor
name
in
different
banks
controlled
by
him
and
thor
from
time
to
time
as
requested
by
selwyn
placed
in
banks
designated
by
him
whatever
sums
were
needed
selwyn
then
transferred
these
amounts
to
the
private
bank
of
his
who
became
final
paymaster
the
result
was
that
the
public
had
no
chance
of
obtaining
any
knowledge
of
the
fund
or
how
it
was
spent
the
plan
was
simple
the
result
effective
selwyn
had
no
one
to
interfere
with
him
the
members
of
the
pool
had
contributed
blindly
to
thor
and
thor
preferred
not
to
know
what
selwyn
was
doing
nor
how
he
did
it
it
was
a
one
man
power
which
in
the
hands
of
one
possessing
ability
of
the
first
class
is
always
potent
for
good
or
evil
not
only
did
selwyn
plan
to
win
the
presidency
but
he
also
planned
to
bring
under
his
control
both
the
senate
and
the
supreme
court
he
selected
one
man
in
each
of
thirty
of
the
states
some
of
them
belonging
to
his
party
and
some
to
the
opposition
whom
he
intended
to
have
run
for
the
senate
if
he
succeeded
in
getting
twenty
of
them
elected
he
counted
upon
having
a
good
majority
of
the
senate
because
there
were
already
senators
upon
whom
he
could
rely
in
any
serious
attack
upon
corporate
wealth
as
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
nine
justices
there
were
three
that
were
what
he
termed
safe
and
sane
and
another
that
could
be
counted
upon
in
a
serious
crisis
three
of
them
upon
whom
he
could
not
rely
were
of
advanced
age
and
it
was
practically
certain
that
the
next
president
would
have
that
many
vacancies
to
fill
then
there
would
be
an
easy
working
majority
his
plan
contemplated
nothing
further
than
this
his
intention
was
to
block
all
legislation
adverse
to
the
interests
he
would
have
no
new
laws
to
fear
and
of
the
old
the
supreme
court
would
properly
interpret
them
he
did
not
intend
that
his
senators
should
all
vote
alike
speak
alike
or
act
from
apparently
similar
motives
where
they
came
from
states
dominated
by
corporate
wealth
he
would
have
them
frankly
vote
in
the
open
and
according
to
their
conviction
when
they
came
from
agricultural
states
where
the
sentiment
was
known
as
progressive
they
could
cover
their
intentions
in
many
ways
one
method
was
by
urging
an
amendment
so
radical
that
no
honest
progressive
would
consent
to
it
and
then
refusing
to
support
the
more
moderate
measure
because
it
did
not
go
far
enough
another
was
to
inject
some
clause
that
was
clearly
unconstitutional
and
insist
upon
its
adoption
and
refusing
to
vote
for
the
bill
without
its
insertion
selwyn
had
no
intention
of
letting
any
one
senator
know
that
he
controlled
any
other
senator
there
were
to
be
no
caucuses
no
conferences
of
his
making
or
anything
that
looked
like
an
organization
he
was
the
center
and
from
him
radiated
everything
appertaining
to
measures
affecting
the
interests
chapter
xii
selwyn
seeks
a
candidate
selwyn
then
began
carefully
scrutinizing
such
public
men
in
the
states
known
as
presidential
cradles
as
seemed
to
him
eligible
by
a
process
of
elimination
he
centered
upon
two
that
appeared
desirable
one
was
james
rockland
recently
elected
governor
of
a
state
of
the
middle
west
the
man
had
many
of
the
earmarks
of
a
demagogue
which
selwyn
readily
recognized
and
he
therefore
concluded
to
try
him
first
accordingly
he
went
to
the
capital
of
the
state
ostensibly
upon
private
business
and
dropped
in
upon
the
governor
in
the
most
casual
way
rockland
was
distinctly
flattered
by
the
attention
for
selwyn
was
perhaps
the
best
known
figure
in
american
politics
while
he
himself
had
only
begun
to
attract
attention
they
had
met
at
conventions
and
elsewhere
but
they
were
practically
unacquainted
for
rockland
had
never
been
permitted
to
enter
the
charmed
circle
which
gathered
around
selwyn
good
morning
governor
said
selwyn
when
he
had
been
admitted
to
rockland
private
room
i
was
passing
through
the
capital
and
i
thought
i
would
look
in
on
you
and
see
how
your
official
cares
were
using
you
i
am
glad
to
see
you
senator
said
rockland
effusively
very
glad
for
there
are
some
party
questions
coming
up
at
the
next
session
of
the
legislature
about
which
i
particularly
desire
your
advice
i
have
but
a
moment
now
rockland
answered
the
senator
but
if
you
will
dine
with
me
in
my
rooms
at
the
mandell
house
it
will
be
a
pleasure
to
talk
over
such
matters
with
you
thank
you
senator
at
what
hour
you
had
better
come
at
seven
for
if
i
finish
my
business
here
i
shall
leave
on
the
for
washington
said
selwyn
thus
in
the
most
casual
way
the
meeting
was
arranged
as
a
matter
of
fact
rockland
had
no
party
matters
to
discuss
and
selwyn
knew
it
he
also
knew
that
rockland
was
ambitious
to
become
a
leader
and
to
get
within
the
little
group
that
controlled
the
party
and
the
nation
rockland
was
a
man
of
much
ability
but
he
fell
far
short
of
measuring
up
with
selwyn
who
was
in
a
class
by
himself
the
governor
was
a
good
orator
at
times
even
brilliant
and
while
not
a
forceful
man
yet
he
had
magnetism
which
served
him
still
better
in
furthering
his
political
fortunes
he
was
not
one
that
could
be
grossly
corrupted
yet
he
was
willing
to
play
to
the
galleries
in
order
to
serve
his
ambition
and
he
was
willing
to
forecast
his
political
acts
in
order
to
obtain
potential
support
when
he
reached
the
mandell
house
he
was
at
once
shown
to
the
rooms
selwyn
received
him
cordially
enough
to
be
polite
and
asked
him
if
he
would
not
look
over
the
afternoon
paper
for
a
moment
while
he
finished
a
note
he
was
writing
he
wrote
leisurely
then
rang
for
a
boy
and
ordered
dinner
to
be
served
selwyn
merely
tasted
the
wine
he
seldom
did
more
but
rockland
drank
freely
though
not
to
excess
after
they
had
talked
over
the
local
matters
which
were
supposed
to
be
the
purpose
of
the
conference
much
to
rockland
delight
the
senator
began
to
discuss
national
politics
rockland
began
selwyn
can
you
hold
this
state
in
line
at
next
year
election
i
feel
sure
that
i
can
senator
why
do
you
ask
since
we
have
been
talking
here
he
replied
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
if
you
could
be
nominated
and
elected
again
the
party
might
do
worse
than
to
consider
you
for
the
presidential
nomination
the
year
following
no
my
dear
fellow
do
interrupt
me
continued
selwyn
mellifluously
it
is
strange
how
fate
or
chance
enters
into
the
life
of
man
and
even
of
nations
a
business
matter
calls
me
here
i
pass
your
office
and
think
to
pay
my
respects
to
the
governor
of
the
state
some
political
questions
are
perplexing
you
and
my
presence
suggests
that
i
may
aid
in
their
solution
this
dinner
follows
your
personality
appeals
to
me
and
the
thought
flits
through
my
mind
why
should
not
rockland
rather
than
some
other
man
lead
the
party
two
years
from
now
and
the
result
my
dear
rockland
may
be
probably
will
be
your
becoming
chief
magistrate
of
the
greatest
republic
the
sun
has
ever
shone
on
rockland
by
this
time
was
fairly
hypnotized
by
selwyn
words
and
by
their
tremendous
import
for
a
moment
he
dared
not
trust
himself
to
speak
senator
selwyn
he
said
at
last
it
would
be
idle
for
me
to
deny
that
you
have
excited
within
me
an
ambition
that
a
moment
ago
would
have
seemed
worse
than
folly
your
influence
within
the
party
and
your
ability
to
conduct
a
campaign
gives
to
your
suggestion
almost
the
tender
of
the
presidency
to
tell
you
that
i
am
deeply
moved
does
scant
justice
to
my
feelings
if
after
further
consideration
you
think
me
worthy
of
the
honor
i
shall
feel
under
lasting
obligations
to
you
which
i
shall
endeavor
to
repay
in
every
way
consistent
with
honor
and
with
a
sacred
regard
for
my
oath
of
office
i
want
to
tell
you
frankly
rockland
answered
selwyn
that
up
to
now
i
have
had
someone
else
in
mind
but
i
am
in
no
sense
committed
and
we
might
as
well
discuss
the
matter
to
as
near
a
conclusion
as
is
possible
at
this
time
selwyn
voice
hardened
a
little
as
he
went
on
you
would
not
want
a
nomination
that
could
not
carry
with
a
reasonable
certainty
of
election
therefore
i
would
like
to
go
over
with
you
your
record
both
public
and
private
in
the
most
open
yet
confidential
way
it
is
better
that
you
and
i
in
the
privacy
of
these
rooms
should
lay
bare
your
past
than
that
it
should
be
done
in
a
bitter
campaign
and
by
your
enemies
what
we
say
to
one
another
here
is
to
be
as
if
never
spoken
and
the
grave
itself
must
not
be
more
silent
your
private
life
not
only
needs
to
be
clean
but
there
must
be
no
public
act
at
which
any
one
can
point
an
accusing
finger
of
course
of
course
said
rockland
with
a
gesture
meant
to
convey
the
complete
openness
of
his
record
then
comes
the
question
of
party
regularity
continued
selwyn
without
noticing
be
candid
with
me
for
if
you
are
not
the
recoil
will
be
upon
your
own
head
i
am
sure
that
i
can
satisfy
you
on
every
point
senator
i
have
never
scratched
a
party
ticket
nor
have
i
ever
voted
against
any
measure
endorsed
by
a
party
caucus
said
governor
rockland
that
is
well
smiled
the
senator
i
assume
that
in
making
your
important
appointments
you
will
consult
those
of
us
who
have
stood
sponsor
for
you
not
only
to
the
party
but
to
the
country
it
would
be
very
humiliating
to
me
if
i
should
insist
upon
your
nomination
and
election
and
then
should
for
four
years
have
to
apologize
for
what
i
had
done
musingly
as
if
contemplating
the
divine
presence
in
the
works
of
man
selwyn
went
on
while
he
closely
watched
rockland
from
behind
his
eyelids
our
scheme
of
government
contemplates
i
think
a
diffuse
responsibility
my
dear
rockland
while
a
president
has
a
constitutional
right
to
act
alone
he
has
no
moral
right
to
act
contrary
to
the
tenets
and
traditions
of
his
party
or
to
the
advice
of
the
party
leaders
for
the
country
accepts
the
candidate
the
party
and
the
party
advisers
as
a
whole
and
not
severally
it
is
a
natural
check
which
by
custom
the
country
has
endorsed
as
wise
and
which
must
be
followed
in
order
to
obtain
a
proper
organization
do
you
follow
me
governor
and
do
you
endorse
this
unwritten
law
if
rockland
had
heard
this
at
second
hand
if
he
had
read
it
or
if
it
had
related
to
someone
other
than
himself
he
would
have
detected
the
sophistry
of
it
but
exhilarated
by
wine
and
intoxicated
by
ambition
he
saw
nothing
but
a
pledge
to
deal
squarely
by
the
organization
senator
he
replied
fulsomely
gratitude
is
one
of
the
tenets
of
my
religion
and
therefore
inversely
ingratitude
is
unknown
to
me
you
and
the
organization
can
count
on
my
loyalty
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
for
i
shall
never
fail
you
i
know
you
will
not
ask
me
to
do
anything
at
which
my
conscience
will
rebel
nor
to
make
an
appointment
that
is
not
entirely
fit
that
rockland
goes
without
saying
answered
the
senator
with
dignity
i
have
all
the
wealth
and
all
the
position
that
i
desire
i
want
nothing
now
except
to
do
my
share
towards
making
my
native
land
grow
in
prosperity
and
to
make
the
individual
citizen
more
contented
to
do
this
we
must
cease
this
eternal
agitation
this
constant
proposal
of
measures
which
the
demagogues
are
offering
as
a
panacea
to
all
the
ills
that
flesh
is
heir
to
we
need
peace
legislative
and
political
peace
so
that
our
people
may
turn
to
their
industries
and
work
them
to
success
in
the
wholesome
knowledge
that
the
laws
governing
commerce
and
trade
conditions
will
not
be
disturbed
over
night
i
agree
with
you
there
senator
said
rockland
eagerly
we
have
more
new
laws
now
than
we
can
digest
in
a
decade
continued
selwyn
so
let
us
have
rest
until
we
do
digest
them
in
europe
the
business
world
works
under
stable
conditions
there
we
find
no
proposal
to
change
the
money
system
between
moons
there
we
find
no
uncertainty
from
month
to
month
regarding
the
laws
under
which
manufacturers
are
to
make
their
products
but
with
us
it
is
a
wise
man
who
knows
when
he
can
afford
to
enlarge
his
output
a
high
tariff
threatens
a
low
one
and
a
large
part
of
the
time
the
business
world
lies
in
helpless
perplexity
i
take
it
rockland
that
you
are
in
favor
of
stability
that
you
will
join
me
in
my
endeavors
to
give
the
country
a
chance
to
develop
itself
and
its
marvelous
natural
resources
as
a
matter
of
fact
rockland
career
had
given
no
evidence
of
such
views
he
had
practically
committed
his
political
fortunes
on
the
side
of
the
progressives
but
the
world
had
turned
around
since
then
and
he
viewed
things
differently
senator
he
said
his
voice
tense
in
his
anxiety
to
prove
his
reliability
i
find
that
in
the
past
i
have
taken
only
a
cursory
view
of
conditions
i
see
clearly
that
what
you
have
outlined
is
a
high
order
of
statesmanship
you
are
constructive
i
have
been
on
the
side
of
those
who
would
tear
down
i
will
gladly
join
hands
with
you
and
build
up
so
that
the
wealth
and
power
of
this
country
shall
come
to
equal
that
of
any
two
nations
in
existence
selwyn
settled
back
in
his
chair
nodding
his
approval
and
telling
himself
that
he
would
not
need
to
seek
further
for
his
candidate
at
rockland
earnest
solicitation
he
remained
over
another
day
the
governor
gave
him
copies
of
his
speeches
and
messages
so
that
he
could
assure
himself
that
there
was
no
serious
flaw
in
his
public
record
selwyn
cautioned
him
about
changing
his
attitude
too
suddenly
go
on
rockland
as
you
have
done
in
the
past
it
will
not
do
to
see
the
light
too
quickly
you
have
the
progressives
with
you
now
keep
them
and
i
will
let
the
conservatives
know
that
you
think
straight
and
may
be
trusted
we
must
consult
frequently
together
he
continued
but
cautiously
there
is
no
need
for
any
one
to
know
that
we
are
working
together
harmoniously
i
may
even
get
some
of
the
conservative
papers
to
attack
you
judiciously
it
will
not
harm
you
but
above
all
do
nothing
of
importance
without
consulting
me
i
am
committing
the
party
and
the
nation
to
you
and
my
responsibility
is
a
heavy
one
and
i
owe
it
to
them
that
no
mistakes
are
made
you
may
trust
me
senator
said
rockland
i
understand
perfectly
chapter
xiii
dru
and
selwyn
meet
the
roads
of
destiny
oftentimes
lead
us
in
strange
and
unlooked
for
directions
and
bring
together
those
whose
thoughts
and
purposes
are
as
wide
as
space
itself
when
gloria
strawn
first
entered
boarding
school
the
roommate
given
her
was
janet
selwyn
the
youngest
daughter
of
the
senator
they
were
alike
in
nothing
except
perhaps
in
their
fine
perception
of
truth
and
honor
but
they
became
devoted
friends
and
had
carried
their
attachment
for
one
another
beyond
their
schoolgirl
days
gloria
was
a
frequent
visitor
at
the
selwyn
household
both
in
washington
and
philadelphia
and
was
a
favorite
with
the
senator
he
often
bantered
her
concerning
her
socialistic
views
and
she
in
turn
would
declare
that
he
would
some
day
see
the
light
now
and
then
she
let
fall
a
hint
of
philip
and
one
day
senator
selwyn
suggested
that
she
invite
him
over
to
philadelphia
to
spend
the
week
end
with
them
gloria
i
would
like
to
meet
this
paragon
of
the
ages
said
he
jestingly
although
i
am
somewhat
fearful
that
he
may
persuade
me
to
all
that
i
have
and
give
it
to
the
poor
i
will
promise
to
protect
you
during
this
one
visit
senator
said
gloria
but
after
that
i
shall
leave
you
to
your
fate
dear
philip
wrote
gloria
the
great
senator
selwyn
has
expressed
a
wish
to
know
you
and
at
his
suggestion
i
am
writing
to
ask
you
here
to
spend
with
us
the
coming
week
end
i
have
promised
that
you
will
not
denude
him
of
all
his
possessions
at
your
first
meeting
but
beyond
that
i
have
refused
to
go
seriously
though
i
think
you
should
come
for
if
you
would
know
something
of
politics
then
why
not
get
your
lessons
from
the
fountain
head
your
very
sincere
gloria
in
reply
philip
wrote
dear
gloria
you
are
ever
anticipating
my
wishes
in
the
crusade
we
are
making
i
find
it
essential
to
know
politics
if
we
are
to
reach
the
final
goal
that
we
have
in
mind
and
you
have
prepared
the
way
for
the
first
lesson
i
will
be
over
on
the
four
please
do
not
bother
to
meet
me
faithfully
yours
philip
gloria
and
janet
strawn
were
at
the
station
to
meet
him
janet
this
is
dru
said
gloria
it
makes
me
very
happy
to
have
my
two
best
friends
meet
as
they
got
in
her
electric
runabout
janet
strawn
said
since
dinner
will
not
be
served
for
two
hours
or
more
let
us
drive
in
the
park
for
a
while
gloria
was
pleased
to
see
that
philip
was
interested
in
the
bright
vivacious
chatter
of
her
friend
and
she
was
glad
to
hear
him
respond
in
the
same
light
strain
however
she
was
confessedly
nervous
when
senator
selwyn
and
philip
met
though
in
different
ways
she
admired
them
both
profoundly
selwyn
had
a
delightful
personality
and
gloria
felt
sure
that
philip
would
come
measurably
under
the
influence
of
it
even
though
their
views
were
so
widely
divergent
and
in
this
she
was
right
here
she
felt
were
two
great
antagonists
and
she
was
eager
for
the
intellectual
battle
to
begin
but
she
was
to
be
disappointed
for
philip
became
the
listener
and
did
but
little
of
the
talking
he
led
senator
selwyn
into
a
dissertation
upon
the
present
conditions
of
the
country
and
the
bearing
of
the
political
questions
upon
them
selwyn
said
nothing
indiscreet
yet
he
unfolded
to
philip
view
a
new
and
potential
world
later
in
the
evening
the
senator
was
unsuccessful
in
his
efforts
to
draw
from
his
young
guest
his
point
of
view
philip
saw
the
futility
of
such
a
discussion
and
contented
selwyn
by
expressing
an
earnest
appreciation
of
his
patience
in
making
clear
so
many
things
about
which
he
had
been
ignorant
next
morning
senator
selwyn
was
strolling
with
gloria
in
the
rose
garden
when
he
said
gloria
i
like
your
friend
dru
i
do
not
recall
ever
having
met
any
one
like
him
then
you
got
him
to
talk
after
we
left
last
night
i
am
so
glad
i
was
afraid
he
had
on
one
of
his
quiet
spells
no
he
said
but
little
but
the
questions
he
asked
gave
me
glimpses
of
his
mind
that
sometimes
startled
me
he
was
polite
modest
but
elusive
nevertheless
i
like
him
and
shall
see
more
of
him
far
sighted
as
selwyn
was
he
did
not
know
the
full
extent
of
this
prophecy
chapter
xiv
the
making
of
a
president
selwyn
now
devoted
himself
to
the
making
of
enough
conservative
senators
to
control
comfortably
that
body
the
task
was
not
difficult
to
a
man
of
his
sagacity
with
all
the
money
he
could
spend
newspapers
were
subsidized
in
ways
they
scarcely
recognized
themselves
honest
officials
who
were
in
the
way
were
removed
by
offering
them
places
vastly
more
remunerative
and
in
this
manner
he
built
up
a
strong
intelligent
and
well
constructed
machine
it
was
done
so
sanely
and
so
quietly
that
no
one
suspected
the
master
mind
behind
it
all
selwyn
was
responsible
to
no
one
took
no
one
into
his
confidence
and
was
therefore
in
no
danger
of
betrayal
it
was
a
fascinating
game
to
selwyn
it
appealed
to
his
intellectual
side
far
more
than
it
did
to
his
avarice
he
wanted
to
govern
the
nation
with
an
absolute
hand
and
yet
not
be
known
as
the
directing
power
he
arranged
to
have
his
name
appear
less
frequently
in
the
press
and
he
never
submitted
to
interviews
laughingly
ridding
himself
of
reporters
by
asserting
that
he
knew
nothing
of
importance
he
had
a
supreme
contempt
for
the
blatant
politician
and
he
removed
himself
as
far
as
possible
from
that
type
in
the
meantime
his
senators
were
being
elected
the
rockland
sentiment
was
steadily
growing
and
his
nomination
was
finally
brought
about
by
the
progressives
fighting
vigorously
for
him
and
the
conservatives
yielding
a
reluctant
consent
it
was
done
so
adroitly
that
rockland
would
have
been
fooled
himself
had
not
selwyn
informed
him
in
advance
of
each
move
as
it
was
made
after
the
nomination
selwyn
had
trusted
men
put
in
charge
of
the
campaign
which
he
organized
himself
though
largely
under
cover
the
opposition
party
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
they
would
be
successful
and
it
was
a
great
intellectual
treat
to
selwyn
to
overcome
their
natural
advantages
by
the
sheer
force
of
ability
plus
what
money
he
needed
to
carry
out
his
plans
he
put
out
the
cry
of
lack
of
funds
and
indeed
it
seemed
to
be
true
for
he
was
too
wise
to
make
a
display
of
his
resources
to
ward
heelers
to
the
daily
press
and
to
professional
stump
speakers
he
gave
scant
comfort
it
was
not
to
such
sources
that
he
looked
for
success
he
began
by
eliminating
all
states
he
knew
the
opposition
party
would
certainly
carry
but
he
told
the
party
leaders
there
to
claim
that
a
revolution
was
brewing
and
that
a
landslide
would
follow
at
the
election
this
would
keep
his
antagonists
busy
and
make
them
less
effective
elsewhere
he
also
ignored
the
states
where
his
side
was
sure
to
win
in
this
way
he
was
free
to
give
his
entire
thoughts
to
the
twelve
states
that
were
debatable
and
upon
whose
votes
the
election
would
turn
he
divided
each
of
these
states
into
units
containing
five
thousand
voters
and
at
the
national
headquarters
he
placed
one
man
in
charge
of
each
unit
of
the
five
thousand
he
roughly
calculated
there
would
be
two
thousand
voters
that
no
kind
of
persuasion
could
turn
from
his
party
and
two
thousand
that
could
not
be
changed
from
the
opposition
this
would
leave
one
thousand
doubtful
ones
to
win
over
so
he
had
a
careful
poll
made
in
each
unit
and
eliminated
the
strictly
unpersuadable
party
men
and
got
down
to
a
complete
analysis
of
the
debatable
one
thousand
information
was
obtained
as
to
their
race
religion
occupation
and
former
political
predilection
it
was
easy
then
to
know
how
to
reach
each
individual
by
literature
by
persuasion
or
perhaps
by
some
more
subtle
argument
no
mistake
was
made
by
sending
the
wrong
letter
or
the
wrong
man
to
any
of
the
desired
one
thousand
in
the
states
so
divided
there
was
at
the
local
headquarters
one
man
for
each
unit
just
as
at
the
national
headquarters
so
these
two
had
only
each
other
to
consider
and
their
duty
was
to
bring
to
rockland
a
majority
of
the
one
thousand
votes
within
their
charge
the
local
men
gave
the
conditions
the
national
men
gave
the
proper
literature
and
advice
and
the
local
man
then
applied
it
the
money
that
it
cost
to
maintain
such
an
organization
was
more
than
saved
from
the
waste
that
would
have
occurred
under
the
old
method
the
opposition
management
was
sending
out
tons
of
printed
matter
but
they
sent
it
to
state
headquarters
that
in
turn
distributed
it
to
the
county
organizations
where
it
was
dumped
into
a
corner
and
given
to
visitors
when
asked
for
selwyn
committee
used
as
much
printed
matter
but
it
went
in
a
sealed
envelope
along
with
a
cordial
letter
direct
to
a
voter
that
had
as
yet
not
decided
how
he
would
vote
the
opposition
was
sending
speakers
at
great
expense
from
one
end
of
the
country
to
the
other
and
the
sound
of
their
voices
rarely
fell
on
any
but
friendly
and
sympathetic
ears
selwyn
sent
men
into
his
units
to
personally
persuade
each
of
the
one
thousand
hesitating
voters
to
support
the
rockland
ticket
the
opposition
was
spending
large
sums
upon
the
daily
press
selwyn
used
the
weekly
press
so
that
he
could
reach
the
fireside
of
every
farmer
and
the
dweller
in
the
small
country
towns
these
were
the
ones
that
would
read
every
line
in
their
local
papers
and
ponder
over
it
the
opposition
had
its
candidates
going
by
special
train
to
every
part
of
the
union
making
many
speeches
every
day
and
mostly
to
voters
that
could
not
be
driven
from
him
either
by
force
or
persuasion
the
leaders
in
cities
both
large
and
small
would
secure
a
date
and
having
in
mind
for
themselves
a
postmastership
or
collectorship
would
tell
their
followers
to
turn
out
in
great
force
and
give
the
candidate
a
big
ovation
they
wanted
the
candidate
to
remember
the
enthusiasm
of
these
places
and
to
leave
greatly
pleased
and
under
the
belief
that
he
was
making
untold
converts
as
a
matter
of
fact
his
voice
would
seldom
reach
any
but
a
staunch
partisan
selwyn
kept
rockland
at
home
and
arranged
to
have
him
meet
by
special
appointment
the
important
citizens
of
the
twelve
uncertain
states
he
would
have
the
most
prominent
party
leader
in
a
particular
state
go
to
a
rich
brewer
or
large
manufacturer
whose
views
had
not
yet
been
crystallized
and
say
governor
rockland
has
expressed
a
desire
to
know
you
and
i
would
like
to
arrange
a
meeting
the
man
approached
would
be
flattered
to
think
he
was
of
such
importance
that
a
candidate
for
the
presidency
had
expressed
a
desire
to
meet
him
he
would
know
it
was
his
influence
that
was
wanted
but
even
so
there
was
a
subtle
flattery
in
that
an
appointment
would
be
arranged
just
before
he
came
into
rockland
presence
his
name
and
a
short
epitome
of
his
career
would
be
handed
to
rockland
to
read
when
he
reached
rockland
home
he
would
at
first
be
denied
admittance
his
sponsor
would
say
this
is
munting
of
muntingville
oh
pardon
me
munting
governor
rockland
expects
you
and
in
this
way
he
is
ushered
into
the
presence
of
the
great
his
fame
up
to
a
moment
ago
was
unknown
to
rockland
but
he
now
grasps
his
hand
cordially
and
says
i
am
delighted
to
know
you
munting
i
recall
the
address
you
made
a
few
years
ago
when
you
gave
a
library
to
muntingville
it
is
men
of
your
type
that
have
made
america
what
it
is
and
whether
you
support
me
or
not
if
i
am
elected
president
it
is
such
as
you
that
i
hope
will
help
sustain
my
hands
in
my
effort
to
give
to
our
people
a
clean
sane
and
conservative
government
when
munting
leaves
he
is
stepping
on
air
he
sees
visions
of
visits
to
washington
to
consult
the
president
upon
matters
of
state
and
perhaps
he
sees
an
ambassadorship
in
the
misty
future
he
becomes
ardent
supporter
and
his
purse
is
open
and
his
influence
is
used
to
the
fullest
extent
and
this
was
selwyn
way
it
was
all
so
simple
the
opposition
was
groaning
under
the
thought
of
having
one
hundred
millions
of
people
to
reach
and
of
having
to
persuade
a
majority
of
twenty
millions
of
voters
to
take
their
view
selwyn
had
only
one
thousand
doubtful
voters
in
each
of
a
few
units
on
his
mind
and
he
knew
the
very
day
when
a
majority
of
them
had
decided
to
vote
for
rockland
and
that
his
fight
was
won
the
of
the
opposition
was
filled
with
incompetent
political
hacks
that
had
been
fastened
upon
the
management
by
men
of
influence
selwyn
force
from
end
to
end
was
composed
of
able
men
who
did
a
full
day
work
under
the
eye
of
their
watchful
taskmaster
and
selwyn
won
and
rockland
became
the
keystone
of
the
arch
he
had
set
out
to
build
there
followed
in
orderly
succession
the
inauguration
the
selection
of
cabinet
officers
and
the
new
administration
was
launched
drunk
with
power
and
the
adulation
of
sycophants
once
or
twice
rockland
asserted
himself
and
acted
upon
important
matters
without
having
first
conferred
with
selwyn
but
after
he
had
been
bitterly
assailed
by
selwyn
papers
and
by
his
senators
he
made
no
further
attempts
at
independence
he
felt
that
he
was
utterly
helpless
in
that
strong
hands
and
so
indeed
he
was
one
of
the
supreme
court
justices
died
two
retired
because
of
age
and
all
were
replaced
by
men
suggested
by
selwyn
he
now
had
the
senate
the
executive
and
a
majority
of
the
court
of
last
resort
the
government
was
in
his
hands
he
had
reached
the
summit
of
his
ambition
and
the
joy
of
it
made
all
his
work
seem
worth
while
but
selwyn
great
man
that
he
was
did
not
know
could
not
know
that
when
his
power
was
greatest
it
was
most
insecure
he
did
not
know
could
not
know
what
force
was
working
to
his
ruin
and
to
the
ruin
of
his
system
take
heart
therefore
you
who
had
lost
faith
in
the
ultimate
destiny
of
the
republic
for
a
greater
than
selwyn
is
here
to
espouse
your
cause
he
comes
panoplied
in
justice
and
with
the
light
of
reason
in
his
eyes
he
comes
as
the
advocate
of
equal
opportunity
and
he
comes
with
the
power
to
enforce
his
will
chapter
xv
the
exultant
conspirators
it
was
a
strange
happening
the
way
the
disclosure
was
made
and
the
nation
came
to
know
of
the
conspiracy
to
control
the
government
thor
being
without
any
delicate
sense
of
honor
was
in
the
habit
of
using
a
dictagraph
to
record
what
was
intended
to
be
confidential
conversations
he
would
take
these
confidential
records
clearly
mark
them
and
place
them
in
his
private
safe
within
the
vault
when
the
transaction
to
which
they
related
was
closed
he
destroyed
them
the
character
of
the
instrument
was
carefully
concealed
it
was
a
part
of
a
massive
piece
of
office
furniture
which
answered
for
a
table
as
well
in
order
to
facilitate
his
correspondence
he
often
used
it
for
dictating
and
no
one
but
thor
knew
that
it
was
ever
put
into
commission
for
other
purposes
he
had
never
but
once
had
occasion
to
use
a
record
that
related
to
a
private
conversation
or
agreement
then
it
concerned
a
matter
involving
a
large
sum
a
demand
having
been
made
upon
him
that
smacked
of
blackmail
he
arranged
a
meeting
which
his
opponent
regarded
as
an
indication
that
he
was
willing
to
yield
there
were
present
the
contestant
his
lawyer
thor
counsel
and
thor
himself
before
discussing
the
business
that
is
before
us
said
thor
i
think
you
would
all
enjoy
more
or
less
a
record
which
i
have
in
my
dictagraph
and
which
i
have
just
listened
to
with
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
he
handed
a
tube
to
each
and
started
the
machine
it
is
a
pity
that
hogarth
could
not
have
been
present
to
have
painted
the
several
expressions
that
came
upon
the
faces
of
those
four
a
quiet
but
amused
satisfaction
beamed
from
thor
and
his
counsel
could
not
conceal
a
broad
smile
but
the
wretched
victim
was
fairly
sick
from
mortification
and
defeated
avarice
he
finally
could
stand
no
more
and
took
the
tube
from
his
ear
reached
for
his
hat
and
was
gone
thor
had
not
seen
selwyn
for
a
long
time
but
one
morning
when
he
was
expecting
another
for
whom
he
had
his
dictagraph
set
selwyn
was
announced
he
asked
him
in
and
gave
orders
that
they
were
not
to
be
disturbed
when
selwyn
had
assured
himself
that
they
were
absolutely
alone
he
told
thor
his
whole
story
it
was
of
absorbing
interest
and
thor
listened
fairly
hypnotized
by
the
recital
which
at
times
approached
the
dramatic
it
was
the
first
time
that
selwyn
had
been
able
to
unbosom
himself
and
he
enjoyed
the
impression
he
was
making
upon
the
great
financier
when
he
told
how
rockland
had
made
an
effort
for
freedom
and
how
he
brought
him
back
squirming
under
his
defeat
they
laughed
joyously
rich
though
he
was
beyond
the
dreams
of
avarice
rich
as
no
man
had
ever
before
been
thor
could
not
refrain
from
a
mental
calculation
of
how
enormously
such
a
situation
advanced
his
fortune
there
was
to
be
no
restriction
now
he
could
annihilate
and
absorb
at
will
he
had
grown
so
powerful
that
his
mental
equilibrium
was
unbalanced
upon
the
question
of
accretion
he
wanted
more
he
must
have
more
and
now
by
the
aid
of
selwyn
he
would
have
more
he
was
so
exultant
that
he
gave
some
expression
to
his
thoughts
and
selwyn
cynical
as
he
was
was
shocked
and
began
to
fear
the
consequences
of
his
handiwork
he
insisted
upon
selwyn
lunching
with
him
in
order
to
celebrate
the
triumph
of
their
plan
selwyn
was
amused
at
the
plural
they
went
to
a
club
and
remained
for
several
hours
talking
of
things
of
general
interest
for
selwyn
refused
to
discuss
his
victory
after
they
had
left
the
protecting
walls
of
thor
office
thor
had
forgotten
his
other
engagement
and
along
with
it
he
forgot
the
dictagraph
that
he
had
set
when
he
returned
to
his
office
he
could
not
recall
whether
or
not
he
had
set
the
dictagraph
he
looked
at
it
saw
that
it
was
not
set
but
that
there
was
an
unused
record
in
it
and
dismissed
it
from
his
mind
he
wanted
no
more
business
for
the
day
he
desired
to
get
out
and
walk
and
think
and
enjoy
the
situation
and
so
he
went
a
certain
unholy
joy
within
his
warped
and
heart
chapter
xvi
the
exposure
long
after
thor
had
gone
long
after
the
day
had
dwindled
into
twilight
and
the
twilight
had
shaded
into
dusk
thomas
spears
his
secretary
sat
and
pondered
after
thor
and
selwyn
had
left
the
office
for
luncheon
he
had
gone
to
the
dictagraph
to
see
whether
there
was
anything
for
him
to
take
he
found
the
record
saw
it
had
been
used
removed
it
to
his
machine
and
got
ready
to
transmit
he
was
surprised
to
find
that
it
was
selwyn
voice
that
came
to
him
then
thor
and
again
selwyn
he
knew
then
that
it
was
not
intended
for
dictation
that
there
was
some
mistake
and
yet
he
held
it
until
he
had
gotten
the
whole
of
the
mighty
conspiracy
pale
and
greatly
agitated
he
remained
motionless
for
a
long
time
then
he
returned
to
thor
office
placed
a
new
record
in
the
machine
and
closed
it
spears
came
from
sturdy
new
england
stock
and
was
at
heart
a
patriot
he
had
come
to
new
york
largely
by
accident
of
circumstances
spears
had
a
friend
named
harry
tracy
with
whom
he
had
grown
up
in
the
little
connecticut
village
they
called
home
and
who
was
distantly
related
to
thor
whose
forebears
also
came
from
that
vicinity
they
had
gone
to
the
same
commercial
school
and
were
trained
particularly
in
stenography
and
typing
tracy
sought
and
obtained
a
place
in
office
he
was
attentive
to
his
duties
very
accurate
and
because
of
his
kinship
and
trustworthiness
thor
made
him
his
confidential
secretary
the
work
became
so
heavy
that
tracy
got
permission
to
employ
an
assistant
he
had
spears
in
mind
for
the
place
and
after
conferring
with
thor
offered
it
to
him
thor
consented
largely
because
he
preferred
some
one
who
had
not
lived
in
new
york
and
was
in
no
way
entangled
with
the
life
and
sentiment
of
the
city
being
from
new
england
himself
he
trusted
the
people
of
that
section
as
he
did
no
others
so
thomas
spears
was
offered
the
place
and
gladly
accepted
it
he
had
not
been
there
long
before
he
found
himself
doing
all
the
stenographic
work
and
typing
spears
was
a
man
of
few
words
he
did
his
work
promptly
and
well
thor
had
him
closely
shadowed
for
a
long
while
and
the
report
came
that
he
had
no
bad
habits
and
but
few
companions
and
those
of
the
best
but
thor
could
get
no
confidential
report
upon
the
workings
of
his
mind
he
did
not
know
that
his
conscience
sickened
at
what
he
learned
through
the
correspondence
and
from
his
fellow
clerks
he
did
not
know
that
his
every
heart
beat
was
for
the
unfortunates
that
came
within
the
reach
of
thor
avarice
and
were
left
the
merest
derelicts
upon
the
financial
seas
all
the
clerks
were
gone
the
lights
were
out
and
spears
sat
by
the
window
looking
out
over
the
great
modern
babylon
still
fighting
with
his
conscience
his
sense
of
loyalty
to
the
man
who
gave
him
his
livelihood
rebelled
at
the
thought
of
treachery
it
was
not
unlike
accepting
food
and
shelter
and
murdering
your
benefactor
for
spears
well
knew
that
in
the
present
state
of
the
public
mind
if
once
the
truth
were
known
it
would
mean
death
to
such
as
thor
for
with
a
fatuous
ignorance
of
public
feeling
the
interests
had
gone
blindly
on
conceding
nothing
stifling
competition
and
absorbing
the
wealth
and
energies
of
the
people
spears
knew
that
the
whole
social
and
industrial
fabric
of
the
nation
was
at
high
tension
and
that
it
needed
but
a
spark
to
explode
he
held
within
his
hand
that
spark
should
he
plunge
the
country
his
country
into
a
bloody
internecine
war
or
should
he
let
the
selwyns
and
the
thors
trample
the
hopes
the
fortunes
and
the
lives
of
the
people
under
foot
for
still
another
season
if
he
held
his
peace
it
did
but
postpone
the
conflict
the
thought
flashed
through
his
mind
of
the
bigness
of
the
sum
any
one
of
the
several
great
dailies
would
give
to
have
the
story
and
then
there
followed
a
sense
of
shame
that
he
could
think
of
such
a
thing
he
felt
that
he
was
god
instrument
for
good
and
that
he
should
act
accordingly
he
was
aroused
now
he
would
no
longer
parley
with
his
conscience
what
was
best
to
do
that
was
the
only
question
left
to
debate
he
looked
at
an
illuminated
clock
upon
a
large
white
shaft
that
lifted
its
marble
shoulders
towards
the
stars
it
was
nine
he
turned
on
the
lights
ran
over
the
telephone
book
until
he
reached
the
name
of
what
he
considered
the
most
important
daily
he
said
john
office
desires
to
speak
with
the
managing
editor
this
at
once
gave
him
the
connection
he
desired
this
is
john
thor
secretary
and
i
would
like
to
see
you
immediately
upon
a
matter
of
enormous
public
importance
may
i
come
to
your
office
at
once
there
was
something
in
the
voice
that
startled
the
newspaper
man
and
he
wondered
what
thor
office
could
possibly
want
with
him
concerning
any
matter
public
or
private
however
he
readily
consented
to
an
interview
and
waited
with
some
impatience
for
the
quarter
of
an
hour
to
go
by
that
was
necessary
to
cover
the
distance
he
gave
orders
to
have
spears
brought
in
as
soon
as
he
arrived
when
spears
came
he
told
the
story
with
hesitation
and
embarrassment
the
managing
editor
thought
at
first
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
a
lunatic
but
after
a
few
questions
he
began
to
believe
he
had
a
dictagraph
in
his
office
and
asked
for
the
record
he
was
visibly
agitated
when
the
full
import
of
the
news
became
known
to
him
spears
insisted
that
the
story
be
given
to
all
the
city
papers
and
to
the
associated
press
which
the
managing
editor
promised
to
do
when
the
story
was
read
the
next
morning
by
america
millions
it
was
clear
to
every
person
that
a
crisis
had
come
and
that
revolution
was
imminent
men
at
once
divided
themselves
into
groups
now
as
it
has
ever
been
the
very
poor
largely
went
with
the
rich
and
powerful
the
reason
for
this
may
be
partly
from
fear
and
partly
from
habit
they
had
seen
the
struggle
going
on
for
centuries
and
with
but
one
result
a
mass
meeting
was
called
to
take
place
the
day
following
at
new
largest
public
hall
the
call
was
not
inflammatory
but
asked
all
good
citizens
to
lend
their
counsel
and
influence
to
the
rectification
of
those
abuses
that
had
crept
into
the
government
and
it
was
signed
by
many
of
the
best
known
men
in
the
nation
the
hall
was
packed
to
its
limits
an
hour
before
the
time
named
a
distinguished
college
president
from
a
nearby
town
was
given
the
chair
and
in
a
few
words
he
voiced
the
indignation
and
the
humiliation
which
they
all
felt
then
one
speaker
after
another
bitterly
denounced
the
administration
and
advocated
the
overthrow
of
the
government
one
more
intemperate
than
the
rest
urged
an
immediate
attack
on
thor
and
all
his
kind
this
was
met
by
a
roar
of
approval
philip
had
come
early
and
was
seated
well
in
front
in
the
pandemonium
that
now
prevailed
no
speaker
could
be
heard
finally
philip
fought
his
way
to
the
stage
gave
his
name
to
the
chairman
and
asked
to
be
heard
when
the
college
president
arose
there
was
a
measure
of
quiet
and
when
he
mentioned
philip
name
and
they
saw
his
splendid
homely
face
there
was
a
curious
hush
he
waited
for
nearly
a
minute
after
perfect
quiet
prevailed
and
then
in
a
voice
like
a
bell
he
spoke
with
such
fervor
and
eloquence
that
one
who
was
present
said
afterwards
that
he
knew
the
hour
and
the
man
had
come
philip
explained
that
hasty
and
action
had
ruined
other
causes
as
just
as
theirs
and
advised
moderation
he
suggested
that
a
committee
be
named
by
the
chairman
to
draw
up
a
plan
of
procedure
to
be
presented
at
another
meeting
to
be
held
the
following
night
this
was
agreed
to
and
the
chairman
received
tremendous
applause
when
he
named
philip
first
this
meeting
had
been
called
so
quickly
and
the
names
attached
to
the
call
were
so
favorably
known
that
the
country
at
large
seemed
ready
to
wait
upon
its
conclusions
it
was
apparent
from
the
size
and
earnestness
of
the
second
gathering
that
the
interest
was
growing
rather
than
abating
philip
read
the
plan
which
his
committee
had
formulated
and
then
explained
more
at
length
their
reasons
for
offering
it
briefly
it
advised
no
resort
to
violence
but
urged
immediate
organization
and
cooperation
with
citizens
throughout
the
united
states
who
were
in
sympathy
with
the
movement
he
told
them
that
the
conscience
of
the
people
was
now
aroused
and
that
there
would
be
no
halting
until
the
government
was
again
within
their
hands
to
be
administered
for
the
good
of
the
many
instead
of
for
the
good
of
a
rapacious
few
the
resolutions
were
sustained
and
once
more
philip
was
placed
at
the
head
of
a
committee
to
perfect
not
only
a
state
but
a
national
organization
as
well
calls
for
funds
to
cover
preliminary
expenses
brought
immediate
and
generous
response
and
the
contest
was
on
chapter
xvii
selwyn
and
thor
defend
themselves
in
the
meantime
selwyn
and
thor
had
issued
an
address
defending
their
course
as
warranted
by
both
the
facts
and
the
law
they
said
that
the
government
had
been
honeycombed
by
irresponsible
demagogues
that
were
fattening
upon
the
credulity
of
the
people
to
the
great
injury
of
our
commerce
and
prosperity
that
no
laws
unfriendly
to
the
best
interests
had
been
planned
and
no
act
had
been
contemplated
inconsistent
with
the
dignity
and
honor
of
the
nation
they
contended
that
in
protecting
capital
against
vicious
assaults
they
were
serving
the
cause
of
labor
and
advancing
the
welfare
of
all
thor
whereabouts
was
a
mystery
but
selwyn
brave
and
defiant
pursued
his
usual
way
president
rockland
also
made
a
statement
defending
his
appointments
of
justices
of
the
supreme
court
and
challenged
anyone
to
prove
them
unfit
he
said
that
from
the
foundation
of
the
government
it
had
become
customary
for
a
president
to
make
such
appointments
from
amongst
those
whose
views
were
in
harmony
with
his
own
that
in
this
case
he
had
selected
men
of
well
known
integrity
and
of
profound
legal
ability
and
because
they
were
such
they
were
brave
enough
to
stand
for
the
right
without
regard
to
the
clamor
of
and
ignorant
people
he
stated
that
he
would
continue
to
do
his
duty
and
that
he
would
uphold
the
constitutional
rights
of
all
the
people
without
distinction
to
race
color
or
previous
condition
acting
under
selwyn
advice
rockland
began
to
concentrate
quietly
troops
in
the
large
centers
of
population
he
also
ordered
the
fleets
into
home
waters
a
careful
inquiry
was
made
regarding
the
views
of
the
several
governors
within
easy
reach
of
washington
and
finding
most
of
them
favorable
to
the
government
he
told
them
that
in
case
of
disorder
he
would
honor
their
requisition
for
federal
troops
he
advised
a
thorough
overlooking
of
the
militia
and
the
weeding
out
of
those
likely
to
sympathize
with
the
mob
if
trouble
came
he
promised
to
act
promptly
and
forcefully
and
not
to
let
mawkish
sentiment
encourage
further
violence
he
recalled
to
them
that
the
french
revolution
was
caused
and
continued
by
the
weakness
and
inertia
of
louis
fifteenth
and
his
ministers
and
that
the
moment
the
directorate
placed
bonaparte
in
command
of
a
handful
of
troops
and
gave
him
power
to
act
by
the
use
of
grape
and
ball
he
brought
order
in
a
day
it
only
needed
a
quick
and
decisive
use
of
force
he
thought
and
untold
suffering
and
bloodshed
would
be
averted
president
rockland
believed
what
he
said
he
seemed
not
to
know
that
bonaparte
dealt
with
a
ragged
ignorant
mob
and
had
back
of
him
a
nation
that
had
been
in
a
drunken
and
bloody
orgy
for
a
period
of
years
and
wanted
to
sober
up
he
seemed
not
to
know
that
in
this
contest
the
sturdy
american
patriot
was
enlisted
against
him
and
what
he
represented
and
had
determined
to
come
once
more
into
his
own
chapter
xviii
gloria
work
bears
fruit
in
her
efforts
towards
proselyting
the
rich
gloria
had
not
neglected
her
immediate
family
by
arguments
and
by
bringing
to
the
fore
concrete
examples
to
illustrate
them
she
had
succeeded
in
awakening
within
her
father
a
curious
and
unhappy
frame
of
mind
that
shifting
and
illusive
thing
we
call
conscience
was
beginning
to
assert
itself
in
divers
ways
the
first
glimpse
that
gloria
had
of
his
change
of
heart
was
at
a
dinner
party
the
discussion
began
by
a
dyspeptic
old
banker
declaring
that
before
the
business
world
could
bring
the
laboring
classes
to
their
senses
it
would
be
necessary
to
shut
down
the
factories
for
a
time
and
discontinue
new
enterprises
in
order
that
their
dinner
buckets
and
stomachs
might
become
empty
before
gloria
could
take
up
the
cudgels
in
behalf
of
those
seeking
a
larger
share
of
the
profits
of
their
labor
strawn
had
done
so
the
debate
between
the
two
did
not
last
long
and
was
not
unduly
heated
but
gloria
knew
that
the
rubicon
had
been
crossed
and
that
in
the
future
she
would
have
a
powerful
ally
in
her
father
neither
had
she
been
without
success
in
other
directions
and
she
was
therefore
able
to
report
to
philip
very
satisfactory
progress
in
one
of
their
many
conferences
she
was
glad
to
be
able
to
tell
him
that
in
the
future
abundant
financial
backing
was
assured
for
any
cause
recommended
by
either
of
them
as
being
worthy
this
was
a
long
step
forward
and
philip
congratulated
gloria
upon
her
efficient
work
do
you
remember
gloria
he
said
how
unhappy
you
were
over
the
thought
of
laboring
among
the
rich
instead
of
the
poor
and
yet
contemplate
the
result
you
have
not
only
given
some
part
of
your
social
world
an
insight
into
real
happiness
but
you
are
enabling
the
balance
of
us
to
move
forward
at
a
pace
that
would
have
been
impossible
without
your
aid
gloria
flushed
with
pleasure
at
his
generous
praise
and
replied
it
is
good
of
you
philip
to
give
me
so
large
a
credit
and
i
will
not
deny
that
i
am
very
happy
over
the
outcome
of
my
endeavors
unimportant
though
they
be
i
am
so
glad
philip
that
you
have
been
given
the
leadership
of
our
side
in
the
coming
struggle
for
i
shall
now
feel
confident
of
success
do
not
be
too
sure
gloria
we
have
the
right
and
a
majority
of
the
american
people
with
us
yet
on
the
other
hand
we
have
opposed
to
us
not
only
resourceful
men
but
the
machinery
of
a
great
government
buttressed
by
unlimited
wealth
and
credit
why
could
not
i
out
the
sincerity
of
my
rich
converts
and
get
them
to
help
finance
your
campaign
happy
thought
if
you
succeed
in
doing
that
gloria
you
will
become
the
joan
of
our
cause
and
unborn
generations
will
hold
you
in
grateful
remembrance
how
you
do
enthuse
one
philip
i
feel
already
as
if
my
name
were
written
high
upon
the
walls
of
my
country
valhalla
tell
me
how
great
a
fund
you
will
require
and
i
will
proceed
at
once
to
build
the
golden
ladder
upon
which
i
am
to
climb
to
fame
you
need
not
make
light
of
your
suggestion
in
this
matter
gloria
for
the
lack
of
funds
with
which
to
organize
is
essentially
our
weakest
point
with
money
we
can
overthrow
the
opposition
without
it
i
am
afraid
they
may
defeat
us
as
to
the
amount
needed
i
can
set
no
limit
the
more
you
get
the
more
perfectly
can
we
organize
do
what
you
can
and
do
it
quickly
and
be
assured
that
if
the
sum
is
considerable
and
if
our
cause
triumphs
you
will
have
been
the
most
potent
factor
of
us
all
and
then
they
parted
gloria
full
of
enthusiasm
over
her
task
and
philip
with
a
silent
prayer
for
her
success
chapter
xix
war
clouds
hover
gloria
was
splendidly
successful
in
her
undertaking
and
within
two
weeks
she
was
ready
to
place
at
philip
disposal
an
amount
far
in
excess
of
anything
he
had
anticipated
it
was
so
easy
that
i
have
a
feeling
akin
to
disappointment
that
i
did
not
have
to
work
harder
she
wrote
in
her
note
to
philip
announcing
the
result
when
i
explained
the
purpose
and
the
importance
of
the
outcome
almost
everyone
approached
seemed
eager
to
have
a
share
in
the
undertaking
in
his
reply
of
thanks
philip
said
the
sum
you
have
realized
is
far
beyond
any
figure
i
had
in
mind
with
what
we
have
collected
throughout
the
country
it
is
entirely
sufficient
i
think
to
effect
a
preliminary
organization
both
political
and
military
if
the
final
result
is
to
be
civil
war
then
the
states
that
cast
their
fortunes
with
ours
will
of
necessity
undertake
the
further
financing
of
the
struggle
philip
worked
assiduously
upon
his
organization
it
was
first
intended
to
make
it
political
and
educational
but
when
the
defiant
tone
of
selwyn
thor
and
rockland
was
struck
and
their
evident
intention
of
using
force
became
apparent
he
almost
wholly
changed
it
into
a
military
organization
his
central
bureau
was
now
in
touch
with
every
state
and
he
found
in
the
west
a
grim
determination
to
bring
matters
to
a
conclusion
as
speedily
as
possible
on
the
other
hand
he
was
sparring
for
time
he
knew
his
various
groups
were
in
no
condition
to
be
pitted
against
any
considerable
number
of
trained
regulars
he
hoped
too
that
actual
conflict
would
be
avoided
and
that
a
solution
could
be
arrived
at
when
the
forthcoming
election
for
representatives
occurred
it
was
evident
that
a
large
majority
of
the
people
were
with
them
the
problem
was
to
get
a
fair
and
legal
expression
of
opinion
as
yet
there
was
no
indication
that
this
would
not
be
granted
the
preparations
on
both
sides
became
so
open
that
there
was
no
longer
any
effort
to
work
under
cover
philip
cautioned
his
adherents
against
committing
any
overt
act
he
was
sure
that
the
administration
forces
would
seize
the
slightest
pretext
to
precipitate
action
and
that
at
this
time
would
give
them
an
enormous
advantage
he
himself
trained
the
men
in
his
immediate
locality
and
he
also
had
the
organization
throughout
the
country
trained
but
without
guns
the
use
of
guns
would
not
have
been
permitted
except
to
regular
authorized
militia
the
drilling
was
done
with
wooden
guns
each
man
hewing
out
a
stick
to
the
size
and
shape
of
a
modern
rifle
at
his
home
carefully
concealed
each
man
had
his
rifle
and
then
came
the
election
troops
were
at
the
polls
and
a
free
ballot
was
denied
it
was
the
last
straw
citizens
gathering
after
nightfall
in
order
to
protest
were
told
to
disperse
immediately
and
upon
refusal
were
fired
upon
the
next
morning
showed
a
death
roll
in
the
large
centers
of
population
that
was
appalling
wisconsin
was
the
state
in
which
there
was
the
largest
percentage
of
the
citizenship
unfavorable
to
the
administration
and
to
the
interests
iowa
minnesota
and
nebraska
were
closely
following
philip
concluded
to
make
his
stand
in
the
west
and
he
therefore
ordered
the
men
in
every
organization
east
of
the
mississippi
to
foregather
at
once
at
madison
and
to
report
to
him
there
he
was
in
constant
touch
with
those
governors
who
were
in
sympathy
with
the
progressive
or
insurgent
cause
and
he
wired
the
governor
of
wisconsin
in
cipher
informing
him
of
his
intentions
as
yet
travel
had
not
been
seriously
interrupted
though
business
was
largely
at
a
standstill
and
there
was
an
ominous
quiet
over
the
land
the
opposition
misinterpreted
this
and
thought
that
the
people
had
been
frightened
by
the
unexpected
show
of
force
philip
knew
differently
and
he
also
knew
that
civil
war
had
begun
he
communicated
his
plans
to
no
one
but
he
had
the
campaign
well
laid
out
it
was
his
intention
to
concentrate
in
wisconsin
as
large
a
force
as
could
be
gotten
from
his
followers
east
and
south
of
that
state
and
to
concentrate
again
near
des
moines
every
man
west
of
illinois
whom
he
could
enlist
it
was
his
purpose
then
to
advance
simultaneously
both
bodies
of
troops
upon
chicago
in
the
south
there
had
developed
a
singular
inertia
neither
side
counted
upon
material
help
or
opposition
there
the
great
conflict
covering
the
years
from
to
was
still
more
than
a
memory
though
but
few
living
had
taken
part
in
it
the
victors
in
that
mighty
struggle
thought
they
had
been
magnanimous
to
the
defeated
but
the
southerner
knew
that
they
had
been
made
to
pay
the
most
stupendous
penalty
ever
exacted
in
modern
times
at
one
stroke
of
the
pen
two
thousand
millions
of
their
property
was
taken
from
them
a
pension
system
was
then
inaugurated
that
taxed
the
resources
of
the
nation
to
pay
by
the
year
more
than
five
thousand
millions
had
gone
to
those
who
were
of
the
winning
side
of
this
the
south
was
taxed
her
part
receiving
nothing
in
return
cynical
europe
said
that
the
north
would
have
it
appear
that
a
war
had
been
fought
for
human
freedom
whereas
it
seemed
that
it
was
fought
for
money
it
forgot
the
many
brave
and
patriotic
men
who
enlisted
because
they
held
the
union
to
be
one
and
indissoluble
and
were
willing
to
sacrifice
their
lives
to
make
it
so
and
around
whom
a
willing
and
grateful
government
threw
its
protecting
arms
and
it
confused
those
deserving
citizens
with
the
unworthy
many
whom
pension
agents
and
office
seekers
had
debauched
at
the
expense
of
the
nation
then
too
the
south
remembered
that
one
of
the
immediate
results
of
emancipation
was
that
millions
of
ignorant
and
indigent
people
were
thrown
upon
the
charity
and
protection
of
the
southern
people
to
care
for
and
to
educate
in
some
states
sixty
per
cent
of
the
population
were
negroes
and
they
were
as
helpless
as
children
and
proved
a
heavy
burden
upon
the
forty
per
cent
of
whites
in
rural
populations
more
schoolhouses
had
to
be
maintained
and
more
teachers
employed
for
the
number
taught
and
the
percentage
of
children
per
capita
was
larger
than
in
cities
then
of
necessity
separate
schools
had
to
be
maintained
so
altogether
the
load
was
a
heavy
one
for
an
impoverished
people
to
carry
the
humane
the
wise
the
patriotic
thing
to
have
done
was
for
the
nation
to
have
assumed
the
responsibility
of
the
education
of
the
negroes
for
at
least
one
generation
what
a
contrast
we
see
in
england
treatment
of
the
boers
after
a
long
and
bloody
war
which
drew
heavily
upon
the
lives
and
treasures
of
the
nation
england
first
act
was
to
make
an
enormous
grant
to
the
conquered
boers
that
they
might
have
every
facility
to
regain
their
shattered
fortunes
and
bring
order
and
prosperity
to
their
distracted
land
we
see
the
contrast
again
in
that
for
nearly
a
half
century
after
the
civil
war
was
over
no
southerner
was
considered
eligible
for
the
presidency
on
the
other
hand
within
a
few
years
after
the
african
revolution
ended
a
boer
general
who
had
fought
throughout
the
war
with
vigor
and
distinction
was
proposed
and
elected
premier
of
the
united
colonies
consequently
while
sympathizing
with
the
effort
to
overthrow
government
the
south
moved
slowly
and
with
circumspection
chapter
xx
civil
war
begins
general
dru
brought
together
an
army
of
fifty
thousand
men
at
madison
and
about
forty
thousand
near
des
moines
and
recruits
were
coming
in
rapidly
president
rockland
had
concentrated
twenty
thousand
regulars
and
thirty
thousand
militia
at
chicago
and
had
given
command
to
major
general
newton
he
who
several
years
previously
won
the
first
medal
given
by
the
war
department
for
the
best
solution
of
the
military
problem
the
president
also
made
a
call
for
two
hundred
thousand
volunteers
the
response
was
in
no
way
satisfactory
so
he
issued
a
formal
demand
upon
each
state
to
furnish
its
quota
the
states
that
were
in
sympathy
with
his
administration
responded
the
others
ignored
the
call
general
dru
learned
that
large
reinforcements
had
been
ordered
to
chicago
and
he
therefore
at
once
moved
upon
that
place
he
had
a
fair
equipment
of
artillery
considering
he
was
wholly
dependent
upon
that
belonging
to
the
militia
of
those
states
that
had
ranged
themselves
upon
his
side
and
at
several
points
in
the
west
he
had
seized
factories
and
plants
making
powder
guns
clothing
and
camp
equipment
he
ordered
the
iowa
division
to
advance
at
the
same
time
and
the
two
forces
were
joined
at
a
point
about
fifty
miles
south
of
chicago
general
newton
was
daily
expecting
reënforcements
but
they
failed
to
reach
him
before
dru
made
it
impossible
for
them
to
pass
through
newton
at
first
thought
to
attack
the
iowa
division
and
defeat
it
and
then
meet
the
wisconsin
division
but
he
hesitated
to
leave
chicago
lest
dru
should
take
the
place
during
his
absence
with
both
divisions
united
and
with
recruits
constantly
arriving
dru
had
an
army
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
failing
to
obtain
the
reënforcements
and
seeing
the
hopelessness
of
opposing
so
large
a
force
newton
began
secretly
to
evacuate
chicago
by
way
of
the
lakes
dru
having
completely
cut
him
off
by
land
he
succeeded
in
removing
his
army
to
buffalo
where
president
rockland
had
concentrated
more
than
one
hundred
thousand
troops
when
dru
found
general
newton
had
evacuated
chicago
he
occupied
it
and
then
moved
further
east
in
order
to
hold
the
states
of
michigan
indiana
and
western
ohio
this
gave
him
the
control
of
the
west
and
he
endeavored
as
nearly
as
possible
to
cut
off
the
food
supply
of
the
east
in
order
to
tighten
further
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
supplies
he
occupied
duluth
and
all
the
lake
ports
as
far
east
as
cleveland
which
city
the
government
held
and
which
was
their
furthest
western
line
canada
was
still
open
as
a
means
of
food
supply
to
the
east
as
were
all
the
ports
of
the
atlantic
seaboard
as
far
south
as
charleston
so
the
sum
of
the
situation
was
that
the
east
so
far
west
as
the
middle
of
ohio
and
as
far
south
as
west
virginia
inclusive
of
that
state
was
in
the
hands
of
the
government
western
ohio
indiana
michigan
and
illinois
while
occupied
by
general
dru
were
divided
in
their
sympathies
wisconsin
minnesota
and
every
state
west
of
the
mississippi
were
strongly
against
the
government
the
south
as
a
whole
was
negligible
though
virginia
kentucky
tennessee
and
missouri
were
largely
divided
in
sentiment
that
part
of
the
south
lying
below
the
border
states
was
in
sympathy
with
the
insurgents
the
contest
had
come
to
be
thought
of
as
a
conflict
between
senator
selwyn
on
the
one
hand
and
what
he
represented
and
philip
dru
on
the
other
and
what
he
stood
for
these
two
were
known
to
be
the
dominating
forces
on
either
side
the
contestants
on
the
face
of
things
seemed
not
unevenly
matched
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
conscience
of
the
great
mass
of
the
people
east
and
west
was
on
dru
side
for
it
was
known
that
he
was
contending
for
those
things
which
would
permit
the
nation
to
become
again
a
land
of
freedom
in
its
truest
and
highest
sense
a
land
where
the
rule
of
law
prevailed
a
land
of
equal
opportunity
a
land
where
justice
would
be
meted
out
alike
to
the
high
and
low
with
a
steady
and
impartial
hand
chapter
xxi
upon
the
eve
of
battle
neither
side
seemed
anxious
to
bring
matters
to
a
conclusion
for
both
newton
and
dru
required
time
to
put
their
respective
armies
in
fit
condition
before
risking
a
conflict
by
the
middle
of
july
dru
had
more
than
four
hundred
thousand
men
under
his
command
but
his
greatest
difficulty
was
to
properly
officer
and
equip
them
the
bulk
of
the
regular
army
officers
had
remained
with
the
government
forces
though
there
were
some
notable
exceptions
among
those
offering
their
services
to
dru
was
jack
strawn
he
resigned
from
the
regular
army
with
many
regrets
and
misgivings
but
his
devotion
to
philip
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
do
otherwise
and
then
there
was
gloria
whom
he
loved
dearly
and
who
made
him
feel
that
there
was
a
higher
duty
than
mere
professional
regularity
none
of
dru
generals
had
been
tried
out
in
battle
and
indeed
he
himself
had
not
it
was
much
the
same
with
the
government
forces
for
there
had
been
no
war
since
that
with
spain
in
the
nineties
and
that
was
an
affair
so
small
that
it
afforded
but
little
training
for
either
officers
or
men
dru
had
it
in
mind
to
make
the
one
battle
decisive
if
that
were
possible
of
accomplishment
for
he
did
not
want
to
weaken
and
distract
the
country
by
such
a
conflict
as
that
of
to
the
government
forces
numbered
six
hundred
thousand
men
under
arms
but
one
hundred
thousand
of
these
were
widely
scattered
in
order
to
hold
certain
sections
of
the
country
in
line
on
the
first
of
september
general
dru
began
to
move
towards
the
enemy
he
wanted
to
get
nearer
washington
and
the
northern
seaboard
cities
so
that
if
successful
he
would
be
within
striking
distance
of
them
before
the
enemy
could
recover
he
had
in
mind
the
places
he
preferred
the
battle
to
occur
and
he
used
all
his
skill
in
bringing
about
the
desired
result
as
he
moved
slowly
but
steadily
towards
general
newton
he
was
careful
not
to
tax
the
strength
of
his
troops
but
he
desired
to
give
them
the
experience
in
marching
they
needed
and
also
to
harden
them
the
civilized
nations
of
the
world
had
agreed
not
to
use
in
war
aeroplanes
or
any
sort
of
air
craft
either
as
engines
of
destruction
or
for
scouting
purposes
this
decision
had
been
brought
about
by
the
international
peace
societies
and
by
the
impossibility
of
using
them
without
enormous
loss
of
life
therefore
none
were
being
used
by
either
the
government
or
insurgent
forces
general
newton
thought
that
dru
was
planning
to
attack
him
at
a
point
about
twenty
miles
west
of
buffalo
where
he
had
his
army
stretched
from
the
lake
eastward
and
where
he
had
thrown
up
entrenchments
and
otherwise
prepared
for
battle
but
dru
had
no
thought
of
attacking
then
or
there
but
moved
slowly
and
orderly
on
until
the
two
armies
were
less
than
twenty
miles
apart
due
north
and
south
from
one
another
when
he
continued
marching
eastward
and
began
to
draw
away
from
general
newton
the
latter
for
the
first
time
realized
that
he
himself
would
be
compelled
to
pursue
and
attack
for
the
reason
that
he
could
not
let
dru
march
upon
new
york
and
the
other
unprotected
seaboard
cities
he
saw
too
that
he
had
been
outgeneraled
and
that
he
should
have
thrown
his
line
across
dru
path
and
given
battle
at
a
point
of
his
own
choosing
the
situation
was
a
most
unusual
one
even
in
the
complex
history
of
warfare
because
in
case
of
defeat
the
loser
would
be
forced
to
retreat
into
the
enemies
country
it
all
the
more
surely
emphasized
the
fact
that
one
great
battle
would
determine
the
war
general
dru
knew
from
the
first
what
must
follow
his
movement
in
marching
by
general
newton
and
since
he
had
now
reached
the
ground
that
he
had
long
chosen
as
the
place
where
he
wished
the
battle
to
occur
he
halted
and
arranged
his
troops
in
formation
for
the
expected
attack
there
was
a
curious
feeling
of
exultation
and
confidence
throughout
the
insurgent
army
for
dru
had
conducted
every
move
in
the
great
game
with
masterly
skill
and
no
man
was
ever
more
the
idol
of
his
troops
or
of
the
people
whose
cause
he
was
the
champion
it
was
told
at
every
camp
fire
in
his
army
how
he
had
won
the
last
medal
that
had
been
given
by
the
war
department
and
for
which
general
newton
had
been
a
contestant
and
not
one
of
his
men
doubted
that
as
a
military
genius
newton
in
no
way
measured
up
to
dru
it
was
plain
that
newton
had
been
outmaneuvered
and
that
the
advantage
lay
with
the
insurgent
forces
the
day
before
the
expected
battle
general
dru
issued
a
stirring
address
which
was
placed
in
the
hands
of
each
soldier
and
which
concluded
as
follows
it
is
now
certain
that
there
will
be
but
one
battle
and
its
result
lies
with
you
if
you
fight
as
i
know
you
will
fight
you
surely
will
be
successful
and
you
soon
will
be
able
to
return
to
your
homes
and
to
your
families
carrying
with
you
the
assurance
that
you
have
won
what
will
be
perhaps
the
most
important
victory
that
has
ever
been
achieved
it
is
my
belief
that
human
liberty
has
never
more
surely
hung
upon
the
outcome
of
any
conflict
than
it
does
upon
this
and
i
have
faith
that
when
you
are
once
ordered
to
advance
you
will
never
turn
back
if
you
will
each
make
a
resolution
to
conquer
or
die
you
will
not
only
conquer
but
our
death
list
will
not
be
nearly
so
heavy
as
if
you
at
any
time
falter
this
address
was
received
with
enthusiasm
and
comrade
declared
to
comrade
that
there
would
be
no
turning
back
when
once
called
upon
to
advance
and
it
was
a
compact
that
in
honor
could
not
be
broken
this
then
was
the
situation
upon
the
eve
of
the
mighty
conflict
chapter
xxii
the
battle
of
elma
general
dru
had
many
spies
in
the
enemies
camp
and
some
of
these
succeeded
in
crossing
the
lines
each
night
in
order
to
give
him
what
information
they
had
been
able
to
gather
some
of
these
spies
passed
through
the
lines
as
late
as
eleven
the
night
before
the
battle
and
from
them
he
learned
that
a
general
attack
was
to
be
made
upon
him
the
next
day
at
six
in
the
morning
as
far
as
he
could
gather
and
from
his
own
knowledge
of
the
situation
it
was
general
newton
purpose
to
break
his
center
the
reason
newton
had
this
in
mind
was
that
he
thought
dru
line
was
far
flung
and
he
believed
that
if
he
could
drive
through
the
center
he
could
then
throw
each
wing
into
confusion
and
bring
about
a
crushing
defeat
as
a
matter
of
fact
dru
line
was
not
far
flung
but
he
had
a
few
troops
strung
out
for
many
miles
in
order
to
deceive
newton
because
he
wanted
him
to
try
and
break
his
center
up
to
this
time
he
had
taken
no
one
into
his
confidence
but
at
midnight
he
called
his
division
commanders
to
his
headquarters
and
told
them
his
plan
of
battle
they
were
instructed
not
to
impart
any
information
to
the
commanders
of
brigades
until
two
the
men
were
then
to
be
aroused
and
given
a
hasty
breakfast
after
which
they
were
to
be
ready
to
march
by
three
recent
arrivals
had
augmented
his
army
to
approximately
five
hundred
thousand
men
general
newton
had
as
far
as
he
could
learn
approximately
six
hundred
thousand
so
there
were
more
than
a
million
of
men
facing
one
another
dru
had
a
purpose
in
preparing
at
three
in
the
morning
first
he
wanted
to
take
no
chances
upon
general
newton
time
of
attack
his
information
as
to
six
he
thought
reliable
but
it
might
have
been
given
out
to
deceive
him
and
a
much
earlier
engagement
might
be
contemplated
his
other
reason
was
that
he
intended
to
flank
newton
on
both
wings
it
was
his
purpose
to
send
under
cover
of
night
one
hundred
and
thousand
men
to
the
right
of
newton
and
one
hundred
and
thousand
to
his
left
and
have
them
conceal
themselves
behind
wooded
hills
until
noon
and
then
to
drive
in
on
him
from
both
sides
he
was
confident
that
with
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
determined
men
protected
by
the
fortifications
he
had
been
able
to
erect
and
with
the
ground
of
his
own
choosing
which
had
a
considerable
elevation
over
the
valley
through
which
newton
would
have
to
march
he
could
hold
his
position
until
noon
he
did
not
count
upon
actual
fighting
before
eight
or
perhaps
not
before
nine
dru
did
not
attempt
to
rest
but
continued
through
the
night
to
instruct
his
staff
officers
and
to
arrange
as
far
as
he
could
for
each
contingency
before
two
he
was
satisfied
with
the
situation
and
felt
assured
of
victory
he
was
pleased
to
see
the
early
morning
hours
develop
a
fog
for
this
would
cover
the
march
of
his
left
and
right
wings
and
they
would
not
have
to
make
so
wide
a
detour
in
order
that
their
movements
might
be
concealed
it
would
also
delay
he
thought
newton
attack
his
army
was
up
and
alert
at
three
and
by
four
those
that
were
to
hold
the
center
were
in
position
though
he
had
them
lie
down
again
on
their
arms
so
that
they
might
get
every
moment
of
rest
three
saw
the
troops
that
were
to
flank
the
enemy
already
on
the
march
at
his
outposts
reported
newton
army
moving
but
it
was
nine
before
they
came
within
touch
of
his
troops
in
the
meantime
his
men
were
resting
and
he
had
food
served
them
again
as
late
as
seven
newton
attacked
the
center
viciously
at
first
but
making
no
headway
and
seeing
that
his
men
were
being
terribly
decimated
he
made
a
detour
to
the
right
and
with
cavalry
infantry
and
artillery
he
drove
troops
in
from
the
position
which
they
were
holding
dru
recognized
the
threatened
danger
and
sent
heliograph
messages
to
his
right
and
left
wings
to
begin
their
attack
though
it
was
now
only
eleven
he
then
rode
in
person
to
the
point
of
danger
and
rallied
his
men
to
a
firmer
stand
upon
which
newton
could
make
no
headway
in
that
hell
storm
of
lead
and
steel
dru
sat
upon
his
horse
unmoved
with
bared
head
and
eyes
aflame
with
face
flushed
and
exultant
he
looked
the
embodiment
of
the
terrible
god
of
war
his
presence
and
his
disregard
of
danger
incited
his
soldiers
to
deeds
of
valor
that
would
forever
be
an
inspiration
and
a
benediction
to
the
race
from
which
they
sprung
newton
seeing
that
his
efforts
were
costing
him
too
dearly
decided
to
withdraw
his
troops
and
rest
until
the
next
day
when
he
thought
to
attack
dru
from
the
rear
the
ground
was
more
advantageous
there
and
he
felt
confident
he
could
dislodge
him
when
he
gave
the
command
to
retreat
he
was
surprised
to
find
dru
massing
his
troops
outside
his
entrenchments
and
preparing
to
follow
him
he
slowly
retreated
and
dru
as
slowly
followed
newton
wanted
to
get
him
well
away
from
his
stronghold
and
in
the
open
plain
and
then
wheel
and
crush
him
dru
was
merely
keeping
within
striking
distance
so
that
when
his
two
divisions
got
in
touch
with
newton
they
would
be
able
to
attack
him
on
three
sides
just
as
newton
was
about
to
turn
dru
two
divisions
poured
down
the
slopes
of
the
hills
on
both
sides
and
began
to
charge
and
when
center
began
to
charge
it
was
only
a
matter
of
moments
before
army
was
in
a
panic
he
tried
to
rally
them
and
to
face
the
enemy
but
his
efforts
were
in
vain
his
men
threw
down
their
guns
some
surrendering
but
most
of
them
fleeing
in
the
only
way
open
that
towards
the
rear
and
the
lake
dru
soldiers
saw
that
victory
was
theirs
and
maddened
by
the
lust
of
war
they
drove
the
government
forces
back
killing
and
crushing
the
seething
and
helpless
mass
that
was
now
in
hopeless
confusion
orders
were
given
by
general
dru
to
push
on
and
follow
the
enemy
until
nightfall
or
until
the
lake
was
reached
where
they
must
surrender
or
drown
by
six
of
that
fateful
day
the
splendid
army
of
newton
was
a
thing
for
pity
for
dru
had
determined
to
exhaust
the
last
drop
of
strength
of
his
men
to
make
the
victory
complete
and
the
battle
conclusive
at
the
same
time
as
far
as
he
was
able
he
restrained
his
men
from
killing
for
he
saw
that
the
enemy
were
without
arms
and
thinking
only
of
escape
his
order
was
only
partially
obeyed
for
when
man
is
in
conflict
with
either
beast
or
fellowman
the
primitive
lust
for
blood
comes
to
the
fore
and
the
gentlest
and
most
humane
are
oftentimes
the
most
bloodthirsty
of
the
enemy
forty
thousand
were
dead
and
two
hundred
and
ten
thousand
were
wounded
with
thousand
missing
of
prisoners
dru
had
captured
three
hundred
and
thousand
general
newton
was
killed
in
the
early
afternoon
soon
after
the
rout
began
philip
casualties
were
thousand
dead
and
one
hundred
and
ten
thousand
wounded
it
was
a
holocaust
but
the
war
was
indeed
ended
chapter

elma
aftermath
after
general
dru
had
given
orders
for
the
care
of
the
wounded
and
the
disposition
of
the
prisoners
he
dismissed
his
staff
and
went
quietly
out
into
the
starlight
he
walked
among
the
dead
and
wounded
and
saw
that
everything
possible
was
being
done
to
alleviate
suffering
feeling
weary
he
sat
for
a
moment
upon
a
dismembered
gun
as
he
looked
over
the
field
of
carnage
and
saw
what
havoc
the
day
had
made
he
thought
of
the
selwyns
and
the
thors
whose
selfishness
and
greed
were
responsible
for
it
all
and
he
knew
that
they
and
their
kind
would
have
to
meet
an
awful
charge
before
the
judgment
seat
of
god
within
touch
of
him
lay
a
boy
of
not
more
than
seventeen
with
his
white
face
turned
towards
the
stars
one
arm
was
shattered
and
a
piece
of
shell
had
torn
a
great
red
wound
in
the
side
of
his
chest
dru
thought
him
dead
but
he
saw
him
move
and
open
his
eyes
he
removed
a
coat
from
a
soldier
that
lay
dead
beside
him
and
pillowed
the
boy
head
upon
it
and
gave
him
some
water
and
a
little
brandy
i
am
all
in
captain
said
he
but
i
would
like
a
message
sent
home
he
saw
that
dru
was
an
officer
but
he
had
no
idea
who
he
was
i
only
enlisted
last
week
i
live
in
pennsylvania
not
far
from
here
then
more
faintly
my
mother
tried
to
persuade
me
to
remain
at
home
but
i
wanted
to
do
my
share
so
here
i
am
as
you
find
me
tell
her
tell
her
but
the
message
never
came
for
he
was
dead
after
he
had
covered
the
ghastly
face
dru
sat
in
silent
meditation
and
thought
of
the
shame
of
it
the
pity
of
it
all
somewhere
amongst
that
human
wreckage
he
knew
gloria
was
doing
what
she
could
to
comfort
the
wounded
and
those
that
were
in
the
agony
of
death
she
had
joined
the
red
cross
corps
of
the
insurgent
army
at
the
beginning
of
hostilities
but
dru
had
had
only
occasional
glimpses
of
her
he
was
wondering
now
in
what
part
of
that
black
and
bloody
field
she
was
his
was
the
strong
hand
that
had
torn
into
fragments
these
helpless
creatures
hers
was
the
gentle
hand
that
was
softening
the
horror
the
misery
of
it
all
dru
knew
there
were
those
who
felt
that
the
result
would
never
be
worth
the
cost
and
that
he
too
would
come
in
for
a
measurable
share
of
their
censure
but
deep
and
lasting
as
his
sympathy
was
for
those
who
had
been
brought
into
this
maelstrom
of
war
yet
pessimism
found
no
lodgment
within
him
rather
was
his
great
soul
illuminated
with
the
thought
that
with
splendid
heroism
they
had
died
in
order
that
others
might
live
the
better
twice
before
had
the
great
republic
been
baptized
in
blood
and
each
time
the
result
had
changed
the
thought
and
destiny
of
man
and
so
would
it
be
now
only
to
greater
purpose
never
again
would
the
selwyns
and
the
thors
be
able
to
fetter
the
people
free
and
unrestrained
by
barriers
erected
by
the
powerful
for
selfish
purposes
there
would
now
lie
open
to
them
a
glorious
and
contented
future
he
had
it
in
his
thoughts
to
do
the
work
well
now
that
it
had
been
begun
and
to
permit
no
misplaced
sentiment
to
deter
him
he
knew
that
in
order
to
do
what
he
had
in
mind
he
would
have
to
reckon
with
the
habits
and
traditions
of
centuries
but
seeing
clearly
the
task
before
him
he
must
needs
become
an
iconoclast
and
accept
the
consequences
for
two
days
and
nights
he
had
been
without
sleep
and
under
a
physical
and
mental
strain
that
would
have
meant
disaster
to
any
save
philip
dru
but
now
he
began
to
feel
the
need
of
rest
and
sleep
so
he
walked
slowly
back
to
his
tent
after
giving
orders
that
he
was
not
to
be
disturbed
he
threw
himself
as
he
was
upon
his
camp
bed
and
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
the
news
of
his
momentous
victory
had
circled
the
globe
and
that
his
name
was
upon
the
lips
of
half
the
world
he
fell
into
a
dreamless
restful
sleep
chapter

uncrowned
heroes
when
dru
wakened
in
the
morning
after
a
long
and
refreshing
sleep
his
first
thoughts
were
of
gloria
strawn
before
leaving
his
tent
he
wrote
her
an
invitation
to
dine
with
him
that
evening
in
company
with
some
of
his
generals
and
their
wives
all
through
that
busy
day
dru
found
himself
looking
forward
to
the
coming
evening
when
gloria
came
dru
was
standing
at
the
door
of
his
tent
to
meet
her
as
he
helped
her
from
the
army
conveyance
she
said
oh
philip
how
glad
i
am
how
glad
i
am
dru
knew
that
she
had
no
reference
to
his
brilliant
victory
but
that
it
was
his
personal
welfare
that
she
had
in
mind
during
the
dinner
many
stories
of
heroism
were
told
men
who
were
least
suspected
of
great
personal
bravery
had
surprised
their
comrades
by
deeds
that
would
follow
the
coming
centuries

both
song
and
story

who
had
been
a
silent
listener

now
said

my
brother
soldier
rises
above
self
and
gives
or
offers
his
life
for
that
of
his
comrade
no
one
rejoices
more
than
i
but
my
friends
the
highest
courage
is
not
displayed
upon
the
battlefield
the
soldier
heroism
is
done
under
stress
of
great
excitement
and
his
field
of
action
is
one
that
appeals
to
the
imagination
it
usually
also
touches
our
patriotism
and
the
real
heroes
of
the
world
are
oftentimes
never
known
i
once
knew
a
man
of
culture
and
wealth
who
owned
a
plantation
in
some
hot
and
inaccessible
region
smallpox
in
its
most
virulent
form
became
prevalent
among
the
negroes
everyone
fled
the
place
save
this
man
and
those
that
were
stricken
and
alone
he
nursed
them
while
they
lived
and
buried
them
when
they
died
and
yet
during
all
the
years
i
knew
him
never
once
did
he
refer
to
it
an
old
negro
told
me
the
story
and
others
afterwards
confirmed
it
this
same
man
jumped
into
a
swollen
river
and
rescued
a
poor
old
negro
who
could
not
swim
there
was
no
one
to
applaud
him
as
he
battled
with
the
deadly
eddies
and
currents
and
brought
to
safety
one
of
the
least
of
god
creatures
to
my
mind
the
flag
of
no
nation
ever
waved
above
a
braver
nobler
heart
there
was
a
moment
silence
and
then
gloria
said
philip
the
man
you
mention
is
doubtless
the
most
splendid
product
of
our
civilization
for
he
was
perhaps
as
gentle
as
he
was
brave
but
there
is
still
another
type
of
hero
to
whom
i
would
call
attention
i
shall
tell
you
of
a
man
named
sutton
whom
i
came
to
know
in
my
settlement
work
and
who
seemed
to
those
who
knew
him
wholly
bad
he
was
cruel
selfish
and
without
any
sense
of
honor
and
even
his
personality
was
repulsive
and
yet
this
is
what
he
did
one
day
soon
after
dark
the
ten
story
tenement
building
in
which
he
lived
caught
fire
smoke
was
pouring
from
the
windows
at
which
many
frightened
faces
were
seen
but
what
was
holding
the
crowd
breathless
attention
was
the
daring
attempt
of
a
man
on
the
eighth
floor
to
save
a
child
of
some
five
or
six
years
he
had
gotten
from
his
room
to
a
small
iron
balcony
and
there
he
took
his
handkerchief
and
blindfolded
the
little
boy
he
lifted
the
child
over
the
railing
and
let
him
down
to
a
stone
ledge
some
twelve
inches
wide
and
which
seemed
to
be
five
or
six
feet
below
the
balcony
the
man
had
evidently
told
the
child
to
flatten
himself
against
the
wall
for
the
little
fellow
had
spread
out
his
arms
and
pressed
his
body
close
to
it
when
the
man
reached
him
he
edged
him
along
in
front
of
him
it
was
a
perilous
journey
and
to
what
end
no
one
could
see
that
he
was
bettering
his
condition
by
moving
further
along
the
building
though
it
was
evident
he
had
a
purpose
from
the
beginning
when
he
reached
the
corner
he
stopped
in
front
of
a
large
flagpole
that
projected
out
from
the
building
some
twenty
or
more
feet
he
shouted
to
the
firemen
in
the
street
below
but
his
voice
was
lost
in
the
noise
and
distance
he
then
scribbled
something
on
an
envelope
and
after
wrapping
his
knife
inside
dropped
it
down
he
lost
no
time
by
seeing
whether
he
was
understood
but
he
took
the
child
and
put
his
arms
and
legs
about
the
pole
in
front
of
him
and
together
they
slid
along
to
the
golden
ball
at
the
end
what
splendid
courage
what
perfect
he
then
took
the
boy
arm
above
the
hand
and
swung
him
clear
he
held
him
for
a
moment
to
see
that
all
was
ready
below
and
turned
him
loose
the
child
dropped
as
straight
as
a
plummet
into
the
canvas
net
that
was
being
held
for
him
the
excitement
had
been
so
tense
up
to
now
that
in
all
that
vast
crowd
no
one
said
a
word
or
moved
a
muscle
but
when
they
saw
the
little
fellow
unhurt
and
perched
high
on
the
shoulders
of
a
burly
fireman
such
cheers
were
given
as
were
never
before
heard
in
that
part
of
new
york
the
man
it
seemed
knew
as
well
as
those
below
that
his
weight
made
impossible
his
escape
in
a
like
manner
for
he
had
slid
back
to
the
building
and
was
sitting
upon
the
ledge
smoking
a
cigarette
at
first
it
was
the
child
in
which
the
crowd
was
interested
but
now
it
was
the
man
he
must
be
saved
but
could
he
be
the
heat
was
evidently
becoming
unbearable
and
from
time
to
time
a
smother
of
smoke
hid
him
from
view
once
when
it
cleared
away
he
was
no
longer
there
it
had
suffocated
him
and
he
had
fallen
a
mangled
heap
into
the
street
below
that
man
was
sutton
and
the
child
was
not
his
own
he
could
have
saved
himself
had
he
not
stayed
to
break
in
a
door
behind
which
the
screams
of
the
child
were
heard
there
was
a
long
silence
when
gloria
had
ended
her
story
and
then
the
conversation
ran
along
more
cheerful
lines
chapter
xxv
the
administrator
of
the
republic
general
dru
began
at
once
the
reorganization
of
his
army
the
nation
knew
that
the
war
was
over
and
it
was
in
a
quiver
of
excitement
they
recognized
the
fact
that
dru
dominated
the
situation
and
that
a
master
mind
had
at
last
arisen
in
the
republic
he
had
a
large
and
devoted
army
to
do
his
bidding
and
the
future
seemed
to
lie
wholly
in
his
hands
the
great
metropolitan
dailies
were
in
keen
rivalry
to
obtain
some
statement
from
him
but
they
could
not
get
within
speaking
distance
the
best
they
could
do
was
to
fill
their
columns
with
speculations
and
opinions
from
those
near
or
at
least
pretending
to
be
near
him
he
had
too
much
to
do
to
waste
a
moment
but
he
had
it
in
mind
to
make
some
statement
of
a
general
nature
within
a
few
days
the
wounded
were
cared
for
the
dead
disposed
of
and
all
prisoners
disarmed
and
permitted
to
go
to
their
homes
under
parole
of
his
own
men
he
relieved
those
who
had
sickness
in
their
families
or
pressing
duties
to
perform
many
of
the
prisoners
at
their
urgent
solicitation
he
enlisted
the
final
result
was
a
compact
and
fairly
well
organized
army
of
some
four
hundred
thousand
men
who
were
willing
to
serve
as
long
as
they
were
needed
during
the
days
that
dru
was
reorganizing
he
now
and
then
saw
gloria
she
often
wondered
why
philip
did
not
tell
her
something
of
his
plans
and
at
times
she
felt
hurt
at
his
reticence
she
did
not
know
that
he
would
have
trusted
her
with
his
life
without
hesitation
but
that
his
sense
of
duty
sealed
his
lips
when
it
came
to
matters
of
public
policy
he
knew
she
would
not
willingly
betray
him
but
he
never
took
chances
upon
the
judgment
she
or
any
friend
might
exercise
as
to
what
was
or
what
was
not
important
when
a
thought
or
plan
had
once
gone
from
him
to
another
it
was
at
the
mercy
of
the
other
discretion
and
good
intention
did
not
avail
if
discretion
and
judgment
were
lacking
he
consulted
freely
with
those
from
whom
he
thought
he
could
obtain
help
but
about
important
matters
no
one
ever
knew
but
himself
his
conclusions
dru
was
now
ready
to
march
upon
washington
and
he
issued
an
address
to
his
soldiers
which
was
intended
in
fact
for
the
general
public
he
did
not
want
at
this
time
to
assume
unusual
powers
and
if
he
had
spoken
to
the
nation
he
might
be
criticised
as
assuming
a
dictatorial
attitude
he
complimented
his
army
upon
their
patriotism
and
upon
their
bravery
and
told
them
that
they
had
won
what
was
perhaps
the
most
important
victory
in
the
history
of
warfare
he
deplored
the
fact
that
of
necessity
it
was
a
victory
over
their
fellow
countrymen
but
he
promised
that
the
breach
would
soon
be
healed
for
it
was
his
purpose
to
treat
them
as
brothers
he
announced
that
no
one
neither
the
highest
nor
the
lowest
would
be
arrested
tried
or
in
any
way
disturbed
provided
they
accepted
the
result
of
the
battle
as
final
and
as
determining
a
change
in
the
policy
of
government
in
accordance
with
the
views
held
by
those
whom
he
represented
failure
to
acquiesce
in
this
or
any
attempt
to
foster
the
policies
of
the
government
would
be
considered
seditious
and
would
be
punished
by
death
he
was
determined
upon
immediate
peace
and
quietude
and
any
individual
newspaper
or
corporation
violating
this
order
would
be
summarily
dealt
with
the
words
late
government
caused
a
sensation
it
pointed
very
surely
to
the
fact
that
as
soon
as
dru
reached
washington
he
would
assume
charge
of
affairs
but
in
what
way
that
was
the
momentous
question
president
rockwell
the
and
the
cabinet
fearful
of
the
result
of
dru
complete
domination
fled
the
country
selwyn
urged
threatened
and
did
all
he
could
to
have
them
stand
their
ground
and
take
the
consequences
of
defeat
but
to
no
avail
finally
he
had
the
secretary
of
state
resign
so
that
the
president
might
appoint
him
to
that
office
this
being
done
he
became
acting
president
there
were
some
fifty
thousand
troops
at
washington
and
vicinity
and
dru
wired
selwyn
asking
whether
any
defense
of
that
city
was
contemplated
upon
receiving
a
negative
answer
he
sent
one
of
his
staff
officers
directly
to
washington
to
demand
a
formal
surrender
selwyn
acquiesced
in
this
and
while
the
troops
were
not
disbanded
they
were
placed
under
the
command
of
dru
emissary
after
further
negotiations
it
was
arranged
for
such
of
the
volunteers
as
desired
to
do
so
to
return
to
their
homes
this
left
a
force
of
thirty
thousand
men
at
washington
who
accepted
the
new
conditions
and
declared
fealty
to
dru
and
the
cause
he
represented
there
was
now
requisitioned
all
the
cars
that
were
necessary
to
convey
the
army
from
buffalo
to
new
york
philadelphia
and
washington
a
day
was
named
when
all
other
traffic
was
to
be
stopped
until
the
troops
equipment
and
supplies
had
been
conveyed
to
their
destinations
one
hundred
thousand
men
were
sent
to
new
york
and
one
hundred
thousand
to
philadelphia
and
held
on
the
outskirts
of
those
cities
two
hundred
thousand
were
sent
to
washington
and
there
dru
went
himself
selwyn
made
a
formal
surrender
to
him
and
was
placed
under
arrest
but
it
was
hardly
more
than
a
formality
for
selwyn
was
placed
under
no
further
restraint
than
that
he
should
not
leave
washington
his
arrest
was
made
for
its
effect
upon
the
nation
in
order
to
make
it
clear
that
the
former
government
no
longer
existed
general
dru
now
called
a
conference
of
his
officers
and
announced
his
purpose
of
assuming
the
powers
of
a
dictator
distasteful
as
it
was
to
him
and
as
he
felt
it
might
also
be
to
the
people
he
explained
that
such
a
radical
step
was
necessary
in
order
to
quickly
purge
the
government
of
those
abuses
that
had
arisen
and
give
to
it
the
form
and
purpose
for
which
they
had
fought
they
were
assured
that
he
was
free
from
any
personal
ambition
and
he
pledged
his
honor
to
retire
after
the
contemplated
reforms
had
been
made
so
that
the
country
could
again
have
a
constitutional
government
not
one
of
them
doubted
his
word
and
they
pledged
themselves
and
the
men
under
them
to
sustain
him
loyally
he
then
issued
an
address
to
his
army
proclaiming
himself
administrator
of
the
republic
chapter
xxvi
dru
outlines
his
intentions
the
day
after
this
address
was
issued
general
dru
reviewed
his
army
and
received
such
an
ovation
that
it
stilled
criticism
for
it
was
plain
that
the
new
order
of
things
had
to
be
accepted
and
there
was
a
thrill
of
fear
among
those
who
would
have
liked
to
raise
their
voices
in
protest
it
was
felt
that
the
property
and
lives
of
all
were
now
in
the
keeping
of
one
man
dru
first
official
act
was
to
call
a
conference
of
those
throughout
the
union
who
had
been
leaders
in
the
movement
to
overthrow
the
government
the
gathering
was
large
and
representative
but
he
found
no
such
unanimity
as
amongst
the
army
a
large
part
perhaps
a
majority
were
outspoken
for
an
immediate
return
to
representative
government
they
were
willing
that
unusual
powers
should
be
assumed
long
enough
to
declare
the
old
government
illegal
and
to
issue
an
immediate
call
for
a
general
election
state
and
national
to
be
held
as
usual
in
november
the
advocates
of
this
plan
were
willing
that
dru
should
remain
in
authority
until
the
duly
constituted
officials
could
be
legally
installed
dru
presided
over
the
meeting
therefore
he
took
no
part
in
the
early
discussion
further
than
to
ask
for
the
fullest
expression
of
opinion
after
hearing
the
plan
for
a
limited
dictatorship
proposed
he
arose
and
in
a
voice
vibrant
with
emotion
addressed
the
meeting
as
follows
my
fellow
countrymen
i
feel
sure
that
however
much
we
may
differ
as
to
methods
there
is
no
one
within
the
sound
of
my
voice
that
does
not
wish
me
well
and
none
i
believe
mistrusts
either
my
honesty
of
purpose
my
patriotism
or
my
ultimate
desire
to
restore
as
soon
as
possible
to
our
distracted
land
a
constitutional
government
we
all
agreed
that
a
change
had
to
be
brought
about
even
though
it
meant
revolution
for
otherwise
the
cruel
hand
of
avarice
would
have
crushed
out
from
us
and
from
our
children
every
semblance
of
freedom
if
our
late
masters
had
been
more
moderate
in
their
greed
we
would
have
been
content
to
struggle
for
yet
another
period
hoping
that
in
time
we
might
again
have
justice
and
equality
before
the
law
but
even
so
we
would
have
had
a
defective
government
defective
in
machinery
and
defective
in
its
constitution
and
laws
to
have
righted
it
a
century
of
public
education
would
have
been
necessary
the
present
opportunity
has
been
bought
at
fearful
cost
if
we
use
it
lightly
those
who
fell
upon
the
field
of
elma
will
have
died
in
vain
and
the
anguish
of
mothers
and
the
tears
of
widows
and
orphans
will
mock
us
because
we
failed
in
our
duty
to
their
beloved
dead
for
a
long
time
i
have
known
that
this
hour
would
come
and
that
there
would
be
those
of
you
who
would
stand
affrighted
at
the
momentous
change
from
constitutional
government
to
despotism
no
matter
how
pure
and
exalted
you
might
believe
my
intentions
to
be
but
in
the
long
watches
of
the
night
in
the
solitude
of
my
tent
i
conceived
a
plan
of
government
which
by
the
grace
of
god
i
hope
to
be
able
to
give
to
the
american
people
my
life
is
consecrated
to
our
cause
and
hateful
as
is
the
thought
of
assuming
supreme
power
i
can
see
no
other
way
clearly
and
i
would
be
recreant
to
my
trust
if
i
faltered
in
my
duty
therefore
with
the
aid
i
know
each
one
of
you
will
give
me
there
shall
in
god
good
time
be
wrought
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
and
for
the
people
when
dru
had
finished
there
was
generous
applause
at
first
here
and
there
a
dissenting
voice
was
heard
but
the
chorus
of
approval
drowned
it
it
was
a
splendid
tribute
to
his
popularity
and
integrity
when
quiet
was
restored
he
named
twelve
men
whom
he
wanted
to
take
charge
of
the
departments
and
to
act
as
his
advisors
they
were
all
able
men
each
distinguished
in
his
own
field
of
endeavor
and
when
their
names
were
announced
there
was
an
outburst
of
satisfaction
the
meeting
adjourned
and
each
member
went
home
a
believer
in
dru
and
the
policy
he
had
adopted
they
in
turn
converted
the
people
to
their
view
of
the
situation
so
that
dru
was
able
to
go
forward
with
his
great
work
conscious
of
the
support
and
approval
of
an
overwhelming
majority
of
his
fellow
countrymen
chapter
xxvii
a
new
era
at
washington
when
general
dru
assumed
the
responsibilities
of
government
he
saw
that
unless
he
arranged
it
otherwise
social
duties
would
prove
a
tax
upon
his
time
and
would
deter
him
from
working
with
that
celerity
for
which
he
had
already
become
famous
he
had
placed
strawn
at
the
head
of
the
treasury
department
and
he
offered
him
the
use
of
the
white
house
as
a
place
of
residence
his
purpose
was
to
have
strawn
and
gloria
relieve
him
of
those
social
functions
that
are
imposed
upon
the
heads
of
all
governments
strawn
was
delighted
with
such
an
arrangement
and
it
almost
compensated
her
for
having
been
forced
by
her
husband
and
gloria
into
the
ranks
of
the
popular
or
insurgent
party
dru
continued
to
use
the
barracks
as
his
home
though
he
occupied
the
offices
in
the
white
house
for
public
business
it
soon
became
a
familiar
sight
in
washington
to
see
him
ride
swiftly
through
the
streets
on
his
gelding
twilight
as
he
went
to
and
from
the
barracks
and
the
white
house
dru
gave
and
attended
dinners
to
foreign
ambassadors
and
special
envoys
but
at
the
usual
entertainments
given
to
the
public
or
to
the
official
family
he
was
seldom
seen
he
and
gloria
were
in
accord
regarding
the
character
of
entertainments
to
be
given
and
all
unnecessary
display
was
to
be
avoided
this
struck
a
cruel
blow
at
strawn
who
desired
to
have
everything
in
as
sumptuous
a
way
as
under
the
old
régime
but
both
dru
and
gloria
were
as
adamant
and
she
had
to
be
content
with
the
new
order
of
things
gloria
said
dru
it
pleases
me
beyond
measure
to
find
ourselves
so
nearly
in
accord
concerning
the
essential
things
and
i
am
glad
to
believe
that
you
express
your
convictions
candidly
and
are
not
merely
trying
to
please
me
that
philip
is
because
we
are
largely
striving
for
the
same
purposes
we
both
want
i
think
to
take
the
selfish
equation
out
of
our
social
fabric
we
want
to
take
away
the
sting
from
poverty
and
we
want
envy
to
have
no
place
in
the
world
of
our
making
is
it
not
so
that
seems
to
me
gloria
to
be
the
crux
of
our
endeavors
but
when
we
speak
of
unselfishness
as
we
now
have
it
in
mind
we
are
entering
a
hitherto
unknown
realm
the
definition
of
selfishness
yesterday
or
is
quite
another
thing
from
the
unselfishness
that
we
have
in
view
and
which
we
hope
and
expect
will
soon
leaven
society
i
think
perhaps
we
may
reach
the
result
quicker
if
we
call
it
mankind
new
and
higher
pleasure
or
happiness
for
that
is
what
it
will
mean
philip
it
all
seems
too
altruistic
ever
to
come
in
our
lifetime
but
do
you
know
i
am
awfully
optimistic
about
it
i
really
believe
it
will
come
so
quickly
after
it
once
gets
a
good
start
that
it
will
astound
us
the
proverbial
snowball
coming
down
the
mountain
side
will
be
as
nothing
to
it
everyone
will
want
to
join
the
procession
at
once
no
one
will
want
to
be
left
out
for
the
finger
of
scorn
to
accuse
and
strangely
enough
i
believe
it
will
be
the
educated
and
rich
in
fact
the
ones
that
are
now
the
most
selfish
that
will
be
in
the
vanguard
of
the
procession
they
will
be
the
first
to
realize
the
joy
of
it
all
and
in
this
way
will
they
redeem
the
sins
of
their
ancestors
your
enthusiasm
gloria
readily
imparts
itself
to
me
and
my
heart
quickens
with
hope
that
what
you
say
may
be
prophetic
but
to
return
to
the
immediate
work
in
hand
let
us
simplify
our
habits
and
customs
to
as
great
a
degree
as
is
possible
under
existing
circumstances
one
of
the
causes
for
the
mad
rush
for
money
is
the
desire
to
excel
our
friends
and
neighbors
in
our
manner
of
living
our
entertainments
and
the
like
everyone
has
been
trying
to
keep
up
with
the
most
extravagant
of
his
set
the
result
must
in
the
end
be
unhappiness
for
all
and
disaster
for
many
what
a
pitiful
ambition
it
is
how
how
it
narrows
the
horizon
we
can
not
help
the
poor
we
can
not
aid
our
neighbor
for
if
we
do
we
can
not
keep
our
places
in
the
unholy
struggle
for
social
equality
within
our
little
sphere
let
us
go
gloria
into
the
fresh
air
for
it
stifles
me
to
think
of
this
phase
of
our
civilization
i
wish
i
had
let
our
discussion
remain
upon
the
high
peak
where
you
placed
it
and
from
which
we
gazed
into
the
promised
land
chapter
xxviii
an
international
crisis
the
administrator
did
nothing
towards
reducing
the
army
which
including
those
in
the
philippines
and
elsewhere
totalled
five
hundred
thousand
he
thought
this
hardly
sufficient
considering
international
conditions
and
one
of
his
first
acts
was
to
increase
the
number
of
men
to
six
hundred
thousand
and
to
arm
and
equip
them
thoroughly
for
a
long
period
of
years
england
had
maintained
relations
with
the
united
states
that
amounted
to
an
active
alliance
but
there
was
evidence
that
she
had
under
discussion
with
her
enemy
germany
a
treaty
by
which
that
nation
was
to
be
allowed
a
free
hand
in
south
america
in
return
for
this
england
was
to
be
conceded
all
german
territory
in
africa
and
was
to
be
allowed
to
absorb
eventually
that
entire
continent
excepting
that
part
belonging
to
france
japan
it
seemed
was
to
be
taken
into
the
agreement
and
was
to
be
given
her
will
in
the
east
if
she
desired
the
philippines
she
might
take
them
as
far
as
european
interference
went
her
navy
was
more
powerful
than
any
the
united
states
could
readily
muster
in
the
far
pacific
and
england
would
if
necessary
serve
notice
upon
us
that
her
gunboats
were
at
japan
disposal
in
case
of
war
in
return
japan
was
to
help
in
maintaining
british
supremacy
in
india
which
was
now
threatened
by
the
vigorous
young
republic
of
china
the
latter
nation
did
not
wish
to
absorb
india
herself
but
she
was
committed
to
the
policy
of
asia
for
the
asiatics
and
it
did
not
take
much
discernment
to
see
that
some
day
soon
this
would
come
about
china
and
japan
had
already
reached
an
agreement
concerning
certain
matters
of
interest
between
them
the
most
important
being
that
japan
should
maintain
a
navy
twice
as
powerful
as
that
of
china
and
that
the
latter
should
have
an
army
more
powerful
than
that
of
japan
the
latter
was
to
confine
her
sphere
of
influence
to
the
islands
of
the
sea
and
to
korea
and
in
the
event
of
a
combined
attack
on
russia
which
was
contemplated
they
were
to
acquire
siberia
as
far
west
as
practicable
and
divide
that
territory
china
had
already
by
purchase
concessions
and
covert
threats
regained
that
part
of
her
territory
once
held
by
england
germany
and
france
she
had
a
powerful
array
and
a
navy
of
some
consequence
therefore
she
must
needs
to
be
reckoned
with
england
hold
upon
canada
was
merely
nominal
therefore
further
than
as
a
matter
of
pride
it
was
of
slight
importance
to
her
whether
she
lost
it
or
not
up
to
the
time
of
the
revolution
canada
had
been
a
hostage
and
england
felt
that
she
could
at
no
time
afford
a
rupture
with
us
but
the
alluring
vision
that
germany
held
out
to
her
was
dazzling
her
statesmen
africa
all
red
from
the
cape
to
the
mediterranean
and
from
madagascar
to
the
atlantic
was
most
alluring
and
it
seemed
so
easy
of
accomplishment
germany
maintained
her
military
superiority
as
england
even
then
held
a
navy
equal
to
any
two
powers
germany
was
to
exploit
south
america
without
reference
to
the
monroe
doctrine
and
england
was
to
give
her
moral
support
and
the
support
of
her
navy
if
necessary
if
the
united
states
objected
to
the
extent
of
declaring
war
they
were
prepared
to
meet
that
issue
together
they
could
put
into
commission
a
navy
three
times
as
strong
as
that
of
the
united
states
and
with
canada
as
a
base
and
with
a
merchant
marine
fifty
times
as
large
as
that
of
the
united
states
they
could
convey
half
a
million
men
to
north
america
as
quickly
as
dru
could
send
a
like
number
to
san
francisco
if
japan
joined
the
movement
she
could
occupy
the
pacific
slope
as
long
as
england
and
germany
were
her
allies
the
situation
which
had
sprung
up
while
the
united
states
was
putting
her
own
house
in
order
was
full
of
peril
and
general
dru
gave
it
his
careful
and
immediate
attention
none
of
the
powers
at
interest
knew
that
dru
government
had
the
slightest
intimation
of
what
was
being
discussed
the
information
had
leaked
through
one
of
the
leading
international
banking
houses
that
had
been
approached
concerning
a
possible
loan
for
a
very
large
amount
and
the
secret
had
reached
selwyn
through
thor
selwyn
not
only
gave
general
dru
this
information
but
much
else
that
was
of
extreme
value
dru
soon
came
to
know
that
at
heart
selwyn
was
not
without
patriotism
and
that
it
was
only
from
environment
and
an
overweening
desire
for
power
that
had
led
him
into
the
paths
he
had
heretofore
followed
selwyn
would
have
preferred
ruling
through
the
people
rather
than
through
the
interests
and
the
machinations
of
corrupt
politics
but
he
had
little
confidence
that
the
people
would
take
enough
interest
in
public
affairs
to
make
this
possible
and
to
deviate
from
the
path
he
had
chosen
meant
he
thought
disaster
to
his
ambitions
dru
career
proved
him
wrong
and
no
one
was
quicker
to
see
it
than
selwyn
dru
remarkable
insight
into
character
fathomed
the
real
man
and
in
a
cautious
and
limited
way
he
counseled
with
him
as
the
need
arose
chapter
xxix
the
reform
of
the
judiciary
of
his
council
of
twelve
the
administrator
placed
one
member
in
charge
of
each
of
the
nine
departments
and
gave
to
the
other
three
special
work
that
was
constantly
arising
one
of
his
advisers
was
a
man
of
distinguished
lineage
but
who
in
his
early
youth
had
been
compelled
to
struggle
against
those
unhappy
conditions
that
followed
reconstruction
in
the
south
his
intellect
and
force
of
character
had
brought
him
success
in
his
early
manhood
and
he
was
the
masterful
head
of
a
university
that
under
his
guidance
was
soon
to
become
one
of
the
foremost
in
the
world
he
was
a
trained
political
economist
and
had
rare
discernment
in
public
affairs
therefore
dru
leaned
heavily
upon
him
when
he
began
to
rehabilitate
the
government
dru
used
selwyn
unusual
talents
for
organization
and
administration
in
thoroughly
overhauling
the
actual
machinery
of
both
federal
and
state
governments
there
was
no
doubt
but
that
there
was
an
enormous
waste
going
on
and
this
he
undertook
to
stop
for
he
felt
sure
that
as
much
efficiency
could
be
obtained
at
the
cost
one
of
his
first
acts
as
administrator
was
to
call
together
five
great
lawyers
who
had
no
objectionable
corporate
or
private
practice
and
give
to
them
the
task
of
defining
the
powers
of
all
courts
both
state
and
federal
they
were
not
only
to
remodel
court
procedure
but
to
eliminate
such
courts
as
were
unnecessary
to
this
board
he
gave
the
further
task
of
reconstructing
the
rules
governing
lawyers
their
practice
before
the
courts
their
relations
to
their
clients
and
the
amount
and
character
of
their
fees
under
given
conditions
under
dru
instruction
the
commission
was
to
limit
the
power
of
the
courts
to
the
extent
that
they
could
no
longer
pass
upon
the
constitutionality
of
laws
their
function
being
merely
to
decide
as
between
litigants
what
the
law
was
as
was
the
practice
of
all
other
civilized
nations
judges
both
federal
and
state
were
to
be
appointed
for
life
subject
to
compulsory
retirement
at
seventy
and
to
forced
retirement
at
any
time
by
a
vote
of
the
house
and
a
majority
vote
of
the
senate
their
appointment
was
to
be
suggested
by
the
president
or
governor
as
the
case
might
be
and
a
majority
vote
of
the
house
and
a
vote
of
the
senate
were
necessary
for
confirmation
high
salaries
were
to
be
paid
but
the
number
of
judges
was
to
be
largely
decreased
perhaps
by
this
would
be
possible
because
the
simplification
of
procedure
and
the
curtailment
of
their
powers
would
enormously
lessen
the
amount
of
work
to
be
done
dru
called
the
board
attention
to
the
fact
that
england
had
about
two
hundred
judges
of
all
kinds
while
there
were
some
hundred
in
the
united
states
and
that
the
reversals
by
the
english
courts
were
only
about
three
per
cent
of
the
reversals
by
the
american
courts
the
united
states
had
therefore
the
most
complicated
expensive
and
inadequate
legal
machinery
of
any
civilized
nation
lawyers
were
no
longer
to
be
permitted
to
bring
suits
of
doubtful
character
and
without
facts
and
merit
to
sustain
them
hereafter
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
attorney
and
the
client
himself
to
swear
to
the
truth
of
the
allegations
submitted
in
their
petitions
of
suits
and
briefs
if
they
could
not
show
that
they
had
good
reason
to
believe
that
their
cause
was
just
they
would
be
subject
to
fines
and
imprisonment
besides
being
subject
to
damages
by
the
defendant
dru
desired
the
board
on
legal
procedure
and
judiciary
to
work
out
a
fair
and
comprehensive
system
based
along
the
fundamental
lines
he
had
laid
down
so
that
the
people
might
be
no
longer
ridden
by
either
the
law
or
the
lawyer
it
was
his
intention
that
no
man
was
to
be
suggested
for
a
judgeship
or
confirmed
who
was
known
to
drink
to
excess
either
regularly
or
periodically
or
one
who
was
known
not
to
pay
his
personal
debts
or
had
acted
in
a
reprehensible
manner
either
in
private
or
in
his
public
capacity
as
a
lawyer
any
of
these
habits
or
actions
occurring
after
appointment
was
to
subject
him
to
impeachment
moreover
any
judge
who
used
his
position
to
favor
any
individual
or
corporation
or
who
deviated
from
the
path
of
even
and
exact
justice
for
all
or
who
heckled
a
litigant
witness
or
attorney
or
who
treated
them
in
an
unnecessarily
harsh
or
insulting
manner
was
to
be
upon
complaint
duly
attested
to
by
reliable
witnesses
tried
for
impeachment
the
administrator
was
positive
in
his
determination
to
have
the
judiciary
a
most
efficient
bureau
of
the
people
and
to
have
it
sufficiently
well
paid
to
obtain
the
best
talent
he
wanted
it
held
in
the
highest
esteem
and
to
have
an
appointment
thereon
considered
one
of
the
greatest
honors
of
the
republic
to
do
this
he
knew
it
was
necessary
for
its
members
to
be
able
honest
temperate
and
considerate
chapter
xxx
a
new
code
of
laws
dru
selected
another
board
of
five
lawyers
and
to
them
he
gave
the
task
of
reforming
legal
procedure
and
of
pruning
down
the
existing
laws
both
state
and
national
cutting
out
the
obsolete
and
useless
ones
and
rewriting
those
recommended
to
be
retained
in
plain
and
direct
language
free
from
useless
legal
verbiage
and
understandable
to
the
ordinary
lay
citizen
he
then
created
another
board
of
even
greater
ability
to
read
digest
and
criticise
the
work
of
the
other
two
boards
and
report
their
findings
directly
to
him
giving
a
brief
summary
of
their
reasons
and
recommendations
to
assist
in
this
work
he
engaged
in
an
advisory
capacity
three
eminent
lawyers
from
england
germany
and
france
respectively
the
three
boards
were
urged
to
proceed
with
as
much
despatch
as
possible
for
dru
knew
that
it
would
take
at
least
several
years
to
do
it
properly
and
afterwards
he
would
want
to
place
the
new
code
of
laws
in
working
order
under
the
reformed
judiciary
before
he
would
be
content
to
retire
the
other
changes
he
had
in
mind
he
thought
could
be
accomplished
much
more
quickly
among
other
things
dru
directed
that
the
states
should
have
a
simplification
of
land
titles
so
that
transfers
of
real
estate
could
be
made
as
easy
as
the
transfer
of
stocks
and
with
as
little
expense
no
attorneys
fees
for
examination
of
titles
and
no
recording
fees
being
necessary
the
title
could
not
be
contested
after
being
once
registered
in
a
name
therefore
no
litigation
over
real
property
could
be
possible
it
was
estimated
by
dru
statisticians
that
in
some
states
this
would
save
the
people
annually
a
sum
equal
to
the
cost
of
running
their
governments
a
uniform
divorce
law
was
also
to
be
drawn
and
put
into
operation
so
that
the
scandals
arising
from
the
old
conditions
might
no
longer
be
possible
it
was
arranged
that
when
laws
affecting
the
states
had
been
written
before
they
went
into
effect
they
were
to
be
submitted
to
a
body
of
lawyers
made
up
of
one
representative
from
each
state
this
body
could
make
suggestions
for
such
additions
or
eliminations
as
might
seem
to
them
pertinent
and
conforming
with
conditions
existing
in
their
respective
commonwealths
but
the
board
was
to
use
its
judgment
in
the
matter
of
incorporating
the
suggestions
in
the
final
draft
of
the
law
it
was
not
the
administrator
purpose
to
rewrite
at
that
time
the
federal
and
state
constitutions
but
to
do
so
at
a
later
date
when
the
laws
had
been
rewritten
and
decided
upon
he
wished
to
first
satisfy
himself
as
to
them
and
their
adaptability
to
the
existing
conditions
and
then
make
a
constitution
conforming
with
them
this
would
seem
to
be
going
at
things
backward
but
it
recommended
itself
to
dru
as
the
sane
and
practical
way
to
have
the
constitutions
and
laws
in
complete
harmony
the
formation
of
the
three
boards
created
much
disturbance
among
judges
lawyers
and
corporations
but
when
the
murmur
began
to
assume
the
proportions
of
a
protest
general
dru
took
the
matter
in
hand
he
let
it
be
known
that
it
would
be
well
for
them
to
cease
to
foment
trouble
he
pointed
out
that
heretofore
the
laws
had
been
made
for
the
judges
for
the
lawyers
and
for
those
whose
financial
or
political
influence
enabled
them
to
obtain
special
privileges
but
that
hereafter
the
whole
legal
machinery
was
to
be
run
absolutely
in
the
interest
of
the
people
the
decisive
and
courageous
manner
in
which
he
handled
this
situation
brought
him
the
warm
and
generous
approval
of
the
people
and
they
felt
that
at
last
their
day
had
come
chapter
xxxi
the
question
of
taxation
the
question
of
taxation
was
one
of
the
most
complex
problems
with
which
the
administrator
had
to
deal
as
with
the
legal
machinery
he
formed
a
board
of
five
to
advise
with
him
and
to
carry
out
his
very
ideas
upon
this
board
was
a
political
economist
a
banker
who
was
thought
to
be
the
ablest
man
of
his
profession
a
farmer
who
was
a
very
successful
and
practical
man
a
manufacturer
and
a
congressman
who
for
many
years
had
been
the
consequential
member
of
the
ways
and
means
committee
all
these
men
were
known
for
their
breadth
of
view
and
their
interest
in
public
affairs
again
dru
went
to
england
france
and
germany
for
the
best
men
he
could
get
as
advisers
to
the
board
he
offered
such
a
price
for
their
services
that
eminent
as
they
were
they
did
not
feel
that
they
could
refuse
he
knew
the
best
were
the
cheapest
at
the
first
sitting
of
the
committee
dru
told
them
to
consider
every
existing
tax
law
obliterated
to
begin
anew
and
to
construct
a
revenue
system
along
the
lines
he
indicated
for
municipalities
counties
states
and
the
nation
he
did
not
contemplate
he
said
that
the
new
law
should
embrace
all
the
taxes
which
the
three
civil
divisions
could
levy
but
that
it
should
apply
only
where
taxes
related
to
the
general
government
nevertheless
dru
was
hopeful
that
such
a
system
would
be
devised
as
would
render
it
unnecessary
for
either
municipalities
counties
or
states
to
require
any
further
revenue
dru
directed
the
board
to
divide
each
state
into
districts
for
the
purpose
of
taxation
not
making
them
large
enough
to
be
cumbersome
and
yet
not
small
enough
to
prohibit
the
employment
of
able
men
to
form
the
assessment
and
collecting
boards
he
suggested
that
these
boards
be
composed
of
four
local
men
and
one
representative
of
the
nation
he
further
directed
that
the
tax
on
realty
both
in
the
country
and
the
city
should
be
upon
the
following
basis
improvements
on
city
property
were
to
be
taxed
at
of
their
value
and
the
naked
property
either
in
town
or
country
at
of
its
value
the
fact
that
country
property
used
for
agricultural
purposes
was
improved
should
not
be
reckoned
in
other
words
if
a
had
one
hundred
acres
with
eighty
acres
of
it
in
cultivation
and
otherwise
improved
and
b
had
one
hundred
acres
beside
him
of
just
as
good
land
but
not
in
cultivation
or
improved
b
land
should
be
taxed
as
much
as
a
in
cities
and
towns
taxation
was
to
be
upon
a
similar
basis
for
instance
when
there
was
a
lot
say
one
hundred
feet
by
one
hundred
feet
with
improvements
upon
it
worth
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
there
was
another
lot
of
the
same
size
and
value
the
improved
lot
should
be
taxed
only
sixty
thousand
more
than
the
unimproved
lot
that
is
both
lots
should
be
taxed
alike
and
the
improvement
on
the
one
should
be
assessed
at
sixty
thousand
dollars
or
of
its
actual
value
this
dru
pointed
out
would
deter
owners
from
holding
unimproved
realty
for
the
purpose
of
getting
the
unearned
increment
made
possible
by
the
thrift
of
their
neighbors
in
the
country
it
would
open
up
land
for
cultivation
now
lying
idle
provide
homes
for
more
people
cheapen
the
cost
of
living
to
all
and
make
possible
better
schools
better
roads
and
a
better
opportunity
for
the
successful
cooperative
marketing
of
products
in
the
cities
and
towns
it
would
mean
a
more
homogeneous
population
with
better
streets
better
sidewalks
better
sewerage
more
convenient
churches
and
cheaper
rents
and
homes
as
it
was
at
that
time
a
poor
man
could
not
buy
a
home
nor
rent
one
near
his
work
but
must
needs
go
to
the
outskirts
of
his
town
necessitating
loss
of
time
and
cost
of
transportation
besides
sacrificing
the
obvious
comforts
and
conveniences
of
a
more
compact
population
the
administrator
further
directed
the
tax
board
to
work
out
a
graduated
income
tax
exempting
no
income
whatsoever
incomes
up
to
one
thousand
dollars
a
year
dru
thought
should
bear
a
merely
nominal
tax
of
of
one
per
cent
those
of
from
one
to
two
thousand
one
per
cent
those
of
from
two
to
five
thousand
two
per
cent
those
of
from
five
to
ten
thousand
three
per
cent
those
of
from
ten
to
twenty
thousand
six
per
cent
the
tax
on
incomes
of
more
than
twenty
thousand
dollars
a
year
dru
directed
was
to
be
rapidly
increased
until
a
maximum
of
seventy
per
cent
was
to
be
reached
on
those
incomes
that
were
ten
million
dollars
or
above
false
returns
false
swearing
or
any
subterfuge
to
defraud
the
government
was
to
be
punished
by
not
less
than
six
months
or
more
than
two
years
in
prison
the
board
was
further
instructed
to
incorporate
in
their
tax
measure
an
inheritance
tax
clause
graduated
at
the
same
rate
as
in
the
income
tax
and
to
safeguard
the
defrauding
of
the
government
by
gifts
before
death
and
other
devices
chapter
xxxii
a
federal
incorporation
act
along
with
the
first
board
on
tax
laws
administrator
dru
appointed
yet
another
commission
to
deal
with
another
phase
of
this
subject
the
second
board
was
composed
of
economists
and
others
well
versed
in
matters
relating
to
the
tariff
and
internal
revenue
who
broadly
speaking
were
instructed
to
work
out
a
tariff
law
which
would
contemplate
the
abolishment
of
the
theory
of
protection
as
a
governmental
policy
a
tariff
was
to
be
imposed
mainly
as
a
supplement
to
the
other
taxes
the
revenue
from
which
it
was
thought
would
be
almost
sufficient
for
the
needs
of
the
government
considering
the
economies
that
were
being
made
dru
father
had
been
an
ardent
advocate
of
state
rights
and
the
administrator
had
been
reared
in
that
atmosphere
but
when
he
began
to
think
out
such
questions
for
himself
he
realized
that
density
of
population
and
rapid
afforded
by
electric
and
steam
railroads
motors
aeroplanes
telegraphs
and
telephones
were
to
all
practical
purposes
obliterating
state
lines
and
molding
the
country
into
a
homogeneous
nation
therefore
after
the
revolution
dru
saw
that
the
time
had
come
for
this
trend
to
assume
more
definite
form
and
for
the
national
government
to
take
upon
itself
some
of
the
functions
heretofore
exclusively
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
states
up
to
the
time
of
the
revolution
a
state
of
chaos
had
existed
for
instance
laws
relating
to
divorces
franchises
interstate
commerce
sanitation
and
many
other
things
were
different
in
each
state
and
nearly
all
were
inefficient
and
not
conducive
to
the
general
welfare
administrator
dru
therefore
concluded
that
the
time
had
come
when
a
measure
of
control
of
such
things
should
be
vested
in
the
central
government
he
therefore
proposed
enacting
into
the
general
laws
a
federal
incorporation
act
and
into
his
scheme
of
taxation
a
franchise
tax
that
would
not
be
more
burdensome
than
that
now
imposed
by
the
states
he
also
proposed
making
corporations
share
with
the
government
and
states
a
certain
part
of
their
net
earnings
public
service
corporations
to
a
greater
extent
than
others
dru
plan
contemplated
that
either
the
government
or
the
state
in
which
the
home
or
headquarters
of
any
corporation
was
located
was
to
have
representation
upon
the
boards
of
such
corporation
in
order
that
the
interests
of
the
national
state
or
city
government
could
be
protected
and
so
as
to
insure
publicity
in
the
event
it
was
needful
to
correct
abuses
he
had
incorporated
in
the
franchise
law
the
right
of
labor
to
have
one
representative
upon
the
boards
of
corporations
and
to
share
a
certain
percentage
of
the
earnings
above
their
wages
after
a
reasonable
per
cent
upon
the
capital
had
been
earned
footnote
see
what
can
do
below
in
turn
it
was
to
be
obligatory
upon
them
not
to
strike
but
to
submit
all
grievances
to
arbitration
the
law
was
to
stipulate
that
if
the
business
prospered
wages
should
be
high
if
times
were
dull
they
should
be
reduced
the
people
were
asked
to
curb
their
prejudice
against
corporations
it
was
promised
that
in
the
future
corporations
should
be
honestly
run
and
in
the
interest
of
the
stockholders
and
the
public
dru
expressed
the
hope
that
their
formation
would
be
welcomed
rather
than
discouraged
for
he
was
sure
that
under
the
new
law
it
would
be
more
to
the
public
advantage
to
have
business
conducted
by
corporations
than
by
individuals
in
a
private
capacity
in
the
taxation
of
real
estate
the
unfair
practice
of
taxing
it
at
full
value
when
mortgaged
and
then
taxing
the
holder
of
the
mortgage
was
to
be
abolished
the
same
was
to
be
true
of
bonded
indebtedness
on
any
kind
of
property
the
easy
way
to
do
this
was
to
tax
property
and
not
tax
the
evidence
of
debt
but
dru
preferred
the
other
method
that
of
taxing
the
property
less
the
debt
and
then
taxing
the
debt
wherever
found
his
reason
for
this
was
that
if
bonds
or
other
forms
of
debt
paid
no
taxes
it
would
have
a
tendency
to
make
investors
put
money
into
that
kind
of
security
even
though
the
interest
was
correspondingly
low
in
order
to
avoid
the
trouble
of
rendering
and
paying
taxes
on
them
this
he
thought
might
keep
capital
out
of
other
needful
enterprises
and
give
a
glut
of
money
in
one
direction
and
a
paucity
in
another
money
itself
was
not
to
be
taxed

was
then
done
in
so

states

the
railroad
problem
while
the
boards
and
commissions
appointed
by
administrator
dru
were
working
out
new
tax
tariff
and
revenue
laws
establishing
the
judiciary
and
legal
machinery
on
a
new
basis
and
revising
the
general
law
it
was
necessary
that
the
financial
system
of
the
country
also
should
be
reformed
dru
and
his
advisers
saw
the
difficulties
of
attacking
this
most
intricate
question
but
with
the
advice
and
assistance
of
a
commission
appointed
for
that
purpose
they
began
the
formulation
of
a
new
banking
law
affording
a
flexible
currency
bottomed
largely
upon
commercial
assets
the
real
wealth
of
the
nation
instead
of
upon
debt
as
formerly
this
measure
was
based
upon
the
english
french
and
german
plans
its
authors
taking
the
best
from
each
and
making
the
whole
conform
to
american
needs
and
conditions
dru
regarded
this
as
one
of
his
most
pressing
reforms
for
he
hoped
that
it
would
not
only
prevent
panics
as
formerly
but
that
its
final
construction
would
completely
destroy
the
credit
trust
the
greatest
the
most
far
reaching
and
under
evil
direction
the
most
pernicious
trust
of
all
while
in
this
connection
as
well
as
all
others
he
was
insistent
that
business
should
be
honestly
conducted
yet
it
was
his
purpose
to
throw
all
possible
safeguards
around
it
in
the
past
it
had
been
not
only
harassed
by
a
monetary
system
that
was
a
mere
patchwork
affair
and
entirely
inadequate
to
the
needs
of
the
times
but
it
had
been
constantly
threatened
by
tariff
railroad
and
other
legislation
calculated
to
cause
continued
disturbance
the
demagogue
had
added
to
the
confusion
and
altogether
legitimate
business
had
suffered
more
during
the
long
season
of
unrest
than
had
the
monopolies
dru
wanted
to
see
the
nation
prosper
as
he
knew
it
could
never
have
done
under
the
old
order
where
the
few
reaped
a
disproportionate
reward
and
to
this
end
he
spared
no
pains
in
perfecting
the
new
financial
system
in
the
past
the
railroads
and
a
few
industrial
monopolies
had
come
in
for
the
greatest
amount
of
abuse
and
prejudice
this
feeling
while
largely
just
in
his
opinion
had
done
much
harm
the
railroads
were
the
offenders
in
the
first
instance
he
knew
and
then
the
people
retaliated
and
in
the
end
both
the
capitalists
who
actually
furnished
the
money
to
build
the
roads
and
the
people
suffered
in
the
first
place
said
administrator
dru
to
his
counsel
during
the
discussion
of
the
new
financial
system
the
roads
were
built
dishonestly
money
was
made
out
of
their
construction
by
the
promoters
in
the
most
open
and
shameless
way
and
afterwards
bonds
and
stocks
were
issued
far
in
excess
of
the
fraudulent
cost
nor
did
the
iniquity
end
there
enterprises
were
started
some
of
a
public
nature
such
as
grain
elevators
and
cotton
compresses
in
which
the
officials
of
the
railroads
were
financially
interested
these
favored
concerns
received
rebates
and
better
shipping
facilities
than
their
competitors
and
competition
was
stifled
iron
mines
and
mills
lumber
mills
and
yards
coal
mines
and
yards
went
into
their
rapacious
maw
and
the
managers
considered
the
railroads
a
private
snap
and
public
be
damned
these
things
continued
dru
did
not
constitute
their
sole
offense
for
as
you
all
know
they
lobbied
through
legislatures
the
most
unconscionable
bills
giving
them
land
money
and
rights
to
further
exploit
the
public
but
the
thing
that
perhaps
aroused
resentment
most
was
their
failure
to
pay
just
claims
the
idea
in
the
old
days
as
you
remember
was
to
pay
nothing
and
make
it
so
expensive
to
litigate
that
one
would
prefer
to
suffer
an
injustice
rather
than
go
to
court
from
this
policy
was
born
the
claim
lawyer
who
financed
and
fought
through
the
courts
personal
injury
claims
until
it
finally
came
to
pass
that
in
loss
or
damage
suits
the
average
jury
would
decide
against
the
railroad
on
general
principles
in
such
cases
the
litigant
generally
got
all
he
claimed
and
the
railroad
was
mulcted
there
is
no
estimating
how
much
this
unfortunate
policy
cost
the
railroads
of
america
up
to
the
time
of
the
revolution
the
trouble
was
that
the
ultimate
loss
fell
not
on
those
who
inaugurated
it
but
upon
the
innocent
stock
and
bondholder
of
the
roads
while
the
problem
is
complicated
he
continued
its
solution
lies
in
the
new
financial
system
together
with
the
new
system
of
control
of
public
utilities
to
this
end
dru
laid
down
his
plans
by
which
public
service
corporations
should
be
honestly
openly
and
efficiently
run
so
that
the
people
should
have
good
service
at
a
minimum
cost
primarily
the
general
government
the
state
or
the
city
as
the
case
might
be
were
to
have
representation
on
the
directorate
as
previously
indicated
they
were
to
have
full
access
to
the
books
and
each
corporation
was
to
be
compelled
to
make
public
a
full
and
a
clear
report
giving
the
receipts
and
expenditures
including
salaries
paid
to
high
officials
these
corporations
were
also
to
be
under
the
control
of
national
and
state
commissions
while
the
nation
and
state
were
to
share
in
the
earnings
dru
demanded
that
the
investor
in
such
corporate
securities
should
have
reasonable
profits
and
the
fullest
protection
in
the
event
states
or
municipalities
attempted
to
deal
unfairly
with
them
as
had
heretofore
been
the
case
in
many
instances
the
administrator
insisted
upon
the
prohibition
of
franchise
to
holding
companies
of
whatsoever
character
in
the
past
he
declared
they
had
been
prolific
trust
breeders
and
those
existing
at
that
time
he
asserted
should
be
dissolved
under
the
new
law
as
dru
outlined
it
one
company
might
control
another
but
it
would
have
to
be
with
the
consent
of
both
the
state
and
federal
officials
having
jurisdiction
in
the
premises
and
it
would
have
to
be
clear
that
the
public
would
be
benefited
thereby
there
was
to
be
in
the
future
no
hiding
under
cover
for
everything
was
to
be
done
in
the
open
and
in
a
way
entirely
understandable
to
the
ordinary
layman
certain
of
the
public
service
corporations
dru
insisted
should
be
taken
over
bodily
by
the
national
government
and
accordingly
the
postmaster
general
was
instructed
to
negotiate
with
the
telegraph
and
telephone
companies
for
their
properties
at
a
fair
valuation
they
were
to
be
under
the
absolute
control
of
the
postoffice
department
and
the
people
were
to
have
the
transmission
of
all
messages
at
cost
just
as
they
had
their
written
ones
a
parcel
post
was
also
inaugurated
so
that
as
much
as
twelve
pounds
could
be
sent
at
cost

the
further
administrator
dru
carried
his
progress
of
reform
the
more
helpful
he
found
selwyn
dru
generous
treatment
of
him
had
brought
in
return
a
grateful
loyalty
one
stormy
night
after
selwyn
had
dined
with
dru
he
sat
contentedly
smoking
by
a
great
log
fire
in
the
library
of
the
small
cottage
which
dru
occupied
in
the
barracks
this
reminds
me
he
said
of
my
early
boyhood
and
of
the
fireplace
in
the
old
tavern
where
i
was
born
general
dru
had
long
wanted
to
know
of
selwyn
and
though
they
had
arranged
to
discuss
some
important
business
dru
urged
the
former
senator
to
tell
him
something
of
his
early
life
selwyn
consented
but
asked
that
the
lights
be
turned
off
so
that
there
would
be
only
the
glow
from
the
fire
in
order
that
it
might
seem
more
like
the
old
days
at
home
when
his
father
political
cronies
gathered
about
the
hearth
for
their
confidential
talks
and
this
was
selwyn
story
my
father
was
a
man
of
small
education
and
kept
a
tavern
on
the
outer
edge
of
philadelphia
i
was
his
only
child
my
mother
dying
in
my
infancy
there
was
a
bar
connected
with
the
house
and
it
was
a
rendezvous
for
the
politicians
of
our
ward
i
became
interested
in
politics
so
early
that
i
can
not
remember
the
time
when
i
was
not
my
father
was
a
temperate
man
and
able
and
i
have
often
wondered
since
that
he
was
content
to
end
his
days
without
trying
to
get
beyond
the
environments
of
a
small
tavern
he
was
sensitive
and
perhaps
his
lack
of
education
caused
him
to
hesitate
to
enter
a
larger
and
more
conspicuous
field
however
he
was
resolved
that
i
should
not
be
hampered
as
he
was
and
i
was
therefore
given
a
good
common
school
education
first
and
afterwards
sent
to
girard
college
where
i
graduated
the
youngest
of
my
class
much
to
my
father
delight
i
expressed
a
desire
to
study
law
for
it
seemed
to
us
both
that
this
profession
held
the
best
opportunity
open
to
me
my
real
purpose
in
becoming
a
lawyer
was
to
aid
me
in
politics
for
it
was
clear
to
both
my
father
and
me
that
i
had
an
unusual
aptitude
therefor
my
study
of
law
was
rather
cursory
than
real
and
did
not
lead
to
a
profound
knowledge
of
the
subject
but
it
was
sufficient
for
me
to
obtain
admittance
to
the
bar
and
it
was
not
long
young
as
i
was
before
my
father
influence
brought
me
a
practice
that
was
lucrative
and
which
required
but
little
legal
lore
at
that
time
the
ward
boss
was
a
man
by
the
name
of
marx
while
his
father
was
a
german
he
was
almost
wholly
irish
for
his
father
died
when
he
was
young
and
he
was
reared
by
a
masculine
masterful
though
ignorant
irish
mother
he
was
my
father
best
friend
and
there
were
no
secrets
between
them
they
seldom
paid
attention
to
me
and
i
was
rarely
dismissed
even
when
they
had
their
most
confidential
talks
in
this
way
i
early
learned
how
our
great
american
cities
are
looted
not
so
much
by
those
actually
in
power
for
they
are
of
less
consequence
than
the
more
powerful
men
behind
them
if
any
contract
of
importance
was
to
be
let
be
it
either
public
or
private
marx
and
his
satellites
took
their
toll
he
in
his
turn
had
to
account
to
the
man
above
the
city
boss
if
a
large
private
undertaking
was
contemplated
the
ward
boss
had
to
be
seen
and
consulted
as
to
the
best
contractors
and
it
was
understood
that
at
least
five
per
cent
more
than
the
work
was
worth
had
to
be
paid
otherwise
there
would
be
endless
trouble
and
delay
the
inspector
of
buildings
would
make
trouble
complaints
would
be
made
of
obstructing
the
streets
and
sidewalks
and
injunctions
would
be
issued
so
it
was
either
to
pay
or
not
construct
marx
provided
work
for
the
needy
loaned
money
to
the
poor
sick
and
disabled
gave
excursions
and
picnics
in
the
summer
for
all
of
this
others
paid
but
it
enabled
him
to
hold
the
political
control
of
the
ward
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
the
boss
above
him
demanded
that
the
councilmen
from
his
ward
should
be
men
who
would
do
his
bidding
without
question
the
city
boss
in
turn
trafficked
with
the
larger
public
contracts
and
with
the
granting
and
extensions
of
franchises
it
was
a
fruitful
field
for
there
was
none
above
him
with
whom
he
was
compelled
to
divide
the
state
boss
treated
the
city
bosses
with
much
consideration
for
he
was
more
or
less
dependent
upon
them
his
power
consisting
largely
of
the
sum
of
their
power
the
state
boss
dealt
in
larger
things
and
became
a
national
figure
he
was
more
circumspect
in
his
methods
for
he
had
a
wider
constituency
and
a
more
intelligent
opposition
the
local
bosses
were
required
to
send
to
the
legislature
loyal
party
men
who
did
not
question
the
leadership
of
the
state
boss
the
big
interests
preferred
having
only
one
man
to
deal
with
which
simplified
matters
consequently
they
were
strong
aids
in
helping
him
retain
his
power
any
measure
they
desired
passed
by
the
legislature
was
first
submitted
to
him
and
he
would
prune
it
until
he
felt
he
could
put
it
through
without
doing
too
great
violence
to
public
sentiment
the
citizens
at
large
do
not
scrutinize
measures
closely
they
are
too
busy
in
their
own
vineyards
to
bother
greatly
about
things
which
only
remotely
or
indirectly
concern
them
this
selfish
attitude
and
indifference
of
our
people
has
made
the
boss
and
his
methods
possible
the
big
interests
reciprocate
in
many
and
devious
ways
ways
subtle
enough
to
seem
not
dishonest
even
if
exposed
to
public
view
so
that
by
early
education
i
was
taught
to
think
that
the
despoliation
of
the
public
in
certain
ways
was
a
legitimate
industry
later
i
knew
better
but
i
had
already
started
my
plow
in
the
furrow
and
it
was
hard
to
turn
back
i
wanted
money
and
i
wanted
power
and
i
could
see
both
in
the
career
before
me
it
was
not
long
of
course
before
i
had
discernment
enough
to
see
that
i
was
not
being
employed
for
my
legal
ability
my
income
was
practically
made
from
retainers
and
i
was
seldom
called
upon
to
do
more
than
to
use
my
influence
so
that
my
client
should
remain
undisturbed
in
the
pursuit
of
his
business
be
it
legitimate
or
otherwise
young
as
i
was
marx
soon
offered
me
a
seat
in
the
council
it
was
my
first
proffer
of
office
but
i
declined
it
i
did
not
want
to
be
identified
with
a
body
for
which
i
had
such
a
supreme
contempt
my
aim
was
higher
marx
though
was
sincere
in
his
desire
to
further
my
fortunes
for
he
had
no
son
and
his
affection
for
my
father
and
me
was
genuine
i
frankly
told
him
the
direction
in
which
my
ambition
lay
and
he
promised
me
his
cordial
assistance
i
wanted
to
get
beyond
ward
politics
and
in
touch
with
the
city
boss
it
was
my
idea
that
if
i
could
maintain
myself
with
him
i
would
in
time
ask
him
to
place
me
within
the
influence
of
the
state
boss
where
my
field
of
endeavor
would
be
as
wide
as
my
abilities
would
justify
i
did
not
lose
my
identity
with
my
ward
but
now
my
work
covered
all
philadelphia
and
my
retainers
became
larger
and
more
numerous
for
i
was
within
the
local
sphere
of
the
big
interests
at
that
time
the
boss
was
a
man
by
the
name
of
hardy
he
was
born
in
the
western
part
of
the
state
but
came
to
philadelphia
when
a
boy
his
mother
having
married
the
second
time
a
man
named
metz
who
was
then
city
treasurer
and
who
afterwards
became
mayor
hardy
was
a
singular
man
for
a
boss
small
of
frame
with
features
almost
effeminate
and
with
anything
but
a
robust
constitution
he
did
a
prodigious
amount
of
work
he
was
not
only
taciturn
to
an
unusual
degree
but
he
seldom
wrote
or
replied
to
letters
yet
he
held
an
iron
grip
upon
the
organization
his
personal
appearance
and
quiet
manners
inspired
many
ambitious
underlings
to
try
to
dislodge
him
but
their
failure
was
signal
and
complete
he
had
what
was
perhaps
the
most
perfectly
organized
machine
against
which
any
municipality
had
ever
had
the
misfortune
to
contend
hardy
made
few
promises
and
none
of
them
rash
but
no
man
could
truthfully
say
that
he
ever
broke
one
i
feel
certain
that
he
would
have
made
good
his
spoken
word
even
at
the
expense
of
his
fortune
or
political
power
then
too
he
played
fair
and
his
henchmen
knew
it
he
had
no
favorites
whom
he
unduly
rewarded
at
the
expense
of
the
more
efficient
he
had
likes
and
dislikes
as
other
men
but
his
judgment
was
never
warped
by
that
success
meant
advancement
failure
meant
retirement
and
he
made
his
followers
play
fair
there
were
certain
rules
of
the
game
that
had
to
be
observed
and
any
infraction
thereof
meant
punishment
the
big
burly
fellows
he
had
under
him
felt
pride
in
his
physical
insignificance
and
in
the
big
brain
that
had
never
known
defeat
when
i
became
close
to
him
i
asked
him
why
he
had
never
expanded
that
he
must
have
felt
sure
that
he
could
have
spread
his
jurisdiction
throughout
the
state
and
that
the
labor
in
the
broader
position
must
be
less
than
in
the
one
he
occupied
his
reply
was
characteristic
of
the
man
he
said
he
was
not
where
he
was
from
choice
that
environment
and
opportunity
had
forced
him
into
the
position
he
occupied
but
that
once
there
he
owed
it
to
his
followers
to
hold
it
against
all
comers
he
said
that
he
would
have
given
it
up
long
ago
if
it
had
not
been
for
this
feeling
of
obligation
to
those
who
loved
and
trusted
him
to
desert
them
and
to
make
new
responsibilities
was
unthinkable
from
his
viewpoint
that
which
i
most
wondered
at
in
hardy
was
his
failure
to
comprehend
that
the
work
he
was
engaged
in
was
dishonest
i
led
cautiously
up
to
this
one
day
and
this
was
his
explanation
the
average
american
citizen
refuses
to
pay
attention
to
civic
affairs
contenting
himself
with
a
general
growl
at
the
tax
rate
and
the
character
and
inefficiency
of
public
officials
he
seldom
takes
the
trouble
necessary
to
form
the
government
to
suit
his
views
the
truth
is
he
has
no
cohesive
or
views
it
being
too
much
trouble
to
form
them
therefore
some
such
organization
as
ours
is
essential
being
essential
then
it
must
have
funds
with
which
to
proceed
and
the
men
devoting
their
lives
to
it
must
be
recompensed
so
the
system
we
use
is
the
best
that
can
be
devised
under
the
circumstances
it
is
like
the
tariff
and
internal
revenue
taxes
by
which
the
national
government
is
run
that
is
indirect
the
citizen
pays
but
he
does
not
know
when
he
pays
nor
how
much
he
is
paying
a
better
system
could
perhaps
be
devised
in
both
instances
but
this
can
not
be
done
until
the
people
take
a
keener
interest
in
their
public
affairs
hardy
was
not
a
rich
man
though
he
had
every
opportunity
of
being
so
he
was
not
avaricious
and
his
tastes
and
habits
were
simple
and
he
had
no
family
to
demand
the
extravagances
that
are
undermining
our
national
life
he
was
a
vegetarian
and
he
thought
and
perhaps
rightly
that
in
a
few
centuries
from
now
the
killing
of
animals
and
the
eating
of
their
corpses
would
be
regarded
in
the
same
way
as
we
now
think
of
cannibalism
he
divided
the
money
that
came
to
him
amongst
his
followers
and
this
was
one
of
the
mainsprings
of
his
power
all
things
considered
it
is
not
certain
but
that
he
gave
philadelphia
as
good
government
as
her
indifferent
citizens
deserved
chapter
xxxv
selwyn
story
continued
by
the
time
i
was
i
had
accumulated
what
seemed
to
me
then
a
considerable
fortune
and
i
had
furthermore
become
hardy
man
he
had
his
forces
divided
in
several
classes
of
choice
i
was
ranged
among
those
whose
duties
were
general
and
not
local
i
therefore
had
a
survey
of
the
city
as
a
whole
and
was
not
infrequently
in
touch
with
the
masters
of
the
state
at
large
hardy
concerned
himself
about
my
financial
welfare
to
the
extent
of
now
and
then
inquiring
whether
my
income
was
satisfactory
and
the
nature
of
it
i
assured
him
that
it
was
and
that
he
need
have
no
further
thought
of
me
in
that
connection
i
told
him
that
i
was
more
ambitious
to
advance
politically
than
financially
and
while
expressing
my
gratitude
for
all
he
had
done
for
me
and
my
keen
regret
at
the
thought
of
leaving
him
i
spoke
again
of
my
desire
to
enter
state
politics
some
six
years
before
i
had
married
the
daughter
of
a
state
senator
a
man
who
was
then
seeking
the
gubernatorial
nomination
on
my
account
hardy
gave
him
cordial
support
but
the
state
boss
had
other
plans
and
my
was
shelved
for
the
moment
as
the
boss
expressed
it
for
one
who
suited
his
purposes
better
both
hardy
my
and
their
friends
resented
this
action
because
the
man
selected
was
not
in
line
for
the
place
and
the
boss
was
not
conforming
to
the
rules
of
the
game
they
wanted
to
break
openly
and
immediately
but
i
advised
delay
until
we
were
strong
enough
to
overthrow
him
the
task
of
quietly
organizing
an
effective
opposition
to
the
state
boss
was
left
to
me
and
although
i
lost
no
time
it
was
a
year
before
i
was
ready
to
make
the
fight
in
the
meanwhile
the
boss
had
no
intimation
of
the
revolt
my
and
hardy
had
by
my
direction
complied
with
all
the
requests
that
he
made
upon
them
and
he
thought
himself
never
more
secure
i
went
to
the
legislature
that
year
in
accordance
with
our
plans
and
announced
myself
a
candidate
for
speaker
i
did
this
without
consulting
the
boss
and
purposely
he
had
already
selected
another
man
and
had
publicly
committed
himself
to
his
candidacy
which
was
generally
considered
equivalent
to
an
election
the
candidate
was
a
weak
man
and
if
the
boss
had
known
the
extent
of
the
opposition
that
had
developed
he
would
have
made
a
stronger
selection
as
it
was
he
threw
not
only
the
weight
of
his
own
influence
for
his
man
and
again
irrevocably
committed
himself
but
he
had
his
creature
the
governor
do
likewise
my
strength
was
still
not
apparent
for
i
had
my
forces
well
in
hand
and
while
i
had
a
few
declare
themselves
for
me
the
major
part
were
and
spoke
in
cautious
terms
of
general
approval
of
the
boss
candidate
the
result
was
a
sensation
i
was
elected
by
a
safe
though
small
majority
and
as
a
natural
result
the
boss
was
deposed
and
i
was
proclaimed
his
successor
i
had
found
in
organizing
the
revolt
that
there
were
many
who
had
grievances
which
from
fear
they
had
kept
hidden
but
when
they
were
shown
that
they
could
safely
be
revenged
they
eagerly
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
so
in
one
campaign
i
burst
upon
the
public
as
the
party
leader
and
the
question
was
now
how
would
i
use
it
and
could
i
hold
it
chapter

selwyn
story
continued
flushed
though
i
was
with
victory
and
with
the
flattery
of
friends
time
servers
and
sycophants
in
my
ears
i
felt
a
deep
sympathy
for
the
boss
he
was
as
a
sinking
ship
and
as
such
deserted
yesterday
a
thing
for
envy
an
object
of
pity
i
wondered
how
long
it
would
be
before
i
too
would
be
stranded
the
interests
were
of
course
among
the
first
to
congratulate
me
and
to
assure
me
of
their
support
during
that
session
of
the
legislature
i
did
not
change
the
character
of
the
legislation
or
do
anything
very
different
from
the
usual
i
wanted
to
feel
my
seat
more
firmly
under
me
before
attempting
the
many
things
i
had
in
mind
i
took
over
into
my
camp
all
those
that
i
could
reasonably
trust
and
strengthened
my
forces
everywhere
as
expeditiously
as
possible
i
weeded
out
the
incompetents
of
whom
there
were
many
and
replaced
them
by
loyal
and
energetic
men
who
had
easy
consciences
when
it
came
to
dealing
with
the
public
affairs
of
either
municipalities
counties
or
the
state
of
necessity
i
had
to
use
some
who
were
vicious
and
dishonest
and
who
would
betray
me
in
a
moment
if
their
interests
led
that
way
but
of
these
there
were
few
in
my
personal
organization
though
from
experience
i
knew
their
kind
permeated
the
municipal
machines
to
a
large
degree
the
lessons
learned
from
hardy
were
of
value
to
me
now
i
was
liberal
to
my
following
at
the
expense
of
myself
and
i
played
the
game
fair
as
they
knew
it
i
declined
to
the
next
legislature
because
the
office
was
not
commensurate
with
the
dignity
of
the
position
i
held
as
party
leader
and
again
because
the
holding
of
state
office
was
now
a
perilous
undertaking
in
taking
over
the
machine
from
the
late
boss
and
in
molding
it
into
an
almost
personal
following
i
found
it
not
only
loosely
put
together
but
inefficient
for
my
more
ambitious
purposes
after
giving
it
four
or
five
years
of
close
attention
i
was
satisfied
with
it
and
i
had
no
fear
of
dislodgment
i
had
found
that
the
interests
were
not
paying
anything
like
a
commensurate
amount
for
the
special
privileges
they
were
getting
and
i
more
than
doubled
the
revenue
obtained
by
the
deposed
boss
this
of
course
delighted
my
henchmen
and
bound
them
more
closely
to
me
i
also
demanded
and
received
information
in
advance
of
any
extensions
of
railroads
standard
or
interurban
of
contemplated
improvements
of
whatsoever
character
and
i
doled
out
this
information
to
those
of
my
followers
in
whose
jurisdiction
lay
such
territory
my
own
fortune
i
augmented
by
advance
information
regarding
the
appreciation
of
stocks
if
an
amalgamation
of
two
important
institutions
was
to
occur
or
if
they
were
to
be
put
upon
a
dividend
basis
or
if
the
dividend
rate
was
to
be
increased
i
was
told
not
only
in
advance
of
the
public
but
in
advance
of
the
stockholders
themselves
all
such
information
i
held
in
confidence
even
from
my
own
followers
for
it
was
given
me
with
such
understanding
my
next
move
was
to
get
into
national
politics
i
became
something
of
a
factor
at
the
national
convention
by
swinging
pennsylvania
vote
at
a
critical
time
the
result
being
the
nomination
of
the
now
president
consequently
my
relations
with
him
were
most
cordial
the
term
of
the
senior
senator
from
our
state
was
about
to
expire
and
although
he
was
well
advanced
in
years
he
desired
i
decided
to
take
his
seat
for
myself
so
i
asked
the
president
to
offer
him
an
ambassadorship
he
did
not
wish
to
make
the
change
but
when
he
understood
that
it
was
that
or
nothing
he
gracefully
acquiesced
in
order
that
he
might
be
saved
the
humiliation
of
defeat
when
he
resigned
the
governor
offered
me
the
appointment
for
the
unexpired
term
it
had
only
three
months
to
run
before
the
legislature
met
to
elect
his
successor
i
told
him
that
i
could
not
accept
until
i
had
conferred
with
my
friends
i
had
no
intention
of
refusing
but
i
wanted
to
seem
to
defer
to
the
judgment
of
my
lieutenants
i
called
them
to
the
capital
singly
and
explained
that
i
could
be
of
vastly
more
service
to
the
organization
were
i
at
washington
and
i
arranged
with
them
to
convert
the
rank
and
file
to
this
view
each
felt
that
the
weight
of
my
decision
rested
upon
himself
and
their
vanity
was
greatly
pleased
i
was
begged
not
to
renounce
the
leadership
and
after
persuasion
this
i
promised
not
to
do
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
never
my
intention
to
release
my
hold
upon
the
state
thus
placing
myself
in
another
power
so
i
accepted
the
tender
of
the
senatorship
and
soon
after
when
the
legislature
met
i
was
elected
for
the
full
term
i
was
in
as
close
touch
with
my
state
at
washington
as
i
was
before
for
i
spent
a
large
part
of
my
time
there
i
was
not
in
washington
long
before
i
found
that
the
government
was
run
by
a
few
men
that
outside
of
this
little
circle
no
one
was
of
much
importance
it
was
my
intention
to
break
into
it
if
possible
and
my
ambition
now
leaped
so
far
as
to
want
not
only
to
be
of
it
but
later
to
be
it
i
began
my
crusade
by
getting
upon
confidential
terms
with
the
president
one
night
when
we
were
alone
in
his
private
study
i
told
him
of
the
manner
and
completeness
of
my
organization
in
pennsylvania
i
could
see
he
was
deeply
impressed
he
had
been
elected
by
an
uncomfortably
small
vote
and
he
was
i
knew
looking
for
someone
to
manage
the
next
campaign
provided
he
again
received
the
nomination
the
man
who
had
done
this
work
in
the
last
election
was
broken
in
health
and
had
gone
to
europe
for
an
indefinite
stay
the
president
questioned
me
closely
and
ended
by
asking
me
to
undertake
the
direction
of
his
campaign
for
and
later
to
manage
the
campaign
for
his
election
in
the
event
he
was
again
the
candidate
i
was
flattered
by
the
proffer
and
told
him
so
but
i
was
guarded
in
its
acceptance
i
wanted
him
to
see
more
of
me
hear
more
of
my
methods
and
to
become
as
it
were
the
suppliant
this
condition
was
soon
brought
about
and
i
entered
into
my
new
relations
with
him
under
the
most
favorable
circumstances
if
i
had
readily
acquiesced
he
would
have
assumed
the
air
of
favoring
me
as
it
was
the
rule
was
reversed
he
was
overwhelmingly
nominated
and
and
for
the
result
he
generously
gave
me
full
credit
i
was
now
well
within
the
charmed
circle
and
within
easy
reach
of
my
further
desire
to
have
no
rivals
this
came
about
naturally
and
without
friction
the
interests
of
course
were
soon
groveling
at
my
feet
and
heavy
as
my
demands
were
i
sometimes
wondered
like
clive
at
my
own
moderation
the
rest
of
my
story
is
known
to
you
i
had
tightened
a
nearly
invisible
coil
around
the
people
which
held
them
fast
while
the
interests
despoiled
them
we
overdid
it
and
you
came
with
the
conscience
of
the
great
majority
of
the
american
people
back
of
you
and
swung
the
nation
again
into
the
moorings
intended
by
the
fathers
of
the
republic

finished

burned

it

and
then
that
his
face
was
lighted
by
the
flickering
flames
revealing
a
sadness
that
few
had
ever
seen
there
before
perhaps
he
saw
in
the
dying
embers
something
typical
of
his
life
as
it
now
was
perhaps
he
longed
to
recall
his
youth
and
with
it
the
strength
the
nervous
force
and
the
tireless
thought
that
he
had
used
to
make
himself
what
he
was
when
life
is
so
nearly
spilled
as
his
things
are
measured
differently
and
what
looms
large
in
the
beginning
becomes
but
the
merest
shadow
when
the
race
has
been
run
as
he
contemplated
the
silent
figure

dru
felt
something
of
regret
himself
for
he
now
knew
the
groundwork
of
the
man
and
he
was
sure
that
under
other
conditions
a
career
could
have
been
wrought
more
splendid
than
that

any

of

of
making

and
should

an
immediate
enforcement
of
this
law
was
made
because
just
before
the

there
was
carried
to
a
successful
conclusion
a
gigantic
but
iniquitous
cotton
corner
some
twenty
or
more
adventurous
millionaires
led
by
one
of
the
boldest
speculators
of
those
times
named
hawkins
planned
and
succeeded
in
cornering
cotton
it
seemed
that
the
world
needed
a
crop
of
bales
and
while
the
yield
for
the
year
was
uncertain
it
appeared
that
the
crop
would
run
to
that
figure
and
perhaps
over
therefore
prices
were
low
and
was
selling
around
eight
cents
and
futures
for
the
distant
months
were
not
much
higher
by
using
all
the
markets
and
exchanges
and
by
exercising
much
skill
and
secrecy
hawkins
succeeded
in
buying
two
million
bales
of
actual
cotton
and
ten
million
bales
of
futures
at
an
approximate
average
of
nine
and
a
half
cents
he
had
the
actual
cotton
stored
in
relatively
small
quantities
throughout
the
south
much
of
it
being
on
the
farms
and
at
the
gins
where
it
was
bought
then
in
order
to
hide
his
identity
he
had
incorporated
a
company
called
the
farmers
protective
association
through
one
of
his
agents
he
succeeded
in
officering
it
with
southerners
who
knew
only
that
part
of
the
plan
which
contemplated
an
increase
in
prices
and
were
in
sympathy
with
it
he
transferred
his
to
this
company
the
stock
of
which
he
himself
held
through
his
dummies
then
had
his
agents
burn
the
entire
two
million
the
burning
was
done
quickly
and
with
spectacular
effect
and
the
entire
commercial
world
both
in
america
and
abroad
were
astounded
by
the
act
once
before
in
isolated
instances
the
cotton
planter
had
done
this
and
once
the
farmers
of
the
west
discouraged
by
low
prices
had
used
corn
for
fuel
that
however
was
done
on
a
small
scale
but
to
deliberately
burn
one
hundred
million
dollars
worth
of
property
was
almost
beyond
the
scope
of
the
imagination
the
result
was
a
cotton
panic
and
hawkins
succeeded
in
closing
out
his
futures
at
an
average
price
of
fifteen
cents
thereby
netting
dollars
a

and
making
for

end
of
the
first
quarter
of

twenty
of
the
states
had
woman
suffrage
and
administrator
dru
decided
to
give
it
to
the
nation
in
those
twenty
states
as
far
as
he
had
observed
there
had
been
no
change
for
the
better
in
the
general
laws
nor
did
the
officials
seem
to
have
higher
standards
of
efficiency
than
in
those
states
that
still
denied
to
women
the
right
to
vote
but
he
noticed
that
there
were
more
special
laws
bearing
on
the
moral
and
social
side
of
life
and
that
police
regulation
was
better
upon
the
whole
dru
thought
the
result
warranted
universal
franchise
without
distinction
of
race
color
or
sex
he
believed
that
up
to
the
present
time
a
general
franchise
had
been
a
mistake
and
that
there
should
have
been
restrictions
and
qualifications
but
education
had
become
so
general
and
the
condition
of
the
people
had
advanced
to
such
an
extent
that
it
was
now
warranted
it
had
long
seemed
to
dru
absurd
that
the
ignorant
and
as
a
rule
more
immoral
male
should
have
such
an
advantage
over
the
educated
refined
and
intelligent
female
where
laws
discriminated
at
all
it
was
almost
always
against
rather
than
in
favor
of
women
and
this
was
true
to
a
much
greater
extent
in
europe
and
elsewhere
than
in
the
united
states
dru
had
a
profound
sympathy
for
the
effort
women
were
making
to
get
upon
an
equality
with
men
in
the
race
for
life
and
he
believed
that
with
the
franchise
would
come
equal
opportunity
and
equal
pay
for
the
same
work
america
he
hoped
might
again
lead
in
the
uplift
of
the
sex
and
the
example
would
be
a
distinct
gain
to
women
in
those
less
forward
countries
where
they
were
still
largely
considered
as
inferior
to
and
somewhat
as
chattels
to
man
then
too
dru
had
an
infinite
pity
for
the
dependent
and
submerged
life
of
the
generality
of
women
man
could
ask
woman
to
mate
but
women
were
denied
this
privilege
and
even
when
mated
oftentimes
a
life
of
never
ending
drudgery
followed
dru
believed
that
if
women
could
ever
become
economically
independent
of
man
it
would
to
a
large
degree
mitigate
the
social
evil
they
would
then
no
longer
be
compelled
to
marry
or
be
a
charge
upon
unwilling
relatives
or
as
in
desperation
they
sometimes

a
negative
government
upon
assuming
charge
of
the
affairs
of
the
republic
the
administrator
had
largely
retained
the
judiciary
as
it
was
then
constituted
and
he
also
made
but
few
changes
in
the
personnel
of
state
and
federal
officials
therefore
there
had
as
yet
been
no
confusion
in
the
public
business
everything
seemed
about
as
usual
further
than
there
were
no
legislative
bodies
sitting
and
the
function
of
law
making
was
confined
to
one
individual
the
administrator
himself
before
putting
the
proposed
laws
into
force
he
wished
them
thoroughly
worked
out
and
digested
in
the
meantime
however
he
was
constantly
placing
before
his
cabinet
and
commissioners
suggestions
looking
to
the
betterment
of
conditions
and
he
directed
that
these
suggestions
should
be
molded
into
law
in
order
that
the
people
might
know
what
further
measures
he
had
in
mind
for
their
welfare
other
than
those
already
announced
he
issued
the
following
address
it
is
my
purpose
said
he
not
to
give
to
you
any
radical
or
laws
i
wish
rather
to
cull
that
which
is
best
from
the
other
nations
of
the
earth
and
let
you
have
the
benefit
of
their
thought
and
experience
one
of
the
most
enlightened
foreign
students
of
our
government
has
rightly
said
that
is
the
most
undemocratic
of
democratic
countries
we
have
been
living
under
a
government
of
negation
a
government
with
an
executive
with
more
power
than
any
monarch
a
government
having
a
supreme
court
clothed
with
greater
authority
than
any
similar
body
on
earth
therefore
we
have
lagged
behind
other
nations
in
democracy
our
government
is
perhaps
less
responsive
to
the
will
of
the
people
than
that
of
almost
any
of
the
civilized
nations
our
constitution
and
our
laws
served
us
well
for
the
first
hundred
years
of
our
existence
but
under
the
conditions
of
they
are
not
only
obsolete
but
even
grotesque
it
is
nearly
impossible
for
the
desires
of
our
people
to
find
expression
into
law
in
the
latter
part
of
the
last
century
many
will
remember
that
an
income
tax
was
wanted
after
many
vicissitudes
a
measure
embodying
that
idea
was
passed
by
both
houses
of
congress
and
was
signed
by
the
executive
but
that
did
not
give
to
us
an
income
tax
the
supreme
court
found
the
law
unconstitutional
and
we
have
been
vainly
struggling
since
to
obtain
relief
if
a
majority
of
the
people
of
england
of
france
of
italy
or
of
germany
had
wanted
such
a
law
they
could
have
gotten
it
with
reasonable
celerity
our
house
of
representatives
is
supposed
to
be
our
popular
body
and
yet
its
members
do
not
convene
until
a
year
and
one
month
from
the
time
they
are
elected
no
matter
how
pressing
the
issue
upon
which
a
majority
of
them
are
chosen
more
than
a
year
must
elapse
before
they
may
begin
their
endeavors
to
carry
out
the
will
of
the
people
when
a
bill
covering
the
question
at
issue
is
finally
introduced
in
the
house
it
is
referred
to
a
committee
and
that
body
may
hold
it
at
its
pleasure
if
in
the
end
the
house
should
pass
the
bill
that
probably
becomes
the
end
of
it
for
the
senate
may
kill
it
if
the
measure
passes
the
senate
it
is
only
after
it
has
again
been
referred
to
a
committee
and
then
back
to
a
conference
committee
of
both
senate
and
house
and
returned
to
each
for
final
passage
when
all
this
is
accomplished
at
a
single
session
it
is
unusually
expeditious
for
measures
no
matter
how
important
are
often
carried
over
for
another
year
if
it
should
at
last
pass
both
house
and
senate
there
is
the
executive
veto
to
be
considered
if
however
the
president
signs
the
bill
and
it
becomes
a
law
it
is
perhaps
but
for
the
supreme
court
is
ever
present
with
its
damoclean
sword
these
barriers
and
interminable
delays
have
caused
the
demand
for
the
initiative
referendum
and
recall
that
clumsy
weapon
was
devised
in
some
states
largely
because
the
people
were
becoming
restless
and
wanted
a
more
responsive
government
i
am
sure
that
i
shall
be
able
to
meet
your
wishes
in
a
much
simpler
way
and
yet
throw
sufficient
safeguards
around
the
new
system
to
keep
it
from
proving
hurtful
should
an
attack
of
political
hysteria
overtake
you
however
there
has
never
been
a
time
in
our
history
when
a
majority
of
our
people
have
not
thought
right
on
the
public
questions
that
came
before
them
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
they
will
think
wrong
now
the
interests
want
a
government
hedged
with
restrictions
such
as
we
have
been
living
under
and
it
is
easy
to
know
why
with
the
example
of
the
last
administration
fresh
in
the
minds
of
all
a
very
distinguished
lawyer
once
ambassador
to
great
britain
is
reported
as
saying
on
lincoln
birthday
constitution
is
an
instrument
designedly
drawn
by
the
founders
of
this
government
providing
safeguards
to
prevent
any
inroads
by
popular
excitement
or
frenzy
of
the
moment
and
later
in
the
speech
he
says
i
have
faith
in
the
sober
judgment
of
the
american
people
that
they
will
reject
these
radical
changes
etc
if
he
had
faith
in
the
sober
judgment
of
the
american
people
why
not
trust
them
to
a
measurable
extent
with
the
conduct
of
their
own
affairs
the
english
people
for
a
century
or
more
have
had
such
direction
as
i
now
propose
that
you
shall
have
and
for
more
than
half
a
century
the
french
people
have
had
like
power
they
have
in
no
way
abused
it
and
yet
the
english
and
french
electorate
surely
are
not
more
intelligent
or
have
better
or
more
sober
judgment
than
the
american
citizenship
another
thing
to
which
i
desire
your
attention
called
is
the
dangerous
power
possessed
by
the
president
in
the
past
but
of
which
the
new
constitution
will
rob
him
the
framers
of
the
old
constitution
lived
in
an
atmosphere
of
autocracy
and
they
could
not
know
as
we
do
now
the
danger
of
placing
in
one
man
hands
such
enormous
power
and
have
him
so
far
from
the
reach
of
the
people
that
before
they
could
dispossess
him
he
might
if
conditions
were
favorable
establish
a
dynasty
it
is
astounding
that
we
have
allowed
a
century
and
a
half
go
by
without
limiting
both
his
term
and
his
power
in
addition
to
giving
you
a
new
constitution
and
laws
that
will
meet
existing
needs
there
are
many
other
things
to
be
done
some
of
which
i
shall
briefly
outline
i
have
arranged
to
have
a
survey
made
of
the
swamp
lands
throughout
the
united
states
from
reliable
data
which
i
have
gathered
i
am
confident
that
an
area
as
large
as
the
state
of
ohio
can
be
reclaimed
and
at
a
cost
that
will
enable
the
government
to
sell
it
to
for
less
than
what
they
would
have
to
pay
elsewhere
for
similar
land
under
my
personal
direction
i
am
having
prepared
an
pension
law
and
also
a
laborers
insurance
law
covering
loss
in
cases
of
illness
incapacity
and
death
i
have
a
commission
working
on
an
efficient
cooperative
system
of
marketing
the
products
of
small
farms
and
factories
the
small
producers
throughout
america
are
not
getting
a
sufficient
return
for
their
products
largely
because
they
lack
the
facilities
for
marketing
them
properly
by
cooperation
they
will
be
placed
upon
an
equal
footing
with
the
large
producers
and
small
investments
that
heretofore
have
given
but
a
meager
return
will
become
profitable
i
am
also
planning
to
inaugurate
cooperative
loan
societies
in
every
part
of
the
union
and
i
have
appointed
a
commissioner
to
instruct
the
people
as
to
their
formation
and
conduct
and
to
explain
their
beneficent
results
in
many
parts
of
europe
such
societies
have
reached
very
high
proficiency
and
have
been
the
means
of
bringing
prosperity
to
communities
that
before
their
establishment
had
gone
into
decay
many
hundred
millions
of
dollars
have
been
loaned
through
these
societies
and
while
only
a
fractional
part
of
their
members
would
be
considered
good
for
even
the
smallest
amount
at
a
bank
the
losses
to
the
societies
on
loans
to
their
members
have
been
almost
negligible
less
indeed
than
regular
bankers
could
show
on
loans
to
their
clients
and
yet
it
enables
those
that
are
almost
totally
without
capital
to
make
a
fair
living
for
themselves
and
families
it
is
my
purpose
to
establish
bureaus
through
the
congested
portions
of
the
united
states
where
men
and
women
in
search
of
employment
can
register
and
be
supplied
with
information
as
to
where
and
what
kind
of
work
is
obtainable
and
if
no
work
is
to
be
had
i
shall
arrange
that
every
indigent
person
that
is
honest
and
industrious
be
given
employment
by
the
federal
state
county
or
municipal
government
as
the
case
may
furthermore
it
shall
in
the
future
be
unlawful
for
any
employer
of
labor
to
require
more
than
eight
hours
work
a
day
and
then
only
for
six
days
a
week
conditions
as
are
now
found
in
the
great
manufacturing
centers
where
employés
are
worked
twelve
hours
a
day
seven
days
in
the
week
and
receive
wages
inadequate
for
even
an
eight
hour
day
shall
be
no
longer
possible
if
an
attempt
is
made
to
reduce
wages
because
of
shorter
hours
or
for
any
other
cause
the
employé
shall
have
the
right
to
go
before
a
magistrate
and
demand
that
the
amount
of
wage
be
adjusted
there
either
by
the
magistrate
himself
or
by
a
jury
if
demanded
by
either
party
where
there
are
a
large
number
of
employés
affected
they
can
act
through
their
unions
or
societies
if
needs
be
and
each
party
at
issue
may
select
an
arbitrator
and
the
two
so
chosen
may
agree
upon
a
third
or
they
may
use
the
courts
and
juries
as
may
be
preferred
this
law
shall
be
applicable
to
women
as
well
as
to
men
and
to
every
kind
of
labor
i
desire
to
make
it
clear
that
the
policy
of
this
government
is
that
every
man
or
woman
who
desires
work
shall
have
it
even
if
the
government
has
to
give
it
and
i
wish
it
also
understood
that
an
adequate
wage
must
be
paid
for
labor
labor
is
no
longer
to
be
classed
as
an
inert
commodity
to
be
bought
and
sold
by
the
law
of
supply
and
demand
but
the
equation
shall
hereafter
be
the
commanding
force
in
all
agreements
between
man
and
there
is
another
matter
to
which
i
shall
give
my
earnest
attention
and
that
is
the
reformation
of
the
study
and
practice
of
medicine
it
is
well
known
that
we
are
far
behind
england
germany
and
france
in
the
protection
of
our
people
from
incompetent
physicians
and
quackery
there
is
no
more
competent
no
more
intelligent
or
advanced
men
in
the
world
than
our
american
physicians
and
surgeons
of
the
first
class
but
the
incompetent
men
measurably
drag
down
the
high
standing
of
the
profession
a
large
part
of
our
medical
schools
and
colleges
are
entirely
unfit
for
the
purposes
intended
and
each
year
they
grant
diplomas
to
hundreds
of
ignorant
young
men
and
women
and
license
them
to
prey
upon
a
more
or
less
helpless
people
the
number
of
physicians
per
inhabitant
is
already
ridiculously
large
many
times
more
than
is
needful
or
than
other
countries
where
the
average
of
the
professions
ranks
higher
deem
necessary
i
feel
sure
that
the
death
list
in
the
united
states
from
the
mistakes
of
these
incompetents
is
simply
appalling
i
shall
create
a
board
of
five
eminent
men
two
of
whom
shall
be
physicians
one
shall
be
a
surgeon
one
a
scientist
and
the
other
shall
be
a
great
educator
and
to
this
board
i
shall
give
the
task
of
formulating
a
plan
by
which
the
spurious
medical
colleges
and
medical
men
can
be
eradicated
from
our
midst
i
shall
call
the
board
attention
to
the
fact
that
it
is
of
as
much
importance
to
have
men
of
fine
natural
ability
as
it
is
to
give
them
good
training
and
if
it
is
practicable
i
shall
ask
them
to
require
some
sort
of
adequate
mental
examination
that
will
measurably
determine
this
i
have
a
profound
admiration
for
the
courage
the
nobility
and
philanthropy
of
the
profession
as
a
whole
and
i
do
not
want
its
honor
tarnished
by
those
who
are
mercenary
and
unworthy
in
conclusion
i
want
to
announce
that
pensions
will
be
given
to
those
who
fought
on
either
side
in
the
late
war
without
distinction
or
reservation
however
it
is
henceforth
to
be
the
policy
of
this
government
so
far
as
i
may
be
able
to
shape
it
that
only
those
in
actual
need
of
financial
aid
shall
receive
pensions
and
to
them
it
shall
be
given
whether
they
have
or
have
not
been
disabled
in
consequence
of
their
services
to
the
nation
but
to
offer
financial
aid
to
the
rich
and
well
to
do
is
to
offer
an
insult
for
it
questions
their
patriotism
although
the
first
civil
war
was
ended
over
sixty
years
ago
yet
that
pension
roll
still
draws
heavily
upon
the
revenue
of
the
nation
its
history
has
been
a
rank
injustice
to
the
noble
armies
of
grant
and
his
lieutenants
the
glory
of
whose
achievements
is
now
the
common
heritage
of
a
united
country
chapter
xl
a
departure
in
battleships
dru
invited
the
strawns
to
accompany
him
to
newport
news
to
witness
the
launching
of
a
new
type
of
battleship
it
was
said
to
be
and
probably
was
impenetrable
experts
who
had
tested
a
model
built
on
a
large
scale
had
declared
that
this
invention
would
render
obsolete
every
battleship
in
existence
the
principle
was
this
running
back
from
the
bow
for
a
distance
of
feet
only
about
feet
of
the
hull
showed
above
the
water
line
and
this
part
of
the
deck
was
concaved
and
of
the
smoothest
hardest
steel
then
came
several
turreted
sections
upon
which
guns
were
mounted
around
these
turrets
ran
rims
of
polished
steel
two
feet
in
width
and
six
inches
thick
these
rims
began
four
feet
from
the
water
line
and
ran
four
feet
above
the
level
of
the
turret
decks
the
rims
were
so
nicely
adjusted
with
ball
bearings
that
the
smallest
blow
would
send
them
spinning
around
therefore
a
shell
could
not
penetrate
because
it
would
glance
off
although
the
trip
to
the
newport
news
dock
yards
was
made
in
a
navy
hydroaeroplane
it
took
several
hours
and
gloria
used
the
occasion
to
urge
upon
dru
the
rectification
of
some
abuses
of
which
she
had
special
knowledge
philip
she
said
when
i
was
proselytizing
among
the
rich
it
came
to
me
to
include
the
employer
of
women
labor
i
found
but
few
who
dissented
from
my
statement
of
facts
but
the
answer
was
that
trade
conditions
the
demand
of
customers
for
cheaper
garments
and
articles
made
relief
impracticable
perhaps
their
profits
are
on
a
narrow
basis
philip
but
the
volume
of
their
business
is
the
touchstone
of
their
success
for
how
otherwise
could
so
many
become
millionaires
just
what
the
remedy
is
i
do
not
know
but
i
want
to
give
you
the
facts
so
that
in
recasting
the
laws
you
may
plan
something
to
alleviate
a
grievous
wrong
it
is
strange
gloria
how
often
your
mind
and
mine
are
caught
by
the
same
current
and
how
they
drift
in
the
same
direction
it
was
only
a
few
days
ago
that
i
picked
up
one
of
henry
books
in
his
story
he
tells
of
a
man
who
dreamed
that
he
died
and
was
standing
with
a
crowd
of
prosperous
looking
angels
before
saint
peter
when
a
policeman
came
up
and
taking
him
by
the
wing
asked
you
with
that
bunch
are
they
asked
the
man
said
the
policeman
are
the
men
who
hired
working
girls
and
paid
five
or
six
dollars
a
week
to
live
on
are
you
one
of
the
bunch
on
your
immortality
answered
the
man
only
the
fellow
who
set
fire
to
an
orphan
asylum
and
murdered
a
blind
man
for
his
pennies
some
years
ago
when
i
first
read
that
story
i
thought
it
was
humor
now
i
know
it
to
be

xliii
the
rule
of
the
bosses
general
dru
was
ever
fond
of
talking
to
senator
selwyn
he
found
his
virile
mind
a
source
of
information
busy
as
they
both
were
they
often
met
and
exchanged
opinions
in
answer
to
a
question
from
dru
selwyn
said
that
while
pennsylvania
and
a
few
other
states
had
been
more
completely
under
the
domination
of
bosses
than
others
still
the
system
permeated
everywhere
in
some
states
a
railroad
held
the
power
but
exercised
it
through
an
individual
or
individuals
in
another
state
a
single
corporation
held
it
and
yet
again
it
was
often
held
by
a
corporate
group
acting
together
in
many
states
one
individual
dominated
public
affairs
and
more
often
for
good
than
for
evil
the
people
simply
would
not
take
enough
interest
in
their
government
to
exercise
the
right
of
control
those
who
took
an
active
interest
were
used
as
a
part
of
the
tools
be
he
a
benevolent
one
or
otherwise
the
delegates
go
to
the
conventions
said
selwyn
and
think
they
have
something
to
do
with
the
naming
of
the
nominees
and
the
making
of
the
platforms
but
the
astute
boss
has
planned
all
that
far
in
advance
the
candidates
are
selected
and
the
platform
written
and
both
are
upon
the
unsuspecting
delegate
much
as
the
card
shark
forced
his
cards
upon
his
victim
it
is
all
seemingly
in
the
open
and
above
the
boards
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
quite
the
reverse
is
true
at
conventions
it
is
usual
to
select
some
man
who
has
always
been
honored
and
respected
and
elect
him
chairman
of
the
platform
committee
he
is
pleased
with
the
honor
and
is
ready
to
do
the
bidding
of
the
man
to
whom
he
owes
it
the
platform
has
been
read
to
him
and
he
has
been
committed
to
it
before
his
appointment
as
chairman
then
a
careful
selection
is
made
of
delegates
from
the
different
senatorial
districts
and
a
good
working
majority
of
trusted
followers
is
obtained
for
places
on
the
committee
someone
nominates
for
chairman
the
and
respected
and
he
is
promptly
elected
another
member
suggests
that
the
committee
as
it
stands
is
too
unwieldy
to
draft
a
platform
and
makes
a
motion
that
the
chairman
be
empowered
to
appoint
a
of
five
to
outline
one
and
submit
it
to
the
committee
as
a
whole
the
motion
is
carried
and
the
chairman
appoints
five
of
the
and
true
there
is
then
an
adjournment
until
the
is
ready
to
report
the
five
betake
themselves
to
a
room
in
some
hotel
and
smoke
drink
and
swap
stories
until
enough
time
has
elapsed
for
a
proper
platform
to
be
written
they
then
report
to
the
committee
as
a
whole
and
after
some
wrangling
by
the
uninitiated
the
platform
is
passed
as
the
boss
has
written
it
without
the
addition
of
a
single
word
sometimes
it
is
necessary
to
place
upon
the
a
recalcitrant
or
two
then
the
method
is
somewhat
different
the
platform
is
cut
into
separate
planks
and
first
one
and
then
another
of
the
faithful
offers
a
plank
and
after
some
discussion
a
majority
of
the

selwyn
also
told
dru
that
it
was
often
the
practice
among
corporations
not
to
bother
themselves
about
state
politics
further
than
to
control
the
senate
this
smaller
body
was
seldom
more
than
as
large
as
the
house
and
usually
contained
not
more
than
or
thirty
members
their
method
was
to
control
a
majority
of
the
senate
and
let
the
house
pass
such
measures
as
it
pleased
and
the
governor
recommend
such
laws
as
he
thought
proper
then
the
senate
would
promptly
kill
all
legislation
that
in
any
way
touched
corporate
interests
still
another
method
which
was
used
to
advantage
by
the
interests
where
they
had
not
been
vigilant
in
the
protection
of
their
rights
and
when
they
had
no
sure
majority
either
in
the
house
or
senate
and
no
influence
with
the
governor
was
to
throw
what
strength
they
had
to
the
stronger
side
in
the
factional
fights
that
were
always
going
on
in
every
state
and
in
every
legislature
actual
money
selwyn
said
was
now
seldom
given
in
the
relentless
warfare
which
the
selfish
interests
were
ever
waging
against
the
people
but
it
was
intrigue
the
promise
of
place
and
power
and
the
ever
effectual
appeal
to
human
vanity
that
part
of
the
press
which
was
under
corporate
control
was
often
able
to
make
or
destroy
a
man
legislative
and
political
career
and
the
weak
and
the
vain
and
the
men
with
shifty
consciences
that
the
people
in
their
fatuous
indifference
elect
to
make
their

cause
of
the
high
cost
of
living
in

of

fireside
talks
selwyn
told
dru
that
a
potential
weapon
in
the
hands
of
those
who
had
selfish
purposes
to
subserve
was
the
long
and
confusing
ballot
whenever
a
change
is
suggested
by
which
it
can
be
shortened
and
the
candidates
brought
within
easy
review
of
the
electorate
the
objection
is
always
raised
said
selwyn
that
the
rights
of
the
people
are
being
invaded
the
people
rule
is
the
cry
he
said
and
the
unthinking
many
believing
that
democratic
government
is
being
threatened
demand
that
they
be
permitted
to
vote
for
every
petty
officer
of
course
quite
the
reverse
is
true
continued
selwyn
for
when
the
ballot
is
filled
with
names
of
candidates
running
for
general
and
local
offices
there
is
besides
the
confusion
the
usual
trading
as
a
rule
interest
centers
on
the
local
man
and
there
is
less
scrutiny
of
those
candidates
seeking
the
more
important
offices
while
i
had
already
made
up
my
mind
said
dru
as
to
the
short
ballot
and
a
direct
accountability
to
the
people
i
am
glad
to
have
you
confirm
the
correctness
of
my
views
you
may
take
my
word
for
it
general
dru
that
the
interests
also
desire
large
bodies
of
law
makers
instead
of
few
you
may
perhaps
recall
how
vigorously
they
opposed
the
commission
form
of
government
for
cities
under
the
old
system
when
there
was
a
large
council
no
one
was
responsible
if
a
citizen
had
a
grievance
and
complained
to
his
councilman
he
was
perhaps
truthfully
told
that
he
was
not
to
blame
he
was
sent
from
one
member
of
the
city
government
to
the
other
and
unable
to
obtain
relief
in
sheer
desperation
he
gave
up
hope
and
abandoned
his
effort
for
justice
but
under
the
commission
form
of
government
none
of
the
officials
can
shirk
responsibility
each
is
in
charge
of
a
department
and
if
there
is
inefficiency
it
is
easy
to
place
the
blame
where
it
properly
belongs
under
such
a
system
the
administration
of
public
affairs
becomes
at
once
simple
direct
and
if
any
outside
corrupt
influences
seek
to
creep
in
they
are
easy
of
detection
and
the
punishment
can
be
made
swift
and
certain
i
want
to
thank
you
again
senator
selwyn
for
the
help
you
have
been
to
me
in
giving
me
the
benefit
of
your
ripe
experience
in
public
affairs
said
dru
and
there
is
another
phase
of
the
subject
that
i
would
like
to
discuss
with
you
i
have
thought
long
and
seriously
how
to
overcome
the
fixing
of
prices
by
individuals
and
corporations
and
how
the
people
may
be
protected
from
that
form
of
robbery
when
there
is
a
monopoly
or
trust
it
is
easy
to
locate
the
offense
but
it
is
a
different
proposition
when
one
must
needs
deal
with
a
large
number
of
corporations
and
individuals
who
under
the
guise
of
competition
have
an
understanding
both
as
to
prices
and
territory
to
be
served
for
instance
the
coal
dealers
at
the
beginning
of
winter
announce
a
fixed
price
for
coal
if
there
are
fifty
of
them
and
all
are
approached
not
one
of
them
will
vary
his
quotation
from
the
other
if
he
should
do
so
the
coal
operators
would
be
informed
and
the
offending
dealer
would
find
by
some
pretext
or
another
his
supply
cut
off
we
see
the
same
condition
regarding
large
supply
and
manufacturing
concerns
which
cover
the
country
with
their
very
essential
products
a
keen
rivalry
is
apparent
and
competitive
bids
in
sealed
envelopes
are
made
when
requested
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
know
that
there
is
no
competition
can
you
give
me
any
information
upon
this
matter
there
are
many
and
devious
ways
by
which
the
law
can
be
evaded
and
by
which
the
despoliation
of
the
public
may
be
accomplished
said
selwyn
the
representatives
of
those
large
business
concerns
meet
and
a
map
of
the
united
states
is
spread
out
before
them
this
map
is
regarded
by
them
very
much
as
if
it
were
a
huge
pie
that
is
to
be
divided
according
to
the
capacity
of
each
to
absorb
and
digest
his
share
the
territory
is
not
squared
off
that
is
taking
in
whole
sections
of
contiguous
country
but
in
a
much
more
subtle
way
so
that
the
delusion
of
competition
may
be
undisturbed
when
several
of
these
concerns
are
requested
to
make
prices
they
readily
comply
and
seem
eager
for
the
order
the
delusion
extends
even
to
their
agents
who
are
as
innocent
as
the
purchaser
of
the
real
conditions
and
are
doing
their
utmost
to
obtain
the
business
the
concern
in
whose
assigned
territory
the
business
originates
makes
the
price
and
informs
its
supposed
rivals
of
its
bid
so
that
they
may
each
make
one
slightly
higher
which
goes
to
show
said
dru
how
easy
it
is
to
exploit
the
public
when
there
is
harmony
among
the
exploiters
there
seems
to
me
to
be
two
evils
involved
in
this
problem
senator
selwyn
one
is
the
undue
cost
to
the
people
and
the
other
but
lesser
evil
is
the
protection
of
incompetency
it
is
not
the
survival
of
the
fittest
but
an
excess
of
profits
that
enables
the
incompetent
to
live
and
thrive
after
a
long
and
exhaustive
study
of
this
problem
the
administrator
directed
his
legal
advisers
to
incorporate
his
views
into
law
no
individual
as
such
was
to
be
permitted
to
deal
in
what
might
be
termed
products
of
the
natural
resources
of
the
country
unless
he
subjected
himself
to
all
the
publicity
and
penalties
that
would
accrue
to
a
corporation
under
the
new
corporate
regulations
corporations
argued
dru
could
be
dealt
with
under
the
new
laws
in
a
way
that
while
fair
to
them
would
protect
the
public
in
the
future
he
reminded
his
commission
there
would
be
upon
the
directorates
a
representative
of
either
the
national
state
or
municipal
governments
and
the
books
and
every
transaction
would
be
open
to
the
public
this
would
apply
to
both
the
owner
of
the
raw
material
be
it
mine
forest
or
what
not
as
well
as
to
the
corporation
or
individual
who
distributed
the
marketable
product
it
was
dru
idea
that
public
opinion
was
to
be
invoked
to
aid
in
the
task
and
district
attorneys
and
grand
juries
throughout
the
country
were
to
be
admonished
to
do
their
duty
if
there
was
a
fixity
of
prices
in
any
commodity
or
product
or
even
approximately
so
he
declared
it
would
be
prima
facie
evidence
of
a
combination
in
this
way
the
administrator
thought
the
evil
of
pools
and
trust
agreements
could
be
eradicated
and
a
healthful
competition
content
with
reasonable
profits
established
if
a
single
corporation
by
its
extreme
efficiency
or
from
unusual
conditions
should
constitute
a
monopoly
so
that
there
was
practically
no
competition
then
it
would
be
necessary
he
thought
for
the
government
to
fix
a
price
reasonable
to
all
interests
involved
therefore
it
was
not
intended
to
put
a
limit
on
the
size
or
the
comprehensiveness
of
any
corporation
further
than
that
it
should
not
stifle
competition
except
by
greater
efficiency
in
production
and
distribution
if
this
should
happen
then
the
people
and
the
government
would
be
protected
by
publicity
by
their
representative
on
the
board
of
directors
and
by
the
fixing
of
prices
if
necessary
it
had
been
shown
by
the
career
of
one
of
the
greatest
industrial
combinations
that
the
world
has
yet
known
that
there
was
a
limit
where
size
and
inefficiency
met
the
only
way
that
this
corporation
could
maintain
its
lead
was
through
the
devious
paths
of
relentless
monopoly
dru

america
to
contend

and
to
enable

accomplish
this
he
favored
giving
business
the
widest
latitude
consistent
with
protection
of
the
people
when
he
assumed
control
of
the
government
one
of
the
many
absurdities
of
the
american
economic
system
was
the
practical
inhibition
of
a
merchant
marine
while
the
country
was
second
to
none
in
the
value
and
quantity
of
production
yet
its
laws
were
so
framed
that
it
was
dependent
upon
other
nations
for
its
transportation
by
sea
and
its
carrying
trade
was
in
no
way
commensurate

the

there

an
unusually
large
gathering

that

so
from
morbid

the
poignant

wrung
the

the
lowering
of

the

of
such
a
cruel

unnecessary
form
of

when
the
opportunity
presented
itself
he
directed
attention
to
the
objections
to
this
method
of
disposing
of
the
dead
and
he
suggested
the
formation
in
every
community
of
societies
whose
purpose
should
be
to
use
their
influence
towards
making
interments
private
and
towards
the
substitution
of
cremation
for
the
unsanitary
custom
of
burial
in
cemeteries
these
societies
were
urged
to
point
out
the
almost
prohibitive
expense
the
present
method
entailed
upon
the
poor
and
those
of
moderate
means
the
buying
of

the

amply
provide

to
permit

scale
not

different
from
what
they
had
been
accustomed
he
had
never
lived
in
the
extravagant
manner
that
was
usual
in
men
of
his
wealth
and
his
children
had
been
taught

he
was

wise
a

not
to
know
that
one
of
the
greatest
burdens
that
wealth
imposed
was
the
saving
of
one
children
from

contaminations
he
taught
his
sons
that
they
were
seriously
handicapped
by
their
expectations
of
even
moderate
wealth
and
that
unless
they
were
alert
and
vigilant
and
of
good
habits
the

who
was
working
his

would

he
would

selwyn
was

about
thirty
years
old

was
doing
valuable
laboratory
work
in
one
of
the
great

with
superb
health
and
a

he
seemed
to
have
it
in
him
to
go
far
in
his
profession
and
perhaps
be
of
untold
benefit
to
mankind
but
selwyn
had
noticed
an
indolent
streak
in
the
young
scientist
and
he
wondered
whether
here
again
he
was
doing
the
fair
and
right
thing
by
placing
it
within
his
power
to
lead
a
life
of
comparative
ease
and
uselessness
consequently
selwyn
moved
cautiously
in
the
matter
of
the
distribution
of
his
great
wealth
and
invoked

it
was
supernormal
intellect
tireless
energy
and
splendid

ability
that
appealed
to
him
and
he
not
only
admired
the

above
all

he
had
come
to
love
him
as
a

dru
was
the
only
person
with
whom
selwyn
had
ever
been
in
touch
whose
advice
he
valued
above
his
own
judgment
therefore
when
the
young

suggested
a
definite
plan

gave
it
respectful
attention
at

had
been
rehabilitating

he
never
for

that
he
was

he
had
begun

it

a
fire
behind

and
the
result
was
its
overthrow

as

to
listen
to
other
proposals
to

he
opened
up
a
wide
vista
of
commercial

territorial
expansion
or
at
least
its
equivalent
germany
was
to
have
the
freest
commercial
access
to
south
america
and
she
was
invited
to
develop
those
countries
both
with
german
colonists
and
german
capital
there
was
to
be
no
coercion
of
the
governments
or
political
control
in
that
territory
but
on
the
other
hand
the
united
states
undertook
that
there
should
be
no
laws
enacted
by
them
to
restrain
trade
and
that
the
rights
of
foreigners
should
have
the
fullest
protection
dru
also
undertook
the
responsibility
of
promising
that
there
should
be
no
favoritism
shown
by
the
south
and
central
american
governments
but
that
native
and
alien
should
stand
alike
before

so
far

was
to

it
was
not
intended
that

should
absorb
them

her
sphere
of
influence
was
to
be
extended
over
them
much
the

as
ours
was
over
south
america
while
england
was
not
to
be
restricted
in

trade
relations
with

was
neither

was
a
coalition
of
all
the
opposing
factions
and
the
massing
of
a
large
army
of
defense
the
central
american
republics
also
joined
mexico
and
hurriedly
sent
troops
north
general
dru
took
personal
command
of
the
american
forces
crossed
the
rio
grande
at
laredo
and
war
was
declared
there
were
a
large
number
of
mexican
soldiers
at
monterey
but
they
fell
back
in
order
to
get
in
touch
with
the
main
army
below
saltillo
general
dru
marched
steadily
on
but
before
he
came
to
saltillo
president
benevides
who
commanded
his
own
army
moved
southward
in
order
to
give
the
central
american
troops
time
to
reach
him
this
was
accomplished
about
fifty
miles
north
of
the
city
of
mexico
the
allies
had
one
hundred
thousand
men
and
the
american
force
numbered
sixty
thousand
dru
having
left
forty
thousand
at
laredo
monterey
and
saltillo
the
two
armies
confronted
one
another
for
five
days
general
benevides
waiting
for
the
americans
to
attack
while
general
dru
was
merely
resting
his
troops
and
preparing
them
for
battle
in
the
meantime
he
requested
a
conference
with
the
mexican
commander
and
the
two
met
with
their
staffs
midway
between
the
opposing
armies
general
dru
urged
an
immediate
surrender
and
fully
explained
his
plans
for
occupation
so
that
it
might
be
known
that
there
was
to
be
no
oppression
he
pointed
out
that
it
had
become
no
longer
possible
for
the
united
states
to
ignore
the
disorder
that
prevailed
in
mexico
and
those
countries
south
of
it
for
if
the
united
states
had
not
taken
action
europe
would
have
done
so
he
expressed
regret
that
a
country
so
favored
by
god
should
be
so
abused
by
man
for
with
peace
order
and
a
just
administration
of
the
government
mexico
and
her
sister
republics
he
felt
sure
would
take
a
high
place
in
the
esteem
of
the
world
he
also
said
that
he
had
carefully
investigated
conditions
knew
where
the
trouble
lay
and
felt
sure
that
the
mass
of
people
would
welcome
a
change
from
the
unbearable
existing
conditions
the
country
was
then
and
had
been
for
centuries
wrongfully
governed
by
a
bureaucracy
and
he
declared
his
belief
that
the
mexican
people
as
a
whole
believed
that
the
americans
would
give
them
a
greater
measure
of
freedom
and
protection
than
they
had
ever
known
before
dru
further
told
general
benevides
that
his
army
represented
about
all
there
was
of
opposition
to
america
offer
of
order
and
liberty
and
he
asked
him
to
accept
the
inevitable
and
not
sacrifice
the
lives
of
the
brave
men
in
both
commands
benevides
heard
him
with
cold
but
polite
silence
you
do
not
understand
us
senor
dru
nor
that
which
we
represent
we
would
rather
die
or
be
driven
into
exile
than
permit
you
to
arrange
our
internal
affairs
as
you
suggest
there
are
a
few
families
who
have
ruled
mexico
since
the
first
spanish
occupation
and
we
will
not
relinquish
our
hold
until
compelled
to
do
so
at
times
a
juarez
or
a
diaz
has
attained
to
the
presidency
but
we
the
great
families
have
been
the
power
behind
each
administration
the
peons
and
canaille
that
you
would
educate
and
make
our
political
equals
are
now
where
they
rightfully
belong
and
your
endeavors
in
their
behalf
are
misplaced
and
can
have
no
result
except
disaster
to
them
your
great
lincoln
emancipated
many
millions
of
blacks
and
they
were
afterwards
given
the
franchise
and
equal
rights
but
can
they
exercise
that
franchise
and
have
they
equal
rights
you
know
they
have
not
you
have
placed
them
in
a
worse
position
than
they
were
before
you
have
opened
a
door
of
hope
that
the
laws
of
nature
forbid
them
to
enter
so
it
would
be
here
your
theories
and
your
high
flown
sentiment
do
you
great
credit
but
illustrious
senor
read
the
pages
of
your
own
history
and
do
not
try
to
make
the
same
mistake
again
many
centuries
ago
the
all
knowing
christ
advised
the
plucking
of
the
mote
from
thine
own
eye
before
attempting
to
remove
it
from
that
of
thy
brother
to
this
dru
replied
your
criticism
of
us
is
only
partly
just
we
lifted
the
yoke
from
the
black
man
neck
but
we
went
too
fast
in
our
zeal
for
his
welfare
however
we
have
taken
him
out
of
a
boundless
swamp
where
under
the
old
conditions
he
must
have
wandered
for
all
time
without
hope
and
we
have
placed
his
feet
upon
firm
ground
and
are
leading
him
with
helping
hands
along
the
road
of
opportunity
that
though
president
is
only
a
part
of
our
mission
to
you
our
citizens
and
those
of
other
countries
have
placed
in
your
republic
vast
sums
for
its
development
trusting
to
your
treaty
guarantees
and
they
feel
much
concern
over
their
inability
to
operate
their
properties
not
only
to
the
advantage
of
your
people
but
to
those
to
whom
they
belong
we
of
western
europe
and
the
united
states
have
our
own
theories
as
to
the
functions
of
government
theories
that
perhaps
you
fail
to
appreciate
but
we
feel
we
must
not
only
observe
them
ourselves
but
try
and
persuade
others
to
do
likewise
one
of
these
ideas
is
the
maintenance
of
order
so
that
when
our
hospitable
neighbors
visit
us
they
may
feel
as
to
their
persons
and
property
as
safe
as
if
they
were
at
home
i
am
afraid
our
views
are
wide
apart
concluded
dru
and
i
say
it
with
deep
regret
for
i
wish
we
might
arrive
at
an
understanding
without
a
clash
at
arms
i
assure
you
that
my
visit
to
you
is
not
selfish
it
is
not
to
acquire
territory
or
for
the
aggrandizement
of
either
myself
or
my
country
but
it
is
to
do
the
work
that
we
feel
must
be
done
and
which
you
refuse
to
do
senor
dru
answered
benevides
it
has
been
a
pleasure
to
meet
you
and
discuss
the
ethics
of
government
but
even
were
i
willing
to
listen
to
your
proposals
my
army
and
adherents
would
not
so
there
is
nothing
we
can
do
except
to
finish
our
argument
upon
the
field
of
battle
the
interview
was
therefore
fruitless
but
dru
felt
that
he
had
done
his
duty
and
he
prepared
for
the

of

the
battle
of
la
tuna
was
not
important
but
its
effect
upon
mexico
and
the
central
american
republics
was
epoch
making
the
manner
of
attack
was
characteristic
of
dru
methods
his
interview
with
general
benevides
had
ended
at
noon
and
word
soon
ran
through
the
camp
that
peace
negotiations
had
failed
with
the
result
that
the
army
was
immediately
on
the
alert
and
eager
for
action
dru
did
not
attempt
to
stop
the
rumor
that
the
engagement
would
occur
at
dawn
the
next
day
by
dusk
every
man
was
in
readiness
but
they
did
not
have
to
wait
until
morning
for
as
soon
as
supper
was
eaten
to
the
surprise
of
everyone
word
came
to
make
ready
for
action
and
march
upon
the
enemy
of
sixty
thousand
men
twenty
thousand
were
cavalry
and
these
he
sent
to
attack
the
mexican
rear
they
were
ordered
to
move
quietly
so
as
to
get
as
near
to
the
enemy
as
possible
before
being
discovered
it
was
not
long
before
the
mexican
outposts
heard
the
marching
of
men
and
the
rumble
of
gun
carriages
this
was
reported
to
general
benevides
and
he
rode
rapidly
to
his
front
a
general
engagement
at
nightfall
was
so
unusual
that
he
could
not
believe
the
movement
meant
anything
more
than
general
dru
intention
to
draw
nearer
so
that
he
could
attack
in
the
morning
at
closer
range
it
was
a
clear
starlight
night
and
with
the
aid
of
his
glasses
he
could
see
the
dark
line
coming
steadily
on
he
was
almost
in
a
state
of
panic
when
he
realized
that
a
general
attack
was
intended
he
rode
back
through
his
lines
giving
orders
in
an
excited
and
irregular
way
there
was
hurry
and
confusion
everywhere
and
he
found
it
difficult
to
get
his
soldiers
to
understand
that
a
battle
was
imminent
those
in
front
were
looking
with
a
feeling
akin
to
awe
at
that
solid
dark
line
that
was
ever
coming
nearer
the
mexicans
soon
began
to
fire
from
behind
the
breastworks
that
had
been
hastily
erected
during
the
few
days
the
armies
had
been
facing
one
another
but
the
shots
went
wild
doing
but
slight
damage
in
the
american
ranks
then
came
the
order
from
dru
to
charge
and
with
it
came
the
yankee
yell
it
was
indeed
no
battle
at
all
by
the
time
the
americans
reached
the
earthworks
the
mexicans
were
in
flight
and
when
the
cavalry
began
charging
the
rear
the
rout
was
completed
in
the
battle
of
la
tuna
general
benevides
proved
himself
worthy
of
his
lineage
no
general
could
have
done
more
to
rally
his
troops
or
have
been
more
indifferent
to
danger
he
scorned
to
turn
his
back
upon
an
enemy
and
while
trying
to
rally
his
scattered
forces
he
was
captured
badly
wounded
every
attention
worthy
his
position
was
shown
the
wounded
man
proud
and
chivalrous
as
any
of
his
race
he
was
deeply
humiliated
at
the
miserable
failure
that
had
been
made
to
repell
the
invaders
of
his
country
though
keenly
touched
by
the
consideration
and
courtesy
shown
him
by
the
american
general
dru
made
no
spectacular
entrance
into
the
city
but
remained
outside
and
sent
one
of
his
staff
with
a
sufficient
force
to
maintain
order
in
an
address
announcing
his
intentions
towards
mexico

they
camped
upon
a
mighty
cliff
towering
high
above
the
potomac
what
pleasure
they
had
preparing
their
simple
meal
it
was
hard
for
gloria
to
realize
that
this
lighthearted
boy
was
the
serious
statesman
and
soldier
of
yesterday
when
they
had
finished
they
sat
in
the
warm
sunshine
on
the
cliff
edge
the
gleaming
river

its
devious
course
far
below

parting

the
evening
of
the
year
had
come
and
forest
and

had
been
touched
by
the
master
hand
for
a
long
time
they
sat
silent
under
the
spell
that
nature
had
thrown
around
them
i
find
it
essential
for
the
country
good
to
leave
it
for
awhile
perhaps
forever
said
philip
dru
already
a
large
majority
of
the
newly
elected
house
have
asked
me
to
become
the
executive
if
i
accepted
there
would
be
those
who
would
believe
that
in
a
little
while
i
would
again
assume
autocratic
control
i
would
be
a
constant
menace
to
my
country
if
i
remained
within
it
i
have
given
to
the
people
the
best
service
of
which
i
was
capable
and
they
know
and
appreciate
it
now
i
can
serve
them
again
by
freeing
them
from
the
shadow
of
my
presence
and
my
name
i
shall
go
to
some
obscure
portion
of
the
world
where
i
can
not
be
found
and
importuned
to
return
there
is
at
san
francisco
a
queenly
sailing
craft
manned
and
provisioned
for
a
long
voyage
she
is
waiting
to
carry
me
to
the
end
if
needs
be
then
philip
took
gloria
unresisting
hand
and
said
my
beloved
will
you
come
with
me
in
my
exile
i
have
loved
you
since
the
day
that
you
came
into
my
life
and
you
can
never
know
how
i
have
longed
for
the
hour
to
come
when
i
would
be
able
to
tell
you
so
come
with
me
dear
heart
into
this
unknown
land
and
make
it
glad
for
me
come
because
i
am
drunken
with
love
of
you
and
can
not
go
alone
come
so
that
the
days
may
be
flooded
with
joy
and
at
night
the
stars
may
sing
to
me
because
you
are
there

come

happy
gloria
happy
philip
she
did
not
answer
him
what
need
was
there
how
long
they
sat
neither
knew
but
the
sun
was
far
in
the
west
and
was
sending
its
crimson
tide
over
an
enchanted
land
when
the
lovers
came
back
to
earth
far
out
upon
the
waters
of
san
francisco
bay
lay
the
graceful
yet
sturdy
the
wind
had
freshened
the
sails
were
filled
and
she
was
going
swift
as
a
gull
through
the
golden
gate
into
a
shimmering
sea
a
multitude
of
friends
and
those
that
wished
them
well
had
gathered
on
the
water
front
and
upon
the
surrounding
hills
to
bid
farewell
to
philip
dru
and
his
bride
gloria
they
watched
in
silent
sadness
as
long
as
they
could
see
the
silhouette
against
the
western
sky
and
until
it
faded
into
the
splendid
waste
of
the
pacific
where
were
they
bound
would
they
return
these
were
the
questions
asked
by
all
but
to
which
none
could
give
answer
the
end
what
can
do
by
earl
grey
of
canada
of
the
ablest
champions
of
as
a
solution
of
the
industrial
problem
is
earl
are
some
remarkable
passages
from
his
presidential
address
to
the
labor
the
problem
before
us
is
how
to
organize
our
industry
on
lines
the
fairness
of
which
will
be
generally
admitted
fairplay
is
the
keynote
of
our
british
character
and
i
am
satisfied
if
employers
and
employed
are
properly
approached
that
wherever
a
feeling
of
mutual
sympathetic
regard
exists
between
them
they
will
both
be
prepared
to
consider
fairly
and
to
meet
fully
each
other
requirements
this
is
the
belief
on
which
we
build
our
hopes
of
the
future
greatness
of
this
country
remove
this
belief
and
the
outlook
is
one
of
blackest
gloom
now
what
is
the
cause
of
the
wide
feeling
of
labor
unrest
at
the
same
time
while
the
average
standard
of
living
as
a
result
of
better
education
has
been
considerably
raised
and
the
retail
prices
of
food
have
risen
per
cent
since
wages
in
that
period
have
only
risen
per
cent
consequently
the
manual
workers
find
themselves
in
straitened
pinched
and
most
distressing
circumstances
their
difficulties
have
naturally
given
birth
to
a
general
belief
or
at
any
rate
added
strength
to
it
that
they
are
not
receiving
their
fair
share
of
the
wealth
their
labor
has
helped
so
largely
to
create
now
whether
this
belief
is
justified
or
not
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
its
existence
labor
and
capital
in
opposing
camps
the
great
fact
with
which
we
are
confronted
in
the
industries
of
is
that
labor
and
capital
are
organized
not
in
one
but
in
opposing
camps
with
the
object
not
so
much
of
promoting
the
common
of
all
connected
with
industry
as
of
securing
whatever
advantage
can
be
obtained
in
the
prosecution
of
their
common
industry
for
themselves
the
members
of
each
camp
consequently
regard
each
other
with
distrust
and
suspicion
the
capitalist
is
inclined
to
give
the
minimum
that
is
necessary
to
secure
the
labor
which
he
requires
and
the
worker
in
return
considers
that
all
that
should
be
required
from
him
is
the
minimum
of
labor
which
will
save
him
from
dismissal
then
not
only
have
we
to
consider
the
limiting
effect
on
the
efficiency
of
industry
caused
by
the
fact
that
capital
and
labor
are
ranged
not
in
one
but
in
opposing
camps
but
we
have
also
to
consider
the
effect
on
the
attitude
of
the
men
towards
the
management
caused
by
the
growing
tendency
of
the
small
business
to
be
swallowed
up
by
the
large
combine
in
such
cases
the
old
feeling
of
mutual
affection
confidence
and
esteem
which
in
the
past
bound
together
employer
and
employed
has
been
destroyed
and
it
must
be
obvious
that
unless
we
can
adopt
methods
which
will
restore
in
a
new
and
perhaps
in
a
more
satisfactory
manner
the
old
spirit
the
efficiency
of
industry
and
the
prosperity
of
the
nation
will
both
suffer
if
you
alter
one
part
of
any
bit
of
machinery
you
must
readjust
all
the
other
parts
in
order
to
secure
smooth
working
and
if
by
substituting
big
businesses
for
small
businesses
you
destroy
the
old
intimate
connection
which
formerly
existed
between
masters
and
men
it
would
appear
to
be
necessary
if
you
wish
to
maintain
the
old
friendly
relations
between
employer
and
employed
that
you
should
establish
your
business
on
lines
which
will
automatically
create
a
feeling
of
loyalty
on
the
part
of
all
concerned
to
the
industry
with
which
they
are
connected
how
is
that
to
be
done
by
now
what
is
the
ideal
of
ideal
is
a
system
under
which
worker
and
consumer
shall
share
with
capitalists
in
the
profits
of
industry
the
surplus
profits
go
to
capital
under
our
present
system
the
whole
of
the
surplus
profits
go
to
capital
and
it
is
the
object
of
capital
to
give
the
worker
the
least
wage
for
which
he
will
consent
to
work
and
to
charge
the
consumer
the
highest
price
which
he
can
be
persuaded
to
give
conversely
it
is
the
object
of
labor
to
give
as
little
as
possible
for
the
wage
received
now
that
is
a
system
which
can
not
possibly
satisfy
the
requirements
of
a
civilized
and
society
what
we
want
is
a
system
which
will
safeguard
the
consumer
and
also
provide
the
worker
with
a
natural
inducement
to
help
the
industry
with
which
he
is
connected
that
system
is
provided
by
insists
that
the
workers
have
a
right
to
participate
in
the
net
profits
that
may
remain
after
capital
has
received
its
fixed
reward
in
a
business
just
as
the
reward
of
labor
is
fixed
by
the
trade
union
rate
of
wages
so
the
reward
of
capital
is
fixed
by
the
amount
which
it
is
necessary
for
the
industry
to
give
that
amount
will
vary
corresponding
with
the
security
of
the
risk
attending
the
industry
in
question
if
the
industry
is
a
safe
one
it
will
be
able
to
obtain
the
capital
required
by
giving
a
small
interest
if
the
industry
is
a
risky
one
it
will
be
necessary
to
offer
capital
better
terms
then
if
there
should
be
surplus
profits
available
for
division
after
labor
has
received
its
fixed
reward
trade
union
rate
of
wages
and
after
capital
has
received
its
fixed
reward
the
rate
of
interest
agreed
upon
as
the
fair
remuneration
of
capital
i
say
if
after
these
two
initial
charges
have
been
met
there
should
still
be
left
surplus
profits
to
distribute
that
instead
of
their
going
exclusively
to
capital
they
should
be
distributed
between
labor
and
capital
on
some
principle
of
equity
the
way
in
which
the
principle
of
can
be
supplied
to
industrial
enterprise
admits
of
infinite
variety
in
some
cases
the
surplus
profits
are
divided
between
wages
interest
and
custom
in
some
cases
between
wages
and
custom
without
any
share
going
to
interest
and
on
some
cases
between
wages
and
interest
as
an
example
of
a
industry
which
divides
all
surplus
profits
that
may
remain
after
per
cent
has
been
paid
on
capital
between
custom
and
labor
one
pound
of
purchase
counting
for
as
much
in
the
division
as
one
pound
of
wage
let
me
refer
to
the
hebden
bridge
fustian
works
i
commend
to
all
interested
in
questions
a
close
study
of
this
industry
started
by
working
men
in
it
has
built
up
on
lines
of
permanent
success
a
flourishing
business
and
is
making
sufficient
profits
to
enable
it
to
divide
in
the
pound
on
trade
union
rate
of
wages
and
the
same
amount
on
purchases
the
steady
progress
of
this
manufacturing
industry
over
a
period
of
years
the
recognition
by
trade
unionist
management
of
the
right
of
capital
to
receive
an
annual
dividend
of
per
and
the
resolute
way
in
which
they
have
written
down
the
capital
of
invested
in
land
buildings
and
machinery
to
notwithstanding
that
a
less
conservative
policy
would
have
increased
the
sum
available
for
bonus
to
wages
all
go
to
show
how
practicable
are
principles
when
they
are
applied
by
all
concerned
to
productive
enterprise
in
the
right
spirit
a
brilliant
example
i
should
also
like
to
refer
to
thompson
woolen
mills
of
huddersfield
established
in
as
another
brilliant
example
of
successful
it
is
frequently
stated
that
in
an
industry
where
men
are
paid
by
piecework
or
share
in
the
profits
there
is
a
tendency
for
the
men
to
themselves
well
in
the
thompson
huddersfield
mills
there
is
no
piecework
no
overtime
only
the
weekly
wage
no
driving
is
allowed
the
hours
of
labor
are
limited
to
per
week
the
workers
are
given
a
whole
week
holiday
in
august
and
in
addition
they
enjoy
the
benefits
of
a
sick
and
accident
fund
and
of
a
per
week
pension
fund
in
these
mills
cloth
is
made
from
wool
and
wool
only
not
an
ounce
of
shoddy
here
again
the
surplus
profits
after
the
fixed
reward
of
capital
interest
at
the
rate
of
per
cent
per
annum
has
been
paid
are
divided
between
labor
and
custom
and
here
again
the
capital
sunk
in
the
mills
has
been
written
down
from
to
unprofitable
machinery
is
the
mill
has
only
the
best
most
machinery
and
all
connected
with
the
works
shareholders
and
workers
live
together
like
a
happy
family
as
an
illustration
of
a
industry
which
divides
its
surplus
profits
between
wages
interest
and
custom
i
might
point
to
the
gas
companies
which
are
being
administered
on
the
livesey
principle
which
is
now
so
well
known
since
principles
were
applied
to
the
south
metropolitan
gas
works
in
over
has
been
paid
as
their
share
of
the
profits
to
the
credit
of
the
workers
who
also
own
over
of
the
company
stock
the
fact
that
over
of
capital
is
invested
in
gas
companies
administered
on
principles
which
divide
surplus
profits
between
consumers
shareholders
and
encourages
us
to
hope
that
we
may
look
forward
with
confidence
to
the
adoption
of
principles
by
other
industries
as
an
illustration
of
a
industry
which
divides
its
surplus
profits
between
labor
and
capital
alone
let
me
refer
to
the
walsall
padlock
society
one
of
the
workmen
productive
societies
which
may
be
regarded
as
so
many
different
schools
of
under
exclusive
trade
unionist
management
in
this
society
the
rate
of
interest
on
share
capital
has
been
fixed
at
per
and
should
there
be
any
surplus
profit
after
trade
union
rate
of
wages
and
the
fixed
reward
of
capital
per
have
been
paid
it
is
divided
between
labor
and
capital
in
proportion
to
the
value
of
their
respective
services
and
the
measure
of
the
value
is
the
price
the
walsall
padlock
society
pays
for
the
use
of
capital
and
labor
respectively
of
interest
counts
for
as
much
in
the
division
of
the
profits
as
of
wage
and
vice
versa
this
principle
of
division
invented
by
the
frenchman
godin
of
guise
has
always
seemed
to
me
to
be
absolutely
fair
and
to
be
capable
of
being
easily
applied
to
many
industries
now
in
these
cases
i
have
quoted
and
i
could
refer
to
many
others
a
unity
of
interest
is
established
between
labor
and
capital
with
the
result
that
there
is
a
general
atmosphere
of
peace
and
of
mutual
brotherhood
and
goodwill
capital
receives
the
advantage
of
greater
security
labor
is
secured
the
highest
rate
of
wage
the
industry
can
afford
willing
and
unwilling
service
now
what
does
the
substitution
of
such
conditions
for
the
conditions
generally
prevailing
in
england
mean
for
our
country
who
shall
estimate
the
difference
between
the
value
of
willing
and
unwilling
service
the
board
of
trade
will
tell
you
that
a
man
paid
by
piecework
is
generally
from
to
per
cent
more
effective
than
a
man
paid
by
time
if
the
principle
which
is
better
than
piecework
because
it
tends
to
produce
identity
of
interest
between
capital
and
labor
were
to
increase
the
efficiency
of
workers
from
to
per
just
think
of
the
result
and
yet
the
fact
that
might
add
from
to
per
cent
to
the
efficiency
of
the
worker
is
urged
by
many
trade
unionists
as
a
reason
against
they
seem
to
fear
that
the
result
of
making
men
will
be
to
cause
them
to
give
per
cent
better
labor
and
to
receive
only
per
cent
more
wage
no
system
can
be
right
which
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
calls
for
a
man
to
give
his
worst
instead
of
his
best
when
i
compare
canada
with
england
i
am
struck
by
the
fact
that
whereas
greatest
undeveloped
asset
is
her
natural
resources
england
greatest
undeveloped
asset
is
man
himself
how
to
get
each
man
to
do
his
best
is
the
problem
before
england
it
is
because
harnesses
to
industry
not
only
the
muscle
but
the
heart
and
the
intelligence
of
the
worker
that
we
are
justified
in
regarding
it
with
reverence
and
enthusiasm
as
the
principle
of
the
future
