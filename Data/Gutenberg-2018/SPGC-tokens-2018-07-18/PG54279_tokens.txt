preface
the
second
volume
of
this
work
has
swelled
to
an
even
greater
bulk
than
its
predecessor
its
size
must
be
attributed
to
two
main
causes
the
first
is
the
fact
that
a
much
greater
number
of
original
sources
both
printed
and
unprinted
are
available
for
the
campaigns
of
than
for
those
of
the
second
is
that
the
war
in
its
second
year
had
lost
the
character
of
comparative
unity
which
it
had
possessed
in
its
first
napoleon
on
quitting
spain
in
january
left
behind
him
as
a
legacy
to
his
brother
a
comprehensive
plan
for
the
conquest
of
the
whole
peninsula
but
that
plan
was
from
the
first
impracticable
and
when
it
had
miscarried
the
fighting
in
every
region
of
the
theatre
of
war
became
local
and
isolated
neither
the
harassed
and
distracted
french
king
at
madrid
nor
the
impotent
spanish
junta
at
seville
knew
how
to
combine
and
the
operations
of
their
various
armies
into
a
single
logical
scheme
ere
long
six
or
seven
campaigns
were
taking
place
simultaneously
in
different
corners
of
the
peninsula
each
of
which
was
practically
independent
of
the
others
every
french
and
spanish
general
fought
for
his
own
hand
with
little
care
for
what
his
colleagues
were
doing
their
only
unanimity
was
that
all
alike
kept
urging
on
their
central
governments
the
plea
that
their
own
particular
section
of
the
war
was
more
critical
and
important
than
any
other
if
we
look
at
the
month
of
may
we
find
that
the
following
six
disconnected
series
of
operations
were
all
in
progress
at
once
and
that
each
has
to
be
treated
as
a
separate
unit
rather
than
as
a
part
of
one
great
general
scheme
of
strategy
soult
s
campaign
against
wellesley
in
northern
portugal
ney
s
invasion
of
the
asturias
victor
s
and
cuesta
s

sebastiani
s

suchet
s

cyr
s
attempt
to
subdue
catalonia
when
a
war
has
broken
up
into
so
many
fractions
it
becomes
not
only
hard
to
follow
but
very
lengthy
to
narrate
fortunately
for
the
historian
and
the
student
a
certain
amount
of
unity
is
restored
in
july
mainly
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
of
wellesley
has
been
brought
to
bear
upon
the
situation
when
the
british
general
attempted
to
combine
with
the
spanish
armies
of
estremadura
and
la
mancha
for
a
common
march
upon
madrid
the
whole
of
the
hostile
forces
in
the
peninsula
with
the
exception
of
those
in
aragon
and
catalonia
were
once
more
drawn
into
a
single
scheme
of
operations
hence
the
talavera
campaign
is
the
central
fact
in
the
annals
of
the
peninsular
war
for
the
year
i
trust
that
it
will
not
be
considered
that
i
have
devoted
a
disproportionate
amount
of
space
to
the
setting
forth
and
discussion
of
the
various
problems
which
it
involved
the
details
of
the
battle
of
talavera
itself
have
engaged
my
special
attention
i
thought
it
worth
while
to
go
very
carefully
over
the
which
fortunately
remains
much
as
it
was
in
a
walk
around
it
explained
many
difficulties
but
suggested
certain
others
which
i
have
done
my
best
to
solve
in
several
other
chapters
of
this
volume
i
discovered
that
a
personal
inspection
of
localities
produced
most
valuable
results
at
oporto
for
example
i
found
wellesley
s
passage
of
the
douro
assuming
a
new
aspect
when
studied
on
the
spot
not
one
of
the
historians
who
have
dealt
with
it
has
taken
the
trouble
to
mention
that
the
crossing
was
effected
at
a
point
where
the
douro
runs
between
lofty
and
precipitous
cliffs
towering
nearly
feet
above
the
water
s
edge
yet
this
simple
fact
explains
how
it
came
to
pass
that
the
passage
was
effected
at
all
the
french
on
the
plateau
above
the
river
could
not
see
what
was
going
on
at
the
bottom
of
the
deeply
sunk
gorge
which
lies
in
a
dead
angle
to
any
observer
who
has
not
come
forward
to
the
very
edge
of
the
cliff
i
have
inserted
a
photograph
of
the
spot
which
will
explain
the
situation
at
a
glance
from
napier
s
narrative
and
plan
i
am
driven
to
conclude
that
he
had
either
never
seen
the
ground
or
had
forgotten
its
aspect
after
the
lapse
of
years
a
search
in
the
madrid
de
la
produced
a
few
important
documents
for
the
talavera
campaign
and
was
made
most
pleasant
by
the
extreme
courtesy
of
the
officers
in
charge
it
is
curious
to
find
that
our
london
record
office
contains
a
good
many
spanish
dispatches
which
do
not
survive
at
madrid
this
results
from
the
laudable
zeal
with
which
frere
when
acting
as
british
minister
at
seville
sent
home
copies
of
every
spanish
document
printed
or
unprinted
on
which
he
could
lay
his
hands
once
or
twice
he
thus
preserved
invaluable
morning
states
of
the
peninsular
armies
which
it
would
otherwise
have
been
impossible
to
recover
among
our
other
representatives
in
spain
captain
carroll
was
the
only
one
who
possessed
to
a
similar
degree
this
admirable
habit
of
collecting
original
documents
and
statistics
his
copious
enclosures
to
lord
castlereagh
are
of
the
greatest
use
for
the
comprehension
of
the
war
in
the
asturias
and
galicia
neither
napier
nor
any
other
historian
of
the
peninsular
war
has
gone
into
the
question
of
beresford
s
reorganization
of
the
portuguese
army
comparing
english
and
portuguese
documents
i
have
succeeded
in
working
it
out
and
trust
that
chapter
iii
of
section
xiii
and
appendix
no
v
may
suffice
to
demonstrate
beresford
s
very
real
services
to
the
allied
cause
it
is
my
pleasant
duty
to
acknowledge
much
kind
help
that
i
have
received
from
correspondents
on
both
sides
of
the
sea
who
have
come
to
my
aid
in
determining
points
of
difficulty
of
those
in
england
i
must
make
particular
notice
of
colonel
whinyates
a
specialist
in
all
matters
connected
with
the
british
artillery
i
owe
to
him
my
appendix
no
xi
which
he
was
good
enough
to
draw
up
as
well
as
the
loan
of
several
unpublished
diaries
of
officers
of
his
own
arm
from
which
i
have
extracted
some
useful
and
interesting
facts
i
must
also
express
my
obligation
to
mayne
for
information
relating
to
sir
robert
wilson
s
loyal
lusitanian
legion
of
which
his
relative
colonel
mayne
was
in
the
the
excerpts
which
he
was
kind
enough
to
collect
for
me
have
proved
of
great
service
and
could
not
have
been
procured
from
any
other
quarter
nor
must
i
omit
to
thank
two
other
correspondents
colonel
willoughby
verner
and
the
rev
alexander
craufurd
for
their
notes
concerning
the
celebrated
light
division
in
which
the
one
is
interested
as
the
historian
of
the
old
and
the
other
as
the
grandson
of
robert
craufurd
of
famous
memory
of
helpers
from
beyond
the
channel
i
must
make
special
mention
of
commandant
balagny
the
author
of
en
who
has
supplied
me
with
a
great
number
of
official
documents
from
paris
and
in
especial
with
a
quantity
of
statistics
many
of
them
hitherto
unpublished
which
serve
to
fix
the
strength
and
the
losses
of
various
french
corps
in
i
also
owe
to
him
my
appendix
vi
iii
a
most
interesting
of
the
material
in
the
french
archives
relating
to
the
strange
oporto
conspiracy
of
captain
argenton
and
his
confederates
this
obscure
chapter
of
the
history
of
the
peninsular
war
is
i
think
brought
out
in
its
true
proportions
by
the
juxtaposition
of
the
english
and
french
documents
it
is
clear
that
soult
s
conduct
was
far
more
sinister
than
napier
will
allow
and
also
that
the
plot
to
depose
the
marshal
was
the
work
of
a
handful
of
military
intriguers
not
of
the
great
body
of
conspirators
in
whose
existence
the
mendacious
argenton
has
induced
some
historians
to
believe
at
madrid
general
arteche
placed
at
my
disposal
with
the
most
bountiful
liberality
his
immense
stores
of
knowledge
which
i
had
learnt
to
appreciate
long
before
as
a
conscientious
student
of
his
de
la
he
pointed
out
to
me
many
new
sources
which
had
escaped
my
notice
and
was
good
enough
to
throw
light
on
many
problems
which
had
been
vexing
me
for
his
genial
kindness
i
can
not
too
strongly
express
my
obligation
of
the
officers
at
the
madrid
de
la
whose
courtesy
i
have
mentioned
above
i
must
give
special
thanks
to
captain
emilio
figueras
from
whom
just
as
these
pages
are
going
to
press
i
have
received
some
additional
figures
relating
to
the
army
of
estremadura
in
finally
as
in
my
first
volume
i
must
make
special
acknowledgement
of
the
assistance
of
two
helpers
in
oxford
the
indefatigable
compiler
of
the

doble

the

were
inadequate
in
numbers
for

were

attitude
the
only
regions
in

the

continued
to
pursue

active
policy
were
aragon
and
catalonia
from

on
account
of
their
remoteness
the
emperor
had
not
withdrawn
any
troops
for
his
great
encircling

john

in
both
those
provinces
important
operations
began
on
the
very
day
on
which
bonaparte
set
out
to
hunt
the
english
army
it
was
on
december
that
lannes
commenced
the
second
siege
of
saragossa
and
that
cyr
after
relieving
barcelona
scattered
the
army
of
catalonia
at
the
battle
of

de

but
the
campaigns
of
aragon
and
catalonia
were
both
of
secondary
importance
when
compared
with
the
operations
in
central
spain
as
the
whole

of

to

the

in

hills
never
exercised
much
influence
on
the
affairs
of
castile
and
portugal
it
is
not
therefore
too
much
to
assert
that
it
was
moore
s
march
on
sahagun
and
that
march
alone
which
paralysed
the
main
scheme
of
the
emperor
for
the
conquest
of
spain

december
and
january
the
central
reserves
of
the
french
army
had
been
hurried

plains
of
northern
leon
it
was
not
till
the
new
year
had
come
that
the
emperor
began
to
think
of
sending
some
of
them

to

such
a
reinforcement
was
far
from
being
enough
to
enable
joseph
bonaparte
and
his
military
adviser
jourdan
to
assume
the
offensive
towards
the
valleys
of
the
tagus
and
guadiana
the
consequences
of
moore
s
diversion
were
not

but
prolonged
it
was
not
till
the
middle
of
march
that
the
army
of
the
king
was
able
to
resume
the
attempt
to
march
on
seville
and
by
that
time
the
condition
of
affairs
had
been
profoundly
modified
to
the
advantage
of
the
spaniards
the
intervening
time
was
not
one
of
rest
for
joseph
and
his
army
their
movements
require
careful
attention
when
napoleon
hurried
the
main
body
of
his
troops
across
the
somosierra

seeming
too
small
the

was
ordered
in
to
reinforce
them
the
rest
of
the
army
lay
in
two
concentric
semicircles
outside

the
inner
semicircle
was
formed
of
infantry
there
was
a

as
a
sort
of
advanced
guard
in
the
direction
of
estremadura
lasalle
s
light
cavalry
had
pushed
on
to
the
great
bridge
of
almaraz
behind
which
the
wrecks
of
the
mutinous
armies
of
belvedere
and
san
juan
were
beginning
to
collect
under
their
new
commander
galluzzo
the
a
stray
remnant
left
behind
by
dessolles
division
of
villatte
it
had
one
battalion
detached
along
with
the
chasseurs
at
toledo
division

and
sebastiani
lasalle
s
division
often
altered
in
composition
now
consisted
of
the
and
chasseurs
dragoons
and
polish
lancers
the
emperor
s
parting
orders
to
jourdan
had
been
to
send
forward
lasalle
and
lefebvre
to
deal
a
blow
at
the
estremaduran
army
they
had
he
wrote
twice
the
numbers
necessary
to
break
up
the
small
force
of
disorganized
troops
in
front
of
them
on
december
lefebvre
was
to
cross
the
tagus
scatter
galluzzo
s
men
to
the
winds
and
then
come
back
to
talavera
after
building
a
at
almaraz
lasalle
s
cavalry
would
be
capable
of
looking
after
what
was
left
of
this
force
for
it
would
not
give
trouble
again
for
many
a
week
to
come
victor
on
the
side
of
la
mancha
must
keep
watch
on
any
movements
of
the
spaniards
from
the
direction
of
cuenca
or
the
sierra
morena
he
would
have
no
difficulty
in
holding
them
off
for
all
the
débris
of
the
insurgent
armies
combined
could
not
face
even
the
french
cavalry
left
in
front
of
them
to
say
nothing
of
the
infantry
behind
see
for
all
these
details
the
first
portion
of
the
orders
of
the
emperor
was
duly
carried
out
on
december
the
duke
of
dantzig
advanced
from
talavera
upon
the
bridges
of
arzobispo
and
almaraz
behind
which
lay
or
of
galluzzo
s
dispirited
levies
he
made
no
more
than
a
feint
at
the
passage
but
attacking
the
more
important
bridge
of
almaraz
carried
it
at
the
first
rush
and
took
the
four
guns
which
galluzzo
had
mounted
on
the
southern
bank
to
command
the
defile
the
spaniards
scattered
in
all
directions
abandoned
the
banks
of
the
tagus
and
placed
themselves
in
safety
behind
the
rugged
sierra
de
guadalupe
so
far
the
emperor
s
design
was
carried
out
but
lefebvre
then
took
a
most
extraordinary
step
instead
of
returning
as
he
had
been
ordered
to
talavera
and
remaining
in
that
central
position
till
further
orders
should
be
sent
him
he
went
off
on
an
inexplicable
adventure
of
his
own
leaving
only
lasalle
s
cavalry
and
two
polish
battalions
on
the
tagus
he
turned
north
as
if
intending
to
join
the
emperor
crossed
the
mountains
between
new
and
old
castile
and
on
january
appeared
at
avila
in
the
latter
province
not
only
was
the
march
in
complete
contravention
of
the
emperor
s
orders
but
it
was
carried
out
in
disobedience
to
five
separate
dispatches
sent
from
madrid
by
jourdan
in
the
name
of
king
joseph
lefebvre
paid
no
attention
whatever
to
the
lieutenant
of
the
emperor
in
spite
of
vehement
representations
to
the
effect
that
he
was
exposing
madrid
by
this
eccentric
movement
it
was
indeed
an
unhappy
inspiration
that
led
him
to
avila
for
at
this
precise
moment
the
spaniards
were
commencing
a
wholly
unexpected
offensive
advance
against
the
spanish
capital
which
lefebvre
if
he
had
remained
at
talavera
might
have
aided
in
repelling
much
incensed
at
his
disobedience
napoleon
deprived
him
of
the
command
of
the
corps
and
sent
him
back
to
france
this
marshal
he
wrote
to
king
joseph
does
nothing
but
make
blunders
he
can
not
seize
the
meaning
of
the
orders
sent
him
it
is
impossible
to
leave
him
in
command
of
a
corps
which
is
a
pity
for
he
is
a
brave
enough
fellow
on
the
sebastiani
lefebvre
s
senior
divisional
general
replaced
him
in
command
of
his
corps
napier
misrepresents
this
move
in
the
strangest
way
saying
i
merely
that
the
duke
of
dantzig
recrossed
the
tagus
and
took
post
between
talavera
and
avila
is
fifty
miles
north
of
these
places
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
guadarrama
napoleon
to
joseph
from
valladolid
the
new
spanish
advance
upon
madrid
requires
a
word
of
explanation
we
have
seen
that
the
weary
and
dilapidated
army
of
the
centre
now
commanded
by
the
duke
of
infantado
had
reached
cuenca
on
december
after
escaping
from
the
various
snares
which
napoleon
had
set
for
it
during
its
march
from
calatayud
to
the
valley
of
the
upper
tagus
when
he
had
escaped
from
bessières
pursuit
the
duke
proceeded
to
give
his
army
a
fortnight
s
rest
in
the
mountain
villages
round
cuenca
he
sent
back
to
valencia
the
wrecks
of
roca
s
division
which
had
originally
been
raised
in
that
kingdom
it
had
dwindled
down
to
men
from
its
original
the
other
troops
the
and
divisions
of
the
old
army
of
andalusia
had
not
suffered
quite
so
much
as
they
had
not
been
seriously
engaged
at
tudela
but
they
were
and
very
disorderly
infantado
was
forced
to
shoot
an
officer
and
two
sergeants
for
open
mutiny
before
he
could
restore
the
elements
of
discipline
see
the
figures
furnished
by
the
valencian
junta
in
argüelles
ii
it
must
he
remembered
that
of
the
division
had
escaped
to
saragossa
and
took
part
in
its
defence
the
division
had
only
four
battalions
present
the
others
having
been
at
madrid
in
the
army
of
san
juan
the
officer
a
lieutenant
santiago
had
refused
to
march
on
cuenca
and
when
the
order
was
repeated
unlimbered
his
battery
across
the
road
and
threatened
to
fire
on
the
troops
who
were
marching
in
that
direction
see
arteche
iii
the
province
of
cuenca
is
the
most
thinly
peopled
and
desolate
of
all
the
regions
of
spain
and
though
some
stores
and
food
were
procured
from
valencia
it
was
impossible
to
the
army
in
a
satisfactory
way
winter
clothing
in
particular
was
absolutely
unprocurable
and
if
the
men
had
not
been
placed
under
roofs
in
cuenca
and
the
villages
around
they
must
have
perished
of
cold
but
a
fortnight
s
rest
did
much
for
them
many
stragglers
came
up
from
the
rear
a
few
reinforcements
were
received
and
to
the
surprise
of
the
whole
army
the
brigade
of
the
conde
de
alacha
which
had
been
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
troops
on
the
day
of
tudela
turned
up
intact
to
join
its
division
this
detachment
it
will
be
remembered
had
been
left
in
the
mountains
near
agreda
to
observe
the
advance
of
marshal
ney
after
the
rout
it
had
nearly
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
corps
and
had
been
forced
to
turn
off
into
obscure
then
passing
in
haste
between
the
french
divisions
in
new
castile
it
had
finally
succeeded
in
reaching
cuenca
it
had
only
inhabitants
to
the
square
league
in
as
compared
with
in
andalusia
and
in
guipuzcoa
see
vol
infantado
finding
that
the
french
still
hung
back
and
advanced
no
further
into
his
mountain
refuge
proceeded
to
reorganize
his
army
the
three
weakened
battalions
of
the
old
line
regiments
were
consolidated
into
two
or
often
into
one
the
four
divisions
of
the
original
andalusian
host
were
amalgamated
into
two
with
an
extra
vanguard
and
reserve
composed
of
the
best
troops
this
rearrangement
had
not
yet
been
fully
completed
when
the
duke
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
venture
on
an
advance
against
madrid
he
could
learn
of
nothing
save
cavalry
in
his
front
and
he
had
received
early
notice
of
the
departure
of
napoleon
to
the
north
giving
the
command
of
his
vanguard
and
the
greater
part
of
his
cavalry
to
general
venegas
he
bade
him
descend
into
the
plains
and
endeavour
to
surprise
the
brigade
of
dragoons
which
lay
at
tarancon
this
task
venegas
attempted
to
execute
on
christmas
day
he
had
already
turned
the
town
with
half
his
force
and
placed
himself
across
the
line
of
retreat
of
the
dragoons
before
they
knew
of
his
approach
warned
just
in
time
of
his
danger
the
french
brigadier
resolved
to
cut
his
way
through
he
charged
down
on
the
enemy
who
fell
into
a
line
of
battalion
squares
with
long
intervals
between
them
dashing
between
the
squares
the
two
regiments
got
through
with
the
loss
of
fifty
or
sixty
men
the
spanish
cavalry
which
arrived
late
on
the
field
made
no
attempt
to
pursue
on
the
same
day
infantado
had
sent
out
another
column
under
general
senra
with
orders
to
march
on
aranjuez
finding
that
it
was
held
not
only
by
cavalry
but
by
a
heavy
force
of
infantry
the
spanish
brigadier
wisely
halted
at
a
discreet
distance
for
which
he
was
sharply
taken
to
task
by
his
chief
it
is
certain
that
if
he
had
gone
on
victor
would
have
made
mincemeat
of
his
little
force
of
men
for
these
changes
see
appendix
i
perreimond
s
brigade
of
s
division
although
the
advance
of
venegas
and
senra
soon
stopped
short
the
news
that
the
spaniards
were
descending
in
force
into
the
plain
of
new
castile
was
most
discomposing
to
king
joseph
who
was
at
this
moment
very
weak
in
troops
lefebvre
had
just
started
on
his
eccentric
march
to
avila
dessolles
was
not
yet
back
from
the
north
and
there
was
no
disposable
reserve
at
madrid
save
the
single
division
of
ruffin
for
the
king
s
guards
and
leval
s
germans
were
barely
enough
to
hold
down
the
capital
and
could
not
be
moved
the
situation
was
made
worse
by
the
revolt
of
several
of
the
small
towns
of
the
upper
tagus
including
chinchon
and
colmenar
which
rose
under
the
belief
that
infantado
s
army
would
soon
be
at
their
gates
there
was
nothing
between
the
duke
and
madrid
save
the
single
infantry
division
of
villatte
which
lay
with
marshal
victor
at
aranjuez
and
the
six
dragoon
regiments
of
a
force
of
little
more
than
sabres
and
bayonets
fortunately
for
king
joseph
infantado
was
a
most
incapable
general
and
allowed
his
opportunity
to
slip
by
by
driving
in
the
french
cavalry
screen
he
had
given
notice
of
his
existence
and
spread
alarm
up
to
the
gates
of
madrid
but
in
order
to
profit
by
the
situation
he
should
have
dashed
in
at
once
before
the
enemy
had
time
to
draw
together
if
he
had
marched
from
cuenca
with
his
reserves
in
the
wake
of
venegas
he
could
have
brought
men
to
bear
upon
victor
before
the
latter
could
receive
the
very
moderate
succours
that
king
joseph
could
send
him
instead
of
doing
anything
of
the
kind
he
remained
quiescent
at
his
head
quarters
and
did
not
even
send
venegas
any
further
orders
either
to
advance
or
to
retreat
from
december
to
january
the
spanish
vanguard
lay
at
tarancon
as
if
with
the
express
intention
of
giving
the
french
time
to
concentrate
the
duke
meanwhile
as
his
dispatches
show
was
drawing
up
a
grandiose
plan
of
operations
which
included
not
only
the
eviction
of
king
joseph
from
madrid
but
the
cutting
of
napoleon
s
communication
and
the
raising
of
the
siege
of
saragossa
he
was
most
anxious
to
induce
the
central
junta
to
move
forward
all
their
other
forces
to
aid
him
but
they
could
do
nothing
so
deplorable
was
the
state
of
their
army
but
bid
the
weak
division
of
men
which
was
guarding
the
sierra
morena
to
begin
a
demonstration
in
la
mancha
in
pursuance
of
this
order
del
palacio
made
a
forward
movement
as
dangerous
as
it
was
useless
to
villaharta
on
the
upper
guadiana
jourdan
and
the
intrusive
king
meanwhile
were
for
ten
days
in
a
state
of
great
anxiety
expecting
every
moment
to
hear
that
the
whole
spanish
army
had
descended
from
the
mountains
and
thrown
itself
upon
the
upper
tagus
they
ordered
victor
to
move
from
aranjuez
to
arganda
to
parry
such
a
blow
and
made
preparations
for
reinforcing
him
with
ruffin
s
division
while
the
rest
of
the
garrison
of
madrid
with
the
french
civilians
and
the
mass
of
were
to
shut
themselves
up
in
the
forts
on
the
retiro
being
too
few
to
hold
the
entire
city
but
the
expected
advance
of
infantado
never
occurred
and
jourdan
and
victor
were
able
to
put
down
the
insurrection
of
the
little
towns
in
the
plain
without
any
interruption
chinchon
was
stormed
and
the
whole
male
population
put
to
the
sword
at
colmenar
there
were
executions
on
a
large
scale
and
a
fine
of
piastres
was
levied
the
rest
of
the
insurgents
fled
to
the
hills

the
emperor
this
reinforcement
of
more
than
men

cleared

madrid
ruffin
was
sent
out
to
join
victor
who
was
ordered
to
march
at
once
on
tarancon
and
fall
upon
the
spanish
corps
which
had
remained
there
in
such
strange
torpidity
since
christmas
day
the
emperor
sending
these
orders
from
valladolid
expressed
himself
in
a
somewhat
contemptuous
strain
as
to
his
brother
s
fears
the
army
of
castaños
of
infantado
was
as
great
a
fiction
as
that
of
la
romana
rumour
made
them
strong
while
really
there
were
not
more
than
of
them
victor
had
ten
times
as
many
men
as
were
necessary
for
clearing
off
the
spaniards
the
panic
at
madrid
had
been
absurd
and
discreditable
all
that
was
wanted
was
to
catch
and
hang
a
dozen
and
the
capital
would
keep
all
these
movements
are
most
clearly
set
forth
in
jourdan
s
by
far
the
best
authority
for
the
campaign
of
ucles
and
on
january
victor
marched
from
aranjuez
with
the
battalions
of
villatte
s
and
ruffin
s
divisions
the
squadrons
of
light
horse
which
formed
his
and
the
three
brigades
of
dragoons
composing
the
division
of
in
all
some
foot
and
horse
he
did
not
find
venegas
at
tarancon
on
hearing
that
the
french
were
massing
in
front
of
him
that
officer
had
called
in
the
outlying
brigade
of
senra
and
had
retired
ten
miles
to
ucles
in
the
of
the
mountains
of
cuenca
he
sent
news
of
victor
s
approach
to
infantado
but
the
latter
gave
him
no
definite
orders
either
to
fight
or
to
retreat
he
merely
forwarded
to
him
three
or
four
more
battalions
of
infantry
and
announced
that
he
was
coming
up
from
cuenca
with
the
reserves
he
fixed
no
date
for
his
probable
arrival
much
troubled
by
the
want
of
definite
orders
venegas
doubted
whether
he
ought
to
hold
his
ground
and
await
his
chief
or
fall
back
into
the
mountains
after
some
hesitation
he
resolved
to
take
the
more
dangerous
course
tempted
by
the
fine
position
of
ucles
which
offered
every
advantage
for
a
defensive
action
he
had
with
him
about
infantry
in
very
weak
battalions
some
of
which
had
no
more
than
or
bayonets
of
cavalry
he
had
nine
incomplete
regiments
giving
only
sabres
there
were
but
five
guns
with
the
army
of
which
one
had
broken
down
and
was
not
fit
for
service
the
town
of
ucles
lies
in
the
midst
of
a
long
ridge
stretching
and
with
a
steep
slope
towards
the
plain
from
which
the
french
were
approaching
venegas
drew
up
his
men
in
a
single
long
line
with
the
town
in
the
centre
four
battalions
were
barricaded
in
ucles
six
took
post
to
the
left
of
it
eight
to
the
right
only
one
was
held
back
in
reserve
but
three
with
four
regiments
of
cavalry
were
left
out
in
front
to
observe
the
french
advance
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
village
of
tribaldos
the
four
guns
and
the
remainder
of
the
cavalry
were
drawn
up
before
the
town
it
is
almost
needless
to
point
out
the
faults
of
this
extension
and
the
want
of
a
reserve
the
position
was
too
long
for
the
numbers
available
moreover
the
men
were
not
in
good
fighting
trim
though
several
of
the
old
regiments
from
baylen
were
among
them
their
spirits
were
low
they
had
not
yet
recovered
from
the
dreadful
fatigues
of
the
retreat
from
tudela
and
they
had
little
confidence
in
their
leaders
beside
the
twenty
battalions
given
in
the
appendix
to
arteche
iv
venegas
s
narrative
shows
that
at
least
two
more
baylen
and
navas
de
tolosa
were
present
victor
marched
from
tarancon
at
daybreak
on
january
with
one
division
on
each
of
the
two
routes
which
lead
eastward
from
that
place
villatte
s
on
the
southern
road
which
goes
directly
to
ucles
ruffin
s
on
the
longer
and
more
circuitous
path
which
running
parallel
to
the
other
ultimately
rejoins
it
at
carrascosa
some
way
behind
that
town
the
majority
of
s
cavalry
accompanied
the
former
column
already
on
the
previous
night
victor
s
vedettes
had
discovered
the
spanish
outpost
at
tribaldos
very
early
on
the
following
morning
it
was
driven
in
by
the
advance
of
villatte
s
column
and
joined
the
main
body
of
the
army
of
venegas
the
marshal
then
pushed
forward
to
the
foot
of
the
hills
to
reconnoitre
the
enemy
s
position
having
discerned
the
lie
of
the
ground
and
the
distribution
of
the
spanish
forces
his
mind
was
soon
made
up
orders
were
promptly
sent
to
ruffin
to
leave
the
road
on
which
he
was
advancing
and
to
close
in
upon
the
right
flank
and
rear
of
venegas
s
army
meanwhile
villatte
and
the
cavalry
drew
up
in
front
of
ucles
with
a
strength
of
about
bayonets
and
sabres
the
dragoons
were
placed
in
the
centre
in
front
of
them
was
ranged
a
battery
which
commenced
to
shell
the
town
and
the
spanish
horse
drawn
up
before
its
gates
this
was
only
a
demonstration
the
real
blow
was
to
be
given
by
an
attack
on
the
spanish
left
where
the
hillside
was
of
easier
access
than
on
the
steep
and
rocky
northern
end
of
the
ridge
villatte
s
second
brigade
the
and
regiments
executed
a
circular
march
under
the
eyes
of
the
enemy
and
having
turned
their
extreme
flank
rapidly
climbed
the
hill
and
formed
up
at
right
angles
to
the
spanish
line
these
six
battalions
fell
upon
the
exposed
wing
and
rolled
it
up
without
much
difficulty
till
they
arrived
under
the
very
walls
of
ucles
driving
the
enemy
before
them
venegas
who
was
watching
the
fight
from
the
court
of
the
monastery
which
dominates
the
town
had
tried
to
hurry
up
reinforcements
from
his
right
wing
but
they
arrived
too
late
to
be
of
any
use
when
the
attack
on
the
enemy
s
left
was
seen
to
be
making
good
progress
and
the
attention
of
the
spaniards
was
distracted
to
that
point
victor
directed
the
first
brigade
of
villatte
s
division
to
assail
the
steep
hill
on
the
spanish
right
they
carried
it
with
ease
for
half
the
defenders
had
been
withdrawn
to
reinforce
the
left
and
the
rest
were
demoralized
by
the
evident
disaster
on
the
other
flank
the
whole
of
venegas
s
army
fled
eastward
without
any
further
endeavour
to
hold
their
ground
the
considerable
force
of
cavalry
in
the
centre
making
no
attempt
as
it
would
appear
to
cover
the
retreat
of
the
foot
such
rearguard
as
there
was
consisted
of
two
or
three
infantry
battalions
under
general
giron
suddenly
the
spaniards
of
the
right
wing
and
centre
saw
rising
up
in
front
of
them
as
they
fled
an
imposing
line
of
french
infantry
barring
their
further
progress
this
force
consisted
of
the
nine
battalions
of
ruffin
s
division
they
had
lost
their
way
while
seeking
for
the
spanish
flank
and
like
ferguson
at
roliça
made
too
wide
a
circle
to
enable
them
to
intervene
in
the
actual
fighting
but
the
very
length
of
their
turning
movement
proved
advantageous
as
they
had
now
got
into
the
direct
rear
of
the
retreating
army
driven
on
by
the
pursuing
dragoons
of
the
spaniards
found
themselves
rushing
into
the
very
arms
of
ruffin
s
division
the
disaster
was
complete
and
more
than
half
of
venegas
s
army
was
encircled
and
captured
most
of
the
cavalry
indeed
escaped
by
dispersing
and
riding
rapidly
round
the
flanks
of
ruffin
s
line
but
the
infantry
was
trapped
a
few
battalions
from
the
left
wing
got
off
to
the
and
general
giron
with
a
remnant
of
his
brigade
cut
his
way
through
a
gap
between
two
french
regiments
all
the
rest
had
to
surrender
of
venegas
s
men
about
had
been
killed
or
wounded
four
generals
seventeen
colonels
other
officers
and
rank
and
file
were
captured
the
french
secured
the
four
guns
which
formed
the
sole
artillery
of
the
beaten
army
and
twenty
standards
their
own
loss
was
insignificant
victor
returned
his
total
casualties
at
men
and
probably
did
not
much
understate
them
as
he
had
met
with
no
serious
resistance
these
numbers
are
probably
exact
jourdan
quotes
them
from
his
own
official
report
to
berthier
of
see
his
as
the
wrecks
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
battalions
had
surrendered
there
seems
no
reason
to
doubt
the
number
of
standards
but
the
spaniards
asserted
that
victor
eked
out
his
trophies
by
taking
down
the
old
of
the
knights
of
santiago
from
their
church
in
ucles
though
they
had
suffered
so
little
the
french
showed
great
ferocity
after
the
fight
they
not
only
sacked
the
town
of
ucles
but
executed
in
cold
blood
of
its
notables
including
many
monks
who
were
accused
of
having
fired
on
the
assailants
from
their
convent
windows
when
the
column
of
spanish
prisoners
was
sent
off
to
madrid
orders
were
given
it
is
said
by
victor
himself
that
those
who
would
not
keep
up
with
the
rest
should
be
shot
and
we
have
good
french
authority
to
the
effect
that
this
was
regularly
done
thirty
or
more
a
day
mostly
the
wounded
and
the
sick
were
shot
by
the
wayside
when
they
dropped
behind
cf
the
of

the

s
and

what
meanwhile
had
happened
to
the
spanish
and
the
men
whom
he
had
retained
at
cuenca

had
started
to

on
january
he
slept
that
night
at
horcajada
fifteen
miles
to
the
east
of
ucles
resuming
his
march
next
morning
he
had
got
as
far
as
carrascosa
when
a
disorderly
mob
of
routed
infantry
hurtled
into
his
vanguard
questioning
the
fugitives
he
learnt
the
details
of
the
battle
of
ucles
and
found
that
the
victorious
army
of
the
french
was
only
five
miles
away
then
with
a
promptitude
very
different
from
his
torpor
of
the
last
three
weeks
the
duke
turned
his
column
to
the
rear
and
made
off
with
all
speed
he
first
returned
to
his
base
at
cuenca
to
pick
up
his
baggage
and
stores
and
then
marched
by
vile
and
in
abominable
weather
to
chinchilla
in
the
kingdom
of
murcia
which
he
reached
on
january
his
artillery
forced
to
go
at
a
snail
s
pace
among
the
hills
and
torrents
and
escorted
by
a
single
cavalry
regiment
only
was
surprised
and
captured
by
digeon
s
dragoons
at
tortola
a
few
miles
to
the
south
of
cuenca
fifteen
guns
were
lost
on
this
occasion
several
of
the
french
authorities
ingeniously
add
them
to
the
trophies
of
ucles
and
write
as
if
they
had
all
been
taken
from
venegas
in
open
battle
notably
the
et
and
thiers
the
belmas
makes
the
spanish
prisoners
amount
to
men
two
thousand
more
than
venegas
ever
put
in
line
victor
after
occupying
cuenca
and
finding
that
infantado
was
now
too
far
away
to
be
pursued
with
any
chance
of
success
turned
down
into
the
plains
of
la
mancha
to
strike
at
the
small
andalusian
force
which
had
advanced
under
del
palacio
to
lend
countenance
to
infantado
s
projects
for
a
march
on
madrid
this
division
some
strong
had
reached
villaharta
on
the
upper
guadiana
but
when
the
news
of
ucles
arrived
its
commander
hastily
drew
it
back
to
the
foot
of
the
passes
finding
no
enemy
to
attack
victor
after
crossing
la
mancha
unopposed
took
up
his
post
at
madridejos
on
the
between
madrid
and
the
despeña
perros
and
waited
for
further
orders
from
head
quarters
it
was
only
after
the
victory
of
ucles
that
king
joseph
was
permitted
by
his
brother
to
make
his
formal
entry
into
madrid
up
to
this
moment
he
had
been
told
to
stop
at
the
palace
of
the
pardo
far
outside
the
walls
and
only
to
pay
furtive
and
unostentatious
visits
to
his
official
abode
in
the
city
when
the
inhabitants
of
the
capital
had
been
sufficiently
impressed
by
the
arrival
of
the
numerous
columns
of
the
corps
and
of
dessolles
and
had
seen
the
banners
and
the
prisoners
taken
at
ucles
paraded
through
their
streets
their
king
was
once
more
sent
among
them
joseph
made
his
appearance
on
january
passed
through
a
long
lane
of
french
bayonets
to
the
church
of
san
isidro
where
a
was
chanted
for
the
late
victories
and
then
entered
his
palace
here
he
received
numerous
deputations
of
spaniards
who
swore
him
fealty
but
the
moral
effect
of
these
oaths
was
not
very
great
for
the
local
notables
attended
under
the
pressure
of
the
bayonet
napoleon
had
sent
orders
that
every
town
in
castile
of
more
than
souls
must
dispatch
delegates
to
madrid
or
the
consequences
would
be
unpleasant
the
delegates
appeared
but
it
may
be
guessed
with
what
feelings
they
mouthed
their
oaths
and
their
protestations
of
joy
and
loyalty
yet
joseph
determined
to
play
the
part
of
the
benevolent
monarch
took
the
whole
farce
seriously
and
answered
with
lavish
declarations
of
his
love
and
sympathy
for
the
great
spanish
nation
sentiments
of
the
kind
were
to
be
the
staple
of
his
fruitless
and
copious
oratory
for
the
next
four
years
his
heart
would
have
sunk
within
him
if
only
he
could
have
recognized
their
futility
but
was
but
just
beginning
and
he
was
far
from
realizing
the
full
meaning
of
his
position
it
took
a
very
long
time
to
thoroughly
disenchant
this
and
prince
from
valladolid
section
ix
chapter
ii
napoleon
s
departure
from
spain
his
plans
for
the
termination
of
the
war
the
of
the
junta
four
days
after
the
battle
of
ucles
napoleon
quitted
spain
he
had
rested
at
valladolid
from
january
to
january
after
his
return
from
the
pursuit
of
sir
john
moore
though
he
had
failed
to
entrap
the
british
army
he
was
not
discontented
with
his
achievements
he
was
fully
convinced
that
he
had
broken
the
back
of
the
spanish
insurrection
and
that
he
could
safely
return
to
france
leaving
the
completion
of
the
work
to
his
brother
and
his
marshals
he
was
anxious
to
hear
that
saragossa
had
fallen
and
that
the
english
had
been
driven
out
of
the
peninsula
when
these
two
events
should
have
come
to
pass
his
armies
might
resume
under
the
guidance
of
his
subordinates
the
original
advance
against
portugal
and
andalusia
which
had
been
so
effectually
frustrated
by
moore
s
daring
move
meanwhile
he
spent
full
eleven
days
at
valladolid
busy
with
all
manner
of
connected
not
merely
with
spain
but
with
the
affairs
of
the
whole
continent
he
was
evidently
anxious
to
leave
an
impression
of
terror
behind
him
he
hectored
and
bullied
the
unfortunate
spanish
deputations
that
were
compelled
to
come
before
him
in
the
most
insulting
fashion
his
harangues
generally
wound
up
with
the
declaration
that
if
he
was
ever
forced
to
come
back
to
spain
in
arms
he
would
remove
his
brother
joseph
and
divide
the
realm
into
subject
provinces
which
should
be
governed
by
martial
law
some
french
soldiers
probably
marauders
having
been
assassinated
he
arrested
and
threatened
to
hang
the
whole
municipality
of
valladolid
finally
releasing
them
only
when
three
persons
accused
rightly
or
wrongly
of
the
murders
were
delated
to
him
and
executed
he
sent
advice
to
king
joseph
to
deal
in
the
same
way
with
madrid
nothing
would
keep
the
capital
quiet
he
wrote
but
a
good
string
of
executions
it
was
to
be
many
years
before
he
realized
that
hanging
did
no
good
in
spain
and
was
only
repaid
by
additional
assassinations
in
return
for
this
good
advice
to
his
brother
he
extorted
from
him
fifty
of
the
choicest
pictures
of
the
royal
gallery
at
madrid
but
in
compensation
joseph
was
invited
to
annex
all
that
he
might
choose
from
the
private
collections
of
the
exiled
spanish
nobility
and
the
monasteries
of
the
capital

suggestions
have
sometimes
been
made
that
napoleon
hastened
his
departure
from
spain
because
he
saw
that
the
suppression
of
the
insurrection
would
take
a
much
longer
time
than
he
had
originally
supposed
and
because
he
wished
to
transfer
to
other
hands
the
lengthy
and
inglorious
task
of
hunting
down
the
last
armies
of
the
junta
this
view
is
certainly
erroneous
his
three
months
stay
in
spain
had
not
opened
the
emperor
s
eyes
to
the
difficulties
of
the
business
that
he
had
taken
in
hand
though
many
of
his
couriers
and
had
already
been
ambuscaded
and
shot
by
the
peasantry
though
he
was
already
beginning
to
see
that
a
blockhouse
and
a
garrison
would
have
to
be
placed
at
every
stage
on
the
he
believed
that
these
sinister
signs
were
temporary
and
that
the
after
a
few
sanguinary
lessons
had
been
given
would
sink
down
into
the
quiet
of
despair
his
final
legacy
to
his
brother
on
departing
was
a
long
dispatch
giving
a
complete
plan
of
operations
for
the
next
campaign
soult
after
forcing
the
english
to
embark
was
to
march
on
oporto
napoleon
calculated
that
he
ought
to
capture
it
on
february
and
that
on
february
he
would
be
in
front
of
lisbon
the
portuguese
levies
he
practically
disregarded
as
a
fighting
force
and
he
was
ignorant
that
there
still
remained
or
british
troops
on
the
tagus
who
would
serve
to
stiffen
their
resistance
when
soult
should
have
captured
oporto
and
be
well
on
the
way
to
lisbon
victor
was
to
go
forward
with
his
own
corps
the
division
of
leval
from
the
corps
and
the
cavalry
of
milhaud
and
lasalle
he
was
to
strike
at
estremadura
occupy
merida
and
badajoz
and
join
hands
with
soult
along
the
tagus
lisbon
being
reduced
victor
was
to
borrow
a
division
from
soult
and
march
on
seville
with
men
with
such
a
force
as
the
emperor
calculated
he
would
subdue
the
whole
of
andalusia
with
ease
meanwhile
saragossa
must
as
napoleon
rightly
thought
fall
some
time
in
february
when
it
was
disposed
of
the
and
corps
would
provide
a
garrison
for
aragon
and
then
march
on
valencia
which
would
be
attacked
and
subdued
much
about
the
same
time
that
victor
would
arrive
at
seville
cyr
would
have
made
an
end
of
the
catalans
long
before
thus
the
whole
peninsula
would
be
subdued
ere
the
summer
was
over
there
was
nowhere
a
spanish
army
that
could
make
head
against
even
french
troops
the
only
possible
complication
would
be
that
moore
s
army
might
conceivably
take
ship
not
for
england
but
for
lisbon
or
cadiz
if
the
english
the
only
enemy
who
could
create
difficulties
took
this
course
the
emperor
might
have
to
give
further
orders
but
it
does
not
seem
that
he
regarded
this
as
a
likely
contingency
since
he
had
conceived
an
even
exaggerated
idea
of
the
losses
and
demoralization
which
the
british
had
suffered
in
the
retreat
to
corunna
to
joseph
he
wrote
reserve
yourself
for
the
expedition
to
andalusia
which
may
start
three
weeks
hence
with
men
marching
by
an
unexpected
route
by
badajoz
not
by
la
carolina
you
will
surprise
the
enemy
and
force
him
to
submit
this
is
an
operation
which
will
make
an
end
of
the
war
i
leave
the
glory
of
it
to
you
to
jerome
napoleon
he
wrote
in
the
most
laconic
style
the
spanish
affair
is
done
with
and
then
proceeded
to
discuss
the
general
politics
of
the
continent
as
if
his
whole
attention
could
now
be
given
to
the
doings
of
austria
and
russia
on
january
he
rode
out
of
valladolid
and
after
six
days
of
incessant
travel
reached
paris
on
the
his
first
care
after
his
arrival
was
to
scare
the
intriguers
of
the
capital
into
good
behaviour
his
second
was
to
endeavour
to
treat
austria
after
the
same
fashion
he
had
not
yet
made
up
his
mind
whether
the
ministers
of
francis
ii
meant
mischief
or
whether
they
had
merely
been
presuming
on
his
long
absence
in
spain
on
the
whole
he
thought
that
they
could
be
reduced
to
order
by
bold
language
and
by
the
ostentatious
movement
of
troops
on
the
rhine
and
upper
danube
but
he
was
not
sure
of
his
conclusion
in
his
correspondence
letters
stating
that
austria
has
been
brought
to
reason
alternate
with
others
in
which
she
is
accused
of
incorrigible
perversity
and
a
design
to
make
war
in
the
spring
the
emperor
s
suspicions
are
most
clearly
shown
by
the
fact
that
in
february
he
ordered
the
whole
of
the
imperial
guard
except
two
battalions
and
three
squadrons
to
be
brought
up
from
spain
and
directed
on
paris
in
the
same
month
he
sent
secret
orders
to
the
princes
of
the
confederation
of
the
rhine
to
bid
them
be
ready
to
mobilize
their
contingents
at
short
notice
napoleon
to
joseph
almost
the
same
words
are
found
in
a
dispatch
to
mollien
of
aujourd
hui
les
affaires
d
espagne
sont
à
peu
près
this
was
written
the
emperor
had
returned
to
paris
for
example
and
where
austria
is
said
to
have
changed
her
tone
and
stopped
her
preparation
with
and
which
show
a
most
hostile
spirit
against
her
for
the
details
see
written
to
bessières
from
paris
on
it
is
clear
that
as
regards
the
affairs
of
spain
the
emperor
was
in
january
and
february
as
much
deluded
as
he
had
been
seven
months
before
in
june
the
whole
plan
of
campaign
which
he
dictated
at
valladolid
and
sent
as
his
parting
gift
to
joseph
and
jourdan
was
absolutely
impracticable
and
indicated
a
fundamental
ignorance
of
the
character
of
the
spanish
war
it
would
have
been
a
perfectly
sensible
document
if
the
struggle
had
been
raging
in
italy
or
germany
though
even
there
the
calculations
of
distance
and
time
would
have
been
rather
hazardous
days
were
given
to
soult
to
expel
the
english
to
pacify
galicia
to
take
oporto
and
to
march
on
lisbon
even
granting
that
all
had
gone
as
the
emperor
desired
the
estimate
was
too
short
by
half
it
was
midwinter
galicia
and
northern
portugal
form
one
of
the
most
mountainous
regions
in
europe
their
roads
are
vile
their
food
supplies
are
scanty
their
climate
at
that
season
of
the
year
detestable
clearly
the
task
given
to
soult
could
not
be
executed
in
the
prescribed
time
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
has
been
stated
elsewhere
soult
though
working
his
hardest
did
not
leave
corunna
till
nor
take
oporto
till
march
but
this
is
a
minor
point
it
was
not
so
much
in
his
logistics
that
the
emperor
went
wrong
as
in
his
general
conception
of
the
character
of
the
war
he
imagined
that
in
dealing
with
spain
he
might
act
as
if
he
were
dealing
with
austria
or
prussia
indeed
that
he
had
an
enormous
extra
advantage
in
the
fact
that
the
armies
of
ferdinand
vii
were
infinitely
inferior
in
mere
fighting
power
to
those
of
francis
ii
or
frederick
william
iii
by
all
the
ordinary
rules
of
modern
warfare
a
nation
whose
capital
had
been
occupied
and
whose
regular
armies
had
been
routed
and
ought
to
have
submitted
without
further
trouble
the
emperor
was
a
little
surprised
that
the
effect
of
espinosa
and
gamonal
of
tudela
and
ucles
had
not
been
greater
he
had
almost
expected
to
receive
overtures
from
the
junta
asking
for
terms
of
submission
but
somewhat
disappointed
though
he
might
be
he
had
not
yet
realized
that
spain
was
not
as
other
countries
the
occupation
of
madrid
counted
for
little
or
nothing
the
insurrectionary
armies
when
driven
into
a
corner
did
not
capitulate
but
dispersed
and
fled
in
small
parties
over
the
hills
to
reunite
on
the
first
opportunity
prussian
or
austrian
troops
under
similar
circumstances
would
have
quietly
laid
down
their
arms
but
to
endeavour
to
grasp
a
spanish
corps
was
like
clutching
at
a
ball
of
quicksilver
the
mass
dispersed
in
driblets
between
the
fingers
of
the
manipulator
and
the
small
rolling
pellets
ultimately
united
to
form
a
new
force
large
captures
of
spaniards
only
took
place
on
the
actual
as
at
ucles
or
ocaña
or
when
an
army
had
shut
itself
up
in
a
fortress
and
could
not
get
away
as
happened
at
saragossa
and
badajoz
unless
actually
penned
in
between
bayonets
the
insurgents
abandoned
cannon
and
baggage
broke
their
ranks
and
disappeared
to
gather
again
on
some
more
propitious
day
either
as
fresh
armies
or
as
guerrilla
bands
operating
upon
the
victor
s
lines
of
communication
nor
was
this
all
in
italy
germany
and
austria
bonaparte
had
dealt
with
regions
where
the
population
remained
quiescent
when
once
the
regular
army
had
been
beaten
risings
like
that
of
verona
in
or
of
the
tyrol
in
were
exceptional
the
french
army
was
wont
to
go
forward
without
being
forced
to
leave
large
garrisons
behind
it
to
hold
down
the
conquered
a
battalion
or
two
placed
in
the
chief
towns
sufficed
to
secure
the
communication
of
the
army
with
france
small
parties
or
even
single
officers
bearing
dispatches
could
ride
safely
for
many
miles
through
an
italian
or
austrian
district
without
being
molested
it
was
not
thus
in
spain
the
emperor
was
to
find
that
every
village
where
there
was
not
a
french
garrison
would
be
a
focus
of
active
resistance
and
that
no
amount
of
shooting
or
hanging
would
cow
the
spirits
of
the
peasantry
it
was
only
after
scores
of
had
been
murdered
or
captured
and
after
countless
small
detachments
had
been
destroyed
that
he
came
to
realize
that
every
foot
of
spanish
soil
must
not
only
be
conquered
but
also
held
down
if
there
was
a
square
of
ten
miles
unoccupied
a
guerrilla
band
arose
in
it
if
a
district
thirty
miles
long
lacked
a
brigade
to
garrison
it
a
local
junta
with
a
ragged
apology
for
an
army
promptly
appeared
three
hundred
thousand
men
look
a
large
force
on
paper
but
when
they
have
to
hold
down
a
country
five
hundred
miles
broad
they
are
frittered
away
to
nothing
this
great
britain
knows
well
enough
from
her
recent
south
african
experience
but
it
was
not
a
common
matter
of
knowledge
in
if
the
emperor
had
been
told
on
the
day
of
his
entry
into
madrid
that
even
three
years
later
his
communication
with
bayonne
would
only
be
preserved
by
the
maintenance
of
a
fortified
post
at
every
tenth
milestone
he
would
have
laughed
the
idea
to
scorn
still
more
ridiculous
would
it
have
appeared
to
him
if
he
had
been
told
that
it
would
take
a
body
of
horse
to
carry
a
dispatch
from
salamanca
to
saragossa
or
that
the
normal
garrison
of
old
castile
would
have
to
be
kept
at
men
even
when
there
was
no
regular
spanish
army
nearer
to
it
than
oviedo
or
astorga
in
short
he
and
all
europe
had
much
to
learn
as
to
the
conditions
of
warfare
in
the
peninsula
if
he
had
realized
them
in
march
there
would
have
been
no
treachery
at
bayonne
and
the
running
sore
as
he
afterwards
called
the
spanish
war
would
never
have
broken
forth
meanwhile
the
conquest
of
spain
was
hung
up
for
a
month
and
more
after
the
victory
of
ucles
the
emperor
had
bidden
joseph
and
jourdan
to
wait
till
the
february
rains
were
over
before
sending
out
the
great
expedition
against
andalusia
the
siege
of
saragossa
was
prolonged
far
beyond
expectation
and
soult
in
galicia
as
we
shall
presently
see
found
the
which
his
master
had
set
him
inadequate
to
the
verge
of
absurdity
the
french
made
no
further
move
of
importance
till
march
the
central
junta
therefore
were
granted
three
full
months
from
the
date
of
their
flight
from
aranjuez
to
seville
in
which
to
reorganize
their
armies
for
the
oncoming
campaign
of
a
respite
which
they
gained
as
we
have
already
shown
purely
and
solely
through
moore
s
splendid
inspiration
of
the
march
to
sahagun
the
members
of
the
junta
trailed
into
seville
at
various
dates
between
december
and
december
their
rapid
journey
at
midwinter
through
the
sierra
de
guadalupe
and
the
still
wilder
sierra
morena
had
been
toilsome
and
exhausting
it
proved
fatal
to
their
old
president
florida
blanca
who
died
of
bronchitis
only
eleven
days
after
he
had
arrived
at
seville
in
his
stead
a
castilian
grandee
of
unimpeachable
patriotism
but
very
moderate
abilities
the
marquis
of
astorga
was
elected
to
the
presidential
chair
the
junta
had
no
enviable
task
before
it
the
news
of
the
disasters
on
the
ebro
and
the
fall
of
madrid
had
thrown
the
nation
into
a
paroxysm
of
unreasoning
fury
ridiculous
charges
of
treason
were
being
raised
against
all
those
who
had
been
in
charge
of
the
war
blake
and
castaños
of
all
people
were
being
openly
accused
of
having
sold
themselves
to
napoleon
there
were
a
number
of
political
assassinations
in
the
regions
to
which
the
french
had
not
yet
penetrated
most
of
the
victims
were
old
friends
of
godoy
it
looked
at
first
as
if
the
central
government
would
be
unable
to
restore
any
sort
of
order
or
to
organize
any
further
resistance
some
of
the
local
juntas
whose
importance
had
disappeared
with
the
meeting
of
the
supreme
junta
showed
signs
of
wishing
to
resume
their
ancient
independence
those
of
seville
and
jaen
were
especially
disobliging
but
the
evils
of
disunion
were
so
obvious
that
even
the
most
particularists
settled
down
after
a
time
into
at
least
a
formal
obedience
to
the
central
government
it
will
be
remembered
see
vol
that
they
went
via
talavera
merida
and
llerena
the
enforced
halt
made
by
the
french
after
napoleon
s
departure
for
madrid
was
the
salvation
of
spain
by
the
month
of
january
things
were
beginning
to
assume
a
more
regular
aspect
and
some
attempt
was
made
to
face
the
situation
the
most
favourable
part
of
that
situation
was
that
money
at
least
was
not
wanting
for
the
moment
the
four
or
five
millions
of
dollars
which
the
british
government
had
distributed
to
the
provincial
juntas
and
to
the
central
had
long
been
spent
and
in
no
more
than
in
specie
was
advanced
to
spain
spent
also
was
the
enormous
amount
of
money
accruing
from
patriotic
gifts
and
local
assessments
but
there
had
just
arrived
at
cadiz
a
large
consignment
of
specie
from
america
the
spanish
colonies
in
the
new
world
had
all
adhered
without
hesitation
to
the
cause
of
ferdinand
vii
and
their
first
and
most
copious
contribution
had
just
come
to
hand
not
only
had
the
governors
of
mexico
and
peru
and
the
other
provinces
strained
every
nerve
to
raise
money
but
a
vast
patriotic
fund
had
been
collected
by
individuals
there
were
rich
merchants
and
in
america
who
made
voluntary
offerings
of
sums
as
large
as
or
dollars
apiece
the
money
which
came
to
hand
early
in
amounted
to
more
than
and
much
more
was
received
ere
the
close
of
the
year
it
was
with
this
sum
far
more
than
with
british
money
that
the
spanish
armies
were
paid
and
fed
but
their
equipment
mainly
came
from
england
the
stores
of
arms
clothing
and
munition
which
had
existed
in
the
arsenals
of
the
peninsula
when
the
war
broke
out
had
all
been
exhausted
in
the
autumn
and
had
not
even
sufficed
to
equip
fully
the
unfortunate
armies
which
were
beaten
on
the
ebro
the
government
and
the
local
juntas
had
set
up
new
manufactories
at
seville
valencia
and
elsewhere
which
were
already
turning
out
a
large
quantity
of
weapons
accoutrements
and
uniforms
it
was
now
that
the
armies
began
to
appear
in
the
rough
brown
cloth
of
the
country
and
in
leather
shakos
abandoning
the
old
white
uniform
and
plumed
hat
which
had
been
the
garb
of
the
spanish
line
but
the
reclothing
and
rearmament
of
the
troops
could
never
have
been
completed
without
the
enormous
consignments
of
cloth
powder
muskets
lead
and
leather
work
which
came
from
england
it
is
true
that
much
was
lost
by
the
fortune
of
war
before
it
could
be
utilized
notably
the
considerable
amount
of
muskets
ammunition
and
cloth
which
had
been
landed
in
galicia
for
la
romana
s
army
this
as
we
have
seen
was
either
destroyed
by
sir
john
moore
s
army
or
captured
by
soult
because
the
galician
junta
had
kept
it
waiting
too
long
at
the
base
but
all
that
went
to
andalusia
valencia
and
catalonia
came
safely
to
hand
palafox
s
army
was
just
before
the
second
siege
of
saragossa
began
with
british
stores
sent
up
by
colonel
doyle
from
tarragona
the
armies
of
the
south
and
east
also
received
enormous
consignments
of
necessaries
it
remains
to
speak
of
the
purely
military
aspect
of
the
junta
s
position
when
january
began
the
wrecks
of
the
spanish
armies
were
distributed
in
a
wide
semicircle
reaching
from
oviedo
to
gerona
while
the
french
lay
in
their
midst
in
the
asturias
there
were
still
or
men
under
arms
the
relics
of
acevedo
s
division
of
blake
s
army
had
fallen
back
and
joined
the
other
levies
which
the
local
junta
had
assembled
the
whole
force
was
watching
the
two
lines
on
which
the
french
could
conceivably
move
during
the
winter
the
coast
route
from
santander
to
gijon
and
the
pass
of
pajares
which
leads
from
leon
to
oviedo
in
galicia
la
romana
s
army
now
engaged
in
the
miserable
retreat
from
astorga
to
orense
had
fallen
into
the
most
wretched
condition
of
the
men
who
had
been
assembled
at
leon
in
december
only
or
were
now
to
be
found
the
galician
battalions
had
melted
home
when
the
army
fell
back
among
their
native
mountains
they
can
not
be
much
blamed
for
they
were
suffering
acute
starvation
in
the
spring
they
came
back
to
join
the
colours
readily
enough
the
regulars
who
still
hung
together
were
famished
naked
and
incapable
of
any
great
exertion
their
general
s
only
care
was
to
keep
them
as
far
as
possible
from
soult
and
ney
till
the
winter
should
have
passed
by
and
food
and
clothing
be
procured
between
la
romana
s
men
at
orense
and
the
army
of
estremadura
on
the
tagus
there
was
no
spanish
force
in
the
field
when
lapisse
and
d
avenay
had
occupied
zamora
and
salamanca
the
only
centre
of
resistance
in
leon
was
the
fortress
of
ciudad
rodrigo
which
was
held
by
a
handful
of
local
militia
portuguese
troops
were
beginning
to
collect
in
its
rear
at
almeida
but
with
them
the
junta
had
nothing
to
do
the
estremaduran
army
had
now
passed
from
the
hands
of
galluzzo
to
those
of
cuesta
the
junta
in
spite
of
the
memories
of
cabezon
and
rio
seco
had
once
more
given
the
obstinate
and
incapable
old
soldier
an
important
command
apparently
they
had
been
moved
by
the
widespread
but
idiotic
cry
imputing
treachery
to
the
generals
who
had
been
beaten
on
the
ebro
and
gave
cuesta
an
army
because
with
all
his
faults
no
one
ever
dreamed
of
accusing
him
of
treachery
or
sympathy
with
the
french
his
forces
consisted
of
the
wrecks
of
belvedere
s
army
from
gamonal
of
the
débris
of
san
juan
s
army
from
madrid
of
new
estremaduran
levies
which
had
not
gone
forward
to
burgos
in
october
but
had
remained
behind
to
complete
their
organization
of
the
four
dismounted
cavalry
regiments
from
denmark
which
had
been
sent
to
the
south
when
la
romana
landed
at
santander
in
order
to
procure
equipment
and
horses
in
all
the
army
of
cuesta
had
no
more
than
foot
and
or
horse
the
spirit
of
the
old
troops
of
san
juan
and
belvedere
was
still
very
bad
and
they
were
hardly
recovered
from
their
december
mutinies
and
murders
after
lefebvre
had
driven
them
back
from
the
tagus
and
occupied
the
bridges
of
almaraz
and
arzobispo
the
estremadurans
had
retired
to
merida
and
truxillo
on
january
their
most
advanced
position
was
at
the
place
to
the
east
of
estremadura
lay
the
weakest
point
of
the
spanish
line
andalusia
and
its
mountain
barrier
of
the
sierra
morena
were
almost
undefended
in
january
it
will
be
remembered
that
all
through
the
autumn
of
the
preceding
year
the
local
juntas
intoxicated
with
the
fumes
of
baylen
had
let
the
months
slip
by
without
doing
much
to
organize
the
army
of
reserve
of
which
they
had
spoken
so
much
in
august
and
september
it
resulted
that
when
reding
had
marched
for
catalonia
and
the
last
belated
fractions
of
castaños
army
had
been
forwarded
to
madrid
andalusia
was
almost
destitute
of
troops
when
the
junta
fled
to
seville
it
looked
around
for
an
army
with
which
to
defend
the
passes
of
the
sierra
morena
nothing
of
the
kind
existed
the
only
force
available
consisted
of
nine
or
ten
battalions
mainly
new
levies
which
were
dispersed
through
the
four
kingdoms
completing
their
armament
and
organization
they
were
hastily
mobilized
and
pushed
forward
to
the
sierra
morena
but
not
more
than
bayonets
and
sabres
could
be
collected
this
was
the
sole
force
that
lay
between
the
french
at
madrid
and
the
junta
at
seville
the
charge
of
the
division
whose
head
quarters
were
placed
at
la
carolina
was
given
to
the
marquis
del
palacio
who
in
the
general
shifting
of
commanders
had
just
been
recalled
from
catalonia
the
british
government
s
knowledge
of
the
danger
to
which
andalusia
was
exposed
from
the
absolute
want
of
troops
to
defend
it
led
to
an
untoward
incident
which
did
much
to
endanger
its
friendly
relations
with
the
junta
on
hearing
of
the
fall
of
madrid
and
of
moore
s
retreat
towards
galicia
canning
harked
back
to
one
of
his
old
ideas
of
the
previous
summer
the
notion
that
british
troops
might
be
sent
to
the
south
of
spain
if
a
safe
basis
for
their
operations
were
secured
this
as
the
secretary
of
state
for
foreign
affairs
believed
would
best
be
provided
by
the
establishment
of
a
garrison
in
cadiz
it
was
that
this
great
centre
of
commerce
should
not
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
french
and
early
in
january
it
was
known
in
london
that
there
was
no
adequate
spanish
force
ready
to
defend
the
passes
of
andalusia
if
napoleon
had
an
army
large
enough
to
provide
not
only
for
the
pursuit
of
moore
but
for
the
dispatch
of
a
strong
corps
for
an
attack
on
seville
it
seemed
probable
that
the
french
might
overrun
southern
spain
as
far
as
the
sea
without
meeting
with
serious
opposition
accordingly
canning
wrote
to
frere
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
new
year
to
offer
the
assistance
of
a
considerable
british
force
for
the
defence
of
andalusia
if
cadiz
were
placed
in
their
hands
the
question
of
the
employment
of
a
british
army
in
the
south
of
spain
he
wrote
depends
essentially
upon
the
disposition
of
the
spanish
government
to
receive
a
corps
of
that
army
into
cadiz
without
the
security
to
be
afforded
by
that
fortress
it
is
impossible
to
hazard
the
army
in
the
interior
after
the
example
of
the
little
which
sir
john
moore
represents
himself
to
have
received
from
the
spaniards
in
the
north
in
consequence
of
the
imminent
danger
and
of
the
pressing
necessity
for
immediate
decision
arising
from
sir
john
moore
s
retreat
and
from
the
defenceless
state
in
which
you
represent
andalusia
to
be
his
majesty
s
government
have
deemed
it
right
without
waiting
for
the
result
of
your
communication
with
the
central
junta
to
send
a
force
direct
to
cadiz
to
be
admitted
into
that
fortress
four
thousand
men
under
sherbrooke
are
directed
to
sail
immediately
and
he
is
informed
that
he
is
to
expect
instructions
from
you
on
his
arrival
containing
the
determination
of
the
spanish
government
respecting
his
admission
into
cadiz
in
the
event
of
a
refusal
of
the
junta
to
afford
this
proof
of
confidence
sherbrooke
is
directed
to
proceed
to
gibraltar
canning
to
frere
record
office
the
last
paragraph
of
this
dispatch
shows
that
canning
s
intentions
were
perfectly
honourable
and
that
he
did
not
intend
to
bring
any
pressure
to
bear
upon
the
junta
in
the
event
of
their
refusing
to
admit
a
british
garrison
into
cadiz
his
views
were
founded
upon
the
information
available
in
london
when
he
wrote
and
he
was
under
the
impression
that
a
french
army
might
probably
be
marching
upon
seville
at
the
moment
when
his
letter
would
reach
frere
s
hands
but
as
we
have
seen
the
diversion
of
the
main
force
of
napoleon
s
army
of
invasion
against
moore
had
rendered
any
such
expedition
impossible
and
no
immediate
danger
was
really
to
be
apprehended
the
same
idea
however
had
entered
into
frere
s
mind
and
long
before
he
received
canning
s
dispatch
he
had
been
sounding
members
of
the
central
junta
as
to
the
way
in
which
they
would
look
on
a
proposal
to
send
british
troops
to
cadiz
the
answer
which
he
received
from
their
secretary
martin
de
garay
was
not
reassuring
don
martin
energetically
repudiated
the
project
there
would
be
no
objection
he
said
to
admit
a
garrison
if
cadiz
became
the
ultimate
point
of
retreat
of
the
armies
and
government
of
spain
but
the
danger
that
had
appeared
so
pressing
some
weeks
before
had
passed
by
the
french
had
stopped
their
advance
and
the
junta
were
now
hoping
to
defend
estremadura
and
the
course
of
the
tagus
the
invaders
as
they
trusted
would
be
met
and
checked
on
the
line
of
alcantara
and
almaraz
they
deprecated
any
sending
of
british
troops
to
cadiz
and
hoped
that
lisbon
would
be
the
point
to
which
reinforcements
would
be
dispatched
as
its
evacuation
would
have
deplorable
results
de
garay
in
a
second
letter
spoke
of
rumours
to
the
effect
that
cradock
was
proposing
to
evacuate
portugal
and
trusted
that
they
were
not
true
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
and
that
timid
commander
was
already
making
secret
preparations
to
embark
frere
gave
up
for
the
present
any
idea
of
pressing
the
project
further
unless
the
french
should
recommence
their
advance
on
andalusia
he
had
not
yet
received
canning
s
dispatch
from
london
and
did
not
know
that
the
home
government
had
taken
to
heart
the
plan
for
occupying
cadiz
and
sending
a
large
expedition
to
andalusia
but
on
february
before
any
hint
of
the
kind
had
reached
him
he
was
informed
by
a
dispatch
from
lisbon
that
troops
had
been
already
sent
off
to
cadiz
this
step
was
the
work
of
sir
george
smith
one
of
the
numerous
british
military
agents
in
the
peninsula
who
had
taken
upon
himself
to
force
events
to
an
issue
without
first
taking
the
precaution
of
communicating
either
with
the
home
government
or
the
british
ambassador
at
seville
smith
was
a
hasty
and
presumptuous
man
full
of
zeal
without
discretion
the
defencelessness
of
andalusia
had
impressed
him
just
as
it
had
impressed
canning
and
frere
but
instead
of
opening
communications
with
the
junta
as
they
had
both
done
he
had
merely
written
in
very
urgent
terms
to
cradock
and
adjured
him
to
detach
troops
from
the
scanty
garrison
of
portugal
in
order
to
secure
cadiz
the
general
when
thus
pressed
consented
to
fall
in
with
the
scheme
and
set
aside
a
brigade
under
mackenzie
which
he
shipped
off
from
lisbon
at
hours
notice
february
he
also
ordered
the
regiment
then
in
garrison
at
elvas
to
march
on
seville
both
cradock
and
smith
were
gravely
to
blame
for
they
had
no
authorization
to
attempt
to
occupy
cadiz
without
obtaining
the
consent
of
the
spanish
government
they
should
have
consulted
both
frere
and
the
junta
before
moving
a
man
but
it
was
only
when
the
troops
had
actually
embarked
that
they
thought
fit
to
notify
their
action
to
the
ambassador
at
seville
the
and
regiments
as
canning
wrote
to
frere
after
receiving
the
news
of
the
abortive
expedition
the
enclosed
copy
of
the
instructions
under
which
sir
smith
was
sent
out
will
show
you
that
the
step
taken
by
that
officer
was
not
to
have
been
taken
at
the
direct
solicitation
of
the
spanish
he
has
been
directed
to
leave
cadiz
at
once
and
you
may
assure
the
junta
that
no
separate
or
secret
commission
was
has
been
or
ever
will
be
entrusted
to
any
officer
or
other
person
record
office
on
receiving
their
letters
frere
was
placed
in
an
unenviable
position
having
just
seen
his
own
proposals
negatived
by
the
junta
in
polite
but
decisive
terms
he
now
learnt
that
a
british
force
had
been
sent
off
to
carry
out
precisely
the
plan
which
the
spaniards
had
refused
to
take
into
consideration
four
days
later
he
was
informed
that
mackenzie
s
brigade
which
had
chanced
upon
a
favourable
wind
was
actually
lying
in
cadiz
harbour
and
that
sir
george
smith
was
endeavouring
to
induce
the
local
authorities
of
the
place
to
permit
them
to
land
the
junta
as
was
inevitable
suspected
frere
of
having
been
in
the
plot
and
imagined
that
he
was
trying
to
force
their
hand
by
the
display
of
armed
force
cadiz
was
at
smith
s
mercy
for
it
was
only
garrisoned
by
its
urban
guards
and
the
populace
were
by
no
means
unwilling
to
see
the
british
land
for
the
fear
of
the
french
was
upon
them
and
they
welcomed
the
approach
of
reinforcements
of
any
kind
the
supreme
authority
in
cadiz
at
this
moment
was
the
marquis
of
villel
a
special
commissioner
sent
down
by
the
central
junta
of
which
he
was
a
member
he
refused
to
be
cajoled
by
smith
and
very
properly
referred
his
demand
for
permission
to
disembark
to
the
government
at
seville
the
latter
not
unnaturally
incensed
turned
for
explanations
to
frere
the
ambassador
s
conduct
when
placed
in
this
dilemma
was
by
no
means
wise
or
straightforward
instead
of
frankly
disavowing
smith
s
action
he
adopted
the
tortuous
course
of
pretending
that
the
expedition
from
lisbon
had
been
sent
with
his
knowledge
and
consent
but
that
he
would
not
allow
it
to
land
without
the
leave
of
the
junta
the
spaniards
replied
in
terms
of
some
indignation
and
returned
a
frank
negative
to
the
demand
their
secretary
de
garay
wrote
that
the
unexpected
appearance
of
general
mackenzie
s
force
was
painful
and
disagreeable
intelligence
cadiz
being
no
longer
in
danger
from
the
french
and
two
spanish
regiments
being
already
on
their
way
to
reinforce
the
garrison
the
measure
which
had
been
taken
would
admit
of
a
thousand
interpretations
and
a
consent
to
hand
over
the
fortress
to
the
british
would
compromise
the
central
junta
with
the
whole
the
fact
was
that
spanish
public
opinion
was
strongly
opposed
to
allowing
the
british
to
obtain
a
foothold
in
cadiz
there
was
a
notion
abroad
that
if
once
occupied
the
place
might
be
kept
permanently
in
our
hands
and
be
turned
into
a
second
gibraltar
frere
by
his
own
showing
exceeded
the
bounds
of
diplomatic
evasion
he
writes
to
canning
to
say
that
the
dispatch
of
the
lisbon
troops
had
been
a
complete
surprise
to
him
as
he
had
not
received
any
information
on
the
subject
it
occurred
to
me
however
that
it
was
best
to
take
it
upon
myself
and
to
affect
to
consider
it
a
thing
of
course
and
to
say
that
i
had
sent
orders
in
conformity
with
the
note
which
i
had
received
from
de
garay
in
order
to
give
this
some
semblance
of
truth
i
did
afterwards
write
a
letter
to
lisbon
to
this
effect
and
sent
it
off
before
i
dispatched
my
note
to
de

this
did
not
prevent
me
from
being
assailed
by
finally
he
proceeded
to
tell
the
junta
that
he
only
wished
to
see
cadiz
occupied
in
the
extreme
case
of
an
immediate
attack
by
the
french
record
office
unfortunately
for
the
credit
of
great
britain
with
her
allies
tumults
broke
out
at
cadiz
within
a
few
days
of
the
arrival
of
mackenzie
s
army
which
supplied
an
excuse
to
malevolent
spaniards
for
attributing
the
worst
motives
to
their
allies
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
not
stirred
up
by
sir
george
smith
or
any
other
emissary
of
the
british
government
but
were
the
results
of
the
eccentric
behaviour
of
the
marquis
de
villel
this
personage
was
a
very
strange
character
a
sort
of
spanish
puritan
with
a
taste
for
playing
the
benevolent
despot
he
attributed
the
misfortunes
of
his
country
and
not
without
much
reason
to
her
moral
decadence
his
idea
of
the
way
to
commence
her
regeneration
was
peculiar
considering
the
circumstances
of
the
time
he
issued
an
edict
commanding
all
married
pairs
living
apart
to
reunite
issued
laws
repressing
late
hours
and
gambling
legislated
concerning
the
length
of
ladies
skirts
and
organized
a
grand
against
women
of
light
reputation
of
whom
he
imprisoned
some
scores
when
he
proceeded
to
engage
in
a
sort
of
moral
inquisition
into
the
private
life
of
all
classes
he
naturally
became
very
unpopular
and
on
the
first
opportunity
the
populace
rose
against
him
he
had
ordered
into
the
city
a
swiss
battalion
raised
from
the
prisoners
of
dupont
s
army
and
other
deserters
of
all
nationalities
the
cry
was
raised
by
his
enemies
that
he
was
admitting
frenchmen
in
disguise
into
the
sacred
fortress
with
the
purpose
of
betraying
it
to
the
enemy
other
rumours
were
put
about
to
the
effect
that
he
was
deliberately
neglecting
the
fortifications
and
supplying
the
batteries
with
powder
adulterated
with
sand
for
villel
s
eccentricities
in
detail
see
toreno
pp
and
arteche
see
leslie
of
the
when
the
foreign
battalion
drew
near
to
cadiz
on
february
and
began
to
march
up
the
long
spit
which
connects
the
city
with
the
isla
de
leon
the
storm
burst
a
mixed
multitude
of
rioters
shut
the
gates
against
the
troops
and
then
swept
the
streets
maltreating
villel
s
subordinates
and
slaying
don
josé
heredia
the
commander
of
the
a
person
very
unpopular
with
the
smugglers
who
formed
an
appreciable
element
in
the
crowd
the
high
commissioner
himself
was
besieged
in
his
house
hunted
from
it
and
nearly
murdered
he
only
escaped
by
the
kind
offices
of
the
head
of
a
capuchin
convent
who
took
him
within
his
gates
and
made
himself
responsible
to
the
rioters
for
keeping
the
refugee
in
safe
custody
the
mob
next
tried
to
break
open
the
state
prison
for
the
purpose
of
slaying
general
caraffa
and
other
political
captives
fortunately
felix
jones
the
military
governor
succeeded
in
saving
these
unhappy
persons
by
the
not
aid
of
the
urban
guards
many
of
whom
had
joined
in
the
outbreak
the
rioters
expressed
great
friendliness
for
the
british
and
many
of
them
kept
inviting
the
troops
in
the
offing
to
come
ashore
it
was
very
lucky
that
no
attention
was
paid
to
these
solicitations
for
if
they
had
landed
the
worst
suspicions
of
the
junta
would
have
appeared
justified
and
the
insurrection
would
have
been
attributed
to
the
machinations
of
frere
or
smith
fortunately
the
latter
had
died
only
a
few
days
before
the
troubles
broke
out
the
victim
of
a
fever
which
carried
him
off
after
no
more
than
hours
of
illness
if
he
had
survived
till
the
he
would
have
been
quite
capable
of
taking
the
fatal
step
of
listening
to
the
appeals
of
the
rioters
and
ordering
the
troops
ashore
mackenzie
wrote
that
it
was
evident
that
the
people
were
favourable
to
our
landing
and
occupying
the
town
for
it
was
frequently
called
for
during
the
but
the
utmost
care
was
taken
to
prevent
our
officers
or
soldiers
from
taking
any
part
whatever
on
this
occasion
and
except
when
i
was
applied
to
by
the
governor
for
the
interference
of
some
british
officers
as
mediators
we
stood
perfectly
dispatch
to
castlereagh
in
the
record
office
dated
lisbon
march
as
it
turned
out
the
whole
expedition
ended
in
an
absurd
fiasco
when
the
riots
had
died
down
the
junta
recalled
the
eccentric
de
villel
but
they
would
not
listen
to
any
proposals
from
frere
for
admitting
british
troops
into
cadiz
even
when
he
suggested
that
only
two
battalions
should
remain
there
while
the
rest
including
sherbrooke
s
division
which
was
expected
to
arrive
in
a
few
days
should
come
up
and
join
the
regiment
at
seville
with
the
ultimate
purpose
of
marching
into
estremadura
the
junta
replied
that
the
loyalty
of
the
british
ministry
and
the
generosity
of
its
efforts
to
assist
spain
were
beyond
suspicion
but
the
national
government
must
respect
national
prejudices
and
avoid
exposing
itself
to
censure
if
there
were
any
urgent
danger
they
would
have
no
hesitation
in
admitting
the
troops
of
their
allies
into
cadiz
but
the
french
were
still
far
away
and
there
was
no
immediate
prospect
of
their
approach
the
british
expedition
would
be
more
usefully
employed
in
catalonia
or
in
some
other
theatre
of
war
than
in
cadiz
by
march
when
this
final
answer
was
sent
to
frere
the
state
of
affairs
had
so
much
changed
that
the
representations
made
by
the
junta
were
more
or
less
correct
the
imminent
danger
which
had
existed
in
january
had
passed
away
martin
de
garay
to
frere
march
record
office
accordingly
after
lying
idly
for
four
weeks
in
their
transports
and
gazing
with
much
unsatisfied
curiosity
on
the
white
houses
the
green
shutters
and
the
flat
roofs
of
cadiz
across
the
beautiful
bay
mackenzie
s
regiments
set
sail
again
for
lisbon
on
march
as
they
ran
out
of
the
harbour
they
met
sherbrooke
s
belated
convoy
whose
arrival
had
been
delayed
by
fearful
tempests
in
the
bay
of
biscay
the
whole
force
bayonets
strong
was
brought
back
to
portugal
it
might
have
been
of
infinite
service
to
cradock
if
it
had
remained
at
lisbon
and
had
never
been
sent
to
cadiz
and
its
presence
might
have
induced
him
to
adopt
measures
less
timid
and
futile
than
those
which
as
we
shall
see
he
had
pursued
during
january
and
february
napier
enlarges
on
this
incident
at
great
length
in
pages
of
his
second
volume
in
his
persistent
dislike
for
canning
castlereagh
and
frere
as
well
as
for
the
spaniards
he
concludes
that
the
business
indicated
an
unsettled
policy
shallow
combination
and
had
agents
on
the
part
of
the
british
cabinet
and
an
unwise
and
unworthy
disposition
in
the
supreme
junta
while
smith
was
zealous
and
acute
and
cradock
full
of
zeal
and
moral
it
is
hard
to
give
an
unqualified
assent
to
any
one
of
these
views
smith
was
wrong
in
acting
without
giving
any
notice
of
his
intentions
to
the
junta
cradock
s
zeal
was
equally
untempered
by
discretion
the
british
cabinet
acting
on
the
information
available
in
the
end
of
december
was
right
to
be
anxious
about
cadiz
and
equally
right
to
abandon
its
attempt
to
occupy
the
place
in
march
when
the
conditions
of
the
war
had
changed
and
the
junta
had
shown
its
dislike
to
the
proposal
as
to
the
spaniards
the
matter
was
only
broached
to
them
in
february
when
the
danger
of
an
immediate
french
advance
had
passed
away
and
they
were
entirely
justified
in
their
answer
which
was
framed
as
politely
as
could
be
contrived
we
must
not
blame
them
overmuch
for
their
suspicion
england
though
now
a
friend
had
long
been
an
enemy
and
the
fate
of
gibraltar
was
always
before
their
eyes
but
this
unfortunate
incident
has
detained
us
too
long
we
must
return
to
the
state
of
the
spanish
armies
at
the
end
of
the
month
of
january
beyond
the
levies
of
the
marquis
del
palacio
at
la
carolina
there
was
a
long
gap
in
the
spanish
line
of
defence
the
next
force
under
arms
was
the
army
of
infantado
now
engaged
in
its
exhausting
winter
march
from
cuenca
to
the
murcian
border
after
the
rout
of
ucles
it
was
still
strong
though
destitute
of
all
supplies
and
not
fit
for
immediate
service
the
junta
ordered
it
to
march
from
chinchilla
to
join
del
palacio
s
force
at
the
mouth
of
the
despeña
perros
and
so
to
strengthen
the
defences
of
andalusia
this
was
done
and
the
two
forces
were
safely
united
so
that
when
a
few
more
new
battalions
had
been
brought
up
from
granada
men
were
placed
between
victor
and
andalusia
the
junta
removed
infantado
from
command
rightly
judging
that
he
had
sacrificed
venegas
at
ucles
by
his
neglect
to
send
orders
and
his
sloth
in
coming
up
to
join
his
subordinate
the
charge
of
the
force
at
la
carolina
still
called
the
army
of
the
centre
was
made
over
to
general
cartaojal
beyond
infantado
s
depleted
corps
lay
the
army
of
valencia
its
nucleus
was
the
remains
of
the
old
division
of
llamas
and
roca
which
had
served
with
castaños
at
tudela
the
local
junta
rapidly
recruited
this
skeleton
force
from
up
to
men
they
added
to
it
several
new
regiments
raised
during
the
winter
in
valencia
and
murcia
and
by
february
had
men
available
for
succouring
aragon
and
catalonia
though
their
quality
left
much
to
be
desired
see
the
table
in
argüelles
on
of
his
a
little
further
north
palafox
was
still
holding
out
with
splendid
desperation
in
saragossa
where
he
had
shut
himself
up
with
the
whole
army
of
aragon
his
original
men
were
already
much
thinned
by
pestilence
and
the
sword
but
in
january
their
spirit
was
yet
unbroken
and
though
it
was
clear
that
they
were
doomed
to
final
destruction
if
they
were
not
relieved
from
the
outside
yet
they
were
still
doing
excellent
work
in
detaining
in
front
of
them
the
whole
of
the
and
french
army
corps
there
yet
remains
to
be
described
the
strongest
of
all
the
spanish
armies
that
of
catalonia
in
addition
to
the
original
garrison
of
the
province
and
to
its
gallant
and
there
had
been
gradually
drafted
into
the
principality
the
greater
part
of
the
garrison
of
the
balearic
isles
some
men
reding
s
granadan
division
which
started
from
its
home
over
strong
men
of
caraffa
s
old
division
from
portugal
the
marquis
of
lazan
s
aragonese
division
from
the
side
of
lerida
about
bayonets
thus
in
all
some
men
in
organized
corps
had
been
massed
in
catalonia
and
the
added
some
irregulars
of
course
the
spanish
strength
in
january
did
not
reach
these
figures
many
men
had
been
lost
at
the
siege
of
rosas
and
in
the
battles
of
cardadeu
and
molins
de
rey
yet
there
were
still
troops
of
one
sort
or
another
available
the
spirit
of
the
country
was
irritated
rather
than
lowered
by
the
late
defeats
the
french
only
occupied
the
ground
that
was
within
the
actual
circle
of
fire
of
their
garrisons
if
the
catalans
had
been
content
to
avoid
general
engagements
and
to
maintain
an
incessant
guerrilla
warfare
they
might
have
held
their
own
though
the
enemy
had
a
very
capable
commander
in
general
cyr
they
had
as
yet
accomplished
nothing
more
than
the
capture
of
the
antiquated
fortress
of
rosas
the
relief
of
barcelona
and
the
winning
of
two
fruitless
battles
catalonia
remained
unsubdued
till
the
very
end
of
the
struggle
reckoning
up
all
their
armies
the
junta
had
in
the
end
of
january
some
men
in
arms
a
force
insufficient
to
face
the
french
in
the
open
for
the
latter
even
after
the
departure
of
the
imperial
guard
had
still
nearly
sabres
and
bayonets
south
of
the
pyrenees
but
one
quite
capable
of
keeping
up
the
national
resistance
if
it
were
only
conducted
upon
the
proper
lines
for
as
napoleon
and
his
marshals
had
yet
to
learn
no
spanish
district
could
be
considered
conquered
unless
a
garrison
was
left
in
each
of
its
towns
and
flying
columns
kept
in
continual
motion
through
the
open
country
of
the
french
who
now
lay
in
spain
more
than
half
were
really
wanted
for
garrison
duty
a
district
like
galicia
was
capable
of
keeping
men
employed
even
the
plains
of
old
castile
and
leon
swallowed
up
whole
divisions
on
see
napier
s
extracts
from
the
imperial
muster
rolls
i
these
numbers
include
the
sick
and
detached
but
unfortunately
for
spain
the
mania
for
fighting
pitched
battles
was
still
obsessing
the
minds
of
her
generals
within
a
few
weeks
three
wholly
unnecessary
and
disastrous
engagements
were
to
be
risked
at
valls
ciudad
real
and
medellin
instead
of
playing
a
cautious
defensive
game
and
harassing
the
french
the
spaniards
persisted
in
futile
attempts
to
face
the
enemy
in
general
actions
for
which
their
troops
were
wholly
unsuited
the
results
were
so
deplorable
that
but
for
a
second
british
intervention
wellesley
s
march
to
talavera
andalusia
would
have
been
in
as
great
peril
in
july
as
it
had
been
in
january
the
central
junta
must
take
its
share
of
the
responsibility
for
this
fact
no
less
than
the
spanish
generals
it
still
persisted
in
its
old
error
of
refusing
to
appoint
a
single
so
that
each
army
fought
for
its
own
hand
without
any
attempt
to
its
actions
with
those
of
the
others
indeed
several
of
the
generals
were
at
notorious
enmity
with
their
colleagues
notably
cuesta
and
venegas
it
was
to
no
purpose
that
the
central
government
displayed
great
energy
in
organizing
men
and
collecting
material
if
when
the
armies
had
been
equipped
and
sent
to
the
front
they
were
used
piecemeal
without
any
general
strategical
scheme
and
led
ere
long
to
some
miserable
disaster
such
as
ucles
or
medellin
or
ocaña
the
junta
the
generals
and
the
nation
were
all
alike
possessed
by
the
delusion
that
with
energy
and
sufficient
numbers
they
might
on
some
happy
morning
achieve
a
second
baylen
but
for
such
a
consummation
duponts
and
vedels
are
required
and
when
no
such
convenient
adversaries
were
to
be
found
the
attempt
to
encompass
and
beat
a
french
army
was
certain
to
end
in
a
catastrophe
the
only
spanish
fighters
who
were
playing
the
proper
game
in
were
the
catalonian
and
even
they
gave
battle
far
too
often
and
did
not
adhere
with
a
sufficient
pertinacity
to
the
harassing
tactics
of
guerrilla
warfare
general
arteche
has
collected
in
his
fourth
volume
something
like
a
dozen
schemes
for
the
expulsion
of
the
french
from
spain
which
were
laid
before
the
junta
or
ventilated
in
print
during
this
year
it
is
interesting
to
see
that
only
one
of
them
advocates
the
true
line
of
resistance
the
avoiding
of
battles
the
harassing
of
the
enemy
s
flanks
and
communications
and
the
employment
of
numerous
flying
bands
instead
of
great
masses
some
of
the
other
plans
are
the
wild
imaginings
of
ignorant
fools
one
wiseacre
wished
to
run
down
the
french
columns
with
pikemen
in
a
sort
of
macedonian
phalanx
another
to
arm
of
the
troops
with
but
the
majority
of
the
junta
s
advisers
thought
that
numbers
were
the
only
necessary
thing
and
proposed
to
save
spain
by
crushing
the
invaders
with
levies
of
all
persons
between
sixteen
and
fifty
one
enthusiast
makes
the
fourteen
to
seventy
see
arteche
iv
the
advocate
of
the
guerrilla
game
was
a
certain
faustino
fernandez
these
were
the
views
of
the
nation
and
the
generals
and
the
junta
were
but
infected
with
the
common
delusion
of
all
their
compatriots
they
would
not
see
that
courage
and
raw
multitudes
are
almost
helpless

opposed

equal
courage

eastern
coast
at
the
point
where
it
was
left
in
section
the
same
torpor
which
was
notable
in
the
operations
of
the
main
armies
of
the
spaniards
and
the
french
during
the
months
of
september
and
october
was
to
be
observed
in
catalonia
also
on
the
ter
and
the
llobregat
the
inability
of
the
french
to
move
was
much
more
real
and
the
slackness
of
the
spaniards
even
more
inexplicable
than
on
the
ebro
and
the
aragon
in
the
early
days
of
september
the
situation
of
the
invaders
was
most
perilous
after
the
disastrous
failure
of
the
second
siege
of
gerona
it
will
be
remembered
that
reille
had
withdrawn
to
figueras
close
to
the
french
frontier
while
duhesme
had
cut
his
way
back
to
barcelona
after
sacrificing
all
his
artillery
and
his
baggage
on
the
way
both
commanders
proceeded
to
report
to
the
emperor
that
there
was
need
for
ample
reinforcements
of
veteran
troops
or
a
catastrophe
must
inevitably
ensue
meanwhile
reille
preserved
a
defensive
attitude
at
the
foot
of
the
pyrenees
while
duhesme
could
do
no
more
than
hold
barcelona
and
as
much
of
its
suburban
plain
as
he
could
safely
occupy
without
risking
overmuch
his
outlying
detachments
he
foresaw
a
famine
in
the
winter
and
devoted
all
his
energies
to
seizing
and
sending
into
the
town
all
foodstuffs
that
he
could
find
in
the
neighbourhood
his
position
was
most
uncomfortable
the
late
expedition
had
reduced
his
force
from
to
sabres
and
bayonets
the
men
were
demoralized
and
when
sent
out
to
forage
saw
behind
every
bush
and
rock
the
populace
of
barcelona
was
awaiting
a
good
opportunity
for
an
and
was
in
constant
communication
with
the
insurgents
outside
the
blockade
was
not
as
yet
kept
up
by
any
large
section
of
the
s
regular
troops
nor
had
any
attempt
been
made
to
run
lines
around
the
place
it
was
conducted
by
an
elastic
cordon
of
four
or
five
thousand
supported
by
no
more
than
infantry
of
the
regular
army
and
possessing
five
or
six
the
charge
of
the
whole
line
was
given
to
the
conde
de
caldagues
who
had
so
much
distinguished
himself
in
the
previous
month
by
his
relief
of
gerona
he
had
been
entrusted
with
a
force
too
small
to
man
a
circuit
of
twelve
or
fifteen
miles
so
that
duhesme
had
no
difficulty
in
pushing
sorties
through
the
line
of
spanish
posts
whenever
he
chose
to
send
out
a
sufficiently
strong
column
but
any
body
that
pressed
out
too
far
in
pursuit
of
corn
or
forage
risked
being
beset
and
mishandled
on
its
return
march
by
the
whole
of
the
of
the
hence
there
was
a
limit
to
the
power
to
roam
of
even
the
largest
expeditions
that
duhesme
could
spare
from
his
depleted
garrison
the
fighting
along
the
blockading
cordon
was
incessant
but
never
conclusive
on
september
a
strong
column
of
six
italian
battalions
swept
aside
the
spaniards
for
a
moment
in
the
direction
of
san
boy
but
a
smaller
expedition
against
the
bridge
of
molins
de
rey
was
repulsed
the
moment
that
the
italians
returned
to
barcelona
with
the
food
that
they
had
scraped
together
in
the
villages
caldagues
reoccupied
his
old
positions
there
were
many
skirmishes
but
no
large
sorties
between
september
and
october
when
milosewitz
took
out
men
for
a
in
the
valley
of
the
besos
he
pierced
the
blockading
line
routing
the
of
milans
at
san
jeronimo
de
la
murtra
and
penetrated
as
far
as
granollers
twenty
miles
from
barcelona
where
he
made
an
invaluable
seizure
the
food
dépôt
of
the
eastern
section
of
the
investing
force
but
he
was
now
dangerously
distant
from
his
base
and
as
he
was
returning
with
his
captures
caldagues
fell
upon
him
at
san
culgat
with
troops
brought
from
other
parts
of
the
blockading
line
the
italians
were
routed
with
a
loss
of
men
and
their
convoy
was
recaptured
after
this
duhesme
made
no
more
attempts
to
send
expeditions
far
afield
in
spite
of
a
growing
scarcity
of
food
he
could
not
afford
to
risk
the
loss
of
any
more
men
by
pushing
his
sorties
into
the
inland
so
vacani
laffaille
gives
the
incredible
figure
of
meanwhile
reille
at
figueras
was
in
wellnigh
as
forlorn
a
situation
his
communications
with
perpignan
were
open
so
that
he
had
not
like
duhesme
the
fear
of
starvation
before
his
eyes
but
in
other
respects
he
was
almost
as
badly
off
the
were
always
worrying
his
outposts
but
this
was
only
a
secondary
trial
the
main
trouble
was
the
want
of
clothing
transport
and
equipment
the
heterogeneous
mob
of
de
of
swiss
and
tuscan
conscripts
had
been
hurried
to
the
frontier
without
any
proper
preparations
this
mattered
comparatively
little
during
the
summer
but
when
the
autumn
cold
began
reille
found
that
troops
who
had
neither
tents
nor
greatcoats
and
whose
original
summer
uniforms
were
now
worn
out
could
not
keep
the
field
his
ranks
were
so
thinned
by
dysentery
and
rheumatic
affections
that
he
had
to
put
the
men
under
cover
in
figueras
and
the
neighbouring
towns
and
even
to
withdraw
to
perpignan
some
of
his
battalions
whose
clothing
was
absolutely
dropping
to
pieces
his
cavalry
for
want
of
forage
in
the
pyrenees
were
sent
back
into
languedoc
where
occupation
was
found
for
them
by
lord
cochrane
who
was
conducting
a
series
of
daring
raids
on
the
coast
villages
between
the
mouth
of
the
rhone
and
that
of
the
tech
reille
continued
to
solicit
the
war
minister
at
paris
for
clothing
and
transport
but
could
get
nothing
from
him
all
the
resources
of
the
empire
were
being
strained
in
september
and
october
to
fit
out
the
main
army
which
was
about
to
enter
spain
on
the
side
of
biscay
and
napoleon
refused
to
trouble
himself
about
such
a
minor
force
as
the
corps
at
figueras
see
cochrane
s
pp
the
spaniards
therefore
had
in
the
autumn
months
a
unique
opportunity
for
striking
at
the
two
isolated
french
forces
in
catalonia
two
courses
were
open
to
them
they
might
have
turned
their
main
army
against
barcelona
and
attempted
to
besiege
instead
of
merely
to
blockade
duhesme
or
on
the
other
hand
they
might
have
left
a
mere
cordon
of
around
duhesme
and
have
sent
all
their
regulars
to
join
the
levies
of
the
north
and
sweep
reille
across
the
pyrenees
the
resources
at
their
disposition
were
far
from
contemptible
almost
the
whole
garrison
of
the
balearic
isles
having
disembarked
in
catalonia
there
were
now
some
regulars
in
the
principality
and
the
local
junta
had
put
so
much
energy
into
the
equipment
of
the
numerous
of
which
it
had
raised
that
the
larger
half
of
them
at
least
men
were
more
or
less
ready
for
the
field
moreover
they
were
aware
that
large
reinforcements
were
at
hand
reding
s
granadan
division
strong
was
marching
up
from
the
south
and
was
due
to
arrive
early
in
november
the
aragonese
division
under
the
marquis
of
lazan
which
had
been
detached
from
the
army
of
palafox
was
already
at
lerida
valencia
had
sent
up
a
line
regiment
and
the
remains
of
the
division
of
caraffa
from
portugal
were
being
brought
round
by
sea
to
the
mouth
of
the
ebro
altogether
men
of
new
troops
were
on
the
way
to
catalonia
and
the
first
of
them
had
already
come
on
the
scene
two
battalions
of
the
of
savoia
the
old
regiment
of
the
name
had
been
completed
to
four
battalions
two
were
with
castaños
and
called
of
savoia
the
other
two
came
to
catalonia
four
battalions
of
provincial
grenadiers
of
old
and
new
castile
had
already
come
up
unfortunately
the
marquis
del
palacio
the
new
of
catalonia
though
was
slow
and
undecided
to
the
verge
of
absolute
torpidity
beyond
allowing
his
energetic
subordinate
caldagues
to
keep
up
the
blockade
of
barcelona
he
did
practically
nothing
a
couple
of
thousand
of
his
regulars
based
on
gerona
and
rosas
lay
opposite
reille
but
were
far
too
weak
to
attack
him
about
under
caldagues
were
engaged
in
the
operations
around
barcelona
the
rest
the
held
back
and
did
not
use
all
through
september
he
lay
idle
at
tarragona
to
the
great
disgust
of
the
local
junta
who
at
last
sent
such
angry
complaints
to
aranjuez
that
the
central
junta
recalled
him
and
replaced
him
by
vives
the
old
of
the
balearic
islands
who
took
over
the
command
on
october
this
gave
a
change
of
commander
but
not
of
policy
for
vives
was
as
slow
and
incapable
as
his
predecessor
we
have
already
had
occasion
to
mention
the
trouble
that
he
gave
in
august
when
he
refused
to
send
his
troops
to
the
mainland
till
actually
compelled
to
yield
by
their
mutiny
when
he
took
over
the
charge
of
operations
he
found
foot
and
horse
at
his
disposition
and
the
french
still
on
the
defensive
both
at
barcelona
and
at
figueras
he
had
a
splendid
opportunity
and
it
was
not
yet
too
late
to
strike
hard
but
all
that
he
chose
to
attempt
was
to
turn
the
blockade
of
barcelona
into
an
investment
by
tightening
the
cordon
round
the
place
to
lay
siege
to
the
city
does
not
seem
to
have
been
within
the
scope
of
his
intentions
but
on
november
he
moved
up
to
the
line
of
the
llobregat
with
infantry
and
horse
mostly
regulars
he
had
opened
negotiations
with
secret
friends
within
the
walls
and
had
arranged
that
when
the
whole
forces
of
duhesme
were
sufficiently
occupied
in
resisting
the
assault
from
outside
the
populace
should
take
arms
and
endeavour
to
seize
and
throw
open
one
of
the
gates
but
matters
never
got
to
this
point
on
november
several
spanish
columns
moved
in
nearer
to
barcelona
and
began
to
skirmish
with
the
outposts
of
the
garrison
but
the
attack
was
incoherent
and
never
pressed
home
vives
then
waited
till
the
when
he
had
received
more
reinforcements
the
first
brigade
of
reding
s
granadan
division
on
that
day
another
general
assault
on
duhesme
s
outlying
posts
was
delivered
and
this
time
with
considerable
success
several
of
the
suburban
villages
were
carried
over
a
hundred
frenchmen
were
captured
and
the
line
of
blockade
was
drawn
close
under
the
walls
duhesme
had
no
longer
any
hold
outside
the
city
but
barcelona
was
strong
and
its
garrison
when
concentrated
within
the
place
was
just
numerous
enough
to
hold
its
own
duhesme
had
thought
for
a
moment
of
evacuating
the
city
and
retiring
into
the
citadel
and
the
fortress
of
montjuich
but
on
mature
consideration
he
resolved
to
cling
as
long
as
possible
to
the
whole
circuit
of
the
town
he
had
heard
that
an
army
of
relief
was
at
last
on
the
way
and
made
up
his
mind
to
yield
no
inch
without
compulsion
thus
vives
wasted
another
month
without
any
adequate
results
he
had
with
the
whole
field
army
of
catalonia
done
nothing
more
than
turn
the
french
out
of
their
first
and
weakest
line
of
defence
the
fortress
was
intact
and
to
all
intents
and
purposes
might
have
been
observed
as
well
by
as
by
the
large
force
which
vives
had
brought
against
it
meanwhile
the
enemy
utterly
unopposed
on
the
line
of
the
pyrenees
was
getting
together
a
formidable
host
for
the
relief
of
barcelona
when
he
had
recognized
that
reille
s
extemporized
army
was
insufficient
alike
in
quantity
and
in
quality
for
the
task
before
it
the
emperor
had
directed
on
perpignan
as
we
have
already
seen
two
strong
divisions
of
the
army
of
italy
one
composed
of
ten
french
battalions
under
general
souham
the
other
of
thirteen
italian
battalions
the
order
to
dispatch
them
had
only
been
given
on
august
and
the
regiments
which
had
to
be
mobilized
and
equipped
and
then
to
march
up
from
lombardy
to
the
roots
of
the
pyrenees
did
not
begin
to
arrive
at
perpignan
till
september
the
artillery
and
the
troops
which
came
from
the
more
distant
points
only
appeared
on
october
even
then
there
was
a
further
week
s
delay
for
the
emperor
had
monopolized
for
the
main
army
on
the
side
of
the
bidassoa
all
the
available
battalions
of
the
military
train
the
army
of
the
eastern
pyrenees
had
no
transport
save
that
which
the
regiments
had
brought
with
them
and
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
a
few
hundred
mules
and
some
open
carts
were
collected
from
the
french
border
districts
it
was
only
on
november
that
the
army
crossed
the
pyrenees
by
the
great
pass
between
bellegarde
and
la
junquera
vol
the
officer
placed
in
command
was
general
gouvion
cyr
who
afterwards
won
his
marshal
s
bâton
in
the
russian
war
of
he
was
a
general
of
ability
who
had
served
all
through
the
wars
of
the
revolution
with
marked
distinction
but
he
disliked
bonaparte
and
had
not
the
art
to
hide
the
fact
this
had
kept
him
back
from
earlier
promotion
cyr
was
by
no
means
an
amiable
character
he
was
detested
by
his
officers
and
his
troops
as
a
confirmed
grumbler
and
selfish
to
an
incredible
degree
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
can
always
show
admirable
and
convincing
reasons
for
not
helping
their
neighbours
était
un
mauvais
compagnon
de
said
one
of
the
many
colleagues
whom
he
had
left
in
the
lurch
while
playing
his
own
game
from
his
morose
bearing
and
his
dislike
for
company
he
had
got
the
nickname
of
he
was
cautious
and
ready
of
resource
so
that
his
troops
had
full
confidence
in
him
though
he
never
commanded
their
liking
even
from
his
history
of
the
catalonian
war
one
can
gather
the
character
of
the
man
it
is
admirably
lucid
and
illustrated
with
original
documents
spanish
no
less
than
french
in
a
fashion
only
too
rare
among
the
military
books
of
the
soldiers
of
the
empire
but
it
is
not
only
entirely
but
full
of
malevolent
insinuations
concerning
napoleon
and
the
author
s
colleagues
in
his
first
chapter
he
broaches
the
extraordinary
theory
that
napoleon
handed
over
to
him
the
catalonian
army
without
resources
money
or
transport
in
order
that
he
might
make
a
fiasco
of
the
campaign
and
ruin
his
reputation
he
actually
seems
to
have
believed
that
his
master
disliked
to
have
battles
won
for
him
by
officers
who
had
not
owed
to
him
the
beginning
of
their
fortunes
and
would
have
been
rather
pleased
than
otherwise
to
see
the
attempt
to
relieve
barcelona
end
in
a
failure
for
several
curious
and
interesting
stories
concerning

the
reader
may
search
the
third
volume
of
marbot
s
marbot
is
not
an
authority
to
be
followed
with
much
confidence
but
the
picture
drawn
of
the
marshal
is
borne
out
by
other
and
better
writers
on

de
these
are
of
course
the
vain
imaginings
of
a
jealous
and
suspicious
hypochondriac
it
is
true
that
napoleon
disliked
cyr
but
he
did
not
want
to
see
the
campaign
of
catalonia
end
in
a
disaster
he
gave
the
new
general
a
fine
french
division
of
veteran
troops
and
as
his
letter
to
the
viceroy
eugène
beauharnais
shows
the
picked
regiments
of
the
whole
italian
army
the
seventh
corps
mustered
in
all
more
than
men
and
of
these
were
concentrated
under
cyr
s
hand
at
perpignan
and
figueras
it
is
certain
that
the
troops
were
not
well
equipped
and
that
the
auxiliary
services
were
ill
represented
but
this
was
not
from
exceptional
malice
on
napoleon
s
part
he
was
always
rather
inclined
to
starve
an
army
with
which
he
was
not
present
in
person
and
at
this
moment
every
resource
was
being
strained
to
fit
out
the
main
force
which
were
to
deliver
the
great
blow
at
madrid
catalonia
was
but
a
side
show
and
when
cyr
tries
to
prove
that
it
was
the
most
important
theatre
of
war
in
the
whole
peninsula
he
is
but
exaggerating
after
the
common
fashion
of
poor
humanity
the
greatness
of
his
own
task
and
his
own
victories
cyr
before
starting
from
perpignan
cyr
refitted
as
best
he
could
the
dilapidated
battalions
of
reille
which
were
he
says
in
such
a
state
of
nudity
that
those
who
had
been
sent
back
within
the
french
border
had
to
be
kept
out
of
public
view
from
motives
of
mere
decency
the
whole
division
had
suffered
so
much
from
exposure
that
instead
of
taking
the
field
with
the
men
which
it
possessed
in
august
it
could
present
only
in
november
after
setting
aside
a
battalion
to
garrison
figueras
for
composition
see
the
table
of
the
corps
in
appendix
of

the
figures
given
by

are
pino
souham
chabot
reille
the
last
is
an
understatement
as
shown
by
the
morning
state
of
reille
s
division
in
relmas
ii
which
shows
excluding
the
garrison
of
figueras
more
than
strong
but
though
reille
was
weak
and
the
division
of
chabot
a
mere
corps
of
two
neapolitan
battalions
and
one
regiment
of
national
guards
was
an
almost
negligible
quantity
the
troops
newly
arrived
from
italy
were
both
numerous
and
good
in
quality
souham

ten
french

and

but
only
the
troops
available
for
operations
within

on
his
way
to
perpignan
cyr
had
visited
the
emperor
at
paris
so
as
to
receive
his
orders
in
person
napoleon
informed
him
that
he
left
him
as
to
all
details
the
one
thing
on
which
he
insisted
was
that
barcelona
must
be
preserved
si
vous
perdiez
cette
place
je
ne
la
reprendrais
pas
avec
mille
this
then
was
to
be
the
main
object
of
the
coming
campaign
there
were
about
two
months
available
for
the
task
for
duhesme
reported
that
though
food
was
growing
scarce
he
could
hold
out
till
the
end
of
december
to
lessen
the
number
of
idle
mouths
in
barcelona
he
had
been
giving
permits
to
depart
to
many
of
the
inhabitants
and
expelling
others
against
whom
he
could
find
excuses
for
severity
the
from
figueras
to
barcelona
was
blocked
by
the
fortress
of
gerona
whose
previous
resistance
in
july
and
august
showed
that
its
capture
would
be
a
tedious
and
difficult
matter
cyr
calculated
that
he
had
not
the
time
to
spare
for
the
siege
of
this
place
long
ere
he
could
expect
to
take
it
duhesme
would
be
starved
out
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
have
to
march
past
gerona
and
as
the
is
commanded
by
the
guns
of
the
city
he
would
be
forced
to
take
with
him
no
heavy
guns
or
baggage
but
only
light
artillery
and
which
could
use
the
of
the
mountains
it
was
his
first
duty
to
relieve
barcelona
by
defeating
the
main
army
of
vives
when
this
had
been
done
it
would
be
time
enough
to
think
of
the
siege
of
gerona
but
there
was
another
fortress
which
cyr
resolved
to
clear
out
of
his
way
before
starting
to
aid
duhesme
on
the
only
ten
miles
before
figueras
lies
the
little
town
of
rosas
which
blocks
the
route
that
crawls
under
the
cliffs
from
perpignan
and
to
the
ampurdam
the
moment
that
the
french
army
advanced
south
from
figueras
it
would
have
rosas
on
its
flank
and
even
small
expeditions
based
on
the
place
could
make
certain
of
cutting
the
and
intercepting
all
communications
between
the
base
and
the
field
force
that
had
gone
forward
but
it
was
more
than
likely
that
the
spaniards
would
land
a
considerable
body
of
troops
in
rosas
for
it
has
an
excellent
harbour
and
every
facility
for
disembarkation
several
english
were
lying
there
it
served
them
as
their
shelter
and
port
of
call
while
they
watched
for
the
french
ships
which
tried
to
run
into
barcelona
with
provisions
from
marseilles
cette
or
already
they
had
captured
many
vessels
which
endeavoured
to
pierce
the
blockade
cyr
therefore
was
strongly
of
opinion
that
he
ought
to
make
an
end
of
the
garrison
of
rosas
before
starting
on
his
expedition
to
aid
duhesme
the
place
was
strategically
important
but
its
fortifications
were
in
such
bad
order
that
he
imagined
that
it
might
be
reduced
in
a
few
days
the
town
which
counted
no
more
than
souls
consisted
of
a
single
long
street
running
along
the
shore
it
was
covered
by
nothing
more
than
a
ditch
and
an
earthwork
resting
at
one
end
on
a
weak
redoubt
above
the
beach
and
at
the
other
upon
the
citadel
the
latter
formed
the
strength
of
the
place
it
was
a
pentagonal
work
regularly
constructed
with
bastions
and
a
scarp
and
counterscarp
reveted
with
stone
but
its
resisting
power
was
seriously
diminished
by
the
fact
that
the
great
breach
which
the
french
had
made
during
its
last
siege
in
had
never
been
properly
repaired
the
government
of
godoy
had
neglected
the
place
and
when
the
insurrection
began
the
catalans
had
found
it
still
in
ruins
and
had
merely
built
up
the
gap
with
loose
stones
and
barrels
filled
with
earth
a
good
battering
train
would
bring
down
the
whole
of
these
futile
patchings
in
a
few
days
a
mile
to
the
right
of
the
citadel
was
a
detached
work
the
fort
of
the
trinity
placed
above
a
rocky
promontory
which
forms
the
horn
of
the
harbour
it
had
been
built
to
protect
ships
lying
before
the
place
from
being
annoyed
by
besiegers
the
trinity
was
built
in
an
odd
and
ingenious
fashion
it
was
commanded
at
the
distance
of
only
yards
by
the
rocky
hill
of
to
prevent
ill
effects
from
a
plunging
fire
from
this
elevation
its
front
had
been
raised
to
a
great
height
so
as
to
protect
the
interior
of
the
work
from
molestation
a
broad
tower
feet
high
covered
the
whole
side
of
the
castle
which
faces
inland
nothing
in
short
for
a
fortress
commanded
by
adjacent
heights
could
have
been
better
adapted
for
holding
out
against
offensive
operations
or
worse
adapted
for
replying
to
them
the
french
battery
on
the
cliff
was
too
elevated
for
artillery
to
reach
while
the
tower
which
prevented
their
shot
from
reaching
the
body
of
the
fort
also
prevented
any
return
fire
at
them
even
if
the
fort
had
possessed
artillery
in
consequence
of
the
elevated
position
of
the
french
on
the
cliff
they
could
only
breach
the
central
portion
of
the
tower
the
lowest
part
of
the
breach
they
made
was
nearly
sixty
feet
above
its
base
so
that
it
could
only
be
reached
by
long
scaling
ladders
it
is
seldom
that
a
besieger
has
to
complain
of
the
difficulty
caused
to
him
by
the
possession
of
ground
completely
dominating
a
place
that
he
has
to
reduce
but
in
the
course
of
the
siege
of
fort
trinity
the
french
were
undoubtedly
incommoded
by
the
height
of
the
the
garrison
below
hidden
in
good
and
covered
by
the
tower
suffered
little
harm
from
their
fire
to
batter
the
whole
tower
to
pieces
by
a
downward
fire
was
too
long
and
serious
a
business
for
them
they
merely
tried
to
breach
it
lord
cochrane
s
i
he
adds
a
pretty
correct
idea
of
our
relative
positions
may
be
formed
if
the
unnautical
reader
will
imagine
our
small
force
placed
in
the
nave
of
westminster
abbey
with
the
enemy
attacking
the
great
western
tower
from
the
summit
of
a
cliff
feet
higher
than
the
tower
so
that
the
breach
in
course
of
formation
corresponds
to
the
great
west
window
of
the
abbey
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
them
to
scale
the
external
wall
of
the
tower
up
to
the
great
window
and
more
difficult
still
to
get
down
from
the
window
into
the
body
of
the
church
these
were
the
points
i
had
to
provide
against
for
we
could
not
prevent
the
french
either
from
breaching
or
from
if
the
ground
in
front
of
fort
trinity
was
too
high
for
the
french
that
of
the
town
of
rosas
was
too
low
it
was
so
marshy
that
in
wet
weather
the
ditches
of
their
siege
works
filled
at
once
with
water
and
their
parapets
crumbled
into
liquid
mud
the
only
approach
on
ground
of
convenient
firmness
and
elevation
was
opposite
a
comparatively
narrow
front
of
the
corner
of
the
place
the
garrison
of
rosas
when
cyr
undertook
its
siege
was
commanded
by
colonel
peter
o
daly
an
officer
of
the
ultonia
who
had
distinguished
himself
at
gerona
it
was
composed
of
a
skeleton
battalion
men
of
the
governor
s
own
irish
corps
of
half
the
light
infantry
regiment
of
barcelona
of
a
company
of
wimpffen
s
swiss
regiment
and
gunners
these
were
regulars
of
new
levies
there
were
the
two
of
lerida
and
igualada
with
some
companies
of
those
of
berga
and
figueras
the
whole
force
was
exactly
strong
it
would
be
wrong
to
omit
the
mention
of
the
british
succours
which
took
part
in
the
defence
there
lay
in
the
harbour
the
and
two
when
the
departed
on
november
she
was
replaced
by
the
another
ship
and
during
the
last
days
of
the
siege
lord
cochrane
in
his
frigate
the
was
also
present
it
is
well
to
remember
their
exact
force
for
the
french
narrators
of
the
leaguer
of
rosas
are
prone
to
call
them
the
british
squadron
a
term
which
seems
rather
too
magnificent
to
apply
to
a
group
of
vessels
never
numbering
more
than
one
ship
one
frigate
and
two
cyr
moved
forward
on
november
with
the
four
divisions
of
souham
pino
reille
and
chabot
which
as
we
have
seen
amounted
in
all
to
about
men
he
had
resolved
to
use
pino
and
reille
some
men
for
the
actual
siege
and
souham
and
chabot
for
the
covering
work
accordingly
the
weak
division
of
the
officer
was
left
to
watch
the
ground
at
the
foot
of
the
passes
in
the
direction
of
figueras
and
la
junquera
while
souham
took
up
the
line
of
the
river
fluvia
which
lay
across
the
path
of
any
relieving
force
that
might
come
from
the
direction
of
gerona
cyr
remained
with
the
covering
army
and
gave
the
conduct
of
the
siege
to
reille
perhaps
because
he
had
already
made
one
attack
on
the
town
in
august
on
november
reille
marched
down
to
the
sea
driving
before
him
the
spanish
outlying
pickets
and
the
peasantry
of
the
suburban
villages
who
took
refuge
with
their
cattle
in
rosas
on
the
seventh
the
investment
began
reille
s
own
division
taking
its
position
on
the
marshy
ground
opposite
the
town
while
pino
encamped
more
to
the
left
upon
the
heights
that
face
the
fort
of
the
trinity
the
head
quarters
were
established
at
the
village
of
palau
a
battalion
of
the
italian
light
infantry
was
placed
far
back
to
the
to
keep
off
the
of
the
coast
villages
about
llanza
and
selva
de
mar
from
interfering
in
the
siege
next
day
the
civil
population
of
rosas
embarked
on
and
small
merchantmen
and
departed
to
the
south
abandoning
the
whole
town
to
the
garrison
they
just
missed
seeing
some
sharp
fighting
the
covering
party
who
had
been
detached
to
the
neighbourhood
of
llanza
were
beset
during
a
dense
mist
by
the
of
the
coast
two
companies
were
cut
to
pieces
or
captured
the
rest
were
saved
by
general
fontane
who
led
out
three
battalions
from
pino
s
lines
to
their
assistance
while
this
engagement
was
in
progress
the
garrison
sallied
out
with
men
to
beat
up
the
main
camp
of
the
italians
they
were
repulsed
after
a
sharp
fight
the
majority
got
back
to
the
citadel
but
one
party
being
surrounded
captain
west
of
the
landed
with
of
his
seamen
and
marines
cut
his
way
to
them
and
brought
them
off
in
safety
west
had
his
horse
shot
under
him
a
curious
note
to
have
to
make
concerning
a
naval
officer
and
lost
ten
men
wounded
after
the
eighth
there
followed
seven
days
of
continuous
rain
which
turned
the
camp
of
reille
s
division
into
a
marsh
and
effectually
prevented
the
construction
of
siege
works
in
the
ground
opposite
to
the
town
the
only
active
operation
that
could
be
undertaken
was
an
attempt
to
storm
the
fort
of
the
trinity
which
the
french
believed
to
be
in
far
worse
condition
than
was
actually
the
case
it
was
held
by
eighty
spaniards
under
the
irish
fitzgerald
and
of
the
marines
the
six
voltigeur
and
grenadier
companies
of
the
italian
light
infantry
delivered
the
assault
with
great
dash
and
resolution
but
as
the
strong
frontal
tower
of
the
fort
was
high
and
unbreached
they
could
make
no
impression
their
ladders
proved
useless
and
they
were
repulsed
with
a
loss
of
sixty
men
their
leader
the
lange
and
several
other
officers
were
left
dead
at
the
foot
of
the
walls
james
s
seeing
that
nothing
was
to
be
won
by
mere
escalade
reille
had
to
wait
for
his
siege
artillery
which
began
to
arrive
from
perpignan
on
november
he
at
once
started
two
batteries
on
the
to
breach
the
fort
of
the
trinity
and
when
the
ground
had
begun
to
grow
dry
in
front
of
the
town
opened
trenches
opposite
its
angle
when
a
good
had
been
found
a
battery
was
established
which
played
upon
the
citadel
and
commanded
so
much
of
the
harbour
that
reille
hoped
that
the
british
ships
would
be
compelled
to
shift
their
anchorage
further
out
to
sea
the
spaniards
and
the
replied
with
such
a
heavy
fire
that
in
a
few
hours
the
battery
was
silenced
after
its
powder
magazine
had
been
exploded
by
a
lucky
shell
november
next
day
however
the
french
repaired
the
damage
and
mounted
more
guns
whose
fire
proved
so
damaging
that
captain
west
had
to
move
further
from
the
shore
the
assailants
had
established
a
marked
superiority
over
the
fire
of
the
besieged
and
availed
themselves
of
it
by
pushing
out
parallels
nearer
to
the
town
and
building
four
more
breaching
batteries
with
these
additional
resources
they
began
to
work
serious
damage
in
the
unstable
bastions
of
the
citadel
they
also
knocked
a
hole
in
the
fort
of
the
trinity
but
the
breach
was
so
far
from
the
foot
of
the
wall
that
it
was
still
almost
inaccessible
the
heaps
of
rubbish
which
fell
into
the
ditch
did
not
even
reach
the
lowest
part
of
the
gap
on
the
the
was
relieved
by
the
and
captain
west
handed
over
the
task
of
with
the
spaniards
to
captain
bennett
the
latter
thought
so
ill
of
the
state
of
affairs
that
after
two
days
he
withdrew
his
marines
from
the
trinity
fort
an
action
most
discouraging
to
the
spaniards
but
at
this
juncture
there
arrived
in
the
bay
the
frigate
with
her
indefatigable
commandant
lord
cochrane
a
host
in
himself
for
such
a
desperate
enterprise
as
the
defence
of
the
town
he
got
leave
from
his
superior
officer
to
continue
the
defence
and
manned
the
trinity
again
with
his
own
seamen
and
marines
they
had
hardly
established
themselves
there
when
the
italian
brigade
of
mazzuchelli
made
a
second
attempt
to
storm
the
fort
but
it
was
repulsed
without
even
having
reached
the
foot
of
the
breach
cochrane
seeing
that
the
battery
which
was
playing
on
the
trinity
was
on
the
very
edge
of
a
precipitous
cliff
resolved
to
try
whether
it
would
not
be
possible
to
surprise
it
at
night
by
landing
troops
on
the
beach
at
the
back
of
the
if
they
could
get
possession
of
the
guns
for
a
few
minutes
he
hoped
to
cast
them
over
the
declivity
on
to
the
rocks
below
o
daly
lent
him
from
the
garrison
of
the
town
and
this
force
was
put
ashore
with
thirty
of
the
marines
who
were
to
lead
the
assault
the
italians
however
were
not
caught
sleeping
the
attack
failed
and
the
assailants
were
beaten
back
to
the
rocks
by
the
beach
with
the
loss
of
ten
killed
and
twenty
wounded
beside
prisoners
the
boats
of
the
frigate
only
brought
off
men
but
many
more
escaped
along
the
beach
into
the
hilly
country
to
the
east
and
were
neither
captured
nor
slain
november
the
sortie
however
had
been
disastrous
and
the
governor
o
daly
was
so
at
the
loss
of
men
and
at
the
way
in
which
the
walls
of
the
citadel
were
crumbling
before
his
eyes
that
he
began
to
think
of
surrender
nor
was
he
much
to
blame
for
the
state
of
things
was
so
bad
that
it
was
evident
that
unless
some
new
factor
was
introduced
into
the
siege
the
end
was
not
far
off
the
utter
improbability
of
relief
from
without
was
demonstrated
on
the
julian
alvarez
the
governor
of
gerona
and
commander
of
the
spanish
forces
in
the
ampurdam
was
perfectly
well
aware
that
it
was
his
duty
to
do
what
he
could
for
the
succour
of
rosas
but
his
forces
were
insignificant
vives
had
only
given
him
regular
troops
to
watch
the
whole
line
of
the
eastern
pyrenees
and
of
this
small
force
half
was
shut
up
in
rosas
nevertheless
alvarez
sallied
out
from
gerona
with
two
weak
battalions
of
ultonia
and
borbon
and
half
of
the
light
infantry
regiment
of
barcelona
picking
up
local
he
advanced
to
the
line
of
the
fluvia
where
souham
was
lying
with
the
division
that
cyr
had
told
off
to
cover
the
siege
the
spaniards
drove
in
the
french
outposts
at
several
points
but
immediately
found
themselves
opposed
by
very
superior
numbers
and
brought
to
a
complete
stand
realizing
that
he
was
far
too
weak
to
do
anything
alvarez
retreated
to
gerona
after
a
sharp
skirmish
if
he
had
pushed
on
he
would
infallibly
have
been
destroyed
o
daly
received
prompt
news
of
his
colleague
s
discomfiture
and
saw
that
relief
was
impossible
the
fact
was
that
vives
ought
to
have
brought
up
from
barcelona
his
whole
field
army
of
men
with
such
a
host
souham
could
have
been
driven
back
and
reille
compelled
to
relax
the
investment
perhaps
even
to
raise
the
siege
but
the
preferred
to
waste
his
men
and
his
time
in
the
futile
blockade
of
duhesme
who
could
have
been
just
as
well
contained
by
as
by
the
main
spanish
army
of
catalonia
the
only
attempt
which
vives
made
to
strengthen
his
force
in
the
ampurdam
was
to
order
up
to
gerona
the
aragonese
division
of
men
under
the
marquis
of
lazan
which
was
lying
at
lerida
this
force
arrived
too
late
for
the
skirmish
on
the
fluvia
and
when
it
did
appear
was
far
too
small
to
accomplish
anything
alvarez
and
lazan
united
had
only
bayonets
while
cyr
s
whole
army
as
we
have
already
seen
was
strong
and
quite
able
to
maintain
the
siege
and
at
the
same
time
to
provide
a
covering
force
against
a
relieving
army
so
weak
as
that
which
now
lay
at
gerona
compare
the
narrative
of
lord
cochrane
i
with
those
of
belmas
ii
and
cyr
the
latter
is
of
course
wrong
in
saying
that
the
whole
sortie
was
composed
of
british
seamen
and
marines
it
is
curious
that
cochrane
states
his
own
loss
at
more
than
the
french
claimed
to
have
killed
or
taken
the
siege
operations
meanwhile
were
pushed
on
fresh
batteries
were
established
to
sweep
the
harbour
and
to
render
more
difficult
the
communication
of
the
citadel
and
the
trinity
fort
with
the
english
ships
a
new
attack
was
started
against
the
eastern
front
of
the
town
and
measures
were
taken
to
concentrate
a
heavier
fire
on
the
dilapidated
bastion
of
the
citadel
which
had
been
destroyed
in
the
old
siege
of
and
never
properly
repaired
on
the
an
assault
was
directed
by
pino
s
division
against
the
town
front
this
was
defended
by
no
more
than
a
ditch
and
earthwork
the
italians
carried
it
at
the
first
rush
but
found
more
difficulty
in
evicting
the
garrison
from
the
ruined
houses
along
the
shore
five
hundred
who
were
barricaded
among
them
made
a
very
obstinate
resistance
and
were
only
driven
out
after
sharp
fighting
one
hundred
and
sixty
were
taken
prisoners
less
than
a
hundred
escaped
into
the
citadel
the
rest
perished
the
besiegers
at
once
established
a
lodgement
in
the
town
covering
themselves
with
the
masonry
of
the
demolished
houses
it
was
in
vain
that
the
and
ran
close
in
shore
and
tried
to
batter
the
italians
out
of
the
ruins
they
inflicted
considerable
loss
but
failed
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
finding
shelter
next
night
the
lodgement
in
the
town
was
connected
with
the
rest
of
the
siege
works
and
used
as
the
base
for
an
attack
against
a
hitherto
unmolested
front
of
the
citadel
just
after
the
storming
of
the
town
the
garrison
received
the
only
succour
which
was
sent
to
it
during
the
whole
siege
a
weak
battalion
of
regulars
from
the
regiment
of
borbon
was
put
ashore
near
the
citadel
under
cover
of
the
darkness
it
would
have
been
more
useful
on
the
preceding
day
for
the
defence
of
the
outer
works
after
the
arrival
of
this
small
succour
the
governor
o
daly
sent
eighty
men
of
the
irish
regiment
of
ultonia
to
reinforce
cochrane
in
the
trinity
fort
withdrawing
a
similar
number
of
to
the
citadel
the
guns
established
by
the
besiegers
in
their
new
batteries
among
the
ruins
of
the
town
made
such
good
practice
upon
the
front
of
the
citadel
that
reille
thought
it
worth
while
on
the
to
summon
the
governor
to
surrender
o
daly
made
a
becoming
answer
to
the
effect
that
his
defences
were
still
intact
and
that
he
was
prepared
to
continue
his
resistance
to
cut
him
off
from
his
communication
with
the
sea
the
only
side
from
which
he
could
expect
help
reille
now
began
to
build
batteries
along
the
of
the
town
which
commanded
the
below
the
citadel
the
english
ships
proved
unable
to
subdue
these
new
guns
and
their
power
to
help
o
daly
was
seriously
diminished
it
was
only
under
cover
of
the
darkness
that
they
could
send
boats
to
land
men
or
stores
for
the
citadel
on
the
thirtieth
they
tried
to
take
off
the
sick
and
wounded
who
were
now
growing
very
numerous
in
the
place
but
the
having
hit
the
headmost
boat
the
rest
drew
off
and
abandoned
the
attempt
the
prospects
of
the
garrison
had
grown
most
gloomy
meanwhile
the
trinity
fort
had
been
perpetually
battered
for
ten
days
and
the
hole
in
the
great
frontal
tower
was
growing
larger
it
can
hardly
be
called
a
breach
as
owing
to
the
impossibility
of
searching
the
lower
courses
of
the
wall
by
the
plunging
fire
from
the
the
lowest
edge
of
the
gap
was
forty
feet
from
the
ground
the
part
of
the
tower
which
had
been
opened
was
the
upper
section
of
a
lofty
casemate
which
composed
its
ground
story
lord
cochrane
built
up
with
the
débris
that
fell
inwards
and
with
hammocks
filled
with
earth
and
sand
new
walls
inside
the
bomb
proof
cutting
off
the
hole
from
the
interior
of
the
tower
thus
enemies
entering
at
the
gap
would
find
that
they
had
only
penetrated
into
the
upper
part
of
a
sort
of
cellar
the
ingenious
captain
also
set
a
long
slide
or
shoot
of
greased
planks
just
under
the
lip
of
the
hole
so
that
any
one
stepping
in
would
be
precipitated
thirty
feet
into
the
bottom
of
the
casemate
but
the
mere
sight
of
this
mantrap
as
he
called
it
proved
enough
for
the
enemy
who
never
pushed
the
attack
into
it
on
november
pino
s
division
assaulted
the
fort
the
storming
party
being
composed
of
six
grenadier
and
voltigeur
companies
of
the
and
italian
regiments
they
came
on
with
great
courage
and
planted
their
ladders
below
the
great
hole
amid
a
heavy
fire
of
musketry
from
the
garrison
the
leaders
succeeded
in
reaching
the
edge
of
the
breach
but
finding
the
chasm
and
the
mantrap
before
them
would
not
enter
they
were
all
shot
down
grenades
were
dropped
in
profusion
into
the
mass
at
the
foot
of
the
ladders
and
after
a
time
the
stormers
fled
back
under
cover
leaving
two
officers
and
forty
men
behind
them
they
were
rallied
and
brought
up
again
to
the
foot
of
the
breach
but
recoiled
after
a
second
and
less
desperate
attempt
to
enter
the
garrison
lost
only
three
men
killed
and
two
wounded
of
whom
four
were
spaniards
they
captured
two
prisoners
men
who
had
got
so
far
forward
that
they
dared
not
go
back
under
the
terrible
fire
which
swept
the
foot
of
the
tower
these
unfortunates
had
to
be
taken
into
the
fort
by
a
rope
so
inaccessible
was
the
supposed
breach
after
this
bloody
repulse
the
besiegers
left
lord
cochrane
alone
merely
continuing
to
bombard
his
tower
and
throwing
up
entrenchments
on
the
beach
from
which
they
kept
up
an
incessant
musketry
fire
on
the
difficult
by
which
the
fort
communicated
with
the
ships
illustration
battle

siege
of

to
their
main
attention
was
now
turned
to
the
citadel
where
o
daly
s
position
was
growing
hopeless
their
practice
says
cochrane
was
beautiful
so
accurately
was
their
artillery
conducted
that
every
discharge
ruled
a
straight
line
along
the
lower
part
of
the
walls
this
being
repeated
till
the
upper
portion
was
without
support
as
a
matter
of
course
the
whole
fell
into
the
ditch
forming
a
breach
of
easy
ascent
the
whole
proceedings
were
clearly
visible
from
the
trinity
on
december
the
governor
played
his
last
card
the
worst
of
the
damage
was
being
done
by
the
advanced
batteries
placed
among
the
ruins
of
the
town
and
it
was
from
this
point
that
the
impending
assault
would
evidently
be
delivered
o
daly
therefore
picked
of
his
best
men
opened
a
postern
gate
and
launched
them
at
night
upon
the
besiegers
works
the
sortie
was
delivered
with
great
dash
and
vigour
the
trench
guards
were
swept
away
the
breaching
batteries
were
seized
and
the
spaniards
began
to
throw
down
the
parapets
spike
the
guns
and
set
fire
to
the
platforms
and
fascines
but
heavy
reserves
came
up
from
the
french
camp
and
their
attack
could
not
be
resisted
before
any
very
serious
damage
had
been
done
the
besieged
were
driven
out
of
the
trenches
by
sheer
force
of
numbers
and
forced
to
retire
to
the
citadel
leaving
dead
behind
them
reille
acknowledged
the
loss
of
one
officer
and
twelve
men
killed
and
nineteen
men
wounded
cochrane
i
on
the
fourth
the
siege
works
were
pushed
forward
to
within
yards
of
the
walls
of
the
citadel
and
the
breach
already
established
in
the
dilapidated
bastion
was
enlarged
to
a
great
breadth
after
dark
the
french
engineers
got
forward
as
far
as
the
counterscarp
and
reported
that
an
assault
was
practicable
and
could
hardly
fail
the
same
fact
was
perfectly
evident
to
o
daly
who
sent
out
a
to
ask
for
terms
he
offered
to
surrender
in
return
for
leave
to
take
his
garrison
off
by
sea
reille
naturally
refused
as
the
spaniards
were
at
his
mercy
and
enforced
an
unconditional
surrender
the
state
of
things
being
visible
to
lord
cochrane
on
the
next
morning
he
hastily
evacuated
the
trinity
fort
which
it
was
useless
to
hold
after
the
citadel
had
fallen
his
garrison
spaniards
and
eighty
british
sailors
and
marines
had
to
descend
from
the
fort
by
rope
ladders
as
the
enemy
commanded
the
proper
point
of
embarkation
they
were
taken
off
by
the
boats
of
the
and
under
a
heavy
musketry
fire
but
suffered
no
appreciable
loss
the
magazine
was
left
with
a
slow
match
burning
and
exploded
ruining
the
fort
before
the
garrison
had
got
on
board
their
ships
cyr
in
his
journal
of
the
war
in
catalonia
suggests
that
bennett
and
cochrane
ought
to
have
tried
to
take
off
the
garrison
of
the
citadel
in
the
same
fashion
but
this
was
practically
impossible
the
communication
between
the
citadel
and
the
sea
had
been
lost
for
some
days
the
french
batteries
along
the
beach
rendering
the
approach
of
boats
too
dangerous
to
be
attempted
if
captain
bennett
had
sent
in
the
limited
supply
of
boats
that
the
the
and
the
two
smaller
vessels
possessed
they
would
probably
have
been
destroyed
for
they
would
have
had
to
make
many
return
journeys
in
order
to
remove
men
under
the
fire
of
heavy
guns
placed
only
or
yards
away
from
the
it
was
quite
another
thing
to
remove
men
from
the
trinity
where
the
enemy
could
bring
practically
nothing
but
musketry
to
bear
and
where
the
whole
of
the
garrison
could
be
taken
off
at
a
single
trip
another
futile
charge
made
by
the
french
against
the
british
navy
is
that
the
shelled
the
beach
near
the
citadel
while
the
captive
garrison
was
marching
out
and
killed
several
of
the
unfortunate
spaniards
if
the
incident
happened
at
all
there
is
no
mention
of
it
in
lord
cochrane
or
in
james
it
must
have
been
due
to
an
attempt
to
damage
the
french
trenches
captain
bennett
could
not
have
known
that
the
passing
column
consisted
of
spaniards
to
insinuate
that
the
mistake
was
deliberate
as
does
belmas
is
simply
malicious
these
were
the
two
and
the
came
up
the
same
day
but
after
the
evacuation
of
the
trinity
cyr
does
not
say
so
but
only
that
the
spaniards
imagined
that
it
was
done
deliberately
belmas
ii
asks
if
it
was
not
irritation
on
the
part
of
the
british
arteche
does
not
repulse
the
silly
suggestion
as
he
reasonably
might
iv
o
daly
went
into
captivity
with
men
leaving
about
more
in
hospital
the
total
of
the
troops
who
had
taken
part
in
the
defence
including
the
reinforcements
received
by
sea
had
been
about
so
that
about
must
have
perished
in
the
siege
the
french
loss
had
been
at
least
as
great
pino
s
division
alone
lost
thirty
officers
and
men
killed
and
wounded
besides
many
sick
it
is
probable
that
the
total
diminution
in
the
ranks
of
reille
s
two
divisions
was
over
the
bad
weather
having
told
very
heavily
on
the
troops
belmas
ii
and
vacani
ii
agree
in
these
figures
so
ended
an
honourable
if
not
a
very
desperate
defence
the
place
was
doomed
from
the
first
when
once
the
torpid
and
purblind
vives
had
made
up
his
mind
to
keep
his
whole
force
concentrated
round
barcelona
and
to
send
no
more
than
the
insignificant
division
of
alvarez
and
lazan
to
the
help
of
o
daly
considering
the
dilapidated
condition
of
the
citadel
of
rosas
and
the
almost
untenable
state
of
the
town
section
of
the
fortifications
the
only
wonder
is
that
the
french
did
not
break
in
at
an
earlier
date
the
first
approaches
of
reille
s
engineers
were
according
to
belmas
unskilfully
conducted
and
pushed
too
much
into
the
marsh
when
once
they
received
a
right
direction
the
result
was
inevitable
even
had
the
artillery
failed
to
do
its
work
rosas
must
nevertheless
have
fallen
within
a
few
days
for
it
was
insufficiently
provisioned
and
as
the
communication
with
the
sea
had
been
cut
off
since
november
must
have
yielded
ere
long
to
starvation
the
french
found
an
ample
store
of
guns
pieces
and
much
ammunition
in
the
place
but
an
utterly
inadequate
supply
of
food
belmas
cyr
and
arteche
have
all
numerous
slips
in
their
narration
from
not
having
used
the
british
authorities
vacani
s
account
is
on
the
whole
the
best
on
the
french
side
much
may
be
learnt
from
james
s
vol
v
but
more
from
lord
cochrane
s
picturesque
autobiography
from
this
alone
can
it
be
ascertained
that
the
column
which
attacked
the
on
november
was
composed
of
not
of
british

when

cyr
was
at

able
to
take
in

the
main
operation
which
had
been
entrusted
to
him
by
napoleon
the
relief
of
barcelona
while
the
siege
was
still
in
progress
he
had
received
two
letters
bidding
him
hasten
to
the
relief
of
duhesme
without
delay
but
he
had
taken
upon
himself
the
responsibility
of
writing
back
that
he
must
clear
his
flank
and
rear
before
he
dared
move
and
that
he
should
proceed
with
the
leaguer
of
rosas
which
could
only
last
a
few
days
longer
unless
he
received
formal
orders
to
abandon
the
undertaking
he
ventured
to
point
out
that
the
moral
and
political
effects
of
taking
such
a
step
would
be
deplorable
napoleon
s
silence
gave
consent
and
cyr
s
plea
was
justified
by
the

much
to

effect
from
coubo
wrongly
printed
in
cyr
cyr
to
the
emperor
from
figueras
rosas
having
been
captured
the
french
general
had
now
at
his
disposition
all
his
four
divisions
those
of
souham
pino
reille
and
chabot
which
even
after
deducting
the
casualties
suffered
in
the
siege
and
the
losses
experienced
by
the
covering
troops
from
the
bad
weather
still
amounted
to
men
after
counting
up
the
very
considerable
forces
which
the
spaniards
might
place
in
his
way
he
resolved
to
take
on
with
him
for
the
relief
of
barcelona
the
troops
of
souham
pino
and
chabot
and
to
leave
behind
only
those
of
reille
with
about
or
soldiers
of
not
very
good
quality
that
officer
was
to
hold
figueras
and
rosas
watch
gerona
and
protect
the
to
perpignan
cyr
himself
with
the
battalions
and
nine
squadrons
forming
the
other
three
divisions
a
force
of
some
infantry
and
horse
took
his
way
to
the
south
the
first
obstacle
in
his
way
was
gerona
but
if
he
stopped
to
besiege
and
take
it
it
was
clear
that
he
would
never
reach
barcelona
in
time
to
save
duhesme
from
starvation
that
general
had
reported
that
his
food
would
only
last
till
the
end
of
december
and
gerona
would
certainly
hold
out
more
than
three
weeks
indeed
as
we
shall
see
when
it
was
actually
beleaguered
in
the
next
year
it
made
a
desperate
defence
lasting
for
nearly
six
months
cyr
saw
from
the
first
that
he
must
leave
the
fortress
alone
and
slip
past
it
as
it
commanded
the
this
resolution
forced
him
to
abandon
any
intention
of
taking
forward
his
artillery
and
his
wheeled
transport
they
could
not
face
the
rugged
on
to
which
he
would
be
compelled
to
throw
himself
and
he
marched
without
a
single
gun
and
with
his
food
and
provisions
borne
on
and
mules
of
which
he
had
a
very
modest
provision
may
to
cyr
was
quite
well
aware
that
if
general
vives
were
to
resign
the
blockade
of
barcelona
to
his
and
and
to
come
against
him
with
his
whole
army
the
task
of
relieving
duhesme
would
be
dangerous
if
not
impossible
there
are
but
two
roads
from
gerona
to
barcelona
and
across
each
of
them
lie
half
a
dozen
positions
which
if
entrenched
and
held
by
superior
numbers
he
could
not
hope
to
force
these
two
routes
are
the
by
mataro
and
arens
de
mar
which
the
french
had
used
for
their
first
march
to
gerona
in
august
and
the
inland
road
up
the
valley
of
the
besos
by
hostalrich
and
granollers
but
the
former
had
been
so
conscientiously
destroyed
by
lord
cochrane
and
the
local
that
cyr
regarded
it
as
impassable
there
were
places
where
it
had
been
blasted
away
for
lengths
of
a
quarter
or
a
half
of
a
mile
moreover
at
many
points
the
army
would
have
to
defile
under
the
cliffs
for
long
distances
and
might
be
shelled
by
any
british
that
should
happen
to
lie
off
the
coast
accordingly
the
french
general
determined
to
try
the
inland
road
though
he
would
have
to
march
round
gerona
and
the
smaller
fortress
of
hostalrich
and
though
it
was
cut
by
several
admirable
positions
where
the
catalans
might
offer
battle
with
reasonable
prospects
of
success
it
was
that
vives
should
be
left
as
long
as
possible
in
uncertainty
as
to
his
adversary
s
next
move
and
that
the
catalans
should
be
dealt
with
in
detail
rather
than
in
mass
cyr
resolved
therefore
to
make
a
show
of
attacking
gerona
and
to
try
whether
he
could
not
catch
lazan
and
alvarez
and
rout
them
before
the
should
come
up
to
their
assistance
see
vol
cyr
de
l
armée
de
on
december
therefore
cyr
had
his
whole
corps
minus
the
division
of
reille
concentrated
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
ter
on
the
next
day
he
manœuvred
as
if
about
to
envelop
gerona
he
had
hoped
that
this
move
would
tempt
lazan
and
alvarez
to
come
out
and
meet
him
in
the
open
but
fully
conscious
that
their
men
would
be
exposed
to
inevitable
defeat
the
two
spanish
officers
wisely
kept
quiet
under
the
walls
of
their
stronghold
having
worked
round
their
flank
cyr
on
the
eleventh
sent
back
the
whole
of
his
artillery
and
heavy
baggage
to
figueras
and
plunged
into
the
mountains
at
la
bispal
he
distributed
four
days
biscuit
to
his
men
warning
them
that
there
would
be
no
further
issue
of
rations
till
they
reached
barcelona
the
light
carts
which
had
been
dragged
thus
far
with
the
food
were
burnt
as
to
munitions
each
soldier
had
fifty
cartridges
in
his
pouch
and
the
carried
more
a
reserve
of
only
ten
rounds
for
each
man
the
equipment
of
the
army
in
short
was
such
that
if
it
failed
to
force
its
way
to
barcelona
within
six
days
it
must
starve
while
if
it
was
forced
to
fight
three
or
four
heavy
engagements
it
would
be
left
helpless
without
a
cartridge
for
a
final
battle
the
general
if
not
the
men
in
the
ranks
fully
realized
the
peril
of
the
situation
cyr
says
that
napoleon
falsified
his
report
when
reprinting
it
in
the
and
put
instead
of
rounds
per
man
to
disguise
the
risk
that
had
been
run
on
the
twelfth
cyr
pushed
along
the
mountains
above
palamos
and
san
feliu
brushing
away
a
body
of
from
the
under
juan
claros
who
tried
to
hold
the
defile
on
the
thirteenth
the
french
reached
vidreras
where
they
were
again
on
a
decent
road
that
which
goes
from
gerona
to
malgrat
they
now
perceived
that
they
were
being
followed
by
lazan
and
the
garrison
of
gerona
whose
were
visible
on
the
heights
to
the
north
while
troops
evidently
detached
from
the
blockade
of
barcelona
were
visible
in
front
of
them
it
was
clear
that
cyr
had
at
least
succeeded
in
placing
himself
between
the
two
main
forces
which
the
enemy
could
oppose
to
him
and
might
engage
them
separately
he
might
also
count
on
the
spaniards
looking
for
him
on
the
road
on
which
he
was
now
established
while
it
was
his
intention
to
abandon
it
in
order
to
plunge
inland
once
more
and
to
fall
into
the
main
to
barcelona
south
of
hostalrich
that
a
path
existed
along
which
such
a
movement
could
be
carried
out
was
only
known
to
the
general
by
the
report
of
a
perpignan
smuggler
who
had
once
kept
sheep
among
these
hills
but
when
exploring
parties
tried
to
find
it
they
lost
their
way
and
reported
that
no
such
route
existed
if
this
was
the
fact
cyr
was
ruined
but
he
refused
to
believe
the
officers
who
assured
him
that
the
smuggler
had
erred
and
pushing
among
the
rocks
finally
discovered
it
himself
during
his
exploration
he
was
nearly
cut
off
by
a
party
of
and
his
escort
had
to
fight
hard
in
order
to
save
him
but
the
road
was
found
and
on
the
fifteenth
the
army
followed
it
almost
in
single
file
while
the
dragoons
had
to
dismount
and
lead
their
horses
they
saw
the
fortress
of
hostalrich
in
the
valley
below
them
and
passed
it
in
sight
of
the
garrison
some
of
the
latter
came
out
and
skirmished
with
the
rearguard
of
cyr
s
long
column
but
they
were
too
weak
to
do
much
harm
while
lazan
whose
advent
from
the
north
would
have
caused
more
serious
difficulties
had
been
completely
eluded
and
never
came
in
sight
in
the
afternoon
the
whole
expeditionary
force
safely
descended
into
the
barcelona
near
san
celoni
from
which
place
they
drove
out
four
battalions
of
the
first
troops
that
the
tardy
vives
had
detached
from
his
main
army
the
men
were
much
fatigued
and
the
were
beginning
to
give
trouble
both
in
flank
and
rear
but
cyr
insisted
that
they
should
not
encamp
by
san
celoni
but
push
southward
through
the
difficult
defile
of
the
trentapassos
so
that
they
might
not
find
it
held
against
them
on
the
following
morning
this
was
done
and
the
best
of
the
many
positions
which
the
spaniards
might
have
held
to
oppose
the
march
of
the
invaders
was
occupied
without
the
least
resistance
cyr
encamped
at
the
southern
end
of
the
pass
and
saw
before
him
when
the
night
had
fallen
a
line
of
far
down
the
valley
of
the
besos
which
showed
that
the
spaniards
from
the
leaguer
of
barcelona
had
at
last
come
out
to
oppose
him
the
conduct
of
vives
during
the
last
six
days
had
been
in
perfect
keeping
with
the
rest
of
his
slow
and
stupid
guidance
of
the
campaign
he
had
received
in
due
course
news
of
the
fall
of
rosas
and
soon
after
the
additional
information
that
cyr
had
crossed
the
ter
and
was
threatening
gerona
opinion
was
divided
in
the
camp
of
the
catalans
as
to
whether
the
french
were
about
to
lay
siege
to
that
fortress
or
to
pass
it
by
and
make
a
dash
for
the
relief
of
duhesme
if
they
sat
down
before
gerona
there
was
no
need
to
hurry
if
they
should
pass
it
by
it
would
be
necessary
to
move
at
once
in
order
to
occupy
the
defiles
against
them
the
opinion
of
the
more
intelligent
officers
was
that
cyr
would
be
forced
to
march
to
aid
duhesme
whose
want
of
provisions
was
well
known
by
secret
intelligence
sent
out
from
barcelona
unfortunately
vives
inclined
to
the
other
side
he
preferred
to
believe
the
alternative
which
did
not
impose
on
him
the
necessity
for
instant
and
decisive
action
he
did
nothing
and
pretended
to
be
waiting
for
further
news
it
reached
him
on
the
night
of
december
in
the
form
of
a
message
from
the
junta
of
gerona
to
the
effect
that
the
french
had
sent
back
their
artillery
and
were
plunging
into
the
mountains
in
the
direction
of
la
bispal
so
that
it
was
clear
that
they
must
be
marching
to
relieve
duhesme
it
might
have
been
expected
that
the
would
now
at
last
break
up
from
his
lines
and
hasten
to
throw
himself
across
the
path
of
the
approaching
enemy
but
after
holding
a
long
and
fruitless
council
of
war
he
contented
himself
with
sending
out
reding
with
that
part
of
the
granadan
division
which
had
reached
catalonia
on
the
twelfth
therefore
the
swiss
general
started
by
the
inland
road
with
seven
battalions
of
his
own
andalusian
levies
and
a
regiment
of
cavalry
next
day
he
reached
granollers
and
halted
there
at
the
same
time
francisco
milans
with
four
tercios
of
was
sent
out
to
guard
the
the
other
possible
line
of
approach
by
which
cyr
might
arrive
reding
had
men
milans
but
vives
still
lay
before
barcelona
with
of
his
army
at
least
or
bayonets
it
was
in
vain
that
caldagues
the
preserver
of
gerona
implored
him
to
leave
no
more
than
a
screen
of
in
the
lines
and
to
sally
forth
to
fight
with
every
regular
soldier
that
he
could
muster
the
refused
to
listen
supporting
his
inactivity
by
pleading
that
the
advice
sent
from
gerona
did
not
speak
of
the
enemy
s
force
as
very
large
the
defiles
he
urged
were
so
difficult
that
reding
and
milans
aided
by
lazan
ought
to
be
able
to
hold
them
against
any
small
expeditionary
force
thus
cyr
was
left
to
work
out
his
daring
plan
without
any
serious
opposition
the
only
force
with
which
he
came
in
contact
was
milans
brigade
of
who
finding
the
clear
had
crossed
the
mountains
and
occupied
san
celoni
these
were
the
troops
whom
cyr
drove
away
on
the
afternoon
of
the
fifteenth
before
entering
the
defile
of
the
trentapassos
on
receiving
news
of
this
combat
which
had
taken
place
only
miles
from
his
lines
vives
at
last
set
out
in
person
but
persisting
in
his
idiotic
notion
of
blocking
barcelona
to
the
last
moment
he
left
caldagues
before
the
place
with
men
and
marched
with
a
single
brigade
of
bayonets
to
join
reding
moving
all
through
the
night
of
the
he
joined
the
granadans
at
daybreak
at
cardadeu
on
the
their
united
strength
was
only

of
whom
were

and
seven
guns
this
was
the
whole
force

fought

for

moving
with
culpable
slowness
was
still
far
north
of
san
celoni
when
he
should
have
been
pressing
on
the
rear
of
the
french
while

with
the
who
had
been
beaten
on
the
previous
day
was
some
miles
away

miles
of

yet
took
no
part
in
the
battle

in

central

apart

that

cyr
saw
that
he
must
win
by
one
short
and
swift
stroke
or
suffer
a
complete
disaster
accordingly
he
had
resolved
to
form
his
two
strong
divisions
more
than
men
into
one
great
column
which
was
to
charge
the
spanish

it

take

and
in
two
hours
lazan
may
be
on
the
spot
attacking
our
rear
not

we
must
simply
rush
at
and
trample
down
the

in
our
front
whatever
its
strength
may
be
our
food

done
our

almost
exhausted
the

is

the

there
must

not

though
his
position
is
strong
we
must
go
straight
at
it
in
column
and
burst
through
the
centre
by
striking
at
that
one
point
with
our
whole
force
the
enemy
must
be
given
no
time
to
prepare
his
defence
or
bring
up
his
reserves
you
must
not
change
the
disposition
in
column
in
which
we
march
even
in
order
to
take
great
numbers
of
prisoners
our
sole
end
is
to
break
through
and
to
get
as
close
as
we
can
to

this
evening

must

this
order
of
battle
was
most
hazardous
if
cyr
had
found
in
front
of
him
two
steady
english
divisions
instead
of
reding
s
raw
granadan
levies
and
the
gallant
but
untrained
catalan
it
is
certain
that
affairs
would
have
gone
as
at
busaco
or
talavera
dense
columns
attacking
a
fair
position
held
by
good
troops
in
line
are
bound
to
suffer
terrible
losses
and
ought
never
to
succeed
but
cyr
knew
the
enemies
with
whom
he
had
to
deal
and
his
method
was
well
adapted
to
his
end
if
he
ran
some
risk
of
failing
at
the
commencement
of
the
action
it
was
simply
because
his
subordinates
did
not
follow
out
his
directions
general
pino
on
whom
the
responsibility
of
opening
the
attack
devolved
started
with
every
intention
of
obedience
but
when
he
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
spanish
position
and
the
balls
began
to
fall
thickly
among
his
leading
battalions
he
lost
his
head
his
column
only
faced
the
spanish
right
centre
and
the
heavy
flanking
fire
from
the
hostile
wings
daunted
him
instead
of
pushing
straight
before
him
with
his
whole
force
as
cyr
had
ordered
he
threw
out
five
battalions
of
mazzuchelli
s
brigade
to
his
left
and
two
battalions
under
general
fontane
to
his
extreme
right
the
six
battalions
of
his
rear
brigade
were
not
yet
up
to
the
front
and
took
no
part
in
the
first
assault
thus
he
attacked
on
a
front
of
of
a
mile
instead
of
at
one
single
point
his
columns
after
driving
in
the
spanish
front
line
came
to
a
stand
up
the
hill
in
a
very
irregular
array
the
flanks
thrown
forward
the
centre
hanging
somewhat
back
reding
against
whom
the
main
attack
of
mazzuchelli
s
brigade
had
been
directed
brought
up
his
second
line
and
when
the
italians
were
slackening
in
their
advance
hurled
at
them
two
squadrons
of
hussars
and
led
forward
his
whole
division
the
assailants
broke
and
fell
back
with
loss
three
battalions
of
the
of
the
line
and
two
of
the
light
infantry
one
battalion
of
the
light
infantry
and
one
of
the
of
the
line
cyr
coming
up
to
the
front
at
this
moment
was
horrified
to
mark
the
results
of
pino
s
disobedience
of
his
orders
but
he
had
still
souham
s
division
in
hand
and
flung
it
in
one
solid
mass
of
ten
battalions
upon
reding
s
right
at
the
same
time
he
commanded
pino
to
throw
the
two
regiments
of
his
intact
rear
brigade
upon
the
spanish
centre
while
fontane
s
two
battalions
continued
to
demonstrate
against
the
enemy
s
left
the
result
was
what
might
have
been
expected
the
column
of
souham
burst
through
the
granadan
division
and
completely
routed
the
right
wing
of
the
spanish
army
at
the
same
moment
pino
s
main
column
forced
back
vives
and
the
catalans
along
the
line
of
the
all
at
once
fell
into
confusion
and
when
cyr
bade
his
two
italian
cavalry
regiments
charge
up
the
the
enemy
broke
his
ranks
and
fled
to
the
hills
five
of
the
seven
spanish
guns
were
captured
with
two
standards
and
some
unwounded
prisoners
reding
who
stayed
behind
to
the
last
trying
to
rally
a
rearguard
for
the
protection
of
the
routed
host
was
nearly
taken
prisoner
and
had
to
draw
his
sword
and
cut
his
way
out
vives
whose
conduct
on
this
day
was
anything
but
creditable
scrambled
up
a
cliff
after
turning
his
horse
loose
and
came
almost
alone
to
the
near
mongat
where
he
was
picked
up
by
the
boats
of
the
frigate
and
forwarded
to
tarragona
besides
the
prisoners
the
spaniards
lost
at
least
a
thousand
men
and
many
of
the
dispersed
to
their
homes
cyr
acknowledged
casualties
nearly
all
of
them
as
might
have
been
expected
in
pino
s
division
three
battalions
each
of
the
and
of
the
line
reding
at
last
succeeded
in
rallying
some
troops
at
monmalo
near
san
culgat
and
covered
the
retreat
of
the
main
mass
of
the
fugitives
to
join
the
troops
who
had
been
left
in
the
lines
before
barcelona
as
to
the
detached
spanish
corps
under
milans
and
the
marquis
of
lazan
the
former
never
came
down
from
the
hills
till
the
fighting
was
over
though
it
was
only
four
or
five
miles
from
the
scene
of
action
the
latter
which
was
following
in
cyr
s
rear
moved
with
such
extreme
slowness
that
it
had
not
yet
reached
san
celoni
when
the
battle
was
fought
and
did
not
even
get
into
contact
with
chabot
s
division
which
had
been
left
behind
to
guard
against
its
approach
on
learning
of
the
defeat
the
marquis
marched
back
to
gerona
and
rejoined
alvarez
thus
vives
got
no
assistance
whatever
from
his
outlying
corps
if
lazan
is
to
be
trusted
this
was
largely
the
fault
of
the
himself
for
no
dispatch
from
him
reached
his
subordinates
after
december
and
they
had
no
knowledge
of
his
movements
or
designs
see
the
account
of
cabanes
who
was
with
milans
this
day
in
his
of
the
war
in
see
the
narrative
of
an
officer
in
the
division
of
lazan
printed
by
cabanes
as
an
appendix
meanwhile
caldagues
who
had
been
left
in
charge
of
the
blockade
had
maintained
his
post
and
repulsed
a
heavy
sortie
which
duhesme
and
the
garrison
had
directed
against
his
posts
on
the
sixteenth
but
when
the
news
of
the
battle
of
cardadeu
reached
him
in
the
evening
he
evacuated
all
the
parts
of
his
line
which
lay
to
the
east
of
the
llobregat
and
concentrated
his
men
at
molins
de
rey
and
san
boy
on
the
further
bank
of
that
river
he
was
forced
to
abandon
at
sarria
the
large
dépôt
of
provisions
from
which
the
left
wing
of
the
investing
force
had
been
fed
the
road
from
cardadeu
and
san
culgat
to
barcelona
being
thus
left
open
cyr
marched
in
triumph
into
barcelona
on
the
morning
of
the
seventeenth
he
complains
in
his
memoirs
that
he
did
not
discover
one
single
vedette
from
the
garrison
pushed
out
to
meet
him
and
that
duhesme
did
not
come
forth
to
receive
him
or
give
him
a
single
word
of
thanks
indeed
when
the
governor
at
last
presented
himself
to
meet
the
commander
of
the
seventh
corps
he
spent
his
first
words
not
in
expressing
his
appreciation
for
the
service
which
had
been
rendered
him
but
in
demonstrating
that
he
had
never
been
in
danger
and
could
have
held
out
for
six
weeks
more
he
was
somewhat
abashed
when
cyr
replied
by
presenting
him
with
a
copy
of
one
of
his
own
former
dispatches
to
berthier
which
painted
the
condition
of
the
garrison
in
the
blackest
colours
and
asked
for
instant
succours
lest
the
worst
might
happen
cyr
as
any
reader
of
his
can
see
was
malicious
and
sarcastic
but
duhesme
has
a
bad
reputation
for
carelessness
and
selfishness
and
his
writings
make
an
even
worse
impression
than
those
of
cyr
probably
the
latter
s
narrative
is
fairly
correct
it
was
clear
that
the
two
generals
would
not
work
well
together
but
as
cyr
held
the
supreme
command
and
was
determined
to
assert
himself
duhesme
could
do
no
more
than
sulk
in
silence
the
conduct
of
the
operations
against
the
catalans
had
been
taken
completely
out
of
his
hands
cyr
s
daring
march
to
barcelona
had
been
crowned
with
complete
success
it
was
by
far
the
most
brilliant
operation
on
the
french
side
during
the
first
year
of
the
war
that
it
was
perilous
can
not
be
denied
if
the
commander
of
the
seventh
corps
had
found
the
whole
army
of
vives
entrenched
at
the
passage
of
the
tordera
or
across
the
defile
of
the
trentapassos
it
seems
impossible
that
he
could
have
got
forward
to
barcelona
thirty
thousand
men
of
whom
half
were
regular
troops
might
have
been
opposed
to
him
and
they
could
have
brought
artillery
against
him
while
he
had
not
a
single
piece
if
once
checked
he
must
have
retreated
in
haste
for
he
had
only
ammunition
for
a
single
battle
but
the
rapid
and
unexpected
character
of
his
movements
entirely
puzzled
the
enemy
and
he
was
fortunate
in
having
a
vives
to
contend
against
when
the
enemy
has
no
general
as
schepeler
remarks
while
commenting
on
this
campaign
any
stroke
of
luck
is
against
a
capable
officer
cyr
would
probably
have
failed
but
he
had
a
shrewd
suspicion
of
the
character
of
his
opponent
from
what
had
happened
during
the
siege
of
rosas
he
dared
much
and
his
daring
was
rewarded
by
a
splendid
victory
the
campaign
however
was
not
yet
completed
barcelona
had
been
relieved
but
only
a
fraction
of
the
spanish
army
had
been
met
and
beaten
caldagues
lay
behind
the
llobregat
with
men
who
had
not
yet
been
engaged
reding
had
joined
him
with
the
wrecks
of
the
troops
which
had
fought
at
cardadeu
some
or
men
they
lined
the
eastern
bank
of
the
river
only
six
or
seven
miles
from
the
suburbs
of
barcelona
occupying
the
entrenchments
which
had
been
constructed
to
shut
in
duhesme
during
the
blockade
these
were
strengthened
with
several
redoubts
some
of
them
armed
with
heavy
artillery
and
the
positions
were
good
but
too
extensive
for
a
force
of
or
men
their
weak
point
was
that
the
llobregat
even
in
december
is
fordable
in
many
places
and
that
if
the
french
attacked
in
mass
at
one
point
they
were
almost
certain
of
being
able
to
force
their
way
through
the
line
reding
and
his
caldagues
were
both
of
opinion
that
it
would
be
wise
to
evacuate
the
lines
if
cyr
should
come
out
in
force
against
them
and
to
fall
back
on
the
mountains
in
their
rear
which
separate
the
valley
of
the
llobregat
from
the
of
tarragona
here
there
was
a
strong
position
at
the
defile
of
ordal
where
it
was
intended
to
construct
an
entrenched
camp
but
there
was
a
strong
temptation
to
hold
on
in
the
old
lines
for
as
long
a
time
as
possible
for
by
retiring
to
ordal
the
army
would
leave
open
the
to
lerida
and
saragossa
and
give
up
much
of
the
plain
to
the
incursions
of
the
french
foragers
reding
sent
back
to
vives
who
had
now
landed
in
his
rear
and
placed
himself
at
villanueva
de
sitjas
to
ask
whether
he
was
to
retreat
at
once
or
to
hold
his
ground
the
sent
back
the
inconclusive
reply
that
he
might
fall
back
on
ordal
if
he
could
not
defend
the
line
of
the
thus
he
threw
back
the
responsibility
on
his
subordinate
and
reding
anxious
to
vindicate
his
courage
before
the
eyes
of
the
catalans
resolved
after
some
hesitation
to
retain
his
positions
though
he
had
grave
doubts
of
the
possibility
of
resistance
some
of
his
had
absconded
during
the
withdrawal
from
the
eastern
half
of
the
river
he
was
not
allowed
much
time
to
ponder
over
the
situation
the
reply
of
vives
only
reached
him
on
the
night
of
december
on
the
next
morning
cyr
came
out
of
barcelona
and
attacked
the
lines
he
had
brought
with
him
every
available
man
duhesme
had
been
left
to
hold
the
city
with
lecchi
s
italians
alone
his
other
division
that
of
chabran
together
with
the
three
which
had
formed
the
army
of
succour
those
of
souham
pino
and
chabot
were
all
directed
against
the
lines
the
plan
of
cyr
was
to
demonstrate
against
the
bridge
of
molins
de
rey
the
strongest
part
of
the
spanish
position
with
chabran
s
men
while
he
himself
crossed
the
fords
lower
down
the
llobregat
with
the
bayonets
of
the
other
three
divisions
and
turned
the
right
flank
of
the
enemy
at
five
o
clock
on
a
miserable
gusty
december
morning
the
french
came
down
towards
the
river
chabran
led
off
by
making
a
noisy
demonstration
opposite
the
redoubts
at
the
bridge
on
the
northern
flank
of
the
position
this
as
cyr
had
intended
drew
reding
s
attention
to
that
flank
he
reinforced
his
left
with
troops
drawn
from
his
right
wing
on
the
lower
and
easier
ground
down
stream
an
hour
later
the
other
attacking
columns
advanced
that
of
souham
crossing
the
ford
of
san
juan
despi
while
pino
and
chabot
passed
by
that
of
san
feliu
no
proper
attempt
was
made
to
dispute
their
advance
outnumbered
and
strung
out
along
a
very
extensive
position
the
catalans
soon
saw
their
line
broken
in
several
places
the
only
serious
opposition
made
was
by
the
centre
which
advanced
down
hill
against
souham
and
tried
to
charge
him
but
gave
back
long
before
bayonets
had
been
crossed
the
most
fatal
part
of
reding
s
position
was
that
on
his
extreme
right
chabot
s
three
battalions
had
got
completely
round
his
flank
and
kept
edging
in
on
the
rear
of
his
southern
wing
which
abandoned
hill
after
hill
as
it
saw
its
retreat
threatened
pino
and
souham
had
only
to
press
on
and
each
regiment
in
their
front
gave
way
in
turn
when
it
saw
its
exposed
flank
in
danger
at
last
the
whole
of
the
spanish
right
and
centre
was
pushed
back
in
disorder
on
to
the
still
intact
left
behind
the
bridge
of
molins
de
rey
now
was
the
time
for
chabran
to
turn
his
demonstration
into
a
real
attack
if
he
had
crossed
the
river
and
advanced
rapidly
he
would
have
caught
the
shaken
masses
in
front
while
the
rest
of
the
army
chased
them
forward
into
his
arms
but
being
timid
or
unenterprising
he
let
the
flying
enemy
pass
across
his
front
unmolested
and
only
forded
the
river
when
they
had
gone
too
far
to
be
caught
the
unhappy
vives
came
up
at
this
moment
just
in
time
to
see
his
whole
army
on
the
run
and
headed
their
flight
to
the
hills
thus
the
spaniards
got
away
without
any
very
crushing
losses
though
their
historian
cabanes
confesses
that
if
chabran
had
moved
a
quarter
of
an
hour
earlier
he
would
have
captured
half
the
army
of
catalonia
as
it
was
cyr
took
about
prisoners
only
though
his
dragoons
pursued
the
routed
enemy
for
many
miles
it
was
a
great
misfortune
for
the
catalans
that
among
these
captives
was
the
conde
de
caldagues
the
one
officer
in
their
ranks
he
was
taken
by
the
pursuers
at
vendrell
many
miles
from
the
field
when
his
exhausted
horse
fell
under
him
cyr
captured
the
whole
artillery
of
the
spaniards
cannon
of
which
several
were
pieces
of
heavy
calibre
mounted
in
redoubts
the
were
more
useful
to
him
as
he
was
very
short
of
artillery
he
had
brought
none
with
him
while
duhesme
had
been
obliged
to
destroy
the
greater
part
of
his
during
the
retreat
from
gerona
in
august
he
also
made
prize
of
a
magazine
of
cartridges
and
of
many
thousands
of
muskets
which
the
routed
enemy
cast
away
in
their
haste
to
escape
over
the
hills
some
of
the
fugitives
fled
south
and
did
not
stop
till
they
reached
tortosa
and
the
ebro
others
dispersed
in
the
direction
of
igualada
and
lerida
but
the
main
body
rallied
at
tarragona
cyr
says
in
his
report
to
napoleon
but
increases
the
number
to
fifty
in
his
the
victorious
french
divisions
were
pushed
far
out
from
the
so
as
to
occupy
not
only
the
whole
plain
of
the
llobregat
but
also
the
defiles
over
the
hills
leading
to
tarragona
chabran
was
placed
at
martorell
chabot
at
san
sadurni
souham
at
vendrell
and
pino
at
villanueva
de
sitjas
and
villafranca
thus
the
pass
of
ordal
was
in
the
victor
s
hands
and
he
had
it
in
his
power
to
march
against
tarragona
without
having
any
further
positions
to
force
but
the
siege
of
that
place
did
not
form
at
present
any
part
of
cyr
s
designs
his
aim
was
first
to
collect
such
magazines
at
barcelona
as
would
feed
his
whole
army
of
men
till
the
harvest
was
ripe
and
secondly
to
reopen
his
communication
with
france
the
sea
route
was
rendered
dangerous
by
the
english
ships
which
were
continually
hovering
off
the
coast
the
land
route
was
blocked
by
the
fortresses
of
hostalrich
and
gerona
cyr
imagined
that
it
was
more
important
to
make
an
end
of
these
places
and
open
his
route
to
perpignan
than
to
attack
tarragona
the
latter
place
was
strong
and
the
greater
part
of
the
catalan
army
had
taken
refuge
in
it
the
siege
would
need
as
he
supposed
many
months
and
could
not
be
properly
conducted
till
a
and
a
large
store
of
ammunition
had
been
brought
down
from
france
it
is
possible
that
the
french
general
might
have
come
to
another
conclusion
if
he
had
been
aware
of
the
state
of
panic
and
disorganization
among
the
catalans
at
this
moment
the
had
mostly
dispersed
to
their
homes
the
regular
troops
were
mutinous
and
the
populace
was
crying
treason
and
looking
for
the
incapable
vives
was
frightened
into
resignation
and
finally
replaced
by
reding
whose
courage
at
least
was
beyond
suspicion
if
his
abilities
were
not
those
of
a
great
general
the
smaller
towns
were
full
of
tumults
and
assassination
at
lerida
a
certain
gomez
declared
himself
dictator
and
began
to
seize
and
execute
all
suspected
persons
he
did
not
stop
till
he
was
caught
and
beheaded
by
a
battalion
which
reding
sent
out
against
him
in
short
anarchy
reigned
in
catalonia
for
ten
days
and
it
is
possible
that
if
cyr
had
marched
straight
to
tarragona
he
might
have
taken
the
place
though
its
inhabitants
were
working
hard
at
their
fortifications
and
vowing
to
emulate
saragossa
many
historians
of
the
war
have
blamed
the
french
general
for
not
making
the
attempt
but
there
was
much
to
urge
in
his
defence
it
is
perfectly
possible
that
the
tarragonese
might
have
made
a
gallant
stand
in
spite
of
all
their
troubles
for
the
garrison
was
large
if
disorderly
if
they
held
out
cyr
had
neither
a
siege
equipage
nor
sufficient
magazines
to
feed
his
army
when
concentrated
in
a
single
spot
the
french
troops
were
exhausted
and
suffering
dreadfully
from
the
inclement
winter
weather
lazan
and
alvarez
were
in
full
force
in
the
ampurdam
and
were
giving
reille
s
weak
division
much
trouble
probably
therefore
cyr
was
justified
in
halting
for
a
month
which
he
employed
in
clearing
the
whole
for
thirty
miles
round
barcelona
and
in
collecting
the
stores
of
food
which
his
army
required
before
it
could
make
another
move
the
halt
allowed
time
for
the
catalans
to
rally
and
for
reding
to
reorganize
his
army
by
february
he
was
ready
once
more
to
try
his
fortune
in
the
field
indeed
he
was
ere
long
more
formidable
than
cyr
had
expected
for
he
was
joined
by
the
second
brigade
of
his
own
granadan
division
which
came
up
from
valencia
not
long
after
the
battle
of
molins
de
rey
and
the
last
reserves
from
majorca
had
also
sailed
to
aid
him
after
giving
over
the
fortifications
of
the
balearic
isles
to
the
marines
of
the
fleet
and
the
urban
guards
of
palma
and
port
mahon
the
too
returned
to
their
standards
when
the
first
panic
was
over
and
in
a
month
catalonia
could
once
more
show
an
army
of
men
the
first
incident
which
occurred
to
encourage
the
insurgents
was
that
on
january
lazan
fell
upon
and
very
severely
handled
a
detached
battalion
of
reille
s
division
at
castellon
in
the
ampurdam
and
when
reille
came
up
against
him
in
person
with
men
inflicted
on
him
a
sharp
check
at
the
fords
of
the
muga
not
long
after
however
the
marquis
withdrew
from
this
region
and
marched
back
toward
aragon
taking
with
him
his
own
division
and
leaving
only
the
weak
corps
of
alvarez
to
deal
with
reille
his
retreat
was
caused
by
the
news
of
his
brother
s
desperate
position
in
saragossa
hoping
to
make
a
diversion
in
favour
of
palafox
lazan
marched
to
lerida
where
he
began
to
gather
in
all
the
men
that
he
could
collect
before
moving
back
to
his
native
province
thus
the
pressure
on
reille
was
much
reduced
this
was
the
battalion
of
the
of
the
line
which
had
joined
reille
in
the
late
autumn
and
did
not
form
part
of
his
original
division
as
detailed
in
the
appendix
to
vol
cyr
says
that
it
only
lost
sixty
prisoners
besides
some
casualties
lazan
wrote
that
he
took
ninety
prisoners
and
killed
or
wounded
over
more
frenchmen
cyr
s
men
meanwhile
made
many
expeditions
into
the
valleys
above
barcelona
they
cleared
the
defile
of
bruch
leading
into
the
upper
valley
of
the
llobregat
which
the
had
held
so
gallantly
against
schwartz
and
chabran
in
june
they
took
but
did
not
hold
the
almost
inaccessible
peak
of
montserrat
and
on
the
dominated
the
country
as
far
as
mataro
but
they
could
not
reopen
the
communications
with
france
their
general
did
not
dare
to
set
about
the
siege
of
gerona
while
reding
had
still
the
makings
of
an
army
in
the
direction
of
tarragona
it
was
not
till
that
brave
but
unfortunate
officer
had
received
his
defeat
in
february
that
cyr
was
able
to
turn
his
attention
to
the
north
and
the
road
to
perpignan
for
the
present
the
french
general
found
himself
mainly
occupied
by
the
imperious
necessity
for
scraping
together
food
not
only
for
his
own
army
but
for
the
great
city
of
barcelona
where
both
the
garrison
and
the
people
were
living
from
hand
to
mouth
for
the
resources
of
the
neighbouring
plain
were
nearly
exhausted
and
the
only
external
supply
came
from
occasional
merchantmen
from
cette
or
marseilles
whose
captains
were
tempted
to
run
the
british
blockade
by
the
enormous
price
which
they
could
secure
for
their
corn
if
it
could
be
brought
safely
through
it
was
only
somewhat
later
that
the
emperor
directed
the
naval
authorities
in
provence
to
dispatch
regular
convoys
to
barcelona
under
a
strong
escort
whenever
the
british
cruisers
were
reported
to
have
been
blown
out
to
sea
meanwhile
the
problem
of
food
supplies
remained
almost
as
urgent
a
question
for
cyr
as
the
movements
of
his
adversaries
in
the
field
section
x
chapter
iii
the
campaign
of
february
battle
of
valls
more
than
a
month
had
elapsed
since
the
battle
of
molins
de
rey
before
any
important
movements
were
made
in
catalonia
early
in
february
cyr
drew
in
his
divisions
from
the
advanced
positions
in
the
plain
of
tarragona
which
they
had
taken
up
after
the
victory
of
molins
de
rey
they
had
eaten
up
the
and
were
being
much
harassed
by
the
who
had
begun
to
press
in
upon
their
communications
with
barcelona
in
spite
of
all
the
care
that
was
taken
to
scour
the
country
with
small
flying
columns
and
to
scatter
any
nucleus
of
insurgents
that
began
to
grow
up
in
the
french
rear
owing
to
the
dispersion
of
the
divisions
of
the
corps
these
operations
were
very
laborious
between
the
new
year
and
the
middle
of
february
cyr
calculated
that
his
men
had
used
up
cartridges
in
petty
skirmishes
and
suffered
a
very
appreciable
loss
in
operations
that
were
practically
worthless
accordingly
he
drew
them
closer
together
in
order
to
shorten
the
dangerously
extended
line
of
communication
with
barcelona
cyr
de
reding
during
this
period
of
waiting
had
been
keeping
quiet
in
tarragona
where
he
was
reorganizing
and
drilling
the
harassed
troops
which
had
been
beaten
at
cardadeu
and
molins
de
rey
he
had
as
we
have
already
seen
received
heavy
reinforcements
from
the
south
and
the
balearic
isles
but
it
was
not
in
numbers
only
that
his
army
had
improved
cyr
s
inaction
had
restored
their
they
were
too
as
regards
food
and
munitions
in
a
much
better
condition
than
their
adversaries
as
they
could
freely
draw
provisions
from
the
plain
of
the
lower
ebro
and
the
northern
parts
of
valencia
and
were
besides
helped
by
corn
brought
in
by
british
and
spanish
vessels
from
the
whole
eastern
mediterranean
reding
had
also
got
a
good
supply
of
arms
and
ammunition
from
england
as
he
found
himself
unmolested
he
was
finally
able
to
rearrange
his
whole
force
so
as
not
only
to
cover
tarragona
but
to
extend
a
screen
of
troops
all
round
the
french
position
he
now
divided
his
army
into
two
wings
he
himself
on
the
right
kept
in
hand
at
tarragona
the
division
consisting
mainly
of
the
granadan
troops
while
general
castro
was
sent
to
establish
the
head
quarters
of
the
division
which
contained
most
of
the
old
battalions
of
the
army
of
catalonia
at
igualada
their
line
of
communication
was
by
santa
coloma
sarreal
and
montblanch
this
disposition
was
probably
a
mistake
while
the
french
lay
concentrated
in
the
middle
of
the
semicircle
the
spanish
army
was
forced
to
operate
on
outer
lines
sixty
miles
long
and
could
not
mass
itself
in
less
than
three
or
four
days
by
a
sudden
movement
of
the
enemy
either
reding
or
castro
might
be
assailed
by
superior
numbers
and
forced
to
fall
back
on
an
eccentric
line
of
retreat
before
he
could
be
succoured
by
his
colleague
regiments
of
santa
fé
and
of
antequera
three
battalions
with
men
in
november
and
probably
in
february
swiss
regiment
of
beschard
about
strong
and
majorca
militia
sometimes
called
palma
strong
it
would
seem
that
encouraged
by
cyr
s
quiescence
his
own
growing
strength
and
the
protestations
of
the
catalans
reding
had
once
more
resolved
to
resume
the
offensive
the
extension
of
his
left
to
igualada
was
made
with
no
less
ambitious
a
purpose
than
that
of
outflanking
the
northern
wing
of
the
french
army
and
then
delivering
a
simultaneous
concentric
attack
on
its
scattered
divisions
as
they
lay
in
their
cantonments
such
a
plan
presupposed
that
cyr
would
keep
quiet
while
the
preparations
were
being
made
that
he
would
fail
to
concentrate
in
time
and
that
the
spanish
columns
operating
from
two
distant
bases
would
succeed
in
timing
their
with
perfect
accuracy
at
the
best
they
could
only
have
brought
some
men
against
the
of
cyr
s
field
army
a
superiority
far
from
sufficient
to
give
them
a
rational
chance
of
success
it
is
probable
that
at
this
moment
reding
s
best
chance
of
doing
something
great
for
the
cause
of
spain
would
have
been
to
leave
a
strong
garrison
in
tarragona
and
march
early
in
february
with
men
to
the
relief
of
saragossa
which
was
now
drawing
near
the
end
of
its
powers
of
resistance
lannes
and
junot
would
have
had
to
raise
the
siege
if
an
army
of
such
size
had
come
up
against
them
but
though
intending
to
succour
saragossa
in
a
few
weeks
reding
was
induced
by
the
constant
entreaties
of
the
catalans
to
undertake
first
an
expedition
against
cyr
he
sent
off
no
troops
to
aid
the
marquis
of
lazan
in
his
fruitless
attempt
to
relax
the
pressure
on
his
brother
s
heroic
garrison
but
devoted
all
his
attention
to
the
corps
cyr
was
not
an
officer
who
was
likely
to
be
caught
unprepared
by
such
a
movement
as
reding
had
planned
the
extension
of
the
spanish
line
to
igualada
and
the
upper
llobregat
had
not
escaped
his
notice
and
he
was
fully
aware
of
the
advantage
which
his
central
position
gave
him
over
an
enemy
who
had
been
obliging
enough
to
draw
out
his
fighting
strength
on
an
arc
of
a
circle
sixty
miles
from
end
to
end
without
fully
realizing
reding
s
intentions
he
could
yet
see
that
the
spaniards
were
giving
him
a
grand
opportunity
of
beating
them
in
detail
he
resolved
to
strike
a
blow
at
their
northern
wing
convinced
that
if
he
acted
with
sufficient
swiftness
and
energy
he
could
crush
it
long
ere
it
could
be
succoured
from
tarragona
it
thus
came
to
pass
that
reding
and
cyr
began
to
move
simultaneously
the
one
on
exterior
the
other
on
interior
lines
with
the
inevitable
result

february

the
intention
of
advancing
against

martorell
at
the
same
time
orders
were
sent
to
alvarez
the
governor
of
gerona
to
detach
all
the
men
he
could
spare
for
a
demonstration
against
barcelona
in
order
to
distract
the
attention
of
duhesme
and
the
garrison
reding
himself
with
the
troops
at
tarragona
intended
to
march
against
souham
the
moment
that
he
should
receive
the
news
that
his
lieutenants
were
ready
to
strike
at
the
same
moment
cyr
started
out
on
his
expedition
against
igualada
he
took
with
him
pino
s
italian
division
and
ordered
chabot
and
chabran
to
concentrate
with
him
at
capellades
seven
or
eight
miles
to
the
of
castro
s
head
quarters
by
taking
this
route
he
avoided
the
northern
bank
of
the
noya
and
the
defiles
of
bruch
and
approached
the
enemy
from
the
side
where
he

most
easily
cut
him
off

coming
from

not
perfectly
timed
those
of
pino
and
chabran
finding
their
way
far
more
difficult
than
did
chabot
it
thus
chanced
that
the
latter
with
his
skeleton
division
of
three
battalions
arrived
in
front
of
capellades
many
hours
before
his
colleagues
his
approach
was
reported
to
castro
at
igualada
who
sent
down
men
against
him
attacked
him
and
beat
him
back
with
loss
into
the
arms
of
pino
who
came
on
the
scene
later
in
the
day
the
spaniards
were
then
forced
to
give
back
and
retired
to
pobla
de
claramunt
on
the
banks
of
the
noya
where
they
were
joined
by
most
of
castro
s
reserves
cyr
had
now
concentrated
his
three
divisions
and
hoped
that
he
might
bring
the
enemy
to
a
pitched
battle
he
drew
up
in
front
of
them
all
his
force
save
one
of
pino
s
brigades
which
he
sent
to
turn
their
right
the
spaniards
having
a
fine
position
behind
a
ravine
were
at
first
inclined
to
fight
and
skirmished
with
the
enemy
s
main
body
for
some
hours
they
narrowly
missed
capturing
both
cyr
and
pino
who
had
ridden
forward
with
their
staff
to
reconnoitre
and
fell
into
an
ambush
of
from
which
they
only
escaped
by
the
speed
of
their
horses
chabot
lost
a
neapolitan
colonel
carascosa
and
many
other
prisoners
cyr
says
nothing
of
his
own
danger
but
the
incident
is
given
at
length
by
vacani
iii
who
mentions
that
one
of
pino
s
was
wounded
but
late
in
the
day
the
spanish
general
received
news
that
mazzuchelli
with
the
detached
italian
brigade
was
already
in
his
rear
and
marching
hard
for
igualada
he
immediately
evacuated
his
position
in
great
disorder
and
fell
back
on
his
head
quarters
closely
pursued
by
cyr
the
main
body
of
the
spaniards
with
their
artillery
just
succeeded
in
passing
through
igualada
before
the
italians
came
up
and
fled
by
the
road
to
cervera
the
rear
was
cut
off
and
had
to
escape
in
another
direction
by
the
path
leading
to
manresa
both
columns
were
much
hustled
and
lost
many
prisoners
yet
they
fairly
outmarched
their
pursuers
and
got
away
without
any
crushing
disaster
but
their
great
loss
was
that
in
igualada
the
french
seized
all
the
magazines
which
had
been
collected
from
northern
catalonia
for
the
use
of
castro
s
division
this
relieved
cyr
from
all
trouble
as
to
provisions
for
many
days
he
had
now
food
enough
not
only
to
provide
for
his
field
army
but
to
send
back
to
barcelona

had
now
done
all
the
harm
that
was
in
his
power
to
the
spanish
left
wing
he
had
beaten
them
seized
their
magazines
driven
them
apart
and
broken
their
line
he
imagined
that
they
were
disposed
of
for
many
days
and
now
resolved
to
turn
off
for
a
blow
at
reding
and
the
other
half
of
the
catalonian
army
who
might
meanwhile
for
all
that
he
knew
be
attacking
souham
with
very
superior
numbers
accordingly
on
he
started
off
with
pino
s
division
to
join
souham
and
fall
upon
reding
leaving
chabot
and
chabran
with
all
the
artillery
of
the
three
divisions
to
occupy
igualada
and
guard
the
captured
magazines
from
any
possible
offensive
return
on
the
part
of
castro
he
marched
by
along
the
of
the
mountains
of
the
great
central
catalonian
sierra
intending
to
descend
into
the
valley
of
the
gaya
by
san
magin
and
the
abbey
of
santas
cruces
where
as
he
had
learnt
lay
the
northernmost
detachments
of
reding
s
division
thus
he
hoped
to
take
the
enemy
in
flank
and
beat
him
in
detail
he
sent
orders
to
souham
to
move
out
of
vendrell
and
meet
him
at
villarodoña
up
the
course
of
gaya
unless
he
should
have
been
already
attacked
by
reding
and
forced
to
take
some
other
line
the
details
of
this
in
a
country
where
the
maps
are
very
deficient
are
more
easily
to
be
made
out
from
vacani
s
narrative
pp
than
from
cyr
s
own
account
at
san
magin
the
french
commander
came
upon
some
of
reding
s
troops
about
men
with
two
guns
under
a
brigadier
named
iranzo
they
showed
fight
but
were
beaten
and
sought
refuge
further
down
the
valley
of
the
gaya
in
the
fortified
abbey
of
santas
cruces
so
bare
was
the
and
so
bad
the
maps
that
cyr
found
considerable
difficulty
in
tracking
them
and
in
discovering
the
best
way
down
the
valley
but
next
day
he
got
upon
their
trail
and
beset
the
abbey
which
made
a
good
defence
and
proved
impregnable
to
a
force
unprovided
with
artillery
cyr
blockaded
it
for
two
days
and
then
descended
into
the
plain
where
he
got
in
touch
with
souham
s
division
which
had
advanced
from
vendrell
and
was
now
pillaging
the
hamlets
round
villarodoña
in
the
central
valley
of
the
gaya
february
cyr
has
a
curious
story
to
the
effect
that
he
had
failed
entirely
to
find
the
road
but
ultimately
discovered
it
by
giving
leave
to
a
wounded
spanish
officer
to
return
to
tarragona
he
was
followed
at
a
discreet
distance
by
scouts
who
noted
the
way
that
he
took
and
he
thus
served
as
a
guide
of
pino
s
division
as
far
as
the
convent
of
santas
cruces
souham
had
anticipated
cyr
s
orders
and
started
to
advance
from
vendrell
before
his
chief
s
dispatch
from
igualada
came
to
hand
meanwhile
reding
was
at
last
on
the
move
on
receiving
the
news
of
the
combat
of
igualada
he
had
to
choose
between
the
opportunity
of
making
a
at
souham
and
that
of
marching
to
the
aid
of
his
lieutenant
castro
he
adopted
the
latter
alternative
and
started
from
tarragona
on
february
with
an
escort
of
about
men
including
nearly
all
his
available
cavalry
it
was
his
intention
to
pick
up
on
the
way
the
outlying
northern
brigades
of
his
division
this
he
succeeded
in
doing
drawing
in
to
himself
the
troops
which
were
guarding
the
pass
of
santa
cristina
and
iranzo
s
detachment
at
santas
cruces
this
force
warned
of
his
approach
broke
through
the
blockade
at
night
and
reached
its
chief
with
little
or
no
loss
february
thus
reinforced
reding
pushed
on
by
sarreal
to
santa
coloma
where
castro
joined
him
with
the
rallied
troops
of
his
wing
whom
he
had
collected
when
the
french
attack
slackened
they
had
between
them
nearly
men
an
imposing
force
with
which
some
of
the
officers
present
suggested
that
it
would
be
possible
to
fall
upon
igualada
crush
chabot
and
chabran
and
recover
the
lost
magazines
but
reding
was
nervous
about
tarragona
dreading
lest
cyr
might
unite
with
souham
and
fall
upon
the
city
during
his
absence
after
holding
a
lengthy
council
of
war
he
determined
to
return
to
protect
his
base
of
operations
accordingly
he
told
off
the
swiss
general
wimpffen
with
some
or
of
castro
s
troops
to
observe
the
french
divisions
at
igualada
and
started
homeward
with
the
rest
of
his
army
about
infantry
cavalry
and
two
batteries
of
field
artillery
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
return
by
the
route
of
montblanch
and
valls
one
somewhat
more
remote
from
the
position
of
cyr
on
the
gaya
than
the
way
by
pla
which
he
had
taken
in
setting
out
to
join
castro
reding
could
only
have
got
home
without
fighting
by
taking
a
circuitous
route
to
the
east
via
selva
and
reus
the
suggestion
that
he
should
do
so
was
made
but
he
replied
that
having
baggage
and
artillery
with
him
he
was
forced
to
keep
to
a
he
chose
that
by
valls
though
he
was
aware
that
the
place
was
occupied
but
apparently
he
hoped
to
crush
souham
before
pino
could
come
to
his
aid
he
was
resolved
it
is
said
not
to
court
a
combat
but
on
the
other
hand
not
to
refuse
it
if
the
enemy
should
offer
to
fight
him
on
advantageous
ground
february
the
truth
is
that
he
was
bold
even
to
rashness
could
never
forget
the
great
day
of
baylen
in
which
he
had
taken
such
a
splendid
part
and
was
anxious
to
wash
out
by
a
victory
the
evil
memories
of
cardadeu
and
molins
de
rey
he
set
out
on
the
evening
of
february
and
by
daybreak
next
morning
was
drawing
near
the
bridge
of
goy
where
the
to
tarragona
crosses
the
river
francoli
some
two
miles
north
of
the
town
of
valls
his
troops
as
was
to
be
expected
were
much
exhausted
by
the
long
march
in
the
darkness
two
battalions
of
lerida
and
of
tarragona
cavalry
a
and
a
battalion
of
reding
s
own
regiment
of
swiss
about
men
in
all
doyle
was
present
at
this
council
his
account
of
it
is
in
the
record
office
he
declares
that
he
himself
was
all
for
fighting
that
reding
wavered
and
the
majority
refused
to
take
risks
there
is
a
detailed
estimate
of
reding
s
army
given
by
cyr
in
his
appendix
no
he
says
that
the
figures
were
given
him
by
a
spanish
general
taken
prisoner
at
valls
which
must
mean
the
marquis
of
casteldosrius
the
only
officer
of
that
rank
captured
the
names
of
nearly
all
the
battalions
cited
in
this
list
are
to
be
verified
either
in
reding
s
dispatch
or
in
the
narrative
of
cabanes
all
indeed
except
the
regiment
of
baza
and
the
three
miquelet
tercios
and
of
tarragona
and
lerida
but
it
is
probable
that
casteldosrius
gave
cyr
a
morning
state
of
the
whole
army
collected
at
santa
coloma
on
the
and
that
these
corps
with
a
total
force
of
men
formed
part
of
the
force
left
with
wimpffen
at
santa
coloma
i
am
driven
to
this
conclusion
by
the
statement
of
doyle
in
his
letter
written
from
santa
coloma
on
the
day
before
the
battle
that
reding
was
marching
with
horse
and
a
little
over
foot
for
tarragona
doyle
is
arguing
in
favour
of
fighting
and
has
no
object
in
understating
the
numbers
his
figures
are
borne
out
by
all
the
spanish
narratives
the
force
must
have
stood

follows

one

therefore
must
be
added
to
my
estimate
of
the

these
details
are
from
doyle
s
letter
of
in
the
record
office
cyr
meanwhile
had
not
been
intending
to
strike
a
blow
at
tarragona
he
regarded
it
as
much
more
necessary
to
beat
the
enemy
s
field
army
than
to
close
in
upon
the
fortress
which
would
indubitably
have
offered
a
long
and
obstinate
resistance
when
he
got
news
of
reding
s
march
to
santa
coloma
he
resolved
to
follow
him
he
was
preparing
to
hasten
to
the
succour
of
his
divisions
at
igualada
when
he
learnt
that
the
swiss
general
had
turned
back
and
was
hurrying
home
to
tarragona
he
resolved
therefore
to
try
to
intercept
him
on
his
return
march
and
blocked
his
two
available
roads
by
placing
souham
s
division
at
valls
and
pino
s
at
pla
they
were
only
eight
or
nine
miles
apart
and
whichever
road
the
spaniards
took
the
unassailed
french
division
could
easily
come
to
the
aid
of
the
other
reding
s
night
march
a
move
which
cyr
does
not
seem
to
have
foreseen
nearly
enabled
him
to
carry
out
his
plan
in
fact
as
we
shall
see
he
had
almost
made
an
end
of
the
french
division
before
the
marshal
who
lay
himself
at
pla
with
the
italians
arrived
to
succour
it
the
french

engaged
at

somewhat
superior
to
that
of
the
spaniards
if
the
latter
had
only
the
corps
given
in
the
last
table
in
the
early
morning
between
six
and
seven
o
clock
the
head
of
the
long
spanish
column
reached
the
bridge
of
goy
and
there
fell
in
with
souham
s
vedettes
the
sharp
musketry
fire
which
at
once
broke
out
warned
each
party
that
a
combat
was
at
hand
souham
hastily
marched
out
from
valls
and
drew
up
his
two
brigades
in
the
plain
to
the
north
of
the
town
placing
himself
across
the
line
of
the
enemy
s
advance
reding
at
first
made
up
his
mind
to
thrust
aside
the
french
division
whose
force
he
somewhat
undervalued
and
to
hurry
on
his
march
toward
tarragona
the
whole
of
his
advanced
guard
and
part
of
his
centre
crossed
the
river
deployed
on
the
left
bank
and
attacked
the
french
souham
held
his
ground
for
some
hours
but
as
more
and
more
spanish
battalions
kept
pressing
across
the
bridge
and
reinforcing
the
enemy
s
line
he
began
after
a
time
to
give
way
the
numerical
odds
were
heavily
against
him
and
the
catalans
were
fighting
with
great
steadiness
and
confidence
before
noon
the
french
division
was
thrust
back
against
the
town
of
valls
and
reding
had
been
able
to
file
not
only
the
greater
part
of
his
army
but
all
his
baggage
across
the
francoli
the
way
to
tarragona
was
clear
and
if
he
had
chosen
to
disengage
his
men
he
could
have
carried
off
the
whole
of
his
army
to
that
city
without
molestation
from
souham
who
was
too
hard
hit
to
wish
to
continue
the
combat
it
is
even
possible
that
if
he
had
hastily
brought
up
all
his
reserves
he
might
have
completely
routed
the
french
detachment
before
it
could
have
been
succoured
but
reding
adopted
neither
one
course
nor
the
other
after
driving
back
souham
he
allowed
his
men
a
long
rest
probably
in
order
to
give
the
rear
and
the
baggage
time
to
complete
the
passage
of
the
francoli
while
things
were
standing
still
cyr
arrived
at
full
gallop
from
pla
where
he
had
been
lying
with
pino
s
division
to
whom
the
news
of
the
battle
had
arrived
very
late
he
brought
with
him
only
pino
s
divisional
cavalry
the
dragoons
of
napoleon
and
royal
chasseurs
but
had
ordered
the
rest
of
the
italians
to
follow
at
full
speed
when
they
should
have
got
together
as
pla
is
no
more
than
eight
miles
from
valls
it
was
expected
that
they
would
appear
within
the
space
of
three
hours
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
pino
did
not
draw
near
till
the
afternoon
one
of
his
brigades
which
lay
far
out
received
contradictory
orders
and
did
not
come
in
to
pla
till
past
midday
and
the
italian
general
would
not
move
till
it
had
rejoined
him
three
hours
were
wasted
by
this
and
meanwhile
the
battle
might
have
been
lost
vacani
iii
this
fact
is
mentioned
by
no
other
author
on
arriving
upon
the
field
with
the
italian
cavalry
cyr
rode
along
souham

line
steadied
it
and
displayed
the
horsemen
in
his
front
seeing
the
french
rallying
and
new
troops
arriving
to
their
aid
the
spanish
commander
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
cyr
had
come
up
with
very
heavy
reinforcements
and
instead
of
continuing
his
advance
or
pressing
on
his
march
toward
tarragona
suddenly
changed
his
whole
plan
of
operations
he
would
not
stand
to
be
attacked
in
the
plain
but
he
resolved
to
fight
a
defensive
action
on
the
heights
beyond
the
francoli
from
which
he
had
descended
in
the
morning
accordingly
first
his
baggage
then
his
main
body
and
lastly
his
vanguard
which
covered
the
retreat
of
the
rest
slowly
filed
back
over
the
bridge
of
goy
and
took
position
on
the
rolling
hills
to
the
east
here
reding
drew
them
up
in
two
lines
with
the
river
flowing
at
their
feet
as
a
front
defence
and
their
batteries
drawn
up
so
as
to
sweep
the
bridge
of
goy
and
the
fords
the
right
wing
was
covered
by
a
lateral
ravine
falling
into
the
francoli
the
left
facing
the
village
of
pixamoxons
was
somewhat
in
the
air
but
the
whole
position
if
long
was
good
and
eminently
defensible
cyr
observed
his
adversary
s
movement
with
joy
for
he
would
have
been
completely
foiled
if
reding
had
refused
to
fight
and
passed
on
toward
tarragona
knowing
the
spanish
troops
a
pitched
battle
with
superior
numbers
was
precisely
what
he
most
desired
accordingly
he
took
advantage
of
the
long
time
of
waiting
while
pino
s
division
was
slowly
drawing
near
the
field
to
rest
and
feed
souham
s
tired
troops
and
then
to
draw
them
up
facing
the
southern
half
of
reding
s
position
with
a
vacant
space
on
their
right
on
which
the
italians
were
to
take
up
their
ground
when
at
last
they
should
arrive
when
cyr
had
lain
for
nearly
three
hours
quiescent
at
the
foot
of
the
heights
and
no
reinforcements
had
yet
come
in
sight
reding
began
to
grow
anxious
he
had
as
he
now
realized
retired
with
unnecessary
haste
from
in
front
of
a
beaten
force
and
had
assumed
a
defensive
posture
when
he
should
have
pressed
the
attack
at
about
three
o
clock
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
had
committed
an
error
but
thinking
it
too
late
to
resume
the
fight
resolved
to
retire
on
tarragona
by
the
circuitous
route
which
passes
through
the
village
of
costanti
he
sent
back
general
marti
to
tarragona
to
bring
out
fresh
troops
from
the
garrison
to
join
him
at
that
point
and
issued
orders
that
the
army
should
retreat
at
dusk
he
might
perhaps
have
got
off
scatheless
if
he
had
moved
away
at
once
though
it
is
equally
possible
that
cyr
might
have
fallen
upon
his
rearguard
with
souham
s
division
and
done
him
some
damage
but
he
waited
for
the
dark
before
marching
partly
because
he
wished
to
rest
his
troops
who
were
desperately
fatigued
by
the
night
march
and
the
subsequent
combat
in
the
morning
partly
because
he
did
not
despair
of
fighting
a
successful
defensive
action
if
cyr
should
venture
to
cross
the
francoli
and
attack
him
accordingly
he
lingered
on
the
hillside
in
battle
array
waiting
for
the
darkness
arteche
makes
reding
deliver
a
second
attack
on
souham
in
the
early
afternoon
this
is
i
think
an
error
caused
by
a
misreading
of
cabanes
somewhat
confused
account
of
the
fight
from
which
it
might
be
possible
if
no
other
sources
existed
to
deduce
a
second
spanish
advance
but
cabanes
is
really
dealing
with
the
later
phases
of
the
first
combat
only
it
is
conclusive
that
neither
reding
himself
in
his
official
dispatch
cyr
doyle
nor
vacani
mention
any
engagement
in
the
early
afternoon
this
gave
cyr
his
chance
at
three
o
clock
pino
s
belated
division
had
begun
to
come
up
first
fontane
s
brigade
then
an
hour
and
a
half
later
that
of
mazzuchelli
whose
absence
from
pla
had
caused
all
the
delay
it
was
long
past
four
and
the
winter
afternoon
was
far
spent
when
cyr
had
at
last
got
all
his
troops
in
hand
allowing
barely
enough
time
for
the
italians
to
form
in
order
of
battle
cyr
now
led
forward
his
whole
army
to
the
banks
of
the
francoli
the
two
divisions
formed
four
heavy
columns
of
a
brigade
each
and
in
this
massive
formation
forded
the
river
and
advanced
uphill
driving
in
before
them
the
spanish
skirmishers
the
italian
dragoons
went
forward
in
the
interval
between
two
of
the
infantry
columns
the
french
cavalry
led
the
attack
on
the
extreme
right
near
the
bridge
of
goy
cyr
in
his
memoirs
makes
the
curious
statement
that
he
silenced
his
artillery
after
it
had
fired
only
three
rounds
lest
he
should
frighten
off
the
spaniards
before
he
could
reach
them
with
his
infantry
and
so
prevent
the
latter
from
closing
and
winning
as
decisive
a
victory
as
possible
one
is
almost
prone
to
doubt
the
story
and
to
suppose
that
the
cessation
of
fire
was
due
to
the
fear
of
killing
his
own
men
when
they
were
getting
close
to
the
spanish
line
arteche
puts
this
incident
too
early
in
the
fight
during
reding
s
supposed
second
attack
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
if
the
two
armies
would
actually
cross
bayonets
all
along
the
line
for
the
spaniards
stood
firm
and
opened
a
regular
and
fire
upon
the
advancing
columns
but
cyr
had
not
miscalculated
the
moral
effect
of
the
steady
approach
of
the
four
great
bodies
of
infantry
which
were
now
climbing
the
hill
and
drawing
near
to
reding
s
front
like
so
many
other
continental
troops
who
had
striven
on
earlier
to
bear
up
in
line
against
the
french
the
spaniards
could
not
find
heart
to
close
with
the
formidable
and
threatening
masses
which
were
rolling
in
upon
them
they
delivered
one
last
tremendous
discharge
at
yards
distance
and
then
when
they
saw
the
enemy
looming
through
the
smoke
and
closing
upon
them
broke
in
a
dozen
different
places
and
went
to
the
rear
in
helpless
disorder
sweeping
away
the
second
line
higher
up
the
hill
which
ought
to
have
sustained
them
the
only
actual
collision
was
on
the
extreme
left
near
the
bridge
of
goy
where
reding
himself
charged
with
his
staff
at
the
head
of
his
cavalry
in
a
vain
attempt
to
save
the
desperate
situation
he
was
met
in
full
career
by
the
french
dragoons
and
thoroughly
beaten
in
the
he
was
surrounded
three
of
his
were
wounded
and
taken
and
he
himself
only
cut
his
way
out
after
receiving
three
sabre
wounds
on
his
head
and
shoulders
which
ultimately
proved
fatal
among
them
was
an
english
officer
named
reid
if
there
had
not
been
many
steep
slopes
and
ravines
behind
the
spanish
position
nearly
the
whole
of
reding
s
army
must
have
perished
or
been
captured
but
the
was
so
difficult
that
the
majority
of
the
fugitives
got
away
though
many
were
overtaken
the
total
loss
of
the
spaniards
amounted
to
more
than
men
of
whom
nearly
half
were
prisoners
all
the
guns
of
the
defeated
army
all
its
baggage
and
several
stands
of

fell
into
the
hands
of

victors
the
french
lost
about
men
mostly
in
the

there
was
one
point
on
which
the
war
was
standing
still
and
where
the
french
arms
had
made
no
great
progress
since
the
battle

was
holding
out
with
the

tenacity
that

the
battle
of
tudela
had
been
fought
on
november
but
it
was
not
till
nearly
a
month
later
that
the
actual
siege
began
the
reason
for
this
delay
was
that
the
emperor
had
called
off
to
madrid
all
the
troops
which
had
taken
part
in
the
campaign
against
castaños
and
palafox
save
moncey

this

was
not

to

thrown

which
he
had
suffered
from

over

near

were
still
far
from
healed

served
as
the
excuse
for
his
retirement
moncey
therefore
resumed
on
november
the
charge
of
the
victorious
army
on
the
next
day
he
was
joined
by
ney
who
after
failing
to
intercept
castaños
in
the
mountains
had
descended
into
the
valley
of
the

with
marchand
and

and

advanced

appeared
in

with
all
their
troops
save
musnier
s
division
of
the

and
the
division
of
the
corps
lately
commanded
by
lagrange
which
had
followed
the
retreating
army
of
castaños
into
the
hills
on
the
road
to
calatayud
they
were
about
to
commence
the
investment
of

when
ney
received

from
the
emperor

from

bidding
him
leave
the
siege
to
moncey
and
cross
the
mountains
into
new
castile
with
all
the
troops
of
the
corps
he
was
to
find

heels
so
that
he
should
not
be
able
to

accordingly
the

marched
from

in

with
the
divisions
of
marchand
and
dessolles
and
the
cavalry
brigades

came
up

wounded
at

picked
up
maurice
mathieu
and
passed
the
mountains
into
new
castile
where
he
fell
into
the
emperor
s
sphere
of
operations
we
have
seen
that
he
took
a
prominent
part
in
the
pursuit
of
sir
john
moore
and
the
invasion
of
galicia
few
of
the
french
historians
mention
these
changes
but
they
are
quite
certain
on
the
division
maurice
mathieu
means
the
of

on
it
means
the
of
the
corps
moncey
meanwhile
was
left
in
front
of
saragossa
with
his
and
divisions
the
being
still
at
calatayud
this
force
consisted
of
no
more
than
battalions
about
men
and
was
far
too
weak
to
undertake
the
siege
the
marshal
was
informed
that
the
whole
corps
of
mortier
was
to
be
sent
to
his
aid
but
it
was
still
far
away
and
with
very
proper
caution
he
resolved
to
draw
back
and
wait
for
the
arrival
of
the
reinforcements
if
the
spaniards
got
to
know
of
his
condition
they
might
sally
out
from
saragossa
and
attack
him
with
more
than
men
moncey
therefore
drew
back
to
alagon
and
there
waited
for
the
arrival
of
the
duke
of
treviso
and
the
corps
it
was
not
till
december
that
he
was
able
to
present
himself
once
more
before
the
city
thus
saragossa
gained
four
weeks
of
respite
between
the
battle
of
tudela
and
the
commencement
of
the
actual
siege
this
reprieve
was
invaluable
to
palafox
and
the
aragonese
they
would
have
been
in
grave
danger
if
lannes
had
marched
on
and
assaulted
the
city
only
two
days
after
the
battle
and
before
the
routed
army
had
been
rallied
even
if
ney
and
moncey
had
been
permitted
to
begin
a
serious
attack
on
november
the
day
of
their
arrival
before
the
place
they
would
have
had
some
chance
of
success
but
their
sudden
retreat
raised
the
spirits
of
the
defenders
and
the
twenty
extra
days
of
preparation
thus
granted
to
them
sufficed
to
restore
them
to
full
confidence
and
to
their
belief
in
the
luck
of
saragossa
and
the
special
protection
vouchsafed
them
by
its
patron
saint
our
lady
of
the
pillar
napoleon
must
take
the
blame
for
all
the
consequences
of
ney
s
withdrawal
he
had
ordered
it
without
fully
realizing
the
fact
that
moncey
would
be
left
too
weak
to
commence
the
siege
probably
he
had
the
effect
of
the
defeat
of
tudela
on
the
army
of
aragon
for
the
failure
of
ney
s
attempt
to
surround
castaños
he
was
only
in
part
responsible
though
as
we
have
seen
he
had
sent
him
out
on
his
circular
march
two
days
too
late
but
to
draw
off
the
corps
to
new
castile
where
it
failed
to
do
any
good
before
the
corps
had
arrived
to
take
its
place
before
saragossa
was
clearly
a
blunder
see
vol
pp
palafox
made
admirable
use
of
the
unexpected
reprieve
that
had
been
granted
him
he
had
not
it
will
be
remembered
taken
part
in
person
in
the
battle
of
tudela
but
had
returned
to
his
head
quarters
on
the
night
before
that
disaster
he
was
occupied
in
organizing
a
reserve
to
take
the
field
in
support
of
his
two
divisions
already
at
the
front
when
the
sudden
influx
of
fugitives
into
saragossa
showed
him
what
had
occurred
in
the
course
of
the
next
two
days
there
poured
into
the
place
the
remains
of
the
divisions
of
o
neille
and
march
from
his
own
army
of
aragon
with
them
came
roca
s
men
who
properly
belonged
to
castaños
but
having
fought
in
the
right
wing
had
been
separated
from
the
main
body
of
the
andalusian
army
in
addition
fragments
of
many
other
regiments
of
the
army
of
the
centre
straggled
into
saragossa
at
least
or
men
of
the
wrecks
of
tudela
had
come
in
ere
four
days
were
expired
to
help
them
palafox
could
count
on
all
the
newly
organized
battalions
of
his
reserve
which
had
never
marched
out
to
join
the
field
army
they
amounted
to
some
or
men
but
many
of
the
regiments
had
only
lately
been
organized
and
had
not
received
their
uniforms
or
equipment
nor
was
this
all
several
belated
battalions
from
murcia
and
valencia
came
in
at
various
times
during
the
next
ten
days
so
that
long
ere
the
actual
siege
began
palafox
could
count
on
bayonets
and
sabres
of
more
or
less
regularly
organized
corps
he
had
in
addition
a
number
of
irregulars
armed
citizens
and
peasants
of
the
whose
numbers
it
is
impossible
to
fix
for
though
some
had
been
collected
in
or
volunteer
companies
others
fought
in
loose
bands
just
as
they
pleased
and
without
any
proper
organization
they
may
possibly
have
amounted
to
men
at
the
time
of
the
commencement
of
the
siege
but
so
many
were
drafted
into
the
local
aragonese
battalions
before
the
end
of
the
fighting
that
when
the
place
surrendered
in
february
there
were
less
than
a
thousand
of
these
unembodied
irregulars
under
arms
by
far
the
larger
part
of
roca
s
division
reached
saragossa
the
spanish
returns
show
that
men
joined
palafox
and
only
escaped
to
cuenca
with
the
rest
of
the
army
of
the
among
these
were
the
and
tiradores
de
murcia
the
regiment
of
florida
blanca
the
and
volunteers
of
murcia
and
the
volunteers
of
valencia
all
of
which
had
arrived
too
late
for
tudela
to
be
exact
was
the
number
of
as
opposed
to
in
the
return
of
the
garrison
on
see
arteche
appendix
to
vol
iv
but
it
was
not
so
much
for
the
reorganization
of
his
army
as
for
the
strengthening
of
his
fortifications
that
palafox
found
the
respite
during
the
first
three
weeks
of
december
profitable
during
the
first
siege
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
fortifications
of
saragossa
had
been
contemptible
from
the
engineer
s
point
of
view
the
flimsy
mediaeval
had
crumbled
away
at
the
first
fire
of
the
besiegers
and
the
real
defence
had
been
carried
out
behind
the
barricades
by
the
commencement
of
the
second
siege
everything
had
changed
and
the
city
was
covered
by
a
formidable
line
of
defences
executed
as
was
remarked
by
one
of
the
french
generals
with
more
zeal
and
energy
than
scientific
skill
but
presenting
nevertheless
most
serious
obstacles
to
the
besieger
see
cavallero
s
criticism
of
this
statement
of
rogniat
on
of
his
interesting
little
work
after
the
raising
of
the
first
siege
by
verdier
the
spaniards
had
been
for
some
time
in
a
state
of
such
confidence
and
exultation
that
they
imagined
that
there
was
no
need
for
further
defensive
precautions
the
next
campaign
was
to
be
fought
as
they
supposed
on
the
further
side
of
the
pyrenees
but
the
long
suspension
of
the
expected
advance
during
the
autumn
months
began
to
chill
their
spirits
and
as
the
year
drew
on
it
was
no
longer
reckoned
unpatriotic
or
cowardly
to
take
into
consideration
the
wisdom
of
strengthening
the
inland
fortresses
in
view
of
a
possible
return
of
the
french
in
september
colonel
san
genis
the
engineer
officer
who
had
worked
for
palafox
during
the
first
siege
received
permission
to
commence
a
series
of
regular
fortifications
for
saragossa
the
work
did
not
progress
rapidly
for
the
aragonese
had
not
as
yet
much
belief
in
the
possibility
that
they
might
be
called
on
once
again
to
defend
their
capital
san
genis
only
received
a
moderate
sum
of
money
and
the
right
to
requisition
men
of
over
from
the
city
and
the
surrounding
villages
the
labour
had
to
be
paid
and
therefore
the
labourers
were
few
the
new
works
were
sketched
out
rather
than
executed
things
progressed
with
a
leisurely
slowness
till
in
november
the
dangers
of
the
situation
began
to
be
appreciated
and
the
approach
of
the
french
reinforcements
drove
the
saragossans
to
greater
energy
but
it
was
only
the
thunderclap
of
tudela
that
really
alarmed
them
and
sent
soldiers
and
civilians
men
women
and
children
to
labour
with
feverish
haste
at
the
completion
of
the
new
lines
between
november
and
december
the
amount
of
work
that
was
carried
out
was
amazing
and
admirable
if
ney
and
moncey
had
been
allowed
to
commence
the
regular
siege
before
the
month
of
november
had
expired
they
would
have
found
the
whole
system
of
works
in
an
incomplete
condition
three
weeks
later
saragossa
had
been
converted
into
a
formidable
fortress
the
only
point
where
san
genis
scheme
had
not
been
fully
developed
was
the
monte
torrero
it
will
be
remembered
that
this
important
hill
whose
summit
lies
only
yards
from
the
walls
of
saragossa
overlooks
the
whole
city
and
had
been
chosen
during
the
first
siege
as
the
for
the
main
breaching
batteries
to
keep
the
french
from
this
commanding
position
was
most
important
and
the
spanish
engineer
had
intended
to
cover
the
whole
circuit
of
the
hill
with
a
large
entrenched
camp
protected
by
continuous
lines
of
earthworks
and
numerous
redoubts
with
the
canal
of
aragon
which
runs
under
its
southern
foot
as
a
wet
ditch
in
its
front
but
when
the
news
of
tudela
arrived
little
or
nothing
had
been
done
to
carry
out
this
scheme
the
fortification
of
the
city
had
absorbed
the
main
attention
of
the
aragonese
and
while
that
was
still
incomplete
the
monte
torrero
had
been
neglected
in
december
it
was
too
late
to
begin
the
building
of
three
or
four
miles
of
new
earthworks
and
in
consequence
nothing
was
constructed
on
the
suburban
hill
save
one
large
central
redoubt
and
two
small
works
serving
as
at
the
points
where
the
madrid
and
the
la
muela
roads
cross
the
canal
of
aragon
march
s
valencian
division
still
strong
was
told
off
for
the
defence
of
the
hill
but
had
no
continuous
line
of
works
to
cover
it
the
only
strength
of
the
position
lay
in
the
canal
which
runs
round
its
foot
but
this
was
not
very
broad
and
was
fordable
at
more
than
one
point
in
short
the
monte
torrero
constituted
an
outlying
defence
which
might
be
held
for
some
time
in
order
to
keep
the
besiegers
far
off
from
the
body
of
the
place
rather
than
an
integral
part
of
its
line
of
defence
it
was
on
the
works
of
saragossa
itself
that
the
energy
of
more
than
enthusiastic
labourers
military
and
civilian
had
been
expended
during
the
month
that
followed
tudela
the
total
accomplished
in
this
time
moves
our
respect
it
will
be
well
to
take
the
various
fronts
in
detail
on
the
western
front
from
the
ebro
to
the
huerba
there
had
been
in
august
nothing
more
than
a
weak
wall
many
parts
of
which
were
composed
of
the
of
convents
and
buildings
in
front
of
this
line
there
had
been
constructed
by
november
a
very
different
defence
a
solid
rampart
reveted
with
bricks
taken
from
ruined
houses
and
furnished
with
a
broad
terrace
for
artillery
and
a
ditch
feet
deep
now
covered
the
entire
western
side
of
the
city
the
convents
of
the
augustinians
and
the
trinitarians
which
had
been
outside
the
walls
during
the
earlier
siege
had
been
taken
into
this
new
and
served
as
bastions
in
it
there
being
a
space
yards
long
between
them
where
the
curtain
would
have
been
unprotected
by
flanking
fires
a
great
semicircular
battery
had
been
thrown
out
which
acted
as
a
third
bastion
on
this
side
strong
earthworks
had
also
been
built
up
to
cover
the
portillo
and
carmen
gates
as
an
outlying
fort
there
was
the
castle
of
the
aljafferia
which
had
received
extensive
repairs
and
was
connected
with
the
by
a
ditch
and
a
covered
way
it
would
completely
enfilade
any
attacks
made
on
the
part
of
the
new
wall
on
the
southern
front
of
the
defences
the
work
done
had
been
even
more
important
here
the
new
fortifications
had
been
carried
down
to
the
brink
of
the
ravine
of
the
huerba
so
as
to
make
that
stream
the
wet
ditch
of
the
town
two
great
redoubts
were
pushed
beyond
it
one
called
the
redoubt
of
our
lady
of
the
pillar
lay
at
the
bridge
outside
the
santa
engracia
gate
it
was
provided
with
a
deep
narrow
ditch
into
which
the
water
of
the
river
had
been
turned
and
armed
with
eight
guns
the
corresponding
fort
at
the
angle
of
the
town
was
made
by
fortifying
the
convent
of
san
josé
on
the
valencia
road
just
beyond
the
huerba
this
was
a
quadrangle
yards
long
by
eighty
broad
furnished
with
a
ditch
and
with
a
covered
way
with
palisades
cut
in
the
counterscarp
it
held
twelve
heavy
guns
and
a
garrison
of
no
less
than
men
between
san
josé
and
the
pillar
redoubt
the
old
town
wall
above
the
huerba
had
been
strengthened
and
thickened
and
several
new
batteries
had
been
built
upon
it
it
could
not
well
be
assailed
till
the
two
projecting
works
in
front
of
it
should
be
reduced
and
if
they
should
fall
it
stood
on
higher
ground
and
completely
commanded
their
sites
the
convent
of
santa
engracia
so
much
disputed
during
the
first
siege
had
been
turned
into
a
sort
of
fortress
and
heavily
armed
with
guns
of
position
on
the
eastern
front
of
the
city
from
san
josé
to
the
ebro
the
huerba
still
serves
as
a
ditch
to
the
place
but
is
not
so
steep
or
so
difficult
as
in
its
upper
course
here
the
suburb
of
the
tanneries
las
tenerias
where
that
stream
falls
into
the
ebro
had
been
turned
into
a
strong
projecting
redoubt
whose
fire
commanded
both
the
opposite
bank
of
the
ebro
on
one
side
and
the
lower
reaches
of
the
huerba
on
the
other
half
way
between
this
redoubt
and
san
josé
was
a
great
battery
generally
called
the
palafox
battery
at
the
porta
quemada
whose
fires
crossing
those
of
the
other
two
works
commanded
all
the
low
ground
outside
the
eastern
front
of
the
city
it
only
remains
to
speak
of
the
fortifications
of
the
transpontine
suburb
of
san
lazaro
this
was
by
nature
the
weakest
part
of
the
defences
as
the
suburb
is
built
in
low
marshy
ground
on
the
river
s
edge
here
deep
cuttings
had
been
made
and
filled
with
water
three
heavy
batteries
had
been
erected
and
the
convents
of
san
lazaro
and
jesus
had
been
strengthened
crenellated
and
loopholed
and
turned
into
forts
the
whole
of
these
works
were
joined
by
palisades
and
ditches
they
formed
a
great
requiring
a
garrison
of
men
as
an
additional
defence
for
the
flanks
of
the
suburb
three
or
four
gunboats
manned
by
sailors
brought
up
from
cartagena
had
been
launched
on
the
ebro
and
commanded
the
reach
of
the
river
which
runs
along
the
northern
side
of
the
city
yet
great
as
were
the
works
which
now
sheathed
the
body
of
saragossa
the
people
had
not
forgotten
the
moral
lesson
of
the
first
siege
when
her
walls
had
been
beaten
down
she
had
resisted
behind
her
barricades
and
the
solid
houses
of
her
narrow
streets
they
fully
realized
that
this
might
again
have
to
be
done
if
the
french
should
succeed
in
breaking
in
at
some
point
of
the
long
accordingly
every
preparation
was
made
for
street
fighting
houses
were
loopholed
and
communications
were
pierced
between
them
without
any
regard
for
private
property
or
convenience
windows
were
built
up
and
arrangements
made
for
the
speedy
and
solid
closing
of
all
doors
traverses
were
erected
in
the
streets
to
guard
as
far
as
was
possible
against
the
dangers
of
a
bombardment
and
an
elaborate
system
of
barricades
arranged
in
proper
tactical
relation
to
each
other
was
sketched
out
the
walls
might
be
broken
but
the
people
boasted
that
the
kernel
should
be
harder
than
the
shell
outside
the
city
where
the
olive
groves
and
suburban
villas
and
summer
houses
had
given
much
cover
to
the
french
during
the
first
siege
a
clean
sweep
had
been
made
of
every
stone
and
stick
for
yards
around
the
defences
the
trees
were
felled
and
dragged
into
the
city
to
be
cut
up
into
palisades
the
bricks
and
stones
were
carried
off
to
revet
the
new
ramparts
and
ditches
the
once
fertile
and
picturesque
were
left
bald
and
bare
and
could
be
perfectly
well
searched
by
the
cannon
from
the
walls
so
that
the
enemy
had
to
contrive
all
his
cover
by
pick
and
shovel
or
gabion
and
fascine
the
soldiery
whose
spirits
had
been
much
dashed
by
the
disaster
of
tudela
soon
picked
up
their
courage
when
they
noted
the
enthusiasm
of
the
citizens
and
the
strength
of
the
defences
indeed
it
was
dangerous
for
any
man
to
show
outward
signs
of
doubt
or
fear
for
the
aragonese
had
been
wrought
up
to
a
pitch
of
hysterical
patriotism
which
made
them
look
upon
faintheartedness
as
treason
palafox
himself
did
his
best
to
keep
down
riots
and
assassinations
but
his
followers
were
always
stimulating
him
to
apply
martial
law
in
its
most
rigorous
form
a
high
gallows
was
erected
in
the
middle
of
the
coso
and
short
shrift
was
given
to
any
man
convicted
of
attempted
desertion
disobedience
to
orders
or
cowardice
delations
were
innumerable
and
the
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
preserving
from
the
popular
fury
even
persons
whom
he
believed
to
be
innocent
the
most
that
he
could
do
for
them
was
to
shut
them
up
in
the
prisons
of
the
aljafferia
and
to
defer
their
trial
till
the
siege
should
be
over
the
fact
was
that
palafox
was
well
aware
that
his
power
rested
on
the
unlimited
confidence
reposed
on
him
by
the
people
and
was
therefore
bent
on
crossing
their
desires
as
little
as
he
could
help
he
was
careful
to
take
counsel
not
only
with
his
military
subordinates
but
with
all
those
who
had
power
in
the
streets
hence
came
the
prominence
which
is
assigned
in
all
the
narratives
of
the
siege
to
obscure
persons
such
as
the
priests
don
basilio
the
s
chaplain
and
santiago
sass
and
to
the
demagogues
tio
jorge
and
tio
they
represented
public
opinion
and
had
to
be
conciliated
it
is
going
too
far
to
say
with
napier
that
a
regular
reign
of
terror
prevailed
in
saragossa
throughout
the
second
siege
and
that
palafox
was
no
more
than
a
puppet
whose
strings
were
pulled
by
fanatical
friars
and
bloodthirsty
but
it
is
clear
that
the
s
dictatorial
power
was
only
preserved
by
a
careful
observation
of
every
gust
of
popular
feeling
and
that
the
acts
of
his
subordinates
were
often
reckless
and
cruel
the
soldiers
disliked
the
fanatical
citizens
the
work
of
colonel
cavallero
the
engineer
officer
who
has
left
the
best
spanish
narrative
of
the
siege
is
full
of
this
feeling
he
sums
up
the
situation
by
writing
that
the
agents
of
the
sometimes
abused
their
power
everything
was

cavallero
pp
belmas
translates
the
paragraph
almost
word
for
word
in
ii
of
his
work
without
acknowledgement
palafox
knew
well
how
to
deal
with
his
followers
he
kept
himself
always
before
their
eyes
his
activity
was
unceasing
his
supervision
was
felt
in
every
department
his
unending
series
of
eloquent
if
somewhat
bombastic
proclamations
was
well
suited
to
rouse
their
enthusiasm
he
displayed
even
to
ostentation
a
confidence
which
he
did
not
always
feel
because
he
saw
that
the
strength
of
the
defence
lay
in
the
fact
that
the
aragonese
were
convinced
in
the
certainty
of
their
own
triumph
the
first
doubt
as
to
ultimate
success
would
dull
their
courage
and
weaken
their
arms
we
can
not
blame
him
under
the
circumstances
if
he
concealed
from
them
everything
that
was
likely
to
damp
their
ardour
and
allowed
them
to
believe
everything
that
would
keep
up
their
spirits
meanwhile
he
did
not
neglect
the
practical
side
of
the
defence
the
best
testimony
to
his
capacity
is
the
careful
accumulation
which
he
made
of
all
the
stores
and
material
needed
for
a
long
siege
alone
among
all
the
spanish
garrisons
of
the
war
that
of
saragossa
never
suffered
from
hunger
nor
from
want
of
resources
it
was
the
pestilence
not
starvation
which
was
destined
to
prove
the
ruin
of
the
defence
before
the
french
investment
began
palafox
had
gathered
in
six
months
provisions
for
men
the
garrison
was
doubled
by
the
arrival
of
the
routed
army
from
tudela
yet
still
there
was
food
for
three
months
for
the
military
the
citizens
had
been
directed
to
lay
in
private
stocks
and
to
feed
themselves
this
they
had
done
and
it
was
not
till
the
end
of
the
siege
that
they
began
to
run
short
of
comestibles
even
when
the
place
fell
there
were
still
large
quantities
of
corn
maize
salt
fish
oil
brandy
and
forage
for
horses
in
the
magazines
only
fresh
meat
had
failed
and
the
spaniard
is
never
a
great
consumer
of
that
commodity
military
stores
had
been
prepared
in
vast
quantities
there
was
an
ample
stock
of
sandbags
of
timber
for
palisading
of
iron
work
and
spare
fittings
for
artillery
instead
of
gabions
the
garrison
used
the
large
wicker
baskets
employed
for
the
vintage
which
were
available
in
profusion
of
artillery
there
were
some
pieces
in
the
place
but
too
many
of
them
were
of
small
calibre
only
about
sixty
were
or
heavier
of
these
more
than
half
were
french
pieces
abandoned
by
verdier
in
august
in
his
or
fished
out
of
the
canal
into
which
he
had
thrown
them
of
there
was
also
an
ample
provision
a
great
part
like
the
were
spoil
taken
in
the
deserted
camp
of
the
french
in
august
shells
on
the
other
hand
were
very
deficient
and
the
workmen
of
the
local
arsenal
could
not
manufacture
them
satisfactorily
the
powder
was
made
in
the
place
throughout
the
siege
the
accident
in
july
when
the
great
magazine
in
the
seminary
blew
up
with
such
disastrous
results
had
induced
palafox
to
order
that
no
great
central
store
should
be
made
but
that
the
sulphur
saltpetre
and
charcoal
should
be
kept
apart
and
compounded
daily
in
quantities
sufficient
for
all
requirements
so
many
thousand
civilians
were
kept
at
work
on
that
this
plan
never
failed
and
no
great
explosions
took
place
during
the
second
siege
cavallero
pp
and
it
will
be
remembered
that
want
of
muskets
had
been
one
of
the
chief
hindrances
of
the
aragonese
during
the
operations
in
july
and
august
it
was
not
felt
in
december
and
january
for
not
only
had
palafox
collected
a
large
store
of
small
arms
during
the
autumn
to
equip
his
reserves
but
he
received
just
before
the
investment
began
a
large
convoy
of
british
muskets
sent
up
from
tarragona
by
colonel
doyle
who
had
gone
down
to
the
coast
by
the
s
desire
to
hurry
on
their
transport
as
the
siege
went
on
the
mortality
among
the
garrison
was
so
great
that
the
stock
of
muskets
more
than
sufficed
for
those
who
were
in
a
state
to
bear
arms
such
were
the
preparations
which
were
made
to
receive
the
french
when
they
should
finally
present
themselves
in
front
of
the
walls
all
had
been
done
save
in
one
matter
to
enable
the
city
to
make
the
best
defence
possible
under
the
circumstances
the
single
omission
was
to
provide
for
a
field
force
beyond
the
walls
capable
of
harassing
the
besiegers
from
without
and
of
cutting
their
communications
with
their
base
from
his
men
palafox
ought
to
have
detached
a
strong
division
with
orders
to
base
itself
upon
upper
aragon
and
keep
the
french
in
constant
fear
as
to
their
supplies
and
their
touch
with
tudela
and
pampeluna
ten
thousand
men
could
easily
have
been
spared
and
the
mischief
that
they
might
have
done
was
incalculable
the
city
had
more
defenders
than
were
needed
in
the
open
country
on
the
other
hand
there
was
no
nucleus
left
for
further
resistance
almost
every
available
man
had
been
sent
up
to
saragossa
with
the
exception
of
lazan
s
division
in
catalonia
and
of
three
other
battalions
the
whole
of
the
men
raised
by
the
kingdom
of
aragon
were
inside
the
walls
outside
there
remained
nothing
but
unorganized
bands
of
peasants
to
keep
the
field
and
molest
the
besiegers
the
only
help
from
without
that
was
given
to
the
city
was
that
supplied
by
lazan
s
small
force
when
it
was
withdrawn
from
catalonia
in
january
and
men
could
do
nothing
against
two
french
army
corps
even
as
it
was
the
french
had
to
tell
off
the
best
part
of
two
divisions
to
guard
their
communications
what
could
they
have
done
if
there
had
been
a
solid
body
of
men
ranging
the
mountains
and
descending
at
every
favourable
opportunity
to
fall
upon
some
post
on
the
long
line
by
which
the
besiegers
drew
their
food
and
munitions
from
their
base
the
battalions
of
alcañiz
tauste
and
de
the
last
were
at
jaca
and
afterwards
served
with
blake
s
army
at
maria
and
belchite
they
are
wrongly
put
in
saragossa
in
arteche
iv
appendix
it
would
seem
that
the
neglect
of
palafox
to
provide
for
this
necessary
detachment
arose
from
three
causes
the
first
was
his
want
of
real
strategical
insight
which
had
been
amply
displayed
during
the
autumn
when
he
was
always
urging
on
his
colleagues
his
ridiculous
plan
for
surrounding
the
french
army
by
an
impossible
march
into
navarre
and
the
pyrenees
the
second
was
his
conviction
enough
in
itself
that
his
troops
would
do
much
better
behind
walls
than
in
the
open
the
third
was
a
strong
belief
that
the
siege
would
be
raised
not
by
any
operations
from
without
but
by
the
rigours
of
the
winter
in
average
years
the
months
of
january
and
february
are
tempestuous
and
rainy
in
aragon
the
low
ground
about
saragossa
is
often
inundated
even
if
the
enemy
were
not
drowned
out
like
the
besiegers
of
leyden
in
palafox
thought
that
they
would
find
impossible
in
the
constant
downpour
and
would
be
so
much
thinned
by
dysentery
and
rheumatism
that
they
would
have
to
draw
back
from
their
camps
and
raise
the
siege
unfortunately
for
him
the
winter
turned
out
exceptionally
mild
and
what
was
worse
exceptionally
dry
the
french
had
not
to
suffer
from
the
awful
deluge
which
in
galicia
during
this
same
month
was
rendering
the
retreat
of
sir
john
moore
so
miserable
the
rain
did
no
more
than
send
many
of
the
besiegers
to
hospital
it
never
stopped
their
advance
or
flooded
their
trenches
see
the
remarks
in
defence
of
palafox
in
arteche
iv
when
palafox
had
nearly
completed
his
defences
the
works
on
the
monte
torrero
alone
were
still
hopelessly
behindhand
the
french
at
last
began
to
move
up
against
him
on
december
marshal
mortier
arrived
at
tudela
with
the
whole
of
the
corps
veterans
from
the
german
garrisons
who
had
not
yet
fired
a
shot
in
spain
their
ranks
were
so
full
that
though
only
two
divisions
or
battalions
formed
the
corps
it
counted
bayonets
it
had
also
a
brigade
of
two
regiments
of
hussars
and
chasseurs
as
with
a
strength
of
sabres
the
condition
of
moncey
s
corps
was
much
less
satisfactory
it
was
mainly
composed
of
relics
of
the
original
army
of
spain
of
the
conscripts
formed
into
provisional
regiments
with
whom
napoleon
had
at
first
intended
to
conquer
the
peninsula
its
other
troops
almost
without
exception
had
taken
part
in
the
first
siege
of
saragossa
under
verdier
a
not
very
cheerful
or
inspiriting
preparation
for
the
second
leaguer
all
the
regiments
had
been
thinned
by
severe
sickness
in
the
autumn
on
october
they
had
already
men
in
hospital
far
the
largest
figure
shown
by
any
of
the
french
corps
in
spain
the
number
had
largely
increased
as
the
winter
had
drawn
on
and
the
battalions
had
grown
so
weak
that
moncey
consolidated
his
four
divisions
into
three
during
his
halt
at
alagon
the
whole
of
the
division
was
distributed
between
the
and
so
as
to
bring
the
others
up
to
a
decent
strength
on
december
the
battalions
only
made
up
effective
men
for
the
siege
while
more
than
lay
sick
some
with
the
army
some
in
the
base
hospitals
at
pampeluna
the
health
of
the
corps
grew
progressively
worse
in
january
till
at
last
in
the
middle
days
of
the
siege
it
had
men
with
the
colours
and
no
less
than
sick
we
find
the
french
generals
complaining
that
one
division
of
the
corps
was
almost
as
strong
and
effective
at
this
time
as
the
whole
combined
force
of
the
corps
nevertheless
these
weary
and
troops
had
to
take
in
charge
the
main
part
of
the
siege
operations
the
and
legion
of
reserve
were
all
formed
in
this
way
these
were
the
and
of
the
vistula
and
of
the
line
and
one
battalion
each
of
the
and
léger
during
the
twenty
days
of
his
halt
at
alagon
moncey
had
employed
his
sappers
and
many
of
his
infantry
in
the
manufacture
of
gabions
and
sandbags
for
the
projected
siege
he
was
continually
receiving
convoys
of
heavy
artillery
and
ammunition
from
pampeluna
and
when
mortier
came
up
on
december
had
a
sufficiency
of
material
collected
for
the
commencement
of
the
leaguer
the
two
marshals
moved
on
together
on
that
day
and
marched
eastward
towards
saragossa
with
the
whole
of
their
forces
save
that
four
battalions
were
left
to
guard
the
camp
and
dépôts
at
alagon
and
three
more
at
tudela
to
keep
open
the
pampeluna
road
gazan
s
division
crossed
the
ebro
opposite
tauste
to
invest
the
transpontine
suburb
of
saragossa
the
rest
of
the
army
kept
to
the
right
bank
late
in
the
evening
both
columns
came
in
sight
of
the
city
they
mustered
after
deducting
the
troops
left
behind
about
infantry
cavalry
and
sappers
and
artillerymen
they
had
sixty
over
and
above
the
belonging
to
the
of
mortier
and
moncey
the
provision
of
artillery
was
copious
far
more
than
the
french
had
turned
against
many
of
the
fortresses
of
germany
the
emperor
was
determined
that
saragossa
should
be
well
battered
and
had
told
off
an
extra
proportion
of
engineers
against
the
place
entrusting
the
general
charge
of
the
work
to
his
general
lacoste
one
of
the
most
distinguished
officers
of
the
scientific
corps
see
the
table
in
belmas
ii
these
were
all
detached
from
moncey
the
alagon
garrison
consisted
of
four
battalions
of
the
legion
of

strong
at

were
three

of

when
the
reinvestment

established

at

mortier
with

took
post
at

opposite
the
western

moncey
marching
round
the
place
ranged
grandjean

troops
opposite

on
the
southern
front
of
the
defences
and
morlot
further
east
near
the
mouth
of
the
huerba
his
other
division
that
of
musnier
formed
the
central
reserve
and
guarded
the
artillery
and
the
magazines
the
spaniards
made
no
attempt
to
delay
the
completion
of
the
investment
and
kept
quiet
within
their
walls
on
the
next
morning
the
actual
siege
began
it
was
destined
to
last
from
december
to
february
and
may
be
divided
into
three
sections
the
first
comprises
the
operations
against
the
spanish
outworks
and
terminates
with
the
capture
of
the
two
great
beyond
the
huerba
the
forts
of
san
josé
and
our
lady
of
the
pillar
it
lasted
down
to
january
the
second
period
includes
the
time
during
which
the
besiegers
attacked
and
finally
broke
through
the
main
of
the
city
it
lasts
from
january
to
january
the
third
section
consists
of
the
after
the
walls
had
been
pierced
and
ends
with
the
fall
of
saragossa
on
february
having
reconnoitred
the
whole
circuit
of
the
spanish
defences
on
the
very
evening
of
their
arrival
before
the
city
december
moncey
and
mortier
recognized
that
their
first
task
must
be
to
evict
the
spaniards
from
the
monte
torrero
the
one
piece
of
dominating
ground
in
the
whole
region
of
operations
and
the
spot
from
which
saragossa
could
be
most
effectively
attacked
they
were
rejoiced
to
see
that
the
broad
hill
was
not
protected
by
any
continuous
line
of
entrenchments
but
was
merely
crowned
by
a
large
open
redoubt
and
defended
in
front
by
the
two
small
on
the
canal
of
aragon
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
an
attempt
to
storm
it
by
main
force
this
was
to
be
made
on
the
following
morning
at
the
same
time
gazan
on
the
left
bank
of
the
ebro
was
ordered
to
assault
the
suburb
of
san
lazaro
here
the
marshals
had
underrated
the
strength
of
the
spanish
position
which
lay
in
such
low
ground
and
was
so
difficult
to
make
out
that
it
presented
to
the
observer
from
a
distance
an
aspect
of
weakness
that
was
far
from
the
reality
at
eight
on
the
morning
of
december
three
french
batteries
placed
in
favourable
advanced
positions
began
to
shell
the
redoubts
on
the
monte
torrero
with
satisfactory
results
as
they
dismounted
some
of
the
defender
s
guns
and
exploded
a
small
dépôt
of
reserve
ammunition
an
hour
later
the
infantry
came
into
action
moncey
had
told
off
for
the
assault
the
divisions
of
morlot
and
grandjean
twenty
battalions
in
all
the
former
attacked
the
eastern
front
of
the
position
fording
the
canal
and
assailing
the
on
the
valencia
road
from
the
flank
the
latter
which
had
passed
the
canal
far
outside
the
spanish
lines
and
operated
between
it
and
the
huerba
attacked
the
slopes
of
the
hill
the
defence
was
weak
and
when
a
brigade
of
grandjean
s
men
pushed
in
between
the
main
redoubt
on
the
crest
and
the
huerba
and
took
the
western
part
of
the
spanish
line
in
the
rear
the
day
was
won
march
s
battalions
wavered
all
along
the
line
and
as
his
reserves
could
not
be
induced
to
fall
upon
the
french
advance
the
valencian
general
withdrew
his
whole
division
into
the
city
abandoning
the

insignificant
considering
the

the

of

that

had
misbehaved
and
they
were
not

wrong
palafox
had
great
difficulty
in
protecting

personal
conduct
had
been
unimpeachable
from

wrath
of

wished
to
make

things
had
gone
very
differently
at
the
other
point
where
the

had
tried
to
break
down
the
outer
defences
of
the
city
the
attack
on
the

had
been
allotted
to

this
was
a
very
formidable
force

were
bent
on

that
they
had

they

slight
mistake
in

delivered

hours
after

of

six

strong
advanced
against
the
northern
and
eastern
fronts
of
the
defences
of
the
suburb
the
spaniards
were
holding
as
an
outwork
a
large
building
called
the
archbishop

gazan
s
men
carried
at
the
first
rush
killing
or
capturing
men
of
a
swiss
battalion
which
held
it
they
then
pushed
forward
towards
the
inner
fortifications
but
were
taken
in
flank
by
a
heavy
artillery
fire
from
a
redoubt
which
they
had
overlooked
this
caused
them
to
swerve
towards
the
barcelona
road
where
they
got
possession
of
a
house
close
under
the
convent
of
jesus
and
threatened
to
cut
off
the
garrison
of
that
stronghold
from
the
rest
of
the
defenders
of
the
suburb
at
this
moment
a
disgraceful
panic
seized
the
defenders
of
the
san
lazaro
convent
which
lay
directly
in
front
of
the
assailants
they
abandoned
their
post
and
began
to
fly
across
the
bridge
into
saragossa
but
palafox
came
up
in
person
with
a
reserve
and
reoccupied
the
abandoned
post
he
then
ordered
a
sortie
against
the
buildings
which
the
french
had
seized
and
succeeded
in
driving
them
out
and
compelling
them
to
retire
into
the
open
ground
gazan
doubted
for
a
moment
whether
he
should
not
send
in
his
second
brigade
to
renew
the
attack
for
the
six
battalions
that
had
borne
the
brunt
of
the
first
fighting
had
now
fallen
into
complete
disorder
but
remembering
that
if
this
force
failed
to
break
into
the
suburb
he
had
no
reserves
left
and
that
palafox
might
bring
over
the
bridge
as
many
reinforcements
as
he
chose
the
french
general
resolved
not
to
push
the
assault
any
further
he
drew
back
and
retired
behind
the
gallego
stream
where
he
threw
up
entrenchments
to
cover
himself
completely
abandoning
the
offensive
for
two
or
three
days
he
did
not
dare
to
move
expecting
to
be
attacked
at
any
moment
by
the
garrison
a
sudden
rise
of
the
ebro
had
cut
off
his
communication
with
moncey
and
he
could
neither
send
the
marshal
an
account
of
his
check
nor
get
any
orders
from
him
his
was
severe
thirty
officers
and
men
killed
and

somewhat

including
the
swiss
who
were
cut
to
pieces
at

s
tower
belmas
calls
it

but
palafox
in
his
dispatch
gives
the
name
above
suizos
de
an
officer
of
sappers
named
henri
and
one
of
his
privates
tried
to
reopen
communication
by
swimming
the
river
on
an
night
they
reached
the
further
bank
but
died
of
exhaustion
among
the
reeds
where
their
corpses
were
found
next
morning
thus
the
message
was
never
delivered
belmas
ii
palafox
next
morning
issued
a
proclamation
extolling
the
valour
shown
in
the
defence
of
the
suburb
treating
the
loss
of
the
monte
torrero
as
insignificant
and
exaggerating
the
losses
of
the
french
the
saragossans
were
rather
encouraged
than
otherwise
by
the
results
of
the
day
s
fighting
and
spoke
as
if
they
had
merely
lost
an
outwork
by
the
unsteadiness
of
march
s
valencians
while
the
main
hostile
attack
had
been
repulsed
but
it
is
clear
that
the
capture
of
the
dominating
heights
south
of
the
city
was
an
gain
to
the
french
without
the
monte
torrero
they
could
never
have
pressed
the
siege
home
as
to
the
failure
at
the
suburb
it
came
from
attacking
with
headlong
courage
an
entrenched
position
that
had
not
been
properly
reconnoitred
the
assault
should
never
have
been
delivered
without
artillery
preparation
and
was
a
grave
mistake
but
clearly
mortier
s
corps
had
yet
to
learn
what
the
spaniards
were
like
and
to
realize
that
to
turn
them
out
from
behind
walls
and
ditches
was
not
the
light
task
that
they
supposed
moncey
so
thoroughly
miscalculated
the
general
effect
of
the
fighting
upon
the
minds
of
the
spaniards
that
next
morning
he
sent
in
to
palafox
a
flag
of
truce
with
an
officer
bearing
a
formal
demand
for
the
surrender
of
the
city
madrid
had
fallen
he
wrote
saragossa
invested
on
all
sides
had
not
the
force
to
resist
two
complete
d
he
trusted
that
the
would
spare
the
beautiful
and
wealthy
capital
of
aragon
the
horrors
of
a
siege
ample
blood
had
already
been
shed
enough
misfortunes
already
suffered
by
palafox
replied
in
the
strain
that
might
have
been
expected
from
him
the
man
who
only
wishes
to
die
with
honour
in
defence
of
his
country
cares
nothing
about
his
position
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
found
that
his
own
was
eminently
favourable
and
encouraging
in
the
first
siege
he
had
held
out
for
days
with
a
garrison
far
inferior
to
that
now
under
his
command
was
it
likely
that
he
would
surrender
when
he
had
as
many
troops
as
his
besiegers
looking
at
the
results
of
the
fighting
on
the
previous
day
when
the
assailants
had
suffered
so
severely
in
front
of
san
lazaro
he
thought
that
he
would
be
quite
as
well
justified
in
proposing
to
the
marshal
that
the
besieging
army
should
surrender
to
spare
further
effusion
of
blood
as
the
latter
had
been
to
make
such
a
proposition
to
him
if
madrid
had
fallen
madrid
must
have
been
sold
but
he
begged
for
leave
to
doubt
the
truth
of
the
rumour
even
at
the
worst
madrid
was
but
a
town
like
any
other
its
fate
had
no
influence
on
saragossa
the
two
letters
may
be
found
in
full
in
the
appendices
to
belmas
vol
ii
having
received
such
an
answer
moncey
had
only
to
set
to
work
as
fast
as
possible
his
general
lacoste
after
making
a
thorough
survey
of
the
defences
pronounced
in
favour
of
choosing
two
fronts
of
attack
both
starting
on
the
monte
torrero
and
directed
the
one
against
the
fort
of
san
josé
and
the
other
against
that
of
the
pillar
these
projecting
works
would
have
to
be
carried
before
any
attempt
could
be
made
against
the
inner
of
the
town
at
the
same
time
lacoste
ordered
a
third
attack
which
he
did
not
propose
to
press
home
to
be
made
on
the
castle
of
the
aljafferia
on
the
west
side
of
the
town
it
was
only
intended
to
distract
the
attention
of
the
spaniards
from
the
points
of
real
danger
on
the
further
bank
of
the
ebro
gazan
s
division
was
directed
to
move
forward
again
and
to
entrench
itself
across
all
the
three
roads
which
issue
from
the
suburb
and
lead
respectively
to
lerida
jaca
and
monzon
he
was
not
to
attack
but
merely
to
blockade
the
northern
exits
of
saragossa
communications
with
him
were
established
by
means
of
a
bridge
of
boats
and
pontoons
laid
above
the
town
gazan
succeeded
in
shortening
the
front
which
he
had
to
protect
against
sorties
by
letting
the
water
of
the
ebro
into
the
fields
along
its
banks
where
it
caused
inundations
on
each
of
his
flanks
on
the
the
preliminary
works
of
the
siege
began
approaches
and
covered
ways
being
constructed
leading
down
from
the
monte
torrero
to
the
spots
from
which
lacoste
intended
to
commence
the
first
parallels
of
the
two
attacks
on
the
pillar
and
san
josé
preparations
of
a
similar
sort
were
commenced
for
the
false
attack
on
the
left
opposite
the
aljafferia
six
days
were
occupied
in
these
works
and
in
the
bringing
up
of
the
heavy
artillery
destined
to
arm
the
from
tudela
the
guns
had
to
come
by
road
as
the
spaniards
had
destroyed
all
the
barges
on
the
canal
of
aragon
and
blown
up
many
of
its
locks
it
was
not
till
some
time
later
that
the
french
succeeded
in
reopening
the
navigation
by
replacing
the
and
building
large
punts
and
floats
for
the
carriage
of
guns
or
munitions
just
before
the
first
parallel
was
opened
marshal
moncey
was
recalled
to
madrid
december
the
emperor
being
apparently
discontented
with
his
delays
in
the
early
part
of
the
month
he
was
replaced
in
command
of
the
corps
by
junot
whose
old
divisions
had
been
made
over
as
we
have
seen
in
the
first
volume
to
soult
s
corps
this
change
made
mortier
the
senior
officer
of
the
besieging
army
but
he
and
junot
seem
to
have
worked
more
as
partners
than
as
commander
and
subordinate
junot
in
his
report
to
the
emperor
on
the
state
in
which
he
found
the
troops
enlarges
at
great
length
on
the
deplorable
condition
of
the
corps
many
of
the
battalions
had
never
received
their
winter
clothing
hundreds
entered
the
hospitals
every
day
and
there
was
no
corresponding
outflow
of
convalescents
no
less
than
men
had
died
in
the
base
hospital
at
pampeluna
in
november
and
the
figure
for
december
would
be
worse
he
doubted
if
there
were
infantry
under
arms
in
his
three
divisions
here
he
exaggerated
somewhat
for
even
a
fortnight
later
the
returns
show
that
his
present
under
arms
after
deducting
all
detachments
and
sick
were
still
over
bayonets
on
january
therefore
there
must
have
been
he
asked
for
money
reinforcements
and
a
supply
of
officers
the
commissioned
ranks
of
his
corps
showing
a
terrible
proportion
of
gaps
on
the
other
hand
he
conceded
that
the
corps
was
in
excellent
condition
its
veterans
suffering
far
less
from
disease
than
his
own
conscripts
either
of
gazan
s
and
suchet
s
divisions
was
by
itself
as
strong
as
any
two
of
the
divisions
of
the
corps
junot
to
berthier
on
the
night
of
the
thirtieth
within
twelve
hours
of
moncey
s
departure
the
first
parallel
was
opened
both
in
the
attack
towards
san
josé
and
in
that
opposite
the
pillar
fort
when
the
design
of
the
besiegers
became
evident
palafox
made
three
sallies
on
the
but
apparently
more
with
the
object
of
reconnoitring
the
and
distracting
the
workers
than
with
any
hope
of
breaking
the
french
lines
for
there
were
not
more
than
men
employed
in
any
of
the
three
columns
which
delivered
the
sorties
the
assault
on
the
trenches
before
san
josé
was
not
pressed
home
but
opposite
the
false
attack
at
the
aljafferia
the
fighting
was
more
lively
the
french
outposts
were
all
driven
in
with
loss
and
a
squadron
of
cavalry
which
had
slipped
out
from
the
sancho
gate
close
to
the
ebro
surprised
and
sabred
thirty
men
of
a
picket
on
the
left
of
the
french
lines
palafox
made
the
most
of
this
small
success
in
a
magniloquent
proclamation
published
on
the
succeeding
day
he
should
have
sent
out
men
instead
of
if
he
intended
to
get
any
profit
out
of
his
sorties
an
attack
delivered
with
such
a
force
on
some
one
point
of
the
lines
must
have
paralysed
the
siege
operations
and
might
have
proved
disastrous
to
the
french
meanwhile
the
besiegers
undisturbed
by
these
sallies
pushed
forward
their
works
on
the
northern
slopes
of
the
monte
torrero
the
attack
opposite
san
josé
got
forward
much
faster
than
that
against
the
pillar
its
second
parallel
was
commenced
on
january
and
its
batteries
were
all
ready
to
open
by
the
ninth
the
other
attack
was
handicapped
by
the
fact
that
the
ground
sloped
down
more
rapidly
towards
the
huerba
so
that
the
trenches
had
to
be
made
much
deeper
and
pushed
forward
in
perpetual
zigzags
in
order
to
avoid
being
searched
by
the
plunging
fire
from
the
spanish
batteries
on
the
other
side
of
the
stream
in
the
of
the
town
to
get
a
flanking
position
against
the
pillar
redoubt
the
left
attack
was
continued
by
another
line
of
trenches
beyond
the
huerba
after
it
has
made
its
sharp
turn
to
the
south
before
the
engineers
had
completed
their
work
and
long
ere
the
breaching
batteries
were
ready
a
great
strain
was
thrown
upon
the
besiegers
by
fresh
orders
from
napoleon
on
january
marshal
mortier
received
a
dispatch
bidding
him
march
out
to
calatayud
with
one
of
his
two
divisions
and
open
up
the
direct
communication
with
madrid
accordingly
he
departed
with
the
two
strong
brigades
of
suchet
s
division
bayonets
this
withdrawal
threw
much
harder
work
on
the
remainder
of
the
army
junot
was
left
with
not
much
more
than
men
including
the
artillerymen
to
maintain
the
investment
of
the
whole
city
he
was
forced
to
spread
out
the
corps
on
a
very
thin
line
in
order
to
occupy
all
the
posts
from
which
suchet
s
battalions
had
been
withdrawn
morlot
s
division
came
down
from
the
monte
torrero
to
occupy
the
ground
which
suchet
had
evacuated
musnier
had
to
cover
the
whole
of
the
hill
and
to
support
both
the
lines
of
approach
on
which
the
engineers
were
busy
grandjean
s
division
remained
on
its
old
front
facing
the
eastern
side
of
the
city
and
gazan
still
blockaded
the
suburb
beyond
the
ebro
as
the
general
had
still
men
there
were
only
bayonets
and
the
artillery
available
for
the
siege
a
force
far
too
small
to
maintain
a
front
nearly
four
miles
long
if
palafox
had
dared
to
make
a
general
sortie
with
all
his
disposable
men
junot
s
position
would
have
been
more
than
hazardous
but
the
contented
himself
with
making
numerous
and
useless
sallies
on
a
petty
scale
sending
out
the
most
reckless
and
determined
of
his
men
to
waste
themselves
in
bickering
with
the
guards
of
the
trenches
when
he
should
have
saved
them
to
head
a
general
assault
in
force
upon
some
weak
point
of
the
siege
lines
the
diaries
and
narratives
of
the
french
officers
who
served
at
saragossa
are
full
of
anecdotes
of
the
frantic
courage
shown
by
the
besieged
generally
to
no
purpose
one
of
the
strangest
has
been
preserved
by
the
very
prosaic
engineer
belmas
who
tells
how
a
priest
in
his
robes
came
out
on
january
in
front
of
gazan
s
lines
and
walked
among
the
bullets
to
within
fifty
yards
of
the
trenches
when
he
preached
with
great
unction
for
some
minutes
his
crucifix
in
his
hand
to
the
effect
that
the
french
had
a
bad
cause
and
were
drawing
down
god
s
anger
upon
themselves
to
the
credit
of
his
audience
it
must
be
said
that
they
let
him
go
off
alive
contenting
themselves
with
firing
over

suffered
little
belmas
says
that
only
one
officer
and
ten
men
fell
though
two
guns
in
the
most
advanced
battery
were
disabled
the
loss
of

on

was
numbered
by
hundreds
more
being
slain
by
the
fall
of

by

and
shells
of
the
assailants
at
nightfall
palafox
withdrew
most
of
the
guns
from
the
convent
but
replaced
the
decimated
garrison
by
three
fresh
battalions
it
was
clear
that
the
work
would
fall
next
day
unless
the
besiegers
were
driven
off
from
their
batteries
at
therefore
men
made
a
desperate
sally
to
spike
the
guns
but
the
french
were
alert
and
had
brought
up
two
close
to
the

repressed

the

entered
without

partly
by

to

partly
by
using
a
small
bridge
of
planks
across
the

which
the
spaniards
had
forgotten
to
remove
they
only
lost

former
was

the

more
than
from

but
between
them
ran
the
deep

of

from

the

were
busily
engaged

up

no

the

had
not
been
entirely
reconstructed
as
on
the
western
front
of
the
city
but
only
patched
up
and
strengthened
with
earthworks
at
intervals
the
masonry
of
the
convent
of
santa
engracia
suffered
most
and
began
to
fall
in
large
patches
palafox
saw
that
the
would
be
pierced
ere
long
and
that
would
be
the
next
stage
of
the
siege
accordingly
he
set
the
whole
civil
population
to
work
on
constructing
barricades
across
the
streets
and
lanes
of
the
part
of
the
city
in
the
rear
of
the
threatened
points
and
turned
every
block
of
houses
into
an
independent
fort
by
building
up
all
the
doorways
and
windows
facing
towards
the
enemy
the
spirits
of
the
garrison
were
still
high
and
the
had
done
his
best
to
keep
them
up
by
issuing
gazettes
containing
very
roseate
accounts
of
the
state
of
affairs
in
the
outer
world
his
communication
with
the
open
country
was
not
completely
cut
for
thrice
he
had
been
able
to
send
boats
down
the
ebro
which
took
their
chance
of
running
past
the
french
batteries
at
night
and
always
succeeded
one
of
these
boats
had
carried
the
s
younger
brother
francisco
palafox
who
had
orders
to
appeal
to
the
catalans
for
help
and
to

the
peasants
of

occasional

also
got

from

in

to
fall
upon
the

palafox
not
only
let
this
be
known
but
published
in
his
official
gazette
some
utterly
unfounded
rumours
which
the
courier
had
brought
reding
it
was
said
had
beaten

the
duke
of

had

glorious
news
the
church
bells
were
set
ringing
the
artillery
fired
a
general
salute
and
military
music
paraded
the
town
these
phenomena
were
perfectly
audible
to
the
besiegers
and
caused
them
many
searchings
of
heart
for
they
could
not
guess
what
event
the
saragossans
could
be
celebrating
was
this
a
distorted
rumour
of
the
combat
of
cacabellos
and
the
death
of

the

s
on

needed
all
the
encouragement
that
could
be
given
to
them
for
after
the
middle
of
january
the
stress
of
the
siege
began
to
be
felt
very
heavily
food
was
not
wanting
for
excepting
fresh
meat
and
vegetables
everything
was
still
procurable
in
abundance
but
cold
and
overcrowding
were
beginning
to
cause
epidemic
disorders
the
greater
part
of
the
civil
population
had
taken
refuge
in
their
cellars
when
the
bombardment
began
and
after
a
few
days
spent
in
those
dark
and
damp
retreats
from
which
they
only
issued
at
night
or
when
they
were
called
on
for
labour
at
the
fortifications
began
to
develop
fevers
and
dysentery
this
was
inevitable
for
in
most
of
the
dwellings
from
twenty
to
forty
persons
of
all
ages
were
crowded
in
mere
holes
no
more
than
seven
feet
high
and
almost
unprovided
with
ventilation
where
they
lived
ate
and
slept
packed
together
and
with
no
care
for
sanitary
precautions
the
malignant
fevers
bred
in
these
refuges
soon
spread
to
the
garrison
though
under
cover
the
soldiery
were
destitute
of
warm
clothing
especially
the
murcian
battalions
and
could
not
procure
enough
firewood
to
cook
their
meals
by
january
there
were
sick
among
the
regular
troops
and
every
day
the
wastage
to
the
hospital
grew
more
and
more
noticeable
many
officers
of
note
had
already
fallen
in
the
useless
sorties
and
in
especial
a
grave
loss
had
been
suffered
on
january
when
colonel
san
genis
the
chief
engineer
of
the
besieged
and
the
designer
of
the
whole
of
the
defences
of
the
city
was
killed
on
the
ramparts
of
the
palafox
battery
as
he
was
directing
the
fire
against
the
new
entrenchment
which
the
french
were
throwing
up
across
the
gorge
of
the
san
josé
fort
he
had
no
competent
successor
as
a
general
director
for
his
underlings
had
no
grasp
of
and
were
only
good
at
details
they
built
batteries
and
barricades
and
ran
mines
in
pure
opportunism
without
any
comprehensive
scheme
of
defence
before
their
eyes
for
the
description
of
these
miserable
and
most
insalubrious
refuges

on

days

was

on
the
french
meanwhile
were
very
active
though
the
constant
increase
of
sickness
in
the
corps
was
daily
thinning
the
regiments
till
the
proportion
of
men
stricken
down
by
fever
was
hardly
less
than
that
among
the
spaniards
on
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
lacoste
began
to
contrive
a
descent
into
the
bottom
of
the
ravine
of
the
huerba
by
a
series
of
zigzags
pushed
forward
from
the
third
parallel
both
in
the
direction
of
santa
engracia
and
in
that
of
the
palafox
battery
the
latter
was
repeatedly
silenced
by
the
advanced
batteries
of
the
besiegers
but
they
could
not
subdue
the
incessant
musketry
fire
from
windows
and
loopholes
which
swept
the
whole
bed
of
the
huerba
and
rendered
the
work
at
the
head
of
the
new
sap
most
difficult
and
deadly
sometimes
it
had
to
be
completely
abandoned
because
of
the
plunging
fire
from
the
city
yet
it
was
always
resumed
after
a
time
the
french
found
that
their
best
and
easiest
work
was
done
in
the
early
morning
when
for
day
after
day
a
dense
fog
rose
from
the
ebro
which
rendered
it
impossible
for
the
spaniards
to
see
what
was
going
on
or
to
aim
with
any
certainty
at
the
entrenchments
irritated
at
the
steady
if
slow
progress
of
the
enemy
palafox
launched
on
the
afternoon
of
january
the
most
desperate
sortie
that
his
army
had
yet
essayed
against
the
advanced
works
of
the
french
at
four
o
clock
on
that
day
three
columns
dashed
out
and
attacked
the
line
of
trenches
one
as
a
blind
was
sent
out
opposite
the
aljafferia
to
distract
the
attention
of
morlot
s
division
from
the
main
sally
the
other
two
were
serious
attacks
but
both
made
with
too
small
numbers
apparently
no
more
than
picked
men
in
each
the
column
became
hotly
engaged
with
the
trenches
to
the
north
of
san
josé
and
got
no
further
forward
than
a
house
a
little
beyond
the
huerba
from
which
they
expelled
a
french
post
but
the
force
carried
out
a
very
bold
programme
crossing
the
huerba
below
santa
engracia
they
broke
through
the
third
parallel
and
then
made
a
dash
at
two
in
the
second
parallel
which
had
particularly
annoyed
the
defence
on
that
morning
the
commander
of
the
sortie
mariano
galindo
a
captain
of
the
volunteers
of
aragon
led
his
men
so
straight
that
they
rushed
in
with
the
bayonet
on
the
first
battery
and
spiked
both
its
pieces
they
were
making
for
the
second
when
they
were
overwhelmed
by
the
trench
guard
and
by
reinforcements
hurrying
up
from
musnier
s
camp
of
a
hundred
men
who
had
gone
forward
with
galindo
from
the
third
parallel
twelve
were
killed
and
thirty
including
their
brave
leader
taken
prisoners
the
french
stated
their
loss
at
no
more
than
six
killed
and
five
wounded
a
figure
that
seems
suspiciously
low
considering
that
the
first
line
of
trenches
had
been
stormed
by
the
assailants
and
a
battery
in
the
second
line
captured
and
disabled
galindo
had
gone
forward
more
than
yards
into
the
very
middle
of
the
french
works
before
he
was
checked
and
surrounded
it
was
a
very
gallant
exploit
but
once
more
we
are
constrained
to
ask
why
palafox
told
off
for
it
no
more
than
a
mere
handful
of
men
what
would
have
happened
had
he
thrown
a
solid
column
of
men
upon
the
instead
of
a
few
hundred
volunteers
belmas
ii
oddly
enough
belmas
places
this
sortie
on
on
which
day
as
arteche
shows
none
of
the
spanish
accounts
speak
of
a
sortie
while
the
latter
give
at
great
length
details
of
the
fighting
on
the
probably
the
spanish
date
is
the
correct
one
on
the
the
day
before
galindo
s
sortie
junot
was
superseded
in
command
of
the
besieging
army
by
lannes
who
had
been
restored
to
health
by
two
months
holiday
and
was
now
himself
again
he
arrived
just
in
time
to
take
charge
of
the
important
task
of
storming
the
main
for
which
junot
s
preparations
were
now
far
advanced
but
though
the
siege
operations
looked
not
unpromising
he
found
the
situation
grave
and
dangerous
belmas
and
the
other
french
historians
describe
this
as
the
most
critical
epoch
of
the
whole
saragossan
episode
the
fact
was
that
at
last
there
were
beginning
to
be
signs
of
movement
in
the
open
country
of
aragon
during
the
month
that
had
elapsed
since
the
siege
began
the
peasantry
had
been
given
time
to
draw
together
francisco
palafox
after
escaping
from
the
city
had
gone
to
mequinenza
and
was
arming
the
local
levies
with
muskets
procured
from
catalonia
he
had
already
a
great
horde
assembled
in
the
direction
of
alcañiz
on
the
other
bank
of
the
ebro
colonel
perena
had
been
organizing
a
force
at
huesca
from
northern
aragon
and
the
of
the
pyrenees
lastly
it
was
known
that
lazan
was
on
his
way
from
gerona
to
aid
his
brothers
and
had
brought
to
lerida
his
division
of
men
a
comparatively
body
of
troops
which
had
been
under
arms
since
october
even
far
back
on
the
way
to
pampeluna
insurgents
had
gathered
in
the
sierra
de
moncayo
and
were
threatening
the
important
post
of
tudela
by

hitherto
these

had
looked
dangerous
but
had
done
no
actual
harm
general
wathier
with
the
cavalry
of
the
corps
had
scoured
the
southern
bank
of
the
ebro
and
kept
off
the
insurgents
but
now
they
were
pressing
closer
in
and
on
january
a
battalion
which
gazan
had
sent
out
to
drive
away
perena
s
levies
had
been
checked
and
beaten
off
at
perdiguera
only
twelve
miles
from
the
camp
of
the
besiegers
lannes
could
not
fail
to
see
that
if
he
committed
himself
to
the
final
assault
on
saragossa
and
entangled
the
corps
in
he
might
find
himself
assailed
from
the
rear
on
all
points
of
his
lines
there
were
no
troops
whatever
in
front
of
saragossa
to
form
a
to
beat
off
the
insurgents
if
they
should
come
down
upon
his
camps
while
he
was
storming
the
city
for
the
corps
and
gazan
s
division
had
now
only
infantry
for
the
conduct
of
the
siege
accordingly
the
marshal
resolved
to
undo
the
emperor
s
arrangements
for
keeping
up
the
line
of
communication
with
madrid
and
to
draw
in
mortier
with
suchet
s
strong
and
intact
division
from
calatayud
where
he
had
been
lying
for
the
last
three
weeks
this
was
the
only
possible
force
which
he
could
use
to
provide
himself
with
a
covering
army
the
touch
with
madrid
a
thing
of
comparatively
minor
importance
had
to
be
sacrificed
except
so
far
as
it
could
be
kept
up
by
the
division
of
dessolles
which
had
now
come
back
from
the
pursuit
of
sir
john
moore
and
had
pushed
detachments
back
to
its
old
posts
at
sigüenza
and
guadalajara
mortier
therefore
evacuated
calatayud
by
the
orders
of
lannes
and
came
back
to
the
ebro
passing
behind
the
besieging
army
he
crossed
the
river
and
took
post
at
perdiguera
with
men
facing
the
levies
of
perena
in
the
direction
of
huesca
it
was
only
when
he
had
made
certain
of
having
this
powerful
reinforcement
close
at
hand
ready
to
deal
with
any
interference
from
without
that
lannes
dared
to
proceed
with
the
assault
at
the
same
time
that
mortier
arrived
at
perdiguera
he
sent
out
wathier
with
two
battalions
and
two
regiments
of
cavalry
to
deal
with
the
insurgents
of
the
lower
ebro
where
francisco
palafox
had
been
busy
four
or
five
thousand
peasants
with
one
regiment
of
aragonese
volunteers
tried
to
resist
this
small
column
but
were
beaten
on
the
in
front
of
the
town
of
alcañiz
which
fell
into
wathier
s
hands
and
with
it
sheep
and
sacks
of
flour
which
had
been
collected
for
the
revictualling
of
saragossa
in
case
the
investment
should
be
broken
they
were
a
welcome
windfall
to
the
besieging
army
where
food
was
none
too
plentiful
since
the
plain
country
where
it
lay
encamped
had
now
been
eaten
bare
and
convoys
of
food
from
tudela
and
pampeluna
were
rare
and
inadequate
on
january
the
french
had
succeeded
in
pushing
three
approaches
across
the
huerba
and
were
firmly
established
under
its
northern
bank
two
days
later
they
made
lodgements
in
ruins
cellars
and
low
walls
where
buildings
had
been
pulled
down
in
the
narrow
space
between
the
town
wall
and
the
river
bank
below
the
palafox
battery
the
cannon
of
the
defenders
could
only
act
intermittently
every
night
the
parapets
were
repaired
but
every
morning
after
a
few
hours
of
artillery
duel
the
spanish
guns
were
silenced
by
the
dreadful
converging
fire
poured
in
upon
them
meanwhile
palafox
was
heaping
barricade
upon
barricade
in
the
quarters
behind
the
threatened
points
and
fortifying
the
houses
and
convents
which
connected
them
the
final
crisis
arrived
on
the
there
were
now
three
practicable
breaches
two
were
on
the
side
of
the
palafox
battery
one
in
the
convent
of
santa
engracia
to
storm
the
first
and
second
lannes
told
off
the
light
companies
of
the
first
brigade
of
grandjean
s
division
to
the
third
was
allotted
the
regiment
of
the
vistula
from
musnier
s
division
heavy
supports
lay
behind
them
in
the
third
parallel
with
orders
to
rush
in
if
the
storming
parties
should
prove
successful
the
assault
was
delivered
with
great
dash
and
swiftness
at
noon
on
the
on
two
points
it
was
successful
at
the
most
northern
breach
the
assailants
reached
the
summit
of
the
wall
but
could
not
get
down
into
the
city
on
account
of
the
storm
of
musketry
from
barricades
and
houses
that
swept
the
gap
into
which
they
had
advanced
they
merely
made
a
lodgement
in
the
breach
itself
and
could
penetrate
no
further
but
in
the
central
breach
close
beneath
the
palafox
battery
the
voltigeurs
not
only
passed
the
walls
but
seized
the
oil
mill
which
abutted
on
them
and
a
triangular
block
of
houses
projecting
into
the
town
at
the
santa
engracia
breach
they
were
even
more
fortunate
the
poles
carried
the
convent
with
their
first
rush
its
outer
wall
had
been
battered
down
for
a
breadth
of
thirty
yard
and
entering
there
the
stormers
drove
out
the
spaniards
from
the
interior
buildings
of
the
place
and
got
into
the
large
square
which
lies
behind
it
where
they
seized
the
capuchin
nunnery
thus
a
considerable
wedge
was
driven
through
the
and
the
spaniards
had
to
evacuate
the
walls
for
some
little
distance
on
each
side
of
santa
engracia
from
the
stretch
to
the
west
of
that
convent
they
were
driven
out
by
an
unpremeditated
assault
of
musnier
s
supports
who
ran
out
from
the
trenches
on
the
left
of
the
huerba
and
escaladed
the
dilapidated
wall
in
front
of
them
when
they
saw
the
garrison
drawing
back
on
account
of
the
flanking
fire
from
santa
engracia
they
got
possession
of
the
whole
outer
as
far
as
the
trinitarian
convent
by
the
carmen
gate
these
successes
were
bought
at
the
moderate
loss
of
men
of
whom
fell
in
the
fighting
on
the
santa
engracia
front
the
spaniards
lost
somewhat
more
including
a
few
prisoners
in
any
ordinary
siege
the
day
would
have
settled
the
fate
of
the
place
for
the
besiegers
had
broken
through
the
in
two
places
and
though
the
space
seized
inside
the
palafox
battery
was
not
large
yet
on
each
side
of
santa
engracia
the
assailants
had
penetrated
so
far
that
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
walls
was
in
their
possession
but
saragossa
was
not
as
other
places
and
the
garrison
were
perfectly
prepared
with
a
new
front
of
defence
composed
of
batteries
and
crenellated
houses
in
rear
of
the
lost
positions
two
wedges
one
large
and
one
small
had
been
driven
into
the
town
but
they
had
to
be
broadened
and
driven
further
in
if
they
were
to
have
any
effect
on
the
therefore
a
new
stage
of
the
siege
began
and
the
which
was
to
last
for
days
more
had
its
commencement
lannes
had
heard
from
those
who
had
served
under
verdier
in
the
first
siege
of
the
deplorable
slaughter
and
repeated
repulses
that
had
followed
the
attempt
to
carry
by
main
force
the
internal
defences
of
the
city
to
hurl
solid
columns
of
stormers
at
the
barricades
and
the
crenellated
houses
was
not
his
intention
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
advance
by
sap
and
mine
as
if
he
were
dealing
with
regular
fortifications
his
plan
was
to
use
each
block
of
houses
that
he
gained
as
a
base
for
the
attack
upon
the
next
and
never
to
send
in
the
infantry
with
the
bayonet
till
he
had
breached
by
artillery
or
by
mines
the
building
against
which
the
assault
was
directed
this
form
of
attack
was
bound
to
be
slow
but
it
had
the
great
merit
of
costing
comparatively
little
in
the
way
of
casualties
the
fact
was
that
the
marshal
had
not
the
numbers
which
would
justify
him
in
wasting
lives
by
assaults
which
might
or
might
not
be
successful
but
which
were
certain
to
prove
very
bloody
the
whole
third
corps
as
we
have
already
seen
did
not
now
furnish
much
more
than
bayonets
while
gazan
s
men
were
all
occupied
in
watching
the
suburb
and
suchet
s
lay
far
out
as
a
covering
corps
set
to
watch
perena
and
lazan
there
was
no
one
single
dominating
position
in
the
city
whose
occupation
was
likely
to
constrain
the
besieged
to
surrender
the
whole
town
is
built
on
a
level
and
its
churches
and
convents
formed
so
many
forts
each
of
which
was
defensible
in
itself
and
could
not
be
reduced
save
by
a
direct
attack
all
that
could
be
done
was
to
endeavour
to
capture
them
one
by
one
in
the
hope
that
at
last
the
saragossans
would
grow
tired
of
their
hopeless
resistance
and
consent
to
surrender
when
they
realized
that
things
had
gone
so
far
that
they
could
only
protract
but
could
not
finally
beat
off
the
slow
advance
of
the
besieging
army
the
work
of
the
french
therefore
consisted
in
spreading
out
from
their
two
separate
lodgements
on
the
eastern
and
southern
sides
of
the
city
with
the
simple
object
of
gaining
ground
each
day
and
of
driving
the
spaniards
back
towards
the
centre
of
the
place
on
the
right
attack
the
most
important
objective
of
the
besiegers
was
the
block
of
monastic
buildings
to
the
north
of
the
palafox
battery
the
twin
convents
of
san
augustin
and
santa
monica
which
lay
along
the
northern
side
of
the
small
wedge
that
they
had
driven
into
the
corner
of
the
town
as
these
buildings
lay
on
ground
slightly
higher
than
that
which
the
french
had
occupied
it
was
difficult
to
attack
them
by
means
of
mines
but
an
intense
converging
fire
was
brought
to
bear
upon
them
both
from
batteries
outside
the
walls
playing
across
the
huerba
and
by
guns
brought
inside
the
captured
angle
of
the
the
outer
walls
of
santa
monica
were
soon
a
mass
of
ruins
nevertheless
the
first
attack
on
it
january
was
beaten
off
and
it
was
only
on
the
next
day
after
hours
more
of
furious
bombardment
that
grandjean
s
men
succeeded
in
storming
first
the
convent
and
then
its
church
after
a
furious
fight
with
the
defenders
after
establishing
themselves
in
santa
monica
the
french
were
able
to
capture
some
of
the
adjoining
houses
and
to
turn
their
attention
against
its
neighbour
san
augustin
they
ran
two
mines
under
it
and
at
the
same
time
battered
it
heavily
from
the
external
batteries
beyond
the
huerba
on
february
i
the
explosion
took
place
it
opened
a
breach
in
the
east
end
of
the
convent
church
and
the
storming
party
entering
by
the
sacristy
got
possession
of
the
choir
chapels
and
the
high
altar
but
the
spaniards
rallied
in
the
nave
ran
a
barricade
of
chairs
and
benches
across
it
and
held
their
own
for
some
time
firing
down
from
the
pulpit
and
the
organ
loft
with
effect
some
climbed
up
into
the
roof
and
picked
off
the
french
through
the
holes
which
the
bombardment
had
left
in
the
ceiling
for
some
hours
this
strange
indoor
battle
raged
within
the
spacious
church
but
at
last
the
french
carried
the
nave
and
at
night
only
the
belfry
remained
untaken
its
little
garrison
pelted
the
french
with
grenades
all
day
and
saved
themselves
at
dusk
by
a
sudden
and
unexpected
dash
through
the
enemy
in
the
first
flush
of
success
after
san
augustin
had
been
stormed
the
regiment
from
grandjean
s
division
tried
to
push
on
through
the
streets
towards
the
centre
of
the
town
they
captured
several
barricades
and
houses
and
struggled
on
till
they
had
nearly
reached
the
coso
but
this
sort
of
fighting
was
always
dangerous
in
saragossa
the
citizens
kept
up
such
a
fierce
fire
from
their
windows
and
swarmed
out
against
the
flanks
of
the
column
in
such
numbers
that
the
had
to
give
back
lost
all
that
it
had
taken
beyond
san
augustin
and
left
dead
and
wounded
behind
even
the
formal
official
reports
of
the
french
engineers
speak
with
respect
of
the
courage
shown
by
the
besieged
on
this
day
the
houses
which
they
had
lost
in
the
afternoon
they
retook
in
the
dusk
by
an
extraordinary
device
finding
the
french
solidly
barricaded
in
them
and
proof
against
any
attack
from
the
street
hundreds
of
the
defenders
climbed
upon
the
roofs
tore
up
the
tiles
and
entered
by
the
garrets
from
which
they
descended
and
drove
out
the
invaders
by
a
series
of
charges
which
cleared
story
after
story
many
monks
and
still
more
women
were
seen
among
the
armed
crowds
which
swept
the
assailants
back
towards
santa
monica
it
was
especially
noticed
that
the
civilians
did
far
more
of
the
fighting
than
the
soldiers
this
was
their
own
special
battle
report
of
general
laval
the
trenches
this
day
to
lannes
in
appendix
xxvi
of
belmas
vol
ii
cf
von
brandt
irritated
at
his
losses
on
this
day
lannes
issued
a
general
order
expressly
forbidding
any
attempts
to
storm
houses
and
barricades
by
main
force
after
an
explosion
the
troops
were
to
seize
the
building
that
had
been
shattered
and
to
cover
themselves
in
it
they
were
not
to
go
forward
and
fall
upon
intact
defences
further
to
the
front
while
the
struggle
was
raging
thus
fiercely
from
january
to
february
in
the
eastern
area
of
there
had
been
a
no
less
desperate
series
of
combats
all
around
santa
engracia
on
the
southern
front
of
attack
here
musnier
s
division
was
endeavouring
to
drive
the
spaniards
out
of
the
blocks
of
houses
to
the
right
and
left
of
the
captured
convent
they
worked
almost
entirely
by
mines
running
tunnels
forward
from
beneath
the
convent
to
blow
down
the
walls
of
the
adjoining
dwellings
but
even
when
the
mines
had
gutted
the
doomed
buildings
it
was
not
easy
to
seize
them
the
few
men
who
survived
the
explosion
did
not
fly
but
held
out
among
the
ruins
and
had
to
be
bayonetted
by
the
assailants
who
rushed
out
from
the
convent
to
occupy
the
new
lodgements
time
after
time
the
defenders
though
perfectly
conscious
that
they
were
being
undermined
and
that
by
staying
on
guard
they
were
courting
certain
death
refused
to
evacuate
the
threatened
houses
or
to
retire
into
safety
hence
their
losses
were
awful
but
the
french
too
suffered
not
a
little
while
pushing
forward
to
occupy
each
building
as
it
was
cleared
by
the
explosion
the
constant
rain
of
musket
balls
from
roofs
and
church
towers
searched
out
the
ruins
in
which
they
had
to
effect
their
lodgements
and
many
of
the
assailants
fell
before
they
could
cover
themselves
among
the
débris
on
the
the
spaniards
made
a
sudden
rush
from
the
misericordia
buildings
to
recover
the
trinitarian
convent
the
most
western
point
on
the
which
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
french
at
the
assault
of
the
they
charged
in
upon
it
with
the
greatest
fury
and
blew
open
the
gate
with
a
gun
which
they
dragged
up
by
hand
to
the
very
threshold
but
the
french
had
built
up
the
whole
entrance
with
sandbags
which
held
even
when
the
doors
had
been
shattered
and
after
persisting
for
some
time
in
a
fruitless
attempt
to
break
in
the
saragossans
had
to
retire
foiled
and
greatly
thinned
in
numbers
on
the
following
day
february
the
french
began
to
move
forward
from
santa
engracia
towards
the
coso
always
clearing
their
way
by
explosions
and
risking
as
few
men
as
possible
nevertheless
they
could
not
always
keep
under
cover
and
this
day
they
suffered
a
severe
loss
their
chief
engineer
general
lacoste
was
shot
through
the
head
while
reconnoitring
from
a
window
the
houses
against
which
his
next
attack
was
to
be
directed
he
was
succeeded
in
command
by
colonel
rogniat
one
of
the
french
historians
of
the
siege
that
officer
as
he
tells
us
discovered
that
his
sappers
were
using
too
large
charges
of
powder
which
destroyed
the
roofs
and
four
walls
of
each
house
that
they
undermined
so
that
the
infantry
who
followed
had
no
cover
when
they
first
took
possession
he
therefore
ordered
the
substitution
of
smaller
measures
of
powder
so
as
to
throw
down
only
parts
of
the
wall
of
the
building
nearest
to
the
french
lines
and
to
leave
the
roof
and
the
outer
walls
uninjured
in
this
way
it
was
much
more
easy
to
establish
a
lodgement
since
the
were
covered
the
moment
that
they
had
dashed
into
the
shattered
shell
the
only
plan
which
the
spaniards
could
devise
against
this
method
of
procedure
was
to
set
fire
to
the
ruins
and
to
prevent
the
entry
of
the
assailants
by
burning
down
all
that
was
left
of
the
house
as
the
buildings
of
saragossa
contained
little
woodwork
and
were
not
very
combustible
the
besieged
daubed
the
walls
with
tar
and
resin
to
make
them
blaze
the
better
when
an
explosion
had
taken
place
the
surviving
defenders
set
fire
to
the
débris
of
floors
and
roofs
before
retiring
in
this
way
they
sometimes
kept
the
french
back
for
as
much
as
two
days
since
they
could
not
make
their
lodgement
till
the
cinders
had
time
to
cool
countermining
against
the
french
approaches
was
often
tried
but
seldom
with
success
for
there
were
no
trained
miners
in
the
city
the
one
battalion
of
sappers
which
palafox
possessed
had
been
formed
from
the
workmen
of
the
canal
of
aragon
who
had
no
experience
in
subterranean
work
on
the
other
hand
the
french
had
three
whole
companies
of
miners
beside
eight
more
of
sappers
who
were
almost
as
useful
in
the
demolition
of
the
city
they
maintained
a
distinct
ascendent
underground
though
they
not
unfrequently
lost
men
in
the
repeated
combats
with
knife
and
pistol
which
ensued
when
mine
and
countermine
met
and
the
two
sides
fought
for
the
possession
of
each
other

of

death

him
when
he
and
his
lalobe
were
simultaneously
shot
through
the
head

they
peered
out
of
a
side
window
where
they
thought
themselves
unobserved

ceilings

the
first
week
of
february
was
now
drawing
to
its
close
and
the
advance
of
the
french
into
the
city
though
steady
had
been
extremely
slow
every
little
block
of
five
or
six
houses
cost
a
day
to
break
up
and
another
to
entrench
the
waste
of
life
though
not
excessive
was
more
than
lannes
could
really
afford
and
he
waited
impatiently
but
in
vain
for
any
signs
that
the
obstinacy
of
the
defence
was
slackening
but
though
he
could
not
see
it
the
garrison
were
being
tried
far
more
hardly
than
the
besiegers
it
was
not
so
much
the
loss
by
fire
and
sword
that
was
ruining
them
as
the
silent
ravages
of
the
epidemic
fevers
since
the
french
had
got
within
the
walls
and
the
bombardment
of
the
city
was
being
carried
on
from
a
shorter
range
than
before
the
civilian
population
had
been
forced
to
cling
more
closely
than
ever
to
its
fetid
cellars
and
the
infectious
fever
which
had
appeared
in
january
was
developing
at
the
most
fearful
rate
living
under
such
insanitary
conditions
and
feeding
on
flour
and
salt
fish
for
the
vegetables
had
long
been
exhausted
the
saragossans
had
no
strength
to
bear
up
against
the
typhus
whole
families
died
off
and
their
bodies
lay
forgotten
tainting
the
air
and
spreading
the
contagion
even
where
there
were
survivors
they
could
not
easily
dispose
of
the
dead
for
the
urban
cemeteries
were
gorged
and
burials
took
place
in
trenches
hastily
opened
in
streets
or
gardens
outside
the
churches
there
were
hundreds
of
corpses
some
coffined
others
rolled
in
shrouds
or
sheets
waiting
in
rows
for
the
last
services
of
the
church
which
the
surviving
clergy
were
too
few
to
read
the
shells
from
the
incessant
bombardment
were
continually
falling
in
these
open
spaces
and
tearing
the
dead
to
pieces
ere
the
siege
was
over
there
was
a
mass
of
mutilated
and
decaying
bodies
heaped
in
front
of
every
church
door
hundreds
more
lay
in
the
debatable
ground
for
which
the
spaniards
and
french
were
contending
and
the
whole
town
reeked
with
contagion
the
weather
was
generally
still
and
warm
for
the
time
of
year
with
a
thick
fog
rising
every
morning
from
the
low
ground
by
the
ebro
the
smoke
from
the
burning
houses
lay
low
over
the
place
and
the
air
was
thick
with
the
mingled
fumes
of
fire
and
pestilence
if
it
nauseated
the
french
who
had
the
open
country
behind
them
and
were
relieved
by
regiments
at
intervals
and
allowed
a
rest
in
their
camps
outside
the
walls
it
was
far
more
terrible
to
the
spaniards
the
death
rate
rose
as
february
drew
on
from
up
to
and
even
a
day
the
morning
state
of
the
garrison
on
the
fourth
day
of
the
month
showed
sick
and
wounded
and
only
men
under
arms
as
the
total
had
been
when
the
siege
began
nearly
men
must
already
have
perished
by
the
sword
or
disease
the
civil
population
containing
so
many
women
children
and
aged
persons
was
of
course
dying
at
a
much
quicker
rate
yet
the
place
held
out
for
sixteen
days
longer
palafox
himself
was
struck
down
by
the
fever
but
still
issued
orders
from
his
bed
and
poured
out
a
string
of
hysterical
proclamations
in
which
his
delirium
is
clearly
apparent
the
terrible
situation
of
the
saragossans
was
to
a
large
extent
concealed
from
the
besiegers
who
only
saw
the
line
of
desperate
which
met
them
in
every
house
and
could
only
guess
at
the
death
and
desolation
that
lay
behind
every
french
bears
record
to
the
low
spirits
of
the
troops
who
were
compelled
to
fight
in
the
long
series
of
explosions
and
assaults
which
filled
the
early
weeks
of
february

the
most
of
all
the
historians
of
the
siege
turns
aside
for
a
moment
from
his
traverses
and
to
describe
the
murmurs
of
the
weary
infantry
of
the
corps
who
ever
heard
before
they
asked
of
an
army
of
men
being
set
to
take
a
town
defended
by
madmen
we
have
conquered
a
quarter
of
it
and
now
we
are
completely
fought
out
we
must
halt
and
wait
for
reinforcements
or
we
shall
all
perish
and
be
buried
in
these
cursed
ruins
before
we
can
rout
out
the
last
of
these
fanatics
from
their
last
stronghold
lannes
did
his
best
to
encourage
the
rank
and
file
by
showing
them
that
the
spaniards
were
suffering
far
more
than
they
and
by
pointing
out
that
the
moment
must
inevitably
come
when
the
defence
must
break
down
from
mere
exhaustion
he
also
endeavoured
to
obtain
reinforcements
from
the
emperor
but
only
received
assurances
that
some
conscripts
and
convalescents
for
the
corps
should
be
sent
to
him
from
pampeluna
and
bayonne
no
fresh
regiments
could
be
spared
from
france
when
the
affairs
of
central
europe
were
looking
so
doubtful
the
best
plan
which
the
marshal
could
devise
for
breaking
down
the
resolution
of
the
spaniards
was
to
lengthen
his
front
of
attack
and
so
endeavour
to
distract
the
attention
of
the
besieged
from
the
main
front
of
advance
towards
the
coso
belmas
ii
cf
rogniat
and
legendre
berthier
to
lannes
paris
this
was
only
to
be
done
by
causing
the
division
of
gazan
which
had
so
long
remained
passive
in
front
of
the
suburb
to
open
an
energetic
attack
on
that
outlying
part
of
the
fortress
the
advantage
to
be
secured
in
this
direction
was
not
merely
that
a
certain
amount
of
the
defenders
would
be
drawn
away
from
the
city
if
the
suburb
were
captured
it
would
be
possible
to
erect
batteries
in
it
which
would
search
the
whole
northern
side
of
saragossa
the
one
quarter
of
the
city
which
was
still
comparatively
unaffected
by
the
bombardment
here
the
bulk
of
the
civil
population
was
crowded
together
and
here
too
palafox
had
collected
the
greater
part
of
his
stores
and
magazines
if
the
last
safe
corner
of
the
city
were
exposed
to
a
bombardment
from
a
fresh
quarter
it
would
probably
do
much
to
lower
the
hopes
of
the
defenders
during
the
last
days
of
january
gazan
s
division
had
pressed
back
the
spanish
outposts
in
front
of
the
suburb
and
on
the
thirtieth
of
that
month
lannes
had
sent
over
two
companies
of
siege
artillery
to
construct
batteries
opposite
the
convents
of
jesus
and
san
lazaro
it
was
not
till
february
however
that
he
ordered
a
serious
and
active
attack
to
be
pressed
in
this
quarter
from
the
trench
which
covered
the
front
of
gazan
s
investing
lines
a
second
parallel
was
thrown
out
and
two
breaching
batteries
erected
against
the
jesus
convent
on
the
fourth
an
advance
by
zigzags
was
pushed
still
further
forward
and
more
guns
brought
up
some
little
delay
was
caused
by
an
unexpected
swelling
of
the
ebro
which
inundated
that
part
of
the
trenches
which
lay
nearest
to
the
river
but
by
the
eighth
all
was
ready
for
the
assault
the
jesus
convent
as
a
glance
at
the
map
will
readily
show
was
the
most
projecting
point
of
the
defences
of
the
suburb
and
was
not
well
protected
by
any
flanking
fire
from
the
other
works
indeed
it
was
only
helped
to
any
appreciable
extent
by
a
long
fire
across
the
water
from
the
northern
side
of
saragossa
and
by
the
few
gunboats
which
were
moored
near
the
bridge
it
was
a
weak
structure
merely
a
brick
convent
with
a
ditch
beyond
it
and
the
breaching
batteries
had
found
no
difficulty
in
opening
many
large
gaps
in
its
masonry
on
the
eighth
it
was
stormed
by
taupin
s
brigade
of
gazan
s
division
the
garrison
made
a
creditable
resistance
which
cost
the
french
ninety
men
and
then
retired
to
san
lazaro
and
the
main
fortifications
of
the
suburb
the
french
established
themselves
in
the
convent
and
connected
it
with
their
finally
turning
its
ruins
into
part
of
the
third
parallel
which
they
began
to
draw
out
against
the
remaining
transpontine
works
they
would
probably
have
proceeded
to
complete
their
operations
in
this
direction
within
the
next
two
or
three
days
if
it
had
not
been
for
an
interruption
from
without
the
two
brothers
lazan
and
francisco
palafox
had
now
united
their
forces
and
had
come
forward
to
the
line
of
the
sierra
de
alcubierre
only
twenty
miles
from
saragossa
the
former
with
his
men
from
catalonia
the
latter
with
a
mass
of
peasants
mortier
from
his
post
at
perdiguera
reported
their
approach
to
lannes
and
the
latter
went
out
in
person
to
meet
them
taking
with
him
guérin
s
brigade
of
gazan
s
division
and
leaving
only
that
of
taupin
to
hold
the
lines
opposite
the
suburb
faced
by
the
veteran
bayonets
of
the
corps
the
two
palafoxes
felt
that
they
were
helpless
and
retreated
towards
fraga
and
lerida
without
attempting
to
fight
on
the
thirteenth
therefore
lannes
came
back
to
the
siege
with
the
troops
that
he
had
drawn
away
from
it
while
he
was
absent
palafox
had
a
splendid
opportunity
for
a
sortie
on
a
large
scale
against
taupin
and
his
isolated
brigade
for
only
men
were
facing
the
suburb
but
the
time
had
already
gone
by
in
which
the
garrison
was
capable
of
such
an
advance
they
could
not
now
dispose
of
more
than
men
soldiers
and
peasants
and
citizens
all
included
and
none
of
these
could
be
drawn
away
from
the
city
where
the
was
always
growing
weaker
indeed
its
numbers
were
so
thinned
by
the
epidemic
that
palafox
was
guarding
the
aljafferia
with
no
more
than
men
and
manning
the
unattacked
western
front
with
convalescents
from
the
hospitals
who
could
hardly
stand
and
often
died
at
their
posts
during
the
cold
and
damp
hours
of
the
night
all
his
available
efficients
were
engaged
in
the
with
the
corps
for
while
the
attack
on
the
suburb
was
being
pressed
the
slow
advance
of
the
besiegers
within
the
walls
was
never
slackened
on
some
days
they
won
a
whole
block
of
houses
by
their
mining
operations
on
others
they
lost
many
men
and
gained
no
advantage
the
right
attack
was
extending
itself
towards
the
river
and
working
from
the
convent
of
san
augustin
into
the
quarter
of
the
tanneries
at
the
same
time
it
was
also
moving
on
toward
the
coso
but
with
extreme
slowness
for
the
spaniards
made
a
specially
desperate
defence
in
the
houses
about
the
university
and
the
church
of
the
trinity
one
building
which
covered
the
traverse
across
the
coso
to
the
south
of
the
university
stood
separate
assaults
and
four
explosions
and
held
out
from
the
ninth
to
the
eighteenth
effectually
keeping
back
the
advance
of
the
besiegers
in
this
direction
nor
could
the
french
ever
succeed
in
connecting
their
field
of
operations
on
this
front
with
that
which
centred
around
santa
engracia
down
to
the
very
end
of
the
siege
the
saragossans
clung
desperately
to
the
corner
of
the
city
and
kept
control
of
it
right
down
to
the
external
walls
and
the
bank
of
the
huerba
where
they
still
possessed
a
narrow
strip
of
yards
of
the
belmas
ii
and
before
the
left
attack
of
the
french
that
from
the
santa
engracia
side
made
much
more
progress
though
even
here
it
was
slow
and
dearly
bought
on
february
however
in
spite
of
several
checks
the
besiegers
for
the
first
time
forced
their
way
as
far
as
the
coso
working
through
the
ruined
hospital
which
had
been
destroyed
in
the
first
siege
on
the
same
day
at
the
angle
of
their
advance
they
made
a
valuable
conquest
in
the
church
and
convent
of
san
francisco
a
mine
was
driven
under
this
great
building
from
the
ruins
of
the
hospital
and
filled
with
no
less
than
pounds
of
powder
it
had
not
been
discovered
by
the
spaniards
and
the
convent
was
full
of
at
the
moment
of
the
explosion
the
whole
grenadier
company
of
the
regiment
of
valencia
and
irregulars
were
blown
up
and
perished
to
a
man
nor
was
this
all
in
the
northern
part
of
the
building
was
established
the
main
factory
for
military
equipment
of
the
army
of
aragon
it
was
crammed
with
workpeople
largely
women
for
palafox

forgotten
or
refused
to
withdraw
the
dépôt
to
a
less
convenient
and
spacious
but
more
safe
position
all
these
unfortunate
to
the
number
of
at
least
perished
and

for
hundreds
of
yards
around
were
strewn
with
their
dismembered
limbs
in
lejeune
i
the
reader
will
find
some
horrible
anecdotes
of
this
explosion
it
might
have
been
expected
that
as
the
immediate
consequence
of
this
awful
catastrophe
the
french
would
have
made
a
long
step
forward
in
this
direction
but
such
was
not
the
case
before
the
smoke
had
cleared
away
spaniards
rushed
forward
from
the
inner
defences
and
occupied
part
of
the
ruins
of
san
francisco
a
body
of
peasants
headed
by
the
colonel
de
fleury
got
into
the
of
the
convent
which
had
not
fallen
with
the
rest
and
kept
up
from
its
leads
a
vigorous
plunging
fire
upon
the
besiegers
when
they
stole
forward
to
burrow
into
the
mass
of
débris
but
with
the
loss
of
some
thirty
men
the
french
succeeded
in
mastering
of
the
ruins
next
day
they
cleared
the
rest
and
stormed
the
belfry
where
de
fleury
and
his
men
were
all
bayonetted
after
a
desperate
fight
on
the
winding
stairs
it
was
first
from
the
commanding
height
of
this
steeple
that
the
french
officers
obtained
a
full
view
of
the
city
the
sight
was
encouraging
to
them
they
could
realize
how
much
the
inner
parts
of
the
place
had
suffered
from
the
bombardment
and
noted
with
their
telescopes
the
small
number
of
defenders
visible
behind
the
further
barricades
the
heaps
of
corpses
in
the
streets
and
the
slow
and
dejected
pace
of
the
few
passengers
visible
two
great
gallows
with
corpses
hanging
from
them
especially
attracted
the
eyes
of
the
onlookers
other
circumstances
united
on
this
and
the
following
day
february
to
show
that
the
defence
was
at
last
beginning
to
slacken
a
great
mob
of
peasants
mainly
women
came
out
of
the
portillo
gate
towards
morlot
s
trenches
and
prayed
hard
for
permission
to
go
through
the
lines
to
their
villages
they
were
not
fired
on
but
given
a
loaf
apiece
and
then
driven
back
into
the
city
it
was
still
more
significant
that
at
night
on
the
eleventh
four
or
five
bodies
of
deserters
stole
out
to
the
french
they
were
all
foreigners
belonging
to
the
swiss
battalion
which
was
shut
up
in
saragossa
several
officers
were
among
them
to
excuse
themselves
they
said
that
palafox
and
the
friars
were
mad
and
that
they
judged
that
all
further
defence
had
become
impossible
yet
the
siege
was
to
endure
for
nine
days
longer
lejeune
i
the
suizos

of
which
the
unfortunate
fleury
had
been
colonel
had
not
all
perished
on
arteche

and
lejeune
i
though
the
two
main
attacks
continued
to
press
slowly
forward
and
that
on
the
left
had
now
reached
the
coso
and
covered
a
front
of
yards
on
the
southern
side
of
that
great
street
it
was
not
on
this
front
that
the
decisive
blow
was
destined
to
be
given
on
the
eighteenth
lannes
determined
to
deliver
the
great
assault
on
the
suburb
where
the
batteries
in
the
third
parallel
and
about
the
jesus
convent
had
now
completely
shattered
the
san
lazaro
defences
all
gazan
s
men
being
now
back
in
their
trenches
since
mortier
s
expedition
had
driven
off
the
marquis
of
lazan
lannes
considered
that
he
might
safely
risk
the
storm
played
on
san
lazaro
throughout
the
morning
of
the
eighteenth
and
no
less
than
eight
practicable
breaches
were
opened
in
it
and
the
works
to
its
right
and
left
at
noon
three
storming
columns
leaped
out
of
the
trenches
and
raced
for
the
nearest
of
these
entries
all
three
burst
through
there
was
a
sharp
struggle
in
the
street
of
the
suburb
and
then
the
french
reached
and
seized
a
block
of
houses
at
the
head
of
the
bridge
which
cut
the
defence
in
two
and
rendered
a
retreat
into
saragossa
almost
impossible
the
spaniards
seeing
that
all
was
lost
split
into
two
bodies
one
tried
to
force
its
way
across
the
bridge
but
only
passed
the
rest
were
slain
or
captured
the
main
part
consisting
of
the
defenders
of
the
western
front
of
the
suburb
formed
in
a
solid
mass
and
abandoning
their
defences
tried
to
escape
westward
up
the
bank
of
the
ebro
into
the
open
country
they
got
across
the
inundation
in
their
front
but
when
they
had
gone
thus
far
were
surrounded
by
two
regiments
of
french
cavalry
and
forced
to
surrender
they
numbered
men
under
general
manso
commanding
the
division
of
palafox
s
army
the
one
which
furnished
the
garrison
of
the
suburb

the
whole

been
killed
by

illustration
second
siege
of
saragossa
to
this
was
not
the
only
disaster
suffered
by
the
saragossans
on
the
eighteenth
at
three
in
the
afternoon
when
the
news
of
the
loss
of
the
suburb
had
had
time
to
spread
round
the
town
and
the
attention
of
the
besieged
was
distracted
to
this
side
grandjean
s
division
attacked
the
houses
and
barricades
in
the
part
of
the
city
which
had
so
long
held
them
at
bay
a
great
mine
opened
a
breach
in
the
university
which
was
stormed
and
with
it
fell
the
houses
on
each
side
as
far
as
the
coso
at
the
same
time
another
attack
won
some
ground
in
the
direction
of
the
trinity
convent
and
the
ebro
next
day
the
spaniards
in
this
remote
corner
of
the
town
almost
cut
off
from
the
main
body
of
the
defenders
and
now
battered
from
the
rear
by
new
works
thrown
up
in
the
suburb
in
and
about
san
lazaro
drew
back
and
abandoned
the
quarter
of
the
tanneries
the
quays
and
the
outer
looking
over
the
mouth
of
the
huerba
on
the
nineteenth
it
was
evident
that
the
end
had
come
a
third
of
the
force
of
effective
men
of
which
palafox
could
dispose
had
been
killed
or
captured
at
the
storm
of
san
lazaro
the
city
was
now
being
fired
on
from
the
north
the
only
side
which
had
hitherto
been
safe
the
epidemic
was
worse
than
ever
a
day
are
said
to
have
died
during
the
final
week
of
the
siege
the
last
mills
which
the
garrison
possessed
had
lately
been
destroyed
and
no
more
flour
was
issued
but
unground
corn
which
had
to
be
smashed
up
between
or
boiled
and
eaten
as
a
sort
of
porridge
the
supply
of
powder
was
beginning
to
run
low
not
from
want
of
material
to
compound
it
but
from
the
laboratories
having
been
mostly
destroyed
and
from
the
greater
part
of
the
arsenal
workmen
having
died
only
about
pounds
a
day
six
quintals
could
now
be
turned
out
and
the
daily
expenditure
in
the
mines
and
barricades
came
to
much
more
on
this
morning
the
french
noted
that
at
many
points
the
defence
seemed
to
be
slackening
and
that
parts
of
the
line
were
very
feebly
manned
they
made
more
progress
this
day
than
in
any
earlier
hours
of
the
siege
their
main
work
however
was
to
run
six
large
mines
under
the
coso
till
they
got
below
the
houses
on
its
further
side
somewhat
to
the
right
of
san
francisco
rogniat
placed
pounds
of
powder
in
each
a
quantity
that
was
calculated
to
blow
up
the
whole
quarter
it
was
not
necessary
to
use
them
the
spirits
of
the
defenders
had
at
last
been
broken
and
surrender
was
openly
spoken
of
though
its
mention
ten
days
earlier
would
have
cost
the
life
of
the
proposer
palafox
on
his
sick
bed
understood
that
all
was
over
he
sent
for
general
march
and
resigned
the
military
command
to
him
but
in
order
that
he
might
not
seem
to
be
shirking
his
responsibility
and
trying
to
put
the
ignominy
of
asking
for
terms
on
his
successor
he
sent
his
casseillas
to
lannes
offering
surrender
but
demanding
that
the
troops
should
march
out
with
the
honours
of
war
and
join
the
nearest
spanish
army
in
the
field
then
he
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
and
prepared
to
die
for
the
fever
lay
heavy
upon
him
and
broken
with
despair
and
fatigue
he
thought
that
he
had
not
many
hours
to
live
march
s
appointment
not
being
well
taken
the
loss
of
the
monte
torrero
was
still
remembered
against
him
palafox
s
last
act
was
to
give
over
charge
of
the
city
to
a
junta
of
persons
mainly
local
notables
and
clergy
to
whom
the
finishing
of
the
negotiations
would
fall
their
names
can
be
found
on
of
arteche
vol
iv
of
course
lannes
sent
back
the
s
with
the
message
that
he
must
ask
for
unconditional
surrender
and
that
the
proposal
that
the
garrison
should
be
allowed
to
depart
was
absurd
the
fighting
was
resumed
on
the
morning
of
the
twentieth
and
the
french
were
making
appreciable
progress
when
the
junta
once
more
sent
to
ask
terms
from
the
besiegers
it
was
not
without
some
bitter
debate
among
themselves
that
they
took
this
step
for
there
was
still
a
minority
including
march
and
the
priest
padre
consolation
who
wished
to
continue
the
resistance
they
were
backed
by
a
section
of
the
citizens
who
began
to
collect
and
to
raise
angry
cries
of
treason
but
the
whole
of
the
soldiery
and
the
major
part
of
the
civilian
defenders
were
prepared
to
yield
at
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
they
sent
out
to
ask
for
a
hours
truce
to
settle
terms
of
surrender
lannes
granted
them
two
hours
to
send
him
out
a
deputation
charged
with
full
powers
to
capitulate
and
ordered
the
bombardment
and
the
mining
to
cease
his
who
bore
the
message
was
nearly
murdered
by
fanatics
in
the
street
and
was
rescued
with
difficulty
by
some
officers
of
the
regular
army
but
the
junta
sent
him
back
with
the
message
that
the
deputation
should
be
forthcoming
and
within
the
stipulated
time
eleven
of
its
members
came
out
from
the
portillo
gate
to
the
marshal
s
head
quarters
on
the
calatayud
road
there
was
not
much
discussion
lannes
contented
himself
with
pointing
out
to
the
spaniards
that
the
place
was
at
his
mercy
he
had
the
plan
of
his
unrolled
before
them
and
pointed
out
the
position
of
the
six
great
mines
under
the
coso
as
well
as
those
of
the
advanced
posts
which
he
had
gained
during
the
last
two
days
the
deputies
made
some
feeble
attempts
to
secure
that
the
name
of
ferdinand
vii
should
appear
in
the
articles
of
capitulation
and
that
the
clergy
should
be
guaranteed
immunity
and
undisturbed
possession
of
their
benefices
lannes
waved
all
such
proposals
aside
and
dictated
a
form
of
surrender
which
was
on
the
whole
reasonable
and
even
generous
the
garrison
should
march
out
on
the
following
day
and
lay
down
its
arms
yards
outside
the
portillo
gate
those
who
would
swear
homage
to
king
joseph
should
have
their
liberty
and
might
take
service
with
him
if
they
wished
those
who
refused
the
oath
should
march
as
prisoners
to
france
the
city
should
be
granted
a
general
pardon
the
churches
should
be
respected
private
property
should
not
be
meddled
with
the
citizens
must
surrender
all
their
weapons
of
whatever
sort
any
civil
magistrates
or
employés
who
wished
to
keep
their
places
must
take
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
king
joseph
in
lejeune
i
will
be
found
a
most
picturesque
account
of
the
interview
of
the
french
envoy
with
the
and
despairing
junta
almost
hysterical
with
rage
and
shame
but
accepting
the
inevitable
it
is
notable
that
there
was
not
a
single
churchman
among
them
though
there
were
eight
among
the
members
of
the
junta
the
clergy
represented
to
the
last
the
fighting
section
lejeune
in
his
interesting
narrative
of
this
interview
says
that
he
saw
one
of
the
deputies
pore
over
the
map
and
recognize
his
own
house
among
the
mined
buildings
he
crossed
himself
five
or
six
times
and
cried
in
accents
of
bitter
grief
la
casa
the
name
of
don
joachim
ciscala
does
occur
among
the
eleven
signatures
so
the
story
is
probably
true
lejeune
i
on
the
following
morning
the
garrison
marched
out
of
peasants
and
soldiers
there
were
altogether
about
men
of
whom
were
convalescents
from
the
hospitals
never
had
any
of
us
gazed
on
a
more
sad
or
touching
sight
writes
lejeune
these
sickly
looking
men
bearing
in
their
bodies
the
seeds
of
the
fever
all
frightfully
emaciated
with
long
black
matted
beards
and
scarcely
able
to
hold
their
weapons
dragged
themselves
slowly
along
to
the
sound
of
the
drum
their
clothes
were
torn
and
dirty
everything
about
them
bore
witness
to
terrible
misery
but
in
spite
of
their
livid
faces
blackened
with
powder
and
scarred
with
rage
and
grief
they
bore
themselves
with
dignity
and
pride
the
bright
coloured
sashes
the
large
round
hats
surmounted
by
a
few
cock
which
shaded
their
foreheads
the
brown
cloaks
or
flung
over
their
varied
costumes
lent
a
certain
picturesqueness
to
their
tattered
garb
when
the
moment
came
for
them
to
pile
their
arms
and
deliver
up
their
flags
many
of
them
gave
violent
expression
to
their
despair
their
eyes
gleamed
with
rage
and
their
savage
looks
seemed
to
say
that
they
had
counted
our
ranks
and
deeply
regretted
having
surrendered
to
such
a
small
army
of
enemies
lejeune
i
another
and
more
adds
they
were
a
most
motley
crowd
of
men
of
all
ages
and
conditions
some
in
uniform
more
without
it
the
officers
were
mostly
mounted
on
mules
or
donkeys
and
were
only
distinguished
from
the
men
by
their
hats
and
their
large
cloaks
many
were
smoking
their
and
talking
to
each
other
with
an
aspect
of
complete
indifference
but
all
were
not
so
resigned
the
whole
garrison
to
strong
defiled
in
front
of
us
the
majority
looked
so
utterly
unlike
soldiers
that
our
men
said
openly
to
each
other
that
they
ought
not
to
have
taken
so
long
or
spent
so
much
trouble
in
getting
rid
of
such
a
rabble
the
column
was
promptly
put
in
motion
for
france
under
the
escort
of
two
of
morlot
s
regiments
many
died
on
the
way
from
the
fever
whose
seeds
they
carried
with
them
few
or
none
as
might
have
been
supposed
took
advantage
of
the
offer
to
save
themselves
from
captivity
by
taking
the
oath
to
king
joseph
von
brandt
meinem
pp
it
is
sad
to
have
to
confess
that
the
french
did
not
keep
to
the
terms
of
the
capitulation
that
lannes
could
not
restrain
his
men
from
plunder
as
he
had
promised
was
hardly
surprising
there
were
so
many
empty
houses
and
churches
containing
valuables
that
it
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
victors
should
help
themselves
to
all
they
could
find
but
they
also
plundered
occupied
houses
and
even
stole
the
purses
of
the
captive
officers
what
was
worse
was
that
many
assassinations
took
place
especially
of
clergy
for
the
french
looked
upon
the
priests
and
friars
as
being
mainly
responsible
for
the
desperate
defence
two
in
especial
padre
basilio
bogiero
the
chaplain
of
palafox
and
santiago
sass
a
parish
priest
were
shot
in
cold
blood
two
days
after
the
surrender
public
opinion
in
the
french
ranks
was
convinced
that
they
more
than
any
one
else
had
kept
the
up
to
the
mark
palafox
himself
was
treated
with
great
brutality
as
he
lay
apparently
moribund
the
french
officer
who
had
been
made
interim
governor
of
saragossa
came
to
his
bedside
and
bade
him
to
sign
orders
for
the
surrender
of
jaca
and
monzon
when
he
refused
this
colonel
threatened
to
have
him
shot
but
left
him
alone
when
threats
had
no
effect
ere
he
was
convalescent
he
was
sent
off
to
france
where
the
emperor
ordered
that
he
should
be
treated
not
as
a
prisoner
of
war
but
as
guilty
of
treason
and
shut
him
up
for
many
years
as
a
close
captive

the
donjon
of
vincennes
for

see
arteche
iv
the
state
in
which
saragossa
was
found
by
the
french
hardly
bears
description
it
was
a
focus
of
corruption
one
mass
of
putrefying
corpses
according
to
a
report
which
lannes
elicited
from
the
municipal
officers
nearly
persons
had
died
in
the
place
since
the
siege
began
of
these
about
were
regular
or
irregular
the
rest
were
only
had
fallen
by
fire
and
sword
the
remainder
were
victims
of
the
far
more
deadly
pestilence
a
few
days
after
the
siege
was
ended
lannes
stated
that
the
total
population
of
the
town
was
now
only
souls
instead
of
the
which
it
had
contained
when
the
siege
began
but
his
estimate
does
not
include
some
thousands
of
citizens
who
had
fled
into
the
open
country
the
moment
that
they
were
released
from
investment
in
order
to
escape
from
the
contagion
in
the
city
il
est
impossible
que
saragosse

relève
wrote
the
marshal
cette
ville

it
was
weeks
indeed
before
the
dead
were
all
buried
months
before
the
contagion
of
the
died
out
from
the
miserable
city
even
after
five
years
of
the
capable
and
benevolent
government
of
suchet
it
was
still
half
desolate
and
no
attempt
had
been
made
to
rebuild
the
third
of
its
houses
and
churches
which
had
been
reduced
to
ashes
by
the
mines
and
the
bombardment
lannes
to
berthier
march
the
french
losses
in
front
of
saragossa
are
not
easy
to
calculate
belmas
says
that
the
total
of
casualties
was
about
in
the
infantry
but
he
takes
no
notice
of
the
losses
by
except
to
say
that
many
died
from
it
he
does
not
give
the
losses
of
the
artillery
except
of
that
small
part
of
it
which
was
not
attached
either
to
the
or
to
the
corps
considering
that
the
corps
alone
had
sick
on
january
and
that
typhus
is
a
notoriously
deadly
disease
it
is
probable
that
the
total
losses
of
the
french
during
the
siege
amounted
to
men
it
is
hard
otherwise
to
explain
the
difference
between
the
men
that
the
corps
counted
in
october
and
the
men
which
it
mustered
when
suchet
took
over
its
command
in
april
the
sufferings
of
the
corps
were
small
in
comparison
for
till
february
began
it
took
no
very
serious
part
in
the
siege
and
its
health
was
notoriously
far
better
than
that
of
junot
s
divisions
but
we
can
not
be
far
wrong
in
concluding
with
schepeler
and
arteche
that
the
total
french
loss
must
have
been
men
rather
than
the
given
by
napier
who
is
apparently
relying
on
rogniat
that
officer
gives
only
the
casualties
in
battle
and
not
the
losses
in
hospital
it
seems
quite
clear
that
the
men
in
hospital
which
belmas
mentions
on
ii
is
a
misprint
for
for
his
own
figures
show
that
there
were
invalids
six
weeks
earlier
and
before
the
deadly
had
begun
how
many
died
we
can
not
say
but
suchet
in
april
had
only
men
present
in
nineteen
battalions
i
with
eight
more
battalions
on
command
which
would
give
another
von
brandt
carefully
says
that
the
total
of
dead
does
not
include
the
thousands
who
perished
in
so
ended
the
siege
of
saragossa
a
magnificent
display
of
civic
courage
little
helped
by
strategy
or
tactics
for
palafox
though
a
splendid
leader
of
insurgents
was
as
his
conduct
in
october
and
november
had
shown
a
very
poor
general
he
made
a
gross
initial
mistake
in
shutting
up
in
a
place
which
could
have
been
easily
defended
by
if
he
had
sent
one
or
two
divisions
to
form
the
nucleus
of
an
army
of
relief
in
lower
aragon
with
orders
to
harass
but
not
to
fight
pitched
battles
it
is
hard
to
see
how
the
siege
could
have
been
kept
up
his
second
fault
was
the
refusal
to
make
sorties
on
a
large
scale
during
the
first
half
of
the
siege
while
he
was
still
in
possession
of
great
masses
of
superfluous
he
sent
out
scores
of
petty
sallies
of
a
few
hundred
men
but
never
moved
so
many
as
on
a
single
day
such
a
policy
worried
but
could
not
seriously
harm
the
french
while
it
destroyed
the
willing
men
of
the
garrison
if
the
had
saved
up
all
the
volunteers
whom
he
lost
by
tens
and
twenties
in
small
and
fruitless
attacks
on
the
trenches
he
could
have
built
up
with
them
a
that
would
have
pierced
through
the
french
line
at
any
point
that
he
chose
anything
might
have
been
done
during
the
three
weeks
while
mortier
was
at
calatayud
and
especially
during
the
days
when
gazan
with
his
men
was
cut
off
by
the
floods
and
isolated
on
the
further
bank
of
the
ebro
the
s
conduct
in
short
was
not
that
of
a
capable
officer
but
it
is
absurd
to
endeavour
to
represent
him
as
a
coward
or
as
a
puppet
whose
strings
were
pulled
by
fanatical
friars
he
knew
perfectly
well
what
he
was
doing
and
how
to
manage
the
disorderly
but
enthusiastic
masses
of
the
population
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
his
personal
influence
was
and
the
effect
of
his
constant
harangues
and
proclamations
immense
it
would
be
quite
as
true
to
say
that
the
friars
and
the
were
his
tools
as
that
he
was
theirs
he
had
to
humour
them
but
by
humouring
them
he
got
out
of
them
the
utmost
possible
service
against
the
stories
that
his
proclamations
were
written
for
him
and
that
he
had
to
be
goaded
into
issuing
every
order
that
came
from
his
head
quarters
we
have
the
evidence
of
vaughan
and
others
who
knew
him
well
it
is
unanimous
in
ascribing
to
him
incessant
activity
and
an
exuberant
fluency
in
composition
arteche
has
preserved
some
minutes
on
the
siege
which
he
wrote
long
after
the
peninsular
war
was
over
they
are
interesting
and
but
more
creditable
to
him
as
a
patriot
than
as
a
military
man
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
garrison
might
have
been
much
more
wisely
handled
but
it
is
doubtful
whether
under
any
other
direction
it
would
have
shown
so
much
energy
and
staying
power
there
is
certainly
no
other
spanish
siege
save
that
of
gerona
where
half
so
much
resolution
was
shown
if
the
defence
had
been
conducted
by
regular
officers
and
troops
alone
the
place
would
probably
have
fallen
three
weeks
earlier
if
the
monks
and
local
demagogues
had
been
in
command
and
patriotic
anarchy
alone
had
been
opposed
to
the
french
saragossa
would
possibly
have
fallen
at
an
even
earlier
date
from
mere
want
of
intelligent
direction
palafox
with
all
his
faults
supplied
the
connecting
link
between
the
two
sections
of
the
defenders
and
kept
the
soldiery
to
work
by
means
of
the
example
of
the
citizens
while
he
restrained
the
citizens
by
dint
of
his
immense
personal
influence
over
them
won
in
the
first
siege
in
short
he
may
have
been
vain
bombastic
and
a
bad
tactician
but
he
was
a
good
spaniard
if
there
had
been
a
few
dozen
men
more
of
his
stamp
in
spain
the
task
of
the
french
in
would
have
been
infinitely
more
difficult
the
example
of
saragossa
was
invaluable
to
the
nation
and
to
europe
the
knowledge
of
it
did
much
to
sicken
the
french
soldiery
of
the
whole
war
and
to
make
every
officer
and
man
who
entered
spain
march
not
with
the
light
heart
that
he
felt
in
germany
or
italy
but
with
gloom
and
disgust
and
want
of
confidence
they
never
failed
to
do
their
duty
but
they
fought
without
the
enthusiasm
which
helped
them
so
much
in
all
the
earlier
wars
of
the
empire
the
foundation
for
most
of
the
stories
against
palafox
seems
to
be

the

by
the
middle
of
the
month
of
february
as
we
have
already
seen
andalusia
was
once
more
covered
by
two
considerable
spanish
armies
cartaojal
with
the
wrecks
of

and
the

levies
of

holding

had
rallied
behind

the
remains
of
the
army
of

he
was
at

engaged
in
reducing
it
to
order
by
the
only
method
of
which
he
was
master
the
shooting
of
any
soldier
who
showed
signs
of
disobedience
or
mutiny
the
army
deserved
nothing
better
its
dastardly
murder
of
its
unfortunate
general
in
december
justified
any
amount
of
severity
in
his
successor
there
are
details
in
the
diary
of
a
citizen
of
badajoz
in
the
meanwhile
victor
after
his
victory
at
ucles
and
his
vain
attempt
to
surprise
del
palacio
had
passed
away
to
the
west
leaving
nothing
in
the
plains
of
la
mancha
save
the
dragoons
of
milhaud
and
who
were
placed
as
a
cavalry
screen
across
the
roads
to
the
south
with
their
divisional
head
quarters
at
ocaña
and
madridejos
respectively
the
marshal
drew
back
to
the
valley
of
the
tagus
and
marched
by
toledo
on
almaraz
this
was
in
strict
execution
of
the
plan
dictated
by
napoleon
before
he
left
spain
it
will
be
remembered
that
he
had
directed
that
when
the
february
rains
were
over
victor
should
move
on
badajoz
to
assist
by
his
presence
in
that
direction
the
projected
attack
of
soult
on
lisbon
only
when
estremadura
and
portugal
had
been
subdued
was
the
attack
on
andalusia
to
be
carried
out
soult
as
we
shall
see
was
by
no
fault
of
his
own
much
slower
in
his
movements
than
napoleon
had
expected
and
victor
waited
in
vain
at
talavera
for
any
news
that
the
invasion
of
portugal
was
in
progress
hence
the
spaniards
gained
some
weeks
of
respite
the
ranks
of
their
armies
were
filled
up
and
the
spirits
of
their
generals
rose
cartaojal
remained
for
some
time
at
la
carolina
reorganizing
and
recruiting
the
depleted
and
battalions
which
infantado
had
handed
over
to
him
he
had
expected
to
be
attacked
by
victor
but
when
he
learnt
that
the
marshal
had
gone
off
to
toledo
and
that
la
mancha
was
covered
only
by
a
thin
line
of
cavalry
he
began
to
dream
of
resuming
the
offensive
such
a
policy
was
most
unwise
it
shows
that
cartaojal
like
so
many
other
spanish
generals
was
still
possessed
with
the
fatal
mania
for
grand
operations
and
pitched
battles
he
had
in
his
head
nothing
less
than
a
plan
for
thrusting
back
the
cavalry
screen
opposite
to
him
and
for
recovering
the
whole
of
la
mancha
if
victor
s
corps
had
been
the
only
force
available
to
oppose
him
there
would
have
been
something
to
say
for
the
plan
an
advance
on
toledo
and
madrid
must
have
brought
back
the
duke
of
belluno
from
his
advance
towards
estremadura
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
jourdan
and
king
joseph
had
not
left
the
roads
to
la
mancha
unguarded
they
had
drafted
down
from
madrid
two
infantry
divisions
of
the
corps
whose
command
sebastiani
had
now
taken
over
from
lefebvre
the
first
division
lay
at
toledo
the
third
valence
s
poles
at
aranjuez
thus
the
former
supported
the
latter
milhaud
ignorant
apparently
of
the
fact
that
there
was
anything
but
cavalry
in
his
front
cartaojal
resolved
to
beat
up
the
french
outposts
with
this
object
he
told
off
half
his
infantry
and
of
his
horse
under
the
duke
of
albuquerque
a
gallant
and
enterprising
but
somewhat
reckless
officer
of
whom
we
shall
hear
much
during
the
next
two
years
of
the
war
marching
with
speed
and
secrecy
albuquerque
with
horse
and
infantry
fell
upon
digeon
s
brigade
of
dragoons
at
mora
on
february
he
tried
to
cut
it
off
with
his
cavalry
while
he
attacked
it
in
front
with
his
foot
but
digeon
saw
the
danger
in
time
and
fell
back
in
haste
after
losing
a
few
men
of
the
dragoons
and
some
of
his
baggage
his
demand
for
assistance
promptly
brought
down
sebastiani
with
the
division
of
the
corps
and
the
two
remaining
brigades
of
s
cavalry
the
moment
that
he
heard
that
a
heavy
force
had
arrived
in
his
front
albuquerque
retired
as
far
as
consuegra
where
the
french
caught
up
his
rear
and
inflicted
some
loss
upon
it
he
then
fell
still
further
back
crossed
the
guadiana
and
took
post
at
manzanares
sebastiani
did
not
pursue
him
beyond
consuegra
giving
as
his
excuse
the
exhausted
condition
of
the
for
these
operations
compare
jourdan
s
pp
and
arteche
cartaojal
meanwhile
with
the
rest
of
his
army
had
come
up
from
the
passes
to
ciudad
real
following
in
wake
of
albuquerque
s
advance
when
he
met
with
his
lieutenant
they
fell
to
quarrelling
both
as
to
what
had
already
occurred
and
as
to
what
should
now
be
done
for
the
duke
was
anxious
to
induce
his
chief
to
make
a
general
advance
on
toledo
while
cartaojal
desired
him
to
take
a
single
division
of
infantry
and
to
try
the
adventure
himself
while
they
were
disputing
orders
came
from
the
supreme
junta
that
troops
were
to
be
detached
from
the
army
of
la
mancha
to
strengthen
that
of
estremadura
cartaojal
took
the
opportunity
of
getting
rid
of
albuquerque
by
putting
him
at
the
head
of
the
detachment
which
was
to
be
sent
to
cuesta
the
duke
not
loth
to
depart
went
off
with
a
division
of
infantry
and
a
regiment
of
cavalry
and
marched
down
the
guadiana
into
estremadura
the
cavalry
regiment
had
only
sabres
the
infantry
battalions
were
campomayor
tiradores
de
cadiz
granaderos
del
general
militia
of
cordova
guadix
and
osuna
only
the
was
an
old
regular
corps
cartaojal
remained
for
the
first
three
weeks
of
march
at
ciudad
real
and
manzanares
with
the
main
body
of
his
force
about
horse
and
foot
keeping
behind
him
at
the
foot
of
the
passes
a
reserve
of
men
under
la
peña
this
was
tempting
providence
for
he
was
now
aware
that
the
whole
corps
as
well
as
a
great
mass
of
cavalry
was
in
front
of
him
and
that
he
might
be
attacked
at
any
moment
his
position
too
was
a
faulty
one
he
had
descended
into
the
very
midst
of
the
broad
plain
of
la
mancha
and
had
occupied
as
his
head
quarters
an
open
town
easy
to
turn
on
either
flank
and
with
a
perfectly
fordable
river
as
its
sole
defence
as
if
this
peril
was
not
sufficient
cartaojal
suddenly
resolved
that
he
would
make
the
dash
at
toledo
which
albuquerque
had
proposed
to
him
though
he
had
refused
to
send
his
whole
army
against
that
point
when
the
scheme
was
pressed
upon
him
by
his
late
the
nearest
hostile
troops
to
him
were
a
regiment
of
polish
lancers
belonging
to
lasalle
s
division
which
lay
at
yébenes
twenty
miles
outside
toledo
making
a
swift
stroke
at
this
force
while
it
was
far
from
expecting
any
advance
on
his
part
cartaojal
drove
it
in
killing
or
taking
nearly
of
the
poles
march
but
sebastiani
came
up
to
their
aid
with
an
infantry
division
and
three
regiments
of
milhaud
s
dragoons
the
spaniard
refused
to
accept
battle
and
fell
hastily
back
to
ciudad
real
where
he
established
his
whole
army
behind
the
river
guadiana
in
and
about
the
open
town
he
was
most
unsafe
in
the
midst
of
the
vast
plain
and
was
soon
to
rue
his
want
of
caution
sebastiani
had
been
joined
by
his
polish
division
and
by
part
of
his
and
having
some
or
men
in
hand
had
resolved
to
pay
back
on
cartaojal
the
beating
up
of
his
outpost
at
yébenes
on
march
milhaud
s
division
of
dragoons
seized
the
bridge
of
peralvillo
close
to
ciudad
real
and
crossed
to
the
southern
bank
of
the
guadiana
the
spanish
general
called
up
all
his
cavalry
and
some
of
his
foot
and
marched
to
drive
the
dragoons
back
they
withdrew
across
the
water
but
still
held
the
bridge
behind
which
they
had
planted
their
artillery
next
morning
sebastiani
s
infantry
came
up
and
he
determined
to
attack
ciudad
real
cartaojal
who
was
taken
completely
off
his
guard
was
suddenly
informed
that
column
after
column
was
pressing
across
the
bridge
and
marching
against
him
he
did
not
dream
for
a
moment
of
fighting
but
gave
orders
for
an
instant
retreat
towards
the
passes
he
threw
out
his
cavalry
and
horse
artillery
to
cover
the
withdrawal
of
his
infantry
who
hurried
away
in
half
a
dozen
small
bodies
across
the
interminable
plain
sebastiani
charged
the
spanish
horse
with
his
polish
lancers
and
dutch
hussars
supported
by
milhaud
s
dragoons
the
covering
force
broke
and
fled
and
the
pursuers
came
up
with
several
of
the
columns
of
the
retreating
infantry
some
of
them
were
dispersed
others
were
surrounded
and
taken
prisoners
the
pursuit
was
continued
next
morning
till
it
was
interrupted
by
a
fearful
burst
of
rain
which
darkened
the
horizon
hid
the
fugitives
and
stopped
the
chase
or
cartaojal
s
army
might
have
been
entirely
destroyed
he
lost
in
this
rout
which
it
would
be
absurd
to
call
a
battle
five
guns
three
standards
and
more
than
prisoners
among
whom
were
officers
the
loss
in
killed
and
wounded
was
probably
not
very
great
for
there
had
been
no
attempt
at
a
stand

was
not

of

after
shooting
a

disgracing
some

distributed
his
troops

began
to
move
them

in

abandoning

thereupon

broke
the

a
difficult

failed
and
the
work
had
to
be
completed
with
the
pick
it
was
so
badly
managed
that
when

an

still
upon

were

two
passages
of
the
tagus
that
at
almaraz
and
that
by
the
puente

near

he
arranged
his

opposite

the
possible

on

was
a

uneasiness

orders
to
clear
the
nearer
hills
they
crossed
the
tagus
at
the
bridge
of
arzobispo
a
little
below
talavera
and
forced
back
the
division
of
trias
which
was
watching
this
flank
of
cuesta
s
position
but
the
country
was
almost
impassable
for
cavalry
a
mere
mass
of
ravines
and
spurs
of
the
sierra
de
guadalupe
and
after
advancing
as
far
as
the
pass
of
san
vincente
and
seeing
the
spaniards
begin
to
gather
in
force
on
his
front
and
flank
lasalle
retreated
and
recrossed
the
tagus
without
having
effected
anything
of
importance
it
was
not
till
a
month
later
that
the
french
took
the
offensive
in
earnest
victor
was
now
returned
from
his
excursion
into
la
mancha
with
his
two
divisions
of
the
corps
and
the
six
dragoon
regiments
of
whom
he
had
drawn
off
to
toledo
handing
over
the
charge
of
observing
cartaojal
to
milhaud
and
sebastiani
uniting
these
forces
to
those
of
leval
and
lasalle
he
massed
at
talavera
an
army
of
some
or
men
of
whom
were
admirable
cavalry
this
is
the
estimate
of
jourdan
and
exactly
agrees
with
the
figures
which
i
give
on
joseph
and
jourdan
were
now
of
the
opinion
that
it
was
time
for
victor
to
move
forward
on
estremadura
in
accordance
with
the
great
plan
for
the
conquest
of
southern
spain
which
the
emperor
had
left
behind
as
his
legacy
when
he
departed
from
valladolid
it
was
true
that
this
movement
was
to
have
been
carried
out
in
with
the
advance
of
marshal
soult
upon
portugal
but
no
news
could
be
got
of
the
duke
of
dalmatia
s
present
position
the
last
dispatch
from
him
was
nearly
a
month
old
writing
from
orense
on
february
he
had
stated
that
he
hoped
to
be
at
chaves
by
march
and
should
then
march
on
oporto
and
lisbon
according
to
napoleon
s
calculations
he
was
to
be
at
the
city
within
ten
days
of
the
capture
of
oporto
it
was
therefore
in
the
opinion
of
joseph
and
jourdan
high
time
that
victor
should
start
in
order
to
get
in
touch
with
soult
when
the
portuguese
capital
should
be
occupied
the
duke
of
belluno
however
raised
many
difficulties
even
when
he
had
been
shown
the
emperor
s
orders
he
complained
that
he
ought
to
have
the
help
of
lapisse
s
division
the
second
of
his
own
corps
which
still
lay
at
salamanca
he
doubted
whether
he
could
dare
to
take
on
with
him
for
an
expedition
into
estremadura
the
german
division
of
leval
he
ought
perhaps
to
leave
it
at
talavera
and
almaraz
in
order
to
keep
up
his
communications
with
madrid
if
this
were
done
he
would
muster
only
men
for
his
great
forward
movement
and
he
had
the
gravest
doubt
whether
soult
could
or
would
give
him
the
assistance
of
which
the
emperor
had
written
even
if
he
seized
lisbon
within
the
appointed
time
finally
he
was
short
of
engineer
officers
sappers
horses
and
reserve
ammunition
much
of
what
the
duke
of
belluno
wrote
was
true
in
particular
the
idea
of
with
soult
was
perfectly
chimerical
napoleon
had
worked
out
all
his
logistics
to
an
erroneous
result
from
want
of
a
real
conception
of
the
conditions
and
difficulties
of
war
in
the
peninsula
but
some
of
the
pleas
which
victor
urged
merely
serve
to
show
his
disinclination
to
accept
the
task
which
had
been
set
him
and
in
especial
he
underrated
the
numbers
of
his
troops
beyond
the
limit
of
fair
statement
he
had
with
him
nine
battalions
of
ruffin
s
division
twelve
of
villatte
s
eight
of
leval
s
of
cavalry
he
had
six
regiments
of
s
dragoons
three
of
lasalle
s
light
cavalry
two
regiments
of
his
own
and
the
westphalian
regiment
of
the
corps
which
was
attached
to
leval
s
germans
the
total
must
have
amounted
to
infantry
and
about
cavalry
he
had
also
sixty
guns
with
artillerymen
and
chasseurs
and
dragoons
the
fourth
regiment
the
polish
lancers
was

in

of
his
reluctance
victor
was
forced
to
yield
to
the
pressure
of

and
the
emperor
s
explicit
orders
on
march
he
began
to
make
his
preparations
to
cross
the
tagus
and
to
attack
cuesta
it
was
reported
to
him
that
the
roads
starting
from
the
two
bridges
which
were
in
his
power
those
of
talavera
and
arzobispo
were
neither
of
them
practicable
for
artillery
and
that
only
the
route
by
almaraz
was
suitable
for
the
guns
and
heavy
baggage
but
the
bridge
of
almaraz
was
broken
and
beyond
it
were
visible
entrenchments
thrown
up
by
the
spaniards
and
a
considerable
body
of
troops
the
division
of
general
henestrosa
the
duke
of
belluno
determined
to
clear
the
way
for
a
crossing
at
almaraz
by
sending
infantry
across
the
tagus
by
the
passages
higher
with
orders
to
sweep
the
southern
bank
till
they
came
opposite
to
the
broken
bridge
they
were
to
dislodge
the
force
behind
it
and
then
the
artillery
the
baggage
and
cavalry
were
to
cross
on
a
bridge
of
rafts
which
was
being
prepared
close
to
almaraz
in
order
to
be
ready
the
moment
that
it
should
be
wanted
on
march
therefore
leval
s
germans
crossed
the
tagus
by
the
bridge
of
talavera
with
some
of
lasalle
s
cavalry
while
on
the
next
morning
victor
himself
passed
at
arzobispo
with
the
divisions
of
villatte
and
ruffin
the
combined
column
pushed
westward
by
a
bad
road
on
the
hillside
overhanging
the
river
in
a
difficult
country
of
rocks
and
woods
seamed
with
countless
ravines
where
cavalry
could
barely
act
and
artillery
would
have
been
perfectly
useless
cuesta
on
hearing
of
this
movement
to
turn
his
flank
threw
back
his
right
wing
and
bade
it
make
a
stand
behind
the
ravine
of
the
little
river
ibor
which
falls
into
the
tagus
between
arzobispo
and
almaraz
his
force
in
this
direction
consisted
of
the
division
of
the
duke
del
parque
about
strong
with
six
guns
on
the
seventeenth
victor
s
columns
with
the
germans
of
leval
at
their
head
arrived
before
the
defiles
of
meza
de
ibor
and
found
themselves
confronted
by
the
duke
who
was
firmly
established
on
the
other
side
of
the
ravine
in
a
fine
position
with
his
guns
on
a
projecting
rock
which
enfiladed
the
victor
directed
leval
s
eight
battalions
to
cross
the
ravine
and
storm
the
heights
on
the
other
side
this
they
did
in
very
gallant
style
but
not
without
heavy
losses
for
the
estremadurans
confident
in
the
strength
of
their
rugged
made
a
long
and
vigorous
resistance
till
the
germans
actually
came
to
close
quarters
with
them
and
ran
in
with
the
bayonet
del
parque
s
line
then
crumpled
up
and
dispersed
over
the
hillsides
finding
it
impossible
to
bring
off
his
guns
he
cast
them
over
the
precipice
into
the
ravine
below
the
germans
lost
seventy
killed
and
wounded
while
climbing
the
difficult
slopes
del
parque
s
men
probably
suffered
far
less
as
they
absconded
when
the
enemy
closed
and
had
been
under
cover
till
that
moment
the
supposition
of
some
french
authorities
that
the
defenders
of
meza
de
ibor
lost
men
is
most
improbable
the
country
was
one
exactly
suited
for
a
cheap
defence
and
for
an
easy
scattering
over
the
hills
in
the
moment
of
defeat
one
hessian
battalion
was
still
absent
in
garrison
at
segovia
so
the
total
of
the
division
was
not
much
over
the
duke
fell
back
on
deleytosa
higher
up
the
side
of
the
sierra
de
guadalupe
where
cuesta
had
established
his
head
quarters
here
he
was
joined
by
another
of
the
estremaduran
divisions
that
of
general
trias
nearly
strong
henestrosa
with
the
rest
of
the
army
was
still
watching
the
passage
at
almaraz
where
cuesta
had
made
up
his
mind
that
the
main
attack
of
the
french
would
be
delivered
he
persisted
for
some
time
in
believing
that
victor
s
movement
across
the
talavera
and
arzobispo
bridges
was
merely
a
feint
and
thus
it
was
that
del
parque
had
been
left
alone
to
bear
the
first
brunt
of
the
attack
when
he
was
at
last
convinced
that
the
bulk
of
victor
s
infantry
was
on
his
flank
and
that
almaraz
was
hopelessly
turned
the
old
hastily
sent
orders
to
henestrosa
to
abandon
his
entrenchments
opposite
the
bridge
and
to
retreat
on
truxillo
across
the
mountains
he
himself
took
that
path
without
delay
and
got
off
in
safety
with
his
two
leading
divisions
but
henestrosa
had
to
brush
across
the
front
of
the
advancing
french
and
was
in
some
danger
luckily
for
him
victor
was
more
set
on
clearing
the
road
from
almaraz
than
on
pursuing
the
enemy
when
henestrosa
had
disappeared
the
passage
was
open
and
the
cavalry
of
and
beaumont
guarding
the
artillery
and
of
the
corps
crossed
on
the
rafts
which
had
been
prepared
long
before
and
joined
the
infantry
and
the
marshal
the
passage
presented
more
difficulties
than
had
been
expected
for
it
proved
impossible
to
construct
a
permanent
bridge
the
stream
was
very
fierce
and
the
anchors
by
which
the
floats
were
moored
found
no
hold
in
the
smooth
rocky
bottom
the
guns
passed
either
by
being
sent
over
on
rafts
or
by
means
of
a
rope
ferry
which
was
with
some
difficulty
rigged
up
it
was
not
till
some
time
later
that
a
solid
bridge
of
boats
was
built
at
this
most
important
passage
one
cavalry
regiment
was
left
behind
to
protect
it
jourdan
s
apparently
the
westphalian
which
had
hitherto
been
attached
to
leval
s
german
division
cuesta
when
he
had
united
his
three
divisions
would
have
dearly
loved
to
give
battle
to
victor
behind
truxillo
in
the
excellent
position
of
the
puerto
de
santa
cruz
where
the
from
madrid
to
badajoz
crosses
the
sierra
de
guadalupe
his
love
for
general
engagements
was
by
no
means
cured
by
the
event
of
his
experiments
at
cabezon
and
medina
de
rio
seco
but
he
was
withheld
from
offering
battle
not
by
mere
prudence
but
by
the
fact
that
he
was
expecting
to
receive
two
considerable
reinforcements
the
marquis
de
portago
was
bringing
up
a
detachment
from
badajoz
three
battalions
which
had
been
intended
to
form
the
nucleus
of
a
new
fourth
division
that
was
being
organized
in
that
fortress
at
the
same
moment
albuquerque
was
expected
from
the
east
at
the
head
of
the
men
whom
the
supreme
junta
had
detached
from
the
army
of
la
mancha
and
had
sent
down
the
guadiana
to
join
that
of
estremadura
cuesta
wished
to
pick
up
these
men
before
he
gave
battle
four
more
had
to
be
left
behind
in
the
fortress
accordingly
he
evacuated
the
pass
of
santa
cruz
and
fell
back
southward
towards
his
reinforcements
leaving
henestrosa
with
the
bulk
of
his
cavalry
to
act
as
a
rearguard
that
officer
carried
out
his
duty
with
a
dash
and
a
vigour
that
were
rare
in
spanish
armies
at
this
date
when
the
fiery
lasalle
came
pressing
up
against
him
with
his
usual
fury
the
spanish
general
contrived
to
inflict
on

he
made
a
sudden
halt
and
drove
in
the
leading
squadron
of
the
french
by
a
charge
of
his
royal
carbineers
a
small
remnant
of
the
which
had
been
serving
with
the
army
of

its

the
french
lost
ten
killed
and
fifteen
wounded
jourdan
this
was
a
trifle
but
on
the
next
day
henestrosa
scored
a
far
more
tangible
advantage
noting
that
lasalle
s
leading
regiment
the
chasseurs
had
got
far
ahead
of
the
rest
of
the
division
and
was
pushing
on
with
reckless
haste
he
laid
a
trap
for
it
in
front
of
the
village
of
miajadas
presenting
a
small
body
of
cavalry
on
the
he
hid
on
each
side
of
it
a
strong
regiment
of
his
own
horse
with
orders
to
fall
upon
the
flank
and
rear
of
the
french
when
they
should
have
passed

ambush
the
two
corps
set
aside
for
this
surprise
were
infante
and
almanza
both
regiments
of
la

army
from

which
had
not
yet
drawn
their
sabres
since
the
war
commenced
colonel
subervie
of
the
chasseurs
advancing
with
heedless
confidence
to
charge
the
body
of
spaniards
in
front
of
him
suddenly
saw
himself
enveloped
and
surrounded
by
the
two
regiments
placed
in
ambush
there
was
a
furious
in
which
the
chasseurs
lost
one
officer
and
men
killed
and
about
seventy
more
wounded
before
they
could
cut
their
way
out
of
the
snare
the
sight
of
lasalle
s
main
body
coming
up
in
haste
to
the
rescue
made
henestrosa
give
the
order
for
a
prompt
retreat
which
he
accomplished
without
loss
we
arrived
writes
a
french
officer
of
one
of
the
supporting
regiments
too
late
and
saw
nothing
but
a
cloud
of
dust
in
the
distance
made
by
the
spaniards
as
they
rode
away
and
the
colonel
of
the
tearing
his
hair
at
the
sight
of
his
numerous
wounded
this
lesson
taught
lasalle
more
caution
it
was
creditable
to
henestrosa
though
it
must
be
confessed
that
he
had
two
men
to
one
in
the
skirmish
in
addition
to
the
advantage
of
taking
his
enemy
by
surprise
oddly
enough
the
regiments
which
accomplished
this
successful
on
the
were
the
same
which
behaved
worst
in
the
great
battle
of
the
next
week
rocca
see
pp
at
miajadas
where
this
skirmish
had
taken
place
the
road
descending
from
the
pass
of
santa
cruz
forks
in
two
directions
one
branch
goes
towards
merida
and
badajoz
the
other
and
less
important
to
medellin
la
serena
and
the
upper
guadiana
it
would
have
been
natural
for
cuesta
to
take
the
former
route
which
brought
him
nearer
to
his
base
at
badajoz
and
at
the
same
time
enabled
him
to
cover
the
main
road
to
andalusia
at
which
victor
was
presumably
aiming
but
the
old
general
left
this
line
unprotected
and
retired
by
the
eastern
path
to
medellin
his
main
object
was
to
secure
his
junction
with
the
reinforcements
from
la
mancha
which
albuquerque
was
bringing
to
him
they
were
nearing
la
serena
and
would
be
cut
off
from
him
if
he
took
the
road
to
badajoz
at
the
same
time
he
argued
that
as
he
had
thus
placed
himself
on
the
flank
of
the
french
they
could
not
afford
to
march
past
him
since
the
moment
that
they
left
merida
behind
them
he
would
be
enabled
to
cut
their
communications
with
madrid
he
imagined
that
victor
would
prefer
to
fight
him
and
would
not
dare
either
to
take
in
hand
the
siege
of
badajoz
or
to
advance
against
andalusia
without
clearing
his
flank
by
a
general
action
the
moment
that
he
should
have
picked
up
albuquerque
cuesta
was
prepared
to
indulge
the
enemy
with
a
fight
and
if
he
were
not
attacked
himself
he
intended
to
take
the
offensive
this
was
sheer
madness
even
when
he
had
drawn
in
his
last
reserves
the
old
general
had
but
foot
and
horse
a
number
which
only
exceeded
victor
s
total
by
three
or
four
thousand
men
because
the
latter
had
been
dropping
detachments
between
almaraz
and
merida
considering
the
relative
value
of
the
individual
soldiery
of
the
two
armies
cuesta
s
behaviour
was
that
of
a
criminal
lunatic
we
shall
see
that
his
tactics
were
as
bad
as
his
strategy
the
spanish
statements
that
cuesta
had
only
horse
seem
disproved
by
a
letter
from
cuesta
s
camp
d
urban
to
cradock
april
to
the
effect
that
cuesta
had
already
rallied
after
medellin
fully
horse
but
only
or
foot
record
office
the
marshal
had
left
the
two
dutch
battalions
of
leval
s
division
at
truxillo
in
charge
of
his
sick
he
dropped
the
dragoons
of
s
division
at
miajadas
to
guard
the
and
sent
out
the
and
from
the
same
division
along
the
upper
guadiana
where
they
soon
learnt
of
cuesta
s
presence
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
lasalle
s
light
horse
rode
down
to
merida
and
occupied
the
old
roman
capital
of
western
spain
without
having
to
strike
a
blow
learning
that
the
spaniards
had
not
retreated
in
this
direction
but
by
the
eastern
road
the
marshal
as
cuesta
had
supposed
likely
directed
the
bulk
of
his
infantry
on
medellin
only
the
division
of
ruffin
remained
behind
at
the
of
miajadas
meanwhile
cuesta
had
evacuated
medellin
and
fallen
back
to
la
serena
where
albuquerque
joined
him
on
the
the
moment
that
the
army
was
united
he
turned
back
and
retraced
his
steps
towards
his
former
position
on
the
he
reached
the
town
of
don
benito
only
five
miles
from
medellin
and
learnt
to
his
great
pleasure
that
victor
was
before
him
and
quite
ready
to
fight
the
marshal
had
swept
the
whole
with
his
numerous
cavalry
during
the
last
four
days
and
discovering
that
there
was
no
spanish
force
opposite
him
in
any
direction
save
that
of
la
serena
had
ordered
lasalle
and
ruffin
to
march
up
and
join
him
from
merida
and
miajadas
on
the
morning
of
the
he
had
his
entire
army
united
save
the
two
dutch
battalions
left
at
truxillo
two
more
of
leval
s
battalions
left
at
merida
the
dragoons
at
miajadas
and
one
other
cavalry
regiment
which
had
been
told
off
to
guard
the
bridge
of
almaraz
he
can
not
have
had
less
than
infantry
and
horse
even
when
allowance
is
made
for
the
sick
and
the
losses
at
meza
de
ibor
and
miajadas
cuesta
outnumbered
him
by
infantry
but
was
overmatched
in
cavalry
by
more
than
three
to
two
since
he
had
but
sabres
and
even
more
hopelessly
in
artillery
since
victor
had
brought
over
fifty
guns
to
the
field
while
he
had
only
thirty
frankfort
and
the
of
hesse
see
sausez
s
de
having
been
joined
in
the
early
morning
by
lasalle
s
and
ruffin
s
detachments
victor
had
drawn
out
his
army
in
front
of
medellin
when
his
cavalry
brought
him
the
news
of
the
approach
of
the
spaniards
medellin
an
ancient
town
dominated
by
a
moorish
citadel
on
a
lofty
hill
lies
in
the
angle
between
the
river
guadiana
and
the
hortiga
torrent
the
latter
easily
fordable
in
march
and
dry
in
june
is
an
insignificant
stream
but
flows
at
the
bottom
of
a
steep
ravine
the
guadiana
on
the
other
hand
is
a
river
of
the
first
class
the
great
bridge
which
leads
into
medellin
is
no
less
than
yards
long
there
were
several
fords
from
the
bridge
but
in
march
when
the
river
was
high
it
is
doubtful
whether
they
were
practicable
victor
s
line
drawn
in
a
quarter
of
a
circle
from
the
hortiga
to
the
guadiana
was
well
protected
on
either
flank
by
the
broad
river
and
the
steep
ravine
his
order
of
battle
was
rather
odd
its
front
line
was
composed
of
a
division
of
infantry
villatte
s
of
twelve
battalions
in
the
centre
with
two
projecting
wings
each
composed
of
a
cavalry
division
supported
by
two
battalions
of
leval
s
germans
on
the
right
near
the
hortiga
was
with
five
of
his
six
regiments
of
dragoons
and
ten
horse
artillery
guns
on
the
left
beside
the
guadiana
was
lasalle
with
three
of
his
own
light
cavalry
regiments
and
the
hussars
of
victor
s
the
remaining
battalion
of
leval
s
division
was
with
villatte
in
the
centre
ruffin
s
division
forming
the
reserve
lay
far
to
the
rear
on
the
further
side
of
the
hortiga
he
had
with
him
one
cavalry
regiment
and
a
reserve
of
artillery
one
battalion
was
detached
to
guard
the
baggage
which
was
parked
at
the
below
the
town
the
sixth
regiment
dragoons
was
still
absent
at
miajadas
the
division
had
started
with
nine
battalions
but
two
as
will
be
remembered
were
left
behind
at
truxillo
and
two
more
at
merida
those
with
lasalle
were
the
two
baden
battalions
those
with
a
nassau
battalion
and
one
formed
of
the
united
light
companies
of
the
division
the
second
nassau
battalion
was
to
the
rear
with
villatte
see
sémélé
s
narrative
chasseurs
of
the
of
the
corps
victor
s
army
therefore
formed
a
short
and
compact
arc
of
a
circle
a
mile
and
a
half
outside
of
medellin
facing
him
three
or
four
miles
away
was
the
spanish
army
ranged
in
a
much
larger
arc
also
extending
from
the
hortiga
to
the
guadiana
in
front
of
the
town
of
don
benito
it
was
deployed
along
a
series
of
gentle
heights
on
either
side
of
the
main
road
from
medellin
the
position
though
rather
long
for
the
spanish
numbers
presented
many
advantages
for
a
defensive
battle
but
it
was
cuesta
s
intention
to
go
forward
not
to
receive
the
attack
of
the
french
he
saw
with
pleasure
that
the
enemy
had
come
to
meet
him
and
was
about
to
fight
with
a
difficult
defile
the
bridge
of
medellin
in
his
rear
secure
from
being
outflanked
by
victor
s
numerous
cavalry
for
the
two
streams
covered
his
wings
he
resolved
to
march
straight
before
him
and
to
bear
down
the
french
line
by
a
direct
frontal
attack
on
his
left
were
the
divisions
of
del
parque
and
henestrosa
eight
battalions
in
a
single
line
all
deployed
four
deep
they
had
no
supports
whatever
save
one
battalion
of
grenadiers
which
marched
behind
their
centre
on
their
outside
flank
rode
three
regiments
of
cavalry
close
to
the
ravine
of
the
hortiga
the
centre
was
composed
of
the
four
battalions
of
the
division
of
trias
all
drawn
up
in
the
same
fashion
as
the
left
wing
the
right
was
formed
by
portago
s
incomplete
division
only
three
battalions
and
by
the
contingent
from
la
mancha
which
albuquerque
had
just
brought
up
seven
strong
battalions
with
bayonets
outside
albuquerque
s
extreme
right
and
on
the
banks
of
the
guadiana
was
placed
a
cavalry
force
corresponding
to
that
on
the
extreme
left
and
also
formed
of
three
regiments
a
few
remaining
squadrons
of
cavalry
were
posted
in
the
intervals
between
the
wings
and
the
centre
the
artillery
went
forward
each
battery
with
the
division
to
which
it
was
attached
this
was
a
most
extraordinary
order
of
battle
with
the
object
of
securing
his
flanks
and
of
covering
the
whole
space
between
the
rivers
cuesta
was
advancing
with
a
front
of
nearly
four
miles
and
a
depth
of
only
four
men
there
is
no
parallel
in
modern
history
for
such
a
dangerous
array
if
any
single
point
in
the
long
line
gave
way
there
was
no
reserve
with
which
to
fill
the
gap
and
save
the
day
and
it
was
morally
certain
that
a
weak
point
would
be
found
somewhere
for
many
of
the
battalions
were
raw
troops
which
had
never
seen
fire
and
the
greater
part
of
the
others
had
graduated
in
the
school
of
panic
under
belvedere

juan
these
were

however
was
eminently
satisfied
with
himself
and
with
his
order
of
battle
he
intended
to
envelop
the
shorter
french

with
converging
fire
to
thrust
it
back
on
to
the
defile
of

and
if
possible
to
seize
the

its
left
flank
and
to
endeavour
to
cut
off

retreat
blind
could
go
no
further
when
victor
advanced
from
medellin
he
was
aware
of
the
proximity
of
the
spaniards
and
could
see
their
cavalry
vedettes
on
all
the
hills
in
front
of
don
benito
but
it
was
not
till
his
army
had
marched
some
distance
across
the
bare
and
level
fields
that
cuesta
revealed
his
order
of
battle
when
the
french
were
well
advanced
in
the
plain
the
whole
army
of
estremadura
crowned
the
heights
and
then
swept
downward
from
them
in
one
continuous
line
forming
an
exact
quarter
of
a
circle
the
infantry
was
well
closed
up
each
regiment
had
its
mounted
officers
in
front
and
the
generals
were
riding
up
and
down
the
line
perpetually
supervising
the
dressing
of
their
battalions
for
they
were
quite
conscious
that
in
the
order
which
cuesta
had
chosen
any
gap
or
wavering
in
the
line
would
be
ruinous
each
division
had
its
battery
in
front
and
in
the
long
intervals
between
the
guns
a
very
thick
line
of
skirmishers
covered
the
advance
of
the
main
body
facing
this
imposing
line
as
it
will
be
remembered
the
french
had
the
five
dragoon
regiments
of

the
right
and
the
four
light
cavalry
regiments
of

on
the
left
each
supported
by

s
german
battalions
the
centre
under
villatte
was
somewhat
refused

was
much
farther
from
the
spaniards
than
were
the
two
powerful
wings
of
cavalry
as
the
enemy
advanced
victor
bade
and
lasalle
to
seize
any
good
opportunity
for
a
charge
but
not
to
risk
unless
circumstances
favoured
them
a
general
attack
on
the
spaniards
until
they
should
have
begun
to
lose
their
order
the
wings
of
the
enemy
being
covered
by
the
two
rivers
there
could
be
no
question
of
flank
attacks
and
frontal
charges
by
cavalry
on
unbroken
infantry
are
proverbially
dangerous
when
however
the
armies
drew
near
thought
that
he
saw
his
chance

bade
one
of
his
brigades

in

centre
of

charging
line
the
battalions
on
each
side
stood
firm
and
opened
a
heavy
fire
and
the
dragoons
went
to
the
rear
in
disorder
their
flight
exposed
the
flank
of
the
two
german
battalions
which
formed
the
centre
of
s
line
the
spanish
infantry
pressed
forward
and
engaged
them
with
vigour
this
determined
victor
to
order
his
right
wing
to
fall
back
and
to
get
into
line
with
villatte
before
making
another
stand
accordingly
retired
his
unbroken
regiments
moving
off
in
very
good
order
but
suffering
considerably
from
the
fire
of
the
spanish
skirmishers
who
ran
forward
with
great
rapidity
and
pressed
them
hard
the
retreat
of
the
right
wing
made
it
necessary
for
lasalle
on
the
left
to
conform
to
the
general
movement
he
also
began
to
draw
back
towards
medellin
for
two
hours
writes
one
of
his
officers
we
gave
back
slowly
and
quietly
facing
about
at
every
fifty
yards
to
show
a
front
and
to
dispute
the
ground
amid
the
endless
whizzing
of
bullets
flying
over
our
heads
and
the
deafening
roar
of
the
shells
which
rent
the
air
and
tore
up
the
earth
around
us
we
heeded
only
the
voice
of
our
commanders
the
further
we
retired
the
louder
shouted
our
foes
their
skirmishers
were
so
numerous
and
daring
that
they
sometimes
compelled
ours
to
fall
back
for
protection
into
our
ranks
they
kept
calling
to
us
from
a
distance
that
no
quarter
should
be
given
and
that
medellin
should
be
the
frenchman
s
grave
general
lasalle
was
riding
backward
and
forward
in
front
of
his
division
with
a
lofty
fearless
air
in
the
space
which
separated
us
there
might
be
seen
the
horses
of
disabled
friends
and
foes
running
on
every
side
most
of
them
wounded
some
of
them
dragging
their
dead
masters
by
the
stirrup
and
struggling
to
free
themselves
from
the
unmanageable
rocca
of
the
hussars
de
la
guerre
d
in
this
fashion
the
french
retired
before
the
advancing
army
of
cuesta
till
they
drew
near
the
point
where
victor
intended
to
make
his
stand
the
right
wing
reached
the
new
line
of
defence
first
it
halted
on
the
crest
of
the
to
the
north
of
the
point
where
villatte
s
infantry
stood
the
marshal
placed
ten
guns
in
line
ordered
the
two
german
battalions
to
stand
firm
on
each
flank
of
the
artillery
and
sent
up
the
of
the
line
from
villatte
s
division
to
aid
them
as
well
as
a
battalion
of
picked
grenadiers
s
horsemen
now
all
in
good
order
again
covered
their
flanks
then
came
the
critical
moment
of
the
battle
if
the
spaniards
could
still
push
their
advance
and
thrust
back
the
french
infantry
victor
s
position
would
be
very
serious
for
a
moment
it
seemed
that
they
might
succeed
the
battalions
of
henestrosa
and
del
parque
came
forward
with
a
steadiness
that
spanish
troops
had
not
yet
often
shown
during
the
war
they
closed
upon
the
guns
in
spite
of
their
rapid
fire
and
attacked
the
three
battalions
on
their
flanks
which
had
been
thrown
into
square
for
fear
of
cavalry
attacks
and
were
therefore
not
in
very
good
order
for
defending
themselves
against
infantry
the
leading
spanish
officers
had
actually
ridden
into
the
battery
and
were
cutting
down
the
gunners
when
ordered
his
dragoons
to
charge
the
moment
that
he
saw
them
on
the
move
cuesta
who
had
been
riding
on
this
flank
with
the
three
regiments
of
cavalry
which
covered
the
end
of
his
line
ordered
a
against
the
flank
of
the
advancing
french
then
followed
a
disgraceful
scene
the
spanish
squadrons
rode
forward
in
an
irresolute
way
for
a
few
score
yards
and
then
suddenly
halted
turned
and
galloped
to
the
rear
in
a
disorderly
mass
before
they
had
arrived
anywhere
near
the
french
dragoons
they
collided
with
cuesta
upset
him
and
rode
over
him
the
old
man
was
with
difficulty
saved
and
set
upon
his
horse
by
his
the
fugitives
never
drew
rein
and
fled
far
away
to
the
north
almost
without
losing
a
man
their
conduct
was
all
the
more
disgraceful
because
two
of
the
three
regiments
were
old
troops
from
the
baltic
which
had
come
back
with
la
romana
and
had
not
shared
in
any
of
the
early
disasters
of
the
spanish
armies
cuesta
in
his
dispatch
mentions
that
general
henestrosa
captain
yturrigarey
and
the
english
benjamin
d
urban
were
the
first
three
into
the
battery
in
a
dispatch
in
the
record
office
cuesta
says
that
the
particular
corps
which
rode
down
himself
and
his
staff
was
the
raw
toledo
regiment
the
result
of
this
shameful
panic
was
instant
disaster
to
the
whole
spanish
right
wing
of
s
division
one
brigade
went
off
in
pursuit
of
the
routed
cavalry
but
the
other
three
regiments
charged
in
flank
the
battalions
of
henestrosa
and
del
parque
just
as
they
stormed
the
french
battery
on
which
they
were
intent
a
long
line
without
supports
such
as
that
which
these
two
divisions
presented
was
helpless
when
attacked
by
cavalry
on
the
flank
it
suffered
exactly
the
same
fate
which
befell
colborne
s
brigade
at
albuera
two
years
later
while
engaged
in
front
with
the
three
battalions
already
before
it
and
with
the
regiment
which
villatte
had
sent
up
to
aid
them
it
could
not
throw
back
its
flank
to
face
the
horsemen
nor
had
it
any
reserve
whatever
that
could
be
utilized
to
hold
off
the
whole
line
was
rolled
up
and
dashed
into
atoms
many
men
were
cut
down
a
few
captured
the
remainder
fled
in
utter
disorder
towards
the
north
the
french
urged
the
pursuit
with
cruel
vigour
merciless
all
the
more
because
they
had
for
a
moment
doubted
of
their
victory
while
this
struggle
was
raging
on
the
northern
part
of
the
field
lasalle
had
been
still
falling
back
before
the
divisions
of
albuquerque
portago
and
trias
across
the
plain
which
borders
the
guadiana
the
spanish
line
were
still
moving
forward
with
great
steadiness
but
had
begun
to
fall
into
a
sort
of
formation
with
the
cavalry
near
the
river
most
in
advance
the
infantry
of
albuquerque
a
little
behind
and
the
estremaduran
battalions
of
the
centre
still
further
to
the
rear
the
fact
was
that
general
eguia
to
whom
cuesta
had
given
the
charge
of
his
whole
right
wing
was
trying
to
edge
his
cavalry
between
lasalle
and
the
guadiana
in
order
to
cut
him
off
from
the
bridge
of
medellin
this
end
of
the
line
therefore
was
pushing
forward
very
rapidly
while
trias
on
the
other
hand
was
coming
forward
rather
slowly
from
a
desire
not
to
lose
touch
with
del
parque
s
division
the
nearest
troops
to
him
in
the
other
half
of
the
army
lasalle
was
keeping
an
anxious
eye
on
the
development
of
the
action
further
to
the
north
and
the
moment
that
he
saw
halt
and
prepare
to
charge
followed
his
example
his
first
blow
was
delivered
at
the
cavalry
next
the
river
he
flung
against
them
the
hussars
with
a
chasseur
regiment
in
support
these
two
corps
charging
with
great
fury
easily
broke
the
andalusian
lancers
who
were
leading
the
pursuit
and
hurled
them
back
upon
the
other
squadrons
of
the
spanish
right
the
whole
body
was
thrown
into
disorder
and
driven
off
the
field
leaving
the
flank
of
albuquerque
s
division
completely
uncovered
lasalle
then
his
men
and
prepared
to
charge
the
infantry
he
had
been
reinforced
meanwhile
by
one
of
villatte
s
brigades
and
of
the
line
and
by
the
one
battalion
of
leval
s
germans
which
had
hitherto
remained
with
the
centre
while
these
seven
battalions
of
fresh
troops
delivered
a
frontal
attack
on
albuquerque
and
trias
lasalle
hurled
his
four
regiments
of
cavalry
upon
their
unprotected
right
flank
the
spaniards
were
doomed
to
destruction
but
for
some
time
kept
up
a
show
of
resistance
albuquerque
had
got
two
or
three
of
his
battalions
out
of
line
into
column
and
for
a
moment
these
held
back
lasalle
s
chasseurs
but
the
fight
lasted
for
a
few
minutes
only
a
new
french
force
was
coming
up
returning
from
the
pursuit
of
cuesta
with
two
of
his
dragoon
regiments
appeared
upon
the
flank
and
rear
of
trias
division
and
charged
in
upon
it
from
behind
this
last
assault
was
decisive
the
whole
spanish
line
broke
up
and
fled
eastward
over
the
open
ground
along
the
river
the
six
regiments
of
french
cavalry
were
soon
in
pursuit
and
rode
in
among
the
flying
horde
using
the
sabre
with
reckless
cruelty
and
far
more
intent
on
slaughter
than
on
taking
prisoners
lasalle
s
chasseurs
were
specially
savage
having
to
avenge
the
bloody
check
which
they
had
received
at
miajadas
in
the
preceding
week
our
troops
says
a
french
witness
who
had
been
threatened
with
no
quarter
by
the
spaniards
if
they
had
been
overpowered
and
who
were
enraged
by
five
hours
of
preliminary
fighting
at
first
spared
no
one
the
infantry
following
behind
at
a
distance
dispatched
the
wounded
with
their
bayonets
most
of
all
they
were
pitiless
to
such
of
the
spanish
regiments
as
were
without
a
proper
military
uniform
another
describes
the
pursuit
as
one
continuous
slaughter
till
night
some
of
the
spanish
battalions
dispersed
in
the
most
helpless
confusion
and
fled
in
all
directions
when
the
line
was
broken
others
tried
to
close
up
and
to
defend
themselves
this
made
their
flight
slower
and
sometimes
led
to
their
complete
extermination
rocca
says
that
he
saw
the
two
regiments
of
spanish
and
walloon
guards
lying
dead
in
the
order
which
they
had
occupied
at
the
moment
of
the
breaking
of
the
line
the
statement
is
borne
out
at
least
as
to
the
walloons
by
the
fact
that
the
next
of
cuesta
s
army
which
has
been
preserved
shows
that
regiment
with
only
men
surviving
out
of
two
whole
battalions
if
any
of
the
infantry
of
the
spanish
right
wing
escaped
at
all
it
was
partly
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
two
cavalry
regiments
in
the
centre
of
the
line
showed
a
much
better
spirit
than
their
comrades
on
the
wings
and
protected
the
flight
of
some
battalions
moreover
a
frightful
thunderstorm
swept
over
the
plains
late
in
the
afternoon
darkened
the
whole
horizon
and
caused
the
french
squadrons
to
halt
and
cease
their
pursuit
french
authorities
speak
of
the
wrath
of
the
chasseurs
as
justifiable
because
their
comrades
at
miajadas
had
been
murdered
or
but
the
spaniards
had
killed
them
in
fair
fight
rocca
see
the
table
in
arteche
vi
these
were
the
hussar
regiments
volunteers
of
spain
and
estremadura
late
maria
luisa
cuesta
says
in
his
dispatch
that
they
saved
the
battalions
of
merida
and
provincial
of
badajoz
which
had
been
surrounded
and
nearly
cut
off
illustration
battle
of
medellin
march
the
slaughter
nevertheless
had
been
terrible
of
the
men
whom
the
spaniards
lost
on
this
fatal
day
fell
by
the
edge
of
the
sword
only
prisoners
were
sent
back
to
talavera
and
even
if
some
others
had
succeeded
in
escaping
during
their
march
to
the
rear
it
is
certain
that
the
spanish
amounted
to
at
least
men
nine
standards
were
taken
less
than
might
have
been
expected
for
the
spanish
battalions
present
must
have
brought
to
the
field
twenty
pieces
of
artillery
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
french
out
of
the
thirty
which
cuesta
had
possessed
some
few
batteries
therefore
perhaps
the
horse
artillery
of
the
evasive
cavalry
brigades
had
succeeded
in
escaping
from
the
rout
most
french
authors
unite
in
stating
that
the
total
loss
on
their
side
was
only
men
this
figure
is
as
absurd
as
that
given
for
soult
s
losses
at
corunna
there
were
five
hours
of
fighting
and
for
a
long
time
the
battle
had
gone
by
no
means
in
favour
of
victor
s
men
it
is
improbable
that
they
suffered
less
than
casualties
and
the
figure
may
have
been
higher
for
one
brigade
of
s
dragoons
was
beaten
back
while
charging
guns
always
a
bloody
business
for
cavalry
while
the
german
battalions
which
retired
across
the
plain
in
column
played
on
by
artillery
and
harassed
by
skirmishers
must
also
have
suffered
severely
this
is
the
figure
given
by
jourdan
and
general
sémélé
who
ought
to
have
known
the
facts
it
is
of
course
reproduced
by
thiers
and
the
other
historians
but
i
agree
with
napier
ii
in
considering
the
figure
scarcely
rocca
says
that
the
french
lost
men
but
from
the
context
i
suspect
this
to
be
a
misprint
for
schepeler
always
a
very
and
impartial
writer
guesses
at
and
he
may
not
be
far
wrong
cuesta
s
cavalry
owing
to
the
disgraceful
cowardice
shown
by
the
majority
of
the
regiments
had
got
off
comparatively
intact
the
whole
of
his
dreadful
losses
had
fallen
on
his
infantry
and
they
had
been
scattered
so
far
and
wide
over
the
estremaduran
plain
that
it
was
many
days
before
he
could
get
together
a
respectable
force
he
took
refuge
at
monasterio
in
the
mountains
in
the
direction
of
andalusia
and
sent
urgent
appeals
for
reinforcements
to
the
central
junta
it
might
have
been
expected
that
the
junta
would
disgrace
him
and
remove
him
from
command
as
they
had
cartaojal
infantado
and
castaños
but
apparently
they
were
rather
cheered
by
the
fact
that
cuesta
had
seriously
disputed
the
victory
with
the
french
than
angered
with
the
want
of
generalship
which
he
had
shown
they
voted
that
he
and
his
army
had
deserved
well
of
the
state
and
distributed
honours
and
promotion
to
all
the
officers
whom
he
recommended
for
good
conduct
during
the
action

that
they
must
have
had
in
their
minds

the
consul
varro
for
not
having
despaired
of
the
republic
instead
of
removing
him
for
rashness
and
incompetence
at
any
rate
they
conferred
on
cuesta
the
post
of
of
estremadura
and
hurried
up
to
reinforce
him
all
the
troops
that
they
could
spare
a
strong

from

consisting
of
nine

with

the

the

with
watching

to

the
corps
which
should
attempt
to
molest
the
capital
of
estremadura
instead
of
attacking
the
place
victor
contented
himself
with
sending
to
it
vain
summonses
to
surrender
and
with
endeavouring
to
discover
whether
it
might
not
contain
traitors
ready
to
negotiate
with
king
joseph
he
brought
down
from
madrid
as
his
agent
a
spanish
magistrate
named
sotelo
who
had
become
a
zealous
through
this
person
he
addressed
letters
both
to
the
governor
of
badajoz
and
to
the
central
junta
at
seville
after
setting
forth
all
the
evils
which
the
continuance
of
the
war
was
bringing
upon
spain
sotelo
stated
that
his
king
was
ready
to
grant
the
most
liberal
and
benevolent
terms
to
the
junta
in
order
to
spare
further
effusion
of
blood
the
letter
was
duly
forwarded
to
seville
where
it
was
laid
before
the
government
the
ironical
answer
was
promptly
returned
that
if
sotelo
possessed
full
powers
to
negotiate
for
peace
on
the
basis
of
the
restoration
of
ferdinand
vii
and
the
prompt
evacuation
of
spain
by
the
french
armies
peace
would
be
possible
if
not
the
junta
must
continue
to
carry
out
the
mandate
conferred
upon
it
by
the
nation
according
to
which
it
could
conclude
no
truce
or
treaty
except
on
the
two
conditions
stated
sotelo
tried
to
continue
the
negotiation
but
his
offers
were
disregarded
and
victor
soon
realized
that
he
would
obtain
no
further
advantages
save
by
his
sword
he
remained
at
merida
waiting
in
vain
for
the
news
of
soult
s
advance
on
lisbon
which
was
according
to
napoleon
s
orders
to
be
the
signal
for
the
corps
to
resume
its
advance
for
the
campaign
of
medellin

used
the

of

very
inaccurate

soult
s
invasion
of
portugal
chapter
i
soult
s
preliminary
operations
in
galicia
january
after
the
departure
of
bonaparte
for
paris
there
were
as
we
have
already
shown
only
two
points
in
the
peninsula
where
the
strength
of
the
french
armies
was
such
as
to
allow
them
to
continue
the
great
movement
of
advance
which
their
master
had
begun
we
have
already
seen
how
victor
after
advancing
from
the
tagus
to
the
guadiana
found
his
initiative
exhausted
even
after
his
victory
at
medellin
he
had
halted
and
refused
to
take
the
offensive
against
lisbon
or
andalusia
till
he
should
be
heavily
reinforced
it
remains
to
be
seen
how
the
other
french
army
available
for
immediate
field
operations
had
fared
moore
s
daring
march
and
the
ensuing
retreat
had
drawn
up
into
the
extreme
of
the
peninsula
the
and
d
of
these
the
had
been
dissolved
at
the
new
year
and
the
bulk
of
its
battalions
had
been
transferred
to
soult
s
corps
which
on
january
had
a
nominal
effective
of
more
than
men
ney
s
corps
the
was
much
smaller
and
does
not
seem
to
have
amounted
to
more
than
or
sabres
and
bayonets
but
between
astorga
the
rearmost
point
occupied
by
ney
and
corunna
which
soult
s
vanguard
had
entered
on
january
there
were
on
paper
men
available
for
active
operations
nor
had
they
to
guard
their
own
communications
with
madrid
or
with
france
lapisse
s
numerous
division
had
been
left
at
salamanca
there
was
a
provisional
brigade
at
leon
bonnet
held
santander
with
another
division
there
were
detachments
in
zamora
valladolid
and
the
other
chief
towns
of
the
douro
valley
somewhat
later
in
april
the
emperor
moved
another
whole
army
corps
that
of
mortier
into
old
castile
when
it
became
available
after
the
fall
of
saragossa
even
without
this
reinforcement
he
thought
that
the
rear
of
the
army
in
galicia
was
adequately
covered
the
parting
instructions
of
bonaparte
to
soult
have
already
been
cited
when
the
english
should
have
embarked
the
duke
of
dalmatia
was
to
march
on
oporto
and
ten
days
later
was
to
occupy
lisbon
we
have
already
seen
that
the
scheme
of
dates
which
napoleon
laid
down
for
these
operations
was
impossible
even
to
the
borders
of
absurdity
oporto
was
to
be
seized
by
february
and
lisbon
by
february
but
putting
aside
this
error
which
was
due
to
his
persistent
habit
of
ignoring
the
physical
conditions
of
spanish
roads
and
spanish
weather
the
emperor
had
drawn
up
a
plan
which
seemed
feasible
enough
ney
s
corps
was
to
move
up
and
occupy
all
the
chief
strategical
points
in
galicia
taking
over
both
the
garrison
duty
and
the
task
of
stamping
out
any
small
lingering
insurrections
in
the
interior
this
would
leave
soult
free
to
employ
the
whole
of
his
four
divisions
of
infantry
and
his
three
divisions
of
cavalry
for
the
invasion
of
portugal
even
allowing
for
the
usual
wastage
of
men
in
a
winter
campaign
the
emperor
must
have
supposed
that
with
a
nominal
effective
of
men
soult
would
be
able
to
provide
more
than
efficients
for
the
expedition
against
lisbon
considering
that
the
portuguese
army
was
still
in
the
making
and
that
no
more
than
british
troops
remained
in
and
about
lisbon
the
task
assigned
to
the
duke
of
dalmatia
did
not
on
the
face
of
it
appear
unreasonable
it
was
composed
of
the
few
battalions
of
the
corps
which
had
not
been
drafted
into
the
when
the
emperor
looked
at
the
returns
of
the
army
which
were
forwarded
to
him
as
regularly
as
possible
and
which
pursued
him
wheresoever
he
might
go
he
must
have
seen
the
following
statistics
those
of
in
the
french
war
office
for
the
corps
taking
the
gross
totals
infantry
merle
mermet
delaborde
heudelet
total
cavalry
lorges
lahoussaye
franceschi
total
artillery
and
train
total
of
the
whole
corps
by
it
had
risen
to
but
in
spain
the
old
saying
that
nothing
is
so
deceptive
as
figures
except
facts
was
true
no
map
those
of
were
intolerably
bad
could
give
the
emperor
any
idea
of
the
hopeless
condition
of
galician
or
portuguese
in
january
no
tables
of
statistics
could
enable
him
to
foresee
the
way
in
which
the
population
would
receive
the
invading
army
we
may
add
that
even
an
unrivalled
knowledge
of
the
realities
of
war
would
hardly
have
prepared
him
to
expect
that
the
campaign
of
galicia
would
in
one
month
have
worn
down
soult
s
available
effectives
to
a
bare
men
such
was
the
modest
figure
at
which
the
corps
stood
on
january
for
it
had
no
less
than
men
detached
and
the
incredible
number
of
over
one
man
in
four
in
hospital
for
this
figure
it
was
not
the
muskets
of
moore
s
host
which
were
responsible
it
was
the
cold
and
misery
of
the
forced
marches
from
astorga
to
corunna
which
seem
to
have
tried
the
pursuer
even
more
than
the
pursued
the
detached
were
strung
out
in
small
parties
all
the
way
from
leon
to
lugo
wherever
the
marshal
had
been
obliged
to
abandon
stores
or
baggage
that
could
not
travel
fast
he
had
been
forced
to
leave
a
guard
he
had
also
dropped
small
garrisons
at
villafranca
lugo
and
betanzos
to
await
ney
s
arrival
but
the
most
important
drain
had
been
that
of
his
dismounted
dragoons
in
his
cavalry
regiments
half
the
horses
had
foundered
or
perished
the
roads
so
deadly
to
moore
s
chargers
had
taken
a
corresponding
toll
from
the
french
divisions
and
at
every
hundreds
of
horsemen
unable
to
keep
up
with
the
main
body
had
been
left
behind
in
any
other
country
than
spain
these
involuntary
laggards
would
have
found
their
way
to
the
front
again
in
a
comparatively
short
time
but
soult
was
commencing
to
discover
that
one
of
the
main
features
of
war
in
the
peninsula
was
that
isolated
men
or
even
small
parties
could
not
move
about
in
safety
the
peasantry
were
already
beginning
to
rise
even
before
moore
s
army
took
its
departure
they
actually
cut
the
road
between
betanzos
and
lugo
and
between
lugo
and
villafranca
within
a
few
days
after
the
battle
of
corunna
this
forced
the
stragglers
to
mass
under
pain
of
being
assassinated
hundreds
of
them
were
actually
cut
off
the
rest
gathered
in
small
wayside
garrisons
and
could
not
get
on
till
they
had
been
formed
into
parties
of
considerable
strength
the
rearmost
who
had
been
collected
at
astorga
by
general
pierre
soult
the
marshal
s
brother
did
not
join
the
corps
for
months
and
this
body
was
no
less
than
or
strong
the
other
detachments
could
not
make
their
way
to
corunna
even
when
marshal
ney
had
come
up
it
was
only
by
degrees
and
after
delays
covering
whole
weeks
that
they
began
to
rejoin
the
only
solid
reinforcement
received
by
soult
soon
after
the
departure
of
the
english
army
consisted
of
his
rear
division
that
of
heudelet
which
came
up
from
lugo
not
many
days
after
the
battle
of
january
the
state
of
the
cavalry
of
the
corps
on
gives
the
following
astounding
result
under
lorges
lahoussaye
franceschi
the
drain
under
the
second
column
represents
mainly
the
men
who
had
dropped
to
the
rear
from
losing
their
horses
or
being
unable
to
take
them
on
soult
was
still
far
from
suspecting
the
full
difficulty
of
the
task
that
was
before
him
he
had
been
much
encouraged
by
the
tame
way
in
which
the
governor
of
corunna
had
surrendered
on
january
if
alcedo
had
made
the
least
semblance
of
fight
he
could
have
detained
the
marshal
before
his
walls
for
an
indefinite
time
the
city
was
only
approachable
by
a
narrow
and
isthmus
and
the
french
could
not
have
battered
this
formidable
front
to
any
effect
with
the
which
formed
their
only
artillery
the
surrender
of
the
place
gave
soult
some
food
the
considerable
resources
of
a
rich
harbour
town
and
most
important
of
all
a
large
number
of
guns
of
position
suitable
for
use
against
the
other
fortress
which
he
must
take
ere
he
moved
on
against
portugal
this
place
was
ferrol
the
second
naval
arsenal
of
spain
which
faces
corunna
across
the
broad
inlet
of
ares
bay
only
thirteen
miles
distant
by
water
though
the
land
road
thither
by
betanzos
round
the
head
of
the
fiord
is
forty
miles
long
to
make
sure
of
this
place
was
obviously
soult
s
first
duty
if
left
unmolested
it
would
prove
a
dangerous
nucleus
round
which
the
galician
insurgents
could
concentrate
for
it
contained
a
regular
garrison
consisting
of
the
dépôts
and
recruits
of
la
romana
s
army
and
of
or
sailors
there
were
lying
in
the
harbour
mostly
and
unready
for
sea
no
less
than
eight
ships
and
three
frigates
their
crews
much
depleted
but
still
numerous
had
been
landed
to
assist
the
soldiers
in
garrisoning
the
forts
in
addition
several
thousand
citizens
and
peasants
had
taken
arms
for
muskets
abounded
in
ferrol
from
the
stores
lately
received
from
england
with
these
resources
it
is
clear
that
a
governor
of
courage
and
resolution
might
have
made
a
long
defence
they
were
far
greater
than
those
with
which
palafox
had
preserved
saragossa
and
ferrol
was
no
open
town
but
a
fortress
which
had
been
kept
in
good
repair
for
fear
of
the
english
but
for
the
misfortune
of
galicia
the
commander
of
ferrol
admiral
melgarejo
was
a
traitor
at
heart
he
was
one
of
the
old
bureaucrats
who
had
only
followed
the
patriotic
cause
because
it
seemed
for
the
moment
to
be
in
the
ascendant
if
patriotism
did
not
pay
he
was
perfectly
prepared
to
come
to
terms
and
to
do
homage
to
joseph
bonaparte
for
the
state
of
this
squadron
see
the
report
by
admiral
de
courcy
in
the
for
spain
march
the
marines
had
been
taken
away
in
july
and
formed
half
a
brigade
in
the
division
of
the
army
of
galicia
but
the
seamen
were
available
on
january
soult
marched
against
ferrol
with
the
infantry
division
of
mermet
the
dragoons
of
lorges
and
the
heavy
guns
which
he
had
found
in
corunna
he
left
delaborde
in
garrison
at
the
latter
place
posted
merle
at
betanzos
a
house
between
the
two
fortresses
and
directed
franceschi
s
cavalry
division
on
santiago
and
lahoussaye
s
on
mellid
in
order
to
see
whether
there
was
any
spanish
visible
in
western
galicia
on
the
the
marshal
presented
himself
in
front
of
ferrol
and
summoned
the
place
to
surrender
melgarejo
was
determined
not
to
fight
and
several
of
his
chief
subordinates
supported
him
the
armed
citizens
persisted
in
their
idea
of
defending
the
place
but
when
the
french
broke
ground
in
front
of
the
walls
and
captured
two
small
outlying
redoubts
they
allowed
themselves
to
be
overpersuaded
by
their
treacherous
chief
on
january
the
place
surrendered
and
on
the
following
day
soult
was
received
within
the
walls
the
capitulation
had
two
shameful
clauses
by
the
first
the
civil
and
military
authorities
undertook
to
take
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
king
joseph
by
the
second
the
splendid
in
the
harbour
were
handed
over
intact
a
most
valuable
acquisition
for
the
emperor
if
galicia
was
to
remain
under
his
control
any
one
but
a
traitor
would
have
burnt
or
scuttled
them
before
surrendering
but
melgarejo
after
receiving
high
testimonials
from
soult
hastened
up
to
madrid
and
took
office
under
the
along
with
the
squadron
naval
cannon
an
immense
quantity
of
timber
cordage
and
other
stores
and
muskets
newly
imported
from
england
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
french
the
supreme
junta
very
properly
condemned
him
and
alcedo
the
governor
of
corunna
to
the
penalties
of
high
treason
on
the
day
after
ferrol
was
occupied
soult
received
the
last
communication
from
the
emperor
which
was
to
reach
him
for
many
a
day
it
was
dated
from
valladolid
on
january
we
have
already
had
occasion
to
refer
to
it
more
than
once
while
dealing
with
the
controversies
of
king
joseph
and
marshal
victor
this
dispatch
repeated
the
emperor
s
former
orders
with
some
slight
concession
in
the
matter
of
dates
instead
of
reaching
oporto
on
february
the
marshal
was
to
be
granted
four
extra
days
and
after
taking
oporto
on
february
he
was
to
reach
lisbon
on
the
sixteenth
instead
of
the
tenth
soult
was
also
told
that
he
would
not
have
to
depend
on
his
own
resources
alone
victor
with
the
corps
would
be
at
merida
by
the
time
that
the
corps
was
approaching
the
portuguese
capital
he
would
be
instructed
to
send
a
column
in
the
direction
of
lisbon
to
make
a
diversion
in
favour
of
the
attack
from
the
north
and
at
the
same
time
lapisse
from
salamanca
should
move
on
ciudad
rodrigo
and
almeida
bessières
was
so
the
emperor
said
under
strict
orders
to
send
lapisse
forward
into
portugal
the
moment
that
the
news
should
reach
him
that
the
corps
had
captured
oporto
this
combination
sinned
against
the
rules
of
strategy
as
they
had
to
be
practised
in
spain
the
emperor
had
yet
to
realize
that
in
order
to
make
operations
simultaneous
when
troops
starting
from
bases
several
hundred
miles
apart
are
to
it
is
necessary
that
their
generals
should
be
in
free
communication
with
each
other
but
soult
when
he
had
advanced
into
portugal
was
as
much
out
of
touch
with
the
other
french
corps
as
if
he
had
been
operating
in
poland
or
naples
it
was
literally
months
before
accurate
information
as
to
his
situation
and
his
achievements
reached
salamanca
merida
or
madrid
the
movements
of
victor
and
lapisse
being
strictly
conditioned
by
the
receipt
of
news
concerning
soult
s
progress
and
that
news
being
never
received
or
received
too
late
the
combination
never
did
and
never
could
take
place
napoleon
had
forgotten
to
reckon
with
the
ubiquitous
spanish
insurgent
here
as
in
so
many
cases
he
was
unconsciously
assuming
that
the
bearer
of
dispatches
could
ride
freely
through
the
country
as
if
he
were
in
saxony
or
lombardy
and
that
soult
could
make
known
his
movements
and
his
desires
as
often
as
he
pleased
french
critics
of
the
emperor
generally
confine
themselves
to
censuring
him
for
sending
the
corps
to
attempt
unaided
a
task
too
great
for
it
this
is
not
quite
fair
for
he
had
intended
to
support
soult
by
two
strong
diversions
the
real
fault
lay
in
ignoring
the
fact
that
in
spain
combined
operations
which
presuppose
constant
communication
between
the
participants
were
practically
impossible
the
same
error
was
made
in
when
drouet
was
told
to
in
masséna
s
invasion
of
portugal
and
in
when
soult
was
directed
to
lend
a
helping
hand
to
that
same
invasion
it
is
impossible
to
give
effective
aid
to
a
colleague
whose
condition
and
whose
whereabouts
are
unknown

aveugle
on
january
the
duke
of
dalmatia
set
to
work
to
reorganize
his
army
for
the
great
expedition
that
had
been
assigned
to
him
it
was
impossible
to
march
at
once
as
the
emperor
had
commanded
because
ney
had
not
yet
arrived
at
the
front
and
it
was
necessary
to
turn
over
the
charge
of
corunna
and
ferrol
to
him
before
departing
further
south
moreover
there
were
many
other
arrangements
to
be
made
a
base
hospital
had
to
be
organized
at
corunna
for
the
thousands
of
sick
and
wounded
belonging
to
the
corps
its
transport
had
to
be
reconstructed
for
most
of
the
animals
had
died
during
the
forced
marches
in
pursuit
of
moore
a
new
stock
of
munitions
had
to
be
served
out
from
the
stores
so
fortunately
captured
at
ferrol
the
military
chest
of
the
corps
had
been
left
behind
at
astorga
and
showed
no
signs
of
appearing
to
provide
for
the
more
urgent
needs
of
the
army
the
marshal
had
to
squeeze
forced
contributions
out
of
the
already
exhausted
towns
of
corunna
ferrol
and
santiago
which
had
long
ago
contributed
all
their
surplus
resources
to
the
fitting
out
of
blake
s
army
of
galicia
these
same
unhappy
places
had
to
submit
to
a
heavy
requisition
of
cloth
and
leather
for
the
replacing
of
the
garments
and
boots
worn
out
in
the
late
marches
but
even
with
the
aid
of
english
greatcoats
discovered
in
store
at
corunna
and
other
finds
at
ferrol
the
wants
of
the
army
could
not
be
properly
supplied
it
started
on
the
campaign
in
a
very
imperfectly
equipped
condition
the
most
dangerous
point
in
its
outfit
was
the
want
of
mules
most
of
the
valleys
of
inner
galicia
and
northern
portugal
are
destitute
of
carriage
roads
to
bring
up
the
food
and
the
reserve
ammunition
were
absolutely
necessary
and
soult
could
only
collect
a
few
hundreds
even
if
his
men
should
succeed
in
living
on
the
country
and
so
solve
the
problem
of
carrying
provisions
they
could
not
hope
to
pick
up
powder
and
lead
in
the
same
way
when
therefore
the
heavy
baggage
on
wheels
had
to
be
left
behind
the
corps
was
only
able
to
carry
a
very
insufficient
stock
of
cartridges
twice
as
we
shall
see
it
almost
exhausted
its
ammunition
and
was
nearly
brought
to
a
standstill
on
the
way
to
oporto
the
authors
english
and
french
who
express
a
humanitarian
horror
at
the
shooting
of
horses
and
mules
before
the
embarkation
of
moore
s
army
forget
what
a
godsend
these
would
have
been
to
soult
if
the
english
had
left
them
to
fall
intact
into
his
hands
the
slaughter
was
dreadful
but
perfectly
necessary
and
justifiable
all
these
details
come
from
le
noble
who
as
of
the
corps
had
full
experience
of
the
difficulty
of
equipping
it
for
the
portuguese
expedition
it
was
not
till
february
had
already
begun
that
soult
was
able
to
move
forward
the
whole
of
his
army
for
he
refused
to
withdraw
delaborde
s
division
from
corunna
and
mermet
s
from
ferrol
till
ney
should
have
brought
up
troops
of
the
corps
to
relieve
them
the
duke
of
elchingen
though
apprised
of
the
emperor
s
orders
lingered
long
at
lugo
and
it
was
not
till
he
came
down
in
person
to
the
coast
that
soult
could
call
up
his
rear
divisions
meanwhile
a
small
exchange
of
troops
between
the
two
corps
was
carried
out
ney
being
short
of
cavalry
received
a
brigade
of
lorges
dragoons
to
add
to
his
own
inadequate
force
of
two
regiments
of
light
horse
in
return
he
made
over
to
the
corps
three
battalions
of
the
léger
which
had
accompanied
him
hitherto
they
were
added
to
delaborde
s
division
which
had
been
only
eight
battalions
strong
even
before
the
troops
from
ferrol
and
corunna
were
able
to
move
soult
had
put
the
rest
of
his
army
on
the
march
for
portugal
on
january
franceschi
s
light
horsemen
started
along
the
from
santiago
to
vigo
and
tuy
while
further
inland
lahoussaye
s
division
of
dragoons
quitting
mellid
took
the
rough
mountain
path
across
the
monte
testeyro
by
barca
de
ledesma
and
cardelle
which
leads
to
rivadavia
and
salvatierra
on
the
lower
minho
merle
s
and
heudelet
s
infantry
started
several
days
later
and
were
many
miles
behind
the
advanced
cavalry
lahoussaye
s
division
met
with
no
opposition
in
the
rugged
region
which
it
had
to
cross
and
occupied
salvatierra
without
difficulty
franceschi
scattered
a
few
peasants
at
the
defile
of
redondela
outside
vigo
and
then
found
himself
at
the
gates
of
that
the
governor
no
less
weak
and
unpatriotic
than
those
of
ferrol
and
corunna
surrendered
without
firing
a
shot
his
excuse
was
that
he
had
only
recruits
and
armed
townsfolk
to
man
his
walls
and
handle
his
numerous
artillery
but
his
misconduct
was
even
surpassed
by
that
of
the
governor
of
tuy
who
capitulated
to
franceschi
s
horsemen
three
days
later
in
the
same
style
though
he
was
in
command
of
regular
troops
and
was
implored
to
hold
out
by
the
local
junta
throughout
galicia
in
this
unhappy
month
the
officials
and
military
chiefs
showed
a
most
deplorable
spirit
which
contrasted
unfavourably
with
that
of
the
lower
classes
both
in
the
towns
and
the
the
way
to
the
frontier
of
portugal
had
thus
been
opened
with
an
ease
which
seemed
to
justify
napoleon
s
idea
that
the
spaniards
would
not
hold
out
when
once
their
field
armies
had
been
crushed
franceschi
and
lahoussaye
reported
to
the
duke
of
dalmatia
that
they
had
swept
the
whole
northern
bank
of
the
minho
and
that
there
was
nothing
in
front
of
them
save
the
swollen
river
and
a
few
bands
of
portuguese
peasantry
who
were
observing
them
from
valenza
the
dilapidated
frontier
fortress
of
the
neighbouring
kingdom
both
the
french
and
the
galicians
of
the
might
well
have
forgotten
the
fact
that
there
was
still
a
spanish
army
in
existence
within
the
borders
of
the
province
it
is
long
since
we
have
had
occasion
to
mention
the
fugitive
host
of
the
marquis
of
la
romana
after
being
hunted
out
of
ponferrada
by
soult
on
january
he
had
followed
in
the
wake
of
craufurd
s
brigades
on
their
eccentric
retreat
down
the
valley
of
the
sil
but
while
the
british
troops
pushed
on
to
vigo
and
embarked
the
spaniards
halted
at
orense
there
the
marquis
endeavoured
to
rally
his
demoralized
and
starving
host
with
the
aid
of
the
very
limited
resources
of
the
district
he
had
only
men
left
with
the
colours
out
of
the
who
had
been
with
him
at
leon
on
december
but
there
were
several
thousands
more
straggling
after
him
or
dispersed
in
the
side
valleys
off
the
road
which
he
had
followed
most
of
these
men
had
lost
their
muskets
many
were
frost
bitten
or
suffering
from
dysentery
the
surviving
nucleus
of
the
army
was
composed
almost
entirely
of
the
old
regulars
the
galician
militia
and
new
levies
had
not
been
able
to
resist
the
temptation
to
desert
when
they
found
themselves
among
their
native
mountains
the
marquis
hoped
that
when
the
spring
came
round
they
would
find
their
way
back
to
the
army
in
this
expectation
as
we
shall
see
he
was
not
deceived
for
nearly
a
fortnight
the
wrecks
of
the
army
were
undisturbed
and
la
romana
was
able
to
collect
enough
efficients
to
constitute
two
small
corps
of
observation
one
of
which
he
posted
in
the
valley
of
the
sil
to
watch
for
any
signs
of
a
movement
of
the
french
from
the
direction
of
ponferrada
while
the
other
in
the
valley
of
the
minho
kept
a
similar
look
out
in
the
direction
of
lugo
the
latter
force
was
unmolested
but
on
january
general
mendizabal
who
was
watching
the
southern
road
reported
the
approach
of
a
heavy
hostile
column
this
was
marchand
s
division
of
ney
s
corps
the
marshal
had
divided
his
force
at
ponferrada
he
himself
with
maurice
mathieu
s
division
had
kept
the
main
road
to
lugo
while
marchand
had
been
told
off
to
clear
the
lateral
valleys
and
seize
orense
la
romana
very
wisely
resolved
that
his
unhappy
army
was
unfit
to
resist
french
troops
on
january
he
evacuated
orense
and
fled
across
the
sierra
cabrera
to
monterey
on
the
portuguese
frontier
here
at
last
he
found
rest
for
marchand
did
not
follow
him
into
the
mountains
but
after
a
short
stay
in
orense
marched
to
santiago
where
he
was
directed
to
relieve
soult
s
garrison
the
marquis
was
completely
lost
to
sight
in
his
frontier
fastnesses
and
was
able
to
do
his
best
to
reorganize
his
battered
host
by
february
he
had
men
under
arms
nearly
all
old
soldiers
for
the
galician
levies
were
still
scattered
in
their
homes
his
dispatches
during
this
period
are
very
gloomy
reading
he
complains
bitterly
of
the
apathy
of
the
and
the
indiscipline
of
his
officers
what
could
be
expected
of
subalterns
he
asks
when
a
general
martinengo
of
the
division
had
absconded
without
asking
leave
or
even
reporting
his
departure
i
know
not
where
the
patriotism
of
which
every
one
boasted
is
now
to
be
found
since
on
the
smallest
reverse
or
misfortune
they
lose
their
heads
and
think
only
of
saving
themselves
sacrificing
their
country
and
compromising
their
much
harassed
for
want
of
food
la
romana
kept
moving
his
head
quarters
he
was
sometimes
at
verin
and
monterey
sometimes
at
chaves
just
inside
the
portuguese
frontier
more
frequently
at
oimbra
he
had
only
nine
guns
left
there
was
no
reserve
of
ammunition
and
the
soldiers
had
but
few
cartridges
remaining
in
their
boxes
the
strongest
battalion
left
in
the
army
had
only
bayonets
many
had
but
seventy
or
eighty
and
others
notably
the
galician
local
corps
had
completely
disappeared
he
besought
the
central
junta
to
obtain
from
the
british
money
muskets
clothing
and
above
all
ammunition
or
the
army
would
never
be
fit
to
take
the
field
a
similar
request
in
the
most
pressing
terms
was
sent
to
sir
john
cradock
at
lisbon
most
of
these
details
are
from
two
interesting
dispatches
of
la
romana
in
the
foreign
office
papers
at
the
record
office
they
are
dated
from
chaves
on
and
they
are
unpublished
and
seem
to
be
unknown
even
to
general
arteche
who
has
made
such
a
splendid
collection
of
the
materials
in
the
spanish
archives
which
bear
on
this
obscure
corner
of
the
war
there
was
an
english
officer
captain
brotherton
with
the
army
of
la
romana
but
his
reports
which
napier
had
evidently
seen
are
now
no
longer
to
be
found
no
doubt
they
were
bound
up
in
the
book
of
portuguese
dispatches
which
since
napier
s
day
has
disappeared
from
the
record
office
leaving
no
trace
behind
soult
could
not
but
be
aware
that
la
romana
s
army
or
some
shadow
of
it
was
still
in
existence
but
since
it
sedulously
avoided
any
contact
with
him
and
had
completely
evacuated
the
of
galicia
he
appears
to
have
treated
it
as
a
negligible
quantity
during
his
first
operations
its
dispersion
if
it
required
any
further
dispersing
would
fall
to
the
lot
of
ney
and
the
corps
not
to
that
of
the
army
sent
against
portugal
franceschi
and
lahoussaye
as
we
have
already
seen
reached
the
minho
and
the
portuguese
border
on
february
it
was
only
on
the
eighth
that
the
duke
of
dalmatia
set
out
from
santiago
to
follow
them
in
company
with
the
division
of
merle
those
of
delaborde
and
mermet
released
by
the
arrival
of
ney
took
the
same
route
on
the
ninth
and
tenth
respectively
the
rear
was
brought
up
by
the
reserve
and
heavy
artillery
and
by
that
brigade
of
lorges
dragoons
which
had
not
been
handed
over
to
the
corps
the
being
very
good
soult
was
able
to
concentrate
his
whole
army
within
the
triangle
tuy
salvatierra
vigo
by
the
thirteenth
in
spite
of
the
hindrances
caused
by
a
week
of
perpetual
storm
and
rain
it
was
the
marshal
s
intention
to
enter
portugal
by
the
great
which
crosses
the
minho
at
tuy
and
proceeds
to
oporto
by
way
of
valenza
and
braga
but
as
valenza
was
a
fortress
and
its
cannon
commanded
the
broad
ferry
at
which
the
usual
passage
was
made
it
was
clearly
necessary
to
choose
some
other
point
for
crossing
the
frontier
river
after
a
careful
survey
soult
fixed
on
a
village
named
campo
saucos
only
two
miles
from
the
mouth
of
the
minho
as
offering
the
best
he
established
a
battery
of
heavy
guns
on
his
own
side
of
the
river
and
collected
a
number
of
sufficient
to
carry
men
at
a
voyage
as
he
could
not
discover
that
the
portuguese
had
any
regular
force
opposite
him
he
resolved
to
attempt
the
passage
with
these
modest
resources
these
boats
were
brought
to
campo
saucos
overland
for
a
full
mile
and
more
they
came
from
la
guardia
and
other
on
the
coast
but
finding
it
impossible
to
get
them
over
the
bar
of
the
minho
in
such
furious
weather
and
against
the
swollen
stream
soult
dragged
them
from
the
beach
north
of
the
mouth
to
the
on
rollers
much
as
mohammed
ii
did
with
his
galleys
at
the
famous
siege
of
constantinople
in
but
soult
s
vessels
were
of
course
much
smaller
there
would
have
been
no
great
difficulty
in
the
enterprise
during
ordinary
weather
but
the
incessant
rains
had
so
swelled
the
minho
that
it
was
now
a
wild
ungovernable
torrent
which
it
was
hard
to
face
and
still
harder
to
stem
when
the
heavy
atlantic
surf
met
the
furious
current
of
the
stream
during
the
rising
of
the
tide
the
conflict
of
the
waters
made
the
passage
absolutely
impossible
it
had
to
be
attempted
at
the
moment
between
the
flow
and
the
ebb
though
there
was
at
that
hour
another
danger
that
the
boats
might
be
carried
past
the
appointed
and
wrecked
on
the
bar
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
but
this
chance
soult
resolved
to
risk
on
february
long
before
daybreak
his
twenty
or
thirty
each
with
a
dozen
men
on
board
launched
out
from
the
northern
shore
and
struck
diagonally
across
the
stream
as
the
current
bore
them
they
were
at
once
saluted
by
a
heavy
but
fire
from
the
portuguese
bank
where
hundreds
of
peasants
were
at
watch
even
during
the
hours
of
darkness
the
soldiers
rowed
and
steered
badly
soult
had
only
been
able
to
give
them
as
guides
a
mere
handful
of
men
trained
to
the
water
the
furious
current
swept
them
away
probably
also
their
nerve
was
much
tried
by
the
fusillade
which
though
more
noisy
than
dangerous
yet
occasionally
picked
off
a
rower
or
a
helmsman
the
general
result
was
that
only
three
boats
with
or
forty
men
got
to
the
appointed
where
they
were
made
prisoners
by
the
portuguese
the
rest
were
borne
and
came
ashore
at
various
points
on
the
same
side
from
which
they
had
started
barely
avoiding
shipwreck
on
the
bar
soult
had
got
together
a
few
dozen
seamen
french
prisoners
of
war
found
at
corunna
and
ferrol
who
had
been
captured
at
sea
by
spanish
cruisers
they
were
not
marines
as
napier
calls
them
ii
but
see
le
noble
and
again
the
attempt
to
pass
the
minho
therefore
ended
in
a
ridiculous
fiasco
it
showed
the
limitations
of
the
french
army
which
among
its
numerous
merits
did
not
possess
that
of
good
seamanship
soult
was
deeply
chagrined
not
because
of
the
insignificant
loss
of
men
but
because
of
the
check
to
his
prestige
he
resolved
that
he
would
not
risk
another
such
failure
and
at
once
gave
orders
for
the
whole
army
to
march
to
orense
the
first
point
where
there
was
a
bridge
over
the
minho
this
entailed
a
radical
change
in
his
general
plan
of
operations
for
he
was
abandoning
the
good
by
tuy
and
valenza
for
a
very
poor
from
orense
to
chaves
along
the
valley
of
the
tamega
there
was
another
important
result
from
the
alteration
the
new
route
brought
the
french
army
down
upon
la
romana
s
camp
of
refuge
his
cantonments
in
and
about
monterey
lay
right
across
its
path
but
neither
he
nor
soult
had
yet
realized
the
fact
that
they
were
about
once
more
to
come
into
collision
the
marshal
did
not
know
where
the
marquis
was
the
marquis
did
not
at
first
understand
the
meaning
of
the
marshal
s
sudden
swoop
inland
some
of
the
spanish
officers
indeed
were
sanguine
enough
to
imagine
that
the
french
after
their
failure
on
the
lower
minho
would
abandon
galicia
altogether

nine

victims
of
the
detestable
weather
of
the
first
fortnight
of
february
were
left
behind
at

under
the
guard
of
a
of
infantry
it
was
on
the
march
from
tuy
to
orense
that
soult
began
to
realize
the
full
difficulties
of
his
task
he
had
already
met
with
small
insurgent
bands
but
they
had
been
dispersed
with
ease
and
he
had
paid
little
attention
to
them
now
however
along
the
steep
and
tiresome
mountain
road
above
the
minho
they
appeared
in
great
force
and
showed
a
spirit
and
an
enterprise
which
were
wholly
unexpected
by
the
french
the
fact
was
that
in
the
month
which
had
now
elapsed
since
the
battle
of
corunna
the
peasantry
and
the
local
notables
had
found
time
to
take
stock
of
the
situation
the
first
numbing
effect
of
the
presence
of
a
large
hostile
army
in
their
midst
had
passed
away
ruthless
requisitions
were
sweeping
off
their
cattle
the
only
wealth
of
the
country
although
soult
had
issued
pacific
proclamations
and
had
tried
to
keep
his
men
in
hand
he
could
not
restrain
the
usual
plundering
propensities
of
a
french
army
on
the
march
enough
atrocities
had
already
been
committed
to
make
the
galicians
forget
the
misconduct
of
moore
s
men
la
romana
from
his
refuge
at
monterey
had
been
dispersing
appeals
to
the
patriotism
of
the
province
and
sending
out
officers
with
local
knowledge
to
rouse
the
these
probably
had
less
effect
on
the
galicians
the
marquis
was
a
stranger
and
a
defeated
general
than
the
exhortations
of
their
own
clergy
in
the
first
rising
of
the
peasantry
most
of
the
leaders
were
ecclesiastics
in
the
region
which
soult
was
now
traversing
the
peasantry
were
raised
by
mauricio
troncoso
abbot
of
couto
and
a
friar
named
giraldez
who
kept
the
insurgents
together
until
some
weeks
later
they
handed
over
the
command
to
military
officers
sent
by
la
romana
or
by
the
central
junta
in
the
valley
of
the
sil
beyond
orense
it
was
quiroga
abbot
of
casoyo
who
first
called
out
the
every
narrative
of
the
galician
insurrection
whether
french
or
spanish
bears
witness
to
the
fact
that
in
almost
every
case
the
clergy
regular
and
secular
were
the
earliest
chiefs
of
the
mountaineers
it
was
characteristic
of
the
whole
rising
that
many
of
the
bands
took
the
field
with
the
of
their
parishes
as
substitutes
for
the
national
flag
all
the
details
of
the
galician
insurrection
may
be
found
in
the
very
interesting
guerrilleros
gallegos
de
of
pardo
de
andrade
reprinted
at
corunna
in
it
is
absolutely
contemporary
and
mainly
composed
of
original
documents
written
by
men
who
shared
in
the
rising
but
naturally
it
contains
errors
and
exaggerations
this
much
is
certain
that
as
soon
as
the
violent
february
rains
showed
signs
of
slackening
the
whole
of
rural
galicia
flew
to
arms
from
corcubion
on
the
headland
of
finisterre
to
the
remote
headwaters
of
the
sil
under
the
sierra
de
penamarella
there
was
not
a
valley
which
failed
to
answer
the
appeal
which
la
romana
had
made
and
which
the
clergy
had
circulated
from
the
weak
and
sporadic
movements
of
january
there
sprang
in
february
a
general
insurrection
which
was
all
the
more
formidable
because
it
had
no
single
focus
was
based
on
no
place
of
arms
and
was
directed
not
by
one
chief
but
by
fifty
local
leaders
each
intimately
acquainted
with
the
district
in
which
he
was
about
to
operate
the
first
result
of
this
widespread
movement
was
to
complete
the
severance
of
the
communications
between
the
various
french
divisions
in
galicia
from
the
earliest
appearance
of
the
invaders
as
we
have
already
seen
there
had
been
intermittent
attempts
to
cut
the
lines
of
road
by
which
the
and
corps
kept
touch
with
each
other
and
with
madrid
but
hitherto
a
convoy
or
escort
of
a
couple
of
hundred
men
could
generally
brush
aside
its
assailants
and
get
through
from
post
to
post
in
february
this
power
of
movement
ceased
the
insurgents
became
not
only
more
numerous
and
more
daring
but
infinitely
more
skilful
in
their
tactics
instead
of
endeavouring
to
deliver
combats
in
the
open
they
broke
the
bridges
burnt
the
cut
away
the
road
in
rocky
places
and
then
hung
persistently
about
any
corps
that
was
on
the
move
as
soon
as
it
began
to
get
among
the
obstacles
they
fired
on
it
from
inaccessible
attacked
and
detained
its
rearguard
so
as
to
delay
its
march
thus
causing
a
gap
to
grow
between
it
and
the
main
body
and
only
closed
when
the
column
was
beginning
to
get
strung
out
into
a
series
of
isolated
groups
the
convoys
which
were
being
sent
up
from
astorga
to
the
and
corps
were
especially
vulnerable
to
such
tactics
the
shooting
of
a
few
horses
in
a
defile
would
hopelessly
block
the
progress
of
everything
that
was
coming
on
from
behind
the
massing
of
men
to
repair
or
rehorse
disabled
wagons
only
gave
the
lurking
insurgent
a
larger
and
an
easier
target
hence
the
bringing
up
to
the
front
of
the
heavy
transport
of
the
french
army
became
such
a
slow
and
costly
business
that
the
attempt
to
move
it
was
after
a
time
almost
abandoned
another
point
which
the
insurgents
soon
perceived
was
the
helplessness
of
the
french
cavalry
among
rocks
and
defiles
a
horseman
can
not
get
at
an
enemy
who
lurks
above
his
head
in
precipitous
crags
refuses
to
come
down
to
the
and
takes
careful
shots
from
his
eyrie
into
the
squadron
below
if
worried
beyond
endurance
the
french
officers
dismounted
some
of
their
men
to
charge
the
hillside
the
peasants
fled
away
and
were
out
of
sight
before
the
dragoons
in
their
heavy
boots
could
climb
the
first
fifty
yards
of
the
ascent
the
copious
annals
of
the
galician
guerrilla
bands
almost
invariably
begin
with
tales
of
the
annihilation
of
insufficiently
guarded
convoys
or
of
the
defeat
and
extermination
of
small
bodies
of
cavalry
caught
in
some
defile
a
very
little
experience
of
such
petty
successes
soon
taught
them
the
right
way
to
deal
with
the
french
the
invaders
could
not
be
beaten
but
might
be
cut
off
in
detail
harassed
into
exhaustion
and
so
isolated
one
from
the
other
that
it
would
require
the
sending
out
of
a
considerable
expedition
to
carry
a
message
between
two
neighbouring
garrisons
or
to
forward
a
dispatch
down
the
to
madrid
in
a
very
short
time
intercommunication
between
the
various
sections
of
the
french
army
in
galicia
became
so
rare
and
uncertain
that
each
commander
of
a
garrison
or
chief
of
a
column
found
himself
in
the
condition
of
a
man
lost
in
a
fog
his
friends
might
be
near
or
far
might
be
faring
ill
or
prosperously
but
it
was
almost
impossible
to
get
news
of
them
every
garrison
was
surrounded
with
a
loose
screen
of
insurgents
which
could
only
be
pierced
by
a
great
effort
each
column
on
the
march
moved
on
surrounded
by
a
swarm
of
active
enemies
who
closed
around
again
in
spite
of
all
attempts
to
brush
them
off
in
march
and
april
ney
on
whom
the
worst
stress
of
the
insurrection
fell
could
only
communicate
with
his
outlying
troops
by
taking
circular
tours
at
the
head
of
a
force
of
several
thousand
men
sometimes
he
found
instead
of
the
post
which
he
had
intended
to
visit
only
a
ruined
village
full
of
corpses
ere
the
galician
rising
was
three
months
old
the
bands
had
become
bold
and
skilful
enough
to
cut
off
a
strong
detachment
or
to
capture
a
place
held
by
a
garrison
several
hundreds
strong
in
june
they
actually
stopped
the
marshal
himself
with
a
whole
division
at
his
back
in
his
attempt
to
march
from
santiago
to
recapture
vigo
but
these
times
were
still
far
in
the
future
and
when
on
february
soult
started
on
his
march
along
the
minho
from
tuy
to
orense
the
peasantry
were
far
from
being
the
formidable
opponents
that
they
afterwards
became
nevertheless
the
progress
of
the
corps
was
toilsome
and
slow
in
the
extreme
the
troops
had
been
divided
between
two
paths
of
which
the
a
mile
or
two
from
the
river
was
only
a
trifle
less
impracticable
than
the
rougher
path
along
the
water
s
edge
lahoussaye
s
dragoons
had
been
put
upon
the
latter
track
heudelet
s
infantry
division
led
the
advance
on
the
upper
road
all
day
long
the
march
was
harassed
by
the
insurgents
who
descended
from
the
hills
and
hung
on
the
left
flank
of
heudelet
s
column
delivering
partial
attacks
whenever
they
thought
that
they
saw
an
opportunity
the
french
advanced
with
difficulty
much
incommoded
by
the
need
of
dragging
on
their
cannon
which
could
hardly
be
got
forward
even
with
the
aid
of
the
infantry
lahoussaye
on
the
other
path
was
assailed
in
a
similar
way
besides
being
molested
by
the
portuguese
who
moved
parallel
to
him
on
the
south
side
of
the
minho
taking
long
shots
at
his
dragoons
wherever
the
path
was
close
enough
to
the
water
s
edge
to
be
within
range
of
their
own
bank
if
the
peasantry
had
confined
themselves
to
these
tactics
they
might
have
harassed
soult
at
small
cost
to
themselves
but
they
had
not
yet
fully
learnt
the
guerrilla
s
trade
at
mourentan
on
the
path
by
the
river
and
at
francelos
on
the
they
had
resolved
to
offer
direct
resistance
to
the
enemy
and
so
put
themselves
within
reach
of
the
invader
s
claws
at
each
place
they
had
barricaded
the
village
had
run
a
rough
entrenchment
across
the
road
and
stood
to
receive
the
frontal
shock
of
the
french
attack
they
were
of
course
routed
with
great
slaughter
when
they
thus
exposed
themselves
in
close
combat
several
hundred
perished
among
whom
were
many
of
their
clerical
leaders
thus
soult
was
able
to
push
on
and
occupy
rivadavia
which
he
found
evacuated
by
its
inhabitants
his
soldiery
had
sacked
and
burnt
all
the
villages
on
the
way
and
according
to
the
spanish
narratives
shot
all
adult
males
whom
they
could
catch
whether
found
with
arms
or
not
long
details
of
all
this
fighting
may
he
found
in
the
narrative
of
the
alcalde
of
rivadavia
on
pp
of
vol
ii
of
guerrilleros
the
details
are
probably
exaggerated
but
the
reader
can
hardly
refuse
to
believe
that
there
is
a
solid
substratum
of
truth
the
alcalde
notes
that
the
infantry
were
far
better
behaved
than
lahoussaye
s
dragoons
of
whom
he
tells
tales
of
quite
incredible
ferocity
even
alleging
that
they
burnt
the
wounded
on
the
eighteenth
having
cut
his
way
as
far
as
rivadavia
the
duke
of
dalmatia
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
hopeless
to
endeavour
to
carry
on
with
him
his
heavy
artillery
and
his
baggage
on
such
roads
as
he
had
been
traversing
and
amid
the
continual
attacks
of
the
insurgents
they
would
be
of
more
harm
than
use
in
all
probability
they
would
ere
long
fall
so
far
behind
that
along
with
their
escort
they
would
become
separated
from
the
army
and
perhaps
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
spaniards
accordingly
he
sent
orders
to
the
rear
of
the
column
that
merle
s
division
should
conduct
back
to
tuy
all
the
heavy
baggage
and
guns
of
large
calibre
only
twenty
pieces
mostly
were
to
follow
the
expedition
when
the
wagons
had
been
turned
back
there
were
only
and
mules
sufficient
to
carry
rounds
for
the
guns
and
cartridges
for
the
infantry
this
was
a
dangerously
small
equipment
for
an
army
which
had
a
whole
kingdom
to
conquer
and
which
was
forced
to
waste
many
shots
every
day
on
keeping
off
the
irrepressible
insurgents
but
soult
was
determined
that
he
should
not
be
accused
of
shrinking
from
the
task
imposed
on
him
or
allowing
himself
to
be
thwarted
by
bands
of
peasants
the
heavy
guns
and
the
train
therefore
were
deposited
at
tuy
along
with
the
large
body
of
sick
and
wounded
who
had
already
been
left
there
general
lamartinière
an
officer
in
whom
soult
placed
much
confidence
was
left
in
command
he
was
warned
that
he
would
have
to
take
care
of
himself
as
his
communication
with
the
army
would
be
cut
the
moment
that
merle
s
troops
resumed
their
march
to
join
the
rear
of
the
advancing
column
nor
did
soult
err
in
this
when
the
corps
had
gone
on
its
way
tuy
and
the
neighbouring
post
of
vigo
were
immediately
beset
by
a
thick
swarm
of
peasants
who
kept
them
completely
blockaded
having
thus
freed
himself
from
every
possible
incumbrance
the
duke
of
dalmatia
pushed
briskly
on
for
orense
and
its
bridge
the
insurgents
had
not
fallen
back
very
far
and
on
the
nineteenth
heudelet
s
division
had
two
smart
engagements
with
them
and
drove
them
back
to
masside
in
the
hills
to
the
left
of
the
road
the
valley
was
here
wider
and
the
route
better
than
on
the
previous
day
and
much
more
satisfactory
progress
was
made
on
the
twentieth
still
pushing
on
soult
found
that
the
ferry
of
barbantes
ten
miles
below
orense
was
passable
the
galicians
had
scuttled
the
in
an
imperfect
fashion
some
voltigeurs
crossed
on
a
raft
repaired
the
boat
and
set
it
working
again
soult
then
pushed
across
the
river
some
of
mermet
s
battalions
intending
to
send
them
to
orense
by
the
south
bank
if
it
should
be
found
that
the
bridge
was
broken
meanwhile
heudelet
continued
to
advance
by
the
road
on
the
north
side
his
column
arrived
at
its
goal
and
found
orense
undefended
and
its
bridge
intact
the
townsfolk
made
no
attempt
to
resist
they
had
not
left
their
dwellings
like
the
peasants
and
their
magistrates
came
out
to
surrender
the
place
in
due
form
they
appealed
to
soult
s
clemency
by
showing
him
that
they
had
kept
safe
and
properly
cared
for
sick
french
soldiers
left
behind
by
marchand
when
he
had
marched
through
the
town
in
the
preceding
month
where
meanwhile
it
will
be
asked
was
the
army
of
la
romana
the
marquis
had
now
men
collected
at
oimbra
and
monterey
and
it
might
have
been
expected
that
he
would
have
moved
forward
to
defend
the
line
of
the
minho
and
the
bridge
of
orense
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
the
eastward
march
of
the
corps
he
made
no
such
advance
his
dispatches
show
that
the
sole
precautions
which
he
took
were
to
send
some
officers
with
fifty
men
to
aid
the
peasants
of
the
lower
minho
and
afterwards
to
order
another
party
only
strong
to
make
sure
that
the
between
tuy
and
orense
were
all
destroyed
or
removed
a
task
which
as
we
have
already
seen
they
did
not
fully
perform
if
he
had
brought
up
his
whole
force
instead
of
sending
out
these
paltry
detachments
he
would
have
made
the
task
of
soult
infinitely
more
bloody
and
dangerous
though
probably
he
could
not
have
prevented
the
marshal
from
carrying
out
his
plan
his
quiescence
is
not
to
be
explained
as
resulting
from
a
reluctance
to
fight
though
he
was
fully
conscious
of
the
low
of
his
army
and
was
at
his
wits
end
to
complete
its
dilapidated
equipment
it
came
from
another
cause
and
one
much
less
creditable
to
his
military
capacity
underrating
soult
s
force
which
he
placed
at
instead
of
men
he
was
labouring
under
the
idea
that
the
corps
was
about
to
retire
from
galicia
altogether
in
face
of
the
general
insurrection
and
the
want
of
food
the
march
of
the
french
to
orense
appeared
in
his
eyes
as
the
first
stage
of
a
retreat
up
the
valley
of
the
sil
to
ponferrada
and
astorga
and
he
imagined
that
the
province
would
soon
be
quit
of
them
hence
he
contented
himself
with
stirring
up
the
peasantry
and
left
to
them
the
task
of
harassing
soult
s
columns
being
resolved
to
make
the
proverbial
bridge
of
gold
for
a
flying
enemy
from
this
vain
dream
he
was
soon
to
be
awakened
from
the
to
the
of
february
the
duke
of
dalmatia
was
busily
employed
in
bringing
up
the
rear
divisions
of
his
army
to
orense
none
of
them
reached
that
place
without
fighting
for
the
bands
which
had
been
driven
off
by
heudelet
and
lahoussaye
returned
to
worry
the
troops
of
delaborde
merle
and
mermet
when
they
traversed
the
route
from
salvatierra
to
orense
jardon
s
brigade
of
the
division
had
a
sharp
fight
near
rivadavia
and
merle
had
to
clear
his
way
at
crecente
by
cutting
to
pieces
a
body
of
insurgents
which
had
fortified
itself
in
that
village
when
the
whole
army
was
concentrated
between
rivadavia
and
orense
the
marshal
sent
out
large
detachments
to
sweep
the
valleys
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
those
places
they
found
armed
peasantry
in
every
direction
but
in
each
case
succeeded
in
thrusting
them
back
into
their
hills
and
returned
to
orense
driving
before
them
large
herds
of
cattle
and
dragging
behind
them
country
wagons
with
a
considerable
amount
of
grain
the
longest
and
most
important
of
these
expeditions
was
one
made
by
franceschi
who
marched
with
his
own
horsemen
and
one
of
heudelet
s
brigades
along
the
road
which
the
whole
army
was
destined
to
take
in
its
invasion
of
portugal
they
routed
one
band
of
peasants
at
allariz
and
another
at
ginzo
half
way
to
monterey
february
still
there
was
no
sign
of
la
romana
s
army
which
remained
behind
the
mountains
of
the
sierra
cabrera
in
complete
quiescence
though
franceschi
s
advanced
posts
were
only
twenty
miles
away
le
noble
says
that
at
ginzo
the
peasants
had
with
them
general
mahy
and
la
romana
s
vanguard
division
but
general
arteche
gives
documentary
evidence
to
prove
that
on
that
day
mahy
and
his
troops
were
at
baltar
twenty
miles
away
behind
the
mountains
if
there
were
regulars
present
they
were
only
detachments
or
stragglers
soult
kept
his
head
quarters
at
orense
for
nine
days
during
which
he
was
busied
in
collecting
stores
of
food
repairing
his
artillery
whose
carriages
had
been
badly
shaken
by
the
villainous
roads
and
in
endeavouring
to
pacify
the
by
proclamations
and
circular
letters
to
the
notables
and
clergy
in
this
last
scheme
he
met
with
little
success
from
the
bishop
of
orense
downwards
almost
every
leading
man
had
taken
refuge
in
the
hills
and
refused
to
return
silence
or
defiant
replies
answered
the
marshal
s
epistolary
efforts
his
promises
of
protection
and
good
government
were
sincere
enough
but
the
commentary
on
them
was
given
by
the
excesses
and
atrocities
which
his
troops
were
committing
in
every
outlying
village
it
was
not
likely
that
the
galicians
would
come
down
from
their
fastnesses
to
surrender
for
the
bishop
of
orense
s
sarcastic
reply
see
arteche
for
the
general
effect
of
the
proclamation
see
chamans
of
the
atrocities
of
the
french
guerrilleros
give
ample
and
sometimes
incredible
accounts
the
general
advance
of
the
army
towards
portugal
had
been
fixed
for
march
it
was
not
made
under
the
most
cheerful
conditions
not
only
were
the
neighbouring
peasantry
still
defiant
as
ever
but
bad
news
had
come
from
the
north
an
of
marshal
ney
who
had
struggled
through
to
orense
in
despite
of
the
insurgents
brought
a
letter
from
his
chief
which
reported
that
the
rising
had
become
general
throughout
the
province
and
apparently
expressed
strong
doubts
as
to
the
wisdom
of
invading
portugal
before
galicia
was
subdued
the
duke
of
elchingen
as
it
would
seem
wished
his
colleague
to
draw
back
and
to
aid
him
in
suppressing
the
bands
of
the
coast
and
the
upper
minho
he
might
well
doubt
whether
the
corps
would
suffice
for
this
task
if
the
corps
marched
far
away
towards
oporto
and
got
completely
out
of
touch
soult
however
had
the
emperor
s
orders
to
advance
into
portugal
in
his
pocket
he
knew
that
if
he
disobeyed
them
no
excuse
would
propitiate
his
master
probably
he
was
not
sorry
to
leave
to
ney
the
unenviable
task
of
dealing
with
the
ubiquitous
and
irrepressible
galician
insurgents
he
sent
back
the
message
that
he
should
march
southward
on
march
and
continued
his
preparations
this
resolve
was
not
to
the
liking
of
some
of
his
subordinates
many
of
the
officers
who
had
served
with
junot
in
portugal
by
no
means
relished
the
idea
of
returning
to
that
country
they
did
not
conceal
their
feelings
and
made
the
most
gloomy
prophecies
about
the
fate
of
the
expedition
it
was
apparently
loison
who
formed
the
centre
of
this
clique
of
malcontents
he
found
many
sympathizers
among
his
subordinates
their
discontent
was
the
basis
upon
which
two
months
later
the
strange
and
obscure
oporto
conspiracy
of
captain
d
argenton
was
to
be
based
at
the
present
moment
however
they
contented
themselves
with
denunciations
of
the
madness
of
the
emperor
in
planning
the
expedition
and
of
the
blind
obedience
of
the
marshal
in
undertaking
it
they
told
their
comrades
that
the
numbers
courage
and
ferocity
of
the
galicians
were
as
nothing
compared
with
those
of
their
southern
neighbours
and
that
during
the
oncoming
operations
those
who
found
a
sudden
death
upon
the
would
be
lucky
for
the
portuguese
not
only
murdered
but
tortured
the
prisoners
the
wounded
and
the
stragglers
it
was
fortunate
for
soult
that
the
majority
of
his
officers
paid
comparatively
little
attention
to
these
forebodings
which
they
rightly
ascribed
to
the
feelings
of
resentment
and
humiliation
with
which
the
members
of
junot
s
army
remembered
the
story
of
their
former
disasters
but
it
did
not
make
matters
easier
for
the
marshal
that
even
a
small
section
of
his
lieutenants
disbelieved
in
the
feasibility
of
his
undertaking
and
expected
disaster
to
ensue
yet
the
opening
scenes
of
the
invasion
of
portugal
were
to
be
so
brilliant
and
fortunate
that
for
a
time
the
murmurs
of
the
prophets
of
evil
were
hushed
see
le
noble
for
this
dispatch
and
its
effect
on
the
of
the
army
for
the
malcontents
and
their
views
see
le
noble
pp
chamans
on
the
other
hand
says
that
the
army
started
in
good
spirits
and
with
a
great
contempt
for
all
insurgents
spanish
or
portuguese
as
a
trusted
staff
officer
of
the
marshal
he
no
doubt
represents
the
optimistic
view
at
head
quarters
on
march
the
marshal
s
head
quarters
were
moved
forward
from
orense
to
alariz
on
the
road
to
monterey
and
the
frontier
the
main
body
of
the
army
accompanied
him
but
franceschi
and
heudelet
were
already
far
in
front
at
ginzo
only
separated
from
la
romana
s
outposts
by
the
sierra
cabrera
from
that
point
there
are
two
difficult
but
practicable
roads
into
portugal
the
one
descends
the
valley
of
the
lima
and
leads
to
oporto
by
viana
and
the
coast
it
is
easier
than
the
second
or
inland
route
which
after
crossing
the
sierra
cabrera
descends
to
monterey
and
chaves
the
frontier
town
of
the
portuguese
province
of
but
every
military
reason
impelled
soult
to
choose
the
second
alternative
by
marching
on
viana
he
would
leave
la
romana
whose
presence
he
had
now
discovered
far
in
his
rear
the
marquis
would
be
a
bad
general
indeed
if
he
did
not
seize
the
opportunity
of
slipping
back
into
galicia
reoccupying
orense
and
setting
the
whole
aflame
it
was
infinitely
preferable
to
fall
upon
him
from
the
front
rout
him
and
fling
him
back
among
the
portuguese
accordingly
franceschi
leading
the
whole
army
crossed
the
mountains
on
the
fifth
and
came
hurtling
into
la
romana
s
cantonments
long
ere
he
was
expected
heudelet
was
just
behind
him
mermet
and
delaborde
a
march
further
back
merle
brought
up
the
rear
guarding
a
convoy
of
sick
and
wounded
whom
the
marshal
had
resolved
to
bring
on
with
him
rather
than
to
leave
them
at
orense
to
fall
a
prey
to
the
insurgents
the
dragoons
of
lorges
and
lahoussaye
were
kept
out
on
the
right
and
left
respectively
watching
the
one
the
valley
of
the
lima
the
other
the
head
waters
of
the
tamega
there
was
also
a
third
road
that
by
montalegre
and
ruivaens
by
which
soult
ultimately
evacuated
portugal
but
as
it
was
not
available
for
wheeled
traffic
it
could
not
be
used
by
an
army
with
artillery
down
to
the
last
moment
the
marquis
had
been
giving
out
his
intention
of
retiring
into
portugal
and
with
general
silveira
the
commandant
of
the
in
the
defence
of
chaves
and
the
line
of
the
tamega
but
he
was
on
very
strained
terms
with
his
ally
who
showed
no
great
alacrity
to
receive
the
spaniards
across
the
frontier
his
troops
had
been
quarrelling
with
the
portuguese
and
he
was
very
reluctant
to
expose
his
battalions
to
the
ordeal
of
a
battle
which
silveira
openly
courted
on
the
very
day
on
which
soult
started
from
orense
la
romana
made
up
his
mind
that
instead
of
joining
the
portuguese
he
would
escape
eastwards
by
the
single
road
over
and
above
that
of
chaves
which
was
open
to
him
accordingly
his
army
suddenly
started
off
abandoning
the
meagre
magazines
which
it
had
collected
at
oimbra
and
verin
and
made
for
puebla
de
senabria
on
the
borders
of
the
province
of
leon
by
the
road
which
coasts
along
the
north
side
of
the
portuguese
frontier
through
osoño
and
la
gudina
this
sudden
move
bore
the
appearance
of
a
mean
desertion
of
the
portuguese
in
their
day
of
peril
but
it
was
in
other
respects
wise
and
prudent
it
discomfited
all
soult
s
plans
since
he
failed
to
catch
the
army
of
galicia
which
escaped
him
and
placed
itself
on
his
flank
and
rear
instead
of
on
his
front
it
was
small
consolation
to
the
marshal
that
franceschi
came
on
the
rearguard
of
the
spaniards
at
la
trepa
near
osoño
and
routed
it
seven
skeleton

and
completely

the
rest
dispersed
but
la
romana
s
main
body
meanwhile
had
got
away
in
safety
and
soult
had
failed
to
strike
the
blow
which
he
intended
he
was
soon
to
hear
of
the
marquis
again
in
quarters
where
he
little
expected
and
still
less
desired
to
find
him

portugal
at
the
moment
of
soult
s
invasion
the
nation
the
regency
and
sir
john
cradock
soult
s
vanguard
crossed
the
portuguese
frontier
between
monterey
and
chaves
on
march
it
was
exactly
five
months
since
the
last
of
junot
s
troops
had
evacuated
the
realm
on
october
in
the
period
which
had
elapsed
between
those
two
dates
much
might
have
been
done
to
develop
or
rather
to
create
a
scheme
of
national
defence
and
a
competent
army
unhappily
for
portugal
the
regency
had
not
risen
to
the
opportunity
and
when
the
second
french
invasion
came
upon
them
the
military
organization
of
the
realm
was
still
in
a
state
of
chaos
during
the
autumn
months
of
the
portuguese
government
had
been
almost
as
sanguine
and
as
careless
as
the
spanish
supreme
junta
they
had
seen
junot
beaten
and
expelled
they
still
beheld
a
large
british
army
in
their
midst
and
they
did
not
comprehend
the
full
extent
of
the
impending
danger
when
the
news
came
that
bonaparte
was
nearing
the
pyrenees
and
that
the
columns
of
the
grand
army
were
debouching
into
the
peninsula
it
was
not
till
moore
had
departed
that
they
began
to
conceive
certain
doubts
as
to
the
situation
nor
was
it
till
madrid
had
fallen
that
they
at
last
realized
that
the
invader
was
once
more
at
their
gates
and
that
they
must
prepare
to
defend
themselves
there
were
still
two
months
of
respite
granted
to
them
portugal
like
andalusia
was
saved
for
a
moment
by
moore
s
march
to
sahagun
the
great
field
army
which
napoleon
had
collected
for
the
advance
on
lisbon
was
turned
off
northwards
to
pursue
the
british
and
on
the
new
year
s
day
of
the
only
french
force
in
proximity
to
the
frontier
of
the
realm
was
the
division
of
lapisse
which
bonaparte
had
dropped
at
salamanca
to
form
the
connecting
link
between
soult
and
ney
in
galicia
and
the
troops
under
victor
and
king
joseph
in
the
vicinity
of
madrid
but
the
danger
was
only
postponed
not
averted
by
moore
s
daring
irruption
into
old
castile
this
the
portuguese
regency
understood
and
during
the
first
two
months
of
they
displayed
a
considerable
amount
of
energy
though
it
was
in
great
part
energy
misdirected
their
chief
blunder
was
that
instead
of
straining
every
nerve
to
complete
their
regular
army
on
which
the
main
stress
of
the
invasion
was
bound
to
fall
they
diverted
much
of
their
zeal
to
the
task
of
raising
a
vast
en
of
the
whole
population
of
the
realm
this
error
had
its
roots
in
old
historical
memories
the
deliverance
of
portugal
from
the
spanish
yoke
in
the
long
war
of
independence
in
the
seventeenth
century
had
been
achieved
mainly
by
the
the
old
constitutional
force
of
the
realm
which
resembled
the
english
of
the
middle
ages
it
had
done
good
service
again
in
the
wars
of
and
even
in
the
shorter
struggle
of
but
in
the
nineteenth
century
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
reckon
upon
it
as
a
serious
line
of
defence
especially
when
the
enemy
to
be
held
back
was
not
the
disorderly
spanish
army
but
the
legions
of
bonaparte
when
there
were
not
even
arms
enough
in
portugal
to
supply
the
with
a
musket
for
every
man
it
was
insane
to
summon
together
huge
masses
of
peasantry
and
to
make
over
to
them
some
of
the
precious
firearms
which
should
have
been
reserved
for
the
regulars
the
majority
however
of
the
were
not
even
supplied
with
muskets
they
were
given
pikes
weapons
with
which
their
ancestors
had
done
good
service
in
but
which
it
was
useless
to
serve
out
in
the
regency
had
procured
some
from
the
british
government
and
had
caused
many
thousands
more
to
be
manufactured
both
on
the
northern
and
the
eastern
frontier
great
hordes
of
equipped
with
these
useless
and
antiquated
arms
were
gathered
together
destitute
of
discipline
and
of
officers
insufficiently
supplied
with
food
the
prey
of
every
rumour
true
or
false
that
ran
along
the
border
they
were
a
source
of
danger
rather
than
of
strength
to
the
realm
the
cry
of
treachery
which
inevitably
arises
among
armed
mobs
was
always
being
raised
in
their
encampments
hence
came
tumults
and
murders
for
the
peasantry
had
a
strong
suspicion
of
the
loyalty
of
the
governing
classes
the
result
of
the
subservience
to
the
french
invader
which
had
been
displayed
by
many
of
the
authorities
both
civil
and
military
in
orders
which
they
did
not
understand
or
into
which
a
sinister
meaning
could
be
read
by
a
suspicious
mind
generally
caused
a
riot
and
sometimes
the
assassination
of
the
unfortunate
commander
whom
the
regency
had
placed
over
the
horde
in
oporto
the
state
of
affairs
was
particularly
bad
the
bishop
though
a
sincere
patriot
and
a
man
of
energy
had
drunk
too
deeply
of
the
delights
of
power
during
his
rule
in
the
summer
months
after
being
made
a
member
of
the
regency
by
dalrymple
he
should
have
remained
at
lisbon
and
worked
with
his
colleagues
but
returning
to
his
own
flock
he
reassumed
the
authority
which
he
had
possessed
during
the
early
days
of
the
insurrection
and
pursued
a
policy
of
his
own
which
often
differed
from
that
of
his
regency
at
large
and
was
sometimes
in
flagrant
opposition
to
it
his
position
in
fact
was
similar
to
that
of
palafox
at
saragossa
and
like
the
aragonese
general
he
often
practised
the
arts
of
demagogy
in
order
to
keep
firm
his
influence
over
the
populace
he
was
all
for
the
system
of
the
en
and
summoned
together
unmanageable
bands
which
he
was
able
neither
to
equip
nor
to
control
he
praised
their
zeal
was
wilfully
blind
to
their
frequent
excesses
and
seldom
tried
to
turn
their
energies
into
profitable
channels
indeed
he
was
so
ignorant
of
military
matters
himself
that
he
had
no
useful
orders
to
give
he
ignored
the
advice
of
the
portuguese
generals
in
his
district
and
got
little
profit
from
that
of
two
foreign
officers
whom
the
british
government
sent
him
the
hanoverian
general
von
der
decken
and
the
prussian
baron
eben
these
gentlemen
he
seems
to
have
conciliated
and
to
have
played
off
against
the
native
military
authorities
but
if
they
gave
him
good
counsel
there
are
no
signs
in
his
actions
that
he
turned
it
to
account
all
the
british
witnesses
who
passed
through
oporto
in
january
and
february
describe
the
place
as
being
in
a
state
of
patriotic
frenzy
and
under
mob
law
rather
than
administered
by
any
regular
and
legal
government
the
only
fruitful
military
effort
made
in
this
part
of
portugal
was
that
of
the
gallant
sir
robert
wilson
who
raised
there
in
november
and
december
his
celebrated
loyal
lusitanian
this
was
intended
to
be
the
core
of
a
subsidiary
portuguese
division
in
british
pay
distinct
from
the
national
army
when
wilson
arrived
in
oporto
the
bishop
welcomed
him
and
forwarded
in
every
way
the
formation
of
the
corps
in
a
few
days
the
legion
had
recruits
of
excellent
quality
of
whom
wilson
could
arm
and
clothe
only
some
for
the
equipment
which
he
had
brought
with
him
was
limited
he
soon
discovered
however
that
the
bishop
s
zeal
in
his
behalf
was
mainly
due
to
the
desire
to
have
a
solid
force
at
hand
which
should
be
independent
of
the
portuguese
generals
he
wished
the
legion
to
be
as
it
were
his
own
sir
robert
was
ill
pleased
and
being
unwilling
to
mix
himself
in
the
domestic
feuds
of
the
bishop
and
the
regency
or
to
become
the
tool
of
a
faction
quitted
oporto
as
soon
as
his
men
could
march
with
one
strong
battalion
a
couple
of
squadrons
of
cavalry
and
an
incomplete
battery
under
men
in
all
he
moved
first
to
villa
real
and
then
to
the
frontier
where
he
posted
himself
near
almeida
and
took
over
the
task
of
observing
lapisse
s
division
which
from
its
base
at
salamanca
was
threatening
the
portuguese
border
of
his
splendid
services
in
this
direction
we
shall
have
much
to
tell
the
unequipped
portion
of
the
legion
left
behind
at
oporto
was
handed
over
to
baron
eben
and
became
involved
in
the
tumultuous
and
unhappy
career
of
the
bishop
list
of
arms
sent
to
portugal
on
of
for
the
portuguese
volume
for
december
and
in
the
record
office
being
mysteriously
lost
cradock
s
correspondence
and
that
of
the
other
british
officers
in
portugal
is
no
longer
available
but
napier
took
copious
notes
from
it
while
it
was
still
forthcoming
they
will
be
found
on
pp
of
his
vol
ii
and
bear
witness
to
a
complete
state
of
anarchy
in
oporto
the
first
battalion
used
to
call
the
second
baron
eben
s
runaways
when
they
met
again
as
mayne
assures
us
in
his
of
the
loyal
lusitanian
meanwhile
lisbon
was
almost
as
disturbed
as
oporto
and
might
have
lapsed
into
the
same
state
of
anarchy
if
a
british
garrison
had
not
been
on
the
spot
the
mistaken
policy
of
the
regency
had
led
to
the
formation
of
sixteen
legions
in
the
capital
and
suburbs
these
tumultuary
levies
had
few
officers
and
hardly
any
arms
but
pikes
they
were
under
no
sort
of
discipline
and
devoted
themselves
to
the
duty
of
hunting
for
spies
and
led
by
demagogues
of
the
streets
they
paraded
up
and
down
lisbon
to
beat
of
drum
arresting
persons
whom
they
considered
suspicious
especially
foreign
residents
of
all
nationalities
the
regency
having
issued
a
decree
prohibiting
this
practice
january
the
armed
levies
only
assembled
in
greater
numbers
next
night
and
engaged
in
a
general
chase
after
unpopular
citizens
policemen
and
aliens
of
all
kinds
many
fugitives
were
only
saved
from
death
by
taking
refuge
in
the
and
the
barracks
where
the
garrison
was
quartered
isolated
british
soldiers
were
assaulted
some
were
wounded
and
parties
of
legionaries
actually
stopped
and
orderlies
carrying
dispatches
and
stripped
them
of
the
documents
they
were
bearing
the
mob
was
inclined
indeed
to
be
towards
their
allies
from
the
suspicion
that
they
were
intending
to
evacuate
lisbon
and
to
retire
from
the
peninsula
they
had
seen
the
baggage
and
left
behind
by
moore
put
on
early
in
february
they
beheld
the
troops
told
off
for
the
occupation
of
cadiz
embark
and
disappear
when
they
also
noticed
that
the
forts
at
the
tagus
mouth
were
being
dismantled
they
made
up
their
minds
that
the
british
were
about
to
desert
them
without
making
any
attempt
to
defend
portugal
hence
came
the
malevolent
spirit
which
they
displayed
it
died
down
when
their
suspicions
were
proved
unfounded
by
the
arrival
of
beresford
and
other
british
officers
at
the
beginning
of
march
with
resources
for
the
reorganization
of
the
portuguese
army
and
still
more
when
a
little
later
heavy
reinforcements
from
england
began
to
pour
into
the
city
but
in
the
last
days
of
january
and
the
first
of
february
matters
at
lisbon
had
been
in
a
most
dangerous
and
critical
condition
the
regency
utterly
unable
to
keep
order
had
hinted
to
sir
john
cradock
that
he
must
take
his
own
measures
against
the
mob
and
for
several
days
the
british
general
had
kept
the
garrison
under
arms
and
planted
artillery
in
the
squares
and
broader
streets
exactly
as
junot
had
done
seven
months
before
the
legions
were
cowed
and
most
fortunately
no
collision
occurred
if
a
single
shot
had
been
fired
in
anger
there
would
have
been
an
end
of
the
alliance
and
it
is
more
than
likely
that
cradock
a
man
of
desponding
temperament
would
have
abandoned
the
country
they
were
raised
by
a
decree
of
this
was
a
proper
precaution
as
the
could
be
of
no
use
for
defending
lisbon
from
a
land
attack
while
if
lisbon
got
into
french
hands
again
they
would
have
been
invaluable
for
resisting
an
attack
from
the
side
of
the
sea
but
cradock
was
far
too
precipitate
in
commencing
an
operation
which
betrayed
such
want
of
confidence
his
force
at
this
moment
was
by
no
means
large
when
moore
marched
for
salamanca
in
october
he
had
left
behind
in
portugal
six
battalions
of
british
and
four
of
german
infantry
three
squadrons
of
the
light
dragoons
the
regiment
that
had
been
so
much
cut
up
at
vimiero
one
of
the
light
dragoons
of
the
king
s
german
legion
and
five
batteries
only
one
of
which
was
horsed
from
salamanca
when
on
the
eve
of
starting
on
the
march
to
sahagun
sir
john
had
sent
back
two
regiments
to
portugal
in
charge
of
his
great
convoys
of
sick
and
heavy
baggage
to
compensate
for
this
deduction
from
his
army
he
had
called
up
a
brigade
of
the
troops
left
in
portugal
but
only
one
battalion
of
it
the
reached
him
in
time
to
join
in
his
castilian
campaign
the
net
result
was
that
seven
british
infantry
regiments
from
moore
s
army
were
left
behind
in
addition
to
the
four
german
corps
two
more
had
arrived
from
england
in
november
and
a
fresh
regiment
of
dragoons
in
december
these
were
the
and
and
line
battalions
of
the
king
s
german
legion
the
and
the
last
battalion
was
mainly
composed
of
foreigners
and
had
received
more
than
recruits
from
the
deserters
of
junot
s
army
moore
would
not
trust
it
and
sent
it
back
it
afterwards
did
splendid
service
under
wellesley
the
battalions
that
did
not
get
up
in
time
were
the
and
these
were
the
and
which
had
sailed
with
baird
from
portsmouth
but
were
sent
on
from
corunna
to
lisbon
when
the
rest
of
baird
s
expedition
landed
in
galicia
the
light
dragoons
thus
when
sir
john
cradock
took
over
the
command
at
lisbon
on
december
he
had
at
his
disposal
in
all
thirteen
battalions
of
infantry
seven
squadrons
of
cavalry
and
five
batteries
a
force
of
about
men
but
not
more
than
were
effective
for
sir
john
moore
had
left
behind
precisely
those
of
his
regiments
which
were
most
sickly
when
he
marched
for
spain
he
had
moreover
discharged
more
than
additional
sick
upon
portugal
ere
he
began
field
operations
they
were
encumbering
the
hospitals
of
almeida
and
lamego
when
cradock
appeared
the
men
fit
for
service
were
scattered
all
over
portugal
the
two
battalions
which
had
just
come
back
from
spain
and
the
two
others
which
had
been
too
late
to
join
moore
were
in
the
north
at
almeida
and
lamego
one
battalion
was
in
garrison
at
elvas
six
lay
in
lisbon
as
also
did
the
whole
of
the
cavalry
and
guns
two
were
on
the
march
from
abrantes
to
almeida
napier
ii
much
when
he
calls
the
whole
including
cradock
s
regiments
add
up
to
about
men
including
those
in
hospital
in
addition
there
were
all
moore
s
sick
who
though
many
had
died
in
the
interim
presented
on
in
portugal
convalescents
to
the
number
of
men
the
and
the
the
four
german
battalions
the
and
the
and
such
a
dispersion
of
forces
would
have
appalled
the
most
enterprising
of
generals
and
this
was
a
title
to
which
cradock
had
certainly
no
claims
the
two
obvious
courses
between
which
he
had
to
choose
were
either
to
concentrate
his
little
army
on
the
frontier
and
make
as
much
display
of
it
in
the
face
of
the
french
as
might
be
possible
or
to
abandon
all
idea
of
protecting
exterior
portugal
and
collect
the
scattered
regiments
in
or
about
lisbon
cradock
chose
the
second
alternative
he
argued
that
he
was
too
weak
to
be
of
any
effectual
service
on
the
frontier
and
moreover
found
that
there
would
be
a
vast
difficulty
in
moving
forward
even
the
lisbon
garrison
for
nearly
all
the
available
transport
had
been
requisitioned
for
the
use
of
moore
s
army
and
had
been
carried
off
into
spain
neither
of
these
pleas
is
convincing
with
regard
to
the
first
it
is
merely
necessary
to
point
out
that
sir
robert
wilson
with
men
of
the
lusitanian
legion
not
yet
three
months
old
made
his
presence
felt
on
the
frontier
checked
lapisse
and
kept
the
whole
province
of
salamanca
in
a
state
of
unrest
ten
thousand
british
bayonets
and
sabres
could
have
done
much
more
as
to
the
food
and
supplies
cradock
was
arguing
in
the
old
style
as
if
a
british
army
was
bound
to
move
with
all
its
baggage
and
impedimenta
its
women
and
children
if
he
had
chosen
to
march
light
and
to
take
the
route
through
the
fertile
and
estremadura
he
could
have
reached
abrantes
or
almeida
or
any
other
goal
that
he
chose
the
fact
was
that
the
reasons
for
refusing
to
adopt
a
forward
policy
were
moral
and
not
physical
cradock
in
common
with
sir
john
moore
and
many
other
british
officers
believed
that
portugal
could
not
be
defended
and
was
thinking
more
of
securing
himself
a
safe
embarkation
than
of
exercising
any
influence
on
the
main
current
of
the
war
when
moore
s
army
had
passed
out
of
sight
and
was
known
to
be
retiring
in
the
direction
of
galicia
it
seemed
to
cradock
that
his
own
position
was
hopeless
even
if
granted
time
to
concentrate
his
scattered
battalions
he
would
be
forced
to
fly
to
the
sea
and
take
shipping
the
moment
that
any
serious
french
force
crossed
the
frontier
he
had
not
sufficiently
accurate
information
to
enable
him
to
see
that
both
lapisse
at
salamanca
and
the
weak
divisions
of
the
corps
which
lay
in
the
valley
of
the
tagus
could
not
possibly
move
forward
against
him
it
would
have
been
insane
for
either
of
these
forces
to
have
attacked
portugal
the
one
was
at
this
moment
less
than
the
other
about
strong
they
were
without
communications
and
separated
by
miles
of
pathless
sierras
moreover
the
troops
in
the
valley
of
the
tagus
were
fully
occupied
in
observing
the
spanish
army
of
estremadura
at
the
opening
of
the
new
year
therefore
cradock
was
in
absolutely
no
danger
and
might
have
gone
forward
either
to
abrantes
or
to
almeida
in
perfect
security
in
the
first
position
he
would
have
menaced
the
flank
of
the
corps
in
the
second
he
would
have
exercised
a
useful
pressure
on
lapisse
in
either
case
he
would
have
encouraged
the
portuguese
and
lent
moral
support
to
the
spaniards
but
cradock
was
possessed
by
that
miserable
theory
which
was
so
frequently
expounded
by
the
men
of
desponding
mind
during
the
early
years
of
the
peninsular
war
to
the
effect
that
portugal
was
indefensible
and
would
have
to
be
evacuated
whenever
a
strong
french
force
approached
its
frontier
it
was
fortunate
for
england
and
for
europe
that
wellesley
had
other
views
the
history
of
the
next
three
years
was
to
show
that
a
british
general
could
find
something
better
to
do
than
to
pack
up
his
baggage
and
prepare
to
embark
whenever
the
enemy
came
down
in
superior
strength
to
the
portuguese
border
sir
john
moore
himself
ventilated
this
view
in
a
letter
to
lord
castlereagh
from
salamanca
it
is
this
fact
that
explains
napier
s
very
tender
treatment
of
cradock
who
quoted
moore
as
his
justifying
authority
moreover
cradock
had
been
very
obliging
in
placing
all
his
papers
at
napier
s
disposal
a
fact
which
prepossessed
the
historian
in
his
favour
no
doubt
cradock
would
have
had
to
take
to
his
transports
if
the
french
had
possessed
on
january
an
army
of
men
available
for
the
invasion
of
portugal
and
ready
to
advance
they
did
not
happen
to
own
any
such
force
and
till
he
was
certain
that
such
a
force
existed
cradock
was
gravely
to
blame
for
ordering
every
british
soldier
to
fall
back
on
lisbon
and
for
openly
commencing
to
destroy
the
of
the
capital
it
is
true
that
the
dispatches
which
he
received
from
home
gave
him
many
directions
as
to
what
he
was
to
do
if
the
enemy
appeared
in
overpowering
strength
he
was
to
blow
up
the
shore
batteries
destroy
all
military
and
naval
stores
and
embark
with
the
british
troops
and
as
many
portuguese
as
could
be
induced
to
follow
but
this
was
only
to
take
place
upon
the
actual
approach
of
the
enemy
towards
lisbon
in
such
strength
as
may
render
all
further
resistance
ineffectual
to
commence
these
preparations
when
the
nearest
troops
of
the
enemy
were
at
salamanca
and
almaraz
was
premature
and
precipitate
in
the
highest
degree
till
the
french
began
to
move
every
endeavour
should
have
been
made
to
encourage
the
portuguese
and
to
maintain
a
show
even
if
it
were
but
a
vain
show
of
an
intention
to
defend
the
frontier
if
lapisse
had
heard
that
cradock
was
at
almeida
he
would
have
been
nailed
down
to
salamanca
if
victor
had
heard
that
he
was
at
alcantara
or
even
at
abrantes
he
would
never
have
dared
to
pursue
cuesta
into
southern
estremadura
castlereagh
to
cradock
napier
makes
on
this
the
curious
remark
that
the
ministry
gave
contradictory
orders
when
they
told
cradock
to
make
a
show
of
preparation
for
resistance
yet
to
get
ready
for
embarkation
if
it
should
prove
necessary
cradock
however
drew
into
lisbon
every
available
man
brigadier
cameron
with
the
troops
from
almeida
and
oporto
started
back
on
a
weary
march
from
the
north
via
coimbra
bringing
not
only
his
own
four
battalions
but
convalescents
and
returned
stragglers
from
moore
s
army
richard
stewart
with
the
two
battalions
that
had
been
at
abrantes
also
came
in
to
the
capital
and
all
the
british
troops
were
concentrated
by
the
beginning
of
february
save
the
regiment
which
still
lay
at
elvas
having
thus
got
together
about
men
cradock
with
almost
incredible
timidity
began
to
draw
them
back
to
passo
d
arcos
a
place
behind
lisbon
near
the
mouth
of
the
tagus
from
which
embarkation
was
easy
when
villiers
the
british
minister
at
lisbon
remonstrated
with
him
on
the
deplorable
political
consequences
of
assuming
this
ignoble
position
on
the
water
s
edge
cradock
replied
i
must
object
to
take
up
a
false
position
say
alcantara
or
to
occupy
the
heights
in
front
of
lisbon
which
would
only
defend
a
certain
position
and
leave
the
remainder
of
portugal
to
the
power
of
the
enemy
one
which
we
must
leave
upon
his
approach
and
seek
another
bearing
the
appearance
of
flight
and
yet
not
securing
our
retreat
the
whole
having
announced
the
intention
of
defending
lisbon
but
giving
up
that
idea
upon
the
approach
of
the
enemy
for
positions
liable
to
be
turned
on
every
side
can
not
be
persevered
in
by
an
inferior
on
the
day
february
upon
which
cradock
wrote
this
extraordinary
piece
of
english
prose
composition
whose
grammar
is
as
astounding
as
its
argument
the
nearest
french
troops
were
at
tuy
in
galicia
salamanca
in
leon
and
the
bridge
of
arzobispo
on
the
central
tagus
points
respectively
and
miles
distant
from
lisbon
as
the
crow
flies
and
infinitely
more
by
road
further
comment
is
hardly
necessary
at
this
moment
cradock
might
have
had
at
his
disposal
more
british
troops
but
he
had
chosen
to
fall
in
with
sir
george
smith
s
hasty
and
unauthorized
scheme
for
the
occupation
of
cadiz
and
had
sent
off
to
that
port
a
whole
brigade
under
general
mackenzie
he
also
dispatched
orders
to
colonel
kemmis
of
the
to
hand
over
elvas
to
the
portuguese
and
march
to
seville
the
battalion
moved
into
andalusia
and
placed
itself
at
the
disposition
of
frere
who
found
it
as
useless
as
the
force
which
smith
had
drawn
off
to
cadiz
it
was
several
months
before
the
rejoined
the
army
of
portugal
see
the
and
some
small
details
of
artillery
influenced
by
the
remonstrances
of
villiers
and
somewhat
comforted
by
the
fact
that
the
french
armies
had
nowhere
crossed
the
portuguese
frontier
cradock
was
at
last
persuaded
to
give
up
his
position
at
passo
d
arcos
he
fixed
his
head
quarters
at
lumiar
left
men
in
garrison
at
lisbon
and
cantoned
the
remainder
of
his
army
at
saccavem
and
other
places
a
few
miles
in
front
of
the
city
this
was
better
than
leaving
them
on
the
but
the
move
was
no
more
than
a
miserable
half
measure
it
was
almost
as
indicative
of
an
intention
to
depart
without
fighting
as
the
retreat
to
passo
d
arcos
had
been
in
short
from
january
to
the
end
of
april
the
british
army
exercised
no
influence
whatever
on
the
military
affairs
of
the
peninsula
yet
by
march
it
was
beginning
to
grow
formidable
in
numbers
early
in
that
month
all
the
troops
which
had
been
drawn
off
to
cadiz
were
sent
to
lisbon
and
by
the
addition
of
seven
good
battalions
to
his
corps
cradock
found
himself
at
the
head
of
over
men
there
were
but
effective
cavalry
and
of
the
six
batteries
only
two
incredible
as
it
may
seem
were
properly
horsed
though
three
months
had
passed
by
since
the
general
had
begun
his
first
complaints
on
this
point
but
british
troops
were
a
force
not
to
be
despised
and
if
wellesley
or
some
other
competent
officer
had
been
in
command
we
can
not
doubt
that
they
would
have
been
turned
to
some
profitable
use
under
cradock
they
remained
cantoned
in
the
suburbs
of
lisbon
for
the
whole
time
during
which
soult
was
completing
his
conquest
of
oporto
and
northern
portugal
and
victor
executing
his
invasion
of
estremadura
it
was
not
till
soult
s
advanced
guard
was
on
the
vouga
april
that
hill
and
beresford
succeeded
in
inducing
the
general
to
carry
forward
his
head
quarters
to
leiria
and
his
outposts
to
thomar
fortunately
his
tenure
of
command
was
at
last
drawing
to
an
end
on
april
sir
arthur
wellesley
arrived
in
lisbon
and
took
over
charge
of
the
troops
in
portugal
how
startling
were
the
consequences
of
this
change
of
generals
we
shall
soon
see
ere
may
was
out
the
whole
peninsula
realized
once
more
that
there
was
a
british
army
within
its
limits
a
fact
that
might
well
have
passed
unnoticed
during
the
last
four
months
not
only
mackenzie
s
brigade
but
also
tilson
s
brigade
the
and
and
the
stronger
battalions
of
campbell
which
had
gone
to
cadiz
directly
from
england
the
first
battalions
of
the
coldstream
and
scots
fusilier
guards
in
a
letter
of
march
to
villiers
cradock
makes
the
astounding
statement
that
after
scouring
all
portugal
for
horses
for
three
months
he
was
still
unable
to
provide
them
for
four
out
of
his
six
batteries
cradock

controversial
letters
to
lord
londonderry
printed
in
the
latter
s
history
ii
do
no
more
than
bear
out
londonderry
s
accusations
of
torpidity
against
sir
john
cradock
contended
that
before
the
arrival
of
hill
and
sherbrooke
and
the
return
of
mackenzie
from
cadiz
he
had
only
men
and
deducting
sick
and
garrisons
for
the
lisbon
forts
could
only
have
marched
out
with
letter
to
londonderry
on
vol
ii
of
the
latter
s
work
he
had
sent
men
to
cadiz
and
seville
on
sir
george
smith
s
unhappy
inspiration
or
his
force
would
have
been
much
larger
as
to
the
resolution
to
march
against
soult
which
he
afterwards
claimed
to
have
made
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
wellesley
on
his
arrival
wrote
to
castlereagh
that
sir
john
cradock
does
not
appear
to
have
entertained
any
decided
intention
of
moving
forward
on
the
contrary
he
appears
by
his
letters
to
villiers
to
have
intended
to
go
no
further
till
he
should
hear
of

section

chapter
iii
the
portuguese
army
its
history
and
its
reorganization
while
the
regency
was
wasting
much
of
its
energy
on
the
arming
of
the
undisciplined
masses
of
the
and
while
cradock
sat
supine
at
passo
d
arcos
and
at
saccavem
one
useful
piece
of
work
at
least
was
being
taken
in
hand
this
was
the
reorganization
of
the
portuguese
regular
army
a
task
which
the
regency
determined
though
only
so
late
as
february
to
hand
over
to
a
british
general
officer
to
explain
the
chaotic
condition
of
the
force
at
the
moment
when
soult
was
just
about
to
enter
portugal
a
short
account
of
its
previous
history
is
necessary
it
had
received
its
existing
shape
from
a
foreign
hand
that
of
the
conde
de
la
lippe
the
german
marshal
frederick
count
of
who
had
been
entrusted
with
its
command
during
the
short
war
with
spain
in
he
it
was
who
first
gave
portugal
an
army
of
the
modern
type
modelled
on
the
ordinary
system
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
showing
many
traces
of
adaptations
from
a
prussian
original
the
marshal
was
a
great
organizer
and
a
man
of
mark
his
name
is
perhaps
best
remembered
in
connexion
with
the
citadel
of
elvas
which
he
rebuilt
and
christened
la
lippe
after
himself
under
that
designation
we
shall
repeatedly
have
to
mention
it
while
describing
the
early
years
of
the
peninsular
war
as
he
left
it
the
portuguese
army
consisted
of
regiments
of
the
line
each
forming
a
single
battalion
of
seven
companies
and
men
there
were
twelve
regiments
of
cavalry
each
originally
composed
of
no
more
than
sabres
and
three
regiments
of
artillery
of
eight
batteries
each
besides
a
few
garrison
companies
of
that
arm
after
la
lippe
s
departure
the
army
had
shared
in
the
general
decay
of
strength
and
organization
in
the
kingdom
which
prevailed
during
the
reign
of
the
mad
queen
maria
and
her
son
the
feeble
john
but
the
lack
of
mere
numerical
strength
was
not
nearly
so
fatal
to
its
efficiency
as
the
rustiness
and
rottenness
of
its
internal
machinery
under
an
octogenarian
the
duke
of
alafoens
every
department
of
the
army
had
been
decaying
in
the
latter
years
of
the
eighteenth
century
all
the
typical
faults
of
an
army
of
the
after
a
long
period
of
peace
were
developed
to
the
highest
possible
pitch
commissions
were
sold
or
given
away
by
intrigue
and
corruption
often
to
persons
of
unsuitable
rank
and
education
promotion
was
slow
and
perfectly
arbitrary
the
pay
of
the
officers
was
very
low
while
every
incentive
to
petty
jobbing
and
embezzlement
was
afforded
by
the
vicious
system
under
which
the
colonel
contracted
with
the
government
for
his
regiment
and
the
captain
with
the
colonel
for
his
company
in
the
portuguese
army
as
in
all
others
where
this
antiquated
practice
prevailed
the
temptation
to
fill
the
with
and
absentees
so
that
the
contractor
might
save
their
food
and
pocket
their
pay
had
been
too
strong
for
the
ordinary
officer
to
resist
hence
came
the
empty
ranks
of
the
battalions
the
ludicrous
disproportion
of
horses
to
men
in
the
cavalry
the
depleted
condition
of
the
regimental
stores
and
equipment
all
authorities
agree
as
to
the
inferior
character
and
status
of
a
great
part
of
the
portuguese
officers
dumouriez
remarks
that
their
pay
does
not
enable
them
to
live
better
than
the
common
soldiers
whose
comrades
and
relatives
they
often
are
the
subaltern
ranks
are
filled
from
the
inferior
classes
and
their
hatred
of
foreigners
prevents
their
association
with
or
receiving
any
improvement
from
them
hence
it
is
that
they
remain
in
such
ignorance
and
wretchedness
halliday
remarks
that
even
captains
had
not
the
rank
of
compare
with
this
patterson
s
curious
note
vol
the
familiarity
that
subsists
between
the
native
officers
and
their
men
renders
ineffective
all
the
authority
of
the
former
at
the
same
time
defeating
the
object
to
be
attained
by
discipline
they
eat
gamble
and
drink
together
i
have
even
seen
them
waltzing
and
figuring
off
in
the
captains
with
corporals
majors
with
drumboys
all
well
met
and
excellent
boon
companions
they
will
not
of
themselves
do
anything
their
good
qualities
must
be
elicited
by
strangers
i
know
of
nothing
that
stamps
the
character
of
lord
beresford
as
a
man
of
energy
and
perseverance
more
than
the
way
in
which
he
has
organized
them

from
a
miserable
undisciplined
rabble
produced
in
course
of
time
a
fair

their
english
officers

the
complete
disorganization
of
the
army
hasty
measures
were
taken
to
strengthen
it
in
the
moment
of
panic
every
infantry
regiment
was
ordered
to
raise
a
second
battalion
and
though
the
number
of
companies
per
battalion
was
lowered
from
seven
to
five
yet
as
each
of
them
was
now
to
consist
of
instead
of
men
the
total
strength
of
each
infantry
corps
was
raised
to
officers
and
men
at
the
same
time
the
cavalry
regiments
were
supposed
to
have
been
increased
to
sabres
and
a
fourth
regiment
of
artillery
was
created
nor
was
this
all
an
experimental
legion
for
light
infantry
service
eight
companies
strong
with
a
couple
of
squadrons
and
a
battery
attached
to
it
was
soon
afterwards
raised
by
the
marquis
d
alorna
of
these
twelve
squadrons
were
originally
cuirassiers
dumouriez
but
their
armament
had
been
discarded
before
and
one
regiment
only
was
light
horse
but
after
the
peace
of
badajoz
had
been
signed
the
army
was
allowed
to
sink
back
into
its
old
sloth
and
inefficiency
when
junot
entered
portugal
in
december
it
is
doubtful
if
there
were
as
many
as
troops
really
embodied
though
the
nominal
total
of
the
national
army
reached
nearly
men
regiments
of
infantry

two
battalions

regiments

four

total
halliday
gives
an
even
larger
figure
portugal
had
a
few
keen
soldiers
such
as
gomez
freire
de
andrade
and
the
renegade
d
alorna
who
had
received
abroad
a
good
military
education
and
had
even
written
military
books
but
the
majority
of
the
officers
were
slack
ignorant
and
incompetent
while
the
men
were
badly
disciplined
and
the
only
attempt
which
had
been
made
to
introduce
any
of
the
modern
military
discoveries
which
had
been
worked
out

the
wars
of
the
french

in

creation

experimental
legion
which
d
alorna
had
been
allowed
to
raise
and
to
train
with
a
new
drill
adapted
by
himself
from
french
models
the
main
body
of
the
army
looked
with
some
jealousy
and
suspicion
on
this
corps
and
had
made
no

copy

the
french

dashed

the

junot
it
will
be
remembered
had
disbanded
the
greater
part
of
the
men
and
formed
with
the
remainder
a
few
battalions
which
he
had
begun
to
send
off
to
france
ere
the
insurrection
of
june

of
them
took
an
involuntary
share
in
the
first
siege
of
saragossa
others
were
hurled
into
the
red
holocaust
of
wagram
when
portugal
rose
against
the
invader
the
local
juntas
endeavoured
to
call
back
to
arms
all
the
dispersed
officers
and
men
to
serve
as
a
nucleus
for
the
insurrectionary
hosts
the
system
of
recruiting
which
la
lippe
had
introduced
made
this
comparatively
easy
he
had
instituted
regimental
districts
in
a
very
complete
form
each
corps
was
named
after
a
particular
town
or
region
drew
its
conscripts
from
that
locality
and
was
usually
quartered
in
it
when
junot
disbanded
the
old
army
the
men
naturally
returned
to
their
homes
it
resulted
that
when
for
example
the
oporto
junta
summoned
out
to
service
the
late
members
of
the
and
regiments
of
the
line
the
two
units
belonging
to
the
oporto
district
it
could
be
certain
of
finding
the
greater
part
of
the
rank
and
file
without
much
difficulty
to
reconstitute
in
a
hurry
the
corps
of
officers
was
a
much
harder
matter
a
disproportionate
number
of
the
more
competent
holders
of
commissions
had
been
drafted
into
the
contingent
sent
to
france
comparatively
few
resided
in
their
proper
regimental
districts
many
in
lisbon
which
was
still
in
junot
s
hands
hence
the
battalions
which
fought
under
leite
at
evora
or
accompanied
wellesley
to
vimiero
bore
their
old
names
indeed
but
were
not
merely
and
low
in
numbers
but
lacked
a
due
supply
of
officers
considering
the
inefficiency
of
the
regiments
even
before
they
were
destroyed
by
junot
they
might
now
be
described
as
no
more
than
the
shadow
of
a
except
two
lisbon
regiments
named
viera
tellez
and
freire
from
former
colonels
of
distinction
nos
and
when
the
french
had
been
driven
out
of
portugal
and
the
junta
of
regency
took
in
hand
the
reconstruction
and
enlargement
of
the
army
the
problem
of
organization
seemed
almost
insoluble
the
government
decreed
that
the
regiments
of
infantry
of
the
line
should
be
raised
to
their
full
establishment
of
a
figure
which
they
had
never
really
attained
in
the
old
days
it
was
also
decided
to
create
six
new
battalions
of
riflemen
cazadores
a
class
of
infantry
of
which
d
alorna
s
experimental
legion
had
hitherto
been
the
sole
representatives
in
portugal
as
to
the
cavalry
and
artillery
it
was
an
obvious
fact
that
the
dearth
of
horses
in
the
kingdom
made
it
impossible
to
enlarge
the
number
of
units
the
twelve
old
regiments
of
horse
the
old
batteries
of
artillery
were
to
be
reconstructed
but
no
new
ones
were
to
be
created
it
was
intended
however
to
give
each
cavalry
regiment
an
extra
squadron
considering
that
the
old
corps
of
officers
in
portugal
was
notoriously
incompetent
it
was
hard
to
see
how
the
expanded
army
was
to
be
drilled
and
disciplined
about
recruits
were
suddenly
shot
into
the
old
they
could
be
readily
procured
for
not
only
were
volunteers
forthcoming
in
great
numbers
but
if
they
ran
short
a
stringent
conscription
law
was
in
existence
but
how
were
the
regiments
to
be
officered
it
was
true
that
a
considerable
amount
of
the
raw
material
for
officers
was
obtainable
for
patriotic
enthusiasm
was
driving
the
young
men
of
the
upper
classes
into
the
army
in
a
way
that
had
never
before
been
seen
the
service
had
not
hitherto
been
popular
owing
to
its
poor
pay
and
prospects
but
one
can
not
officer
raw
recruits
with
equally
raw
ensigns
and
call
the
result
a
regular
army
moreover
arms
and
equipment
were
lamentably
deficient
junot
had
confiscated
and
destroyed
almost
all
the
store
of
arms
belonging
to
the
old
army
it
is
said
that
the
insurgents
had
not
serviceable
muskets
among
them
when
wellesley
landed
the
british
had
distributed
some
more
between
august
and
december
but
what
were
these
among
so
many
there
were
to
be
over
regulars
when
the
establishment
was
completed
and
the
regency
hoped
to
call
out
some
militia
when
the
first
line
of
defence
had
been
equipped
and
after
that

the
vast
masses

the
natural
results
followed
in
obedience
to
the
decree
issued
by
the
regency
a
considerable
number
of
men
were
collected
at
each
regimental
dépôt
of
these
about
on
an
average
were
old
soldiers
but
the
proportion
varied
for
some
corps
had
suffered
more
than
others
from
the
drafts
of
trained
men
which
junot
had
sent
off
to
france
a
good
many
of
the
regiments
succeeded
so
far
as
numbers
went
in
constituting
their
two
battalions
without
much
difficulty
others
were
less
fortunate
and
could
only
raise

so
hopelessly
incomplete
that
beresford
distributed
the
few
hundred
men
whom
they
could
produce
among
other
corps
and
temporarily
disbanded
them
it
was
the
same
with
the
cavalry
of
which
two
regiments
were
wholly
without
horses
and
several
were
so
absurdly
short
of
mounts
that
they
could
not
be
used
even
of
the
corps
which
were
not
dissolved
several
were
so
weak
that
they
had
not
recruited
themselves
up
to
half
their
nominal
strength
even
by
september
this
was
more
especially
the
case
in
the
alemtejo
where
the
population
displayed
an
apathy
that
contrasted
strongly
with
the
turbulent
enthusiasm
prevalent
in
lisbon
and
in
the
north

both
alemtejo
regiments
were
entirely
drafted
off

were

us
that
as
far

went
the
regency
had
not
done
so
much
as
it
should
in
the
way
of
increasing
the
total
of
men

the

followed

the
figures
are
very
moderate
but
the
worst
part
of
the
situation
was
that
a
collection
of
or
men
does
not
constitute
a
regiment
even
if
or
of

chance
to
have

were
still
more

yet
the
really
fatal
point
was
that
there
was
a
wholly
inadequate
number
of
officers
and
that
of
those
who
were
forthcoming
the
elder
men
were
mostly
incompetent
and
the
younger
entirely
untrained
in
the
official
correspondence
of
the
early
months
of
the
most
prominent
fact
that
emerges
is
the
difficulty
that
was
found
in
discovering
colonels
and
majors
capable
of
licking
into
shape
the
incoherent
mass
of
men
at
the
regimental
head
quarters
and
of
teaching
the
junior
officers
their
duty
it
seemed
that
their
long
in
small
garrison
towns
had
taken
all
energy
and
initiative
out
of
the
seniors
of
the
army
of
the
they
gazed
with
despair
on
the
task
before
them
and
seemed
quite
incapable
of
coping
with
it
when
a
british
general
took
over
the
command
of
the
portuguese
army
he
complained
that
long
habits
of
disregard
to
duty
and
consequent
laziness
make
it
not
only
difficult
but
almost
impossible
to
induce
the
senior
officers
of
this
service
to
enter
into
any
regular
and
continued
attention
to
the
duties
of
their
situations
and
neither
reward
nor
punishment
will
induce
them
to
bear
up
against
the
fatigue
it
was
only
when
a
whole
generation
of
colonels
had
been
cleared
away
that
the
army
grew
efficient
and
the
reorganized
regiments
began
to
distinguish
themselves

vi
for
the
purpose
of

every
regiment
had
been
sent
in
the

to
its
proper
head
quarters
in
the
centre
of
its
recruiting
district
there
they
still
lay
in
the
end
of
february
when
soult
was
drawing
near
the
frontier
there
was
absolutely
no
portuguese
army
in
the
field
only
a
number
of
battalions
squadrons
and
batteries
in
a
more
or
less
imperfect
state
of
organization
scattered
broadcast
over
the
country
they
were
as
we
have
already
seen
still
insufficiently
supplied
with
arms
and
equipment
of
transport
and
train
to
enable
them
to
move
there
was
hardly
a
trace
the
only
thing
approaching
a
concentration
of
force
was
that
in
lisbon
and
its
immediate
vicinity
there
were
seven
regiments
of
foot
and
three
of
horse
which
were
there
assembled
simply
because
their
head
quarters
and
their
recruiting
ground
lay
in
this
quarter
of
the
remainder
of
the
infantry
two
regiments
were
in

far
south

in

had
to
deal
when
he

not

in
which
their

lay

conscious
that
for

weapons
to
equip
it
and
money
to
pay
it
they
could
look
only
to
great
britain
the
regency
asked
in
february
for
the
appointment
of
a
british
this
was
the
best
pledge
that
they
could
give
of
their
honest
intention
to
place
all
their
military
resources
at
the
disposition
of
their
allies
it
had
another
obvious
advantage
bernardino
freire
leite
silveira
the
monteiro
mor
and
the
other
portuguese
generals
commanding
military
districts
were
at
feud
with
each
other
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
place
one
above
the
rest
and
to
secure
for
him
loyal
from
his
subordinates
it
was
probable
that
an
englishman
a
stranger
to
their
quarrels
and
intrigues
would
be
better
obeyed
the
regency
it
would
seem
suggested
that
they
would
be
glad
to
see
the
post
of
given
to
sir
arthur
wellesley
but
the
victor
of
vimiero
refused
to
accept
it
probably
because
he
had
already
secured
from
lord
castlereagh
the
promise
that
he
should
be
sent
out
again
to
portugal
to
supersede
cradock
when
he
had
declined
the
offer
it
was
to
the
surprise
of
most
men
passed
on
to
general
beresford
this
officer
had
the
advantage
of
knowing
portuguese
he
had
commanded
one
of
moore
s
brigades
during
the
corunna
retreat
and
had
seen
much
service
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
he
was
a
comparatively
young
man
being
only
in
his
year
and
was
very
junior
in
his
rank
having
only
become
a
in
many
officers
who
were
his
elders
had
coveted
the
post
and
some
friction
was
caused
by
the
fact
that
with
his
new
portuguese
commission
he
outranked
several
of
his
seniors
in
cradock
s
army
beresford
was
a
good
and
a
hard
worker
but
he
was
neither
a
tactician
nor
a
strategist
and
did
not
shine
when
placed
in
independent
command
as
witness
albuera
when
wellington
had
learnt
his
limitations
he
never
gave
him
a
task
of
any
great
difficulty
and
in
the
later
years
of
the
war
either
kept
him
under
his
own
eye
or
sent
him
on
errands
where
it
was
not
easy
to
go
wrong
for
really
responsible
work
in
he
always
used
hill
hope
or
graham
but
in
beresford
was
but
for
his
undoubted
courage
more
or
less
of
an
unknown
quantity
to
his
colleagues
and
his
subordinates
fortunately
he
turned
out
a
good
organizer
if
a
mediocre
general
for
what
he
did
in
the
way
of
reforming
and
almost
recreating
the
portuguese
army
he
deserves
considerable
credit
every
one
will
remember
the
quaint
story
of
how
he
was
received
by
his
army
after
a
short
absence
with
the
ingenuous
cry
of
long
live
marshal
beresford
who
takes
care
of
our
stomachs
this
in
one
way
was
a
high
compliment
it
was
not
every
general
english
french
or
spanish
who
succeeded
in
filling
his
soldiers
bellies
during
the
peninsular
war
the
power
to
do
so
was
not
the
least
among
the
qualities
necessary
for
a
the
same
story
is
told
of
general
robert
craufurd
and
his
cazadores
in
costello
s
why
the
british
cabinet
chose
beresford
from
among
many
possible
candidates
for
the
very
responsible
post
now
put
in
his
charge
it
is
hard
to
see
castlereagh
knew
him
as
being
like
himself
one
of
a
powerful
family
connexion
with
strong
parliamentary
influence
this
may
have
told
in
his
favour
it
was
perhaps
also
remembered
that
he
was
a
personal
friend
of
wellesley
whom
castlereagh
was
intending
to
send
out
to
command
the
british
army
in
portugal
and
moreover
his
junior
this
would
facilitate
matters
when
the
two
generalissimos
had
to
act
together
beresford
would
probably
prove
a
more
tractable
colleague
and
subordinate
to
the
autocratic
and
frigid
wellesley
than
any
officer
who
was
a
stranger
to
him
or
his
senior
in
years
and
service
it
is
by
no
means
impossible
that
castlereagh
nominated
him
at
sir
arthur
s
private
suggestion
but
into
the
secrets
of
ministerial
patronage
it
is
useless
to
pry
appointed
to
his
new
post
in
february
only
a
month
after
he
had
returned
from
the
corunna
expedition
beresford
at
once
set
sail
for
lisbon
and
took
up
the
command
ere
three
weeks
had
expired
since
his
appointment
he
arrived
at
the
very
moment
at
which
soult
was
about
to
pass
the
northern
frontier
and
was
at
once
gazetted
as
a
portuguese
field
marshal
after
a
short
survey
of
those
parts
of
his
command
which
lay
in
and
about
lisbon
he
reported
to
the
regency
that
the
dearth
of
officers
and
especially
of
competent
superior
officers
was
so
great
that
he
could
not
hope
to
reorganize
the
army
unless
he
were
allowed
to
give
commissions
in
the
portuguese
service
to
many
foreigners
as
a
preliminary
measure
he
asked
for
volunteers
from
sir
john
cradock
s
army
and
obtained
about
enough
english
officers
to
give
three
to
each
regiment
the
main
inducement
which
attracted
candidates
was
beresford
s
pledge
that
every
one
accepted
for
the
portuguese
service
should
gain
a
step
a
lieutenant
would
become
a
captain
a
captain
a
major
the
marshal
at
once
placed
all
the
battalions
with
notoriously
inefficient
commanders
in
charge
of
british
officers
and
drafted
into
them
a
larger
proportion
of
his
volunteers
than
was
given
to
those
which
were
in
better
state
he
also
got
leave
from
the
british
cabinet
to
offer
portuguese
commissions
to
officers
serving
in
corps
on
the
home
station
this
gave
him
by
the
end
of
the
year
some
scores
of
men
of
the
sort
required
and
it
was
by
them
that
the
new
army
was
mainly
formed
and
disciplined
the
british
drill
was
introduced
and
to
teach
it
beresford
was
allowed
to
borrow
many
officers
from
cradock
s
regiments
as
was
but
natural
there
arose
considerable
friction
between
the
new
comers
and
the
native
portuguese
officers
over
whose
heads
they
were
often
placed
this
was
inevitable
but
led
to
less
harm
than
might
have
been
expected
because
the
rank

those
stationed
beyond
the

were
already
in
the
field
and
actively
engaged
with
soult
they
had
hardly
received
any
assistance
either
of
officers
or
of
arms
and
equipment
before
they
became
involved
in
the
campaign
of
march
in
fairness
to
them
this
must
be
borne
in
mind
when
their
conduct
in
battle
is
compared
with
that
of
the
reorganized
army
in
the
following
year
the
portuguese
regency
in
their
report
on
the
oporto
campaign
sent
to
their
prince
on
may
pleaded
with
truth
that
the
armies
formed
in
the
northern
provinces
were
motley
assemblies
whose
numbers
and
good
will
bore
witness
to
the
zeal
of
the
people
and
their
determination
not
to
accept
the
french
yoke
but
which
could
not
with
any
propriety
be
called
regular
troops
they
were
composed
of
incomplete
and
fractional
regiments
and
the
larger
proportion
of
the
rank
and
file
consisted
of
recruits
many
of
whom
had
not
been
a
month
under
arms
some
of
the
corps
were
short
of
muskets
those
which
had
them
were
armed
with
weapons
of
bad
quality
and
various
calibre
all
were
deficient
in
the
most
essential
articles
of
equipment
it
was
not
fair
to
expect
that
such
troops
could
oppose
with
any
prospect
of
success
a
and
veteran
army
like
that
of
france
a
few
british
officers
had
arrived
such
as
patrick
who
commanded
the
of
the
line
in
silveira
s
army
some
of
the
muskets
sent
by
the
british
were
in
the
hands
of
the
oporto
troops
but
none
had
reached
the
regiments
of
silveira
s
army
all
this
is
analysed
from
the
portuguese
historian
da
luz
soriano
the
regular
troops
and
the
totally
undisciplined
levies
did
not
form
the
whole
military
force
of
portugal
there
also
existed
mainly
on
paper
another
line
of
defence
for
the
kingdom
this
was
the
militia
according
to
the
old
military
system
of
the
realm
each
regimental
district
had
to
supply
not
only
its
line
battalion
but
also
two
or
sometimes
one
battalions
of
militia
there
should
have
been
such
regiments
in
existence
in
and
early
in
the
regency
ordered
that
they
should
be
raised
to
and
that
each
should
consist
of
two
battalions
of
men
each
this
force
however
was
purely
a
paper
army
the
militia
had
not
been
called
out
since
the
war
of
there
were
a
few
officers
bearing
militia
commissions
but
no
rank
and
file
when
the
regency
decreed
its
mobilization
all
that
could
be
done
was
that
the
local
authorities
should
tell
off
such
eligible
young
men
as
had
not
been
embodied
in
the
regular
army
for
militia
recruits
but
as
there
were
neither
officers
to
drill
them
nor
muskets
to
arm
them
the
conscription
was
but
a
farce
the
men
were
not
even
called
out
in
many
districts
since
it
was
useless
to
do
so
till
arms
could
be
procured
for
them
but
in
the
two
northern
provinces
when
soult
crossed
the
frontier
the
took
the
field
alongside
with
the
from
whom
they
were
distinguished
by
name
alone
for
they
were
almost
as
destitute
of
uniform
weapons
and
officers
as
the
en
itself
it
would
seem
that
most
of
the
other
border
regiments
of
militia
were
also
mobilized
in
the
spring
of
in
the
neighbourhood
of
almeida
castello
branco
and
elvas
that
they
were
perfectly
useless
was
shown
in
mayne
s
fight
with
victor
at
the
bridge
of
alcantara
may
when
their
conduct
contrasted
shamefully
with
the
steady
and
obstinate
fighting
of
the
lusitanian
legion
in
june
wellesley
ordered
that
all
men
for
whom
there
were
no
arms
should
be
sent
home
on
furlough
and
that
the
regiments
should
endeavour
to
drill
and
exercise
their
men
by
relays
of
at
a
time
each
batch
being
kept
two
months
under
arms
this
was
apparently
because
there
were
not
arms
officers
or
enough
to
provide
for
more
than
a
small
proportion
of
the
available
number
of
in
this
way
between
and
militia
were
to
be
out
during
the
times
of
the
year
when
the
could
best
spare
them
from
the
labour
of
the
fields
the
rest
were
to
be
left
at
home
unless
an
actual
invasion
of
portugal
should
occur
from
the
modest
scope
of
this
plan
it
may
easily
be
guessed
what
the
state
of
the
militia
had
been
four
months
earlier
when
soult
was
in
the
and
beresford
had
barely
begun
his
work
of
reorganization
for
the
local
organization
and
nomenclature
of
the
militia
regiments
the
reader
is
referred
to
the
table
of
the
portuguese
army
in
appendix
ii
it
will
be
seen
that
there
were
theoretically
sixteen
regiments
in
the
provinces
invaded
by
soult
beyond
the
douro
see
mayne
of
the
loyal
lusitanian
and
vol
iv
vol
iv
pp
and
june
the
were
supposed
to
provide
their
own
uniforms
the
result
of
which
was
that
few
save
the
officers
ever
owned
uniforms
at
all
in
wellesley
had
to
make
formal
representation
to
masséna
that
they
were
part
of
the
armed
force
of
the
portuguese
kingdom
and
not
banditti
as
the
marshal
threatened
to
deny
the
rights
of
regular
combatants
to
any
prisoners
not
wearing
a
military
dress
the
officers
however
had
a
blue
uniform
similar
to
that
of
the
line
save
that
they
had
silver
instead
of
gold
lace
on
their
collars
and
wrists
the
militia
were
not
entitled
to
any
pay
when
mobilized
within
the
limits
of
their
own
province
when
taken
over
its
border
officers
and
men
were
supposed
to
draw
half
the
pay
of
the
regulars
of
corresponding
rank
but
did
not
find
it
easy
to
obtain
the
modest
stipend
to
which
they
were
entitled
throughout
the
war
the
portuguese
militia
were
only
intermittently
in
the
field
the
longest
continuous
piece
of
service
which
they
performed
was
that
during
masséna
s
invasion
when
they
were
all
mobilized
for
more
than
a
year
on
end
from
june
to
july
at
other
times
the
whole
or
parts
of
various
regiments
were
under
arms
for
periods
of
varying
length
either
to
relieve
the
regulars
from
garrison
duty
or
to
watch
the
frontier
points
in
times
when
the
french
were
active
in
the
neighbouring
districts
of
spain
they
were
very
seldom
exposed
to
the
ordeal
of
battle
as
their
presence
in
the
line
would
have
been
a
source
of
danger
rather
than
a
help
but
they
were
useful
for
secondary
work
such
as
guarding
convoys
maintaining
lines
of
communication
and
most
of
all
restraining
minor
raids
by
small
bodies
of
the
enemy
during
masséna
s
invasion
the
greater
part
of
them
were
not
drawn
within
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
like
the
portuguese
regulars
but
left
out
in
the
to
shift
for
themselves
here
they
did
invaluable
service
in
cutting
the
marshal
s
line
of
communication
with
spain
and
harassing
all
his
detachments
it
was
they
who
surprised
and
captured
his
wounded
and
his
dépôt
at
coimbra
who
worried
drouet
and
who
turned
back
gardanne
when
he
tried
to
push
forward
from
almeida
in
order
to
join
the
main
french
army
but
all
this
was
in
the
far
future
when
the
spring
campaign
of
began
at
that
date
as
we
have
already
seen
the
militia
were
as
undisciplined
as
and
as
useless
as
the
mass
of
levies
with
which
they
were
confused
a
word
must
be
added
as
to
the
theoretical
organization
of
this
last
force
it
dated
back
to
the
middle
ages
and
had
been
regularly
used
during
the
days
of
the
enfranchisement
of
portugal
from
the
yoke
of
the
spanish
hapsburgs
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
ordinance
was
a
royal
decree
summoning
to
arms
all
males
between
sixteen
and
sixty
with
the
exception
of
ecclesiastics
in
districts
owning
a
feudal
lord
that
person
was
declared
of
his
fief
and
charged
with
the
summoning
of
his
vassals
to
the
field
where
manorial
customs
had
disappeared
the
senior
magistrate
of
the
town
village
or
district
had
to
take
up
the
post
of
unless
a
substitute
was
named
by
the
crown
it
was
the
duty
of
this
commander
to
call
out
all
the
men
of
his
region
to
divide
them
into
companies
of
men
and
to
name
a
captain
ensign
sergeant
clerk
and
ten
corporals
for
each
of
these
bodies
persons
able
to
provide
a
horse
were
to
serve
apart
as
cavalry
under
separate
commanders
but
no
one
ever
saw
or
heard
of
mounted
troops
during
the
peninsular
war
all
the
horses
of
the
country
did
not
suffice
to
provide
chargers
even
for
the
twelve
regiments
of
the
regular
army
the
whole
levy
was
supposed
to
be
called
out
twice
a
year
by
the
in
order
that
it
might
be
seen
that
every
man
was
properly
enrolled
in
a
company
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
had
not
been
summoned
out
save
in
and
since
the
end
of
the
war
of
the
spanish
succession
nor
had
any
care
been
taken
to
see
that
every
householder
possessed
a
weapon
of
some
sort
as
the
law
directed
when
they
mustered
in
the
men
with
pikes
outnumbered
those
with
or
blunderbusses
and
the
men
furnished
with
no
more
than
scythes
on
poles
or
goads
or
rustic
weapons
were
far
more
numerous
than
the
pikemen
the
whole
mass
was
perfectly
useless
it
was
cruel
to
place
it
in
the
field
and
send
it
against
regular
troops
tumultuous
undisciplined
unofficered
it
was
doomed
to
massacre
whenever
it
allowed
the
enemy
to
approach
it
would
have
been
well
to
refrain
from
calling
it
out
altogether
and
to
turn
over
the
few
serviceable
arms
which
it
possessed
to
the
militia
by
far
the
best
account
of
the
portuguese
army
and
military
system
is
to
be
found
in
halliday

be

of
a
little
information

many

the

full

but
none

to
the

he
supposed

still
stationed
about

and
verin
on
the
very
day
upon
which
the
army
of

absconded
the
portuguese
general
sent
forward
a
detachment
consisting
of
a
line

and
a
mass
of
peasants
to
menace
the
flank
of
the
french
advance
this
force
having
crossed

spanish

got
into
collision
with
the

near
villaza
since
franceschi
s
horsemen
and
heudelet
s
infantry
had
turned
off
to
the
east
in
pursuit
of

the
portuguese
fell
in
with
the
leading
column
of
soult
s
main
body
a
brigade
of
lahoussaye
s
dragoons
supported
by
delaborde
s
division
this
force
they
ventured
to
attack
but
were
promptly
beaten
off
by
foy
the
brigadier
of
the
advanced
guard
who
routed
them
and
captured
their
sole
piece
of
artillery
the
shattered
column
fell
back
on
the
main
body
at
villarelho
and
then
silveira
hearing
of
the
departure
of
the
spaniards
resolved
to
retire
and
to
look
for
a
defensive
position
which
he
might
be
able
to
hold
by
his
own
unaided
efforts
there
was
none
such
to
be
found
in
front
of
chaves
for
the
valley
of
the
tamega
widens
out
between
monterey
and
the
portuguese
frontier
fortress
and
offers
no
ground
suitable
for
defence
accordingly
silveira
very
prudently
decided
to
withdraw
his
tumultuary
army
to
the
heights
of
san
pedro
a
league
to
the
south
of
the
town
where
the
space
between
the
river
and
the
mountains
narrows
down
and
offers
a
short
and
compact
line
of
resistance
but
he
waited
to
be
driven
in
and
meanwhile
left
in
observation
at
feces
de
abaxo
on
the
left
and
outeiro
on
the
right
bank
of
the
tamega
soult
halted
three
days
at
monterey
in
order
to
allow
his
rearguard
and
his
convoy
of
sick
to
close
up
with
the
main
body
but
on
march
he
resumed
his
advance
using
the
two
parallel
roads
on
the
two
banks
of
the
tamega
franceschi
s
light
horse
and
heudelet
s
division
pushed
down
the
eastern
side
caulaincourt
s
brigade
of
dragoons
and
delaborde
s
infantry
down
the
western
side
of
the
river
merle
and
mermet
were
still
near
verin
as
the
tamega
was
unfordable
in
most
places
the
army
seemed
dangerously
divided
but
soult
knew
well
that
he
was
running
little
or
no
risk
both
at
feces
and
outeiro
the
portuguese
detachments
which
covered
silveira

main
body
tried
to
offer
serious
resistance
they

of
course
routed
with
the
loss
of
a
gun
and
many
prisoners
of
lahoussaye
s
division
on
hearing
that
his
enemy
was
drawing
near
silveira
ordered
his
whole
army
to
retreat
behind
chaves
to
the
position
of
san
pedro
this
command
nearly
cost
him
his
life
the
ignorant
masses
of
militia
and
could
only
see
treason
in
the
proposed
move
which
abandoned
the
town
to
the
french
the
local
troops
refused
to
march
and
threatened
to
shoot
their
general
he
withdrew
with
such
of
his
men
as
would
still
obey
orders
but
a
mixed
multitude
consisting
of
part
of
the
regiment
of
the
line
the
chaves
regiment
and
a
mass
of
and
militia
remained
behind
to
defend
the
dilapidated
town
its
walls
had
never
been
repaired
since
the
spaniards
had
breached
them
in
of
the
fifty
guns
which
armed
them
the
greater
part
were
destitute
of
carriages
and
rusting
away
in
extreme
old
age
the
supply
of
powder
and
was
wholly
insufficient
for
even
a
short
siege
but
encouraged
by
the
advice
of
an
incompetent
engineer
officer
who
said
that
a
few
barricades
would
make
the
place
impregnable
men
shut
themselves
up
in
it
and
aided
by
armed
citizens
defied
soult
and
opened
a
furious
fire
upon
the
vedettes
which
he
pushed
up
to
the
foot
of
the
walls
the
marshal
sent
in
a
fruitless
summons
to
surrender
and
then
invested
the
place
on
the
evening
of
the
tenth
all
night
the
garrison
kept
up
a
haphazard
cannonade
and
shouted
defiance
to
the
french
next
morning
soult
resolved
to
drive
away
silveira
from
the
neighbouring
heights
convinced
that
the
spirits
of
the
defenders
of
chaves
would
fail
the
moment
that
they
saw
the
field
army
defeated
and
forced
to
abscond
the
divisions
of
delaborde
and
lahoussaye
soon
compelled
silveira
to
give
ground
he
displayed
indeed
a
laudable
prudence
in
refusing
to
let
himself
be
caught
and
surrounded
and
made
off
towards
villa
real
with
or
men
the
marshal
then
summoned
chaves
to
surrender
for
the
second
time
the
garrison
seem
to
have
tired
themselves
out
with
twelve
hours
of
patriotic
shouting
and
to
have
used
up
great
part
of
their
munitions
in
their
silly
nocturnal
fireworks
when
they
saw
silveira
driven
away
their
spirits
sank
and
they
allowed
their
leader
magelhaes
pizarro
to
capitulate
without
remonstrance
in
short
they
displayed
even
more
cowardice
on
the
eleventh
than
indiscipline
upon
the
tenth
of
march
on
the
twelfth
the
french
entered
the
city
in
triumph
brotherton
to
cradock
from
povoa
de
aguiar
march
he
was
called
magelhaes
pizarro
but
can
not
be
said
to
have
shown
either
the
endurance
of
the
portuguese
seaman
or
the
reckless
courage
of
the
spanish
whose
historic
names
he
bore
soult
was
much
embarrassed
by
the
multitude
of
captives
whom
he
had
taken
he
could
not
spare
an
escort
strong
enough
to
guard
prisoners
to
a
place
of
safety
accordingly
he
made
a
virtue
of
necessity
permitted
the
armed
citizens
of
chaves
to
retire
to
their
homes
and
dismissed
the
mass
of
and
after
extracting
from
them
an
oath
not
to
serve
against
france
during
the
rest
of
the
war
the
regulars
of
the
regiment
were
not
treated
in
the
same
way
the
marshal
offered
them
the
choice
between
captivity
and
enlisting
in
a
legion
which
he
proposed
to
raise
to
their
great
discredit
the
majority
both
officers
and
men
took
the
latter
alternative
though
it
was
with
the
sole
idea
of
deserting
as
soon
as
possible
at
the
same
moment
soult
made
an
identical
offer
to
the
spanish
prisoners
captured
from
mahy
s
division
at
the
combats
of
osoño
and
la
trepa
on
march
they
behaved
no
better
than
the
portuguese
several
hundred
of
them
took
the
oath
to
king
joseph
and
consented
to
enter
his
service
see
naylies
chamans
le
noble
and
des
odoards
the
duke
of
dalmatia
had
resolved
to
make
chaves
his
base
for
further
operations
in
portugal
he
brought
up
to
it
from
monterey
all
his
sick
and
wounded
including
those
who
had
been
transported
from
orense
the
total
now
amounted
to
of
whom
many
were
convalescents
already
fit
for
sedentary
duty
to
guard
them
a
single
company
of
a
french
regiment
and
the
inchoate
portuguese
legion
were
detailed
while
the
command
was
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
de
messager
the
flour
and
unground
wheat
found
in
the
place
fed
the
army
for
several
days
and
the
small
stock
of
powder
captured
was
utilized
to
replenish
its
depleted
supply
of
cartridges
from
chaves
soult
had
the
choice
of
two
roads
for
marching
on
oporto
the
more
obvious
route
on
the
map
is
that
which
descends
the
tamega
almost
to
its
junction
with
the
douro
and
then
strikes
across
to
oporto
by
amarante
and
penafiel
but
here
as
is
so
often
the
case
in
the
peninsula
the
map
is
the
worst
of
guides
the
road
along
the
river
frequently
pinched
in
between
the
water
and
overhanging
mountains
presents
a
series
of
defiles
and
strong
positions
is
considerably
longer
than
the
alternative
route
and
passes
through
difficult
country
wellnigh
from
start
to
finish
the
second
path
from
chaves
to
oporto
is
that
which
strikes
westward
crosses
the
serra
da
cabrera
and
descends
into
the
valley
of
the
cavado
by
ruivaens
and
salamonde
from
thence
it
leads
to
braga
on
the
great
from
valenza
to
oporto
the
first
two
or
three
stages
of
this
route
are
rough
and
difficult
and
pass
through
ground
even
more
defensible
than
that
on
the
way
to
amarante
and
penafiel
but
when
the
rugged
defiles
of
the
watershed
between
the
tamega
and
the
cavado
have
been
passed
and
the
invader
has
reached
braga
the
country
becomes
flat
and
open
and
the
coast
plain
crossed
by
two
excellent
roads
leads
him
easily
to
his
goal
it
has
also
to
be
remembered
that
by
adopting
this
alternative
soult
took
in
the
rear
the
portuguese
fortresses
of
the
lower
minho
and
made
it
easy
to
reopen
communications
with
tuy
and
the
french
forces
still
remaining
in
galicia
if
any
other
persuasion
were
needed
to
induce
the
marshal
to
take
the
western
and
not
the
eastern
road
to
oporto
it
was
the
knowledge
of
the
position
of
the
enemy
which
he
had
attained
by
diligent
cavalry
reconnaissances
it
was
ascertained
that
silveira
with
the
remains
of
his
division
had
fallen
back
to
villa
pouca
more
than
thirty
miles
away
in
the
direction
of
villa
real
he
could
not
be
caught
and
could
retreat
whithersoever
he
pleased
freire
on
the
other
hand
was
lying
at
braga
with
his
unwieldy
masses
and
had
made
no
attempt
to
march
forward
and
fortify
the
passes
of
the
serra
da
cabrera
by
all
accounts
that
the
horsemen
of
franceschi
could
gather
the
defiles
were
blocked
only
by
the
of
the
mountain
villages
this
astounding
news
was
absolutely
correct
freire
s
obvious
course
was
to
defend
the
rugged
watershed
where
positions
abounded
but
he
contented
himself
with
placing
mere
observation
posts
bodies
of
thirty
or
men
in
the
passes
while
keeping
his
main
army
concentrated
the
truth
was
that
he
was
in
a
state
of
deep
depression
of
mind
and
prepared
for
a
disaster
judging
from
the
line
which
he
adopted
in
the
previous
year
while
with
wellesley
in
the
campaign
against
junot
we
may
set
him
down
as
a
timid
rather
than
a
cautious
general
he
had
no
confidence
in
himself
or
in
his
troops
the
indiscipline
and
mutinous
spirit
of
the
motley
levies
which
he
commanded
had
reduced
him
to
despair
and
he
received
no
support
from
the
bishop
of
oporto
and
his
faction
who
were
omnipotent
in
the
province
repeated
demands
for
reinforcements
of
regular
troops
had
brought
him
nothing
but
the
battalion
of
the
lusitanian
legion
under
baron
eben
the
bishop
kept
back
the
greater
part
of
the
resources
of
which
he
could
dispose
for
the
defence
of
his
own
city
in
front
of
which
he
was
erecting
a
great
entrenched
camp
freire
had
also
called
on
the
regency
for
aid
but
they
had
done
no
more
than
order
two
line
battalions
under
general
vittoria
to
join
him
and
these
troops
had
not
yet
crossed
the
douro
when
he
heard
that
the
french
were
on
the
march
and
that
he
himself
would
be
the
next
to
receive
their
visit
he
so
far
lost
heart
that
he
contemplated
retiring
on
oporto
without
attempting
to
fight
instead
of
defending
the
defiles
of
ruivaens
and
salamonde
he
began
to
send
to
the
rear
his
heavy
stores
his
military
chest
and
his
artillery
of
position
this
timid
resolve
was
to
be
his
ruin
for
the
excitable
and
suspicious
multitude
which
surrounded
him
had
every
intention
of
defending
their
homes
and
could
only
see
treason
and
cowardice
in
the
preparations
for
retreat
in
a
few
days
their
fury
was
to
burst
forth
into
open
mutiny
to
the
destruction
of
their
general
and
their
own
ultimate
ruin
soult
meanwhile
had
set
out
from
chaves
on
march
with
franceschi
and
delaborde
at
the
head
of
his
column
as
they
had
been
in
all
the
operations
since
their
departure
from

lahoussaye

on
the

in
from

on
that
day
and
started
from
chaves
on
the
seventeenth
only
vialannes
brigade
of
dragoons
was
detached
these
two
regiments
were
directed
to
make
a
feint
upon
villa
real
with
the
object
of
frightening
and
distracting
silveira
lest
he
should
return
to
his
old
post
when
he
heard
that
the
french
army
had
departed
and
fall
upon
the
rear
of
the
marching
columns
they
beat
up
his
outposts
at
villa
pouca
announced
everywhere
the
marshal
s
approach
with
his
main
body
and
retired
under
cover
of
the
night
after
having
deceived
the
troops
for
a
couple
of
days
lorges
other
brigade
that
of
fournier
had
been
as
it
will
be
remembered
left
behind
in
galicia
with
marshal
ney
the
divisions
of
delaborde
and
franceschi
while
clearing
the
passes
above
chaves
met
with
a
desperate
but
futile
resistance
from
the
of
the
upper
cavado
valley
practically
unaided
by
freire
who
had
only
sent
to
the
defile
of
salamonde
regular
troops
a
miserable
mockery
of
assistance
the
gallant
peasantry
did
their
best
even
the
smallest
villages
wrote
an
of
soult
tried
to
defend
themselves
it
was
not
rare
to
see
a
peasant
barricade
himself
all
alone
in
his
house
and
fire
from
the
windows
on
our
men
till
his
door
was
battered
in
and
he
met
his
death
on
our
bayonets
the
portuguese
defended
themselves
with
desperation
and
never
asked
for
quarter
if
only
these
brave
and
devoted
fellows
had
possessed
competent
leaders
we
should
have
been
forced
to
give
up
the
expedition
or
else
we
should
never
have
got
out
of
the
country
but
their
resistance
was
individual
each
man
died
defending
his
hamlet
or
his
home
and
a
single
battalion
of
our
advanced
guard
easily
cleared
the
way
for
us
i
saw
during
these
days
young
girls
in
the
firing
on
us
and
meeting
their
death
without
recoiling
a
step
the
priests
had
told
them
that
they
were
martyrs
and
that
all
who
died
defending
their
country
went
straight
to
paradise
in
these
petty
combats
which
lasted
day
after
day
we
frequently
found
among
the
enemy
s
dead
monks
in
their
robes
their
crucifixes
still
clasped
in
their
hands
indeed
while
advancing
we
could
see
from
afar
these
ecclesiastics
passing
about
among
the
peasants
and
animating
them
to
the
combat
while
the
columns
were
on
the
march
isolated
peasants
kept
up
a
continual
dropping
fire
on
us
from
inaccessible
crags
above
the
road
at
night
they
attacked
our
sentries
or
crept
down
close
to
our
bivouacs
to
shoot
at
the
men
who
sat
round
the
blaze
this
sort
of
war
was
not
very
deadly
but
infinitely
fatiguing
there
was
not
a
moment
of
the
day
or
night
when
we
had
not
to
be
upon
the
moreover
every
man
who
strayed
from
the
ranks
whether
he
was
sick
drunk
tired
or
merely
a
marauder
was
cut
off
and
massacred
the
peasants
not
only
murdered
them
but
tortured
them
in
the
most
horrid
fashion
before
putting
them
to
death
every
french
diarist
of
soult
s
army
has
tales
of
the
stoic
courage
displayed
by
the
portuguese
clergy
a
story
from
naylies
of
lahoussaye
s
dragoons
may
serve
as
an
example
near
braga
he
came
on
a
cart
escorted
by
a
single
priest
with
a
gun
on
his
shoulder
he
was
the
chaplain
of
a
convent
who
was
taking
out
of
harm
s
way
a
party
of
nuns
when
he
saw
himself
overtaken
he
quietly
waited
in
the
middle
of

the

dragoon
dead
and
was
killed
by

he
was
trying

among

franceschi
and

forced
their
way
down
the
valley
of
the
cavado
till
they
arrived
at
the
village
of
carvalho

six
miles
from

where
they
found
a
range

hills
on

who
had
been
collected

also
to
sustain
several

soon
as
he
discovered

had
been
fooled

across
the
tamega
a

fell
upon

a
single

drove
them
off
without
much
difficulty
they
drew
back
to
their

side
of

did
not
quit
the

was
on

that

pushed
forward
to
the

of
the
portuguese
position
which
swept
round
in
a
semicircle
on

side
of

a

even
though
they
were
but
peasantry
and
militia
of
the
same
quality
as
the
horde
that
had
been
defeated
near
chaves
a
few
days
before
he
sent
back
word
to
the

and
drew
up
in

rocky
spur
of

projected
from

without
much
difficulty
the
advanced
guard
of
the
portuguese
the
possession
of
this
hill
gave
the
french
a
foothold
on
the
heights
and
an
advantageous
for
artillery
such
as
could
not
be
found
in
the
plain
below
it
was
three
days
before
the
rest
of
soult
s
army
joined
the
leading
division
not
until
the
twentieth
was
his
entire
force
with
the
exception
of
merle
s
infantry
concentrated
at
the
foot
of
the
enemy
s
position
and
ready
to
attack
this
long
period
of
waiting
when
every
mind
was
screwed
up
to
the
highest
pitch
of
excitement
had
completely
broken
down
the
nerve
of
the
portuguese
who
spent
the
hours
of
respite
in
hysterical
tumult
and
rioting
freire
as
we
have
already
seen
had
been
planning
a
retreat
on
oporto
but
he
found
the
spirit
of
his
army
so
exalted
that
he
thought
it
better
to
conceal
his
project
he
pretended
to
have
abandoned
the
idea
of
retiring
and
gave
orders
for
the
construction
of
entrenchments
and
batteries
on
the
monte
adaufé
to
enfilade
the
main
approach
by
the
but
he
could
not
disguise
his
nor
persuade
his
followers
to
trust
him
presently
the
wrecks
of
the
levies
who
had
fought
at
salamonde
fell
back
upon
braga
loudly
accusing
him
of
cowardice
for
not
supporting
them
in
their
advanced
position
the
whole
camp
was
full
of
shouting
objectless
firing
in
the
air
confused
cries
of
treason
and
mutinous
assemblies
on
the
day
when
the
french
appeared
in
front
of
the
position
freire
grew
so
alarmed
at
the
threats
against
his
life
which
resounded
on
every
side
that
he
secretly
quitted
braga
to
fly
to
oporto
but
he
was
recognized
and
seized
by
the
of
tobossa
a
few
miles
to
the
rear
they
brought
him
back
to
the
camp
as
a
prisoner
and
handed
him
over
to
baron
eben
the
colonel
of
the
battalion
of
the
lusitanian
legion
who
had
been
acting
as
freire
s
this
officer
an
ambitious
and
presumptuous
man
and
a
great
ally
of
the
bishop
of
oporto
played
the
demagogue
harangued
the
assembled
multitude
and
readily
took
over
the
charge
of
the
army
he
consigned
his
unfortunate
predecessor
to
the
gaol
of
braga
and
led
on
the
mutineers
to
reinforce
the
array
on
monte
adaufé
when
eben
had
departed
a
party
of
returned
to
the
city
dragged
out
the
wretched
freire
and
killed
him
in
the
street
with
their
pikes
the
same
afternoon
they
murdered
major
villasboas
the
chief
of
freire
s
engineers
and
one
or
more
of
his
they
also
seized
and
threw
into
prison
the
of
braga
and
several
other
persons
accused
of
sympathy
with
the
french
eben
appears
to
have
winked
at
these
atrocities
much
as
his
friend
the
bishop
of
oporto
ignored
the
murders
which
were
taking
place
in
that
city
by
assuming
command
in
the
irregular
fashion
that
we
have
seen
he
had
made
himself
the
slave
of
the
hysterical
horde
that
surrounded
him
and
had
to
let
them
do
what
they
pleased
lest
he
should
fall
under
suspicion
himself
i
agree
with
general
arteche
in
thinking
that
eben
s
dispatch
to
cradock
from
which
this
narrative
is
mainly
drawn
does
him
no
credit
indeed
it
is
easy
to
adopt
the
sinister
view
that
eben
was
aiming
at
getting
the
command
did
nothing
to
discourage
the
mob
and
was
indirectly
responsible
for
freire
s
murder
as
arteche
remarks
with
a
little
more
resolution
and
a
little
less
personal
ambition
the
baron
could
probably
have
prevented
the
catastrophe
vol
but
freire
s
conduct
had
been
so
cowardly
and
incapable
that
the
peasants
were
reasonably
incensed
with
him
why
had
he
not
defended
the
rugged
defiles
of
venda
nova
and
salamonde
and
what
could
excuse
his
absconding
and
abandoning
his
army
it
would
seem
however
that
eben
did
the
little
that
was
possible
with
such
material
in
preparing
to
oppose
soult
he
threw
up
more
entrenchments
on
the
monte
adaufé
mounted
the
few
guns
that
he
possessed
in
commanding
situations
and
did
his
best
to
add
to
the
lamentably
depleted
store
of
munitions
on
hand
even
the
church
roofs
were
stripped
for
lead
when
it
was
found
that
there
was
absolutely
no
reserve
of
cartridges
and
that
the
had
wasted
half
of
their
stock
in
demonstrations
and
profitless
firing
at
the
french
vedettes
on
the
morning
of
the
nineteenth
he
extended
his
right
wing
to
some
hills
below
the
monte
vallongo
beyond
the
village
of
lanhozo
a
movement
which
threatened
to
outflank
and
surround
that
part
of
the
french
army
which
was
in
front
of
him
and
to
cut
it
off
from
the
divisions
still
in
the
rear
this
could
not
be
tolerated
and
mermet
s
infantry
were
dispatched
to
dislodge
the
men
who
had
taken
up
this
advanced
position
they
were
easily
beaten
out
of
the
village
and
off
the
hill
and
retired
to
their
former
station
on
the
monte
vallongo
the
french
here
captured
two
guns
and
some
prisoners
soult
gave
these
men
copies
of
a
proclamation
which
he
had
printed
at
chaves
offering
pardon
to
all
portuguese
who
should
lay
down
their
arms
and
sent
them
back
into
eben
s
lines
under
a
flag
of
truce
when
the
discovered
what
the
papers
were
they
promptly
put
to
death
the
twenty
unfortunate
men
as
traitors
without
listening
to
their
attempts
to
explain
the
situation

the
morning
of

along

in
the
full
belief
that

about

told

lorges
dragoons
were
also
held
back
in

as
might
have
been
expected
soult
s
dispositions
were
completely
successful
when
the
columns
of
delaborde
and
heudelet
reached
the
foot
of
the
enemy
s
position
the
motley
horde
which
occupied
it
broke
out
into
wild
cheers
and
curses
and
opened
a
heavy
but
ineffective
fire
they
stood
as
long
as
the
french
were
climbing
up
the
slopes
but
when
the
infantry
debouched
on
to
the
plateau
of
monte
adaufé
they
began
to
waver
and
disperse
then
soult
let
loose
the
cavalry
of
lahoussaye
which
had
trotted
up
the
close
in

rear
of

the

leading
there
was
no

for
the
reeling
mass
of
peasants
to
escape
we
dashed
into
them
wrote
one
officer
who
took
part
in
the
charge
we
made
a
great
butchery
of
them
we
drove
on
among
them
right
into
the
streets
of
braga
and
we
pushed
them
two
leagues
further
so
that
we
covered
in
all
four
leagues
at
full
gallop
without
giving
them
a
moment
to
rally
their
guns
their
baggage
their

into

of

some
of

visit
to
the

and
to
murder
the
and
the
other

forcing
his
way
up
the
northern
slopes
of

the
enemy
broke
when
he
reached
the
plateau
but
as
he
had
no
heavy
force
of
cavalry
with
him
their
flight
was
not
so
disastrous
or
their
loss
so
heavy
as
in
the
centre
indeed
when
they
had
been
swept
down
into
the
valley
behind
the
ridge
some
of
the
portuguese
turned
to
bay
at
the
ponte

prado
and
inflicted
a
sharp
check
on
the
hanoverian
legion
the
leading
battalion
in
heudelet

advance
it
was
not
till
the
of

line
came
up
to
aid
the
germans
that
the
rallied
peasantry
again
broke
and
fled
they
only
lost

part
of
the
field
far
to
the
left
in
the
woods
on
the
slope
of
the
monte
vallongo
mermet
and
franceschi
had
found
it
much
harder
to
win
their
way
to
the
edge
of
the
plateau
than
had
the
troops
in
the
centre
but
it
was
only
the
physical
obstacles
that
detained
them
the
resistance
of
the
enemy
was
even
feebler
than
in
the
centre
by
the
time
that
the
infantry
of
mermet
emerged
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
the
battle
had
already
been
won
elsewhere
the
portuguese
right
wing
crumpled
up
the
moment
that
it
was
attacked
and
fled
devious
over
the
hillsides
followed
by
franceschi
s
cavalry
who
made
a
dreadful
slaughter
among
the
fugitives
five
miles
behind
their
original
position
a
body
of
militia
with
four
guns
rallied
under
the
cliffs
on
which
stands
the
village
of
falperra
the
cavalry
held
them
in
check
till
mermet
s
leading
regiment
the
léger
came
up
and
then
attacked
by
both
arms
at
once
the
whole
body
was
ridden
down
and
almost
exterminated
the
commencement
was
a
fight
the
end
a
butchery
wrote
an
officer
of
the
if
our
enemies
had
been
better
armed
and
less
ignorant
of
the
art
of
war
they
might
have
made
us
pay
dearly
for
our
victory
but
for
lack
of
muskets
they
were
half
of
them
armed
with
pikes
only
they
could
not
manœuvre
in
the
least
how
was
such
a
mob
to
resist
us
they
could
only
have
held
their
ground
if
they
had
been
behind
stone
walls
fantin
des
odoards
the
rout
and
pursuit
died
away
in
the
southern
valleys
beyond
braga
and
soult
could
take
stock
of
his
victory
he
had
captured
seventeen
guns
five
flags
and
the
whole
of
the
stores
of
eben
s
army
he
had
killed
according
to
his
own
estimate
some
men
and
taken
only
prisoners
this
shocking
disproportion
between
the
dead
and
the
captives
was
caused
by
the
fact
that
the
french
in
most
parts
of
the
field
had
given
no
quarter
some
of
their
historians
explain
that
their
cruelty
resulted
from
the
discovery
that
the
portuguese
had
been
murdering
and
mutilating
the
stragglers
who
fell
into
their
hands
but
it
was
really
due
to
the
exasperation
of
spirit
that
always
accompanies
guerrilla
warfare
constantly
worried
by
petty
ambushes
sniped
in
their
bivouacs
never
allowed
a
moment
of
rest
the
soldiers
were
in
a
state
of
nervous
irritation
which
found
vent
in
needless
and
unjustifiable
cruelty
in
the
fight
they
had
lost
only
forty
killed
and
wounded
figures
which
afford
no
excuse
for
the
wholesale
slaughter
in
the
pursuit
to
which
they
gave
themselves
up
eben
in
his
report
to
cradock
at
the
record
office
says
only
of
whom
more
than
belonged
to
the
lusitanian
legion
le
noble
chamans
naylies
and
fantin
des
odoards
though
both
mentioning
the
slaughter
in
which
they
took
part
do
not
give
this
justification
for
it
the
latter
says
that
the
french
gave
no
quarter
save
to
men
in
uniform
in
the
first
flush
of
victory
the
french
supposed
that
they
had
made
an
end
of
the

at
their

right

the
entrenched
positions
opposite
him
after
feeling
them
with
caution
he
pushed
a
column
to
a
small
bridge
at
san
justo
which
had
been
barricaded
but
not
broken
here
he
established
by
night
a
heavy
battery
commanding
the
opposite
bank
on
the
morning
of
the
he
opened
fire
on
the
portuguese
positions
across
the
water
and
when
the
enemy
had
been
well
battered
hurled
the
brigade
of
general
foy
at
the
fortified
bridge
it
was
carried
and
delaborde
s
division
was
beginning
to
pass
when
it
met
another
french
force
debouching
on
the
same
point
this
was
composed
of
mermet
and
franceschi
s
men
they
had
beaten
the
local
at
guimaraens
crossed
the
avé
high
up
and
were
now
pushing
along
the
southern
bank
to
take
the
barca
de
trofa
position
in
the
flank
thus
soult
found
that
even
if
his
frontal
assault
at
san
justo
had
failed
his
column
would
have
cleared
the
way
for
him
a
few
hours
later
being
already
across
the
river
and
in
the
enemy
s
rear
indeed
his
lateral
detachment
had
done
all
that
he
had
expected
from
it
and
at
no
great
cost
for
though
the
had
opposed
it
bravely
enough
they
had
never
been
able
to
hold
it
back
the
only
notable
loss
that
had
been
sustained
was
that
of
general
jardon
one
of
mermet
s
brigadiers
who
had
met
his
death
by
his
own
recklessness
finding
his
men
checked
for
a
moment
he
had
seized
a
musket
and
charged
on
foot
at
the
head
of
his
skirmishing
line
this
was
not
the
place
for
a
and
jardon
died
unnecessarily
doing
the
work
of
a
finding
the
french
across
the
river
at
san

the
portuguese
who
were
defending
the
lower
bridges
had
to
give
way
or
they
would
have
been
surrounded
and
cut
off
they
yielded
unwillingly
and
at
ponte
de
avé
actually
beat
off
the
first
attempt
to
evict
them
but
in
the
end
they
had
to
fly
abandoning
the
artillery
in
the
redoubts
that
covered
the
two

le

following

that
the
portuguese
murdered
their
commander
vallongo
when
the
bridges
were
forced
tore
him
in
pieces
and
buried
his
scattered
members
in
a
dunghill
it
is
a
relief
to
know
from
da

the
portuguese
historian
that
nothing
of
the

that
there

on

in

an
enormous

at

he
refused
any

assassination
which

been
prevailing
in
the
city

since

the
bishop
though
he
had
regular
troops
at
hand
made
no
attempt
to
intervene
he
could
not
stand
in
the
way
of
the
righteous
vengeance
of
the
people
upon

the
night
of
the
he
retired
to
a
place

the

across
the

after
bestowing
his
solemn
benediction
upon
the
garrison
and
handing
over
the
further
conduct
of
the
defence
to
the
three
generals
whose
names
we
have
already
cited
the
town
of
oporto
was
hidden
from
soult
s
eyes
by
the
range
of
heights
crowned
by
fortifications
which
lay
before
him
for
the
place
was
built
entirely
upon
the
downslope
of
the
hill
towards
the
douro
and
was
invisible
till
those
approaching
it
were
within
half
a
mile
of
its
outer
buildings
it
is
a
town
of
steep
streets
running
down
to
the
water
and
meeting
at
the
foot
of
the
great
more
than
yards
long
which
links
it
to
the
transpontine
suburb
of
villa
nova
and
the
adjacent
height
of
the
serra

the

front
forms
a
broad
quay
along
which
were
lying
at
the
time
nearly
thirty
merchant
ships
mostly
english
vessels
laden
with
port
wine
which
were
by
a
persistent
and
could
not
cross
the
bar
and
get
out
to
sea
although
his
previous
attempts
to
negotiate
with
the
portuguese
had
not
been
very
fortunate
the
marshal
thought
it
worth
while
to
send
proposals
for
an
accommodation
to
the
bishop
he
warned
him
not
to
expose
his
city
to
the
horrors
of
a
sack
pointed
out
that
the
raw
levies
of
the
garrison
must
inevitably
be
beaten
and
assured
him
that
the
french
came
not
as
enemies
but
as
the
deliverers
of
portugal
from
the
yoke
of
the
english
it
was
for
the
benefit
of
these
aliens
alone
that
the
bishop
would
expose
oporto
to
the
incalculable
calamities
attending
a
storm
the
bearer
of
the
marshal
s
letter
was
a
portuguese
major
taken
prisoner
at
braga
who
would
have
been
massacred
at
the
outposts
if
he
had
not
taken
the
precaution
of
explaining
to
his
countrymen
that
soult
had
sent
him
in
to
propose
the
surrender
of
the
french
army
which
was
appalled
at
the
formidable
series
of
defences
to
which
it
found
itself
opposed
the
reply
sent
by
the
bishop
and
his
council
of
war
was
of
course
defiant
and
bickering
along
the
front
of
the
lines
immediately
began
while
the
white
flag
was
still
flying
general
foy
the
most
distinguished
of
soult
s
brigadiers
trespassed
by
some
misconception
within
the
portuguese
picquets
and
was
made
prisoner
while
being
conducted
into
the
town
he
was
nearly
murdered
being
mistaken
for
loison
for
whom
the
inhabitants
of
oporto
nourished
a
deep
hatred
le
noble
some
of
the
french
writers
say
that
foy
was
taken
prisoner
while
carrying
a
flag
of
truce
and
a
second
letter
for
the
bishop
s
eye
but
what
really
seems
to
have
happened
was
that
he
conceived
a
notion
that
one
of
the
portuguese
outposts
wished
to
surrender
rode
in
amongst
them
and
began
to
urge
them
to
lay
down
their
arms
but
they
seized
him
and
sent
him
to
the
rear
his
companion
the
de
roger
drew
his
sword
and
tried
to
cut
his
way
back
to
his
men
whereupon
he
was
bayonetted
one
can
not
blame
the
portuguese
for
officers
in
time
of
truce
have
no
right
to
come
within
the
enemy
s
lines
still
less
to
urge
his
troops
to
desertion
foy
proved
that
he
was
not
loison
by
holding
up
his
two
hands
loison
being
as
his
nickname
shows
the
populace
at
once
saw
that
they
had
made
a
mistake

gives
a
version
unfavourable
to
the
portuguese
on
finding
that
the
portuguese
were
determined
to
fight
soult
began
his
preparations
for
a
general
assault
upon
the
following
day
he
drove
in
the
enemy
s
outposts
outside
the
town
and
captured
one
or
two
small
redoubts
in
front
of
the
main
line
having
reconnoitred
the
whole
position
he
told
off
delaborde
and
franceschi
to
attack
the
front
mermet
and
one
brigade
of
lahoussaye
s
dragoons
to
storm
the
central
parts
of
the
lines
due
north
of
the
city
where
the
fortifications
were
most
formidable
merle
and
the
other
brigade
of
lahoussaye
to
press
in
upon
the
western
entrenchments
below
the
city
there
was
no
general
reserve
save
lorges
two
regiments
of
cavalry
and
these
had
the
additional
task
imposed
upon
them
of
fending
off
any
attack
on
the
rear
of
the
army
which
might
be
made
by
scattered
bodies
of
who
were
creeping
out
into
the
woods
along
the
and
threatening
to
turn
the
marshal
s
right
flank
soult
had
but
men
available
of
whom
were
cavalry
and
therefore
could
not
be
employed
till
the
infantry
should
have
broken
through
the
line
of
fortifications
which
completely
covered
the
portuguese
front
nevertheless
he
had
no
doubts
of
the
result
though
he
had
to
storm
works
defended
by
men
and
lined
with
cannon
he
now
knew
the
exact
fighting
value
of
the
portuguese
levies
and
looked
upon
oporto
as
his
own
the
marshal
s
plan
was
not
to
repeat
the
simple
and
simultaneous
frontal
attack
all
along
the
line
by
which
he
had
carried
the
day
at
braga
there
was
a
good
deal
of
strategy
in
his
design
the
two
flank
divisions
were
ordered
to
attack
while
the
centre
was
for
a
time
held
back
merle
in
especial
was
directed
to
do
all
that
he
could
against
the
weakest
point
of
the
portuguese
line
in
the
comparatively
level
ground
to
the
west
of
the
city
soult
hoped
that
a
heavy
attack
in
this
direction
would
lead
the
enemy
to
reinforce
his
left
from
the
reserves
of
his
centre
and
gradually
to
disgarnish
the
formidable
positions
north
of
the
city
when
no
attack
was
made
on
them
if
they
committed
this
fault
he
intended
to
hurl
mermet
s
division
which
he
carefully
placed
under
cover
till
the
critical
moment
at
the
central
redoubts
a
successful
assault
at
this
point
would
finish
the
game
as
it
would
cut
the
portuguese
line
in
two
and
allow
the
troops
to
enter
the
upper
quarters
of
the
city
in
their
first
rush
the
french
were
under
arms
long
ere
dawn
waiting
for
the
signal
to
attack
the
portuguese
also
were
awake
and
stirring
in
the
darkness
when
at
three
o
clock
a
thunderstorm
accompanied
by
a
terrific
hurricane
from
the
swept
over
the
city
in
the
midst
of
the
elemental
din
some
of
the
portuguese
sentinels
thought
that
they
had
seen
the
french
columns
advancing
to
the
assault
they
fired
the
artillery
followed
their
example
and
for
half
an
hour
the
noise
of
the
thunderstorm
was
rivalled
by
that
of
guns
of
position
firing
at
nothing
just
as
the
gunners
had
discovered
their
mistake
the
tempest
passed
away
and
soon
after
the
day
broke
so
drenched
and
weary
were
the
french
who
had
been
lying
down
under
the
torrential
rain
that
soult
put
off
the
assault
for
an
hour
in
order
to
allow
them
to
dry
themselves
and
take
some
refreshment
the
pause
also
allowed
the
sodden
ground
to
harden
at
seven
all
was
again
ready
and
merle
s
and
delaborde
s
regiments
hurled
themselves
at
the
entrenchments
above
and
below
the
city
both
made
good
progress
especially
the
former
who
lodged
themselves
in
the
houses
and

immediately
under
the
main
line
of
the
portuguese
left
wing
and
captured
several
of
its
outlying
defences
seeing
the
position
almost
forced
parreiras
the
commander
of
the
central
part
of
the
lines
acted
just
as
soult
had
hoped
and
sent
most
of
his
reserve
to
reinforce
the
left
the
marshal
then
bade
merle
halt
for
a
moment
but
ordered
delaborde
on
his
eastern
flank
to
push
on
as
hard
as
he
could
the
general
obeyed
and
charged
right
into
the
portuguese
entrenchments
capturing
several
redoubts
and
actually
breaking
the
line
and
getting
a
lodgement
in
the
corner
of
the
city
parreiras
to
aid
his
colleague
in
this
quarter
drew
off
many
of
his
remaining
troops
and
sent
them
away
to
the
right
thereby
leaving
his
own
section
of
the
line
only
half
manned
thereupon
soult
launched
against
the
central
redoubts
his
main
assaulting
column
mermet
s
division
and
the
two
regiments
of
dragoons
the
central
battalion
went
straight
for
the
main
position
above
the
where
the
great
portuguese
flag
was
flying
on
the
strongest
redoubt
the
others
attacked
on
each
side
this
assault
was
decisive
the
portuguese
gunners
had
only
time
to
deliver
two
ineffective
salvos
when
the
french
were
upon
them
they
charged
into
the
redoubts
through
the
embrasures
pulled
down
the
connecting
abattis
and
swept
away
the
depleted
garrison
in
their
first
rush
the
line
of
the
defenders
was
hopelessly
broken
and
mermet
s
division
hunted
them
down
the
streets
leading
to
the
river
at
full
speed
the
centre
being
thus
driven
in
the
portuguese
wings
saw
that
all
was
lost
and
gave
way
in
disorder
looking
only
for
a
line
of
retreat
vittoria
with
the
right
wing
abandoned
his
section
of
the
city
and
retreated
east
along
the
vallongo
road
towards
the
interior
he
got
away
without
much
loss
and
even
turned
to
bay
and
skirmished
with
the
pursuing
battalions
of
delaborde
when
once
he
was
clear
of
the
suburbs
far
other
was
the
lot
of
the
portuguese
left
wing
which
had
the
sea
behind
it
instead
of
the
open
country
general
its
commander
was
killed
by
his
own
men
he
had
given
orders
to
spike
the
guns
and
double
to
the
rear
the
moment
that
he
saw
the
central
redoubts
carried
unfortunately
for
himself
he
was
among
a
mass
of
men
who
wished
to
hold
on
to
their
entrenchments
in
spite
of
the
disaster
on
their
right
when
he
reiterated
his
order
to
retreat
he
was
shot
down
for
a
traitor
but
merle
s
division
soon
evicted
his
slayers
and
sent
them
flying
towards
joão
da
foz
and
the
sea
there
was
a
dreadful
slaughter
of
the
portuguese
in
this
direction
some
escaped
across
the
river
in
boats
a
large
body
slipped
round
merle
s
flank
and
got
away
to
the
north
along
the
coast
though
lorges
dragoons
pursued
them
among
the
woods
above
the
water
and
sabred
many
others
threw
themselves
into
the
citadel
of
joão
and
capitulated
on
terms
but
several
thousands
pressed
into
the
angle
between
the
douro
and
the
ocean
were
slaughtered
almost
without
resistance
or
rolled
into
the
water
the
fate
of
the
portuguese
centre
was
no
less
horrible
their
commander
parreiras
fled
early
and
got
over
the
bridge
to
report
to
the
bishop
the
ruin
of
his
army
the
main
horde
followed
him
though
many
lingered
behind
endeavouring
to
defend
the
barricades
in
the
streets
when
several
thousands
had
passed
the
river
some
unknown
officer
directed
the
drawbridge
between
the
central
pontoons
to
be
raised
in
order
to
prevent
the
french
from
following
this
was
done
while
the
larger
part
of
the
armed
multitude
was
still
on
the
further
bank
hurrying
down
towards
the
sole
way
of
escape
nor
was
it
only
the
whose
retreat
was
cut
off
when
the
news
ran
round
the
city
that
the
lines
were
forced
the
civil
population
had
rushed
down
to
the
quays
to
escape
before
the
sack
began
it
was
fortunate
that
half
the
people
had
left
oporto
during
the
last
two
days
and
taken
refuge
in
beira
but
tens
of
thousands
had
lingered
behind
full
of
confidence
in
their
entrenchments
and
their
army
of
defenders
a
terrified
mass
of
men
women
and
children
now
came
pouring
down
to
the
bridge
and
mingled
with
the
remnants
of
the
routed
garrison
the
pontoons
were
still
swinging
safely
on
their
cables
and
no
one
save
those
in
the
front
of
the
rush
discovered
that
there
was
a
fatal
gap
in
the
middle
of
the
passage
where
the
drawbridge
had
been
raised
there
was
no
turning
back
for
those
already
embarked
on
the
bridge
for
the
crowds
behind
continued
to
push
them
on
and
it
was
impossible
to
make
them
understand
what
had
happened
the
french
had
now
begun
to
appear
on
the
quays
and
to
attack
the
rear
of
the
unhappy
multitude
their
musketry
drowned
the
cries
of
those
who
tried
to
turn
back
at
the
same
time
the
battery
on
the
serra
hill
beyond
the
river
opened
upon
the
french
and
the
noise
of
its
twenty
heavy
guns
made
it
still
more
impossible
to
convey
the
news
to
the
back
of
the
crowd
for
more
than
half
an
hour
it
is
said
the
rush
of
fugitives
kept
thrusting
its
own
front
ranks
into
the
forty
feet
broad
in
the
midst
of
the
bridge
if
anything
more
was
needed
to
add
to
the
horror
of
the
scene
it
was
supplied
by
the
sudden
rush
of
a
squadron
of
portuguese
cavalry
which
cut
off
from
retreat
to
the
east
galloped
down
from
a
side
street
and
ploughed
its
way
into
the
thickest
of
the
crowd
at
the
trampling
down
hundreds
of
victims
till
it
was
brought
to
a
standstill
by
the
mere
density
of
the
mass
into
which
it
had
penetrated
so
many
persons
at
last
were
thrust
into
the
water
that
not
only
was
the
whole
surface
of
the
douro
covered
with
drowning
wretches
but
the
gap
in
the
bridge
was
filled
up
by
a
solid
mass
of
the
living
and
the
dead
over
this
horrid
gangway
as
it
is
said
some
few
of
the
fugitives
scrambled
to
the
opposite
bank
le
noble
and
napier
following
him
state
that
the
breach
in
the
bridge
was
caused
merely
by
some
of
the
central
pontoons
sinking
under
the
weight
of
the
passing
multitude
hennegan
who
was
present
in
oporto
that
day
says
the
same
but
it
seems
safer
to
follow
da
luz
soriano
and
other
portuguese
witnesses
who
state
that
no
such
accident
occurred
but
that
the
early
fugitives
pulled
up
the
drawbridge
in
order
to
stay
the
pursuit
reckless
as
to
the
fate
of
those
who
were
behind
them
historians
telling
a
story
to
the
discredit
of
their
own
party
may
generally
be
trusted
at
first
the
french
who
had
fought
their
way
down
to
the
quay
had
begun
to
fire
upon
the
rear
of
the
multitude
which
was
struggling
to
escape
but
they
soon
found
that
no
resistance
was
being
offered
and
saw
that
the
greater
part
of
the
flying
crowd
was
composed
of
women
children
and
the
sight
was
so
sickening
that
their
musketry
died
down
and
when
they
saw
the
unfortunate
portuguese
thrust
by
thousands
into
the
water
numbers
of
them
turned
to
the
charitable
work
of
helping
the
strugglers
ashore
and
saved
many
lives
the
others
cleared
the
by
forcing
the
fugitives
back
with
the
butt
ends
of
their
muskets
and
edging
them
along
the
quays
and
into
the
side
streets
till
the
way
was
open
in
the
late
afternoon
some
of
mermet
s
troops
mended
the
gap
in
the
bridge
with
planks
and
rafters
and
crossed
it
despite
of
the
irregular
fire
of
the
portuguese
battery
on
the
heights
above
they
then
pushed
into
the
transpontine
suburb
expelled
its
defenders
and
finally
climbed
the
serra
hill
and
captured
the
guns
which
had
striven
to
prevent
their
passage
meanwhile
the
parts
of
oporto
remote
from
the
had
been
the
scene
of
a
certain
amount
of
desultory
fighting
many
small
bodies
of
the
garrison
had
barricaded
themselves
in
houses
and
made
a
desperate
but
ineffectual
attempt
to
defend
them
in
the
bishop
s
palace
at
the
south
end
of
the
town
militia
held
out
for
some
hours
and
were
all
bayonetted
when
the
gates
were
at
last
burst
open
always
ends
in
rapine
rape
and
arson
and
as
the
resistance
died
down
the
victors
turned
their
hands
to
the
usual
atrocities
that
follow
a
storm
it
was
only
a
small
proportion
of
them
who
had
been
sobered
and
sickened
by
witnessing
the
catastrophe
on
the
bridge
the
rest
dealt
with
the
houses
and
with
the
inhabitants
after
the
fashion
usual
in
the
sieges
of
that
day
and
oporto
was
thoroughly
sacked
it
is
to
the
credit
of
soult
that
he
used
every
exertion
to
beat
the
soldiers
off
from
their
prey
and
restored
order
long
ere
the
following
morning
it
is
to
be
wished

lucky

than

and
wounded
an
extraordinary
testimony
to
the
badness
of
the
portuguese
gunnery
how
many
of
the
garrison
and
the
populace
perished
it
will
never
be
possible
to
ascertain
the
figures
given
by
various
contemporary
authorities
run
up
from
to
the
smaller
number
is
probably
nearer
the
truth
but
no
satisfactory
estimate
can
be
made
it
is
certain
that
some
of
the
regiments
which
took
part
in
the
defence
were
almost
annihilated
and
that
thousands
of
the
inhabitants
were
drowned
in
the
river
yet
the
town
was
not
depopulated
and
of
its
defenders
the
greater
proportion
turned
up
sooner
or
later
in
the
ranks
of
silveira
botilho
and
trant
the
slain
and
the
drowned
together
may
perhaps
be
roughly
estimated
at
or
about
equally
divided

combatants
and
the
of
the
line
had
even
in
september
nearly
six
months
after
the
storm
only
men
under
arms
soult
meanwhile
could
report
to
his
master
that
the
first
half
of
his
orders
had
been
duly
carried
out
he
had
captured
cannon
a
great
store
of
english
ammunition
and
military
equipment
and
more
than
thirty
merchant
vessels
laden
with
wine
he
had
delivered
foy
and
some
dozens
of
other
french
captives
for
it
would
be
doing
the
portuguese
injustice
to
let
it
be
supposed
that
they
had
killed
or
tortured
all
their
prisoners
in
short
the
victory
and
the
trophies
were
splendid
yet
the
marshal
was
in
reality
almost
as
far
from
having
completed
the
conquest
of
northern
portugal
as
on
the
day
when
he
first
crossed
its
frontier
he
had
only
secured
for
himself
a
new
base
of
operation
to
supersede
chaves
and
braga
for
the
next
month
he
could
do
no
more
than
endeavour
ineffectually
to
complete
the
subjugation
of
one
single
province
the
main
task
which
his
master
had
set
before
him
the
capture
of
lisbon
he
was
never
able
to
contemplate
much
less
to
take
in
hand
like
so
many
other
french
generals
in
the
peninsula
he
was
soon
to
find
that
victory
is
not
the
same
thing
as
conquest
the

soult
was
no

driven
forward
by
the
imperative
necessity
for
finding
new
resources
to
feed
his
troops
nor
forced
to
hurry
on

if

would
run

he
had
at

leisure
to
halt
and
take
stock

his
position
the
most
striking
point
in
the
situation
was
that
he
was
absolutely
ignorant
of
the
general
course
of
the
war
in
the
other
regions
of
the
peninsula
when
he
had
been
directed
to

had
been
assured
that
he
might
count
on
the
of
lapisse
who
was
to
advance
from

with
his
men
and
of

who
was
to
stretch
out
to
him

helping
hand
from
the
valley
of
the

it
was
to
know
how
far
the
promised

was
being
given

the

could
learn
nothing
more
than
two
months
had
now
elapsed
since
he
had
received
any
dispatches

it
was

had
been
brought
to
him

it
will
be
remembered
just
as
he
was
about
to
leave

that
moment
the
duke
of
elchingen
had
been
able
to
tell
him
nothing
save
that
the
communications
between
galicia
and
leon
had
been
broken
and
that
the
insurrection
was
daily
growing
more
formidable
after
this
his
only
glimpse
of
the
outer
world
had
been
afforded
by
portuguese
letters
seized
in
the
of
braga

oporto
from
which
he
had
learnt
that
his
garrisons
left

the

of
the

army
which
had
retired
to
the
line
of
the
vouga

half

remained
in
garrison
at

from

the
other
brigade
of
lahoussaye
s
division
supported
by
foy

infantry
was
sent
out
on

expedition
towards
the
with
orders
to
brush
away
silveira
and
seek
for
news
of
the
expected
approach
of

loison
was
placed
in
command
of
this
detachment
finally
heudelet
s
division
which
had
been
guarding
the
sick
and
the
stores
of
the
army
at
braga
was
ordered
to
send
on
all
the
to
oporto
and
then
to
prepare
to
march
northward
in
order
to
relieve
tuy
and
vigo
and
to
get
into
touch
with
ney
and
the
corps
it
was
clear
that
the
further
movements
of
the
duke
of
dalmatia
would
depend
on
the
intelligence
which
loison
and
heudelet
might
obtain
if
ney
should
have
crushed
the
galician
insurgents
if
lapisse
should
be
met
with
somewhere
on
the
borders
of
spain
matters
would
look
well
for
the
resumption
of
the
advance
on
lisbon
it
was
also
to
be
hoped
that
lapisse
would
be
able
to
give
some
information
as
to
the
doings
of
victor
and
the
corps
for
it
was
necessary
to
find
out
how
the
duke
of
belluno
had
been
faring
in
estremadura
and
to
know
whether
he
was
prepared
to
in
that
general
movement
against
the
portuguese
capital
which
the
emperor
had
prescribed
in
his
parting
instructions
from
valladolid
as
a
matter
of
fact
victor
having
beaten
cuesta
at
medellin
on
the
day
before
soult
captured
oporto
march
had
reached
the
end
of
his
initiative
and
was
now
lying
at
merida
incapable
according
to
his
own
conception
of
any
further
offensive
movement
till
he
should
have
received
heavy
reinforcements
ney
in
galicia
was
fighting
hard
against
the
insurgents
and
beginning
to
discover
that
though
he
might
rout
them
a
dozen
times
he
could
not
make
an
end
of
them
he
had
not
a
man
to
spare
for
soult
s
assistance
there
remained
lapisse
who
in
his
central
position
at
salamanca
should
have
been
according
to
napoleon
s
design
the
link
between
ney
victor
and
soult
he
had
been
directed
as
it
will
be
remembered
to
move
on
ciudad
rodrigo
and
almeida
to
capture
both
these
fortresses
and
then
to
advance
into
portugal
and
to
strike
at
abrantes
when
he
arrived
there
it
was
hoped
that
he
would
find
soult
on
his
right
and
victor
on
his
left
and
would
join
them
in
the
general
assault
on
lisbon
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
napoleon
was
giving
too
heavy
a
task
to
lapisse
he
had
but
a
single
division
of
infantry
though
it
was
a
strong
one
of
twelve
battalions
and
one
provisional
brigade
of
cavalry
in
all
about
men
this
was
ample
for
the
holding
down
of
the
southern
parts
of
the
kingdom
of
leon
or
even
for
the
attack
on
almeida
and
rodrigo
but
it
was
a
small
force
with
which
to
advance
into
the
mountains
of
central
portugal
or
to
seize
abrantes
if
he
had
carried
out
his
instructions
lapisse
would
have
had
to
march
for
nearly
miles
through
difficult
mountain
country
beset
every
day
by
the
as
soult
had
been
in
his
shorter
route
from
orense
to
oporto
and
if
he
had
ever
cut
his
way
to
abrantes
he
ought
to
have
found
himself
faced
by
cradock
s
british
troops
and
by
the
reorganized
portuguese
regular
army
which
lay
in
and
about
lisbon
with
a
strength
which
even
in
february
was
not
less
than
men
see
on
the
force
was
sous
les
infantry
about
cavalry
and
gunners
napoleon
had
given
lapisse
too
much
to
do
but
on
the
other
hand
that
general
performed
far
too
little
though
he
could
never
have
reached
abrantes
he
ought
to
have
reached
almeida
where
his
presence
would
have
been
of
material
assistance
to
soult
more
especially
if
he
had
from
thence
pushed
exploring
columns
towards
lamego
and
vizeu
before
plunging
into
the
mountains
on
the
road
to
the
south
as
a
matter
of
fact
lapisse
in
february
and
march
never
advanced
so
much
as
fifty
miles
from
salamanca
and
allowed
himself
to
be
contained
and
baffled
for
two
whole
months
by
an
insignificant
opposing
force
commanded
by
a
general
possessing
that
enterprise
and
initiative
which
he
himself
entirely
lacked
the
officer
who
wrecked
this
part
of
napoleon
s
plan
for
the
invasion
of
portugal
was
sir
robert
wilson
one
of
the
most
active
and
capable
men
in
the
english
army
and
one
who
might
have
made
a
great
name
for
himself
had
fortune
been
propitious
but
though
he
served
with
distinction
throughout
the
napoleonic
war
and
won
golden
opinions
in
belgium
and
egypt
in
prussia
and
poland
no
less
than
in
spain
he
never
obtained
that
command
on
a
large
scale
which
would
have
enabled
him
to
show
his
full
powers
it
may
seem
singular
that
a
man
who
won
love
and
admiration
wherever
he
went
who
was
decorated
by
two
emperors
for
brilliant
feats
of
arms
done
under
their
eyes
who
was
equally
popular
in
the
russian
the
austrian
or
the
portuguese
camp
who
had
displayed
on
a
hundred
fields
his
chivalrous
daring
his
ready
ingenuity
and
his
keen
military
insight
should
fail
to
achieve
greatness
but
wilson
unhappily
for
himself
had
the
defects
of
his
qualities
when
acting
as
a
subordinate
his
independent
and
character
was
always
getting
him
into
trouble
with
his
hierarchical
superiors
he
was
not
the
man
to
obey
orders
which
he
believed
to
be
dangerous
or
mistaken
he
so
frequently
thought
for
himself
and
carried
out
plans
quite
different
from
those
which
had
been
imposed
upon
him
that
no
could
tolerate
him
for
long
his
moves
were
always
clever
and
generally
fortunate
but
mere
success
did
not
atone
for
his
disobedience
in
the
eyes
of
his
various
chiefs
and
he
never
remained
for
long
in
the
same
post
all
generals
good
and
bad
agree
in
disliking
lieutenants
who
disregard
their
orders
and
carry
out
other
schemes
even
if
they
be
ingenious
and
successful
ones
it
must
be
added
that
wilson
dabbled
in
politics
on
the
whig
side
and
was
not
a
favourite
with
lord
castlereagh
a
drawback
when
preferments
were
being
distributed
wellington
writes
to
him
on
august
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
instruct
you
when
every
letter
that
i
receive
from
you
informs
me
that
you
have
gone
further
off
and
are
executing
some
plan
of
your
but
when
trusted
with
any
independent
command
and
allowed
a
free
hand
wilson
always
did
well
not
only
had
he
all
the
talents
of
an
excellent
partisan
chief
but
he
was
one
of
those
genial
leaders
who
have
the
power
to
inspire
confidence
and
enthusiasm
in
their
followers
and
are
able
to
get
out
of
them
double
the
work
that
an
ordinary
commander
can
extort
he
was
in
short
one
of
those
men
who
if
left
to
themselves
achieve
great
things
but
who
when
placed
in
a
subordinate
position
quarrel
with
their
superiors
and
get
sent
home
in
disgrace
from
the
moment
when
beresford
assumed
command
of
the
portuguese
army
his
relations
with
wilson
were
one
long
story
of
friction
and
controversy
and
wellesley
though
acknowledging
his
brilliant
services
made
no
attempt
to
keep
him
in
the
peninsula
he
wanted
officers
who
would
obey
orders
even
when
they
did
not
understand
or
approve
them
and
would
not
tolerate
lieutenants
who
wished
to
argue
with
him
it
is
most
unfortunate
that
while
wilson
wrote
and
published
admirable
narratives
of
his
doings
in
prussia
and
poland
in
and
of
his
russian
and
german
campaign
of
he
has
left
nothing
on
record
concerning
portugal
in
moreover
the
life
by
his
breaks
off
in
and
was
never
finished
my
narrative
is
constructed
from
his
dispatches
in
the
record
office
the
correspondence
of
wellesley
and
beresford
and
mayne
and
lillie
s
lusitanian
it
was
wilson
who
first
showed
that
the
new
levies
of
portugal
could
do
good
service
in
the
field
while
silveira
and
eben
were
meeting
with
nothing
but
disaster
in
the
and
the
he
was
conducting
a
thoroughly
successful
campaign
on
the
borders
of
leon
from
january
to
april
he
and
he
alone
protected
the
eastern
frontier
of
portugal
and
with
a
mere
handful
of
men
kept
the
enemy
at
a
distance
and
finally
induced
him
to
draw
off
and
leave
salamanca
just
at
the
moment
when
soult
s
operations
on
the
douro
were
becoming
most
dangerous
the
force
at
his
disposal
in
january
consisted
of
nothing
more
than
his
own
celebrated
loyal
lusitanian
we
have
already
had
occasion
to
mention
this
corps
while
speaking
of
the
reorganization
of
the
portuguese
army
see
page
on
december
as
we
have
seen
he
had
led
out
his
little
brigade
of
towards
the
frontier
it
will
he
remembered
that
it
was
only
the
first
division
of
the
legion
that
marched
the
second
which
could
not
go
forward
for
want
of
uniforms
and
arms
was
left
behind
in
charge
of
baron
eben
that
officer
had
strict
orders
to
move
out
to
almeida
the
moment
that
he
should
receive
the
muskets
that
were
on
their
way
from
england
eben
however
disregarded
his
instructions
became
one
of
the
bishop
s
clique
and
involved
his
men
in
the
campaign
against
soult
thereby
marring
wilson
s
plans
and
depriving
him
of
half
his
proper
force
wilson
s
reasons
for
moving
forward
were
partly
political
partly
military
on
the
one
hand
he
wished
to
get
away
from
the
neighbourhood
of
the
bishop
of
oporto
whose
intrigues
disgusted
him
on
the
other
he
saw
that
it
was
necessary
to
bring
up
a
force
to
cover
the
frontier
of
portugal
when
moore
marched
forward
into
spain
as
long
as
moore
had
remained
at
salamanca
there
was
a
strong
barrier
in
front
of
portugal
but
when
he
departed
it
was
clear
that
the
kingdom
must
defend
itself
wilson
therefore
advanced
to
pinhel
near
almeida
and
there
established
his
little
force
in
cantonments
he
was
at
this
place
when
the
startling
developments
of
the
campaign
in
the
last
ten
days
of
december
took
place
moore
retired
on
galicia
napoleon
s
army
swept
on
into
leon
and
wilson
found
himself
left
alone
with
the
whole
defence
of
the
frontier
of
portugal
thrown
on
his
hands
he
soon
heard
of
the
storming
of
zamora
and
toro
and
learnt
that
lapisse
s
division
had
arrived
at
salamanca
three
marches
might
bring
that
general
to
the
border
a
few
days
later
wilson
received
from
sir
john
cradock
the
news
that
he
had
ordered
the
british
garrison
to
evacuate
almeida
and
to
retire
on
lisbon
as
the
whole
remaining
force
in
portugal
would
probably
have
to
embark
in
a
few
days
the
new
added
that
he
should
advise
wilson
to
bring
off
his
british
officers
and
depart
with
the
rest
as
the
portuguese
would
be
unable
to
make
any
head
against
bonaparte
and
it
would
be
a
useless
sacrifice
to
linger
in
their
company
and
be
overwhelmed
this
pusillanimous
counsel
shocked
and
disgusted
wilson
he
called
together
his
subordinates
and
found
that
they
agreed
with
him
in
considering
cradock
s
advice
disgraceful
they
resolved
that
they
could
not
desert
their
portuguese
comrades
and
were
in
honour
bound
to
see
the
campaign
to
an
end
however
black
the
present
outlook
might
appear
it
consisted
of
the
and
regiments
napier
who
is
very
friendly
to
cradock
makes
no
mention
of
this
extraordinary
dispatch
but
it
is
fully
substantiated
by
mayne
and
lillie
who
were
both
present
at
wilson
s
council
of
war
and
heard
the
matter
discussed
see
their
of
the
lusitanian
when
therefore
the
british
garrison
of
almeida
was
withdrawn
wilson
entered
that
fortress
with
the
legion
and
took
charge
of
it
he
obtained
from
the
regency
leave
to
appoint
his
william
mayne
as
the
governor
and
also
received
permission
to
assume
command
of
the
local
levies
in
the
neighbourhood
these
consisted
of
the
skeletons
of
two
line
regiments
nos
and
whose
reorganization
had
but
just
begun
there
were
also
two
militia
regiments
guarda
and
trancoso
to
be
raised
in
the
district
but
at
this
moment
they
existed
only
in
name
and
possessed
neither
officers
nor
arms
for
immediate
action
wilson
could
count
upon
nothing
but
the
men
of
the
lusitanian
legion
nevertheless
he
resolved
to
advance
at
once
and
to
endeavour
to
impose
on
lapisse
by
a
show
of
activity
leaving
the
portuguese
regulars
and
men
of
the
legion
to
garrison
almeida
he
crossed
the
frontier
with
his
handful
of
cavalry
not
sabres
two
guns
and
men
of
his
light
companies
passing
the
spanish
fortress
of
ciudad
rodrigo
he
advanced
some
distance
on
the
salamanca
road
and
took
up
his
position
behind
the
yeltes
river
with
his
right
resting
on
the
inaccessible
sierra
de
francia
and
his
left
at
san
felices
half
way
to
the
douro
his
whole
force
constituted
no
more
than
a
thin
line
of
pickets
but
he
acted
with
such
confidence
and
decision
beating
up
the
french
outposts
with
his
dragoons
raiding
well
forward
in
the
direction
of
ledesma
and
tamames
and
stirring
up
the
peasants
of
the
mountain
country
to
insurrection
that
lapisse
gave
him
credit
for
having
a
considerable
force
at
his
back
the
french
general
had
expected
to
meet
with
no
opposition
on
his
way
to
almeida
believing
that
cradock
was
about
to
embark
and
that
the
portuguese
would
not
fight
he
was
accordingly
much
surprised
to
find
a
long
line
in
his
front
occupied
by
troops
dressed
like
british
riflemen
and
commanded
by
british
officers
whose
strength
he
was
unable
to
ascertain
he
halted
in
order
to
take
stock
of
his
opponent
when
a
bold
push
would
have
shown
him
that
only
a
skeleton
army
was
before
him
in
an
intercepted
dispatch
of
february
he
reported
that
the
peasantry
informed
him
that
wilson
had
men
and
that
as
many
more
were
in
garrison
at
ciudad
rodrigo
and
almeida
see
the
as
the
weeks
wore
on
and
the
winter
drew
to
an
end
wilson
obtained
some
slight
reinforcements
when
he
first
advanced
the
spaniards
could
give
him
no
help
for
the
garrison
of
ciudad
rodrigo
itself
consisted
of
nothing
but
its
six
companies
of
urban
militia
and
a
new
battalion
of
men
which
had
been
on
the
point
of
setting
out
to
join
la
romana
when
its
way
to
leon
was
intercepted
by
the
french
there
were
men
to
man
a
fortress
which
required
a
garrison
of
but
before
january
was
out
pignatelli
the
of
castile
had
sent
into
the
place
a
regiment
which
he
had
raised
in
the
mountains
of
avila
and
carlos
d
españa
had
begun
to
form
some
new
battalions
from
the
peasantry
of
the
ciudad
rodrigo
district
stiffened
by
stragglers
from
la
romana
s
army
in
february
the
central
junta
gave
wilson
a
provisional
command
over
the
spanish
forces
in
leon
and
he
used
his
authority
to
draw
upon
the
garrison
of
rodrigo
for
detachments
to
strengthen
his
outposts
he
also
requisitioned
men
from
almeida
when
the
portuguese
regiments
there
placed
had
begun
to
fill
up
their
ranks
to
a
respectable
strength
a
few
cavalry
of
the
of
the
line
were
especially
useful
to
him
for
scouting
work
this
fact
comes
from
a
letter
of
ramon
blanco
governor
of
ciudad
rodrigo
dated
which
frere
sent
home
to
castlereagh
and
which
is
therefore
now
in
the
record
office
blanco
complains
that
he
is
absolutely
without
trained
artillerymen
of
any
sort
carlos
d
españa
whose
name
we
shall
so
frequently
meet
during
the
succeeding
years
was
no
spaniard
but
a
french
officer
of
the
name
of
d
espagne
englishmen
on
account
of
his
name
sometimes
took
him
for
a
prince
of
the
spanish
royal
family
sir
robert
wilson
to
frere
dated
in
the
record
office
the
regiment
sent
by
pignatelli
was
called
volunteers
of
with
this
small
assistance
wilson
whose
total
force
never
exceeded
horse
and
infantry
kept
lapisse
employed
throughout
february
and
march
he
beat
up
the
french
quarters
on
several
occasions
and
twice
captured
large
convoys
of
provisions
which
were
being
directed
on
salamanca
to
fall
upon
one
of
these
a
great
requisition
of
foodstuffs
from
ledesma
he
dashed
far
within
lapisse
s
lines
but
brought
out
all
the
wagons
in
safety
and
delivered
them
to
the
governor
of
ciudad
rodrigo
at
last
emboldened
by
his
adversary
s
timidity
he
extended
his
right
beyond
the
sierra
de
francia
and
established
part
of
the
legion
under
colonel
mayne
in
the
puerto
de
baños
the
main
pass
between
salamanca
and
estremadura
thus
lapisse
was
completely
cut
off
from
all
communication
with
victor
and
the
french
army
on
the
tagus
save
by
the
circuitous
route
through
madrid
jourdan
writing
in
the
name
of
king
joseph
had
duly
transmitted
to
lapisse
the
emperor
s
orders
to
march
on
abrantes
the
moment
that
it
should
be
known
that
soult
had
arrived
at
oporto
he
had
even
reiterated
these
directions
in
february
though
both
he
and
the
king
doubted
their
wisdom
victor
had
written
to
madrid
to
suggest
that
alcantara
would
be
a
much
better
and
safer
objective
for
the
division
to
aim
at
than
abrantes
he
wished
to
draw
lapisse
s
troops
which
properly
belonged
to
the
corps
into
his
own
sphere
of
operations
and
repeatedly
declared
that
without
them
he
had
no
hope
of
bringing
his
estremaduran
campaign
to
a
happy
end
much
less
of
executing
any
effective
diversion
against
portugal
jourdan
agreed
with
him
opining
that
lapisse
would
miscarry
if
he
invaded
central
portugal
on
an
independent
line
of
operations
but
no
one
was
so
convinced
of
this
as
lapisse
himself
who
with
his
exaggerated
ideas
of
the
strength
of
wilson
was
most
reluctant
to
move
forward
as
late
as
the
end
of
march
the
emperor
s
orders
were
still
ostensibly
in
vigour
and
the
general
only
excused
himself
for
not
marching
by
pretending
that
he
could
not
venture
to
advance
till
he
had
certain
news
of
soult
s
movements
this
the
galician
insurgents
were
obliging
enough
to
keep
from
him
victor
to
king
joseph
from
toledo
this
is
shown
by
a
letter
of
march
from
solignac
one
of
lapisse
s
brigadiers
which
was
intercepted
by
guerrillas
the
general
writes
to
his
friend
raguerie
that
the
march
on
abrantes
is
certain
and
that
letters
for
him
had
better
be
readdressed
to
lisbon
record
office
at
last
however
jourdan
yielded
to
victor
s
wishes
and
authorized
lapisse
to
drop
down
on
to
alcantara
keeping
outside
the
limits
of
portugal
instead
of
making
the
attack
on
rodrigo
and
the
subsequent
dash
at
abrantes
which
the
emperor
had
prescribed
overjoyed
at
escaping
from
the
responsibility
which
he
dreaded
lapisse
first
prepared
to
march
southward
by
the
puerto
de
baños
but
when
he
found
it
held
by
mayne
and
the
troops
of
wilson
s
right
wing
he
made
no
attempt
to
force
the
passage
but
resolved
to
carry
out
his
design
by
stratagem
massing
his
division
he
marched
on
ciudad
rodrigo
upon
april
he
pierced
with
ease
the
feeble
screen
of
wilson
s
outposts
and
appeared
in
front
of
the
spanish
fortress
which
he
duly
summoned
to
surrender
but
though
the
place
might
easily
have
been
carried
by
a
de
in
january
it
was
now
safe
against
anything
but
a
formal
siege
and
lapisse
had
neither
a
nor
any
real
intention
of
attacking
when
the
governor
returned
a
defiant
answer
the
french
division
made
a
show
of
sitting
down
in
front
of
the
walls
this
was
done
in
order
to
draw
wilson
to
the
aid
of
the
place
and
the
move
was
successful
calling
in
all
his
outlying
detachments
from
the
nearer
passes
and
collecting
some
of
carlos
d
españa
s
levies
sir
robert
took
post
close
to
the
walls
of
ciudad
rodrigo
with
a
battalion
of
the
legion
under
colonel
grant
some
other
portuguese
troops
and
four
guns
jourdan
s
show
that
he
and
joseph
authorized
the
move
at
victor
s
instance
and
prove
that
it
was
not
made
on
lapisse
s
own
responsibility
as
napier
supposes
ii
but
in
obedience
to
superior
orders
this
narrative
is
from
mayne
and
lillie
supplemented
by
jourdan
and
other
french
sources
wilson
thought
that
he
had
foiled
a
real
attack
on
rodrigo
but
was
mistaken
lapisse
was
only
feinting
having
thus
lured
wilson
away
from
the
passes
the
french
general
suddenly
broke
up
by
night
and
made
a
forced
march
for
the
puerto
de
perales
the
nearest
to
alcantara
he
thus
obtained
a
full
day
s
start
and
got
off
unmolested
sir
robert
and
carlos
d
españa
followed
on
his
track
as
soon
as
they
discovered
his
departure
and
mayne
also
pursued
from
the
puerto
de
baños
but
none
of
them
could
do
more
than
harass
his
rearguard
with
which
they
skirmished
for
three
days
in
the
passes
it
would
not
have
been
wise
of
them
to
attempt
more
even
if
they
could
have
got
into
touch
with
the
main
body
for
the
french
division
was
double
their
strength
meanwhile
the
peasantry
of
the
sierra
de
gata
endeavoured
to
stop
lapisse
s
progress
by
blocking
the
defiles
but
he
swept
them
away
with
ease
and
they
never
succeeded
in
delaying
him
for
more
than
a
few
hours
their
incessant
sniping
and
night
attacks
exasperated
the
french
who
dealt
most
ruthlessly
with
the
as
they
passed
when
they
arrived
at
alcantara
and
found
the
little
town
barricaded
they
not
only
refused
all
quarter
to
the
when
they
stormed
the
place
but
committed
dreadful
atrocities
on
the
not
only
murder
and
rape
but
mutilation
and
torture
are
reported
by
credible
witnesses
after
the
houses
had
been
sacked
the
very
tombs
in
the
churches
were
broken
open
in
search
of
plunder
leaving
alcantara
full
of
corpses
and
ruins
april
the
division
marched
on
by
caceres
and
joined
victor
in
his
camp
near
merida
april
it
is
impossible
to
make
out
why
alcantara
was
treated
so
much
worse
than
other
places
taken
by
storm
but
the
facts
are
well
vouched
for
the
report
of
the
local
authorities
to
cuesta
says
that
not
only
all
peasants
taken
with
arms
in
their
hands
but
more
than
forty
were
butchered
and
that
not
a
woman
who
had
remained
in
the
place
escaped
rape
lillie
the
historian
of
the
lusitanian
legion
who
was
with
the
force
that
pursued
lapisse
from
rodrigo
says
that
he
saw
the
traces
of
acts
of
barbarity
that
would
disgrace
the
most
savage
and
uncivilized
of
mankind
corpses
deliberately
mutilated
and
laid
out
to
roast
on
piles
of
burning
furniture
with
the
bodies
of
domestic
animals
such
as
pigs
and
dogs
placed
on
the
top
of
the
pile
as
if
in
jest
pp
the
german
historian
schepeler
gives
very
similar
details
adding
the
note
about
the
dragging
up
of
bones
and
coffins
from
the
churches
all
napier
s
criticism
ii
on
lapisse
s
movement
to
alcantara
is
vitiated
by
his
ignorance
of
the
fact
that
jourdan
and
the
king
at
victor
s
instance
had
sent
him
orders
to
go
there
but
nothing
can
excuse
his
previous
inaction
in
february
and
march
he
ought
to
have
attacked
rodrigo
before
the
end
of
january
when
it
was
still
almost
without
a
garrison
and
in
a
state
of
great
disrepair
since
lapisse
then
had
moved
off
far
to
the
south
and
thrown
in
his
lot
with
his
old
comrades
of
the
corps
it
was
in
vain
that
soult
sought
for
news
of
him
on
the
douro
after
the
fall
of
oporto
when
loison
set
out
to
cross
the
tamega
and
to
enter
the
in
order
that
he
might
obtain
information
of
the
movements
of
the
division
at
salamanca
that
division
was
making
ready
for
its
march
to
alcantara
a
fortnight
later
it
had
disappeared
from
the
northern
theatre
of
operations
altogether
and
soult
s
last
chance
of
obtaining
external
help
for
his
invasion
of
portugal
was
gone
this
section
in
short
of
napoleon
s
great
plan
for
the
march
on
lisbon
had
been
foiled
and
foiled
almost
entirely
by
sir
robert
wilson
s
happy
audacity
and
resourceful
generalship
but
for
him
the
timidity
of
cradock
the
impotence
of
the
spaniards
and
the
disorganization
of
the
portuguese
army
might
have
brought
about
the
fall
of
ciudad
rodrigo
and
almeida
at
the
same
moment
that
soult
was
entering
portugal
on
its
northern
frontier
his
services
have
never
received
their
proper
meed
of
praise
either
from
the
government
which
he
served
so
well
or
from
the
historians
who
have
told
the
annals
of
the
peninsular
war
we
must
now
return
to
the
details
of
the
duke
of
dalmatia
s
operations
his
movements
were
clearly
dependent
on
the
results
of
the
two
expeditions
under
heudelet
and
loison
which
he
had
sent
out
to
the
north
and
the
east
after
his
victory
of
march
heudelet
after
discharging
on
to
oporto
the
sick
and
wounded
and
the
stores
which
he
had
been
guarding
at
braga
started
out
northward
on
april
with
the
infantry
of
his
own
division
and
lorges
dragoons
whom
the
marshal
had
ordered
up
to
his
aid
from
villa
de
conde
heudelet
was
ordered
to
disperse
the
insurgents
in
the
valleys
of
the
lima
and
minho
and
to
relieve
tuy
and
vigo
where
the
french
garrisons
were
known
to
be
in
a
state
of
siege
to
reach
them
it
was
necessary
to
pierce
through
the
screen
of
militia
and
under
general
botilho
which
had
cut
off
all
communication
between
galicia
and
the
army
of
portugal
since
the
month
of
february
on
april
the
french
general
neared
the
line
of
the
lima
only
to
find
the
bridges
barricaded
and
botilho
s
horde
entrenched
behind
them
after
some
preliminary
skirmishing
fords
were
discovered
which
heudelet
s
infantry
passed
upon
the
following
morning
sending
the
unfortunate
portuguese
flying
in
every
direction
and
capturing
the
three
guns
which
formed
their
sole
artillery
on
the
tenth
the
frontier
fortress
of
valenza
was
reached
it
was
found
to
be
in
a
dilapidated
condition
and
garrisoned
by
only
men
who
surrendered
at
the
first
summons
tuy
where
general
lamartinière
had
been
shut
up
for
the
last
seven
weeks
faces
valenza
across
the
broad
estuary
of
the
minho
so
that
heudelet
was
now
in
full
communication
with
it
lamartinière
as
it
will
be
remembered
had
been
left
behind
with
soult
s
heavy
artillery
wheeled
transport
and
sick
when
the
corps
marched
for
orense
on
february
he
had
gathered
in
several
belated
detachments
which
had
started
from
santiago
in
the
hope
of
joining
the
rear
of
the
marching
column
so
that
he
had
the
respectable
force
of
men
though
of
them
were
invalids
or
convalescents
the
walls
of
tuy
were
in
a
bad
state
of
repair
but
the
governor
had
found
no
great
difficulty
in
maintaining
himself
against
the
galician
insurgents
on
his
own
side
of
the
minho
and
the
portuguese
levies
from
the
other
bank
which
botilho
sent
to
the
aid
of
the
spaniards
but
he
had
been
completely
shut
in
since
soult
s
departure
and
could
give
no
information
concerning
ney
s
operations
in
northern
galicia
or
the
general
progress
of
the
war
in
the
other
parts
of
spain
the
only
news
which
he
could
supply
was
that
vigo
the
next
french
garrison
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
on
his
way
to
portugal
soult
had
dropped
a
force
of
men
at
that
fortress
lest
its
excellent
harbour
should
be
utilized
by
the
british
for
throwing
in
supplies
to
the
galician
insurgents
the
of
the
corps
with
his
treasure
and
its
escort
had
lagged
behind
during
the
marshal
s
advance
and
being
beset
by
the
peasantry
had
entered
vigo
instead
of
pushing
on
to
tuy
see
when
soult
had
passed
out
of
sight
on
the
way
to
orense
the
galicians
of
the
headed
by
pablo
morillo
a
lieutenant
of
the
regular
army
whom
la
romana
had
sent
down
from
the
interior
and
by
manuel
garcia
del
barrio
a
colonel
dispatched
by
the
central
junta
from
seville
had
taken
arms
in
great
numbers
and
blockaded
vigo
the
french
commander
colonel
chalot
found
himself
unable
to
defend
the
whole
extent
of
the
fortifications
for
sheer
want
of
men
and
could
not
prevent
the
insurgents
from
establishing
themselves
close
under
the
walls
and
keeping
up
a
continual
fire
upon
the
garrison
he
believed
that
a
serious
assault
would
infallibly
succeed
and
only
refused
to
surrender
because
he
was
ashamed
to
yield
to
peasants
on
march
two
english
frigates
the
and
appeared
off
the
harbour
mouth
and
began
to
supply
the
insurgents
with
ammunition
and
to
land
heavy
naval
guns
for
their
use
on
the
one
of
the
gates
was
battered
in
and
the
galicians
were
preparing
to
storm
the
place
when
chalot
surrendered
at
discretion
only
stipulating
that
he
and
his
men
should
be
handed
over
to
the
british
and
not
to
the
spaniards
this
request
was
granted
and
captain
mackinley
received
officers
and
nearly
men
as
prisoners
besides
a
number
of
sick
and
several
hundred
belonging
to
the
train
and
the
plunder
taken
consisted
of
sixty
wagons
horses
and
more
than
in
hard
cash
composing
the
military
chest
of
the
corps
march
napier
s
colonel
the
galicians
had
somewhat
relaxed
the
blockade
of
tuy
in
order
to
press
that
of
vigo
and
on
the
very
day
when
chalot
surrendered
general
lamartinière
had
sent
out
a
flying
column
to
endeavour
to
communicate
with
his
colleague
it
returned
pursued
by
the
spaniards
to
report
to
the
governor
that
vigo
had
fallen
on
its
way
back
to
tuy
it
suffered
a
loss
of
seventy
prisoners
and
nearly
killed
and
wounded
most
of
these
details
as
to
the
fall
of
vigo
come
from
a
contemporary
account
in
andrade
s
collection
printed
in
guerrilleros
pp
le
noble
asserts
that
only
men
were
captured
but
captain
mackinley
says
that
he
received
nearly
prisoners
including
sick
and
many
he
had
the
best
opportunities
of
knowing
and
must
be
followed
le
noble
and
the
spaniards
do
not
give
the
french
commander
s
name
but
i
find
that
of
chalot
as
the
senior
officer
among
the
prisoners
in
the
list
in
the
record
office
next
to
him
is
the
conscience
toreno
and
schepeler
agree
with
captain
mackinley
in
giving
the
number
of
the
prisoners
at
over
heudelet
and
lamartinière
had
now
some
men
collected
at
tuy
a
force
with
which
they
could
easily
have
routed
the
whole
of
the
insurgents
of
the
minho
and
forced
them
to
retire
into
the
mountains
but
soult
s
orders
to
his
lieutenants
were
to
avoid
operations
in
galicia
and
to
concentrate
towards
portugal
tuy
was
evacuated
and
its
garrison
transferred
across
the
to
the
portuguese
fortress
of
valenza
before
the
transference
was
completed
the
french
generals
received
an
unexpected
visit
from
some
troops
of
the
corps
ney
disquieted
as
to
the
condition
of
tuy
and
vigo
had
sent
a
brigade
under
maucune
to
seek
for
news
of
their
garrisons
this
force
cutting
its
way
through
the
insurgents
came
into
tuy
on
april
thus
heudelet
was
at
last
able
to
get
news
of
the
operations
of
ney
the
information
received
was
not
encouraging
the
duke
of
elchingen
was
beset
by
the
galicians
on
every
side
la
romana
had
cut
off
one
of
his
outlying
garrisons
that
of
villafranca
and
his
communications
with
leon
were
so
completely
cut
off
that
he
had
no
reports
to
give
as
to
the
progress
of
affairs
in
the
rest
of
spain
finding
that
vigo
was
lost
and
the
garrison
of
tuy
relieved
maucune
retraced
his
steps
and
returned
to
santiago
harassed
for
the
whole
of
his
march
by
the
insurgents
of
the
meanwhile
heudelet
s
communication
with
oporto
had
been
interrupted
for
the
portuguese
routed
on
the
lima
a
week
before
had
come
back
to
their
old
haunts
seized
braga
and
blocked
the
and
the
bridges
soult
only
got
into
touch
with
his
expeditionary
force
by
sending
out
lahoussaye
with
men
to
reopen
the
road
to
the
north
when
this
was
done
he
bade
heudelet
evacuate
valenza
whose
fortifications
turned
out
to
be
in
too
bad
order
to
be
repaired
in
any
reasonable
space
of
time
and
to
disperse
his
division
in
garrisons
for
braga
viana
and
barcelos
the
whole
of
the
convoy
and
the
sick
from
tuy
were
sent
up
to
oporto
the
net
result
of
heudelet
s
operations
was
that
the
marshal
at
the
cost
of
immobilizing
one
of
his
four
infantry
divisions
obtained
a
somewhat
precarious
hold
upon
the
flat
country
of
the
towns
were
in
his
hands
but
the
had
only
retired
to
the
hills
and
perpetually
descended
to
worry
heudelet
s
detachments
and
to
murder
couriers
and
foraging
parties
meanwhile
men
were
wasted
for
all
purposes
of
offensive
action
vigo
tuy
and
valenza
had
all
been
abandoned
and
touch
with
the
army
of
galicia
had
been
completely
lost
even
this
modest
amount
of
success
had
been
denied
to
soult
s
second
expedition
that
which
he
had
sent
under
loison
towards
the
the
enemy
with
whom
the
french
had
to
deal
in
this
region
was
silveira
the
same
officer
who
had
been
defeated
between
monterey
and
chaves
in
the
early
days
of
march
when
the
corps
crossed
the
portuguese
frontier
he
had
fled
with
the
wrecks
of
his
force
towards
villa
real
at
the
moment
when
soult
marched
on
braga
and
the
marshal
had
fondly
hoped
that
he
was
now
a
negligible
quantity
in
the
campaign
this
was
far
from
being
the
case
the
moment
that
silveira
heard
that
the
french
had
crossed
the
mountains
and
marched
on
braga
he
had
rallied
his
two
regular
regiments
and
his
masses
of
and
pounced
down
on
the
detachment
under
commandant
messager
which
soult
had
left
in
garrison
at
chaves
this
it
will
be
remembered
consisted
of
no
more
than
a
company
of
infantry
a
quantity
of
convalescents
and
stragglers
and
the
untrustworthy
legion
which
had
been
formed
out
of
the
prisoners
captured
on
march
and
on
the
very
day
upon
which
soult
was
routing
eben
in
front
of
braga
silveira
appeared
before
the
walls
of
chaves
with
men
messager
retired
into
the
citadel
abandoning
on
the
outer
walls
of
the
town
a
few
guns
which
the
portuguese
were
thus
enabled
to
turn
against
the
inner
defences
after
a
siege
of
five
days
and
much
ineffective
cannonading
the
governor
surrendered
mainly
because
the
native
legion
was
preparing
to
open
the
gates
to
silveira
twelve
hundred
men
were
captured
of
whom
only
were
frenchmen
capable
of
bearing
arms
the
rest
being
sick
or
le
noble
though
he
mentions
the
formation
of
the
legion
omits
to
state
that
it
was
left
at
chaves
but
chamans
establishes
this
fact
he
calls
the
corps
les
espagnols
et
portugais
qui
se
disaient
de
notre
des
odoards
also
speaks
of
the
legion
as
does
naylies
its
existence
explains
both
the
feebleness
of
messager
s
defence
and
the
large
number
of
prisoners
whom
silveira
captured
the
fighting
force
of
the
garrison
was
only
the
one
company
plus
some
hundreds
of
convalescents
who
in
the
fortnight
since
soult
s
departure
had
been
able
to
resume
their
arms
having
made
this
successful
stroke
silveira
marched
down
the
tamega
to
amarante
making
a
movement
parallel
to
soult
s
advance
on
oporto
his
recapture
of
chaves
brought
several
thousands
more
of
to
his
standard
and
at
amarante
he
was
joined
on
the
thirtieth
by
many
of
the
fugitives
who
had
escaped
from
the
sack
of
oporto
on
the
previous
day
he
spread
his
army
now
amounting
to
or
men
along
the
left
bank
of
the
tamega
whose
bridges
and
fords
he
protected
with
entrenchments
advanced
guards
were
pushed
out
on
the
further
side
of
the
river
on
the
three
roads
which
lead
to
oporto
when
therefore
the
troops
under
loison
which
soult
had
sent
out
towards
the
drew
near
the
tamega
they
found
the
portuguese
in
force
the
cavalry
could
get
no
further
forward
than
penafiel
when
foy
s
infantry
came
up
april
loison
tried
to
force
the
enemy
back
both
on
the
amarante
and
on
the
canavezes
road
he
failed
at
each
point
and
sent
back
to
the
marshal
to
ask
for
reinforcements
seeing
him
halt
silveira
whose
fault
was
not
a
want
of
initiative
actually
crossed
the
river
with
his
whole
army
and
fell
upon
the
two
french
brigades
he
was
checked
but
not
badly
beaten
and
loison
remained
on
the
defensive
april
at
this
moment
soult
heard
of
the
fall
of
chaves
full
seventeen
days
after
it
had
happened
realizing
that
silveira
was
now
growing
formidable
he
sent
to
loison
s
aid
general
delaborde
with
the
second
of
his
infantry
brigades
and
lorges
dragoons
these
reinforcements
brought
the
troops
facing
silveira
up
to
a
total
of
some
men
nearly
a
third
of
soult
s
whole
disposable
force
as
heudelet
was
still
absent
on
the
minho
with
men
more
the
marshal
had
less
than
left
in
and
about
oporto
it
was
clear
that
the
grand
march
on
lisbon
was
not
likely
to
begin
for
many
a
long
day
on
april
loison
advanced
against
silveira
who
boldly
but
unwisely
offered
him
battle
on
the
heights
of
villamea
in
front
of
amarante
considering
that
he
had
but
regulars
and
or
militia
and
his
conduct
can
only
be
described
as
rash
in
the
extreme
he
was
of
course
beaten
with
great
loss
and
hustled
back
into
the
town
of
amarante
he
would
have
lost
both
it
and
its
bridge
but
for
the
gallantry
of
colonel
patrick
an
english
officer
commanding
a
battalion
of
the
of
the
line
who
rallied
his
regiment
in
the
streets
seized
a
group
of
houses
and
a
convent
at
the
and
beat
off
the
pursuers
patrick
was
mortally
wounded
but
the
passage
of
the
river
was
prevented
this
saved
the
situation
silveira
got
his
men
together
planted
his
artillery
so
as
to
command
the
bridge
and
took
post
in
entrenchments
already
constructed
on
the
commanding
heights
on
the
left
bank
next
day
loison
stormed
the
buildings
at
the
but
found
that
he
could
get
no
further
forward
the
town
was
his
but
he
could
not
debouch
from
it
as
the
bridge
was
palisaded
built
up
with
a
barricade
of
masonry
and
raked
by
the
portuguese
artillery
soult
now
sent
up
to
aid
loison
still
further
reinforcements
sarrut
s
brigade
of
infantry
from
merle
s
division
and
the
second
brigade
of
lahoussaye
s
dragoons
thus
no
less
than
french
troops
nearly
half
the
army
of
portugal
were
concentrated
at
amarante
silveira
to
beresford
record
office
cf
foy
s
dispatch
to
loison
april
in
which
he
owns
that
he
failed
to
hold
the
convent
and
retired
with
a
loss
of
men
of
the
regiment
the
fact
that
twelve
whole
days
elapsed
between
the
arrival
of
these
last
succours
and
the
forcing
of
the
passage
of
the
tamega
had
no
small
influence
on
the
fate
of
soult
s
campaign
hitherto
the
initiative
had
lain
with
him
and
he
had
faced
adversaries
who
could
only
take
the
defensive
this
period
was
nearly
at
an
end
for
on
april
wellesley
had
landed
at
lisbon
the
english
reinforcements
had
begun
to
arrive
and
an
army
differing
in
every
quality
from
the
hordes
which
the
marshal
had
encountered
north
of
the
douro
was
about
to
assume
the
offensive
against
him
by
the
time
that
loison
at
last
forced
the
bridge
of
amarante
the
british
were
already
on
the
march
for
coimbra
and
oporto
silveira
and
his
motley
host
therefore
were
doing
admirable
service
to
the
cause
of
their
country
when
they
occupied
out
of
soult
s
men
from
april
to
may
on
the
banks
of
the
tamega
the
ground
was
in
their
favour
but
far
stronger
positions
had
been
forced
ere
now
and
it
was
fortunate
that
this
one
was
maintained
for
so
many
days
the
town
of
amarante
it
must
be
remembered
lies
on
comparatively
low
ground
its
bridge
is
completely
commanded
by
the
heights
on
which
silveira
had
planted
his
camp
and
his
batteries
the
river
flows
in
a
ravine
and
was
at
this
moment
swollen
into
an
impassable
torrent
by
the
melting
of
the
mountain
snows
loison
more
than
once
sent
swimmers
by
night
in
search
of
places
where
the
strength
of
the
current
might
be
sufficiently
moderate
to
allow
of
an
attempt
to
pass
on
rafts
or
boats
not
one
of
these
explorers
could
get
near
the
further
bank
they
were
swept
off
by
the
rushing
water
and
cast
ashore
far
down
stream
on
the
same
side
from
which
they
had
started
there
had
been
bridges
above
amarante
at
mondim
and
aroza
and
below
it
at
canavezes
but
reconnaissances
showed
that
they
had
all
three
been
blown
up
and
that
portuguese
detachments
were
watching
their
ruins
to
prevent
any
attempt
to
reconstruct
them
loison
found
therefore
that
he
could
not
turn
silveira
s
position
by
a
flanking
movement
there
was
nothing
to
do
save
to
wait
till
the
river
should
fall
or
to
attempt
to
force
the
bridge
of
amarante
at
all
costs
continual
rains
made
it
hopeless
to
expect
the
subsidence
of
the
tamega
for
many
days
wherefore
loison
devoted
all
his
energies
to
the
task
of
capturing
the
bridge
even
here
there
was
one
difficulty
to
be
faced
which
might
prove
fatal
the
french
engineers
had
discovered
that
the
structure
was
mined
it
was
necessary
therefore
not
only
to
drive
back
the
portuguese
but
to
prevent
them
from
blowing
up
the
bridge
at
the
moment
of
their
retreat
loison
had
entrusted
the
details
of
the
attack
on
the
bridge
to
delaborde
whose
infantry
held
the
advanced
posts
that
officer
first
tried
to
approach
the
head
of
the
bridge
by
means
of
a
flying
sap
but
when
it
had
advanced
a
certain
distance
the
fire
of
the
portuguese
from
across
the
river
became
so
deadly
that
after
many
men
had
been
killed
in
the
endeavour
to
work
up
to
the
palisades
on
the
bridge
the
attempt
had
to
be
abandoned
the
next
device
recommended
by
the
engineers
was
that
an
attempt
should
be
made
to
lay
a
trestle
bridge
at
a
spot
some
way
below
the
town
where
a
contracted
the
width
of
the
angry
river
this
was
found
to
be
impossible
the
stream
proving
to
be
far
deeper
than
had
been
supposed
while
the
portuguese
from
the
left
bank
picked
off
many
of
the
workmen
april
soult
was
now
growing
vexed
at
the
delay
and
sent
two
guns
of
position
from
oporto
to
loison
to
enable
him
to
subdue
the
fire
of
the
enemy
s
batteries
he
also
offered
to
call
up
heudelet
s
division
from
braga
even
at
the
cost
of
abandoning
his
hold
on
the
northern
part
of
the
province
of
but
a
mere
increase
of
his
already
considerable
force
would
have
been
of
no
service
to
loison
it
was
a
device
for
passing
the
tamega
that
he
needed
such
a
scheme
was
at
last
laid
before
him
by
captain
bouchard
one
of
his
engineers
the
french
officers
had
discovered
by
a
careful
use
of
their
glasses
that
the
portuguese
mine
which
was
to
destroy
the
bridge
was
situated
in
its
arch
and
that
the
mechanism
by
which
it
was
to
be
worked
was
not
a
sausage
or
a
train
of
powder
but
a
loaded
musket
whose
muzzle
was
placed
in
the
mine
while
to
its
trigger
was
attached
a
cord
which
ran
to
the
nearest
trenches
beyond
the
river
the
musket
was
concealed
in
a
box
but
its
cord
was
visible
to
those
provided
with
a
good
telescope
bouchard
argued
that
if
the
cord
could
be
cut
or
broken
the
enemy
would
not
be
able
to
touch
off
the
mine
and
he
had
thought
out
a
plan
for
securing
his
end
he
maintained
that
an
explosion
at
the
french
side
of
the
bridge
would
probably
sever
the
cord
without
firing
the
mine
and
that
a
sudden
assault
made
immediately
after
the
explosion
and
before
the
portuguese
could
recover
themselves
might
carry
the
barricades
in
spite
of
the
doubts
of
foy
and
several
other
generals
bouchard
was
finally
permitted
to
carry
out
his
scheme
napier
ii
pp
consistently
him
brochard
either
of
these
might
easily
have
been
fired
by
a
casual
shot
during
the
long
cannonading
which
had
been
in
progress
the
portuguese
therefore
avoided
them
he
executed
it
on
the
night
of
may
when
a
dense
fog
chanced
to
favour
his
daring
and
hazardous
proceedings
having
first
told
off
some
to
keep
up
a
smart
fire
on
the
enemy
s
trenches
and
distract
his
attention
he
sent
four
sappers
each
provided
with
a
small
on
to
the
bridge
the
men
dressed
in
their
grey
crawled
on
hands
and
knees
each
rolling
his
barrel
which
was
wrapped
in
cloth
to
deaden
the
sound
before
him
they
kept
in
the
shadow
and
getting
close
under
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
crept
on
till
they
reached
the
outermost
portuguese
palisade
one
after
another
at
long
intervals
each
got
forward
unobserved
left
his
barrel
behind
and
crawled
back
the
fourth
sapper
starting
to
his
feet
on
his
return
journey
was
observed
by
the
portuguese
and
shot
down
but
silveira
s
men
did
not
realize
what
he
had
been
doing
and
merely
took
him
for
some
daring
explorer
who
was
endeavouring
to
spy
out
the
state
of
the
defences
after
waiting
for
an
hour
bouchard
sent
out
a
fifth
sapper
who
dragged
behind
him
a
sausage
of
powder
thirty
yards
long
which
he
successfully
connected
with
the
four
barrels
all
was
now
ready
and
a
battalion
of
picked
grenadiers
from
delaborde
s
division
filed
silently
down
into
the
street
near
the
a
whole
brigade
came
behind
them
at
two
o
clock
bouchard
fired
his
sausage
and
the
explosion
followed
there
were
two
chances
of
failure
one
that
the
apparatus
for
firing
the
mine
might
not
be
disturbed
by
the
concussion
the
other
that
the
shock
might
prove
too
strong
reach
the
mine
and
destroy
the
bridge
neither
of
these
fatalities
took
place
the
explosion
duly
broke
the
cord
shattered
the
nearest
palisades
but
did
not
affect
the
mine
before
the
smoke
had
cleared
away
delaborde
s
grenadiers
had
dashed
out
on
to
the
bridge
scrambled
over
the
barricades
and
driven
off
the
guard
on
the
further
side
regiment
after
regiment
followed
them
and
charged
up
the
towards
silveira
s
batteries
and
entrenchments
none
of
the
portuguese
were
under
arms
save
the
few
companies
guarding
the
debouches
from
the
bridge
these
were
swept
away
and
the
french
columns
came
storming
into
the
bivouacs
of
the
enemy
before
he
was
well
awake
hardly
half
a
dozen
cannon
shots
were
fired
on
them
from
the
batteries
and
the
greater
part
of
the
army
of
the
fled
without
firing
a
shot
silveira
escaped
almost
naked
by
the
back
window
of
the
house
above
the
bridge
in
which
he
had
been
sleeping
all
the
ten
guns
in
the
portuguese
batteries
five
standards
and
several
hundred
prisoners
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
victorious
french
who
lost
it
is
said
no
more
than
two
killed
and
seven
wounded
their
good
fortune
had
been
extraordinary
without
the
opportune
fog
which
hid
their
advance
their
preliminary
operations
would
probably
have
been
discovered
if
their
explosion
had
done
a
little
more
or
a
little
less
than
was
hoped
the
bridge
might
have
been
totally
destroyed
or
its
barricades
left
practically
uninjured
either
of
which
chances
would
have
foiled
bouchard
s
plan
but
the
luck
of
the
army
of
portugal
was
still
in
the
ascendant
and
all
went
exactly
as
had
been
intended
thus
the
tamega
was
passed
and
silveira
decisively
beaten
his
levies
had
fled
in
all
directions
and
soult
opined
that
it
would
take
a
long
time
to
rally
them
the
day
after
the
fight
loison
was
joined
at
amarante
by
heudelet
s
division
from
braga
which
in
obedience
to
the
marshal
s
orders
had
marched
to
join
the
expeditionary
force
leaving
only
a
single
battalion
behind
to
hold
viana
this
was
an
unfortunate
move
as
on
heudelet
s
departure
the
came
down
from
the
serra
de
santa
catalina
and
overran
the
district
which
had
been
evacuated
in
spite
of
lorges
dragoons
who
had
been
directed
to
keep
the
roads
clear
after
the
infantry
had
been
withdrawn
meanwhile
there
were
far
more
troops
at
amarante
than
were
needed
for
the
pursuit
of
silveira
so
soult
called
back
to
oporto
the
division
of
delaborde
leaving
to
loison
the
infantry
of
heudelet
and
sarrut
with
lahoussaye
s
two
brigades
of
dragoons
a
force
of
about
men
he
ordered
his
lieutenant
to
scour
the
country
as
far
as
villa
real
and
to
send
reconnaissances
on
the
roads
toward
chaves
and
braganza
with
the
object
of
frightening
the
insurgents
to
retreat
as
far
as
possible
but
loison
was
not
to
advance
for
more
than
two
days
march
into
the
for
rumours
were
beginning
to
arrive
concerning
the
appearance
of
british
troops
in
the
direction
of
coimbra
and
the
marshal
wished
to
keep
his
various
divisions
close
enough
to
each
other
to
enable
them
to
concentrate
with
ease
if
there
were
any
truth
in
the
news
from
the
south
it
would
be
dangerous
to
allow
a
force
which
formed
a
third
of
the
whole
army
of
portugal
to
go
astray
in
the
heart
of
the
mountains
beyond
the
tamega
loison
accordingly
marched
off
on
may
towards
villa
real
which
he
occupied
without
meeting
with
resistance
he
learnt
that
silveira
and
his
regulars
had
crossed
the
douro
and
gone
off
in
the
direction
of
lamego
but
botilho
had
fled
up
the
tamega
towards
chaves
and
the
were
lurking
in
the
hills
he
then
returned
to
amarante
where
we
may
leave
him
at
the
end
of
his
tether
while
we
describe
the
state
of
affairs
in
oporto
section
xiii
chapter
vi
intrigues
at
oporto
the
conspiracy
of
argenton
it
will
have
occurred
to
every
student
of
the
operations
of
the
army
of
portugal
during
the
month
of
april
that
it
was
strange
that
marshal
soult
should
have
remained
quiescent
at
oporto
while
the
fate
of
his
entire
campaign
was
at
stake
during
the
fighting
on
the
tamega
his
head
quarters
were
only
thirty
miles
from
amarante
but
one
day
s
ride
for
himself
and
his
staff
yet
he
never
paid
a
single
flying
visit
to
the
scene
of
operations
even
after
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
loison
was
mismanaging
the
whole
business
he
sent
his
lieutenant
many
letters
of
reproach
forwarded
to
him
guns
of
position
and
ample
reinforcements
but
never
came
himself
to
the
spot
to
urge
on
the
advance
even
when
ten
and
twelve
days
had
elapsed
since
the
first
unsuccessful
attempts
to
force
the
passage
of
the
tamega
the
explanation
of
this
persistent
refusal
of
the
marshal
to
quit
oporto
is
to
be
found
in
the
political
not
the
military
state
of
affairs
at
chaves
he
had
proclaimed
himself
viceroy
of
portugal
his
viceroyalty
at
that
moment
embraced
only
just
so
much
soil
as
was
covered
by
the
encampments
of
his
battalions
but
after
the
capture
of
oporto
and
the
occupation
of
the
neighbouring
towns
of
the
his
position
assumed
an
air
of
reality
and
he
himself
allowed
the
duties
of
the
viceroy
to
trespass
on
those
of
the
commander
of
the
second
corps
d
armée
nay
more
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
that
he
was
not
merely
dreaming
of
setting
up
a
stable
government
in
northern
portugal
but
of
something
else
the
evidence
as
to
his
intentions
is
hard
to
weigh
for
most
of
it
comes
from
the
letters
and
diaries
of
men
who
disliked
him
but
there
are
certain
facts
which
can
not
be
disguised
and
the
inference
from
them
is
irresistible
with
the
example
of
murat
s
exaltation
before
them
the
more
ambitious
and
capable
of
napoleon
s
marshals
could
not
refrain
from
dreaming
of
crowns
and
sceptres
nothing
seemed
impossible
in
those
astounding
days
when
the
emperor
was
creating
sovereigns
and
realms
by
a
stroke
of
the
pen
whenever
the
notion
seized
him
the
line
between
an
appanaged
duke
and
a
vassal
prince
was
a
very
thin
one
as
the
case
of
berthier
shows
junot
had
dreamed
of
royalty
at
lisbon
in
and
there
seems
little
doubt
that
the
same
mirage
of
a
crown
floated
before
soult
s
eyes
at
oporto
in
the
city
itself
suggested
the
idea
in
the
treaty
of
fontainebleau
napoleon
had
put
on
paper
the
project
for
creating
a
king
of
northern
lusitania
with
oporto
as
his
capital
and
the
as
his
realm
soult
was
cautious
and
wary
but
he
was
also
greedy
and
ambitious
if
on
the
one
hand
he
had
a
wholesome
fear
of
his
master
he
had
on
the
other
good
reasons
for
believing
that
it
might
be
possible
to
force
his
hand
by
presenting
him
with
a
there
was
in
the
city
the
nucleus
of
a
party
which
was
not
wholly
indisposed
to
submit
to
the
french
domination
it
was
mainly
composed
of
those
enemies
of
the
bishop
of
oporto
who
had
been
suffering
from
his
anarchical
rule
of
the
last
two
months
they
were
the
friends
and
relatives
of
those
who
had
perished
by
the
dagger
or
the
rope
during
the
which
had
prevailed
ever
since
dom
antonio
returned
from
lisbon
to
these
may
be
added
some
men
of
purely
material
interests
who
saw
that
the
insurrection
was
ruining
them
and
a
remnant
of
the
old
corrupt
bureaucracy
which
had
submitted
once
before
to
junot
whose
only
thought
was
to
keep
or
gain
profitable
posts
under
the
government
of
the
day
whatever
that
government
might
be
the
whole
body
of
dissidents
from
the
cause
of
patriotism
and
independence
was
so
small
and
weak
that
it
is
impossible
to
believe
that
they
would
have
taken
any
overt
action
if
they
had
not
received
encouragement
from
soult
this
much
is
certain
that
when
the
disorders
which
accompanied
the
capture
of
oporto
were
ended
soult
showed
himself
most
anxious
to
conciliate
the
portuguese
not
only
by
introducing
a
regular
and
orderly
government
but
by
going
out
of
his
way
to
soothe
and
flatter
any
notable
who
lingered
in
the
city
in
his
anxiety
to
win
over
the
clergy
he
caused
new
silver
vessels
and
candelabra
to
be
made
to
replace
those
which
had
been
stolen
from
the
churches
in
the
sack
he
filled
up
all
civil
appointments
whose
holders
had
fled
from
the
small
number
of
persons
who
were
ready
to
adhere
to
the
french
he
again
as
already
at
chaves
endeavoured
to
enlist
a
native
military
force
by
putting
tempting
offers
before
those
officers
of
the
regular
army
who
had
been
made
prisoners
all
this
might
have
had
no
other
cause
than
the
wish
to
build
up
a
party
of
such
as
already
existed
in
spain
and
soult
openly
declared
that
such
was
his
object
this
was
the
only
purpose
that
he
avowed
in
his
dispatches
to
the
emperor
and
in
his
communications
with
his
colleagues
see
le
noble
soult
s
partisan
and
official
vindicator
and
fantin
des
odoards
see
his
conversation
with
his
chamans
in
the
latter
s
the
marshal
said
that
he
was
in
a
hazardous
military
position
and
that
je
ne
puis
m
en
tirer
qu
en
divisant
les
portugais
entre
eux
et
j
emploie
pour
cela
le
meilleur
moyen
politique
qui
soit
en
mon
compare
fantin
des
odoards
but
if
the
marshal
had
no
ulterior
object
in
view
it
is
singular
that
all
his
native
partisans
concurred
in
setting
on
foot
a
movement
for
getting
him
saluted
as
king
of
northern
portugal
the
new
municipal
authorities
whom
he
had
established
in
the
towns
occupied
by
his
troops
sent
in
petitions
begging
him
to
assume
the
position
of
sovereign
documents
of
this
kind
came
in
from
braga
barcelos
guimaraens
feira
oliveira
and
villa
de
conde
in
oporto
proclamations
were
posted
on
the
walls
declaring
that
the
prince
regent
by
his
departure
to
brazil
had
formally
resigned
his
crown
and
that
the
only
salvation
for
portugal
would
be
that
the
duke
of
dalmatia
the
most
distinguished
of
the
pupils
of
the
great
napoleon
should
ascend
the
vacant
throne
a
priest
named
veloso
and
other
persons
went
about
in
the
street
delivering
harangues
in
favour
of
the
creation
of
the
kingdom
of
northern
a
register
was
opened
in
the
municipal
buildings
to
be
signed
by
all
persons
who
wished
to
join
in
the
petition
to
the
marshal
to
assume
the
regal
title
and
a
certain
number
of
signatures
were
collected
a
newspaper
called
the
do
was
started
to
support
the
movement
and
ran
for
about
a
month
it
is
said
that
soult
s
partisans
even
succeeded
in
gathering
small
crowds
together
before
the
mansion
where
his
head
quarters
were
established
to
shout
o
rei
nicolao
and
that
the
acclamations
were
acknowledged
by
showers
of
copper
coins
thrown
from
the
windows
the
latter
part
of
this
story
is
no
doubt
an
invention
of
soult
s
enemies
but
it
was
believed
at
the
time
by
the
majority
of
the
french
officers
and
roi
was
for
the
future
his
nickname
in
the
army
of
portugal
on
april
the
marshal
ordered
his
chief
of
the
staff
general
ricard
to
issue
a
circular
letter
to
the
generals
of
divisions
and
brigades
inviting
their
in
the
movement
and
assuring
them
that
no
disloyalty
to
the
emperor
would
be
involved
even
if
the
marshal
assumed
regal
powers
this
document
is
the
most
convincing
piece
of
evidence
that
exists
as
to
soult
s
intentions
in
it
there
is
no
attempt
made
to
conceal
the
movement
that
had
been
set
on
foot
the
writer
s
only
preoccupation
is
to
show
that
it
was
not
directed
against
napoleon
when
five
months
later
ricard
s
circular
came
under
the
emperor
s
eye
it
roused
his
wrath
to
such
a
pitch
that
he
wrote
in
the
most
stinging
and
sarcastic
terms
to
soult
he
is
astounded
he
says
to
find
the
chief
of
the
staff
suggesting
to
the
generals
that
the
marshal
should
be
requested
to
take
up
the
reins
of
government
and
assume
the
attributes
of
supreme
authority
if
he
had
assumed
sovereign
power
on
his
own
responsibility
it
would
have
been
a
crime
clear
an
attack
on
the
imperial
authority
how
could
a
man
of
sense
like
soult
suppose
that
his
master
would
permit
him
to
exercise
any
power
that
had
not
been
delegated
to
him
no
wonder
that
the
army
grew
discontented
and
that
rumours
got
about
that
the
marshal
was
working
for
himself
not
for
the
emperor
or
france
after
receiving
this
circular
it
is
doubtful
whether
any
french
officer
would
not
have
been
fully
justified
in
refusing
to
obey
any
further
orders
issued
from
oporto
fantin
des
odoards
writing
at
oporto
under
the
date
may
says
that
he
had
just
read
this
proclamation
on
the
walls
and
was
astounded
at
it
for
the
great
bulk
of
the
population
was
so
hostile
that
the
project
seemed
absolutely
insane
chamans
to
soult
speaks
of
the
crowds
assembled
by
veloso
and
others
bigarré
says
that
general
ricard
threw
money
to
the
crowd
for
seven
days
running
from
the
marshal
s
balcony
and
then
stopped
because
the
harvest
of
was
not
large
enough
see
fantin
des
odoards
and
jourdan
this
strange
document
will
be
found
printed
in
the
appendix
see
chamans
pp
and
he
ends
with
observing
that
soult
aurait
voulu
se
faire
demander
pour
roi
de
portugal
par
les
habitants
qu
alors
le
premier
pas
fait
il
aurait
sollicité
les
suffrages
de
l
armée
ils
auraient
été
consignés
sur
des
registres
pour
chaque
corps
et
il
aurait
mis
toutes
ces
pièces
sous
les
yeux
de
l
empereur
en
lui
demandant
son
napoleon
to
soult
from
schönbrunn
this
was
written
from
vienna
before
the
emperor
had
received
any
full
and
exact
account
of
the
details
of
soult
s
intrigues
had
he
but
known
them
all
it
is
doubtful
if
he
would
have
granted
his
lieutenant
the
complete
pardon
and
restoration
to
favour
with
which
his
dispatch
concludes
napier
s
conclusions
as
to
soult
s
conduct
are
wholly
warped
by
his
strong
predilection
for
the
marshal
which
dated
back
to
the
time
when
the
latter
dealt
kindly
with
his
wounded
brother
on
the
day
after
corunna
he
understates
soult
s
encouragement
of
the
movement
and
will
have
us
believe
that
it
was
purely
the
work
of
the
portuguese
he
omits
all
mention
of
ricard
s
circular
and
finally
suppresses
all
mention
of
napoleon
s
angry
upbraidings
except
the
following
ii
the
emperor
wrote
to
soult
that
the
rumour
had
reached
him
adding
with
a
delicate
allusion
to
the
marshal
s
previous
services
i
remember
nothing
but
now
it
was
not
a
which
had
reached
schönbrunn
but
a
copy
of
ricard
s
circular
which
the
emperor
quotes
therefore
napoleon
was
writing
with
tangible
evidence
not
with
camp
reports
to
guide
him
how
far
napier
s
sentence
above
gives
a
fair
impression
of
the
tone
of
the
dispatch
which
i
have
reproduced
i
leave
the
reader
to
judge
it
was
a
surprise
to
myself
when
i
put
the
two
together
once
and
for
all
it
must
be
remembered
that
napier
can
never
be
trusted
when
soult
is
in
question
the
marshal
s
intrigues
his
greed
his
shameful
plundering
of
andalusian
churches
are
all
concealed
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
duke
of
dalmatia
might
have
put
a
stop
to
all
the
activity
of
his
portuguese
friends
by
merely
raising
his
hand
it
would
have
sufficed
for
him
to
assure
the
deputations
which
visited
him
that
his
duty
as
the
lieutenant
of
the
emperor
forbade
him
to
listen
to
their
proposals
he
could
have
caused
the
proclamations
to
be
torn
down
and
have
silenced
the
street
orators
they
could
not
have
made
him
king
against
his
own
will
as
one
of
his
officers
remarked
but
no
action
of
the
kind
was
taken
and
the
movement
was
openly
encouraged
the
marshal
s
explanation
that
he
was
only
taking
the
best
means
in
his
power
to
build
up
a
french
party
in
oporto
will
not
stand
examination
why
should
the
scheme
involve
his
own
promotion
to
the
throne
if
his
views
were
disinterested
and
his
actions
merely
intended
to
serve
his
master
s
ends
is
it
conceivable
that
the
portuguese
should
of
their
own
accord
and
without
any
suggestion
from
without
have
hit
upon
the
idea
of
crowning
a
conqueror
whose
very
name
was
strange
to
them
three
weeks
before
and
whose
hands
were
red
with
the
blood
of
thousands
of
their
fellow
countrymen
clever
and
cautious
though
the
marshal
was
it
is
impossible
to
avoid
the
conclusion
that
he
had
for
once
allowed
his
ambition
to
take
the
bit
between
its
teeth
and
to
whirl
him
off
into
an
enterprise
that
was
worthy
of
the
most
of
adventurers
fantin
des
odoards
meanwhile
the
consequences
of
his
intrigue
were
strange
and
various
the
army
received
the
news
of
what
was
going
on
at
oporto
with
puzzled
surprise
of
those
who
were
not
present
at
the
centre
of
affairs
some
refused
to
believe
the
stories
that
reached
them
and
merely
observed
that
the
marshal
was
not
such
a
fool
as
to
take
in
hand
a
plan
that
was
both
treasonable
to
his
master
and
preposterous
in
itself
others
particularly
his
personal
enemies
not
only
credited
the
information
but
began
to
concert
measures
for
resisting
him
if
he
should
try
to
carry
out
his
scheme
this
party
was
very
strong
among
the
officers
of
junot
s
old
army
of
portugal
who
had
been
transferred
in
large
numbers
to
the
corps
they
disliked
the
expedition
had
been
prophesying
disaster
from
the
first
and
had
criticized
every
move
of
the
marshal
now
they
found
in
the
news
of
his
intrigue
another
excuse
for
running
counter
to
his
orders
there
is
good
reason
for
believing
that
loison
and
delaborde
had
actually
conferred
on
the
necessity
for
seizing
and
imprisoning
the
marshal
if
he
should
take
the
final
step
and
allow
himself
to
be
proclaimed
king
both
these
generals
were
faithful
adherents
of
napoleon
and
had
no
thought
save
that
of
serving
their
master
but
there
were
other
officers
who
watched
the
progress
of
affairs
with
very
different
eyes
so
writes
naylies
of
lahoussaye
s
dragoons

being
absent
at
amarante
and
elsewhere
never
saw

quelques
inquiétudes
qui
furent
bientôt
dissipées
there
had
existed
in
the
french
army
from
the
day
when
the
empire
was
first
proclaimed
a
party
of
malcontents
who
still
regarded
bonaparte
as
a
usurper
and
were
only
biding
their
time
till
it
might
be
safe
to
deal
a
blow
at
him
hitherto
his
career
had
been
so
uniformly
successful
that
no
opportunity
had
arisen
but
secret
societies
of
which
the
was
the
best
known
were
at
work
all
through
the
years
of
the
emperor
s
reign
their
one
object
was
to
be
ready
for
a
d
when
the
favourable
moment
should
arrive
the
history
of
these
associations
is
so
obscure
that
it
is
impossible
to
estimate
their
strength
at
any
given
time
no
trustworthy
historian
ever
arose
from
their
ranks
to
tell
the
story
of
their
schemes
when
lips
were
unsealed
by
the
fall
of
napoleon
it
is
only
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
phenomena
like
malet
s
conspiracy
of
and
the
plot
which
we
are
now
about
to
describe
that
the
reality
of
the
existence
of
these
secret
societies
is
proved
charles
nodier
s

conspirations
militaires
sous
l
is
unfortunately
quite
untrustworthy
he
was
never
among
the
and
writes
as
a
credulous
and
outsider
nevertheless
there
is
a
basis
of
fact
underlying
his
work
in
the
army
of
portugal
there
was
a
group
of
officers
who
belonged
to
the
band
of
the
discontented
and
were
perfectly
prepared
to
execute
a
against
the
empire
if
the
times
and
circumstances
proved
propitious
we
know
the
names
of
four
donadieu
colonel
of
the
of
the
line
lafitte
colonel
of
the
dragoons
his
brother
a
captain
in
the
same
regiment
who
was
serving
on
soult
s
staff
and
argenton
another
captain
who
was
adjutant
of
lafitte
s
regiment
two
other
plotters
are
hidden
under
the
assumed
names
of
dupont
and
garis
by
which
they
were
introduced
to
wellesley
there
were
other
officers
implicated
for
it
is
inconceivable
that
six
men
could
have
planned
an
insurrection
unless
they
were
sure
of
a
certain
measure
of
support
at
this
moment
they
were
carrying
on
an
active
propaganda
of
discontent
especially
among
the
officers
of
delaborde
s
division
and
of
lahoussaye
s
dragoons
there
were
many
men
who
saw
the
full
iniquity
of
the
spanish
war
and
were
disgusted
at
finding
themselves
involved
in
it
others
loathed
the
hanging
and
burning
the
shooting
of
priests
and
women
the
riding
down
of
peasants
which
had
been
their
lot
for
the
last
two
months
still
more
were
simply
discontented
at
being
lost
in
a
remote
corner
of
europe
where
glory
and
profit
were
both
absent
and
where
ignominious
death
at
the
hands
of
the
lurking
sniper
or
the
midnight
assassin
came
all
too
frequently
sometimes
death
accompanied
by
torture
it
was
three
months
since
the
army
had
received
a
mail
from
france
they
might
as
well
have
been
in
egypt
or
america
and
they
felt
themselves
forgotten
by
their
master
in
many
a
mind
the
question
arose
whether
the
game
was
worth
playing
must
they
for
ever
persist
in
this
wretched
interminable
campaign
in
order
that
the
duke
of
dalmatia
might
become
a
king
or
even
in
order
that
the
emperor
might
be
able
to
apply
the
continental
system
in
its
full
rigour
to
this
land
of
brutish
peasants
and
fanatical
monks
a
speedy
return
to
france
seemed
the
one
thing
desirable
the
names
of
argenton
lafitte
and
donadieu
are
public
property
napier
gives
them
as
does
bigarré
the
names
of
dupont
and
garis
are
in
suppressed
paragraphs
of
the
which
gurwood
chose
to
omit
and
are
also
found
in
the
minutes
of
argenton
s
trial
at
paris
the
reader
may
trace
this
feeling
in
foy
s
diaries
and
naylies
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
the
conspirators
found
many
sympathizers
so
long
as
they
confined
themselves
to
setting
forth
the
miseries
of
the
campaign
and
to
criticizing
the
marshal
and
the
emperor
but
they
erred
when
they
took
a
general
readiness
to
grumble
for
a
sign
that
the
army
was
ripe
for
revolt
however
discontented
the
officers
might
be
there
were
very
few
of
them
who
were
prepared
to
engage
in
the
game
of
high
treason
the
vast
majority
were
still
unable
to
dissociate
the
idea
of
the
emperor
from
the
idea
of
france
it
was
only
a
few
who
could
rise
or
sink
to
the
conception
of
turning
their
arms
against
bonaparte
in
order
to
free
france
from
autocracy
this
bore
too
close
a
resemblance
to
treachery
to
be
palatable
to
men
of
honour
none
save
exalted
jacobins
or
men
of
overweening
ambition
and
few
scruples
could
contemplate
the
idea
with
patience
when
we
find
that
the
plans
of
the
conspirators
included
not
merely
a
but
the
conclusion
of
a
secret
pact
with
the
enemies
in
arms
against
them
we
are
driven
to
conclude
that
they
belonged
to
the
of
these
classes
that
their
heads
were
turned
with
the
grandiose
notion
of
getting
an
army
into
their
power
and
changing
the
fate
of
europe
the
conspirators
observing
the
course
of
affairs
at
oporto
were
fully
convinced
that
soult
would
within
a
few
days
declare
himself
king
of
northern
this
act
would
produce
an
outburst
of
wrath
in
the
army
and
they
hoped
to
turn
the
inevitable
mutiny
to
their
own
profit
they
intended
to
seize
the
marshal
and
then
to
make
an
appeal
to
the
soldiery
not
in
the
name
of
napoleon
but
in
that
of
france
they
were
also
prepared
to
lay
hands
on
any
general
who
might
attempt
to
assume
command
of
the
troops
in
the
emperor
s
interest
donadieu
and
lafitte
had
secured
some
of
the
officers
of
their
own
regiments
and
believed
that
the
men
would
follow
them
the
other
corps
as
they
hoped
would
be
drawn
away
after
them
and
the
cry
of
liberty
and
the
promise
of
an
instant
return
to
france
would
lure
the
whole
army
into
rebellion
so
far
the
plot
though
rash
and
hazardous
might
conceivably
have
been
carried
out
but
their
next
step
was
to
be
the
issue
of
an
appeal
to
ney
s
divisions
and
the
other
french
troops
in
northern
spain
to
join
them
and
march
upon
the
pyrenees
even
though
there
were
members
of
the
secret
societies
scattered
all
through
the
army
it
seems
absolutely
impossible
to
believe
that
they
could
have
carried
away
with
them
into
open
revolt
the
whole
of
their
companions
the
movement
of
protest
against
napoleon
would
have
begun
and
ended
with
the
corps
if
even
it
got
so
far
as
the
initial
to
be
effective
it
would
have
required
a
strong
backing
in
france
and
the
list
of
the
leaders
in
that
country
on
whom
the
conspirators
said
that
they
relied
for
aid
does
not
give
us
a
high
opinion
of
the
strength
and
organization
of
the
plot
the
persons
named
were
the
old
jacobin
general
lecourbe
macdonald
who
though
they
did
not
know
it
had
just
been
taken
back
into
favour
by
the
emperor
and
dupont
who
was
in
prison
and
incapable
for
the
moment
of
helping
himself
or
any
one
else
they
also
spoke
of
sending
for
moreau
from
america
and
placing
him
at
the
head
of
the
whole
movement
but
it
is
clear
that
they
were
not
in
actual
communication
with
the
generals
in
france
much
less
with
the
exiled
victor
of
hohenlinden
the
whole
plan
was
it
was
the
result
of
the
intense
irritation
against
soult
and
bonaparte
felt
by
the
officers
of
the
army
of
portugal
acting
upon
the
disordered
ambition
of
a
knot
of
intriguers
anger
and
vain
blinded
them
to
the
inadequacy
of
their
resources
napier
and
le
noble
both
hint
that
loison
was
in
the
plot
and
perhaps
delaborde
though
they
do
not
actually
name
these
officers
but
i
think
that
their
innocence
is
proved
by
argenton
s
declaration
to
wellesley
wellesley
to
castlereagh
may
record
office
that
loison
was
attached
to
bonaparte
and
would
certainly
seize
soult
if
he
proclaimed
himself
king
for
ambitious
abuse
of
his
authority
and
disobedience
to
his
this
at
the
time
was
wellesley
s
eminently
sensible
conclusion
he
wrote
to
castlereagh
on
april
i
doubt
whether
it
will
be
quite
so
easy
as
their
emissary
thinks
to
carry
their
intentions
into
execution
i
also
doubt
whether
it
follows
that
the
successful
revolt
of
this
one
corps
would
be
followed
by
that
of
others
and
i
am
convinced
that
the
method
proposed
by
d
argenton
would
not
answer
that
iv
these
are
the
names
omitted
in
the
printed
version
of
the
that
of
moreau
does
not
occur
there
but
is
to
be
found
in
the
confession
which
argenton
made
to
soult
see
le
noble
it
was
a
main
condition
of
the
projected
outbreak
that
soult
s
position
should
be
made
impossible
the
most
favourable
course
of
events
so
the
conspirators
held
would
be
that
he
should
persist
in
his
monarchical
ambitions
and
proclaim
himself
king
when
he
did
so
the
party
loyal
to
bonaparte
among
his
officers
would
make
an
attempt
successful
or
unsuccessful
to
seize
his
person
chaos
and
civil
strife
within
the
army
would
result
and
it
was
then
that
the
conspirators
intended
to
show
their
hand
it
would
seem
that
their
machiavellian
foresight
went
so
far
that
they
proposed
to
wait
till
the
marshal
should
be
imprisoned
or
should
find
himself
involved
in
hostilities
with
the
bonapartists
and
then
offer
him
the
aid
of
their
regiments
on
condition
that
he
should
put
himself
at
the
head
of
the
movement
all
this
was
too
ingenious
for
practical
work
but
the
next
development
of
the
plot
was
even
more
astonishing
in
its
futile
cunning
the
conspirators
wished
to
draw
the
english
commander
at
lisbon
into
their
scheme
it
was
cradock
whom
they
had
in
view
for
wellesley
was
in
england
when
the
plot
began
and
when
it
developed
he
had
landed
indeed
but
his
arrival
was
not
known
the
part
which
they
had
allotted
to
cradock
was
twofold
he
was
to
be
asked
to
send
secret
advice
to
the
portuguese
notables
of
the
north
ordering
them
to
feign
an
enthusiastic
approval
of
soult
s
designs
on
the
crown
and
to
join
with
all
possible
clamour
in
the
demonstrations
at
oporto
when
this
unexpected
outburst
of
devotion
to
his
person
should
be
forthcoming
they
supposed
that
the
marshal
would
not
hesitate
any
longer
to
assume
the
crown
then
would
follow
civil
strife
and
the
desired
opportunity
for
intervention
by
the
conspirators
the
second
request
which
they
intended
to
make
was
that
cradock
should
bring
up
the
british
army
to
the
front
and
place
it
so
as
to
make
it
dangerous
or
impossible
for
soult
to
force
his
way
out
of
portugal
in
the
direction
of
the
middle
douro
and
salamanca
they
suggested
villa
real
in
the
as
a
suitable
position
for
him
their
idea
in
making
this
proposal
was
that
the
army
would
be
filled
with
despair
at
seeing
its
best
line
of
retreat
cut
off
that
by
galicia
was
growing
to
be
considered
impossible
and
would
therefore
be
more
incensed
against
soult
and
at
the
same
time
more
inclined
to
secure
safety
by
coming
to
a
pact
and
agreement
with
the
enemy
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
whole
plot
was
far
advanced
and
that
argenton
had
placed
himself
in
treasonable
communication
with
the
british
before
wellesley
landed
sir
arthur
came
ashore
on
the
night
of
april
on
the
morning
of
the
he
received
a
visit
from
beresford
who
came
down
from
coimbra
to
tell
him
that
a
french
officer
bearing
the
message
of
the
conspirators
had
come
within
the
portuguese
lines
on
the
vouga
on
the
argenton
arrived
at
lisbon
the
same
night
and
had
his
first
interview
with
the
new
whom
he
found
in
charge
of
the
british
army
and
not
as
he
had
expected
sir
john
cradock
the
three
requests
made
were
that
wellesley
would
press
upon
soult
s
corps
the
seizure
of
villa
real
being
suggested
that
he
would
give
passports
to
argenton
and
two
others
to
go
to
france
that
he
would
stir
up
the
portuguese
to
flatter
and
deceive
soult
into
taking
overt
steps
of
treason
cf
iv
lisbon
april
and
coimbra
may
the
officer
who
volunteered
for
the
dangerous
task
of
going
within
the
english
lines
was
captain
argenton
the
adjutant
of
lafitte
s
regiment
of
dragoons
he
was
a
vain
ready
plausible
man
full
of
resources
but
destitute
of
firmness
his
character
is
sufficiently
shown
by
the
fact
that
he
ultimately
wrecked
the
plot
by
his
indiscretion
in
tampering
with
loyal
bonapartists
who
delated
him
and
that
when
seized
he
betrayed
the
whole
scheme
to
soult
in
the
hope
of
saving
his
life
clearly
he
was
deficient
both
in
the
caution
and
in
the
stoic
courage
required
for
a
conspirator
successful
or
unsuccessful
we
must
note
that
he
started
from
the
camp
of
lahoussaye
s
dragoons
near
amarante
on
april
that
he
reached
the
french
outposts
on
the
vouga
and
got
into
communication
with
major
douglas
one
of
beresford
s
officers
in
the
portuguese
service
on
the
finally
that
at
the
invitation
of
douglas
and
beresford
he
came
into
lisbon
and
reached
that
city
on
the
just
in
time
to
meet
the
wellesley
the
plot
meanwhile
stood
still
in
his
absence
for
the
duke
of
dalmatia
did
not
take
the
overt
step
which
would
have
given
the
plotters
their
opportunity
he
refrained
from
accepting
the
crown
which
his
portuguese
partisans
were
so
continually
pressing
him
to
assume
nothing

occurred

the
situation
was
suddenly
changed
by
the
appearance
of

walking

he
came
on

muffled
in

cloaks

corner

stole
up

defending
portugal
in
common
fairness
to
moore
it
is
necessary
to
quote
wellesley
s
own
words
on
their
fundamental
difference
of
opinion
as
to
the
possibility
of
defending
portugal
i
have
as
much
respect
as
any
man
can
have
for
the
opinion
and
judgement
of
sir
moore
and
i
should
mistrust
my
own
if
opposed
to
his
in
a
case
where
he
had
an
opportunity
of
knowing
and
considering
but
he
positively
knew
nothing
of
portugal
and
know
nothing
of
its
existing
yet
he
says
that
the
greatest
disadvantage
under
which
i
labour
is
that
sir
john
moore
gave
an
opinion
that
the
country
could
not
be
defended
by
the
army
under
his
wellington
to
lord
liverpool
from
vizeu
april
i
can
say
generally
that
the
frontier
of
portugal
is
not
defensible
against
a
superior
force
it
is
an
open
frontier
all
equally
rugged
but
all
equally
to
be
penetrated
if
the
french
succeed
in
spain
it
will
be
vain
to
attempt
to
resist
them
in
portugal
the
portuguese
are
without
a
military
force
no
dependence
can
be
placed
on
any
aid
that
they
can
give
the
british
must
in
that
event
i
conceive
immediately
take
steps
to
evacuate
the
country
lisbon
is
the
only
port
and
therefore
the
only
place
from
whence
the
army
with
its
stores
can
embark
we
might
check
the
progress
of
the
enemy
while
the
stores
are
embarking
and
arrangements
are
being
made
for
taking
off
the
army
beyond
this
the
defence
of
lisbon
or
of
portugal
should
not
be
thought
four
months
later
on
march
sir
arthur
wellesley
answered
the
same
question
put
to
him
by
the
same
minister
in
very
different
terms
i
have
always
been
of
opinion
that
portugal
might
be
defended
whatever
might
be
the
result
of
the
contest
in
spain
and
that
in
the
meantime
measures
adopted
for
the
defence
of
portugal
would
be
highly
useful
to
the
spaniards
in
their
contest
with
the
french
my
notion
was
that
the
portuguese
military
establishment
ought
to
be
revived
and
that
in
addition
to
those
troops
his
majesty
ought
to
employ
about
british
troops
including
about
cavalry
my
opinion
was
that
even
if
spain
should
have
been
conquered
the
french
would
not
be
able
to
overrun
portugal
with
a
smaller
force
than
men
as
long
as
the
contest
may
continue
in
spain
this
force
the
british
troops
if
it
could
be
placed
in
a
state
of
activity
would
be
highly
useful
to
the
spaniards
and
might
eventually
decide
the
between
these
two
divergent
views
as
to
the
practicability
of
defending
portugal
lord
castlereagh
had
to
make
his
decision
on
it
though
he
could
not
be
aware
of
the
fact
depended
the
future
of
britain
and
of
bonaparte
he
carefully
considered
the
situation
after
the
disasters
of
the
corunna
retreat
it
required
some
moral
courage
for
a
minister
to
advise
the
sending
of
another
british
army
to
the
peninsula
moore
s
gloomy
prognostications
were
echoed
by
many
military
experts
and
there
were
leading
men
soldiers
and
politicians
who
declared
that
the
only
thing
that
now
remained
to
be
done
was
to
withdraw
cradock
s
sabres
and
bayonets
from
lisbon
before
the
french
came
near
enough
to
that
city
to
make
their
embarkation
difficult
castlereagh
resolved
to
stake
his
faith
on
the
correctness
of
wellesley
s
conclusions
all
through
these
years
of
contest
he
had
made
him
his
most
trusted
adviser
on
things
military
and
now
he
did
not
swerve
from
his
confidence
he
announced
to
him
privately
in
the
end
of
march
and
officially
on
april
that
the
experiment
of
a
second
expedition
to
portugal
should
be
tried
and
that
he
himself
should
have
the
conduct
of
it
reinforcements
should
at
once
be
sent
out
to
bring
the
british
army
at
lisbon
up
to
a
total
of
men
the
number
to
which
wellesley
on
consideration
raised
the
original
of
which
he
had
spoken
beresford
had
already
sailed
with
orders
to
do
all
that
he
could
for
the
reorganization
of
the
disorderly
native
forces
of
portugal
the
few
regiments
in
england
that
were
ready
for
instant
embarkation
were
sent
off
ere
march
ended
and
began
to
arrive
at
lisbon
early
in
april
others
were
rapidly
prepared
for
foreign
service
but
it
was
a
misfortune
that
the
corunna
battalions
were
still
too
sickly
and
depleted
to
be
able
to
sail
so
that
troops
who
had
seen
nothing
of
the
first
campaign
had
to
be
sent
out
the
majority
of
them
were
second
battalions
from
the
home
establishment
many
of
them
very
weak
in
numbers
and
full
of
young
soldiers
as
they
had
been
drained
in
the
previous
year
to
fill
their
first
battalions
up
to
full
strength
finally
just
behind
the
first
convoys
of
reinforcements
wellesley
himself
set
sail
from
portsmouth
after
resigning
his
position
as
under
secretary
for
ireland
which
by
a
curious
anomaly
he
had
continued
to
hold
all
through
the
campaign
of
vimiero
and
the
proceedings
of
inquiry
concerning
the
convention
of
cintra
he
sailed
upon
april
in
the
frigate
had
the
narrowest
of
escapes
from
shipwreck
on
the
isle
of
wight
during
the
first
night
of
his
voyage
but
soon
obtained
favourable
winds
and
reached
lisbon
on
the
after
a
rapid
passage
of
less
than
eight
days
just
before
he
started
there
had
been
received
from
portugal
not
only
the
correct
intelligence
that
soult
had
stormed
oporto
upon
march
but
a
false
rumour
that
victor
had
been
joined
by
the
corps
of
sebastiani
and
had
after
his
victory
at
medellin
laid
siege
to
badajoz
if
this
had
been
true
the
duke
of
belluno
would
have
been
strong
enough
to
move
against
portugal
with
men
after
detaching
a
competent
force
to
watch
the
wrecks
of
cuesta
s
army
fortunately
the
whole
story
was
an
invention
but
it
kept
wellesley
in
a
state
of
feverish
anxiety
till
he
reached
lisbon
his
fears
are
shown
by
the
fact
that
he
drew
up
a
memorandum
for
lord
castlereagh
setting
forth
the
supposed
situation
and
asking
what
he
was
to
do
on
arriving
if
he
should
find
that
cradock
had
already
embarked
his
troops
and
quitted
portugal
the
secretary
of
state
equally
harrassed
by
the
false
intelligence
replied
that
he
was
to
make
an
effort
to
induce
the
spaniards
to
let
him
land
the
army
at
cadiz
and
if
they
should
refuse
might
reinforce
the
garrison
of
gibraltar
to
men
and
bring
the
rest
of
the
expeditionary
force
back
to
england
the
official
notice
is
dated
april
supplementary
vi
but
several
letters
dated
late
in
march
show
that
the
matter
had
been
already
settled
the
troops
from
the
abortive
expedition
to
cadiz
under
mackenzie
sherbrooke
and
tilson
turned
up
about
the
middle
of
march
at
lisbon
but
hill
with
the
first
body
of
the
second
batch
of
reinforcements
only
appeared
upon
april
of
the
first
ten
battalions
to
appear
seven
were
battalions
those
of
the
regiments
some
were
very
weak
with
less
than
bayonets
the
men

this
came
from
beresford
at
lisbon
see
supplementary
vi
wellesley
to
the
duke
of
richmond
april
vi
supplementary
vi
it
is
very
creditable
to
sir
arthur
that
adverting
to
another
possibility
viz
that
cradock
may
have
plucked
up
courage
to
go
out
against
the
french
and
have
successfully
beaten
them
off
he
declares
that
he
could
not
reconcile
it
with
his
feelings
to
supersede
a
successful
general
he
remembered
his
own
state
of
mind
when
supplanted
by
burrard
on
the
day
of
vimiero
castlereagh
to
wellesley
vi
and
it
was
therefore
an
immense
relief
to
wellesley
to
find
when
he
landed
that
the
news
from
estremadura
was
false
that
victor
had
not
been
reinforced
and
that
the
corps
was
lying
quiescent
at
merida
soult
was
still
at
oporto
cradock
had
not
been
molested
and
the
french
invasion
was
at
a
standstill
it
is
comparatively
seldom
that
the
historian
is
able
to
compare
in
detail
a
general
s
original
conception
of
a
plan
of
campaign
with
the
actual
scheme
which
he
carried
out
still
less
common
is
it
to
find
that
the
commander
has
placed
on
record
his
ideas
as
to
the
general
policy
to
be
pursued
during
a
war
before
he
has
assumed
charge
of
his
army
or
issued
his
first
orders
it
is
therefore
most
fortunate
that
we
have
three
documents
from
wellesley
s
hand
written
early
in
which
enable
us
to
understand
the
principles
on
which
he
believed
that
the
peninsular
war
should
be
fought
out
these
are
his
on
the
defence
of
which
we
have
already
had
occasion
to
quote
and
the
two
dispatches
to
lord
castlereagh
and
to
frere
which
he
wrote
immediately
after
his
arrival
in
lisbon
the
first
gives
us
his
general
view
of
the
war
he
believed
that
an
english
army
of
or
men
backed
by
the
levies
of
portugal
would
be
able
to
maintain
itself
on
the
flank
of
the
french
army
in
spain
its
presence
there
would
paralyse
all
the
offensive
actions
of
the
enemy
and
enable
the
spaniards
to
make
head
against
the
invaders
as
long
as
portugal
remained
unsubdued
the
news
that
a
british
army
had
once
more
taken
the
field
would
he
considered
induce
the
french
to
turn
their
main
efforts
against
portugal
but
he
believed
that
considering
the
geography
of
the
country
the
character
of
its
people
and
the
quality
of
the
british
troops
they
would
fail
in
their
attempt
to
overrun
it
they
could
not
succeed
as
he
supposed
unless
they
could
set
aside
men
for
the
task
and
he
did
not
see
how
they
would
ever
be
able
to
spare
such
a
large
detachment
out
of
the
total
force
which
they
then
possessed
in
the
peninsula
a
force
whose
numerical
strength
in
common
with
all
british
statesmen
and
soldiers
of
the
day
he
somewhat
underrated
being
in
the
secrets
of
the
ministry
he
was
already
aware
in
march
that
a
new
war
in
germany
was
about
to
break
out
within
the
next
few
months
when
austria
took
the
field
napoleon
would
not
be
able
to
spare
a
single
battalion
of
reinforcements
for
spain
if
the
spaniards
pursued
a
reasonable
military
policy
and
occupied
the
attention
of
the
main
armies
of
the
french
the
enemy
would
never
be
able
to
detach
a
force
of
for
the
invasion
of
portugal
he
would
underrate
the
numbers
required
make
his
attempt
with
insufficient
resources
and
be
beaten
when
wellesley
landed
at
lisbon
and
found
that
soult
had
halted
at
oporto
that
victor
lay
quiescent
at
merida
and
that
lapisse
with
the
troops
from
salamanca
had
gone
southward
to
join
the
corps
and
so
severed
the
only
link
which
bound
together
the
army
in
northern
portugal
and
the
army
in
estremadura
he
was
reassured
as
to
the
whole
situation
soult
and
victor
isolated
as
they
now
were
would
each
be
too
weak
to
beat
the
army
they
were
too
far
apart
to
make
between
them
possible
considering
the
geography
of
central
portugal
and
the
fact
that
the
whole
country
behind
each
was
in
a
state
of
insurrection
memorandum
of
march
as
soon
as
the
newspapers
shall
have
announced
the
departure
of
officers
for
portugal
the
french
armies
in
spain
will
receive
orders
to
make
their
movements
towards
portugal
so
as
to
anticipate
our
measures
for
its
defence
it
is
noteworthy
that
wellesley
when
he
was
placed
in
communication
with
argenton
three
days
later
considered
that
one
of
the
few
useful
facts
which
he
had
got
from
the
plotter
was
that
soult
and
his
army
had
no
knowledge
of
where
victor
might
be
or
of
what
he
was
doing
this
was
a
far
more
precious
piece
of
information
than
any
details
as
to
the
conspiracy
which
wellesley
regarded
from
the
first
as
doomed
to
failure
see
iv
but
the
best
defensive
is
a
vigorous
local
offensive
and
wellesley
saw
the
advantage
of
the
central
position
of
the
british
army
upon
the
tagus
a
few
marches
would
place
it
at
a
point
from
which
it
could
fall
either
upon
victor
to
the
right
or
soult
to
the
left
before
either
marshal
could
be
in
a
position
to
lend
help
to
his
colleague
probably
long
before
he
would
even
be
aware
that
his
colleague
was
in
danger
wellesley
could
strike
at
the
one
or
the
other
with
almost
perfect
certainty
of
catching
him
unreinforced
ney
it
was
true
lay
behind
soult
but
he
was
known
to
be
entangled
in
the
trammels
of
the
vigorous
galician
insurrection
victor
had
sebastiani
in
his
rear
but
the
corps
was
having
occupation
found
for
it
by
the
spanish
army
of
la
mancha
it
was
improbable
that
either
soult
or
victor
if
suddenly
attacked
could
call
up
any
appreciable
reinforcements
victor
moreover
had
cuesta
to
observe
and
could
not
move
off
leaving
spaniards
behind
him
soult
was
known
to
be
distracted
by
silveira
s
operations
on
the
tamega
wellesley
therefore
saw
that
it
was
well
within
his
power
to
strike
at
either
of
the
marshals
he
would
of
course
be
obliged
to
place
a
containing
force
in
front
of
the
one
whom
he
resolved
to
leave
alone
for
the
present
but
this
detachment
need
not
be
very
large
and
might
be
composed
for
the
most
part
of
portuguese
troops
its
duty
would
be
to
distract
but
not
to
fight
the
enemy
on
the
whole
wellesley
thought
it
would
be
best
to
make
the
first
onslaught
on
soult
i
should
prefer
an
attack
on
victor
he
wrote
two
days
after
landing
in
concert
with
cuesta
if
soult
were
not
in
possession
of
a
fertile
province
of
this
kingdom
and
of
the
favourite
town
of
oporto
of
which
it
is
most
desirable
to
deprive
him
any
operation
upon
victor
connected
with
cuesta
s
movements
would
require
time
to
concert
which
may
as
well
be
employed
in
dislodging
soult
from
the
north
of
portugal
before
bringing
the
british
army
to
the
eastern
frontier
i
intend
to
move
upon
soult
as
soon
as
i
can
make
some
arrangement
on
which
i
can
depend
for
the
defence
of
the
tagus
to
impede
or
delay
victor
s
progress
in
case
he
should
come
on
while
i
am
i
think
it
probable
he
wrote
on
the
same
day
but
in
another
letter
that
soult
will
not
remain
in
portugal
when
i
pass
the
mondego
if
he
does
i
shall
attack
him
if
he
should
retire
i
am
convinced
that
it
would
be
most
advantageous
for
the
common
cause
that
we
should
remain
on
the
defensive
in
the
north
of
portugal
and
act
vigorously
in
with
cuesta
against
victor
wellesley
to
castlereagh
from
lisbon
april
i
have
ventured
to
substitute
before
bringing
in
the
last
sentence
for
the
unmeaning
and
to
bring
which
is
clearly
a
wellesley
to
frere
at
seville
from
lisbon
april
in
many
sentences
this
dispatch
is
only
a
repetition
of
that
to
castlereagh
but
in
others
sir
arthur
makes
his
meaning
more
clear
by
a
more
detailed
explanation
further
forward
it
was
impossible
to
look
a
blow
at
soult
followed
by
another
at
victor
was
all
that
could
at
present
be
contemplated
wellesley
was
directed
by
the
formal
instructions
which
he
had
received
from
castlereagh
to
do
all
that
was
possible
to
clear
portugal
and
the
frontier
provinces
of
spain
from
the
enemy
but
not
to
strike
deep
into
the
peninsula
till
he
should
have
received
permission
from
home
to
do
so
nevertheless
he
had
devoted
some
thought
to
the
remoter
possibilities
of
the
situation
if
portugal
were
preserved
and
soult
and
victor
beaten
off
more
ambitious
combinations
might
become
possible
he
expressed
his
conviction
that
the
french
occupation
of
spain
would
only
be
endangered
when
a
very
large
force
acting
in
unison
under
the
guidance
of
a
single
mind
should
be
brought
together
the
of
the
english
army
and
that
of
cuesta
might
be
the
groundwork
of
further
measures
of
the
same
and
a
more
extended
description
he
was
under
no
delusions
as
to
the
easiness
of
the
task
before
him
he
did
not
hurry
on
in
thought
to
dream
of
the
expulsion
of
the
french
from
the
peninsula
as
a
goal
already
in
sight
but
he
believed
that
he
and
his
army
might
be
highly
useful
to
the
spaniards
and
might
eventually
decide
the
contest
wellesley
to
frere
lisbon
april
on
the
defence
of
of
march
it
is
the
survey
of
documents
such
as
these
that
enables
us
to
appreciate
wellesley
at
his
best
he
had
gauged
perfectly
well
the
situation
and
difficulties
of
the
french
he
saw
exactly
how
much
was
in
his
own
power
the
whole
history
of
the
peninsular
war
for
the
next
two
years
is
foreseen
in
his
prophetic
statement
that
with
british
troops
and
the
portuguese
levies
he
would
guarantee
to
hold
his
own
against
any
force
of
less
than
french
and
that
he
did
not
think
that
the
enemy
would
find
it
easy
to
collect
an
army
of
that
size
to
send
against
him
this
is
precisely
what
he
accomplished
for
the
first
fifteen
months
after
his
arrival
he
held
with
ease
that
frontier
which
moore
had
described
as
indefensible
against
a
superior
when
at
last
napoleon
free
from
all
other
continental
troubles
launched
against
him
an
army
under
masséna
which
almost
reached
the
figure
that
he
had
described
as
irresistible
in
he
showed
in
that
he
had
built
up
resources
for
himself
which
enabled
him
to
beat
off
even
that
number
of
enemies
though
of
spain
had
been
subdued
he
held
his
own
because
he
had
grasped
the
fundamental
truth
that
to
use
his
own
words
the
more
ground
the
french
hold
down
the
weaker
will
they
be
at
any
given
in
short
he
had
fathomed
the
great
secret
that
napoleon
s
military
power
vast
as
it
was
had
its
limits
that
the
emperor
could
not
send
to
spain
a
force
sufficient
to
hold
down
every
province
of
a
thoroughly
disaffected
country
and
also
to
provide
over
and
above
the
garrisons
a
field
army
large
enough
to
beat
the
and
capture
lisbon
if
the
french
dispersed
their
divisions
and
kept
down
the
vast
tracts
of
conquered
territory
they
had
no
force
left
with
which
to
take
the
offensive
against
portugal
if
they
massed
their
armies
they
had
to
give
up
broad
regions
which
immediately
relapsed
into
insurrection
and
required
to
be
subdued
again
this
was
as
true
in
the
beginning
of
the
war
as
in
the
end
in
the
army
that
forced
wellesley
to
retreat
after
talavera
was
only
produced
by
evacuating
the
whole
province
of
galicia
which
passed
back
into
the
hands
of
the
insurgents
in
in
a
similar
way
the
overpowering
force
which
beat
him
back
from
burgos
had
been
gathered
only
by
surrendering
to
the
spanish
government
the
whole
of
the
four
kingdoms
of
andalusia
on
the
other
hand
during
the
long
periods
when
the
enemy
had
dispersed
himself
and
was
garrisoning
the
whole
south
and
centre
of
spain
for
the
first
six
months
of
and
for
the
last
six
months
of
wellesley
held
his
own
on
the
portuguese
frontier
in
complete
confidence
assured
that
no
sufficient
force
could
be
brought
up
against
him
till
the
enemy
either
procured
new
troops
from
france
or
gave
up
some
great
section
of
the
regions
which
he
was
holding
down
a
detailed
insight
into
the
future
is
impossible
to
any
general
however
great
but
already
in
april
wellesley
had
grasped
the
main
outlines
of
the
war
that
was
to
be
if
to
masséna
s
field
army
of
men
we
add
the
troops
on
his
communications
viz
the
corps
and
the
garrisons
of
rodrigo
and
almeida
and
also
the
force
which
soult
and
mortier
brought
up
against
badajoz
and
elvas
a
force
against
which
wellesley
had
to
provide
by
making
large
detachments
the
full
number
of
is
reached
before
passing
on
to
the
details
of
the
campaign
on
the
douro
with
which
wellesley
s
long
series
of
victories
began
it
is
well
to
take
a
glance
at
the
man
himself
as
he
sat
at
his
desk
in
lisbon
dictating
the
orders
that
were
to
change
the
face
of
the
war
arthur
wellesley
was
now
within
a
few
days
of
completing
his
fortieth
year
he
was
a
slight
but
wiry
man
of
middle
stature
with
a
long
face
an
aquiline
nose
and
a
keen
but
cold
grey
eye
owning
an
iron
constitution
on
which
no
climate
or
season
seemed
to
make
the
least
impression
he
was
physically
fit
for
all
the
work
that
lay
before
him
work
more
fatiguing
than
that
which
falls
to
most
generals
for
in
the
peninsula
he
was
required
as
it
soon
appeared
to
be
almost
as
much
of
a
statesman
as
of
a
general
while
at
the
same
time
owing
to
the
inexperience
of
the
british
officers
of
that
day
in
warfare
on
a
large
scale
he
was
obliged
for
some
time
to
discharge
for
himself
many
of
the
duties
which
properly
fall
to
the
lot
of
the
chief
of
the
staff
the
the
and
the
in
a
well
organized
army
no
amount
of
toil
bodily
or
mental
appeared
too
much
for
that
active
and
alert
mind
or
for
the
body
which
seven
years
of
service
in
india
seemed
to
have
tanned
and
hardened
rather
than
to
have
relaxed
during
the
whole
of
his
peninsular
campaigns
from
to
he
was
never
prostrated
by
any
serious
ailment
autumn
rains
summer
heat
the
cold
of
winter
had
no
power
over
him
he
could
put
up
with
a
very
small
allowance
of
sleep
and
when
necessary
could
snatch
useful
moments
of
repose
at
any
moment
of
the
hours
when
no
pressing
duty
chanced
to
be
on
hand
his
manner
of
life
was
simple
and
austere
in
the
extreme
no
ever
travelled
with
less
baggage
or
could
be
content
with
more
spartan
fare
long
after
his
wars
were
over
the
habit
of
bleak
frugality
clung
to
him
and
in
his
old
age
men
wondered
at
the
bare
and
comfortless
surroundings
that
he
chose
for
himself
and
at
the
scanty
meals
that
sustained
his
spare
but
active
frame
officers
who
had
long
served
in
india
were
generally
supposed
to
contract
habits
of
luxury
and
display
but
wellesley
was
the
exception
that
proved
the
rule
he
hated
show
of
any
kind
after
the
first
few
days
of
the
campaign
of
he
discarded
the
escort
which
was
wont
to
accompany
the
it
was
on
very
rare
occasions
that
he
was
seen
in
his
full
uniform
the
army
knew
him
best
in
the
plain
blue
frock
coat
the
small
featherless
cocked
hat
and
the
short
cape
which
have
been
handed
down
to
us
in
a
hundred
drawings
not
unfrequently
he
would
ride
about
among
his
cantonments
dressed
like
a
civilian
in
a
round
hat
and
grey
trousers
he
was
as
careless
about
the
dress
of
his
subordinates
as
about
his
own
and
there
probably
never
existed
an
army
in
which
so
little
fuss
was
made
about
unessential
trappings
as
that
which
served
in
the
peninsula
from
to
nothing
could
be
less
showy
than
its
staff
a
small
group
of
officers
with
an
orderly
dragoon
or
two
riding
in
the
wake
of
the
dark
cape
and
low
glazed
cocked
hat
of
the
most
unpretentious
of
chiefs
it
contrasted
in
the
strangest
way
with
the
plumes
and
gold
lace
of
the
french
marshals
and
their
elaborately
ornate
staffs
see
for
example
the
anecdote
in
sir
l
estrange
s
picton
was
equally
given
to
the
use
or
abuse
of
and
fought
quatre
bras
in
a
tall
hat
provided
we
brought
our
men
into
the
field
well
appointed
and
with
sixty
good
rounds
in
their
pouches
he
never
looked
to
see
whether
our
trousers
were
black
or
blue
or
grey
scarcely
any
two
officers
dressed
alike
some
wore
grey
braided
coats
others
brown
some
liked
blue
many
from
choice
or
necessity
stuck
to
the
old
red
we
were
never
tormented
with
that
greatest
of
on
active
service
uniformity
of
s
with
the
to
find
a
humorous
contrast
to
wellington
s
staff
the
reader
might
consult
lejeune
s
account
of
that
of
berthier
who
had
allowed
him
to
design
a
special
and
gorgeous
uniform
all
fur
feathers
and
braid
for
his
lejeune
dwells
with
the
enthusiasm
of
a
tailor
on
his
efforts
and
their
glorious
effect
on
parade
lejeune
considered
as
a
man
wellesley
had
his
defects
and
his
limitations
we
shall
have
ere
long
to
draw
attention
to
some
of
them
but
from
the
intellectual
point
of
view
he
commands
our
undivided
admiration
as
a
practical
soldier
a
careful
study
of
his
dispatches
leaves
us
in
a
state
of
wonder
at
the
imbecility
of
the
school
of
writers
mostly
continental
who
have
continued
to
assert
for
the
last
eighty
years
that
he
was
no
more
than
a
man
of
ordinary
abilities
who
had
an
unfair
share
of
good
luck
and
was
presented
with
a
series
of
victories
by
the
mistakes
and
jealousies
of
the
generals
opposed
to
him
such
assertions
are
the
results
of
blind
ignorance
and
prejudice
when
found
in
english
writers
they
merely
reflect
the
bitter
hatred
that
was
felt
toward
wellesley
by
his
political
opponents
during
the
second
and
third
decades
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
french
military
authors
they
only
represent
the
resentful
carpings
of
the
vanquished
army
which
preferred
to
think
that
it
was
beaten
by
anything
rather
than
by
the
ability
of
the
conqueror
in
every
retired
colonel
across
the
channel
was
ready
to
demonstrate
that
toulouse
was
an
english
defeat
that
talavera
was
a
drawn
battle
and
that
wellesley
was
or
a
fool
or
a
coward
according
as
their
thesis
of
the
moment
might
demand
they
were
but
echoing
their
emperor
s
rancorous
remark
to
soult
on
the
hillside
of
la
belle
alliance
when
after
telling
the
marshal
that
he
only
thought
his
old
adversary
a
good
general
because
he
had
been
beaten
by
him
he
added
et
moi
je
vous
dis
que
wellington
est
un
mauvais
général
et
que
les
anglais
sont
de
mauvaises
troupes
lord
roberts
in
his
of
only
slightly
overstates
his
case
when
he
observes
that
the
more
we
study
wellesley
s
life
in
detail
the
more
we
respect
him
as
a
general
and
the
less
we
like
him
as
a
man
if
we
come
upon
much
that
is
hard
and
unsympathetic
there
are
too
many
redeeming
traits
to
justify
the
statement
in
its
entirety
the
reader
curious
in
such
things
may
find
as
much
as
he
desires
of
this
sort
of
stuff
in
thiébault
marbot
le
noble
and
lemonnier
delafosse
these
phrases
are
preserved
in
the
notes
of
soult
s
baudus
bonaparte
consistently
refused
to
do
justice
to
the
abilities
of
the
duke
he
regarded
him
as
a
bitter
personal
enemy
and
his
whole
attitude
towards
wellesley
was
expressed
in
the
scandalous
legacy
to
cantillon
which
disgraces
his
last
will
and
testament
in
strict
conformity
with
their
master
s
pose
his
followers
literary
and
military
have
refused
to
see
anything
great
in
the
victor
of
june
even
to
the
present
day
too
many
historians
from
the
other
side
of
the
straits
continue
to
follow
in
the
steps
of
thiers
and
to
express
wonder
at
the
inexplicable
triumphs
of
the
mediocre
general
who
routed
in
succession
all
the
best
marshals
of
france
cantillon
was
the
assassin
who
fired
on
wellington
in
paris
on
to
clear
away
any
lingering
doubts
as
to
wellesley
s
extraordinary
ability
the
student
of
history
has
only
to
read
a
few
of
his
more
notable
dispatches
the
man
who
could
write
the
two
memoranda
to
castlereagh
dated
september
and
march
foresaw
the
whole
future
of
the
peninsular
war
to
know
at
that
early
stage
of
the
struggle
that
the
spaniards
would
be
beaten
when
and
wherever
they
offered
battle
that
the
french
in
spite
of
their
victories
would
never
be
able
to
conquer
and
hold
down
the
entire
country
that
british
troops
would
be
able
to
defend
portugal
against
any
force
that
could
be
collected
against
them
required
the
mind
of
a
soldier
of
the
first
class
when
the
earliest
of
those
memoranda
was
written
most
englishmen
believed
that
the
spaniards
were
about
to
deliver
their
country
by
their
own
arms
wellesley
saw
that
the
notion
was
vain
and
absurd
when
on
the
other
hand
he
wrote
the
second
the
idea
was
abroad
that
all
was
lost
that
after
corunna
no
second
british
army
would
be
sent
to
the
peninsula
and
that
portugal
was
indefensible
far
from
sharing
these
gloomy
views
he
asks
for
men
and
states
that
though
spain
may
be
overrun
though
the
portuguese
army
may
be
in
a
state
of
hopeless
disarray
he
yet
hopes
with
this
handful
of
men
to
maintain
the
struggle
and
eventually
to
decide
the
contest
how
many
generals
has
the
world
seen
who
could
have
framed
such
a
prophecy
and
have
verified
it
wellington
to
castlereagh
zambujal
and
london
march
to
talk
of
the
good
fortune
of
wellesley
of
his
lucky
star
is
absurd
he
had
like
other
generals
his
occasional
uncovenanted
mercies
and
happy
chances
but
few
commanders
had
more
strokes
of
undeserved
disappointment
or
saw
more
of
their
plans
frustrated
by
a
stupid
subordinate
an
unexpected
turn
of
the
weather
an
incalculable
accident
or
a
piece
of
false
news
he
had
his
fair
proportion
of
the
chances
of
war
good
and
bad
and
no
more
if
fortune
was
with
him
at
oporto
in
or
at
el
bodon
in
how
many
were
the
occasions
on
which
she
played
him
scurvy
tricks
a
few
examples
may
suffice
in
may
he
might
have
captured
the
whole
of
soult
s
army
if
silveira
had
but
obeyed
orders
and
occupied
the
impregnable
defile
of
salamonde
on
the
night
of
salamanca
he
might
have
dealt
in
a
similar
fashion
with
marmont
s
routed
host
if
carlos
d
españa
had
not
withdrawn
the
garrison
of
alba
de
tormes
in
flat
disobedience
to
his
instructions
and
so
left
the
fords
open
to
the
flying
french
it
is
needless
to
multiply
instances
of
such
incalculable
misfortune
any
serious
student
of
the
peninsular
war
can
cite
them
by
the
dozen
masséna
s
invasion
of
portugal
in
would
have
been
checked
by
the
autumn
rains
and
never
have
penetrated
far
within
the
frontier
but
for
the
unlucky
bomb
which
blew
up
the
grand
magazine
at
almeida
and
reduced
in
a
day
a
fortress
which
ought
to
have
held
out
for
a
month
in
the
autumn
of
the
retreat
beyond
the
douro
need
never
have
been
made
if
ballasteros
had
obeyed
orders
and
moved
up
from
granada
to
threaten
soult
s
flank
instead
of
remaining
torpid
in
his
cantonments
miles
from
the
theatre
of
war
wellington
was
not
the
child
of
fortune
he
was
a
great
strategist
and
tactician
placed
in
a
situation
in
which
the
military
dangers
furnished
but
half
his
difficulties
he
had
to
cherish
his
single
precious
british
army
corps
and
to
keep
it
from
any
unnecessary
loss
because
if
destroyed
it
could
not
be
replaced
with
those
men
he
had
promised
to
keep
up
the
war
the
home
government
was
reluctant
to
risk
the
whole
of
its
available
field
army
in
one
quarter
and
for
years
refused
to
raise
his
numbers
far
above
that
total
it
was
not
till
the
middle
of
that
his
original
five
divisions
of
infantry
were
increased
to
six
nor
till
that
his
seventh
and
eighth
divisions
were
completed
right
down
to
it
was
certain
that
if
he
had
lost
any
considerable
fraction
of
his
modest
army
the
ministry
might
have
recalled
him
and
abandoned
portugal
he
had
to
fight
with
a
full
consciousness
that
a
single
disaster
would
have
been
irreparable
because
it
would
have
been
followed
not
by
the
sending
off
of
reinforcements
to
replace
the
divisions
that
might
be
lost
but
by
an
order
to
evacuate
the
peninsula
his
french
opponents
fought
under
no
such
disabilities
when
beaten
they
had
other
armies
at
hand
on
which
to
fall
back
and
behind
all
the
inexhaustible
reserve
of
napoleon
s
conscription
considering
the
campaigns
of
it
is
not
wellington
s
prudence
that
we
find
astonishing
but
his
boldness
instead
of
wondering
that
he
did
not
attempt
to
relieve
rodrigo
or
almeida
in
or
to
fall
upon
masséna
at
santarem
in
january
we
are
filled
with
surprise
at
the
daring
which
inspired
the
storming
of
oporto
and
the
offering
of
battle
at
busaco
and
fuentes
d
oñoro
when
a
defeat
spelt
ruin
and
recall
it
required
no
small
courage
to
take
any
risks
but
wellesley
had
the
sanest
of
minds
he
could
draw
the
line
with
absolute
accuracy
between
enterprise
and
rashness
between
the
possible
and
the
impossible
he
had
learned
to
gauge
with
wonderful
insight
the
difficulties
and
disabilities
of
his
enemies
and
to
see
exactly
how
far
they
might
be
reckoned
upon
in
discounting
the
military
situation
after
some
time
he
arrived
at
an
accurate
estimate
of
the
individual
marshals
opposed
to
him
and
was
ready
to
take
the
personal
equation
into
consideration
according
as
he
had
to
deal
with
soult
or
masséna
marmont
or
jourdan
in
short
he
was
a
safe
general
not
a
cautious
one
when
once
the
hopeless
disparity
between
his
own
resources
and
those
of
the
enemy
had
ceased
to
exist
in
the
year
he
soon
showed
the
worth
of
the
silly
taunts
which
imputed
timidity
to
him
by
the
smashing
blows
which
reduced
ciudad
rodrigo
and
badajoz
and
the
which
dashed
to
pieces
marmont
s
army
at
salamanca
in
the
next
year
when
for
the
first
time
he
could
count
on
an
actual
superiority
of
force
his
irresistible
march
to
vittoria
displayed
his
mastery
of
the
art
of
using
an
advantage
to
the
uttermost
napoleon
himself
never
punished
a
strategic
fault
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
with
such
majestic
ease
and
confidence
the
fifth
division
was
not
completed
till
the
sixth
and
seventh
on
march
though
even
then
the
superiority
such
as
it
was
consisted
entirely
of
spanish
troops
of
doubtful
quality
of
wellington
as
a
tactician
we
have
already
had
occasion
to
speak
in
the
first
volume
of
this
work
it
is
only
necessary
to
repeat
here
that
the
groundwork
of
his
tactics
was
his
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
the
line
could
beat
the
column
whether
on
the
offensive
or
the
defensive
the
for
forming
the
conclusions
had
been
in
possession
of
any
one
who
chose
to
utilize
them
but
it
was
wellesley
who
put
his
knowledge
to
full
account
even
before
he
left
india
it
is
said
he
had
grasped
the
great
secret
and
had
remarked
to
his
confidants
that
the
french
were
sweeping
everything
before
them
in
europe
by
the
use
of
the
formation
in
column
but
that
he
was
fully
convinced
that
the
column
could
and
would
be
beaten
by
the
line
yet
even
though
the
yet
fight
of
maida
had
occurred
since
then
the
first
peninsular
battles
came
as
a
revelation
to
the
world
after
vimiero
and
talavera
it
became
known
that
the
line
was
certainly
superior
for
the
defensive
but
it
was
only
the
triumphant
of
salamanca
that
finally
divulged
the
fact
that
the
british
method
was
equally
sure
and
certain
for
the
attack
if
wellesley
s
reputation
rested
on
the
single
fact
that
he
had
made
this
discovery
known
to
the
world
he
would
have
won
by
this
alone
a
grand
place
in
military
history
but
his
reputation
depends
even
more
on
his
strategical
than
on
his
tactical
triumphs
he
was
a
of
the
first
rank
but
his
talents
on
the
day
of
decisive
action
would
not
have
sufficed
to
clear
the
french
out
of
spain
his
true
greatness
is
best
shown
by
his
grasp
of
the
political
geographical
and
moral
factors
of
the
situation
in
the
peninsula
and
by
the
way
in
which
he
utilized
them
all
when
drawing
up
the
plans
for
his
triumphant
campaigns
see
pp
of
vol
i
the
same
idea
is
well
marked
in
a
conversation
reported
by
croker
which
took
place
in
london
on
the
eve
of
wellesley
s
departure
to
assume
command
of
the
troops
at
cork
with
whom
he
was
about
to
sail
for
the
peninsula
after
a
long
reverie
he
was
asked
the
subject
of
his
thoughts
to
say
the
truth
he
replied
i
am
thinking
of
the
french
i
am
going
to
fight
i
have
not
seen
them
since
the
campaign
in
flanders
when
they
were
capital
soldiers
and
a
dozen
years
of
victory
under
buonaparte
must
have
made
them
better
still
they
have
besides
a
new
system
of
strategy
which
has
outmanœuvred
and
overwhelmed
all
the
armies
of
europe
tis
enough
to
make
one
thoughtful
but
no
matter
the
die
is
cast
they
may
overwhelm
me
but
i
don
t
think
they
will
outmanœuvre
me
first
because
i
am
not
afraid
of
them
as
everybody
else
seems
to
be
and
secondly
because
if
all
i
hear
of
their
system
be
true
i
think
it
a
false
one
against
steady
troops
i
suspect
all
the
continental
armies
are
half
beaten
before
the
battle
begins
i
at
least
will
not
be
frightened
croker
s
and
vol
under
the
date
june
as
to
tactics
indeed
there
are
points
on
which
it
would
be
easy
to
point
out
defects
in
wellesley
s
method
in
especial
it
would
be
possible
to
develop
the
two
old
but
none
the
less
true
criticisms
that
he
was
an
infantry
general
and
that
when
he
had
won
a
battle
he
did
not
always
utilize
his
success
to
the
full
legitimate
the
two
charges
hang
closely
together
for
the
one
defect
was
but
the
consequence
of
the
other
a
tendency
to
refrain
from
making
the
greatest
possible
use
of
his
cavalry
for
breaking
up
an
enemy
who
had
already
begun
to
give
ground
and
for
pursuing
him
when
he
was
well
on
the
run
was
the
natural
concomitant
of
a
predilection
for
the
use
of
infantry
in
the
winning
of
battles
if
napoleon
had
commanded
the
british
army
at
salamanca
marmont
s
troops
would
have
been
annihilated
by
a
rapid
cavalry
pursuit
instead
of
merely
scattered
if
wellington
had
commanded
the
french
army
in
the
campaign
it
is
reasonably
certain
that
hohenlöhe
s
broken
divisions
would
have
escaped
into
the
interior
instead
of
being
garnered
in
piecemeal
by
the
inexorable
and
untiring
chase
kept
up
by
the
french
horse
the
very
distrust
which
wellington
expressed
for
the
capacities
of
the
british
cavalry
who
after
all
were
admirable
troops
when
well
handled
is
but
an
illustration
of
the
fact
that
he
was
no
true
lover
of
the
mounted
arm
but
of
this
we
have
already
spoken
and
it
is
unnecessary
to
dwell
at
greater
length
on
his
minor
deficiencies
than
on
his
numerous
excellencies
on
the
day
of
battle
see
vol
a
far
more
serious
charge
against
wellesley
than
any
which
can
be
grounded
on
his
tactical
faults
is
that
though
he
won
the
confidence
of
his
army
he
could
never
win
their
affection
the
sight
of
his
long
nose
among
us
on
a
battle
morning
wrote
one
of
his
veterans
was
worth
ten
thousand
men
any
day
of
the
week
but
it
was
not
personal
attachment
to
him
which
nerved
his
soldiers
to
make
their
best
effort
he
was
feared
respected
and
followed
but
never
loved
he
was
obeyed
with
alacrity
but
not
with
enthusiasm
his
officers
and
his
men
believed
and
believed
rightly
that
he
looked
upon
them
as
admirable
tools
for
the
task
that
had
been
set
him
and
did
his
best
to
keep
those
tools
unbroken
and
in
good
repair
but
that
he
felt
no
deep
personal
interest
in
their
welfare
it
is
seldom
that
the
veterans
who
have
served
under
a
great
commander
have
failed
to
idolize
as
well
as
to
respect
him
but
wellesley
s
men
while
acknowledging
all
his
greatness
complained
that
he
systematically
neglected
both
their
feelings
and
their
interests
it
was
but
too
true
he
showed
for
his
army
the
officers
no
less
than
the
rank
and
file
a
certain
coldness
that
was
partly
bred
of
intellectual
contempt
partly
of
aristocratic
hauteur
there
are
words
of
his
on
record
concerning
his
men
which
can
never
be
forgiven
and
words
too
not
spoken
in
the
heat
of
action
or
the
moment
of
disappointment
but
in
the
leisure
of
his
later
years
take
for
example
the
passage
in
lord
stanhope
s
with
the
duke
of
where
he
is
speaking
of
the
rank
and
file
they
are
the
scum
of
the
earth
english
soldiers
are
fellows
who
have
enlisted
for
drink
that
is
the
plain
fact
they
have
enlisted
for
drink
he
described
the
men
who
won
talavera
as
a
rabble
who
could
not
bear
success
and
the
waterloo
troops
as
an
infamous
army
the
terms
are
unpardonable
his
notions
of
discipline
were
worthy
of
one
of
the
drill
sergeants
of
frederic
the
great
i
have
no
idea
of
any
great
effect
being
produced
on
british
soldiers
he
once
said
before
a
royal
commission
by
anything
but
the
fear
of
immediate
corporal
flogging
was
the
one
remedy
for
all
evils
and
he
declared
that
it
was
absolutely
impossible
to
manage
the
army
without
it
for
any
idea
of
appealing
to
the
men
s
better
feeling
or
moving
them
by
sentiment
he
had
the
greatest
contempt
see
kincaid
chap
v
may
the
feelings
expressed
more
or
less
clearly
in
a
hundred
memoirs
may
be
summed
up
in
a
paragraph
by
wm
grattan
of
the
in
his
parting
general
order
to
the
peninsular
army
he
told
us
that
he
would
never
cease
to
feel
the
warmest
interest
for
our
welfare
and
honour
how
this
promise
was
kept
every
one
knows
that
the
duke
of
wellington
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
perhaps
the
greatest
man
of
the
present
age
few
will
deny
but
that
he
neglected
the
interests
and
feelings
of
his
peninsular
army
as
a
body
is
beyond
all
question
and
were
he
in
his
grave
hundreds
of
voices
that
now
are
silent
would
echo
what
i
write
with
the
duke
of
the
most
distressing
feature
in
wellington
s
condemnation
of
the
character
of
his
soldiery
is
that
he
was
sinning
against
the
light
officers
of
less
note
but
of
greater
heart
were
appealing
to
the
patriotism
and
good
feeling
of
their
men
with
the
best
results
at
the
very
moment
that
wellesley
was
denouncing
them
as
soulless
clods
and
irreclaimable
drunkards
it
was
not
by
the
lash
that
regiments
like
donnellan
s
or
colborne
s
or
many
other
corps
of
the
peninsular
army
were
kept
together
the
reminiscences
of
the
napiers
and
many
other
regimental
officers
of
the
better
class
are
full
of
anecdotes
illustrating
the
virtues
of
the
rank
and
file
there
are
dozens
of
diaries
and
autobiographies
of
sergeants
and
privates
of
wellesley
s
old
divisions
which
prove
that
there
were
plenty
of
intelligent
sober
and
religious
men
in
the
ranks
it
is
only
necessary
to
cite
as
examples
the
books
of
surtees
anton
morris
and
donaldson
if
there
were
also
thousands
of
drunkards
and
reckless
brutes
in
the
service
the
blame
for
their
misdoings
must
fall
to
a
great
extent
on
the
system
under
which
they
were
trained
the
ruthless
mediaeval
cruelty
of
the
code
of
punishment
alone
will
account
for
half
the
ruffianism
of
the
army
it
is
often
forgotten
that
there
was
a
strong
religious
element
in
the
rank
and
file
of
the
peninsular
army
in
a
letter
from
cartaxo
wellington
mentions
with
no
great
pleasure
the
fact
that
there
were
three
separate
methodist
meetings
in
the
guards
brigade
alone
and
that
in
many
other
regiments
there
were
officers
who
were
accustomed
to
preach
and
pray
with
their
men
for
the
spiritual
experiences
of
a
sergeant
in
the
agonies
of
conversion
the
reader
may
consult
the
diary
of
surtees
of
the
during
the
year
the
same
indiscriminate
censure
which
wellesley
poured
on
his
men
he
often
vented
on
his
officers
denouncing
them
in
the
most
reckless
fashion
there
were
careless
colonels
and
stupid
subalterns
enough
under
him
but
what
can
excuse
such
sweeping
statements
as
that
when
i
give
an
order
to
an
officer
of
the
line
it
is
i
venture
to
say
a
hundred
to
one
against
its
being
done
at
all
or
for
his
circular
of
november
declaring
that
all
the
evils
of
the
burgos
retreat
were
due
to
the
habitual
inattention
of
the
officers
of
regiments
to
their
it
was
a
bitter
blow
to
the
officers
of
the
many
battalions
which
had
kept
their
order
and
discipline
to
find
themselves
confused
with
the
offending
corps
in
the
same
general
blast
of
censure
but
by
they
were
well
accustomed
to
such
slashing
criticism
on
the
part
of
their
commander
such
a
chief
could
not
win
the
sympathy
of
his
army
though
he
might
command
their
intellectual
respect
equally
unfortunate
were
his
autocratic
temper
and
his
unwillingness
to
concede
any
latitude
of
instructions
to
his
subordinates
features
in
his
character
which
effectually
prevented
him
from
forming
a
school
of
good
officers
capable
of
carrying
out
large
independent
operations
he
trained
admirable
generals
of
division
but
not
commanders
of
armies
for
he
always
insisted
on
keeping
the
details
of
operations
even
in
distant
parts
of
the
theatre
of
war
entirely
under
his
own
hand
his
preference
for
hill
as
a
commander
of
detached
corps
came
entirely
from
the
fact
that
he
could
trust
that
worthy
and
gallant
officer
to
make
no
movements
on
his
own
initiative
and
to
play
a
safe
waiting
game
which
gave
his
chief
no
anxiety
in
his
younger
days
while
serving
under
other
generals
wellesley
had
been
by
no
means
an
exponent
of
blind
obedience
or
unquestioning
deference
to
the
orders
of
his
superiors
but
when
placed
in
command
himself
he
was
autocratic
to
a
fault
he
was
prone
to
regard
any
criticism
of
his
directions
as
insubordination
he
preferred
a
lieutenant
on
whom
he
could
rely
for
a
literal
obedience
to
orders
to
another
of
more
active
brain
who
possessed
initiative
and
would
think
for
there
was
hardly
an
officer
in
the
peninsular
army
to
whom
he
would
grant
a
free
hand
even
in
the
carrying
out
of
comparatively
small
tasks
his
most
trusted
subordinates
were
liable
to
find
themselves
overwhelmed
with
rebukes
delivered
in
the
most
tempestuous
fashion
if
they
took
upon
themselves
to
issue
a
command
on
their
own
responsibility
even
when
the
great
chief
was
many
leagues
away
sometimes
when
their
inspirations
had
been
obviously
useful
and
successful
he
would
wind
up
his
harangue
not
with
an
expression
of
approval
but
with
a
recommendation
to
the
effect
that
matters
had
turned
out
all
right
but
they
must
never
again
act
without
orders
this
was
not
the
way
to
develop
their
strategical
abilities
or
to
secure
that
intelligent
which
is
more
valuable
than
blind
obedience
it
may
be
pleaded
in
wellesley
s
defence
that
at
the
commencement
of
the
war
he
had
many
stupid
and
discontented
officers
under
him
and
that
their
carpings
at
his
orders
were
often
as
absurd
as
they
were
malevolent
but
it
was
not
only
for
them
that
he
reserved
his
thunders
they
fell
not
unfrequently
on
able
and
willing
men
who
had
done
no
more
than
think
for
themselves
when
an
urgent
problem
had
been
presented
to
them
he
was
it
must
be
confessed
a
thankless
master
to
serve
he
was
almost
as
pitiless
as
frederic
the
great
in
resenting
a
mistake
or
an
apparent
disobedience
to
orders
the
case
of
norman
ramsay
may
serve
as
an
example
ramsay
was
perhaps
the
most
brilliant
artillery
officer
in
the
peninsular
army
the
famous
charge
of
his
guns
through
a
french
cavalry
regiment
at
fuentes
d
oñoro
is
one
of
the
exploits
of
the
whole
war
but
at
vittoria
he
made
an
error
in
comprehending
orders
and
moved
forward
from
a
village
where
the
had
intended
to
keep
him
stationed
he
was
placed
under
arrest
for
three
weeks
cut
out
of
his
mention
in
dispatches
and
deprived
of
the
which
had
been
promised
him
his
career
was
broken
and
two
years
later
he
fell
still
a
captain
at
waterloo
robert
craufurd
and
hill
were
perhaps
the
only
exceptions
take
for
example
his
behaviour
to
sir
james
macgrigor
perhaps
the
most
successful
of
his
chiefs
of
departments
macgrigor
being
at
salamanca
while
wellesley
was
at
madrid
ordered
on
his
own
authority
the
bringing
up
of
stores
for
the
mass
of
wounded
left
behind
there
after
the
battle
he
then
came
to
bring
his
report
to
madrid
lord
wellington
was
sitting
to
a
spanish
painter
goya
for
his
portrait
when
i
arrived
and
asked
me
to
sit
down
and
give
him
a
detail
as
to
the
state
of
the
wounded
at
salamanca
when
i
came
to
inform
him
that
for
their
relief
i
had
ordered
up
purveying
and
commissariat
officers
he
started
up
and
in
a
violent
manner
reprobated
what
i
had
done
his
lordship
was
in
a
passion
and
the
spanish
artist
ignorant
of
the
english
language
looked
aghast
and
at
a
loss
to
know
what
i
had
done
to
enrage
him
so
much
i
shall
be
glad
to
know
he
asked
who
is
to
command
the
army
i
or
you
i
establish
one
route
one
line
of
communications
for
the
army
you
establish
another
and
order
up
supplies
by
it
as
long
as
you
live
sir
never
do
that
again
never
do
without
my
i
pleaded
that
there
was
no
time
to
consult
him
and
that
i
had
to
save
lives
he
peremptorily
desired
me
never
again
to
act
without
his
a
month
later
i
was
able
to
say
to
him
my
lord
recollect
how
you
blamed
me
at
madrid
for
the
steps
which
i
took
on
coming
up
to
the
army
when
i
could
not
consult
your
lordship
and
acted
for
myself
now
if
i
had
not
what
would
the
consequences
have
been
he
answered
it
is
all
right
as
has
turned
out
but
i
recommend
you
still
have
my
orders
for
what
you
this
was
a
singular
feature
in
the
character
of
lord
macgrigor
s
pp
and
it
would
almost
seem
that
wellesley
had
worked
out
for
himself
some
sort
of
general
rule
to
the
effect
that
incompetent
being
more
common
than
competent
subordinates
it
would
be
safer
in
the
long
run
to
prohibit
all
use
of
personal
initiative
as
the
occasions
on
which
it
would
be
wisely
and
usefully
employed
would
be
less
numerous
than
those
on
which
it
would
result
in
blunders
and
perils
he
had
a
fine
intellectual
contempt
for
many
of
the
officers
whom
he
had
to
employ
and
never
shrank
from
showing
it
when
once
he
had
made
up
his
mind
he
could
not
listen
with
patience
to
advice
or
criticism
it
was
this
that
made
him
such
a
political
failure
in
his
latter
days
he
carried
into
the
cabinet
the
methods
of
the
camp
and
could
not
understand
why
they
were
resented
his
colleagues
started
up
with
crotchets
he
complained
i
have
not
been
used
to
that
in
the
early
part
of
my
life
i
was
accustomed
to
carry
on
things
in
quite
a
different
manner
i
assembled
my
officers
and
laid
down
my
plan
and
it
was
carried
into
effect
without
any
more
words
for
councils
of
war
or
other
devices
by
which
a
weak
endeavours
to
discharge
some
of
the
burden
of
responsibility
upon
the
shoulders
of
his
lieutenants
wellesley
had
the
greatest
dislike
he
never
allowed
discussion
as
long
as
he
held
supreme
authority
in
the
field
he
would
have
liked
to
enforce
the
same
rule
in
the
cabinet
when
he
became
prime
minister
of
england
sometimes
he
had
glimpses
of
the
fact
that
it
is
unwise
to
show
open
scorn
for
the
opinion
of
others
especially
when
they
are
men
of
influence
or
capacity
but
it
was
not
often
that
the
idea
occurred
to
him
his
reception
of
an
officer
who
came
with
a
petition
or
a
piece
of
advice
was
often
such
that
the
visitor
went
away
boiling
with
rage
or
prostrated
with
nervous
exhaustion

to
have

the

as

of

of

fact

addressed
to
me
a

on

subject

for
a
record
of
such
an
interview
by
an
see
gronow
s
one
morning
i
was
in
his
lordship
s
small
apartment
when
two
officers
were
there
to
request
leave
to
go
to
england
a
general
officer
of
a
noble
family
commanding
a
brigade
advanced
saying
my
lord
i
have
of
late
been
suffering
much
from
rheumatism
without
allowing
him
time
to
proceed
further
lord
wellington
rapidly
said
and
you
must
go
to

to
get
cured
of
it
by
all
means

there
the
general
surprised
at
his
lordship
s
tone
and
manner
looked
abashed
while
he
made
a
profound
bow
to
prevent
his
saying
anything
more
his
lordship
turned
to
address
me
inquiring
about
the
casualties
of
the
preceding
night
sir
james
macgrigor
s
pp
hardly
less
humiliating
to
many
of
wellesley
s
subordinates
than
personal
interviews
of
this
kind
were
the
letters
which
they
received
from
him
when
he
chanced
to
be
at
a
distance
he
had
not
the
art
probably
he
had
not
the
wish
to
conceal
the
fact
that
he
despised
as
well
as
disliked
many
of
those
whom
the
fortune
of
war
or
the
exigencies
of
home
patronage
placed
under
his
command
the
same
icy
intellectual
contempt
which
he
showed
for
the
needy
peers
the
grovelling
and
the
hungry
lawyers
of
dublin
when
he
was
for
ireland
pierces
through
many
of
his
letters
to
the
officers
of
the
army
of
portugal
very
frequently
his
mean
opinion
of
their
abilities
was
justifiable
but
there
was
no
need
to
let
it
appear
in
this
part
of
the
management
of
men
wellesley
was
deficient
he
failed
to
see
that
it
is
better
in
the
end
to
rule
subordinates
by
appealing
to
their
zeal
and
loyalty
than
to
their
fears
and
that
a
little
commendation
for
work
well
performed
goes
further
in
its
effect
on
an
army
than
much
censure
for
what
has
been
done
amiss
when
he
has
to
praise
his
officers
in
a
dispatch
the
terms
used
are
always
formal
and
official
in
the
extreme
it
is
the
rarest
thing
to
find
a
phrase
which
seems
to
come
from
the
heart
the
careful
reader
will
know
what
importance
to
attach
to
these
expressions
of
approval
when
he
notes
that
the
names
of
subordinates
whom
wellesley
despised
and
distrusted
are
inserted
all
in
due
order
of
seniority
between
those
of
the
men
who
had
really
done
the
work
all
have
to
give
vent
to
a
certain
amount
of
these
empty
and
meaningless
commendations
but
few
have
shown
more
neglect
in
discriminating
between
the
really
deserving
men
and
the
rest
than
did
the
victor
of
salamanca
and
waterloo
occasionally
this
carelessness
as
to
the
merits
and
the
feelings
of
others
took
the
form
of
gross
injustice
more
frequently
it
led
to
nothing
worse
than
a
complete
mystification
of
the
readers
of
the
dispatch
as
to
the
relative
merits
of
the
persons
mentioned
therein
he
honourably
mentioned
murray
in
his
oporto
dispatch
and
tripp
in
his
waterloo
dispatch
both
had
behaved
abominably
take
for
example
the
case
of
baring
of
the
at
waterloo
in
a
dispatch
not
written
immediately
after
the
battle
when
accurate
information
might
have
been
difficult
to
procure
but
later
wellesley
says
that
la
haye
sainte
was
taken
at
two
o
clock
through
the
negligence
of
the
officer
who
commanded
the
yet
if
anything
is
certain
it
is
that
baring
held
out
till
six
o
clock
that
his
nine
companies
of
the
kept
back
two
whole
french
divisions
and
that
when
he
was
driven
out
the
sole
cause
was
that
his
ammunition
was
exhausted
and
that
no
more
could
be
sent
him
because
the
enemy
had
completely
surrounded
the
post
if
wellington
had
taken
any
trouble
about
the
ascertaining
of
the
facts
he
could
not
have
failed
to
learn
the
truth
the
explanation
of
this
feature
in
wellesley
s
correspondence
is
a
fundamental
want
of
broad
sympathy
in
his
character
he
had
a
few
intimates
to
whom
he
spoke
freely
and
it
is
clear
that
he
often
showed
consideration
and
even
kindness
to
his
and
other
personal
retainers
there
were
one
or
two
of
his
relatives
to
whom
he
showed
an
unswerving
affection
and
whose
interests
were
always
near
his
heart
among
these
neither
his
wife
nor
his
elder
brother
richard
the
great
of
india
were
to
be
numbered
he
quarrelled
so
bitterly
with
the
latter
that
for
many
years
they
never
met
no
doubt
there
were
faults
on
both
sides
yet
wellington
might
have
borne
much
from
the
brother
who
started
him
on
his
career
but
for
him
the
position
of
resident
in
mysore
would
not
have
been
given
to
so
junior
an
officer
nor
would
the
command
of
the
army
that
won
assaye
and
argaum
have
been
placed
in
his
hands
it
is
small
wonder
that
the
grievances
and
petty
ambitions
of
the
average
line
officer
never
touched
the
heart
of
the
man
who
could
be
estranged
from
his
own
brother
by
a
secondary
political
question
see
especially
his
charming
letters
to
his
niece
lady
burghersh
lately
published
it
has
often
been
noted
that
when
the
wars
were
over
he
showed
little
predilection
for
the
company
of
his
old
peninsular
officers
some
of
his
most
trusted
subordinates
hardly
looked
upon
his
face
after
he
clearly
preferred
the
company
of
politicians
and
men
of
fashion
to
that
of
the
majority
of
his
old
generals
they
only
met
him
at
the
formal
festivity
of
the
annual
waterloo
banquet
the
remembrance
of
the
countless
panegyrics
upon
wellington
not
only
as
a
general
but
as
a
man
which
have
appeared
during
the
last
sixty
years
has
made
it
necessary
if
painful
to
speak
of
his
limitations
for
two
whole
generations
it
seemed
almost
treasonable
to
breathe
a
word
against
his
personal
character
so
great
was
the
debt
that
britain
owed
him
for
salamanca
and
waterloo
his
frigid
formalism
was
regarded
with
respect
and
even
admiration
his
lack
of
geniality
and
his
utter
inability
to
understand
the
sentimental
side
of
life
were
even
praised
as
signs
of
spartan
virtue
certain
episodes
which
did
not
fit
in
too
happily
with
the
spartan
hero
theory
were
deliberately
ignored
the
popular
conception
of
arthur
wellesley
has
been
largely
built
up
on
laudatory
sketches
written
by
those
who
knew
him
in
his
old
age
alone
he
lives
in
our
memories
as
a
kind
of
nestor
replete
with
useful
and
interesting
information
as
lord
stanhope
drew
him
in
his
with
the
duke
of
this
was
not
the
man
known
to
his
contemporaries
in
the
years
of
the
peninsular
war
his
relations
with
the
other
sex
were
numerous
and
unedifying
from
his
loveless
and
unwise
marriage
made
on
a
point
of
duty
where
affection
had
long
vanished
down
to
his
tedious
correspondence
with
miss
there
is
nothing
profitable
to
be
discovered
see
greville
s
series
iii
yet
there
was
much
to
admire
in
wellesley
s
personal
character
england
has
never
had
a
more
faithful
servant
though
intensely
ambitious
he
never
allowed
ambition
to
draw
him
aside
from
the
most
tedious
and
thankless
daily
tasks
when
once
convinced
that
it
was
his
duty
to
undertake
a
piece
of
work
he
carried
it
through
with
unswerving
industry
and
perseverance
if
not
always
with
much
tact
or
consideration
for
the
feelings
of
others
he
was
unsparing
of
himself
careless
of
praise
or
blame
honest
in
every
word
and
deed
he
was
equally
ready
to
offend
his
king
or
to
sacrifice
his
popularity
with
the
multitude
when
he
thought
that
he
had
to
face
a
question
in
which
right
and
wrong
were
involved
he
was
essentially
what
he
once
called
himself
using
a
familiar
hindustani
phrase
a
man
of
his
in
spite
of
all
his
faults
he
stands
out
a
majestic
figure
in
the
history
of
his
time
it
is
the
misfortune
of
the
historian
that
when
he
sees
so
much
to
admire
and
to
respect
he
finds
so
little
that
commands
either
sympathy
or
affection
when
we
read
wellington
s
interminable
controversies
with
the
portuguese
regency
and
the
spanish
junta
we
soon
come
to
understand
not
merely
the
way
in
which
they
provoked
him
by
their
tortuous
shuffling
and
their
helpless
procrastination
but
still
more
the
way
in
which
he
irritated
them
by
his
unveiled
scorn
and
his
outspoken
exposure
of
all
their
meannesses
a
little
more
diplomatic
language
would
have
secured
less
friction
and
probably
better
service

might

him

he
would
be

to
make
when

should

been

their
present
numbers
by

and
recent
drafts
from
the
militia
even
at
talavera
six
months
after
the
campaign
had
begun
it
is
on
record
that
many
of
the
men
were
still
showing
the
names
and
numbers
of
their
old
militia
regiments
on
their
knapsacks
the
battalions
which
had
joined
in
moore
s
march
into
spain
only
began
to
reappear
in
june
when
robert
craufurd
brought
back
to
lisbon
the
and
which
were
to
form
the
nucleus
of
the
famous
light
division
the
remainder
of
the
corunna
troops
when
they
had
been
rested
and
recruited
were
drawn
aside
to
take
part
in
the
miserable
expedition
to
walcheren
when
wellesley
first
took
the
field
therefore
these
veterans
of
the
campaign
of
were
only
represented
by
the
two
battalions
of
detachments
which
general
cameron
had
organized
from
the
stragglers
and
convalescents
of
moore
s
army
excluding
troops
that
arrived
at
lisbon
just
after

the
portuguese
troops
which
wellesley
found
available
for
the
campaign
against
soult
consisted
entirely
of
the
line
regiments
from
lisbon
and
the
central
parts
of
the
realm
which
beresford
had
been
reorganizing
during
the
last
two
months
the
troops
of
the
north
had
been
destroyed
at
oporto
or
were
in
arms
under
silveira
on
the
tamega
those
of
the
south
were
garrisoning
elvas
or
still
endeavouring
to
recruit
their
enfeebled
at
their
regimental
head
quarters
but
beresford
had
massed
at
thomar
and
abrantes
ten
line
regiments
some
with
one
some
with
their
statutory
two
battalions
three
newly
raised
battalions
of
cazadores
and
three
incomplete
cavalry
regiments
a
force
amounting
in
all
to
nearly
sabres
and
bayonets
though
wellesley
considered
that
they
cut
a
bad
figure
and
that
the
rank
and
file
were
poor
and
the
native
officers
worse
than
anything
he
had
ever
seen
he
was
yet
resolved
to
give
them
a
chance
in
the
field
beresford
assured
him
that
they
had
improved
so
much
during
the
last
few
weeks
and
were
showing
such
zeal
and
good
spirit
that
it
was
only
fair
that
they
should
be
given
a
trial
these
regiments
were
the
raised
respectively
at
lisbon
estremoz
setubal
peniche
villa
viciosa
cascaes
campomayor
the
and
cazadores
and
and
cavalry
it
is
fair
to
the
portuguese
to
note
that
other
witnesses
of
may
speak
much
more
favourably
of
them
londonderry
writes
that
they
had
applied
of
late
so
much
ardour
to
their
military
education
that
some
were
already
fit
to
take
the
field
and
it
only
required
a
little
experience
to
put
them
on
a
level
with
the
best
troops
in
europe
there
was
one
brigade
under
general
campbell
the
and
regiments
which
struck
me
as
being
in
the
finest
possible
order
it
went
through
a
variety
of
evolutions
with
a
precision
and
correctness
which
would
have
done
no
discredit
to
our
own
accordingly
wellesley
resolved
to
brigade
certain
picked
battalions
among
his
english
troops
and
to
take
them
straight
to
the
front
while
he
told
off
others
to
form
part
of
the
containing
force
which
was
to
be
sent
off
to
watch
victor
and
the
french
army
of
estremadura
the
remainder
under
beresford
himself
were
to
act
as
an
independent
division
during
the
march
on
oporto
five
days
of
unceasing
work
had
to
be
spent
in
lisbon
before
wellesley
could
go
forward
but
while
he
was
making
his
arrangements
with
the
portuguese
regency
drawing
out
a
new
organization
for
beresford
s
commissariat
and
striving
to
get
into
communication
with
cuesta
the
british
troops
were
already
being
pushed
forward
from
leiria
towards
coimbra
and
the
portuguese
were
converging
from
thomar
on
the
same
point
so
that
no
time
was
being
lost
it
was
during
this
short
and
busy
stay
at
lisbon
that
wellesley
was
confronted
with
the
conspirator
argenton
who
had
come
up
to
the
capital
in
company
with
major
douglas
he
did
not
make
a
good
impression
on
the
who
wrote
home
that
he
had
no
doubt
as
to
the
reality
of
the
plot
against
soult
and
the
discontent
of
the
french
army
but
thought
it
unlikely
that
any
good
would
come
from
the
plot
he
refused
to
promise
compliance
with
argenton
s
two
requests
that
he
would
direct
the
portuguese
to
fall
in
with
soult
s
plans
for
assuming
royal
power
and
that
he
would
bring
the
british
army
forward
to
a
position
in
which
it
would
threaten
the
retreat
of
the
corps
on
leon
the
former
savoured
too
much
of
machiavellian
treachery
as
to
the
latter
he
thought
so
little
of
the
profit
likely
to
result
from
the
plot
that
he
would
not
alter
his
plans
to
oblige
the
conspirators
the
only
information
of
certain
value
that
he
had
obtained
from
the
emissary
was
that
soult
had
no
idea
of
victor
s
position
or
projects
all
that
he
granted
to
argenton
was
passports
to
take
him
and
his
two
friends
captains
dupont
and
garis
to
england
from
whence
they
intended
to
cross
into
france
in
order
to
set
their
friends
in
the
interior
on
the
move
great
care
was
taken
that
argenton
on
his
return
journey
to
oporto
should
see
as
little
as
possible
of
the
british
army
lest
he
should
be
able
to
tell
too
much
about
its
numbers
and
dispositions
he
was
conducted
back
by
douglas
to
the
vouga
by
a
circuitous
route
and
safely
repassed
franceschi
s
outposts
iv
to
castlereagh
wellesley
says
that
the
plot
will
probably
fail
and
that
even
if
the
corps
mutinied
they
would
not
carry
away
the
other
french
armies
as
argenton
hoped
he
had
therefore
refused
to
commit
himself
to
anything
ii
on
the
wellesley
at
last
got
clear
of
lisbon
where
the
formal
festivities
and
reception
arranged
in
his
honour
had
tried
him
even
more
than
the
incessant
which
had
to
be
got
through
before
the
organization
of
his
base
for
supplies
was
completed
on
april
he
pushed
forward
to
leiria
on
may
to
pombal
on
the
second
he
reached
coimbra
and
found
himself
in
the
midst
of
his
army
which
had
only
concentrated
itself
at
that
city
during
the
last
five
days
all
was
quiet
in
the
front
trant
who
was
holding
the
line
of
the
vouga
with
disorderly
militia
and
some
small
fragments
rallied
from
the
line
regiments
which
had
been
dispersed
at
oporto
reported
that
franceschi
and
the
french
light
cavalry
had
remained
quiescent
for
many
days
the
same
news
came
in
from
wilson
who
after
pursuing
lapisse
to
alcantara
had
come
back
with
part
of
his
troops
to
the
neighbourhood
of
almeida
and
had
a
detachment
at
vizeu
watching
the
flank
of
the
french
advance
silveira
reported
from
amarante
that
he
was
still
holding
the
line
of
the
tamega
and
had
at
least
enemies
in
front
of
him
all
therefore
seemed
propitious
for
the
great
stroke
wellesley
s
plan
as
finally
worked
out
in
detail
was
to
push
forward
his
main
body
upon
oporto
with
all
possible
speed
while
sending
a
flanking
column
under
beresford
to
cross
the
douro
near
lamego
join
silveira
and
intercept
soult
s
line
of
retreat
upon
the
plains
of
leon
by
way
of
the
if
he
could
move
fast
enough
he
hoped
to
catch
the
marshal
with
his
army
still
unconcentrated
his
design
as
he
wrote
to
castlereagh
was
to
beat
or
cripple
soult
to
thrust
him
back
into
galicia
he
doubted
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
accomplish
more
with
the
force
that
was
at
his
disposal
but
if
any
chance
should
occur
for
destroying
or
surrounding
the
enemy
he
would
do
his
best
rumours
that
the
marshal
was
preparing
to
evacuate
oporto
were
in
the
air
if
they
were
true
and
the
french
were
already
making
ready
to
retreat
it
was
unlikely
that
they
would
stand
long
enough
to
run
into
danger
the
detailed
arrangements
for
the
distribution
of
the
troops
were
as
follows
it
was
first
necessary
to
provide
a
containing
force
to
hold
back
victor
in
case
he
should
make
an
unexpected
move
down
the
tagus
or
the
guadiana
for
this
purpose
wellesley
told
off
one
of
his
brigades
that
of
mackenzie
together
with
two
regiments
of
heavy
cavalry
and
one
of
infantry
which
had
lately
arrived
at
lisbon
and
were
now
on
their
march
to
santarem
with
these
four
battalions
one
field
battery
and
eight
squadrons
mackenzie
was
to
take
post
at
abrantes
and
behind
the
line
of
the
zezere
there
he
was
to
be
joined
by
the
larger
half
of
beresford
s
reorganized
portuguese
army
seven
battalions
of
line
troops
three
of
cazadores
five
squadrons
of
cavalry
and
three
batteries
he
would
also
have
three
regiments
of
militia
at
his
disposal
to
garrison
the
fortress
of
abrantes
his
whole
force
excluding
the
militia
would
amount
to
british
and
portuguese
cavalry
nearly
british
infantry
portuguese
infantry
and
four
batteries
these
men
ought
to
be
able
to
hold
back
any
force
that
victor
could
detach
for
a
raid
along
the
tagus
for
having
cuesta
s
army
in
his
front
it
was
absolutely
impossible
that
he
could
march
with
his
whole
corps
into
portugal
if
the
marshal
moved
forward
south
of
the
tagus
that
river
should
be
held
against
him
and
since
it
was
in
full
flood
it
would
be
easy
to
keep
him
back
as
all
the
boats
and
ferries
could
be
destroyed
and
it
would
be
useless
for
him
to
present
himself
opposite
vella
velha
abrantes
or
santarem
if
he
advanced
north
of
the
tagus
the
line
of
the
zezere
was
to
be
maintained
against
him
as
long
as
possible
then
those
of
the
nabao
and
rio
mayor
but
the
main
army
would
be
back
from
the
north
to
reinforce
the
containing
force
long
ere
the
marshal
could
push
so
far
as
an
outlying
post
on
this
front
wellesley
ordered
colonel
mayne
with
the
part
of
wilson
s
lusitanian
legion
that
had
not
returned
to
the
north
and
a
militia

occupy

he
was
to
break

after
deducting
the
sick
the

on

duty
and
one

he
divided
them
as
we
have
already
stated
into
a
larger
force
destined
to
execute
the
frontal
attack
upon
soult
and
a
smaller
one
which
was
to
cut
off
his
retreat
into
central
spain
the
flanking
column

in

a

british

the
of

with

and

these

were
originally
directed
to
join
silveira
at
amarante
and
with
him
in
defending
the
line
of
the
tamega
but
on
may
there
arrived
at
coimbra
the
unwelcome
news
that
loison
had
forced
the
bridge
of
amarante
and
that
silveira
in
consequence
had
retired
south
of
the
douro
and
was
lying
at
lamego
with
the
wrecks
of
his
army
some
men
at
most
this
untoward
event
did
not
cause
wellesley
to
change
the
direction
of
beresford
s
column
but
rendered
him
more
cautious
as
to
pushing
it
beyond
the
douro
he
ordered
his
lieutenant
to
pick
up
sir
robert
wilson
s
small
force
at
vizeu
to
join
silveira
at
lamego
and
then
to
guide
his
further
operations
by
the
attitude
of
the
french
if
they
tried
to
pass
the
douro
he
was
to
oppose
them
strenuously
if
they
still
clung
to
the
northern
bank
and
had
not
advanced
far
beyond
amarante
he
might
cross
and
occupy
villa
real
if
he
thought
the
move
safe
and
the
position
behind
that
town
defensible
but
he
was
to
risk
nothing
if
the
whole
of
soult
s
corps
should
retreat
eastward
he
was
not
to
attempt
to
stop
them
for
wrote
wellesley
i
should
not
like
to
see
a
single
british
brigade
supported
by
or
portuguese
exposed
to
be
attacked
by
the
french
army
in
any
but
a
very
good
post
if
loison
alone
were
left
on
the
tamega
beresford
might
take
post
at
villa
real
and
fight
if
however
soult
should
appear
at
the
head
of
his
entire
force
it
would
be
madness
to
await
him
the
column
must
fall
back
and
allow
him
to
pass
remember
added
wellesley
in
another
letter
that
you
are

do
not
undertake
anything

and

of
whom
not
more
than
were
in

and
that
over
of
the

were
untried
and
levies
it
can
not
be
denied
that
the
march
on
oporto
showed
considerable
and
a
very
nice
and
accurate
calculation
of
the
chances
of
war
on
the
part
of
the
british
on
the
very
day
on
which
the
vanguard
marched
out
from
coimbra
upon
the
northern
road
wellesley
received
a
second
visit
from
the
conspirator
argenton
who
had
returned
from
consulting
his
friends
at
oporto
and
amarante
he
brought
little
news
of
importance
soult
had
not
yet
proclaimed
himself
king
and
therefore
the
plotters
had
taken
no
open
steps
against
him
the
french
army
had
not
begun
to
move
but
it
appeared
that
the
marshal
was
pondering
over
the
relative
advantages
of
the
lines
of
retreat
available
to
him
for
argenton
brought
a
memorandum
given
him
by
or
purloined
from
some
which
contained
a
long
exposition
of
the
various
roads
from
oporto
and
stated
a
preference
for
that
by
villa
real
and
the
he
had
a
number
of
futile
propositions
to
lay
before
wellesley
and
especially
urged
him
to
make
sure
of
villa
real
and
to
cut
off
the
marshal
s
retreat
on
spain
the
traitor
was
sent
back
with
no
promises
of
compliance
and
every
endeavour
was
made
to
keep
from
him
the
fact
that
the
allied
army
was
already
upon
the
move
unfortunately
he
had
passed
many
troops
upon
the
road
from
coimbra
to
the
vouga
and
had
guessed
at
what
he
had
not
seen
on
the
following
day
he
passed
through
the
french
lines
on
his
return
journey
and
by
the
way
endeavoured
to
spread
the
propaganda
of
treason
one
of
the
infantry
brigades
which
lay
in
support
of
franceschi
s
cavalry
was
commanded
by
a
general
lefebvre
with
whom
argenton
had
long
served
as
knowing
that
his
old
chief
was
weak
and
discontented
the
emissary
of
the
malcontents
paid
a
midnight
visit
to
him
revealed
to
him
the
outlines
of
the
conspiracy
and
endeavoured
to
enroll
him
as
a
fellow
plotter
he
had
misjudged
his
man
lefebvre
listened
to
everything
without
showing
any
signs
of
surprise
or
anger
but
hastened
to
bear
the
tale
to
soult
and
arranged
for
argenton
s
arrest
on
his
return
to
oporto
upon
the
following
morning
confronted
with
the
marshal
the
traitor
held
his
head
high
and
boasted
that
he
was
the
agent
of
a
powerful
body
of
conspirators
he
invited
soult
to
declare
against
the
emperor
and
deliver
france
from
servitude
he
also
warned
him
that
wellesley
had
arrived
at
coimbra
and
told
him
that
british
troops
of
whom
at
least
were
cavalry
would
fall
upon
franceschi
that
day
thus
owing
to
his
conference
with
argenton
wellesley
lost
the
chance
of
surprising
soult
who
was
warned
of
the
oncoming
storm
exactly
at
the
moment
when
it
was
most
important
that
he
should
still
be
kept
in
the
dark
as
to
the
force
that
was
marching
against
him
may
wellington
to
beresford
from
coimbra
may
he
told
wellesley
that
the
general
was
a
man
of
weak
intellect
and
that
he
thought
that
he
had
won
him
over
to
the
plot
from
the
way
in
which
he
received
the
news
of
it
wellesley
to
castlereagh
may
from
oporto
soult
sent
back
argenton
to
his
prison
after
threatening
him
with
death
but
uncertain
as
to
the
number
of
the
conspirators
he
was
thrown
for
a
moment
into
a
state
of
doubt
and
alarm
he
probably
suspected
loison
and
lahoussaye
of
being
in
the
plot
against
him
as
well
as
the
real
traitors
possibly
mermet
also
feeling
the
ground
as
it
were
trembling
beneath
his
feet
he
began
to
make
instant
preparations
for
retreat
orders
were
sent
to
franceschi
to
fall
back
on
oporto
and
not
to
risk
anything
by
an
attempt
to
hold
off
wellesley
longer
than
was
prudent
loison
was
informed
that
he
must
clear
the
road
beyond
amarante
as
the
army
was
about
to
retire
by
the
and
he
would
now
form
its
advanced
guard
lorges
at
braga
was
directed
to
gather
in
the
small
fractions
of
heudelet
s
division
which
had
been
left
at
viana
and
other
places
in
the
north
and
to
march
in
their
company
upon
amarante
by
the
way
of
guimaraens
the
marshal
saw
with
some
dismay
that
these
isolated
detachments
would
not
be
able
to
join
the
main
body
till
the
fourteenth
or
fifteenth
of
may
it
was
necessary
to
hold
oporto
as
long
as
possible
in
order
to
give
them
time
to
come
up
this
may
be
perhaps
inferred
from
soult
s
letter
to
king
joseph
written
after
the
retreat
in
which
he
says
that
he
had
intended
to
pack
off
lahoussaye
and
mermet
from
the
front

next

soult
contrived
to
extort
some
more
information
from
the
unstable
argenton
receiving
a
promise
of
life
for
himself
and
pardon
for
his
fellow
conspirators
which
the
marshal
apparently
granted
because
he
thought
that
accurate
information
concerning
the
plot
would
be
worth
more
to
him
than
the
right
to
shoot
the
plotters
the
captain
gave
up
the
names
of
all
the
leaders
much
relieved
to
find
that
none
of
his
generals
were
implicated
soult
did
no
more
than
arrest
the
two
colonels
lafitte
and
donadieu
leaving
the
smaller
fry
untouched
he
kept
his
promise
to
argenton
by
hushing
up
the
whole
matter
the
colonels
suffered
no
harm
beyond
their
arrest
argenton
escaped
from
custody
probably
by
collusion
with
the
officer
placed
in
charge
of
his
person
and
got
back
to
the
english
lines
the
day
after
the
capture
of
oporto
some
months
later
he
secretly
revisited
france
was
recognized
captured
and
shot
on
the
plain
of
grenelle
soult
so
far
managed
to
forget
the
whole
business
that
he
two
years
later
sent
the
younger
lafitte
to
present
to
the
emperor
the
english
flags
captured
at
albuera
see
chamans
p
most
of
this
comes
from
argenton
s
confession
to
wellesley
on
may
see
iv
he
said
that
he
slipped
away
from
the
gendarmes
at
the
advice
of
lafitte
who
told
him
that
his
friends
would
come
to
no
harm
if
the
chief
witness
against
them
vanished
the
extraordinary
clemency
shown
to
the
conspirators
by
soult
the
providential
escape
of
argenton
the
favours
which
the
marshal
afterwards
lavished
on
lafitte
and
the
trouble
which
he
took
to
hush
up
the
whole
matter
led
many
of
his
enemies
to
suspect
that
he
himself
had
been
in
the
plot
and
had
intended
to
combine
his
scheme
for
portuguese
kingship
with
a
rising
against
bonaparte
at
the
head
of
his
d
argenton
s
confession
made
this
impossible
for
further
details
on
argenton
s
fate
see
the
appendix
at
the
very
moment
when
soult
was
argenton
issuing
hurried
orders
for
the
concentration
of
his
troops
and
preparing
for
a
retreat
upon
amarante
wellesley
s
advanced
guard
was
drawing
near
the
vouga
and
making
ready
to
pounce
upon
franceschi
two
roads
lead
northward
from
coimbra
the
main
to
oporto
which
runs
inland
via
ponte
de

and
feira
and
a
minor
route
near
the
coast
which
passes
by
aveiro
and
ovar
five
of
wellesley
s
brigades
and
the
whole
of
his
cavalry
marched
by
the
former
route
moving
forward
under
the
screen
of
trant
s
militia
which
still
held
the
line
of
the
vouga
they
were
to
fall
on
the
enemy
s
front
at
dawn
on
may
the
five
squadrons
of

under

followed

the
two
brigades
of
murray
and
richard
stewart
sherbrooke
s
column
marched
in
support
ten
miles
to
the
rear
it
was
intended
that
the
whole
mass
should
rush
in
upon
franceschi
s
pickets
and
roll
them
in
upon
his
main
body
before
the
advance
from
coimbra
was
suspected
unhappily
soult
had
already
warned
his
cavalry
commander
of
the
coming
storm
upon
the
ninth
and
he
was
not
caught
unprepared
meanwhile
the
remaining
two
infantry
brigades
of
wellesley
s
army
those
of
hill
and
cameron
were
to
execute
a
turning
movement
against
franceschi
s
flank
orders
had
been
sent
to
the
magistrates
of
the
town
of
aveiro
bidding
them
collect
all
the
which
were
to
be
found
in
the
great
lagoon
at
the
mouth
of
the

broad
sheet
of
shallow
water
and
sandbanks
which
extends
for
fifteen
miles
parallel
to

from
it
by
a
narrow
spit
of
dry
ground
at
the
northern
end
of
this
system
of
inland
waterways
is
the
town
of
ovar
which
lay
far
behind
franceschi
s
rear
hill
was
directed
to
ship
his
men
upon
the
boats
and
to
throw
them
ashore
at
ovar
where
they
were
to
fall
upon
the
flank
of
the
french
when
they
should
be
driven
past
them
by
the
frontal
advance
of
the
main
body
if
all
had
gone
well
the
french
detachment
might
have
been
annihilated
franceschi
had
with
him
no
more
than
the
four
weak
cavalry
regiments
of
his
own
division
not
more
than
sabres
with
one
light
battery
and
a
single
regiment
of
infantry
but
not
far
behind
him
was
the
rest
of
mermet
s
division
eleven
battalions
of
infantry
with
a
strength
of
some
men
one

on
the
night
of

ninth
the
british

reached
the

after
only
a
few
hours
repose
the
cavalry
mounted
again
at
and
pushed
forward
in
order
to
fall
upon
the
enemy
at
daybreak
the
night
march
turned
out
a
failure
as
such
enterprises
often
do
in
an
unexplored
seamed
with
rocks
and
ravines
the
rear
of
the
cavalry
column
got
astray
and
fell
far
behind
the
leading
squadrons
much
time
was
lost
in
marching
and
countermarching
and
at
dawn
the
brigade
found
itself
still
some
way
from
albergaria
nova
the
village
where
franceschi
s
head
quarters
were
established
it
was
already
five
o
clock
when
they
fell
in
with
and
drove
back
the
french
outlying
pickets
shortly
after
they
came
upon
the
whole
of
franceschi
s
division
drawn
out
in
battle
array
on
a
rough
moor
behind
the

with
a
few
companies
of
infantry
placed
in
a
wood
on
their
flank
and
their
battery
in

of
their
line
general
cotton
saw
that
there
was
no
chance
of
a
surprise
and
very
wisely
declined
to
attack
a
slightly
superior
force
of
all
arms
with
the
sabres
of
his
two
regiments
he
resolved
to
wait
for
the
arrival
of

brigade
the
leading
part
of
the
main
column
when
franceschi
advanced
against
him
he
refused
to
fight
and
drew
back
a
little
thus
some
hours
of
the
morning
were
wasted
till
at
last
there
arrived
on

and
a
battalion
of

followed
by

and
the
battalion
of
detachments
like
the

the
infantry
had
been
much
delayed
during
the
hours
of

mainly
by
the
impossibility
of
getting
the
guns
up
the
rocky
defile
beyond

where
several
caissons
had
broken
down
in

it
was
only
after

of
boats
enough
to
carry
men
at
a
trip
during
the
night
of
the
the
flotilla
was
engaged
in
sailing
up
the
long
lagoon
which
leads
to
ovar
it
was
quite
early
in
the
morning
when
the
brigade
came
to
land
and
if
franceschi
had
been
driven
in
at
an
early
hour
he
would
have
found
hill
in
a
most
threatening
position
on
his
flank
but
the
french
cavalry
was
still
ten
or
twelve
miles
away
engaged
in
its
bloodless
demonstration
against
cotton
s
brigade
finding
from
the
peasants
that
there
were
french
infantry
encamped
quite
close
to
him
at
feira
and
that
the
english
main
column
was
still
at
a
distance
hill
kept
his
men
within
the
walls
of
ovar
instead
of
engaging
in
an
attempt
to
intercept
franceschi
s
retreat
he
was
probably
quite
right
as
it
would
have
been
dangerous
to
thrust
three
battalions
without
cavalry
or
guns
between
mermet
s
troops
at
feira
and
the
retiring
columns
of
the
french
horsemen
hill
therefore
sent
back
his
boats
to
bring
up
cameron
s
brigade
from
aveiro
and
remained
quiet
all
the
morning
at
noon
his
pickets
were
driven
in
by
french
infantry
mermet
had
at
last
heard
of
his
arrival
and
had
sent
out
the
three
battalions
of
the
léger
from
feira
to
contain
him
and
protect
franceschi
s
flank
the
companies
of
this
force
pressed
in
upon
hill
but
would
not
adventure
themselves
too
far
the
afternoon
was
spent
in
futile
skirmishing
but
at
last
the
retreating
french
cavalry
went
by
at
a
great
pace
and
the
english
light
dragoons
following
them
in
hot
pursuit
came
up
with
the
léger
hill
seeing
himself
once
more
in
touch
with
his
friends
now
pushed
out
of
ovar
in
force
and
pressed
on
the
french
companies
which
hastily
retired
fell
back
on
their
regiment
and
ultimately
retired
with
it
and
rejoined
mermet
s
main
body
on
the
heights
above
grijon
the
skirmishing
had
been
almost
bloodless
hill
lost
not
a
single
man
and
the
french
infantry
only
wounded
the
best
account
of
this
little
skirmish
is
in
the
of
fantin
des
odoards
of
the
léger
napier
does
not
mention
that
the
reason
why
hill
did
not
move
in
the
afternoon
was
simply
that
he
was
already
contained
and
engaged
with
a
force
of
french
infantry
of
nearly
his
own
strength
on
the
morning
of
may
therefore
hill
s
troops
on
the
left
and
cotton
s
and
paget
s
on
the
right
lay
opposite
the
position
which
mermet
and
franceschi
had
taken
up
sherbrooke
was
still
more
than
ten
miles
to
the
rear
having
barely
crossed
the
vouga
while
cameron
had
not
yet
sailed
up
from
aveiro
wellesley
had
therefore
some
cavalry
and
infantry
under
his
hand
with
which
to
assail
the
horse
and
foot
of
the
two
french
divisions
the
enemy
were
strongly
posted
grijon
lies
in
a
valley
with
woods
and
orchards
around
it
and
a
steep
hillside
at
its
back
the
french
held
the
village
and
the
slopes
on
each
side
of
it
behind
them
the
fifteen
battalions
of
mermet
were
partly
visible
among
the
trees
on
the
of
the
heights
wellesley
was
anxious
to
see
whether
the
enemy
intended
to
hold
his
ground
or
would
retire
before
a
demonstration
he
therefore
threw
the
light
companies
of
richard
stewart
s
brigade
into
the
woods
on
each
side
of
grijon
a
furious
fire
at
once
broke
out
and
the
advancing
line
of
skirmishers
could
make
no
headway
realizing
that
the
french
intended
to
fight
a
serious
rearguard
action
wellesley
refused
to
indulge
them
with
a
frontal
attack
and
determined
to
turn
both
their
flanks
while
cotton
s
cavalry
and
the
two
english
battalions
of
stewart
s
brigade
drew
up
opposite
their
centre
murray
s
germans
marched
off
to
the
left
to
get
beyond
mermet
s
flank
while
colonel
doyle
with
the
battalion
of
the
portuguese
which
belonged
to
stewart
s
brigade
entered
the
woods
on
the
extreme
right
hill
s
brigade
a
mile
or
two
to
the
left
of
murray
pushed
forward
on
the
road
at
a
rate
which
would
soon
have
brought
them
far
beyond
the
enemy
s
rear
the
meaning
of
these
movements
was
not
long
hidden
from
the
french
the
and
battalions
of
the
king
s
german
legion
led
by
brigadier
langwerth
were
soon
pressing
upon
their
right
flank
while
the
portuguese
battalion
plunged
into
the
woods
on
the
other
wing
with
great
resolution
wellesley
himself
was
watching
this
part
of
the
advance
with
much
interest
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
sent
his
native
allies
into
the
firing
line
and
he
was
anxious
to
see
how
they
would
behave
they
surpassed
his
expectations
the
was
a
good
regiment
with
a
number
of
students
of
the
university
of
coimbra
in
its
ranks
they
plunged
into
the
thickets
without
a
moment
s
hesitation
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
retiring
sound
of
the
musketry
showed
that
they
were
making
headway
in
the
most
promising
style
this
sight
was
an
enormous
relief
to
the
if
the
portuguese
could
be
trusted
in
line
of
battle
his
task
became
immeasurably
more
easy
you
are
in
error
in
supposing
that
these
troops
will
not
fight
he
wrote
to
a
correspondent
one
battalion
has
behaved
remarkably
well
under
my
own
eyes
wellesley
to
mackenzie
the
latter
had
written
that
he
dared
not
trust
his
portuguese
battalions
iv
mermet
and
franceschi
did
not
hesitate
for
long
when
they
saw
their
flank
guard
beaten
in
upon
either
side
and
heard
that
hill
was
marching
upon
their
rear
they
gave
orders
for
their
whole
line
to
retire
without
delay
the
plateau
behind
them
was
so
cut
up
with
stone
walls
enclosing
fields
that
the
cavalry
could
be
of
no
use
in
covering
the
retreat
so
franceschi
went
to
the
rear
first
at
a
round
trot
mermet
followed
leaving
the
three
battalions
of
the
léger
to
act
as
a
rearguard
see
fantin
des
odoards
le
noble
incorrect
as
always
says
that
the
brought
up
the
rear
the
whole
british
line
now
pressed
in
as
fast
as
was
possible
in
the
woods
and
lanes
the
infantry
could
never
overtake
the
enemy
but
two
squadrons
of
the
and
light
dragoons
galloping
along
the
high
road
came
up
with
mermet
s
rear
a
mile
beyond
the
brow
of
the
hill
charles
stewart
who
was
leading
them
on
was
one
of
those
cavalry
officers
who
thoroughly
believe
in
their
arm
and
think
that
it
can
go
anywhere
and
do
anything
he
at
once
ordered
major
blake
of
the
to
charge
the
enemy
though
the
french
were
retiring
along
a
narrow
bordered
with
stone
walls
fortunately
for
the
dragoons
their
opponents
were
already
shaken
in
the
three
battalions
were
not
well
together
isolated
companies
were
still
coming
in
from
the
flanks
and
the
colonel
of
the
had
completely
lost
his
head
on
being
charged
the
rearguard
fired
a
volley
which
brought
down
the
front
files
of
the
pursuing
cavalry
but
then
wavered
broke
and
began
scrambling
over
the
walls
to
escape
out
of
the
high
road
into
the
fields
there
followed
a
confused
for
the
english
dragoons
also
leaped
the
walls
and
tried
to
follow
the
broken
enemy
among
thickets
and
ploughland
of
those
of
the
french
who
fled
down
the
high
road
many
were
sabred
and
a
considerable
number
captured
indeed
the
eagle
of
the
regiment
was
in
considerable
danger
for
some
time
but
the
british
had
no
supports
at
hand
they
scattered
in
reckless
pursuit
of
the
men
who
had
taken
to
the
fields
and
many
were
shot
down
when
they
had
got
entangled
among
trees
and
walls
however
the
charge
if
somewhat
reckless
was
on
the
whole
successful
the
dragoons
lost
no
more
than
ten
killed
one
officer
and
thirty
troopers
wounded
with
eight
or
ten
missing
while
the
french
regiment
into
which
they
had
burst
left
behind
it
over
prisoners
and
nearly
as
many
killed
and
wounded
there
are
two
excellent
accounts
of
this
charge
in
the
diaries
of
tomkinson
of
the
light
dragoons
and
fantin
des
odoards
of
the
léger
the
former
pp
holds
that
the
charge
was
indefensible
and
blames
charles
stewart
for
ordering
it
and
major
blake
for
carrying
it
out
a
different
impression
is
received
from
the
french
diarist
who
speaks
of
it
as
a
complete
rout
of
his
regiment
and
very
disastrous
assaillis
en
détail
nous
avons
été
facilement
mis
en
désordre
attendu
notre
morcellement
et
la
confusion
que
des
charges
audacieuses
de
cavalerie
mettaient
dans
nos
rangs
les
trois
bataillons
ont
lâché
pied
et
se
sont
enfuis
à
vau
de
route
si
le
pays
n
avait
pas
offert
des
murs
des
fossés
et
des
haies
ils
auraient
été
entièrement
sabrés
peu
à
peu
les
débris
du

sont
ralliés
a
la
division
qui
était
en
position
à
une
lieue
de

notre
perte

été
considérable
mais
notre
aigle
qui
a
couru
de
grands
dangers
dans
cette
bagarre
a
fort
heureusement

les

étaient
acharnés
a

poursuivre
et
mal
a
pris
ceux
qui
au
lieu
de
gagner
les
collines
out
suivi
le
vallon
et
la
grande
route
it
seems
probable
a
thing
extremely
rare
in
military
history
that
tomkinson
and
des
odoards
the
two
best
narrators
of
the
fight
actually
met
each
other
the
former
mentions
that
he
chased
an
isolated
french
infantry
man
fired
his
pistol
at
his
head
but
missed
and
that
he
was
at
once
shot
in
the
shoulder
by
another
frenchman
and
disabled
then
turning
back
he
was
again
fired
at
by
several
men
and
brought
down
des
odoards
says
that
he
was
chased
by
a
single
english
dragoon
who
got
up
to
him
fired
at
him
point
blank
and
missed
whereupon
a
corporal
of
his
company
who
had
turned
back
to
help
him
shot
the
dragoon
who
dropped
his
smoking
pistol
at
des
odoards
feet
and
rolled
off
his
horse
the
narratives
seem
to
tally
perfectly
for
the
rest
of
the
day
mermet
and
franceschi
continued
to
fall
back
before
the
advancing
british
without
making
more
than
a
momentary
stand
at
dusk
they
reached
villa
nova
the
transpontine
suburb
of
oporto
which
they
evacuated
during
the
night
the
moment
that
they
had
crossed
the
bridge
of
boats
soult
caused
it
to
be
blown
up
and
vainly
believed
himself
secure
now
that
the
broad
and
rapid
douro
was
rolling
between
him
and
his
enemy
the
total
loss
of
the
french
in
the
day
s
fighting
had
been
about
men
of
whom
were
prisoners
that
of
the
british
was
two
officers
and
nineteen
men
killed
six
officers
and
men
wounded
and
sixteen
men
missing
nearly
half
the
casualties
were
in
the
ranks
of
the
two
squadrons
of
dragoons
the
rest
were
divided
between
the
light
companies
of
the
battalion
of
detachments
the
and
battalions
of
the
german
legion
and
the
portuguese
the
officers
killed
were
captain
detmering
of
the
and
a
portuguese
ensign
of
the
those
wounded
were
captain
ovens
and
lieutenant
woodgate
of
the
battalion
of
detachments
lieutenants
lodders
and
lahngren
of
the
cornet
tomkinson
of
the
light
dragoons
and
a
portuguese
lieutenant
of
the
it
would
seem
that
some
of
the
fourteen
missing
were
infantry
killed
in
the
woods
whose
bodies
were
never
found
but
several
belonged
to
the
maltreated
dragoon
squadrons
and
were
taken
from
having
pursued
too
fast
and
far
on
the
night
of
the
when
mermet
and
franceschi
had
joined
him
soult
had
collected
in
oporto
the
main
body
of
his
army
he
had
in
hand
of
cavalry
franceschi
s
four
regiments
and
of
infantry
fifteen
battalions
of
mermet
s
division
seven
battalions
of
merle
s
forming
reynaud
s
brigade
and
seven
of
delaborde
s
a
force
in
all
of
about
bayonets
and
sabres
only
a
few
miles
away
at
baltar
on
the
road
to
amarante
were
caulaincourt
s
dragoons
and
the
remaining
regiment
of
delaborde
s
division
an
additional
force
of
somewhat
over
men
with
men
at
his
disposal
and
a
splendid
position
behind
the
douro
he
imagined
that
he
might
retreat
at
leisure
maintaining
the
line
of
the
impassable
river
for
some
days
more
he
intended
to
hold
oporto
long
enough
to
enable
loison
to
clear
the
road
to
villa
real
and
to
allow
lorges
and
the
belated
troops
from
the
north
time
to
march
in
to
amarante
he
was
somewhat
vexed
to
have
received
no
news
from
loison
for
four
days
but
when
last
heard
of
on
may
that
general
was
moving
forward
into
the
with
orders
to
push
on
and
open
a
way
for
the
army
as
far
as
the
spanish
border
silveira
having
retired
to
the
south
bank
of
the
douro
the
marshal
had
no
doubt
that
loison
would
easily
brush
away
the
and
open
for
the
whole
d
the
passage
to
zamora
and
the
plains
of
leon
meanwhile
the
only
danger
which
the
marshal
feared
was
that
wellesley
might
send
forward
the
fleet
of
which
had
carried
hill
to
ovar
bring
them
to
the
estuary
of
the
douro
and
use
them
to
pass
troops
across
its
lowest
reach
just
within
the
bar
at
its
mouth
accordingly
he
told
franceschi
to
patrol
carefully
the
five
miles
of
the
river
that
lie
between
oporto
and
the
sea
the
infantry
was
comfortably
housed
in
the
city
with
pickets
watching
the
quays
every
boat
on
the
river
as
it
was
supposed
had
either
been
destroyed
or
brought
over
to
the
north
bank
wellesley
would
as
soult
calculated
be
compelled
to
spend
several
days
in
making
his
preparations
for
passing
the
douro
since
he
had
no
means
of
pushing
his
army
across
the
broad
stream
save
the
which
he
might
bring
round
from
the
lagoon
of
ovar
the
marshal
therefore
was
quite
at
his
ease
even
though
he
knew
that
wellesley
s
vanguard
was
at
villa
nova
in
force
he
imagined
that
he
could
count
on
ample
time
for
the
evacuation
of
oporto
and
began
to
make
arrangements
for
a
leisurely
retreat
his
first
care
was
to
send
off
eastward
all
his
convalescents
his
reserve
ammunition
and
his
wheeled
vehicles
of
which
he
had
collected
a
fair
supply
during
his
seven
weeks
halt
at
oporto
these
were
to
march
under
the
convoy
of
mermet
s
division
during
the
course
of
the
morning
the
other
troops
from
merle
s
and
delaborde
s
divisions
together
with
franceschi
s
horse
were
to
watch
the
lower
douro
and
check
any
attempt
of
the
british
to
cross
the
marshal
was
himself
lodged
at
a
villa
on
the
high
ground
west
of
the
city
from
which
he
commanded
a
fine
view
of
the
whole
valley
from
oporto
to
the
sea
the
view
was
blocked
by
the
hill
crowned
by
the
serra
convent
where
the
river
makes
a
slight
bend
in
order
to
get
round
the
projecting
heights
on
the
southern
bank
so
thoroughly
were
both
soult
and
his
staff
impressed
with
the
idea
that
wellesley
would
endeavour
to
operate
below
and
not
above
the
city
that
while
the
lower
reaches
of
the
douro
were
watched
with
the
greatest
care
a
very
inefficient
was
kept
on
the
banks
above
oporto
there
would
seem
to
have
been
but
a
single
battalion
placed
in
that
direction
and
this
small
force
was
lying
far
back
from
the
river
with
no
proper
system
of
pickets
thrown
forward
to
the
water
s
edge
yet
the
opposite
bank
was
full
of
cover
of
thickets
gardens
and
olive
groves
screening
several
lanes
and
that
had
led
down
to
ferries
such
of
the
boats
as
had
not
been
scuttled
had
been
brought
over
to
the
north
bank
but
they
were
not
all
protected
by
proper
guards
all
this
was
inexcusably
careless
the
main
blame
must
fall
on
the
marshal
for
his
in
refusing
to
look
though
some
must
also
be
reserved
for
general
quesnel
the
governor
of
oporto
and
for
foy
the
brigadier
whose
battalions
were
in
charge
of
the
eastern
suburb
of
the
city
but
the
fact
was
that
none
of
the
french
officers
dreamed
of
the
possibility
that
wellesley
might
make
an
attempt
on
the
very
morning
of
his
arrival
to
cross
the
tremendous
obstacle
interposed
in
his
way
by
the
rolling
stream
of
the
douro
that
he
would
deliver
a
frontal
attack
on
them
in
full
daylight
was
beyond
the
limits
of
the
probable
they
had
no
conception
of
the
enterprise
of
the
man
with
whom
they
had
to
deal
there
was
this
amount
of
truth
in
their
view
that
the
british
general
would
not
have
made
his
daring
stroke
at
oporto
unless
he
had
ascertained
that
the
carelessness
of
his
adversaries
had
placed
an
unexpected
chance
in
his
hands
by
ten
o
clock
in
the
morning
wellesley
had
concentrated
behind
villa
nova
the
whole
of
his
force
the
three
columns
of
paget
hill
and
sherbrooke
were
now
up
in
line
they
were
kept
out
of
sight
of
the
enemy
some
in
the
lateral
lanes
of
the
suburb
but
the
majority
hidden
behind
the
back
slope
of
the
hills
where
orchards
and
vineyards
gave
them
complete
cover
from
observers
on
the
northern
bank
while
the
troops
were
coming
up
sir
arthur
mounted
the
serra
height
and
reconnoitred
the
whole
from
the
garden
of
the
convent
he
had
with
him
portuguese
notables
who
were
well
acquainted
with
oporto
and
its
suburbs
including
several
persons
who
had
come
over
the
river
on
the
preceding
day
and
could
give
him
some
notion
of
the
general
disposition
and
emplacement
of
the
french
army
sweeping
the
valley
with
his
glasses
he
could
see
franceschi
s
vedettes
moving
about
on
the
heights
and
heavy
columns
of
infantry
forming
up
outside
the
gates
of
the
city
at
eleven
o
clock
this
body
moved
off
escorting
a
long
train
of
wagons
it
was
mermet
s
division
starting
for
amarante
in
charge
of
soult
s
convoy
of
sick
and
reserve
artillery
on
the
quays
below
the
broken
bridge
many
french
pickets
were
visible
ensconced
at
the
openings
of
the
streets
which
lead
down
to
the
water
but
turning
his
glass
to
the
right
wellesley
could
note
that
matters
looked
very
quiet
the
rocky
banks
above
the
river
were
deserted
and
nothing
was
visible
among
the
gardens
and
scattered
houses
of
the
suburb
it
was
possible
that
french
troops
might
be
ensconced
there
but
no
sign
of
them
was
to
be
seen
many
had
already
been
sent
off
to
scour
the
southern
bank
of
the
river
and
to
ascertain
whether
by
any
chance
the
enemy
had
overlooked
some
of
the
boats
belonging
to
the
riverside
villages
in
a
short
time
two
valuable
pieces
of
news
were
brought
up
to
the
the
large
at
barca
d
avintas
four
miles
above
the
city
had
been
scuttled
but
not
injured
beyond
the
possibility
of
hasty
repairs
it
was
already
being
baled
out
and
mended
by
the
villagers
nearer
at
hand
a
still
more
important
discovery
was
made
colonel
waters
one
of
the
best
scouts
in
the
army
had
met
not
far
south
of
the
suburban
village
of
cobranloes
an
oporto
refugee
a
barber
by
trade
who
had
crossed
over
from
the
north
bank
in
a
small
skiff
which
he
had
hidden
in
a
thicket
the
man
reported
that
the
opposite
bank
was
for
the
moment
unguarded
by
the
french
and
pointed
to
four
large
lying
stranded
below
the
brink
of
the
northern
shore
with
no
signs
of
an
enemy
in
charge
yet
the
position
was
one
which
should
have
been
well
watched
here
a
massive
building
the
bishop
s
seminary
surrounded
by
a
high
garden
wall
lies
with
its
back
to
the
water
it
was
an
isolated
structure
standing
well
outside
the
eastern
suburb
in
fairly
open
ground
which
could
be
easily
swept
by
artillery
fire
from
the
dominating
position
of
the
serra
heights
waters
had
with
him
as
guide
the
prior
of
amarante
and
by
his
aid
collected
three
or
four
peasants
from
the
neighbouring
cottages
after
some
persuasion
from
the
ecclesiastic
these
men
and
the
barber
consented
to
join
the
british
officer
in
a
raid
on
the
stranded
barges
on
the
further
bank
it
was
a
hazardous
undertaking
for
one
french
picket
had
lately
been
seen
to
pass
by
and
another
might
appear
at
any
moment
but
the
necessary
was
obtained
waters
and
his
fellows
entered
the
barber
s
skiff
crossed
the
river
unseen
got
the
four
barges
afloat
and
returned
with
them
to
the
southern
bank
they
turned
out
to
be
big
clumsy
vessels
capable
of
holding
some
thirty
men
apiece
the
explorer
had
noted
that
the
seminary
buildings
above
were
perfectly
empty
on
receiving
this
intelligence
wellesley
resolved
to
take
the
chance
which
the
fates
offered
him
if
the
french
had
shown
themselves
alert
and
vigilant
he
could
not
have
dared
to
throw
troops
across
the
river
into
their
midst
but
they
seemed
asleep
at
high
noon
and
their
manifest
negligence
encouraged
him
his
mind
was
soon
made
up
he
ordered
murray
with
two
battalions
of
his
brigade
two
guns
and
two
squadrons
of
the
light
dragoons
to
march
hard
for
barca
d
avintas
cross
on
the
ferry
and
seize
a
position
on
the
opposite
bank
capable
of
being
defended
against
superior
numbers
but
this
as
the
small
force
employed
sufficiently
demonstrates
was
only
intended
as
a
diversion
the
main
blow
was
to
be
delivered
nearer
at
hand
wellesley
had
resolved
to
endeavour
to
seize
the
abandoned
seminary
and
to
throw
his
main
body
across
the
river
at
this
point
if
possible
the
local
conditions
made
the
scheme
less
rash
in
fact
than
it
appears
on
the
map
the
east
end
of
the
serra
hill
completely
commands
all
the
ground
about
the
seminary
three
batteries
were
quietly
pushed
into
the
convent
garden
and
trained
upon
the
roads
leading
to
that
isolated
building
one
along
the
shore
the
other
further
inland
if
the
place
could
once
be
seized
it
would
be
possible
to
protect
its
garrison
by
fire
across
the
water
there
were
only
two
artillery
positions
on
the
french
bank
from
which
the
seminary
could
be
battered
one
close
to
the
water
s
edge
was
completely
under
the
guns
of
the
serra
convent
the
other
on
the
heights
by
the
chapel
of
bom
fin
was
rather
distant
and
could
not
be
used
against
boats
crossing
the
river
as
they
would
be
invisible
to
gunners
working
on
this
emplacement
cannon
placed
there
might
do
some
damage
to
the
seminary
buildings
but
could
not
prevent
the
garrison
from
being
reinforced
realizing
all
this
at
a
glance
wellesley
hurried
down
hill
s
brigade
to
the
water
s
edge
and
the
moment
that
the
leading
company
of
the
buffs
had
got
on
board
the
barges
bade
them
push
off
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
first
vessel
was
over
and
a
subaltern
and
men
rushed
up
into
the
empty
enclosure
of
the
seminary
and
closed
the
big
iron
gate
opening
into
the
vallongo
road
which
formed
its
only
the
men
from
the
other
barges
were
just
behind
they
set
themselves
to
lining
the
garden
wall
and
to
piling
up
wood
and
earth
against
it
in
order
to
give
themselves
a
from
which
they
could
fire
over
the
coping
the
barges
went
back
with
all
speed
and
were
again
loaded
and
sent
off
meanwhile
wellesley
and
his
staff
were
looking
down
in
breathless
anxiety
on
the
quiet
bend
of
the
river
the
silent
suburb
and
the
toiling
vessels
at
any
moment
the
alarm
might
be
given
and
masses
of
the
enemy
might
debouch
from
the
city
and
dash
in
upon
the
seminary
before
enough
men
were
across
to
hold
it
for
the
best
part
of
an
hour
the
must
have
been
fully
aware
that
his
daring
move
might
end
only
in
the
annihilation
of
two
or
three
companies
of
a
good
old
regiment
and
a
check
that
would
appear
as
the
righteous
retribution
for
recklessness
and
line
battalions
of
the
also
a
detached
company
of
rifles
of
the
lane
s
and
lawson
s
british
guns
and
one
battery
but
no
stir
was
seen
in
oporto
the
barges
crossed
for
a
second
time
unmolested
on
their
third
trip
they
carried
over
general
edward
paget
whom
wellesley
had
placed
in
command
of
the
whole
movement
more
than
half
the
buffs
had
passed
and
the
seminary
was
beginning
to
be
adequately
manned
when
at
last
some
shots
were
heard
outside
the
gates
and
a
few
minutes
later
a
line
of
french
supported
by
three
battalions
in
column
came
rushing
down
upon
the
enclosures
a
full
hour
had
passed
between
the
moment
when
the
first
boatload
of
british
soldiers
had
been
thrown
across
the
river
and
the
time
when
the
french
discovered
them

wellesley
s
passage
of
the
douro
the
trees
on
the
cliff
to
the
right
are
close
outside
the
enclosure
of
the
serra
convent
the
roof
of
the
seminary
is
just
visible
over
the
crest
of
the
hill
on
the
other
bank
in
the
background
are
the
low
slopes
above
avintas
the
fact
was
that
the
enemy
s
commander
was
in
bed
and
his
staff
breakfasting
the
duke
of
dalmatia
had
sat
up
all
night
dictating
dispatches
and
making
his
arrangements
for
a
leisurely
flitting
for
he
intended
to
stay
two
days
longer
in
oporto
so
as
to
cover
the
march
of
his
other
divisions
towards
amarante
and
villa
real
his
finished
he
went
to
bed
at
about
nine
o
clock
in
full
confidence
that
he
was
well
protected
by
the
river
and
that
wellesley
was
probably
engaged
in
the
laborious
task
of
bringing
up
boats
to
the
mouth
of
the
douro
which
would
occupy
him
for
at
least
hours
the
staff
were
taking
their
coffee
after
a
late
when
the
of
a
furious
rider
startled
them
and
a
moment
later
brossard
the
of
general
foy
burst
into
the
villa
shouting
that
the
english
had
got
into
the
town
led
to
the
marshal
s
bedside
he
hurriedly
explained
that
foy
had
just
discovered
the
enemy
passing
by
boats
into
the
seminary
and
was
massing
his
brigade
for
an
attack
upon
them
the
marshal
started
up
sent
his
staff
flying
in
all
directions
to
warn
the
outlying
troops
ordered
all
the
remaining
to
be
sent
off
on
the
vallongo
road
and
dispatched
brossard
back
to
foy
to
tell
him
to
push
the
english
into
the
he
was
hardly
dressed
and
on
horseback
when
the
noise
of
a
distant
fusillade
followed
by
heavy
artillery
fire
gave
the
news
that
the
attack
on
the
seminary
had
already
begun
soult
s
doings
on
this
day
are
best
told
by
his
chamans
who
was
with
him
all
the
morning
no
attention
need
be
paid
to
the
narrative
of
his
panegyrist
le
noble
who
tells
a
foolish
story
to
the
effect
that
a
commandant
salel
came
at
six
o
clock
more
than
four
hours
before
the
buffs
began
to
pass
and
assured
some
of
soult
s
staff
that
the
english
were
already
crossing
the
river
on
hearing
this
says
le
noble
the
marshal
sent
for
quesnel
the
governor
of
oporto
and
asked
if
there
was
any
truth
in
the
rumour
the
latter
denied
it
and
soult
was
reassured
if
only
salel
had
been
believed
all
the
english
who
had
then
passed
might
have
been
killed
or
captured
and
a
disaster
avoided
as
a
matter
of
fact
quesnel
was
right
and
not
a
british
soldier
had
yet
crossed
de
it
had
been
only
at
ten
that
foy
riding
along
the
heights
by
the
chapel
of
bom
fin
had
been
informed
that
there
were
boats
on
the
river
filled
with
soldiery
it
took
him
wellnigh
of
an
hour
to
bring
up
his
nearest
regiment
the
léger
and
only
at
did
the
attack
on
the
seminary
begin
the
three
battalions
beset
the
northern
and
western
sides
of
the
seminary
and
made
a
vigorous
attempt
to
break
in
while
some
guns
were
hurried
down
to
the
river
bank
just
below
the
building
to
fire
upon
the
barges
that
were
bringing
up
reinforcements
wellesley
from
his
eyrie
on
the
serra
heights
had
been
watching
for
the
outburst
of
the
french
the
moment
that
they
came
pressing
forward
he
gave
orders
for
the
eighteen
guns
in
the
convent
garden
to
open
upon
them
the
first
shot
fired
a
round
of
shrapnel
from
the
howitzer
of
lane
s
battery
burst
just
over
the
leading
french
gun
on
the
further
bank
as
it
was
in
the
act
of
unlimbering
dismounted
the
piece
and
by
an
extraordinary
chance
killed
or
wounded
every
man
and
horse
attached
to
it
a
moment
later
came
the
blast
of
the
other
seventeen
guns
which
swept
the
level
ground
to
the
west
of
the
seminary
with
awful
effect
the
french
attack
reeled
back
and
the
survivors
fled
from
the
open
ground
into
the
houses
of
the
suburb
leaving
the
disabled
cannon
behind
them
again
and
again
they
tried
to
creep
forward
to
flank
the
english
stronghold
and
to
fire
at
the
barges
as
they
went
and
came
but
on
every
occasion
they
were
swept
away
by
the
hail
of
shrapnel
they
could
therefore
only
attack
the
seminary
on
its
northern
front
where
the
buildings
lay
between
them
and
the
serra
height
and
so
screened
them
from
the
artillery
but
in
half
an
hour
the
léger
was
beaten
off
and
terribly
mauled
they
had
to
cross
an
open
space
the
prado
do
bispo
in
order
to
get
near
their
adversaries
and
the
fire
from
the
garden
wall
the
windows
and
the
flat
roof
of
the
edifice
swept
them
away
before
they
could
close
this
interesting
fact
i
owe
to
the
diary
of
captain
lane
still
in
manuscript
of
which
a
copy
has
been
sent
me
by
whinyates
a
specialist
on
the
history
of
the
british
artillery
in
the
peninsula
meanwhile
the
english
suffered
little
the
only
serious
loss
sustained
was
that
of
general
edward
paget
whose
arm
was
shattered
by
a
bullet
he
was
replaced
in
command
by
hill
who
like
him
had
crossed
in
one
of
the
earlier
barges
the
number
of
troops
in
the
building
was
always
growing
larger
the
buffs
were
all
across
and
the
and
were
beginning
to
follow
after
a
short
slackening
in
the
engagement
general
delaborde
came
up
with
the
three
battalions
of
the
of
the
line
to
support
his
brigadier
this
new
force
executed
a
far
more
sustained
and
desperate
attack
on
the
seminary
than
had
their
predecessors
hill
in
his
letters
home
called
it
the
but
it
had
no
better
fortune
than
the
last
a
thousand
english
infantry
comfortably
ensconced
behind
stone
walls
and
protected
on
their
flanks
by
the
storm
of
shot
and
shell
from
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
could
not
easily
be
moved
so
well
indeed
were
they
covered
that
in
three
hours
fighting
they
only
lost
men
while
the
open
ground
outside
was
thickly
strewn
with
the
dead
and
wounded
frenchmen
viz
fifty
men
seventeen
men
ten
men
killed
and
wounded
the
french
alone
lost
foy
s
dispatch
soult
was
now
growing
desperate
he
ordered
up
from
the
city
reynaud
s
brigade
which
had
hitherto
guarded
the
quays
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
broken
bridge
his
intention
was
to
make
one
more
attack
on
the
seminary
and
if
that
failed
to
draw
off
in
the
direction
of
vallongo
and
amarante
this
move
made
an
end
of
his
chances
he
had
forgotten
to
reckon
with
the
portuguese
the
moment
that
the
quays
were
left
unguarded
hundreds
of
citizens
poured
out
of
their
houses
and
ran
down
to
the
water
s
edge
where
they
launched
all
the
boats
that
had
been
drawn
ashore
and
took
them
over
to
the
english
bank
richard
stewart
s
brigade
and
the
guards
who
had
been
waiting
under
cover
of
the
houses
of

began
to
embark
and
in
a
few
moments
the
passage
had
begun

first
formed
up
on
the
northern
bank
and
dashed
up
the
main
street
into
the
city
meeting
little
or
no
opposition
the
battalion
of

followed
in
half
an
hour
they
had
come
upon
the
flank
of
the
french
force
which
was
attacking
the
seminary
and
had
taken
in
the
rear
and
captured
one
of
soult
s
reserve
batteries
whose
horses
were
shot
down
before
they
could
escape
along
a
narrow
lane
as
the
british
went
pouring
through
oporto
the
whole
population
half
mad
with
joy
stood
cheering
at
the
windows
and
on
the
roofs
waving
their
handkerchiefs
and
shouting
the
rabble
poured
down
into
the
streets
and
began
to
attack
the
french
wounded
so
that
sherbrooke
had
to
detach
a
company
to
protect
them
from
assassination
all
this
is
well
described
by

of
the
scots

guards
and
cooper
of
the
who
crossed
later
when
soult
found
himself
thus
attacked
in
the
flank
he
saw
that
there
was
no
more
to
be
done
and
bade
the
whole
army
retreat
at
full
speed
along
the
road
to
vallongo
and
baltar
they
went
off
in
a
confused
mass

mingled
together

made
no

writes
an
every
man
seemed
running
for
his
life
throwing
away
their
knapsacks
and

so
that
we
had
only
the
trouble
of
making
many
prisoners

the
french
army
might
have
been
still
further
mauled
and
indeed
almost
destroyed
if
wellesley
s
detached
force
under
murray
had
been
well
handled
by
its
commander
the
two
battalions
of
the
german
legion
with
their
attendant
squadrons
of
the
light
dragoons
had
crossed
the
douro
at
the
ferry
of
barca
d
avintas
wholly
unopposed
it
was
a
slow
business
but
the
detachment
was
over
long
ere
soult
had
abandoned
his
attack
on
the
seminary
advancing
cautiously
along
the
river
bank
murray
suddenly
saw
the
whole
french
army
come
pouring
past
him
in
total
disorder
on
the
line
of
the
vallongo
road
he
might
have
made
an
attempt
to
throw
himself
across
their
path
or
at
least
have
fallen
upon
their
flank
and
endeavoured
to
cut
the
column
in
two
but
thinking
them
far
too
strong
for
his
small
force
and
forgetting
their
demoralization
he
halted
and
allowed
them
to
go
by
when
all
had
passed
general
charles
stewart
who
had
been
sent
in
search
of
murray
by
the
came
galloping
up
to
the
force
and
took
from
it
a
squadron
of
the
with
which
he
made
a
dash
at
the
enemy
s
last
troops
the
french
had
now
formed
a
sort
of
rearguard
but
the
dragoons
rode
into
it
without
hesitation
the
french
generals
were
bringing
up
the
rear
and
trying
to
keep
their
men
steady
delaborde
was
unhorsed
and
for
a
moment
was
a
prisoner
but
escaped
owing
to
his
captor
being
killed
foy
received
a
sabre
cut
on
the
shoulder
the
infantry
broke
and
nearly
of
them
were
cut
off
and
captured
but
the
dragoons
also
suffered
heavily
of
about
men
who
took
part
in
the
charge
no
less
than
men
were
killed
and
wounded
murray
who
watched
the
whole
skirmish
from
his
position
on
a
neighbouring
hillside
gave
no
assistance
to
his
cavalry
though
the
intervention
of
his
two
battalions
would
have
led
to
the
capture
of
the
whole
of
soult
s
rearguard
it
was
to
infantry
of
sherbrooke
s
division
that
the
dragoons
turned
over
their
prisoners
before
rejoining
their
other
squadron
so
hawker
of
that
regiment
who
took
part
in
the
charge
and
describes
it
well
in
wellesley
s
dispatch
squadrons
are
wrongly
named
the
best
account
of
this
charge
is
the
diary
of
hawker
it
runs
as
follows
after
going
at
full
speed
enveloped
in
a
cloud
of
dust
for
nearly
two
miles
we
cleared
our
infantry
and
that
of
the
french
appeared
a
strong
body
was
drawn
up
in
close
column
with
bayonets
ready
to
receive
us
on
their
front
on
each
side
of
the
road
was
a
stone
wall
bordered
outwardly
with
trees
on
our
left
in
particular
numbers
of
the
french
were
posted
with
their
pieces
resting
on
the
wall
which
flanked
the
road
ready
to
give
us
a
running
fire
as
we
passed
this
could
not
but
be
effectual
as
our
men
in
threes
were
close
to
the
muzzles
of
their
muskets
and
barely
out
of
the
reach
of
a
de
in
a
few
seconds
the
ground
was
covered
with
our
men
and
horses
notwithstanding
this
we
penetrated
the
battalion
in
the
road
the
men
of
which
relying
on
their
bayonets
did
not
give
way
till
we
were
close
upon
them
when
they
fled
in
confusion
for
some
time
the
contest
was
kept
up
hand
to
hand
after
many
efforts
we
succeeded
in
cutting
off
of
whom
most
were
secured
as
prisoners
but
our
loss
was
very
considerable
of
men
in
the
leading
troop
ten
were
killed
and
eleven
severely
wounded
besides
others
slightly
and
six
taken
of
the
last
all
save
one
succeeded
in
slipping
off
and
got
back
out
of
four
officers
engaged
three
were
wounded
hervey
the
major
in
command
lost
an
arm
foy
called
the
attack
une
charge
so
ended
the
battle
of
oporto
daring
in
its
conception
splendidly
successful
in
its
execution
yet
not
so
decisive
as
it
might
have
been
had
murray
but
done
his
duty
during
the
pursuit
the
british
loss
was
astoundingly
small
only
killed
wounded
and
two
missing
among
the
dead
there
was
not
a
single
officer
the
wounded
included
a
general
paget
and
three
majors
the
casualties
of
the
french
were
as
was
natural
much
greater
the
attacks
on
the
seminary
had
cost
them
dear
they
lost
about
killed
and
wounded
and
nearly
as
many
prisoners
in
the
field
while
more
than
sick
and
wounded
were
captured
in
the
hospitals
of
oporto
the
trophies
consisted
of
the
six
taken
during
the
fighting
a
great
number
of
baggage
wagons
and
portuguese
guns
dismounted
but
fit
for
further
service
which
were
found
in
the
arsenal
soult
had
destroyed
before
retreating
the
rest
of
the
cannon
which
he
had
captured
in
the
portuguese
lines
on
march
fantin
des
odoards
says
that
the
french
left
men
in
the
hospitals
this
is
probably
a
little
too
high
an
estimate
there
were
only
french
sick
in
braga
viana
and
oporto
on
may
of
them
at
oporto
but
many
convalescents
had
marched
with
mermet
early
on
the
eleventh
wellington
in
his
first
dispatch
merely
says
that
he
had
taken
sick
in
the
hospitals
but
three
days
later
in
a
letter
to
admiral
berkeley
he
writes
that
he
has
sick
wounded
and
captured
french
in
his
hands
and
must
send
them
to
england
at
once
iv
he
therefore
asks
for
shipping
for
them
at
the
rate
of
two
tons
per
man
allowing
for
unwounded
prisoners
at
oporto
and
at

iii
soult
s
retreat
from
oporto
the
headlong
charge
of
hervey
s
squadron
of
the
light
dragoons
was
the
last
molestation
which
fell
to
the
lot
of
soult
s
retreating
column
on
the
afternoon
of
may
marching
till
dark
the
disordered
infantry
encamped
at
baltar
ten
miles
from
oporto
where
they
fell
in
with
the
detached
regiment
of
delaborde
s
division
and
with
caulaincourt
s
dragoons
who
had
been
guarding
this
stage
between
amarante
and
oporto
ever
since
loison
had
marched
on
into
the
ten
days
before
of
the
rest
of
the
french
army
franceschi
always
in
the
post
of
danger
covered
the
rear
at
vallongo
just
west
of
baltar
mermet
with
the
division
that
had
marched
from
oporto
before
wellesley
s
attack
was
developed
had
encamped
on
the
souza
river
four
miles
ahead
of
the
main
column
the
marshal
had
thus
nearly
men
concentrated
and
proposed
next
day
to
push
on
for
amarante
in
the
wake
of
loison
who
as
he
supposed
must
now
be
well
ahead
in
the
clearing
for
him
the
way
into
spain
it
was
disquieting
however
to
find
that
no
news
from
that
general
had
yet
come
to
hand
indeed
he
had
not
been
heard
of
since
may
when
he
was
just
starting
out
on
his
expedition
wherever
loison
might
be
the
marshal
was
bound
to
follow
him
in
haste
since
it
was
certain
that
wellesley
would
be
close
at
his
heels
and
that
no
time
was
to
be
lost
in
lingering
at
one
in
the
morning
soult
was
roused
from
sleep
and
informed
that
the
messenger
from
loison
had
at
last
arrived
the
news
which
he
brought
was
nothing
less
than
appalling
the
french
detached
corps
had
been
not
only
checked
but
beaten
the
bridge
of
amarante
had
been
lost
and
loison
was
hastily
retreating
to
the
at
the
moment
that
his
chief
was
moving
eastward
to
join
him
see
le
noble
de
pp
beresford
s
turning
movement
in
fact
had
been
completely
successful
far
more
so
than
wellesley
had
thought
likely
he
had
not
only
succeeded
in
placing
himself
across
the
french
line
of
retreat
into
spain
but
had
beaten
loison
and
thrown
him
back
into
soult
s
arms
what
had
happened
was
shortly
this
on
may
beresford
had
picked
up
wilson
s
detachment
at
vizeu
on
the
tenth
he
had
met
silveira
at
lamego
he
had
thus
concentrated
some
or
men
all
portuguese
save
tilson
s
brigade
and
the
single
squadron
of
the
light
dragoons
learning
at
lamego
that
as
late
as
the
ninth
loison
was
still
in
the
neighbourhood
of
amarante
and
had
not
yet
penetrated
far
into
the
beresford
resolved
to
take
the
risk
of
passing
the
douro
and
to
throw
his
army
directly
across
the
path
of
the
advancing
french
on
the
tenth
the
same
day
on
which
the
force
from
coimbra
reached
lamego
he
sent
silveira
over
the
river
by
the
bridge
of
peso
da
regoa
which
had
never
passed
out
of
the
hands
of
the
portuguese
and
had
a
strong
on
its
northern
side
silveira
had
barely
crossed
when
loison
who
had
spent
the
previous
day
at
mezamfrio
ten
miles
away
on
the
amarante
road
came
up
against
him
with
heudelet
s
and
sarrut
s
infantry
and
marisy
s
dragoons
about
sabres
and
bayonets
emboldened
by
having
entrenchments
to
help
him
and
by
knowing
that
beresford
was
close
behind
silveira
stood
firm
at
the
and
accepted
battle
loison
was
somewhat
discouraged
by
his
adversary
s
confidence
and
did
not
fail
to
note
the
masses
of
troops
on
the
southern
bank
of
the
douro
which
were
moving
up
to
the
bridge
to
support
silveira
however
late
in
the
afternoon
he
attacked
the
portuguese
but
was
steadily
met
and
beaten
off
with
some
loss
thereupon
he
drew
back
and
retired
to
mezamfrio
on
the
following
day
may
he
continued
his
retreat
to
amarante
closely
pursued
by
silveira
who
kept
driving
in
his
rearguard
wherever
it
attempted
to
make
a
stand
loison
reported
to
soult
that
he
lost
only
a
de
and
eighty
men
but
that
the
horses
of
himself
and
generals
heudelet
and
maransin
were
killed
under
them
the
figures
given
are
probably
an
understatement
beresford
meanwhile
brought
his
own
troops
across
the
douro
on
may
in
the
wake
of
silveira
s
division
on
the
twelfth
he
pushed
forward
to
amarante
intending
to
fight
loison
if
the
latter
should
try
to
hold
his
ground
beyond
the
bridge
but
on
his
approach
he
found
that
the
french
rearguard
sarrut
s
brigade
had
already
been
driven
across
the
water
by
the
portuguese
the
bridge
however
still
remained
in
loison
s
hands
and
as
it
was
no
less
defensible
from
the
eastern
than
from
the
western
bank
the
army
could
get
no
further
forward
the
british
brigade
of
tilson
was
to
have
led
the
attack
they
were
burning
for
a
fight
i
never
witnessed
so
much
enthusiasm
writes
an
as
was
shown
by
the
men
the
advance
was
a
perfect
trot
but
on
our
arrival
we
found
the
enemy
had
from
an
unpublished
letter
of
lord
gough
then
colonel
of
the
regiment
which
has
been
placed
at
my
disposal
by
the
kindness
of
rait
of
new
college
who
is
preparing
a
life
of
that
officer
matters
were
now
at
a
deadlock
for
if
beresford
could
not
cross
the
tamega
it
was
clear
that
loison
even
if
heavily
reinforced
from
oporto
would
not
be
able
to
force
the
imposing
position
on
the
heights
commanding
the
bridge
which
was
now
held
by
men
including
a
british
brigade
but
he
might
and
should
have
continued
to
hold
the
town
and
the
till
further
orders
reached
him
from
soult
instead
of
doing
so
he
made
up
his
mind
to
retreat
at
once
and
marched
off
early
on
the
evening
of
may
along
the
road
to
guimaraens
and
braga
thus
at
the
moment
when
soult
was
retiring
on
amarante
loison
abandoned
the
position
which
covered
his
chief
s
chosen
line
of
retreat
moreover
he
was
so
tardy
in
sending
news
of
his
intentions
to
head
quarters
that
the
who
bore
his
dispatch
only
reached
baltar
after
midnight
on
the
this
was
the
first
report
that
soult
had
received
from
him
since
may
it
was
a
military
crime
of
the
highest
magnitude
that
he
had
neither
informed
his
chief
of
the
check
at
peso
da
regoa
on
the
tenth
nor
of
his
retreat
to
amarante
on
the
eleventh
knowledge
of
these
facts
would
have
been
invaluable
to
the
marshal
since
it
would
have
shown
him
that
the
route
through
the
was
blocked
and
that
he
must
not
count
upon
an
undisturbed
retreat
into
spain
if
he
had
known
of
this
he
would
not
have
evacuated
oporto
by
the
baltar
road
but
would
have
been
forced
to
march
northward
on
braga
or
guimaraens
instead
of
due
east
so
strange
in
fact
was
loison
s
slackness
that
soult
s
advocates
have
not
hesitated
to
accuse
him
of
deliberate
treachery
and
have
hinted
that
he
was
engaged
in
argenton
s
plot
a
hypothesis
which
would
have
explained
his
conduct
clearly
enough
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
argenton
s
revelations
to
wellesley
show
that
this
was
not
the
case
and
that
the
conspirators
looked
upon
loison
and
delaborde
as
the
two
officers
who
were
most
likely
to
give
them
trouble
it
must
therefore
have
been
sheer
military
incapacity
and
disgust
at
the
whole
portuguese
expedition
which
lay
at
the
bottom
of
loison
s
misbehaviour
disbelieving
in
soult
s
plan
of
campaign
he
was
probably
bent
on
compelling
his
chief
to
retire
to
braga
and
was
of
course
quite
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
wellesley
s
capture
of
oporto
had
changed
the
whole
face
of
affairs
and
that
the
retreat
in
that
direction
was
no
longer
open
despondent
tired
out
by
the
work
of
the
preceding
day
and
suffering
physically
from
a
heavy
fall
from
his
horse
during
the
retreat
soult
was
roused
from
his
slumbers
to
read
loison
s
disastrous
dispatch
when
he
had
made
out
its
full
meaning
he
was
appalled
all
his
plans
were
shattered
and
he
was
clearly
in
imminent
danger
for
wellesley
from
oporto
and
beresford
from
amarante
might
converge
upon
him
in
the
morning
with
nearly
men
if
it
should
chance
that
they
had
made
out
his
position
no
help
could
come
from
loison
who
having
now
reached
guimaraens
was
separated
from
the
main
body
by
the
roadless
expanse
of
the
rugged
serra
de
santa
catalina
eastward
lay
one
hostile
force
westward
another
to
the
south
was
the
impassable
douro
to
the
north
the
inhospitable
mountains
it
was
useless
to
think
of
making
a
desperate
dash
at
beresford
s
army
in
open
ground
an
attack
on
the
portuguese
might
have
been
practicable
but
the
bridge
of
amarante
was
a
post
impossible
to
force
in
a
hurry
and
while
the
attack
on
it
was
in
progress
it
was
certain
that
wellesley
would
come
up
from
the
rear
the
situation
and
the
results
of
baylen
would
inevitably
be
reproduced
realizing
this
the
duke
of
dalmatia
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
only
course
open
to
him
was
to
abandon
everything
that
could
not
be
carried
on
his
men
s
backs
and
to
make
a
desperate
attempt
to
cross
the
serra
de
santa
catalina
before
the
news
of
his
straits
had
reached
the
enemy
he
imagined
that
there
must
be
some
sort
of
a
footpath
from
baltar
or
penafiel
to
guimaraens
in
a
thickly
peopled
country
like
northern
portugal
the
have
short
cuts
of
their
own
the
only
difficulty
for
the
stranger
is
to
discover
them
hasty
inquiries
in
the
bivouac
of
the
army
produced
a
navarese
who
said
that
he
knew
the
localities
and
could
point
out
a
bad
which
climbed
the
hillside
above
the
souza
torrent
and
came
down
into
the
valley
of
the
avé
not
far
south
of
guimaraens
it
was
the
kind
of
path
in
which
the
army
would
meet
every
sort
of
difficulty
and
where
the
head
of
the
column
might
be
stopped
by
a
couple
of
hundred
if
it
should
chance
that
the
portuguese
peasantry
were
on
the
alert
but
it
seemed
the
only
practicable
way
out
of
the
situation
and
the
marshal
resolved
to
try
it

s
at
daybreak
the
army
was
warned
of
its
danger
and
wasting
no
time
on
councils
of
war
or
elaborate
orders
soult
sent
round
word
that
the
troops
were
to
abandon
everything
that
could
not
be
carried
on
the
backs
of
men
or
horses
and
to
take
to
the
hills
an
immense
mass
of
baggage
and
plunder
had
to
be
left
on
the
banks
of
the
souza
including
the
whole
of
the
heavy
convoy
which
mermet
had
escorted
out
of
oporto
on
the
previous
day
the
marshal
even
decided
that
the
infantry
should
turn
out
of
their
knapsacks
everything
except
food
and
cartridges
an
order
which
those
who
had
in
their
possession
gold
plate
and
other
valuable
plunder
of
small
bulk
took
care
to
disobey
the
cannon
were
destroyed
by
being
placed
mouth
to
mouth
and
discharged
simultaneously
in
pairs
as
much
of
the
reserve
ammunition
for
infantry
as
could
be
packed
in
convenient
bundles
was
laden
on
the
backs
of
the
artillery
horses
the
rest
with
all
the
powder
wagons
was
collected
in
a
mass
ready
to
be
fired
when
the
army
should
have
absconded
one
curious
circumstance
which
displays
better
than
anything
else
the
hurry
of
the
retreat
is
worth
mentioning
the
military
chest
of
the
corps
was
well
filled
it
is
said
to
have
contained
nearly
in
portuguese
silver
the
marshal
ordered
the
to
serve
out
all
that
he
could
to
the
regimental
paymasters
only
two
of
these
officials
could
be
found
and
they
were
unable
to
carry
off
more
than
a
fraction
of
the
money
soult
then
ordered
the
to
be
broken
open
and
sent
word
that
the
men
as
they
passed
might
help
themselves
but
hardly
a
soldier
took
advantage
of
the
offer
they
looked
at
the
bulky
bags
of
shook
their
heads
and
hurried
on
those
who
were
tempted
at
first
were
seen
later
in
the
day
tossing
the
weighty
pieces
into
the
ravine
of
the
souza
perceiving
that
there
was
no
way
of
getting
rid
of
the
mass
of
silver
soult
at
last
ordered
the
containing
it
to
be
dragged
alongside
of
the
powder
wagons
when
the
train
was
exploded
after
the
rearguard
had
passed
the
money
was
scattered
to
the
winds
for
years
after
the
peasants
of
penafiel
were
picking
up
stray
coins
on
the
hillside
several
of
the
french
diarists
relate
this
curious
incident

reader
will
compare
this
incident
with
the
rolling
of
moore
s
treasure
down
the
cliffs
of
herrerias
during
the
corunna
retreat
soult
certainly
scattered
his
cash
more
widely
as
the
french
army
was
beginning
its
weary
climb
over
the
serra
de
santa
catalina
a
heavy
drenching
rain
commenced
to
fall
it
lasted
for
three
days
and
added
much
to
the
miseries
of
the
retreat
but
it
was
not
without
its
advantages
to
the
fugitive
host
for
it
kept
the
portuguese
peasantry
indoors
and
it
would
seem
that
no
one
in
the
mountain
villages
got
wind
of
the
movement
for
many
hours
it
was
not
till
the
french
had
crossed
the
ridge
and
descended
late
in
the
dusk
on
to
the
village
of
pombeiro
in
the
valley
of
the
avé
that
they
began
to
be
molested
by
the
after
a
few
shots
had
been
fired
the
peasants
were
driven
off
next
morning
may
soult
got
into
communication
with
loison
who
was
still
lying
at
guimaraens
with
all
his
troops
on
the
same
day
lorges
dragoons
and
the
garrison
of
viana
came
in
from
the
north
and
the
whole
army
still
over
strong
was
reconcentrated
the
first
danger
that
of
destruction
piecemeal
had
been
avoided
but
soult
s
desperate
move
had
only
warded
off
the
peril
for
the
moment
he
had
still
to
fear
that
wellesley
and
beresford
might
close
in
upon
him
before
he
could
get
clear
of
the
mountains
it
remains
to
be
seen
how
the
two
british
generals
had
employed
the
day
during
which
the
french
were
scaling
the
heights
of
the
serra
de
santa
catalina
wellesley
had
crossed
in
person
to
oporto
long
ere
the
fighting
was
over
and
had
established
his
head
quarters
in
soult
s
villa
on
the
heights
where
he
and
his
staff
thought
themselves
fortunate
in
finding
ready
for
their
consumption
the
excellent
dinner
which
had
been
prepared
for
the
marshal
as
long
as
daylight
lasted
the
british
infantry
continued
to
be
ferried
over
to
the
city
but
they
were
not
all
across
when
night
fell
the
artillery
the
train
and
all
the
regimental
baggage
were
still
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
river
and
as
the
great
bridge
was
destroyed
beyond
hope
of
repair
all
the
had
to
be
brought
over
in
boats
and
barges
it
was
mainly
this
fact
that
delayed
wellesley
from
making
an
early
move
on
the
thirteenth
he
could
not
advance
without
his
guns
and
his
reserve
ammunition
and
did
not
receive
them
till
the
day
was
far
spent
and
the
natural
hour
for
marching
was
past
there
were
other
circumstances
which
hindered
him
from
pressing
on
as
he
would
have
liked
to
do
the
infantry
were
tired
out
they
had
marched
more
than
eighty
miles
during
the
last
four
days
and
had
fought
hard
at
grijon
and
oporto
human
nature
could
do
no
more
without
a
halt
and
wellesley
was
forced
to
grant
it
moreover
there
was
the
question
of
food
to
be
taken
into
consideration
the
troops
had
outrun
their
supplies
and
the
provision
wagons
were
still
trailing
up
from
coimbra
in
oporto
no
stores
of
any
importance
were
discovered
for
soult
had
stopped
collecting
more
than
he
could
carry
the
moment
that
he
made
up
his
mind
to
retreat
and
had
been
living
from
hand
to
mouth
during
the
last
few
days
of
his
sojourn
in
the
city
the
only
thing
that
abounded
was
port
wine
and
from
that
the
soldiers
had
to
be
kept
away
or
results
disastrous
to
discipline
would
have
followed
when
the
troops
got
at
the
wine
they
drank
only
too
well
hartmann
in
his
records
that
twenty
of
his
german
legion
gunners
drank
bottles
of
port
at
a
sitting
with
great
reluctance
therefore
wellesley
resolved
to
halt
for
a
day
only
sending
forward
murray
and
the
german
legion
with
a
couple
of
squadrons
along
the
baltar
road
this
brigade
did
not
come
up
with
soult
s
rearguard
though
they
found
ample
traces
of
his
passage
in
the
shape
of
murdered
stragglers
and
abandoned
plunder
no
doubt
the
would
have
directed
them
to
push
on
further
and
have
supported
them
with
every
battalion
that
could
still
march
ten
miles
if
only
he
had
been
aware
of
the
fact
that
beresford
had
got
possession
of
the
bridge
of
amarante
and
that
the
enemy
was
therefore
in
a
trap
but
he
was
only
in
communication
with
his
lieutenant
by
the
circuitous
route
of
lamego
and
mezamfrio
and
the
last
news
that
he
had
received
of
the
turning
column
led
him
to
believe
that
it
was
still
in
the
neighbourhood
of
villa
real
and
that
loison
continued
to
hold
the
passage
of
the
tamega
writing
to
beresford
on
the
night
of
the
capture
of
oporto
he
desired
him
to
make
every
effort
to
hold
on
to
villa
real
and
to
keep
soult
in
check
till
he
himself
could
overtake
him
iv
to
marshal
beresford
from
oporto
night
of
the
twelfth
it
was
not
till
the
afternoon
of
the
thirteenth
that
wellesley
obtained
information
that
put
him
on
the
right
track
the
intelligence
officer
with
murray
s
column
sent
him
back
word
that
heavy
explosions
had
been
heard
at
penafiel
and
that
the
smoke
of
large
fires
was
visible
along
the
hillside
above
it
this
gave
a
strong
hint
of
what
was
probably
taking
place
in
that
direction
but
it
was
not
till
five
in
the
afternoon
that
full
information
came
to
hand
this
was
brought
by
the
portuguese
secretary
of
general
quesnel
who
had
deserted
his
employer
and
ridden
back
to
oporto
to
give
the
valuable
news
which
would
save
him
from
being
tried
for
treason
for
serving
the
enemy
he
gave
an
accurate
and
detailed
account
of
all
that
had
happened
to
soult
s
column
and
had
seen
it
start
off
on
the
path
to
guimaraens
only
about
loison
was
he
uncertain
that
officer
he
said
was
probably
still
at
amarante
holding
back
silveira
and
beresford
a
captain

deposition
of
the
secretary
to
the
late
governor
of
oporto
supplementary
vi
may
afternoon
on
receipt
of
this
important
intelligence
wellesley
sent
orders
to
murray
to
press
on
his
small
force
of
cavalry
and
some
mounted
rifles
if
he
could
secure
horses
or
mules
as
far
as
penafiel
to
verify
the
secretary
s
information
a
later
dispatch
bade
him
press
on
to
amarante
if
loison
was
still
there
in
order
to
take
that
officer
in
the
rear
but
if
he
were
gone
the
legionary
brigade
was
to
follow
soult
over
the
hills
towards
guimaraens
and
braga
and
endeavour
to
catch
up
his
rearguard
the
orders
arrived
too
late
murray
on
the
morning
of
the
fourteenth
learnt
that
loison
had
long
ago
departed
and
that
soult
was
far
on
his
way
he
followed
the
marshal
across
the
serra
de
santa
catalina
but
never
got
near
him
though
he
picked
up
many
french
stragglers
and
saw
the
bodies
of
many
more
who
had
been
assassinated
by
the
peasantry
iv
afternoon
of
may
ibid
iv
morning
of
may
it
is
astonishing
to
find
that
murray
succeeded
in
taking
two
light
guns
over
this
difficult
path
the
fact
reflects
great
credit
on
his
gunners
meanwhile
beresford
had
acted
with
great
decision
and
with
an
intelligence
which
he
did
not
always
display
when
on
the
morning
of
the
thirteenth
he
found
that
the
french
had
disappeared
and
that
amarante
after
having
been
thoroughly
sacked
had
been
abandoned
to
him
he
did
not
waste
time
in
a
fruitless
pursuit
of
loison
in
the
direction
of
guimaraens
but
resolved
to
endeavour
to
cut
off
the
retreat
of
the
whole
french
army
towards
the
north
if
they
had
absconded
by
way
of
braga
the
chase
would
fall
to
wellesley
s
share
but
if
they
had
taken
the
other
road
by
chaves
all
would
depend
on
his
own
movements
accordingly
he
resolved
to
march
at
once
on
the
last
named
town
without
waiting
for
orders
from
the
having
hastily
collected
three
days
provisions
he
moved
off
himself
by
the
up
the
valley
of
the
tamega
detaching
silveira
and
his
division
to
strike
across
country
and
occupy
the
defiles
of
ruivaens
and
salamonde
on
the
road
where
it
would
be
possible
to
detain
if
not
to
stop
the
retreating
columns
of
soult
if
they
should
take
this
way
may
while
on
his
march
beresford
received
wellesley
s
letters
which
prescribed
to
him
exactly
the
line
of
conduct
that
he
had
already
determined
to
pursue
after
three
difficult
marches
in
drenching
rain
which
turned
every
rivulet
into
an
almost
impassable
torrent
and
spoilt
the
inadequate
provision
of
bread
which
had
been
served
out
to
the
men
the
division
reached
chaves
about
on
the
night
of
the
the
men
were
absolutely
exhausted
though
the
distance
covered
had
not
exceeded
some
fourteen
or
fifteen
miles
per
day
yet
the
rain
the
starvation
and
the
bad
road
had
much
thinned
the
ranks
and
those
who
had
kept
up
with
the
colours
were
dropping
with
fatigue
the
slowness
of
the
column
s
advance
was
certainly
not
beresford
s
fault
he
had
allowed
only
a
six
hours
halt
each
day
on
the
fourteenth
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
and
had
been
pushing
on
as
hard
as
was
humanly
speaking
possible
nevertheless
he
was
too
late
on
the
seventeenth
the
day
of
the
campaign
he
held
chaves
but
his
troops
were
too
tired
to
start
early
or
to
march
far
the
bad
weather
which
made
the
french
retreat
so
miserable
had
at
least
saved
the
flying
army
from
its
pursuers
the
state
of
amarante
was
dreadful
i
was
never
witness
to
such
a
scene
of
misery
and
horror
as
here
presented
itself
says
lord
gough
in
an
unpublished
letter
to
his
father
every
house
and
public
building
of
every
description
with
the
exception
of
a
monastery
which
covered
the
passage
of
the
bridge
a
chapel
and
about
five
detached
houses
was
burnt
to
the
ground
with
many
of
the
late
inhabitants
lying
dead
in
the
the
best
testimony
to
beresford
s
good
conduct
is
that
wellesley
iv
says
that
he
had
exactly
anticipated
the
instructions
sent
him
and
carried
them
out
on
his
own
initiative
napier
s
criticism
ii
is
unfair
and
misleading
the
best
account
of
beresford
s
forced
march
is
to
be
found
in
the
unpublished
letter
of
lord
gough
then
major
of
the
which
as
i
have
already
mentioned
has
been
shown
me
by
rait
of
new
college
he
says
the
business
of
crossing
the
river
took
the
brigade
tilson
s
four
hours
the
evening
set
in
with
a
most
dreadful
fall
of
rain
which
continued
all
night
and
the
next
three
days
and
nights
our
road
lay
over
almost
impassable
mountains
made
more
so
by
the
rain
that
swelled
the
mountain
rivulets
into
rivers
in
the
dark
many
men
lost
the
column
several
fell
into
pits
excavated
by
the
falling
water
many
lay
down
in
the
road
from
fatigue
and
hunger
and
the
greater
part
lost
their
shoes
next
day
we
pursued
our
melancholy
march
at
five
o
clock
the
men
nearly
fainting
with
hunger
about
twelve
we
fell
in
with
some
cars
of
bread
belonging
to
a
portuguese
division
which
tilson
pressed
for
the
men
this
with
some
wine
enabled
us
to
proceed
and
that
night
at
twelve
we
reached
chaves
after
a
forced
march
of
three
days
with
only
twelve
hours
halt
the
men
were
without
a
shoe
to
their
feet
and
hundreds
fallen
out
from
fatigue
and
hunger
the
had
of
with
which
they
joined
us
only
in
the
ranks
part
of
the
officers
and
nearly
all
the
men
had
their
feet
cut
to
the
bone
for
want
of
soult
meanwhile
had
gathered
in
loison
and
lorges
and
his
whole
army
was
concentrated
at
guimaraens
on
the
morning
of
the
fourteenth
from
the
point
where
he
now
lay
in
the
upper
valley
of
the
avé
there
are
only
two
carriage
roads
that
to
amarante
by
which
loison
had
arrived
and
that
to
braga
there
was
a
bare
chance
that
if
wellesley
had
received
his
information
late
and
moved
slowly
it
might
be
possible
to
escape
from
him
by
the
road
to
braga
if
however
he
had
marched
promptly
from
oporto
he
would
be
able
to
intercept
the
retreating
army
at
that
place
soult
refused
to
take
this
risk
and
resolved
instead
to
plunge
once
more
into
the
mountains
and
to
cross
the
watershed
between
the
avé
and
the
cavado
by
a
rugged
no
better
than
that
which
had
served
him
between
penafiel
and
guimaraens
it
was
accordingly
necessary
to
sacrifice
all
the
guns
munitions
and
baggage
belonging
to
loison
and
lorges
just
as
those
of
mermet
and
delaborde
had
been
destroyed
on
the
banks
of
the
souza
the
guns
were
burst
the
ammunition
exploded
the
baggage
piled
in
heaps
and
burned
after
this
second
holocaust
the
army
struck
up
a
track
by
the
salto
torrent
which
ultimately
brought
them
over
the
crest
and
down
upon
the
village
of
lanhozo
eight
miles
from
braga
and
just
at
the
foot
of
the
position
which
eben
had
occupied
during
his
unhappy
battle
on
march
the
weather
had
been
abominable
and
the
rearguard
had
been
forced
to
bivouac
in
misery
on
the
hills
the
darkness
having
come
down
upon
them
before
the
descent
into
the
valley
of
the
cavado
was
completed
next
morning
soult
sent
out
lahoussaye
s
dragoons
down
the
valley
of
the
cavado
towards
braga
to
see
if
that
city
was
already
in
wellesley
s
hands
or
whether
it
was
still
possible
to
escape
across
his
front
and
gain
the
high
road
to
galicia
as
the
marshal
had
feared
would
be
the
case
they
met
british
light
cavalry
pushing
briskly
up
the
road
towards
them
it
was
clear
that
the
pursuers
were
already
in
braga
and
soult
at
once
ordered
his
columns
to
turn
their
faces
to
the
and
follow
the
road
up
the
cavado
towards
salamonde
and
ruivaens
the
british
were
ere
long
visible
in
close
pursuit
sir
arthur
had
quitted
oporto
on
the
fourteenth
with
his
whole
force
except
the
brigade
of
murray
which
had
already
gone
forth
on
the
eastern
line
of
pursuit
and
the
light
dragoons
which
he
had
been
ordered
to
send
back
to
lisbon
on
that
day
his
army
covered
miles
of
road
in
vile
weather
and
slept
at
villa
nova
de
famelicção
on
the
fifteenth
the
british
started
early
and
their
vanguard
had
already
marched
twelve
miles
and
reached
braga
when
the
french
dragoons
were
descried
the
latter
seeing
themselves
forestalled
retired
on
their
main
body
and
when
wellesley
s
men
mounted
the
crest
of
the
monte
adaufé
eben
s
old
position
in
the
battle
of
march
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
whole
french
army
retiring
up
the
valley
soult
immediately
on
hearing
that
the
pursuers
were
in
braga
had
commenced
a
new
retreat
he
had
rearranged
his
order
of
march
loison
now
led
the
column
with
heudelet
s
division
and
lorges
dragoons
then
came
the
droves
of
artillery
horses
and
with
the
reserve
ammunition
and
the
little
baggage
that
had
been
saved
followed
by
delaborde
and
mermet
merle
s
infantry
and
franceschi
s
horse
were
in
the
rear
under
the
marshal
s
own
command
in
this
order
the
french
remounted
the
stream
of
the
cavado
as
far
as
salamonde
where
the
broad
valley
narrows
down
to
a
defile
they
were
followed
by
the
british
light
dragoons
but
the
infantry
of
the
pursuing
column
had
not
got
far
beyond
braga
where
wellesley
s
head
quarters
were
established
that
night
murray
s
german
brigade
which
had
crossed
the
mountains
from
guimaraens
in
soult
s
wake
joined
the
main
body
on
this
evening
on
reaching
salamonde
soult
was
informed
by
the
cavalry
in
his
front
that
they
had
been
brought
to
stand
at
the
bridge
of
ponte
nova
a
few
miles
up
the
defile
by
a
body
of
who
had
taken
up
the
wooden
flooring
of
the
bridge
torn
down
its
balustrades
and
barricaded
themselves
upon
the
further
side
unless
they
could
be
dislodged
ruin
stared
the
marshal
in
the
face
for
the
british
were
close
in
his
rear
and
there
was
no
lateral
line
of
escape
from
the
precipitous
defile
surrender
next
morning
must
follow
in
this
crisis
soult
saw
no
chance
of
safety
before
him
save
a
dash
at
the
bridge
when
darkness
had
fallen
he
sent
for
major
dulong
an
officer
of
the
léger
who
enjoyed
the
reputation
of
being
the
most
daring
man
in
the
whole
army
and
told
him
that
he
must
surprise
the
portuguese
by
a
sudden
rush
at
midnight
and
win
the
passage
at
all
costs
he
was
allowed
to
pick
volunteers
from
his
own
regiment
for
the
enterprise
the
safety
of
a
whole
army
has
seldom
depended
upon
a
more
desperate
venture
than
that
which
dulong
took
in
hand
nothing
remained
of
the
bridge
save
the
two
large
no
more
than
three
or
four
feet
broad
they
were
slippery
with
continuous
rain
and
had
to
be
passed
in
complete
darkness
under
the
driving
sleet
of
a
bitter
north
wind
fortunately
for
the
assailants
the
same
cold
and
wet
which
made
their
enterprise
so
dangerous
had
driven
the
under
cover
they
had
retired
to
some
huts
a
little
way
beyond
the
bridge
if
they
left
any
one
on
guard
the
sentinel
had
followed
his
friends
for
when
dulong
and
his
party
crept
up
to
the
passage
they
found
it
absolutely
deserted
they
crossed
in
single
file
and
reached
the
further
side
unobserved
losing
one
man
who
slipped
and
fell
into
the
fierce
river
below
a
moment
later
they
came
on
the
portuguese
who
were
surprised
in
their
sleep
many
were
bayonetted
the
rest
fled
in
dismay
they
were
but
a
few
score
of
peasants
and
were
helpless
when
once
the
passage
had
been
won
for
six
hours
soult
s
sappers
were
working
hard
to
replace
the
flooring
of
the
ruined
bridge
with
tree
trunks
and
boards
torn
from
the
houses
of
the
neighbouring
village
at
eight
it
was
practicable
and
the
troops
began
to
cross
it
was
a
long
business
for
men
with
cavalry
horses
and
a
great
drove
of
had
to
be
passed
over
the
narrow
rickety
and
uneven
structure
whose
balustrades
had
not
been
replaced
all
the
day
was
spent
in
hurrying
the
troops
across
but
they
got
forward
so
slowly
that
soult
saw
himself
forced
to
place
a
strong
rearguard
in
position
to
hold
back
the
pursuers
till
the
main
body
was
safe
he
left
behind
a
brigade
of
merle
s
division
and
two
of
franceschi
s
cavalry
regiments
ranged
behind
a
lateral
ravine
which
crosses
the
road
some
distance
below
the
bridge
they
were
placed
with
their
right
on
the
rough
river
bank
and
their
left
on
the
cliffs
which
overhang
the
road
orders
were
given
to
the
effect
that
they
must
hold
on
at
all
costs
till
the
army
had
completed
the
passage
of
the
ponte
nova
at
one
the
british
light
dragoons
arrived
in
front
of
the
position
saw
that
they
could
not
force
it
and
started
a
bickering
fire
with
the
french
pickets
while
they
waited
for
the
main
body
to
come
up
owing
to
the
long
distance
which
wellesley
s
infantry
had
to
cover
the
day
wore
on
without
any
serious
collision
on
this
point
but
meanwhile
soult
found
that
another
and
more
serious
danger
lay
ahead
of
him
after
crossing
the
cavado
at
the
ponte
nova
there
were
two
paths
available
for
the
army
the
main
road
leads
eastward
to
chaves
by
way
of
ruivaens
a
branch
however
turns
off
north
to
montalegre
and
the
sources
of
the
misarella
the
main
affluent
of
the
cavado
the
former
was
the
easier
but
there
was
a
grave
doubt
whether
chaves
might
not
already
be
in
the
hands
of
beresford
and
his
turning
column
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
only
arrived
there
a
few
hours
after
soult
stood
uncertain
at
the
parting
of
the
ways
bearing
this
in
mind
the
marshal
resolved
to
take
the
more
rugged
and
difficult
path
but
when
loison
and
the
vanguard
were
engaged
in
it
they
found
that
the
bridge
over
the
misarella
the
as
it
was
called
from
the
bold
leap
which
its
single
arch
makes
across
the
torrent
was
held
against
them
again
it
was
only
with
that
the
army
had
to
deal
beresford
had
just
reached
chaves
but
his
troops
were
some
miles
further
back
silveira
who
ought
to
have
been
at
ruivaens
that
morning
had
not
appeared
at
all
but
major
warre
an
officer
of
beresford
s
staff
had
ridden
ahead
to
rouse
the
peasantry
and
had
collected
several
hundred
levies
at
the
bridge
which
he
encouraged
them
to
hold
promising
that
the
regulars
would
be
up
to
support
them
before
nightfall
unfortunately
he
could
not
persuade
them
to
destroy
the
bridge
on
which
all
the
of
the
misarella
valley
depend
but
they
had
thrown
down
its
parapets
built
an
across
its
head
and
thrown
up
earthworks
on
each
side
of
it
so
as
to
command
the
opposite
bank
this
unhappily
was
not
enough
to
hold
back
desperate
men
who
saw
their
only
way
of
salvation
on
the
opposite
bank
when
loison
found
his
advance
barred
he
made
an
appeal
to
that
same
major
dulong
who
had
forced
the
ponte
nova
on
the
preceding
night
again
that
daring
soldier
volunteered
to
conduct
the
forlorn
hope
he
was
given
a
company
of
to
lead
the
column
and
two
battalions
of
heudelet
s
division
to
back
them
forming
the
whole
in
one
continuous
mass
there
was
only
room
for
four
men
abreast
he
dashed
down
towards
the
bridge
amid
a
spluttering
and
ineffective
fire
from
the
portuguese
entrenchments
on
the
opposite
bank
the
column
reached
the
arch
passed
it
was
checked
but
a
moment
while
tearing
down
the
and
then
plunged
in
among
the
scared
who
fled
in
every
direction
leaving
the
passage
free
dulong
was
wounded
but
no
more
than
eighteen
of
his
companions
were
hit
and
at
this
small
sacrifice
the
army
was
saved
late
in
the
afternoon
the
whole
mass
began
to
stream
up
the
montalegre
road
they
had
no
longer
anything
more
to
fear
than
stray
shots
from
the
scattered
who
hung
about
on
the
hillsides
firing
into
the
column
from
inaccessible
rocks
but
doing
little
damage
if
dulong
had
failed
at
the
saltador
soult
would
have
been
lost
for
just
as
the
passage
was
forced
the
rumbling
of
cannon
began
to
be
heard
from
the
rear
merle
was
attacked
by
the
british
and
was
being
driven
in
at
five
o
clock
the
guards
brigade
forming
the
head
of
wellesley
s
infantry
had
come
up
with
the
french
rearguard
it
was
formidably
posted
but
sir
arthur
thought
that
it
might
be
dislodged
accordingly
he
placed
the
two
which
accompanied
the
column
on
the
high
road
and
began
to
batter
the
french
centre
while
he
sent
off
the
three
light
companies
of
the
brigade
to
turn
the
french
left
flank
on
the
cliffs
to
the
south
when
the
crackling
of
their
musketry
was
heard
among
the
rocks
he
silenced
his
guns
and
flung
the
guards
upon
the
enemy
s
main
body
they
broke
turned
and
fled
in
confusion
though
the
regiment
on
the
road
the
léger
was
considered
one
of
the
best
in
the
french
army
the
brigade
had
a
company
of
the
attached
so
had
three
instead
of
two
light
companies
il

à
l
apparition

il
s
est
débandé
sans
qu
on
ait
pu

la
confusion
qui
a
été

de
cette
terreur
panique
a
été
épouvantable
fantassins
et
cavaliers
se
précipitaient
les

sur
les

jetaient
leurs
armes
et
luttaient
à
qui
courrait
le
plus
vite
le
pont
étroit
et
sans

ne
pouvait
suffire
à
l
impatience
des
fuyards
ils
se
pressaient
tellement
que

d

furent
précipités
et
noyés
dans
le
torrent

écrasés
sous
les
pieds
des
chevaux
si
les
anglais
avaient
été
en

de
profiter
de

épouvante
je
ne

en

ce
que
nous
serions
devenus
tant
la
peur
est
contagieuse
même
chez
les
plus
braves
fantin
des
odoards
the
chase
continued
as
far
as
the
ponte
nova
which
the
broken
troops
crossed
in
a
struggling
mass
thrusting
each
other
over
the
edge
where
the
balustrades
were
wanting
till
the
torrent
below
was
choked
with
dead
men
and
horses
the
british
guns
were
brought
up
and
played
upon
the
weltering
crowd
with
dreadful
effect
but
the
night
was
already
coming
on
and
the
darkness
hid
from
the
pursuers
the
full
effect
of
their
own
fire
they
halted
and
encamped
having
slain
many
and
taken
about
fifty
prisoners
of
whom
one
was
an
officer
it
was
only
at
daybreak
that
they
realized
the
terrors
through
which
the
french
had
passed
the
rocky
bed
of
the
cavado
says
an
presented
an
extraordinary
spectacle
men
and
horses
sumpter
animals
and
baggage
had
been
precipitated
into
the
river
and
literally
choked
its
course
here
with
these
fatal
accompaniments
of
death
and
dismay
was
disgorged
the
last
of
the
plunder
of
oporto
all
kinds
of
valuable
goods
were
left
on
the
road
while
above
horses
sunk
in
the
water
and
mules
laden
with
baggage
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
grenadier
and
light
companies
of
the
guards
these
gentry
found
that
fishing
for
boxes
and
bodies
out
of
the
stream
produced
pieces
of
plate
and
purses
and
belts
full
of
gold
money
amid
the
scenes
of
death
and
desolation
arose
their
shouts
of
the
most
noisy
merriment
lord
munster
s
of
pp
on
the
night
of
the
soult
s
army
poured
into
montalegre
a
dilapidated
old
town
on
the
edge
of
the
frontier
from
which
all
the
inhabitants
had
fled
little
or
no
food
could
be
procured
and
the
houses
did
not
suffice
to
shelter
more
than
a
part
of
the
troops
next
morning
the
corps
took
to
its
heels
once
more
and
climbed
the
serra
de
gerez
which
lies
just
above
the
town
on
descending
its
northern
slope
they
had
at
last
entered
spain
and
had
reached
safety
but
the
country
was
absolutely
desolate
for
twenty
miles
beyond
montalegre
there
was
hardly
a
single
village
on
this
rugged
still
dreading
pursuit
the
marshal
urged
on
his
men
as
fast
as
they
could
be
driven
forward
and
in
two
long
marches
at
last
reached
orense
wellesley
however
had
given
up
any
hope
of
catching
the
corps
when
once
it
had
passed
the
saltador
and
reached
the
spanish
frontier
he
had
halted
the
british
infantry
at
ruivaens
and
only
sent
on
in
chase
of
the
flying
host
the
light
dragoons
and
the
division
of
silveira
which
had
at
last
appeared
on
the
scene
late
in
the
evening
of
the
seventeenth
what
this
corps
had
been
doing
during
the
last
hours
it
is
impossible
to
discover
it
had
started
from
amarante
on
the
same
day
that
beresford
marched
for
chaves
and
ought
to
have
been
at
ruivaens
on
the
sixteenth
when
it
would
have
found
itself
just
in
time
to
intercept
soult
s
vanguard
after
it
had
passed
the
ponte
nova
apparently
the
same
wild
weather
and
constant
rain
which
had
delayed
beresford
s
column
had
checked
his
subordinate
at
any
rate
it
is
certain
that
silveira
though
he
had
a
shorter
route
than
his
chief
only
got
to
ruivaens
late
on
the
seventeenth
while
the
other
column
had
reached
chaves
more
than
twelve
hours
earlier
the
french
had
disappeared
and
it
was
only
next
morning
that
silveira
followed
them
up
on
the
montalegre
road
he
captured
a
few
laggards
by
the
way
but
on
reaching
the
little
town
found
that
soult
s
rearguard
had
quitted
it
two
hours
before
his
arrival
by
wellesley
s
orders
he
pushed
on
for
one
day
more
in
pursuit
but
found
that
the
enemy
was
now
so
far
ahead
that
he
could
do
no
more
than
pick
up
moribund
stragglers
on
the
nineteenth
therefore
he
turned
back
and
retraced
his
steps
to
montalegre
the
french
rearguard
actually
saw
silveira
arriving
naylies
for
this
part
of
the
pursuit
see
the
diary
of
hawker
of
the
light
dragoons
who
returned
to
montalegre
with
silveira
s
men
much
the
same
fortune
had
befallen
beresford
s
column
by
wellesley
s
orders
tilson
s
brigade
and
their
portuguese
companions
marched
from
chaves
by
monterey
on
the
eighteenth
on
the
chance
that
soult
after
passing
the
serra
de
gerez
might
drop
into
the
road
but
the
marshal
had
not
taken
this
route
he
had
kept
to
and
marched
by
porquera
and
allariz
to
the
left
of
the
line
on
which
beresford
s
pursuit
was
directed
at
ginzo
the
cavalry
of
the
pursuing
column
picked
up
fifty
stragglers
and
came
into
contact
with
a
small
party
of
franceschi
s
which
soult
had
thrown
out
to
cover
his
flank
learning
from
the
peasantry
that
the
french
had
gone
off
by
a
different
route
beresford
halted
and
returned
to
chaves
his
men
were
so
thoroughly
worn
out
and
the
strength
of
the
column
was
so
much
reduced
that
he
could
have
done
little
more
even
if
he
had
come
upon
the
main
body
of
the
enemy
these
details
are
mainly
from
the
letter
of
gough
of
the
which
i
have
already
had
occasion
to
quote
when
dealing
with
beresford
s
movements
i
can
not
find
any
corroboration
for
napier
s
account
of
beresford
s
and
silveira
s
pursuit
in
ii
pp
of
his
history
illustration
northern
portugal
to
illustrate
marshal
soult
s
campaign
of
march
to
may
on
may
soult
s
dilapidated
and
starving
host
poured
into
orense
where
they
could
at
last
take
a
day
s
rest
and
obtain
a
decent
meal
the
marshal
caused
the
troops
to
be
numbered
and
found
that
he
had
brought
back
men
as
he
had
started
from
the
spanish
frontier
with
sabres
and
bayonets
and
had
received
more
from
tuy
when
lamartinière
s
column
joined
him
it
would
appear
that
he
had
left
in
all
some
men
behind
him
of
these
according
to
the
french
accounts
about
had
fallen
in
the
early
fighting
or
died
of
sickness
before
wellesley
s
appearance
on
the
vouga
about
mostly
convalescents
had
been
captured
at
chaves
by
silveira
after
the
storm
of
oporto
the
british
army
found
sick
in
the
hospitals
of
that
city
of
braga
and
of
viana
they
also
took
some
unwounded
prisoners
at
oporto
and
at
grijon
it
results
therefore
that
the
losses
of
the
actual
retreat
from
baltar
to
orense
between
the
thirteenth
and
the
nineteenth
of
may
must
have
been
rather
more
than
men
but
all
these
had
been
the
sick
as
we
have
seen
were
abandoned
before
the
march
over
the
mountains
began
adding
them
and
the
prisoners
of
the
to
the
actual
casualties
of
the
retreat
on
the
same
principle
which
we
used
when
calculating
the
losses
of
moore
s
army
in
the
corunna
campaign
we
should
get
a
total
of
for
the
deficiency
in
the
french
ranks
during
the
nine
days
which
elapsed
between
wellesley
s
passage
of
the
vouga
and
soult
s
arrival
at
orense
thus
it
would
seem
that
about
of
the
corps
had
been
destroyed
in
that
short
time
a
proportion
almost
exactly
corresponding
to
that
which
moore
s
force
left
behind
it
in
the
retreat
from
sahagun
to
corunna
wherein
men
out
of
were
lost
see
mainly
le
noble
s
calculation
on
pp
of
his
de
the
rest
of
silveira
s
prisoners
were
legionaries
see
napier
ii
says
at
viana
and
braga
at
oporto
figures
that
should
be
reversed
for
at
the
two
last
places
only
the
sick
of
heudelet
s
and
lorges
divisions
were
captured
while
at
oporto
the
main
central
hospital
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
british
le
noble
says
that
there
were
men
in
hospital
altogether
on
may
see
in
other
respects
these
two
famous
retreats
afford
some
interesting
points
of
comparison
moore
had
an
infinitely
longer
distance
to
cover
in
mere
mileage
his
men
marched
more
than
twice
as
far
as
soult
s
their
journey
occupied
twenty
days
as
against
nine
on
the
other
hand
the
french
had
to
use
far
worse
roads
from
benavente
to
corunna
there
is
a
good
for
the
whole
distance
from
baltar
to
orense
the
corps
had
to
follow
impracticable
for
more
than
half
the
way
as
to
the
weather
there
was
perhaps
little
to
choose
between
the
two
retreats
the
nine
days
of
perpetual
rain
during
which
soult
effected
his
passage
of
four
successive
mountain
chains
was
almost
as
trying
as
the
cold
and
snow
through
which
the
british
had
to
trudge
moore
s
men
were
not
so
hardly
pressed
by
starvation
as
the
corps
and
they
were
moving
through
a
which
was
not
actively
hostile
if
it
could
scarcely
be
described
as
friendly
on
the
other
hand
they
were
pursued
with
far
greater
vigour
than
the
french
their
rearguard
was
beset
every
day
and
had
constantly
to
be
fighting
while
soult
s
troops
were
hard
pressed
only
on
two
days
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
of
may
this
advantage
the
marshal
gained
by
choosing
an
unexpected
line
of
retreat
over
obscure
if
he
had
taken
either
of
the
by
braga
and
chaves
his
fate
would
have
been
very
different
on
this
same
choice
of
roads
depends
another
contrast
between
the
two
retreats
to
gain
speed
and
safety
soult
sacrificed
the
whole
of
his
artillery
and
his
transport
when
he
arrived
at
orense
as
one
of
his
officers
wrote
the
infantry
had
brought
off
their
bayonets
and
their
eagles
the
cavalry
their
horses
and
saddles
everything
else
had
been
left
behind
the
guns
the
stores
the
treasure
the
moore
in
spite
of
all
the
miseries
of
his
march
carried
down
to
corunna
the
whole
of
his
artillery
part
of
his
transport
and
the
greater
number
of
his
sick
and
wounded
if
he
lost
his
military
chest
it
was
not
from
necessity
but
from
the
mismanagement
of
the
subordinates
who
had
charge
of
it
his
army
was
in
condition
to
fight
a
successful
battle
at
the
end
of
its
retreat
and
so
to
win
for
itself
a
safe
and
honourable
departure
the
respective
distances
seem
to
be
about
and
miles
both
generals
it
will
be
observed
were
driven
into
danger
by
causes
for
which
they
did
not
regard
themselves
as
responsible
soult
was
placed
in
peril
by
attempting
to
carry
out
his
master
s
impracticable
orders
moore
thought
himself
bound
to
run
the
risk
because
he
had
realized
that
there
was
a
political
necessity
that
the
english
army
should
do
something
for
the
cause
of
spain
for
it
could
not
with
honour
retire
to
portugal
before
it
had
struck
a
blow
in
their
management
of
their
respective
campaigns
both
made
mistakes
moore
hurried
his
men
too
much
and
did
not
take
full
advantage
of
the
many
positions
in
which
he
could
have
held
off
the
pursuer
by
judicious
rearguard
actions
soult
s
faults
were
even
greater
nothing
can
excuse
his
stay
at
oporto
during
the
days
when
he
should
have
been
directing
loison
s
movements
at
amarante
that
stay
was
undoubtedly
due
to
his
vain
intrigues
with
the
portuguese
malcontents
it
was
personal
ambition
not
any
military
necessity
which
detained
him
from
his
proper
place
still
more
worthy
of
blame
was
his
disposition
of
his
forces
at
the
moment
when
the
british
troops
crossed
the
vouga
they
were
scattered
in
a
dangerous
fashion
which
made
concentration
difficult
and
uncertain
but
the
weakest
feature
of
his
whole
conduct
was
that
he
allowed
himself
to
be
surprised
in
oporto
by
wellesley
on
may
when
an
army
in
close
touch
with
the
enemy
is
taken
unawares
at
broad
midday
by
an
irruption
of
its
opponents
into
the
middle
of
the
cantonments
the
can
not
shift
the
blame
on
to
the
shoulders
of
subordinates
it
was
soult
s
duty
to
see
that
his
officers
were
taking
all
reasonable
precautions
to
watch
the
british
and
he
most
certainly
did
not
do
so
indeed
we
have
seen
that
he
turned
all
his
attention
to
the
point
of
least
danger
the
lower
reaches
of
the
douro
and
neglected
that
on
which
the
british
attack
was
really
delivered
it
was
only
when
he
found
himself
on
the
verge
of
utter
ruin
on
may
that
he
rose
to
the
occasion
and
saved
his
army
by
the
daring
march
upon
guimaraens
which
foiled
wellesley
s
plans
for
intercepting
his
retreat
to
state
that
his
reputation
as
a
general
was
nowise
diminished
by
his
portuguese
campaign
is
to
do
him
more
than
justice
it
would
be
more
true
to
assert
that
he
showed
that
if
he
could
commit
faults
he
could
also
do
much
towards
repairing
their
consequences
napier
ii
as
to
wellesley
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
the
oporto
campaign
is
one
of
his
strongest
titles
to
fame
he
had
as
we
have
already
seen
only
british
and
portuguese
troops
of
whom
the
latter
were
either
untried
in
the
field
or
demoralized
by
their
previous
experiences
beyond
the
douro
his
superiority
in
mere
numbers
to
soult
s
corps
of
men
was
therefore
small
and
he
was
lamentably
destitute
of
cavalry
and
artillery
it
was
no
small
feat
to
expel
the
enemy
from
northern
portugal
in
nine
days
and
to
cast
him
into
galicia
stripped
of
his
guns
and
baggage
and
with
a
gap
of
more
than
men
in
his
ranks
this
had
been
accomplished
at
the
expense
of
no
more
than
casualties
even
when
the
soldiers
who
fell
by
the
way
from
sickness
and
fatigue
are
added
to
the
killed
and
wounded
of
the
engagements
of
may
and
there
is
hardly
a
campaign
in
history
in
which
so
much
was
accomplished
at
so
small
a
cost
wellesley
had
exactly
carried
out
the
programme
which
he
had
set
before
himself
when
he
left
lisbon
the
defeat
of
the
enemy
and
the
deliverance
of
the
two
provinces
beyond
the
douro
he
had
expressly
disclaimed
any
intention
or
expectation
of
destroying
or
capturing
the
corps
which
some
foreign
critics
have
ascribed
to
him
in
their
anxiety
to
make
out
that
he
failed
to
execute
the
whole
project
that
he
had
taken
in
hand
see
in
respect
to
soult
i
shall
omit
nothing
that
i
can
do
to
destroy
him
but
i
am
afraid
that
with
the
force
i
have
at
my
disposal
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
prevent
him
retreating
into
wellesley
to
frere
may
there
was
it
is
true
one
short
moment
at
which
he
had
it
in
his
power
to
deal
soult
a
heavier
blow
than
he
had
contemplated
on
the
night
of
may
when
the
marshal
in
his
bivouac
at
baltar
learnt
of
loison
s
evacuation
of
amarante
the
main
body
of
the
corps
was
in
a
deplorable
situation
and
must
have
been
destroyed
had
the
british
been
close
at
hand
if
wellesley
had
pursued
the
flying
foe
on
the
afternoon
of
the
victory
of
oporto
with
all
his
cavalry
and
the
less
fatigued
regiments
of
his
infantry
nothing
could
have
saved
the
french
but
the
opportunity
was
one
which
could
not
have
been
foreseen
no
rational
officer
could
have
guessed
that
loison
would
evacuate
amarante
and
so
surrender
his
chief
s
best
line
of
retreat
it
was
impossible
that
wellesley
should
dream
of
such
a
chance
being
thrown
into
his
hands
he
constructed
his
plans
on
the
natural
hypothesis
that
soult
had
still
open
to
him
the
route
across
the
tamega
and
he
was
therefore
more
concerned
with
the
idea
that
beresford
might
be
in
danger
from
the
approach
of
soult
than
with
that
of
taking
measures
to
capture
the
marshal
his
men
were
fatigued
with
the
long
march
of
eighty
miles
in
four
days
which
had
taken
them
from
the
mondego
to
oporto
his
guns
and
stores
had
not
yet
passed
the
bridgeless
douro
it
was
natural
therefore
that
he
should
allow
himself
and
his
army
a
night
s
rest
before
pressing
on
in
pursuit
of
soult
it
will
be
remembered
that
he
did
push
murray
s
brigade
along
the
baltar
road
in
the
tracks
of
the
marshal
but
that
officer
never
came
up
with
the
french
if
blame
has
to
be
allotted
to
any
one
for
the
failure
to
discover
the
unhappy
situation
of
the
corps
upon
the
morning
of
the
thirteenth
it
would
seem
that
murray
must
bear
the
burden
rather
than
the
he
should
have
kept
touch
at
all
costs
with
the
retreating
french
and
if
he
had
done
so
would
have
been
able
to
give
wellesley
news
of
their
desperate
plight
as
to
the
pursuit
of
soult
between
the
fourteenth
and
the
eighteenth
it
is
hard
to
see
that
more
could
have
been
done
than
was
actually
accomplished
it
is
obvious
as
wellesley
wrote
to
castlereagh
that
if
an
army
throws
away
all
its
cannon
equipment
and
baggage
and
everything
that
can
strengthen
it
and
enable
it
to
act
together
as
a
body
and
if
it
abandons
all
those
who
are
entitled
to
its
protection
but
add
to
its
weight
and
impede
its
progress
it
must
be
able
to
march
by
roads
on
which
it
can
not
be
followed
with
any
prospect
of
being
overtaken
by
an
army
which
has
not
made
the
same
sacrifices
this
puts
the
case
in
a
nutshell
soult
after
he
had
abandoned
his
sick
and
destroyed
his
guns
and
wagons
could
go
much
faster
than
his
pursuers
the
only
chance
of
catching
him
was
that
beresford
or
silveira
might
be
able
to
intercept
him
at
the
misarella
on
the
seventeenth
but
the
troops
of
the
former
were
so
exhausted
by
their
long
march
in
the
rain
from
amarante
that
although
they
reached
chaves
on
the
night
of
the
they
were
not
in
a
condition
to
march
eighteen
miles
further
on
the
following
morning
whether
silveira
who
had
taken
a
shorter
but
a
more
rugged
route
than
beresford
might
not
have
reached
ruivaens
ten
or
twelve
hours
earlier
than
he
did
is
another
matter
had
he
done
so
he
might
have
held
the
and
blocked
the
way
to
montalegre
we
have
no
details
of
his
march
though
we
know
that
he
had
a
bad
to
traverse
in
abominable
weather
all
military
critics
have
joined
in
condemning
him
but
without
a
more
accurate
knowledge
of
the
obstacles
that
he
had
to
cross
and
of
the
state
of
his
troops
we
can
not
be
sure
of
the
exact
amount
of
blame
that
should
fall
upon
him
it
is
at
any
rate
clear
that
wellesley
was
not
responsible
for
the
late
arrival
of
the
portuguese
division

the
consequent
escape
of
the
enemy
from
montalegre
may
its
sick
and
wounded
napier
arteche
and
schepeler
all
agree
in
this
the
former
only
making
the
excuse
that
silveira
may
not
have
fully
understood
beresford
s
orders
owing
to
the
difficulty
of
language
but
beresford
spoke
and
wrote
portuguese
fluently
erratum
from
xii
a
dispatch
of
beresford
at
lisbon
clears
up
my
doubts
as
to
silveira
s
culpability
beresford
complains
that
the
latter
lost
a
whole
day
by
marching
from
amarante
to
villa
pouca
without
orders
the
dispatch
directing
him
to
take
the
path
by
mondim
thus
reached
him
only
when
he
had
gone
many
miles
on
the
wrong
road
the
time
lost
could
never
be
made
up
beyond
montalegre
it
would
have
been
useless
to
follow
the
flying
french
an
advance
into
galicia
would
have
taken
the
british
army
too
far
from
lisbon
and
have
rendered
it
impossible
to
return
in
time
to
the
tagus
if
victor
should
be
on
the
move
that
marshal
as
we
shall
see
was
showing
signs
of
stirring
from
his
long
spell
of
torpidity
and
it
was
a
dispatch
from
mackenzie
containing
the
news
that
the
corps
was
on
the
move
that
made
wellesley
specially
anxious
to
check
the
pursuit
and
to
draw
back
to
central
portugal
before
matters
should
come
to
a
head
in
estremadura
he
could
safely
calculate
that
it
would
be
months
rather
than
weeks
before
soult
would
be
in
a
condition
to
cause
any
trouble
on
the
northern
frontier
there
are
admirable
accounts
of
the
horrors
of
soult
s
retreat
in
the
works
of
le
noble
chamans
fantin
des
odoards
and
naylies
the
pursuit
of
the
main
body
of
the
english
army
is
well
described
by

and
la
romana
in
galicia
and
the
asturias
while
following
the
fortunes
of
soult
and
the
corps
in
northern
portugal
we
have
been
constrained
to
withdraw
our
attention
from
galicia
where
we
left
marshal
ney
busied
in
a
vain
attempt
to
beat
down
the
insurrections
which
had
sprung
up
in
every
corner
of
the
kingdom
at
the
moment
when
the
melting
of
the
snows
gave
notice
that
spring
was
at
hand
it
was
with
no
good
will
that
the
duke
of
elchingen
had
seen
his
colleague
depart
from
orense
and
plunge
into
the
portuguese
mountains
indeed
he
had
done
his
best
to
induce
soult
to
disregard
the
emperor
s
orders
and
to
join
him
in
a
strenuous
effort
to
pacify
galicia
before
embarking
on
the
march
to
oporto
when
he
found
that
his
appeal
had
failed
to
influence
the
duke
of
dalmatia
and
that
the
corps
had
passed
out
of
sight
and
left
the
whole
of
galicia
upon
his
hands
he
was
constrained
to
take
stock
of
his
position
and
to
think
out
a
plan
of
campaign
see
ney
had
at
his
disposal
some
men
consisting
of
the
infantry
battalions
of
his
own
corps
which
formed
the
two
divisions
of
marchand
and
maurice
mathieu
of
the
two
regiments
of
his
and
of
fournier
s
brigade
of
lorges
dragoons
which
soult
by
the
emperor
s
orders
had
transferred
to
him
before
crossing
the
minho
among
his
resources
it
would
not
be
fair
to
count
the
two
garrisons
at
vigo
and
tuy
which
the
corps
had
left
behind
it
they
numbered
more
than
men
but
were
so
placed
as
to
be
more
of
a
charge
than
a
help
to
ney
they
failed
to
keep
him
in
touch
with
soult
and
their
necessities
distracted
some
of
his
troops
to
their
aid
when
he
was
requiring
every
man
for
other
purposes
on
march
when
he
was
left
to
his
own
resources
ney
had
concentrated
the
greater
part
of
his
corps
in
the
corner
of
galicia
he
had
placed
one
brigade
at
lugo
a
second
with
fournier
s
dragoons
at
mondonedo
in
observation
of
the
asturias
a
third
at
santiago
the
remainder
at
corunna
and
ferrol
the
outlying
posts
had
been
called
in
save
a
garrison
at
villafranca
the
important
stage
between
lugo
and
astorga
where
the
marshal
had
left
a
battalion
of
the
regiment
to
keep
open
his
communication
with
the
plains
of
leon
the
insurgents
were
already
so
active
that
touch
with
this
detachment
was
soon
lost
the
peasants
having
cut
the
road
both
east
and
west
of
villafranca
the
whole
month
of
march
was
spent
in
a
ceaseless
endeavour
to
keep
down
the
rising
in
northern
galicia
the
southern
parts
of
the
kingdom
had
been
practically
abandoned
and
the
french
had
no
hold
there
save
through
the
garrisons
of
tuy
and
vigo
both
of
which
as
we
have
seen
in
an
earlier
chapter
were
blockaded
by
the
local
levies
the
moment
that
soult
had
passed
on
into
portugal
ney
s
object
was
to
crush
and
cow
the
insurgents
of
northern
galicia
by
the
constant
movement
of
flying
columns
which
marched
out
from
the
towns
when
his
brigades
were
established
and
made
descents
on
every
district
where
the
peasantry
had
assembled
in
strength
this
policy
had
little
success
it
was
easy
to
rout
the
galicians
and
to
burn
their
villages
but
the
moment
that
the
column
had
passed
on
the
enemy
returned
to
occupy
his
old
positions
the
campaign
was
endless
and
inconclusive
it
was
of
little
use
to
kill
so
many
scores
or
hundreds
of
peasants
if
no
attempt
was
made
to
hold
down
the
districts
through
which
the
expedition
had
passed
this
could
not
be
done
for
sheer
want
of
numbers
men
were
not
sufficient
to
garrison
the
whole
of
the
mountain
valleys
and
coast
villages
of
this
rugged
land
the
french
columns
went
far
afield
even
as
far
as
corcubion
on
the
headland
of
cape
finisterre
and
ribadeo
on
the
borders
of
asturias
but
though
they
scathed
the
whole
region
with
fire
and
sword
they
made
no
impression
moreover
they
suffered
serious
losses
every
expedition
lost
a
certain
number
of
stragglers
cut
off
by
the
peasantry
and
of
foragers
who
had
wandered
too
far
from
the
main
body
in
search
of
food
all
were
murdered
for
the
populace
mad
at
the
burning
of
their
homes
and
the
lifting
of
their
cattle
their
only
wealth
never
gave
quarter
to
the
unfortunate
soldiers
who
fell
into
their
hands
it
is
curious
and
interesting
to
compare
ney
s
actual
operations
with
the
orders
which
the
emperor
had
sent
to
him
in
these
he
was
directed
to
establish
his
head
quarters
at
lugo
and
to
leave
no
more
than
a
regiment
at
ferrol
and
another
regiment
at
betanzos
and
corunna
he
was
to
keep
a
movable
column
of
three
battalions
at
work
between
santiago
and
tuy
to
make
examples
and
prevent
the
english
from
landing
munitions
for
the
insurgents
with
the
rest
of
his
corps
five
regiments
of
infantry
and
a
brigade
of
cavalry
he
was
to
establish
himself
at
lugo
and
from
thence
to
send
out
punitive
expeditions
against
rebellious
villages
to
seize
hostages
to
lend
aid
if
necessary
to
soult
s
operations
in
portugal
and
finally
to
utilize
the
months
of
march
and
april
when
there
is
nothing
to
fear
on
the
galician
coasts
for
an
expedition
to
conquer
the
here
we
have
all
napoleon
s
illusions
concerning
the
character
of
the
peninsular
war
very
clearly
displayed
he
supposes
that
a
movable
column
of
one
regiment
can
hold
down
a
rugged
coast
region
one
hundred
miles
long
where
insurgents
are
in
arms
he
thinks
that
punitive
expeditions
and
the
taking
of
hostages
will
keep
a
province
quiet
without
there
being
any
need
to
establish
garrisons
in
it
organize
galicia
he
writes
make
examples
for
severe
examples
well
applied
are
much
more
effective
than
garrisons
leave
the
policing
of
the
country
to
the
spanish
authorities
if
you
can
not
occupy
every
place
you
can
watch
every
place
if
you
can
not
hold
every
to
prevent
communication
with
the
english
you
can
charge
the
natives
with
this
duty
your
movable
columns
will
punish
any
of
the
people
of
the
coast
who
behave
napoleon
to
ney
from
paris
to
ney
when
he
received
this
dispatch
many
weeks
after
it
had
been
written
all
this
elaborate
advice
must
have
appeared
very
futile
considering
the
present
attitude
of
the
whole
population
of
galicia
he
must
have
been
much
amused
at
the
proposal
that
he
should
entrust
them
with
the
task
of
keeping
off
the
british
should
organize
them
and
make
them
police
as
to
severe
examples
he
had
now
been
burning
villages
and
shooting
monks
and
alcaldes
for
two
months
and
more
but
the
only
result
was
that
the
insurrection
flared
up
more
fiercely
and
that
his
own
stragglers
and
foragers
were
being
hung
and
tortured
every
day
as
to
the
idea
of
movable
columns
he
had
on
his
own
inspiration
sent
maucune
to
carry
out
precisely
the
operations
that
the
emperor
desired
in
the
country
between
santiago
and
tuy
the
column
had
to
fight
every
day
and
held
down
not
one
foot
of
territory
beyond
the
outskirts
of
its
own
camp
and
now
in
the
midst
of
all
his
troubles
he
was
ordered
to
attempt
the
conquest
of
the
asturias
no
small
undertaking
in
itself
the
emperor
s
letter
ended
with
the
disquieting
note
that
no
further
reinforcements
can
be
sent
to
galicia
it
is
much
more
likely
that
it
may
be
necessary
to
transfer
to
some
other
point
one
of
the
two
divisions
of
the
sixth
corps

we
have
hitherto
had
little
occasion
to
mention
the
two
spanish
regular
armies
on
which
ney
in
addition
to
all
his
troubles
with
the
insurgents
had
to
keep
a
watchful
eye
the
first
was
the
force
in
the
principality
of
asturias
which
had
been
lost
to
sight
since
the
day
on
which
it
fled
homeward
after
the
battle
of
espinosa
the
second
consisted
of
the
troops
of
la
romana
who
since
their
escape
from
monterey
had
enjoyed
some
weeks
of
comparative
rest
and
were
once
more
ready
to
move
the
asturian
force
was
far
the
larger
in
point
of
numbers
and
ought
to
have
made
its
influence
felt
long
ere
now
but
even
more
than
the
other
spaniards
the
asturians
were
given
over
to
particularism
and
provincial
selfishness
in
they
had
done
nothing
for
the
common
cause
save
that
they
had
lent
the
single
division
of
acevedo
comprising
about
half
their
provincial
levy
to
the
army
which
blake
led
to
defeat
in
biscay
after
espinosa
this
corps
had
not
retired
with
la
romana
to
leon
but
had
fallen
back
within
the
frontier
of
its
native
principality
and
had
joined
the
large
reserve
which
had
never
gone
forward
from
oviedo
during
the
three
winter
months
the
asturians
had
contented
themselves
with
reorganizing
and
increasing
the
numbers
of
their
battalions
and
with
guarding
the
passes
of
the
cantabrian
chain
they
had
refused
to
send
either
men
or
money
to
la
romana
thereby
provoking
his
righteous
indignation
and
furnishing
him
with
a
grudge
which
he
repaid
in
due
season
when
he
was
driven
away
from
their
neighbourhood
and
forced
to
retire
towards
portugal
they
still
kept
quiet
behind
their
hills
and
made
but
the
weakest
of
attempts
to
distract
the
attention
of
the
enemy
there
were
at
first
no
french
forces
near
them
save
bonnet
s
single
division
at
santander
which
was
fully
occupied
in
holding
down
the
montaña
and
a
provisional
brigade
at
leon
consisting
of
some
stray
battalions
of
the
dissolved
eighth
corps
as
neither
of
these
forces
had
any
considerable
reserves
behind
them
when
once
ney
and
soult
had
passed
on
into
galicia
it
is
clear
that
a
demonstration
in
force
against
santander
or
leon
would
have
thrown
dismay
along
the
whole
line
of
the
french
communications
and
have
disarranged
all
the
emperor
s
plans
for
further
advance

in
all
the

till

nothing

came
up

only
operation

which
the
asturians
undertook

men
who
went
to
beat
up

detachment
at
mondonedo
on

and
were
driven
off
with
ease

had
fully

to
be

point

a
whole
army
was
wasted
by
being
distributed
all
along

narrow

an
attack

might
well
be

done
practically
nothing

since

to
have
to
represent
that
the
supplies
hitherto
granted
to
this
province
have
not
been
applied
to
use
the
mildest
expressions
with
that
judgment
and
economy
that
might
have
been
expected
and
that
the
benefits
resulting
to
this
province
and
the
common
cause
are
by
no
means
proportionate
to
the
liberality
with
which
those
supplies
were
granted
by
the
british
government
record
office
toreno
as
a
patriotic
asturian
hushes
up
all
these
scandals
ney
s
new
troubles
in
april
did
not
spring
from
the
activity
of
the
asturian
troops
but
from
that
of
the
army
of
galicia
which
was
destined
in
this
month
to
achieve
the
first
success
that
had
cheered
its
depleted
ranks
since
the
combat
of
guenes
when
la
romana
on
march
had
found
himself
free
from
the
pursuit
of
franceschi
s
cavalry
he
had
marched
by
leisurely
stages
to
puebla
de
senabria
on
the
borders
of
leon
he
doubted
for
a
moment
whether
he
should
not
turn
southward
and
drop
down
along
the
edge
of
portugal
to
ciudad
rodrigo
the
nearest
place
of
strength
in
spanish
hands
but
after
much
consideration
he
resolved
to
leave
behind
him
the
weakest
of
his
battalions
and
his
numerous
sick
together
with
his
small
provision
of
artillery
and
to
strike
back
into
galicia
with
the
best
of
his
men
it
would
seem
that
he
was
inspired
partly
by
the
desire
of
cutting
ney
s
communications
partly
by
the
wish
to
get
into
touch
with
the
asturians
whose
torpidity
he
was
determined
to
stir
up
into
action
accordingly
he
left
at
puebla
de
senabria
his
guns
and
about
men
the
skeletons
of
many
ruined
regiments
under
general
martin
la
carrera
while
with
the
infantry
that
remained
he
resolved
to
cross
the
sierra
negra
and
throw
himself
into
the
upper
valley
of
the
sil
the
road
by
corporales
and
the
sources
of
the
cabrera
torrent
proved
to
be
abominable
if
the
army
had
possessed
cannon
or
baggage
it
could
not
have
reached
its
goal
but
after
several
hard
marches
la
romana
descended
to
ponferrada
on
march
he
learnt
that
the
insurrection
had
compelled
the
french
to
concentrate
all
their
small
posts
and
that
there
was
no
enemy
nearer
than
villafranca
on
the
one
hand
and
astorga
on
the
other
thus
he
found
himself
able
to
take
possession
of
the
from
astorga
to
lugo
and
to
make
use
of
all
the
resources
of
the
vierzo
and
of
eastern
galicia
he
might
have
passed
on
undisturbed
if
he
had
chosen
to
join
the
asturians
but
learning
that
the
french
garrison
at
villafranca
was
completely
isolated
he
resolved
to
risk
a
blow
at
it
in
the
hopes
that
he
might
reduce
it
before
ney
could
learn
of
his
arrival
and
come
down
from
lugo
to
its
aid
he
was
ill
prepared
for
a
siege
for
he
had
but
one
gun
with
him
a
which
he
had
abandoned
in
january
when
retreating
from
ponferrada
to
orense
and
which
he
now
picked
up
intact
with
its
store
of
ammunition
at
a
mountain
hermitage
where
it
had
been
safely
hidden
for
two
months
marching
on
villafranca
next
day
he
fell
upon
the
french
before
they
had
any
conception
that
there
was
a
hostile
force
in
their
neighbourhood
he
beat
them
out
of
the
town
into
the
citadel
after
a
sharp
skirmish
and
then
surrounded
them
in
their
refuge
and
began
to
batter
its
gates
with
his
single
gun
if
the
garrison
could
have
held
out
for
a
few
days
they
would
probably
have
been
relieved
for
ney
was
but
three
marches
distant
but
the
governor
regarding
the
old
castle
as
untenable
against
artillery
surrendered
at
the
first
summons
thus
la
romana
captured
a
whole
battalion
of
the
léger
strong
together
with
several
hundreds
more
of
convalescents
and
stragglers
who
had
been
halted
at
villafranca
owing
to
the
impossibility
of
sending
small
detachments
through
the
mountains
when
the
insurgents
were
abroad
the
number
of
unwounded
prisoners
was
that
of
killed
and
wounded
nearly
the
captives
were
sent
off
immediately
into
the
asturias
carrol
saw
them
arrive
at
oviedo
there
is
a
long
dispatch
of
mendizabal
to
la
romana
in
the
record
office
giving
details
of
the
storm
of
villafranca
which
was
all
over
in
four
hours
having
accomplished
this
successful
stroke
la
romana
was
desirous
of
pursuing
his
way
to
the
asturias
where
he
was
determined
to
make
his
power
felt
he
took
with
him
only
one
regiment
that
of
la
princesa
one
of
his
old
corps
from
the
baltic
and
handed
over
the
temporary
command
of
the
army
to
general
mahy
with
orders
to
hold
on
to
the
vierzo
as
long
as
possible
but
to
retire
on
the
asturias
if
ney
came
up
against
him
in
force
the
marshal
however
did
not
move
from
lugo
when
he
heard
of
the
fall
of
the
garrison
of
villafranca
he
was
already
so
much
entangled
with
the
insurrection
that
he
could
spare
no
troops
for
an
expedition
to
the
vierzo
in
order
to
reopen
the
communication
with
astorga
he
would
have
had
to
call
in
his
outlying
brigades
and
at
the
present
moment
he
was
more
concerned
about
the
fate
of
tuy
and
vigo
than
about
the
operations
of
la
romana
accordingly
mahy
was
left
unmolested
for
the
greater
part
of
a
month
in
his
cantonments
along
the
banks
of
the
sil
it
was
a
welcome
respite
for
the
army
of
galicia
captain
carrol
had
written
to
him
a
few
days
before
to
beg
him
to
hasten
to
oviedo
i
strongly
advise
your
excellency
s
repairing
to
this
city
oviedo
and
adopting
such
plans
and
measures
for
the
better
government
of
the
province
and
the
active
operations
of
the
army
as
your
excellency
shall
think
there
were
similar
appeals
from
spanish
officers
discontented
with
the
junta
romana
meanwhile
betook
himself
to
oviedo
with
his
escort
and
on
arriving
there
on
april
entered
into
a
furious
controversy
with
the
junta
finding
them
obstinate
and
not
disposed
to
carry
out
his
plans
without
discussion
he
finally
executed
a
petty
d
it
bears
an
absurd
resemblance
to
cromwell
s
famous
dissolution
of
the
long
parliament
coming
into
their
with
colonel
joseph
o
donnell
and
fifty
grenadiers
of
the
princesa
regiment
he
delivered
an
harangue
to
the
members
accusing
them
of
all
manner
of
maladministration
and
provincial
selfishness
then
he
signed
to
his
soldiers
and
bade
them
clear
the
room
it
may
be
worth
while
to
quote
the
opening
clauses
of
la
romana
s
proclamation
explaining
his
d

is
dated
the
day
after
his
purge
of

who
was

that
the

the

the
most

of

in

la

then
on
his
own
authority
nominated
a
new
junta
but
many
of
its
members
refused
to
act
doubting
the
legality
of
his
action
while
the
dispossessed
delegates
kept
up
a
paper
controversy
and
sent
reams
of
objurgatory
letters
to
the
government
at
seville
ballasteros
and
his
army
at
the
other
side
of
the
principality
seem
to
have
paid
little
attention
to
la
romana
but
the
marquis
so
far
got
his
way
that
he
began
to
send
stores
medicines
munitions
and
clothing
to
his
troops
in
the
vierzo
he
even
succeeded
in
procuring
a
few

displeasure
advanced
from
the
vierzo
towards
lugo
with
the
intention
of
beating
up
the
french

there
stationed
he
took
post
at
navia

just
outside
the
borders
of
the
asturias
and
called
to
his
standards
all
the
peasantry
of
the
surrounding
region
la

wrote
him
urgent
letters
directing
him
to
avoid
a
battle
and
to
await
his
own
return
he
should
remember
that
it
was
the
policy
of
fabius
maximus
that
saved
rome
and
curb
his
warlike
zeal
it
is
satisfactory
to
find
that
one
spanish
general
at
least
was
free
from
that
wild
desire
for
pitched
battles
that
possessed
most
of
his
contemporaries
mahy
thus
warned
halted
in
his
march
towards
lugo
and
remained
in
his
cantonments
in
the
valley
of
the
navia
his
chief
should
have
returned
to
him
but
lingered
at
oviedo
till
april
was
over
busy
in
the
work
of
reorganization
and
in
the
forwarding
of
supplies
meanwhile
the
french
hold
on
southern
galicia
had
completely
disappeared
vigo
had
fallen
in
march
tuy
had
been
evacuated
maucune
s
column
had
cut
its
way
back
to
santiago
with
some
difficulty
bringing
to
ney
the
news
of
soult
s
capture
of
oporto
but
also
the
assurance
that
the
whole
valley
of
the
minho
and
the
western
had
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
insurgents
what
the
duke
of
elchingen
s
next
move
would
have
been
if
he
had
not
received
further
intelligence
from
without
we
can
not
say
but
in
the
first
week
in
may
the
communication
with
madrid
was
at
last
reopened
and
he
was
ordered
to
take
his
part
in
a
new
and
broad
plan
of
operations
against
la
romana
s
army
and
the
asturias
ever
since
la
romana
had
stormed
villafranca
and
all
news
from
galicia
had
been
completely
cut
off
king
joseph
and
his
adviser
jourdan
had
been
in
a
state
of
great
fear
and
perplexity
as
to
the
condition
of
affairs
in
the
soult
had
long
passed
out
of
their
ken
and
now
ney
also
was
lost
to
sight
in
default
of
accurate
information
they
received
all
manner
of
lugubrious
rumours
from
leon
and
astorga
and
imagined
that
the
sixth
corps
was
in
far
more
desperate
straits
than
was
actually
the
case
fearing
the
worst
they
resolved
to
find
out
at
all
costs
what
was
going
on
in
galicia
to
do
so
it
was
necessary
to
fit
out
an
expedition
sufficiently
strong
to
brush
aside
the
insurgents
and
communicate
with
ney
troops
however
were
hard
to
find
lapisse
had
already
marched
from
salamanca
to
join
victor
in
old
castile
and
leon
there
were
but
kellermann
s
dragoons
and
a
few
garrisons
none
of
which
could
leave
their
posts
marshal
bessières
to
whom
the
general
charge
of
the
northern
provinces
had
been
given
by
the
emperor
could
show
conclusively
that
he
was
not
able
to
equip
a
column
of
even
men
for
service
in
galicia
the
only
quarter
whence
troops
could
be
procured
was
aragon
where
everything
had
remained
quiet
since
the
fall
of
saragossa
the
emperor
had
issued
orders
that
of
the
two
corps
which
had
taken
part
in
the
siege
the
third
only
should
remain
to
hold
down
the
conquered
kingdom
hence
mortier
and
the
fifth
should
have
been
disposable
to
reinforce
the
troops
in
old
castile
but
with
the
austrian
war
upon
his
hands
napoleon
was
thinking
of
withdrawing
mortier
and
his
men
from
spain
in
a
dispatch
dated
april
he
announced
that
the
marshal
was
to
retire
from
aragon
to
logroño
in
navarre
from
whence
he
might
possibly
be
recalled
to
france
if
circumstances
demanded
it
at
the
same
moment
king
joseph
was
writing
to
mortier
to
summon
him
into
old
castile
and
pointing
out
to
him
that
the
safety
of
the
whole
of
northern
spain
depended
upon
his
presence
much
perplexed
by
these
contradictory
orders
the
duke
of
treviso
took
a
and
marched
to
burgos
which
was
actually
in
old
castile
but
lay
only
three
marches
from
logroño
and
upon
the
direct
route
to
france
a
few
days
later
the
emperor
moved
by
his
brother
s
incessant
appeals
and
seeing
that
it
was
to
reopen
the
communication
between
ney
and
soult
permitted
mortier
to
march
to
valladolid
where
he
was
in
a
good
position
for
holding
down
the
entire
province
of
old
castile
he
also
gave
leave
to
the
king
to
employ
for
an
expedition
to
galicia
the
two
regiments
of
the
third
corps
which
had
escorted
the
prisoners
of
saragossa
to
bayonne
and
which
were
now
on
their
homeward
way
to
join
their
division
in
aragon
napoleon
to
joseph
from
paris
april
it
was
thus
possible
to
get
together
enough
troops
to
open
the
way
to
galicia
the
charge
of
the
expedition
was
handed
over
to
kellermann
who
was
given
his
own
dragoons
the
two
regiments
from
bayonne
a
stray
battalion
of
leval
s
germans
from
segovia
a
polish
battalion
from
buitrago
and
a
provisional
regiment
organized
from
belated
details
of
the
second
and
sixth
corps
which
had
been
lying
in
various
garrisons
of
castile
and
leon
he
had
altogether
some
or
men
whom
he
concentrated
at
astorga
on
april
marching
on
villafranca
he
met
no
regular
opposition
but
was
harassed
by
the
way
by
the
peasantry
who
had
abandoned
their
villages
and
retired
into
the
hills
mahy
had
moved
off
the
main
road
by
making
his
advance
to
navia
de
suarna
and
was
not
sighted
by
kellermann
nor
did
the
spaniard
think
fit
to
meddle
with
such
a
powerful
force
as
that
which
was
now
passing
him
for
details
concerning
the
composition
of
this
expedition
see

s
on
may
the
column
reached
lugo
where
it
fell
in
with
maurice
mathieu
s
division
of
the
sixth
corps
and
obtained
full
information
as
to
ney
s
position
the
marshal
was
absent
at
corunna
but
sent
his
chief
of
the
staff
to
meet
kellermann
and
concert
with
him
a
common
plan
of
operations
it
was
settled
that
they
should
concentrate
their
attention
on
la
romana
and
the
asturians
leaving
southern
galicia
alone
for
the
present
and
taking
no
heed
of
soult
of
whom
they
had
received
no
news
for
a
full
month
for
the
destruction
of
the
spanish
armies
of
the
north
a
concentric
movement
was
planned
ney
undertook
to
concentrate
the
main
body
of
his
corps
at
lugo
and
to
fall
on
the
asturians
from
the
west
crushing
mahy
on
the
way
he
stipulated
however
that
he
should
be
allowed
to
return
to
galicia
as
quickly
as
possible
lest
the
insurgents
should
make
havoc
of
his
garrisons
during
his
absence
kellermann
was
to
retrace
his
steps
to
astorga
and
leon
and
from
thence
to
march
on
the
asturias
by
the
pass
of
pajares
its
great
southern
outlet
at
the
same
moment
bonnet
at
santander
was
to
be
requested
to
fall
on
from
the
east
and
to
attack
ballasteros
and
the
division
that
lay
behind
the
deba
when
it
was
reported
to
mahy
and
la
romana
that
kellermann
had
turned
back
from
lugo
and
was
retreating
upon
astorga
they
failed
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
his
movement
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
his
expedition
had
been
sent
out
with
no
purpose
save
that
of
communicating
with
ney
unconscious
that
a
simultaneous
attack
from
all
sides
was
being
prepared
against
them
they
failed
to
concentrate
by
leaving
small
containing
detachments
at
the
outlying
posts
they
could
have
massed
men
against
any
one
of
the
french
columns
but
they
failed
to
see
their
opportunity
and
were
caught
in
a
state

opposite

worster
at

did
not
unite
with
mahy
s
army
at
navia
de
suarna
and
la
romana
remained
at
oviedo
with
two
regiments
only
hence
came
hopeless
disaster
when
the
french
attack
was
at
last
let
loose
upon
the
asturias
on
may
the
duke
of
elchingen
drew
together
at
lugo
four
of
the
eight
infantry
regiments
which
formed
the
sixth
corps
with
two
of
his
four
cavalry
regiments
and
eight
carried
by
mules
this
formed
a
compact
force
of
bayonets
and
sabres
he
left
behind
him
four
battalions
and
a
cavalry
regiment
under
maucune
at
santiago
the
same
force
under
the
cavalry
brigadier
fournier
at
lugo
two
battalions
at
corunna
one
at
betanzos
and
one
at
ferrol
the
force
that
marched
on
the
asturias
was
composed
of
the
léger
and
of
maurice
mathieu
s
division
the
from
marchand
s
the
hussars
and
dragoons
maucune

detachment
consisted
of
two
battalions
each
of
the
léger
and
the
with
the
chasseurs
and
one
battery
fournier
s
detachment
was
composed
of
the
dragoons
two
battalions
of
the
and
one
of
the
the
obvious
route
by
which
the
marshal
might
have
advanced
on
oviedo
was
the
by
mondonedo
and
castropol
which
worster
was
guarding
but
in
order
to
save
time
and
to
fall
upon
the
enemy
on
an
unexpected
line
he
took
a
shorter
but
more
rugged
mountain
road
by
meyra
and
ibias
which
led
him
into
the
valley
of
the
navia
this
brought
him
straight
upon
mahy
s
army
but
that
general
when
he
learnt
of
the
strength
that
was
directed
against
him
retreated
in
haste
after
a
skirmish
at
pequin
and
fled
not
to
the
asturias
but
westward
into
the
upper
valley
of
the
minho
may
this
move
was
vexatious
to
ney
who
would
have
preferred
to
drive
him
on
to
oviedo
to
share
in
the
general
rout
that
was
being
prepared
for
the
asturians
the
marshal
refused
to
follow
him
and
pushed
on
to
cangas
de
tineo
in
the
valley
of
the
narcea
capturing
there
a
large
convoy
of
food
and
ammunition
which
was
on
its
way
from
la
romana
to
mahy
on
may
he
hurried
on
to
salas
on
the
he
was
at
the
bridge
of
gallegos
on
the
nora
river
only
ten
miles
from
oviedo
here
for
the
first
time
he
met
with
serious
opposition
hitherto
he
had
suffered
from
nothing
but
casual
sniping
on
the
part
of
the
peasantry
his
march
had
been
so
rapid
that
la
romana
had
only
heard
of
his
approach
on
the
seventeenth
and
had
not
been
able
to
call
in
any
of
his
outlying
detachments
the
marquis
was
forced
to
attempt
to
defend
the
passage
of
the
nora
with
nothing
more
than
his
small
central
reserve
the
one
galician
regiment
la
princesa
only
bayonets
that
he
had
brought
with
him
from
villafranca
and
one
asturian
battalion
not
more
than
men
naturally
he
was
routed
with
great
loss
though
ney
allows
that
the
princesa
regiment
made
a
creditable
defence
at
the
bridge
the
spanish
troops
therefore
dispersed
and
fled
eastward
while
romana
rode
down
to
the
seaport
of
gijon
and
took
ship
on
a
spanish
sloop
of
war
along
with
the
members
of
his
junta
the
marshal
seized
oviedo
on
the
nineteenth
the
place
was
pillaged
in
the
most
thorough
fashion
by
his
troops
in
his
dispatch
he
makes
the
excuse
that
a
few
peasants
had
attempted
to
defend
some
barricades
in
the
suburbs
and
that
they
not
the
soldiery
had
begun
the
sack
judaeus
apella
the
ways
of
the
bands
of
napoleon
are
too
well
known
and
we
shall
not
believe
that
it
was
spaniards
who
stole
the
cathedral
plate
or
tore
the
bones
of
the
early
kings
of
asturias
from
their
in
search
of
treasure
on
may
ney
marched
with
one
regiment
down
to
gijon
where
he
found
lbs
of
powder
newly
landed
from
england
and
a
quantity
of
military
stores
an
english
merchantman
was
captured
and
another
burnt
a
detached
column
occupied
aviles
the
second
seaport
of
the
asturias
carrol
gives
an
excellent
account
of
the
french
invasion
in
a
long
dispatch
written
from
vigo
on
june
he
says
that
the
marquis
only
heard
of
ney
s
approach
by
the
peasants
flying
from
cangas
de
tineo
on
the
morning
of
may
he
himself
was
sent
out
to
verify
the
incredible
information
and
came
on
the
french
as
they
were
crossing
the
navia
only
thirty
miles
from
oviedo
he
rode
back
in
haste
and
met
one
asturian
battalion
coming
up
and
afterwards
the
regiment
of
la
princesa
romana
had
no
other
troops
and
only
a
few
hundred
peasantry
joined
in
the
defence
of
the
bridge
of
gallegos
ce

captured

and
escaped
in
an
open
boat
on
the
following
day
may
a
detachment
sent
inland
from
oviedo
up
the
valley
of
the
lena
with
orders
to
search
for
the
column
coming
from
the
south
got
into
touch
with
that
force
kellermann
had
duly
reached
leon
where
he
found
orders
directing
him
to
send
back
to
aragon
the
two
regiments
of
the
third
corps
which
had
been
lent
him
and
to
take
instead
a
division
of
mortier
s
corps
which
was
now
disposable
for
service
in
the
north
accordingly
he
picked
up
girard
s
late
suchet
s
division
and
leaving
one
of
its
brigades
at
leon
marched
with
the
other
and
the
remainder
of
his
original
force
to
storm
the
defiles
of
pajares
he
had
with
him
between
and
troops
a
force
with
which
he
easily
routed
the
asturian
brigade
of
men
under
colonel
quixano
which
had
been
set
to
guard
the
pass
at
the
end
of
two
days
of
irregular
fighting
kellermann
descended
into
the
valley
of
the
lena
and
met
ney
s
outposts
on
may
the
routed
enemy
dispersed
among
the
hills
the
and
of
morlot
s
division
it
remains
to
speak
of
the
third
french
column
which
started
to
invade
the
asturias
that
of
bonnet
this
general
marched
from
santander
on
may
with
men
intending
to
attack
ballasteros
and
force
his
way
to
oviedo
by
the
that
passes
by
san
vincente
de
la
barquera
and
villaviciosa
but
he
found
no
one
to
fight
for
ballasteros
had
been
summoned
by
la
romana
to
defend
oviedo
and
had
started
off
by
the
inland
road
viâ
cangas
de
oñis
and
infiesto
the
two
armies
therefore
were
marching
parallel
to
each
other
with
rough
mountains
between
them
on
reaching
infiesto
on
may
ballasteros
heard
of
the
fall
of
oviedo
and
of
the
forcing
of
the
pass
of
pajares
seeing
that
it
would
be
useless
to
run
into
the
lion
s
mouth
by
proceeding
any
further
he
fell
back
into
the
mountains
and
took
refuge
in
the
upland
valley
of
covadonga
the
site
of
king
pelayo
s
famous
victory
over
the
moors
in
the
year
here
he
remained
undiscovered
and
was
gradually
joined
by
the
wrecks
of
the
force
which
ney
had
routed
at
oviedo
including
o
donnell
and
the
princesa
regiment
bonnet
passed
him
without
discovering
his
whereabouts
advanced
as
far
as
infiesto
and
villaviciosa
and
got
into
touch
with
kellermann
thus
the
three
french
columns
had
all
won
their
way
into
the
heart
of
the
asturias
but
though
they
had
seized
its
capital
and
its
seaports
they
had
failed
to
catch
its
army
and
only
half
their
task
had
been
performed
of
all
the
asturian
troops
only
the
two
small
forces
at
oviedo
and
pajares
had
been
met
and
routed
worster
had
not
been
molested
mahy
had
doubled
back
into
galicia
ballasteros
had
gone
up
into
the
mountains
if
the
invasion
was
to
have
any
definite
results
it
was
necessary
to
hunt
down
all
these
three
divisions
but
there
was
no
time
to
do
so
ney
was
anxious
about
his
galician
garrisons
bonnet
remembered
that
he
had
left
santander
in
charge
of
a
weak
detachment
of
no
more
than
men
both
refused
to
remain
in
the
asturias
or
to
engage
in
a
long
stern
chase
after
the
elusive
spaniards
among
the
peaks
of
the
peñas
de
europa
and
the
sierras
albas
they
decided
that
kellermann
with
his
men
must
finish
the
business
accordingly
they
departed
each
to
his
own
province
and
it
was
high
time
for
their
worst
expectations
had
been
fulfilled
mahy
in
the
west
and
ballasteros
in
the
east
had
each
played
the
correct
game
and
had
fallen
upon
the
small
garrisons
left
exposed
in
their
rear
moreover
the
insurgents
of
southern
galicia
had
crossed
the
ulla
and
marched
on
santiago
if
ney
had
remained
ten
days
longer
in
the
asturias
it
is
probable
that
he
would
have
returned
to
find
the
half
of
the
sixth
corps
which
he
had
left
in
galicia
absolutely
exterminated
the
marshal
however
was
just
in
time
to
prevent
this
disaster
handing
over
the
charge
of
the
principality
to
kellermann
he
marched
off
on
may
by
the
which
leads
to
galicia
by
the
route
of
navia
castropol
and
ribadeo
he
hoped
to
deal
with
worster
by
the
way
having
learnt
that
the
swiss
general
had
advanced
from
castropol
by
la
romana
s
orders
and
was
moving
cautiously
in
the
direction
of
oviedo
but
worster
was
fortunate
enough
to
escape
he
went
up
into
the
mountains
when
he
heard
that
ney
was
near
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
learning
that
the
marshal
had
passed
him
by
the
rivers
being
in
flood
and
the
bridges
broken
the
french
had
a
slow
and
tiresome
march
to
ribadeo
which
they
only
reached
on
may
next
day
the
duke
of
elchingen
was
at
castropol
where
he
received
the
news
that
lugo
had
been
in
the
gravest
peril
and
had
only
been
relieved
by
the
unexpected
appearance
of
soult
and
the
second
corps
from
the
direction
of
orense
the
sequence
of
events
during
the
marshal
s
absence
had
been
as
follows
when
mahy
found
that
he
had
escaped
pursuit
he
had
immediately
made
up
his
mind
to
strike
at
the
french
garrisons
he
tried
to
persuade
worster
to
join
him
or
to
attack
ferrol
but
could
not
induce
him
to
quit
the
asturias
so
with
his
own
men
mahy
marched
on
lugo
beat
general
fournier
who
came
out
to
meet
him
in
a
skirmish
outside
the
walls
and
drove
him
into
the
town
lugo
had
no
fortification
save
a
mediaeval
wall
and
the
spaniards
were
in
great
hopes
of
storming
it
as
they
had
stormed
villafranca
but
when
they
had
lain
two
days
before
the
place
they
were
surprised
to
hear
that
a
large
french
force
was
marching
against
them
it
was
not
ney
returning
from
the
asturias
but
the
dilapidated
corps
of
soult
retreating
from
orense
wisely
refusing
to
face
an
army
of
men
mahy
raised
the
siege
and
retired
to
villalba
in
the
folds
of
the
sierra
de
loba
on
may
soult
entered
lugo
where
he
was
at
last
able
to
give
his
men
nine
days
rest
and
could
begin
to
cast
about
him
for
means
to
refit
them
with
the
proper
equipment
of
an
army
for
as
we
have
seen
they
were
in
a
condition
of
absolute
destitution
and
wholly
unable
to
take
the
field
at
castropol
ney
heard
at
one
and
the
same
moment
that
lugo
had
been
in
danger
and
that
it
had
been
relieved
but
he
also
received
news
of
even
greater
importance
from
another
quarter
maucune
and
the
detachment
which
he
had
left
at
santiago
had
been
defeated
in
the
open
field
by
the
insurgents
of
southern
galicia
and
had
been
compelled
to
fall
back
on
corunna
this
was
now
the
point
of
danger
wherefore
the
marshal
neither
moved
to
join
soult
at
lugo
nor
set
himself
to
hunt
mahy
in
the
mountains
but
marched
straight
for
corunna
to
succour
maucune
the
force
which
had
defeated
that
general
consisted
in
the
main
of
the
insurgents
who
had
beleaguered
tuy
and
vigo
in
march
and
april
they
were
now
under
morillo
and
garcia
del
barrio
who
were
beginning
to
reduce
them
to
some
sort
of
discipline
and
were
organizing
them
into
battalions
and
companies
but
the
core
of
the
division
of
the
minho
as
this
force
was
now
called
was
composed
of
the
small
body
of
regulars
which
la
romana
had
left
at
puebla
de
senabria
under
martin
la
carrera
that
officer
after
giving
his
feeble
detachment
some
weeks
of
rest
had
marched
via
monterey
and
orense
to
join
the
insurrectionary
army
he
brought
with
him
nine
guns
and
men
on
may
carrera
and
morillo
crossed
the
ulla
and
advanced
on
santiago
with
men
of
whom
only
possessed
firearms
maucune
came
forth
to
meet
them
in
the
campo
de
estrella
outside
the
city
with
his
four
battalions
and
a
regiment
of
chasseurs
thinking
to
gain
an
easy
success
when
the
enemy
offered
him
battle
in
the
open
but
he
was
outnumbered
by
three
to
one
and
as
the
galicians
showed
much
spirit
and
stood
steadily
to
their
guns
he
was
repulsed
with
loss
carrera
then
attacked
in
his
turn
drove
the
french
into
santiago
chased
them
through
the
town
and
pursued
them
for
a
league
beyond
it
maucune
was
wounded
and
lost
men
a
fifth
of
his
whole
force
and
two
guns
he
fell
back
in
disorder
on
corunna
he
had
the
audacity
to
write
to
ney
that
he
had
retired
after
an
indecisive
combat
but
the
marshal
reading
between
the
lines
of
his
dispatch
hastened
to
corunna
with
all
the
troops
which
had
returned
from
the
asturias
and
did
not
consider
the
situation
secure
till
he
learnt
that
carrera
had
not
advanced
from
santiago
the
plain
from
which
santiago
gets
its
name
of
santiago
de
compostella
leaving
his
main
body
opposite
the
division
of
the
minho
the
duke
of
elchingen
now
betook
himself
to
lugo
to
concert
a
joint
plan
of
operation
with
soult
may
the
results
of
their
somewhat
stormy
conference
must
be
told
in
another
chapter
meanwhile
the
situation
behind
them
was
rapidly
changing
on
may
la
romana
who
had
landed
at
ribadeo
rejoined
mahy
and
his
army
at
villalba
the
marquis
on
surveying
the
situation
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
too
dangerous
to
remain
in
the
northern
angle
of
galicia
between
the
french
army
at
lugo
and
the
sea
he
resolved
to
return
to
the
southern
region
of
the
province
and
to
get
into
touch
with
carrera
and
the
troops
on
the
minho
he
therefore
bade
his
army
prepare
for
another
forced
march
across
the
mountains
they
murmured
but
obeyed
and
cautiously
slipping
past
soult
s
corps
by
a
flank
movement
crossed
the
to
villafranca
and
reached
monforte
de
lemos
from
thence
they
safely
descended
to
orense
where
la
romana
established
his
head
quarters
june
thus
the
spaniards
were
once
more
in
line
and
prepared
to
defend
the
whole
of
southern
galicia
we
have
still
to
deal
with
the
state
of
affairs
in
the
asturias
after
ney
s
departure
on
may
kellermann
lay
at
oviedo
and
bonnet
at
infiesto
but
a
few
days
later
the
latter
general
received
the
disquieting
news
that
ballasteros
whose
movements
had
hitherto
escaped
him
was
on
the
move
towards
the
east
and
might
be
intending
either
to
make
a
raid
into
the
plains
of
castile
or
to
descend
on
santander
and
its
weak
garrison
ballasteros
as
a
matter
of
fact
had
resolved
to
stir
up
trouble
in
bonnet
s
rear
with
the
object
of
drawing
him
off
from
the
asturias
leaving
his
refuge
at
covadonga
on
may
he
marched
by
unmarked
on
any
map
to
potes
in
the
upper
valley
of
the
deba
there
he
remained
a
few
days
and
finding
that
he
was
unpursued
and
that
his
exact
situation
was
unknown
to
the
french
resolved
to
make
a
dash
for
santander
starting
on
june
and
keeping
to
the
mountains
he
successfully
achieved
his
end
and
arrived
at
his
goal
before
the
garrison
of
that
place
had
any
knowledge
of
his
approach
on
the
morning
of
june
he
stormed
the
city
driving
out
general
noirot
who
escaped
with
men
but
capturing
of
the
garrison
and
sick
in
hospital
as
well
as
the
whole
of
the
stores
and
munitions
of
bonnet
s
regiments
among
his
other
prizes
was
the
sum
of
in
cash
in
the
military
chest
of
the
division
some
of
the
french
tried
to
escape
by
sea
in
three
corvettes
and
two
luggers
which
lay
in
the
harbour
but
the
british
frigates
and
which
lay
off
the
coast
captured
them
all
this
was
a
splendid
stroke
and
if
ballasteros
had
been
prudent
he
might
have
got
away
unharmed
with
all
his
plunder
but
he
lingered
in
santander
though
he
knew
that
bonnet
must
be
in
pursuit
of
him
and
resolved
to
defend
the
town
the
french
general
had
started
to
protect
his
base
and
his
dépôts
the
moment
that
he
ascertained
the
real
direction
of
ballasteros
march
on
the
night
of
june
he
met
the
fugitive
garrison
and
learnt
that
santander
had
fallen
late
on
the
ensuing
day
he
reached
its
suburbs
and
sent
in
two
battalions
to
make
a
dash
at
the
place
they
were
beaten
off
but
next
morning
bonnet
attacked
with
his
whole
force
the
asturians
were
defeated
and
ballasteros
raid
ended
in
a
disaster
he
himself
escaped
by
sea
but
of
his
men
were
captured
and
the
rest
dispersed
the
french
recovered
their
sick
and
prisoners
and
such
of
their
stores
as
the
spaniards
had
not
consumed
the
wrecks
of
ballasteros
division
drifted
back
over
the
hills
to
their
native
principality
save
one
detachment
the
regulars
of
la
romana
s
old
regiment
of
la
princesa
this
small
body
of
men
turned
south
and
by
an
astounding
march
across
old
castile
and
aragon
reached
molina
on
the
borders
of
valencia
where
they
joined
the
army
of
blake
they
had
gone
miles
through
territory
of
which
the
french
were
supposed
to
be
in
military
possession
but
threaded
their
way
between
the
garrisons
in
perfect
safety
because
the
peasantry
never
betrayed
their
position
to
the
enemy
all
this
may
be
studied
in
two
dispatches
of
bonnet
to
king
joseph
dated
santander
june
and
june
disastrous
as
was
its
end
ballasteros
expedition
had
yet
served
its
purpose
not
only
had
it
thrown
the
whole
of
the
french
garrisons
in
biscay
and
guipuzcoa
into
confusion
but
even
the
governor
of
bayonne
had
been
frightened
and
had
sent
alarming
dispatches
to
the
emperor
this
was
comparatively
unimportant
but
it
was
a
very
different
matter
that
bonnet
had
been
forced
to
evacuate
the
asturias
all
of
whose
eastern
region
was
now
free
from
the
invaders
more
was
to
follow
kellermann
still
lay
at
oviedo
worried
but
not
seriously
incommoded
by
worster
and
the
asturians
of
the
west
but
a
few
days
after
bonnet
s
departure
he
received
a
request
from
mortier
backed
by
orders
from
king
joseph
that
the
division
of
the
corps
which
had
been
lent
him
should
instantly
return
to
castile
this
was
one
of
the
results
of
wellesley
s
campaign
on
the
douro
for
mortier
hearing
of
soult
s
expulsion
from
northern
portugal
imagined
that
the
british
army
being
now
free
for
further
action
would
debouch
by
almeida
and
ciudad
rodrigo
and
fall
upon
salamanca
he
needed
the
aid
of
his
second
division
which
kellermann
was
forced
to
send
back
but
it
would
have
been
not
only
useless
but
extremely
dangerous
to
linger
at
oviedo
with
the
small
remnant
of
the
expeditionary
force
when
girard
s
regiments
had
been
withdrawn
therefore
kellermann
wisely
resolved
to
evacuate
the
whole
principality
and
returned
to
leon
by
the
pass
of
pajares
in
the
third
week
of
june
thus
ended
in
complete
failure
the
great
concentric
attack
on
the
asturias
the
causes
of
the
fiasco
were
two
the
french
generals
chose
as
their
objective
not
the
enemy
s
armies
but
his
capital
and
base
of
operations
both
ney
and
bonnet
while
marching
on
oviedo
left
what
adapting
a
naval
phrase
we
may
call
an
behind
them
and
in
each
case
that
army
fell
upon
the
detachments
left
in
the
rear
and
pressed
them
so
hard
that
the
invading
forces
could
not
stay
in
the
asturias
but
were
forced
to
turn
back
to
protect
their
communications
in
spain
conquest
was
useless
unless
a
garrison
could
be
left
behind
to
hold
down
the
territory
that
was
overrun
but
neither
ney
kellermann
nor
bonnet
had
any
troops
to
devote
to
such
a
purpose
they
invaded
the
asturias
with
regiments
borrowed
from
other
regions
from
which
they
could
not
long
be
spared
as
later
experience
in
and
showed
it
required
some
men
merely
to
maintain
a
hold
upon
oviedo
and
the
central
parts
of
the
principality
the
invaders
had
no
such
force
at
their
disposition
the
troops
from
the
corps
were
wanted
in
galicia
those
of
the
corps
in
castile
those
of
bonnet
in
the
montaña
if
it
were
impossible
to
garrison
the
asturias
the
invasion
dwindled
down
into
a
raid
and
a
raid
which
left
untouched
the
larger
part
of
the
enemy
s
field
army
was
useless
it
would
have
been
better
policy
to
hunt
mahy
worster
and
ballasteros
rather
than
to
secure
for
a
bare
three
weeks
military
possession
of
oviedo
and
gijon
if
soult
had
not
dropped
from
the
clouds
as
it
were
to
save
lugo
if
ballasteros
had
been
a
little
more
prudent
at
santander
the
asturian
expedition
would
have
ended
not
merely
in
a
failure
but
in
an
ignominious
defeat
it
should
never
have
been
undertaken
while
the
galician
insurrection
was
still
raging
and
while
no
troops
were
available
for
the
permanent
garrisoning
of
the
principality
searching
a
little
deeper
may
we
not
say
that
the
ultimate
cause
of
the
fiasco
was
napoleon
s
misconception
of
the
character
of
the
spanish
war
it
was
he
who
ordered
the
invasion
of
the
asturias
and
he
issued
his
orders
under
the
hypothesis
that
it
could
be
not
only
conquered
but
retained
but
with
the
numbers
then
at
the
disposal
of
his
generals
this
was
impossible
because
the
insurrection
absorbed
so
many
of
their
troops
that
no
more
could
be
detached
without
risking
the
loss
of
all
that
had
been
already
gained
by
grasping
at
the
asturias
napoleon
nearly
lost
galicia
only
soult
s
appearance
prevented
that
province
from
falling
completely
into
the
hands
of
mahy
and
la
carrera
and
that
appearance
was
as
involuntary
as
it
was
unexpected
if
the
duke
of
dalmatia
had
been
able
to
carry
out
his
original
design
he
would
have
retreated
from
oporto
to
zamora
and
not
to
orense
if
beresford
had
not
foiled
him
at
amarante
he
would
have
been
resting
on
the
douro
when
fournier
was
in
such
desperate
straits
at
lugo
in
that
case
ney
might
have
returned
from
oviedo
to
find
that
his
detachments
had
been
destroyed
and
that
galicia
was
lost
it
was
not
the
emperor
s
fault
that
this
disaster
failed
to
occur
section
xv
chapter
ii
the
french
abandon
galicia
when
upon
may
ney
arrived
at
lugo
and
met
soult
in
conference
it
seemed
that
now
or
never
the
time
had
come
when
a
serious
endeavour
might
be
made
to
subdue
the
galician
insurgents
the
whole
force
of
the
and
corps
was
concentrated
in
the
narrow
triangle
between
ferrol
corunna
and
lugo
the
two
marshals
had
still
men
fit
for
service
after
deducting
the
sick
if
they
set
aside
competent
garrisons
for
the
three
towns
that
we
have
just
named
they
could
still
show
some
men
available
for
field
operations
and
with
such
a
force
ney
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
insurrection
might
be
beaten
down
it
was
true
that
the
corps
was
in
a
deplorable
condition
as
regards
equipment
but
on
the
other
hand
corunna
and
ferrol
were
still
full
of
the
stores
of
arms
and
ammunition
that
had
been
captured
when
they
surrendered
clothing
no
doubt
was
lamentably
deficient
and
ney
could
only
supply
hundreds
where
soult
asked
for
thousands
of
boots
and
but
he
refitted
his
colleague
s
troops
with
muskets
and
ammunition
and
furnished
him
with
eight
the
duke
of
dalmatia
would
not
take
though
a
certain
number
were
offered
him
for
after
his
experience
of
the
way
that
his
artillery
had
delayed
him
in
february
and
march
he
refused
to
accept
them
horses
and
mules
were
unattainable
nearly
half
soult
s
cavalry
was
dismounted
and
he
had
lost
most
of
his
between
guimaraens
and
montalegre
nevertheless
the
corps
after
a
week
s
rest
at
lugo
was
once
more
capable
of
service
its
weakly
men
had
been
left
in
hospital
at
oporto
or
had
fallen
by
the
way
in
the
dreadful
defiles
of
ruivaens
and
salamonde
all
that
remained
were
veterans
and
soult
out
of
his
men
had
no
more
than
sick
and
wounded
he
resolved
to
disembarrass
himself
of
another
hindrance
his
dismounted
cavalry
and
in
each
regiment
made
the
and
squadrons
hand
over
their
chargers
to
the
and
the
troopers
thus
left
without
mounts
were
armed
with
muskets
and
formed
into
a
column
to
which
were
added
the
of
certain
infantry
battalions
belonging
to
the
regiments
which
had
suffered
most
in
these
the
or
the
and
battalions
turned
over
their
effective
rank
and
file
to
the
others
while
the
officers
and
officers
were
to
be
sent
home
to
their
dépôts
to
organize
new
units
the
whole
body
was
placed
under
general
quesnel
who
was
directed
to
cut
his
way
to
astorga
by
the
great
it
was
hoped
that
he
would
come
safely
through
now
that
la
romana
had
withdrawn
his
army
to
southern
galicia
the
expedient
was
a
hazardous
one
but
the
column
was
fortunate
it
was
forced
to
fight
with
a
large
assembly
of
peasants
at
doncos
between
lugo
and
villafranca
but
reached
its
goal
with
no
great
loss
though
for
every
mile
of
the
march
it
was
being
sniped
and
harassed
by
the
guerrillas
soult
s
available
force
after
he
had
sent
his
sick
into
the
hospitals
of
lugo
and
had
dismissed
quesnel
s
detachment
was
about
or
sabres
and
bayonets
ney
had
about
men
left
the
two
marshals
were
bound
both
by
the
emperor
s
orders
and
by
the
mere
necessities
of
the
situation
to
with
each
other
but
there
was
a
fundamental
divergence
between
their
aims
and
intentions
ney
had
been
given
charge
of
galicia
and
he
regarded
it
as
his
duty
to
conquer
and
hold
down
the
province
he
refused
to
look
beyond
his
orders
or
to
take
into
consideration
the
progress
of
operations
in
other
parts
of
the
peninsula
soult
on
the
other
hand
always
loved
to
play
his
own
game
and
had
no
desire
to
stay
in
galicia
in
order
to
lighten
his
colleague
s
task
he
was
disgusted
with
the
land
its
mountains
and
its
insurgents
and
was
eager
to
find
some
excuse
for
quitting
it
he
had
no
difficulty
in
discovering
many
excellent
reasons
for
retiring
into
the
plains
of
leon
the
first
was
the
dilapidated
state
of
his
troops
in
spite
of
the
resources
which
ney
had
lent
the
corps
still
lacked
clothing
pay
and
transport
soult
had
written
to
king
joseph
on
may
to
ask
that
all
these
necessaries
might
be
sent
forward
to
zamora
where
he
intended
to
pick
them
up
a
still
more
plausible
plea
might
be
found
in
the
general
state
of
affairs
in
northern
spain
the
emperor
s
main
object
was
the
expulsion
of
the
british
army
from
the
peninsula
but
if
the
corps
joined
the
in
a
long
and
probably
fruitless
hunt
after
the
evasive
la
romana
wellesley
would
be
left
free
to
march
whithersoever
he
might
please
he
might
base
himself
on
almeida
and
ciudad
rodrigo
and
make
a
sudden
inroad
into
leon
and
old
castile
where
the
small
corps
of
mortier
would
certainly
prove
inadequate
to
hold
him
back
or
he
might
go
off
to
the
south
and
fall
upon
victor
in
estremadura
a
move
which
might
very
probably
lead
to
the
loss
of
madrid
soult
therefore
was
of
opinion
that
his
duty
was
to
drop
down
into
leon
and
there
join
with
mortier
in
making
such
a
demonstration
against
portugal
as
would
compel
the
british
army
to
stand
upon
the
defensive
and
to
abandon
any
idea
of
invading
spain
either
by
the
valley
of
the
douro
or
that
of
the
tagus
he
could
not
keep
his
eye
off
portugal
as
jourdan
and
king
joseph
no
less
than
ney
kept
complaining
there
can
not
be
the
least
doubt
that
soult
was
quite
right
in
turning
his
main
attention
in
this
direction
it
was
the
english
army
that
was
the
most
dangerous
enemy
and
it
was
the
flanking
position
of
portugal
that
rendered
the
french
movements
toward
the
south
of
spain
hazardous
or
impracticable
the
phrase
occurs
in
a
dispatch
of
jourdan
s
written
in
august
nevertheless
all
the
duke
of
dalmatia
s
arguments
seemed
to
his
colleague
mere
excuses
destined
to
cover
a
selfish
determination
to
abandon
the
corps
and
to
shirk
the
duty
of
in
the
conquest
of
galicia
he
insisted
that
soult
must
aid
him
in
crushing
la
romana
before
taking
any
other
task
in
hand
and
he
had
a
strong
moral
claim
for
pressing
his
request
because
it
was
from
the
resources
which
he
had
furnished
that
the
corps
had
been
and
rendered
capable
of
renewed
service
in
the
field
the
marshals
wrangled
and
their
followers
copied
them
for
a
fierce
feud
leading
to
a
copious
exchange
of
recrimination
and
many
duels
sprang
up
during
the
few
days
that
the
staffs
of
the
two
corps
lay
together
at
lugo
at
last
soult
yielded
or
feigned
to
yield
to
ney
s
instances
he
promised
to
lend
his
aid
for
the
suppression
of
the
galician
insurrection
under
certain
conditions
a
plan
for
combined
action
was
accordingly
drawn
up
there
is
clear
evidence
of
this
quarrel
in
the
diaries
and
memoirs
of
the
officers
of
both

tale
was
told
to
captain
boothby
see
his
ii
by
a
french
officer
who
said
that
he
had
been
an
of
the
scene
according
to
this
scheme
ney
was
to
advance
from
corunna
to
santiago
with
the
corps
and
was
to
drive
the
main
body
of
the
insurgents
southward
in
the
direction
of
vigo
and
tuy
following
the
line
of
the
great
soult
meanwhile
was
to
operate
in
the
inland
against
the
enemy
s
exposed
flank
he
was
to
march
from
lugo
down
the
valley
of
the
upper
minho
pushing
before
him
all
that
stood
in
his
way
with
the
object
of
thrusting
the
enemy
on
to
orense
and
then
towards
the
sea
if
all
went
right
la
romana
s
army
as
well
as
the
insurgents
of
the
coast
would
finally
be
enclosed
between
the
two
marshals
and
the
atlantic
cliffs
and
as
it
was
hoped
would
be
exterminated
or
forced
to
surrender
the
obviously
weak
point
of
the
plan
was
that
it
did
not
allow
sufficiently
for
the
power
which
the
enemy
possessed
of
escaping
by
dispersion
or
by
taking
to
the
mountains
even
if
the
details
of
the
two
movements
had
been
carried
out
with
perfect
accuracy
it
is
probable
that
the
galicians
would
have
crept
out
of
some
gap
or
slipped
away
between
the
converging
corps
or
saved
themselves
by
a
headlong
retreat
into
portugal
the
marshals
might
have
captured
vigo
and
orense
it
is
extremely
unlikely
that
they
could
have
done
more
especially
as
they
had
to
deal
with
a
general
like
la
romana
who
had
made
up
his
mind
that
his
duty
was
to
avoid
pitched
battles
and
to
preserve
his
army
at
all
costs
if
cuesta
or
blake
had
been
in
command
the
scheme
would
have
been
much
more
feasible
but
la
romana
was
the
only
spanish
commander
then
in
the
field
who
had
resolved
never
to
fight
if
he
could
help
it
on
june
ney
and
soult
parted
starting
the
one
upon
the
road
to
corunna
the
other
upon
that
which
makes
for
orense
by
the
valley
of
the
upper
minho
it
would
seem
that
neither
of
them
had
any
great
confidence
in
the
success
of
the
plan
adopted
and
that
each
was
possessed
by
the
strongest
doubts
as
to
the
loyalty
with
which
his
colleague
would
support
him
soult
was
on
the
watch
for
any
good
excuse
for
throwing
up
the
scheme
and
retiring
to
zamora
ney
was
determined
not
to
risk
himself
and
his
corps
overmuch
lest
he
should
find
himself
left
in
the
lurch
by
soult
at
the
critical
moment

this
represents
the
view
of
soult
s
staff
meanwhile
the
spaniards
had
been
straining
every
nerve
to
reorganize
the
army
of
galicia
employing
the
short
time
of
respite
that
they
had
gained
in
drafting
back
into
the
old
corps
the
numerous
stragglers
who
began
to
return
to
their
colours
as
the
summer
drew
on
and
in
raising
new
battalions
of
volunteers
la
romana
lay
in
person
at
orense
with
the
main
body
of
the
original
army
which
had
now
risen
to
a
force
of
about
properly
equipped
men
and
nearly
unarmed
recruits
he
had
still
only
four
guns
the
division
of
the
minho
was
no
longer
under
carrera
and
morillo
they
had
been
superseded
by
the
arrival
of
the
conde
de
noroña
to
whom
the
central
junta
had
given
over
the
command
this
officer
found
himself
at
the
head
of
about
men
of
whom
only
about
were
regulars
the
rest
were
peasantry
new
to
the
career
of
arms
but
so
much
exhilarated
by
their
late
successes
at
vigo
and
the
campo
de
estrella
that
it
was
hard
to
hold
them
back
from
taking
the
offensive
fortunately
noroña
was
gifted
not
only
with
tact
but
with
caution
he
knew
how
to
keep
the
horde
together
without
allowing
them
to
get
out
of
hand
and
utterly
refused
to
risk
them

the
open

on
june

arrived
before
santiago
with
the
main
body
of
the
corps
eighteen
battalions
three
cavalry
regiments
and
two
batteries
he
had
again
left
corunna
ferrol
and
lugo
in
the
charge
of
very
small
garrisons
and
was
by
no
means
without
misgivings
as
to
their
fate
during
his
absence
but
he
thought
that
his
first
duty
was
to
concentrate
a
field
force
sufficiently
large
to
face
and
beat
the
whole
army
of
galicia
in
case
la
romana
should
join
noroña
for
a
combined
attack
on
the
corps
on
the
news
of
the
marshal
s
approach
the
spanish
general
drew
back
all
his
forces
behind
the
estuary
known
as
the
octavem
or
oitaben
a
broad
tidal
stretch
of
water
where
several
small
mountain
torrents
meet
at
the
head
of
a
long
bay
noroña
might
have
disputed
the
lines
of
the
ulla
and
the
vedra
but
neither
of
these
rivers
affords
such
a
good
defensive
position
as
the
oitaben
here
the
hills
of
the
interior
come
down
much
nearer
to
the
sea
than
they
do
at
the
mouths
of
the
ulla
and
the
vedra
so
that
there
is
a
much
shorter
line
to
defend
between
mark
and
the
foot
of
the
inaccessible
sierra
de
suido
there
was
no
road
inland
by
which
the
position
could
be
turned
so
that
the
galicians
had
only
to
guard
the
six
miles
of
between
the
sea
and
the
mountain
there
were
two
bridges
to
be
watched
the
more
important
was
that
of
sampayo
where
the
main
to
vigo
passes
the
oitaben
just
where
it
narrows
down
and
ceases
to
be
tidal
the
second
was
that
of
caldelas
four
miles
further
inland
where
a
to
the
village
of
sotomayor
crosses
the
verdugo
the
most
northern
of
the
three
torrents
which
unite
to
form
the
oitaben
noroña
had
broken
down
four
arches
of
the
great
sampayo
bridge
that
of
caldelas
he
had
not
destroyed
but
had
barricaded
he
had
drawn
a
double
line
of
trenches
on
the
hillside
that
dominates
it
and
placed
there
a
battery
containing
some
of
his
small
provision
of
artillery
he
had
but
nine
and
two
mortars
taken
from
the
walls
of
vigo
morillo
was
given
charge
of
this
part
of
the
position
noroña
took
post
himself
at
sampayo
he
had
neglected
no
minor
precaution
that
was
possible
some
gunboats
one
of
which
was
manned
by
english
sailors
drawn
from
the
two
frigates
in
the
bay
patrolled
the
tidal
part
of
the
oitaben
and
flanked
the
broken
bridge

the
senior
naval
officer

put
his
marines
on
shore
along
with
sixty
stragglers
from
moore
s
army
who
had
been
liberated
by
the
peasants
from
french
captivity
they
garrisoned
vigo
which
lies
a
few
miles
beyond
the
oitaben
on
june
ney
reached
the
front
of
the
position
and
ascertained
that
the
bridge
of
sampayo
was
broken
his
artillery
exchanged
some
objectless
salvos
with
that
of
noroña
while
his
cavalry
rode
inland
to
look
for
possible
points
of
passage
they
could
find
none
save
the
fortified
bridge
of
caldelas
and
a
very
difficult
ford
just
above
it
commanded
like
the
bridge
by
the
spanish
trenches
on
the
hillside
the
marshal
was
also
informed
that
at
the
sampayo
itself
there
was
another
ford
passable
only
at
low
tide
for
three
hours
at
a
time
these
reports
were
by
no
means
encouraging
the
spanish
position
was
almost
impregnable
and
there
was
no
way
of
turning
it
indeed
the
only
road
by
which
the
enemy
could
be
taken
in
flank
or
rear
was
that
from
orense
to
vigo
along
the
minho
this
ney
could
not
reach
but
supposing
that
soult
had
carried
out
the
plan
of
operations
to
which
he
had
assented
on
june
it
was
just
possible
that
he
might
appear
sooner
or
later
on
that
line
and
so
dislodge
the
enemy
however
it
was
equally
possible
that
he
might
be
still
far
distant
and
so
ney
resolved
to
make
an
attempt
to
force
the
passage
of
the
oitaben
on
the
morning
of
june
therefore
after
a
long
but
fruitless
cannonade
one
body
of
infantry
endeavoured
to
pass
at
the
ford
opposite
the
village
of
sampayo
while
another
with
some
cavalry
attempted
to
cross
the
other
ford
at
caldelas
and
to
storm
its
bridge
at
both
places
the
galicians
stood
their
ground
and
the
heads
of
the
column
were
exposed
to
such
a
furious
fire
that
they
suffered
heavily
and
failed
to
reach
the
further
bank
the
marshal
therefore
drew
them
back
and
refused
to
persist
in
an
attack
which
would
only
have
had
a
chance
of
success
if
the
enemy
had
misbehaved
and
given
way
to
panic
the
french
lost
several
hundred
men
the
galicians
safe
in
their
trenches
suffered
far
less
carrol
writing
from
vigo
two
days
later
says
that
the
french
infantry
seemed
determined
any
to
cross
the
water
at
low
tide
that
they
came
on
very
boldly
but
could
not
face
the
fire
and
finally
gave
back
carrol
in
the
letter
just
quoted
says
that
dead
bodies
were
left
before
the
of
caldelas
which
the
french
could
not
carry
off
because
of
the
hot
fire
that
played
upon
the
spot
he
estimates
the
french
total
loss
at
while
that
of
noroña
was
only
that
evening
ney
received
news
which
convinced
him
that
soult
had
left
him
in
the
lurch
and
had
no
intention
of
prosecuting
his
march
on
orense
to
turn
the
enemy
s
flank
it
was
reported
that
the
corps
after
making
only
two
days
march
from
lugo
had
stopped
short
at
monforte
de
lemos
and
showed
no
signs
of
moving
forward
indeed
the
duke
of
dalmatia
had
put
the
regiments
into
cantonments
and
was
evidently
about
to
make
a
lengthy
halt
since
the
duke
of
elchingen
was
now
convinced
that
the
enemy
could
not
be
dislodged
from
behind
the
oitaben
without
his
colleague
s
aid
and
since
that
colleague
showed
no
signs
of
appearing
within
any
reasonable
time
the
game
was
up
on
the
morning
of
the
ninth
ney
gave
orders
for
his
troops
to
draw
off
and
to
retire
by
the
road
to
santiago
and
corunna
he
made
no
secret
of
his
belief
that
soult
had
deliberately
betrayed
him
and
had
never
intended
to
keep
his
promise
without
the
aid
of
the
corps
he
had
no
hopes
of
being
able
to
suppress
the
galician
insurrection
but
till
he
should
learn
precisely
what
his
colleague
was
doing
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
abandon
the
province
he
therefore
sent
off
on
june
an
with
a
large
escort
by
the
circuitous
route
via
lugo
this
officer
bore
a
dispatch
which
explained
the
situation
reported
the
check
at
sampayo
and
demanded
that
the
corps
should
not
move
any
further
away
but
should
return
to
lend
aid
to
the
in
its
time
of
need
it
was
more
than
ten
days
before
an
answer
was
received
but
on
the
soult
s
reply
came
to
hand
he
had
been
found
marching
not
towards
orense
but
eastward
in
the
direction
of
the
frontiers
of
leon
he
refused
to
turn
back
alleging
that
this
was
not
in
the
bond
signed
at
lugo
and
that
his
troops
were
in
such
a
state
of
exhaustion
that
he
was
forced
to
lead
them
into
the
plains
to
rest
them
and
refit
them
such
a
reply
seemed
to
justify
ney
s
worst
suspicions
abandoned
by
his
colleague
and
with
the
care
of
the
whole
of
galicia
thrown
upon
his
hands
he
refused
to
risk
the
safety
of
the
corps
in
the
unequal
struggle
he
evacuated
corunna
and
ferrol
on
the
and
concentrated
his
whole
force
at
lugo
there
he
picked
up
the
sick
and
wounded
of
soult
s
corps
as
well
as
his
own
and
in
six
forced
marches
retired
along
the
by
villafranca
to
astorga
which
place
he
reached
on
june
every
day
he
had
been
worried
and
molested
by
the
local
guerrillas
but
neither
noroña
nor
la
romana
had
dared
to
meddle
with
him
in
his
anger
at
the
constant
attacks
of
the
insurgents
he
sacked
every
place
that
he
passed
from
villafranca
and
ponferrada
down
to
the
smallest
hamlets
galician
towns
and
villages
are
said
to
have
been
burned
by
the
corps
during
its
retreat
such
conduct
was
unworthy
of
a
soldier
of
ney
s
calibre
it
can
only
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
he
was
almost
beside
himself
with
wrath
at
being
foiled
by
soult
s
breach
of
his
plighted
word
and
vented
his
fury
on
the
only
victims
that
he
could
reach
i
have
been
assured
says
napier
ii
by
an
officer
of
ney
s
personal
staff
d
esménard
that
he
rashly
concluded
that
personal
feelings
had
swayed
soult
to
betray
the
corps
in
this
error
he
returned
in
wrath
to
but
was
his
conclusion
rash
or
wrong
we
must
now
turn
back
to
trace
the
steps
of
the
corps
in
its
devious
march
from
lugo
to
the
plains
of
leon
soult
had
sent
out
loison
with
one
division
by
the
road
down
the
left
bank
of
the
minho
on
june
he
himself
followed
with
the
rest
of
the
army
on
the
next
day
on
the
third
the
marshal
reached
the
little
town
of
monforte
de
lemos
between
the
minho
and
the
sil
which
he
found
deserted
by
its
inhabitants
in
obedience
to
la
romana
s
orders
they
had
all
gone
up
into
the
mountains
if
soult
had
been
honestly
desirous
of
carrying
out
his
compact
with
ney
his
next
step
would
have
been
to
make
a
rapid
march
on
orense
he
must
have
been
able
to
calculate
that
his
colleague
would
now
be
in
touch
with
noroña
s
forces
somewhere
to
the
south
of
corunna
and
it
was
his
duty
to
by
descending
the
minho
in
the
enemy
s
rear
the
mere
fact
that
he
remained
for
the
unconscionable
space
of
eight
days
at
monforte
is
a
sufficient
proof
that
he
never
intended
to
carry
out
his
part
of
the
compact
during
this
time
june
while
ney
was
fighting
out
to
an
unsuccessful
end
his
campaign
against
noroña
soult
was
absolutely
quiescent
at
a
place
only
thirty
miles
from
his
at
lugo
he
was
unmolested
save
by
small
bands
of
local
guerrillas
who
fled
to
the
hills
whenever
they
were
faced
his
official
chronicler
le
noble
pleads
that
there
were
no
fords
to
be
found
either
over
the
minho
or
over
the
sil
but
in
eight
days
unopposed
by
any
serious
enemy
the
engineers
of
the
corps
could
certainly
have
built
bridges
if
the
marshal
had
ordered
them
to
do
so
meanwhile
the
troops
rested
and
rejoiced
in
the
abundant
supplies
of
food
and
wine
which
they
gathered
in
from
the
neighbourhood
for
monforte
lies
in
the
centre
of
a
fertile
upland
and
its
neighbourhood
had
never
before
suffered
from
the
ills
of
war
le
noble
fantin
des
odoards
on
the
eleventh
soult
at
last
moved
on
but
it
was
not
in
the
direction
of
orense
he
had
no
news
of
ney
and
professed
to
be
concerned
that
the
corps
had
not
yet
been
heard
of
on
the
orense
road
finally
he
announced
that
he
was
compelled
to
believe
that
the
duke
of
elchingen
had
not
executed
his
part
of
the
joint
campaign
and
that
there
was
no
longer
any
reason
that
the
corps
should
carry
out
its
share
of
the
plan
accordingly
he
marched
not
toward
ney
but
in
the
opposite
direction
up
the
valley
of
the
sil
with
his
face
set
towards
the
east
he
pretended
that
he
hoped
to
catch
and
disperse
the
corps
of
la
romana
to
whom
he
attributed
a
design
of
marching
on
puebla
de
senabria
the
same
movement
that
the
marquis
had
executed
once
before
in
the
first
days
of
march
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
la
romana
was
at
orense
and
far
from
having
any
intention
of
retreating
eastward
if
he
were
attacked
by
the
corps
he
was
looking
on
portugal
as
his
line
of
retreat

that
he
had
been
intending
to
march
by
to
fall
on
ney
s
flank
and
so
aid
the
division
of
noroña
but
soult
s
appearance
at
monforte
with
men
an
compels
him
to
remain
behind
to
observe
that

the
thirteenth

reached
montefurado
where
the

is
bridged
by
masses
of
rocks
which
have
fallen
into
its
bed
the
river
forces
its
way
beneath
them
by
a
tunnel
sixty
feet
broad
which
is
supposed
to
have
been
cut
by
the
romans
crossing
on
this
natural
bridge
he
turned
southward
to
follow
the
valley
of
the
bibey
which
leads
to
puebla
de
senabria
and
the
plains
of
leon
he
met
no
resistance
save
from
the
local
insurgents
headed
by
the
abbot
of
casoyo
and
a
partisan
called
el
salamanquino
who
received
little
or
no
aid
from
the
regular
army
indeed
the
only
spanish
troops
in
this
remote
corner
of
galicia
were
men
under
an
officer
called
echevarria
a
dépôt
left
behind
at
puebla
de
senabria
by
la
carrera
when
he
had
marched
to
vigo
in
may
this
handful
of
men
joined
the
local
guerrillas
and
the
appearance
of
their
uniforms
among
the
enemy
s
ranks
served
soult
as
an
excuse
for
stating
that
he
was
contending
with
the
army
of
la
romana
any
reader
of
his
dispatches
would
conclude
that
during
the
last
days
of
june
he
was
opposed
by
a
considerable
body
of
that
force
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
never
anywhere
near
the
galician
army
which
lay
first
at
orense
then
at
celanova
finally
at
monterey
on
the
portuguese
frontier
always
moving
to
the
right
parallel
with
the
marshal
s
advance
so
as
to
avoid
being
outflanked
on
its
southern
wing
it
was
with
the
peasants
of
the
valley
of
the
bibey
alone
that
soult
had
to
do
thrusting
them
to
right
and
left
and
cruelly
ravaging
the
on
both
banks
of
the
river
he
reached
viana
on
june
from
thence
franceschi
sent
a
flying
expedition
over
the
hills
to
la
gudina
on
the
road
from
monterey
to
puebla
de
senabria
it
brought
back
news
that
la
romana
had
come
down
to
monterey
when
the
corps
moved
to
viana
but
that
he
was
evidently
not
marching
eastward
it
had
met
and
routed
a
party
of
spanish
cavalry
sent
out
from
monterey
the
prisoners
taken
from
them
said
that
the
marquis
was
returning
to
orense
now
that
he
had
seen
the
corps
committing
itself
to
an
advance
up
the
valley
of
the
bibey
and
passing
away
in
the
direction
of
the
plains
of
leon
carrol
was
with
this
party
he
had
come
out
from
vigo
to
join
la
romana
was
at
la
gudina
on
june
and
retreated
to
monterey
when
franceschi
attacked
that
point
the
marquis
turned
back
when
he
saw
franceschi
move
off
eastward
and
retired
to
his
old
head
quarters
at
orense
if
soult
had
pushed
westward
the
spaniards
had
the
choice
between
the
road
to
chaves
and
that
back
to
orense
and
were
in
no
danger
it
was
while
halting
at
larouco
during
this
march
that
soult
received
the
dispatch
which
ney
had
written
to
him
from
santiago
on
june
his
reply
as
we
have
already
seen
was
a
peremptory
refusal
to
turn
back
to
the
aid
of
the
corps
he
asserted
that
he
had
fulfilled
his
part
of
the
bargain
made
at
lugo
which
he
assuredly
had
not
and
refused
to
undertake
any
further
offensive
operations
with
troops
in
a
state
of
utter
destitution
and
fatigue
he
declared
to
his
staff
and
wrote
to
king
joseph
that
he
believed
that
ney
had
deliberately
mismanaged
his
expedition
against
vigo
and
had
suffered
himself
to
be
checked
in
order
to
have
an
excuse
for
detaining
the
corps
in
galicia
why
he
asked
had
not
the
duke
of
elchingen
sent
a
turning
column
against
orense
instead
of
making
a
frontal
attack
against
the
line
of
the
oitaben
the
plain
answer
to
this
query
viz
that
ney
with
a
of
only
men
and
having
three
weak
garrisons
behind
him
could
not
afford
either
to
divide
his
army
or
to
go
too
far
from
corunna
and
lugo
he
naturally
did
not
give

accordingly
on
june
soult
abandoned
the
valley
of
the
bibey
and
crossed
the
watershed
of
the
sierra
segundera
in
two
columns
one
descending
on
to
la
gudina
the
other
on
to
lobian
on
the
and
the
whole
army
was
united
at
puebla
de
senabria
the
town
was
taken
without
a
shot
being
fired
and
the
french
found
there
several
cannon
which
la
carrera
had
not
carried
off
when
he
marched
to
vigo
and
which
echevarria
had
spiked
but
neglected
to
destroy
the
corps
rested
for
five
days
in
puebla
de
senabria
where
it
obtained
abundance
of
food
and
comfortable
lodging
but
franceschi
and
his
now
reduced
to
not
more
than
sabres
were
pushed
on
at
once
to
zamora
to
bear
news
to
king
joseph
of
the
approach
of
the
corps
and
to
beg
that
the
stores
money
artillery
and
clothing
which
soult
had
demanded
in
his
letter
from
lugo
might
be
forwarded
to
him
as
soon
as
possible
although
the
authorities
at
madrid
had
heard
nothing
of
the
doings
of
the
marshal
since
june
they
had
already
prepared
much
of
the
material
required
and
sent
it
to
salamanca
from
thence
it
was
now
transferred
to
zamora
and
benavente
where
it
was
handed
over
to
the
corps
other
stores
were
procured
from
valladolid
and
even
from
bayonne
but
the
artillery
the
most
important
of
all
the
necessaries
was
long
in
coming
on
reaching
zamora
franceschi
handed
over
the
charge
of
his
division
to
general
pierre
soult
the
marshal
s
brother
and
rode
on
towards
madrid
with
no
escort
but
two
they
were
captured
near
toro
by
the
celebrated
guerrilla
chief
el
capuchino
fray
juan
delica
who
sent
the
important
dispatches
which
they
were
bearing
to
seville
frere
instantly
forwarded
a
copy
to
wellesley
july
who
thus
got
invaluable
information
as
to
soult
s
situation
and
future
intentions
in
the
record
office
there
is
a
letter
requesting
that
the
news
of
franceschi
s
captivity
may
be
sent
to
his
wife
in
paris
which
was
duly
done
the
unfortunate
general
was
imprisoned
first
at
granada
and
then
at
cartagena
in
both
places
it
is
said
he
was
treated
with
unjustifiable
rigour
and
kept
in
close
confinement
within
four
walls
it
was
the
same
usage
that
napoleon
meted
out
to
palafox
he
died
of
a
fever
in
after
two
years
captivity
soult
s
main
body
had
broken
up
from
puebla
de
senabria
on
june
from
thence
mermet
s
delaborde
s
and
lorges
troops
marched
to
benavente
and
those
of
merle
and
heudelet
to
zamora
in
these
places
they
enjoyed
a
few
days
of
rest
and
began
to
refit
themselves
but
it
was
not
long
before
they
were
called
upon
to
take
part
in
another
great
campaign
and
once
more
to
face
their
old
enemies
the
english
the
first
care
of
the
duke
of
dalmatia
after
he
had
emerged
from
the
galician
sierras
had
been
to
write
long
justificatory
dispatches
to
the
emperor
and
king
joseph
they
are
most
interesting
documents
and
explain
with
perfect
clearness
his
reasons
for
abandoning
ney
and
returning
to
the
valley
of
the
douro
his
main
thesis
is
that
it
was
his
duty
to
keep
the
english
in
check
since
they
were
the
one
really
dangerous
enemy
in
the
peninsula
since
it
was
notorious
that
wellesley
had
quitted
northern
portugal
it
was
practically
certain
that
he
must
be
intending
to
march
southward
to
fall
upon
victor
and
strike
a
blow
at
madrid
it
was
necessary
therefore
that
the
corps
should
follow
him
and
be
ready
to
aid
in
the
defence
of
the
capital
the
safety
of
madrid
was
far
more
important
than
the
subjection
of
galicia
and
the
marshal
had
no
hesitation
in
sacrificing
the
lesser
object
in
order
to
secure
the
greater
ney
he
thought
would
be
strong
enough
to
make
head
against
noroña
and
la
romana
united
but
he
could
not
hope
to
hold
down
the
whole
of
galicia
and
he
would
have
either
to
be
reinforced
or
to
be
permitted
to
evacuate
the
province
as
to
the
conquest
of
galicia
it
would
take
many
men
and
many
months
at
present
it
would
be
impossible
to
find
the
forces
necessary
for
its
complete
subjection
this
could
only
be
done
by
fortifying
not
merely
corunna
ferrol
and
lugo
but
also
tuy
monterey
viana
and
puebla
de
senabria
each
of
these
places
should
be
given
a
garrison
of
or
men
and
furnished
with
stores
calculated
to
last
for
four
months
in
addition
there
would
have
to
be
blockhouses
built
along
the
from
lugo
to
villafranca
and
on
several
other
lines
columns
operating
from
each
of
the
seven
great
garrisons
should
be
continually
moving
about
keeping
open
the
communication
between
stronghold
and
stronghold
and
chastising
the
insurgents
thus
soult
calculated
that
the
subjection
of
galicia
would
require
from
to
men
continually
on
the
move
and
never
liable
to
be
called
upon
for
any
service
outside
the
province
it
was
absurd
therefore
for
him
to
suggest
in
a
later
paragraph
that
ney
might
be
left
to
hold
his
own
what
was
the
use
of
setting
men
to
work
on
a
task
that
would
strain
the
energies
of
and
where
was
king
joseph
to
find
the
additional
men
if
the
corps
were
withdrawn
into
leon
to
watch
the
british
army
no
such
force
could
be
drawn
from
any
other
part
of
spain
and
it
would
be
useless
to
ask
for
reinforcements
from
france
while
the
austrian
war
was
calling
every
available
man
to
the
danube
soult
s
view
clearly
was
that
galicia
would
have
to
be
abandoned
for
the
present
though
he
did
not
choose
to
say
so
till
the
english
had
been
destroyed
or
driven
into
the
sea
king
joseph
would
never
be
able
to
find
men
to
lock
up
in
the
remote
and
mountainous
corner
of
the
peninsula
there
is
so
much
valuable
information
in
these
dispatches
of
soult
dated
june
from
puebla
de
senabria
that
i
have
printed
the
most
important
paragraphs
as
an
appendix
omitting
the
lengthy
narrative
of
the
operations
on
the
sil
and
the
bibey
in
which
the
marshal
vainly
flattered
himself
that
he
had
dispersed
the
armies
of
la
romana
and
chavarria
echevarria
there
is
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
soult
s
views
were
perfectly
correct
looking
at
the
war
in
the
peninsula
as
a
whole
it
was
a
strategical
blunder
to
endeavour
to
hold
galicia
before
portugal
had
been
conquered
and
while
the
force
of
the
french
armies
in
spain
remained
at
its
present
figure
it
was
impossible
to
spare
two
whole
army
corps
for
this
secondary
theatre
of
operations
the
attempt
to
subdue
the
province
had
only
been
made
because
moore
had
drawn
after
him
to
corunna
the
armies
of
soult
and
ney
and
since
they
were
on
the
spot
the
temptation
to
use
them
there
was
too
great
to
be
withstood
this
is
but
one
more
instance
of
the
way
in
which
the
famous
march
to
sahagun
had
disarranged
all
the
emperor
s
original
plans
for
the
conquest
of
the
peninsula
it
has
often
been
debated
whether
it
would
be
truer
to
say
that
galicia
was
delivered
by
wellesley
s
operations
or
by
the
valour
and
obstinacy
of
its
own
inhabitants
after
giving
all
due
credit
to
the
gallant
peasantry
who
checked
ney
and
harassed
soult
to
the
prudence
of
the
untiring
la
romana
and
to
noroña
s
cautious
courage
it
is
yet
necessary
to
decide
that
the
real
cause
of
the
evacuation
of
the
province
by
the
invaders
was
the
presence
of
the
victorious
british
army
in
portugal
the
two
marshals
might
have
maintained
themselves
there
for
an
indefinite
time
if
they
could
have
shut
their
eyes
to
what
was
going
on
elsewhere
but
soult
was
quite
right
in
believing
that
it
would
be
mad
to
persist
in
the
attempt
to
subdue
galicia
while
wellesley
was
in
the
field
and
nothing
lay
between
him
and
madrid
but
the
men
of
the
corps
if
he
and
ney
had
lingered
on
in
the
north
engaged
in
fruitless
hunting
after
la
romana
while
july
and
august
wore
on
madrid
would
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
wellesley
and
cuesta
and
king
joseph
would
once
more
have
been
forced
to
go
upon
his
travels
to
burgos
or
elsewhere
the
talavera
campaign
only
failed
of
success
because
the
and
the
corps
were
withdrawn
from
the
galician
hills
just
in
time
to
concentrate
at
salamanca
and
fall
upon
the
rear
of
the
victors
if
they
had
been
wandering
around
monterey
or
mondonedo
at
the
end
of
july
instead
of
being
cantoned
in
the
plains
of
leon
the
capital
of
spain
would
undoubtedly
have
been
recovered
by
wellesley
and
cuesta
though
whether
those
colleagues
could
have
held
it
for
long
is
another
question
into
such
possibilities
it
is
useless
to
make
inquiry
my
best
authority
for
this
campaign
is
the
set
of
dispatches
by
carrol
in
the
record
office
he
was
at
vigo
from
june
to
june
with
la
romana
from
june
to
july
thus
he
was
on
the
spot
for
the
fight
on
the
oitaben
and
also
for
the
operations
against
soult
napier
s
narrative
is
more
than
usually
faulty
in
dealing
with
the
end
of
the
galician
campaign
he
writes
as
a
partisan
of
soult
and
his
whole
tale
is
drawn
from
the
marshal
s
dispatches
and
from
the
book
of
the
panegyrist
le
noble
his
whole
picture
of
the
desperate
condition
of
la
romana
is
untrue
the
marquis
had
always
open
to
him
a
safe
retreat
into
portugal
and
his
army
was
never
engaged
with
soult
at
all
carrol
s
dispatches
make
this
quite
clear
the
map
facing
of
vol
ii
is
so
hopelessly
inaccurate
both
as
to
distances
and
as
to
the
relative
positions
of
places
to
each
other
that
i
can
only
compare
it
to
those
ingenious
diagrams
which
a
railway
produces
in
order
to
show
that
it
possesses
the
shortest
route
from
london
to
edinburgh

from
brussels
to

desperate
bands
were
removed
it
would
be
easy
to
trample
down
aragon
to
take
catalonia
in
the
rear
and
finally
to
march
to
the
gates
of
valencia
and
end
the
struggle
on
the
eastern
coast
now
at
last
the
men
of
mortier
and
junot
could
be
turned
to
other
tasks
and
there
seemed
to
be
every
reason
to
expect
that
they
would
suffice
to
carry
out
the
emperor
s
designs
there
was
no
army
which
could
be
opposed
to
them
for
only
a
few
days
after
the
capitulation
of
saragossa
reding
had
risked
and
lost
the
battle
of
valls
and
the
wrecks
of
his
host

taken
refuge
within
the
walls
of
tarragona
the
only
surviving
spanish
force
which
was
under
arms
in
the
valley
of
the
ebro
consisted
of
the
single
division
not
more
than
strong
under
the
marquis
of
lazan
after
his
vain
attempt
to
come
to
the
rescue
of
saragossa
in
the
early
days
of
february
lazan
had
drawn
back
to
fraga
and
monzon
forced
to
look
on
from
afar
at
the
last
stage
of
his
brother
s
desperate
resistance
in
the
rest
of
the
kingdom
of
aragon
there
were
but
two
or
three
scattered
battalions
of
new
levies
and
some
guerrilla
bands

perena
and
other
chiefs

the
mistaken
policy
which
had
led
joseph
palafox
to
shut
up
in
saragossa
not
only
his
own
army
but
also
the
succours
which
he
had
procured
from
valencia
and
murcia
now
bore
its
fruit
there
was
no
force
left
which
could
take
the
field
against
the
victorious
army
of
lannes
it
seemed
therefore
that
the
war
in
aragon
must
come
to
a
speedy
end
the
french
had
but
to
advance
and
the
whole
kingdom
must
fall
into
their
hands
the
national
cause
however
was
not
quite
so
desperate
as
might
have
been
supposed
here
as
in
other
regions
of
spain
it
was
ere
long
to
be
discovered
that
it
was
one
thing
to
destroy
a
spanish
army
and
another
to
hold
down
a
spanish
province
a
french
corps
that
was
irresistible
when
concentrated
on
the
field
of
battle
became
vulnerable
when
forced
to
divide
itself
into
the
number
of
small
garrisons
that
were
needed
for
the
permanent
retention
of
the
territory
that
it
had
won
though
the
capital
of
aragon
and
its
chief
towns
were
to
remain
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
for
the
next
five
years
yet
there
were
always
rugged
corners
of
the
land
where
the
struggle
was
kept
up
and
the
invader
baffled
and
held
in
check
yet
immediately
after
the
fall
of
saragossa
it
seemed
for
a
space
that
aragon
might
settle
down
beneath
the
invader
s
heel
lannes
whose
health
was
still
bad
returned
to
france
but
mortier
and
junot
who
now
once
more
resumed
that
joint
responsibility
that
they
had
shared
in
december
went
forth
conquering
and
to
conquer
they
so
divided
their
efforts
that
the
corps
operated
for
the
most
part
to
the
north
and
the
corps
to
the
south
of
the
ebro
though
occasionally
their
lines
of
operations
crossed
each
other
the
kingdom
of
aragon
consists
of
three
divisions
on
each
side
of
the
ebro
there
is
a
wide
and
fertile
plain
generally
some
thirty
miles
broad
but
to
the
north
and
the
south
of
this
rich
valley
lie
range
on
range
of
rugged
hills
those
on
the
north
are
the
lower
spurs
of
the
pyrenees
those
to
the
south
form
part
of
the
great
central
ganglion
of
the
sierras
of
central
spain
which
lies
just
where
aragon
valencia
and
new
castile
meet
the
valley
of
the
ebro
gave
the
french
little
trouble
it
was
not
a
region
that
could
easily
offer
resistance
for
it
was
destitute
of
all
natural
defences
moreover
the
flower
of
its
manhood
had
been
enrolled
in
the
battalions
which
had
perished
at
saragossa
and
few
were
left
in
the
who
were
capable
of
bearing
arms
still
fewer
who
possessed
them
the
plain
of
central
aragon
lay
exhausted
at
the
victor
s
feet
it
was
otherwise
with
the
mountains
of
the
north
and
the
south
which
contain
some
of
the
most
difficult
ground
in
the
whole
of
spain
there
the
rough
and
sturdy
found
every
opportunity
for
resistance
and
when
once
they
had
learnt
by
experience
the
limitations
of
the
invader
s
power
were
able
to
keep
up
a
petty
warfare
without
an
end
partisans
like
villacampa
in
the
southern
hills
and
mina
in
the
pyrenean
valleys
along
the
edge
of
navarre
succeeded
in
maintaining
themselves
against
every
expedition
that
was
sent
against
them
always
hunted
often
brought
to
bay
they
yet
were
never
crushed
or
destroyed
but
in
march
the
aragonese
had
not
yet
recognized
their
own
opportunities
the
disaster
of
saragossa
had
struck
such
a
deep
blow
that
apathy
and
despair
seemed
to
have
spread
over
the
greater
part
of
the
kingdom
when
mortier
and
junot
after
giving
their
corps
a
short
rest
began
to
spread
movable
columns
abroad
there
was
at
first
no
resistance
the
inaccessible
fortress
of
jaca
in
the
of
the
pyrenees
surrendered
at
the
first
summons
its
garrison
was
only
strong
yet
it
should
have
made
some
sort
of
defence
against
a
force
consisting
of
no
more
than
a
single
regiment
of
mortier
s
corps
without
artillery
march
the
fall
of
this
place
was
important
as
it
commands
the
only
pass
in
the
central
pyrenees
which
is
anything
better
than
though
barely
practicable
for
artillery
or
light
vehicles
it
was
useful
for
communication
between
saragossa
and
france
and
gave
the
french
army
of
aragon
a
line
of
communication
of
its
own
independent
of
the
long
and
circuitous
route
by
tudela
and
pampeluna
toreno
gives
some
curious
details
about
the
surrender
of
jaca
which
he
says
was
largely
due
to
the
intrigues
of
a
friar
named
josé
de
consolation
who
preached
resignation
and
submission
to
god
s
will
in
such
moving
terms
that
the
greater
part
of
the
garrison
deserted
he
was
afterwards
found
to
have
been
an
agent
of
the
french
the
central
junta
sent
the
governor
campos
the
corregidor
arcón
and
the
officers
commanding
the
artillery
and
engineers
before
a
which
condemned
them
all
to
death
only
the
engineer
was
caught
he
had
openly
joined
the
french
and
shot

the
chief

in

valley
of
the
cinca
on
their
approach
the
marquis
of
lazan
retired
down
the
ebro
to
tortosa
and
both
towns
were
occupied
without
offering
resistance
another
column
marched
against
mequinenza
the
fortress
at
the
junction
of
the
ebro
and
segre
here
however
they
met
with
opposition
the
place
was
only
protected
by
antiquated
fortifications
but
it
twice
refused
to
surrender
though
on
the
second
occasion
mortier
himself
appeared
before
its
walls
with
a
whole
brigade
the
marshal
did
not
besiege
it
deferring
this
task
till
he
should
have
got
all
of
eastern
aragon
well
in
hand
at
this
same
time
he
made
an
attempt
to
open
communications
with
cyr
in
catalonia
sending
a
regiment
of
cavalry
under
colonel
briche
to
strike
across
the
mountains
beyond
the
segre
in
search
of
the
corps
briche
executed
half
his
mission
for
by
great
good
fortune
combined
with
very
rapid
movement
he
slipped
between
lerida
and
mequinenza
got
down
into
the
and
met
chabot
s
division
of
cyr
s
army
at
montblanch
when
however
he
tried
to
return
to
aragon
in
order
to
convey
to
the
duke
of
treviso
the
information
as
to
the
distribution
of
the
corps
he
was
beset
by
the
who
were
now
on
the
alert
so
vigorously
was
he
assailed
that
he
was
forced
to
turn
back
and
seek
refuge
with
chabot
thus
mortier
gained
none
of
the
news
that
he
sought
and
very
naturally
came
to
the
conclusion
that
his
flying
column
had
been
captured
or
cut
to
pieces
meanwhile
junot
and
the
corps
were
operating
south
of
the
ebro
the
duke
of
abrantes
sent
one
of
his
three
divisions
that
of
grandjean
against
caspe
alcañiz
and
the
valleys
of
the
guadalope
and
martin
while
another
that
of
musnier
moved
out
against
the
highlands
of
the
south
and
the
of
daroca
and
molina
most
of
the
battalions
of
his
third
division
that
of
morlot
were
still
engaged
in
guarding
on
their
way
to
france
the
prisoners
of
saragossa
of
the
two
expeditions
which
junot
sent
out
that
which
entered
the
mountains
effected
little
it
lost
several
small
detachments
cut
off
by
the
local
insurgents
and
though
it
ultimately
penetrated
as
far
as
molina
it
was
unable
to
hold
the
place
the
whole
population
had
fled
and
after
remaining
there
only
six
days
the
french
were
forced
to
return
to
the
plains
by
want
of
food
march
april
the
aragonese
at
once
came
back
to
their
former
position
grandjean
who
had
moved
against
alcañiz
had
at
first
more
favourable
fortune
he
overran
with
great
ease
all
the
country
south
of
the
ebro
and
met
with
so
little
opposition
that
he
resolved
to
push
his
advance
even
beyond
the
borders
of
valencia
accordingly
he
ascended
the
valley
of
the
bercantes
and
appeared
before
morella
the
frontier
town
of
that
kingdom
on
march
the
place
was
strong
but
there
was
only
a
very
small
garrison
in
charge
of
it
which
retired
after
a
slight
skirmish
abandoning
the
fortress
and
a
large
store
of
food
and
equipment
if
grandjean
could
have
held
morella
he
would
have
secured
for
the
french
army
a
splendid
base
for
further
operations
but
he
had
left
many
men
behind
him
at
caspe
and
alcañiz
and
had
but
a
few
battalions
in
hand
he
had
gone
too
far
forward
to
be
safe
and
when
the
junta
of
valencia
sent
against
him
the
whole
of
the
forces
that
they
could
collect
some
men
under
general
roca
he
was
compelled
to
evacuate
morella
and
to
fall
back
on
alcañiz
march
only
the
single
regiment
america
whose
cadre
sent
back
by
infantado
from
cuenca
was
being
filled
up
with
recruits
from
the
morella
district
junot
to
king
joseph
from
saragossa
march
mortier
and
junot
were
concerting
a
joint
movement
for
the
completion
of
the
conquest
of
eastern
aragon
and
an
advance
against
tortosa
when
orders
from
paris
suddenly
changed
the
whole
face
of
affairs
the
emperor
saw
that
war
with
austria
was
inevitable
and
imminent
disquieted
as
to
the
strength
of
the
new
enemy
he
resolved
to
draw
troops
from
spain
to
reinforce
the
army
of
the
danube
the
only
corps
which
seemed
to
him
available
was
that
of
mortier
and
on
april
he
ordered
that
the
duke
of
treviso
should
concentrate
his
troops
and
draw
back
to
tudela
and
logroño
it
might
still
prove
to
be
unnecessary
to
remove
the
corps
from
the
peninsula
but
at
logroño
it
would
be
within
four
marches
of
france
if
the
emperor
discovered
that
he
had
need
of
its
services
in
the
north
on
the
same
day
napoleon
removed
junot
from
his
command
probably
on
account
of
the
numerous
complaints
as
to
his
conduct
sent
in
by
king
joseph
to
replace
him
general
suchet
the
commander
of
one
of
mortier
s
divisions
was
directed
to
take
charge
of
the
corps
see
joseph
s
letter
of
april
and
the
emperor
s
orders
from
paris
of
april
and
april
ten
days
later
the
imperial
mandate
reached
saragossa
and
on
receiving
it
mortier
massed
his
troops
and
marched
away
to
tudela
we
have
already
seen
that
his
corps
was
never
withdrawn
from
spain
but
merely
moved
from
aragon
to
old
castile
but
its
departure
completely
changed
the
balance
of
fortune
on
the
lower
ebro
the
number
of
french
troops
in
that
direction
was
suddenly
reduced
by
one
half
and
the
corps
had
to
spread
itself
out
to
the
north
in
order
to
take
over
all
the
positions
evacuated
by
mortier
it
was
far
too
weak
for
the
duty
committed
to
its
charge
and
at
this
moment
it
had
not
even
received
back
the
brigade
sent
to
guard
the
saragossa
prisoners
which
it
will
be
remembered
had
been
called
off
and
lent
to
kellermann
there
were
hardly
troops
left
in
the
whole
kingdom
of
aragon
and
these
were
dispersed
in
small
bodies
with
the
design
of
holding
down
as
much
ground
as
possible
the
single
division
of
grandjean
had
to
cover
the
whole
line
from
barbastro
to
alcañiz
places
seventy
miles
apart
with
less
than
bayonets
the
second
division
musnier
s
with
its
head
quarters
at
saragossa
had
to
watch
the
mountains
of
upper
aragon
of
the
division
that
of
morlot
the
few
battalions
that
were
available
were
garrisoning
jaca
and
tudela
on
the
borders
of
navarre
no
sooner
had
mortier
s
corps
departed
than
a
series
of
small
reverses
occurred
the
inevitable
results
of
the
attempt
to
hold
down
large
districts
with
an
inadequate
force
junot
who
was
still
retained
in
command
till
his
successor
should
arrive
seemed
to
lack
the
courage
to
draw
in
his
exposed
detachments
probably
his
heart
was
no
longer
in
the
business
since
he
was
under
sentence
of
recall
yet
he
had
six
weeks
of
work
before
him
for
by
some
mischance
the
dispatch
nominating
suchet
to
take
his
place
reached
saragossa
after
that
general
had
marched
off
at
the
head
of
his
old
division
of
mortier
s
corps
being
tardy
and
difficult
it
failed
to
catch
him
up
till
he
had
reached
valladolid
returning
from
thence
with
a
escort
of
infantry
suchet
did
not
succeed
in
joining
his
corps
till
may
he
found
it
in
a
desperate
situation
for
the
last
four
weeks
had
seen
an
almost
unbroken
series
of
petty
reverses
and
it
looked
as
if
the
whole
of
aragon
was
about
to
slip
out
of
the
hands
of
the
french
it
was
fortunate
for
the
corps
that
its
new
commander
though
hitherto
he
had
never
been
placed
in
a
position
of
independent
responsibility
proved
to
be
a
man
of
courage
and
resource
perhaps
indeed
the
most
capable
of
all
the
french
generals
who
took
part
in
the
peninsular
war
a
timid
or
unskilful
leader
might
have
lost
aragon
and
imperilled
the
hold
of
king
joseph
on
madrid
it
is
hardly
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
the
entire
french
position
in
spain
would
have
been
gravely
compromised
if
during
the
last
weeks
of
may
the
corps
had
been
under
the
charge
of
a
less
skilful
and
commander
see
see
in
the
month
that
elapsed
before
suchet
s
arrival
the
consequences
of
the
withdrawal
of
the
corps
from
the
lower
ebro
were
making
themselves
felt
the
aragonese
were
not
slow
to
discover
the
decrease
in
the
numbers
of
the
invaders
and
to
note
the
long
distances
that
now
intervened
between
post
and
post
the
partisans
who
had
retired
into
catalonia
or
had
taken
refuge
in
the
mountains
of
the
south
and
the
north
began
to
descend
into
the
plains
and
to
fall
upon
the
outlying
french
detachments
on
may
colonel
perena
came
out
of
lerida
and
beset
the
detachment
of
grandjean
s
division
which
held
the
town
and
fortress
of
monzon
with
a
horde
of
peasants
and
some
catalan
the
governor
solnicki
thereupon
fell
back
to
barbastro
the
head
quarters
of
habert
s
brigade
that
general
considered
that
he
was
in
duty
bound
to
retake
monzon
and
marched
against
it
with
six
battalions
and
a
regiment
of
cuirassiers
he
tried
to
cross
the
cinca
not
opposite
the
town
but
much
lower
down
the
stream
at
the
ferry
of
pomar
may
but
just
as
his
vanguard
had
established
itself
on
the
other
bank
a
sudden
storm
caused
such
a
rising
of
the
waters
that
its
communication
with
the
main
body
was
completely
cut
off
thereupon
habert
marched
northward
and
tried
to
force
a
passage
at
monzon
so
as
to
secure
a
line
of
retreat
for
his
lost
detachment
the
bridge
of
that
town
however
had

the

habert
was
held
at
bay
and
the
men
who
had
crossed
at
the
ferry
of
pomar
were
all
cut
off
and
forced
to
surrender
after
marching
for
three
days
among
the
insurgents
and
vainly
endeavouring
to
force
their
way
through
the
horde
they
had
to
lay
down
their
arms
when
their
cartridges
had
all
been
exhausted
may
only
the
cuirassiers
escaped
by
swimming
the
river
when
the
flood
had
begun
to
abate
and
found
their
way
back
to
barbastro
it
consisted
of
eight
d
viz
the
companies
of
the
line
and
the
of
the
vistula
and
the
grenadier
and
voltigeur
companies
of
the
of
the
line
with
half
a
squadron
of
the
cuirassiers
von

p
in
consequence
of
this
disaster
the
french
lost
their
grip
on
the
valley
of
the
cinca
for
the
insurgents
under
perena
and
the
catalan
chief
baget
moved
forward
into
the
sierra
de
alcubierre
and
raised
the
whole
in
their
aid
habert
fearing
to
be
cut
off
from
saragossa
thereupon
retired
to
villafranca
on
the
ebro
and
abandoned
all
aragon
this
little
campaign
can
be
studied
in
detail
in
von
brandt
pp
he
was
serving
as
lieutenant
in
the
of
the
vistula
and
gives
many
details
which
are
not
to
be
found
in
suchet
or
arteche
toreno
would
seem
ii
to
be
wrong
in
saying
that
habert
tried
to
storm
monzon
and
got
over
the
river
there
but
was
beaten
back
by
baget
von
brandt
says
that
there
was
nothing
but
a
hot
fire
across
the
water
and
that
the
attack
could
not
be
pushed
home
meanwhile
the
other
brigade
of
grandjean
s
division
which
still
lay
at
alcañiz
south
of
the
ebro
was
also
driven
in
by
the
spaniards
its
commander
laval
was
attacked
by
a
large
force
coming
from
tortosa
and
was
forced
to
draw
back
to
san
per
and
hijar
may
at
the
news
of
his
retreat
all
the
of
southern
aragon
took
arms
and
the
bands
from
molina
and
the
other
extended
their
raids
down
the
valley
of
the
huerta
and
almost
to
the
gates
of
saragossa
the
spanish
force
which
had
seized
alcañiz
was
no
mere
body
of
armed
peasants
but
a
small
regular
army
general
blake
had
just
been
given
the
post
of
of
all
the
forces
of
the
the
old
kingdom
of
aragon
and
its
dependencies
valencia
and
catalonia
burning
to
atone
for
his
defeats
at
zornoza
and
espinosa
by
some
brilliant
feat
of
arms
he
was
doing
his
best
to
collect
a
new
army
of
the
from
catalonia
he
could
draw
little
or
nothing
the
troops
which
had
fought
under
reding
at
valls
were
still
cooped
up
in
tarragona
and
unfit
for
but
blake
had
concentrated
at
tortosa
the
division
of
the
marquis
of
lazan
the
sole
surviving
fraction
of
the
old
army
of
aragon
and
the
troops
which
he
could
draw
from
valencia
these
last
consisted
at
this
moment
of
no
more
than
the
reorganized
division
of
roca
from
the
old
army
of
the
its
depleted
had
been
sent
back
by
infantado
from
cuenca
and
the
junta
had
shot
into
them
a
mass
of
recruits
who
in
a
few
weeks
had
raised
the
strength
of
the
division
from
to
bayonets
other
regiments
were
being
raised
in
valencia
but
in
the
early
weeks
of
may
they
were
not
yet
ready
for
the
field
though
by
june
they
gave
blake
a
reinforcement
of
nearly
men
murcia
could
provide
in
may
only
one
single
battalion
for
blake
s
assistance
all
its
field
army
had
perished
at
saragossa
the
total
force
of
the
new
army
of
the
right
when
it
advanced
against
alcañiz
was
less
than
men
the
valencians
in
its
ranks
outnumbered
the
aragonese
by
four
to
three
it
is
necessary
to
enter
a
protest
against
napier
s
statement
vol
ii
that
valencia
did
not
do
its
fair
share
in
defending
the
general
cause
of
spain
that
from
the
very
commencement
of
the
insurrection
its
policy
was
characterized
by
a
singular
indifference
to
the
calamities
that
overwhelmed
the
other
parts
of
the
the
contribution
of
valencia
to
the
national
armies
raised
in
compares
well
with
that
of
the
other
provinces
these
troops
too
were
not
used
for
local
defence
but
employed
in
other
parts
of
spain
argüelles
answer
to
napier
on
this
point
seems
conclusive
see
the
of
his
the
troops
sent
out
by
valencia
were
men
to
join
the
division
of
llamas
in
the
army
of
the

roca
s
later

thirteen
battalions
about
to
join
the

of

two

to

between

total
these
figures
are
exclusive
of
cavalry
and
artillery
and
in
some
cases
are
as
no
of
the
troops
survive
for
the
earlier
months
of
the
campaign
of
and
these
totals
are
taken
from
returns
made
late
in
the
year
when
the
regiments
had
begun
to
run
low
in
numbers
for
the
enormous
monetary
contribution
made
by
valencia
in
see
the
tables
in
argüelles
when
suchet
therefore
arrived
at
saragossa
on
may
and
took
over
the
command
of
the
corps
from
the
hands
of
junot
the
prospect
seemed
a
gloomy
one
for
the
french
their
outlying
detachments
had
been
forced
back
to
the
neighbourhood
of
saragossa
the
central
reserve
musnier
s
two
brigades
was
small
the
third
division
with
the
exception
of
one
regiment
was
still
absent
one
of
its
brigades
was
with
kellermann
in
leon
and
some
detachments
were
scattered
among
the
garrisons
of
navarre
after
the
sick
and
the
absent
had
been
deducted
suchet
found
that
he
had
not
much
more
than
men
under
arms
though
the
nominal
force
of
the
corps
was
still
about
sabres
and
bayonets
nor
was
it
only
in
numbers
that
the
army
of
aragon
was
weak
its
also
left
much
to
be
desired
the
regiments
which
composed
more
than
half
of
the
infantry
were
in
a
deplorable
condition
a
natural
consequence
of
the
haste
with
which
they
had
been
organized
and
sent
into
the
field
having
been
originally
composed
of
companies
drawn
from
many
quarters
they
still
showed
a
mixture
of
uniforms
of
different
cut
and
colour
which
gave
them
a
motley
appearance
and
according
to
their
commander
degraded
them
in
their
own
eyes
and
lowered
their
they
had
not
yet
fully
recovered
from
the
physical
and
moral
strain
of
the
siege
of
saragossa
their
pay
was
in
arrear
the
military
chest
empty
the
food
procured
from
day
to
day
by
marauding
there
was
much
grumbling
among
the
officers
who
complained
that
the
promotions
and
rewards
due
for
the
capture
of
saragossa
had
almost
all
been
reserved
for
the
corps
the
guerrilla
warfare
of
the
last
few
weeks
had
disgusted
the
rank
and
file
who
thought
that
junot
had
been
mismanaging
them
and
knew
absolutely
nothing
of
the
successor
who
had
just
replaced
him
the
whole
corps
says
suchet
was
dejected
and
discontented
see
the
and
of
the
line
were
all
formed
from
the
provisional
regiments
of
suchet

suchet
von
brandt
speaks
to
much
the
same
effect
and
says
that
some
of
the
troops
gave
a
bad
impression
and
that
he
saw
battalions
which
looked
as
if
they
would
not
stand
firm
against
a
sudden
and
fierce
attack
such
as
that
which
mina
and
his
guerrillas
used
to
deliver
nevertheless
there
was
no
time
to
rest
or
reorganize
these
sullen
battalions
the
spaniards
were
pressing
in
so
close
that
it
was
necessary
to
attack
them
at
all
costs
the
only
other
alternative
would
have
been
to
abandon
saragossa
such
a
step
though
perhaps
theoretically
justifiable
under
the
circumstances
would
have
ruined
suchet
s
military
career
and
was
far
from
his
thoughts
only
two
days
after
he
had
assumed
the
command
of
the
corps
he
marched
out
with
musnier
s
division
to
join
laval
s
troops
at
hijar
may
he
had
sent
orders
to
habert
to
cross
the
ebro
and
follow
him
as
fast
as
he
was
able
but
that
general
who
was
still
on
the
march
from
barbastro
to
villafranca
did
not
receive
the
dispatch
in
time
and
failed
to
join
his
chief
before
the
oncoming
battle
from
a
casual
reading
of
suchet
i
it
might
be
thought
that
the
general
had
been
joined
by
habert
before
the
battle
but
he
certainly
was
not
as
the
memoirs
of
von
brandt
who
was
with
habert
show
that
this
brigade
was
at
villafranca
forty
miles
from
alcañiz
on
the
and
only
started
too
late
to
join
its
chief
on
the
the
mention
of
the
of
the
vistula
on
of
suchet
is
a
misprint
for
the
of
the
vistula
of
musnier
s
division
half
the
cuirassiers
was
also
absent
with
habert
on
may
however
suchet
with
musnier
s
and
laval
s
men
presented
himself
in
front
of
blake
s
position
at
alcañiz
he
had
fourteen
battalions
and
five
squadrons
with
him
a
force
in
all
of
about
men
with
eighteen
guns
he
found
the
spaniards
ready
and
willing
to
fight
they
were
drawn
up
on
a
line
of
hills
to
the
east
of
alcañiz
covering
that
town
and
its
bridge
their
position
was
good
from
a
tactical
point
of
view
but
extremely
dangerous
when
considered
strategically
for
blake
had
been
tempted
by
the
strong
ground
into
fighting
with
the
river
guadalope
at
his
back
and
had
no
way
of
crossing
it
save
by
the
single
bridge
of
alcañiz
and
a
bad
ford
it
was
an
exact
reproduction
of
the
deplorable
order
of
battle
that
the
russians
had
adopted
at
friedland
in
though
not
destined
to
lead
to
any
such
disaster
the
northern
and
highest
of
the
three
hills
occupied
by
the
spaniards
that
called
the
cerro

was
held
by
the

placed
the

this

in

the
southern

suchet
seems
to
have
found
some
difficulty
at
first
in
making
out
the
spanish
position
the
hills
hid
from
him
the
bridge
and
town
of
alcañiz
whose
position
in
rear
of
blake
s
centre
was
the
dominant
military
fact
of
the
situation
at
any
rate
he
spent
the
whole
morning
in
tentative
movements
and
only
delivered
his
main
stroke
in
the
afternoon
he
began
by
sending
laval
s
brigade
against
the
dominating
hill
on
the
right
flank
of
the
spanish
position
two
assaults
were
made
upon
the
cerro
de
los
pueyos
which
suchet
in
his
autobiography
calls
feints
but
which
blake
considered
so
serious
that
he
sent
off
to
this
flank
two
battalions
from
his
left
wing
and
the
whole
of
his
cavalry
whether
intended
as
mere
demonstrations
or
as
a
real
attack
these
movements
had
no
success
and
were
repelled
by
general
areizaga
the
commander
of
the
aragonese
without
much
difficulty
the
spanish
cavalry
however
was
badly
mauled
by
suchet
s
hussars
when
it
tried
to
deliver
a
flank
charge
upon
the
enemy
at
the
moment
that
he
retired
when
all
the
fighting
on
the
northern
extremity
of
the
line
had
died
down
suchet
launched
his
main
attack
against
blake
s
centre
hoping
as
he
says
to
break
the
line
seize
the
bridge
of
alcañiz
which
lay
just
behind
the
hill
of
las
horcas
and
thus
to
capture
the
greater
part
of
the
spanish
wings
which
would
have
no
line
of
retreat
the
attack
was
delivered
by
two
of
musnier
s
regiments
formed
in
columns
of
battalions
and
acting
in
a
single
mass
a
force
of
over
men
a
column
of
this
strength
often
succeeded
in
bursting
through
a
spanish
line
during
the
peninsular
war
but
on
this
day
suchet
was
unlucky
or
his
troops
did
not
display
the
usual
of
french
infantry
they
advanced
steadily
enough
across
the
flat
ground
and
began
to
climb
the
hill
in
spite
of
the
rapid
and
accurate
fire
of
the
artillery
which
crowned
its
summit
but
when
the
fire
of
musketry
from
the
spanish
left
began
to
beat
upon
their
flank
and
the
guns
opened
with
grape
the
attacking
columns
came
to
a
standstill
at
the
line
of
a
ditch
cut
in
the
slope
their
officers
made
every
effort
to
carry
them
forward
for
the
few
hundred
yards
that
separated
them
from
the
spanish
guns
but
the
mass
wavered
surged
helplessly
for
a
few
minutes
under
the
heavy
fire
and
then
dispersed
and
fled
in
disorder
suchet
rallied
them
behind
the
five
intact
battalions
which
he
still
possessed
but
refused
to
renew
the
attack
and
drew
off
ere
night
he
himself
had
been
wounded
in
the
foot
at
the
close
of
the
action
and
his
troops
had
suffered
heavily
their
loss
must
have
been
at
least
or
men
blake
who
had
lost
no
more
than
did
not
attempt
to
pursue
fearing
to
expose
his
troops
in
the
plain
to
the
assaults
of
the
french
cavalry
three
battalions
of
the
of
the
line
and
two
of
the
of
the
vistula
suchet
gives
a
very
poor
account
of
alcañiz
in
his
in
spite
of
his
many
merits
he
did
not
take
a
beating
well
and
slurs
over
this
action
just
as
in
he
slurs
over
his
defeat
at
castalla
he
does
not
even
give
an
estimate
of
his
killed
and
wounded
and
has
the
assurance
to
say
that
he
left
the
enemy
only
l
opinion
de
la
victoire
i
blake
clearly
makes
too
much
of
the
french
attack
on
his
right
in
his
dispatch
the
morale
of
the
corps
had
been
so
much
shaken
by
its
unsuccessful
début
under
its
new
commander
that
a
panic
broke
out
after
dark
among
laval
s
troops
who
fled
in
all
directions
on
a
false
alarm
that
the
spanish
cavalry
had
attacked
and
captured
the
rearguard
next
morning
the
army
poured
into
san
per
and
hijar
in
complete
disorder
and
some
hours
had
to
be
spent
in
restoring
discipline
suchet
discovered
the
man
who
had
started
the
cry
of
qui
and
had
him
shot
before
the
day
was
over
suchet
the
french
had
expected
to
be
pursued
and
many
critics
have
blamed
blake
for
not
making
the
most
of
his
victory
and
following
the
defeated
enemy
at
full
speed
the
spanish
general
however
had
good
reasons
for
his
quiescence
he
saw
that
suchet
s
force
was
almost
as
large
as
his
own
he
could
not
match
the
french
in
cavalry
and
having
noted
the
orderly
fashion
in
which
they
had
left
the
he
could
not
have
guessed
that
during
the
night
they
would
disband
in
panic
moreover
and
this
was
the
most
important
point
he
was
expecting
to
receive
in
a
few
days
reinforcements
from
valencia
which
would
more
than
double
his
numbers
till
they
had
come
up
he
would
not
move
but
contented
himself
with
sending
the
news
of
alcañiz
all
over
aragon
and
stimulating
the
activity
of
the
insurgents
as
he
had
hoped
the
results
of
his
victory
were
important
the
french
had
to
evacuate
every
outlying
post
that
they
possessed
and
the
whole
of
the
open
country
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
patriots
perena
and
the
insurgents
of
the
north
bank
of
the
ebro
pressed
close
in
to
saragossa
other
bands
threatened
the
to
tudela
thousands
of
recruits
flocked
into
blake
s
camp
but
he
was
unfortunately
unable
to
arm
or
utilize
them
within
a
few
days
however
he
began
to
receive
the
promised
reinforcements
from
valencia
a
number
of
fresh
regiments
from
the
rear
and
drafts
for
the
corps
that
were
already
with
him
he
also
used
his
authority
as
supreme
commander
in
catalonia
to
draw
some
reinforcements
from
that
principality
three
battalions
of
reding
s
granadan
troops
and
one
of
no
more
could
be
spared
from
in
front
of
the
active
cyr
within
three
weeks
after
his
victory
of
alcañiz
he
had
collected
an
army
of
men
and
considered
himself
strong
enough
to
commence
the
march
upon
saragossa
it
was
in
his
power
to
advance
directly
upon
the
city
by
the
along
the
ebro
and
to
challenge
suchet
to
a
battle
outside
its
southern
gates
he
did
not
however
make
this
move
but
with
a
caution
that
he
did
not
often
display
kept
to
the
mountains
and
marched
by
a
to
belchite
june
here
he
received
news
of
napoleon
s
check
at
essling
which
had
happened
on
the
of
the
preceding
month
it
was
announced
as
a
complete
and
crushing
defeat
of
the
emperor
and
encouraged
the
spaniards
in
no
small
degree
the
drafts
were
so
large
that
the
troops
of
lazan
s
division
which
had
numbered
in
may
were
in
june
those
of
roca
rose
similarly
from
to
the
valencian
junta
claimed
to
have
sent
in
all
men
to
reinforce
blake
and
the
returns
bear
them
out
they
also
gave
him
reals
in
cash
about
raised
by
a
special
contribution
in
fifteen
days
their
report
says
that
they
had
sent
on
every
armed
man
in
the
province
and
that
the
city
was
only
guarded
by
peasants
armed
with
pikes
argüelles
from
belchite
blake
still
keeping
to
the
mountains
pursued
his
march
eastward
to
villanueva
in
the
valley
of
the
huerba
this
move
revealed
his
design
he
was
about
to
place
himself
in
a
position
from
which
he
could
threaten
suchet
s
lines
of
communication
with
tudela
and
logroño
and
so
compel
him
either
to
abandon
saragossa
without
fighting
or
to
come
out
and
attack
the
spanish
army
among
the
hills
blake
in
short
was
trying
to
manœuvre
his
enemy
out
of
saragossa
or
to
induce
him
to
fight
another
offensive
action
such
as
that
of
alcañiz
had
been
after
the
experience
of
may
he
thought
that
he
could
trust
his
army
to
hold
its
ground
though
he
was
not
willing
to
risk
an
advance
in
the
open
across
the
level
plain
in
front
of
saragossa
suchet
meanwhile
had
concentrated
his
whole
available
force
in
that
city
and
its
immediate
neighbourhood
he
had
drawn
in
every
man
save
a
single
column
of
two
battalions
which
was
lying
at
la
muela
under
general
fabre
with
orders
to
keep
back
the
insurgents
of
the
southern
mountains
from
making
a
dash
at
alagon
and
cutting
the
to
tudela
he
had
been
writing
letters
to
madrid
couched
in
the
most
urgent
terms
to
beg
for
reinforcements
but
just
at
this
moment
the
asturian
expedition
had
drawn
away
to
the
north
all
the
troops
in
old
castile
king
joseph
could
do
no
more
than
promise
that
the
two
regiments
from
the
corps
which
had
been
lent
to
kellermann
should
be
summoned
back
and
directed
to
make
forced
marches
on
saragossa
he
could
spare
nothing
save
these
six
battalions
believing
it
impossible
to
deplete
the
garrison
of
madrid
or
to
draw
from
valladolid
the
single
division
of
mortier
s
corps
which
was
at
this
moment
the
only
solid
force
remaining
in
the
valley
of
the
douro
suchet
was
inclined
to
believe
that
he
might
be
attacked
before
this
small
reinforcement
of
men
could
arrive
and
feared
that
with
little
more
than
sabres
and
bayonets
he
would
risk
defeat
if
he
attacked
blake
in
the
mountains
the
conduct
of
his
troops
in
and
after
the
battle
of
alcañiz
had
not
tended
to
make
him
hopeful
of
the
result
of
another
action
of
the
same
kind
nevertheless
when
blake
came
down
into
the
valley
of
the
huerba
and
began
to
threaten
his
communications
he
resolved
that
he
must
fight
once
again
the
alternative
course
the
evacuation
of
saragossa
and
a
retreat
up
the
ebro
would
have
been
too
humiliating
suchet
devoted
the
three
weeks
of
respite
which
the
slow
advance
of
the
enemy
allowed
him
to
the
reorganization
of
his
corps
he
made
strenuous
exertions
to
clothe
it
and
to
provide
it
with
its
arrears
of
pay
he
inspected
every
regiment
in
person
sought
out
and
remedied
grievances
displaced
a
number
of
unsatisfactory
officers
and
promoted
many
deserving
individuals
he
claims
that
the
improvement
in
the
morale
of
the
troops
during
the
three
weeks
when
they
lay
encamped
at
saragossa
was
enormous
and
his
statements
may
be
verified
in
the
narrative
of
one
of
his
subordinates
who
remarks
that
neither
moncey
nor
junot
had
ever
shown
that
keen
personal
interest
in
the
corps
which
suchet
always
displayed
and
that
the
troops
considered
their
new
chief
both
more
genial
and
more
than
any
general
they
had
hitherto
seen
and
so
resolved
to
do
their
best
for
him
suchet
von

i
forced
to
fight
but
not
by
any
means
confident
of
victory
the
french
commander
discharged
on
to
tudela
and
pampeluna
his
sick
his
heavy
baggage
and
his
parks
before
marching
out
to
meet
blake
upon
june
the
enemy
though
still
clinging
to
the
skirts
of
the
hills
had
now
moved
so
close
to
saragossa
that
it
was
clear
that
he
must
be
attacked
at
once
though
suchet
would
have
preferred
to
wait
a
few
days
longer
till
he
should
have
rallied
the
brigade
from
old
castile
these
two
regiments
under
colonel
robert
had
now
passed
tudela
and
were
expected
to
arrive
on
the
fifteenth
or
sixteenth
but
blake
had
now
descended
the
valley
of
the
huerba
and
had
pushed
his
outposts
to
within
ten
or
twelve
miles
of
saragossa
he
had
reorganized
his
army
into
three
divisions
one
of
which
mainly
composed
of
aragonese
troops
was
placed
under
general
areizaga
while
roca
and
the
marquis
of
lazan
headed
the
two
others
in
which
the
valencian
levies
predominated
of
the
total
of
men
which
the
showed
were
in
line
the
rest
were
detached
or
in
hospital
there
were
about
untrustworthy
cavalry
and
guns
in
his
final
advance
down
the
huerba
blake
moved
in
two
columns
areizaga
s
division
kept
to
the
right
bank
and
halted
at
botorrita
some
sixteen
miles
from
saragossa
the
with
the
other
two
divisions
marched
on
the
left
bank
and
pushing
further
forward
than
his
lieutenant
reached
the
village
of
maria
twelve
miles
from
the
front
of
the
city
a
distance
of
six
or
seven
miles
separated
the
two
corps
thus
blake
had
taken
the
strategical
offensive
but
was
endeavouring
to
retain
the
tactical
defensive
by
placing
himself
in
a
position
where
the
enemy
must
attack
him
but
he
seems
to
have
made
a
grave
mistake
in
keeping
his
columns
so
far
apart
on
different
roads
and
with
a
river
between
them
it
should
have
been
his
object
to
make
sure
that
every
man
was
on
the
field
when
the
critical
moment
should
arrive
already
on
the
morning
of
the
fourteenth
the
two
armies
came
into
contact
musnier
s
division
met
the
spanish
vanguard
thrust
it
back
some
way
but
then
came
upon
blake
and
the
main
body
and
had
to
give
ground
suchet
on
the
same
evening
established
his
head
quarters
at
the
abbey
of
santa
fé
and
there
dictated
his
orders
for
the
battle
of
the
following
day
having
ascertained
that
areizaga
s
division
was
the
weaker
of
the
two
spanish
columns
he
left
opposite
it
on
the
monte
torrero
a
mile
and
a
half
outside
saragossa
only
a
single
brigade
five
battalions
under
general
laval
who
had
now
become
the
commander
of
the
division
for
grandjean
had
been
sent
back
to
france
protected
by
the
line
of
the
canal
of
aragon
these
men
were
to
do
their
best
to
beat
off
any
attack
which
areizaga
might
make
against
the
city
while
the
main
bodies
of
both
armies
were
engaged
elsewhere
the
charge
of
saragossa
itself
was
given
over
to
colonel
haxo
who
had
but
a
single
battalion
of
infantry
and
the
of
the
army
of
the
line
bayonets
and
of
the
vistula
bayonets
according
to
suchet
s
figures
apparently
a
battalion
of
the
of
the
line
the
rest
of
which
regiment
was
still
in
navarre
having
set
aside
these
men
to
guard
his
flank
and
rear
suchet
could
only
bring
forward
musnier
s
division
and
the
remaining
brigade
of
laval
s
division
that
of
habert
with
two
other
battalions
for
the
main
attack
but
he
retained
with
himself
the
whole
of
his
cavalry
and
all
his
artillery
save
one
single
battery
left
with
the
troops
on
monte
torrero
this
gave
him
fourteen
battalions
about
infantry
horse
and
twelve
guns
less
than
men
in
all
to
commence
the
battle
but
he
was
encouraged
to
risk
an
attack
by
the
news
that
the
brigade
from
tudela
was
now
close
at
hand
and
could
reach
the
field
by
noon
with
bayonets

it
would
seem

he
does
not

two
other
similar

were
in

the
french
occupied

a

out

either
to

of

which
suchet
had
brought
from
valladolid
as
his
personal
escort
and
which
properly
belonged
to
the
corps
blake
s
army
was
slow
in
taking
up
its
ground
while
suchet
did
not
wish
to
move
till
the
brigade
from
tudela
had
got
within
supporting
distance
hence
in
the
morning
hours
there
was
no
serious
collision
but
at
last
the
spaniards
took
the
initiative
and
pushed
a
cautious
advance
against
suchet
s
left
apparently
with
the
object
of
worrying
him
into
assuming
the
offensive
rather
than
of
delivering
a
serious
attack
but
the
cloud
of
skirmishers
sent
against
habert
s
front
grew
so
thick
and
pushed
so
far
forward
that
at
last
the
whole
brigade
was
seriously
engaged
and
the
artillery
was
obliged
to
open
upon
the
swarm
of
spanish
they
fell
back
when
the
shells
began
to
drop
among
them
and
sought
refuge
by
retiring
nearer
to
their
main
body
suchet
says
the
morning
was
occupied
in
mere
tiraillement
of
the
spanish
skirmishers
and
the
of
the
vistula
this
is
not
borne
out
by
the
narrative
of
von
brandt
of
that
corps
he
says
that
the
enemy
came
on
sehr
lebhaft
that
both
battalions
of
his
regiment
were
deeply
engaged
that
a
regiment
of
spanish
dragoons
in
yellow

calls
it
numancia
but
it
was
really

charged
into
the
and
nearly
broke
it
the
of

all
its

the
spaniards
were
only
driven
off
by
a
battery
being
drawn
forward
into

then
the
fight
stood
still
but
the
regiment
had
suffered
very
heavily
and
was
finally
drawn
back

about
midday
the
bickering
died
down
on
the
french
left
but
shortly
after
the
fire
broke
out
with
redoubled
energy
in
another
direction
disappointed
that
he
could
not
induce
suchet
to
attack
him
blake
had
at
last
resolved
to
take
the
offensive
himself
and
columns
were
seen
descending
from
his
extreme
left
wing
evidently
with
the
intention
of
turning
the
french
right
having
thus
made
up
his
mind
to
strike
the
spanish
general
should
have
sent
prompt
orders
to
his
detached
division
under
areizaga
to
bid
it
cross
the
huerba
with
all
possible
speed
and
hasten
to
join
the
main
body
before
the
engagement
had
grown
hot
it
could
certainly
have
arrived
in
two
hours
since
it
was
but
six
or
seven
miles
away
but
blake
made
no
attempt
to
call
in
this
body
of
men
the
best
troops
in
his
army
or
to
utilize
it
in
any
way
he
only
employed
the
two
divisions
that
were
under
his
hand
on
the
hillsides
above
maria
the
attack
on
the
french
right
made
between
one
and
two
o
clock
precipitated
matters
when
suchet
saw
the
spanish
battalions
beginning
to
descend
from
the
ridge
he
ordered
his
polish
lancers
to
charge
them
in
flank
and
attacked
them
in
front
with
part
of
the
regiment
and
some
companies
the
enemy
was
thrown
back
and
retired
to
rejoin
his
main
body
then
before
they
were
fully
rearranged
in
line
of
battle
the
french
general
bade
the
whole
of
musnier
s
division
advance
and
storm
the
spanish
position
he
was
emboldened
to
press
matters
to
an
issue
by
the
joyful
news
that
the

before

was
over
suchet
learnt
that
robert
and
his
brigade
had
arrived
at
the
abbey
of
santa
fé
on
his
right
rear
he
therefore
resolved
to
throw
into
the
battle
the
wing
of
his
army
which
he
had
hitherto
held
back
habert
s
battalions
and
the
cavalry
when
the
storm
had
passed
over
they
advanced
against
the
spanish
right
in
the
low
ground
near
the
river
the
three
battalions
of
infantry
led
the
way
but
when
their
fire
had
begun
to
take
effect
suchet
bade
his
hussars
and
cuirassiers
charge
through
the
intervals
of
the
front
line
the
troops
here
opposed
to
them
consisted
of
cavalry
under
general
o
donoju
the
whole
of
the
horsemen
that
blake
possessed
for
the
rest
of
his
squadrons
were
with
areizaga
far
away
from
the
field
the
of
the
vistula
having
been
distracted
to
the
centre
habert
had
only
the
two
battalions
of
the
of
the
line
and
one
of
the
léger
from
the
reserve
the
charge
of
wathier
s
two
regiments
proved
decisive
the
spanish
horse
did
not
wait
to
cross
sabres
but
broke
and
fled
from
the
field
exposing
the
flank
of
the
battalions
which
lay
next
them
in
the
line
the
cuirassiers
and
hussars
rolled
up
these
unfortunate
troops
and
hunted
them
along
the
as
far
as
the
outskirts
of
maria
here
they
came
upon
and
rode
down
the
two
battalions
which
blake
had
left
there
as
a
last
reserve
and
captured
the
that
accompanied
them
the
spanish
right
was
annihilated
and
what
was
worse
blake
had
lost
possession
of
the
only
road
by
which
he
could
withdraw
and
join
areizaga
meanwhile
habert
s
battalions
had
not
followed
the
cavalry
in
their
charge
but
had
turned
upon
the
exposed
flank
of
the
spanish
centre
and
were
attacking
it
in
side
and
rear
it
is
greatly
to
blake
s
credit
that
his
firmness
did
not
give
way
in
this
distressing
moment
he
threw
back
his
right
and
sent
up
into
line
such
of
lazan
s
battalions
from
his
rear
line
as
had
not
yet
been
drawn
into
the
fight
thus
he
saved
himself
from
utter
disaster
and
though
losing
ground
all
through
the
evening
hours
kept
his
men
together
and
finally
left
the
field
in
a
solid
mass
retiring
over
the
hills
and
ravines
to
the
southward
the
spaniards
wrote
an
went
off
the
field
in
perfect
order
and
with
a
good
military
bearing
but
they
had
been
forced
to
leave
behind
them
all
their
guns
save
two
for
they
had
no
road
and
could
not
drag
the
artillery
up
the
rugged
slopes
by
which
they
saved
themselves
blake
also
lost
killed
three
or
four
times
that
number
of
wounded
and
some
hundreds
of
prisoners
the
steadiness
of
the
retreat
is
vouched
for
by
the
small
number
of
flags
captured
by
the
french
only
three
out
of
the
that
had
been
upon
the
field
suchet
according
to
his
own
account
had
lost
no
more
than
between
and
men

when
safe
from
pursuit
the
beaten
army
crossed
the
huerba
far
above

and
rejoined
areizaga
s
division
at
botorrita
on
the
right
bank
of
that
stream
next
morning
to
his
surprise
suchet
learnt
that
the
enemy
was
still
in
position
at
botorrita
and
was
showing
a
steady
front
the
victor
did
not
march
directly
against
blake
as
might
have
been
expected
but
ordered
laval
with
the
troops
that
had
been
guarding
saragossa
to
turn
the
spaniards
right
while
he
himself
manœuvred
to
get
round
their
left
these
cautious
proceedings
would
seem
to
indicate
that
the
french
army
had
been
more
exhausted
by
the
battle
of
the
previous
day
than
suchet
concedes
the
turning
movements
failed
and
blake
drew
off
undisturbed
at
nightfall
and
retired
on
that
same
road
to
belchite
by
which
he
had
marched
on
saragossa
in
such
high
hopes
only
four
days
back
the
battle
of
maria
had
been
on
the
whole
very
creditable
to
the
valencian
troops
but
the
subsequent
course
of
events
was
lamentable
on
the
way
to
belchite
many
of
the
raw
levies
began
to
disband
themselves
the
weather
was
bad
the
road
worse
and
the
consciousness
of
defeat
had
had
time
enough
to
sink
into
the
minds
of
the
soldiery
when
blake
halted
at
belchite
he
found
that
he
had
only
men
with
him
deducting
the
losses
of
the
fifteenth
there
should
have
been
at
least
in
line
of
artillery
he
possessed
no
more
than
nine
guns
seven
that
had
been
with
areizaga
and
two
saved
from
maria
suchet
i
says
that
blake
had
been
reinforced
by
valencians
when
he
fought
at
belchite
this
seems
to
have
been
an
error
his
reinforcement
being
areizaga
s
men
picked
up
at
botorrita
who
were
all
aragonese
it
can
only
be
considered
therefore
a
piece
of
mad
presumption
on
the
part
of
the
spanish
general
that
he
halted
at
belchite
and
again
offered
battle
to
his
pursuers
the
position
in
front
of
that
town
was
strong
far
stronger
than
the
ground
at
maria
but
the
men
were
not
the
same
on
june
they
had
fought
with
confidence
proud
of
their
victory
at
alcañiz
and
intending
to
enter
saragossa
in
triumph
next
day
on
june
they
were
cowed
and
disheartened
they
had
already
done
their
best
and
had
failed
it
seemed
to
them
hopeless
to
try
the
fortunes
of
war
again
and
they
were
half
beaten
before
a
shot
had
been
fired
the
mere
numerical
odds
too
were
no
longer
in
their
favour
at
maria
blake
had
men
to
suchet
s
if
we
count
only
the
troops
that
fought
and
neglect
the
french
who
came
up
late
in
the
day
and
were
never
engaged
at
belchite
blake
had
about
men
and
suchet
rather
more
for
he
had
gathered
in
laval
s
and
robert
s
brigades
full
bayonets
and
could
put
into
line
men
even
if
allowance
be
made
for
his
losses
in
the
late
battle
it
is
impossible
to
understand
the
temerity
with
which
the
spanish
general
courted
a
disaster
by
resolving
to
fight
a
second
battle
only
three
days
after
he
had
lost
the
first
he
had
battalions
and
eight
squadrons
at
belchite
as
he
says
himself
while
at
maria
he
had
only
fourteen
battalions
and
seven
squadrons
blake
s
centre
was
in
front
of
belchite
in
comparatively
ground
much
cut
up
by
olive
groves
and
enclosures
his
wings
were
drawn
up
on
two
gentle
hills
called
the
calvary
and
el
pueyo
the
left
was
the
weaker
flank
the
ridge
there
being
open
and
exposed
it
was
on
this
wing
therefore
that
suchet
directed
his
main
effort
he
sent
against
it
the
whole
of
musnier
s
division
and
a
regiment
of
cavalry
while
habert
s
brigade
marched
to
turn
the
right
the
centre
was
left
unattacked
the
moment
that
musnier
s
attack
was
well
pronounced
the
whole
of
the
spanish
left
wing
gave
way
and
fell
back
on
belchite
to
cover
itself
behind
the
walls
and
before
the
french
division
could
be
for
a
second
attack
an
even
more
disgraceful
rout
occurred
on
the
right
wing
habert
s
brigade
had
just
commenced
to
close
in
upon
the
spaniards
when
a
chance
shell
exploded
a
caisson
in
rear
of
the
battery
in
blake
s
the
fire
communicated
itself
to
the
other
which
were
standing
near
and
the
whole
group
blew
up
with
a
terrific
report
this
piece
of
luck
threw
the
whole
line
into
panic
writes
an
the
enemy
thought
that
he
was
attacked
in
the
rear
every
man
shouted
treason
whole
battalions
threw
down
their
arms
and
bolted
the
disorder
spread
along
the
entire
line
and
we
only
had
to
run
in
upon
them
and
seize
what
we
could
if
they
had
not
closed
the
which
we
found
it
difficult
to
batter
in
i
fancy
that
the
whole
spanish
army
would
have
been
captured
or
cut
to
pieces
but
it
took
some
time
to
break
down
the
narrow
grated
door
and
then
a
battalion
stood
at
bay
in
the
market
place
and
had
to
be
ridden
down
by
our
polish
lancers
before
we
could
get
on
lastly
we
had
to
pass
through
another
gate
to
make
our
exit
and
to
cross
the
bridge
over
the
aguas
in
a
narrow
formation
this
gave
the
spaniards
time
to
show
a
clean
pair
of
heels
and
they
utilized
the
chance
with
their
constitutional
agility
we
took
few
prisoners
but
got
their
nine
guns
some
twenty
munition
wagons
and
the
whole
of
their
very
considerable
magazines
general
suchet
wrote
up
a
splendid
account
of
the
elaborate
manœuvres
that
he
made
but
i
believe
that
my
tale
is
nearer
to
the
facts
and
that
the
order
of
battle
which
he
published
was
composed
the
whole
affair
did
not
last
long
enough
for
him
to
carry
out
the
various
dispositions
which
he
details
certainly
on
reading
suchet
s
report
one
would
not
be
inclined
to
think
that
the
whole
matter
was
such
a
disgraceful
rout
as
von
brandt
i
describes
in
the
above
paragraphs
the
whole
spanish
army
was
scattered
to
the
winds
it
was
some
days
before
the
aragonese
and
catalans
began
to
rally
at
tortosa
and
the
valencians
at
morella
the
total
loss
in
the
battle
had
not
been
large
suchet
says
that
only
one
regiment
was
actually
surrounded
and
cut
to
pieces
and
only
one
flag
taken
but
of
the
men
who
had
formed
the
army
of
the
right
on
june
not
were
available
a
month
later
and
these
were
in
a
state
of
demoralization
which
would
have
made
it
impossible
to
take
them
into
action
suchet
was
therefore
able
to
set
himself
at
leisure
to
the
task
of
reducing
the
plains
of
aragon
whose
control
had
passed
out
of
his
hands
in
may
he
left
musnier
s
division
at
alcañiz
to
watch
all
that
was
left
of
blake
s
army
while
he
marched
with
the
other
two
to
overrun
the
central
valley
of
the
ebro
on
june
he
seized
caspe
and
its
long
wooden
bridge
and
crossed
the
river
next
he
occupied
fraga
and
monzon
and
left
habert
and
the
division
to
watch
the
valley
of
the
cinca
with
the
remaining
division
that
of
laval
he
marched
back
to
saragossa
july
sweeping
the
open
country
clear
of
guerrilla
bands
then
he
sat
down
for
a
space
in
the
aragonese
capital
to
busy
himself
in
administrative
schemes
for
the
governance
of
the
kingdom
and
in
preparation
for
a
systematic
campaign
against
the
numerous
insurgents
of
the
northern
and
southern
mountains
who
still
remained
under
arms
and
seemed
to
have
been
little
affected
by
the
disasters
of
maria
and
belchite
morlot
s
division
had
been
handed
over
to
habert
who
resigned
his
brigade
of
laval
s
division
to
the
polish
colonel
chlopicki
thus
ended
blake
s
invasion
of
aragon
an
undertaking
which
promised
well
from
the
day
of
alcañiz
down
to
the
battle
of
june
it
miscarried
mainly
through
the
gross
tactical
error
which
the
general
made
in
dividing
his
army
and
fighting
at
maria
with
only
of
his
available
force
his
strategy
down
to
the
actual
moment
of
battle
seems
to
have
been
and
prudent
if
he
had
put
the
aragonese
division
of
areizaga
in
line
between
the
river
and
the
hill
instead
of
his
handful
of
untrustworthy
cavalry
it
seems
likely
that
a
second
alcañiz
might
have
been
fought
on
the
fatal
fifteenth
of
june
for
suchet
s
infantry
attack
had
miscarried
and
it
was
only
the
onslaught
of
his
cavalry
that
won
the
day
had
that
charge
failed
saragossa
must
have
been
evacuated
that
night
and
the
corps
would
have
been
forced
back
on
navarre
to
the
entire
dislocation
of
all
other
french
operations
in
spain
if
king
joseph
had
received
the
news
of
the
loss
of
aragon
in
the
same
week
in
which
he
learnt
that
soult
and
ney
had
evacuated
galicia
and
kellermann
the
asturias
he
would
probably
have
called
back
victor
and
sebastiani
and
abandoned
madrid
for
a
disaster
in
the
valley
of
the
douro
or
the
ebro
as
napoleon
once
observed
is
the
most
fatal
blow
of
all
to
an
invader
based
on
the
north
and
makes
central
spain
untenable
while
wondering
at
blake
s
errors
we
must
not
forget
to
lay
part
of
the
blame
at
the
door
of
his
lieutenant
areizaga
the
incapable
man
who
afterwards
lost
the
fatal
fight
of
ocaña
an
officer
of
sound
views
when
left
without
orders
would
have
marched
to
the
cannon
and
appeared
on
the
field
of
maria
in
the
afternoon
areizaga
sat
quiescent
six
miles
from
the
while
the
cannon
were
thundering
in
his
ears
from
eleven
in
the
morning
till
six
in
the
afternoon
as
for
suchet
we
see
that
he
took
a
terrible
risk
and
came
safely
through
the
ordeal
there
were
many
reasons
for
evacuating
saragossa
when
blake
came
down
the
valley
of
the
huerba
to
cut
the
communications
of
the
corps
but
an
enterprising
general
just
making
his
début
in
independent
command
could
not
well
take
the
responsibility
of
retreat
without
first
trying
the
luck
of
battle
fortune
favoured
the
brave
and
a
splendid
victory
saved
saragossa
and
led
to
the
reconquest
of
the
lost
plains
of
aragon
yet
with
another
cast
of
the
dice
maria
might
have
proved
a
defeat
and
suchet
have
gone
down
to
history
as
a
rash
officer
who
imperilled
the
whole
fate
of

lisbon
yet
these
uncovenanted
mercies
did
not
distract
him
from
his
original
plan
his
main
object
was
not
the
destruction
of
soult
but
the
clearing
of
the
whole
frontier
of
portugal
from
the
danger
of
invasion
and
this
could
not
be
accomplished
till
victor
had
been
dealt
with
the
necessity
for
a
prompt
movement
against
the
corps
was
emphasized
by
the
news
received
on
may
at
montalegre
that
its
commander
was
already
astir
and
apparently
about
to
assume
the
offensive
mackenzie
reported
from
abrantes
with
some
signs
of
dismay
that
a
strong
french
column
had
just
fallen
upon
alcantara
and
driven
from
it
the
small
portuguese
detachment
which
was
covering
his
front
see
accordingly
wellesley
turned
the
march
of
his
whole
army
southward
the
very
moment
that
he
discovered
that
the
corps
had
not
fallen
into
the
trap
set
for
it
at
chaves
and
ruivaens
he
had
resolved
to
leave
nothing
but
the
local
levies
of
silveira
and
botilho
to
watch
galicia
and
to
protect
the
provinces
north
of
the
douro
soult
he
wrote
will
be
very
little
formidable
to
any
body
of
troops
for
some
time
to
he
imagined
and
quite
correctly
that
the
galician
guerrillas
and
the
army
of
la
romana
would
suffice
to
find
him
occupation
he
did
not
however
realize
that
it
was
possible
that
not
only
soult
but
ney
also
would
be
so
much
harassed
by
the
insurgents
and
would
fall
into
such
bitter
strife
with
each
other
that
they
might
ere
long
evacuate
galicia
altogether
this
indeed
could
not
have
been
foreseen
at
the
moment
when
the
british
turned
southwards
from
montalegre
if
wellesley
could
have
guessed
that
by
july
the
three
french
corps
in
northern
spain
the
and
would
all
be
clear
of
the
mountains
and
concentrated
in
the
triangle
he
would
have
had
to
recast
his
plan
of
operations
but
on
may
such
a
conjunction
appeared
most
improbable
and
the
british
general
could
not
have
deemed
it
likely
that
a
french
army
of
men
available
for
would
be
collected
on
the
central
douro
at
the
moment
when
he
had
committed
himself
to
operations
on
the
tagus
indeed
for
some
weeks
after
he
had
departed
from
oporto
the
information
from
the
north
made
any
such
concentration
appear
improbable
while
he
was
on
his
march
to
the
south
he
began
to
hear
of
the
details
of
ney
s
and
kellermann
s
expedition
against
the
asturias
news
which
he
received
with
complacency
as
it
showed
that
the
french
were
entangling
themselves
in
new
and
hazardous
enterprises
which
would
make
it
more
difficult
than
ever
for
them
to
collect
a
force
opposite
the
frontier
of
northern
portugal
down
to
the
very
end
of
june
wellesley
had
no
reason
to
dread
any
concentration
of
french
troops
upon
his
flank
in
the
valley
of
the
douro
it
was
only
in
the
following
month
that
soult
was
heard
of
at
puebla
de
senabria
and
ney
at
astorga
by
that
time
the
british
army
had
already
crossed
the
frontier
of
spain
and
commenced
its
operations
against
victor
see
the
letter
to
colonel
bourke
iv
at
the
moment
when
wellesley
turned
back
from
montalegre
and
set
his
face
southward
he
had
not
yet
settled
the
details
of
his
plan
of
campaign
there
appeared
to
be
two
courses
open
to
him
the
first
was
to
base
himself
upon
almeida
and
ciudad
rodrigo
and
advance
upon
salamanca
this
movement
which
he
could
have
begun
in
the
second
week
of
june
would
undoubtedly
have
thrown
into
disorder
all
the
french
arrangements
in
northern
spain
there
would
have
been
no
force
ready
to
oppose
him
save
a
single
division
of
mortier
s
corps
the
rest
of
that
marshal
s
troops
were
absent
with
kellermann
in
the
asturias
this
could
not
have
held
the
british
army
back
and
a
bold
march
in
advance
would
have
placed
wellesley
in
a
position
where
he
could
have
intercepted
all
communications
between
the
french
troops
in
galicia
and
those
in
and
about
madrid
the
movement
might
appear
tempting
but
it
would
have
been
too
hazardous
the
only
force
that
could
have
been
used
for
it
was
the
troops
of
wellesley
s
own
army
backed
by
the
or
portuguese
regulars
whom
beresford
could
collect
between
the
douro
and
the
tagus
the
spaniards
had
no
troops
in
this
direction
save
the
garrison
of
ciudad
rodrigo
and
a
battalion
or
two
which
carlos
d
españa
had
raised
on
the
borders
of
leon
and
portugal
on
the
other
hand
the
news
that
the
british
were
at
salamanca
or
toro
would
certainly
have
forced
ney
soult
and
kellermann
to
evacuate
galicia
and
the
asturias
and
hasten
to
the
aid
of
mortier
they
would
have
been
far
too
strong
when
united
for
the
or
men
of
wellesley
and
beresford
la
romana
and
the
asturians
could
have
brought
no
corresponding
reinforcements
to
assist
the
british
army
and
must
necessarily
have
arrived
too
late
long
after
the
french
corps
would
have
reached
the
douro
the
idea
of
a
movement
on
salamanca
therefore
did
not
even
for
a
moment
enter
into
wellesley
s
mind
napier
ii
calls
this
alternative
plan
of
campaign
a
movement
in
conjunction
with
beresford
del
parque
and
romana
by
this
is
a
most
inappropriate
description
of
it
about
june
when
operations
might
have
commenced
del
parque
s
army
did
not
yet
exist
there
were
only
three
or
four
of
carlos
d
españa
s
battalions
at
or
near
rodrigo
la
romana
on
the
other
hand
was
at
orense
facing
soult
and
could
not
have
reached
almeida
or
rodrigo
for
weeks
after
the
campaign
would
have
begun
the
other
alternative
open
to
the
british
general
and
that
which
he
had
from
the
first
determined
to
take
in
hand
was
as
we
have
already
seen
a
march
against
victor
such
a
movement
might
be
carried
out
in
one
of
two
ways
it
would
be
possible
to
advance
against
his
flank
and
rear
by
keeping
north
of
the
tagus
and
striking
by
coria
and
plasencia
at
almaraz
and
its
great
bridge
of
boats
across
which
ran
the
communication
between
the
corps
and
madrid
this
operation
would
have
to
be
carried
out
by
the
british
army
alone
while
the
spanish
army
of
estremadura
acting
from
a
separate
base
kept
in
touch
with
victor
but
avoided
compromising
itself
by
any
rash
attack
upon
him
the
marshal
placed
in
a
central
position
between
wellesley
s
and
cuesta
s
forces
would
certainly
try
to
beat
one
of
them
before
they
got
the
chance
of
drawing
together
it
was
equally
possible
to
operate
against
victor
not
on
separate
lines
but
by
crossing
the
tagus
joining
the
spaniards
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
of
badajoz
and
falling
upon
the
marshal
with
the
united
strength
of
both
armies
this
movement
would
be
less
hazardous
than
the
other
since
it
would
secure
the
concentration
of
an
army
of
a
strength
sufficient
to
crush
the
men
at
which
the
corps
might
reasonably
be
rated
but
it
would
only
drive
victor
back
upon
madrid
and
king
joseph
s
reserves
by
a
frontal
attack
while
the
other
plan
that
of
the
march
on
almaraz
would
imperil
his
flank
and
rear
and
threaten
to
cut
him
off
from
the
king
and
the
capital
before
making
any
decision
between
the
two
plans
wellesley
wrote
to
cuesta
from
oporto
on
may
a
letter
requesting
him
to
state
his
views
as
to
the
way
in
which
the
operations
of
the
british
and
spanish
armies
could
best
be
combined
he
informed
him
that
the
troops
which
had
defeated
soult
were
already
on
their
way
to
the
south
that
the
head
of
the
column
would
reach
the
mondego
on
the
and
that
the
whole
would
be
concentrated
near
abrantes
early
in
june
it
was
at
that
place
that
the
choice
would
have
to
be
made
between
the
two
possible
lines
of
attack
on
victor
that
which
led
to
almaraz
and
that
which
went
on
to
southern
estremadura
a
few
days
later
wellesley
dispatched
a
confidential
officer
of
his
staff
colonel
bourke
to
bear
to
the
spanish
general
a
definite
request
for
his
decision
on
the
point
whether
the
allied
armies
should
prepare
for
an
actual
junction
or
should
manœuvre
from
separate
bases
or
should
with
communication
combine
their
movements
without
adopting
a
single
base
or
a
joint
line
of
advance
bourke
was
also
directed
to
obtain
all
the
information
that
he
could
concerning
the
strength
morale
and
discipline
of
cuesta
s
army
and
to
discover
what
chance
there
was
of
securing
the
active
assistance
of
the
second
spanish
army
in
the
south
that
which
under
general
venegas
was
defending
the
defiles
in
front
of
la
carolina
see
the
memorandum
for
bourke
in
iv
it
was
clear
that
some
days
must
elapse
before
an
answer
could
arrive
from
the
camp
of
the
estremaduran
army
and
meanwhile
wellesley
continued
to
urge
the
of
his
troops
from
the
various
points
at
which
they
had
halted
between
oporto
and
montalegre
all
the
scattered
british
brigades
were
directed
on
abrantes
by
different
routes
those
which
had
the
least
distance
to
march
began
to
arrive
there
on
the
eleventh
and
the
twelve
of
june
the
had
resolved
not
to
take
on
with
him
the
portuguese
regulars
whom
he
had
employed
in
the
campaign
against
soult
both
the
brigades
which
had
marched
on
amarante
under
beresford
and
the
four
battalions
which
had
fought
along
with
wellesley
in
the
main
column
were
now
dropped
behind
they
were
destined
to
form
an
army
of
observation
lest
mortier
and
his
corps
or
any
other
french
force
might
chance
to
assail
the
front
between
the
douro
and
the
tagus
during
the
absence
of
the
british
in
the
south
beresford
who
was
left
in
command
was
directed
to
arrange
his
troops
so
as
to
be
able
to
support
almeida
and
resist
any
raid
from
the
direction
of
salamanca
or
zamora
the
main
body
of
the
army
lay
at
guarda
its
reserves
at
coimbra
the
portuguese
division
which
had
been
lying
on
the
zezere
in
company
with
mackenzie
s
troops
was
also
placed
at
beresford
s
disposition
so
that
he
had
about
eighteen
battalions
four
regiments
of
cavalry
and
five
or
six
batteries
a
force
of
between
and
men
it
was
his
duty
to
connect
wellesley
s
left
wing
with
silveira
s
right
and
to
reinforce
either
of
them
if
necessary
the
was
inclined
to
believe
from
his
knowledge
of
the
disposition
of
the
french
corps
at
the
moment
that
no
very
serious
attack
was
likely
to
be
directed
against
northern
portugal
during
his
absence
at
the
most
soult
might
threaten
braganza
or
mortier
almeida
but
it
was
necessary
to
make
some
provision
against
even
unlikely
contingencies
the
only
portuguese
force
which
wellesley
had
resolved
to
utilize
for
the
campaign
in
estremadura
was
the
battalion
of
the
loyal
lusitanian
legion
under
colonel
mayne
which
had
been
stationed
at
alcantara
watching
the
movements
of
victor
sir
robert
wilson
now
recalled
from
beresford
s
column
and
placed
once
more
with
his
own
men
was
to
take
up
the
command
of
his
old
force
and
to
add
to
it
the
cazadores
a
regiment
which
had
hitherto
been
lying
with
mackenzie
s
division
at
abrantes
with
these
men
he
was
to
serve
as
the
northern
of
the
british
army
when
it
should
enter
spain
when
wellesley
first
started
upon
his
march
he
was
under
the
impression
that
his
plan
of
campaign
might
be
settled
for
him
by
the
movements
of
victor
rather
than
by
the
devices
of
cuesta
the
rapidity
of
his
progress
was
partly
caused
by
the
news
of
the
marshal
s
attack
on
alcantara
an
operation
which
might
as
it
seemed
turn
out
to
be
the
prelude
of
a
raid
in
force
upon
central
portugal
that
it
portended
an
actual
invasion
with
serious
designs
wellesley
could
not
believe
being
convinced
that
victor
would
have
to
leave
so
large
a
proportion
of
his
army
to
observe
cuesta
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
set
aside
more
than
or
men
for
operations
in
the
valley
of
the
tagus
but
such
a
force
would
be
enough
to
sweep
the
country
about
castello
branco
and
villa
velha
and
to
beat
up
mackenzie
s
line
of
defence
on
the
zezere
wellesley
to
mackenzie
from
san
tyrso
may
the
actual
course
of
events
on
the
tagus
had
been
as
follows
victor
even
after
having
received
the
division
of
lapisse
considered
himself
too
weak
either
to
march
on
cuesta
and
drive
him
over
the
mountains
into
andalusia
or
to
fall
upon
central
portugal
by
an
advance
along
the
tagus
he
had
received
vague
information
of
the
formation
of
mackenzie
s
corps
of
observation
on
the
zezere
though
apparently
he
had
not
discovered
that
there
was
a
strong
british
contingent
in
its
ranks
but
he
was
under
the
impression
that
if
he
crossed
the
guadiana
in
force
to
attack
cuesta
the
portuguese
would
advance
into
estremadura
and
cut
his
communications
while
if
he
marched
against
the
portuguese
cuesta
would
move
northward
to
attack
his
rear
accordingly
he
maintained
for
some
time
a
purely
defensive
attitude
keeping
his
three
french
infantry
divisions
concentrated
in
a
central
position
at
torremocha
montanches
and
salvatierra
near
caceres
while
he
remained
himself
with
leval
s
germans
and
s
dragoons
in
the
neighbourhood
of
merida
observing
cuesta
and
sending
flying
columns
up
and
down
the
guadiana
to
watch
the
garrison
of
badajoz
and
the
guerrillas
of
the
sierra
de
guadalupe
he
had
not
forgotten
the
emperor
s
orders
that
he
was
to
be
prepared
to
execute
a
diversion
in
favour
of
marshal
soult
when
he
should
hear
that
the
corps
was
on
its
way
to
lisbon
but
like
all
the
other
french
generals
he
was
profoundly
ignorant
of
the
position
and
the
fortunes
of
the
duke
of
dalmatia
on
april
the
staff
at
madrid
had
received
no
more
than
a
vague
rumour
that
the
corps
had
entered
oporto
a
month
before
they
got
no
trustworthy
information
concerning
its
doings
till
may
was
far
advanced
victor
therefore
depending
on
king
joseph
for
his
news
from
northern
portugal
was
completely
in
the
dark
as
to
the
moment
when
he
might
be
called
upon
to
execute
his
diversion
on
the
tagus
the
portuguese
and
galician
insurgents
had
succeeded
in
maintaining
a
complete
blockade
of
soult
and
thus
had
foiled
all
napoleon
s
plans
for
combining
the
operations
of
the
and
the
corps
compare
the
two
dispatches
of
victor
to
jourdan
of
april
acknowledging
the
receipt
of
lapisse
s
division
and
of
may
see
king
joseph
to
napoleon
of
the
dates
april
and
may
victor
was
only
stirred
up
into
a
spasmodic
activity
in
the
second
week
in
may
by
the
news
that
a
portuguese
force
had
crossed
the
frontier
and
occupied
alcantara
where
the
great
roman
bridge
across
the
tagus
provided
a
line
of
communication
between
and
central
estremadura
this
detachment
as
we
have
already
seen
consisted
of
no
more
than
colonel
mayne
s
battalion
of
the
loyal
lusitanian
legion
brought
down
from
the
passes
of
the
sierra
de
gata
and
of
a
single
regiment
of
militia
that
of
the
frontier
district
of
idanha
they
had
with
them
the
six
guns
of
the
battery
of
the
legion
and
a
solitary
squadron
of
cavalry
wellesley
had
thrown
forward
this
little
force
of
men
to
serve
as
an
outpost
for
mackenzie
s
corps
on
the
zezere
but
rumour
magnified
its
strength
and
victor
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
it
formed
the
vanguard
of
a
portuguese
army
which
was
intending
to
concert
a
combined
operation
with
cuesta
by
threatening
the
communication
of
the
corps
while
the
spaniards
attacked
its
front
labouring
under
this
delusion
victor
took
the
division
of
lapisse
and
a
brigade
of
dragoons
and
marched
against
alcantara
upon
the
eleventh
of
may
as
he
approached
the
river
he
was
met
at
brozas
by
mayne
s
vedettes
whom
he
soon
drove

barricaded
and
mined

planted
his

as
to
command
the

constructed

for

victor
opened

fire
of
artillery
and
musketry
against

detachment
it
was
met
by
a
vigorous
return
from
the
further
bank
which
lasted
for
more
than
three
hours
before
the
defence
began
to
flag
the

very
properly
refused

of

at
about
midday
the

had
already
suffered
not
inconsiderable
losses
deserted
their
trenches
and
fled
thereupon
mayne
fired
his
mine
in

bridge
but
unhappily
for
him
the
tough
roman
cement
defied
even
the
power
of

only
one
side
of
the
arch
was
shattered
the
crown
of

vault
held
firm
and
the
passage
was
still
possible
the
legion
still
kept
its
ground
though
it
had
lost
many
men
and
had
seen
one
of
his
guns
dismounted
and
the
rest
silenced
by
the
french
artillery
but
when
victor
hurled
the
leading
brigade
of
lapisse

division
at
the
bridge
he
succeeded
in
forcing
it
mayne
drew
off
his
legionaries
in

order

retreated
to

victor
went
no
further
than
alcantara
having
satisfied
himself
that
the
portuguese
force
which
had
made
such
a
creditable
resistance
consisted
of
a
single
weak
brigade
and
did
not
form
the
vanguard
of
an
army
bent
on
invading
estremadura
after
remaining
for
no
more
than
three
days
at
alcantara
and
trying
in
vain
to
obtain
news
of
the
whereabouts
of
soult
who
was
at
that
moment
being
hunted
past
guimaraens
and
braga
in
the
far
north
the
marshal
drew
back
his
troops
to
torremocha
near
caceres
his
advance
though
it
had
only
lasted
for
six
days
and
had
not
been
pushed
more
than
a
few
miles
beyond
alcantara
had
much
disturbed
general
mackenzie
who
dreaded
to
find
himself
the
next
object
of
attack
and
to
see
the
whole
of
the
corps
debouching
against
him
by
the
road
through
castello
branco
wellesley
wrote
to
him
that
he
need
not
be
alarmed
that
victor
could
not
spare
more
than
or
men
for
his
demonstration
and
that
the
british
and
portuguese
troops
behind
the
zezere
were
amply
sufficient
to
maintain
defensive
operations
till
the
main
army
from
the
north
should
come
up
he
expressed
his
opinion
that
the
french
force
at
alcantara
was
a
mere
reconnoitring
party
sent
out
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
what
has
become
of
soult
a
conclusion
in
which
he
was
perfectly
right
mackenzie
who
betrayed
an
exaggerated
want
of
confidence
in
his
portuguese
troops
was
profoundly
relieved
to
see
the
enemy
retire
upon
the
seventeenth
he
had
advanced
from
abrantes
and
taken
up
a
defensive
position
along
the
sobreira
formosa
to
resist
the
marshal
but
he
had
done
so
with
many
searchings
of
heart
and
was
glad
to
see
the
danger
pass
away
when
victor
had
retired
into
central
estremadura
mayne
came
back
with
all
due
caution
and
reoccupied
the
bridge
of
alcantara
see
wellesley
to
mackenzie
may
and
also
wellesley
to
frere
on
the
same
day
iv
wellesley
therefore
had
been
perfectly
well
justified
in
his
confidence
that
nothing
was
to
be
feared
in
this
direction
the
french
could
not
possibly
have
dared
to
undertake
more
than
a
demonstration
in
the
direction
of
castello
branco
king
joseph
s
orders
to
victor
had
prescribed
no
more
and
the
marshal
had
accomplished
even
less
in
his
letter
of
excuse
to
jourdan
he
explained
that
he
would
gladly
have
left
lapisse
s
division
at
alcantara
or
even
have
moved
it
forward
for
some
distance
into
portugal
if
he
had
not
found
it
absolutely
impossible
to
feed
it
in
the
bare
and
stony
district
north
of
the
tagus
where
junot
s
army
had
been
wellnigh
starved
in
november
the
peasantry
of
the
villages
for
fifteen
leagues
round
alcantara
had
as
he
declared
gone
off
into
the
mountains
with
their
cattle
after
burying
their
corn
and
he
had
found
it
impossible
to
discover
food
for
even
three
days
consumption
of
a
single
division
see
jourdan
s
a
move
by
which
he
flattered
himself
that
he
would
not
only
inquiéter
les
anglais
but
also
dégager
le
duc
de
dalmatie
an
end
which
no
raid
with
or
men
to
castello
branco
could
possibly
have
accomplished
victor
to
jourdan
may
during
victor
s
absence
at
alcantara
cuesta
had
sent
down
a
part
of
his
troops
to
make
a
raid
on
merida
the
marshal
s
advanced
post
on
the
guadiana
it
failed
entirely
the
garrison
two
battalions
of
leval
s
german
division
maintained
themselves
with
ease
in
a
large
convent
outside
that
town
which
victor
had
patched
up
and
turned
into
a
place
of
some
little
strength
on
hearing
that
the
spaniards
were
descending
from
the
mountains
king
joseph
ordered
the
duke
of
belluno
to
attack
them
at
once
but
on
the
mere
news
of
the
marshal
s
approach
cuesta
called
back
his
detachment
into
the
passes
sweeping
off
at
the
same
time
the
inhabitants
of
all
the
villages
along
the
guadiana
together
with
their
cattle
and
their
stores
of
provisions
at
the
beginning
of
june
victor
began
to
press
the
king
and
jourdan
for
leave
to
abandon
his
hold
on
southern
estremadura
and
to
fall
back
towards
the
tagus
he
urged
that
his
position
was
very
dangerous
now
that
cuesta
s
army
had
been
recruited
up
to
a
force
of
infantry
and
horse
especially
since
the
portuguese
had
once
more
got
possession
of
alcantara
his
main
contention
was
that
he
must
either
be
reinforced
up
to
a
strength
which
would
permit
him
to
attack
andalusia
or
else
be
permitted
to
withdraw
from
the
exhausted
district
between
the
guadiana
and
the
tagus
in
order
to
seek
a
region
where
his
men
would
be
able
to
live
the
only
district
in
this
neighbourhood
where
the
was
still
intact
was
that
north
of
the
tagus
around
the
towns
of
plasencia
and
coria
the
valleys
of
the
alagon
and
tietar
to
move
the
army
in
this
direction
would
involve
the
evacuation
of
central
estremadura
it
would
be
necessary
to
abandon
merida
truxillo
and
caceres
with
the
sacrifice
of
a
certain
amount
of
prestige
but
unless
the
corps
could
be
reinforced
and
this
as
victor
must
have
known
was
impossible
there
was
no
other
alternative
the
internal
condition
of
the
army
was
growing
worse
day
by
day
the
troops
are
on
half
rations
of
bread
they
can
get
little
meat
often
none
at
all
the
results
of
starvation
are
making
themselves
felt
in
the
most
deplorable
way
the
men
are
going
into
hospital
at
the
rate
of
several
hundreds
a
day
a
few
days
later
victor
adds
if
i
could
even
get
together
enough
biscuit
to
feed
the
army
for
merely
seven
or
eight
days
i
should
not
feel
so
uncomfortable
but
we
have
no
flour
to
issue
for
a
bread
ration
so
can
not
bake
biscuit
and
again
he
adds
the
whole
population
of
this
region
has
retired
within
cuesta
s
lines
after
destroying
the
ovens
and
the
mills
and
removing
every
scrap
of
food
it
seems
that
the
enemy
is
resolved
to
starve
us
out
and
to
leave
a
desert
in
front
of
us
if
we
advance
carefully
estimating
all
my
stores
i
find
that
i
have
barely
enough
to
last
for
five
days
in
hand
we
are
menaced
with
absolute
famine
which
we
can
only
avoid
by
moving
off
and
there
is
no
suitable
cantonment
to
be
found
in
the
whole
space
between
tagus
and
guadiana
the
entire
country
is
he
suggests
in
a
letter
of
june
that
mortier
s
corps
should
be
brought
up
to
plasencia
to
help
him
but
this
was
wholly
impracticable
victor
to
jourdan
from
torremocha
may
victor
to
jourdan
may
joseph
and
jourdan
replied
to
the
first
of
these
dismal
letters
by
promising
to
send
the
corps
rations
of
biscuit
and
by
urging
its
commander
to
renew
his
attack
on
alcantara
in
order
to
threaten
portugal
and
disengage
the
duke
of
dalmatia
who
on
the
day
when
their
dispatch
was
written
was
at
lugo
in
the
north
of
galicia
some
miles
as
the
crow
flies
from
victor
s
head
quarters
they
received
the
answer
that
such
a
move
was
impossible
as
mayne
had
just
blown
up
the
bridge
of
alcantara
and
it
was
now
impossible
to
cross
the
tagus
jourdan
to
victor
june
victor
to
jourdan
june
oddly
enough
he
was
wrong
in
his
statement
by
two
days
for
mayne
blew
up
the
bridge
on
the
tenth
only
a
few
days
later
the
news
arrived
at
madrid
that
soult
had
been
defeated
and
flung
out
of
portugal
it
had
taken
three
weeks
for
information
of
this
transcendent
importance
to
reach
the
king
seriously
alarmed
joseph
and
jourdan
sent
victor
his
permission
to
retire
from
estremadura
and
place
himself
behind
the
tagus
they
do
not
seem
to
have
guessed
that
the
victorious
wellesley
would
make
his
next
move
against
the
corps
but
imagined
that
he
would
debouch
into
old
castile
by
way
of
rodrigo
and
salamanca
wherefore
their
main
idea
was
to
strengthen
mortier
and
the
army
in
the
valley
of
the
douro
thus
it
fell
in
with
their
views
that
victor
should
draw
back
to
the
line
of
the
tagus
a
general
concentration
of
all
the
french
troops
in
the
peninsula
seeming
advisable
in
face
of
the
necessity
for
resisting
the
supposed
attack
on
old
castile
another
reason
for
assuming
a
defensive
attitude
was
the
gloomy
news
from
aragon
where
suchet
after
his
defeat
at
alcañiz
had
retired
on
saragossa
and
was
sending
despairing
appeals
for
reinforcements
to
madrid
june
joseph
to
napoleon
cf
joseph
s
letters
of
june
and
june
to
napoleon
but
there
seems
to
be
much
vacillation
in
his
decisions
accordingly
the
corps
evacuated
estremadura
between
the
fourteenth
and
the
nineteenth
of
june
and
crossing
the
tagus
disposed
itself
in
a
position
on
the
northern
bank
with
its
right
wing
at
almaraz
and
its
left
at
talavera
here
victor
intended
to
make
his
stand
being
confident
that
with
the
broad
river
in
front
of
him
he
could
easily
beat
off
any
attack
on
the
part
of
the
spanish
army
but
when
wellesley
and
cuesta
first
began
to
correspond
concerning
their
joint
movement
against
the
french
in
estremadura
victor
was
still
in
his
old
cantonments
and
their
scheme
of
operations
had
been
sketched
out
on
the
hypothesis
that
he
lay
at
merida
torremocha
and
caceres
it
was
with
the
design
of
assailing
him
while
he
still
held
this
advanced
position
that
cuesta
drew
up
his
paper
of
answers
to
wellesley
s
queries
and
dispatched
it
to
abrantes
to
meet
the
british
general
on
his
arrival
cuesta
s
replies
sent
on
by
bourke
are
dated
june
and
june
ten
and
eight
days
respectively
before
victor
began
his
retreat
beyond
the
tagus
on
june
if
the
old
s
suggestions
were
by
no
means
marked
with
the
stamp
of
genius
they
had
at
least
the
merit
of
variety
he
offered
wellesley
the
choice
between
no
less
than
three
plans
of
campaign
his
first
proposal
was
that
the
british
army
should
descend
into
southern
estremadura
and
join
him
in
the
neighbourhood
of
badajoz
from
thence
the
united
host
was
to
advance
against
victor
and
assail
him
in
front
but
meanwhile
cuesta
proposed
to
send
out
two
subsidiary
columns
to
turn
the
marshal
s
flanks
and
surround
him
one
was
to
base
itself
on
alcantara
and
march
along
the
northern
bank
of
the
tagus
to
seize
almaraz
the
other
was
to
push
by
la
serena
through
the
guadalupe
mountains
to
threaten
talavera
by
these
operations
if
victor
would
be
good
enough
to
remain
quiet
in
his
present
cantonments
he
would
be
completely
surrounded
his
retreat
would
be
cut
off
and
he
would
finally
be
compelled
to
surrender
the
scheme
was
of
course
preposterous
what
rational
man
could
have
supposed
it
likely
that
the
marshal
would
remain
quiescent
while
his
flanks
were
being
turned
he
would
certainly
have
hastened
to
retire
and
to
throw
himself
upon
the
detached
columns
one
or
both
of
which
he
could
have
annihilated
before
the
main
armies
of
the
allies
could
get
within
touch
of
him
wellesley
refused
to
listen
for
a
moment
to
this
plan
of
campaign
the
second
proposal
of
cuesta
was
that
the
british
army
should
pass
the
tagus
at
alcantara
and
operate
against
victor
s
flank
while
the
spanish
army
attacked
him
in
front
to
this
the
same
objection
could
be
urged
it
presupposed
that
the
frenchman
would
remain
fixed
in
his
present
cantonments
but
he
certainly
would
not
do
so
when
he
heard
that
he
was
to
be
assailed
on
both
flanks
he
would
retire
behind
the
tagus
at
once
and
the
british
army
would
have
wasted
its
march
and
be
obliged
to
return
to
the
north
bank
of
that
river
moreover
it
would
involve
a
very
long
movement
to
the
south
to
get
in
touch
with
victor
s
flank
probably
it
would
be
necessary
to
descend
as
far
into
estremadura
as
caceres
and
when
that
point
was
reached
the
marshal
could
make
the
whole
manœuvre
futile
by
retiring
at
once
behind
the
tagus
at
almaraz
to
follow
him
to
the
north
bank
the
british
would
have
to
retrace
their
steps
to
alcantara
wellesley
writes
in
commenting
on
this
plan
iv
at
all
events
these
two
detachments
on
the
two
flanks
appear
to
me
to
be
too
weak
to
produce
any
great
effect
upon
the
movements
of
victor
i
think
it
would
be
nearly
certain
that
the
marshal
would
be
able
to
defend
the
passage
of
the
tagus
with
a
part
only
of
his
force
while
with
the
other
part
he
would
beat
one
or
both
of
the
detachments
sent
round
his
flank
indeed
the
detachment
which
should
have
been
sent
from
la
serena
toward
talavera
being
between
the
corps
of
victor
and
sebastiani
could
hardly
wellesley
also
points
out
that
it
is
useless
to
expect
that
victor
would
wait
in
his
present
cantonments
at
the
first
news
of
the
approach
of
the
british
army
he
will
retire
to
almaraz
and
arzobispo
the
third
proposal
of
cuesta
the
only
one
in
which
wellesley
could
find
any
prospect
of
success
was
that
the
british
army
keeping
north
of
the
tagus
should
march
by
castello
branco
on
plasencia
there
it
would
be
in
the
rear
of
victor
s
best
line
of
retreat
by
the
bridge
of
almaraz
if
the
manœuvre
could
be
kept
very
secret
and
executed
with
great
speed
almaraz
perhaps
also
the
subsidiary
passage
at
arzobispo
might
be
seized
should
the
marshal
get
early
news
of
the
movement
and
hurry
back
across
the
tagus
to
fend
off
this
stab
in
the
rear
wellesley
was
prepared
to
fight
him
in
the
open
with
equal
forces
conceiving
that
he
was
sufficiently
strong
to
defend
himself
against
any
attack
which
victor
might
he
hoped
that
cuesta
was
able
to
guarantee
that
he
also
was
competent
to
hold
his
own
supposing
that
the
marshal
neglecting
the
british
diversion
should
concentrate
his
corps
and
strike
at
the
spanish
army
on
the
whole
therefore
wellesley
was
not
disinclined
to
fall
in
with
this
plan
which
had
the
extra
merit
of
remaining
feasible
even
if
victor
withdrew
north
of
the
tagus
before
either
of
the
allied
armies
had
completed
its
march
he
made
one
countersuggestion
viz
that
cuesta
might
move
eastward
with
the
whole
or
part
of
his
army
join
the
army
of
venegas
in
la
mancha
and
attack
sebastiani
leaving
the
british
alone
to
deal
with
victor
but
he
did
not
wish
to
press
this
plan
thinking
that
an
attack
on
the
enemy
s
left
was
on
first
principles
less
advisable
than
one
on
his
right
because
it
did
not
offer
any
chance
of
cutting
him
off
from
madrid
i
print
as
an
appendix
this
letter
to
bourke
regarding
cuesta
s
three
plans
of
campaign
the
answer
to
cuesta
s
proposals
was
sent
off
from
abrantes
which
wellesley
preceding
his
army
by
three
or
four
days
march
reached
upon
june
he
had
now
under
his
hand
mackenzie
s
force
but
the
leading
brigades
of
the
troops
who
had
fought
at
oporto
could
not
arrive
before
the
eleventh
or
twelfth
there
was
thus
ample
time
to
concert
the
joint
plan
of
campaign
before
the
whole
army
would
be
concentrated
and
ready
to
move
but
when
cuesta
s
reply
to
the
dispatch
of
june
came
to
hand
upon
june
wellesley
was
much
vexed
to
find
that
the
old
had
expressed
a
great
dislike
for
the
idea
that
the
british
army
should
march
upon
plasencia
and
almaraz
though
it
had
been
one
of
his
own
three
suggestions
he
now
pleaded
urgently
in
favour
of
the
first
of
his
original
alternatives
that
wellesley
should
come
down
to
badajoz
and
join
him
in
a
frontal
attack
upon
victor
with
much
reluctance
the
british
general
resolved
to
comply
apparently
moved
by
his
ally
s
openly
expressed
dislike
to
being
left
to
face
victor
alone
i
must
acknowledge
he
wrote
to
colonel
bourke
that
entertain
no
apprehension
that
the
french
will
attack
general
cuesta
i
am
much
more
afraid
that
they
are
going
away
and
strengthening
themselves
upon
the
tagus
to
the
spanish
general
he
sent
a
dispatch
to
the
same
effect
in
which
he
pledged
himself
to
march
to
join
the
army
of
estremadura
though
he
frankly
stated
that
all
his
information
led
him
to
believe
that
victor
had
no
intention
of
taking
the
offensive
and
that
the
junction
was
therefore
unnecessary
he
expressed
his
hope
that
cuesta
would
avoid
all
fighting
till
they
had
met
the
only
possible
danger
to
the
allied
cause
being
that
one
of
the
two
armies
should
suffer
a
defeat
before
the
other
had
started
on
the
combined
movement
to
which
they
were
committed
wellesley
to
bourke
from
abrantes
june
wellesley
to
cuesta
from
abrantes
june
fortunately
for
all
parties
concerned
the
march
on
badajoz
which
wellesley
so
much
disliked
never
had
to
be
begun
for
on
the
day
after
he
had
sent
off
his
dispatch
to
cuesta
he
received
reliable
information
from
several
sources
to
the
effect
that
victor
had
evacuated
and
blown
up
the
fortified
convent
of
merida
and
had
sent
off
all
his
baggage
and
heavy
artillery
towards
almaraz
during
the
next
four
days
the
whole
of
the
corps
marched
for
that
bridge
and
crossed
it
on
the
nineteenth
victor
had
established
his
entire
army
north
of
the
tagus
at
almaraz
arzobispo
and
talavera
thus
the
whole
face
of
affairs
was
changed
and
the
advance
of
the
british
army
into
southern
estremadura
was
rendered
unnecessary
it
was
fortunate
that
the
news
of
the
retreat
of
the
corps
was
received
at
abrantes
just
in
time
to
allow
of
the
countermanding
of
the
march
of
wellesley
s
army
on
badajoz
for
that
fruitless
movement
would
have
begun
if
the
duke
of
belluno
had
been
able
to
retain
his
starving
army
in
its
positions
for
a
few
days
longer
section
xvi
chapter
ii
wellesley
enters
spain
the
retreat
of
victor
beyond
the
tagus
forced
wellesley
to
concert
yet
another
plan
of
operation
with
cuesta
since
the
position
of
the
french
army
on
which
the
whole
of
the
recently
adopted
scheme
depended
had
just
suffered
a
radical
change
it
was
clear
that
every
consideration
now
pointed
to
the
necessity
for
adopting
the
combination
which
wellesley
had
urged
upon
his
colleague
in
his
letter
of
june
viz
that
the
british
army
should
move
on
plasencia
and
almaraz
it
would
now
be
striking
at
the
flank
instead
of
the
rear
of
victor
s
corps
but
it
was
clear
that
under
the
new
conditions
it
would
still
be
in
a
position
to
roll
up
his
whole
army
if
he
should
endeavour
to
defend
the
passages
of
the
tagus
against
the
spaniards
who
were
now
approaching
them
from
the
front
for
cuesta
had
descended
from
the
mountains
when
he
heard
of
victor
s
retreat
and
was
now
approaching
almaraz
it
took
some
time
however
to
induce
the
to
consent
to
this
move
to
the
extreme
vexation
of
his
colleague
he
produced
other
plans
so
gratuitously
impracticable
that
wellesley
wrote
to
castlereagh
to
say
that
he
could
conceive
no
explanation
for
the
old
man
s
conduct
save
a
desire
to
refuse
any
scheme
urged
on
him
by
others
and
a
resolve
to
invent
and
advocate
alternative
plans
of
his
own
out
of
mere
pride
and
wrongheadedness
the
best
of
the
whole
story
he
added
was
that
cuesta
was
now
refusing
to
accept
a
plan
which
he
himself
had
suggested
in
one
of
his
earlier
letters
merely
because
that
plan
had
been
taken
up
and
advocated
by
his
ally
the
obstinacy
of
this
old
gentleman
he
concluded
is
throwing
out
of
our
hands
the
finest
game
that
any
armies
ever
had
wellesley
to
castlereagh
abrantes
june
the
real
cause
of
cuesta
s
angry
and
impracticable
attitude
will
be
shown
in
the
next
chapter
wellesley
to
frere
from
the
same
place
june
the
necessity
for
working
out
a
new
scheme
for
the
combined
operations
of
the
british
and
spanish
armies
in
view
of
victor
s
retreat
to
almaraz
entailed
the
loss
of
a
few
days
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
start
on
the
advance
to
plasencia
till
cuesta
had
promised
to
accept
that
movement
as
part
of
the
joint
campaign
there
was
also
some
time
to
be
allowed
for
concluding
an
agreement
with
venegas
the
general
of
the
la
carolina
army
whose
connexion
with
the
campaign
must
become
much
more
intimate
now
that
the
fighting
was
to
take
place
not
in
estremadura
but
further
north
in
the
valley
of
the
tagus
for
while
victor
lay
at
merida
and
sebastiani
at
manzanares
and
ciudad
real
the
spanish
forces
which
faced
them
were
very
far
apart
but
when
victor
retired
to
talavera
and
sebastiani
to
madridejos
in
the
end
of
june
cuesta
and
venegas
each
following
the
corps
opposed
to
him
could
draw
closer
together
it
was
evident
that
the
andalusian
army
ought
to
be
made
to
play
an
important
part
in
the
combined
operations
of
july
it
would
be
unfair
to
the
spanish
generals
to
let
it
be
supposed
that
the
necessity
for
settling
on
a
common
scheme
of
operations
with
them
was
the
sole
cause
which
detained
wellesley
at
abrantes
from
the
eighth
to
the
of
june
the
leading
brigades
of
the
british
troops
from
oporto
had
begun
to
reach
abrantes
on
the
eleventh
and
the
more
belated
columns
came
up
on
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
but
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
have
moved
forward
without
some
further
delay
even
if
wellesley
had
been
in
possession
of
a
complete
and
satisfactory
plan
of
operations
on
the
day
upon
which
his
whole
force
was
concentrated
on
the
line
of
the
zezere
at
the
least
he
would
have
required
another
week
for
preparations
his
hindrances
at
this
moment
were
manifold
the
first
was
the
distressed
condition
of
those
of
his
brigades
which
had
seen
most
service
during
the
oporto
campaign
many
regiments
had
been
constantly
on
the
march
from
may
to
june
without
obtaining
more
than
two
days
rest
in
the
whole
time
their
shoes
were
worn
out
their
jaded
had
dropped
to
the
rear
and
they
were
leaving
so
many
stragglers
on
the
way
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
give
them
a
moderate
rest
at
abrantes
in
order
to
allow
the
ranks
to
grow
full
and
the
belated
baggage
to
come
up
the
regiments
which
had
followed
beresford
in
the
forced
march
from
amarante
to
chaves
were
worst
off
they
had
never
completely
recovered
from
the
fatigues
of
those
three
days
of
constant
rain
and
storm
spent
on
the
stony
roads
of
the
in
any
case
some
delay
must
have
occurred
before
all
the
troops
were
ready
to
march
but
many
circumstances
conspired
to
detain
the
army
at
abrantes
for
several
days
after
the
moment
at
which
wellesley
had
determined
to
start
for
plasencia
the
first
was
the
of
convoys
of
shoes
and
clothing
which
he
had
ordered
up
from
lisbon
the
transport
of
the
army
was
not
yet
fully
organized
its
officers
were
lacking
in
experience
if
not
in
zeal
and
orders
were
slowly
executed
many
corps
had
in
the
end
to
start
for
spain
without
receiving
the
stores
which
were
still
trailing
up
from
santarem
to
abrantes
when
wellesley
gave
the
signal
to
advance
another
hindrance
was
the
lack
of
money
the
army
was
obliged
to
pay
for
its
wants
in
coin
but
hard
cash
was
so
difficult
to
procure
both
in
london
and
in
lisbon
that
arrears
were
already
beginning
to
grow
up
at
first
they
vexed
the
soul
of
wellesley
almost
beyond
endurance
but
as
the
war
dragged
on
they
only
grew
worse
and
the
had
to
endure
with
resignation
the
fact
that
both
the
pay
of
the
men
and
the
wages
of
the
portuguese
muleteers
and
followers
were
overdue
for
many
months
in
june
he
had
not
yet
reached
this
state
of
comparative
callousness
and
was
endeavouring
to
scrape
together
money
by
every
possible
device
he
had
borrowed
in
portuguese
silver
from
the
merchants
of
the
impoverished
city
of
oporto
he
was
trying
to
exchange
bills
on
england
for
dollars
at
cadiz
where
the
arrival
of
the
american
contribution
had
produced
a
comparative
plenty
of
the
circulating
medium
yet
after
all
he
had
to
start
from
abrantes
with
only
a
comparatively
moderate
sum
in
his
military
chest
the
rest
had
not
reached
him
on
june
the
treasure
convoy
having
taken
the
unconscionable
time
of
eleven
days
to
crawl
forward
from
lisbon
to
abrantes
a
distance
of
no
more
than
ninety
miles
with
regard
to
these
regiments
wellesley
writes
in
very
bitter
terms
to
donkin
on
june
saying
that
the
number
of
their
stragglers
was
scandalous
and
that
the
laggards
were
committing
all
manner
of
disorders
in
the
rear
of
the
army
it
is
fair
to
remember
that
the
battalions
had
suffered
exceptional
hardships
as
may
be
seen
from
the
narratives
of
gough
of
the
and
grattan
of
the
the
main
convoy
only
reached
abrantes
when
wellesley
had
advanced
to
plasencia
in
spain
see
letter
to
the
officer
commanding
artillery
at
castello
branco
dated
july
from
plasencia
cf
wellesley
to
frere
june
to
murray
june
both
from
abrantes
and
to
castlereagh
june
a
third
cause
of
delay
was
the
time
spent
in
waiting
for
reinforcements
from
lisbon
eight
or
nine
regiments
had
landed
or
were
expected
to
arrive
within
the
next
few
days
it
was
in
every
way
desirable
to
unite
them
to
the
army
before
the
campaign
should
begin
this
was
all
the
more
necessary
because
several
corps
had
to
be
deducted
from
the
force
which
had
been
used
in
the
oporto
campaign
under
stringent
orders
from
home
wellesley
had
sent
back
two
infantry
battalions
and
part
of
two
cavalry
regiments
to
lisbon
to
be
embarked
for
gibraltar
and
sicily
in
return
he
was
to
receive
a
much
larger
body
of
troops
but
while
the
deduction
was
immediate
the
addition
took
time
of
all
the
troops
which
were
expected
to
reinforce
the
army
only
one
battalion
caught
him
up
at
abrantes
while
a
second
and
one
regiment
of
light
dragoons
joined
later
but
yet
in
time
for
talavera
thus
at
the
commencement
of
the
actual
campaign
the
force
in
the
field
was
if
anything
slightly
less
in
numbers
than
that
which
had
been
available
in
may
it
was
particularly
vexatious
that
the
brigade
of
veteran
light
infantry
for
which
wellesley
had
made
a
special
demand
on
castlereagh
as
early
as
april
did
not
reach
abrantes
till
long
after
the
army
had
moved
forward
these
three
battalions
the
nucleus
of
the
famous
light
division
had
all
gone
through
the
experiences
of
moore
s
campaign
and
were
once
more
under
their
old
leader
robert
craufurd
detained
by
baffling
winds
in
the
downs
the
transports
that
bore
them
only
reached
lisbon
at
various
dates
between
june
and
july
though
they
had
sailed
on
may
their
indefatigable
brigadier
hurried
them
forward
with
all
speed
to
the
front
but
in
spite
of
his
exertions
they
only
came
up
with
the
main
army
after
the
day
of
battle
was
over
the
same
was
the
fate
of
two
batteries
of
horse
artillery
an
arm
in
which
wellesley
was
wholly
deficient
when
he
marched
into
spain
they
arrived
late
and
were
still
far
to
the
rear
when
the
march
from
abrantes
began
the
and
were
sent
to
gibraltar
in
may
the
two
squadrons
of
the
light
dragoons
and
the
one
squadron
of
the
hussars
of
the
were
sent
to
sicily
at
the
same
time
the
and
light
dragoons
of
these
three
units
only
had
been
in
robert
craufurd
s
old
brigade
during
the
march
to
sahagun
the
other
two
had
been
in
anstruther
s
brigade
of
paget
s
reserve
they
had
therefore
fought
at
corunna
while
craufurd
and
the
flank
brigade
which
includes
the
had
been
detached
from
the
main
army
and
had
embarked
at
vigo
a
and
i
troops
the
first
joined
in
company
with
craufurd
the
second
only
appeared
much
later
it
thus
resulted
that
although
there
were
over
british
troops
in
the
peninsula
at
the
commencement
of
july
less
than
could
be
collected
for
the
advance
on
plasencia
which
was
now
about
to
begin
more
than
men
lay
at
lisbon
or
were
just
starting
from
that
city
while
were
in
hospital
the
sick
seemed
more
numerous
than
might
have
been
expected
at
the
season
of
the
year
though
the
fatigues
of
the
oporto
campaign
accounted
for
the
majority
of
the
invalids
yet
wellesley
was
of
opinion
that
a
contributory
cause
might
be
found
in
the
slack
discipline
of
certain
regiments
where
inefficient
commanding
officers
had
neglected
sanitary
precautions
and
allowed
their
men
to
neglect
personal
cleanliness
or
to
indulge
to
excess
in
wine
and
unripe
fruit
and
vegetables
it
was
his
opinion
that
the
number
of
men
in
hospital
should
never
exceed
ten
per
cent
of
the
total
force
but
all
through
the
war
he
found
that
this
proportion
was
exceeded
writing
to
castlereagh
on
june
wellesley
remarks
that
according
to
your
account
i
have
men
according
to
my
own
i
have
only
but
this
was
before
he
had
been
joined
by
the
the
dragoons
and
certain
details
it
is
certain
from
the
careful
table
of
troops
engaged
at
talavera
which
is
to
be
found
in
the
record
office
that
somewhat
over
men
entered
spain
and
that
after
deducting
sick
left
at
plasencia
and
elsewhere
just
fought
at
talavera
with
the
internal
condition
of
many
of
his
regiments
wellesley
was
far
from
satisfied
his
tendency
to
use
the
plainest
indeed
the
harshest
terms
concerning
the
rank
and
file
is
so
well
known
that
we
are
not
surprised
to
find
him
writing
that
the
army
behave
terribly
ill
they
are
a
rabble
who
can
not
bear
success
any
more
than
sir
john
moore
s
army
could
bear
failure
he
complained
most
of
all
of
the
recruits
sent
him
from
the
irish
militia
who
were
he
said
capable
of
every
sin
moral
or
military
though
he
was
endeavouring
to
tame
the
troops
yet
there
were
several
regiments
in
such
bad
order
that
he
would
gladly
have
sent
them
home
in
disgrace
if
he
could
have
spared
a
man
the
main
offence
of
course
was
robbery
of
food
from
the
portuguese
peasantry
often
accompanied
by
violence
and
now
and
then
by
murder
the
number
of
was
multiplied
some
offenders
were
caught
and
hanged
but
marauding
could
not
be
suppressed
even
while
the
troops
were
receiving
full
rations
in
their
cantonments
at
abrantes
when
they
were
enduring
real
privation
in
the
wilds
of
estremadura
matters
grew
much
worse
though
many
regiments
were
distinguished
for
their
good
behaviour
yet
there
were
always
some
whose
excesses
were
a
disgrace
to
the
british
army
their
commander
never
shrank
from
telling
them
so
in
the
most
incisive
language
he
was
always
complaining
that
he
could
not
get
a
sufficient
number
of
the
criminals
flogged
or
hanged
and
that
regimental
were
far
too
lenient
in
their
dealings
with
offenders
these
topics
occur
in
many
dispatches
to
castlereagh
perhaps
the
most
notable
is
that
of
may
written
at
coimbra
wellesley
s
anxiety
to
make
examples
may
be
traced
in
the
series
of
letters
concerning
a
private
of
the
which
occur
in
his
july
dispatches
the
man
had
been
acquitted
by
a
on
the
ground
of
insanity
but
this
did
not
satisfy
the
who
sends
repeated
orders
that
the
award
must
be
revised
and
the
man
if
possible
executed
it
was
at
abrantes
that
wellesley
first
arranged
his
army
in
divisions
and
gave
it
the
organization
which
with
certain
modifications
it
was
to
maintain
during
the
rest
of
the
war
his
six
regiments
of
cavalry
were
to
form
a
single
division
consisting
of
one
heavy
and
two
light
brigades
commanded
respectively
by
fane
cotton
and
anson
the
battalions
of
infantry
were
distributed
into
four
divisions
of
unequal
strength
under
generals
sherbrooke
hill
mackenzie
and
campbell
of
these
the
first
was
by
far
the
largest
counting
four
brigades
of
two
battalions
each
the
first
henry

was
formed
of
the
two
battalions
of

the

the

and
fourth
under

and
langwerth
comprised
the
infantry
of
the
king
s
german
legion
the
second
and
third
divisions
each
consisted
of
two
brigades
of
three
battalions
each
the
fourth
and
weakest
showed
only
five
battalions
in

of
artillery
there
were
only
thirty
guns
eighteen
english
and
twelve
german
all
were
as
none
of
the
horse
artillery
had
yet
reached
the
front
they
were
all
of
very
light
calibre
the
heaviest
being
a
brigade
of
heavy
belonging
to
the
german
legion
viz
tilson
and
richard
stewart
mackenzie
and
donkin
campbell
and
kemmis
a

were
both
late
for

on

the
army
at
last
moved
forward
that
day
the
head
quarters
were
at
cortiçada
on
the
sobreira
formosa
on
the
thirtieth
castello
branco
the
last
portuguese
town
was
reached
on
july
the
leading
brigades
passed
the
elga
the
frontier
river
and
bivouacked
on
the
same
night
around
zarza
la
mayor
the
first
place
in
spanish
estremadura
at
the
same
time
sir
robert
wilson
s
small
column
of
portuguese
crossed
the
border
a
little
further
north
and
advanced
in
a
direction
parallel
to
that
of
the
main
army
so
as
to
serve
as
a
flank
guard
for
it
in
the
direction
of
the
mountains
king
joseph
meanwhile
was
in
a
state
of
the
most
profound
ignorance
concerning
the
impending
storm
as
late
as
july
he
wrote
to
his
brother
that
the
british
had
not
as
yet
made
any
pronounced
movement
and
that
it
was
quite
uncertain
whether
they
would
invade
galicia
or
strike
at
castile
or
remain
in
the
neighbourhood
of
lisbon
on
that
day
the
head
of
the
british
army
had
entered
plasencia
and
was
only
miles
from
madrid
it
is
impossible
to
give
any
better
testimonial
than
this
simple
fact
to
the
way
in
which
the
insurgents
and
the
guerrillas
served
the
cause
of
the
allies
wellesley
had
been
able
to
march
from
oporto
to
abrantes
and
from
abrantes
to
plasencia
without
even
a
rumour
of
his
advance
reaching
madrid
all
that
joseph
had
learnt
was
that
there
was
now
an
allied
force
of
some
sort
behind
alcantara
in
the
direction
of
castello
branco
he
took
it
for
granted
that
they
were
portuguese
but
in
one
dispatch
he
broaches
the
theory
that
there
might
be
a
few
english
with
them
perhaps
from
having
heard
a
vague
report
of
the
composition
of
mackenzie
s
division
on
the
zezere
in
may
he
therefore
wrote
in
a
cheerful
tone
to
the
emperor
that
if
we
have
only
got
to
deal
with
cuesta
and
the
portuguese
they
will
be
beaten
by
the
corps
if
they
have
some
english
with
them
they
can
be
beaten
equally
well
by
the
corps
aided
by
troops
which
i
can
send
across
the
tagus
via
toledo
the
or
men
of
the
central
reserve
which
could
be
spared
from
madrid
i
am
not
in
the
least
disquieted
he
continued
concerning
the
present
condition
of
military
affairs
in
this
part
of
spain
in
another
epistle
to
his
brother
he
added
that
if
the
english
should
be
at
the
back
of
cuesta
it
would
be
the
happiest
chance
in
the
world
for
the
concluding
of
the
whole
war
joseph
to
napoleon
from
talavera
july
joseph
to
napoleon
from
almagro
july
joseph
to
napoleon
from
madridejos
july
it
is
fair
to
the
king
to
say
that
in
this
letter
he
concludes
that
he
had
better
call
mortier
down
into
new
castile
if
the
english
are
really
on
the
move
it
was
lucky
for
the
king
that
he
was
not
induced
to
try
the
experiment
of
falling
upon
wellesley
and
cuesta
with
the
men
of
victor
and
the
central
reserve
if
he
had
done
so
he
would
have
suffered
a
frightful
disaster
and
have
lost
madrid
in
the
end
of
june
and
the
first
days
of
july
joseph
s
main
attention
had
been
drawn
off
to
that
part
of
his
front
where
there
was
least
danger
so
that
he
was
paying
comparatively
little
heed
to
the
movements
of
the
allies
on
the
lower
tagus
he
had
been
distracted
by
a
rash
and
inexplicable
movement
of
the
spanish
army
of
la
mancha
when
general
venegas
had
heard
of
the
retreat
of
victor
from
estremadura
and
had
been
informed
that
cuesta
was
about
to
move
forward
in
pursuit
of
the
corps
he
had
concluded
that
his
own
troops
might
also
advance
he
argued
that
sebastiani
and
the
corps
must
beat
a
retreat
when
their
right
flank
was
uncovered
by
victor
s
evacuation
of
the
valley
of
the
guadiana
he
was
partly
justified
in
his
idea
for
joseph
had
drawn
back
sebastiani
s
main
body
to
madridejos
when
victor
abandoned
merida
it
was
safe
therefore
to
advance
from
the
despeña
perros
into
the
southern
skirts
of
la
mancha
as
far
as
manzanares
and
the
line
of
the
guadiana
but
to
go
further
forward
was
dangerous
unless
venegas
was
prepared
to
risk
a
collision
with
sebastiani
this
he
was
certainly
not
in
a
condition
to
do
his
troops
had
not
yet
recovered
from
the
moral
effects
of
the
rout
of
ciudad
real
and
his
brigades
were
full
of
new
battalions
of
untried
andalusian
reserves
he
should
have
been
cautious
and
have
refused
to
move
without
concerting
his
operations
with
cuesta
to
have
had
his
corps
put
de
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
joint
campaign
of
the
allied
armies
would
have
been
most
disastrous
nevertheless
venegas
came
down
from
the
passes
of
the
sierra
morena
with
infantry
horse
and
guns
and
proceeded
to
thrust
back
sebastiani
s
cavalry
screen
and
to
push
in
his
outposts
in
front
of
madridejos
the
french
general
had
in
hand
at
this
moment
only
two
infantry
divisions
and
milhaud
s
dragoons
his
third
division
and
his
light
cavalry
were
still
absent
with
victor
to
whom
they
had
been
lent
in
march
for
the
campaign
of
medellin
but
with
foot
and
horse
he
ought
not
to
have
feared
venegas
and
could
have
given
a
good
account
of
him
had
he
chosen
to
attack
but
having
received
exaggerated
reports
of
the
strength
of
the
spanish
army
he
wrote
to
the
king
that
he
was
beset
by
nearly
men
and
must
be
reinforced
at
once
or
he
would
have
to
fall
back
on
madrid
joseph
fully
believing
the
news
sent
orders
to
victor
to
restore
to
the
corps
the
divisions
of
leval
and
merlin
and
then
doubting
whether
these
troops
could
arrive
in
time
sallied
out
of
madrid
on
june
with
his
guards

it
was
lucky
for
venegas
that
sebastiani
had
refused
to
fight
him
but
still
more
lucky
that
the
news
of
the
king
s
approach
reached
him
promptly
on
hearing
that
joseph
had
joined
the
corps
on
june
he
was
wise
enough
to
turn
on
his
heel
and
retreat
in
all
haste
towards
his
lair
in
the
passes
of
the
sierra
morena
if
he
had
lingered
any
longer
in
the
plains
he
would
have
been
destroyed
for
the
king
on
the
arrival
of
leval
s
and
merlin
s
divisions
would
have
fallen
upon
him
at
the
head
of
men
as
it
was
venegas
retired
with
such
promptitude
to
santa
cruz
de
mudela
at
the
foot
of
the
passes
that
the
french
could
never
catch
him
joseph
pursued
him
as
far
as
almagro
and
el
moral
on
the
southern
edge
of
la
mancha
and
there
stopped
short
he
had
received
on
july
a
dispatch
from
victor
to
the
effect
that
cuesta
had
repaired
the
bridge
of
almaraz
and
begun
to
cross
the
tagus
while
a
body
of
allied
troops
presumably
portuguese
had
been
heard
of
in
the
direction
of
plasencia
this
was
in
reality
the
whole
army
of
wellesley
rightly
concluding
that
he
had
pushed
the
pursuit
of
venegas
too
far
the
king
turned
back
in
haste
left
sebastiani
and
the
corps
behind
the
guadiana
and
returned
with
his
reserve
to
toledo
in
order
to
be
in
a
position
to
support
victor
his
excursion
to
almagro
had
been
almost
as
reckless
and
wrongheaded
as
venegas
s
advance
to
madridejos
for
he
had
separated
himself
from
victor
by
a
gap
of
miles
at
the
moment
when
the
british
army
was
just
appearing
on
the
marshal
s
flank
while
cuesta
was
in
his
front
if
the
allied
generals
had
concentrated
their
forces
ten
days
earlier
a
thing
that
might
well
have
happened
but
for
the
vexatious
delays
at
abrantes
caused
by
cuesta
s
impracticability
the
corps
might
have
been
attacked
at
the
moment
when
joseph
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
sierra
morena
in
a
position
too
remote
from
talavera
to
allow
him
to
come
up
in
time
to
succour
victor
for
all
this
see
joseph
to
napoleon
from
moral
july
and
from
almagro
july
while
the
king
was
absent
on
his
expedition
in
pursuit
of
venegas
the
most
important
change
in
the
situation
of
affairs
on
the
tagus
was
that
the
duke
of
belluno
had
drawn
back
his
troops
from
the
line
of
the
tagus
where
they
had
been
lying
since
june
and
had
retired
behind
the
alberche
his
retreat
was
not
caused
by
any
apprehension
as
to
the
appearance
of
wellesley
on
his
flank
a
fact
which
was
completely
concealed
from
him
but
by
sheer
want
of
provisions
on
june
he
sent
to
the
king
to
say
that
his
army
was
again
starved
out
of
its
cantonments
and
that
he
had
eaten
up
in
a
week
the
small
remnant
of
food
that
could
be
squeezed
out
of
the
between
the
tagus
and
the
tietar
and
was
forced
to
transfer
himself
to
another
region
the
position
he
wrote
is
desperate
the
corps
is
on
the
eve
of
dissolution
the
men
are
dropping
down
from
mere
starvation
i
have
nothing
absolutely
nothing
to
give
them
they
are
in
a
state
of
despair
i
am
forced
to
fall
back
on
talavera
where
there
are
no
more
resources
than
here
we
must
have
prompt
succour
but
where
can
it
be
found
if
your
majesty
abandons
me
in
my
present
wretched
situation
i
lose
my
honour
my
military
record
everything
i
shall
not
be
to
blame
for
the
disaster
which
menaces
my
troops
but
i
shall
have
to
bear
the
blame
tomorrow
i
shall
be
at
talavera
waiting
your
majesty
s
orders
the
enemy
cuesta
has
a
if
he
wishes
to
cross
the
tagus
he
can
do
so
for
the
corps
can
no
longer
remain
opposite
him
never
was
there
a
more
distressing
situation
than
ours
victor
to
king
joseph
from
the
head
quarters
of
the
corps
calzada
near
oropesa
june
intercepted
dispatch
in
the
record
office
on
june
therefore
victor
transferred
himself
to
talavera
and
adopted
a
position
behind
the
alberche
after
burning
the
materials
of
the
late
pontoon
bridge
at
almaraz
which
he
had
taken
up
and
stored
in
case
they
might
again
be
needed
his
movement
was
a
lucky
one
for
himself
as
it
took
him
further
away
from
wellesley
s
army
which
was
just
about
to
start
from
abrantes
with
the
object
of
turning
his
flank
it
puzzled
cuesta
who
sought
for
some
other
explanation
of
his
departure
than
mere
starvation
and
was
very
cautious
in
taking
advantage
of
it
however
on
the
day
after
the
french
had
withdrawn
he
pushed
troops
across
the
tagus
and
prepared
to
construct
another
bridge
at
almaraz
to
replace
that
which
the
french
had
destroyed
his
cavalry
pushed
out
to
navalmoral
and
oropesa
and
further
to
the
east
he
passed
some
detachments
of
infantry
across
the
bridge
of
arzobispo
which
victor
most
unaccountably
had
left
intact
fortunately
he
did
no
more
and
refrained
from
advancing
against
talavera
a
step
which
from
his
earlier
record
we
should
judge
that
he
might
well
have
taken
into
consideration
on
the
part
of
the
allies
things
were
now
in
a
state
of
suspense
from
which
they
were
not
to
stir
for
a
fortnight
cuesta
was
waiting
for
wellesley
wellesley
was
pushing
forward
from
zarza
la
mayor
to
join
cuesta
venegas
was
recovering
at
santa
cruz
de
mudela
from
the
fatigues
of
his
fruitless
expedition
into
la
mancha
but
on
the
french
side
matters
suffered
a
sudden
change
in
the
last
days
of
july
the
hand
of
the
emperor
was
stretched
out
from
the
banks
of
the
danube
to
alter
the
general
dispositions
of
the
army
of
spain
on
june
he
had
dictated
at
schönbrunn
a
new
plan
of
campaign
based
on
information
which
was
already
many
weeks
old
when
it
reached
him
at
this
date
the
emperor
was
barely
aware
that
soult
was
being
pressed
by
wellesley
in
northern
portugal
he
had
no
detailed
knowledge
of
what
was
taking
place
in
galicia
or
the
asturias
and
was
profoundly
ignorant
of
the
intrigues
at
oporto
which
afterwards
roused
his
indignation
but
he
was
convinced
that
the
english
army
was
the
one
hostile
force
in
spain
which
ought
to
engage
the
attention
of
his
lieutenants
acting
on
this
belief
he
issued
an
order
that
the
and
corps
those
of
soult
mortier
and
ney
were
to
be
united
into
a
single
army
and
to
be
told
off
to
the
task
of
evicting
wellesley
from
portugal
they
were
to
put
aside
for
the
present
all
such
subsidiary
enterprises
as
the
subjection
of
galicia
and
the
asturias
and
to
devote
themselves

the

if

the
enemy

then
the

from

june
this
dispatch
reached
king
joseph
at
el
moral
in
la
mancha
on
july
and
soult
at
zamora
on
july
it
had
been
drawn
up
in
view
of
events
that
were
taking
place
about
may
it
presupposed
that
the
british
army
was
still
in
northern
portugal
in
close
touch
with
soult
and
that
victor
was
in
estremadura
as
a
matter
of
fact
soult
was
on
this
day
leading
his
dilapidated
corps
down
the
esla
at
the
end
of
his
retreat
from
galicia
ney
furious
at
the
way
in
which
his
colleague
had
deserted
him
had
descended
to
astorga
three
days
before
mortier
was
at
valladolid
just
about
to
march
for
villacastin
and
madrid
for
the
king
had
determined
to
draw
him
down
to
aid
in
the
defence
of
the
capital
finally
cuesta
instead
of
lying
in
the
sierra
morena
as
he
was
when
napoleon
drew
up
his
orders
was
now
on
the
tagus
while
wellesley
was
no
longer
in
touch
with
soult
on
the
douro
but
preparing
to
fall
upon
victor
in
new
castile
the
whole
situation
was
so
changed
that
the
commentary
which
the
emperor
appended
to
his
orders
was
hopelessly
out
of
date
as
was
always
bound
to
be
the
case
so
long
as
he
persisted
in
endeavouring
to
direct
the
course
of
affairs
in
spain
from
the
suburbs
of
vienna
the
emperor
s
dispatch
contained
many
rebukes
to
victor
for
not
pushing
towards
the
north
to
join
hands
with
soult
jourdan
very
truly
remarks
that
if
the
corps
had
been
sent
in
that
direction
king
joseph
must
infallibly
have
lost
madrid
soult
was
overjoyed
at
receiving
the
splendid
charge
which
the
emperor
s
decree
put
into
his
hands
though
he
must
have
felt
secret
qualms
at
the
idea
that
ere
long
some
account
of
his
doings
at
oporto
must
reach
the
imperial
head
quarters
and
provoke
his
master
s
wrath
there
was
a
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
to
come
but
meanwhile
he
was
given
a
formidable
army
and
might
hope
to
retrieve
the
laurels
that
he
had
lost
in
portugal
being
now
in
a
position
to
attack
the
british
with
an
overwhelming
superiority
of
numbers
it
must
have
been
specially
delightful
to
him
to
find
that
ney
had
been
put
under
his
orders
so
that
he
would
be
able
to
meet
his
angry
colleague
in
the
character
of
a
superior
officer
dealing
with
an
insubordinate
lieutenant
the
emperor
s
stormy
dispatch
came
in
due
course
but
only
in
september
see
pp
soult
s
first
action
on
finding
himself
placed
in
command
of
the
whole
of
the
french
forces
in
spain
was
to
issue
orders
to
mortier
to
march
on
salamanca
and
to
ney
to
bring
the
corps
down
to
benavente
these
dispositions
clearly
indicate
an
intention
of
falling
upon
ciudad
rodrigo
and
almeida
and
assailing
northern
portugal
the
plan
which
the
duke
of
dalmatia
had
broached
to
the
king
in
his
letter
from
puebla
de
senabria
on
june
before
he
had
received
the
news
that
the
and
corps
had
been
added
to
his
command
it
is
clear
that
on
july
soult
had
no
knowledge
of
wellesley
s
movements
and
thought
that
the
british
army
was
quite
as
likely
to
be
aiming
at
salamanca
as
at
madrid
it
is
also
evident
that
he
was
aware
that
he
would
be
unable
to
move
for
some
weeks
till
the
corps
should
have
received
the
clothing
munitions
and
artillery
which
had
been
promised
it
it
could
not
possibly
take
the
field
for
the
invasion
of
portugal
soult
therefore
was
obliged
to
wait
till
his
stores
should
be
replenished
and
till
the
two
corps
from
astorga
and
valladolid
should
concentrate
on
his
flanks
it
was
while
he
was
remaining
perforce
in
this
posture
of
expectation
that
the
news
of
the
real
condition
of
affairs
in
new
castile
was
at
last
brought
to
him
section
xvi
chapter
iii
wellesley
and
cuesta
the
interview
at
mirabete
it
was
not
till
the
third
day
of
july
that
wellesley
had
been
able
to
cross
the
spanish
border
since
victor
had
assumed
his
new
position
to
the
north
of
the
tagus
as
early
as
the
nineteenth
of
the
preceding
month
there
was
a
perilous
fortnight
during
which
cuesta
and
his
army
were
left
alone
to
face
the
french
all
through
this
time
of
waiting
the
british
was
haunted
by
the
dread
that
the
old
might
repeat
his
earlier
errors
and
once
more
as
at
rio
seco
and
medellin
court
a
pitched
battle
wellesley
had
done
his
best
to
urge
caution
by
letters
written
not
only
to
cuesta
himself
but
to
his
o
donoju
and
to
colonel
roche
who
had
now
replaced
bourke
as
british
representative
at
the
head
quarters
of
the
army
of
estremadura
fortunately
they
were
not
needed
the
spanish
general
was
for
once
cautious
he
followed
victor
at
a
respectful
distance
and
when
he
had
reached
the
tagus
and
repaired
the
bridge
of
almaraz
held
back
his
army
to
the
southern
bank
and
only
pushed
a
few
small
detachments
beyond
the
stream
to
search
for
the
enemy
since
the
french
had
withdrawn
to
talavera
on
june
there
was
no
collision
the
cavalry
of
the
corps
were
discovered
upon
the
upper
tietar
and
the
alberche
but
they
preserved
a
defensive
attitude
and
the
spaniards
did
not
provoke
them
by
any
rash
attempt
to
drive
them
back
upon
their
main
body
all
remained
quiet
as
wellesley
had
rather
desired
than
expected
cuesta
s
strategical
position
therefore
was
perfectly
secure
since
he
kept
his
main
body
to
the
south
of
the
river
and
showed
no
desire
to
meddle
with
victor
before
the
arrival
of
the
british
at
this
moment
military
affairs
were
not
the
only
things
that
were
engaging
the
attention
of
the
old
he
was
watching
with
considerable
anxiety
the
course
of
events
at
seville
where
he
was
aware
that
he
had
many
enemies
ever
since
his
action
against
the
deputies
of
leon
in
the
preceding
autumn
he
knew
that
the
central
junta
and
especially
its
liberal
wing
viewed
him
with
suspicion
and
dislike
it
was
with
great
reluctance
that
they
had
placed
him
in
command
of
the
estremaduran
army
and
if
he
had
not
been
popular
with
the
conservative
and
clerical
party
and
with
some
of
the
military
cliques
he
would
not
have
retained
his
post
for
long
at
this
moment
there
were
many
intrigues
stirring
in
andalusia
and
if
some
of
them
were
directed
against
the
junta
others
had
no
other
end
than
the
changing
of
the
commanders
of
the
various
armies
while
the
junta
were
debating
about
forms
of
government
and
especially
about
the
summoning
of
a
national
cortes
in
the
autumn
there
were
a
number
of
officers
of
damaged
reputation
whose
main
object
was
to
recover
the
military
rank
of
which
they
had
been
deprived
after
misfortunes
in
the
field
infantado
who
thought
that
it
was
absurd
that
he
should
have
been
disgraced
after
ucles
while
cuesta
had
been
rewarded
after
medellin
was
at
the
head
of
one
party
of
intriguers
which
included
francisco
palafox
and
the
conde
de
montijo
and
had
secured
the
aid
of
colonel
doyle
late
british
agent
in
aragon
and
catalonia
an
officer
who
showed
a
lamentable
readiness
to
throw
himself
into
the
intestine
quarrels
of
the
spanish
factions
their
actions
went
to
the
very
edge
of
high
treason
for
montijo
stirred
up
a
riot
at
granada
on
april
attacked
the
provincial
authorities
and
almost
succeeded
in
carrying
out
a
which
must
have
led
to
civil
war
the
junta
did
no
more
than
banish
him
to
san
lucar
from
which
place
he
continued
his
plots
with
infantado
in
spite
of
the
warning
that
he
had
received
doyle
as
his
numerous
letters
in
the
record
office
show
was
such
a
furious
partisan
of
the
family
of
palafox
that
he
believed
that
all
the
spanish
authorities
were
in
a
conspiracy
to
keep
them
down
he
especially
hated
blake
in
seville
faction
if
not
so
openly
displayed
was
equally
violent
there
was
as
we
have
already
said
a
large
section
of
the
junta
whose
dearest
wish
would
have
been
to
displace
cuesta
it
was
they
who
had
obtained
the
nomination
of
venegas
to
take
charge
of
the
troops
in
la
mancha
merely
because
he
was
known
to
be
an
enemy
of
the
elder
general
yet
since
the
two
armies
would
have
to
in
any
attempt
to
recover
madrid
it
was
clearly
inexpedient
that
their
commanders
should
be
at
enmity
some
of
the
politicians
at
seville
were
set
on
giving
high
command
to
the
duke
of
albuquerque
an
energetic
and
ambitious
officer
but
one
gifted
with
the
talent
of
quarrelling
with
every
superior
under
whom
he
served
he
was
now
bickering
with
cuesta
just
as
in
march
he
had
bickered
with
cartaojal
the
duke
was
a
great
admirer
of
all
things
english
and
a
personal
friend
of
frere
the
british
minister
the
latter
did
his
best
to
support
his
pretensions
often
expressing
in
official
correspondence
with
the
junta
a
desire
that
albuquerque
might
be
given
an
independent
corps
and
entrusted
with
the
charge
of
the
movement
that
was
to
be
concerted
in
conjunction
with
wellesley
s
army
but
it
was
not
so
much
albuquerque
as
wellesley
himself
that
cuesta
dreaded
as
a
possible
successor
for
frere
was
possessed
with
the
notion
that
the
time
had
now
arrived
at
which
it
would
be
possible
to
press
for
the
appointment
of
a
single
of
all
the
spanish
armies
the
obvious
person
to
fill
this
post
was
the
victor
of
vimiero
and
oporto
if
only
spanish
pride
would
consent
to
the
appointment
of
a
foreigner
frere
had
sufficient
sense
to
refrain
from
openly
publishing
his
idea
but
he
was
continually
ventilating
it
to
his
private
friends
in
the
junta
in
season
and
out
of
season
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
both
from
the
military
and
the
political
point
of
view
the
results
of
wellesley
s
exaltation
to
the
position
of
generalissimo
would
have
been
excellent
if
he
had
controlled
the
whole
of
the
spanish
armies
in
the
summer
of
the
course
of
affairs
in
the
peninsula
would
have
taken
a
very
different
turn
and
the
campaign
of
talavera
would
not
have
been
wrecked
by
the
hopeless
want
of
between
the
allied
armies
but
it
was
not
yet
the
time
to
press
for
the
appointment
great
as
wellesley
s
reputation
already
was
when
compared
with
that
of
any
spanish
general
it
was
still
not
so
splendid
or
so
commanding
as
to
compel
assent
to
his
promotion
legitimate
national
pride
stood
in
the
way
and
even
after
espinosa
and
tudela
and
medellin
the
spaniards
could
not
believe
that
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
entrust
the
whole
responsibility
for
the
defence
of
their
country
to
the
foreigner
only
a
few
of
the
politicians
of
seville
showed
any
liking
for
the
project
wellesley
himself
would
have
desired
nothing
so
much
as
this
appointment
but
being
wiser
and
less
hopeful
than
frere
he
thought
it
useless
to
press
the
point
when
the
sanguine
diplomat
wrote
to
him
early
in
june
to
detail
his
attempts
to
bring
home
the
advisability
of
the
project
to
his
spanish
friends
the
general
s
reply
was
cautious
in
the
extreme
i
am
much
flattered
he
said
by
the
notion
entertained
by
some
of
the
persons
in
authority
at
seville
of
appointing
me
to
the
command
of
the
spanish
armies
i
have
received
no
instruction
from
government
upon
that
subject
but
i
believe
that
it
was
considered
an
object
of
great
importance
in
england
that
the
of
the
british
troops
should
have
that
situation
but
it
is
one
more
likely
to
be
attained
by
refraining
from
pressing
it
and
leaving
it
to
the
spanish
themselves
to
discover
the
expediency
of
the
arrangement
than
by
any
suggestion
on
our
he
concluded
by
informing
frere
that
he
could
not
conceive
that
his
insinuation
was
likely
to
have
any
effect
and
that
the
opinion
of
the
british
ministry
was
probably
correct
viz
that
at
present
national
jealousy
made
the
project
hopeless
on
june
frere
writes
to
tell
wellesley
that
if
he
could
only
have
destroyed
soult
at
oporto
instead
of
merely
chasing
him
across
the
frontier
it
would
have
been
possible
to
secure
him
the
post
of
generalissimo
at
once
this
chance
had
gone
by
but
your
friends
here
among
whom
you
may
count
de
garay
are
doing
their
best
for
record
office
from
seville
june
wellington
to
frere
from
abrantes
june
now
it
was
impossible
that
frere
s
but
mistaken
endeavours
should
escape
the
notice
of
cuesta
s
friends
in
seville
the
british
minister
had
spoken
to
so
many
politicians
on
the
subject
that
we
can
not
doubt
that
his
colloquies
were
promptly
reported
to
the
of
estremadura
this
fact
goes
far
to
explain
cuesta
s
surly
and
impracticable
behaviour
towards
wellesley
during
the
talavera
campaign
he
disliked
his
destined
colleague
not
only
because
he
was
a
foreigner
and
because
he
showed
himself
and
outspoken
during
their
intercourse
but
because
he
believed
that
the
englishman
was
intriguing
behind
his
back
to
obtain
the
post
of
generalissimo
this
belief
made
him
determined
to
assert
his
independence
on
the
most
trifling
matters
loth
to
fall
in
with
even
the
most
reasonable
plans
and
suspicious
that
every
proposal
made
to
him
concealed
some
trap
he
attributed
to
wellesley
the
design
of
getting
rid
of
him
and
was
naturally
determined
to
do
nothing
to
forward
it
the
english
officers
who
studied
cuesta
s
conduct
from
the
outside
during
the
talavera
campaign
attributed
his
irrational
movements
and
his
hopeless
impracticability
to
a
mere
mixture
of
pride
stupidity
and
obstinacy
they
were
wrong
the
dominant
impulse
was
resentment
jealousy
and
suspicion
a
combination
far
more
deadly
in
its
results
than
the
other
he
awaited
the
approach
of
wellesley
with
a
predisposition
to
quarrel
and
a
personal
enmity
whose
existence
the
british
general
had
not
yet
realized
we
have
dealt
in
the
last
chapter
with
the
strength
and
organization
of
the
british
army
at
the
moment
when
wellesley
crossed
the
frontier
on
july
it
remains
to
speak
of
the
two
spanish
armies
which
were
to
take
part
in
the
campaign
we
have
already
seen
that
cuesta
s
host
had
been
reinforced
after
medellin
with
a
new
brigade
of
granadan
levies
and
a
whole
division
taken
from
the
army
of
la
mancha
since
that
date
he
had
received
large
drafts
both
of
infantry
and
cavalry
from
andalusia
six
more
regiments
of
horse
had
reached
him
besides
reinforcements
for
his
old
corps
all
were
now
strong
in
numbers
and
averaged
between
and
sabres
so
that
by
the
middle
of
june
he
had
fully
mounted
men
under
his
orders
eight
or
nine
additional
regiments
of
infantry
had
also
come
to
hand
since
april
some
of
them
new
andalusian
levies
others
old
corps
whose
had
been
filled
up
since
the
disaster
of
ucles
his
infantry
counted
about
bayonets
divided
into
five
divisions
and
a
vanguard
the
latter
under
zayas
was
about
strong
each
of
the
others
exceeded
the
cavalry
formed
two
divisions
under
henestrosa
and
albuquerque
one
composed
of
seven
one
of
six
regiments
there
were
thirty
guns
some
of
heavy
calibre
with
about
artillerymen
the
whole
army
inclusive
of
sick
and
detached
amounted
to
men
of
whom
perhaps
were
efficients
present
with
the
colours
i
can
nowhere
find
the
date
of
the
transference
but
it
took
place
before
july
the
old
regiments
of
calatrava
sagunto
alcantara
and
pavia
which
were
with
venegas
s
army
in
march
had
been
transferred
to
cuesta
s
by
june
as
also
the
new
regiments
of
sevilla
and
cazadores
de
madrid
my
most
valuable
source
of
information
is
an
unpublished
dispatch
of
cuesta
s
in
the
madrid
war
office
which
gives
all
the
names
of
regiments
but
not
their
numbers
these
totals
may
be
regarded
as
certain
being
drawn
from
the
dispatch
of
cuesta
s
alluded
to
above
which
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
at
madrid
unfortunately
no
regimental
figures
are
given
only
the
gross
total
the
second
spanish
army
that
of
la
mancha
under
venegas
was
much
weaker
having
furnished
heavy
detachments
to
reinforce
cuesta
before
it
took
the
field
in
june
its
base
was
the
old
army
of
the
centre
which
had
been
commanded
by
castaños
and
infantado
some
twenty
battalions
that
had
seen
service
in
the
campaign
of
tudela
were
still
in
its
ranks
they
had
been
recruited
up
to
an
average
of
or
bayonets
the
rest
of
the
force
was
composed
of
new
andalusian
regiments
raised
in
the
winter
and
spring
some
of
which
had
taken
part
in
the
rout
of
ciudad
real
under
cartaojal
while
others
had
never
before
entered
the
field
the
gross
total
of
the
army
on
june
was
men
of
whom
were
cavalry
deducting
the
sick
in
hospital
venegas
could
dispose
of
some
sabres
and
bayonets
distributed
into
five
divisions
the
horsemen
in
this
army
were
not
formed
into
separate
brigades
but
allotted
as
divisional
cavalry
to
the
infantry
units
there
was
little
to
choose
in
point
of
efficiency
between
the
estremaduran
army
and
that
of
la
mancha
both
contained
too
many
raw
troops
and
in
both
as
was
soon
to
be
proved
the
bulk
of
the
cavalry
was
still
as
untrustworthy
as
it
had
shown
itself
in
previous
engagements
the
spaniards
therefore
could
put
into
the
field
for
the
campaign
of
july
on
the
tagus
some
men
but
the
fatal
want
of
unity
in
command
was
to
prevent
them
from
their
movements
and
acting
as
integral
parts
of
a
single
army
guided
by
a
single
will
venegas
was
to
a
certain
degree
supposed
to
be
under
cuesta
s
authority
but
as
he
was
continually
receiving
orders
directly
from
the
junta
and
was
treated
by
them
as
an
independent
commander
he
practically
was
enabled
to
do
much
as
he
pleased
being
a
personal
enemy
of
cuesta
he
had
every
inducement
to
play
his
own
game
and
did
not
scruple
to
do
so
at
the
most
important
crisis
of
the
campaign
covering
his
disregard
of
the
directions
of
his
senior
by
the
easy
pretext
of
a
desire
to
execute
those
of
the
central
government
on
july
the
day
when
his
share
in
the
campaign
commenced
the
head
quarters
of
venegas
were
at
santa
cruz
de
mudela
just
outside
the
northern
exit
of
the
despeña
perros
his
outposts
lay
in
front
at
el
moral
valdepeñas
and
villanueva
de
los
infantes
he
was
divided
by
a
considerable
distance
some
miles
from
the
advanced
cavalry
of
sebastiani
s
corps
whose
nearest
detachment
was
placed
at
villaharta
where
the
to
madrid
crosses
the
river
giguela
meanwhile
we
must
return
to
wellesley
who
having
crossed
the
frontier
on
july
was
now
moving
forward
by
short
marches
to
plasencia
on
the
fourth
the
head
quarters
were
at
zarza
la
mayor
on
the
sixth
at
coria
on
the
seventh
at
galisteo
on
the
eighth
plasencia
was
reached
and
the
general
halted
the
army
while
he
should
ride
over
to
almaraz
and
confer
in
person
with
cuesta
on
the
details
of
their
plan
of
campaign
in
the
valley
of
the
alagon
where
the
country
was
almost
untouched
by
the
hand
of
war
provisions
were
obtainable
in
some
quantity
but
every
spanish
informant
agreed
that
when
the
troops
dropped
down
to
the
tagus
they
would
find
the
land
completely
devastated
wellesley
was
therefore
most
anxious
to
organize
a
great
dépôt
of
food
before
moving
on
the
local
authorities
professed
great
readiness
to
supply
him
and
he
contracted
with
the
alcaldes
of
the
fertile
vera
de
plasencia
for
rations
of
flour
to
be
delivered
during
the
next
ten
days
lozano
de
torres
the
spanish
sent
by
the
junta
to
the
british
head
quarters
promised
his
aid
in
collecting
the
food
but
even
before
wellesley
departed
to
visit
cuesta
he
had
begun
to
conceive
doubts
whether
supplies
would
be
easily
procurable
the
difficulty
was
want
of
transport
the
army
had
marched
from
portugal
with
a
light
equipment
and
had
no
carts
to
spare
for
scouring
the
in
search
of
flour
the
general
had
relied
on
the
assurances
sent
him
from
seville
to
the
effect
that
he
would
easily
be
able
to
find
local
transport
in
the
intact
regions
about
coria
and
plasencia
but
he
was
disappointed
very
few
carts
could
be
secured
and
the
store
of
food
in
the
possession
of
the
army
seemed
to
shrink
rather
than
to
increase
during
every
day
that
the
army
remained
in
the
valley
of
the
alagon
though
the
region
was
fruitful
and
undevastated
it
is
certain
that
the
british
commissaries
had
not
yet
mastered
the
art
of
gathering
in
provisions
from
the
and
that
the
spanish
local
authorities
could
not
be
made
to
understand
the
necessity
for
punctuality
and
dispatch
in
the
delivery
of
the
promised
supplies
wellesley
to
frere
iv
on
july
wellesley
started
off
with
the
staff
to
visit
cuesta
at
his
camp
beyond
the
bridge
of
almaraz
there
to
concert
the
details
of
their
joint
advance
owing
to
an
error
made
by
his
guides
he
arrived
after
dusk
at
the
hamlet
below
the
puerto
de
mirabete
around
which
the
main
body
of
the
army
of
estremadura
was
encamped
the
had
drawn
out
his
troops
in
the
afternoon
for
the
inspection
of
the
british
commander
when
at
last
he
appeared
they
had
been
four
hours
under
arms
in
momentary
expectation
of
the
arrival
of
their
distinguished
visitor
and
cuesta
himself
though
still
lame
from
the
effect
of
his
bruises
at
medellin
had
sat
on
horseback
at
their
head
during
the
greater
part
of
that
time
two
admirable
accounts
of
the
review
of
the
estremaduran
host
in
the
darkness
were
written
by
members
of
wellesley
s
staff
it
is
well
worth
while
to
quote
one
of
them
for
the
narrative
expresses
with
perfect
clearness
the
effect
which
the
sight
of
the
spanish
troops
made
upon
their
allies
that
of
charles
stewart
lord
londonderry
on
pp
of
the
first
volume
of
his
of
the
peninsular
our
arrival
at
the
camp
was
announced
by
a
general
discharge
of
artillery
upon
which
an
immense
number
of
torches
were
made
to
blaze
up
and
we
passed
the
entire
spanish
line
in
review
by
their
light
the
effect
produced
by
these
arrangements
was
one
of
no
ordinary
character
the
torches
held
aloft
at
moderate
intervals
threw
a
red
and
wavering
light
over
the
whole
scene
permitting
at
the
same
time
its
minuter
parts
to
be
here
and
there
cast
into
the
shade
while
the
grim
and
swarthy
visages
of
the
soldiers
their
bright
arms
and
dark
uniforms
appeared
peculiarly
picturesque
as
often
as
the
flashes
fell
upon
them
nor
was
cuesta
himself
an
object
to
be
passed
by
without
notice
the
old
man
preceded
us
not
so
much
sitting
upon
his
horse
as
held
upon
it
by
two
pages
at
the
imminent
risk
of
being
overthrown
whenever
a
cannon
was
discharged
or
a
torch
flamed
out
with
peculiar
brightness
his
physical
debility
was
so
observable
as
clearly
to
mark
his
unfitness
for
the
situation
which
he
held
as
to
his
mental
powers
he
gave
us
little
opportunity
of
judging
inasmuch
as
he
scarcely
uttered
five
words
during
the
continuance
of
our
visit
but
his
corporal
infirmities
were
ever
at
absolute
variance
with
all
a
general
s
duties
in
this
way
we
passed
by
about
cavalry
drawn
up
in
rank
entire
and
not
less
than
twenty
battalions
of
infantry
each
of
to
bayonets
they
were
all
without
exception
remarkably
fine
men
some
indeed
were
very
young
too
young
for
service
particularly
among
the
recruits
who
had
lately
joined
but
to
take
them
all
in
all
it
would
not
have
been
easy
to
find
a
stouter
or
more
hardy
looking
body
of
soldiers
in
any
european
service
of
their
appointments
it
was
not
possible
to
speak
in
the
same
terms
of
commendation
there
were
battalions
whose
arms
accoutrements
and
even
clothing
might
be
pronounced
respectable
but
in
general
they
were
deficient
particularly
in
shoes
it
was
easy
to
perceive
from
the
attitude
in
which
they
stood
and
the
manner
in
which
they
handled
their
arms
that
little
or
no
discipline
prevailed
among
them
they
could
not
but
be
regarded
as
raw
levies
speaking
of
them
in
the
aggregate
they
were
little
better
than
bold
peasantry
armed
partially
like
soldiers
but
completely
unacquainted
with
a
soldier
s
duty
this
remark
applied
to
the
cavalry
as
much
as
to
the
infantry
many
of
the
horses
were
good
but
the
riders
manifestly
knew
nothing
of
movement
or
of
discipline
and
they
were
on
this
account
as
also
on
that
of
miserable
equipment
quite
unfit
for
service
the
generals
appeared
to
have
been
selected
by
one
rule
alone
that
of
seniority
they
were
almost
all
old
men
and
except
o
donoju
and
zayas
evidently
incapable
of
bearing
the
fatigues
or
surmounting
the
difficulties
of
a
campaign
it
was
not
so
with
the
colonels
and
battalion
commanders
who
appeared
to
be
young
and
active
and
some
of
whom
were
we
had
reason
to
believe
learning
to
become
skilful
officers
cuesta
seemed
particularly
unwilling
that
any
of
his
generals
should
hold
any
serious
conversation
with
us
it
is
true
that
he
presented
them
one
by
one
to
sir
arthur
but
no
words
were
exchanged
on
the
occasion
and
each
retired
after
he
had
made
his
albuquerque
of
whom
the
was
particularly
jealous
had
been
relegated
with
his
division
to
arzobispo
and
did
not
appear
on
the
scene
as
to
the
equipment
of
the
spaniards
the
following
quotation
from
leslie
may
be
worth
giving
their
uniforms
were
of
every
variety
of
colour
the
equipment
and
appointments
of
the
most
inferior
description
one
could
not
but
lament
these
defects
for
the
men
were
remarkably
fine
possessing
all
the
essential
qualities
to
make
good
soldiers
courage
patience
and
soberness
their
officers
in
general
were
the
very
reverse
the
line
infantry
were
in
blue
uniforms
with
red
facings
the
provincial
corps
called
volunteers
were
mostly
dressed
in
the
brown
spanish
cloth
of
the
country
with
green
or
yellow
facings
some
had
chakoes
others
hats
with
the
rim
turned
up
at
one
side
all
had
of
tin
announcing
their
designation
some
had
belts
others
none
they
had
no
pouches
but
a
broad
belt
of
soft
leather
in
which
were
placed
a
row
of
tin
tubes
each
holding
a
cartridge
with
a
fold
of
leather
to
cover
them
fastened
round
the
waist
the
cavalry
were
heavy
and
light
dragoons
with
some
regiments
of
hussars
some
were
tolerably
well
dressed
in
blue
or
yellow
uniforms
with
red
facings
some
had
boots
but
more
long
leather
leggings
coming
up
above
the
knee
the
horses
were
small
active
and
hardy
of
the
spanish
barbary
the
plan
of
campaign
was
settled
at
a
long
conference
it
lasted
for
four
hours
on
the
morning
of
the
following
day
according
to
all
accounts
the
scene
at
the
interview
must
have
been
curious
cuesta
could
not
or
would
not
speak
french
wellesley
was
not
yet
able
to
express
himself
fluently
in
spanish
accordingly
o
donoju
the
chief
of
the
staff
of
the
army
of
estremadura
acted
as
interpreter
between
them
rendering
wellesley
s
views
into
spanish
and
cuesta
s
into
english
the
greater
part
of
the
discussion
consisted
in
the
bringing
forward
of
plans
by
the
british
commander
and
their
rejection
by
the
cuesta
was
full
of
suspicion
and
saw
a
trap
in
every
proposal
that
was
made
to
him
he
imagined
that
wellesley
s
main
object
was
to
edge
him
out
of
the
supreme
command
he
was
almost
silent
throughout
the
interview
only
opening
his
lips
to
give
emphatic
negatives
for
which
o
donoju
proceeded
to
find
ingenious
and
elaborate
explanations
it
was
not
the
principles
on
which
the
campaign
was
to
be
conducted
but
the
details
of
the
distribution
of
the
troops
on
which
the
trouble
arose
the
enemy
s
position
and
force
was
fairly
well
known
to
both
generals
except
in
one
particular
they
were
aware
that
victor
lay
behind
the
alberche
with
not
much
more
than
men
that
sebastiani
was
at
madridejos
with
a
somewhat
smaller
force
and
that
king
joseph
with
his
central
reserve
which
they
at
men
was
able
at
any
moment
to
join
the
corps
hence
they
expected
to
find
some
french
troops
at
talavera
and
rightly
considered
that
with
the
men
of
their
two
armies
they
ought
to
give
a
good
account
of
them
sebastiani
as
they
supposed
might
be
left
out
of
the
game
for
occupation
for
him
would
be
found
by
the
army
of
la
mancha
which
was
to
be
told
off
for
this
purpose
and
directed
to
cling
to
the
skirts
of
the
corps
and
never
to
lose
sight
of
it
as
venegas
would
have
according
to
their
calculations
nearly
double
the
numbers
of
sebastiani
he
would
have
no
difficulty
in
keeping
him
in
check
they
estimated
him
at
only
men
but
he
had
really
wellesley
to
castlereagh
july
from
plasencia
but
it
was
not
only
on
the
french
troops
in
new
castile
that
watch
had
to
be
kept
it
was
necessary
to
take
into
account
the
enemy
beyond
the
mountains
in
the
valley
of
the
douro
the
allied
generals
were
aware
that
mortier
and
soult
must
both
be
considered
the
former
they
knew
to
be
at
valladolid
and
they
had
learnt
that
king
joseph
was
proposing
to
bring
him
down
towards
madrid
as
was
indeed
the
fact
accordingly
they
expected
that
he
might
turn
up
in
a
few
days
somewhere
in
the
direction
of
avila
soult
they
knew
to
be
at
zamora
and
from
the
dispatches
captured
with
general
franceschi
ten
days
before
they
had
a
good
knowledge
of
his
force
and
intentions
a
study
of
these
documents
led
them
to
conclude
that
he
could
not
move
for
many
weeks
owing
to
the
dilapidated
state
of
his
corps
which
he
had
painted
in
the
most
moving
terms
in
his
letters
to
king
joseph
they
also
gathered
that
if
he
moved
at
all
he
would
be
inclined
to
threaten
northern
portugal
or
ciudad
rodrigo
in
the
dispatches
captured
with
franceschi
he
had
named
braganza
as
a
point
at
which
he
might
strike
accordingly
they
opined
that
he
need
not
be
taken
very
seriously
into
consideration
especially
as
he
was
wholly
destitute
of
artillery
yet
he
might
be
drawn
into
the
field
by
the
news
that
madrid
was
in
danger
if
he
were
induced
to
bring
help
to
the
king
he
would
almost
certainly
work
by
making
a
diversion
against
the
communications
of
the
british
army
and
not
by
directly
joining
himself
to
joseph
s
army
by
the
long
and
circuitous
march
from
zamora
to
madrid
to
carry
out
such
a
diversion
he
would
be
obliged
to
cross
the
lofty
sierra
de
francia
by
one
of
the
passes
which
lead
from
the
salamanca
region
into
the
valley
of
the
alagon
perhaps
by
the
defile
of
perales
but
much
more
probably
by
the
better
known
and
more
practicable
pass
of
baños
wellesley
took
the
possibility
of
this
movement
into
serious
consideration
but
did
not
think
that
it
would
be
likely
to
cause
him
much
danger
if
it
should
occur
for
he
believed
that
soult
would
bring
with
him
no
more
than
the
or
men
of
his
own
corps
that
he
would
appear
not
with
such
a
small
force
but
with
ney
and
mortier
in
his
wake
leading
an
army
of
bayonets
did
not
enter
into
the
mind
of
the
british
commander
mortier
was
thought
to
be
moving
in
the
direction
of
avila
ney
was
believed
to
be
contending
with
the
galician
insurgents
in
the
remote
regions
about
lugo
and
corunna
the
news
of
his
arrival
at
astorga
had
not
yet
reached
the
allied
camps
and
he
was
neglected
as
a
factor
in
the
situation
wellesley
and
cuesta
had
no
conception
that
any
force
save
that
of
soult
was
likely
to
menace
their
northern
flank
and
their
line
of
communications
when
they
committed
themselves
to
their
advance
on
madrid
to
provide
against
a
possible
movement
of
the
corps
into
the
valley
of
the
tagus
therefore
all
that
was
necessary
was
to
hold
the
defiles
of
perales
and
baños
the
former
had
already
been
seen
to
for
even
before
the
meeting
of
wellesley
and
cuesta
carlos
d
españa
had
blocked
it
with
two
or
three
battalions
drawn
from
the
garrison
of
ciudad
rodrigo
for
the
latter
wellesley
hoped
that
cuesta
would
provide
a
sufficient
garrison
the
old
promised
to
do
so
but
only
sent
men
under
the
marquis
del

a
wholly
inadequate

wellesley
s
views
at
this
moment
appear
in
his
correspondence
to
villiers
july
i
defy
soult
to
do
beresford
or
portugal
any
injury
as
long
as
his
army
is
in
its
present
situation
or
any
amelioration
of
that
situation
which
can
be
produced
in
a
short
period
of
to
beresford
july
i
have
no
apprehension
that
soult
will
be
able
to
do
anything
with
his
corps
for
some
time
but
i
think
that
column
ought
to
be
to
beresford
july
i
do
not
believe
that
ney
has
quitted
galicia
at
least
we
have
not
heard
that
he
has
soult
can
do
nothing
against
portugal
for
he
is
in
a
most
miserable
state
without
arms
artillery
or
ammunition
stores
wellesley
to
beresford
july
i
have
not
forgotten
either
the
puerto
de
baños
or
the
puerto
de
perales
and
have
called
upon
cuesta
to
occupy
both
the
former
is
already
held
and
the
latter
will
be
so
in
a
day
or
this
was
unfortunately
not
to
be
the
case
i
can
not
discover
the
names
of
the
two
very
weak
battalions
the
smallest
in
cuesta
s
army
which
were
detached
for
this
purpose
under
del
reino
they
are
the
same
as
the
two
battalions
which
joined
wilson
merida
and
of
seville
wellesley
s
first
proposal
to
his
spanish
colleague
was
that
the
main
bodies
of
both
armies
should
advance
against
victor
while
a
detachment
of
men
should
move
out
to
the
left
in
the
direction
of
avila
to
look
for
mortier
if
he
were
to
be
found
in
that
direction
and
if
not
to
turn
the
enemy
s
right
and
threaten
madrid
he
hoped
that
venegas
and
the
army
of
la
mancha
might
at
the
same
time
move
forward
against
sebastiani
and
keep
him
so
fully
employed
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
spare
a
man
to
aid
victor
and
king
joseph
cuesta
at
once
refused
to
make
any
detachment
in
the
direction
of
avila
from
his
own
army
and
suggested
that
wellesley
should
find
the
men
required
for
this
diversion
the
english
general
objected
that
it
would
take
exactly
half
his
force
and
that
he
could
not
split
up
such
a
small
unit
while
the
spaniards
could
easily
spare
such
a
number
of
troops
from
their
total
of
men
this
argument
failed
to
move
cuesta
and
the
project
was
dropped
wellesley
thinking
that
it
was
not
strictly
necessary
though
very
advisable
wellesley
to
frere
july
you
will
see
in
the
accompanying
letter
an
account
of
my
endeavour
to
prevail
on
general
cuesta
to
make
a
detachment
upon
avila
i
agree
with
you
that
it
would
be
a
great
advantage
from
a
military
point
of
view
but
i
must
at
the
same
time
inform
you
that
i
do
not
consider
the
movement
to
be
as
a
military
frere
and
wellesley
had
hoped
that
albuquerque
might
be
placed
in
command
of
this
large
detachment
and
might
distinguish
himself
at
its
head
the
only
flanking
force
which
was
finally
set
aside
for
operations
on
the
left
wing
for
the
observation
of
the
french
about
avila
and
the
feint
at
madrid
consisted
of
sir
robert
wilson
s
portuguese
and
a
corresponding
body
of
two
battalions
and
one
squadron
from
the
spanish
army
about
men
in
all
it
played
a
part
of
some
little
importance
in
the
campaign
but
it
is
hard
to
see
that
it
would
have
exercised
any
dominant
influence
even
if
it
had
been
raised
to
the
full
strength
that
wellesley
had
desired
mortier
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
not
near
avila
and
so
the
men
sent
in
this
direction
would
not
have
served
the
end
that
the
british
general
expected
the
corps
had
been
called
off
by
soult
contrary
to
the
wishes
of
the
king
and
no
body
of
troops
was
needed
to
contain
it
on
this
part
of
the
theatre
of
war
it
was
ultimately
to
appear
at
a
very
different
point
where
no
provision
had
been
made
for
its
reception
battalions
of
merida
bayonets
and
of
seville
bayonets
far
more
important
were
the
arrangements
which
wellesley
and
cuesta
made
for
the
diversion
on
their
other
flank
it
was
from
the
miscarriage
of
this
operation
owing
to
the
wilful
disobedience
of
the
officer
charged
with
it
that
the
failure
of
the
whole
campaign
was
to
come
about
they
agreed
that
venegas
with
the
men
of
the
army
of
la
mancha
was
to
move
up
the
from
his
position
at
santa
cruz
de
mudela
and
drive
sebastiani
before
him
having
pushed
back
the
corps
to
the
tagus
venegas
was
then
to
endeavour
to
force
the
passage
of
that
river
either
at
aranjuez
or
at
fuentedueñas
and
to
threaten
madrid
it
was
calculated
that
sebastiani
would
be
forced
to
keep
between
him
and
the
capital
and
would
be
unable
to
spare
a
man
to
reinforce
victor
and
king
joseph
thus
wellesley
and
cuesta
with
men
would
close
on
the
king
and
the
marshal
who
could
not
have
more
than
and
as
it
was
hoped
defeat
them
or
at
least
manœuvre
them
out
of
madrid
a
glance
at
the
map
will
show
one
peculiarity
of
this
plan
it
would
have
been
more
natural
to
bid
venegas
march
by
the
bridge
of
toledo
rather
than
by
those
of
aranjuez
and
fuentedueñas
to
use
the
latter
he
would
have
to
move
towards
his
right
and
to
separate
himself
by
a
long
gap
from
the
main
army
of
the
allies
at
toledo
he
would
be
within
miles
of
them
at
aranjuez
seventy
at
fuentedueñas
miles
would
lie
between
him
and
the
troops
of
wellesley
and
cuesta
it
would
appear
that
the
two
generals
at
their
colloquy
came
to
the
conclusion
that
by
ordering
venegas
to
use
the
eastern
passages
of
the
tagus
they
would
compel
sebastiani
to
remove
eastward
also
so
that
he
would
be
out
of
supporting
distance
of
victor
they
recognized
the
bare
possibility
that
sebastiani
might
refuse
to
devote
himself
to
the
task
of
holding
back
the
army
of
la
mancha
might
leave
madrid
to
its
fate
and
then
hurry
off
to
join
the
king
and
the
corps
in
an
assault
on
the
main
army
in
this
case
they
settled
that
venegas
should
march
on
the
capital
and
seize
it
a
move
which
as
they
supposed
would
force
joseph
to
turn
back
or
to
his
army
but
it
is
clear
that
they
did
not
expect
to
have
to
fight
victor
the
king
and
sebastiani
combined
as
they
were
ultimately
forced
to
do
at
talavera
on
july
they
supposed
that
venegas
would
find
occupation
for
the
corps
and
that
they
might
count
on
finding
only
the
corps
and
joseph
s
madrid
reserves
in
front
of
them
all
these
details
as
to
the
joint
plan
are
better
expressed
in
cuesta
s
apologetic
published
after
his
resignation
than
in
wellesley
s
to
castlereagh
and
frere
when
armies
are
working
in
a
joint
operation
from
separate
bases
it
is
that
they
should
time
their
movements
with
the
nicest
exactitude
this
wellesley
and
cuesta
attempted
to
secure
by
sending
to
venegas
an
elaborate
he
was
ordered
to
be
at
madridejos
on
july
at
tembleque
on
the
twentieth
at
santa
cruz
de
la
zarza
on
the
and
at
the
bridge
of
fuentedueñas
on
the
or
all
this
was
on
the
supposition
that
sebastiani
would
have
about
men
and
would
give
ground
whenever
pressed
if
he
turned
out
by
some
unlikely
chance
presumably
by
having
rallied
the
king
s
reserves
to
be
much
stronger
venegas
was
to
manœuvre
in
the
direction
of
tarancon
to
avoid
a
general
action
and
if
necessary
to
retreat
towards
the
passes
from
which
he
had
started
it
would
be
rather
an
advantage
than
otherwise
if
contrary
to
all
probability
the
french
had
concentrated
their
main
force
against
the
army
of
la
mancha
for
this
would
leave
victor
helpless
in
front
of
the
united
hosts
of
wellesley
and
cuesta
which
would
outnumber
him
by
two
to
one
illustration
spanish
coins
of
the
period
of
the
peninsular
war
what
the
allied
generals
never
expected
was
that
venegas
would
let
sebastiani
slip
away
from
his
front
without
any
attempt
to
hold
him
and
would
then
instead
of
marching
on
madrid
waste
the
critical
days
of
the
campaign
july
in
miserable
delays
between
toledo
and
aranjuez
when
there
was
absolutely
no
french
between
him
and
madrid
nor
any
hostile
troops
whatever
in
his
neighbourhood
save
a
weak
division
of
men
in
garrison
at
toledo
the
failure
of
the
talavera
campaign
is
due
even
more
to
this
wretched
indecision
and
disobedience
to
orders
on
the
part
of
venegas
than
to
the
eccentricities
and
errors
of
cuesta
if
the
army
of
la
mancha
had
kept
sebastiani
in
check
and
refused
to
allow
him
to
abscond
there
would
have
been
no
battles
on
the
alberche
on
july
for
the
french
would
never
have
dared
to
face
the
of
the
main
host
without
the
assistance
of
the
corps
but
to
return
to
the
joint
plan
of
wellesley
and
cuesta
on
july
the
day
on
which
venegas
was
to
reach
fuentedueñas
or
aranjuez
the
men
of
the
grand
army
were
to
be
assailing
victor
behind
the
alberche
the
british
were
to
cross
the
tietar
at
bazagona
on
the
eighteenth
and
follow
the
the
estremadurans
passing
the
tagus
at
almaraz
and
arzobispo
were
to
move
by
the
parallel
route
along
the
river
bank
by
la
calzada
and
calera
which
is
only
five
or
six
miles
distant
from
the
great
thus
the
two
armies
would
be
in
close
touch
with
each
other
and
would
not
be
caught
apart
by
the
enemy
on
reaching
talavera
they
were
to
force
the
fords
of
the
alberche
and
fall
upon
victor
in
his
cantonments
behind
that
stream
sir
robert
wilson
and
the
men
of
his
mixed
spanish
and
portuguese
detachment
were
to
move
up
as
the
of
the
allied
host
and
to
push
by
the
head
waters
of
the
tietar
for
escalona
on
the
to
madrid
cuesta
s
and
wellesley
s
accounts
of
their
joint
plan
on
the
whole
agree
wonderfully
well
criticisms
of
the
most
acrimonious
kind
have
been
brought
to
bear
on
this
plan
by
english
french
and
spanish
writers
many
of
them
are
undeserved
in
particular
the
tritest
objection
of
all
made
post
by
those
who
only
look
at
the
actual
course
of
the
campaign
that
wellesley
was
exposing
his
communications
to
the
united
forces
of
soult
ney
and
mortier
there
was
on
july
when
cuesta
and
wellesley
met
no
reason
whatever
for
apprehending
the
contingency
of
the
march
of
the
three
marshals
upon
plasencia
soult
as
his
own
letters
of
june
bore
witness
was
not
in
a
condition
to
move
he
had
not
a
single
piece
of
artillery
and
his
troops
were
in
dire
need
of
rest
and
ney
was
believed
to
be
at
corunna
or
lugo
soult
s
intercepted
dispatches
spoke
of
the
corps
as
being
destined
to
remain
behind
in
galicia
and
he
as
the
allied
generals
supposed
ought
best
to
have
known
what
his
colleague
was
about
to
do
how
could
they
have
guessed
that
in
wrath
at
his
desertion
by
the
duke
of
dalmatia
ney
would
evacuate
the
whole
kingdom
abandon
fortresses
like
ferrol
and
corunna
and
march
for
astorga
without
ney
s
corps
to
aid
him
soult
could
not
possibly
have
marched
on
plasencia
to
have
done
so
with
the
corps
alone
would
have
exposed
him
to
being
beset
by
wellesley
on
one
side
and
by
beresford
on
the
other
as
to
mortier
and
the
corps
cuesta
and
wellesley
undervalued
their
strength
being
unaware
that
kellermann
had
sent
back
from
the
asturias
the
division
that
had
been
lent
him
for
his
expedition
to
oviedo
they
thought
that
the
duke
of
treviso
s
force
was
more
like
than
bayonets
and
such
as
it
was
they
had
the
best
of
reasons
for
believing
that
it
was
more
likely
to
march
on
madrid
by
avila
than
to
join
soult
for
they
had
before
them
an
intercepted
dispatch
from
the
king
bidding
mortier
to
move
down
to
villacastin
in
order
to
be
in
supporting
distance
of
the
capital
and
the
corps
on
the
whole
therefore
the
two
generals
must
be
excused
for
not
foreseeing
the
descent
of
men
upon
their
communications
which
took
place
three
weeks
after
their
meeting
at
the
bridge
of
almaraz
the
data
in
their
possession
on
july
made
it
appear
most
improbable
a
much
more
valid
criticism
is
that
which
blames
the
method
of
with
venegas
which
was
employed
double
external
lines
of
operations
against
an
enemy
placed
in
a
central
position
are
notoriously
perilous
and
the
particular
movement
on
fuentedueñas
which
the
army
of
la
mancha
was
ordered
to
execute
was
one
which
took
it
as
far
as
possible
from
wellesley
s
and
cuesta
s
main
body
yet
it
may
be
urged
in
their
defence
that
if
they
had
drawn
in
venegas
to
join
them
they
would
have
got
little
profit
out
of
having
more
spaniards
on
the
alberche
sebastiani
on
the
other
hand
who
could
join
victor
at
the
same
moment
that
the
corps
from
la
mancha
joined
the
allies
would
bring
some
excellent
troops
to
talavera
the
benefit
of
drawing
in
venegas
would
be
much
less
than
the
disadvantage
of
drawing
in
sebastiani
to
the
main
theatre
of
war
hence
came
the
idea
that
the
army
from
the
passes
must
be
devoted
to
the
sole
purpose
of
keeping
the
corps
as
far
as
possible
from
the
alberche
even
knowing
that
venegas
was
hostile
to
cuesta
and
that
he
was
a
man
of
no
mark
or
capacity
wellesley
could
not
have
expected
that
he
would
disobey
orders
waste
time
and
fail
utterly
in
keeping
touch
with
sebastiani
or
threatening
madrid
the
one
irreparable
fault
in
the
drawing
up
of
the
whole
plan
of
campaign
was
the
fundamental
one
that
wellesley
had
undertaken
to
with
spanish
armies
before
he
had
gauged
the
weak
points
of
the
generals
and
their
men
if
he
had
held
the
post
of
of
the
allied
forces
and
could
have
issued
orders
that
were
obeyed
without
discussion
the
case
would
have
been
different
but
he
had
to
act
in
conjunction
with
two
colleagues
one
of
whom
was
suspicious
of
his
intentions
and
jealous
of
his
preponderant
capacity
while
the
other
deliberately
neglected
to
carry
out
clear
and
cogent
orders
from
his
superior
officer
cuesta
s
impracticability
and
venegas
s
disobedience
could
not
have
been
foreseen
by
one
who
had
no
previous
experience
of
spanish
armies
still
less
had
wellesley
realized
all
the
defects
of
the
spanish
rank
and
file
when
placed
in
line
of
battle
that
he
did
not
hold
an
exaggerated
opinion
of
their
merits
when
he
started
on
the
campaign
is
shown
by
letters
which
he
wrote
nine
months
before
but
he
was
still
under
the
impression
that
if
cautiously
handled
and
not
exposed
to
unnecessary
dangers
they
would
do
good
service
he
had
yet
to
witness
the
gratuitous
panic
of
portago
s
division
on
the
eve
of
talavera
and
the
helplessness
of
the
spanish
cavalry
at
the
combats
of
gamonal
and
arzobispo
after
a
month
s
experience
of
cuesta
and
his
men
wellesley
vowed
never
again
to
take
part
in
grand
operations
with
a
spanish
general
as
his
equal
and
colleague
this
was
the
teaching
of
experience
and
on
july
the
experience
was
yet
to
come
see
wellington
to
castlereagh
from
ramalhal
the
interview
at
the
bridge
of
almaraz
had
not
been
very
satisfactory
to
wellesley
but
it
was
far
from
having
undeceived
him
as
to
the
full
extent
of
the
difficulties
that
lay
before
him
he
wrote
to
frere
at
seville
that
he
had
been
on
the
whole
well
received
and
that
cuesta
had
not
displayed
any
jealousy
of
him
as
that
sentiment
was
at
this
moment
the
predominant
feeling
in
the
old
man
s
breast
it
is
clear
that
he
had
succeeded
in
hiding
it
but
the
obstinate
silence
of
wellesley
s
colleague
had
worried
him
o
donoju
had
done
all
the
talking
and
it
was
impossible
to
say
what
plans
the
general
he
was
moreover
somewhat
perturbed
by
the
rumours
which
his
staff
had
picked
up
from
the
estremaduran
officers
to
the
effect
that
cuesta
was
so
much
the
enemy
of
the
central
junta
that
he
was
plotting
a
for
its
deposition
as
to
the
fighting
powers
of
the
spanish
army
wellesley
wrote
to
castlereagh
that
the
troops
were
ill
clothed
but
well
armed
and
the
officers
appeared
to
take
pains
with
their
discipline
some
of
the
corps
of
infantry
were
certainly
good
and
the
horses
of
the
cavalry
were
in
good
only
ten
days
later
he
was
to
utter
the
very
different
opinion
that
owing
to
their
miserable
state
of
discipline
and
their
want
of
officers
properly
qualified
these
troops
are
entirely
incapable
of
performing
any
manœuvre
however
simple
and
that
whole
corps
officers
and
men
run
off
on
the
first
appearance
of
danger
the
general
sentiment
of
the
army
appears
to
be
contempt
for
the
junta
and
the
present
form
of
government
great
confidence
in
cuesta
and
a
belief
that
he
is
too
powerful
for
the
junta
and
will
overturn
that
government
this
sentiment
appears
to
be
so
general
that
i
conceive
that
the
duke
of
albuquerque
must
entertain
it
equally
with
others
but
i
have
not
seen
wellesley
to
frere
from
plasencia
july
wellesley
to
castlereagh
talavera
wellesley
to
his
brother
the
marquis
wellesley
deleytosa
the
british
had
indeed
many
moral
and
mental
experiences
to
go
through
between
the
interview
at
mirabete
on
july
and
the
retreat
from
talavera
on
august
section
xvi
chapter
iv
the
march
to
talavera
quarrel
of
wellesley
and
cuesta
having
returned
to
his
army
on
july
wellesley
gave
orders
for
the
whole
force
to
get
ready
for
a
general
advance
on
the
morning
of
the
eighteenth
the
day
which
had
been
chosen
for
the
commencement
of
operations
at
the
conference
of
almaraz
it
would
have
been
in
every
way
desirable
to
have
moved
out
at
once
and
not
to
have
waited
for
these
six
days
if
the
march
against
victor
had
been
fixed
for
the
thirteenth
or
fourteenth
the
french
would
have
been
caught
unprepared
for
as
late
as
the
seventeenth
king
joseph
and
his
adviser
jourdan
were
under
the
impression
that
the
force
at
plasencia
consisted
of
nothing
more
than
a
portuguese
division
of
men
and
it
was
only
on
the
that
they
received
the
definite
information
that
the
whole
british
army
was
upon
the
tietar
it
is
clear
that
by
advancing
five
days
earlier
than
he
actually
did
wellesley
might
have
caught
the
enemy
in
a
state
of
complete
dispersion
the
corps
being
on
july
still
at
madridejos
in
la
mancha
and
the
king
with
his
reserves
at
madrid
if
attacked
on
the
seventeenth
or
the
eighteenth
as
he
might
well
have
been
victor
would
have
found
it
impossible
to
call
up
sebastiani
in
time
and
must
have
fallen
back
in
haste
to
the
capital
the
allies
could
then
have
cut
him
off
from
the
corps
which
must
have
retreated
by
a
circuitous
route
and
could
not
have
rejoined
the
main
body
of
the
french
army
in
time
for
a
battle
in
front
of
madrid
see
jourdan
s
and
his
letter
to
soult
of
july
in
which
no
sign
whatever
appears
of
the
knowledge
of
the
advance
of
the
british
from
portugal
it
would
appear
that
wellesley
had
fixed
the
date
of
his
advance
so
late
as
the
eighteenth
mainly
because
of
the
difficulty
as
to
the
collection
of
provisions
which
was
now
looming
before
him
in
larger
proportions
than
ever
but
it
is
possible
that
the
necessity
for
allowing
some
days
for
the
transmission
of
the
plan
of
campaign
to
venegas
also
counted
for
something
in
the
drawing
up
of
the
it
would
have
been
rash
to
start
before
the
army
of
la
mancha
was
prepared
to
take
its
part
in
the
joint
plan
of
operations
so
much
depended
upon
the
diversion
which
venegas
was
to
execute
that
it
would
have
been
a
mistake
to
move
before
he
could
break
up
from
his
distant
cantonments
at
santa
cruz
de
mudela
no
word
however
concerning
this
appears
in
wellesley
s
correspondence
from
july
to
july
his
dispatches
show
anxiety
about
nothing
save
his
food
and
his
transport
every
day
that
he
stayed
at
plasencia
made
him
feel
more
uncomfortable
concerning
the
question
of
supplies
the
corn
which
the
alcaldes
of
the
vera
had
promised
to
secure
for
him
had
begun
to
come
in
though
in
driblets
and
small
consignments
but
there
was
no
means
of
getting
it
forward
transport
was
absolutely
unprocurable
wellesley
sent
officers
to
scour
the
as
far
as
bejar
and
ciudad
rodrigo
but
they
could
procure
him
neither
mules
nor
carts
he
also
pressed
the
spanish
lozano
de
torres
to
hunt
up
every
animal
that
could
be
procured
but
to
small
effect
the
fact
was
that
estremadura
was
not
at
any
time
rich
in
beasts
or
vehicles
and
that
the
peasantry
had
sent
away
most
of
those
they
owned
while
the
french
lay
at
almaraz
lest
they
should
be
carried
off
by
the
enemy
wellesley
who
did
not
understand
the
limited
resources
of
this
part
of
spain
was
inclined
to
believe
that
the
authorities
were
hostile
or
even
treacherous
the
central
junta
had
promised
him
transport
in
order
to
make
sure
of
his
starting
on
the
campaign
along
the
tagus
and
when
transport
failed
to
appear
he
attributed
it
to
rather
than
to
poverty
no
doubt
he
was
fully
justified
in
his
view
that
an
army
operating
in
a
friendly
country
may
rationally
expect
to
draw
both
food
and
the
means
to
carry
it
from
the
regions
through
which
it
is
passing
but
sometimes
the
provisions
or
the
transport
are
not
forthcoming
merely
because
the
one
or
the
other
is
not
to
be
found
it
is
certain
that
both
estremadura
and
the
valley
of
the
central
tagus
were
at
this
moment
harried
absolutely
bare
victor
s
despairing
letters
from
caceres
in
may
and
from
la
calzada
in
june
are
sufficient
proof
of
the
fact
in
a
district
where
the
marshal
said
that
he
could
not
collect
five
days
provisions
by
any
manner
of
exertion
and
that
his
men
were
dropping
down
dead
from
actual
starvation
so
that
he
must
retire
or
see
his
whole
corps
crumble
away
it
is
clear
that
the
central
junta
could
not
have
created
food
for
the
british
army
cuesta
s
troops
were
living
from
hand
to
mouth
on
supplies
sent
forward
from
andalusia
or
they
could
not
have
continued
to
exist
in
the
land
the
only
district
which
was
intact
was
that
between
coria
and
plasencia
and
this
was
actually
at
the
moment
feeding
the
british
army
and
had
done
so
now
for
ten
days
or
more
but
unfortunately
the
vera
could
give
corn
but
no
draught
animals
if
wellesley
had
known
this
he
must
either
have
exerted
himself
to
procure
more
transport
before
leaving
abrantes
a
difficult
task
for
he
had
already
drained
portugal
of
carts
and
mules
or
have
refused
to
march
till
the
spaniards
sent
him
wagon
trains
from
andalusia
it
would
have
taken
months
for
the
junta
to
collect
and
send
forward
such
trains
they
had
dispatched
all
that
they
could
procure
to
cuesta
the
campaign
on
the
tagus
in
short
would
never
have
been
fought
if
wellesley
had
understood
the
state
of
affairs
that
he
was
to
encounter
that
food
was
coming
in
but
no
transport
is
clearly
proved
by
wellesley
s
letter
to
the
junta
of
plasencia
on
july
upon
entering
spain
i
expected
to
derive
that
assistance
in
provisions
and
other
means
transport
which
an
army
invariably
receives
from
the
country
in
which
it
is
stationed
more
particularly
when
it
has
been
sent
to
aid
the
people
of
that
country
have
not
been
disappointed
in
the
expectation
that
i
had
formed
of
receiving
supplies
of
provisions
and
i
am
much
obliged
to
the
junta
for
the
pains
they
have
i
am
convinced
that
they
did
everything
in
their
power
to
procure
us
the
other
means
we
required
transport
although
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
we
have
not
received
see
pp
and
the
causes
therefore
of
the
deadlock
that
was
about
to
occur
were
partly
the
incompetence
of
the
central
junta
in
promising
the
british
army
the
use
of
resources
which
did
not
exist
partly
wellesley
s
natural
ignorance
of
the
miserable
state
of
central
spain
he
had
never
entered
the
country
before
and
could
not
know
of
its
poverty
he
had
trusted
to
the
usual
military
theory
that
the
ought
to
provide
for
a
friendly
army
on
the
march
but
in
spain
all
military
theories
failed
to
act
napoleon
committed
precisely
similar
errors
when
he
directed
his
army
corps
to
move
about
in
castile
as
if
they
were
in
germany
or
lombardy
and
found
exactly
the
same
hindrances
as
did
the
british
general
in
later
years
wellesley
never
moved
without
a
heavy
train
and
a
vast
provision
of
and
in
july
he
had
still
to
learn
the
art
of
conducting
a
spanish
campaign
meanwhile
he
was
beginning
to
feel
most
uncomfortable
about
the
question
of
provisions
his
anxiety
is
shown
by
his
letters
to
frere
and
beresford
it
is
impossible
he
wrote
to
express
the
inconvenience
and
risk
that
we
incur
from
the
want
of
means
of
conveyance
which
i
can
not
believe
the
country
could
not
furnish
there
existed
any
inclination
to
furnish
the
officers
complain
and
i
believe
not
without
reason
that
the
country
gives
unwillingly
the
supplies
of
provisions
that
we
have
required
and
we
have
not
procured
a
cart
or
a
mule
for
the
service
of
the
army
but
to
o
donoju
the
chief
of
the
staff
of
the
estremaduran
army
he
wrote
in
even
more
drastic
terms
employing
phrases
that
were
certain
to
provoke
resentment
he
had
he
said
scoured
the
whole
region
as
far
as
ciudad
rodrigo
for
transport
and
to
no
effect
if
the
people
of
spain
are
unable
or
unwilling
to
supply
what
the
army
requires
i
am
afraid
that
they
must
do
without
its
he
had
been
forced
to
come
to
a
painful
decision
and
in
order
to
be
fair
and
candid
to
general
cuesta
he
must
proceed
to
inform
him
that
he
would
execute
the
plan
for
falling
upon
victor
behind
the
alberche
but
that
when
this
had
been
done
he
would
stir
no
step
further
and
begin
no
new
operation
till
he
had
been
supplied
with
the
means
of
transport
which
the
army
requires
wellesley
to
frere
plasencia
july
wellesley
to
o
donoju
plasencia
july
after
dispatching
this
ultimatum
whose
terms
and
tone
leave
something
to
be
desired
for
surely
cuesta
was
the
last
person
to
be
saddled
with
the
responsibility
for
the
pledges
made
by
his
enemies
of
the
central
junta
wellesley
issued
orders
for
the
army
to
march
he
had
been
joined
at
plasencia
by
the
last
of
the
regiments
from
lisbon
which
reached
him
in
time
for
talavera
but
had
been
forced
to
leave
sick
behind
him
for
the
army
was
still
in
a
bad
condition
as
regards
health
it
was
therefore
with
little
over
men
that
he
began
his
advance
to
the
alberche
it
was
executed
with
punctual
observance
of
the
dates
that
had
been
settled
at
the
interview
at
almaraz
on
july
the
army
crossed
the
tietar
on
a
flying
bridge
built
at
bazagona
and
lay
at
miajadas
on
the
next
night
the
head
quarters
were
at
centinello
on
the
twentieth
the
british
entered
oropesa
here
cuesta
joined
them
with
his
whole
army
save
the
two
battalions
lent
to
wilson
and
the
two
others
under
the
marquis
del
reino
which
had
been
sent
to
the
puerto
de
baños
deducting
these
bayonets
and
his
sick
he
brought
over
horse
and
foot
to
the
rendezvous
the
junction
having
taken
place
on
the
the
advance
to
talavera
was
to
begin
next
morning
oropesa
lies
only
nineteen
miles
from
that
town
and
as
victor
s
cavalry
vedettes
were
in
sight
it
was
clear
that
contact
with
the
enemy
would
be
established
during
the
course
of
the
day
accordingly
the
allied
armies
marched
with
caution
the
spaniards
along
the
the
british
following
a
parallel
path
on
the
left
across
the
slopes
of
the
hills
which
divide
the
valley
of
the
tietar
from
that
of
the
tagus
the
foot
and
light
dragoons
about
midday
the
spaniards
fell
in
with
the
whole
of
the
cavalry
division
of
which
victor
had
thrown
out
as
a
screen
in
front
of
talavera
he
had
ascertained
on
the
evening
of
the
preceding
day
that
cuesta
was
about
to
move
forward
and
was
anxious
to
compel
him
to
display
his
entire
force
above
all
he
desired
to
ascertain
whether
the
rumours
concerning
the
presence
of
british
troops
in
his
front
were
correct
accordingly
he
had
left
two
battalions
of
infantry
in
the
town
of
talavera
and
thrown
out
the
six
regiments
of
dragoons
in
front
of
it
near
the
village
of
gamonal
the
spaniards
were
advancing
with
albuquerque
s
cavalry
division
as
an
advanced
guard
but
seeing
in
his
front
the
duke
refused
to
attack
and
sent
back
for
infantry
and
guns
cuesta
pushed
forward
the
division
of
zayas
to
support
him
but
even
when
it
arrived
the
spaniards
made
no
headway
they
continued
skirmishing
for
four
hours
till
the
british
light
cavalry
began
to
appear
on
their
left
though
much
more
numerous
than
the
enemy
wrote
an
they
made
no
attempt
to
drive
him
in
but
contented
themselves
with
deploying
into
several
long
lines
making
a
very
formidable
appearance
we
had
expected
to
see
them
closely

heard
that
they
were
peculiarly

warfare

we
found
them

incapable

rode
off

to
the

by

they
passed

two
small

of

came
out
of

one
of

against

separate
occasions

came
on

after
receiving
the

of

fell
into

the
impression
made
by
the
spanish

on
the
numerous
british
observers
was
very
bad
no
men
could
have
more
carefully
avoided
coming
to
close
quarters
than
did

but
of

after
crossing
the
plain
to
the
north
of
talavera
the
french
both
cavalry
and
infantry
forded
the
alberche
and
halted
on
the
further
bank
on
arriving
at
the
line
of
underwood
which
masks
the
river
the
pursuers
found
the
whole
of
victor
s
corps
in
position
the
thickets
on
the
further
side
were
swarming
with
and
two
batteries
opened
on
anson
s
brigade
as
it
drew
near
to
the
water
and
sent
balls
whizzing
among
wellesley
s
staff
when
he
pushed
forward
to
reconnoitre
the
position
it
was
soon
seen
that
victor
had
selected
very
favourable
indeed
he
had
been
staying
at
talavera
long
enough
to
enable
him
to
get
a
perfect
knowledge
of
the
military
features
of
the
neighbourhood
the
corps
was
drawn
up
on
a
range
of
heights
about
yards
behind
the
alberche
with
its
left
resting
on
the
impassable
tagus
and
its
right
on
a
wooded
hill
behind
which
the
smaller
river
makes
a
sharp
turn
to
the
east
so
as
to
cover
that
flank
the
position
was
formidable
but
rather
too
long
for
the
men
who
formed
the
french
army
having
learnt
from
the
people
of
talavera
that
the
enemy
had
received
no
reinforcements
up
to
that
morning
from
madrid
or
any
other
quarter
wellesley
was
anxious
to
close
with
them
at
once
the
afternoon
was
too
far
spent
for
any
attempt
to
force
the
passage
on
the
but
on
the
next
day
july
the
british
general
hoped
to
fight
the
alberche
was
crossed
by
a
wooden
bridge
which
the
enemy
had
not
destroyed
and
was
fordable
in
many
places
there
seemed
to
be
no
reason
why
the
lines
behind
it
might
not
be
forced
by
a
resolute
attack
delivered
with
numbers
which
were
as
two
to
one
to
those
of
the
french
accordingly
wellesley
left
the
division
and
anson
s
light
horse
in
front
of
the
right
wing
of
victor
s
position
and
encamped
the
rest
of
his
army
some
miles
to
the
rear
in
the
plain
between
talavera
and
the
alberche
in
the
same
way
albuquerque
and
zayas
halted
for
the
night
opposite
the
bridge
on
the
french
left
while
the
main
body
of
the
spaniards
occupied
the
town
in
their
rear
in
the
evening
hours
wellesley
endeavoured
to
urge
upon
cuesta
the
necessity
for
delivering
an
attack
at
dawn
he
undertook
to
force
the
northern
fords
and
to
turn
the
enemy
s
right
if
his
colleague
would
attack
the
southern
fords
and
the
bridge
the
received
the
suggestion
with
dry
civility
and
asked
for
time
to
think
it
over
after
a
conference
with
his
subordinates
he
at
last
sent
word
at
midnight
that
he
would
accept
the
proposed
plan
of
operations
at
o
clock
therefore
on
the
morning
of
the
wellesley
brought
down
sherbrooke
s
and
mackenzie
s
divisions
to
the
ground
opposite
the
fords
and
waited
for
the
arrival
of
the
spanish
columns
on
his
right
they
did
not
appear
and
after
long
waiting
the
british
general
rode
to
seek
his
colleague
he
found
him
opposite
the
bridge
of
the
alberche
seated
on
the
cushions
taken
out
of
his
carriage
for
he
had
driven
to
the
outposts
in
a
coach
drawn
by
nine
mules
the
picture
of
mental
and
physical
the
old
man
murmured
that
the
enemy
s
position
had
not
been
sufficiently
reconnoitred
that
it
would
take
time
to
get
his
army
drawn
out
opposite
the
points
which
it
was
to
attack
that
he
was
not
sure
of
the
fords
that
the
bridge
over
which
his
column
would
have
to
advance
looked
too
weak
to
bear
artillery
and
many
other
things
to
the
same
effect
finally
urging
that
the
forcing
of
the
alberche
must
be
put
off
to
the
next
day
as
he
had
not
got
his
troops
into
battle
order
it
was
clear
that
the
morning
would
be
wasted
but
wellesley
tried
to
bargain
for
an
attack
in
the
afternoon
the
asked
for
more
time
and
would
listen
to
no
arguments
in
favour
of
fighting
on
that
day
after
a
heated
discussion
wellesley
had
to
yield
he
could
not
venture
to
assail
the
french
with
his
own
army
alone
and
without
any
assistance
from
the
spaniards
accordingly
it
was
agreed
that
the
advance
should
not
be
made
till
the
dawn
of
the
in
the
afternoon
the
pickets
sent
back
information
that
victor
seemed
to
be
on
the
move
and
that
his
line
was
growing
thin
cuesta
was
then
persuaded
to
go
forward
to
the
outposts
he
was
hoisted
on
to
his
horse
by
two
grenadiers
while
an
stood
on
the
other
side
to
conduct
his
right
leg
over
the
croup
and
place
it
in
the
stirrup
then
hunched
up
on
his
saddle
he
rode
down
to
the
river
observed
that
the
greater
part
of
the
enemy
were
still
in
position
and
refused
to
attack
till
next
morning
at
dawn
therefore
on
the
the
allied
army
moved
forward
to
the
alberche
in
three
columns
and
found
as
might
have
been
expected
that
the
french
had
disappeared
on
seeing
the
masses
of
redcoats
opposite
his
right
upon
the
previous
day
victor
had
realized
at
last
that
he
had
before
him
the
whole
british
army
he
had
sent
his
train
to
the
rear
in
the
afternoon
and
drawn
off
his
entire
force
after
dusk
by
dawn
he
was
more
than
ten
miles
away
on
the
road
to
santa
ollala
and
madrid
it
was
useless
to
pursue
him
with
any
hope
of
forcing
him
to
a
battle
the
chance
of
crushing
him
before
he
should
receive
any
further
reinforcements
had
disappeared
it
is
not
at
all
to
his
credit
as
a
general
that
he
had
held
his
ground
so
long
if
he
had
been
attacked
on
the
as
wellesley
had
desired
he
must
certainly
have
suffered
a
disaster
he
had
but
men
and
it
is
clear
that
while
the
spaniards
were
attacking
his
left
and
centre
he
could
not
have
set
aside
men
enough
to
hold
back
the
assault
of
the
solid
mass
of
british
troops
upon
his
right
he
should
have
vanished
on
the
the
moment
that
reported
that
wellesley
s
army
was
in
the
field
by
staying
for
another
day
on
the
alberche
he
risked
the
direst
disaster
the
british
general
would
have
been
more
than
human
if
he
had
not
manifested
his
anger
and
disgust
at
the
way
in
which
his
colleague
had
flinched
from
the
agreement
to
attack
and
sacrificed
the
certainty
of
victory
he
showed
his
resentment
by
acting
up
to
the
terms
of
his
letter
written
from
plasencia
five
days
before
by
announcing
to
cuesta
that
having
carried
out
his
pledge
to
drive
the
french
from
behind
the
alberche
he
should
now
refuse
to
move
forward
unless
he
were
furnished
with
transport
sufficient
to
make
it
certain
that
the
army
could
reach
madrid
without
any
privations
he
was
able
to
state
with
perfect
truth
that
he
had
already
been
forced
to
place
his
troops
on
that
very
morning
to
the
men
of
sherbrooke
s
and
mackenzie
s
divisions
and
of
anson
s
light
cavalry
he
had
only
been
able
to
issue
rations
of
bread
nothing
of
course
could
be
found
at
talavera
where
the
french
had
been
quartered
for
many
days
victor
had
only
been
maintaining
his
troops
by
the
aid
of
biscuit
sent
down
from
madrid
and
by
seizing
and
threshing
for
himself
the
small
amount
of
corn
which
had
been
sown
in
the
neighbourhood
that
spring
wellesley
was
wrong
in
supposing
that
the
corps
had
been
supporting
itself
with
ease
from
the
he
was
equally
at
fault
when
he
asserted
that
the
spanish
army
has
plenty
to
cuesta
was
at
this
moment
complaining
to
the
junta
that
he
was
short
of
provisions
and
that
the
food
which
he
had
brought
forward
from
the
guadiana
was
almost
exhausted
meanwhile
every
exertion
was
being
made
to
collect
flour
and
transport
from
the
rear
wellesley
wrote
to
o
donoju
that
he
had
at
last
hopes
of
securing
some
wagons
from
the
plasencia
district
within
three
days
and
that
in
the
meantime
he
might
get
something
to
he
had
some
days
before
sent
orders
back
even
so
far
as
abrantes
to
order
up
portuguese
carts
which
had
been
collected
there
and
the
central
junta
had
informed
him
that
a
train
for
his
use
had
already
started
from
andalusia
but
there
was
no
very
early
prospect
of
relieving
the
present
distress

cuesta
was
as
might
have
been
expected
as
angry
with
wellesley
for
refusing
to
move
forward
from
talavera
as
wellesley
was
with
cuesta
for
missing
the
great
opportunity
of
july
when
informed
that
the
british
army
was
not
about
to
advance
any
further
he
announced
that
he
for
his
part
should
go
on
that
victor
was
in
full
flight
and
that
he
would
pursue
him
to
madrid
in
that
case
dryly
observed
wellesley
cuesta
will
get
himself
into
a
scrape
but
any
movement
by
me
to
his
assistance
is
quite
out
of
the
question
if
the
enemy
discover
that
we
are
not
with
him
he
will
be
beaten
or
must
return
the
enemy
will
make
this
discovery
if
he
should
risk
any
attempt
upon
their
rearguard
at
santa
ollala
in
reply
to
the
s
declaration
that
he
should
press
victor
hard
his
colleague
only
warned
him
that
he
would
be
wiser
to
secure
the
course
of
the
tagus
and
open
communication
with
venegas
while
the
measures
should
be
taken
to
supply
the
british
army
with
means
of
transport
the
spaniard
would
not
listen
to
any
such
advice
and
hurried
forward
though
he
had
been
for
many
weeks
refusing
to
fight
the
corps
when
it
lay
in
estremadura
he
was
now
determined
to
risk
a
second
medellin
apparently
he
was
obsessed
by
the
idea
that
victor
was
in
full
retreat
for
madrid
and
would
not
make
a
serious
stand
underlying
his
sudden
energy
there
was
also
some
idea
that
he
would
disconcert
his
masters
of
the
central
junta
by
recovering
the
capital
he
had
discovered
it
would
seem
that
the
junta
had
sent
secret
orders
to
venegas
directing
him
to
take
charge
of
the
city
on
its
reconquest
and
giving
him
authority
to
nominate
the
civil
and
military
officers
for
its
administration
if
the
army
of
estremadura
seized
madrid
while
the
army
of
la

was
still
lingering
on
the
way
thither
all
these
plans

s
remarks
on
the
inexplicable

of

to
be
in

on
an
early
day

cuesta
pushed
on
very
boldly
on
the
afternoon
of
the
dividing
his
army
into
two
columns
of
which
one
marched
on
santa
ollala
by
the
to
the
capital
while
the
other
moved
by
cevolla
and
torrijos
on
the
to
toledo
he
was
uncertain
whether
victor
had
retired
by
one
or
by
both
of
these
routes
if
all
his
corps
had
taken
the
former
path
the
natural
deduction
was
that
he
was
thinking
only
of
madrid
if
the
toledo
road
had
also
been
used
there
was
reason
for
concluding
that
the
marshal
must
be
intending
to
join
sebastiani
and
the
corps
who
might
be
looked
for
in
that
direction
late
in
the
day
the
spanish
general
ascertained
that
the
main
body
of
victor
s
army
had
taken
the
latter
route
he
proceeded
to
follow
it
placing
his
head
quarters
that
night
at
torrijos
only
fifteen
miles
from
toledo
next
morning
he
learnt
to
his
surprise
and
dismay
that
he
had
in
front
of
him
not
only
the
corps
but
also
sebastiani
and
the
king
s
reserves
from
madrid
for
just
at
this
moment
the
whole
french
force

been
successfully
concentrated

were
gathered
in

venegas

diversion
had
utterly
failed
to
draw
off
the

the

come
down
in
haste
from
madrid
and
thus
the
whole
plan
of
campaign
which
the
allied
generals
had
drawn
up
had
been
foiled
partly
by
the
sloth
of

from

he
might
call

already

also
demanded

on
madrid
it
was
therefore
an
exquisitely
inappropriate
moment
at
which
to
demand
that
the
greater
part
of
the
king
s
central
reserve
should
be
sent
off
from
the
capital
to
the
neighbourhood
of
salamanca
there
were
other
parts
of
soult
s
lists
of
requisitions
which
were
equally
impracticable
it
is
clear
that
suchet
could
not
have
spared
a
man
from
aragon
and
that
cyr
with
the
siege
of
gerona
on
his
hands
would
have
found
it
absolutely
impossible
to
make
large
detachments
from
catalonia
even
if
he
and
suchet
had
been
able
to
send
off
troops
to
leon
they
would
have
taken
months
to
reach
the
galician
frontier
the
demand
for
francs
in
hard
cash
was
also
most
unpalatable
king
joseph
was
at
this
moment
in
the
direst
straits
for
money
his
brother
could
send
him
nothing
while
the
austrian
war
was
in
progress
and
as
he
was
not
in
proper
military
possession
of
any
large
district
of
spain
he
was
at
this
moment
in
a
condition
of
hopeless
bankruptcy
he
confessed
to
soult
that
he
was
living
from
hand
to
mouth
by
the
pitiful
expedient
of
melting
down
and
coining
the
silver
plate
in
the
royal
palace
at
madrid
jourdan
therefore
replied
in
the
king
s
behalf
to
soult
that
he
must
do
his
best
with
the
men
already
at
his
disposition
that
no
troops
from
catalonia
aragon
or
madrid
could
be
spared
and
that
money
could
not
be
found
all
that
could
be
given
was
the
that
had
been
demanded
rations
of
biscuit
and
an
authorization
to
raise
forced
contributions
in
old
castile
for
the
protection
of
his
flanks
and
his
communications
the
marshal
must
utilize
kellermann
s
dragoons
and
the
other
unattached
troops
in
the
valley
of
the
douro
a
force
which
if
raised
to
men
by
detachments
from
the
or
corps
could
keep
la
romana
and
the
galicians
in
check
jourdan
to
soult
july
from
madrid
it
is
curious
to
note
how
entirely
ignorant
both
soult
and
the
king
were
as
to
the
real
dangers
of
the
moment
soult
had
drawn
up
and
joseph
acceded
to
a
plan
for
the
siege
of
ciudad
rodrigo
and
an
invasion
of
northern
portugal
operations
which
would
take
long
weeks
of
preparation
at
the
time
when
madrid
was
in
imminent
danger
from
the
combined
armies
of
wellesley
cuesta
and
venegas
the
marshal
s
plan
was
perfectly
correct
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
higher
strategy
the
main
objective
of
the
french
was
certainly
the
british
army
and
it
would
have
been
highly
advisable
to
invade
northern
portugal
with
men
in
the
front
line
and
in
support
if
the
circumstances
of
the
moment
had
permitted
it
but
these
circumstances
were
hidden
alike
from
soult
and
the
king
owing
to
the
impossibility
of
obtaining
accurate
information
of
the
movements
of
the
allies
the
fundamental
difficulty
of
all
french
operations
in
the
peninsula
was
that
the
commanders
could
never
discover
the
whereabouts
of
the
enemy
till
he
actually
came
in
contact
with
their
outposts
hence
it
chanced
that
soult
was
planning
and
joseph
approving
a
campaign
on
the
borders
of
northern
portugal
at
the
precise
moment
when
the
british
were
on
the
march
for
talavera
le

it
was
actually
not
until
july
that
the
king
s
eyes
were
at
last
unsealed
victor
having
come
into
collision
with
the
cavalry
of
wellesley
s
advanced
guard
sent
news
to
madrid
that
the
british
army
had
joined
cuesta
and
had
reached
the
alberche
on
the
same
day
by
a
fortunate
chance
there
also
arrived
in
the
capital
another
emissary
of
soult
with
a
message
much
less
impracticable
than
that
which
had
last
been
sent
this
was
general
foy
whom
the
duke
of
dalmatia
had
dispatched
on
july
after
receiving
very
definite
rumours
that
the
british
were
moving
in
the
valley
of
the
tagus
and
not
approaching
old
castile
the
marshal
sent
word
that
in
this
case
he
must
of
course
concert
a
common
plan
of
operations
with
the
king
and
abandon
any
immediate
action
against
portugal
he
suggested
that
his
best
plan
would
be
to
concentrate
his
three
corps
at
salamanca
and
to
march
against
the
flank
and
rear
of
the
english
by
way
of
bejar
and
the
puerto
de
baños
if
the
king
could
cover
madrid
for
a
time
with
the
and
corps
he
would
undertake
to
present
himself
in
force
upon
wellesley
s
line
of
communications
a
move
which
must
infallibly
stop
the
advance
of
the
allies
towards
the
capital
if
they
hesitated
a
moment
after
his
arrival
at
plasencia
they
would
be
caught
between
two
fires
and
might
be
not
merely
checked
but
surrounded
and
destroyed
soult
added
however
that
he
could
not
move
till
the
corps
had
received
the
provision
of
artillery
which
was
on
its
way
from
madrid
and
till
he
had
rallied
ney
s
troops
who
were
still
at
astorga
close
to
the
foot
of
the
galician
mountains
compare
le
noble
s
account
of
soult
s
proposals
pp
with
jourdan
s
and
with
the
militaire
du
général
napoleon
at
a
later
date
criticized
this
plan
severely
declaring
that
soult
ought
to
have
marched
on
madrid
to
join
the
king
and
not
on
plasencia
he
grounded
his
objections
to
the
scheme
on
the
strategical
principle
that
combined
operations
on
external
lines
should
be
avoided
the
march
of
marshal
soult
he
wrote
was
both
dangerous
and
useless
dangerous
because
the
other
army
might
be
beaten
as
happened
at
talavera
before
he
could
succour
it
so
that
the
safety
of
all
my
armies
in
spain
was
compromised
useless
because
the
english
had
nothing
to
fear
they
could
get
behind
the
tagus
in
three
hours
and
whether
they
crossed
at
talavera
or
at
almaraz
or
anywhere
else
they
could
secure
a
safe
line
of
retreat
on
against
this
criticism
the
defence
made
by
both
soult
and
king
joseph
was
that
it
would
have
required
a
much
longer
time
to
bring
the
three
corps
from
the
douro
to
madrid
than
to
plasencia
that
it
would
have
taken
them
at
least
ten
days
to
reach
madrid
and
that
during
those
days
the
king
and
his
army
might
have
been
beaten
and
driven
out
of
the
capital
by
the
united
forces
of
wellesley
cuesta
and
venegas
it
was
of
course
impossible
to
foresee
on
july
that
wellesley
would
refuse
to
pursue
victor
beyond
talavera
or
that
venegas
would
let
sebastiani
slip
away
from
him
accordingly
king
joseph
and
jourdan
fell
in
with
soult
s
suggestion
because
they
thought
that
he
would
come
sooner
into
the
field
if
he
marched
on
plasencia
and
would
remove
the
pressure
of
the
british
army
from
them
at
a
comparatively
early
date
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
took
a
much
longer
time
to
reach
plasencia
than
they
had
expected
they
had
hoped
that
he
might
be
there
on
july
while
his
vanguard
only
reached
the
place
on
august
and
his
main
body
on
the
second
and
third
but
it
seems
clear
that
the
expectation
that
he
would
intervene
on
the
earlier
date
was
far
too
sanguine
soult
dared
not
move
till
his
three
corps
were
well
closed
up
and
since
ney
had
to
come
all
the
way
from
astorga
it
would
have
been
impossible
in
any
case
to
mass
the
army
at
plasencia
much
earlier
than
was
actually
done
napoleon
s
remark
that
soult
could
not
hope
to
catch
or
surround
the
british
army
seems
more
convincing
than
his
criticism
of
the
march
on
plasencia
if
the
passes
of
the
sierra
de
gata
had
been
properly
held
and
prompt
news
had
been
transmitted
to
talavera
that
the
french
were
on
the
move
from
the
valley
of
the
douro
wellesley
would
have
had
ample
time
to
cover
himself
by
crossing
the
tagus
and
transferring
his
army
to
the
line
of
operations
the
british
general
always
defended
himself
by
this
plea
and
complained
that
those
who
spoke
of
him
as
being
cut
off
from
portugal
by
the
arrival
of
soult
at
plasencia
forgot
that
he
had
as
good
a
base
at
elvas
and
badajoz
as
at
abrantes
for
the
controversy
about
the
expected
date
of
soult
s
arrival
at
plasencia
see
joseph
s
and
jourdan
s
letter
to
napoleon
in
ducasse
s
du
roi
and
on
the
other
side
le
noble
s
de
but
we
must
not
look
too
far
forward
into
the
later
stages
of
the
campaign
it
is
enough
to
say
that
jourdan
and
joseph
sent
back
foy
to
rejoin
soult
on
the
same
day
that
he
had
reached
madrid
bearing
the
orders
that
the
marshal
was
to
collect
his
three
corps
with
the
greatest
possible
haste
and
to
march
by
salamanca
on
plasencia
where
they
trusted
that
he
might
present
himself
on
the
or
of
the
current
month
meanwhile
it
was
necessary
to
hold
back
cuesta
and
wellesley
till
the
duke
of
dalmatia
s
operations
in
their
rear
began
to
produce
their
effect
the
only
possible
way
of
doing
this
was
to
concentrate
in
all
haste
every
available
man
in
new
castile
and
to
cover
madrid
as
long
as
possible
this
massing
of
the
french
forces
turned
out
to
be
perfectly
feasible
since
venegas
had
neglected
to
press
in
upon
sebastiani
so
that
it
was
possible
to
withdraw
the
whole
corps
from
in
front
of
him
and
to
send
it
to
reinforce
victor
without
any
immediate
danger
accordingly
the
corps
was
directed
to
fall
back
from
its
perilous
advanced
position
on
the
alberche
and
to
draw
near
to
toledo
sebastiani
was
told
to
abandon
madridejos
and
la
mancha
and
to
hasten
by
forced
marches
toward
the
same
point
while
the
king
himself
resolved
to
leave
madrid
with
the
slenderest
of
garrisons
and
to
carry
the
rest
of
the
central
reserve
to
the
general
rendezvous
accordingly
he
left
only
one
brigade
of
dessolles
division
with
a
few
of
his
untrustworthy
spanish
levies
to
hold
the
capital
the
total
did
not
amount
to
much
over
men
and
general
belliard
the
governor
of
the
city
was
warned
that
he
must
be
prepared
to
retreat
into
the
retiro
forts
with
his
troops
and
the
whole
body
of
the
and
their
families
if
anything
untoward
should
occur
for
it
was
possible
that
an
insurrection
might
break
out
or
that
venegas
might
succeed
in
slipping
into
madrid
by
the
roads
from
the
east
or
again
that
wilson
whose
column
had
been
heard
of
at
escalona
and
was
believed
to
be
much
larger
than
was
actually
the
case
might
attempt
a
de
from
the
west
leaving
belliard
in
this
dangerous
and
responsible
position
the
king
marched
out
upon
the
with
the
remaining
brigade
of
dessolles
s
division
the
infantry
and
cavalry
of
his
french
guard
two
squadrons
of
chasseurs
and
fourteen
guns
a
force
of
some
men
he
had
reached
navalcarnero
with
the
intention
of
joining
victor
on
the
alberche
when
he
received
the
news
that
the
marshal
had
retired
towards
toledo
and
was
lying
at
bargas
behind
the
guadarrama
river
here
joseph
joined
him
on
the
morning
of
july
the
whole
consisted
of
infantry
of
the
guard
of
the
guard
godinot
s
brigade
of
dessolles
s
division
chasseurs
two
squadrons
artillery
two
batteries
total
on
their
concentration
a
force
of
men
was
collected
victor
having
brought
up
the
king
and
sebastiani
the
latter
had
placed
four
of
the
six
polish
battalions
of
valence
s
division
in
toledo
and
was
therefore
short
by
bayonets
of
the
total
force
of
his
corps
with
such
a
mass
of
good
troops
at
their
disposition
joseph
jourdan
and
victor
were
all
agreed
that
it
was
right
to
fall
upon
the
spaniards
without
delay
they
were
astonished
to
find
that
the
british
army
was
not
in
their
front
but
only
cuesta
s
troops
they
had
expected
to
see
the
whole
allied
host
before
them
and
were
overjoyed
to
discover
that
the
estremadurans
alone
had
pushed
forward
to
torrijos
and
santa
ollala
instead
therefore
of
being
obliged
to
fight
a
defensive
battle
behind
the
river
guadarrama
it
was
in
their
power
to
take
the
offensive
this
was
done
without
delay
on
the
morning
of
july
the
french
army
advanced
on
torrijos
with
the
corps
at
the
head
of
the
column
but
cuesta
when
once
he
had
discovered
the
strength
of
the
force
in
his
front
had
resolved
to
retreat
victor
found
opposed
to
him
only
the
division
of
zayas
and
two
cavalry
regiments
which
had
been
told
off
to
cover
the
withdrawal
of
the
estremaduran
army
the
marshal
sent
out
against
this
rearguard
the
chasseurs
of
merlin
and
the
dragoons
of
who
drove
in
the
spanish
horse
almost
exterminating
the
unfortunate
regiment
of
villaviciosa
which
in
retiring
chanced
to
blunder
against
the
high
stone
walls
of
some
enclosures
from
which
exit
was
difficult
zayas
then
went
to
the
rear
and
retired
towards
the
cavalry
division
of
albuquerque
which
cuesta
hastily
sent
to
his
assistance
the
french
cavalry
took
some
time
to
for
a
second
attack
and
their
infantry
was
still
far
off
the
spanish
rearguard
therefore
covered
by
albuquerque
s
horse
had
time
enough
to
fall
back
on
the
main
body
which
was
already
in
full
retreat
their
cavalry
then
followed
and
being
not
very
strenuously
pursued
by
merlin
and
got
off
in
safety
the
whole
army
marching
at
the
best
of
its
speed
and
in
considerable
disorder
finally
reached
the
alberche
without
being
caught
up
by
the
enemy
cuesta
found
the
british
divisions
of
sherbrooke
and
mackenzie
guarding
the
river
wellesley
had
sent
them
forward
when
he
heard
of
the
approach
of
the
french
and
had
placed
the
former
on
the
hills
above
the
further
side
of
the
bridge
to
cover
the
passage
and
the
latter
in
reserve
he
rode
out
himself
to
meet
the
spanish
general
and
begged
him
to
carry
his
army
beyond
the
alberche
as
it
would
be
extremely
dangerous
to
be
caught
with
such
an
obstacle
behind
him
and
no
means
of
retreat
save
a
long
bridge
and
three
fords
but
cuesta
tempted
providence
by
declaring
that
he
should
encamp
on
the
further
bank
as
his
troops
were
too
exhausted
to
risk
the
long
defile
across
the
bridge
after
dark
his
sullen
anger
against
wellesley
for
refusing
to
follow
him
on
the
was
still
smouldering
in
his
breast
and
the
english
were
convinced
that
he
remained
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
river
out
of
pure
perversity
merely
because
his
colleague
pressed
him
to
put
himself
in
safety
he
consented
however
to
retreat
next
morning
to
the
position
which
wellesley
had
selected
in
front
of
talavera
the
cavalry
regiment
of
villaviciosa
drawn
up
in
an
enclosure
with
but
one
exit
was
penned
in
by
the
enemy
and
cut
to
pieces
without
a
possibility
of
escape
a
british
officer
of
engineers
present
with
them
saved
himself
by
his
english
horse
taking
at
a
leap
the
barrier
which
the
spanish
horses
were
incapable
of
lord
munster
the
french
made
no
appearance
that
night
though
they
might
well
have
done
so
and
the
spanish
army
bivouacing
confusedly
in
the
narrow
slip
of
flat
ground
between
the
heights
and
the
alberche
enjoyed
undisturbed
rest
during
the
hours
of
darkness
it
is
impossible
not
to
marvel
at
the
slackness
with
which
victor
conducted
the
pursuit
he
had
twelve
regiments
of
splendid
cavalry
to
the
front
and
could
undoubtedly
have
pressed
the
estremadurans
hard
if
he
had
chosen
to
do
so
cuesta
s
retreating
columns
were
in
such
a
state
of
confusion
and
disorder
that
a
vigorous
assault
on
their
rear
might
have
caused
a
general
but
after
driving
in
zayas
in
the
early
morning
victor
moved
very
slowly
and
did
not
even
attempt
to
roll
up
albuquerque
s
cavalry
rearguard
though
he
could
have
assailed
it
with
very
superior
numbers
when
taxed
with
sloth
by
marshal
jourdan
he
merely
defended
himself
by
saying
that
the
horses
were
tired
and
that
the
infantry
was
still
too
far
to
the
rear
to
make
it
right
for
him
to
begin
a
combat
which
might
develop
into
a
general
engagement
but
it
is
hard
to
see
that
he
would
have
risked
anything
by
pressing
in
upon
albuquerque
for
if
cuesta
had
halted
his
whole
army
in
order
to
support
his
rearguard
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
the
french
cavalry
from
drawing
off
and
refusing
to
close
till
the
main
body
of
the
corps
should
come
up
he
had
six
regiments
of
s
dragoons
sabres
four
regiments
of
merlin
s
division
sabres
two
regiments
of
beaumont
s
of
corps
a
total
of
over
men
thanks
to
victor
s
slackness
the
spaniards
secured
an
unmolested
retreat
across
the
alberche
on
the
following
morning
it
is
said
that
cuesta
in
sheer
perversity
and
reluctance
to
listen
to
any
advice
proffered
him
by
wellesley
delayed
for
some
hours
before
he
would
retreat
and
that
when
at
last
he
yielded
to
the
pressing
solicitations
of
his
colleague
he
remarked
to
his
staff
that
he
had
made
the
englishman
go
down
on
his
knees
before
consenting
all
through
the
morning
hours
of
the
the
army
of
estremadura
was
pouring
across
the
bridge
and
the
fords
not
in
the
best
order
they
had
almost
all
passed
when
about
noon
the
french
cavalry
began
to
appear
in
their
front
when
the
enemy
at
last
began
to
press
forward
in
strength
wellesley
directed
sherbrooke
s
and
mackenzie
s
divisions
to
prepare
to
evacuate
their
positions
on
the
eastern
bank
which
they
did
as
soon
as
the
last
of
the
spaniards
had
got
into
safety
the
first
division
passed
at
the
bridge
the
third
at
the
fords
near
the
village
of
cazalegas
then
sherbrooke
marched
by
the
towards
talavera
while
mackenzie
who
had
been
told
off
as
the
rearguard
remained
with
anson
s
light
horse
near
the
ruined
casa
de
salinas
a
mile
to
the
west
of
the
alberche
it
may
seem
strange
that
wellesley
made
no
attempt
to
dispute
the
passage
of
the
river
but
the
ground
was
hopelessly
indefensible
the
left
bank
victor
s
old
position
of
july
completely
commands
the
right
the
one
being
high
the
other
both
low
and
entirely
destitute
of
artillery
positions
moreover
a
great
part
of
the
was
thickly
strewn
with
woods
and
olive
plantations
which
made
it
impossible
to
obtain
any
general
view
of
the
they
would
have
given
splendid
cover
for
an
army
advancing
to
storm
the
heights
on
the
french
bank
but
were
anything
but
an
advantage
to
an
army
on
the
defensive
for
unable
to
hold
the
actual
river
bank
because
of
the
commanding
hills
on
the
further
side
such
an
army
would
have
been
forced
to
form
its
line
some
way
from
the
water
and
the
tangled
cover
down
by
the
brink
of
the
stream
would
have
given
the
enemy
every
facility
for
pushing
troops
across
and
for
pressing
them
into
the
midst
of
the
defender
s
position
without
exposing
them
to
his
fire
wellington
had
examined
the
line
of
the
alberche
upon
the
and
and
had
pronounced
it
absolutely
untenable
no
position
could
be
worse
he
wrote
to
o
donoju
but
he
had
discovered
one
of
a
very
different
kind
a
little
to
the
rear
and
had
already
settled
the
way
in
which
it
was
to
be
occupied
it
presented
so
many
advantages
that
even
cuesta
had
consented
to
accept
it
as
a
good
and
the
estremaduran
army
was
at
this
very
moment
occupied
in
arraying
itself
along
that
part
of
the
line
which
had
been
allotted
to
it
sherbrooke
s
division
was
retiring
across
the
plain
to
fall
into
the
section
which
wellesley
had
chosen
for
it
and
hill
s
and
campbell
s
troops
were
moving
to
their
designated
ground
only
mackenzie
and
the
light
cavalry
had
yet
to
be
established
in
their
post
wellesley
to
o
donoju
from
cazalegas
july
in
the
act
of
withdrawing
this
division
became
involved
in
an
unfortunate
combat
which
bid
fair
for
a
moment
to
develop
into
a
disaster
its
two
brigades
had
been
halted
close
to
the
ruined
house
called
the
casa
de
salinas
in
ground
covered
partly
with
underwood
and
partly
with
olive
groves
the
cavalry
had
been
withdrawn
to
the
rear
as
it
was
impossible
to
use
it
for
vedettes
in
such
a
locality
the
infantry
was
supposed
to
have
a
chain
of
pickets
thrown
out
in
its
front
but
it
would
appear
that
they
must
have
been
badly
placed
as
one
confesses
we
were
by
no
means
such
good
soldiers
in
those
days
as
succeeding
campaigns
made
us
and
sufficient
precautions
had
not
been
taken
to
ascertain
what
was
passing
in
the
wood
and
between
it
and
the
ford
below
cazalegas
french
cavalry
alone
had
hitherto
been
seen
and
from
cavalry
mackenzie
s
troops
were
certainly
safe
in
the
tangled
ground
where
they
were
now
lying
lord
munster
but
already
victor
s
infantry
had
reached
the
front
and
its
leading
division
that
of
lapisse
had
forded
the
alberche
far
to
the
north
and
had
entered
the
woods
without
being
observed
by
the
outlying
pickets
of
mackenzie
s
left
brigade
it
had
even
escaped
the
notice
of
wellesley
himself
who
had
just
mounted
the
roof
of
the
ruined
casa
de
salinas
the
only
point
in
the
neighbourhood
from
which
anything
like
a
general
view
of
the
could
be
secured
while
he
was
intent
on
watching
the
heights
above
the
alberche
in
his
front
and
the
cavalry
vedettes
descending
from
them
the
enemy
s
infantry
was
stealing
in
upon
his
left
several
declare
that
lapisse
s
division
escaped
notice
owing
to
a
curious
chance
before
abandoning
the
further
bank
of
the
alberche
mackenzie
s
troops
had
set
fire
to
the
huts
which
victor
s
corps
had
constructed
on
the
cazalegas
heights
during
their
long
stay
in
that
position
the
smoke
from
the
burning
was
driven
along
the
slopes
and
the
river
bottom
by
the
wind
and
screened
one
of
the
fords
from
the
british
observers
in
the
woods
over
this
ford
came
lapisse
s
unsuspected
advance
lapisse
had
promptly
discovered
the
line
of
british
outposts
and
had
succeeded
in
drawing
out
his
division
in
battle
order
before
it
was
observed
he
had
deployed
one
regiment
the
léger
as
a
front
line
while
the
rest
of
his
twelve
battalions
were
coming
on
in
support
while
therefore
wellesley
was
still
unconscious
that
the
enemy
was
close
upon
him
a
brisk
fire
of
musketry
broke
out
upon
his
left
front
it
was
the
french
advance
driving
in
the
pickets
of
donkin
s
brigade
the
division
had
barely
time
to
stand
to
its
arms
some
men
are
said
to
have
been
killed
before
they
had
risen
from
the
ground
and
the
had
hardly
descended
from
the
roof
and
mounted
his
charger
when
the
enemy
was
upon
them
the
assault
fell
upon
the
whole
front
of
donkin
s
brigade
and
on
the
left
regiment
the
of
that
of
mackenzie
himself
so
furious
and
unexpected
was
it
that
the
and
were
all
broken
and
driven
some
way
to
the
rear
losing
about
eighty
prisoners
it
was
fortunate
that
the
french
advance
did
not
strike
the
whole
line
but
only
its
left
and
centre
the
which
was
just
outside
the
limit
of
lapisse
s
attack
stood
firm
and
on
it
wellesley
the
while
a
little
further
to
the
north
the
of
the
also
held
its
ground
and
served
as
a
for
the
and
the
steadiness
of
the
and
saved
the
situation
covered
by
them
the
division
retired
from
the
woods
and
formed
up
in
the
plain
where
anson
s
light
horsemen
came
to
their
aid
and
guarded
their
flanks
the
french
still
pressed
furiously
forward
sending
out
two
batteries
of
horse
artillery
to
gall
the
retreating
columns
but
they
had
done
their
worst
and
during
the
hours
of
the
late
afternoon
mackenzie
s
infantry
fell
back
slowly
and
in
order
to
the
points
of
the
position
which
had
been
assigned
to
them
donkin
s
brigade
took
post
in
the
second
line
behind
the
german
legion
while
mackenzie
s
own
three
regiments
passed
through
the
guards
and
formed

their
rear

total

the
combat

the
french
casualties
must
have
been
comparatively
insignificant
probably
not
in
all
unfortunately
the
french
returns
do
not
separate
the
losses
of
the
from
those
of
the
of
july
only
the
léger
can
have
suffered
any
appreciable
damage
from
the
moment
when

had
begun
in

woods
till
dusk
the
noise
of
battle
never
stopped
for
on
arriving
in
front
of
the
allied
position
the
french
artillery
drew
up
and
commenced
a
hot
but
not
very
effective
fire
against
those
of
the
troops
who
held
the
most
advanced
stations
as
the
cannonade
continued
the
different
regiments
were
seen
hurrying
to
their
for
although
the
arrangements
had
all
been
made
some
brigades
not
expecting
a
fight
till
the
morrow
had
still
to
take
up
their
allotted
ground
the
men
as
they
formed
and
faced
the
enemy
looked
pale
but
the
officers
riding
along
their
line
only
two
deep
on
which
all
our
hopes
depended
observed
that
they
appeared
not
less
tranquil
than
determined
in
the
meanwhile
the
departing
sun
showed
by
his
rays
the
immense
masses
moving
towards
us
and
the
last
glimmering
of
the
light
proved
their
direction
to
be
across
our
front
toward
the
left
the
darkness
only
broken
in
upon
by
the
bursting
shells
and
the
flashes
of
the
french
guns
closed
quickly
upon
us
and
it
was
the
opinion
of
many
that
the
enemy
would
rest
till

morning

such
however
was
not

wellesley
had
selected
as
offering

better
ground
for
a
defensive

than
any
which
could
be
found
on
the
banks
of
the
alberche
extends
for
nearly
three
miles
to
the
north
of
the
town
of
talavera
it
was
not
a
very
obvious
line
to
take
up
since
only
at
its
northern
end
does
it
present
any
well
marked
features
of
the
position
lie
in
the
plain
and
are
only
marked
out
by
the
stony
bed
of
the
portiña
a
brook
almost
dried
up
in
the
summer
which
runs
from
north
to
south
and
falls
into
the
tagus
at
talavera
in
the
northern
part
of
its
course
this
stream
flows
at
the
bottom
of
a
ravine
but
as
it
descends
towards
the
town
its
bed
grows
broad
and
shallow
and
ceases
to
be
of
any
tactical
or
topographical
importance
indeed
in
this
part
of
the
field
the
of
the

lay
across
it
and

posted

just
outside
the

gate
and
overlooking
the

and
the
neighbouring
gardens
the
place
had
no
suburbs
but
was
surrounded
by
a
broad
belt
of
olive
groves
and
enclosures
which
extend
for
a
full
mile
to
the
north
and
east
and
hide
the
houses
and
walls
from
the
traveller
approaching
from
either
of
those
directions
when
the
allies
entered
talavera
they
found
it
deserted
by
most
of
its
inhabitants
who
had
fled
up
into
the
villages
of
the
sierra
de
toledo
during
the
french
occupation
many
however
descended
to
reoccupy
their
homes
when
the
enemy
departed
victor
s
men
had
plundered
most
of
the
houses
and
turned
many
of
the
churches
into
barracks
or
stables
hence
the
town
presented
a
picture
of
abject
desolation
the
french
troops
during
their
stay
had
been
guilty
of
great
excesses
a
number
of
houses
were
completely
destroyed
and
the
furniture
burnt
for
fuel
in
every
quarter
were
to
be
seen
marks
of
the
devastation
they
had
committed
the
cathedral
a
handsome
modern
building
was
uninjured
the
enemy
having
contented
himself
with
carrying
off
all
the
splendid
ornaments
used
in
the
ceremonies
of
religion
but
in
the
church
of

the
french
had
destroyed

up
into

long
hill

from

so
that
its

commanding

been
chosen
by
wellesley
as

position

left
wing

formed

the
british
general
had
intended
at
first
that
his
position
should
extend
no
further
north
than
the
hill
but
in
the
course
of
the
action
he
was
compelled
to
lengthen
his
front
and
to
post
troops
both
in
the
valley
and
on
the
mountain
spurs
beyond
it
by
the
agreement
made
with

at
the
conference
near

bridge
of

the
evening
of

it
was
settled
that

army
should
hold

ground
for
a

had
their
right
among

olive
groves

their
centre

left
on

open
slopes

cerro
de
medellin
this
order
of

was
the
only
one
which
it
was
possible
to
adopt
wellesley
had
already
discovered
that
the
army
of
estremadura
could
not
manœuvre
and
would
be
much
safer
behind
walls
and
enclosures
than
in
the
open

cuesta
had
gladly
accepted
the
proposal
that
he
should
occupy
this
part
of
the
position
having
only
a
little
more

a

the
first
line
was
drawn
up
along
the
slightly
sunken
road
leading
from
talavera
to
the
north
which
provided
the
men
with
an
excellent
parapet
and
good
cover
the
second
line
was
equally
well
placed
behind
the
portiña
rivulet
which
was
bordered
by
trees
along
its
whole
front
the
only
good
artillery
position
was
that
outside
the
madrid
gate
in
front
of
zayas
division
but
three
other
batteries
were
planted
in
the
least
defective
emplacements
that
could
be
found
in
the
front
line
the
rest
of
the
spanish
guns
were
in
reserve
in
line
with
bassecourt
and
the
cavalry
cf
londonderry
i
and
arteche
vi
the
northern
half
of
the
position
had
its
strong
points
but
also
its
defects
for
the
first
half
mile
beyond
the
spanish
left
it
was
still
covered
by
groves
and
gardens
and
had
on
its
right
front
the
little
eminence
of
the
pajar
de
vergara
on
this
knoll
a
redoubt
had
been
commenced
but
no
more
had
been
done
than
to
level
a
space
eighty
yards
long
and
twenty
feet
broad
on
its
summit
and
to
throw
up
the
excavated
earth
in
front
thus
forming
a
bank
three
or
four
feet
high
in
this
work
indifferently
well
protected
lay
lawson
s
battery
of
the
lightest
guns
of
wellesley
s
artillery
beside
and
behind
them
were
the
five
battalions
of
the
division
campbell
s
brigade
in
the
front
line
kemmis
s
in
the
second
to
the
rear
of
the
portiña
on
the
left
of
the
division
the
enclosed
ground
ended
and
cover
ceased
here
forming
the
british
centre
were
drawn
up
the
eight
battalions
of
sherbrooke
s
division
in
a
single
line
the
guards
brigade
under
henry
campbell
was
in
perfectly
flat
level
ground
without
shade
or
cover
next
to
them
where
there
is
a
gentle
ascent
towards
the
foot
of
the
cerro
de
medellin
were
cameron
s
two
battalions
while
the
two
weak
brigades
of
the
king
s
german
legion
under
langwerth
and
low
continued
the
front
on
to
the
actual
hill
with
the
portiña
now
flowing
in
a
ravine
at
their
feet
the
whole
of
this
part
of
the
british
line
was
bare
rolling
ground
covered
with
long
dry
grass
and
scattered
shrubs
of
thyme
there
was
no
cover
and
before
the
guards
and
cameron
s
brigades
the
front
was
not
defined
by
any
strong
natural
feature
on
the
other
hand
the
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
portiña
was
equally
bare
and
gave
no
advantage
to
an
enemy
about
to
attack
thus
counting
from
right
to
left
the
front
of
sherbrooke
s
brigade
was
composed
as
follows
coldstream
guards
scots
fusilier
guards
line
ditto
ditto
ditto
it
was
otherwise
in
the
portion
of
the
front
where
the
four
german
battalions
of
langwerth
and
low
were
placed
they
had
a
steep
ravine
in
front
of
them
but
on
the
opposite
side
as
a
compensating
disadvantage
the
rolling
upland
swells
into
a
hill
called
the
cerro
de
cascajal
which
though
much
less
lofty
than
the
cerro
de
medellin
yet
afforded
good
artillery
positions
from
which
the
english
slopes
could
be
battered
behind
sherbrooke
s
troops
as
the
second
line
of
his
centre
wellesley
had
drawn
up
his
division
and
all
his
cavalry
cotton
s
light
dragoons
were
in
the
rear
of
kemmis
s
brigade
of
the
division
mackenzie
s
three
battalions
supported
the
guards
then
came
anson
s
light
and
fane
s
heavy
cavalry
massed
on
the
rising
slope
in
the
rear
of
cameron
lastly
donkin
s
brigade
which
had
suffered
so
severely
in
the
combat
of
casa
de
salinas
lay
high
up
the
hill
directly
in
the
rear
of
low
s
brigade
of
the
king
s
german
legion
it
only
remains
to
speak
of
the
british
left
on
the
highest
part
of
the
cerro
de
medellin
this
section
of
the
front
was
entrusted
to
hill
s
division
which
was
already
encamped
upon
its
reverse
slope
here
lay
the
strongest
point
of
the
position
for
the
hill
is
steep
and
well
covered
in
its
front
by
the
portiña
which
now
flows
in
a
deep
stony
ravine
but
it
was
also
the
part
of
the
british
which
was
most
likely
to
be
assailed
since
a
enemy
could
not
help
noting
that
it
was
the
key
of
the
whole
that
if
the
upper
levels
of
the
cerro
de
medellin
were
lost
the
rest
of
the
allied
line
could
not
possibly
be
maintained
it
was
therefore
the
part
of
the
position
which
would
require
the
most
careful
watching
and
wellesley
had
told
off
to
it
his
most
capable
and
experienced
divisional
general
but
by
some
miscalculation
on
the
evening
of
the
hill
s
two
brigades
were
not
lying
on
their
destined
but
had
halted
half
a
mile
behind
it
richard
stewart
s
battalions
on
the
left
tilson
s
on
the
right
flank
of
the
reverse
slope
it
is
difficult
to
see
with
whom
the
responsibility
lay
for
wellesley
was
far
to
the
right
engaged
in
planting
mackenzie
s
troops
in
their
new
position
behind
the
centre
while
hill
had
ridden
over
towards
talavera
to
search
for
his
and
question
him
about
details
and
returned
rather
late
to
give
his
brigadiers
the
exact
instruction
as
to
the
line
they
were
to
take
up
at
nightfall
there
were
piquets
on
the
crest
and
the
greater
part
of
the
front
slopes
were
covered
by
low
s
two
battalions
of
the
king
s
german
legion
but
the
actual
summit
of
the
cerro
was
not
occupied
by
any
solid
force
though
the
brigades
that
were
intended
to
hold
it
lay
only
yards
to
the
rear
it
was
supposed
that
they
would
have
ample
time
to
take
up
their
ground
in
the
morning
and
no
one
dreamt
of
the
possibility
of
a
night
attack
it
would
seem
on
the
whole
that
the
responsibility
for
the
absence
of
the
division
from
its
destined
lay
with
hill
generally
the
most
cautious
and
reliable
of
subordinates
he
says
in
a
memorandum
drawn
up
in
in
answer
to
an
inquiry
about
talavera
that
he
had
gone
to
dine
in
talavera
and
then
saw
mackenzie
s
division
come
back
into
the
line
returning
to
his
own
troops
he
found
them
moving
out
of
their
bivouac
but
not
on
their
he
was
getting
them
into
line
when
the
firing
suddenly
began
in
his
front
these
details
i
give
from
the
valuable
unpublished
map
by
lieut
unger
of
the
artillery
which
colonel
whinyates
has
been
good
enough
to
place
at
my
disposition
it
carefully
marks
the
emplacement
of
every
british
battery
elliott
was
at
this
moment
in
command
of
the
battery
which
had
been
under
baynes
during
the
oporto
campaign
while
sillery
had
that
which
had
been
under
lane
of
the
very
small
force
of
artillery
which
accompanied
the
british
army
we
have
already
seen
that
lawson
s
light
battery
had
been
placed
in
the
pajar
de
vergara
entrenchment
elliott
s
and
heyse
s
were
in
the
centre
of
the
line
the
former
placed
in
front
of
the
guards
the
latter
before
langwerth
s
brigade
of
the
german
legion
rettberg
s
heavy
were
on
the
cerro
de
medellin
with
hill
s
division
at
dusk
they
had
been
brought
back
to
its
rear
slope
and
were
parked
near
richard
stewart
s
brigade
finally
sillery
s
battery
was
in
reserve
between
the
two
lines
somewhere
behind
cameron
s
brigade
of
sherbrooke
s
division
this
single
unit
was
the
only
artillery
reserve
of
which
wellesley
could
dispose
the
precise
number
of
british
troops
in
line
was
after
deducting
the
losses
at
casa
de
salinas
that
of
the
spaniards
was
within
a
few
hundreds
of
the
french
as
we
have
already
seen
had
brought
a
little
more
than
men
to
the
field
so
that
the
allies
had
a
superiority
of
some
in
mere
numbers
if
wellesley
could
have
exchanged
the
army
of
estremadura
for
half
their
strength
of
british
bayonets
he
might
have
felt
quite
comfortable
in
his
strong
position
but
his
confidence
in
the
value
of
his
allies
even
when
firmly
planted
among
walls
and
groves
was
just
about
to
receive
a
rude
shock
it
was
about
seven
o
clock
when
the
heads
of
victor
s
columns
following
in
the
wake
of
the
horse
artillery
which
had
been
galling
mackenzie
s
retreat
emerged
from
the
woods
on
to
the
rolling
plateau
facing
the
allied
position
ruffin
appeared
on
the
right
and
occupied
the
cascajal
hill
opposite
the
cerro
de
medellin
villatte
followed
and
halted
in
its
rear
more
to
the
left
lapisse
adopting
the
same
line
that
had
been
taken
by
mackenzie
halted
in
front
of
the
british
centre
the
under
beaumont
was
drawn
up
in
support
of
him
s
six
regiments
of
dragoons
further
to
the
south
took
ground
in
front
of
the
spaniards
the
king
and
sebastiani
were
still
far
to
the
rear
their
infantry
was
only
just
passing
the
alberche
though
their
advanced
cavalry
under
merlin
was
already
pushing
forward
in
the
direction
of
talavera
down
the
from
madrid
all
these
details
are
from
the
report
drawn
up
by
sémélé
the
chief
of
the
staff
of
the
corps
at
talavera
on
if
napoleon
or
any
other
general
who
knew
how
to
make
himself
obeyed
had
been
present
with
the
french
army
there
would
have
been
no
fighting
on
the
evening
of
july
but
king
joseph
counted
for
little
in
the
eyes
of
his
nominal
subordinates
and
hence
it
came
to
pass
that
the
impetuous
victor
took
upon
himself
the
responsibility
of
attacking
the
allies
when
only
half
the
king
s
army
had
come
upon
the
field
with
no
more
object
as
it
would
seem
than
that
of
harassing
the
enemy
he
sent
to
the
front
the
batteries
belonging
to
ruffin
lapisse
and
to
join
in
the
cannonade
which
his
horse
artillery
had
already
begun
at
the
same
time
merlin
s
light
horse
pressed
forward
in
the
direction
of
talavera
to
feel
for
the
front
of
the
spaniards
whose
exact
position
was
hidden
by
the
olive
groves
the
british
artillery
replied
but
no
great
harm
was
done
to
either
side
yet
in
the
spanish
part
of
the
line
a
dreadful
disaster
was
on
the
point
of
occurring
when
the
artillery
fire
began
and
the
french
light
horse
were
seen
advancing
the
estremaduran
troops
between
talavera
and
the
pajar
de
vergara
delivered
a
tremendous
salvo
of
infantry
fire
along
the
whole
line
though
the
enemy
was
too
far
off
to
take
any
damage
but
immediately
after
four
battalions
of
portago
s
division
which
formed
part
of
the
left
of
cuesta
s
line
and
touched
campbell
s
right
suddenly
shouted
treason
broke
and
went
off
to
the
rear
in
complete
disorder
wellesley
who
as
it
chanced
was
behind
campbell
s
troops
and
witnessed
the
whole
rout
declared
that
he
could
conceive
no
reason
for
their
behaviour
except
that
they
must
have
been
frightened
by
the
crash
of
their
own
tremendous
volley
two
of
these
four
battalions
were
troops
who
had
never
been
in
action
before
the
other
two
had
been
badly
cut
up
at
medellin
and
brought
up
to
strength
by
the
incorporation
of
a
great
mass
of
recruits
this
might
have
excused
a
momentary
misconduct
but
not
a
prolonged
rush
to
the
rear
when
the
enemy
was
still
half
a
mile
off
still
less
the
casting
away
of
their
arms
and
the
plundering
of
the
british
camp
through
which
the
multitude
fled
cuesta
sent
cavalry
to
hunt
them
up
and
succeeded
in
hounding
back
the
majority
to
their
ranks
but
many
hundreds
were
still
missing
on
the
following
morning
they
fled
in
small
bands
all
down
the
valley
of
the
tagus
dispersing
dismal
information
on
all
sides
it
is
sad
to
have
to
acknowledge
that
in
their
rush
through
the
british
camp
they
carried
away
with
them
some
commissaries
and
a
few
of
the
baggage
guard
who
did
not
halt
till
they
got
to
oropesa
twenty
miles
from
the
field
strange
to
say
this
panic
had
no
appreciable
ill
effects
the
french
were
not
in
a
position
to
take
advantage
of
it
having
no
troops
save
a
few
light
horse
in
front
of
the
spot
where
it
occurred
the
spaniards
to
the
right
and
rear
of
the
absconding
regiments
did
not
flinch
and
as
the
second
line
held
firm
there
was
no
actual
gap
produced
in
the
allied
position
but
wellesley
noted
the
scene
and
never
forgot
it
of
all
that
he
had
witnessed
during
the
campaign
this
was
the
sight
that
struck
him
most
and
most
influenced
his
future
conduct
cuesta
also
took
account
of
it
in
his
own
fashion
and
at
the
end
of
the
battle
of
the
next
day
proposed
to
decimate
in
the
old
roman
fashion
the
battalions
that
had
fled
he
actually
chose
by
lot
some
men
from
the
fugitives
and
after
trying
them
by
prepared
to
shoot
them
his
british
colleague
begged
off
the
majority
but
the
old
insisted
on
executing
some
or
thirty
who
were
duly
put
to
death
on
the
morning
of
the
wellesley
to
castlereagh
two
thousand
of
them
ran
off
on
the
evening
of
the
not
yards
from
where
i
was
standing
who
were
neither
attacked
nor
threatened
with
an
attack
and
who
were
only
frightened
by
the
noise
of
their
own
fire
they
left
their
arms
and
accoutrements
on
the
ground
their
officers
went
with
them
and
they
plundered
the
baggage
of
the
british
army
which
had
been
sent
to
the
rear
many
others
went
whom
i
did
not
the
regiments
were
leales
de
fernando
vii
which
had
been
garrisoning
badajoz
when
medellin
was
fought
badajoz
two
batts
which
had
been
in
the
battle
and
toledo
i
wish
i
could
assert
with
truth
that
this
retrogression
was
confined
to
our
spanish
allies
but
the
truth
must
be
told
and
i
regret
to
say
that
stragglers
from
the
british
army
were
among
them
taking
a
similar
direction
to
the
rear
as
they
passed
they
circulated
reports
of
a
most
disheartening
leach
s
he
was
with
craufurd
s
brigade
then
coming
up
by
forced
marches
from
plasencia
which
met
the
fugitives
near
oropesa
on
the
morning
of
the
the
road
was
crowded
with
fugitives
spaniards
innumerable
and
lots
of
english
commissary
clerks
paymasters
and
sutlers
to
say
nothing
of
a
few
soldiers
who
said
they
were
of
sir
george
napier
early
in
the
morning
some
spanish
soldiers
dressed
in
white
attended
by
several
popish
priests
were
marched
up
to
the
front
of
our
regiment
and
shot
one
a
young
lad
of
nineteen
or
twenty
years
dropped
before
the
party
fired
but
to
no
use
for
after
the
volley
at
ten
paces
the
firing
party
ran
forward
and
shooting
them
in
the
head
or
breast
completed
their
horrid
work
these
unfortunates
belonged
to
regiments
that
had
given
way
in
the
late
of
cooper
of
the
fusiliers
pp
after
the
panic
had
died
down
victor
gradually
withdrew
his
batteries
but
it
was
with
no
intention
of
bringing
the
combat
to
a
real
termination
he
had
resolved
to
deliver
a
night
attack
on
the
key
of
the
british
position
when
the
whole
of
his
corps
should
have
reached
the
front
having
reconnoitred
the
allied
lines
and
noted
the
distribution
of
their
defenders
he
had
determined
to
storm
the
cerro
de
medellin
in
the
dark
during
his
long
stay
at
talavera
he
had
acquired
a
very
thorough
knowledge
of
its
environs
and
understood
the
dominating
importance
of
that
height
if
he
could
seize
and
hold
it
during
the
night
he
saw
that
the
battle
of
the
next
day
would
be
already
half
won
accordingly
still
without
obtaining
king
joseph
s
leave
he
determined
to
assail
the
cerro
he
told
off
for
the
storm
his
choicest
division
that
of
ruffin
whose
nine
battalions
were
already
ranged
on
the
front
of
the
cascajal
heights
at
the
same
time
lapisse
s
division
was
to
distract
the
attention
of
the
british
centre
by
a
noisy
demonstration
against
its
front
that
the
panic
took
place
at
dusk
and
not
during
the
night
attack
is
completely
proved
by
the
of
general
sémélé
where
it
is
noted
as
occurring
in
consequence
of
victor
s
earliest
demonstration
as
also
by
wellesley
s
note
night
attacks
are
proverbially
hazardous
and
hard
to
conduct
and
it
can
not
be
disputed
that
victor
showed
an
excessive
temerity
in
endeavouring
to
deliver
such
a
blow
at
the
steady
british
troops
at
an
hour
when
it
was
impossible
to
guarantee
proper
among
the
attacking
columns
but
for
an
initial
stroke
of
luck
he
ought
not
to
have
secured
even
the
small
measure
of
success
that
fell
to
his
lot
at
about
nine
o
clock
however
ruffin
moved
down
to
the
attack
each
of
his
three
regiments
was
formed
in
battalion
columns
the
léger
in
the
centre
the
on
its
left
the
on
its
right
the
regiment
was
to
deliver
a
frontal
attack
the
other
two
to
turn
the
flanks
of
the
hill
and
attack
over
its
at
the
appointed
moment
the
three
regiments
descended
simultaneously
into
the
ravine
of
the
portiña
and
endeavoured
to
carry
out
their
respective
sections
of
the
programme
the
chancing
on
the
place
where
the
ravine
was
most
easily
negotiable
crossed
it
without
much
difficulty
and
began
to
climb
the
opposite
slope
on
mounting
half
way
to
the
crest
it
suddenly
came
on
low
s
brigade
of
the
german
legion
lying
down
in
line
with
its
pickets
only
a
very
small
distance
in
advance
of
the
main
body
it
is
said
that
the
brigadier
was
labouring
under
the
delusion
that
some
of
hill
s
outposts
were
in
his
front
and
that
he
was
screened
by
them
it
is
at
any
rate
clear
that
he
was
taken
wholly
unprepared
by
the
midnight
attack
of
the
french
his
sentries
were
trampled
down
in
a
moment
and
the
léger
ran
in
upon
the
germans
firing
into
them
point
blank
and
seizing
many
of
them
as
prisoners
almost
ere
they
were
awake
the
was
completely
broken
and
lost
men
half
of
them
prisoners
in
five
minutes
the
the
battalion
of
low
s
brigade
came
off
better
as
it
was
not
in
the
direct
path
of
the
french
but
it
was
flung
sideways
along
the
southern
slope
of
the
hill
and
could
not
be
for
some
time
meanwhile
the
three
french
columns
somewhat
separated
from
each
other
in
this
first
clash
of
arms
went
straight
on
up
the
cerro
and
in
a
few
minutes
were
nearing
its
crest
the
two
leading
battalions
actually
reached
and
crowned
it
without
meeting
with
any
opposition
save
from
the
outlying
picket
of
richard
stewart
s
brigade
the
third
was
not
far
behind
and
it
seemed
almost
certain
that
the
position
might
be
won
at
this
moment
general
hill
who
was
occupied
in
drawing
out
his
division
on
the
rear
slope
but
had
not
yet
conducted
it
to
its
interfered
in
the
fight
he
had
seen
and
heard
the
sudden
outbreak
of
musketry
on
the
frontal
slopes
as
the
french
broke
through
low
s
brigade
but
when
it
died
down
he
was
far
from
imagining
that
the
cause
was
the
complete
success
of
the
enemy
nevertheless
he
directed
his
nearest
brigade
that
of
richard
stewart
to
prepare
to
support
the
germans
if
necessary
he
was
issuing
his
orders
to
the
colonel
of
the
when
he
observed
some
men
on
the
hill
top
fire
a
few
shots
in
his
direction
not
having
an
idea
he
writes
that
the
enemy
were
so
near
i
said
to
myself
that
i
was
sure
it
was
the
old
buffs
as
usual
making
some
accordingly
he
galloped
up
the
hill
with
his
fordyce
shouting
to
the
men
to
cease
firing
he
rode
right
in
among
the
french
before
he
realized
his
mistake
and
a
voltigeur
seized
him
by
the
arm
and
bade
him
surrender
hill
spurred
his
horse
which
sprang
forward
and
got
clear
of
the
frenchman
who
lost
his
hold
but
immediately
raised
his
musket
and
fired
at
three
paces
distance
missing
the
general
but
hitting
his
charger
hill
escaped
in
the
midst
of
a
scattering
volley
which
killed
his
companion
fordyce
and
got
back
as
fast
as
he
could
to
richard
stewart
s
brigade
without
delaying
for
a
moment
even
to
change
his
wounded
horse
he
led
on
the
nearest
regiments
to
recover
the
hill
top
so
great
was
the
confusion
owing
to
the
sudden
attack
in
the
dark
that
stewart
s
men
moved
forward
not
in
their
proper
order
but
with
the
battalion
of
detachments
on
the
right
the
in
the
centre
and
the
on
the
left
this
arrangement
brought
the
unit
first
into
touch
with
the
enemy
the
detachments
came
into
immediate
collision
with
the
leading
battalions
of
the
french
who
were
now
somewhat
in
disorder
and
trying
to
on
the
ground
they
had
won
the
two
forces
opened
a
furious
fire
upon
each
other
and
both
came
to
a
standstill
but
hill
coming
up
a
moment
later
at
the
head
of
his
centre
regiment
cleared
the
hill
top
by
a
desperate
charge
passing
through
the
detachments
the
delivered
a
volley
at
range
and
closed
the
enemy
broke
and
fled
down
the
slope
that
they
had
ascended
the
wheeled
into
line
and
followed
them
pouring
in
regular
volleys
at
short
intervals
but
before
they
had
gone
far
they
became
dimly
conscious
of
another
column
to
their
left
pushing
up
the
hill
in
the
darkness
this
was
the
rear
battalion
of
the
léger
which
had
fallen
somewhat
behind
its
fellows
it
was
moving
up
diagonally
across
the
front
of
the
british
regiment
with
drums
beating
and
loud
shouts
of
l
taken
in
flank
by
the
fire
of
the
right
companies
of
the
it
could
make
no
effective
resistance
and
ere
long
broke
and
rolled
back
in
disorder
into
the
bed
of
the
portiña
where
it
met
with
the
wrecks
of
the
rest
of
the
regiment
and
retired
in
company
with
them
up
the
slopes
of
the
cerro
de
cascajal
the
battalion
of
detachments
was
decidedly
checked
they
got
somewhat
into
confusion
and
halted
the
soldiers
seemed
much
vexed
writes
leslie
of
the
we
could
hear
them
bravely
calling
out
there
is
nobody
to
command
us
only
tell
us
what
to
do
and
we
are
ready
to
dare
there
was
a
fault
leslie
the
remainder
of
ruffin
s
division
took
little
or
no
part
in
the
fighting
the
three
battalions
of
the
which
ought
to
have
mounted
the
hill
on
the
right
lost
their
way
in
the
darkness
and
wandered
up
the
valley
between
the
cerro
de
medellin
and
the
northern
mountains
they
never
came
into
action
the
on
the
left
of
the
attack
chanced
upon
a
part
of
the
portiña
ravine
which
was
very
precipitous
they
found
it
difficult
to
descend
were
very
late
in
reaching
the
other
side
and
then
fell
into
a
futile
bickering
fight
with
the
and
battalions
of
the
king
s
german
legion
which
terminated
with
small
damage
to
either
party
when
the
main
attack
in
the
centre
was
seen
to
have
failed
the
loss
of
the
french
in
this
night
battle
was
about
men
almost
all
in
the
léger
it
included
prisoners
among
whom
was
the
colonel
of
the
regiment
who
was
left
on
the
ground
desperately
wounded
the
british
casualties
were
somewhat
heavier
entirely
owing
to
the
disaster
to
the
and
battalions
of
the
which
suffered
when
surprised
a
loss
of
men
of
whom
were
made
captives
richard
stewart
s
brigade
which
bore
the
brunt
of
the
fighting
and
decided
the
affair
had
only
killed
and
wounded
though
the
french
official
reports
of
casualties
do
not
give
any
officers
of
the
léger
as
prisoners
it
is
certain
that
colonel
meunier
was
taken
see
leslie
being
recovered
along
with
the
other
wounded
prisoners
when
talavera
was
evacuated
his
name
did
not
get
down
among
the
list
of
missing
which
was
only
drawn
up
on
thus
ended
in
failure
victor
s
night
attack
of
which
it
may
suffice
to
say
that
even
its
initial
success
was
only
due
to
the
gross
carelessness
of
low
s
brigade
in
failing
to
cover
their
front
with
a
proper
screen
of
outlying
pickets
to
attack
in
the
dark
across
rugged
and
difficult
ground
was
to
court
disaster
the
wonder
is
not
that
of
the
division
went
astray
but
that
the
other
third
almost
succeeded
in
the
hazardous
enterprise
to
which
it
was
committed
great
credit
is
due
to
the
léger
for
all
that
it
did
and
no
blame
whatever
rests
upon
the
regiment
for
its
ultimate
failure
the
marshal
must
take
all
the
responsibility
the
wrecks
of
the
french
attacking
columns
having
rolled
back
beyond
the
ravine
and
the
flanking
regiments
having
abandoned
their
futile
demonstrations
the
cerro
de
medellin
was
once
more
safe
the
troops
occupying
it
were
rearranged
as
far
as
was
possible
in
the
dark
the
front
line
on
its
left
and
highest
part
was
now
formed
by
richard
stewart
s
brigade
ranged
not
in
its
proper
order
of
seniority
but
with
the
on
the
left
the
battalion
of
detachments
in
the
centre
and
the
on
the
right
tilson
s
brigade
the
other
half
of
hill
s
division
was
to
the
south
of
stewart
continuing
his
line
along
the
crest
low
s
battalions
of
the
king
s
german
legion
were
drawn
off
somewhat
to
the
right
closing
in
towards
langwerth
s
brigade
so
as
to
leave
the
central
slopes
of
the
cerro
de
medellin
entirely
to
hill
s
men
donkin
s
brigade
of
mackenzie
s
division
lay
close
behind
them
after
the
warning
that
had
been
given
by
victor
s
first
assault
the
greatest
care
was
taken
to
make
a
second
surprise
impossible
stewart
s
and
low
s
brigades
threw
forward
their
pickets
to
the
brink
of
the
portiña
ravine
so
close
to
the
enemy
that
all
night
they
could
hear
the
of
the
sentries
challenging
the
visiting
rounds
only
two
or
three
hundred
yards
above
them
on
several
occasions
the
outposts
opened
fire
on
each
other
and
the
word
stand
to
your
arms
ran
along
the
whole
line
in
front
of
sherbrooke
s
division
about
midnight
there
was
a
false
alarm
which
led
to
a
whole
brigade
delivering
a
volley
at
an
imaginary
column
of
assault
while
their
own
pickets
were
still
out
in
front
with
the
result
that
two
officers
and
several
men
were
killed
or
wounded
a
similar
outbreak
of
fire
lasting
for
several
minutes
ran
along
the
front
of
the
spanish
lines
an
hour
later
it
seems
to
have
been
caused
by
french
foragers
in
search
of
fuel
blundering
against
the
estremaduran
pickets
on
the
edge
of
the
olive
groves
see
the
diary
of
boothby
of
the
one
of
the
victims
of
this
unhappy
fusilade
altogether
the
night
was
not
a
peaceful
one
and
the
troops
were
much
harassed
by
the
perpetual
and
unnecessary
calls
to
stand
to
their
arms
many
of
them
got
little
sleep
and
several
british
diarists
have
left
interesting
impressions
on
record
of
their
long
vigil
there
was
much
to
keep
them
awake
not
only
the
repeated
blaze
of
fire
running
along
parts
of
the
allied
line
but
the
constant
signs
of
movement
on
the
french
side
of
the
portiña
some
time
after
midnight
long
lines
of
torches
were
seen
advancing
across
and
to
the
right
of
the
cerro
de
cascajal
these
were
markers
with
flambeaux
sent
out
to
fix
the
points
on
which
victor
s
artillery
were
to
take
up
their
positions
as
was
soon
shown
by
the
rattling
of
the
noise
of
wheels
and
the
cracking
of
whips
which
were
plainly
heard
in
the
intervals
of
stillness
when
the
hostile
pickets
ceased
their
bickering
musketry
fire
the
french
were
pushing
up
their
guns
into
the
very
front
of
their
line
and
when
the
dawn
began
to
break
they
were
visible
only
or
yards
away
from
the
british
lines
a
few
deserters
came
over
during
the
night
mainly
from
leval
s
german
division
all
agreed
that
the
enemy
was
about
to
deliver
a
second
attack
in
the
early
morning
the
dawn
was
an
anxious
moment
with
the
growing
light
it
was
possible
to
make
out
broad
black
patches
dotting
the
whole
of
the
rolling
ground
in
front
of
the
british
army
every
instant
rendered
them
more
visible
and
soon
they
took
shape
as
french
regiments
in
battalion
columns
ranged
on
a
front
of
nearly
two
miles
from
the
right
end
of
the
cerro
de
cascajal
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
facing
the
pajar
de
vergara
the
object
which
drew
most
attention
was
an
immense
solid
column
at
the
extreme
right
of
the
hostile
line
on
the
lower
slopes
above
the
portiña
with
a
thick
screen
of
already
thrown
out
in
its
front
and
evidently
ready
to
advance
at
the
word
of
command
the
other
divisions
lay
further
back
in
front
of
them
artillery
was
everywhere
visible
there
were
four
batteries
on
the
midslope
of
the
cascajal
hill
and
six
more
on
the
rolling
ground
to
the
south
in
the
far
distance
behind
the
infantry
were
long
lines
of
cavalry
dressed
in
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
fifteen
or
sixteen
regiments
could
be
counted
and
far
to
the
rear
of
them
more
black
masses
were
slowly
rolling
into
view
it
was
easily
to
be
seen
that
little
or
nothing
lay
in
front
of
the
spaniards
and
that
at
least
of
the
french
army
was
disposed
for
an
attack
on
the
british
front
there
were
men
visible
ready
for
the
advance
against
the
sabres
and
bayonets
of
wellesley
s
long
red
line
there
are
admirable
narratives
of
the
and
the
dawn
of
talavera
in
the
narratives
of
leslie
and
lord
munster
an
attack
was
imminent
yet
there
were
many
things
which
might
have
induced
the
french
generals
to
hold
back
was
it
worth
while
to
assail
the
allies
in
the
admirable
position
which
they
now
held
when
it
was
possible
to
drive
them
out
of
it
without
risking
a
battle
orders
had
been
sent
to
soult
six
days
before
to
bid
him
fall
on
wellesley
s
communications
by
way
of
plasencia
it
was
believed
that
he
must
have
started
ere
now
and
that
the
news
of
his
approach
would
reach
the
enemy
within
the
next
hours
this
intelligence
would
compel
them
to
go
behind
the
tagus
and
to
abandon
the
talavera
position
both
jourdan
and
king
joseph
were
doubtful
of
the
policy
of
risking
a
general
action
but
the
initiative
was
taken
out
of
their
hands
by
victor
he
had
already
placed
his
corps
so
close
to
the
british
lines
that
it
would
have
been
hard
to
withdraw
it
without
an
engagement
he
had
also
during
the
night
sent
a
dispatch
to
the
king
stating
that
he
should
storm
the
cerro
de
medellin
at
dawn
unless
he
received
he
appeared
so
confident
of
success
that
joseph
and
his
adviser
jourdan
did
not
venture
to
bid
him
desist
they
were
as
the
latter
confessed
largely
influenced
by
the
knowledge
that
if
they
refused
victor
would
delate
them
to
the
emperor
for
culpable
timidity
in
letting
the
british
army
escape

free
to

the
whole
of
his

to
the
point

it
was
clear
that
the

at
about
five
in
the
morning
the
watchers
on

saw
the
smoke
of
a

curl
up
into
the

from

no

was
practicable

where

ground
presented
no

and
here
much
damage
was
done
after
a
few
minutes
the
english
position
was
obscured
for
the
damp
of
the
morning
air
prevented
the
smoke
from
rising
and
a
strong
east
wind
blew
it
across
the
portiña
and
drove
it
along
the
slopes
of
the
cerro
so
thick
was
the
atmosphere
that
the
defenders
heard
rather
than
saw
the
start
of

division
on
its
advance
and
only
realized
its
near
approach
when
they
saw
their
own
skirmishers
retiring
up
the
slope
towards
the
main
line
the
light
companies
of

s
division
came
in
so
slowly
and
unwillingly
turning
back
often
to
fire
and
keeping
their
order
with
the
regularity
of
a
the
general
wishing
to
get
his
front
clear
bade
the
bugles
sound
to
bring
them
in
more
quickly
and
as
they
filed
to
the
rear
in
a
leisurely
way
was
heard
to

occasion

at

to

had
better

out

were
at

visible
through

smoke
they
had
mounted
the

slopes
of

without

covered
by

artillery

only
ceased

his

delivered

as

there
was

the

rushed
like

down

and

in

operation
is
described
in
the
narrative
of

by

narrator
however
mistakes
the
french
regiment

number
and
says
for
ruffin

three
regiments
had
been
terribly
punished
they
had
lost
in
forty
minutes
fighting
killed
and
wounded
much
more
than
a
fourth
of
their
strength
hill
s
brigades
had
about
casualties
including
their
gallant
leader
who
received
a
wound
in
the
head
and
had
to
go
to
the
rear
leaving
the
command
of
his
division
to
tilson
the
loss
of
the
german
battalion
which
had
struck
in
upon
the
french
rear
was
insignificant
as
the
enemy
never
stood
to
meet
it
these
losses
can
be
accurately
ascertained
ruffin
s
whole
loss
in
the
two
days
of
fighting
was
of
whom
of
the
léger
had
fallen
on
the
night
of
july
he
was
not
seriously
engaged
during
the
rest
of
the
day
so
must
have
lost
in
this
fight
hill
s
total
loss
on
july
was
but
much
of
it
was
suffered
in
the
afternoon
when
though
not
attacked
by
infantry
his
division
was
under
a
heavy
shell
fire
thus
was
victor
s
second
attempt
to
storm
the
cerro
de
medellin
rebuked
it
was
a
rash
and
unscientific
operation
and
received
a
merited
chastisement
the
marshal
should
have
sent
in
all
his
corps
and
attacked
the
whole
british
line
if
he
wished
to
give
his
men
a
fair
chance
he
obviously
underrated
the
troops
with
which
he
had
to
deal
he
had
never
seen
them
before
the
combat
of
casa
de
salinas
on
the
previous
day
and
had
no
conception
of
the
power
of
the
line
against
the
column
even
now
baffled
rage
seems
to
have
been
his
main
feeling
and
his
only
desire
was
to
make
the
attempt
again
with
larger
forces
the
whole
engagement
had
taken
about
an
hour
and
a
half
and
the
morning
was
still
young
when
the
marshal
his
line
and
reported
his
to
the
king
after
the
cannonade
died
down
he
bade
his
men
take
their
morning
meal
and
the
british
on
the
cerro
could
see
the
whole
corps
turn
to
cooking
behind
their
strong
line
of
pickets
a
sort
of
informal
armistice
was
established
in
a
short
time
both
parties
wished
to
use
the
stagnant
water
of
the
portiña
and
after
a
little
signalling
hundreds
of
men
came
down
with
their
canteens
from
either
side
and
filled
them
with
the
muddy
fluid
in
spite
of
the
heavy
fighting
which
had
just
ended
all
parties
agree
that
a
very
friendly
spirit
was
shown
the
men
conversed
as
best
they
could
and
were
even
seen
to
shake
hands
across
the
pools
many
of
the
officers
came
down
a
little
later
and
after
a
short
colloquy
agreed
that
either
party
might
take
off
its
wounded
without
molestation
as
there
were
hundreds
of
french
lying
on
the
west
bank
of
the
portiña
and
a
good
many
english
on
its
further
side
there
was
a
complete
confusion
of
uniforms
as
the
bearers
passed
and
repassed
each
other
at
the
bottom
of
the
ravine
but
no
difficulties
of
any
sort
arose
and
for
more
than
two
hours
the
two
parties
were
completely
mixed
this
was
the
first
example
of
that
amicable
spirit
which
reigned
between
the
hostile
armies
all
through
the
war
and
which
in
its
later
years
developed
into
that
curious
code
of
signals
often
described
by
contemporaries
by
which
french
and
english
gave
each
other
notice
whenever
serious
work
was
intended
refraining
on
all
other
occasions
from
unnecessary

chapter
vii
the
battle
of
talavera
the
main
engagement
july
the
informal
armistice
which
had
followed
the
combat
of
the
early
morning
had
drawn
to
an
end
when
at
about
o
clock
the
british
observers
on
the
cerro
de
medellin
saw
a
large
and
brilliant
staff
riding
along
the
french
line
from
right
to
left
it
finally
halted
and
took
post
on
the
most
commanding
point
of
the
cascajal
heights
this
was
the
entourage
of
king
joseph
and
marshal
jourdan
who
had
determined
to
make
a
careful
examination
of
the
allied
lines
before
committing
themselves
to
any
further
action
when
they
halted
on
the
summit
of
the
hill
from
which
the
best
general
view
was
obtainable
victor
came
to
meet
them
and
a
council
of
war
was
held
it
soon
developed
into
a
lengthy
and
animated
dispute
lasting
for
more
than
an
hour
jourdan
was
of
opinion
that
considering
the
strength
of
the
hostile
position
and
the
decisive
way
in
which
the
corps
had
been
repulsed
it
would
be
unwise
to
proceed
with
another
attack
he
pointed
out
that
wellesley
would
now
be
perfectly
aware
that
his
left
was
the
point
which
must
be
assailed
and
that
movements
visible
behind
the
british
line
showed
that
it
was
already
being
reinforced
the
only
good
move
now
available
was
to
endeavour
to
turn
the
cerro
by
the
little
valley
to
its
which
separates
it
from
the
sierra
de
segurilla
but
it
was
clear
that
the
enemy
realized
this
as
well
as
themselves
a
considerable
body
of
cavalry
was
already
appearing
at
its
southern
end
if
the
duke
of
belluno
instead
of
delivering
two
frontal
assaults
had
been
prudent
enough
to
push
men
down
this
valley
under
cover
of
the
darkness
so
as
to
have
a
lateral
attack
ready
at
dawn
something
might
have
been
done
but
now
the
imperial
troops
would
have
to
win
the
valley
by
hard
fighting
before
they
could
use
it
as
a
for
the
assault
on
the
hill
if
a
general
attack
were
delivered
and
the
army
were
once
more
repulsed
it
risked
its
line
of
communication
and
its
retreat
on
madrid
for
the
whole
spanish
host
might
come
out
of
the
woods
and
fall
upon
its
flank
while
it
was
engaged
with
the
british
and
in
that
case
the
madrid
road
would
be
cut
and
the
king
would
have
to
retreat
on
avila
sacrificing
his
capital
and
his
arsenals
on
the
whole
jourdan
held
that
it
would
be
wise
and
prudent
to
assume
a
defensive
posture
and
either
to
hold
the
present
position
or
to
retire
to
the
more
favourable
ground
behind
the
alberche
four
miles
to
the
rear
in
a
few
days
the
enemy
would
hear
of
soult
s
operations
upon
their
line
of
communication
and
would
be
forced
to
break
up
and
retire
very
different
as
might
have
been
expected
were
victor
s
views
he
declared
that
the
british
position
was
far
from
impregnable
and
that
the
prestige
of
the
french
army
would
be
destroyed
if
it
retired
after
two
partial
checks
from
in
front
of
an
enemy
who
had
not
been
seriously
attacked
the
only
fault
in
the
preceding
operations
had
been
that
the
whole
army
had
not
joined
in
at
the
moment
when
the
cerro
had
been
stormed
if
the
king
would
undertake
to
use
the
corps
against
the
allied
centre
he
pledged
himself
to
break
their
right
with
his
own
three
divisions
of
infantry
he
would
not
only
assail
the
cerro
from
in
front
but
would
turn
it
from
both
flanks
if
such
an
attack
did
not
succeed
faudrait
renoncer
à
faire
la
this
phrase
he
dinned
into
joseph
s
and
jourdan
s
ears
so
repeatedly
that
they
both
saved
it
up
for
future
use
and
taunted
him
with
it
in
the
acrimonious
correspondence
which
followed
the
battle
king
joseph
would
have
preferred
to
follow
jourdan
s
cautious
plan
and
to
hold
back
sebastiani
whose
opinion
he
asked
agreed
with
him
but
both
seem
to
have
been
terrorized
by
the
marshal
s
stormy
tirades
and
still
more
by
the
thought
of
what
the
emperor
would
say
if
he
heard
that
battle
had
been
refused
contrary
to
victor
s
advice
the
ultimate
decision
was
still
in
the
balance
when
two
pieces
of
news
were
received
the
first
was
a
dispatch
from
general
valence
the
governor
of
toledo
to
effect
that
the
army
of
venegas
whose
position
had
hitherto
been
unknown
for
nothing
had
been
heard
of
him
since
sebastiani
had
escaped
from
his
front
had
at
last
come
on
the
scene
his
advanced
guard
had
presented
itself
before
the
bridges
of
toledo
and
was
already
skirmishing
there
the
second
item
of
intelligence
was
a
dispatch
from
soult
acknowledging
the
receipt
of
the
orders
which
had
been
sent
to
him
upon
the
and
stating
his
intention
of
carrying
them
out
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
but
he
complained
that
the
promised
train
of
artillery
had
not
yet
reached
the
corps
and
declared
that
he
could
not
move
till
it
had
come
to
hand
and
till
he
had
brought
down
the
corps
from
astorga
he
was
therefore
of
opinion
that
he
could
not
possibly
reach
plasencia
till
august
perhaps
not
till
two
days
later
this
news
was
decisive
it
was
now
clear
that
the
duke
of
dalmatia
would
not
be
able
to
bring
pressure
to
bear
upon
the
rear
of
the
allies
for
some
six
or
seven
days
meanwhile
venegas
was
within
two
marches
of
madrid
and
had
nothing
in
front
of
him
save
the
four
polish
battalions
at
toledo
if
the
king
refused
to
fight
and
took
up
a
defensive
position
on
the
alberche
he
would
have
to
detach
men
to
hold
back
the
army
of
la
mancha
from
the
capital
this
would
leave
him
with
only
men
to
resist
wellesley
and
cuesta
and
it
was
clear
that
such
a
force
would
be
overmatched
by
the
allies
if
he
kept
a
larger
number
in
their
front
venegas
would
be
able
to
capture
madrid
the
thing
of
all
others
which
joseph
was
resolved
to
prevent
accordingly
the
king
and
jourdan
reluctantly
fell
in
with
victor
s
plans
and
consented
to
fight
in
the
afternoon
if
they
defeated
the
british
and
the
estremadurans
on
the
the
army
of
la
mancha
could
easily
be
disposed
of
upon
the
or
thirtieth
this
decision
once
made
it
only
remained
to
settle
the
details
of
the
attack
the
king
determined
to
assail
the
british
centre
and
right
with
the
infantry
of
sebastiani
s
corps
battalions
in
all
or
some
men
victor
with
the
three
infantry
divisions
of
the
corps
battalions
still
over
strong
in
spite
of
their
losses
undertook
to
fall
upon
the
english
left
to
storm
the
cerro
de
medellin
and
also
to
turn
it
on
its
northern
side
so
as
to
envelop
wellesley
s
flank
the
spaniards
were
to
be
left
alone
behind
their
walls
and
orchards
only
milhaud
s
dragoons
were
told
off
to
watch
the
exits
from
talavera
of
the
rest
of
the
cavalry
a
few
could
be
utilized
in
victor
s
turning
movement
in
the
valley
below
the
sierra
de
segurilla
but
the
main
body
all
beaumont
s
and
s
eight
regiments
were
ranged
in
a
second
line
to
act
as
a
reserve
for
the
frontal
attack
of
the
infantry
and
to
aid
it
if
it
were
checked
the
king
s
guards
and
the
brigade
of
dessolles
were
to
be
kept
back
and
only
utilized
to
clinch
the
victory
or
to
retrieve
a
repulse
the
men
who
were
to
deliver
the
grand
assault
on
the
allied
position
were
drawn
up
as
follows
leval
s
germans
advanced
on
the
left
taking
as
their
objective
the
battery
on
the
pajar
de
vergara
they
faced
campbell
s
british
division
and
slightly
overlapped
it
so
as
to
cover
the
three
or
four
battalions
on
the
extreme
northern
wing
of
cuesta
s
line
in
their
rear
as
supports
followed
the
two
polish
battalions
from
valence
s
division
on
leval
s
right
sebastiani
s
four
french
regiments
continued
the
line
this
was
the
strongest
division
on
the
field
and
counted
over
bayonets
it
faced
the
guards
and
the
right
battalion
of
cameron
s
brigade
here
ended
the
troops
of
the
corps
beyond
them
victor
s
division
that
of
lapisse
was
about
to
assail
the
german
legion
and
cameron
s
regiment
the
still
further
north
villatte
s
division
lay
opposite
the
steepest
slopes
of
the
cerro
de
medellin
this
position
looked
more
formidable
in
the
eyes
of
the
duke
of
belluno
since
he
had
seen
his
first
two
assaults
upon
it
fail
it
was
now
heavily
manned
tilson
s
richard
stewart
s
and
donkin
s
brigades
were
all
visible
upon
its
crest
after
some
hesitation
the
marshal
resolved
to
leave
it
alone
for
the
present
and
not
to
attack
it
till
some
impression
should
have
been
made
upon
other
parts
of
wellesley
s
line
accordingly
he
left
in
front
of
it
only
villatte
s
second
brigade
the
six
battalions
of
the
and
regiments
the
other
brigade
the
and
was
directed
to
join
in
the
flanking
movement
to
the
north
of
the
cerro
which
was
to
encompass
wellesley
s
extreme
left
but
the
main
force
told
off
for
this
advance
consisted
of
the
remnants
of
ruffin
s
division
now
not
more
than
strong
the
employment
of
these
troops
for
such
a
critical
operation
seems
to
have
been
a
mistake
they
had
already
received
two
bloody
checks
and
had
lost
more
than
a
third
of
their
officers
and
men
in
the
late
fighting
though
good
regiments
they
could
now
be
considered
as
little
more
than
a
spent
this
fact
sufficiently
explains
the
feebleness
of
the
french
advance
upon
this
part
of
the
field
during
the
afternoon
hours
behind
the
french
infantry
of
the
and
corps
were
deployed
no
less
than
twelve
regiments
of
horse
s
three
brigades
of
dragoons
were
drawn
up
in
the
rear
of
lapisse
and
sebastiani
beaumont
supported
villatte
and
lastly
the
four
regiments
of
merlin
s
late
lasalle
s
division
followed
ruffin
in
his
turning
movement
far
to
the
rear
dessolles
and
joseph
s
guards
took
up
a
position
facing
the
british
centre
from
which
they
could
support
the
right
or
the
left
of
their
own
front
line
as
might
be
necessary
the
drawing
up
of
this
line
of
battle
took
time
and
while
the
french
were
shifting
their
positions
and
establishing
their
new
front
wellesley
had
ample
leisure
to
provide
against
the
oncoming
storm
he
had
established
himself
upon
the
crest
of
the
cerro
and
from
thence
could
overlook
every
movement
of
the
enemy
of
the
new
dispositions
the
only
one
which
struck
him
as
likely
to
cause
trouble
was
the
extension
of
ruffin
and
villatte
to
the
northward
it
was
clear
that
they
were
intending
to
advance
up
the
valley
that
separates
the
sierra
de
segurilla
from
the
cerro
de
medellin
in
order
to
take
the
hill
in
the
flank
and
assail
the
division
from
the
side
it
was
therefore
necessary
to
make
arrangements
for
checking
this
manœuvre
wellesley
s
first
order
was
that
fane
s
and
anson
s
cavalry
should
move
round
the
back
of
the
cerro
and
take
up
new
ground
at
the
head
of
the
valley
from
this
position
they
would
be
able
to
charge
in
the
flank
any
force
that
might
push
up
the
trough
of
the
depression
in
order
to
get
behind
hill
s
line
he
also
withdrew
half
rettberg
s
battery
from
the
front
of
the
height
and
placed
it
on
a
projecting
lateral
spur
from
which
it
could
enfilade
the
valley
nor
were
these
his
only
precautions
he
sent
a
hasty
message
to
cuesta
pointing
out
that
the
greater
part
of
the
spanish
line
was
not
threatened
and
asking
if
he
could
spare
reinforcements
for
the
left
wing
the
spanish
general
behaved
in
a
more
liberal
fashion
than
might
have
been
expected
from
his
previous
conduct
he
consented
to
lend
wellesley
his
reserve
division
that
of
bassecourt
about
strong
and
also
put
at
his
disposition
a
battery
of
heavier
guns
than
any
which
the
british
army
possessed
the
french
were
so
slow
in
moving
that
there
was
ample
time
before
the
battle
grew
hot
to
send
bassecourt
s
division
round
the
rear
of
the
british
line
and
to
place
it
on
the
lower
slopes
of
the
sierra
de
segurilla
so
as
to
continue
to
the
northward
the
front
formed
by
the
british
cavalry
of
the
spanish
guns
placed
at
wellesley
s
disposition
four
were
put
into
the
pajar
de
vergara
redoubt
by
the
side
of
lawson
s
battery
the
other
two
accompanied
bassecourt
s
infantry
and
were
placed
on
the
northern
spur
of
the
cerro
de
medellin
near
rettberg
s
somewhat
later
the
duke
of
albuquerque
brought
round
the
whole
of
his
cavalry
division
six
regiments
and
a
battery
to
the
same
quarter
and
drew
them
up
in
two
lines
to
the
rear
of
anson
s
and
fane
s
brigades
but
before
he
arrived
the
battle
had
already
begun
when
the
whole
of
the
french
infantry
was
ready
at
about
two
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
the
king
gave
orders
for
the
artillery
to
open
and
eighty
guns
of
the
and
corps
began
to
play
upon
the
british
line
in
some
places
the
troops
were
only
some
yards
from
the
enemy
s
batteries
and
the
loss
in
many
regiments
was
very
appreciable
before
a
single
musket
had
been
fired
only
thirty
british
and
six
spanish
pieces
could
reply
they
were
overwhelmed
from
the
first
by
the
superior
number
of
the
french
guns
it
was
therefore
with
joy
that
wellesley
s
infantry
saw
that
the
artillery
engagement
was
not
to
last
for
long
all
along
the
hostile
line
the
of
ruffin
lapisse
sebastiani
and
leval
were
moving
up
to
the
attack
and
when
they
reached
the
front
and
threw
out
their
screen
of
tirailleurs
the
guns
grew
silent
only
from
the
cerro
de
cascajal
where
villatte
was
hanging
back
in
obedience
to
victor
s
orders
did
the
cannonade
against
hill
s
brigades
continue
the
first
troops
to
come
into
collision
with
the
allies
were
leval
s
germans
upon
the
extreme
left
of
the
french
line
this
it
is
said
was
contrary
to
the
king
s
orders
he
had
intended
to
hold
this
division
somewhat
back
as
it
was
in
danger
of
being
outflanked
by
the
spaniards
if
it
made
a
premature
advance
but
leval
had
a
tangled
terrain
of
vines
and
olive
groves
in
his
front
when
once
he
had
entered
it
he
lost
sight
of
the
troops
on
his
right
and
fearing
to
be
late
on
account
of
the
obstacles
in
his
front
committed
the
opposite
fault
he
came
rushing
in
upon
campbell
s
outpost
line
half
an
hour
before
the
other
divisions
had
closed
with
the
british
centre
the
time
being
then
in
the
afternoon
see
jourdan
s
the
nine
battalions
of
the
german
division
were
arrayed
in
a
single
line
of
battalion
columns
with
a
thick
screen
of
tirailleurs
in
their
front
but
their
order
had
been
so
much
broken
up
by
the
walls
and
thickets
that
the
bayonets
appeared
to
the
british
like
one
confused
mass
of
skirmishers
they
came
on
fast
and
furiously
chasing
the
pickets
of
the
and
before
them
till
they
emerged
into
the
comparatively
open
ground
in
front
of
the
pajar
de
vergara
here
the
defence
was
standing
ready
for
them
campbell
had
brought
up
one
battalion
of
his
rear
brigade
into
his
front
line
so
that
the
as
well
as
the
and
were
facing
the
attack
on
his
right
lay
the
redoubt
with
its
ten
guns
further
to
the
south
the
two
units
of
the
french
division
were
opposed
to
troops
of
cuesta
s
army
hence
it
came
that
while
the
nassau
and
dutch
regiments
faced
the
british
infantry
the
baden
regiment
was
in
front
of
the
guns
while
the
hessians
and
the
frankfort
battalion
had
to
do
with
the
spaniards
their
order
from
left
to
right
was
as
follows
two
batts
baden
two
batts
holland
two
batts
nassau
two
there
is
a
legend
which
occurs
in
all
french
narratives
of
talavera
starting
with
the
contemporary
accounts
and
including
desprez
s
and
jourdan
s
it
is
to
the
effect
that
leval
s
division
in
its
first
advance
came
upon
an
english
battalion
which
several
writers
call
the
lying
in
front
of
the
rest
of
the
allied
line
it
is
alleged
that
the
nassau
regiment
surrounded
and
almost
captured
it
that
they
would
have
taken
it
prisoner
indeed
if
the
troops
on
their
left
holland
and
baden
had
held
firm
but
at
least
on
lui

et
le

de
ses
blessures
jourdan
no
such
incident
can
have
occurred
for
no
english
regiment
lost
more
than
missing
on
this
side
of
the
field
no
english
officer
of
higher
rank
than
a
captain
was
taken
prisoner
in
the
battle
only
one
officer
was
killed
in
the
whole
of
campbell
s
division
and
he
was
a
lieutenant
of
the
fusiliers
the
was
not
engaged
with
leval
s
men
but
lay
to
the
left
and
supported
the
guards
in
resisting
sebastiani
it
lost
one
officer
a
captain
and
twelve
men
missing
but
this
was
in
the
great
in
the
centre
at
the
end
of
the
day
s
fighting
it
had
no
officer
killed
i
am
driven
to
conclude
that
the
whole
is
some
gross
exaggeration
of
the
surprise
of
campbell
s
pickets
in
the
vineyards
and
that
instead
of
a
battalion
we
should
read
the
light
companies
of
the
division
cooper
of
the
fusiliers
who
was
in
the
skirmishing
line
says
that
the
germans
got
close
among
them
by
calling
out
españoles
and
pretending
to
be
spaniards
a
few
prisoners
in
all
were
lost
in
this
way
when
the
germans
surged
out
from
among
the
olive
groves
into
the
comparatively
open
ground
in
front
of
the
pajar
de
vergara
the
musketry
opened
along
both
lines
at
a
distance
of
about
yards
the
assailants
delivering
a
rolling
fire
while
the
defenders
of
the
position
answered
with
regular
battalion
volleys
several
times
leval
s
men
advanced
a
few
score
paces
and
the
distance
between
the
two
divisions
was
growing
gradually
less
but
the
attacking
force
was
evidently
suffering
more
than
the
allies
in
the
centre
especially
where
the
ten
guns
of
the
redoubt
were
firing
canister
into
the
disordered
mass
the
casualties
of
the
baden
battalions
were
terrible
they
could
not
bear
up
against
the
blasts
of
and
after
their
colonel
von
porbeck
had
fallen
they
broke
and
began
to
recoil
seeing
part
of
the
enemy
s
line
falling
into
disorder
general
campbell
ordered
his
front
line
to
charge
then
colonel
myers
of
the
seizing
the
king
s
colour
of
his
regiment
ran
out
in
front
of
the
line
and
calling
come
on
fusiliers
led
the
advance
his
own
battalion
the
and
the
at
once
closed
with
the
nassau
and
dutch
regiments
who
shrank
back
into
the
thickets
and
melted
away
from
the
front
the
victors
pursued
them
for
some
distance
capturing
in
their
onward
career
a
whole
battery
of
six
guns
which
was
being
brought
forward
to
reply
to
the
artillery
of
the
redoubt
but
had
failed
to
reach
the
clearing
before
the
line
in
front
of
them
gave
way
the
three
battalions
on
leval
s
extreme
left
which
had
the
spaniards
in
front
of
them
had
been
exchanging
volleys
with
their
opponents
without
notable
advantage
on
either
side
when
the
rest
of
the
division
broke
when
their
companions
retired
they
also
were
forced
to
draw
back
in
order
to
prevent
themselves
from
being
turned
on
both
flanks
campbell
was
cautious
enough
to
stop
his
men
before
they
had
gone
far
forward
among
the
thickets
and
brought
them
back
to
their
old
position
he
spiked
the
guns
that
he
had
taken
and
left
them
in
the
clearing
in
front
of
the
redoubt
his
losses
had
been
very
small
owing
to
his
admirable
in
calling
back
his
charging
regiments
before
they
got
out
of
hand
this
was
the
myers
who
fell
in
storming
the
famous
hill
of
albuera
in
see
cooper
of
the
leval
therefore
was
able
to
rally
his
division
at
leisure
upon
the
two
polish
battalions
which
formed
its
supports
he
had
lost
in
the
of
an
hour
during
which
he
was
engaged
some
six
or
seven
hundred
men
the
battle
was
raging
by
now
all
down
the
line
and
when
the
germans
were
they
received
orders
to
advance
for
a
second
time
to
cover
the
flank
of
sebastiani
s
division
now
hotly
engaged
with
sherbrooke
s
right
brigades
neglecting
chronological
considerations
in
order
to
finish
the
narrative
of
the
action
in
this
quarter
it
may
suffice
to
say
that
leval
s
second
attack
was
made
at
about
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
it
was
not
delivered
with
so
much
energy
as
had
been
shown
in
his
first
it
encountered
the
same
obstacles
and
could
not
surmount
them
once
more
the
advance
rolled
up
through
the
olive
groves
and
reached
the
clearing
in
front
of
the
battery
again
the
head
of
the
attacking
masses
withered
away
under
the
musketry
fire
and
the
salvos
from
the
english
and
spanish
guns
and
the
whole
finally
went
to
the
rear
in
disorder
campbell
in
repelling
this
attack
used
his
second
brigade
as
well
as
his
first
and
pushed
the
enemy
further
back
than
he
had
done
during
the
earlier
fighting
the
spaniards
also
came
out
of
their
line
and
continued
to
flank
the
retreating
enemy
with
two
or
three
battalions
and
a
as
the
hessians
and
frankforters
in
their
front
began
to
give
way
they
were
assailed
by
one
of
henestrosa
s
cavalry
regiments
the
del
which
charged
with
great
spirit
and
cut
up
many
men
before
they
could
form
square
the
bulk
of
the
two
battalions
however
clubbed
together
in
a
mass
and
retired
into
the
woods
defending
themselves
as
best
they
could
the
victorious
spanish
horsemen
while
following
them
came
upon
a
second
french
battery
which
like
that
captured
by
the
british
brigade
on
their
left
was
being
brought
forward
by
a
narrow
lane
between
two
olive
groves
they
cut
down
the
gunners
and
took
four
pieces
which
were
dragged
back
into
the
redoubt
this
was
by
far
the
best
piece
of
work
done
by
spanish
cavalry
during
the
whole
of
the
first
years
of
the
war
and
did
much
to
atone
for
the
panic
of
the
previous
night
in
the
eyes
of
the
british
observers
upon
the
right
wing
another
lull
in
the
storm
and
fresh
formation
here
they
come
again
said
many
voices
so
they
did
but
we
were
ready
and
gave
them
such
a
warm
reception
that
they
speedily
went
to
the
as
in
their
first
attack
they
now
left
behind
several
pieces
of
cannon
which
we
secured
as
before
after
these
two
attacks
and
sharp
repulses
we
were
not
troubled
with
their
company
any
cooper
the
repulse
of
leval
s
division
was
complete
and
its
wrecks
once
more
rallied
upon
the
two
polish
battalions
in
their
rear
drew
back
into
the
plain
and
were
completely
put
out
of
action
in
this
attack
they
lost
not
only
the
four
guns
taken
by
the
spaniards
but
seven
more
pieces
of
artillery
convinced
that
he
could
not
carry
the
pajar
de
vergara
position
unless
he
could
bring
guns
to
bear
upon
the
redoubt
and
check
the
ravages
of
its
salvos
of
canister
leval
had
tried
to
push
his
remaining
two
batteries
into
the
firing
line
again
as
in
the
first
attack
they
were
left
helpless
when
the
infantry
broke
and
became
the
prey
of
the
pursuers
it
would
seem
that
he
lost
on
this
day
seventeen
guns
in
all
the
total
of
the
casualties
in
his
division
were
nearly
a
quarter
of
its
force
the
colonels
of
the
baden
and
frankfort
regiments
and
the
major
commanding
the
dutch
battery
had
been
left
on
the
field
campbell
had
suffered
on
a
very
different
scale
he
had
only
lost
men
and
it
is
improbable
that
the
spaniards
on
his
right
had
more
than
or
casualties
since
they
only
fought
with
one
wing
of
the
attacking
force
wellesley
not
without
reason
gave
the
highest
praise
in
his
dispatch
to
campbell
for
the
admirable
and
cautious
defence
which
he
had
made
the
management
of
the
division
indeed
contrasted
strongly
with
that
of
the
troops
to
its
left
where
sherbrooke
s
brigades
as
we
shall
see
risked
the
loss
of
the
battle
by
their
rash
pursuit
of
the
enemy
far
beyond
the
limits
of
the
position
which
had
been
given
them
to
defend
there
can
be
no
rational
doubt
that
the
total
number
of
guns
taken
was
seventeen
as
set
forth
in
charles
stewart
s
report
to
wellesley
as
viz
four
four
one
one
howitzer
taken
by
campbell
s
brigade
with
one
howitzer
and
six
other
guns
left
by
the
enemy
and
found
in
the
woods
of
which
four
were
in
the
hands
of
the
spaniards
wellesley
in
his
dispatch
made
the
error
of
stating
that
twenty
guns
had
been
taken
being
under
the
impression
that
the
spaniards
had
captured
seven
pieces
while
they
themselves
only
claim
four
a
captain
piñero
was
mentioned
in
eguia
s
dispatch
for
causing
them
to
be
brought
back
to
the
spanish
line
the
british
took
thirteen
guns
three
days
after
the
battle
wellesley
made
them
over
to
his
allies
he
writes
to
o
donoju
talavera
we
have
got
thirteen
pieces
of
french
artillery
which
i
wish
to
give
over
to

the

you

is

the
most
interesting
point
of
the
controversy
comes
out
in
napoleon

correspondence
with
his
brother
joseph
on
the
emperor
writes
in
hot
anger
to
say
that
he
sees
from
the
english
newspapers
that
joseph
had
lost
twenty
guns

fact
concealed
in
the

dispatch
he
desires
to
be
told
at
once
the
names
of
the
batteries
that
were
captured
and
the
divisions
to
which
they
belonged
jourdan
replies
in
the
king
s
behalf
on
that
guns
have
been
lost
four
pieces
of
leval
s
artillery
had
been
for
a
moment
in
the
hands
of
the
british
but
they
were
recaptured
joseph
himself
writes
to
the
same
effect
next

on
the
nineteenth
jourdan
writes
to
clarke
the
minister
of
war
to
say
that
he
has
just
found
out
that
guns
had
been
lost
by
leval
sénarmont
the
artillery
chief
of
the
corps
explains
to
jourdan
in
a
letter
of
september
that
pieces
had
been
lost
in
the
olive
groves
but
that
all
were
recovered
save
one
dutch
and
one
french
the
truth
comes
out
in
desprez
s
narrative
he
says
that
the
king
hearing
that
leval
had
left
guns
abandoned
in
front
of
the
pajar

ordered
sebastiani
to

in
short
sebastiani
and
sénarmont
conspired
to
hide
the
truth
and
joseph
who
liked
them
both
see
his
letters
in
ducasse
especially

where
on
he
sends
sénarmont
a
gold
box
as
a
sort
of
consolation
prize
hushed
the
matter
up
in
their
interests
the
most
curious
part
of
the
matter
is
that
on
sénarmont
was
able
to
say
with
literal
exactness
that
only
two
pieces
were
missing
for
fifteen
of
the
lost
guns
had
been
retaken
on
august
behind
the
bridge
of
arzobispo
during
the
retreat
of
cuesta
s
army
they
had
been
given
back
to
their
owners
long
before
september
so
were
no
longer
missing
but
this
can
hardly
be
called
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
the
losses
were
killed

six
men
wounded
officers

prisoners
men
campbell
lost

officers
six

officers
one
men
a
total
of
the
spaniards
may
have
had
casualties
it
is
difficult
to
see
that
they
can
have
suffered
much
more
as
they
had
only
two
hostile
regiments
in
front
of
them
we
must
now
turn
to
their
doings
the
most
desperate
fighting
that
occurred
during
the
day
sherbrooke
s
eight
battalions
had
to
endure
the
preliminary
cannonade
for
more
than
half
an
hour
after
campbell
s
men
were
closely
engaged
with
the
enemy
it
was
not
till
three
o
clock
that
the
two
french
divisions
opposed
to
them
began
to
descend
towards
the
portiña
in
an
orderly
and
imposing
array
each
of
the
french
generals
had
drawn
up
his
twelve
battalions
in
two
lines
the
front
line
deployed
in
column
of
divisions
the
supporting
line
in
solid
column
of
battalions
but
there
was
this
difference
in
their
arrangements
that
lapisse
had
placed
his
brigades
one
behind
the
other
while
sebastiani
had
preferred
to
work
his
brigades
side
by
side
each
with
one
regiment
in
first
and
one
in
second
line
the
former
therefore
had
laplannes
brigade
léger
and
line
opposed
to
low
s
and
langwerth
s
regiments
of
the
german
legion
and
cameron
s
the
latter
had
the
of
rey
s
and
the
of
s
brigades
ranged
over
against
the
and
the
british
when
the
cannonade
of
the
french
batteries
ceased
the
twelve
battalions
of
their
first
line
preceded
by
the
usual
swarm
of
moved
down
toward
the
portiña
they
crossed
the
brook
and
pressed
on
towards
the
red
line
that
stood
awaiting
their
approach
driving
before
them
with
ease
the
comparatively
insignificant
screen
of
light
troops
that
lay
in
front
of
the
british
centre
sherbrooke
who
was
responsible
for
the
whole
line
of
the
defence
since
his
division
exactly
covered
the
ground
on
which
the
french
attack
was
delivered
had
issued
orders
that
the
troops
were
not
to
fire
till
the
enemy
came
within
fifty
yards
of
them
and
that
they
were
then
to
deliver
a
single
volley
and
charge
this
programme
was
executed
with
precise
obedience
though
suffering
severely
from
the
enemy
s
musketry
the
division
held
in
its
fire
till
the
hostile
columns
were
close
upon
them
and
then
opened
with
one
tremendous
discharge
which
crashed
out
simultaneously
along
the
whole
eight
battalions
the
leading
ranks
of
lapisse
s
and
sebastiani
s
front
line
went
down
in
swathes
one
french
witness
says
that
the
infantry
of
the
regiments
of
the
corps
lost
a
third
of
their
numbers
in
less
than
ten
minutes
when
the
charge
which
sherbrooke
had
ordered
followed
close
upon
the
blasting
musketry
fire
the
enemy
retired
in
disorder
and
fell
back
beyond
the
portiña
the
divisional
general
had
apparently
forgotten
to
caution
his
colonels
against
the
danger
of
carrying
their
advance
too
far
instead
of
contenting
themselves
with
chasing
the
broken
enemy
as
far
as
the
brook
and
then
returning
to
their
positions
the
four
brigades
of
the
division
all
crossed
the
water
and
pursued
the
french
into
their
own
ground
the
german
legion
on
the
left
actually
began
to
push
them
up
the
lower
slopes
of
the
cerro
de
cascajal
while
the
guards
on
the
right
went
forward
far
into
the
rolling
plain
in
front
of
them
cameron
halted
his
two
battalions
not
far
beyond
the
portiña
but
on
each
side
of
him
the
pursuit
was
pressed
with
reckless
energy
and
without
any
remembrance
of
the
fact
that
the
enemy
had
strong
reserves
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
a
disaster
followed
the
first
success
of
sherbrooke
s
division
both
the
germans
on
the
left
and
the
guards
on
the
right
found
themselves
in
face
of
intact
troops
behind
whom
the
broken
front
line
of
the
enemy
took
refuge
they
were
in
no
condition
to
begin
a
new
combat
for
they
were
in
complete
disorder
and
there
was
a
broad
gap
on
the
inner
flank
of
each
brigade
owing
to
the
fact
that
cameron
had
halted
and
refused
to
push
forward
into
danger
hence
came
a
perilous
crisis
the
french
reserves
moved
forward
the
guns
on
the
cascajal
height
enfiladed
the
german
legion
while
two
regiments
of
s
dragoons
moved
in
upon
the
right
flank
of
the
guards
the
whole
of
the
six
battalions
that
had
joined
in
the
reckless
advance
were
forced
to
recoil
fighting
desperately
but
losing
ground
every
moment
and
pressed
into
clumps
and
masses
that
presented
no
trace
of
their
former
line
of
battle
when
they
fell
back
to
the
point
where
cameron
had
stopped
the
and
became
involved
in
their
retreat
and
were
forced
to
repass
the
portiña
in
their
company
the
french
followed
with
shouts
of
victory
pushing
their
advantage
to
the
utmost
and
slaughtering
the
disordered
battalions
by
hundreds
the
disaster
was
worst
on
the
left
where
half
the
strength
of
the
line
battalion
of
the
german
legion
men
was
destroyed
in
twenty
minutes
and
the
battalion
of
that
same
corps
lost
over
prisoners
the
guards
suffered
almost
as
heavily
out
of
their
men
went
down
killed
or
wounded
but
they
left
no
prisoners
behind
it
seemed
that
the
day
might
well
be
lost
for
wellesley
s
reserves
were
small
such
as
they
were
however
they
were
at
once
put
into
action
mackenzie
brought
forward
his
brigade
to
the
ground
which
the
guards
had
originally
covered
and
drew
them
up
to
withstand
the
rush
of
sebastiani
s
division
the
on
the
right
the
on
the
left
with
the
between
them
the
disordered
household
troops
passed
through
their
intervals
and
rallied
behind
them
with
splendid
promptness
their
good
humour
and
determination
after
such
dreadful
losses
says
an
was
shown
by
their
giving
a
loud
hurrah
as
they
took
up
their
new
ground
at
the
same
time
cotton
brought
up
the
single
brigade
of
light
cavalry
which
was
in
reserve
and
drew
them
up
on
mackenzie
s
right
so
as
to
cover
his
flank
sebastiani
came
up
with
great
boldness
against
the
fresh
front
thus
presented
to
him
and
for
twenty
minutes
there
was
a
furious
musketry
battle
in
the
british
right
centre
mackenzie
himself
fell
and
his
three
battalions
lost
men
out
of
about
but
they
held
their
own
and
finally
the
enemy
recoiled
they
were
helped
somewhat
in
their
inclination
to
retreat
by
a
charge
of
the
light
dragoons
upon
the
flank
of
their
regiment
the
which
had
about
men
sabred
thus
on
this
point
the
battle
was
saved
the
main
credit
must
go
to
mackenzie
s
brigade
which
has
never
received
the
praise
that
was
its
due
for
its
general
was
killed
and
thus
no
report
from
the
division
was
sent
in
to
wellesley
who
omitted
all
mention
of
its
doings
in
his
talavera
dispatch
it
is
never
too
late
to
do
homage
to
forgotten
valour
and
to
call
attention
to
a
neglected
feat
of
arms
the
services
of
the
and
saved
the
day
for
britain
lord
munster
general
desprez
relating
the
doings
of
sebastiani
s
division
says
that
the
were
cut
up
by
light
horse
but
there
were
no
cavalry
of
that
nation
in
this
part
of
the
field
and
it
would
seem
that
the
french
were
misled
by
the
blue
uniforms
of
the
light
dragoons
except
that
he
mentioned
the
colonels
of
the
and
among
the
officers
who
had
done
well
in
the
battle
the
only
place
where
a
good
account
of
the
doings
of
mackenzie
s
brigade
is
to
be
found
is
in
the
excellent
regimental
history
of
the
i
fully
share
the
indignation
expressed
by
its
author
at
the
unmerited
oblivion
in
which
its
splendid
doings
have
been
lying
for
so
many
years
see
paton
s
of
the
sebastiani
therefore
drew
back
terribly
mauled
his
division
had
lost
its
four
colonels
seven
of
its
twelve
seventy
other
officers
and
rank
and
file
including
some
sixty
prisoners
there
was
no
more
fight
left
in
them
they
recoiled
into
the
plain
and
drew
up
at
last
not
far
from
the
wrecks
of
leval
s
division
a
full
mile
beyond
the
portiña
meanwhile
however
great
may
have
been
the
danger
in
the
british
that
in
the
was
even
greater
cameron
s
low
s
and
langwerth
s
brigades
were
all
in
the
most
desperate
position
the
former
not
having
pushed
so
far
to
the
front
as
the
four
german
battalions
had
suffered
least
of
the
three
though
it
had
lost
men
out
of
but
the
legionary
troops
were
in
far
worse
case
langwerth
had
been
killed
and
his
brigade
was
reduced
from
to
bayonets
just
fifty
per
cent
of
the
men
had
been
lost
low
had
gone
into
action
with
only
rank
and
file
owing
to
the
heavy
of
the
preceding
night
of
these
he
now
lost
including
made
prisoners
in
the
disorderly
retreat
down
the
slope
of
the
cerro
de
cascajal
that
these
troops
ever
rallied
and
made
head
at
all
when
they
had
recrossed
the
portiña
is
much
to
their
credit
the
situation
was
saved
by
wellesley
s
own
prescience
the
moment
that
he
saw
the
rash
attack
on
the
french
line
to
which
sherbrooke
had
committed
himself
he
looked
round
for
supports
which
might
be
utilized
to
stay
the
inevitable
reaction
that
must
follow
mackenzie
s
brigade
was
available
on
the
and
was
used
as
we
have
seen
but
there
were
no
infantry
reserves
behind
the
it
was
necessary
to
send
down
troops
from
the
cerro
de
medellin
villatte
was
then
threatening
its
front
ruffin
was
marching
to
turn
its
northern
flank
and
wellesley
did
not
dare
to
detach
a
whole
brigade
from
the
key
of
the
position
he
took
however
richard
stewart
s
strongest
battalion
the
under
colonel
donnellan
which
had
still
over
bayonets
in
line
even
after
its
losses
in
the
morning
and
sent
it
at
full
speed
down
the
southern
slope
of
the
cerro
it
arrived
in
time
to
take
position
on
the
old
ground
of
the
british
line
at
the
moment
that
the
retreating
masses
came
rolling
back
across
the
portiña
if
the
had
been
carried
away
in
the
general
backward
movement
the
day
would
have
been
lost
but
the
regiment
stood
firm
and
allowed
cameron
s
and
langwerth
s
troops
to
pass
by
its
flanks
and
form
up
in
its
rear
while
it
was
holding
back
lapisse
s
central
advance
the
defeated
brigades
rallied
and
with
admirable
celerity
and
the
battle
was
restored
here
as
further
to
the
right
the
fighting
now
resolved
itself
into
a
furious
between
enemies
both
of
whom
were
now
spent
and
weakened
by
their
previous
exertions
in
such
a
duel
the
line
had
always
the
advantage
over
the
column
in
the
end
the
french
when
once
brought
to
a
standstill
by
the
lost
their
and
stood
heaped
together
in
disorderly
masses
keeping
up
a
rolling
fire
but
gaining
no
ground
howorth
turned
upon
them
the
batteries
on
the
cerro
de
medellin
which
enfiladed
their
flank
and
added
to
their
confusion
general
lapisse
himself
was
killed
at
this
moment
as
he
was
trying
to
urge
on
his
men
to
a
final
advance
it
was
probably
however
not
his
death
on
which
all
the
french
accounts
lay
great
stress
but
rather
the
defeat
of
sebastiani
s
division
on
their
immediate
right
which
finally
shook
the
of
the
french
regiments
and
induced
them
to
move
back
first
at
a
slow
pace
then
in
undisguised
retreat
the
shattered
remnants
of
the
german
legion
and
of
the
and
were
in
no
condition
to
follow
seldom
have
two
combatants
so
thoroughly
mauled
each
other
as
had
the
twelve
french
and
the
seven
allied
battalions
which
fought
in
this
part
of
the
field
of
the
men
of
lapisse
s
division
the
general
other
officers
and
men
were
de
of
british
and
german
troops
opposed
to
them
almost
exactly
the
same
number
had
been
lost
a
general
langwerth
officers
and
men
that
the
smaller
force
should
ever
have
held
its
ground
after
losing
more
than
a
third
of
its
number
is
almost
miraculous
there
was
no
such
a
victory
as
this
during
the
whole
war
save
albuera
in
most
modern
english
narratives
of
talavera
it
is
stated
that
the
supported
the
guards
this
must
be
a
mistake
caused
by
a
misreading
of
wellesley
s
dispatch
it
is
certain
that
the
guards
fell
back
on
mackenzie
s
brigade
contemporary
accounts
by
officers
of
the
speak
of
the
coldstreams
passing
through
them
to
the
scots
fusiliers
therefore
must
have
had
the
and
behind
them
donnellan
and
the
really
supported
langwerth
s
german
battalions
as
lord
londonderry
the
only
historian
who
has
got
the
facts
right
clearly
shows
it
is
curious
that
the
historians
of
the
battle
have
not
seen
that
the
germans
in
their
dreadfully
mauled
condition
could
not
have
been
rallied
without
external
aid
this
aid
was
given
by
donnellan
while
mackenzie
was
saving
the
guards
the
figures
are
after
deducting
the
losses
of
the
earlier
combats
low
s
brigade
langwerth
s
cameron
s
a
total
of
the
losses
were
low
langwerth
cameron
a
total
of
including
officers
see
tables
in
appendix
while
the
main
stress
of
the
battle
had
been
rolling
across
the
lower
slopes
above
the
middle
course
of
the
portiña
matters
had
been
comparatively
quiet
on
the
cerro
de
medellin
victor
it
will
be
remembered
had
ordered
that
villatte
was
to
make
no
serious
attack
on
the
height
until
the
divisions
to
his
left
had
made
some
impression
upon
the
british
centre
but
lapisse
and
sebastiani
in
spite
of
their
temporary
successes
had
never
broken
into
wellesley
s
position
the
assault
on
the
cerro
therefore
was
never
made
though
a
furious
artillery
fire
was
kept
up
against
its
garrison
throughout
the
afternoon
the
handful
of
british
guns
upon
the
crest
could
make
no
adequate
reply
hence
the
three
brigades
of
tilson
richard
stewart
and
donkin
were
suffering
very
serious
losses
from
the
long
cannonade
wellesley
had
made
them
shelter
themselves
as
far
as
was
possible
behind
the
nevertheless
the
storm
of
shot
and
shell
that
beat
upon
the
position
was
not
without
effect
in
donkin
s
brigade
no
one
save
the
light
companies
skirmishing
along
the
lower
slopes
discharged
a
musket
that
afternoon
yet
the
casualties
in
its
ranks
were
no
less
than
hill
s
two
brigades
though
better
covered
had
still
many
killed
and
wounded
that
the
of
the
british
artillery
and
skirmishers
was
not
altogether
ineffective
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
the
two
regiments
of
villatte
s
second
brigade
which
held
the
opposite
slope
lost
men
and
even
the
squadrons
of
beaumont
in
its
rear
had
a
few
troopers
disabled
nevertheless
the
fighting
in
this
part
of
the
field
was
not
only
indecisive
but
comparatively
innocuous
to
both
sides
when
compared
with
the
awful
slaughter
that
was
going
on
to
their
right
for
a
description
of
the
sufferings
of
the
whose
battalion
companies
did
not
fire
a
single
shot
during
the
cannonade
of
the
afternoon
see
grattan
s
vol
iii
for
these
losses
see
the
talavera
appendix
it
only
remains
to
tell
of
the
combat
to
the
north
of
the
cerro
in
the
narrow
valley
that
separated
the
british
position
from
the
sierra
de
segurilla
here
the
engagement
began
at
a
much
later
hour
than
in
the
centre
all
the
observers
on
the
hill
speak
of
the
first
contest
of
campbell
and
leval
as
being
concluded
and
of
that
of
sherbrooke
and
sebastiani
as
being
at
its
height
before
the
french
right
wing
began
to
move
the
french
troops
in
this
direction
it
will
be
remembered
were
the
three
regiments
of
ruffin
now
mere
wrecks
of
their
former
selves
and
the
first
brigade
of
villatte
s
division
that
of
cassagne
the
six
battalions
of
the
latter
force
were
near
the
cerro
de
medellin
while
ruffin
s
men
stood
further
to
the
north
under
the
sierra
de
segurilla
in
support
of
them
both
lay
merlin
s
division
of
light
cavalry
at
the
moment
when
victor
had
received
permission
to
turn
the
flank
of
the
cerro
it
had
appeared
that
he
would
meet
little
opposition
but
long
ere
the
french
were
ready
to
advance
they
had
seen
allied
troops
arriving
in
haste
and
taking
up
their
position
at
the
southern
end
of
the
valley
first
fane
s
and
anson
s
cavalry
had
drawn
up
on
the
level
ground
then
bassecourt
s
spanish
infantry
had
appeared
on
the
rocky
slopes
of
the
sierra
and
had
thrown
out
a
long
skirmishing
line
opposite
ruffin
s
right
lastly
albuquerque
s
whole
cavalry
division
had
ridden
round
from
the
rear
of
the
centre
and
taken
post
behind
anson
and
fane
there
were
now
over
bayonets
and
sabres
in
face
of
the
french
brigades
it
was
clear
that
any
attempt
to
storm
the
northern
face
of
the
cerro
would
expose
the
troops
that
attempted
it
to
a
flank
attack
from
the
allied
troops
in
the
valley
it
was
this
that
made
ruffin
and
villatte
who
was
present
in
person
with
cassagne
s
brigade
very
chary
of
molesting
hill
s
position
on
the
other
hand
if
the
french
advanced
up
the
valley
to
attack
the
cavalry
at
its
southern
end
they
would
expose
themselves
to
a
flanking
fire
from
the
guns
on
the
cerro
and
from
hill
s
infantry
brigade
nevertheless
when
the
roar
of
the
invisible
battle
on
the
other
side
of
the
cascajal
height
was
at
its
loudest
the
two
french
generals
began
a
cautious
advance
towards
the
front
they
at
once
came
under
a
tiresome
flanking
artillery
fire
from
the
cerro
half
rettberg
s
battery
of
the
german
legion
had
been
placed
on
a
spur
from
which
it
enfiladed
villatte
s
nearest
regiment
two
heavy
spanish
opened
from
another
part
of
the
slope
and
albuquerque
had
also
placed
his
guns
in
a
position
from
which
they
bore
up
the
valley
the
pieces
that
accompanied
the
french
advance
being
in
the
trough
of
the
depression
could
do
little
harm
in
return
hartmann
of
the
artillery
has
a
note
on
these
pieces
they
were
useful
because
of
their
heavy
calibre
none
of
the
british
guns
being
heavier
than
they
were
bright
new
brass
cannon
from
the
arsenal
at
seville
their
machinery
for
sighting
and
elevation
was
of
a
most
primitive
type
a
century
out
of
date
the
lieutenant
in
command
seemed
unable
to
hit
anything
with
them
whereupon
hartmann
got
off
his
horse
himself
laid
a
gun
and
had
the
luck
to
dismount
a
french
piece
in
the
valley
after
this
the
spaniards
fired
better
and
did
very
good
service
after
advancing
as
far
as
the
path
which
leads
from
talavera
to
segurilla
ruffin
deployed
his
right
regiment
the
much
depleted
léger
and
sent
it
up
the
sierra
to
form
a
screen
opposite
bassecourt
s
infantry
the
other
six
battalions
the
and
advanced
in
column
along
the
valley
with
the
from
cassagne
s
brigade
on
their
left
presently
the
whole
came
level
with
the
northern
slope
of
the
cerro
just
reaching
the
farm
of
valdefuentes
at
its
foot
at
this
moment
lapisse
s
attack
had
already
been
beaten
off
and
wellesley
was
able
to
turn
his
attention
from
the
centre
to
the
flank
of
his
line
crossing
the
crest
of
the
cerro
he
studied
for
a
moment
the
situation
of
the
french
regiments
and
then
sent
down
orders
for
anson
s
brigade
of
light
dragoons
to
charge
them
with
fane
s
heavy
cavalry
in
support
the
moment
that
the
british
horsemen
were
seen
to
be
advancing
the
enemy
hastily
formed
squares
the
and
slightly
to
the
west
of
the
segurilla
road
the
in
a
more
advanced
position
just
under
the
walls
of
the
farm
of
valdefuentes
a
battalion
of
and
the
of
the
line
which
formed
villatte
s
supports
also
fell
into
square
far
to
the
rear
the
concentration
of
the
french
regiments
in
vast
masses
of
three
battalions
each
gave
a
great
opportunity
to
the
allied
artillery
which
found
easy
targets
in
the
square
blocks
of
men
at
their
feet
that
the
charge
of
anson
s
light
dragoons
came
after
victory
had
been
secured
in
the
centre
is
clear
from
several
of
the
who
was
on
top
of
the
cerro
and
close
to
wellesley
writes
the
favourable
termination
of
the
battle
in
the
centre
created
great
excitement
the
cheer
which
had
been
from
the
height
had
hardly
died
away
when
a
scene
of
another
character
was
in
preparation
the
movements
of
the
divisions
ruffin
and
villatte
had
during
the
late
contest
been
vacillating
and
uncertain
formed
to
all
appearance
to
attack
the
height
they
had
even
advanced
some
distance
towards
its
base
sir
arthur
crossed
with
rapid
steps
from
the
right
of
the
to
the
part
of
the
hill
looking
down
on
anson
s
brigade
it
was
immediately
known
that
a
charge
would
take
place
as
anson
s
brigade
advanced
the
right
regiment
the
light
dragoons
found
itself
opposite
the
large
square
of
the
léger
while
the
light
dragoons
of
the
german
legion
faced
the
smaller
masses
of
the
and
the
ground
seemed
favourable
for
a
charge
and
though
an
attack
on
unbroken
infantry
is
always
hazardous
the
squadrons
came
on
with
great
confidence
and
were
soon
closing
in
at
headlong
speed
upon
the
hostile
line
an
unforeseen
chance
of
war
however
wrecked
the
whole
plan
the
long
dry
waving
grass
of
the
valley
seemed
to
show
a
level
surface
but
the
appearance
was
deceitful
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
in
front
of
the
french
squares
was
a
narrow
but
deep
ravine
the
bed
of
a
small
which
discharges
its
waters
into
the
portiña
during
the
rainy
season
it
was
about
fifteen
feet
broad
and
ten
feet
deep
in
the
northern
part
of
the
field
a
little
narrower
in
its
southern
course
there
were
many
places
at
which
it
could
be
crossed
with
ease
by
a
horseman
moving
alone
and
at
a
moderate
pace
but
for
squadrons
riding
knee
to
knee
at
headlong
speed
it
was
a
dangerous
obstacle
and
indeed
a
trap
of
the
most
deadly
sort
it
was
wholly
invisible
to
the
horsemen
till
they
came
upon
it
colonel
elley
the
second
in
command
of
the
who
rode
two
lengths
ahead
of
the
front
line
of
his
regiment
mounted
on
a
grey
horse
and
conspicuous
to
every
observer
on
the
cerro
de
medellin
was
the
first
man
to
discover
the
peril
his
charger
cleared
it
at
a
bound
but
knowing
that
the
inferior
mounts
of
the
rank
and
file
would
certainly
come
to
grief
he
wheeled
round
on
the
further
bank
threw
up
his
hand
and
tried
to
wave
back
his
followers
it
was
too
late
the
two
squadrons
of
the
front
line
were
on
the
brink
of
the
ravine
before
they
could
understand
his
action
some
of
the
troopers
cleared
the
obstacle
in
their
stride
some
swerved
in
time
and
refused
to
take
the
leap
others
scrambled
into
and
over
the
less
difficult
points
of
the
ditch
but
many
fell
horse
and
man
into
the
trap
and
were
then
crushed
by
the
rear
rank
falling
in
on
top
of
them
there
were
several
broken
necks
and
scores
of
broken
arms
and
legs
in
the
leading
squadrons
the
second
line
got
warning
of
the
obstacle
by
seeing
the
inexplicable
disorder
into
which
their
fellows
had
fallen
they
slackened
their
pace
but
were
borne
into
the
confused
mass
at
the
ravine
before
they
could
entirely
bring
themselves
to
a
stand
meanwhile
the
front
face
of
the
square
formed
by
the
léger
opened
fire
on
the
unhappy
regiment
the
german
light
dragoons
on
the
northern
side
of
the
valley
came
upon
the
fatal
cutting
at
a
point
where
it
was
somewhat
shallower
and
broader
than
in
front
of
the
one
of
their
officers
estimates
it
in
his
narrative
at
eighteen

in
width
and
six
or
eight
in
depth
their
disaster
therefore
was
not
so
complete
as
that
of
their
british
comrades
but
many
troopers
of
the
first
line
were
unhorsed
and
others
though
keeping
their
saddles
could
not
manage
to
scramble
up
the
further
side
of
the
ravine
the
rear
squadrons
came
up
in
time
to
add
to
the
confusion
and
reined
up
among
the
survivors
of
the
front
napier
ii
has
a
story
that
arentschildt
of
the
german
dragoons
discovered
the
ravine
in
time
and
checked
his
line
crying
i
will
not
kill
my
young
mans
thereby
saving
his
regiment
and
taking
no
part
in
the
charge
this
is
entirely
disproved
by
the
narratives
of
the
officers
of
the
dragoons
quoted
in
beamish
s
of
the
king
s
german
the
evidence
of
colonel
von
der
decken
alone
suffices
to
show
that
the
regiment
fell
into
the
trap
suffered
severe
losses
therein
and
then
executed
a
disorderly
and
ineffective
charge
on
ruffin
s
squares
after
which
it
returned
to
its
old
position
with
a
loss
of
nearly
forty
men
napier
seems
to
have
been
misled
by
the
statement
of
major
ponsonby
of
the
to
the
effect
that
the
germans
turned
back
at
the
ravine
he
also
says
that
seymour
colonel
of
the
was
wounded
but
that
officer
s
name
does
not
appear
in
the
casualty
list
the
two
regiments
were
now
in
utter
confusion
and
had
already
suffered
severe
loss
both
by
the
fall
into
the
ravine
and
by
the
french
musketry
which
had
opened
upon
them
their
colonels
would
have
been
wise
to
give
up
the
attempt
to
advance
and
to
fall
back
in
their
old
position
how
could
squadrons
in
such
a
disordered
state
hope
to
break
into
french
squares
but
both
seymour
of
the
and
arentschildt
were
officers
of
high
mettle
and
throwing
prudence
to
the
winds
they
collected
such
of
their
men
as
had
leaped
or
scrambled
over
the
ravine
and
led
them
against
the
hostile
infantry
probably
little
more
than
half
of
either
corps
took
part
in
the
final
charge
be
this
as
it
may
both
the
and
the
legionary
dragoons
made
an
attempt
to
gallop
in
upon
the
squares
in
their
front
the
germans
rode
at
that
of
the
regiment
received
its
fire
and
were
repulsed
though
a
few
men
fell
close
in
upon
the
bayonets
they
then
galloped
off
and
fell
back
up
the
valley
far
more
disastrous
was
the
fate
of
the
english
regiment
the
survivors
of
the
two
left
squadrons
charged
the
square
of
the
léger
were
repulsed
with
heavy
loss
recrossed
the
ravine
and
struggled
back
to
the
british
lines
but
colonel
elley
and
the
right
squadrons
having
no
enemy
immediately
in
their
front
rode
furiously
between
the
french
square
and
the
farm
of
valdefuentes
and
charged
a
line
of
cavalry
which
was
visible
a
few
hundred
yards
to
the
rear
this
was
the
leading
brigade
and
chasseurs
of
merlin
s
division
which
was
acting
in
support
of
villatte
and
ruffin
the
squadrons
in
front
of
the
swerved
to
the
side
when
charged
but
on
passing
them
the
british
dragoons
found
another
regiment
of
merlin
s
second
line
opposed
to
them
they
dashed
at
it
whereupon
the
regiment
that
had
evaded
them
swung
round
and
fell
upon
their
rear
encircled
by
fivefold
numbers
the
remnant
of
drake
s
and
allen
s
squadrons
of
the
were
annihilated
only
a
few
officers
including
their
leader
elley
and
two
or
three
troopers
cut
their
way
through
the
enemy
rode
off
to
the
northward
and
ultimately
escaped
to
bassecourt
s
spanish
line
on
the
sierra
de
segurilla
the
total
loss
of
the
regiment
was
killed
wounded
and
missing
out
of
sabres
who
took
the
field
in
the
morning
of
these
three
officers
and
men
were
prisoners
most
of
them
wounded
in
this
charge
they
carried
away
with
them
and
almost
captured
generals
villatte
and
cassagne
who
had
failed
to
take
refuge
in
the
square
of
the
and
were
caught
outside
it
sémélé
s
report
in
the
french
official
reports
it
is
said
that
general
strolz
the
brigadier
drew
aside
the
chasseurs
in
order
to
fall
upon
the
british
dragoons
from
the
flank
rocca
says
that
the
regiment
was
charged
and
broke
but
rallied
again

le

il
chargea

en
as
the
regiment
only
lost
five
killed
it
does
not
seem
likely
that
it
was
broken
the
french
records
do
not
give
the
number
of
its
wounded
this
was
the
westphalian
regiment
among
the
other
officers
who
cut
their
way
through
was
lord
george
william

desperately
wounded
by
a
cut
on
the
shoulder
only
three
officers
two
wounded
were
taken
prisoners
from
these
two
squadrons
two
others
were
killed
it
would
seem
therefore
that
out
of
twelve
present
with
the
two
right
squadrons
several
succeeded
in
getting
out
of
the
trap
elley
says
that
the
whole
body
that
followed
him
did
not
exceed
sabres
and
that
seven
or
eight
only
cut
their
way
through
the
enemy
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
the
survivors
of
the
found
their
way
back
to
the
western
end
of
the
valley
and
the
battle
in
the
centre
had
long
died
down
to
a
cannonade
ruffin
and
villatte
now
had
it
in
their
power
to
advance
again
but
did
not
do
so
if
they
had
gone
further
forward
they
would
have
lent
their
flank
still
more
to
hill
s
troops
upon
the
cerro
and
would
have
had
to
deploy
a
movement
which
would
have
exposed
them
when
no
longer
protected
by
formation
in
square
to
charges
from
the
mass
of
allied
cavalry
still
visible
in
their
front
fane
s
brigade
and
albuquerque
s
strong
division
bassecourt
s
spaniards
were
holding
their
ground
against
the
which
had
been
sent
up
on
to
the
sierra
de
segurilla
and
to
drive
them
back
ruffin
would
have
had
to
detach
more
battalions
from
his
main
column
news
had
been
received
that
the
central
attack
had
completely
failed
it
was
natural
therefore
that
after
some
hesitation
the
french
right
wing
retired
and
fell
back
up
the
valley
of
the
portiña
villatte
s
two
regiments
had
lost
about
men
while
standing
in
square
under
the
fire
of
the
guns
on
the
cerro
they
could
no
longer
be
regarded
as
fresh
troops
fit
for
a
prolonged
advance
while
the
wrecks
of
ruffin
s
battalions
having
now
been
under
fire
three
separate
times
in
eighteen
hours
were
utterly
exhausted
it
is
clear
that
victor
could
not
have
dared
to
risk
a
serious
attack
upon
the
british
left
with
these
forces
illustration
battle
of
talavera
the
main
engagement
to
july
the
battle
had
now
come
to
a
standstill
of
the
five
french
infantry
divisions
in
the
front
line
those
of
leval
sebastiani
and
lapisse
were
reforming
their
diminished
ranks
in
the
plain
far
to
the
east
of
the
portiña
while
villatte
and
ruffin
had
fallen
back
on
to
the
slopes
of
the
cerro
de
cascajal
the
only
intact
infantry
still
remaining
at
the
disposition
of
the
king
were
his
own
guards
and
the
bayonets
of
dessolles
with
these
and
with
villatte
s
two
brigades
which
had
only
lost
men
it
would
have
been
possible
to
prepare
one
more
assault
upon
the
british
position
victor
raging
with
anger
at
his
third
repulse
was
anxious
to
continue
the
action
though
he
had
lost
nearly
one
man
in
four
of
his
infantry
and
had
not
won
an
inch
of
ground
the
king
was
less
hopeful
the
frightful
slaughter
had
subdued
his
spirits
and
he
asked
himself
whether
the
men
of
his
reserve
would
suffice
to
break
the
thin
red
line
against
which
the
whole
of
the
and
corps
had
hurled
themselves
in
vain
for
a
moment
he
seemed
inclined
to
risk
his
last
stake
and
the
guards
and
dessolles
were
ordered
to
move
forward
but
they
had
not
gone
far
when
a
was
sent
to
check
them
milhaud
whose
dragoons
had
spent
the
whole
day
in
observing
the
spanish
lines
had
sent
in
a
message
to
the
effect
that
cuesta
was
at
last
showing
signs
of
life
and
that
he
could
see
numerous
troops
pushing
to
the
front
among
the
olive
groves
in
front
of
the
town
the
news
was
not
true
for
nothing
more
than
vedettes
and
small
exploring
parties
had
been
sent
out
by
the
spanish
general
but
the
very
suspicion
that
the
army
of
estremadura
might
at
last
be
preparing
to
take
the
initiative
was
enough
to
damp
the
very
moderate
ardour
of
king
joseph
if
he
committed
himself
to
one
final
dash
at
the
english
and
engaged
both
his
reserve
and
the
rallied
divisions
of
his
front
line
in
an
attack
upon
their
allied
centre
and
left
what
could
he
do
in
the
event
of
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
whole
spanish
army
in
the
act
of
turning
his
southern
flank
thousand
men
or
more
might
suddenly
sally
out
from
the
screen
of
groves
and
fling
themselves
upon
the
left
flank
of
sebastiani
s
corps
to
hold
them
back
nothing
would
be
available
but
the
sabres
of
milhaud
and
of
infantry
not
one
man
would
be
left
to
parry
such
a
stroke
the
king
could
not
flatter
himself
that
anything
but
a
disaster
could
ensue
even
if
it
were
not
true
that
the
spaniards
were
already
in
motion
there
was
every
reason
to
believe
that
they
might
deliver
an
attack
when
they
saw
the
last
french
reserves
put
into
action
against
the
british
few
generals
would
have
resisted
such
a
tempting
opportunity
it
was
to
be
remembered
also
that
some
of
the
spaniards
had
actually
come
out
of
their
lines
and
fallen
upon
leval
s
flank
when
the
last
assault
had
been
pressed
against
the
pajar
de
vergara
a
third
advance
in
this
quarter
might
yet
rouse
the
whole
estremaduran
army
out
of
its
apathy
and
induce
it
to
charge
home
upon
sebastiani
s
left
wing
jourdan
and
most
of
the
members
of
joseph
s
staff
were
convinced
that
it
would
be
mad
to
deliver
a
last
attack
on
the
british
line
in
face
of
the
possible
consequences
of
an
advance
by
the
spaniards
the
marshal
declared
that
it
was
impossible
to
proceed
with
any
further
scheme
of
advance
and
that
the
only
safe
course
was
to
draw
back
the
whole
army
towards
the
alberche
his
master
was
relieved
to
find
a
good
reason
for
ending
a
battle
which
had
been
begun
without
his
permission
and
continued
under
his
very
reluctant
sanction
orders
were
sent
along
the
whole
line
directing
both
the
and
the
corps
to
abandon
their
and
fall
back
to
their
old
position
of
the
the
cavalry
divisions
of
merlin
and
milhaud
were
to
cover
the
retreat
the
best
account
of
all
this
comes
from
the
of
general
desprez
who
was
riding
with
the
staff
at
this
moment
victor
was
furious
at
receiving
these
directions
he
averred
to
the
officer
who
bore
the
king
s
dispatch
that
from
his
point
of
vantage
on
the
cascajal
he
could
command
a
view
of
the
whole
spanish
army
and
that
he
was
positive
that
not
a
spaniard
had
moved
he
even
pretended
to
observe
signs
of
a
retreat
in
wellesley
s
lines
and
persisted
that
the
mere
demonstration
of
a
fourth
attack
would
induce
the
allies
to
abandon
their
position
how
he
came
to
form
any
such
conclusion
it
is
hard
to
see
for
the
whole
british
army
was
still
preserving
its
old
ground
and
no
one
from
the
down
to
the
youngest
private
was
dreaming
of
a
movement
to
the
rear
it
would
indeed
have
been
insane
to
desert
a
strong
position
in
order
to
retreat
across
the
open
in
face
of
an
army
possessing
excellent
cavalry
but
victor
still
loth
to
withdraw
and
to
own
himself
beaten
sent
word
to
the
king
that
he
took
it
upon
himself
to
remain
on
the
slopes
of
the
cascajal
till
he
should
receive
further
orders
and
that
he
yet
hoped
that
the
reserve
might
be
sent
forward
and
the
battle
renewed
when
victor
s
message
reached
the
king
it
had
already
been
discovered
that
all
the
rumours
concerning
the
advance
of
the
spaniards
were
false
but
the
hour
was
now
late
and
as
jourdan
observed
if
the
army
were
to
gain
a
final
success
a
most
problematical
occurrence
there
would
be
no
daylight
left
in
which
to
push
it
to
its
legitimate
end
he
thought
it
better
to
take
the
prudent
course
to
refuse
to
risk
the
reserve
whose
defeat
would
have
the
most
fatal
consequences
and
to
prepare
for
a
retreat
the
orders
were
accordingly
issued
that
the
army
should
fall
back
to
its
old
of
the
morning
deferring
the
passage
of
the
alberche
till
the
next
day
all
this
is
again
derived
from
desprez
who
both
carried
the
king
s
orders
to
victor
and
bore
back
victor
s
remonstrances
to
the
king
while
the
french
commanders
were
in
controversy
concerning
their
movements
the
battle
had
died
down
into
a
cannonade
kept
up
with
great
vehemence
by
the
batteries
on
the
cerro
de
cascajal
the
british
and
german
guns
never
ceased
their
reply
but
as
had
been
the
case
during
the
whole
day
they
were
far
too
few
to
subdue
the
enemy
s
fire
considering
how
they
were
overmatched
it
is
wonderful
that
there
was
but
one
piece
disabled
and
that
only
gunners
were
put
de
the
opposing
batteries
were
hit
almost
as
hard
for
the
artillery
of
the
corps
had
casualties
a
distressing
accident
took
place
during
this
final
strife
between
the
hostile
batteries
a
large
area
of
dry
grass
on
the
lower
slopes
of
the
cerro
de
medellin
took
fire
from
smouldering
wadding
fanned
by
the
wind
many
of
the
severely
wounded
of
both
sides
were
scorched
and
some
burnt
to
death
by
the
short
but
devouring
conflagration
that
ran
along
the
hillside
lord
munster
by
dusk
the
whole
of
the
corps
was
rolling
to
the
rear
and
the
last
rays
of
daylight
showed
wellesley
the
welcome
view
of
a
general
retreat
opposite
his
right
and
centre
victor
clung
obstinately
to
the
cerro
de
cascajal
till
far
into
the
hours
of
darkness
but
at
last
the
cold
fit
supervened
his
spirits
sank
and
he
withdrew
at
full
of
resentment
and
well
stocked
with
grievances
for
the
acrimonious
correspondence
with
joseph
and
jourdan
in
which
he
indulged
for
the
next
six
weeks
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
jourdan
was
right
in
refusing
to
fall
in
with
the
younger
marshal
s
plans
for
a
fourth
assault
on
the
british
wellesley
was
well
settled
into
his
at
the
southern
end
of
his
line
campbell
was
perfectly
safe
at
the
pajar
de
vergara
redoubt
he
had
lost
no
more
than
men
so
that
his
whole
division
was
practically
intact
hill
s
brigades
on
the
cerro
were
also
in
perfectly
good
order
they
had
not
been
attacked
since
the
morning
and
would
have
been
quite
competent
to
defend
themselves
at
five
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
the
cannonade
which
they
had
been
enduring
had
done
some
harm
but
there
were
still
men
in
line
to
hold
a
most
formidable
position
the
only
point
of
the
british
front
on
which
the
french
could
have
hoped
to
make
any
impression
was
the
centre
here
the
guards
and
cameron
s
brigade
had
suffered
heavily
and
the
four
battalions
of
the
german
legion
even
worse
they
had
lost
a
full
fifty
per
cent
of
their
numbers
but
mackenzie
s
division
was
now
in
line
with
sherbrooke
s
its
first
brigade
supporting
the
guards
its
second
donkin
s
linked
to
the
germans
considering
the
way
in
which
the
british
centre
had
dealt
with
the
bayonets
of
sebastiani
and
lapisse
during
the
main
engagement
the
french
critics
who
hold
that
they
would
have
given
way
before
the
men
of
dessolles
and
the
royal
guard
even
when
backed
by
the
rallied
divisions
show
a
very
optimistic
spirit
moreover
when
the
battle
had
waxed
hot
in
this
quarter
the
french
would
have
had
no
certainty
that
campbell
and
the
spaniards
might
not
have
fallen
upon
their
flank
for
leval
s
much
depleted
division
was
no
longer
in
front
of
the
british
right
it
had
been
withdrawn
behind
sebastiani
and
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
the
of
the
division
from
going
to
the
aid
of
sherbrooke
s
men
the
chances
of
war
are
incalculable
but
there
seems
no
reason
to
believe
that
victor
s
judgement
as
to
the
probability
of
success
was
any
better
at
five
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
than
it
had
been
at
five
o
clock
in
the
morning
jourdan
was
the
wiser
man
see
jourdan
s
thus
ended
the
battle
of
talavera
in
which
british
supported
and
repulsed
the
attack
of
french
infantry
omitting
from
the
total
of
the
assailants
the
division
of
villatte
which
was
only
slightly
engaged
the
cerro
de
medellin
was
strong
ground
but
not
so
strong
as
to
counterbalance
a
superiority
of
men
the
real
fighting
power
of
wellesley
s
was
shown
in
the
lower
parts
of
the
field
where
sherbrooke
s
and
mackenzie
s
bayonets
achieved
their
marvellous
success
over
the
men
of
lapisse
and
sebastiani
doomed
to
apparent
ruin
by
their
own
rash
valour
in
pursuing
the
enemy
across
the
portiña
they
yet
recovered
their
line
the
battle
and
finally
won
an
almost
incredible
victory
the
first
division
of
the
peninsular
army
the
guards
and
the
german
legion
who
fought
side
by
side
throughout
the
whole
war
had
many
proud
days
between
and
but
surely
talavera
was
the
most
honourable
of
them
all
yet
probably
mackenzie
s
brigade
and
donnellan
s
must
claim
an
even
higher
merit
it
was
their
prompt
and
steady
help
which
gave
their
comrades
time
to
and
warded
off
the
possibility
of
disaster
at
the
critical
moment
the
spaniards
had
little
to
do
upon
july
but
what
little
they
had
to
do
was
well
done
the
charge
of
the
cavalry
regiment
rey
was
well
timed
and
gallantly
delivered
the
few
battalions
engaged
near
the
pajar
de
vergara
and
in
bassecourt
s
division
behaved
steadily
the
artillery
sent
to
aid
the
british
was
manfully
worked
and
did
good
service
but
if
only
the
spanish
army
had
been
able
to
manœuvre
what
a
difference
there
must
have
been
in
the
battle
when
leval
sebastiani
and
lapisse
fell
back
in
disorder
at
what
would
have
been
the
fate
of
the
french
if
cuesta
could
have
led
out
men
upon
their
flank
and
rear
he
did
not
attempt
to
do
so
and
probably
he
was
right
yet
it
was
hard
for
a
british
army
to
have
to
fight
in
line
with
allies
who
were
perfectly
useless
for
any
large
offensive
movement
the
losses
of
talavera
as
we
have
already
shown
were
tremendous
on
both
sides
adding
together
the
casualties
of
the
and
the
the
british
lost
men
killed
wounded
and
missing
of
the
belonged
to
the
unfortunate
dragoons
and
nearly
to
the
german
legion
two
generals
mackenzie
and
langwerth
had
been
killed
and
three
colonels
ross
of
the
coldstream
guards
donnellan
of
the
and
gordon
of
the
the
french
losses
were
decidedly
heavier
though
the
percentage
in
the
regiments
was
in
most
cases
far
lower
than
that
in
the
victorious
british
force
the
total
was
of
whom
were
killed
wounded
and
missing
general
lapisse
and
von
porbeck
of
the
baden
regiment
one
of
leval
s
brigadiers
were
the
only
officers
of
distinction
slain
but
the
number
of
wounded
was
enormous
in
sebastiani
s
division
the
colonels
and
seven
out
of
twelve
of
the
battalion
commanders
were
disabled
cuesta
never
issued
any
proper
return
of
his
casualties
he
stated
in
one
of
his
dispatches
that
they
amounted
to
men
this
figure
can
not
possibly
represent
killed
and
wounded
alone
only
one
cavalry
regiment
five
or
six
battalions
and
three
batteries
were
engaged
none
of
them
heavily
the
british
troops
which
fought
in
their
neighbourhood
had
very
modest
losses
which
made
it
incredible
that
the
comrades
in
line
with
them
should
have
suffered
to
the
extent
of
more
than
or
men
the
balance
must
represent
the
missing
from
the
stampede
of
portago
s
division
upon
the
night
of
the
manglano
who
commanded
one
of
the
divisions
near
the
pajar
de
vergara
and
de
lastra
the
gallant
colonel
of
the
del
were
wounded
the
only
trophies
taken
on
either
side
were
the
seventeen
guns
of
leval
s
division
captured
by
campbell
and
the
spanish
cavalry
these
missing
do
not
include
the
french
wounded
taken
on
the
field
and
recovered
when
victor
came
back
to
talavera
on
and
captured
the
british
hospitals
the
french
return
was
drawn
up
only
after
when
these
men
had
been
released
i
have
used
of

mainly

admirable
accuracy
notes
on
the
topography
of

i
looked
over
the
proofs
of
the
last
three
chapters
seated
on
the
small
square
stone
that
marks
the
highest
point
of
the
cerro
de
medellin
after
having
carefully
walked
over
the
whole
field
from
end
to
end
on
april
the
ground
is
little
changed
in
aspect
but
the
lower
slopes
of
the
cerro
and
the
whole
of
its
opposite
neighbour
the
cascajal
hill
are
now
under
cultivation
the
former
was
covered
with
barley
nine
inches
high
and
the
rough
vegetation
of
thyme
and
dry
grass
which
the
narratives
of
describe
was
only
to
be
seen
upon
the
higher
and
steeper
parts
of
the
hill
and
on
the
sides
of
the
ravine
below
the
latter
is
steep
but
neither
very
broad
nor
particularly
difficult
to
negotiate
even
in
april
the
portiña
had
shrunk
to
a
chain
of
pools
of
uninviting
black
water
the
ditch
fatal
to
the
light
dragoons
in
the
northern
valley
is
still
visible
in
its
upper
part
where
the
german
regiment
met
it
the
obstacle
is
practically
unchanged
but
nearer
to
the
farm
of
valdefuentes
it
has
almost
disappeared
owing
to
the
extension
of
cultivation
there
is
only
a
drop
from
a
field
into
a
piece
of
rough
ground
full
of
reeds
and
where
the
soil
is
a
little
marshy
in
april
i
presume
that
when
the
field
was
made
the
hollow
was
partly
filled
up
and
the
watercourse
instead
of
flowing
in
a
narrow
ditch
has
diffused
itself
over
the
whole
trough
of
the
ground
in
the
central
parts
of
the
field
the
portiña
forms
a
boundary
but
not
an
obstacle
where
cameron
and
the
guards
fought
sebastiani
s
men
the
ground
is
almost
an
exact
level
on
both
sides
of
the
little
stream
there
is
no
position
whatever
on
the
english
bank
which
is
if
anything
a
little
lower
than
the
french
the
pajar
de
vergara
is
a
low
knoll
twenty
feet
high
now
crowned
by
a
large
farmhouse
which
occupies
the
site
of
the
old
battery
the
ground
in
front
of
it
is
still
covered
with
olive
groves
and
troops
placed
here
could
see
nothing
of
an
advancing
enemy
till
he
emerges
from
the
trees
a
hundred
yards
or
so
to
the
front
on
the
other
hand
an
observer
on
the
summit
of
the
cerro
de
medellin
gets
a
perfect
bird
view
of
this
part
of
the
ground
and
could
make
out
the
enemy
all
through
his
progress
among
the
olives
wellesley
must
have
been
able
to
mark
exactly
every
movement
of
leval
s
division
though
campbell
could
certainly
not
have
done
so
in
the
spanish
part
of
the
line
the
groves
have
evidently
been
thinned
as
there
are
now
many
houses
forming
a
straggling
suburb
pushed
up
to
and
along
the
railway
which
now
crosses
this
section
of
the
line
in
talavera

still
within
its
walls
which
it
has
now
overstepped
the
cascajal
is
practically
of
the
same
height
as
the
main
eastern
level
of
the
cerro
de
medellin
but
the
triple
summit
of
the
latter
is
much
loftier
ground
and
standing
on
it
one
commands
the
whole
of
the
cascajal
every
one
of
villatte
s
battalions
must
have
been
counted
by
wellesley
who
could
also
mark
every
man
along
the
whole
french
front
even
into
and
among
the
olive
groves
occupied
by
leval
s
germans
victor
on
the
cascajal
could
get
no
such
a
general
view
of
the
british
position
but
could
see
very
well
into
sherbrooke
s
line
hill
s
troops
behind
the
first
crest
of
the
cerro

and
campbell
s

have
been
much
less
visible
to
him
there
is
a
ruined

apparently
a
mill
in
the
ravine
between
the
two
cerros
as
it
is
not
mentioned
in
any

of

i
conclude
that
it

not
in

also
modern
and
the
only
building
on
the

the
retreat
from
talavera
when
the
dawn
of
july
had
arrived
the
plain
and
the
rolling
hills
in
front
of
the
allied
position
were
seen
to
be
absolutely
deserted
no
trace
of
the
french
army
was
visible
save
the
heaps
of
dead
upon
the
further
side
of
the
portiña
the
wounded
had
been
carried
off
with
the
exception
of
those
who
had
fallen
within
the
british
lines
and
so
become
prisoners
of
war
it
was
soon
discovered
that
the
enemy
had
left
a
screen
of
cavalry
along
the
western
bank
of
the
alberche
but
whether
his
main
body
lay
close
behind
the
stream
or
had
retired
towards
madrid
could
not
be
ascertained
without
making
a
reconnaissance
in
force
such
an
operation
was
beyond
wellesley
s
power
on
the
morning
after
the
battle
he
was
neither
able
nor
willing
to
send
out
a
large
detachment
to
beat
up
the
enemy
s
camps
with
the
object
of
ascertaining
his
situation
and
intentions
the
british
army
was
utterly
exhausted
on
the
preceding
day
the
men
had
fought
upon
when
the
contest
was
over
they
had
found
that
only
a
third
of
a
ration
had
been
issued
this
scanty
pittance
was
sent
up
to
the
regiments
in
the
evening
as
they
still
lay
in
on
the
ground
that
they
had
held
during
the
day
water
was
almost
equally
deficient
it
was
difficult
to
procure
nothing
but
the
wells
of
the
few
houses
in
the
rear
of
the
position
being
available
only
on
the
morning
of
the
when
the
departure
of
the
enemy
had
become
certain
were
the
troops
allowed
to
return
to
their
old
bivouacs
in
the
rear
and
there
to
seek
repose
even
then
it
was
only
a
minority
of
the
men
who
could
be
spared
from
duty
the
gathering
in
of
the
vast
numbers
wounded
french
as
well
as
english
and
their
removal
into
talavera
demanded
such
enormous
that
the
larger
number
of
the
survivors
had
to
be
told
off
to
this
work
and
were
denied
the
rest
that
they
had
so
well
earned
it
is
certain
that
the
british
army
could
have
done
nothing
upon
the
even
if
their
commander
had
desired
to
push
forward
against
the
enemy
the
men
were
not
only
tired
out
by
two
days
of
battle
but
in
addition
but
wellesley
was
far
from
feeling
any
wish
to
pursue
the
french
his
infantry
had
suffered
so
dreadfully
that
he
could
not
dream
of
exposing
them
to
the
ordeal
of
another
engagement
till
they
had
been
granted
a
respite
for
the
refreshment
of
body
and
spirit
of
his
divisions
only
that
of
campbell
the
smallest
of
the
four
was
practically
intact
the
others
had
suffered
paralysing
losses
in
hill
s
ranks
one
man
out
of
every
four
had
been
stricken
down
in
mackenzie
s
one
man
in
every
three
while
sherbrooke
s
frightful
showed
that
nearly
two
men
out
of
five
were
missing
from
the
ranks
never
save
at
albuera
was
such
slaughter
on
the
side
of
the
victors
seen
again
during
the
whole
course
of
the
peninsular
war
the
extreme
fatigue
of
the
troops
wrote
wellesley
the
want
of
provisions
and
the
number
of
wounded
to
be
taken
care
of
have
prevented
me
from
moving
from
my
position
wellesley
to
castlereagh
iv
on
the
morning
of
the
the
depleted
strength
of
the
army
was
partly
compensated
by
the
arrival
of
the
first
of
those
reinforcements
from
lisbon
which
wellesley
had
been
anxiously
expecting
at
about
six
o
clock
robert
craufurd
came
upon
the
scene
with
the
three
regiments
of
his
light
brigade
all
old
battalions
who
had
shared
in
moore
s
corunna
campaign
he
was
accompanied
by
a
battery
of
horse
artillery
a
troop
the
first
unit
of
that
arm
which
came
under
wellesley
s
command
but
the
light
brigade
were
almost
as
weary
as
their
comrades
who
had
fought
in
the
battle
they
had
only
reached
talavera
by
a
forced
march
of
unexampled
severity
hearing
at
navalmoral
that
the
two
armies
were
in
presence
robert
craufurd
had
hurried
forward
with
almost
incredible
swiftness
dropping
his
baggage
and
a
few
weakly
men
at
oropesa
he
had
marched
miles
in
hours
though
the
day
was
hot
and
every
soldier
carried
some
fifty
pounds
weight
upon
his
back
all
day
long
the
cannon
was
heard
growling
in
the
distance
and
at
short
intervals
the
brigade
kept
meeting
parties
of
spanish
fugitives
interspersed
with
british
sutlers
and
commissaries
who
gave
the
most
dismal
accounts
of
the
progress
of
the
fight
in
spite
of
his
desperate
efforts
to
get
up
in
time
craufurd
reached
the
field
thirteen
hours
too
late
and
heard
to
his
intense
chagrin
that
the
battle
had
been
won
without
his
aid
weary
though
his
men
were
they
were
at
once
hurried
to
the
front
to
relieve
campbell
s
division
on
the
line
of
advanced
posts
there
they
found
plenty
of
employment
in
burying
the
dead
and
in
gathering
up
the
french
wounded
whom
it
was
necessary
to
protect
from
the
fury
of
the
spanish
peasantry
for
excellent
accounts
of
this
forced
march

of
the
life
of

the
distance
was
miles
not
as
napier
states
that
all
the
stragglers
met
on
the
way
were
not
spaniards
is
unfortunately
evident
from
both
narratives
nor
were
all
the
british
stragglers
the
arrival
of
craufurd
s
brigade
did
something
towards
filling
up
the
terrible
gap
in
the
ranks
of
the
british
infantry
but
was
far
from
enabling
wellesley
to
assume
the
offensive
indeed
the
advent
of
fresh
troops
only
accentuated
the
difficulty
of
feeding
the
army
corn
was
still
almost
unobtainable
the
supplies
from
the
vera
de
plasencia
showed
no
signs
of
appearing
and
even
oxen
for
the
which
had
hitherto
been
obtainable
in
fair
quantities
were
beginning
to
run
short
nothing
was
to
be
had
from
talavera
itself
where
victor
had
exhausted
all
the
available
food
many
weeks
before
nor
could
any
assistance
be
got
from
the
spanish
army
who
were
themselves
commencing
to
feel
the
pinch
of
starvation
all
wellesley
s
hopes
at
this
juncture
were
founded
on
the
idea
that
the
diversion
of
venegas
upon
the
upper
tagus
would
force
the
french
host
in
his
front
to
break
up
in
order
to
save
madrid
from
an
attack
in
the
rear
the
army
of
la
mancha
had
failed
to
keep
sebastiani
in
check
and
to
prevent
him
from
appearing
on
the
field
of
talavera
but
since
the
enemy
had
concentrated
every
available
man
for
the
battle
it
was
certain
that
venegas
had
now
no
hostile
force
in
his
front
and
that
the
way
to
the
capital
was
open
to
him
if
he
had
pushed
on
either
by
aranjuez
or
by
toledo
he
must
now
be
close
to
the
capital
and
king
joseph
would
be
obliged
to
detach
a
large
force
against
him
that
detachment
once
made
the
army
behind
the
alberche
would
be
so
much
weakened
that
it
would
be
unable
to
face
the
british
and
cuesta
if
it
offered
fight
it
must
be
beaten
if
it
retired
the
allies
would
follow
it
up
and
drive
it
away
in
a
direction
which
would
prevent
it
from
rejoining
the
troops
that
had
been
sent
against
venegas
on
the
wellesley
was
under
the
impression
that
the
army
of
la
mancha
had
already
brought
pressure
to
bear
upon
the
french
for
a
false
report
had
reached
him
that
on
the
previous
day
it
had
captured
toledo
his
dispatches
written
after
the
arrival
of
this
rumour
indicate
an
intention
of
moving
forward
on
the
thirtieth
or
the
king
he
says
must
now
detach
troops
against
venegas
this
being
so
it
will
be
necessary
to
induce
cuesta
to
advance
supporting
him
with
the
british
army
as
soon
as
it
shall
be
a
little
rested
and
refreshed
after
two
days
of
the
hardest
fighting
that
i
have
ever
been
a
party
to
we
shall
certainly
move
towards
madrid
if
not
interrupted
by
some
accident
on
our
flank
wellington
to
beresford
talavera
july
the
last
words
of
this
sentence
are
of
great
importance
since
they
show
that
already
upon
the
day
after
talavera
wellesley
was
beginning
to
be
uneasy
about
his
left
flank
some
time
before
the
battle
he
had
received
news
from
the
north
to
the
effect
that
both
ney
and
kellermann
had
returned
to
the
valley
of
the
douro
after
evacuating
galicia
and
the
asturias
he
had
therefore
to
take
into
consideration
the
chance
that
the
enemy
might
move
southward
and
fall
upon
his
line
of
communication
with
portugal
not
only
with
the
corps
of
soult
but
with
a
large
additional
force
unfortunately
the
information
that
had
reached
him
from
the
plains
of
leon
had
been
to
the
effect
that
ney
s
and
kellermann
s
troops
were
much
reduced
in
numbers
and
efficiency
so
that
even
when
they
had
joined
soult
the
total
of
the
french
field
army
upon
the
douro
would
not
much
exceed
men
this
misconception
affected
all
his
plans
for
if
the
hostile
force
about
salamanca
zamora
and
benavente
was
no
greater
than
was
reported
it
followed
that
any
expedition
sent
against
his
own
communications
could
not
be
more
than
or
strong
since
soult
would
be
forced
to
leave
a
containing
force
in
front
of
beresford
and
del
parque
who
now
lay
in
the
direction
of
almeida
and
ciudad
rodrigo
any
french
advance
against
bejar
and
plasencia
therefore
would
as
wellesley
supposed
be
a
mere
raid
executed
by
a
comparatively
small
force
he
doubted
whether
soult
dared
undertake
such
an
operation
the
enemy
he
wrote
would
not
like
to
venture
through
the
passes
into
estremadura
having
me
on
one
side
of
him
and
you
beresford
and
romana
upon
the
other
he
was
therefore
not
much
disturbed
in
mind
about
the
movements
of
the
french
in
the
valley
of
the
douro
if
he
had
but
known
that
not
men
but
men
were
now
concentrating
at
salamanca
his
feelings
would
have
been
far
different
but
it
was
not
till
some
days
later
that
it
began
to
dawn
upon
him
that
soult
was
far
stronger
than
he
had
supposed
and
that
there
might
be
serious
danger
to
be
feared
from
this
quarter
meanwhile
he
hoped
to
prevent
any
advance
of
the
french
in
the
direction
of
plasencia
by
causing
a
strong
demonstration
to
be
made
in
the
valley
of
the
douro
he
wrote
to
beresford
that
he
must
contrive
to
arrange
for
joint
action
with
la
romana
and
the
army
of
galicia
if
they
appeared
in
strength
in
the
direction
of
ciudad
rodrigo
the
duke
of
dalmatia
might
be
deterred
from
making
any
movement
to
the
south
if
however
the
spaniards
proved
helpless
or
impracticable
the
portuguese
army
would
have
to
confine
itself
to
the
defence
of
its
own
frontier
on
july
wellesley
writes
to
beresford
that
he
does
not
believe
that
ney
has
quitted
galicia
iv
because
of
the
tenour
of
the
captured
dispatches
of
soult
to
king
joseph
these
of
course
had
been
written
under
the
idea
that
the
corps
was
still
holding
on
to
corunna
and
lugo
it
was
not
till
some
days
later
that
soult
learned
of
his
colleagues
unexpected
move
but
wellesley
knew
of
ney
s
move
before
the
battle
of
talavera
as
is
shown
by
iv
the
enemy
have
on
the
douro
and
in
the
neighbourhood
not
less
than
men
being
the
remains
of
the
corps
of
soult
ney
and
to
frere
july
to
beresford
from
talavera
july
on
the
morning
of
july
wellesley
received
the
first
definite
information
which
led
him
to
conclude
that
the
french
forces
from
the
north
were
actually
contemplating
the
raid
upon
his
communications
which
on
the
preceding
day
he
had
regarded
as
doubtful
the
marquis
del
reino
whom
as
it
will
be
remembered
cuesta
had
sent
to
the
puerto
de
baños
with
two
weak
battalions
reported
that
troops
from
the
douro
valley
were
threatening
his
front
at
the
same
time
messages
were
received
from
the
alcaldes
of
fuente
roble
and
los
santos
places
on
the
road
between
salamanca
and
bejar
to
the
effect
that
they
had
received
orders
from
soult
to
prepare
and
rations
respectively
for
troops
due
to
arrive
on
july
the
numbers
given
counted
for
little
in
wellesley
s
estimation
since
it
is
the
commonest
thing
in
the
world
for
generals
to
requisition
food
for
a
far
larger
force
than
they
actually
bring
with
them
but
at
least
it
seemed
clear
that
some
considerable
detachment
from
salamanca
was
on
its
way
towards
the
puerto
de
baños
in
consequence
of
this
fact
wellesley
wrote
to
the
spanish
government
and
also
informed
cuesta
that
in
the
event
of
a
serious
attempt
of
the
enemy
to
cut
his
communications
he
should
move
so
as
to
take
care
of
himself
and
do
his
best
to
preserve
portugal
in
other
words
that
he
should
abandon
the
projected
march
on
madrid
which
had
been
his
main
purpose
on
the
preceding
day
he
was
still
however
under
the
impression
that
soult
had
no
very
large
force
with
him
as
is
sufficiently
shown
by
the
fact
that
on
the
he
suggested
to
cuesta
that
it
would
be
well
to
detach
one
of
his
divisions
say
men
to
strengthen
the
insignificant
force
which
was
already
in
position
at
the
puerto
de
baños
i
still
think
he
wrote
that
the
movements
of
general
beresford
with
the
portuguese
army
on
the
frontier
and
that
of
the
duque
del
parque
from
ciudad
rodrigo
combined
with
the
natural
difficulties
of
the
country
and
the
defence
by
the
marquis
del
reino
may
delay
the
enemy
s
advance
till
the
arrival
of
your
division
it
is
clear
that
when
he
wrote
in
these
terms
wellesley
was
still
labouring
under
the
delusion
that
soult
s
advance
was
a
mere
raid
executed
by
one
or
two
divisions
and
not
a
serious
operation
carried
out
by
a
large
army
wellesley
to
frere
july
my
first
duty
is
to
attend
to
the
safety
of
portugal
at
all
events
if
my
flank
and
communication
with
portugal
are
not
secured
for
me
while
i
am
operating
in
the
general
cause
i
must
move
to
take
care
of
myself
and
then
the
general
cause
will
wellesley
to
o
donoju
july
while
wellesley
was
spending
the
three
days
which
followed
the
battle
of
the
in
resting
his
men
and
pondering
over
his
next
move
the
enemies
whom
he
had
defeated
at
talavera
were
in
a
state
of
even
greater
uncertainty
and
indecision
by
daylight
on
july
as
we
have
already
seen
the
whole
french
army
had
retired
behind
the
alberche
leaving
only
a
screen
of
cavalry
upon
its
western
bank
the
king
was
under
the
impression
that
wellesley
and
cuesta
would
probably
follow
him
up
ere
the
day
had
passed
and
drew
up
his
whole
force
along
that
same
line
of
heights
which
victor
had
occupied
upon
the
and
of
the
month
but
when
nothing
appeared
in
his
front
during
the
morning
hours
save
a
few
vedettes
he
realized
that
he
might
count
upon
a
short
respite
and
took
new
measures
after
sending
off
to
his
brother
the
emperor
a
most
flagrantly
mendacious
account
of
the
battle
of
talavera
he
proceeded
to
divide
up
his
army
as
wellington
had
foreseen
he
detached
a
large
force
to
hold
back
venegas
and
the
army
of
la
mancha
who
were
at
last
coming
into
the
field
upon
his
flank
he
was
bound
to
do
so
under
pain
of
imperilling
the
safety
of
madrid
a
few
lines
of
this
astounding
document
may
be
worth
quoting
sire
hier
l
armée
anglaise
a
été
forcée
dans

outre
les
à

nous

arrivés
à

et
par
l
armée
de

qui
tente
de

par

j
ai
un
regret
sire
c
est
celui
de
n
avoir
pas
fait
prisonnière
toute
l
armée
de
vi
napoleon
not
deceived
for
a
moment
by
this
rhodomontade
sent
back
a
scathing
rebuke
to
his
brother
for
endeavouring
to
hide
the
truth
from
him
napoleon
to
jourdan
aug
it
is
time
to
cast
a
glance
at
the
operations
of
the
incompetent
general
whose
sloth
and
disobedience
had
wrecked
the
plan
that
wellesley
and
cuesta
had
drawn
out
at
their
conference
near
almaraz
on
july
venegas
had
begun
to
move
forward
from
el
moral
valdepeñas
and
santa
cruz
de
mudela
in
accordance
with
the
directions
that
had
been
sent
him
he
occupied
manzanares
and
daimiel
and
then
came
into
collision
with
sebastiani
s
cavalry
at
villaharta
and
herencia
for
the
corps
had
not
yet
begun
to
withdraw
towards
madrid
owing
to
the
profound
ignorance
in
which
the
enemy
still
lay
as
to
the
advance
of
wellesley
and
cuesta
sebastiani
had
not
on
the
nineteenth
received
any
order
to
fall
back
or
to
join
victor
and
the
king
thus
when
pressed
by
the
advanced
troops
of
venegas
he
did
not
retire
but
held
his
ground
and
showed
every
intention
of
accepting
battle
learning
from
the
peasantry
that
he
had
the
whole
of
the
corps
in
front
of
him
and
might
have
to
deal
with
nearly
men
the
spanish
general
halted
and
refused
to
advance
further
in
so
doing
he
was
fulfilling
the
spirit
of
the
instructions
that
had
been
sent
him
for
cuesta
and
wellesley
had
wished
him
to
detain
sebastiani
and
keep
in
touch
with
him
not
to
attack
him
or
to
fight
a
pitched
battle
they
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
the
frenchman
would
receive
early
news
of
their
own
advance
and
would
already
be
in
retreat
before
venegas
came
up
with
him
but
it
was
not
till
july
as
we
have
already
seen
that
victor
and
king
joseph
obtained
certain
intelligence
of
the
march
of
the
allies
upon
talavera
until
the
orders
for
a
retreat
arrived
from
madrid
the
corps
was
kept
in
its
old
position
at
madridejos
and
courted
rather
than
avoided
an
engagement
with
the
army
of
la
mancha
for
these
operations
i
am
relying
on
general
arteche
s
excerpts
from
the
de
los
published
by
venegas
in
his
own
defence
venegas
after
summoning
his
divisional
generals
to
a
council
of
war
refused
to
attack
sebastiani
and
wisely
for
his
men
would
certainly
have
been
beaten
by
the
frenchmen
who
still
lay
in
front
of
him
from
the
nineteenth
to
the
the
two
armies
faced
each
other
across
the
upper
guadiana
each
waiting
for
the
other
to
move
late
on
the
however
sebastiani
received
his
orders
to
evacuate
la
mancha
and
to
hasten
to
toledo
in
order
to
join
victor
and
the
king
in
a
combined
assault
upon
wellesley
and
cuesta
it
was
on
the
next
day
that
venegas
committed
the
ruinous
error
which
was
to
wreck
the
fate
of
the
whole
campaign
on
the
morning
of
the
the
corps
had
disappeared
from
his
front
instead
of
following
closely
in
the
rear
of
sebastiani
with
all
speed
and
molesting
his
retreat
as
his
orders
prescribed
he
made
no
attempt
to
prevent
the
corps
from
moving
off
nor
did
he
execute
that
rapid
flanking
march
on
aranjuez
or
fuentedueñas
which
his
instructions
prescribed
he
moved
forward
at
a
snail
s
pace
having
first
sent
off
to
cuesta
an
argumentative
letter
in
which
he
begged
for
leave
to
direct
his
advance
on
toledo
instead
of
on
the
points
which
had
been
named
in
his
orders
on
the
he
received
an
answer
in
which
his
authorized
him
to
make
his
own
choice
between
the
route
by
aranjuez
and
that
by
toledo
venegas
had
already
committed
the
fatal
error
of
letting
sebastiani
slip
away
unmolested
he
now
hesitated
between
the
idea
of
carrying
out
his
own
plan
and
that
of
obeying
cuesta
s
original
orders
and
after
much
hesitation
sent
his
first
division
under
general
lacy
towards
toledo
while
he
himself
with
the
other
four
marched
by
tembleque
upon
aranjuez
so
slow
and
cautious
was
their
advance
that
lacy
only
arrived
in
front
of
toledo
on
july
the
day
that
the
battle
of
talavera
was
fought
while
venegas
himself
occupied
aranjuez
hours
later
on
the
morning
of
the
he
had
taken
six
days
to
cross
the
sixty
miles
of
open
rolling
plain
which
lie
between
the
guadiana
and
the
tagus
though
he
had
been
absolutely
unopposed
by
the
enemy
whom
he
had
allowed
to
slip
away
from
his
front
sebastiani
had
marched
at
the
rate
of
twenty
miles
a
day
when
he
retired
from
madridejos
to
toledo
venegas
and
lacy
followed
at
the
rate
of
ten
and
twelve
miles
a
day
respectively
yet
the
special
duty
imposed
on
the
army
of
la
mancha
had
been
to
keep
in
touch
with
the
corps
further
comment
is
hardly
necessary
on
the
morning
of
the
day
when
wellesley
was
assailed
by
the
forces
of
victor
and
king
joseph
general
lacy
appeared
in
front
of
toledo
the
town
was
held
by
men
of
valence
s
polish
division
it
is
practically
impregnable
against
any
attack
from
the
south
presenting
to
that
side
a
front
of
sheer
cliff
overhanging
the
river
and
accessible
only
by
two
fortified
bridges
to
make
any
impression
on
the
place
lacy
would
have
had
to
cross
the
tagus
at
some
other
point
and
then
might
have
beset
the
comparatively
weak
northern
front
with
considerable
chances
of
success
but
he
contented
himself
with
demonstrating
against
the
bridges
and
discharging
some
fruitless
across
the
river
general
valence
the
governor
of
toledo
reported
to
jourdan
that
he
was
attacked
and
his
message
reaching
the
of
talavera
after
victor
s
second
repulse
had
a
certain
amount
of
influence
on
the
action
of
king
joseph
the
place
was
never
for
a
moment
in
danger
as
lacy
made
no
attempt
to
pass
the
tagus
in
order
to
press
his
attack
home
on
the
following
morning
july
venegas
reached
the
other
great
passage
of
the
tagus
at
aranjuez
with
two
of
his
divisions
and
occupied
the
place
after
driving
out
a
few
french
vedettes
he
pressed
his
cavalry
forward
to
the
line
of
the
tajuna
and
ere
nightfall
some
of
them
had
penetrated
almost
as
far
as
valdemoro
the
village
half
way
between
aranjuez
and
madrid
no
signs
of
any
serious
hostile
force
could
be
discovered
and
secret
friends
in
the
capital
sent
notice
that
they
were
being
held
down
by
a
very
weak
garrison
consisting
of
no
more
than
a
single
french
brigade
and
a
handful
of
the
king
s
spanish
levies
there
was
everything
to
tempt
venegas
to
execute
that
rapid
march
upon
the
capital
which
had
been
prescribed
in
his
original
orders
but
instead
of
doing
so
this
wretched
officer
halted
for
eight
whole
days
at
aranjuez
july
to
august
on
the
day
after
talavera
jourdan
and
joseph
had
not
yet
discovered
the
whereabouts
of
the
main
body
of
the
army
of
la
mancha
but
lacy
had
made
such
a
noisy
demonstration
in
front
of
toledo
that
they
were
inclined
to
believe
that
his
chief
must
be
close
behind
him
accordingly
the
garrison
of
toledo
was
reinforced
by
the
missing
brigade
of
valence
s
polish
division
and
raised
to
the
strength
of
men
the
king
with
the
rest
of
sebastiani
s
corps
and
his
own
guards
and
reserves
marched
to
santa
ollala
and
on
the
next
day
july
placed
himself
at
bargas
a
few
miles
in
rear
of
toledo
in
this
position
he
would
have
been
wholly
unable
to
protect
madrid
if
venegas
had
pressed
forward
on
that
same
morning
from
aranjuez
for
that
place
is
actually
nearer
to
the
capital
than
the
village
at
which
joseph
had
fixed
his
head
quarters
the
sloth
displayed
by
the
spanish
general
was
the
only
thing
which
preserved
madrid
from
capture
on
august
apprised
of
the
fact
that
the
main
body
of
the
army
of
la
mancha
was
at
aranjuez
and
not
before
toledo
joseph
transferred
his
army
to
illescas
a
point
from
which
he
would
be
able
to
attack
venegas
in
flank
if
the
latter
should
move
forward
only
milhaud
s
division
of
dragoons
was
thrown
forward
to
valdemoro
on
the
direct
road
from
aranjuez
to
madrid
it
drove
out
of
the
village
a
regiment
of
spanish
horse
which
reported
to
venegas
that
there
was
now
a
heavy
force
in
his
front
for
the
next
four
days
the
king
s
troops
and
the
army
of
venegas
retained
their
respective
positions
each
waiting
for
the
other
to
move
the
spaniard
had
realized
that
his
chance
of
capturing
madrid
had
gone
by
and
remained
in
a
state
of
indecision
at
aranjuez
joseph
was
waiting
for
definite
news
of
the
movements
of
wellesley
and
cuesta
before
risking
an
attack
on
the
army
of
la
mancha
he
saw
that
it
had
abandoned
the
offensive
and
did
not
wish
to
move
off
from
his
central
position
at
illescas
till
he
was
sure
that
victor
was
not
in
need
of
any
help
yet
he
was
so
disturbed
as
to
the
general
state
of
affairs
that
he
sent
orders
to
general
belliard
at
madrid
to
evacuate
all
and
civilians
on
to
valladolid
and
to
prepare
to
shut
himself
up
in
the
retiro
the
doings
of
victor
during
the
five
days
after
he
had
separated
from
the
king
require
a
more
lengthy
consideration
left
behind
upon
the
alberche
with
the
corps
which
the
casualties
of
the
battle
had
reduced
to
no
more
than
men
he
felt
himself
in
a
perilous
position
if
the
allies
should
advance
he
could
do
no
more
than
endeavour
to
retard
their
march
on
madrid
whether
he
could
count
on
any
further
aid
from
the
king
and
sebastiani
would
depend
on
the
wholly
problematical
movements
of
venegas
somewhat
to
his
surprise
wellesley
and
cuesta
remained
quiescent
not
only
on
the
but
on
the
thirtieth
of
july
but
an
alarm
now
came
from
another
quarter
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
enterprising
sir
robert
wilson
with
men
partly
spaniards
partly
portuguese
of
the
lusitanian
legion
had
moved
parallel
with
wellesley
s
northern
flank
during
the
advance
to
talavera
on
the
day
of
the
battle
he
had
marched
to
the
cannon
as
a
good
officer
should
and
had
actually
approached
cazalegas
at
the
back
of
the
french
army
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
learning
of
the
results
of
the
fight
he
had
turned
back
to
his
old
path
upon
the
and
had
entered
escalona
on
the
upper
alberche
at
this
place
he
was
behind
victor
s
flank
and
lay
only
miles
from
madrid
there
was
no
french
force
between
him
and
the
capital
and
if
only
his
division
had
been
a
little
stronger
he
would
have
been
justified
in
making
a
raid
upon
the
city
relying
for
aid
upon
the
insurrection
that
would
indubitably
have
broken
out
the
moment
that
he
presented
himself
before
its
gates
it
was
reported
to
victor
on
the
thirtieth
not
only
that
wilson
was
at
escalona
but
also
that
he
was
at
the
head
of
a
strong
portuguese
division
estimated
at
or
men
the
marshal
determined
that
he
could
not
venture
to
leave
such
a
force
upon
his
rear
while
the
armies
of
wellesley
and
cuesta
were
in
his
front
and
fell
back
ten
miles
to
maqueda
on
the
high
road
to
madrid
on
the
following
day
still
uneasy
as
to
his
position
he
retired
still
further
to
santa
cruz
and
wrote
to
king
joseph
that
he
might
be
forced
to
continue
his
retreat
as
far
as
mostoles
almost
in
the
suburbs
of
madrid
he
was
so
badly
informed
as
to
the
movements
of
the
allies
that
he
not
only
warned
the
king
that
wilson
was
threatening
madrid
but
assured
him
that
the
british
army
from
talavera
had
broken
up
from
its
cantonments
and
was
advancing
along
the
alberche
towards
the
capital
joseph
better
instructed
as
to
the
actual
situation
of
affairs
replied
by
assuring
him
that
wellesley
and
cuesta
were
far
more
likely
to
be
retreating
on
almaraz
than
marching
on
madrid
as
they
must
have
heard
ere
now
of
soult
s
advance
on
plasencia
he
ordered
the
marshal
to
fall
back
no
further
and
to
send
a
division
to
feel
for
wilson
at
escalona
on
detaching
villatte
to
execute
this
reconnaissance
victor
was
surprised
to
find
that
sir
robert
s
little
force
had
already
evacuated
its
advanced
position
and
had
retreated
into
the
mountains
for
the
last
four
days
indeed
victor
had
been
fighting
with
shadows
for
the
british
and
estremaduran
armies
had
never
passed
the
alberche
while
wilson
had
absconded
from
escalona
on
receiving
from
wellesley
the
news
that
soult
had
been
heard
of
at
the
puerto
de
baños
in
consequence
of
the
needless
march
of
the
corps
to
maqueda
and
santa
cruz
the
allied
generals
were
able
to
withdraw
unmolested
and
even
unobserved
from
talavera
and
were
far
upon
their
way
down
the
tagus
before
their
absence
was
suspected
the
erratic
movements
of
victor
may
be
excused
in
part
by
the
uniform
difficulty
in
obtaining
accurate
information
which
the
french
always
experienced
in
spain
but
even
when
this
allowance
is
made
it
must
be
confessed
that
his
operations
do
not
tend
to
give
us
any
very
high
idea
of
his
strategical
ability
he
was
clearly
one
of
those
generals
of
the
class
denounced
by
napoleon
se
font
des
who
argue
on
insufficient
data
and
take
a
long
time
to
be
convinced
of
the
error
of
their
original
hypothesis
jourdan
to
belliard
from
illescas
le
duc
de
belluno
dit
que
toute
l
armée
anglaise
marche
sur
la
rive
droite
de
l
alberche
et
qu
hier
elle
était
à
une
lieue
d
neither
victor
nor
king
joseph
therefore
exercised
any
influence
over
the
doings
of
wellesley
and
cuesta
at
talavera
between
the
of
july
and
the
of
august
the
allies
worked
out
their
plans
undisturbed
by
any
interference
on
the
part
of
the
old
enemies
whom
they
had
beaten
on
the
battle
day
down
to
august
the
british
general
had
been
unconvinced
by
the
rumours
of
soult
s
approach
at
the
head
of
a
large
army
which
were
persistently
arriving
from
the
secret
agents
in
the
direction
of
salamanca
it
was
only
on
the
evening
of
that
day
that
he
received
news
so
precise
and
so
threatening
that
he
found
himself
forced
to
abandon
for
the
moment
any
intention
of
pushing
on
towards
madrid
in
consequence
of
the
impending
attack
on
the
line
of
his
communications
with
portugal
it
was
announced
to
him
that
the
vanguard
of
the
french
army
from
the
north
had
actually
entered
bejar
on
the
and
was
driving
in
the
trifling
force
under
the
marquis
del
reino
which
cuesta
had
sent
to
the
puerto
de
baños
there
are
two
letters
of
wellington
to
castlereagh
written
on
both
indicate
that
wellesley
was
still
unconvinced
as
to
soult
s
intention
and
the
second
states
that
he
does
not
believe
that
the
french
will
pass
the
puerto
de
baños
the
definite
news
came
at
night
whatever
might
be
the
force
at
soult
s
disposal
and
wellesley
was
still
under
the
delusion
that
it
amounted
at
most
to
a
single
corps
of
or
men
it
was
impossible
to
allow
the
french
to
establish
themselves
between
the
british
army
and
portugal
if
they
were
at
bejar
on
the
they
might
easily
reach
plasencia
on
the
on
receiving
the
news
cuesta
who
had
hitherto
shown
the
greatest
reluctance
to
divide
his
army
detached
his
division
under
bassecourt
with
orders
to
set
out
at
the
greatest
possible
speed
and
join
the
marquis
del
reino
this
move
was
tardy
and
useless
for
it
is
four
long
marches
from
talavera
to
plasencia
so
that
bassecourt
must
arrive
too
late
to
hold
the
defiles
if
he
found
the
french
already
established
on
the
river
alagon
his
men
would
be
utterly
inadequate
to
contain
double
or
triple
that
number
of
soult
s
troops
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
enemy
had
entered
plasencia
on
the
afternoon
of
august
before
the
spanish
division
had
even
commenced
its
movement
to
the
west
napier
seems
to
have
the
dates
wrong
here
he
says
that
the
corps
seized
plasencia
on
july
vol
ii
but
soult
s
official
report
to
the
minister
of
war
dated
says
that
his
vanguard
forced
the
puerto
de
baños
on
the
but
only
captured
plasencia
on
if
plasencia
had
fallen
on
the
wellesley
and
cuesta
would
have
known
the
fact
on
the
second
but
as
it
was
captured
on
the
first
only
they
were
still
in
ignorance
when
their
conference
took
place
on
the
morning
of
august
wellesley
and
cuesta
held
a
long
and
stormy
conference
the
proposed
that
wellesley
should
detach
half
his
force
to
assist
bassecourt
and
stay
with
the
remainder
at
talavera
in
order
to
support
the
army
of
estremadura
against
any
renewed
attack
by
victor
and
king
joseph
the
english
commander
refused
to
divide
his
force
he
had
only
effectives
even
after
craufurd
had
joined
him
and
such
a
small
body
would
not
bear
division
but
he
offered
either
to
march
against
soult
with
his
entire
host
or
to
remain
at
talavera
if
his
colleague
preferred
to
set
out
for
plasencia
with
his
main
body
cuesta
chose
the
former
alternative
and
on
the
morning
of
the
third
wellesley
moved
out
with
every
available
man
intending
to
attack
the
enemy
at
the
earliest
opportunity
he
was
still
under
the
impression
that
he
would
have
to
deal
with
no
more
than
a
single
french
corps
and
was
confident
of
the
result
his
only
fear
was
that
victor
might
descend
upon
talavera
in
his
absence
and
that
cuesta
might
evacuate
the
place
on
being
attacked
if
this
should
happen
the
english
hospitals
in
which
there
lay
nearly
wounded
might
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
on
halting
at
oropesa
he
sent
back
a
note
to
o
donoju
the
chief
of
the
staff
of
the
estremaduran
army
begging
him
to
send
off
westward
all
the
british
wounded
who
were
in
a
condition
to
travel
he
asked
that
country
carts
might
be
requisitioned
for
their
assistance
if
no
transport
could
be
spared
by
the
spanish
troops
wellesley
s
letters
in
these
critical
days
are
full
of
complaints
as
to
his
colleague
s
impracticability
i
certainly
should
get
the
better
of
everything
he
writes
to
castlereagh
if
i
could
manage
general
cuesta
but
his
temper
and
disposition
are
so
bad
that
this
is
iv
wellesley
to
o
donoju
from
oropesa
afternoon
of
wellesley
was
setting
out
with
men
to
attack
not
the
mere
men
that
he
believed
to
be
in
his
front
but
three
whole
d
with
a
strength
of
sabres
and
bayonets
in
his
long
career
there
were
many
dangerous
crises
but
this
was
perhaps
the
most
perilous
of
all
if
he
had
remained
for
a
little
longer
in
ignorance
of
the
real
situation
he
might
have
found
himself
involved
in
a
contest
in
which
defeat
was
certain
and
destruction
highly
probable
the
real
situation
in
his
front
was
as
follows
on
receiving
the
dispatch
from
madrid
which
permitted
him
to
execute
his
projected
march
upon
plasencia
soult
had
begun
to
concentrate
his
army
july
mortier
and
the
corps
were
already
in
march
for
salamanca
in
pursuance
of
earlier
orders
they
arrived
in
its
neighbourhood
the
same
day
on
which
foy
brought
the
king
s
orders
to
his
chief
the
corps
was
already
massed
upon
the
tormes
and
ready
to
move
the
moment
that
it
should
receive
the
supply
of
artillery
which
had
been
so
long
upon
its
way
from
madrid
ney
and
the
corps
from
benavente
and
astorga
had
far
to
come
they
only
reached
salamanca
on
july
if
we
remember
that
the
distance
from
astorga
to
the
concentration
point
was
no
less
than
ninety
miles
we
cease
to
wonder
at
their
tardy
arrival
soult
had
strict
orders
from
the
emperor
to
march
with
his
troops
well
closed
up
and
not
to
risk
the
danger
of
being
caught
with
his
corps
strung
out
at
distances
which
would
permit
of
their
being
met
and
defeated
in
detail
he
was
therefore
entirely
justified
in
refusing
to
move
until
the
corps
should
be
in
supporting
distance
of
the
rest
of
his
army
and
the
corps
should
have
received
the
cannon
which
were
needed
to
replace
the
pieces
that
they
had
lost
in
portugal
for
this
reason
we
must
regard
as
unfounded
all
the
vehement
reproaches
heaped
upon
him
by
joseph
and
jourdan
during
the
acrimonious
correspondence
that
followed
upon
the
end
of
the
campaign
it
would
have
been
wrong
to
start
the
corps
upon
its
way
to
plasencia
till
the
corps
was
ready
to
follow
and
the
much
needed
guns
only
came
into
salamanca
on
the
though
their
approach
had
been
reported
on
the
preceding
day
orders
of
napoleon

mais
surtout
pour
un
pays
où

on
ne
peut

de
we
can
not
therefore
blame
soult
for
sloth
or
slackness
when
we
find
that
he
started
mortier
upon
his
way
on
july
and
followed
him
with
his
own
corps
upon
july
the
day
after
the
guns
arrived
and
the
day
before
ney
and
his
troops
were
due
to
reach
salamanca
from
the
north
the
order
of
march
was
as
follows
the
vanguard
was
composed
of
the
whole
corps
of
mortier
nearly
strong
reinforced
by
three
brigades
of
dragoons
under
lahoussaye
and
lorges
with
a
strength
of
sabres
the
corps
followed
though
it
started
three
days
later
than
the
it
was
gradually
gaining
ground
on
the
vanguard
all
through
the
march
as
it
had
no
fighting
to
do
or
reconnaissances
to
execute
hence
it
was
only
hours
behind
mortier
in
arriving
at
plasencia
its
strength
was
men
even
after
it
had
detached
the
brigades
of
dragoons
to
strengthen
the
vanguard
and
placed
five
battalions
at
the
disposal
of
general
kellermann
during
its
stay
at
zamora
and
toro
it
had
picked
up
a
mass
of
convalescents
and
details
who
had
not
taken
part
in
its
galician
campaign
the
rear
was
formed
by
ney
s
troops
which
started
from
salamanca
only
one
day
behind
the
corps
the
infantry
was
not
complete
as
a
brigade
of
men
was
left
behind
on
the
douro
to
assist
kellermann
in
holding
down
the
kingdom
of
leon
hence
even
including
a
brigade
of
lorges
dragoons
the
corps
had
only
some
men
on
the
march
the
whole
army
therefore
as
it
will
be
seen
was
about
strong
by
the
return
of
july
the
corps
had
men
the
attached
brigades
of
dragoons
the
corps
had
deducting
lorges
and
lahoussaye
the
corps
of
whom
one
brigade
of
infantry
bayonets
was
left
behind
the
total
then
was
the
marshal
had
dissolved
one
of
his
four
divisions
that
of
mermet
making
over
the
of
the
line
reduced
to
two
battalions
and
the
swiss
units
to
kellermann
and
distributing
the
other
regiments
between
merle
delaborde
and
heudelet
just
before
he
marched
from
salamanca
soult
had
heard
that
beresford
s
portuguese
were
commencing
to
show
themselves
in
force
in
the
direction
of
almeida
while
del
parque
s
small
division
at
ciudad
rodrigo
was
beginning
to
be
reinforced
by
troops
descending
from
the
mountains
of
galicia
trusting
that
the
danger
from
this
quarter
might
not
prove
imminent
the
marshal
left
in
observation
of
the
allies
only
the
remains
of
the
force
that
kellermann
had
brought
back
from
the
asturias
the
division
of
dragoons
and
a
few
battalions
of
infantry
strengthened
by
the
five
battalions
from
the
corps
and
the
one
brigade
detached
from
ney
the
whole
did
not
amount
to
more
than
or
men
scattered
along
the
whole
front
from
astorga
to
salamanca
it
was
clear
that
much
was
risked
in
this
direction
for
beresford
and
del
parque
could
concentrate
over
troops
for
an
attack
on
any
point
that
they
might
select
but
soult
was
prepared
to
accept
the
chances
of
war
in
the
douro
valley
rightly
thinking
that
if
he
could
crush
wellesley
s
army
on
the
tagus
any
losses
in
the
north
could
easily
be
repaired
it
would
matter
little
if
the
spaniards
and
portuguese
occupied
salamanca
or
even
valladolid
after
the
british
had
been
destroyed
mortier
starting
on
july
on
the
road
by
fuente
roble
and
los
santos
made
two
marches
without
coming
in
touch
with
any
enemy
it
was
only
on
the
third
day
that
he
met
at
la
calzada
the
vedettes
of
the
trifling
force
under
the
marquis
del
reino
which
cuesta
had
sent
to
hold
the
puerto
de
baños
after
chasing
them
through
bejar
the
marshal
came
upon
their
supports
drawn
up
in
the
pass
july
del
reino
thought
himself
obliged
to
fight
though
he
had
but
four
battalions
with
a
total
of
or
bayonets
he
was
of
course
dislodged
with
ease
by
the
overwhelming
numbers
which
mortier
turned
against
him
the
first
division
of
the
corps
alone
sufficed
to
drive
him
through
the
pass
thereupon
he
retired
down
the
alagon
and
after
sending
news
of
his
defeat
to
cuesta
fell
back
to
almaraz
where
he
took
up
the
bridge
of
boats
and
removed
it
to
the
southern
bank
of
the
tagus
cuesta
in
a
dispatch
in
the
de
la
which
seems
unpublished
says
that
del
reino
fought
with
four
battalions
he
had
started
with
no
more
than
two
so
must
have
rallied
two
others
i
can
find
no
trace
of
what
they
were
but
conclude
that
they
must
have
been
some
of
those
battalions
of
the
army
of
estremadura
which
are
not
named
in
the
de
of
the
divisions
present
at
talavera
as
i
have
shown
in
my
talavera
appendix
there
were
eight
regiments
which
had
belonged
to
cuesta
s
army
in
march
but
do
not
appear
in
the
divisional
return
of
july
most
of
these
were
in
garrison
at
badajoz
but
two
or
three
may
well
have
been
sent
to
guard
the
passes
when
the
army
advanced
from
the
guadiana
in
the
end
of
june
having
cleared
the
passes
upon
the
thirtieth
the
corps
advanced
to
candelaria
and
baños
de
bejar
upon
the
and
entered
plasencia
on
the
first
of
august
here
mortier
captured
of
wellesley
s
sick
who
had
been
left
behind
as
being
incapable
of
removal
on
the
preceding
day
the
town
had
been
full
of
british
detachments
the
place
was
the
house
between
portugal
and
talavera
and
many
commissaries
isolated
officers
going
to
or
from
the
front
and
details
marching
to
join
their
corps
had
been
collected
there
captain
pattison
the
senior
officer
present
withdrew
to
zarza
with
every
man
that
could
march
when
he
heard
of
mortier
s
approach
taking
with
him
a
convoy
which
had
recently
arrived
from
abrantes
but
he
was
obliged
to
leave
behind
him
a
considerable
amount
of
corn
just
collected
from
the
vera
which
had
been
destined
for
wellesley
s
army
the
whole
civil
population
of
plasencia
fled
to
the
hills
in
obedience
to
an
order
of
the
local
junta
and
the
british
soldiers
in
the
hospital
were
the
only
living
beings
whom
the
french
vanguard
found
in
the
city
the
men
of
the
corps
plundered
the
deserted
houses
as
was
but
natural
but
behaved
with
much
humanity
to
the
captured
invalids
for
details
of
mortier
s
march
see
the
memoir
of
naylies
of
lahoussaye
s
dragoons
who
was
with
the
vanguard
according
to
the
of
fantin
des
odoards
soult
pushed
his
kindness
to
the
british
invalids
so
far
as
to
leave
with
them
a
small
supply
of
muskets
with
which
to
defend
themselves
against
guerrillas
after
seizing
plasencia
mortier
halted
for
a
day
in
obedience
to
soult
s
orders
that
he
might
allow
the
corps
to
close
up
before
he
pressed
in
any
further
towards
wellesley
the
duke
of
dalmatia
was
determined
to
run
no
risks
when
dealing
with
an
adversary
so
enterprising
as
his
old
enemy
of
oporto
on
august
he
himself
and
the
leading
divisions
of
his
corps
reached
plasencia
the
rest
were
close
behind
on
the
same
afternoon
therefore
the
advance
could
be
resumed
and
mortier
set
out
on
the
high
road
towards
almaraz
and
talavera
having
eight
regiments
of
horse
men
in
his
front
he
slept
that
night
at
malpartida
seven
miles
in
advance
of
plasencia
and
moved
on
next
morning
to
the
line
of
the
tietar
and
the
village
of
toril
one
of
his
reconnoitring
parties
approached
the
bridge
of
almaraz
and
found
it
broken
another
reached
navalmoral
he
was
now
drawing
very
close
to
wellesley
who
had
encamped
that
day
at
oropesa
and
was
only
thirty
miles
away
indeed
the
british
and
the
french
cavalry
came
in
contact
that
evening
in
front
of
navalmoral
on
august
by
a
curious
coincidence
each
was
at
last
informed
of
his
adversary
s
strength
and
intentions
by
a
captured
dispatch
a
spanish
messenger
was
arrested
by
soult
s
cavalry
while
bearing
a
letter
from
wellesley
to
general
erskine
dated
august
in
this
document
there
was
an
account
of
the
battle
of
talavera
which
had
hitherto
been
unknown
to
soult
but
the
most
important
clause
of
it
was
a
request
to
erskine
to
find
out
whether
the
rumours
reporting
the
advance
of
french
towards
the
puerto
de
baños
were
correct
the
duke
of
dalmatia
thus
discovered
that
his
adversary
only
two
days
before
was
grossly
underrating
the
numbers
of
the
army
that
was
marching
against
his
rear
he
was
led
on
to
hope
that
wellesley
would
presently
advance
against
him
with
inferior
numbers
and
court
destruction
by
attacking
the
united
and
corps
see
le
noble
this
indeed
might
have
come
to
pass
had
not
the
allies
on
the
same
day
become
possessed
of
a
french
dispatch
which
revealed
to
them
the
real
situation
of
affairs
some
guerrillas
in
the
neighbourhood
of
avila
intercepted
a
friar
who
was
an
agent
of
king
joseph
and
was
bearing
a
letter
from
him
to
soult
they
brought
the
paper
to
cuesta
on
august
it
contained
not
only
an
account
of
the
king
s
plans
and
projects
but
orders
for
the
marshal
which
mentioned
ney
and
the
corps
and
showed
that
the
force
marching
on
plasencia
was
at
least
double
the
strength
that
wellesley
had
expected
this
letter
cuesta
sent
on
to
his
colleague
with
laudable
promptness
it
reached
the
british
commander
in
time
to
save
him
from
taking
the
irreparable
step
of
marching
from
oropesa
to
navalmoral
where
the
vanguard
of
mortier
s
cavalry
had
just
been
met
by
the
vedettes
of
cotton
s
light
horse
wellesley
had
actually
written
to
bassecourt
to
bid
him
halt
at
centinello
till
he
himself
should
arrive
and
then
to
join
him
in
an
attack
on
the
french
when
he
was
handed
the
intercepted
letter
which
showed
that
soult
had
at
least
men
in
hand
see
arteche
vi
and
iv
the
letter
itself
is
not
published
by
gurwood
but
lord
londonderry
then
on
wellesley
s
staff
gives
an
analysis
of
it
it
contained
according
to
him
orders
to
soult
to
hasten
his
march
and
to
bring
up
ney
s
corps
with
all
speed
while
the
king
himself
undertook
to
threaten
talavera
again
with
victor
s
forces
londonderry
wellesley
to
bassecourt
from
oropesa
august
so
confident
was
the
british
commander
at
this
moment
that
he
wrote
to
beresford
on
the
same
morning
telling
him
that
soult
when
assailed
would
probably
retire
at
once
either
by
the
pass
of
perales
or
that
of
baños
he
wished
his
lieutenant
to
send
portuguese
troops
to
the
outlets
of
those
defiles
to
intercept
the
retreating
enemy
this
unpalatable
news
changed
the
whole
prospect
of
affairs
it
would
be
mad
to
assail
such
an
enemy
with
a
force
consisting
of
no
more
than
british
troops
and
bassecourt
s
spaniards
wellesley
had
therefore
to
reconsider
the
whole
situation
and
to
dictate
a
new
plan
of
campaign
at
very
short
notice
since
his
cavalry
were
actually
in
touch
with
the
enemy
at
the
distance
of
a
single
day
s
march
from
oropesa
on
the
morrow
he
must
either
fight
or
fly
the
situation
was
made
more
complicated
by
the
fact
that
cuesta
when
forwarding
the
french
dispatch
had
sent
information
to
the
effect
that
he
considered
his
own
situation
at
talavera
so
much
compromised
that
he
was
about
to
retreat
at
once
with
the
design
of
crossing
the
tagus
at
almaraz
and
of
taking
up
once
more
his
old
line
of
communications
which
ran
by
truxillo
to
badajoz
it
may
be
asked
why
the
did
not
adopt
the
simpler
course
of
crossing
the
tagus
at
talavera
and
moving
under
cover
of
the
river
instead
of
executing
the
long
flank
march
by
oropesa
to
almaraz
on
the
exposed
bank
where
the
french
were
known
to
be
in
movement
the
answer
however
is
simple
and
conclusive
the
paths
which
lead
southward
from
talavera
are
impracticable
for
artillery
and
wheeled
vehicles
infantry
alone
could
have
retreated
by
the
route
which
climbs
up
to
the
puerto
de
san
vincente
the
main
pass
of
this
section
of
the
sierra
de
guadalupe
nor
was
the
track
along
the
edge
of
the
river
from
talavera
to
arzobispo
any
better
fitted
for
the
transport
of
a
large
army
it
is
this
want
of
any
adequate
communication
with
the
south
which
makes
talavera
such
a
dangerous
position
no
retreat
from
it
is
possible
save
that
by
the
road
to
oropesa
unless
the
retiring
army
is
prepared
to
sacrifice
all
its
impedimenta
cuesta
has
been
criticized
in
the
most
savage
style
by
many
english
writers
from
lord
londonderry
and
napier
downwards
for
his
hasty
departure
from
talavera
it
is
fair
to
state
in
his
defence
the
fact
that
if
he
had
tarried
any
longer
in
his
present
position
he
might
have
been
cut
off
not
merely
from
almaraz
that
passage
was
already
impracticable
but
also
from
the
bridge
of
arzobispo
the
only
other
crossing
of
the
tagus
by
which
artillery
and
heavy
wagons
can
pass
southward
if
he
had
started
on
the
fourth
instead
of
the
third
he
might
have
found
mortier
and
soult
interposed
between
him
and
this
last
line
of
retreat
he
would
then
have
been
forced
to
abandon
all
his
and
to
hurry
back
to
talavera
in
order
to
take
the
track
to
the
puerto
de
san
vincente
but
there
was
every
reason
to
believe
that
victor
might
arrive
in
front
of
talavera
on
the
evening
of
the
fourth
or
the
morning
of
the
fifth
so
that
this
last
road
to
safety
might
have
been
already
blocked
thus
the
spanish
army
if
it
had
started
on
the
fourth
for
oropesa
might
have
found
itself
caught
between
the
two
french
corps
and
vowed
to
inevitable
destruction
as
a
matter
of
fact
victor
moved
slowly
and
cautiously
and
only
reached
talavera
on
the
sixth
but
this
could
not
possibly
have
been
foreseen
we
can
not
therefore
blame
cuesta
s
precipitate
departure
upon
the
night
of
august
his
main
body
marched
under
cover
of
the
darkness
to
oropesa
where
they
arrived
much
wearied
and
in
some
disorder
on
the
following
morning
he
left
zayas
s
division
and
albuquerque
s
horse
as
a
rearguard
to
hold
talavera
till
midday
on
the
fourth
with
orders
to
make
a
semblance
of
resistance
and
to
detain
victor
for
a
few
hours
if
he
should
appear
but
no
hostile
force
showed
itself
by
his
unwise
retreat
to
santa
cruz
the
marshal
had
drawn
back
so
far
from
the
enemy
that
he
could
not
take
advantage
of
their
retrograde
movement
when
it
became
known
to
him
villatte
s
division
and
beaumont
s
cavalry
only
reached
talavera
on
the
morning
of
the
sixth
the
departure
of
the
estremaduran
army
had
one
deplorable
result
it
exposed
the
english
hospitals
at
talavera
with
their
wounded
to
capture
by
the
enemy
wellesley
before
he
had
marched
off
had
given
orders
that
all
the
men
capable
of
being
moved
should
be
sent
off
towards
plasencia
and
portugal
as
soon
as
possible
but
he
had
no
transport
that
could
cope
with
the
task
of
transferring
such
a
mass
of
invalids
towards
his
base
he
wrote
from
oropesa
begging
cuesta
to
requisition
carts
from
the
for
this
purpose
but
it
was
notorious
that
carts
were
not
to
be
had
all
wellesley
s
letters
for
the
last
three
weeks
were
full
of
complaints
to
the
effect
that
he
could
not
procure
them
by
money
or
by
force
when
the
spaniards
were
themselves
departing
bag
and
baggage
it
was
an
inopportune
moment
at
which
to
ask
them
to
provide
transport
yet
since
the
british
wounded
had
been
left
to
their
care
they
were
bound
in
honour
to
do
all
that
could
be
done
to
save
them
it
is
said
that
cuesta
made
over
no
more
than
seven
and
a
few
mules
to
colonel
mackinnon
the
officer
charged
with
the
task
of
evacuating
the
hospitals
these
and
about
forty
vehicles
of
various
kinds
belonging
to
the
british
themselves
were
all
that
could
be
procured
for
the
use
of
the
wounded
they
could
only
accommodate
a
tithe
of
the
serious
cases
the
men
with
hurts
of
less
consequence
were
forced
to
set
out
upon
their
feet
the
road
to
oropesa
writes
one
of
their
fellow
sufferers
was
covered
with
our
poor
limping
bloodless
soldiers
on
crutches
or
sticks
with
blankets
thrown
over
them
they
hobbled
woefully
along
for
the
moment
panic
terror
lent
them
a
force
inconsistent
with
their
debility
and
their
fresh
wounds
some
died
by
the
road
others
unable
to
get
further
than
oropesa
afterwards
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
the
rest
trailed
onward
to
the
bridge
of
arzobispo
where
wellesley
provided
transport
for
many
of
them
by
unloading
and
ultimately
reached
truxillo
at
which
place
the
new
hospitals
were
established
of
the
whole
about
had
been
left
at
talavera
as
hopeless
or
dangerous
cases
and
these
became
the
captives
of
the
french
drifted
in
at
various
times
to
truxillo
the
remaining
expired
by
the
wayside
or
were
taken
by
the
french
in
the
villages
where
they
had
dropped
down
wellesley
to
o
donoju
i
am
bound
to
say
that
after
reading
the
spanish
narratives
i
doubt
whether
cuesta
had
at
his
disposal
the
large
amount
of
spare
vehicles
of
which
londonderry
and
napier
speak
boothby
prisoner
of
for
the
adventures
of
two
wounded
officers
on
their
weary
way
to
truxillo
see
the
of
hawker
and
the
narrative
of
colonel
leslie
the
latter
made
a
personal
appeal
to
cuesta
whose
carriage
he
had
met
by
the
roadside
the
old
general
sent
for
the
alcalde
and
made
him
provide
a
mule
though
it
turned
out
to
be
a
very
bad
one
for
the
wounded
officer
this
small
fact
to
his
credit
needs
recording
after
the
copious
abuse
heaped
on
him
the
invalids
were
admirably
cared
for
by
the
enemy
see
boothby
long
before
cuesta
and
his
host
had
arrived
at
oropesa
wellesley
had
made
up
his
mind
that
the
only
course
open
to
him
was
to
abandon
the
march
towards
navalmoral
and
almaraz
and
to
turn
aside
to
the
bridge
of
arzobispo
as
the
french
were
known
to
be
at
navalmoral
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
force
a
passage
to
almaraz
without
a
battle
if
the
enemy
were
to
be
estimated
at
two
corps
or
men
according
to
the
indications
of
the
intercepted
letter
they
would
probably
be
able
to
detain
the
army
till
victor
should
arrive
from
the
rear
for
without
accepting
a
pitched
battle
they
would
be
strong
enough
to
harass
and
check
the
allies
and
to
prevent
them
from
reaching
almaraz
till
the
corps
should
come
upon
the
scene
i
was
not
certain
wrote
wellesley
to
beresford
two
days
later
that
ney
was
not
with
soult
and
i
certain
that
if
not
with
him
he
was
at
no
great
distance
we
should
therefore
have
had
a
battle
to
fight
in
order
to
gain
the
road
to
almaraz
plasencia
was
then
out
of
the
question
and
if
victor
had
followed
cuesta
as
he
ought
to
have
done
another
battle
probably
before
the
bridge
could
be
then
it
was
to
be
considered
that
cuesta
having
left
talavera
the
bridge
of
arzobispo
would
have
been
open
to
the
enemy
s
enterprise
if
they
had
destroyed
it
while
we
had
failed
in
forcing
soult
at
navalmoral
we
were
the
marquis
del
reino
it
will
be
remembered
had
broken
the
of
almaraz
on
august
after
abandoning
the
puerto
de
baños
it
is
impossible
not
to
bow
before
wellesley
s
reasoning
the
french
critics
object
that
only
mortier
was
at
navalmoral
on
august
soult
being
twenty
miles
behind
him
at
bazagona
on
the
tietar
so
that
it
would
have
been
possible
for
the
british
army
to
have
driven
back
the
men
of
the
duke
of
treviso
and
to
have
forced
its
way
to
almaraz
but
even
if
wellesley
had
fought
a
successful
action
with
mortier
on
august
soult
would
certainly
have
joined
his
colleague
on
the
fifth
before
the
bridge
could
have
been
repaired
or
at
any
rate
before
the
whole
army
and
all
its
impedimenta
could
have
crossed
the
tagus
if
attacked
during
their
passage
by
the
men
of
the
and
corps
they
would
have
fared
badly
wellesley
was
perfectly
correct
in
his
decision
indeed
the
only
point
in
which
he
was
deceived
was
that
he
believed
the
enemy
in
his
front
to
be
soult
s
and
ney
s
corps
whereas
they
were
in
reality
those
of
soult
and
mortier
ney
only
reached
plasencia
on
august
and
did
not
join
the
main
body
of
the
army
till
two
days
later
see
for
example
le
noble
pp
when
wellesley
and
cuesta
met
at
oropesa
early
on
the
morning
of
august
they
found
themselves
as
usual
engaged
in
a
heated
controversy
the
british
general
had
directed
his
divisions
to
hold
themselves
ready
to
march
on
the
bridge
of
arzobispo
without
further
delay
cuesta
on
the
other
hand
had
been
attacked
by
a
recrudescence
of
his
old
disease
the
mania
for
fighting
pitched
battles
he
proposed
that
the
allied
armies
should
remain
on
the
north
bank
of
the
tagus
adopt
a
good
defensive
position
and
defy
soult
to
attack
them
wellesley
would
not
listen
for
a
moment
to
this
project
and
finally
declared
that
in
spite
of
all
arguments
to
the
contrary
he
should
cross
the
tagus
that
day
at
the
head
of
his
army
the
two
generals
parted
in
wrath
and
at
six
o
clock
the
british
commenced
their
march
to
arzobispo
only
nine
miles
distant
the
whole
force
crossed
its
bridge
before
evening
and
established
itself
in
bivouac
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
as
usual
general
cuesta
wanted
to
fight
general
actions
writes
wellesley
to
beresford
from
arzobispo
on
the
afternoon
of
this
same
day
cuesta
remained
at
oropesa
for
the
whole
day
of
august
and
was
there
joined
both
by
bassecourt
who
had
fallen
back
from
centinello
and
by
zayas
and
albuquerque
who
had
evacuated
talavera
at
noon
and
made
a
forced
march
to
join
their
chief
he
appeared
disposed
to
fight
even
though
his
ally
had
abandoned
him
in
the
afternoon
mortier
s
cavalry
pressed
in
against
him
he
turned
fiercely
upon
them
deployed
a
whole
division
of
infantry
and
horse
in
their
front
and
drove
them
back
towards
their
supports
this
vigorous
action
had
a
result
that
could
not
have
been
foreseen
mortier
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
himself
about
to
be
attacked
by
the
whole
spanish
army
perhaps
by
wellesley
also
he
halted
the
corps
in
advance
of
navalmoral
and
wrote
to
implore
soult
to
come
up
to
his
aid
without
delay
the
duke
of
dalmatia
hurried
up
with
all
speed
and
on
august
brought
the
corps
to
casatejada
only
six
miles
in
the
rear
of
his
colleague
ney
following
with
a
like
promptness
advanced
that
day
to
malpartida
a
march
behind
the
position
of
soult
m
le
maréchal
duc
de
trévise
crut
qu
il
serait
attaqué
says
soult
in
his
report
of
august
he
therefore
held
back
and
sent
for
the
corps
hence
came
cuesta
s
salvation
on
the
sixth
therefore
the
whole
army
from
the
douro
was
practically
concentrated
and
soult
and
mortier
advanced
against
cuesta
with
ney
close
in
their
rear
they
found
that
they
were
too
late
after
remaining
in
battle
order
in
front
of
the
bridge
of
arzobispo
during
the
whole
of
the
fifth
courting
the
attack
which
mortier
had
been
too
cautious
to
deliver
the
had
crossed
the
tagus
that
night
and
had
occupied
its
further
bank
he
had
left
in
front
of
the
bridge
only
a
small
rearguard
which
retired
after
a
skirmish
with
the
advanced
cavalry
of
the
corps
for
once
cuesta
had
found
luck
upon
his
side
if
mortier
had
ventured
to
assail
him
on
the
fifth
and
had
forced
him
to
an
engagement
in
a
position
from
which
retreat
was
difficult
and
with
the
tagus
at
his
back
his
situation
would
have
been
most
perilous
for
even
if
he
had
kept
the
corps
at
bay
he
could
not
easily
have
withdrawn
in
face
of
it
and
soult
would
have
been
upon
him
on
the
next
morning
in
escaping
across
the
narrow
bridge
of
arzobispo
his
losses
must
have
been
terrible
indeed
the
greater
part
of
his
army
might
have
been
destroyed
finding
on
the
evening
of
august
that
both
the
british
and
the
estremaduran
armies
were
now
covered
by
the
tagus
whose
line
they
appeared
determined
to
defend
soult
was
forced
to
think
out
a
new
plan
of
campaign
his
original
design
of
taking
the
allies
in
the
rear
and
cutting
off
their
retreat
had
miscarried
he
must
now
either
halt
and
recognize
that
his
march
had
failed
in
its
main
purpose
or
else
deliver
a
frontal
attack
upon
the
line
of
the
tagus
the
bridge
of
almaraz
was
broken
and
troops
the
detachment
of
the
marquis
del
reino
were
visible
behind
it
the
bridge
of
arzobispo
was
not
destroyed
but
the
spaniards
were
obviously
ready
to
defend
it
it
was
barricaded
the
mediaeval
towers
in
its
midst
were
manned
by
a
detachment
of
infantry
and
a
battery
for
twelve
guns
had
been
placed
in
an
earthwork
erected
on
a
knoll
thirty
yards
in
its
rear
so
as
to
sweep
all
the
approaches
considerable
forces
both
of
cavalry
and
of
infantry
were
visible
on
the
hillsides
and
in
the
villages
of
the
southern
bank
cuesta
in
fact
while
proposing
to
fall
back
with
his
main
body
to
meza
de
ibor
and
deleytosa
in
order
to
recover
his
communication
with
his
base
at
badajoz
had
left
behind
a
strong
rearguard
consisting
of
bassecourt
s
infantry
division
and
albuquerque
s
six
regiments
of
cavalry
a
force
of
bayonets
and
nearly
sabres
they
were
ordered
to
defend
the
bridge
and
the
neighbouring
ford
of
azutan
till
further
orders
should
reach
them
the
ground
was
very
strong
indeed
the
ford
was
the
one
perilous
point
and
as
that
passage
was
narrow
and
hard
to
find
cuesta
trusted
that
it
might
be
maintained
even
against
very
superior
numbers
so
formidable
did
the
defence
appear
that
soult
halted
during
the
whole
day
of
august
while
he
took
stock
of
the
spanish
positions
and
sought
and
for
means
of
passage
other
than
the
bridge
he
was
not
at
first
aware
of
the
existence
of
the
ford
it
was
only
revealed
to
him
by
the
imprudence
of
the
spanish
cavalry
who
rode
their
horses
far
into
the
stream
when
watering
them
thus
showing
that
there
were
long
shallows
projecting
from
the
southern
bank
by
a
careful
search
at
night
the
french
discovered
that
the
river
was
only
deep
for
a
few
yards
under
their
own
bank
for
the
rest
of
its
breadth
there
were
only
two
or
three
feet
of
water
having
found
the
point
not
far
from
the
bridge
where
the
more
dangerous
part
of
the
channel
was
fordable
they
advised
the
marshal
that
the
passage
of
the
river
would
present
no
insurmountable
difficulties
soult
resolved
to
deliver
an
assault
both
on
the
bridge
and
on
the
ford
upon
the
morning
of
august
nor
was
it
only
at
arzobispo
that
he
determined
to
force
the
line
of
the
tagus
he
directed
ney
who
was
bringing
up
his
rear
at
the
head
of
the
corps
to
turn
aside
to
the
broken
bridge
of
almaraz
and
to
endeavour
to
cross
the
river
by
aid
of
a
ford
which
was
said
to
exist
in
that
neighbourhood
were
sent
to
the
marshal
in
order
to
enable
him
to
locate
the
exact
point
of
passage
it
would
seem
that
they
must
have
been
very
faulty
general
arteche
who
has
examined
the
ford
notes
that
the
main
channel
narrow
but
with
a
rocky
bottom
is
close
under
the
northern
the
french
bank
the
remaining
of
the
breadth
of
the
river
has
a
hard
sandy
bottom
and
is
in
august
extremely
shallow
if
once
therefore
the
deep
water
under
the
nearer
bank
was
crossed
the
french
had
no
difficulties
before
them
meanwhile
wellesley
had
passed
the
tagus
four
days
and
cuesta
three
days
before
the
marshal
s
attack
was
ready
and
both
had
been
granted
time
to
proceed
far
upon
their
way
it
was
fortunate
that
they
were
not
hurried
for
the
road
from
arzobispo
to
meza
de
ibor
and
thence
to
deleytosa
and
jaraicejo
though
passable
for
guns
and
wheeled
vehicles
was
steep
and
in
a
deplorable
condition
of
disrepair
it
took
wellesley
two
days
to
march
from
the
bridge
to
meza
de
ibor
a
distance
of
only
seventeen
miles
because
of
the
endless
trouble
caused
by
his
artillery
there
were
places
where
he
had
practically
to
remake
the
roadway
and
others
where
whole
companies
of
infantry
had
to
be
turned
on
to
haul
the
cannon
up
slopes
where
the
horses
could
make
no
headway
these
exertions
were
all
the
more
exhausting
because
the
men
were
falling
into
a
state
of
great
bodily
weakness
from
insufficient
supplies
even
at
talavera
they
had
on
many
days
received
no
more
than
half
rations
but
after
passing
oropesa
regular
distributions
of
food
ceased
altogether
for
some
time
there
were
still
a
few
with
the
army
but
bread
or
biscuit
was
unobtainable
and
the
troops
had
to
maintain
themselves
on
what
they
could
scrape
up
from
the
thinly
peopled
and
rugged
a
diet
of
overripe
parched
to
the
hardness
of
bullets
was
all
that
many
could
obtain
better
foragers
eked
them
out
with
honeycomb
stolen
from
the
peasants
hives
and
pork
got
by
shooting
the
pigs
which
roam
in
troops
among
the
woods
on
the
mountain
side
many
in
the
ravenous
eagerness
of
hunger
ate
the
meat
warm
and
raw
and
contracted
choleraic
complaints
from
their
unwholesome
feeding
for
details
of
these
privations
see
the
diary
of
leach
of
the
divining
that
soult
would
probably
make
a
dash
at
almaraz
as
well
as
at
arzobispo
wellesley
sent
on
ahead
of
his
main
body
the
brigade
of
robert
craufurd
to
which
he
attached
donkin
s
much
depleted
regiments
in
order
to
make
up
a
small
division
as
they
were
unhampered
by
guns
or
baggage
this
detachment
reached
almaraz
on
the
sixth
after
a
fifteen
hours
forced
march
on
the
preceding
day
they
took
over
charge
of
the
broken
bridge
and
the
ford
from
the
spanish
troops
of
the
marquis
del
reino
and
proceeded
to
entrench
themselves
in
the
excellent
positions
overlooking
the
point
where
the
river
was
passable
thus
ney
when
he
reached
almaraz
on
the
following
day
found
the
enemy
already
established
opposite
him
and
ready
to
dispute
the
crossing
about
british
troops
and
spanish
troops
were
holding
the
river
bank
immediately
at
their
backs
was
the
narrow
and
eminently
defensible
defile
of
mirabete
which
completely
commands
the
road
to
truxillo
it
was
an
even
stronger
position
than
that
which
covered
the
ford
and
the
ruined
bridge
on
august
therefore
wellesley
considered
himself
in
a
comparatively
satisfactory
situation
the
passage
at
almaraz
was
held
by
a
vanguard
consisting
of
the
best
troops
in
the
army
two
divisions
the
cavalry
and
all
the
guns
had
traversed
the
worst
part
of
the
road
and
had
reached
deleytosa
only
nine
miles
behind
craufurd
s
position
if
the
french
should
attack
on
the
following
day
the
main
body
could
reinforce
the
light
brigade
in
a
few
hours
one
division
in
the
rear
was
holding
the
position
of
meza
de
ibor
which
wellesley
did
not
wish
to
evacuate
until
the
spanish
army
was
ready
to
occupy
it
he
had
discovered
that
there
were
points
between
arzobispo
and
almaraz
where
the
passage
of
the
tagus
was
not
wholly
impracticable
for
small
bodies
of
infantry
and
dreaded
that
the
enemy
might
throw
a
detachment
across
the
stream
to
make
a
dash
for
the
meza
if
this
position
had
been
lost
the
communication
between
the
two
armies
would
have
been
broken
wellesley
to
o
donoju
from
deleytosa
cuesta
meanwhile
was
engaged
in
the
steep
and
stony
mountain
road
over
which
wellesley
had
toiled
on
the
and
the
of
august
his
vanguard
was
now
close
to
meza
de
ibor
the
rest
of
the
army
was
strung
out
between
that
point
and
val
de
la
casa
the
himself
had
his
head
quarters
on
the
night
of
the
seventh
at
peraleda
de
garbin
ten
miles
west
of
arzobispo
bassecourt
and
albuquerque
were
still
covering
the
rear
with
mortier
s
corps
now
plainly
visible
in
their
front
on
their
steadiness
depended
the
safety
of
the
whole
army
for
cuesta
had
more
baggage
and
more
guns
than
wellesley
and
therefore
the
road
over
the
hills
was
even
more
trying
to
him
than
to
his
colleague
there
was
a
congestion
of
wheeled
transport
at
certain
spots
on
the
road
which
created
hopeless
confusion
and
barred
the
march
of
the
cavalry
and
even
of
the
infantry
divisions
it
was
only
removed
by
setting
whole
battalions
to
work
to
drag
the
wagons
out
of
the
way
cuesta
s
ultimate
destination
was
the
meza
de
ibor
a
position
of
unparalleled
strength
which
could
be
held
even
after
the
enemy
had
crossed
the
tagus
that
they
would
ultimately
win
their
way
over
the
river
was
certain
for
already
news
had
arrived
that
victor
after
reaching
talavera
on
had
pushed
infantry
over
its
bridge
on
the
road
to
herencia
and
aldea
nueva
troops
coming
from
this
direction
would
outflank
the
arzobispo
position
and
compel
albuquerque
to
abandon
it
even
without
cavalry
or
guns
this
detachment
of
the
corps
would
be
strong
enough
to
dislodge
the
guard
of
the
bridge
by
falling
upon
its
rear
while
mortier
was
attacking
it
in
front
as
the
cavalry
of
victor
and
soult
had
met
half
way
between
oropesa
and
talavera
upon
the
afternoon
of
the
seventh
the
two
marshals
were
now
in
full
communication
and
able
to
concert
any
plans
that
they
might
please
for
joint
operations
beside
his
own
thirty
guns
he
had
the
seventeen
captured
french
pieces
which
had
been
won
at
talavera
wellesley
it
will
be
remembered
had
handed
them
over
to
him
the
duke
of
dalmatia
however
preferred
to
win
all
the
credit
for
himself
and
attacked
without
allowing
his
colleague
s
troops
time
to
approach
the
spanish
position
it
was
fortunate
for
albuquerque
that
the
rivalry
of
the
two
hostile
commanders
saved
him
from
the
joint
assault
which
would
have
been
far
more
ruinous
to
him
than
the
actual
combat
of
was
destined
to
prove
having
full
knowledge
of
the
existence
and
the
locality
of
the
ford
of
azutan
soult
had
resolved
to
launch
his
main
attack
upon
this
point
while
directing
only
a
subsidiary
attack
upon
the
fortified
bridge
this
last
was
only
to
be
pushed
home
in
case
the
troops
sent
against
the
ford
should
succeed
in
making
good
their
footing
upon
the
further
bank
a
careful
observation
of
the
spanish
lines
showed
that
both
albuquerque
and
bassecourt
were
holding
back
the
main
body
of
their
divisions
at
some
distance
from
the
water
s
edge
in
the
groves
around
the
three
villages
of
pedrosa
burgillo
and
azutan
there
was
only
a
single
regiment
of
cavalry
watching
the
river
bank
and
two
or
three
battalions
of
infantry
manning
the
towers
of
the
bridge
of
arzobispo
and
the
redoubt
in
its
rear
the
spaniards
showed
every
sign
of
a
blind
confidence
in
the
strength
of
their
position
behind
the
broad
but
shallow
tagus
knowing
their
habits
soult
selected
for
the
moment
of
his
attack
the
hour
of
the
it
was
between
one
and
two
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
when
he
bade
his
columns
which
had
been
drawn
up
under
cover
and
at
some
distance
from
the
water
s
edge
to
advance
to
force
the
passage
for
the
assault
upon
the
ford
he
had
collected
the
whole
of
his
cavalry
no
less
than
twelve
regiments
lahoussaye
s
dragoons
formed
the
van
then
came
lorges
brigade
then
the
division
of
light
horse
belonging
to
the
corps
in
the
rear
the
of
mortier
this
mass
of
horsemen
was
to
be
followed
by
the
first
brigade
of
girard
s
infantry
division
of
the
corps
while
its
second
brigade
was
to
assault
the
bridge
when
lahoussaye
and
lorges
should
have
won
the
passage
of
the
ford
and
have
established
themselves
on
the
flank
of
the
spanish
defences
gazan
s
division
the
second
of
the
corps
was
to
support
girard
while
the
masses
of
the
infantry
of
the
corps
remained
in
reserve
all
the
light
artillery
of
the
army
was
to
gallop
down
to
the
water
s
edge
at
various
selected
points
when
the
attacking
columns
were
first
put
in
movement
and
to
distract
the
attention
of
the
enemy
s
guns
so
far
as
lay
in
their
power
at
about
caulaincourt
s
brigade
of
lahoussaye
s
dragoons
a
force
of
about
sabres
sallied
out
from
its
cover
behind
the
village
of
arzobispo
and
moved
down
to
the
ford
at
a
sharp
trot
it
plunged
into
the
water
had
passed
the
deeper
part
of
the
channel
almost
before
the
spaniards
had
guessed
its
intention
and
soon
reached
the
shallows
on
the
opposite
bank
the
only
hostile
force
ready
to
meet
it
was
a
single
regiment
the
estremaduran
hussars
which
was
watching
the
ford
and
a
battalion
of
infantry
which
bassecourt
sent
down
in
haste
from
the
redoubt
behind
the
bridge
a
fierce
charge
of
caulaincourt
s
dragoons
dispersed
and
routed
the
spanish
horse
after
they
had
been
driven
off
the
victors
turned
upon
the
battalion
which
tried
to
form
square
on
their
approach
but
was
late
in
finishing
its
manœuvre
it
was
assailed
before
the
rear
side
had
been
formed
broken
up
and
cut
to
pieces
soult
had
thus
gained
a
precious
during
which
the
remainder
of
his
cavalry
squadron
after
squadron
came
pouring
over
the
ford
and
began
to
form
up
on
the
southern
bank
when
several
regiments
had
passed
he
also
let
loose
the
infantry
brigade
which
was
to
attack
the
bridge
so
narrow
was
the
approach
that
only
a
single
battalion
the
of
the
of
the
line
could
deliver
the
assault
but
the
companies
of
several
other
battalions
and
two
batteries
of
horse
artillery
opened
a
lateral
fire
from
various
points
of
the
northern
bank
to
distract
the
spaniards
from
the
frontal
attack
the
fraction
of
bassecourt
s
division
which
was
in
position
at
the
bridge
and
the
redoubt
had
already
been
completely
cowed
by
seeing
lahoussaye
s
cavalry
forming
up
in
their
flank
and
rear
if
they
waited
to
resist
the
infantry
attack
it
was
clear
that
they
would
be
cut
off
from
their
sole
line
of
retreat
by
the
dragoons
they
abandoned
their
positions
after
firing
a
couple
of
scattering
volleys
and
fled
eastward
along
the
river
bank
towards
the
village
of
azutan
the
heavy
guns
in
the
redoubt
were
left
behind
and
fell
into
the
hands
of
caulaincourt
girard
s
infantry
was
therefore
able
to
cross
the
river
almost
without
loss
two
regiments
at
the
bridge
two
at
the
ford
which
the
cavalry
had
already
utilized
a
few
men
were
drowned
in
the
second
column
having
strayed
into
deep
water
by
swerving
to
the
right
or
left
of
the
proper
route
meanwhile
albuquerque
s
horse
and
bassecourt
s
second
brigade
roused
from
their
siesta
were
pouring
out
of
the
villages
which
had
sheltered
them
from
the
noontide
heat
the
infantry
four
battalions
apparently
drew
up
beside
a
wood
on
the
slope
a
mile
above
the
bridge
and
waited
to
be
attacked
the
cavalry
however
came
on
in
one
great
mass
and
charged
down
upon
lahoussaye
s
division
which
was
covering
the
deployment
of
the
rest
of
the
french
horse
albuquerque
s
only
thought
was
to
engage
the
enemy
before
he
had
succeeded
in
passing
the
whole
of
his
squadrons
over
the
ford
vainly
hoping
to
atone
for
his
previous
slackness
by
haste
that
came
too
late
he
had
hurried
his
five
regiments
forward
as
soon
as
the
men
could
saddle
and
bridle
their
horses
fractions
of
the
different
corps
were
mixed
together
and
no
proper
first
or
second
line
had
been
formed
the
whole
mass
some
sabres
in
great
disorder
galloped
down
upon
the
two
brigades
of
lahoussaye
and
engaged
them
for
a
short
time
but
lorges
dragoons
and
part
of
soult
s
light
horse
were
now
at
hand
to
aid
the
leading
division
the
spaniards
were
beset
in
flank
as
well
as
in
front
and
broke
after
the
first
shock
albuquerque
who
showed
plenty
of
useless
personal
courage
tried
in
vain
to
rally
them
on
the
estremaduran
hussars
the
only
regiment
which
remained
intact
it
was
borne
away
by
the
backrush
of
the
rest
and
scattering
over
the
hillsides
the
whole
body
fled
westward
and
northward
some
towards
peraleda
de
garbin
others
towards
pedrosa
bassecourt
s
infantry
went
off
to
the
rear
as
soon
as
they
saw
their
comrades
routed
and
took
to
the
hills
by
keeping
to
rocky
ground
they
suffered
comparatively
little
loss
the
french
urged
the
pursuit
of
albuquerque
s
fugitive
horsemen
for
many
miles
chasing
them
as
far
as
the
defile
of
la
estrella
in
the
sierra
de
guadalupe
in
one
direction
and
beyond
val
de
la
casa
in
the
other
on
the
latter
road
the
chase
only
ceased
when
the
dragoons
came
upon
the
divisions
of
henestrosa
and
zayas
from
cuesta
s
main
army
drawn
up
across
their
path
the
losses
of
the
spaniards
were
very
considerable
men
and
horses
were
captured
and
over
killed
and
wounded
one
flag
was
taken
that
of
the
regiment
cut
to
pieces
by
lahoussaye
s
dragoons
at
the
commencement
of
the
fighting
the
pieces
in
the
redoubt
and
the
divisional
battery
of
albuquerque
guns
in
all
were
lost
by
an
additional
mischance
the
french
also
recovered
fourteen
of
their
own
seventeen
guns
that
had
been
taken
at
talavera
cuesta
had
not
been
able
to
utilize
these
pieces
for
want
of
gunners
they
were
trailing
along
in
the
rear
of
his
army
very
indifferently
horsed
when
the
french
dragoons
swept
along
the
road
to
peraleda
on
the
approach
of
the
pursuers
they
were
abandoned
by
the
wayside
this
capture
enabled
soult
to
assert
that
he
had
taken
in
all
cannon
and
emboldened
sebastiani
a
few
weeks
later
to
declare
that
he
had
never
lost
his
guns
at
talavera
having
recovered
them
he
could
exhibit
them
all
save
two
or
three
in
evidence
of
his
mendacious
statement
the
fact
that
these
guns
were
actually
french
explains
le
noble
s
statement
that
the
captured
pieces
were
largely
de
modèle
napier
has
a
strange
statement
whose
source
i
can
not
discover
to
the
effect
that
cuesta
on
his
march
to
meza
d
ibor
left
fifteen
guns
upon
the
road
which
albuquerque
s
flight
uncovered
a
trumpeter
attending
an
english
flag
of
truce
treacherously
or
foolishly
made
known
the
fact
to
the
french
who
immediately
sent
cavalry
to
fetch
them
napier
ii
soult
declared
in
his
official
report
that
his
cavalry
had
lost
only
killed
and
wounded
his
artillery
wounded
his
infantry
hardly
a
man
save
some
few
drowned
at
the
ford
the
rout
of
the
spanish
rearguard
and
the
capture
of
the
bridge
of
arzobispo
gave
soult
a
foothold
on
the
southern
bank
of
the
tagus
but
little
more
the
road
by
which
he
could
now
advance
against
the
allies
was
detestable
we
have
already
seen
how
its
cliffs
and
ravines
had
tried
the
british
and
the
estremaduran
armies
to
reach
cuesta
s
new
position
on
the
meza
de
ibor
the
duke
of
dalmatia
would
have
had
to
make
a
two
days
march
through
these
defiles
dragging
his
guns
with
him
his
cavalry
he
would
have
been
forced
to
leave
behind
him
as
there
would
have
been
no
means
of
employing
it
in
the
mountains
meanwhile
wellesley
had
established
himself
in
the
ground
which
he
had
selected
behind
the
broken
bridge
of
almaraz
and
cuesta
had
got
the
whole
of
his
infantry
and
half
his
artillery
over
the
ibor
stream
and
arrayed
them
on
the
meza
where
the
rocky
slopes
are
impregnable
against
a
frontal
attack
if
the
defending
army
shows
ordinary
determination
all
through
the
ninth
and
the
morning
of
the
tenth
the
spaniards
were
dragging
the
rest
of
their
guns
and
their
baggage
up
the
steep
zigzag
path
between
the
river
and
the
summit
of
the
plateau
and
it
was
not
till
the
end
of
the
latter
day
that
everything
was
in
position
it
is
probable
therefore
that
if
soult
had
pressed
his
pursuit
with
all
possible
speed
he
might
have
captured
some
of
the
spanish
on
the
morning
of
the
tenth
but
there
were
defiles
between
peraleda
and
the
ibor
river
where
cuesta
s
rearguard
might
possibly
have
detained
him
till
the
guns
and
baggage
were
in
safety
it
will
he
remembered
that
on
march
victor
turned
del
parque
s
division
out
of
the
meza
de
ibor
position
but
the
latter
had
only
men
not
enough
to
man
the
whole
line
while
the
duke
of
belluno
had
two
divisions
for
the
frontal
attack
and
turned
the
meza
with
another
that
of
villatte
cuesta
had
men
and
more
quite
sufficient
to
hold
the
entire
position
wellesley
went
to
visit
his
allies
on
the
meza
upon
the
morning
of
and
found
that
half
the
guns
and
baggage
had
been
dragged
up
on
the
ninth
but
that
there
was
still
a
great
accumulation
at
the
foot
of
the
steep
slope
between
the
ibor
river
and
the
lower
edge
of
the
plateau
he
was
in
great
distress
at
the
notion
that
the
french
might
come
up
at
any
moment
drive
in
the
rearguard
and
capture
the
rear
sections
of
the
spanish
train
see
to
lord
wellesley
from
deleytosa
the
duke
of
dalmatia
however
paused
at
the
bridge
of
arzobispo
before
committing
himself
to
a
second
advance
against
the
allies
he
was
averse
to
making
an
isolated
attack
upon
the
admirable
position
now
occupied
by
the
estremaduran
army
and
wished
to
combine
it
with
a
simultaneous
assault
upon
the
british
it
will
be
remembered
that
he
had
detached
ney
s
corps
from
the
rear
of
his
line
of
march
and
ordered
it
to
attempt
the
passage
of
the
tagus
at
almaraz
by
the
ford
which
he
knew
to
exist
close
to
the
ruined
bridge
he
also
wrote
to
victor
to
desire
him
to
push
forward
the
two
infantry
divisions
which
had
crossed
the
river
at
talavera
and
to
direct
them
on
mohedas
and
alia
so
as
to
turn
cuesta
s
flank
by
a
long
circuitous
march
among
the
rugged
summits
of
the
sierra
de
guadalupe
neither
of
these
subsidiary
movements
was
carried
out
one
division
of
ney
s
corps
and
fournier
s
brigade
of
dragoons
reached
almaraz
on
the
other
division
and
the
light
cavalry
had
followed
the
corps
so
closely
that
it
had
passed
navalmoral
on
its
way
eastward
and
had
to
make
a
long
it
was
not
till
the
ninth
or
tenth
therefore
that
the
duke
of
elchingen
would
have
been
in
a
position
to
attempt
the
passage
of
the
tagus
craufurd
s
detachment
had
been
established
at
mirabete
behind
the
broken
bridge
since
and
two
days
later
the
main
body
of
the
british
army
had
reached
deleytosa
where
it
was
within
a
few
hours
march
of
the
vanguard
and
perfectly
ready
to
support
it
if
ney
had
endeavoured
to
pass
the
tagus
on
the
ninth
or
tenth
with
his
men
it
is
clear
that
the
head
of
his
column
must
have
been
destroyed
for
the
ford
was
narrow
and
difficult
and
indeed
barely
passable
for
infantry
even
in
the
middle
of
august
but
the
marshal
did
not
even
attempt
the
passage
for
the
simple
reason
that
his
intelligence
officers
failed
to
discover
the
ford
and
reported
to
him
that
none
existed
he
sent
word
to
soult
that
the
scheme
was
impracticable
and
drawing
back
from
the
water
s
edge
concentrated
his
whole
corps
at
navalmoral
from
soult
s
dispatch
of
it
appears
that
a
colonel
ornano
with
a
regiment
of
dragoons
was
detailed
to
examine
the
banks
of
the
tagus
in
search
of
the
ford
but
failed
to
find
it
the
cause
is
not
hard
to
seek
for
it
crosses
the
river
diagonally
on
a
narrow
shelf
of
rock
with
deep
water
on
either
side
it
is
not
less
than
four
feet
deep
and
leach
of
the
who
was
on
guard
at
its
southern
end
describes
it
as
not
exactly
practicable
for
infantry
even
at
the
driest
season
of
the
year
the
english
knowing
its
exact
course
were
established
in
positions
from
which
they
could
concentrate
upon
it
in
a
few
minutes
we
may
rationally
suppose
therefore
that
ney
would
have
found
the
tagus
not
less
difficult
to
pass
on
than
the
oitaben
had
been
on
june
victor
at
the
other
end
of
the
french
line
showed
no
desire
to
adventure
his
infantry
among
the
defiles
of
the
sierra
de
guadalupe
without
guns
or
cavalry
and
refused
to
move
up
into
the
mountains
in
order
to
turn
cuesta
s
right
flank
thus
the
whole
plan
concerted
by
the
duke
of
dalmatia
for
a
general
attack
on
the
allies
came
to
an
ignominious
conclusion
it
would
appear
indeed
that
his
chance
of
inflicting
a
serious
blow
on
the
enemy
had
passed
away
long
ere
he
brought
the
and
corps
down
to
the
bridge
of
arzobispo
it
was
on
the
fifth
when
mortier
refused
to
close
with
cuesta
and
allowed
him
to
withdraw
across
the
tagus
that
soult
had
lost
his
best
opportunity
on
that
day
the
spaniards
were
still
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
river
and
the
british
vanguard
had
not
yet
reached
the
broken
bridge
of
almaraz
if
mortier
had
engaged
the
army
of
cuesta
and
ney
had
found
and
attacked
the
ford
at
almaraz
before
craufurd
s
arrival
the
position
of
the
allies
would
have
been
forlorn
indeed
but
on
the
fifth
soult
had
not
yet
discovered
the
real
position
of
affairs
and
the
head
of
ney
s
corps
was
only
just
debouching
from
plasencia
two
long
marches
from
almaraz
in
short
the
fog
of
war
as
a
modern
writer
has
happily
called
it
was
still
lying
thick
about
the
combatants
and
soult
s
best
chance
was
gone
before
he
was
even
aware
of
it
on
august
matters
looked
far
less
promising
even
though
the
bridge
of
arzobispo
had
been
won
since
ney
sent
word
that
he
could
not
cross
at
almaraz
while
victor
declined
to
commit
himself
to
any
schemes
for
an
advance
into
the
eastern
mountains
soult
saw
that
he
must
construct
another
scheme
of
operations
his
own
preference
was
for
a
march
into
portugal
by
way
of
coria
and
castello
branco
such
an
attack
upon
wellesley
s
base
made
by
the
men
of
the
and
corps
would
compel
the
british
to
abandon
almaraz
to
give
up
their
connexion
with
cuesta
and
to
march
in
haste
by
truxillo
caceres
and
portalegre
on
abrantes
in
order
to
cover
lisbon
it
was
even
possible
that
if
the
invading
army
made
great
haste
it
might
reach
abrantes
before
the
british
in
that
case
wellesley
would
be
forced
to
keep
to
the
southern
bank
of
the
tagus
and
cross
it
at
santarem
comparatively
close
to
the
capital
thus
all
central
portugal
might
be
won
without
a
battle
and
lisbon
itself
might
fall
ere
the
campaign
ended
since
the
men
of
the
british
general
even
when
aided
by
the
local
levies
could
not
as
soult
supposed
hold
back
three
french
d
there
was
another
alternative
possible
to
march
not
on
lisbon
but
on
ciudad
rodrigo
and
almeida
and
to
invade
portugal
by
the
northern
road
but
this
plan
would
take
a
longer
time
to
execute
and
promised
less
decisive
results
soult
to
joseph
from
arzobispo

but
even
before
the
combat
of
arzobispo
had
taken
place
joseph
and
jourdan
had
determined
that
they
would
not
permit
soult
to
carry
out
any
schemes
of
advance
against
portugal
they
could
show
very
good
grounds
for
their
decision
if
the
duke
of
dalmatia
marched
off
to
attack
lisbon
he
would
leave
the
and
corps
and
the
king
s
reserve
less
than
men
in
all
after
the
losses
of
talavera
opposed
to
cuesta
wellesley
and
venegas
who
between
them
would
have
at
least
if
the
british
army
should
refuse
to
be
drawn
away
towards
portugal
and
should
recross
the
tagus
at
almaraz
with
cuesta
in
its
wake
the
situation
would
be
deplorable
victor
would
be
exposed
just
as
he
had
been
on
july
and
to
a
joint
attack
from
the
two
armies
and
on
this
occasion
sebastiani
and
the
king
would
not
be
able
to
bring
him
help
for
they
were
now
closely
engaged
with
venegas
near
aranjuez
if
they
moved
away
from
the
front
of
the
army
of
la
mancha
madrid
would
be
lost
in
two
days
if
they
did
not
so
move
wellesley
and
cuesta
might
crush
victor
or
drive
him
away
on
some
eccentric
line
of
retreat
which
would
uncover
the
capital
jourdan
therefore
writing
in
the
name
of
joseph
had
informed
soult
in
a
dispatch
dated
that
it
was
impossible
to
permit
him
to
march
on
portugal
as
his
departure
would
uncover
madrid
and
probably
bring
about
a
fatal
disaster
he
also
urged
that
the
exhaustion
of
the
troops
rendered
a
halt
necessary
and
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
feed
them
if
they
advanced
into
the
stony
wilderness
on
the
borders
of
portugal
before
they
had
collected
magazines
for
the
present
the
king
would
be
contented
to
keep
the
allies
in
check
without
seeking
to
attack
or
disperse
them
until
the
weather
began
to
grow
cooler
and
the
troops
had
rested
from
their
fatigues
joseph
exaggerating
the
enemy
s
force
was
under
the
impression
that
they
had
fully
men
see
his
letter
to
napoleon
of
july
illustration
the
campaign
of
talavera
as
if
intending
to
put
it
out
of
soult
s
power
to
undertake
his
projected
expedition
into
portugal
jourdan
and
joseph
now
proceeded
to
deprive
him
of
the
control
of
one
of
his
three
army
corps
they
authorized
ney
to
recross
the
mountains
and
to
return
to
salamanca
in
order
to
protect
the
plains
of
leon
from
the
incursions
of
the
spaniards
of
galicia
deprived
of
such
a
large
section
of
his
army
soult
would
be
unable
to
march
against
abrantes
as
he
so
much
desired
to
do
there
were
good
military
reasons
too
for
sending
off
ney
in
this
direction
kellermann
kept
reporting
that
la
romana
was
on
the
move
and
that
unless
promptly
succoured
he
should
find
himself
obliged
to
abandon
benavente
and
zamora
and
to
fall
back
on
valladolid
the
spaniards
from
ciudad
rodrigo
had
already
taken
the
offensive
and
del
parque
s
advanced
guard
had
even
seized
salamanca
ney
accepted
with
alacrity
the
chance
of
withdrawing
himself
from
the
immediate
control
of
his
old
enemy
soult
he
received
his
permission
to
return
to
leon
on
on
the
tenth
his
whole
corps
was
on
the
move
and
on
the
eleventh
he
had
retired
to
plasencia
on
the
following
day
he
plunged
into
the
passes
and
made
for
salamanca
with
all
possible
speed
ney
has
been
accused
of
deserting
soult
and
retiring
from
almaraz
and
navalmoral
on
his
own
responsibility
and
contrary
to
the
orders
of
his
immediate
superior
but
jourdan
s
dispatch
of
to
the
minister
of
war
shows
that
the
duke
of
elchingen
was
obeying
directions
sent
to
him
from
the
royal
head
quarters
le
roi
a
pensé
he
writes
qu
on
ne
devait
pas
quant
à
présent
chercher
à
pénétrer

en

en

le
duc
de

le
corps
sur
salamanque
pour
en
chasser
les
ennemis
et
couvrir
la
vieille
castille
conjointement
avec
le
général
ney
then
was
strictly
correct
in
stating
in
his
dispatch
of
that
he
had
acted
in
obedience
to
his
orders
while
the
corps
was
dispatched
to
the
north
the
king
directed
soult
to
take
up
with
the
rest
of
his
troops
a
defensive
position
opposite
the
allied
armies
on
the
central
tagus
the
corps
was
to
occupy
plasencia
the
to
watch
the
passages
at
almaraz
and
arzobispo
while
keeping
a
detachment
at
talavera
thus
all
soult
s
plans
for
an
active
campaign
were
shattered
and
he
was
told
off
to
act
as
a
containing
meanwhile
joseph
drew
victor
and
the
corps
away
from
talavera
towards
toledo
and
la
mancha
with
the
intention
of
bringing
them
into
play
against
venegas
for
just
as
soult
had
always
an
eye
on
portugal
so
joseph
had
always
an
eye
on
he
could
not
feel
secure
so
long
as
a
spanish
army
lay
near
toledo
or
aranjuez
only
two
marches
from
the
gates
of
his
capital
and
was
determined
to
dislodge
it
from
this
threatening
position
before
taking
any
other
operation
in
hand
he
had
accepted
as
true
rumours
to
the
effect
that
part
of
cuesta
s
troops
had
retired
in
the
direction
of
ocaña
to
join
the
army
of
la
mancha
and
even
that
british
had
been
detached
in
this
same
direction
thus
he
had
persuaded
himself
that
venegas
had
men
and
was
desirous
of
drawing
in
victor
to
his
head
quarters
before
delivering
his
attack
thinking
that
sebastiani
and
the
central
reserve
would
be
too
weak
for
the
task

napoleon

section

chapter
ix
the
end
of
the
talavera
campaign
almonacid
while
king
joseph
s
orders
were
being
carried
out
wellesley
and
cuesta
found
themselves
to
their
great
surprise
unmolested
by
any
hostile
force
the
army
which
had
been
in
their
front
at
almaraz
and
arzobispo
disappeared
on
august
leaving
only
small
detachments
to
watch
the
northern
bank
of
the
tagus
it
was
soon
reported
to
wellesley
that
victor
had
passed
away
towards
toledo
and
that
another
corps
or
perhaps
two
had
retired
to
plasencia
the
object
of
this
move
however
had
to
be
determined
before
the
british
general
could
take
corresponding
measures
was
soult
about
to
invade
portugal
by
way
of
coria
and
castello
branco
or
was
he
merely
taking
up
cantonments
from
which
he
could
observe
the
british
and
estremaduran
armies
while
the
king
and
victor
moved
off
against
venegas
on
the
whole
wellesley
was
inclined
to
believe
that
the
latter
hypothesis
was
the
correct
one
and
that
the
enemy
was
about
to
refuse
his
right
wing
and
to
use
his
left
for
offensive
action
against
the
army
of
la
mancha
as
was
generally
the
case
his
prescience
was
not
at
fault
and
he
had
exactly
divined
the
king
s
intentions
he
had
nevertheless
to
guard
against
the
possibility
that
the
other
alternative
might
prove
to
be
correct
and
that
central
portugal
was
in
danger
as
indeed
it
would
have
been
if
joseph
had
allowed
soult
to
carry
out
his
original
plan
see
wellesley
s
letter
of
to
beresford
concerning
the
departure
of
the
french
robert
craufurd
estimated
the
force
that
had
marched
on
plasencia
at
men
donkin
at
if
the
latter
had
judged
the
numbers
correctly
wellesley
supposed
that
both
ney
and
soult
must
have
gone
by
this
road
this
was
actually
the
case
wellesley
to
villiers
the
french
having
been
moving
since
the
ninth
towards
plasencia
i
can
form
no
decided
opinion
respecting
their
intentions
i
think
however
that
if
they
meditated
a
serious
attack
on
portugal
they
would
not
have
moved
off
in
daylight
in
full
sight
of
our
troops
i
suspect
these
movements
are
intended
only
as
a
feint
to
induce
us
to
separate
ourselves
from
the
spaniards
in
order
to
cover
wellesley
resolved
therefore
to
maintain
his
present
position
at
jaraicejo
and
mirabete
till
he
should
be
certain
as
to
the
intentions
of
the
french
if
they
were
really
about
to
invade
portugal
he
would
march
at
once
for
abrantes
if
not
he
would
keep
his
ground
for
by
holding
the
passage
at
almaraz
he
was
threatening
the
french
centre
and
detaining
in
his
front
troops
who
would
otherwise
be
free
to
attack
the
spaniards
either
in
la
mancha
or
in
leon
meanwhile
measures
had
to
be
taken
to
provide
a
detaining
force
in
front
of
soult
lest
an
attack
on
portugal
should
turn
out
to
be
in
progress
this
force
was
provided
by
bringing
down
beresford
and
the
portuguese
field
army
to
zarza
and
alcantara
and
sending
up
to
their
aid
the
british
reinforcements
which
had
landed
at
lisbon
during
the
month
of
july
beresford
it
will
be
remembered
had
received
orders
at
the
commencement
of
the
campaign
directing
him
to
concentrate
his
army
behind
almeida
to
link
his
operations
with
those
of
del
parque
and
the
spanish
force
at
ciudad
rodrigo
but
at
the
same
time
to
be
ready
to
transfer
himself
either
northward
or
southward
if
his
presence
should
be
required
on
the
douro
or
the
tagus
in
accordance
with
these
instructions
beresford
had
collected
battalions
of
regular
infantry
with
one
more
from
the
lusitanian
legion
and
the
university
volunteers
of
coimbra
as
also
five
squadrons
from
various
cavalry
regiments
and
four
batteries
of
artillery
a
force
of
men
in
all
on
july
he
had
crossed
the
spanish
frontier
and
lay
at
san
felices
and
villa
de
cervo
near
ciudad
rodrigo
there
he
heard
of
soult
s
march
from
salamanca
towards
plasencia
and
very
properly
made
up
his
mind
to
bring
his
army
down
to
estremadura
by
a
line
parallel
to
that
which
the
french
had
taken
he
crossed
the
sierra
de
gata
by
the
rough
pass
of
perales
and
on
august
fixed
his
head
quarters
at
moraleja
near
coria
on
the
southern
slope
of
the
mountains
his
cavalry
held
coria
while
his
right
wing
was
in
touch
with
the
english
brigades
from
lisbon
which
had
just
reached
zarza
la
mayor
these
were
the
seven
battalions
of
lightburne
and
catlin
craufurd
which
wellesley
had
vainly
hoped
to
receive
in
time
for
talavera
they
numbered
bayonets
and
had
with
them
one
battery
of
british
artillery
these
regiments
were
line
infantry
nos
all
save
no
two
battalions
strong
and
the
and
cazadores
with
no
of
the
lusitanian
legion
and
the
voluntarios
académicos
of
coimbra
viz
thus
even
before
soult
reached
plasencia
there
was
an
army
of
portuguese
and
british
on
the
lower
tietar
ready
to
act
as
a
detaining
force
and
to
retard
the
marshal
s
advance
if
he
should
make
a
serious
attempt
to
invade
portugal
on
by
wellesley
s
orders
beresford
left
moraleja
and
transferred
his
whole
army
to
zarza
in
order
to
be
able
to
fall
back
with
perfect
security
on
castello
branco
should
circumstances
so
require
if
he
had
remained
at
moraleja
he
might
have
been
cut
off
from
the
to
abrantes
by
a
sudden
movement
of
the
enemy
on
coria
see
wellesley
to
beresford
wellesley
now
felt
comparatively
safe
so
far
as
matters
strategical
were
concerned
if
the
enemy
contrary
to
his
expectation
should
march
into
portugal
he
could
join
beresford
at
abrantes
and
stand
at
bay
with
some
british
and
portuguese
regulars
a
force
sufficient
to
check
the
men
who
was
the
utmost
force
that
soult
could
bring
against
him
after
ney
s
departure
meanwhile
till
the
marshal
should
move
he
retained
his
old
position
at
mirabete
and
jaraicejo
though
the
french
showed
no
signs
of
activity
in
his
front
the
weary
fortnight
during
which
the
british
army
lay
in
position
behind
the
tagus
were
perhaps
the
most
trying
time
that
wellesley
spent
during
his
first
campaign
in
spain
it
was
a
period
of
absolute
starvation
for
man
and
beast
and
the
army
was
going
to
pieces
under
his
eyes
ever
since
the
british
had
arrived
in
front
of
talavera
on
july
rations
as
we
have
already
seen
had
been
scanty
and
irregular
but
the
fourteen
days
spent
at
deleytosa
and
jaraicejo
were
even
worse
than
those
which
had
preceded
them
the
stores
collected
at
plasencia
had
been
captured
by
the
french
those
gathered
at
abrantes
were
so
far
distant
that
they
could
not
be
drawn
upon
now
that
the
north
of
the
tagus
had
been
cut
by
the
enemy
the
army
had
to
live
miserably
on
what
it
could
wring
out
of
the
which
victor
two
months
before
had
stripped
to
the
very
bones
wellesley
had
hoped
to
be
fed
by
the
spanish
government
when
he
threw
up
his
line
of
communication
with
abrantes
and
took
up
that
with
badajoz
but
the
spanish
government
was
a
broken
reed
on
which
to
lean
if
it
fed
its
own
armies
most
imperfectly
it
was
hardly
to
be
expected
that
it
would
deal
more
liberally
with
its
allies
the
trifling
stores
brought
from
talavera
had
long
been
exhausted
the
had
been
eaten
bare
from
the
south
very
little
could
be
procured
the
spanish
lozano
de
torres
occasionally
sent
up
a
small
consignment
of
flour
from
caceres
and
truxillo
but
it
did
not
suffice
to
give
the
army
even
it
was
to
no
purpose
that
at
abrantes
provisions
abounded
at
this
moment
for
there
was
no
means
of
getting
them
forward
from
portugal
the
enemy
lay
between
the
army
and
its
base
dépôt
and
there
was
no
transport
available
to
bring
up
the
food
by
the
circuitous
route
of
villa
velha
and
portalegre
even
so
early
as
august
wellesley
began
to
write
that
a
starving
army
is
actually
worse
than
none
the
soldiers
lose
their
discipline
and
their
spirit
they
plunder
in
the
very
presence
of
their
officers
the
officers
are
discontented
and
almost
as
bad
as
the
men
with
the
army
that
a
fortnight
ago
beat
double
their
numbers
i
should
now
hesitate
to
meet
a
french
corps
of
half
that
on
the
eleventh
he
wrote
to
warn
cuesta
that
unless
he
was
provided
with
food
of
some
sort
he
should
remain
no
longer
in
his
advanced
position
but
fall
back
towards
badajoz
whatever
might
be
the
consequences
it
is
impossible
he
stated
for
me
to
remain
any
longer
in
a
country
in
which
no
arrangement
has
been
made
for
the
supply
of
provisions
to
the
troops
and
in
which
all
the
provisions
that
are
either
found
in
the
country
or
are
sent
from
seville
as
i
have
been
informed
for
the
use
of
the
british
army
are
applied
solely
and
exclusively
to
the
use
of
the
spanish
troops
that
this
official
did
something
if
not
so
much
as
wellesley
required
is
shown
by
the
letter
to
cuesta
of
in
which
it
is
said
that
the
british
army
has
received
no
provisions
since
it
was
at
deleytosa
excepting
some
sent
from
truxillo
by
señor
lozano
de
torres
while
again
on
wellesley
says
that
we
have
had
nothing
since
the
third
save
lbs
of
biscuit
and
that
was
divided
among
say
on
wellesley
writes
from
jaraicejo
to
say
that
the
dépôt
at
abrantes
is
much
too
large
and
that
some
of
the
flour
ought
to
be
sent
back
to
santarem
or
even
to
lisbon
till
only
rations
should
be
left
wellesley
to
his
brother
lord
wellesley
at
seville
the
junta
sent
wellesley
a
letter
of
praise
for
his
doings
at
talavera
a
present
of
horses
and
a
commission
as
in
their
army
but
food
they
did
not
send
in
any
sufficient
quantities
all
the
convoys
that
came
up
from
andalusia
were
made
over
to
cuesta
s
army
and
the
estremaduran
districts
which
were
supposed
to
be
allotted
for
the
sustenance
of
the
british
had
little
or
nothing
to
give
when
we
remember
that
in
june
victor
had
described
this
same
region
as
absolutely
exhausted
and
incapable
of
furnishing
the
corps
with
even
five
days
supplies
we
shall
not
wonder
that
wellesley
s
troops
starved
there
in
august
it
was
impossible
however
to
convince
the
british
general
that
the
suffering
of
his
men
were
the
result
of
spanish
penury
rather
than
of
spanish
negligence
and
bad
faith
there
was
much
just
foundation
for
his
complaints
for
the
junta
after
so
many
promises
had
sent
him
no
train
from
andalusia
moreover
detachments
and
marauding
bands
from
cuesta
s
army
frequently
intercepted
the
small
supplies
of
food
which
british
foraging
parties
were
able
to
procure
when
taxed
with
their
misdoings
cuesta
replied
that
wellesley
s
men
had
not
unfrequently
seized
and
plundered
his
own
convoys
which
was
undoubtedly
true
and
that
the
british
soldiers
were
enjoying
such
abundance
that
he
had
been
told
that
some
of
them
were
actually
selling
their
to
the
spaniards
because
they
had
no
need
of
it
which
was
most
certainly
false
see
wellesley
to
cuesta
from
jaraicejo
lord
munster
confesses
that
so
pressing
were
our
wants
that
one
of
our
commissaries
took
from
them
the
spaniards
by
force
a
hundred
bullocks
and
a
hundred
mule
loads
of
cuesta
needs
no
further
justification
but
it
is
clear
that
his
own
men
were
doing
things
precisely
similar
see
the
dispatch
to
cuesta
of
that
wellesley
was
using
no
exaggerated
terms
when
he
declared
that
his
army
was
literally
perishing
for
want
of
food
is
proved
by
the
narratives
of
a
score
of
british
officers
who
were
present
in
the
talavera
campaign
that
his
ultimate
retreat
was
caused
by
nothing
but
the
necessity
of
saving
his
men
is
perfectly
clear
the
strategical
advantage
of
maintaining
the
position
behind
the
almaraz
passage
was
so
evident
and
the
political
disadvantages
of
withdrawing
were
so
obvious
that
a
man
of
wellesley
s
keen
insight
into
the
facts
of
war
must
have
desired
to
hold
on
as
long
as
was
possible
unless
soult
were
actually
attacking
portugal
mirabete
and
jaraicejo
afforded
the
best
ground
that
could
be
selected
for
containing
and
imposing
upon
the
enemy
so
long
as
the
british
army
lay
there
it
was
practically
unassailable
from
the
front
while
it
was
admirably
placed
for
the
purpose
of
making
an
irruption
into
the
midst
of
the
enemy
s
lines
if
he
should
disperse
his
corps
in
search
of
food
or
detach
large
forces
towards
la
mancha
or
leon
if
i
could
only
have
fed
wrote
wellesley
i
could
after
some
time
have
struck
a
brilliant
blow
either
upon
soult
at
plasencia
or
upon
mortier
in
the
centre
it
is
clear
that
by
a
dash
across
the
almaraz
passage
he
could
have
fallen
upon
either
of
these
forces
and
assailed
it
with
good
hope
of
success
before
it
could
be
succoured
by
the
other
but
such
a
venture
was
impossible
to
an
army
which
had
lost
of
its
cavalry
horses
from
starvation
within
three
weeks
and
whose
battalions
were
brought
so
low
by
physical
exhaustion
that
few
of
them
could
be
relied
upon
to
march
ten
miles
in
a
day
see
especially
the
remarks
of
leach
george
napier
stothert
and
cooper
wellesley
to
castlereagh
from
truxillo
wellesley
declared
that
having
once
linked
his
fortunes
to
those
of
the
spanish
army
of
estremadura
he
had
considered
himself
bound
to
with
it
as
long
as
was
humanly
speaking
possible
and
implicit
credit
may
be
given
to
his
assertion
the
limit
of
physical
endurance
however
was
reached
on
august
the
day
on
which
he
was
finally
compelled
to
commence
his
retreat
in
the
direction
of
truxillo
and
badajoz
in
his
dispatch
to
the
marquis
wellesley
from
merida
he
observes
that
he
had
considered
himself
in
honour
bound
to
continue
his
unless
soult
should
invade
portugal
or
the
spaniards
should
move
off
towards
another
theatre
of
war
la
mancha
or
he
should
himself
be
starved
out
as
actually
happened
before
that
day
arrived
one
event
occurred
which
seemed
to
make
useful
between
the
two
allied
armies
more
feasible
than
it
had
been
at
any
date
since
the
campaign
began
on
the
night
of
august
cuesta
whose
health
had
been
steadily
growing
worse
since
the
injuries
that
he
had
received
at
medellin
was
disabled
by
a
paralytic
stroke
which
deprived
him
of
the
use
of
one
of
his
legs
he
resigned
on
the
following
day
and
was
succeeded
by
his
eguia
an
officer
whose
conciliatory
manners
and
mild
disposition
promised
to
make
communication
between
the
head
quarters
of
the
two
allied
armies
comparatively
friendly
cuesta
after
receiving
from
the
central
junta
a
letter
of
recall
couched
in
the
most
flattering
terms
retired
to
the
baths
of
alhama
when
he
had
somewhat
recovered
his
strength
he
turned
his
energies
to
writing
a
long
vindication
of
his
whole
conduct
in
and
then
engaged
in
a
furious
controversy
with
venegas
concerning
the
latter
s
disobedience
of
orders
in
july
engaged
in
these
harmless
pursuits
he
ceased
to
be
a
source
of
danger
to
his
country
unfortunately
his
removal
from
the
theatre
of
war
was
not
of
such
benefit
to
the
common
cause
as
might
have
been
hoped
the
junta
found
ere
long
a
general
just
as
rash
and
incapable
if
not
quite
so
old
to
whom
to
entrust
the
command
of
its
largest
army
juan
carlos
areizaga
the
vanquished
of
ocaña
was
entirely
worthy
to
be
the
spiritual
heir
of
cuesta
s
policy
but
for
the
present
general
eguia
was
for
some
weeks
in
charge
of
the
army
of
estremadura
his
first
idea
was
to
persuade
wellesley
to
postpone
his
departure
and
to
retain
his
advanced
position
he
urged
this
request
upon
his
colleague
with
more
zeal
than
tact
and
to
no
good
effect
by
using
in
one
of
his
dispatches
the
phrase
that
other
considerations
besides
the
want
of
food
must
be
determining
the
movements
of
the
british
army
he
roused
wellesley
s
wrath
the
famine
was
so
real
that
any
insinuation
that
it
was
a
mere
pretext
for
retreat
was
certainly
calculated
to
wound
the
general
whose
troops
were
perishing
before
his
eyes
expressing
deep
indignation
wellesley
refused
to
listen
to
a
proposal
that
he
should
divide
with
the
estremadurans
the
stores
of
food
at
truxillo
which
indeed
were
hopelessly
inadequate
for
the
sustenance
of
two
armies
nor
would
he
even
accept
an
offer
made
him
on
august
by
lorenzo
calvo
de
rozas
who
came
in
haste
from
the
central
junta
to
the
effect
that
he
might
appropriate
the
whole
of
the
magazine
at
truxillo
leaving
the
spanish
army
to
provide
for
itself
from
other
resources
the
proposal
was
probably
honest
and
genuine
but
wellesley
knew
the
dilatory
habits
of
the
junta
so
well
that
he
was
convinced
that
the
dépôt
made
over
to
him
would
never
be
properly
replenished
and
would
soon
run
dry
eguia
s
unhappy
phrase
was
if
notwithstanding
this
answer
to
the
effect
that
the
truxillo
magazines
should
be
placed
in
charge
of
a
british
commissary
your
excellency
should
persist
in
marching
your
troops
into
portugal
i
shall
be
convinced
that
other
causes
and
not
only
the
want
of
subsistence
have
induced
your
excellency
to
decide
on
taking
such
a
from
deleytosa
aug
i
have
had
the
honour
of
receiving
your
excellency
s
letter
of
this
day
s
date
and
i
feel
much
concerned
that
anything
should
have
occurred
to
induce
your
excellency
to
express
a
doubt
of
the
truth
of
what
i
have
written
to
you
as
however
your
excellency
entertains
that
doubt
any
further
correspondence
between
us
appears
unnecessary
and
accordingly
this
is
the
last
letter
which
i
shall
have
the
honour
of
addressing
to
wellesley
to
eguia
it
is
said
that
don
de
calvo
promised
and
engaged
to
supply
the
british
army
upon
which
i
have
only
to
observe
that
i
had
already
trusted
too
long
to
the
promises
of
spanish
agents
and
i
had
particular
reason
for
want
of
confidence
in
don
de
calvo
at
the
moment
when
he
was
assuring
me
that
the
british
army
should
have
all
the
food
the
country
could
afford
i
had
in
my
possession
an
order
from
him
directing
the
magistrates
of
guadalupe
to
send
to
the
spanish
head
quarters
provisions
which
a
british
commissary
had
prepared
for
the
magazine
at
to
marquis
wellesley
marching
therefore
by
short
stages
for
the
exhaustion
of
his
troops
made
rapid
progress
impossible
he
started
from
jaraicejo
on
august
and
moved
by
truxillo
and
miajadas
to
the
valley
of
the
guadiana
where
he
cantoned
the
army
about
merida
montijo
and
badajoz
the
british
head
quarters
were
fixed
at
the
place
from
september
till
december
and
excepting
for
some
small
changes
in
detail
the
army
retained
the
position
which
it
had
now
taken
up
for
nearly
four
months
in
the
fertile
region
along
the
guadiana
the
troops
were
fed
without
much
trouble
but
they
did
not
recover
the
health
that
they
had
lost
in
the
time
of
starvation
among
the
barren
hills
behind
arzobispo
and
mirabete
in
spite
of
the
junction
of
reinforcements
and
the
return
of
convalescents
to
the
ranks
the
army
could
never
show
more
than
from
to
men
under
arms
during
the
autumn
months
when
the
rainy
season
began
the
intermittent
ague
which
was
known
to
the
british
as
guadiana
fever
was
never
absent
it
did
not
often
kill
but
it
disabled
men
by
the
thousand
and
it
was
not
till
wellesley
moved
back
into
portugal
at
midwinter
that
the
regiments
recovered
their
normal
health
i
have
no
provisions
no
horses
no
means
of
transport
i
am
overloaded
with
sick
the
horses
of
the
cavalry
are
scarcely
able
to
march
or
those
of
the
artillery
to
draw
their
guns
the
officers
and
soldiers
alike
are
worn
down
by
want
of
food
and
privations
of
every
wellesley
to
marquis
wellesley
miajadas
if
he
had
been
free
to
follow
his
personal
inclination
it
is
probable
that
wellesley
would
have
moved
back
into
portugal
in
september
but
strategical
and
political
reasons
made
this
impossible
while
based
on
badajoz
he
still
threatened
the
french
hold
on
the
valley
of
the
tagus
and
compelled
the
king
to
keep
two
army
corps
at
least
in
his
front
since
it
was
always
possible
that
he
might
return
to
almaraz
and
threaten
madrid
a
containing
force
had
to
be
told
off
against
him
he
was
also
in
a
position
from
which
he
could
easily
sally
out
to
check
raids
upon
portugal
from
badajoz
he
could
either
join
beresford
in
a
few
marches
or
fall
by
alcantara
upon
the
flank
of
any
detachment
that
soult
might
lead
forward
in
the
direction
of
castello
branco
and
abrantes
he
was
convinced
that
no
such
raids
would
be
made
but
their
possibility
had
to
be
taken
into
consideration
and
while
lying
in
his
present
cantonments
he
was
well
placed
for
frustrating
them
but
political
considerations
were
even
more
powerful
than
military
considerations
in
chaining
him
to
badajoz
the
junta
at
seville
were
most
anxious
to
keep
the
british
army
in
their
front
they
were
convinced
that
if
it
retired
on
portugal
joseph
and
soult
would
at
once
organize
an
invasion
of
andalusia
and
they
were
well
aware
that
eguia
and
venegas
would
not
suffice
to
hold
back
the
men
who
might
then
be
directed
against
them
in
the
dispatches
which
the
marquis
wellesley
who
had
superseded
frere
at
seville
on
august
kept
sending
to
his
brother
the
main
fact
conveyed
was
the
absolute
despair
with
which
the
spanish
government
viewed
the
prospect
of
the
removal
of
their
allies
towards
portugal
don
martin
de
garay
the
secretary
to
the
junta
declared
to
me
with
expressions
of
the
deepest
sorrow
and
terror
wrote
the
marquis
on
august
that
if
your
army
should
quit
spain
at
this
critical
moment
inevitable
and
immediate
ruin
must
ensue
to
his
government
to
whatever
provinces
remain
under
its
authority
to
the
cause
of
spain
itself
and
to
every
interest
connected
with
the
alliance
so
happily
established
between
great
britain
and
the
spanish
nation
no
argument
produced
the
effect
of
diminishing
the
urgency
of
his
entreaties
and
i
have
ascertained
that
his
sensations
are
in
no
degree
more
powerful
than
those
of
the
government
and
of
every
description
of
people
within
this
city
and
its
vicinity
viewing
the
painful
consequences
that
would
follow
your
retreat
into
portugal
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
submit
to
your
consideration
the
possibility
of
adopting
some
intermediate
plan
which
may
have
some
of
the
advantages
of
retreat
into
portugal
without
occasioning
alarm
in
spain
and
so
endangering
the
foundations
of
the
alliance
between
that
country
and
great
britain
lord
wellesley
to
sir
arthur
wellesley
seville
a
stay
at
badajoz
was
obviously
the
only
intermediate
plan
that
was
worth
taking
into
consideration
and
considering
the
urgency
of
his
brother
s
representations
wellesley
could
not
refuse
to
halt
within
the
spanish
border
the
military
advantages
of
the
position
that
he
had
now
taken
up
were
not
inconsiderable
and
no
profit
that
could
have
been
got
by
returning
into
portugal
could
have
counterbalanced
the
loss
of
the
spanish
alliance
in
the
valley
of
the
central
guadiana
therefore
the
british
army
remained
cantoned
but
no
arguments
that
the
junta
could
produce
availed
to
persuade
wellesley
to
engage
in
another
campaign
with
a
spanish
colleague
at
his
side
not
even
when
the
tempting
offer
was
made
that
albuquerque
should
be
given
command
of
half
of
the
estremaduran
army
and
placed
under
his
orders
would
he
consent
to
pledge
himself
to
offensive
operations
meanwhile
dispatches
had
arrived
from
england
containing
the
official
news
that
the
austrian
war
was
at
an
end
rumours
to
that
effect
had
already
reached
the
british
camps
from
french
sources
before
wellesley
left
oropesa
the
whole
character
of
the
continental
struggle
was
changed
by
the
fact
that
the
emperor
had
once
more
the
power
to
send
reinforcements
to
spain
or
even
to
go
there
himself
the
situation
required
further
consideration
and
the
british
government
resolved
to
place
upon
wellesley
s
shoulders
the
task
of
deciding
whether
the
struggle
in
the
peninsula
could
still
be
maintained
and
how
in
the
event
of
his
giving
an
affirmative
answer
it
could
best
be
carried
on
he
replied
that
in
the
existing
state
of
affairs
and
considering
the
bad
state
of
the
spanish
armies
neither
nor
even
british
troops
would
suffice
to
maintain
andalusia
against
the
unlimited
numbers
of
french
whom
the
emperor
could
now
send
across
the
pyrenees
but
he
held
that
portugal
might
be
defended
with
success
if
the
portuguese
army
and
militia
could
be
completed
to
their
full
strength
and
the
country
well
organized
for
resistance
it
was
probable
that
the
borders
of
portugal
could
not
be
maintained
the
whole
country
is
frontier
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
penetrating
by
some
point
or
he
would
have
therefore
to
confine
himself
to
preserving
what
is
most
important
the
but
this
he
was
prepared
to
undertake
and
strongly
advised
the
ministry
to
make
no
attempt
to
defend
both
andalusia
and
portugal
but
to
leave
the
junta
to
their
own
vain
devices
and
to
make
sure
of
lisbon
the
armistice
of
znaim
was
signed
july
the
falmouth
packet
with
the
news
reached
lisbon
only
on
yet
wellesley
had
heard
rumours
of
peace
as
early
as
iv
canning
to
lord
wellesley
london
the
question
which
first
arises
is
whether
the
state
of
things
in
spain
be
such
as
that
a
british
army
of
men
acting
in
with
the
spanish
armies
could
be
reasonably
expected
either
to
effect
the
deliverance
of
the
whole
peninsula
or
to
make
head
against
the
augmented
force
which
bonaparte
may
now
be
enabled
to
direct
against
that
country
upon
this
question
your
excellency
will
receive
the
opinion
of
sir
wellesley
to
whom
a
copy
of
this
dispatch
is
transmitted
if
the
opinion
of
sir
wellesley
shall
be
that
with
so
limited
a
force
as
men
offensive
operations
in
spain
could
not
prudently
be
attempted
and
if
he
shall
conceive
that
the
utmost
object
to
which
such
an
army
would
be
adequate
is
the
defence
of
portugal
your
excellency
will
then
only
have
to
state
to
the
spanish
government
the
nature
of
the
instructions
under
which
sir
wellesley
now
acts
if
on
the
other
hand
sir
wellesley
shall
entertain
the
opinion
that
with
an
effective
british
army
of
combined
with
the
spanish
and
portuguese
armies
it
might
be
possible
either
to
expel
the
french
from
spain
or
to
resist
even
their
augmented
force
with
a
reasonable
prospect
of
success
your
excellency
will
then
also
receive
the
opinion
of
sir
wellesley
as
to
the
conditions
necessary
to
be
obtained
from
the
spanish
government
as
a
preliminary
to
entering
on
any
concerted
system
of
joint
military
for
wellesley
s
answer
to
canning
see
his
reply
to
his
brother
on
containing
his
observation
on
secretary
canning
s
dispatch
of
combined
with
the
reference
to
his
own
dispatch
of
which
as
he
writes
to
castlereagh
on
gives
the
government
my
opinion
upon
all
the
points
referred
to
in
canning
s
the
quotation
above
comes
from
this
document
of
thus
in
september
wellesley
enunciated
with
great
clearness
the
policy
that
he
was
about
to
employ
in
the
next
year
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
are
already
hovering
before
his
imagination
and
after
a
flying
visit
to
lisbon
in
october
they
took
definite
shape
in
his
memorandum
for
colonel
fletcher
of
the
twentieth
of
that
month
in
that
document
the
whole
project
for
defending
the
portuguese
capital
by
a
series
of
concentric
fortifications
is
set
forth
and
the
modifications
which
it
afterwards
suffered
were
only
in
matters
of
detail
in
short
the
lines
which
were
to
check
masséna
had
been
thought
out
in
the
british
general
s
provident
mind
exactly
twelve
months
before
the
french
army
appeared
in
front
of
them
in
following
the
fortunes
of
wellesley
we
have
now
got
far
beyond
the
point
to
which
we
have
conducted
the
general
history
of
the
talavera
campaign
it
is
time
to
turn
back
to
the
movements
of
soult
and
king
joseph
and
to
explain
the
reasons
which
made
it
possible
for
the
british
army
to
remain
unmolested
at
jaraicejo
and
mirabete
till
august
and
then
to
retire
to
merida
and
badajoz
without
imperilling
the
safety
of
their
estremaduran
allies
the
king
as
we
have
already
seen
had
made
up
his
mind
that
the
point
at
this
stage
of
the
campaign
was
to
make
an
end
of
the
army
of
venegas
and
to
relieve
madrid
from
danger
he
had
therefore
called
victor
towards
toledo
and
directed
mortier
to
relieve
the
divisions
of
the
corps
which
lay
at
talavera
with
troops
from
the
corps
the
result
of
this
movement
was
to
leave
soult
too
weak
to
undertake
any
important
operations
against
portugal
for
mortier
s
men
being
strung
out
on
the
long
line
from
talavera
to
navalmoral
with
both
wellesley
s
and
cuesta
s
armies
in
their
front
could
not
be
relied
upon
to
lend
aid
for
an
advance
on
castello
branco
or
abrantes
the
duke
of
dalmatia
therefore
when
he
had
reached
plasencia
could
dispose
of
nothing
but
his
own
corps
and
lahoussaye
s
four
regiments
of
dragoons
he
dared
not
march
on
portugal
with
no
more
than
men
when
the
allies
had
it
in
their
power
to
fall
upon
mortier
the
moment
that
his
back
was
turned
accordingly
he
waited
at
plasencia
sending
out
cavalry
to
coria
and
torejoncillo
but
did
nothing
more
meanwhile
beresford
and
the
two
british
brigades
from
lisbon
were
drawing
near
him
and
on
august
the
portuguese
cavalry
advancing
from
the
pass
of
perales
and
moraleja
drove
out
the
two
french
squadrons
which
were
occupying
coria
and
thus
warned
soult
that
a
new
army
was
coming
into
play
against
him
two
days
later
beresford
had
transferred
himself
to
the
castello
branco
road
and
a
force
of
men
had
been
thrown
between
the
corps
and
the
portuguese
frontier
meanwhile
the
king
had
met
with
unexpected
good
fortune
in
his
attack
on
venegas
on
august
he
had
set
out
from
valdemoro
with
the
intention
of
attacking
the
army
of
la
mancha
in
its
position
at
aranjuez
it
seemed
unlikely
that
he
would
find
it
there
for
venegas
had
displayed
such
excessive
caution
in
his
advance
from
the
sierra
morena
to
the
tagus
and
had
so
tamely
refused
to
take
his
opportunity
of
pouncing
upon
madrid
that
it
seemed
probable
that
he
would
retreat
at
the
first
sign
of
the
king
s
approach
but
rushing
to
the
opposite
extreme
of
conduct
the
spanish
general
was
now
ready
to
court
destruction
he
had
received
on
the
preceding
night
that
of
august
cuesta
s
dispatch
of
the
third
informing
him
that
soult
had
crossed
the
mountains
and
that
both
the
british
and
the
estremaduran
armies
were
quitting
talavera
the
warned
him
that
he
might
expect
an
attack
from
the
king
s
army
and
ordered
him
to
avoid
an
action
and
to
fall
back
towards
the
despeña
perros
if
he
were
pressed
serenely
putting
aside
the
orders
of
cuesta
venegas
refused
to
retreat
and
announced
that
he
should
not
copy
the
conduct
of
a
superior
who
had
fled
even
before
the
enemy
was
in
sight
he
announced
his
intention
of
fighting
and
directed
his
army
to
concentrate
in
the
neighbourhood
of
aranjuez
of
his
five
divisions
three
were
holding
that
town
when
the
french
came
in
sight
the
other
two
were
écheloned
between
aranjuez
and
tembleque
apparently
in
order
to
watch
the
roads
from
toledo
and
añover
the
enemy
might
as
venegas
saw
turn
his
flank
either
by
crossing
the
bridges
of
the
former
place
or
by
passing
the
easy
ford
at
the
latter
a
detachment
of
men
had
been
left
to
watch
the
debouches
from
toledo
and
a
couple
of
battalions
observed
the
ford
of
añover
king
joseph
meanwhile
marching
with
a
force
composed
of
sebastiani
s
corps
the
central
reserve
and
milhaud
s
division
of
dragoons
arrived
in
front
of
aranjuez
on
august
sebastiani
whose
troops
led
the
advance
drove
in
the
spanish
outposts
who
retired
across
the
tagus
and
broke
the
town
bridge
behind
them
but
beyond
the
river
the
greater
part
of
the
army
of
la
mancha
was
visible
in
battle
order
prepared
to
receive
the
attack
venegas
himself
however
chanced
to
be
absent
at
the
moment
as
he
had
ridden
over
that
morning
to
visit
his
left
wing
and
general
giron
was
in
temporary
charge
of
the
defence
sebastiani
risked
an
attack
on
the
spanish
position
which
was
accessible
by
means
of
two
fords
but
finding
that
the
enemy
was
in
great
force
and
stood
firm
he
drew
off
his
men
after
a
sharp
skirmish
king
joseph
now
determined
not
to
press
the
attack
on
aranjuez
and
its
fords
but
to
cross
the
tagus
at
points
where
he
could
secure
a
less
difficult
passage
he
countermarched
sebastiani
s
corps
to
the
bridge
of
toledo
and
gave
milhaud
orders
to
force
the
ford
of
añover
this
manœuvre
cost
him
three
days
it
was
only
on
the
evening
of
august
that
he
succeeded
in
concentrating
his
main
body
at
toledo
on
the
following
morning
sebastiani
passed
the
bridges
and
drove
off
the
spanish
detachment
that
was
observing
them
it
fell
back
on
a
larger
force
and
the
corps
pressing
its
advance
came
into
contact
with
a
whole
hostile
division
venegas
had
not
failed
to
guess
the
plan
which
the
king
would
adopt
and
had
moved
off
from
aranjuez
towards
toledo
by
roads
parallel
to
those
which
the
french
had
employed
his
division
bayonets
under
zerain
was
in
front
and
thus
was
the
first
to
meet
sebastiani
s
attack
it
was
driven
in
after
a
sharp
skirmish
and
retired
a
few
miles
to
the
small
town
of
almonacid
on
the
to
mora
and
madridejos
on
the
same
evening
milhaud
s
dragoons
assailed
the
ford
of
añover
drove
off
the
small
force
that
was
guarding
it
and
fell
into
line
on
sebastiani
s
left
flank
on
the
next
morning
venegas
came
up
with
his
remaining
four
divisions
those
of
lacy
vigodet
giron
and
castejon
and
joined
zerain
at
almonacid
thus
both
sides
were
concentrated
for
battle
save
that
joseph
and
his
reserves
owing
to
the
delay
caused
by
a
defile
over
the
narrow
bridge
of
toledo
were
some
ten
miles
to
the
rear
of
sebastiani
the
spanish
army
after
the
deduction
of
men
in
hospital
or
detached
amounted
to
about
men
of
whom
nearly
were
horse
it
had
forty
guns
the
king
and
sebastiani
had
some
sabres
and
bayonets
but
of
these
nearly
were
cavalry
so
that
the
french
army
enjoyed
its
usual
preponderance
in
that
arm
in
numbers
no
less
than
in
efficiency
two
of
its
infantry
divisions
those
of
leval
and
sebastiani
had
suffered
heavily
at
talavera
the
rest
of
the
infantry
valence
s
poles
and
the
king
s
guards
and
reserves
had
not
been
engaged
in
that
battle
all
the
cavalry
was
equally
intact
the
french
force
at
almonacid
stood
as
follows
corps
sebastiani
s
division
men
valence
s
leval
s
and
merlin
milhaud
s
dragoons
had
men
present
the
king
had
brought
up
horse
and
about
foot
of
his
guards
and
of
dessolles
division
the
total
therefore
was
about
cavalry
and
foot
both
armies
were
prepared
to
fight
king
joseph
had
resolved
that
madrid
would
never
be
safe
till
the
army
of
la
mancha
had
been
beaten
venegas
was
eager
to
meet
him
he
had
persuaded
himself
that
the
french
troops
which
had
passed
the
bridge
of
toledo
did
not
amount
to
more
than
men
and
hoped
for
an
easy
victory
he
held
a
council
of
war
on
the
night
of
the
tenth
and
found
his
subordinates
as
ready
to
fight
as
himself
they
determined
to
attack
sebastiani
on
the
dawn
of
august
and
the
exclaimed
with
exultation
that
whatever
other
spanish
officers
might
do
he
at
least
would
never
earn
the
nickname
of
general
this
remark
i
find
in
the
narrative
of
general
bouligni
the
commanding
officer
of
engineers
in
the
army
of
la
mancha
arteche
vi
venegas
was
aiming
his
sneer
at
castaños
and
at
la
romana
who
had
got
the
nickname
of
marquis
de
la
romeria
from
his
perpetual
strategical
movements
to
the
rear
the
french
however
anticipated
venegas
for
on
the
morning
of
august
at
five
o
clock
sebastiani
presented
himself
in
front
of
the
spanish
position
and
opened
a
furious
attack
without
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
king
joseph
and
the
reserve
the
army
of
la
mancha
had
therefore
to
fight
a
defensive
engagement
and
never
got
the
chance
of
carrying
out
the
ambitious
designs
of
its
chief
the
of
almonacid
bears
a
strong
resemblance
to
that
of
ucles
where
venegas
six
months
before
had
made
such
a
deplorable
début
in
the
character
of
a
fighting
as
at
ucles
the
spanish
army
was
arrayed
on
a
series
of
eminences
on
each
side
of
a
small
town
with
a
long
array
of
infantry
and
guns
in
its
centre
and
the
cavalry
on
the
wings
as
if
to
emphasize
the
resemblance
venegas
committed
his
old
fault
of
keeping
no
adequate
reserve
in
hand
and
distributed
his
whole
force
in
one
thin
line
with
no
more
than
four
battalions
and
two
cavalry
regiments
drawn
up
in
support
to
the
rear
of
the
centre
the
only
points
in
which
there
was
a
marked
difference
between
ucles
and
almonacid
was
that
on
the
latter
field
the
eminence
on
the
spanish
left
a
hill
called
los
cerrojones
was
so
much
higher
than
the
rest
of
the
ground
that
it
formed
the
key
of
the
position
just
as
the
cerro
de
medellin
had
done
at
talavera
moreover
there
was
a
long
hill
behind
almonacid
the
cerro
del
castillo
which
gave
an
admirable
for
the
army
if
it
should
be
forced
out
of
its
first
the
main
line
of
the
spanish
order
of
battle
was
formed
counting
from
right
to
left
by
the
divisions
of
vigodet
no
castejon
no
zerain
no
and
lacy
no
with
a
brigade
of
the
division
of
giron
no
continuing
the
array
on
to
the
cerrojones
the
second
brigade
of
giron
formed
the
sole
reserve
it
was
drawn
up
on
the
cerro
del
castillo
where
the
ruins
of
the
mediaeval
fort
that
gave
the
hill
its
name
were
turned
to
account
as
a
place
of
strength
it
had
two
cavalry
regiments
in
its
rear
the
rest
of
the
troops
of
that
arm
were
distributed
between
the
two
flanks
when
sebastiani
came
upon
the
field
he
fell
upon
the
spanish
line
without
a
moment
s
hesitation
apparently
he
thought
that
delay
would
only
give
the
enemy
time
to
rearrange
his
troops
and
strengthen
his
weak
points
at
any
rate
he
did
not
wait
for
the
arrival
of
the
king
and
the
reserve
but
attacked
at
once
it
was
the
same
fault
that
victor
had
committed
at
talavera
but
sebastiani
was
not
destined
to
receive
the
condign
punishment
that
befell
the
duke
of
belluno
noting
that
the
steep
hill
on
the
spanish
left
was
the
key
of
the
position
he
resolved
to
storm
it
before
attacking
the
rest
of
the
hostile
line
accordingly
he
threw
out
milhaud
s
dragoons
and
his
own
french
division
to
contain
the
spanish
centre
and
right
while
leval
s
germans
and
valence
s
poles
were
directed
to
assail
the
cerrojones
the
former
division
turned
the
flank
of
the
hill
while
the
latter
attacked
it
in
front
the
spanish
brigade
on
the
hill
made
a
stubborn
resistance
and
even
held
back
the
poles
till
its
flank
was
turned
by
the
germans
venegas
sent
to
its
aid
his
miserably
inadequate
reserve
under
giron
and
some
battalions
drawn
from
the
first
division
but
these
troops
came
too
late
the
cerrojones
were
lost
and
the
reinforcements
only
succeeded
in
checking
the
french
advance
behind
the
hill
on
the
slopes
between
it
and
almonacid
the
key
of
the
position
was
thus
in
sebastiani
s
hands
and
seeing
the
spanish
centre
outflanked
he
let
loose
upon
it
his
french
division
which
drove
in
lacy
and
zerain
and
captured
the
town
of
almonacid
and
three
guns
venegas
was
thus
forced
to
draw
back
his
whole
line
and
it
on
the
cerro
del
castillo
which
lay
behind
his
original
position
the
troops
were
much
disordered
by
this
retrograde
movement
yet
made
a
very
creditable
effort
to
maintain
their
new
ground
but
king
joseph
and
the
reserve
had
now
come
on
the
field
and
dessolles
troops
were
thrown
into
the
front
line
to
aid
the
infantry
of
the
corps
after
a
stubborn
fight
the
spanish
left
and
centre
again
broke
and
venegas
was
only
able
to
save
them
from
complete
destruction
by
bringing
up
vigodet
s
division
which
was
almost
intact
and
throwing
it
in
the
way
of
the
advancing
enemy
it
held
out
long
enough
to
allow
the
main
body
to
escape
and
then
followed
its
comrades
in
retreat
down
the
to
mora
and
madridejos
the
french
cavalry
was
let
loose
in
pursuit
but
does
not
seem
to
have
been
so
successful
in
its
work
as
had
been
the
case
at
ucles
and
medellin
at
any
rate
the
bulk
of
the
spaniards
escaped
in
more
or
less
order
and
only
the
stragglers
were
cut
up
the
losses
of
venegas
s
army
would
appear
to
have
been
about
killed
and
wounded
besides
a
considerable
number
of
prisoners
perhaps
in
all
for
sebastiani
s
dispatch
giving
the
figure
of
can
not
be
trusted
the
army
of
la
mancha
had
also
lost
of
its
forty
guns
all
its
baggage
and
several
standards
still
the
defeat
was
far
less
crushing
than
medellin
had
been
and
the
whole
army
was
rallied
at
the
passes
with
no
great
difficulty
it
had
fought
very
creditably
as
is
sufficiently
vouched
for
by
the
fact
that
sebastiani
acknowledged
a
loss
of
killed
and
wounded
the
polish
division
in
especial
had
suffered
very
severely
while
storming
the
cerrojones
at
the
opening
of
the
combat
but
see
general
arteche
s
calculation
in
vi
of
his
de
la
thus
ended
the
part
taken
by
the
army
of
la
mancha
in
the
talavera
campaign
no
words
are
too
strong
to
use
in
condemnation
of
venegas
s
conduct
after
wrecking
the
plan
of
campaign
drawn
up
by
wellesley
and
cuesta
by
his
criminal
slackness
and
timidity
in
july
he
then
proceeded
to
the
extreme
of
culpable
rashness
he
had
ample
time
to
retire
to
the
south
when
his
position
was
compromised
by
the
departure
of
the
british
and
estremaduran
armies
from
talavera
instead
of
doing
so
he
remained
behind
and
courted
an
unnecessary
battle
in
which
his
unskilful
dispositions
secured
the
defeat
of
an
army
which
tried
to
do
its
duty
and
defended
itself
far
better
than
could
have
been
expected
he
should
have
been
and
shot
for
his
repeated
and
impudent
disobedience
of
cuesta
s
orders
but
the
junta
conscious
that
they
were
themselves
to
blame
for
giving
him
secret
directions
which
clashed
with
those
of
the
spared
him
and
only
removed
him
from
command
some
weeks
later
in
order
to
replace
him
by
areizaga
an
officer
of
exactly
the
same
level
of
merit
and
intelligence
after
his
or
rather
sebastiani
s
victory
at
almonacid
king
joseph
established
the
corps
in
cantonments
around
toledo
and
aranjuez
and
sent
victor
and
the
corps
into
la
mancha
to
observe
the
passes
and
to
contain
the
wrecks
of
venegas
s
army
he
returned
himself
with
his
guards
and
the
reserve
to
madrid
on
august
celebrated
a
and
published
an
extravagant
account
of
his
own
achievements
in
which
he
claimed
to
have
discomfited
the
attempt
of
enemies
there
were
but
at
the
most
liberal
estimate
with
the
aid
of
invincible
french
troops
the
of
soult
s
men
was
consigned
to
oblivion
in
this
extraordinary
document
the
moment
that
he
heard
of
the
defeat
of
venegas
soult
wrote
to
the
king
renewing
the
demand
which
he
had
made
ten
days
before
for
permission
to
invade
portugal
now
that
the
army
of
la
mancha
had
been
disposed
of
he
considered
that
victor
might
come
back
to
talavera
and
almaraz
so
as
to
set
free
mortier
and
the
corps
for
the
attack
on
portugal
he
also
suggested
that
ney
having
put
things
right
at
salamanca
might
now
be
recalled
to
the
valley
of
the
tagus
and
rejoin
the
and
corps
he
supported
his
demands
by
an
unfounded
assertion
that
wellesley
was
on
his
march
to
unite
with
beresford
by
way
of
alcantara
and
asked
for
leave
to
attack
the
latter
before
the
main
british
army
should
have
joined
him
in
a
few
days
more
he
said
it
would
be
too
late
to
move
for
beresford
and
wellesley
would
have
concentrated
their
forces
so
that
he
would
have
in
his
front
soult
to
joseph
from
plasencia
joseph
refused
to
listen
to
these
arguments
and
had
fair
reasons
to
show
for
his
negative
reply
to
the
marshal
s
requests
wellesley
as
he
truly
remarked
was
not
marching
for
alcantara
to
join
beresford
he
was
still
at
jaraicejo
in
close
touch
with
the
estremaduran
army
if
mortier
were
removed
to
the
portuguese
border
wellesley
and
eguia
might
descend
upon
victor
and
crush
him
it
was
impossible
to
leave
less
than
two
corps
to
defend
the
middle
tagus
as
for
ney
he
could
not
quit
leon
for
del
parque
and
the
galicians
were
concentrating
in
great
force
upon
his
front
indeed
he
had
just
written
to
request
that
the
corps
might
be
moved
up
to
salamanca
to
support
him
it
was
not
now
the
time
to
engage
in
further
offensive
operations
either
against
portugal
or
against
andalusia
the
troops
were
exhausted
the
hospital
of
madrid
contained
at
the
moment
sick
and
wounded
the
cavalry
was
so
distressed
by
incessant
work
that
few
regiments
could
put
men
in
line
the
transport
was
worn
out
and
new
horses
and
mules
were
impossible
to
procure
for
the
king
had
no
money
with
which
to
purchase
them
finally
and
this
was
the
most
conclusive
point
of
all
orders
had
been
received
from
the
emperor
countermanding
all
active
operations
till
the
hot
season
should
be
over
it
was
impossible
to
say
what
his
intentions
might
be
now
that
he
was
freed
from
the
austrian
war
he
might
come
himself
to
spain
or
he
might
send
large
reinforcements
to
the
king
in
any
case
it
would
be
impossible
to
move
till
his
will
was
known
and
his
mind
made
up
ney
to
jourdan
from
salamanca
see
joseph
to
clarke
and
napoleon
to
clarke
for
a
presentment
of
joseph
s
case
see
chapter
xii
of
jourdan
s
these
arguments
were
conclusive
and
soult
was
forced
to
remain
quiescent
all
that
he
could
do
was
to
push
small
parties
to
zarza
and
coria
when
beresford
had
evacuated
those
places
thus
the
talavera
campaign
came
to
an
end
there
was
now
a
long
pause
in
the
movements
both
of
the
allies
and
of
the
french
the
subsequent
fighting
in
october
belongs
to
a
totally
independent
series
of
operations
the
combatants
who
had
been
engaged
in
july
and
august
rested
in
september
soult
was
left
at
plasencia

corps
at

quarters
in

beresford

observing

from
castello

and
lastly
the
galicians
were
moving
down
by
divisions
to
join
del
parque
s
forces
at
ciudad
rodrigo
where
a
formidable
army
was
now
beginning
to
be
collected
the
talavera
campaign
in
short
had
settled
nothing
the
attempt
of
the
allies
to
capture
madrid
had
failed
but
the
attempt
of
the
french
to
surround
wellesley
and
cuesta
by
soult
s
flank
march
had
failed
also
looking
to
the
net
results
of
all
the
fighting
since
may
it
could
be
said
that
the
balance
of
loss
stood
against
the
french
they
had
abandoned
galicia
and
the
asturias
as
well
as
their
precarious
hold
on
northern
portugal
they
had
gained
nothing
save
that
their
forces
were
concentrated
in
a
good
central
position
instead
of
being
scattered
from
corunna
and
oporto
as
far
as
merida
and
manzanares
the
next
move
was
in
the
hands
of
the
emperor
it
remained
to
be
seen
how
he
would
deal
with
the
situation
in
the
peninsula
now
that
he
at
last
had
time
to
study
it
in
detail
before
passing
on
to
the
new
series
of
operations
which
took
place
in
the
late
autumn
one
minor
of
the
talavera
campaign
remains
to
be
narrated
the
fate
of
the
small
roving
column
of
spaniards
and
portuguese
under
sir
robert
wilson
which
had
been
threatening
madrid
in
the
king
s
absence
and
which
had
caused
so
many
misgivings
in
the
mind
of
marshal
victor
wilson
s
doings
were
to
give
one
more
proof
of
his
extraordinary
resourcefulness
and
vigour
if
any
further
evidence
were
needed
after
his
masterly
handling
of
lapisse
in
the
spring
it
will
be
remembered
that
on
august
he
had
slipped
away
from
escalona
on
hearing
from
wellesley
that
soult
had
descended
upon
plasencia
he
intended
to
join
the
main
army
at
talavera
but
on
nearing
that
place
discovered
that
it
had
already
been
evacuated
and
that
both
the
british
and
the
estremaduran
armies
had
disappeared
in
the
direction
of
oropesa
accordingly
he
directed
his
steps
to
the
westward
hoping
to
overtake
wellesley
on
his
march
on
his
way
however
he
was
caught
up
by
villatte
s
division
of
victor
s
corps
which
had
been
vainly
hunting
for
him
at
nombella
and
escalona
since
the
fifth
thrown
out
of
his
path
by
this
force
wilson
turned
up
into
the
mountains
intending
to
escape
by
the
northern
bank
of
the
tietar
he
soon
learnt
however
from
the
peasantry
that
soult
had
sent
a
brigade
under
foy
to
look
for
him
in
the
vera
of
plasencia
and
that
hugo
the
governor
of
avila
had
come
down
to
hold
against
him
the
passes
of
arenas
and
monbeltran
thus
ringed
around
with
foes
he
did
not
lose
his
nerve
but
turning
up
into
the
sierra
de
gredos
by
a
that
leads
from
aldea
nueva
to
the
upper
valley
of
the
alagon
escaped
in
the
direction
of
bejar
from
thence
he
intended
to
strike
across
towards
portugal
but
a
new
enemy
now
came
upon
him
he
had
evaded
villatte
and
foy
only
to
run
into
the
arms
of
ney
who
on
this
day
august
was
preparing
to
cross
the
puerto
de
baños
on
his
way
to
salamanca
there
was
still
time
to
escape
from
the
marshal
s
front
and
to
retire
to
ciudad
rodrigo
unmolested
but
wilson
saw
the
rocky
defile
of
the
puerto
in
front
of
him
and
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
holding
it
against
the
enemy
though
he
was
well
aware
that
with
a
force
of
less
than
men
destitute
of
artillery
he
could
not
seriously
hope
to
repulse
a
whole
army
corps
nevertheless
he
offered
battle
in
the
pass
and
fought
a
running
fight
for
nine
hours
against
ney
s
vanguard
defending
three
successive
positions
from
each
of
which
he
had
to
be
expelled
in
his
last
stand
he
held
on
too
long
and
allowed
the
enemy
to
close
his
four
battalions
were
all
broken
and
fled
over
the
hills
to
miranda
de
castañar
where
they
rallied
on
the
next
day
the
marshal
acknowledged
in
his
dispatch
to
king
joseph
a
loss
of
five
officers
and
thirty
men
killed
and
ten
officers
and
men
wounded
which
shows
that
he
had
been
forced
to
fight
hard
to
clear
the
pass
he
claimed
to
have
destroyed
wilson
s
detachment
and
declared
that
spaniards
and
portuguese
had
fallen
but
wilson
s
returns
show
that
his
total
loss
killed
wounded
and
missing
was
under
among
whom
there
was
not
a
single
field
officer
or
captain
having
assuaged
his
thirst
for
a
fight
by
this
gallant
if
unnecessary
engagement
wilson
escaped
to
the
pass
of
perales
and
finally
reached
castello
branco
on
august
where
he
fell
in
with
beresford
and
was
at
last
in
safety
after
his
many
wanderings
among
the
summits
of
the
sierra
de
gredos
and
the
sierra
de
gata
this
hazardous
march
was
his
last
achievement
in
the
peninsula
after
a
bitter
quarrel
with
beresford
concerning
the
status
of
his
lusitanian
legion
in
the
portuguese
army
he
sailed
for
england
in

engagement
que
sa
majesté
a
pris
de
planter
l
aigle
impériale
sur
les
forts
de
lisbonne
après
une
expédition
aussi
difficile
que
périlleuse
où
tous
les
jours
nous
avons
été
dans
la
nécessité
de
vaincre
son
excellence
ne
s
est
pas
dissimulé
non
plus
que
depuis
burgos
l
armée
a
eu
des
combats
continuels
à
soutenir
elle
a
réfléchi
sur
les
moyens
d
éviter
à
l
avenir
les
maux
que
cet
état
de
guerre
occasionne
et
elle
n
en
a
pas
trouvé
de
plus
propre
que
celui
qui
lui
est
offert
par
la
grande
majorité
des
habitants
des
principales
villes
du

d
autant
plus
qu
elle
a
l
espoir
de
voir
propager
dans

provinces
cet
exemple
et
qu
ainsi
ce
beau
pays
sera
préservé
de
nouvelles
calamités
les
intentions
de
sa
majesté
seront
plus
tôt
et
plus
glorieusement
remplies
et
notre
présence
en
portugal
qui
d
abord
avait
été
un
sujet
d
effroi
pour
les
habitants
y
sera
vue
avec
plaisir
en

qu
elle
contribuera
à
neutraliser
les
efforts
des
ennemis
de
l
empereur
sur
cette
partie
du
continent
la
tâche
que
le
maréchal
s
impose
dans
cette
circonstance
est
immense

il
a
le
courage
de
l
embrasser
et
il
croit
la
remplir
même
avec
succès
si
vous
voulez
bien
l
aider
dans

il

may
my
lord
in
my
secret
dispatch
of
the
ultimo
i
apprised
your
lordship
that
i
had
had
certain
communications
with
an
officer
of
the
french
army
in
respect
to
the
discontent
which
prevailed
against
marshal
soult
i
have
since
had
further
communications
with
the
same
officer
with
the
details
of
which
i
proceed
to
acquaint
your
lordship
captain
argenton
met
me
within
the
posts
of
the
british
army
between
coimbra
and
aveiro
on
the
night
of
the
instant
accompanied
by
mons
viana
in
the
presence
of
bathurst
he
informed
me
that
the
discontent
had
increased
and
that
there
were
a
larger
number
of
officers
who
were
determined
to
seize
their
general
than
when
he
had
last
seen
me
he
said
however
that
they
were
divided
into
two
parties
one
discontented
with
buonaparte
himself
and
determined
to
carry
matters
to
extremities
against
him
the
other
consisting
of
loison
laborde
and
others
whom
he
had
before
mentioned
as
attached
to
the
cause
of
the
emperor
were
dissatisfied
with
soult
s
conduct
particularly
with
an
intention
which
he
was
supposed
to
entertain
to
declare
himself
king
of
portugal
and
that
they
were
determined
if
he
should
take
that
step
to
seize
him
and
to
lead
the
army
back
into
france
where
it
was
understood
the
emperor
wished
to
see
it
captain
argenton
then
urged
me
again
to
lose
no
time
in
pressing
upon
soult
as
the
mode
most
likely
to
induce
the
more
violent
of
the
two
parties
to
endeavour
to
accomplish
their
purpose
but
he
said
that
if
my
attack
was
likely
to
be
delayed
it
was
desirable
that
i
should
endeavour
to
prevail
upon
some
of
the
towns
over
which
i
was
supposed
to
have
influence
such
as
coimbra
aveiro
to
follow
the
example
of
oporto
and
petition
soult
to
take
upon
himself
the
government
of
the
kingdom
as
king
and
that
i
even
should
write
to
him
to
urge
the
adoption
of
this
measure
in
answer
to
this
i
told
him
that
i
certainly
should
make
my
attack
as
soon
as
it
was
in
my
power
but
that
i
could
not
fix
any
day
nor
state
to
him
the
plan
of
my
operations
and
that
in
respect
to
his
propositions
regarding
the
measures
to
be
adopted
by
me
to
induce
soult
to
declare
himself
king
of
portugal
they
were
quite
out
of
the
question
that
i
could
not
risk
the
loss
of
the
confidence
of
the
people
of
portugal
by
doing
what
he
desired
in
respect
to
the
people
of
coimbra
aveiro
nor
my
own
character
by
writing
the
letter
which
he
proposed
i
should
i
told
him
at
the
same
time
that
i
considered
that
notwithstanding
all
that
had
passed
between
him
and
me
i
had
a
full
right
to
take
what
steps
i
pleased
even
if
the
officers
of
the
french
army
should
seize
their
general
he
then
went
away
and
mons
viana
returned
with
me
to
coimbra
and
confirmed
all
the
statements
which
captain
argenton
had
made
of
the
discontent
of
the
officers
of
the
army
i
heard
no
more
of
captain
argenton
till
the
the
day
after
the
capture
of
oporto
on
which
day
the
original
orders
for
the
arrest
and
secret
detention
of
captain
argenton
colonel
lafitte
of
the
dragoons
and
colonel
donadieu
of
the
regiment
of
infantry
were
found
among
some
papers
sent
to
me
by
the
police
of
the
town
the
order
for
the
arrest
of
the
first
bearing
date
the
and
of
the
last
two
the
instant
in
a
few
hours
afterwards
on
the
same
day
captain
argenton
came
into
oporto
and
informed
me
that
on
the
night
of
the
day
he
had
returned
from
his
last
interview
with
me
he
had
been
arrested
and
his
papers
had
been
seized
among
which
had
been
found
the
three
passports
which
i
had
given
him
he
said
that
he
attributed
his
arrest
to
the
general
of
division
lefevre
a
man
of
weak
intellect
to
whom
he
had
formerly
been
aide
de
camp
and
on
whom
he
had
endeavored
to
prevail
as
he
thought
successfully
to
join
the
party
general
lefevre
had
however
informed
soult
of
all
the
circumstances
requiring
only
his
promise
that
argenton
should
not
be
injured
and
should
retain
his
commission
and
his
military
pretensions
soult
examined
him
in
presence
of
general
lefevre
respecting
his
accomplices
but
he
declined
to
name
any
and
he
was
sent
back
to
prison
in
charge
of
a
captain
of
gendarmerie
this
person
prevailed
upon
him
with
promises
of
pardon
and
indemnity
to
all
concerned
to
consent
to
tell
soult
the
names
of
his
accomplices
which
he
did
on
the
following
night
notwithstanding
as
he
says
himself
similar
promises
in
his
own
favor
made
to
general
lefevre
had
not
been
performed
and
that
as
soon
as
he
had
named
colonels
lafitte
and
donadieu
immediate
orders
were
sent
for
their
arrest
and
secret
detention
they
marched
in
confinement
with
the
army
from
oporto
on
the
and
on
the
at
five
o
clock
in
the
morning
captain
argenton
made
his
escape
at
the
desire
of
colonel
lafitte
from
the
party
of
gendarmes
in
whose
charge
he
was
detained
he
now
declares
that
the
conspiracy
still
exists
and
that
sooner
or
later
it
must
burst
forth
and
fall
heavily
upon
the
head
of
the
usurper
and
he
talked
of
the
war
in
spain
as
being
odious
to
the
army
and
to
the
whole
nation
captain
argenton
expressed
a
desire
to
return
secretly
to
france
and
to
bring
to
england
his
wife
and
family
she
having
as
he
says
some
property
to
enable
him
to
live
in
england
till
the
arrival
of
better
times
in
france
i
told
him
that
i
would
send
him
to
england
when
an
opportunity
should
offer
to
apply
for
permission
to
go
to
france
and
i
shall
have
the
honor
of
addressing
him
to
your
lordship
when
the
opportunity
shall
occur
of
sending
him
i
have
the
honor

résumé
de

affaire
argenton
this
analysis
of
the
documents
in
the
french
archives
relating
to
the
oporto
conspiracy
has
been
placed
at
my
disposal
by
the
great
kindness
of
commandant
balagny
le
mai
dans
la
nuit
le
capitaine
argenton
était
arrêté
à
oporto
par
ordre
du
maréchal
soult
son
arrestation
avait
été
provoquée
par
les
déclarations
que
dans
cette
même
nuit
du
le
général
lefebvre
et
son
aide
de
camp
favre
étaient
venus
faire
au
maréchal

avait
fait
à
l
un
et
à
l
autre
dans
la
journée
du
des
confidences
sur
l
objet
de
deux
voyages
successifs
à
lisbonne
et
à
coïmbre
près
des
généraux
anglais
et
leur
avait
développé
le
plan
d
une
vaste
conspiration
militaire
dont
les
ramifications
s
étendaient
dans
toutes
les
armées
impériales
et
dans
plusieurs
départements
de
la
france
malgré
la
promesse
formelle
qu
ils
avaient
faite
à
argenton
de
garder
un
secret
absolu
après
s
être
concertés
à
richuza
ils
vinrent
dans
la
nuit
à
oporto
et
après
avoir
obtenu
du
maréchal
une
audience
secrète
à
heures
et
demie
du
soir
lui
dévoilèrent
ce
que
leur
avait
confié
argenton
aux
termes
de
leurs
déclarations
il
aurait
dit
à
l
un
et
à
l
autre
séparément
qu
il
était
l
agent
d
un

des
généraux

lorges

et
des
colonels

et
dont
le
but
était
de
renverser
l
empereur
pour
mettre
fin
au
régime
de
guerres
continuelles
et
de
perpétuelles
conscriptions
que
la
france
était
lasse
de
supporter
pour
servir
l
ambition
de
napoléon
pour
réaliser
ce
projet
le
comité
devait
par
son
intermédiaire
passer
une
convention
avec
l
armée
anglaise
en
portugal
aux
termes
de
cette
convention
l
armée
française
évacuerait
le
portugal
suivie
de
l
armée
anglaise
qui
l
escorterait
jusqu
aux
pyrénées
où
cette
dernière
resterait
en
observation
pour
l
appuyer
et
pour
déterminer
les
départements
du
midi
à
se
déclarer
pour
le
nouvel
état
de
choses
a
la
faveur
de
trois
délivrés
par
les
généraux
anglais
trois
officiers

devaient
se
rendre

un
aux
armées
d

l
autre
à
l
armée
d

un
troisième
en

pour
rallier
à
la

entreprise
les
mécontents
de

intérieur
et
des
armées
l
angleterre
promettait
d
appuyer
de
son
argent
le
succès
de
l
entreprise
et
wellesley
aurait
promis
à
argenton
fr
pour
les
débuts
le
général
moreau
devait
être
ramené
d
amérique
par
un
navire
anglais
et
prendre
sous
un
titre
non
encore
désigné
la
place
de
napoléon
déchu
le
maréchal
soult
serait
invité
à
se
mettre
à
la
tête
du
mouvement
si
le
maréchal
refusait
on
devait
s
emparer
de
sa
personne
de
façon
à
ce
que
son
opposition
ne
nuisît
en
rien
à
la
réussite
de
l
entreprise
ces
devaient
être
délivrés
aux
noms
supposés
de
et
d
après
les
déclarations
d
argenton
du
maréchal
soult
du
général
ricard
l
un
de
ces
devait
être
utilisé
par
le
capitaine
favre
aide
de
camp
du
général
lefebvre
qui
voulait
rentrer
en
france
pour
démissionner
l
autre
devait
servir
à
un
officier
supérieur
argenton
ne
nomme
qui
devait
aller
rendre
compte
de
la
situation
à
l
empereur
en
présence
de
pareilles
révélations
le
maréchal
soult
fit
arrêter
et
conduire
chez
lui
le
capitaine
argenton
qui
devant
le
général
lefebvre
et
favre
refit
dans
les
mêmes
termes
la
narration
du
plan
du
comité
insistant
à
diverses
reprises
pour
tenter
de
décider
le
maréchal
à
entrer
dans
ses
vues
en
lui
dépeignant
sous
des
couleurs
séduisantes
la
grandeur
et
la
noblesse
de
l
entreprise
dont
le
but
principal
était
de
rendre
à
la
france
et
à
l
europe
entière
une
paix
que
tout
le
monde
souhaitait
ardemment
et
que
la
folle
ambition
de
l
empereur
rendait
seule
impossible
mais
ne
pouvant
obtenir
du
maréchal
la
promesse
formelle
qu
aucun
des
officiers
dont
il
citerait
les
noms
ne
serait
inquiété
il
se
refusa
à
désigner
les
membres
du
comité
qui
l
avait
fait
agir
plus
tard
dans
ses
interrogatoires
en
france
il
déclara
que
devant
ce
refus
de
sa
part
le
maréchal
s
emporta
violemment
le
menaça
de
le
faire
fusiller
et
qu
il
ne
dut
son
salut
qu
à
l
intervention
généreuse
du
général
lefebvre
qui
rappela
durement
au
duc
de
dalmatie
la
promesse
solennelle
qu
il
lui
avait
faite
à
lui
lefebvre
sur
l
honneur
qu
argenton
ne
serait
point
inquiété
il
fut
réintégré
dans
sa
prison
à
son
grand
étonnement
furieux
de
se
voir
sous
les
verrous
malgré
la
promesse
formelle
que
lui
aurait
faite
le
maréchal
il
s
obstina
d
abord
dans
un
mutisme
absolu
refusant
pendant
toute
la
matinée
du
de
se
prêter
à
aucun
nouvel
interrogatoire
cependant
sur
les
instances
réitérées
et
pressantes
du
lieutenant
de
gendarmerie
bernon
que
le
maréchal
envoya
à
plusieurs
reprises
le
voir
dans
sa
prison
et
sous
la
foi
de
la
promesse
solennelle
que
lui
apporta
ce
dernier
de
la
part
du
duc
que
lui
et
tous
les
officiers
compromis
auraient
l
honneur
et
la
vie
saufs
et
qu
un
voile
épais
serait
jeté
à
jamais
sur
cette
affaire
il
se
décida
dans
la
soirée
à
écrire
au
maréchal
qu
il
consentait
à
lui
faire
des
aveux
complets
mais
se
ravisant
il
lui
écrivit
une
deuxième
lettre
où
il
mettait
comme
condition
à
ses
aveux
qu
il
n
y
aurait
un
seul
présent
à
ses
déclarations
et
qu
il
désirait
que
ce
témoin
fût
le
général
lefebvre
pour
des
raisons
qui
sont
demeurées
inconnues
le
maréchal
substitua
comme
témoin
au
général
lefebvre
le
général
ricard
et
le
lieutenant
bernon
argenton
accepta
cependant
de
faire
ses
aveux
et
fut
introduit
à
heures
du
soir
dans
le
salon
du
maréchal
le
lieutenant
bernon
et
le
général
ricard
firent
dès
le
mai
une
déclaration
écrite
des
révélations
faites
devant
eux
au
maréchal
par
argenton
dans
l
entrevue
du
mai
leurs
déclarations
concordent
entièrement
avec
celles
du
général
lefebvre
et
du
capitaine
favre
et
ce
serait
toujours
le
fameux
projet
de
renversement
de
l
empire
qu
argenton
aurait
indiqué
comme
but
du
comité
a
la
suite
de
ces
aveux
argenton
est
reconduit
dans
sa
prison
et
le
maréchal
faussant
sa
promesse
fait
arrêter
le
colonel
lafitte
qui
commandait
le
régiment
ou
servait
argenton
mais
cependant
l
armée
anglaise
se
portait
en
avant
et
à
la
suite
de
circonstances
demeurées
bien
obscures
le
maréchal
soult
était
surpris
dans
oporto
et
sur
le
point
de
ne
pouvoir
s
en
échapper
argenton
confié
à
la
garde
du
lieutenant
bernon
et
d
un
détachement
d
infanterie
est
emmené
dans
la
retraite
le
second
jour
il
s
évade
subitement
dans
des
circonstances
tellement
romanesques
que
malgré
le
rapport
du
lieutenant
bernon
au
duc
de
conégliano
on
est
quelque
peu
porté
à
croire
que
sa
fuite
fut
facilitée
par
le
commandement
le
mai
au
soir
argenton
fugitif
gagnait
oporto
et
de
là
se
rendait
à
lisbonne
d
où
l
amiral
anglais
le
faisait
conduire
à
londres
sur
un
vaisseau
anglais
avec
des
lettres
de
recommandation
pour
le
ministre
de
la
marine
bien
accueilli
par
ce
dernier
qui
lui
proposa
même
de
le
pensionner
il
séjourna
quelque
temps
à
londres
mais
pris
bientôt
de
la
nostalgie
du
pays
natal
et
dévoré
du
désir

et
atterrit
à

le

malgré
son
faux
nom
argenton
ne
tarde
pas
en

à
être
arrêté
dès
son

interrogatoire
il
s
était
décidé
à
reconnaître
son
identité
et
avouant
son
faux
de
cartel
d

il
abandonne
le
pseudonyme
de
dessort
et
redevient
argenton
mais
ici
la
scène
change
se
prêtant
volontiers
aux
interrogatoires
il
ne
fait
aucune
difficulté
pour
expliquer
ses
voyages
près
des
généraux
anglais
mais
il
leur
donne
un
but
tout
autre
et
il
assigne
au
comité
dont
il
se
dit
toujours
avoir
été
l
agent
des
intentions
totalement
différentes
de
celles
que
selon
lefebvre
ricard
favre
et
bernon
il
aurait
indiquées
à
oporto
il
n
est
plus
question
de
conspiration
contre
l
empereur
de
projets
de
renversement
dynastique
bien
au
contraire
le
comité
entièrement
dévoué
à
napoléon
et
à
sa
cause
voulait
lui
ramener
une
armée
dont
le
sort
était
gravement
compromis
par
la
maladresse
du
maréchal
soult
qui
ne
rêvait
rien
moins
que
de
faire
de
cette
armée
la
sienne
propre
et
de
s
en
servir
pour
la
réalisation
de
ses
projets
ambitieux
devant
ses
projets
ouvertement
affichés
de
se
faire
décerner
la
couronne
de
portugal
un
parti
de
mécontents
s
était
formé
pour
déjouer
ses
vues
et
le
mettre
dans
l
impossibilité
de
commettre
le
crime
de
qu
il
méditait
a
la
tête
de
ce
parti
se
trouvait
dit
argenton
un
comité
composé
des
généraux
laborde
et
loison
des
colonels
lafitte
et
géniéz
et
d
un
colonel
du
général
loison
le
comité
devait
dès
que
le
maréchal
aurait
mis
en
exécution
son
projet
nullement
déguisé
de
s
emparer
de
la
couronne
se
saisir
de
sa
personne
et
à
la
suite
d
une
convention
passée
avec
les
généraux
anglais
ramener
en
france
l
armée
restée
fidèle
à
napoléon
et
sauvée
par
cette
intervention
d
une
perte
infaillible
mais
pour
mener
à
bonne
fin
l
exécution
de
ce
projet
il
fallait
obtenir
des
généraux
anglais
qu
ils
consentissent
à
retarder
leur
attaque
qui
était
imminente
et
se
faire
délivrer
par
eux
des
pour
les
officiers
qui
devaient
aller
rendre
compte
à
l
empereur
de
ce
qui
se
passait
en
portugal
argenton
accepta
la
mission
d
aller
à
l
armée
anglaise
soumettre
les
propositions
du
comité
on
l
adressa
au
nommé
viana
à
qui
il
fut
présenté
par
le
colonel
donadieu
qui
logeait
chez
lui
et
ce
fut
ce
viana
qui
lui
servit
de
guide
et
d
escorte
jusqu
à
l
armée
anglaise
il
se
rendit
à
lisbonne
où
il
obtint
du
général
wellesley
trois
et
la
promesse
d
une
suspension
d
armes
de
quelques
jours
revenu
à
oporto
il
y
resta
quatre
jours
chez
viana
qui
lui
remit
à
destination
du
comité
un
dialogue
intitulé
le
moineau
et
le
perroquet
qui
n
était
que
le
sommaire
d
une
longue
conversation
entre
viana
et
le
maréchal
où
ce
dernier
aurait
développé
ses
projets
ambitieux
et
exposé
en
détail
la
ligne
de
conduite
qu
il
comptait
suivre
porteur
de
ce
document
il
va
rendre
compte
de
sa
mission
au
comité
le
général
laborde
étant
malade
il
rendit
compte
au
colonel
lafitte
et
le
général
loison
survenant
à
ce
moment
il
y
eut
chez
laborde
une
conférence
entre
ces
deux
généraux
et
lafitte
lui
argenton
n
y
assista
pas
mais
à
l
issue
de
cette
conférence
son
colonel
lui
déclara
qu
il
fallait
retourner
près
des
anglais
et
lui
fit
tenir
une
lettre
écrite
par
le
général
loison
au
général
wellesley
toujours
accompagné
de
viana
il
partit
d
oporto
le
mai
et
se
rendit
à
coïmbre
où
il
eut
en
présence
de
viana
une
conférence
avec
wellesley
et
finit
après
quelques
difficultés
par
obtenir
une
nouvelle
suspension
d
hostilités
pendant
quatre
jours
à
la
condition
que
le
comité
tiendrait
le
général
anglais
au
courant
des
faits
et
gestes
du
duc
de
dalmatie
de
retour
à
oporto
le
mai
il
était
arrêté
au
moment
où
il
s
apprêtait
à
partir
pour
se
rendre
près
du
telle
est
la
thèse
qu
argenton
ne
cesse
de
soutenir
avec
la
dernière
énergie
depuis
son
retour
en
france
jusque
devant
le
peloton
d
exécution
qui
va
le
fusiller
il
subit
trois
interrogatoires
à
boulogne
trois
autres
au
ministère
de
la
police
quatre
devant
la
commission
militaire
chargée
d
instruire
sa
cause
toujours
avec
la
même
impassibilité
et
le
calme
le
plus
absolu
il
répète
la
même
chose
ne
variant
que
sur
quelques
questions
de
détails
quand
on
lui
donne
lecture
des
dépositions
accablantes
des
généraux
lefebvre
et
ricard
du
capitaine
favre
et
du
lieutenant
bernon
il
leur
oppose
froidement
les
dénégations
les
plus
formelles
il
est
confronté
avec
les
colonels
donadieu
et
lafitte
qui
arrêtés
par
ordre
du
ministre
de
la
guerre
prétendent
n
avoir
jamais
eu
connaissance
de
l
existence
d
un
comité
dans
l
armée
et
n
avoir
jamais
servi
d
intermédiaire
entre
argenton
et
ce
comité
d
eux
le
capitaine
garde
toujours
la
même
attitude
lui
seul
dit
la
vérité
et
il
s
étonne
du
peu
de
mémoire
des
colonels
traduit
devant
un
conseil
de
guerre
le
décembre
le
capitaine
argenton
se
retranche
toujours
derrière
les
mêmes
moyens
de
défense
et
produit
les
mêmes
arguments
il
a
agi
par
ordre
verbal
il
est
vrai
et
il
a
cru
servir
à
la
fois
les
intérêts
de
l
armée
qu
il
a
sauvée
et
ceux
de
l
empereur
malgré
une
plaidoirie
très
éloquente
et
très
habile
de
son
défenseur
falconnet
qui
pour
défendre
son
client
n
épargne
pas
le
duc
de
dalmatie
argenton
est
condamné
à
mort
jusqu
à
la
dernière
heure
il
proteste
de
la
pureté
de
ses
intentions
et
maintient
qu
il
a
toujours
dit
la
vérité
et
qu
il
est
victime
de
l
égoïsme
de
ceux
qui
l
ont
fait
agir
avec
une
calme
résignation
il
commande
son
peloton
d
exécution

romanesque

de
présenter
à
votre

quelques
observations
sur
la
situation
actuelle
de
galice
cette
province
est
toujours
en
état
de
fermentation
les
menaces
de
mort
et
d
incendie
qu
employe
la
romana
les
nombreux
agents
qui
agissent
en
son
nom
les
exécutions
qu
il
fait
les
dévastations
qui
ont
inévitablement
lieu
par
les
fréquents
mouvements
des
troupes
la
ruine
de
la
plupart
des
habitants
l
absence
de
toute
autorité
qui
représente
votre
majesté
l
influence
des
prêtres
qui
sont
et
la
grande
majorité
opposante
l
argent
que
les
anglais
répandent
la
détresse
des
généraux
français
qui
faute
des
moyens
ne
peuvent
souvent
payer
les
émissaires
qu
ils
employent
toutes
ces
causes
contribuent
à
augmenter
de
jour
en
jour
le
nombre
des
ennemis
et
à
rendre
la
guerre
qu
on
fait
dans
ce
pays
infiniment
désagréable
et
d
un
résultat
fort
éloigné
on
s
y
battra
encore
longtemps
avant
que
votre
majesté
en
retire
quelque
avantage
à
moins
qu
elle
n
adopte
le
système
de
faire
fortifier
sept
à
huit
postes
importants
susceptibles
de
contenir
chacun
à
hommes
de
garnison
un
hôpital
et
des
vivres
pour
quatre
mois
pour
maintenir
la
population
fermer
et
garder
les
principaux
débouchés
dont
l
ennemi
ne
pourrait
plus
profiter
et
aussi
pour
offrir
aux
colonnes
qui
agiraient
dans
la
province
des
appuis
quelque
direction
qu
elles
suivissent
ainsi
elles
pourraient
recevoir
des
secours
et
déposer
leurs
malades
cette
dernière
considération
est
et
je
ne
dois
pas
dissimuler
à
votre
majesté
qu
elle
fait
beaucoup
sur
le
moral
des
soldats
qui
dans
l
état
actuel
des
choses
sont
exposés
à
périr
de
misère
ou
sous
les
coups
des
paysans
s
ils
ont
le
malheur
d
être
blessés
ou
atteints
de
la
fièvre
et
de
se
trouver
éloignés
d
un
lieu
sûr
pour
y
chercher
des
secours
je
crois
qu
avec
une
dépense
d
un
million
on
parviendrait
à
mettre
en
état
de
défense
la
galice
et
certes
jamais
argent
n
aurait
été
mieux
employé
d
autant
plus
que
par
la
suite
on
pourrait
diminuer
le
nombre
des
troupes
qui
pour
le
moment
y
sont
nécessaires
dans
cette
persuasion
j
ai
engagé
le
maréchal
ney
à
faire
fortifier
lugo
et
à
ordonner
la
construction
de
trois
blocus
sur
la
ligne
de
villa
franca
les
places
de
tuy
de
monterey
de
viana
et
de
puebla
de
sanabria
qui
toutes
peuvent
contenir
des
canons
ont
une
enceinte
et
un
reste
de
fortification
pourraient
aisément
être
rétablies
et
rempliraient
parfaitement
cet
objet
et
s
il
le
fallait
il
est
encore
d
autres
postes
qui
par
leur
situation
seraient
à
même
de
concourir
à
la
défense
sans
que
les
frais
fussent
considérablement
augmentés
si
cette
mesure
que
je
considère
comme
urgente
et
d
un
résultat
assuré
n
est
point
adoptée
il
deviendra
nécessaire
que
des
renforts
soient
envoyés
à
le
maréchal
ney
ne
fusse
que
pour
remplacer
ses
pertes
et
maintenir
libres
les
communications
quoique
aujourd
hui
il
puisse
être
assez
fort
pour
tenir
tête
au
corps
de
la
romana
et
de
carrera
réunis
s
ils
se
présentaient
en
ligne
mais
leur
système
étant
d
harceler
sans
cesse
et
d
éviter
une
affaire
générale
avec
le
temps
ils
auraient
l
avance
la
plus
forte
et
ils
finiraient
même
sans
combattre
par
le
détruire
s
il
n
était
soutenu
et
on
ferait
une
perte
d
hommes
incalculable
sans
obtenir
le
résultat
qu
on
se
propose
il
est
probable
que
je
ne
serai
plus
dans
le
cas
d
entretenir
votre
majesté
au
sujet
de
la
galice
ainsi
pour
cette
