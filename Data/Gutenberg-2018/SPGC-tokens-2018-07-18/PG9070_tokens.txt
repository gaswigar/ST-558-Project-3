looking
at
you
ang
toinette
toi
well
what
toinette
ang
do
you
guess
what
i
want
to
speak
about
toi
oh
yes
i
have
some
slight
idea
that
you
want
to
speak
of
our
young
lover
for
it
is
of
him
we
have
been
speaking
for
the
last
six
days
and
you
are
not
well
unless
you
mention
him
at
every
turn
ang
since
you
know
what
it
is
i
want
why
are
you
not
the
first
to
speak
to
me
of
him
and
why
do
you
not
spare
me
the
trouble
of
being
the
one
to
start
the
conversation
toi
you
do
give
me
time
and
you
are
so
eager
that
it
is
difficult
to
be
beforehand
with
you
on
the
subject
ang
i
acknowledge
that
i
am
never
weary
of
speaking
of
him
and
that
my
heart
takes
eager
advantage
of
every
moment
i
have
to
open
my
heart
to
you
but
tell
me
toinette
do
you
blame
the
feelings
i
have
towards
him
toi
i
am
far
from
doing
so
ang
am
i
wrong
in
giving
way
to
these
sweet
impressions
toi
i
do
say
that
you
are
ang
and
would
you
have
me
insensible
to
the
tender
protestations
of
ardent
love
which
he
shows
me
toi
heaven
forbid
ang
tell
me
do
you
not
see
as
i
do
something
providential
some
act
of
destiny
in
the
unexpected
adventure
from
which
our
acquaintance
originated
toi
yes
ang
that
it
is
impossible
to
act
more
generously
toi
agreed
ang
and
that
he
did
all
this
with
the
greatest
possible
grace
toi
oh
yes
ang
do
you
not
think
toinette
that
he
is
very
handsome
toi
certainly
ang
that
he
has
the
best
manners
in
the
world
toi
no
doubt
about
it
ang
that
there
is
always
something
noble
in
what
he
says
and
what
he
does
toi
most
certainly
ang
that
there
never
was
anything
more
tender
than
all
he
says
to
me
toi
true
arg
and
that
there
can
be
nothing
more
painful
than
the
restraint
under
which
i
am
kept
for
it
prevents
all
sweet
intercourse
and
puts
an
end
to
that
mutual
love
with
which
heaven
has
inspired
us
toi
you
are
right
ang
but
dear
toinette
tell
me
do
you
think
that
he
loves
me
as
much
as
he
says
he
does
toi
hum
that
a
thing
hardly
to
be
trusted
at
any
time
a
show
of
love
is
sadly
like
the
real
thing
and
i
have
met
with
very
good
actors
in
that
line
ang
ah
toinette
what
are
you
saying
there
alas
judging
by
the
manner
in
which
he
speaks
is
it
possible
that
he
is
not
telling
the
truth
toi
at
any
rate
you
will
soon
be
satisfied
on
this
point
and
the
resolution
which
he
says
he
has
taken
of
asking
you
in
marriage
is
a
sure
and
ready
way
of
showing
you
if
what
he
says
is
true
or
not
that
is
the
proof
ang
ah
toinette
if
he
deceives
me
i
shall
never
in
all
my
life
believe
in
any
man
toi
here
is
your
father
coming
back
scene

see

need
of
my
asking
you
if
you
are
willing
to
marry
ang
i
ought
to
obey
you
in
everything
father
arg
i

her
reasons

will
be
satisfied
ang
most
certainly
father
arg
how
have

me
to
open
my
heart
to
you
i
will
not
hide
from
you
that
chance
made
us
acquainted
six
days
ago
and
that
the
request
which
has
been
made
to
you
is
the
result
of
the
sympathy
we
felt
for
one
another
at
first
sight
arg
they
did
not
tell
me
that
but
i
am
glad
of
it
it
is
much
better
that
things
should
be
so
they
say
that
he
is
a
tall
young
fellow
ang
yes
father
arg
of
a
fine
build

in
three
days
be
made
a
doctor
ang
he
father
arg

he
not
tell
you
ang
no
indeed
who
told
you
arg
purgon
ang
does
purgon

a
question

him
since
he
is
his

cléante

the
nephew
of
purgon
arg
what
cléante
we
are
speaking
about
him
who
has
asked
you
in
marriage
ang
yes
of
course
arg
well
he
is
the
nephew
of
purgon
and
the
son
of
his
diafoirus
and
this
son
is
called
thomas
diafoirus
and
not
cléante
fleurant
and
i
decided
upon
this
match
this
morning
and
this
future
will
be
brought
to
me
by
his
father
what
is
the
matter
you
look
all
scared
ang
it
is
because
father
i
see
that
you
have
been
speaking
of
one
person
and
i
of
another
toi
what
sir
you
have
formed
such
a
queer
project
as
that
and
with
all
the
wealth
you
possess
you
want
to
marry
your
daughter
to
a
doctor
arg
what
business
is
it
of
yours
you
impudent
jade
toi
gently
gently
you
always
begin
by
abuse
can
we
not
reason
together
without
getting
into
a
rage
come
let
us
speak
quietly
what
reason
have
you
if
you
please
for
such
a
marriage
arg
my
reason
is
that
seeing
myself
infirm
and
sick
i
wish
to
have
a
and
relatives
who
are
doctors
in
order
to
secure
their
kind
assistance
in
my
illness
to
have
in
my
family
the
of
those
remedies
which
are
necessary
to
me
and
to
be
within
reach
of
consultations
and
prescriptions
toi
very
well
at
least
that
is
giving
a
reason
and
there
is
a
certain
pleasure
in
answering
one
another
calmly
but
now
sir
on
your
conscience
do
you
really
and
truly
believe
that
you
are
ill
arg
believe
that
i
am
ill
you
jade
believe
that
i
am
ill
you
impudent
hussy
toi
very
well
then
sir
you
are
ill
do
let
us
quarrel
about
that
yes
you
are
very
ill
i
agree
with
you
upon
that
point
more
ill
even
than
you
think
now
is
that
settled
but
your
daughter
is
to
marry
a
husband
for
herself
and
as
she
is
not
ill
what
is
the
use
of
giving
her
a
doctor
arg
it
is
for
my
sake
that
i
give
her
this
doctor
and
a
good
daughter
ought
to
be
delighted
to
marry
for
the
sake
of
her
health
toi
in
good
troth
sir
shall
i
as
a
friend
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
arg
what
is
this
advice
toi
not
to
think
of
this
match
arg
and
your
reason
toi
the
reason
is
that
your
daughter
will
never
consent
to
it
arg
my
daughter
will
not
consent
to
it
toi
no
arg
my
daughter
toi
your
daughter
she
will
tell
you
that
she
has
no
need
of
diafoirus
nor
of
his
son
thomas
diafoirus
nor
all
the
diafoiruses
in
the
world
arg
but
i
have
need
of
them
besides
the
match
is
more
advantageous
than
you
think
diafoirus
has
only
this
son
for
his
heir
and
moreover
purgon
who
has
neither
wife
nor
child
gives
all
he
has
in
favour
of
this
marriage
and
purgon
is
a
man
worth
eight
thousand
francs
a
year
toi
what
a
lot
of
people
he
must
have
killed
to
have
become
so
rich
arg
eight
thousand
francs
is
something
without
counting
the
property
of
the
father
toi
that
is
very
well
sir
but
all
the
same
i
advise
you
between
ourselves
to
choose
another
husband
for
her
she
is
not
of
a
make
to
become
a
diafoirus
arg
but
i
will
have
it
so
toi
fie
nonsense
do
speak
like
that
arg
do
speak
like
that
why
not
toi
dear
me
no
do
arg
and
why
should
i
not
speak
like
that
toi
people
will
say
that
you
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
arg
people
will
say
all
they
like
but
i
tell
you
that
i
will
have
her
make
my
promise
good
toi
i
feel
sure
that
she
wo
arg
then
i
will
force
her
to
do
it
toi
she
will
not
do
it
i
tell
you
arg
she
will
or
i

take
a

if
you
please
my
wife
tells
me
sir
that
you
are
a
very
honest
man
and
altogether
one
of
her
friends
i
have
therefore
asked
her
to
speak
to
you
about
a
will
which
i
wish
to
make
bel
alas
i
can
not
speak
of
those
things
de
bon
she
has
fully
explained
to
me
your
intentions
sir
and
what
you
mean
to
do
for
her
but
i
have
to
tell
you
that
you
can
give
nothing
to
your
wife
by
will
arg
but
why
so
de
bon
it
is
against
custom
if
you
were
in
a
district
where
statute
law
prevailed
the
thing
could
be
done
but
in
paris
and
in
almost
all
places
governed
by
custom
it
can
not
be
done
and
the
will
would
be
held
void
the
only
settlement
that
man
and
wife
can
make
on
each
other
is
by
mutual
donation
while
they
are
alive
and
even
then
there
must
be
no
children
from
either
that
marriage
or
from
any
previous
marriage
at
the
decease
of
the
first
who
dies
arg
it
a
very
impertinent
custom
that
a
husband
can
leave
nothing
to
a
wife
whom
he
loves
by
whom
he
is
tenderly
loved
and
who
takes
so
much
care
of
him
i
should
like
to
consult
my
own
advocate
to
see
what
i
can
do
de
bon
it
is
not
to
an
advocate
that
you
must
apply
for
they
are
very
particular
on
this
point
and
think
it
a
great
crime
to
bestow
one
property
contrary
to
the
law
they
are
people
to
make
difficulties
and
are
ignorant
of
the
bylaws
of
conscience
there
are
others
whom
you
may
consult
with
advantage
on
that
point
and
who
have
expedients
for
gently
overriding
the
law
and
for
rendering
just
that
which
is
not
allowed
these
know
how
to
smooth
over
the
difficulties
of
an
affair
and
to
find
the
means
of
eluding
custom
by
some
indirect
advantage
without
that
what
would
become
of
us
every
day
we
must
make
things
easy
otherwise
we
should
do
nothing
and
i
would
give
a
penny
for
our
business

my

had
rightly
told
me

you
were

very
clever

honest
man

can

do
pray
to
give
her
my
fortune

deprive
my

what
you
can
do
you
can
discreetly
choose
a

you
will
give
all
you
own
in

form
by
your
will

lend
their

rapture

say
fine
things

cléante
well
what
do
you
say
to
that
cle
the
gentleman
does
wonders
and
if
he
is
as
good
a
doctor
as
he
is
an
orator
it
will
be
most
pleasant
to
be
one
of
his
patients
toi
certainly
it
will
be
something
admirable
if
his
cures
are
as
wonderful
as
his
speeches
arg
now
quick
my
chair
and
seats
for
everybody
bring
sit
down
here
my
daughter
diafoirus
you
see
sir
that
everybody
admires
your
son
and
i
think
you
very
fortunate
in
being
the
father
of
such
a
fine
young
man
dia
sir
it
is
not
because
i
am
his
father
but
i
can
boast
that
i
have
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
him
and
that
all
those
who
see
him
speak
of
him
as
of
a
youth
without
guile
he
has
not
a
very
lively
imagination
nor
that
sparkling
wit
which
is
found
in
some
others
but
it
is
this
which
has
always
made
me
augur
well
of
his
judgment
a
quality
required
for
the
exercise
of
our
art
as
a
child
he
never
was
what
is
called
sharp
or
lively
he
was
always
gentle
peaceful
taciturn
never
saying
a
word
and
never
playing
at
any
of
those
little
pastimes
that
we
call
children
games
it
was
found
most
difficult
to
teach
him
to
read
and
he
was
nine
years
old
before
he
knew
his
letters
a
good
omen
i
used
to
say
to
myself
trees
slow
of
growth
bear
the
best
fruit
we
engrave
on
marble
with
much
more
difficulty
than
on
sand
but
the
result
is
more
lasting
and
that
dulness
of
apprehension
that
heaviness
of
imagination
is
a
mark
of
a
sound
judgment
in
the
future
when
i
sent
him
to
college
he
found
it
hard
work
but
he
stuck
to
his
duty
and
bore
up
with
obstinacy
against
all
difficulties
his
tutors
always
praised
him
for
his
assiduity
and
the
trouble
he
took
in
short
by
dint
of
continual
hammering
he
at
last
succeeded
gloriously
in
obtaining
his
degree
and
i
can
say
without
vanity
that
from
that
time
till
now
there
has
been
no
candidate
who
has
made
more
noise
than
he
in
all
the
disputations
of
our
school
there
he
has
rendered
himself
formidable
and
no
debate
passes
but
he
goes
and
argues
loudly
and
to
the
last
extreme
on
the
opposite
side
he
is
firm
in
dispute
strong
as
a
turk
in
his
principles
never
changes
his
opinion
and
pursues
an
argument
to
the
last
recesses
of
logic
but
above
all
things
what
pleases
me
in
him
and
what
i
am
glad
to
see
him
follow
my
example
in
is
that
he
is
blindly
attached
to
the
opinions
of
the
ancients
and
that
he
would
never
understand
nor
listen
to
the
reasons
and
the
experiences
of
the
pretended
discoveries
of
our
century
concerning
the
circulation
of
the
blood
and
other
opinions
of
the
same
stamp
dia
out
of
his
pocket
a
long
paper
rolled
up
and
presenting
it
angélique
i
have
upheld
against
these
circulators
a
thesis
which
with
the
permission
argan
of
this
gentleman
i
venture
to
present
to
the
young
lady
as
the
of
my
genius
ang
sir
it
is
a
useless
piece
of
furniture
to
me
i
do
not
understand
these
things
toi
the
never
mind
give
it
all
the
same
the
picture
will
be
of
use
and
we
will
adorn
our
attic
with
it
dia
bowing
angélique
with
the
permission
of
this
gentleman
i
invite
you
to
come
one
of
these
days
to
amuse
yourself
by
assisting
at
the
dissection
of
a
woman
upon
whose
body
i
am
to
give
lectures
toi
the
treat
will
be
most
welcome
there
are
some
who
give
the
pleasure
of
seeing
a
play
to
their
but
a
dissection
is
much
more
gallant
dia
moreover
in
respect
to
the
qualities
required
for
marriage
i
assure
you
that
he
is
all
you
could
wish
and
that
his
children
will
be
strong
and
healthy
arg
do
you
not
intend
sir
to
push
his
way
at
court
and
obtain
for
him
the
post
of
physician
there
dia
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
have
never
had
any
predilection
to
practice
with
the
great
it
never
seemed
pleasant
to
me
and
i
have
found
that
it
is
better
for
us
to
confine
ourselves
to
the
ordinary
public
ordinary
people
are
more
convenient
you
are
accountable
to
nobody
for
your
actions
and
as
long
as
you
follow
the
common
rules
laid
down
by
the
faculty
there
is
no
necessity
to
trouble
yourself
about
the
result
what
is
vexatious
among
people
of
rank
is
that
when
they
are
ill
they
positively
expect
their
doctor
to
cure
them
toi
how
very
absurd
how
impertinent
of
them
to
ask
of
you
doctors
to
cure
them
you
are
not
placed
near
them
for
that
but
only
to
receive
your
fees
and
to
prescribe
remedies
it
is
their
own
to
get
well
if
they
can
dia
quite
so
we
are
only
bound
to
treat
people
according
to
form
arg
cléante
sir
please
make
my
daughter
sing
before
the
company
cle
i
was
waiting
for
your
commands
sir
and
i
propose
in
order
to
amuse
the
company
to
sing
with
the
young
lady
an
operetta
which
has
lately
come
out
angélique
her
a
there
is
your
part
ang
mine
cle
angélique
do
refuse
pray
but
let
me
explain
to
you
what
is
the
scene
we
must
sing
i
have
no
voice
but
in
this
case
it
is
sufficient
if
i
make
myself
understood
and
you
must
have
the
goodness
to
excuse
me
because
i
am
under
the
necessity
of
making
the
young
lady
sing
arg
are
the
verses
pretty
cle
it
is
really
nothing
but
a
small
extempore
opera
and
what
you
will
hear
is
only
rhythmical
prose
or
a
kind
of
irregular
verse
such
as
passion
and
necessity
make
two
people
utter
arg
very
well
let
us
hear
cle
the
subject
of
the
scene
is
as
follows
a
shepherd
was
paying
every
attention
to
the
beauties
of
a
play
when
he
was
disturbed
by
a
noise
close
to
him
and
on
turning
round
he
saw
a
scoundrel
who
with
insolent
language
was
annoying
a
young
shepherdess
he
immediately
espoused
the
cause
of
a
sex
to
which
all
men
owe
homage
and
after
having
chastised
the
brute
for
his
insolence
he
came
near
the
shepherdess
to
comfort
her
he
sees
a
young
girl
with
the
most
beautiful
eyes
he
has
ever
beheld
who
is
shedding
tears
which
he
thinks
the
most
precious
in
the
world
alas
says
he
to
himself
can
any
one
be
capable
of
insulting
such
charms
where
is
the
unfeeling
wretch
the
barbarous
man
to
be
found
who
will
not
feel
touched
by
such
tears
he
endeavours
to
stop
those
beautiful
tears
and
the
lovely
shepherdess
takes
the
opportunity
of
thanking
him
for
the
slight
service
he
has
rendered
her
but
she
does
it
in
a
manner
so
touching
so
tender
and
so
passionate
that
the
shepherd
can
not
resist
it
and
each
word
each
look
is
a
burning
shaft
which
penetrates
his
heart
is
there
anything
in
the
world
worthy
of
such
thanks
and
what
will
not
one
do
what
service
and
what
danger
will
not
one
be
delighted
to
run
to
attract
upon
oneself
even
for
a
moment
the
touching
sweetness
of
so
grateful
a
heart
the
whole
play
was
acted
without
his
paying
any
more
attention
to
it
yet
he
complains
that
it
was
too
short
since
the
end
separates
him
from
his
lovely
shepherdess
from
that
moment
from
that
first
sight
he
carries
away
with
him
a
love
which
has
the
strength
of
a
passion
of
many
years
he
now
feels
all
the
pangs
of
absence
and
is
tormented
in
no
longer
seeing
what
he
beheld
for
so
short
a
time
he
tries
every
means
to
meet
again
with
a
sight
so
dear
to
him
and
the
remembrance
of
which
pursues
him
day
and
night
but
the
great
watch
which
is
kept
over
his
shepherdess
deprives
him
of
all
the
power
of
doing
so
the
violence
of
his
passion
urges
him
to
ask
in
marriage
the
adorable
beauty
without
whom
he
can
no
longer
live
and
he
obtains
from
her
the
permission
of
doing
so
by
means
of
a
note
that
he
has
succeeded
in
sending
to
her
but
he
is
told
in
the
meantime
that
the
father
of
her
whom
he
loves
has
decided
upon
marrying
her
to
another
and
that
everything
is
being
got
ready
to
celebrate
the
wedding
judge
what
a
cruel
wound
for
the
heart
of
that
poor
shepherd
behold
him
suffering
from
this
mortal
blow
he
can
not
bear
the
dreadful
idea
of
seeing
her
he
loves
in
the
arms
of
another
and
in
his
despair
he
finds
the
means
of
introducing
himself
into
the
house
of
his
shepherdess
in
order
to
learn
her
feelings
and
to
hear
from
her
the
fate
he
must
expect
there
he
sees
everything
ready
for
what
he
fears
he
sees
the
unworthy
rival
whom
the
caprice
of
a
father
opposes
to
the
tenderness
of
his
love
he
sees
that
ridiculous
rival
triumphant
near
the
lovely
shepherdess
as
if
already
assured
of
his
conquest
such
a
sight
fills
him
with
a
wrath
he
can
hardly
master
he
looks
despairingly
at
her
whom
he
adores
but
the
respect
he
has
for
her
and
the
presence
of
her
father
prevent
him
from
speaking
except
with
his
eyes
at

ah
and
where
are
the
words
that
you
have
just
sung
this
is
only
the
music
cle
are
you
not
aware
sir
that
the
way
of
writing
the
words
with
the
notes
themselves
has
been
lately
discovered
arg
has
it
for
the
present
we
could
have
done
very
well
without
your
impertinent
opera

foolish

diafoirus
toinette
arg
my
love
here
is
the
son
of
diafoirus
dia
madam
it
is
with
justice
that
heaven
has
given
you
the
title
of
stepmother
since
we
see
in
you
steps
bel
sir
i
am
delighted
to
have
come
here
just
in
time
to
see
you
dia
since
we
see
in
you
since
we
see
in
you
madam
you
have
interrupted
me
in
the
middle
of
my
period
and
have
troubled
my
memory
dia
keep
it
for
another
time
arg
i
wish
my
dear
that
you
had
been
here
just
now
toi
ah
madam
how
much
you
have
lost
by
not
being
at
the
second
father
the
statue
of
memnon
and
the
flower
styled
heliotrope
arg
come
my
daughter
shake
hands
with
this
gentleman
and
pledge
him
your
troth
ang
father
arg
well
what
do
you
mean
by
father
ang
i
beseech
you
not
to
be
in
such
a
hurry
give
us
time
to
become
acquainted
with
each
other
and
to
see
grow
in
us
that
sympathy
so
necessary
to
a
perfect
union
dia
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
madam
it
is
already
within
me
and
there
is
no
occasion
for
me
to
wait
ang
i
am
not
so
quick
as
you
are
sir
and
i
must
confess
that
your
merit
has
not
yet
made
enough
impression
on
my
heart
arg
oh
nonsense
there
will
be
time
enough
for
the
impression
to
be
made
after
you
are
married
ang
ah
my
father
give
me
time
i
beseech
you
marriage
is
a
chain
which
should
never
be
imposed
by
force
and
if
this
gentleman
is
a
man
of
honour
he
ought
not
to
accept
a
person
who
would
be
his
only
by
force
dia
i
can
be
a
man
of
honour
madam
and
at
the
same
time
accept
you
from
the
hands
of
your
father
ang
to
do
violence
to
any
one
is
a
strange
way
of
setting
about
inspiring
love
dia
we
read
in
the
ancients
madam
that
it
was
their
custom
to
carry
off
by
main
force
from
their
father
house
the
maiden
they
wished
to
marry
so
that
the
latter
might
not
seem
to
fly
of
her
own
accord
into
the
arms
of
a
man
ang
the
ancients
sir
are
the
ancients
but
we
are
the
moderns
pretences
are
not
necessary
in
our
age
and
when
a
marriage
pleases
us
we
know
very
well
how
to
go
to
it
without
being
dragged
by
force
have
a
little
patience
if
you
love
me
sir
you
ought
to
do
what
i
wish
dia
certainly
madam
but
without
prejudice
to
the
interest
of
my
love
ang
but
the
greatest
mark
of
love
is
to
submit
to
the
will
of
her
who
is
loved
dia
madam
in
what
does
not
regard
the
possession
of
her
but
in
what
regards
it
toi
to
angélique
it
is
in
vain
for
you
to
argue
this
gentleman
is
bran
new
from
college
and
will
be
more
than
a
match
for
you
why
resist
and
refuse
the
glory
of
belonging
to
the
faculty
bel
she
may
have
some
other
inclination
in
her
head
ang
if
i
had
madam
it
would
be
such
as
reason
and
honour
allow
arg
heyday
i
am
acting
a
pleasant
part
here
bel
if
i
were
you
my
child
i
would
not
force
her
to
marry
i
know
very
well
what
i
should
do
ang
i
know
what
you
mean
madam
and
how
kind
you
are
to
me
but
it
may
be
hoped
that
your
advice
may
not
be
fortunate
enough
to
be
followed
bel
that
is
because
and
good
children
like
you
scorn
to
be
obedient
to
the
will
of
their
fathers
obedience
was
all
very
well
in
former
times
ang
the
duty
of
a
daughter
has
its
limits
madam
and
neither
reason
nor
law
extend
it
to
all
things
bel
which
means
that
your
thoughts
are
all
in
favour
of
marriage
but
that
you
will
choose
a
husband
for
yourself
ang
if
my
father
will
not
give
me
a
husband
i
like
at
least
i
beseech
him
not
to
force
me
to
marry
one
i
can
never
love
arg
gentlemen
i
beg
your
pardon
for
all
this
ang
we
all
have
our
own
end
in
marrying
for
my
part
as
i
only
want
a
husband
that
i
can
love
sincerely
and
as
i
intend
to
consecrate
my
whole
life
to
him
i
feel
bound
i
confess
to
be
cautious
there
are
some
who
marry
simply
to
free
themselves
from
the
yoke
of
their
parents
and
to
be
at
liberty
to
do
all
they
like
there
are
others
madam
who
see
in
marriage
only
a
matter
of
mere
interest
who
marry
only
to
get
a
settlement
and
to
enrich
themselves
by
the
death
of
those
they
marry
they
pass
without
scruple
from
husband
to
husband
with
an
eye
to
their
possessions
these
no
doubt
madam
are
not
so
difficult
to
satisfy
and
care
little
what
the
husband
is
like
bel
you
are
very
full
of
reasoning
i
wonder
what
you
mean
by
this
ang
i
madam
what
can
i
mean
but
what
i
say
bel
you
are
such
a
simpleton
my
dear
that
one
can
hardly
bear
with
you
ang
you
would
like
to
extract
from
me
some
rude
answer
but
i
warn
you
that
you
will
not
have
the
pleasure
of
doing
so
bel
nothing
can
equal
your
impertinence
ang
it
is
of
no
use
madam
you
will
not
bel
and
you
have
a
ridiculous
pride
an
impertinent
presumption
which
makes
you
the
scorn
of
everybody
ang
all
this
will
be
useless
madam
i
shall
be
quiet
in
spite
of
you
and
to
take
away
from
you
all
hope
of
succeeding
in
what
you

may
see
whether
you
can
form
a
right
judgment
on

pulse

the
pulse

forward
her

we
must
prevent
this
foolish
marriage
which
he
has
got
into
his

from
taking
place

i
thought
to
myself
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
introduce
a
doctor
here
having
a
full
understanding
of
our
wishes

disgust
him

abuse
his
mode
of
treating
him

as
we
have
nobody

part

have
decided
upon
playing
him
a
trick

my

ber
in

way
toi
it
is
rather
an
absurd
idea

it

me
ask
you

above
all
things
not
to
excite
yourself

conversation

i
agree

to
answer
without
anger
to
anything
i
may
mention
arg
very
well
ber
and
to
reason
together
upon
the
business
i
want
to
discuss
with
you
without
any
irritation
arg
dear
me
yes
what
a
preamble
ber
how
is
it
brother
that
with
all
the
wealth
you
possess
and
with
only
one
daughter
for
i
do
not
count
the
little
one
you
speak
of
sending
her
to
a
convent
arg
how
is
it
brother
that
i
am
master
of
my
family
and
that
i
can
do
all
i
think
fit
ber
your
wife
does
fail
to
advise
you
to
get
rid
in
that
way
of
your
two
daughters
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
through
a
spirit
of
charity
she
would
be
charmed
to
see
them
both
good
nuns
arg
oh
i
see
my
poor
wife
again
it
is
she
who
does
all
the
harm
and
everybody
is
against
her
ber
no
brother
let
us
leave
that
alone
she
is
a
woman
with
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
for
the
good
of
your
family
and
is
free
from
all
interested
motives
she
expresses
for
you
the
most
extraordinary
tenderness
and
shows
towards
your
children
an
inconceivable
goodness
no
do
let
us
speak
of
her
but
only
of
your
daughter
what
can
be
your
reason
for
wishing
to
give
her
in
marriage
to
the
sort
of
a
doctor
arg
my
reason
is
that
i
wish
to
have
a
who
will
suit
my
wants
ber
but
it
is
not
what
your
daughter
requires
and
we
have
a
more
suitable
match
for
her
arg
yes
but
this
one
is
more
suitable
for
me
ber
but
does
she
marry
a
husband
for
herself
or
for
you
brother
arg
he
must
do
both
for
her
and
for
me
brother
and
i
wish
to
take
into
my
family
people
of
whom
i
have
need
ber
so
that
if
your
little
girl
were
old
enough
you
would
give
her
to
an
apothecary
arg
why
not
ber
is
it
possible
that
you
should
always
be
so
infatuated
with
your
apothecaries
and
doctors
and
be
so
determined
to
be
ill
in
spite
of
men
and
nature
arg
what
do
you
mean
by
that
brother
ber
i
mean
brother
that
i
know
of
no
man
less
sick
than
you
and
that
i
should
be
quite
satisfied
with
a
constitution
no
worse
than
yours
one
great
proof
that
you
are
well
and
that
you
have
a
body
perfectly
well
made
is
that
with
all
the
pains
you
have
taken
you
have
failed
as
yet
in
injuring
the
soundness
of
your
constitution
and
that
you
have
not
died
of
all
the
medicine
they
have
made
you
swallow
arg
but
are
you
aware
brother
that
it
is
these
medicines
which
keep
me
in
good
health
purgon
says
that
i
should
go
off
if
he
were
but
three
days
without
taking
care
of
me
ber
if
you
are
not
careful
he
will
take
such
care
of
you
that
he
will
soon
send
you
into
the
next
world
arg
but
let
us
reason
together
brother
do
you
believe
at
all
in
medicine
ber
no
brother
and
i
do
not
see
that
it
is
necessary
for
our
salvation
to
believe
in
it
arg
what
do
you
not
hold
true
a
thing
acknowledged
by
everybody
and
revered
throughout
all
ages
ber
between
ourselves
far
from
thinking
it
true
i
look
upon
it
as
one
of
the
greatest
follies
which
exist
among
men
and
to
consider
things
from
a
philosophical
point
of
view
i
do
know
of
a
more
absurd
piece
of
mummery
of
anything
more
ridiculous
than
a
man
who
takes
upon
himself
to
cure
another
man
arg
why
will
you
not
believe
that
a
man
can
cure
another
ber
for
the
simple
reason
brother
that
the
springs
of
our
machines
are
mysteries
about
which
men
are
as
yet
completely
in
the
dark
and
nature
has
put
too
thick
a
veil
before
our
eyes
for
us
to
know
anything
about
it
arg
then
according
to
you
the
doctors
know
nothing
at
all
ber
oh
yes
brother
most
of
them
have
some
knowledge
of
the
best
classics
can
talk
fine
latin
can
give
a
greek
name
to
every
disease
can
define
and
distinguish
them
but
as
to
curing
these
diseases
that
out
of
the
question
arg
still
you
must
agree
to
this
that
doctors
know
more
than
others
ber
they
know
brother
what
i
have
told
you
and
that
does
not
effect
many
cures
all
the
excellency
of
their
art
consists
in
pompous
gibberish
in
a
specious
babbling
which
gives
you
words
instead
of
reasons
and
promises
instead
of
results
arg
still
brother
there
exist
men
as
wise
and
clever
as
you
and
we
see
that
in
cases
of
illness
every
one
has
recourse
to
the
doctor
ber
it
is
a
proof
of
human
weakness
and
not
of
the
truth
of
their
art
arg
still
doctors
must
believe
in
their
art
since
they
make
use
of
it
for
themselves
ber
it
is
because
some
of
them
share
the
popular
error
by
which
they
themselves
profit
while
others
profit
by
it
without
sharing
it
your
purgon
has
no
wish
to
deceive
he
is
a
thorough
doctor
from
head
to
foot
a
man
who
believes
in
his
rules
more
than
in
all
the
demonstrations
of
mathematics
and
who
would
think
it
a
crime
to
question
them
he
sees
nothing
obscure
in
physic
nothing
doubtful
nothing
difficult
and
through
an
impetuous
prepossession
an
obstinate
confidence
a
coarse
common
sense
and
reason
orders
right
and
left
purgatives
and
bleedings
and
hesitates
at
nothing
we
must
bear
him
no
for
the
harm
he
does
us
it
is
with
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
that
he
will
send
you
into
the
next
world
and
in
killing
you
he
will
do
no
more
than
he
has
done
to
his
wife
and
children
and
than
he
would
do
to
himself
if
need
be
arg
it
is
because
you
have
a
spite
against
him
but
let
us
come
to
the
point
what
is
to
be
done
when
one
is
ill
ber
nothing
brother
arg
nothing
ber
nothing
only
rest
nature
when
we
leave
her
free
will
herself
gently
recover
from
the
disorder
into
which
she
has
fallen
it
is
our
anxiety
our
impatience
which
does
the
mischief
and
most
men
die
of
their
remedies
and
not
of
their
diseases
arg
still
you
must
acknowledge
brother
that
we
can
in
certain
things
help
nature
ber
alas
brother
these
are
pure
fancies
with
which
we
deceive
ourselves
at
all
times
there
have
crept
among
men
brilliant
fancies
in
which
we
believe
because
they
flatter
us
and
because
it
would
be
well
if
they
were
true
when
a
doctor
speaks
to
us
of
assisting
succouring
nature
of
removing
what
is
injurious
to
it
of
giving
it
what
it
is
defective
in
of
restoring
it
and
giving
back
to
it
the
full
exercise
of
its
functions
when
he
speaks
of
purifying
the
blood
of
refreshing
the
bowels
and
the
brain
of
correcting
the
spleen
of
rebuilding
the
lungs
of
renovating
the
liver
of
fortifying
the
heart
of
and
keeping
up
the
natural
heat
and
of
possessing
secrets
wherewith
to
lengthen
life
of
many
years
he
repeats
to
you
the
romance
of
physic
but
when
you
test
the
truth
of
what
he
has
promised
to
you
you
find
that
it
all
ends
in
nothing
it
is
like
those
beautiful
dreams
which
only
leave
you
in
the
morning
the
regret
of
having
believed
in
them
arg
which
means
that
all
the
knowledge
of
the
world
is
contained
in
your
brain
and
that
you
think
you
know
more
than
all
the
great
doctors
of
our
age
put
together
ber
when
you
weigh
words
and
actions
your
great
doctors
are
two
different
kinds
of
people
listen
to
their
talk
they
are
the
cleverest
people
in
the
world
see
them
at
work
and
they
are
the
most
ignorant
arg
heyday
you
are
a
great
doctor
i
see
and
i
wish
that
some
one
of
those
gentlemen
were
here
to
take
up
your
arguments
and
to
check
your
babble
ber
i
do
not
take
upon
myself
brother
to
fight
against
physic
and
every
one
at
their
own
risk
and
peril
may
believe
what
he
likes
what
i
say
is
only
between
ourselves
and
i
should
have
liked
in
order
to
deliver
you
from
the
error
into
which
you
have
fallen
and
in
order
to
amuse
you
to
take
you
to
see
some
of
molière
comedies
on
this
subject
arg
your
molière
is
a
fine
impertinent
fellow
with
his
comedies
i
think
it
mightily
pleasant
of
him
to
go
and
take
off
honest
people
like
the
doctors
ber
it
is
not
the
doctors
themselves
that
he
takes
off
but
the
absurdity
of
medicine
arg
it
becomes
him
well
truly
to
control
the
faculty
he
a
nice
simpleton
and
a
nice
impertinent
fellow
to
laugh
at
consultations
and
prescriptions
to
attack
the
body
of
physicians
and
to
bring
on
his
stage
such
venerable
people
as
those
gentlemen
ber
what
would
you
have
him
bring
there
but
the
different
professions
of
men
princes
and
kings
are
brought
there
every
day
and
they
are
of
as
good
a
stock
as
your
physicians
arg
no
by
all
the
devils
if
i
were
a
physician
i
would
be
revenged
of
his
impertinence
and
when
he
falls
ill
i
would
let
him
die
without
relief
in
vain
would
he
beg
and
pray
i
would
not
prescribe
for
him
the
least
little
bleeding
the
least
little
injection
and
i
would
tell
him
die
die
like
a
dog
it
will
teach
you
to
laugh
at
us
doctors
ber
you
are
terribly
angry
with
him
arg
yes
he
is
an
fellow
and
if
the
doctors
are
wise
they
will
do
what
i
say
ber
he
will
be
wiser
than
the
doctors
for
he
will
not
go
and
ask
their
help
arg
so
much
the
worse
for
him
if
he
has
not
recourse
to
their
remedies
ber
he
has
his
reasons
for
not
wishing
to
have
anything
to
do
with
them
he
is
certain
that
only
strong
and
robust
constitutions
can
bear
their
remedies
in
addition
to
the
illness
and
he
has
only
just
enough
strength
for
his
sickness
arg
what
absurd
reasons
here
brother
do
speak
to
me
anymore
about
that
man
for
it
makes
me
savage
and
you
will
give
me
his
complaint
ber
i
will
willingly
cease
brother

to
change
the
subject
allow
me
to
tell
you
that
because
your
daughter
shows
a
slight
repugnance
to
the
match
you
propose
it
is
no
reason
why
you
should
shut
her
up

choice

should
not

follow
the
anger

you
we
should
in
such
a
matter
yield
a
little
to
the
inclinations
