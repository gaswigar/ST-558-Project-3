the
land
of
the
blue
flower
by
frances
hodgson
burnett
illustrated
part
one
the
land
of
the
blue
flower
was
not
called
by
that
name
until
the
tall
strong
beautiful
king
amor
came
down
from
his
castle
on
the
mountain
crag
and
began
to
reign
before
that
time
it
was
called
king
land
and
as
the
first
king
mordreth
had
been
a
fierce
and
cruel
king
this
seemed
a
gloomy
name
a
few
weeks
before
amor
was
born
his
weak
selfish
whose
name
was
king
mordreth
also
had
been
killed
while
hunting
and
his
fair
mother
with
the
clear
eyes
died
when
he
was
but
a
few
hours
old
but
early
in
that
day
she
sent
for
her
venerable
friend
and
teacher
who
was
said
to
be
the
oldest
and
wisest
man
in
the
world
and
who
long
ago
had
fled
to
a
cave
in
the
mountains
that
he
might
see
no
more
of
the
famine
and
disorder
and
hatred
in
the
country
spread
out
on
the
plains
below
he
was
a
marvelous
old
man
almost
a
giant
in
size
and
having
great
blue
eyes
like
deep
they
too
were
clear
eyes
like
the
fair
queen
they
seemed
to
see
all
things
and
to
hold
in
their
depths
no
single
thought
which
was
not
fine
and
great
the
people
were
a
little
afraid
of
him
when
they
saw
him
go
striding
majestically
through
their
streets
they
had
no
name
for
him
but
the
ancient
one
the
lovely
queen
drew
aside
the
embroidered
coverlet
of
her
gold
and
ivory
bed
and
showed
him
the
tiny
baby
sleeping
by
her
side
he
was
born
a
king
she
said
no
one
can
help
him
but
you
the
ancient
one
looked
down
at
him
he
has
long
limbs
and
strong
ones
he
will
make
a
great
king
he
said
give
him
to
me
the
queen
held
out
the
little
newborn
one
in
her
arms
take
him
away
quickly
before
he
hears
the
people
quarreling
at
the
palace
gate
she
said
take
him
to
the
castle
on
the
mountain
crag
keep
him
there
until
he
is
old
enough
to
come
down
and
be
king
when
the
sun
sinks
behind
the
clouds
i
shall
die
but
if
he
is
with
you
he
will
learn
what
kings
should
know
the
ancient
one
took
the
child
folded
him
in
his
long
gray
robe
and
strode
majestically
through
the
palace
gates
through
the
ugly
city
and
out
over
the
plains
to
the
mountain
when
he
began
to
climb
its
steep
sides
the
sun
was
setting
and
casting
a
golden
rose
color
over
the
big
rocks
and
the
wild
flowers
and
bushes
which
grew
on
every
side
so
that
there
seemed
no
path
to
be
found
but
the
ancient
one
knew
his
way
anywhere
in
the
world
without
a
path
to
guide
him
he
climbed
and
climbed
and
little
king
amor
slept
soundly
in
the
folds
of
his
gray
robe
he
reached
the
summit
at
last
and
pushing
his
way
through
a
jungle
of
twisted
vines
starred
all
over
with
pale
buds
he
stood
looking
at
the
castle
which
was
set
on
the
very
topmost
crag
and
looked
out
over
the
mountain
edge
at
the
sea
and
the
sky
and
the
spreading
plains
below
the
sky
was
dark
blue
now
and
lit
by
a
myriad
stars
and
all
was
so
still
that
the
world
seemed
thousands
of
miles
away
and
ugliness
and
squalor
and
people
who
quarreled
seemed
things
which
were
not
true
a
sweet
cool
wind
blew
about
them
as
the
ancient
one
took
king
amor
from
the
folds
of
his
gray
robe
and
laid
him
on
the
carpet
of
scented
moss
the
stars
are
very
near
he
said
waken
young
king
and
see
how
near
they
are
and
know
they
are
your
brothers
your
brother
the
wind
is
bringing
to
you
the
breath
of
your
brothers
the
trees
you
are
at
home
then
king
amor
opened
his
eyes
and
when
he
saw
the
stars
in
the
dark
blueness
above
him
he
smiled
and
though
he
was
not
yet
a
whole
day
old
he
threw
up
his
small
hand
and
it
touched
his
forehead
like
a
king
and
a
soldier
he
salutes
them
said
the
ancient
one
though
he
does
not
know
he
did
it
the
castle
was
huge
and
splendid
though
it
had
been
deserted
for
a
hundred
years
for
three
generations
the
royal
owners
had
not
cared
to
look
out
on
the
world
from
high
places
they
knew
nothing
of
the
wind
and
the
trees
and
the
stars
they
lived
on
the
plains
in
their
cities
and
hunted
and
rioted
and
levied
heavy
taxes
on
their
wretched
people
and
the
castle
had
lived
through
its
summers
and
winters
alone
it
had
battlements
and
towers
which
stood
out
clear
against
the
sky
and
there
was
a
great
banquet
hall
and
chambers
for
hundreds
of
guests
and
rooms
for
a
thousand
men
at
arms
and
the
courtyard
was
big
enough
to
hold
a
tournament
in
in
the
midst
of
its
space
and
splendor
the
little
king
amor
lived
alone
but
for
the
companionship
of
the
ancient
one
and
a
servant
as
old
as
himself
but
they
knew
a
secret
which
had
kept
them
young
in
spite
of
the
years
they
had
passed
through
they
knew
that
they
were
the
brothers
of
all
things
in
the
world
and
that
the
man
who
never
knows
an
angered
or
evil
thought
can
never
know
a
foe
they
were
strong
and
straight
and
wise
and
the
wildest
creature
stopped
to
give
them
greeting
as
it
passed
and
they
understood
its
language
when
it
spoke
because
they
held
no
dark
thoughts
in
their
minds
they
knew
no
fear
and
because
they
knew
no
fear
the
wild
creatures
knew
none
and
the
speech
of
each
was
clear
to
the
other
each
morning
they
went
out
on
the
battlements
at
dawn
to
see
the
splendid
sun
rise
slowly
out
of
the
purple
sea
one
of
the
very
first
things
the
child
king
amor
remembered
in
his
life
and
he
remembered
it
always
was
a
dawning
day
when
the
ancient
one
wakened
him
gently
and
folding
him
in
his
long
gray
robe
carried
him
up
the
winding
and
narrow
stone
stairway
until
at
last
they
stepped
forth
on
the
top
of
the
huge
castle
which
seemed
to
the
little
creature
to
be
so
high
that
it
was
quite
close
to
the
wonderful
sky
itself
the
sun
is
going
to
rise
and
wake
the
world
said
the
ancient
one
young
king
watch
the
wonder
of
it
amor
lifted
his
little
head
and
looked
he
was
only
just
old
enough
to
be
beginning
to
understand
things
but
he
loved
the
ancient
one
and
all
he
said
and
did
far
below
the
mountain
crag
lay
the
sea
in
the
night
while
it
slept
it
had
looked
dark
blue
or
violet
but
now
it
was
slowly
changing
its
color
the
sky
was
changing
too
it
was
growing
paler
and
paler
next
it
grew
faintly
brighter
so
did
the
sea
then
a
slight
flush
crept
over
land
and
water
and
all
the
small
floating
clouds
were
rosy
pink
king
amor
smiled
because
birds
voices
were
to
be
heard
in
the
trees
and
bushes
and
something
golden
bright
was
rising
out
of
the
edge
of
the
ocean
and
sparkling
light
danced
on
the
waves
it
rose
higher
and
higher
and
grew
so
dazzling
and
wonderful
that
he
threw
out
his
little
hand
with
a
shout
of
joy
the
next
moment
he
started
back
because
there
rose
near
him
a
loud
whirr
and
beating
of
powerful
wings
as
a
great
bird
flew
out
of
a
crag
near
by
and
soared
high
into
the
radiant
morning
heavens
it
is
the
eagle
who
is
our
neighbor
said
the
ancient
one
he
has
awakened
and
gone
to
give
his
greeting
to
the
sun
and
as
the
little
king
sat
upright
enraptured
he
saw
that
from
the
dazzling
brightness
at
the
edge
of
the
world
there
leaped
forth
a
ball
of
living
gold
and
fire
and
even
he
knew
that
the
sun
had
risen
at
every
day
dawn
it
leaps
forth
like
that
said
the
ancient
one
let
us
watch
together
and
i
will
tell
you
stories
of
it
so
they
sat
by
the
battlement
and
the
stories
were
told
they
were
stories
of
the
small
grains
lying
hid
in
the
dark
earth
waiting
for
the
golden
heat
of
the
sun
to
draw
them
forth
into
life
until
they
covered
the
tilled
fields
with
waving
wheat
to
make
bread
for
the
world
they
were
stories
of
the
seeds
of
fair
flowers
warmed
and
ripened
until
they
burst
into
scented
blossoms
they
were
stories
of
the
roots
of
trees
and
the
rich
sap
drawn
upward
by
the
heat
until
great
branches
and
thick
leafage
waved
in
the
summer
air
they
were
stories
of
men
women
and
children
walking
with
light
step
and
glad
because
of
the
gold
of
the
sun
every
day
it
warms
every
day
it
draws
every
day
it
ripens
and
gives
life
and
there
are
many
who
forget
the
wonder
of
it
lift
your
head
high
as
you
walk
young
king
and
often
look
upward
never
forget
the
sun
at
every
dawning
they
rose
and
saw
together
the
wonder
of
the
day
and
the
first
time
the
sky
was
heavy
with
gray
clouds
and
the
sun
did
not
leap
upward
from
behind
the
edge
of
the
world
the
ancient
one
said
another
thing
the
burning
gold
is
behind
the
lowering
gray
and
purple
the
clouds
are
heavy
with
soft
rain
when
they
break
they
will
drop
it
in
showers
or
splendid
storms
and
the
thirsty
earth
will
drink
it
up
the
grains
will
drink
it
and
the
seed
and
the
roots
and
the
world
will
be
joyous
and
rich
with
fresh
life
the
springs
will
bubble
up
like
crystal
and
the
brooks
will
rush
babbling
through
the
green
of
the
forest
the
drinking
places
for
the
cattle
will
be
full
and
clear
and
men
and
women
will
feel
rested
and
cool
lift
your
head
high
when
you
walk
young
king
and
often
look
upward
never
forget
the
clouds
so
hearing
these
things
every
day
king
amor
learned
the
meaning
of
both
sun
and
cloud
and
loved
and
felt
himself
brother
to
both
the
first
time
he
remembered
seeing
a
storm
the
ancient
one
took
him
to
the
battlements
again
and
together
they
watched
the
dark
clouds
pour
down
their
floods
while
their
purple
was
riven
by
the
dazzling
lances
of
the
lightning
and
the
thunder
rolled
and
crashed
and
seemed
to
rend
asunder
things
no
human
eye
could
see
and
the
wind
roared
round
the
castle
on
the
mountain
crag
and
beat
against
its
towers
and
tossed
the
branches
of
the
hugest
trees
and
whirled
the
rain
in
sheets
over
the
land
and
king
amor
stood
erect
and
strong
like
some
little
soldier
though
he
wondered
where
the
small
birds
were
and
if
the
eagle
were
in
his
nest
through
all
the
tumult
the
ancient
one
stood
still
he
looked
taller
than
ever
in
his
long
gray
robe
and
his
strange
eyes
were
deep
as
the
sea
at
last
he
said
in
a
slow
calm
voice
this
is
the
voice
of
the
power
men
know
not
no
man
has
yet
quite
understood
though
it
seems
to
speak
harken
to
it
let
your
soul
stand
silent
listen
young
king
hold
your
head
high
as
you
walk
and
often
look
upward
never
forget
the
storm
so
the
king
learned
to
love
the
storm
and
be
one
with
it
knowing
no
fear
but
perhaps
it
might
be
because
he
had
been
laid
on
the
scented
moss
and
had
without
knowing
it
saluted
them
on
the
first
night
of
his
life
he
felt
nearest
to
and
loved
most
his
brothers
the
stars
every
fair
night
through
the
king
earliest
years
the
ancient
one
carried
him
to
the
battlements
and
let
him
fall
asleep
beneath
the
shining
myriads
but
first
he
would
walk
about
bearing
him
in
his
arms
or
sit
with
him
in
the
splendid
silence
sometimes
relating
wonders
to
him
in
a
low
voice
sometimes
uttering
no
word
only
looking
calmly
into
the
high
vault
above
as
if
the
stars
spoke
to
him
and
told
him
of
perfect
peace
when
a
man
looks
long
at
them
he
said
he
grows
calm
and
forgets
small
things
they
answer
his
questions
and
show
him
that
his
earth
is
only
one
of
the
million
worlds
hold
your
soul
still
and
look
upward
often
and
you
will
understand
their
speech
never
forget
the
stars
part
two
so
as
the
child
king
grew
day
by
day
the
world
seemed
to
grow
fuller
and
fuller
of
wonders
and
beauties
there
were
the
sun
and
the
moon
the
storm
and
the
stars
the
straight
falling
lances
of
rain
the
springing
of
the
growing
things
the
flight
of
the
eagle
the
songs
and
nests
of
small
bird
creatures
the
changing
seasons
and
the
work
of
the
great
brown
earth
giving
its
harvest
and
its
fruits
all
these
wonders
in
one
world
and
you
a
man
upon
it
said
the
ancient
one
hold
high
your
head
when
you
walk
young
king
and
often
look
upward
never
forget
one
marvel
among
them
all
he
forgot
nothing
he
lived
looking
out
on
all
things
from
great
clear
joyous
eyes
upon
his
mountain
crag
he
never
heard
a
paltry
or
unbeautiful
word
or
knew
of
the
existence
of
unfriendliness
or
baseness
in
thought
as
soon
as
he
was
old
enough
to
go
out
alone
he
roamed
about
the
great
mountain
and
feared
neither
storm
nor
wild
beasts
lions
and
their
mates
drew
near
and
fawned
on
him
as
their
kind
had
fawned
on
young
adam
in
the
garden
of
eden
there
had
never
passed
through
his
mind
the
thought
that
they
were
not
his
friends
he
did
not
know
that
there
were
men
who
killed
their
wild
brothers
in
the
huge
courtyard
of
the
castle
he
learned
to
ride
and
to
perform
great
feats
of
strength
because
he
had
not
learned
to
be
afraid
he
never
feared
that
he
could
not
do
a
thing
he
grew
so
strong
and
beautiful
that
when
he
was
ten
years
old
he
was
as
tall
as
a
youth
of
sixteen
and
when
he
was
sixteen
he
was
already
like
a
young
giant
this
was
because
he
had
been
brother
to
the
storm
and
had
lived
close
to
the
strength
and
splendor
of
the
stars
only
once
when
he
was
a
boy
of
twelve
a
strange
and
painful
thing
happened
to
him
from
his
kingdom
in
the
plains
below
there
had
been
sent
to
him
a
beautiful
young
horse
which
had
been
bred
for
him
never
had
so
magnificent
an
animal
been
born
in
the
royal
stable
when
he
was
brought
into
the
courtyard
the
boy
king
eyes
shone
with
joy
he
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
morning
in
exercising
and
leaping
him
over
barriers
the
ancient
one
in
his
tower
chamber
heard
his
shouts
of
exultation
and
encouragement
at
last
the
king
went
out
to
try
him
on
the
winding
mountain
road
when
he
returned
he
went
at
once
to
the
tower
chamber
to
the
ancient
one
who
when
he
raised
his
eyes
from
his
great
book
looked
at
him
gravely
let
us
climb
to
the
battlements
the
boy
said
we
must
talk
together
so
they
went
and
when
they
stood
looking
out
on
the
world
below
the
curving
turquoise
sky
above
them
the
eyes
of
the
ancient
one
were
still
more
grave
tell
me
young
king
something
strange
has
happened
king
amor
answered
i
have
felt
something
i
have
not
felt
before
i
was
riding
my
horse
around
the
field
on
the
plateau
and
he
saw
something
which
he
refused
to
pass
it
was
a
young
leopard
watching
us
from
a
tree
my
horse
reared
and
snorted
he
would
not
listen
to
me
but
backed
and
wheeled
around
i
tried
in
vain
to
persuade
him
and
suddenly
when
i
saw
i
could
not
make
him
obey
me
this
strange
new
feeling
rushed
through
all
my
body
i
grew
hot
and
knew
my
face
was
scarlet
my
heart
beat
faster
and
my
blood
seemed
to
boil
in
my
veins
i
shouted
out
harsh
ugly
sounds
i
forgot
that
all
things
are
brothers
i
lifted
my
hand
and
clenched
it
and
struck
my
horse
again
and
again
i
loved
him
no
longer
i
felt
that
he
no
longer
loved
me
i
am
hot
and
wearied
and
heavy
from
it
still
i
feel
no
more
joy
was
it
pain
i
felt
i
have
never
felt
pain
and
do
not
know
was
it
pain
it
was
a
worse
thing
answered
the
ancient
one
it
was
anger
when
a
man
is
overcome
by
anger
he
has
a
poisoned
fever
he
loses
his
strength
he
loses
his
power
over
himself
and
over
others
he
throws
away
time
in
which
he
might
have
gained
the
end
he
most
desires
there
is
no
time
for
anger
in
the
world
so
king
amor
learned
the
uselessness
of
anger
for
they
sat
long
upon
the
battlements
while
the
ancient
one
told
him
how
its
poison
worked
in
the
veins
and
weakened
the
strongest
man
until
he
was
made
a
fool
that
night
amor
lay
under
the
sky
looking
at
his
myriad
brothers
the
stars
and
drawing
calm
from
them
if
you
lie
through
the
night
upon
the
battlements
and
think
only
of
the
stillness
and
the
stars
you
will
forget
your
anger
and
its
poison
will
die
away
if
you
put
into
your
mind
a
beautiful
thought
it
will
take
the
place
of
the
evil
one
there
is
no
room
for
darkness
in
the
mind
of
him
who
thinks
only
of
the
stars
this
had
been
said
to
him
by
the
ancient
one
upon
the
plateau
at
the
foot
of
the
crag
on
which
the
castle
stood
there
were
marvelous
walled
gardens
the
sad
young
queen
of
the
first
king
mordreth
had
planted
them
and
after
her
death
they
had
been
left
to
run
wild
since
the
baby
king
amor
had
been
brought
to
the
mountain
top
the
ancient
one
and
his
servitor
had
made
them
bloom
again
as
soon
as
he
was
old
enough
to
hold
a
small
spade
amor
had
worked
in
the
beds
all
things
grew
for
him
as
if
his
touch
were
a
spell
birds
and
bees
and
butterflies
flocked
round
him
as
he
labored
he
knew
what
the
bees
hummed
and
where
they
flew
to
load
themselves
with
honey
butterflies
lighted
upon
his
hands
and
taught
him
strange
things
birds
told
him
of
their
travels
and
brought
him
seeds
from
far
countries
which
he
planted
in
his
gardens
and
which
bloomed
into
marvelous
flowers
a
swallow
who
loved
him
very
much
and
who
had
seen
many
wonderful
lands
once
brought
him
a
seed
from
an
emperor
secret
garden
which
none
but
four
of
his
own
slaves
had
ever
seen
these
slaves
had
been
born
in
the
garden
and
would
never
leave
it
while
they
lived
king
amor
planted
the
seed
in
a
pleasaunce
of
its
own
it
grew
into
the
most
beautiful
blue
flower
the
world
had
ever
known
it
was
of
a
blue
so
pure
and
exquisitely
intense
that
it
was
rapture
to
look
at
it
its
blossoms
hung
from
a
tall
stem
and
in
its
first
year
it
gave
a
thousand
seeds
each
year
amor
planted
more
flowers
and
each
year
they
grew
taller
and
more
wonderful
and
blossomed
a
longer
time
when
the
summer
wind
blew
it
shook
out
clouds
of
delicate
fragrance
which
sometimes
floated
down
the
mountain
until
the
wretched
dwellers
in
king
land
forgot
their
quarrels
and
misery
and
even
lifted
their
heavy
heads
to
inhale
it
and
ask
each
other
what
was
being
done
upon
the
mountain
each
year
king
amor
gathered
the
seeds
and
stored
them
in
an
unused
tower
of
his
castle
taller
and
stronger
he
grew
and
each
day
wiser
and
more
beautiful
each
plant
each
weed
each
thing
each
wind
each
star
of
heaven
taught
him
its
wonders
and
its
wisdom
his
eyes
were
so
marvelous
in
their
splendor
that
when
he
looked
at
a
man
they
seemed
to
read
his
soul
and
command
its
truth
to
answer
him
he
was
so
powerful
that
he
could
break
an
iron
bar
in
two
pieces
with
his
hands
when
he
was
twenty
years
old
the
ancient
one
took
him
up
on
the
battlements
and
giving
him
a
strong
glass
told
him
to
look
down
upon
the
capital
city
on
the
plain
and
see
what
was
being
done
there
i
see
many
people
gathered
in
crowds
amor
said
when
he
had
looked
for
a
few
moments
i
see
bright
colors
and
waving
pennants
and
triumphal
arches
it
is
as
if
some
great
ceremony
were
being
prepared
for
the
people
are
making
ready
for
your
coronation
said
the
ancient
one
you
will
be
led
in
state
down
the
mountain
and
acclaimed
king
it
was
to
fit
you
to
reign
over
your
kingdom
that
i
taught
you
to
know
all
the
wonders
of
the
world
and
have
shown
you
that
no
thing
is
useless
but
folly
and
dishonoring
thought
that
which
you
have
learned
from
your
brothers
here
you
go
down
the
mountain
to
teach
your
brothers
there
you
will
see
things
which
are
not
beautiful
and
those
which
are
unclean
but
hold
high
your
head
when
you
walk
young
king
and
never
forget
the
sun
the
wind
and
the
stars
to
himself
as
he
looked
on
him
the
ancient
one
said
when
he
stands
before
them
they
will
think
he
is
a
young
god
the
next
morning
a
splendid
procession
wound
its
glittering
way
up
the
mountain
road
to
the
castle
there
were
princes
and
nobles
and
chieftains
rich
colors
glowed
in
their
attire
and
gorgeous
banners
and
pennants
waved
over
them
while
music
from
gold
and
silver
trumpets
accompanied
them
as
they
rode
and
their
many
followers
marched
behind
the
ancient
one
in
his
long
robe
of
gray
stood
by
king
amor
on
the
broad
stone
terrace
guarded
by
its
crouching
carved
lions
this
is
your
king
o
people
he
said
and
when
the
people
looked
it
was
as
he
had
said
it
would
be
they
drew
back
a
little
and
gazed
in
fear
and
many
of
the
followers
fell
upon
their
knees
they
thought
they
saw
a
beautiful
young
giant
and
god
but
he
was
only
a
splendid
and
powerful
young
man
who
had
never
known
a
dark
thought
and
had
lived
near
to
his
brothers
the
stars
his
horse
adorned
with
golden
trappings
was
brought
and
he
was
led
down
the
mountain
side
through
the
gates
into
the
capital
city
of
his
kingdom
he
desired
that
the
ancient
one
should
ride
by
his
side
what
he
saw
as
he
rode
to
the
place
of
coronation
he
had
never
seen
before
notwithstanding
the
embroidered
silk
and
velvet
hangings
decorating
the
fronts
of
the
rich
people
houses
he
caught
glimpses
of
filthy
side
streets
squalid
alleys
and
tenements
he
saw
forlorn
little
children
scud
away
like
rats
into
their
holes
as
he
drew
near
and
wretched
men
and
women
fighting
with
each
other
for
places
in
the
crowd
sharp
miserable
faces
peered
round
corners
at
him
and
nobody
smiled
because
every
one
hated
or
distrusted
his
neighbor
and
they
dreaded
and
disliked
the
young
king
because
all
the
king
mordreths
had
been
evil
and
selfish
and
he
was
their
descendant
when
they
saw
that
he
was
so
tall
and
powerful
and
carried
his
handsome
head
so
high
often
looking
upward
they
feared
him
still
more
as
their
own
heads
hung
down
they
never
saw
anything
but
the
dirt
and
dust
beneath
their
feet
or
the
quarrels
about
them
so
their
minds
were
full
of
fears
and
ugly
thoughts
and
they
at
once
began
to
be
afraid
of
him
and
suspect
him
of
being
proud
he
could
do
twice
as
much
evil
as
the
other
kings
they
said
since
he
was
twice
as
strong
and
twice
as
handsome
it
was
their
nature
to
first
think
an
evil
thought
of
anything
or
anybody
and
to
be
afraid
of
all
things
at
the
outset
the
princes
and
nobles
who
rode
in
the
procession
tried
to
prevent
king
amor
seeing
the
people
and
streets
they
pointed
out
the
palaces
and
decorations
and
beautiful
ladies
throwing
flowers
in
his
path
from
the
balconies
he
praised
all
the
splendors
and
saluted
the
balconies
looking
up
with
such
radiant
and
smiling
eyes
that
the
ladies
almost
threw
themselves
after
their
flowers
and
cried
out
that
never
never
had
there
been
crowned
such
a
beautiful
young
king
before
do
not
look
at
the
rabble
your
majesty
the
prime
minister
said
they
are
an
evil
lot
of
worthless
malcontents
and
thieves
i
would
not
look
at
them
answered
king
amor
if
i
knew
that
i
could
not
help
them
there
is
no
time
to
look
at
dark
things
if
one
can
not
make
them
brighter
i
look
at
these
because
there
is
something
to
be
done
i
do
not
yet
know
what
there
is
such
hatred
in
their
eyes
that
they
will
only
make
you
angry
sire
said
a
handsome
young
prince
who
rode
near
there
is
no
time
for
anger
said
amor
holding
his
crowned
head
high
it
is
a
worthless
thing
after
sunset
there
was
a
great
banquet
and
after
it
a
great
ball
and
the
courtiers
and
princes
were
delighted
by
the
beauty
and
grace
of
the
new
king
he
was
much
brighter
and
more
charming
than
any
of
the
king
mordreths
had
been
his
laugh
was
full
of
gaiety
and
the
people
who
stood
near
him
felt
happier
though
they
did
not
know
why
but
when
the
ball
was
at
its
height
he
stepped
into
the
center
of
the
room
and
spoke
aloud
to
the
splendid
company
i
have
seen
the
broad
streets
and
the
palaces
and
all
that
is
beautiful
in
my
capital
he
said
now
i
must
go
to
the
narrow
streets
and
the
dark
ones
i
must
see
the
miserable
people
the
cripples
the
wretched
ones
the
drunkards
and
the
thieves
every
one
clamored
and
protested
these
things
they
had
hidden
from
him
they
said
kings
should
not
see
them
i
will
see
them
he
said
with
a
smile
which
was
beautiful
and
strange
i
go
now
on
foot
and
unattended
except
for
my
friend
the
ancient
one
let
the
ball
go
on
he
strode
through
the
glittering
throng
with
the
ancient
one
at
his
side
he
still
wore
his
crown
upon
his
head
because
he
wished
his
people
to
know
that
their
king
had
come
to
them
through
dark
and
loathsome
places
they
went
through
narrow
streets
and
back
alleys
and
courts
where
people
scurried
away
like
rats
as
the
gutter
children
had
done
in
the
daytime
king
amor
could
not
have
seen
them
but
that
he
had
brought
with
him
a
bright
lantern
and
held
it
up
in
the
air
above
his
high
head
the
light
shining
upon
his
beautiful
face
and
his
crown
made
him
look
more
than
ever
like
a
young
god
and
giant
and
the
people
cowered
terrified
before
him
asking
each
other
what
such
a
king
would
do
to
wretches
like
themselves
but
just
a
few
very
little
children
smiled
at
him
because
he
was
so
young
and
bright
and
splendid
no
one
in
the
black
holes
and
corners
could
understand
why
a
king
should
come
walking
among
them
on
the
night
of
his
coronation
day
most
of
them
thought
that
the
next
morning
he
would
order
them
all
to
be
killed
and
their
houses
burned
because
he
would
only
think
of
them
as
vermin
once
as
he
passed
through
a
dark
court
a
madman
darted
out
in
his
path
shaking
his
fist
we
hate
you
he
cried
out
we
hate
you
the
dwellers
in
the
court
gasped
with
terror
wondering
what
would
happen
but
the
tall
young
king
stood
holding
his
lantern
above
his
head
and
gazing
at
the
madman
with
deep
thought
in
his
eyes
there
is
no
time
for
hatred
in
the
world
he
said
there
is
no
time
and
then
he
passed
on
the
look
of
deep
thought
was
in
his
face
throughout
the
hours
in
which
he
strode
on
until
he
had
seen
all
he
had
come
to
see
the
next
day
he
rode
back
up
the
mountain
to
his
castle
on
the
crag
and
when
the
night
fell
he
lay
out
upon
the
battlements
under
the
sky
as
he
had
done
on
so
many
nights
the
soft
wind
blew
about
him
as
he
looked
up
at
the
stars
i
do
not
know
my
brothers
he
said
to
them
tell
me
and
he
lay
silent
until
the
great
sweet
stillness
of
the
night
seemed
to
fill
his
soul
and
when
the
stars
began
to
fade
he
slept
in
rapturous
peace
the
people
in
his
kingdom
on
the
plain
waited
wondering
what
he
would
do
during
the
next
few
days
they
quarreled
and
hated
each
other
more
than
ever
the
rich
ones
because
they
all
wanted
to
gain
his
favor
and
each
was
jealous
of
the
other
the
poor
ones
because
they
were
afraid
of
him
and
each
man
feared
that
his
neighbor
would
betray
things
he
had
done
in
the
past
only
two
boys
working
together
in
a
field
having
stopped
to
wrangle
and
fight
one
of
them
suddenly
stood
still
remembering
something
and
said
a
strange
thing
in
a
strange
voice
there
is
no
time
for
anger
there
is
no
time
and
as
he
fell
to
work
again
his
companion
did
the
same
and
when
they
had
finished
their
task
of
weeding
they
talked
about
the
thing
and
remembered
that
when
they
had
quarreled
the
day
before
they
had
not
finished
their
task
at
all
and
had
not
been
paid
and
had
gone
home
sore
from
the
blows
they
had
given
each
other
and
had
had
no
supper
no
there
is
no
time
they
decided
at
the
beginning
of
the
following
week
there
were
rumors
that
a
strange
law
had
been
made
the
strangest
ever
known
in
the
world
it
was
something
about
a
blue
flower
what
had
flowers
to
do
with
laws
or
what
had
laws
to
do
with
flowers
people
quarreled
about
what
the
meaning
of
such
a
law
might
be
those
who
thought
first
of
evil
things
and
fears
began
to
say
that
in
the
rich
people
gardens
was
to
be
planted
a
blue
flower
whose
perfume
would
poison
all
the
poor
the
only
ones
who
did
not
quarrel
were
the
two
boys
and
their
friends
who
had
already
begun
to
make
a
sort
of
password
of
there
is
no
time
for
anger
one
of
them
who
was
clever
added
a
new
idea
to
the
saying
there
is
no
time
for
fear
he
cried
out
in
the
field
let
us
go
on
with
our
work
and
they
finished
their
task
early
and
played
games
at
last
one
morning
it
was
made
known
that
the
new
king
was
to
give
a
feast
in
the
open
air
to
all
the
people
it
was
to
be
on
the
plain
outside
the
city
and
he
himself
was
going
to
proclaim
to
them
the
law
of
the
blue
flower
now
we
shall
know
the
worst
growled
and
shivered
the
afraid
ones
as
they
shuffled
their
way
to
the
plain
and
the
boys
who
used
the
password
heard
them
there
is
no
time
to
think
of
the
worst
shouted
the
clever
one
at
the
top
of
his
voice
there
is
no
time
we
shall
be
late
for
the
feast
and
a
number
of
people
actually
turned
to
listen
because
there
was
a
high
strong
gay
sound
in
his
voice
such
as
had
never
been
heard
in
king
mordreth
land
before
the
plain
was
covered
with
thick
green
grass
and
beautiful
spreading
trees
grew
on
it
there
was
a
richly
draped
platform
for
king
gold
and
ivory
chair
but
when
the
people
gathered
about
he
stood
up
before
them
a
beautiful
young
giant
with
eyes
like
fixed
stars
and
head
held
high
and
he
read
his
law
in
a
voice
which
wonderful
to
relate
was
heard
by
every
man
woman
and
child
even
by
the
little
cripple
crouching
alone
in
the
grass
on
the
very
outskirts
of
the
crowd
and
not
expecting
to
hear
or
see
anything
this
is
what
he
read
in
my
pleasaunce
on
the
mountain
top
there
grows
a
blue
flower
one
of
my
brothers
the
birds
brought
me
its
seed
from
an
emperor
hidden
garden
it
is
as
beautiful
as
the
sky
at
dawn
it
has
a
strange
power
it
dispels
evil
fortune
and
the
dark
thoughts
which
bring
it
there
is
no
time
for
dark
thoughts
there
is
no
time
for
evil
listen
to
my
law
tomorrow
seeds
will
be
given
to
every
man
woman
and
child
in
my
kingdom
even
to
the
newborn
every
man
woman
and
child
even
the
newborn
is
commanded
by
the
law
to
plant
and
feed
and
watch
over
the
blue
flower
it
is
the
work
of
each
to
make
it
grow
the
mother
of
the
newborn
can
hold
its
little
hand
and
make
it
drop
the
seeds
into
the
earth
as
the
child
grows
she
must
show
it
the
green
shoots
when
they
pierce
the
brown
soil
she
must
babble
to
it
of
its
blue
flower
by
the
time
it
is
pleased
by
color
it
will
love
the
blossoms
and
the
spell
of
happiness
and
good
fortune
will
begin
to
work
for
it
it
is
not
one
person
here
and
there
who
must
plant
the
flower
but
each
and
every
one
to
those
who
have
not
land
about
them
all
the
land
is
free
you
may
plant
by
the
roadside
in
a
cranny
of
a
wall
in
an
old
box
or
glass
or
tub
in
any
bare
space
in
any
man
field
or
garden
but
each
must
plant
his
seeds
and
watch
over
and
feed
them
next
year
when
the
blue
flower
blossoms
i
shall
ride
through
my
kingdom
and
bestow
my
rewards
this
is
my
law
what
will
befall
if
some
of
us
do
not
make
them
grow
groaned
some
of
the
afraid
ones
there
is
no
time
to
think
of
that
shouted
the
boy
who
was
clever
plant
them
when
the
prime
minister
and
his
followers
told
the
king
that
larger
and
stronger
prisons
must
be
built
for
the
many
criminals
and
that
heavier
taxes
must
be
laid
upon
the
people
to
rescue
the
country
from
poverty
his
answer
to
them
was
wait
until
the
blooming
of
the
blue
flower
in
a
short
time
every
one
was
working
in
the
open
air
digging
in
the
soil
tiny
children
as
well
as
men
and
women
drunkards
and
thieves
and
idlers
who
had
never
worked
before
came
out
of
their
dark
holes
and
corners
into
the
light
of
the
sun
it
was
not
a
hard
thing
to
plant
a
few
flower
seeds
and
because
the
king
amor
looked
so
much
more
powerful
than
other
men
and
had
eyes
so
wonderful
and
commanding
they
did
not
know
what
punishment
he
would
invent
for
them
and
were
afraid
to
disobey
him
but
somehow
after
they
had
worked
in
the
earth
for
a
while
and
had
seen
others
working
the
light
of
the
sun
and
the
freshness
of
the
air
made
them
feel
in
better
humor
the
wind
blew
away
their
evil
fancies
and
their
headaches
and
because
there
was
so
much
talk
and
wondering
about
the
magic
of
the
blue
flower
they
became
interested
and
wanted
to
see
what
it
would
do
for
them
when
it
blossomed
scarcely
any
of
them
had
ever
tried
to
make
a
flower
grow
before
and
they
gradually
thought
of
it
a
great
deal
there
was
less
quarreling
because
conversation
with
neighbors
all
about
a
blue
flower
gave
no
reason
for
hard
words
the
worst
and
idlest
were
curious
about
it
and
every
one
tried
experiments
of
his
own
the
children
were
delighted
and
actually
grew
happy
and
rosy
over
their
digging
and
watering
and
gradually
all
sorts
of
curious
things
happened
people
who
were
growing
blue
flowers
began
to
keep
the
ground
around
about
them
in
order
they
did
not
like
to
see
bits
of
paper
and
rubbish
lying
about
so
they
cleared
them
away
one
quite
new
thing
which
occurred
was
that
sometimes
people
even
helped
each
other
a
little
cripples
and
those
who
were
weak
actually
found
that
there
were
stronger
ones
who
would
do
things
for
them
when
their
backs
ached
and
it
was
hard
to
carry
water
or
dig
up
weeds
no
one
in
king
land
had
ever
helped
another
before
the
boy
who
was
clever
did
more
than
all
the
rest
he
gathered
together
all
the
children
he
could
and
formed
them
into
a
band
using
the
passwords
in
time
it
became
quite
like
a
little
army
they
called
themselves
the
band
of
the
blue
flower
and
each
boy
and
girl
was
bound
to
remember
the
passwords
and
apply
them
to
all
they
did
so
often
when
a
number
of
people
were
together
and
things
began
to
go
wrong
a
clear
young
voice
would
cry
out
somewhere
like
a
silver
battle
cry
there
is
no
time
for
anger
or
there
is
no
time
for
hate
or
there
is
no
time
to
fret
there
is
no
time
among
the
great
and
rich
people
also
singular
things
came
to
pass
those
who
had
wasted
their
days
loitering
or
rioting
were
obliged
to
get
up
in
the
morning
to
work
in
their
gardens
and
finding
that
exercise
and
fresh
air
improved
their
health
and
spirits
they
began
to
like
it
court
ladies
found
it
good
for
their
complexions
and
tempers
busy
merchants
discovered
that
it
made
their
heads
clearer
ambitious
students
found
that
after
an
hour
spent
evening
and
morning
over
their
blue
flower
beds
they
could
study
twice
as
long
without
fatigue
the
children
of
the
princes
and
nobles
became
so
full
of
work
and
talk
of
their
soil
and
their
seeds
that
they
quite
forgot
to
squabble
and
be
jealous
of
each
other
importance
at
court
never
in
one
story
could
it
be
told
how
many
unusual
interesting
and
wonderful
things
occurred
in
the
once
gloomy
king
mordreth
land
just
because
every
person
in
it
rich
and
poor
old
and
young
good
and
bad
had
to
plant
and
care
for
and
live
every
day
of
life
with
a
blue
flower
oh
the
corners
and
crannies
and
queer
places
it
was
planted
in
and
oh
the
thrill
of
excitement
everywhere
when
the
first
tender
green
shoots
thrust
their
way
through
the
earth
and
the
wave
of
excitement
which
passed
over
the
whole
land
when
the
first
buds
showed
themselves
by
that
time
every
one
was
so
interested
that
even
the
afraid
ones
had
forgotten
to
ask
each
other
what
king
amor
would
do
to
them
if
they
had
no
blue
flower
somehow
people
had
gained
courage
and
they
knew
the
blue
flower
would
grow
and
they
knew
there
was
no
time
to
stop
working
while
they
worried
and
said
suppose
it
did
there
was
no
time
sometimes
the
young
king
was
on
the
mountain
top
with
the
wind
and
the
eagle
and
the
stars
and
sometimes
he
was
in
his
palace
in
the
city
but
he
was
always
working
and
thinking
for
his
people
he
was
not
seen
by
the
people
however
until
a
splendid
summer
day
came
when
it
was
proclaimed
by
heralds
in
the
streets
that
he
would
begin
his
journey
through
the
land
by
riding
through
the
capital
city
to
see
the
blossoming
of
the
blue
flowers
and
there
would
be
a
feast
once
more
upon
the
plain
it
was
a
wonderful
day
the
air
was
full
of
golden
light
and
the
sky
of
such
a
blueness
as
never
had
been
seen
before
out
of
the
palace
gates
he
rode
and
he
wore
his
crown
and
his
eyes
were
more
brilliant
than
the
jewels
in
it
and
his
smile
was
more
radiant
than
a
sunrise
as
he
looked
about
him
for
every
breath
he
drew
in
was
fragrant
every
ugly
place
was
hidden
and
every
squalid
corner
filled
with
beauty
for
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
world
were
waving
with
blue
flowers
houses
and
fences
were
covered
with
them
because
some
of
them
climbed
like
vines
neglected
fields
and
gardens
had
been
made
neat
so
that
they
would
grow
rubbish
and
dirt
had
been
cleaned
away
to
make
room
for
clumps
and
patches
of
them
you
could
not
grow
the
blue
flower
among
dirt
and
disorder
any
more
than
you
could
grow
it
while
you
were
spending
your
time
in
drinking
and
quarreling
by
the
road
sides
in
courts
in
windows
in
cracks
in
walls
in
broken
places
in
roofs
in
great
people
gardens
on
the
window
sills
or
about
the
doorways
of
poor
people
hovels
fair
and
fragrant
and
waving
grew
the
blue
flower
where
it
waved
there
was
no
room
for
dirt
and
rubbish
and
suddenly
even
the
dullest
people
began
to
see
that
the
face
of
the
whole
land
was
changed
as
if
by
some
strange
magic
and
the
whole
population
seemed
changed
with
it
everybody
looked
fresher
and
more
cheerful
people
had
actually
learned
to
smile
and
keep
themselves
clean
and
there
was
not
one
who
was
not
healthier
they
had
in
fact
been
noticing
this
for
some
time
and
they
had
said
to
each
other
that
the
power
of
the
blue
flower
of
which
the
king
had
spoken
was
beginning
to
work
the
children
had
grown
gay
and
rosy
and
the
boy
who
was
clever
and
all
his
companions
had
found
time
to
earn
themselves
new
clothes
because
they
had
never
forgotten
their
passwords
all
the
farmers
wanted
them
to
work
in
their
fields
because
they
said
there
was
no
time
to
idle
no
time
to
fight
no
time
to
play
evil
tricks
on
the
king
rode
and
on
and
on
and
on
and
the
farther
he
went
the
more
splendid
and
joyous
his
smile
grew
but
at
no
time
during
the
day
was
it
more
beautiful
than
when
he
met
the
little
cripple
who
had
sat
on
the
outside
of
the
crowd
on
the
first
feast
day
not
expecting
to
see
or
hear
anything
the
cripple
lived
in
a
tiny
hovel
on
the
edge
of
the
city
and
when
the
glittering
procession
drew
near
it
the
small
patch
of
garden
was
quite
bare
and
had
not
a
blue
flower
in
it
and
the
little
cripple
was
sitting
huddled
upon
his
broken
sobbing
softly
with
his
face
hidden
in
his
arms
king
amor
drew
up
his
white
horse
and
looked
at
him
and
looked
at
his
bare
garden
what
has
happened
here
he
said
this
garden
has
not
been
neglected
it
has
been
dug
and
kept
free
of
weeds
but
my
law
has
been
broken
there
is
no
blue
flower
then
the
little
cripple
got
up
trembling
and
hobbled
through
his
rickety
gate
and
threw
himself
down
upon
the
earth
before
the
king
white
horse
sobbing
hopelessly
and
oh
king
he
cried
i
am
only
a
cripple
and
small
and
i
can
easily
be
killed
i
have
no
flowers
at
all
when
i
opened
my
package
of
seeds
i
was
so
glad
that
i
forgot
the
wind
was
blowing
and
suddenly
a
great
gust
carried
them
all
away
forever
and
i
had
not
even
one
left
i
was
afraid
to
tell
anybody
and
then
he
cried
so
that
he
could
not
speak
go
on
said
the
young
king
gently
what
did
you
do
i
could
do
nothing
said
the
little
cripple
only
i
made
my
garden
neat
and
kept
away
the
weeds
and
sometimes
i
asked
other
people
to
let
me
dig
a
little
for
them
and
always
when
i
went
out
i
picked
up
the
ugly
things
i
saw
lying
about
the
bits
of
paper
and
rubbish
and
i
dug
holes
for
them
in
the
earth
but
i
have
broken
your
law
then
the
people
gasped
for
breath
for
king
amor
dismounted
from
his
horse
and
lifted
the
little
cripple
up
in
his
arms
and
held
him
against
his
breast
you
shall
ride
with
me
today
he
said
and
go
to
my
castle
on
the
mountain
crag
and
live
near
the
stars
and
the
sun
when
you
kept
the
weeds
from
your
bare
little
garden
and
when
you
dug
for
others
and
hid
away
ugliness
and
disorder
you
planted
a
blue
flower
every
day
you
have
planted
more
than
all
the
rest
and
your
reward
shall
be
the
sweetest
for
you
planted
without
the
seeds
and
then
the
people
shouted
until
the
world
seemed
to
ring
with
their
joy
and
somehow
they
knew
that
king
mordreth
land
had
come
into
fair
days
and
they
thought
it
was
the
blue
flower
magic
but
the
earth
is
full
of
magic
amor
said
to
the
ancient
one
after
the
feast
on
the
plain
was
over
most
men
know
nothing
of
it
and
so
comes
misery
the
first
law
of
the
earth
magic
is
this
one
if
you
fill
your
mind
with
a
beautiful
thought
there
will
be
no
room
in
it
for
an
ugly
one
this
i
learned
from
you
and
from
my
brothers
the
stars
so
i
gave
my
people
the
blue
flower
to
think
of
and
work
for
it
led
them
to
see
beauty
and
to
work
happily
and
filled
the
land
with
bloom
i
their
king
am
their
brother
and
soon
they
will
understand
this
and
i
can
help
them
and
all
will
be
well
they
shall
be
wise
and
joyous
and
know
good
fortune
the
little
cripple
lived
near
the
sun
and
the
stars
in
the
castle
on
the
mountain
crag
until
he
grew
strong
and
straight
then
he
was
the
chief
gardener
the
boy
who
was
clever
was
made
captain
of
his
band
which
became
the
king
own
guard
and
never
left
him
and
the
gloom
of
king
mordreth
land
was
forgotten
because
it
was
known
throughout
all
the
world
as
the
land
of
the
blue
flower
