chapter
i
the
home
of
the
ally
and
because
the
town
of
this
story
is
what
it
is
there
came
to
dwell
in
it
a
spirit
a
strange
mysterious
power
playful
vicious
deadly
a
something
to
be
at
once
feared
and
courted
to
be
denied
yet
confessed
in
the
denial
a
deadly
enemy
a
welcome
friend
an
ally
this
story
began
in
the
ozark
mountains
it
follows
the
trail
that
is
nobody
knows
how
old
but
mostly
this
story
happened
in
corinth
a
town
of
the
middle
class
in
a
middle
western
state
there
is
nothing
peculiar
about
corinth
the
story
might
have
happened
just
as
well
in
any
other
place
for
the
only
distinguishing
feature
about
this
town
is
its
utter
lack
of
any
distinguishing
feature
whatever
in
all
the
essential
elements
of
its
life
so
far
as
this
story
goes
corinth
is
exactly
like
every
other
village
town
or
city
in
the
land
this
indeed
is
why
the
story
happened
in
this
particular
place
years
ago
when
the
railroad
first
climbed
the
backbone
of
the
ozarks
it
found
corinth
already
located
on
the
summit
even
before
the
war
this
town
was
a
place
of
no
little
importance
and
many
a
good
tale
might
be
told
of
those
exciting
days
when
the
woods
were
full
of
guerrillas
and
bushwhackers
and
the
village
was
raided
first
by
one
side
then
by
the
other
many
a
good
tale
is
told
indeed
for
the
fathers
and
mothers
of
corinth
love
to
talk
of
the
war
times
and
to
point
out
in
old
town
the
buildings
and
the
scenes
of
many
thrilling
events
but
the
sons
and
daughters
of
the
passing
generation
with
their
sons
and
daughters
like
better
to
talk
of
the
great
things
that
are
going
to
be
when
the
proposed
comes
the
mills
are
established
the
electric
line
is
built
out
from
the
city
or
the
capitalist
from
arrives
to
invest
in
vacant
lots
thereon
to
build
new
hotels
and
business
blocks
the
doctor
says
that
in
the
whole
history
of
corinth
there
are
only
two
events
the
first
was
the
coming
of
the
railroad
the
second
was
the
death
of
the
doctor
good
friend
the
statesman
the
railroad
did
not
actually
enter
corinth
it
stopped
at
the
front
gate
but
with
judge
strong
assistance
the
fathers
and
mothers
recognized
their
golden
opportunity
and
took
the
step
which
the
eloquent
judge
assured
them
would
result
in
a
glorious
future
they
left
the
beautiful
site
chosen
by
those
who
cleared
the
wilderness
and
stretched
themselves
out
along
the
on
either
side
of
the
sacred
that
same
being
incidentally
the
property
of
the
patriotic
judge
thus
corinth
took
the
railroad
to
her
heart
literally
the
depot
the
yards
the
red
and
the
are
all
in
the
very
center
of
the
town
every
train
while
stopping
for
water
and
they
all
stop
blocks
two
of
the
three
principal
streets
and
when
after
waiting
in
the
rain
or
snow
until
his
patience
is
nearly
exhausted
the
humble
corinthian
goes
to
the
only
remaining
crossing
he
always
gets
there
just
in
time
to
meet
a
long
freight
backing
onto
the
siding
nowhere
in
the
whole
place
can
one
escape
the
screaming
whistle
clanging
bell
and
crashing
drawbar
day
and
night
the
rumble
of
the
heavy
trains
jars
and
disturbs
the
peacefulness
of
the
little
village
but
the
railroad
did
something
for
corinth
not
too
much
but
something
it
did
more
for
judge
strong
for
a
time
the
town
grew
rapidly
fulfillment
of
the
judge
prophecies
seemed
immediate
and
certain
then
as
mysteriously
as
they
had
come
the
boom
days
departed
the
mills
factories
and
shops
that
were
going
to
be
established
themselves
elsewhere
the
sound
of
the
builder
hammer
was
no
longer
heard
the
doctor
says
that
judge
strong
had
come
to
believe
in
his
own
prediction
or
at
least
fearing
that
his
prophecy
might
prove
true
refused
to
part
with
more
land
except
at
prices
that
would
be
justified
only
in
a
great
metropolis
neighboring
towns
that
were
born
when
corinth
was
flourished
and
have
become
cities
of
importance
the
country
round
about
has
grown
rich
and
prosperous
each
year
more
and
heavier
trains
thunder
past
on
their
way
to
and
from
the
great
city
by
the
distant
river
stopping
only
to
take
water
but
in
this
swiftly
moving
stream
of
life
corinth
is
caught
in
an
eddy
her
small
world
has
come
to
swing
in
a
very
small
circle
it
can
scarcely
be
said
to
swing
at
all
the
very
children
stop
growing
when
they
become
men
and
women
and
are
content
to
dream
the
dreams
their
fathers
fathers
dreamed
even
as
they
live
in
the
houses
the
fathers
of
their
fathers
built
only
the
trees
that
line
the
unpaved
streets
have
grown
grown
and
grown
until
overhead
their
great
tops
touch
to
shut
out
the
sky
with
an
arch
of
green
and
their
mighty
trunks
crowd
contemptuously
aside
the
old
sidewalks
with
their
decayed
and
broken
boards
old
town
a
mile
away
is
given
over
to
the
negroes
the
few
buildings
that
remain
are
fallen
into
ruin
save
as
they
are
patched
up
by
their
dusky
tenants
and
on
the
hill
the
old
academy
with
its
broken
windows
crumbling
walls
and
fallen
chimneys
stands
a
pitiful
witness
of
an
honor
and
dignity
that
is
gone
poor
corinth
so
are
gone
the
days
of
her
true
glory
the
glory
of
her
usefulness
while
the
days
of
her
promised
honor
and
power
are
not
yet
fulfilled
and
because
the
town
of
this
story
is
what
it
is
there
came
to
dwell
in
it
a
spirit
a
strange
mysterious
power
playful
vicious
deadly
a
something
to
be
at
once
feared
and
courted
to
be
denied
yet
confessed
in
the
denial
a
dreaded
enemy
a
welcome
friend
an
ally
but
for
corinth
the
humiliation
of
her
material
failure
is
forgotten
in
her
pride
of
a
finer
success
the
shame
of
commercial
and
civic
obscurity
is
lost
in
the
light
of
national
recognition
and
that
and
pride
of
place
without
which
neither
man
nor
town
can
look
the
world
in
the
face
is
saved
to
her
by
the
statesman
born
in
corinth
a
graduate
of
the
old
academy
town
clerk
mayor
county
clerk
state
senator
congressman
his
zeal
in
advocating
a
much
discussed
issue
of
his
day
won
for
him
national
notice
and
for
his
town
everlasting
fame
in
this
man
unusual
talents
were
combined
with
rare
integrity
of
purpose
and
purity
of
life
politics
to
him
meant
a
way
whereby
he
might
serve
his
fellows
however
much
men
differed
as
to
the
value
of
the
measures
for
which
he
fought
no
one
ever
doubted
his
belief
in
them
or
questioned
his
reasons
for
fighting
it
was
not
at
all
strange
that
such
a
man
should
have
won
the
respect
and
friendship
of
the
truly
great
but
with
all
the
honors
that
came
to
him
the
statesman
heart
never
turned
from
the
little
ozark
town
and
it
was
here
among
those
who
knew
him
best
that
his
influence
for
good
was
greatest
and
that
he
was
most
loved
and
honored
thus
all
that
the
railroad
failed
to
do
for
corinth
the
statesman
did
in
a
larger
finer
way
then
the
statesman
died
it
was
the
old
town
corinth
of
the
brick
academy
days
that
inspired
the
erection
of
a
monument
to
his
memory
but
it
was
the
corinth
of
the
newer
railroad
days
that
made
this
monument
of
and
under
the
portrait
figure
of
the
dead
statesman
this
newer
corinth
placed
in
letters
a
quotation
from
one
of
his
famous
speeches
upon
an
issue
of
his
day
the
doctor
argues
in
language
most
vigorous
that
the
broken
sidewalks
the
permitted
insolence
of
the
railroad
the
presence
and
power
of
that
spirit
the
ally
and
many
other
things
and
conditions
in
corinth
with
the
lack
of
as
many
other
things
and
conditions
are
all
due
to
the
influence
of
what
he
calls
that
hideous
monstrosity
by
this
it
will
be
seen
that
the
doctor
is
something
of
a
philosopher
the
monument
stands
on
the
corner
where
holmes
street
ends
in
strong
avenue
on
the
opposite
corner
the
doctor
lives
with
martha
his
wife
it
is
a
modest
home
for
there
are
no
children
and
the
doctor
is
not
rich
the
house
is
white
with
green
shutters
and
over
the
porch
climbs
a
mass
of
vines
the
steps
are
worn
very
thin
and
the
ends
of
the
are
rotted
badly
by
the
moisture
of
the
growing
vines
but
the
doctor
says
he
be
damned
if
he
pull
down
such
a
fine
old
vine
to
put
in
new
boards
and
that
those
will
last
anyway
longer
than
either
he
or
martha
by
this
it
will
be
seen
that
the
doctor
is
something
of
a
poet
on
the
rear
of
the
lot
is
the
and
stable
and
on
the
east
along
the
fence
in
front
and
down
the
holmes
street
side
are
the
doctor
roses
the
admiration
and
despair
of
every
housewife
in
town
full
fifty
years
of
the
doctor
professional
life
have
been
spent
in
active
practice
in
corinth
and
in
the
country
round
about
he
declares
himself
worn
out
now
and
good
for
nothing
save
to
meddle
in
the
affairs
of
his
neighbors
to
cultivate
his
roses
and
when
the
days
are
bright
to
go
fishing
for
the
rest
he
sits
in
his
chair
on
the
porch
and
watches
the
world
go
by
old
doctors
and
old
dogs
he
growls
how
equally
useless
we
are
and
yet
how
much
how
much
we
could
tell
if
only
we
dared
speak
he
is
big
is
the
doctor
big
and
fat
and
old
he
knows
every
soul
in
corinth
particularly
the
children
indeed
he
helped
most
of
them
to
come
to
corinth
he
is
acquainted
as
well
with
every
dog
and
cat
and
horse
and
cow
knowing
their
every
trick
and
habit
from
the
old
brindle
milker
that
unlatches
his
front
gate
to
feed
on
the
lawn
to
the
bull
pup
that
pinches
his
legs
when
he
calls
on
old
granny
brown
for
miles
around
every
road
lane
shortcut
and
trail
is
a
familiar
way
to
him
his
practice
he
declares
has
ruined
him
financially
and
totally
wrecked
his
temper
he
can
curse
a
man
and
cry
over
a
baby
and
he
would
go
as
far
and
work
as
hard
for
the
illiterate
and
penniless
backwoodsman
in
his
cabin
home
as
for
the
president
of
the
bank
of
corinth
or
even
judge
strong
himself
no
one
ever
thinks
of
the
doctor
as
loving
anyone
or
anything
and
that
is
because
he
is
so
big
and
rough
on
the
outside
but
every
one
in
trouble
goes
to
him
and
that
is
because
he
is
so
big
and
kind
on
the
inside
it
is
a
common
saying
that
in
cases
of
trying
illness
or
serious
accident
a
patient
would
rather
hear
the
doctor
cuss
than
listen
to
the
parson
pray
other
physicians
there
are
in
corinth
but
every
one
understands
when
his
neighbor
says
the
doctor
nor
does
anyone
ever
ever
call
him
doc
after
all
who
knows
the
people
of
a
community
so
well
as
the
physician
who
lives
among
them
to
the
world
the
doctor
patients
were
laborers
bankers
dressmakers
farmers
servants
teachers
preachers
to
the
doctor
they
were
men
and
women
others
knew
their
occupations
he
knew
their
lives
the
preachers
knew
what
they
professed
he
knew
what
they
practiced
society
saw
them
dressed
up
he
saw
them
in
bed
why
the
doctor
has
spent
more
hours
in
the
homes
of
his
neighbors
than
ever
he
passed
under
his
own
roof
and
there
is
not
a
skeleton
closet
in
the
whole
town
to
which
he
has
not
the
key
on
strong
avenue
across
from
the
monument
is
a
tiny
cottage
in
the
time
of
this
story
it
wanted
paint
badly
and
was
not
in
the
best
of
repair
but
the
place
was
neat
and
clean
with
a
big
lilac
bush
just
inside
the
gate
giving
it
an
air
of
privacy
and
on
the
side
directly
opposite
the
doctor
a
garden
giving
it
an
air
of
honest
thrift
here
the
widow
mulhall
lived
with
her
crippled
son
denny
denny
was
to
have
been
educated
for
the
priesthood
but
the
accident
that
left
him
such
a
hopeless
cripple
shattered
that
dream
and
after
the
death
of
his
father
who
was
killed
while
discharging
his
duties
as
the
town
marshal
there
was
no
money
to
buy
even
a
book
when
there
was
anything
for
her
to
do
deborah
worked
out
by
the
day
denny
in
spite
of
his
poor
misshapen
body
tended
the
garden
raising
such
vegetables
as
no
one
else
in
all
corinth
could
or
would
raise
from
early
morning
until
late
evening
the
lad
dragged
himself
about
among
the
growing
things
and
the
only
objects
to
mar
the
beauty
of
his
garden
were
denny
himself
and
the
great
rock
that
crops
out
in
the
very
center
of
the
little
field
it
is
altogether
too
bad
that
the
rock
should
be
there
the
neighbors
would
say
as
they
occasionally
stopped
to
look
over
the
fence
or
to
order
their
vegetables
for
dinner
and
denny
would
answer
with
his
knowing
smile
oh
i
do
know
it
would
be
bad
i
own
if
it
should
ever
take
to
rollin
like
but
it
lays
quiet
enough
and
do
you
see
i
planted
them
vines
around
it
to
make
it
a
bit
soft
lookin
and
there
a
nice
little
niche
on
yon
side
that
does
very
well
for
a
seat
now
and
then
when
i
have
to
rest
sometimes
when
the
doctor
looks
at
the
monument
the
image
of
his
old
friend
in
its
attitude
forever
delivering
that
speech
on
an
issue
as
dead
today
as
an
edict
of
one
of
the
pharaohs
he
laughs
and
sometimes
even
as
he
laughs
he
curses
but
when
in
the
days
of
the
story
the
doctor
would
look
across
the
street
to
where
denny
with
his
poor
twisted
body
useless
swinging
arm
and
dragging
leg
worked
away
so
cheerily
in
his
garden
the
old
physician
philosopher
and
poet
declared
that
he
felt
like
singing
hymns
of
praise
and
it
all
began
with
a
fishing
trip
chapter
ii
a
revelation
and
because
of
these
things
to
the
keen
old
physician
and
student
of
life
the
boy
was
a
revelation
of
that
best
part
of
himself
that
best
part
of
the
race
it
happened
on
the
doctor
first
trip
to
the
ozarks
martha
says
that
everything
with
the
doctor
begins
and
ends
with
fishing
martha
has
a
way
of
saying
such
things
as
that
in
this
case
she
is
more
than
half
right
for
the
doctor
does
so
begin
and
end
most
things
whenever
there
were
grave
cases
to
think
out
knotty
problems
to
solve
or
important
decisions
to
make
it
was
his
habit
to
steal
away
to
a
shady
nook
by
the
side
of
some
quiet
familiar
stream
and
he
confidently
asserts
that
to
this
practice
more
than
to
anything
else
he
owes
his
professional
success
and
his
reputation
for
sound
thoughtful
judgment
on
all
matters
of
moment
and
why
not
he
will
argue
when
in
the
mood
it
is
your
impulsive
erratic
thoughtless
fellow
who
goes
smashing
trashing
and
banging
about
the
field
and
woods
with
dogs
and
gun
your
true
thinker
slips
quietly
away
with
rod
and
line
and
while
his
hook
is
down
in
the
deep
still
waters
or
his
fly
is
dancing
over
the
foaming
rapids
and
swiftly
swirling
eddies
his
mind
searches
the
true
depths
of
the
matter
and
every
possible
phase
of
the
question
passes
before
him
for
years
the
doctor
had
heard
much
of
the
fishing
to
be
had
in
the
more
unsettled
parts
of
the
ozarks
but
with
his
growing
practice
he
could
find
leisure
for
no
more
than
an
occasional
visit
to
nearby
streams
but
about
the
time
that
martha
began
telling
him
that
he
was
too
old
to
stay
out
all
day
on
the
wet
bank
of
a
river
and
harry
had
come
to
relieve
him
of
the
heavier
and
more
burdensome
part
of
his
practice
a
railroad
pushed
its
way
across
the
mountain
wilderness
the
first
season
after
the
road
was
finished
the
doctor
went
to
cast
his
hook
in
new
waters
in
all
these
after
years
those
days
so
full
of
mystic
beauty
have
lived
in
the
old
man
memory
the
brightest
days
of
all
his
life
for
it
was
there
he
met
the
boy
there
in
the
ozark
hills
with
their
great
ridges
clothed
from
base
to
crest
with
trees
all
quivering
and
nodding
in
the
summer
breeze
with
their
quiet
valleys
their
cool
hollows
and
lovely
glades
and
their
deep
and
solemn
woods
and
the
streams
those
ozark
streams
the
doctor
wonders
often
if
there
can
flow
anywhere
else
such
waters
as
run
through
that
land
of
dreams
the
doctor
left
the
train
at
a
little
station
where
the
railroad
crosses
white
river
and
two
days
later
he
was
fishing
near
the
mouth
of
fall
creek
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
the
boy
was
passing
on
his
way
home
from
a
point
farther
up
the
stream
not
more
than
twelve
but
tall
and
strong
for
his
age
he
came
along
the
rough
path
at
the
foot
of
the
bluff
with
the
easy
movement
and
grace
of
a
young
deer
he
checked
a
moment
when
he
saw
the
doctor
as
a
creature
of
the
forest
would
pause
at
first
sight
of
a
human
being
then
he
came
on
again
his
manner
and
bearing
showing
frank
interest
and
the
clear
sunny
face
of
him
flushing
a
bit
at
the
presence
of
a
stranger
hello
said
the
doctor
with
gruff
kindness
any
luck
the
boy
quick
smile
showed
a
set
of
teeth
the
most
perfect
the
physician
had
ever
seen
and
his
young
voice
was
tuned
to
the
music
of
the
woods
as
he
answered
i
have
caught
no
fish
sir
by
these
words
and
the
light
in
his
brown
eyes
the
philosopher
knew
him
instantly
for
a
true
fisherman
he
noted
wonderingly
that
the
speech
was
not
the
rude
dialect
of
the
backwoods
while
he
marveled
at
the
depth
of
wisdom
in
one
so
young
how
incidental
after
all
is
the
catching
of
fish
to
the
one
who
fishes
with
true
understanding
the
boy
answer
was
both
an
explanation
and
a
question
it
explained
that
he
did
not
go
fishing
for
fish
alone
and
it
asked
of
the
stranger
a
declaration
of
his
standing
why
did
he
go
fishing
what
did
he
mean
by
fisherman
luck
the
doctor
deliberated
over
his
reply
while
slowly
drawing
in
his
line
to
examine
the
bait
meanwhile
the
boy
stood
quietly
by
regarding
him
with
a
wide
questioning
look
the
man
realized
that
much
depended
upon
his
next
word
then
the
lad
youth
betrayed
him
into
eagerness
have
you
been
farther
up
the
river
just
around
the
bend
where
the
giant
cottonwoods
are
and
the
bluffs
with
the
pines
above
and
the
willows
along
the
shore
oh
but
it
fine
there
much
better
than
this
he
had
given
the
stranger
his
chance
if
the
doctor
was
to
be
admitted
into
this
boy
world
he
must
now
prove
his
right
to
citizenship
looking
straight
into
the
boy
brown
eyes
the
older
fisherman
asked
a
better
place
to
catch
fish
he
laughed
aloud
a
clear
clean
boyish
laugh
of
understanding
and
throwing
himself
to
the
ground
with
the
easy
air
of
one
entirely
at
home
returned
no
sir
a
better
place
to
fish
so
it
was
settled
each
understanding
the
other
an
hour
later
when
the
shadow
of
the
mountain
came
over
the
water
the
boy
sprang
to
his
feet
with
an
exclamation
it
time
that
i
was
going
mother
likes
for
me
to
be
home
for
supper
i
can
just
make
it
but
the
doctor
was
loth
to
let
him
go
where
do
you
live
he
asked
is
it
far
oh
no
only
about
six
miles
but
the
trail
is
rough
until
you
strike
the
top
of
wolf
ridge
humph
you
ca
walk
six
miles
before
dark
my
horse
is
only
a
little
way
up
the
creek
he
answered
or
at
least
he
should
be
putting
his
fingers
to
his
lips
he
blew
a
shrill
whistle
which
echoed
and
from
shore
to
shore
along
the
river
and
was
answered
by
a
loud
neigh
from
somewhere
in
the
ravine
through
which
fall
creek
reaches
the
larger
stream
again
the
boy
whistled
and
a
black
pony
came
trotting
out
of
the
brush
the
bridle
hanging
from
the
saddle
horn
tramp
and
i
can
make
it
all
right
ca
we
old
fellow
said
the
boy
patting
the
glossy
neck
as
the
little
horse
rubbed
a
soft
muzzle
against
his
young
master
shoulder
while
his
companion
was
making
ready
for
his
ride
the
doctor
selected
four
of
the
largest
of
his
catch
black
bass
they
were
beauties
here
he
said
when
the
lad
was
mounted
take
these
along
he
accepted
graciously
without
hesitation
and
by
this
the
doctor
knew
that
their
fellowship
was
firmly
established
oh
thank
you
mother
is
so
fond
of
bass
and
so
are
father
and
all
of
us
this
is
plenty
for
a
good
meal
then
with
another
smile
mother
likes
to
fish
too
she
taught
me
the
doctor
looked
at
him
wistfully
as
he
gathered
up
the
reins
then
burst
forth
eagerly
with
look
here
why
ca
you
come
back
tomorrow
we
have
a
bully
time
what
do
you
say
he
lowered
his
hand
oh
i
would
like
to
then
for
a
moment
he
considered
gravely
saying
at
last
i
think
i
can
meet
you
here
day
after
tomorrow
i
am
quite
sure
father
and
mother
will
be
glad
for
me
to
come
when
i
tell
them
about
you
was
ever
a
fat
old
doctor
so
flattered
it
was
not
so
much
the
words
as
his
gracious
manner
and
the
meaning
he
unconsciously
put
into
his
exquisitely
toned
voice
he
had
turned
his
pony
head
when
the
old
man
shouted
after
him
once
more
hold
on
wait
a
moment
you
have
not
told
me
your
name
i
am
oldham
from
corinth
i
am
staying
at
the
thompson
down
the
river
my
name
is
daniel
howitt
matthews
he
answered
my
home
is
the
old
matthews
place
on
the
ridge
above
mutton
hollow
then
he
rode
away
up
the
winding
fall
creek
trail
the
doctor
spent
the
whole
of
the
next
day
near
the
spot
where
he
had
met
the
boy
fearing
lest
the
lad
might
come
again
and
not
find
him
he
even
went
a
mile
or
so
up
the
little
creek
half
expecting
to
meet
his
young
friend
wondering
at
himself
the
while
that
he
could
not
break
the
spell
the
lad
had
cast
over
him
who
was
he
he
had
told
the
doctor
his
name
but
that
did
not
satisfy
nor
indeed
did
the
question
itself
ask
what
the
old
man
really
wished
to
know
the
words
persistently
shaped
themselves
is
he
to
this
the
physician
brain
made
answer
clearly
enough
a
boy
a
backwoods
boy
with
unusual
beauty
and
strength
of
body
and
uncommon
fineness
of
mind
yet
with
all
this
a
boy
but
that
something
that
sits
in
judgment
upon
the
findings
of
our
brain
and
in
lofty
disregard
of
us
accepts
or
rejects
our
most
profound
conclusions
refused
this
answer
it
was
too
superficial
it
was
not
in
short
an
answer
it
did
not
in
any
way
explain
the
strange
power
that
this
lad
had
exerted
over
the
doctor
me
he
said
to
himself
a
hard
old
man
calloused
by
years
of
professional
contact
with
mankind
and
consequent
knowledge
of
their
general
cussedness
huh
i
have
helped
too
many
hundreds
of
children
into
this
world
and
have
carried
too
many
of
them
through
the
measles
and
the
like
to
be
so
moved
by
a
mere
boy
the
thompsons
could
have
told
him
about
the
lad
and
his
people
but
the
doctor
instinctively
shrank
from
asking
them
he
felt
that
he
did
not
care
to
be
told
about
the
boy
that
in
truth
no
one
could
tell
him
about
the
boy
because
he
already
knew
the
lad
as
well
as
he
knew
himself
indeed
the
feeling
that
he
already
knew
the
boy
was
what
troubled
the
doctor
more
that
he
had
always
lived
with
him
but
that
he
had
never
before
met
him
face
to
face
he
felt
as
a
blind
man
might
feel
if
after
living
all
his
life
in
closest
intimacy
with
someone
he
were
suddenly
to
receive
his
sight
and
for
the
first
time
actually
look
upon
his
companion
face
in
the
years
that
have
passed
since
that
day
the
doctor
has
learned
that
the
lad
was
to
him
not
so
much
a
mystery
as
a
revelation
the
revelation
of
an
unspoken
ideal
of
a
truth
that
he
had
always
known
but
never
fully
confessed
even
to
himself
and
that
lies
at
last
too
deeply
buried
beneath
the
accumulated
rubbish
of
his
life
to
be
of
any
use
to
him
or
to
others
in
the
boy
he
met
this
hidden
secret
unacknowledged
part
of
himself
that
he
knows
to
be
the
truest
most
precious
and
most
sacred
part
and
that
he
has
always
persistently
ignored
even
while
always
conscious
that
he
can
no
more
escape
it
than
he
can
escape
his
own
life
in
short
dan
matthews
is
to
the
doctor
that
which
the
old
man
feels
he
ought
to
have
been
that
which
he
might
have
been
but
never
now
can
be
it
was
still
early
in
the
forenoon
of
the
following
day
when
the
doctor
heard
a
cheery
hail
and
the
boy
came
riding
out
of
the
brush
of
the
little
ravine
to
meet
his
friend
who
was
waiting
on
the
river
bank
as
the
lad
sprang
lightly
to
the
ground
and
with
quick
fingers
took
some
things
from
the
saddle
loosed
the
girths
and
removed
the
pony
bridle
the
physician
watched
him
with
a
slight
feeling
of
was
it
envy
or
regret
you
are
early
he
said
the
boy
laughed
i
would
have
come
earlier
if
i
could
then
dismissing
the
little
horse
he
turned
eagerly
have
you
been
there
yet
to
that
place
up
the
river
indeed
i
have
not
said
the
doctor
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
to
show
me
he
was
delighted
at
this
and
very
soon
was
leading
the
way
along
the
foot
of
the
bluff
to
his
favorite
fishing
ground
it
is
too
much
to
attempt
the
telling
of
that
day
how
they
lay
on
the
ground
beneath
the
cottonwoods
and
listened
to
the
waters
going
past
how
they
talked
of
the
wild
woodland
life
about
them
of
flower
and
tree
and
moss
and
vine
and
the
creatures
that
nested
and
denned
and
lived
therein
how
they
caught
a
goodly
catch
of
bass
and
perch
and
the
doctor
pulling
off
his
boots
waded
in
the
water
like
another
boy
while
the
hills
echoed
with
their
laughter
and
how
when
they
had
their
lunch
on
a
great
rock
an
eagle
watched
hungrily
from
his
perch
on
a
dead
pine
high
up
on
the
top
of
the
bluff
when
the
shadow
of
the
mountain
was
come
once
more
and
in
answer
to
the
boy
whistle
the
black
pony
had
trotted
from
the
brush
to
be
made
ready
for
the
evening
ride
the
doctor
again
watched
his
young
companion
wistfully
when
he
was
ready
the
boy
said
father
and
mother
asked
me
to
tell
you
sir
that
they
that
we
would
be
glad
to
have
you
come
to
see
us
before
you
leave
the
hills
seeing
the
surprise
and
hesitation
of
the
doctor
he
continued
with
fine
tact
you
see
i
told
them
all
about
you
and
they
would
like
to
know
you
too
wo
you
come
i
sure
you
would
like
my
father
and
mother
and
we
would
be
so
glad
to
have
you
i
drive
over
after
you
tomorrow
if
you
come
would
he
why
the
doctor
would
have
gone
to
china
or
africa
or
where
would
he
not
have
gone
if
the
boy
had
asked
him
that
visit
to
the
matthews
place
was
the
beginning
of
a
friendship
that
has
never
been
broken
every
year
since
the
doctor
has
gone
to
them
for
several
weeks
and
always
with
increasing
delight
among
the
many
households
that
in
his
professional
career
he
has
been
privileged
to
know
intimately
this
home
stands
like
a
beautiful
temple
in
a
world
of
shacks
and
hovels
but
it
was
not
until
the
philosopher
had
heard
from
matthews
the
story
of
dad
howitt
that
he
understood
the
reason
in
the
characters
of
young
matt
and
sammy
in
their
home
life
and
in
their
children
the
physician
found
the
teaching
of
the
old
shepherd
of
the
hills
bearing
its
legitimate
fruit
most
clearly
did
he
find
it
in
dan
the
first
born
of
this
true
mating
of
a
man
and
woman
who
had
never
been
touched
by
those
forces
in
our
civilization
which
so
dwarf
and
cripple
the
race
but
who
had
been
taught
to
find
in
their
natural
environment
those
things
that
alone
have
the
power
to
truly
refine
and
glorify
life
understanding
this
the
doctor
understood
dan
the
boy
was
well
born
he
was
natural
he
was
what
a
ought
to
be
he
did
not
carry
the
handicap
that
most
of
us
stagger
under
so
early
in
the
race
and
because
of
these
things
to
the
keen
old
physician
and
student
of
life
the
boy
was
a
revelation
of
that
best
part
of
himself
that
best
part
of
the
race
with
the
years
this
feeling
of
the
doctor
toward
the
boy
has
grown
even
as
their
fellowship
but
dan
has
never
understood
how
indeed
could
he
it
was
always
dan
who
met
the
doctor
at
the
little
wilderness
station
and
who
said
the
last
when
the
visit
was
over
always
they
were
together
roaming
about
the
hills
on
fishing
trips
to
the
river
exploring
the
country
for
new
delights
or
revisiting
their
familiar
haunts
dan
seemed
in
his
quiet
way
to
claim
his
old
friend
by
right
of
discovery
and
the
others
laughingly
yielded
giving
the
doctor
as
young
matt
the
father
put
it
a
third
interest
in
the
boy
and
so
with
the
companionship
of
the
yearly
visits
and
frequent
letters
in
the
intervening
months
the
doctor
watched
the
development
of
his
young
friend
and
dreamed
of
the
part
that
dan
would
play
in
life
when
he
became
a
man
and
often
as
he
watched
the
boy
there
was
on
the
face
of
the
old
physician
that
look
of
half
envy
half
regret
in
addition
to
his
training
at
the
little
country
school
dan
mother
was
his
constant
teacher
passing
on
to
her
son
as
only
a
mother
could
the
truths
she
had
received
from
her
old
master
the
shepherd
but
when
the
time
came
for
more
advanced
intellectual
training
the
choice
of
a
college
was
left
to
their
friend
the
doctor
hesitated
he
shrank
from
sending
the
lad
out
into
the
world
he
foolishly
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
that
splendid
nature
coming
in
touch
with
the
filth
of
life
as
he
knew
it
you
can
see
he
argued
gruffly
what
it
has
done
for
me
but
sammy
answered
why
doctor
what
is
the
boy
for
and
young
matt
looking
away
over
garber
where
an
express
train
thundered
over
the
trestles
and
around
the
curves
said
in
his
slow
way
the
brush
is
about
all
cleared
doctor
the
wilderness
is
going
fast
the
boy
must
live
in
his
own
age
and
do
his
own
work
when
their
friend
urged
that
they
develop
or
sell
the
mine
in
the
cave
on
dewey
bald
and
go
with
the
boy
they
both
shook
their
heads
emphatically
saying
no
doctor
we
belong
to
the
hills
when
the
boy
finally
left
his
mountain
home
for
a
school
in
the
distant
city
he
had
grown
to
be
a
man
to
fill
the
heart
of
every
lover
of
his
race
with
pride
with
his
father
powerful
frame
and
muscles
and
the
healthy
life
of
the
woods
and
hills
leaping
in
his
veins
his
splendid
body
and
physical
strength
were
refined
and
dominated
by
the
mind
and
spirit
of
his
mother
his
shaggy
hair
was
like
his
father
but
his
eyes
were
his
mother
eyes
with
that
same
trick
of
expression
that
wide
questioning
gaze
that
seemed
to
demand
every
vital
truth
in
whatever
came
under
his
consideration
he
had
too
his
quick
way
of
grasping
your
thoughts
almost
before
you
yourself
were
fully
conscious
of
them
with
that
same
saving
sense
of
humor
that
made
sammy
lane
the
life
and
sunshine
of
the
countryside
big
dan
the
people
of
the
hills
had
come
to
call
him
and
big
dan
they
called
him
in
the
school
for
in
the
young
life
of
the
schools
as
in
the
country
there
is
a
spirit
that
names
men
with
names
that
fit
secretly
the
doctor
had
hoped
that
dan
would
choose
the
profession
so
dear
to
him
what
an
ideal
physician
he
would
make
with
that
clean
powerful
well
balanced
nature
and
above
all
with
that
love
for
his
race
and
his
passion
to
serve
mankind
that
was
the
dominant
note
in
his
character
the
boy
would
be
the
kind
of
a
physician
that
the
old
doctor
had
hoped
to
be
so
he
planned
and
dreamed
for
dan
as
he
had
planned
and
dreamed
for
himself
thinking
to
see
the
dreams
that
he
had
failed
to
live
realized
in
the
boy
it
was
a
severe
shock
to
the
doctor
when
that
letter
came
telling
him
of
dan
choice
of
a
profession
for
the
first
time
the
boy
had
disappointed
him
disappointed
him
bitterly
seizing
his
fishing
tackle
the
old
man
fled
to
the
nearest
stream
and
there
gazing
into
the
deep
still
waters
where
he
had
cast
his
hook
he
came
to
understand
it
was
that
same
dominant
note
in
the
boy
life
that
inborn
passion
to
serve
that
fixed
principle
in
his
character
that
his
life
must
be
of
the
greatest
possible
worth
to
the
world
that
had
led
him
to
make
his
choice
with
that
instinct
born
in
him
coming
from
the
influence
of
the
old
shepherd
upon
his
father
and
mother
the
boy
could
no
more
escape
it
than
he
could
change
the
color
of
his
brown
eyes
but
said
the
doctor
to
his
cork
that
floated
on
the
surface
in
a
patch
of
shadow
what
does
he
know
about
it
what
does
he
really
know
he
been
reading
history
that
what
the
matter
with
him
he
sees
things
as
they
were
not
as
they
are
he
should
have
come
to
me
i
could
have
just
then
the
cork
went
under
the
doctor
had
a
bite
i
could
have
told
him
repeated
the
fisherman
softly
i
the
cork
bobbed
up
again
it
was
only
a
nibble
he
find
out
the
truth
of
course
that
kind
but
when
he
finds
it
the
cork
bobbed
again
he
need
me
he
need
me
bad
the
cork
went
under
for
good
this
time
zip
and
the
doctor
had
a
big
one
with
fresh
bait
and
his
hook
once
more
well
down
toward
the
bottom
the
doctor
saw
the
whole
thing
clearly
and
so
planned
a
way
by
which
as
he
put
it
he
might
when
dan
needed
him
chapter
iii
a
great
day
in
corinth
of
the
responsibilities
of
age
humph
they
are
nothing
compared
to
the
responsibilities
of
youth
there
dan
now
corinth
was
in
the
midst
of
a
street
fair
the
neighboring
city
held
a
street
fair
that
year
therefore
corinth
all
that
the
city
does
corinth
imitates
thereby
with
a
beautiful
rural
simplicity
thinking
herself
metropolitan
just
as
those
who
take
their
styles
from
the
metropolis
feel
themselves
well
dressed
the
very
corinthian
clerks
and
grocery
boys
lounging
behind
their
counters
and
in
the
doorways
the
understudy
with
his
feet
on
the
window
sill
the
mechanic
apprentice
the
high
school
youths
and
the
local
sporting
fraternity
all
imitated
their
city
kind
and
talked
smartly
about
the
country
rubes
who
came
to
town
never
once
dreaming
that
they
themselves
when
they
go
to
town
are
as
much
a
mark
for
the
like
wit
of
their
city
brothers
so
corinth
was
in
the
midst
of
a
street
fair
on
every
vacant
lot
in
the
down
town
section
were
pens
and
stalls
and
cages
wherein
grunted
squealed
neighed
bellowed
bleated
cackled
and
crowed
exhibits
from
the
neighboring
farms
in
the
town
hall
or
opera
house
it
was
both
there
were
long
tables
covered
with
almost
everything
that
grows
on
a
farm
or
is
canned
baked
preserved
pickled
or
stitched
by
farmers
wives
the
art
exhibit
product
mainly
of
corinth
had
its
place
on
the
stage
upon
either
side
of
the
main
street
were
booths
containing
the
exhibits
of
the
local
merchants
farm
machinery
buggies
wagons
harness
and
the
like
being
most
conspicuous
the
chief
distinction
between
the
town
and
country
exhibits
were
that
the
farmer
displayed
his
goods
to
be
looked
at
the
merchant
his
to
be
sold
it
was
the
merchants
who
promoted
the
fair
in
a
vacant
store
room
the
memorial
church
was
holding
its
annual
bazaar
on
different
corners
other
churches
were
serving
chicken
dinners
or
ice
cream
or
in
sundry
ways
were
actively
engaged
for
the
conversion
of
the
erring
farmer
cash
to
the
coffers
of
the
village
sanctuaries
in
this
way
the
promoters
of
the
fair
were
encouraged
by
the
churches
from
every
window
door
arch
pole
post
corner
gable
peak
cupola
fluttered
streamed
and
waved
decorations
banners
mostly
bearing
advertisements
of
the
enterprising
merchants
and
of
the
equally
enterprising
churches
afternoons
there
would
be
a
baseball
game
between
town
and
country
teams
foot
races
horseback
riding
a
greased
pig
to
catch
a
greased
pole
to
climb
and
other
entertainments
too
exciting
to
think
about
too
attractive
to
be
resisted
from
the
far
backwoods
districts
from
the
hills
from
the
creek
bottoms
and
the
river
the
people
came
to
crowd
about
the
pens
and
stalls
and
tables
to
admire
their
own
and
their
neighbors
products
and
possessions
that
they
had
seen
many
times
before
in
their
homes
and
fields
they
visited
on
the
street
corners
they
tramped
up
and
down
past
the
booths
they
yelled
themselves
hoarse
at
the
games
and
entertainments
and
in
the
intoxication
of
their
pleasures
bought
ice
cream
chicken
dinners
and
various
other
things
of
the
churches
and
much
goods
of
the
merchants
who
promoted
the
fair
the
doctor
was
up
that
day
at
least
a
full
hour
before
his
regular
time
at
breakfast
martha
looked
him
over
suspiciously
and
when
he
folded
his
napkin
after
eating
only
half
his
customary
meal
she
remarked
dryly
it
three
hours
yet
till
train
time
doctor
without
answer
the
doctor
went
out
on
the
porch
already
the
country
people
dressed
in
their
holiday
garb
eager
for
the
long
looked
for
pleasures
were
coming
in
for
the
fair
many
of
them
catching
sight
of
the
physician
hailed
him
gaily
shouting
good
natured
remarks
in
addition
to
their
salutations
and
laughing
loudly
at
whatever
he
replied
it
may
be
that
the
good
lord
had
made
days
as
fine
as
that
day
but
the
doctor
could
not
remember
them
his
roses
so
filled
the
air
with
fragrance
the
grass
in
the
front
yard
was
so
fresh
and
clean
the
flowers
along
the
walk
so
bright
and
dainty
and
the
great
maples
that
make
a
green
arch
of
the
street
so
cool
and
mysterious
in
their
leafy
depths
that
his
old
heart
fairly
ached
with
the
beauty
of
it
the
doctor
was
all
poet
that
day
dan
was
coming
it
had
worked
out
just
as
the
doctor
had
planned
it
on
that
fishing
trip
some
three
months
before
at
first
martha
was
suspicious
when
he
broached
the
subject
mostly
martha
is
suspicious
when
her
husband
offers
suggestions
touching
certain
matters
but
the
wise
old
philosopher
knew
what
strings
to
pull
and
so
it
all
came
out
as
he
had
planned
sammy
had
written
him
expressing
her
gladness
that
her
boy
in
the
beginning
of
his
work
was
to
be
with
the
friend
whose
counsel
and
advice
they
valued
so
highly
the
doctor
had
growled
over
the
letter
promising
himself
that
he
would
stand
by
when
the
boy
needed
him
but
that
was
all
he
or
an
angel
from
heaven
could
do
now
and
the
doctor
had
written
dan
at
length
about
corinth
but
never
a
word
about
his
thoughts
regarding
the
boy
choice
or
his
fears
for
the
outcome
there
are
some
things
he
reflected
that
every
man
must
find
out
for
himself
to
some
kinds
of
people
the
finding
out
does
matter
much
to
other
kinds
it
is
well
for
them
if
there
are
those
who
love
them
to
stand
by
dan
was
the
kind
to
whom
the
finding
out
would
mean
a
great
deal
so
the
doctor
would
stand
by
there
on
his
vine
covered
porch
that
morning
the
old
man
thoughts
went
back
to
that
day
when
the
boy
first
came
to
him
on
the
river
bank
and
to
all
the
bright
days
of
dan
boyhood
and
youth
that
he
had
passed
with
the
lad
in
the
hills
his
life
said
he
talking
to
himself
as
he
has
a
way
of
doing
his
life
is
like
this
day
fresh
and
clean
and
he
looked
across
the
street
to
the
monument
that
stood
a
cold
lifeless
mask
in
a
world
of
living
joy
and
beauty
from
the
monument
he
turned
to
denny
garden
and
he
finished
full
of
possibilities
whatever
are
you
muttering
about
now
said
martha
who
had
followed
him
out
after
finishing
her
breakfast
i
was
wishing
said
the
doctor
that
i
that
it
would
be
always
morning
that
there
was
no
such
thing
as
afternoon
and
evening
and
night
his
wife
replied
sweetly
for
a
man
of
your
age
you
do
say
the
most
idiotic
things
wo
you
ever
get
old
enough
to
think
seriously
but
what
could
be
more
serious
my
dear
if
it
were
morning
i
would
always
be
beginning
my
life
work
and
never
giving
it
up
i
would
be
always
looking
forward
to
the
success
of
my
dreams
and
never
back
to
the
failures
of
my
poor
attempts
you
have
failed
in
everything
john
protested
martha
in
softer
tones
if
it
were
morning
the
philosopher
continued
with
a
smile
i
would
be
always
making
love
to
the
best
and
prettiest
girl
in
the
state
martha
tossed
her
head
and
the
ghost
of
an
old
blush
crept
into
her
wrinkled
cheeks
there
no
fool
like
an
old
fool
she
quoted
with
a
spark
of
her
girlhood
fire
but
a
young
fool
gets
so
much
more
out
of
his
foolishness
the
man
retorted
talk
of
the
responsibilities
of
age
humph
they
are
nothing
compared
to
the
responsibilities
of
youth
there
dan
now
he
looked
again
toward
the
monument
my
goodness
me
yes
ejaculated
martha
and
i
got
a
week
work
to
do
before
i
even
begin
to
get
dinner
you
go
right
off
this
minute
and
kill
three
of
those
young
roosters
three
mind
you
but
my
dear
he
will
only
be
here
for
dinner
never
you
mind
the
dinner
my
business
kill
three
i
tell
you
cooked
for
preachers
before
i
hope
to
the
lord
he
start
you
to
thinking
of
your
eternal
future
of
mooning
about
the
past
she
bustled
away
to
turn
the
little
home
upside
down
and
to
prepare
dinner
sufficient
for
six
when
the
doctor
had
killed
the
three
roosters
and
had
fussed
about
until
his
wife
ordered
him
out
of
the
kitchen
he
took
his
hat
and
stick
and
started
down
town
though
it
was
still
a
good
hour
until
train
time
as
he
opened
the
front
gate
denny
called
a
cheery
greeting
from
his
garden
across
the
street
and
the
old
man
went
over
for
a
word
with
the
crippled
boy
it
mighty
fine

lookin
this
mornin
doctor
said
denny
pausing
in
his
work
and
seating
himself
on
the
big
rock
is
it
the
he
comin
on
the
doctor
tried
to
appear
unconcerned
he
looked
at
his
watch
with
elaborately
assumed
carelessness
as
he
answered
i
believe
and
how
are
you
feeling
this
morning
denny
the
lad
lifted
his
helpless
left
arm
across
his
lap
oh

and
my
garden
doing

fair
and
the
preacher
a

too
the
doctor
looked
at
his
watch
again
and
denny
continued
we

pleased
at
his
comin

talked
of
anything

a
month

the

denny
the
poor
little
fellow
nearly
twisted
himself
off
the
rock
oh

the
minister

no
time
for
the
likes
of
me
and

there
he
nodded
his
head
toward
the
house
next
to
his
garden
that
his
room
the
other
answered
pointing
to
the
corner
window
he
be

at
the
window
with
the
look
of
a
worshiper

that
fine
is
it
grand
that
such
a
nice
room
doctor
it
has
such
a
fine
view
of
the
monument
yes
the
doctor
interrupted
the
monument
and
your
garden
and
then
he
left
abruptly
lest
he
should
foolishly
try
to
explain
to
the
bewildered
and
embarrassed
denny
what
he
meant
it
seemed
to
the
doctor
that
nearly
every
one
he
met
on
the
street
that
morning
had
a
smile
for
him
while
many
stopped
to
pass
a
word
about
the
coming
of
dan
when
he
reached
the
depot
the
agent
hailed
him
with
good
morning
doctor
looking
for
your
preacher
preacher
the
old
physician
glared
at
the
man
in
the
cap
and
turned
his
back
with
a
few
energetic
remarks
while
two
or
three
loafers
joined
in
the
laugh
and
a
couple
of
traveling
men
who
were
pacing
the
platform
with
bored
expressions
on
their
faces
turned
to
stare
at
him
curiously
at
the
other
end
of
the
platform
was
a
group
of
women
active
members
of
the
memorial
ladies
aid
who
had
left
their
posts
of
duty
at
the
bazaar
to
have
a
first
look
at
the
new
pastor
the
old
elder
nathan
jordan
with
charity
his
daughter
was
just
coming
up
good
morning
good
morning
doctor
said
nathan
grasping
his
hand
as
if
he
had
not
seen
him
for
years
well
i
see
we
all
here
he
turned
proudly
about
as
the
group
of
women
came
forward
with
an
air
of
importance
the
doctor
thought
as
though
the
occasion
required
their
presence
reckon
our
boy
be
here
all
right
nathan
continued
boy
the
doctor
caught
a
naughty
word
between
his
teeth
a
feat
he
rarely
accomplished
the
ladies
all
looked
sweetly
interested
one
of
them
putting
her
arm
lovingly
about
charity
cooed
so
nice
of
you
to
come
dear
she
had
remarked
to
another
a
moment
before
that
a
fire
would
keep
the
girl
away
from
the
depot
that
morning
the
doctor
felt
distinctly
the
subtle
invisible
presence
of
the
ally
and
it
was
well
that
someone
just
then
saw
the
smoke
from
the
coming
train
two
or
three
miles
away
around
the
curve
beyond
the
pumping
station
the
negro
porter
from
the
hotel
opposite
the
depot
came
bumping
across
the
rails
with
the
grips
belonging
to
the
two
traveling
men
in
his
little
cart
the
local
expressman
rattled
up
with
a
trunk
in
his
shaky
old
wagon
and
the
daughter
of
the
division
track
superintendent
hurried
out
of
the
red
with
a
bundle
of
big
envelopes
in
her
hand
the
platform
was
crowded
with
all
kinds
of
people
carrying
a
great
variety
of
bundles
baskets
and
handbags
asking
all
manner
of
questions
going
to
and
from
all
sorts
of
places
the
train
drew
rapidly
nearer
the
doctor
old
heart
was
thumping
painfully
he
forgot
the
people
he
forgot
corinth
he
forgot
everything
but
the
boy
who
had
come
to
him
that
day
on
the
river
bank
swiftly
the
long
train
with
clanging
bell
and
snorting
engine
came
up
to
the
depot
the
conductor
swung
easily
to
the
platform
and
watch
in
hand
walked
quickly
to
the
office
porters
and
trainmen
tumbled
off
and
with
a
long
hiss
of
escaping
air
and
a
steady
the
train
stopped
in
the
bustle
and
confusion
of
crowding
passengers
getting
on
and
off
tearful
and
joyful
greetings
banging
trunks
rattling
trucks
hissing
steam
the
doctor
watched
then
he
saw
him
his
handsome
head
towering
above
the
pushing
jostling
crowd
the
doctor
could
not
get
to
him
and
with
difficulty
restrained
a
shout
but
dan
with
his
back
to
them
all
pushed
his
way
to
an
open
window
of
the
car
he
had
just
left
where
a
woman
face
turned
to
him
in
earnest
conversation
there
he
is
said
the
doctor
that
tall
fellow
by
the
window
there
at
his
words
the
physician
heard
an
exclamation
and
glancing
back
saw
the
women
staring
eagerly
while
charity
face
wore
a
look
of
painful
doubt
and
disappointment
the
elder
countenance
was
stern
and
frowning
seems
mightily
interested
said
one
suggestively
what
a
pretty
face
added
another
also
suggestively
the
doctor
spoke
quickly
why
that
then
he
stopped
with
an
expression
on
his
face
that
came
very
near
being
a
malicious
grin
the
conductor
watch
again
in
hand
shouted
the
porters
stepped
aboard
the
bell
rang
the
engineer
with
his
long
swung
to
his
cab
slowly
the
heavy
train
began
to
gather
headway
as
it
went
dan
walked
along
the
platform
beside
that
open
window
until
he
could
no
longer
keep
pace
with
the
moving
car
then
with
a
final
wave
of
his
hand
he
stood
looking
after
the
train
seemingly
unconscious
of
everything
but
that
one
who
was
being
carried
so
quickly
beyond
his
sight
he
was
standing
so
when
his
old
friend
grasped
his
arm
he
turned
with
a
start
doctor
what
a
handsome
fellow
he
was
with
his
father
great
body
powerful
limbs
and
shaggy
hair
and
his
mother
eyes
and
mouth
and
her
spirit
ruling
within
him
making
you
feel
that
he
was
clean
through
and
through
it
was
no
wonder
people
stood
around
looking
at
him
the
doctor
felt
again
that
old
mysterious
spell
that
feeling
that
the
boy
was
a
revelation
to
him
of
something
he
had
always
known
the
living
embodiment
of
a
truth
never
acknowledged
and
his
heart
swelled
with
pride
as
he
turned
to
lead
dan
up
to
elder
jordan
and
his
company
the
church
ladies
old
in
experience
with
preachers
seemed
strangely
embarrassed
this
one
was
somehow
so
different
from
those
they
had
known
before
but
their
eyes
were
full
of
admiration
charity
voice
trembled
as
she
bade
him
welcome
nathaniel
manner
was
that
of
a
judge
dan
himself
was
as
calm
and
self
possessed
as
if
he
and
the
doctor
were
alone
on
the
bank
of
some
river
far
from
church
and
church
people
but
the
doctor
thought
that
the
boy
flinched
a
bit
when
he
introduced
him
as
reverend
matthews
perhaps
though
it
was
merely
the
doctor
fancy
the
old
man
felt
too
even
as
he
presented
dan
to
his
people
that
there
had
come
between
himself
and
the
boy
a
something
that
was
never
there
before
and
it
troubled
him
not
a
little
but
perhaps
this
too
was
but
a
fancy
at
any
rate
the
old
man
must
have
been
somewhat
excited
for
when
the
introductions
were
over
and
the
company
was
leaving
the
depot
he
managed
to
steer
dan
into
collision
with
a
young
woman
who
was
standing
nearby
she
was
carrying
a
small
grip
having
evidently
arrived
on
the
same
train
that
brought
the
minister
it
was
no
joke
for
anyone
into
whom
big
dan
bumped
and
a
look
of
indignation
flashed
on
the
face
but
the
indignant
look
vanished
quickly
in
a
smile
as
the
big
fellow
stood
hat
in
hand
offering
the
most
abject
apology
for
what
he
called
rudeness
the
doctor
noted
a
fine
face
a
strong
graceful
figure
and
an
air
of
wholesomeness
and
health
that
was
most
refreshing
but
he
thought
that
dan
took
more
time
than
was
necessary
for
his
apology
when
she
had
assured
the
young
fellow
several
times
that
it
was
nothing
she
asked
can
you
tell
me
please
the
way
to
abbott
office
abbott
the
doctor
own
office
harry
and
his
now
he
looked
the
young
woman
over
curiously
while
dan
was
saying
i
sorry
but
i
can
not
i
am
a
stranger
here
but
my
friend
the
older
man
interrupted
gruffly
with
the
necessary
directions
and
the
information
that
abbott
was
out
of
town
and
would
not
be
back
until
four
will
you
then
direct
me
to
a
hotel
she
asked
the
doctor
pointed
across
the
track
then
he
got
dan
away
the
church
ladies
with
charity
and
her
father
were
already
on
their
way
back
to
the
place
where
the
bazaar
was
doing
business
half
way
down
the
block
the
doctor
and
dan
were
checked
by
a
crowd
there
seemed
to
be
some
excitement
ahead
but
in
the
pause
dan
turned
to
look
back
toward
the
young
woman
who
had
arrived
in
corinth
on
the
same
train
that
had
brought
him
she
was
coming
slowly
down
the
street
toward
them
again
the
thought
flashed
through
the
doctor
mind
that
the
boy
had
taken
more
time
than
was
necessary
for
his
apology
chapter
iv
who
are
they
and
the
old
man
pointed
out
to
dan
his
room
across
the
way
the
room
that
looked
out
upon
the
garden
and
the
monument
jud
hardy
who
lives
at
windy
cove
on
the
river
some
eighteen
miles
back
from
corinth
had
been
looking
forward
to
fair
time
for
months
not
that
jud
had
either
things
to
exhibit
or
money
to
buy
things
exhibited
for
while
jud
professed
to
own
and
ostensibly
to
cultivate
a
forty
he
gained
his
living
mostly
by
occasional
spells
of
work
on
the
farms
of
his
neighbors
in
lieu
of
products
of
his
hand
or
fields
for
exhibition
at
the
annual
fair
jud
invariably
makes
an
exhibition
of
himself
never
failing
thus
to
contribute
his
full
share
to
the
other
amusements
announced
on
the
circulars
and
in
the
daily
corinthian
as
too
numerous
to
mention
the
citizens
of
the
windy
cove
country
have
a
saying
that
when
jud
is
sober
and
in
a
good
humor
and
has
money
he
is
a
fairly
good
fellow
if
he
is
not
crossed
in
any
way
the
meat
of
which
saying
is
in
the
well
known
fact
that
jud
is
never
in
a
good
humor
when
he
is
not
sober
that
he
is
never
sober
when
he
has
money
and
that
with
the
exception
of
three
or
four
kindred
spirits
whose
admiration
for
the
bad
man
is
equalled
only
by
their
fear
of
him
no
one
has
ever
been
able
to
devise
a
way
to
avoid
crossing
him
when
he
is
in
his
normal
condition
with
three
of
the
kindred
spirits
jud
arrived
in
corinth
that
day
with
the
earliest
of
the
visitors
and
the
quartette
proceeded
at
once
to
warm
up
after
their
long
ride
by
ten
they
were
well
warmed
just
as
the
train
was
slowing
up
at
the
depot
jud
began
his
exhibition
it
took
place
at
the
post
office
where
the
crowd
was
greatest
because
of
the
incoming
mail
stationing
himself
near
the
door
the
man
from
windy
cove
blocked
the
way
for
everyone
who
wanted
to
pass
either
in
or
out
of
the
building
for
the
women
and
young
girls
he
stepped
aside
with
elaborate
drunken
politeness
and
maudlin
complimentary
remarks
for
the
men
who
brushed
him
he
had
a
scowling
curse
and
a
muttered
threat
meanwhile
his
followers
nearby
looked
on
in
tipsy
admiration
and
that
there
was
bound
to
be
doin
for
jud
was
sure
trouble
then
came
one
who
politely
asked
jud
to
move
he
was
an
inoffensive
little
man
with
a
big
star
on
his
breast
and
a
big
walking
stick
in
his
hand
the
town
marshal
jud
saw
an
opportunity
to
give
an
exhibition
worth
while
there
were
a
few
opening
remarks
mostly
profane
and
then
the
representative
of
the
law
lay
in
a
huddled
heap
on
the
floor
while
the
man
from
the
river
rushed
from
the
building
into
the
street
the
passing
crowd
stopped
instantly
scattered
individuals
from
every
side
came
running
to
push
their
way
into
the
mass
of
men
and
women
until
for
a
block
on
either
side
of
the
thoroughfare
there
was
a
solid
wall
of
breathless
humanity
between
these
walls
strolled
jud
roaring
his
opinion
and
defiance
of
every
one
in
general
and
the
citizens
of
corinth
in
particular
it
could
not
last
long
of
course
there
were
many
men
in
the
crowd
who
did
not
fear
to
challenge
jud
but
there
was
that
inevitable
hesitation
while
each
man
was
muttering
to
his
neighbor
that
this
thing
ought
to
be
stopped
and
they
were
waiting
to
see
if
someone
else
would
not
start
first
to
stop
it
nearly
the
length
of
the
block
jud
made
his
triumphant
way
then
at
the
corner
where
the
crowd
was
not
so
dense
he
saw
a
figure
starting
across
the
street
hey
there
he
roared
get
back
there
where
you
belong
what
th
hell
do
you
mean
do
you
see
the
procession
a
comin
it
was
denny
he
had
left
his
garden
to
go
to
the
butcher
for
a
bit
of
meat
for
dinner
the
crippled
lad
had
just
rounded
the
corner
and
forced
to
give
all
his
attention
to
his
own
halting
steps
did
not
grasp
the
situation
but
continued
his
dragging
way
across
the
path
of
the
drunken
and
enraged
bully
the
ruffian
seeing
the
lad
ignore
his
loud
commands
strode
heavily
forward
with
menacing
fists
heaping
foul
epithets
upon
the
head
of
the
helpless
irish
boy
the
crowd
gasped
oh
why
does
someone
not
do
something
moaned
a
woman
a
girl
screamed
several
men
started
but
before
they
could
force
their
way
through
the
press
the
people
saw
a
stranger
a
young
giant
spring
from
the
sidewalk
and
run
toward
the
two
figures
in
the
middle
of
the
street
but
dan
had
not
arrived
upon
the
scene
soon
enough
almost
as
he
left
the
pavement
the
blow
fell
and
denny
lay
still
a
crumpled
pitiful
heap
in
the
dirt
jud
flushed
with
this
second
triumph
turned
to
face
the
approaching
stranger
come
on
you
dude
i
got
some
fer
you
too
come
git
your
medicine
you
dan
was
coming
coming
so
quickly
that
jud
curses
had
not
left
his
lips
when
the
big
fellow
reached
him
with
one
clean
swinging
blow
the
man
from
windy
cove
was
lifted
fairly
off
the
ground
to
fall
several
feet
away
from
his
senseless
victim
there
was
an
excited
yell
from
the
crowd
but
jud
lean
and
hard
of
sinew
had
the
physical
toughness
of
his
kind
almost
instantly
he
was
on
his
feet
again
reaching
for
his
hip
pocket
with
a
familiar
movement
and
there
was
a
wild
scramble
as
those
in
front
sought
cover
in
the
rear
look
out
look
out
came
from
the
crowd
but
the
mountain
bred
dan
needed
no
warning
with
a
leap
in
its
quickness
he
was
again
upon
the
other
there
was
a
short
struggle
a
sharp
report
a
wrenching
twist
a
smashing
blow
and
jud
was
down
once
more
this
time
senseless
the
weapon
lay
in
the
dust
the
bullet
had
gone
wide
the
crowd
yelled
their
approval
and
even
while
they
applauded
the
people
were
asking
each
of
his
neighbor
who
is
he
who
is
he
several
men
rushed
in
and
dan
seeing
the
bully
safe
in
as
many
hands
as
could
lay
hold
of
him
turned
to
discover
the
young
woman
whom
he
had
met
at
the
depot
kneeling
in
the
street
over
the
still
unconscious
denny
with
her
handkerchief
she
was
wiping
the
blood
and
dirt
from
the
forehead
dan
had
only
time
to
wonder
at
the
calmness
of
her
face
and
manner
when
the
crowd
closed
in
about
them
then
the
doctor
pushed
his
way
through
the
throng
and
the
people
at
sight
of
the
familiar
figure
obeyed
his
energetic
orders
and
drew
aside
a
carriage
was
brought
and
dan
lifted
the
unconscious
lad
in
his
arms
the
doctor
spoke
shortly
to
the
young
woman
you
come
too
and
with
the
doctor
the
two
strangers
in
corinth
took
denny
to
his
home
in
the
excitement
no
one
thought
of
introductions
while
the
people
seeing
their
hero
driving
in
the
carriage
with
a
young
woman
also
a
stranger
changed
their
question
from
who
is
he
to
who
are
they
when
denny
had
regained
consciousness
and
everything
possible
for
his
comfort
and
for
the
assistance
of
his
distracted
mother
had
been
done
and
the
physician
had
assured
them
that
the
lad
would
be
as
good
as
ever
in
a
day
or
two
the
men
crossed
the
street
to
the
little
white
house
well
ejaculated
martha
when
dan
had
been
presented
and
the
incident
on
the
street
briefly
related
i
mighty
glad
i
cooked
them
three
roosters
dan
laughed
his
big
hearty
laugh
i
glad
too
he
said
doctor
used
to
drive
me
wild
out
in
the
woods
with
tales
of
your
cooking
the
doctor
could
see
that
martha
was
pleased
at
this
by
the
way
she
fussed
with
her
apron
we
always
hoped
that
he
would
bring
you
with
him
on
some
of
his
trips
continued
dan
we
all
wanted
so
much
to
meet
you
to
the
doctor
astonishment
martha
stammered
i
maybe
i
will
go
some
day
then
her
manner
underwent
a
change
as
if
she
had
suddenly
remembered
something
you
excuse
me
now
while
i
put
the
dinner
on
she
said
stiffly
just
make
yourself
to
home
preachers
always
do
in
this
house
even
if
doctor
do
belong
she
hurried
away
and
dan
looked
at
his
host
with
his
mother
questioning
eyes
the
doctor
knew
what
it
was
dan
had
felt
it
even
in
the
house
of
his
dearest
friend
it
was
the
preacher
martha
had
welcomed
welcomed
him
professionally
because
he
was
a
preacher
and
the
doctor
felt
again
something
that
had
come
between
him
and
the
lad
martha
does
care
for
fishing
he
said
gently
then
they
went
out
on
the
porch
and
the
old
man
pointed
out
to
dan
his
room
across
the
way
the
room
that
looked
out
upon
the
garden
and
the
monument
several
of
your
congregation
wanted
to
have
you
in
their
homes
he
explained
but
i
felt
i
thought
you
might
like
to
be
it
was
near
me
you
see
and
handy
to
the
church
he
pointed
to
the
building
up
the
street
yes
dan
answered
looking
at
his
old
friend
curiously
such
broken
speech
was
not
natural
to
the
doctor
you
are
quite
right
it
was
very
kind
of
you
you
know
how
i
will
like
it
to
be
near
you
then
looking
at
the
monument
he
asked
whose
it
was
the
doctor
hesitated
again
dan
faced
him
waiting
for
an
answer
that
oh
that
our
statesman
you
will
need
time
to
fully
appreciate
that
work
of
art
and
what
it
means
to
corinth
it
will
grow
on
you
been
growing
on
me
for
several
years
the
young
man
was
about
to
ask
another
question
regarding
the
monument
when
he
paused
the
girl
who
had
gone
to
denny
in
the
street
was
coming
from
the
little
cottage
as
she
walked
away
under
the
great
trees
that
lined
the
sidewalk
the
two
men
stood
watching
her
dan
question
about
the
monument
was
forgotten
i
wonder
who
she
is
he
said
in
a
low
voice
the
doctor
recalled
the
meeting
at
the
depot
and
chuckled
and
just
then
martha
called
to
dinner
and
the
people
on
the
street
corners
at
the
ladies
bazaar
in
the
stores
the
church
booths
and
in
the
homes
were
talking
talking
of
the
exhibition
of
the
man
from
windy
cove
and
asking
each
of
his
neighbor
who
are
they
chapter
hope
farwell
ministry
useful
hands
they
were
made
for
real
service
after
dinner
was
over
and
they
had
visited
awhile
the
doctor
introduced
dan
to
his
landlady
across
the
way
and
making
some
trivial
excuse
about
business
left
the
boy
in
his
room
the
fact
is
that
the
doctor
wished
to
be
alone
if
he
could
have
done
it
decently
he
would
have
gone
off
somewhere
with
his
fishing
tackle
as
he
could
not
go
fishing
he
did
the
next
best
thing
he
went
to
his
office
the
streets
were
not
so
crowded
now
for
the
people
were
at
the
ball
game
and
the
doctor
made
his
way
down
town
without
interruption
as
he
went
he
tried
to
think
out
what
it
was
that
had
come
between
him
and
the
boy
whom
he
had
known
so
intimately
for
so
many
years
stopping
at
the
post
office
he
found
a
letter
in
his
care
addressed
to
rev
daniel
h
matthews
in
his
abstraction
he
was
about
to
hand
the
letter
in
at
the
window
with
the
explanation
that
he
knew
no
such
person
when
a
voice
at
his
elbow
said
is
brother
matthews
fully
rested
from
his
tiresome
journey
doctor
the
doctor
abstraction
vanished
instantly
he
jammed
that
letter
into
his
pocket
and
faced
the
speaker
yes
he
growled
i
think
brother
matthews
is
fully
rested
as
he
is
a
grown
man
of
unusual
strength
and
in
perfect
health
of
body
at
least
and
the
tiresome
journey
was
a
trip
of
only
four
hours
in
a
comfortable
railway
coach
i
think
i
may
say
that
he
is
fully
recovered
then
the
doctor
slipped
away
but
he
had
discovered
what
it
was
that
had
come
between
the
boy
and
himself
the
dan
matthews
was
no
longer
the
doctor
boy
he
was
reverend
brother
the
all
the
morning
it
had
been
making
itself
felt
that
something
that
sets
preachers
apart
the
doctor
wondered
how
his
young
giant
would
stand
being
coddled
and
petted
and
loved
by
the
wives
and
mothers
of
men
who
for
their
daily
bread
met
the
world
and
whose
hardships
were
accepted
by
them
and
by
these
same
mothers
and
wives
as
a
matter
of
course
by
this
time
the
doctor
had
reached
his
office
and
the
sight
of
the
familiar
old
rooms
that
had
been
the
scene
of
so
many
revelations
of
real
tragedies
and
genuine
hardships
known
only
to
the
sufferer
and
to
him
professionally
forced
him
to
continue
his
thought
there
was
harry
for
instance
who
beside
his
old
negro
housekeeper
ever
petted
and
coddled
who
ever
thought
of
setting
him
apart
whoever
asked
if
he
were
rested
from
his
tiresome
journey
journeys
made
not
in
comfortable
coaches
on
the
railroad
but
in
his
buggy
over
all
kinds
of
roads
at
all
times
of
day
or
night
in
all
sorts
of
weather
winter
and
summer
rain
and
sleet
and
snow
whoever
or
him
oh
no
he
was
only
a
man
a
physician
it
was
his
business
to
kill
himself
trying
to
keep
other
people
alive
harry
abbott
had
been
first
the
doctor
assistant
then
his
partner
and
now
at
last
his
successor
of
a
fine
old
southern
family
his
people
had
lost
everything
in
the
war
when
harry
was
only
a
lad
the
father
was
killed
in
battle
and
the
mother
died
a
year
later
leaving
the
boy
alone
in
the
world
thrown
upon
his
own
resources
for
the
necessities
of
life
he
had
managed
somehow
to
live
and
to
educate
himself
besides
working
his
way
through
both
preparatory
and
medical
schools
choosing
his
profession
for
love
of
it
he
came
to
oldham
from
school
when
the
doctor
was
beginning
to
feel
the
burden
of
his
large
practice
too
heavily
and
it
was
while
he
was
the
old
assistant
that
the
people
learned
to
call
him
harry
and
harry
he
is
to
this
day
how
that
boy
has
worked
his
profession
and
his
church
for
he
is
a
member
a
deacon
now
in
the
memorial
church
have
occupied
every
working
minute
of
his
life
and
many
hours
beside
that
he
should
have
given
to
sleep
as
the
months
passed
oldham
placed
more
and
more
responsibilities
upon
him
and
at
the
end
of
the
second
year
took
him
into
full
partnership
it
was
about
this
time
that
harry
bought
the
old
wilson
carter
place
and
brought
from
his
boyhood
home
two
former
slaves
of
his
father
to
keep
house
for
him
old
uncle
george
and
his
wife
mam
liz
every
year
the
younger
man
took
more
and
more
of
the
load
from
his
partner
shoulders
until
the
older
physician
retired
from
active
practice
and
never
has
there
been
a
word
but
of
confidence
and
friendship
between
them
their
only
difference
is
that
harry
will
go
to
prayer
meeting
when
the
doctor
declares
he
should
go
to
bed
and
that
he
will
not
go
fishing
always
he
has
been
the
same
courteous
kindly
gentleman
intent
only
upon
his
profession
keeping
abreast
of
the
new
things
pertaining
to
his
work
but
ever
considerate
of
the
old
whims
and
fancies
even
now
that
oldham
has
stepped
down
and
out
harry
insists
that
he
leave
his
old
desk
in
its
place
and
still
talks
over
his
cases
with
him
the
doctor
was
sitting
in
his
dilapidated
office
chair
thinking
over
all
this
when
he
heard
his
brother
physician
step
on
the
stairs
harry
came
in
dusty
and
worn
from
a
long
ride
in
the
country
on
an
case
his
tired
face
lit
up
when
he
saw
his
friend
hello
doctor
glad
to
see
you
has
he
come
how
is
he
while
he
was
speaking
the
physician
dropped
his
case
slipped
out
of
his
coat
and
was
in
the
lavatory
burying
his
face
in
cold
water
by
the
time
the
other
was
ready
to
answer
that
was
harry
he
was
never
in
a
hurry
never
seemed
to
move
fast
but
people
never
ceased
to
wonder
at
his
quickness
he
all
right
the
doctor
muttered
his
mind
slipping
back
into
the
channel
that
had
started
him
off
to
thinking
of
his
fellow
physician
got
in
on
the
but
you
look
fagged
enough
why
the
devil
you
rest
harry
standing
in
the
doorway
rubbing
his
face
neck
and
chest
with
a
coarse
towel
the
young
man
laughed
rest
what
would
i
do
with
a
vacation
be
all
right
when
i
get
outside
of
one
of
mam
liz
dinners
it
was
that
baby
of
jensen
that
kept
me
poor
little
chap
i
thought
two
or
three
times
he
was
going
to
make
a
die
of
it
sure
but
i
guess
he
pull
through
now
oldham
knew
the
jensens
well
eighteen
miles
over
the
worst
roads
in
the
country
he
growled
hoarsely
it
be
more
years
than
there
are
miles
between
here
and
jensen
before
you
get
a
cent
out
of
that
case
you
a
fool
for
making
the
trip
why
do
you
let
get
that
old
bushwhacker
at
salem
he
only
three
miles
away
harry
pulled
on
his
coat
and
dropped
into
his
chair
with
a
grin
you
give
me
to
collect
some
of
your
old
accounts
doctor
the
jensens
say
that
the
reason
they
have
me
is
because
you
have
always
been
their
physician
then
the
doctor
in
characteristic
language
expressed
his
opinion
of
the
whole
jensen
tribe
while
harry
calmly
glanced
through
some
letters
on
his
desk
see
here
doctor
he
exclaimed
wheeling
around
in
his
chair
and
interrupting
the
old
man
eloquent
discourse
here
is
a
letter
from
dr
miles
says
he
is
sending
a
nurse
just
what
we
want
he
tossed
the
letter
to
the
other
there
be
the
deuce
to
pay
at
judge
when
she
arrives
whew
i
guess
i
better
trot
over
home
and
get
a
bite
and
forty
winks
a
jensen
breakfast
as
you
may
remember
is
just
the
most
staying
thing
for
a
civilized
stomach
and
i
need
to
be
fit
when
i
call
at
the
strong
mansion
wonder
when
the
nurse
will
get
here
she
here
now
said
the
old
doctor
and
he
then
told
him
about
the
meeting
at
the
depot
and
the
fight
on
the
street
but
go
on
and
get
your
nap
he
finished
i
look
after
her
harry
had
just
taken
his
hat
when
there
came
a
knock
on
the
door
leading
into
the
little
waiting
room
he
hung
his
hat
back
in
the
closet
and
dropped
into
his
chair
again
with
a
comical
expression
of
resignation
on
his
face
but
his
voice
was
cheerful
when
he
said
come
in
the
door
opened
the
young
lady
of
the
depot
entered
the
old
physician
took
a
good
look
at
her
this
time
he
saw
a
girl
of
fine
strong
form
and
good
height
with
clear
skin
showing
perfect
health
large
gray
eyes
serious
enough
but
with
a
laugh
back
of
all
their
seriousness
brown
hair
firm
rounded
chin
and
a
generous
sensitive
mouth
particularly
he
noticed
her
hands
beautifully
modeled
useful
hands
they
were
made
for
real
service
altogether
she
gave
him
the
impression
of
being
very
much
alive
and
very
much
a
woman
is
this
dr
abbott
she
asked
looking
at
harry
who
had
risen
from
his
chair
when
she
spoke
the
old
man
again
noted
her
voice
it
was
low
and
clear
i
am
abbott
replied
harry
i
am
hope
farwell
she
answered
dr
miles
you
know
asked
me
to
come
you
wanted
a
nurse
for
a
special
case
i
believe
oh
yes
exclaimed
harry
we
have
the
letter
here
we
were
just
speaking
of
you
miss
farwell
this
is
oldham
perhaps
dr
miles
told
you
of
him
she
turned
with
a
smile
yes
indeed
dr
miles
told
me
i
believe
we
have
met
before
doctor
the
girl
broke
into
a
merry
laugh
when
the
old
man
answered
gruffly
i
should
think
we
had
i
was
just
telling
harry
there
when
you
came
in
then
the
younger
physician
asked
how
soon
can
you
be
ready
to
go
on
this
case
nurse
she
looked
at
him
with
a
faint
expression
of
surprise
why
i
ready
now
doctor
and
the
old
doctor
broke
in
so
savagely
that
they
both
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
as
he
said
but
this
is
a
hard
case
you
be
up
most
of
the
night
you
tired
out
from
your
trip
why
doctor
said
the
young
woman
it
is
my
business
to
be
ready
at
any
time
being
up
nights
is
part
of
my
profession
surely
you
know
that
besides
that
trip
was
really
a
good
rest
the
first
good
rest
i
had
for
a
long
time
i
know
of
course
he
answered
i
was
thinking
of
something
else
you
must
pardon
me
miss
harry
there
will
explain
that
i
am
subject
to
these
little
attacks
oh
i
know
already
she
returned
smiling
dr
miles
told
me
all
about
you
and
there
was
something
in
her
laughing
gray
eyes
that
made
the
rough
old
man
wonder
just
what
it
was
that
his
friend
miles
had
told
her
all
right
get
back
to
business
you
two
he
growled
i
not
interrupt
again
tell
her
about
the
case
harry
the
young
woman
face
was
serious
in
a
moment
and
she
gave
the
physician
the
most
careful
attention
as
he
explained
the
case
for
which
he
had
written
dr
miles
to
send
a
trained
nurse
of
certain
qualifications
the
judge
strong
of
this
story
is
an
only
son
of
the
old
judge
who
moved
corinth
he
is
a
large
man
physically
as
large
as
the
doctor
but
where
the
doctor
is
fat
the
judge
is
lean
he
inherited
not
only
his
title
a
purely
honorary
one
but
his
father
property
his
position
as
an
elder
in
the
church
and
his
general
disposition
together
with
his
taste
and
skill
in
collecting
mortgages
and
acquiring
real
estate
the
old
judge
had
but
the
one
child
the
judge
of
this
story
though
just
passing
middle
age
has
no
children
at
all
seemingly
there
is
no
room
in
his
heart
for
more
than
his
church
and
his
properties
his
mind
being
thus
wholly
occupied
with
titles
to
heaven
and
to
earth
with
sapphira
his
wife
he
lives
in
a
big
house
on
strong
avenue
beyond
the
strong
memorial
church
with
never
so
much
as
a
pet
dog
or
cat
to
roughen
the
lawn
or
romp
perchance
in
the
garden
the
patient
whom
miss
farwell
had
come
to
nurse
was
sapphira
sister
a
widow
with
neither
child
nor
home
the
judge
had
been
forced
by
his
fear
of
public
sentiment
to
give
her
shelter
and
he
had
been
compelled
by
oldham
and
harry
to
employ
a
nurse
the
case
would
not
be
a
pleasant
one
miss
farwell
would
need
all
that
abundant
stock
of
tact
and
patience
which
dr
miles
had
declared
she
possessed
all
this
harry
explained
to
her
and
when
he
had
finished
she
asked
in
the
most
tone
and
what
are
your
instructions
doctor
that
caught
harry
it
caught
the
old
doctor
too
not
even
a
comment
on
the
disagreeable
position
she
knew
she
would
have
in
the
strong
household
for
harry
had
not
slighted
the
hard
facts
she
understood
clearly
what
she
was
going
into
a
light
came
into
the
young
physician
eyes
that
his
old
friend
liked
to
see
i
guess
miles
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
in
his
letter
said
the
old
doctor
and
the
young
woman
face
flushed
warmly
at
his
words
and
look
then
in
his
professional
tones
harry
instructed
her
more
fully
as
to
the
patient
condition
a
nervous
trouble
greatly
aggravated
by
the
judge
disposition
nice
job
is
it
miss
farwell
harry
finished
she
smiled
when
do
i
go
on
doctor
harry
stepped
to
the
telephone
and
called
up
the
strong
mansion
this
you
judge
he
said
into
the
instrument
the
nurse
from
chicago
is
here
came
today
we
want
her
to
go
on
the
case
at
once
can
you
send
your
man
to
the
depot
for
her
trunk
by
the
look
on
his
face
the
old
doctor
knew
what
harry
was
getting
the
younger
physician
jaw
was
set
and
his
eyes
were
blazing
but
his
voice
was
calm
and
easy
but
judge
you
remember
the
agreement
oldham
is
here
now
if
you
wish
to
speak
to
him
we
shall
hold
you
to
the
exact
letter
of
your
bargain
judge
i
am
very
sorry
but
very
well
sir
i
will
be
at
your
home
with
the
nurse
in
a
few
moments
please
have
a
room
ready
and
by
the
way
judge
i
must
tell
you
again
that
my
patient
is
in
a
serious
condition
i
warn
you
that
we
will
hold
you
responsible
if
anything
happens
to
interfere
with
our
arrangements
for
her
treatment
he
turned
to
the
nurse
with
a
wry
face
it
pretty
bad
miss
farwell
then
ringing
up
the
village
drayman
he
arranged
to
have
the
young
woman
trunk
taken
to
the
house
when
the
man
had
called
for
the
checks
harry
said
now
nurse
my
buggy
is
here
and
if
you
are
ready
i
guess
we
had
better
follow
your
trunk
pretty
closely
from
the
window
the
old
doctor
watched
them
get
into
the
buggy
and
drive
off
down
the
street
mechanically
he
opened
the
letter
from
dr
miles
which
he
still
held
in
his
hand
an
ideal
nurse
who
has
taken
up
the
work
for
love
of
it
have
known
the
family
for
years
thoroughbreds
just
the
kind
to
send
a
kentuckian
like
you
i
warn
you
look
out
i
want
her
back
again
the
doctor
chuckled
when
he
remembered
harry
look
as
he
talked
to
the
young
woman
if
ever
a
man
needed
a
wife
harry
does
he
thought
who
knows
what
might
happen
who
knows
indeed
then
the
doctor
went
home
to
dan
he
found
him
in
denny
garden
with
denny
enthroned
on
the
big
rock
listening
to
his
fun
while
deborah
from
the
house
looked
on
unable
to
believe
that
it
was
the
parson
sure
enough
out
there
wid
denny
denny
who
was
to
have
been
a
priest
himself
one
day
but
who
would
never
now
be
good
for
much
of
anything
chapter
vi
the
calling
of
dan
matthews
the
battle
of
life
we
can
not
hire
a
substitute
whatever
work
one
volunteers
to
make
his
own
he
must
look
upon
as
his
ministry
to
the
race
dan
with
the
doctor
and
oldham
were
to
take
supper
and
spend
the
evening
at
elder
jordan
martha
went
over
early
in
the
afternoon
leaving
the
two
men
to
follow
as
they
were
passing
the
monument
dan
stopped
did
you
know
him
he
asked
curiously
when
he
had
read
the
inscription
it
was
not
like
dan
to
be
curious
the
doctor
answered
briefly
i
was
there
when
he
was
born
and
was
his
family
physician
all
his
life
and
i
was
with
him
when
he
died
something
in
the
doctor
voice
made
dan
look
at
him
intently
for
a
moment
then
in
a
low
tone
he
was
a
good
man
one
of
the
best
i
ever
knew
too
good
for
this
town
look
at
that
thing
they
say
that
expressed
their
appreciation
of
him
and
it
does
he
finished
grimly
but
said
dan
in
a
puzzled
way
turning
once
more
to
the
monument
this
inscription
he
read
again
the
sentence
from
the
speech
on
the
forgotten
issue
of
his
passing
day
the
doctor
said
nothing
then
gazing
up
at
the
figure
posed
stiffly
with
outstretched
arm
in
the
attitude
of
a
public
speaker
dan
asked
is
that
like
him
like
him
it
like
nothing
but
the
people
who
conceived
it
growled
the
doctor
indignantly
if
that
man
were
living
he
would
not
be
always
talking
about
issues
that
have
no
meaning
at
this
day
he
would
be
giving
himself
to
the
problems
that
trouble
us
now
this
thing
he
rapped
the
monument
with
his
stick
until
it
gave
forth
a
dull
hollow
sound
this
thing
is
not
a
memorial
to
the
life
and
character
of
my
friend
it
memorializes
the
dead
issue
to
which
he
gave
himself
at
one
passing
moment
of
his
life
and
which
had
he
lived
he
would
have
forgotten
as
the
changing
times
brought
new
issues
to
be
met
as
he
met
this
old
one
he
was
too
great
too
brave
to
ever
stand
still
and
let
the
world
go
by
he
was
always
on
the
firing
line
this
thing
he
rapped
the
hollow
iron
shaft
again
contemptuously
and
the
hollow
sound
seemed
to
add
emphasis
to
his
words
this
is
a
dead
monument
to
a
dead
issue
instead
of
speaking
of
his
life
it
cries
aloud
in
hideous
emphasis
that
he
is
dead
they
stood
silently
for
a
moment
then
dan
said
quietly
after
all
doctor
they
meant
well
and
that
retorted
the
old
man
grimly
is
what
we
doctors
say
when
we
see
our
mistakes
go
by
in
the
hearse
they
went
on
up
the
street
until
they
reached
the
church
here
dan
stopped
again
he
read
the
inscription
cut
large
in
the
stone
over
the
door
the
strong
memorial
church
again
dan
turned
to
his
friend
inquiringly
judge
strong
the
old
judge
explained
the
doctor
that
his
picture
in
the
big
window
there
in
all
his
intentions
nathaniel
jordan
was
one
of
the
best
of
men
surely
if
in
the
hereafter
any
man
receives
credit
for
always
doing
what
his
conscience
dictates
nathan
will
he
was
one
of
those
characters
who
give
up
living
ten
years
before
they
die
nathan
stayed
on
for
the
church
good
miss
charity
the
elder
only
child
is
well
she
was
born
raised
and
educated
for
a
parson
wife
the
doctor
says
that
she
did
even
cry
like
other
babies
at
three
she
had
taken
a
prize
in
sunday
school
for
committing
golden
texts
at
seven
she
was
baptized
and
knew
the
reason
why
at
twelve
she
played
the
organ
in
christian
endeavor
at
fourteen
she
was
teaching
a
class
leading
prayer
meeting
attending
conventions
was
president
of
the
local
union
and
pointed
with
pride
to
the
fact
that
she
was
on
more
committees
than
any
other
single
individual
in
the
memorial
church
the
walls
of
her
room
were
literally
covered
with
badges
medals
tokens
prizes
and
emblems
with
the
picture
of
every
conspicuous
church
worker
and
leader
of
her
denomination
between
times
the
girl
studied
the
early
history
of
her
church
read
the
religious
papers
and
in
other
ways
fitted
herself
for
her
life
work
poor
charity
she
was
so
cursed
with
a
holy
ambition
that
to
her
men
were
not
men
they
simply
or
were
preachers
when
dan
and
the
doctor
reached
the
jordan
home
they
found
this
daughter
of
the
church
at
the
front
gate
watching
for
them
a
look
of
eager
hope
and
expectancy
on
her
face
the
elder
himself
with
his
wife
and
oldham
were
on
the
front
porch
martha
could
scarcely
wait
for
the
usual
greeting
and
the
introduction
of
dan
to
jordan
before
she
opened
on
the
doctor
with
it
a
great
pity
doctor
that
you
could
bring
brother
matthews
here
before
the
last
possible
minute
supper
is
ready
right
now
a
body
would
think
you
had
an
important
case
if
they
know
that
you
were
too
old
to
do
anything
any
more
we
did
have
an
important
case
my
dear
the
doctor
replied
and
it
was
dan
who
caused
our
delay
that
it
lay
it
on
to
somebody
else
like
you
always
do
what
in
the
world
could
poor
brother
matthews
be
doing
to
keep
him
from
a
good
meal
he
was
studying
let
me
see
what
was
it
dan
art
political
economy
or
theology
dan
smiled
i
think
it
might
have
been
the
theory
and
practice
of
medicine
he
returned
at
which
they
both
laughed
and
the
others
joined
in
though
for
his
life
the
doctor
could
see
why
well
said
the
elder
when
he
had
finished
his
shrill
cackle
we
better
go
in
and
discuss
supper
awhile
that
always
a
satisfactory
subject
at
least
which
was
a
pretty
good
one
for
nathaniel
when
the
meal
was
finished
they
all
went
out
on
the
front
porch
again
where
it
soon
became
evident
that
nathaniel
did
not
propose
to
waste
more
time
in
light
and
frivolous
conversation
by
his
familiar
and
ponderous
ahem
ahem
even
dan
understood
that
he
was
anxious
to
get
down
to
the
real
business
of
the
evening
and
that
he
was
determined
to
do
his
full
duty
or
as
he
would
have
said
to
keep
that
which
was
committed
unto
him
ahem
ahem
a
hush
fell
upon
the
little
company
the
women
turned
their
chairs
expectantly
and
the
doctor
slipped
over
to
the
end
of
the
porch
to
enjoy
his
evening
cigar
the
elder
had
the
field
with
another
and
still
louder
ahem
he
began
i
am
sorry
that
brother
strong
is
not
here
this
evening
judge
strong
that
is
brother
matthews
he
is
our
other
elder
you
understand
i
expected
him
but
he
has
evidently
been
detained
the
doctor
thinking
of
harry
and
the
nurse
chuckled
and
nathan
turned
a
look
of
solemn
inquiry
in
his
direction
ahem
ahem
you
did
not
come
to
corinth
directly
from
your
home
i
understand
brother
matthews
the
doctor
could
see
dan
face
by
the
light
from
the
open
window
he
fancied
it
wore
a
look
of
amused
understanding
no
answered
the
minister
i
spent
yesterday
in
the
city
ahem
ahem
coughed
the
elder
found
an
acquaintance
on
the
train
coming
up
did
you
we
noticed
you
talking
to
a
young
woman
at
the
car
window
dan
paused
a
moment
before
answering
and
the
doctor
could
feel
the
interest
of
the
company
then
the
boy
said
dryly
yes
i
may
say
though
that
she
is
something
more
than
an
acquaintance
smothered
exclamations
from
the
women
ah
hah
from
the
elder
the
doctor
grinned
to
himself
in
the
dark
the
young
scamp
ahem
she
had
a
pretty
face
we
noticed
are
you
that
is
have
you
known
her
long
several
years
sir
the
lady
you
saw
is
my
mother
i
went
with
her
to
the
city
day
before
yesterday
where
she
wished
to
do
some
shopping
and
accompanied
her
on
her
way
home
as
far
as
corinth
more
exclamations
from
the
women
why
doctor
you
never
told
us
it
was
his
mother
cried
martha
and
nathaniel
turned
toward
the
end
of
the
porch
with
a
look
of
righteous
indignation
you
never
asked
me
chuckled
the
doctor
after
this
the
two
older
women
drifted
into
the
house
charity
settled
herself
in
an
attitude
of
rapt
attention
and
the
program
was
continued
ahem
you
may
not
be
aware
of
it
brother
matthews
but
i
know
a
great
deal
about
your
family
sir
indeed
exclaimed
dan
yes
sir
you
see
i
have
some
mining
interests
in
that
district
quite
profitable
interests
i
may
say
judge
strong
and
i
together
have
quite
extensive
interests
two
or
three
years
ago
we
made
a
good
many
trips
into
your
part
of
the
country
where
we
heard
a
great
deal
of
your
people
your
mother
seems
to
be
a
remarkable
woman
of
considerable
influence
too
bad
she
is
not
a
regular
member
of
the
church
our
preachers
often
tell
us
and
i
believe
it
is
true
that
people
who
do
so
much
good
out
of
the
church
really
injure
the
cause
more
than
anything
else
dan
made
no
answer
to
this
but
as
the
doctor
saw
his
face
in
the
light
it
wore
a
mingled
expression
of
astonishment
and
doubt
the
elder
proceeded
they
used
to
tell
us
some
great
stories
about
your
father
too
big
man
is
he
yes
sir
fairly
good
size
yes
i
remember
some
of
his
fights
we
used
to
hear
about
and
there
was
another
member
of
the
family
they
mentioned
a
good
deal
dad
dad
howitt
said
dan
softly
that
it
howitt
a
kind
of
a
shepherd
was
he
discovered
the
big
mine
on
your
father
place
one
of
your
father
fights
was
about
the
old
man
ahem
ahem
i
judge
you
take
after
your
father
i
do
know
just
what
to
think
about
your
whipping
that
fellow
this
morning
someone
had
to
do
something
of
course
but
ahem
for
a
minister
it
was
rather
unusual
i
do
know
how
the
people
will
take
it
i
afraid
that
i
forgot
that
i
was
a
minister
said
dan
uneasily
i
hope
sir
you
do
not
think
that
i
did
wrong
ahem
ahem
i
ca
say
that
it
was
wrong
exactly
but
as
i
said
we
do
know
how
the
people
will
take
it
but
there
one
thing
sure
and
the
elder
shrill
cackle
rang
out
it
will
bring
a
big
crowd
to
hear
you
preach
well
well
that
off
the
subject
ahem
brother
matthews
why
have
your
people
opened
that
big
mine
in
dewey
bald
i
expect
it
would
be
better
for
me
to
let
father
or
mother
explain
that
to
you
sir
answered
dan
as
cool
and
calm
as
the
evening
yes
yes
of
course
but
it
rather
strange
rather
unusual
you
know
to
find
a
young
man
of
your
and
opportunities
for
wealth
entering
the
ministry
you
could
educate
a
great
many
preachers
sir
if
you
would
develop
that
mine
father
and
mother
have
always
taught
us
children
that
in
the
battle
of
life
one
can
not
hire
a
substitute
that
whatever
work
one
volunteers
to
make
his
own
he
must
look
upon
as
his
ministry
to
the
race
i
believe
that
the
church
is
an
institution
divinely
given
to
serve
the
world
and
that
more
than
any
other
it
helps
men
to
the
highest
possible
life
i
volunteered
for
the
work
i
have
undertaken
because
naturally
i
wish
my
life
to
count
for
the
greatest
possible
good
and
because
i
feel
that
i
can
serve
men
better
in
the
church
than
in
any
other
way
whew
thought
the
doctor
that
was
something
for
nathan
to
chew
on
the
lad
face
when
he
spoke
made
his
old
friend
nerves
tingle
his
was
a
new
conception
of
the
ministry
new
to
the
doctor
at
least
forgetting
his
cigar
he
awaited
the
elder
reply
with
breathless
interest
ahem
ahem
you
feel
then
that
you
have
no
special
divine
call
to
the
work
i
have
always
been
taught
at
home
sir
that
every
man
is
divinely
called
to
his
work
if
that
work
is
for
the
good
of
all
men
his
faithfulness
or
unfaithfulness
to
the
call
is
revealed
in
the
that
prompt
him
to
choose
his
field
the
boy
paused
a
moment
and
then
added
slowly
and
no
one
who
heard
him
could
doubt
his
deep
conviction
yes
sir
i
feel
that
i
am
divinely
called
to
preach
the
gospel
ahem
ahem
i
trust
brother
matthews
that
you
are
not
taken
up
with
these
new
fads
and
fancies
that
are
turning
the
minds
of
the
people
from
the
true
worship
of
god
it
is
my
desire
sir
to
lead
people
to
the
true
worship
of
god
i
believe
that
nothing
will
accomplish
that
end
but
the
simple
old
jerusalem
gospel
the
doctor
lit
his
cigar
again
they
seemed
to
be
getting
upon
safer
ground
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
said
the
elder
heartily
very
glad
i
feared
from
the
way
you
spoke
you
might
be
going
astray
there
is
a
great
work
for
you
here
in
corinth
a
great
work
our
old
brother
who
preceded
you
was
a
good
man
sound
in
the
faith
in
every
way
but
he
did
seem
to
take
somehow
the
fact
is
the
other
churches
ahem
are
getting
about
all
our
congregation
then
for
an
hour
or
more
elder
jordan
for
the
new
minister
benefit
discussed
in
detail
the
religious
history
of
corinth
with
the
past
present
and
future
of
memorial
church
while
charity
drinking
in
every
word
of
the
discussion
grew
ever
more
entranced
with
the
possibilities
of
the
new
pastor
ministry
and
the
doctor
sat
alone
at
the
farther
end
of
the
porch
the
elder
finished
with
well
well
brother
matthews
you
are
young
strong
unmarried
and
with
your
reputation
as
a
college
man
and
an
athlete
you
ought
to
do
great
things
for
memorial
church
we
are
counting
on
you
to
build
us
up
wonderfully
and
let
me
say
too
that
we
are
one
of
the
oldest
and
best
known
congregations
in
our
brotherhood
here
in
the
state
we
have
had
some
great
preachers
here
you
can
make
a
reputation
that
will
put
you
to
the
top
of
your
ah
calling
dan
was
just
saying
i
hope
i
will
please
you
sir
when
the
women
appeared
in
the
doorway
martha
had
her
bonnet
on
come
come
nathan
said
jordan
you
must
keep
poor
brother
matthews
up
another
minute
he
must
be
nearly
worn
out
with
his
long
journey
and
all
the
excitement
the
doctor
thought
again
of
the
girl
who
had
made
the
same
journey
in
the
car
behind
dan
and
who
had
also
shared
the
excitement
he
wondered
how
the
nurse
was
enjoying
her
evening
and
when
she
would
get
to
bed
that
so
exclaimed
the
doctor
rising
to
his
feet
we
all
a
lot
of
brutes
to
treat
the
poor
boy
so
dan
whirled
on
him
with
a
look
that
set
the
old
man
to
laughing
all
right
sonny
he
chuckled

nathaniel
jordan
prediction
proved
true
in
the
two
days
between
dan
arrival
and
his
first
sunday
in
corinth
the
ally
was
actively
engaged
in
making
known
the
identity
of
the
big
stranger
who
had
so
skillfully
punished
the
man
from
windy
cove
also
the
name
and
profession
of
the
young
woman
who
had
gone
to
assistance
were
fully
revealed
the
new
minister
of
the
memorial
church
was
the
sensation
of
the
hour
the
building
could
scarcely
hold
the
crowd
while
the
rival
churches
were
deserted
save
only
by
the
few
faithful
pillars
who
were
held
in
their
places
by
the
deep
conviction
that
heaven
itself
would
fall
should
they
fail
to
support
their
own
particular
faith
with
the
people
who
had
attended
the
fair
the
ally
journeyed
far
into
the
country
and
the
roads
being
good
with
promise
of
a
moon
to
drive
home
by
the
country
folk
for
miles
around
came
to
worship
god
and
incidentally
to
see
the
preacher
who
had
fought
and
vanquished
the
celebrated
jud
many
were
there
that
day
who
had
not
been
inside
a
church
before
for
years
the
ally
went
also
but
then
the
ally
they
say
is
a
regular
attendant
at
all
the
services
of
every
church
judge
strong
with
an
expression
of
pious
satisfaction
on
his
hard
face
occupied
his
own
particular
corner
from
another
corner
elder
jordan
watched
for
signs
of
false
doctrine
charity
except
when
busy
at
the
organ
never
took
her
adoring
eyes
from
the
preacher
face
at
the
last
moment
before
the
sermon
harry
slipped
into
the
seat
beside
the
doctor
and
many
other
earnest
souls
there
were
who
depended
upon
the
church
as
the
only
source
of
their
life
inspiration
and
strength
facing
this
crowd
that
even
in
the
small
town
of
corinth
represented
every
class
and
kind
dan
felt
it
all
the
vulgar
curiosity
the
craving
for
sensation
the
admiration
the
suspicion
the
true
welcome
the
antagonism
the
spiritual
dependence
and
the
young
man
from
the
mountains
and
the
schools
who
had
entered
the
ministry
from
the
truest
motives
with
the
highest
ideals
shrank
back
and
was
afraid
dan
was
literally
to
this
church
and
people
a
messenger
from
another
world
it
was
not
strange
that
many
of
the
people
thought
how
out
of
place
this
big
fellow
looks
in
the
pulpit
many
of
them
felt
dimly
too
that
which
the
doctor
had
always
felt
that
this
man
was
somehow
a
revelation
of
something
that
might
have
been
that
ought
to
be
but
no
one
tried
to
search
out
the
reason
why
the
theme
of
the
new
minister
sermon
was
the
faith
of
the
fathers
and
it
must
have
been
a
good
one
because
martha
said
the
next
day
that
it
was
the
finest
thing
she
had
ever
heard
and
she
had
it
figured
out
somehow
that
the
members
of
neighboring
churches
who
were
there
got
some
straight
gospel
for
once
in
their
lives
elder
jordan
assured
the
doctor
in
a
confidential
whisper
that
it
was
a
splendid
effort
the
doctor
knew
that
dan
was
splendid
and
he
could
see
that
the
boy
had
fairly
hypnotized
the
crowd
but
he
could
not
understand
why
it
should
have
been
much
of
an
effort
he
confided
to
martha
that
so
far
as
he
could
see
the
sermon
might
have
been
taken
from
the
barrel
of
any
one
of
the
preachers
that
had
served
the
memorial
church
since
its
establishment
but
the
sermon
was
new
and
fresh
to
dan
and
so
gained
something
of
interest
and
strength
from
the
earnestness
and
personality
of
the
speaker
the
boy
had
only
to
hold
that
gait
reflected
the
doctor
and
he
would
as
nathan
had
said
land
at
the
very
top
of
his
profession
in
the
evening
the
doctor
slipped
away
from
church
as
soon
as
the
services
were
over
leaving
dan
with
those
who
always
stay
until
the
janitor
begins
turning
out
the
lights
martha
would
walk
home
with
fellow
workers
in
the
ladies
aid
who
lived
a
few
doors
beyond
and
the
doctor
wished
to
be
alone
crossing
the
street
to
avoid
the
crowd
he
walked
slowly
along
under
the
big
trees
trying
to
accustom
himself
to
the
thought
of
his
boy
dressed
in
the
conventional
minister
garb
delivering
time
worn
conventionalities
in
a
manner
as
conventional
it
was
to
this
strange
thinking
old
man
almost
as
if
he
had
seen
dan
behind
the
grated
doors
of
a
prison
cell
very
slowly
he
went
along
unmindful
of
aught
but
the
thoughts
that
troubled
him
until
coming
to
the
widow
mulhall
little
cottage
where
deborah
and
denny
were
sitting
on
the
porch
he
paused
across
the
street
in
front
of
his
own
home
martha
and
her
friends
were
holding
an
animated
conversation
come
in
come
in
doctor
called
deborah
cheery
voice
it
a
fine
evenin
it
is
and
only
beginnin
i
was
just
tellin
denny
that
is
a
shame
folks
have
to
waste
such
nights
in
sleep
come
right
in
fetch
another
chair
take
the
big
rocker
there
doctor
that
right
and
how
are
you
denny
oh
the
bye
is
all
right
again
just
as
you
said
sure
the
minister
had
him
out
in
the
garden
that
same
afternoon
was
the
blessin
of
god
though
that
his
reverence
was
there
to
keep
that
devil
from
batin
the
poor
lad
to
death
i
hope
you
not
be
the
way
to
our
gate
entirely
now
doctor
that
you
be
crossin
the
street
so
often
to
the
house
beyond
the
garden
there
in
the
widow
voice
there
was
a
hint
of
her
irish
ancestry
as
in
her
kind
blue
eyes
buxom
figure
and
cordial
manner
there
was
more
than
a
hint
of
her
nature
how
do
you
like
your
new
neighbor
deborah
asked
the
doctor
ah
doctor
it
a
fine
big
man
he
is
a
danged
fine
man
inside
an
out
denny
and
me
are
almighty
proud
havin
him
so
close
he
that
sociable
too
not
at
all
like
a
priest
it
every
blessed
day
since
he
been
here
he
comin
over
to
denny
in
the
garden
and
helpin
him
with
the
things
away
all
the
time
the
very
exercise
i
need
says
he
it
a
real
kindness
for
ye
to
let
me
work
a
bit
now
and
then
says
he
but
sure
we
kin
see
is
the
big
heart
of
him
wishful
to
help
the
bye
but
it
queer
notioned
he
is
fer
a
preacher
did
i
see
you
and
denny
at
church
this
evening
asked
the
doctor
you
did
that
sir
you
see
not
havin
no
church
of
our
own
within
reach
of
our
legs
an
bein
real
wishful
to
hear
a
bit
of
a
prayer
and
a
sermon
like
denny
an
me
slips
into
the
protestant
meetings
now
and
then
after
all
there
no
real
harm
in
it
now
do
you
think
doctor

to
you
and
denny
or
the
church
the
doctor
asked

side
of
the
street
and

i
misdoubt
if

tell

whole
thing
but
for
myself
i
niver
heard
a
blessed
word
after
the

the
preacher
stood
up
why
what
was
the
matter
the
preacher

the
preacher
yes

this
way

upon
my

up
there
so
big
an
strong
an
an
clean
like
through
an
through

the
very
image
of
him
i
always
knowed
he
was
to
grow
up
another
jack
for
strength
looks
and
you
know
yourself
how
our
hearts
was
set
on
havin

deborah
with

and
wood
and
groceries
to

to
say
nothin
of
the
interest
that
always
comin
due
we
whist
said
denny
in
a
low
tone
as
a
light
flashed
up
in
the
corner
window
of
the
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
garden
there
the
minister
come
home
reverently
they
watched
the
light
and
the
moving
shadow
in
the
room
the
moon
through
the
branches
of
the
trees
along
the
street
threw
waving
patches
of
soft
light
over
the
dark
green
of
the
little
lawn
friends
had
moved
on
martha
herself
had
retired
the
street
was
seemingly
deserted
and
very
still
leaning
forward
in
her
chair
deborah
spoke
in
a
whisper
we
can
always
tell
when
he
in
of
nights
and
when
he
goes
to
bed
ye
see
it
almost
like
we
was
livin
in
the
same
house
with
him
an
a
great
comfort
it
is
to
us
too
wid
him
such
a
good
man
our
havin
him
so
near
poor

i
warrant

tonight
but
oh

must
be
a
grand
thing
doctor
to
be
doin
such
holy
work
an
a
livin
with
god
almighty
like
with
nothin
to
think
of
all
the
time
but
the
blessed
jesus
and
the
holy
mother
an
all
the
people
so
respectful
an
lookin
up
to
you

grand
thing
doctor
to
be
a
priest
savin
your
presence
sir
for
i
know
how
you
little
truck
wid
churches
tho
the
lady
your
wife
does
enough
fer
two
the
doctor
rose
to
go
for
he
saw
that
the
hour
was
late
as
he
stood
on
the
steps
ready
to
depart
the
steady
flow
of
deborah
talk
continued
when
denny
interrupted
again
pointing
toward
a
woman
who
was
crossing
to
the
other
side
of
the
street
she
walked
slowly
and
reaching
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
doctor
house
hesitated
in
a
troubled
undecided
way
approaching
the
gate
she
paused
then
drew
back
and
moved
on
slowly
up
the
street
her
movements
and
manner
gave
the
impression
that
she
was
in
trouble
perhaps
in
pain
there
something
wrong
there
said
the
doctor
who
is
it
can
you
see
who
it
is
denny
yes
sir
he
answered
and
deborah
broke
in
it
that
poor
girl
of
of
jim
conner
sir
the
doctor
at
once
nervous
and
agitated
was
not
a
little
worried
and
could
make
no
reply
knowing
that
it
was
jim
conner
who
had
killed
deborah
husband
poor
thing
murmured
deborah
for
the
love
of
god
look
at
that
now
doctor
the
girl
had
reached
the
corner
and
had
fallen
or
thrown
herself
in
a
crouching
heap
against
the
monument
the
widow
was
starting
for
the
street
but
denny
caught
her
arm
no
no
mother
you
must
do
that
you
know
how
she
scared
to
death
of
you
let
the
doctor
go
the
physician
was
already
on
his
way
as
fast
as
his
old
legs
would
take
him
chapter
viii
the
work
of
the
ally
in
the
little
room
that
looked
out
upon
the
monument
and
the
garden
dan
all
unknowing
slept
and
over
all
brooded
the
spirit
that
lives
in
corinth
the
ally
that
dread
mysterious
thing
that
never
sleeps
grace
conner
is
a
type
common
to
every
village
town
and
city
in
the
land
the
saddest
of
all
sad
creatures
a
good
girl
with
a
bad
reputation
her
reputation
grace
owed
first
to
her
father
misdeeds
for
which
the
girl
could
in
no
way
be
to
blame
and
second
to
the
ally
without
whom
the
making
of
any
reputation
good
or
bad
is
impossible
the
doctor
knew
the
girl
well
when
she
was
a
little
tot
and
a
member
of
martha
sunday
school
class
she
was
at
the
house
frequently
later
as
a
member
of
the
church
she
herself
was
a
teacher
and
an
active
worker
then
came
the
father
crime
and
conviction
followed
soon
by
the
mother
death
and
the
girl
was
left
to
shift
for
herself
she
had
kept
herself
alive
by
working
here
and
there
in
the
canning
factory
and
restaurants
and
wherever
she
could
no
one
would
give
her
a
place
in
a
home
the
young
people
in
the
church
imitating
their
elders
shunned
her
and
it
was
not
considered
good
policy
to
permit
her
to
continue
teaching
in
the
sunday
school
no
mother
wanted
her
child
to
associate
with
a
criminal
daughter
naturally
she
drifted
away
from
the
regular
services
and
soon
it
was
publicly
announced
that
her
name
had
been
dropped
from
the
roll
of
membership
after
that
she
never
came
it
was
not
long
until
the
girl
had
such
a
name
that
no
self
respecting
man
or
woman
dared
be
caught
recognizing
her
on
the
street
the
people
always
spoke
of
her
as
that
grace
conner
the
girl
hurt
so
often
grew
to
fear
everyone
she
strove
to
avoid
meeting
people
on

or
meeting
them
passed
with
downcast
eyes
not
daring
to
greet
them
barely
able
to
earn
bread
to
keep
life
within
her
poor
body
her
clothing
grew
shabby
her
form
thin
and
worn
and
these
very
evidences
of
her
goodness
of
character
worked
to
accomplish
her
ruin
but
she
was
a
good
girl
through
it
all
a
good
girl
with
a
bad
reputation
she
was
cowering
at
the
foot
of
the
monument
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
when
the
doctor
touched
her
on
the
shoulder
she
started
and
turned
up
to
him
the
saddest
face
the
old
physician
had
ever
seen
what
the
matter
my
girl
he
said
as
kindly
as
he
could
she
shook
her
head
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
again

and

me
alone

the
doctor
laying
his
hand
on

shoulder
again

the
street
at
this
time
of
the
night
at
his
tone
she
raised
her
head
again
this
time
of
the
night
what
difference
does
it
make
to
anyone
whether
i
am
on
the
street
or
not
it
makes
a
big
difference
to
you
my
girl
the
doctor
answered

be
home
and
in
bed
god
what
a
laugh
she
gave
home
in
bed
she
laughed
again

said
the
physician
sharply
for
he
saw
that
just
a
touch
more
and
she
would
be
over
the
line
stand
up
here
and
tell
me

matter

rose
to
her
feet
with
his
help

wrung

hands
and
looked
about

a
dazed
way
but
answered

the
physician

but
why
did
you
leave
your
place
at
the
hotel
a
a
man
there
said
something
that
i
did
like
and
then
the
proprietor
told
me
that
i
must
go
because
some
of
the
people
were
talking
about
me
and
i
was
giving
the
hotel
a
bad
name

hesitated

say
it
the
same
everywhere

try
to
work
she
continued
in
a
hopeless
tone
at
the
canning
factory
the
other
girls
said
their
folks
let
them
work
there
if
i
did
go
i
have
been
able
to
earn
a
cent
since
i
left
the
hotel

what
to

she
broke
down
crying
look
here
why
did
you
come
to
me
the
doctor
asked
roughly
you
knew
you
could
come
to
me
did
i
tell
you
to
i
i
was
afraid
i
afraid
of
everybody
she
shivered
and
looked
over
her
shoulder
the
doctor
saw
that
this
thing
had
gone
far
enough
come
with
me
he
said
you
must
have
something
to
eat
he
started
to
lead
her
across
the
street
toward
mulhall
whom
he
could
see
at
the
gate
watching
them
but
the
girl
hung
back
no
no
she
panted
in
her
excitement
not
there
i
dare
not
go
there
the
doctor
hesitated
well
come
to
my
house
then
he
said
she
went
as
far
as
the
gate
then
she
stopped
again
i
ca
doctor
oldham
i
ca
the
girl
was
right
the
doctor
was
never
so
ashamed
in
all
his
life
after
a
little
he
said
with
decision
look
here
grace
you
sit
down
on
the
porch
for
a
few
minutes
martha
is
in
bed
and
fast
asleep
long
ago
he
stole
away
as
quietly
as
possible
and
in
a
little
while
returned
with
a
basket
full
of
such
provisions
as
he
could
find
in
the
pantry
he
was
chuckling
to
himself
as
he
thought
of
martha
when
she
discovered
the
theft
in
the
morning
and
cursing
half
aloud
the
thing
that
made
it
necessary
for
him
to
steal
from
his
own
pantry
for
the
girl
whom
he
would
have
taken
into
his
home
so
gladly
if
he
made
her
eat
some
of
the
cold
chicken
and
bread
and
drink
a
glass
of
milk
and
when
she
was
feeling
better
walked
with
her
down
the
street
a
little
way
to
be
sure
that
she
was
all
right
i
ca
thank
you
enough
doctor
she
said
you
have
saved
me
from
do
try
he
broke
in
he
did
not
want
her
to
get
on
that
line
again
go
on
home
like
a
good
girl
now
and
mind
you
look
carefully
in
the
bottom
of
that
basket
he
had
put
a
little
bill
there
the
only
money
he
had
in
the
house
this
will
help
until
times
are
better
for
you
and
mind
now
if
you
run
against
it
again
come
to
me
or
go
to
harry
at
the
office
and
tell
him
that
you
want
me
he
watched
her
down
the
street
and
then
went
home
stopping
for
a
word
of
explanation
to
deborah
and
denny
who
were
waiting
at
the
gate
the
light
was
still
burning
in
dan
window
when
the
doctor
again
entered
his
own
yard
he
thought
once
that
he
would
run
in
on
the
minister
for
a
minute
and
then
remembered
that
the
boy
would
be
tired
after
his
great
effort
defending
the
faith
of
memorial
church
it
was
long
past
the
old
man
bed
time
he
told
himself
that
he
was
an
old
fool
to
be
prowling
about
so
late
at
night
and
that
he
would
hear
from
martha
all
right
tomorrow
then
as
he
climbed
into
bed
he
chuckled
again
thinking
of
the
empty
kitchen
pantry
and
that
missing
basket
the
light
in
dan
room
went
out
some
belated
person
passed
going
home
for
the
night
a
little
later
another
then
a
man
and
woman
walking
closely
talking
in
low
tones
strolled
slowly
by
in
the
shadow
of
the
big
trees
the
quick
step
of
a
horse
and
the
sound
of
came
swiftly
nearer
and
nearer
passed
and
died
away
in
the
stillness
it
was
harry
answering
a
call
in
judge
strong
big
brown
house
a
nurse
in
her
uniform
of
blue
and
white
by
the
dim
light
of
a
leaned
over
her
patient
with
a
glass
of
water
in
old
town
a
young
woman
in
shabby
dress
with
a
basket
on
her
arm
hurried
trembling
and
frightened
across
the
lonely
square
under
the
quiet
stars
in
the
soft
moonlight
the
monument
stood
grim
and
cold
and
sinister

of

chapter
ix
the
edge
op
the
battlefield
but
it
was
as
if
his
superior
officers
had
ordered
him
to
mark
time
while
his
whole
soul
was
eager
for
the
command
to
charge
dan
was
trying
to
prepare
his
evening
sermon
for
the
third
sunday
of
what
the
old
doctor
called
his
corinthian
ministry
the
afternoon
was
half
gone
when
he
arose
from
his
study
table
all
day
he
had
been
at
it
and
all
day
the
devils
of
dissatisfaction
had
rioted
in
his
soul
or
wherever
it
is
that
such
devils
are
supposed
to
riot
the
three
weeks
had
not
been
idle
weeks
for
dan
he
had
made
many
pastoral
calls
at
the
homes
of
his
congregation
he
had
attended
numberless
committee
meetings
already
he
was
beginning
to
feel
the
tug
of
his
people
need
the
world
old
need
of
sympathy
and
inspiration
of
courage
and
cheer
the
need
of
the
soldier
for
the
of
his
comrades
the
need
of
the
striving
runner
for
the
lusty
shout
of
his
friends
the
need
of
the
toiling
servant
for
the
of
his
master
keenly
sensitive
to
this
great
unvoiced
cry
of
life
the
young
man
answered
in
his
heart
here
am
i
use
me
standing
before
his
people
he
felt
as
one
who
on
the
edge
of
a
battlefield
longs
with
all
his
heart
to
throw
himself
into
the
fight
but
it
was
as
if
his
superior
officers
had
ordered
him
to
mark
time
while
his
whole
soul
was
eager
for
the
command
to
charge
why
do
people
go
to
church
what
do
men
ask
of
their
religion
what
have
they
the
right
to
expect
from
those
who
assume
to
lead
them
in
their
worship
already
these
questions
were
being
shouted
at
him
from
the
innermost
depths
of
his
consciousness
he
felt
the
answer
that
his
master
would
give
but
always
between
him
and
those
to
whom
he
would
speak
there
came
the
thought
of
his
employers
and
he
found
himself
while
speaking
to
the
people
nervously
watching
the
faces
of
the
men
by
whose
permission
he
spoke
so
it
came
that
he
was
not
satisfied
with
his
work
that
afternoon
and
he
tossed
aside
his
sermon
to
leave
his
study
for
the
fresh
air
and
sunshine
of
the
open
fields
from
his
roses
the
doctor
hailed
him
as
he
went
down
the
street
but
the
boy
only
answered
with
a
greeting
and
a
wave
of
his
hand
dan
did
not
need
the
doctor
that
day
straight
out
into
the
country
he
went
walking
fast
down
one
hill
up
another
across
a
creek
over
fences
through
a
pasture
into
the
woods
an
hour
of
this
at
a
good
hard
pace
and
he
felt
better
the
old
familiar
voices
of
hill
and
field
and
forest
and
stream
soothed
and
calmed
him
the
physical
exercise
satisfied
to
some
extent
his
instinct
and
passion
for
action
coming
back
through
old
town
and
leisurely
climbing
the
hill
on
the
road
that
leads
past
the
old
academy
he
paused
frequently
to
look
back
over
the
ever
widening
view
and
to
drink
deep
of
the
pure
air
at
the
top
of
the
hill
reluctant
to
go
back
to
the
town
that
lay
beyond
he
stood
contemplating
the
ancient
school
building
that
held
so
bravely
its
commanding
position
and
looked
so
pitiful
in
its
shabby
old
age
then
passing
through
a
gap
in
the
fence
and
crossing
the
yard
he
entered
the
building
for
a
while
he
wandered
curiously
about
the
rooms
reading
the
names
scratched
on
the
plaster
walls
cut
in
the
desks
and
seats
on
the
window
casing
and
on
the
big
square
posts
that
in
the
lower
rooms
supported
the
ceiling
he
laughed
to
himself
as
he
noticed
how
the
sides
of
these
posts
facing
away
from
the
raised
platform
at
the
end
of
the
room
were
most
elaborately
carved
it
suggested
so
vividly
the
life
that
had
once
stirred
within
the
old
walls
several
of
the
names
were
already
familiar
to
him
he
tried
to
imagine
the
venerable
heads
of
families
he
knew
as
they
were
in
the
days
when
they
sat
upon
these
worn
benches
did
judge
strong
or
elder
jordan
perhaps
throw
one
of
those
that
stuck
so
hard
and
fast
to
the
ceiling
and
did
some
of
the
grandmothers
he
had
met
giggle
and
hide
their
faces
at
nathaniel
cunning
evasion
of
the
teacher
quick
effort
to
locate
the
successful
marksman
had
those
staid
pillars
of
the
church
ever
been
swayed
and
bent
by
passions
of
young
manhood
and
womanhood
had
their
minds
ever
been
stirred
by
the
questions
and
doubts
of
youth
had
their
hearts
ever
throbbed
with
eager
longing
to
know
to
feel
life
in
its
fullness
seating
himself
at
one
of
the
battered
desks
he
tried
to
bring
back
the
days
that
were
gone
and
to
see
about
him
the
faces
of
those
who
once
had
filled
the
room
with
the
strength
and
gladness
of
their
youth
he
felt
strangely
old
in
thus
trying
to
feel
a
boy
among
those
boys
and
girls
of
the
days
long
gone
who
among
the
boys
would
be
his
own
particular
chum
elder
jordan
he
smiled
and
who
the
blood
mounted
to
his
cheek
at
the
thought
who
among
the
girls
would
be
out
of
the
mists
of
his
revery
came
a
face
a
face
that
was
strangely
often
in
his
mind
since
that
day
when
he
arrived
in
corinth
several
times
he
had
caught
passing
glimpses
of
her
once
he
had
met
her
on
the
street
and
ventured
to
bow
and
harry
with
whom
he
had
already
begun
an
enduring
friendship
had
told
him
much
to
add
to
his
interest
in
her
but
to
dream
about
the
stranger
in
this
way
what
nonsense
he
exclaimed
aloud
and
rising
strode
to
the
window
to
clear
his
mind
of
those
too
strong
fancies
by
a
sight
of
the
world
in
which
he
lived
and
to
which
he
belonged
the
next
moment
he
drew
back
with
a
start
a
young
woman
in
the
uniform
of
a
trained
nurse
was
entering
the
yard
chapter
x
a
matter
of
opinion
spoke
of
condemnation
is
that
just
the
question
are
you
not
unfair
miss
farwell
had
heard
much
of
the
new
pastor
of
the
memorial
church
harry
frequently
urged
her
to
attend
services
deborah
when
hope
had
seen
her
was
eloquent
in
his
praise
strong
and
the
ladies
who
called
at
the
house
spoke
of
him
often
but
for
the
first
two
weeks
of
her
stay
at
judge
strong
the
nurse
had
been
confined
so
closely
to
the
care
of
her
patient
that
she
had
heard
nothing
to
identify
the
preacher
with
the
big
stranger
whom
she
had
met
at
the
depot
the
day
of
her
arrival
by
the
time
miss
farwell
began
hearing
of
the
new
preacher
the
interest
occasioned
by
his
defense
of
denny
had
already
died
down
and
it
chanced
that
no
one
mentioned
it
in
her
presence
when
speaking
of
him
while
each
time
he
had
called
at
the
strong
home
the
nurse
had
been
absent
or
busy
thus
it
happened
that
so
far
as
she
knew
miss
farwell
had
never
met
the
minister
about
whom
she
had
heard
so
much
but
she
had
several
times
seen
the
big
fellow
who
had
apologized
at
such
length
for
running
into
her
at
the
depot
and
who
had
gone
so
quickly
to
the
assistance
of
denny
it
was
natural
under
such
conditions
that
she
should
remember
him
it
was
natural
too
that
she
never
dreamed
of
connecting
the
young
hero
of
the
street
fight
with
the
reverend
matthews
of
the
memorial
church
her
patient
had
so
far
improved
that
the
nurse
was
now
able
to
leave
her
for
an
hour
or
two
in
the
afternoon
and
the
young
woman
had
gone
for
a
walk
just
beyond
the
outskirts
of
the
village
coming
to
the
top
of
the
hill
she
had
turned
aside
from
the
dusty
highway
thinking
to
enjoy
the
view
from
the
shade
of
a
great
oak
that
grew
on
a
grassy
knoll
in
the
center
of
the
school
grounds
dan
watched
her
as
she
made
her
way
slowly
across
the
yard
his
eyes
bright
with
admiration
for
her
womanly
grace
as
she
stopped
here
and
there
to
pick
a
wild
flower
from
the
tangle
of
grass
and
weeds
reaching
the
tree
she
seated
herself
and
laying
her
parasol
on
the
grass
by
her
side
began
arranging
the
blossoms
she
had
gathered
pausing
now
and
then
to
look
over
the
rolling
country
of
field
and
woods
that
dotted
by
farm
houses
with
their
buildings
and
stacks
stretched
away
into
the
blue
distance
the
young
fellow
at
the
window
gazed
at
her
with
almost
superstitious
awe
that
her
face
had
come
before
him
so
vividly
as
he
sat
dreaming
in
the
old
at
the
very
moment
when
she
was
turning
into
the
yard
moved
him
greatly
his
blood
tingled
at
the
odd
premonition
that
this
woman
was
somehow
to
play
a
great
part
in
his
life
nothing
seemed
more
natural
than
that
he
should
have
come
to
this
spot
this
afternoon
neither
was
it
at
all
strange
that
in
her
walk
she
too
should
be
attracted
by
the
beauty
of
the
place
but
the
feeling
forced
itself
upon
him
nevertheless
that
this
perfectly
natural
incident
was
a
great
event
in
his
life
he
knew
that
he
would
go
to
her
presently
he
was
painfully
aware
that
he
ought
not
to
be
thus
secretly
watching
her
but
he
hesitated
as
one
about
to
take
a
step
that
could
never
be
retraced
she
started
when
he
appeared
in
the
doorway
of
the
building
and
from
her
place
then
recognizing
him
she
dropped
back
on
the
grass
and
there
was
a
frown
on
her
face
though
her
cheeks
were
red
she
was
indignant
with
herself
that
she
should
be
blushing
like
a
schoolgirl
at
the
presence
of
this
stranger
whose
name
even
she
did
not
know
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
farwell
i
fear
that
i
startled
you
he
said
hat
in
hand
already
dan
had
grown
so
accustomed
to
being
greeted
by
strangers
that
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
this
lady
did
not
know
who
he
was
she
saw
the
sunlight
on
his
shaggy
hair
and
the
fine
poise
of
the
head
as
she
answered
shortly
you
did
she
was
making
him
feel
her
anger
at
herself
and
also
when
she
saw
his
embarrassment
at
her
blunt
words
and
manner
she
smiled
i
am
sorry
he
said
but
he
did
not
offer
to
go
on
his
way
when
she
made
no
reply
but
began
rearranging
her
handful
of
blossoms
he
spoke
again
remarking
on
the
beauty
of
the
view
before
them
and
ventured
to
ask
if
the
knoll
was
to
her
a
favorite
spot
adding
that
it
was
his
first
visit
to
the
place
i
have
never
been
here
before
either
she
answered
the
brief
silence
that
followed
was
broken
by
dan
we
seem
to
have
made
a
discovery
he
said
wondering
why
she
should
seem
confused
at
his
simple
remark
i
know
i
ought
to
go
he
continued
i
will
if
you
say
the
word
but
he
paused
you
were
here
first
she
returned
with
a
smile
really
she
thought
there
was
no
reason
why
she
should
drive
him
away
he
was
so
evidently
a
gentleman
and
the
place
was
on
the
public
thoroughfare
then
i
may
stay
he
dropped
on
the
grass
at
her
feet
with
an
exclamation
of
satisfaction
and
pleasure
looking
away
over
the
landscape
where
the
clouds
and
shadows
were
racing
and
the
warm
autumn
light
lay
on
the
varying
shades
of
green
and
brown
he
remarked
do
you
know
when
i
see
a
bit
of
like
that
on
such
a
day
as
this
or
when
i
am
out
in
the
woods
or
up
in
the
hills
i
wonder
what
men
build
churches
for
anyway
i
fear
i
must
be
something
of
a
pagan
for
i
often
feel
that
i
can
worship
god
best
in
his
own
temple
quite
heathenish
is
it
he
laughed
but
under
the
laugh
there
was
a
note
of
troubled
seriousness
she
looked
at
him
curiously
and
is
it
heathenish
to
worship
god
outside
of
a
church
if
it
is
i
fear
that
i
too
am
a
heathen
he
noted
the
words
i
too
and
saw
instantly
that
she
did
not
know
him
but
had
understood
from
his
words
that
he
was
not
a
church
man
he
felt
that
he
ought
to
correct
her
false
impression
that
he
ought
to
tell
her
who
and
what
he
was
but
he
was
possessed
of
a
curious
feeling
of
reluctance
to
declare
his
calling
the
truth
is
dan
matthews
did
not
want
to
meet
this
woman
as
a
priest
but
as
a
man
he
had
already
learned
how
the
moment
the
preacher
was
announced
the
man
was
pushed
into
the
background
while
he
hesitated
she
watched
him
with
increasing
interest
his
words
had
pleased
her
she
waited
for
him
to
speak
again
i
suppose
your
profession
does
keep
you
from
anything
like
regular
church
attendance
he
said
yes
she
answered
i
have
found
that
sick
people
do
not
as
a
rule
observe
a
religion
but
it
is
not
my
professional
duties
that
keep
me
from
church
you
are
not
then
decidedly
i
am
not
she
answered
really
you
surprise
me
i
thought
of
course
you
were
a
member
of
some
church
there
was
a
touch
of
impatience
in
her
quick
reply
you
thought
course
and
why
of
course
please
he
started
to
answer
but
she
went
on
quickly
i
know
why
because
i
am
a
woman
weaker
it
is
not
possible
to
describe
the
fine
touch
in
her
voice
when
she
said
the
weaker
sex
it
was
so
delicately
done
that
it
had
none
of
the
coarseness
that
commonly
marks
like
expressions
when
used
by
some
women
dan
was
surprised
to
feel
that
it
emphasized
the
fineness
of
her
character
as
well
as
its
strength
because
i
am
not
a
man
must
i
be
she
continued
is
a
woman
life
of
so
little
influence
in
the
world
that
she
can
spend
it
in
as
little
girls
play
at
being
grown
up
have
i
not
as
great
a
right
to
my
paganism
as
you
call
it
as
you
have
to
yours
again
he
saw
his
opportunity
and
realized
that
he
ought
to
correct
her
mistake
in
assuming
from
his
words
that
he
was
not
a
man
of
church
affiliation
but
again
he
passed
it
by
saying
slowly
instead
i
think
your
kind
of
paganism
must
be
a
very
splendid
thing
no
one
could
think
of
one
in
that
dress
as
useless
i
did
not
mean
i
understand
i
think
he
said
earnestly
but
wo
you
tell
me
why
you
feel
so
about
the
church
she
laughed
as
she
returned
one
might
think
from
your
awful
seriousness
that
you
were
a
preacher
father
confessor
if
you
please
she
began
mockingly
then
stopped
arrested
by
the
expression
of
his
face
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
have
i
been
rude
with
a
forced
laugh
he
answered
oh
no
indeed
not
at
all
it
is
only
that
your
views
of
the
christian
religion
surprise
me
my
views
of
the
christian
religion
she
repeated
very
serious
now
i
did
not
know
that
my
views
of
christianity
were
mentioned
he
was
bewildered
but
the
church
you
were
speaking
of
the
church
and
the
church
and
christianity
are
one
and
the
same
of
course
again
with
a
touch
of
sarcasm
more
pronounced
you
will
tell
me
next
i
suppose
that
a
minister
really
ministers
dan
was
astonished
and
hurt
he
had
learned
much
of
the
spirit
of
christianity
in
his
backwoods
home
but
he
knew
nothing
of
churches
except
that
which
the
school
had
taught
him
he
had
accepted
the
church
to
which
he
belonged
at
its
own
valuation
highly
colored
by
biased
historians
such
words
as
these
were
to
his
ears
little
less
than
sacrilege
he
was
shocked
that
they
should
come
from
one
whose
personality
and
evident
character
had
impressed
him
so
strongly
his
voice
was
doubtful
and
perplexed
as
he
said
but
is
not
that
true
church
of
christ
which
is
composed
of
his
true
disciples
christian
surely
they
can
no
more
be
separated
than
the
sun
can
be
separated
from
the
sunshine
and
is
not
the
ministry
a
vital
part
of
that
church
miss
farwell
seeing
him
so
troubled
wondered
whether
she
understood
him
she
felt
that
she
was
talking
too
freely
to
this
stranger
but
his
questions
drew
her
on
and
she
was
curiously
anxious
that
he
should
understand
her
i
was
not
thinking
of
that
true
church
composed
of
the
true
disciples
of
christ
she
returned
and
that
is
just
it
do
you
see
true
church
that
is
so
inseparable
from
the
religion
of
christ
is
so
far
forgotten
that
it
never
enters
into
any
thought
of
the
church
at
the
sun
always
shines
it
is
true
but
we
do
not
always
have
the
sunshine
there
are
the
dark
and
stormy
days
you
know
and
sometimes
there
is
an
eclipse
to
me
these
are
the
dark
days
so
dark
that
i
wonder
sometimes
if
it
is
not
an
eclipse
she
paused
then
added
deliberately
this
selfish
wasteful
cruel
heartless
thing
that
men
have
built
up
around
their
opinions
and
whims
and
ambitions
has
so
come
between
the
people
and
the
christianity
of
the
christ
that
they
are
beginning
to
question
if
indeed
there
is
anywhere
such
a
thing
as
the
true
church
again
dan
was
startled
at
her
words
and
by
her
passionate
earnestness
the
more
so
that
in
the
manner
of
her
speaking
as
in
her
words
there
was
an
impersonal
touch
very
unusual
to
those
who
speak
on
religious
topics
and
there
was
a
note
of
sadness
in
her
voice
as
well
it
was
as
if
she
spoke
to
him
professionally
of
the
sickness
of
some
one
dear
to
her
and
sought
to
keep
her
love
for
her
patient
from
influencing
her
calm
consideration
of
the
case
his
next
words
were
forced
from
him
almost
against
his
will
and
his
eyes
had
that
wide
questioning
look
so
like
that
of
his
mother
and
the
ministry
he
said
she
answered
you
ask
if
the
ministry
is
not
a
vital
part
of
the
church
and
your
very
question
expresses
conditions
clearly
what
conception
of
christianity
is
it
that
makes
it
possible
for
us
to
even
think
of
the
ministry
as
a
part
of
the
church
why
the
true
church
is
a
ministry
there
can
be
no
other
reason
for
its
existence
but
do
you
see
how
we
have
come
to
think
of
the
ministry
as
we
have
come
to
think
of
the
church
it
is
to
us
as
you
say
a
part
of
this
great
organization
that
men
have
created
and
control
and
in
this
we
are
right
for
this
church
has
made
the
minister
and
this
minister
has
in
turn
made
the
church
they
are
indeed
inseparable
dan
caught
up
a
flower
that
she
had
dropped
and
began
picking
it
to
pieces
with
trembling
fingers
to
me
he
said
slowly
the
minister
is
a
servant
of
god
i
believe
of
course
that
whatever
work
a
man
does
in
life
he
must
do
as
his
service
to
the
race
and
in
that
sense
he
serves
god
but
the
ministry
he
reached
for
another
flower
choosing
his
words
carefully
the
ministry
is
to
me
the
highest
service
to
which
a
man
may
be
called
she
did
not
reply
but
looked
away
over
the
valley
tell
me
he
said
is
it
not
so
if
you
believe
it
then
to
you
it
is
so
she
answered
but
you
he
urged
how
do
you
look
upon
the
minister
why
should
i
tell
you
what
difference
does
it
make
what
i
think
you
forget
that
we
are
strangers
she
smiled
let
us
talk
about
the
weather
that
a
safe
topic
i
forgotten
that
we
are
strangers
he
said
with
an
answering
smile
but
i
am
interested
in
what
you
have
said
because
you
you
have
evidently
thought
much
upon
the
matter
and
your
profession
must
certainly
give
you
opportunities
for
observation
tell
me
how
do
you
look
upon
the
minister
and
his
work
she
studied
him
intently
before
she
answered
then
as
if
satisfied
with
what
she
found
in
his
face
she
said
calmly
to
me
he
is
the
most
useless
creature
in
all
the
world
he
is
a
man
set
apart
from
all
those
who
live
lives
of
service
who
do
the
work
of
the
world
and
then
that
he
should
be
distinguished
from
these
these
servers
by
this
noblest
of
all
titles
is
the
bitterest
irony
that
the
mind
of
the
race
ever
conceived
her
companion
face
was
white
now
as
he
answered
quickly
but
surely
a
minister
of
the
gospel
is
doing
god
will
and
is
therefore
serving
god
she
answered
as
quickly
man
serves
god
only
by
serving
men
there
can
be
no
ministry
but
the
ministry
of
man
to
man
but
the
minister
is
a
man
the
world
can
not
accept
him
as
such
because
his
individuality
is
lost
in
the
church
to
which
he
belongs
other
institutions
employ
a
time
the
church
employs
his
life
he
has
no
existence
outside
his
profession
there
is
no
outside
the
church
for
him
the
world
can
not
know
him
as
a
man
for
he
is
all
preacher
but
the
church
employs
him
to
minister
to
the
world
i
can
not
see
that
it
does
so
at
all
on
the
contrary
a
church
employs
a
pastor
to
serve
itself
to
the
churches
christianity
has
become
a
question
of
fidelity
to
a
church
and
creed
and
not
to
the
spirit
of
christ
the
minister
standing
and
success
in
his
calling
the
amount
of
his
salary
even
depends
upon
his
devotion
to
the
particular
views
of
the
church
that
calls
him
and
his
ability
to
please
those
who
pay
him
for
pleasing
them
his
service
to
the
world
does
not
enter
into
the
transaction
any
more
than
when
you
buy
the
latest
novel
of
your
favorite
author
or
purchase
a
picture
that
pleases
you
or
buy
a
ticket
to
hear
your
favorite
musician
we
do
not
pretend
when
we
do
these
things
that
we
are
ministering
to
the
world
or
that
we
are
moved
to
spend
our
money
thus
to
serve
god
even
though
there
may
be
in
the
book
the
picture
or
the
music
many
things
that
will
make
the
world
better
the
big
fellow
moved
uneasily
but
he
urged
eagerly
the
church
is
a
sacred
institution
it
is
not
to
be
compared
to
the
institutions
of
men
its
very
purpose
is
so
holy
so
different
from
other
organizations
which
of
the
hundreds
of
different
sects
with
their
different
creeds
do
you
mean
by
the
church
she
asked
quickly
or
do
you
mean
all
and
if
all
are
equally
sacred
with
the
same
holy
purpose
why
are
they
at
such
variance
with
each
other
and
why
is
there
such
useless
competition
between
them
how
are
these
institutions
organized
and
controlled
as
they
are
by
men
different
from
other
institutions
organized
and
controlled
by
the
same
men
surely
you
are
aware
that
there
are
thousands
of
institutions
and
organizations
in
the
world
with
aims
as
distinctly
christian
as
the
professed
object
of
the
church
why
are
these
not
as
holy
and
sacred
but
the
church
is
of
divine
origin
so
is
this
tree
so
is
the
material
in
that
old
building
so
are
those
farms
yonder
to
me
it
is
only
the
spirit
of
god
in
a
thing
that
can
make
it
holy
or
sacred
surely
there
is
as
much
of
god
manifest
in
a
field
of
grain
as
in
any
of
these
churches
why
then
is
not
a
corn
field
a
holy
institution
and
why
not
the
farmer
who
tends
the
field
a
minister
of
god
you
would
condemn
then
everyone
in
the
church
he
asked
bitterly
i
can
not
think
that
i
know
he
paused
condemn
she
answered
questioningly
i
condemn
those
deep
gray
eyes
were
turned
full
upon
him
and
he
saw
her
face
grow
tender
and
sad
while
the
sweet
voice
trembled
with
emotion
who
spoke
of
condemnation
is
that
just
the
question
are
you
not
unfair
in
my
she
spoke
the
words
solemnly
my
ministry
i
have
stood
at
the
bedside
of
too
many
heroes
and
heroines
not
to
know
that
the
church
is
filled
with
the
truest
and
bravest
and
that
oh
do
you
see
that
is
the
awful
pity
of
it
all
that
those
true
brave
noble
lives
should
be
the
the
cloud
that
hides
the
sun
as
for
the
ministry
one
in
my
profession
could
scarcely
help
knowing
the
grand
lives
that
are
hidden
in
this
useless
class
set
apart
by
the
church
to
push
its
interests
the
ministers
are
useless
only
because
they
are
not
free
they
can
not
help
themselves
they
are
slaves
not
servants
their
first
duty
is
not
service
to
the
world
that
so
much
needs
their
ministry
but
obedience
to
the
whims
of
this
hideous
monster
that
they
have
created
and
now
must
obey
or
she
paused
or
what
he
said
she
continued
as
if
she
had
not
heard
they
are
valued
for
their
fidelity
to
other
men
standards
never
for
the
worth
of
their
own
lives
they
are
hired
to
give
always
the
opinions
of
others
and
they
are
denied
the
only
thing
that
can
make
any
life
of
worth
freedom
of
the
surest
road
to
failure
for
them
is
to
hold
or
express
opinions
of
their
own
they
are
held
not
as
necessities
but
as
a
luxury
like
heaven
itself
for
which
if
men
have
the
means
to
spare
they
pay
they
can
have
no
real
fellowship
with
the
servants
of
the
race
for
they
are
set
apart
by
the
church
not
to
a
ministry
but
from
it
their
very
personal
influence
is
less
than
the
influence
of
other
good
men
because
the
world
accepts
it
as
professional
it
is
the
way
they
earn
their
living
but
do
you
think
that
the
ministers
themselves
wish
to
be
so
set
apart
asked
dan
i
i
am
sure
they
must
all
crave
that
fellowship
with
the
workers
i
think
that
is
true
she
answered
i
am
sure
it
is
of
the
many
grand
good
men
in
the
ministry
whom
i
have
known
oh
he
said
quickly
then
there
are
good
men
in
the
ministry
yes
she
retorted
just
as
there
are
gold
and
precious
stones
ornamenting
heathen
gods
and
pagan
temples
and
their
goodness
is
as
useless
for
whether
they
wish
it
or
not
the
facts
remain
that
their
masters
set
them
apart
and
that
they
are
separated
and
i
notice
that
most
of
them
accept
gracefully
the
special
privileges
and
wear
the
title
and
all
the
marks
of
their
calling
that
emphasize
the
distinction
between
them
and
their
fellow
men
yet
you
wear
a
distinguishing
dress
he
said
i
knew
your
calling
the
first
time
i
saw
you
she
laughed
merrily
well
what
amuses
you
he
demanded
smiling
himself
at
her
merriment
oh
it
so
funny
to
see
such
a
big
man
so
helpless
really
could
you
find
an
argument
of
more
weight
besides
you
did
know
my
profession
the
first
time
you
saw
me
i
only
wear
these
clothes
when
i
am
at
work
just
as
a
mechanic
wears
his
overalls
and
they
are
just
as
necessary
as
you
know
the
first
time
you
you
bumped
into
me
i
dressed
like
other
people
and
i
had
paid
full
fare
too
nurses
do
get
clergy
credentials
from
the
railroad
with
this
she
sprang
to
her
feet
look
how
long
the
shadows
are
i
must
go
right
back
to
my
patient
this
minute
as
she
spoke
she
was
all
at
once
painfully
conscious
again
that
this
man
was
a
stranger
what
must
he
think
of
her
how
could
she
explain
that
it
was
not
her
habit
to
talk
thus
freely
to
men
whom
she
did
not
know
she
wished
that
he
would
tell
her
his
name
at
least
slowly
silently
they
walked
together
across
the
yard
as
they
passed
through
the
gap
in
the
fence
dan
turned
to
look
back
it
seemed
to
him
ages
since
he
had
entered
the
yard
what
the
matter
have
you
lost
something
she
asked
no
that
is
i
perhaps
i
have
but
never
mind
it
is
of
no
great
importance
and
anyway
i
could
not
find
it
i
think
i
will
say
now
he
added
i
not
going
to
town
just
yet
again
she
wondered
at
his
face
it
was
so
troubled
he
watched
her
down
the
street
until
her
blue
dress
with
its
white
trimming
became
a
blur
in
the
shadows
then
he
struck
out
once
more
for
the
open
country
chapter
xi
reflections
and
gradually
out
of
the
material
of
his
school
experience
he
built
again
the
old
bulwark
behind
which
he
could
laugh
at
his
confusion
of
the
hour
before
since
that
first
chance
meeting
at
the
depot
when
he
had
looked
into
the
nurse
eyes
and
heard
her
voice
only
for
a
moment
dan
had
not
been
able
to
put
the
young
woman
wholly
out
of
his
mind
the
incident
on
the
street
when
she
had
gone
to
denny
and
the
scene
that
followed
in
home
had
strengthened
the
first
impression
while
the
meeting
at
the
old
academy
yard
had
stirred
depths
in
his
nature
never
touched
before
the
very
things
she
had
said
to
him
were
so
evidently
born
out
of
a
nature
great
in
its
passion
for
truth
and
in
its
capacity
for
feeling
that
even
though
her
words
were
biting
and
stung
he
could
not
but
rejoice
in
the
beauty
and
strength
of
the
spirit
they
revealed
the
usual
trite
criticisms
of
the
church
dan
had
heard
and
had
already
learned
to
think
somewhat
lightly
of
the
kind
of
people
who
commonly
make
them
but
this
young
woman
so
wholesome
so
good
to
look
at
in
her
sweet
seriousness
so
strong
in
her
womanliness
and
withal
so
useful
in
what
she
called
her
ministry
this
woman
was
well
she
was
different
her
words
were
all
the
more
potent
coming
as
they
did
after
the
disquieting
thoughts
and
the
feeling
of
dissatisfaction
that
had
driven
him
from
his
study
that
afternoon
the
young
minister
could
not
at
first
rid
himself
of
the
hateful
suggestion
that
there
might
be
much
truth
in
the
things
she
had
said
after
all
under
the
fine
words
the
platitudes
and
the
professions
the
fact
remained
he
earning
his
daily
bread
by
being
obedient
to
those
who
hired
him
he
had
already
begun
to
feel
that
his
work
was
not
so
much
to
give
what
he
could
to
meet
the
need
as
to
do
what
he
could
to
supply
the
wants
of
memorial
church
and
that
his
very
chance
to
serve
depended
upon
his
satisfying
these
judges
he
saw
too
that
these
same
judges
his
masters
felt
the
dignity
of
their
position
heavily
upon
them
and
would
not
be
in
the
least
backward
about
rendering
their
decision
they
would
let
him
know
what
things
pleased
them
and
what
things
were
not
to
their
liking
their
opinions
and
commandments
would
not
always
be
in
definite
words
perhaps
but
they
would
be
none
the
less
clearly
and
forcibly
given
for
all
that
he
had
spoken
truly
when
he
had
told
miss
farwell
as
they
parted
that
he
had
lost
something
and
now
as
he
walked
the
country
road
he
sought
earnestly
to
regain
it
to
find
again
his
certainty
of
mind
to
steady
his
shaken
confidence
in
the
work
to
which
he
had
given
his
life
dan
character
was
too
strong
his
conviction
too
powerful
his
purpose
too
genuine
for
him
to
be
easily
turned
from
any
determined
line
of
thought
or
action
certainly
it
would
require
more
than
the
words
of
a
stranger
to
swing
him
far
from
his
course
even
though
he
felt
that
there
might
be
a
degree
of
truth
in
them
and
so
as
he
walked
his
mind
began
shaping
answers
to
the
nurse
criticism
and
gradually
out
of
the
material
of
his
school
experience
he
built
again
the
old
bulwark
behind
which
he
could
laugh
at
his
confusion
of
the
hour
before
but
withal
dan
admiration
of
the
young
woman
mind
and
character
was
not
lessened
more
he
felt
that
she
had
in
some
way
given
him
a
deeper
view
into
her
life
and
thoughts
than
was
due
a
mere
stranger
he
was
conscious
too
of
a
sense
of
shame
that
he
had
in
a
way
accepted
her
confidence
under
false
pretense
he
had
let
her
believe
he
was
not
what
he
was
but
he
argued
with
himself
he
had
not
intentionally
deceived
her
and
he
smiled
at
last
to
think
how
she
would
enjoy
the
situation
with
him
when
she
learned
the
truth
how
different
she
was
from
any
of
the
women
he
had
known
in
the
church
they
mostly
accepted
their
religious
views
as
they
would
take
the
doctor
prescription
without
question
and
how
like
she
was
to
his
mother
then
came
the
inevitable
thought
what
a
triumph
it
would
be
if
he
could
win
such
a
character
to
the
church
what
an
opportunity
could
he
do
it
he
must
with
that
the
minister
began
putting
his
thoughts
in
shape
for
a
sermon
on
the
ministry
determined
to
make
it
the
effort
of
his
life
he
planned
how
he
would
announce
it
next
sunday
for
the
following
week
and
how
with
harry
assistance
he
would
perhaps
secure
her
attendance
at
the
service
meanwhile
hope
farwell
passing
quickly
along
the
village
street
on
her
way
home
from
the
old
academy
yard
was
beset
by
many
varied
and
conflicting
emotions
recalling
her
conversation
with
the
man
who
was
to
her
so
nearly
a
total
stranger
she
felt
that
she
had
been
too
earnest
too
frank
it
troubled
her
to
think
how
she
had
laid
bare
her
deepest
feelings
she
could
not
understand
how
she
had
so
far
forgotten
her
habitual
reserve
there
was
a
something
in
that
young
man
so
tall
and
strong
and
withal
so
clean
looking
that
had
called
from
her
in
spite
of
herself
this
exposition
of
her
innermost
life
and
thoughts
she
ought
not
to
have
yielded
so
easily
to
the
subtle
demand
that
he
unconsciously
no
doubt
had
made
it
was
as
though
she
had
flung
wide
open
the
door
to
that
sacred
inner
chamber
at
which
only
the
most
intimate
of
her
friends
were
privileged
to
knock
he
had
come
into
the
field
of
her
life
in
the
most
commonplace
manner
through
the
natural
incident
of
their
meeting
he
should
have
stopped
there
or
should
have
been
halted
by
her
the
hour
should
have
been
spent
in
conversation
on
such
trivial
and
commonplace
topics
as
usually
occupy
strangers
upon
such
occasions
and
they
should
have
parted
strangers
still
she
felt
that
after
this
exhibition
of
herself
as
she
termed
it
in
her
mind
she
at
least
was
no
stranger
to
him
and
she
was
angry
with
herself
and
ashamed
when
she
reflected
how
deeply
into
her
life
he
had
entered
angry
with
him
too
in
a
way
that
he
had
gained
this
admittance
with
apparently
no
effort
she
reflected
too
that
while
she
had
so
freely
opened
the
door
to
him
and
had
admitted
him
with
a
confidence
wholly
inexcusable
he
had
in
no
way
returned
that
confidence
she
searched
her
memory
for
some
word
some
expression
of
his
that
would
even
hint
at
what
he
thought
or
believed
or
was
within
himself
something
that
would
justify
her
in
feeling
that
she
knew
him
even
a
little
but
there
was
nothing
it
was
as
though
this
stranger
whom
she
had
admitted
into
the
privacy
of
the
inner
chamber
had
worn
mask
and
gown
no
expression
had
escaped
him
he
had
not
even
told
her
his
name
while
she
had
laid
out
for
his
inspection
the
strongest
passions
of
her
life
had
felt
herself
urged
to
show
him
all
and
had
kept
nothing
hidden
he
had
looked
and
had
gone
away
making
no
comment
of
course
she
thought
he
is
a
gentleman
and
he
is
cultured
and
refined
and
a
good
man
too
of
this
she
was
sure
but
that
was
nothing
one
does
not
talk
as
she
had
talked
to
a
man
just
because
he
is
not
a
ruffian
or
a
boor
she
wanted
to
know
him
as
she
had
made
herself
known
to
him
she
could
not
say
why
the
nurse
work
in
corinth
was
nearly
finished
she
would
probably
never
meet
this
man
again
she
started
at
the
thought
would
she
ever
meet
him
again
what
did
it
matter
and
yet
she
would
not
confess
it
even
to
herself
but
it
did
somehow
seem
to
matter
of
one
thing
she
was
sure
he
was
well
worth
knowing
she
had
felt
that
there
was
a
depth
a
richness
a
genuineness
to
him
and
it
was
this
feeling
this
certainty
of
him
that
had
led
her
to
such
openness
yes
she
was
sure
there
were
treasures
there
deep
within
for
those
whom
he
chose
to
admit
she
wished
why
should
she
not
confess
it
after
all
she
wished
that
she
might
be
admitted
hope
farwell
was
alone
in
the
world
with
no
near
living
relatives
she
had
only
her
friends
and
friends
to
her
meant
more
than
to
those
who
have
others
dearer
to
them
by
ties
of
blood
that
evening
when
harry
was
leaving
the
house
after
his
visit
to
his
patient
the
nurse
went
with
him
to
the
door
as
usual
for
any
word
of
instruction
he
might
wish
to
give
her
privately
well
miss
hope
he
said
you
done
it
what
have
i
done
she
asked
startled
saved
my
patient
in
there
she
would
have
gone
without
a
doubt
if
you
had
not
come
when
you
did
it
your
case
all
right
then
i
glad
i
came
she
said
quietly
and
i
may
go
back
soon
now
may
i
not
doctor
he
hesitated
slowly
drawing
on
his
gloves
must
you
go
back
miss
farwell
i
we
need
you
so
much
here
in
corinth
there
are
so
many
cases
you
know
where
all
depends
upon
the
nurse
there
is
not
a
trained
nurse
this
side
of
louis
i
am
sure
i
could
keep
you
busy
there
was
something
more
than
professional
interest
in
the
keen
eyes
that
looked
so
intently
into
her
own
thank
you
doctor
you
are
very
kind
but
you
know
dr
miles
expects
me
he
warned
me
the
last
thing
before
i
left
that
he
was
only
lending
me
to
you
for
this
particular
case
you
know
how
he
says
those
things
yes
said
the
man
grimly
i
know
miles
it
is
one
of
the
secrets
of
his
success
that
he
will
be
satisfied
with
nothing
but
the
best
he
warned
me
too
he
watched
her
keenly
it
would
be
just
like
miles
he
thought
to
tell
the
young
woman
of
the
particular
nature
of
the
warning
but
miss
farwell
betrayed
no
embarrassing
knowledge
and
the
doctor
said
you
did
not
promise
to
return
to
chicago
did
you
she
answered
slowly
no
but
he
expects
me
and
i
had
no
thought
of
staying
only
for
this
case
well
wo
you
think
of
it
seriously
there
are
many
nurses
in
chicago
i
do
mean
many
like
you
interrupting
himself
hastily
but
here
there
is
no
one
at
all
and
in
his
words
there
was
a
note
of
interest
more
than
professional
she
lifted
her
face
frankly
and
let
him
look
deep
into
her
eyes
as
she
answered
i
appreciate
your
argument
abbott
and
i
will
think
about
it
he
turned
his
eyes
away
and
his
tone
was
quite
professional
as
he
said
heartily
thank
you
miss
farwell
i
shall
not
give
up
hoping
that
we
may
keep
you
good
night
is
he
a
dear
good
man
exclaimed
the
invalid
as
the
nurse
the
sick
room
yes
she
answered
he
is
a
good
man
one
of
the
best
i
think
that
i
have
ever
known
the
patient
continued
eagerly
he
told
me
the
ladies
could
come
here
for
their
aid
society
meeting
next
week
if
you
would
stay
to
take
care
of
me
you
will
wo
you
dear
the
nurse
busy
with
the
medicine
the
doctor
had
left
did
not
answer
at
once
i
would
like
it
so
much
came
the
voice
from
the
bed
hope
turned
and
went
quickly
to
her
patient
saying
with
a
smile
of
course
i
will
stay
if
you
wish
it
i
believe
the
meeting
will
do
you
good
oh
thank
you
and
you
get
to
meet
our
new
minister
then
sure
just
to
think
you
have
never
seen
him
and
he
has
called
several
times
but
you
have
always
happened
to
be
out
or
in
your
room
yes
said
the
young
woman
i
have
managed
to
miss
him
every
time
something
in
the
voice
always
so
kind
and
gentle
caused
the
sick
woman
to
turn
her
head
on
the
pillow
and
look
at
her
nurse
intently
and
you
have
been
to
church
since
you
have
been
here
either
oh
but
you
know
i
am
like
your
good
doctor
in
that
i
can
plead
professional

is
always
there
when
he
can
possibly
go
i
never
thought
of
it
before
will
you
mind
dearie
if
i
ask
you
whether
you
are
a
christian
or
not
i
told
sapphira
this
afternoon
that
i
knew
you
were
yes
said
hope
you
are
right
i
can
not
often
go
to
church
but
and
there
was
a
ring
of
seriousness
in
her
voice
now
i
am
a
christian
if
trying
to
follow
faithfully
the
teachings
of
the
christ
is
christianity
i
was
sure
you
were
murmured
the
other
brother
matthews
will
be
so
glad
to
meet
you
i
know
you
will
like
him
to
which
the
nurse
answered
but
you
will
be
in
no
condition
for
the
visit
of
the
ladies
if
i
do
take
better
care
of
you
now
did
you
know
that
you
were
going
to
sleep
well
you
are
you
have
had
a
busy
day
and
you
are
not
to
speak
another
word
except
night
i
am
going
to
turn
the
light
real
low
so
and
now
i
am
going
to
sit
here
and
tell
you
about
my
walk
you
just
to
shut
your
eyes
and
listen
and
rest
rest
rest
and
the
low
sweet
voice
told
of
the
flowers
and
the
grass
and
the
trees
the
fields
lying
warm
in
the
sunlight
with
the
flitting
and
the
hills
stretching
away
into
the
blue
until
no
troubled
thought
was
left
in
the
mind
of
the
sick
woman
like
a
child
she
slept
but
as
the
nurse
talked
to
make
her
patient
forget
the
incident
of
the
afternoon
came
back
and
while
the
sick
woman
slept
hope
farwell
sat
going
over
again
in
her
mind
the
conversation
on
the
grassy
knoll
in
the
old
academy
yard
recalling
every
word
every
look
every
expression
what
was
his
work
in
life
he
was
no
idler
she
was
sure
he
had
the
air
of
a
true
worker
of
one
who
was
spending
his
life
to
some
purpose
she
wondered
again
at
the
expression
on
his
face
as
she
had
seen
it
when
they
parted
should
she
go
back
to
the
great
city
and
lose
herself
in
her
work
or
she
smiled
to
herself
should
she
yield
to
argument
and
stay
in
corinth
a
little
longer
chapter
xii
the
nurse
forgets
he
seemed
so
made
for
fine
and
strong
things
the
affairs
of
memorial
church
were
booming
or
in
the
more
orthodox
language
of
elder
jordan
in
an
article
to
the
official
paper
of
the
denomination
the
congregation
had
taken
on
new
life
and
the
lord
work
was
being
pushed
with
a
zeal
and
determination
never
before
equalled
the
audiences
were
steadily
increasing
the
interest
was
reviving
in
every
department
and
the
world
would
soon
see
grand
old
memorial
church
taking
first
place
in
corinth
if
not
in
the
state
already
reverend
matthews
had
been
asked
to
deliver
a
special
sermon
to
the
of
j
b
who
would
attend
the
service
in
a
body
wearing
the
full
regalia
of
the
order
surely
god
had
abundantly
blessed
the
brethren
in
sending
them
such
an
able
preacher
the
week
following
dan
talk
with
miss
farwell
in
the
old
academy
yard
the
ladies
of
the
aid
society
assembled
early
and
in
unusual
numbers
for
their
meeting
at
the
home
of
judge
strong
as
the
announcement
from
the
pulpit
had
it
there
was
business
of
great
importance
to
transact
also
there
was
work
on
hand
that
must
be
finished
the
business
of
importance
was
the
planning
of
a
great
entertainment
to
be
given
in
the
opera
house
by
local
talent
both
in
and
out
of
the
church
for
the
purpose
of
raising
money
that
the
church
still
owed
their
former
pastor
the
unfinished
work
was
a
quilt
of
a
complicated
wheel
pattern
every
spoke
of
each
wheel
contained
the
name
of
some
individual
who
had
paid
ten
cents
for
the
honor
the
hubs
cost
cents
when
finished
this
beautiful
work
of
the
lord
they
said
their
work
was
the
lord
work
was
to
be
sold
to
the
highest
bidder
thereby
netting
a
sum
of
money
for
the
pulpit
furniture
fund
nearly
equal
to
the
cost
to
anyone
of
the
leading
workers
for
the
society
entertainment
in
a
single
afternoon
or
evening
for
what
would
appear
in
the
sunday
issue
of
the
daily
corinthian
as
a
social
event
it
must
not
be
understood
that
all
the
women
enrolled
as
members
of
congregation
belonged
to
the
ladies
aid
only
the
workers
were
active
in
that
important
part
of
the
body
of
christ
many
there
were
in
the
congregation
quiet
deeply
truly
religious
souls
who
had
not
the
time
for
this
service
but
in
the
scheme
of
things
as
they
are
those
were
not
classed
as
active
members
they
were
not
of
the
inner
circle
on
the
inside
they
were
reckoned
as
counting
only
on
the
roll
of
membership
but
it
was
the
strength
the
soul
the
ruling
power
the
spirit
of
this
temple
of
god
that
assembled
that
afternoon
at
judge
strong
big
brown
house
on
strong
avenue
just
beyond
strong
memorial
church
the
ally
came
also
the
ally
it
is
said
never
misses
a
ladies
aid
meeting
in
corinth
miss
farwell
was
there
with
her
patient
as
she
had
promised
and
strong
took
particular
care
that
as
fast
as
they
arrived
each
one
of
her
guests
met
the
young
woman
to
some
women
of
the
middle
class
the
trained
nurse
in
her
blue
dress
with
white
cap
and
apron
was
an
object
of
unusual
interest
they
did
not
know
whether
to
rank
her
with
servants
stenographers
or
teachers
but
the
leading
ladies
see
the
daily
corinthian
were
very
sure
of
themselves
this
young
woman
worked
for
wages
in
the
homes
of
people
waited
on
people
therefore
she
was
a
working
girl
a
servant
no
one
wasted
much
time
with
the
stranger
the
introduction
was
acknowledged
with
a
word
or
a
cool
nod
and
an
unintelligible
murmur
of
something
that
meant
nothing
or
worse
with
a
patronizing
air
a
sham
cordiality
elaborately
assumed
which
said
plainly
i
acknowledge
the
introduction
here
because
this
is
the
lord
business
you
will
be
sure
please
that
you
make
no
mistake
should
we
chance
to
meet
again
and
immediately
the
new
arrival
would
produce
the
modern
weapon
of
the
christian
warfare
needle
thread
and
thimble
and
hurrying
to
the
side
of
some
valiant
comrade
of
her
own
set
join
bravely
in
the
fray
that
quilt
was
attacked
with
a
spirit
that
was
worth
at
least
a
half
column
in
the
denominational
weekly
while
the
sound
of
the
conflict
might
almost
have
been
heard
as
far
as
widow
mulhall
garden
where
denny
was
cheerily
digging
away
with
his
one
good
side
while
the
useless
crippled
arm
swung
from
the
twisted
shoulder
to
miss
farwell
sitting
quietly
unobserved
but
observing
there
came
a
confused
sound
of
many
voices
speaking
at
once
with
now
and
then
a
sentence
in
a
tone
stronger
than
the
common
din
she
said
the
memorial
church
did
believe
in
the
spirit
anyhow
and
that
all
we
wanted
was
to
get
in
i
told
them
that
brother
matthews
would
surely
be
getting
some
of
their
folks
before
the
year
was
out
if
they
kept
on
coming
to
our
services
i
says
says
i
matthews
never
said
that
you
better
read
your
bible
if
you
can
show
me
in
the
book
where
you
get
your
authority
for
it
i
quit
the
memorial
church
right
then
and
join
yours
yes
all
their
people
were
out
sure
he
their
church
clerk
i
heard
him
say
with
my
own
ears
that
brother
matthews
was
the
biggest
preacher
that
had
ever
been
in
corinth
i
venture
that
sermon
next
sunday
on
christian
ministry
will
give
them
something
to
think
about
the
old
doctor
never
misses
a
service
now
would
it
be
great
if
we
was
to
get
him
that
solo
the
sweetest
thing
wish
he
would
join
we
be
sure
of
him
then
they
would
like
mighty
well
to
get
him
away
from
us
if
they
could
he
stay
fast
enough
as
long
as
charity
plays
the
organ
there
was
a
laugh
at
this
last
from
a
group
near
the
window
and
miss
charity
blushed
as
she
answered
i
worked
hard
enough
to
get
him
and
i
certainly
intend
to
keep
him
if
i
can
i
been
urging
all
the
girls
to
be
particularly
nice
to
him
someone
nearer
to
miss
farwell
said
in
low
tone
of
course
nothing
in
it
charity
just
keeping
him
in
the
choir
she
think
of
anyone
but
the
preacher
i
tell
you
if
brother
matthews
knows
what
best
for
him
he
wo
miss
that
chance
i
guess
if
the
truth
was
known
old
nathan
about
the
best
fixed
of
anyone
in
corinth
sometimes
a
group
would
put
their
heads
closer
together
and
by
the
quick
glances
in
her
direction
the
nurse
felt
that
she
was
contributing
her
full
share
to
the
success
of
the
meeting
on
one
of
these
occasions
she
turned
her
back
on
the
company
to
speak
a
few
words
to
her
patient
who
was
sitting
in
an
easy
chair
a
little
apart
from
the
circle
the
invalid
face
was
all
aglow
is
it
fine
she
said
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
out
of
the
world
it
so
kind
of
these
dear
sisters
to
have
the
meeting
here
today
so
that
i
could
look
on
it
so
good
of
you
too
dear
to
stay
so
they
could
come
she
laughed
do
you
know
i
think
they
all
a
little
bit
afraid
of
you
the
nurse
smiled
and
was
about
to
reply
when
there
was
a
sudden
hush
in
the
room
and
her
patient
whispered
excitedly
he
come
now
you
get
to
meet
our
minister
strong
voice
in
the
hall
could
be
heard
greeting
the
new
arrival
and
answering
her
the
deeper
tones
of
a
man
voice
miss
farwell
started
where
had
she
heard
that
voice
before
then
she
felt
him
enter
the
room
and
heard
the
ladies
greeting
him
something
held
her
from
turning
and
she
remained
with
her
back
to
the
company
watching
her
patient
face
as
the
eyes
of
the
invalid
followed
the
minister
about
the
room
charity
alone
was
noting
the
young
woman
too
obvious
lack
of
interest
the
hum
had
already
commenced
again
when
strong
hand
was
placed
lightly
on
the
nurse
arm
miss
farwell
i
want
you
to
meet
our
minister
reverend
matthews
there
was
an
amused
smile
on
dan
face
as
he
held
out
his
hand
i
believe
miss
farwell
and
i
have
met
before
but
the
young
woman
ignored
the
hand
and
her
voice
had
an
edge
as
she
answered
it
is
possible
sir
i
am
forced
to
meet
so
many
strangers
in
my
profession
you
know
but
i
i
have
forgotten
you
charity
was
still
watching
suspiciously
at
the
minister
words
she
started
and
a
touch
of
color
came
into
her
pale
cheeks
while
at
miss
farwell
answer
the
look
of
suspicion
in
her
eyes
deepened
what
could
it
mean
dan
embarrassment
was
unmistakable
before
he
could
find
words
to
reply
the
sick
woman
exclaimed
why
how
strange
do
tell
us
about
it
brother
matthews
was
it
here
in
corinth
in
a
flash
the
minister
saw
his
predicament
if
he
said
he
had
met
the
young
lady
in
corinth
they
would
know
that
it
was
impossible
that
she
should
have
literally
forgotten
him
he
understood
the
meaning
of
her
words
these
women
would
give
them
a
hundred
meanings
if
he
admitted
that
he
was
wrong
and
that
he
had
not
met
her
there
was
always
the
chance
of
the
people
learning
of
that
hour
spent
on
the
academy
grounds
meanwhile
the
young
woman
made
him
understand
that
she
realized
the
difficulties
of
his
position
and
all
awaited
his
next
words
with
interest
looking
straight
into
her
eyes
he
said
i
seem
to
have
made
a
mistake
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
farwell
she
smiled
it
was
almost
as
good
as
if
he
had
deliberately
lied
but
it
was
the
best
he
could
do
please
do
not
mention
it
she
returned
with
a
meaning
for
him
alone
i
am
sorry
that
i
will
not
be
here
next
sunday
to
hear
your
sermon
on
christian
ministry
so
many
have
urged
me
to
attend
there
is
no
doubt
it
will
be
interesting
you
are
leaving
corinth
then
he
asked
at
the
same
moment
her
patient
and
strong
exclaimed
oh
miss
hope
we
thought
you
had
decided
to
stay
we
ca
let
you
go
so
soon
she
turned
from
the
man
to
answer
the
invalid
yes
i
must
go
i
did
not
know
the
last
time
we
talked
it
over
but
something
has
happened
since
that
makes
it
necessary
i
shall
leave
tomorrow
and
now
if
you
will
excuse
me
please
i
will
run
away
for
a
few
moments
to
get
my
things
together
you
are
doing
so
nicely
you
really
do
need
me
at
all
and
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
stay
longer
now
that
i
have
met
the
minister
she
bowed
slightly
to
dan
and
slipped
from
the
room
the
women
looked
significantly
at
one
another
and
the
minister
too
came
in
for
his
full
share
of
the
curious
glances
there
was
something
in
the
incident
that
they
could
not
understand
and
because
dan
was
a
man
they
naturally
felt
that
he
was
somehow
to
blame
it
was
not
long
until
charity
under
the
pretext
of
showing
him
a
sacred
song
which
she
had
found
in
one
of
strong
books
led
him
to
another
room
away
from
the
curious
crowd
all
the
week
dan
had
looked
forward
to
this
meeting
of
the
ladies
aid
society
for
he
knew
that
he
would
see
the
nurse
again
charmed
by
the
young
woman
personality
and
mind
and
filled
with
his
purpose
to
win
her
to
the
church
he
was
determined
if
chance
did
not
bring
it
about
to
seek
another
opportunity
to
talk
with
her
he
had
smiled
often
to
himself
at
what
he
thought
would
be
a
good
joke
between
them
when
she
came
to
know
of
his
calling
like
many
such
jokes
it
was
not
so
funny
after
all
instead
of
laughing
with
him
she
had
given
him
to
understand
that
the
incident
was
closed
that
there
must
be
no
attempt
on
his
part
to
continue
the
acquaintance
that
indeed
she
would
not
acknowledge
that
she
had
ever
met
him
and
that
she
was
so
much
in
earnest
that
she
was
leaving
corinth
the
next
day
because
of
him
really
brother
matthews
if
i
have
offended
you
in
any
way
i
am
very
sorry
dan
awoke
with
a
start
he
and
charity
were
alone
in
the
room
from
the
open
door
came
the
busy
hum
of
the
workers
in
the
vineyard
i
beg
your
pardon
what
were
you
saying
he
murmured
i
have
asked
you
three
times
if
you
liked
the
music
last
sunday
apologizingly
he
answered
really
i
am
not
fit
company
for
anyone
today
i
noticed
that
you
seemed
troubled
can
i
help
you
in
any
way
is
it
the
church
she
asked
gently
he
laughed
oh
no
it
nothing
that
anyone
can
help
it
myself
please
do
bother
about
it
i
believe
if
you
will
excuse
me
and
make
my
excuses
to
the
ladies
in
there
i
will
go
i
really
have
some
work
to
do
she
was
watching
his
face
so
closely
that
she
had
not
noticed
the
nurse
who
passed
the
window
and
entered
the
garden
dan
rose
to
his
feet
as
he
spoke
why
brother
matthews
the
ladies
expect
you
to
stay
for
their
business
meeting
you
know
this
is
very
strange
strange
there
is
nothing
strange
about
it
i
have
more
important
matters
that
demand
my
attention
that
is
all
it
is
not
necessary
to
interrupt
them
now
you
can
explain
when
the
business
meeting
opens
they
would
excuse
me
i
am
sure
if
they
knew
how
important
it
was
and
before
poor
charity
had
time
to
fairly
grasp
the
situation
he
was
gone
slipping
into
the
hall
for
his
hat
and
out
by
a
side
door
miss
farwell
from
meeting
the
minister
had
gone
directly
to
her
room
but
she
could
not
go
about
her
packing
dropping
into
a
chair
by
the
window
she
sat
staring
into
the
tops
of
the
big
maples
she
did
not
see
the
trees
she
saw
a
vast
stretch
of
rolling
country
dotted
with
and
stacks
across
which
the
flying
raced
a
yard
with
a
gap
in
the
fence
an
old
deserted
school
building
and
a
big
man
standing
with
the
on
his
hair
and
he
he
was
that
she
had
thought
him
something
so
fine
and
strong
he
seemed
so
made
for
fine
and
strong
things
and
he
had
let
her
go
on
leading
her
to
talk
as
she
would
have
talked
only
to
intimate
friends
who
would
understand
she
had
so
wanted
him
to
understand
and
then
he
had
thought
it
all
a
joke
the
gray
eyes
filled
with
angry
tears
and
the
fine
chin
quivered
she
sprang
to
her
feet
i
wo
she
said
aloud
i
wo
why
should
she
indeed
think
a
second
time
of
this
stranger
this
preacher
the
room
seemed
close
she
felt
that
she
could
not
stay
another
minute
in
the
house
with
those
people
down
stairs
catching
up
a
book
she
crept
down
the
back
way
and
on
out
to
a
vine
covered
arbor
that
stood
in
a
secluded
corner
of
the
garden
miss
farwell
had
been
in
her
retreat
but
a
few
minutes
when
the
sound
of
a
step
on
the
gravel
walk
startled
her
then
the
doorway
was
darkened
by
a
tall
figure
and
a
voice
said
may
i
come
in
the
gray
eyes
flashed
once
in
his
direction
then
she
calmly
opened
her
book
without
a
further
glance
or
a
sign
to
betray
her
knowledge
of
his
presence
may
i
come
in
he
asked
again
she
turned
a
page
seeming
not
to
hear
once
more
the
man
repeated
the
same
words
slowly
sadly
the
young
woman
turned
another
page
of
her
book
then
suddenly
the
doorway
was
empty
she
rose
quickly
from
her
place
and
started
forward
then
she
stopped
charity
met
him
on
his
way
to
the
gate
have
you
finished
that
important
business
so
soon
she
asked
sharply
then
with
concern
at
the
expression
of
his
face
she
exclaimed
tell
me
wo
you
what
is
the
matter
he
tried
to
laugh
and
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
not
his
voice
at
all
the
daughter
of
the
church
turned
to
watch
her
minister
as
he
passed
through
the
gate
out
of
the
yard
and
down
the
street
then
she
went
slowly
down
the
path
to
the
arbor
where
she
found
a
young
woman
crouched
on
the
wooden
bench
weeping
bitter
tears
a
book
on
the
floor
at
her
feet
quickly
charity
drew
back
very
quietly
she
went
down
the
walk
again
and
as
she
went
she
seemed
all
at
once
to
have
grown
whiter
and
thin
and
old
chapter
xiii
harry
case
or
whoever
is
responsible
for
the
existence
of
such
people
and
such
conditions
is
a
problem
for
the
age
to
solve
the
fact
is
they
are
here
the
meeting
of
the
ladies
aid
adjourned
and
its
members
with
sighs
and
exclamations
of
satisfaction
over
work
well
done
separated
to
go
to
their
homes
where
there
were
suppers
to
prepare
for
hungry
husbands
and
children
of
the
flesh
thus
always
in
the
scheme
of
things
as
they
are
the
duties
of
life
conflict
with
the
duties
of
religion
the
faithful
members
of
memorial
church
were
always
being
interrupted
in
their
work
for
the
lord
by
the
demands
of
the
world
and
as
they
saw
it
there
was
nothing
for
them
to
do
but
to
bear
their
crosses
bravely
what
a
blessed
thought
it
is
that
god
understands
many
things
that
are
beyond
our
ken
the
whistles
blew
for
quitting
time
the
six
train
from
the
west
pulled
into
the
yards
stopped
puffing
a
few
moments
at
the
water
tank
and
thundered
on
its
way
again
on
the
street
business
men
and
those
who
labored
with
their
hands
hurried
from
the
scenes
of
their
daily
toil
while
the
country
folk
untied
their
teams
and
from
the
to
return
to
their
waiting
families
and
stock
on
the
distant
farms
a
few
miles
out
on
the
main
road
leading
northward
the
farmers
passed
a
tired
horse
hitched
to
a
dusty
plodding
steadily
toward
the
village
without
exception
they
hailed
the
driver
of
the
single
rig
heartily
it
was
harry
returning
from
a
case
in
the
backwoods
country
beyond
hebron
the
bay
known
to
every
child
for
miles
around
was
picking
her
own
way
over
the
country
roads
for
the
lines
hung
slack
without
a
hint
from
her
driver
the
good
horse
slowed
to
a
walk
on
the
rough
places
and
quickened
her
pace
again
when
the
road
was
good
and
of
her
own
accord
turned
out
for
the
passing
teams
the
man
in
the
buggy
returned
the
greetings
of
his
friends
mechanically
scarcely
noticing
who
they
were
it
was
jo
mason
wife
this
time
jo
was
a
good
fellow
but
wholly
incapable
of
grasping
the
problem
of
daily
life
for
himself
and
brood
there
were
ten
children
in
almost
as
many
years
understanding
so
little
of
life
responsibilities
the
man
dependence
upon
his
wife
was
pitiful
if
not
criminal
with
tears
streaming
down
his
lean
hungry
face
he
had
begged
do
somethin
doc
my
god
almighty
you
jest
got
to
do
for
hours
harry
had
been
trying
to
do
something
out
there
in
the
woods
in
that
wretched
home
with
only
a
neighbor
woman
of
the
same
class
to
help
he
had
been
fighting
a
losing
fight
and
now
while
the
bay
mare
was
making
her
tired
way
home
he
was
still
fighting
still
trying
to
do
something
his
professional
knowledge
and
experience
told
him
that
he
could
not
win
that
at
best
he
could
do
no
more
than
delay
his
defeat
a
few
days
and
his
common
sense
urged
him
to
dismiss
the
case
from
his
mind
but
there
was
something
in
harry
stronger
than
his
common
sense
something
greater
than
his
professional
skill
and
so
he
must
go
on
fighting
until
the
very
end
it
was
nearly
twilight
when
he
reached
the
edge
of
the
hill
on
the
farther
side
of
the
valley
he
could
see
the
lights
of
the
town
twinkling
against
the
dark
mass
of
tree
and
hill
and
building
while
on
the
sky
the
steeple
of
memorial
church
the
cupola
of
the
old
academy
building
and
the
tower
were
cut
in
black
down
into
the
dusk
of
the
valley
the
bay
picked
her
way
and
when
they
had
gained
the
hill
on
the
edge
of
town
it
was
dark
now
the
tired
horse
quickened
her
pace
for
the
home
barn
and
uncle
george
were
not
far
away
but
as
they
drew
near
the
big
brown
house
of
judge
strong
she
felt
the
first
touch
of
the
reins
and
came
to
a
walk
turning
in
to
the
familiar
hitching
post
with
reluctance
at
that
moment
a
tall
figure
left
the
judge
gate
to
pass
swiftly
down
the
street
in
the
dusk
before
the
bay
quite
came
to
a
stop
at
the
post
her
master
hand
turned
her
head
into
the
street
again
and
his
familiar
voice
bade
her
somewhat
sharply
to
go
on
in
mild
surprise
she
broke
into
a
quick
trot
how
was
the
good
horse
to
know
that
her
driver
impatience
was
all
with
himself
and
was
caused
by
seeing
his
friend
the
minister
coming
as
he
thought
from
the
strong
mansion
or
how
was
harry
to
know
that
dan
had
only
paused
at
the
gate
as
if
to
enter
and
had
passed
on
when
he
saw
the
physician
turning
in
farther
down
the
street
at
the
little
white
cottage
near
the
monument
the
bay
mare
was
pulled
again
to
a
walk
and
this
time
she
was
permitted
to
turn
in
to
the
curb
and
stop
the
old
doctor
was
sitting
on
the
porch
hello
he
called
cheerily
come
in
not
tonight
thank
you
doctor
i
ca
stop
answered
the
younger
man
at
his
words
the
old
physician
left
his
chair
and
came
stiffly
down
the
walk
to
the
buggy
when
he
was
quite
close
with
one
hand
grasping
the
seat
harry
said
in
a
low
tone
i
just
in
from
mason
ah
huh
grunted
the
other
then
inquiringly
well
it
it
pretty
bad
doctor
the
old
man
voice
rumbled
up
from
the
depth
of
his
chest
nothing
to
do
eh

know
i
told
you
it
was
there
been
in
her
family

a
girl

knew

was
of
no
use
of
course
but
you
know
how
it
is
doctor
the
white
head
nodded
understandingly
as
harry
hand
was
slowly
raised
to
his
eyes
yes
i
know
harry
jo
take
it
pretty
bad
could
do
anything
with
him
poor
fellow
and
those
children
too
both
men
were
silent
slowly
the
younger
man
took
up
the
reins
i
just
stopped
to
tell
you
doctor
ah
huh

you
go
home
and
rest

a
good
night

will

night
doctor
good
night
harry
the
mare
trotted
on
down
the
dark
street
past
the
twinkling
lights
the
doctor
stood
by
the
curb
until
he
heard
the
buggy
wheels
rattle
over
the
railroad
tracks
then
turned
to
walk
stiffly
back
to
his
seat
on
the
porch
soon
the
tired
horse
was
in
the
hands
of
old
uncle
george
while
mam
liz
ministered
to
the
weary
doctor
the
old
black
woman
lingered
in
the
dining
room
after
serving
his
dinner
hovering
about
the
table
calling
his
attention
to
various
dishes
watching
his
face
the
while
with
an
expression
of
anxiety
upon
her
own
wrinkled
countenance
at
last
harry
looked
up
at
her
with
a
smile
well

the

mournfully
harry

least
six
of
other
folks
cooking
fact
he
added
grimly
i
believe
i
might
safely
say
a
dozen
then
he
gave
her
a
laughing
description
of
his
attempt
to
cook
breakfast
for
himself
and
the
ten
children
at
the
masons
that
morning
the
old
woman
was
proudly

have
have
what
a
call
to
serve
such
as
them
he
repeated
her
words
slowly
i
know
why
they
are
or
how
they
came
to
be
whatever
or
whoever
is
responsible
for
the
existence
of
such
people
and
such
conditions
is
a
problem
for
the
age
to
solve
the
fact
is
they
are
here
and
while
the
age
is
solving
the
problem
i
am
sure
that
we
as
individuals
have
a
call
to
personally
minister
to
their
immediate
needs
the
doctor
had
spoken
half
to
himself
following
a
thought
that
was
often
in
his
mind
it
was
a
little
too
much
for
the
old
servant
she
watched
him
with
a
puzzled
expression
on
her
face
talkin

she
coaxed
following
him
into
the
hall
yo
plumb
tuckered
the
weary
physician
looked
through
the
door
into
the
library
where
the
lamp
threw
a
soft
light
over
the
big
table
the
magazines
and
papers
lay
unopened
just
as
they
had
been
brought
from
the
office
by
uncle
george
a
book
that
for
a
month
harry
had
been
trying
to
read
was
lying
where
he
had
dropped
it
to
answer
a
call
while
he
hesitated
the
old
negro
came
shuffling
in
with
the
doctor
smoking
jacket
and
slippers

old

else
sah
no
good
night
sah
good
night
mars
harry
they
slipped
noiselessly
from
the
room
is
there
after
all
anything
more
beautiful
in
life
than
the
ministry
of
such
humble
ones
whose
service
is
the
only
expression
of
their
love
many
of
the
master
truths
have
been
shamefully
neglected
by
those
into
whose
hands
they
were
committed
many
of
his
grandest
lessons
are
ignored
by
his
disciples
who
ambitious
for
place
and
power
quarrel
among
themselves
many
of
his
noblest
laws
have
been
twisted
out
of
all
resemblance
to
his
spirit
by
those
who
interpret
them
to
meet
the
demands
of
their
own
particular
sects
and
systems
but
of
all
the
truths
the
master
has
given
to
men
none
perhaps
has
been
more
neglected
or
abused
than
the
simple
truth
he
illustrated
so
vividly
when
he
washed
his
disciples
feet
left
alone
harry
picked
up
one
magazine
after
another
only
to
turn
the
leaves
impatiently
and
after
a
moment
toss
them
aside
he
glanced
at
his
medical
journal
and
found
it
dull
he
took
up
his
book
only
to
lay
it
down
again
decidedly
he
could
not
read
the
house
with
its
empty
rooms
was
so
big
and
still
he
seated
himself
at
his
piano
but
had
scarcely
touched
the
keys
when
he
rose
again
to
go
to
the
window
after
all
he
thought
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
gone
to
prayer
meeting
i
am
not
fit
to
be
alone
tonight
if
i
could
only
go
to
bed
and
sleep
but
i
feel
as
if
i
had
forgotten
how
those
masons
certainly
got
on
my
nerves
indeed
the
strain
was
plainly
visible
for
his
face
was
worn
and
haggard
in
his
ears
poor
jo
prayer
was
ringing
do
somethin
doc
my
god
almighty
you
jest
got
to
do
somethin
turning
from
the
window
the
doctor
eyes
fell
on
his
medicine
case
which
uncle
george
had
brought
in
from
the
buggy
and
placed
near
the
hall
door
why
not
he
thought
picking
up
the
case
he
went
to
the
table
where
he
opened
it
hesitatingly
after
all
why
not
he
repeated
i
would
give
it
to
a
patient
in
my
condition
but
the
patient
would
know
what
it
was
a
voice
within
himself
answered
i
need
something
i
his
hand
went
out
toward
the
case
i
have
never
done
it
before
you
have
seen
others
who
have
said
the
voice
again
this
is
an
exceptionally
trying
time
he
argued
there
will
be
many
more
such
times
in
your
practice
but
i
must
get
some
rest
he
cried
i
must
he
reached
again
for
the
open
case
but
paused
startled
by
the
ringing
of
the
obeying
the
impulse
of
the
moment
he
dropped
into
his
chair
and
caught
up
a
paper
mam
liz
voice
in
guarded
tones
came
from
the
hall
yes
marm
he
to
home
but
he
plumb
tuckered
out
is
yo
got
to
see
him
yo
wantin
him
to
go
out
agin
is
yo
another
voice
answered
but
the
listening
doctor
could
not
distinguish
the
reply
oh
sho
mam
come
in
come
in
he
in
the
library
a
moment
the
nurse
stood
hesitating
in
the
doorway
harry
sprang
to
his
feet
miss
farwell
i
glad
to
see
you
i
then
he
stopped
looking
at
her
in
astonishment
very
softly
she
closed
the
door
behind
her
and
going
to
the
table
closed
the
medicine
case
then
lifting
her
eyes
to
him
with
a
meaning
look
she
said
simply
i
am
glad
too
he
turned
his
face
away
you
you
saw
the
window
shades
were
up
i
could
not
help
it
he
dropped
into
the
chair
i
a
weak
fool
miss
farwell
no
man
in
my
profession
has
a
right
to
be
so
weak
yes
that
it
she
said
gently
your
profession
those
who
depend
upon
you
for
their
own
lives
and
the
lives
of
their
dear
ones
you
must
remember
that
always
your
ministry
he
raised
his
face
and
looked
at
her
squarely
i
never
did
this
before
you
believe
me
miss
farwell
that
this
is
the
first
time
she
returned
his
look
frankly
yes
she
said
i
believe
you
and
i
believe
it
will
be
the
last
and
it
was
for
there
was
something
in
that
voice
something
in
the
calm
still
depth
of
those
gray
eyes
that
remained
with
harry
abbott
and
whenever
afterwards
he
reached
the
limit
of
his
strength
whenever
he
gave
so
much
of
himself
in
the
service
of
others
that
there
was
nothing
left
for
himself
this
incident
came
back
to
him
that
something
held
him
kept
him
strong
very
quickly
the
nurse
changed
the
subject
and
led
the
physician
mind
away
from
the
sadness
and
horror
of
his
work
that
had
so
nearly
wrought
such
havoc
the
big
empty
house
no
longer
seemed
so
big
and
empty
she
made
him
light
his
pipe
again
and
soon
the
man
felt
his
tired
nerves
relax
while
the
weary
brain
ceased
to
hammer
away
at
the
problems
it
could
not
solve
then
at
last
she
told
him
why
she
had
come
to
bid
him
but
i
thought
you
were
going
to
stay
he
cried
i
had
thought
of
doing
so
she
admitted
but
something
something
makes
it
necessary
for
me
to
go
his
arguments
and
pleadings
were
in
vain
her
only
answer
was
i
can
not
abbott
truly
i
can
not
nor
would
she
tell
him
more
than
that
it
was
necessary
for
her
to
go
but
we
need
you
so
i
need
you
there
is
no
one
can
take
your
place
hope
then
he
stopped
she
was
frankly
permitting
him
to
look
deep
into
her
eyes
i
am
sorry
doctor
but
i
must
go
and
the
strength
of
her
held
him
and
made
him
strong
just
one
thing
miss
farwell
you
are
not
going
because
of
because
of
me
she
held
out
her
hand
no
indeed
doctor
whatever
you
think
please
do
think
that
he
would
have
accompanied
her
home
but
she
would
not
permit
it
and
insisted
so
strongly
that
he
retire
at
once
that
he
was
forced
to
yield
but
he
would
not
say
declaring
that
he
would
be
at
the
depot
in
the
morning
to
see
her
off
oldham
coming
home
from
prayer
meeting
found
her
husband
still
sitting
on
the
porch
when
she
could
not
force
him
to
listen
to
reason
and
go
to
bed
she
left
him
to
his
thoughts
a
little
later
the
old
doctor
saw
the
tall
form
of
the
minister
turn
in
at
the
gate
opposite
then
the
light
in
the
corner
window
flashed
brightly
a
few
moments
more
and
he
saw
a
woman
coming
down
the
street
going
toward
judge
strong
nearing
the
house
across
the
way
she
slackened
her
pace
walking
very
slowly
under
the
corner
window
she
almost
stopped
as
she
went
on
she
turned
once
to
look
back
then
disappeared
under
the
trees
in
the
dusk
it
was
almost
morning
when
miss
farwell
was
awakened
by
a
loud
knocking
at
the
front
door
then
strong
came
quickly
up
stairs
to
the
room
the
young
woman
was
on
her
feet
instantly
that
old
negro
of
abbott
is
here
asking
for
you
explained
strong
he
says

him
and
that

the
world

it
mean

xiv

slipping
into
her
clothing
the
nurse
went
down
to
the
front
door
where
uncle

was
waiting
a
horse
and
buggy
stood
at
the
front
gate

the
latter
part
of
this
speech
was
delivered
to
the
empty
doorway
the
nurse
was
already
back
in
her
room
the
old
negro
rubbed
his
chin
with
a
trembling
hand
as
he
turned
with
a
puzzled
look
on
his
black
face
from
the
open
door
to
the
horse
and
buggy
and
back
to
the
door
again
dat

fully

and

to

i

enough
the
black
horse
was
covering
the
ground
at
a
pace
that
fairly
took
miss
farwell
breath
the
quick
steady
beat
of
the
feet
and
the
rattle
of
the
buggy
wheels
echoed
loudly
in
the
gray
stillness
above
the
tops
of
the
giant
maples
that
lined
the
road
the
nurse
saw
the
stars
paling
in
the
first
faint
glow
of
the
coming
day
while
here
and
there
in
the
homes
of
some
workers
the
lights
flashed
out
and
the
people
with
the
name
of
harry
on
their
lips
paused
to
listen
to
the
hurried
passing
of
big
jim

while
the
old
negro
was
speaking
the
big
horse
was
whirling
them
through
the
quiet
streets
of
the
village
as
uncle
george
finished
they
reached
the
top
of
academy
hill
where
miss
farwell
saw
the
old
school
building
ghostly
and
still
in
the
mists
that
hung
about
it
like
a
shroud
the
fence
with
the
gap
leading
into
the
yard
the
grassy
knoll
and
the
oak
all
wet
and
sodden
now
and
below
the
valley
with
its
homes
and
fields
hidden
in
the
thick
fog
suggestive
of
hidden
and
mysterious
depths
is
yo
cold
miss
we
mos
dar
now
the
nurse
had
shivered
as
with
a
sudden
chill
turning
sharply
to
the
north
a
minute
later
they
entered
the
square
of
old
town
where
a
herd
of
lean
cows
were
just
getting
up
from
their
beds
to
pick
a
scanty
breakfast
from
the
grass
that
grew
where
once
the
farmer
folk
had
tied
their
teams
and
in
front
of
the
ruined
structure
that
had
once
been
the
principal
store
of
the
village
a
mother
sow
grunted
to
her
squealing
brood
long
without
touch
of
painter
brush
the
few
wretched
buildings
that
remained
were
the
color
of
the
mist
to
the
nurse
like
the
fog
that
hid
the
valley
they
suggested
cold
mysterious
depths
of
life
untouched
by
any
ray
of
promised
sun
and
out
of
that
dull
gray
abyss
a
woman
voice
broke
sharply
on
the
stillness
in
a
scream
of
pain
dat
her
dat
de
gal
now
nurse
up
dare
where
yo
sees
dat
light
uncle
george
brought
the
big
black
to
a
stand
in
front
of
the
ancient
and
a
frame
building
with
the
stairway
on
the
outside
a
group
of
negroes
huddled
with
awed
faces
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
drew
back
as
the
nurse
sprang
from
the
buggy
and
ran
lightly
up
the
shaky
old
steps
the
narrow
dirty
hallway
was
crowded
with
more
negroes
the
odor
of
the
place
was
sickening
miss
farwell
pushed
her
way
through
and
entered
the
room
where
harry
assisted
by
a
big
black
woman
was
holding
his
struggling
patient
on
the
bed
the
walls
and
ceiling
of
the
room
stained
by
the
accumulated
smoke
of
years
the
rough
bare
floor
the
window
without
shade
or
curtain
the
only
furniture
a
rude
table
and
a
chair
or
two
a
little
stove
set
on
broken
bricks
a
handful
of
battered
dishes
and
cooking
utensils
a
trunk
and
the
bed
with
its
ragged
quilts
and
comforts
all
cried
aloud
the
old
old
familiar
cry
of
bitter
poverty
harry
glanced
up
as
the
nurse
entered
carbolic
acid
he
said
quietly
but
she
did
get
quite
enough
i
managed
to
give
her
the
antidote
and
a
hypodermic
we
better
repeat
the
hypodermic
i
think
without
a
word
the
nurse
took
her
place
at
the
bedside
when
the
patient
under
the
influence
of
the
drug
had
grown
more
quiet
harry
dismissed
the
negro
woman
with
a
few
kind
words
and
the
promise
that
he
would
send
for
her
if
she
could
help
them
in
any
way
then
when
he
had
sent
the
others
away
from
the
room
and
the
hallway
he
turned
to
the
nurse
miss
farwell
i
am
sorry
that
i
was
forced
to
send
for
you
but
you
can
see
that
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
i
knew
you
would
come
without
loss
of
time
and
i
dared
not
leave
her
without
a
white
woman
in
the
room
he
paused
and
went
to
the
bedside
poor
poor
little
girl
she
tried
so
hard
to
die
nurse
she
will
try
again
the
moment
she
regains
consciousness
these
good
colored
people
would
do
anything
for
her
but
she
must
see
one
of
her
own
race
when
she
opens
her
eyes
he
paused
seemingly
at
a
loss
for
words
miss
farwell
spoke
for
the
first
time
she
is
a
good
girl
doctor
not
that
it
matters
you
know
but
harry
spoke
positively
yes
she
is
a
good
girl
it
is
not
that
nurse
then
how
miss
farwell
glanced
around
the
room
then
why
is
she
here
no
one
ever
heard
harry
abbott
speak
a
bitter
word
but
there
was
a
strange
note
in
his
voice
as
he
answered
slowly
she
is
here
because
there
seems
to
be
no
other
place
for
her
to
go
she
did
this
because
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
else
for
her
to
do
then
briefly
he
related
the
sad
history
of
this
good
girl
with
a
bad
reputation
oldham
and
i
tried
to
help
her
he
said
but
some
ugly
stories
got
started
and
somehow
grace
heard
them
after
that
she
avoided
us
for
a
little
while
there
was
silence
in
the
room
when
harry
again
turned
from
his
patient
to
the
nurse
miss
farwell
was
busily
writing
upon
his
tablet
of
prescription
blanks
with
a
stub
of
a
pencil
which
she
had
taken
from
her
pocket
the
doctor
watched
her
curiously
for
a
moment
then
arose
and
taking
his
hat
said
briskly
i
will
not
keep
you
longer
than
an
hour
miss
farwell
i
think
i
know
of
a
woman
whom
i
can
get
for
today
at
least
and
perhaps
by
tonight
we
can
find
someone
else
or
arrange
it
somehow
i
be
back
in
plenty
of
time
so
do
worry
your
train
does
not
go
until
you
know
if
the
woman
ca
come
at
once
i
ask
oldham
to
relieve
you
the
nurse
looked
at
him
with
smiling
eyes
i
am
very
sorry
abbott
if
i
am
not
giving
satisfaction
she
said
the
physician
returned
her
look
with
amazement
not
giving
satisfaction
what
in
the
world
do
you
mean
why
you
seem
to
be
dismissing
me
she
answered
demurely
i
understood
that
you
sent
for
me
to
take
this
case
at
the
light
that
broke
over
his
face
she
dropped
her
eyes
and
wrote
another
line
on
the
paper
before
her
do
you
mean
he
began
then
he
stopped
i
mean
she
answered
that
unless
you
send
me
away
i
shall
stay
on
duty
but
dr
miles
that
case
in
chicago
i
understood
from
you
that
it
was
very
important
she
smiled
at
him
again
there
is
nothing
so
important
as
the
thing
that
needs
doing
now
she
answered
and
she
finished
slowly
turning
her
eyes
toward
the
unconscious
girl
on
the
bed
i
do
seem
to
be
needed
here
and
you
understand
there
will
be
no
no
fees
in
this
case
he
asked
the
color
mounted
to
her
face
is
our
work
always
a
question
of
fees
doctor
i
am
surprised
can
not
i
collect
my
bill
when
you
receive
yours
he
held
out
his
hand
impulsively
forgive
me
miss
farwell
but
it
is
too
good
to
be
true
i
ca
say
any
more
now
you
are
needed
here
you
can
not
know
how
badly
i
we
all
need
you
she
gently
released
her
hand
and
he
continued
in
a
more
tone
i
will
go
now
to
make
a
call
or
two
so
that
i
can
be
with
you
later
your
patient
will
be
all
right
for
at
least
three
hours
i
send
uncle
george
with
your
breakfast
never
mind
the
breakfast
she
said
if
you
will
have
your
man
bring
these
things
i
will
get
along
nicely
she
handed
him
a
prescription
blank
here
is
a
list
that
strong
will
give
him
from
my
room
and
here
she
gave
him
another
blank
is
a
list
he
may
get
at
the
grocery
and
here
she
handed
him
the
third
blank
is
a
list
he
may
get
at
some
dry
goods
store
i
have
not
my
purse
with
me
so
he
will
need
to
bring
the
bills
the
merchants
will
know
him
of
course
harry
looked
from
the
slips
in
his
hand
to
the
young
woman
you
must
not
do
that
miss
farwell
really
she
interrupted
doctor
this
is
my
case
you
know
it
was
mine
first
he
answered
grimly
but
doctor
shall
i
send
you
my
bill
too
he
asked
a
few
moments
later
she
heard
the
quick
step
of
big
jim
and
the
rattle
of
the
wheels
two
hours
had
passed
when
in
response
to
a
low
knock
the
nurse
opened
the
door
to
find
oldham
standing
in
the
narrow
hall
the
old
physician
was
breathing
heavily
from
his
effort
in
climbing
the
rickety
stairs
his
arms
were
full
of
roses
miss
farwell
exclaimed
with
delight
oh
doctor
just
what
i
was
wishing
for
uh
huh
he
grunted
i
thought
so
they
do
her
good
harry
told
me
what
you
were
up
to
thought
i
better
come
along
in
case
you
should
need
any
help
he
drew
a
chair
to
the
bedside
while
the
nurse
with
her
sleeves
rolled
up
returned
to
the
work
which
his
knock
at
the
door
had
interrupted
clean
white
sheets
pillows
and
coverings
had
replaced
the
tattered
quilt
on
the
bed
the
floor
was
swept
the
litter
about
the
stove
was
gone
and
in
its
place
was
a
big
armful
of
wood
neatly
piled
the
personal
offering
of
uncle
george
who
had
returned
quickly
with
the
things
for
which
the
nurse
had
sent
the
dirt
and
dust
had
vanished
from
the
windows
the
glaring
light
was
softened
by
some
sort
of
curtain
material
that
the
young
woman
had
managed
to
fix
in
place
the
bare
old
cupboard
shelves
covered
with
fresh
paper
were
filled
with
provisions
and
the
nurse
washing
the
last
of
the
dishes
and
utensils
was
placing
them
carefully
in
order
she
finished
as
oldham
turned
from
the
patient
and
throwing
over
the
rough
table
a
cloth
of
bright
colors
began
deftly
arranging
in
such
dishes
as
the
place
afforded
the
flowers
he
had
brought
already
the
perfume
of
the
roses
was
driving
from
the
chamber
that
peculiar
sickening
odor
of
poverty
the
old
physician
trained
by
long
years
of
service
to
habits
of
close
observation
noted
every
detail
in
the
changed
room
silently
he
watched
the
strong
beautifully
formed
young
woman
in
the
nurse
uniform
bending
over
his
flowers
handling
them
with
the
touch
of
love
while
on
her
face
and
in
the
clear
gray
eyes
shone
the
light
that
a
few
truly
great
painters
have
succeeded
in
giving
to
their
pictures
of
the
mother
mary
the
keen
old
eyes
under
their
white
brows
filled
and
the
doctor
turned
hastily
back
to
the
figure
on
the
bed
a
worn
figure
it
was
thin
and
looking
old
with
lines
of
care
and
anxiety
of
constant
pain
and
ceaseless
fear
of
dread
and
hopelessness
only
a
faint
suggestion
of
youth
was
there
only
a
hint
of
the
beauty
of
young
womanhood
that
might
have
been
nay
that
would
have
been
that
should
have
been
miss
farwell
started
as
the
old
man
with
a
sudden
exclamation
stood
erect
he
faced
the
young
woman
with
blazing
eyes
and
quivering
face
his
voice
shaken
with
passion
as
he
said
nurse
you
and
harry
tell
me
this
is
suicide
he
made
a
gesture
toward
the
still
form
on
the
bed
you
will
tell
the
people
that
this
poor
child
wanted
to
kill
herself
and
the
people
will
call
it
suicide
but
by
god
it
murder
murder
i
tell
you
she
did
not
want
to
kill
herself
she
wanted
to
live
to
be
strong
and
beautiful
like
you
but
this
community
with
its
churches
and
sunday
schools
and
prayer
meetings
would
let
her
they
denied
her
the
poor
privilege
of
working
for
the
food
she
needed
they
refused
even
a
word
of
real
sympathy
they
hounded
her
into
this
stinking
hole
to
live
with
the
negroes
she
may
die
nurse
and
if
she
does
as
truly
as
there
is
a
creator
who
loves
his
creatures
her
death
will
be
upon
the
unspeakably
cruel
pious
churchified
people
in
this
town
it
i
tell
you
by
god
it
the
old
man
dropped
into
his
chair
exhausted
by
his
passionate
outburst
for
a
few
moments
there
was
no
sound
in
the
room
save
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
physician
the
nurse
stood
gazing
at
him
a
look
of
mingled
sadness
and
horror
on
her
face
then
the
figure
on
the
bed
stirred
the
sick
girl
eyes
opened
to
stare
wildly
wonderingly
about
the
room
with
a
low
word
to
the
doctor
miss
farwell

quickly

the
minister
opportunity
he
saw
only
the
opportunity
so
mysteriously
opened
to
him
when
dan
left
miss
farwell
in
the
summer
house
at
judge
strong
he
went
straight
to
his
room
two
or
three
people
whom
he
met
on
the
way
turned
when
he
had
passed
to
look
back
at
him
james
talking
over
the
fence
with
her
next
door
neighbor
wondered
when
he
failed
to
return
her
greeting
and
denny
from
his
garden
hailed
him
joyfully
but
dan
did
not
check
his
pace
reaching
his
own
gate
he
broke
fairly
into
a
run
and
leaping
up
the
stairway
rushed
into
his
room
closing
and
locking
his
door
then
he
stood
breathing
hard
and
smiling
grimly
at
the
foolish
impulse
that
had
made
him
act
for
all
the
world
like
a
thief
escaping
with
his
booty
he
puzzled
over
this
strange
feeling
that
possessed
him
the
feeling
that
he
had
taken
something
that
did
not
belong
to
him
until
the
thought
struck
him
that
there
might
after
all
be
good
reason
for
the
fancy
that
it
might
indeed
be
more
than
a
fancy
pacing
to
and
fro
the
length
of
his
little
study
he
recalled
every
detail
of
that
meeting
in
the
academy
yard
and
as
he
remembered
how
he
had
consciously
refrained
from
making
known
his
position
to
the
young
woman
not
once
but
several
times
when
he
knew
that
he
should
have
spoken
and
how
his
questions
combined
with
the
evident
false
impression
that
his
words
had
given
her
had
led
her
to
speak
thoughts
she
would
never
have
dreamed
of
expressing
had
she
known
him
the
conviction
grew
that
he
had
indeed
like
a
thief
taken
something
that
did
not
belong
to
him
and
as
he
realized
more
and
more
how
his
silence
must
appear
to
her
as
premeditated
and
reflected
how
her
fine
nature
would
shrink
from
what
she
could
not
but
view
as
a
coarse
ungentlemanly
trick
he
grew
hot
with
shame
no
wonder
he
told
himself
that
he
had
instinctively
shrunk
from
looking
into
the
faces
of
the
people
whom
he
had
met
and
had
fled
to
the
privacy
of
his
rooms
dan
did
not
spare
himself
that
afternoon
and
yet
beneath
all
the
self
scorn
he
felt
there
was
a
deeper
conviction
that
he
was
not
at
heart
guilty
of
the
thing
with
which
he
charged
himself
this
very
conviction
though
felt
but
dimly
made
him
rage
the
more
he
had
the
hopeless
feeling
of
one
caught
in
a
trap
of
one
convicted
of
a
crime
of
which
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
he
was
guilty
but
which
he
knew
he
had
unwittingly
committed
the
big
fellow
in
so
closely
analyzing
the
woman
thoughts
and
feelings
and
in
taking
so
completely
her
point
of
view
neglected
himself
he
could
not
realize
how
true
to
he
had
been
that
afternoon
or
how
truly
the
impulse
that
had
prompted
him
to
deny
his
calling
was
an
instinct
of
his
own
strong
manhood
the
instinct
to
be
accepted
or
rejected
for
what
he
was
within
himself
rather
than
for
the
mere
accident
of
his
calling
and
position
in
life
one
thing
was
clear
he
must
see
miss
farwell
again
she
must
listen
to
his
explanation
and
apology
she
must
somehow
understand
for
apart
from
his
interest
in
the
young
woman
herself
there
was
that
purpose
of
the
minister
to
win
her
to
the
church
it
was
a
monstrous
thought
that
he
himself
should
be
the
means
of
strengthening
her
feeling
against
the
cause
to
which
he
had
given
his
life
so
he
had
gone
to
judge
home
early
that
evening
determined
to
see
her
but
at
the
gate
when
he
saw
harry
turning
in
as
if
to
stop
he
had
passed
on
in
the
dusk
later
at
prayer
meeting
his
thoughts
were
far
from
the
subject
under
discussion
his
own
public
petition
was
so
faltering
and
uncertain
that
elder
jordan
watched
him
suspiciously
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
just
how
much
the
interest
of
the
man
in
the
woman
colored
and
strengthened
the
purpose
of
the
preacher
to
win
this
soul
so
antagonistic
to
his
church
the
next
day
dan
was
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
his
sermon
on
the
christian
ministry
when
his
landlady
interrupted
him
with
the
news
of
the
attempted
suicide
in
old
town
upon
hearing
that
the
girl
had
at
one
time
been
a
member
of
his
congregation
he
went
at
once
to
learn
more
of
the
particulars
from
oldham
he
found
his
old
friend
who
had
returned
from
old
town
a
half
hour
before
sitting
in
his
big
chair
on
the
front
porch
gazing
at
the
monument
across
the
way
to
the
young
man
questions
the
doctor
returned
only
monosyllables
or
grunts
and
growls
that
might
mean
anything
or
nothing
at
all
plainly
the
doctor
did
not
wish
to
talk
his
face
was
dark
and
forbidding
and
under
his
scowling
brows
his
eyes
when
dan
caught
a
glimpse
of
them
were
hard
and
fierce
the
young
man
had
never
seen
his
friend
in
such
a
mood
and
he
could
not
understand
dan
did
not
know
that
the
old
physician
had
just
learned
from
his
wife
that
the
girl
with
the
bad
reputation
had
called
at
the
house
to
see
him
a
few
hours
before
she
had
made
the
attempt
to
end
her
life
and
that
she
had
been
sent
away
by
the
careful
martha
with
the
excuse
that
the
doctor
was
too
busy
to
see
her
neither
could
the
boy
know
how
the
old
man
love
for
him
was
keeping
him
silent
lest
in
his
present
frame
of
mind
he
say
things
that
would
strengthen
that
something
which
they
each
felt
had
come
between
them
suddenly
the
doctor
turned
his
gaze
from
the
monument
and
flashed
a
meaning
look
straight
into
the
brown
eyes
of
the
young
minister
she
was
a
member
of
your
church
why
do
you
go
to
see
her
ask
the
nurse
if
there
is
anything
the
church
can
do
as
dan
went
down
the
walk
he
added
tell
miss
farwell
that
i
sent
you
then
smiling
grimly
he
growled
to
himself
you
get
valuable
material
for
that
sermon
on
the
ministry
or
i
miss
my
guess
the
nurse
the
nurse
he
was
to
see
her
again
the
thought
danced
in
dan
brain
how
strangely
the
opportunity
had
come
the
young
minister
felt
that
the
whole
thing
had
in
some
mysterious
way
been
planned
to
the
end
he
desired
in
the
care
that
the
church
would
give
this
poor
girl
the
nurse
would
see
how
wrongly
she
had
judged
it
she
would
be
forced
to
listen
to
him
now
surely
god
had
given
him
this
opportunity
what
the
poor
suicide
oh
but
dan
was
not
thinking
of
the
suicide
that
would
come
later
just
now
his
mind
and
heart
were
too
full
of
his
own
desire
to
win
this
young
woman
to
the
church
he
saw
only
the
opportunity
so
mysteriously
opened
to
him
dan
was
thoroughly
orthodox
so
in
the
brightness
of
the
afternoon
the
pastor
of
memorial
church
went
along
the
street
that
in
the
gray
chill
of
the
early
morning
had
echoed
the
hurried
steps
of
the
doctor
horse
the
homes
so
silent
when
the
nurse
had
passed
on
her
mission
were
now
full
of
life
the
big
trees
dank
and
still
then
now
stirred
softly
in
the
breeze
and
rang
with
the
songs
of
their
feathered
denizens
the
pale
stars
were
lost
in
the
infinite
blue
and
the
sunlight
warmed
and
filled
the
air
flooding
street
and
home
and
lawn
and
flower
and
tree
with
its
golden
beauty
at
the
top
of
academy
hill
dan
paused
for
him
no
shroud
of
mist
wrapped
the
picturesque
old
building
no
fog
of
mysterious
depths
hid
the
charming
landscape
recalling
the
things
the
nurse
had
said
to
him
there
under
the
oak
on
the
grassy
knoll
and
thinking
of
his
sermon
in
answer
he
smiled
it
was
a
good
sermon
he
thought
with
honest
pride
strong
logical
convincing
and
it
was
that
with
a
confident
stride
he
went
on
his
way

miss
farwell
was
alone
with
her
patient
harry
who
had
returned
soon
after
the
girl
regained
consciousness
had
gone
out
into
the
country
promising
to
look
in
again
during
the
evening
on
his
way
home
and
the
old
doctor
finding
that
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
remain
had
left
a
few
moments
later
except
to
answer
their
direct
questions
the
sick
girl
had
spoken
no
word
but
lay
motionless
her
face
turned
toward
the
wall
several
times
the
nurse
tried
gently
to
arouse
her
but
save
for
a
puzzled
look
in
the
eyes
there
was
no
response
though
she
took
her
medicine
obediently
but
when
miss
farwell
after
bathing
the
girl
face
and
brushing
and
braiding
her
hair
dressed
her
in
a
clean
white
gown
the
frightened
defiant
look
gave
place
to
one
of
wondering
gratitude
and
a
little
later
she
seemed
to
sleep
she
was
still
sleeping
when
miss
farwell
who
was
standing
by
the
window
watching
a
group
of
negro
children
playing
ball
in
the
square
saw
a
man
approaching
the
group
from
the
direction
of
the
village
the
young
woman
face
flushed
as
she
recognized
the
unmistakable
figure
of
the
minister
then
an
angry
light
shone
in
the
gray
eyes
and
she
drew
back
with
a
low
exclamation
as
in
evident
answer
to
his
question
a
half
dozen
hands
were
pointed
toward
the
window
where
she
stood
watching
she
saw
him
coming
toward
the
building
his
purpose
was
clear
what
should
she
do
her
first
angry
impulse
was
to
refuse
to
admit
him
what
right
had
he
to
attempt
to
see
her
after
her
so
positive
dismissal
then
she
thought
perhaps
he
was
coming
to
see
the
sick
girl
what
right
had
she
to
refuse
to
admit
him
when
it
could
in
no
way
harm
her
patient
the
room
after
all
was
the
home
of
the
young
woman
on
the
bed
the
nurse
was
only
there
in
her
professional
capacity
miss
farwell
began
to
feel
that
she
was
playing
a
part
in
a
mighty
drama
that
the
cue
had
been
given
for
the
entrance
of
another
actor
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
play
save
to
act
well
her
part
it
was
not
for
her
to
arrange
the
lines
or
manage
the
parts
of
the
other
players
the
feeling
possessed
her
that
indeed
she
had
somewhere
rehearsed
the
scene
many
times
before
stepping
quickly
to
the
bed
she
saw
that
her
patient
was
still
apparently
sleeping
then
she
stood
trembling
listening
to
the
step
in
the
hall
as
dan
approached
he
knocked
the
second
time
before
she
could
summon
strength
to
cross
the
room
and
open
the
door
may
i
come
in
he
asked
hat
in
hand
at
his
words
the
same
that
he
had
spoken
a
few
hours
before
in
the
garden
the
nurse
face
grew
crimson
she
made
no
answer
but
in
the
eyes
that
looked
straight
into
his
dan
read
a
question
and
his
own
face
grew
red
as
he
said
i
called
to
see
your
patient
oldham
asked
me
to
come
certainly
come
in
she
stepped
aside
and
the
minister
entered
the
mechanically
without
a
word
she
placed
a
chair
for
him
near
the
bed
then
crossed
the
room
to
stand
by
the
window
but
he
did
not
sit
down
presently
dan
turned
to
the
nurse
she
is
asleep
he
asked
in
a
low
tone
miss
farwell
answer
was
calmly
unmistakably
professional
looking
at
her
watch
she
answered
she
has
been
sleeping
nearly
two
hours
is
there
will
she
recover
abbott
says
there
is
no
reason
why
she
should
not
if
we
can
turn
her
from
her
determination
to
die
always
dan
had
been
intensely
in
love
with
life
he
had
a
strong
young
man
horror
of
death
he
could
think
of
it
only
as
a
fitting
close
to
a
long
useful
life
or
as
a
possible
release
from
months
of
sickness
and
pain
that
anyone
young
and
in
good
health
with
the
world
of
beauty
and
years
of
usefulness
before
them
with
the
opportunities
and
duties
of
life
calling
should
willfully
seek
to
die
was
a
monstrous
thought
after
all
the
boy
knew
so
little
he
was
only
beginning
to
sense
vaguely
the
great
forces
that
make
and
mar
humankind
at
the
calm
words
of
the
nurse
he
turned
quickly
toward
the
bed
with
a
shudder
her
determination
to
die
he
repeated
in
an
awed
whisper
miss
farwell
was
watching
him
curiously
he
whispered
half
to
himself
wonderingly
why
should
she
wish
to
die
why
should
she
wish
to
live
the
nurse
cold
tones
startled
him
he
turned
to
her
perplexed
wondering
speechless
i
i
do
not
understand
he
said
at
last
i
do
suppose
you
do
she
answered
grimly
how
could
you
your
ministry
is
a
matter
of
schools
and
theories
of
doctrines
and
beliefs
this
is
a
matter
of
life
my
church
he
began
remembering
his
sermon
but
she
interrupted
him
your
church
does
not
understand
either
it
is
so
busy
earning
money
to
pay
its
ministers
that
it
has
no
time
for
such
things
as
this
but
they
do
not
know
he
faltered
i
did
not
dream
that
such
a
thing
as
this
could
be
he
looked
about
the
room
and
then
at
the
still
form
on
the
bed
with
a
shudder
you
a
minister
of
christ
gospel
and
ignorant
of
these
things
and
yet
this
is
not
an
uncommon
case
sir
i
could
tell
you
of
many
similar
cases
that
have
come
under
my
own
observation
though
not
all
of
them
have
chosen
to
die
this
girl
could
have
made
a
living
i
suppose
you
understand
but
she
is
a
good
girl
so
there
was
nothing
for
her
but
this
all
she
asked
was
a
chance
only
a
chance
the
minister
was
silent
he
could
not
answer
the
nurse
continued
what
right
have
you
matthews
to
say
that
you
do
not
understand
that
you
do
not
know
it
is
your
business
to
understand
to
know
and
your
church
what
right
has
it
to
plead
ignorance
of
the
life
about
its
very
doors
if
such
things
are
not
its
business
what
business
has
this
institution
that
professes
to
exist
for
the
salvation
of
men
that
hires
men
like
you
as
you
yourself
told
me
to
minister
to
the
world
what
right
i
say
have
you
or
your
church
to
be
ignorant
of
these
everyday
conditions
of
life
abbott
must
know
his
work
i
must
know
mine
our
teachers
our
legal
and
professional
men
our
public
officers
our
mechanics
and
laborers
must
all
know
and
understand
their
work
the
world
demands
it
of
us
and
the
world
is
beginning
to
demand
that
you
and
your
church
know
your
business
as
the
nurse
spoke
in
low
tones
her
voice
was
filled
with
sorrowful
passionate
earnestness
and
dan
big
dan
sat
like
a
child
before
her
his
face
white
his
brown
eyes
wide
with
that
questioning
look
his
own
voice
trembled
as
he
answered
but
the
people
are
not
beasts
they
do
not
realize
at
heart
they
we
are
kind
we
do
not
mean
to
be
carelessly
cruel
do
you
believe
this
miss
farwell
she
turned
from
him
wearily
as
if
in
despair
at
trying
to
make
him
understand
of
course
i
believe
it
she
answered
but
how
does
that
affect
the
situation
the
same
thing
could
be
said
i
suppose
of
those
who
crucified
the
christ
and
burned
the
martyrs
at
the
stake
it
is
this
system
that
has
enslaved
the
people
that
feeds
itself
upon
the
strength
that
should
be
given
to
their
fellow
men
they
give
so
much
time
and
thought
and
love
to
their
churches
and
creeds
that
they
have
nothing
left
nothing
for
girls
like
these
her
voice
broke
and
she
went
to
the
window
in
the
silence
dan
gazed
at
the
form
on
the
bed
gazed
as
if
fascinated
from
without
came
the
shouts
of
the
negro
boys
at
their
game
of
ball
and
the
sound
of
the
people
moving
about
in
other
parts
of
the
building
is
there
is
there
no
one
who
cares
dan
said
at
last
in
a
hoarse
whisper
no
one
has
made
her
feel
that
they
care
the
nurse
answered
turning
back
to
him
and
her
manner
and
tone
were
cold
again
but
you
he
persisted
surely
you
care
at
this
the
gray
eyes
filled
and
the
full
voice
trembled
as
she
answered
yes
yes
i
care
how
could
i
help
it
oh
if
we
can
only
make
her
feel
that
we
that
someone
wants
her
that
there
is
a
place
for
her
that
there
are
those
who
need
her
she
went
to
the
bedside
and
stood
looking
down
at
the
still
form
i
ca
i
wo
i
wo
let
her
go
let
us
help
you
miss
farwell
said
dan
oldham
suggested
that
i
ask
you
if
the
church
could
not
do
something
i
am
sure
they
would
gladly
help
if
i
were
to
present
the
case
the
nurse
wheeled
on
him
with
indignant
scornful
eyes
he
faltered
this
is
the
churches
work
you
know
yes
she
returned
and
her
words
stung
you
are
quite
right
this
is
the
churches
work
he
gazed
at
her
in
amazement
as
she
continued
hotly
you
have
made
it
very
evident
matthews
that
you
know
nothing
of
this
matter
i
have
no
doubt
that
your
church
members
would
respond
with
a
liberal
collection
if
you
were
to
picture
what
you
have
seen
here
this
afternoon
in
an
eloquent
public
appeal
some
in
the
fullness
of
their
emotions
would
offer
their
personal
service
others
i
am
sure
would
send
flowers
but
i
suggest
that
for
your
sake
before
you
present
this
matter
to
your
church
you
ask
oldham
to
give
you
a
full
history
of
the
case
ask
him
to
tell
you
why
grace
conner
is
trying
to
die
and
now
you
will
pardon
me
but
in
consideration
of
my
patient
who
may
waken
at
any
moment
i
dare
not
take
the
responsibility
of
permitting
you
to
prolong
this
call
too
bewildered
and
hurt
to
attempt
any
reply
he
left
the
room
and
she
stood
listening
to
his
steps
as
he
went
slowly
down
the
hall
and
out
of
the
building
from
the
window
she
watched
as
he
crossed
the
old
square
watched
as
he
passed
from
sight
up
the
street
the
cruel
words
had
leaped
from
her
lips
unbidden
already
she
regretted
them
deeply
she
knew
instinctively
that
the
minister
had
come
from
a
genuine
desire
to
be
helpful
she
should
have
been
more
kind
but
his
unfortunate
words
had
brought
to
her
mind
in
a
flash
the
whole
hideous
picture
of
the
poor
girl
broken
life
and
the
suggestion
of
such
help
as
the
church
would
give
now
came
with
such
biting
irony
that
she
was
almost
beside
herself
the
situation
was
not
at
all
new
to
miss
farwell
her
profession
placed
her
constantly
in
touch
with
such
ministries
she
remembered
a
saloonkeeper
who
had
contributed
liberally
to
the
funeral
expenses
of
a
child
who
had
been
killed
by
its
drunken
father
the
young
woman
had
never
before
spoken
in
such
cruel
anger
was
she
growing
bitter
she
wondered
all
at
once
her
cheeks
were
wet
with
scalding
tears
dan
found
the
doctor
sitting
on
the
porch
just
as
he
had
left
him
was
it
only
an
hour
before
chapter
xvii
the
tragedy
now
for
the
first
time
he
was
face
to
face
with
existing
conditions
not
the
theory
but
the
practice
confronted
him
now
not
the
traditional
but
the
actual
it
was
indeed
a
tragedy
dan
went
heavily
up
the
path
between
the
roses
while
the
doctor
observed
him
closely
the
young
minister
did
not
sit
down
well
said
the
doctor
dan
voice
was
strained
and
unnatural
will
you
come
over
to
my
room
without
a
word
the
old
man
followed
him
in
the
privacy
of
his
little
study
the
boy
said
doctor
you
had
a
reason
for
telling
me
to
ask
miss
farwell
if
the
church
could
do
anything
for
for
that
poor
girl
and
the
nurse
told
me
to
ask
you
about
the
case
i
want
you
to
tell
me
about
her
about
her
why
is
she
living
in
that
wretched
place
with
those
negroes
why
did
she
attempt
to
kill
herself
i
want
to
know
about
this
girl
as
you
know
her
as
miss
farwell
knows
the
old
physician
made
no
reply
but
sat
silent
studying
the
young
man
who
paced
up
and
down
the
room
when
his
friend
did
not
speak
dan
said
again
doctor
you
must
tell
me
i
not
a
child
what
is
this
thing
that
you
should
so
hesitate
to
talk
to
me
freely
i
must
know
and
you
must
tell
me
now
i
guess
you
are
right
boy
returned
the
other
slowly
to
big
dan
born
with
the
passion
for
service
in
his
very
blood
and
reared
amid
the
simple
surroundings
of
his
mountain
home
where
the
religion
and
teaching
of
the
old
shepherd
had
been
felt
for
a
generation
where
every
soul
was
held
a
neighbor
with
a
neighbor
right
to
the
assistance
of
the
community
and
where
no
one
not
even
the
nameless
wood
colt
was
made
to
suffer
for
the
accident
of
birth
or
family
but
stood
and
was
judged
upon
his
own
life
and
living
the
story
of
grace
conner
was
a
revelation
almost
too
hideous
in
its
injustice
to
be
believed
when
the
doctor
finished
there
was
a
tense
silence
in
the
little
study
it
was
as
though
the
two
men
were
witnessing
a
grim
tragedy
trained
under
the
influence
of
his
parents
and
from
them
receiving
the
highest
ideals
of
life
and
his
duty
to
the
race
dan
had
been
drawn
irresistibly
by
the
theoretical
heroism
and
traditionally
glorious
ministry
of
the
church
now
for
the
first
time
he
was
face
to
face
with
existing
conditions
not
the
theory
but
the
practice
confronted
him
now
not
the
traditional
but
the
actual
it
was
indeed
a
tragedy
the
boy
face
was
drawn
and
white
his
eyes
wide
with
that
questioning
look
burned
with
a
light
that
his
old
friend
had
not
seen
in
them
before
the
light
of
suffering
of
agonizing
doubt
in
his
professional
duties
the
doctor
had
been
forced
to
school
himself
to
watch
the
keenest
suffering
unmoved
lest
his
emotions
bias
his
judgment
upon
the
accuracy
of
which
depended
the
life
of
his
patient
he
had
been
taught
to
cause
the
cruelest
pain
with
unshaken
nerve
by
the
fact
that
a
human
life
under
his
knife
depended
upon
the
steadiness
of
his
hand
but
his
sympathy
had
never
been
dulled
only
controlled
and
hidden
so
long
years
of
contact
with
what
might
be
called
a
disease
of
society
had
accustomed
him
to
the
sight
of
conditions
the
revelation
of
which
came
with
such
a
shock
to
the
younger
man
but
the
doctor
could
still
appreciate
what
the
revelation
meant
to
the
boy
knowing
dan
from
his
childhood
familiar
with
his
and
watching
his
growth
and
development
with
personal
loving
interest
the
old
physician
had
realized
how
singularly
susceptible
his
character
was
to
the
beautiful
beliefs
of
the
church
he
had
foreseen
too
something
of
the
suffering
when
he
should
be
brought
face
to
face
with
the
raw
naked
truths
of
life
and
dan
as
he
sat
now
searching
the
rugged
but
kindly
face
of
his
friend
realized
faintly
why
the
doctor
had
shrunk
from
talking
to
him
of
the
sick
girl
slowly
the
minister
rose
from
his
chair
aimlessly
as
one
in
perplexing
troubled
thought
he
went
to
the
window
and
standing
there
looked
out
with
unseeing
eyes
upon
the
monument
on
the
opposite
corner
of
the
street
then
he
moved
restlessly
to
the
other
window
and
with
eyes
still
unseeing
looked
down
into
the
little
garden
of
the
crippled
boy
the
garden
with
the
big
moss
and
rock
in
its
center
then
he
went
to
his
study
table
and
stood
idly
moving
the
books
and
papers
about
his
eye
mechanically
followed
the
closely
written
lines
on
the
sheets
of
paper
that
were
lying
as
he
had
left
them
that
morning
he
started
the
next
moment
with
quick
impatient
movement
he
crushed
the
pages
of
the
manuscript
in
his
powerful
hands
and
threw
them
into
the
waste
basket
he
faced
the
doctor
with
a
grim
smile
my
sermon
on
christian
ministry
chapter
xviii
to
save
a
life
it
was
not
hope
farwell
way
to
theorize
about
the
causes
of
the
wreck
or
to
speculate
as
to
the
value
of
inventions
for
making
more
efficient
the
service
when
there
was
a
definite
immediate
personal
something
to
be
done
for
the
bit
of
life
that
so
closely
touched
her
own
nurse
miss
farwell
turned
quickly
the
girl
on
the
bed
was
watching
her
with
wide
wondering
eyes
she
forced
a
smile
yes
dear
what
is
it
did
you
have
a
good
sleep
i
was
not
asleep
i
oh
nurse
is
it
true
hope
laid
a
firm
cool
hand
on
the
hot
forehead
and
looked
kindly
down
into
the
wondering
eyes
you
were
awake
while
the
minister
was
here
yes
i
i
heard
it
all
is
it
is
it
true
is
what
true
child
that
you
care
that
anyone
cares
miss
farwell
face
shone
now
with
that
as
she
lowered
her
head
until
the
sick
girl
could
see
straight
into
the
deep
gray
eyes
the
poor
creature
gazed
hungrily
breathlessly
now
do
you
know
that
i
care
whispered
the
nurse
and
the
other
burst
into
tears
grasping
the
nurse
hand
in
both
her
own
and
with
a
reviving
hope
clinging
to
it
convulsively
i
not
bad
nurse
she
sobbed
i
have
always
been
a
good
girl
even
when
when
i
was
so
hungry
but
they
they
talked
so
about
me
and
made
people
think
i
was
bad
until
i
was
ashamed
to
meet
anyone
then
they
put
me
out
of
the
church
and
nobody
would
give
me
work
in
their
homes
and
they
drove
me
away
from
every
place
i
got
until
there
was
no
place
but
this
and
i
was
so
frightened
here
alone
with
all
these
negroes
in
the
house
oh
nurse
i
did
want
to
do
it
i
did
want
to
do
it
but
i
thought
no
one
cared
no
one
they
did
not
mean
to
be
cruel
dear
said
the
nurse
softly
they
did
not
understand
you
heard
the
minister
say
they
would
help
you
now
the
girl
gripped
miss
farwell
hand
with
a
shudder
they
put
me
out
of
the
church
do
let
them
come
do
promise
me
you
wo
let
them
in
the
other
calmed
her
there
there
dear
i
will
take
care
of
you
and
no
one
can
put
you
away
from
god
you
must
remember
that
is
there
a
god
do
you
think
whispered
the
girl
yes
yes
dear
all
the
cruelty
in
the
world
ca
take
god
away
from
us
if
we
hold
on
we
all
make
mistakes
you
know
dear
terrible
mistakes
sometimes
people
with
the
kindest
truest
hearts
sometimes
do
cruel
things
without
thinking
why
i
suppose
those
who
crucified
jesus
were
kind
and
good
in
their
way
only
they
did
understand
what
they
were
doing
you
see
you
will
learn
to
feel
sorry
for
these
people
just
as
jesus
wept
over
those
who
he
knew
were
going
to
torture
and
kill
him
but
first
you
must
get
well
and
strong
again
you
will
now
you
dear
and
the
whispered
answer
came
yes
nurse
i
try
now
that
i
know
you
care
so
the
strong
young
woman
with
the
face
of
the
mother
mary
talked
to
the
poor
outcast
girl
helping
her
to
forget
turning
her
thoughts
from
the
sadness
and
bitterness
of
her
experience
to
the
gladness
and
beauty
of
a
possible
future
until
when
the
sun
lighted
up
the
windows
on
the
other
side
of
the
square
with
flaming
fire
and
all
the
sky
was
filled
with
the
glory
of
his
going
the
sick
girl
slept
clinging
still
to
her
nurse
hand
in
the
twilight
miss
farwell
sat
in
earnest
thought
deeply
religious
as
all
true
workers
must
be
she
sought
to
know
her
part
in
the
coming
scenes
of
the
drama
in
which
she
found
herself
cast
the
young
woman
felt
that
she
must
leave
corinth
her
experience
with
dan
had
made
the
place
unbearable
to
her
and
since
the
scene
that
afternoon
she
felt
more
than
ever
that
she
should
go
she
had
no
friends
in
corinth
save
her
patient
at
judge
strong
strong
the
two
doctors
deborah
and
denny
at
home
she
had
many
friends
then
from
the
standpoint
of
her
profession
and
hope
farwell
loved
her
profession
her
opportunities
in
the
city
with
dr
miles
were
too
great
to
be
lightly
thrown
aside
but
what
of
the
girl
this
girl
so
helpless
so
alone
who
buffeted
and
bruised
had
been
tossed
senseless
at
her
very
feet
by
the
wild
storms
of
life
miss
farwell
knew
the
fury
of
the
storm
she
had
witnessed
before
the
awful
strength
of
those
forces
that
overwhelmed
grace
conner
she
knew
too
that
there
were
many
others
struggling
hopelessly
in
the
pitiless
grasp
of
circumstances
beyond
their
strength
single
handed
to
overcome
as
one
watching
a
distant
wreck
from
a
place
of
safety
on
shore
the
nurse
grieved
deeply
at
the
relentless
cruelty
of
these
ungoverned
forces
and
mourned
at
her
own
powerlessness
to
check
them
but
she
felt
especially
responsible
for
this
poor
creature
who
had
been
cast
within
her
reach
here
was
work
to
her
hand
this
she
could
do
and
it
must
be
done
now
without
hesitation
or
delay
she
could
not
prevent
the
shipwrecks
she
could
perhaps
save
the
life
of
this
one
who
had
felt
the
fury
of
the
storm
it
was
not
hope
farwell
way
to
theorize
about
the
causes
of
the
wreck
or
to
speculate
as
to
the
value
of
inventions
for
making
more
efficient
the
service
when
there
was
a
definite
immediate
personal
something
to
be
done
for
the
bit
of
life
that
so
closely
touched
her
own
there
was
no
doubt
in
the
nurse
mind
now
but
that
the
girl
would
live
and
regain
her
health
but
what
then
the
people
would
see
that
she
was
cared
for
as
long
as
she
was
sick
who
among
them
would
give
her
a
place
when
she
was
no
longer
an
object
of
ostentatious
charity
her
very
attempted
suicide
would
mark
her
in
the
community
more
strongly
than
ever
and
she
would
be
met
on
every
hand
by
suspicion
distrust
and
cruel
curiosity
then
indeed
she
would
need
a
friend
someone
to
believe
in
her
and
to
love
her
of
what
use
to
save
the
life
tossed
up
by
the
storm
only
to
set
it
adrift
again
as
miss
farwell
meditated
in
the
twilight
the
conviction
grew
that
her
responsibility
could
end
only
when
the
life
was
safe
it
is
after
all
a
little
thing
to
save
a
life
it
is
a
great
thing
to
make
it
safe
indeed
in
a
larger
sense
a
life
is
never
saved
until
it
is
safe
when
harry
called
later
in
the
evening
as
he
had
promised
he
handed
the
nurse
an
envelope
matthews
asked
me
to
give
you
this
he
said
i
met
him
just
as
he
was
crossing
the
square
he
would
not
come
in
but
turned
back
toward
town
he
watched
her
curiously
as
she
broke
the
seal
and
read
the
brief
note
i
have
seen
oldham
and
he
has
told
about
your
patient
you
are
right
i
can
not
present
the
matter
to
my
people
i
thank
you
but
this
can
not
prevent
my
own
personal
ministry
please
use
the
enclosed
for
miss
conner
without
mentioning
my
name
you
must
not
deny
me
this
the
enclosed
was
a
bill
large
and
generous
miss
farwell
handed
the
letter
to
harry
with
the
briefest
explanation
possible
for
a
long
time
the
doctor
sat
in
brown
study
then
making
no
comment
further
than
asking
her
to
use
the
money
as
the
minister
had
directed
he
questioned
her
as
to
the
patient
condition
when
she
had
finished
her
report
he
drew
a
long
breath
we
are
all
right
now
nurse
she
will
get
over
this
nicely
and
in
a
week
or
two
will
be
as
good
as
ever
but
what
then
chapter
xix
on
fishing
is
not
for
you
to
waste
your
time
in
useless
speculation
as
to
the
unknowable
source
of
your
or
in
seeking
to
trace
it
in
the
ocean
it
is
enough
for
you
that
it
is
and
that
while
it
runs
its
brief
course
it
is
yours
to
make
it
yield
its
blessings
for
this
you
must
train
your
hand
and
eye
and
brain
you
must
be
in
life
a
fisherman
come
boy
said
the
doctor
at
last
laying
his
hand
upon
the
young
minister
shoulder
come
boy
let
go
fishing
i
know
a
dandy
place
about
twelve
miles
from
here
we
coax
martha
to
fix
us
up
a
bite
and
start
at
daylight
what
do
you
say
but
i
ca
cried
dan
tomorrow
is
saturday
and
i
have
nothing
now
for
sunday
morning
he
looked
toward
the
waste
basket
where
lay
his
sermon
on
the
christian
ministry
humph
grunted
the
doctor
you
find
a
better
one
when
you
get
away
from
this
older
men
than
you
dan
have
fought
this
thing
all
their
lives
do
think
that
you
can
settle
it
in
a
couple
of
days
thinking
take
time
to
fish
a
little
it
help
a
lot
there
nothing
like
a
running
stream
to
clear
one
mind
and
set
one
thoughts
going
in
fresh
channels
i
want
you
to
see
gordon
mills
come
boy
let
go
fishing
the
evening
was
spent
in
preparation
eager
anticipation
and
discussion
of
the
craft
prompted
by
the
doctor
and
as
they
overhauled
flies
and
rods
and
lines
and
reels
and
recalled
the
many
delightful
days
spent
as
they
proposed
to
spend
the
morrow
the
young
man
thoughts
were
led
away
from
the
first
real
tragedy
of
his
soul
at
daylight
after
a
breakfast
of
their
own
cooking
partly
prepared
the
night
before
by
martha
who
unquestionably
viewed
the
minister
going
away
on
a
saturday
with
doubtful
eyes
they
were
off
when
they
left
the
town
far
behind
and
following
the
ridge
road
in
the
clear
air
of
the
early
day
entered
the
woods
the
doctor
laughed
aloud
as
dan
burst
forth
with
a
wild
boyish
yell
i
could
help
it
doctor
it
did
itself
he
said
in
half
apology
it
so
good
to
be
out
in
the
woods
with
you
again
i
feel
as
if
i
were
being
already
yell
again
said
the
physician
with
another
laugh
and
added
dryly
i
wo
tell
gordon
mills
on
gordon
creek
lay
in
a
deep
narrow
valley
shut
in
and
hidden
from
the
world
by
many
miles
of
rolling
hills
the
mill
the
general
store
and
post
office
and
the
blacksmith
shop
were
connected
with
corinth
twelve
miles
away
by
daily
stage
a
rickety
old
spring
wagon
that
carried
the
mail
and
any
chance
passenger
pure
and
clear
and
cold
the
creek
came
welling
to
the
surface
of
the
earth
from
vast
mysterious
subterranean
caverns
in
the
heart
of
the
hills
and
from
the
brim
of
its
basin
rushed
boiling
and
roaring
along
to
the
river
two
miles
distant
checked
only
by
the
dam
at
the
mill
for
a
little
way
above
the
dam
the
waters
lay
still
and
deep
with
patches
of
long
mosses
vines
and
rushes
waving
in
its
quiet
clearness
forming
shadowy
dens
for
lusty
trout
while
the
open
places
shining
fields
and
lanes
reflected
as
a
mirror
the
steep
bluff
and
the
trees
that
bent
far
over
until
their
drooping
branches
touched
the
gleaming
surface
as
the
two
friends
tramped
the
little
path
at
the
foot
of
the
bluff
or
waded
with
legs
the
tumbling
torrent
and
sent
their
flies
hither
and
yon
across
the
boiling
flood
to
be
snatched
by
the
denizens
of
the
stream
dan
felt
the
life
and
freshness
and
strength
of
god
good
world
entering
into
his
being
at
dinner
time
they
built
a
little
fire
to
make
their
coffee
and
broil
a
generous
portion
of
their
catch
then
lying
at
ease
on
the
bank
of
the
great
spring
they
talked
as
only
those
can
talk
who
get
close
enough
to
the
great
heart
of
mother
nature
to
feel
strongly
their
common
kinship
with
her
and
with
their
fellows
after
one
of
those
long
silences
that
come
so
easily
at
such
a
time
dan
tossed
a
pebble
far
out
into
the
big
pool
and
watched
it
sink
down
down
down
until
he
lost
it
in
the
unknown
depths
doctor
where
does
it
come
from
where
does
what
come
from
this
stream
you
say
its
volume
is
always
the
same
that
it
is
unaffected
by
heavy
rains
or
long
droughts
how
do
you
account
for
it
i
do
account
for
it
grunted
the
doctor
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
i
fish
in
it
dan
laughed
and
that
he
said
slowly
is
your
philosophy
of
life
the
other
made
no
answer
choosing
another
pebble
carefully
dan
said
speaking
as
a
preacher
please
elaborate
speaking
as
a
practitioner
you
try
it
returned
the
doctor
the
big
fellow
stretched
himself
out
on
his
back
with
his
hands
clasped
beneath
his
head
he
spoke
deliberately
well
you
do
not
know
from
whence
your
life
comes
and
it
goes
after
a
short
course
to
lose
itself
with
many
others
in
the
great
stream
that
reaches
at
last
and
is
lost
in
the
infinite
the
doctor
seemed
interested
dan
continued
half
talking
to
himself
it
is
not
for
you
to
waste
your
time
in
useless
speculation
as
to
the
unknowable
source
of

and

you
must
be
in
life
a
fisherman
very
well
done
murmured
the
doctor
for
a
preacher
stick
to
the
knowable
things
and
do
stick
at
the
unknowable
that
is
my
law
and
my
gospel
dan
retorted
now
let
watch
the
practitioner
make
a
cast
humph
why
do
you
stop
it
boy
stop
what
dan
sat
up
the
other
pointed
to
the
great
basin
of
water
that
though
the
stream
rushed
away
in
such
volume
and
speed
was
never
diminished
being
constantly
renewed
from
its
invisible
unknown
source
the
young
man
shook
his
head
awed
by
the
contemplation
of
the
mighty
hidden
power
and
the
doctor
poet
now
said
no
more
can
the
great
stream
of
love
that
is
in
the
race
for
the
race
and
that
finds
expression
in
sympathy
and
service
be
finally
stopped
fed
by
hidden
eternal
sources
it
will
somehow
find
its
way
to
the
surface
checked
and
hampered
for
the
moment
by
obstacles
of
circumstances
or
conditions
it
is
not
stopped
for
no
circumstance
can
touch
the
source
and
love
will
keep
coming
breaking
down
or
rising
over
the
barrier
it
may
be
cutting
for
itself
new
channels
if
need
be
for
every
judge
strong
and
his
kind
there
is
a
hope
farwell
and
her
kind
for
every
ecclesiastical
dogma
there
is
a
living
growing
truth
dan
sermon
the
next
day
given
in
place
of
the
one
announced
did
not
please
the
whole
of
his
people
it
was
all
very
fine
and
sounded
very
pretty
said
martha
but
i
would
like
to
know
brother
matthews
where
does
the
church
come
in
chapter
xx
common
ground
we
will
find
common
ground
he
exclaimed
here
we
have
already
found
it
this
garden
denny
garden
the
following
tuesday
morning
dan
was
at
work
bright
and
early
in
garden
many
of
the
good
members
of
memorial
church
would
have
said
that
dan
might
better
have
been
at
work
in
his
study
the
ruling
classes
in
this
congregation
that
theoretically
had
no
ruling
classes
were
beginning
to
hint
among
themselves
of
a
humiliation
beyond
expression
at
the
spectacle
now
becoming
so
common
of
their
minister
working
with
his
coat
off
like
an
ordinary
laboring
man
he
should
have
more
respect
for
the
dignity
of
the
cloth
at
least
if
he
had
no
pride
of
his
own
he
should
have
more
regard
for
the
feelings
of
his
membership
besides
this
they
did
not
pay
him
to
work
in
garden
the
grave
and
watchful
keepers
of
the
faith
who
held
themselves
responsible
to
the
god
they
thought
they
worshiped
for
the
belief
of
the
man
they
had
employed
to
prove
to
the
world
wherein
it
was
all
wrong
and
they
were
all
right
watched
their
minister
growing
interest
in
this
catholic
family
with
increasing
uneasiness
the
rest
of
the
church
who
were
neither
of
the
class
nor
of
the
keepers
but
merely
passengers
as
it
were
in
the
ark
of
salvation
looked
on
with
puzzled
interest
it
was
a
new
move
in
the
game
that
added
a
spice
of
ginger
to
the
play
not
wholly
distasteful
from
a
safe
distance
the
passengers
kept
one
eye
on
the
class
and
the
other
on
the
keepers
with
occasionally
a
stolen
glance
at
dan
and
waited
nervously
for
their
cue
the
world
outside
the
fold
awaited
developments
with
amused
and
breathless
interest
everybody
secretly
admired
the
stalwart
young
worker
in
the
garden
and
the
entire
community
was
grateful
that
he
had
given
them
something
new
to
talk
about
memorial
church
was
filled
at
every
service
meanwhile
wholly
unconscious
of
all
this
big
dan
continued
digging
his
way
among
the
potatoes
helping
the
crippled
boy
to
harvest
and
prepare
for
market
the
cabbages
and
other
vegetables
that
grew
in
the
plot
of
ground
under
his
study
window
never
dreaming
that
there
was
aught
of
interest
either
to
church
or
town
in
the
simple
neighborly
kindness
it
is
a
fact
though
dan
at
this
time
would
not
have
admitted
it
even
to
himself
that
the
hours
spent
in
the
garden
with
denny
enthroned
upon
the
big
rock
and
deborah
calling
an
occasional
cheery
word
from
the
cottage
were
by
far
the
most
pleasant
hours
of
the
day
every
nerve
and
muscle
in
the
splendid
body
of
this
young
giant
of
the
hills
called
for
action
the
one
mastering
passion
of
his
soul
was
the
passion
for
deeds
to
do
to
serve
to
be
used
he
had
felt
himself
called
to
the
ministry
by
his
desire
to
accomplish
a
work
that
would
be
of
real
worth
to
the
world
he
was
already
conscious
of
being
somewhat
out
of
place
with
the
regular
work
of
the
church
the
pastoral
calls
which
mean
visiting
day
after
day
in
the
homes
of
the
members
to
talk
with
the
women
about
nothing
at
all
at
hours
when
the
men
of
the
household
are
away
laboring
with
brain
or
hand
for
the
necessities
of
life
the
meetings
of
the
various
women
societies
where
the
minister
himself
is
the
only
man
present
and
the
talk
is
all
women
talk
the
committee
meetings
where
hours
are
spent
in
discussing
the
most
trivial
matters
with
the
most
ponderous
gravity
as
though
the
salvation
of
the
world
depends
upon
the
color
of
the
pulpit
carpet
or
who
should
bake
a
cake
for
the
next
social
for
nearly
a
week
now
dan
had
found
no
time
to
touch
the
garden
he
was
resolved
this
day
to
make
good
his
neglect
an
hour
before
denny
was
up
the
minister
was
ready
for
his
work
as
he
went
to
get
the
from
the
little
woodshed
deborah
called
from
the
kitchen
is
airly
ye
are
this
mornin
sir
it
not
many
that
do
be
layin
awake
all
the
night
waitin
for
the
first
crack
o
day
so
they
can
get
up
to
somebody
else
work
fer
thim
the
minister
laughingly
dodged
the
expressions
of
gratitude
he
saw
coming
i
been
shirking
lately
he
said
if
i
do
do
better
than
this
the
boss
will
be
firing
me
sure
how
is
he
fine
sir
fine
he
not
up
yet
you
hear
him
yelling
at
you
as
soon
as
he
sees
what
you
at
good
ejaculated
the
other
i
get
ahead
of
him
this
time
perhaps
i
can
get
such
a
start
before
he
turns
out
that
he
let
me
stay
a
while
longer
as
it
would
not
be
pleasant
to
get
my
discharge
passing
laborers
and
business
men
on
the
way
to
their
daily
tasks
smiled
at
the
coatless
figure
in
the
garden
several
called
a
pleasant
greeting
the
boy
with
the
morning
papers
from
the
great
city
checked
his
whistle
as
he
looked
curiously
over
the
fence
and
the
doctor
who
came
out
on
the
porch
looked
across
the
street
to
the
busy
gardener
and
grunted
with
satisfaction
as
he
turned
to
his
roses
but
dan
mind
was
not
occupied
altogether
that
morning
by
the
work
upon
which
his
hands
were
engaged
neither
was
he
thinking
only
of
his
church
duties
or
planning
sermons
for
the
future
as
he
bent
to
his
homely
tasks
his
thoughts
strayed
continually
to
the
young
woman
whom
he
had
last
seen
beside
the
bed
of
the
sick
girl
in
the
room
in
old
town
the
beautiful
freshness
and
sweetness
of
the
morning
and
the
perfume
of
the
dewy
things
seemed
subtly
to
suggest
her
thoughts
of
her
seemed
somehow
to
fit
in
with
gardening
he
recalled
every
time
he
had
met
her
the
times
had
not
been
many
and
they
were
still
strangers
but
every
occasion
had
been
marked
by
something
that
seemed
to
fix
it
as
unusual
making
their
meeting
seem
far
from
commonplace
he
still
had
that
feeling
that
she
was
to
play
a
large
part
in
his
life
and
he
was
confident
that
they
would
meet
again
he
was
wondering
where
and
how
when
he
looked
up
from
his
work
to
see
her
coming
toward
him
dressed
in
a
fresh
uniform
of
blue
and
white
the
young
fellow
stood
speechless
with
wonder
as
she
came
on
picking
her
way
daintily
among
the
beds
and
rows
her
skirts
held
carefully
her
beautiful
figure
expressing
health
and
strength
and
joyous
tingling
life
in
every
womanly
curve
and
line
there
was
something
wonderfully
intimate
and
sweetly
suggestive
in
the
picture
they
made
that
morning
these
two
the
strong
young
woman
in
her
uniform
of
service
going
in
the
glow
of
the
early
day
to
the
stalwart
coatless
man
in
the
garden
to
interrupt
him
in
his
homely
labor
good
morning
she
said
with
a
smile
i
have
been
watching
you
from
the
house
and
decided
that
you
were
working
altogether
too
industriously
and
needed
a
breathing
spell
do
you
do
everything
so
energetically
it
is
sadly
true
of
most
men
today
that
the
more
you
cover
them
up
the
better
they
look
our
civilization
demands
a
coat
and
the
rule
seems
to
be
the
more
civilization
the
more
coat
dan
matthews
is
one
of
those
rare
men
who
look
well
in
his
shirt
sleeves
his
shoulders
and
body
needed
no
shaped
and
padded
garments
to
set
them
off
the
young
eyes
in
spite
of
her
calm
betrayed
her
admiration
as
he
stood
before
her
so
tall
and
straight
his
powerful
shoulders
deep
chest
and
great
muscled
arms
so
clearly
revealed
but
dan
did
not
see
the
admiration
in
her
eyes
he
was
so
bewildered
by
the
mere
fact
of
her
presence
that
he
failed
to
note
this
interesting
detail
he
looked
toward
the
house
then
back
to
the
young
woman
face
you
were
watching
me
from
the
house
he
repeated
really
i
did
not
know
that
you
were
your
neighbors
she
finished
yes
we
are
grace
and
i
moved
yesterday
you
see
she
continued
eager
to
explain
it
was
not
good
for
her
to
remain
in
that
place
it
was
all
so
suggestive
of
her
suffering
i
knew
that
mulhall
had
a
room
for
rent
because
i
had
planned
to
take
it
before
i
decided
to
go
back
to
chicago
she
blushed
as
she
recalled
the
thoughts
that
had
led
her
to
the
decision
but
went
on
resolutely
the
poor
child
has
such
a
fear
of
everybody
that
i
thought
it
would
help
her
to
know
that
mulhall
and
denny
could
be
good
to
her
even
though
it
was
denny
father
that
her
father
you
know
dan
eyes
were
shining
yes
i
know
he
said
i
explained
to
mulhall
and
like
the
dear
good
soul
she
is
she
understood
at
once
and
made
the
poor
child
feel
better
right
away
i
thought
too
that
if
grace
were
living
here
with
mulhall
it
might
help
the
people
to
be
kinder
to
her
then
someone
will
give
her
a
chance
to
earn
her
living
and
she
will
be
all
right
the
people
will
soon
act
differently
when
they
see
how
mulhall
feels
do
you
think
they
will
dan
could
scarcely
find
words
she
was
so
entirely
unconscious
of
the
part
she
was
playing
of
this
beautiful
thing
she
was
doing
and
you
he
asked
you
are
not
going
away
not
until
she
gets
a
place
she
will
need
me
until
she
finds
a
home
you
know
and
harry
assures
me
there
is
plenty
of
work
for
me
in
corinth
so
grace
and
i
will
keep
house
at
mulhall
grace
will
do
the
work
while
i
am
busy
it
will
make
her
feel
less
dependent
and
she
added
frankly
it
will
not
cost
so
much
that
way
and
that
brings
me
to
what
i
came
out
here
to
say
she
paused
i
wish
to
thank
you
matthews
for
your
help
for
the
money
you
sent
the
poor
child
needed
so
many
things
and
i
want
to
beg
your
pardon
for
for
the
shameful
way
i
treated
you
when
you
called
i
i
knew
better
and
mulhall
has
been
telling
me
how
much
you
have
done
for
them
i
dan
interrupted
please
do
miss
farwell
i
understand
you
were
exactly
right
i
know
now
then
he
added
slowly
i
want
you
to
know
though
miss
farwell
that
i
had
no
thought
of
being
rude
when
we
talked
in
the
old
academy
yard
she
was
silent
and
he
went
on
i
must
make
you
understand
that
i
am
not
the
cad
that
i
seemed
i
you
know
this
ministry
he
emphasized
the
word
with
a
smile
is
so
new
to
me
i
am
really
so
inexperienced
she
glanced
at
him
quickly
he
continued
i
had
never
before
heard
such
thoughts
as
you
expressed
and
i
was
too
puzzled
to
realize
how
my
silence
would
appear
to
you
when
you
knew
then
this
is
your
first
church
she
asked
yes
he
said
and
i
am
beginning
to
realize
how
woefully
ignorant
i
am
of
life
you
know
i
was
born
and
brought
up
in
the
backwoods
until
i
went
to
college
i
knew
only
our
simple
country
life
at
college
i
knew
only
books
and
students
then
i
came
here
as
he
talked
the
young
woman
face
cleared
it
was
something
very
refreshing
to
hear
such
a
man
declare
his
ignorance
of
life
with
the
frankness
of
a
boy
she
held
out
her
hand
impulsively
let
forget
it
all
she
said
it
was
a
horrid
mistake
and
we
are
to
be
good
friends
he
asked
grasping
her
outstretched
hand
without
replying
the
young
woman
quietly
released
her
hand
and
drew
back
a
few
paces
she
was
trembling
she
fought
for
there
was
something
what
was
it
about
this
man
the
touch
of
his
hand
hope
farwell
was
frightened
by
emotions
new
and
strange
to
her
she
found
a
seat
on
the
big
rock
and
ignoring
his
question
said
so
that
why
you
are
so
big
and
strong
and
know
so
well
how
to
work
in
a
garden
i
thought
it
was
strange
for
one
of
your
calling
i
see
now
how
natural
it
is
for
you
yes
he
smiled
it
is
very
natural
more
so
than
preaching
but
tell
me
do
you
think
we
should
be
good
friends
we
are
going
to
be
now
are
we
not
the
young
woman
answered
with
quiet
dignity
friendship
matthews
means
a
great
deal
to
me
and
to
you
also
i
am
sure
friends
must
have
much
in
common
we
have
nothing
because
because
everything
that
i
said
to
you
at
the
academy
to
me
is
true
we
do
not
live
in
the
same
world
but
it
for
myself
the
man
and
not
the
minister
that
i
ask
it
he
urged
eagerly
she
watched
his
face
closely
as
she
answered
but
you
and
your
ministry
are
one
and
the
same
yourself
your
life
is
your
ministry
you
are
your
ministry
and
your
ministry
is
you
but
we
will
find
common
ground
he
exclaimed
look
here
we
have
already
found
it
this
garden
denny
garden
we
put
a
sign
over
the
gate
professional
ministry
shall
enter
here
the
preacher
lives
up
there
he
pointed
to
his
window
the
man
dan
matthews
works
in
the
garden
here
to
the
man
in
the
garden
you
may
say
what
you
like
about
the
parson
up
there
we
will
differ
of
course
but
we
may
each
gain
something
as
is
right
for
friends
for
we
will
each
grant
to
the
other
the
privilege
of
being
true
to
self
she
hesitated
then
slipping
from
the
rock
and
looking
him
full
in
the
face
said
i
warn
you
it
will
not
work
but
for
friendship
sake
we
will
try
neither
of
them
realized
the
deep
significance
of
the
terms
but
in
the
days
that
followed
the
people
of
corinth
had
much
much
more
to
talk
about
the
ally
was
well
pleased
and
saw
to
it
that
the
ladies
of
the
aid
society
were
not
long
in
deciding
that
something
must
be
done
chapter
xxi
the
warning
from
god
sunny
hillside
pastures
to
the
gloom
and
stench
of
the
slaughter
pens
it
happened
two
weeks
to
the
day
after
dan
and
miss
farwell
met
in
denny
garden
the
ally
had
been
busy
to
some
purpose
the
ladies
aid
having
reached
the
point
of
declaring
that
something
must
be
done
did
something
the
elders
of
memorial
church
in
their
official
capacity
called
on
their
pastor
dan
was
in
the
garden
when
the
elders
came
the
doctor
wife
declared
that
dan
spent
most
of
his
time
in
the
garden
now
and
that
when
there
he
did
nothing
because
that
nurse
was
always
helping
him
good
martha
has
the
fatal
gift
of
telling
a
bit
of
news
so
vividly
that
it
gains
much
in
the
telling
miss
farwell
was
in
the
garden
that
afternoon
with
the
minister
and
so
was
denny
while
grace
conner
and
deborah
were
sitting
on
the
front
porch
of
the
little
cottage
when
the
two
church
fathers
passed
though
neither
of
the
men
turned
their
heads
neither
of
them
failed
to
see
the
two
women
on
the
porch
and
the
three
friends
in
the
garden
for
the
love
of
heaven
look
there
exclaimed
deborah
in
an
excited
whisper
they
turnin
in
at
the
minister
gate
an
him
out
there
in
the
in
his
shirt
in
the
ground
an
wid
denny
an
miss
hope
i
misdoubt
there
somethin
stirrin
to
take
thim
to
his
door
the
day
i
must
run
an
give
him
the
word
but
dan
had
seen
and
was
already
on
his
way
to
the
front
gate
drawing
on
his
coat
as
he
went
from
the
other
side
of
the
street
the
doctor
waved
his
hand
to
dan
encouragingly
as
the
young
man
walked
hastily
down
the
sidewalk
to
overtake
the
church
officials
at
the
front
door
truly
in
this
denominational
hippodrome
odd
are
sometimes
set
to
run
together
the
efforts
of
the
children
of
light
to
equal
in
wisdom
the
children
of
darkness
leading
the
church
to
clap
its
ecclesiastical
harness
upon
anything
that
by
flattery
bribes
or
intimidation
can
be
led
coaxed
or
driven
to
pull
at
the
particular
congregational
chariot
to
which
the
tugs
are
fast
when
the
people
of
corinth
speak
of
judge
strong
religion
or
his
relation
to
the
memorial
church
they
wink
if
the
judge
is
not
looking
when
elder
jordan
is
mentioned
their
voices
always
have
a
note
of
respect
and
true
regard
elder
strong
is
always
called
the
judge
nathaniel
jordan
was
known
far
and
wide
as
elder
jordan
thus
does
the
community
as
communities
have
a
way
of
doing
touch
the
heart
of
the
whole
matter
dan
recognized
instinctively
the
difference
in
the
characters
of
these
two
men
yet
he
had
found
them
always
of
one
mind
in
all
matters
of
the
church
he
felt
the
subtle
antagonism
of
judge
strong
though
he
did
not
realize
that
the
reason
for
it
lay
in
the
cunning
instinct
of
a
creature
that
recognized
a
natural
enemy
in
all
such
spirits
as
his
he
felt
too
the
regard
and
growing
appreciation
of
elder
jordan
yet
the
two
churchmen
were
in
perfect
accord
in
their
brotherly
administration
when
the
officials
met
in
dan
study
that
day
their
characters
were
unmistakable
that
they
were
both
in
harness
was
also
clear
the
minister
favorite
chair
creaked
in
dismay
as
the
judge
settled
his
heavy
body
and
twisted
this
way
and
that
in
an
open
effort
to
inspect
every
corner
of
the
apartment
with
his
narrow
suspicious
eyes
while
the
older
churchman
sat
by
the
window
studiously
observing
something
outside
dan
experienced
that
strange
feeling
of
uneasiness
familiar
to
every
schoolboy
when
called
upon
unexpectedly
for
the
private
interview
with
the
teacher
the
elders
had
never
visited
him
before
it
was
too
evident
that
they
had
come
now
upon
matters
of
painful
importance
at
last
judge
strong
wandering
eye
came
to
rest
upon
dan
favorite
that
stood
in
a
corner
behind
a
the
young
face
grew
red
in
spite
of
him
it
was
impossible
not
to
feel
guilty
of
something
in
the
presence
of
judge
strong
even
elder
jordan
started
as
his
brother
official
metallic
voice
rang
out
i
see
that
you
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
the
early
disciples
in
one
thing
at
least
brother
matthews
you
go
fishing
he
gave
forth
a
shrill
cold
laugh
that
more
than
anything
else
betrayed
the
real
spirit
he
laughed
to
hide
this
remark
was
characteristic
of
judge
strong
on
the
surface
it
was
the
mild
jest
of
a
churchman
whose
mind
dwelt
so
habitually
on
the
sacred
book
that
even
in
his
lightest
vein
he
could
not
but
express
himself
in
terms
and
allusions
of
religious
significance
beneath
the
surface
his
words
carried
an
accusation
a
condemnation
a
sneer
his
manner
was
the
eager
expectant
manner
of
a
dog
that
has
treed
something
the
judge
method
was
skillfully
chosen
to
give
him
this
advantage
it
made
his
meaning
clear
while
it
gave
no
possible
opening
for
a
reply
to
the
real
idea
his
words
conveyed
and
forced
his
listener
to
an
embarrassed
silence
of
that
secured
the
judge
in
his
assumed
position
of
pious
superiority
dan
forced
a
smile
he
felt
that
the
judge
laugh
demanded
it
yes
he
said
i
am
scriptural
when
it
comes
to
fishing
oldham
and
i
had
a
fine
day
at
gordon
mills
so
i
understand
said
the
other
meaningly
i
suppose
you
and
the
old
doctor
have
some
interesting
talks
on
religion
it
was
impossible
not
to
feel
the
sneering
accusation
under
the
words
it
was
as
impossible
to
answer
again
dan
face
flushed
as
he
said
no
we
do
not
discuss
the
church
very
often
no
said
the
judge
i
should
think
you
would
find
him
a
good
subject
to
practice
on
perhaps
though
he
practices
on
you
heh
again
he
laughed
ahem
ahem
elder
jordan
gave
his
usual
warning
dan
turned
to
the
good
old
man
with
a
feeling
of
relief
at
least
nathaniel
jordan
words
would
bear
their
face
value
perhaps
brother
strong
we
had
better
tell
brother
matthews
the
object
of
our
call
the
judge
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
the
air
of
one
about
to
be
pleasantly
entertained
he
waved
his
hand
with
a
gesture
that
said
as
plainly
as
words
all
right
nathaniel
go
ahead
i
here
if
you
need
me
so
do
be
uneasy
if
you
find
yourself
unequal
to
the
task
depend
upon
me
to
help
you
out
the
minister
waited
with
an
expectant
air
ahem
ahem
you
must
not
think
brother
matthews
that
there
is
anything
really
wrong
because
we
called
but
we
ahem
we
thought
best
to
give
you
a
brotherly
warning
i
sure
you
will
take
it
in
the
spirit
in
which
it
is
meant
the
judge
stirred
uneasily
in
his
chair
bending
upon
dan
such
a
look
as
had
he
been
a
real
judge
he
might
have
cast
upon
a
convicted
criminal
dan
already
felt
guilty
he
signified
his
assent
to
the
statement
and
nathaniel
proceeded
you
are
a
young
man
brother
matthews
i
may
say
a
very
talented
young
man
and
we
are
jealous
for
your
success
in
this
community
and
ahem
for
the
standing
of
memorial
church
some
of
our
ladies
feel
i
may
say
that
we
feel
that
you
have
been
a
little
ah
careless
about
some
things
of
late
elder
strong
and
i
know
from
past
experience
that
a
preacher
a
young
unmarried
preacher
can
not
be
too
careful
not
that
we
have
the
least
idea
that
you
mean
any
harm
you
know
not
the
least
in
the
world
but
people
will
talk
and
ahem
ahem
dan
face
was
a
study
he
was
so
clearly
mystified
by
the
remarks
that
the
good
man
found
his
duty
even
more
embarrassing
than
he
had
anticipated
then
judge
strong
threw
a
flood
of
light
upon
the
situation
in
a
characteristic
manner
that
young
woman
grace
conner
has
a
mighty
bad
name
in
this
town
and
the
other
one
her
friend
the
nurse
is
a
stranger
she
was
in
my
house
for
a
month
and
well
some
things
about
her
look
mighty
queer
to
me
she
has
been
inside
a
church
since
she
came
to
corinth
i
would
be
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
cast
a
suspicion
on
anyone
but
he
finished
with
a
shake
of
his
head
and
an
expression
of
pious
doubt
on
his
crafty
face
that
said
he
could
if
he
wished
tell
many
dark
secrets
of
miss
farwell
life
dan
was
on
his
feet
instantly
his
face
flaming
and
his
eyes
gleaming
with
indignation
i
then
he
checked
himself
confused
as
in
a
flash
he
remembered
who
these
men
were
and
his
relation
to
them
in
the
church
i
beg
your
pardon
he
finished
slowly
and
dropped
back
into
his
chair
biting
his
lips
and
clenching
his
big
hands
in
an
effort
at
elder
jordan
broke
in
nervously
ahem
ahem
you
understand
brother
matthews
that
the
sisters
that
we
do
not
think
that
you
mean
any
harm
but
your
standing
in
the
community
you
know
is
such
that
we
must
shun
every
appearance
of
evil
we
ahem
we
felt
it
our
duty
to
call
big
dan
who
had
never
met
that
spirit
the
ally
knew
not
how
to
answer
his
masters
in
the
church
he
tried
to
feel
that
their
mission
to
him
was
of
grave
importance
he
was
tempted
to
laugh
their
ponderous
dignity
seemed
so
ridiculous
thank
you
sir
he
at
last
managed
to
say
gravely
i
think
it
is
hardly
necessary
for
me
to
attempt
any
explanation
he
was
still
fighting
for
and
chose
his
words
carefully
i
will
consider
this
matter
then
he
turned
the
conversation
skillfully
into
other
channels
when
the
overseers
of
the
church
were
gone
the
young
pastor
walked
the
floor
of
the
room
trying
to
grasp
the
true
significance
of
the
situation
gradually
the
real
meaning
of
the
elders
visit
grew
upon
him
because
his
own
life
was
so
big
so
broad
because
his
ideals
and
ambitions
were
so
high
so
true
to
the
spirit
of
the
christ
whose
service
he
thought
he
had
entered
he
could
not
believe
his
senses
he
might
have
found
some
shadow
of
reason
perhaps
for
their
fears
regarding
his
friendship
for
the
girl
with
the
bad
reputation
had
the
circumstances
been
other
than
they
were
and
had
he
not
known
who
it
was
gave
grace
conner
her
bad
name
but
that
his
friendship
for
miss
farwell
whose
beautiful
ministry
was
such
an
example
of
the
spirit
of
the
christian
religion
and
that
her
care
for
the
poor
girl
should
be
so
quickly
construed
into
something
evil
his
mind
positively
refused
to
entertain
the
thought
he
felt
that
the
visit
of
his
church
fathers
was
unreal
he
was
as
one
dazed
by
an
unpleasant
dream
to
come
from
the
pure
wholesome
atmosphere
of
his
home
and
the
inspiring
study
of
the
history
of
the
christian
religion
to
such
a
twisted
distorted
hideous
corruption
of
the
church
policy
and
spirit
was
to
dan
like
coming
from
god
sunny
hillside
pastures
to
the
gloom
and
stench
of
the
slaughter
pens
he
was
stunned
by
the
littleness
the
meanness
that
had
prompted
the
kindly
warning
of
these
leaders
of
the
church
slowly
he
began
to
see
what
that
spirit
might
mean
to
him
no
man
of
ordinary
intelligence
could
long
be
in
memorial
church
without
learning
that
it
was
ruled
by
a
ring
as
truly
as
any
body
politic
was
ever
so
ruled
dan
matthews
understood
too
clearly
that
his
position
in
memorial
church
depended
upon
the
bosses
then
in
control
and
he
saw
farther
saw
indeed
that
his
final
success
or
failure
in
his
chosen
calling
depended
upon
the
standing
that
should
be
given
him
by
this
his
first
charge
depended
at
the
last
upon
these
two
men
who
had
shown
themselves
each
in
his
own
way
so
easily
influenced
by
the
low
vicious
tales
of
a
few
town
gossips
as
one
in
the
dark
stepping
without
warning
into
a
boggy
hole
dan
groped
for
firmer
ground
as
one
standing
alone
in
a
wide
plain
sees
on
the
distant
horizon
the
threat
of
a
gathering
storm
and
watching
shudders
at
the
shadow
of
a
passing
cloud
dan
stood
a
feeling
of
loneliness
and
dread
heavy
upon
him
he
longed
for
companionship
for
someone
to
whom
he
could
speak
his
heart
but
to
whom
in
corinth
could
he
go
these
men
who
had
just
advised
him
were
theoretically
his
intimate
counselors
to
them
he
was
supposed
and
had
expected
to
look
in
his
inexperience
for
advice
and
help
these
men
old
in
the
service
of
the
church
how
would
they
answer
his
troubled
thoughts
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
smiled
grimly
the
doctor
he
smiled
again
dan
little
dreamed
how
much
that
keen
old
fisherman
already
knew
from
a
skillful
baiting
of
martha
about
the
visit
of
the
elders
that
afternoon
while
his
knowledge
of
dan
character
from
childhood
enabled
the
physician
to
guess
more
than
a
little
of
the
thoughts
that
occupied
the
young
man
pacing
the
floor
of
his
room
but
the
doctor
would
not
do
for
the
young
man
that
day
dan
went
to
the
window
overlooking
the
garden
the
nurse
was
still
there
helping
crippled
denny
with
his
work
the
minister
hoe
was
leaning
against
the
big
rock
as
he
had
left
it
when
he
had
caught
up
his
coat
should
he
go
down
what
would
she
say
if
he
were
to
tell
her
of
the
elders
mission
something
caused
miss
farwell
to
look
up
just
then
and
she
saw
him
she
beckoned
to
him
playfully
guardedly
like
a
schoolgirl
smiling
he
shook
his
head
he
could
not
go
more
than
ever
then
he
felt
very
much
alone
chapter
xxii
as
harry
sees
it
thus
harry
presented
another
side
of
the
problem
to
his
bewildered
friend
a
phase
of
the
question
commonly
ignored
by
every
fiery
reformer
whose
particular
reformation
is
the
one
the
only
way
the
friendship
between
dan
and
abbott
had
grown
rapidly
as
was
natural
for
the
two
men
had
much
in
common
in
a
town
as
small
as
corinth
there
are
many
opportunities
for
even
the
busiest
men
to
meet
and
scarcely
a
day
passed
that
the
doctor
and
the
preacher
did
not
exchange
greetings
at
least
as
often
as
their
duties
permitted
they
were
together
sometimes
at
the
office
or
in
dan
rooms
again
of
an
evening
at
harry
home
or
driving
miles
across
country
behind
the
bay
mare
or
big
jim
the
physician
to
see
a
patient
and
the
minister
to
be
the
hitchin
post
harry
was
just
turning
from
the
telephone
that
evening
when
dan
entered
the
house
hello
parson
he
cried
heartily
i
was
just
this
minute
trying
to
get
you
i
could
think
of
anything
to
do
to
anybody
else
so
i
thought
have
a
try
at
you
that
was
such
a
bad
guess
either
he
added
when
he
had
a
good
look
at
his
friend
face
you
evidently
need
to
have
something
fixed
what
is
it
liver
he
led
the
way
into
the
library
not
mine
said
dan
shortly
i
do
believe
i
have
one
he
pushed
an
arm
chair
to
face
the
doctor
favorite
seat
by
the
table
harry
chuckled
as
he
reached
for
his
pipe
and
tobacco
you
do
need
to
have
one
yourself
in
order
to
suffer
from
liver
troubles
speaking
professionally
my
opinion
is
that
you
preachers
as
a
class
are
more
likely
to
suffer
from
other
people
livers
than
from
your
own
though
it
is
also
true
that
the
average
parson
has
more
of
his
own
than
he
knows
what
to
do
with
and
what
do
you
doctors
prescribe
when
it
is
the
other
fellow
asked
dan
the
other
struck
a
match
oh
there
a
difference
of
opinion
in
the
profession
the
old
doctor
for
instance
pins
his
faith
to
a
split
bamboo
with
a
book
of
flies
or
a
can
of
bait
and
you
dan
was
smiling
now
the
answer
came
through
a
cloud
of
smoke
just
a
pipe
and
a
book
dan
smile
vanished
i
fear
your
treatment
would
not
agree
with
my
constitution
he
said
grimly
my
system
does
not
permit
me
to
use
the
remedy
you
prescribe
oh
i
see
you
mean
the
pipe
a
puff
of
smoke
punctuated
the
remark
the
physician
was
watching
his
friend
face
now
and
the
fun
was
gone
from
his
voice
as
he
said
gravely
pardon
me
brother
matthews
i
meant
no
slur
upon
your
personal
conviction
touching
brother
matthews
interrupted
dan
sharply
i
thought
we
had
agreed
to
drop
all
that
it
bad
enough
to
be
dodged
and
shunned
by
every
man
in
town
without
your
rubbing
it
in
as
for
my
personal
convictions
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
in
fact
my
system
does
not
permit
me
to
have
personal
convictions
harry
eyes
twinkled
this
system
of
yours
seems
to
be
in
a
bad
way
dan
what
wrong
with
it
wrong
with
it
wrong
with
my
system
man
alive
do
you
know
this
is
heresy
how
can
there
be
anything
wrong
with
my
system
does
it
relieve
me
of
any
responsibility
in
the
matter
of
right
and
wrong
does
it
take
from
me
all
such
burdens
as
personal
convictions
it
fix
my
standard
of
goodness
and
then
does
it
make
goodness
my
profession
you
poor
drudge
you
and
the
rest
of
the
merely
humans
must
be
good
as
a
matter
of
sentiment
thanks
to
my
system
my
goodness
is
a
matter
of
business
i
am
paid
for
being
good
my
system
says
that
your
pipe
and
perhaps
your
book
are
bad
sinful
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
only
obey
and
draw
my
salary
oh
well
said
harry
soothingly
there
is
the
old
doctor
remedy
it
probably
better
on
the
whole
i
tried
that
the
other
day
dan
growled
worked
did
it
dan
grinned
in
spite
of
himself
at
first
the
effects
seemed
to
be
very
beneficial
but
later
i
found
that
it
was
er
somewhat
irritating
and
that
it
slightly
aggravated
the
complaint
the
doctor
was
smiling
now
suppose
you
try
a
little
physical
exercise
occasionally
working
in
the
garden
or
dan
threw
up
his
hands
with
a
tragic
gesture
suicide
he
almost
shouted
then
they
both
lay
back
in
their
chairs
and
fairly
howled
with
laughter
whew
that
does
a
fellow
good
gasped
dan
i
guess
we
have
arrived
said
harry
with
a
final
chuckle
thought
we
were
way
off
the
track
once
or
twice
but
i
have
located
your
liver
trouble
all
right
when
did
they
call
this
afternoon
did
you
know
the
doctor
nodded
i
have
been
expecting
it
for
several
days
i
guess
you
were
about
the
only
person
in
corinth
who
was
why
did
you
tell
me
if
i
can
avoid
it
i
never
tell
a
patient
of
a
coming
operation
until
it
time
to
operate
then
it
all
over
before
they
can
get
nervous
dan
shuddered
the
laugh
was
all
out
of
him
now
i
have
certainly
been
on
the
table
this
afternoon
he
said
i
need
to
talk
it
out
with
someone
that
what
i
came
to
you
for
perhaps
you
had
better
tell
me
the
particulars
said
harry
quietly
so
dan
told
him
and
when
he
had
finished
they
had
both
grown
very
serious
i
was
afraid
of
this
dan
said
harry
you
need
to
be
very
careful
very
careful
the
other
started
to
speak
but
the
doctor
checked
him
i
know
i
know
how
you
feel
what
you
say
about
the
system
and
all
that
is
all
too
true
and
you
have
seen
the
worst
of
it
yet
by
a
good
deal
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
miss
farwell
will
be
made
to
suffer
for
her
interest
in
that
poor
girl
demanded
dan
warmly
if
miss
farwell
continues
to
live
with
grace
conner
at
mulhall
there
is
not
a
respectable
home
in
this
town
that
will
receive
her
answered
the
doctor
bluntly
my
god
are
the
people
blind
ca
the
church
see
what
a
beautiful
what
a
thing
she
is
doing
you
know
grace
conner
history
replied
harry
coolly
what
reason
is
there
to
think
it
will
be
different
in
miss
farwell
case
so
far
as
the
attitude
of
the
community
goes
dan
could
not
keep
his
seat
in
his
agitation
he
walked
the
floor
suddenly
turning
on
the
other
he
demanded
then
i
am
to
understand
that
my
friendship
with
miss
farwell
will
mean
for
me
harry
was
silent
indeed
how
could
he
suggest
ever
so
indirectly
that
the
friendship
between
dan
and
miss
farwell
should
be
discontinued
if
the
young
woman
had
been
anyone
else
or
if
harry
himself
had
not
but
why
attempt
explanation
the
minister
continued
tramping
up
and
down
the
room
stopping
now
and
then
to
face
the
doctor
who
sat
still
in
his
chair
by
the
library
table
quietly
smoking
this
is
horrible
harry
i
i
ca
believe
it
so
far
as
my
friendship
for
miss
farwell
goes
that
is
only
an
incident
it
does
not
matter
in
itself
harry
puffed
vigorously
he
thought
to
himself
that
this
might
be
true
but
something
in
dan
face
and
voice
when
he
spoke
something
of
which
he
himself
was
unconscious
made
harry
glad
that
he
had
not
answered
it
is
the
spirit
of
it
all
that
matters
the
minister
continued
pausing
again
i
never
dreamed
that
such
a
thing
could
be
that
grace
conner
life
should
be
ruined
by
the
wicked
carelessness
of
these
people
seems
bad
enough
but
that
they
should
take
the
same
attitude
toward
miss
farwell
simply
because
she
is
seeking
to
do
that
christian
thing
that
the
church
itself
will
not
do
is
is
monstrous
he
turned
impatiently
to
resume
his
restless
movement
then
when
his
friend
did
not
speak
he
continued
slowly
as
though
the
words
were
forced
from
him
against
his
will
and
to
think
that
they
could
be
so
unmoved
by
the
suffering
of
that
poor
girl
their
own
victim
and
so
untouched
by
the
example
of
miss
farwell
and
then
that
they
should
give
such
grave
consideration
and
be
so
influenced
by
absolutely
groundless
and
vicious
idle
gossip
and
that
the
church
of
christ
that
christianity
itself
should
be
so
wholly
in
the
hands
of
people
so
unspeakably
blind
so
contemptibly
mean
and
small
in
their
conceptions
of
the
religion
of
jesus
christ
he
confronted
the
doctor
again
and
his
face
flushed
why
doctor
my
whole
career
as
a
christian
minister
depends
upon
the
mere
whim
of
these
people
who
are
moved
by
such
a
spirit
as
this
no
matter
what
motives
may
prompt
my
course
they
have
the
power
to
prevent
me
from
doing
my
work
this
is
one
of
the
strongest
and
most
influential
churches
in
the
brotherhood
they
can
give
me
such
a
name
that
my
will
be
ruined
what
can
i
do
you
must
be
very
careful
dan
said
harry
slowly
careful
and
that
means
i
suppose
that
i
must
bow
to
the
people
of
this
church
ruled
as
they
are
by
such
a
spirit
as
to
my
lords
and
masters
that
i
shall
have
no
other
god
but
this
congregation
that
i
shall
deny
my
own
conscience
for
theirs
that
i
shall
go
about
the
trivial
nonsensical
things
they
call
my
pastoral
duties
in
fear
and
trembling
that
my
ministry
is
to
cringe
when
they
speak
and
do
their
will
regardless
of
what
i
feel
to
be
the
will
of
christ
faugh
big
dan
drew
himself
erect
if
this
is
what
the
call
to
the
ministry
means
i
am
beginning
to
understand
some
things
that
have
always
puzzled
me
greatly
he
dropped
wearily
into
his
chair
tell
me
doctor
he
demanded
do
the
people
generally
see
these
things
it
seems
to
me
that
everyone
who
thinks
must
see
them
replied
the
other
then
why
did
no
one
tell
me
why
did
not
the
old
doctor
explain
the
real
condition
of
the
church
as
a
rule
it
is
not
a
safe
thing
to
attempt
to
tell
a
minister
these
things
would
you
have
listened
dan
if
he
had
tried
to
tell
you
or
because
he
is
not
a
church
man
would
you
not
have
misunderstood
his
motives
the
doctor
loves
you
dan
but
you
are
a
church
man
a
member
of
the
official
board
of
my
congregation
if
men
like
you
know
these
things
why
are
you
in
the
church
at
all
silently
harry
and
lighted
his
pipe
it
was
as
if
he
deliberated
over
his
reply
the
membership
of
every
church
may
be
divided
into
three
distinct
classes
those
who
are
the
church
those
who
belong
to
the
church
and
those
who
are
members
but
who
neither
are
nor
belong
to
harry
was
a
member
dan
said
the
physician
i
suppose
it
is
very
difficult
for
such
men
as
you
to
understand
the
religious
dependence
of
people
like
myself
we
see
the
church
lack
of
appreciation
of
true
worth
of
character
we
know
the
vulgar
petty
scheming
and
for
place
the
senseless
craving
for
notoriety
and
the
prostitution
of
the
spirit
of
teaching
to
denominational
ends
we
understand
how
the
ministers
are
at
the
mercy
of
the
lowest
minds
and
the
meanest
spirits
in
their
congregation
but
dan
because
we
love
the
cause
we
do
not
talk
of
these
things
even
to
each
other
for
fear
of
being
misunderstood
it
is
useless
to
talk
of
them
to
our
ministers
for
they
dare
not
listen
why
man
i
never
in
my
life
felt
that
i
could
talk
to
my
pastor
as
i
am
talking
to
you
he
smiled
i
guess
that
i
was
afraid
that
they
would
tell
judge
strong
and
that
the
church
would
put
me
out
and
with
most
of
them
that
probably
is
exactly
what
would
have
happened
i
am
not
sure
but
you
will
consider
me
unsafe
and
avoid
me
in
the
future
he
added
whimsically
dan
smiled
at
his
words
though
they
revealed
so
much
to
him
harry
went
on
we
remain
in
the
church
and
give
it
our
support
i
suppose
because
we
are
dependent
upon
it
for
our
religious
life
because
we
know
no
religious
life
outside
of
it
it
is
the
only
institution
that
professes
to
be
distinctively
christian
and
we
love
its
teaching
in
spite
of
its
practice
we
are
always
hoping
that
some
one
will
show
us
a
way
out
and
some
one
will
he
spoke
passionately
now
with
deep
conviction
some
one
must
this
godless
mockery
can
not
continue
i
have
too
much
faith
in
the
goodness
of
men
to
believe
otherwise
i
do
know
how
the
change
will
come
but
it
will
come
and
it
will
come
from
men
in
the
church
men
like
you
dan
who
come
to
the
ministry
with
the
highest
ideals
but
you
must
be
careful
mighty
careful
not
for
your
own
sake
alone
but
for
the
sake
of
the
cause
we
both
love
some
operations
are
exceedingly
dangerous
to
the
life
of
the
patient
some
medicines
must
be
administered
with
care
lest
they
kill
instead
of
cure
men
like
me
from
long
experience
with
professional
reformers
look
with
distrust
upon
the
preacher
who
talks
about
his
church
even
while
we
know
that
there
is
a
great
need
thus
harry
presented
another
side
of
the
problem
to
his
bewildered
friend
a
phase
of
the
question
commonly
ignored
by
every
fiery
reformer
whose
particular
reformation
is
one
the
only
way
later
dan
asked
do
you
think
miss
farwell
understands
what
her
course
means
doctor
harry
shook
his
head
i
wish
i
knew
how
much
she
understands
already
two
or
three
people
who
expected
to
call
her
have
told
me
they
would
find
someone
else
i
have
several
cases
now
that
need
a
trained
nurse
but
they
wo
have
her
because
of
what
they
have
heard
and
yet
i
promised
her
you
know
that
she
should
have
plenty
of
work
have
you
told
her
this
asked
dan
again
harry
shook
his
head
what
the
good
but
she
ought
to
be
told
exclaimed
the
other
i
know
that
dan
but
i
ca
do
it
after
urging
her
as
i
did
to
stay
in
corinth
you
are
the
one
to
tell
her
i
am
sure
then
as
if
to
avoid
any
further
discussion
of
the
matter
he
rose
you
certainly
have
had
enough
of
this
for
today
old
man
i
think
prescribe
a
little
music
now
and
if
you
do
mind
i
take
some
of
my
own
prescription
i
feel
the
need
he
went
to
his
piano
and
for
an
hour
dan
was
under
the
spell
when
the
last
sweet
harmony
had
slipped
softly
away
into
the
night
the
musician
sat
still
his
head
bowed
dan
went
quietly
to
his
side
and
laid
a
hand
on
the
doctor
shoulder
amen
he
said
reverently
it
is
a
wonderful
beautiful
ministry
doctor
you
have
given
me
faith
and
hope
and
peace
thank
you
when
his
friend
had
gone
harry
went
back
to
the
piano
softly
smoothly
his
fingers
moved
over
the
ivory
keys
he
had
played
for
dan
he
played
now
for
himself
into
the
music
he
put
all
that
he
dared
not
put
into
words
all
the
longing
all
the
pain
all
the
surrender
all
the
sacrifice
were
there
for
again
when
the
minister
had
spoken
of
miss
farwell
the
doctor
had
seen
in
his
friend
face
and
heard
in
his
voice
that
which
dan
himself
did
not
yet
recognize
and
harry
had
spoken
the
conviction
of
his
heart
when
he
said
you
are
the
one
to
tell
her
i
am
sure
of
this
man
too
it
might
be
written
he
saved
others
himself
he
could
not
save
chapter
xxiii
a
parable
do
you
think
grace
that
anything
in
all
this
beautiful
world
is
of
greater
importance
of
more
value
to
the
world
than
a
human
life
with
all
its
marvelous
power
to
think
and
feel
and
love
and
hate
and
so
leave
its
mark
on
all
life
for
all
time
miss
farwell
the
nurse
looked
up
from
her
sewing
in
her
hands
what
is
it
grace
i
i
think
i
will
try
to
find
a
place
today
mulhall
told
me
last
night
that
she
had
heard
of
two
women
who
want
help
it
may
be
that
one
of
them
will
take
me
i
think
i
ought
to
try
this
was
the
third
time
within
a
few
days
that
the
girl
had
expressed
thoughts
similar
to
these
under
the
personal
care
of
miss
farwell
she
had
rapidly
recovered
from
her
terrible
experience
both
physically
and
mentally
but
the
nurse
felt
that
she
was
not
yet
strong
enough
to
meet
a
possible
rebuff
from
the
community
that
before
had
shown
itself
so
reluctant
to
treat
her
with
any
degree
whatever
of
consideration
or
kindness
the
girl
spirit
had
been
cruelly
hurt
she
was
possessed
of
an
unhealthy
morbid
fear
of
the
world
that
would
cripple
her
for
life
if
it
could
not
somehow
be
overcome
miss
farwell
felt
that
grace
conner
only
chance
lay
in
winning
a
place
for
herself
in
the
community
where
she
had
suffered
such
but
before
she
faced
the
people
again
she
must
be
prepared
the
sensitive
wounded
spirit
must
be
strengthened
for
it
could
not
bear
many
more
blows
how
to
do
this
was
the
problem
hope
dropped
her
sewing
in
her
lap
come
over
here
by
the
window
dear
and
let
talk
about
it
the
young
woman
seated
herself
on
a
stool
at
the
feet
of
her
companion
who
in
actual
years
was
but
little
her
senior
but
who
in
so
many
ways
was
to
her
an
elder
sister
why
are
you
so
anxious
to
leave
me
grace
asked
the
nurse
with
a
smile
the
girl
eyes
eyes
that
would
never
now
be
wholly
free
from
that
shadow
of
fear
and
pain
filled
with
tears
she
put
out
a
hand
impulsively
touching
miss
farwell
knee
oh
do
say
that
she
exclaimed
with
a
little
catch
in
her
voice
you
know
it
is
that
the
eyes
of
the
stronger
woman
looked
reassuringly
down
at
her
well
what
is
it
then
the
low
tone
was
insistent
the
nurse
felt
that
it
would
be
better
for
the
patient
to
express
that
which
was
in
her
own
mind
the
girl
face
was
and
she
picked
nervously
at
the
fold
of
her
friend
skirt
it
nothing
miss
farwell
only
i
feel
that
i
i
ought
not
to
be
a
burden
upon
you
a
moment
longer
than
i
can
help
i
thought
that
was
it
returned
the
other
her
firm
white
hand
slipped
under
the
trembling
chin
and
the
girl
face
was
gently
lifted
until
grace
was
forced
to
look
straight
into
those
deep
gray
eyes
tell
me
dear
why
do
you
feel
that
you
are
a
burden
upon
me
silence
for
a
moment
then
and
there
was
a
wondering
gladness
in
the
girl
voice
i
i
do
know
the
nurse
smiled
but
there
was
a
grave
note
in
her
voice
as
she
said
still
holding
the
girl
face
toward
her
own
i
tell
you
why
it
is
because
you
have
been
hurt
so
deeply
this
feeling
is
one
of
the
scars
of
your
experience
dear
all
your
life
you
will
need
to
fight
that
feeling
the
feeling
that
you
are
not
wanted
and
you
must
fight
it
fight
it
with
all
your
might
you
will
never
overcome
it
entirely
for
the
scar
of
your
hurt
is
there
to
stay
you
will
always
suffer
at
times
from
the
old
fear
but
if
you
will
you
can
conquer
it
so
far
that
it
will
not
spoil
your
life
you
must
for
your
own
sake
and
for
my
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
the
wounded
lives
you
are
going
to
help
heal
help
all
the
better
because
of
your
own
hurt
do
you
understand
dear
the
other
nodded
she
could
not
speak
you
are
going
out
into
the
world
to
find
a
place
for
yourself
of
course
for
that
is
right
hope
continued
and
it
will
be
best
for
you
to
find
a
place
here
in
corinth
if
possible
but
it
is
not
going
to
be
easy
grace
it
going
to
be
hard
very
hard
and
you
will
need
to
know
that
no
matter
what
other
people
make
you
feel
you
have
a
place
in
my
life
a
place
where
you
belong
let
me
try
if
i
can
to
tell
you
so
that
you
will
never
never
forget
for
a
little
the
nurse
looked
away
out
of
the
window
up
into
the
leafy
depths
of
the
big
trees
and
into
the
blue
sky
beyond
while
the
girl
watched
her
with
a
look
that
was
pathetic
in
its
wondering
hungering
earnestness
when
miss
farwell
spoke
again
she
chose
her
words
carefully
once
upon
a
time
a
woman
walking
in
the
mountains
discovered
by
chance
a
wonderful
mine
of
such
vast
wealth
that
there
was
nothing
in
all
the
world
like
it
for
richness
and
the
mine
belonged
to
the
woman
because
she
found
it
but
the
wealth
of
the
mine
went
out
into
the
world
for
all
men
to
use
and
thus
in
the
largest
sense
the
riches
the
woman
found
belonged
to
all
mankind
but
still
because
she
had
found
it
the
woman
always
felt
that
it
was
hers
and
so
through
her
discovery
of
this
vast
wealth
and
the
great
happiness
it
brought
to
the
world
the
mine
became
to
the
woman
the
dearest
of
all
her
possessions
tell
me
grace
do
you
think
that
anyone
could
ever
replace
the
mountains
the
ocean
or
the
stars
or
any
of
these
wonderful
wonderful
things
in
the
great
universe
if
they
were
to
be
destroyed
no
the
answer
came
in
a
puzzled
tone
and
do
you
think
grace
that
anything
in
all
this
beautiful
world
is
of
greater
importance
of
more
value
to
the
world
than
a
human
life
with
all
its
marvelous
power
to
think
and
feel
and
love
and
hate
and
so
leave
its
mark
on
all
life
for
all
time
no
miss
farwell
then
do
you
see
how
impossible
it
is
that
anyone
should
ever
take
your
place
do
you
see
that
you
have
a
place
in
the
world
a
place
that
is
yours
because
god
put
you
in
it
just
as
truly
as
he
put
the
mountains
the
seas
the
stars
in
their
places
and
do
you
see
why
you
must
feel
that
you
have
a
right
to
your
own
and
that
you
must
hold
it
no
matter
what
others
say
or
do
or
think
because
of
its
great
value
to
god
and
to
the
world
and
grace
look
at
me
child
do
you
think
that
anything
in
all
the
universe
is
dearer
to
the
father
than
a
human
life
that
is
so
wonderful
and
so
eternal
in
its
power
so
life
should
be
the
dearest
thing
in
all
the
world
to
us
not
just
the
life
of
each
to
himself
but
every
life
any
life
the
dearest
thing
to
all
i
think
this
was
true
of
christ
i
think
it
should
be
true
of
christians
i
believe
this
with
all
my
heart
there
was
silence
for
a
little
while
then
hope
said
again
now
tell
me
grace
ought
the
mine
to
have
felt
dependent
upon
the
woman
who
found
it
and
who
valued
it
so
highly
do
you
think
then
why
should
you
feel
dependent
upon
me
why
you
belong
to
me
child
your
life
the
most
wonderful
the
dearest
thing
in
all
the
world
belongs
to
me
just
as
the
mine
belonged
to
the
woman
and
brought
her
great
joy
because
it
blessed
the
world
when
others
threw
your
life
aside
when
you
yourself
tried
to
throw
it
away
i
found
it
i
took
it
it
is
mine
and
it
is
the
dearest
thing
in
all
the
world
to
me
because
it
is
so
great
a
thing
because
no
other
life
can
take
its
place
and
because
it
is
of
such
great
worth
to
the
world
do
you
see
the
calm
voice
was
vibrant
now
with
deep
emotion
looking
into
those
gray
eyes
that
shone
with
such
loving
kindness
into
her
own
grace
conner
realized
a
mighty
truth
a
truth
that
would
mould
and
shape
her
own
life
into
a
life
of
beauty
and
power
so
dear
the
nurse
continued
when
you
go
out
into
the
world
again
and
people
make
you
feel
the
old
hurt
as
they
will
you
must
remember
the
woman
who
found
the
mine
and
feeling
that
you
belong
to
me
and
to
all
life
you
will
not
let
people
rob
you
of
your
place
in
the
world
you
will
not
let
them
rob
me
of
my
great
wealth
and
now
you
must
try
the
very
best
you
can
to
get
work
here
in
corinth
but
if
you
should
fail
to
find
it
you
wo
let
that
matter
too
much
you
keep
your
place
right
here
with
me
just
the
same
wo
you
grace
because
you
are
my
mine
you
know
long
and
earnestly
the
girl
looked
into
the
face
of
the
nurse
and
miss
farwell
understood
what
the
other
could
not
say
suddenly
the
girl
caught
her
friend
hand
and
kissed
it
passionately
then
rushed
from
the
room
miss
farwell
wisely
let
her
go
without
a
word
but
her
own
eyes
were
full
she
turned
to
the
open
window
to
see
her
neighbor
the
minister
coming
in
at
the
gate

deborah
was
in
the
rear
of
the
house
busily
engaged
with
a
big
washing
denny
had
gone
up
town
on
some
errand
much
to
miss
farwell
surprise
dan
did
not
as
usual
take
the
path
leading
to
the
garden
but
kept
straight
ahead
to
the
porch
and
his
face
was
very
grave
as
he
asked
if
he
might
come
in
she
welcomed
him
with
frank
pleasure
and
took
up
at
once
the
thread
of
conversation
which
the
visit
of
the
elders
had
interrupted
the
day
before
but
it
was
clear
that
her
big
friend
mind
was
busy
with
other
thoughts
and
soon
they
were
facing
an
embarrassing
silence
the
young
woman
gazed
thoughtfully
at
the
monument
across
the
street
while
dan
moved
uneasily
at
last
the
man
broke
the
silence
miss
farwell
i
do
know
what
you
will
think
of
me
for
coming
to
you
upon
the
errand
that
brought
me
but
i
feel
that
i
i
mean
i
want
you
to
believe
that
i
am
trying
to
do
what
is
best
she
looked
at
him
questioningly
dan
went
on
i
learned
something
yesterday
that
i
am
sure
you
ought
to
know
and
there
seems
to
be
no
one
else
to
tell
you
so
i
i
came
miss
farwell
cheeks
and
brow
grew
crimson
but
in
a
moment
she
was
her
own
calm
self
again
go
on
please
then
he
told
her
while
he
was
speaking
of
the
elders
visit
and
his
talk
with
abbott
she
watched
him
closely
two
or
three
times
she
smiled
when
he
had
finished
she
asked
with
a
touch
of
sarcasm
in
her
voice
and
do
you
wish
to
see
my
letters
of
recommendation
shall
i
give
you
a
list
of
people
to
whom
you
might
write
miss
farwell
dan
voice
brought
the
hot
color
again
to
her
cheek
forgive
me
that
was
unkind
she
said
well
rather
you
might
see
that
i
did
not
come
to
you
with
this
for
well
for
fun
he
finished
with
a
grim
smile
you
do
seem
to
be
enjoying
it
greatly
she
agreed
critically
i
can
easily
understand
how
this
talk
might
result
in
something
very
serious
for
you
you
will
remember
i
think
that
i
warned
you
you
could
not
leave
the
preacher
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
she
was
deliberately
trying
him
but
of
course
you
can
easily
avoid
any
trouble
with
your
people
you
have
only
to
she
stopped
checked
by
the
expression
on
his
face
his
voice
rang
out
sharply
with
a
quality
in
its
tone
that
sent
a
thrill
to
the
heart
of
the
woman
i
did
not
come
here
to
discuss
the
possibility
of
trouble
for
me
please
believe
this
even
if
i
am
a
servant
of
the
church
he
spoke
the
last
words
with
a
shade
of
bitterness
she
thought
and
as
she
looked
at
him
his
powerful
form
tense
for
a
moment
with
lips
and
square
jaw
and
stern
eyes
she
found
herself
wondering
what
would
happen
if
this
servant
should
ever
decide
to
be
the
master
do
you
see
how
this
idle
silly
wicked
talk
is
likely
to
harm
you
he
asked
almost
roughly
you
know
what
the
same
thing
did
for
grace
conner
it
is
really
serious
miss
farwell
believe
me
it
is
or
i
should
not
have
told
you
about
it
at
all
already
harry
he
checked
himself
his
reference
to
his
friend
was
unintentional
she
finished
the
sentence
quietly
has
found
some
people
who
will
not
employ
me
because
of
the
things
that
are
being
said
i
knew
something
was
wrong
for
instead
of
telling
me
of
possible
cases
and
assuring
me
of
work
he
has
been
saying
lately
will
let
you
know
if
anything
turns
up
dan
broke
in
eagerly
abbott
has
done
everything
he
could
miss
farwell
i
ought
not
to
have
mentioned
him
at
all
you
must
not
think
she
interrupted
him
with
quiet
dignity
certainly
i
do
not
think
of
any
such
thing
you
and
abbott
are
both
very
kind
to
consider
me
in
this
way
but
really
you
must
not
be
troubled
about
this
silly
gossip
i
am
not
exactly
dependent
upon
the
good
people
of
corinth
you
know
i
can
go
back
to
the
city
at
any
time
perhaps
she
added
slowly
considering
everything
that
would
be
the
wisest
thing
to
do
after
all
it
was
only
for
grace
conner
sake
i
have
remained
dan
spoke
eagerly
again
but
you
do
not
need
to
leave
corinth
this
talk
you
know
is
all
because
of
your
companion
reputation
you
mean
she
said
quietly
the
reputation
that
people
have
given
my
companion
so
far
as
the
situation
goes
it
amounts
to
the
same
thing
he
answered
it
is
your
association
with
her
if
you
could
arrange
to
board
with
some
family
now
again
she
interrupted
him
grace
needs
me
mr
matthews
but
it
is
all
so
unjust
he
argued
lamely
the
sacrifice
is
too
great
you
ca
afford
to
place
yourself
before
the
community
in
such
a
wrong
light
the
young
woman
face
revealed
her
surprise
and
disappointment
she
had
grown
to
think
of
dan
as
being
big
and
fine
in
spirit
as
in
body
and
now
to
hear
him
voice
what
she
believed
to
be
the
spirit
and
policy
of
his
profession
was
a
shock
that
hurt
she
would
have
flashed
out
at
him
with
scornful
cutting
words
but
she
felt
intuitively
that
he
was
not
being
true
to
himself
in
this
that
he
was
forced
as
it
were
into
a
false
position
by
something
deep
down
in
his
life
this
feeling
robbed
her
of
the
power
to
reply
in
stinging
words
and
instead
gave
her
answer
a
note
of
sadness
are
you
not
advocating
the
doctrines
and
policy
of
the
people
who
are
responsible
for
the
light
rather
than
the
teachings
of
christ
are
you
not
now
speaking
professionally
having
forgotten
our
agreement
to
leave
the
preacher
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
the
big
fellow
embarrassment
was
evident
as
he
said
miss
farwell
you
must
not
you
must
not
misunderstand
me
again
i
did
not
mean
i
can
not
stand
the
thought
of
your
being
so
misjudged
because
of
this
beautiful
christian
service
i
was
only
seeking
a
way
out
no
she
said
gently
i
will
not
misunderstand
you
but
there
is
only
one
way
out
as
you
put
it
and
that
my
ministry
dan
sprang
to
his
feet
and
crossed
the
room
to
her
side
what
a
woman
you
are
he
exclaimed
impulsively
she
arose
trembling
always
when
he
came
near
something
about
this
man
moved
her
strangely
but
my
way
out
will
not
help
you
she
said
you
must
think
of
your
ministry
i
thought
we
agreed
not
to
talk
of
that
he
returned
but
we
must
you
must
consider
what
the
result
will
be
if
you
are
seen
with
me
with
grace
and
me
she
caught
herself
quickly
can
the
pastor
of
memorial
church
afford
to
associate
with
two
women
of
such
doubtful
reputation
what
will
your
church
think
she
was
smiling
as
she
spoke
but
beneath
the
smile
there
was
much
of
earnestness
she
was
determined
that
he
should
know
how
well
she
understood
his
position
she
wondered
if
he
himself
understood
it
you
see
you
will
need
to
find
a
way
out
for
yourself
she
insisted
i
am
not
looking
for
a
way
out
he
growled
ah
but
you
should
you
must
consider
your
influence
consider
the
great
harm
your
interest
in
grace
conner
will
do
your
church
you
must
remember
your
position
in
the
community
you
can
not
afford
to
to
risk
your
reputation
under
her
skillfully
chosen
words
he
again
assumed
an
air
of
indignant
reserve
she
saw
his
hands
clench
and
the
great
muscles
in
his
arms
and
shoulders
swell
unconsciously
or
was
it
unconsciously
she
had
repeated
almost
the
exact
words
of
elder
jordan
the
stock
argument
sounded
strange
coming
from
her
deliberately
she
went
on
really
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
suffer
from
this
it
is
not
necessary
for
you
to
continue
our
little
friendship
you
can
stay
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
i
we
will
understand
you
have
too
much
at
stake
you
he
interrupted
miss
farwell
i
do
know
what
you
think
of
me
that
you
can
say
these
things
i
had
hoped
that
you
were
beginning
to
look
upon
me
as
a
man
not
merely
as
a
preacher
i
had
even
dared
think
that
our
friendship
was
growing
to
be
something
more
than
just
a
little
friendly
acquaintance
if
i
am
mistaken
i
will
stay
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
if
i
am
right
if
you
do
care
for
my
friendship
he
finished
slowly
i
will
try
to
serve
my
people
faithfully
but
i
will
not
willingly
shape
my
life
by
their
foolish
wicked
whims
garden
may
get
along
without
me
and
you
may
not
need
what
you
call
little
friendship
but
i
need
denny
garden
and
i
need
you
her
face
shone
with
gladness
forgive
me
she
said
i
only
wished
to
be
sure
that
you
understood
some
things
clearly
at
her
rather
vague
words
he
said
i
am
beginning
to
understand
a
good
many
things
and
understanding
you
will
still
come
to
she
smiled
to
work
in
denny
garden
yes
he
answered
with
a
boyish
laugh
just
as
if
there
were
no
other
place
in
all
the
world
where
i
could
get
a
job
she
watched
him
as
he
swung
down
the
walk
through
the
gate
and
away
up
the
street
under
the
big
trees
and
as
she
watched
him
she
recalled
his
words
i
need
you
just
as
though
there
were
no
other
place
in
all
the
world
the
words
repeated
themselves
in
her
mind
how
much
did
they
mean
she
wondered
chapter
xxv
a
laborer
and
his
hire
but
it
was
a
reaching
out
in
the
dark
a
blind
groping
for
something
dan
knew
not
exactly
what
a
restless
but
cautious
feeling
about
for
a
place
whereon
to
set
his
feet
it
was
the
sunday
evening
following
the
incidents
just
related
that
dan
was
challenged
his
sermon
was
on
fellowship
of
service
a
theme
very
different
from
the
subjects
he
had
chosen
at
the
beginning
of
his
preaching
in
corinth
the
doctor
smiled
as
he
listened
telling
himself
that
the
boy
was
already
beginning
to
reach
out
as
usual
the
doctor
was
right
but
it
was
a
reaching
out
in
the
dark
a
blind
groping
for
something
dan
knew
not
exactly
what
a
restless
but
cautious
feeling
about
for
a
place
whereon
to
set
his
feet
with
the
sublime
confidence
of
the
this
young
shepherd
had
come
from
the
denominational
granary
to
feed
his
flock
with
a
goodly
armful
of
theological
husks
and
very
good
husks
they
were
too
it
should
be
remembered
that
while
dan
had
been
so
raised
under
the
teachings
of
his
home
that
to
an
unusual
degree
his
ideals
and
ambitions
were
most
truly
christian
he
knew
nothing
of
life
other
than
the
simple
life
of
the
country
neighborhood
where
he
was
born
he
knew
as
little
of
churches
so
that
while
it
was
natural
and
easy
for
him
to
accept
the
husks
from
his
church
teachers
at
their
valuation
being
wholly
without
the
fixed
prejudice
that
comes
from
family
church
traditions
it
was
just
as
natural
and
easy
for
him
to
discover
quickly
when
once
he
was
face
to
face
with
his
hungry
flock
that
the
husks
were
husks
from
the
charm
of
the
historical
glories
of
the
church
as
pictured
by
the
church
historians
and
from
the
equally
captivating
theories
of
speculative
religion
as
presented
by
teachers
of
schools
of
theology
dan
had
been
brought
suddenly
in
contact
with
actual
conditions
in
his
experience
of
the
past
weeks
there
was
no
charm
no
glory
no
historical
greatness
no
theoretical
perfection
there
was
meanness
shameful
littleness
actual
repulsive
shocking
he
was
compelled
to
recognize
the
real
need
that
his
husks
could
not
satisfy
it
had
been
forced
upon
his
attention
by
living
arguments
that
refused
to
be
put
aside
and
big
dan
was
big
enough
to
see
that
the
husks
did
not
suffice
consistent
enough
to
cease
giving
them
out
but
the
young
minister
felt
pitifully
empty
handed
the
doctor
had
foreseen
that
dan
would
very
soon
reach
the
point
in
his
ministerial
journey
where
he
was
now
standing
the
point
where
he
must
decide
which
of
the
two
courses
open
to
him
he
should
choose
before
him
on
the
one
hand
lay
the
easy
path
of
obedience
to
the
traditions
policies
and
doctrines
of
memorial
church
and
its
denominational
leaders
on
the
other
hand
lay
the
harder
and
way
of
truthfulness
to
himself
and
his
own
convictions
would
he
lowering
his
individual
standard
of
righteousness
wave
the
banner
of
his
employers
preaching
not
the
things
that
he
believed
to
be
the
teachings
of
jesus
but
the
things
that
he
knew
would
meet
the
approval
of
the
church
rulers
or
would
he
preach
the
things
that
his
own
prayerful
judgment
told
him
were
needed
if
his
church
was
to
be
indeed
the
temple
of
the
spirit
of
christ
in
short
dan
must
now
decide
whether
he
would
bow
to
the
official
board
that
paid
his
salary
or
to
his
god
as
the
supreme
authority
to
whom
he
must
look
for
an
indorsement
of
his
public
teaching
in
dan
case
it
was
the
teaching
of
the
four
years
of
school
against
the
teaching
of
his
home
the
home
won
being
what
he
was
by
birth
and
training
this
man
could
not
do
other
than
choose
the
harder
way
the
doctor
with
a
great
amount
of
satisfaction
saw
him
throwing
down
his
husks
and
awaited
the
outcome
with
interest
that
sermon
was
received
by
the
elders
and
ruling
classes
with
silent
uneasy
bewilderment
others
were
puzzled
no
less
by
the
new
and
unfamiliar
note
but
their
faces
expressed
a
kind
of
doubtful
satisfaction
thus
it
happened
that
with
one
exception
not
a
person
of
the
entire
audience
mentioned
the
sermon
when
they
greeted
their
minister
at
the
close
of
the
service
the
exception
was
a
big
young
farmer
whom
dan
had
never
before
met
elder
strong
introduced
him
brother
matthews
you
must
meet
brother
john
gardner
this
is
the
first
time
he
has
been
to
church
for
a
long
while
the
two
young
men
shook
hands
each
measuring
the
other
with
admiring
eyes
the
judge
continued
brother
john
used
to
be
one
of
our
most
active
workers
but
for
some
reason
he
has
dropped
behind
i
never
could
just
exactly
understand
it
he
finished
with
his
pious
patronizing
laugh
which
somehow
conveyed
the
thought
that
he
did
understand
if
only
he
chose
to
tell
and
that
the
reason
was
anything
but
complimentary
to
brother
john
the
big
farmer
face
grew
red
at
the
judge
words
he
quickly
faced
about
as
if
to
retort
but
checked
himself
and
ignoring
the
elder
said
directly
to
dan
yes
and
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
i
would
be
here
today
but
i
am
caught
late
with
my
harvesting
and
short
of
hands
i
drove
into
town
to
see
if
i
could
pick
up
a
man
or
two
i
did
find
any
so
i
waited
over
until
church
thinking
that
i
might
run
across
someone
here
dan
smiled
the
husky
fellow
was
so
uncompromisingly
honest
and
outspoken
it
was
like
a
breath
of
air
from
the
minister
own
home
hills
it
was
so
refreshing
dan
wished
for
more
and
have
you
found
anyone
he
asked
abruptly
at
the
tone
the
other
looked
at
the
minister
with
a
curious
expression
in
his
blue
eyes
the
question
was
evidently
not
what
he
had
expected
no
he
said
i
have
not
but
i
glad
i
came
anyway
your
sermon
was
mighty
interesting
to
me
sir
i
could
help
thinking
though
that
these
sentiments
about
work
would
come
a
heap
more
forceful
from
someone
who
actually
knowed
what
a
day
work
was
my
experience
has
been
that
the
average
preacher
knows
about
as
much
about
the
lives
of
the
laboring
people
as
i
do
about
theology
i
think
you
are
mistaken
there
declared
dan
the
fact
is
that
the
average
preacher
comes
from
the
working
classes
if
he
comes
from
them
he
takes
mighty
good
care
that
he
stays
from
them
retorted
the
other
but
i
got
something
else
to
do
besides
starting
an
argument
now
i
do
mind
telling
you
though
that
if
i
could
see
you
pitch
wheat
once
in
a
while
when
crops
are
going
to
waste
for
want
of
help
i
feel
that
we
was
close
enough
together
for
you
to
preach
to
me
so
saying
he
turned
abruptly
and
pushed
his
way
through
the
crowd
toward
a
group
of
who
stood
near
the
door
the
doctor
had
never
commented
to
dan
on
his
sermons
but
that
night
as
they
walked
home
together
something
made
dan
feel
that
his
friend
was
pleased
the
encounter
with
the
blunt
young
farmer
had
been
so
refreshing
that
he
was
not
so
depressed
in
spirit
as
he
commonly
was
after
the
perfunctory
meaningless
formal
compliments
and
handshaking
that
usually
closed
his
services
perhaps
because
of
this
he
for
the
first
time
sought
an
expression
from
his
old
friend
the
people
did
not
seem
to
like
my
sermon
tonight
he
ventured
the
doctor
grunted
a
single
word
stunned
do
you
think
they
will
like
it
when
they
recover
asked
dan
with
an
embarrassed
laugh
but
the
old
man
was
not
to
be
led
into
discussing
dan
work
in
my
own
practice
he
said
dryly
i
never
prescribe
medicine
to
suit
a
patient
taste
but
to
cure
him
dan
understood
he
tried
again
but
how
did
like
my
prescription
doctor
for
a
while
the
doctor
did
not
answer
then
he
said
well
you
see
dan
i
always
find
more
religion
in
your
talks
when
you
are
not
talking
religiously
just
then
a
team
and
buggy
passed
and
the
voice
of
john
gardner
hailed
them
cheerily
good
night
doctor
good
night
mr
matthews
good
night
they
answered
and
the
doctor
called
after
him
did
you
find
your
man
john
no
shouted
the
other
i
did
not
if
you
run
across
anyone
send
out
will
you
there
goes
a
mighty
fine
fellow
commented
the
old
physician
seems
to
be
agreed
dan
thoughtfully
where
does
he
live
the
doctor
told
him
adding
i
would
call
until
harvest
is
over
if
i
were
you
he
really
would
have
time
to
give
you
and
he
probably
tell
you
so
which
advice
dan
received
in
silence
the
sun
was
just
up
the
next
morning
when
john
gardner
was
hitching
his
team
to
the
big
hay
wagon
already
the
smoke
was
coming
from
the
stack
of
the
threshing
engine
that
stood
with
the
machine
in
the
center
of
the
field
and
the
crew
was
coming
from
the
two
hired
men
with
another
team
and
wagon
were
already
gathering
a
load
of
sheaves
to
haul
to
the
threshers
the
house
dog
barked
fiercely
and
the
farmer
paused
with
a
trace
in
his
hand
when
he
saw
a
big
man
turning
into
the
barn
lot
from
the
road
good
morning
called
dan
cheerily
i
feared
i
was
going
to
be
late
he
swung
up
to
the
young
fellow
who
stood
looking
at
him
too
astonished
to
speak
the
unhooked
trace
still
in
his
hand
i
understand
that
you
need
a
hand
said
dan
briefly
and
the
farmer
noticed
that
the
minister
was
dressed
in
a
rough
suit
of
clothes
a
worn
flannel
shirt
and
an
old
slouch
hat
dan
fishing
rig
with
a
slow
smile
john
turned
hooked
his
trace
and
gathered
his
lines
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
walked
out
here
from
town
this
morning
to
work
in
the
harvest
field
a
good
eight
miles
that
is
exactly
what
i
mean
returned
the
other
what
for
asked
the
farmer
bluntly
for
the
regular
wages
with
one
condition
and
the
condition
that
no
one
on
the
place
shall
be
told
that
i
am
a
preacher
and
that
for
today
at
least
i
pitch
against
you
if
by
tonight
you
are
not
satisfied
with
my
work
you
can
discharge
me
he
added
meaningly
as
dan
spoke
he
faced
the
rugged
farmer
with
a
look
that
made
him
understand
that
his
challenge
of
the
night
before
was
accepted
the
blue
eyes
gleamed
i
take
you
he
said
curtly
calling
to
his
wife
mary
give
this
man
his
breakfast
then
to
dan
when
you
get
through
come
out
to
the
machine
he
sprang
on
his
wagon
and
dan
turned
toward
the
kitchen
hold
on
a
minute
john
shouted
as
the
wagon
began
to
move
what
i
call
you
the
other
answered
over
his
shoulder
my
name
is
dan
all
that
day
they
worked
each
grimly
determined
to
handle
more
grain
than
the
other
before
noon
the
spirit
of
the
contest
had
infected
the
whole
force
every
hand
on
the
place
worked
as
if
on
a
wager
the
threshing
crew
were
all
from
distant
parts
of
the
country
and
no
one
knew
who
it
was
that
had
so
recklessly
matched
his
strength
and
staying
power
against
john
gardner
the
acknowledged
champion
for
miles
around
bets
were
freely
laid
rough
but
good
natured
chaff
flew
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
now
and
then
a
hearty
yell
echoed
over
the
field
but
the
two
men
in
the
contest
were
silent
they
scarcely
exchanged
a
word
in
the
afternoon
the
stranger
slowly
but
surely
forged
ahead
john
rallied
every
ounce
of
his
strength
but
his
giant
opponent
gained
steadily
when
the
last
load
came
in
the
farmer
threw
down
his
fork
before
the
whole
crowd
and
held
out
his
hand
to
dan
i
give
it
up
he
said
heartily
you
a
better
man
than
i
am
stranger
wherever
you
come
from
dan
took
the
offered
hand
while
the
men
cheered
lustily
but
the
light
of
battle
still
shone
in
the
minister
eyes
perhaps
he
said
pitching
is
not
your
game
i
match
you
now
tonight
for
anything
you
want
wrestling
running
jumping
or
i
go
you
at
any
time
for
any
work
you
can
name
john
slowly
looked
him
over
and
shook
his
head
i
know
when
i
got
enough
he
said
laughing
perhaps
some
of
the
boys
here
he
turned
to
the
group
the
men
grinned
as
they
measured
the
stranger
with
admiring
glances
and
one
drawled
we
do
know
where
you
come
from
pardner
but
we
sure
know
what
you
can
do
ai
nobody
in
this
outfit
hankerin
to
tackle
the
man
that
can
work
john
gardner
down
at
the
barn
the
farmer
drew
the
minister
to
one
side
look
here
brother
matthews
he
began
but
the
other
interrupted
sharply
my
name
is
dan
gardner
go
back
on
the
bargain
well
then
dan
i
wo
and
please
remember
after
this
that
my
name
is
john
i
started
to
ask
if
you
really
meant
to
stay
out
here
and
work
for
me
this
harvest
that
was
the
bargain
unless
you
are
dissatisfied
and
want
me
to
quit
tonight
the
other
rubbed
his
tired
arms
oh
i
satisfied
all
right
he
said
grimly
but
i
ca
understand
it
that
all
no
said
the
other
and
i
ca
explain
but
perhaps
if
you
were
a
preacher
and
were
met
by
men
as
men
commonly
meet
preachers
you
would
understand
clearly
enough
tired
as
he
was
the
big
farmer
laughed
until
the
tears
came
and
to
think
he
said
all
the
way
home
last
night
i
was
wondering
how
you
could
stand
it
i
understand
it
all
right
come
on
in
to
supper
he
led
the
way
to
the
house
for
three
days
dan
fairly
reveled
in
the
companionship
of
those
rough
men
who
gave
him
full
fellowship
in
their
order
of
workers
then
he
went
back
to
town
john
drove
him
in
and
the
two
chatted
like
the
good
comrades
they
had
come
to
be
until
within
sight
of
the
village
as
they
drew
near
the
town
silence
fell
upon
them
their
remarks
grew
formal
and
forced
dan
felt
as
if
he
were
leaving
home
to
return
to
a
strange
land
where
he
would
always
be
an
alien
at
his
door
the
farmer
said
awkwardly
well
goodbye
brother
matthews
come
out
whenever
you
can
the
minister
winced
but
did
not
protest
thank
you
he
returned
i
have
enjoyed
my
visit
more
than
i
can
say
and
there
was
something
so
pathetic
in
the
brown
eyes
of
the
stalwart
fellow
that
the
other
strong
man
could
make
no
reply
he
drove
quickly
away
without
a
word
or
a
backward
look
in
his
room
dan
sat
down
by
the
window
thinking
of
the
morrow
and
what
the
church
called
his
work
of
the
pastoral
visits
the
committee
meetings
the
ladies
aid
at
last
he
stood
up
and
stretched
his
great
body
to
its
full
height
with
a
sigh
then
drawing
his
wages
from
his
pocket
he
placed
the
money
on
the
study
table
and
stood
for
a
long
time
contemplating
the
pieces
of
silver
as
if
they
could
answer
his
thoughts
again
he
went
to
the
window
and
looked
down
at
denny
garden
that
throughout
the
summer
had
yielded
its
strength
to
the
touch
of
the
crippled
boy
hand
then
from
the
other
window
he
gazed
at
the
monument
on
the
corner
gazed
until
the
grim
figure
seemed
to
threaten
him
with
its
uplifted
arm
slowly
he
turned
once
more
to
the
coins
on
the
table
gathering
them
one
by
one
he
placed
them
carefully
in
an
envelope
then
seating
himself
he
wrote
on
the
little
package
the
laborer
is
worthy
of
his
hire
chapter
xxvi
the
winter
passes
and
as
the
weeks
passed
it
came
to
be
noticed
that
there
was
often
in
the
man
eyes
and
in
his
voice
a
great
sadness
the
sadness
of
one
who
toils
at
a
hopeless
task
of
one
who
suffers
for
crimes
of
which
he
is
innocent
of
one
who
fights
for
a
cause
with
the
certainty
of
defeat
the
harvest
time
passed
the
winter
came
and
was
gone
again
and
another
springtime
was
at
hand
with
its
new
life
stirring
in
blade
and
twig
and
branch
and
its
mystical
call
to
the
hearts
of
men
memorial
church
was
looking
forward
to
the
great
convention
of
the
denomination
that
was
to
be
held
in
a
distant
city
all
through
the
months
following
dan
sermon
on
the
fellowship
of
service
the
new
note
continued
dominant
in
his
preaching
and
indeed
in
all
his
work
even
his
manner
in
the
pulpit
changed
all
those
little
formalities
and
mannerisms
tricks
of
the
trade
disappeared
while
the
distinguishing
garb
of
the
clergyman
was
discarded
for
clothing
such
as
is
worn
by
the
man
in
the
pew
it
was
impossible
that
the
story
of
those
three
days
in
john
harvest
field
should
not
get
out
memorial
church
was
crowded
at
every
service
by
those
whose
hearts
responded
even
while
they
failed
to
grasp
the
full
significance
of
the
preaching
and
life
of
this
manly
fellow
who
in
spite
of
his
profession
was
so
much
a
man
among
men
but
the
attitude
of
the
church
fathers
and
of
the
ruling
class
was
still
one
of
doubt
and
suspicion
however
much
they
could
not
ignore
the
manifest
success
of
their
minister
in
spite
of
their
misgivings
their
hearts
swelled
with
pride
and
satisfaction
as
with
his
growing
popularity
they
saw
their
church
forging
far
to
the
front
and
try
as
they
might
they
could
fix
upon
nothing
unchristian
in
his
teaching
they
could
not
point
to
a
single
sentence
in
any
one
of
his
sermons
that
did
not
unmistakably
harmonize
with
the
teaching
and
spirit
of
jesus
it
was
not
so
much
what
dan
preached
that
worried
these
pillars
of
the
church
but
it
was
what
he
did
not
preach
that
made
them
uneasy
they
missed
the
familiar
pious
sayings
and
platitudes
the
that
had
been
handled
by
every
preacher
they
had
ever
sat
under
the
old
path
beaten
so
hard
and
plain
by
the
many
bearers
of
good
tidings
the
safe
sure
ground
of
denominational
doctrine
and
theological
speculation
the
familiar
type
of
prayer
even
were
all
quietly
but
persistently
ignored
by
this
stalwart
minister
who
was
often
so
much
in
earnest
in
his
preaching
that
he
forgot
to
talk
like
a
preacher
unquestionably
decided
the
fathers
this
young
giant
was
unsafe
and
wagging
their
heads
wisely
they
predicted
dire
disasters
under
their
breath
while
openly
and
abroad
they
boasted
of
the
size
of
their
audiences
and
their
minister
power
nor
did
these
keepers
of
the
faith
fail
to
make
dan
feel
their
dissatisfaction
by
hints
innumerable
by
carefully
withholding
words
of
encouragement
by
studied
coldness
they
made
him
understand
that
they
were
not
pleased
every
plan
for
practical
christian
work
that
dan
suggested
and
he
suggested
many
that
winter
they
coolly
refused
to
endorse
while
requesting
that
he
give
more
attention
to
the
activities
without
protest
or
bitterness
dan
quietly
gave
up
his
plans
and
except
in
the
matter
of
his
sermons
yielded
to
their
demands
never
was
there
a
word
of
harshness
or
criticism
of
church
or
people
in
his
talks
only
firm
but
gentle
insistence
upon
the
great
living
principles
of
teaching
and
the
people
in
his
presence
knew
often
that
feeling
the
doctor
was
conscious
of
that
this
man
was
in
some
way
that
which
they
might
have
been
some
of
his
hearers
this
feeling
saddened
with
regret
others
it
inspired
with
hope
and
filled
them
with
a
determination
to
realize
that
best
part
of
themselves
to
still
others
it
was
a
rebuke
the
more
stinging
because
so
unconsciously
given
and
they
were
filled
with
anger
and
envy
meanwhile
the
attitude
of
the
people
toward
hope
farwell
and
the
girl
whom
she
had
befriended
remained
unaltered
but
now
deborah
and
denny
as
well
came
to
share
in
their
displeasure
dan
made
no
change
in
his
relation
to
the
nurse
and
her
friends
in
the
little
cottage
on
the
other
side
of
the
garden
in
spite
of
constant
hints
insinuations
and
reflections
on
the
part
of
his
church
masters
he
calmly
deliberately
threw
down
the
gauntlet
before
the
whole
community
and
the
community
respected
and
admired
him
for
this
is
the
way
with
the
herd
even
while
it
abated
not
one
whit
its
determination
to
ruin
him
the
instant
chance
afforded
the
opportunity
so
the
spirit
that
lives
in
corinth
the
ally
waited
the
power
that
had
put
the
shadow
of
pain
over
the
life
of
grace
conner
waited
for
hope
and
dan
until
the
minister
himself
should
furnish
the
motive
that
should
call
it
into
action
dan
felt
it
felt
his
enemy
stirring
quietly
in
the
dark
watching
waiting
and
as
the
weeks
passed
it
came
to
be
noticed
that
there
was
often
in
the
man
eyes
and
in
his
voice
a
great
sadness
the
sadness
of
one
who
toils
at
a
hopeless
task
of
one
who
suffers
for
crimes
of
which
he
is
innocent
of
one
who
fights
for
a
cause
with
the
certainty
of
defeat
because
of
the
very
fine
sense
of
dan
nature
the
situation
caused
him
the
keenest
suffering
it
was
all
so
different
from
the
life
to
which
he
had
looked
forward
with
such
feelings
of
joy
it
was
all
so
unjust
many
were
the
evenings
that
winter
when
the
minister
flew
to
harry
and
his
ministry
of
music
and
in
those
hours
the
friendship
between
the
two
men
grew
into
something
fine
and
lasting
a
friendship
that
was
to
endure
always
many
times
too
dan
fled
across
the
country
to
the
farm
of
john
gardner
there
to
spend
the
day
in
the
hardest
toil
finding
in
the
ministry
of
labor
something
that
met
his
need
but
more
than
these
was
the
friendship
of
hope
farwell
and
the
influence
of
her
life
and
ministry
it
was
inevitable
that
the
very
attitude
of
the
community
should
force
these
two
friends
into
closer
companionship
and
sympathy
the
people
in
judging
them
so
harshly
for
the
course
each
had
chosen
because
to
them
it
was
right
and
the
only
course
possible
to
their
religious
ideals
drove
them
to
a
fuller
dependence
upon
each
other
dan
because
of
his
own
character
and
his
conception
of
christ
understood
as
perhaps
no
one
else
in
the
community
could
possibly
have
done
just
why
the
nurse
clung
to
grace
conner
and
the
work
she
had
undertaken
while
he
felt
that
she
grasped
as
no
one
else
the
peculiarly
trying
position
in
which
he
so
unexpectedly
found
himself
placed
in
his
ministry
and
hope
farwell
feeling
that
dan
alone
understood
her
realized
as
clearly
that
the
minister
had
come
to
depend
upon
her
as
the
one
friend
in
corinth
who
appreciated
his
true
situation
thus
while
she
gave
him
strength
for
his
fight
she
drew
strength
for
her
own
from
him
since
that
day
when
he
had
told
her
of
the
talk
of
the
people
that
matter
had
not
been
mentioned
between
them
though
it
was
impossible
that
they
should
not
know
the
attitude
of
the
community
toward
them
both
that
subtle
power
the
ally
that
is
so
irresistible
so
certain
in
its
work
depending
for
results
upon
words
with
double
meanings
suggestive
nods
tricks
of
expression
sly
winks
and
meaning
smiles
while
giving
its
victims
no
opportunity
for
defense
never
leaves
them
in
doubt
as
to
the
object
of
its
attack
the
situation
was
never
put
into
words
by
these
two
but
they
knew
and
each
knew
the
other
knew
and
their
respect
confidence
and
regard
for
each
other
grew
steadily
as
it
must
with
all
good
comrades
under
fire
in
those
weeks
each
learned
to
know
and
depend
upon
the
other
though
neither
realized
to
what
extent
so
it
came
to
be
that
it
was
not
grace
conner
alone
that
kept
miss
farwell
in
corinth
but
the
feeling
that
dan
matthews
also
depended
upon
her
the
feeling
that
she
could
not
desert
her
comrade
in
the
fight
or
as
they
had
both
come
to
feel
their
fight
hope
farwell
was
not
a
schoolgirl
she
was
a
strong
perfectly
developed
workwoman
matured
in
body
and
mind
she
realized
what
the
continued
friendship
of
this
man
might
mean
to
her
realized
it
fully
and
was
glad
dimly
too
she
saw
how
this
that
was
growing
in
her
heart
might
bring
great
pain
and
suffering
suffering
perhaps
for
save
this
their
present
common
fight
the
life
of
the
nurse
and
the
life
of
the
churchman
held
nothing
in
common
his
deepest
convictions
had
led
him
into
a
ministry
that
was
to
her
the
sheerest
folly
hope
farwell
profession
had
trained
her
to
almost
perfect
there
was
no
danger
that
she
would
let
herself
go
her
strong
passionate
heart
would
never
be
given
its
freedom
by
her
to
the
wrecking
of
the
life
upon
which
it
fixed
its
affections
she
would
suffer
the
more
deeply
for
that
very
reason
there
is
no
pain
so
poignant
as
that
which
is
borne
in
secret
but
still
still
she
was
glad
such
a
strange
thing
is
a
woman
heart
and
dan
dan
was
not
given
to
few
really
strong
men
are
he
felt
he
did
not
reason
neither
did
he
look
ahead
to
see
whither
he
was
bound
such
a
strange
thing
is
the
heart
of
a
man

deborah
trouble
i
do
know
what
he
do
but
i
know
he
do
something
he
that
kind
of
a
man
when
the
first
days
of
the
spring
came
the
doctor
coaxed
dan
away
for
a
three
days
trip
to
the
river
beyond
gordon
mills
where
the
roaring
enters
the
larger
stream
it
was
well
on
toward
noon
the
morning
that
dan
and
the
doctor
left
that
miss
farwell
found
deborah
in
tears
with
denny
trying
vainly
to
comfort
her
come
come
mother
do
be
takin
on
so
it
be
all
right
somehow
denny
was
saying
as
the
nurse
paused
on
the
threshold
of
the
little
kitchen
and
the
crippled
lad
voice
was
broken
though
he
strove
so
bravely
to
make
it
strong
the
widow
in
her
low
chair
her
face
buried
in
her
apron
swayed
back
and
forth
in
an
agony
of
grief
her
strong
form
shaking
with
sobs
denny
looked
at
the
young
woman
appealingly
as
with
his
one
good
hand
on
his
mother
shoulder
he
said
again
come
mother
look
up
it
miss
hope
that
come
to
see
you
do
do
mother
dear
we
make
it
all
right
sure
we
will
though
we
got
to
miss
farwell
went
to
denny
side
and
together
they
managed
after
a
little
to
calm
the
good
woman
it
a
shame
it
is
for
me
to
be
on
so
miss
hope
but
i
but
i
she
nearly
broke
down
again
wo
you
tell
me
the
trouble
mrs
mulhall
urged
the
nurse
perhaps
i
can
help
you
indade
dear
heart
do
i
know
you
trouble
enough
of
your
own
without
your
loadin
up
with
denny
an
mine
beside

i
seen
how
you
been
put
to
it
the
past
months
to
make
both
ends
meet
for
you
gracie
poor
child
an
you
all
the
time
fightin
to
look
cheerful
bright
so
as
to
keep
her
heartened
up
many
the
time
miss
hope
seen
the
look
on
your
own
sweet
face
when
you
thought
nobody
be
noticin
an
every
night
denny
an
me
prayed
the
blessed
virgin
to
soften
the
hearts
of
the
people
in
this
danged
town
oh
i
know
i
know
but
it
does
look
like
god
had
clean
forgotten
us
altogether
i
help
believin
it
would
be
different
somehow
if
only
we
could
go
to
mass
somewhere
like
decent
christians
ought
but
you
and
denny
have
helped
me
more
than
i
can
ever
tell
you
dear
friend
and
now
you
must
let
me
help
you
do
you
see
it
glad
enough
i
be
to
let
you
help
an
quick
enough
too
if
it
was
anything
that
you
could
fix
but
nothin
but
money
do
it
an
i
can
see
by
them
old
shoes
you
an
you
goin
with
that
old
last
year
coat
all
winter
that
you
that
you
ai
earned
but
just
enough
to
keep
you
an
gracie
alive
that
all
true
enough
mulhall
returned
the
nurse
cheerfully
but
i
am
sure
it
will
help
you
just
to
tell
me
about
the
trouble
then
with
a
little
more
urging
the
nurse
drew
from
them
the
whole
pitiful
story
at
the
time
of
jack
mulhall
death
judge
strong
had
held
a
mortgage
on
the
little
home
for
a
small
amount
by
careful
planning
the
widow
and
her
son
had
managed
to
pay
the
interest
promptly
and
the
judge
though
he
coveted
the
place
had
not
dared
to
push
the
payment
of
the
mortgage
too
soon
after
the
marshal
death
because
of
public
sentiment
but
now
sufficient
time
having
elapsed
for
the
public
to
forget
their
officer
who
had
been
killed
on
duty
and
deborah
through
receiving
grace
conner
and
miss
harwell
into
her
home
being
included
to
some
extent
in
the
damaging
comments
of
the
righteous
community
the
crafty
judge
saw
his
opportunity
he
knew
that
while
the
people
would
not
themselves
go
to
the
length
of
putting
deborah
and
her
crippled
boy
out
of
their
little
home
he
had
nothing
to
fear
from
the
sentiment
of
the
community
should
he
do
so
under
the
guise
of
legitimate
business
the
attitude
of
the
people
had
kept
deborah
from
earning
as
much
as
usual
and
for
the
first
time
they
had
been
unable
to
pay
the
interest
indeed
it
was
only
by
the
most
rigid
economy
that
they
would
be
able
to
make
their
bare
living
until
denny
garden
should
again
begin
to
bring
them
in
something
their
failure
to
pay
the
interest
gave
the
judge
added
reason
for
pushing
the
payment
of
the
debt
everything
had
been
done
in
regular
legal
form
deborah
and
denny
must
go
the
next
day
the
widow
had
exhausted
every
resource
promises
and
pleadings
were
useless
and
it
was
only
at
the
last
hour
that
she
had
given
up
but
have
you
no
relatives
mulhall
who
could
help
you
no
friends
perhaps
oldham
deborah
shook
her
head
there
only
me
an
brother
mike
in
the
family
she
said
mike
a
an
would
give
the
coat
off
his
back
for
me
but
he
movin
about
so
over
the
country
bein
single
you
see
that
i
ca
get
a
letter
to
him
i
did
write
to
him
where
i
heard
from
him
last
but
me
letter
come
back
he
do
write
often
you
see
thinkin
denny
an
me
is
all
right
i
ai
seen
him
since
he
was
here
to
help
put
poor
jack
away
for
a
few
minutes
the
silence
in
the
little
room
was
broken
only
by
poor
deborah
sobs
and
by
denny
voice
as
he
tried
to
comfort
his
mother
suddenly
the
nurse
sprang
to
her
feet
there
is
some
one
she
cried
i
knew
there
must
be
of
course
why
did
we
think
of
him
before
deborah
raised
her
head
a
look
of
doubtful
hope
on
her
face
matthews
explained
the
young
woman
deborah
face
fell
but
child
the
minister
away
with
the
doctor
an
what
good
could
he
be
doin
if
he
was
here
i
like
to
know
that
poor
himself
oh
i
do
know
what
he
do
but
i
know
he
do
something
he
that
kind
of
a
man
declared
the
nurse
with
such
conviction
that
against
their
judgment
deborah
and
denny
took
heart
and
he
not
so
far
away
but
that
he
can
be
reached
added
hope
that
afternoon
the
dilapidated
old
hack
from
corinth
to
gordon
mills
carried
a
passenger
chapter
xxviii
a
fisherman
grunted
the
other
noticed
that
there
a
lot
of
unnecessary
things
that
have
to
be
done
in
the
crisis
of
deborah
trouble
hope
had
turned
to
dan
impulsively
as
the
one
woman
turns
to
the
one
man
when
she
was
powerless
in
her
own
strength
to
meet
the
need
she
looked
confidently
to
him
but
now
that
she
was
actually
on
the
way
to
him
with
corinth
behind
and
the
long
road
over
the
hills
and
through
the
forests
before
she
had
time
to
think
while
the
conscious
object
of
her
journey
forced
itself
on
her
thinking
the
thing
that
the
young
woman
had
so
dimly
foreseen
for
herself
of
her
friendship
with
this
man
she
saw
now
more
clearly
as
she
realized
how
much
she
had
grown
to
depend
upon
him
upon
the
strength
of
his
companionship
how
she
had
learned
to
watch
for
his
coming
and
to
look
often
toward
the
corner
window
of
the
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
garden
but
after
all
she
asked
herself
was
her
regard
for
him
more
than
a
natural
admiration
for
his
strong
character
as
she
had
seen
it
revealed
in
the
past
months
their
peculiar
situation
had
placed
him
more
in
her
thoughts
than
any
man
had
ever
been
before
was
not
this
all
the
possibility
had
not
yet
become
a
certainty
the
revelation
of
hope
farwell
to
herself
was
yet
to
come
the
hack
with
its
one
passenger
arrived
at
gordon
mills
about
four
and
miss
farwell
climbing
down
from
the
ancient
vehicle
in
front
of
the
typical
country
hotel
inquired
for
oldham
the
slouchy
proprietor
of
the
place
passed
her
inquiry
on
to
a
group
of
natives
who
lounged
on
the
porch
and
one
whose
horse
was
hitched
in
front
of
the
blacksmith
shop
across
the
way
gave
the
information
that
he
had
seen
the
doctor
and
the
big
parson
at
the
mouth
of
the
creek
as
he
came
past
an
hour
before
he
added
that
he
reckoned
they
would
be
in
dark
fer
they
was
a
right
smart
of

this
from
the

and
miss

set
out
watched
by
every
eye
on
the
place
until
she
disappeared
around
the
first
bend
as
she
drew
near
the
river
the
banks
of
which
are
marked
by
a
high
bluff
on
the

side
the
young
woman
felt
a
growing
sense
of
embarrassment
what
would
matthews
think
of
her
coming
to
him
in
such
a
way
and
oldham
already
she
could
feel
the
keen
eyes
of
the
old
physician
with
their
knowing
twinkle
fixed
upon
her
face
the
doctor
always
made
you
feel
that
he
knew
so
much
more
about
you
than
you
knew
about
yourself
coming
to
the
river
at
the
mouth
of
the
creek
she
saw
them
and
half
hidden
by
the
upturned
roots
of
a
fallen
tree
she
stood
still
they
were
on
the
downstream
side
of
the
creek
dan
with
rubber
boots
that
came
to
his
hips
standing
far
out
on
the
sandy
bar
braced
against
the
current
that
tugged
and
pulled
at
his
great
legs
the
doctor
farther
down
on
the
bank
miss
farwell
watched
dan
with
the
curious
interest
a
woman
always
feels
when
watching
a
man
who
while
engaged
in
a
man
work
or
play
is
unconscious
of
her
presence
she
saw
the
fisherman
as
he
threw
the
line
far
out
with
a
strong
high
swing
of
his
long
arm
and
as
she
looked
a
lusty
bass
heavy
full
of
fight
took
the
hook
and
she
saw
the
man
stand
motionless
intent
alert
at
the
instant
he
first
felt
the
fish
then
she
caught
the
skillful
turn
of
his
wrist
as
he
struck
quick
and
sure
watched
with
breathless
interest
as
bracing
himself
the
fisherman
powerful
figure
became
instinct
with
life
with
the
boiling
water
grasping
his
legs
clinging
to
him
like
a
tireless
wrestler
seeking
the
first
unguarded
moment
and
with
the
plunging
tugging
rushing
giant
at
the
other
end
of
the
silken
line
fighting
with
every
inch
of
his
spring
steel
body
for
freedom
dan
made
a
picture
to
bring
the
light
of
admiration
to
any
woman
eyes
and
hope
farwell
was
very
much
a
woman
slowly
but
surely
the
strength
and
skill
of
the
fisherman
prevailed
the
master
of
the
waters
came
nearer
the
hand
of
his
conqueror
the
young
woman
held
her
breath
while
the
fish
made
its
last
mad
attempt
and
then
when
dan
held
up
his
prize
for
the
doctor
who
on
the
bank
had
been
in
the
fight
with
his
whole
soul
she
forgot
her
embarrassment
and
springing
into
full
view
upon
the
trunk
of
the
fallen
tree
shouted
and
waved
her
congratulations
dan
almost
dropped
the
fish
the
doctor
whose
old
eyes
were
not
so
quick
to
recognize
the
woman
on
the
log
was
amazed
to
see
his
companion
go
splashing
stumbling
ploughing
through
the
water
toward
the
shore
hope
miss
farwell
gasped
dan
floundering
up
the
bank
the
big
fish
still
in
his
hand
the
shining
water
streaming
from
his
high
boots
his
face
glowing
with
healthful
exercise
a
something
else
perhaps
what
good
fortune
brings
you
here
at
his
impetuous
manner
and
the
eagerness
that
shone
in
his
eyes
and
sounded
in
his
voice
the
woman
face
had
grown
rosy
red
but
by
the
time
the
fisherman
had
gained
a
place
by
her
side
the
memory
of
her
mission
had
driven
every
other
thought
from
her
mind
briefly
she
told
him
of
deborah
trouble
and
a
few
moments
later
the
doctor
crossing
the
creek
higher
up
joined
them
as
they
talked
hope
saw
all
the
light
and
joy
go
from
dan
face
and
in
its
place
came
a
look
of
sadness
and
determination
that
made
her
wonder
doctor
he
said
i
am
going
back
to
corinth
with
miss
farwell
tonight
we
get
a
team
and
buggy
at
the
mills
the
old
man
swore
heartily
why
had
not
the
foolish
irishwoman
let
them
know
her
situation
before
still
swearing
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
book
and
hastily
signed
a
check
here
dan
he
said
use
this
if
you
have
to
you
understand
do
hesitate
if
you
need
it
reluctantly
the
younger
man
took
the
slip
of
paper
i
do
think
it
will
be
needed
he
responded
it
ought
not
to
be
necessary
for
you
to
do
this
doctor
humph
grunted
the
other
i
noticed
that
there
a
lot
of
unnecessary
things
that
have
to
be
done
hustle
along
you
two
going
back
after
the
mate
to
that
last
one
of
yours
on
the
way
back
to
the
hotel
dan
told
the
nurse
that
the
check
would
mean
much
to
the
doctor
if
it
were
used
at
this
particular
time
but
he
added
thoughtfully
again
i
do
think
it
will
be
used
they
stopped
long
enough
at
the
hotel
for
a
hurried
lunch
then
with
a
team
and
a
stout
buggy
started
in
the
gathering
dusk
for
corinth
as
the
light
went
out
of
the
sky
and
the
mysterious
stillness
of
the
night
came
upon
them
they
too
grew
quiet
as
if
no
words
were
needed
they
seemed
to
be
passing
into
another
world
a
strange
where
they
were
alone
the
things
of
everyday
the
incidents
and
happenings
of
their
lives
seemed
to
drift
far
away
they
talked
but
little
there
was
so
little
to
say
once
dan
leaned
over
to
tuck
the
lap
robe
carefully
about
his
companion
for
the
early
spring
air
was
chill
when
the
sun
went
down
so
they
rode
until
they
saw
the
lights
of
the
town
then
it
all
came
back
to
them
with
a
rush
the
woman
drew
a
long
breath
tired
asked
dan
and
there
was
that
in
his
voice
that
brought
the
tears
to
the
gray
eyes
tears
that
he
could
not
see
because
of
the
dark
not
a
bit
she
answered
cheerfully
in
spite
of
the
hidden
tears
will
you
see
judge
strong
tonight
she
had
not
asked
him
what
he
was
going
to
do
yes
he
said
and
when
they
reached
the
big
brown
house
he
drew
the
horses
to
a
walk
i
think
if
you
are
not
too
tired
i
had
better
stop
now
i
will
not
be
long
there
was
now
something
in
his
voice
that
made
her
heart
jump
with
sudden
fear
such
as
she
had
felt
at
times
when
dr
miles
at
the
hospital
had
told
her
to
prepare
to
assist
him
in
an
operation
but
in
her
voice
no
fear
showed
itself
he
hitched
the
team
and
leaving
her
waiting
in
the
buggy
went
up
to
the
house
she
heard
him
knock
the
door
opened
sending
out
a
flood
of
light
he
entered
the
door
closed
she
waited
in
the
dark
chapter
xxix
a
matter
of
business
say
sir
that
some
things
are
inevitable
you
are
right
at
the
church
prayer
meeting
that
evening
judge
strong
prayed
with
a
fervor
unusual
even
for
him
and
in
church
circles
the
elder
was
rated
mighty
in
prayer
in
fact
the
judge
religious
capital
was
mostly
invested
in
good
safe
public
petitions
to
the
almighty
such
investments
being
rightly
considered
by
the
judge
as
for
whatever
the
returns
it
was
all
profit
theoretically
the
judge
god
noted
even
the
sparrow
fall
and
in
all
of
his
public
religious
exercises
the
judge
stated
that
fact
with
clearness
and
force
making
practical
application
of
his
favorite
text
the
judge
never
killed
sparrows
his
everyday
energies
were
spent
in
collecting
mortgages
acquiring
real
estate
and
in
like
harmless
pursuits
that
were
so
far
as
he
had
observed
not
mentioned
in
the
word
and
presumably
therefore
were
passed
over
by
the
god
of
the
sparrow
so
the
judge
prayed
that
night
with
pious
intonations
asking
his
god
for
everything
he
could
think
of
for
himself
his
church
his
town
and
the
whole
world
and
when
he
could
think
of
no
more
blessings
he
unblushingly
asked
god
to
think
of
them
for
him
and
to
give
them
all
abundantly
more
than
they
could
ask
or
desire
reminding
god
of
his
care
for
the
sparrow
he
pleaded
with
him
to
watch
over
their
beloved
pastor
who
is
absent
from
his
flock
in
search
of
ah
enjoying
ah
the
beauties
of
nature
ah
and
bring
him
speedily
back
to
his
needy
people
that
they
may
all
grow
strong
in
the
lord
supplementing
his
prayer
with
a
few
solemn
reflections
as
was
expected
from
an
elder
of
the
church
the
judge
commented
on
the
smallness
of
the
company
present
lamented
the
decline
of
spirituality
in
the
churches
declared
the
need
for
the
old
jerusalem
gospel
and
the
preaching
of
the
truth
as
it
is
in
christ
jesus
scored
roundly
those
who
were
absent
seeking
their
own
pleasure
neglecting
their
duties
while
the
world
was
perishing
and
finished
with
a
plea
to
the
faithful
to
assist
their
worthy
pastor
who
unfortunately
was
not
present
with
them
that
evening
in
every
way
possible
then
the
judge
went
home
to
occupy
the
rest
of
the
evening
with
some
matters
of
business
in
the
strong
mansion
the
room
known
as
the
library
is
on
the
ground
floor
in
a
wing
of
the
main
building
as
rooms
have
a
way
of
doing
it
expresses
unmistakably
the
character
of
its
tenant
there
is
a
with
a
few
books
standing
in
prim
cold
rows
behind
the
glass
doors
which
are
always
locked
the
key
is
somewhere
no
doubt
there
are
no
pictures
on
the
walls
save
a
fancy
calendar
presented
with
the
compliments
of
the
judge
banker
a
crayon
portrait
of
the
father
in
a
cheap
gilt
frame
and
another
calendar
compliments
of
the
judge
grocer
the
furniture
and
appointments
are
in
harmony
a
table
with
a
bible
and
a
sunday
school
quarterly
a
big
safe
wherein
the
judge
kept
his
various
mortgages
and
papers
of
value
and
the
judge
desk
being
most
conspicuous
it
is
a
significant
comment
on
the
elder
business
methods
that
in
the
top
drawer
of
his
desk
he
keeps
a
weapon
ready
for
instant
use
and
that
the
window
shades
are
always
drawn
when
the
lamps
are
lighted
sitting
at
his
desk
the
judge
heard
the
front
doorbell
ring
and
his
wife
direct
someone
to
the
library
a
moment
later
he
looked
up
from
his
papers
to
see
dan
standing
before
him
the
judge
was
startled
he
had
thought
the
young
man
far
away
then
too
the
judge
had
never
seen
the
minister
dressed
in
rough
trousers
belted
at
the
waist
a
flannel
shirt
under
a
torn
and
coat
and
boots
that
came
nearly
to
his
hips
the
slouch
hat
in
the
visitor
hand
completed
the
picture
dan
looked
big
in
any
garb
as
the
judge
saw
him
that
night
he
seemed
a
giant
and
this
giant
had
the
look
of
one
come
in
haste
on
business
of
moment
what
was
it
that
made
the
judge
reach
out
impulsively
toward
that
top
drawer
forcing
his
usual
dry
mirthless
laugh
he
greeted
dan
with
forced
effusiveness
urging
him
to
take
a
chair
declaring
that
he
hardly
knew
him
that
he
thought
he
was
at
gordon
mills
fishing
then
he
entered
at
once
into
a
glowing
description
of
the
splendid
prayer
meeting
they
had
held
that
evening
in
the
minister
absence
ignoring
the
invitation
to
be
seated
dan
walked
slowly
to
the
center
of
the
room
and
standing
by
the
table
looked
intently
at
the
man
at
the
desk
the
patter
of
the
judge
talk
died
away
the
presence
of
the
man
by
the
table
seemed
to
fill
the
whole
room
the
very
furniture
became
suddenly
cheap
and
small
the
judge
himself
seemed
to
shrink
and
he
had
a
sense
of
something
about
to
happen
swiftly
he
reviewed
in
his
mind
several
recent
deals
what
was
it
well
he
said
at
last
when
dan
did
not
speak
wo
you
sit
down
thank
you
no
answered
dan
i
can
stop
only
a
minute
i
called
to
see
you
about
that
mortgage
on
widow
mulhall
home
ah
well
i
want
to
ask
you
sir
if
it
is
not
possible
for
you
to
reconsider
the
matter
and
grant
her
a
little
more
time
the
man
at
the
desk
answered
curtly
possibly
sir
but
it
would
not
be
business
do
you
ah
consider
this
matter
as
coming
under
the
head
of
your
ah
pastoral
duties
dan
ignored
the
question
as
he
earnestly
replied
i
will
undertake
to
see
that
the
mortgage
is
paid
sir
if
you
will
give
me
a
little
time
to
which
the
other
answered
coldly
my
experience
with
promises
to
pay
has
not
been
reassuring
and
as
an
elder
in
the
church
i
may
say
that
we
do
not
employ
you
to
undertake
the
payment
of
other
people
debts
the
people
might
not
understand
your
interest
in
the
widow
affairs
again
dan
ignored
the
other
answer
though
his
face
went
white
and
his
big
hands
crushed
the
slouch
hat
with
a
mighty
grip
he
urged
what
it
would
mean
to
deborah
and
her
crippled
son
to
lose
their
little
home
and
the
garden
almost
their
only
means
of
support
but
the
face
of
the
judge
expressed
no
kindly
feeling
he
was
acting
in
a
manner
that
was
fully
legitimate
he
had
considered
it
carefully
as
for
the
hardship
some
things
in
connection
with
business
were
inevitable
as
the
elder
answered
dan
arguments
and
pleadings
the
minister
face
grew
very
sad
and
his
low
slow
voice
trembled
at
times
when
the
uselessness
of
his
efforts
were
too
evident
for
him
to
continue
the
conversation
he
turned
sadly
toward
the
door
something
caused
the
judge
to
say
do
go
yet
brother
matthews
you
see
being
a
minister
there
are
some
things
that
you
do
understand
you
are
making
a
mistake
in
he
caught
his
breath
instead
of
leaving
the
room
dan
was
closing
and
locking
the
door
he
came
back
in
three
quick
strides
this
time
he
placed
his
hat
on
the
table
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
still
low
intense
shaken
with
feeling
you
say
sir
that
some
things
are
inevitable
you
are
right
there
was
that
in
his
manner
now
that
made
the
man
in
the
chair
tremble
he
started
to
speak
but
dan
silenced
him
you
have
said
quite
enough
sir
do
think
that
i
have
not
fully
considered
this
matter
i
have
it
is
inevitable
turn
to
your
desk
there
and
write
a
letter
to
mulhall
granting
her
another
year
of
time
the
judge
tried
to
laugh
but
his
dry
lips
made
a
strange
sound
with
a
quick
movement
he
jerked
open
the
top
drawer
but
before
he
could
lay
hand
on
the
weapon
dan
leaped
to
within
easy
striking
distance
shut
that
drawer
the
judge
obeyed
now
write
i
have
the
law
on
you
i
put
you
out
of
the
christian
ministry
i
have
you
arrested
if

i
have
considered
all
that
too
said
dan

and

will
stir
up
such
a
feeling
that
the
people
of
this
community
will
drive
you
out
of
the
country
you
ca
do
it
and
live
in
corinth

too
much
at
stake

town

letter
and

of
this
incident

or
fail
to
keep
the
promise
of
your
letter
and
no
power
on
earth
shall
prevent
me
from
administering
justice
you
who
would
rob
that
crippled
boy
of
his
garden
the
man
shuddered
suddenly
he
opened
his
mouth
to
call
but
dan
reading
his
purpose
in
his
eyes
had
him
by
the
throat
before
he
could
utter
a
sound
this
was
enough
with
the
letter
in
his
pocket
dan
stood
silently
regarding
his
now
cowering
victim
and
his
deep
voice
was
full
of
pain
as
he
said
in
that
slow
way
i
regret
this
incident
brother
strong
more
than
i
can
say
i
have
no
apology
to
make
it
was
inevitable
you
have
my
word
that
no
one
shall
know
from
me
what
has
occurred
here
this
evening
when
you
think
it
all
over
you
will
not
carry
the
matter
further
you
can
not
afford
it
you
will
see
that
you
can
not
afford
it
when
the
judge
lifted
his
head
he
was
alone
did
i
keep
you
waiting
too
long
asked
dan
when
he
had
again
taken
his
place
by
miss
farwell
side
oh
no
but
tell
me
is
it
all
right
yes
it
all
right
judge
strong
has
kindly
granted
our
friends
another
year
that
will
give
us
time
to
do
something
arriving
at
the
house
he
gave
hope
the
letter
for
deborah
and
here
he
said
is
something
for
you
from
under
the
buggy
seat
he
drew
the
big
bass
when
dan
returned
to
gordon
mills
with
the
team
the
next
morning
he
gave
back
the
doctor
check
saying
simply
the
judge
listened
to
reason
and
decided
that
he
would
not
press
the
case
and
that
was
all
the
explanation
he
ever
made
though
it
was
by
no
means
the
end
of
the
matter
dan
himself
did
not
realize
what
he
had
done
he
did
not
realize
how
potent
were
the
arguments
that
he
had
used
to
convince
the
judge
the
young
minister
had
at
last
furnished
the
motive
for
which
the
ally
waited
chapter
xxx
the
daughter
op
the
church
thus
the
ally
has
something
for
everybody
dan
was
right
judge
strong
could
not
afford
to
make
public
the
facts
connected
with
the
young
man
visit
to
him
that
evening
he
could
not
afford
it
for
more
reasons
than
dan
knew
the
arguments
with
which
the
minister
had
backed
up
his
personal
influence
were
stronger
than
he
realized
the
more
the
judge
thought
about
the
whole
matter
the
more
he
was
inclined
to
congratulate
himself
that
he
had
been
saved
from
a
step
far
more
dangerous
than
he
had
ever
before
ventured
he
saw
where
in
his
desire
to
possess
all
he
had
come
perilously
near
losing
everything
but
these
reflections
did
not
make
the
elder
feel
one
whit
kindlier
towards
dan
while
the
judge
was
held
both
by
his
fear
of
dan
and
by
his
own
best
interests
from
moving
openly
against
the
man
who
had
so
effectually
blocked
his
plans
for
acquiring
another
choice
bit
of
corinth
real
estate
there
were
other
ways
perfectly
safe
by
which
he
might
make
the
minister
suffer
judge
strong
had
not
been
a
ruling
elder
in
the
church
for
so
many
years
without
learning
the
full
value
of
the
spirit
that
makes
corinth
its
home
while
the
elder
himself
feared
the
ally
as
he
feared
nothing
else
he
was
a
past
master
in
the
art
of
directing
its
strength
to
the
gaining
of
his
own
ends
his
method
was
extremely
simple
the
results
certain
when
he
learned
of
hope
trip
to
gordon
mills
and
the
long
ride
in
the
night
alone
with
dan
the
judge
fairly
hugged
himself
it
was
all
so
easy
in
the
two
days
preceding
the
next
weekly
meeting
of
the
ladies
aid
society
it
happened
quite
incidentally
that
the
elder
had
quiet
confidential
talks
with
several
of
the
most
active
workers
in
the
congregation
the
judge
in
these
talks
did
not
openly
charge
the
minister
with
wrong
conduct
with
any
neglect
of
his
duties
or
with
any
unfaithfulness
to
the
doctrines
no
indeed
the
judge
was
not
such
a
bungler
in
the
art
of
directing
the
strength
of
the
ally
in
serving
his
own
ends
but
nevertheless
each
good
sister
when
the
interview
was
ended
felt
that
she
had
been
trusted
with
the
confidence
of
the
very
inside
of
the
innermost
circle
felt
her
heart
swell
with
the
responsibility
of
a
state
secret
of
vast
importance
and
her
soul
grow
big
with
a
righteous
determination
to
be
worthy
that
was
a
ladies
aid
meeting
to
be
remembered
there
had
been
nothing
like
it
since
the
last
meeting
of
its
kind
for
of
course
every
sister
who
had
talked
with
the
judge
was
determined
that
every
other
sister
should
understand
that
she
was
on
the
innermost
inside
and
every
other
sister
who
had
talked
with
the
judge
was
equally
fired
with
the
same
purpose
and
the
sisters
who
had
not
talked
quietly
with
the
judge
were
extraordinarily
active
in
creating
the
impression
that
they
knew
even
more
than
those
who
had
so
that
altogether
things
were
hinted
half
revealed
and
fully
told
about
dan
and
miss
farwell
that
would
have
astonished
even
judge
strong
himself
had
he
not
known
just
how
it
would
be
the
sunday
following
it
seemed
almost
as
if
dan
had
wished
to
help
the
judge
in
his
campaign
for
while
there
was
much
in
his
sermon
about
widows
and
orphans
there
was
not
a
word
of
the
old
jerusalem
gospel
monday
evening
judge
strong
and
his
wife
called
upon
elder
jordan
and
his
family
and
the
two
church
fathers
held
a
long
and
important
conference
with
the
church
mothers
and
the
church
daughter
assisting
the
judge
said
very
little
indeed
he
seemed
reluctant
to
discuss
the
grave
things
that
were
being
said
in
the
community
about
their
pastor
but
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
was
earnestly
concerned
for
the
welfare
of
the
church
and
the
upbuilding
of
the
cause
in
corinth
nathan
himself
was
led
to
introduce
the
subject
the
judge
very
skillfully
and
politely
gave
the
women
opportunities
he
agreed
most
heartily
with
elder
jordan
that
dan
christian
character
was
above
reproach
and
that
it
was
very
unfortunate
that
there
should
be
any
criticism
by
the
public
such
things
so
weakened
the
church
influence
in
the
community
he
regretted
however
that
their
pastor
in
his
sermons
did
not
dwell
more
upon
first
principles
and
the
fundamental
doctrines
of
the
church
his
sermons
were
good
but
the
people
needed
to
be
taught
the
true
way
of
salvation
dan
was
young
perhaps
he
would
learn
the
foolishness
of
taking
up
these
new
ideas
of
the
church
mission
and
work
that
were
sapping
the
very
foundations
of
christianity
nathaniel
jordan
because
of
the
very
goodness
of
his
heart
and
his
deeply
religious
nature
had
learned
to
love
dan
and
to
believe
in
him
even
while
he
was
forced
by
his
whole
life
training
to
question
the
wisdom
of
the
young
man
preaching
and
while
he
was
deeply
pained
by
the
things
the
sisters
reported
he
found
as
the
judge
intended
that
elder
strong
attitude
was
in
close
harmony
with
his
own
thus
the
ally
has
something
for
everybody
those
who
did
not
doubt
character
questioned
his
preaching
and
those
who
cared
but
little
what
he
preached
found
much
to
question
in
his
conduct
but
there
was
one
in
the
company
that
evening
who
contributed
nothing
to
the
discussion
save
now
and
then
a
word
in
defense
of
dan
and
everything
that
charity
said
was
instantly
and
warmly
endorsed
by
the
judge
when
judge
and
strong
at
last
bade
their
friends
good
night
and
left
nathaniel
and
his
wife
to
cultivate
the
seed
the
ally
had
so
skilfully
planted
charity
retired
at
once
to
her
room
but
not
to
sleep
not
for
nothing
had
this
young
woman
been
reared
in
such
close
touch
with
the
inner
circle
of
the
ruling
classes
in
memorial
church
this
was
by
no
means
the
first
conference
of
its
kind
that
she
had
been
permitted
to
attend
her
whole
life
experience
enabled
her
to
judge
to
a
day
almost
the
length
of
any
minister
stay
in
corinth
few
had
stayed
more
than
a
year
there
was
rev
swanson
who
was
too
old
and
rev
wilson
it
was
his
daughter
and
rev
jones
it
was
his
wife
and
rev
george
it
was
his
son
and
it
was
rev
kern
who
did
not
get
on
with
the
young
people
and
rev
holmes
who
was
too
young
and
got
on
with
the
young
people
too
well
charity
always
thought
that
she
might
have
if
he
had
only
been
permitted
to
stay
another
three
months
and
rev
colby
it
was
because
he
had
neither
wife
nor
sons
nor
daughters
charity
was
sure
she
might
have
if
only
he
had
been
given
more
time
and
now
dan
the
poor
girl
cried
bitterly
in
the
dark
and
in
her
tears
determined
upon
desperate
measures
chapter
xxxi
the
reality
said
deborah
who
in
the
kitchen
heard
their
merry
talk
and
laughter
must
be
the
garden
as
does
it
who
shall
say
that
the
irishwoman
had
not
the
truth
of
the
whole
matter
the
incident
of
deborah
trouble
brought
hope
to
a
fuller
dependence
upon
dan
than
she
had
ever
before
known
the
long
ride
alone
in
the
hack
with
her
mind
so
filled
with
thoughts
of
her
big
friend
his
greeting
of
her
and
his
quick
response
to
her
appeal
in
deborah
behalf
with
the
drive
home
in
the
night
by
his
side
and
the
immediate
success
of
his
call
upon
the
judge
had
all
led
the
young
woman
much
nearer
a
full
realization
of
herself
and
a
complete
understanding
of
her
feeling
for
dan
than
she
knew
but
one
touch
more
was
needed
to
make
the
possibility
which
she
had
long
foreseen
a
reality
the
touch
needed
came
early
in
the
afternoon
of
the
day
following
the
judge
call
upon
elder
jordan
miss
farwell
with
grace
and
denny
was
in
the
garden
making
ready
for
the
first
early
seed
at
dan
urgent
request
a
much
larger
space
had
been
prepared
this
year
and
they
were
all
intensely
interested
in
what
was
to
be
they
declared
the
best
and
largest
garden
that
denny
had
ever
grown
denny
with
his
useless
twisted
arm
swinging
at
his
side
and
his
poor
dragging
leg
was
marking
off
the
beds
and
rows
the
while
he
kept
up
a
ceaseless
merry
chatter
with
the
two
young
women
who
assisted
him
by
carrying
the
stakes
and
lines
any
one
would
have
thought
they
were
the
happiest
people
in
all
corinth
and
perhaps
they
were
though
from
all
usual
standards
they
had
little
enough
to
be
joyous
over
denny
with
his
poor
crippled
body
forever
barred
from
the
life
his
whole
soul
craved
yearning
for
books
and
study
with
all
his
heart
but
forced
to
give
the
last
atom
of
his
poor
strength
in
digging
in
the
soil
for
the
bare
necessities
of
life
denied
even
a
pittance
to
spend
for
the
volumes
he
loved
grace
conner
marred
in
spirit
and
mind
as
was
denny
in
body
by
the
cruel
unjust
treatment
of
those
to
whom
she
had
a
right
to
look
first
for
sympathy
and
help
and
the
nurse
who
was
sacrificing
a
successful
and
remunerative
career
in
the
profession
she
loved
to
carry
the
burden
of
this
one
who
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
had
no
claim
whatever
upon
her
what
had
they
to
be
joyous
over
that
sunny
afternoon
in
the
garden
faith
said
deborah
who
in
the
kitchen
heard
their
merry
talk
and
laughter
it
must
be
the
garden
as
does
it
who
shall
say
that
the
irishwoman
had
not
the
truth
of
the
whole
matter
the
three
merry
workers
were
expecting
dan
but
dan
did
not
come
and
it
may
have
been
because
hope
turned
her
eyes
so
often
toward
the
corner
window
that
she
failed
to
see
the
young
woman
who
turned
in
at
their
own
gate
then
deborah
voice
called
from
the
kitchen
for
miss
hope
and
the
nurse
went
into
the
house
it
someone
to
see
you
said
the
widow
with
an
air
of
great
mystery
i
tuck
her
into
your
room
where
she
waitin
for
you
dear
heart
but
the
day
has
brung
the
roses
to
your
cheeks
and
the
sunshine
is
in
your
two
eyes
sure
i
ca
think
what
she
be
wantin
i
hope
is
to
make
ye
the
less
happy
than
ye
are
oh
you
with
your
blarney
returned
the
young
woman
playfully
and
then
with
a
note
of
eagerness
in
her
voice
who
is
it
do
you
know
her
sure
i
do
and
so
will
you
when
you
see
her
go
on
in
child
do
be
standin
here
maybe
it
the
job
you
been
lookin
for
come
at
last
i
ca
think
that
any
of
them
would
be
sendin
for
you
though
the
good
lord
knows
the
poor
creature
herself
looks
to
need
a
nurse
or
somethin
she
pushed
hope
from
the
kitchen
and
a
moment
later
the
young
woman
entered
her
own
room
to
find
miss
charity
jordan
hope
harwell
was
a
beautiful
woman
beautiful
with
the
beauty
of
a
womanhood
unspoiled
by
vain
idleness
empty
pleasures
or
purposeless
activity
perhaps
because
of
her
interest
and
care
for
the
girl
to
whom
she
was
filling
the
place
of
both
mother
and
elder
sister
perhaps
because
of
something
else
that
had
come
into
her
life
the
past
few
months
in
spite
of
her
trials
had
added
much
to
that
sweet
atmosphere
of
womanliness
that
enveloped
her
always
the
deep
gray
eyes
seemed
deeper
still
and
a
light
was
in
their
depths
that
had
not
been
there
before
in
her
voice
too
there
was
a
new
note
a
richer
fuller
tone
and
she
moved
and
laughed
as
one
whose
soul
was
filled
with
the
best
joys
of
living
charity
arose
to
her
feet
when
miss
farwell
entered
the
nurse
greeted
her
but
the
poor
girl
who
had
spent
an
almost
sleepless
night
stood
regarding
the
woman
before
her
with
a
kind
of
envying
wonder
what
right
had
this
creature
to
be
so
happy
while
she
a
christian
was
so
miserable
to
charity
there
were
only
two
kinds
of
people
those
who
belonged
to
the
church
and
those
who
belonged
to
the
world
those
of
the
world
were
strangers
aliens
the
life
they
lived
their
pleasures
their
ambitions
their
loves
were
all
matters
of
conjecture
to
this
daughter
of
the
church
they
were
to
her
people
to
save
never
people
to
be
intimate
with
nor
were
they
to
be
regarded
without
grave
suspicion
until
they
were
saved
she
wondered
sometimes
what
they
were
like
if
one
were
to
really
know
them
as
she
had
thought
about
it
the
night
before
in
the
dark
it
was
a
monstrous
thing
that
a
woman
of
this
other
world
should
have
ensnared
their
minister
her
minister
charity
was
a
judge
of
preachers
she
saw
in
dan
the
ability
to
go
far
she
felt
that
no
position
in
the
church
was
too
high
for
him
to
reach
no
honor
too
great
for
him
to
attain
if
only
he
might
be
steadied
and
inspired
and
assisted
by
a
competent
helper
one
thoroughly
familiar
with
every
detail
of
the
denominational
machinery
and
acquainted
with
every
denominational
engineer
thus
to
be
robbed
of
the
high
place
in
life
for
which
she
had
fitted
herself
and
to
which
she
had
aspired
for
years
by
an
alien
to
the
church
was
maddening
if
only
charity
had
possessed
the
capacity
for
being
maddened
what
right
had
this
creature
who
never
entered
a
church
what
right
had
she
even
to
the
friendship
of
a
minister
a
minister
such
as
dan
and
to
ruin
his
reputation
to
cause
him
to
be
sent
away
from
corinth
to
wreck
his
career
to
deprive
him
of
a
companion
so
fitly
qualified
to
help
him
realize
to
the
full
his
splendid
ambition
small
wonder
that
the
daughter
of
the
church
had
determined
upon
a
desperate
measure
left
alone
when
deborah
had
gone
to
call
miss
farwell
charity
had
examined
the
nurse
room
with
interest
and
surprise
the
apartment
bore
no
testimony
to
an
unholy
life
save
that
it
was
in
every
way
a
poorer
place
than
any
room
in
the
jordan
house
it
might
have
been
charity
own
there
was
even
a
bible
well
worn
at
that
lying
on
a
table
by
which
a
chair
was
drawn
as
if
the
reader
had
but
just
laid
the
book
aside
and
now
this
woman
stood
before
her
this
woman
with
the
deep
kind
eyes
the
soft
calm
voice
her
cheeks
glowing
with
healthful
outdoor
exercise
and
her
air
of
sweet
womanliness
the
nurse
spoke
the
second
time
i
am
miss
farwell
you
are
miss
jordan
i
believe
i
see
you
pass
the
house
frequently
wo
you
be
seated
please
you
seem
to
be
in
trouble
poor
charity
dropping
weakly
into
a
chair
she
burst
into
bitter
tears
then
before
miss
farwell
could
recover
from
her
surprise
the
caller
exclaimed
i
came
to
see
you
about
our
minister
reverend
matthews
the
color
in
the
nurse
cheeks
deepened
but
why
should
you
come
to
me
about
matthews
i
know
nothing
of
your
church
affairs
miss
jordan
i
know
that
you
do
not
the
other
returned
bitterly
you
have
never
been
to
hear
him
preach
you
know
nothing
nothing
of
what
it
means
to
him
to
me
to
all
of
us
i
mean
how
could
you
know
anything
about
it
this
passionate
outburst
and
the
sight
of
charity
crimson
face
and
embarrassed
manner
caused
the
color
to
disappear
from
the
nurse
cheeks
after
a
moment
she
said
coolly
do
you
not
think
it
would
be
well
for
you
to
explain
clearly
just
what
you
mean
and
why
you
come
to
me
in
her
effort
to
explain
charity
words
came
tumbling
recklessly
impetuously
out
in
all
sorts
of
disorder
she
charged
the
nurse
with
ruining
the
minister
work
with
alienating
him
from
his
people
with
injuring
the
memorial
church
and
the
cause
of
christ
in
corinth
with
making
him
the
talk
of
the
town
what
is
he
to
you
she
finished
what
can
he
ever
be
to
you
you
would
not
dare
to
think
of
marrying
a
minister
of
the
gospel
you
a
woman
of
the
world
he
belongs
to
us
he
does
not
belong
to
you
and
you
have
no
right
to
take
him
from
us
then
she
pleaded
with
her
to
as
she
put
it
let
their
pastor
alone
to
permit
him
to
stay
in
corinth
and
go
on
to
the
great
future
that
she
was
so
sure
awaited
him
as
the
girl
talked
the
other
woman
sat
very
still
with
downcast
face
save
now
and
then
when
charity
disordered
words
seemed
to
carry
a
deeper
meaning
than
appeared
upon
the
surface
then
the
gray
eyes
were
lifted
to
study
the
speaker
face
doubtfully
wonderingly
questioningly
in
her
painful
excitement
charity
was
telling
much
more
than
she
realized
and
more
charity
was
not
only
laying
bare
her
own
heart
to
the
nurse
but
she
was
revealing
hope
farwell
to
herself
that
young
woman
was
stirred
as
she
had
never
been
before
when
her
visitor
had
talked
herself
out
the
nurse
said
quietly
miss
jordan
it
is
not
at
all
necessary
that
i
should
reply
to
the
things
you
have
said
but
you
must
answer
me
one
question
has
matthews
ever
either
by
word
or
by
his
manner
towards
you
given
you
reason
to
feel
that
you
personally
have
any
right
whatever
to
say
these
things
to
me
it
was
so
frank
so
direct
and
withal
so
womanly
and
kind
and
so
unexpected
that
charity
hung
her
head
tell
me
please
miss
jordan
after
all
that
you
have
said
you
must
the
answer
came
in
a
whisper
no
thank
you
there
was
that
in
the
nurse
voice
that
left
the
heart
hopeless
and
robbed
her
of
power
to
say
more
she
rose
and
moved
toward
the
door
the
nurse
accompanied
her
to
the
porch
miss
jordan
charity
paused
i
am
very
sorry
i
fear
you
will
never
understand
how
how
mistaken
you
are
i
i
shall
not
harm
either
your
church
or
your
minister
believe
me
i
am
very
very
sorry
miss
farwell
could
not
return
to
the
garden
he
would
be
there
she
could
not
meet
him
just
yet
she
must
be
alone
she
must
go
somewhere
to
think
this
thing
out
stealing
from
the
house
she
slipped
away
down
the
street
without
her
conscious
will
her
feet
led
her
toward
the
open
country
to
academy
hill
to
the
grassy
knoll
under
the
oak
in
the
old
academy
yard
the
possibility
had
become
a
reality
and
all
the
pain
that
she
had
foreseen
was
hers
but
with
the
pain
was
a
great
gladness
miss
farwell
need
not
have
fled
from
meeting
dan
in
the
garden
that
afternoon
dan
was
not
in
the
garden
while
the
nurse
in
her
room
was
greeting
miss
charity
elder
jordan
who
had
stopped
on
his
way
home
from
the
post
office
was
knocking
at
the
door
of
the
minister
study
chapter
xxxii
the
barrier
as
he
looked
at
the
figure
so
immovable
so
hideously
rigid
and
fixed
in
the
act
of
proclaiming
an
issue
that
belonged
to
a
dead
age
he
felt
as
if
his
heart
would
burst
with
wild
rage
at
the
whole
community
people
and
church
the
elder
visit
to
dan
was
prompted
not
alone
by
the
church
situation
as
he
had
come
to
look
upon
it
in
the
conference
with
judge
strong
the
evening
before
but
by
the
old
man
regard
for
the
young
minister
himself
because
of
this
he
had
said
nothing
to
his
brother
official
of
his
purpose
wishing
to
make
his
visit
something
more
than
an
official
call
in
the
interest
of
the
church
nathaniel
felt
that
alone
he
could
talk
to
dan
in
a
way
that
would
have
been
impossible
in
the
presence
of
judge
strong
and
in
this
he
was
not
mistaken
in
the
months
of
his
work
in
corinth
dan
had
learned
to
love
this
old
church
father
whose
faithfulness
to
the
dead
past
and
to
the
obsolete
doctrines
of
his
denomination
was
so
large
an
element
in
his
religion
it
was
impossible
not
to
recognize
that
so
far
as
the
claims
of
his
creed
would
permit
elder
jordan
was
a
true
christian
man
gentle
tolerant
kind
in
all
things
outside
the
peculiar
doctrine
of
the
founders
of
his
sect
it
was
impossible
for
the
minister
and
his
elder
to
see
life
from
the
same
point
of
view
they
belonged
to
different
ages
the
younger
man
recognizing
this
honored
his
elder
brother
for
his
fidelity
to
the
faith
of
his
fathers
and
saw
in
this
very
faith
a
virtue
to
admire
but
the
older
man
saw
in
dan
broader
views
and
neglect
of
the
issues
that
belonged
to
the
past
age
a
weakness
of
christian
character
to
be
overcome
if
possible
but
on
no
ground
to
be
tolerated
lest
the
very
foundation
of
the
church
be
sapped
elder
jordan
regard
for
dan
was
wholly
personal
entirely
aside
from
the
things
of
the
church
the
elder
was
capable
of
sacrificing
his
own
daughter
if
in
his
judgment
it
was
necessary
for
the
good
of
the
cause
but
he
would
not
have
loved
her
the
less
there
was
that
inhuman
something
in
his
religion
that
has
always
made
religion
a
thing
of
schools
and
churches
rather
than
a
thing
of
farms
and
shops
a
thing
of
set
days
of
forms
rites
ceremonies
beliefs
rather
than
a
thing
of
everyday
living
and
the
commonplace
individual
duties
pleasures
and
drudgeries
of
life
the
old
churchman
did
not
spare
dan
that
afternoon
very
clearly
he
forced
the
minister
to
see
the
situation
making
him
understand
the
significance
of
the
gossip
that
had
been
revived
and
the
growing
dissatisfaction
of
the
church
leaders
with
his
sermons
dan
listened
quietly
with
no
lack
of
respect
for
the
man
who
talked
to
him
so
plainly
for
under
the
sometimes
harsh
words
he
felt
always
the
true
spirit
of
the
speaker
and
his
kindly
regard
touching
his
preaching
dan
could
make
no
reply
for
he
realized
how
impossible
it
was
for
the
elder
to
change
his
point
of
view
the
young
minister
had
indeed
neglected
the
things
that
to
the
elder
and
his
kind
were
the
vital
things
that
he
had
taught
the
truths
that
to
him
seemed
most
vital
made
no
difference
in
the
situation
the
fact
remained
that
he
was
the
hired
servant
of
memorial
church
and
was
not
employed
by
that
body
to
preach
what
he
considered
the
most
vital
truths
but
touching
his
friendship
with
the
nurse
dan
spoke
warmly
in
defense
of
the
young
woman
of
himself
he
said
nothing
as
the
elder
listened
he
thought
he
saw
how
dan
had
been
influenced
in
his
ministry
by
this
woman
who
was
not
of
the
church
and
the
idea
that
had
sent
charity
to
miss
farwell
took
possession
of
him
even
as
his
daughter
pleaded
with
the
nurse
to
set
the
minister
free
nathaniel
pleaded
with
dan
to
free
himself
inevitably
the
results
were
exactly
the
same
think
of
your
ministry
my
boy
urged
the
old
man
of
the
sacred
duties
of
your
office
your
attitude
towards
this
woman
has
been
in
every
way
just
what
the
people
expect
the
conduct
of
a
man
to
be
toward
the
one
he
is
seeking
to
make
his
wife
yet
no
one
for
a
moment
thinks
you
expect
to
marry
this
woman
who
is
known
to
be
an
alien
to
the
church
what
success
could
you
hope
to
have
as
a
minister
if
you
take
to
wife
one
who
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
your
church
what
right
have
you
then
to
be
so
intimate
with
her
to
seek
her
company
so
constantly
granting
all
that
you
say
of
her
character
and
all
that
dr
miles
has
written
why
does
she
stay
in
corinth
where
no
one
will
employ
her
when
she
could
so
easily
return
to
her
work
in
the
city
taking
that
conner
girl
with
her
dan
could
find
no
words
to
answer
the
elder
he
was
stunned
by
the
situation
to
which
he
had
been
so
suddenly
awakened
by
the
old
plain
words
but
there
were
elements
in
the
problem
unknown
to
nathaniel
jordan
though
the
old
man
felt
that
somehow
his
lance
had
gone
deeper
than
he
intended
when
the
elder
was
gone
dan
mind
and
heart
clutched
those
words
no
one
believes
for
a
moment
that
you
expect
to
marry
this
woman
to
marry
this
woman
to
marry
to
marry
he
thought
of
his
father
and
mother
and
their
perfect
companionship
what
right
have
you
in
this
case
to
be
so
intimate
with
her
to
seek
her
company
so
constantly
he
started
to
go
to
the
window
that
looks
down
on
the
garden
thinking
to
see
her
there
but
checked
himself
he
knew
now
why
the
garden
had
grown
to
mean
so
much
to
him
he
tried
to
realize
what
his
life
would
be
without
this
woman
who
had
so
grown
into
it
dan
matthews
was
no
weakling
who
could
amuse
himself
with
a
hundred
imitation
love
affairs
in
his
veins
ran
the
fierce
red
blood
of
a
strong
race
that
had
ruled
by
the
simple
strength
of
manhood
their
mountain
wilderness
as
the
tiny
stream
flowing
quietly
through
peaceful
meadow
still
woodland
and
sunny
pasture
growing
always
broader
and
deeper
as
it
runs
is
unconscious
of
its
quiet
power
until
checked
by
some
barrier
and
rising
swelling
to
a
mighty
flood
seeks
to
clear
its
path
so
dan
love
had
grown
in
the
fields
of
friendship
it
had
gained
always
depth
and
power
until
now
coming
to
the
barrier
it
rose
in
all
its
strength
a
flood
of
passion
that
shook
every
nerve
and
fibre
of
the
man
being
a
mighty
force
that
would
not
be
denied
going
to
the
other
window
he
saw
the
monument
and
as
he
looked
at
the
figure
so
immovable
so
hideously
rigid
and
fixed
in
the
act
of
proclaiming
an
issue
that
belonged
to
a
dead
age
he
felt
as
if
his
heart
would
burst
with
wild
rage
at
the
whole
community
people
and
church
what
right
had
he
to
the
companionship
of
this
woman
the
right
that
god
has
given
to
every
man
nay
to
every
beast
and
bird
the
right
to
seek
his
mate
the
right
of
the
future
what
right
indeed
had
anyone
to
challenge
him
to
say
that
he
should
not
win
her
if
he
could
if
he
could
as
suddenly
as
the
rage
had
come
it
left
him
and
he
shrank
hopeless
within
himself
cowering
before
the
thought
of
his
position
in
life
and
of
her
attitude
toward
the
church
and
its
ministers
the
elder
and
his
people
need
give
themselves
no
uneasiness
he
thought
the
barrier
was
too
to
be
swept
aside
by
love
of
man
and
woman
he
saw
that
now
even
the
old
friendship
between
them
would
be
impossible
he
wondered
if
his
going
out
of
her
life
would
make
any
ripple
in
its
calm
even
current
if
she
would
care
very
much
the
elder
had
asked
why
has
she
remained
in
corinth
could
it
be
no
no
that
would
be
too
much
it
was
her
interest
in
grace
conner
alone
that
held
her
so
big
dan
faced
this
thing
against
which
the
very
strength
of
his
manhood
was
his
greatest
weakness
and
facing
it
he
too
was
afraid
to
go
into
the
garden
as
he
thought
to
meet
her
he
must
gain
a
little
first
he
must
grow
better
acquainted
with
this
thing
that
had
come
upon
him
so
quickly
following
the
instinct
of
his
ancestors
to
face
trouble
in
the
open
he
too
set
out
bound
for
a
long
tramp
across
the
country
perhaps
he
would
go
as
far
even
as
john
gardner
and
spend
the
night
there
he
went
up
the
street
for
a
block
before
turning
north
lest
his
friends
in
the
garden
hail
him
then
walking
quickly
he
pushed
on
towards
the
outskirts
of
town
on
the
old
academy
hill
road
chapter
xxxiii
hearts
tragedies
so
she
sent
him
away
to
fight
his
battle
alone
knowing
it
was
the
only
way
such
a
battle
could
be
rightly
fought
when
miss
farwell
under
the
oak
tree
in
the
academy
yard
turned
her
eyes
from
the
far
blue
roll
of
hills
to
see
dan
matthews
coming
through
the
gap
in
the
fence
it
was
as
if
he
had
appeared
in
answer
to
her
thoughts
and
the
intensity
of
her
emotions
at
the
moment
frightened
her
her
first
impulse
was
to
escape
then
she
sat
still
watching
him
as
if
fascinated
while
her
trembling
fingers
picked
at
the
young
grass
by
her
side
with
his
face
turned
toward
the
valley
below
dan
came
slowly
across
the
yard
unconscious
of
the
presence
of
the
young
woman
on
the
knoll
then
he
looked
in
her
direction
with
her
face
turned
quickly
she
saw
him
stop
suddenly
as
if
halted
by
the
same
feeling
that
had
so
moved
her
for
a
full
minute
he
stood
there
as
if
questioning
his
senses
the
girl
sat
very
still
once
she
thought
he
would
turn
back
then
he
came
on
eagerly
as
he
had
come
that
day
from
the
water
when
he
had
looked
up
to
see
her
on
the
river
bank
and
then
he
stood
before
her
as
he
had
stood
that
other
day
long
weeks
ago
with
the
sunlight
on
his
hair
there
was
now
no
word
of
formal
greeting
none
was
needed
each
seemingly
knew
the
travail
of
soul
of
the
other
dropping
down
on
the
grass
by
her
side
he
said
quietly
as
if
it
were
unnecessary
that
he
should
speak
at
all
i
thought
you
were
in
the
garden
this
afternoon
and
i
thought
you
were
in
the
garden
she
returned
he
looked
at
her
in
wondering
gladness
saying
i
had
a
caller
after
that
i
could
not
go
and
i
i
too
had
a
caller
and
after
that
i
i
could
not
go
the
words
were
spoken
almost
in
a
whisper
her
trembling
fingers
were
picking
again
at
the
short
young
grass
she
was
looking
far
away
beyond
the
sweeping
line
of
blue
one
foot
had
slipped
a
little
from
under
the
protecting
shelter
of
the
blue
skirt
he
saw
with
a
flush
of
anger
that
the
shoe
was
very
shabby
the
skirt
too
showed
unmistakable
signs
of
wear
he
controlled
himself
with
difficulty
saying
your
caller
was
miss
charity
jordan
and
yours
elder
jordan
dan
looked
away
and
when
he
spoke
again
he
said
bitterly
then
i
suppose
you
know
at
his
tone
and
manner
she
turned
her
face
quickly
to
his
permitting
him
for
the
first
time
to
search
her
eyes
it
was
as
if
she
wanted
to
comfort
him
to
reassure
him
yes
she
said
softly
gladly
triumphantly
yes
i
know
something
in
her
confident
reply
caused
the
minister
to
forget
all
his
resolutions
his
work
his
life
the
possible
outcome
the
world
itself
were
lost
in
the
overpowering
rush
of
the
that
swept
his
being
his
deep
voice
trembled
then
you
know
that
i
love
you
love
you
he
repeated
the
simple
words
as
if
laying
his
whole
self
body
soul
and
spirit
at
her
feet
and
the
woman
in
very
wonder
at
the
fullness
of
the
offering
was
as
one
transfixed
and
could
find
no
word
fit
to
express
her
acceptance
of
the
gift
it
is
my
right
to
tell
you
this
he
said
proudly
defiantly
almost
as
though
challenging
some
unseen
spirit
or
power
and
it
is
your
right
to
answer
me
yes
she
said
it
is
our
right
then
you
do
care
for
me
hope
i
am
not
mistaken
you
do
can
you
doubt
it
she
asked
he
moved
quickly
toward
her
but
she
checked
him
and
while
the
love
in
her
eyes
answered
to
the
mastering
passion
in
his
she
seemed
in
some
subtle
manner
to
build
up
a
protecting
wall
between
them
a
wall
to
guard
them
both
i
do
not
understand
he
faltered
you
must
think
she
bade
him
quietly
firmly
do
you
see
that
while
it
is
right
for
you
to
tell
me
what
you
have
and
right
for
me
to
tell
you
how
proud
how
glad
your
words
have
made
me
and
how
with
all
my
heart
and
life
i
i
love
you
this
her
voice
faltered
now
you
see
that
this
must
be
all
all
he
questioned
all
she
answered
everything
that
i
said
to
you
the
first
day
that
we
met
here
is
still
true
do
you
see
that
i
can
never
never
be
more
to
you
than
i
am
now
as
one
who
hears
himself
sentenced
to
big
dan
dropped
his
head
burying
his
face
in
his
hands
and
seeing
him
so
such
a
figure
of
helpless
strength
the
woman
gray
eyes
filled
with
tears
that
were
not
yet
permitted
to
fall
in
his
presence
she
would
be
strong
afterwards
her
own
heart
should
have
its
way
once
her
hand
went
out
slowly
towards
the
shaggy
hair
but
was
silently
withdrawn
and
the
trembling
white
fingers
again
plucked
the
young
blades
of
grass
so
they
sat
these
two
face
to
face
with
their
hearts
tragedy
each
for
the
other
sake
striving
to
be
strong
tell
me
he
said
at
last
raising
his
head
but
not
looking
her
in
the
face
and
speaking
in
tones
that
were
strained
and
hard
if
i
were
anything
else
if
i
were
engaged
in
any
other
work
would
you
be
my
wife
why
do
you
ask
that
because
i
must
know
he
answered
almost
harshly
if
you
were
a
common
laborer
a
business
or
professional
man
if
your
work
was
anything
honorable
and
right
save
what
it
is
yes
gladly
oh
how
gladly
then
he
burst
forth
hotly
i
will
give
up
my
work
i
will
be
something
else
you
would
give
up
your
ministry
for
me
she
questioned
doubtfully
your
chosen
life
work
his
voice
sank
to
a
hoarse
whisper
yes
and
if
it
need
be
my
religion
my
god
as
he
finished
speaking
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
hush
oh
hush
that
is
not
worthy
of
you
it
is
not
true
to
our
love
you
are
beside
yourself
he
continued
eagerly
but
i
have
learned
that
other
work
is
just
as
holy
just
as
sacred
as
the
work
of
the
preacher
and
the
church
you
do
not
know
how
in
the
past
months
i
have
been
teaching
this
why
should
i
not
give
my
life
to
some
of
these
other
ministries
because
it
is
not
some
other
work
that
calls
you
now
these
other
ministries
are
not
yours
she
answered
gently
i
have
learned
to
love
you
because
you
are
so
truly
yourself
because
you
are
so
true
to
yourself
you
must
not
disappoint
me
now
and
you
will
not
she
continued
confidently
i
know
that
you
will
not
at
last
when
he
had
argued
protested
and
pleaded
until
she
was
so
beset
by
both
his
passion
and
her
own
that
she
felt
her
strength
going
she
said
do
oh
please
do
i
can
not
listen
to
more
of
this
now
it
is
not
fair
to
either
of
us
you
must
have
time
to
think
alone
i
believe
i
know
you
even
better
than
you
know
yourself
you
must
leave
me
now
you
must
promise
that
you
will
not
try
to
see
me
again
until
tomorrow
afternoon
at
this
same
hour
i
will
be
in
the
garden
with
the
others
until
four
when
i
will
go
to
the
house
alone
if
then
you
have
decided
that
you
can
with
all
truthfulness
to
yourself
and
me
give
up
your
ministry
come
to
me
and
i
will
be
your
wife
but
whether
you
come
or
not
you
must
always
believe
that
i
love
you
that
i
shall
always
love
you
as
my
other
self
and
that
i
shall
never
never
doubt
your
love
for
me
so
she
sent
him
away
to
fight
his
battle
alone
knowing
it
was
the
only
way
such
a
battle
could
be
rightly
fought
and
because
she
wanted
him
for
his
own
sake
to
have
the
certainty
of
a
victory
never
doubting
in
her
own
heart
what
that
victory
would
be
or
what
it
would
mean
to
her
she
indeed
knew
him
better
than
he
knew
himself

with

white
and
drawn
dan
went
to
the
window
all
that
afternoon
knowing
that
she
was
there
he
had
denied
himself
even
the
sight
of
her
now
he
would
see
her
he
watched
as
without
a
glance
toward
his
window
the
young
woman
left
her
friends
and
went
slowly
into
the
house
five
ten
fifteen
twenty
minutes
the
ticking
of
the
little
clock
seemed
to
beat
on
dan
brain
with
blows
then
he
saw
her
come
out
on
the
front
porch
of
the
cottage
slowly
she
walked
out
into
the
yard
until
screened
from
the
street
by
the
big
lilac
bush
turning
she
faced
toward
his
window
she
waved
a
greeting
she
even
beckoned
to
him
to
come
the
man
swayed
and
put
out
his
hand
to
grip
the
window
casing
again
she
beckoned
him
come
when
he
did
not
leave
his
place
and
only
waved
a
hand
in
return
she
went
slowly
back
into
the
house
then
dan
matthews
minister
man
staggered
back
from
the
window
to
fall
on
his
knees
in
prayer
it
was
perhaps
two
hours
before
sunrise
when
harry
horse
stopped
suddenly
in
a
dark
stretch
of
timber
six
miles
from
town
dimly
the
man
in
the
buggy
saw
a
figure
coming
toward
him
hello
he
said
sharply
what
do
you
want
the
man
in
the
road
laughed
a
strange
hoarse
mirthless
laugh
saying
as
he
continued
to
advance
i
thought
it
must
be
you
you
nearly
ran
me
down
and
dan
climbed
in
by
the
physician
side
the
minister
made
no
explanation
nor
did
his
friend
after
the
first
few
surprised
questions
press
him
but
when
they
were
turning
in
towards
dan
gate
the
big
fellow
burst
forth
do
stop
harry
not
here
for
god
sake
if
you
love
me
take
me
on
to
your
house
for
a
little
while
then
did
harry
guess
the
truth
that
later
he
came
to
know
chapter

the
tie
that

was
there
in

the

of
the

the

and

in

of

have
the

all
the
next
day
dan
remained
at
harry
home
returning
to
his
own
rooms
in
the
evening
early
the
following
morning
he
was
to
take
the
train
for
the
annual
gathering
of
the
denomination
that
was
to
be
held
in
a
distant
city
he
would
be
away
from
corinth
three
days
at
least
the
minister
little
study
when
he
had
lighted
the
lamp
that
night
seemed
filled
with
a
spirit
that
was
never
there
before
it
was
as
if
during
his
absence
some
unseen
presence
had
moved
in
to
share
the
apartment
with
him
the
very
books
and
papers
impressed
him
as
intimate
companions
as
if
in
thus
witnessing
and
in
truth
taking
part
in
the
of
the
man
they
had
entered
into
a
closer
relation
to
him
a
relation
sacred
and
holy
he
was
conscious
too
of
an
atmosphere
of
privacy
there
that
he
had
never
sensed
before
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
drew
the
window
shades
in
the
battle
that
hope
farwell
had
set
for
him
to
fight
dan
had
sought
to
be
frankly
honest
with
himself
and
to
judge
himself
coldly
without
regard
to
the
demands
of
his
heart
if
he
had
erred
at
all
it
was
in
an
to
conscience
for
conscience
has
ever
been
a
tricky
master
often
betraying
its
slaves
to
their
own
it
is
a
large
question
whether
one
has
a
greater
right
to
injure
himself
than
to
harm
another
dan
could
not
admit
even
to
himself
that
he
had
in
any
way
neglected
the
church
or
fallen
short
of
his
duties
as
a
hired
shepherd
but
after
all
was
he
not
to
some
degree
in
error
in
his
judgment
of
his
people
had
he
not
perhaps
misunderstood
the
spirit
that
moved
them
he
had
come
to
corinth
from
his
school
with
the
thought
fixed
in
his
mind
that
the
church
was
right
had
he
not
by
the
unexpected
and
brutal
directness
of
his
experience
been
swung
to
the
other
extreme
conceiving
conditions
as
all
wrong
groping
in
the
dark
of
his
ministry
he
had
come
to
feel
more
and
more
keenly
his
inexperience
after
all
was
he
right
in
taking
the
hard
path
or
was
not
the
safe
way
of
the
church
fathers
the
true
way
was
not
his
failure
to
put
himself
in
tune
with
things
as
he
found
them
only
his
own
inability
to
grasp
the
deeper
meanings
of
those
things
he
had
come
to
doubt
those
leaders
whom
he
had
been
taught
to
follow
but
he
had
come
to
doubt
more
his
own
ability
to
lead
or
even
to
find
the
way
for
himself
it
was
this
doubt
that
had
led
him
to
decide
as
hope
farwell
knew
he
would
big
dan
could
not
turn
from
the
church
and
his
chosen
work
without
the
same
certainty
that
had
led
him
to
least
of
all
could
he
after
that
which
hope
had
made
so
clear
go
to
her
with
a
shadow
of
doubt
in
his
mind
his
convictions
were
not
as
yet
convincing
his
love
for
the
woman
bulked
too
large
in
his
life
for
him
to
trust
his
own
motives
so
it
came
that
he
had
chosen
at
such
cost
to
himself
and
making
the
greatest
sacrifice
possible
to
one
of
his
nature
turned
to
give
himself
wholly
to
that
which
he
still
felt
to
be
his
ministry
he
looked
forward
now
with
eagerness
to
the
gathering
of
church
men
to
which
he
was
going
on
the
morrow
there
he
would
meet
the
great
leaders
of
his
church
those
with
experience
in
the
work
to
which
he
had
given
himself
those
whose
names
were
household
names
in
the
homes
of
his
people
there
he
would
come
into
touch
with
the
spirit
of
the
church
as
a
whole
not
merely
the
spirit
of
his
own
local
congregation
and
in
the
deliberations
of
the
convention
in
their
reports
of
work
accomplished
of
conditions
throughout
the
country
and
in
the
plans
for
work
to
be
done
he
would
find
he
must
find
the
key
that
would
put
him
in
full
harmony
with
those
who
were
his
dan
thoughts
were
interrupted
by
a
familiar
knock
at
the
door
the
old
doctor
entered
of
the
talk
of
the
community
regarding
dan
and
hope
and
of
the
growing
sentiment
of
memorial
church
the
doctor
knew
all
that
dan
knew
with
this
more
from
long
observation
he
understood
as
dan
did
not
the
real
significance
of
this
revival
of
activities
by
the
ally
and
the
part
that
judge
strong
had
in
its
inspiration
concerning
dan
and
hope
he
could
only
conjecture
but
the
doctor
conjectures
amounted
almost
to
certainties
that
the
lad
so
dear
to
him
was
passing
through
some
tremendous
crisis
he
knew
for
he
had
talked
with
harry
that
afternoon
seeing
by
the
light
in
the
window
that
dan
had
returned
he
had
run
across
the
way
to
see
if
all
was
well
with
the
boy
it
was
characteristic
of
the
doctor
that
while
he
did
not
make
known
the
object
of
his
visit
in
words
he
made
the
minister
feel
his
sympathy
and
interest
and
his
readiness
as
he
himself
would
have
said
to
stand
by
grasping
his
young
friend
hand
in
greeting
and
placing
his
other
hand
on
dan
shoulder
he
studied
his
face
as
he
would
have
studied
a
patient
come
boy
he
said
do
you
think
we
better
go
fishing
the
minister
smiled
back
at
him
i
wish
i
could
doctor
i
need
it
all
right
but
you
see
there
that
convention
tomorrow
humph
grunted
the
doctor
as
he
seated
himself
heard
who
going
dan
named
a
few
of
his
church
people
the
doctor
grunted
again
they
were
nearly
all
of
the
inner
circle
the
judge
confidantes
in
matters
of
the
church
judge
strong
is
going
too
offered
the
doctor
dan
said
nothing
told
me
this
evening
the
old
man
chuckled
i
rather
thought
i
go
myself
you
dan
said
in
surprise
the
other
eyes
twinkled
yes
me
why
not
i
never
been
to
one
of
these
affairs
but
for
that
matter
neither
have
you
i
do
suppose
they
would
put
me
out
anyway
i
have
some
business
in
the
city
and
i
thought
it
would
be
fine
for
us
to
go
up
together
martha
tickled
to
death
thinks
i
get
it
sure
if
i
can
only
hear
some
of
the
really
preachers
dan
laughed
he
could
not
know
of
the
real
motive
that
prompted
the
doctor
strange
interest
in
this
great
meeting
of
church
men
the
next
morning
at
an
early
hour
they
were
off
dan
the
old
doctor
some
six
or
eight
of
the
active
women
leaders
of
the
congregation
charity
and
judge
strong
the
ally
went
also
there
was
no
little
surprise
expressed
in
a
manner
by
the
company
at
the
presence
of
oldham
and
there
was
much
putting
together
of
heads
in
whispered
consultation
as
to
what
it
might
mean
the
judge
and
his
competent
associates
with
the
ally
kept
very
much
together
and
left
dan
and
his
friend
as
much
to
themselves
whenever
the
young
minister
prompted
by
his
thoughts
of
the
last
few
hours
approached
the
group
there
was
a
significant
hush
while
his
pleasantries
were
met
by
very
formal
and
as
evidently
forced
monosyllables
which
very
soon
sent
him
back
to
his
seat
again
with
a
face
that
made
the
old
doctor
say
things
under
his
breath
look
here
dan
said
the
old
physician
as
they
neared
their
destination
i
understand
that
at
these
meetings
the
visiting
delegates
are
always
entertained
at
the
homes
of
the
local
church
people
i
not
a
delegate
so
i
go
to
a
hotel
you
come
with
me
be
my
guest
tell
you
have
already
accepted
an
invitation
to
stop
with
a
friend
do
worry
they
be
glad
enough
to
have
one
less
to
care
for
and
i
want
you
the
young
man
eagerly
accepted
at
the
meeting
was
the
usual
gathering
of
the
usual
types
there
were
the
leaders
regularly
appointed
by
the
denomination
who
were
determined
to
keep
that
which
had
been
committed
to
them
at
any
cost
and
to
this
end
glorified
in
the
lord
service
the
common
political
methods
of
distributing
the
places
of
conspicuous
honor
and
power
upon
program
and
committee
among
those
friends
and
favorites
who
could
be
depended
upon
to
respond
most
emphatically
or
who
were
in
the
vernacular
safe
equally
active
with
methods
as
familiar
but
not
equally
in
evidence
for
one
must
be
careful
were
the
leaders
who
for
the
glory
of
christ
sought
these
same
seats
of
the
mighty
and
who
were
assisted
by
those
who
aspired
to
become
their
friends
and
favorites
joint
heirs
in
their
success
should
they
succeed
then
there
were
the
leaders
who
pushed
and
pulled
and
scrambled
to
the
front
content
if
they
could
only
for
the
moment
be
thought
by
the
multitude
to
be
something
more
than
they
were
who
were
on
their
feet
instantly
to
speak
upon
every
question
with
ponderous
weight
of
words
and
were
most
happy
if
they
could
fill
some
vacant
chair
on
the
platform
there
were
the
heresy
hunters
who
sniffed
with
eagerness
for
the
scent
of
doctrinal
weakness
in
the
speeches
of
their
brothers
and
upon
every
proposed
movement
of
the
body
guarded
with
bulldog
fidelity
the
faith
of
their
fathers
there
were
also
the
young
preachers
who
came
to
look
with
awe
on
the
doings
of
the
great
ones
to
learn
how
it
was
done
and
to
watch
for
a
possible
opening
whereby
they
might
snatch
their
bit
of
glory
here
on
earth
many
there
were
of
this
latter
class
who
from
the
highest
religious
motives
had
answered
the
call
to
the
ministry
as
to
something
sacred
and
holy
even
as
had
dan
these
young
men
though
they
knew
it
not
were
there
to
learn
how
their
leaders
while
theoretically
depending
upon
god
for
their
strength
and
guidance
in
managing
the
affairs
of
the
church
depended
actually
upon
the
very
methods
which
when
used
by
the
world
in
its
affairs
they
stamped
ungodly
the
ally
was
there
in
power
the
day
of
the
rack
the
thumbscrew
and
the
stake
is
long
past
in
place
of
these
instruments
of
religious
discipline
we
have
the
ally
mostly
those
on
the
firing
line
were
ministers
though
here
and
there
a
prominent
woman
leader
pushed
to
the
front
the
rest
were
brothers
and
sisters
mainly
sisters
who
like
other
mortals
always
backed
their
favorites
in
the
race
that
was
set
before
them
all
these
prayed
sincerely
and
devoutly
that
somehow
in
ways
beyond
their
bewildered
ken
the
good
god
would
bless
the
efforts
that
were
being
made
for
righteousness
and
truth
hoping
thus
for
heavenly
results
from
very
worldly
methods
judge
strong
was
an
old
campaigner
a
heavy
contributor
to
the
general
work
and
missionary
funds
to
which
the
leaders
looked
for
the
practical
solution
of
their
modest
bread
and
butter
problems
he
had
the
ears
of
them
all
nor
was
the
elder
slow
to
use
his
advantage
he
could
speak
his
mind
with
frankness
here
for
these
great
men
of
the
church
lived
far
from
corinth
and
while
knowing
much
of
the
elder
the
church
man
knew
nothing
of
the
judge
the
citizen
and
neighbor
more
than
this
such
reports
as
the
elder
had
to
make
must
in
the
very
nature
of
things
for
the
good
of
the
cause
be
strictly
private
while
the
judge
was
holding
these
little
confidential
chats
with
the
leaders
and
the
leaders
were
holding
equally
confidential
chats
with
their
friends
and
favorites
and
these
in
turn
were
doing
as
they
had
been
done
by
the
elder
assistants
assigned
to
various
church
homes
in
the
city
were
confidentially
exchanging
confidences
with
their
hostesses
and
this
is
the
simple
truth
of
the
whole
matter
and
the
way
it
all
came
about
dan
was
introduced
to
the
secretary
ah
yes
brother
matthews
of
corinth
glad
to
meet
you
ah
excuse
me
i
ah
see
a
brother
over
there
with
whom
i
must
speak
dan
was
presented
to
the
treasurer
oh
yes
i
have
heard
of
you
at
corinth
why
hello
brother
simpkins
catching
a
passing
preacher
by
the
arm
glad
to
see
you
how
are
you
and
how
is
the
work
dan
introduced
himself
to
one
or
two
of
those
whom
he
had
hungered
to
see
those
who
were
noted
in
the
church
papers
for
their
broad
wisdom
and
saintly
character
and
somehow
dan
felt
rebuked
for
his
forwardness
when
each
from
his
pedestal
looked
at
him
and
said
oh
yes
brother
matthews
i
have
heard
of
you
brother
matthews
during
the
forenoon
session
of
the
second
day
the
order
of
business
was
reports
of
the
churches
in
response
to
roll
call
one
after
the
other
the
representatives
of
the
various
congregations
would
tell
what
they
had
done
and
what
they
were
going
to
do
oldham
remarked
later
no
one
told
what
they
had
failed
to
do
or
what
they
were
not
going
to
do
as
a
rule
the
ministers
reported
for
their
own
churches
save
when
some
delegate
whom
the
pastor
knew
to
be
peculiarly
qualified
was
present
generally
speaking
the
ministers
consider
the
value
of
such
a
report
to
be
greatly
increased
if
it
can
be
given
by
some
such
member
the
minister
himself
always
sees
that
the
report
is
properly
prepared
judge
strong
without
consulting
dan
responded
to
the
call
for
the
memorial
church
there
was
a
distinct
hush
and
heads
went
forward
in
interest
the
elder
regretted
to
report
that
while
they
had
held
their
regular
services
every
sabbath
and
their
preacher
was
the
most
popular
preacher
in
corinth
the
conversions
for
some
reason
had
not
been
as
numerous
as
in
some
previous
years
but
memorial
church
could
be
depended
upon
to
remedy
that
very
soon
for
they
were
contemplating
a
great
revival
meeting
to
begin
as
soon
as
a
competent
evangelist
could
be
secured
loud
applause
from
the
professional
evangelists
present
they
felt
that
a
series
of
good
old
jerusalem
gospel
sermons
would
put
them
again
to
the
front
in
the
matter
of
additions
loud
applause
from
the
defenders
of
the
faith
dan
listened
in
silent
amazement
this
was
the
first
he
had
heard
of
a
meeting
in
corinth
the
doctor
saw
the
boy
face
grow
burning
red
the
elder
continued
his
report
touching
every
department
of
the
church
in
like
vein
and
finished
by
regretting
exceedingly
that
their
offering
for
the
missionary
and
for
the
general
work
for
the
present
year
had
fallen
short
of
previous
years
the
judge
did
not
explain
that
he
had
subtracted
from
his
part
in
the
church
offering
an
amount
exceeding
the
shortage
which
amount
he
had
added
to
his
usual
personal
subscription
as
for
the
regular
expenses
of
the
congregation
he
went
on
they
had
been
cared
for
and
remarked
the
state
secretary
in
a
loud
voice
rising
instantly
as
the
judge
sat
down
i
want
you
all
to
know
that
judge
strong
personal
contribution
to
our
funds
is
larger
this
year
than
ever
before
we
who
know
brother
strong
splendid
christian
generosity
will
understand
how
the
regular
expenses
of
memorial
church
have
been
paid
whereupon
the
and
the
joined
with
one
accord
in
loud
applause
not
a
preacher
there
but
understood
exactly
what
the
elder
report
signified
following
the
reports
of
the
churches
came
the
introductions
of
the
new
pastors
skilfully
the
preachers
were
marshaled
upon
the
platform
big
dan
towering
at
the
foot
of
the
line
stunned
and
embarrassed
as
he
was
by
the
judge
report
the
boy
would
not
have
gone
forward
at
all
had
not
the
doctor
fairly
pushed
him
into
the
aisle
the
old
philosopher
told
himself
grimly
that
the
lad
might
as
well
get
all
that
was
coming
to
him
in
the
ceremony
that
followed
dan
got
it
one
after
the
other
the
ministers
were
introduced
by
the
secretary
who
had
a
glowing
word
for
each
brother
williams
who
has
done
such
marvelous
work
at
baxter
loud
applause
for
brother
williams
brother
hardy
who
is
going
to
do
a
wonderful
work
at
wheeler
louder
applause
for
brother
hardy
and
so
on
down
the
line
not
one
from
big
church
or
little
from
city
pulpit
or
country
district
but
secured
the
boosting
comment
and
the
applause
for
this
was
christian
enthusiasm
dan
turn
came
at
last
his
face
was
now
white
and
this
shouted
the
secretary
is
brother
matthews
the
present
pastor
of
our
church
at
corinth
there
was
a
hush
still
and
significant
for
this
was
church
policy
after
a
moment
silence
the
secretary
continued
please
sing
hymn
and
one
be
the
tie
that
binds
our
hearts
in
christian
love
everybody
sing
and
the
denominational
papers
agreed
that
they
made
a
joyful
noise
unto
the
lord
were
the
high
officials
and
their
mates
on
this
ship
of
salvation
to
be
blamed
not
a
bit
of
it
the
elder
report
made
dan
unsafe
and
he
was
they
were
right
more
than
this
the
lord
needed
the
influence
and
money
when
the
young
minister
came
back
to
his
seat
his
old
friend
thought
his
face
the
saddest
he
had
ever
seen
at
lunch
the
doctor
told
dan
that
he
was
going
to
call
upon
several
friends
that
afternoon
and
among
them
mentioned
the
superintendent
of
a
famous
steel
plant
in
the
city
agreeing
to
meet
at
dinner
in
the
evening
they
parted
dan
going
alone
to
the
convention
building
at
the
door
he
paused
several
ministers
chatting
gaily
with
friends
passing
in
for
the
opening
of
the
afternoon
session
looked
curiously
at
the
stalwart
irresolute
figure
standing
there
alone
two
or
three
greeted
him
with
a
word
all
were
sorry
for
him
for
not
one
but
understood
the
meaning
of
the
incidents
of
the
morning
an
hour
later
the
superintendent
of
the
great
steel
works
greeted
with
admiring
eyes
the
big
fellow
and
wondered
at
the
look
of
sadness
on
his
face
i
am
in
the
city
with
my
friend
oldham
explained
dan
i
expected
to
find
him
here
he
told
me
at
lunch
that
he
was
coming
oldham
in
town
good
exclaimed
the
man
of
affairs
of
course
he
would
look
me
up
but
he
has
been
here
yet
glad
to
meet
any
friend
of
the
doctor
sit
down
matthews
he
be
in
presently
no
doubt
or
perhaps
while
you
waiting
you
would
care
to
look
about
at
eager
reply
he
touched
a
bell
and
to
the
man
who
appeared
he
said
jack
show
matthews
around
a
friend
of
my
friend
dr
oldham
and
so
the
doctor
found
the
boy
standing
in
the
very
heart
of
the
great
plant
where
the
brawny
workmen
naked
to
the
waist
their
bodies
shining
with
sweat
and
streaked
with
grime
wrestled
with
the
grim
realities
of
life
for
a
little
while
the
doctor
watched
him
then
tapping
him
on
the
shoulder
shouted
in
his
ear
above
the
roar
of
the
furnace
the
hissing
of
steam
and
the
crash
and
clank
of
iron
and
steel
almost
as
good
as
a
fishing
trip
heh
dan
back
in
the
office
again
the
superintendent
introduced
them
to
a
smooth
faced
portly
gentleman
the
president
of
the
steel
company
a
capitalist
the
great
man
repeated
dan
name
looking
him
over
the
while
matthews
by
your
name
and
your
build
sir
you
are
related
to
the
grant
matthews
who
owns
dewey
bald
he
is
my
father
sir
returned
dan
delighted
ah

through
my
interests
in
the
lead
and
zinc
industry
i
am
familiar
with
your
part
of
the
country
sir
i
have
met
your
father
several
times
it
is
not
easy
to
forget
such
a
man
dan
now
remembered
the
president
name
having
heard
it
in
connection
with
the
mines
on
jake
creek
near
his
home
the
capitalist
continued
i
have
tried
several
times
to
persuade
your
father
to
open
up
that
hill
of
his
he
has
a
fortune
in
that
mountain
sir
a
fortune
are
you

people

ever
decide
to
develop
that
property
come
to
me
i
know
what
it
is
we
would
be
glad
to
talk
it
over
with
you
sir
glad
to
have
met
you
good
day
doctor
and
he
was
gone
the
doctor
and
dan
dined
with
the
genial
superintendent
and
his
family
that
evening
and
the
next
morning
set
out
for
corinth
chapter
xxxvi
but
the
big
house
for
harry
is
still
empty
when
he
returns
from
his
long
drives
empty
save
for
his
dreams
when
hope
farwell
dismissed
dan
that
afternoon
in
the
old
academy
yard
because
she
feared
both
for
her
lover
and
for
herself
she
had
not
for
a
moment
questioned
what
dan
decision
would
be
with
all
the
gladness
that
their
love
had
brought
there
was
in
her
heart
no
hope
for
she
exacted
of
herself
the
same
fidelity
to
her
religious
convictions
that
she
demanded
of
dan
it
would
be
as
wrong
for
her
to
accept
the
church
as
for
him
to
reject
it
so
she
had
gone
to
the
limit
of
her
strength
for
his
sake
but
when
she
reached
again
the
privacy
of
her
room
her
woman
nature
had
its
way
with
the
morning
strength
returned
again
strength
and
calmness
quietly
she
went
about
for
while
she
had
left
the
whole
burden
of
decision
upon
dan
her
heart
was
with
her
lover
in
his
fight
at
the
appointed
hour
she
left
her
friends
in
the
garden
and
went
into
the
house
as
she
had
planned
she
did
not
expect
him
but
she
had
said
that
she
would
wait
his
coming
her
heart
beat
painfully
as
the
slow
minutes
passed
bringing
by
his
absence
proof
that
she
had
not
misjudged
him
then
she
went
outside
and
looking
up
saw
him
standing
at
his
window
smiling
she
even
beckoned
to
him
she
wished
to
make
the
victory
certain
final
and
complete
very
quietly
she
returned
to
her
room
she
did
not
again
enter
the
garden
and
now
the
young
woman
was
conscious
that
she
also
had
a
part
to
do
for
every
reason
she
must
not
remain
in
corinth
she
explained
her
plans
to
grace
for
she
could
not
leave
the
girl
and
the
two
commenced
to
make
their
simple
preparations
for
the
journey
feeling
that
her
strength
was
not
equal
to
the
strain
which
another
meeting
with
dan
would
occasion
there
was
no
one
left
to
bid
save
deborah
and
denny
and
abbott
abbott
faithful
jim
was
waiting
ready
for
a
long
trip
into
the
country
when
miss
farwell
reached
the
physician

harry
himself
dressed
for
the
drive
met
her
at
the
door
you

the
nurse

to
hurry

he
led
her
to
the
library
i
came
to
tell
you
she
said
i
could
not
go
away
without
thanking
you
abbott
for
all
your
kindness
to
me
the
strong
hands
of
the
physician
so
firm
and
sure
in
their
professional
duties
trembled
as
the
man
placed
his
hat
and
gloves
on
the
table
to
tell
me
he
repeated
blankly
yes
she
answered
i

paused

find
her
a
place
in
the
hospital

said

day

she
answered
with
a
shudder
if
you
come
to
the
city
though
i
shall
always
be
glad
to
see
you
the
words
were
as
frank
as
from
one
man
to
another
harry
was
thinking
of
his
friend
the
minister
of
the
meeting
in
the
night
and
dan
plea
to
be
taken
to
the
doctor
home
where
he
had
remained
until
late
the
evening
before
he
left
for
the
church
convention
why
was
she
leaving
corinth
while
dan
was
away
attending
the
convention
did
she
know
that
he
was
gone
what
did
it
all
mean
could
it
be
he
started
from
his
chair
i
may
see
you
again
then
you
will
be
glad
to
see
me
miss
farwell
hope
tell
me
surely
you
know
what
i
would
say
i
would
have
said
it
long
ago
but
you
would
not
let
me
tell
me
if
there
is
any
chance
for
me
ever
she
had
risen
to
her
feet
and
into
her
face
there
came
a
look
of
tender
sadness
she
did
not
turn
away
and
the
man
looking
into
those
gray
eyes
knew
that
she
spoke
truly
when
she
said
i
am
sorry
abbott
oh
so
sorry
no
there
can
never
be
for
you
more
than
my
regard
and
friendship
her
voice
trembled
i
know
how
it
hurts
because
for
me
for
us
too
there
is
no
chance
then
harry
abbott
understood
she
left
him
in
the
library
outside
she
paused
a
moment
to
bestow
a
caress
upon
the
doctor
horse
and
then
she
quickly
went
away
other
helpers
have
now
taken
the
place
of
the
faithful
old
mam
liz
and
uncle
george
for
these
true
souls
have
gone
to
the
master
of
all
who
truly
serve
but
the
big
house
for
harry
is
still
empty
when
he
returns
from
his
long
drives
empty
save
for
his
dreams
harry
will
never
leave
corinth
when
the
old
doctor
berates
him
roughly
for
wearing
himself
out
for
those
who
never
express
their
appreciation
and
from
whom
he
can
never
hope
to
receive
a
fee
he
laughingly
retorts
in
kind
charging
the
doctor
himself
with
having
consigned
to
him
such
unprofitable
patients
he
will
never
give
up
his
patients
neither
will
he
give
up
his
dreams

for

life
she

story

to
a
place
in

herself

ministry

those
who
have
themselves

no
amount
of

make
up
for
a
lack

sympathy
and

as
dan
home
from
the
convention
was
turning
wearily
in
at
his
gate
deborah
from
the
garden
called
to
him
by
her
manner

she
came

results
when
he
had
finished
his
letter
he
bowed
his
face
in
his
hands
and
wept
dan
could
not
or
perhaps
it
should
be
written
would
not
understand
rightly
his
experience
at
the
church
convention
sadly
puzzled
and
surprised
by
the
spirit
and
atmosphere
of
that
meeting
to
which
he
had
gone
with
such
confidence
and
sorely
hurt
by
his
reception
he
had
no
thought
of
the
real
reason
for
it
all
he
only
blamed
himself
the
more
for
being
so
out
of
harmony
for
failing
so
grievously
to
find
the
key
that
should
put
him
in
tune
in
the
great
steel
works
among
the
sweating
toiling
men
with
the
superintendent
of
the
plant
under
whose
hand
men
and
machinery
were
made
to
serve
a
great
world
need
and
with
the
president
whose
brain
and
genius
was
such
a
power
in
the
financial
and
industrial
world
dan
had
felt
a
spirit
of
kinship
amid
those
surroundings
he
had
been
as
much
at
home
as
if
he
were
again
in
his
native
hills
and
for
the
hour
had
forgotten
his
fellow
churchmen
and
their
ministries
but
as
their
train
drew
nearer
and
nearer
corinth
the
doctor
saw
by
his
face
and
by
his
fits
of
brooding
silence
that
the
minister
was
feeling
again
the
weight
of
his
troublesome
burden
by
this
and
by
what
he
had
seen
at
the
convention
the
old
physician
knew
that
the
hour
in
dan
life
for
which
he
watched
with
such
careful
anxious
interest
was
drawing
near
with
hope
gone
out
of
his
life
he
turned
to
his
work
with
grim
desperate
determination
what
indeed
had
he
now
to
which
he
might
turn
but
his
work
he
realized
that
now
he
must
find
in
this
work
for
which
he
had
made
the
supreme
sacrifice
of
his
life
the
only
thing
that
would
to
him
justify
his
choice
the
choice
that
had
cost
both
him
and
the
woman
he
loved
so
much
suffering
his
ministry
had
now
become
something
more
to
him
than
a
chosen
life
work
to
those
high
motives
that
had
led
him
to
the
service
of
the
church
he
added
now
the
price
he
had
paid
in
giving
up
the
woman
who
had
grown
so
much
into
his
life
he
find
that
in
his
ministry
which
would
make
the
great
price
paid
not
in
vain
so
with
all
the
strength
of
his
great
nature
he
threw
himself
with
feverish
energy
into
what
had
in
spite
of
himself
come
to
be
a
ministry
crushing
every
feeling
of
being
misunderstood
and
unjustly
criticized
permitting
himself
no
thought
that
there
were
under
the
surface
treacherous
currents
working
for
his
overthrow
blaming
himself
always
and
others
never
when
he
felt
a
lack
of
warmth
or
sympathy
in
his
people
yielding
for
the
time
even
his
own
conviction
as
to
his
teaching
and
striving
to
shape
his
sermons
to
the
established
lines
of
the
elders
he
fought
to
put
himself
into
his
work
and
always
at
the
beck
and
call
of
dan
real
masters
that
other
servant
of
the
church
that
spirit
that
lives
in
corinth
wrought
the
will
of
those
whose
ally
it
is
that
last
meeting
of
dan
and
hope
in
the
academy
yard
as
if
by
appointment
the
sudden
departure
of
the
nurse
so
soon
after
and
state
of
mind
were
all
skilfully
used
to
give
color
to
the
ugly
whispered
reasons
for
the
nurse
leaving
town
so
hurriedly
the
old
doctor
knowing
watching
waited
for
the
hour
he
knew
would
come
understanding
dan
as
he
had
always
understood
him
wisely
recognizing
the
uselessness
of
doing
aught
but
let
him
go
his
own
strong
hard
way
and
harry
also
knowing
the
malignant
power
that
was
forcing
the
end
and
conscious
what
the
end
would
be
watched
silently
hopelessly
helplessly
as
many
a
time
he
had
watched
the
grim
drawing
near
of
that
one
whose
certain
coming
his
professional
knowledge
enabled
him
to
recognize
while
giving
him
no
power
to
stay
memorial
church
was
all
astir
and
on
the
tiptoe
of
expectancy
preparing
they
said
for
the
greatest
revival
ever
held
in
corinth
the
professional
evangelist
selected
by
the
elder
whose
choice
was
as
a
matter
of
course
approved
by
his
fellow
officials
and
congregation
had
sent
full
instructions
for
the
proper
advertising
of
himself
and
as
his
instructions
stated
the
working
up
of
the
meeting
dan
ignoring
the
slight
to
himself
in
the
matter
of
calling
the
evangelist
did
everything
in
his
power
to
carry
out
his
part
of
the
instructions
the
evangelist
arrived
royally
received
by
the
elders
and
the
inner
circle
he
was
escorted
in
triumph
to
the
strong
mansion
which
was
to
be
his
home
during
the
meeting
and
within
the
hour
began
his
professional
duty
of
setting
the
church
in
order
and
gathering
a
mighty
harvest
of
souls
this
evangelist
was
a
good
one
of
his
kind
his
kind
is
that
type
of
professional
evolved
by
the
system
whereby
the
church
pays
for
the
increase
of
its
flock
at
so
much
per
head
inasmuch
as
the
number
of
his
calls
and
the
amount
of
his
hire
depend
upon
the
number
of
additions
per
meeting
to
the
evangelist
credit
a
with
small
meetings
to
his
credit
receives
a
very
modest
compensation
for
his
services
and
short
notices
in
the
church
papers
but
the
big
fellows
those
who
have
hundreds
of
souls
per
meeting
come
higher
much
higher
also
they
have
more
space
given
them
in
the
papers
which
helps
them
to
come
higher
still
souls
may
have
depreciated
in
value
since
calvary
but
one
thing
is
sure
the
price
of
has
gone
away
up
since
the
days
of
paul
and
his
fellow
ministers
preaching
every
night
and
conducting
afternoon
meetings
calling
at
the
homes
of
the
people
directing
the
efforts
of
the
members
of
the
inner
circle
sometimes
with
dan
oftener
without
him
fully
informed
and
instructed
by
the
judge
whose
guest
he
was
and
to
whom
he
looked
for
a
larger
part
of
his
generous
salary
the
evangelist
made
himself
no
small
power
in
the
church
of
corinth
assisted
always
by
the
skill
and
strength
of
the
ally
the
effectiveness
of
his
work
from
the
standpoint
of
elder
strong
and
the
inner
circle
at
least
was
assured
that
was
a
great
meeting
a
mighty
revival
far
reaching
in
its
influence
and
results
so
the
denominational
papers
had
it
from
judge
report
written
while
the
services
were
still
in
progress
and
edited
by
the
evangelist
and
the
papers
published
a
greater
truth
than
they
knew
there
were
influences
of
which
they
were
ignorant
and
the
results
reached
ends
they
dreamed
not
of
night
after
night
dan
heard
the
evangelist
with
harsh
words
and
startling
roughness
of
expression
declare
the
awful
eternal
disaster
that
would
befall
every
soul
that
did
not
accept
the
peculiar
brand
of
salvation
which
he
and
his
church
alone
offered
he
listened
to
the
long
arguments
planned
to
prove
the
rightness
and
therefore
righteousness
of
the
evangelist
himself
and
his
denominational
way
and
the
equal
wrongness
and
therefore
unrighteousness
of
every
other
minister
and
church
not
of
his
way
then
as
he
heard
these
utterances
most
emphatically
and
enthusiastically
indorsed
by
his
elders
and
people
as
the
old
jerusalem
gospel
the
conviction
grew
upon
him
that
his
preaching
would
never
be
acceptable
to
memorial
church
and
what
place
is
there
in
the
scheme
of
things
as
they
are
for
the
unacceptable
preaching
of
any
gospel
what
gospel
can
a
preacher
deliver
in
order
to
be
acceptable
to
his
peculiar
church
save
that
peculiar
gospel
dan
was
not
one
to
ask
the
oft
repeated
question
of
the
ministry
what
must
i
preach
in
order
that
i
may
be
saved
in
the
workers
meetings
in
the
still
more
private
planning
of
the
committees
in
the
jubilant
reports
of
the
uneasiness
of
the
other
churches
and
in
the
satisfying
accounts
of
the
awakened
opposition
and
answering
sermons
of
the
other
preachers
in
the
evidence
of
the
general
stirring
up
of
the
community
and
in
the
schemes
for
further
advertising
and
boosting
the
evangelist
and
the
cause
dan
felt
himself
growing
ever
more
and
more
out
of
harmony
felt
himself
more
and
more
alone
in
those
days
the
sadness
of
his
face
grew
fixed
his
color
lost
its
healthy
freshness
strange
lines
that
did
not
belong
to
his
young
manhood
appeared
and
the
brown
eyes
that
were
wont
to
look
at
you
so
openly
hopefully
expectantly
with
laughter
in
their
depths
were
now
doubting
questioning
fearful
full
of
pain
the
doctor
saw
and
silently
stood
by
harry
saw
and
wished
that
it
was
all
over
then
came
a
letter
from
the
officials
of
the
chicago
church
of
which
dr
miles
was
a
member
the
letter
asked
if
dan
would
consider
a
call
to
that
congregation
again
and
again
dan
read
the
letter
what
should
he
do
he
could
not
stay
in
corinth
the
sense
of
failure
haunted
him
while
he
was
unable
to
fix
upon
the
reason
for
it
he
condemned
himself
for
committing
unknown
offenses
could
he
honestly
go
to
another
church
how
should
he
answer
the
letter
he
could
not
answer
it
at
once
perhaps
in
a
few
days
while
he
hesitated
the
meeting
drew
to
its
triumphant
close
after
one
last
mighty
farewell
effort
the
evangelist
departed
to
some
other
grand
harvest
of
souls
to
some
other
church
that
needed
setting
in
order
his
work
was
well
done
so
well
done
that
he
was
justified
perhaps
in
making
another
substantial
increase
in
his
stated
weekly
terms
that
night
when
the
farewell
meeting
was
over
and
the
last
and
god
bless
you
had
been
said
to
the
evangelist
dan
stood
alone
in
his
study
by
the
window
that
looked
out
upon
denny
garden
he
was
very
tired
never
before
in
his
life
had
he
known
such
weariness
he
felt
that
in
the
past
few
weeks
he
had
neglected
the
garden
down
there
for
denny
and
deborah
he
had
planned
that
the
little
plot
of
ground
should
be
more
profitable
that
year
than
it
had
ever
been
before
he
would
not
neglect
it
longer
there
at
least
were
visible
actual
returns
for
his
labor
tomorrow
he
would
spend
in
the
garden
but
seating
himself
at
his
writing
table
he
wrote
the
chicago
church
that
he
could
not
consider
their
call
and
then
in
that
little
room
where
he
had
made
for
his
ministry
the
supreme
sacrifice
of
his
life
surrounded
by
the
silent
witnesses
of
his
struggle
and
victory
he
penned
his
resignation
as
the
pastor
of
memorial
church
dan
matthews
will
never
outlive
the
suffering
of
that
hour
he
had
lost
the
woman
he
loved
with
all
the
might
of
his
strong
passionate
manhood
when
she
had
waited
and
beckoned
him
to
come
he
had
chosen
his
ministry
and
now
god
pity
him
now
he
had
lost
that
for
which
he
had
sacrificed
both
himself
and
the
woman
he
loved
when
he
had
finished
his
letter
he
bowed
his
face
in
his
hands
and
wept

sir
rising
early
the
next
morning
dan
looked
from
his
window
to
see
a
stranger
already
at
work
in
the
garden
he
was
tall
having
the
figure
and
dress
of
a
laborer
a
few
minutes
later
dan
was
introduced
by
the
delighted
deborah
to
her
brother

arrived

mortgage
in
good
hard
cash
explainin
to
him
d
see
that
i
wanted
the
papers
all
fixed
up
straight
and
clear
and
turned
over
to
debby
here
as
a
kind
of
a
surprise
d
see
after
i
was
gone
an
she
would
be
bein
left
by
her
man
and
me
besides
the
judge
bein
as
i
knew
the
main
guy
in
the
big
church
i
niver
thought
but
that
be
all
right
d
see
well
sir
i
went
away
that
very
day
as
tickled
as
a
boy
over
the
thing
an
niver
thought
nothin
about
not
gettin
a
letter
about
it
from
her
ye
see
wid
me
on
the
move
so
most
of
the
letters
i
git
from
debby
niver
find
me
at
all
an
here
she
tillin
me
now
that
she
niver
heard
nothin

from
the
judge
an
she
been
the
interest
right
along
an
would
a
been
turned
out
by
him
if
it
a
bin
fer
you
sir
an
me
wid
no
writin
nor
nothin
to
show
for
the
good
money
i
paid
him
now
ai
that
a
hell
of
a
thing
sir
what
kin
i
do
save
bate
the
face
off
him
onless
he
fixes
it
up
right
an
gives
back
ivery
cint
he
had
off
her
besides
as
he
listened
to
the
irishman
story
the
new
drawn
lines
in
face
deepened
he
sat
with
bowed
head
as
though
he
himself
were
being
charged
with
theft
when
the
tale
was
finished
there
was
silence
in
the
little
room
for
several
minutes
then
dan
raised
his
head
and
the
others
saw
that
in
his
eyes
as
though
he
had
received
a
mortal
hurt
tell
me
mcgowan
he
said
are
you
sure
there
is
not
some
mistake
somewhere
it
is
very
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
an
elder
of
the
church
would
his
voice
broke
the
irishman
rough
tones
were
softened
as
he
answered
an
how
could
there
be
any
mistake
sir
wid
me
givin
him
the
hard
cash
out
of
me
own
pocket
after
his
tellin
me
how
much
it
was
an
his
promise
to
fix
it
up
all
right
fer
debby
when
i
explained
the
surprise
i
meant
fer
her
you
paid
him
the
money
you
say
that
i
did
sir
gold
ye
see
i
happened
to
have
that
draft
jest
a
thousand
an
i
turned
it
in
here
at
the
bank
i
remember
how
the
feller
at
the
winder
tried
to
make
me
take
thim
dirty
bills
an
i
would
not
as
neither
would
you
if
you
lived
as
long
in
the
west
as
i
have
sir
got
used
to
the
good
clean
gold
the
gold
or
nothin
i
says
i
to
him
money
to
pay
a
clean
debt
an
we
had
some
words
over
it
his
bein
on
the
other
side
o
the
winder
ye
see
where
he
could
talk
to
me
an
even
eight
hundred
and
fifty
i
gave
the
judge
one
hundred
and
forty
i
paid
the
undertaker
and
the
other
tin
i
gave
to
denny
here
as
i
was
leavin
the
priest
i
paid
out
of
some
i
had
in
me
belt
come
said
dan
we
must
go
to
the
bank
in
the
rear
room
of
the
little
country
bank
dan
introduced
the
irishman
to
the
cashier
colonel
dunwood
i
think
i
have
met
mcgowan
before
said
the
colonel
with
a
smile
mulhall
brother
are
you
not
you
were
here
when
jack
was
killed
i
was
sir
glad
to
meet
you
again
sir
do
you
remember
cashing
a
draft
for
mcgowan
colonel
asked
dan
the
banker
laughed
heartily
i
should
say
i
did
a
thousand
dollars
in
gold
i
was
glad
the
counter
was
between
us
when
i
tried
to
persuade
him
to
take
paper
why
sir
not
in
twenty
years
in
this
state
would
you
find
a
man
who
would
even
accept
the
gold
let
alone
fighting
for
it
then
dan
explained
briefly
the
situation
when
he
had
finished
the
colonel
sprang
to
his
feet
with
an
oath
and
that
explains
something
that
puzzled
us
here
in
the
bank
for
many
a
day
wait
a
minute
he
left
the
room
to
return
with
a
slip
of
paper
can
you
tell
me
the
exact
date
on
which
you
cashed
the
draft
he
said
to
mcgowan
it
was
the
day
after
the
funeral
i
disremember
the
date
but
be
easy
to
find
the
banker
nodded
our
books
show
that
i
paid
you
the
money
the
sixteenth
and
here
he
laid
the
slip
of
paper
before
them
is
a
deposit
slip
made
out
and
signed
by
judge
strong
dated
the
seventeenth
showing
that
on
that
date
he
deposited
eight
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
in
gold
that
is
what
puzzled
us
matthews
that
the
judge
should
deposit
that
amount
of
gold
there
being
you
see
so
little
gold
handled
here
it
makes
it
very
easy
to
trace
i
illustrate
he
turned
to
mike
did
you
spend
any
more
of
the
gold
in
corinth
mcgowan
told
him
about
paying
the
undertaker
after
a
moment
the
colonel
triumphantly
laid
before
them
a
deposit
slip
made
out
by
the
undertaker
dated
a
day
later
showing
an
item
of
one
hundred
and
forty
dollars
in
gold
you
see
he
said
how
easy
it
is
colonel
dunwood
said
dan
would
this
be
sufficient
evidence
before
a
jury
to
he
hesitated
the
colonel
let
fly
another
oath
yes
sir
and
before
any
jury
you
could
get
together
in
this
county
it
would
take
half
this
to
send
that
damned
sniveling
hypocrite
where
he
belongs
he
is
one
of
our
best
customers
too
but
i
reckon
this
bank
can
get
along
without
his
dirty
money
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
forgot
he
is
an
elder
in
your
church
dan
smiled
sadly
i
fear
it
is
more
his
church
than
mine
sir
and
they
left
the
banker
to
puzzle
over
the
minister
remark
that
evening
dan
went
again
to
the
home
of
judge
strong
he
had
persuaded
mcgowan
to
let
him
act
in
the
matter
for
he
feared
that
the
temper
would
complicate
things
and
make
it
more
difficult
to
secure
deborah
rights
by
creating
some
feeling
in
the
community
against
the
little
family
dan
found
the
judge
in
his
library
very
quietly
sadly
indeed
he
told
the
story
the
elder
righteously
indignant
stormed
at
the
minister
denying
everything
accusing
dan
of
being
an
impudent
meddler
threatening
him
with
dismissal
from
the
church
and
the
denomination
accusing
him
even
with
unlawful
interest
in
the
affairs
of
the
widow
and
taunting
him
with
the
common
reports
as
to
his
relations
with
miss
farwell
and
her
companion
dan
with
a
look
of
sadness
growing
deeper
on
his
face
listened
without
a
word
until
the
final
insinuation
then
he
checked
the
other
sharply
and
his
voice
had
the
ring
of
metal
in
it
as
he
said
slowly
judge
strong
you
shall
answer
to
me
later
for
this
insult
to
these
good
women
just
now
you
will
not
mention
them
again
i
am
here
in
the
interests
of
mcgowan
confine
your
remarks
to
that
subject
then
he
laid
before
the
judge
the
evidence
he
had
obtained
at
the
bank
and
pointed
out
its
damaging
strength
the
man
was
frightened
now
but
still
he
obstinately
denied
having
received
any
money
in
payment
of
the
mortgage
dan
pleaded
with
him
urging
even
the
cause
of
the
church
telling
also
how
mcgowan
had
agreed
to
do
nothing
further
if
the
judge
would
simply
make
restitution
the
judge
answered
arrogantly
that
he
had
been
a
faithful
member
and
an
elder
in
the
memorial
church
too
long
to
be
harmed
by
the
charges
of
a
stranger
a
wandering
ruffian
who
had
nothing
but
his
word
to
show
that
he
had
paid
him
a
sum
of
money
and
as
for
you
young
man
he
added
i
may
as
well
tell
you
now
that
your
time
is
about
up
in
corinth
and
i
take
mighty
good
care
that
you
do
get
another
church
in
our
brotherhood
either
i
show
you
that
preachers
get
along
better
when
they
attend
to
their
own
affairs
dan
final
words
as
he
stood
by
the
door
were
i
can
not
believe
judge
strong
that
you
will
force
my
friends
to
take
this
matter
into
the
courts
but
we
will
certainly
do
so
if
i
do
not
receive
from
you
by
tomorrow
noon
the
proper
papers
and
a
check
for
every
cent
you
have
taken
from
mrs
mulhall
until
late
in
the
night
after
dan
departure
judge
strong
still
sat
at
his
desk
deep
in
thought
occasionally
he
rose
to
walk
the
floor
when
the
judge
had
received
that
money
from
mcgowan
he
had
had
no
thought
but
regret
at
losing
the
property
he
coveted
with
deborah
and
denny
left
alone
in
the
world
he
knew
that
in
time
the
place
would
be
sure
to
come
to
him
he
had
only
to
wait
this
wild
irish
and
who
knows
what
beside
who
was
he
to
block
the
elder
plans
with
his
handful
of
gold
the
gold
how
well
the
judge
remembered
that
day
and
how
when
mike
was
gone
he
had
sat
contemplating
the
shining
pieces
what
a
fool
the
man
was
to
carry
such
stuff
on
his
person
the
careful
judge
never
dreamed
that
the
money
had
come
from
his
own
bank
the
irishman
was
going
away
on
the
morrow
planning
gleefully
to
surprise
his
sister
he
had
told
no
one
he
would
wander
far
it
would
be
years
before
he
would
return
if
he
ever
came
back
by
that
time
the
property
would
be
it
was
seemingly
all
too
easy
the
judge
character
was
not
a
character
to
resist
such
an
opportunity
the
gold
alone
perhaps
would
not
have
won
but
the
gold
and
the
place
the
place
he
had
planned
for
and
felt
so
certain
of
owning
that
was
too
much
and
now
this
big
preacher
the
irishman
again
and
the
bank
the
more
the
judge
thought
over
dan
quiet
words
the
more
he
saw
the
danger
so
it
came
about
that
the
next
morning
dan
waiting
in
his
study
received
a
visitor
the
good
old
elder
nathaniel
jordan
chapter
xxxix
the
victory
of
the
ally
so
the
old
doctor
found
him
in
the
late
afternoon
his
great
strength
shaken
by
rage
and
doubt
found
him
struggling
like
a
beast
in
the
trap
nathaniel
was
greatly
agitated
as
he
faced
the
minister
in
the
doorway
he
moved
unsteadily
across
the
room
stumbling
toward
the
chair
dan
offered
and
his
hand
shook
so
violently
that
his
cane
rattled
against
the
window
ledge
where
he
attempted
to
lay
it
rattled
and
fell
to
the
floor
he
jumped
in
his
seat
at
the
sound
dan
picked
up
the
cane
and
placed
it
on
the
table
then
the
elder
found
his
voice
thin
and
trembling
and
said
i
came
about
about
brother
strong
you
know
yes
said
dan
a
great
pity
for
this
good
old
man
in
his
heart
did
judge
strong
send
anything
the
elder
fumbled
in
his
pocket
and
drew
out
an
envelope
he
extended
it
with
shaking
fingers
to
dan
who
opened
it
and
examined
the
contents
slowly
he
replaced
them
in
the
envelope
and
looking
at
his
visitor
waited
again
the
elder
found
his
voice
and
said
with
a
little
more
a
bad
business
brother
matthews
too
bad
too
bad
poor
brother
strong
he
shook
his
head
sadly
dan
looked
at
him
curiously
but
made
no
reply
poor
brother
strong
the
elder
repeated
brother
matthews
i
want
to
ask
you
to
use
your
influence
with
these
people
to
keep
this
sad
affair
from
getting
out
do
you
think
they
will
insist
on
ah
on
bringing
action
against
brother
strong
now
now
that
he
has
ah
complied
with
your
request
and
why
asked
dan
should
you
wish
the
matter
kept
secret
the
elder
gazed
at
him
blankly
why
why
on
account
of
the
church
of
course
judge
strong
is
one
of
our
leading
members
an
elder
he
has
been
for
years
it
would
ruin
us
ruin
us
but
said
dan
coolly
he
is
a
thief
you
must
know
that
he
stole
this
money
here
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
holding
the
envelope
here
is
his
confession
of
guilt
the
elder
voice
trembled
again
brother
matthews
brother
matthews
i
i
protest
such
language
applied
to
an
elder
is
unchristian
you
know
the
scripture
is
it
not
true
persisted
dan
ahem
brother
strong
may
have
made
a
mistake
may
ah
have
done
wrong
but
the
church
the
church
we
must
think
of
the
good
name
of
the
cause
coming
so
soon
after
the
revival
too
am
i
to
understand
then
that
the
church
will
keep
this
man
in
his
place
as
an
elder
that
you
will
protect
him
when
you
know
his
true
character
at
the
question
the
other
stared
blankly
why
why
how
could
we
get
along
without
him
how
can
you
get
along
with
him
asked
dan
but
there
is
a
man
in
corinth
who
has
done
so
much
for
us
and
for
the
missionary
cause
no
no
we
must
be
more
careful
brother
matthews
then
for
the
sake
of
his
contributions
and
his
position
in
the
community
the
church
will
shield
him
from
the
results
of
his
crime
the
elder
squirmed
uneasily
in
his
chair
is
that
what
you
mean
insisted
dan
why
i
i
do
think
brother
matthews
for
the
good
of
our
cause
in
corinth
that
it
would
be
good
policy
to
make
this
matter
public
and
so
create
a
great
stir
brother
strong
has
made
restitution
we
must
be
charitable
brother
and
forgiving
you
must
not
think
too
too
hard
of
him
are
these
people
determined
to
push
this
matter
oh
no
said
dan
not
at
all
they
want
only
that
which
belongs
to
them
you
may
rest
easy
as
i
told
the
judge
last
night
this
will
end
the
matter
it
was
under
that
promise
that
he
made
restitution
as
you
call
it
i
was
simply
asking
to
know
how
the
church
would
look
upon
such
a
thing
when
it
touches
an
elder
you
have
explained
it
clearly
the
elder
stiffened
it
was
remarkable
how
quickly
he
revived
under
assurance
that
the
danger
was
past
very
dignified
now
as
became
one
in
his
position
he
said
ahem
ahem
i
fear
brother
matthews
that
you
are
not
ah
not
entirely
in
harmony
with
our
brotherhood
in
many
things
dan
was
silent
ahem
the
tone
of
your
sermons
has
been
i
may
say
ah
questioned
by
a
good
many
of
us
and
your
attitude
toward
the
board
has
not
been
quite
as
cordial
as
we
feel
we
have
a
right
to
expect
do
you
speak
from
personal
experience
sir
oh
no
no
indeed
brother
matthews
but
ah
brother
strong
has
felt
for
some
time
past
that
you
have
treated
him
rather
coldly
dan
waited
a
lack
of
harmony
between
a
pastor
and
his
elder
is
very
bad
ah
very
bad
ahem
ahem
and
so
considering
everything
we
brother
str
that
is
the
board
have
thought
best
that
your
relations
with
the
memorial
church
should
discontinue
and
when
was
this
action
taken
asked
dan
quietly
the
day
before
the
meetings
closed
we
wished
to
have
the
benefit
of
brother
sigman
advice
before
he
left
he
met
with
us
and
we
considered
the
whole
matter
quite
carefully
and
prayerfully
i
was
appointed
to
tell
you
i
should
add
that
there
is
no
doubt
but
the
people
will
concur
in
the
board
decision
many
of
the
members
i
may
say
were
seen
before
we
took
action
dan
glanced
toward
his
desk
where
in
the
envelopes
lay
his
resignation
and
his
answer
to
the
chicago
church
in
the
excitement
of
trouble
he
had
neglected
to
mail
them
of
course
he
questioned
quietly
curious
now
the
board
will
give
me
a
letter
ahem
we
ah
discussed
that
also
said
the
elder
brother
strong
and
the
evangelist
and
i
may
say
the
entire
board
feel
that
we
can
not
consistently
do
so
may
i
ask
why
ahem
your
teaching
brother
matthews
does
not
seem
to
be
in
harmony
with
the
brotherhood
we
can
not
endorse
it
and
the
talk
in
the
community
about
your
conduct
has
been
very
damaging
very
is
it
charged
that
my
teaching
has
been
false
to
the
principles
of
christianity
as
taught
by
christ
i
can
not
discuss
that
part
brother
matthews
it
is
not
such
teaching
as
the
churches
of
our
brotherhood
want
does
the
church
sir
believe
that
my
character
is
bad
no
sir
no
sir
no
one
really
believes
that
but
you
have
been
ah
injudicious
there
has
been
so
much
talk
you
know
who
has
talked
dan
interrupted
the
elder
continued
these
things
follow
a
minister
all
his
life
we
can
not
recommend
a
man
of
bad
repute
to
our
sister
churches
it
would
reflect
upon
us
for
the
same
reason
that
you
keep
in
a
high
office
in
the
church
a
man
who
is
an
unrepentant
thief
said
dan
the
elder
rose
really
brother
matthews
i
can
not
listen
to
such
words
about
our
elder
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
dan
huskily
i
was
thinking
aloud
please
tell
me
one
thing
more
i
have
here
a
letter
from
a
church
in
chicago
asking
me
to
consider
a
call
have
the
elders
received
a
letter
from
them
ahem
yes
we
considered
it
at
that
same
meeting
and
you
have
written
them
we
could
not
recommend
you
i
am
sorry
brother
matthews
i
believe
you
are
said
dan
slowly
thank
you
when
the
elder
was
gone
dan
turned
sadly
back
to
his
little
study
the
study
that
had
come
to
stand
so
for
everything
to
which
he
had
devoted
his
life
with
such
holy
purpose
for
which
he
had
sacrificed
so
much
slowly
he
went
to
his
desk
and
looked
down
upon
the
work
scattered
over
it
taking
up
the
two
letters
he
tore
them
slowly
into
fragments
and
dropped
them
into
the
waste
basket
then
as
slowly
he
turned
to
his
books
touching
many
of
the
familiar
volumes
with
a
caressing
hand
then
he
went
to
the
table
where
lay
his
church
papers
and
the
missionary
pamphlets
and
reports
the
envelope
from
judge
strong
caught
his
eye
mechanically
he
took
his
hat
and
went
to
carry
the
message
to
his
friends
on
the
other
side
of
the
garden
from
across
the
street
the
old
doctor
hailed
him
but
he
did
not
hear
delivering
the
envelope
with
a
few
brief
words
the
minister
left
his
friends
and
wandered
on
down
the
street
in
a
bewildered
dazed
fashion
scarce
knowing
where
he
went
or
why
until
he
turned
in
through
the
gap
in
the
fence
to
the
old
academy
yard
but
he
could
not
stay
there
the
place
was
haunted
he
could
not
stay
he
turned
his
face
toward
the
open
country
but
the
fields
and
woodlands
had
no
call
for
him
that
day
it
was
his
little
study
that
called
his
books
his
work
as
one
goes
to
sit
beside
the
body
of
a
dear
friend
conscious
that
the
friend
he
loved
is
not
there
yet
unable
to
leave
the
form
wherein
the
spirit
had
lived
so
dan
went
back
to
his
room
his
desk
his
books
his
papers
that
which
had
been
his
work
and
now
the
deep
passions
of
the
man
stirred
themselves
awoke
wild
anger
mad
rage
seized
and
shook
him
his
whole
sense
of
justice
was
outraged
this
was
not
christianity
this
thing
that
had
caught
him
in
its
foul
snare
and
if
the
church
was
not
christian
what
was
christianity
was
there
indeed
such
a
thing
was
it
all
such
a
hollow
mockery
so
the
doctor
found
him
in
the
late
afternoon
his
great
strength
shaken
by
rage
and
doubt
found
him
struggling
like
a
beast
in
the
trap
and
the
doctor
saw
that
the
hour
for
which
he
had
waited
had
come
dan
needed
him
needed
him
badly
chapter
xl
the
doctor
glasses
is
no
hatred
lad
so
bitter
as
that
hatred
born
of
a
religious
love
no
falsehood
so
vile
as
the
lie
spoken
in
defense
of
truth
no
wrong
so
harmful
as
the
wrong
committed
in
the
name
of
righteousness
no
injustice
so
terrible
as
the
injustice
of
those
who
condemn
in
the
name
of
the
saviour
of
the
world
when
dan
forced
into
something
of
his
habitual
and
calmness
by
the
presence
of
his
old
friend
began
telling
the
doctor
of
the
action
of
the
church
the
other
checked
him
abruptly
with
i
know
all
about
that
lad
you
know
ejaculated
dan
certainly
i
know
is
martha
one
of
the
elect
i
reckon
everybody
in
the
whole
town
but
you
knew
it
before
noon
of
the
day
after
the
meeting
dan
muttered
something
about
being
a
blind
fool
and
the
old
doctor
answered
humph
the
fools
are
they
who
see
too
much
boy
such
blindness
as
yours
is
a
gift
of
the
gods
for
heaven
sake
do
let
any
quack
fit
you
out
with
glasses
dan
threw
himself
wearily
into
a
chair
and
there
was
a
spirit
of
recklessness
in
his
reply
as
though
he
were
letting
go
of
himself
again
how
is
a
blind
man
to
recognize
a
quack
i
would
to
god
i
had
your
glasses
perhaps
said
the
doctor
deliberately
i
might
lend
them
to
you
just
for
once
you
know
well
then
said
the
other
sitting
up
suddenly
let
me
have
them
how
do
you
see
this
thing
what
have
i
done
or
not
done
for
what
shall
i
blame
myself
what
fatal
error
have
i
made
that
with
the
best
of
motives
with
the
he
hesitated
then
i
can
say
it
to
you
doctor
and
i
will
with
the
sacrifice
of
the
dearest
thing
in
the
world
to
me
i
am
cast
out
in
this
fashion
if
i
can
find
a
reason
for
it
i
can
bear
it
it
is
your
blindness
boy
you
could
not
help
it
you
were
born
blind
i
have
always
known
this
would
come
you
have
always
known
this
would
come
repeated
dan
questioningly
yes
i
have
always
known
because
for
half
a
century
boy
i
have
observed
the
spirit
of
this
institution
mind
i
do
not
say
the
spirit
of
the
people
in
the
institution
strong
people
dan
sometimes
manage
to
live
in
mighty
sickly
climates
the
best
people
in
the
world
are
sometimes
held
by
evil
circumstances
which
their
own
best
intentions
have
created
the
people
in
the
church
are
the
salt
of
the
earth
if
it
were
not
for
their
goodness
the
system
would
have
rotted
long
ago
the
church
for
all
its
talk
does
save
the
people
the
people
save
the
church
and
let
me
tell
you
dan
the
very
ones
in
the
church
who
have
done
the
things
you
have
seen
and
felt
at
heart
respect
and
believe
in
you
dan
broke
forth
in
such
a
laugh
as
the
doctor
had
never
heard
from
his
lips
then
why
because
said
the
old
man
it
is
their
religion
to
worship
an
institution
not
a
god
to
serve
a
system
not
the
race
it
is
history
my
boy
every
reformation
begins
with
the
persecution
of
the
reformer
and
ends
with
the
followers
of
that
reformer
persecuting
those
who
would
lead
them
another
step
toward
freedom
misguided
religious
people
have
always
crucified
their
saviors
and
always
will
dan
was
silent
awed
by
the
revelation
of
his
old
friend
mind
presently
the
doctor
continued
there
is
no
hatred
lad
so
bitter
as
that
hatred
born
of
a
religious
love
no
falsehood
so
vile
as
the
lie
spoken
in
defense
of
truth
no
wrong
so
harmful
as
the
wrong
committed
in
the
name
of
righteousness
no
injustice
so
terrible
as
the
injustice
of
those
who
condemn
in
the
name
of
the
saviour
of
the
world
what
then
as
you
see
it
what
can
i
do
demanded
dan
the
doctor
changed
his
tone
his
reply
was
more
a
question
than
an
answer
there
are
other
churches
dan
laughed
bitterly
they
have
taken
care
of
that
too
he
began
to
tell
of
the
call
to
chicago
and
the
elders
refusal
to
give
him
a
letter
but
again
the
doctor
interrupted
him
yes
i
know
about
that
too
well
demanded
dan
almost
angrily
well
answered
the
other
easily
there
are
still
other
churches
you
mean
i
mean
that
you
are
not
the
only
preacher
who
has
been
talked
about
by
his
church
and
branded
by
his
official
board
with
the
mark
of
the
devil
in
the
name
of
the
lord
it
easy
enough
go
farther
get
a
little
obscure
congregation
somewhere
stay
long
enough
to
get
a
letter
not
long
enough
to
make
another
name
try
another
in
the
same
fashion
lay
low
keep
quiet
stay
away
from
conventions
watch
your
chance
and
when
the
time
is
ripe
make
a
hit
with
the
state
workers
in
some
other
state
you
know
how
it
all
easy
enough
dan
leaped
to
his
feet
good
god
doctor
i
have
done
nothing
wrong
why
should
i
skulk
and
hide
and
scheme
to
conceal
something
i
never
did
for
the
privilege
of
serving
a
church
that
does
want
me
is
this
the
ministry
it
seems
to
be
a
large
part
of
it
answered
the
other
deliberately
my
boy
it
the
things
that
preachers
have
not
done
that
they
try
hardest
to
hide
as
to
why
i
must
confess
that
i
am
a
little
myself
sometimes
i
ca
i
ca
do
it
doctor
humph
i
did
suppose
you
could
came
dryly
from
the
old
man
dan
did
not
heed
but
went
on
in
a
hopeless
tone
to
tell
the
doctor
how
he
had
written
his
resignation
and
had
declined
to
consider
the
call
to
chicago
do
you
see
that
i
could
take
a
church
if
one
were
offered
me
now
he
asked
do
you
understand
what
this
has
done
for
me
not
the
false
charges
it
not
that
it
it
the
thing
whatever
it
is
that
has
made
this
action
of
the
church
possible
i
am
forced
to
doubt
not
alone
the
church
but
everything
the
people
myself
god
christ
christianity
life
itself
everything
how
can
i
go
on
with
a
work
in
which
i
can
not
say
to
myself
with
truth
that
i
believe
his
voice
ended
in
a
groan
and
the
old
man
who
knew
the
lad
so
well
felt
as
though
he
were
gazing
upon
the
big
naked
soul
then
indeed
the
doctor
knew
that
the
hour
had
come
there
are
those
who
capable
of
giving
but
little
to
life
demand
of
life
much
in
return
to
such
weak
natures
doubt
means
not
much
but
souls
like
this
one
capable
of
giving
themselves
to
the
last
atom
of
their
strength
demand
no
small
returns
in
convictions
as
to
the
worthiness
of
the
cause
to
which
they
contribute
to
such
doubt
is
destruction
it
was
because
dan
had
believed
so
strongly
so
wholly
in
the
ministry
of
the
church
that
he
had
failed
had
he
not
accepted
so
unreservedly
and
given
himself
so
completely
to
the
ministry
as
it
was
presented
to
him
in
theory
had
he
in
some
degree
doubted
he
would
have
been
able
to
adjust
himself
to
the
actual
conditions
he
would
have
succeeded
for
while
theoretically
the
strength
of
the
church
is
in
its
fidelity
to
the
things
in
which
it
professes
to
believe
practically
and
actually
the
strength
of
the
church
of
today
is
in
its
tacit
acceptance
of
its
unbeliefs
strange
things
would
befall
us
if
we
should
ever
get
the
habit
of
insisting
that
our
practice
square
with
our
preaching
if
churches
should
make
this
the
test
of
fellowship
that
men
must
live
their
doctrines
rather
than
teach
them
that
they
must
live
their
beliefs
rather
than
confess
them
that
they
must
live
their
faiths
rather
than
profess
them
dan
was
not
a
nature
that
could
preach
things
in
which
he
only
half
believed
to
a
people
whose
belief
he
knew
to
be
no
stronger
than
his
own
it
was
with
these
things
in
mind
that
the
doctor
had
waited
for
this
moment
in
dan
life
for
the
old
man
realized
as
the
young
man
could
not
what
such
moments
mean
rising
and
going
to
the
window
overlooking
the
garden
the
doctor
called
to
dan
come
here
boy
together
they
stood
looking
down
on
the
little
plot
of
ground
with
its
growing
vegetables
where
denny
with
his
helpless
swinging
arm
and
twisted
dragging
foot
was
digging
away
his
cheery
whistle
floating
up
to
them
the
physician
spoke
with
a
depth
of
feeling
he
had
never
betrayed
before
while
dan
troubled
as
he
was
listened
in
wonder
to
his
friend
who
had
always
been
so
reticent
in
matters
such
as
this
dan
he
said
you
wished
for
my
glasses
is
always
a
mighty
dangerous
thing
to
try
to
see
through
another
man
eyes
but
here
are
mine
he
pointed
below
down
there
i
see
religion
christianity
what
you
will
but
religion
living
growing
through
the
lying
dormant
sometimes
it
may
be
but
always
there
yielding
to
each
season
the
things
that
belong
to
that
season
depending
for
its
strength
and
power
upon
the
great
source
of
all
strength
and
power
depending
as
truly
upon
man
efforts
upon
his
cultivation
and
care
there
is
variety
harmony
law
freedom
there
is
god
something
for
all
potatoes
peas
turnips
cabbage
if
you
do
not
care
for
lettuce
perhaps
radishes
will
satisfy
and
there
boy
in
the
midst
of
his
church
ministering
to
the
needs
of
his
congregation
and
thus
ministering
to
men
is
my
minister
crippled
patient
denny
who
gives
his
frail
strength
to
keep
the
garden
growing
and
look
you
boy
at
the
great
rock
in
the
very
center
of
the
field
how
often
denny
has
wished
it
out
of
his
way
i
caught
the
poor
lad
digging
one
time
to
find
if
he
could
how
deep
it
is
in
the
earth
and
how
big
for
three
days
i
watched
him
then
he
gave
it
up
it
is
beyond
his
strength
and
he
wisely
turned
to
devote
his
energies
to
the
productive
soil
around
it
there
is
a
rock
in
every
garden
dan
religion
grows
always
about
the
unknowable
but
denny
ministry
has
naught
to
do
with
the
rock
it
has
to
do
with
the
growing
things
about
it
so
religion
is
in
the
knowable
things
not
in
the
unknowable
there
such
men
as
you
lad
must
find
it
and
the
rock
boy
was
not
put
in
the
garden
by
men
it
belongs
to
the
earth
itself
while
the
doctor
was
speaking
his
eyes
had
been
fixed
on
the
crippled
boy
in
the
garden
he
turned
now
for
the
first
time
to
face
the
young
man
by
his
side
dan
eyes
had
that
wide
questioning
look
the
old
physician
moved
to
the
other
window
now
come
see
what
men
have
done
he
pointed
to
the
monument
these
people
will
tell
you
that
was
erected
to
commemorate
the
life
of
my
friend
his
was
a
warm
tender
loving
spirit
a
great
soul
what
can
that
hard
cold
immovable
mass
tell
of
him
how
can
that
thing
perpetuating
an
issue
that
belongs
to
a
past
age
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
life
of
today
how
can
that
thing
speak
of
the
great
heart
that
loved
and
gave
itself
always
to
men
through
my
glasses
that
is
the
church
how
can
an
institution
or
a
system
of
theological
beliefs
with
prejudices
fidelity
to
issues
long
past
and
forgotten
unconcern
of
vital
issues
of
the
life
of
today
and
want
of
sympathy
with
the
living
who
toil
and
fight
and
die
on
every
side
how
can
such
speak
the
great
loving
sympathetic
helpful
spirit
of
him
whose
name
only
it
bears
as
that
bears
only
the
name
of
my
friend
but
would
the
people
of
this
town
out
of
love
for
my
dead
friend
tear
down
that
monument
if
denny
should
leave
his
garden
to
argue
with
them
about
it
why
they
would
tell
him
that
it
is
because
of
their
love
for
the
statesman
that
they
keep
it
there
and
they
believe
it
and
it
is
true
well
then
let
them
keep
their
monument
and
let
denny
work
in
his
garden
and
do
you
see
dan
that
the
very
ones
who
fight
for
the
monument
must
depend
at
last
for
their
lives
and
strength
upon
the
things
that
denny
grows
in
his
garden
now
boy
that
the
first
and
only
time
i
ever
preached
chapter
xli
the
final
word
closes
my
ministry
as
you
understand
it
it
by
no
means
closes
my
ministry
as
i
have
come
to
understand
it
dan
farewell
sermon
was
to
be
given
in
the
evening
john
gardner
who
true
to
the
promise
he
had
made
when
he
challenged
the
minister
after
that
sermon
on
fellowship
of
service
had
become
a
regular
attendant
was
present
in
the
morning
in
the
afternoon
the
farmer
called
on
dan
in
his
study
look
here
dan
he
said
you
are
making
the
mistake
of
your
life
you
wrong
john
i
made
that
mistake
nearly
two
years
ago
he
answered
i
mean
in
leaving
corinth
as
you
are
leaving
it
and
i
mean
in
coming
to
corinth
as
i
came
to
it
but
wait
a
minute
let
me
tell
you
you
have
done
a
lot
of
good
in
this
town
you
do
know
so
have
you
done
a
lot
of
good
john
you
do
know
either
the
farmer
tried
again
you
have
helped
me
more
than
you
know
i
glad
john
because
you
have
helped
me
more
than
know
oh
come
you
know
what
i
mean
well
do
you
know
what
i
mean
yes
i
think
i
do
i
been
listening
pretty
close
to
your
sermons
and
so
have
a
lot
of
others
i
have
managed
to
talk
with
a
good
many
church
people
since
it
was
known
that
you
were
going
just
common
plugs
in
the
congregation
like
me
you
know
dan
smiled
we
all
understand
what
you
have
been
driving
at
in
your
preaching
and
we
know
pretty
well
what
the
bosses
think
about
it
and
why
they
have
let
you
out
no
one
takes
any
stock
in
that
foul
gossip
not
even
strong
himself
now
what
i
came
to
say
is
this
a
lot
of
us
want
you
to
stay
why
ca
we
have
another
church
for
our
people
right
here
in
corinth
there
enough
of
us
to
back
you
and
we
mean
business
dan
shook
his
head
sadly
thank
you
john
he
said
simply
it
is
useless
for
me
to
try
to
tell
you
how
much
good
this
does
me
but
i
ca
accept
i
have
thought
of
the
possibility
you
mention
but
i
ca
do
it
you
do
not
need
another
church
in
corinth
you
have
more
than
you
need
now
nor
could
any
argument
move
him
well
said
the
farmer
when
at
last
he
gave
it
up
and
rose
to
say
i
suppose
i
keep
right
on
being
a
church
member
but
i
reckon
i
have
to
find
most
of
my
religion
in
my
work
and
that
said
dan
as
he
gripped
his
friend
hand
is
the
best
place
i
know
of
to
look
for
it
if
you
can
not
find
god
in
your
everyday
work
john
you
not
find
him
on
sunday
at
the
church
that
farewell
sermon
is
still
talked
about
in
corinth
or
rather
it
should
be
said
is
still
remembered
for
it
was
one
of
those
sermons
of
which
while
little
could
be
said
much
could
never
be
forgotten
and
the
picture
of
the
big
lad
whose
strong
body
drooped
so
as
if
in
great
weariness
whose
frank
open
countenance
was
marked
with
drawn
lines
in
whose
clear
brown
eyes
were
shadows
of
trouble
and
pain
whose
voice
betrayed
the
sadness
of
a
mighty
soul
will
also
remain
long
in
the
memory
of
those
who
were
there
that
evening
the
place
was
crowded
the
triumphant
judge
and
his
friends
of
the
inner
circle
were
there
in
force
striving
in
vain
to
hide
with
pious
expression
of
countenance
the
satisfaction
and
pride
they
felt
in
their
power
the
other
members
were
there
curious
to
hear
what
dan
would
say
wondering
how
much
he
knew
of
the
methods
that
had
brought
about
his
dismissal
a
little
sorry
for
him
a
little
indignant
and
with
a
feeling
of
impotence
withal
that
made
their
sorrow
and
indignation
of
no
worth
whatever
with
identically
the
same
emotions
as
the
members
except
that
it
felt
free
to
express
them
more
freely
the
world
was
there
to
a
portion
of
the
congregation
dan
stood
in
the
peculiar
position
of
a
friend
whom
as
an
individual
they
loved
and
trusted
but
whom
as
a
preacher
they
were
forced
to
regard
as
unsafe
and
dangerous
it
would
not
do
to
report
all
he
said
for
much
of
his
sermon
was
not
fashioned
for
the
printed
page
but
his
final
words
were
it
is
not
the
spirit
of
wealth
of
learning
or
of
culture
that
can
make
the
church
of
value
or
a
power
for
good
in
the
world
but
the
spirit
of
christ
only
it
is
not
in
fidelity
to
the
past
but
in
fidelity
to
the
present
that
the
church
can
be
christian
it
is
not
the
opinion
of
man
but
the
eternal
truths
of
god
that
can
make
it
a
sacred
holy
thing
it
is
holy
to
the
degree
that
god
is
in
it
god
is
as
truly
in
the
fields
of
grain
in
the
forests
in
the
mines
and
in
those
laws
of
nature
by
which
men
convert
the
product
of
field
and
forest
and
mine
into
the
necessities
of
life
therefore
these
are
as
truly
holy
as
this
institution
therefore
again
the
ministry
of
farm
and
mine
and
factory
and
shop
of
mill
and
railroad
and
store
and
office
and
wherever
men
toil
with
strength
of
body
or
strength
of
mind
for
that
which
makes
for
the
best
life
of
their
kind
that
ministry
is
sacred
and
holy
because
i
believe
these
things
i
am
from
this
hour
no
longer
a
professional
preacher
hired
by
and
working
under
the
direction
of
any
denomination
or
church
leaders
this
closes
my
ministry
as
you
understand
it
it
by
no
means
closes
my
ministry
as
i
have
come
to
understand
it
when
he
had
finished
they
crowded
around
him
to
express
regret
at
his
going
sorry
that
he
was
leaving
the
ministry
the
church
needed
men
of
his
great
ability
prayed
god
to
bless
him
wherever
he
should
go
all
this
and
much
more
with
and
many
tears
from
the
very
people
who
had
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
stay
for
this
is
the
way
of
us
all
as
quickly
as
he
could
dan
left
the
church
and
with
the
doctor
walked
toward
home
the
two
made
no
exchange
of
words
until
they
reached
the
monument
where
they
paused
to
stand
silently
contemplating
the
figure
at
last
dan
turned
with
a
smile
it
is
very
good
i
suppose
doctor
then
as
if
dismissing
the
whole
matter
he
took
his
old
friend
arm
and
with
a
joyous
ring
in
his
voice
that
had
not
been
there
for
many
months
said
doctor
you
do
me
one
favor
before
i
leave
wo
you
what
go
fishing
with
me
tomorrow
there
is
something
still
before
i
can
leave
corinth
i
do
not
know
how
will
you
go
chapter
xlii
justice
the
last
shadow
of
his
corinthian
ministry
had
been
lifted
from
his
soul
early
the
next
morning
dan
and
the
old
doctor
set
out
for
wheeler
ford
it
was
the
nearest
point
and
while
the
fishing
was
not
so
good
as
at
other
places
they
knew
the
spot
was
what
they
wanted
this
was
one
of
the
days
when
they
would
go
fishing
but
not
for
fish
leaving
their
rig
by
the
roadside
near
the
fence
the
two
friends
wandered
away
up
the
stream
casting
their
hooks
now
and
then
at
the
likely
places
taking
a
few
fish
pausing
often
to
enjoy
the
views
of
silver
water
trees
wooded
bluffs
rocky
bank
or
grassy
slope
that
changed
always
with
the
winding
of
the
creek
returning
to
the
rig
for
their
lunch
and
to
give
the
old
horse
his
generous
allowance
they
went
downstream
in
the
afternoon
this
time
leaving
their
rods
behind
really
you
know
said
the
doctor
the
tackle
is
such
a
bother
on
this
kind
of
a
fishing
trip
at
which
sage
remark
dan
laugh
rang
out
so
freely
that
the
woods
on
the
other
side
of
the
little
valley
gave
back
the
merry
sound
dan
felt
strangely
and
free
that
day
the
doctor
thought
the
lad
was
more
like
himself
than
he
had
been
for
months
the
truth
is
that
dan
gladness
was
akin
to
the
gladness
of
he
felt
as
one
who
having
been
for
long
years
in
a
foreign
land
returns
to
his
own
country
and
his
own
people
he
was
again
a
man
among
his
with
no
barrier
between
him
and
his
kind
once
more
he
was
in
the
world
to
which
he
belonged
and
it
was
a
good
world
there
was
too
a
strange
delightful
feeling
of
nearness
to
her
the
woman
he
loved
he
had
had
no
word
since
she
left
corinth
nor
did
he
know
where
she
was
he
would
never
find
her
again
perhaps
but
he
no
longer
belonged
to
a
world
separate
and
apart
from
her
world
he
felt
nearer
to
her
even
than
when
they
were
together
that
last
time
in
the
old
academy
yard
dan
was
conscious
too
of
a
sense
of
freedom
of
a
broader
fuller
life
than
he
had
ever
known
through
the
old
doctor
timely
words
setting
his
thoughts
into
new
channels
he
had
come
out
of
his
painful
experience
with
a
certain
largeness
of
vision
that
made
him
stronger
he
had
found
himself
he
did
not
know
yet
what
he
would
do
he
had
plans
dimly
formed
but
nothing
fixed
what
did
it
matter
somewhere
he
felt
his
garden
waited
for
him
he
would
find
his
work
he
was
free
from
the
deadening
influence
of
the
monument
and
that
for
the
moment
was
enough
so
far
as
his
corinthian
ministry
was
concerned
only
one
shadow
out
of
all
the
dark
cloud
of
his
troubled
experience
remained
when
that
was
lifted
he
would
turn
his
back
upon
corinth
forever
but
until
then
he
did
not
feel
free
to
go
they
were
lying
on
the
grassy
bank
of
a
woodland
pasture
where
a
herd
of
cattle
grazed
or
lay
contentedly
in
the
shade
of
the
scattered
trees
said
the
doctor
i
believe
i
will
go
with
you
lad
for
some
time
they
had
been
silent
and
it
was
almost
as
though
the
old
man
had
spoken
to
his
companion
thoughts
go
where
asked
dan
turning
over
on
his
side
and
himself
on
his
elbow
why
home
to
mutton
hollow
of
course
you
be
leaving
pretty
soon
now
i
reckon
i
suppose
so
mused
dan
vaguely
but
i
not
going
home
the
old
doctor
sat
up
not
going
home
dan
smiled
not
just
yet
he
answered
i
want
to
run
about
a
little
first
the
doctor
nodded
want
to
get
your
hair
dry
and
your
shirt
on
right
side
out
before
you
face
the
folks
dan
laughed
perhaps
i
want
to
look
for
my
garden
he
said
good
ejaculated
the
other
now
very
much
in
earnest
let
me
help
you
lad
you
know
what
i
have
always
hoped
for
you
my
profession
needs
dan
interrupted
gently
no
no
doctor
not
that
i
have
a
notion
but
there
it
all
too
vague
yet
to
even
discuss
when
i
am
ready
to
go
home
i
write
you
and
you
can
meet
me
there
will
you
the
old
man
hid
his
disappointment
answering
heartily
sure
i
will
i
be
there
when
you
arrive
to
help
kill
the
fatted
calf
he
did
not
tell
dan
of
a
letter
from
his
mother
urging
him
for
certain
reasons
to
visit
them
or
that
he
had
already
promised
her
to
be
with
them
when
dan
should
return
the
shadows
were
beginning
to
stretch
toward
the
river
and
the
cattle
were
moving
slowly
in
the
direction
of
the
farmyard
hidden
somewhere
beyond
the
fringe
of
timber
when
the
two
friends
went
leisurely
back
to
the
road
to
find
their
rig
and
start
for
home
climbing
the
fence
they
paused
and
seated
on
the
top
rail
watched
a
team
and
buggy
just
coming
down
the
opposite
bank
of
the
stream
to
cross
the
ford
midway
the
horses
stopped
to
drink
by
george
muttered
the
doctor
it
our
friend
the
judge
the
same
instant
dan
recognized
the
man
in
the
buggy
with
the
recognition
all
the
brightness
went
out
of
his
face
as
a
cloud
all
the
sadness
returned
doctor
dan
said
slipping
down
from
the
fence
as
he
spoke
excuse
me
a
minute
i
must
speak
to
that
man
the
doctor
kept
his
place
on
the
fence
while
dan
stepped
into
the
road
the
team
when
they
had
left
the
ford
stopped
as
they
reached
him
how
do
you
do
doctor
called
the
man
in
the
buggy
in
a
loud
voice
then
to
dan
well
sir
what
do
you
want
now
dan
stood
near
the
horses
heads
his
eyes
fixed
on
their
driver
and
the
judge
seeing
the
sorrow
in
his
face
misunderstood
as
always
judge
strong
said
dan
you
are
the
only
man
in
the
world
with
whom
i
am
not
at
peace
i
can
not
be
content
to
leave
corinth
sir
with
anything
between
us
the
crafty
judge
thought
he
understood
he
took
dan
words
with
his
manner
as
an
acknowledgment
of
defeat
an
act
of
submission
the
elder
had
not
believed
that
the
young
man
had
really
wished
to
leave
the
ministry
he
was
quite
sure
now
that
the
preacher
recognizing
at
last
the
power
that
had
thrust
him
from
his
position
and
place
in
the
church
wished
to
sue
for
peace
that
the
same
power
might
help
him
to
another
position
so
this
big
upstart
was
tamed
at
last
was
he
the
doctor
sitting
on
the
fence
and
hearing
every
word
held
a
different
view
of
the
situation
well
said
the
judge
haughtily
dan
hesitated
i
i
wished
to
ask
a
favor
sir
one
that
i
feel
sure
a
christian
could
not
refuse
now
the
judge
was
confident
of
his
position
and
power
he
grew
still
more
dignified
and
looked
at
dan
with
the
eye
of
a
master
well
out
with
it
it
is
growing
late
and
i
must
be
going
you
will
remember
sir
that
the
last
time
i
called
on
you
in
your
home
you
made
certain
grave
charges
against
three
women
who
are
my
friends
i
repeated
only
the
common
wait
please
interrupted
dan
this
is
a
matter
between
you
and
me
i
understand
that
you
were
angry
and
spoke
hastily
wo
you
please
retract
those
words
now
dan
voice
was
almost
pleading
in
its
sad
slowness
his
eyes
were
on
the
judge
with
an
anxious
appealing
look
disappointed
at
the
request
so
different
from
that
which
he
had
expected
the
judge
angrily
answered
stand
out
of
my
way
i
have
no
time
for
this
sir
but
quietly
carelessly
it
seemed
dan
laid
one
hand
on
the
back
of
the
nearest
horse
almost
touching
the
rein
and
moved
a
step
or
two
closer
to
the
buggy
sir
i
am
sure
you
do
not
understand
miss
farwell
and
i
i
had
hoped
to
make
her
my
wife
we
we
parted
because
of
the
church
the
doctor
on
the
fence
felt
a
lump
in
his
throat
at
the
pain
in
the
boy
voice
dan
continued
i
am
telling
you
sir
so
that
you
will
understand
surely
you
can
not
refuse
to
take
back
your
words
under
the
circumstances
oh
i
see
sneered
the
judge
you
lost
the
girl
because
of
the
church
and
then
you
lost
the
church
a
fine
mess
you
made
of
your
pious
interference
with
other
people
business
did
you
and
then
he
laughed
looking
straight
into
those
sad
pleading
eyes
he
laughed
the
damned
fool
muttered
the
old
doctor
on
the
fence
am
i
to
understand
that
you
refuse
to
retract
your
words
after
my
explanation
dan
tone
was
mildly
doubtful
the
judge
was
well
pleased
at
what
he
had
heard
i
have
absolutely
nothing
to
take
back
sir
he
laughed
again
now
if
that
is
all
stand
aside
but
suddenly
the
light
in
dan
eyes
flashed
red
no
he
cried
that
is
not
all
with
a
long
step
he
reached
the
side
of
the
buggy
the
next
moment
the
judge
found
himself
on
the
ground
wh
what
do
you
mean
sir
he
roared
take
your
hands
off
of
me
dan
voice
was
trembling
with
rage
but
he
spoke
deliberately
you
unspeakable
cur
i
have
felt
sorry
for
you
because
of
your
warped
and
twisted
nature
because
you
seemed
so
incapable
of
being
anything
more
than
you
are
i
have
given
you
a
chance
to
act
like
a
man
and
you
you
laugh
at
me
you
escaped
punishment
for
your
theft
from
that
poor
widow
you
have
escaped
from
god
knows
how
many
such
crimes
but
now
in
the
name
of
the
people
you
have
tricked
and
robbed
under
the
cover
of
business
in
the
name
of
the
people
you
have
slandered
and
ruined
under
cover
of
the
church
i
going
to
give
you
what
such
a
contemptible
rascal
as
you
are
deserves
the
judge
was
a
large
man
in
the
prime
of
life
but
his
natural
weapons
of
warfare
were
those
of
the
fox
the
coyote
and
their
kin
cornered
he
made
a
show
of
resistance
but
he
was
as
a
child
in
the
hands
of
the
young
giant
who
thrashed
him
until
he
lay
moaning
and
groaning
in
pain
on
the
ground
when
dan
at
last
drew
back
the
doctor
who
through
it
all
had
remained
quietly
seated
on
the
fence
an
interested
spectator
climbed
down
from
his
position
and
came
slowly
forward
looking
the
judge
over
with
a
professional
eye
he
turned
to
dan
with
a
chuckle
you
made
a
mighty
good
job
of
it
lad
a
mighty
good
job
lord
how
i
envied
you
chuck
him
into
his
buggy
now
and
i
take
him
home
you
can
follow
in
our
rig
so
they
went
home
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
and
the
old
doctor
told
around
town
a
tale
of
how
the
judge
had
met
with
an
accident
at
ford
that
would
keep
him
in
the
house
for
quite
a
spell
dan
spent
his
last
evening
in
corinth
with
harry
and
the
next
morning
he
left

last

of

still
the

are
dead
days
shadowed
by
the
monument
which
yet
holds
its
place
in
the
heart
of
the

gathered
to
himself
additional
glory
and

by
his
continued
activity
and

with
his

the

seldom
goes
fishing

though
he
still
cultivates
his
roses
and
as
he
says
meddles
in
the
affairs

some

and
now
this
story
goes
back
again
to
the
mountains
to
end
where
it
began
back
to
where
the
ridges
roll
like
mighty
green
billows
into
the
far
distant
sky
where
the
vast
forests
lie
all
in
the
breeze
shimmering
in
the
sun
and
the
soft
blue
haze
of
the
late
summer
lies
lazily
over
the

up

down

and

on

with

their

but
in
the

are

lifts
its

at
times
rolls
over

unaltered
from
the

on

you
may
see
the

show
black
against
the

and
from

past

past

and
around
the
shoulder
of

looking
away
into
the
great
world
beyond
still
lies
the
trail
that
is
nobody
knows
how
old
so
in
life
with
all
the
changes
that
time
inevitably
brings
with
all
our
civilization
our
inventions
and
improvements
some
things
must
remain
unchanged
some

the
great
landmarks
in
life
and
in
religion
the
hills
the

the
mists
must
ever
remain
the
same
some
things
thank
god
are
beyond
the
damning
power
of
our
improvements
in
minor
things
the
matthews
home
itself
is
altered
but
dan
father
and
mother
are
still
in
spite
of
the
years
that
have
come
young
matt
and
sammy
it
was
that
best
of
all
seasons
in
the
ozarks
october
the
month
of
gold
when
they
were
sitting
on
the
front
porch
in
the
evening
with
the
old
doctor
who
had
arrived
during
the
afternoon
now
doctor
said
the
mother
tell
us
all
about
it
there
was
no
uneasiness
in
her
calm
voice
no
shadow
of
worry
in
her
quiet
eyes
and
the
boy
father
by
her
side
was
like
her
in
serene
confidence
they
knew
from
dan
letters
something
of
the
trials
through
which
he
had
passed
they
had
assured
him
often
of
their
sympathy
it
never
occurred
to
them
to
doubt
him
in
any
way
or
to
question
the
final
outcome
yes
doctor
came
the
deep
voice
of
the
father
we
have
had
letters
of
course
but
the
lad
not
one
to
put
all
of
his
fight
on
paper
let
have
it
as
you
saw
it
so
the
doctor
told
them
told
of
the
causes
that
had
combined
to
put
dan
on
the
rack
that
had
driven
him
in
spite
of
himself
to
change
his
views
of
the
church
and
its
ministry
told
of
the
forces
that
had
been
arrayed
against
him
how
the
lad
had
met
these
forces
and
how
he
had
battled
with
himself
all
that
the
doctor
had
seen
in
the
months
of
watching
all
that
he
knew
of
dan
even
to
the
time
when
dan
declared
his
doubt
of
everything
and
to
the
chastising
of
judge
strong
he
omitted
nothing
except
the
declaration
he
had
heard
dan
make
to
the
judge
several
times
the
narrator
was
interrupted
by
the
hearty
laugh
of
the
father
or
with
exclamations
of
satisfaction
sometimes
the
doctor
was
interrupted
by
a
quick
eager
question
from
the
mother
that
helped
to
make
the
story
clear
many
times
they
uttered
exclamations
of
wonder
distress
or
indignation
when
he
left
corinth
said
the
doctor
in
conclusion
he
told
me
that
he
had
no
plans
though
he
hinted
at
something
that
he
had
in
mind
but
doctor
have
you
forgotten
a
very
important
part
of
your
story
the
mother
asked
what
have
i
forgotten
he
questioned
why
the
girl
of
course
what
is
a
story
without
a
girl
she
laughed
merrily
to
which
the
doctor
answered
i
reckon
dan
will
tell
you
about
that
himself
at
this
they
all
joined
in
a
hearty
laugh
the
next
day
dan
arrived
and
after
a
brief
time
given
up
to
the
joy
of
family
reunion
he
took
up
the
story
where
the
doctor
had
left
off
from
corinth
dan
had
gone
directly
to
the
president
of
the
big
steel
works
whom
he
had
met
at
the
time
of
the
convention
with
the
assistance
and
advice
of
this
man
of
affairs
he
had
been
visiting
the
big
mines
and
smelters
and
studying
zinc
and
lead
he
had
worked
out
his
plan
and
had
interested
capital
and
had
come
home
to
consult
with
his
parents
concerning
the
opening
and
development
of
the
mine
on
dewey
bald
then
he
talked
to
them
of
the
power
of
wealth
for
good
of
the
sacredness
of
such
a
trust
talked
as
they
had
never
heard
him
talk
before
of
the
grace
conners
and
the
crippled
dennys
who
needed
elder
brothers
willing
to
acknowledge
the
kinship
when
he
had
finished
his
mother
kissed
him
and
his
father
said
it
is
for
this
son
that
mother
and
i
have
held
the
old
hill
yonder
it
is
a
part
of
our
religious
belief
that
god
put
the
wealth
in
the
mountains
not
for
us
alone
but
for
all
men
so
it
has
been
to
us
a
sacred
trust
which
we
have
never
felt
that
we
were
fitted
to
administer
we
have
always
hoped
that
our
first
born
would
accept
it
as
his
life
work
his
ministry
so
dan
found
his
garden
and
entered
the
ministry
that
has
made
his
life
such
a
blessing
to
men
the
next
morning
he
saddled
his
mother
horse
early
at
breakfast
she
announced
that
she
was
going
over
to
the
jones
ranch
on
the
other
side
of
dewey
and
what
are
you
planning
to
do
today
she
said
to
dan
as
he
followed
her
out
of
the
house
i
was
going
over
to
old
dewey
myself
he
answered
i
thought
i
would
like
to
look
the
ground
over
he
smiled
down
at
her
but
now
i
going
with
you
just
wait
a
minute
until
i
saddle
a
horse
she
laughed
at
him
oh
no
you
not
but
mother
i
want
to
talk
to
you
i
i
have
something
to
tell
you
yes
i
know
she
nodded
you
have
already
told
me
has
doctor
he
burst
forth
no
indeed
for
shame
dan
you
know
doctor
would
it
was
in
your
letters
and
but
i
have
planned
for
you
to
tell
me
the
rest
this
evening
go
with
your
father
and
doctor
to
look
at
the
stock
this
morning
and
write
your
business
letters
while
i
attend
to
affairs
then
the
first
thing
after
dinner
you
slip
away
alone
over
to
dewey
and
do
your
planning
perhaps
i
meet
you
on
the
old
trail
as
you
come
back
you
see
i
have
it
all
fixed
yes
he
said
slowly
you
always
have
things
fixed
do
you
what
a
mother
you
are
there
only
one
other
woman
in
all
the
world
like
you
and
at
this
she
answered
bravely
yes
i
know
dear
i
have
always
known
it
would
come
and
i
am
glad
glad
my
boy
but
i
i
think
you
better
kiss
me
now
so
she
left
him
standing
at
the
fence
and
rode
away
alone
down
the
old
familiar
path
after
dinner
dan
set
out
chapter
xliv
the
old
trail
those
whose
hearts
and
souls
are
big
enough
to
follow
the
trail
that
is
nobody
knows
how
old
leaving
the
ridge
just
beyond
the
low
gap
dan
made
his
way
down
the
mountain
side
into
the
deep
ravine
below
sammy
lookout
that
opens
into
the
hollow
for
an
hour
he
roamed
about
his
mind
upon
his
plans
for
the
development
of
the
wealth
that
lay
in
the
heart
of
the
mountain
after
a
time
still
intent
upon
his
work
he
scrambled
up
the
end
of
the
little
canyon
regained
the
ridge
near
the
mouth
of
the
cave
then
climbed
up
on
the
steep
slope
of
dewey
to
the
top
from
here
he
could
follow
with
his
eye
a
possible
route
for
the
spur
that
should
leave
the
railroad
on
garber
to
the
east
round
the
base
of
the
mountain
and
reach
the
mine
through
the
little
ravine
on
the
west
from
the
top
he
made
his
way
slowly
toward
the
lookout
thinking
from
there
to
gain
still
another
view
of
the
scene
of
his
proposed
operations
and
to
watch
the
trail
for
the
coming
of
his
mother
drawing
near
the
great
ledge
of
rock
that
hangs
so
like
a
cornice
on
the
mountain
side
he
caught
a
glimpse
through
the
screen
of
trees
and
bushes
of
a
figure
seated
on
the
old
familiar
spot
his
mother
must
have
come
sooner
than
she
intended
he
thought
or
else
he
had
been
longer
than
he
realized
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
early
yet
then
going
on
a
little
he
suddenly
stopped
that
was
not
his
mother
he
drew
nearer
and
pushed
aside
a
bush
for
a
better
view
his
heart
leaped
at
sight
of
the
familiar
blue
dress
and
its
white
trimming
the
figure
turned
slightly
as
if
to
look
up
the
trail
the
big
fellow
on
the
mountain
side
trembled
how
like
he
whispered
half
aloud
god
how
like
softly
as
one
fearing
to
dispel
a
welcome
illusion
he
drew
nearer
nearer
nearer
suddenly
a
dry
bush
on
the
ground
snapped
under
his
foot
she
turned
her
face
quickly
toward
him
then
springing
to
her
feet
hope
farwell
stood
waiting
with
joy
lighted
face
as
dan
went
stumbling
in
wondering
haste
down
the
hill
i
thought
you
were
never
coming
she
said
i
have
been
waiting
so
long
and
then
for
a
little
while
there
was
nothing
more
said
that
we
have
any
right
whatever
to
hear
when
he
insisted
upon
an
explanation
of
the
miracle
she
laughed
merrily
why
it
like
most
miracles
i
fancy
if
only
one
knew
about
them
the
most
natural
thing
that
could
happen
after
all
dr
miles
came
to
me
some
two
months
ago
and
said
that
he
had
a
patient
whom
he
was
sending
into
the
mountains
with
a
nurse
and
asked
me
if
i
would
take
the
case
he
said
he
thought
that
i
would
like
to
see
the
mutton
hollow
country
and
and
that
he
thought
that
i
needed
the
trip
you
can
imagine
how
quickly
i
said
that
i
would
go
i
am
living
down
at
the
jones
place
where
my
mother
went
this
morning
dan
broke
in
eagerly
she
nodded
your
mother
and
i
are
are
very
good
friends
she
said
demurely
does
she
hope
blushed
i
could
help
telling
her
you
see
she
had
your
letters
and
she
already
knew
a
great
deal
she
i
suppose
she
told
you
all
about
it
my
finish
at
corinth
i
mean
and
my
plans
interrupted
dan
yes
hope
replied
then
there
nothing
more
to
do
but
how
is
your
patient
he
finished
abruptly
how
long
must
you
stay
with
the
case
she
turned
her
head
away
my
patient
went
home
three
days
ago
when
the
sun
was
touching
the
fringe
of
trees
on
the
distant
ridge
and
the
varying
tints
of
brown
and
gold
under
the
softening
tone
of
the
haze
that
lies
always
over
hollow
and
hill
were
most
clearly
revealed
in
the
evening
light
dan
and
hope
followed
the
same
path
that
young
matt
and
sammy
walked
years
before
in
the
edge
of
the
timber
beyond
the
deerlick
the
two
young
lovers
found
those
other
older
lovers
and
were
welcomed
by
them
with
the
welcome
that
can
only
be
given
or
received
by
those
whose
hearts
and
souls
are
big
enough
to
follow
the
trail
that
is
nobody
knows
how
old
