the
tale
of
chirpy
cricket
i
the
fiddler
if
chirpy
cricket
had
begun
to
make
music
earlier
in
the
summer
perhaps
he
would
have
given
so
much
time
to
fiddling
in
farmer
farmyard
everybody
admitted
that
chirpy
was
the
most
musical
insect
in
the
whole
neighborhood
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
tried
his
hardest
to
crowd
as
much
music
as
possible
into
a
few
weeks
though
he
had
been
silent
enough
during
all
the
spring
he
had
dug
himself
a
hole
in
the
ground
under
some
straw
that
was
scattered
near
the
barn
and
every
night
from
midsummer
on
he
came
out
and
made
merry
but
in
the
daytime
he
was
usually
quiet
as
a
mouse
sitting
inside
his
hole
and
doing
nothing
at
all
except
to
wait
patiently
until
it
should
be
dark
again
so
that
he
might
crawl
forth
from
his
hiding
place
and
take
up
his
music
where
he
had
left
it
unfinished
the
night
before
somehow
he
always
knew
exactly
where
to
begin
although
he
carried
no
sheets
of
music
with
him
he
never
had
to
stop
and
wonder
what
note
to
begin
on
for
the
reason
that
he
always
fiddled
on
the
same
one
when
rude
people
asked
chirpy
cricket
as
they
did
now
and
then
why
he
did
change
his
tune
he
always
replied
that
a
person
could
change
anything
without
taking
time
and
since
he
expected
to
make
only
a
short
stay
in
pleasant
valley
he
did
want
to
fritter
away
any
precious
moments
chirpy
cricket
neighbors
soon
noticed
that
he
carried
his
fiddle
with
him
everywhere
he
went
and
the
curious
ones
asked
him
a
question
why
they
inquired
why
are
you
forever
taking
your
fiddle
with
you
and
chirpy
cricket
reminded
them
that
the
summer
would
be
gone
almost
before
anybody
knew
it
he
said
that
when
he
wanted
to
play
a
tune
he
did
intend
to
waste
any
valuable
time
hunting
for
his
fiddle
now
all
that
was
true
enough
but
it
was
just
as
true
that
he
have
left
his
fiddle
at
home
anyhow
chirpy
made
his
music
with
his
two
wings
he
rubbed
a
ridge
of
one
on
a
rough
part
of
the
other
so
his
fiddle
if
you
could
call
it
by
that
name
just
naturally
had
to
go
wherever
he
did
when
that
shrill
sound
all
on
one
note
rang
out
in
the
night
everybody
that
heard
it
knew
that
chirpy
cricket
was
sawing
out
his
odd
music
and
the
warmer
the
night
the
faster
he
played
he
liked
warm
weather
somehow
it
seemed
to
make
him
feel
especially
lively
people
who
wanted
to
be
disagreeable
were
always
remarking
in
chirpy
cricket
hearing
that
they
hoped
there
would
be
an
early
frost
they
thought
of
course
he
would
know
they
were
tired
of
his
music
and
wished
he
would
keep
still
but
such
speeches
only
made
him
fiddle
the
faster
an
early
frost
he
would
exclaim
i
must
hurry
if
i
to
finish
my
summer
fiddling
now
chirpy
had
dozens
and
dozens
of
relations
living
in
holes
of
their
own
in
the
farmyard
or
the
fields
and
the
gentlemen
were
all
musical
like
him
they
were
fiddlers
somehow
fiddling
ran
in
their
family
so
on
warm
nights
during
the
last
half
of
the
summer
there
was
sure
to
be
a
crickets
concert
sometimes
it
seemed
to
johnnie
green
who
lived
in
the
farmhouse
as
if
chirpy
cricket
and
his
relations
were
trying
to
drown
the
songs
of
the
musical
frog
family
over
in
the
swamp
ii
quick
and
easy
of
course
chirpy
cricket
did
spend
all
his
time
merely
sitting
quietly
in
his
hole
in
the
daytime
and
fiddling
every
night
of
course
he
had
to
eat
and
each
night
he
was
in
the
habit
of
creeping
out
of
his
hole
and
gathering
spears
of
grass
in
farmer
green
yard
which
he
carried
home
with
him
he
called
that
doing
his
marketing
and
it
was
lucky
for
him
that
he
liked
grass
there
was
so
much
of
it
to
be
had
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
step
outside
his
door
and
there
it
was
all
around
him
it
made
housekeeping
an
easy
matter
and
left
him
plenty
of
time
every
night
to
fiddle
and
frolic
somehow
chirpy
could
never
go
from
one
place
to
another
in
a
slow
sober
walk
he
always
moved
by
leaps
as
if
he
felt
too
gay
to
plod
along
like
daddy
longlegs
for
instance
chirpy
himself
often
remarked
that
he
had
time
to
move
slowly
and
almost
before
he
had
finished
speaking
as
likely
as
not
he
would
jump
into
the
air
and
alight
some
distance
away
it
was
all
done
so
quickly
that
a
person
could
scarcely
see
how
it
happened
but
chirpy
cricket
said
it
was
as
easy
as
anything
and
having
leaped
like
that
often
he
would
begin
to
shuffle
his
wings
together
the
moment
he
landed
on
the
ground
thereby
making
his
shrill
music
many
of
his
neighbors
declared
that
he
believed
a
short
life
and
a
merry
one
was
the
best
kind
and
when
they
thought
of
timothy
turtle
who
was
so
old
that
nobody
could
even
guess
his
age
and
was
so
disagreeable
and
snappish
that
every
one
kept
out
of
his
way
the
neighbors
decided
that
possibly
chirpy
cricket
way
was
the
better
of
the
two
anyhow
there
was
no
doubt
that
timothy
turtle
believed
in
a
long
life
and
a
grumpy
one
all
chirpy
relations
were
of
the
same
mind
as
he
they
acted
as
if
they
would
rather
make
the
nights
ring
with
their
music
than
do
anything
else
and
johnnie
green
said
one
evening
when
he
heard
solomon
owl
hooting
over
in
the
hemlock
woods
that
it
was
lucky
there
were
as
many
owls
as
there
were
crickets
in
the
valley
if
there
were
hundreds
or
maybe
thousands
of
owls
and
they
all
hooted
at
the
same
time
there
be
no
sleeping
for
anybody
at
least
that
was
johnnie
green
opinion
and
it
does
seem
a
reasonable
one
chirpy
cricket
nearest
relations
all
looked
exactly
like
him
everybody
said
that
the
crickets
bore
a
strong
family
resemblance
to
one
another
but
there
were
others
more
distant
cousins
that
were
quite
unlike
chirpy
there
were
the
mole
crickets
who
stayed
in
the
ground
and
never
never
came
to
the
surface
and
there
were
the
tree
crickets
who
lived
in
the
trees
and
fiddled
until
you
might
have
thought
they
would
get
tired
of
their
ditty
but
they
never
did
they
seemed
to
like
their
music
as
much
as
chirpy
cricket
liked
his
iii
the
bumblebee
family
the
farmyard
was
not
the
first
place
that
chirpy
cricket
chose
for
his
home
before
he
dug
himself
a
hole
under
the
straw
near
the
barn
he
had
settled
in
the
pasture
although
the
cows
seemed
to
think
that
the
grass
in
the
pasture
belonged
to
them
alone
chirpy
decided
that
there
ought
to
be
enough
for
him
too
if
he
did
eat
too
much
he
had
been
living
in
the
pasture
some
time
before
he
discovered
that
a
very
musical
family
had
come
to
live
next
door
to
him
they
were
known
as
the
bumblebees
and
there
were
dozens
of
them
huddled
into
a
hole
long
since
deserted
by
some
woodchucks
that
had
moved
to
other
quarters
although
they
were
said
to
be
great
workers
most
of
them
the
bumblebee
family
found
plenty
of
time
to
make
music
they
were
very
fond
of
humming
and
in
the
beginning
chirpy
cricket
thought
their
humming
a
pleasant
sound
to
hear
as
he
sat
in
his
dark
hole
during
the
daytime
they
having
a
party
in
there
he
said
the
first
time
he
noticed
the
droning
music
no
doubt
he
added
no
doubt
they
enjoying
a
dance
the
thought
made
him
feel
so
jolly
that
if
it
had
only
been
dark
out
of
doors
he
would
have
left
his
home
and
leaped
about
in
the
pasture
all
that
day
between
naps
chirpy
could
hear
the
humming
certainly
a
long
party
he
exclaimed
when
he
awoke
late
in
the
afternoon
and
heard
the
bumblebee
family
still
making
music
but
about
sunset
their
humming
stopped
and
chirpy
cricket
could
help
feeling
a
bit
disappointed
because
he
had
hoped
to
enjoy
a
dance
himself
to
the
bumblebees
music
when
he
left
his
home
that
evening
a
little
later
he
told
his
favorite
cousin
about
the
party
that
had
lasted
all
day
and
chirpy
said
that
he
supposed
the
bumblebees
had
only
one
party
a
year
because
he
understood
that
most
of
them
were
great
workers
and
he
did
believe
they
would
care
to
spend
a
whole
day
humming
very
often
the
favorite
cousin
gave
chirpy
a
strange
look
in
the
moonlight
and
then
he
began
to
fiddle
making
no
remark
whatsoever
he
thought
there
was
no
use
wasting
words
on
a
fine
warm
night
just
the
sort
of
night
for
a
lively
chirpy
cricket
lost
no
time
in
getting
his
own
fiddle
to
working
and
each
of
them
really
believed
he
was
himself
making
most
of
the
music
that
was
heard
in
the
pasture
once
in
a
while
chirpy
cricket
and
his
cousin
stopped
to
eat
a
little
grass
or
paused
to
carry
a
few
spears
into
their
holes
because
they
liked
to
have
something
to
nibble
on
in
the
daytime
but
they
always
returned
to
their
fiddling
again
and
they
never
stopped
for
good
until
almost
morning
but
at
last
chirpy
cricket
announced
that
he
would
make
no
more
music
that
night
i
go
home
now
he
said
i
expect
to
have
a
good
day
rest
and
i
meet
you
at
this
same
spot
night
for
a
little
fiddling
i
be
here
his
favorite
cousin
promised
iv
too
much
music
it
was
just
beginning
to
grow
light
in
the
east
when
chirpy
cricket
crawled
into
his
hole
in
the
pasture
after
his
fiddling
with
his
favorite
cousin
having
spent
a
good
deal
of
the
previous
day
in
listening
to
the
humming
of
the
musical
bumblebee
family
who
lived
next
door
to
him
chirpy
was
more
than
ready
to
rest
all
was
quiet
at
that
hour
of
the
morning
except
for
the
creaky
fiddling
of
a
relation
of
chirpy
who
did
appear
to
know
that
it
was
time
to
go
home
but
chirpy
cricket
did
mind
that
fiddling
never
bothered
him
he
never
knew
whether
he
had
fallen
asleep
or
not
he
may
have
been
only
anyhow
all
at
once
he
noticed
a
rumbling
sound
which
grew
louder
and
louder
as
he
listened
they
at
it
again
chirpy
cricket
exclaimed
the
bumblebee
family
have
begun
their
music
i
do
hope
they
are
going
to
have
another
party
for
i
do
want
my
rest
disturbed
but
he
soon
found
that
the
bumblebees
were
not
tuning
up
for
nothing
before
long
they
were
humming
and
buzzing
away
as
if
they
had
a
care
in
the
world
i
declare
chirpy
cried
although
there
was
no
one
but
himself
to
hear
i
declare
they
dancing
again
it
ca
be
long
after
sunrise
either
and
no
doubt
they
wo
stop
till
sunset
he
began
to
feel
very
much
upset
he
could
understand
why
people
should
want
to
make
music
by
night
and
hop
about
in
a
lively
fashion
too
but
by
day
ah
that
was
another
matter
being
unable
to
rest
on
account
of
the
uproar
from
the
house
chirpy
crept
out
of
his
door
and
stood
blinking
in
the
pasture
soon
he
noticed
a
plump
person
sitting
on
a
head
of
clover
which
the
cows
had
overlooked
chirpy
could
see
clearly
who
he
was
coming
up
out
of
the
darkness
as
he
had
but
he
was
glad
there
was
somebody
to
talk
to
anyhow
good
morning
he
greeted
the
person
on
the
adding
in
a
lower
tone
they
a
queer
family
those
bumblebees
to
his
great
dismay
the
person
to
whom
he
had
spoken
began
to
buzz
and
leaping
nearer
him
in
order
to
see
him
better
chirpy
cricket
discovered
that
he
had
been
talking
to
buster
bumblebee
buster
was
a
blundering
chap
and
to
chirpy
relief
instead
of
getting
angry
he
merely
laughed
i
did
mean
to
hurt
your
feelings
chirpy
told
him
if
disagreeable
this
morning
it
because
i
need
a
good
rest
and
your
family
humming
disturbs
me
why
do
you
think
we
queer
buster
asked
him
do
you
call
it
a
bit
odd
having
a
dance
at
this
time
of
day
bless
you
they
not
dancing
in
there
buster
bumblebee
cried
that
the
workers
storing
away
the
honey
they
always
buzzing
like
that
perhaps
you
did
know
that
our
ca
work
without
being
noisy
to
tell
the
truth
they
wake
me
every
morning
and
often
rather
sleep
will
they
keep
this
racket
up
all
summer
chirpy
inquired
on
all
pleasant
days
buster
bumblebee
said
then
said
chirpy
cricket
i
have
to
move
to
a
quieter
neighborhood
this
humming
every
day
would
soon
drive
me
frantic
i
do
blame
you
buster
bumblebee
told
him
i
often
felt
that
way
myself
v
a
light
in
the
dark
chirpy
cricket
preferred
the
dark
to
the
day
he
was
quite
different
from
jennie
junebug
and
mehitable
moth
who
dearly
loved
a
light
at
night
and
would
dash
joyously
into
any
they
saw
there
was
only
one
light
that
chirpy
cricket
was
always
glad
to
see
he
thought
freddie
firefly
flashes
looked
very
cheerful
as
they
twinkled
about
the
farmyard
and
he
often
told
freddie
that
he
would
be
willing
to
linger
above
ground
in
the
daytime
now
and
then
if
only
freddie
would
stay
with
him
and
make
merry
with
his
light
but
freddie
firefly
knew
enough
to
decline
the
invitation
he
was
well
aware
that
nobody
could
see
his
light
when
the
sun
was
shining
and
he
was
afraid
that
other
merrymakers
in
the
farmyard
might
make
matters
far
from
merry
for
him
for
freddie
firefly
feared
all
birds
at
night
he
used
his
trusty
light
to
frighten
nighthawk
or
willie
but
he
did
intend
to
run
any
risk
in
the
daytime
with
jolly
robin
or
rusty
wren
chirpy
cricket
soon
saw
that
it
was
useless
to
try
to
get
freddie
firefly
to
enjoy
an
outing
with
him
by
daylight
so
every
night
he
spent
as
much
time
as
he
could
in
freddie
company
if
the
truth
were
known
chirpy
cricket
wished
that
he
had
a
light
of
his
own
and
he
could
help
hoping
that
sooner
or
later
freddie
firefly
would
offer
to
lend
him
his
night
after
night
the
two
met
in
the
farmyard
but
nothing
seemed
further
from
freddie
firefly
thoughts
than
lending
his
brilliant
light
to
chirpy
cricket
or
to
any
one
else
but
chirpy
simply
could
keep
his
eyes
off
that
wonderful
when
freddie
firefly
was
in
the
neighborhood
people
began
to
notice
that
he
even
stopped
fiddling
sometimes
to
stare
at
freddie
firefly
at
last
chirpy
cricket
made
up
his
mind
that
if
he
was
ever
going
to
borrow
the
light
he
would
have
to
ask
freddie
for
it
several
nights
passed
before
he
could
think
of
a
good
reason
for
using
it
but
after
a
while
he
thought
of
a
fine
one
so
he
went
straight
to
freddie
firefly
i
going
to
see
miss
christabel
cricket
home
after
the
music
is
over
tonight
chirpy
said
and
i
been
wondering
if
you
be
willing
to
do
me
a
favor
why
certainly
freddie
firefly
told
him
will
you
loan
me
your
light
chirpy
asked
him
you
know
there
be
no
moon
when
it
time
to
go
home
and
your
light
would
be
a
great
help
to
me
for
miss
christabel
lives
beyond
the
barnyard
fence
for
just
a
few
moments
freddy
firefly
appeared
greatly
surprised
to
tell
the
truth
chirpy
request
almost
took
his
breath
away
and
while
he
recovered
himself
he
forgot
to
flash
his
light
a
most
unusual
oversight
but
freddie
was
no
person
to
disappoint
a
friend
besides
he
had
just
said
why
certainly
really
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
but
to
say
the
same
thing
again
vi
a
plan
goes
wrong
chirpy
cricket
never
fiddled
faster
than
he
did
that
night
somehow
he
had
a
notion
that
the
faster
he
fiddled
the
more
quickly
the
night
would
pass
for
freddie
firefly
had
promised
to
loan
chirpy
his
light
because
chirpy
needed
it
when
he
saw
miss
christabel
cricket
to
her
home
beyond
the
barnyard
fence
chirpy
was
going
to
see
her
safely
to
her
door
when
the
night
concert
was
ended
and
he
could
hardly
wait
until
the
time
came
when
he
would
flash
that
wonderful
light
in
the
eyes
of
all
his
friends
i
hope
you
wo
go
dancing
across
the
meadow
tonight
he
remarked
anxiously
to
freddie
firefly
you
might
wander
into
the
swamp
and
get
lost
oh
there
no
danger
of
that
freddie
assured
him
if
you
stumbled
into
the
wet
swamp
you
might
put
your
light
out
chirpy
cricket
warned
him
but
freddie
firefly
laughed
and
told
him
not
to
worry
i
always
enjoy
at
least
one
dance
in
the
meadow
each
night
he
explained
they
expecting
me
over
there
now
and
i
do
want
to
disappoint
them
no
chirpy
answered
and
neither
do
you
want
to
disappoint
me
so
please
do
fail
to
be
on
hand
when
the
music
finished
after
telling
chirpy
that
he
would
fail
him
freddie
firefly
flitted
away
but
in
spite
of
what
he
had
said
chirpy
cricket
could
help
feeling
nervous
and
uneasy
and
he
fiddled
so
fast
that
the
other
fiddlers
kept
complaining
they
said
he
was
playing
in
time
chirpy
cricket
was
too
to
contradict
them
but
he
had
his
own
opinion
which
he
kept
to
himself
he
thought
his
companions
were
out
of
time
goodness
he
exclaimed
under
his
breath
i
near
heard
such
slow
fiddling
in
all
my
life
there
was
another
way
too
in
which
chirpy
annoyed
the
others
he
kept
asking
them
first
one
and
then
another
what
time
it
was
and
of
course
nobody
wants
to
stop
and
look
at
his
watch
when
he
is
fiddling
at
last
one
of
his
cousins
told
him
in
answer
to
his
question
that
it
was
time
to
stop
talking
and
pay
attention
to
the
music
after
that
chirpy
cricket
tried
to
be
patient
but
it
was
hard
not
to
be
restless
and
he
kept
leaping
into
the
air
hoping
to
get
a
glimpse
of
freddie
firefly
twinkling
light
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
freddie
would
never
return
from
the
meadow
at
last
the
fiddlers
stopped
playing
one
after
another
for
the
night
was
going
fast
the
cricket
family
always
liked
to
be
home
before
daylight
chirpy
had
almost
given
up
hope
of
seeing
freddie
firefly
but
to
his
great
delight
freddie
came
skipping
up
just
as
chirpy
stood
before
miss
christabel
cricket
whom
he
expected
to
see
to
her
home
i
glad
you
come
chirpy
greeted
him
i
take
your
light
now
and
i
return
it
to
you
night
oh
that
would
be
too
much
trouble
for
you
freddie
firefly
said
go
right
along
with
you
and
your
young
lady
and
after
i
lighted
her
home
i
do
the
same
thing
for
you
oh
that
would
be
too
much
trouble
for
you
chirpy
cricket
objected
let
me
take
the
light
please
he
certainly
did
want
freddie
firefly
tagging
along
with
miss
christabel
cricket
and
himself
of
course
freddie
firefly
give
chirpy
his
light
it
was
just
as
much
a
part
of
him
as
his
head
and
since
chirpy
cricket
began
to
get
excited
and
said
again
and
again
that
the
light
had
been
promised
him
in
the
end
freddie
had
to
explain
everything
it
was
a
great
disappointment
to
chirpy
cricket
he
had
expected
to
have
wonderful
fun
flashing
freddie
firefly
light
but
miss
christabel
cricket
did
not
seem
to
mind
in
the
least
you
ought
to
blame
freddie
firefly
for
not
loaning
his
light
she
said
you
know
you
would
let
him
take
your
fiddle
well
chirpy
cricket
had
thought
of
that
and
he
had
to
admit
that
what
she
said
was
true
and
just
then
the
sun
peeped
over
blue
mountain
so
everybody
hurried
home
alone
after
all
vii
johnnie
green
guest
there
were
enough
night
noises
before
chirpy
cricket
came
to
live
in
the
farmyard
what
with
solomon
owl
hooting
his
cousin
simon
quavering
call
and
the
musical
frog
family
concerts
in
cedar
swamp
it
was
a
wonder
that
johnnie
green
ever
managed
to
fall
asleep
the
katydids
alone
were
almost
enough
to
drive
anybody
frantic
if
he
let
himself
listen
to
them
with
their
everlasting
cry
of
did
katy
did
she
did
she
johnnie
green
himself
said
he
wished
the
crickets
had
gone
somewhere
else
to
spend
the
summer
at
least
he
thought
they
might
play
some
other
tune
besides
over
and
over
again
if
they
would
only
fiddle
yankee
doodle
now
and
then
he
said
he
would
mind
lying
awake
a
while
to
listen
to
it
perhaps
chirpy
cricket
heard
what
johnnie
green
said
maybe
he
wanted
to
punish
him
anyhow
he
crept
into
the
farmhouse
one
evening
and
found
his
way
into
johnnie
green
chamber
where
he
hid
in
a
gaping
crack
behind
the
baseboard
and
that
very
night
as
soon
as
johnnie
green
put
out
his
light
and
jumped
into
bed
chirpy
cricket
began
to
fiddle
for
him
johnnie
had
been
sleepy
but
the
moment
chirpy
cricket
began
fiddling
right
there
in
his
room
he
became
wide
awake
he
had
had
no
idea
how
loudly
one
of
the
cricket
family
could
play
his
indoors
the
high
shrill
sound
was
piercing
it
rang
in
johnnie
ears
and
drowned
the
muffled
concert
of
the
fields
and
swamp
which
the
light
breeze
bore
through
the
window
for
a
few
minutes
johnnie
lay
still
and
then
he
sat
up
in
bed
have
to
get
up
and
find
that
fellow
he
said
if
i
do
he
keep
me
awake
the
moment
he
stirred
the
fiddling
stopped
short
johnnie
was
glad
of
that
and
once
more
he
laid
his
head
upon
his
pillow
but
in
a
few
moments
that
rang
out
again
then
johnnie
green
tried
several
remedies
he
shook
the
bed
he
knocked
over
a
chair
he
caught
up
a
shoe
and
threw
it
toward
a
corner
of
the
room
whence
the
sound
seemed
to
come
and
then
he
threw
the
other
shoe
every
time
johnnie
green
made
a
noise
chirpy
cricket
stopped
fiddling
and
if
johnnie
had
had
enough
shoes
no
doubt
he
could
have
kept
chirpy
from
making
any
more
music
that
night
but
of
course
johnnie
have
slept
any
if
he
had
done
that
besides
he
would
have
kept
the
whole
family
awake
too
he
thought
of
that
after
he
had
hurled
the
second
shoe
for
his
father
called
up
the
stairs
and
asked
him
what
was
the
matter
there
an
old
cricket
in
my
room
johnnie
explained
he
keeping
me
awake
i
should
think
you
were
keeping
him
awake
said
farmer
green
get
up
and
look
for
him
if
you
must
but
do
let
him
bite
you
you
would
joke
if
this
old
cricket
was
in
your
room
johnnie
grumbled
he
did
not
grumble
often
but
he
had
had
a
long
hard
day
swimming
in
the
and
climbing
apple
trees
and
he
wanted
to
go
to
sleep
johnnie
green
thought
it
was
no
time
to
crack
jokes
viii
pleasing
johnnie
green
johnnie
green
knew
that
he
could
never
find
the
cricket
in
the
dark
so
he
crawled
out
of
bed
and
lighted
a
candle
blinking
a
few
moments
in
its
flickering
flame
from
his
hiding
place
in
the
crack
of
the
baseboard
in
a
corner
of
johnnie
green
chamber
chirpy
cricket
saw
the
gleam
of
the
candle
and
he
wondered
whether
it
might
be
a
relation
of
freddie
firefly
it
seemed
to
have
a
trick
of
moving
about
in
a
jerky
fashion
as
if
it
did
know
where
it
was
going
and
did
greatly
care
so
long
as
it
was
on
the
move
chirpy
cricket
kept
still
as
a
mouse
then
he
soon
saw
that
the
bearer
of
the
bright
light
was
quite
unlike
freddie
firefly
in
one
way
he
made
a
tremendous
racket
knocking
over
almost
everything
in
the
room
in
a
few
minutes
a
voice
called
up
the
stairway
again
is
the
cricket
chasing
you
it
asked
it
was
farmer
green
speaking
to
johnnie
do
tease
me
johnnie
green
cried
come
up
and
help
me
find
him
so
farmer
green
climbed
the
stairs
and
looked
into
johnnie
room
and
laughed
maybe
i
ought
to
have
brought
the
old
shotgun
he
said
i
hate
to
have
a
cricket
jump
at
me
johnnie
managed
to
grin
at
that
he
was
so
wide
awake
that
he
no
longer
felt
like
grumbling
the
trouble
with
this
cricket
is
that
he
wo
jump
he
told
his
father
i
ca
tell
where
he
is
because
he
keeps
still
whenever
i
move
but
when
the
light
out
and
everything
quiet
he
makes
a
terrible
noise
that
a
trick
crickets
have
farmer
green
observed
and
i
must
say
that
if
i
were
a
cricket
i
act
the
same
way
of
course
chirpy
cricket
heard
everything
that
was
said
and
he
help
thinking
that
farmer
green
was
a
very
sensible
person
i
dare
say
he
be
a
famous
fiddler
if
he
belonged
to
our
family
chirpy
told
himself
and
for
a
moment
or
two
he
was
tempted
to
play
a
tune
for
farmer
green
but
he
thought
better
of
the
notion
at
once
he
remembered
that
farmer
green
had
climbed
the
stairs
to
hunt
for
him
and
chirpy
squeezed
himself
further
into
the
crack
where
he
was
hiding
until
he
was
so
huddled
up
that
he
could
have
fiddled
if
he
had
wanted
to
though
they
looked
carefully
neither
johnnie
nor
his
father
could
find
him
and
at
last
they
had
to
admit
that
it
was
useless
to
search
any
longer
what
shall
i
do
johnnie
wailed
as
soon
as
i
put
out
the
light
and
get
into
bed
he
begin
chirping
again
in
such
cases
farmer
green
answered
wisely
there
only
one
thing
to
do
what
that
johnnie
inquired
hopefully
all
you
can
do
said
farmer
green
is
to
come
downstairs
and
have
something
to
eat
now
that
may
seem
a
strange
remedy
but
somehow
it
just
suited
johnnie
green
he
pattered
barefooted
down
the
stairs
and
later
when
he
went
to
bed
again
and
chirpy
cricket
began
to
chirp
once
more
all
johnnie
green
said
was
this
sing
away
little
tommy
tucker
you
may
not
know
it
but
you
sang
for
my
supper
and
the
next
moment
johnnie
green
was
sound
asleep
ix
an
interrupted
nap
chirpy
cricket
liked
his
home
in
farmer
green
yard
during
the
long
summer
days
he
thought
it
very
cheerful
to
rest
in
his
dark
hole
in
the
ground
he
liked
the
darkness
of
his
home
he
liked
its
warmth
too
for
in
pleasant
weather
the
sun
beat
down
upon
the
ground
above
him
and
gave
him
plenty
of
heat
while
on
gray
days
the
straw
blanket
kept
his
house
cosy
and
it
never
occurred
to
chirpy
cricket
that
there
was
anything
odd
in
having
a
blanket
over
his
house
instead
of
over
himself
nothing
ever
really
disturbed
chirpy
cricket
after
he
settled
in
the
farmyard
to
be
sure
he
had
a
few
frights
at
first
now
and
then
the
earth
trembled
in
a
terrible
fashion
but
that
happened
only
when
johnnie
green
led
old
ebenezer
or
some
other
horse
to
the
passing
right
over
chirpy
home
and
chirpy
had
soon
learned
that
he
was
in
no
danger
then
at
other
times
he
heard
an
odd
tearing
and
scratching
as
if
some
giant
had
discovered
chirpy
doorway
and
meant
to
dig
him
out
of
his
hiding
place
by
peeping
slyly
out
he
discovered
at
last
the
cause
of
those
fearful
sounds
it
was
only
the
hens
looking
for
something
to
eat
a
bit
of
grain
amid
the
straw
or
perhaps
an
angleworm
chirpy
never
left
his
house
when
he
heard
the
hens
at
work
he
had
no
wish
to
offer
himself
as
a
tidbit
and
he
felt
quite
safe
down
in
his
home
for
he
was
quick
to
learn
that
the
hens
were
no
diggers
they
could
only
scratch
the
surface
of
the
ground
so
in
time
he
used
to
laugh
when
he
heard
them
and
now
and
then
he
would
even
fiddle
a
bit
as
if
to
say
to
them
here
i
am
come
and
get
me
if
you
can
the
sound
of
fiddling
coming
from
beneath
their
feet
always
puzzled
the
hens
they
would
stop
scratching
and
cock
their
heads
on
one
side
to
listen
and
they
tried
to
look
very
knowing
but
they
were
really
the
most
stupid
of
all
the
creatures
in
the
farmyard
if
they
had
only
been
as
wise
as
farmer
green
cat
they
would
have
kept
still
and
waited
and
watched
and
sooner
or
later
they
would
have
given
chirpy
cricket
the
surprise
of
his
life
when
he
came
crawling
out
of
his
hole
to
get
a
few
blades
of
grass
for
his
supper
but
even
if
the
hens
had
thought
of
such
a
plan
they
never
could
have
kept
their
minds
upon
it
long
enough
to
carry
it
out
so
perhaps
it
was
no
wonder
that
chirpy
cricket
got
the
idea
into
his
head
that
he
was
safe
from
everybody
sometimes
when
he
was
dozing
even
the
footsteps
of
old
ebenezer
failed
to
rouse
him
but
there
came
a
day
when
chirpy
cricket
awoke
with
a
great
start
something
had
touched
his
long
feelers
something
had
come
right
down
into
his
hole
and
was
prodding
him
he
thought
it
must
be
a
hen
and
he
did
not
laugh
no
nor
did
he
fiddle
x
caught
whatever
or
whoever
it
was
that
had
entered
chirpy
cricket
home
the
hole
in
the
ground
near
farmer
green
barn
it
caused
him
a
terrible
fright
it
kept
poking
him
in
a
most
alarming
fashion
chirpy
move
away
from
it
for
his
home
was
only
big
enough
for
himself
alone
and
since
he
did
care
to
share
it
with
another
he
soon
made
up
his
mind
that
there
was
only
one
thing
for
him
to
do
he
would
quit
his
house
for
the
time
being
with
the
hope
of
finding
it
empty
later
indeed
chirpy
cricket
thought
he
would
be
lucky
to
escape
in
safety
so
he
scrambled
up
into
the
daylight
to
be
greeted
with
a
shout
and
a
pounce
both
at
the
same
time
and
chirpy
cricket
saw
too
late
that
it
was
a
creature
much
bigger
than
a
hen
that
had
captured
him
it
was
johnnie
green
of
course
johnnie
himself
had
not
entered
chirpy
underground
home
what
he
had
done
was
merely
to
run
a
straw
into
the
hole
where
chirpy
lived
and
prod
him
with
it
until
he
came
out
aha
said
johnnie
green
as
he
looked
at
his
prisoner
whom
he
held
gingerly
between
a
finger
and
a
thumb
are
you
the
rascal
that
keeps
me
awake
at
night
with
your
everlasting
noise
chirpy
cricket
never
said
a
word
you
make
racket
enough
every
night
johnnie
told
him
ca
you
answer
now
when
you
spoken
to
still
chirpy
cricket
made
no
reply
he
waved
his
feelers
frantically
and
tried
to
jump
out
of
johnnie
green
grasp
but
no
matter
how
fast
he
moved
his
six
legs
he
could
get
away
you
do
seem
to
like
me
said
his
captor
finally
you
do
act
as
if
you
wanted
to
play
with
me
what
will
you
do
for
me
if
i
let
you
go
but
not
a
word
did
chirpy
cricket
say
not
one
single
word
you
a
queer
one
johnnie
green
told
him
you
might
fiddle
for
me
at
least
though
i
must
say
i
do
care
for
the
tune
you
always
play
i
can
get
better
music
out
of
a
cornstalk
fiddle
than
i
ever
heard
from
you
or
any
of
your
family
then
very
carefully
johnnie
set
chirpy
cricket
on
the
ground
with
both
his
hands
cupped
closely
over
him
so
he
could
jump
away
now
fiddle
johnnie
green
cried
fiddle
just
once
and
i
let
you
go
though
johnnie
green
waited
patiently
for
what
seemed
to
him
a
long
time
he
heard
nothing
that
sounded
the
least
bit
like
fiddling
so
at
last
he
peeped
between
two
fingers
to
see
what
the
fiddler
was
doing
but
johnnie
green
could
see
him
little
by
little
he
lifted
his
hands
and
to
his
great
surprise
there
was
nothing
under
them
but
grass
and
beneath
the
grass
a
crack
in
the
earth
well
you
a
sly
one
johnnie
green
exclaimed
you
crawled
into
that
crack
and
you
may
stay
there
too
for
all
i
care
johnnie
jumped
to
his
feet
and
moved
away
and
not
until
he
had
been
gone
some
time
did
chirpy
cricket
make
a
sound
then
he
played
a
few
notes
on
his
fiddle
just
to
see
that
it
had
been
harmed
xi
a
queer
new
cousin
chirpy
cricket
was
so
fond
of
fiddling
that
sometimes
he
was
the
last
of
all
the
big
cricket
family
to
stop
making
music
and
go
home
to
bed
now
and
then
he
lingered
so
long
above
the
ground
that
the
dawn
caught
him
before
he
crept
into
his
hole
in
the
ground
beneath
the
straw
and
one
morning
it
was
getting
so
light
before
he
had
played
enough
to
suit
him
that
he
crawled
into
a
crack
in
farmer
green
garden
it
looked
like
a
comfortable
place
to
spend
the
day
and
he
thought
it
would
be
foolish
for
him
to
do
much
travelling
at
that
hour
because
there
was
no
telling
when
an
early
bird
might
spy
and
pounce
upon
him
he
found
his
retreat
quite
to
his
liking
nothing
had
happened
to
disturb
his
rest
and
if
he
had
only
had
time
to
carry
a
few
blades
of
grass
into
the
crack
to
eat
between
naps
chirpy
would
have
had
nothing
to
wish
for
late
in
the
afternoon
however
a
most
unusual
thing
took
place
chirpy
cricket
noticed
a
sound
as
of
some
one
digging
it
grew
louder
and
louder
as
he
listened
and
it
was
not
in
the
least
like
the
scratching
of
a
hen
looking
for
grubs
and
worms
this
noise
was
deep
down
in
the
ground
and
like
nothing
chirpy
had
ever
heard
he
wished
that
he
had
not
allowed
himself
to
become
so
fond
of
fiddling
if
he
had
cared
less
for
it
he
would
have
gone
home
in
good
season
but
there
he
was
in
a
crack
in
the
garden
and
he
did
dare
leave
it
because
he
had
heard
that
the
garden
was
a
famous
place
for
birds
chirpy
cricket
was
frightened
and
when
at
last
the
loose
earth
near
him
began
to
quiver
and
even
to
crumble
he
was
so
scared
that
he
did
know
which
way
to
move
the
next
instant
a
strange
looking
person
stood
before
him
and
for
a
few
moments
neither
one
of
them
said
a
word
the
newcomer
was
a
big
fellow
very
long
and
with
enormous
legs
his
front
legs
especially
were
short
and
powerful
with
huge
feet
at
the
end
of
them
and
yet
odd
as
the
stranger
was
chirpy
could
not
help
noticing
that
somehow
he
had
a
look
like
the
cricket
family
well
said
the
stranger
at
last
you
seem
surprised
perhaps
you
were
expecting
callers
no
i
was
chirpy
cricket
answered
in
a
voice
that
was
faint
from
the
fright
he
had
had
but
you
glad
to
see
me
i
hope
the
stranger
went
on
you
know
related
to
you
you
know
i
a
sort
of
cousin
of
yours
is
that
so
chirpy
cricket
cried
i
did
think
for
a
moment
that
there
was
a
slight
family
resemblance
but
the
longer
i
look
at
you
the
queerer
you
seem
may
i
ask
your
name
i
mole
cricket
said
the
stranger
and
i
do
need
to
inquire
who
you
are
you
one
of
the
field
cricket
family
xii
an
underground
chat
chirpy
cricket
was
glad
of
one
thing
mole
cricket
quite
pleasantly
for
all
he
looked
so
frightful
when
he
dug
his
way
through
the
dirt
in
farmer
green
garden
and
broke
into
the
crack
where
chirpy
was
hiding
he
had
given
chirpy
a
terrible
start
if
you
a
cousin
of
mine
as
you
say
it
strange
that
i
never
happened
to
meet
you
before
chirpy
told
the
newcomer
not
at
all
not
at
all
mole
cricket
said
i
spend
all
my
time
underground
i
never
been
up
in
the
open
do
you
go
out
at
night
chirpy
asked
him
never
mole
cricket
declared
i
lived
my
whole
life
in
the
dirt
and
i
like
it
too
well
to
leave
it
chirpy
cricket
thought
his
cousin
was
the
queerest
person
he
had
ever
met
how
do
you
get
anything
to
eat
he
inquired
mole
cricket
seemed
to
consider
that
an
odd
question
bless
you
he
exclaimed
there
everything
to
eat
in
the
ground
everything
anybody
could
possibly
want
wherever
i
tunnel
i
find
tender
roots
you
know
farmer
green
grows
fine
vegetables
here
indeed
that
one
reason
i
live
under
his
garden
if
that
one
reason
what
another
chirpy
cricket
asked
him
for
chirpy
could
help
being
curious
about
this
cousin
of
his
who
had
such
strange
ways
and
who
was
even
stranger
to
look
upon
he
was
obliging
enough
was
mole
cricket
he
was
quite
willing
to
answer
any
and
all
questions
it
may
be
that
he
was
glad
of
the
chance
to
talk
with
somebody
certainly
it
seemed
to
chirpy
cricket
that
his
cousin
led
a
very
lonely
life
he
explained
to
chirpy
that
it
was
easy
to
dig
in
the
garden
because
its
soil
was
loose
the
ploughing
in
the
spring
and
the
harrowing
as
well
as
the
hoeing
that
farmer
green
hired
man
did
during
the
summer
kept
the
earth
in
fine
condition
for
tunnelling
of
course
living
beneath
the
surface
as
he
did
mole
cricket
had
no
way
of
knowing
why
the
garden
soil
was
so
nicely
stirred
up
he
only
knew
that
it
was
so
and
that
was
quite
enough
for
him
chirpy
cricket
said
that
it
was
all
very
interesting
to
hear
about
but
he
knew
that
he
should
care
to
follow
mole
cricket
manner
of
living
i
love
to
fiddle
he
said
i
simply
must
go
abroad
every
pleasant
night
and
make
music
but
you
do
need
to
leave
the
dirt
to
fiddle
mole
cricket
exclaimed
i
musical
too
i
often
fiddle
down
in
my
house
i
know
a
better
way
of
passing
the
time
when
a
person
not
digging
or
eating
wo
you
play
for
me
now
chirpy
cricket
asked
him
mole
cricket
was
more
than
willing
to
oblige
he
began
to
fiddle
at
once
and
the
tune
he
played
was
as
strange
as
he
was
chirpy
cricket
did
not
like
it
at
all
it
seemed
to
him
very
mournful
a
sort
of
sad
sad
air
as
if
mole
cricket
were
bewailing
his
dismal
life
beneath
the
garden
but
of
course
chirpy
was
too
polite
to
tell
that
to
his
cousin
and
when
mole
cricket
asked
him
how
he
liked
the
tune
chirpy
replied
that
it
was
very
very
interesting
xiii
a
question
of
feet
are
you
sure
you
a
cousin
of
mine
chirpy
cricket
inquired
of
mole
cricket
do
you
think
that
perhaps
you
are
mistaken
i
almost
certain
you
are
no
said
mole
cricket
i
ca
be
wrong
why
do
you
ask
me
such
a
question
your
forefeet
chirpy
told
him
your
forefeet
are
so
big
i
always
understood
that
all
our
family
had
small
ones
mole
cricket
smiled
do
let
the
size
of
my
feet
trouble
you
he
replied
i
could
be
a
mole
cricket
if
my
feet
were
like
yours
you
see
i
use
my
forefeet
for
digging
and
if
they
were
big
and
strong
i
never
could
burrow
in
this
garden
nor
anywhere
else
still
chirpy
cricket
had
his
doubts
i
inclined
to
believe
he
continued
that
you
related
to
grandfather
mole
and
not
to
me
for
your
feet
are
very
much
like
his
oh
no
mole
cricket
cried
and
for
pity
sake
do
ever
let
grandfather
mole
hear
you
say
that
he
be
so
angry
that
he
eat
me
as
likely
as
not
you
see
he
objects
to
my
name
he
says
i
have
no
right
to
call
myself
mole
cricket
but
that
the
name
my
family
has
always
had
and
i
ca
very
well
change
it
the
poor
fellow
acted
so
alarmed
that
chirpy
cricket
hastened
to
promise
him
that
he
would
never
mention
his
likeness
to
grandfather
mole
again
very
well
said
mole
cricket
that
kind
of
you
i
sure
and
now
if
you
want
to
make
me
quite
happy
there
one
more
thing
to
which
you
will
agree
what
that
chirpy
cricket
asked
he
felt
sorry
for
mole
cricket
who
had
never
known
the
pleasure
of
fiddling
with
a
thousand
other
musicians
under
the
stars
on
a
warm
summer
night
if
there
is
anything
i
can
do
to
make
you
happy
just
tell
me
then
call
me
mole
cricket
begged
him
chirpy
cricket
cast
one
glance
at
mole
cricket
huge
feet
in
spite
of
everything
their
owner
had
told
him
chirpy
still
found
it
difficult
to
believe
that
mole
cricket
could
be
even
a
very
distant
relation
i
do
it
he
said
at
last
if
it
will
make
you
any
happier
i
call
you
though
you
ca
be
any
nearer
than
a
hundred
times
removed
it
was
easy
to
see
that
mole
cricket
was
delighted
thank
you
thank
you
he
exclaimed
but
permit
me
to
correct
you
your
cousin
a
good
many
thousand
times
removed
but
that
no
reason
why
we
should
be
the
best
of
friends
and
now
he
added
wo
you
come
home
with
me
i
like
you
to
meet
my
wife
while
thanking
him
for
the
invitation
chirpy
cricket
could
help
wondering
whether
mole
cricket
wife
had
as
big
feet
as
her
husband
xiv
chirpy
is
careful
do
you
live
chirpy
cricket
inquired
of
mole
cricket
who
had
just
invited
him
to
his
home
to
meet
his
wife
my
home
is
not
very
far
from
here
his
new
cousin
said
we
go
back
through
this
tunnel
i
been
making
the
other
end
of
it
opens
into
my
dwelling
some
distance
below
the
surface
of
the
garden
follow
me
and
you
have
no
trouble
finding
it
but
somehow
chirpy
cricket
did
not
quite
like
the
idea
of
travelling
with
the
stranger
cousin
though
he
might
be
under
farmer
green
garden
not
he
said
politely
i
have
had
anything
to
eat
since
last
night
and
i
do
feel
like
taking
a
journey
we
snatch
a
bite
on
the
way
to
my
house
mole
cricket
suggested
cheerfully
i
dig
out
a
few
juicy
roots
for
you
which
kind
do
you
like
best
beet
turnip
or
carrot
i
do
like
any
of
them
chirpy
cricket
confessed
you
do
his
cousin
cried
as
if
he
were
astonished
to
hear
that
what
do
you
live
on
then
grass
chirpy
answered
i
never
heard
of
it
said
mole
cricket
and
i
must
say
you
have
queer
tastes
even
though
you
are
my
own
cousin
chirpy
cricket
saw
that
he
and
mole
cricket
were
bound
to
have
trouble
if
they
saw
too
much
of
each
other
so
he
hinted
in
a
delicate
way
that
mole
cricket
wife
must
be
wondering
where
he
was
thereupon
that
gentleman
started
up
hurriedly
and
made
for
his
tunnel
i
see
you
again
sometime
he
said
hastily
over
his
shoulder
and
in
another
instant
he
was
gone
they
never
met
again
chirpy
cricket
took
great
pains
never
to
spend
another
day
in
hiding
in
farmer
green
garden
he
was
afraid
there
might
be
trouble
if
he
saw
more
of
his
cousin
and
he
could
forget
those
powerful
forelegs
and
enormous
feet
of
mole
cricket
they
looked
very
dangerous
the
longer
chirpy
pondered
over
his
brief
meeting
with
mole
cricket
the
more
firmly
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
had
been
in
great
danger
and
that
he
had
been
lucky
to
escape
alive
everybody
knew
that
grandfather
mole
was
a
person
when
aroused
he
would
rush
at
anybody
big
or
little
perhaps
that
was
because
he
could
see
what
sized
person
he
was
attacking
for
grandfather
mole
was
blind
but
he
never
stopped
to
inquire
of
anybody
whether
he
was
tall
or
short
thick
or
thin
he
just
went
ahead
without
asking
i
glad
thought
chirpy
that
i
did
go
home
with
mole
cricket
if
his
wife
feet
are
anything
like
his
they
be
a
fearful
pair
to
quarrel
with
and
even
if
they
had
quarrelled
with
me
they
might
have
had
trouble
between
themselves
and
if
i
happened
to
get
in
their
way
it
would
certainly
have
gone
hard
with
me
harmless
mole
cricket
never
knew
what
a
monster
his
cousin
chirpy
cricket
believed
him
to
be
when
he
reached
home
he
told
his
wife
that
he
had
met
a
queer
little
cousin
who
spent
much
of
his
time
above
ground
and
lived
on
grass
but
mole
cricket
would
believe
him
she
told
him
not
to
be
silly
she
even
said
that
there
was
any
such
thing
as
grass
and
she
asked
him
how
anybody
could
live
on
it
when
there
was
any
anywhere
naturally
she
would
have
talked
like
that
if
she
had
ever
seen
much
of
the
world
but
she
had
spent
her
whole
life
down
in
the
dirt
beneath
farmer
green
garden
xv
tommy
tree
cricket
after
meeting
that
odd
mole
cricket
who
claimed
to
be
his
cousin
chirpy
cricket
tried
to
find
out
more
about
him
from
his
nearer
relations
but
there
was
one
that
had
ever
seen
or
heard
of
such
a
person
one
night
chirpy
even
travelled
quite
a
distance
to
call
on
tommy
tree
cricket
with
the
hope
that
perhaps
tommy
might
be
able
to
tell
him
something
chirpy
found
tommy
tree
cricket
in
the
tangle
of
raspberry
bushes
beyond
the
garden
it
was
not
hard
to
tell
where
he
was
because
he
was
a
famous
fiddler
he
played
a
tune
that
was
different
from
chirpy
tommy
tree
cricket
fiddled
and
many
considered
him
a
much
finer
musician
than
chirpy
himself
he
was
small
and
pale
beside
chirpy
cricket
who
was
all
but
black
tommy
tree
cricket
looked
decidedly
delicate
but
he
could
fiddle
all
night
without
getting
tired
i
come
all
the
way
from
the
yard
to
have
a
chat
with
you
chirpy
called
to
his
cousin
tommy
come
up
and
have
a
seat
said
tommy
tree
cricket
i
can
find
one
here
thank
you
chirpy
answered
oh
do
sit
on
the
damp
ground
tommy
cried
that
a
dangerous
thing
to
do
chirpy
cricket
smiled
to
himself
in
a
way
tommy
tree
cricket
was
queer
he
always
clung
to
trees
and
shrubs
claiming
that
it
was
much
more
healthful
to
live
off
the
ground
but
he
was
so
pale
that
chirpy
cricket
was
sure
he
was
mistaken
the
ground
good
enough
for
me
chirpy
told
his
cousin
well
we
wo
quarrel
about
that
tonight
said
tommy
tree
cricket
sit
there
if
you
will
and
when
i
finished
playing
this
tune
have
a
talk
i
only
hope
you
wo
catch
cold
while
you
waiting
down
there
ca
you
stop
fiddling
long
enough
to
talk
with
me
now
chirpy
asked
him
i
come
here
to
ask
you
whether
you
ever
saw
a
cousin
of
ours
called
mole
cricket
tommy
tree
cricket
was
already
fiddling
away
as
if
it
were
the
last
night
of
the
summer
he
was
making
so
much
shrill
music
that
he
could
hear
a
word
chirpy
said
the
more
chirpy
tried
to
attract
his
attention
the
harder
he
played
rolling
his
eyes
in
every
direction
except
that
of
his
caller
several
times
chirpy
cricket
leaped
into
the
air
hoping
that
tommy
tree
cricket
would
see
that
he
had
something
important
to
say
but
tommy
paid
not
the
slightest
heed
to
him
at
last
chirpy
decided
that
he
might
as
well
do
a
little
fiddling
himself
to
pass
the
time
away
so
he
began
his
and
then
tommy
noticed
him
immediately
you
playing
the
wrong
tune
he
cried
it
chirpy
cricket
thought
that
his
cousin
face
was
slightly
darker
as
if
a
flush
of
annoyance
had
come
over
it
he
certainly
did
want
to
quarrel
with
tommy
tree
cricket
so
he
said
to
him
very
mildly
i
fear
you
do
not
like
my
playing
i
ca
say
that
i
do
said
tommy
it
makes
me
think
of
that
creaking
pump
at
the
farmhouse
and
of
what
chirpy
cricket
stammered
of
what
pray
does
your
own
fiddling
remind
you
ah
said
tommy
my
own
music
is
like
nothing
in
the
world
except
the
sound
of
a
shimmering
moonbeam
there
is
no
doubt
that
tommy
tree
cricket
thought
very
well
of
his
own
fiddling
xvi
a
long
wait
chirpy
cricket
was
so
that
he
would
quarrel
with
his
cousin
tommy
tree
cricket
although
tommy
had
said
bluntly
that
fiddling
reminded
him
of
farmer
green
creaking
pump
chirpy
made
no
disagreeable
answer
he
did
not
want
to
hurt
his
pale
cousin
feelings
after
making
his
rude
remark
tommy
tree
cricket
began
his
once
more
he
shuffled
his
wings
together
at
a
faster
rate
than
ever
as
if
he
had
to
furnish
all
the
music
for
the
night
as
before
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
all
about
his
caller
for
chirpy
still
waited
beneath
the
raspberry
bush
where
tommy
tree
cricket
was
fiddling
but
if
tommy
paid
no
heed
to
chirpy
there
was
a
reason
why
near
tommy
sat
a
pale
young
miss
of
his
own
sort
who
listened
with
great
enjoyment
to
his
playing
or
at
least
she
acted
as
if
she
thought
it
the
most
beautiful
music
in
the
whole
world
tommy
tree
cricket
was
not
so
intent
upon
his
fiddling
that
he
roll
his
eyes
towards
his
fair
listener
and
chirpy
was
not
slow
to
understand
that
it
was
for
her
that
tommy
was
playing
his
i
wait
here
until
he
rests
chirpy
said
to
himself
then
i
ask
him
again
what
he
knows
about
mole
cricket
well
chirpy
waited
and
waited
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
as
the
night
lengthened
tommy
tree
cricket
fiddled
all
the
faster
and
if
the
weather
had
turned
colder
along
toward
morning
probably
he
would
have
had
a
chance
to
speak
to
tommy
again
anyhow
a
cool
wind
began
to
whip
around
the
side
of
blue
mountain
and
sweep
through
pleasant
valley
and
the
moment
it
struck
tommy
tree
cricket
he
began
to
play
more
slowly
little
by
little
a
longer
pause
crept
between
his
and
at
last
the
pale
miss
beside
him
cried
i
hope
you
not
going
to
stop
your
beautiful
fiddling
i
fear
i
have
to
tommy
told
her
with
a
sigh
i
beginning
to
feel
a
bit
stiff
with
this
north
wind
blowing
on
me
this
was
chirpy
cricket
chance
please
he
called
will
you
listen
to
me
a
moment
what
have
you
come
back
again
tommy
tree
cricket
sang
out
no
i
been
here
all
the
time
chirpy
explained
i
been
waiting
for
hours
to
have
a
talk
with
you
very
well
tommy
answered
it
too
cold
for
me
to
fiddle
any
more
so
talk
away
and
you
better
be
quick
about
it
for
the
night
almost
gone
but
somehow
chirpy
cricket
felt
that
his
chat
could
wait
a
little
longer
if
the
pale
young
person
clinging
to
the
raspberry
bush
near
tommy
tree
cricket
loved
music
he
thought
it
was
a
pity
to
disappoint
her
you
may
feel
too
cold
to
fiddle
but
i
do
chirpy
said
i
quite
warm
down
here
on
the
ground
this
little
hollow
where
i
sitting
is
sheltered
from
the
wind
so
i
fiddle
for
your
friend
as
he
spoke
he
began
to
play
looks
as
of
great
pain
came
over
the
pale
faces
of
his
two
listeners
in
the
raspberry
bush
and
they
shuddered
so
violently
that
they
had
to
cling
tightly
to
their
seats
to
keep
from
falling
my
friend
thanks
you
but
she
says
she
does
care
for
your
fiddling
tommy
tree
cricket
called
down
to
chirpy
she
says
it
too
squeaky
chirpy
cricket
was
fiddling
so
hard
by
that
time
that
he
never
heard
a
word
and
when
he
stopped
at
last
to
rest
a
bit
a
voice
cried
out
that
fine
wo
you
play
some
more
chirpy
cricket
was
pleased
he
thought
of
course
that
it
was
friend
speaking
to
him
but
when
he
looked
up
he
could
see
her
anywhere
nor
her
companion
either
they
had
both
disappeared
and
it
was
already
gray
in
the
east
xvii
sitting
on
a
though
chirpy
cricket
looked
all
around
with
great
care
he
discover
who
had
spoken
to
him
a
voice
from
somewhere
had
called
out
that
his
music
was
fine
and
asked
him
if
he
would
play
some
more
whoever
the
owner
of
the
voice
might
be
it
was
plain
that
he
liked
music
so
without
knowing
for
whom
he
was
playing
chirpy
began
to
fiddle
again
and
when
he
stopped
the
same
voice
cried
thank
you
very
much
now
the
was
and
at
first
chirpy
had
thought
of
looking
there
for
his
listener
but
the
second
time
he
heard
the
voice
he
guessed
that
it
came
from
the
pond
so
chirpy
leaped
to
the
water
edge
and
there
sitting
on
a
was
the
tiniest
frog
he
had
ever
seen
he
seemed
no
bigger
than
chirpy
himself
how
do
you
do
chirpy
said
to
him
was
it
you
that
spoke
to
me
yes
the
stranger
said
i
been
enjoying
your
music
and
i
glad
to
meet
you
it
time
we
knew
each
other
living
as
we
do
in
the
same
neighborhood
my
name
is
cricket
frog
and
may
i
inquire
what
yours
is
i
called
chirpy
cricket
said
the
fiddler
on
the
bank
is
it
possible
do
you
think
that
we
are
cousins
no
said
cricket
frog
no
i
belong
to
a
branch
of
the
tree
frog
family
but
somehow
i
never
cared
to
live
in
trees
indeed
i
never
climbed
a
tree
in
all
my
life
you
a
sensible
person
chirpy
cricket
cried
he
did
not
know
that
the
reason
why
cricket
frog
stayed
on
the
ground
was
because
his
feet
were
not
suited
to
climbing
trees
he
could
have
got
up
a
tree
if
he
had
tried
are
you
afraid
of
falling
off
that
into
the
water
chirpy
asked
his
new
friend
it
seems
to
me
you
have
picked
out
a
safe
place
at
all
he
had
scarcely
finished
speaking
when
he
had
a
great
fright
for
cricket
frog
did
not
answer
him
instead
he
leaped
suddenly
into
the
air
and
chirpy
cricket
feared
that
he
would
fall
into
the
water
and
be
drowned
but
when
cricket
frog
came
down
again
he
landed
squarely
upon
another
i
caught
him
he
said
pleasantly
chirpy
cricket
had
no
idea
what
he
was
talking
about
whom
did
you
catch
he
asked
the
fly
cricket
frog
replied
do
you
think
you
took
a
great
risk
leaping
above
the
water
like
that
chirpy
inquired
are
you
worried
for
fear
you
fall
into
the
pond
some
day
if
you
jump
for
flies
in
that
careless
fashion
cricket
frog
tried
not
to
smile
bless
you
he
exclaimed
i
spend
half
my
time
in
the
water
please
do
think
i
boasting
when
i
say
i
a
fine
swimmer
you
understand
why
when
you
look
at
my
feet
and
he
held
up
a
foot
so
that
chirpy
cricket
might
see
it
chirpy
noticed
that
there
were
webs
between
cricket
frog
toes
and
everybody
knows
that
webbed
feet
are
the
best
for
swimming
cricket
frog
wanted
to
be
agreeable
would
you
like
to
see
me
swim
he
asked
yes
thank
you
chirpy
replied
so
cricket
frog
leaped
nimbly
into
the
water
and
began
to
swim
among
the
while
chirpy
watched
him
and
admired
his
skill
all
at
once
chirpy
heard
a
splash
and
he
was
just
about
to
ask
cricket
frog
what
it
could
be
when
he
noticed
something
queer
about
his
new
friend
he
was
no
longer
swimming
he
was
floating
motionless
upon
the
water
not
by
a
single
movement
of
any
kind
did
he
show
that
he
was
alive
xviii
cricket
frog
trick
what
the
matter
are
you
hurt
chirpy
cricket
called
to
cricket
frog
from
the
bank
of
the
ever
since
a
splash
had
interrupted
their
talk
cricket
frog
had
not
swum
a
single
stroke
he
was
floating
motionless
upon
the
surface
of
the
water
and
he
made
no
reply
whatever
to
chirpy
questions
he
acted
exactly
as
if
he
had
not
heard
them
the
fitful
breeze
caught
at
cricket
frog
limp
form
and
wafted
it
about
chirpy
cricket
could
help
being
alarmed
and
yet
he
almost
thought
for
a
moment
that
he
saw
cricket
frog
eyes
rolling
in
his
direction
as
he
stood
on
the
bank
of
the
pond
if
cricket
frog
was
in
trouble
chirpy
knew
of
no
way
to
help
him
and
after
a
time
he
made
up
his
mind
that
cricket
frog
was
beyond
anybody
help
chirpy
was
about
to
go
back
to
the
farmyard
when
cricket
frog
came
suddenly
to
life
meet
me
here
he
called
then
he
dived
to
the
bottom
of
the
water
and
chirpy
cricket
went
home
thinking
that
it
was
all
very
queer
what
happened
to
you
yesterday
chirpy
asked
cricket
frog
when
he
came
back
to
the
the
following
day
and
found
that
spry
little
gentleman
waiting
for
him
on
a
were
you
ill
oh
no
cricket
frog
answered
when
i
heard
a
splash
behind
me
i
did
know
who
made
it
so
i
played
dead
for
a
while
and
after
waiting
until
i
felt
somewhat
safer
i
went
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
pond
and
hid
in
the
mud
i
found
that
it
always
wise
to
attract
as
little
attention
as
possible
when
i
do
know
who
lurking
about
i
hope
you
did
think
i
was
rude
he
added
no
chirpy
told
him
but
i
been
upset
ever
since
i
saw
you
i
have
had
the
heart
to
fiddle
dear
me
cricket
frog
cried
i
must
do
something
to
cheer
you
up
i
sing
you
a
song
then
cricket
frog
puffed
out
his
yellow
throat
and
began
to
sing
and
he
gave
chirpy
cricket
a
great
surprise
for
his
singing
was
so
like
chirpy
fiddling
that
chirpy
thought
for
a
moment
he
was
making
the
sound
himself
but
there
was
one
marked
difference
cricket
frog
time
was
not
like
his
it
was
not
regular
cricket
frog
began
to
sing
somewhat
slowly
and
gradually
sang
faster
and
faster
after
he
had
sung
about
thirty
notes
he
would
pause
to
get
his
breath
and
then
he
would
begin
again
exactly
as
before
cricket
frog
had
sung
long
before
chirpy
spirits
began
to
rise
indeed
he
soon
felt
so
cheerful
that
he
began
to
fiddle
and
between
the
two
they
made
such
a
chirping
that
an
old
drake
swam
across
the
to
see
what
was
going
on
of
course
his
curiosity
put
an
end
to
the
concert
cricket
frog
saw
him
coming
and
this
time
he
did
stop
to
play
dead
he
sank
in
a
great
hurry
to
the
bottom
of
the
pond
chirpy
cricket
wondered
why
his
friend
chose
to
stay
in
a
place
where
there
were
so
many
interruptions
i
should
think
he
said
to
himself
cricket
frog
would
rather
live
in
a
hole
in
the
ground
as
i
do
i
must
ask
him
when
i
see
him
again
why
he
does
move
to
the
farmyard
cricket
frog
was
very
polite
later
when
chirpy
spoke
to
him
about
moving
but
he
explained
that
he
was
too
fond
of
swimming
to
do
that
and
besides
he
thought
his
voice
sounded
better
on
water
than
it
did
on
land
xix
it
was
thunder
quite
often
during
the
nightly
concerts
in
which
chirpy
cricket
took
part
he
had
noticed
an
odd
cry
peent
which
seemed
to
come
from
the
woods
and
sometimes
there
followed
from
the
same
direction
a
hollow
booming
sound
as
if
somebody
were
amusing
himself
by
blowing
across
the
of
an
empty
barrel
chirpy
cricket
had
a
great
curiosity
to
know
who
made
those
queer
noises
he
asked
everybody
he
met
about
them
and
at
last
kiddie
katydid
told
him
that
it
was
nighthawk
that
he
had
heard
he
seems
to
think
he
a
musician
said
chirpy
cricket
but
i
must
say
i
do
care
much
for
his
music
he
not
what
you
might
call
a
steady
player
and
his
notes
are
not
shrill
enough
for
my
liking
perhaps
he
lacks
training
i
be
glad
to
take
him
in
hand
and
see
what
i
could
do
with
him
tell
me
does
he
ever
visit
our
neighborhood
not
often
said
kiddie
katydid
i
met
him
here
once
and
that
was
enough
for
me
i
never
felt
more
uncomfortable
in
all
my
life
he
shuddered
as
he
spoke
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
somehow
chirpy
cricket
did
not
share
kiddie
katydid
uneasiness
the
more
he
thought
about
nighthawk
the
more
he
wanted
to
meet
him
if
you
ever
see
nighthawk
again
i
wish
you
tell
him
i
want
to
talk
with
him
chirpy
said
i
do
so
kiddie
katydid
promised
and
now
let
me
give
you
a
bit
of
advice
when
you
meet
nighthawk
keep
perfectly
still
he
a
hungry
fellow
always
on
the
for
somebody
to
eat
but
he
has
one
peculiar
habit
he
wo
grab
you
unless
you
moving
through
the
air
he
always
takes
his
food
on
the
wing
chirpy
thanked
his
friend
kiddie
katydid
for
this
valuable
bit
of
news
and
he
said
he
be
sure
to
remember
it
well
kiddie
katydid
observed
if
you
forget
it
when
you
meet
nighthawk
you
forget
it
only
once
for
he
grab
you
quick
as
a
flash
chirpy
cricket
pondered
a
good
deal
over
the
talk
he
had
with
kiddie
katydid
it
was
clear
that
nighthawk
was
a
dangerous
person
perhaps
chirpy
thought
perhaps
if
i
could
get
him
to
take
a
greater
interest
in
his
music
he
would
be
so
ferocious
yes
i
feel
sure
that
if
i
could
only
persuade
him
to
practice
that
booming
sound
it
would
give
nighthawk
something
pleasant
to
think
of
who
knows
but
that
he
might
become
as
gentle
as
i
am
chirpy
cricket
liked
that
notion
so
much
that
he
thought
of
little
else
he
even
began
to
consider
making
a
journey
to
the
woods
where
nighthawk
lived
in
order
to
meet
that
gentleman
and
offer
to
train
him
to
be
a
better
musician
and
at
last
chirpy
had
even
decided
to
go
as
soon
as
the
moon
should
be
full
he
spent
much
of
his
time
listening
for
nighthawk
peent
which
now
and
then
came
faintly
across
the
meadow
and
the
dull
muffled
that
often
followed
while
chirpy
waited
for
the
moon
to
grow
full
one
night
an
odd
thing
happened
the
stars
twinkled
overhead
there
was
a
cloud
in
the
sky
yet
all
at
once
a
loud
startled
chirpy
cricket
and
made
him
leap
suddenly
towards
home
goodness
he
cried
to
kiddie
katydid
who
happened
to
be
near
him
did
you
hear
the
thunder
that
was
thunder
kiddie
said
and
you
better
not
jump
like
that
again
nighthawk
is
here
he
made
that
sound
himself
xx
bound
to
be
different
nothing
ever
surprised
chirpy
cricket
more
than
what
kiddie
katydid
told
him
he
had
thought
it
was
thunder
that
he
had
just
heard
but
it
was
nighthawk
making
that
odd
booming
sound
of
his
it
was
ever
so
much
louder
than
chirpy
had
supposed
it
could
be
he
had
never
heard
it
so
near
before
for
a
moment
chirpy
thought
that
perhaps
kiddie
katydid
did
know
what
he
was
talking
about
but
no
there
was
nighthawk
call
peent
there
was
no
denying
that
it
was
his
voice
he
always
talked
through
his
nose
or
so
it
sounded
and
one
could
mistake
it
chirpy
cricket
began
to
think
that
after
all
he
would
rather
not
have
a
talk
with
nighthawk
he
certainly
sounded
terrible
meanwhile
nighthawk
alighted
in
a
tree
right
over
chirpy
head
and
settled
himself
lengthwise
along
a
limb
he
was
indeed
an
odd
person
he
liked
to
be
different
from
other
folk
and
just
because
other
birds
sat
crosswise
on
a
perch
nighthawk
had
to
sit
in
exactly
the
opposite
fashion
no
doubt
if
he
could
have
he
would
have
hung
underneath
the
limb
by
his
heels
like
benjamin
bat
only
he
would
have
wanted
to
hang
by
his
nose
instead
of
his
heels
in
order
to
be
different
has
anybody
seen
chirpy
cricket
nighthawk
sang
out
he
on
the
ground
under
that
tree
you
in
kiddie
katydid
informed
him
kiddie
never
moved
as
he
spoke
but
clung
closely
to
a
twig
in
the
bush
where
he
was
hiding
being
green
himself
he
hardly
thought
that
nighthawk
would
be
able
to
discover
him
amongst
shrubbery
of
the
same
color
chirpy
cricket
wished
that
kiddie
katydid
had
replied
to
nighthawk
at
all
but
how
could
kiddie
know
that
chirpy
had
changed
his
mind
and
now
nighthawk
spoke
to
chirpy
i
ca
see
you
very
well
cricket
he
said
wo
you
leap
into
the
air
a
few
times
so
i
can
get
a
good
look
at
you
i
heard
that
you
been
wanting
to
meet
me
and
i
come
all
the
way
from
the
woods
just
to
please
you
luckily
chirpy
cricket
did
not
forget
kiddie
katydid
advice
kiddie
had
explained
to
him
how
nighthawk
caught
his
meals
on
the
wing
you
have
to
excuse
me
chirpy
told
nighthawk
i
rather
not
do
any
jumping
for
you
that
was
why
i
wanted
to
meet
you
ha
said
nighthawk
then
why
pray
did
you
wish
to
see
me
i
thought
chirpy
cricket
replied
i
thought
that
perhaps
you
like
me
to
help
you
with
your
music
i
often
heard
your
booming
at
a
distance
and
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
you
have
the
making
of
a
good
musician
if
you
have
a
good
teacher
nighthawk
sniffed
it
must
be
remembered
that
he
was
not
very
gentlemanly
i
had
plenty
of
training
he
said
i
did
come
all
the
way
from
the
woods
to
be
told
that
i
do
know
my
own
business
i
practice
every
night
and
i
flatter
myself
that
i
a
perfect
performer
then
said
chirpy
cricket
perhaps
you
need
a
new
fiddle
for
no
doubt
that
your
booming
would
sound
much
better
if
it
were
shriller
nighthawk
gave
a
rude
laugh
i
do
make
that
sound
with
a
fiddle
he
sneered
do
you
know
a
wind
instrument
when
you
hear
it
xxi
nighthawk
explains
nighthawk
appeared
to
think
it
a
great
joke
on
chirpy
cricket
because
chirpy
had
thought
he
played
the
fiddle
he
laughed
in
a
most
disagreeable
fashion
and
he
kept
repeating
that
people
who
did
know
a
wind
instrument
when
they
heard
it
could
know
much
about
music
as
for
chirpy
he
did
know
just
what
to
say
but
at
last
he
managed
to
stammer
that
he
hoped
he
had
offended
nighthawk
not
at
all
nighthawk
told
him
this
is
the
funniest
thing
heard
for
a
long
time
it
was
worth
coming
all
the
way
from
the
woods
to
enjoy
a
laugh
over
it
of
course
it
was
very
rude
for
nighthawk
to
speak
in
such
a
way
but
he
was
never
polite
to
any
of
the
smaller
unless
he
happened
to
be
coaxing
them
to
jump
so
that
he
might
grab
them
when
they
were
in
the
air
you
may
be
sure
he
was
as
meek
as
he
could
be
if
he
happened
to
meet
solomon
owl
but
at
that
moment
solomon
was
far
off
in
the
hemlock
woods
only
a
short
time
before
nighthawk
had
heard
his
rolling
call
in
the
distance
so
he
felt
quite
safe
in
bullying
so
gentle
a
creature
as
chirpy
cricket
thinking
that
he
ought
to
be
polite
to
his
caller
rude
as
he
was
chirpy
asked
nighthawk
if
he
would
kindly
play
something
i
do
care
if
i
do
said
nighthawk
meaning
that
he
care
and
that
he
play
something
but
it
was
not
because
he
wanted
to
oblige
anybody
he
was
proud
of
his
booming
and
he
was
only
too
glad
of
a
chance
to
show
chirpy
cricket
how
loud
he
could
make
it
sound
stay
right
there
in
that
tree
if
you
will
chirpy
said
i
wo
move
i
sit
here
and
listen
ha
ha
nighthawk
laughed
i
you
did
know
anything
about
wind
instruments
when
i
make
that
booming
sound
i
always
on
the
wing
i
going
to
take
a
flight
now
and
when
i
come
back
you
hear
a
noise
that
is
a
noise
and
not
a
squeaky
chirp
then
nighthawk
left
his
perch
and
climbed
up
into
the
sky
and
when
he
had
risen
high
enough
to
suit
him
he
dropped
like
a
stone
it
seemed
to
chirpy
cricket
that
he
had
never
heard
anything
so
loud
as
the
that
broke
not
far
above
his
head
soon
afterward
at
the
very
moment
when
it
looked
as
if
nighthawk
must
dash
himself
to
pieces
upon
the
ground
right
where
chirpy
cricket
crouched
and
trembled
he
had
spread
his
wings
and
checked
his
fall
it
was
the
air
rushing
through
his
with
great
force
that
made
the
queer
hollow
sound
that
was
why
nighthawk
claimed
that
he
made
the
booming
on
a
wind
instrument
there
he
said
when
he
had
settled
himself
in
the
tree
once
more
if
you
think
you
can
teach
me
to
perform
better
just
try
that
trick
yourself
but
chirpy
cricket
said
that
he
was
sure
nighthawk
performance
could
be
bettered
by
anybody
and
he
remarked
that
the
noise
reminded
him
of
a
high
wind
coming
on
top
of
a
thunder
storm
that
pleased
nighthawk
it
the
greatest
praise
i
ever
had
he
declared
and
before
chirpy
cricket
knew
what
had
happened
nighthawk
had
flown
away
chirpy
often
wondered
why
he
left
so
suddenly
the
truth
was
that
nighthawk
had
hurried
back
to
the
woods
to
tell
his
wife
what
chirpy
cricket
had
said
to
him
and
ever
afterward
he
was
fond
of
repeating
chirpy
remark
in
a
boasting
way
until
his
neighbors
were
heartily
tired
of
hearing
it
xxii
harmless
meadow
mouse
one
night
when
chirpy
cricket
was
fiddling
his
prettiest
not
far
from
the
fence
between
the
farmyard
and
the
meadow
he
had
a
queer
feeling
as
if
somebody
were
gazing
at
him
and
glancing
up
quickly
he
saw
that
a
plump
person
sat
on
a
busily
engaged
in
staring
at
him
do
chirpy
cricket
piped
for
the
fat
person
looked
both
cheerful
and
harmless
i
take
it
you
fond
of
music
the
stranger
whose
name
was
meadow
mouse
smiled
i
wo
dispute
your
statement
he
said
perhaps
you
play
some
instrument
yourself
chirpy
observed
but
meadow
mouse
shook
his
head
no
he
replied
no
to
tell
the
truth
i
have
much
time
for
that
sort
of
thing
besides
it
seems
to
me
somewhat
dangerous
i
was
wondering
while
i
watched
you
whether
you
were
likely
to
fiddle
yourself
into
bits
you
were
working
so
hard
chirpy
cricket
assured
him
that
there
was
the
least
danger
all
my
family
are
famous
fiddlers
he
said
and
i
never
heard
of
such
an
accident
happening
to
any
of
them
meadow
mouse
appeared
to
be
slightly
disappointed
i
thought
he
said
i
could
pick
up
the
pieces
for
you
in
case
you
fell
apart
dark
as
he
was
chirpy
cricket
almost
turned
pale
you
you
were
intending
to
to
swallow
the
pieces
were
you
he
stammered
dear
me
no
meadow
mouse
gasped
i
what
known
as
a
vegetarian
well
when
he
heard
that
chirpy
cricket
made
ready
to
jump
out
of
the
stranger
way
he
did
know
what
a
vegetarian
was
but
it
sounded
terrible
to
him
meadow
mouse
must
have
guessed
that
chirpy
was
uneasy
anyhow
he
hastened
to
explain
that
a
vegetarian
was
one
that
ate
only
food
that
grew
on
plants
of
one
kind
or
another
i
live
for
the
most
part
on
seeds
and
grain
he
said
so
you
see
quite
harmless
chirpy
cricket
told
him
that
he
was
glad
to
know
it
i
a
vegetarian
myself
he
added
proudly
for
i
eat
blades
of
grass
and
you
see
i
harmless
too
meadow
mouse
bestowed
another
fat
smile
on
him
then
he
said
it
must
be
quite
safe
for
me
to
stay
here
and
talk
with
you
chirpy
cricket
did
know
why
the
plump
gentleman
was
smiling
unless
it
was
because
he
felt
easy
in
his
mind
chirpy
could
help
liking
him
he
was
so
friendly
i
play
my
favorite
tune
for
you
if
you
wish
chirpy
offered
being
eager
to
do
something
pleasant
for
his
new
acquaintance
do
said
meadow
mouse
and
make
it
as
lively
as
you
please
for
i
just
dined
well
and
i
in
a
very
cheerful
mood
so
chirpy
cricket
began
his
while
meadow
mouse
moved
nearer
and
watched
him
closely
after
a
time
he
began
to
fidget
and
at
last
he
asked
chirpy
if
he
would
please
be
still
for
a
moment
because
there
was
something
he
wanted
to
say
chirpy
stopped
fiddling
i
notice
said
meadow
mouse
that
you
having
some
trouble
tuning
up
your
fiddle
so
if
you
do
mind
i
go
over
in
the
cornfield
on
a
matter
of
business
and
come
back
here
later
then
no
doubt
be
all
ready
to
play
a
tune
for
me
chirpy
cricket
had
to
explain
that
he
had
been
playing
a
tune
all
the
time
that
he
always
played
on
one
note
so
meadow
mouse
stayed
and
heard
more
of
the
fiddling
he
begged
chirpy
pardon
for
his
mistake
and
he
said
that
if
he
only
had
a
fiddle
he
should
like
to
learn
the
same
tune
himself
although
he
added
it
must
be
very
difficult
to
play
always
on
the
same
note
it
must
take
a
great
deal
of
practice
xxiii
a
wail
in
the
dark
there
was
an
odd
cry
that
often
interrupted
the
nightly
concerts
of
the
cricket
family
chirpy
cricket
had
never
heard
it
in
the
daytime
but
when
twilight
began
to
wrap
pleasant
valley
in
its
shadows
the
strange
wailing
call
was
almost
sure
to
come
quavering
through
the
air
somehow
it
always
sent
a
shiver
over
chirpy
and
sometimes
it
made
him
lose
a
few
notes
if
he
happened
to
be
fiddling
when
he
heard
it
he
learned
that
it
was
a
dangerous
bird
known
as
simon
screecher
a
cousin
of
solomon
owl
that
made
this
uncanny
call
if
he
had
lived
like
solomon
across
the
meadow
in
the
hemlock
woods
chirpy
cricket
would
have
paid
less
heed
to
the
noise
he
made
but
simon
screecher
had
his
home
in
a
hollow
apple
tree
in
farmer
green
orchard
it
was
said
by
those
that
claimed
to
know
that
simon
screecher
slept
in
the
daytime
but
every
tiny
the
katydids
and
the
crickets
and
all
the
rest
knew
that
after
sunset
simon
screecher
was
as
wide
awake
as
anybody
it
was
no
wonder
that
chirpy
cricket
was
always
uneasy
when
simon
screeched
his
warning
that
he
was
awake
and
looking
for
his
supper
chirpy
knew
that
he
could
not
depend
on
simon
to
stay
long
in
one
place
though
you
heard
his
screech
in
the
orchard
one
moment
you
might
see
him
in
the
farmyard
soon
afterward
he
never
ate
a
whole
meal
in
just
one
spot
but
preferred
to
move
about
wherever
his
fancy
took
him
simon
himself
said
that
he
could
eat
off
and
on
all
night
long
if
he
kept
moving
somehow
meadow
mouse
had
heard
of
this
saying
of
simon
screecher
you
ought
to
crawl
into
your
hole
under
the
straw
whenever
simon
screecher
is
about
the
neighborhood
he
advised
chirpy
one
evening
when
the
two
chanced
to
meet
near
the
fence
but
simon
is
around
here
every
night
chirpy
replied
if
i
stayed
at
home
from
dusk
till
dawn
i
could
take
part
in
another
concert
all
summer
long
meadow
mouse
said
that
that
would
be
a
great
pity
do
you
suppose
chirpy
asked
him
hopefully
do
you
suppose
i
could
jump
out
of
simon
screecher
reach
if
he
tried
to
catch
me
you
could
find
out
by
trying
said
meadow
mouse
so
chirpy
cricket
began
to
feel
more
cheerful
he
even
fiddled
a
bit
thinking
that
he
had
no
special
reason
to
worry
and
then
all
at
once
he
stopped
making
music
meadow
mouse
had
been
searching
about
on
the
ground
for
seeds
while
he
was
enjoying
chirpy
fiddling
and
when
the
music
came
to
a
sudden
end
he
looked
up
and
saw
that
something
was
troubling
the
fiddler
what
the
matter
now
he
inquired
an
unpleasant
idea
has
just
come
into
my
head
chirpy
told
him
it
would
be
very
unlucky
for
me
if
i
found
that
i
was
spry
enough
to
escape
simon
screecher
meadow
mouse
had
to
admit
that
there
was
a
good
deal
of
truth
in
chirpy
remark
but
he
said
he
was
ready
with
another
suggestion
a
good
one
too
he
declared
what
is
it
chirpy
asked
him
you
have
to
think
of
some
other
way
said
meadow
mouse
some
other
way
of
being
safe
from
simon
screecher
xxiv
frightening
simon
screecher
meadow
mouse
acted
as
if
he
thought
he
had
been
a
great
help
when
he
said
that
chirpy
cricket
would
have
to
think
of
another
way
to
avoid
simon
screecher
cruel
talons
but
the
more
chirpy
turned
the
matter
over
in
his
mind
the
further
he
seemed
to
be
from
any
plan
for
several
days
and
nights
he
puzzled
over
his
problem
and
every
time
he
heard
simon
screecher
unearthly
wail
he
shivered
so
hard
that
his
fiddling
actually
seemed
to
shiver
too
meadow
mouse
inquired
regularly
whether
chirpy
had
hit
upon
any
plan
and
at
last
meadow
mouse
announced
that
he
would
have
to
think
of
one
himself
so
he
sat
down
and
looked
very
wise
while
chirpy
cricket
fiddled
for
him
because
meadow
mouse
explained
that
his
wits
always
worked
better
when
somebody
made
music
for
him
did
you
notice
his
cry
a
little
while
ago
meadow
mouse
asked
did
you
notice
how
his
voice
trembled
yes
chirpy
said
yes
now
that
you
speak
of
it
i
remember
that
his
voice
shook
a
good
deal
ah
meadow
mouse
exclaimed
something
had
frightened
him
now
you
had
just
begun
to
fiddle
before
he
cried
out
and
there
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
your
music
scared
simon
screecher
so
all
you
need
do
to
feel
safe
from
him
is
to
fiddle
a
plenty
every
night
chirpy
cricket
felt
so
happy
all
at
once
that
he
began
a
lively
tune
and
sure
enough
simon
screecher
squalled
almost
immediately
that
proves
it
meadow
mouse
exclaimed
and
then
he
said
good
evening
and
ran
off
to
the
place
where
farmer
green
had
been
threshing
oats
feeling
very
well
pleased
with
himself
chirpy
cricket
took
pains
to
follow
meadow
mouse
advice
and
neither
simon
screecher
nor
his
cousin
solomon
owl
troubled
chirpy
all
the
rest
of
the
summer
he
fiddled
the
nights
away
with
more
pleasure
than
ever
before
and
by
the
time
fall
came
all
his
neighbors
agreed
that
he
had
done
even
more
than
his
part
to
make
the
summer
gay
for
everybody
