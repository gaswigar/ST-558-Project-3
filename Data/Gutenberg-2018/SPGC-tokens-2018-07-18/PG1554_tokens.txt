chapter
i
an
old
monastery
come
deputy
of
the
centre
forward
quick
step
march
if
we
want
to
be
in
time
to
dine
with
the
others
jump
marquis
there
that
s
right
why
you
can
skip
across
a
like
a
deer
these
words
were
said
by
a
huntsman
peacefully
seated
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
of
who
was
finishing
an
havana
cigar
while
waiting
for
his
companion
who
had
lost
his
way
in
the
tangled
underbrush
of
the
wood
at
his
side
four
panting
dogs
were
watching
as
he
did
the
personage
he
addressed
to
understand
how
sarcastic
were
these
exhortations
repeated
at
intervals
we
should
state
that
the
approaching
huntsman
was
a
stout
little
man
whose
protuberant
stomach
was
the
evidence
of
a
truly
ministerial
he
was
struggling
painfully
across
the
furrows
of
a
vast
recently
harvested
the
stubble
of
which
considerably
impeded
him
while
to
add
to
his
other
miseries
the
sun
s
rays
striking
obliquely
on
his
face
collected
an
abundance
of
drops
of
perspiration
absorbed
in
the
effort
to
maintain
his
equilibrium
he
leaned
now
forward
now
back
in
close
imitation
of
the
pitching
of
a
carriage
when
violently
jolted
the
weather
looked
threatening
though
several
spaces
of
blue
sky
still
parted
the
thick
black
clouds
toward
the
horizon
a
flock
of
fleecy
vapors
were
advancing
with
great
rapidity
and
drawing
a
light
gray
curtain
from
east
to
west
as
the
wind
was
acting
only
on
the
upper
region
of
the
air
the
atmosphere
below
it
pressed
down
the
hot
vapors
of
the
earth
surrounded
by
masses
of
tall
trees
the
valley
through
which
the
hunter
struggled
felt
like
a
furnace
parched
and
silent
the
forest
seemed
thirsty
the
birds
even
the
insects
were
voiceless
the
scarcely
waved
those
persons
who
may
still
remember
the
summer
of
can
imagine
the
woes
of
the
poor
deputy
who
was
struggling
along
drenched
in
sweat
to
regain
his
mocking
friend
the
latter
while
smoking
his
cigar
had
calculated
from
the
position
of
the
sun
that
it
must
be
about
five
in
the
afternoon
where
the
devil
are
we
said
the
stout
huntsman
mopping
his
forehead
and
leaning
against
the
trunk
of
a
tree
nearly
opposite
to
his
companion
for
he
felt
unequal
to
the
effort
of
leaping
the
ditch
between
them
that
s
for
me
to
ask
you
said
the
other
laughing
as
he
lay
among
the
tall
brown
brake
which
crowned
the
bank
then
throwing
the
end
of
his
cigar
into
the
ditch
he
cried
out
vehemently
i
swear
by
saint
hubert
that
never
again
will
i
trust
myself
in
unknown
territory
with
a
statesman
though
he
be
like
you
my
dear
d
albon
a
college
but
philippe
have
you
forgotten
your
french
or
have
you
left
your
wits
in
siberia
replied
the
stout
man
casting
a
sorrowfully
comic
look
at
a
about
a
hundred
feet
away
true
true
cried
philippe
seizing
his
gun
and
springing
with
a
bound
into
the
field
and
thence
to
the
post
this
way
d
albon
this
way
he
called
back
to
his
friend
pointing
to
a
broad
paved
path
and
reading
aloud
the
sign
from
baillet
to
we
shall
certainly
find
the
path
to
cassan
which
must
branch
from
this
one
between
here
and
you
are
right
colonel
said
monsieur
d
albon
replacing
upon
his
head
the
cap
with
which
he
had
been
fanning
himself
forward
then
my
respectable
privy
councillor
replied
colonel
philippe
whistling
to
the
dogs
who
seemed
more
willing
to
obey
him
than
the
public
functionary
to
whom
they
belonged
are
you
aware
marquis
said
the
jeering
soldier
that
we
still
have
six
miles
to
go
that
village
over
there
must
be
good
heavens
cried
the
marquis
go
to
cassan
if
you
must
but
you
ll
go
alone
i
prefer
to
stay
here
in
spite
of
the
coming
storm
and
wait
for
the
horse
you
can
send
me
from
the
chateau
you
ve
played
me
a
trick
sucy
we
were
to
have
had
a
nice
little
hunt
not
far
from
cassan
and
beaten
the
coverts
i
know
instead
of
that
you
have
kept
me
running
like
a
hare
since
four
o
clock
this
morning
and
all
i
ve
had
for
breakfast
is
a
cup
of
milk
now
if
you
ever
have
a
petition
before
the
court
i
ll
make
you
lose
it
however
just
your
the
poor
discouraged
huntsman
sat
down
on
a
stone
that
supported
the
signpost
relieved
himself
of
his
gun
and
his
gamebag
and
heaved
a
long
sigh
france
such
are
thy
deputies
exclaimed
colonel
de
sucy
laughing
ah
my
poor
d
albon
if
you
had
been
like
me
six
years
in
the
wilds
of
siberia
he
said
no
more
but
he
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
as
if
that
anguish
were
between
himself
and
god
come
march
on
he
added
if
you
sit
still
you
are
how
can
i
philippe
it
is
an
old
magisterial
habit
to
sit
still
on
my
honor
i
m
tired
out
if
i
had
only
killed
a
hare
the
two
men
presented
a
rather
rare
contrast
the
public
functionary
was
years
of
age
and
seemed
no
more
than
thirty
whereas
the
soldier
was
thirty
and
seemed
forty
at
the
least
both
wore
the
red
rosette
of
the
officers
of
the
legion
of
honor
a
few
spare
locks
of
black
hair
mixed
with
white
like
the
wing
of
a
magpie
escaped
from
the
colonel
s
cap
while
handsome
brown
curls
adorned
the
brow
of
the
statesman
one
was
tall
gallant
and
the
lines
of
his
pallid
face
showed
terrible
passions
or
frightful
griefs
the
other
had
a
face
that
was
brilliant
with
health
and
jovially
worth
of
an
epicurean
both
were
deeply
and
their
high
gaiters
of
tanned
leather
showed
signs
of
the
bogs
and
the
thickets
they
had
just
come
through
come
said
monsieur
de
sucy
let
us
get
on
a
short
hour
s
march
and
we
shall
reach
cassan
in
time
for
a
good
it
is
easy
to
see
you
have
never
loved
replied
the
councillor
with
a
look
that
was
pitifully
comic
you
are
as
relentless
as
article
of
the
penal
philippe
de
sucy
quivered
his
broad
brow
contracted
his
face
became
as
sombre
as
the
skies
above
them
some
memory
of
awful
bitterness
distorted
for
a
moment
his
features
but
he
said
nothing
like
all
strong
men
he
drove
down
his
emotions
to
the
depths
of
his
heart
thinking
perhaps
as
simple
characters
are
apt
to
think
that
there
was
something
immodest
in
unveiling
griefs
when
human
language
can
not
render
their
depths
and
may
only
rouse
the
mockery
of
those
who
do
not
comprehend
them
monsieur
d
albon
had
one
of
those
delicate
natures
which
divine
sorrows
and
are
instantly
sympathetic
to
the
emotion
they
have
involuntarily
aroused
he
respected
his
friend
s
silence
rose
forgot
his
fatigue
and
followed
him
silently
grieved
to
have
touched
a
wound
that
was
evidently
not
healed
some
day
my
friend
said
philippe
pressing
his
hand
and
thanking
him
for
his
mute
repentance
by
a
look
i
will
relate
to
you
my
life
i
can
not
they
continued
their
way
in
silence
when
the
colonel
s
pain
seemed
soothed
the
marquis
resumed
his
fatigue
and
with
the
instinct
or
rather
the
will
of
a
wearied
man
his
eye
took
in
the
very
depths
of
the
forest
he
questioned
the
and
examined
the
branching
paths
hoping
to
discover
some
dwelling
where
he
could
ask
hospitality
arriving
at
a
he
thought
he
noticed
a
slight
smoke
rising
among
the
trees
he
stopped
looked
more
attentively
and
saw
in
the
midst
of
a
vast
copse
the
branches
of
several
a
house
a
house
he
cried
with
the
joy
the
sailor
feels
in
crying
land
then
he
sprang
quickly
into
the
copse
and
the
colonel
who
had
fallen
into
a
deep
reverie
followed
him
mechanically
i
d
rather
get
an
omelet
some
cottage
bread
and
a
chair
here
he
said
than
go
to
cassan
for
sofas
truffles
and
these
words
were
an
exclamation
of
enthusiasm
elicited
from
the
councillor
on
catching
sight
of
a
wall
the
white
towers
of
which
glimmered
in
the
distance
through
the
brown
masses
of
the
tree
trunks
ha
ha
this
looks
to
me
as
if
it
had
once
been
a
priory
cried
the
marquis
as
they
reached
a
very
old
and
blackened
gate
through
which
they
could
see
in
the
midst
of
a
large
park
a
building
constructed
in
the
style
of
the
monasteries
of
old
how
those
rascals
the
monks
knew
how
to
choose
their
sites
this
last
exclamation
was
an
expression
of
surprise
and
pleasure
at
the
poetical
hermitage
which
met
his
eyes
the
house
stood
on
the
slope
of
the
mountain
at
the
summit
of
which
is
the
village
of
nerville
the
great
centennial
oaks
of
the
forest
which
encircled
the
dwelling
made
the
place
an
absolute
solitude
the
main
building
formerly
occupied
by
the
monks
faced
south
the
park
seemed
to
have
about
forty
acres
near
the
house
lay
a
succession
of
green
meadows
charmingly
crossed
by
several
clear
rivulets
with
here
and
there
a
piece
of
water
naturally
placed
without
the
least
apparent
artifice
trees
of
elegant
shape
and
varied
foliage
were
distributed
about
grottos
cleverly
managed
and
massive
terraces
with
dilapidated
steps
and
rusty
railings
gave
a
peculiar
character
to
this
lone
retreat
art
had
harmonized
her
constructions
with
the
picturesque
effects
of
nature
human
passions
seemed
to
die
at
the
feet
of
those
great
trees
which
guarded
this
asylum
from
the
tumult
of
the
world
as
they
shaded
it
from
the
fires
of
the
sun
how
desolate
thought
monsieur
d
albon
observing
the
sombre
expression
which
the
ancient
building
gave
to
the
landscape
gloomy
as
though
a
curse
were
on
it
it
seemed
a
fatal
spot
deserted
by
man
ivy
had
stretched
its
tortuous
muscles
covered
by
its
rich
green
mantle
everywhere
brown
or
green
red
or
yellow
mosses
and
lichen
spread
their
romantic
tints
on
trees
and
seats
and
roofs
and
stones
the
crumbling
were
hollowed
by
rain
defaced
by
time
the
balconies
were
broken
the
terraces
demolished
some
of
the
outside
shutters
hung
from
a
single
hinge
the
rotten
doors
seemed
quite
unable
to
resist
an
assailant
covered
with
shining
tufts
of
mistletoe
the
branches
of
the
neglected
gave
no
sign
of
fruit
grass
grew
in
the
paths
such
ruin
and
desolation
cast
a
weird
poesy
on
the
scene
filling
the
souls
of
the
spectators
with
dreamy
thoughts
a
poet
would
have
stood
there
long
plunged
in
a
melancholy
reverie
admiring
this
disorder
so
full
of
harmony
this
destruction
which
was
not
without
its
grace
suddenly
the
brown
tiles
shone
the
mosses
glittered
fantastic
shadows
danced
upon
the
meadows
and
beneath
the
trees
fading
colors
revived
striking
contrasts
developed
the
foliage
of
the
trees
and
shrubs
defined
itself
more
clearly
in
the
light
then
the
light
went
out
the
landscape
seemed
to
have
spoken
and
now
was
silent
returning
to
its
gloom
or
rather
to
the
soft
sad
tones
of
an
autumnal
twilight
it
is
the
palace
of
the
sleeping
beauty
said
the
marquis
beginning
to
view
the
house
with
the
eyes
of
a
land
owner
i
wonder
to
whom
it
belongs
he
must
be
a
stupid
fellow
not
to
live
in
such
an
exquisite
at
that
instant
a
woman
sprang
from
beneath
a
standing
to
the
right
of
the
gate
and
without
making
any
noise
passed
before
the
marquis
as
rapidly
as
the
shadow
of
a
cloud
this
vision
made
him
mute
with
surprise
why
albon
what
s
the
matter
asked
the
colonel
i
am
rubbing
my
eyes
to
know
if
i
am
asleep
or
awake
replied
the
marquis
with
his
face
close
to
the
iron
rails
as
he
tried
to
get
another
sight
of
the
phantom
she
must
be
beneath
that
he
said
pointing
to
the
foliage
of
a
tree
which
rose
above
the
wall
to
the
left
of
the
gate
she
who
how
can
i
tell
replied
monsieur
d
albon
a
strange
woman
rose
up
there
just
before
me
he
said
in
a
low
voice
she
seemed
to
come
from
the
world
of
shades
rather
than
from
the
land
of
the
living
she
is
so
slender
so
light
so
filmy
she
must
be
diaphanous
her
face
was
as
white
as
milk
her
eyes
her
clothes
her
hair
jet
black
she
looked
at
me
as
she
flitted
by
and
though
i
may
say
i
m
no
coward
that
cold
immovable
look
froze
the
blood
in
my
is
she
pretty
asked
philippe
i
don
t
know
i
could
see
nothing
but
the
eyes
in
that
well
let
the
dinner
at
cassan
go
to
the
devil
cried
the
colonel
suppose
we
stay
here
i
have
a
sudden
childish
desire
to
enter
that
singular
house
do
you
see
those
painted
red
and
the
red
lines
on
the
doors
and
shutters
doesn
t
the
place
look
to
you
as
if
it
belonged
to
the
devil
perhaps
he
inherited
it
from
the
monks
come
let
us
pursue
the
black
and
white
lady
forward
march
cried
philippe
with
forced
gaiety
at
that
instant
the
two
huntsmen
heard
a
cry
that
was
something
like
that
of
a
mouse
caught
in
a
trap
they
listened
the
rustle
of
a
few
shrubs
sounded
in
the
silence
like
the
murmur
of
a
breaking
wave
in
vain
they
listened
for
other
sounds
the
earth
was
dumb
and
kept
the
secret
of
those
light
steps
if
indeed
the
unknown
woman
moved
at
all
it
is
very
singular
said
philippe
as
they
skirted
the
park
wall
the
two
friends
presently
reached
a
path
in
the
forest
which
led
to
the
village
of
chauvry
after
following
this
path
some
way
toward
the
main
road
to
paris
they
came
to
another
iron
gate
which
led
to
the
principal
facade
of
the
mysterious
dwelling
on
this
side
the
dilapidation
and
disorder
of
the
premises
had
reached
their
height
immense
cracks
furrowed
the
walls
of
the
house
which
was
built
on
three
sides
of
a
square
fragments
of
tiles
and
slates
lying
on
the
ground
and
the
dilapidated
condition
of
the
roofs
were
evidence
of
a
total
want
of
care
on
the
part
of
the
owners
the
fruit
had
fallen
from
the
trees
and
lay
rotting
on
the
ground
a
cow
was
feeding
on
the
lawn
and
treading
down
the
flowers
in
the
borders
while
a
goat
browsed
on
the
shoots
of
the
vines
and
munched
the
unripe
grapes
here
all
is
harmony
the
devastation
seems
organized
said
the
colonel
pulling
the
chain
of
a
bell
but
the
bell
was
without
a
clapper
the
huntsmen
heard
nothing
but
the
curiously
sharp
noise
of
a
rusty
spring
though
very
dilapidated
a
little
door
made
in
the
wall
beside
the
iron
gates
resisted
all
their
efforts
to
open
it
well
well
this
is
getting
to
be
exciting
said
de
sucy
to
his
companion
if
i
were
not
a
magistrate
replied
monsieur
d
albon
i
should
think
that
woman
was
a
as
he
said
the
words
the
cow
came
to
the
iron
gate
and
pushed
her
warm
muzzle
towards
them
as
if
she
felt
the
need
of
seeing
human
beings
then
a
woman
if
that
name
could
be
applied
to
the
indefinable
being
who
suddenly
issued
from
a
clump
of
bushes
pulled
away
the
cow
by
its
rope
this
woman
wore
on
her
head
a
red
handkerchief
beneath
which
trailed
long
locks
of
hair
in
color
and
shape
like
the
flax
on
a
distaff
she
wore
no
fichu
a
coarse
woollen
petticoat
in
black
and
gray
stripes
too
short
by
several
inches
exposed
her
legs
she
might
have
belonged
to
some
tribe
of
described
by
cooper
for
her
legs
neck
and
arms
were
the
color
of
brick
no
ray
of
intelligence
enlivened
her
vacant
face
a
few
whitish
hairs
served
her
for
eyebrows
the
eyes
themselves
of
a
dull
blue
were
cold
and
wan
and
her
mouth
was
so
formed
as
to
show
the
teeth
which
were
crooked
but
as
white
as
those
of
a
dog
here
my
good
woman
called
monsieur
de
sucy
she
came
very
slowly
to
the
gate
looking
with
a
silly
expression
at
the
two
huntsmen
the
sight
of
whom
brought
a
forced
and
painful
smile
to
her
face
where
are
we
whose
house
is
this
who
are
you
do
you
belong
here
to
these
questions
and
several
others
which
the
two
friends
alternately
addressed
to
her
she
answered
only
with
guttural
sounds
that
seemed
more
like
the
growl
of
an
animal
than
the
voice
of
a
human
being
she
must
be
deaf
and
dumb
said
the
marquis
cried
the
peasant
woman
ah
i
see
this
is
no
doubt
the
old
monastery
of
the
said
the
marquis
he
renewed
his
questions
but
like
a
capricious
child
the
peasant
woman
colored
played
with
her
wooden
shoe
twisted
the
rope
of
the
cow
which
was
now
feeding
peaceably
and
looked
at
the
two
hunters
examining
every
part
of
their
clothing
then
she
yelped
growled
and
clucked
but
did
not
speak
what
is
your
name
said
philippe
looking
at
her
fixedly
as
if
he
meant
to
mesmerize
her
genevieve
she
said
laughing
with
a
silly
air
the
cow
is
the
most
intelligent
being
we
have
seen
so
far
said
the
marquis
i
shall
fire
my
gun
and
see
if
that
will
being
some
just
as
d
albon
raised
his
gun
the
colonel
stopped
him
with
a
gesture
and
pointed
to
the
form
of
a
woman
probably
the
one
who
had
so
keenly
piqued
his
curiosity
at
this
moment
she
seemed
lost
in
the
deepest
meditation
and
was
coming
with
slow
steps
along
a
distant
pathway
so
that
the
two
friends
had
ample
time
to
examine
her
she
was
dressed
in
a
ragged
gown
of
black
satin
her
long
hair
fell
in
masses
of
curls
over
her
forehead
around
her
shoulders
and
below
her
waist
serving
her
for
a
shawl
accustomed
no
doubt
to
this
disorder
she
seldom
pushed
her
hair
from
her
forehead
and
when
she
did
so
it
was
with
a
sudden
toss
of
her
head
which
only
for
a
moment
cleared
her
forehead
and
eyes
from
the
thick
veil
her
gesture
like
that
of
an
animal
had
a
remarkable
mechanical
precision
the
quickness
of
which
seemed
wonderful
in
a
woman
the
huntsmen
were
amazed
to
see
her
suddenly
leap
up
on
the
branch
of
an
and
sit
there
with
the
ease
of
a
bird
she
gathered
an
apple
and
ate
it
then
she
dropped
to
the
ground
with
the
graceful
ease
we
admire
in
a
squirrel
her
limbs
possessed
an
elasticity
which
took
from
every
movement
the
slightest
appearance
of
effort
or
constraint
she
played
upon
the
turf
rolling
herself
about
like
a
child
then
suddenly
she
flung
her
feet
and
hands
forward
and
lay
at
full
length
on
the
grass
with
the
grace
and
natural
ease
of
a
young
cat
asleep
in
the
sun
thunder
sounded
in
the
distance
and
she
turned
suddenly
rising
on
her
hands
and
knees
with
the
rapidity
of
a
dog
which
hears
a
coming
footstep
the
effects
of
this
singular
attitude
was
to
separate
into
two
heavy
masses
the
volume
of
her
black
hair
which
now
fell
on
either
side
of
her
head
and
allowed
the
two
spectators
to
admire
the
white
shoulders
glistening
like
daisies
in
a
field
and
the
throat
the
perfection
of
which
allowed
them
to
judge
of
the
other
beauties
of
her
figure
suddenly
she
uttered
a
distressful
cry
and
rose
to
her
feet
her
movements
succeeded
each
other
with
such
airiness
and
grace
that
she
seemed
not
a
creature
of
this
world
but
a
daughter
of
the
atmosphere
as
sung
in
the
poems
of
ossian
she
ran
toward
a
piece
of
water
shook
one
of
her
legs
lightly
to
cast
off
her
shoe
and
began
to
dabble
her
foot
white
as
alabaster
in
the
current
admiring
perhaps
the
undulations
she
thus
produced
upon
the
surface
of
the
water
then
she
knelt
down
at
the
edge
of
the
stream
and
amused
herself
like
a
child
in
casting
in
her
long
tresses
and
pulling
them
abruptly
out
to
watch
the
shower
of
drops
that
glittered
down
looking
as
the
sunlight
struck
athwart
them
like
a
chaplet
of
pearls
that
woman
is
mad
cried
the
marquis
a
hoarse
cry
uttered
by
genevieve
seemed
uttered
as
a
warning
to
the
unknown
woman
who
turned
suddenly
throwing
back
her
hair
from
either
side
of
her
face
at
this
instant
the
colonel
and
monsieur
d
albon
could
distinctly
see
her
features
she
herself
perceiving
the
two
friends
sprang
to
the
iron
railing
with
the
lightness
and
rapidity
of
a
deer
adieu
she
said
in
a
soft
harmonious
voice
the
melody
of
which
did
not
convey
the
slightest
feeling
or
the
slightest
thought
monsieur
d
albon
admired
the
long
lashes
of
her
eyelids
the
blackness
of
her
eyebrows
and
the
dazzling
whiteness
of
a
skin
devoid
of
even
the
faintest
tinge
of
color
tiny
blue
veins
alone
broke
the
uniformity
of
its
pure
white
tones
when
the
marquis
turned
to
his
friend
as
if
to
share
with
him
his
amazement
at
the
sight
of
this
singular
creature
he
found
him
stretched
on
the
ground
as
if
dead
d
albon
fired
his
gun
in
the
air
to
summon
assistance
crying
out
help
help
and
then
endeavored
to
revive
the
colonel
at
the
sound
of
the
shot
the
unknown
woman
who
had
hitherto
stood
motionless
fled
away
with
the
rapidity
of
an
arrow
uttering
cries
of
fear
like
a
wounded
animal
and
running
hither
and
thither
about
the
meadow
with
every
sign
of
the
greatest
terror
monsieur
d
albon
hearing
the
rumbling
of
a
carriage
on
the
to
waved
his
handkerchief
and
shouted
to
its
occupants
for
assistance
the
carriage
was
immediately
driven
up
to
the
old
monastery
and
the
marquis
recognized
his
neighbors
monsieur
and
madame
de
granville
who
at
once
gave
up
their
carriage
to
the
service
of
the
two
gentlemen
madame
de
granville
had
with
her
by
chance
a
bottle
of
salts
which
revived
the
colonel
for
a
moment
when
he
opened
his
eyes
he
turned
them
to
the
meadow
where
the
unknown
woman
was
still
running
and
uttering
her
distressing
cries
a
smothered
exclamation
escaped
him
which
seemed
to
express
a
sense
of
horror
then
he
closed
his
eyes
again
and
made
a
gesture
as
if
to
implore
his
friend
to
remove
him
from
that
sight
monsieur
and
madame
de
granville
placed
their
carriage
entirely
at
the
disposal
of
the
marquis
assuring
him
courteously
that
they
would
like
to
continue
their
way
on
foot
who
is
that
lady
asked
the
marquis
signing
toward
the
unknown
woman
i
believe
she
comes
from
moulins
replied
monsieur
de
granville
she
is
the
comtesse
de
vandieres
and
they
say
she
is
mad
but
as
she
has
only
been
here
two
months
i
will
not
vouch
for
the
truth
of
these
monsieur
d
albon
thanked
his
friends
and
placing
the
colonel
in
the
carriage
started
with
him
for
cassan
it
is
she
cried
philippe
recovering
his
senses
who
is
she
asked
d
albon
stephanie
ah
dead
and
living
living
and
mad
i
fancied
i
was
the
prudent
marquis
appreciating
the
gravity
of
the
crisis
through
which
his
friend
was
passing
was
careful
not
to
question
or
excite
him
he
was
only
anxious
to
reach
the
chateau
for
the
change
which
had
taken
place
in
the
colonel
s
features
in
fact
in
his
whole
person
made
him
fear
for
his
friend
s
reason
as
soon
therefore
as
the
carriage
had
reached
the
main
street
of
he
dispatched
the
footman
to
the
village
doctor
so
that
the
colonel
was
no
sooner
fairly
in
his
bed
at
the
chateau
than
the
physician
was
beside
him
if
monsieur
had
not
been
many
hours
without
food
the
shock
would
have
killed
him
said
the
doctor
after
naming
the
first
precautions
the
doctor
left
the
room
to
prepare
himself
a
calming
potion
the
next
day
monsieur
de
sucy
was
better
but
the
doctor
still
watched
him
carefully
i
will
admit
to
you
monsieur
le
marquis
he
said
that
i
have
feared
some
affection
of
the
brain
monsieur
de
sucy
has
received
a
violent
shock
his
passions
are
strong
but
in
him
the
first
blow
decides
all
he
may
be
entirely
out
of
the
doctor
was
not
mistaken
and
the
following
day
he
allowed
the
marquis
to
see
his
friend
my
dear
d
albon
said
philippe
pressing
his
hand
i
am
going
to
ask
a
kindness
of
you
go
to
the
and
find
out
all
you
can
of
the
lady
we
saw
there
and
return
to
me
as
quickly
as
you
can
i
shall
count
the
monsieur
d
albon
mounted
his
horse
at
once
and
galloped
to
the
old
abbey
when
he
arrived
there
he
saw
before
the
iron
gate
a
tall
spare
man
with
a
very
kindly
face
who
answered
in
the
affirmative
when
asked
if
he
lived
there
monsieur
d
albon
then
informed
him
of
the
reasons
for
his
visit
what
monsieur
said
the
other
was
it
you
who
fired
that
fatal
shot
you
very
nearly
killed
my
poor
but
monsieur
i
fired
in
the
you
would
have
done
the
countess
less
harm
had
you
fired
at
then
we
must
not
reproach
each
other
monsieur
for
the
sight
of
the
countess
has
almost
killed
my
friend
monsieur
de
heavens
can
you
mean
baron
philippe
de
sucy
cried
the
doctor
clasping
his
hands
did
he
go
to
russia
was
he
at
the
passage
of
the
beresina
yes
replied
d
albon
he
was
captured
by
the
cossacks
and
kept
for
five
years
in
siberia
he
recovered
his
liberty
a
few
months
come
in
monsieur
said
the
master
of
the
house
leading
the
marquis
into
a
room
on
the
lower
floor
where
everything
bore
the
marks
of
capricious
destruction
the
silken
curtains
beside
the
windows
were
torn
while
those
of
muslin
remained
intact
you
see
said
the
tall
old
man
as
they
entered
the
ravages
committed
by
that
dear
creature
to
whom
i
devote
myself
she
is
my
niece
in
spite
of
the
impotence
of
my
art
i
hope
some
day
to
restore
her
reason
by
attempting
a
method
which
can
only
be
employed
unfortunately
by
very
rich
then
like
all
persons
living
in
solitude
who
are
afflicted
with
an
ever
present
and
ever
renewed
grief
he
related
to
the
marquis
at
length
the
following
narrative
which
is
here
condensed
and
relieved
of
the
many
digressions
made
by
both
the
narrator
and
the
listener
chapter
ii
the
passage
of
the
beresina
marechal
victor
when
he
started
about
nine
at
night
from
the
heights
of
studzianka
which
he
had
defended
as
the
of
the
retreating
army
during
the
whole
day
of
november
left
a
thousand
men
behind
him
with
orders
to
protect
to
the
last
possible
moment
whichever
of
the
two
bridges
across
the
beresina
might
still
exist
this
had
devoted
itself
to
the
task
of
saving
a
frightful
multitude
of
stragglers
overcome
by
the
cold
who
obstinately
refused
to
leave
the
bivouacs
of
the
army
the
heroism
of
this
generous
troop
proved
useless
the
stragglers
who
flocked
in
masses
to
the
banks
of
the
beresina
found
there
unhappily
an
immense
number
of
carriages
caissons
and
articles
of
all
kinds
which
the
army
had
been
forced
to
abandon
when
effecting
its
passage
of
the
river
on
the
and
of
november
heirs
to
such
riches
the
unfortunate
men
stupid
with
cold
took
up
their
abode
in
the
deserted
bivouacs
broke
up
the
material
which
they
found
there
to
build
themselves
cabins
made
fuel
of
everything
that
came
to
hand
cut
up
the
frozen
carcasses
of
the
horses
for
food
tore
the
cloth
and
the
curtains
from
the
carriages
for
coverlets
and
went
to
sleep
instead
of
continuing
their
way
and
crossing
quietly
during
the
night
that
cruel
beresina
which
an
incredible
fatality
had
already
made
so
destructive
to
the
army
the
apathy
of
these
poor
soldiers
can
only
be
conceived
by
those
who
remember
to
have
crossed
vast
deserts
of
snow
without
other
perspective
than
a
snow
horizon
without
other
drink
than
snow
without
other
bed
than
snow
without
other
food
than
snow
or
a
few
frozen
a
few
handfuls
of
flour
or
a
little
horseflesh
dying
of
hunger
thirst
fatigue
and
want
of
sleep
these
unfortunates
reached
a
shore
where
they
saw
before
them
wood
provisions
innumerable
camp
equipages
and
carriages
in
short
a
whole
town
at
their
service
the
village
of
studzianka
had
been
wholly
taken
to
pieces
and
conveyed
from
the
heights
on
which
it
stood
to
the
plain
however
forlorn
and
dangerous
that
refuge
might
be
its
miseries
and
its
perils
only
courted
men
who
had
lately
seen
nothing
before
them
but
the
awful
deserts
of
russia
it
was
in
fact
a
vast
asylum
which
had
an
existence
of
hours
only
utter
lassitude
and
the
sense
of
unexpected
comfort
made
that
mass
of
men
inaccessible
to
every
thought
but
that
of
rest
though
the
artillery
of
the
left
wing
of
the
russians
kept
up
a
steady
fire
on
this
mass
visible
like
a
stain
now
black
now
flaming
in
the
midst
of
the
trackless
snow
this
shot
and
shell
seemed
to
the
torpid
creatures
only
one
inconvenience
the
more
it
was
like
a
thunderstorm
despised
by
all
because
the
lightning
strikes
so
few
the
balls
struck
only
here
and
there
the
dying
the
sick
the
dead
sometimes
stragglers
arrived
in
groups
continually
but
once
here
those
perambulating
corpses
separated
each
begged
for
himself
a
place
near
a
fire
repulsed
repeatedly
they
met
again
to
obtain
by
force
the
hospitality
already
refused
to
them
deaf
to
the
voice
of
some
of
their
officers
who
warned
them
of
probable
destruction
on
the
morrow
they
spent
the
amount
of
courage
necessary
to
cross
the
river
in
building
that
asylum
of
a
night
in
making
one
meal
that
they
themselves
doomed
to
be
their
last
the
death
that
awaited
them
they
considered
no
evil
provided
they
could
have
that
one
night
s
sleep
they
thought
nothing
evil
but
hunger
thirst
and
cold
when
there
was
no
more
wood
or
food
or
fire
horrible
struggles
took
place
between
and
the
rich
who
possessed
a
shelter
the
weakest
succumbed
at
last
there
came
a
moment
when
a
number
pursued
by
the
russians
found
only
snow
on
which
to
bivouac
and
these
lay
down
to
rise
no
more
insensibly
this
mass
of
almost
annihilated
beings
became
so
compact
so
deaf
so
torpid
so
happy
perhaps
that
marechal
victor
who
had
been
their
heroic
defender
by
holding
twenty
thousand
russians
under
wittgenstein
at
bay
was
forced
to
open
a
passage
by
main
force
through
this
forest
of
men
in
order
to
cross
the
beresina
with
five
thousand
gallant
fellows
whom
he
was
taking
to
the
emperor
the
unfortunate
malingerers
allowed
themselves
to
be
crushed
rather
than
stir
they
perished
in
silence
smiling
at
their
extinguished
fires
without
a
thought
of
france
it
was
not
until
ten
o
clock
that
night
that
marechal
victor
reached
the
bank
of
the
river
before
crossing
the
bridge
which
led
to
zembin
he
confided
the
fate
of
his
own
now
left
in
studzianka
to
eble
the
savior
of
all
those
who
survived
the
calamities
of
the
beresina
it
was
towards
midnight
when
this
great
general
followed
by
one
brave
officer
left
the
cabin
he
occupied
near
the
bridge
and
studied
the
spectacle
of
that
improvised
camp
placed
between
the
bank
of
the
river
and
studzianka
the
russian
cannon
had
ceased
to
thunder
innumerable
fires
which
amid
that
trackless
waste
of
snow
burned
pale
and
scarcely
sent
out
any
gleams
illumined
here
and
there
by
sudden
flashes
forms
and
faces
that
were
barely
human
thirty
thousand
poor
wretches
belonging
to
all
nations
from
whom
napoleon
had
recruited
his
russian
army
were
trifling
away
their
lives
with
brutish
indifference
let
us
save
them
said
general
eble
to
the
officer
who
accompanied
him
morning
the
russians
will
be
masters
of
studzianka
we
must
burn
the
bridge
the
moment
they
appear
therefore
my
friend
take
your
courage
in
your
hand
go
to
the
heights
tell
general
fournier
he
has
barely
time
to
evacuate
his
position
force
a
way
through
this
crowd
and
cross
the
bridge
when
you
have
seen
him
in
motion
follow
him
find
men
you
can
trust
and
the
moment
fournier
had
crossed
the
bridge
burn
without
pity
huts
equipages
caissons
carriages
everything
drive
that
mass
of
men
to
the
bridge
compel
all
that
has
two
legs
to
get
to
the
other
side
of
the
river
the
burning
of
everything
everything
is
now
our
last
resource
if
berthier
had
let
me
destroy
those
damned
camp
equipages
this
river
would
swallow
only
my
poor
pontoniers
those
fifty
heroes
who
will
save
the
army
but
who
themselves
will
be
the
general
laid
his
hand
on
his
forehead
and
was
silent
he
felt
that
poland
would
be
his
grave
and
that
no
voice
would
rise
to
do
justice
to
those
noble
men
who
stood
in
the
water
the
icy
water
of
beresina
to
destroy
the
buttresses
of
the
bridges
one
alone
of
those
heroes
still
lives
or
to
speak
more
correctly
suffers
in
a
village
totally
ignored
the
started
hardly
had
this
generous
officer
gone
a
hundred
yards
towards
studzianka
than
general
eble
wakened
a
number
of
his
weary
pontoniers
and
began
the
work
the
charitable
work
of
burning
the
bivouacs
set
up
about
the
bridge
and
forcing
the
sleepers
thus
dislodged
to
cross
the
river
meanwhile
the
young
reached
not
without
difficulty
the
only
wooden
house
still
left
standing
in
studzianka
this
barrack
seems
pretty
full
comrade
he
said
to
a
man
whom
he
saw
by
the
doorway
if
you
can
get
in
you
ll
be
a
clever
trooper
replied
the
officer
without
turning
his
head
or
ceasing
to
slice
off
with
his
sabre
the
bark
of
the
logs
of
which
the
house
was
built
is
that
you
philippe
said
the
recognizing
a
friend
by
the
tones
of
his
voice
yes
ha
ha
is
it
you
old
fellow
replied
monsieur
de
sucy
looking
at
the
who
like
himself
was
only
years
of
age
i
thought
you
were
the
other
side
of
that
cursed
river
what
are
you
here
for
have
you
brought
cakes
and
wine
for
our
dessert
you
ll
be
welcome
and
he
went
on
slicing
off
the
bark
which
he
gave
as
a
sort
of
provender
to
his
horse
i
am
looking
for
your
commander
to
tell
him
from
general
eble
to
make
for
zembin
you
ll
have
barely
enough
time
to
get
through
that
crowd
of
men
below
i
am
going
presently
to
set
fire
to
their
camp
and
force
them
to
you
warm
me
up
almost
that
news
makes
me
perspire
i
have
two
friends
i
must
save
ah
without
those
two
to
cling
to
me
i
should
be
dead
already
it
is
for
them
that
i
feed
my
horse
and
don
t
eat
myself
have
you
any
food
a
mere
crust
it
is
thirty
hours
since
anything
has
gone
into
my
stomach
and
yet
i
have
fought
like
a
madman
just
to
keep
a
little
warmth
and
courage
in
poor
philippe
i
have
nothing
nothing
but
where
s
your
general
in
this
house
no
don
t
go
there
the
place
is
full
of
wounded
go
up
the
street
you
ll
find
on
your
left
a
sort
of
the
general
is
there
old
fellow
if
we
ever
dance
a
trenis
on
a
paris
floor
he
did
not
end
his
sentence
the
north
wind
blew
at
that
moment
with
such
ferocity
that
the
hurried
on
to
escape
being
frozen
and
the
lips
of
major
de
sucy
stiffened
silence
reigned
broken
only
by
the
moans
which
came
from
the
house
and
the
dull
sound
made
by
the
major
s
horse
as
it
chewed
in
a
fury
of
hunger
the
icy
bark
of
the
trees
with
which
the
house
was
built
monsieur
de
sucy
replaced
his
sabre
in
its
scabbard
took
the
bridle
of
the
precious
horse
he
had
hitherto
been
able
to
preserve
and
led
it
in
spite
of
the
animal
s
resistance
from
the
wretched
fodder
it
appeared
to
think
excellent
we
ll
start
bichette
we
ll
start
there
s
none
but
you
my
beauty
who
can
save
stephanie
ha
by
and
bye
you
and
i
may
be
able
to
rest
and
die
he
added
philippe
wrapped
in
a
fur
pelisse
to
which
he
owed
his
preservation
and
his
energy
began
to
run
striking
his
feet
hard
upon
the
frozen
snow
to
keep
them
warm
scarcely
had
he
gone
a
few
hundred
yards
from
the
village
than
he
saw
a
blaze
in
the
direction
of
the
place
where
since
morning
he
had
left
his
carriage
in
charge
of
his
former
orderly
an
old
soldier
horrible
anxiety
laid
hold
of
him
like
all
others
who
were
controlled
during
this
fatal
retreat
by
some
powerful
sentiment
he
found
a
strength
to
save
his
friends
which
he
could
not
have
put
forth
to
save
himself
presently
he
reached
a
slight
declivity
at
the
foot
of
which
in
a
spot
sheltered
from
the
enemy
s
balls
he
had
stationed
the
carriage
containing
a
young
woman
the
companion
of
his
childhood
the
being
most
dear
to
him
on
earth
at
a
few
steps
distant
from
the
vehicle
he
now
found
a
company
of
some
thirty
stragglers
collected
around
an
immense
fire
which
they
were
feeding
with
planks
caisson
covers
wheels
and
broken
carriages
these
soldiers
were
no
doubt
the
last
comers
of
that
crowd
who
from
the
base
of
the
hill
of
studzianka
to
the
fatal
river
formed
an
ocean
of
heads
intermingled
with
fires
and
huts
a
living
sea
swayed
by
motions
that
were
almost
imperceptible
and
giving
forth
a
murmuring
sound
that
rose
at
times
to
frightful
outbursts
driven
by
famine
and
despair
these
poor
wretches
must
have
rifled
the
carriage
before
de
sucy
reached
it
the
old
general
and
his
young
wife
whom
he
had
left
lying
in
piles
of
clothes
and
wrapped
in
mantles
and
pelisses
were
now
on
the
snow
crouching
before
the
fire
one
door
of
the
carriage
was
already
torn
off
no
sooner
did
the
men
about
the
fire
hear
the
tread
of
the
major
s
horse
than
a
hoarse
cry
the
cry
of
famine
arose
a
horse
a
horse
those
voices
formed
but
one
voice
back
back
look
out
for
yourself
cried
two
or
three
soldiers
aiming
at
the
mare
philippe
threw
himself
before
his
animal
crying
out
you
villains
i
ll
throw
you
into
your
own
fire
there
are
plenty
of
dead
horses
up
there
go
and
fetch
isn
t
he
a
joker
that
officer
one
two
get
out
of
the
way
cried
a
colossal
grenadier
no
you
won
t
hey
well
as
you
please
a
woman
s
cry
rose
higher
than
the
report
of
the
musket
philippe
fortunately
was
not
touched
but
bichette
mortally
wounded
was
struggling
in
the
throes
of
death
three
men
darted
forward
and
dispatched
her
with
their
bayonets
cannibals
cried
philippe
let
me
at
any
rate
take
the
and
my
pistols
yes
replied
the
grenadier
but
as
for
that
no
here
s
a
poor
fellow
afoot
with
nothing
in
his
stomach
for
two
days
and
shivering
in
his
rags
it
is
our
philippe
kept
silence
as
he
looked
at
the
man
whose
boots
were
worn
out
his
trousers
torn
in
a
dozen
places
while
nothing
but
a
ragged
covered
with
ice
was
on
his
head
he
hastened
however
to
take
his
pistols
five
men
dragged
the
mare
to
the
fire
and
cut
her
up
with
the
dexterity
of
a
parisian
butcher
the
pieces
were
instantly
seized
and
flung
upon
the
embers
the
major
went
up
to
the
young
woman
who
had
uttered
a
cry
on
recognizing
him
he
found
her
motionless
seated
on
a
cushion
beside
the
fire
she
looked
at
him
silently
without
smiling
philippe
then
saw
the
soldier
to
whom
he
had
confided
the
carriage
the
man
was
wounded
overcome
by
numbers
he
had
been
forced
to
yield
to
the
malingerers
who
attacked
him
and
like
the
dog
who
defended
to
the
last
possible
moment
his
master
s
dinner
he
had
taken
his
share
of
the
booty
and
was
now
sitting
beside
the
fire
wrapped
in
a
white
sheet
by
way
of
cloak
and
turning
carefully
on
the
embers
a
slice
of
the
mare
philippe
saw
upon
his
face
the
joy
these
preparations
gave
him
the
comte
de
vandieres
who
for
the
last
few
days
had
fallen
into
a
state
of
second
childhood
was
seated
on
a
cushion
beside
his
wife
looking
fixedly
at
the
fire
which
was
beginning
to
thaw
his
torpid
limbs
he
had
shown
no
emotion
of
any
kind
either
at
philippe
s
danger
or
at
the
fight
which
ended
in
the
pillage
of
the
carriage
and
their
expulsion
from
it
at
first
de
sucy
took
the
hand
of
the
young
countess
as
if
to
show
her
his
affection
and
the
grief
he
felt
at
seeing
her
reduced
to
such
utter
misery
then
he
grew
silent
seated
beside
her
on
a
heap
of
snow
which
was
turning
into
a
rivulet
as
it
melted
he
yielded
himself
up
to
the
happiness
of
being
warm
forgetting
their
peril
forgetting
all
things
his
face
assumed
in
spite
of
himself
an
expression
of
almost
stupid
joy
and
he
waited
with
impatience
until
the
fragment
of
the
mare
given
to
his
orderly
was
cooked
the
smell
of
the
roasting
flesh
increased
his
hunger
and
his
hunger
silenced
his
heart
his
courage
and
his
love
he
looked
without
anger
at
the
results
of
the
pillage
of
his
carriage
all
the
men
seated
around
the
fire
had
shared
his
blankets
cushions
pelisses
robes
also
the
clothing
of
the
comte
and
comtesse
de
vandieres
and
his
own
philippe
looked
about
him
to
see
if
there
was
anything
left
in
or
near
the
vehicle
that
was
worth
saving
by
the
light
of
the
flames
he
saw
gold
and
diamonds
and
plate
scattered
everywhere
no
one
having
thought
it
worth
his
while
to
take
any
each
of
the
individuals
collected
by
chance
around
this
fire
maintained
a
silence
that
was
almost
horrible
and
did
nothing
but
what
he
judged
necessary
for
his
own
welfare
their
misery
was
even
grotesque
faces
discolored
by
cold
were
covered
with
a
layer
of
mud
on
which
tears
had
made
a
furrow
from
the
eyes
to
the
beard
showing
the
thickness
of
that
miry
mask
the
filth
of
their
long
beards
made
these
men
still
more
repulsive
some
were
wrapped
in
the
countess
s
shawls
others
wore
the
trappings
of
horses
and
muddy
saddlecloths
or
masses
of
rags
from
which
the
hung
some
had
a
boot
on
one
leg
and
a
shoe
on
the
other
in
fact
there
were
none
whose
costume
did
not
present
some
laughable
singularity
but
in
presence
of
such
amusing
sights
the
men
themselves
were
grave
and
gloomy
the
silence
was
broken
only
by
the
snapping
of
the
wood
the
crackling
of
the
flames
the
distant
murmur
of
the
camps
and
the
blows
of
the
sabre
given
to
what
remained
of
bichette
in
search
of
her
tenderest
morsels
a
few
miserable
creatures
perhaps
more
weary
than
the
rest
were
sleeping
when
one
of
their
number
rolled
into
the
fire
no
one
attempted
to
help
him
out
these
stern
logicians
argued
that
if
he
were
not
dead
his
burns
would
warn
him
to
find
a
safer
place
if
the
poor
wretch
waked
in
the
flames
and
perished
no
one
cared
two
or
three
soldiers
looked
at
each
other
to
justify
their
own
indifference
by
that
of
others
twice
this
scene
had
taken
place
before
the
eyes
of
the
countess
who
said
nothing
when
the
various
pieces
of
bichette
placed
here
and
there
upon
the
embers
were
sufficiently
broiled
each
man
satisfied
his
hunger
with
the
gluttony
that
disgusts
us
when
we
see
it
in
animals
this
is
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
thirty
infantrymen
on
one
horse
cried
the
grenadier
who
had
shot
the
mare
it
was
the
only
jest
made
that
night
which
proved
the
national
character
soon
the
great
number
of
these
poor
soldiers
wrapped
themselves
in
what
they
could
find
and
lay
down
on
planks
or
whatever
would
keep
them
from
contact
with
the
snow
and
slept
heedless
of
the
morrow
when
the
major
was
warm
and
his
hunger
appeased
an
invincible
desire
to
sleep
weighed
down
his
eyelids
during
the
short
moment
of
his
struggle
against
that
desire
he
looked
at
the
young
woman
who
had
turned
her
face
to
the
fire
and
was
now
asleep
leaving
her
closed
eyes
and
a
portion
of
her
forehead
exposed
to
sight
she
was
wrapped
in
a
furred
pelisse
and
a
heavy
dragoon
s
cloak
her
head
rested
on
a
pillow
stained
with
blood
an
astrakhan
hood
kept
in
place
by
a
handkerchief
knotted
round
her
neck
preserved
her
face
from
the
cold
as
much
as
possible
her
feet
were
wrapped
in
the
cloak
thus
rolled
into
a
bundle
as
it
were
she
looked
like
nothing
at
all
was
she
the
last
of
the
vivandieres
was
she
a
charming
woman
the
glory
of
a
lover
the
queen
of
parisian
salons
alas
even
the
eye
of
her
most
devoted
friend
could
trace
no
sign
of
anything
feminine
in
that
mass
of
rags
and
tatters
love
had
succumbed
to
cold
in
the
heart
of
a
woman
through
the
thick
veils
of
irresistible
sleep
the
major
soon
saw
the
husband
and
wife
as
mere
points
or
formless
objects
the
flames
of
the
fire
those
outstretched
figures
the
relentless
cold
waiting
not
three
feet
distant
from
that
fugitive
heat
became
all
a
dream
one
importunate
thought
terrified
philippe
if
i
sleep
we
shall
all
die
i
will
not
sleep
he
said
to
himself
and
yet
he
slept
a
terrible
clamor
and
an
explosion
awoke
him
an
hour
later
the
sense
of
his
duty
the
peril
of
his
friend
fell
suddenly
on
his
heart
he
uttered
a
cry
that
was
like
a
roar
he
and
his
orderly
were
alone
afoot
a
sea
of
fire
lay
before
them
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
licking
up
the
cabins
and
the
bivouacs
cries
of
despair
howls
and
imprecations
reached
their
ears
they
saw
against
the
flames
thousands
of
human
beings
with
agonized
or
furious
faces
in
the
midst
of
that
hell
a
column
of
soldiers
was
forcing
its
way
to
the
bridge
between
two
hedges
of
dead
bodies
it
is
the
retreat
of
the
cried
the
major
all
hope
is
gone
i
have
saved
your
carriage
philippe
said
a
friendly
voice
turning
round
de
sucy
recognized
the
young
in
the
flaring
of
the
flames
ah
all
is
lost
replied
the
major
they
have
eaten
my
horse
and
how
can
i
make
this
stupid
general
and
his
wife
walk
take
a
brand
from
the
fire
and
threaten
threaten
the
countess
said
the
i
have
scarcely
time
to
get
across
that
fatal
river
and
i
must
i
have
a
mother
in
france
what
a
night
these
poor
wretches
prefer
to
lie
here
in
the
snow
half
will
allow
themselves
to
perish
in
those
flames
rather
than
rise
and
move
on
it
is
four
o
clock
philippe
in
two
hours
the
russians
will
begin
to
move
i
assure
you
you
will
again
see
the
beresina
choked
with
corpses
philippe
think
of
yourself
you
have
no
horses
you
can
not
carry
the
countess
in
your
arms
come
come
with
me
he
said
urgently
pulling
de
sucy
by
the
arm
my
friend
abandon
stephanie
de
sucy
seized
the
countess
made
her
stand
upright
shook
her
with
the
roughness
of
a
despairing
man
and
compelled
her
to
wake
up
she
looked
at
him
with
fixed
dead
eyes
you
must
walk
stephanie
or
we
shall
all
die
for
all
answer
the
countess
tried
to
drop
again
upon
the
snow
and
sleep
the
seized
a
brand
from
the
fire
and
waved
it
in
her
face
we
will
save
her
in
spite
of
herself
cried
philippe
lifting
the
countess
and
placing
her
in
the
carriage
he
returned
to
implore
the
help
of
his
friend
together
they
lifted
the
old
general
without
knowing
whether
he
were
dead
or
alive
and
put
him
beside
his
wife
the
major
then
rolled
over
the
men
who
were
sleeping
on
his
blankets
which
he
tossed
into
the
carriage
together
with
some
roasted
fragments
of
his
mare
what
do
you
mean
to
do
asked
the
drag
you
are
true
said
philippe
crossing
his
arms
in
despair
suddenly
he
was
seized
by
a
last
despairing
thought
to
you
he
said
grasping
the
sound
arm
of
his
orderly
i
confide
her
for
one
hour
remember
that
you
must
die
sooner
than
let
any
one
approach
the
major
then
snatched
up
the
countess
s
diamonds
held
them
in
one
hand
drew
his
sabre
with
the
other
and
began
to
strike
with
the
flat
of
its
blade
such
of
the
sleepers
as
he
thought
the
most
intrepid
he
succeeded
in
awaking
the
colossal
grenadier
and
two
other
men
whose
rank
it
was
impossible
to
tell
we
are
done
for
he
said
i
know
it
said
the
grenadier
but
i
don
t
well
death
for
death
wouldn
t
you
rather
sell
your
life
for
a
pretty
woman
and
take
your
chances
of
seeing
france
i
d
rather
sleep
said
a
man
rolling
over
on
the
snow
and
if
you
trouble
me
again
i
ll
stick
my
bayonet
into
your
what
is
the
business
my
colonel
said
the
grenadier
that
man
is
drunk
he
s
a
parisian
he
likes
his
that
is
yours
my
brave
grenadier
cried
the
major
offering
him
a
string
of
diamonds
if
you
will
follow
me
and
fight
like
a
madman
the
russians
are
ten
minutes
march
from
here
they
have
horses
we
are
going
up
to
their
first
battery
for
a
but
the
sentinels
one
of
us
three
he
interrupted
himself
and
turned
to
the
you
will
come
hippolyte
won
t
you
hippolyte
nodded
one
of
us
continued
the
major
will
take
care
of
the
sentinel
besides
perhaps
they
are
asleep
too
those
cursed
forward
major
you
re
a
brave
one
but
you
ll
give
me
a
lift
on
your
carriage
said
the
grenadier
yes
if
you
don
t
leave
your
skin
up
there
if
i
fall
hippolyte
and
you
grenadier
promise
me
to
do
your
utmost
to
save
the
agreed
cried
the
grenadier
they
started
for
the
russian
lines
toward
one
of
the
batteries
which
had
so
decimated
the
hapless
wretches
lying
on
the
banks
of
the
river
a
few
moments
later
the
gallop
of
two
horses
echoed
over
the
snow
and
the
wakened
artillery
men
poured
out
a
volley
which
ranged
above
the
heads
of
the
sleeping
men
the
pace
of
the
horses
was
so
fleet
that
their
steps
resounded
like
the
blows
of
a
blacksmith
on
his
anvil
the
generous
was
killed
the
athletic
grenadier
was
safe
and
sound
philippe
in
defending
hippolyte
had
received
a
bayonet
in
his
shoulder
but
he
clung
to
his
horse
s
mane
and
clasped
him
so
tightly
with
his
knees
that
the
animal
was
held
as
in
a
vice
god
be
praised
cried
the
major
finding
his
orderly
untouched
and
the
carriage
in
its
place
if
you
are
just
my
officer
you
will
get
me
the
cross
for
this
said
the
man
we
ve
played
a
fine
game
of
guns
and
sabres
here
i
can
tell
we
have
done
nothing
yet
harness
the
horses
take
these
they
are
not
long
grenadier
turn
over
those
sleepers
and
take
their
shawls
and
linen
to
eke
tiens
that
s
one
dead
said
the
grenadier
stripping
the
first
man
he
came
to
bless
me
what
a
joke
they
are
all
dead
all
yes
all
seems
as
if
must
be
indigestible
if
eaten
with
the
words
made
philippe
tremble
the
cold
was
increasing
my
god
to
lose
the
woman
i
have
saved
a
dozen
times
the
major
shook
the
countess
stephanie
stephanie
the
young
woman
opened
her
eyes
madame
we
are
saved
she
repeated
sinking
down
again
the
horses
were
harnessed
as
best
they
could
the
major
holding
his
sabre
in
his
well
hand
with
his
pistols
in
his
belt
gathered
up
the
reins
with
the
other
hand
and
mounted
one
horse
while
the
grenadier
mounted
the
other
the
orderly
whose
feet
were
frozen
was
thrown
inside
the
carriage
across
the
general
and
the
countess
excited
by
pricks
from
a
sabre
the
horses
drew
the
carriage
rapidly
with
a
sort
of
fury
to
the
plain
where
innumerable
obstacles
awaited
it
it
was
impossible
to
force
a
way
without
danger
of
crushing
the
sleeping
men
women
and
even
children
who
refused
to
move
when
the
grenadier
awoke
them
in
vain
did
monsieur
de
sucy
endeavor
to
find
the
swathe
cut
by
the
through
the
mass
of
human
beings
it
was
already
obliterated
like
the
wake
of
a
vessel
through
the
sea
they
could
only
creep
along
being
often
stopped
by
soldiers
who
threatened
to
kill
their
horses
do
you
want
to
reach
the
bridge
said
the
grenadier
at
the
cost
of
my
life
at
the
cost
of
the
whole
world
then
forward
march
you
can
t
make
omelets
without
breaking
and
the
grenadier
of
the
guard
urged
the
horses
over
men
and
bivouacs
with
bloody
wheels
and
a
double
line
of
corpses
on
either
side
of
them
we
must
do
him
the
justice
to
say
that
he
never
spared
his
breath
in
shouting
in
stentorian
tones
look
out
there
carrion
poor
wretches
cried
the
major
pooh
that
or
the
cold
that
or
the
cannon
said
the
grenadier
prodding
the
horses
and
urging
them
on
a
catastrophe
which
might
well
have
happened
to
them
much
sooner
put
a
stop
to
their
advance
the
carriage
was
overturned
i
expected
it
cried
the
imperturbable
grenadier
ho
ho
your
man
is
poor
laurent
said
the
major
laurent
was
he
in
the
chasseurs
then
he
was
my
cousin
oh
well
this
dog
s
life
isn
t
happy
enough
to
waste
any
joy
in
grieving
for
the
carriage
could
not
be
raised
the
horses
were
taken
out
with
serious
and
as
it
proved
irreparable
loss
of
time
the
shock
of
the
overturn
was
so
violent
that
the
young
countess
roused
from
her
lethargy
threw
off
her
coverings
and
rose
philippe
where
are
we
she
cried
in
a
gentle
voice
looking
about
her
only
five
hundred
feet
from
the
bridge
we
are
now
going
to
cross
the
beresina
stephanie
and
once
across
i
will
not
torment
you
any
more
you
shall
sleep
we
shall
be
in
safety
and
can
reach
wilna
god
grant
that
she
may
never
know
what
her
life
has
cost
he
thought
philippe
you
are
wounded
that
is
too
late
the
fatal
hour
had
come
the
russian
cannon
sounded
the
reveille
masters
of
studzianka
they
could
sweep
the
plain
and
by
daylight
the
major
could
see
two
of
their
columns
moving
and
forming
on
the
heights
a
cry
of
alarm
arose
from
the
multitude
who
started
to
their
feet
in
an
instant
every
man
now
understood
his
danger
instinctively
and
the
whole
mass
rushed
to
gain
the
bridge
with
the
motion
of
a
wave
the
russians
came
down
with
the
rapidity
of
a
conflagration
men
women
children
horses
all
rushed
tumultuously
to
the
bridge
fortunately
the
major
who
was
carrying
the
countess
was
still
some
distance
from
it
general
eble
had
just
set
fire
to
the
supports
on
the
other
bank
in
spite
of
the
warnings
shouted
to
those
who
were
rushing
upon
the
bridge
not
a
soul
went
back
not
only
did
the
bridge
go
down
crowded
with
human
beings
but
the
impetuosity
of
that
flood
of
men
toward
the
fatal
bank
was
so
furious
that
a
mass
of
humanity
poured
itself
violently
into
the
river
like
an
avalanche
not
a
cry
was
heard
the
only
sound
was
like
the
dropping
of
monstrous
stones
into
the
water
then
the
beresina
was
a
mass
of
floating
corpses
the
retrograde
movement
of
those
who
now
fell
back
into
the
plain
to
escape
the
death
before
them
was
so
violent
and
their
concussion
against
those
who
were
advancing
from
the
rear
so
terrible
that
numbers
were
smothered
or
trampled
to
death
the
comte
and
comtesse
de
vandieres
owed
their
lives
to
their
carriage
behind
which
philippe
forced
them
using
it
as
a
breastwork
as
for
the
major
and
the
grenadier
they
found
their
safety
in
their
strength
they
killed
to
escape
being
killed
this
hurricane
of
human
beings
the
flux
and
reflux
of
living
bodies
had
the
effect
of
leaving
for
a
few
short
moments
the
whole
bank
of
the
beresina
deserted
the
multitude
were
surging
to
the
plain
if
a
few
men
rushed
to
the
river
it
was
less
in
the
hope
of
reaching
the
other
bank
which
to
them
was
france
than
to
rush
from
the
horrors
of
siberia
despair
proved
an
aegis
to
some
bold
hearts
one
officer
sprang
from
to
and
reached
the
opposite
shore
a
soldier
clambered
miraculously
over
mounds
of
dead
bodies
and
heaps
of
ice
the
multitude
finally
comprehended
that
the
russians
would
not
put
to
death
a
body
of
twenty
thousand
men
without
arms
torpid
stupid
unable
to
defend
themselves
and
each
man
awaited
his
fate
with
horrible
resignation
then
the
major
and
the
grenadier
the
general
and
his
wife
remained
almost
alone
on
the
river
bank
a
few
steps
from
the
spot
where
the
bridge
had
been
they
stood
there
with
dry
eyes
silent
surrounded
by
heaps
of
dead
a
few
sound
soldiers
a
few
officers
to
whom
the
emergency
had
restored
their
natural
energy
were
near
them
this
group
consisted
of
some
fifty
men
in
all
the
major
noticed
at
a
distance
of
some
two
hundred
yards
the
remains
of
another
bridge
intended
for
carriages
and
destroyed
the
day
before
let
us
make
a
raft
he
cried
he
had
hardly
uttered
the
words
before
the
whole
group
rushed
to
the
ruins
and
began
to
pick
up
iron
bolts
and
screws
and
pieces
of
wood
and
ropes
whatever
materials
they
could
find
that
were
suitable
for
the
construction
of
a
raft
a
score
of
soldiers
and
officers
who
were
armed
formed
a
guard
commanded
by
the
major
to
protect
the
workers
against
the
desperate
attacks
which
might
be
expected
from
the
crowd
if
their
scheme
was
discovered
the
instinct
of
freedom
strong
in
all
prisoners
inspiring
them
to
miraculous
acts
can
only
be
compared
with
that
which
now
drove
to
action
these
unfortunate
frenchmen
the
russians
the
russians
are
coming
cried
the
defenders
to
the
workers
and
the
work
went
on
the
raft
increased
in
length
and
breadth
and
depth
generals
soldiers
colonel
all
put
their
shoulders
to
the
wheel
it
was
a
true
image
of
the
building
of
noah
s
ark
the
young
countess
seated
beside
her
husband
watched
the
progress
of
the
work
with
regret
that
she
could
not
help
it
and
yet
she
did
assist
in
making
knots
to
secure
the
cordage
at
last
the
raft
was
finished
forty
men
launched
it
on
the
river
a
dozen
others
holding
the
cords
which
moored
it
to
the
shore
but
no
sooner
had
the
builders
seen
their
handiwork
afloat
than
they
sprang
from
the
bank
with
odious
selfishness
the
major
fearing
the
fury
of
this
first
rush
held
back
the
countess
and
the
general
but
too
late
he
saw
the
whole
raft
covered
men
pressing
together
like
crowds
at
a
theatre
savages
he
cried
it
was
i
who
gave
you
the
idea
of
that
raft
i
have
saved
you
and
you
deny
me
a
a
confused
murmur
answered
him
the
men
at
the
edge
of
the
raft
armed
with
long
sticks
pressed
with
violence
against
the
shore
to
send
off
the
frail
construction
with
sufficient
impetus
to
force
its
way
through
corpses
and
to
the
other
shore
thunder
of
heaven
i
ll
sweep
you
into
the
water
if
you
don
t
take
the
major
and
his
two
companions
cried
the
stalwart
grenadier
who
swung
his
sabre
stopped
the
departure
and
forced
the
men
to
stand
closer
in
spite
of
furious
outcries
i
shall
fall
i
am
falling
push
off
push
off
forward
resounded
on
all
sides
the
major
looked
with
haggard
eyes
at
stephanie
who
lifted
hers
to
heaven
with
a
feeling
of
sublime
resignation
to
die
with
thee
she
said
there
was
something
even
comical
in
the
position
of
the
men
in
possession
of
the
raft
though
they
were
uttering
awful
groans
and
imprecations
they
dared
not
resist
the
grenadier
for
in
truth
they
were
so
closely
packed
together
that
a
push
to
one
man
might
send
half
of
them
overboard
this
danger
was
so
pressing
that
a
cavalry
captain
endeavored
to
get
rid
of
the
grenadier
but
the
latter
seeing
the
hostile
movement
of
the
officer
seized
him
round
the
waist
and
flung
him
into
the
water
crying
out
ha
ha
my
duck
do
you
want
to
drink
well
then
drink
here
are
two
places
he
cried
come
major
toss
me
the
little
woman
and
follow
yourself
leave
that
old
fossil
who
ll
be
dead
by
make
haste
cried
the
voice
of
all
as
one
man
come
major
they
are
grumbling
and
they
have
a
right
to
do
the
comte
de
vandieres
threw
off
his
wrappings
and
showed
himself
in
his
general
s
uniform
let
us
save
the
count
said
philippe
stephanie
pressed
his
hand
and
throwing
herself
on
his
breast
she
clasped
him
tightly
adieu
she
said
they
had
understood
each
other
the
comte
de
vandieres
recovered
sufficient
strength
and
presence
of
mind
to
spring
upon
the
raft
whither
stephanie
followed
him
after
turning
a
last
look
to
philippe
major
will
you
take
my
place
i
don
t
care
a
fig
for
life
cried
the
grenadier
i
ve
neither
wife
nor
child
nor
i
confide
them
to
your
care
said
the
major
pointing
to
the
count
and
his
wife
then
be
easy
i
ll
care
for
them
as
though
they
were
my
very
the
raft
was
now
sent
off
with
so
much
violence
toward
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
that
as
it
touched
ground
the
shock
was
felt
by
all
the
count
who
was
at
the
edge
of
it
lost
his
balance
and
fell
into
the
river
as
he
fell
a
cake
of
sharp
ice
caught
him
and
cut
off
his
head
flinging
it
to
a
great
distance
see
there

cried
the
grenadier

fell
to

and
fatigue
chapter
iii
the
cure
my
poor
niece
became
insane
continued
the
physician
after
a
few
moment
s
silence
ah
monsieur
he
said
seizing
the
marquis
s
hand
life
has
been
awful
indeed
for
that
poor
little
woman
so
young
so
delicate
after
being
by
dreadful
fatality
separated
from
the
grenadier
whose
name
was
fleuriot
she
was
dragged
about
for
two
years
at
the
heels
of
the
army
the
plaything
of
a
crowd
of
wretches
she
was
often
they
tell
me
barefooted
and
scarcely
clothed
for
months
together
she
had
no
care
no
food
but
what
she
could
pick
up
sometimes
kept
in
hospitals
sometimes
driven
away
like
an
animal
god
alone
knows
the
horrors
that
poor
unfortunate
creature
has
survived
she
was
locked
up
in
a
madhouse
in
a
little
town
in
germany
at
the
time
her
relatives
thinking
her
dead
divided
her
property
in
the
grenadier
fleuriot
was
at
an
inn
in
strasburg
where
she
went
after
making
her
escape
from
the
madhouse
several
peasants
told
the
grenadier
that
she
had
lived
for
a
whole
month
in
the
forest
where
they
had
tracked
her
in
vain
trying
to
catch
her
but
she
had
always
escaped
them
i
was
then
staying
a
few
miles
from
strasburg
hearing
much
talk
of
a
wild
woman
caught
in
the
woods
i
felt
a
desire
to
ascertain
the
truth
of
the
ridiculous
stories
which
were
current
about
her
what
were
my
feelings
on
beholding
my
own
niece
fleuriot
told
me
all
he
knew
of
her
dreadful
history
i
took
the
poor
man
with
my
niece
back
to
my
home
in
auvergne
where
unfortunately
i
lost
him
some
months
later
he
had
some
slight
control
over
madame
de
vandieres
he
alone
could
induce
her
to
wear
clothing
adieu
that
word
which
is
her
only
language
she
seldom
uttered
at
that
time
fleuriot
had
endeavored
to
awaken
in
her
a
few
ideas
a
few
memories
of
the
past
but
he
failed
all
that
he
gained
was
to
make
her
say
that
melancholy
word
a
little
oftener
still
the
grenadier
knew
how
to
amuse
her
and
play
with
her
my
hope
was
in
him
but
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
here
he
continued
she
has
found
another
creature
with
whom
she
seems
to
have
some
strange
understanding
it
is
a
poor
idiotic
who
in
spite
of
her
ugliness
and
stupidity
loved
a
man
a
mason
the
mason
was
willing
to
marry
her
as
she
had
some
property
poor
genevieve
was
happy
for
a
year
she
dressed
in
her
best
to
dance
with
her
lover
on
sunday
she
comprehended
love
in
her
heart
and
soul
there
was
room
for
that
one
sentiment
but
the
mason
dallot
reflected
he
found
a
girl
with
all
her
senses
and
more
land
than
genevieve
and
he
deserted
the
poor
creature
since
then
she
has
lost
the
little
intellect
that
love
developed
in
her
she
can
do
nothing
but
watch
the
cows
or
help
at
harvesting
my
niece
and
this
poor
girl
are
friends
apparently
by
some
invisible
chain
of
their
common
destiny
by
the
sentiment
in
each
which
has
caused
their
madness
see
added
stephanie
s
uncle
leading
the
marquis
to
a
window
the
latter
then
saw
the
countess
seated
on
the
ground
between
genevieve
s
legs
the
armed
with
a
huge
horn
comb
was
giving
her
whole
attention
to
the
work
of
disentangling
the
long
black
hair
of
the
poor
countess
who
was
uttering
little
stifled
cries
expressive
of
some
instinctive
sense
of
pleasure
monsieur
d
albon
shuddered
as
he
saw
the
utter
abandonment
of
the
body
the
careless
animal
ease
which
revealed
in
the
hapless
woman
a
total
absence
of
soul
philippe
philippe
he
muttered
the
past
horrors
are
nothing
is
there
no
hope
he
asked
the
old
physician
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
adieu
monsieur
said
the
marquis
pressing
his
hand
my
friend
is
expecting
me
he
will
soon
come
to
then
it
was
really
she
cried
de
sucy
at
d
albon
s
first
words
ah
i
still
doubted
it
he
added
a
few
tears
falling
from
his
eyes
which
were
habitually
stern
yes
it
is
the
comtesse
de
vandieres
replied
the
marquis
the
colonel
rose
abruptly
from
his
bed
and
began
to
dress
philippe
cried
his
friend
are
you
mad
i
am
no
longer
ill
replied
the
colonel
simply
this
news
has
quieted
my
suffering
what
pain
can
i
feel
when
i
think
of
stephanie
i
am
going
to
the
to
see
her
speak
to
her
cure
her
she
is
free
well
happiness
will
smile
upon
us
or
providence
is
not
in
this
world
think
you
that
that
poor
woman
could
hear
my
voice
and
not
recover
reason
she
has
already
seen
you
and
not
recognized
you
said
his
friend
gently
for
he
felt
the
danger
of
philippe
s
excited
hopes
and
tried
to
cast
a
salutary
doubt
upon
them
the
colonel
quivered
then
he
smiled
and
made
a
motion
of
incredulity
no
one
dared
to
oppose
his
wish
and
within
a
very
short
time
he
reached
the
old
priory
where
is
she
he
cried
on
arriving
hush
said
her
uncle
she
is
sleeping
see
here
she
philippe
then
saw
the
poor
insane
creature
lying
on
a
bench
in
the
sun
her
head
was
protected
from
the
heat
by
a
forest
of
hair
which
fell
in
tangled
locks
over
her
face
her
arms
hung
gracefully
to
the
ground
her
body
lay
easily
posed
like
that
of
a
doe
her
feet
were
folded
under
her
without
effort
her
bosom
rose
and
fell
at
regular
intervals
her
skin
her
complexion
had
that
porcelain
whiteness
which
we
admire
so
much
in
the
clear
transparent
faces
of
children
standing
motionless
beside
her
genevieve
held
in
her
hand
a
branch
which
stephanie
had
doubtless
climbed
a
tall
poplar
to
obtain
and
the
poor
idiot
was
gently
waving
it
above
her
sleeping
companion
to
chase
away
the
flies
and
cool
the
atmosphere
the
gazed
at
monsieur
fanjat
and
the
colonel
then
like
an
animal
which
recognizes
its
master
she
turned
her
head
slowly
to
the
countess
and
continued
to
watch
her
without
giving
any
sign
of
surprise
or
intelligence
the
air
was
stifling
the
stone
bench
glittered
in
the
sunlight
the
meadow
exhaled
to
heaven
those
impish
vapors
which
dance
and
dart
above
the
herbage
like
silvery
dust
but
genevieve
seemed
not
to
feel
this
heat
the
colonel
pressed
the
hand
of
the
doctor
violently
in
his
own
tears
rolled
from
his
eyes
along
his
manly
cheeks
and
fell
to
the
earth
at
the
feet
of
his
stephanie
monsieur
said
the
uncle
for
two
years
past
my
heart
is
broken
day
by
day
soon
you
will
be
like
me
you
may
not
always
weep
but
you
will
always
feel
your
the
two
men
understood
each
other
and
again
pressing
each
other
s
hands
they
remained
motionless
contemplating
the
exquisite
calmness
which
sleep
had
cast
upon
that
graceful
creature
from
time
to
time
she
gave
a
sigh
and
that
sigh
which
had
all
the
semblance
of
sensibilities
made
the
unhappy
colonel
tremble
with
hope
alas
said
monsieur
fanjat
do
not
deceive
yourself
monsieur
there
is
no
meaning
in
her
those
who
have
ever
watched
for
hours
with
delight
the
sleep
of
one
who
is
tenderly
beloved
whose
eyes
will
smile
to
them
at
waking
can
understand
the
sweet
yet
terrible
emotion
that
shook
the
colonel
s
soul
to
him
this
sleep
was
an
illusion
the
waking
might
be
death
death
in
its
most
awful
form
suddenly
a
little
goat
jumped
in
three
bounds
to
the
bench
and
smelt
at
stephanie
who
waked
at
the
sound
she
sprang
to
her
feet
but
so
lightly
that
the
movement
did
not
frighten
the
freakish
animal
then
she
caught
sight
of
philippe
and
darted
away
followed
by
her
friend
to
a
hedge
of
elders
there
she
uttered
the
same
little
cry
like
a
frightened
bird
which
the
two
men
had
heard
near
the
other
gate
then
she
climbed
an
acacia
and
nestling
into
its
tufted
top
she
watched
the
stranger
with
the
inquisitive
attention
of
the
forest
birds
adieu
adieu
adieu
she
said
without
the
soul
communicating
one
single
intelligent
inflexion
to
the
word
it
was
uttered
impassively
as
the
bird
sings
his
note
she
does
not
recognize
me
cried
the
colonel
in
despair
stephanie
it
is
philippe
thy
philippe
philippe
and
the
poor
soldier
went
to
the
acacia
but
when
he
was
a
few
steps
from
it
the
countess
looked
at
him
as
if
defying
him
although
a
slight
expression
of
fear
seemed
to
flicker
in
her
eye
then
with
a
single
bound
she
sprang
from
the
acacia
to
a
laburnum
and
thence
to
a
norway
fir
where
she
darted
from
branch
to
branch
with
extraordinary
agility
do
not
pursue
her
said
monsieur
fanjat
to
the
colonel
or
you
will
arouse
an
aversion
which
might
become
insurmountable
i
will
help
you
to
tame
her
and
make
her
come
to
you
let
us
sit
on
this
bench
if
you
pay
no
attention
to
her
she
will
come
of
her
own
accord
to
examine
she
not
to
know
me
to
flee
me
repeated
the
colonel
seating
himself
on
a
bench
with
his
back
to
a
tree
that
shaded
it
and
letting
his
head
fall
upon
his
breast
the
doctor
said
nothing
presently
the
countess
came
gently
down
the
letting
herself
swing
easily
on
the
branches
as
the
wind
swayed
them
at
each
branch
she
stopped
to
examine
the
stranger
but
seeing
him
motionless
she
at
last
sprang
to
the
ground
and
came
slowly
towards
him
across
the
grass
when
she
reached
a
tree
about
ten
feet
distant
against
which
she
leaned
monsieur
fanjat
said
to
the
colonel
in
a
low
voice
take
out
adroitly
from
my
right
hand
pocket
some
lumps
of
sugar
you
will
feel
there
show
them
to
her
and
she
will
come
to
us
i
will
renounce
in
your
favor
my
sole
means
of
giving
her
pleasure
with
sugar
which
she
passionately
loves
you
will
accustom
her
to
approach
you
and
to
know
you
when
she
was
a
woman
said
philippe
sadly
she
had
no
taste
for
sweet
when
the
colonel
showed
her
the
lump
of
sugar
holding
it
between
the
thumb
and
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
she
again
uttered
her
little
wild
cry
and
sprang
toward
him
then
she
stopped
struggling
against
the
instinctive
fear
he
caused
her
she
looked
at
the
sugar
and
turned
away
her
head
alternately
precisely
like
a
dog
whose
master
forbids
him
to
touch
his
food
until
he
has
said
a
letter
of
the
alphabet
which
he
slowly
repeats
at
last
the
animal
desire
triumphed
over
fear
stephanie
darted
to
philippe
cautiously
putting
out
her
little
brown
hand
to
seize
the
prize
touched
the
fingers
of
her
poor
lover
as
she
snatched
the
sugar
and
fled
away
among
the
trees
this
dreadful
scene
overcame
the
colonel
he
burst
into
tears
and
rushed
into
the
house
has
love
less
courage
than
friendship
monsieur
fanjat
said
to
him
i
have
some
hope
monsieur
le
baron
my
poor
niece
was
in
a
far
worse
state
than
that
in
which
you
now
find
how
was
that
possible
cried
philippe
she
went
naked
replied
the
doctor
the
colonel
made
a
gesture
of
horror
and
turned
pale
the
doctor
saw
in
that
sudden
pallor
alarming
symptoms
he
felt
the
colonel
s
pulse
found
him
in
a
violent
fever
and
half
persuaded
half
compelled
him
to
go
to
bed
then
he
gave
him
a
dose
of
opium
to
ensure
a
calm
sleep
eight
days
elapsed
during
which
colonel
de
sucy
struggled
against
mortal
agony
tears
no
longer
came
to
his
eyes
his
soul
often
lacerated
could
not
harden
itself
to
the
sight
of
stephanie
s
insanity
but
he
covenanted
so
to
speak
with
his
cruel
situation
and
found
some
assuaging
of
his
sorrow
he
had
the
courage
to
slowly
tame
the
countess
by
bringing
her
sweetmeats
he
took
such
pains
in
choosing
them
and
he
learned
so
well
how
to
keep
the
little
conquests
he
sought
to
make
upon
her
instincts
that
last
shred
of
her
intellect
that
he
ended
by
making
her
much
tamer
than
she
had
ever
been
every
morning
he
went
into
the
park
and
if
after
searching
for
her
long
he
could
not
discover
on
what
tree
she
was
swaying
nor
the
covert
in
which
she
crouched
to
play
with
a
bird
nor
the
roof
on
which
she
might
have
clambered
he
would
whistle
the
air
of
partant
pour
la
syrie
to
which
some
tender
memory
of
their
love
attached
instantly
stephanie
would
run
to
him
with
the
lightness
of
a
fawn
she
was
now
so
accustomed
to
see
him
that
he
frightened
her
no
longer
soon
she
was
willing
to
sit
upon
his
knee
and
clasp
him
closely
with
her
thin
and
agile
arm
in
that
attitude
so
dear
to
lovers
philippe
would
feed
her
with
sugarplums
then
having
eaten
those
that
he
gave
her
she
would
often
search
his
pockets
with
gestures
that
had
all
the
mechanical
velocity
of
a
monkey
s
motions
when
she
was
very
sure
there
was
nothing
more
she
looked
at
philippe
with
clear
eyes
without
ideas
with
recognition
then
she
would
play
with
him
trying
at
times
to
take
off
his
boots
to
see
his
feet
tearing
his
gloves
putting
on
his
hat
she
would
even
let
him
pass
his
hands
through
her
hair
and
take
her
in
his
arms
she
accepted
but
without
pleasure
his
ardent
kisses
she
would
look
at
him
silently
without
emotion
when
his
tears
flowed
but
she
always
understood
his
partant
pour
la
syrie
when
he
whistled
it
though
he
never
succeeded
in
teaching
her
to
say
her
own
name
stephanie
philippe
was
sustained
in
his
agonizing
enterprise
by
hope
which
never
abandoned
him
when
on
fine
autumn
mornings
he
found
the
countess
sitting
peacefully
on
a
bench
beneath
a
poplar
now
yellowing
the
poor
lover
would
sit
at
her
feet
looking
into
her
eyes
as
long
as
she
would
let
him
hoping
ever
that
the
light
that
was
in
them
would
become
intelligent
sometimes
the
thought
deluded
him
that
he
saw
those
hard
immovable
rays
softening
vibrating
living
and
he
cried
out
stephanie
stephanie
thou
hearest
me
thou
seest
me
but
she
listened
to
that
cry
as
to
a
noise
the
soughing
of
the
wind
in
the
or
the
lowing
of
the
cow
on
the
back
of
which
she
climbed
then
the
colonel
would
wring
his
hands
in
despair
despair
that
was
new
each
day
one
evening
under
a
calm
sky
amid
the
silence
and
peace
of
that
rural
haven
the
doctor
saw
from
a
distance
that
the
colonel
was
loading
his
pistols
the
old
man
felt
then
that
the
young
man
had
ceased
to
hope
he
felt
the
blood
rushing
to
his
heart
and
if
he
conquered
the
vertigo
that
threatened
him
it
was
because
he
would
rather
see
his
niece
living
and
mad
than
dead
he
hastened
up
what
are
you
doing
he
said
that
is
for
me
replied
the
colonel
pointing
to
a
pistol
already
loaded
which
was
lying
on
the
bench
and
this
is
for
her
he
added
as
he
forced
the
wad
into
the
weapon
he
held
the
countess
was
lying
on
the
ground
beside
him
playing
with
the
balls
then
you
do
not
know
said
the
doctor
coldly
concealing
his
terror
that
in
her
sleep
last
night
she
called
you
philippe
she
called
me
cried
the
baron
dropping
his
pistol
which
stephanie
picked
up
he
took
it
from
her
hastily
caught
up
the
one
that
was
on
the
bench
and
rushed
away
poor
darling
said
the
doctor
happy
in
the
success
of
his
lie
he
pressed
the
poor
creature
to
his
breast
and
continued
speaking
to
himself
he
would
have
killed
thee
selfish
man
because
he
suffers
he
does
not
love
thee
for
thyself
my
child
but
we
forgive
do
we
not
he
is
mad
out
of
his
senses
but
thou
art
only
senseless
no
god
alone
should
call
thee
to
him
we
think
thee
unhappy
we
pity
thee
because
thou
canst
not
share
our
sorrows
fools
that
we
are
but
he
said
sitting
down
and
taking
her
on
his
knee
nothing
troubles
thee
thy
life
is
like
that
of
a
bird
of
a
fawn
as
he
spoke
she
darted
upon
a
young
blackbird
which
was
hopping
near
them
caught
it
with
a
little
note
of
satisfaction
strangled
it
looked
at
it
dead
in
her
hand
and
flung
it
down
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
without
a
thought
the
next
day
as
soon
as
it
was
light
the
colonel
came
down
into
the
gardens
and
looked
about
for
stephanie
he
believed
in
the
coming
happiness
not
finding
her
he
whistled
when
his
darling
came
to
him
he
took
her
on
his
arm
they
walked
together
thus
for
the
first
time
and
he
led
her
within
a
group
of
trees
the
autumn
foliage
of
which
was
dropping
to
the
breeze
the
colonel
sat
down
of
her
own
accord
stephanie
placed
herself
on
his
knee
philippe
trembled
with
joy
love
he
said
kissing
her
hands
passionately
i
am
she
looked
at
him
with
curiosity
come
he
said
pressing
her
to
him
dost
thou
feel
my
heart
it
has
beaten
for
thee
alone
i
love
thee
ever
philippe
is
not
dead
he
is
not
dead
thou
art
on
him
in
his
arms
thou
art
my
stephanie
i
am
thy
adieu
she
said
the
colonel
quivered
for
he
fancied
he
saw
his
own
excitement
communicated
to
his
mistress
his
cry
drawn
from
him
by
despair
that
last
effort
of
an
eternal
love
of
a
delirious
passion
was
successful
the
mind
of
his
darling
was
awaking
ah
stephanie
stephanie
we
shall
yet
be
she
gave
a
cry
of
satisfaction
and
her
eyes
brightened
with
a
flash
of
vague
intelligence
she
knows
me
stephanie
his
heart
swelled
his
eyelids
were
wet
with
tears
then
suddenly
the
countess
showed
him
a
bit
of
sugar
she
had
found
in
his
pocket
while
he
was
speaking
to
her
he
had
mistaken
for
human
thought
the
amount
of
reason
required
for
a
monkey
s
trick
philippe
dropped
to
the
ground
unconscious
monsieur
fanjat
found
the
countess
sitting
on
the
colonel
s
body
she
was
biting
her
sugar
and
testifying
her
pleasure
by
pretty
gestures
and
affectations
with
which
had
she
her
reason
she
might
have
imitated
her
parrot
or
her
cat
ah
my
friend
said
philippe
when
he
came
to
his
senses
i
die
every
day
every
moment
i
love
too
well
i
could
still
bear
all
if
in
her
madness
she
had
kept
her
woman
s
nature
but
to
see
her
always
a
savage
devoid
even
of
modesty
to
see
her
you
want
opera
madness
do
you
something
picturesque
and
pleasing
said
the
doctor
bitterly
your
love
and
your
devotion
yield
before
a
prejudice
monsieur
i
have
deprived
myself
for
your
sake
of
the
sad
happiness
of
watching
over
my
niece
i
have
left
to
you
the
pleasure
of
playing
with
her
i
have
kept
for
myself
the
heaviest
cares
while
you
have
slept
i
have
watched
i
have
go
monsieur
go
abandon
her
leave
this
sad
refuge
i
know
how
to
live
with
that
dear
darling
creature
i
comprehend
her
madness
i
watch
her
gestures
i
know
her
secrets
some
day
you
will
thank
me
for
thus
sending
you
the
colonel
left
the
old
monastery
never
to
return
but
once
the
doctor
was
horrified
when
he
saw
the
effect
he
had
produced
upon
his
guest
whom
he
now
began
to
love
when
he
saw
him
thus
surely
if
either
of
the
two
lovers
were
worthy
of
pity
it
was
philippe
did
he
not
bear
alone
the
burden
of
their
dreadful
sorrow
after
the
colonel
s
departure
the
doctor
kept
himself
informed
about
him
he
learned
that
the
miserable
man
was
living
on
an
estate
near
in
truth
the
baron
on
the
faith
of
a
dream
had
formed
a
project
which
he
believed
would
yet
restore
the
mind
of
his
darling
unknown
to
the
doctor
he
spent
the
rest
of
the
autumn
in
preparing
for
his
enterprise
a
little
river
flowed
through
his
park
and
inundated
during
the
winter
the
marshes
on
either
side
of
it
giving
it
some
resemblance
to
the
beresina
the
village
of
satout
on
the
heights
above
closed
in
like
studzianka
the
scene
of
horror
the
colonel
collected
workmen
to
deepen
the
banks
and
by
the
help
of
his
memory
he
copied
in
his
park
the
shore
where
general
eble
destroyed
the
bridge
he
planted
piles
and
made
buttresses
and
burned
them
leaving
their
charred
and
blackened
ruins
standing
in
the
water
from
shore
to
shore
then
he
gathered
fragments
of
all
kinds
like
those
of
which
the
raft
was
built
he
ordered
dilapidated
uniforms
and
clothing
of
every
grade
and
hired
hundreds
of
peasants
to
wear
them
he
erected
huts
and
cabins
for
the
purpose
of
burning
them
in
short
he
forgot
nothing
that
might
recall
that
most
awful
of
all
scenes
and
he
succeeded
toward
the
last
of
december
when
the
snow
had
covered
with
its
thick
white
mantle
all
his
imitative
preparations
he
recognized
the
beresina
this
false
russia
was
so
terribly
truthful
that
several
of
his
army
comrades
recognized
the
scene
of
their
past
misery
at
once
monsieur
de
sucy
took
care
to
keep
secret
the
motive
for
this
tragic
imitation
which
was
talked
of
in
several
parisian
circles
as
a
proof
of
insanity
early
in
january
the
colonel
drove
in
a
carriage
the
very
counterpart
of
the
one
in
which
he
had
driven
the
comte
and
comtesse
de
vandieres
from
moscow
to
studzianka
the
horses
too
were
like
those
he
had
gone
at
the
peril
of
his
life
to
fetch
from
the
russian
outposts
he
himself
wore
the
soiled
fantastic
clothing
the
same
weapons
as
on
the
of
november
he
had
let
his
beard
grow
also
his
hair
which
was
tangled
and
matted
and
his
face
was
neglected
so
that
nothing
might
be
wanting
to
represent
the
awful
truth
i
can
guess
your
purpose
cried
monsieur
fanjat
when
he
saw
the
colonel
getting
out
of
the
carriage
if
you
want
to
succeed
do
not
let
my
niece
see
you
in
that
equipage
i
will
give
her
opium
during
her
sleep
we
will
dress
her
as
she
was
at
studzianka
and
place
her
in
the
carriage
i
will
follow
you
in
another
about
two
in
the
morning
the
sleeping
countess
was
placed
in
the
carriage
and
wrapped
in
heavy
coverings
a
few
peasants
with
torches
lighted
up
this
strange
abduction
suddenly
a
piercing
cry
broke
the
silence
of
the
night
philippe
and
the
doctor
turned
and
saw
genevieve
coming
from
the
room
in
which
she
slept
adieu
adieu
all
is
over
adieu
she
cried
weeping
hot
tears
genevieve
what
troubles
you
asked
the
doctor
genevieve
shook
her
head
with
a
motion
of
despair
raised
her
arm
to
heaven
looked
at
the
carriage
uttering
a
moan
with
every
sign
of
the
utmost
terror
then
she
returned
to
her
room
silently
that
is
a
good
omen
cried
the
colonel
she
feels
she
is
to
lose
her
companion
perhaps
she
sees
that
stephanie
will
recover
her
god
grant
it
said
monsieur
fanjat
who
himself
was
affected
by
the
incident
ever
since
he
had
made
a
close
study
of
insanity
the
good
man
had
met
with
many
examples
of
the
prophetic
faculty
and
the
gift
of
second
sight
proofs
of
which
are
frequently
given
by
alienated
minds
and
which
may
also
be
found
so
travellers
say
among
certain
tribes
of
savages
as
the
colonel
had
calculated
stephanie
crossed
the
fictitious
plain
of
the
beresina
at
nine
o
clock
in
the
morning
when
she
was
awakened
by
a
cannon
shot
not
a
hundred
yards
from
the
spot
where
the
experiment
was
to
be
tried
this
was
a
signal
hundreds
of
peasants
made
a
frightful
clamor
like
that
on
the
shore
of
the
river
that
memorable
night
when
twenty
thousand
stragglers
were
doomed
to
death
or
slavery
by
their
own
folly
at
the
cry
at
the
shot
the
countess
sprang
from
the
carriage
and
ran
with
delirious
emotion
over
the
snow
to
the
banks
of
the
river
she
saw
the
burned
bivouacs
and
the
charred
remains
of
the
bridge
and
the
fatal
raft
which
the
men
were
launching
into
the
icy
waters
of
the
beresina
the
major
philippe
was
there
striking
back
the
crowd
with
his
sabre
madame
de
vandieres
gave
a
cry
which
went
to
all
hearts
and
threw
herself
before
the
colonel
whose
heart
beat
wildly
she
seemed
to
gather
herself
together
and
at
first
looked
vaguely
at
the
singular
scene
for
an
instant
as
rapid
as
the
lightning
s
flash
her
eyes
had
that
lucidity
devoid
of
mind
which
we
admire
in
the
eye
of
birds
then
passing
her
hand
across
her
brow
with
the
keen
expression
of
one
who
meditates
she
contemplated
the
living
memory
of
a
past
scene
spread
before
her
and
turning
quickly
to
philippe
she
saw
him
an
awful
silence
reigned
in
the
crowd
the
colonel
gasped
but
dared
not
speak
the
doctor
wept
stephanie
s
sweet
face
colored
faintly
then
from
tint
to
tint
it
returned
to
the
brightness
of
youth
till
it
glowed
with
a
beautiful
crimson
life
and
happiness
lighted
by
intelligence
came
nearer
and
nearer
like
a
conflagration
convulsive
trembling
rose
from
her
feet
to
her
heart
then
these
phenomena
seemed
to
blend
in
one
as
stephanie
s
eyes
cast
forth
a
celestial
ray
the
flame
of
a
living
soul
she
lived
she
thought
she
shuddered
with
fear
perhaps
for
god
himself
unloosed
that
silent
tongue
and
cast
anew
his
fires
into
that
soul
human
will
came
with
its
full
electric
torrent
and
vivified
the
body
from
which
it
had
been
driven
stephanie
cried
the
colonel
oh
it
is
philippe
said
the
poor
countess
she
threw
herself
into
the
trembling
arms
that
the
colonel
held
out
to
her
and
the
clasp
of
the
lovers
frightened
the
spectators
stephanie
burst
into
tears
suddenly
her
tears
stopped
she
stiffened
as
though
the
lightning
had
touched
her
and
said
in
a
feeble
voice
adieu
philippe
i
love
thee
adieu
oh
she
is
dead
cried
the
colonel
opening
his
arms
the
old
doctor
received
the
inanimate
body
of
his
niece
kissed
it
as
though
he
were
a
young
man
and
carrying
it
aside
sat
down
with
it
still
in
his
arms
on
a
pile
of
wood
he
looked
at
the
countess
and
placed
his
feeble
trembling
hand
upon
her
heart
that
heart
no
longer
beat
it
is
true
he
said
looking
up
at
the
colonel
who
stood
motionless
and
then
at
stephanie
on
whom
death
was
placing
that
resplendent
beauty
that
fugitive
halo
which
is
perhaps
a
pledge
of
the
glorious
future
yes
she
is
ah
that
smile
cried
philippe
do
you
see
that
smile
can
it
be
true
she
is
turning
cold
replied
monsieur
fanjat
monsieur
de
sucy
made
a
few
steps
to
tear
himself
away
from
the
sight
but
he
stopped
whistled
the
air
that
stephanie
had
known
and
when
she
did
not
come
to
him
went
on
with
staggering
steps
like
a
drunken
man
still
whistling
but
never
turning
back
general
philippe
de
sucy
was
thought
in
the
social
world
to
be
a
very
agreeable
man
and
above
all
a
very
gay
one
a
few
days
ago
a
lady
complimented
him
on
his
good
humor
and
the
charming
equability
of
his
nature
ah
madame
he
said
i
pay
dear
for
my
liveliness
in
my
lonely
are
you
ever
alone
she
said
no
he
replied
smiling
if
a
judicious
observer
of
human
nature
could
have
seen
at
that
moment
the
expression
on
the
comte
de
sucy
s
face
he
would
perhaps
have
shuddered
why
don
t
you
marry
said
the
lady
who
had
several
daughters
at
school
you
are
rich
titled
and
of
ancient
lineage
you
have
talents
and
a
great
future
before
you
all
things
smile
upon
yes
he
said
but
a
smile
kills
the
next
day
the
lady
heard
with
great
astonishment
that
monsieur
de
sucy
had
blown
his
brains
out
during
the
night
the
upper
ranks
of
society
talked
in
various
ways
over
this
extraordinary
event
and
each
person
looked
for
the
cause
of
it

to
the
proclivities
of
each

love
ambition

a

was
one
of
those
strong
men
to
whom

has
given
the
unhappy
power
of
