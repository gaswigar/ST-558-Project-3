preface
writers
on
arms
and
armour
have
approached
the
subject
from
many
points
of
view
but
as
all
students
know
their
works
are
generally
so
large
in
size
or
what
is
more
essential
in
price
that
for
many
who
do
not
have
access
to
large
libraries
it
is
impossible
to
learn
much
that
is
required
then
again
the
papers
of
the
proceedings
of
the
various
antiquarian
and
archaeological
societies
are
in
all
cases
very
scattered
and
in
some
cases
unattainable
owing
to
their
being
out
of
print
many
writers
on
the
subject
have
confined
themselves
to
documentary
evidence
while
others
have
only
written
about
such
examples
as
have
been
spared
by
time
and
rust
these
latter
it
may
be
noted
are
in
almost
all
cases
such
as
the
brasses
and
effigies
in
our
churches
quite
exceptional
representing
as
they
do
the
defences
and
weapons
of
the
richer
classes
what
the
ordinary
man
wore
how
he
wore
it
and
how
it
was
made
are
all
questions
worthy
of
attention
the
works
of
our
greatest
romancers
have
so
little
regarded
the
development
of
armour
and
even
such
anachronisms
are
seen
in
pictures
and
books
that
though
many
comfortable
and
picturesque
notions
may
be
disturbed
by
the
actual
truth
yet
the
actual
truth
will
be
found
to
be
no
less
interesting
than
fiction
a
handy
work
not
excessive
in
size
or
price
and
giving
really
correct
information
seems
therefore
to
be
needed
and
should
be
popular
such
a
work
is
this
which
ffoulkes
has
undertaken
and
if
we
recognize
what
an
immense
amount
of
information
has
to
be
condensed
within
the
limits
of
a
handbook
i
think
we
shall
fully
appreciate
his
endeavours
to
give
an
appetite
for
larger
feasts

many
of
those
who
attended
my
course
of
lectures
delivered
before
the
university
of
oxford
during
the
lent

i
have
collected
and
illustrated
some
of
the
more
important
notes
dealing
with
the
development
of
european
defensive
armour
and
weapons
these
pages
are
not
a
mere
reprint
of
those
lectures
nor
do
they
aspire
to
the
dignity
of
a
history
of
armour
they
are
simply
intended
as
a
handbook
for
use
in
studying
history
and
a
short
guide
to
the
somewhat
intricate
technicalities
of
the
craft
of
the
armourer
no
work
even
of
the
smallest
dimensions
can
be
produced
at

its
author
under

introduction
as
a
subject
for
careful
study
and
exhaustive
investigation
perhaps
no
detail
of
human
existence
can
be
examined
with
quite
the
same
completeness
as
can
the
defensive
armour
and
weapons
of
past
ages
most
departments
of
literature
science
and
art
are
still
living
realities
each
is
still
developing
and
is
subject
to
evolution
as
occasion
demands
and
for
this
reason
our
knowledge
of
these
subjects
can
not
be
final
and
our
researches
can
only
be
brought
so
to
speak
up
to
date
the
defensive
armour
of
europe
however
has
its
definite
limitations
so
surely
set
that
we
can
surround
our
investigations
with
permanent
boundaries
which
as
far
as
human
mind
can
judge
will
never
be
enlarged
we
can
look
at
our
subject
as
a
whole
and
can
see
its
whole
length
and
breadth
spread
out
before
us
in
other
aspects
of
life
we
can
only
limit
our
studies
from
day
to
day
as
invention
or
discovery
push
farther
their
conquering
march
but
in
dealing
with
the
armour
of
our
ancestors
we
know
that
although
we
may
still
indulge
in
theories
as
to
ancient
forms
and
usages
we
have
very
definitely
before
us
in
the
primitive
beginnings
the
gradual
development
the
perfection
and
the
decadence
or
passing
away
an
absolutely
unique
progression
and
evolution
which
we
can
find
in
no
other
condition
of
life
the
survival
of
the
fittest
held
good
of
defensive
armour
until
that
very
fitness
was
found
to
be
a
source
rather
of
weakness
than
of
strength
owing
to
changed
conditions
of
warfare
and
then
the
mighty
defences
of
steel
impervious
to
sword
lance
and
arrow
passed
away
to
remain
only
as
adjuncts
of
parade
and
pageant
or
as
examples
in
museums
of
a
lost
art
in
warfare
and
military
history
as
an
aid
to
the
study
of
history
our
interest
in
armour
may
be
considered
perhaps
rather
sentimental
and
romantic
than
practical
or
useful
but
if
we
consider
the
history
of
the
art
of
war
we
shall
find
that
our
subject
will
materially
assist
us
when
we
remember
that
the
growth
of
nations
and
their
fortunes
at
any
rate
till
recent
times
have
depended
to
a
large
extent
on
the
sword
and
the
strength
of
the
arm
that
wielded
it
there
is
another
aspect
of
historical
study
which
is
of
some
importance
especially
to
those
who
stand
on
the
outskirts
of
the
subject
this
aspect
one
may
call
the
view
the
late
professors
york
powell
and
green
both
insisted
on
the
importance
of
this
side
of
the
subject
and
we
can
not
but
feel
that
to
be
able
to
visualize
the
characters
of
history
and
to
endow
them
with
personal
attributes
and
personal
equipment
must
give
additional
interest
to
the
printed
page
and
other
documentary
evidences
when
the
study
of
defensive
armour
has
been
carefully
followed
we
shall
find
that
the
black
prince
appears
to
us
not
merely
as
a
name
and
a
landmark
on
the
long
road
of
time
we
shall
be
able
to
picture
him
to
ourselves
as
a
living
individual
dressed
in
a
distinctive
fashion
and
limited
in
his
actions
to
some
extent
by
that
very
dress
and
equipment
the
cut
of
a
surcoat
the
hilt
of
a
sword
the
lines
of
a
breastplate
will
tell
us
with
some
degree
of
accuracy
when
a
man
lived
and
to
what
nation
he
belonged
and
at
the
same
time
in
the
later
years
we
shall
find
that
the
suit
of
plate
not
only
proclaims
the
individuality
of
the
wearer
but
also
bears
the
signature
and
individuality
of
the
maker
a
combination
of
interests
which
few
works
of
handicraft
can
offer
us
from
the
eleventh
to
the
end
of
the
fourteenth
century
we
have
but
a
few
scattered
examples
of
actual
defensive
armour
and
arms
and
the
authenticity
of
many
of
these
is
open
to
doubt
the
reason
for
this
scarcity
is
twofold
firstly
because
the
material
in
spite
of
its
strength
is
liable
to
destruction
by
rust
and
corrosion
especially
when
the
armour
is
of
the
interlinked
chain
type
which
exposes
a
maximum
surface
to
the
atmosphere
a
second
reason
of
equal
if
not
greater
importance
is
the
fact
that
owing
to
the
expense
of
manufacture
and
material
the
various
portions
of
the
knightly
equipment
were
remade
and
altered
to
suit
new
fashions
and
requirements
perhaps
still
another
reason
may
be
found
in
the
carelessness
and
lack
of
antiquarian
interest
in
our
ancestors
who
as
soon
as
a
particular
style
had
ceased
to
be
in
vogue
destroyed
or
sold
as
useless
lumber
objects
which
would
be
of
incalculable
interest
and
value
for
these
reasons
therefore
we
are
dependent
for
the
earlier
periods
of
our
subject
upon
those
illuminated
manuscripts
and
sculptured
monuments
which
preserve
examples
of
the
accoutrements
of
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
of
these
as
far
as
reliability
of
date
is
concerned
the
incised
monumental
brasses
and
sculptured
effigies
in
our
churches
are
the
best
guides
because
they
were
produced
shortly
after
the
death
of
the
persons
they
represent
and
are
therefore
more
likely
to
be
correct
in
the
details
of
dress
and
equipment
and
in
addition
they
are
often
portraits
of
the
deceased
illuminated
manuscripts
present
more
difficulty
the
miniature
painter
of
the
period
was
often
fantastic
in
his
ideas
and
was
certainly
not
an
antiquary
even
the
giants
of
the
renaissance
raphael
mantegna
titian
and
the
rest
saw
nothing
incongruous
in
arming
george
in
a
suit
of
milanese
plate
or
a
roman
soldier
of
the
first
years
of
the
christian
epoch
in
a
fluted
breastplate
of
nuremberg
make
religious
and
historical
legends
were
in
those
days
present
and
living
realities
and
to
the
unlearned
details
of
antiquarian
interest
would
have
been
useless
for
instructive
purposes
whereas
the
garbing
of
mythical
or
historical
characters
in
the
dress
of
the
period
made
their
lives
and
actions
seem
a
part
of
the
everyday
life
of
those
who
studied
them
this
being
the
case
we
must
use
our
judgement
in
researches
among
illustrated
manuscripts
and
must
be
prepared
for
anachronisms
for
example
we
find
that
in
the
illustrated
froissart
in
the
british
museum
known
as
the
de
commines
copy
the
barrier
or
which
separated
the
knights
when
jousting
is
represented
in
the
tournament
of
inglevert
now
this
tournament
took
place
in
the
year
but
monstrelet
tells
us
that
the
tilt
was
first
used
at
arras
in
that
is
some
forty
years
after
this
illustrated
edition
of
froissart
was
produced
at
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
when
the
tilt
was
in
common
use
so
we
must
in
this
and
in
other
like
cases
use
the
illustrations
not
as
examples
of
the
periods
which
they
record
but
as
delineations
of
the
manners
customs
and
dress
of
the
period
at
which
they
were
produced
the
different
methods
of
arming
were
much
the
same
all
over
europe
but
in
england
fashions
were
adopted
only
after
they
had
been
in
vogue
for
some
years
in
france
italy
and
germany
we
may
pride
ourselves
however
on
the
fact
that
our
ancestors
were
not
so
prone
to
exaggeration
in
style
or
to
the
decoration
which
was
in
such
favour
on
the
continent
during
the
latter
part
of
the
sixteenth
and
the
first
half
of
the
seventeenth
centuries
for
a
fuller
study
of
this
subject
sir
samuel
meyrick
great
work
on
ancient
armour
is
useful
if
the
student
bears
in
mind
that
the
author
was
but
a
pioneer
and
that
many
of
his
statements
have
since
been
corrected
in
the
light
of
recent
investigations
and
also
that
the
meyrick
collection
which
he
so
frequently
uses
to
illustrate
his
remarks
is
now
dispersed
through
all
the
museums
of
europe
of
all
the
authorities
the
most
trustworthy
and
most
minute
and
careful
in
both
text
and
illustrations
is
hewitt
whose
three
volumes
on
ancient
armour
have
been
the
groundwork
of
all
subsequent
works
in
english
some
of
the
more
recent
writers
are
prone
to
use
hewitt
infinite
care
and
research
without
acknowledging
the
fact
but
they
have
very
seldom
improved
upon
his
methods
or
added
to
his
investigations
for
the
later
periods
which
hewitt
has
not
covered
so
fully
as
he
has
the
earlier
portion
of
his
subject
the
of
the
various
museums
of
england
and
europe
will
assist
the
student
more
than
any
history
that
could
possibly
be
compiled
chapter
i
the
age
of
mail
with
the
norman
conquest
we
may
be
said
in
england
to
enter
upon
the
iron
period
of
defensive
armour
the
old
methods
were
still
in
use
but
were
gradually
superseded
by
the
craft
of
the
smith
and
the
this
use
of
iron
for
defensive
purposes
had
been
in
vogue
for
some
time
on
the
continent
for
we
find
the
monk
of
gall
writing
bitterly
on
the
subject
in
his
of
he
says
could
be
seen
the
iron
charles
helmed
with
an
iron
helm
his
iron
breast
and
his
broad
shoulders
defended
by
an
iron
breastplate
an
iron
spear
raised
in
his
left
hand
his
right
always
rested
on
his
unconquered
iron
falchion
the
thighs
which
with
most
men
are
uncovered
that
they
may
the
more
easily
ride
on
horseback
were
in
his
case
clad
with
plates
of
iron
i
need
make
no
special
mention
of
his
greaves
for
the
greaves
of
all
the
army
were
of
iron
his
shield
was
of
iron
his
charger
and
the
fields
and
open
places
were
filled
with
iron
a
people
stronger
than
iron
paid
universal
homage
to
the
strength
of
iron
the
horror
of
the
dungeon
seemed
less
than
the
bright
gleam
of
the
iron
oh
the
iron
woe
for
the
iron
was
the
cry
of
the
citizens
the
strong
walls
shook
at
the
sight
of
iron
the
resolution
of
old
and
young
fell
before
the
iron
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
and
working
metal
however
was
such
that
it
was
only
used
by
the
wealthy
and
that
sparingly
the
more
common
fashion
of
arming
was
a
quilted
fabric
of
either
linen
or
cloth
a
very
serviceable
protection
which
was
worn
up
to
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
another
favourite
material
for
defensive
purposes
was
leather
we
read
of
the
shield
of
ajax
being
composed
of
seven
tough
and
the
word
itself
suggests
a
leather
garment
now
given
either
the
leather
or
the
quilted
fabric
it
is
but
natural
with
the
discovery
and
use
of
iron
that
it
should
have
been
added
in
one
form
or
another
to
reinforce
the
less
rigid
material
and
it
is
this
reinforcing
by
plates
of
metal
side
by
side
with
the
use
of
the
interlaced
chain
armour
which
step
by
step
brings
us
to
the
magnificent
creations
of
the
craft
which
distinguish
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
sir
samuel
meyrick
leads
us
into
endless
intricacies
with
his
theories
of
the
various
kinds
of
defensive
armour
in
use
at
the
time
of
the
conquest
but
these
theories
must
of
necessity
be
based
only
upon
personal
opinion
and
can
in
no
way
be
borne
out
by
concrete
examples
if
we
take
the
pictured
representations
of
armour
as
our
guide
we
find
certain
arrangements
of
lines
which
lead
us
to
suppose
that
they
indicate
some
peculiar
arrangement
of
metal
upon
a
fabric
the
first
and
oldest
of
these
varieties
is
generally
called
or
imbricate
armour
we
find
this
represented
on
the
trajan
column
to
give
only
one
of
the
many
examples
of
its
use
in
very
early
times
that
it
was
a
very
pliant
and
serviceable
defence
we
may
judge
from
the
fact
that
with
some
alteration
in
its
application
it
formed
the
distinguishing
feature
of
the
brigandine
of
the
fifteenth
century
the
scales
were
sewn
upon
a
leather
or
quilted
garment
the
upper
row
overlapping
the
lower
in
such
a
manner
that
the
attachment
is
covered
and
protected
from
injury
plate
i
the
scales
were
either
formed
with
the
lower
edge
rounded
like
the
scales
of
a
fish
or
were
or
square
another
method
of
reinforcing
the
leather

coat
it
is
always
difficult
to
discover
exactly
what
the
primitive
draughtsman
intended
to
represent
in
the
way
of
fabrics
and
it
is
quite
open
to
question
whether
these
diagonal
lines
may
not
merely
suggest
a
quilting
of
linen
or
cloth
if
it
is
intended
to
represent
leather
the
trellice
lines
would
probably
be
formed
of
thongs
applied
on
to
the
groundwork
with
metal
studs
riveted
in
the
intervening

by

it
is
quite
probable
that
the
circular
discs
may
have
been
solid
but
on
the
other
hand
from
the
practical
point
of
view
a
ring
gives
equal
protection
against
a
cutting
blow
and
is
of
course
much
lighter
the
illustration
of
this
form
of
defensive
armour
is
of
rather
earlier
date
than
that
at
which
we
commence
our
investigations
but
it
appears
with
some
frequency
in
manuscripts
of
the
twelfth
century
waller
in
his
article
on
the
hauberk
of
mail
in
vol
lix
is
of
opinion
that
all
these
arrangements
of
line
represent
interlinked
chain
armour
if
this
is
the
case
must
have
been
much
more
common
than
we
imagine
from
the
very
nature
of
its
construction
and
the
labour
expended
on
its
intricate
manufacture
it
would
surely
at
least
in
the
earlier
periods
have
been
only
the
defence
of
the
wealthy
when
we
examine
the
protective
armour
of
primitive
races
we
find
quilted
and
studded
garments
used
even
at
the
present
day
so
it
seems
far
more
probable
that
our
illustrations
represent
some
similar
forms
of
defensive
garments
than
that
they
are
all
incompetent
renderings
of
the
fabric
of
only
that
the
making
of
must
have
been
laborious
in
the
extreme
we
may
judge
from
the
fact
that
the
wire
which
formed
the
links
had
to
be
hammered
out
from
the
solid
bar
or
ingot
as
far
as
can
be
gathered
the
art
of
was
not
practised
till
the
fourteenth
century
at
which
time
rudolph
of
nuremberg
is
credited
with
its
discovery
the
strips
were
probably
twisted
spirally
round
an
iron
or
wood
core
and
then
cut
off
into
rings
of
equal
size
fig
the
ends
of
the
rings
were
flattened
and
pierced
and
when
interlaced
the
pierced
ends
were
riveted
together
or
sometimes
as
is
the
case
with
oriental
mail
welded
with
heat
links
that
are
that
is
with
the
ends
of
the
ring
merely
butted
together
and
not
joined
generally
show
either
that
the
mail
is
an
imitation
or
that
it
was
used
for
some
ceremonial
purpose
for
this
insecure
method
of
fixing
would
be
useless
in
the
stress
and
strain
of
battle
or
active
service
the
most
usual
method
of
interlinking
the
rings
is
for
each
ring
to
join
four
others
as
will
be
seen
in
the
drawing
on
plate
i
no
no
on
the
same

the

as
more
generally
depicted
in
illuminations
when
we
consider
the
inexperience
of
the
scribes
and
illustrators
of
the
middle
ages
we
must
admit
that
this
representation
of
a
very
intricate
fabric
is
not
only
very
ingenious
but
follows
quite
the
best
modern
impressionist
doctrines
portions
of
survive
in
most
armouries
and
museums
but
their
provenance
is
generally
unknown
and
much
that
is
of
oriental
origin
is
passed
off
as
european
itself
comes
in
the
first
instance
from
the
east
but
when
it
was
introduced
into
europe
is
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
state
it
is
certainly
represented
as
worn
by
the
scythians
and
parthians
on
the
trajan
column
and
is
probably
of
greater
antiquity

probable
method
of
making
links
for
mail
from
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
for
about
sixty
or
seventy
years
we
find
a
curious
arrangement
of
lines
intended
to
represent
a
form
of
defensive
armour
both
in
illuminated
manuscripts
and
also
on
carved
monuments
plate
i
waller
in
the
article
on
the
hauberk
referred
to
above
gives
it
as
his
opinion
that
this
mail
as
it
is
called
was
but
a
variety
of
the
ordinary
interlinked
mail
but
if
we
examine
the
illuminations
of
the
period
we
shall
find
that
it
is
shown
side
by
side
with
the
representation
of
what
all
authorities
admit
to
be
no
on
plate
i
shows
the
arm
and
leg
defences
to
be
formed
of
this
banded
mail
while
the
head
is
protected
with
the
ordinary
we
have
then
to
try
and
discover
how
these
horizontal
bands
dividing
each
row
of
links
in
the
mail
can
be
shown
in
a
practical
form
meyrick
vaguely
suggests
a
row
of
rings
sewn
edgeways
on
the
body
garment
and
threaded
with
a
leather
thong
plate
i
with
the
under
fabric
caught
up
between
the
rows
of
rings
and
formed
into
a
piping
through
which
a
cord
was
threaded
this
theory
has
been
quoted
by
in
his
du
mobilier
by
wendelin
boeheim
in
his
and
by
more
recent
writers
but
none
of
these
authorities
seems
to
have
taken
the
trouble
to
test
its
practicability
the
human
body
being
rounded
the
tendency
of
these
rings
would
be
to
and
thus
give
an
opening
for
the
weapon
in
addition
to
this
the
number
of
rings
so
used
would
make
the
weight
of
the
defence
hanging
as
it
did
from
the
shoulders
alone
almost
insupportable
a
third
and
perhaps
the
most
conclusive
of
all
the
arguments
against
meyrick
theory
is
that
we
frequently
find
the
inside
of
a
banded
mail
coif
shown
with
the
same
markings
as
the
outside
which
aspect
would
be
impossible
if
the
rings
were
arranged
as
he
suggests
from
models
specially
made
for
this
work
we
find
that
if
leather
was
used
at
all
it
must
be
after
the
manner
of
no
on
plate
i
here
the
rings
are
covered
with
the
leather
on
both
sides
so
that
there
is
no
possibility
of
their
gaping
and
in
addition
the
leather
being
pressed
against
the
rings
on
the
outside
by
wear
and
usage
and
on
the
inside
from
the
pressure
of
the
body
would
show
on
front
and
back
which
might
be
represented
in
the
manner
shown
in
the
illustration
the
drawback
to
this
theory
is
not
only
the
weight
of
such
a
defence
but
also
the
heat
from
lack
of
ventilation
by
far
the
most
practical
theory
put
forward
is
that
of
waller
who
gives
an
illustration
of
a
piece
of
oriental
mail
with
leather
thongs
threaded
through
each
alternate
row
of
rings
this
gives
a
certain
solidity
to
the
fabric
and
yet
does
not
add
appreciably
to
its
weight
no
on
plate
i
shows
this
arrangement
drawn
from
a
model
and
when
we
compare
it
with
the
figures
below
taking
into
consideration
the
difficulty
of
representing
such
a
fabric
we
are
forced
to
admit
that
this
last
theory
is
the
most
practical
this
is
especially
so
in
no
for
the
mail
covering
for
the
head
is
probably
made
in
one
piece
with
that
of
the
arms
and
legs
but
the
leather
thongs
have
been
omitted
on
the
head
and
hands
to
give
greater
ease
of
movement
before
leaving
the
subject
of
fabrics
it
may
be
well
to
warn
those
who
consult
meyrick
that
this
author
is
rather
prone
to
enunciate
theories
of
the
different
forms
of
mail
which
like
that
of
the
banded
mail
do
not
work
well
in
practice
he
mentions
among
many
other
varieties
what
he
calls
mail
he
asserts
that
this
was
formed
of
plates
cut
out
in
the
centre
and
applied
to
linen
or
leather
he
says
that
it
was
so
called
from
its
likeness
to
the
meshes
of
a
net
lat
now
when
we
consider
that
the
word
itself
comes
to
us
from
the
latin
through
the
french
and
the
italian
we
find
that
meyrick
mail
is
but
a
tautological
expression
which
can
best
be
applied
to
the
fabric
of
the
interlinked
chain
defence
and
so
his
mail
would
more
correctly
be
styled
a
coat
and
this
coat
would
probably
be
formed
of
the
chain
variety
as
resembling
the
meshes
of
a
net
more
closely
than
any
other
fabric
double
mail
is
sometimes
to
be
met
with
on
carved
monuments
and
this
would
be
constructed
in
the
same
manner
as
the
single
mail
but
two
links
would
be
used
together
in
every
case
where
one
is
used
in
the
single
mail
having
briefly
described
the
varieties
of
fabric
and
material
which
were
in
use
at
the
time
of
the
conquest
for
defensive
armour
we
may
pass
to
the
forms
in
which
those
materials
were
made
up
the
first
garment
put
on
by
the
was
the
tunic
which
was
a
short
linen
shirt
reaching
usually
to
just
above
the
knee
it
is
often
shown
in
miniatures
of
the
period
beneath
the
edge
of
the
coat
of
mail
at
one
period
the
tunic
appears
to
have
been
worn
inconveniently
long
if
we
are
to
judge
from
the
seals
of
richard
i
in
which
it
is
shown
reaching
to
the
feet
this
long
was
quite
given
up
by
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
those
representations
of
joan
of
arc
which
show
a
long
falling
from
beneath
the
breastplate
are
based
upon
no
reliable
authority
next
to
the
tunic
was
worn
the
gambeson
called
also
the
wambais
and
aketon
a
quilted
garment
either
used
as
the
sole
defence
by
the
or
by
the
knight
worn
under
the
hauberk
to
prevent
the
from
bruising
the
body
under
the
impact
of
a
blow
the
gambeson
is
shown
on
fig
appearing
beneath
the
edge
of
the
hauberk
just
above
the
knee
the
hauberk
which
was
worn
over
the
gambeson
was
the
chief
body
defence
it
is
true
that
we
read
of
a
de
fer
which
seems
to
have
been
a
solid
metal
plate
worn
over
the
breast
and
sometimes
at
the
back
but
it
was
invariably
put
on
either
under
the
hauberk
itself
or
over
the
hauberk
but
always
beneath
the
jupon
or
surcoat
which
at
this
period
was
the
outermost
garment
worn
in
either
case
it
was
not
exposed
to
view
so
it
is
impossible
to
tell
with
any
degree
of
accuracy
what
was
its
shape
or
how
it
was
fixed
to
the
wearer
hewitt
gives
two
illustrations
of
carved
wooden
figures
in
bamberg
cathedral
which
show
a
plastron
de
fer
worn
over
the
jupon
which
seems
to
be
studded
with
metal
the
figures
were
executed
about
the
year
the
form
of
the
hauberk
as
shown
on
the
bayeux
tapestry
was
of
the
shirt
order
plate
i
it
was
usually
slit
to
the
waist
front
and
back
for
convenience
on
horseback
and
the
skirts
reached
to
the
knee
thus
protecting
the
upper
leg
it
is
perhaps
needless
to
point
out
that
the
extreme
weight
of
mail
with
its
thick
padded
undergarment
made
the
use
of
a
horse
a
necessity
for
the
weight
was
all
borne
upon
the
shoulders
and
was
not
as
is
the
case
with
suits
of
plate
distributed
over
the
limbs
and
body
of
the
wearer
the
sleeves
of
the
hauberk
were
sometimes
short
sometimes
they
were
long
and
ended
in
fingerless
mittens
of
mail
the
three
varieties
of
sleeve
are
shown
on
plate
i
while
the
mittens
turned
back
to
leave
the
hand
bare
appear
on
the

plate
iii
wace
the
chronicler
seems
to
suggest
different
forms
of
defensive
habiliments
for
we
find
mention
of
a
short
form
of
the
hauberk
called
the
haubergeon
in
his
de
he
writes
of
duke
william
at
the
battle
of
senlac

boen
haubert
fist
demander
while
of
bishop
odo
he
says
un
haubergeon
aveit
vestu
de
sor
une
chemise
blanche
the
fact
that
he
mentions
the
tunic
blanche
seems
to
imply
that
it
was
seen
beneath
the
hem
of
the
haubergeon
which
would
not
be
the
case
with
the
hauberk
occasionally
in
illuminated
manuscripts
the
hauberk
is
shown
slit
at
the
sides
but
for
what
purpose
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
for
it
would
impede
the
wearer
when
walking
and
would
make
riding
an
impossibility
the
defences
of
the
leg
made
of
mail
like
the
hauberk
seem
to
have
been
used
at
first
only
by
the
nobles
if
the
bayeux
tapestry
is
taken
as
a
guide
the
common
soldiers
wore
linen
or
leather
swathings
sometimes
studded
with
metal
but
in
appearance
closely
resembling
the
modern
puttee
the
upper
portion
of
the
leg
was
protected
at
a
later
period
with
chaussons
while
the
defences
from
knee
to
foot
were
called
chausses

de

but
we
must
remember
as
was
noticed
in
the
introduction
that
wace
wrote
some
seventy
years
after
the
conquest
and
probably
described
the
accoutrements
worn
at
his
own
time
the
bayeux
tapestry
is
nearer
the
period
as
far
as
we
can
date
it
with
any
correctness
but
here
we
are
hampered
to
some
extent
by
the
crude
methods
of
the
embroideress
the
chaussons
are
not
often
shown
in
illuminations
for
the
hauberk
covers
the
leg
to
the
knee
but
the
chausses
appear
in
all
pictorial
and
sculptured
records
of
the
period
made
either
of
mail
or
of
pourpointerie
that
is
fabric
studded
with
metal
towards
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
chaussons
and
chausses
were
made
in
one
form
covering
the
foot
this
is
shown
on
plate
i
in
the
first
of
these
illustrations
only
the
front
of
the
leg
is
covered
and
the
chausses
are
laced
at
the
back
as
the
manufacture
of
mail
progressed
the
whole
of
the
wearer
person
came
to
be
protected
by
it
in
addition
to
the
coverings
of
the
body
we
find
continuations
that
protected
arms
and
legs
and
in
course
of
time
the
neck
and
head
were
protected
with
a
coif
or
hood
of
mail
which
is
shown
in
use
in
plate

and
thrown

on

of

use
the
surcoat
is
so
essentially
part
of
the
war
equipment
of
the
knight
that
it
needs
more
than
a
passing
notice
it
first
appears
on
royal
seals
at
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
in
the
reign
of
king
john
some
modern
writers
have
suggested
that
it
was
first
used
in
the
crusades
to
keep
the
sun
off
the
mail
however
this
may
be
we
have
written
proof
that
it
was
of
use
in
protecting
the
intricate
fabric
of
chain
armour
from
the
wet
which
by
rusting
the
metal
played
havoc
with
its
serviceability
it
will
be
seen
in
different
lengths
in
the
figures
on
plate

in

the
surcoat
was

to

in

and
behind
for
convenience
on
horseback
and
was
usually
girt
at
the
waist
with
a

it
was
frequently
decorated
with
the
armorial
bearings
of
the
wearer
when
the
barrel
helm
was
worn
concealing
the
whole

some
such
cognizance

necessary
that
the

might
be
recognized

the

we
should
draw
a
distinction

helmet
and

helm
the
former
is
of
course
a
diminutive
of
the
latter
at
the
time
of
the
norman
conquest
the
head
covering
would
rank
rather
as
a
helmet
as
it
did
not
entirely
cover

face

norman
helmet
was
conical

formed
of
four

pieces

i
that
this
nasal
must
have
been
broad
enough
to
conceal
the
face
to
a
great
extent
we
may
judge
from
the
story
how
the
norman

how
william

we
sometimes

the
great
seals
of
the
kings
are
a
most
useful
guide
in
discovering
the
accoutrements
of
each
period
and
especially
so
for
the
helms
and
helmets
which
are
easier
to
distinguish
than
the
more
minute
details
of
dress
and
equipment
it
will
be
understood
that
in
time
the
helm
was
given
up
in
favour
of
the
helm
fig
as
it
is
generally
called
when
we
consider
the
importance
of
a
surface
in
armour
although
thickness
of
material
was
of
some
importance
in
defensive
armour
this
providing
of
surfaces
from
which
a
weapon
would
slip
was
considered
to
be
of
supreme
importance
by
the
of
later
periods
in
the
conical
helm
as
indeed
in
nearly
all
great
helms
the
vision
and
breathing
apertures
were
pierced
in
the
plates
of
the
helm
itself
and
were
not
part
of
a
movable
visor
as
was
the
case
in
the
helmet
the
weight
of
these
helms
must
have
been
great
for
they
do
not
seem
to
have
been
bolted
on
to
the
shoulders
as
were
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
century
tilting
helms
but
to
have
rested
upon
the
crown
of
the
head
the
drawing
on
plate
i
no
shows
a
padded
cap
which
was
worn
under
the
mail
to
protect
the
head
from
pressure
on
no
of
the
same
plate
we
see
the
helm
being
put
on
over
the
mail
coif
the
padded
cap
is
worn
under
the
mail
for
tournaments
the
helm
was
sometimes
made
of
toughened
leather
which
was
called
from
the
fact
that
it
was
prepared
by
being
boiled
in
oil
and
then
moulded
to
shape
this
material
was
very
strong
and
serviceable
and
was
used
as
we
shall
see
later
on
for
reinforcing
the
chain
armour
and
also
for
horse
armour
it
was
generally
decorated
with
gilding
and
painting
for
the
tournament
held
at
windsor
in
we
find
mention
of
galee
de
cor
as
we
have
shown
these
great
helms
were
not
attached
to
the
body
armour
and
were
thus
liable
to
be
struck
off
in
battle
in
order
to
recover
them
a
chain
was
sometimes
stapled
to
the
helm
and
fastened
to
the
waist
or
some
portion
of
the
body
armour
fig
the
usual
form
of
helmet
in
the
twelfth
century
is
the
headpiece
of
which
the
cervelli√®re
is
a
typical
example
fig
it
was
either
worn
as
the
sole
defence
or
was
used
in
conjunction
with
the
helm

the
shield
at
the
time
of
the
conquest
was
it
was
long
enough
to
cover
the
body
and
legs
of
the
warrior
when
mounted
but
it
must
have
been
a
most
inconvenient
adjunct
to
his
accoutrements
as
we
have
seen
in
the
monk
of
gall
records
the
shield
was
sometimes
made
of
iron
but
the
more
usual
material
was
wood
covered
with
leather
or
the
tough
cuirbouilli
its
broad
flat
surface
was
from
the
earliest
times
used
by
the
painter
to
display
his
art
which
at
first
was
not
systematized
but
consisted
of
geometrical
patterns
and
strange
birds
and
beasts
that
had
no
special
meaning
as
time
went
on
each
knight
retained
the
device
which
was
borne
upon
his
shield
and
came
to
be
recognized
by
it
and
from
this
sprung
the
complicated
science
of
heraldry
which
has
survived
with
all
its
intricate
detail
to
the
present
day
the
surface
of
the
shield
was
often
bowed
so
that
it
embraced
the
body
of
the
wearer
that
some
must
have
been
flat
we
may
suppose
from
the
fact
that
the
soldiers
in
the
bayeux
tapestry
are
represented
as
using
them
for
trays
to
carry
cups

the

the

was
attached
to
the

by
a
thong

the
transition
period
it
will
be
readily
understood
that
the
change
from
mail
to
plate
armour
was
not
brought
about
at
once
difficulty
of
manufacture
expense
and
conservatism
in
idea
all
retarded
the
innovation
some
progressive
knight
might
adopt
a
new
fashion
which
did
not
come
into
general
use
till
many
years
after
in
the
same
manner
that
from
force
of
circumstances
or
from
a
clinging
to
old
methods
we
find
an
detail
of
armour
like
the
coif
of
mail
shown
on
the
brass
of
sir
molineux
appearing
in
or
the
sleeved
hauberk
in
the
dresden
museum
which
was
worn
without
plate
defences
for
the
arms
by
herzog
august
at
the
battle
of
m√ºhlberg
in
acting
on
the
method
adopted
in
the
preceding
chapter
we
may
first
consider
the
materials
used
during
the
beginning
of
the
transition
period
and
afterwards
we
shall
show
how
those
materials
were
made
up
during
the
fourteenth
century
iron
leather
whalebone
and
quilted
fabrics
were
all
employed
for
defensive
purposes
the
illustration
from
the

shows
the
gambeson
still
worn
under
the
mail
and
the
legs
are
covered
in
one
instance
with
a

defence
a
second
figure
wears
what
appears
to
be
scale
armour
while
the
third
has
no
detail
shown
upon
the
legs
which
may
be
an
oversight
on
the
part
of
the
artist
or
may
suggest
that
plain
hose
were
worn
iron
was
used
for
the
mail
and
scale
armour
and
was
also
employed
in
making
a
pliable
defence
called
splinted
armour
which
at
a
later
period
became
the
brigandine
plate
ii
there
are
several
of
these
brigandines
to
be
found
in
the
armouries
of
england
and
europe
but
the
majority
of
them
date
about
the
middle
of
the
fifteenth
century
as
will
be
seen
in
the
illustration
the
brigandine
was
made
of
small
plates
of
iron
or
steel
overlapping
upwards
and
riveted
on
to
a
garment
of
silk
or
velvet
the
plates
were
worn
on
the
inside
in
most
cases
and
the
rivet
heads
which
showed
on
the
silk
or
velvet
face
were
often
gilded

producing
a
very
brilliant
effect

was
the

or
we
must
suppose
that
there
was
good
reason
for
thus
reinforcing
the
mail
defence
on
this
part
of
the
body
probably
this
was
due
to
the
fact
that
the
shield
became
shorter
at
this
period
and
also
because
the

of
the

but
in

they
are
invariably
shown

some

consider
that
they

solely

presumably
because

this
occurs
in

many
of
the
miniatures
that
it
must
be
taken
as
a
correct
presentment
of
this
detail
in
arming
it
may
be
however
that
as
this
manuscript
was
produced
in
the
year
it
recorded
a
later
method
of
using
the
ailette
which
disappears
about
the
middle
of
the
fourteenth
century
as
far
as
monumental
records

the
next
addition
of
plate

the

to
have

the

these
details
seem
to
be
advanced
in
some
points
and
are
shown
with
the
methods
of
attaching
them
to
the
wearer
the
rerebrace
is
strapped
over
the
mail
and
the
disc
at
the
bend
of
the
coude
or
is
held
in
place
by
aiguillettes
or
laces
called
at
a
later
period
the
poleynes
overlap
the
jambs
and
so
cover
the
junction
of
the
two
pieces
and
the
latter
are
held
to
the
leg
with
straps
the
solerets
are
among
the
earliest
examples
of
a
defence
of
laminated
plates
that
is
of
strips
of
metal
riveted
upon
leather
in
order
to
give
more
ease
of
movement
than
would
be
possible
with
a
solid
plate
the
vambrace
is
worn
under
the
sleeve
of
the
hauberk
and
not
as
in
the
preceding
example
over
the
mail
this
figure
is
especially
interesting
because
it
shows
the
different
garments
worn
with
the
armour
of
this
period
above
the

appears
the
tunic
over
this

the
hauberk
of
mail
in
this
instance
banded
mail
over
the
hauberk
are
shown
the
upper
pourpoint
a
quilted
garment
and
above
this
the
surcoat
or
as
this
variety
is
called
the
cyclas
the
difference
between
the
surcoat
proper
and
the
cyclas
is
that
the
former
is
of
even
length
all
round
while
the
latter
is
shorter
in
front
than
behind
see
also

the
coif

mail
has
now
given
place
to
the
camail

does
not
cover
the
head
but
is
attached
to

is
not
joined

we
find
the
mail
still
worn
on
the
legs
and
arms
but
on
the
latter
the
vambrace
and
the
coude
plate
seem
to
be
hinged
in
the
manner
adopted
during
the
period
of
full
armour
the
upper
part
of
the
leg
is
protected
by
studded
pourpointerie
which
was
frequently
employed
as
being
of
more
convenience
on
horseback
these
thigh
defences
were
called
the
cuisses

bascinet

shown
and
also
the
short

in
the
later

the
gauntlets
show
the
gadlings
or
which
are
a
marked
feature
of
this
period
and
the
whole
suit
is
richly
decorated
with
engraved
borders
some
writers
divide
the
transition
period
of
armour
into
and
this
however
seems
unnecessary
if
we
are
considering
only
the
development
of
defensive
armour
and
not
the
whole
question
of
costume
the
camail
is
so
marked
a
detail
of
the
knightly
equipment
that
it
may
reasonably
be
used
to
describe
the
fashion
in
armour
from
about
to
in
this
example
the
figure
is
clad
in
complete
plate
though
the
hauberk
is
worn
beneath
as
may
be
seen
at
the
lower
edge
of
the
jupon
and
also
in
the
de
or
portion
of
the
body
at
the
armpit
which
was
unprotected
by
plate
in
some
instances
this
vital
spot
was
protected
by
a
circular
oval
or
square
plate
attached
by
laces
which
modern
writers
call
the
rondel
but
which
viscount
dillon

a
most
interesting
article
proves
to
have
been

fig
the
effigy
of
the
black
prince
at
canterbury
is
a
good
example
of
the
armour
of
this
period
but
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
while
the
monumental
brasses
frequently
give
such
details
as
straps
buckles
this
effigy
shows
no
constructional
detail
whatever
we
find
that
in
spain
there
were
minute
regulations
drawn
up
as
to
the
manner
in
which
a
deceased
warrior
might
be
represented
on
his
tomb
the
details
of
sheathed
or
unsheathed
sword
helm
spurs
all
had
some
significant
reference
to
his
life
and
achievements
it
is
almost
superfluous
to
point
out
that
those
details
which
referred
to
the
knight
captivity
or
the
fact
that
he
had
been
vanquished
were
more
honoured
in
the
breach
than
in
the
observance

the

so
general
is
the

that
it
is
a
matter
of
some
conjecture
as
to
what

took

the
camail

which
we
have
before
referred

was
separate
from
the
hauberk
and
during
the
fourteenth

was
worn
over
the
jupon
it
was
attached
to
the
bascinet
by
vervelles
or
staples
which
fitted
into

in

a

passed
through
these

is

how
the

we

the

differs
but
little
from
those
of
the
late
thirteenth

which
were

the
shape
was
either
of
the
order
or
a
cylinder
surmounted
by
a
truncated

this
seems
to
suggest
that
the

was
of
some
other
material
than
steel
possibly
leather
it
is
rare
to
come
across
constructional
detail
in
illuminations
but
the
illustration

from
a
french

of

shows
a
method
of
attaching

the
most
popular
of
the
light
helmets
at
this
period
was
the
bascinet
it
appears
on
nearly
every
monumental
brass
that
depicts
a
military
figure
and
is
an
essential
part
of
that
style
of
equipment
known
as
the
the
later
form
of
bascinet
has
a
movable
visor
which
is
known
among
armour
collectors
as
the
bascinet
plate
v
sometimes
the
hinge
is
at
the
top
and
sometimes
as
in
no

plate

is

and
in
the

referred
to

given

this
shows
that
while
some
helmets
were
of
polished
metal
others
were
covered
with
leather
and
indeed
silk
and
velvet
as
fancy
dictated
frequent
references
to
these
for
helmets
occur
in
inventories
and
wills
the
helmet
and
other
portions
of
the
suit
of
plate
armour
were
sometimes
tinned
to
prevent
rust
as
is
shown
in
one
of
the
dover
castle
inventories
of
basynetz
tinez
sometimes
in
the
case
of
royalty
or
princes
of
rank
the
bascinet
was
encircled
with
a
fillet
or
crown
of
gold
and
gems

the

the
orle
or
wreath
worn
round
the
bascinet
is
sometimes
shown
as
on
fig
of
a
decorative
nature
it
is
supposed
by
some
writers
to
have
been
devised
to
take
the
pressure
of
the
great
helm
from
the
head
for
the
helm
was
often
worn
as
in
the
preceding
century
over
a
lighter
headpiece
from
the
usual
position
of
the
orle
however
and
from
the
fact
that
it
is
invariably
shown
highly
decorated
and
jewelled
this
explanation
can
hardly
hold
good
for
a
padding
worn
as
shown
in
the
illustration
would
not
be
of
much
service
in
keeping
off
the
pressure
of
the
helm
and
of
course
the
jewelled
decoration
would
be
destroyed
at
once
another
theory
is
that
the
orle
was
made
by
wrapping
the
lambrequin
or
mantling
which
hung
from
the
back
of
the
helmet
and
which
is
still
used
in
heraldic
drawings
much
in
the
same
manner
as
the
modern

is
worn
in

the
wearing
of
armour
and
its
constructional
details
before
proceeding
to
examine
the
suit
of
full
plate
with
all
its
interesting
details
and
differences
as
exemplified
in
the
various
armouries
of
england
and
europe
it
will
be
well
to
make
clear
the
main
principles
which
governed
the
manufacture
of
such
armour
we
should
remember
that
the
whole
history
of
our
subject
is
one
long
struggle
of
defensive
equipment
against
offensive
weapons
this
is
brought
out
clearly
at
the
present
day
in
the
navy
where
the
contest
between
gun
and
is
the
dominant
factor
in
naval
construction
as
the
weapons
of
the
middle
ages
became
more
serviceable
the
armour
was
increased
in
weight
the
longbow
and
the
crossbow
marked
distinct
periods
in
the
development
of
defensive
armour
for
so
important
a
factor
did
these
weapons
become
especially
the
latter
that
they
were
used
for
testing
the
temper
of
the
metal
large
or
small
weapons
being
used
as
occasion
demanded
those
writers
who
are
prone
to
generalize
upon
such
subjects
tell
us
that
the
invention
of
gunpowder
sounded
the
knell
of
defensive
armour
but
this
is
by
no
means
accurate
for
guns
were
used
in
sieges
as
early
as
and
as
we
shall
find
farther
on
in
this
chapter
the
armour
of
the
late
sixteenth
century
was
proved
by
pistol
shot
the
result
of
the
improvement
of
firearms
was
that
for
many
years
armour
became
heavier
and
thicker
till
the
musket
was
perfected
and
then
it
was
found
that
even
steel
would
not
resist
the
impact
of
a
bullet
it
is
a
safe
assertion
to
make
that
a
full
suit
of
plate
armour
at
its
finest
period
the
fifteenth
century
is
the
most
perfect
work
of
craftsmanship
that
exists
illustration
fig
illustration
fig
maximilian
breastplate
and
taces
illustration
fig
coude
or
this
assertion
is
not
made
without
fully
considering
the
real
value
of
such
work
which
must
fulfil
all
those
essentials
without
which
no
true
work
of
craftsmanship
can
have
any
merit
the
first
of
these
is
that
the
work
should
fulfil
its
object
in
the
best
possible
manner
secondly
that
it
should
be
convenient
and
simple
in
use
thirdly
that
it
should
proclaim
its
material
and
fourthly
and
this
is
by
no
means
the
least
important
that
any
decoration
should
be
subservient
to
its
purpose
to
take
our
axioms
in
the
order
given
it
may
appear
to
the
casual
student
that
if
armour
were
sufficiently
thick
it
would
naturally
fulfil
its
primary
reason
for
existence
but
we
find
on
careful
examination
of
plate
armour
that
there
are
other
considerations
which
are
of
equal
if
not
greater
importance
of
these
the
most
noticeable
is
the
surface
it
is
somewhat
difficult
to
exemplify
this
by
a
though
it
is
easy
to
do
so
with
an
actual
example
referring
to
the
maximilian
breastplate
fig
we
find
that
a
lance
the
thrusting
weapon
much
favoured
in
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
would
on
striking
the
breast
be
deflected
along
the
grooved
channel
nearest
to
the
point
of
impact
till
it
reached
the
raised
edge
either
at
the
top
or
at
the
sides
when
it
would
be
conducted
safely
off
the
body
of
the
wearer
the
same
surface
is
to
be
noticed
on
all
helms
and
helmets
after
the
twelfth
century
the
rounded
surfaces
giving
no
sure
hold
for
cutting
or
thrusting
weapons
the
coude
fig
shows
this
same
glancing
surface
used
to
protect
the
elbow
and
again
the
plate
on
the
outside
of
the
knee
effects
the
same
result

so
constructed
that
the

glance
off
them
when
the

is
in
the
proper

is
bent
forward
at
such
an
angle
that
the
eyes
come
on
a
level

inch
thick
for
in
the
bending
position
adopted
by
the
wearer
this
portion
of
the
helm
would
be
most
exposed
to
the
lance

less
than
half

thickness

helm

one
of
the
heaviest
in
existence

and
except
in
the
case
of

where
the
overlapping
from
necessity
of

must
be
in
an
inverse
direction

chance

a

penetrating

reduced

two
facts
cited
by
him
prove
conclusively
that

additional

made
in

held
on

yards

cotton
at

lining

the

need
lining

it
did
not
even
touch
the

we
may
dismiss
at
once
and
that
the
lining
should
be
on
the
outside
is
of
course
absurd
as
far
as
can
be
gathered
from
recent
research
the
is
a
reinforcing
piece
for
the
right
elbow
used
for
jousting
it
was
lined
to
protect
the
ordinary
arm
defence
underneath
from
being
scratched
and
also
to
lessen
the
shock
to
the
wearer
if
it
were
struck
it
is
to
be
hoped
from
this
reiteration
of
viscount
dillon

that
at
any
rate
one
of
the
many
errors
of

may
be

with
regard
to
the
thickness
of
plate
armour
we
should
remember
that
it
was
forged
from
the
solid
ingot
and
was
not
rolled
in
sheets
as
is
the
material
of
from
which
so
many
forgeries
are
manufactured
the
armourer
was
therefore
able
to
graduate
the
thickness
of
his
material
increasing
it
where
it
was
most
needed
and
lessening
it
in
those
parts
which
were
less
exposed
with
regard
to
the
proving
of

an
article
in

also
by

of
great
interest
as
showing
the
indifferent
skill
of
the
english
ironsmiths
of
the
sixteenth
century
in
a
discussion
arose
as
to
the
quality
of
the
english
iron
found
in
shropshire

compared
to
the
iron
which
came

of
equal
make
and
weight
two
pistol
charges
of
equal
power
were
fired
at
the
test

with
the
result
that
the
foreign
armour
was
only
slightly
dented
while
the
english
plate
was
pierced
completely
and
the

on
which
it
rested
was

no
excuse
need
be
offered
for
thus
borrowing
from
papers
by
viscount
dillon
and
other
writers
in
and
the
for
these
publications
are
not
always
at
hand
to
those
interested
in
the
subject
of
armour
and
equipments
they
are
however
indispensable
for
careful
study
for
they
contain
reports
of
the
most
recent
discoveries
and
investigations
of
the
subject
and
are
written
for
the
most
part
by
men
whose
expert
knowledge
is
at

extensive
and
precise

maximilian

another
detail
of
importance
in
connexion
with
the
protective
power
of
armour
occurs
in
the
great
jousting
helms
which
invariably
present
a
smooth
surface
on
the
left
side
even
when
there
may
be
some
opening
for
ventilation
or
other
purposes
on
the
right
the
reason
for
this
was
that
the
jouster
always
passed
left
arm
to
left
arm
with
the
lance
pointed
across
the
horse
neck
it
was
therefore
important
that
there
should
be
no
projection
or
opening
on
the
left
side
of
the
helm
in
which
the
could
possibly
be
caught
we
next
turn
our
attention
to
convenience
in
use
under
this
head
the
armourer
had
to
consider
that
the
human
body
makes
certain
movements
of
the
limbs
for
walking
and
riding
or
fighting
with
arm
and
hand
he
had
so
to
construct
the
different
portions
of
the
suit
that
they
should
allow
of
all
these
movements
without
hindrance
and
at
the
same
time
he
had
to
endeavour
to
protect
the
body
and
limbs
while
the
movements
were
taking
place
the
arrangements
for
pivoting
and
need
scarcely
be
detailed
for
it
will
be
seen
by
a
glance
at
any
suit
of
plate
armour
how
the
cuisse
and
jamb
are
pivoted
on
to
the
genouilli√®re
and
move
with
the
leg
to
a
straight
or
bent
position
without
allowing
these
plates
to
escape
from
under
the
genouilli√®re
the
coude
is
sometimes
pivoted
in
the
same
manner
but
more
often
it
is
rigid
and
of
such
circumference
that
the
arm
can
bend
within
it
and
yet
be
very
adequately
protected
in
the
overlapping
lames
or
strips
of
metal
which
give
ease
of
movement
to
the
upper
arm
the
hands
the
waist
and
the
foot
we
find
that
much
careful
work
and
calculation
was
needed
to
ensure
comfort
to
the
wearer
on
the
foot
the
toepiece
and
four
or
more
arches
of
metal
overlap
upwards
on
to
a
broader
arch
while
above
this
three
or
more
arches
overlap
downwards
thus
allowing
the
and
ankle
to
be
bent
at
the
same
time
fig
in
a
suit
in
the
tower
made
for
prince
henry
son
of
james
i
all
the
arches
of
the
soleret
overlap
downwards
this
points
to
a
certain
decadence
in
the
craftsmanship
of
the
armourer
of
the
period
though
the
excuse
might
be
offered
for
him
that
the
suit
was
intended
only
for
use
on
horseback
there
are
generally
one
two
or
more
of
these
movable
lames
joining
the
genouilli√®re
to
the
jamb
and
above
this
the
cuisse

the
genouilli√®re

give
greater
flexibility

hinged

and
closed

and

or
with
locking
hook
or
bolt
on

this
of
course
is
to
ensure
greater
protection
to
these
fastenings
especially
on
horseback
higher
up
again
we
get
the
tuilles
or
taces
which
from
the
fact
that
to
adapt
themselves
to
the
human
form
they
must
narrow

the
waist
and
spread
out

upwards
from
the
taces

hung
the
tassets
with
strap
and
buckle
which
give
increased
protection
to
the
upper
leg
and
yet
are
not
in
any
way
rigid
when
the
tassets
are
made
of
more
than
one
plate
they
are
attached
to
each
other
by
a
most
ingenious
arrangement
of
straps
and
sliding
rivets
on
the
inner
edge
of
each
plate
the
rivets
are
attached
to
a
strap
on
the
under
side
but
the
outer
edge
requiring
more
compression
of
the
lames
together
is
furnished
with
rivets
fixed
firmly
in
the
uppermost
plate
and
working
loose
in
a
slot
in
the
back
plate
thus
allowing
an
expansion
or
contraction
of
half
an
inch
or
more
to
each
lame
it
is
somewhat
difficult
to
explain
this
ingenious
arrangement
in
words
but
fig

show
how
the
straps
and
rivets
are
set
when
the
tassets
were
discarded

often
laminated
with

a
rule

there
are
instances
of
these

overlapping
upwards
they
are
joined
in
the

way
as
the
laminated
tassets
by
a
riveted
strap
on
the
inner
side
and
by
sliding
rivets
at
the
back
thus
giving
the
arm
freedom
of
movement
forwards
in
the
direction
most
needed
but
less
freedom
towards
the
back
these
sliding
rivets
working
in
slots
have
come
to
be
called
rivets

the
fact
that

the
wearing

a
man
could
not
wear

friction

was
too
great
in
spite
of
the
excellence
of
workmanship
of
the
armourer
any
thin
substance
was
bound
to
be
torn
so
a
strong
fabric
was
chosen
which
is
called
in
contemporary
records
fustian
whether
it
at
all
resembled
the
modern
fabric
of
that
name
it
is
difficult

the

manuscript
in
the
possession
of
lord
hastings
the
knight
is
first
dressed
in
a
doublet
of
fustian
lined
with
satin
which
is
cut
with
holes
for
ventilation
this
satin
was
to
keep
the
roughness
of
the
fustian
from
the
wearer
body
for
he
wore
no
shirt
under
it
the
doublet
was
provided
with
gussets
of
mail
or
vuyders
attached
under
the
armpit
and
at
the
bend
of
the
elbow
by
arming
points
or
laces
these
mail
gussets
were
to
protect
the
parts
not
covered
by
the
plate
armour
the
of
an
italian
nobleman
by
moroni
in
the
national
gallery
shows
the
figure
dressed
in
this
arming
doublet
a
pair
of
thick
worsted
hose
were
worn
and
shoes
of
stout
leather
it
must
be
noticed
here
that
the
soleret
or
sabaton
as
it
is
sometimes
called
covered
only
the
top
of
the
foot
and
had
understraps
which
kept
it
to
the
sole
of
the
shoe
first
the
sabatons
were
put
on
then
the
jambs
genouilli√®re
and
cuisses
then
the
skirt
or
breech
of
mail
round
the
waist
this
is
sometimes
known
as
the
brayette
then
the
backplates
were
buckled
on
with
the
accompanying
taces
tassets
and
or
plates
to
protect
the
loins
after
this
the
arm
defences
and
if
worn
over
the
breastpiece
the
gorget
and
finally
the
helmet
completed
the
equipment
the
sword
was
buckled
on
the
left
side
and
the
dagger
on
the
right
the
armour
for
jousts
and
tourneys
was
much
heavier
than
the
hosting
or
war
harness
from
the
fact
which
has
been
previously
noticed
that
the
combatants
passed
each
other
on
the
left
this
side
of
the
armour
was
reinforced
to
such
a
degree
that
in
time
it
presented
a
totally
different
appearance
from
the
right
side
see
plate
vii
the
weight
of
jousting
armour
was
so
great
that
it
was
impossible
for
the
wearer
to
mount
without
assistance
de
pluvinel
in
his
gives
an
imaginary
conversation
between
himself
and
the
king
louis
xiv
as
follows
seems
to
me
that
such
a
man
would
have
difficulty
in
getting
on
his
horse
and
being
on
to
help
himself
would
be
very
difficult
but
with
this
arming
the
matter
has
been
provided
for
in
this
manner
at
triumphs
and
tourneys
there
ought
to
be
at
the
two
ends
of
the
lists
a
small
scaffold
the
height
of
a
stirrup
on
which
two
or
three
persons
can
stand
that
is
to
say
the
knight
an
armourer
to
arm
him
and
one
other
to
help
him
the
knight
being
armed
and
the
horse
brought
close
to
the
stand
he
easily
mounts
him
reference
has
been
made
to
the
fact
that
modern
writers
call
the
sliding
rivet
the
rivet
whenever
mentioned
in
inventories
and
documents
the
almain
rivet
stands
for
a
suit
of
light

the
of
course
refers
to
the
and
backplates
the
word
alman
almaine
or
almain
shows
that
the
invention
of
this
light
armour
and
the
sliding
rivets
which
were
used
in
its
construction
came
from
germany
that
the
wearing
of
armour
caused
grave
inconvenience
to
some
while
to
others
it
seems
to
have
been
no
hindrance
at
all
we
may
gather
from
the
following
historical
incidents
in
king
louis
of
hungary
fleeing
from
the
battle
of
mohacz
was
drowned
while
crossing
the
danube
because
of
the
weight
of
his
armour
on
the
other
hand
we
find
that
robert
de
vere
earl
of
oxford
when
forced
to
fly
at
the
battle
of
radcot
bridge
escaped
easily
by
swimming
the
river
to
safety
in
full
armour
we
should
remember
that
the
weight
of
plate
armour
was
less
felt
than
that
of
mail
because
the
former
was
distributed
over
the
whole
body
and
limbs
while
the
latter
hung
from
the
shoulders
and
waist
alone
king
henry

says
i
could
win
a
lady
at
leapfrog
or
by
vaulting
into
my
saddle
with
my

on
my
back
which
seems
to
imply
that
this
feat
was
at
any
rate
a
possibility

safely
consign
sir

scott
description
of
the
feasting
knights
to
the
realms
of
poetic
licence
for
he
writes
they
carved
at
the
meal
with
gloves
of
steel
and
drank
the
red
wine
through
their
helmets
barred
now
if
there
were
two
portions
of
the
knight
equipment
which
would
be
put
off
at
the
first
opportunity
and
which
could
be
assumed
the
most
rapidly
they
were
the
helmet
and
gauntlets
to
drink
through
a
visored
helmet
is
a
practical
impossibility
the
word
beavor
which
is
generally
derived
from
the
italian
to
drink
has
been
considered
by
baron
de
cosson
with
far
more
probability
to
be
derived
from
the
old
french
originally

the
cleaning
of
armour
is
frequently
alluded
to
in
inventories

mentioned
barrelle

rollandis
was
rolled
in
barrels
with
sand
and
vinegar
to
clean
it
just
as
inversely
barrels
are
cleaned
in
the
country
at
the
present
day
by
rolling
chains
in
them
the
mending
and
cleaning
of
armour
was
of
the
first
importance
and
the
travelling
knight
took
with
him
an
armourer
who
was
provided
with
such
things
as
for
dressing
my
harness
a
thousand

nayles

a

and
all
other

belonginge
to
an
armorer
we
can
gather
but
little
of
the
methods
of
the
armourers
in
their
work
it
was
so
important
a
craft
that
its
operations
were
most
jealously
guarded
and
the
term
which
was
applied
to
the
trade
gilds
of
the
middle
ages
can
be
most
fittingly
given
to
that
of

interesting

famous
armourer
in
the
text
the
is
described
as
being
anxious
to
make
use
of
the
art
but
the
young
king
replies
me
according
to
my
own
taste
for
it
is
i
not
you
who
have
to
take
part
in
the
tournament
what
this
forbidden
art
may
have
been
we
have
no
suggestion
given
us
it
seems
from
this
account
to
be
more
than
likely
that
seusenhofer
possessed
some
mechanical
means
for
stamping
out
armour
plate
for
it
goes
on
to
say
this
young
king
invented
a
new
art
for
warriors
armour
so
that
in
the
workshop
front
pieces
and
hinder
pieces
were
made
at

the

na√Øve
treatment

can
hardly
be

to
be

were
more
probably

to
the
different
patrons
of

entirely

of
the

can
do
no
more
than
mention
the

in

like
baron
de
cosson
and
herr
boeheim
have
in
the
various
archaeological
journals
of
england
and
germany
brought
to
light
many
interesting
facts
about
these
armourers
but
the
confines
of
this
handbook
do
not
admit
of
detailed
quotation
nor
indeed
is
it
necessary
to
study
these
details
till
the
primary
interest
in
defensive
armour
has
been
aroused
when
this
has
been
achieved
the
student

certainly
leave
no

that
which

the
best
periods
does
this
to
the
full
it
is
only
under
the
blighting
influence
of
the
renaissance

we
find
metal
so
worked
that
it
resembles
woven
fabrics

worse
still

it
is
so
very
rare
to
be
able
to
fix
the
date
of
a
suit
of
armour
at
a
particular
year
that
we
are
forced
in
dividing
our
periods
of
defensive
armour
with
any
degree
of
minuteness
to
have
recourse
to
the
records
existing
in
monumental
effigies
the
earliest
brasses
which
show
the
whole
suit
of
plate
without
camail
or
jupon
are
those
of
one
of
the
family
at
spilsby
lincolnshire
and
of
sir
john
wylcotes
at
great
tew
both
dated
in
these
brasses
we
find
that
the
camail
has
become
the
standard
of
mail
or
collarette
worn
under
the
gorget
of
plate
the
hauberk
is
seen
beneath
the
taces
and
in
the
former
brass
in
the
de

or
unprotected
part
at
the
junction
of
arm
and
body
in
the
great
tew
brass
this
part
is
protected
by
oval
plates
which
as
we
have
noticed
in
a
preceding
chapter
are
called
motons
or
besagues
hewitt
does
not
seem
to
have
come
across
these
terms
in
the
course
of
his
very
minute
investigations
but
calls
them
croissants
or
gouchets
he
quotes
a
passage
from
mathieu
de
coucy
of
charles
which
runs
du

at
au

de
son
harnois
par

et

gouchet
haines
in
his
mentions
the
moton
but
assigns
this
name
to
a
piece
of
plate
rarely
met
with
shaped
to
fit
under
the
right
armpit
only
with
the
disappearance
of
the
jupon
we
see
the
body
defence
exposed
to
view
the
breastplate
is
globular
in
form
and
below
the
waist
we
see
the
taces
or
laminated
strips
of
plate
overlapping
each
other
which
at
this
early
period
were
attached
to
a
leather
lining
as
we
have
seen
in
the
chapter
on
the
construction
of
armour
at
a
later
period
these
taces
were
held
together
by
sliding
rivets
which
allowed
a
certain
amount
of
vertical
play
plate
armour
during
the
earlier
years
of
the
fifteenth
century
was
naturally
in
a
somewhat
experimental
state
and
we
find
frequent
examples
of
the
old
forms
and
fashions
in
contemporary
representations
about
the
year
appears
a
distinct
style
called
which
of
all
types
of
defensive
armour
is
perhaps
the
most
graceful
this
term
is
as
inappropriate
in
the
relation
which
it
bore
to
armour
as
to
architecture
but
its
use
is
so
general
that
we
must
perforce
adopt
it
for
want
of
a
better
the
salient
points
of
gothic
armour
are
the
sweeping
lines
embossed
on
its
surfaces
plate

the
cuirass
is
generally
made
in
two
pieces
an
upper
and
a
lower
which
allows
more
freedom
for
the
body
from
the
taces
are
hung
tassets
ending
in
a
point
towards
the
lower
edge
the
later
form
of
gothic
breastplate
is
longer
and
the
taces
fewer
in
number
armour
was
so
frequently
remade
to
suit
later
fashions
or
from
lack
of
antiquarian
interest
so
often
destroyed
that
there
is
little
of
this
gothic
armour
existing
in
england
except
those
suits
which
have
been
acquired
from
the
continent
by
private
collectors
or
public
museums
almost
all
of
them
are
incomplete
or
if
complete
have
been
restored
particularly
the
leg
armour
at
a
recent
date
perhaps
the
finest
example
of
this
style
is
to
be
found
on
the
effigy
in
mary
church
warwick
space
will
not
allow
of
a
full
account
of
the
documents
connected
with
the
making
of
this
magnificent
figure
which
was
executed
by
will
austin
a
and
bartholomew
lambespring
a
goldsmith
in
fifteen
years
after
the
death
of
the
earl
all
these
interesting
details
are
given
very
fully
in
blore
to
students
of
the
constructional
side
of
armour
this
monument
is
particularly
valuable
because
all
the
fastenings
rivets
and
straps
are
conscientiously
portrayed
not
only
on
the
front
but
also
at
the
back
charles
stothard
the
antiquary
when
making
drawings
of
the
figure
for
his
work
on
turned
it
over
and
discovered
this
example
of
the
care
and
technical
ability
of
the
makers
the
breastplate
is
short
and
consequently
the
taces
are
more
numerous
than
when
the
breastplate
is
longer
they
consist
of
five
lames
from
the
taces
hang
four
tassets
two
bluntly
pointed
in
front
and
two
much
shorter
and
more
sharply
pointed
over
the
the
taces
are
hinged
at
the
side
for
convenience
in
putting
on
and
off
the
coudes
are
large
and
of
the
type
and
the
sollerets
are
of
normal
length
in
many
of
the
gothic
suits
these
sollerets
following
the
custom
in
civil
dress
were
extravagantly
long
and
pointed
this
form
is
called
la
poulaine
while
the
shorter
kind
are
known
as
some
writers
are
apt
to
confuse
this
term
with
the
used
in
the
earlier
days
of
the
transition
period
it
is
needless
to
point
out
that
they
are
quite
distinct
baron
de
cosson
has
put
forward
a
most
interesting
theory
in
connexion
with
this
effigy
he
finds
a
close
resemblance
between
the
armour
here
portrayed
and
that
shown
in
the
picture
of
george
by
mantegna
in
the
accademia
at
venice
the
earl
of
warwick
who
is
represented
on
this
monument
is
known
to
have
been
at
milan
in
his
youth
and
to
have
taken
part
in
tournaments
at
verona
so
it
is
more
than
probable
that
he
ordered
his
armour
from
the
milanese
armourers
of
whom
the
famous
missaglia
family
were
the
chief
craftsmen
and
who
made
some
fine
suits
of
this
gothic
style
illustration

the
next
distinctive
style
to
be
noticed
is
called
the
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
this
new
design
was
evolved
from
the
gothic
though
of
necessity
there
must
be
a
certain
similarity
between
them
at
least
in
constructional
detail
it
is
more
likely
when
we
consider
the
individuality
of
the
young
maximilian
especially
as
recorded
in
hans
burgkmair
and
his
interest
in
every
art
craft
and
trade
that
it
was
a
fashion
made
so
to
speak
to
order
the
maximilian
period
of
armour
may
be
said
to
last
from
about

it
is
at
this
period
of
the
history
of
defensive
armour
that
we
first
find
traces
of
that
decadence
which
later
on
permeated
every
art
and
craft
with
its
pernicious
poison
it
is
to
be
found
in
the
imitating
of
fabrics
and
also
of
the
human
face
in
metal
there
exist
suits
of
plate
in
many
museums
both
in
england
and
on
the
continent
in
which
the
puffings
and
slashings
of
the
civilian
attire
are
closely
copied
in
embossed
metal
entirely
destroying
the
important
glancing
surfaces
on
which
we
have
laid
such
stress
it
is
alleged
that
this
fashion
in
civilian
dress
was
intended
to
suggest
by
the
cutting
of
the
material
to
show
an
undergarment
beneath
that
the
wearer
was
a
fighting
man
who
had
seen
rough
service
if
this
be
the
case
it
is
the
more
reprehensible
that
metal
should
be
treated
in
a
similar
manner
for
hard
usage
would
dent
but
it
would
not

a
portion
of
one
of
these
debased
suits
is
drawn
on
fig
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
all
armour
at
this
period
was
fluted
there
was
still
a
good
deal
which
had
a
plain
surface
and
this
plain
armour
continued
to
be
used
after
the
maximilian
armour
had
been
given
up
it
may
have
been
that
the
evil
genius
of
the
renaissance
pointed
to
the
plain
surfaces
as
excellent
fields
for
the
skill
of
the
decorator
a
field
which
the
flutings
of
the
maximilian
armour
could
not
offer
at
first
this
decoration
was
confined
to
engraved
borders
or
if
the
design
covered
the
whole
suit
it
was
so
lightly
engraved
that
the
smooth
surface
was
in
no
way
impaired
though
perhaps
some
of
the
dignified
simplicity
of
the
plain
metal
was
lost
an
instance
of
this
proper
application
of
ornament
to
armour
is
to
be
found
in
the
suit
in
the
tower
plate
vi
made
to
the
order
of
the
emperor
maximilian
for
henry
viii
it
is
one
of
the
finest
suits
of
this
period
in
existence
the
ornament
is
lightly
engraved
all
over
it
and
includes
representations
of
the
legends
of
george
and
barbara
instead
of
taces
and
tassets
the
lower
part
of
the
body
and
the
thighs
are
protected
by
steel
bases
made
in
folds
to
imitate
the
skirts
worn
in
civilian
dress
it
will
be
remembered
that
in
the
preceding
chapter
a
conversation
between
seusenhofer
and
the
young
maximilian
was
quoted
and
when
we
study
this
suit
carefully
we
feel
that
the
young
king
did
wisely
in
the
choice
of
his
the
craftsman
poin√ßon
or
mark
is
to
be
found
at
the
back
of
the
helmet
if
space
but
permitted
we
might
devote
many
pages
to
the
work
of
the
great
as
exemplified
in
the
armouries
of
madrid
and
vienna
it
is
difficult
at
this
period
of
history
to
generalize
at
all
satisfactorily
each
suit
is
in
many
ways
distinct
from
its
neighbour
just
as
the
character
and
personality
of
the
wearers
differed
the
young
words
to
seusenhofer
me
according
to
my
own
taste
is
true
of
every
suit
that
we
examine
for
it
is
evident
that
each
man
had
his
own
favourite
fashion
or
from
physical
necessity
was
provided
with
some
special
variation
from
the
usual
form
an
instance
of
this
may
be
noted
in
the
barendyne
helm
at
haseley
church
near
thame
in
which
an
extra
plate
has
been
added
at
the
lower
edge
of
the
helm
to
suit
the
length
of
neck
of
the
last
wearer
as
the
experience
of
the
armourer
increased
and
as
the
science
of
war
developed
the
armed
man
trusted
more
to
the
fixed
defences
of
his
person
than
to
the
more
primitive
protection
of
the
movable
shield
in
the
and
also
in
war
the
mounted
man
endeavoured
to
present
his
left
side
to
his
adversary
on
consideration
the
reason
for
this
will
be
plain
for
the
right
arm
was
required
to
be
free
and
as
far
as
possible
unhampered
by
heavy
armour
but
the
left
arm
held
at
rest
at
the
bridle
could
be
covered
with
as
heavy
defences
as
the
wearer
might
choose
this
form
of
unequal
arming
is
well
shown
on
the
frontispiece
the
left
shoulder
wears
a
large
pauldron
with
a
high
and
the
elbow
wears
the
which
we
have
noticed
in
detail
in
the
preceding
chapter
the
leg
armour
in
this
suit
should
be
noticed
for
it
is
extremely
fine
and
graceful
in
line
and
yet
proclaims
its
material
the
suit
of
henry
viii
plate
vi
is
a
good
specimen
of
armour
of
the
maximilian
period
but
without
the
flutings
which
generally
distinguish
this
style
of
plate
the
are
high
and
the
large
coudes
show
the
glancing
surface
plainly
this
detail
also
is
shown
on
the
fan
plates
at
the
genouilli√®res
which
in
the
tower
inventories
are
called
by
the
more
english
term
the
of
the
rider
wears
the
manifer
those
writers
who
still
follow
blindly
the
incorrect
nomenclature
of
meyrick
give
the
name
mainfaire
or
manefer
to
the
crinet
or
neck
defence
of
the
horse
how
this
absurd
play
upon
words
can
ever
have
been
taken
seriously
passes
understanding
the
manifer
is
solely
the
rigid
iron
gauntlet
for
the
where
no
sudden
or
complicated
movement
of
the
wrist
or
fingers
was
needed
another
instance
of
the
difference
in
arming
the
two
sides
of
the
body
this
difference
of
arming
is
more
noticeable
in
the
jousting
armour
for
in
military
sports
especially
during
the
sixteenth
century
the
object
of
the
contestants
was
to
score
points
rather
than
to
injure
each
other
we
find
therefore
such
pieces
as
the
and
with
it
the
volant
piece
the
the
poldermitton
so
called
from
its
likeness
to
the
de
mouton
and
worn
over
the
bend
of
the
right
arm
and
the
various
reinforcing
breastplates
which
were
screwed
on
to
the
left
side
of
the
tilting
suit
to
offer
a
more
rigid
defence
and
also
to
present
additional
glancing
surface
to
the
in
some
varieties
of
joust
a
small
wooden
shield
was
fastened
to
the
left
breast
and
when
this
was
the
case
the
heavy
pauldron
was
dispensed
with
the
large
vamplate

sufficiently
protected

this
form
of
arming

the
great

is
firmly
screwed
to
the
back
and
breast
the
two
holes
on
the
left
side
of
the
breastplate
are
for
the
attachment
of
the
shield
the
rigid
covers

at
its

lodged
under

at
the
back
the
legs
in
this
variety
of
joust
were
not
armed
for
the
object
of
the
jousters
was
to
unhorse
each
other
and
it
was
necessary
to
have
perfect
freedom
in
gripping
the
horse
sides
sometimes
a
great
plate
of
metal
curved
to
cover
the
leg
was
worn
to
protect
the
wearer
from
the
shock
of
impact
this
was
called
the
dilge
or
tilting
cuisse
which
is
shown
on
plate
viii
behind
the
figure
of
count
sigismond
and
also
on

the
saddle
also
was
used
for
this
end
there
is
one
of
these
saddles
in
the
tower
which
measures
nearly
feet
in
height
behind
the
are
two
rings
which
encircled
the
legs
it
is
needless
to
point
out
that
in
this
form
of
joust
the
object
was
to
break
lances
and
not
to
unhorse
for
if
the
latter
were
intended
the
rider
stood
a
good
chance
of
breaking
his
legs
owing
to
his
rigid
position
in
the
saddle
the
tonlet
suit
fig
was
used
solely
for
fighting
on

the
skirt
of

was
so
constructed
with
the
sliding
rivets
or
straps
which
have
been
before
referred
to
that
it
could
be
pulled
up
and
down
sometimes
the
lower
lame
could
be
taken
off
altogether
when
fighting
with
axes
or
swords
in
the
lists
this
plate
skirt
presented
a
glancing
surface
to
the
weapon
and
protected
the
legs
the
tonlet
is
variously
called
by
writers
upon
armour
bases
lamboys
or
jamboys
of
the
two
latter
terms
jamboys
is
the
more
correct
the
bases
were
originally
the

in

in

gradually
decrease
the

which
mark
this

were
in
no
way
suited
for
any
practical
purpose
and
were
used
only
for
parades
extended
campaigns
and
long
marches
necessitated
lighter

and
we
find
in
contemporary
records
instances
not
only
of
the
discarding
their
armour
owing
to
its
inconvenience
but
also
of
commanders
ordering
them
to
lighten

preparation
of

not
a

esteemed

early
as

we
find
that
at
the
battle
of
auray
sir
hugh
calverley
ordered
his
men
to
take
off
their
cuisses
that
they
might
move
more
rapidly
in
the
armour
of
the
late
sixteenth
century
one
of
the
chief
points
of
difference
from
the
former
fashions
is
to
be
found
in
the
cuisses
whereas
these
defences
were
formerly
made
of
one
or
possibly
two
plates
we
now
find
them
laminated
from
waist
to
knee
and
joined
by
the
strap

have
noted

after
the
fourteenth
century
the
great
helm
was

seldom
used
for
war
but
for
jousting
it
was
still
retained
and
as
this
form
of
military
sport
was
practised
more
scientifically
so
the
weight
and
shape
of
the
helm
were
made
to
suit
the
necessary
conditions

of
these

that
they
could
only
be

for
the

were
put
off

the
details
of
their
construction
have
been
noticed
in
chapter
iii
on
referring
to
plate
v
it
will
be
seen
that
the
bascinet
was
the
precursor
of
the
salade
which
may
be
considered
the
typical
headpiece
of
the
fifteenth
century
the
rear
peak
of
the
bascinet
is
prolonged
over
the
neck
and
in
a
later
form
of
german
origin
the
peak
is
hinged
to
allow
the
wearer
to
throw
back
his
head

ease
the

is
sometimes
cut
in

more
often
it

in
a
pivoted
visor
which
could
be
thrown

the
beavor
is
generally
a
separate
piece
strapped
round
the
neck
or
in
tilting
bolted
to
the
breastplate
some
writers
call
this
the

this
name
should
rather
be
applied
to
the
tilting
breastplate
which
also
protected
the
lower
portion
of
the

shakespeare
uses
the
term
beavor
very
loosely
and
frequently
means
by
it
the
whole
helmet
the
german

salade
so
called
from
its
form
seems
to
have
been
evolved
from

made

are
several
of
these
covered
salades

sometimes
the
salade
was
painted
as
we
see
in
an
example
in
the

the
armet

close
helmet
followed
the
salade
and
is
mentioned
by
oliver

early

be
a
corruption
of
the
diminutive
of
the
great
helm
of
the
fourteenth
century
whereas
the
salade
is
in
form
a
defence
the
armet
fits
the

before

against

we

place
the
fact
that
in

the

are
all
shown
wearing
armets

still
wear
the

the
armet
on
the
seusenhofer
suit
in
the
tower
which
has
been
noticed
in
this
chapter
is
a
very
perfect
example
of
this
style
of
headpiece
the
burgonet
is
an
open
helmet
and
as
the
name
implies
of
burgundian
origin
to
those
students
who
consult
meyrick
it
is
advisable
to
give
a
word
of
warning
as
to
this
author
theory
of
the
burgonet
he
assumes
that
it
is
a
variety
of
the
armet
but
with
a
grooved
collar
which
fitted
over
the
gorget
his
authority
for
this
assertion
is
a
single
reference
in
the

space
will
not
allow
of
the
investigation
of
this
authority
but
baron
de
cosson
in
the
catalogue
above
quoted
effectively
disposes
of
theory
the
salient
points
of
the
burgonet
as
may
be
seen
on

are
the
umbril
or
brim
projecting
over
the
eyes
and
the
upstanding
comb
or
in
some

the
burgonet

called
the
buffe
and
like
the
beavor
worn
with
the
salade
is
held
in
place
by
a
strap
round
the
neck
this
form
of
helmet
was
chiefly
used
by
light
cavalry
the
morion
and
the
cabasset
are
both
helmets
worn
by
and
appear
about
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
cabasset
is
generally
to
be
distinguished
by
the
curious
little
point
projecting
from
the
apex
often
the
comb
and
upturned
brim
of
the
morion
are
extravagant
in
form
and
tend
to
make
the
helmet
exceedingly
heavy
and
inconvenient

and
most
manifest
signs
of
decadence
are
to
be
found
in
two
aspects
of
that
craft
the
first
of
these
is
that
which
refers
to
the
material
used
with

this
consideration
is
faithfully
adhered
to
in
most
examples
of

work
up
to
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
but
by
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
we
find
the
craftsman
becoming
wearied
of
his
technical
perfection
and
the
simplicity
and
constructional
dignity
which
invariably
accompanies
such
perfection
his
efforts
are
now
directed
to
fashioning
his
metal
into
such
forms
as
in
no
way
suggest
his
material
but
only
show
a
certain
meretricious
skill
in
workmanship
fig
shows
a
very
favourite
form
of
this
artistic
incoherence
the
defensive
properties
of
the
helmet
are
in
no
way
increased
but
rather
are
annulled
by
presenting
hollows
and
projections
where
before
a
smooth
surface
existed
it
is
superfluous
to
point
out
the
grotesque
and
bizarre
effect
of
this
human
face
in
metal
another
instance
of
this
wilful
disregard
of
material
is
to
be
noticed
in
those
suits
which
imitate
the
puffed
and
slashed
dress
in
fashion
for
civilian
wear
during
the
sixteenth
century
many
of
these
suits
exist
in
english
and
european
armouries
which
proves
that
they
were
popular
but
to
the
true
craftsman
there
is
something
degrading
in
the
efforts
of
the
expert
ironworker
expending
his
energies
not
to
produce
a
finely
constructed
piece
of
work
but
rather
to
imitate
the
seams
and
pipings
of
the
work
of
a
tailor
or
dressmaker
and
however
much
we
may
admire
his
technical
skill
we
must
perforce
place
his
artistic
aspirations
side
by
side
with
the
and
marbler
who
was
so
conspicuous

factor
in
domestic
decoration
in
the
middle

this
decadence
carried
to
its
furthest
pitch
by
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
renaissance
which
had
been
in
the
first
instance
the
birth
of
all
that
is
best
in
european
art
and
craftsmanship
became
a
baneful
influence
the
expert
painter
having
mastered
the
intricacies
of
his
art
turned
them
into
extravagant
channels
and
exaggerated
action
foreshortened
figures
and
optical
illusions
took
the
place
of
the
dignified
compositions
of
the
earlier
period
nor
could
the
crafts
escape
this
deadly
poison
to
the
credit
of
the
craftsmen
we
may
hope
that
the
luxurious
indulgence
and
ostentatious
display
of
the
princely
patron
was
the
cause
of
decadence
in
the
crafts
rather
than
the
inclination
of
the
workers
themselves
still
the
fact
remains
that
as
soon
as
the
plain
and
constructionally
sound
work
began
to
be
overspread
with
ornament
architecture
and
all
the
allied
arts
began
to
be
debased
from
their
former
high
position
with
the
decoration
of
armour
its
practical
utility
began
to
decline
it
must
be
admitted
however
that
one
reason
for
the
decoration
was
that
armour
was
by
degrees
less
and
less
used
for
war
and
only
retained
for
pageant
joust
and
parade
in
which
personal
display
and
magnificence
were
demanded

this
interference

is
noticeable
in

even
here
there
is
some
excuse
in
that

had
reason
for
his
embossing
of

metal

imitation
of

was
to
be
carefully
portrayed
the
same
however
can
not
be
urged
for
those
suits

are
simply
covered
with
ornament
with
no
purpose
little
meaning

less
composition

design

we
set
aside

opinions

will
be
sufficient
to
give
one
example
of
this
prostitution
of
art
and
craftsmanship
this

negroli
fig
and
a
similar
example
signed
by
negroli
at

show
how
the
canons
of
the
armourer
craft
were
ignored
at
this
period
it
is
true
that
the
casque
still
provides
a
metal
covering
for
the
head
and
that
the
comb
gives
an
additional
protection
to
the
skull
but
when
we
examine
the
embossed
figures
at
the
side
and
marvellously
good
the
embossing
is
we
find
lodgements
for
the
sword
or
spear
which
would
most
certainly
help
to
detach
the
helmet
from
its
wearer
as
to
the
comb
it
may
fairly
be
cited
as
an
example
of
all
that
is
artistically
worst
in
the
late
renaissance
its
technical
merits
only
emphasize
this
the
warrior
is
laid
on
his
back
to
suit
the
required
shape
of
the
helmet
and
to
give
point
to
his
position
his
hair
is
held
by
two
figures
whose
attributes
seem
to
suggest
that
intercrossing
of
birds
beasts
and
fishes
which
delighted
the
decadent
mind
of
the
period
the
figures
are
human
to
the
waist
and
end
in
a
dolphin
tail
wings
spring
from
their
shoulders
and
leopards
claws
from
the
junction
of
tail
and
waist
not
content
with
this
outrage
to
the
dignity
of
art
the
craftsman
ends
his
warrior
in
an
architectural
base
which
has
not
even
the
slight
merit
of
probability
which
the
tail
of
the
merman
might
offer
in
short
it
is
an
example
of
technical
skill
at
its
highest
and
artistic
perception
at
its
lowest
point
the
shield
from
the
vienna
collection
fig
is
another
example
like
king
sebastian
suit
of
meaningless
decoration
the
strap
work
does
not
in
any
way
follow
the
lines
of
the
shield
and
the
female
figures
seem
to
be
introduced
only
to
show
that
the
craftsman
could
portray
the
human
form
in
steel
as
easily
as
he
could
the
more
conventional
ornament
as
the
armourer
weary
of
constructional
skill
turned
to
ornament
as
a
means
of
showing
to
what
further
extent
his
powers
could
expand
so
with
this
change
in
his
point
of
view
his
constructional
skill
itself
declined
the
headpiece
which
in
the
golden
age
of
the
armourer
was
forged
in
as
few
pieces
as
possible
is
in
the
late
seventeenth
century
made
of
many
pieces
as
the
art
of
skilful
forging
declines
the
ingenious
articulations
of
the
soleret
are
changed
and
the
foot
is
cased
in
plates
which
overlapping
only
in
one
direction
preclude
the
easy
movement
of
the
wearer
the
fine
lines
of
leg
and
arm
defences
which
in
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
century
follow
the
shape
of
the
limbs
give
place
to
straight
tubular
plates
which
can
only
be
likened
to
the
modern
the
grace
and
symmetry
of
the
gothic
suit
shown
on
plate

especially
the
leg
armour
exemplify
this
merit
of
the
best
period
of
armour
while
the
suit
made
for
louis
xiv
and
the
gilt
suit
of
charles
i
in
the
tower
offend
in
the
opposite
direction
another
sure
indication
of
the
decadence
of
the
craftsman
is
to
be
found
in
the
imitation
of
constructional
detail
with
no
practical
purpose
examples
of
this
may
be
seen
in
late
armour
where
a
single
plate
is
embossed
to
represent
several
overlapping
plates
or
lames
and
also
in
the
plentiful
use
of
or
false
rivets
which
are
scattered
broadcast
on
some
suits
in
places
where
no
rivets
are
needed
to
turn
from
the
degradation
of
the
simplicity
and
constructional
perfection
of
armour
to
the
reasons
which
led
to
its
gradual
disuse
we
find
that
after
the
gothic
period
armour
became
heavier
partly
because
of
the
shock
tactics
in
vogue
on
active
service
and
partly
because
in
the
case
of
jousting
armour
strength
and
great
weight
were
needed
to
protect
the
wearer
from
vital
injury
and
partly
because
the
improvement
of
firearms
necessitated
extra
defence
the
temper
of
the
metal
used
was
such
that
it
would
resist
a
pistol
shot
as
we
have
noticed
in
chapter
iii
and
on
examining
the
surface
of
the
metal
we
find
as
in
the
pembridge
helm
that
it
is
of
so
fine
a
texture
that
a
modern
knife
will
not
leave
a
scratch
when
testing
it
therefore
we
must
regard
the
weight
of
armour
as
one
of
the
chief
reasons
for
its
disuse
again
military
tactics
necessitated
forced
marches
and
longer
expeditions
than
before
or
at
any
rate
it
was
discovered
that
when
engaging
in
long
expeditions
the
troops
were
chafed
and
hindered
by
their
armour
it
is
somewhat
curious
to
note
that
as
the
leg
was
the
first
part
of
the
body
to
be
armed
with
plate
so
the
leg
armour
was
the
first
to
be
discarded
the
jambs
were
the
first
pieces
to
go
and
were
replaced
in
the
case
of
the
mounted
man
by
thick
buff
leather
boots
the
tassets
were
prolonged
to
the
knee
or
to
describe
this
portion
of
the
armour
in
a
different
way
the
cuisses
themselves
were
formed
of
riveted
lames
and
the
tassets
discarded

helmet
at
the
latter
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
is
generally
open
and
of
the
burgonet
type

breastplate
is
usually
short
and
projects
downwards
at
the
lower
portion
after
the
fashion
of
the
doublet
of
civilian
wear
as
early
as
at
the
siege
of
zutphen
we
find
officers
discarding
their
armour
and
keeping
only
the
cuirass
from
the
hatfield
mss
we
learn
that
a
penny
a
day
was
allowed
to
each
soldier
in
over
and
above
his
pay
for
the
wearing
and
carriage
of
his
armour

it
had
become
the
custom
for
the
troops
to
give
their
accoutrements
to
the
when
on
the
march
matter
both
unseemly
for
soldiers
and
also
very
hurtful
unto
the
armour

bruising
and
breaking
thereof

it
becometh
unserviceable

instructions
for

find

the

wholly
left

as
the
hedging
bill
in
use
at
the
present
day
the
lochaber
axe
is
of
much
the
same
form
its
distinguishing
feature
being
the
hook
at
the
top
of
the
shaft
which
was
used
in
scaling
walls
the
glaive
is
also
a
weapon
but
where
the
bill
and
gisarme
are
more
or
less
straight
towards
the
edge
the
glaive
curves
backwards
it
is
often
to
be
found
richly
engraved
for
show
purposes
in
french
writings
the
word
glaive
is
sometimes
loosely
used
for
lance
or
sword
the
stabbing
or
thrusting
weapons
include
the
lance
spear
and
javelin
after
these
the
most
important
is
the
pike
this
is
very
similar
to
the
spear
but
was
used
exclusively
by
in
the
seventeenth
century
it
was
carried
by
infantry
interspersed
among
the
arquebusiers
there
are
several
works
on
and
treatises
on
its
management
lord
orrery
in
his
of
comments
on
the
differences
in
length
and
recommends
that
all
should
be
feet
long
the
shaft
was
made
of
seasoned
ash
and
the
head
was
fastened
with
two
cheeks
of
iron
often
feet
long
which
ran
down
the
shaft
to
prevent
the
head
being
cut
off
by
cavalry
at
the
was
a
spike
for
sticking
into
the
ground
when
resisting
cavalry
in
a
treatise
entitled
art
of
directions
are
given
that
the
of
the
shaft
should
be
covered
with
velvet
to
afford
a
sure
hold
for
the
hand
this
grip
was
called
the
armin
there
are
also
suggestions
that
a
tassel
should
be
fixed
midway
to
prevent
the
rain
running
down
the
shaft
and
so
causing
the
hand
to
slip
when
we
consider
that
the
pikeman
had
to
keep
the
cavalry
at
bay
while
the
arquebusier
was
reloading
a
lengthy
process
we
can
understand
the
importance
of
these
regulations
the
pike
was
carried
by
the
in
the
british
army
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
was
last
used
in
the
french
army
in
the
spontoon
is
a
species
of
which
was
carried
by
the
in
the
british
army
up
to
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
if
not
longer
the
spetum
and
the
ranseur
are
often
confused
the
names
are
usually
given
to
those
weapons
which
have
sharp
lateral
projections
fixed
at
a
more
or
less
acute
angle
to
the
point
they
could
not
be
used
for
cutting
but
used
for
thrusting
they
inflicted
terrible
wounds
the
partizan
is
somewhat
of
the
same
order
but
is
known
best
in
museums
in
its
decorated
form
as
used
in
ceremonial
parades
these
were
used
by
the
judge
guard
in
oxford
up
to
and
are
still
carried
by
the
yeomen
of
the
guard
on
state
occasions

although

is
so
essentially
a
part
of
the
firearm
that
we
need
do
no
more
than
mention
it
among
the
thrusting
weapons
the
scope
of
this
work
will
not
allow
of
any
notice
of
firearms
that
subject
owing
to
modern
developments
is
too
wide
to
be
treated
in
a
few
sentences
of
weapons
the
club
or
mace
is
to
be
found
on
the
bayeux
tapestry
and
is
generally
quatrefoil
or
at
the
head
the
mace
was
the
weapon
of
militant
ecclesiastics
who
thus
escaped
the
denunciation
against
who
fight
with
the
sword
it
is
generally
supposed
that
the
gibet
was
of
the
same
order
wace
in
the
de
line
writes
et
il
le
gibet
seisi
ki
a
sun
destre
bras
pendi
the
mace
was
usually
carried
slung
by
a
loop
to
the
or
on
the
right
wrist
so
that
when
sword
or
lance
were
lost
it
could
be
used
at
once
a
less
ornamental
weapon
is
the
sprinkler
this
is
formed
of
a
ball
of
iron
studded
with
sharp
projecting
spikes
and
fixed
upon
a
long
or
short
handle
the
morning
star
is
akin
to
the
military
flail
a
weapon
derived
from
the
agricultural
implement
of
that
name
it
is
much
the
same
as
the
sprinkler
except
that
the
spiked
ball
is
not
socketed
on
the
handle
but
hangs
from
a
chain
fig
the
names
of
these
two
weapons
are
often
transposed
but
we
propose
to
adhere
to
the
nomenclature
used
in
the
tower
armouries
as
being
more
likely
to
be
correct
the
and
need
but
little
description
they
were
generally
used
by
horsemen
and
their
general
form
only
varies
in
detail
from
implements
in
use
at
the
present
day
the
was
a
weapon
in
great
request
for
jousting
on
foot
in
the
clos
the
blade
is
much
like
the
halbard
but
at
the
back
is
a
projection
with
a
roughened
surface
the
longbow
may
be
said
to
have
gained
the
battles
of
senlac
crecy
and
agincourt
and
so
ranks
as
one
of
the
most
important
of
english
weapons
it
was
from
to
feet
in
length
and
was
made
of
yew
or
when
this
wood
was
scarce
of
witch
hazel
it
is
a
popular
tradition
in
the
country
that
the
which
were
so
important
for
the
manufacture
of
this
weapon
were
grown
in
churchyards
because
they
were
poisonous
to
cattle
and
the
churchyards
were
the
only
spaces
there
is
however
no
documentary
evidence
to
support
this
the
string
was
of
hemp
or
silk
the
archer
carried
shafts
in
his
belt
and
wore
a
called
a
bracer
to
protect
his
wrist
from
the
recoil
of
the
string
these
bracers
were
of
ivory
or
leather
and
were
often
decorated
the
arrows
were
tipped
with
the
but
roger
ascham
in
his
writes
that
peacock
arrows
were
used
gayness
so
notable
were
the
english
for
their
productions
that
in
we
find
the
pope
sending
to
this
country
for
bows
the
crossbow
or
arbalest
is
first
heard
of
in
the
twelfth
century
and
at
this
date
was
considered
so
a
weapon
that
the
popes
forbade
its
use
innocent
ii
in
fulminated
against
this
barbarous
weapon
but
allowed
of
its
use
by
christians
against
infidels
by
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
however
it
was
in
general
use
at
first
the
crossbow
was
strung
by
hand
but
when
it
was
made
more
powerful
mechanical
means
had
to
be
resorted
to
to
bend
the
bow
which
was
often
of
steel
there
are
two
varieties
of
war
crossbows
that
strung
with
the
lever
which
is
shown
on
fig
and
a
heavier
kind
called
the
arbalest
which
was
strung
with
a
and
ratchet
arrangement
called
the
moulinet
or
windlass
fig
the
arbalest
is
a
larger
form
of
this
variety
the
archer
using
these
heavy
weapons
was
entrenched
behind
a
pavis
or
shield
fixed
in
the
ground
as
shown
on
fig
the
quarel
or
bolt
used
for
the
crossbow
is
shorter
and
thicker
than
that
used
for
the
longbow
illustration
fig
crossbow
and
lever
illustration
fig
crossbow
and
windlass
of
the
other
weapons
such
as
the
fustibal
or
sling
the
different
forms
of
catapult
used
in
siege
operations
and
the
innumerable
varieties
of
firearm
we
have
no
space
to
write
the
former
being
mostly
fashioned
of
wood
and
cordage
are
seldom
to
be
met
with
in
museums
and
we
can
only
judge
of
their
design
and
use
from
illuminated
miniatures
and
paintings
the
firearm
being
as
it
is
subject
to
further
development
can
not
be
taken
into
full
consideration
in
this
work
except
so
far
as
it
affected
the
defensive
armour
and
in
time
ousted
the
with
this
bare
enumeration
of
the
principal
weapons
in
use
from
the
twelfth
to
the
eighteenth
century
we
draw
our
all
too
meagre
notes
to
a
conclusion
the
subject
is
so
vast
because
each
example
is
distinct
in
itself
and
because
no
general
rule
holds
absolutely
good
for
all
that
many
volumes
might
be
produced
with
advantage
on
each
epoch
of
the
defences
and
weapons
of
europe
no
better
advice
to
the
student
can
be
given
than
that
of
baron
de
cosson
in
the
introduction
to
the
catalogue
of
helmets
and
mail
vol
xxxvii
he
writes
the
study
of
ancient
armour
to
be
successfully
pursued
it
is
of
primary
importance
that
a
careful
examination
be
made
of
every
existing
specimen
within
our
reach
every
and
rivet
in
a
piece
must
be
studied
and
its
use
and
object
thought
out
the
reasons
for
the
varied
forms
thicknesses
and
structure
of
the
different
parts
must
have
special
attention
this
alone
will
enable
us
to
derive
full
profit
from
our
researches
into
ancient
authors
and
our
examination
of
ancient
monuments
this
preliminary
study
will
alone
enable
us
to
form
a
sound
opinion
on
two
important
points
first
the
authority
to
be
accorded
to
any
given
representation
of
armour
in
ancient
art
whether
it
was
copied
from
real
armour
or
whether
it
was
the
outcome
of
the
artist
imagination
and
also
whether
a
piece
of
existing
armour
is
genuine
or
false
and
whether
or
no
it
is
in
its
primitive
condition
to
this
may
be
added
that
in
studying
armour
at
its
best
epoch
that
is
during
the
fifteenth
century
we
find
the
dignity
of
true
craftsmanship
proclaimed
and
utility
and
grace
attained
without
the
addition
of
that
decoration
which
with
the
advent
of
the
renaissance
was
the
bane
of
all
the

the
terms
and
and
words
of
french
origin
are
open
to
some
objection
in
an
english
work
when
or
and
can
be
substituted
they
are
only
employed
here
because
of
their
general
use
in
armouries
at
the
present
day
and
because
the
english
words
are
of
rarer
occurrence
and
are
less
likely
to
be
met
with
by
those
beginning
the
study
of
armour
and
however
are
always
used

this
is
the
see
that
this
fashion
in
helmets
was
a
general
one
we
may
judge
from
the
fact
that
most
armouries
possess
examples
of
these
helmets
this
suit
is
shown
with
the
brayette
attached
which
for
obvious
reasons
is
exhibited
in
most
armouries
