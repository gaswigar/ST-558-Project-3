the
invitation
any
news
mother
asked
edna
one
friday
afternoon
when
she
came
home
from
school
there
a
letter
from
grandma
replied
conway
after
kissing
the
lips
held
up
to
hers
there
is
any
real
news
in
it
but
there
is
an
invitation
what
kind
of
an
invitation
a
thanksgiving
kind
oh
mother
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
grandma
wants
us
all
to
spend
an
thanksgiving
with
her
the
kind
she
used
to
have
when
she
was
young
she
says
she
and
grandpa
are
both
getting
old
and
they
may
not
be
able
to
have
the
whole
family
there
together
again
and
are
we
going
yes
i
think
so
the
whole
family
i
think
perhaps
you
and
i
will
go
on
a
day
or
two
ahead
and
let
the
others
follow
celia
and
the
boys
can
come
with
your
father
who
probably
could
not
get
off
till
wednesday
afternoon
grandma
asks
that
i
bring
my
baby
with
me
and
that
means
me
returned
edna
hugging
herself
how
long
shall
we
stay
mother
that
depends
upon
several
things
which
will
have
to
be
learned
later
so
i
ca
tell
just
yet
edna
danced
off
to
hunt
up
her
brothers
that
she
might
tell
them
the
news
she
found
them
in
their
little
workshop
over
the
stable
charlie
was
making
a
new
box
to
put
in
his
pigeon
house
and
frank
was
watching
him
they
had
not
seen
their
little
sister
since
monday
for
she
and
her
sister
celia
went
to
school
in
the
city
remaining
until
the
friday
afternoon
of
each
week
hello
cried
charlie
looking
up
when
did
you
come
oh
we
just
come
only
a
few
minutes
ago
and
what
do
you
think
is
the
news
the
dutch
have
taken
holland
returned
charlie
hammering
away
at
his
box
just
hand
me
that
box
of
nails
frank
wo
you
that
a
silly
answer
said
edna
with
contempt
well
if
it
news
how
did
you
expect
me
to
know
it
i
did
expect
you
to
know
it
only
to
guess
well
i
guessed
replied
charlie
teasingly
i
suppose
it
a
foolish
sort
of
thing
uncle
justus
has
grown
another
hair
in
his
eyebrows
or
your
friend
dorothy
has
a
new
hat
it
nothing
so
unimportant
edna
continued
for
it
concerns
you
boys
too
but
if
you
do
want
to
know
i
go
up
to
dorothy
be
interested
even
if
she
is
going
going
where
cried
both
boys
that
for
me
to
know
and
for
you
to
find
out
retorted
edna
beginning
to
scramble
down
the
ladder
both
boys
darted
after
charlie
swung
himself
down
ahead
of
her
to
the
floor
below
and
was
ready
to
grab
her
before
she
reached
the
last
rung
then
there
was
much
laughing
scrambling
tickling
and
protesting
till
at
last
edna
was
compelled
to
give
up
her
secret
ending
triumphantly
with
and
i
going
first
with
mother
who
said
so
questioned
charlie
mother
did
we
are
to
go
two
or
three
days
ahead
of
anyone
else
oh
well
i
do
care
returned
charlie
there
would
be
any
boys
for
me
to
play
with
anyhow
how
many
are
coming
for
thanksgiving
asked
frank
i
do
know
exactly
edna
answered
but
i
suppose
all
the
aunts
and
cousins
and
uncles
that
can
get
there
aunt
lucia
and
uncle
bert
and
of
course
aunt
alice
and
her
boys
ben
and
his
brother
ben
will
have
to
go
and
i
awfully
glad
he
my
favoritest
cousin
how
about
louis
he
is
not
any
relation
to
grandma
and
grandpa
willis
is
he
i
do
know
i
never
could
get
relations
straight
i
hope
he
is
any
kin
to
them
and
i
am
sorry
he
is
to
us
for
he
is
a
pill
you
know
he
is
no
matter
what
you
say
just
look
how
he
acted
last
summer
you
need
try
to
excuse
him
for
dorothy
told
me
all
about
it
edna
could
not
deny
facts
for
it
was
quite
true
that
her
cousin
louis
was
not
above
blame
in
sundry
instances
so
she
changed
the
subject
by
saying
i
think
i
go
over
to
dorothy
anyhow
the
boys
did
not
try
to
detain
her
and
she
ran
out
along
the
road
and
up
to
the
house
where
her
friend
dorothy
evans
lived
dorothy
was
playing
with
her
kitten
out
on
the
side
porch
she
had
dressed
the
little
creature
in
long
clothes
and
was
walking
up
and
down
singing
to
it
as
it
lay
contentedly
in
her
arms
it
two
gray
paws
sticking
out
from
the
sleeves
of
a
little
red
sacque
belonging
to
one
of
dolls
does
tiddlywinks
look
funny
said
dorothy
by
way
of
greeting
and
is
he
good
i
believe
he
likes
to
be
dressed
up
for
he
lies
as
still
as
anything
of
course
if
he
fussed
and
meowed
i
would
take
off
the
things
and
let
him
go
edna
touched
the
soft
silvery
paws
gently
i
believe
he
does
like
it
she
returned
see
he
shuts
his
eyes
exactly
as
if
he
felt
nice
and
cozy
oh
dorothy
guess
what
we
are
all
going
to
grandpa
willis
next
week
we
are
all
going
for
thanksgiving
only
mother
and
i
are
going
first
is
that
lovely
lovely
for
you
i
suppose
replied
dorothy
dejectedly
but
i
shall
miss
you
dreadfully
oh
no
you
wo
when
you
have
margaret
and
nettie
so
near
besides
i
shall
not
be
gone
long
not
more
than
a
week
are
there
any
girls
there
asked
dorothy
a
little
jealously
not
like
us
there
is
a
little
girl
mother
says
that
grandma
has
taken
in
to
help
her
and
amanda
amanda
is
the
woman
who
lives
there
and
cooks
and
churns
and
does
all
sorts
of
things
is
it
in
the
real
country
it
is
real
country
and
yet
it
is
for
it
is
a
village
grandpa
has
a
farm
but
just
across
the
street
is
a
store
and
the
church
is
only
a
few
steps
away
and
there
are
lots
of
neighbors
some
have
big
places
and
some
have
little
ones
grandpa
is
as
big
as
the
biggest
nor
as
little
as
the
littlest
does
he
keep
horses
and
cows
and
chickens
and
things
oh
my
yes
and
ducks
and
turkeys
and
sheep
i
should
think
it
would
be
a
pretty
nice
sort
of
place
it
is
lovely
and
i
am
always
crazy
about
going
there
but
please
do
stay
too
long
this
time
urged
dorothy
i
have
to
stay
till
mother
brings
me
back
returned
edna
cheerfully
i
wish
there
were
another
kitten
dorothy
so
i
could
have
a
live
doll
too
you
might
take
the
mother
cat
dorothy
suggested
she
is
very
gentle
and
nice
they
went
in
search
of
tiddlywinks
mother
but
madam
pittypat
objected
to
being
made
a
baby
of
for
though
she
was
gentle
enough
she
squirmed
and
twisted
herself
out
of
every
garment
they
tried
upon
her
and
at
the
first
opportunity
walked
off
in
a
most
dignified
manner
as
though
she
would
say
such
a
way
to
treat
the
mother
of
a
family
so
the
two
little
girls
concluded
that
they
would
free
tiddlywinks
and
turn
him
again
into
a
kitten
they
left
him
stretching
himself
and
yawning
lazily
as
they
trudged
off
to
see
their
friend
margaret
mcdonald
that
they
might
tell
her
edna
news
the
days
sped
by
quickly
until
tuesday
came
when
edna
and
her
mother
were
to
start
on
their
journey
edna
at
first
decided
to
take
her
doll
ada
because
she
is
more
used
to
traveling
she
said
but
at
the
last
moment
she
changed
her
mind
saying
that
ada
had
been
on
so
many
journeys
that
she
thought
someone
else
should
have
a
chance
and
therefore
it
was
her
new
doll
virginia
who
was
dressed
for
the
trip
the
previous
year
edna
had
spent
thanksgiving
day
with
her
uncle
justus
this
year
it
would
be
quite
a
different
thing
to
sit
at
table
with
a
whole
company
of
cousins
instead
of
dining
alone
with
uncle
justus
it
was
a
journey
of
three
hours
before
the
station
of
mayville
was
reached
then
a
drive
of
four
miles
to
overlea
lay
before
them
but
there
was
grandpa
himself
waiting
to
help
them
off
the
train
to
see
that
their
trunks
were
safely
stowed
into
the
big
farm
wagon
and
at
last
to
tuck
them
snugly
into
the
carriage
which
was
to
bear
them
to
the
white
house
set
in
behind
a
stately
row
of
maples
these
had
lost
their
leaves
but
a
crimson
oak
still
showed
its
red
against
the
sky
and
the
vines
clambering
up
the
porch
waved
out
scarlet
banners
to
welcome
the
guests
grandma
willis
was
standing
on
the
porch
to
greet
them
as
they
drew
up
before
the
door
behind
her
stood
amanda
and
behind
amanda
a
little
girl
about
twelve
or
thirteen
behind
the
little
girl
trailed
a
cat
and
three
kittens
at
the
sight
of
these
edna
gave
a
squeal
of
delight
new
kittens
grandma
how
lovely
i
so
glad
she
cried
grandma
smiled
well
give
me
a
good
hug
and
kiss
first
and
then
reliance
can
let
you
take
one
of
the
kittens
to
hug
who
is
reliance
is
that
what
you
call
the
no
her
name
is
tippy
reliance
is
the
little
girl
who
we
hope
is
going
to
carry
out
the
promise
of
her
name
edna
did
not
understand
this
latter
speech
but
she
smiled
encouragingly
at
reliance
who
smiled
back
at
her
then
after
the
huggings
and
kissings
were
given
to
willis
reliance
picked
up
one
of
the
kittens
and
held
it
out
to
edna
who
cuddled
it
up
to
her
and
followed
the
others
into
the
house
it
was
a
big
place
where
the
willis
family
had
lived
for
many
generations
in
the
large
was
a
huge
fireplace
in
which
now
a
roaring
fire
crackled
and
leaped
high
there
was
a
small
seat
close
to
it
and
on
this
edna
settled
herself
here
here
are
you
going
to
stay
a
while
cried
grandpa
who
had
given
over
the
carriage
into
the
hands
of
ira
the
hired
man
and
who
had
just
come
in
why
of
course
we
are
going
to
stay
replied
edna
then
why
do
you
take
off
your
things
mother
is
there
any
place
they
can
lay
their
bonnets
and
coats
it
seems
to
me
there
should
be
a
bed
or
cupboard
somewhere
now
father
protested
willis
you
know
this
house
is
big
enough
to
hold
the
hats
and
coats
of
the
entire
family
did
know
but
you
were
and
had
every
place
turned
upside
down
now
father
willis
continued
you
know
we
been
days
getting
the
house
cleaned
and
that
everything
is
in
order
for
thanksgiving
grandpa
gave
conway
a
sly
wink
you
think
it
ought
to
be
in
order
he
said
by
the
way
they
have
been
tearing
up
the
place
could
find
my
papers
my
sticks
my
umbrella
or
anything
when
i
wanted
them
i
am
glad
you
all
have
come
so
you
can
help
me
hunt
for
them
why
father
how
you
do
go
on
willis
interposed
the
old
gentleman
laughed
he
was
a
great
tease
as
edna
well
knew
where
shall
we
go
to
lay
off
our
things
mother
asked
conway
up
to
your
own
old
room
over
the
here
reliance
take
the
kitten
and
you
edna
can
come
along
with
your
mother
there
no
need
for
you
to
go
up
mother
said
conway
i
have
been
there
before
you
know
and
i
think
i
can
find
the
way
then
the
two
smiled
wisely
at
one
another
but
grandma
would
go
and
presently
edna
found
herself
in
a
large
room
which
looked
out
upon
the
west
conway
stood
still
and
gazed
around
her
how
natural
it
all
seems
she
said
even
to
the
pictures
upon
the
walls
i
went
from
this
room
a
bride
edna
and
when
i
come
back
to
it
i
feel
not
a
day
older
this
is
the
same
furniture
but
this
is
a
new
carpet
mother
and
new
curtains
and
the
little
cot
you
have
put
in
for
edna
i
suppose
yes
there
are
some
things
that
will
not
last
a
lifetime
answered
willis
and
we
must
furbish
up
once
in
a
while
i
thought
you
would
rather
have
edna
here
with
you
than
elsewhere
and
at
such
a
crowded
time
we
have
to
stow
away
as
we
can
i
have
put
another
cot
in
my
room
for
one
of
the
other
children
and
celia
is
to
go
in
with
becky
while
they
were
talking
ira
brought
up
the
trunks
and
conway
commenced
the
task
of
unpacking
so
very
soon
they
were
settled
and
ready
for
dinner
which
was
served
in
the
big
where
was
another
open
fireplace
not
quite
so
large
as
the
first
but
ample
enough
reliance
waited
upon
the
table
and
helped
to
clear
away
the
dishes
afterward
when
you
are
through
with
your
tasks
reliance
you
can
take
edna
out
and
show
her
the
chickens
and
pigs
and
things
said
grandma
reliance
is
quite
a
recent
addition
to
the
family
is
she
said
conway
when
the
little
maid
went
out
yes
willis
replied
amanda
is
as
young
as
she
was
and
we
thought
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
have
someone
here
who
could
save
her
steps
and
who
could
be
trained
to
take
her
place
after
a
while
i
think
reliance
promises
to
be
very
capable
in
time
while
her
mother
talked
to
the
grandparents
edna
walked
softly
around
the
room
looking
at
the
different
things
the
pictures
books
and
ornaments
there
was
a
high
mantel
upon
which
stood
a
pair
of
dresden
vases
and
two
quaint
little
figures
in
the
middle
was
a
china
house
with
a
red
door
and
vines
over
the
windows
edna
had
always
admired
it
and
was
glad
to
see
it
still
there
she
stood
looking
at
it
for
a
long
time
she
liked
to
have
her
grandmother
tell
her
its
history
that
was
brought
to
me
by
my
grandfather
when
he
returned
from
england
willis
always
said
i
was
a
little
girl
about
six
years
old
later
he
brought
me
those
two
china
figures
he
was
a
naval
officer
and
that
is
his
portrait
you
see
hanging
on
the
wall
i
love
the
little
house
remarked
edna
knowing
that
the
next
word
would
be
you
may
play
with
it
if
you
are
very
careful
it
is
one
of
my
oldest
treasures
and
i
should
be
very
grieved
if
it
were
broken
the
little
house
was
then
handed
down
and
edna
examined
it
carefully
it
is
so
very
pretty
she
said
that
i
should
like
to
live
in
it
i
would
like
to
live
in
a
house
with
a
bright
red
door
i
used
to
think
that
same
thing
when
i
was
a
little
girl
her
grandmother
told
her
i
think
maybe
you
better
put
it
back
so
i
wo
break
it
said
edna
carefully
handing
the
treasure
to
her
grandmother
and
then
will
you
please
tell
me
about
the
pictures
the
one
over
the
mantel
is
called
signing
of
the
declaration
of
independence
and
that
small
framed
affair
by
the
chimney
is
a
key
to
it
for
it
tells
the
names
of
the
different
men
who
figure
in
the
picture
i
will
look
at
it
some
day
and
see
if
i
can
find
out
which
is
which
said
edna
that
is
napoleon
bonaparte
over
there
i
know
him
yes
and
that
other
is
general
washington
whom
of
course
you
know
oh
yes
of
course
and
i
know
that
little
girl
the
black
head
over
there
it
is
my
the
silhouette
you
mean
yes
that
is
she
and
she
is
the
same
one
who
did
that
sampler
you
see
hanging
between
the
windows
she
was
not
so
old
as
you
when
she
did
it
edna
crossed
the
room
and
knelt
on
a
chair
in
front
of
the
sampler
it
was
dim
with
age
but
she
could
discern
a
border
of
pink
flowers
with
green
leaves
and
letters
worked
in
blue
silk
she
followed
the
letters
with
the
tip
of
her
finger
tracing
them
on
the
glass
and
at
last
spelling
out
the
name
of
annabel
lisle
wrought
in
her
seventh
year
poor
little
annabel
how
hard
she
must
have
worked
sighed
edna
i
am
glad
i
do
have
to
do
samplers
you
might
be
worse
employed
said
her
grandmother
smiling
did
you
ever
do
a
sampler
asked
edna
not
a
sampler
like
this
one
but
i
learned
to
work
in
cross
stitch
do
you
remember
the
little
stool
in
the
by
the
fireplace
the
one
with
roses
on
it
that
i
was
sitting
on
yes
that
i
did
when
i
was
about
your
age
and
the
sofa
pillow
with
the
two
doves
on
it
i
did
when
i
was
about
celia
age
i
was
very
proud
of
it
i
remember
may
i
go
look
at
them
assuredly
so
edna
went
into
the
next
room
and
carefully
examined
the
two
pieces
of
work
which
now
had
a
new
importance
in
her
eyes
a
little
girl
about
her
age
had
done
them
long
ago
she
discovered
too
a
picture
behind
the
door
it
was
of
a
lady
leaning
against
an
urn
a
tree
near
by
the
lady
held
a
handkerchief
in
her
hand
and
looked
very
sorrowful
edna
wondered
why
she
seemed
so
sad
there
were
some
words
written
below
but
they
were
too
faint
for
her
to
decipher
and
she
determined
to
ask
her
grandmother
about
this
picture
which
she
had
never
noticed
before
while
she
was
still
looking
at
it
reliance
came
to
the
door
to
say
i
can
go
now
i
finished
what
i
had
to
do
edna
turned
with
alacrity
and
the
two
went
out
together
chapter
ii
reliance
how
long
have
you
lived
here
edna
asked
her
companion
when
they
were
outside
about
six
months
was
the
reply
are
you
came
the
next
question
no
i
bound
edna
looked
puzzled
i
do
know
what
that
is
i
know
a
girl
that
was
a
friendless
and
she
was
so
now
she
has
a
mother
and
a
beautiful
home
her
name
used
to
be
maggie
horn
but
now
it
is
margaret
mcdonald
is
your
name
reliance
willis
no
it
is
reliance
fairman
and
it
was
ever
anything
else
i
was
friendless
too
till
willis
took
me
oh
and
did
you
live
in
a
house
with
a
lot
of
other
friendlesses
no
i
was
in
an
orphan
asylum
if
that
what
you
mean
but
i
reckon
i
would
have
had
to
go
there
or
else
to
the
almshouse
oh
this
seemed
even
more
dreadful
to
edna
and
she
looked
at
her
companion
with
new
interest
at
the
same
time
slipping
her
hand
into
the
other
to
show
her
sympathy
tell
me
about
it
she
said
why
you
see
my
parents
died
we
lived
about
three
miles
from
here
and
your
grandmother
used
to
know
my
grandmother
they
went
to
the
same
school
so
when
us
children
were
left
without
any
home
or
any
money
your
grandmother
said
she
would
take
me
and
keep
me
till
i
was
of
age
so
they
bound
me
how
many
children
were
there
three
boys
and
me
two
of
the
boys
are
with
lukens
and
the
other
is
in
a
home
he
is
a
little
chap
only
six
if
he
been
bigger
maybe
your
grandfather
would
have
had
him
here
and
perhaps
he
will
come
when
he
is
big
enough
to
be
of
any
use
i
think
that
would
be
very
nice
and
i
shall
ask
grandfather
to
be
sure
to
take
him
do
you
like
it
here
oh
yes
i
like
it
amanda
is
awful
pernickity
sometimes
but
i
just
love
your
grandmother
and
it
is
a
heap
sight
better
than
being
hungry
and
cold
would
you
have
to
stay
supposing
you
did
like
it
edna
was
determined
to
get
all
the
particulars
i
suppose
so
i
have
to
stay
till
i
was
eighteen
i
bound
to
do
that
edna
reflected
i
suppose
that
is
what
it
means
by
being
bound
you
are
just
bound
to
stay
i
wonder
if
anyone
else
was
ever
named
reliance
she
went
on
being
much
interested
to
hear
something
about
so
peculiar
a
name
my
grandmother
was
her
that
your
grandmother
knew
oh
was
she
then
you
are
named
after
your
grandmother
just
as
my
sister
celia
is
named
cecelia
after
hers
yours
is
a
funny
name
it
i
do
mean
funny
exactly
for
i
think
it
is
quite
pretty
but
i
never
knew
of
anyone
named
that
i
do
mind
it
when
i
get
it
all
but
when
my
brothers
called
me
li
i
did
like
it
your
grandmother
gives
me
the
whole
name
and
i
am
glad
she
does
but
she
said
they
generally
used
to
call
my
grandmother
lyley
when
she
was
a
little
girl
i
think
that
is
rather
pretty
too
do
you
yes
but
i
like
the
whole
name
better
then
i
will
always
call
you
by
the
whole
name
edna
assured
her
can
you
tell
stories
reliance
do
you
mean
fibs
or
reading
stories
like
let
see
cinderella
and
jack
and
the
beanstalk
oh
i
mean
the
cinderella
kind
i
hate
to
think
you
told
fibs
i
can
tell
but
i
guess
i
do
care
to
i
know
two
or
three
of
the
other
kind
and
bible
stories
some
of
them
eli
and
samuel
and
david
and
goliath
and
all
those
do
you
go
to
school
half
the
year
but
i
guess
i
wo
be
going
very
much
longer
i
soon
be
going
on
fourteen
i
stop
when
i
fifteen
oh
shall
you
then
what
will
you
do
i
learn
to
housekeep
and
cook
and
to
sew
and
all
that
willis
says
it
is
more
important
for
me
to
be
educated
in
the
useful
things
that
i
get
along
better
if
i
am
and
i
guess
she
is
right
my
mother
could
cook
worth
a
cent
and
she
just
hated
it
so
we
did
get
very
good
vittles
was
it
your
mother
mother
after
whom
you
were
named
no
my
father
mother
the
fairmans
lived
around
here
but
there
many
of
them
left
now
my
father
was
an
only
child
and
he
married
my
mother
out
of
town
she
had
ever
been
used
to
the
country
she
used
to
work
in
a
store
and
that
why
she
could
cook
you
see
edna
pondered
over
this
information
wondering
if
everyone
who
worked
in
a
store
must
necessarily
turn
out
a
poor
cook
you
ought
just
to
see
what
getting
ready
for
thanksgiving
said
reliance
changing
the
subject
i
never
seen
such
a
pile
of
stuff
it
fair
makes
my
mouth
water
to
think
of
it
pies
and
cakes
and
doughnuts
and
jellies
and
i
do
know
what
all
i
guess
there
as
many
as
twenty
or
thirty
coming
ai
there
let
me
see
i
shall
have
to
count
there
will
be
aunt
alice
and
her
two
boys
ben
and
willis
and
uncle
bert
willis
with
his
five
children
and
aunt
lucia
that
makes
ten
and
then
there
will
be
all
of
us
papa
and
mamma
and
us
four
children
that
makes
let
me
see
she
counted
hurriedly
on
her
fingers
how
many
did
i
say
reliance
ten
oh
yes
and
six
make
sixteen
then
there
are
the
greats
great
aunt
emmeline
and
her
brother
wilbur
merrifield
and
his
daughter
cousin
becky
sixteen
did
i
say
and
three
make
nineteen
oh
yes
cousin
becky
sweetheart
that
she
is
going
to
marry
soon
he
is
coming
and
he
will
make
it
just
twenty
counting
grandpa
and
grandma
there
will
be
and
counting
you
and
amanda
there
will
be
to
eat
the
goodies
you
did
count
the
two
men
ira
and
jim
said
reliance
they
will
eat
here
too
oh
yes
i
forgot
them
what
a
crowd
people
if
they
cut
a
pie
in
six
pieces
it
would
take
over
four
to
go
around
once
it
i
suppose
we
would
be
allowed
a
second
piece
on
thanksgiving
day
remarked
reliance
though
maybe
with
the
other
things
no
one
would
want
it
how
many
kinds
of
pie
will
there
be
asked
edna
three
at
least
i
heard
amanda
say
that
she
would
make
the
fillings
for
pumpkin
lemon
and
apple
she
has
the
crust
all
done
she
has
made
the
jelly
too
it
to
be
served
with
whipped
cream
your
grandma
was
talking
about
having
plum
pudding
but
amanda
said
she
did
see
the
sense
of
having
it
when
it
was
christmas
and
there
would
be
such
lots
of
other
things
all
the
nuts
and
apples
and
such
things
there
is
going
to
be
chicken
pie
besides
the
turkeys
and
the
oysters
dear
me
sighed
edna
i
am
afraid
i
shall
eat
a
great
deal
and
be
very
uncomfortable
i
was
last
year
for
a
little
while
because
i
ate
two
thanksgiving
dinners
what
did
you
do
last
year
reliance
reliance
looked
very
sober
we
did
have
much
of
a
thanksgiving
last
year
for
it
was
just
before
my
mother
died
and
she
was
ill
then
so
us
children
just
had
to
get
along
the
best
we
could
somebody
sent
us
in
a
pie
and
some
jelly
for
mother
and
that
is
about
all
we
had
to
be
thankful
for
i
suppose
it
was
much
better
than
nothing
we
ate
all
the
pie
at
one
meal
billy
said
we
might
as
well
for
it
would
last
two
days
anyhow
unless
we
had
little
bits
of
pieces
so
each
of
us
had
a
whole
quarter
billy
tried
to
trap
a
rabbit
or
shoot
a
squirrel
or
something
but
he
had
enough
shot
and
the
rabbits
did
trap
secretly
edna
was
rather
glad
to
hear
this
even
though
it
meant
that
the
fairmans
went
without
meat
for
dinner
she
walked
along
pondering
over
these
facts
and
wondering
which
were
to
be
preferred
she
could
not
tell
whether
to
be
glad
the
squirrels
and
rabbits
had
escaped
or
to
be
sorry
that
the
fairmans
could
not
have
had
game
for
thanksgiving
it
was
rather
a
hard
matter
to
settle
so
finally
she
dismissed
the
subject
and
gave
her
attention
to
the
pigs
whose
pen
they
now
had
reached
edna
did
not
think
them
very
cleanly
or
attractive
creatures
however
and
was
very
soon
ready
to
leave
them
that
she
might
see
the
chickens
and
ducks
which
she
found
much
more
interesting
the
short
november
day
was
already
so
near
its
end
that
the
fowls
were
thinking
of
going
to
roost
though
the
hour
was
not
late
and
after
watching
them
take
their
supper
which
edna
helped
reliance
to
distribute
the
two
girls
went
on
to
the
garden
now
robbed
of
most
of
its
vegetables
there
were
a
few
tomatoes
to
be
found
on
the
vines
though
celery
turnips
and
cabbages
made
a
brave
showing
edna
felt
that
she
was
quite
a
discoverer
when
she
came
across
some
tiny
yellow
tomatoes
which
the
frost
had
not
yet
touched
and
which
she
gathered
in
triumph
to
carry
back
to
her
mother
i
know
where
there
a
chestnut
tree
announced
reliance
suddenly
oh
do
let
find
it
said
edna
i
will
put
the
tomatoes
in
my
handkerchief
and
carry
them
that
way
we
ought
to
gather
all
the
chestnuts
we
can
for
i
know
mighty
well
after
the
boys
come
there
be
a
nut
left
there
was
a
rush
down
the
hill
to
the
big
chestnut
tree
about
whose
roots
lay
the
prickly
burs
which
the
frost
had
opened
to
show
the
shining
brown
nuts
within
i
do
see
how
we
are
going
to
carry
them
said
edna
after
a
while
when
she
had
gathered
together
quite
a
little
heap
i
show
you
reliance
told
her
and
began
tying
knots
in
the
corners
of
the
apron
she
wore
there
she
said
that
makes
a
very
good
bag
and
what
we
ca
carry
that
way
we
can
leave
and
come
back
for
we
better
take
as
many
as
we
can
though
for
will
be
such
a
busy
day
i
may
not
be
able
to
come
and
if
we
do
the
squirrels
will
get
them
all
i
could
come
alone
now
that
i
know
the
way
said
edna
or
maybe
mamma
would
come
with
me
i
suppose
we
better
be
going
back
said
reliance
when
she
lifted
the
improvised
bag
to
her
arm
it
is
near
to
milking
time
and
that
means
getting
ready
for
supper
what
do
you
do
to
get
ready
for
supper
asked
edna
taking
hold
of
one
side
of
the
bag
oh
i
set
the
table
and
go
down
to
the
for
the
butter
and
cream
i
can
skim
milk
now
but
i
could
at
first
i
got
it
all
mixed
up
do
you
skim
all
the
milk
oh
no
that
we
put
on
the
table
to
drink
is
never
skimmed
the
skimmed
milk
goes
to
the
pigs
oh
does
it
i
think
you
feed
your
pigs
pretty
well
are
we
going
to
watch
them
milk
you
can
if
you
like
i
got
to
go
right
back
you
do
help
with
the
milking
then
no
ira
does
it
your
grandpa
says
it
is
man
work
but
ira
lets
me
do
a
little
sometimes
so
i
will
learn
are
you
afraid
of
the
cows
no
indeed
are
you
kind
of
they
have
such
sharp
horns
sometimes
answered
edna
by
way
of
excusing
her
fear
your
grandpa
do
have
he
keeps
only
dehorned
cattle
what
are
they
the
kind
that
have
had
their
horns
taken
off
so
they
do
do
any
damage
i
think
maybe
i
would
mind
that
kind
so
much
said
edna
after
considering
the
matter
for
a
moment
if
you
do
mind
i
think
i
would
like
to
stop
and
see
ira
milk
reliance
said
she
did
mind
in
the
least
and
therefore
she
left
the
little
girl
at
the
bars
of
the
stable
yard
which
was
quite
as
near
as
she
wished
to
stand
to
the
herd
of
cows
gathered
within
want
to
come
in
and
learn
to
milk
asked
ira
looking
up
with
a
smile
at
the
little
figure
oh
no
thank
you
returned
edna
hastily
i
rather
watch
you
she
would
really
have
like
to
try
her
hand
if
there
had
been
but
one
cow
but
when
there
were
six
how
could
a
young
person
be
certain
that
one
of
the
number
would
not
turn
and
rend
her
to
be
sure
they
were
much
less
fearsome
without
horns
but
still
they
were
too
big
and
dreadful
to
be
entirely
trusted
so
she
stood
watching
the
milk
foam
into
the
shining
tin
buckets
and
then
she
walked
contentedly
with
ira
to
where
amanda
was
waiting
to
strain
the
milk
and
put
it
away
in
the
do
you
keep
it
out
here
all
winter
and
does
it
freeze
asked
edna
in
winter
we
keep
it
in
the
pantry
up
at
the
house
if
it
should
turn
cold
suddenly
now
we
have
to
bring
it
in
amanda
told
her
as
she
carefully
lifted
the
earthen
crocks
into
place
there
comes
reliance
for
the
cream
and
butter
she
went
on
reliance
i
carry
up
the
milk
and
you
come
along
with
the
rest
do
tarry
down
here
and
be
sure
you
lock
the
door
and
fetch
in
the
key
then
she
went
out
leaving
the
two
little
girls
behind
reliance
carefully
attended
to
her
duties
edna
watching
her
admiringly
it
must
be
a
fine
thing
to
be
so
big
a
girl
as
this
one
who
could
be
trusted
to
do
work
like
a
woman
let
me
carry
something
she
offered
when
reliance
stepped
up
the
stone
steps
and
outside
carrying
the
butter
in
one
hand
and
the
pitcher
of
cream
in
the
other
if
you
would
lock
the
door
and
would
mind
taking
the
key
along
i
would
have
to
set
down
these
things
reliance
said
edna
did
as
she
was
asked
standing
in
order
to
turn
the
big
key
in
the
heavy
door
when
we
get
to
the
house
you
can
hang
the
key
on
its
nail
behind
the
kitchen
door
reliance
told
her
it
is
always
kept
there
edna
swung
the
big
key
on
her
finger
by
its
string
and
trotted
along
by
the
side
of
reliance
asking
many
questions
and
delighting
to
hear
reliance
enlarge
upon
the
subject
of
the
thanksgiving
festivities
we
got
to
get
up
good
and
early
reliance
remarked
for
a
heap
to
be
done
even
if
we
are
ahead
with
the
baking
i
expect
to
be
up
before
daylight
myself
and
i
reckon
ira
will
be
milking
by
candlelight
she
added
as
she
entered
the
kitchen
door
conway
was
in
the
kitchen
talking
to
amanda
and
edna
hastened
to
show
her
little
hoard
of
tomatoes
we
gathered
a
whole
lot
of
chestnuts
too
she
told
her
mother
they
were
all
on
the
ground
down
the
hill
behind
the
barn
i
know
the
very
tree
conway
told
her
we
must
roast
some
in
the
ashes
this
evening
come
along
supper
is
ready
and
you
must
get
yourself
freshened
up
edna
followed
along
and
in
the
prospect
of
supper
and
then
of
roasting
chestnuts
she
forgot
all
about
the
key
this
by
the
way
was
lying
on
the
where
she
had
dropped
it
a
little
later
on
it
was
picked
up
by
reliance
and
was
slipped
into
the
pocket
of
her
gingham
apron
i
wo
remind
her
that
she
dropped
it
likely
as
not
she
forgot
all
about
it
said
reliance
to
herself
i
ought
not
to
have
trusted
it
to
as
little
a
girl
as
she
is
it
was
not
till
after
she
was
in
bed
that
edna
remembered
that
she
had
ever
had
the
key
where
had
she
put
it
she
had
no
recollection
of
it
after
she
had
swung
it
by
its
string
upon
her
finger
on
the
way
to
the
house
it
must
be
on
the
kitchen
table
she
told
herself
i
opened
my
handkerchief
there
to
show
mother
the
tomatoes
she
sat
up
in
bed
wondering
if
she
would
better
get
up
and
go
down
but
she
finally
decided
to
wait
till
her
mother
should
have
come
to
bed
and
then
confide
in
her
however
try
as
she
would
she
could
not
keep
awake
it
had
been
an
exciting
and
fatiguing
day
and
she
was
in
the
land
of
dreams
in
a
few
minutes
not
even
having
visions
of
keys
or
thanksgiving
dinners
but
of
the
mother
cat
and
her
three
kittens
who
were
climbing
chestnut
trees
and
throwing
down
chestnuts
to
her
chapter
iii
where
the
key
very
very
early
in
the
morning
edna
was
awake
she
was
not
used
to
farmyard
sounds
and
could
not
tell
if
it
were
a
lusty
rooster
an
insistent
or
a
gobbling
turkey
whose
voice
first
reached
her
but
whichever
it
was
she
was
quite
broad
awake
while
it
was
yet
dark
she
lay
still
for
a
few
minutes
with
an
uncertain
feeling
of
something
not
very
pleasant
overshadowing
her
then
she
remembered
the
key
oh
dear
she
sighed
if
they
ca
get
into
the
there
will
be
no
cream
for
breakfast
and
no
butter
either
the
key
must
be
found
she
got
up
and
softly
crept
to
the
window
a
bright
star
hung
low
in
the
sky
and
there
was
the
faintest
hint
of
light
along
the
eastern
horizon
presently
edna
saw
a
lighted
lantern
bobbing
around
down
by
the
stable
and
concluded
that
ira
must
be
up
and
that
it
was
morning
or
at
least
what
meant
morning
to
farmers
she
stood
watching
the
light
grow
in
the
east
and
finally
decided
that
she
would
dress
and
be
all
ready
by
the
time
it
was
light
enough
to
hunt
for
the
lost
key
by
now
she
could
see
well
enough
to
find
her
clothes
but
fearing
lest
she
should
waken
her
mother
she
determined
to
go
to
the
bathroom
at
the
end
of
the
hall
rather
than
use
the
in
the
room
where
she
was
so
she
gathered
up
her
clothing
in
her
arms
and
went
down
the
entry
made
her
toilet
and
crept
down
stairs
there
was
a
light
burning
in
the
lower
hallway
but
it
was
dark
all
through
the
rest
of
the
house
and
she
was
obliged
to
feel
her
way
through
the
rooms
there
was
a
noise
of
some
one
stirring
in
the
pantry
she
opened
the
door
of
the
kitchen
gently
and
peeped
in
a
lamp
was
burning
on
the
table
but
no
key
lay
there
edna
in
quietly
and
felt
on
the
nail
where
the
key
should
hang
thrusting
aside
a
gingham
apron
belonging
to
reliance
which
hung
just
above
its
place
but
the
nail
was
empty
and
she
was
forced
to
believe
she
had
dropped
the
key
somewhere
between
the
and
the
kitchen
she
out
of
the
kitchen
turned
the
key
of
the
outside
door
and
closed
it
after
her
as
noiselessly
as
possible
and
in
another
moment
was
outside
in
the
chill
november
air
it
was
rather
fearsome
to
make
one
way
down
dim
paths
where
some
wild
creature
might
still
be
lurking
after
a
night
raid
from
the
woods
near
by
and
she
imagined
all
sorts
of
things
first
something
stole
softly
by
her
and
was
off
like
a
shot
through
the
tall
weeds
growing
beyond
the
fence
it
was
only
a
rabbit
who
was
more
frightened
at
edna
than
she
at
it
next
the
bushes
parted
and
a
small
white
figure
crept
stealthily
forth
the
child
heart
stood
still
and
she
stopped
short
then
came
a
plaintive
meow
and
she
discovered
one
of
the
three
kittens
out
on
an
adventuring
tour
she
picked
up
the
little
creature
which
purred
contentedly
as
she
snuggled
it
to
her
continuing
her
way
the
garden
left
behind
there
was
the
lane
to
be
passed
through
and
here
some
real
cause
for
fear
in
edna
opinion
for
the
cows
that
ira
had
just
finished
milking
were
coming
through
the
bars
he
had
let
down
they
stumbled
along
clumsily
following
one
another
over
the
rail
and
ambled
on
to
another
set
of
bars
where
they
stood
till
ira
should
let
them
through
at
first
edna
did
not
realize
that
they
were
not
making
for
the
spot
where
she
stood
and
she
took
to
her
heels
fleeing
frantically
back
to
the
garden
banging
the
gate
behind
her
and
standing
still
waiting
till
the
cows
were
through
and
the
bars
up
again
seeing
the
cows
safely
shut
out
from
the
lane
she
ventured
forth
again
and
followed
ira
lantern
to
the
barn
here
she
stood
looking
around
and
presently
the
beams
from
the
lantern
fell
upon
her
little
figure
with
the
white
kitten
still
clasped
in
her
arms
ira
looked
up
in
surprise
hello
he
cried
what
took
you
up
so
airly
why
i
jest
got
through
milkin
and
doggone
it
it
skeerce
light
yit
i
know
said
edna
but
i
had
to
get
up
early
you
see
so
as
to
find
the
key
before
breakfast
key
what
key
the
key
of
the
reliance
gave
it
to
me
to
carry
and
i
was
to
have
hung
it
up
on
a
nail
behind
the
kitchen
door
and
i
forgot
all
about
it
till
i
was
in
bed
you
see
if
it
is
found
nobody
can
have
any
milk
or
cream
for
breakfast
oh
i
guess
we
could
manage
returned
ira
reassuringly
did
drop
it
indoors
did
you
i
do
think
so
i
looked
in
the
kitchen
as
i
came
out
and
i
find
it
there
if
it
had
been
picked
up
it
would
be
on
the
nail
i
should
think
most
likely
it
would
it
would
be
there
sure
if
found
it
she
do
let
nothin
stay
out
of
place
very
long
i
kin
tell
ye
as
long
as
i
did
find
it
in
the
kitchen
i
thought
i
would
come
here
because
i
saw
you
had
a
lantern
and
it
really
is
quite
light
enough
to
see
very
plainly
is
it
no
it
ai
sun
do
rise
till
somewheres
around
seven
this
time
year
well
you
come
with
me
and
we
work
our
way
long
the
path
from
the
and
if
we
do
find
the
key
we
will
go
inside
and
inquire
i
alwuz
find
it
do
do
no
harm
to
ask
questions
and
that
there
key
is
bound
to
be
somewheres
betwixt
this
and
the
house
he
swung
his
lantern
so
its
rays
would
shed
a
broad
light
along
the
way
and
edna
pattered
along
just
behind
him
trying
very
hard
to
keep
up
with
his
long
strides
when
at
last
they
reached
the
he
slackened
his
pace
and
began
carefully
to
look
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
you
come
right
straight
along
did
you
he
questioned
did
go
cavortin
off
nowheres
pickin
weeds
or
chasin
cats
did
you
no
we
came
as
straight
as
could
be
reliance
had
the
butter
and
cream
and
we
did
stop
once
then
i
guess
you
likely
dropped
it
inside
for
i
sarched
careful
and
i
ca
find
it
maybe
when
it
comes
real
bright
daylight
you
could
look
again
but
i
should
advise
askin
at
the
house
next
thing
you
do
he
led
the
way
into
the
kitchen
where
amanda
was
briskly
stirring
about
well
she
began
what
wanting
well
i
declare
if
there
ai
edna
what
got
you
up
so
early
missy
i
guess
you
like
the
rest
of
us
could
sleep
for
thinking
of
all
that
to
do
for
thanksgiving
you
ai
picked
up
the
key
nowheres
about
have
you
asked
ira
why
no
you
had
it
no
i
ai
but
sissy
there
says
gave
it
to
her
to
carry
and
she
ai
no
notion
of
what
she
done
with
it
thought
mebbe
she
might
ha
drapped
it
in
here
she
got
so
worried
over
it
she
riz
from
her
bed
and
come
out
to
hunt
it
up
says
she
was
afraid
nobody
could
get
no
breakfast
because
of
her
losing
of
it
i
guess
we
wo
suffer
for
breakfast
said
amanda
looking
down
kindly
at
the
little
girl
i
do
carry
back
the
milk
nights
this
time
of
year
any
that
left
i
just
set
in
the
pantry
and
there
is
what
was
left
from
supper
this
blessed
minute
butter
too
and
cream
plenty
for
breakfast
you
just
rest
your
mind
on
that
score
but
said
edna
you
will
want
a
whole
lot
of
things
for
the
thanksgiving
cooking
and
what
will
you
do
with
them
all
locked
up
ira
laughed
be
such
an
awful
job
to
lift
the
door
from
its
hinges
and
if
a
body
was
right
spry
he
could
climb
in
at
the
window
after
he
prised
it
open
and
the
things
could
be
handed
out
besides
we
got
all
the
morning
milk
and
there
be
the
night
milk
and
milk
so
i
do
see
that
we
sha
get
along
there
is
more
than
one
way
out
of
that
trouble
ai
there
i
should
say
so
wait
till
the
sun
real
high
and
i
guess
we
find
the
key
fast
enough
she
said
to
edna
now
you
stay
right
here
and
do
go
running
about
in
the
cold
you
be
down
sick
traipsing
about
in
the
wet
grass
and
then
where
will
your
thanksgiving
be
thus
warned
edna
was
content
to
stay
in
the
kitchen
into
which
the
morning
light
was
beginning
to
creep
and
which
was
already
warm
from
the
big
stove
in
a
few
minutes
reliance
appeared
from
the
next
room
where
she
had
been
setting
the
table
she
was
much
astonished
to
learn
that
edna
had
been
down
before
her
what
in
the
world
did
you
get
up
so
soon
for
she
asked
to
find
the
key
edna
answered
and
then
told
her
all
about
the
search
ending
up
with
you
have
seen
anything
of
it
have
you
reliance
reliance
face
broadened
into
a
smile
as
for
answer
she
went
behind
the
kitchen
door
and
produced
the
key
from
its
nail
holding
it
up
to
view
why
where
in
the
world
did
you
get
it
inquired
edna
in
a
tone
of
surprise
it
was
on
the
nail
when
i
looked
there
for
it
a
little
while
ago
you
dropped
it
on
the
last
evening
reliance
told
her
i
found
it
there
and
slipped
it
into
the
pocket
of
my
apron
and
this
morning
when
i
went
to
get
my
apron
there
it
was
so
i
just
hung
it
up
where
it
belonged
well
i
sure
said
amanda
that
easily
explained
who
ha
thought
it
said
ira
well
that
let
us
out
of
another
hunt
i
wo
have
to
wrastle
with
the
door
after
all
will
i
so
after
all
edna
early
rising
was
unnecessary
but
she
did
not
feel
sorry
that
she
had
had
such
an
experience
and
was
content
to
sit
and
watch
amanda
mould
her
biscuits
and
to
help
reliance
finish
setting
the
table
amanda
insisted
upon
giving
her
a
drink
of
buttermilk
from
the
to
which
she
despatched
reliance
advising
edna
not
to
go
this
time
you
had
one
tramp
she
said
and
moreover
you
be
starved
by
breakfast
time
if
you
do
have
something
to
stay
you
the
sausages
were
sizzling
in
the
pan
and
the
griddle
was
ready
for
the
buckwheat
cakes
when
conway
appeared
well
you
did
steal
a
march
on
us
she
said
to
her
little
daughter
how
long
have
you
been
up
i
did
hear
a
sound
you
must
have
been
a
veritable
mouse
to
be
so
quiet
i
been
up
since
before
daylight
edna
told
her
i
took
my
things
into
the
bathroom
so
as
not
to
disturb
you
it
was
lovely
and
warm
in
there
then
again
she
repeated
her
story
of
the
lost
key
reliance
had
the
joke
on
her
said
amanda
for
she
had
the
key
all
the
time
why
did
you
tell
me
you
had
found
it
asked
edna
a
little
reproachfully
as
she
turned
to
reliance
who
had
by
this
time
returned
from
the
i
thought
you
would
forget
all
about
it
and
i
did
think
it
was
worth
while
to
mention
besides
she
added
i
ought
to
have
carried
the
key
myself
anyway
you
right
there
remarked
amanda
it
is
your
especial
charge
and
you
ought
to
have
let
anyone
else
fetch
it
in
moreover
you
ought
to
have
hung
it
up
the
minute
you
found
it
and
there
it
would
have
been
when
it
was
looked
for
oh
do
scold
her
begged
edna
it
was
all
my
fault
really
amanda
smiled
i
do
see
it
just
that
way
folks
had
ought
to
learn
when
they
young
that
in
this
house
there
a
place
for
everything
and
everything
should
be
in
its
place
i
rather
guess
though
that
that
special
key
wo
get
lost
again
right
away
edna
felt
that
she
had
brought
this
lecture
upon
reliance
and
felt
rather
badly
to
have
done
so
but
the
prospect
of
buckwheat
cakes
soon
drove
her
away
and
she
went
in
to
say
good
morning
to
her
grandparents
well
satisfied
with
the
world
in
general
and
content
to
look
ahead
rather
than
at
what
was
now
past
and
gone
and
which
could
not
be
altered
before
the
day
had
far
advanced
came
the
first
of
the
arrivals
aunt
alice
barker
and
her
two
boys
ben
and
willis
ben
and
edna
were
great
chums
though
he
was
the
older
of
the
two
boys
ben
was
alert
full
of
fun
and
ready
to
joke
on
every
occasion
while
willis
was
rather
shy
and
had
not
much
to
say
to
his
little
cousin
whom
by
the
way
he
did
not
know
so
very
well
edna
would
fain
have
spent
the
morning
in
the
kitchen
from
which
issued
delectable
odors
but
amanda
had
declared
she
wanted
all
the
room
there
was
that
she
had
scatted
out
the
cats
and
dogs
and
she
would
have
to
scat
out
children
too
if
they
came
bothering
around
therefore
to
avoid
this
catastrophe
edna
took
herself
to
a
different
part
of
the
house
and
was
standing
at
one
of
the
front
windows
when
the
carriage
drove
up
oh
grandpa
she
sang
out
here
come
aunt
alice
and
her
boys
hurry
hurry
or
they
will
get
here
before
we
can
be
there
to
meet
them
her
grandfather
threw
down
his
newspaper
and
laid
aside
his
spectacles
well
well
he
said
it
takes
the
young
eyes
to
find
out
who
is
coming
i
did
suppose
allie
would
be
here
till
afternoon
what
team
have
they
why
did
they
let
us
know
so
we
could
send
for
them
he
followed
edna
who
was
already
at
the
front
door
tugging
at
the
bolt
then
in
another
moment
the
two
were
out
on
the
porch
while
yet
the
carriage
was
some
yards
away
ben
caught
sight
of
them
hello
he
cried
out
here
we
are
bag
and
baggage
did
expect
us
so
soon
did
you
grandpa
no
son
we
did
how
did
you
come
to
steal
a
march
on
us
in
this
way
the
express
was
behind
time
so
we
caught
it
at
the
junction
instead
of
having
to
wait
for
the
train
we
expected
to
take
it
did
seem
worth
while
to
telephone
in
fact
we
did
have
time
so
we
just
got
this
team
from
mayville
and
here
we
are
how
are
you
pinky
blooms
he
darted
at
edna
tousled
her
hair
picked
her
up
and
slung
her
over
his
shoulder
as
if
she
were
a
bag
of
meal
and
dropped
her
on
the
top
step
of
the
porch
she
laughing
and
protesting
the
while
oh
ben
she
panted
you
are
perfectly
dreadful
why
is
that
you
edna
said
ben
in
pretended
surprise
i
thought
you
were
my
valise
it
is
too
bad
i
made
the
mistake
and
dumped
you
down
so
unceremoniously
edna
knew
perfectly
well
how
to
take
this
so
she
picked
herself
up
laughing
and
started
after
ben
who
leaped
over
the
railing
of
the
porch
thus
making
his
escape
by
this
time
willis
and
conway
had
come
out
and
the
whole
company
went
indoors
ben
the
last
to
come
peeping
in
through
a
crack
of
the
door
and
then
slinking
in
with
a
pretense
of
being
afraid
of
edna
an
hour
later
these
two
were
tramping
over
the
place
hand
in
hand
making
all
sorts
of
discoveries
leaving
willis
deep
in
a
book
and
the
older
people
chatting
cozily
before
the
open
fire
aunt
emmeline
uncle
wilbur
and
becky
were
the
next
to
come
becky
being
in
a
pout
because
her
sweetheart
had
failed
to
make
the
train
and
aunt
emmeline
fussing
and
arguing
with
her
you
know
becky
that
he
is
coming
and
i
do
see
what
difference
a
couple
of
hours
will
make
she
said
as
she
gave
her
hand
to
her
sister
willis
i
am
just
telling
becky
cecelia
that
she
is
very
foolish
to
make
such
a
fuss
because
howard
is
detained
he
missed
the
train
you
see
and
ca
arrive
till
the
next
comes
in
she
passed
on
into
the
house
still
talking
while
edna
made
her
escape
upstairs
she
had
not
noticed
the
little
girl
and
edna
felt
rather
slighted
however
this
was
all
forgotten
a
little
later
when
her
own
brothers
and
sister
as
well
as
her
father
were
to
be
welcomed
you
would
suppose
edna
had
been
parted
from
them
for
at
least
a
year
so
joyous
were
her
greetings
and
so
much
did
she
have
to
tell
she
had
scarcely
unburdened
herself
of
all
her
happenings
before
in
swarmed
uncle
bert
and
his
family
there
was
so
many
of
these
that
for
a
little
while
they
seemed
to
fill
the
entire
house
for
first
appeared
aunt
lucia
and
after
her
the
nurse
carrying
the
baby
then
uncle
bert
with
little
herbert
in
his
arms
and
then
lulie
and
allen
and
ted
cousin
becky
sweetheart
howard
colby
came
on
the
last
train
and
ended
the
list
of
guests
what
a
houseful
it
was
to
be
sure
and
what
long
long
tables
in
the
reliance
was
not
able
to
wait
on
everybody
and
so
niece
fanny
took
a
hand
thus
everyone
was
served
edna
was
rather
shy
of
those
cousins
whom
she
had
not
seen
for
two
or
three
years
and
after
supper
preferred
to
stay
close
to
her
sister
celia
and
ben
though
her
brothers
were
soon
with
allen
and
ted
and
were
planning
expeditions
for
the
morrow
ben
told
such
a
funny
story
about
the
lady
by
the
willow
tree
that
edna
could
never
look
at
the
picture
again
without
laughing
but
he
had
scarcely
finished
it
before
some
one
called
out
bedtime
for
little
folks
and
all
the
younger
ones
trooped
off
upstairs
grandma
herself
leading
the
way
to
see
that
each
one
was
tucked
in
comfortably
chapter
iv
a
hearty
dinner
it
would
be
quite
a
task
if
one
were
to
try
to
compute
the
number
of
buckwheat
cakes
consumed
at
the
long
tables
the
next
morning
and
there
might
have
been
more
but
that
charlie
stopped
frank
in
the
act
of
helping
himself
to
a
further
supply
by
saying
look
here
son
if
you
keep
on
eating
cakes
you
wo
give
your
thanksgiving
dinner
any
show
at
all
i
thinking
about
that
turkey
this
remark
was
passed
down
the
table
and
had
the
effect
of
bringing
the
breakfast
to
a
conclusion
the
boys
scampered
off
out
of
doors
to
scour
the
place
for
nuts
or
to
dive
into
unfrequented
woodsy
places
while
the
girls
gathered
around
the
crowing
baby
in
high
with
herself
and
the
world
at
large
then
the
nurse
bore
baby
off
and
edna
turned
to
her
mother
for
advice
what
can
i
do
mother
she
asked
why
let
me
see
your
aunt
alice
and
i
are
going
to
help
your
grandma
to
arrange
the
tables
after
a
while
we
shall
want
a
lot
of
decorations
besides
the
roses
your
uncle
bert
brought
suppose
you
little
girls
constitute
yourselves
an
order
of
flower
girls
with
celia
at
your
head
and
go
out
to
find
whatever
may
do
for
the
tables
there
are
some
chrysanthemums
little
yellow
ones
and
there
are
a
few
white
ones
too
i
saw
them
yesterday
down
by
the
fence
they
will
do
nicely
we
will
have
those
and
anything
else
that
will
be
pretty
for
the
table
or
the
rooms
shall
we
ask
lulie
to
go
with
us
whispered
edna
certainly
i
would
she
is
quite
so
old
as
you
but
she
is
the
only
other
little
girl
here
and
it
would
be
very
rude
and
unkind
to
leave
her
out
you
ask
her
continued
edna
in
a
low
tone
for
answer
conway
smiled
over
at
lulie
do
you
want
to
be
a
flower
girl
she
asked
celia
i
propose
that
you
take
these
two
little
girls
in
tow
and
go
on
an
expedition
to
gather
flowers
to
deck
the
tables
and
the
house
i
know
you
will
enjoy
it
indeed
i
shall
replied
celia
come
on
girls
let
see
what
we
can
find
and
the
three
sallied
forth
to
discover
what
might
be
of
use
an
hour
later
they
came
back
laden
with
small
branches
of
scarlet
oak
with
graceful
weeds
with
the
little
buttony
chrysanthemums
and
with
actually
a
few
late
roses
which
had
braved
the
frost
and
were
showing
pale
faces
in
a
sheltered
corner
when
the
girls
came
upon
them
by
this
time
the
three
cousins
were
well
acquainted
the
two
younger
the
best
friends
possible
so
that
when
dinner
was
really
ready
they
were
quite
happy
at
being
allowed
to
sit
side
by
side
it
would
fill
a
whole
chapter
if
i
were
to
tell
you
about
all
the
good
things
on
that
table
grandpa
carved
a
huge
brown
turkey
at
one
end
while
uncle
bert
carved
an
equally
huge
and
brown
one
at
the
other
end
grandma
served
the
flakiest
of
noble
at
her
side
of
the
table
while
aunt
alice
served
an
of
the
same
proportions
and
quite
as
delicious
the
boys
not
in
the
least
disturbed
by
the
memory
of
the
buckwheat
cakes
were
ready
with
appetites
while
the
girls
after
their
scramble
in
search
of
decorations
had
no
reason
to
complain
of
not
being
hungry
to
cousin
becky
lot
fell
one
of
the
wishbones
and
to
edna
joy
she
had
the
other
cousin
becky
put
hers
up
over
the
front
door
after
dinner
and
it
was
the
strangest
thing
in
the
world
that
howard
colby
should
be
the
first
to
come
in
afterward
edna
decided
to
save
hers
till
it
was
entirely
dry
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
then
asked
lulie
i
have
quite
decided
i
shall
take
it
home
and
maybe
i
pull
it
with
dorothy
or
maybe
i
will
make
a
of
it
for
a
christmas
gift
i
might
give
it
to
ben
i
never
heard
of
wishbone
said
lulie
are
they
very
hard
to
make
not
so
very
if
you
have
anyone
to
help
you
with
the
head
celia
could
help
me
with
that
you
make
a
head
you
know
and
then
the
wishbone
has
two
legs
and
you
dress
it
up
so
it
is
a
this
was
not
a
very
clear
description
but
lulie
was
satisfied
especially
as
at
that
moment
ben
came
to
them
and
said
that
everyone
was
going
to
play
games
in
order
that
their
dinners
might
properly
digest
everybody
inquired
lulie
the
grandparents
too
of
course
ben
told
her
we
are
going
to
begin
with
something
easy
like
forfeits
and
work
up
to
the
real
snappy
ones
after
what
are
the
snappy
ones
asked
edna
oh
things
like
and
lively
things
that
will
keep
us
on
the
jump
the
two
little
girls
followed
ben
into
the
next
room
and
before
long
everyone
was
trying
to
escape
from
grandpa
who
was
as
eager
for
a
game
of
blind
man
buff
as
anybody
and
who
at
last
caught
becky
who
in
turn
caught
howard
colby
because
he
did
try
to
get
out
of
her
way
this
ended
that
game
but
everybody
was
so
warmed
up
to
the
fun
that
when
it
was
proposed
to
carry
on
a
game
of
hide
and
seek
out
of
doors
all
agreed
and
edna
was
so
convulsed
with
laughter
to
see
her
dignified
wilbur
crouching
behind
a
and
peeping
fearfully
over
the
top
that
she
forgot
to
hide
herself
properly
and
was
discovered
by
ben
in
a
moment
you
no
good
at
all
at
hiding
ben
told
her
anybody
could
have
found
you
with
half
an
eye
oh
i
do
care
replied
edna
i
have
just
as
much
fun
finding
out
some
one
else
and
she
it
was
who
made
straight
for
uncle
to
which
he
had
returned
with
the
fond
belief
of
its
serving
as
good
a
turn
a
second
time
it
was
not
so
very
long
before
the
older
persons
declared
that
they
had
had
enough
of
it
the
men
returned
to
the
house
to
have
a
smoke
and
the
ladies
to
chat
around
the
fire
as
for
the
children
it
was
quite
too
much
to
expect
them
to
go
in
while
there
was
a
twinkle
of
daylight
left
and
as
amanda
expressed
it
they
took
the
place
the
girls
did
not
roam
far
from
the
house
but
the
boys
wandered
much
further
afield
bringing
caps
and
pockets
full
of
nuts
and
clothes
full
of
burs
and
even
ben
brought
back
a
hoard
of
persimmons
touched
by
the
frost
and
as
sweet
as
honey
he
poured
these
out
on
a
flat
stone
near
which
edna
was
standing
come
here
edna
he
said
let
divvy
up
i
give
you
half
you
can
take
what
you
do
eat
to
your
mother
and
i
take
what
i
do
eat
to
my
mother
edna
squatted
down
by
the
stone
and
began
delicately
to
nibble
at
the
fruit
which
still
bore
its
soft
purple
bloom
i
do
believe
i
shall
eat
very
many
she
said
for
my
dinner
is
still
lasting
and
there
will
be
supper
before
i
am
ready
for
it
we
are
not
going
to
have
a
real
regular
supper
because
grandma
thinks
amanda
and
reliance
should
have
some
holiday
too
but
we
are
going
to
have
sandwiches
and
cakes
and
nuts
and
apples
and
cider
and
a
whole
lot
of
things
something
like
a
party
you
know
are
you
going
to
eat
any
of
your
persimmons
ben
no
that
coming
supper
party
sounds
too
seductive
i
wait
so
that
i
can
do
it
justice
what
did
you
see
out
in
the
woods
asked
edna
foxy
and
bare
trees
he
answered
promptly
do
you
mean
trees
or
trees
which
ever
you
like
i
no
doubt
there
were
both
kinds
oh
ben
edna
glanced
around
fearfully
do
you
really
think
there
are
bears
around
here
i
know
there
are
sometimes
he
drew
down
his
mouth
in
a
way
which
made
edna
suspect
a
joke
when
is
the
sometimes
she
asked
suspiciously
when
they
have
a
circus
at
mayville
oh
you
ben
barker
you
are
the
worst
cried
edna
roguishly
pulling
his
nose
here
here
he
exclaimed
look
out
it
might
come
off
like
the
tail
what
fox
do
you
know
the
story
of
the
fox
it
is
in
one
of
those
big
red
books
that
lie
on
that
table
in
the
here
in
this
house
yea
verily
you
do
mean
to
say
you
have
never
read
those
books
why
there
is
not
a
year
since
i
was
eight
years
old
that
i
pored
over
them
every
time
i
have
been
here
and
that
is
at
least
once
a
year
i
go
for
those
books
i
advise
you
to
make
their
acquaintance
you
tell
me
the
story
then
i
wo
have
to
read
it
no
my
child
i
shall
not
allow
you
to
neglect
your
opportunities
through
any
weakness
on
my
part
read
it
for
yourself
and
thereafter
the
red
book
will
be
one
of
your
prized
memories
of
then
tell
me
again
about
the
lady
and
the
willow
tree
begged
edna
that
was
so
funny
ben
laughed
i
am
afraid
i
do
remember
that
so
well
as
i
do
the
fox
story
but
maybe
i
will
think
of
some
more
about
her
come
it
is
time
to
go
in
they
may
be
eating
those
chicken
or
turkey
sandwiches
this
very
minute
hanging
on
his
arm
edna
skipped
along
to
the
house
to
find
that
it
was
quite
too
early
to
think
of
sandwiches
though
the
lamps
were
lighted
in
all
but
the
where
a
cheerful
fire
made
the
place
light
enough
around
the
fire
sat
grandma
aunt
emmeline
aunt
alice
and
conway
aunt
lucia
was
upstairs
with
the
babies
uncle
wilbur
was
taking
a
nap
and
grandpa
and
uncle
bert
were
out
looking
after
the
stock
as
ira
and
the
other
man
had
been
allowed
a
holiday
over
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
sat
cousin
becky
and
her
lover
talking
in
low
tones
dear
me
said
grandma
as
the
children
all
trooped
in
we
must
have
a
light
these
little
folks
may
not
like
to
sit
in
the
dark
this
is
the
best
kind
of
light
declared
ben
and
the
very
time
for
telling
tales
let
all
sit
around
the
fire
and
have
a
good
time
begin
with
the
oldest
and
so
on
down
to
the
youngest
if
we
do
have
time
to
go
all
the
way
down
the
line
we
stop
when
we
hungry
how
that
grandma
do
you
like
the
plan
it
is
just
as

others

lovely
plan

will
have

begin
mother
and
aunt
emmeline

that
lady
i
never
was
one
for
telling
tales
you
will
have
to
count
me
out
i
am
sure
if
i
can
you
can
grandma
assured
her
what
shall
it
be
about
children
oh
about
when
you
were
a
little
girl
cried
edna
about
the
time
the
horse
ran
away
with
you
spoke
up
the
boys
about
your
first
ball
please
begged
celia
grandma
laughed
just
listen
to
them
they
have
heard
all
those
things
dozens
of
times
i
tell
you
what
we
will
do
i
will
tell
about
the
runaway
horse
that
belongs
to
the
time
when
i
was
a
little
girl
and
emmeline
shall
tell
about
her
first
ball
and
i
can
remind
her
if
she
forgets
anything
i
remember
her
first
ball
even
better
than
my
first
for
it
was
at
hers
i
met
your
grandfather
this
was
all
so
satisfactory
that
there
was
not
a
murmur
of
dissent
and
grandma
began
it
was
when
i
was
about
ten
years
old
that
i
went
one
day
with
my
father
to
the
nearest
village
he
was
driving
a
pair
of
spirited
horses
and
on
our
way
home
a
parcel
we
were
bringing
home
fell
out
of
the
buggy
my
father
stopped
the
horses
and
ran
back
to
pick
up
the
parcel
but
before
he
could
get
to
the
buggy
the
horses
took
fright
at
a
piece
of
paper
blowing
along
the
road
in
front
of
them
and
off
they
started
full
tilt
down
the
road
in
vain
my
father
cried
there
whoa
barney
whoa
pet
on
they
went
faster
and
faster
i
managed
to
hold
on
to
the
reins
but
my
young
hands
were
not
strong
enough
to
control
the
wild
creatures
and
i
thought
every
minute
would
be
my
last
for
up
hill
and
down
dale
we
went
at
such
a
pace
i
had
never
known
over
a
stump
would
jounce
the
buggy
and
i
would
nearly
pitch
out
around
the
last
curve
they
went
with
a
swing
which
i
thought
would
land
me
on
my
back
or
my
head
but
i
managed
to
keep
my
seat
and
at
last
saw
the
open
gate
of
our
own
lane
before
me
would
the
horses
go
through
without
hitting
a
gate
post
would
they
run
into
a
fence
or
over
a
pile
of
stones
at
one
side
my
heart
was
in
my
mouth
i
jerked
the
reins
in
a
vain
attempt
to
guide
them
but
on
they
went
making
straight
for
the
open
gate
presently
i
saw
some
one
rush
from
the
house
and
then
another
person
come
flying
from
the
stables
just
before
we
reached
the
gate
it
was
flung
to
with
a
bang
the
horses
pranced
swung
a
little
to
one
side
and
stopped
short
and
i
heard
some
one
say
barney
so
pet
i
did
know
what
happened
next
but
the
first
thing
i
knew
i
was
lying
on
the
lounge
in
the
my
mother
bending
over
me
and
holding
a
bottle
of
salts
to
my
nose
dear
oh
dear
my
mother
was
crying
minute
and
the
child
might
have
been
killed
who
was
it
shut
the
gate
asked
allen
eagerly
amanda
mother
who
was
living
with
us
at
that
time
and
who
caught
the
horses
queried
ted
jim
doughty
who
was
our
hired
man
were
you
nearly
frightened
to
death
lulie
put
the
question
very
nearly
and
so
was
my
father
he
was
as
pale
as
a
ghost
when
he
got
home
he
had
to
walk
all
the
way
and
said
he
thought
he
should
never
get
there
the
country
was
as
thickly
settled
as
it
is
now
and
there
were
no
houses
between
us
and
the
spot
where
the
horses
took
fright
where
is
the
place
you
lived
asked
allen
about
five
miles
from
here
i
should
like
to
see
it
said
the
boy
musingly
i
suppose
those
horses
are
dead
i
like
to
see
horses
that
could
run
like
that
they
would
be
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
or
seventy
years
old
by
this
time
said
grandma
with
a
smile
and
the
oldest
horse
i
ever
knew
was
forty
gee
but
that
was
old
remarked
frank
whose
was
it
grandma
yours
no
my
grandfather
her
name
was
dolly
and
she
took
my
grandparents
to
church
every
sunday
for
many
years
up
to
a
little
while
before
she
died
now
emmeline
let
hear
about
the
ball
it
was
just
a
ball
began
aunt
emmeline
the
county
ball
put
in
grandma
they
always
have
one
every
year
at
fair
time
emmeline
was
sixteen
and
i
was
eighteen
now
go
on
emmeline
i
wore
white
tarlatan
trimmed
with
said
aunt
emmeline
and
i
danced
my
first
dance
with
steve
hardesty
she
paused
and
gave
a
little
sigh
he
took
me
into
supper
too
poor
steve
grandma
leaned
over
and
laid
her
hand
softly
on
her
sister
it
is
such
a
long
time
such
a
very
long
time
ago
she
said
softly
aunt
emmeline
smiled
a
little
sadly
yes
a
long
time
she
repeated
you
wore
what
was
it
you
wore
cecelia
i
wore
pink
tarlatan
trimmed
with
rosebuds
and
a
wreath
of
them
in
my
hair
the
skirt
was
caught
up
with
bunches
of
the
little
buds
and
green
leaves
and
i
thought
it
the
prettiest
dress
i
ever
saw
it
was
a
great
ball
aunt
emmeline
went
on
brightening
i
danced
every
set
and
so
did
you
cecelia
and
how
everyone
did
talk
because
i
danced
so
many
with
ben
willis
whom
i
had
met
for
the
first
time
that
night
he
would
see
me
home
you
remember
although
uncle
phil
and
cousin
dick
were
both
there
to
look
after
us
we
were
staying
at
our
uncle
my
dears
it
was
during
the
early
days
of
the
war
and
there
was
much
talk
of
what
would
happen
next
and
who
would
be
going
off
to
join
the
army
you
remember
it
was
not
till
two
years
after
that
steve
went
said
aunt
emmeline
wistfully
tell
us
about
steve
spoke
up
frank
did
he
become
a
soldier
celia
shook
her
head
warningly
at
her
little
brother
for
she
knew
aunt
emmeline
story
and
of
how
her
young
lover
was
killed
in
battle
but
aunt
emmeline
did
not
hesitate
to
answer
yes
he
went
but
he
never
came
back
silence
fell
upon
the
little
group
for
a
moment
till
aunt
emmeline
herself
broke
it
by
saying
do
you
remember
cecelia
how
angry
you
were
with
polly
parker
because
she
copied
your
dress
and
how
you
were
going
to
have
yours
trimmed
with
daisies
and
changed
all
that
at
the
last
moment
i
can
see
you
now
ripping
off
those
inoffensive
daisies
and
flinging
them
on
the
floor
grandma
laughed
well
after
all
hers
was
a
bit
like
mine
for
it
was
a
different
shade
of
pink
and
was
made
the
same
way
yes
i
was
furious
i
remember
because
it
was
the
first
time
polly
had
copied
my
things
she
had
a
way
of
doing
it
here
comes
grandpa
announced
herbert
who
did
not
find
all
this
talk
of
dress
and
balls
very
interesting
the
entrance
of
grandpa
and
uncle
bert
broke
up
the
party
by
the
fire
for
soon
the
sandwiches
and
other
things
were
brought
in
then
came
songs
and
games
till
before
anyone
realized
it
bedtime
came
and
thanksgiving
day
was
over
chapter
v
the
red
book
whether
it
was
the
search
for
the
key
in
the
chill
of
the
early
morning
or
whether
it
was
that
she
ate
too
heartily
of
grandma
good
things
certain
it
was
that
when
edna
waked
up
the
morning
after
thanksgiving
she
felt
very
listless
and
miserable
her
father
was
already
up
and
dressed
and
her
mother
was
making
her
toilet
when
the
little
girl
turned
over
and
watched
her
with
heavy
eyes
well
little
girl
said
conway
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
time
for
you
to
get
up
edna
gave
a
long
sigh
closed
her
eyes
but
presently
found
the
courage
to
make
an
effort
towards
rising
she
threw
aside
the
covers
slipped
her
feet
into
her
red
worsted
slippers
and
then
sat
on
the
side
of
her
cot
in
so
dejected
an
attitude
that
her
mother
noticed
it
what
she
said
are
you
so
very
sleepy
still
i
suspect
you
are
tired
out
from
yesterday
doings
my
head
aches
and
there
are
cold
creeps
running
up
and
down
my
back
edna
told
her
her
mother
came
nearer
and
laid
her
cool
hand
on
the
throbbing
temples
your
head
is
hot
she
declared
i
am
afraid
you
have
taken
cold
cuddle
back
under
the
covers
and
i
will
bring
or
send
your
breakfast
up
to
you
i
do
think
i
want
any
breakfast
said
edna
snuggling
down
with
a
grateful
feeling
for
the
warmth
and
quiet
not
want
any
breakfast
then
you
certainly
are
well
when
waffles
and
fried
chicken
can
not
tempt
you
i
know
something
is
wrong
conway
went
on
with
the
finishing
touches
to
her
dress
and
hair
while
edna
dozed
but
half
conscious
of
what
was
going
on
around
her
she
did
not
hear
her
mother
leave
the
room
and
did
not
know
how
long
it
was
before
she
heard
celia
voice
saying
mother
says
you
better
try
to
drink
this
this
was
a
cup
of
hot
milk
of
which
edna
tried
to
take
a
few
sips
and
then
lay
back
on
her
pillow
i
do
want
it
she
said
poor
little
sister
said
celia
commiseratingly
it
is
too
bad
you
do
feel
well
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
no
thank
you
replied
edna
weakly
mother
is
coming
up
in
a
minute
celia
went
on
uncle
bert
and
all
of
them
are
going
this
morning
but
as
soon
as
they
are
off
she
will
come
up
to
see
how
you
are
is
everyone
going
asked
edna
languidly
no
not
this
morning
uncle
bert
and
his
family
take
the
morning
train
because
they
have
the
furthest
to
go
and
aunt
lucia
wants
to
get
home
with
the
children
before
dark
uncle
wilbur
aunt
emmeline
and
all
those
are
going
on
the
afternoon
train
father
thinks
he
must
get
back
too
edna
made
no
answer
but
closed
her
eyes
again
drowsily
i
set
the
milk
down
here
celia
went
on
and
maybe
you
will
feel
like
drinking
some
more
of
it
after
a
little
while
she
set
the
cup
on
a
chair
by
edna
bedside
and
stole
softly
out
of
the
room
leaving
her
sister
to
fall
into
another
doze
from
which
she
was
awakened
by
hearing
a
timid
voice
say
excuse
me
i
hope
you
are
not
asleep
but
i
want
to
say
and
turning
over
edna
saw
her
little
cousin
lulie
oh
are
you
going
came
from
the
little
girl
in
bed
yes
we
are
all
ready
i
am
so
sorry
you
are
sick
i
like
you
so
much
and
i
wish
you
would
come
to
our
house
some
day
edna
was
too
polite
not
to
make
some
effort
of
appreciation
so
she
sat
up
and
held
out
her
little
hot
hand
oh
thank
you
she
answered
i
should
love
to
come
and
i
wish
you
could
come
to
see
us
ask
uncle
bert
to
bring
you
real
soon
mother
said
i
had
better
not
kiss
you
remarked
lulie
honestly
for
i
might
take
your
cold
but
i
have
folded
up
a
kiss
in
this
piece
of
paper
and
i
will
put
it
here
so
you
can
get
it
when
i
am
gone
edna
smiled
at
this
and
liked
lulie
all
the
better
for
the
fancy
i
wo
forget
it
she
said
earnestly
i
will
send
you
one
when
i
get
well
but
you
better
not
take
a
feverish
one
with
you
and
say
to
all
the
others
they
would
have
come
too
lulie
informed
her
but
mother
thought
one
of
us
was
enough
when
you
had
a
headache
and
that
i
could
bring
all
the
for
the
others
now
i
must
go
get
well
soon
and
she
was
off
leaving
edna
with
a
consciousness
of
it
being
a
wise
decree
which
prevented
more
visitors
for
her
headache
was
so
much
the
worse
for
having
had
but
one
she
lay
very
still
wishing
the
noises
below
would
cease
the
running
back
and
forth
the
shutting
of
doors
the
calling
of
the
boys
to
one
another
and
the
crying
of
the
baby
but
last
of
all
she
heard
the
carriage
wheels
on
the
gravel
and
then
it
was
suddenly
silent
the
boys
had
all
gone
off
to
play
and
the
only
sounds
were
occasional
footsteps
on
the
stair
the
stirring
of
the
kitchen
fire
and
outside
the
distant
caw
caw
of
the
crows
in
the
trees
for
a
long
time
she
was
very
quiet
once
her
mother
came
to
the
door
and
peeped
in
but
seeing
no
movement
believed
the
child
asleep
but
later
she
came
in
and
edna
opened
her
eyes
to
see
her
standing
by
her
bedside
poor
little
lass
said
her
mother
you
not
feeling
well
at
all
are
you
i
am
afraid
you
have
a
little
fever
i
will
give
you
something
that
i
hope
will
make
you
feel
better
not
any
nasty
medicine
begged
edna
no
only
some
tiny
tablets
that
you
can
swallow
right
down
with
a
little
water
she
went
to
the
bureau
and
found
the
little
phial
she
was
in
search
of
after
shaking
out
a
few
pellets
in
her
hand
she
brought
them
to
edna
with
a
glass
of
water
and
the
child
took
the
dose
obediently
for
she
knew
these
small
tablets
of
old
now
conway
went
on
i
will
cover
you
up
warm
and
you
must
try
to
get
to
sleep
grandma
is
trying
to
keep
the
house
quiet
and
ben
has
taken
off
the
boys
i
am
going
to
tidy
up
the
room
and
stay
here
with
you
for
awhile
there
now
you
will
be
more
comfortable
that
way
and
under
her
mother
loving
touches
edna
felt
happier
already
and
in
a
short
time
fell
into
a
sound
sleep
from
which
she
awakened
feeling
brighter
her
mother
was
sitting
by
the
window
crocheting
where
the
sun
was
streaming
in
edna
sat
up
and
pushed
back
the
hair
from
her
face
her
mother
noticed
the
movement
well
dearie
she
said
you
have
had
a
nice
nap
and
i
hope
you
feel
ever
so
much
better
yes
i
think
i
do
said
the
child
a
little
doubtfully
that
was
a
very
enthusiastic
voice
you
ca
be
sure
about
it
yes
i
can
i
do
feel
a
great
deal
better
and
as
if
you
would
like
a
little
something
to
eat
why
what
could
i
eat
how
would
some
milk
toast
and
a
egg
do
i
like
milk
toast
pretty
well
but
i
do
believe
i
want
the
egg
not
when
it
will
be
freshly
laid
this
morning
i
could
have
it
fried
i
suppose
better
not
i
tell
you
what
i
will
do
i
will
go
down
and
ask
grandma
what
she
thinks
would
be
best
for
you
would
you
like
to
sit
up
in
bed
i
can
put
something
over
your
shoulders
and
prop
you
up
with
pillows
or
how
would
you
like
to
get
into
my
bed
there
is
more
room
and
you
can
look
out
of
the
window
i
will
bundle
you
up
and
carry
you
over
i
like
that
returned
edna
in
a
satisfied
tone
it
was
always
a
treat
to
get
into
mother
bed
conway
turned
down
the
covers
of
her
own
bed
slipped
edna
into
her
flannel
wrapper
threw
a
shawl
around
her
and
carried
her
across
the
room
to
deposit
her
in
the
big
bed
there
she
said
you
can
keep
your
wrapper
on
till
you
get
quite
warm
let
me
put
this
pillow
behind
your
back
that
it
now
then
how
do
you
like
the
change
oh
i
like
it
edna
assured
her
and
my
head
is
much
better
i
think
you
better
stay
in
bed
however
for
we
want
to
break
up
that
cold
there
is
no
better
way
to
do
it
than
to
keep
you
in
bed
for
at
least
now
i
will
go
down
and
interview
grandma
she
left
the
room
and
edna
heard
her
talking
to
some
one
in
the
entry
then
the
door
opened
and
grandma
herself
came
in
good
morning
dear
child
she
said
i
wanted
to
come
up
before
but
it
seemed
best
to
keep
you
quiet
i
am
so
glad
to
hear
that
you
are
feeling
better
but
you
must
be
careful
not
to
take
more
cold
would
you
like
to
have
serena
to
keep
you
company
oh
i
should
like
her
very
much
returned
edna
her
grandmother
left
the
room
returning
presently
with
an
doll
which
had
been
hers
when
she
was
a
little
girl
the
doll
was
dressed
in
the
fashion
of
sixty
years
ago
and
was
quite
a
different
creature
from
edna
virginia
she
always
liked
serena
in
spite
of
her
black
corkscrew
curls
and
staring
blue
eyes
whenever
she
visited
overlea
serena
was
given
to
her
to
play
with
as
a
special
privilege
her
grandma
knew
that
edna
was
careful
but
she
would
not
have
brought
out
this
relic
of
her
childhood
for
everyone
i
will
put
this
little
shawl
around
her
before
you
take
her
for
she
has
been
in
a
cooler
room
and
it
might
chill
you
to
touch
her
said
grandma
as
she
wound
a
small
worsted
shawl
over
serena
blue
silk
frock
i
will
put
her
on
the
bed
there
right
by
you
and
then
i
will
go
down
to
see
if
amanda
has
anything
that
is
fit
for
a
little
invalid
to
eat
she
kissed
the
top
of
head
and
went
out
leaving
her
to
serena
company
it
was
not
long
before
edna
heard
some
one
coming
slowly
up
the
stair
then
there
was
a
pause
before
the
door
next
a
knock
and
second
pause
before
edna
come
in
was
answered
by
reliance
who
carefully
bore
a
tray
on
which
stood
several
covered
dishes
i
asked
willis
to
please
let
me
bring
this
up
said
reliance
i
am
so
sorry
you
are
sick
i
am
dreadfully
afraid
you
took
cold
hunting
that
key
oh
i
do
suppose
it
was
that
edna
tried
to
reassure
her
i
might
have
taken
cold
yesterday
for
i
got
so
warm
running
when
we
were
playing
oh
how
lovely
reliance
you
have
brought
up
grandma
dear
little
dishes
that
were
given
her
when
she
was
a
little
girl
i
love
those
little
dishes
with
the
flowers
on
them
you
to
eat
this
first
said
reliance
uncovering
a
small
tureen
in
which
some
delicious
chicken
broth
was
steaming
there
is
toast
to
go
with
it
then
if
you
feel
as
if
you
wanted
any
more
there
is
a
little
piece
of
cold
turkey
and
some
jelly
but
in
spite
of
her
belief
that
she
could
eat
every
bit
of
what
was
before
her
edna
could
do
no
more
than
manage
the
broth
and
one
piece
of
toast
reliance
watching
her
solicitously
while
she
ate
you
not
very
peckish
are
you
she
said
well
anyhow
i
am
glad
this
come
on
before
you
had
your
thanksgiving
it
would
have
been
dreadful
if
it
had
happened
yesterday
i
am
glad
too
returned
edna
what
time
is
it
reliance
it
most
dinner
time
as
soon
as
the
boys
come
in
it
will
be
ready
i
take
back
the
tray
but
i
have
to
go
awful
careful
for
i
would
sooner
break
my
leg
than
these
dishes
she
bore
off
the
tray
as
edna
snuggled
back
against
her
pillows
holding
one
of
serena
kid
hands
in
hers
in
order
that
she
might
feel
less
alone
she
was
not
left
long
to
serena
sole
company
however
for
first
came
her
father
to
say
then
aunt
emmeline
stopped
at
the
door
and
behind
her
cousin
becky
and
uncle
wilbur
all
ready
with
sympathy
and
good
wishes
a
little
later
she
heard
the
carriage
drive
off
which
should
take
all
these
to
the
train
there
was
silence
for
a
time
which
finally
was
interrupted
by
a
tap
at
the
door
come
in
called
edna
the
door
opened
and
in
walked
ben
with
a
large
red
book
under
his
arm
hello
you
little
old
scalawag
he
said
what
in
the
world
did
you
go
and
do
this
for
i
could
help
it
said
edna
apologetically
you
poor
little
old
kitten
of
course
you
could
well
i
have
brought
you
up
fox
and
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
the
lady
by
the
willow
has
had
another
accident
she
dropped
her
last
chocolate
marshmallow
and
the
dog
stepped
on
it
of
course
that
was
as
bad
as
the
first
but
when
you
have
only
one
handkerchief
it
is
pretty
hard
to
have
to
cry
it
twice
full
of
tears
fortunately
hers
has
had
a
chance
to
dry
between
whiles
edna
smiled
it
was
good
to
have
ben
come
in
with
his
nonsense
she
found
her
eyelash
yet
no
and
it
was
a
wet
one
which
is
awfully
hard
to
find
unless
it
is
raining
it
is
hard
enough
then
goodness
knows
how
did
you
stand
all
the
racket
this
morning
if
a
noisy
noise
annoys
an
oyster
how
much
of
a
noisy
noise
does
it
take
to
annoy
pinky
blooms
that
sounds
like
a
problem
in
mental
arithmetic
but
it
is
shall
i
read
to
you
a
little
oh
please
about
reynard
the
fox
shall
it
be
oh
yes
i
do
so
want
to
know
how
he
lost
his
tail
then
here
goes
said
ben
as
he
opened
the
big
red
book
edna
settled
herself
back
against
the
pillows
and
ben
began
the
story
while
edna
was
so
interested
that
she
forgot
all
about
her
headache
he
finished
the
tale
before
he
put
the
book
down
how
do
you
like
it
he
asked
it
is
perfectly
fine
are
there
other
stories
in
that
book
yes
some
mighty
good
ones
here
do
you
want
to
see
the
pictures
they
are
funny
and
but
they
are
pretty
good
for
all
that
he
laid
the
book
across
edna
knees
and
showed
her
the
illustrations
relating
to
reynard
the
fox
all
of
which
interested
her
vastly
i
am
so
glad
i
know
about
this
book
she
said
as
she
came
to
the
last
page
i
always
thought
it
was
only
for
and
never
even
looked
at
it
will
you
read
me
some
more
sorry
i
ca
ducky
dear
for
i
am
off
by
the
morning
train
to
a
football
game
which
i
ca
miss
oh
i
forgot
about
that
are
the
boys
going
too
yes
and
celia
we
are
all
going
back
together
there
is
something
on
at
the
evanses
saturday
night
and
celia
would
miss
that
neither
would
you
said
edna
slyly
you
a
mean
horrid
little
girl
said
ben
in
a
high
little
voice
i
just
going
to
take
my
book
and
go
home
so
i
am
it
is
your
book
it
is
grandma
i
do
care
if
it
is
i
not
going
to
play
with
you
and
i
will
slap
your
doll
real
hard
do
you
mean
serena
she
is
my
doll
she
is
grandma
her
name
is
serena
do
you
remember
i
known
her
ever
since
i
was
a
little
little
thing
and
what
are
you
now
but
a
little
little
thing
i
should
like
to
know
i
bigger
than
lulie
willis
but
i
not
big
enough
to
go
to
party
saturday
night
she
spoke
somewhat
soberly
for
she
did
want
to
be
there
oh
never
mind
said
ben
with
an
air
of
comforting
her
i
shall
be
there
and
i
am
as
big
as
two
of
you
i
do
see
how
that
makes
it
any
better
said
edna
after
searching
her
mind
for
a
reason
why
it
should
be
of
any
comfort
to
her
oh
yes
it
does
returned
ben
for
if
i
were
only
as
big
as
you
i
should
be
there
either
as
if
that
helped
it
oh
yes
it
does
for
you
see
they
will
have
a
lot
of
good
things
and
i
can
eat
enough
for
you
and
me
both
i
am
sure
he
added
triumphantly
that
is
an
excellent
argument
if
a
thing
can
be
done
for
two
persons
instead
of
one
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
edna
put
her
head
back
against
the
pillows
ben
was
too
much
for
her
when
he
took
that
stand
there
said
the
lad
contritely
i
making
your
head
worse
by
my
foolishness
are
you
tired
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
would
you
like
one
of
the
kittens
oh
yes
ben
i
would
they
are
so
comforting
and
cozy
i
am
glad
you
thought
of
that
shall
i
leave
the
red
book
or
take
it
down
leave
it
please
i
might
like
to
look
at
it
after
a
while
so
ben
went
off
returning
directly
with
one
of
the
kittens
which
he
deposited
on
the
bed
and
which
presently
cuddled
close
to
the
child
then
ben
left
her
serena
by
her
side
and
the
kitten
purring
contentedly
in
her
arms
chapter
vi
the
old
house
although
edna
was
much
better
the
next
day
it
was
thought
prudent
to
keep
her
indoors
all
the
guests
departed
with
the
exception
of
her
mother
her
aunt
alice
and
her
own
self
the
house
resumed
its
ordinary
quiet
and
seemed
rather
an
empty
place
after
its
throng
of
thanksgiving
visitors
you
better
make
up
your
mind
to
stay
another
week
daughter
said
grandma
to
edna
mother
this
child
is
fit
to
be
out
and
wo
be
for
two
or
three
days
oh
i
think
she
will
be
able
to
go
by
monday
replied
conway
i
should
like
to
keep
her
out
of
school
so
long
her
health
is
of
much
more
importance
than
school
grandma
went
on
she
is
always
well
up
in
her
studies
is
she
you
remember
that
i
did
have
the
usual
visit
last
summer
and
as
alice
is
going
to
stay
we
could
all
have
a
nice
cozy
time
together
but
how
would
things
go
on
at
home
without
me
plenty
well
enough
i
am
sure
lizzie
can
take
care
of
henry
and
the
boys
i
am
not
so
sure
about
the
boys
though
i
suppose
henry
could
get
along
very
well
and
celia
is
in
town
all
through
the
week
why
could
charlie
and
frank
stay
with
the
porter
boys
till
we
get
back
piped
up
edna
from
her
stool
by
the
fire
you
know
mother
that
porter
has
asked
and
asked
them
for
her
boys
have
already
stayed
weeks
with
us
in
the
summer
i
know
returned
conway
a
little
doubtfully
i
am
sure
that
is
an
excellent
plan
said
grandma
beaming
at
edna
over
her
knitting
edna
will
be
all
the
better
for
a
week
here
and
indeed
for
a
longer
time
oh
we
could
stay
longer
than
next
saturday
at
the
very
outside
put
in
conway
hastily
i
love
to
stay
mother
dear
but
you
know
a
housekeeper
can
not
be
too
long
away
especially
when
she
has
not
arranged
beforehand
to
do
so
grandma
nodded
at
edna
we
consider
it
settled
that
you
are
to
stay
for
another
week
let
have
it
all
arranged
daughter
call
up
long
distance
and
let
henry
know
i
promised
him
anyhow
that
i
would
let
him
know
how
edna
was
getting
along
he
was
afraid
when
he
went
away
that
she
might
be
in
for
a
serious
illness
i
shall
be
glad
to
let
him
know
she
is
better
and
he
will
be
so
glad
to
hear
that
he
wo
mind
your
telling
him
you
will
stay
longer
remarked
grandma
with
a
little
laugh
conway
went
to
the
telephone
and
soon
it
was
settled
that
they
were
to
remain
i
do
know
what
uncle
justus
will
say
conway
observed
when
she
reëntered
the
room
he
will
think
i
am
a
very
injudicious
mother
to
keep
you
out
of
school
so
long
not
if
you
tell
him
i
was
sick
returned
edna
who
secretly
rather
enjoyed
the
prospect
of
making
such
an
announcement
like
most
children
she
liked
the
importance
which
an
illness
gave
to
her
small
self
saturday
was
an
indoors
day
spent
with
serena
virginia
and
the
big
red
book
sunday
too
edna
was
shut
in
except
for
the
few
minutes
she
was
allowed
to
walk
up
and
down
the
porch
in
the
sun
she
was
well
wrapped
up
for
this
event
and
was
charged
not
to
put
foot
on
the
damp
ground
it
had
been
rather
a
lonesome
morning
with
everyone
at
church
except
amanda
but
the
little
girl
stood
it
pretty
well
she
read
aloud
to
an
audience
consisting
of
the
two
dolls
and
the
three
kittens
she
sang
hymns
in
rather
a
husky
voice
to
be
sure
and
she
stood
at
the
window
a
long
time
watching
the
people
pass
by
on
their
way
to
and
from
church
in
the
afternoon
her
grandfather
took
his
two
daughters
to
see
some
relative
reliance
went
off
to
sunday
school
and
edna
was
left
alone
with
her
grandmother
who
told
her
stories
and
sang
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
melodeon
she
had
used
when
a
little
girl
edna
enjoyed
this
performance
very
much
but
after
a
while
grandma
was
tired
of
an
instrument
that
skipped
notes
and
wheezed
like
an
old
horse
so
they
went
back
to
the
big
chair
by
the
open
fire
grandma
continued
the
singing
rocking
edna
in
her
arms
till
the
child
fell
fast
asleep
the
drowsy
hum
of
the
hanging
on
the
crane
helping
to
make
a
lullaby
when
she
woke
up
it
was
nearly
dark
she
heard
her
voice
in
the
hall
and
realized
that
the
long
sabbath
day
was
nearly
over
this
was
the
last
day
for
the
weather
was
clear
and
bracing
and
well
wrapped
up
edna
was
able
to
enjoy
it
reliance
always
joined
her
when
the
work
was
done
in
the
afternoon
and
she
led
her
to
the
acquaintance
of
two
or
three
other
little
girls
alcinda
hewlett
the
daughter
of
the
postmaster
reba
manning
the
minister
daughter
and
esther
ann
taber
who
lived
just
across
the
way
these
three
were
playing
with
reliance
and
edna
in
front
of
esther
ann
one
day
when
suddenly
esther
spoke
up
i
know
where
there
is
an
empty
house
and
anyone
can
go
into
it
who
wants
to
where
is
it
asked
reba
with
interest
down
past
old
sam
titus
do
you
know
that
brown
house
back
there
by
the
orchard
oh
but
it
is
haunted
cried
alcinda
nonsense
it
could
be
put
in
reba
my
father
says
there
such
things
as
haunted
houses
and
he
ought
to
know
the
word
of
such
high
authority
as
the
minister
could
not
be
gainsaid
though
the
suggestion
gave
the
girls
rather
a
creepy
feeling
i
dare
you
all
to
go
in
there
with
me
spoke
up
esther
ann
oh
esther
ann
dast
we
said
alcinda
why
not
nobody
lives
there
and
i
do
believe
anyone
owns
it
for
there
is
never
a
person
goes
in
or
out
even
to
do
spring
cleaning
i
heard
my
mother
say
that
two
old
ladies
lived
there
sisters
and
they
did
speak
to
one
another
for
years
that
was
long
ago
and
since
they
died
nobody
knows
who
the
place
belongs
to
for
it
is
ever
lived
in
like
that
place
where
we
go
to
gather
chestnuts
spoke
up
reba
anybody
can
go
there
and
get
all
they
want
my
father
said
i
could
go
and
that
it
was
all
right
and
he
knows
of
course
he
does
agreed
esther
ann
come
who
is
going
with
me
i
as
soon
go
as
not
reliance
was
the
first
to
speak
how
do
you
get
in
asked
alcinda
a
little
doubtfully
walk
in
goosey
just
open
the
door
and
walk
in
is
the
door
locked
the
back
door
is
i
tried
it
one
day
replied
esther
ann
why
did
you
go
in
then
asked
alcinda
well
i
was
all
by
myself
and
and
i
thought
it
would
be
nicer
to
have
some
one
with
me
it
always
is
when
you
want
to
explore
this
seemed
a
perfectly
reasonable
answer
and
the
others
were
reassured
moreover
to
a
company
of
five
nothing
was
likely
to
happen
they
thought
and
the
spirit
of
adventure
was
high
in
the
breast
of
more
than
one
we
better
start
right
along
suggested
reliance
for
i
have
to
be
back
and
edna
must
stay
out
after
dark
then
come
along
all
that
want
to
go
cried
esther
ann
taking
the
lead
off
they
started
down
the
wide
street
bordered
by
maples
now
shorn
of
their
leaves
but
furnishing
a
carpet
of
yellow
underfoot
past
the
church
the
store
the
schoolhouse
and
on
to
the
old
brown
house
sitting
back
behind
an
orchard
of
gnarled
crooked
apple
trees
the
place
was
all
grown
up
with
weeds
though
here
and
there
were
signs
of
a
former
garden
up
the
rotting
pillars
of
the
porch
a
woodbine
still
clambered
and
around
the
door
lilac
bushes
kept
their
green
though
she
had
come
thus
far
without
mishap
alcinda
courage
suddenly
failed
her
and
she
turned
and
ran
cat
cat
called
esther
ann
after
her
this
had
the
effect
of
arresting
alcinda
in
her
flight
and
she
stood
still
come
on
cried
esther
ann
i
do
want
to
called
back
alcinda
i
wait
out
here
for
you
you
do
know
what
you
missing
esther
ann
called
back
trying
once
more
to
persuade
her
i
wait
for
you
here
repeated
alcinda
taking
up
her
position
on
the
horse
block
by
the
gate
all
right
responded
esther
ann
and
opened
the
door
which
gave
easily
as
she
turned
the
knob
the
four
little
girls
found
themselves
in
a
dingy
kitchen
whose
belongings
remained
as
they
had
been
left
years
before
cobwebs
hung
from
the
ceiling
dust
was
everywhere
the
stove
rusty
and
falling
to
pieces
still
held
one
or
two
pots
and
pans
there
was
crockery
on
the
dresser
and
a
lamp
on
the
table
esther
ann
led
the
way
to
the
next
room
i
do
think
this
one
is
a
bit
interesting
she
made
the
remark
as
she
penetrated
further
do
you
think
we
ought
to
go
whispered
edna
to
reliance
as
these
two
lagged
a
little
in
the
rear
why
not
anyone
can
come
in
if
it
belongs
to
no
one
and
they
say
it
does
belong
to
a
soul
nobody
lives
here
and
why
have
we
a
right
as
well
as
the
rest
of
the
world
this
argument
satisfied
edna
and
she
followed
along
through
the
deserted
rooms
catching
sight
of
a
cover
here
a
bunch
of
withered
flowers
there
books
long
untouched
lay
half
open
on
a
table
in
one
room
the
bed
was
still
unmade
in
another
and
everything
was
confusion
is
it
lovely
and
spooky
said
esther
ann
tingling
with
excitement
i
going
to
see
what
is
in
those
bureau
drawers
she
darted
toward
an
bureau
which
stood
in
the
room
flopped
down
on
her
knees
and
drew
out
the
lower
drawer
oh
girls
she
cried
look
here
the
others
gathered
around
her
to
see
boxes
in
which
were
the
treasures
of
a
forgotten
owner
strings
of
beads
white
kid
gloves
a
fan
with
ivory
sticks
combs
and
ornaments
of
various
kinds
let
each
take
something
home
to
her
mother
proposed
esther
ann
i
speak
for
the
fan
oh
esther
do
you
dare
asked
reba
why
not
they
do
belong
to
anyone
came
back
the
old
argument
some
one
else
will
most
likely
take
them
if
we
do
remarked
reliance
conclusively
this
satisfied
the
less
venturesome
and
they
all
sat
down
on
the
floor
to
make
a
selection
reba
chose
a
quaint
silver
buckle
reliance
selected
a
edna
decided
upon
a
comb
was
it
lovely
that
we
should
find
them
said
esther
ann
enthusiastically
it
will
be
so
nice
to
be
able
to
take
home
presents
i
am
glad
no
one
else
found
them
before
we
did
i
wonder
how
long
the
back
door
has
been
opened
said
reba
has
it
always
been
i
do
know
i
never
tried
it
till
the
other
day
esther
ann
told
her
after
rummaging
a
little
further
and
discovering
frocks
and
coats
of
unfamiliar
cut
hanging
in
the
closets
and
wardrobes
and
coming
upon
mouldy
slippers
and
hats
in
other
places
they
concluded
they
must
go
alcinda
had
wearied
of
waiting
and
had
gone
off
long
before
therefore
the
four
after
shutting
the
door
behind
them
took
their
way
through
the
path
to
the
gate
then
up
the
street
to
their
respective
homes
do
you
think
willis
will
be
pleased
with
the
asked
reliance
as
they
were
entering
the
gate
at
overlea
i
sure
she
will
she
can
use
it
when
she
goes
to
the
city
to
see
uncle
bert
and
i
know
mother
will
like
this
comb
returned
edna
reliance
had
no
time
to
present
her
gift
at
that
moment
for
amanda
called
her
to
come
at
once
to
attend
to
her
duties
remarking
that
she
was
late
but
edna
hunted
up
her
mother
who
was
upstairs
oh
mother
mother
she
cried
entering
the
room
where
her
mother
was
see
what
i
have
for
you
is
it
pretty
her
mother
looked
up
from
the
letter
she
was
writing
what
is
it
dear
why
edna
what
a
beautiful
comb
where
did
you
get
it
i
found
it
replied
edna
in
an
assured
tone
we
all
found
lovely
things
then
she
launched
forth
upon
an
account
of
the
adventures
her
mother
listened
attentively
and
when
the
child
had
finished
her
tale
she
drew
her
close
to
her
side
kissing
the
little
eager
face
and
saying
dear
child
i
am
afraid
you
have
made
a
mistake
the
things
were
not
for
you
little
girls
to
take
but
mother
they
did
belong
to
anyone
they
have
been
there
for
years
and
years
and
nobody
wants
them
they
would
have
to
belong
to
some
one
dear
child
we
will
ask
grandma
about
the
house
and
whose
property
it
is
let
us
go
find
her
they
hunted
up
willis
who
listened
interestedly
to
what
they
had
to
tell
the
old
topham
house
she
said
when
they
had
finished
it
belonged
to
two
sisters
miss
nancy
and
miss
tabitha
topham
these
two
lived
together
for
years
but
finally
they
quarreled
and
each
vowed
that
she
would
never
speak
to
the
other
they
died
within
a
few
weeks
of
one
another
and
there
were
no
nearer
heirs
than
distant
cousins
who
have
never
troubled
themselves
to
look
after
the
place
old
nathan
holcomb
was
the
nearest
neighbor
and
he
used
to
keep
things
pretty
well
secured
but
since
his
death
the
place
has
been
going
to
rack
and
ruin
more
and
more
each
year
there
is
some
fine
old
furniture
there
and
it
is
a
wonder
everything
in
the
house
has
not
been
stolen
before
now
but
as
the
place
has
the
reputation
of
being
haunted
it
has
been
more
or
less
avoided
i
never
heard
of
its
being
open
to
the
public
and
i
shall
speak
to
some
one
who
will
see
that
it
is
made
secure
even
if
it
is
not
valued
by
the
present
owners
it
should
not
be
left
for
tramps
or
any
chance
vagrant
to
make
use
of
edna
looked
down
at
the
comb
which
she
still
held
in
her
hand
what
must
i
do
about
this
she
asked
you
must
take
it
back
and
restore
it
to
its
place
her
mother
told
her
i
am
perfectly
sure
that
not
one
of
you
little
girls
dreamed
that
she
had
no
right
to
take
the
things
but
nevertheless
they
were
not
yours
and
i
am
very
certain
that
the
other
mothers
will
say
the
same
thing
reliance
has
a
lovely
said
edna
regretfully
she
was
going
to
give
it
to
you
grandma
willis
smiled
i
appreciate
the
spirit
but
she
must
not
be
allowed
to
keep
it
my
dear
edna
face
sobered
she
felt
much
crestfallen
she
wondered
what
father
would
say
she
did
not
have
long
to
wait
to
find
this
out
for
after
supper
came
two
young
callers
who
sidled
in
with
rather
shamefaced
expressions
suppose
you
take
reba
and
esther
ann
into
the
for
a
little
while
suggested
grandma
encouragingly
little
folks
like
to
chatter
about
their
own
affairs
i
well
know
edna
shot
her
grandma
a
grateful
look
and
soon
was
closeted
with
the
little
girls
oh
edna
what
did
your
mother
say
began
esther
ann
she
said
i
must
take
back
the
comb
because
i
had
no
right
to
take
it
that
just
what
my
mother
said
returned
esther
ann
my
father
said
it
dishonest
put
in
reba
i
mean
dishonest
to
keep
it
he
knew
we
did
mean
to
steal
oh
reba
do
say
such
a
dreadful
word
said
edna
in
distress
it
would
be
stealing
you
know
if
we
were
to
keep
the
things
continued
reba
bluntly
my
father
says
you
could
call
it
by
any
other
name
and
that
to
break
into
a
house
is
burglary
this
sounded
even
more
dreadful
though
esther
ann
relieved
the
speech
of
its
effect
by
saying
but
we
did
break
in
we
just
opened
the
door
and
walked
in
there
would
have
been
anyone
to
answer
if
we
had
knocked
that
makes
me
feel
kind
of
shivery
remarked
edna
i
would
rather
not
go
back
but
i
suppose
we
shall
have
to
yes
we
shall
have
to
reba
made
the
statement
determinedly
therefore
it
was
with
anything
but
an
adventurous
spirit
that
the
four
little
girls
went
on
their
errand
the
next
afternoon
there
was
no
poking
into
nooks
and
corners
this
time
but
straight
to
the
bureau
went
they
solemnly
was
each
article
returned
to
the
box
from
which
it
was
taken
silently
they
down
the
dusty
stairs
and
through
the
silent
rooms
to
the
outer
air
where
each
drew
a
sigh
of
relief
esther
ann
was
the
first
to
speak
there
that
done
she
said
i
ever
want
to
go
there
again
nor
i
nor
i
nor
i
chanted
the
other
three
chapter
vii
the
mill
stream
on
their
way
home
from
the
old
house
the
four
girls
saw
alcinda
approaching
do
let
say
anything
to
her
about
where
we
been
said
esther
ann
no
do
let
returned
reba
you
know
she
did
want
to
go
there
in
the
first
place
it
was
only
because
she
was
scared
to
rejoined
esther
ann
well
anyhow
do
let
say
anything
about
it
continued
reba
do
you
say
so
girls
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
at
edna
and
reliance
who
were
walking
behind
i
do
see
any
reason
why
we
should
said
reliance
of
course
if
she
should
ask
questions
we
would
tell
her
a
story
oh
no
we
would
do
that
agreed
the
other
girls
but
alcinda
had
no
thought
of
old
houses
or
anything
else
at
this
time
but
her
little
dog
jetty
a
handsome
black
pommeranian
to
whom
she
was
devoted
and
of
whom
she
was
very
proud
oh
girls
she
exclaimed
as
she
came
up
have
you
seen
or
heard
anything
of
jetty
we
have
seen
him
since
morning
and
i
am
so
afraid
he
has
been
stolen
oh
would
that
be
dreadful
said
edna
sympathetically
i
do
see
who
would
steal
him
said
esther
ann
practically
everyone
knows
he
belongs
to
you
and
there
are
many
strangers
that
come
through
the
village
there
are
a
few
there
was
a
tramp
at
our
back
door
only
a
few
days
ago
but
you
did
lose
jet
a
few
days
ago
it
was
only
that
you
missed
him
i
think
it
more
likely
he
is
shut
up
somewhere
decided
reba
where
have
you
looked
alcinda
oh
pretty
near
everywhere
i
could
think
of
and
i
have
asked
everybody
who
might
have
seen
him
maybe
he
has
gone
off
with
some
other
dogs
suggested
reliance
dogs
will
do
that
and
sometimes
they
do
come
back
for
two
or
three
days
prendergast
had
a
dog
that
did
that
way
he
lives
near
where
we
used
to
you
know
and
he
had
a
collie
named
rob
roy
that
would
go
off
now
and
then
and
the
other
dogs
would
bring
him
back
after
a
while
he
would
come
in
looking
so
ashamed
while
they
stood
off
to
see
how
he
would
be
treated
jetty
never
did
run
away
before
said
alcinda
doubtfully
although
reliance
words
were
comforting
when
did
you
see
him
last
and
what
was
he
doing
asked
esther
ann
mother
heard
him
barking
at
a
wagon
that
was
going
by
he
does
bark
at
everyone
but
there
are
some
people
he
ca
bear
what
people
inquired
esther
ann
trying
to
get
a
clue
he
does
like
the
butcher
boy
nor
the
man
that
drives
the
mill
wagon
nor
the
man
that
brings
the
laundry
he
always
runs
out
and
barks
at
them
have
you
asked
any
of
them
about
him
no
not
yet
then
i
tell
you
what
let
do
girls
proposed
esther
ann
two
of
us
can
go
around
by
the
mill
two
of
us
can
go
to
the
butcher
and
alcinda
can
go
to
the
laundry
place
all
right
exclaimed
alcinda
hopefully
it
would
be
lovely
if
you
all
would
do
that
i
speak
to
go
to
the
butcher
spoke
up
esther
ann
she
was
always
ready
to
arrange
affairs
for
everyone
reliance
you
and
edna
can
go
to
the
mill
it
is
such
a
very
great
way
and
reba
can
go
with
me
the
girls
all
accepted
this
arrangement
and
set
off
in
the
three
different
directions
do
you
like
going
to
the
mill
asked
edna
when
she
and
reliance
were
fairly
on
their
way
oh
yes
much
better
than
going
to
the
butcher
although
it
is
quite
a
little
further
it
is
a
much
prettier
walk
i
always
did
like
mill
ponds
did
you
edna
why
i
do
know
much
about
them
but
i
should
think
i
would
like
them
do
we
turn
off
here
yes
this
road
leads
straight
to
the
mill
you
can
see
it
presently
through
the
trees
it
is
so
very
far
is
it
no
but
it
is
a
little
further
to
the
mill
pond
i
wonder
if
the
miller
is
there
is
he
always
there
he
is
always
there
in
the
morning
but
not
always
in
the
afternoon
no
the
mill
is
shut
down
how
do
you
know
i
do
hear
it
and
see
there
the
wheel
is
moving
oh
edna
thought
that
reliance
was
very
clever
to
know
all
this
before
they
had
even
reached
the
mill
which
now
loomed
up
before
them
a
grey
stone
structure
in
a
little
nest
of
trees
which
climbed
the
hill
behind
it
and
spread
along
the
sides
of
the
stream
flowing
on
to
join
the
river
it
is
very
pretty
here
is
it
said
edna
admiringly
what
do
they
call
the
stream
reliance
black
creek
the
mill
pond
and
dam
and
sluice
and
all
those
are
higher
up
do
you
want
to
go
see
them
why
yes
if
we
ca
do
anything
about
finding
jetty
i
thought
we
might
go
around
by
the
miller
house
on
our
way
back
it
is
much
further
and
we
could
ask
there
this
seemed
a
wise
thing
to
do
edna
thought
and
she
cheerfully
followed
reliance
to
where
the
mill
pond
lay
calm
and
smooth
before
them
it
must
be
lovely
here
in
summer
remarked
edna
enthusiastically
it
is
one
of
the
prettiest
places
anywhere
about
we
come
here
sometimes
for
our
picnics
all
of
us
school
children
and
the
teacher
would
you
dare
go
across
edna
edna
looked
around
but
saw
no
bridge
how
could
we
get
across
she
asked
i
do
see
any
way
but
to
swim
reliance
laughed
there
she
said
pointing
to
the
heavy
beam
which
stretched
from
shore
to
shore
and
below
which
the
water
was
slowly
trickling
that
the
bridge
we
children
always
use
edna
drew
back
in
dismay
oh
how
can
you
i
would
dare
it
is
so
near
the
water
and
suppose
you
should
fall
in
i
would
be
sure
to
get
dizzy
and
over
i
would
go
oh
pooh
i
do
get
dizzy
returned
reliance
i
will
show
you
how
easy
it
is
and
in
another
minute
she
was
standing
on
the
beam
edna
shivering
and
with
a
queer
sensation
under
her
knees
oh
do
come
back
reliance
she
cried
i
am
so
afraid
you
will
fall
in
but
reliance
did
not
hear
her
or
if
she
did
hear
she
paid
no
heed
but
stood
looking
earnestly
at
a
point
beyond
her
in
the
water
edna
edna
she
presently
called
you
will
have
to
come
i
really
believe
it
is
jetty
out
there
in
the
water
edna
wrung
her
hands
oh
i
ca
i
ca
she
wept
you
must
help
me
try
to
get
him
in
i
come
back
for
you
edna
shrank
away
from
the
shore
divided
between
her
fear
of
crossing
and
her
desire
to
help
in
the
rescue
reliance
lost
no
time
in
reaching
her
you
will
have
to
come
she
cried
excitedly
he
is
nearer
the
other
side
i
must
go
over
and
try
to
find
a
board
or
two
and
you
must
stay
on
the
beam
and
watch
so
as
to
see
which
way
he
heads
poor
little
fellow
i
wonder
how
long
he
has
been
in
there
come
edna
you
can
put
your
arms
around
my
waist
and
i
will
go
ahead
you
must
look
at
the
water
but
just
step
along
after
me
i
wo
let
you
fall
terrible
as
this
effort
promised
to
be
edna
decided
that
she
must
make
it
if
they
would
save
jetty
and
she
followed
reliance
who
encouraging
coaxing
and
leading
the
way
step
by
step
managed
to
get
the
child
safely
across
is
there
any
other
way
of
getting
back
quavered
edna
when
they
were
over
i
think
there
is
a
little
bridge
further
down
but
never
mind
that
now
edna
you
stay
there
and
watch
while
i
get
a
board
and
put
it
out
toward
him
i
should
wonder
if
i
could
find
one
somewhere
about
fearfully
edna
crouched
on
the
beam
which
seemed
but
a
few
inches
from
the
water
she
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
water
that
she
might
not
lose
sight
of
the
little
black
head
now
not
so
very
far
away
jetty
jetty
she
called
we
get
you
out
nice
doggie
please
do
drown
before
reliance
comes
the
little
dog
renewed
his
struggles
and
began
to
swim
toward
her
edna
continuing
her
encouraging
talk
presently
reliance
came
down
the
bank
up
which
she
had
scrambled
she
was
dragging
a
board
behind
her
and
finding
some
difficulty
in
doing
so
is
he
still
there
she
panted
yes
and
trying
to
swim
over
to
me
do
let
him
do
let
him
come
over
on
the
bank
it
will
be
easier
to
get
him
from
there
there
another
board
up
there
i
will
go
get
it
if
you
will
hold
on
to
this
one
edna
hesitated
to
cross
the
few
feet
between
her
and
the
shore
quick
quick
insisted
reliance
he
might
drift
to
the
dam
and
get
caught
there
we
must
get
him
before
he
reaches
it
get
down
on
your
hands
and
knees
and
crawl
edna
obeyed
and
in
another
moment
was
running
along
the
bank
toward
reliance
forgetting
everything
but
her
eagerness
to
save
the
little
dog
who
seeing
both
girls
turned
and
feebly
swam
to
where
they
were
standing
his
strength
was
almost
spent
and
he
had
hard
work
to
keep
from
being
borne
along
by
the
current
which
was
swifter
in
the
center
of
the
pond
i
have
to
shove
out
the
board
so
he
can
reach
it
said
reliance
excitedly
here
take
this
pole
and
try
to
keep
the
board
from
drifting
toward
the
dam
while
i
go
get
the
other
board
and
she
thrust
the
forked
pole
into
edna
hands
and
then
sprang
up
the
bank
while
edna
crouched
down
as
near
the
water
as
possible
in
order
to
make
best
use
of
her
pole
it
was
not
easy
to
keep
the
board
from
drifting
out
but
along
the
shallows
it
was
quiet
water
and
it
did
not
go
so
very
far
and
before
long
the
little
dog
was
able
to
reach
it
crawling
upon
it
and
shivering
while
he
wagged
his
tail
feebly
as
edna
continued
to
cheer
him
it
was
harder
work
now
that
the
board
was
heavier
by
reason
of
the
added
weight
and
once
or
twice
edna
was
afraid
that
after
all
her
efforts
would
be
in
vain
it
would
be
dreadful
to
abandon
jetty
when
he
was
so
near
to
land
and
she
wished
he
would
attempt
to
swim
to
her
but
the
little
creature
was
too
exhausted
to
make
further
effort
now
that
he
had
reached
footing
though
he
whined
a
little
when
the
board
drifted
out
just
as
she
was
afraid
it
would
go
beyond
her
reach
reliance
came
scrambling
back
breathless
from
her
exercise
i
had
such
a
time
she
panted
oh
edna
he
is
really
safe
and
it
is
really
poor
little
jetty
how
glad
alcinda
will
be
here
do
let
the
board
go
she
snatched
the
pole
from
edna
hands
i
hold
on
to
it
while
you
push
out
the
other
board
i
can
wade
in
and
get
him
if
i
ca
do
anything
else
but
once
so
near
shore
as
the
second
board
brought
him
jetty
was
not
afraid
to
swim
the
remaining
distance
having
gathered
up
a
little
added
strength
and
after
coaxing
ordering
and
cajoling
the
girls
were
rewarded
by
seeing
the
little
creature
creep
to
the
edge
of
the
board
take
to
the
water
again
and
paddle
ashore
crouching
at
their
feet
in
an
ecstasy
of
joy
he
is
so
sopping
wet
i
am
afraid
he
will
take
cold
said
reliance
i
am
going
to
wrap
him
up
in
my
sweater
and
carry
him
but
wo
you
take
cold
said
edna
anxiously
no
for
i
am
too
warm
with
struggling
up
that
bank
and
down
again
we
can
walk
fast
at
first
jetty
did
not
even
have
power
to
shake
himself
but
before
many
minutes
his
dripping
coat
was
freed
of
many
drops
of
water
which
freely
sprinkled
the
girls
who
laughing
ran
at
a
safe
distance
and
then
reliance
wrapped
him
up
in
her
jersey
and
carried
him
away
from
the
scene
of
his
late
disaster
how
do
you
suppose
he
got
in
the
water
asked
edna
as
they
trudged
along
i
think
someone
threw
him
in
oh
reliance
do
you
really
yes
i
do
we
go
right
by
the
miller
house
and
i
am
going
to
stop
there
and
ask
them
what
they
know
about
it
all
do
you
think
the
miller
did
it
oh
no
he
would
do
such
a
wicked
thing
he
is
a
very
nice
man
but
he
might
have
seen
jetty
about
the
place
and
we
may
be
able
to
find
out
something
to
edna
satisfaction
a
small
footbridge
was
discovered
a
short
distance
below
and
on
this
they
crossed
reaching
the
miller
house
just
after
the
miller
himself
was
just
going
in
the
gate
reliance
marched
up
to
him
and
without
wasting
words
said
do
you
know
how
this
little
dog
happened
to
get
into
the
mill
pond
the
miller
paused
and
looked
down
at
the
black
nose
peeping
from
its
scarlet
wrapping
that
little
dog
i
saw
him
around
the
mill
this
morning
a
man
that
has
been
driving
for
me
said
he
found
it
along
the
road
is
it
your
dog
no
it
belongs
to
alcinda
hewlett
bob
hewlett
daughter
yes
her
father
keeps
the
store
and
is
the
postmaster
humph
the
miller
stroked
his
chin
and
looked
speculatively
at
the
little
dog
how
do
you
suppose
he
got
so
far
from
home
ventured
edna
should
wonder
if
he
was
brought
in
my
wagon
in
an
empty
sack
bad
man
bad
man
that
jeb
wilkins
jetty
always
barked
at
him
said
edna
i
guess
that
accounts
for
it
jeb
got
mad
and
thought
he
pay
the
little
creature
back
barked
at
him
did
he
well
i
do
blame
the
dog
i
did
some
pretty
tall
growling
myself
before
i
discharged
the
man
he
gone
now
for
good
or
bad
whichever
you
like
do
you
think
he
threw
the
dog
in
the
water
asked
reliance
coming
directly
to
the
point
that
just
what
i
do
think
i
should
wonder
if
he
meant
to
steal
him
at
first
and
sell
him
for
it
is
a
valuable
dog
they
tell
me
but
the
dog
got
out
and
i
was
keeping
an
eye
on
jeb
so
he
could
make
way
with
the
beast
i
meant
to
take
him
home
and
advertise
for
his
owner
but
when
i
came
to
look
for
him
the
dog
was
gone
though
jeb
was
there
said
as
innocent
as
you
please
when
i
made
inquiries
that
some
people
drove
by
and
took
the
dog
back
to
town
where
he
belonged
oh
exclaimed
edna
her
eyes
and
mouth
round
with
surprise
and
disapproval
just
what
he
said
made
it
up
out
of
whole
cloth
of
course
and
meantime
had
taken
his
spite
out
on
me
and
the
poor
little
dog
by
throwing
him
overboard
how
did
you
happen
upon
him
reliance
gave
an
account
of
the
rescue
and
received
approving
nods
smart
girls
you
two
he
commented
oh
i
was
smart
at
all
piped
up
edna
it
was
all
reliance
i
could
have
done
a
thing
without
her
well
said
millikin
with
a
smile
you
did
your
part
and
enough
said
i
was
just
going
to
unhitch
but
there
is
my
buggy
all
ready
and
i
guess
the
quickest
way
to
get
you
back
to
the
village
is
to
take
you
there
behind
dolly
oh
but
we
can
walk
thank
you
protested
reliance
it
pretty
much
of
a
walk
and
the
sooner
you
get
there
the
more
pleased
several
people
will
be
i
for
one
because
i
do
want
bob
hewlett
little
girl
to
mourn
for
her
pet
any
longer
than
she
need
and
again
because
i
am
in
a
way
responsible
for
what
has
happened
i
go
get
the
buggy
right
off
you
wait
here
it
wo
take
a
minute
so
presently
they
were
driving
along
toward
home
reliance
with
a
horse
blanket
around
her
which
millikin
fished
out
from
under
the
seat
and
insisted
upon
her
putting
around
her
shoulders
to
say
that
alcinda
was
overjoyed
at
the
sight
of
her
little
pet
which
she
had
given
up
for
lost
would
be
speaking
mildly
i
never
forget
you
two
girls
never
she
cried
i
shall
thank
you
forever
and
ever
and
you
too
mr
millikin
me
i
partly
to
blame
for
i
ought
to
have
discharged
that
scoundrel
long
ago
but
he
was
a
good
driver
and
i
was
waiting
to
fill
his
place
well
it
all
come
out
right
after
all
i
hope
your
little
dog
will
be
none
the
worse
for
the
experience
i
pay
his
doctor
bills
if
he
gets
sick
after
which
speech
the
miller
drove
off
and
the
rescuers
darted
across
the
street
to
their
home
where
the
tardiness
of
their
appearance
was
entirely
forgiven
after
they
had
told
their
story
chapter
viii
jetty
party
grandma
was
so
concerned
lest
edna
had
taken
fresh
cold
by
reason
of
this
latest
adventure
that
she
insisted
upon
putting
the
little
girl
through
a
course
of
treatment
to
prevent
possible
evil
results
after
dabbling
in
that
cold
water
and
getting
her
feet
wet
it
will
be
a
wonder
if
she
is
laid
up
said
grandma
coming
into
the
room
just
as
edna
was
going
to
bed
she
must
have
her
feet
in
mustard
water
and
amanda
is
making
a
hot
lemonade
for
her
so
edna
feet
were
thrust
into
the
hot
bath
and
she
was
made
to
sip
the
hot
drink
then
was
bundled
into
bed
with
charges
not
to
allow
her
arms
out
from
under
the
covers
it
was
rather
a
warm
and
unpleasant
experience
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
grandma
said
the
next
morning
that
she
must
think
of
going
that
day
oh
dear
sighed
the
little
girl
when
she
was
alone
with
her
mother
do
you
think
grandma
is
very
particular
did
she
used
to
do
so
when
you
were
a
little
girl
she
did
indeed
and
when
she
was
a
little
girl
it
was
even
worse
for
instead
of
lemonade
to
drink
she
was
made
to
take
a
very
bitter
dose
of
herb
tea
or
a
dreadful
mess
called
composition
which
had
every
sort
of
nauseous
thing
in
it
you
can
think
of
little
folks
nowadays
get
off
very
easily
it
seems
to
me
i
did
mind
the
hot
lemonade
a
bit
but
i
shall
never
forget
the
smell
of
that
mustard
water
said
edna
after
a
pause
her
mother
laughed
you
must
be
thankful
that
it
is
no
more
than
that
what
am
i
going
to
do
inquired
the
little
girl
i
was
going
to
do
ever
so
many
nice
things
and
now
i
ca
then
we
must
think
up
some
nice
things
to
do
indoors
what
kind
of
things
i
shall
have
to
put
on
my
thinking
cap
in
order
to
find
that
out
meanwhile
suppose
you
run
down
to
grandma
with
this
tumbler
it
had
your
lemonade
in
it
and
should
go
down
to
be
washed
edna
ran
off
to
her
grandma
coming
back
presently
with
a
much
brighter
countenance
than
she
took
away
grandma
is
going
to
let
me
help
with
the
turtle
cakes
she
said
eagerly
that
a
very
nice
thing
you
think
i
think
that
is
very
nice
indeed
amanda
is
mixing
them
now
and
when
they
are
cut
out
i
am
going
to
help
with
the
turtles
mother
i
will
bring
you
one
of
my
turtles
as
soon
as
they
are
baked
these
turtle
cakes
were
much
prized
by
the
conway
children
when
grandma
sent
a
box
from
the
farm
there
was
always
a
supply
of
these
famous
cookies
grandma
had
promised
that
edna
should
take
some
home
with
her
when
she
went
on
saturday
morning
she
watched
amanda
roll
them
out
cut
them
in
rounds
and
place
them
in
the
pans
then
came
edna
part
in
the
preparation
amanda
showed
her
how
to
put
first
a
big
fat
raisin
in
the
center
of
the
cake
then
a
current
for
the
turtle
head
four
cloves
were
then
stuck
in
part
way
under
the
raisin
thus
making
the
feet
and
for
the
tail
another
clove
with
the
sharp
end
out
amanda
could
do
them
much
faster
than
edna
but
the
child
was
greatly
pleased
to
have
completed
a
whole
pan
all
by
herself
and
when
these
were
baked
she
carefully
carried
some
of
them
to
her
mother
and
aunt
alice
grandma
had
already
seen
the
results
of
her
granddaughter
labors
i
know
just
how
to
do
them
now
mother
said
edna
and
i
think
it
is
great
fun
grandma
is
going
to
save
the
pan
i
did
so
i
can
have
them
to
carry
home
you
might
have
a
for
the
dolls
this
afternoon
and
use
some
of
your
cookies
for
refreshments
could
reliance
come
why
i
should
think
so
i
have
thought
of
something
else
for
you
to
do
this
morning
you
could
begin
a
christmas
gift
for
celia
you
know
you
always
have
a
hard
time
keeping
her
gift
a
secret
what
kind
of
thing
could
i
make
i
noticed
that
your
sister
little
work
bag
was
getting
rather
dingy
and
i
am
sure
she
would
be
delighted
to
have
a
new
one
but
where
will
i
get
anything
to
make
it
of
no
doubt
grandma
has
something
in
her
she
always
has
all
sorts
of
odds
and
ends
and
it
would
give
her
pleasure
to
let
you
have
anything
that
might
serve
the
purpose
i
will
ask
her
and
we
can
get
the
ribbons
for
it
any
time
between
now
and
christmas
her
mother
was
as
good
as
her
word
and
leaving
the
room
came
back
in
a
few
minutes
with
a
large
bag
whose
contents
she
emptied
on
the
bed
there
she
said
take
your
choice
grandma
says
you
are
perfectly
welcome
to
anything
you
find
edna
began
turning
over
the
pieces
you
help
me
choose
mother
she
said
presently
i
do
know
just
how
big
the
piece
ought
to
be
her
mother
drew
up
her
chair
and
began
to
look
over
the
bits
of
gay
silk
before
her
i
declare
she
said
presently
here
is
a
piece
of
a
party
frock
i
wore
when
i
was
about
celia
age
it
was
almost
my
first
real
new
party
frock
for
before
that
i
always
wore
a
simple
white
muslin
this
is
perfectly
new
and
must
have
been
left
over
to
think
of
its
being
in
this
bag
all
those
years
it
appears
to
be
sufficiently
strong
however
she
shook
it
out
and
held
it
up
to
the
light
the
material
was
a
pale
green
silk
with
tiny
bunches
of
flowers
upon
it
edna
thought
it
very
pretty
i
think
celia
will
be
perfectly
delighted
to
have
a
bag
made
of
your
first
party
frock
mother
she
said
do
you
think
grandma
would
mind
my
having
it
i
am
sure
she
will
be
very
much
pleased
we
will
decide
upon
that
and
you
can
put
back
the
rest
of
the
pieces
there
will
be
an
abundance
in
this
for
a
nice
full
bag
i
am
sure
i
will
cut
it
out
for
you
and
show
you
just
how
to
make
it
the
time
passed
so
rapidly
in
planning
and
making
the
bag
that
it
was
the
dinner
hour
before
they
knew
it
and
after
dinner
came
an
unexpected
call
from
alcinda
she
was
a
little
girl
with
big
blue
eyes
and
straight
hair
but
upon
this
occasion
she
was
dimpling
and
smiling
as
she
handed
a
tiny
note
to
edna
upon
opening
this
edna
discovered
written
in
a
childish
hand
the
following
words
jetty
hewlett
requests
the
honor
of
miss
edna
conway
company
to
a
at
four
this
afternoon
oh

edna
i
awfully
afraid

ca
go
for
grandma
said
it
was
as
much
as
my
life
was
worth
to
go
out
of
the
house
oh
but
you
are
ill
are
you
asked
alcinda
no
but
she
is
afraid
i
will
be
but
you
must
come
persisted
alcinda
for
it
is
in
honor
of
you
and
reliance
and
jetty
is
going
to
help
receive
i
will
go
ask
mother
returned
edna
and
running
off
she
returned
with
conway
may
edna
come
to
jetty
begged
alcinda
we
have
everything
planned
and
it
will
be
perfectly
dreadful
if
she
stays
away
she
wo
take
cold
just
going
across
the
street
and
our
house
is
as
warm
as
anything
edna
looked
beseechingly
at
her
mother
do
please
say
yes
mother
she
begged
i
do
see
how
you
could
take
cold
going
just
across
the
street
if
you
wrap
up
well
and
wear
your
rubbers
said
her
mother
goody
goody
cried
alcinda
here
is
an
invitation
for
reliance
too
be
sure
to
come
at
four
i
have
some
more
invitations
to
deliver
so
i
must
go
now
i
need
have
a
for
the
dolls
said
edna
when
alcinda
had
gone
her
mother
smiled
you
speak
as
if
that
would
be
a
great
hardship
she
remarked
no
i
do
mean
that
but
i
would
so
much
rather
go
to
alcinda
shall
i
wear
my
best
frock
mother
why
yes
i
think
you
may
i
wonder
if
grandma
will
let
reliance
go
and
what
she
will
wear
said
edna
after
a
moment
thought
i
think
i
will
go
ask
mother
for
i
do
want
to
be
better
dressed
than
reliance
it
was
really
she
who
saved
jetty
you
know
that
is
the
proper
feeling
dear
child
edna
flew
off
to
find
reliance
who
had
received
her
invitation
and
hoped
for
the
permission
from
willis
i
do
hope
she
will
let
me
go
she
said
fervently
come
with
me
edna
when
i
ask
her
you
edna
was
very
ready
to
do
this
and
hunted
up
her
grandmother
oh
grandma
she
cried
we
been
invited
to
a
party
over
at
alcinda
jetty
is
giving
it
in
honor
of
reliance
and
me
mother
says
i
wo
take
cold
just
going
across
the
street
and
you
are
going
to
let
reliance
go
too
are
you
what
all
this
inquired
grandma
edna
repeated
her
news
but
her
grandmother
did
not
reply
for
a
moment
i
am
afraid
reliance
will
not
be
back
in
time
to
do
her
evening
work
she
said
at
last
oh
but
this
was
an
unexpected
objection
could
she
do
some
of
it
before
she
goes
she
might
do
some
but
not
all
however
we
will
see
reliance
you
bustle
around
and
see
how
smart
you
can
be
and
i
will
think
what
can
be
done
i
can
set
the
table
said
edna
eagerly
would
you
mind
if
it
were
done
so
much
ahead
of
time
for
just
this
once
no
replied
her
grandmother
very
kindly
and
may
i
skim
the
milk
and
bring
up
the
butter
for
supper
i
can
set
it
in
the
pantry
where
it
will
keep
cool
reliance
said
you
may
do
that
willis
told
her
what
else
will
there
be
to
do
asked
edna
as
the
two
little
girls
hurried
from
the
room
i
have
to
turn
down
the
beds
and
light
the
lamps
when
it
gets
dark
that
is
very
much
to
do
maybe
amanda
would
mind
seeing
to
those
things
for
just
this
one
time
i
am
going
to
ask
her
reliance
was
only
too
glad
to
have
edna
take
this
request
off
her
hands
herself
having
a
wholesome
awe
of
amanda
but
to
her
relief
amanda
was
in
a
good
humor
and
promised
to
look
after
these
extra
duties
so
in
good
season
reliance
was
free
to
prepare
for
the
party
while
edna
went
to
her
mother
to
be
dressed
mother
she
said
do
you
think
it
is
funny
to
go
to
a
party
with
a
bound
girl
is
a
bound
girl
the
same
as
a
friendless
you
know
margaret
mcdonald
is
our
friend
and
she
used
to
be
a
friendless
i
do
think
it
is
funny
at
all
reliance
had
no
home
to
be
sure
till
your
grandmother
took
her
but
she
is
a
good
little
girl
and
i
used
to
know
her
father
when
i
lived
here
oh
mother
did
you
oh
yes
he
was
quite
a
nice
young
man
i
never
knew
his
wife
but
i
am
afraid
he
did
not
marry
very
well
reliance
will
probably
have
to
work
for
her
living
but
that
is
no
reason
why
she
should
not
be
treated
as
an
equal
the
people
about
here
know
she
comes
of
good
stock
and
that
the
poverty
of
the
family
was
due
more
to
misfortune
than
misbehavior
i
have
no
doubt
but
reliance
will
make
a
fine
woman
as
her
grandmother
was
and
when
she
is
grown
up
she
may
marry
some
farmer
of
the
neighborhood
and
take
the
place
she
should
this
was
all
very
interesting
to
edna
and
she
sat
looking
at
the
outstretched
feet
upon
which
she
had
just
drawn
her
stockings
till
her
mother
reminded
her
that
time
was
flying
wake
up
dearie
she
said
why
what
a
brown
study
you
are
in
reliance
will
be
ready
long
before
you
are
hurry
on
with
your
shoes
and
then
come
let
me
tie
your
hair
at
this
edna
jumped
and
bustled
around
with
such
promptness
that
she
was
ready
by
the
time
reliance
came
to
the
door
neatly
dressed
in
her
bright
plaid
frock
and
scarlet
hair
ribbons
she
was
a
little
girl
with
rosy
cheeks
and
though
not
exactly
pretty
had
a
pleasant
intelligent
face
edna
had
finally
decided
not
to
wear
her
best
white
frock
but
had
on
a
pretty
blue
challis
quite
suited
to
the
occasion
her
mother
told
her
the
two
little
girls
set
out
in
high
feather
and
arrived
at
house
to
find
that
several
had
reached
there
before
them
jetty
with
a
huge
red
bow
on
his
collar
barked
a
welcome
and
alcinda
beamed
upon
them
as
they
entered
i
was
so
afraid
something
would
happen
to
keep
you
she
said
esther
ann
hurried
forward
to
talk
as
fast
as
she
could
as
was
her
habit
her
words
tumbling
over
one
another
in
her
effort
and
excitement
was
it
splendid
that
you
two
found
jetty
i
wish
we
had
gone
that
way
but
then
maybe
we
would
have
found
him
after
all
i
think
it
is
real
nice
of
alcinda
to
ask
reliance
when
she
is
a
bound
girl
you
this
in
an
aside
to
edna
i
sure
she
is
as
good
as
anybody
how
long
are
you
going
to
stay
here
i
show
you
where
to
take
off
your
things
you
need
go
alcinda
and
she
swept
the
little
hostess
aside
while
she
led
the
way
to
an
upper
room
by
this
time
the
latest
comers
had
arrived
so
there
were
about
a
dozen
in
all
enough
for
almost
any
game
they
might
choose
to
play
in
the
first
hide
the
handkerchief
jetty
joined
with
great
zeal
being
always
the
first
one
to
find
the
handkerchief
you
see
he
does
it
with
his
nose
said
alcinda
by
way
of
explanation
a
remark
which
made
everyone
laugh
and
set
the
lively
esther
ann
to
sticking
her
nose
into
every
corner
the
next
time
the
handkerchief
was
hidden
you
ought
to
put
cologne
on
it
and
then
maybe
we
could
find
it
she
said
and
this
too
raised
a
laugh
as
she
meant
it
should
for
it
took
very
little
to
amuse
them
at
five
a
tray
was
brought
in
delicious
cocoa
and
cakes
were
served
followed
by
candies
nuts
and
raisins
while
the
girls
were
busy
over
these
alcinda
cast
many
glances
toward
the
door
and
once
or
twice
whispered
to
her
mother
who
nodded
reassuringly
it
was
evident
that
some
matter
of
surprise
was
to
follow
what
it
was
came
to
light
a
little
later
when
hewlett
came
in
he
knew
each
little
girl
for
even
edna
was
no
stranger
to
him
so
he
spoke
to
each
by
name
then
he
stood
up
by
the
fireplace
and
said
you
have
all
heard
of
the
medals
which
are
given
for
the
performance
of
brave
deeds
well
my
little
girl
thinks
her
small
dog
would
like
to
show
his
appreciation
of
the
act
which
saved
his
life
the
other
day
and
so
i
have
prepared
two
medals
for
the
heroines
of
that
occasion
they
are
not
gold
medals
in
fact
they
are
not
real
medals
and
of
no
special
value
except
that
they
represent
her
and
our
gratitude
to
the
little
girls
who
were
the
life
savers
he
paused
and
looked
at
alcinda
who
bustled
forward
and
gave
into
his
hands
two
tiny
baskets
here
jetty
called
hewlett
and
jetty
who
had
been
sitting
in
hewlett
lap
jumped
down
and
danced
over
to
see
what
was
required
of
him
hewlett
stooped
down
and
gave
the
dog
one
of
the
small
baskets
which
he
took
in
his
month
with
much
wagging
of
tail
take
it
jetty
ordered
hewlett
jetty
started
off
toward
his
little
mistress
who
quickly
left
her
place
and
stood
by
edna
chair
jetty
dropped
the
basket
not
knowing
exactly
what
was
expected
of
him
bring
it
here
jet
said
alcinda
therefore
being
sure
of
himself
jetty
frisked
over
to
where
alcinda
was
standing
give
it
to
edna
said
alcinda
laying
her
hand
on
edna
lap
jetty
did
as
he
was
told
and
then
scampered
back
to
repeat
the
operation
this
time
it
being
reliance
to
whom
he
was
directed
to
go
do
let
see
urged
esther
ann
edging
up
to
edna
edna
uncovered
the
basket
and
saw
a
box
lying
there
inside
the
box
was
a
new
quarter
in
which
a
hole
had
been
drilled
a
string
had
been
passed
through
this
and
to
the
string
was
attached
a
bow
of
blue
ribbon
reliance
found
the
same
in
her
basket
only
her
ribbon
was
red
you
must
put
them
on
and
wear
them
said
alcinda
so
everyone
can
see
how
honorable
you
are
she
did
just
know
why
her
father
and
mother
smiled
so
broadly
the
girls
proudly
pinned
on
their
medals
and
wore
them
home
for
very
soon
came
grandpa
to
say
they
must
get
ready
to
go
i
going
to
keep
mine
forever
and
ever
are
you
whispered
reliance
as
she
started
around
to
the
kitchen
door
i
am
returned
edna
chapter
ix
the
elderflowers
edna
account
of
the
club
to
which
she
and
most
of
her
friends
belonged
had
quite
excited
the
ambition
of
the
little
girls
at
overlea
to
have
a
similar
one
i
told
my
father
about
it
said
reba
to
edna
when
they
met
at
party
and
he
thought
it
was
a
most
beautiful
club
did
he
esther
ann
and
he
ought
to
know
he
said
we
could
have
one
just
like
it
oh
we
do
want
to
do
that
put
in
esther
ann
scornfully
we
want
to
be
we
want
to
have
something
all
our
ownty
downty
selves
and
not
just
like
somebody
else
that
just
what
i
think
spoke
up
emma
hunt
not
that
i
do
think
yours
is
the
best
i
ever
heard
of
and
i
do
see
why
we
could
have
one
something
like
it
just
a
little
different
there
are
so
very
many
girls
of
us
for
there
are
more
old
people
than
children
in
this
place
said
alcinda
would
that
make
any
difference
edna
yours
is
such
a
big
club
it
was
big
when
we
began
there
were
only
six
of
us
to
begin
with

then
we
could
do
it
easily
let
me
see
how
many
are
here
one
two
three
four
five
six
seven
eight
nine
ten
eleven
and
there
is
mattie
bond

she
is
sick

reliance

very
lady

honorary
member

some
day
agnes
evans

our
first
president
and
she

be
nicer

ann

her
mind
but
what
shall
it
be
and
what
shall

call

alcinda
i
tell

i
will
ask
my
mother
what
she
thinks
and
we
can
meet
somewhere
to
talk
it
over
i
have
any
mother
came
a
sorrowful
little
voice
from
the
corner
big
reliance
put
her
arm
around
the
younger
girl
never
mind
letty
she
whispered
neither
have
i
but
we
can
ask
somebody
else
mother

lend
both
of
you
my
mother
whispered
edna
from
the
other
side
so
it
was
that
the
company
of
little
girls
went
home
from
jetty
party
with
quite
a
new
plan
even
edna
who
would
really
have
no
part
in
the
club
was
much
interested
and
could
scarcely
wait
to
talk
it
over
with
her
mother
at
bedtime
she
began
as
soon
as
they
were
upstairs
together
mother
she
said
do
you
think
grandma
would
let
reliance
come
up
while
i
am
getting
ready
for

over
with

edna
put
her
two
hands
on

very
earnestly

very
glad

any
little
girl
who
may
need
her
what
is
this
wonderful
something
you
are
to
talk
over
i
think
we
better
not
begin
until
we
know
about
reliance
though
i
wish
i
had
asked
grandma
before
i
came
up
but
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
first
mother
dear
then
i
will
go
down
and
ask
her
where
is
reliance
i
suppose
she
is
in
the
kitchen
with
amanda
i
do
believe
she
has
gone
to
bed
yet
her
mother
left
the
room
and
while
edna
unlaced
her
shoes
she
listened
for
her
return
in
a
few
minutes
she
heard
voices
on
the
stair
and
realized
that
reliance
was
coming
up
we
have
said
a
word
about
it
yet
she
nodded
to
reliance
who
came
in
behind
conway
you
begin
reliance
no
you
said
reliance
drawing
back
shyly
well
began
edna
addressing
her
mother
you
see
the
girls
want
to
get
up
a
club
something
like
ours
only
not
just
like
it
and
they
want
the
same
name
either
there
are
such
a
lot
of
girls
here
because
there
are
so
many
more
old
people
than
young
ones
in
this
village
and
so
you
see
what
kind
of
club
would
be
nice
mother
why
dearie
i
shall
have
to
think
it
over
we
ought
to
decide
very
soon
said
edna
for
i
should
hate
to
go
away
without
knowing
could
reliance
bring
letty
osgood
home
with
her
from
school
i
lent
you
to
her
too
and
maybe
by
that
time
you
might
think
of
something
we
ask
grandma
about
it
dear
though
i
am
sure
she
will
not
object
is
that
all
now
edna
thought
it
was
and
now
that
she
was
ready
to
pop
into
bed
reliance
left
her
with
a
happy
it
was
like
sunshine
in
the
house
to
have
such
a
dear
little
girl
as
edna
she
thought
as
she
went
downstairs
and
though
amanda
reprimanded
her
sharply
for
not
being
in
bed
she
did
not
answer
back
for
in
fact
she
scarcely
heard
her
so
busy
was
she
with
pleasant
thoughts
and
so
excited
over
the
idea
of
the
club
the
next
morning
edna
and
her
mother
did
a
great
deal
of
talking
about
the
new
club
so
much
in
fact
that
when
it
was
time
for
reliance
to
return
from
school
edna
was
on
the
lookout
for
her
feeling
that
she
had
so
much
to
tell
that
there
should
be
no
time
wasted
here
they
come
mother
she
sang
out
reliance
and
letty
may
i
bring
them
right
up
here
to
be
sure
you
may
i
going
down
to
tell
amanda
to
reliance
for
just
a
few
minutes
she
flew
downstairs
to
the
kitchen
she
said
mother
is
going
to
talk
over
something
very
important
with
reliance
and
letty
so
will
you
please
not
call
her
for
a
few
minutes
i
help
her
set
the
table
it
seems
to
me
you
are
making
too
much
of
reliance
returned
amanda
she
ca
be
brought
up
to
look
for
nothing
but
ease
and
pleasure
she
will
have
to
work
for
her
living
but
this
is
anything
that
is
going
to
keep
her
from
doing
that
explained
edna
and
grandma
said
she
could
have
a
little
time
to
play
while
i
am
here
specially
when
i
help
her
oh
well
go
returned
amanda
only
do
keep
her
too
long
there
more
to
do
than
set
the
table
though
the
permission
was
accorded
rather
ungraciously
edna
was
satisfied
and
ran
to
welcome
letty
who
was
just
coming
in
the
gate
i
am
so
glad
you
could
come
she
said
you
are
going
to
stay
to
dinner
are
you
did
you
ask
your
father
yes
and
he
said
i
might
good
then
come
right
upstairs
and
take
off
your
things
oh
girls
mother
has
a
lovely
plan
for
a
club
and
the
dearest
name
you
ever
heard
you
can
come
reliance
grandma
said
so
and
so
did
amanda
going
to
help
set
the
table
she
led
the
way
up
to
where
her
mother
was
sitting
her
face
bright
with
eagerness
as
she
brought
letty
forward
this
is
letty
osgood
mother
osgood
daughter
you
know
conway
drew
the
shy
little
girl
nearer
it
is
very
nice
to
see
letitia
osgood
daughter
she
said
i
knew
your
dear
mother
very
well
and
i
am
glad
to
have
my
little
girl
making
friends
with
her
little
girl
now
mother
began
edna
breaking
in
wo
you
please
not
talk
much
at
first
about
anything
but
the
club
because
reliance
has
only
a
few
minutes
to
stay
her
mother
smiled
and
nodded
to
letty
very
well
letty
she
said
well
have
a
nice
little
cozy
chat
all
to
ourselves
after
awhile
when
this
impatient
young
person
has
had
her
subject
discussed
i
was
thinking
girlies
that
as
long
as
there
are
so
many
elderly
and
old
people
in
the
village
some
of
whom
are
poor
and
some
who
are
partial
invalids
that
it
would
be
a
very
sweet
thing
if
you
little
girls
could
form
yourselves
into
a
club
which
would
help
to
make
their
lives
a
little
less
sad
it
would
mean
a
great
deal
to
old
miss
belinda
myers
for
instance
if
one
of
you
would
drop
in
once
in
a
while
with
a
flower
or
any
little
thing
for
her
she
is
so
crippled
up
with
rheumatism
that
she
ca
leave
her
room
and
must
sit
there
by
the
window
all
day
long
she
is
fond
of
children
too
of
course
she
has
plenty
of
this
goods
and
her
old
friends
do
not
neglect
her
yet
i
am
sure
that
you
could
give
something
to
her
by
your
mere
presence
which
none
of
the
older
persons
could
then
there
is
poor
old
nathan
keener
oh
but
he
is
such
an
old
cross
patch
interrupted
edna
so
he
is
but
he
has
had
enough
to
make
him
so
i
wonder
if
any
one
of
us
would
be
very
amiable
if
she
were
half
sick
all
the
time
had
lost
all
her
friends
and
had
been
cheated
out
of
the
little
which
would
make
old
age
comfortable
it
is
very
easy
to
be
smiling
and
agreeable
when
everything
goes
right
but
when
things
go
wrong
it
half
so
easy
especially
when
one
has
a
good
disposition
to
begin
with
but
what
in
the
world
could
we
do
for
him
asked
reliance
if
we
stopped
to
speak
to
him
very
likely
he
would
get
after
us
with
a
stick
did
any
of
the
boys
and
girls
ever
try
the
experiment
of
speaking
to
him
pleasantly
i
am
quite
sure
the
boys
do
their
best
to
annoy
him
in
any
way
they
can
contrive
and
even
some
of
the
girls
tease
him
slyly
and
call
him
names
i
am
told
yes
they
do
replied
reliance
doubtfully
who
herself
was
not
entirely
innocent
in
this
regard
suppose
you
were
to
try
the
experiment
of
beginning
by
smiling
when
you
go
by
and
saying
pleasantly
mr
keener
then
next
day
even
if
he
chased
you
away
the
first
time
you
might
say
this
a
lovely
morning
mr
keener
and
you
could
always
make
a
point
of
saying
something
pleasant
to
him
when
you
go
by
then
some
day
when
it
is
raining
or
too
cold
for
him
to
sit
in
his
doorway
like
a
great
big
ugly
spider
remarked
letty
conway
paid
no
heed
to
the
comment
you
could
leave
a
big
apple
on
the
doorsill
for
him
and
so
on
till
in
time
i
will
venture
to
say
he
will
learn
that
you
wish
him
well
and
are
trying
to
be
friends
you
must
keep
in
your
mind
all
the
time
that
he
is
a
poor
neglected
friendless
unhappy
old
man
and
that
if
you
can
succeed
in
bringing
even
a
little
sunshine
into
his
life
you
will
be
doing
a
great
deal
the
girls
were
very
sober
for
a
few
minutes
then
reliance
said
thoughtfully
i
believe
i
should
like
to
try
it
anyway
of
course
conway
went
on
the
girls
may
have
found
other
and
better
ideas
for
a
club
and
a
better
name
than
i
can
suggest
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
might
be
made
something
like
the
yet
would
not
be
exactly
the
same
and
it
could
have
quite
a
different
name
oh
mother
exclaimed
edna
do
tell
the
name
you
thought
of
i
think
it
is
so
lovely
i
thought
you
might
call
yourselves
elderflowers
because
your
good
deeds
would
be
directed
toward
your
elders
and
you
would
be
cheerful
little
flowers
to
bring
sweetness
to
sad
lives
i
think
it
is
the
most
beautiful
idea
exclaimed
letty
earnestly
and
i
shall
be
dreadfully
disappointed
if
the
girls
want
something
different
i
begin
to
feel
sorry
for
old
nathan
keener
already
that
is
an
excellent
beginning
said
conway
with
a
smile
here
came
a
call
from
amanda
so
reliance
and
edna
scampered
off
leaving
letty
to
be
entertained
by
conway
when
reliance
came
home
from
school
that
afternoon
she
brought
the
information
that
the
girls
were
going
to
meet
in
hewlett
old
blacksmith
shop
that
afternoon
and
that
edna
was
to
be
sure
to
come
to
her
own
great
disappointment
she
could
not
go
herself
for
amanda
declared
that
she
could
not
get
along
without
her
and
that
all
this
gallivanting
about
was
a
mistake
and
that
if
willis
was
going
to
have
a
bound
girl
there
for
her
to
bother
with
and
get
no
good
of
she
guessed
it
was
time
for
younger
folks
to
take
her
place
a
girl
that
spent
half
her
time
at
school
and
the
other
half
skylarking
amount
to
much
anyway
was
her
opinion
so
because
the
old
servant
had
to
be
pacified
and
because
it
was
a
day
on
which
reliance
could
really
be
ill
spared
she
did
not
attend
the
meeting
i
am
sorry
dear
said
willis
when
edna
begged
to
have
the
decree
altered
but
i
am
afraid
we
really
can
not
spare
reliance
this
afternoon
you
know
she
has
had
a
lot
of
time
for
play
this
past
week
we
have
been
very
indulgent
to
her
because
of
your
being
here
edna
saw
that
this
was
final
and
went
to
her
mother
with
rather
a
grave
face
mother
she
said
is
it
too
bad
that
reliance
ca
go
she
says
she
would
mind
so
much
if
it
were
not
for
the
voting
but
you
see
if
she
is
there
she
will
lose
her
vote
and
we
do
so
want
the
elderflower
plan
to
be
the
one
why
could
you
be
her
proxy
said
conway
proxy
what
is
proxy
mother
it
is
some
one
appointed
in
the
place
of
another
to
do
what
would
otherwise
be
done
by
the
first
person
for
instance
in
this
case
you
could
be
proxy
for
reliance
and
vote
for
her
she
could
sign
a
paper
which
would
make
it
very
plain
oh
mother
will
you
write
the
paper
and
let
me
take
it
to
her
to
sign
certainly
i
will
she
drew
the
writing
materials
to
her
and
wrote
a
few
lines
there
she
said
i
think
that
will
do
please
read
it
mother
conway
read
i
hereby
appoint
edna
conway
to
be
my
proxy
and
to
vote
upon
any
question
which
may
come
up
before
this
meeting
signed
that
sounds
very
important
said
edna
clasping
her
hands
show
me
where
she
is
to
sign
her
name
mother
i
know
she
will
be
perfectly
delighted
that
i
can
speak
for
her
reliance
truly
was
pleased
the
more
that
the
sending
of
such
an
important
legal
document
gave
her
a
certain
position
with
the
others
she
signed
her
name
with
a
flourish
and
edna
armed
with
the
indisputable
right
to
take
her
place
started
off
for
hewlett
old
blacksmith
shop
this
sat
back
some
distance
from
the
store
and
was
used
as
a
storage
place
for
empty
boxes
and
such
things
edna
found
most
of
the
company
gathered
when
she
arrived
they
were
all
chattering
away
with
little
idea
of
what
must
be
done
first
here
comes
edna
conway
cried
esther
ann
she
can
tell
us
just
what
to
do
come
along
edna
what
was
the
first
thing
you
did
when
you
got
up
a
club
we
had
a
president
and
a
secretary
the
first
thing
the
president
was
called
she
was
the
real
president
till
we
elected
her
then
you
be
for
you
know
just
what
to
do
oh
no
i
could
edna
shrank
from
such
a
public
office
and
her
little
round
face
took
on
a
look
of
real
distress
at
such
a
prospect
somebody
got
to
be
then
said
esther
ann
i
will
i
will
i
will
came
from
one
and
another
of
the
girls
too
eager
for
prominence
to
care
about
what
was
expected
of
them
we
ca
all
be
remarked
milly
somers
we
wasting
time
and
we
ought
to
have
had
this
all
settled
at
first
i
wish
there
were
some
older
person
to
get
us
started
everyone
is
here
yet
spoke
up
alcinda
is
reliance
coming
edna
no
she
ca
she
has
too
much
to
do
this
afternoon
but
i
am
her
proxy
i
got
a
paper
that
says
so
the
girls
giggled
is
she
cute
whispered
esther
ann
let
see
the
paper
edna
edna
solemnly
drew
it
from
the
small
bag
she
carried
and
handed
it
to
esther
ann
read
it
esther
ann
read
it
clamored
the
girls
and
esther
ann
read
it
aloud
how
in
the
world
did
you
know
about
such
a
thing
said
milly
somers
oh
i
did
think
of
it
she
answered
it
was
my
mother
she
must
be
awfully
smart
said
esther
ann
admiringly
i
wish
she
were
here
to
tell
us
just
what
to
do
if
you
wo
do
it
maybe
she
would
come
for
just
a
little
while
said
edna
feeling
assured
that
if
her
mother
were
there
to
tell
of
her
own
ideas
about
the
club
that
there
would
be
no
doubt
of
its
being
the
elderflowers
suppose
i
go
and
ask
her
she
added
all
right
agreed
the
girls
tell
her
if
she
will
stay
just
long
enough
to
tell
us
how
to
get
started
it
is
all
we
ask
edna
rushed
back
to
the
house
and
upstairs
where
she
breathlessly
explained
her
errand
you
will
go
wo
you
mother
just
for
a
few
minutes
she
begged
you
wo
have
to
change
your
dress
or
even
put
a
hat
on
if
you
do
want
to
we
need
you
so
very
very
much
nobody
knows
what
to
do
and
they
all
talk
at
once
and
giggle
and
say
silly
things
it
ought
to
be
real
serious
ought
it
not
too
serious
i
should
say
returned
her
mother
very
well
dear
i
will
come
she
threw
on
a
long
coat
and
followed
the
little
girl
across
the
street
to
where
the
prospective
club
members
waited
expectantly
it
did
not
take
long
to
set
the
ball
in
motion
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
esther
ann
was
made
president
milly
somers
was
appointed
secretary
and
the
business
of
choosing
came
up
there
were
not
very
many
original
ideas
offered
few
of
the
girls
had
any
conway
listened
to
them
all
and
at
last
explained
her
own
plan
so
clearly
and
with
such
earnestness
that
it
was
a
matter
of
only
a
few
minutes
before
it
was
decided
that
the
elderflower
club
should
start
its
existence
at
once
to
cap
the
climax
edna
was
elected
an
honorary
member
for
said
the
girls
if
it
had
been
for
you
we
should
never
have
had
a
club
at
all
and
when
you
come
to
your
grandfather
you
will
always
know
that
you
must
attend
the
club
meetings
therefore
it
was
a
very
happy
little
girl
who
went
back
to
report
to
reliance
the
happenings
of
this
first
meeting
of
the
club
chapter
x
what
ben
did
the
members
of
the
elderflower
club
were
so
eager
to
begin
business
that
they
could
scarcely
wait
till
the
next
day
the
more
retiring
ones
like
alcinda
contented
themselves
with
beginning
their
ministrations
to
relatives
or
those
they
knew
but
it
was
to
adventurous
spirits
like
esther
ann
and
reliance
that
a
difficult
case
such
as
old
nathan
keener
appealed
reliance
following
out
conway
advice
gave
a
cheery
mr
keener
as
she
went
by
his
dilapidated
house
on
her
way
to
school
she
reported
this
performance
to
the
other
girls
at
recess
oh
reliance
you
did
dare
did
you
exclaimed
alcinda
what
did
he
do
did
he
run
after
you
no
he
only
frowned
and
grunted
did
you
walk
very
fast
when
you
went
by
asked
little
letty
osgood
being
very
sure
that
she
would
not
have
loitered
upon
such
an
occasion
no
not
so
very
i
just
walked
as
i
always
do
then
i
think
you
were
very
brave
continued
letty
pooh
exclaimed
esther
ann
that
was
anything
to
do
just
wait
till
you
see
what
i
am
going
to
do
what
esther
ann
what
clamored
the
girls
wait
till
this
afternoon
and
you
will
see
was
all
esther
ann
would
say
to
satisfy
their
curiosity
this
being
friday
and
edna
last
day
at
her
grandmother
her
friends
begged
that
she
be
allowed
to
go
with
them
to
school
that
afternoon
we
do
have
real
lessons
reliance
told
her
for
miss
fay
reads
to
us
and
we
have
a
sewing
lesson
i
love
to
go
said
edna
and
i
could
take
the
work
bag
i
am
making
for
celia
i
could
finish
it
i
think
may
i
go
i
have
the
slightest
objection
conway
assured
her
so
she
set
off
with
reliance
and
felt
quite
at
home
since
she
knew
all
the
girls
of
her
own
age
and
older
and
as
she
said
the
littler
ones
count
everything
moved
along
pleasantly
during
the
school
session
and
the
girls
started
along
in
a
bunch
toward
home
you
just
come
with
me
edna
said
esther
ann
you
see
you
are
a
member
of
the
club
too
and
this
will
be
your
only
chance
to
do
a
deed
the
others
can
follow
along
if
they
want
i
tell
you
what
i
am
going
to
do
and
you
can
take
part
if
you
like
the
others
were
both
timid
and
curious
and
were
quite
content
to
obey
esther
ann
suggestion
to
follow
on
edna
it
may
be
said
was
not
inspired
with
that
wholesome
dread
of
old
nathan
which
possessed
the
others
for
she
had
not
been
brought
up
under
the
shadow
of
his
actions
and
she
felt
that
this
was
an
opportunity
which
she
could
not
neglect
she
trotted
along
valiantly
by
esther
ann
side
the
others
keeping
a
safe
distance
behind
tell
me
what
you
are
going
to
do
said
edna
to
her
companion
as
they
proceeded
on
their
way
for
answer
esther
ann
dived
down
into
her
and
produced
first
one
then
another
big
red
apple
i
am
going
to
give
these
to
nathan
you
can
give
one
i
mean
just
to
walk
right
up
to
him
and
say
you
have
an
apple
mr
keener
suppose
he
is
there
returned
edna
oh
he
be
there
he
always
is
when
it
is
a
bright
day
like
this
he
sits
in
an
old
chair
on
that
broad
doorstep
in
front
of
his
house
and
leans
on
a
big
thick
stick
he
always
carries
who
cooks
for
him
oh
he
cooks
for
himself
when
he
has
anything
to
cook
he
has
a
little
garden
but
it
does
amount
to
much
he
has
no
apple
trees
except
an
old
one
that
is
nearly
dead
and
never
has
but
a
few
little
measly
knerly
apples
on
it
that
why
i
thought
he
like
these
their
walk
was
carrying
them
nearer
and
nearer
the
old
man
door
there
he
is
now
whispered
esther
ann
i
go
first
and
you
come
right
up
behind
me
here
take
your
apple
she
thrust
the
fruit
into
edna
hand
and
hastened
her
own
pace
a
little
edna
heart
began
to
beat
fast
for
surely
nathan
keener
was
anything
but
an
attractive
figure
as
he
sat
there
glowering
and
muttering
his
gaunt
hands
resting
on
his
knotted
stick
and
his
grizzly
old
face
wearing
a
wrathful
look
true
to
her
guns
esther
arm
dashed
forward
and
held
out
her
apple
saying
in
a
shrill
excited
voice
wo
you
have
but
she
got
no
further
for
with
a
snarl
the
old
man
reached
out
one
long
bony
arm
and
grabbed
her
by
the
shoulder
raising
his
stick
threateningly
i
larn
ye
ye
little
varmint
he
began
esther
screamed
edna
paralyzed
with
fright
looked
on
with
affrighted
eyes
but
presently
found
voice
to
quaver
out
please
do
hurt
her
oh
please
do
the
other
girls
a
little
distance
off
stood
huddled
together
like
a
flock
of
sheep
no
one
was
brave
enough
to
venture
within
reach
of
that
terrible
stick
but
just
then
along
came
a
crowd
of
boys
from
school
the
foremost
took
in
the
situation
in
a
glance
and
in
another
instant
was
on
the
platform
by
esther
side
here
you
old
mut
what
are
you
doing
to
my
sister
he
cried
at
the
same
time
trying
to
wrest
the
stick
from
the
old
man
grasp
but
nathan
had
too
long
wielded
the
stick
with
effect
to
lose
it
so
readily
loosing
his
hold
upon
esther
he
swiftly
shifted
his
weapon
to
his
other
hand
and
brought
down
a
blow
on
the
boy
back
by
this
time
the
other
boys
had
come
up
there
were
cries
threats
screams
from
the
girls
shouts
from
the
boys
all
was
in
a
dreadful
when
along
the
road
approached
a
young
man
who
stood
for
a
moment
and
then
dashed
to
the
scene
of
battle
here
boys
here
he
cried
what
are
you
doing
to
that
old
man
he
was
going
to
beat
my
sister
spoke
up
the
one
who
had
first
hurried
to
the
front
you
old
scalawag
cried
the
young
man
what
were
you
up
to
if
you
are
yearning
to
hit
somebody
take
a
fellow
your
own
size
he
wrenched
the
stick
from
the
man
grasp
and
threw
it
away
now
he
said
have
it
out
if
you
will
i
ready
he
squared
off
but
the
old
man
had
neither
strength
nor
desire
to
grapple
with
such
a
masterful
opponent
and
he
slunk
back
against
his
door
i
guess
if
your
life
was
pestered
by
a
set
of
young
wretches
like
these
you
threaten
too
he
said
surlily
i
guess
i
getting
too
smart
for
their
tricks
and
know
enough
not
to
take
anything
they
offer
me
i
do
have
to
have
one
apple
full
of
red
pepper
set
on
my
doorsill
i
guess
i
know
who
hides
my
loaf
of
bread
and
puts
salt
in
my
can
of
milk
i
guess
i
cut
my
eyeteeth
a
good
many
years
ago
and
can
catch
at
their
tricks
the
young
man
looked
around
at
the
group
of
boys
now
rather
shamefaced
at
the
group
of
girls
now
gathered
around
esther
ann
on
the
edge
of
this
latter
group
he
recognized
a
little
round
face
now
and
affrighted
in
a
moment
he
was
by
edna
side
well
i
be
everlastingly
switched
he
exclaimed
edna
my
child
what
are
you
doing
in
this
oh
ben
returned
edna
it
was
all
a
mistake
nobody
meant
to
play
a
trick
come
over
here
and
tell
me
all
about
it
said
ben
leading
her
aside
edna
poured
forth
her
tale
of
woe
during
the
recital
of
which
more
than
once
ben
mouth
twitched
and
his
eyes
grew
merry
it
does
do
to
be
too
zealous
does
it
he
said
at
the
close
of
the
story
here
old
fellow
come
back
here
he
made
a
dash
at
old
nathan
who
was
now
retreating
within
his
own
doorway
ben
pulled
him
back
by
his
we
are
through
with
this
yet
he
went
on
as
the
man
turned
upon
him
with
a
few
smothered
words
that
is
a
pretty
way
to
talk
you
have
something
of
a
case
i
admit
but
you
happened
to
overreach
yourself
this
time
no
you
not
going
in
yet
a
little
more
fresh
air
wo
hurt
you
sit
down
there
and
be
good
and
i
will
tell
you
a
pretty
little
story
he
pushed
the
old
man
gently
into
his
chair
and
stood
guard
over
him
no
you
do
need
your
stick
yet
you
might
get
careless
with
it
i
just
lean
it
up
against
the
house
now
then
those
little
girls
had
a
notion
of
playing
you
a
trick
they
were
trying
to
do
you
a
kindness
they
knew
you
were
lonely
and
had
much
chance
to
run
around
with
the
boys
or
run
an
automobile
so
they
thought
they
would
chirk
you
up
a
little
by
presenting
you
with
a
large
sweet
juicy
red
apple
their
little
hearts
were
throbbing
with
they
had
an
unconquerable
desire
to
bring
a
smile
to
your
lips
and
a
gleam
of
happiness
to
your
eye
to
prove
this
to
you
i
will
now
dissect
this
large
sweet
juicy
red
apple
i
will
eat
half
and
you
will
eat
the
other
if
it
is
a
good
apple
i
eat
my
hat
he
carefully
cut
the
apple
which
edna
had
given
him
pared
and
quartered
it
stuck
a
piece
on
the
end
of
his
knife
and
offered
it
to
the
old
man
who
pushed
it
away
contemptuously
let
me
insist
ben
went
on
we
are
not
playing
adam
and
eve
in
the
garden
of
eden
there
is
no
serpent
in
sight
not
so
much
as
a
worm
and
if
you
find
so
much
as
a
grain
of
red
pepper
i
acknowledge
myself
beaten
the
old
man
muttered
incoherently
as
ben
finished
his
harangue
but
made
no
motion
to
take
the
apple
you
do
know
what
you
are
missing
ben
went
on
now
just
for
the
sake
of
old
times
let
try
to
be
jolly
and
remember
when
we
were
boys
why
many
a
time
you
and
i
have
raced
down
this
shaded
street
shouting
with
mirth
have
climbed
the
wall
by
the
orchard
and
stuffed
our
pockets
with
apples
like
these
you
never
could
take
a
joke
as
i
remember
but
still
you
were
a
bad
fellow
and
bet
you
were
a
wonder
at
baseball
i
should
wonder
if
your
batting
did
beat
the
town
the
way
you
swing
around
that
stick
of
yours
shows
there
is
in
the
old
land
yet
the
old
man
face
had
relaxed
a
little
and
he
no
longer
muttered
under
his
breath
ben
winked
at
the
boys
who
had
drawn
nearer
and
were
enjoying
the
situation
to
the
utmost
now
just
for
old
times
sake
continued
ben
just
tell
me
what
was
the
last
real
good
trick
you
ever
played
the
old
man
cast
a
look
at
the
smiling
young
man
by
his
side
but
made
no
reply
too
bad
you
forget
said
ben
but
i
bet
an
apple
to
an
oyster
you
do
forget
that
last
game
you
played
who
told
you
about
it
snapped
out
the
old
man
never
mind
do
you
suppose
such
a
game
as
that
will
ever
be
forgotten
i
going
to
tell
these
boys
all
about
it
some
day
see
if
i
do
nathan
wheeled
around
in
his
chair
and
glanced
over
the
row
of
young
faces
before
him
then
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
sighed
i
bet
you
would
mind
a
good
game
now
but
you
no
use
for
these
boys
and
they
have
much
for
you
when
the
next
game
boys
he
turned
to
the
row
of
faces
we
stopped
playing
baseball
for
this
year
came
in
a
chorus
do
have
football
up
here
no
we
have
any
team
too
bad
i
might
join
you
on
that
well
mr
keener
some
of
these
days
you
and
i
will
go
to
a
game
together
we
get
that
fixed
up
which
of
you
boys
was
it
who
so
doughtily
sped
to
the
rescue
of
the
young
maiden
jim
tabor
it
was
his
sister
the
old
man
was
after
piped
up
the
boys
all
right
and
mighty
little
respect
i
would
have
had
for
him
if
he
had
pitched
in
the
way
he
did
step
up
here
jim
jim
came
forward
a
little
awkwardly
the
other
boys
snickering
mr
keener
this
is
jim
taber
i
want
you
to
look
at
him
and
tell
me
if
when
you
were
a
boy
of
his
size
you
had
seen
anyone
threatening
your
sister
with
a
stick
you
would
have
pitched
in
and
fought
for
her
for
all
you
were
worth
you
were
any
slouch
in
those
days
when
it
came
to
fighting
i
know
that
all
jim
no
apologies
necessary
now
mr
keener
there
is
just
one
thing
more
i
do
believe
these
children
are
really
bad
only
mischievous
as
you
used
to
be
when
you
were
a
youngster
the
girls
i
know
are
all
ready
to
be
friends
bless
their
dear
little
hearts
as
for
the
boys
i
venture
to
say
we
can
patch
up
a
treaty
of
peace
with
them
if
you
will
promise
to
be
a
little
less
free
with
that
stick
and
not
get
a
grouch
on
you
every
time
a
boy
looks
your
way
they
will
promise
to
play
no
more
tricks
if
they
promise
i
give
every
mother
son
of
them
hail
columbia
when
i
come
this
way
again
and
by
his
looks
the
boys
knew
he
meant
what
he
said
they
were
conscious
that
ben
was
standing
up
for
old
nathan
and
yet
that
he
meant
to
be
perfectly
fair
to
them
ben
looked
up
and
down
the
line
well
he
said
the
boys
looked
at
one
another
if
he
promise
we
will
spoke
up
jim
taber
it
a
go
said
ben
now
mr
keener
it
up
to
you
old
nathan
gave
a
grunt
which
might
have
meant
anything
but
ben
chose
to
interpret
it
his
own
way
i
think
that
is
meant
for
assent
he
said
the
gentleman
seems
to
be
speaking
a
foreign
language
choctaw
i
should
say
or
maybe
hindostanee
however
it
is
all
right
now
mr
keener
allow
me
sir
he
opened
the
door
with
a
flourish
and
handed
the
old
man
his
stick
without
a
word
nathan
took
the
stick
and
went
in
ben
bowing
and
scraping
and
saying
thank
you
for
a
very
good
time
then
receiving
no
reply
not
even
a
grunt
he
added
not
at
all
the
pleasure
is
entirely
mine
the
door
closed
and
that
was
the
end
of
it
edna
came
running
up
oh
ben
she
said
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
oh
was
it
dreadful
how
did
you
happen
to
come
along
why
pinky
blooms
i
was
on
my
way
to
grandpa
thought
i
would
come
to
take
mother
back
and
as
it
was
a
fine
afternoon
i
concluded
to
walk
up
from
the
station
happened
by
just
in
the
nick
of
time
did
i
funny
old
curmudgeon
is
nathan
oh
he
is
terrible
responded
edna
with
a
remembrance
of
the
uplifted
stick
are
you
going
home
with
me
no
you
trot
along
with
the
rest
of
the
brood
i
am
going
to
stay
here
a
few
minutes
and
have
a
chat
with
the
boys
i
be
along
directly
so
edna
left
him
the
boys
crowding
around
and
asking
all
sorts
of
questions
ben
was
no
new
figure
in
the
town
and
most
of
them
knew
him
at
least
by
sight
just
what
he
said
to
the
boys
edna
never
knew
but
it
is
a
matter
of
comment
that
from
that
day
on
there
were
no
more
tricks
played
on
old
nathan
keener
and
though
the
big
stick
was
not
so
much
in
evidence
it
was
a
long
time
before
any
of
the
elderflowers
made
any
headway
in
winning
even
so
much
as
a
grunt
from
him
it
was
a
great
setback
to
the
enthusiasm
of
the
girls
but
as
reliance
told
esther
ann
she
should
not
have
tried
so
venturesome
a
thing
at
the
very
outset
conway
says
we
should
have
worked
up
to
it
gradually
it
just
like
training
a
wild
animal
you
have
to
win
its
confidence
first
but
esther
ann
declared
she
wanted
no
more
of
nathan
keener
and
reliance
was
perfectly
welcome
to
try
any
methods
she
liked
so
long
as
esther
ann
was
not
asked
to
share
in
the
effort
it
was
a
very
exciting
afternoon
taking
it
all
in
all
and
was
the
means
of
bringing
some
ridicule
and
some
censure
upon
the
little
club
one
or
two
of
the
girls
resigned
saying
their
mothers
did
not
approve
of
such
proceedings
all
this
however
did
not
happen
during
edna
thanksgiving
visit
but
she
heard
of
it
afterward
and
of
further
matters
concerning
the
elderflowers
chapter
xi
farewells
edna
had
not
finished
telling
her
mother
about
the
adventures
when
ben
came
in
the
family
had
gathered
in
the
edna
sitting
on
her
grandfather
knee
and
the
others
ranged
around
the
big
fireplace
there
comes
ben
now
edna
sang
out
catching
sight
of
her
cousin
figure
and
running
to
meet
him
halloo
young
man
was
grandpa
greeting
i
hear
you
have
been
having
a
with
nathan
keener
it
is
the
first
time
that
he
has
had
a
fisticuffs
with
a
member
of
this
family
he
and
i
used
to
be
continually
at
it
when
we
were
boys
together
oh
but
is
he
much
older
than
you
grandpa
said
edna
in
surprise
he
looks
like
a
very
very
old
man
and
i
do
that
a
nice
compliment
missy
no
he
and
i
are
about
of
an
age
and
went
to
school
together
in
the
little
old
red
schoolhouse
that
was
burned
down
some
years
ago
it
is
ill
health
and
trouble
that
makes
him
look
so
old
i
suppose
poor
old
chap
he
has
lost
most
of
the
friends
who
would
have
stood
by
him
for
he
has
taken
such
an
attitude
it
is
impossible
to
be
on
good
terms
with
him
ben
thinks
he
used
to
play
baseball
spoke
up
edna
did
they
play
it
so
many
many
years
ago
her
grandfather
laughed
they
certainly
did
and
he
was
tremendous
at
it
let
me
see
forty
fifty
years
ago
is
so
long
and
i
can
well
remember
the
time
the
overlea
boys
beat
the
boxtown
boys
and
it
was
all
because
of
nat
keener
good
playing
the
boxtown
fellows
thought
all
they
had
to
do
was
to
walk
in
and
win
but
we
gave
them
a
big
surprise
that
day
i
remember
how
we
cheered
and
after
the
game
was
over
carried
nat
around
the
village
on
our
shoulders
ben
smiled
and
nodded
as
if
this
event
came
within
his
recollection
too
edna
looked
at
him
in
surprise
why
ben
she
said
you
there
ben
laughed
no
but
i
heard
about
it
all
years
ago
and
it
came
to
my
mind
when
i
was
having
it
out
with
nathan
i
venture
to
say
he
is
thinking
more
of
those
old
times
at
this
very
minute
than
he
is
of
his
troubles
poor
old
nat
grandpa
shook
his
head
he
was
as
a
young
chap
as
ever
lived
but
uncontrolled
and
always
fighting
against
the
pricks
it
must
be
pretty
hard
for
him
pretty
hard
he
has
grown
so
morose
and
snappish
that
no
one
takes
the
trouble
to
do
more
than
nod
to
him
nowadays
he
was
a
bad
sort
too
free
and
too
fond
of
pleasure
maybe
he
does
have
much
chance
to
indulge
himself
there
in
these
days
remarked
grandma
false
friends
a
worthless
wife
and
a
bad
son
have
about
finished
up
what
he
had
with
good
money
after
bad
all
the
time
there
is
nothing
left
but
that
little
tumbledown
house
he
lives
in
what
does
he
live
on
asked
ben
ask
your
grandpa
answered
willis
smiling
across
at
her
husband
oh
pshaw
exclaimed
willis
nobody
counts
a
load
of
wood
or
a
bag
of
potatoes
once
in
a
while
i
must
stop
and
see
if
i
ca
draw
him
out
of
his
shell
some
of
these
days
talk
to
him
about
when
you
were
boys
grandpa
said
ben
that
will
fetch
him
just
here
reliance
came
to
the
door
to
say
that
ira
would
like
to
speak
to
willis
and
barker
appropriated
ben
so
edna
was
left
to
her
grandmother
and
her
mother
so
we
are
going
to
lose
our
little
girl
grandma
began
you
wo
be
left
without
any
little
girl
replied
edna
cheerfully
for
you
will
have
reliance
but
that
is
the
same
thing
as
having
my
own
little
granddaughter
responded
willis
no
returned
edna
when
are
we
coming
here
again
mother
why
my
dear
i
do
know
we
have
made
grandma
a
good
long
visit
this
time
it
is
what
i
call
a
long
visit
grandma
observed
when
i
was
a
child
i
spent
months
at
a
time
at
my
grandparents
i
spent
months
at
uncle
justus
but
then
i
was
there
at
school
remarked
edna
i
do
see
why
i
could
come
here
on
holidays
mother
you
can
do
that
sometimes
surely
we
have
promised
you
to
uncle
bert
for
the
christmas
holidays
but
maybe
you
could
come
at
easter
if
grandma
would
like
to
have
you
grandma
would
like
very
much
to
have
her
said
that
lady
even
if
i
came
without
mother
questioned
edna
even
if
you
came
by
your
own
little
self
we
shall
claim
her
for
the
easter
holidays
daughter
and
you
must
let
nothing
prevent
her
coming
if
it
is
not
convenient
for
any
of
the
rest
of
you
to
come
just
put
her
on
the
train
upon
which
marcus
brown
is
conductor
and
he
will
see
that
she
gets
off
safely
at
mayville
edna
looked
a
little
doubtful
at
the
idea
of
making
the
journey
by
herself
but
she
did
not
say
anything
however
grandma
went
on
i
do
see
why
celia
could
come
with
her
or
perhaps
ben
could
well
we
shall
see
responded
conway
well
try
to
get
her
here
in
some
way
then
we
shall
consider
that
quite
settled
said
grandma
with
a
satisfied
air
i
had
an
awfully
good
time
said
edna
thoughtfully
even
though
you
have
been
sick
abed
and
have
had
all
sorts
of
unpleasant
adventures
said
grandma
with
a
smile
i
was
so
very
sick
returned
edna
and
i
would
have
minded
that
except
for
the
mustard
bath
her
grandmother
laughed
well
hope
that
you
wo
need
one
the
next
time
i
did
mind
the
adventures
very
much
either
and
now
that
they
are
all
over
i
am
awfully
glad
that
i
will
have
something
so
interesting
to
tell
the
girls
at
home
i
think
a
great
deal
has
happened
in
the
time
i
have
been
here
do
you
grandma
from
the
standpoint
of
a
little
girl
i
suppose
that
is
true
though
it
has
seemed
such
a
very
exciting
time
to
the
rest
of
us
this
is
a
quiet
old
village
and
we
jog
along
pretty
much
the
same
way
year
in
and
year
out
without
very
many
changes
i
think
it
is
just
lovely
here
replied
edna
and
i
like
all
the
girls
too
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
them
again
i
sort
of
remembered
some
of
them
but
you
know
i
have
been
here
before
for
ever
so
many
years
and
i
had
forgotten
lots
of
things
even
about
the
house
and
the
place
then
do
stay
away
so
long
as
to
forget
anything
again
her
grandmother
charged
her
i
forgetting
that
this
is
the
last
chance
i
will
have
to
help
reliance
set
the
table
said
edna
jumping
up
she
found
reliance
had
already
begun
this
task
and
that
amanda
was
making
some
specially
good
in
honor
of
this
last
evening
she
was
in
a
good
humor
and
did
not
object
as
she
did
sometimes
to
being
in
the
kitchen
while
supper
was
being
prepared
just
think
remarked
edna
as
she
leaned
her
elbows
on
the
table
to
watch
amanda
where
i
shall
be
evening
at
this
time
and
are
you
sorry
asked
amanda
no
not
exactly
i
am
glad
and
sorry
both
i
should
love
to
stay
and
yet
i
want
to
see
them
all
at
home
that
perfectly
natural
amanda
returned
pricking
the
daintily
what
do
you
have
to
do
that
for
asked
the
little
girl
to
keep
from
blistering
amanda
told
her
there
open
the
oven
door
reliance
and
then
bring
me
that
bowl
of
cottage
cheese
from
the
pantry
i
did
know
as
it
would
be
warm
enough
to
allow
of
us
having
any
more
this
week
but
you
see
it
was
i
just
love
cottage
cheese
edna
made
the
remark
as
she
watched
amanda
pour
in
the
yellow
cream
and
stir
it
into
the
cheese
i
wish
we
kept
a
cow
so
we
could
have
all
the
milky
things
you
have
here
ai
your
place
big
enough
for
one
inquired
amanda
in
rather
a
surprised
tone
no
it
is
just
country
you
know
mcdonald
has
a
big
place
and
the
evanses
have
a
nice
garden
and
a
grove
of
trees
we
have
some
trees
and
some
garden
and
we
have
a
stable
but
we
have
any
pasture
for
cows
you
might
pasture
her
out
amanda
suggested
scraping
the
contents
of
the
bowl
into
a
glass
dish
here
reliance
take
that
in
and
set
it
on
the
table
and
then
go
after
your
milk
and
butter
the
dark
will
catch
you
if
you
do
hurry
i
going
too
announced
edna
i
can
carry
the
butter
but
i
bring
the
key
the
two
little
girls
laughed
for
this
was
a
standing
joke
between
them
they
started
out
through
the
rustling
leaves
to
the
the
leaves
gave
forth
a
queer
though
pleasant
odor
as
they
pushed
their
feet
through
them
a
big
star
blazed
out
against
the
pale
rose
of
an
evening
sky
over
in
the
cornfields
crows
were
calling
and
a
few
crickets
not
yet
driven
to
cover
by
the
frost
chirped
in
the
grass
the
cows
were
standing
in
the
stable
yard
they
had
been
milked
and
ira
had
brought
the
pails
to
the
before
this
the
little
white
kitten
which
edna
had
made
a
great
pet
of
followed
her
down
the
walk
frisking
away
after
a
falling
leaf
or
dancing
sideways
in
pretended
fear
of
its
own
tail
edna
picked
it
up
but
it
had
no
desire
to
stay
when
this
of
all
hours
in
the
day
was
the
best
to
play
in
so
it
scrambled
down
from
her
arms
and
was
off
like
a
flash
darting
half
way
up
a
tree
with
ears
back
and
claws
outspread
i
do
hate
to
leave
the
kitten
said
edna
i
hope
it
wo
miss
me
too
much
you
will
try
to
give
it
a
little
attention
even
though
you
love
the
grey
one
best
wo
you
reliance
reliance
promised
and
leaving
the
kitten
to
its
own
wild
antics
they
went
into
the
issuing
forth
with
the
various
things
they
had
gone
for
just
think
sighed
reliance
this
is
the
very
last
time
you
will
help
me
bring
up
the
things
i
shall
miss
you
awfully
edna
you
have
been
so
good
to
me
why
no
i
have
answered
she
you
have
been
good
to
me
coming
back
at
easter
reliance
and
it
will
be
so
nice
for
i
shall
have
so
many
questions
to
ask
about
the
girls
and
the
club
and
all
that
are
you
really
coming
at
easter
i
did
know
that
yes
mother
just
now
promised
grandma
i
should
goody
goody
i
must
tell
the
girls
when
i
see
them
the
girls
however
found
out
before
reliance
saw
them
for
knowing
that
edna
was
to
leave
in
the
morning
they
gave
her
a
surprise
that
very
evening
supper
was
hardly
over
before
reliance
trying
very
hard
to
smother
laughter
had
a
whispered
consultation
with
willis
who
after
it
was
over
came
back
to
her
place
by
the
fire
in
a
few
minutes
she
said
edna
dear
i
wish
you
would
go
up
to
my
room
and
see
if
you
can
find
my
other
pair
of
glasses
look
on
the
bureau
and
the
table
in
my
room
and
if
you
do
find
them
there
look
in
the
other
rooms
very
obediently
edna
trotted
off
upstairs
searched
high
and
low
looked
in
this
room
and
that
but
no
glasses
were
to
be
found
after
much
hunting
she
came
down
without
them
she
stepped
slowly
down
the
stair
humming
softly
to
herself
it
was
very
quiet
in
the
or
did
she
hear
whispers
and
subdued
titters
was
reliance
or
maybe
ben
going
to
play
a
trick
on
her
she
heard
a
sudden
hush
hush
as
she
reached
the
door
of
the
but
she
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
appear
perfectly
unconcerned
and
entered
the
room
in
a
very
sort
of
manner
i
could
find
she
began
and
then
stopped
short
for
there
ranged
around
the
room
were
twelve
little
girls
all
smiling
to
see
the
look
of
surprise
on
her
face
so
that
was
what
the
trick
was
we
a
surprise
party
spoke
up
esther
ann
and
we
a
party
too
added
reba
we
all
brought
you
something
alcinda
spoke
we
are
going
to
stay
an
hour
letty
added
here
esther
ann
darted
forward
with
a
bag
of
nuts
which
she
plumped
down
in
edna
lap
there
she
said
you
must
take
those
along
with
you
next
reba
presented
a
neat
little
book
it
looked
very
religious
edna
thought
but
the
cover
was
pretty
and
there
was
an
attractive
picture
in
it
alcinda
came
next
with
a
very
ornate
vase
which
edna
remembered
seeing
on
the
glass
case
in
hewlett
store
letty
brought
the
figure
of
a
cunning
cat
playing
with
a
ball
this
edna
liked
very
much
some
brought
candy
some
brought
cakes
one
brought
a
paper
doll
another
a
little
cup
and
saucer
but
each
one
had
something
to
contribute
till
edna
exclaimed
why
it
is
just
like
a
birthday
and
these
are
lovely
presents
oh
they
nothing
but
some
little
souvenirs
remarked
esther
ann
loftily
we
wanted
you
to
have
them
to
remember
us
by
i
shall
never
forget
you
never
said
edna
earnestly
and
i
thank
you
ever
and
ever
so
much
she
gathered
up
her
booty
and
piled
it
on
the
table
then
some
one
proposed
a
game
and
they
amused
themselves
till
grandma
sent
out
for
nuts
cider
apples
and
cakes
which
feast
ended
the
entertainment
though
it
is
safe
to
say
it
lasted
more
than
an
hour
at
the
last
the
girls
all
crowded
around
edna
to
kiss
her
and
to
make
their
farewells
and
then
like
a
flock
of
birds
they
all
took
flight
scurrying
home
by
the
light
of
their
lanterns
some
across
the
street
some
down
some
up
as
the
sound
of
the
last
merry
voice
died
away
edna
threw
herself
into
her
grandmother
arms
oh
grandma
she
cried
was
it
a
lovely
surprise
did
you
know
about
it
not
so
very
long
before
reliance
came
and
told
me
what
the
girls
wanted
to
do
and
i
promised
to
help
in
any
way
that
i
could
and
was
that
why
you
sent
me
up
for
the
glasses
i
did
tell
you
after
all
that
i
could
find
them
i
did
expect
you
to
said
her
grandmother
laughing
i
only
told
you
to
go
see
if
you
could
find
them
so
as
to
get
you
out
of
the
way
and
keep
you
occupied
long
enough
to
allow
the
girls
to
come
in
i
did
hear
the
front
door
shut
no
for
they
came
around
by
way
of
the
side
door
and
in
by
way
of
the
well
it
was
lovely
sighed
edna
in
full
content
although
the
real
farewells
had
been
said
on
that
evening
that
was
not
quite
the
last
of
it
for
the
girls
were
gathered
in
a
body
by
the
church
the
next
morning
when
edna
drove
by
on
her
way
to
the
train
she
was
squeezed
in
the
back
seat
of
the
carriage
between
her
mother
and
her
aunt
alice
ben
was
on
the
front
seat
with
his
grandfather
reliance
at
the
gate
was
waving
a
tearful
farewell
a
white
kitten
under
one
arm
and
a
grey
one
under
the
other
grandma
herself
stood
in
the
doorway
sounded
fainter
and
fainter
from
reliance
but
the
word
was
taken
up
by
the
girls
who
shouted
a
perfect
chorus
of
as
the
black
horses
trotted
nimbly
along
and
bore
edna
out
of
sight
chapter
xii
how
are
you
in
what
seemed
an
incredibly
short
time
edna
was
getting
out
at
the
station
nearest
her
own
home
ben
and
his
mother
had
parted
from
them
an
hour
before
and
were
now
on
their
way
to
their
own
home
ben
however
would
return
on
monday
to
take
up
his
college
work
again
there
they
are
were
the
first
words
edna
heard
as
she
and
her
mother
descended
from
the
train
and
then
the
boys
rushed
forward
to
hug
and
kiss
both
herself
and
her
mother
and
to
make
as
much
fuss
over
them
as
if
they
had
been
gone
a
year
gee
but
i
glad
to
see
you
cried
charlie
it
has
seemed
like
home
at
all
without
you
mother
did
you
have
a
good
time
at
mrs
porter
asked
edna
had
a
high
old
time
responded
frank
here

me
take
some
of
those
things
you
look
like
country
travellers
with
all
those
bundles
what
you
got
there
oh
things
returned
edna
vaguely
all
sorts
of
things
the
girls
gave
me
to
bring
home
you
look
like
a
regular
old
emigrant
with
so
many
boxes
and
bags
we
could
get
them
all
in
the
trunk
edna
explained
and
so
we
had
to
bring
them
this
way
when
did
you
get
back
frank
last
night
we
came
home
with
father
then
you
have
had
such
a
very
long
time
in
which
to
miss
us
said
conway
with
a
smile
well
it
seemed
like
a
long
time
returned
frank
nothing
ever
does
go
right
when
you
away
mother
what
special
thing
has
gone
wrong
this
time
asked
his
mother
oh
i
could
find
anything
i
wanted
this
morning
and
nobody
knew
where
anything
was
and
celia
did
know
how
to
fix
anything
and
all
that
conway
laughed
that
shows
how
i
spoil
you
all
i
am
afraid
i
missed
my
boys
too
and
am
glad
to
get
back
to
them
where
celia
asked
edna
she
home
we
all
came
up
together
last
night
lizzie
had
waffles
for
supper
and
frank
ate
ten
pieces
spoke
up
charlie

that
was
all
i
could
get

frank
in
an
injured
way
lizzie
said
there

no
more
oh
frank
frank
laughed
his
mother
well
at
any
rate
i
am
glad
to
know
my
absence
has
not
affected
your
appetite
tell
us
what
you
did
at
the
porter
said
edna
oh
we
just
racketed
around
we
went
to
a
fierce
old
football
game
and
we
did
all
sorts
of
stunts
in
the
house
steve
and
roger
have
a
fine
little
workshop
i
do
believe
i
like
living
right
in
the
city
though
we
boys
have
a
heap
more
fun
at
a
place
like
this
where
we
can
get
roger
and
steve
say
so
too
i
am
glad
you
are
so
well
content
observed
conway
there
celia
edna
sang
out
seeing
some
one
on
the
porch
watching
for
them
it
was
a
chill
wintry
morning
and
they
were
all
glad
to
hurry
indoors
to
the
warm
fire
the
house
looked
cozy
and
cheerful
yellow
chrysanthemums
in
tall
vases
graced
the
hall
and
library
in
the
latter
an
open
grate
fire
glowed
and
edna
looked
around
complacently
it
is
kind
of
nice
to
get
home
she
remarked
i
love
it
at
grandma
but
i
reckon
we
all
like
our
own
home
better
than
other
people
how
are
you
celia
tell
me
everything
that
has
been
going
on
at
school
how

i

agnes
gone
back
to
college
have
you
seen
miss
eloise

celia
what
a
lot
of
questions
i
wonder
if
i
can
answer
them
all
let
me
see
i
have
to
go
backwards
i
think
i
have
seen
miss
eloise
but
some
of
the
girls
have
she
and
her
sister
dined
at
the
ramseys
on
thanksgiving
day
i
know
they
had
a
good
dinner
then
remarked
edna
for
i
was
there
myself
last
thanksgiving
agnes
has
gone
back
to
college
dorothy
is
well
we
had
a
nice
and
i
missed
my
little
sister
dear
round
little
face
dorothy
has
been
so
impatient
that
she
can
hardly
wait
to
see
you
she
has
been
calling
me
up
at
intervals
all
morning
to
know
if
you
had
come
yet
there
is
the
telephone
now
no
doubt
it
is
dorothy
calling
edna
flew
to
the
and
celia
heard
yes
this
is
edna
oh
hello
dorothy
i
well
how
are
you
i
do
know
i
see
oh
no
you
come
over
here
that
will
be
much
nicer
i
have
some
things
to
show
you
what
that
yes
indeed
i
am
glad
to
get
back
then
a
little
tinkle
of
laughter
you
are
a
goosey
goose
i
not
going
to
tell
you
come
over
yes
right
away
if
you
want
to
dorothy
she
went
back
to
her
sister
and
established
herself
in
her
lap
putting
one
arm
around
her
neck
and
stretching
out
her
feet
to
the
warmth
of
the
fire
it
was
dorothy
she
said
that
was
quite
evident
my
dear
returned
celia
what
was
it
you
would
tell
her
oh
dorothy
is
such
a
goose
she
was
afraid
i
had
gotten
to
like
some
of
the
overlea
girls
better
than
i
do
her
just
because
i
wrote
to
her
about
reliance
and
alcinda
and
all
of
them
just
as
if
i
could
like
more
than
one
girl
do
you
think
it
is
silly
sister
for
anyone
to
want
you
to
have
no
other
friend
i
mean
no
other
best
friend
of
course
i
love
dorothy
dearly
but
i
love
jennie
too
and
i
am
very
fond
of
netty
black
and
oh
lots
of
girls
are
you
that
way
about
agnes
celia
celia
felt
a
pang
of
for
it
must
be
admitted
that
she
had
felt
a
little
jealous
of
the
new
friends
agnes
was
making
at
college
i
do
suppose
i
should
be
she
answered
after
a
pause
i
suppose
it
is
very
selfish
and
unfair
to
feel
that
way
about
it
mother
says
it
is
very
conceited
of
a
person
to
think
she
can
satisfy
every
need
of
a
friend
and
that
it
shows
only
love
of
self
and
not
love
of
your
friend
when
you
want
to
exclude
others
from
her
friendship
and
i
am
sure
i
do
want
to
be
either
selfish
or
conceited
and
i
should
hate
to
be
called
a
jealous
person
do
you
think
dorothy
is
conceited
and
selfish
i
do
think
she
means
to
be
but
when
she
wants
to
deprive
you
of
good
times
with
other
girls
or
is
jealous
of
your
friendship
for
them
she
is
encouraging
conceit
and
selfishness
i
glad
you
asked
me
about
the
way
i
feel
toward
agnes
for
it
makes
me
see
that
i
am
by
no
means
the
true
friend
i
ought
to
be
if
i
loved
her
as
i
should
i
want
her
to
have
all
the
good
times
all
the
love
all
the
benefit
she
could
get
from
others
and
i
mean
to
fight
against
any
other
feeling
but
the
right
one
i
do
believe
my
little
sister
will
be
the
jealous
kind
she
said
hugging
edna
up
if
you
see
me
getting
that
way
i
hope
you
wo
let
me
returned
edna
earnestly
there
dorothy
now
said
celia
putting
down
the
plump
little
figure
from
her
lap
and
edna
ran
out
to
greet
her
friend
there
was
so
much
to
talk
about
so
many
things
to
show
that
dorothy
must
needs
stay
to
lunch
a
little
later
over
came
margaret
mcdonald
to
say
how
do
you
do
and
to
bring
some
flowers
from
her
greenhouse
edna
tongue
ran
so
fast
and
she
had
so
much
to
tell
that
the
afternoon
seemed
all
too
short
dorothy
and
margaret
too
had
their
own
affairs
to
talk
about
and
it
was
dark
before
the
two
little
visitors
were
ready
to
go
the
next
excitement
was
the
coming
of
her
father
for
whom
dorothy
watched
and
who
appeared
almost
gladder
than
anyone
that
his
wife
and
little
girl
were
at
home
again
this
is
something
like
he
said
as
he
came
in
his
face
wreathed
in
smiles
you
poor
dear
said
edna
in
a
motherly
way
it
has
been
a
lonely
time
for
you
has
it
pretty
lonely
but
then
it
teaches
me
how
to
appreciate
my
family
when
they
get
back
my
my
my
what
a
difference
it
does
make
to
be
sure
i
do
think
i
can
stand
you
all
skylarking
off
again
very
soon
it
was
all
very
cozy
and
natural
after
dinner
to
be
back
again
in
the
library
conway
on
one
side
the
table
with
her
fancy
work
conway
on
the
other
with
the
evening
paper
the
boys
reading
or
scrapping
in
the
hall
celia
in
the
next
room
at
the
piano
and
edna
herself
with
the
children
page
of
the
paper
spread
out
before
her
where
she
lay
at
full
length
on
the
big
rug
before
the
fire
somehow
the
page
of
stories
and
puzzles
did
not
absorb
her
as
much
as
usual
she
wondered
what
reliance
was
doing
if
her
grandmother
felt
lonely
without
her
little
granddaughter
and
if
the
white
kitten
missed
her
she
saw
the
long
street
bordered
by
maples
the
store
and
the
postoffice
the
white
church
presently
she
got
up
and
went
over
to
her
mother
would
it
be
nice
she
said
if
one
could
be
in
two
places
at
the
same
time
her
mother
nodded
i
should
wonder
if
you
and
i
were
in
two
places
at
the
same
time
or
that
we
had
been
during
the
last
few
minutes
for
i
am
sure
while
our
bodies
are
here
our
thoughts
have
been
in
overlea
that
is
just
where
my
thoughts
have
been
answered
edna
do
you
suppose
they
miss
us
mother
i
am
afraid
they
do
very
much
said
her
mother
with
a
soft
little
sigh
i
know
if
either
of
my
daughters
ever
goes
away
to
a
home
of
her
own
i
shall
miss
her
very
much
when
she
has
left
me
after
making
a
visit
edna
stood
with
her
arm
still
around
her
mother
neck
this
was
rather
a
new
thought
once
her
mother
had
been
a
little
girl
like
her
of
course
and
had
stood
by
her
mother
side
just
like
this
and
now
she
was
living
in
quite
a
different
home
edna
tried
to
imagine
how
it
would
seem
to
come
back
to
this
her
childhood
home
from
one
of
her
very
own
but
it
was
entirely
too
difficult
a
matter
so
she
gave
it
up
and
went
back
to
her
paper
but
in
a
few
minutes
the
pictures
on
the
page
before
her
became
pictures
of
overlea
she
was
taking
the
key
to
old
nathan
keener
that
he
might
unlock
his
door
and
let
out
the
white
kitten
then
she
was
half
conscious
of
hearing
a
voice
say
no
never
mind
she
is
all
tired
out
i
carry
her
up
then
she
was
helped
to
her
feet
a
pair
of
strong
arms
lifted
her
up
and
she
was
borne
up
the
stairs
she
hardly
knew
who
undressed
her
and
stowed
her
away
in
bed
she
felt
a
soft
kiss
on
her
cheek
and
then
she
sank
into
a
deep
slumber
the
dear
little
girl
