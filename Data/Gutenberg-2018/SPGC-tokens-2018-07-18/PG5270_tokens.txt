camera
kennedy
and
i
had
been
hastily
summoned
from
his
laboratory
in
the
city
by
mackay
and
now
stood
in
the
luxurious
ornate
library
in
the
country
home
of
emery
phelps
the
banker
at
tarrytown
camera
you
know
the
call
when
the
director
is
ready
to
shoot
a
scene
of
a
picture
well
at
the
moment
it
was
given
and
the
first
and
second
camera
men
began
to
grind
she
crumpled
sank
to
the
floor
unconscious
hot
and
excited
mackay
endeavored
to
reenact
his
case
for
us
with
all
the
histrionic
ability
of
a
popular
prosecutor
before
a
jury
there
where
she
dropped
they
carried
her
over
here
to
this
davenport
sent
for
doctor
blake
but
he
could
do
a
thing
for
her
she
died
just
as
you
see
her
blake
thought
the
matter
so
serious
so
alarming
that
he
advised
an
immediate
investigation
that
why
i
called
you
so
urgently
before
us
lay
the
body
of
the
girl
remarkably
beautiful
even
as
she
lay
motionless
in
death
her
masses
of
golden
hair
disheveled
added
to
the
soft
contours
of
her
features
her
wonderfully
large
eyes
with
their
rare
gift
for
delicate
shades
of
expression
were
closed
but
long
curling
lashes
swept
her
cheeks
still
and
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
this
was
anything
more
than
sleep
it
was
inconceivable
that
stella
lamar
idol
of
the
screen
beloved
of
millions
could
have
been
taken
from
the
world
which
worshiped
her
i
felt
keenly
for
the
district
attorney
he
was
a
portly
little
man
of
the
sort
prone
to
emphasize
his
own
importance
and
so
true
to
type
he
had
been
upset
completely
by
a
case
of
genuine
magnitude
it
was
as
though
visiting
royalty
had
dropped
dead
within
his
jurisdiction
i
doubt
whether
the
assassination
of
a
mckinley
or
a
lincoln
could
have
unsettled
him
as
much
because
in
such
an
event
he
would
have
had
the
whole
weight
of
the
federal
government
behind
him
there
was
no
question
but
that
stella
lamar
enjoyed
a
popularity
known
by
few
of
our
presidents
her
sudden
death
was
a
national
tragedy
apparently
mackay
had
appealed
to
kennedy
the
moment
he
learned
the
identity
of
stella
the
moment
he
realized
there
was
any
question
about
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
affair
over
the
telephone
the
little
man
had
been
almost
incoherent
he
had
heard
of
kennedy
work
and
was
feverishly
anxious
to
enlist
his
aid
at
any
price
all
we
knew
as
we
took
the
train
on
the
new
york
central
was
that
stella
was
playing
a
part
in
a
picture
to
be
called
the
black
terror
that
the
producer
was
manton
pictures
incorporated
and
that
she
had
dropped
dead
suddenly
and
without
warning
in
the
middle
of
a
scene
being
photographed
in
the
library
at
the
home
of
emery
phelps
i
was
singularly
elated
at
the
thought
of
accompanying
kennedy
on
this
particular
case
it
was
not
that
the
tragic
end
of
a
film
star
whose
work
i
had
learned
to
love
was
not
horrible
to
me
but
rather
because
for
once
i
thought
kennedy
actually
confronted
a
situation
where
his
knowledge
of
a
given
angle
of
life
was
hardly
sufficient
for
his
usual
analysis
of
the
facts
involved
walter
he
had
exclaimed
as
i
burst
into
the
laboratory
in
response
to
a
hurried
message
here
where
i
need
your
help
you
know
all
about
moving
pictures
so
if
you
phone
your
city
editor
and
ask
him
to
let
you
cover
a
case
for
the
star
we
just
about
catch
a
train
at
one
hundred
and
street
because
the
film
world
had
fascinated
me
always
i
had
made
a
point
of
being
posted
on
its
people
and
their
activities
i
remembered
the
very
first
appearance
of
stella
lamar
back
in
the
days
of
general
film
when
pictures
were
either
licensed
or
independent
when
only
two
companies
manufactured
screen
dramas
when
any
subject
longer
than
a
reel
had
to
be
of
rare
excellence
such
as
the
art
films
imported
from
france
for
the
licensed
program
in
those
days
stella
rose
rapidly
to
prominence
her
large
wistful
eyes
had
set
the
hearts
of
many
of
us
to
beating
at
staccato
rate
then
came
lloyd
manton
her
present
manager
and
the
first
of
a
new
type
of
business
man
to
enter
the
picture
field
manton
was
essentially
a
promoter
his
predecessors
had
been
men
carried
to
success
by
the
growth
of
the
new
art
old
pop
belman
for
instance
had
been
a
oculist
who
rented
and
sold
stereopticons
as
a
side
line
with
blind
luck
he
had
grasped
the
possibilities
of
edison
new
invention
just
before
the
of
general
film
he
had
become
many
times
a
millionaire
and
it
was
then
that
he
had
sent
a
wave
of
laughter
over
the
entire
country
by
an
actual
cable
to
william
shakespeare
address
london
asking
for
all
screen
rights
to
the
plays
written
by
that
gentleman
manton
represented
a
secondary
phase
in
film
finance
continent
films
his
first
corporation
was
a
stockjobbing
concern
grasping
the
immense
popularity
of
stella
lamar
he
had
coaxed
her
away
from
the
old
studio
out
in
flatbush
where
all
her
early
successes
had
been
photographed
with
the
magic
of
her
name
he
sold
thousands
of
shares
of
stock
to
a
public
already
fed
up
on
the
stories
of
the
fortunes
to
be
made
in
moving
pictures
when
much
of
the
money
so
raised
had
been
dissipated
when
continent
quotation
on
the
curb
sank
to
an
infinitesimal
fraction
then
it
developed
that
stella
contract
was
with
manton
personally
manton
pictures
incorporated
was
formed
to
exploit
her
the
stock
of
this
company
was
not
offered
to
outside
investors
stella
popularity
had
in
no
way
suffered
from
the
business
methods
of
her
manager
manton
at
the
least
had
displayed
rare
foresight
in
his
estimation
of
public
taste
except
for
a
few
attempts
with
established
stage
favorites
photographed
generally
in
screen
versions
of
theatrical
classics
and
backed
by
affiliations
with
the
producers
of
the
legitimate
stage
continent
films
was
the
first
concern
to
make
the
feature
stella
as
a
continent
player
was
the
very
first
feature
star
under
the
banner
of
manton
pictures
she
had
never
surrendered
her
position
of
also
scandal
somehow
had
failed
to
touch
her
those
initiated
to
the
inner
gossip
of
the
film
world
like
myself
were
under
no
illusions
the
relations
between
stella
and
manton
were
an
open
secret
yet
the
picture
fans
in
their
blind
worship
believed
her
to
be
as
they
saw
her
upon
the
screen
to
them
the
wide
and
wistful
innocence
of
her
remarkably
large
eyes
could
not
be
anything
but
genuine
the
artlessness
of
the
soft
curves
of
her
mouth
was
proof
to
them
of
the
reality
of
an
ingenuous
and
very
girlish
personality
even
her
divorce
had
helped
rather
than
harmed
her
it
seemed
irony
to
me
that
she
should
have
obtained
the
decree
instead
of
her
husband
and
in
new
york
too
where
the
only
grounds
are
unfaithfulness
the
testimony
in
the
case
had
been
sealed
so
that
no
one
knew
whom
she
had
named
as
corespondent
at
the
time
i
wondered
what
pressure
had
been
exerted
upon
millard
to
prevent
the
filing
of
a
cross
suit
surely
he
should
have
been
able
to
substantiate
the
rumors
of
her
association
with
lloyd
manton
lawrence
millard
author
and
playwright
and
finally
scenario
writer
had
been
as
much
responsible
for
the
success
of
his
wife
as
manton
and
in
a
much
less
spectacular
way
it
was
millard
who
had
written
her
first
great
continent
success
who
had
developed
the
peculiar
type
of
story
best
suited
for
her
back
in
the
early
days
of
the
one
reel
and
general
film
it
is
commonly
known
in
picture
circles
that
an
actress
who
screens
well
even
if
she
is
only
a
moderately
good
artist
can
be
made
a
star
with
one
or
two
or
three
good
stories
and
that
conversely
a
star
may
be
ruined
by
a
succession
of
badly
written
or
badly
produced
vehicles
those
of
us
not
blinded
by
an
idolatrous
worship
for
the
girl
condemned
her
severely
for
throwing
her
husband
aside
at
the
height
of
her
success
the
public
displayed
their
sympathy
for
her
by
a
burst
of
renewed
interest
the
receipts
at
the
box
office
whenever
her
films
were
shown
probably
delighted
both
manton
and
stella
herself
i
had
wondered
as
kennedy
and
i
occupied
a
seat
in
the
train
and
as
he
left
me
to
my
thoughts
whether
there
could
be
any
connection
between
the
tragedy
and
the
divorce
the
decree
i
knew
was
not
yet
final
could
it
be
possible
that
millard
was
unwilling
after
all
to
surrender
her
could
he
prefer
deliberate
murder
to
granting
her
her
freedom
i
was
compelled
to
drop
that
line
of
thought
since
it
offered
no
explanation
of
his
previous
failure
to
contest
her
suit
or
to
start
counter
action
then
my
reflections
had
strayed
away
from
kennedy
sphere
the
solving
of
the
mystery
to
my
own
the
news
value
of
her
death
and
the
events
following
the
star
as
always
had
been
only
too
glad
to
assign
me
to
any
case
where
craig
kennedy
was
concerned
my
phone
message
to
the
city
editor
the
first
intimation
to
any
new
york
paper
of
death
already
had
resulted
without
doubt
in
scare
heads
and
an
extra
edition
the
thought
of
the
prominence
given
the
personal
affairs
of
picture
players
and
theatrical
folk
had
disgusted
me
there
are
stars
against
whom
there
is
not
the
slightest
breath
of
gossip
even
among
the
studio
any
number
of
girls
and
men
go
about
their
work
sanely
and
seriously
concerned
in
nothing
but
their
success
and
the
pursuit
of
normal
pleasures
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
had
struck
me
on
the
train
that
this
was
about
the
first
time
craig
kennedy
had
ever
been
called
in
upon
a
case
even
remotely
connected
with
the
picture
field
i
knew
he
would
be
confronted
with
a
tangled
skein
of
idle
talk
from
everybody
about
everybody
and
mostly
without
justification
i
hoped
he
would
not
fall
into
the
popular
error
of
assuming
all
film
players
bad
all
studios
schools
of
immorality
i
was
glad
i
was
able
to
accompany
him
on
that
account
the
arrival
at
tarrytown
had
ended
my
reflections
and
kennedy
whatever
they
may
have
been
mackay
himself
had
met
us
at
the
station
and
with
a
few
words
to
cover
his
nervousness
had
whisked
us
out
to
the
house
as
we
approached
kennedy
had
taken
quick
note
of
the
surroundings
the
location
of
the
home
itself
the
arrangement
of
the
grounds
there
was
a
spreading
lawn
on
all
four
sides
unbroken
by
plant
or
bush
or
tree
sheer
prodigality
of
space
the
better
to
display
a
rambling
but
most
artistic
pile
of
gray
granite
masking
the
road
and
the
adjoining
grounds
was
thick
impenetrable
shrubbery
a
ring
of
miniature
forest
land
about
the
estate
there
was
a
garage
set
back
and
tennis
courts
and
a
practice
golf
green
in
the
center
of
a
garden
in
a
far
corner
a
summerhouse
was
placed
so
as
to
reflect
itself
in
the
surface
of
a
glistening
swimming
pool
as
we
pulled
up
under
the
emery
phelps
the
banker
greeted
us
perhaps
it
was
my
imagination
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
a
repressed
animosity
in
his
manner
as
though
he
resented
the
intrusion
of
kennedy
and
myself
yet
felt
powerless
to
prevent
it
in
contrast
to
his
manner
was
the
cordiality
of
lloyd
manton
just
inside
the
door
manton
was
childishly
eager
in
his
welcome
so
much
so
that
i
was
able
to
detect
a
shade
of
suspicion
in
kennedy
face
the
others
of
the
company
were
clustered
in
the
living
room
through
which
we
passed
to
reach
the
library
i
found
small
opportunity
to
study
them
in
the
rather
dim
light
mackay
beckoned
to
a
man
standing
in
a
window
presenting
him
to
kennedy
as
doctor
blake
then
we
entered
the
long
paneled
chamber
which
had
been
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
now
i
stood
rather
awed
with
the
motionless
figure
of
stella
lamar
before
me
in
her
last
pitiable
for
i
have
never
lost
the
sense
of
solemnity
on
entering
the
room
of
a
tragedy
in
spite
of
the
long
association
i
have
had
with
kennedy
in
the
scientific
detection
of
crime
particularly
did
i
have
the
feeling
in
this
case
the
death
of
a
man
is
tragic
but
i
know
nothing
more
affecting
than
the
sudden
and
violent
death
of
a
beautiful
woman
unless
it
be
that
of
a
child
i
recalled
a
glimpse
of
stella
as
i
had
seen
her
in
her
most
recent
release
as
the
diaphragm
opened
on
her
receiving
a
box
of
chocolates
sent
by
her
lover
and
playfully
feeding
one
of
them
to
her
beautiful
collie
laddie
as
he
romped
about
upon
a
divan
and
almost
smothered
her
with
affection
the
vivacity
and
charm
of
the
scene
were
in
sad
contrast
with
what
lay
before
me
as
i
looked
more
carefully
i
saw
now
that
her
full
face
was
contorted
with
either
pain
or
fear
perhaps
both
even
through
the
one
could
see
that
her
face
was
blotched
and
swollen
also
the
muscles
were
contorted
the
eyes
looked
as
if
they
might
be
bulging
under
the
lids
and
there
was
a
bluish
tinge
to
her
skin
evidently
death
had
come
quickly
but
it
had
not
been
painless
even
the
coroner
has
not
disturbed
the
body
mackay
hastened
to
explain
to
kennedy
the
players
the
camera
men
all
were
sent
out
of
the
room
the
moment
doctor
blake
was
certain
something
more
than
a
natural
cause
lay
behind
her
death
phelps
telephoned
to
me
and
upon
my
arrival
i
ordered
the
doors
and
windows
closed
posted
my
deputies
to
prevent
any
interference
with
anything
in
the
room
left
my
instructions
that
everyone
was
to
be
detained
then
got
in
touch
with
you
as
quickly
as
i
could
kennedy
turned
to
him
something
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
showed
that
he
meant
his
compliment
i
glad
mackay
to
be
called
in
by
some
one
who
knows
enough
not
to
destroy
evidence
who
realizes
that
perhaps
the
slightest
disarrangement
of
a
rug
for
instance
may
be
the
only
clue
to
a
murder
it
it
rare
the
little
district
attorney
beamed
if
he
had
found
it
necessary
to
walk
across
the
floor
just
then
he
would
have
strutted
i
smiled
because
i
wanted
kennedy
to
show
again
his
marvelous
skill
in
tracing
a
crime
to
its
perpetrator
i
was
anxious
that
nothing
should
be
done
to
hamper
him
ii
the
tiny
scratch
kennedy
before
his
own
examination
of
the
body
turned
to
doctor
blake
tell
me
just
what
you
found
when
you
arrived
he
directed
the
physician
whose
practice
embraced
most
of
the
wealthy
families
in
and
around
tarrytown
was
an
unusually
tall
man
of
evident
competency
it
was
very
plain
that
he
resented
his
unavoidable
connection
with
the
case
she
was
still
alive
he
responded
thoughtfully
although
breathing
with
difficulty
nearly
everyone
had
clustered
about
her
so
that
she
was
getting
little
air
and
the
room
was
stuffy
from
the
lights
they
had
been
using
in
taking
the
scene
they
told
me
she
dropped
unconscious
and
that
they
could
revive
her
but
at
first
it
did
not
occur
to
me
that
it
might
be
serious
i
thought
perhaps
the
heat
you
saw
nothing
suspicious
interrupted
kennedy
nothing
in
the
actions
or
manner
of
anyone
in
the
room
no
when
i
first
entered
i
did
suspect
anything
out
of
the
way
i
had
them
send
everyone
into
the
next
room
except
manton
and
phelps
and
had
the
doors
and
windows
thrown
open
to
give
her
air
then
when
i
examined
her
i
detected
what
seemed
to
me
to
be
both
a
muscular
and
nervous
paralysis
which
by
that
time
had
proceeded
pretty
far
as
i
touched
her
she
opened
her
eyes
but
she
was
unable
to
speak
she
was
breathing
with
difficulty
her
heart
action
was
weakening
so
rapidly
that
i
had
little
opportunity
to
apply
restorative
measures
what
do
you
think
caused
the
death
so
far
i
can
make
no
satisfactory
explanation
the
doctor
shrugged
his
shoulders
very
slightly
that
is
why
i
advised
an
immediate
investigation
i
did
not
care
to
write
a
death
certificate
you
have
no
hypothesis
if
she
died
from
any
natural
organic
disorder
the
signs
were
lacking
by
which
i
could
trace
it
everything
indicates
the
opposite
however
it
would
be
hard
for
me
to
say
whether
the
paralysis
of
respiration
or
of
the
heart
actually
caused
her
death
if
it
was
due
to
poison
well
to
me
the
whole
affair
is
shrouded
in
mystery
the
symptoms
indicated
nothing
i
could
recognize
with
any
degree
of
certainty
kennedy
stooped
over
making
a
superficial
examination
of
the
girl
i
saw
that
some
faint
odor
caught
his
nostrils
for
he
remained
poised
a
moment
inhaling
reflectively
his
eyes
clouded
in
thought
then
he
went
to
the
windows
raising
the
shades
an
additional
few
inches
each
but
that
did
not
seem
to
give
him
the
light
he
wished
in
the
room
were
the
portable
arcs
used
in
the
making
of
scenes
in
an
actual
interior
setting
the
connections
ran
to
heavy
insulated
junction
boxes
at
the
ends
of
two
lines
of
stiff
black
stage
cable
near
the
door
the
circuits
were
joined
and
a
single
lead
of
the
big
duplex
cord
ran
out
along
the
polished
hardwood
floor
carried
presumably
to
the
house
circuit
at
a
fuse
box
where
sufficient
amperage
was
available
kennedy
eyes
followed
out
the
wires
quickly
then
motioning
to
me
to
help
he
wheeled
one
of
the
heavy
stands
around
and
adjusted
the
hood
so
that
the
full
strength
of
the
light
would
be
cast
upon
stella
the
arc
in
place
he
threw
the
switch
and
in
the
sputtering
flood
of
illumination
dropped
to
his
knees
taking
a
powerful
pocket
lens
from
his
waistcoat
and
beginning
an
inch
by
inch
examination
of
her
skin
i
gained
a
fresh
realization
of
the
beauty
of
the
star
as
she
lay
under
the
dazzling
electric
glow
and
in
particular
i
noticed
the
small
amount
of
she
had
used
and
the
natural
firmness
of
her
flesh
she
was
dressed
in
a
modish
informal
dinner
dress
of
embroidered
satin
cut
fairly
low
at
front
and
back
and
with
sleeves
of
some
gauzelike
material
reaching
not
halfway
to
her
elbow
hardly
sleeves
at
all
in
fact
kennedy
with
his
glass
went
over
her
features
with
extreme
care
i
saw
that
he
drew
her
hair
back
and
that
then
he
parted
it
to
examine
her
scalp
and
i
wondered
what
infinitesimal
clue
might
be
the
object
of
his
search
i
had
learned
however
never
to
question
him
while
he
was
at
work
with
his
eye
glued
to
his
lens
he
made
his
way
about
and
around
her
neck
and
down
and
over
her
throat
and
chest
so
far
as
it
remained
unprotected
by
the
silk
of
her
gown
with
the
aid
of
mackay
he
turned
her
over
to
examine
her
back
next
he
returned
the
body
to
its
former
position
and
began
to
inspect
the
arms
very
suddenly
something
caught
his
eye
on
the
inside
of
her
right
forearm
he
grunted
with
satisfaction
straightened
pulled
the
switch
of
the
arc
wiped
his
eyes
which
were
watering
find
anything
mr
kennedy
doctor
blake
seemed
to
understand
to
some
extent
the
purpose
of
the
examination
kennedy
did
not
answer
probably
preoccupied
with
theories
which
i
could
see
were
forming
in
his
mind
the
library
was
a
huge
room
of
greater
length
than
breadth
at
one
end
were
wide
french
windows
looking
out
upon
the
garden
and
summer
house
the
door
to
the
hallway
and
living
room
was
very
broad
with
heavy
sliding
panels
and
rich
portieres
of
a
velours
almost
the
tint
of
the
between
the
door
situated
in
the
side
wall
near
the
opposite
end
and
the
windows
was
a
magnificent
stone
fireplace
with
charred
logs
testifying
to
its
frequent
use
the
couch
where
stella
lay
had
been
drawn
back
from
its
normal
position
before
the
fire
together
with
a
huge
table
of
carved
walnut
the
other
two
walls
were
an
unbroken
succession
of
shelves
reaching
to
the
ceiling
and
literally
packed
with
books
facing
the
windows
and
the
door
so
as
to
include
the
fireplace
and
the
wide
sweep
of
the
room
within
range
were
two
cameras
still
set
up
the
legs
of
their
tripods
nested
probably
left
exactly
as
they
were
at
the
moment
of
stella
collapse
i
touched
the
handle
of
one
a
bell
howell
and
saw
that
it
was
threaded
that
the
film
had
not
been
disturbed
the
lights
staggered
and
falling
away
from
the
camera
lines
were
arranged
to
focus
their
illumination
on
the
action
of
the
scenes
there
were
four
arcs
and
two
small
portable
banks
of
the
latter
used
to
cut
the
sharp
shadows
and
give
a
greater
evenness
to
the
photography
also
there
were
diffusers
constructed
of
sheets
of
white
cloth
stretched
taut
on
frames
these
reflected
light
upward
upon
the
faces
of
the
actors
softening
the
lower
features
and
so
valuable
in
adding
to
the
attractiveness
of
the
women
in
particular
all
this
i
had
learned
from
visits
to
a
studio
with
the
photoplay
editor
i
was
anxious
to
impress
my
knowledge
upon
kennedy
he
gave
me
no
opportunity
however
but
wheeled
upon
mackay
suddenly
send
in
the
electrician
he
ordered
keep
everyone
else
out
until
i
ready
to
examine
them
while
the
district
attorney
hurried
to
the
sliding
doors
guarded
on
their
farther
side
by
one
of
the
amateur
deputies
he
had
impressed
into
service
kennedy
swung
the
stand
of
the
arc
he
had
used
back
into
the
place
unaided
i
noticed
that
doctor
blake
was
nervously
interested
in
spite
of
his
professional
poise
i
certainly
was
bursting
with
curiosity
to
know
what
kennedy
had
found
the
electrician
a
wizened
veteran
of
the
studios
with
a
bald
head
which
glistened
rather
ridiculously
entered
as
though
he
expected
to
be
held
for
the
death
of
the
star
on
the
spot
i
do
know
nothin
he
began
before
anyone
could
start
to
question
him
i
was
outside
when
they
yelled
honest
i
was
seeing
whether
was
getting
hot
and
i
heard
call
to
douse
the
glim
an
put
on
all
your
lights
kennedy
was
unusually
sharp
although
it
was
plain
he
held
no
suspicion
of
this
man
as
he
added
just
as
you
had
them
as
the
electrician
went
from
stand
to
stand
sulkily
there
was
a
sputter
from
the
arcs
almost
deafening
in
the
confines
of
the
room
and
quite
a
bit
of
fine
white
smoke
but
in
a
moment
the
corner
of
the
library
constituting
the
set
was
brilliantly
dazzlingly
lighted
to
me
it
was
quite
like
being
transported
into
one
of
the
big
studios
in
the
city
is
this
the
largest
portion
of
the
room
they
used
kennedy
asked
did
you
have
your
stands
any
farther
back
this
was
the
biggest
sir
replied
the
man
were
all
the
scenes
in
which
miss
lamar
appeared
before
her
death
in
this
corner
of
the
room
yes
sir
and
this
was
the
way
you
had
the
scene
lighted
when
she
dropped
unconscious
yes
sir
i
pulled
an
an
they
lifted
her
up
and
put
her
right
there
where
she
is
sir
kennedy
paid
no
attention
to
the
last
in
fact
i
doubt
whether
he
heard
it
dropping
to
hands
and
knees
immediately
he
began
a
search
of
the
floor
and
carpet
as
minutely
painstaking
as
the
inspection
he
had
given
stella
own
person
instinctively
i
drew
back
to
be
out
of
his
way
as
did
doctor
blake
and
mackay
the
electrician
i
noticed
seemed
to
grasp
now
the
reason
for
the
summons
which
undoubtedly
had
frightened
him
badly
he
gave
his
attention
to
his
lights
stroking
a
refractory
tube
for
all
the
world
as
if
some
minor
scene
in
the
story
were
being
photographed
it
was
hard
to
realize
that
it
was
not
another
picture
scene
but
that
craig
kennedy
in
my
opinion
the
founder
of
the
scientific
school
of
modern
detectives
was
searching
out
in
this
strange
environment
the
clue
to
a
real
murder
so
mysterious
that
the
very
cause
of
death
was
as
yet
undetermined
i
was
hoping
for
a
display
of
the
remarkable
brilliance
craig
had
shown
in
so
many
of
the
cases
brought
to
his
attention
i
half
expected
to
see
him
rise
from
the
floor
with
some
tiny
something
in
his
hand
some
object
overlooked
by
everyone
else
some
tangible
evidence
which
would
lead
to
the
immediate
apprehension
of
the
perpetrator
of
the
crime
that
stella
lamar
had
met
her
death
by
foul
means
i
did
not
doubt
for
an
instant
and
so
i
waited
feverishly
for
the
conclusion
of
search
as
it
happened
this
was
not
destined
to
be
one
of
his
cases
cleared
up
in
a
brief
few
hours
of
intensive
effort
he
covered
every
inch
of
the
floor
within
the
illuminated
area
then
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
walls
and
furniture
and
the
rest
of
the
room
in
somewhat
more
perfunctory
but
no
less
skillful
manner
fully
fifteen
minutes
elapsed
but
i
knew
from
his
expression
that
he
had
discovered
nothing
in
a
wringing
perspiration
from
the
heat
of
the
arcs
but
nevertheless
glad
to
have
had
the
intense
light
at
his
disposal
he
motioned
to
the
electrician
to
turn
them
off
and
to
leave
the
room
find
anything
mr
kennedy
queried
the
physician
once
more
kennedy
beckoned
all
of
us
to
the
side
of
the
actress
lifting
the
right
arm
finding
the
spot
which
had
caused
his
exclamation
before
he
handed
his
pocket
lens
to
doctor
blake
after
a
moment
a
low
whistle
escaped
the
lips
of
the
physician
next
it
was
my
turn
as
i
stooped
over
i
caught
above
the
faint
scent
of
imported
perfume
which
she
affected
a
peculiar
putrescent
odor
this
it
was
which
had
caught
kennedy
nostrils
then
through
the
glass
i
could
detect
upon
her
forearm
the
tiniest
possible
scratch
ending
in
an
almost
invisible
puncture
such
as
might
have
been
made
by
a
very
sharp
needle
or
the
point
of
an
incredibly
fine
hypodermic
syringe
drawing
back
i
glanced
again
at
her
face
which
i
had
already
noted
was
blotched
and
somewhat
swollen
beneath
the
again
i
thought
that
the
muscles
were
contorted
that
the
eyes
were
bulging
slightly
that
there
was
a
bluish
tinge
to
her
skin
such
as
in
cyanosis
or
asphyxiation
it
may
have
been
imagination
but
i
was
now
sure
that
her
expression
revealed
pain
or
fear
or
both
when
i
looked
at
her
first
i
had
been
unable
to
forget
my
impression
of
years
before
me
there
had
been
the
once
living
form
of
stella
lamar
whom
i
had
dreamed
of
meeting
and
whom
i
had
never
viewed
in
actual
life
i
had
lacked
the
penetration
to
see
beneath
the
glamour
but
to
kennedy
there
had
been
signs
of
the
poisoning
at
once
doctor
blake
had
searched
merely
for
the
evidences
of
the
commoner
drugs
or
the
usual
diseases
such
as
cause
sudden
death
i
recalled
the
cyanides
i
thought
of
curare
or
woorali
the
south
american
arrow
poison
with
which
kennedy
once
had
dealt
had
stella
received
an
injection
of
some
new
and
curious
substance
mackay
glanced
up
from
his
inspection
of
the
mark
on
the
arm
it
an
awfully
tiny
scratch
he
exclaimed
kennedy
smiled
yet
mackay
it
probably
was
the
cause
of
her
death
how
that
that
is
the
problem
before
us
when
we
learn
just
exactly
how
she
scratched
herself
or
was
scratched
kennedy
paced
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
fireplace
then
he
confronted
each
of
us
in
turn
suddenly
serious
not
a
word
of
what
i
have
discovered
he
warned
iii
tangled
motives
do
you
wish
to
examine
the
people
now
mackay
asked
kennedy
hesitated
first
i
want
to
make
sure
of
the
evidence
concerning
her
actual
death
can
you
arrange
to
have
the
clothes
she
has
on
and
those
she
brought
with
her
all
of
them
bundled
up
and
sent
in
to
my
laboratory
together
with
samples
of
her
body
fluids
as
soon
as
the
coroner
can
supply
you
mackay
nodded
this
pleased
him
this
seemed
to
be
tangible
action
promising
tangible
results
again
kennedy
glanced
about
in
thought
i
knew
that
the
scratch
was
worrying
him
did
she
change
her
clothes
out
here
he
inquired
the
district
attorney
brightened
she
dressed
in
a
small
den
just
off
the
living
room
i
have
a
man
posted
and
the
door
closed
nothing
has
been
disturbed
he
started
to
lead
the
way
without
further
word
from
kennedy
proud
to
have
been
able
once
more
to
demonstrate
his
foresight
as
we
left
the
library
entering
the
living
room
there
was
an
appreciable
hush
here
were
grouped
the
others
of
the
party
brought
out
by
the
picture
company
a
constrained
gathering
of
folk
who
had
little
in
common
beyond
the
highly
specialized
needs
of
the
new
art
of
the
screen
an
assembly
of
souls
who
had
been
forced
to
wait
during
all
the
time
required
for
the
trip
of
kennedy
and
myself
out
from
new
york
who
were
compelled
to
wait
now
until
he
should
be
ready
to
examine
them
i
picked
out
the
electrician
in
the
and
with
him
his
fellow
members
of
the
technical
staff
needed
in
the
taking
of
the
scenes
in
the
library
the
camera
men
i
guessed
and
a
property
boy
and
an
assistant
director
the
last
at
any
event
of
all
those
in
the
huge
room
had
summoned
up
sufficient
nonchalance
to
bend
his
mind
to
details
of
his
work
i
saw
that
he
was
thumbing
a
copy
of
the
scenario
or
detailed
working
manuscript
of
the
story
making
notations
in
some
kind
of
little
book
and
it
was
that
which
enabled
me
to
establish
his
identity
at
a
glance
in
a
different
corner
were
the
principals
two
men
and
a
girl
still
in
and
with
them
the
director
and
manton
and
phelps
apart
from
everyone
else
in
a
sort
of
social
ostracism
common
to
the
studios
the
two
extras
waited
a
butler
and
a
maid
also
in
oddly
enough
the
total
number
of
these
material
witnesses
to
the
tragedy
was
just
thirteen
and
i
wondered
if
they
had
noticed
the
fact
doctor
blake
turned
to
kennedy
the
moment
we
left
the
library
do
you
feel
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
remain
any
longer
he
asked
he
was
apologetic
yet
distinctly
impatient
i
have
neglected
several
very
important
calls
as
it
is
kennedy
and
mackay
both
hastened
to
assure
the
physician
that
they
appreciated
his
and
that
they
would
spare
him
as
much
notoriety
and
inconvenience
as
possible
then
the
three
of
us
hurried
across
and
to
the
little
den
which
had
been
converted
into
a
dressing
room
for
stella
use
here
were
all
the
evidences
of
femininity
the
little
touches
which
a
woman
can
impart
to
the
smallest
corner
in
a
few
brief
moments
of
occupancy
it
was
a
tiny
alcove
shut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
living
room
by
heavy
silk
hangings
drawn
now
and
pinned
together
so
as
to
assure
her
the
privacy
she

maximum

traveling
bag
sprawled
wide
open
with
many
of
her
effects
strewn
about
in
attractive
disarray
her
suit
in
which
she
had
made
the
trip
to
tarrytown
was
thrown
carelessly
over
the
back
of
a
chair
her
mirror
was
fastened
up
ruthlessly
upon
a
handsome
woven
oriental
hanging
with
a
long
hatpin
powder
was
spilled
upon
the
couch
cover
another
oriental
fabric
and
her
little
box
of
rouge
lay
face
downward
on
the
floor
as
we
pulled
the
curtains
aside
i
caught
the
perfume
which
still
clung
to
her
clothes
in
the
library
beyond
as
mackay
sniffed
also
kennedy
smiled
coty
jacqueminot
rose
he
remarked
with
his
usual
swift
and
practiced
certainty
kennedy
then
inspected
the
extemporized
dressing
room
he
seemed
to
satisfy
himself
that
no
subtle
attack
had
been
made
upon
the
girl
here
although
i
doubt
that
he
had
held
any
such
supposition
seriously
in
the
first
place
in
my
association
of
several
years
with
kennedy
following
our
first
intimacy
of
college
days
i
had
learned
that
his
success
as
a
scientific
detective
was
the
result
wholly
of
his
thoroughness
of
method
to
watch
him
had
become
a
delight
even
in
the
dull
preliminary
work
of
a
case
as
baffling
as
this
one
mackay
also
seemed
content
just
to
enact
the
role
of
spectator
kennedy
thumbed
through
the
delicate
intimacies
of
her
traveling
bag
with
the
keen
impersonal
manner
which
always
distinguished
him
then
he
found
her
beaded
handbag
and
proceeded
to
rummage
through
that
suddenly
he
paused
as
he
unfolded
a
piece
of
note
paper
and
we
gathered
around
to
read
my
dear
stella
have
something
very
important
to
tell
you
will
you
lunch
tuesday
at
the
tearoom
larry
tuesday
murmured
kennedy
and
this
is
monday
who
who
is
larry
i
wonder
i
hastened
to
answer
the
question
for
him
it
was
my
first
opportunity
to
display
my
knowledge
of
the
picture
players
larry
lawrence
lawrence
millard
i
exclaimed
then
i
went
on
to
tell
him
of
the
divorce
and
the
circumstances
surrounding
stella
life
as
i
knew
it
it
it
looks
i
concluded
as
if
they
might
have
been
on
the
point
of
composing
their
differences
after
all
kennedy
nodded
i
could
see
however
that
he
made
a
mental
note
of
his
intention
to
question
the
girl
former
husband
all
at
once
another
thought
struck
me
and
i
became
eager
it
was
a
possible
explanation
of
the
mystery
listen
craig
i
began
suppose
millard
wanted
to
make
up
and
she
did
suppose
that
she
refused
to
see
him
or
to
meet
him
suppose
that
in
a
jealous
fit
he
no
walter
kennedy
headed
me
off
with
a
smile
this
was
an
ordinary
murder
of
passion
this
was
well
thought
out
and
well
executed
not
one
medical
examiner
in
a
thousand
would
have
found
that
tiny
scratch
it
may
be
very
difficult
yet
to
determine
the
exact
cause
of
death
this
my
dear
jameson
it
was
playful
irony
is
a
scientific
crime
but
millard
of
course
anyone
may
be
the
culprit
yet
you
tell
me
millard
did
not
contest
her
divorce
and
that
it
would
have
been
very
easy
for
him
to
file
a
because
everyone
knew
of
her
relationship
with
manton
that
offhand
shows
no
on
his
part
and
now
we
find
this
note
from
him
which
at
least
is
friendly
in
tone
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
it
was
the
same
blind
alley
in
which
my
thoughts
had
strayed
upon
the
train
on
our
way
out
it
too
early
to
begin
to
try
to
fasten
the
guilt
upon
anyone
kennedy
added
as
we
returned
to
the
library
through
the
living
room
then
he
turned
to
mackay
have
you
succeeded
in
gleaning
any
facts
about
the
life
of
miss
lamar
he
asked
anything
which
might
point
to
a
motive
so
that
i
can
approach
the
case
from
both
directions
if
you
ask
me
the
little
district
attorney
rejoined
it
a
matter
of
tangled
motives
throughout
i
i
had
no
sword
to
cut
the
gordian
knot
and
so
graciously
i
sent
for
you
what
do
you
mean
by
tangled
motives
kennedy
ignored
the
compliment
well
mackay
indicated
me
jameson
explained
about
her
divorce
no
one
heard
whom
she
named
as
corespondent
that
an
unknown
woman
in
the
case
although
it
may
not
mean
anything
at
all
then
there
lloyd
manton
and
all
the
talk
about
his
affair
with
miss
lamar
some
one
told
one
of
my
men
that
manton
wife
has
left
him
on
that
account
did
you
question
manton
no
i
thought
i
ought
to
leave
all
that
to
you
i
was
afraid
i
might
put
them
on
their
guard
good
kennedy
was
pleased
did
you
learn
anything
else
this
deputy
of
mine
obtained
all
these
things
by
gossiping
with
the
girl
who
plays
the
maid
and
so
they
may
not
be
reliable
but
among
the
players
it
is
reported
that
werner
the
director
was
having
an
affair
with
stella
also
and
that
merle
shirley
the
man
was
seen
with
her
a
great
deal
recently
and
that
jack
gordon
the
leading
man
who
was
engaged
to
marry
her
as
soon
as
her
decree
was
final
was
jealous
as
a
consequence
and
that
miss
loring
playing
the
vampire
in
the
story
and
engaged
to
shirley
was
even
more
bitter
against
the
deceased
than
gordon
miss
lamar
fiance
that
made
eight
people
with
possible
motives
for
the
crime
when
i
got
that
far
i
gave
it
up
in
fact
mackay
lowered
his
voice
suddenly
i
do
like
the
attitude
of
emery
phelps
this
is
his
house
you
know
and
he
is
the
financial
backer
of
manton
pictures
yet
there
seems
to
be
an
undercurrent
of
friction
between
manton
and
himself
i
i
wanted
him
to
show
me
some
detail
of
the
arrangement
of
things
in
the
library
but
he
would
come
into
the
room
he
said
he
did
want
to
look
at
miss
lamar
there
there
was
something
and
i
do
know
if
he
is
concerned
in
any
way
that
would
make
nine
you
think
miss
lamar
and
phelps
mackay
shook
his
head
i
do
know
kennedy
turned
to
me
expression
really
serious
is
this
the
way
they
carry
on
in
the
picture
world
walter
he
asked
is
this
the
usual
thing
or
or
an
exception
i
flushed
it
very
much
an
exception
i
insisted
the
film
people
are
just
like
other
people
some
good
and
some
bad
probably
of
all
this
is
gossip
i
hope
so
he
straightened
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
go
after
them
one
at
a
time
and
disentangle
all
the
conflicting
threads
it
looks
as
though
there
will
be
any
number
of
possible
false
leads
and
so
we
must
be
careful
and
deliberate
i
think
i
question
each
in
turn
here
he
walked
over
to
the
fireplace
stopping
for
just
a
moment
to
glance
at
the
body
of
stella
then
he
pulled
the
blinds
down
halfway
so
that
the
room
seemed
somber
and
gruesome
he
drew
a
chair
so
that
the
different
individuals
as
he
examined
them
would
be
unable
to
lose
sight
of
the
dead
woman
his
arrangements
completed
he
faced
the
district
attorney
manton
first
he
directed
in
an
instant
i
caught
the
psychology
of
it
the
now
darkened
library
the
beautiful
body
still
lying
on
the
davenport
the
quiet
and
quick
arrival
of
ourselves
if
anything
could
be
extracted
from
these
people
surely
it
would
be
betrayed
under
these
surroundings
iv
the
fatal
script
i
had
no
real
opportunity
to
study
manton
when
he
greeted
us
upon
our
arrival
and
at
that
time
neither
kennedy
nor
i
possessed
even
a
passing
realization
of
the
problem
before
us
now
i
felt
that
i
was
ready
to
grasp
at
any
possible
motive
for
the
crime
i
was
prepared
to
suspect
any
or
all
of
the
nine
people
enumerated
by
mackay
so
far
as
i
could
speak
for
myself
and
at
the
very
least
i
was
certain
that
this
was
one
of
the
most
baffling
cases
ever
brought
to
craig
attention
yet
i
was
sure
he
would
solve
it
i
waited
most
impatiently
for
the
outcome
of
his
examination
of
lloyd
manton
the
was
a
man
just
approaching
middle
age
about
him
was
a
certain
impression
of
great
physical
strength
of
bulk
without
flabbiness
and
in
particular
i
noticed
the
formation
of
his
head
the
square
broad
development
which
indicated
his
intellectual
power
and
i
found
too
a
fascinating
quality
about
his
eyes
deeply
placed
and
of
a
warm
dark
which
seemed
to
hold
a
fundamental
sincerity
which
i
imagined
made
the
man
almost
irresistible
in
a
business
deal
his
weakness
so
far
as
i
could
ascertain
it
was
revealed
by
his
mouth
and
chin
and
by
a
certain
nervousness
of
his
hands
hands
where
a
square
practical
palm
was
belied
by
the
slight
tapering
of
his
fingers
the
mark
of
the
dreamer
his
mouth
was
unquestionably
sensuous
with
the
lips
full
and
now
and
then
revealing
out
of
the
studied
practiced
calm
of
his
face
an
almost
imperceptible
twitching
as
though
to
betray
a
flash
of
emotion
or
fear
his
chin
was
feminine
softening
his
expression
and
showing
that
his
feelings
would
overbalance
the
cool
calculation
denoted
by
his
eyes
and
the
rather
heavy
level
brows
above
as
he
entered
the
room
taking
the
chair
indicated
by
kennedy
he
seemed
perfectly
cool
and
his
glance
as
it
strayed
to
the
lifeless
form
of
stella
revealed
his
iron
the
little
signs
which
i
have
mentioned
which
betrayed
the
real
man
beneath
were
only
disclosed
to
me
little
by
little
as
kennedy
questioning
progressed
tell
me
just
what
happened
kennedy
began
well
manton
responded
quickly
enough
but
then
he
stopped
and
proceeded
as
though
he
chose
each
word
with
care
as
if
he
framed
each
sentence
so
that
there
would
be
no
misunderstanding
no
chance
of
wrong
impression
all
of
which
pleased
kennedy
in
the
scene
we
were
taking
he
went
on
stella
was
crouched
down
on
the
floor
bending
over
her
father
who
had
just
been
murdered
she
was
sobbing
all
at
once
the
lights
were
to
spring
up
the
young
hero
was
to
dash
through
the
set
and
she
was
to
see
him
and
scream
out
in
terror
the
first
part
went
all
right
but
when
the
lights
flashed
on
instead
of
looking
up
and
screaming
stella
sort
of
crumpled
and
collapsed
on
top
of
werner
who
was
playing
the
father
i
yelled
to
stop
the
cameras
and
rushed
in
we
picked
her
up
and
put
her
on
the
couch
some
one
sent
for
the
doctor
but
she
died
without
saying
a
word
i
i
have
the
slightest
idea
what
happened
at
first
i
thought
it
was
heart
trouble
did
she
have
heart
trouble
no
that
is
not
that
i
ever
heard
kennedy
hesitated
why
were
you
taking
these
scenes
out
here
it
was
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
answer
for
manton
i
knew
that
at
one
time
many
fine
interiors
were
actually
taken
in
houses
to
save
expense
i
was
sorry
that
kennedy
should
draw
any
conclusion
from
a
fact
which
i
thought
was
too
well
known
to
require
explanation
manton
answer
however
proved
a
distinct
surprise
to
me
phelps
asked
us
to
use
his
library
in
this
picture
would
it
have
been
easier
and
cheaper
in
the
long
run
to
reproduce
it
in
the
studio
manton
glanced
up
at
kennedy
echoing
my
thought
had
kennedy
after
all
some
knowledge
of
motion
pictures
stored
away
with
his
vast
fund
of
general
and
unusual
information
yes
replied
the
producer
it
would
save
the
trip
out
here
the
loss
of
time
the
inconvenience
why
in
an
actual
dollars
and
cents
comparison
with
overhead
and
everything
taken
into
account
the
building
of
a
set
like
this
is
nothing
nowadays
do
you
know
phelps
reason
manton
shrugged
his
shoulders
just
a
whim
and
we
had
to
humor
it
phelps
is
interested
in
the
company
yes
he
recently
bought
up
all
the
stock
except
my
own
he
is
in
absolute
control
financially
what
is
the
story
you
are
making
i
mean
i
want
to
understand
just
exactly
what
happened
in
the
scenes
you
were
photographing
today
it
is
essential
that
i
learn
how
everyone
was
supposed
to
act
and
how
they
did
act
i
must
find
out
every
trivial
little
detail
do
you
follow
me
manton
mouth
set
suddenly
showing
that
it
possessed
a
latent
quality
of
firmness
he
glanced
about
the
room
then
rose
went
to
the
farther
end
of
the
long
table
and
returned
with
a
thick
sheaf
of
manuscript
bound
at
the
side
in
stiff
board
covers
this
is
the
scenario
the
script
of
the
detailed
action
he
explained
as
kennedy
took
the
binder
manton
opened
it
and
turned
past
several
sheets
of
tabulation
and
lists
the
index
to
the
sets
and
exterior
locations
the
characters
and
extras
the
changes
of
clothes
and
other
technical
detail
the
scenes
we
are
taking
here
he
went
on
are
the
opening
scenes
of
the
story
we
left
them
until
now
because
it
meant
the
long
trip
out
to
tarrytown
and
because
it
would
take
us
away
from
the
studio
while
they
were
putting
up
the
largest
two
sets
a
banquet
and
a
ballroom
which
need

had
taken
up

you
have
them
in

there
it
it
was
in
the
unlucky
thirteenth
that
she
was
it
my
imagination
or
did
he
tremble
for
just
an
instant
violently
that
she
died

once

what
became
of
the

about
the

neck
in

miss
lamar
is
supposed
to
have
a
peculiar
pendant
at
her
throat
there
was
none
oh
yes
the
promoter
remained
a
moment
in
thought
the
doctor
took
it
off
and
gave
it
to
bernie
the
prop
boy
who
helping
the

is
he
outside
yes
now
try
to
remember
mr
manton
kennedy
leaned
over
very
seriously
just
who
approached
closely
to
miss
lamar
in
the
making
of
that
thirteenth
scene
who
was
near
enough
to
have
inflicted
a
wound
or
to
have
subjected
her
suppose
we
say
to
the
fumes
of
some
subtle
poison
you
think
that
manton
started
to
question
kennedy
but
was
given
no
encouragement
gordon
the
leading
man
passed
through
the
scene
he
replied
after
a
pause
but
did
not
go
very
near
her
werner
was
playing
the
dead
millionaire
at
her
feet
who
is
werner
he
my
director
because
it
was
such
a
small
part
he
played
it
himself
he
only
in
the
two
or
three
scenes
in
the
beginning
and
i
was
here
to
be
at
the
camera
while
kennedy
was
questioning
manton
i
had
been
glancing
through
the
script
of
the
picture
my
own
connection
with
the
movies
had
consisted
largely
of
three
attempts
to
sell
stories
of
my
own
to
the
producers
needless
to
remark
i
had
not
succeeded
in
that
regard
falling
in
the
class
with
some
hundreds
of
thousands
of
my
fellow
citizens
for
everybody
thinks
he
has
at
least
one
motion
picture
in
him
and
so
though
i
had
managed
to
visit
studios
and
meet
a
few
of
the
players
this
was
my
very
first
shot
at
a
manuscript
actually
in
production
i
took
advantage
of
kennedy
momentary
preoccupation
to
turn
to
manton
who
wrote
this
script
mr
manton
i
asked
millard
lawrence
millard
millard
kennedy
and
i
exclaimed
simultaneously
why
yes
millard
is
still
under
contract
and
he
the
only
man
who
ever
could
write
scripts
for
stella
we
we
tried
others
and
they
all
flivved
is
millard
here
manton
burst
into
laughter
somehow
out
of
place
in
the
room
where
we
still
were
in
the
company
of
death
an
author
on
the
lot
at
the
filming
of
his
picture
to
bother
the
director
and
to
change
everything
out
when
the
scenario
done
he
through
he
lucky
to
get
his
name
on
the
screen
it
not
the
story
but
the
direction
which
counts
except
that
you
got
to
have
a
good
idea
to
start
with
and
a
halfway
decent
script
to
make
your
from
anyhow
he
sobered
a
bit
perhaps
realizing
that
he
was
going
counter
to
the
tendency
to
have
the
author
on
the
lot
millard
and
stella
were
on
speaking
terms
she
divorced
him
you
know
do
you
know
much
about
the
personal
affairs
of
miss
lamar
well
manton
eyes
sought
the
floor
for
a
moment
like
everyone
else
in
pictures
stella
was
the
victim
of
a
great
deal
of
gossip
that
the
experience
of
any
girl
who
rises
to
a
position
of
prominence
and
how
were
the
relations
between
miss
lamar
and
yourself
interrupted
kennedy
what
do
you
mean
by
that
manton
flushed
quickly
you
have
had
no
trouble
no
disagreements
recently
no
indeed
everything
has
been
very
friendly
between
us
in
a
strictly
business
way
of
course
and
i
do
believe
i
had
an
unpleasant
word
with
her
since
i
first
formed
manton
pictures
to
make
her
a
star
you
know
nothing
of
her
difficulties
with
her
husband
naturally
not
i
seldom
saw
her
except
at
the
studio
unless
it
was
some
necessary
affair
such
as
a
screen
ball
here
or
perhaps
in
boston
or
philadelphia
or
some
city
where
i
would
take
her
for
effect
kennedy
turned
to
mackay
will
you
arrange
to
keep
the
people
i
have
yet
to
question
separate
from
the
ones
i
have
examined
already
as
the
district
attorney
nodded
kennedy
dismissed
manton
rather
shortly
then
turned
again
to
mackay
as
the
promoter
drew
out
of
earshot
bring
in
bernie
the
before
anyone
can
tell
him
to
hide
or
destroy
that
locket
v
an
emotional
maze
bernie
proved
to
be
as
stupid
a
youth
as
any
i
had
ever
seen
he
possessed
frightened
eyes
and
overshot
ears
and
hair
which
might
have
been
red
beneath
its
accumulation
of
dust
without
doubt
the
boy
had
been
coached
by
the
electrician
because
he
began
to
affirm
his
innocence
in
similar
fashion
the
moment
he
entered
the
door
i
do
know
nothin
honest
i
do
he
pleaded
i
was
out
in
the
hall
i
was
and
i
did
come
in
at
all
until
the
doc
came
i
suppose
you
were
anxious
to
see
if
the
cable
was
becoming
hot
kennedy
suggested
gravely
that
it
sir
we
was
lookin
at
it
because
it
was
on
the
varnish
and
the
butler
he
says
where
the
locket
interrupted
kennedy
the
one
miss
lamar
wore
in
the
scenes
oh
in
disdain
that
thing
with
some
effort
bernie
fished
it
from
the
capacious
depths
of
a
pocket
disentangling
the
sharp
corners
from
the
torn
and
ragged
lining
of
his
coat
i
glanced
at
it
as
kennedy
turned
it
over
and
over
in
his
hands
and
saw
that
it
was
a
palpable
stage
prop
with
glass
jewels
of
the
cheapest
sort
concealing
his
disappointment
kennedy
dropped
it
into
his
own
pocket
confronting
the
frightened
bernie
once
more
do
you
know
anything
about
miss
lamar
death
no
i
do
know
nothing
honest
all
right
kennedy
turned
to
mackay
werner
the
director
of
stanley
werner
i
had
heard
a
great
deal
through
interviews
character
studies
and
other
press
stuff
in
the
photoplay
journals
and
the
sunday
newspaper
film
sections
now
i
found
him
to
be
a
individual
so
extremely
nervous
that
it
seemed
impossible
for
him
to
remain
in
one
position
in
his
chair
or
for
him
to
keep
his
hands
motionless
for
a
single
instant
although
he
was
of
moderate
build
with
a
fair
suggestion
of
flesh
there
were
yet
the
marks
of
the
artist
and
of
the
creative
temperament
in
the
fine
sloping
contours
of
his
head
and
in
his
remarkably
long
fingers
which
tapered
to
nails
manicured
immaculately
kennedy
seemed
to
pay
particular
attention
to
his
eyes
which
were
dark
soft
and
amazingly
restless
who
was
in
the
cast
werner
what
were
they
playing
and
just
exactly
what
was
each
doing
at
the
time
of
miss
lamar
collapse
well
werner
eyes
shifted
to
mine
then
to
mackay
and
there
was
a
subtle
lack
of
ease
in
his
manner
which
i
was
hardly
prepared
to
classify
as
yet
stella
lamar
was
playing
the
part
of
stella
remsen
the
heroine
and
uh
i
see
your
associate
has
the
script
he
paused
glancing
at
me
again
when
kennedy
said
nothing
werner
went
on
growing
more
and
more
nervous
jack
gordon
plays
jack
daring
the
hero
the
handsome
young
chap
who
runs
down
the
steps
and
encounters
the
butler
and
the
maid
in
the
hall
just
outside
the
library
was
it
his
face
in
the
french
windows
of
the
library
at
the
same
time
kennedy
asked
was
he
the
murderer
of
the
father
also
no
werner
smiled
slightly
and
there
was
an
instant
flash
of
the
man
personality
winning
and
it
seemed
to
me
calculated
to
inspire
confidence
that
is
the
mystery
it
is
a
mystery
plot
while
the
parts
are
played
by
jack
in
both
cases
now
we
explain
in
a
subtitle
a
little
later
that
the
criminal
himself
the
terror
is
a
master
of
scientific
impersonation
and
that
he
changes
the
faces
of
his
emissaries
by
means
of
plastic
surgery
and
such
scientific
things
so
that
they
look
like
the
characters
against
whom
he
wishes
to
throw
suspicion
so
while
jack
plays
the
part
it
is
really
an
accomplice
of
the
terror
who
kills
old
remsen
kennedy
turned
to
me
a
new
idea
in
the
application
of
science
to
crime
he
remarked
dryly
just
suppose
it
were
practicable
the
terror
werner
continued
is
played
by
merle
shirley
you
heard
of
him
the
greatest
villain
ever
known
to
the
films
then
there
marilyn
loring
the
vampire
another
good
trouper
too
she
plays
zelda
old
remsen
ward
and
it
a
question
whether
zelda
or
stella
will
be
the
remsen
heir
marilyn
herself
is
an
awfully
nice
girl
but
oh
how
the
fans
hate
her
the
director
chuckled
no
millard
story
is
ever
complete
without
a
vamp
and
marilyn
been
eating
them
up
she
been
with
manton
pictures
for
nearly
a
year
you
played
the
millionaire
yourself
yes
i
did
old
remsen
i
realized
suddenly
for
the
first
time
that
werner
was
still
in
the
evening
clothes
he
had
donned
for
the
part
on
his
face
were
streaks
in
the
little
that
remained
after
his
frequent
mopping
of
his
features
with
his
handkerchief
too
his
collar
was
melted
i
could
imagine
his
discomfort
did
you
have
any
business
with
stella
kennedy
asked
using
the
stage
term
for
the
minor
bits
of
action
in
the
playing
of
a
scene
did
you
move
at
all
while
she
was
going
through
her
part
no
kennedy
i
was
man
in
all
the
scenes
show
me
how
you
lay
if
you
will
obligingly
werner
stretched
out
on
the
carpet
duplicating
his
positions
even
to
the
exact
manner
in
which
he
had
placed
his
hands
and
arms
rather
to
my
own
distaste
kennedy
impressed
me
to
represent
i
am
sure
in
clumsy
fashion
the
various
positions
of
stella
lamar
most
painstakingly
kennedy
worked
back
from
the
thirteenth
scene
to
the
first
referring
to
the
script
and
coaxing
details
of
memory
from
the
mind
of
werner
i
grasped
kennedy
purpose
almost
at
once
he
was
endeavoring
to
reproduce
the
action
which
had
been
photographed
so
as
to
determine
just
how
the
poison
had
been
administered
of
course
he
made
no
reference
to
the
tiny
scratch
and
mackay
and
i
were
careful
to
give
no
hint
of
it
to
werner
the
director
however
seemed
most
willing
to
assist
us
i
certainly
felt
no
suspicion
of
him
now
as
for
kennedy
his
face
was
unrevealing
when
the
film
in
the
camera
is
developed
i
suggested
to
kennedy
suddenly
he
silenced
me
with
a
gesture
i
have
overlooked
that
but
the
scenes
will
be
from
one
angle
only
and
in
a
darkened
set
i
can
determine
more
this
way
somewhat
crestfallen
i
continued
my
impersonation
of
the
slain
star
not
altogether
willingly
soon
kennedy
had
completed
his
reconstruction
of
the
action
who
else
entered
the
scene
besides
gordon
he
asked
the
butler
and
the
maid
after
the
lights
were
flashed
on
i
question
the
camera
men
he
announced
who
are
they
harry
watkins
is
the
head
photographer
werner
explained
he
a
crackerjack
too
one
of
the
best
lighting
experts
in
the
country
al
penny
grinding
the
other
box
let
have
watkins
first
kennedy
nodded
to
mackay
to
escort
the
director
from
the
room
neither
watkins
nor
penny
were
able
to
add
anything
to
the
facts
which
kennedy
had
gleaned
from
manton
and
werner
when
he
had
finished
his
patient
examination
of
the
junior
camera
man
he
recalled
watkins
and
had
both
under
his
eyes
close
and
seal
the
film
cartridges
which
contained
the
photographic
record
of
the
thirteen
scenes
dismissing
the
men
he
handed
the
two
black
boxes
to
mackay
can
you
arrange
to
have
these
developed
and
printed
quickly
but
in
some
way
so
neither
negative
nor
positive
will
be
out
of
your
sight
at
any
time
mackay
nodded
i
know
the
owner
of
a
laboratory
in
yonkers
good
now
let
have
the
leading
man
jack
gordon
immediately
impressed
me
very
unfavorably
there
was
something
about
him
for
which
i
could
find
no
word
but
sleek
learning
much
from
my
long
association
with
kennedy
i
observed
at
once
that
he
had
removed
the
from
his
face
and
that
he
had
on
a
clean
white
collar
since
the
linen
worn
before
the
camera
is
dyed
a
faint
tint
to
prevent
the
halation
caused
by
pure
white
it
was
a
sure
sign
to
me
that
he
had
spruced
up
a
bit
i
knew
that
he
was
engaged
to
stella
here
in
this
room
she
lay
dead
under
the
most
mysterious
circumstances
there
was
little
question
in
fact
that
she
had
been
murdered
how
could
he
really
loving
her
think
of
such
things
as
the
left
on
his
face
or
his
clothes
i
had
to
admit
that
he
was
a
handsome
individual
perhaps
slightly
less
than
average
in
height
and
very
slender
he
had
the
build
of
an
athlete
the
contour
of
his
head
and
the
perfect
regularity
of
rather
large
features
made
him
an
ideal
type
for
the
screen
at
any
angle
in
and
foregrounds
as
well
as
full
shots
in
actual
life
there
were
little
things
covered
by
in
his
work
such
as
the
cold
gray
tint
of
his
eyes
and
the
lines
of
dissipation
about
his
mouth
kennedy
questioned
him
first
about
his
movements
in
the
different
scenes
then
asked
him
if
he
had
seen
or
noticed
anything
suspicious
during
the
taking
of
any
of
them
or
in
the
intervals
between
i
had
several
changes
kennedy
he
replied
part
of
the
time
i
was
jack
daring
my
regular
role
but
i
was
also
the
emissary
who
looked
like
daring
i
went
out
each
time
because
i
make
up
the
emissary
to
look
hard
werner
wanted
to
fool
the
people
a
little
bit
but
he
did
want
them
to
be
positive
the
emissary
was
daring
as
would
happen
if
both
were
the
same
did
you
have
any
opportunity
to
talk
to
miss
lamar
none
at
all
werner
was
pushing
us
to
the
limit
did
she
seem
her
usual
self
at
the
start
of
the
scene
no
she
seemed
a
little
out
of
sorts
but
gordon
hesitated
something
had
been
troubling
her
all
day
she
hardly
would
talk
to
me
in
the
car
on
the
way
out
at
all
it
did
strike
me
that
she
acted
any
different
when
she
went
in
to
take
the
scene
you
were
engaged
to
her
yes
gordon
eyes
caught
the
body
on
the
davenport
before
him
he
glanced
away
hastily
taking
his
lower
lip
between
his
teeth
had
you
been
having
any
trouble
no
that
is
nothing
to
amount
to
anything
but
you
had
a
quarrel
or
a
misunderstanding
his
face
flushed
slowly
she
was
to
obtain
her
final
decree
early
next
week
i
wanted
her
to
marry
me
then
at
once
she
refused
when
i
reproached
her
for
not
considering
my
wishes
she
pretended
to
be
cool
and
began
an
elaborate
flirtation
with
merle
shirley
you
say
she
only
pretended
to
be
cool
for
a
few
moments
gordon
hesitated
then
apparently
his
vanity
loosened
his
tongue
he
wished
it
to
be
understood
that
he
had
held
the
love
of
stella
to
the
last
last
night
he
volunteered
we
made
everything
up
and
she
was
as
affectionate
as
she
ever
had
been
this
morning
she
was
cool
but
i
could
tell
it
was
pretense
and
so
i
let
her
alone
there
has
been
no
real
trouble
between
you
the
leading
man
met
kennedy
gaze
squarely
not
a
bit
kennedy
turned
to
mackay
shirley
he
ordered
by
a
miscalculation
on
the
part
of
the
little
district
attorney
the
heavy
man
entered
the
room
a
moment
before
gordon
left
they
came
face
to
face
just
within
the
portieres
there
was
no
mistaking
the
hostility
the
open
hate
between
the
two
men
both
kennedy
and
i
caught
the
glances
then
merle
shirley
approached
the
fireplace
taking
the
chair
indicated
by
kennedy
i
was
in
any
of
the
opening
scenes
he
explained
i
remained
out
in
the
car
until
i
got
wind
of
the
excitement
by
that
time
stella
was
dead
do
you
know
anything
of
a
quarrel
between
miss
lamar
and
gordon
shirley
rose
clenching
his
fists
for
several
moments
he
stood
gazing
down
at
the
star
with
an
expression
on
his
face
which
i
could
not
analyze
the
pause
gave
me
an
opportunity
to
study
him
however
and
i
noticed
that
while
he
had
heavier
features
than
gordon
and
was
a
larger
man
in
every
way
ideally
endowed
for
heavy
parts
there
was
yet
a
certain
boyish
freshness
clinging
to
him
in
subtle
fashion
he
wore
his
clothes
in
a
loose
sort
of
way
which
suggested
the
west
and
the
open
in
contrast
to
gordon
metropolitan
sophistication
and
immaculate
tailoring
he
was
every
inch
the
man
and
a
splendid
actor
i
knew
yet
there
was
the
touch
of
youth
about
him
he
seemed
incapable
of
a
crime
such
as
this
unless
it
was
in
anger
or
as
the
result
of
some
hidden
passion
now
whether
he
was
angry
or
in
the
clutch
of
a
broad
disgust
i
could
not
tell
perhaps
it
was
both
very
suddenly
he
wheeled
upon
kennedy
his
voice
became
low
and
vibrant
with
feeling
here
was
none
of
the
steeled
of
manton
the
deceptive
outer
mask
which
werner
used
to
cover
his
thoughts
the
nonchalant
cold
frankness
of
gordon
kennedy
the
actor
exclaimed
i
been
a
fool
a
fool
how
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
i
allowed
stella
to
flatter
my
vanity
and
lead
me
into
a
flirtation
which
meant
nothing
at
all
to
her
god
you
are
responsible
for
the
trouble
between
miss
lamar
and
gordon
then
never
shirley
indicated
the
body
of
the
star
with
a
quick
passionate
sweep
of
his
hand
now
i
could
not
tell
whether
he
was
acting
or
in
earnest
she
responsible
he
exclaimed
responsible
for
everything
her
death
no
shirley
sobered
suddenly
as
if
he
had
forgotten
the
mystery
altogether
i
do
know
anything
at
all
about
that
nor
have
i
any
idea
unless
but
he
checked
himself
rather
than
voice
an
empty
suspicion
just
what
do
you
mean
then
kennedy
was
sharp
impatient
she
made
a
fool
of
me
and
and
i
was
engaged
to
marilyn
loring
were
engaged
the
engagement
marilyn
broke
it
off
last
night
and
would
listen
to
me
even
though
i
came
to
my
senses
and
saw
what
a
fool
i
had
been
was
kennedy
framed
his
question
carefully
was
your
infatuation
for
miss
lamar
of
long
duration
just
a
few
weeks
i
i
took
her
out
to
dinner
and
to
the
theater
and
and
that
was
all
i
see
kennedy
walked
away
nodding
to
mackay
will
you
have
miss
loring
next
asked
the
district
attorney
kennedy
nodded
marilyn
loring
was
a
surprise
to
me
stella
lamar
both
on
the
screen
and
in
real
life
was
a
beauty
in
the
films
marilyn
was
a
beauty
also
apparently
of
a
cold
unfeeling
type
but
in
the
flesh
she
was
disclosed
as
a
person
utterly
different
from
all
my
preconceived
notions
in
the
first
place
she
was
not
particularly
attractive
except
when
she
smiled
her
coloring
hair
frankly
and
naturally
red
skin
slightly
mottled
and
pale
produced
in
photography
the
black
hair
and
marble
white
skin
which
distinguished
her
but
as
i
studied
her
as
she
was
now
before
she
had
put
on
any
and
while
she
was
still
dressed
in
a
simple
summer
gown
of
organdie
she
looked
as
though
she
might
have
stepped
into
the
room
from
the
main
street
of
some
town
in
repose
she
was
shy
diffident
in
appearance
when
she
smiled
naturally
without
holding
the
hard
lines
of
her
vampire
roles
there
was
the
slight
suggestion
of
a
dimple
and
she
was
essentially
girlish
when
a
trace
of
emotion
or
feeling
came
into
her
face
the
woman
was
evident
she
might
have
been
seventeen
or
to
my
surprise
kennedy
made
no
effort
to
elicit
further
information
concerning
the
personal
animosities
of
these
people
perhaps
he
felt
it
too
much
of
an
emotional
maze
to
be
straightened
out
in
this
preliminary
investigation
when
he
found
marilyn
had
watched
the
taking
of
the
scenes
he
compared
her
account
with
those
which
he
had
already
obtained
then
he
dismissed
her
in
rapid
succession
for
he
was
impatient
now
to
follow
up
other
methods
of
investigation
he
called
in
and
examined
the
remaining
possible
witnesses
of
the
tragedy
these
were
the
two
extra
players
the
butler
and
the
maid
the
assistant
director
house
servants
and
emery
phelps
himself
for
some
unknown
reason
he
left
the
owner
of
the
house
to
the
very
last
why
did
you
wish
these
scenes
photographed
out
here
he
asked
because
i
wanted
to
see
my
library
in
pictures
were
you
watching
the
taking
of
the
scenes
yes
will
you
describe
just
what
happened
phelps
flushed
he
was
irritated
and
in
no
mood
to
humor
us
any
more
than
necessary
a
man
of
perhaps
forty
with
the
portly
flabbiness
which
often
accompanies
success
in
the
financial
markets
he
was
accustomed
to
obtaining
rather
than
yielding
obedience
a
bachelor
he
had
built
this
house
as
a
show
place
merely
according
to
the
gossip
among
newspaper
men
seldom
living
in
it
have
about
a
dozen
people
described
it
for
you
already
he
asked
distinctly
petulant
kennedy
smiled
did
you
notice
anything
particularly
out
of
the
way
anything
which
might
be
a
clue
to
the
manner
in
which
miss
lamar
met
her
death
phelps
attitude
became
frankly
malicious
if
i
had
or
if
any
of
us
had
we
would
have
found
it
necessary
to
send
for
craig
kennedy
or
turning
to
me
the
representative
of
the
new
york
star
kennedy
undisturbed
walked
to
the
side
of
mackay
i
leave
phelps
and
his
house
in
your
care
he
remarked
in
a
low
voice
mackay
grinned
i
saw
that
the
district
attorney
had
little
love
for
the
owner
of
this
particular
estate
in
tarrytown
kennedy
led
the
way
into
the
living
room
immediately
the
various
people
he
had
questioned
clustered
up
with
varying
degrees
of
anxiety
had
the
mystery
been
solved
he
gave
them
no
satisfaction
but
singled
out
manton
who
seemed
eager
to
get
away
where
is
millard
i
would
like
to
talk
to
him
i
try
to
get
him
for
you
suppose
manton
looked
at
his
watch
i
should
be
in
at
the
studio
he
explained
everything
is
at
a
standstill
probably
and
and
so
suppose
you
and
jameson
ride
in
with
me
in
my
car
millard
might
be
there
kennedy
brightened
good
then
he
looked
back
to
catch
the
eye
of
mackay
let
everyone
go
now
he
directed
do
forget
to
send
me
the
samples
of
the
body
fluids
and
as
an
afterthought
you
better
keep
a
watch
on
the
house
vi
the
first
clue
manton
car
was
a
expensive
limousine
fitted
inside
with
every
luxury
of
which
the
mind
of
even
a
prima
donna
could
conceive
painted
a
vivid
yellow
that
must
have
made
it
an
object
of
attention
even
on
its
familiar
routes
it
was
quite
characteristic
of
its
owner
for
manton
as
we
learned
missed
no
chance
to
advertise
himself
in
the
back
with
us
was
werner
while
the
rest
of
the
company
were
left
to
return
to
the
city
in
the
two
studio
cars
which
had
brought
them
out
in
the
morning
the
director
however
seemed
buried
with
his
reflections
he
took
no
part
in
the
conversation
paid
no
attention
to
us
upon
the
entire
trip
manton
mind
seemed
to
dwell
rather
upon
the
problems
brought
up
by
the
death
of
stella
than
upon
the
tragedy
itself
the
star
photoplay
editor
once
had
remarked
to
me
that
the
promoter
was
per
cent
bull
and
per
cent
efficiency
i
found
that
it
was
an
unfair
estimation
with
all
his
and
almost
obnoxious
personality
manton
was
a
more
than
capable
executive
in
a
business
where
efficiency
and
method
are
rare
this
has
been
a
hoodoo
picture
from
the
start
he
exclaimed
suddenly
we
have
been
jinxed
with
a
vengeance
some
one
has
held
the
indian
sign
on
us
for
sure
kennedy
i
noticed
listened
studying
the
man
cautiously
from
the
corners
of
his
eyes
but
making
no
effort
to
draw
him
out
first
there
were
changes
to
be
made
in
the
script
and
for
those
millard
took
his
own
sweet
time
then
we
were
handed
a
lot
of
negative
which
had
been
fogged
in
the
perforator
a
thing
that
does
happen
once
in
a
thousand
years
but
it
caught
us
just
as
we
sent
the
company
down
to
delaware
water
gap
a
whole
ten
days
work
went
into
the
developer
at
once
neither
of
the
camera
men
caught
the
fog
in
their
tests
because
it
came
in
the
middle
of
the
rolls
everything
had
to
be
done
over
again
and
accidents
we
carefully
registered
the
principal
accomplice
of
the
terror
a
little
hunchback
with
a
face
to
send
chills
down
your
back
after
we
had
him
in
about
half
the
scenes
of
a
sequence
of
action
he
was
taken
sick
and
died
of
influenza
first
we
waited
a
few
days
then
we
had
to
take
all
that
stuff
over
again
our
payroll
on
this
picture
is
staggering
stella
three
thousand
a
week
is
cheap
for
her
the
old
contract
but
it
a
lot
of
money
to
throw
away
two
weeks
when
she
was
under
the
weather
cost
us
six
thousand
dollars
salary
and
there
was
half
a
week
we
could
do
any
work
without
her
gordon
and
shirley
and
marilyn
loring
draw
down
seventeen
hundred
a
week
between
them
the
director
salary
is
only
two
hundred
short
of
that
all
told
black
terror
is
costing
us
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
over
our
original
estimate
and
now
it
seemed
to
me
that
manton
literally
groaned
with
stella
lamar
dead
excuse
me
looking
at
it
this
way
but
after
all
it
is
business
and
i
the
executive
at
the
head
of
the
company
now
we
must
find
a
new
star
lord
knows
where
and
we
must
retake
every
scene
in
which
stella
appeared
it
it
enough
to
bankrupt
manton
pictures
for
once
and
all
ca
you
change
the
story
about
some
way
so
you
wo
lose
the
value
of
her
work
asked
kennedy
impossible
we
announced
the
release
and
we
got
to
go
ahead
fortunately
some
of
the
biggest
sets
are
not
taken
yet
the
car
pulled
up
with
a
flourish
before
the
manton
studio
which
was
an
immense
affair
of
reinforced
concrete
in
the
upper
bronx
then
in
response
to
our
horn
a
great
wide
double
door
swung
open
admitting
us
through
the
building
to
a
large
courtyard
around
which
the
various
departments
were
built
here
there
was
little
indication
that
the
principal
star
of
the
company
had
just
met
her
death
under
mysterious
and
suspicious
circumstances
perhaps
had
i
been
familiar
with
the
ordinary
bustle
of
the
establishment
i
might
have
detected
a
difference
indeed
it
did
strike
me
that
there
were
little
knots
of
people
here
and
there
discussing
the
tragedy
but
everything
was
overshadowed
by
the
aquatic
scene
being
filmed
in
the
courtyard
for
some
other
manton
picture
the
cramped
space
about
the
concrete
tank
was
alive
with
people
a
mob
of
extras
and
stage
hands
and
various
employees
a
sight
which
held
kennedy
and
me
for
some
little
time
i
was
glad
when
manton
led
the
way
through
a
long
hall
to
the
comparative
quiet
of
the
office
building
in
the
reception
room
there
was
a
decided
hush
is
millard
here
he
asked
of
the
boy
seated
at
the
information
desk
no
sir
was
the
respectful
reply
he
was
here
this
morning
and
for
a
while
yesterday
you
see
manton
confronted
kennedy
grimly
this
is
only
one
of
the
things
with
which
we
have
to
contend
in
this
business
i
give
millard
an
office
but
he
a
law
unto
himself
it
the
artistic
temperament
if
i
interfere
then
he
says
he
can
not
write
and
he
does
produce
any
manuscript
ordinarily
he
can
not
be
bothered
to
work
at
the
studio
but
philosophically
i
know
where
to
get
him
as
a
general
thing
he
does
most
of
his
writing
in
his
rooms
downtown
says
there
more
inspiration
in
the
confusion
of
broadway
than
in
the
wilds
of
the
bronx
i
phone
him
we
followed
the
promoter
up
the
stairs
to
the
second
and
top
floor
here
a
corridor
gave
access
to
the
various
executive
offices
its
windows
at
frequent
intervals
looked
down
upon
the
courtyard
and
the
present
confusion
werner
who
had
preceded
us
into
the
building
now
came
up
as
manton
bustled
into
his
own
office
to
use
the
telephone
the
director
turned
to
kennedy
indicating
the
next
doorway
this
is
my
place
he
explained
it
connects
with
manton
on
one
side
through
his
reception
room
you
see
in
addition
to
directing
stella
lamar
i
have
been
in
general
charge
of
production
and
most
of
the
casting
is
up
to
me
kennedy
entered
after
werner
interested
and
i
followed
the
door
through
to
the
reception
room
stood
open
and
beyond
was
the
one
to
manton
quarters
i
could
see
the
promoter
at
his
desk
receiver
at
his
ear
an
impatient
expression
upon
his
face
in
the
reception
room
a
rather
pretty
girl
young
and
of
a
type
i
thought
was
busy
at
a
clattering
typewriter
she
rose
and
closed
the
door
upon
manton
so
as
not
to
disturb
him
the
next
office
on
this
side
is
millard
volunteered
werner
the
only
scenario
writer
dignified
with
quarters
in
this
building
manton
has
other
writers
has
he
kennedy
asked
yes
the
scenario
department
is
on
the
third
floor
across
the
court
above
the
laboratory
and
cutting
rooms
who
else
is
in
the
building
here
there
are
six
rooms
on
this
floor
werner
replied
manton
the
waiting
room
myself
millard
and
the
two
other
directors
below
is
the
general
reception
room
the
cashier
the
bookkeepers
and
stenographers
as
manton
probably
was
having
trouble
obtaining
his
connection
and
as
kennedy
continued
to
question
werner
concerning
the
general
arrangement
of
the
different
floors
in
the
different
buildings
about
the
quadrangle
all
uninteresting
to
me
i
determined
to
look
about
a
bit
on
my
own
hook
i
was
still
anxious
to
be
of
genuine
assistance
to
kennedy
for
once
through
my
greater
knowledge
of
the
film
world
strolling
out
into
the
corridor
i
went
to
the
door
of
millard
room
to
my
disappointment
it
was
locked
continuing
down
the
hall
i
stole
a
glance
into
each
of
the
two
directors
quarters
but
saw
nothing
to
awaken
my
suspicion
or
justify
my
intrusion
beyond
i
discovered
a
washroom
and
aware
suddenly
of
the
immense
amount
of
dust
i
had
acquired
in
the
ride
in
from
tarrytown
i
entered
to
freshen
my
hands
and
face
at
the
least
it
was
a
stroke
of
luck
a
fortunate
impulse
the
amount
of
money
to
be
made
in
the
movies
had
resulted
in
the
case
of
manton
in
luxurious
equipment
for
all
the
various
departments
of
his
establishment
i
had
noticed
the
offices
furnished
with
a
richness
worthy
of
a
bank
or
some
great
downtown
institution
now
in
the
lavatory
immaculate
with
its
white
tile
and
modern
appointments
i
saw
a
shelf
literally
stacked
in
this
day
of
paper
with
linen
towels
of
the
finest
quality
as
i
drew
the
water
hot
instantly
my
eye
caught
half
in
and
half
out
of
the
wire
basket
beneath
the
stand
one
of
the
towels
covered
with
peculiar
yellow
spots
immediately
my
suspicions
were
awakened
i
picked
it
up
gingerly
at
close
range
i
saw
that
the
spots
were
only
chrome
yellow
but
there
were
also
spots
of
a
different
nature
i
did
not
stop
to
think
of
the
unlikeliness
of
the
discovery
of
a
real
clue
under
these
circumstances
analyzed
afterward
by
kennedy
i
folded
the
towel
hastily
and
hurried
to
rejoin
him
to
show
it
to
him
i
found
him
with
werner
waiting
for
the
results
of
manton
efforts
to
locate
millard
almost
at
the
moment
i
rejoined
the
two
a
boy
came
to
summon
werner
to
one
of
the
sets
out
on
the
stage
itself
kennedy
and
i
were
alone
i
showed
him
the
towel
at
first
he
laughed
you
never
make
a
detective
walter
he
remarked
this
is
only
simple
coloring
yellow
to
be
exact
and
will
you
tell
me
too
he
became
ironical
how
do
you
expect
to
find
clues
of
this
sort
here
for
a
murder
committed
in
tarrytown
when
all
the
people
present
were
held
out
there
and
examined
when
we
are
the
first
to
arrive
back
here
yellow
you
know
photographs
white
chinese
yellow
is
used
largely
in
studios
in
place
of
white
in
because
it
does
not
cause
halation
which
to
the
picture
people
is
the
bane
of
their
existence
white
is
too
glaring
reflects
rays
that
blur
the
photography
sometimes
if
you
will
notice
the
next
time
you
see
them
shooting
a
scene
you
will
find
the
actors
faces
tinged
with
yellow
even
tablecloths
and
napkins
and
dresses
are
frequently
colored
a
pale
yellow
although
pale
blue
has
the
actinic
qualities
of
white
for
this
purpose
and
is
now
perhaps
more
frequently
used
than
yellow
i
was
properly
chastened
in
fact
though
i
did
not
say
much
i
almost
determined
to
let
him
conduct
his
case
himself
kennedy
saw
my
crestfallen
expression
and
understood
he
was
about
to
say
something
encouraging
as
he
handed
back
the
towel
when
his
eye
fell
on
the
other
end
of
it
which
indeed
i
myself
had
noticed
he
sobered
instantly
and
studied
the
other
spots
indeed
i
had
not
examined
them
closely
myself
they
were
the
very
faint
stains
of
some
other
yellow
substance
a
liquid
which
had
dried
and
did
not
rub
off
as
the
and
there
were
also
some
small
round
drops
of
dark
red
almost
hidden
in
the
fancy
red
scrollwork
of
the
lettering
on
the
towel
manton
pictures
the
latter
had
escaped
me
altogether
blood
kennedy
exclaimed
then
look
here
the
marks
of
the
pale
yellow
liquid
trailed
into
a
slender
trace
of
blood
it
looks
as
if
some
one
had
cleaned
a
needle
on
it
he
muttered
and
in
a
hurry
i
remembered
his
previous
remark
the
murder
had
been
in
tarrytown
we
had
just
arrived
here
would
anyone
have
time
to
do
it
i
asked
whoever
used
the
towel
did
so
in
a
hurry
he
reiterated
seriously
it
may
have
been
some
one
afraid
to
leave
any
sort
of
clue
out
there
at
phelps
house
there
were
too
many
watchers
about
it
might
have
seemed
better
to
have
run
the
risk
of
a
search
with
no
sign
of
a
wound
on
miss
lamar
person
it
was
pretty
certain
that
neither
mackay
nor
i
would
attempt
to
frisk
everyone
it
was
not
as
though
we
were
looking
for
a
revolver
if
she
were
shot
or
a
knife
if
she
had
been
stabbed
and
he
could
not
resist
another
dig
at
me
and
that
we
should
look
in
a
washroom
here
for
a
towel
was
well
an
idea
that
would
occur
to
anyone
but
the
most
amateur
and
blundering
sort
of
sleuth
beginner
luck
walter
beginner
luck
i
ignored
the
uncomplimentary
part
of
his
remarks
who
could
have
been
in
the
washroom
just
before
me
i
asked
suddenly
he
hurried
through
the
waiting
room
to
the
door
to
office
opening
it
without
ceremony
manton
was
gone
we
exchanged
glances
i
remembered
that
werner
had
preceded
us
upstairs
it
means
werner
or
manton
himself
i
whispered
so
the
girl
just
behind
us
would
not
hear
kennedy
strode
out
to
the
hall
and
to
a
window
overlooking
the
court
after
a
moment
he
pointed
i
recognized
both
the
cars
used
to
transport
the
company
to
the
home
of
emery
phelps
there
was
no
sign
that
either
had
just
arrived
for
even
the
chauffeurs
were
out
of
sight
perhaps
melted
into
the
crowd
about
the
tank
in
the
corner
they
must
have
arrived
immediately
behind
us
kennedy
remarked
we
wasted
several
valuable
minutes
looking
at
that
water
stuff
ourselves
at
that
moment
werner
voice
rose
from
the
reception
room
below
it
was
probable
that
he
would
be
up
to
rejoin
us
again
i
remembered
that
he
had
not
been
at
all
at
ease
while
kennedy
questioned
him
in
tarrytown
that
here
at
the
studio
he
had
been
palpably
anxious
to
remain
close
at
our
heels
i
felt
a
surge
of
suspicion
within
me
listen
craig
i
muttered
in
low
tones
manton
had
no
opportunity
to
steal
down
the
hall
after
the
girl
closed
the
door
and
why
not
he
interrupted
contradicting
me
we
had
our
backs
to
the
door
while
we
were
talking
with
werner
well
anyhow
it
narrows
down
to
manton
and
werner
because
that
is
the
washroom
for
these
offices
kennedy
stopped
me
as
werner
mounted
the
stairs
he
turned
to
the
director
with
assumed
nonchalance
how
long
have
the
other
cars
been
here
he
asked
i
thought
we
came
pretty
fast
werner
smiled
i
guess
those
boys
had
enough
of
tarrytown
they
rolled
into
the
yard
both
of
them
while
you
and
jameson
and
manton
were
stopping
to
watch
the
people
in
the
water
i
see
kennedy
gave
me
a
side
glance
where
are
the
dressing
rooms
he
inquired
it
was
a
random
shot
werner
pointed
to
the
end
of
the
hall
toward
the
washroom
in
the
next
building
on
this
floor
that
is
the
principals
it
a
rotten
arrangement
he
added
they
come
through
sometimes
and
use
our
lavatory
because
it
a
little
more
fancy
and
because
it
saves
a
trip
down
a
flight
of
stairs
believe
me
it
gets
old
manton
on
his
ear
vii
enid
faye
behind
werner
was
the
assistant
director
to
whom
i
had
given
little
attention
at
the
time
of
the
examination
of
the
various
people
in
the
phelps
library
even
now
he
impressed
me
as
one
of
those
rare
unobtrusive
types
of
individuals
who
seem
in
spite
of
the
possession
of
genuine
ability
and
often
a
great
deal
of
efficiency
to
lack
nevertheless
any
outstanding
personal
characteristics
as
a
class
they
are
human
machines
to
be
neither
liked
nor
disliked
never
intruding
and
yet
always
on
hand
when
needed
this
is
carey
drexel
my
assistant
werner
stated
forgetting
that
kennedy
had
questioned
him
at
tarrytown
and
so
knew
him
there
are
a
few
people
i
simply
must
see
and
i
tied
up
therefore
for
perhaps
half
an
hour
and
manton
downstairs
still
trying
to
locate
millard
for
you
but
carey
at
your
disposal
kennedy
to
show
you
the
arrangement
of
the
studio
and
to
cooperate
with
you
in
any
way
if
you
think
there
any
possible
chance
of
finding
anything
to
bear
upon
stella
death
here
if
werner
was
the
man
who
had
used
the
towel
i
could
see
that
he
was
an
actor
and
a
cool
villain
of
course
no
one
could
know
yet
that
we
had
discovered
it
but
the
very
nonchalance
with
which
it
had
been
thrown
into
the
basket
was
a
mark
of
the
nerve
of
the
guilty
man
it
was
more
than
carelessness
nothing
about
the
crime
had
been
haphazard
kennedy
thanked
werner
and
asked
to
be
shown
the
studio
floor
used
in
the
making
of
the
black
terror
carey
led
the
way
explaining
that
there
were
actually
two
studios
one
at
each
end
of
the
quadrangle
connected
on
both
sides
by
the
other
buildings
offices
and
dressing
rooms
and
the
costume
and
property
departments
at
the
side
facing
the
street
technical
laboratories
and
all
the
detail
of
film
manufacture
in
a
structure
to
the
rear
most
of
werner
own
picture
was
being
made
in
the
big
studio
reached
through
the
dressing
rooms
from
the
end
of
the
corridor
where
we
stood
i
had
been
in
film
plants
before
but
when
we
entered
the
huge
inclosure
beyond
the
long
hallway
of
dressing
rooms
i
was
impressed
by
the
fact
that
here
was
a
place
of
genuine
magnitude
with
more
life
and
bustle
than
anything
i
had
ever
imagined
the
glass
had
however
been
painted
over
because
of
late
years
dark
stages
with
the
even
quality
of
artificial
light
had
come
into
vogue
in
the
manton
studios
in
place
of
stages
lighted
by
the
uneven
and
undependable
sunlight
the
two
big
sets
mentioned
by
manton
a
banquet
hall
and
a
ballroom
were
being
erected
simultaneously
carpenters
were
at
work
sawing
and
hammering
werner
technical
director
was
shouting
at
a
group
of
stage
hands
putting
a
massive
mirror
in
position
at
the
end
of
the
banquet
hall
a
clever
device
to
give
the
room
the
appearance
of
at
least
double
its
actual
length
in
one
corner
several
electricians
and
a
camera
man
were
experimenting
with
a
bank
of
lights
in
the
ballroom
set
where
the
flats
or
walls
were
all
in
place
an
unexcited
paperhanger
was
busy
with
the
paraphernalia
of
his
craft
somehow
looking
out
of
his
element
in
this
reign
of
pandemonium
it
seemed
hard
indeed
to
believe
that
any
sort
of
order
or
system
lay
behind
this
heterogeneous
activity
and
the
incident
which
took
carey
drexel
away
from
us
only
added
to
the
wonder
in
my
mind
a
wonder
that
anything
tangible
and
definite
could
be
accomplished
oh
carey
another
assistant
director
or
perhaps
he
was
only
a
property
boy
rushed
up
frantically
the
moment
he
saw
drexel
miss
miller
on
a
rampage
because
the
grand
piano
you
promised
to
get
for
her
is
at
her
apartment
yet
and
bessie
terry
in
tears
because
she
left
her
parrot
here
overnight
as
you
suggested
and
some
one
taught
the
bird
to
swear
the
intruder
a
youth
of
perhaps
eighteen
was
in
deadly
earnest
for
the
love
of
mike
carey
he
went
on
tell
me
how
to
unteach
that
screeching
thing
of
bessie
or
we
wo
get
a
scene
today
carey
drexel
looked
at
kennedy
helplessly
with
all
these
troubles
how
could
he
pilot
us
about
later
we
learned
that
this
was
nothing
new
once
one
gets
on
the
inside
of
picture
making
or
properties
particularly
the
living
ones
cause
almost
as
much
disturbance
as
the
temperamental
notions
of
the
actors
and
actresses
sometimes
it
is
a
question
which
may
become
the
most
ridiculous
kennedy
seemed
to
be
satisfied
with
his
preliminary
visit
to
this
studio
floor
we
can
get
back
to
manton
office
alone
he
told
drexel
we
will
just
keep
on
circling
the
quadrangle
relieved
the
assistant
director
pointed
to
the
door
of
the
manufacturing
building
as
the
structure
in
the
rear
was
called
then
he
bustled
off
with
the
other
youth
quite
unruffled
himself
when
we
passed
through
the
heavy
steel
fire
door
we
found
ourselves
in
another
long
hallway
of
and
construction
unquestionably
there
was
no
danger
of
a
serious
conflagration
in
any
part
of
manton
plant
despite
the
high
inflammability
of
the
film
itself
of
the
flimsy
stage
sets
of
practically
everything
used
in
picture
manufacture
immediately
we
entered
this
building
i
detected
a
peculiar
odor
at
which
i
sniffed
eagerly
i
was
reminded
of
the
odor
of
the
cyanides
was
this
another
clue
i
turned
to
kennedy
but
he
smiled
anticipating
me
banana
oil
walter
he
explained
with
rather
a
superior
manner
i
imagine
it
used
a
great
deal
in
this
industry
anyway
a
chuckle
do
expect
chance
to
deliver
clues
to
you
in
wholesale
quantities
you
have
done
very
well
for
today
a
sudden
whirring
noise
from
an
open
door
down
the
hall
attracted
us
and
we
paused
this
i
guessed
was
a
cutting
room
there
were
a
number
of
steel
tables
with
high
steel
chairs
at
the
walls
were
cabinets
of
the
same
material
each
table
had
two
winding
arrangements
a
handle
at
the
operator
right
hand
and
one
at
his
left
so
that
he
could
wind
or
unwind
film
from
one
reel
to
another
passing
it
forward
or
backward
in
front
of
his
eyes
there
were
girls
at
the
tables
except
nearest
the
hall
here
a
man
stopped
now
and
then
to
glance
at
the
ribbon
of
film
or
to
cut
out
a
section
dropping
the
discarded
piece
into
a
fireproof
can
and
splicing
the
two
ends
of
the
main
strip
together
again
with
liquid
film
cement
from
a
small
bottle
he
looked
up
as
he
sensed
our
presence
is
it
hell
he
remarked
in
friendly
fashion
i
got
to
cut
all
of
stella
lamar
out
of
black
terror
so
they
can
duplicate
her
scenes
with
another
star
and
meanwhile
we
had
half
the
negative
matched
and
marked
for
colors
and
spliced
in
rolls
all
ready
for
the
printer
without
waiting
for
an
answer
from
us
or
expecting
one
he
gave
one
of
his
reels
a
vicious
spin
producing
the
whirring
noise
then
grasping
both
reels
between
his
fingers
and
bringing
them
to
an
abrupt
stop
so
that
i
wondered
he
did
not
burn
himself
from
the
friction
he
located
the
next
piece
to
be
eliminated
we
followed
the
hall
into
the
smaller
studio
and
there
found
a
comedy
company
at
work
without
stopping
to
watch
the
players
ghastly
under
the
light
from
the
and
kliegel
arcs
we
found
a
precarious
way
back
of
the
set
around
and
under
stage
braces
to
the
covered
bridge
leading
once
more
to
the
corridor
outside
office
now
the
girl
was
absent
from
her
place
in
the
little
waiting
room
manton
door
stood
open
without
ceremony
kennedy
led
the
way
in
and
dropped
down
at
the
side
of
the
promoter
huge
mahogany
desk
i
tired
walter
he
said
furthermore
i
think
this
picture
world
of
yours
is
a
bedlam
we
face
a
hard
task
how
do
you
propose
to
go
about
things
i
asked
i
afraid
this
is
a
case
which
will
have
to
be
approached
entirely
through
psychological
reactions
you
and
i
will
have
to
become
familiar
with
the
studio
and
home
life
of
all
the
long
list
of
possible
suspects
i
shall
analyze
the
body
fluids
of
the
deceased
and
learn
the
cause
of
death
and
i
will
find
out
what
it
is
on
the
towel
but
sighing
there
are
so
many
different
ramifications
so
many
suddenly
his
eye
caught
the
corner
of
a
piece
of
paper
slid
under
the
glass
of
manton
desk
he
pulled
it
out
then
handed
it
to
me
memorandum
for
manton
have
learned
enid
faye
is
out
of
pentangle
and
can
be
engaged
for
about
twelve
hundred
if
you
act
quickly
why
not
cancel
lamar
contract
after
black
terror
if
she
continues
werner
i
caught
the
name
lamar
kennedy
explained
then
an
expression
of
gratification
crept
into
his
face
miss
lamar
was
he
mused
that
a
theatrical
word
for
cussedness
is
it
i
paid
little
attention
the
name
of
enid
faye
had
attracted
my
own
interest
this
was
the
little
who
had
breezed
into
the
pacific
coast
film
colony
and
had
swept
everything
before
her
not
only
had
she
displayed
amazing
nerve
for
her
sex
and
size
but
she
had
been
pretty
and
beautifully
formed
had
been
as
much
at
home
in
a
ballroom
as
in
an
annette
kellermann
bathing
suit
in
less
than
six
months
she
had
learned
to
act
and
had
been
brought
to
the
eastern
studios
of
pentangle
now
it
was
possible
that
she
would
be
captured
by
manton
would
be
blazoned
all
over
the
country
by
that
gentleman
would
become
another
star
of
his
making
let
go
walter
kennedy
impatient
rose
i
noticed
that
he
folded
the
little
note
slipping
it
into
his
pocket
out
in
the
hall
voices
came
to
us
from
werner
office
after
some
little
hesitation
kennedy
opened
the
door
unceremoniously
at
the
table
littered
with
blue
prints
and
drawings
and
colored
plates
of
famous
home
interiors
was
the
director
with
him
was
manton
seated
facing
them
in
rare
good
humor
was
a
fascinating
little
lady
the
promoter
rose
professor
kennedy
i
want
you
to
meet
miss
enid
faye
one
of
our
real
comers
and
jameson
enid
of
the
new
york
star
she
acknowledged
the
introduction
to
kennedy
gracefully
then
she
turned
rising
and
rushed
to
me
most
effusively
leading
me
to
a
couch
and
pulling
me
to
a
seat
beside
her
jameson
she
purred
i
just
love
newspaper
men
i
think
perfectly
wonderful
always
tell
me
do
you
like
little
enid
i
nodded
confused
and
unhappy
and
as
red
as
a
schoolboy
that
fine
she
went
on
in
the
best
modulated
and
most
wonderful
voice
i
thought
i
had
ever
heard
i
like
you
and
i
know
we
going
to
be
the
best
of
friends
tell
me
what
your
first
name
now
enid
reproved
manton
in
fatherly
tones
you
have
plenty
of
time
to
vamp
your
publicity
later
for
the
present
please
listen
to
me
we
talking
business
shoot
every
hair
of
this
old
gray
head
she
directed
pertly
she
did
not
move
away
however
i
could
feel
the
warmth
of
her
could
catch
the
delicacy
of
the
perfume
she
used
i
noted
the
play
of
her
slender
fingers
the
trimness
of
her
ankle
the
piquancy
of
a
nose
revealed
to
me
in
profile
and
nothing
else
this
is
your
chance
enid
manton
continued
earnestly
and
rather
eagerly
you
know
the
film
will
be
the
most
talked
about
one
this
year
we
got
the
merritt
papers
lined
up
and
that
the
best
advertising
in
the
world
everyone
will
know
you
took
stella
place
and
well
you
step
right
in
she
studied
the
tips
of
her
boots
stretching
boyish
limbs
straight
in
front
of
her
then
smoothing
the
soft
folds
of
her
skirt
talk
money
to
me
mr
man
she
exclaimed
talk
the
shekels
the
golden
shekels
we
broke
he
protested
a
thousand
she
shook
her
head
werner
broke
in
suddenly
anxious
do
pass
up
the
chance
enid
he
pleaded
what
can
pentangle
do
for
you
and
i
always
wanted
to
direct
you
again
i
make
it
twelve
hundred
manton
interrupted
if
you
make
the
contract
personally
with
me
then
if
manton
pictures
all
right
she
jumped
to
her
feet
extending
a
hand
straight
forward
to
each
the
right
to
manton
the
left
to
werner
you
on
i
thought
that
i
was
forgotten
a
wave
of
jealousy
swept
over
me
after
all
she
simply
wanted
me
to
write
her
up
in
a
daze
i
heard
manton
you
a
wise
little
girl
enid
he
told
her
play
the
game
right
with
me
and
you
climb
high
the
sky
the
limit
now
i
make
you
make
you
big
with
a
full
warm
smile
she
swung
around
to
me
and
i
knew
i
was
not
being
slighted
after
all
that
what
longfellow
said
is
it
mr
jameson
what
my
heart
began
to
beat
like
a
trip
hammer
excelsior
excelsior
it
packs
them
in
she
laughed
so
infectiously
that
we
all
joined
in
then
manton
turned
to
kennedy
i
located
millard
for
you
he
to
meet
us
at
my
apartment
at
seven
it
now
and
you
enid
facing
her
if
come
too
there
another
man
i
want
you
to
meet
and
larry
of
course
will
be
there
enid
studied
kennedy
he
was
hesitating
as
though
not
sure
whether
to
accompany
manton
or
not
i
never
did
learn
what
other
course
of
action
had
occurred
to
him
but
i
did
notice
that
the
little
star
with
her
pert
upturned
face
seemed
more
anxious
to
have
kennedy
go
along
than
she
was
to
meet
the
mysterious
individual
mentioned
without
name
by
manton
for
an
instant
she
was
on
the
point
of
addressing
him
flippantly
no
doubt
then
i
think
she
was
rather
awed
at
craig
reputation
all
at
once
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
turned
to
me
plucking
my
sleeve
her
expression
brightening
irresistibly
you
come
too
dimpling
jamie
viii
lawrence
millard
it
struck
me
on
the
trip
to
manton
apartment
that
the
film
people
were
wholly
unfeeling
were
even
uninterested
in
the
death
of
stella
lamar
except
where
it
interfered
with
their
business
arrangements
werner
excused
himself
and
did
not
accompany
us
on
the
score
of
the
complete
realignment
of
production
necessary
to
place
enid
in
part
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
felt
a
certain
relish
in
the
problem
that
he
was
almost
glad
of
the
circumstances
which
brought
enid
to
him
his
last
words
to
manton
were
to
be
sure
to
have
millard
recast
the
action
of
the
scenes
wherever
possible
so
as
to
give
enid
the
better
chance
to
display
her
own
personality
i
marveled
as
i
realized
that
the
remains
of
stella
lamar
were
scarcely
cold
before
these
people
were
figuring
on
the
star
to
take
her
place
as
manton
talked
the
thought
crossed
my
mind
that
such
a
man
needed
no
publicity
manager
i
dismissed
the
idea
that
he
might
be
capable
even
of
murder
for
publicity
but
at
least
it
was
an
insight
into
some
methods
of
the
game
as
our
car
mounted
to
the
concourse
and
turned
manhattanward
i
was
distinctly
unhappy
manton
monopolized
enid
completely
insisting
upon
talking
over
everything
under
the
sun
from
the
wardrobe
she
would
need
in
stella
part
and
the
best
sort
of
personal
advertising
campaign
for
her
to
the
first
available
evening
when
she
could
go
to
dinner
with
him
she
sat
in
the
rear
seat
between
kennedy
and
the
promoter
which
did
not
add
to
my
sense
of
comfort
the
only
consoling
feature
from
my
viewpoint
was
that
i
was
admirably
placed
to
study
her
and
that
manton
held
her
so
engrossed
that
i
had
every
opportunity
to
do
so
unnoticed
because
she
had
overwhelmed
me
so
completely
i
did
nothing
of
the
kind
i
knew
we
were
riding
with
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
new
york
but
i
did
not
know
the
color
of
her
hair
or
eyes
or
even
the
sort
of
hat
or
dress
she
wore
in
short
i
was
we
stopped
at
last
at
a
huge
ornate
apartment
house
on
riverside
drive
and
manton
led
the
way
through
the
wide
renaissance
entrance
and
the
luxurious
marble
hall
to
the
elevator
his
quarters
on
the
top
floor
facing
the
river
were
almost
exotic
in
the
lavishness
and
barbaric
splendor
of
their
furnishings
my
first
impression
as
we
entered
the
place
was
that
manton
had
purposely
planned
the
dim
lights
of
rich
amber
and
the
clinging
oriental
fragrance
hovering
about
everything
so
as
to
produce
an
alluring
and
enticing
atmosphere
the
chairs
and
wide
upholstered
window
seats
the
soft
yielding
divans
in
at
least
two
corners
with
their
miniature
mountains
of
tiny
pillows
all
were
comfortable
with
the
comfort
one
associates
with
lotus
eating
and
that
homeward
journey
soon
to
be
forgotten
there
was
the
smoke
of
incense
unmistakably
on
a
taboret
were
cigarettes
and
cigars
and
through
heavy
curtains
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
sideboard
and
decanters
filled
and
set
out
very
frankly
a
japanese
butler
whom
manton
called
huroki
took
our
hats
and
retreated
with
a
certain
emanating
effluvium
of
subtlety
such
as
i
had
known
only
once
before
when
the
oriental
attendant
left
me
on
the
occasion
of
my
only
visit
to
an
opium
den
in
chinatown
a
moment
later
millard
who
had
been
waiting
rose
to
greet
us
i
would
have
guessed
him
to
be
an
author
i
believe
had
i
met
him
at
random
anywhere
in
the
city
he
affected
all
the
professional
marks
and
mannerisms
and
yet
he
did
so
gracefully
i
noticed
in
the
little
hall
where
huroki
placed
our
headgear
a
malacca
stick
a
and
felt
hat
and
a
battered
that
was
millard
unquestionably
the
man
himself
was
tall
and
heavy
with
an
appearance
of
slenderness
his
face
was
handsome
rather
intellectual
in
spite
of
rather
than
because
of
large
glasses
his
mouth
and
chin
showed
strength
and
determination
which
was
a
surprise
to
me
in
fact
in
no
way
did
he
seem
to
reveal
the
artist
lawrence
millard
was
a
commercial
writer
a
dreamer
never
first
he
greeted
enid
taking
both
of
her
hands
in
his
in
this
one
brief
moment
all
my
own
little
romance
went
glimmering
for
i
could
not
blind
myself
to
the
softening
of
his
expression
the
welcoming
light
in
hers
the
long
interval
in
which
their
fingers
remained
interlaced
and
then
another
thought
came
to
me
hastened
fed
and
fattened
upon
my
jealousy
the
sealed
testimony
in
the
case
of
millard
millard
could
enid
by
any
chance
be
concerned
in
that
the
next
moment
i
dismissed
the
thought
or
at
least
i
thought
i
did
so
i
tried
to
picture
enid
work
on
the
coast
to
remember
the
short
time
she
had
been
in
the
east
it
was
possible
millard
had
known
her
before
she
went
to
los
angeles
but
unlikely
millard
next
turned
to
kennedy
i
just
learned
of
the
tragedy
a
short
while
ago
professor
he
exclaimed
it
is
terrible
and
so
amazingly
sudden
too
it
it
has
upset
me
completely
tell
me
have
you
found
anything
have
you
discovered
any
possible
clue
is
there
anything
at
all
i
can
do
to
help
i
would
like
to
ask
a
few
questions
kennedy
explained
by
all
means
he
extended
a
hand
to
me
and
i
found
it
damp
and
flabby
as
though
he
were
more
concerned
than
his
manner
betrayed
he
faced
kennedy
again
however
immediately
stella
and
i
did
make
a
go
of
our
married
life
at
all
he
went
on
frankly
enough
i
was
very
sorry
too
because
i
was
genuinely
fond
of
her
how
recently
have
you
seen
her
stella
not
for
over
a
month
perhaps
longer
than
that
manton
took
enid
by
the
arm
it
was
evidently
her
first
visit
to
the
apartment
and
he
was
anxious
to
show
her
his
various
treasures
millard
kennedy
and
i
found
a
corner
affording
a
view
out
over
the
hudson
after
kennedy
had
described
briefly
the
circumstances
of
stella
death
at
millard
insistence
he
produced
the
note
he
had
found
in
her
handbag
the
author
recognized
it
at
once
without
reading
it
yes
i
wrote
that
then
just
a
trace
of
emotion
crept
into
his
voice
i
was
too
late
he
murmured
what
was
it
you
wanted
to
say
kennedy
inquired
millard
glance
traveled
to
manton
and
enid
a
troubled
something
in
his
expression
i
could
see
that
the
promoter
was
making
the
most
of
his
with
the
girl
but
she
seemed
perfectly
at
ease
and
quite
capable
of
handling
the
man
and
i
certainly
was
more
disturbed
at
the
interest
of
millard
i
thought
there
was
something
about
the
business
i
ought
to
tell
stella
he
answered
finally
manton
pictures
is
pretty
shaky
oh
then
manton
was
talking
for
effect
when
he
told
miss
faye
that
the
company
was
broke
no
indeed
in
fact
did
enid
make
her
agreement
with
manton
personally
that
what
i
advised
her
to
do
kennedy
nodded
but
is
manton
himself
financially
sound
millard
laughed
lloyd
manton
always
has
a
dozen
things
up
his
sleeve
he
may
have
a
million
or
he
may
owe
a
million
in
the
author
voice
was
no
respect
for
his
employer
a
touch
of
malice
crept
into
his
tone
manton
will
make
money
for
anyone
who
can
make
money
for
him
he
added
that
is
provided
he
has
to
do
it
kennedy
and
i
exchanged
glances
this
was
close
to
an
assertion
of
downright
dishonesty
at
that
moment
huroki
stole
in
on
padded
feet
as
noiseless
as
a
wraith
yes
huroki
his
master
turned
inquiringly
leigh
was
the
butler
announcement
show
him
in
said
manton
then
he
hurried
over
to
us
courtlandt
leigh
the
banker
you
know
i
imagine
i
showed
my
surprise
for
kennedy
smiled
as
he
caught
my
face
leigh
was
a
bigger
man
than
phelps
of
the
highest
standing
in
downtown
financial
circles
if
manton
had
interested
courtlandt
leigh
in
moving
pictures
he
was
a
wizard
indeed
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
banker
was
hardly
in
the
apartment
before
he
saw
enid
and
from
that
moment
the
girl
engrossed
him
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
for
enid
i
will
say
that
she
was
a
wonder
she
seemed
to
grasp
the
man
instant
infatuation
and
immediately
she
set
about
to
complete
the
conquest
all
without
permitting
him
so
much
as
to
touch
her
you
excuse
us
remarked
manton
easily
as
he
drew
phelps
and
enid
away
see
exclaimed
millard
in
a
low
voice
frowning
now
as
he
watched
the
girl
manton
clever
i
never
known
him
unable
to
raise
money
and
that
why
i
wanted
enid
to
have
her
contract
with
him
personally
if
manton
pictures
blows
up
he
put
her
in
some
other
company
he
has
more
than
one
this
seemed
to
puzzle
kennedy
he
been
interested
in
any
number
on
the
side
millard
explained
now
he
formed
another
but
it
a
secret
so
far
you
heard
of
fortune
features
perhaps
kennedy
looked
at
me
but
i
shook
my
head
what
is
features
kennedy
asked
the
question
of
millard
just
another
company
in
which
manton
has
an
interest
he
replied
casually
that
was
why
i
said
i
advised
that
enid
make
her
contract
personally
with
manton
if
manton
pictures
goes
up
then
he
will
have
to
swing
her
into
fortune
features
the
other
manton
enterprise
you
see
he
paused
then
added
by
the
way
do
say
anything
outside
about
that
it
is
generally
known
and
as
soon
as
anyone
does
hear
it
everybody
in
the
film
game
will
hear
it
you
do
know
how
gossip
travels
in
this
business
kennedy
asked
a
few
personal
questions
about
stella
but
answers
indicated
that
he
had
not
contemplated
or
even
hoped
for
a
reconciliation
that
his
interest
in
his
former
wife
had
become
thoroughly
platonic
just
now
however
he
seemed
unable
to
keep
manton
out
of
his
mind
oh
manton
clever
he
said
confidentially
to
kennedy
as
he
watched
the
promoter
deftly
maneuvering
leigh
and
enid
into
a
position
side
by
side
and
indeed
as
millard
talked
i
began
to
get
some
inkling
of
how
really
clever
was
the
game
which
manton
played
why
continued
millard
warming
up
to
his
story
for
to
him
above
all
a
good
story
was
something
that
had
to
be
told
whatever
might
result
from
it
i
have
known
him
to
pay
a
visit
some
afternoon
to
wall
street
go
down
there
to
beard
the
old
lions
in
their
den
he
always
used
to
show
up
about
the
closing
time
of
the
market
i
known
him
to
get
into
the
office
of
some
one
like
leigh
or
phelps
then
he
begin
to
talk
about
his
brilliant
prospects
in
the
company
he
happens
to
be
promoting
at
the
time
if
you
listen
to
manton
you
lost
i
know
it
i
listened
he
added
whimsically
well
he
continued
the
banker
will
begin
to
get
restless
after
a
bit
not
at
manton
but
at
not
getting
away
car
is
outside
manton
will
say
me
drive
you
uptown
of
course
there
nothing
else
for
the
banker
to
do
but
to
accept
and
when
he
gets
into
car
he
glad
he
did
i
do
know
anyone
who
picks
out
such
luxurious
things
as
he
does
why
that
man
could
walk
right
out
along
automobile
row
broke
and
some
one
would
give
him
a
car
how
does
he
do
it
i
put
the
question
to
him
how
does
a
fish
swim
said
millard
smiling
he
clever
i
tell
you
once
he
has
the
banker
in
the
car
perhaps
they
stop
for
a
few
moments
at
a
club
at
any
rate
manton
usually
contrives
it
so
that
as
they
approach
his
apartment
he
has
his
talk
all
worked
up
to
the
point
where
the
banker
is
genuinely
interested
you
know
there
almost
nothing
people
will
talk
to
you
longer
about
than
moving
pictures
well
on
one
pretext
or
another
manton
usually
persuades
the
banker
to
step
up
here
for
a
moment
poor
simp
it
all
over
with
him
then
i
never
forget
how
impressed
phelps
was
with
this
place
the
first
time
there
now
watch
this
fellow
leigh
he
thinks
this
looks
like
a
million
dollars
we
all
here
playing
manton
game
we
his
menagerie
he
barnum
i
tell
you
leigh
lost
lost
i
did
not
know
quite
what
to
make
of
millard
cynicism
was
he
trying
to
be
witty
at
manton
expense
i
noticed
that
he
did
not
smile
himself
although
he
was
talking
to
us
his
attention
was
not
really
on
us
he
was
still
watching
enid
then
along
would
happen
stella
as
if
by
chance
millard
paused
bitterly
as
though
he
did
not
quite
relish
the
telling
it
but
felt
that
kennedy
would
pry
it
out
of
him
or
some
one
else
finally
and
he
might
as
well
have
it
over
with
frankly
yes
he
said
thoughtfully
but
it
all
was
really
manton
fault
after
all
stella
liked
the
bohemian
sort
of
life
too
much
and
manton
does
the
bohemian
up
here
wonderfully
it
was
too
much
for
stella
then
when
phelps
came
along
and
was
roped
in
she
fell
for
him
it
was
poor
millard
i
was
rapid
enough
for
that
crowd
i
almost
began
to
sympathize
with
millard
in
the
association
into
which
for
his
living
sake
his
art
had
forced
him
i
realized
too
that
really
the
banker
the
wise
one
from
wall
street
was
the
sucker
indeed
as
millard
told
it
i
could
easily
account
for
the
temptation
of
stella
to
a
degree
i
suppose
it
was
really
her
fault
for
she
ought
to
have
known
the
game
shown
more
sense
than
to
be
taken
in
by
the
thing
i
wondered
at
the
continued
relations
of
millard
with
manton
under
the
circumstances
however
i
reflected
if
stella
had
chosen
to
play
the
little
fool
why
should
millard
have
allowed
that
to
ruin
his
own
chances
what
interested
me
now
was
that
millard
did
not
seem
to
relish
the
attentions
which
the
banker
was
paying
to
enid
was
manton
framing
up
the
same
sort
of
game
again
on
leigh
however
when
enid
shot
a
quick
glance
at
millard
in
an
aside
of
the
conversation
accompanied
by
a
merry
wink
i
saw
that
millard
though
still
doubtful
was
much
more
at
ease
evidently
there
was
a
tacit
understanding
between
the
two
kennedy
glanced
over
at
me
bit
by
bit
the
checkered
history
of
stella
lamar
life
was
coming
to
light
i
began
to
see
more
clearly
deserting
millard
and
fascinated
by
manton
and
his
game
she
had
been
used
to
interest
phelps
in
the
company
in
turn
she
had
been
dazzled
by
the
glitter
of
the
phelps
gold
she
had
not
proved
loyal
even
to
the
producer
and
promoter
perhaps
i
reflected
that
was
why
millard
was
so
apparently
complacent
one
could
not
under
the
circumstances
have
expected
him
to
display
wild
emotion
his
attitude
had
been
that
of
one
who
thought
she
almost
broke
me
let
her
break
some
one
else
that
however
was
not
his
attitude
toward
enid
now
indeed
he
seemed
genuinely
concerned
that
she
should
not
follow
in
the
same
steps
later
i
learned
that
was
not
all
of
the
history
of
stella
fifteen
hundred
dollars
a
week
of
her
own
money
besides
lavish
presents
had
been
too
much
for
her
even
phelps
money
had
had
no
attraction
for
her
the
world
at
least
that
part
of
it
which
spends
money
on
broadway
had
been
open
to
her
jack
daring
had
charmed
her
for
a
while
hence
the
engagement
of
shirley
i
did
not
even
know
perhaps
the
masterful
crime
roles
he
played
might
have
promised
some
new
thrill
with
the
possibility
that
they
expressed
something
latent
in
his
life
at
any
rate
she
had
dilettanted
about
him
to
the
amazement
and
dismay
of
marilyn
that
we
knew
the
dinner
hour
was
approaching
and
in
spite
of
the
urgent
invitation
of
manton
leigh
was
forced
to
excuse
himself
to
keep
a
previous
appointment
i
felt
though
that
he
would
have
broken
it
if
only
enid
had
added
her
urging
but
she
did
not
much
to
the
relief
of
millard
manton
took
it
in
good
part
perhaps
he
was
wise
enough
to
reflect
that
many
other
afternoons
were
in
the
lap
of
the
future
what
is
manton
up
to
kennedy
spoke
to
millard
is
it
off
with
the
old
and
on
with
the
new
is
phelps
to
be
cast
aside
like
a
lemon
and
leigh
taken
on
for
a
new
citrus
fruit
millard
smiled
he
said
nothing
but
the
knowing
glance
was
confirmation
enough
that
in
his
opinion
kennedy
had
expressed
the
state
of
affairs
correctly
millard
hastened
to
the
side
of
enid
at
once
and
we
learned
then
that
they
had
a
theater
engagement
together
and
that
millard
had
the
tickets
in
his
pocket
once
more
i
realized
it
was
no
new
or
recent
acquaintanceship
between
these
two
again
i
wondered
what
woman
had
been
named
in
stella
lamar
divorce
suit
and
again
dismissed
the
thought
that
it
could
be
enid
kennedy
took
his
hat
and
handed
me
mine
we
must
eat
walter
as
well
as
the
rest
of
them
he
remarked
when
manton
led
the
way
to
the
door
i
was
loath
to
leave
and
i
suppose
i
showed
it
the
truth
was
that
little
enid
faye
had
captivated
me
it
was
hard
to
tear
myself
away
in
the
entrance
i
hesitated
wondering
whether
i
should
say
to
her
she
seemed
engrossed
with
millard
a
second
time
she
took
me
clean
off
my
feet
while
i
stood
there
foolishly
she
left
millard
and
rushed
up
extending
her
little
hand
and
allowing
it
to
rest
for
a
moment
clasped
in
mine
we
did
have
a
single
opportunity
to
get
acquainted
jameson
she
complained
real
regret
in
the
soft
cadences
of
her
voice
you
phone
me
sometime
my
name
in
the
book
or
i
be
at
the
studio
i
was
my
glance
shifting
from
hers
because
i
was
suddenly
afraid
of
myself
encountered
the
gaze
of
millard
from
behind
now
i
detected
the
unmistakable
fire
of
jealousy
in
the
eyes
of
the
author
i
presume
i
was
never
built
to
be
a
heavy
lover
up
and
down
my
spine
went
a
shiver
of
fear
i
dropped
enid
hand
and
turned
away
abruptly
ix
shadows
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
asked
kennedy
when
we
were
half
through
our
meal
at
a
tiny
restaurant
on
upper
broadway
we
still
fumbling
in
the
dark
he
replied
there
the
towel
yes
and
almost
any
one
on
mackay
list
of
nine
suspects
could
have
placed
it
in
that
washroom
well
i
was
determined
to
draw
him
out
my
own
impressions
i
must
confess
were
gloriously
muddled
manton
heads
the
list
i
suggested
everyone
says
she
was
mixed
up
with
him
manton
may
have
philandered
with
her
undoubtedly
he
takes
a
personal
interest
in
all
his
stars
kennedy
i
saw
remembered
the
close
attentions
to
enid
faye
nevertheless
walter
he
is
first
and
foremost
and
all
the
time
the
man
of
business
his
heart
is
in
his
dollars
and
millard
even
suggests
that
he
is
none
too
scrupulous
if
he
had
an
affair
with
stella
i
rejoined
and
she
became
the
note
you
found
suggested
trouble
you
know
then
manton
in
a
burst
of
passion
no
kennedy
stopped
me
do
forget
that
this
was
a
calculated
crime
i
not
eliminating
manton
yet
but
until
we
find
some
tangible
evidence
of
trouble
between
stella
and
himself
we
can
hardly
assume
he
would
kill
the
girl
who
made
him
perhaps
a
million
dollars
every
motive
in
manton
case
is
a
motive
against
the
crime
that
eliminates
phelps
then
too
he
nearly
owned
the
company
yes
unless
something
happened
to
outweigh
financial
considerations
in
his
mind
also
but
good
heavens
kennedy
i
protested
if
you
go
on
that
way
you
not
eliminate
anyone
i
ca
yet
he
explained
patiently
it
just
as
i
said
fishing
in
the
dark
absolutely
so
far
we
have
a
single
basic
fact
on
which
to
build
any
structure
of
hypothesis
we
must
go
on
fishing
i
expect
you
to
dig
up
all
the
facts
about
these
people
every
odd
bit
of
gossip
or
rumor
or
anything
else
i
bring
my
science
to
play
but
there
nothing
i
can
do
except
analyze
stella
stomach
contents
and
the
spots
on
the
towel
that
is
until
we
got
a
much
more
tangible
lead
than
any
which
have
developed
so
far
is
there
anything
i
can
do
yes
he
looked
at
his
watch
there
are
two
men
who
were
very
close
to
miss
lamar
jack
gordon
was
engaged
to
her
merle
shirley
seemed
to
have
been
mixed
up
with
her
seriously
all
the
picture
people
have
night
haunts
see
what
you
can
find
about
these
two
men
but
i
do
know
where
to
find
them
offhand
and
both
belong
to
the
goats
club
probably
try
that
as
a
start
i
nodded
and
began
to
hurry
my
dessert
but
i
could
not
resist
questioning
him
you
think
they
are
the
most
likely
suspects
no
but
they
were
intimately
associated
with
miss
lamar
in
her
daily
life
and
they
are
the
two
we
have
learned
the
least
about
oh
i
was
disappointed
then
i
rallied
to
the
attack
for
a
final
time
who
is
the
most
likely
one
just
satisfy
my
curiosity
craig
he
took
a
folded
note
from
his
pocket
opening
it
it
was
the
memorandum
from
manton
desk
which
i
had
mentioned
in
a
flash
i
understood
werner
i
exclaimed
they
said
he
was
mixed
up
with
her
too
he
was
the
first
back
and
out
of
the
car
and
he
had
time
to
clean
a
needle
on
the
towel
had
a
better
opportunity
than
anyone
else
more
i
began
to
get
excited
he
was
lying
on
the
floor
close
to
her
in
the
scene
and
could
have
jabbed
her
with
a
needle
very
easily
and
and
he
was
extremely
nervous
when
you
questioned
him
the
most
nervous
of
all
and
and
finally
he
had
a
motive
he
wanted
to
get
enid
faye
with
manton
pictures
as
this
note
shows
very
good
walter
kennedy
eyes
were
dancing
in
amusement
it
is
true
that
werner
had
the
best
motive
so
far
as
we
know
now
but
it
a
fantastic
one
men
do
commit
murder
just
to
create
a
vacancy
for
a
movie
star
if
werner
was
going
to
kill
miss
lamar
he
never
would
have
written
this
note
about
miss
faye
unless
to
divert
suspicion
i
suggested
he
shook
his
head
the
whole
thing
too
bizarre
werner
was
close
to
her
in
the
dark
all
the
other
things
point
to
him
do
they
it
too
bad
everyone
was
searched
at
that
kennedy
admitted
nevertheless
at
the
time
i
realized
that
werner
had
had
the
best
opportunity
for
the
actual
performance
of
the
crime
and
i
watched
him
very
closely
and
made
him
go
through
every
movement
just
so
i
could
study
him
i
believe
he
innocent
at
least
as
far
as
i
gone
in
the
case
i
determined
to
stick
to
my
opinion
i
believe
it
werner
i
insisted
by
the
time
you
dug
up
all
the
gossip
about
gordon
and
shirley
you
wo
be
so
sure
walter
i
was
however
kennedy
was
not
as
familiar
with
the
picture
world
as
i
had
heard
of
too
many
actual
happenings
more
strange
and
bizarre
and
wildly
fantastic
than
anything
conceivable
in
other
walks
of
life
people
in
the
film
game
as
they
call
it
live
highly
seasoned
lives
in
which
everything
is
exaggerated
the
mere
desire
to
make
a
place
for
enid
might
not
have
actuated
werner
granting
he
was
the
guilty
man
nevertheless
it
could
easily
have
contributed
and
it
struck
me
suddenly
an
additional
argument
that
werner
of
all
of
them
was
the
most
familiar
with
the
script
he
had
been
able
to
cast
himself
for
the
part
of
old
remsen
there
was
not
a
detail
which
he
could
not
have
arranged
very
skillfully
at
the
goats
club
i
was
lucky
to
discover
a
member
whom
i
knew
well
enough
to
take
into
my
confidence
by
stating
my
errand
he
was
one
of
the
star
former
special
writers
and
an
older
classman
of
the
college
which
had
graduated
kennedy
and
myself
merle
shirley
is
not
a
member
here
he
said
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
only
just
heard
the
name
but
jack
gordon
a
goat
worse
luck
that
fellow
a
bad
actor
in
real
life
and
a
disgrace
to
us
tell
me
all
you
know
about
him
i
asked
well
to
give
you
an
example
he
was
in
here
just
about
a
week
ago
i
was
sitting
in
the
grill
eating
an
supper
when
i
heard
the
most
terrible
racket
he
and
emery
phelps
the
banker
you
know
were
having
an
fight
right
out
in
the
lobby
it
took
three
of
the
men
to
separate
them
what
was
it
all
about
well
gordon
owes
money
right
and
left
not
a
few
hundred
or
some
little
personal
debts
like
that
but
thousands
and
thousands
of
dollars
i
got
it
from
some
of
the
other
men
here
that
he
has
been
speculating
on
the
curb
downtown
losing
consistently
more
than
that
he
engaged
to
stella
lamar
you
knew
that
and
he
been
blowing
money
on
her
then
they
tell
me
his
professional
work
is
suffering
that
his
recent
screen
appearances
are
terrible
the
result
of
late
hours
and
worry
i
suppose
the
fight
with
phelps
was
over
money
of
course
i
figure
that
he
kept
drawing
against
his
salary
at
the
studio
until
the
film
company
shut
down
on
him
then
probably
he
began
to
borrow
from
phelps
who
manton
backer
now
until
the
banker
shut
down
on
him
also
at
any
rate
phelps
had
begun
to
dun
him
and
it
led
to
the
fight
that
all
you
know
about
gordon
lord
is
it
enough
i
walked
out
of
the
club
and
toward
broadway
reflecting
upon
this
information
could
gordon
debts
have
any
bearing
upon
the
case
all
at
once
one
possibility
struck
me
he
had
been
borrowing
from
phelps
perhaps
he
had
borrowed
from
stella
also
perhaps
that
was
the
cause
of
their
quarrel
perhaps
she
had
threatened
to
make
trouble
it
was
a
slender
motive
but
worth
bringing
to
the
attention
of
kennedy
my
immediate
problem
however
was
to
obtain
some
information
about
merle
shirley
at
first
i
thought
i
would
make
the
rounds
of
some
of
the
cafes
but
that
seemed
a
hopeless
task
suddenly
i
remembered
belle
balcom
formerly
with
the
star
i
recollected
a
previous
case
of
kennedy
where
she
and
i
had
been
great
rivals
in
the
quest
of
news
i
recalled
a
trip
we
had
made
to
greenwich
village
together
belle
knew
more
people
about
town
than
any
other
newspaper
woman
now
for
some
months
she
had
been
connected
with
screenings
a
leading
cinema
fan
magazine
and
would
unquestionably
be
posted
upon
the
photoplayers
luckily
i
caught
her
at
home
bless
your
soul
she
told
me
over
the
phone
in
delight
i
just
been
aching
for
some
one
to
take
me
out
we
go
to
the
midnight
fads
and
if
shirley
is
there
the
head
waiter
will
tell
you
all
i
do
remember
it
was
a
glorious
fight
she
would
say
any
more
over
the
phone
but
i
was
hugely
curious
had
there
been
another
encounter
with
fists
and
who
had
been
involved
when
she
met
me
finally
at
the
subway
station
and
when
we
obtained
an
table
at
the
fads
she
explained
it
seemed
that
shirley
had
met
stella
there
a
number
of
times
and
that
gordon
at
last
had
got
wind
of
it
gordon
first
had
come
up
himself
quietly
pleading
with
stella
she
had
been
in
a
high
humor
and
had
refused
even
to
listen
to
him
then
he
had
become
insulting
at
that
shirley
knocked
him
down
the
head
waiter
a
witness
of
the
affair
ordered
gordon
put
out
but
did
not
request
shirley
or
stella
to
leave
because
the
other
man
had
been
the
aggressor
without
any
question
after
more
than
an
hour
gordon
returned
quietly
and
unobtrusively
with
another
girl
from
description
i
knew
it
was
marilyn
loring
taking
another
table
marilyn
had
stared
at
shirley
reproachfully
while
gordon
had
glared
at
stella
shirley
put
up
with
this
for
just
about
so
long
as
belle
described
it
his
face
gradually
became
more
and
more
red
and
he
controlled
himself
with
increasing
difficulty
stella
seeing
the
coming
of
the
storm
tried
to
get
him
to
go
he
refused
she
threatened
to
leave
him
he
paid
no
attention
all
at
once
he
boiled
over
and
with
great
strides
walked
over
to
gordon
and
mauled
him
all
over
the
place
the
leading
man
had
no
chance
whatever
in
the
hands
of
the
irate
westerner
several
waiters
attempting
to
intervene
were
flung
aside
only
when
shirley
began
to
cool
off
were
they
able
to
eject
the
two
men
both
stella
and
marilyn
had
left
separately
before
that
neither
of
the
men
or
women
had
been
at
the
fads
since
or
at
least
the
head
waiter
called
over
by
belle
so
informed
us
unable
to
obtain
any
other
facts
of
interest
i
returned
finally
to
the
apartment
shared
by
kennedy
and
myself
first
he
listened
to
my
account
plainly
interested
then
when
i
had
concluded
he
rose
and
faced
me
rather
gravely
it
getting
more
and
more
complicated
walter
he
exclaimed
after
you
left
i
remembered
that
there
was
one
point
of
investigation
i
had
failed
to
cover
miss
lamar
home
here
in
the
city
i
got
our
old
friend
on
the
wire
and
learned
that
at
the
request
of
mackay
from
tarrytown
they
had
sent
a
man
up
to
the
place
and
that
just
an
hour
or
less
before
i
called
they
had
located
and
were
holding
her
colored
maid
i
hurried
down
to
headquarters
and
questioned
the
girl
yes
to
me
it
sounded
promising
the
negress
did
know
a
thing
so
far
as
the
crime
is
concerned
kennedy
went
on
but
i
gained
quite
an
insight
into
the
private
life
of
the
star
you
mean
i
mean
i
know
the
men
who
went
to
miss
lamar
apartment
although
beyond
the
fact
of
her
receiving
them
i
can
tell
nothing
for
she
sent
the
maid
home
at
night
there
were
no
maid
quarters
their
visits
may
have
been
perfectly
innocent
of
course
we
can
only
draw
conclusions
who
were
the
various
callers
jack
gordon
her
fiance
merle
shirley
shirley
admitted
it
when
you
questioned
him
manton
everyone
knows
that
werner
a
side
glance
at
me
i
said
nothing
my
expression
spoke
for
me
and
emery
phelps
at
that
i
did
show
surprise
although
mackay
had
hinted
at
something
of
the
kind
i
for
one
had
not
considered
the
banker
seriously
good
heavens
kennedy
i
exploded
she
was
mixed
up
with
just
about
every
man
connected
with
the
company
exactly
as
usual
he
seemed
calm
and
unconcerned
i
could
regard
the
case
only
with
increasing
amazement
the
bitter
conflicting
emotions
of
manton
and
phelps
of
daring
shirley
and
millard
with
them
all
stella
had
been
the
pretty
trouble
maker
how
do
you
suppose
they
could
all
remain
in
the
same
company
i
showed
my
surprise
at
the
situation
kennedy
pondered
a
moment
then
replied
a
moment
reflection
ought
to
give
you
one
answer
i
think
walter
they
were
either
under
contract
or
they
had
their
money
in
the
company
they
could
break
i
suppose
so
what
i
wonder
is
was
marilyn
as
jealous
of
stella
as
her
screen
character
would
make
her
in
a
story
she
the
only
one
we
do
hear
much
about
kennedy
did
not
seem
at
least
at
present
to
give
this
phase
of
it
anything
like
the
weight
he
credited
to
the
frenzied
financial
relations
the
case
was
uncovering
it
was
true
as
i
learned
later
that
manton
was
at
that
very
moment
doing
perhaps
as
much
as
anyone
else
ever
did
to
discredit
the
picture
game
in
wall
street
x
chemical
research
the
following
morning
i
found
kennedy
up
ahead
of
me
and
i
felt
certain
that
he
had
gone
to
the
laboratory
sure
enough
i
found
him
at
work
in
the
midst
of
the
innumerable
scientific
devices
which
he
had
gathered
during
years
of
crime
detection
of
every
sort
as
usual
he
was
surrounded
by
a
perfect
litter
of
test
tubes
beakers
reagents
microscopes
slides
and
culture
tubes
he
had
cut
out
the
curious
spots
from
the
towel
i
had
discovered
and
was
studying
them
to
determine
their
nature
from
the
mass
of
paraphernalia
i
knew
he
was
neglecting
no
possibility
which
might
lead
to
the
hidden
truth
or
produce
a
clue
to
the
crime
have
you
learned
anything
yet
i
asked
those
brownish
spots
were
blood
of
course
was
his
reply
as
he
stopped
a
moment
in
his
work
in
the
blood
i
discovered
some
other
substance
though
i
ca
seem
to
identify
it
yet
it
will
take
time
i
thought
it
might
be
a
drug
or
poison
but
it
does
seem
to
be
at
least
nothing
one
might
ordinarily
expect
how
about
the
other
spots
not
the
chinese
yellow
another
problem
i
have
solved
i
dissolved
enough
of
them
so
that
i
have
plenty
of
material
to
study
if
i
do
waste
it
but
so
far
i
have
been
able
to
identify
the
substance
with
anything
i
know
there
a
lot
more
work
of
elimination
walter
before
we
on
the
road
to
the
solution
of
this
case
whatever
stained
the
towel
was
very
unusual
as
near
as
i
can
make
out
the
spots
are
of
some
protein
composition
but
it
not
exactly
a
poison
although
many
proteins
may
be
extremely
poisonous
and
extremely
difficult
to
identify
because
they
are
of
organic
nature
i
was
disappointed
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
had
made
comparatively
little
progress
so
far
there
one
thing
he
added
samples
of
the
body
fluids
of
the
victim
have
been
sent
down
by
the
coroner
at
tarrytown
and
i
have
analyzed
them
while
i
have
decided
what
it
was
that
killed
stella
lamar
i
am
at
least
convinced
that
it
has
something
to
do
with
these
towel
spots
they
are
not
exactly
the
same
in
fact
i
should
say
they
were
complementary
or
perhaps
better
antithetical
the
mark
was
made
by
the
needle
which
scratched
her
then
that
what
i
thought
at
first
that
the
point
used
had
been
wiped
off
on
the
towel
then
i
decided
that
the
spots
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
at
all
now
i
believe
there
is
some
connection
after
all
i
i
do
understand
it
i
protested
it
very
baffling
he
agreed
if
the
towel
was
used
to
clean
the
fatal
needle
i
went
on
then
it
may
have
been
used
before
they
went
out
instead
of
afterward
exactly
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
i
had
not
been
so
confused
yesterday
by
all
the
details
of
the
case
by
the
many
people
involved
i
would
have
noticed
at
a
glance
that
the
blood
spots
on
the
towel
could
not
come
from
some
one
using
it
to
wipe
the
needle
and
any
hypothesis
that
it
had
been
used
out
in
tarrytown
was
ridiculous
because
miss
lamar
was
only
scratched
faintly
and
lost
no
blood
if
i
had
been
a
little
more
clever
i
might
have
been
altogether
too
clever
i
might
possibly
have
thrown
the
towel
away
because
there
certainly
was
no
logical
reason
for
connecting
it
with
the
crime
just
when
do
you
suppose
stella
was
pricked
i
asked
that
a
vital
consideration
just
now
i
do
not
know
the
poison
and
so
can
not
tell
how
quickly
it
acted
he
began
to
put
aside
his
various
paraphernalia
suppose
we
go
at
this
thing
by
a
process
of
deduction
rather
than
from
the
end
of
scientific
analysis
he
sat
on
a
corner
of
the
bench
what
do
we
find
he
began
while
i
been
working
here
with
the
test
tubes
and
the
microscope
i
been
trying
to
reconstruct
what
must
have
happened
trying
to
trace
out
every
action
of
stella
lamar
as
nearly
as
it
is
possible
for
us
to
do
so
i
do
think
we
need
to
go
back
of
their
arrival
at
the
house
for
the
present
they
seem
to
have
been
there
a
long
while
before
the
taking
of
the
particular
scene
since
there
were
twelve
other
scenes
preceding
and
since
it
requires
time
to
put
up
the
electric
lights
and
make
the
connections
as
well
as
to
set
the
cameras
take
tests
rearrange
the
furniture
and
all
the
rest
of
it
they
arrived
at
the
house
in
two
automobiles
with
the
exception
of
phelps
who
was
there
already
and
manton
who
came
in
his
own
limousine
that
means
that
miss
lamar
had
company
on
the
trip
out
the
principals
probably
riding
with
each
other
in
one
car
at
the
house
they
were
all
more
or
less
together
there
were
people
about
constantly
and
it
would
seem
as
if
there
was
small
opportunity
for
anyone
to
inflict
the
scratch
which
caused
her
death
i
do
mean
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
prick
her
i
mean
that
she
would
have
felt
the
jab
of
the
point
in
all
likelihood
she
would
have
cried
out
and
glanced
around
take
a
needle
yourself
sometime
walter
and
try
to
duplicate
the
scratch
on
your
own
arm
in
such
a
way
that
you
would
not
be
aware
of
it
so
you
see
i
counting
upon
some
sort
of
exclamation
from
miss
lamar
if
she
were
inoculated
with
the
poison
with
other
folks
about
it
is
sure
some
one
would
have
remembered
a
cry
a
questioning
glance
a
quick
grasp
of
the
forearm
for
the
nerves
are
very
sensitive
in
the
skin
there
no
one
did
recall
anything
of
the
kind
i
interrupted
it
is
from
that
fact
that
i
hope
to
deduce
something
now
let
follow
her
figuratively
to
her
little
dressing
room
this
was
a
part
of
the
living
room
where
the
rest
waited
it
is
not
a
certainty
but
yet
rather
a
sure
guess
that
if
she
had
received
a
scratch
behind
those
thin
silk
curtains
her
cry
would
have
been
heard
what
is
even
more
plausible
is
that
she
would
have
hurried
out
or
at
least
put
her
head
out
to
see
who
had
pricked
her
i
made
a
very
careful
examination
of
that
little
alcove
with
the
idea
that
some
artifice
might
have
been
used
it
occurred
to
me
that
a
poisoned
point
could
have
been
inserted
in
her
belongings
in
some
way
so
that
she
would
have
brought
about
her
own
death
directly
to
have
caught
herself
on
a
needle
point
in
her
bag
for
instance
would
not
have
impressed
her
to
the
point
of
making
a
disturbance
she
might
have
checked
her
exclamation
in
that
case
because
she
would
be
blaming
herself
but
i
found
nothing
in
her
things
nor
did
i
discover
anything
in
the
library
it
seems
to
me
therefore
that
we
must
look
for
a
direct
human
agency
a
thought
struck
me
and
i
hastened
to
suggest
it
could
some
device
have
been
arranged
in
her
clothes
craig
something
like
the
poison
rings
of
the
middle
ages
a
tiny
metal
thing
to
spring
open
and
expose
its
point
when
pressed
against
her
in
the
action
of
the
scenes
that
occurred
to
me
at
the
time
that
why
i
asked
mackay
to
send
all
her
clothes
down
here
every
stitch
and
rag
of
them
i
gone
over
everything
already
this
morning
not
only
have
i
examined
the
various
materials
for
stains
but
i
tested
each
hook
and
eye
and
button
and
pin
i
been
very
careful
to
cover
that
possibility
you
think
then
she
was
scratched
deliberately
by
some
one
during
the
taking
of
the
scenes
if
you
followed
my
line
of
reasoning
you
will
see
that
we
are
driven
to
that
assumption
perhaps
later
i
will
make
tests
on
a
given
number
of
girls
of
stella
general
age
and
type
and
temperament
to
show
that
they
will
cry
out
at
the
unexpected
prick
of
a
fine
needle
it
illogical
to
expect
that
a
cry
from
miss
lamar
even
an
exclamation
would
have
passed
unnoticed
except
during
the
excitement
of
actual
picture
taking
another
inspiration
came
to
me
but
i
was
almost
afraid
to
voice
it
it
seemed
a
daring
theory
could
death
have
resulted
from
poison
administered
in
some
other
fashion
by
something
she
had
eaten
for
instance
i
ventured
could
the
scratch
be
coincidental
kennedy
shook
his
head
there
the
value
of
our
chemical
analysis
and
scientific
tests
her
stomach
contents
showed
nothing
except
as
they
might
have
been
affected
by
her
weakened
condition
from
doctor
report
and
he
found
no
ordinary
symptoms
remember
and
from
my
own
observation
too
i
can
easily
prove
in
court
that
she
was
killed
by
the
mark
which
was
so
small
that
it
escaped
the
physician
altogether
i
turned
away
once
more
kennedy
reasoning
seemed
to
be
leading
into
a
maze
of
considerations
beyond
me
how
could
the
deductive
method
produce
results
in
a
case
as
mysterious
as
this
having
determined
that
miss
lamar
received
the
inoculation
during
the
making
of
one
of
the
scenes
as
nearly
as
we
can
do
so
kennedy
went
on
suppose
we
take
the
scenes
in
order
one
at
a
time
from
the
last
photographed
to
the
first
analyzing
each
in
turn
remember
that
we
seek
a
situation
where
there
is
not
only
an
opportunity
to
jab
her
with
a
needle
but
one
in
which
an
outcry
would
be
muffled
or
inaudible
i
now
saw
that
kennedy
had
brought
in
the
bound
script
of
the
story
the
black
terror
and
i
wondered
again
as
i
had
often
before
at
his
marvelous
capacity
for
attention
to
detail
spotlight
on
the
floor
reveals
the
girl
sobbing
over
the
body
of
the
millionaire
he
read
aloud
musingly
screams
and
cries
out
then
the
others
rush
in
for
several
moments
kennedy
paced
the
floor
of
the
laboratory
the
manuscript
open
in
his
hands
we
rehearsed
that
with
werner
and
we
questioned
everyone
too
and
remember
miss
lamar
instead
of
crying
out
as
she
was
supposed
to
do
just
crumpled
up
silently
so
thumbing
over
a
page
we
work
back
to
scene
twelve
she
she
was
not
in
that
at
all
scene
eleven
slowly
carefully
kennedy
went
through
each
scene
to
the
beginning
certainly
a
dramatic
opening
for
a
mystery
picture
he
remarked
suddenly
as
though
his
mind
had
wandered
from
his
problem
to
other
things
we
must
admit
that
millard
can
handle
a
scenario
most
beautifully
whether
it
was
professional
jealousy
or
the
thought
of
enid
rather
than
the
memory
of
my
own
poor
attempts
at
screen
writing
i
certainly
was
in
no
mood
to
agree
with
kennedy
for
all
that
i
knew
he
was
correct
here
he
thrust
the
binder
in
my
hands
read
that
first
scene
he
directed
meanwhile
i
am
going
to
phone
mackay
to
make
sure
he
has
had
the
house
guarded
and
to
make
double
sure
no
one
goes
near
the
library
we
going
out
to
tarrytown
again
walter
and
in
the
biggest
kind
of
hurry
what
the
idea
craig
kennedy
occasional
bursts
of
mysteriousness
characteristic
of
him
and
often
necessary
when
his
theories
were
only
half
formed
and
too
chaotic
for
explanations
always
piqued
me
he
did
not
seem
to
hear
already
he
was
at
the
telephone
manipulating
the
receiver
hook
impatiently
what
a
dummy
i
am
he
exclaimed
with
genuine
feeling
what
what
an
awful
dummy
knowing
i
would
get
nothing
out
of
him
just
yet
i
turned
to
the
scene
reading
as
he
told
me
at
first
i
could
not
see
where
the
detail
concerned
stella
lamar
in
any
way
then
i
came
to
the
description
of
her
introductory
entrance
the
initial
view
of
her
in
the
film
the
lines
of
typewriting
suddenly
stood
out
before
me
in
all
their
suggestive
clearness
the
spotlight
in
the
hands
of
a
shadowy
figure
roves
across
the
wall
and
to
the
portieres
as
it
pauses
there
the
portieres
move
and
the
fingers
of
a
girl
are
seen
on
the
edge
of
the
silk
a
bare
and
beautiful
arm
is
thrust
through
almost
to
the
shoulder
and
it
begins
to
move
the
portieres
aside
reaching
upward
to
pull
the
curtains
apart
at
the
rings
you
think
there
something
about
the
portieres
i
began
then
i
saw
that
kennedy
had
his
connection
that
something
disturbed
him
that
some
intelligence
from
the
other
end
had
caught
him
by
surprise
you
say
you
were
just
trying
to
get
me
mackay
you
something
to
tell
me
and
you
want
me
to
come
right
out
you
have
summoned
phelps
and
he
on
his
way
from
the
city
also
what
happened
i
asked
as
kennedy
hung
up
i
do
know
walter
mackay
said
he
did
want
to
talk
over
the
phone
and
that
we
had
just
time
to
catch
the
express
but
hurry
he
glanced
about
as
if
wondering
whether
any
of
his
scientific
instruments
would
help
him
xi
forestalled
on
the
train
kennedy
left
me
to
look
through
the
other
cars
having
the
idea
that
phelps
might
be
aboard
also
but
there
were
no
signs
of
the
banker
we
would
reach
tarrytown
first
unless
he
had
chosen
to
motor
out
mackay
was
waiting
at
the
station
to
meet
us
and
to
take
us
to
the
house
the
little
district
attorney
was
obviously
excited
was
the
place
guarded
well
last
night
asked
kennedy
almost
before
we
had
shaken
hands
yes
that
is
i
thought
it
was
that
what
i
want
to
tell
you
after
you
left
with
manton
and
werner
the
rest
of
the
company
packed
up
and
pulled
out
in
the
two
studio
cars
i
was
a
little
in
doubt
what
to
do
about
phelps
but
he
settled
it
himself
by
announcing
that
he
was
going
to
town
the
coroner
came
and
issued
the
permit
to
remove
the
body
and
that
was
taken
away
i
think
the
house
and
the
presence
of
the
dead
girl
and
all
the
rest
of
it
got
on
phelps
nerves
because
he
was
irritable
and
impatient
unwilling
to
wait
for
his
own
car
until
finally
i
drove
him
to
the
station
myself
was
anyone
any
of
those
on
our
list
of
possible
suspects
at
least
alone
in
the
room
or
in
the
house
not
while
i
was
there
mackay
replied
i
took
good
care
of
that
then
when
everyone
was
gone
and
while
phelps
was
waiting
for
me
i
detailed
two
of
my
deputies
to
stay
on
guard
one
inside
and
one
outside
for
the
night
i
thought
it
sufficient
precaution
since
you
had
made
your
preliminary
examination
and
kennedy
nodded
seeking
to
hurry
the
explanation
and
yet
added
mackay
some
one
entered
the
house
last
night
in
spite
of
us
kennedy
fairly
swore
under
his
breath
he
seemed
to
blame
himself
for
some
omission
in
his
investigation
the
previous
afternoon
how
did
it
happen
i
asked
rather
excitedly
it
was
about
three
the
guards
tell
me
the
man
inside
was
dozing
in
a
chair
before
the
fireplace
he
was
placed
so
he
could
command
a
view
of
the
doorway
to
the
library
as
well
as
the
stairs
and
reception
hall
all
at
once
he
was
awakened
by
a
shot
and
a
cry
from
outside
he
jumped
up
and
ran
toward
the
library
as
he
did
so
the
portieres
bellied
in
toward
him
as
if
in
stiff
sudden
draught
or
as
if
some
one
had
darted
into
their
folds
quickly
then
out
with
no
hesitation
he
drew
his
own
weapon
rushing
the
curtains
there
was
no
one
secreted
about
them
then
with
the
revolver
in
one
hand
he
switched
on
the
lights
the
room
was
empty
but
one
pair
of
french
windows
at
the
farther
end
were
wide
open
and
it
was
that
which
had
caused
the
current
of
air
he
ran
over
and
found
the
lock
had
been
forced
it
was
not
even
an
artistic
job
of
jimmying
what
about
the
deputy
posted
outside
prompted
kennedy
that
the
strange
part
of
it
he
was
alert
enough
but
it
a
big
house
to
watch
he
swears
that
the
first
thing
he
knew
of
any
trouble
was
the
sharp
metallic
click
which
he
realized
later
was
the
sound
made
by
the
intruder
in
forcing
the
catch
of
the
french
window
it
was
pretty
loud
out
in
the
quiet
of
a
tarrytown
night
he
started
around
from
the
rear
and
then
the
next
thing
he
caught
was
the
outline
of
a
shadowy
slinking
figure
as
a
man
dropped
out
of
the
library
he
called
the
intruder
broke
into
a
run
darting
across
the
open
space
of
lawn
and
crashing
through
the
shrubbery
without
any
further
effort
at
concealment
my
man
called
again
and
began
to
chase
the
stranger
finally
firing
and
missing
in
the
shrubbery
a
sharp
branch
whipped
him
under
the
chin
just
as
he
obtained
a
clear
view
of
the
outlined
figure
of
his
quarry
and
as
he
raised
his
weapon
to
shoot
again
the
revolver
was
knocked
from
his
hand
and
he
was
thrown
back
falling
to
the
ground
and
momentarily
stunned
whoever
broke
into
the
library
got
away
of
course
what
did
the
intruder
look
like
there
was
an
eagerness
in
manner
i
grasped
that
the
case
was
beginning
to
clarify
itself
in
his
mind
mackay
shook
his
head
there
was
no
moon
you
know
and
everything
happened
swiftly
but
was
he
tall
or
short
or
slender
or
stout
the
deputy
must
have
got
some
vague
idea
of
him
at
least
it
was
one
of
my
amateur
deputies
mackay
admitted
reluctantly
he
thought
the
man
was
hatless
but
could
even
be
sure
of
that
were
there
footprints
or
fingerprints
no
kennedy
we
out
of
luck
again
when
he
jumped
out
he
fell
to
his
hands
and
knees
in
a
garden
bed
the
foot
marks
were
ruined
because
his
feet
slid
and
simply
made
two
irregular
gashes
the
marks
of
his
hands
indicated
to
me
anyhow
that
he
wore
heavy
gloves
rubber
probably
any
disturbance
in
the
library
not
that
i
could
notice
that
why
i
phoned
you
at
once
i
hoping
you
discover
something
well
kennedy
sighed
it
was
a
wonderful
opportunity
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
i
have
told
you
all
yet
kennedy
mackay
went
on
there
was
a
second
man
and
a
second
man
kennedy
straightened
distinctly
surprised
i
would
swear
this
whole
thing
was
a
job
they
were
together
the
district
attorney
explained
that
why
i
did
mention
them
both
at
once
but
my
deputy
says
that
when
he
was
thrown
by
the
lash
of
the
branch
he
was
unable
to
move
for
a
few
seconds
on
account
of
the
nerve
shock
i
suppose
and
that
while
he
was
motionless
squatted
in
a
sort
of
sitting
position
with
hands
braced
behind
him
just
as
he
fell
he
was
aware
of
a
second
stranger
concealed
in
the
shrubbery
the
second
fellow
was
watching
the
first
without
the
question
of
a
doubt
while
the
deputy
slowly
rose
to
his
feet
this
other
chap
started
to
follow
the
man
who
had
broken
into
the
house
but
at
that
moment
there
was
the
sudden
sound
of
a
in
a
car
then
the
purr
of
a
motor
and
the
clatter
of
gears
number
one
spun
off
in
the
darkness
of
the
road
as
pretty
as
you
please
number
two
grunted
in
plain
disgust
by
this
time
my
deputy
had
his
wind
his
revolver
was
gone
but
he
jumped
the
second
stranger
with
little
enough
hesitation
and
they
battled
royally
for
several
minutes
in
the
dark
unfortunately
it
was
an
unequal
match
the
intruder
apparently
was
a
stocky
man
built
with
the
strength
of
a
battleship
he
got
away
also
without
leaving
anything
behind
him
to
serve
for
identification
you
have
no
more
description
than
of
the
first
man
unfortunately
not
medium
height
a
little
inclined
to
be
stocky
strong
as
a
longshoreman
that
all
are
you
sure
your
deputy
is
romancing
positively
he
the
son
of
one
of
our
best
families
here
a
sportsman
and
an
athlete
i
knew
he
loved
a
lark
or
a
chance
for
adventure
and
so
i
impressed
him
and
a
companion
as
deputies
when
i
met
them
on
the
street
on
my
way
up
to
phelps
house
just
after
the
tragedy
kennedy
lapsed
into
thought
who
could
the
watcher
have
been
who
was
interested
in
this
case
other
than
the
proper
authorities
apparently
some
one
knew
more
than
mackay
more
than
kennedy
whoever
it
was
had
made
no
effort
to
communicate
with
any
of
us
this
was
a
new
angle
to
the
mystery
a
mystery
which
became
deeper
as
we
progressed
at
the
house
kennedy
first
made
a
careful
tour
of
the
exterior
but
found
nothing
mackay
had
doubled
his
guards
and
had
sent
servants
away
so
that
there
could
be
no
interference
once
inside
i
noticed
that
kennedy
seemed
indisposed
to
make
another
minute
search
of
the
library
he
went
over
the
frame
of
the
french
window
with
his
lens
carefully
for
fingerprints
finding
nothing
he
went
back
directly
to
the
portieres
for
several
moments
he
stood
regarding
them
in
thought
then
he
began
a
most
painstaking
inspection
of
the
cloth
with
the
pocket
glass
beginning
at
the
library
side
i
remembered
that
first
scene
in
the
manuscript
which
kennedy
had
insisted
i
read
i
recalled
the
suspicion
which
had
flashed
to
me
before
the
message
from
mackay
had
disturbed
both
kennedy
thoughts
and
mine
stella
lamar
had
thrust
her
bare
arm
through
this
curtain
a
needle
cleverly
concealed
in
the
folds
might
easily
have
inflicted
the
fatal
scratch
it
was
for
a
trace
of
the
poison
point
that
kennedy
searched
of
that
i
was
sure
knowing
his
methods
i
glanced
up
and
down
the
heavy
hanging
silk
looking
for
the
glint
of
fine
sharp
steel
as
kennedy
had
done
before
starting
his
inspection
with
the
glass
the
color
of
the
silk
a
beautiful
heavy
velour
was
a
strange
dark
tint
very
close
to
the
grained
of
the
woodwork
both
the
thickness
of
the
material
and
its
dull
shade
made
the
portieres
serve
ideally
for
the
purpose
assumed
now
both
by
kennedy
and
myself
a
tiny
needle
might
remain
secreted
within
their
folds
for
days
nothing
certainly
caught
my
naked
eye
at
last
a
little
exclamation
from
kennedy
showed
us
that
he
had
discovered
something
i
moved
closer
as
did
mackay
it
lucky
none
of
us
toyed
with
these
curtains
yesterday
he
remarked
with
a
slight
smile
of
gratification
there
might
have
been
more
than
one
lying
where
stella
lamar
lies
at
the
present
moment
with
wholesome
respect
neither
mackay
nor
myself
touched
the
silk
as
kennedy
pointed
there
were
two
small
holes
almost
microscopic
in
the
material
about
the
one
there
was
the
slightest
discoloration
not
a
fraction
of
an
inch
away
i
saw
two
infinitesimal
spots
of
a
dark
tinge
what
does
it
mean
i
asked
although
i
could
guess
the
dark
spots
are
blood
the
discoloration
the
poison
from
the
needle
and
the
needle
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
that
where
our
very
scientific
culprit
has
forestalled
me
walter
the
needle
was
in
these
curtains
all
day
yesterday
unfortunately
i
did
not
study
the
manuscript
did
not
attach
any
importance
to
miss
lamar
scene
at
the
portieres
the
man
who
broke
in
last
night
removed
the
needle
but
almost
amused
not
the
traces
of
it
you
see
walter
after
all
the
scientific
detective
can
not
be
forestalled
even
by
the
most
scientific
criminal
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
which
does
not
leave
its
unmistakable
mark
behind
provided
you
can
read
it
the
hole
in
the
cloth
serves
me
quite
as
well
as
the
needle
itself
very
suddenly
a
voice
from
behind
us
interrupted
find
something
i
turned
startled
to
see
emery
phelps
there
was
a
distinct
eagerness
in
the
banker
expression
yes
kennedy
faced
him
undisturbed
apparently
not
surprised
his
scrutiny
of
phelps
face
was
frank
and
searching
yes
he
repeated
bit
by
bit
the
guilty
man
is
revealing
himself
to
us
xii
emery
phelps
there
there
is
something
the
matter
with
the
curtains
phelps
suggested
kennedy
pointed
to
the
two
holes
and
the
spots
miss
lamar
met
her
death
from
poison
introduced
into
her
system
through
a
tiny
scratch
from
a
prepared
needle
yes
phelps
was
calm
now
and
cool
i
wondered
if
it
were
pretense
on
his
part
what
have
these
little
marks
to
do
with
that
do
you
see
rejoined
kennedy
if
some
one
had
come
here
before
the
scene
in
the
picture
was
played
had
thrust
a
small
needle
perhaps
a
hollow
needle
from
a
hypodermic
syringe
through
the
heavy
thickness
of
this
silk
thrust
it
in
here
the
point
sticking
out
here
well
there
would
be
two
holes
left
where
the
threads
were
forced
apart
like
this
kennedy
took
his
stickpin
demonstrating
how
could
that
cause
stella
death
phelps
at
first
quite
upset
apparently
by
kennedy
discovery
now
was
lapsing
again
into
his
hostile
mood
his
question
was
cynical
try
to
recall
miss
lamar
actions
kennedy
went
on
patiently
what
was
she
supposed
to
do
in
the
very
first
scene
portieres
move
and
the
fingers
of
a
girl
are
seen
on
the
edge
of
the
silk
a
bare
and
beautiful
arm
is
thrust
through
almost
to
the
shoulder
and
it
begins
to
move
the
portieres
aside
reaching
upward
to
pull
the
curtains
apart
at
the
rings
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
phelps
eyes
were
very
wide
as
he
paused
grasping
the
scheme
and
yet
disbelieving
unless
it
all
were
a
bit
of
fine
acting
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
it
is
possible
to
calculate
a
thing
like
that
how
would
anyone
know
where
her
arm
would
be
it
is
simpler
than
it
sounds
mr
phelps
kennedy
was
suddenly
harsh
there
is
only
one
natural
movement
of
an
arm
in
that
case
the
culprit
was
undoubtedly
familiar
with
miss
lamar
height
and
with
her
manner
of
working
it
is
a
bit
of
action
which
has
to
be
repeated
in
both
the
long
shot
and
scenes
jameson
here
can
tell
you
how
many
times
a
scene
is
rehearsed
there
probably
were
a
dozen
sure
chances
of
the
needle
striking
the
girl
bare
flesh
you
will
see
from
the
position
of
the
holes
that
it
was
arranged
point
downward
and
slightly
turned
in
and
on
a
particular
fold
of
the
curtain
too
showing
that
some
one
placed
it
there
only
after
a
nice
bit
of
calculation
furthermore
it
was
high
enough
so
that
there
was
little
chance
of
anyone
being
pricked
except
the
star
whose
death
was
intended
phelps
either
seemed
convinced
or
else
he
felt
it
inadvisable
to
irritate
kennedy
by
a
further
pretense
of
skepticism
a
point
occurred
to
me
however
listen
craig
i
spoke
in
a
low
voice
remember
all
the
emphasis
you
placed
upon
the
fact
that
she
would
cry
out
she
was
not
supposed
to
cry
out
in
that
first
scene
no
walter
but
if
you
read
the
second
the
you
see
that
the
script
actually
calls
for
a
cry
now
suppose
she
makes
an
exclamation
in
the
first
instead
nobody
would
think
anything
of
it
they
would
assume
that
she
had
played
her
action
a
little
in
advance
perhaps
and
then
consider
this
too
miss
lamar
receiving
the
scratch
would
cry
out
unquestionably
but
she
has
been
before
the
camera
for
years
and
she
is
trained
in
the
idea
that
film
must
not
be
wasted
uselessly
she
would
not
interrupt
her
action
for
a
little
scratch
because
in
these
circumstances
any
little
startled
movement
would
fit
in
with
the
action
by
the
time
the
scene
was
over
she
would
have
forgotten
the
incident
it
would
mean
very
little
to
her
in
the
preoccupation
of
bringing
the
mythical
stella
remsen
into
existence
the
poison
however
would
be
putting
in
its
deadly
work
would
it
act
before
the
thirteenth
scene
i
began
not
necessarily
as
a
matter
of
fact
an
actress
in
the
excitement
of
her
work
might
resist
the
effects
for
a
much
longer
period
than
some
one
who
realizes
he
is
sick
some
day
i
going
to
write
a
book
on
that
i
going
to
collect
hundreds
of
examples
of
people
who
keep
plugging
along
because
they
refuse
to
admit
anything
the
matter
with
them
it
like
napoleon
courier
who
did
drop
until
he
delivered
his
message
and
made
his
last
precise
military
salute
one
other
thought
struck
me
the
blood
spots
on
the
curtain
can
not
be
miss
lamar
if
as
you
say
the
scratch
brought
no
blood
how
about
the
nocturnal
visitor
who
removed
the
needle
in
the
dark
ca
you
imagine
him
pricking
himself
beautifully
in
his
hurry
good
heavens
i
felt
the
chills
travel
up
and
down
my
spine
there
may
be
another
fatality
then
i
exclaimed
kennedy
was
noncommittal
it
would
be
too
bad
for
justice
to
be
cheated
in
that
fashion
he
remarked
phelps
meanwhile
had
been
listening
to
us
impatiently
finally
he
turned
to
mackay
was
that
all
you
called
me
out
here
for
did
you
just
want
to
show
me
the
pinholes
in
those
portieres
not
exactly
mackay
replied
eyeing
him
sharply
some
one
forced
his
way
into
this
library
last
night
my
guard
saw
him
and
also
saw
a
second
man
who
remained
out
in
the
shrubbery
and
seemed
to
be
watching
the
first
one
shot
was
fired
but
both
men
got
away
an
automobile
was
waiting
perhaps
two
of
them
how
does
this
concern
me
phelps
voice
rose
in
anger
he
strode
into
the
library
and
over
to
the
french
windows
inspecting
the
damage
to
the
fine
woodwork
with
steadily
rising
color
then
he
hurried
back
to
the
side
of
mackay
it
up
to
you
mackay
he
said
with
a
great
show
of
his
ill
feeling
you
practically
forced
me
out
of
my
own
house
you
sent
my
servants
away
you
put
your
own
guards
in
charge
young
inexperienced
deputies
who
do
know
enough
to
come
in
when
it
wet
now
you
have
me
make
this
trip
out
here
in
business
hours
just
to
show
me
where
a
needle
has
been
stuck
in
a
curtain
and
where
a
pair
of
imported
window
sashes
have
been
ruined
mackay
was
unruffled
it
is
necessary
phelps
that
you
look
over
this
room
and
see
that
nothing
else
has
been
disturbed
that
there
is
no
further
damage
moreover
i
thought
you
might
be
interested
might
wish
to
help
us
determine
the
identity
of
the
intruder
if
there
any
way
i
can
really
help
you
to
do
that
sarcastically
i
be
delighted
were
you
here
the
night
before
the
murder
mackay
asked
you
know
i
seldom
spend
the
night
in
tarrytown
i
have
quarters
in
new
york
at
the
club
and
recently
i
have
been
spending
all
my
time
in
new
york
on
account
of
the
situation
in
the
picture
business
you
were
not
here
the
night
before
the
murder
then
no
but
you
were
out
here
yesterday
before
the
actors
arrived
before
manton
or
any
of
his
technical
staff
and
crew
came
i
was
out
very
early
to
make
sure
the
servants
had
the
house
ready
phelps
was
red
now
are
you
insinuating
anything
mackay
the
little
district
attorney
was
demonstrating
a
certain
quality
of
dogged
perseverance
some
one
put
the
needle
in
the
curtain
before
the
company
arrived
you
probably
were
in
the
house
at
the
time
or
at
the
least
your
servants
were
whoever
did
was
the
one
who
murdered
stella
lamar
and
also
rejoined
phelps
tartly
was
the
intruder
who
broke
in
here
last
night
and
ruined
my
window
sash
if
you
had
had
better
guards
you
might
have
caught
him
too
are
you
sure
of
your
servants
are
they
reliable
i
never
anticipated
a
murder
and
so
i
did
question
them
as
to
their
poisoning
proclivities
when
i
engaged
them
but
you
know
where
they
are
and
you
can
examine
them
if
i
were
you
mackay
gentlemen
kennedy
hastened
to
stop
the
colloquy
before
it
became
an
quarrel
then
he
faced
the
banker
phelps
kennedy
voice
was
soft
coaxing
i
do
think
mackay
quite
understands
it
would
be
a
great
service
to
me
if
you
would
give
the
house
a
quick
general
inspection
you
are
familiar
with
the
things
here
enough
to
state
whether
they
have
been
disturbed
to
any
appreciable
degree
you
see
we
do
not
know
the
interior
arrangements
as
they
were
before
this
unfortunate
happening
with
rather
ill
grace
phelps
stalked
up
the
steps
acceding
to
kennedy
request
but
disdaining
to
answer
kennedy
turned
to
mackay
as
the
banker
disappeared
out
of
earshot
that
just
to
cool
him
off
a
bit
i
have
everything
i
came
to
get
right
here
producing
a
pair
of
pocket
scissors
he
cut
the
pierced
and
spotted
bit
of
silk
from
the
portieres
ruthlessly
it
was
necessary
vandalism
what
was
the
poison
mr
kennedy
mackay
asked
in
a
low
voice
i
think
that
it
was
closely
allied
to
the
cyanide
groups
in
its
rapacious
activity
but
you
have
identified
it
yet
no
so
far
i
have
the
slightest
idea
of
its
true
nature
it
seems
to
have
a
powerful
affinity
for
important
nerve
centers
of
respiration
and
muscular
as
well
as
possessing
a
tendency
to
disorganize
the
blood
i
should
say
that
it
produces
death
by
respiratory
paralysis
and
convulsions
to
my
mind
it
is
an
exact
though
perhaps
less
active
counterpart
of
hydrocyanic
acid
but
that
is
not
what
it
is
or
i
would
have
been
able
to
prove
it
before
this
mackay
nodded
listening
in
silence
you
say
nothing
of
this
kennedy
added
i
be
silent
of
course
heavy
footsteps
from
the
rear
marked
the
return
of
phelps
who
had
covered
the
upper
floors
descending
by
the
back
stairs
so
as
to
have
a
look
at
the
kitchen
everything
seems
to
be
all
right
he
remarked
half
graciously
kennedy
led
the
way
to
the
front
porch
there
he
seemed
more
interested
in
the
weather
than
in
the
case
for
he
studied
the
sky
intently
glancing
up
i
saw
that
the
morning
was
still
gray
and
cloudy
with
no
promise
that
the
sun
would
be
able
to
struggle
through
the
overhanging
moisture
i
do
think
we
go
back
to
the
city
that
is
all
the
way
in
he
remarked
speaking
for
both
of
us
i
want
to
go
to
the
manton
studio
first
this
is
no
day
for
exteriors
and
so
they
probably
be
working
there
he
smiled
at
phelps
i
want
to
see
if
any
of
our
possible
suspects
look
as
though
they
had
been
engaging
in
nocturnal
journeys
phelps
had
been
rubbing
his
eyes
he
dropped
his
hand
so
quickly
that
i
wanted
to
smile
then
to
cover
his
confusion
he
promptly
offered
to
drive
us
in
mackay
at
the
same
time
volunteered
his
car
kennedy
accepted
the
latter
offer
as
he
thanked
the
banker
i
wondered
if
any
suspicion
of
that
individual
lurked
in
the
back
of
his
mind
phelps
certainly
had
made
a
very
bad
impression
upon
me
with
his
antagonistic
attitude
with
his
readiness
to
transform
every
question
into
a
personal
affront
just
one
other
thing
phelps
exclaimed
kennedy
as
we
were
about
to
descend
to
mackay
car
why
did
you
wish
the
scenes
in
black
terror
actually
taken
in
your
library
kennedy
had
asked
the
question
before
had
he
forgotten
i
glanced
at
the
banker
and
read
the
same
thought
in
his
expression
i
i
proud
of
my
library
and
i
wanted
to
see
it
in
pictures
he
replied
after
some
hesitation
and
with
a
little
rancor
not
to
save
money
it
would
be
no
appreciable
saving
i
see
kennedy
was
tantalizingly
deliberate
how
long
have
you
held
the
controlling
interest
in
manton
pictures
mr
phelps
uh
in
surprise
nearly
a
year
you
could
have
had
your
library
photographed
at
any
time
then
simply
by
stating
your
request
as
you
did
in
this
case
in
that
year
there
have
been
pictures
which
would
have
served
the
purpose
as
well
as
this
better
in
fact
because
in
this
picture
the
library
seems
to
be
dark
almost
altogether
in
other
stories
there
probably
were
infinitely
better
chances
for
the
exhibition
of
the
room
why
did
you
wait
for
black
terror
as
a
clear
understanding
of
kennedy
question
and
all
it
entailed
filtered
into
the
mind
of
phelps
he
became
so
red
and
flushed
with
anger
that
i
felt
sure
he
was
going
to
explode
on
the
spot
because
i
did
think
of
it
before
he
sputtered
you
said
the
situation
in
the
picture
business
made
it
necessary
for
you
to
stay
in
town
is
there
any
trouble
between
manton
and
yourself
not
a
bit
was
stella
lamar
making
any
trouble
of
a
business
nature
such
as
threatening
to
quit
manton
pictures
no
phelps
eyes
now
were
narrowed
to
slits
are
you
sure
with
a
great
effort
phelps
achieved
a
degree
of
he
forced
a
smile
his
remark
presumed
to
be
a
pleasantry
i
knew
masked
the
true
state
of
his
feelings
as
sure
kennedy
he
rejoined
awed
by
kennedy
reputation
even
in
the
full
flood
of
his
anger
as
sure
as
i
am
that
i
like
to
throw
you
down
these
steps
xiii
marilyn
loring
the
magic
of
manton
name
admitted
us
to
the
studio
courtyard
and
at
once
i
was
struck
by
the
change
since
the
day
before
now
the
tank
was
a
dry
empty
shallow
depression
of
concrete
the
scenery
all
the
paraphernalia
assembled
for
the
taking
of
water
stuff
was
gone
except
for
the
parked
automobiles
in
one
corner
and
a
few
loitering
figures
here
and
there
the
big
quadrangle
seemed
absolutely
deserted
in
the
general
reception
room
kennedy
asked
for
millard
but
was
told
he
had
not
been
out
since
the
previous
day
that
was
to
be
expected
but
manton
it
developed
was
away
also
he
had
telephoned
in
that
he
would
be
detained
until
late
afternoon
on
important
business
i
know
that
i
for
one
wondered
if
it
were
connected
with
fortune
features
it
just
as
well
kennedy
remarked
after
convincing
the
boy
at
the
desk
it
was
manton
wish
that
we
have
the
run
of
the
place
my
real
object
in
coming
was
to
watch
the
cast
at
work
we
found
our
way
to
the
small
studio
called
so
in
comparison
with
the
larger
one
where
the
huge
ballroom
and
banquet
sets
were
being
built
in
reality
it
possessed
a
tremendous
floor
space
now
all
the
other
companies
had
been
forced
to
make
room
for
the
black
terror
on
account
of
the
emergency
created
by
the
death
of
stella
lamar
and
there
were
any
number
of
sets
put
up
hastily
for
the
retakes
of
the
scenes
in
which
stella
had
appeared
the
effect
of
the
whole
upon
a
strange
beholder
was
weird
it
was
as
though
a
cyclone
had
swept
through
a
town
and
had
gathered
up
and
deposited
slices
and
corners
and
sections
of
rooms
and
hallways
and
upper
chambers
each
complete
with
furniture
and
ornaments
curtains
rugs
and
hangings
except
for
the
artistic
harmony
of
things
within
the
narrow
lines
of
the
view
nothing
in
this
great
place
had
any
apparent
relation
to
anything
else
some
of
the
sets
were
lighted
with
actors
and
technical
crews
at
work
others
were
dark
standing
ready
for
use
still
others
were
in
varying
states
of
construction
or
demolition
rising
above
every
other
impression
was
the
noise
it
was
pandemonium
we
saw
werner
at
work
in
a
distant
corner
and
strolled
over
the
director
was
bustling
about
feverishly
i
do
not
doubt
that
the
grim
necessity
of
preparing
the
picture
for
a
release
date
which
was
already
announced
had
resulted
in
this
haste
without
even
a
day
of
idleness
in
respect
for
the
memory
of
the
dead
star
yet
it
seemed
and
mercenary
to
me
i
thought
that
success
was
not
deserved
by
an
enterprise
so
callous
of
human
life
so
unappreciative
of
human
effort
most
of
the
cast
were
standing
about
waiting
the
scenes
were
being
taken
in
a
small
room
fitted
as
an
office
or
private
den
but
furnished
luxuriously
later
i
learned
it
was
in
the
home
of
the
millionaire
remsen
close
off
the
library
for
which
the
actual
room
in
phelps
home
was
photographed
shirley
and
gordon
i
noticed
kept
as
far
apart
as
possible
it
was
quite
intentional
and
i
again
caught
belligerent
glances
between
them
on
the
other
hand
both
enid
and
marilyn
loring
were
calm
and
yet
between
these
two
i
caught
a
coolness
a
sort
of
armed
truce
in
which
each
felt
it
would
be
a
sign
of
weakness
to
admit
consciously
even
the
near
presence
of
the
other
werner
was
irascible
swearing
roundly
at
the
slightest
provocation
raging
up
and
down
at
every
little
error
come
now
he
shouted
as
we
approached
let
get
this
scene
now
number
one
loring
gordon
shake
a
leg
here
read
it
again
enters
he
is
scarcely
seated
at
the
desk
examining
papers
when
zelda
enters
in
a
filmy
negligee
daring
looks
up
amazed
and
zelda
pretends
great
agitation
daring
is
not
unkind
to
her
he
tells
her
he
has
not
discovered
the
will
as
yet
spoken
title
i
am
sure
that
i
can
find
a
will
and
that
you
are
provided
for
continuing
scene
daring
speaks
the
above
zelda
thanks
him
and
undulates
toward
the
door
with
the
swaying
walk
of
the
vampire
daring
turns
to
his
papers
and
does
not
watch
her
further
she
looks
over
her
shoulder
then
exits
registering
that
she
will
get
him
yet
werner
dropped
his
copy
of
the
script
understand
he
barked
make
it
fast
now
we
should
do
this
over
but
you
were
lousy
before
both
of
you
gordon
extinguished
a
cigarette
and
entered
the
set
with
a
scowl
marilyn
rose
and
slipped
out
of
a
dressing
gown
spotted
with
and
dark
from
its
long
service
in
the
studios
underneath
the
wrapper
the
finest
of
silken
draperies
clung
to
her
infinitely
more
intimate
here
in
actuality
and
in
the
bright
studio
lights
than
it
would
be
upon
the
screen
i
noticed
the
slim
trimness
of
her
figure
could
not
help
myself
in
fact
and
i
saw
also
that
she
shrank
back
just
the
least
little
bit
before
stepping
to
her
place
at
the
door
it
was
modesty
a
genuine
girlish
diffidence
in
a
moment
i
revised
my
conception
of
her
before
i
had
not
been
able
to
decide
whether
marilyn
loring
was
a
woman
with
a
gift
for
looking
young
or
a
flapper
with
the
baffling
sophistication
affected
these
days
by
so
many
of
them
now
i
knew
somehow
that
she
was
just
all
girl
probably
in
her
early
twenties
the
brief
instant
of
shyness
had
betrayed
her
in
the
scene
she
changed
marilyn
loring
was
an
actress
the
moment
she
caught
the
click
of
the
camera
turn
there
was
a
hardness
about
her
mouth
a
faint
dishonest
touch
to
the
play
of
her
eye
a
shameless
boldness
to
her
movements
concealed
without
concealment
in
the
flash
of
a
second
she
was
marilyn
no
longer
but
zelda
the
ward
of
old
remsen
an
unscrupulous
and
willing
ally
of
the
black
terror
werner
damned
the
amount
of
footage
used
in
the
scene
then
turned
to
the
next
with
enid
and
gordon
in
the
same
set
one
of
the
necessary
retakes
for
which
the
room
had
been
put
up
again
enid
had
not
noticed
me
and
i
somehow
failed
to
shake
off
the
feeling
of
fear
that
the
glance
of
millard
had
given
me
faint
heart
i
was
and
the
answer
was
that
i
had
yet
to
win
the
fair
lady
to
excuse
myself
i
pretended
she
was
different
under
the
lights
it
was
really
true
that
as
zelda
remsen
enid
was
not
the
fascinating
creature
i
had
met
in
werner
office
there
was
too
much
mascaro
on
her
lashes
too
great
an
amount
of
red
and
blue
and
even
bright
yellow
in
her
in
striking
contrast
was
the
little
coloring
used
by
stella
lamar
or
even
marilyn
loring
enid
scene
was
a
in
which
the
beginning
of
the
love
interest
in
the
story
was
shown
i
noticed
that
as
the
cameras
turned
upon
the
action
the
girl
inch
by
inch
shifted
her
position
almost
imperceptibly
until
she
was
practically
facing
the
lens
the
consequence
was
that
gordon
playing
the
lover
was
forced
to
move
also
in
order
to
follow
her
face
and
so
was
brought
with
his
back
toward
the
camera
it
was
the
pleasant
little
film
trick
known
as
taking
the
picture
away
from
a
fellow
actor
enid
was
a
lens
hog
the
moment
the
scene
was
over
gordon
rushed
to
werner
to
protest
the
director
irritated
and
in
a
hurry
gave
him
small
satisfaction
both
players
were
called
back
under
the
lights
for
the
next
take
as
werner
back
was
turned
enid
favored
gordon
with
a
mischievous
malicious
glance
the
leading
man
possessed
very
few
friends
from
what
i
had
heard
the
new
star
evidently
did
not
propose
to
become
one
of
them
let
pay
our
respects
socially
suggested
kennedy
at
my
elbow
i
followed
his
glance
and
saw
that
marilyn
was
seated
alone
away
from
the
others
apparently
forlorn
as
we
approached
she
drew
her
dressing
robe
about
her
smiling
with
the
smile
her
face
lighted
it
was
in
the
rare
moments
just
as
her
smile
broke
and
spread
that
she
was
pretty
strikingly
so
professor
kennedy
she
exclaimed
and
jameson
too
sit
down
and
watch
our
new
star
what
do
you
think
of
her
kennedy
asked
enid
marilyn
expression
became
quizzical
i
think
she
a
clever
girl
you
mean
something
by
that
do
you
prompted
kennedy
she
sobered
no
honestly
for
an
instant
she
studied
him
with
a
directness
of
gaze
which
i
would
have
found
disconcerting
do
tell
me
she
teased
again
allowing
the
flash
of
a
smile
to
illuminate
her
features
do
tell
me
the
renowned
and
celebrated
professor
kennedy
suspects
enid
faye
of
murdering
poor
stella
to
get
her
position
kennedy
laughed
turning
to
me
there
the
woman
he
remarked
we
may
deduce
and
analyze
and
catalogue
all
the
facts
of
science
but
he
spread
his
palms
wide
expressly
it
is
as
nothing
against
a
intuition
facing
marilyn
again
he
became
frank
you
caught
my
thought
exactly
although
it
was
not
as
bad
as
all
that
i
simply
wondered
if
miss
faye
might
not
have
had
something
to
do
with
the
case
why
i
realized
now
that
this
miss
loring
in
addition
to
considerable
skill
as
an
actress
in
addition
to
rare
beauty
on
the
screen
possessed
a
brain
and
the
power
to
use
it
she
followed
kennedy
with
greater
ease
than
i
who
knew
him
why
she
repeated
perhaps
it
the
intuition
of
the
male
he
began
hesitatingly
she
shook
her
head
a
man
intuition
is
not
dependable
you
see
a
woman
gets
her
intuition
first
and
fits
her
facts
to
it
while
a
man
takes
a
fact
and
then
has
an
intuitive
burst
of
inspiration
as
a
result
the
woman
puts
her
facts
last
and
so
is
not
thrown
out
when
they
wrong
as
they
usually
are
but
the
man
i
think
professor
kennedy
that
you
have
some
facts
about
enid
stored
away
and
that
that
why
you
put
a
double
meaning
in
my
remark
am
i
right
he
smiled
i
surrender
miss
loring
you
are
right
what
is
the
little
fact
perhaps
i
can
help
you
miss
faye
and
lawrence
millard
seem
to
be
old
friends
oh
maybe
you
wonder
at
the
contents
of
the
sealed
testimony
in
the
case
of
millard
vs
millard
kennedy
nodded
do
you
want
to
know
what
i
think
she
asked
please
well
i
worked
with
stella
nearly
a
year
it
my
opinion
she
divorced
millard
because
he
asked
her
to
do
so
no
no
i
balked
at
that
interrupting
he
could
have
obtained
the
divorce
himself
if
he
had
wanted
it
stella
lamar
and
manton
that
talk
she
rejoined
with
a
show
of
feeling
that
the
thing
i
hate
about
pictures
it
always
talk
talk
talk
i
not
saying
stella
and
old
papa
lloyd
as
we
used
to
call
him
never
were
mixed
up
with
each
other
but
it
one
thing
to
repeat
a
bit
of
gossip
and
quite
another
thing
to
prove
it
i
not
one
to
help
give
currency
to
any
rumor
of
immoral
relationship
until
i
pretty
sure
it
true
you
think
miss
lamar
was
as
bad
as
painted
asked
kennedy
i
sure
of
it
kennedy
i
known
stella
and
i
known
others
of
her
type
fundamentally
they
the
kindest
truest
people
on
earth
when
stella
and
i
shared
a
dressing
room
i
often
caught
her
giving
away
this
or
that
frequently
things
she
needed
herself
i
known
her
to
draw
against
her
salary
to
lend
money
to
some
actor
or
actress
whom
she
well
knew
would
never
repay
her
stella
biggest
fault
was
an
overbalancing
quality
of
sympathy
if
she
ever
did
get
mixed
up
with
anyone
you
may
bet
it
was
because
that
person
played
upon
her
feelings
have
you
any
theory
as
to
who
killed
her
it
was
a
direct
question
no
the
answer
was
quick
but
then
an
amazing
thing
happened
marilyn
suddenly
colored
a
flush
which
gathered
up
around
her
eyes
above
the
and
made
me
think
of
a
country
girl
she
started
to
say
something
else
and
then
bit
her
tongue
her
confusion
was
surprising
due
probably
to
the
unexpectedness
of
kennedy
query
kennedy
seemed
to
wish
to
spare
her
undoubtedly
her
prompt
negative
had
been
the
truth
some
afterthought
had
robbed
her
of
her
tell
me
why
you
said
miss
faye
was
a
clever
girl
he
directed
just
because
she
puts
her
ambition
above
everything
else
and
works
hard
and
honestly
and
sincerely
and
will
get
there
that
what
people
call
being
clever
i
see
werner
voice
roaring
through
a
megaphone
announced
an
interval
for
lunch
marilyn
rose
laughing
now
but
still
in
a
high
color
conscious
perhaps
that
she
had
revealed
some
strong
undercurrent
of
feeling
if
you
escort
me
to
my
dressing
room
she
said
coaxingly
and
wait
until
i
slip
into
a
skirt
and
waist
i
initiate
both
of
you
to
mccann
across
the
street
we
all
eat
there
players
stage
hands
chauffeurs
all
but
the
stars
who
have
machines
to
take
them
elsewhere
kennedy
glanced
at
me
delighted
said
i
we
have
much
time
she
went
on
leading
the
way
werner
on
a
rampage
he
is
usually
that
way
it
stella
death
i
guess
she
opened
one
of
the
steel
fire
doors
he
always
that
way
though
when
he
been
out
the
night
before
i
flashed
a
look
at
kennedy
could
werner
have
been
at
tarrytown
in
the
long
hallway
of
dressing
rooms
marilyn
stopped
grasping
the
knob
of
her
door
it
only
take
me
she
began
then
her
face
went
white
as
the
concrete
of
the
floor
and
that
was
immaculate
an
expression
which
might
have
been
fear
or
horror
or
hate
or
all
three
spread
over
her
features
transforming
her
following
the
direction
of
her
stare
i
saw
shirley
down
the
hall
just
as
he
stopped
at
his
own
door
he
caught
her
glance
suddenly
and
his
own
face
went
red
i
thought
that
his
hands
trembled
marilyn
wheeled
about
lips
pressed
tightly
together
throwing
open
the
door
she
dashed
into
her
room
slamming
it
with
a
bang
which
echoed
and
up
and
down
the
little
hall
she
had
forgotten
our
presence
altogether
xiv
another
clue
kennedy
looked
at
me
quizzically
i
guess
we
better
not
wait
for
miss
loring
to
initiate
us
to
mccann
he
remarked
we
found
our
way
to
the
courtyard
and
were
headed
for
the
gate
when
a
young
man
in
chauffeur
cap
and
uniform
intercepted
us
i
had
noticed
him
start
forward
from
one
of
the
cars
parked
in
the
inclosure
but
did
not
recognize
him
may
i
speak
to
you
a
moment
professor
kennedy
alone
jameson
here
is
associated
with
me
is
assisting
me
in
this
case
if
it
is
something
concerning
the
death
of
miss
lamar
it
is
sir
i
saw
you
out
at
tarrytown
yesterday
mcgroarty
is
my
name
and
i
drove
one
of
the
cars
the
company
went
in
they
were
pointing
you
out
to
me
and
i
read
about
you
and
just
now
i
says
to
myself
there
something
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
right
kennedy
lighted
a
cigar
offering
one
to
the
chauffeur
i
not
supernatural
and
often
i
able
to
solve
a
mystery
only
with
the
help
of
all
those
who
like
myself
want
justice
done
yes
sir
that
my
way
of
looking
at
it
well
mcgroarty
blew
a
cloud
of
smoke
appreciatively
i
do
a
good
bit
of
driving
for
these
people
and
this
morning
it
was
cloudy
and
dull
no
good
for
exteriors
but
yet
sort
of
so
it
might
clear
at
any
moment
and
so
i
was
ordered
i
brought
my
car
and
left
it
standing
here
in
the
yard
while
i
went
over
to
mccann
the
lunch
room
you
know
for
a
cup
of
coffee
when
i
came
back
again
the
cigar
there
still
was
nothing
doing
and
so
i
thought
you
know
how
it
is
i
thought
i
clean
up
the
back
of
the
old
boat
to
kill
time
not
saying
it
was
needed
so
i
took
out
the
cocoa
mat
to
beat
it
and
what
do
i
find
on
the
floor
between
the
mat
and
the
rear
seat
it
was
i
guess
but
this
he
handed
kennedy
some
small
object
which
glinted
in
the
light
looking
closely
i
saw
that
it
was
a
peculiarly
shaped
little
glass
tube
an
ampulla
kennedy
explained
it
the
technical
name
the
doctors
have
for
such
a
container
it
must
have
been
between
the
mat
and
the
rear
seat
the
chauffeur
repeated
then
he
discovered
that
his
cigar
was
out
he
struck
a
match
kennedy
turned
the
bit
of
glass
over
and
over
in
his
hand
examining
it
carefully
i
felt
rather
fearful
wondering
if
it
might
not
contain
some
trace
of
the
deadly
poison
which
had
so
quickly
killed
stella
lamar
i
even
half
expected
to
see
kennedy
find
some
infinitesimal
jagged
edge
or
point
which
could
have
inflicted
the
fatal
scratch
then
i
realized
that
mcgroarty
had
handled
the
thing
with
impunity
perhaps
had
carried
it
about
half
a
day
kennedy
took
his
scarf
pin
on
the
outside
of
the
little
tube
there
was
no
trace
of
a
label
or
marking
of
any
sort
all
about
on
the
inside
however
the
glass
was
spotted
with
dried
incrustations
resembling
crystals
and
at
first
apt
to
escape
even
the
sharpest
scrutiny
with
the
pin
kennedy
scaled
off
one
of
these
and
put
it
under
his
pocket
lens
but
he
came
to
no
conclusion
rather
puzzled
and
nettled
he
dropped
the
tiny
bit
of
substance
back
into
the
tube
then
replaced
his
pin
in
his
scarf
and
stowed
this
latest
bit
of
possible
evidence
in
his
pocket
carefully
how
do
you
suppose
it
got
in
the
car
he
asked
some
one
must
have
dropped
it
and
it
must
have
rolled
in
that
space
by
the
edge
of
the
mat
replied
the
chauffeur
there
was
just
room
for
it
too
i
never
would
have
noticed
it
without
taking
up
the
mat
it
could
be
broken
by
being
trampled
on
nope
not
a
chance
how
long
could
it
have
been
there
two
or
three
or
four
days
since
i
cleaned
up
last
i
remembered
the
cleverness
shown
by
the
guilty
person
in
placing
the
needle
in
the
curtain
it
seemed
unlikely
that
this
could
be
an
accident
is
it
possible
i
suggested
that
this
is
a
plant
that
the
tube
was
put
there
deliberately
to
throw
us
off
the
track
it
quite
likely
he
admitted
on
the
other
hand
walter
the
very
smartest
criminal
will
do
some
foolish
little
thing
enough
to
ruin
the
most
careful
plans
and
preparations
he
turned
to
mcgroarty
who
rode
in
your
car
yesterday
mine
the
principals
car
boasted
mcgroarty
going
out
i
had
miss
lamar
miss
loring
gordon
shirley
and
werner
coming
back
werner
was
with
you
and
miss
lamar
well
there
was
only
miss
loring
and
gordon
and
mr
shirley
did
you
notice
how
they
acted
they
never
says
a
word
to
each
other
on
all
the
trip
back
but
i
did
think
it
strange
after
what
happened
although
usually
always
joking
and
laughing
you
brought
the
three
to
the
studio
here
yes
they
had
to
get
out
of
did
you
leave
the
car
then
no
i
hit
it
right
for
the
garage
were
you
away
from
the
car
at
tarrytown
sure
that
was
a
long
wait
peters
manton
chauffeur
and
i
found
a
couple
of
horseshoes
and
we
were
throwing
them
most
of
the
time
how
long
was
the
machine
alone
here
in
the
yard
this
morning
a
couple
of
hours
maybe
i
knew
the
old
boiler
was
safe
enough
and
that
if
they
wanted
me
they
look
over
in
mccann
well
kennedy
extended
his
hand
i
thank
you
and
i
wo
forget
you
mcgroarty
as
soon
as
the
chauffeur
was
out
of
earshot
i
faced
kennedy
rather
eagerly
to
forestall
him
if
he
had
arrived
at
the
same
conclusion
as
myself
see
it
just
as
i
thought
yesterday
how
that
walter
werner
he
rode
out
in
that
machine
but
not
back
in
manton
car
he
was
worried
all
the
time
he
probably
knew
he
had
dropped
the
tube
then
he
hurried
up
ahead
of
us
and
wiped
the
needle
i
stopped
lamely
kennedy
smiled
see
you
jumping
at
conclusions
too
fast
you
remember
now
that
we
decided
that
the
towel
has
nothing
directly
to
do
with
the
poison
in
a
way
you
can
not
assume
that
this
ampulla
has
either
although
i
myself
feel
sure
on
that
point
but
in
any
case
no
one
is
eliminated
it
is
true
werner
did
not
return
in
the
same
automobile
it
is
also
true
that
he
had
little
opportunity
to
drop
it
while
others
were
in
the
car
with
him
when
mcgroarty
was
away
from
the
car
anyone
could
have
lost
it
or
as
you
suggested
a
moment
ago
planted
it
there
deliberately
to
divert
suspicion
i
felt
the
beginnings
of
a
headache
from
all
these
confused
threads
of
the
mystery
ca
is
there
anyone
we
can
say
is
innocent
at
least
even
if
we
can
not
begin
to
fasten
the
guilt
upon
somebody
i
pleaded
kennedy
shook
his
head
at
this
stage
the
one
is
as
hard
as
the
other
i
consider
myself
lucky
to
have
collected
as
much
material
as
i
have
for
the
analysis
of
the
poison
he
tapped
his
pocket
significantly
a
frankly
shrill
call
in
a
feminine
voice
interrupted
we
both
turned
to
see
marilyn
loring
hastening
toward
us
did
you
think
i
was
going
to
forget
you
she
asked
almost
reproachfully
and
much
out
of
breath
let
hurry
she
added
this
is
roast
beef
day
we
started
toward
the
gate
once
more
marilyn
between
us
vivacious
and
rather
charming
i
noticed
that
she
made
no
reference
to
the
incident
in
the
hallway
the
precipitate
manner
in
which
she
left
us
and
the
very
evident
confusion
of
merle
shirley
kennedy
too
seemed
disposed
to
drop
the
matter
although
it
was
obviously
significant
for
some
reason
his
mind
was
elsewhere
so
that
the
girl
was
thrown
upon
my
hands
it
struck
me
that
after
all
she
was
attractive
at
this
moment
i
found
her
distinctly
why
do
you
i
asked
innocently
you
do
seem
to
me
if
you
pardon
the
personal
remark
at
all
that
type
she
laughed
it
all
the
fault
of
the
public
they
insist
that
i
vamp
i
want
to
play
parts
but
the
public
wo
stand
for
it
they
wo
come
to
see
the
picture
they
tell
the
exhibitor
and
he
tells
the
producer
and
back
i
am
at
the
vamping
again
is
it
funny
she
paused
a
moment
take
gordon
does
it
make
you
laugh
what
the
public
think
he
is
hero
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
little
do
they
know
all
at
once
kennedy
stopped
abruptly
we
were
close
to
the
entrance
just
where
a
smart
little
speedster
of
light
blue
lined
with
white
was
parked
at
the
edge
of
the
narrow
sidewalk
the
sun
after
a
morning
of
uncertainty
had
just
struck
through
the
haze
and
it
illuminated
marilyn
face
and
hair
most
delightfully
as
we
both
turned
somewhat
in
surprise
i
know
you
never
forgive
me
miss
loring
kennedy
began
but
the
fact
is
that
just
before
you
came
out
we
stumbled
into
a
new
bit
of
evidence
in
the
case
and
i
believe
that
jameson
and
i
will
have
to
hurry
in
to
the
laboratory
much
as
i
would
like
to
lunch
with
you
and
perhaps
chat
some
more
during
this
afternoon
it
seemed
to
me
that
her
eyes
widened
a
bit
certainly
there
was
a
perceptible
change
in
her
face
it
was
interest
but
it
was
also
certainly
more
than
that
i
felt
that
she
would
have
liked
to
penetrate
the
mask
of
kennedy
expression
perhaps
learn
just
what
facts
and
theories
rested
in
his
mind
is
it
suddenly
she
smiled
realizing
that
kennedy
would
reveal
only
the
little
which
suited
his
purpose
is
it
something
you
can
tell
me
she
finished
he
shook
his
head
his
answer
was
tantalizing
his
glance
searching
and
without
concealment
only
another
detail
concerning
the
chemical
analysis
of
the
poison
i
see
if
she
knew
of
the
ampulla
the
answer
would
have
been
intelligible
to
her
as
it
was
her
face
betrayed
nothing
i
guess
i
hurry
on
over
alone
then
she
added
she
extended
a
hand
to
each
of
us
her
grasp
was
warm
and
friendly
and
frank
so
long
and
and
good
luck
for
stella
sake
hello
folks
the
dancing
bantering
voice
from
behind
us
with
silvery
cadence
to
its
laughter
could
belong
to
no
one
but
enid
faye
i
grasped
that
it
was
her
car
which
kennedy
leaned
upon
i
gasped
a
bit
as
i
saw
her
directly
at
my
side
her
dainty
chamois
motoring
coat
brushing
my
sleeve
the
sun
which
grew
in
strength
every
moment
casting
mottled
shadows
upon
her
face
through
the
transparent
brim
of
her
bobbing
hat
in
mocking
answer
to
the
mirth
in
her
eyes
for
an
instant
she
gazed
after
the
retreating
marilyn
marilyn
dear
she
called
her
hands
the
other
girl
made
no
response
laughing
enid
slipped
a
hand
under
my
arm
the
firm
pressure
of
her
fingers
thrilling
me
she
addressed
kennedy
however
do
you
want
a
ride
in
to
the
city
both
of
you
kennedy
brightened
that
would
be
fine
how
far
are
you
going
the
burrage
i
have
a
luncheon
engagement
that
can
you
drop
us
off
at
the
university
surely
climb
in
it
a
tight
fit
three
in
the
seat
but
fun
and
facing
me
i
want
jamie
between
us
next
to
me
as
we
rolled
out
of
the
studio
inclosure
she
leaned
forward
on
the
wheel
to
question
kennedy
what
did
marilyn
loring
want
you
seemed
in
deep
confab
she
volunteered
to
initiate
us
to
mccann
across
the
street
oh
she
skidded
about
a
corner
skillfully
and
well
we
bumped
into
an
additional
piece
of
evidence
and
i
thought
jameson
and
i
ought
to
hurry
in
to
my
laboratory
instead
i
bet
enid
giggled
readjusting
her
hat
in
the
breeze
i
bet
she
wanted
to
know
what
you
found
right
away
did
she
yes
kennedy
face
was
noncommittal
why
do
you
say
that
because
she
came
into
my
room
just
as
we
were
getting
ready
for
work
this
morning
perhaps
i
wrong
but
from
the
way
she
kept
asking
me
questions
about
everyone
from
manton
down
i
got
the
idea
she
was
quizzing
me
to
see
how
much
i
knew
of
course
this
is
only
my
first
day
but
it
seems
to
me
that
marilyn
is
talking
a
great
deal
without
saying
very
much
i
come
to
the
conclusion
she
knows
a
good
deal
more
than
she
is
telling
anyone
and
that
she
like
to
find
out
just
how
much
everyone
else
knows
kennedy
nodded
almost
without
responding
further
well
enid
speeded
up
a
bit
not
to
change
connections
on
the
switchboard
i
think
i
going
to
like
it
with
manton
pictures
will
they
do
justice
to
your
work
kennedy
inquired
putting
you
in
a
partially
finished
picture
in
this
way
that
where
i
in
luck
real
luck
werner
has
directed
me
before
and
knows
just
exactly
how
to
handle
me
what
about
the
story
that
was
built
for
stella
was
it
yes
but
they
changing
it
here
and
there
to
fit
me
larry
knows
my
work
too
that
luck
again
for
little
enid
how
long
have
you
known
millard
in
a
flash
i
realized
cleverness
this
was
the
fact
he
had
wished
to
unearth
the
question
was
as
natural
as
could
be
he
had
led
up
to
it
deliberately
i
was
sure
of
that
four
nearly
five
years
she
replied
unsuspiciously
then
suddenly
she
bit
her
lip
although
her
expression
was
well
masked
that
is
she
added
somewhat
lamely
that
is
in
a
casual
way
like
nearly
everyone
knows
nearly
everyone
else
in
the
film
game
oh
murmured
kennedy
lapsing
into
silence
xv
i
become
a
detective
important
as
it
was
to
watch
enid
and
marilyn
werner
and
the
rest
kennedy
decided
that
it
was
now
much
more
important
to
hold
to
his
expressed
purpose
of
returning
to
the
laboratory
with
our
trophies
of
the
day
crime
hunt
for
people
to
whom
emotion
ought
to
be
an
old
story
in
their
everyday
stage
life
i
must
say
they
feel
and
show
plenty
of
it
in
real
life
i
remarked
as
enid
set
us
down
and
drove
off
it
does
not
seem
to
pall
i
do
know
why
the
movie
people
buy
stories
remarked
craig
quaintly
they
do
need
to
do
it
they
live
them
when
we
were
settled
in
the
laboratory
once
more
kennedy
plunged
with
renewed
vigor
into
the
investigation
he
had
dropped
in
the
morning
in
order
to
make
the
hurried
trip
to
the
phelps
home
in
tarrytown
i
had
hoped
he
would
talk
further
of
the
probabilities
of
the
connection
of
the
various
people
with
the
crime
but
he
had
no
comment
even
upon
the
admission
of
enid
that
she
had
known
millard
for
a
period
long
antedating
the
trouble
with
stella
lamar
it
seemed
that
after
all
he
was
quite
excited
at
the
discovery
of
the
ampulla
and
was
anxious
to
begin
the
analysis
of
its
contents
i
was
not
sure
but
it
struck
me
that
this
might
be
the
same
substance
which
had
spotted
the
towel
or
the
portieres
if
that
were
so
the
finding
of
it
in
this
form
had
given
him
a
new
and
tangible
clue
to
its
nature
accounting
for
his
eagerness
i
watched
his
elaborate
and
thorough
preparations
wishing
i
could
be
of
assistance
but
knowing
the
limitations
of
my
own
chemical
and
bacteriological
knowledge
i
grasped
however
that
he
was
concentrating
his
study
upon
the
spots
he
had
cut
from
the
portieres
in
particular
the
stain
where
the
point
of
the
needle
had
been
and
upon
the
incrustations
on
the
inner
surface
of
the
tube
he
made
solutions
of
both
of
these
and
for
some
little
time
experimented
with
chemical
reactions
then
he
had
recourse
to
several
weighty
technical
books
though
bursting
with
curiosity
i
dared
not
question
him
nor
distract
him
in
any
way
finally
he
turned
to
a
cage
where
he
kept
on
hand
always
a
few
of
those
useful
martyrs
to
science
guinea
pigs
taking
one
of
the
little
animals
and
segregating
him
from
the
others
he
prepared
to
inoculate
him
with
a
tiny
bit
of
the
solution
made
from
the
stain
on
the
piece
cut
from
the
portiere
at
that
i
knew
it
would
be
a
long
and
tiresome
analysis
it
seemed
a
waste
of
time
to
wait
idly
for
kennedy
to
reach
his
conclusions
so
i
cast
about
in
my
mind
for
some
sort
of
inquiry
of
my
own
which
i
could
conduct
meanwhile
perhaps
collecting
additional
facts
about
those
we
were
watching
at
the
studio
somehow
i
could
not
wholly
lose
my
suspicions
of
the
director
werner
especially
now
as
i
marshaled
the
evidence
against
him
first
of
all
he
was
the
only
person
absolutely
in
control
of
the
movements
of
stella
lamar
if
she
did
not
bring
up
her
arm
against
the
curtains
in
a
manner
calculated
to
press
the
needle
against
her
flesh
it
certainly
would
not
seem
out
of
the
way
for
him
to
ask
her
to
do
it
over
again
or
even
for
him
to
direct
changes
in
her
position
this
he
could
do
either
in
rehearsal
or
in
retakes
after
the
scene
had
actually
been
photographed
it
was
not
proof
i
knew
practically
all
of
them
were
familiar
with
the
action
of
the
scene
could
guess
how
werner
would
handle
it
the
point
was
that
the
director
next
to
millard
was
the
most
thoroughly
conversant
with
the
scenes
in
the
script
had
to
figure
out
everything
down
to
the
very
location
and
angles
of
the
camera
another
matter
of
course
was
the
placing
of
the
needle
in
the
silk
for
that
purpose
some
one
had
to
go
to
tarrytown
ahead
of
the
others
or
at
least
had
to
precede
the
others
into
the
living
room
offhand
i
was
compelled
to
admit
that
this
was
easiest
for
phelps
phelps
the
man
who
had
insisted
that
the
scene
be
taken
in
his
library
at
the
same
time
i
knew
it
was
quite
possible
for
the
director
to
have
entered
ahead
of
anyone
else
possible
for
him
to
have
issued
orders
to
his
people
which
would
keep
them
out
of
the
way
for
the
brief
moment
he
needed
a
third
consideration
was
the
finding
of
the
ampulla
in
car
stella
marilyn
jack
gordon
merle
shirley
and
werner
had
ridden
out
together
werner
had
not
returned
while
this
fact
did
not
indicate
definitely
that
he
might
have
dropped
it
coupled
with
the
other
considerations
it
pointed
the
suspicion
of
guilt
at
the
director
then
there
was
the
finding
of
the
towel
in
the
washroom
of
the
office
building
at
the
studio
while
kennedy
now
said
it
was
not
used
to
wipe
the
needle
while
we
now
knew
that
the
needle
remained
in
the
portieres
from
the
morning
of
stella
death
until
late
that
night
yet
kennedy
affirmed
the
connection
of
the
towel
with
the
crime
in
some
subtle
way
it
was
true
that
members
of
the
cast
sometimes
used
the
washroom
yet
it
was
evident
that
manton
millard
and
werner
who
had
rooms
on
the
floor
were
the
more
apt
to
be
concerned
in
the
attempt
to
dispose
of
it
against
manton
i
could
see
no
real
grounds
for
suspicion
in
a
general
way
we
had
been
compelled
to
eliminate
millard
early
in
our
investigation
again
i
was
brought
in
this
analysis
of
the
mystery
to
werner
one
other
point
remained
the
identity
of
the
nocturnal
visitor
to
tarrytown
in
connection
with
that
i
remembered
the
remark
of
marilyn
werner
was
acting
as
he
always
acted
when
he
was
out
late
the
night
before
she
had
said
while
my
theories
offered
no
explanation
of
the
second
man
the
watcher
i
saw
with
an
inner
feeling
of
triumph
that
everything
again
pointed
to
the
director
i
determined
not
to
tell
my
conclusion
to
kennedy
yet
i
did
not
want
to
distract
him
besides
i
felt
he
would
disagree
what
do
you
think
of
this
craig
i
suggested
suppose
i
start
out
while
you
busy
and
try
to
dig
up
some
more
facts
about
these
people
excellent
was
his
reply
i
ca
say
how
much
longer
my
analysis
will
keep
me
by
all
means
do
so
walter
i
shall
be
here
or
if
not
i
leave
a
note
so
you
can
find
me
accordingly
i
took
up
my
search
determined
to
go
slowly
and
carefully
not
to
be
misled
by
any
promising
but
fallacious
clues
i
knew
that
werner
would
be
working
at
the
studio
from
all
we
had
heard
in
the
morning
i
determined
upon
a
visit
to
his
apartment
in
his
absence
from
the
telephone
book
i
discovered
that
he
lived
at
the
whistler
studios
not
far
from
central
park
on
the
middle
west
side
a
new
building
i
remembered
inhabited
almost
entirely
by
artists
and
writers
as
i
hurried
down
on
the
subway
then
turned
and
walked
east
toward
the
park
i
racked
my
brain
for
an
excuse
to
get
in
entering
the
lower
reception
hall
i
learned
from
the
boy
that
the
director
had
a
suite
on
the
top
floor
high
enough
to
look
over
the
roofs
of
the
adjoining
buildings
directly
into
the
wide
expanse
of
green
and
road
of
pond
and
trees
beyond
werner
is
in
though
the
boy
added
doubtfully
without
ringing
the
apartment
i
know
it
i
rejoined
hastily
i
told
him
i
meet
him
here
this
afternoon
however
on
a
chance
i
went
on
with
a
knowing
smile
i
guess
it
was
pretty
late
when
he
came
in
last
night
i
say
so
grinned
the
youth
friendly
all
of
a
sudden
he
had
interpreted
the
remark
as
i
intended
he
should
he
believed
that
werner
and
i
had
been
out
together
i
remember
he
volunteered
because
i
had
to
do
an
extra
shift
of
duty
last
night
worse
luck
it
must
have
been
after
four
i
was
almost
asleep
when
i
heard
the
taxi
at
the
door
i
wonder
what
company
he
got
the
taxi
from
i
remarked
casually
i
tried
to
get
one
uptown
i
paused
i
did
want
to
get
into
a
maze
of
falsehood
from
which
i
would
be
unable
to
extricate
myself
i
do
know
he
replied
it
looked
like
one
of
the
maroon
taxis
from
up
at
the
central
park
hotel
on
the
next
block
but
i
not
sure
i
think
i
wo
go
upstairs
yet
i
said
finally
there
another
call
i
ought
to
make
if
werner
comes
in
tell
him
i
be
back
i
knew
very
well
that
werner
would
not
return
but
i
thought
that
the
bluff
might
pave
the
way
for
getting
upstairs
and
into
the
apartment
a
little
later
meanwhile
i
had
another
errand
the
boy
nodded
a
as
i
passed
out
through
the
grilled
iron
doors
to
the
street
less
than
five
minutes
afterward
i
was
at
the
booth
of
the
maroon
taxi
company
at
the
side
of
the
main
entrance
of
the
central
park
hotel
here
the
starter
proved
to
be
a
loquacious
individual
and
i
caught
him
fortunately
in
the
slowest
part
of
the
afternoon
removing
a
pipe
and
pushing
a
battered
cap
to
the
back
of
a
bald
head
he
pulled
out
the
sheets
of
the
previous
day
before
me
were
recorded
all
the
calls
for
taxicab
service
with
the
names
of
drivers
addresses
of
calls
and
destinations
although
the
quarters
in
the
booth
were
cramped
and
close
and
made
villainous
by
the
reek
of
the
man
pipe
i
began
to
scan
the
lists
eagerly
it
had
been
a
busy
night
even
down
to
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
and
i
had
quite
a
job
as
i
came
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
end
my
hopes
ebbed
however
when
i
was
through
i
had
failed
to
identify
a
single
call
that
might
have
been
werner
several
fares
had
been
driven
to
and
from
the
grand
central
station
probably
the
means
by
which
he
made
the
trip
to
tarrytown
in
each
case
the
record
had
shown
the
central
park
hotel
in
the
other
column
not
the
whistler
studios
i
was
forced
to
give
up
this
clue
and
it
hurt
i
was
not
built
for
a
detective
i
guess
for
i
almost
quit
then
and
there
prepared
to
return
to
the
laboratory
and
kennedy
but
i
remembered
my
first
intention
and
made
my
way
back
to
the
whistler
studios
anyhow
i
reflected
werner
would
hardly
have
summoned
a
car
from
a
place
so
near
his
home
had
he
wished
to
keep
his
trip
a
secret
it
was
more
important
for
me
to
gain
access
to
his
quarters
there
it
was
quite
possible
i
might
find
something
valuable
i
wondered
if
i
would
be
justified
in
breaking
in
or
if
i
would
succeed
if
i
attempted
it
things
proved
easier
than
i
expected
my
first
visit
unquestionably
had
prepared
the
way
the
hallboy
took
me
up
in
the
elevator
himself
without
telephoning
took
me
to
werner
door
rang
the
bell
and
spoke
to
the
colored
valet
who
opened
it
as
i
grasped
the
presence
of
the
servant
in
the
little
suite
i
was
glad
i
had
not
tried
my
hand
at
forcing
an
entrance
i
had
quite
anticipated
an
empty
apartment
the
darky
pleasant
voiced
polite
and
well
trained
bowed
me
into
a
little
den
and
proceeded
to
lay
out
a
large
box
of
cigarettes
on
the
table
beside
me
as
well
as
a
humidor
well
filled
with
cigars
of
good
quality
i
took
one
of
the
latter
accepting
a
light
and
glancing
about
certainly
this
was
in
contrast
with
manton
apartment
there
was
nothing
garish
ornate
or
spectacular
here
richly
lavishly
furnished
everything
was
in
perfect
taste
revealing
the
hand
of
an
artist
it
might
have
been
a
bit
bizarre
reflecting
the
nervous
temperament
of
its
owner
even
the
servant
showed
the
touch
of
his
master
hovering
about
to
make
sure
i
was
comfortable
even
to
bringing
a
stack
of
the
latest
magazines
i
hope
he
did
sense
my
thoughts
for
i
cursed
him
inwardly
i
wanted
to
be
alone
ordinarily
i
would
have
enjoyed
this
but
now
i
had
become
a
detective
and
it
was
necessary
to
rummage
about
and
quickly
the
sudden
ringing
of
the
telephone
took
the
valet
out
into
the
tiny
hall
of
the
suite
and
gave
me
the
opportunity
i
wished
phelps
apparently
was
calling
up
to
leave
some
message
for
werner
which
i
could
not
get
as
the
valet
took
it
what
i
wondered
was
phelps
telephoning
here
for
why
not
at
the
studio
it
looked
strange
i
lost
no
time
in
speculation
over
that
however
the
moment
i
was
left
to
myself
i
jumped
up
and
rushed
to
a
writing
desk
a
carved
antique
which
had
caught
my
eye
upon
my
entrance
which
i
had
studied
from
my
place
in
the
easy
chair
it
was
unlocked
and
i
opened
it
without
compunction
with
an
alert
ear
to
warn
me
the
moment
the
colored
boy
hung
up
i
first
gazed
rather
helplessly
at
a
huge
pile
of
literary
litter
clearly
there
was
no
time
to
go
through
all
of
that
i
gave
the
papers
a
cursory
inspection
without
disturbing
them
hoping
to
catch
some
name
or
something
which
might
prove
to
be
a
random
clue
but
i
was
less
lucky
than
kennedy
had
been
in
his
casual
look
at
manton
desk
the
afternoon
before
still
able
to
hear
the
valet
at
the
telephone
i
reached
down
and
opened
the
top
drawer
of
the
desk
here
perhaps
i
might
be
more
fortunate
one
glance
and
my
heart
gave
a
startled
leap
there
in
a
compartment
of
the
drawer
i
saw
a
hypodermic
needle
in
fact
two
of
them
and
a
bottle
on
the
desk
was
a
fountain
pen
ink
dropper
a
new
one
which
had
never
been
used
i
reached
over
pressed
its
little
bulb
uncorked
the
bottle
inserted
the
glass
point
sucked
up
some
of
the
contents
placed
the
bulb
right
side
up
in
my
waistcoat
pocket
and
recorked
the
bottle
next
i
took
and
pocketed
one
of
the
two
needles
both
of
which
were
alike
as
far
as
i
could
see
then
i
heard
a
in
the
hall
i
closed
drawer
and
desk
hastily
as
i
caught
the
click
of
the
receiver
of
the
telephone
on
its
hook
i
was
halfway
across
the
floor
before
the
colored
boy
could
enter
again
i
was
back
in
my
chair
my
head
literally
in
a
whirl
what
a
stroke
of
good
fortune
i
had
no
expectation
of
proving
werner
to
be
the
guilty
man
by
so
simple
a
method
as
this
however
if
he
were
the
slayer
of
the
star
he
would
be
too
clever
to
leave
anything
so
incriminating
about
i
have
always
quarreled
with
poe
theory
in
the
purloined
letter
believing
that
the
obvious
is
no
place
to
hide
anything
outside
of
fiction
what
i
conceived
rather
was
that
werner
really
was
a
dope
fiend
the
nature
of
the
drug
kennedy
would
tell
me
very
easily
from
the
sample
establishing
werner
possession
of
the
needles
was
another
point
in
my
chain
of
presumptions
showing
that
he
was
familiar
with
their
use
and
added
to
that
was
the
psychological
effect
upon
him
of
the
habit
a
habit
responsible
in
many
other
cases
for
murders
as
skillfully
carried
out
as
that
of
stella
lamar
often
too
without
the
slightest
shred
of
real
motive
i
recalled
werner
habitually
nervous
manner
and
was
sure
now
that
the
needles
actually
were
used
by
him
was
it
due
to
the
high
pressure
of
his
profession
had
that
constant
high
tension
forced
him
to
find
relief
in
the
most
violent
relaxation
elated
i
was
tempted
at
first
to
crowd
my
luck
i
wondered
if
i
could
not
discover
another
ampulla
such
as
the
chauffeur
mcgroarty
had
picked
up
in
his
car
when
werner
servant
almost
apologetically
explained
that
the
telephone
message
was
from
a
shop
and
that
he
would
have
to
leave
me
for
a
matter
of
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
i
assured
him
that
it
was
all
right
and
that
i
would
occupy
myself
with
a
magazine
the
moment
he
was
out
the
door
i
sprang
to
action
and
began
a
minute
search
of
every
nook
and
cranny
of
the
rooms
but
gradually
a
sense
of
growing
fear
and
trepidation
took
hold
of
me
suppose
after
all
werner
should
return
home
unexpectedly
the
colored
boy
did
not
seem
surprised
that
i
should
wait
a
slight
indication
that
it
was
possible
further
i
could
never
tell
when
the
darky
might
not
return
himself
breaking
in
upon
me
without
warning
and
discovering
me
at
the
best
i
was
not
a
skillful
investigator
i
did
not
know
just
where
to
look
for
hidden
evidences
of
poison
nor
was
i
able
to
work
fast
for
fear
of
leaving
too
tangible
marks
of
my
actions
behind
me
a
great
perspiration
stood
out
on
my
forehead
gradually
a
trembling
took
hold
of
my
limbs
and
communicated
itself
to
my
fingers
after
all
it
was
essential
that
werner
be
kept
in
ignorance
of
my
suspicions
granting
they
were
correct
it
would
be
fatal
if
i
should
frighten
him
inadvertently
so
that
he
would
take
to
flight
realizing
my
foolhardiness
i
returned
to
my
chair
at
last
picking
up
a
magazine
at
random
i
did
so
not
a
moment
too
soon
a
slight
sound
caught
my
ear
and
i
looked
up
to
see
the
valet
already
halfway
into
the
room
his
tread
was
so
soft
i
never
would
have
heard
him
i
do
think
i
wait
any
longer
i
remarked
rising
and
stretching
slightly
as
though
i
had
been
seated
all
the
time
i
ring
up
a
little
later
perhaps
come
back
after
i
get
in
touch
with
mr
werner
who
shall
i
say
was
here
sah
the
boy
asked
with
just
a
trace
of
darky
dialect
above
all
i
did
want
to
alarm
werner
i
could
not
repeat
the
explanation
i
had
allowed
the
attendant
downstairs
to
assume
from
my
remark
that
i
was
a
friend
who
had
been
out
with
the
director
the
night
before
i
should
have
to
take
a
chance
that
werner
servant
and
the
hallboy
would
not
compare
notes
and
that
the
latter
would
say
nothing
to
the
director
upon
his
arrival
i
an
old
friend
from
the
coast
i
explained
with
a
show
of
taking
the
negro
into
my
confidence
i
wanted
to
surprise
him
and
so
i
slipped
a
half
dollar
into
a
willing
palm
if
you
say
nothing
until
i
seen
him
he
beamed
yes
sah
you
jus
count
on
george
sah
downstairs
i
wondered
if
i
could
seal
the
tongue
of
the
youth
who
had
accommodated
me
before
then
i
discovered
that
he
had
gone
off
duty
it
would
be
extremely
unlikely
that
he
would
be
about
until
the
following
day
i
smiled
and
hastened
out
to
the
street
once
in
the
open
air
again
i
realized
the
full
extent
of
the
risk
i
had
taken
all
at
once
it
struck
me
that
no
amount
of
explanation
from
either
kennedy
or
myself
would
serve
to
mollify
werner
if
he
were
innocent
and
learned
of
my
visit
i
doubted
in
this
moment
of
afterthought
that
i
would
escape
censure
from
kennedy
who
surely
would
not
want
his
case
jeopardized
by
precipitate
actions
upon
my
part
i
began
to
run
to
get
away
from
the
whistler
studios
as
fast
as
possible
then
i
saw
i
had
grown
panicky
and
i
checked
myself
but
i
hurried
to
the
subway
and
up
to
the
university
again
and
to
the
laboratory
eager
to
compare
notes
with
kennedy
if
i
were
alphonse
dupin
he
remarked
calmly
grasping
my
excitement
i
would
deduce
that
you
have
discovered
something
i
would
also
deduce
that
you
believe
it
important
and
that
you
have
no
intention
of
withholding
the
information
from
me
whatever
it
is
correct
i
answered
grinning
in
spite
of
myself
then
i
handed
him
the
needle
telling
him
in
a
few
brief
words
of
my
visit
to
werner
apartment
of
the
hallboy
confirmation
of
a
nocturnal
trip
of
some
sort
of
my
search
of
the
desk
and
some
other
parts
of
the
suite
i
fixed
it
so
that
he
wo
hear
of
my
visit
at
least
for
some
time
he
wo
suspect
who
it
was
in
any
case
kennedy
examined
the
hypodermic
not
like
the
one
used
he
murmured
i
thought
that
i
explained
it
simply
indicates
he
is
a
dope
fiend
and
is
familiar
with
the
use
of
a
needle
here
i
produced
the
ink
filler
which
i
had
used
to
bring
a
sample
of
the
contents
of
the
bottle
this
seems
to
be
what
he
uses
what
is
it
kennedy
sniffed
then
looked
closely
at
the
liquid
through
the
glass
of
the
tube
it
a
coca
preparation
he
explained
if
werner
uses
this
he
unquestionably
a
regular
drug
addict
well
i
paused
triumphantly
the
case
against
the
chief
director
of
manton
pictures
grows
stronger
all
the
time
not
necessarily
contradicted
kennedy
perhaps
to
draw
me
out
he
familiar
with
hypodermic
syringes
i
repeated
which
does
prove
that
no
one
else
would
use
one
anyhow
he
was
out
until
four
last
night
and
some
one
broke
into
phelps
house
to
you
ca
establish
the
fact
that
he
went
out
there
there
are
plenty
of
other
places
he
could
have
been
until
four
in
the
morning
but
i
can
assume
if
you
are
going
to
assume
anything
walter
why
not
assume
he
was
the
second
man
the
man
who
watched
the
actual
intruder
i
turned
away
despairing
of
my
ability
to
convince
kennedy
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
had
forgotten
the
other
prowler
at
tarrytown
then
i
noticed
that
the
one
guinea
pig
in
the
separate
cage
was
dead
in
an
instant
i
was
all
curiosity
to
know
the
results
of
investigations
did
you
make
any
progress
i
asked
yes
now
i
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
he
was
in
fine
humor
i
had
quite
finished
the
first
stage
of
my
analysis
when
you
came
in
then
what
was
it
what
was
the
poison
that
killed
stella
lamar
i
glanced
at
the
stiff
prone
figure
of
the
little
animal
kennedy
cleared
his
throat
well
he
replied
i
began
the
study
with
the
discovery
i
made
which
i
told
you
that
strange
proteins
were
present
he
picked
up
the
ampulla
and
regarded
it
thoughtfully
then
he
fingered
the
bit
of
silk
cut
from
the
portieres
it
is
a
poison
more
deadly
more
subtle
than
any
ever
concocted
by
man
walter
yes
i
was
painfully
eager
it
is
snake
venom
xvi
enid
assists
a
poison
more
subtle
than
any
concocted
by
man
repeated
kennedy
it
was
a
startling
declaration
and
left
me
quite
speechless
for
the
moment
we
know
next
to
nothing
of
the
composition
of
the
protein
bodies
in
the
snake
venoms
which
have
such
terrific
and
quick
physiological
effects
on
man
kennedy
went
on
they
have
been
studied
it
is
true
and
studied
a
great
deal
but
we
can
not
say
that
there
are
any
adequate
tests
by
which
the
presence
of
these
proteins
can
be
recognized
however
everything
points
to
the
conclusion
now
that
it
was
snake
venom
and
my
physiological
tests
on
the
guinea
pig
seem
to
confirm
it
i
see
no
reason
now
to
doubt
that
it
was
snake
venom
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
snake
venoms
are
about
the
safest
of
poisons
for
the
criminal
to
use
for
the
reason
of
the
difficulty
they
give
in
any
chemical
analysis
that
is
only
another
proof
of
the
diabolical
cleverness
of
our
guilty
person
whoever
it
may
be
later
i
identify
the
particular
kind
of
venom
used
just
now
i
feel
it
is
more
important
to
discover
the
actual
motive
for
the
crime
in
the
morning
i
have
a
plan
which
may
save
me
further
work
here
in
the
laboratory
but
for
i
feel
i
have
earned
a
rest
and
a
smile
i
shall
rest
by
searching
out
the
motives
of
these
temperamental
movie
folk
a
little
more
as
he
spoke
he
slipped
out
of
his
smock
what
do
you
mean
as
often
he
rather
baffled
me
it
nearly
dinner
time
and
we
going
out
together
walter
down
to
jacques
why
jacques
because
i
phoned
your
friend
belle
balcom
and
she
informed
me
that
that
was
the
place
where
we
would
be
apt
to
find
the
elite
of
the
film
world
dining
i
acquiesced
of
course
we
hurried
to
the
apartment
first
for
a
few
necessary
changes
and
preparations
then
we
started
for
the
times
square
section
in
a
taxi
i
never
heard
of
the
use
of
snake
venom
before
i
remarked
settling
back
in
the
cushions
that
is
deliberately
by
a
criminal
to
poison
anyone
there
are
cases
replied
craig
absently
just
how
does
the
venom
act
i
believe
it
is
generally
accepted
that
there
are
two
agents
present
in
the
secretion
one
is
a
peptone
and
the
other
a
globulin
one
is
neurotoxic
the
other
hemolytic
not
only
is
the
general
nervous
system
attacked
instantly
but
the
coagulability
of
the
blood
is
destroyed
one
agent
in
the
venom
attacks
the
nerve
cells
the
other
destroys
the
red
corpuscles
you
suspected
something
of
this
kind
then
when
you
first
examined
stella
lamar
exactly
you
see
the
victim
of
a
snake
bite
often
is
unable
to
move
or
speak
doctor
blake
observed
that
in
the
case
of
the
stricken
star
her
nerves
were
affected
resulting
in
paralysis
of
the
muscles
of
the
heart
and
lungs
and
giving
us
some
symptoms
of
suffocation
then
the
blood
as
a
result
of
the
attack
of
the
venom
is
always
left
dark
and
liquid
that
too
i
observed
in
the
sample
sent
me
from
tarrytown
the
snake
kennedy
continued
administers
the
poison
by
fangs
more
delicate
than
any
hypodermic
nature
apparatus
is
more
precise
than
the
finest
appliances
devised
for
the
use
of
a
surgeon
by
our
instrument
makers
the
fangs
are
like
needles
with
obliquely
cut
points
and
outlets
the
poison
glands
correspond
to
the
bulb
of
a
syringe
they
are
in
reality
highly
modified
salivary
glands
from
them
when
the
serpent
strikes
is
ejected
a
pale
fluid
you
might
swallow
it
with
impunity
but
once
in
the
blood
through
a
cut
or
wound
it
is
deadly
there
could
be
no
snake
in
this
case
i
remarked
the
fangs
of
a
serpent
make
two
punctures
do
they
while
here
there
was
just
the
one
scratch
of
course
there
were
no
fangs
when
the
deed
was
actually
done
he
rejoined
impatiently
we
traced
everything
to
the
needle
in
the
portieres
and
it
is
my
belief
that
it
was
part
of
an
hypodermic
with
a
point
it
could
hardly
have
been
anything
like
the
coarser
syringe
used
by
werner
nor
do
i
think
it
possible
that
the
point
of
an
ordinary
needle
would
hold
sufficient
venom
since
it
would
dry
and
form
a
coating
like
the
incrustation
on
the
inside
of
the
ampulla
mcgroarty
found
that
was
the
venom
i
asked
yes
i
found
it
in
the
ampulla
and
in
the
stain
on
the
portiere
where
the
needle
had
pierced
through
the
towel
though
is
something
else
first
thing
in
the
morning
we
follow
that
up
as
i
promised
you
meanwhile
let
concentrate
on
motives
a
long
line
of
private
cars
and
taxicabs
outside
jacques
testified
to
the
popularity
of
the
restaurant
at
the
door
stood
a
huge
bulking
negro
resplendent
in
the
glaring
finery
of
his
uniform
it
seemed
to
me
that
people
literally
were
thronging
into
the
place
for
it
was
cleverly
advertised
as
a
center
of
night
life
inside
the
famous
darky
jazz
band
was
in
full
swing
there
was
lilt
and
rhythm
to
the
melody
produced
by
the
grinning
blacks
and
not
a
free
arm
or
foot
or
shoulder
or
head
of
any
of
them
but
did
not
sway
in
time
to
their
syncopated
music
we
were
shown
to
a
table
on
a
sort
of
gallery
or
mezzanine
floor
which
extended
around
three
sides
of
the
interior
below
in
the
center
was
the
space
for
dancing
surrounded
by
groups
and
pairs
of
diners
stairs
led
to
the
balcony
on
both
sides
as
though
the
management
expected
none
of
their
guests
to
resist
the
lure
of
the
dance
between
courses
the
band
i
noticed
was
at
the
farther
end
on
an
elevated
dais
so
that
the
contortions
of
the
various
players
could
be
seen
above
the
heads
of
those
on
the
floor
we
were
at
the
rail
so
that
we
commanded
a
view
of
the
entire
place
a
location
i
guessed
had
been
maneuvered
by
kennedy
with
a
word
to
the
head
waiter
the
only
tables
invisible
to
us
were
those
directly
beneath
but
it
would
be
a
simple
matter
to
cross
around
during
any
dance
number
to
view
them
as
we
took
our
seats
the
lights
were
dimmed
suddenly
i
realized
that
we
had
arrived
in
the
midst
of
the
cabaret
and
that
it
was
the
turn
of
one
of
the
performers
kennedy
however
seemed
to
enjoy
the
entertainment
an
example
of
his
ability
to
gain
recreation
whenever
and
however
he
wished
to
find
relaxation
under
the
oddest
or
most
casual
circumstances
out
of
anything
from
people
passing
on
the
street
to
an
impromptu
concert
of
a
street
band
in
scanty
garments
in
the
glare
of
a
spotlight
the
girl
danced
a
hybrid
of
every
dance
from
the
earliest
grecian
bacchanal
to
the
latest
alleged
apache
importation
from
paris
i
have
often
wondered
at
jacques
and
places
of
the
sort
the
intermingling
of
eating
and
drinking
and
dancing
was
curious
what
possible
bearing
this
terpsichorean
monstrosity
might
have
upon
the
gastronomic
inclinations
of
the
audience
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
fathom
the
lights
flashed
bright
again
and
kennedy
gave
our
order
meanwhile
i
glanced
about
at
the
people
below
us
there
was
no
one
in
sight
i
knew
until
i
leaned
well
over
the
rail
but
upon
doing
that
i
felt
little
chills
of
excitement
run
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
of
my
spine
for
i
discovered
in
a
very
prominent
situation
at
the
very
edge
of
the
dance
floor
a
party
of
four
of
whom
three
very
much
concerned
us
lloyd
manton
back
to
the
polished
space
behind
him
was
unmistakable
in
evening
clothes
these
bunched
at
his
neck
and
revealed
his
habitual
stoop
as
impartially
as
his
business
suits
across
from
him
lounging
upon
the
table
likewise
but
more
immaculately
and
skillfully
tailored
was
lawrence
millard
the
writer
i
noticed
flourished
his
cigarette
holder
fully
a
foot
in
length
and
emphasized
his
remarks
to
the
girl
on
his
right
with
a
rather
characteristic
gesture
made
with
the
second
finger
of
his
left
hand
the
girl
was
enid
quite
mistress
of
herself
in
a
gown
little
more
than
no
gown
and
the
remarks
were
obviously
confidential
the
other
girl
engrossed
in
manton
seemed
a
dangerously
youthful
and
young
lady
her
hair
flamed
titian
red
and
her
neck
of
which
she
displayed
not
half
as
much
as
enid
gave
her
much
concern
kennedy
look
i
reached
over
to
attract
his
attention
who
the
second
girl
i
wonder
he
became
as
interested
as
i
was
with
a
blatant
flourish
of
saxophone
and
cornet
and
traps
the
band
began
a
jazzy
instantly
there
was
a
rush
from
the
tables
for
the
floor
enid
jumped
to
her
feet
moving
her
bare
shoulders
in
the
rhythm
of
the
music
then
millard
took
firm
hold
of
her
and
they
wove
their
way
into
the
crush
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
little
star
was
the
very
incarnation
of
the
dance
i
envied
her
partner
more
than
i
dared
admit
to
myself
manton
and
his
companion
rose
also
but
more
leisurely
on
her
feet
the
girl
did
not
seem
so
young
although
the
second
impression
may
have
been
the
result
of
the
length
of
her
skirt
and
the
long
slim
lines
of
her
gown
we
watched
both
couples
through
the
number
then
gave
our
attention
to
the
food
we
had
ordered
another
dance
a
modified
waltz
revealed
enid
in
the
arms
of
manton
i
tried
to
determine
from
her
actions
if
she
felt
any
preference
for
the
producer
or
for
millard
when
again
she
took
the
floor
with
him
it
was
an
idle
effort
of
course
the
people
surged
out
perhaps
three
or
four
times
while
we
were
at
our
meal
each
time
the
party
below
jumped
up
in
response
to
the
music
at
our
cigars
finally
i
took
to
observing
the
other
diners
wondering
what
we
had
gained
by
coming
here
suddenly
i
realized
that
kennedy
was
rising
to
greet
some
one
approaching
our
table
turning
rising
also
i
went
through
all
the
miseries
of
the
bashful
lover
it
was
enid
herself
i
caught
sight
of
you
looking
over
the
rail
while
i
was
dancing
she
told
kennedy
accepting
a
chair
pulled
around
by
the
waiter
i
knew
you
saw
me
also
i
glanced
up
and
found
that
you
were
perfectly
well
aware
of
the
location
of
our
table
so
engagingly
unsociable
creature
why
did
you
come
down
and
say
or
ask
me
for
a
dance
perhaps
i
intended
to
a
little
later
yes
she
exclaimed
in
mockery
you
see
since
mecca
wo
go
to
the
pilgrim
the
pilgrim
has
to
come
to
mecca
did
you
ever
hear
of
mohammed
and
the
mountain
miss
faye
kennedy
asked
of
course
that
the
regular
expression
but
i
agree
with
barnum
as
he
said
some
people
can
be
original
some
of
the
time
and
some
people
can
be
original
all
of
the
time
and
i
propose
to
be
original
always
like
a
baby
with
molasses
kennedy
laughed
for
indeed
she
was
irresistible
then
she
turned
to
me
placing
one
of
her
warm
little
hands
upon
mine
and
jamie
she
purred
have
you
forgotten
little
enid
altogether
wo
wo
you
come
down
and
dance
i
i
ca
i
exploded
in
agony
i
do
know
how
and
i
thought
that
i
would
never
dare
trust
myself
with
her
glistening
shoulders
clasped
close
to
me
with
her
slim
bare
arm
placed
around
my
neck
as
i
had
watched
it
slip
about
the
collar
of
millard
now
that
the
pilgrim
is
at
mecca
kennedy
suggested
interrupting
cruelly
as
i
thought
oh
in
an
instant
i
sensed
that
i
was
forgotten
and
i
was
hurt
there
something
which
came
out
this
afternoon
at
the
studio
she
began
and
i
wonder
if
you
know
larry
that
millard
assures
me
it
is
true
and
and
i
think
you
ought
to
hear
about
it
i
i
want
to
assist
all
i
can
in
solving
the
mystery
of
stella
lamar
death
even
though
stella
unfortunate
end
has
meant
my
opportunity
what
is
it
miss
faye
kennedy
was
studying
her
it
about
jack
gordon
he
been
trying
to
hold
up
the
company
for
fifteen
hundred
a
week
which
would
double
his
salary
perhaps
heard
that
kennedy
nodded
although
it
was
news
to
him
i
been
thinking
about
gordon
he
murmured
anyway
she
went
on
it
gone
around
that
he
desperately
in
need
of
money
and
that
that
is
why
he
so
insistent
upon
the
increase
it
seems
he
owes
everyone
in
particular
he
owes
phelps
some
huge
sums
and
old
phelps
is
on
his
tail
hollering
and
raising
ned
phelps
you
know
has
uses
for
money
himself
just
now
you
had
heard
again
kennedy
evaded
a
direct
answer
money
is
fearfully
tight
of
course
he
remarked
encouraging
her
to
continue
yes
she
repeated
phelps
is
terribly
hard
up
and
after
gordon
and
that
not
all
about
our
handsome
leading
man
mr
kennedy
she
leaned
forward
a
certain
intensity
crept
into
her
voice
she
began
to
toy
with
his
sleeve
with
the
slender
fingers
of
one
hand
as
though
in
that
manner
to
compel
his
greater
attention
you
know
stella
lamar
really
was
in
love
with
jack
gordon
in
fact
she
was
daffy
over
him
and
now
i
found
out
that
he
was
borrowing
money
from
her
was
taking
nearly
every
cent
she
earned
to
sink
in
his
speculations
do
you
get
that
enid
eyes
snapped
most
certainly
i
understood
i
knew
well
the
type
of
stella
she
had
made
many
men
give
up
to
her
motor
cars
expensive
furs
jewelry
all
manner
of
presents
but
in
the
end
she
had
found
one
man
to
whom
she
in
turn
was
willing
to
yield
all
but
what
of
him
in
the
last
few
weeks
they
tell
me
poor
stella
disposed
of
many
of
her
handsome
presents
from
men
like
manton
and
phelps
and
others
all
to
get
money
to
give
to
him
at
the
end
she
even
raised
money
on
her
jewelry
i
i
think
you
find
it
all
in
pawn
now
if
investigate
i
do
doubt
but
that
poor
stella
died
without
a
penny
to
her
name
i
was
so
surprised
at
this
information
that
i
failed
to
study
face
i
was
completely
jolted
from
my
own
rapt
contemplation
of
the
very
soft
curves
of
enid
back
for
here
was
a
motive
at
last
gordon
was
a
possible
suspect
i
had
failed
to
take
even
halfway
seriously
yet
the
leading
man
was
desperately
pressed
for
money
had
had
a
disgraceful
fight
with
phelps
as
we
already
knew
and
not
only
owed
huge
sums
to
his
fiancee
as
enid
now
explained
but
had
quarreled
with
her
just
prior
to
her
death
according
to
his
own
admission
in
the
investigation
at
tarrytown
suddenly
the
music
struck
up
once
more
enid
rose
adjusting
the
straps
of
her
gown
there
she
exclaimed
smiling
abruptly
i
thought
you
ought
to
know
that
though
i
hate
to
peddle
gossip
now
i
must
hurry
back
i
been
away
long
enough
but
come
down
later
and
dance
she
swept
off
without
further
formality
an
instant
afterward
we
saw
her
in
the
clasp
of
millard
once
again
we
watched
during
the
number
and
encore
then
kennedy
called
for
the
check
let
go
up
to
the
apartment
he
suggested
i
like
to
talk
some
of
these
things
out
with
you
it
will
help
me
clarify
my
own
impressions
underneath
the
balcony
i
noticed
kennedy
turn
for
a
last
glance
at
manton
party
i
paused
to
look
also
enid
was
leaning
forward
talking
to
millard
earnestly
emphasizing
what
she
had
to
say
with
characteristic
movements
of
her
head
she
pumping
millard
for
more
information
about
stella
lamar
i
remarked
kennedy
had
no
comment
xvii
an
appeal
we
strolled
up
broadway
resisting
the
attraction
of
a
garish
new
palace
at
which
manton
previous
release
with
stella
lamar
was
now
showing
to
capacity
much
to
the
delight
of
the
exhibitor
who
greatly
complimented
himself
on
his
good
fortune
in
being
able
to
take
advantage
of
the
newspaper
sensation
over
the
affair
on
we
walked
kennedy
mostly
in
silent
deduction
i
knew
until
we
came
to
the
upper
regions
of
the
great
thoroughfare
turned
off
and
headed
toward
our
apartment
on
the
heights
not
far
from
the
university
we
had
scarcely
settled
ourselves
for
a
quiet
hour
in
our
quarters
when
the
telephone
rang
i
answered
to
my
amazement
i
found
that
it
was
marilyn
loring
is
professor
kennedy
in
she
asked
yes
miss
loring
just
a
never
mind
calling
him
to
the
phone
jameson
i
been
trying
to
find
him
all
evening
he
was
not
at
the
laboratory
although
i
waited
over
an
hour
just
tell
him
that
there
something
i
am
very
anxious
to
consult
him
about
ask
him
if
it
will
be
all
right
for
me
to
run
up
to
see
him
just
a
few
minutes
i
explained
to
kennedy
let
her
come
along
he
said
as
surprised
as
i
was
then
he
added
humorously
i
seem
to
be
father
confessor
after
sinking
back
in
my
seat
in
comfort
once
more
i
observed
a
quiet
elation
in
kennedy
manner
all
at
once
it
struck
me
what
he
was
doing
the
multitude
of
considerations
in
this
case
the
many
cross
leads
to
be
followed
had
confused
me
but
now
i
realized
that
after
all
this
was
only
the
approved
kennedy
method
the
mode
of
procedure
which
had
never
failed
to
produce
results
for
him
without
allowing
himself
to
be
disturbed
by
the
great
number
of
people
concerned
he
had
calmly
started
to
pit
them
one
against
the
other
encouraging
each
to
talk
about
the
rest
making
a
show
of
his
apparent
inaction
and
lack
of
haste
so
that
they
in
turn
would
shake
off
the
excitement
immediately
following
the
death
of
the
girl
and
thereby
reveal
their
normal
selves
to
his
keen
observation
not
five
minutes
passed
before
marilyn
was
announced
evidently
she
had
been
seeking
us
eagerly
for
she
had
probably
telephoned
from
a
pay
station
kennedy
she
began
i
am
going
to
find
this
very
hard
to
say
really
he
assured
her
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
not
repose
your
confidence
in
me
my
only
interest
is
to
solve
the
mystery
and
to
see
that
justice
is
satisfied
beyond
that
nothing
would
give
me
greater
happiness
than
to
be
of
service
to
you
it
it
about
merle
shirley
she
started
bravely
then
all
at
once
she
broke
down
the
strain
of
two
days
had
been
too
much
for
her
kennedy
lighted
a
fresh
cigar
realizing
that
he
could
best
aid
her
to
recover
her
composure
by
making
no
effort
to
do
so
for
several
moments
she
sobbed
silently
a
handkerchief
at
her
eyes
then
she
straightened
with
a
half
smile
dabbing
at
the
drops
of
moisture
remaining
with
her
wet
eyes
and
flushed
cheeks
she
was
revealed
to
me
again
as
a
very
genuine
girl
wholly
unspoiled
by
her
outward
mask
of
sophistication
furthermore
at
this
instant
she
was
gloriously
pretty
again
why
do
you
play
vampire
roles
miss
loring
i
asked
as
quickly
as
the
thought
flashed
to
me
i
think
you
be
an
ideal
ingenue
about
a
thousand
people
have
told
me
that
she
rejoined
as
she
replied
her
smile
took
full
possession
of
her
features
my
idiotic
repetition
entirely
out
of
place
had
served
to
restore
her
to
her
no
the
public
wo
stand
for
it
they
been
trained
to
know
me
as
a
vamp
and
a
vamp
i
remain
facing
kennedy
she
sobered
merle
shirley
and
i
were
engaged
she
went
on
that
you
know
then
poor
stella
made
a
fool
of
him
she
did
mean
any
harm
any
real
harm
but
i
do
think
she
knew
how
deep
he
feels
or
just
what
a
fiery
temper
he
has
finally
he
found
out
that
she
was
only
playing
with
him
he
was
perfectly
terrible
at
first
i
thought
he
had
killed
her
in
a
burst
of
passion
i
really
thought
that
yes
kennedy
was
interested
he
needed
no
pretense
when
i
asked
him
point
blank
he
said
he
did
a
very
wonderful
light
came
into
marilyn
loring
eyes
at
this
instant
whatever
else
he
would
do
professor
kennedy
he
would
lie
to
me
that
i
know
he
would
tell
me
the
truth
because
he
knows
i
would
shield
him
no
matter
what
the
cost
you
simply
want
to
assure
me
of
his
innocence
suggested
kennedy
no
there
was
a
touch
of
scorn
to
the
little
negative
you
believe
him
guilty
you
did
even
when
i
did
then
but
he
knows
something
something
about
the
murder
of
stella
and
he
wo
tell
me
what
it
is
i
i
afraid
for
him
he
is
sleeping
at
night
and
i
believe
he
watching
somebody
at
the
studio
and
i
know
it
the
woman
intuition
professor
she
emphasized
the
word
and
paused
he
in
danger
he
in
some
great
threatening
danger
what
do
you
wish
me
to
do
miss
loring
i
want
you
to
protect
him
and
slowly
she
colored
up
and
around
and
about
her
eyes
as
she
always
did
until
she
was
unlike
an
indian
maid
and
no
one
must
know
i
been
up
to
see
you
gravely
kennedy
bowed
her
to
the
door
assuring
her
he
would
do
all
that
lay
in
his
power
when
he
returned
i
was
ready
for
him
now
i
exclaimed
now
say
it
is
werner
here
is
merle
shirley
watching
some
one
at
the
studio
is
that
likely
to
be
the
director
and
if
shirley
is
watching
werner
you
have
the
explanation
for
the
second
intruder
at
tarrytown
last
night
shirley
is
big
enough
and
strong
enough
to
have
given
the
deputy
a
nice
swift
tussle
a
little
tall
i
afraid
kennedy
remarked
you
ca
go
by
the
deputy
impressions
he
did
really
remember
much
of
anything
certainly
he
was
unobserving
perhaps
you
right
walter
kennedy
smiled
but
how
about
gordon
he
added
there
genuine
motive
money
or
shirley
himself
i
attempted
to
be
sarcastic
there
genuine
motive
stella
made
a
fool
out
of
him
it
was
a
murder
of
passion
kennedy
reminded
me
no
one
in
a
white
heat
of
rage
would
study
up
on
snake
venoms
if
it
were
a
shirley
anger
was
that
kind
but
good
heavens
as
usual
i
arrived
nowhere
in
an
argument
with
kennedy
circumstantial
evidence
points
to
werner
almost
altogether
you
forgotten
one
point
in
your
chain
walter
what
that
whoever
took
the
needle
from
the
curtain
last
night
scratched
himself
on
it
and
left
blood
spots
on
the
portieres
tiny
ones
but
real
blood
spots
nevertheless
that
means
the
intruder
inoculated
himself
with
venom
i
doubt
that
the
poison
was
so
dry
as
to
be
ineffectual
if
it
was
werner
how
do
you
account
for
the
fact
that
he
is
still
alive
do
you
i
guess
my
eyes
went
wide
do
you
expect
to
dig
up
a
dead
man
somewhere
is
there
some
one
we
suspect
and
have
seen
since
yesterday
he
did
answer
preferring
to
tantalize
me
how
do
you
account
for
it
yourself
i
demanded
somewhat
hotly
let
call
it
a
day
walter
he
rejoined
let
go
to
bed
xviii
the
antivenin
i
slept
late
in
the
morning
so
that
kennedy
had
to
wake
me
when
we
had
finished
breakfast
he
led
the
way
to
the
laboratory
all
without
making
any
effort
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
there
he
started
packing
up
the
tubes
and
materials
he
had
been
studying
in
the
case
rather
than
resuming
his
investigations
what
the
idea
i
asked
finally
unable
to
contain
myself
any
longer
you
carry
this
package
he
directed
i
take
the
other
i
obeyed
somewhat
sulkily
i
afraid
you
see
he
added
as
we
left
the
building
and
hurried
to
the
taxi
stand
near
the
campus
the
next
problem
is
to
identify
the
particular
kind
of
venom
that
was
used
besides
i
want
to
know
the
nature
of
the
spots
on
the
towel
you
found
they
certainly
were
not
of
venom
i
have
my
suspicions
what
they
really
are
he
paused
while
we
selected
a
vehicle
and
made
ourselves
comfortable
to
save
time
he
went
on
i
thought
i
just
go
over
to
the
castleton
institute
you
know
in
their
laboratories
the
famous
japanese
investigator
doctor
nagoya
has
made
some
marvelous
discoveries
concerning
the
venom
of
snakes
it
is
his
specialty
a
matter
to
which
he
has
practically
devoted
his
life
therefore
i
expect
that
he
will
be
able
to
confirm
certain
suspicions
of
mine
very
quickly
or
a
shrug
explode
a
theory
which
has
slowly
been
taking
form
in
the
back
of
my
head
when
we
dismissed
the
taxi
in
front
of
the
institute
i
realized
that
this
would
be
my
first
visit
to
this
institution
so
lavishly
endowed
by
the
castleton
for
the
advancement
of
experimental
science
kennedy
card
sent
in
to
doctor
nagoya
brought
that
eminent
investigator
out
personally
to
see
us
he
was
the
very
finest
type
of
oriental
savant
a
member
of
the
intellectual
nobility
of
the
strange
eastern
land
only
recently
made
receptive
to
the
civilization
of
the
west
when
he
and
kennedy
chatted
together
in
low
tones
for
a
few
moments
it
was
hard
for
me
to
grasp
that
each
belonged
to
a
basic
race
strain
fundamentally
different
from
the
other
east
and
west
had
met
upon
the
plane
of
modern
science
the
two
were
simply
men
of
specialized
knowledge
the
japanese
in
one
field
kennedy
in
another
carefully
and
thoroughly
kennedy
and
nagoya
went
over
the
results
which
kennedy
had
already
obtained
after
a
moment
doctor
nagoya
conducted
us
to
his
research
room
now
let
me
show
you
said
the
oriental
in
a
moment
they
were
deep
in
the
mysteries
of
an
even
more
minute
analysis
than
kennedy
had
made
before
i
took
a
turn
about
the
room
finding
nothing
more
understandable
than
the
study
holding
interest
though
i
could
not
grasp
it
curiosity
kept
me
hovering
close
you
see
nagoya
spoke
as
he
finished
the
test
he
was
making
at
the
moment
without
a
doubt
it
is
crotalin
the
venom
of
the
rattlesnake
crotalus
horridus
there
was
no
snake
actually
present
i
hastened
to
explain
breaking
in
then
at
a
glance
from
kennedy
i
stopped
abashed
for
all
this
had
been
made
clear
to
the
scientist
it
is
not
necessary
nagoya
replied
turning
to
me
with
the
politeness
characteristic
of
the
east
crotalin
can
be
obtained
now
with
fair
ease
it
is
a
drug
used
in
a
new
treatment
of
epilepsy
which
is
being
tried
out
at
many
hospitals
i
nodded
my
thanks
not
wanting
to
interrupt
again
kennedy
pressed
on
to
the
next
point
he
wished
established
that
was
the
spot
on
the
portieres
now
the
ampulla
also
crotalin
doctor
nagoya
spoke
positively
how
about
this
solution
kennedy
took
from
my
package
the
tube
with
the
liquid
made
from
the
faint
spots
on
the
towel
which
i
had
found
and
which
had
been
our
first
clue
it
is
not
crotalin
the
japanese
turned
to
his
laboratory
table
kennedy
muttered
some
vague
suggestions
which
were
too
technical
for
me
but
which
seemed
to
enable
nagoya
to
eliminate
a
great
deal
of
work
the
test
progressed
rapidly
finally
the
savant
stepped
back
regarding
the
solution
with
a
very
satisfied
smile
it
is
he
explained
carefully
some
of
the
very
anticrotalus
venin
which
we
have
perfected
right
here
in
the
institute
kennedy
nodded
i
suspected
as
much
there
was
great
elation
in
his
manner
you
see
i
had
heard
all
about
your
wonderful
work
yes
nagoya
waved
his
hand
around
at
the
wonderfully
equipped
room
only
one
detail
in
the
many
arrangements
for
medical
research
made
possible
by
the
generosity
of
castleton
yes
he
repeated
proud
of
his
laboratory
as
he
well
might
be
we
have
made
a
great
deal
of
progress
in
the
development
of
protective
sera
antivenins
we
call
them
are
they
distributed
widely
kennedy
asked
thoughtfully
all
over
the
world
we
are
practically
the
only
source
of
supply
how
do
you
obtain
the
serum
in
quantity
from
horses
treated
with
increasing
doses
of
the
snake
venom
a
question
struck
me
as
i
remembered
the
peculiar
double
action
of
the
poison
can
you
tell
me
just
how
the
antivenin
counteracts
the
effects
of
the
venom
i
inquired
of
the
savant
surely
he
replied
it
neutralizes
one
of
the
two
elements
in
the
venom
the
nervous
poison
thus
enabling
the
individual
to
devote
all
his
vitality
to
overcoming
the
irritant
poison
it
is
the
nervous
poison
that
is
the
chief
agent
producing
paralysis
of
the
heart
and
respiration
we
advise
all
travelers
to
carry
the
protective
serum
if
they
are
likely
to
be
exposed
to
snake
bites
kennedy
picked
up
the
tube
containing
the
solution
made
from
the
towel
spots
this
antivenin
was
your
product
doctor
probably
so
was
the
precise
answer
then
the
purchasers
can
be
identified
i
suggested
we
have
no
record
of
ordinary
purchasers
nagoya
explained
slowly
kennedy
was
keenly
disappointed
at
that
and
showed
it
however
he
thanked
the
scientist
cordially
and
we
departed
outside
he
turned
to
me
do
you
understand
now
why
the
night
intruder
at
tarrytown
did
not
die
if
he
is
one
of
our
suspects
from
the
scratch
of
the
needle
you
mean
he
had
taken
an
injection
of
antivenin
before
exactly
we
are
dealing
with
a
criminal
of
diabolical
cleverness
not
only
did
he
make
all
his
plans
to
kill
miss
lamar
with
the
greatest
possible
care
but
he
prepared
against
accident
to
himself
he
was
taking
no
chances
he
inoculated
himself
with
a
protective
serum
the
needle
of
the
syringe
he
used
for
that
purpose
he
wiped
upon
the
towel
you
discovered
in
the
washroom
xix
around
the
circle
i
like
to
have
another
talk
with
millard
about
that
fortune
features
affair
remarked
kennedy
it
was
the
third
morning
after
the
death
of
stella
lamar
and
i
found
him
half
through
breakfast
when
i
rose
about
him
were
piled
moving
picture
and
theatrical
publications
daily
weekly
and
monthly
at
the
moment
i
caught
him
he
had
spread
wide
open
the
inner
page
of
the
daily
metropolitan
a
sheet
devoted
almost
exclusively
to
sports
and
the
amusement
fields
i
went
around
to
glance
over
his
shoulder
he
pointed
to
a
small
item
under
a
heading
of
recent
plans
and
changes
fortune
features
it
is
hinted
to
the
metropolitan
by
those
in
a
position
to
know
but
who
can
not
yet
be
quoted
that
fortune
features
is
about
to
absorb
a
number
of
the
largest
competing
companies
rumors
of
great
changes
in
the
picture
world
have
been
current
for
some
weeks
and
this
is
the
first
reliable
information
to
be
given
out
it
is
premature
to
give
details
of
the
new
combination
or
to
mention
names
but
fortune
strong
backing
in
wall
street
will
we
are
assured
have
a
stabilizing
influence
at
a
critical
time
in
the
industry
seems
to
be
a
lot
of
hot
air
i
said
there
is
a
name
mentioned
everything
is
those
in
a
position
to
know
and
of
and
is
premature
to
give
details
or
mention
names
bah
kennedy
turned
to
places
he
had
marked
in
several
of
the
other
periodicals
and
papers
and
i
read
them
each
was
substantially
to
the
effect
of
the
note
in
the
metropolitan
although
worded
differently
and
generally
printed
as
a
news
item
it
a
feeler
kennedy
stated
there
something
back
of
it
when
i
caught
the
reference
to
fortune
features
in
the
metropolitan
which
i
been
reading
the
past
two
days
i
sent
the
boy
out
for
every
movie
publication
he
could
find
result
half
a
dozen
repetitions
of
the
hint
that
fortune
is
expanding
that
means
that
it
is
deliberate
publicity
you
think
this
has
something
to
do
with
the
case
i
do
see
the
name
of
manton
mentioned
once
manton
is
a
man
who
seeks
the
front
page
on
every
opportunity
you
remember
of
course
what
millard
told
us
somehow
i
smell
a
rat
if
nothing
else
develops
for
this
morning
i
want
to
find
millard
and
talk
to
him
again
i
believe
manton
is
up
to
something
the
sharp
sound
of
our
buzzer
interrupted
us
because
i
was
on
my
feet
i
went
to
the
door
to
my
amazement
i
found
it
was
phelps
who
was
our
very
early
visitor
i
hope
you
excuse
this
intrusion
he
apologized
to
kennedy
pushing
by
me
with
the
rudeness
which
seemed
inherent
in
the
man
then
he
recognized
the
sheet
still
spread
out
on
the
table
i
see
you
too
have
been
reading
the
metropolitan
yes
kennedy
admitted
languidly
there
is
nothing
about
manton
pictures
though
manton
pictures
hell
in
an
instant
phelps
exploded
and
the
thin
veneer
of
politeness
was
gone
with
a
shaking
finger
he
pointed
to
the
item
which
we
had
just
been
reading
and
discussing
did
you
read
that
did
you
see
the
reference
to
stabilizing
the
industry
stabilizing
it
ought
to
be
spelled
for
they
lead
all
the
donkeys
into
stalls
and
tie
them
up
and
let
them
kick
he
stopped
momentarily
for
sheer
inability
to
continue
i
suppose
you
do
know
manton
is
behind
this
fortune
features
we
were
aware
of
the
fact
kennedy
told
him
quietly
phelps
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
keenly
as
if
he
had
thought
to
surprise
us
and
had
been
disappointed
nervously
he
began
to
pace
the
floor
perhaps
you
know
also
that
things
have
been
going
just
right
with
manton
pictures
kennedy
straightened
when
i
asked
you
at
tarrytown
just
two
mornings
ago
whether
there
was
any
trouble
between
manton
and
yourself
you
answered
that
there
was
not
phelps
flushed
i
did
want
to
air
my
financial
difficulties
with
manton
my
my
answer
was
truthful
the
way
you
meant
your
question
manton
and
i
have
had
no
words
no
quarrel
no
disagreement
of
a
personal
nature
what
is
the
trouble
with
manton
pictures
they
are
wasting
money
throwing
it
right
and
left
that
pay
roll
of
theirs
is
preposterous
the
waste
itself
is
beyond
belief
sometimes
four
and
five
cameras
on
a
scene
retakes
upon
the
slightest
provocation
even
sets
rebuilt
because
some
minor
detail
fails
to
suit
the
artistic
eye
of
the
director
werner
supposed
to
watch
all
the
companies
does
half
know
his
business
in
the
making
of
a
film
they
will
overtake
sometimes
as
much
as
eighty
or
a
hundred
thousand
feet
of
negative
in
each
of
two
cameras
when
twenty
thousand
is
enough
overtake
for
anyone
that
alone
is
five
to
ten
thousand
dollars
for
negative
stock
almost
fifteen
with
the
sample
print
and
developing
and
the
cost
of
stock
kennedy
is
the
smallest
item
all
the
extra
length
is
long
additional
weeks
of
pay
roll
and
overhead
expense
i
put
an
auditor
and
a
film
expert
on
the
accounts
of
stella
lamar
last
picture
by
their
figures
just
thousand
dollars
was
absolutely
thrown
away
kennedy
rose
folding
the
newspaper
carefully
while
he
collected
his
thoughts
my
dear
phelps
he
stated
finally
that
is
simply
inefficiency
i
doubt
if
it
is
anything
criminal
certainly
there
is
no
connection
with
the
death
of
stella
lamar
my
only
interest
in
manton
pictures
phelps
was
very
grave
there
is
every
connection
with
the
death
of
stella
lamar
what
do
you
mean
kennedy
what
i
going
to
say
to
you
i
can
not
substantiate
in
any
court
of
law
furthermore
i
laying
myself
open
to
action
for
libel
so
i
must
not
be
quoted
but
i
want
you
to
understand
that
stella
was
inescapably
wound
up
with
all
of
manton
financial
schemes
his
money
maneuvers
determined
her
social
life
her
friends
everything
she
was
then
as
enid
faye
will
be
now
his
his
decoy
manton
has
no
scruples
of
any
sort
whatsoever
he
is
dishonest
tricky
a
liar
and
a
cheat
if
i
could
prove
it
i
would
tell
him
so
but
he
too
clever
for
me
i
do
know
however
that
he
pulled
the
strings
which
controlled
every
move
stella
lamar
ever
made
when
she
went
to
dinner
with
me
it
was
because
manton
wished
her
to
do
so
she
was
his
right
hand
his
ears
almost
his
mouth
i
have
no
doubt
but
that
her
death
is
the
direct
result
of
some
business
deal
of
his
something
directly
to
do
with
his
financial
necessities
kennedy
did
not
glance
up
those
are
very
serious
assertions
it
is
a
very
serious
matter
to
show
how
unscrupulous
manton
is
i
can
demonstrate
that
he
is
wrecking
manton
pictures
deliberately
i
told
you
of
the
waste
only
the
other
day
i
came
into
the
studio
werner
was
putting
up
a
great
ballroom
set
you
saw
it
no
that
is
the
one
i
mean
i
mean
the
first
one
he
had
it
all
up
then
some
little
thing
did
suit
him
the
next
day
i
came
in
again
all
struck
sloughed
every
bit
of
it
and
a
new
one
started
i
said
think
a
minute
that
my
money
what
good
did
it
do
he
even
began
to
alter
the
new
set
he
would
only
go
on
encouraging
werner
and
the
other
directors
to
change
their
sets
to
lose
time
in
trying
for
foolish
effects
anything
at
all
to
pad
the
expense
you
think
i
am
romancing
but
you
do
understand
the
film
world
phelps
hurried
on
angrily
do
you
know
that
enid
faye
contract
is
not
with
manton
pictures
but
with
manton
himself
that
means
he
can
take
her
away
from
me
after
he
has
made
her
a
star
with
my
money
at
my
expense
why
should
he
wreck
manton
pictures
you
ask
do
you
know
that
bit
by
bit
on
the
pretext
that
he
needed
the
funds
for
this
that
or
the
other
thing
manton
has
sold
out
his
entire
interest
in
the
company
to
me
it
is
all
mine
now
i
tell
you
complained
phelps
bitterly
he
could
seem
to
wreck
the
company
fast
enough
why
do
you
realize
that
there
is
room
both
for
this
older
company
and
the
new
fortune
features
can
you
see
that
if
manton
pictures
fails
the
fortune
company
will
be
able
to
pick
up
the
studio
and
all
the
equipment
for
a
song
i
the
fall
guy
and
yet
kennedy
all
the
efforts
to
wreck
manton
pictures
would
have
failed
because
black
terror
was
too
sure
a
success
in
spite
of
all
the
expense
in
spite
of
every
effort
to
wreck
it
that
picture
would
have
made
half
a
million
dollars
stella
acting
and
story
and
script
would
have
put
it
over
but
now
millard
contract
has
expired
and
manton
has
signed
him
for
fortune
features
enid
faye
will
be
made
a
star
by
black
terror
but
she
is
not
now
the
drawing
power
to
put
it
over
big
as
stella
would
have
done
i
tell
you
kennedy
the
death
of
stella
lamar
has
completed
the
wreck
of
manton
pictures
kennedy
jumped
to
his
feet
there
was
a
hard
light
in
his
eyes
i
had
never
seen
before
do
i
understand
you
phelps
he
snapped
are
you
accusing
manton
of
the
murder
of
stella
lamar
to
further
various
financial
schemes
hardly
phelps
blanched
a
bit
and
i
thought
that
a
shudder
swept
over
him
i
do
mean
anything
like
that
at
all
what
i
mean
is
that
manton
in
encouraging
various
sorts
of
dissension
to
wreck
the
company
inadvertently
fanned
the
flames
of
passion
of
those
about
her
and
it
resulted
in
her
death
who
killed
her
i
do
know
grudgingly
i
admitted
that
this
seemed
open
and
frank
at
tarrytown
kennedy
went
on
i
asked
you
if
stella
lamar
was
making
any
trouble
had
threatened
to
quit
manton
pictures
and
you
said
no
is
that
still
your
answer
for
several
months
she
had
been
that
was
not
because
she
wanted
to
make
trouble
but
because
she
had
fallen
in
love
manton
found
he
could
handle
her
as
he
had
previously
do
you
suspect
manton
of
killing
her
himself
i
do
suspect
anyone
that
is
an
honest
answer
mr
kennedy
what
do
you
know
about
fortune
features
the
banker
eye
fell
on
the
newspaper
again
i
know
who
this
new
wall
street
fellow
is
i
got
my
scouts
out
working
for
me
leigh
that
who
it
is
and
i
sore
i
have
a
right
to
be
phelps
was
getting
more
and
more
heated
by
the
moment
i
tell
you
he
almost
shouted
this
fake
movie
business
is
the
modern
game
all
right
never
again
i
was
amazed
at
the
machiavellian
cleverness
of
manton
here
he
was
on
one
hand
openly
working
with
yet
secretly
ruining
the
manton
pictures
while
on
the
other
hand
he
was
covertly
building
up
the
competing
fortune
features
kennedy
paced
out
into
the
little
hall
of
our
suite
and
back
he
faced
our
visitor
once
more
why
did
you
come
to
see
me
this
morning
at
our
last
encounter
you
may
recall
you
said
you
wished
you
could
throw
me
down
the
steps
phelps
smiled
ruefully
that
was
a
mistake
it
was
the
way
i
felt
but
i
sorry
now
again
the
black
clouds
overshadowed
the
features
of
the
financier
now
i
want
you
to
bring
out
and
prove
the
things
i
told
you
the
malice
showed
in
his
voice
plainly
for
the
first
time
i
want
it
proved
in
court
that
manton
is
a
cheap
crook
when
you
uncover
the
murderer
of
stella
lamar
you
will
find
that
the
moral
responsibility
for
her
death
traces
right
back
to
lloyd
manton
i
want
him
driven
out
of
the
business
kennedy
attitude
changed
as
he
escorted
phelps
to
the
door
his
tones
were
anything
of
the
sort
is
beyond
my
province
my
task
is
simply
to
find
the
person
who
killed
the
girl
when
the
financier
was
gone
i
turned
to
kennedy
eagerly
what
do
you
think
i
asked
i
think
more
than
ever
that
we
should
investigate
fortune
features
let
have
a
look
at
the
telephone
book
there
was
no
studio
of
the
new
corporation
in
new
york
but
we
did
find
one
listed
in
new
jersey
just
across
the
river
at
fort
lee
we
walked
from
the
university
down
the
hill
and
over
to
the
ferry
on
the
other
side
a
ten
minutes
ride
took
us
to
our
destination
facing
us
was
a
huge
structure
set
down
in
the
midst
of
a
little
park
inquiry
for
manton
brought
no
response
whatever
rather
surprise
that
we
should
be
asking
for
him
here
however
i
reflected
that
that
was
exactly
what
we
ought
to
expect
if
manton
was
working
under
cover
the
girl
at
the
telephone
switchboard
smiling
at
kennedy
had
a
suggestion
they
taking
a
storm
exterior
down
in
the
meadow
she
explained
perhaps
he
down
there
among
the
visitors
or
perhaps
someone
who
will
be
able
to
give
you
some
information
i
glanced
outdoors
at
the
brightly
shining
sun
a
storm
i
repeated
incredulously
yes
she
smiled
it
might
interest
you
to
see
it
following
her
directions
we
started
across
country
leaving
the
studio
building
some
distance
behind
and
entering
a
broad
expanse
of
meadow
beyond
a
thin
clump
of
trees
at
the
farther
end
we
could
see
a
large
group
of
people
and
paraphernalia
which
at
the
distance
we
could
not
make
out
however
it
was
not
long
after
we
emerged
from
the
trees
that
we
perceived
they
were
photographing
squarely
in
our
direction
several
began
waving
their
arms
wildly
at
us
and
shouting
kennedy
and
i
understanding
turned
and
advanced
keeping
well
out
of
the
camera
lines
along
the
edge
of
the
field
hello
a
voice
greeted
us
as
we
approached
the
group
standing
back
and
watching
the
action
to
my
surprise
it
was
millard
with
the
spectators
i
looked
about
for
manton
but
did
not
see
him
nor
anyone
else
we
knew
it
a
storm
and
cyclone
said
millard
his
attention
rather
on
what
was
going
on
than
on
us
for
the
moment
we
said
nothing
the
scene
before
us
was
indeed
interesting
half
a
dozen
aeroplane
engines
and
propellers
had
been
set
up
outside
the
picture
and
anchored
securely
in
place
the
wind
from
them
was
actually
enough
to
knock
a
man
down
rain
was
furnished
by
hose
playing
water
into
the
whirling
blades
sending
it
driving
into
the
scene
with
the
fury
of
a
tropical
storm
back
of
the
propellers
half
a
dozen
men
were
frantically
at
work
shoveling
into
them
sand
and
dirt
creating
an
amazingly
realistic
cyclone
we
arrived
in
the
midst
of
the
cyclone
scene
as
the
dust
storm
was
ending
and
the
torrential
rain
succeeded
for
the
storm
a
miniature
village
had
been
constructed
in
fashion
partially
sawed
through
and
tricked
for
the
proper
moment
many
objects
were
controlled
by
invisible
wires
including
an
actual
horse
and
buggy
which
seemed
to
be
lifted
bodily
and
carried
away
roofs
flew
off
walls
crashed
in
actors
and
actresses
were
knocked
flat
as
some
few
of
them
failed
to
gain
their
cyclone
cellars
altogether
it
was
a
storm
of
such
efficiency
as
nature
herself
could
scarcely
have
furnished
and
all
staged
with
the
streaming
sunlight
which
made
photography
possible
pandemonium
reigned
cameras
were
grinding
directors
were
bawling
through
megaphones
all
was
calculated
chaos
yet
it
took
only
a
glance
to
see
that
some
marvelous
effects
were
being
caught
here
at
the
conclusion
i
recognized
suddenly
the
little
leading
lady
it
was
the
girl
we
had
seen
with
manton
at
jacques
cabaret
that
the
way
to
take
a
picture
exclaimed
millard
everything
right
no
expense
spared
i
came
over
to
see
it
done
it
wonderful
yes
was
kennedy
answer
but
it
must
be
very
costly
it
is
all
of
that
said
millard
but
what
of
it
if
the
film
makes
a
big
i
would
have
missed
this
for
anything
werner
never
staged
a
spectacle
like
this
in
his
life
fortune
features
are
going
to
set
a
new
mark
in
pictures
but
can
they
keep
it
up
have
they
the
money
millard
shrugged
his
shoulders
manton
pictures
ca
that
a
cinch
phelps
has
reached
the
end
of
his
rope
i
guess
i
afraid
the
trouble
with
him
was
that
he
was
thinking
of
too
many
things
besides
pictures
there
was
no
mistaking
the
meaning
of
the
remark
millard
was
still
cut
by
stella
desertion
of
him
for
the
broker
i
caught
kennedy
glance
but
neither
of
us
cared
to
refer
to
her
where
can
i
find
manton
now
kennedy
asked
did
you
try
his
office
at
seven
hundred
and
was
millard
suggestion
no
i
wanted
to
see
this
place
first
well
you
most
likely
find
him
there
i
got
to
go
back
to
the
city
scenes
of
black
terror
to
rewrite
to
fit
enid
better
i
motor
you
across
the
ferry
and
to
the
subway
at
the
subway
station
millard
left
us
and
we
proceeded
to
executive
offices
in
a
seventh
avenue
skyscraper
built
for
and
devoted
exclusively
to
the
film
business
manton
business
suite
was
lavishly
furnished
but
not
quite
as
ornate
and
garish
as
his
apartment
the
promoter
himself
welcomed
us
for
no
matter
how
busy
he
was
at
any
hour
he
always
seemed
to
have
time
to
stop
and
chat
well
how
goes
it
he
pushed
over
a
box
of
expensive
cigars
have
you
found
out
anything
yet
had
a
visit
from
phelps
this
morning
kennedy
plunged
directly
into
the
subject
watching
the
effect
manton
did
not
betray
anything
except
a
quiet
smile
poor
old
phelps
he
said
i
guess
he
pretty
uneasy
you
know
he
has
been
speculating
rather
heavily
in
the
market
lately
there
was
a
time
when
i
thought
phelps
had
a
bank
roll
in
reserve
but
it
seems
he
has
been
playing
the
game
on
a
shoestring
after
all
manton
casually
flicked
the
ashes
from
his
cigar
into
a
highly
polished
cuspidor
as
he
leaned
over
i
happen
to
have
learned
that
to
make
his
bluff
good
he
has
been
taking
money
from
his
brokerage
business
here
he
nodded
sagely
his
customers
accounts
you
know
leigh
knows
the
inside
of
everybody
affairs
in
wall
street
they
say
a
quarter
of
a
million
is
short
at
least
to
tell
you
the
truth
poor
stella
took
a
good
deal
of
phelps
money
certainly
his
manton
pictures
holdings
would
leave
him
in
the
hole
as
deep
as
all
that
i
reflected
that
this
was
quite
the
way
of
the
world
first
framing
up
something
on
a
boob
then
deprecating
the
ease
with
which
he
was
trimmed
was
it
blackmail
stella
had
levied
on
phelps
i
wondered
was
she
taking
from
him
to
give
to
gordon
had
stella
broken
him
was
she
the
real
cause
of
the
tangle
in
his
affairs
and
had
phelps
in
insane
passion
revenged
himself
on
her
in
the
conversation
with
manton
there
was
certainly
no
hint
of
answer
to
my
queries
with
all
his
ease
manton
was
the
true
picture
promoter
seldom
was
he
betrayed
into
a
positive
statement
of
his
own
always
when
necessary
he
gave
as
authority
the
name
of
some
one
else
but
the
effect
was
the
same
a
hurried
call
of
some
sort
took
manton
away
from
us
kennedy
turned
to
me
with
a
whimsical
expression
let
go
he
remarked
what
do
you
make
of
it
offhand
i
asked
outside
we
going
about
in
a
circle
he
remarked
strange
group
of
people
each
apparently
suspects
the
other
and
to
cover
himself
talks
of
the
other
fellow
i
added
kennedy
nodded
and
we
made
our
way
toward
the
laboratory
i
bet
something
happens
before
the
day
is
over
i
hazarded
for
no
reason
in
particular
kennedy
shrugged
as
we
went
i
cast
up
in
my
mind
the
facts
we
had
learned
the
information
from
manton
was
disconcerting
coming
on
top
of
what
had
already
been
revealed
about
the
inner
workings
of
his
game
if
phelps
had
secretly
borrowed
from
the
trust
accounts
in
his
charge
a
quarter
of
a
million
or
so
i
saw
that
his
situation
must
indeed
be
desperate
to
what
lengths
he
might
go
it
was
difficult
to
determine
xx
the
banquet
scene
for
once
i
qualified
as
a
prophet
we
were
hardly
in
our
rooms
when
the
telephone
rang
for
kennedy
it
was
mackay
calling
in
from
tarrytown
my
men
have
positive
identification
of
one
of
the
visitors
to
the
phelps
home
the
night
after
the
murder
he
reported
fine
exclaimed
kennedy
who
was
it
how
did
you
uncover
his
trail
you
remember
that
my
deputy
heard
the
sound
of
a
departing
automobile
well
we
have
been
questioning
everyone
a
citizen
here
who
returned
home
late
at
just
about
that
hour
remembers
seeing
a
taxicab
tearing
through
the
street
at
a
reckless
rate
he
came
in
to
see
me
this
morning
he
made
a
mental
note
of
the
license
number
at
the
time
and
while
nothing
stuck
with
him
but
the
last
three
figures
three
sixes
he
was
sure
that
it
was
a
maroon
taxi
we
got
busy
and
have
located
the
driver
who
made
the
trip
from
a
stand
at
all
the
way
out
and
back
on
the
return
he
dropped
his
fare
at
the
man
apartment
the
identification
is
positive
who
is
it
kennedy
became
quite
excited
werner
the
director
werner
in
surprise
what
are
you
going
to
do
arrest
him
first
examine
him
afterward
i
sworn
out
the
warrant
already
and
i
going
to
start
in
by
car
just
as
soon
as
we
hang
up
i
thought
i
phone
you
first
in
case
you
wanted
to
accompany
me
to
the
studio
we
hurry
there
kennedy
replied
and
meet
you
outside
no
up
on
the
floor
you
be
there
fifteen
minutes
to
half
an
hour
ahead
of
me
i
hope
there
is
no
way
for
anyone
to
tip
him
off
so
he
can
escape
we
stop
him
if
he
attempts
it
good
the
courtyard
of
the
studio
of
manton
pictures
incorporated
was
about
the
same
as
upon
the
occasions
of
our
previous
visits
except
that
i
detected
a
larger
number
of
cars
parked
in
the
inclosure
including
a
number
of
very
fine
ones
also
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
a
greater
absence
of
life
than
usual
as
though
something
of
particular
interest
had
taken
everyone
inside
the
buildings
the
gateman
informed
us
that
werner
was
working
the
large
studio
we
made
our
way
up
through
the
structure
containing
the
dressing
rooms
and
found
the
proper
door
without
difficulty
when
we
passed
through
under
the
big
glass
roof
we
grasped
the
reason
for
the
lack
of
interest
in
the
other
departments
about
the
quadrangle
here
everyone
was
gathered
to
watch
the
taking
of
the
banquet
scene
for
the
black
terror
the
huge
set
was
illuminated
brightly
and
packed
thronged
with
people
it
was
a
marvelous
set
in
many
ways
to
carry
out
the
illusion
of
size
and
to
aid
in
the
deceptive
additional
length
given
by
the
mirrors
at
the
farther
end
werner
had
decided
against
the
usual
one
large
table
arranged
but
had
substituted
instead
a
great
number
of
individual
smaller
tables
about
which
he
had
grouped
the
various
guests
the
placing
of
those
nearest
the
mirrors
had
been
so
arranged
as
to
give
no
double
images
thus
betraying
the
trick
the
waiters
all
the
characters
who
walked
about
were
kept
near
the
front
toward
the
cameras
for
the
same
reason
it
seemed
as
if
the
banquet
hall
was
at
least
twice
its
actual
size
i
saw
that
millard
had
arrived
ahead
of
us
either
the
changing
of
the
scenes
in
his
script
to
fit
enid
had
not
taken
him
very
long
or
else
the
photographing
of
this
particular
bit
of
action
had
proved
sufficiently
fascinating
to
draw
him
away
from
his
work
i
wondered
at
first
if
he
had
come
to
the
studio
to
use
his
office
here
an
infrequent
happening
from
manton
account
then
i
realized
that
he
was
in
evening
dress
without
doubt
he
planned
to
play
a
minor
part
in
the
banquet
his
presence
was
no
accident
then
i
picked
out
manton
himself
from
our
point
of
observation
in
a
quiet
corner
selected
by
kennedy
for
that
purpose
it
was
evident
that
the
promoter
had
cleared
up
his
business
at
the
office
rapidly
since
we
had
left
him
there
to
go
to
our
quarters
on
the
heights
and
had
departed
immediately
from
the
latter
place
so
as
to
precede
the
district
attorney
here
manton
as
well
as
millard
was
in
evening
dress
a
moment
later
i
recognized
phelps
and
he
too
wore
his
formal
clothes
in
an
instant
i
grasped
that
werner
actually
was
saving
money
not
only
were
these
officials
of
the
company
present
to
help
fill
up
the
tables
but
i
was
able
now
to
pick
out
a
number
of
the
guests
who
were
uneasy
in
their
and
more
or
less
out
of
place
in
attire
they
certainly
were
not
actors
one
girl
i
definitely
placed
as
the
stenographer
from
manton
waiting
room
at
the
studio
then
other
things
caught
my
attention
i
could
not
help
but
doubt
the
stories
of
waste
told
us
by
phelps
as
i
looked
over
the
scene
before
me
the
use
of
the
mirrors
to
avoid
building
the
full
length
of
the
floor
did
not
seem
to
fit
in
with
the
theory
that
manton
and
werner
were
making
every
effort
to
wreck
the
company
deliberately
i
watched
the
financier
for
several
moments
but
did
not
detect
anything
from
his
manner
except
that
he
seemed
to
feel
ill
at
ease
and
awkward
in
i
picked
out
millard
again
and
this
time
found
him
talking
with
enid
faye
and
gordon
immediately
i
sensed
a
dramatic
conflict
carefully
suppressed
but
having
too
many
of
the
outward
indications
to
fool
anyone
in
fact
a
child
would
have
observed
that
lawrence
millard
and
the
leading
man
needed
little
urging
to
engage
in
a
scuffle
then
and
there
though
stella
lamar
was
dead
this
was
the
heritage
she
had
left
her
touch
had
embittered
two
men
beyond
the
point
of
reconciliation
the
husband
who
had
been
and
the
husband
who
was
to
be
of
the
two
millard
had
far
the
better
control
of
himself
however
after
a
brief
word
or
so
gordon
left
them
at
once
i
could
see
the
relief
in
the
expressions
of
both
the
others
again
i
wondered
just
what
might
be
between
these
two
it
was
an
easy
familiarity
which
might
have
been
as
casual
as
it
seemed
to
be
no
more
or
which
might
have
been
a
mask
for
something
far
deeper
and
more
enduring
the
schooled
outer
cloak
of
an
inner
perfect
understanding
werner
was
by
far
the
busiest
of
those
waiting
in
the
stifling
heat
beneath
the
glass
roof
he
was
in
evening
dress
prepared
to
take
his
own
place
before
the
camera
and
in
straight
so
that
he
looked
nothing
like
the
slain
millionaire
the
part
he
had
played
in
the
opening
scenes
i
saw
that
he
was
a
master
in
the
art
of
i
was
sure
that
he
was
more
nervous
than
usual
it
struck
me
that
he
needed
the
stimulus
of
the
drug
he
used
although
later
i
knew
that
he
must
have
felt
intuitively
the
coming
of
events
which
followed
close
upon
the
attempt
to
photograph
the
action
as
more
of
the
people
hurried
up
from
the
offices
and
around
from
the
manuscript
and
other
departments
very
conscious
of
their
formal
attire
and
as
the
regular
players
changed
and
adjusted
the
of
these
amateurs
the
banquet
took
on
the
proportions
of
a
real
affair
the
members
of
the
cast
were
placed
at
the
table
in
the
foreground
enid
gordon
marilyn
and
a
fourth
man
were
assigned
locations
after
which
werner
proceeded
to
fill
the
seats
in
the
rear
with
the
exception
of
millard
and
phelps
none
of
the
inexperienced
people
were
allowed
to
face
the
camera
manton
whose
features
were
familiar
through
published
interviews
in
many
publicity
campaigns
was
placed
to
one
side
opposite
phelps
millard
was
given
charge
of
a
group
containing
a
number
of
giddy
extra
girls
in
somewhat
diaphanous
costume
and
seemed
to
be
in
his
element
the
tables
themselves
were
prepared
with
perfect
taste
i
could
see
that
real
food
was
being
used
in
order
to
achieve
a
greater
degree
of
realism
for
a
caterer
had
set
up
a
buffet
some
distance
out
of
the
scene
from
which
to
serve
the
courses
called
for
in
the
script
many
of
the
dishes
were
being
kept
hot
the
steam
curling
from
beneath
the
covers
in
appetizing
wisps
the
wine
supposed
to
be
champagne
was
sparkling
apple
juice
of
the
best
quality
and
i
do
doubt
but
that
before
the
days
of
prohibition
werner
would
have
insisted
upon
the
real
fizz
water
in
details
such
as
these
the
director
was
showing
no
economy
all
ready
now
werner
called
stepping
back
to
a
place
at
a
table
which
he
had
reserved
for
himself
all
set
remember
the
action
of
the
script
instantly
the
buzz
of
conversation
died
and
everyone
turned
to
him
no
no
no
he
exclaimed
in
vexation
do
go
dead
on
your
feet
this
is
a
banquet
you
are
having
a
good
time
it
not
a
funeral
you
were
all
in
just
the
right
state
of
mind
before
and
you
do
have
to
stop
and
gape
to
listen
to
me
keep
right
on
talking
and
laughing
my
voice
will
carry
and
you
can
hear
without
getting
out
of
your
parts
i
turned
to
kennedy
to
see
how
the
struck
him
i
saw
that
he
was
watching
the
two
girls
at
the
forward
table
closely
and
so
i
faced
about
to
follow
his
glance
marilyn
face
was
red
with
anger
while
enid
calm
and
rather
malicious
was
ignoring
her
to
devote
all
attention
to
gordon
the
leading
man
bored
and
irritated
made
no
effort
to
conceal
a
heavy
scowl
in
the
momentary
interval
following
werner
instructions
marilyn
lost
all
control
of
herself
if
you
will
pardon
me
miss
faye
she
cried
out
in
a
voice
which
carried
over
to
us
and
with
cutting
accent
upon
the
miss
i
think
that
in
this
scene
at
least
we
should
both
be
facing
the
camera
if
i
understand
the
scene
in
the
script
at
all
it
is
intended
to
show
the
conflict
between
the
two
women
over
the
one
man
seated
between
them
jack
daring
is
to
be
swayed
first
by
stella
remsen
then
by
zelda
at
least
this
once
i
think
the
daughter
of
old
remsen
and
his
ward
are
playing
roles
of
equal
importance
for
a
moment
i
smiled
realizing
that
marilyn
was
not
going
to
let
enid
take
the
picture
away
from
her
as
we
had
seen
the
new
star
do
in
one
of
her
first
scenes
with
the
leading
man
then
i
sobered
realizing
that
it
was
the
outer
reflection
of
the
passion
of
these
people
the
cloud
of
stella
death
was
over
them
still
enid
responded
but
in
tones
too
low
for
us
to
hear
a
new
flush
of
red
in
marilyn
face
however
demonstrated
the
power
in
the
lash
of
the
other
girl
tongue
werner
hurried
over
to
them
not
masking
his
own
irritation
any
too
well
without
a
word
he
began
rearranging
the
table
moving
it
slightly
so
that
while
there
was
no
great
difference
in
its
position
he
had
yet
made
a
show
of
satisfying
marilyn
in
effect
he
pleased
neither
the
two
pretty
faces
closest
to
the
camera
were
a
study
in
discontent
i
do
wonder
that
directors
are
nervous
kennedy
remarked
film
manufacture
must
keep
everyone
under
constant
tension
what
do
you
make
of
the
feeling
between
the
different
people
i
asked
did
you
notice
millard
and
gordon
and
now
enid
and
marilyn
there
something
under
cover
he
rejoined
something
behind
all
this
i
get
the
impression
that
our
suspects
are
watching
one
another
like
as
many
hawks
at
various
times
most
of
them
have
glanced
over
at
us
they
know
we
are
here
and
are
conscious
they
may
be
under
suspicion
therefore
i
particularly
want
to
see
how
those
two
girls
act
when
mackay
arrives
to
arrest
werner
the
director
stepping
back
to
his
place
took
a
megaphone
from
his
assistant
for
use
in
the
rehearsal
now
you
must
act
just
as
though
this
were
a
real
banquet
he
shouted
try
to
forget
that
the
black
terror
is
lurking
outside
the
window
that
an
attack
is
coming
from
him
remember
when
the
shot
is
fired
you
must
all
leap
up
as
though
you
meant
it
here
you
you
you
designating
certain
extra
girls
faint
when
it
happens
that
not
until
after
the
toast
is
proposed
i
propose
the
toast
from
my
table
and
it
will
be
the
cue
for
shirley
outside
now
do
get
ahead
of
the
action
you
amateurs
do
turn
around
to
see
if
the
camera
is
working
we
go
through
the
action
up
to
the
moment
i
propose
the
toast
the
buzz
of
conversation
rose
slightly
as
though
an
effort
was
being
put
into
the
gayety
i
glanced
about
at
some
of
the
people
who
were
cast
for
only
this
one
scene
wishing
i
could
read
lips
because
i
was
sure
many
of
them
talked
of
matters
wholly
out
of
place
in
this
setting
at
the
same
time
i
kept
an
eye
on
the
principals
and
upon
werner
finally
the
director
was
satisfied
after
a
second
rehearsal
all
right
he
bellowed
throwing
the
megaphone
from
the
scene
shoot
at
the
same
instant
he
dropped
to
his
place
and
apparently
was
a
guest
with
no
interest
but
in
the
food
and
wine
before
him
at
the
were
three
of
assistant
director
kept
a
careful
watch
of
the
general
action
in
actual
time
by
the
watch
the
whole
was
very
short
a
second
measuring
to
sixteen
pictures
or
a
foot
of
film
as
i
explained
afterward
to
kennedy
the
entire
scene
perhaps
ran
one
hundred
or
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
but
on
the
screen
even
to
the
spectators
in
the
studio
the
illusion
in
a
scene
of
the
kind
would
be
the
duration
of
half
an
hour
or
even
more
this
would
be
helped
by
of
the
individual
action
especially
by
the
byplay
between
the
principals
taken
later
and
inserted
into
the
long
shot
by
the
film
cutter
i
know
i
was
carried
away
by
a
sense
of
reality
it
seemed
to
me
that
waiters
made
endless
trips
to
and
fro
that
here
and
there
pretty
girls
broke
into
laughter
constantly
or
that
men
leaned
forward
every
other
moment
to
make
witty
remarks
in
fact
i
felt
genuinely
sorry
i
could
not
take
part
in
the
festivities
i
knew
that
danger
in
the
person
of
the
black
terror
as
played
by
shirley
lurked
just
out
the
window
i
felt
delicious
anticipatory
thrills
of
fear
so
thoroughly
was
i
in
the
spirit
of
the
thing
then
i
saw
that
werner
was
about
to
propose
the
toast
about
to
give
the
cue
for
the
big
action
watch
him
whispered
kennedy
he
an
actor
he
taking
that
drink
just
as
though
he
meant
every
drop
of
it
werner
had
raised
his
delicately
stemmed
glass
as
though
to
join
his
neighbor
in
some
pledge
when
a
new
idea
seemed
to
strike
him
he
leaped
to
his
feet
let
drink
together
let
drink
to
our
hero
and
heroine
of
the
evening
other
voices
rose
in
acclamation
the
wine
had
been
poured
lavishly
glasses
clinked
and
we
could
hear
laughter
suddenly
at
the
window
back
of
everyone
appeared
the
evil
figure
of
shirley
eyes
glittering
menacingly
from
their
slits
two
weapons
glistening
blue
in
his
hands
at
the
same
moment
there
was
a
terrible
groan
followed
by
a
scream
of
agony
werner
staggered
back
his
left
hand
clutched
at
his
breast
from
his
right
hand
the
glass
which
he
had
drained
fell
to
the
canvas
covered
floor
with
an
ominous
dull
crash
this
was
not
in
the
script
practically
everybody
realized
the
fact
for
the
scene
instantly
was
in
an
uproar
in
the
general
consternation
no
one
seemed
to
know
just
what
to
do
shirley
was
the
first
to
act
the
first
to
realize
what
had
happened
dropping
his
weapons
reaching
the
side
of
the
stricken
director
in
one
leap
he
supported
him
as
he
reeled
drunkenly
then
eased
him
to
the
floor
behind
us
before
i
could
look
to
kennedy
to
see
what
he
would
do
there
was
the
gasp
of
a
man
out
of
breath
from
hurrying
upstairs
i
turned
startled
it
was
mackay
shall
i
make
the
collar
he
wheezed
at
the
same
instant
he
saw
the
gathering
crowd
in
the
set
what
what
happened
he
asked
kennedy
had
bounded
forward
only
a
few
seconds
after
shirley
as
i
pushed
through
after
him
mackay
following
i
discovered
him
kneeling
at
the
side
of
werner
some
one
send
for
a
doctor
quick
he
commanded
taking
charge
of
things
as
a
matter
of
course
hurry
he
repeated
he
gasping
for
air
and
it
be
too
late
in
a
minute
then
he
saw
us
walter
mackay
he
raised
werner
head
push
everyone
back
please
give
him
a
chance
to
breathe
a
thousand
thoughts
flashed
through
my
head
as
politely
but
firmly
i
widened
the
space
about
kennedy
and
the
director
was
this
a
case
of
suicide
had
werner
known
we
were
coming
for
him
had
he
thought
to
bring
about
his
own
end
in
the
most
spectacular
fashion
possible
was
this
the
fancy
of
a
brain
suddenly
i
realized
that
werner
was
trying
to
speak
one
of
the
camera
men
had
helped
kennedy
lift
him
to
the
top
of
a
table
swept
of
its
dishes
and
linen
so
as
to
make
it
easier
for
him
to
breathe
out
in
tarrytown
he
muttered
weakly
that
night
i
suspected
and
saw
his
voice
trailed
off
into
nothingness
even
the
motion
of
his
lips
was
too
feeble
to
follow
in
an
instant
i
grasped
the
cruel
injustice
i
had
done
this
man
in
my
mind
it
was
now
that
i
remembered
in
a
flash
kennedy
attitude
and
was
glad
that
kennedy
had
not
suspected
him
see
i
faced
mackay
speaking
in
quick
low
tones
so
the
others
could
not
hear
i
we
have
been
totally
and
absolutely
wrong
in
suspecting
werner
instead
it
was
he
who
has
been
playing
our
game
trying
to
confirm
his
own
suspicions
i
been
entirely
wrong
in
my
deductions
from
the
discovery
of
his
dope
and
needles
what
do
you
mean
jameson
the
district
attorney
had
been
taken
completely
off
his
feet
by
the
unexpected
developments
his
eyes
were
rather
dazed
his
expression
baffled
what
do
you
mean
why
he
was
out
at
tarrytown
that
night
all
right
do
you
see
but
but
he
was
the
second
man
the
man
who
watched
mackay
still
seemed
unable
to
comprehend
there
were
two
men
i
went
on
excitedly
covering
my
own
chagrin
in
my
impatience
at
the
little
district
attorney
the
one
your
deputy
struggled
with
was
short
rather
than
tall
and
very
strong
werner
ca
you
see
it
have
you
noticed
how
stockily
and
powerfully
the
director
is
built
werner
must
really
have
had
some
clue
murmured
mackay
dazed
it
left
me
wondering
whether
the
stimulation
of
the
dope
might
not
have
heightened
werner
imagination
and
urged
him
on
in
following
something
that
our
more
sluggish
minds
had
never
even
dreamed
meanwhile
i
saw
that
the
doctor
had
arrived
and
that
kennedy
had
helped
carry
werner
to
a
dressing
room
where
first
aid
could
be
given
more
conveniently
now
kennedy
hurried
back
into
the
studio
glancing
quickly
this
way
and
that
as
though
to
catch
signs
of
confusion
or
guilt
upon
the
faces
of
those
about
us
i
colored
instead
of
making
explanations
to
mackay
explanations
which
could
have
waited
i
might
have
used
what
faculties
of
observation
i
possessed
to
aid
kennedy
while
he
was
giving
first
consideration
to
the
life
of
a
man
as
it
was
i
did
know
what
had
become
of
any
of
the
various
people
upon
our
list
of
possible
suspects
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
any
or
every
sign
and
clue
to
the
attack
upon
werner
might
have
been
removed
or
destroyed
a
sudden
hush
caused
all
of
us
to
turn
toward
the
door
leading
to
the
dressing
rooms
it
was
the
physician
he
raised
a
hand
for
attention
his
voice
was
low
but
it
carried
to
every
corner
of
the
studio
werner
is
dead
he
announced
xxi
merle
shirley
overacts
appalled
i
wondered
who
it
was
who
had
to
cover
up
one
crime
committed
another
who
had
struck
down
an
innocent
man
to
save
a
guilty
neck
kennedy
hurried
to
the
side
of
the
physician
and
i
followed
what
symptoms
did
you
observe
asked
kennedy
quickly
seeking
confirmation
of
his
own
first
impressions
his
mouth
seemed
dry
and
i
should
say
he
suffered
from
a
quick
prostration
there
seemed
to
be
a
complete
loss
of
power
to
swallow
or
speak
the
pupils
were
dilated
as
though
from
paralysis
of
the
eyes
both
pharynx
and
larynx
were
affected
there
was
respiration
paralysis
it
seemed
also
as
though
the
cranial
nerves
were
partially
paralyzed
it
was
typically
a
condition
due
to
some
toxic
substance
which
paralyzed
and
depressed
certain
areas
of
the
body
kennedy
nodded
that
fits
in
with
a
theory
i
have
i
thought
quickly
then
inquired
could
it
be
the
snake
venom
again
no
kennedy
replied
shaking
his
head
there
a
difference
in
the
symptoms
and
there
is
no
mark
on
any
exposed
part
of
the
body
as
near
as
i
could
see
in
a
superficial
examination
he
turned
to
the
physician
could
you
give
me
blood
smears
and
some
of
the
stomach
contents
at
once
twice
now
some
one
has
been
stricken
down
before
the
very
eyes
of
the
actors
this
thing
has
gone
too
far
to
trifle
with
or
delay
a
moment
the
doctor
hurried
off
toward
the
dressing
room
anxious
to
help
kennedy
and
as
excited
i
thought
as
any
of
us
next
kennedy
faced
me
did
you
watch
the
people
at
all
walter
i
i
was
too
upset
by
the
suddenness
of
it
i
stammered
all
seemed
to
have
suspicion
of
some
one
else
and
there
was
a
general
constraint
as
though
even
the
innocent
feared
to
do
or
say
something
that
might
look
or
sound
incriminating
i
turned
all
were
now
watching
every
move
we
made
though
just
yet
none
ventured
to
follow
us
it
was
as
though
they
felt
that
to
do
so
was
like
crossing
a
dead
line
i
wondered
which
one
of
them
might
be
looking
at
us
with
inward
trepidation
or
perhaps
satisfaction
if
there
had
been
any
chance
to
remove
anything
incriminating
kennedy
strode
over
toward
the
set
mackay
and
i
at
his
heels
as
we
moved
across
the
floor
i
noticed
that
everyone
clustered
as
close
as
he
dared
afraid
seemingly
of
any
action
which
might
hinder
the
investigation
yet
unwilling
to
miss
any
detail
of
method
in
contrast
with
the
clamor
and
racket
of
less
than
a
half
hour
previously
there
was
now
a
deathlike
stillness
beneath
the
arched
roof
the
heat
was
more
oppressive
than
ever
before
in
the
faces
and
expressions
of
the
awed
witnesses
of
death
swift
hand
there
was
horror
and
a
growing
fear
no
one
spoke
except
in
whispers
when
anybody
moved
it
was
on
tiptoe
cautiously
millard
creation
the
black
terror
could
have
inspired
no
dread
greater
than
this
of
the
people
we
wished
to
study
phelps
caught
our
eyes
the
first
dejected
crushed
utterly
discouraged
he
was
slouched
down
in
a
chair
just
at
the
edge
of
the
supposed
banquet
hall
i
had
no
doubt
of
the
nature
of
his
thoughts
there
was
probably
only
the
most
perfunctory
sympathy
for
the
stricken
director
without
question
his
mind
ran
to
dollars
the
to
this
tragedy
was
that
the
death
of
werner
was
simply
another
step
in
the
wrecking
of
manton
pictures
kennedy
i
saw
hardly
gave
him
a
passing
glance
manton
we
observed
near
the
door
with
the
possible
exception
of
millard
he
seemed
about
the
least
concerned
the
two
scenario
writer
and
producer
had
counterfeited
the
melodrama
of
life
so
often
in
their
productions
that
even
the
second
sinister
chapter
in
this
film
mystery
failed
to
penetrate
their
inwardly
they
may
have
felt
as
deeply
as
any
of
the
rest
but
both
maintained
their
outward
composure
on
manton
shoulders
was
the
responsibility
for
the
picture
i
could
see
that
he
was
nervous
irritable
yet
as
various
employees
approached
for
their
instructions
in
this
emergency
he
never
lost
his
grasp
of
affairs
in
the
vibrant
quiet
of
this
studio
chamber
still
under
the
shadow
of
tragedy
we
witnessed
as
a
bit
of
business
generalship
as
has
ever
come
to
my
knowledge
we
overheard
because
manton
voice
carried
across
to
us
in
the
stillness
kauf
the
name
i
remembered
as
that
of
the
technical
or
art
director
under
werner
responsible
for
the
sets
of
the
black
terror
yes
mr
manton
kauf
was
a
slim
man
gray
and
a
dynamo
of
energy
in
a
quiet
subservient
way
he
ran
to
manton
side
remember
once
telling
me
you
wanted
to
become
a
director
that
you
wanted
to
make
pictures
for
me
yes
sir
you
are
familiar
with
the
script
of
black
terror
are
you
you
know
the
people
and
how
they
work
and
you
have
sets
lined
up
how
would
you
like
to
finish
the
direction
but
but
to
the
credit
of
the
little
man
he
dabbed
at
his
eyes
i
guess
he
had
been
fond
of
his
immediate
superior
werner
is
he
stammered
of
course
manton
voice
rose
slightly
if
werner
was
dead
i
would
need
another
director
at
a
moment
notice
some
one
has
to
complete
black
terror
we
have
all
these
people
on
salary
and
all
the
studio
expense
and
the
release
date
settled
so
that
we
ca
stop
it
your
chance
kauf
do
you
want
it
sir
good
i
double
your
salary
including
all
this
week
now
can
you
finish
this
banquet
set
while
you
have
the
people
kauf
eyes
went
wide
then
he
started
to
flush
well
then
we
simply
ca
lay
off
a
day
kauf
all
all
right
sir
it
seemed
to
me
that
everyone
in
the
place
sensed
the
horror
of
this
literally
actually
werner
body
could
not
be
cold
even
the
police
the
medical
examiner
had
not
had
sufficient
time
to
make
the
trip
out
for
their
investigation
yet
the
director
successor
had
been
appointed
and
told
to
hurry
the
production
i
glanced
at
phelps
he
raised
his
head
slowly
his
expression
lifting
at
the
thought
that
production
was
to
continue
without
interruption
in
another
moment
however
there
was
a
change
in
his
face
his
eyes
sought
manton
and
hardened
his
mouth
tightened
hate
a
deep
unreasoning
hate
settled
into
his
features
kennedy
pausing
just
long
enough
to
observe
the
promoter
appointment
of
kauf
to
werner
position
continued
on
toward
the
set
now
as
i
looked
about
i
saw
that
jack
gordon
was
missing
as
well
as
marilyn
loring
presumably
they
had
gone
to
their
dressing
rooms
all
the
other
actors
and
actresses
were
waiting
ill
at
ease
wondering
at
the
outcome
of
the
tragedy
suddenly
kennedy
stopped
and
i
grasped
that
it
was
the
peculiar
actions
of
merle
shirley
which
had
halted
him
the
heavy
man
was
the
only
one
of
the
company
actually
in
the
fabricated
banquet
hall
itself
clinging
to
him
still
were
the
grim
flowing
robes
of
the
black
terror
as
though
he
were
some
tragedian
he
was
pacing
up
and
down
hands
behind
his
back
head
bowed
eyes
on
the
floor
more
he
was
mumbling
to
himself
it
was
evident
however
that
it
was
neither
a
pose
nor
mental
aberration
shirley
was
searching
for
something
out
in
the
open
without
attempt
at
concealment
swearing
softly
at
his
lack
of
success
kennedy
pushed
forward
did
you
lose
something
mr
shirley
no
the
heavy
man
straightened
as
he
drew
himself
up
in
his
sinister
garb
i
thought
again
of
the
cheap
actors
of
a
day
when
moving
pictures
had
yet
to
the
field
of
the
lurid
melodrama
it
seemed
to
me
that
merle
shirley
was
overacting
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
be
so
wrought
up
over
the
slaying
of
a
man
who
after
all
was
only
his
director
certainly
not
a
close
nor
an
intimate
relationship
kennedy
he
stated
ponderously
there
has
been
a
second
death
and
at
the
hand
which
struck
down
stella
lamar
in
tarrytown
somewhere
in
this
banquet
hall
interior
there
is
a
clue
to
the
murderer
i
have
kept
a
careful
watch
so
that
nothing
might
be
disturbed
do
you
suspect
anyone
kennedy
asked
shirley
glanced
away
and
we
knew
he
was
lying
no
not
definitely
who
has
been
in
the
set
since
i
left
with
the
doctor
no
one
except
myself
that
is
shirley
wanted
to
make
it
clear
no
one
has
had
any
opportunity
to
hide
or
move
or
take
or
change
a
thing
because
i
have
been
right
here
all
the
time
i
see
thanks
and
kennedy
seemed
genuinely
apologetic
if
you
do
mind
i
would
prefer
to
make
my
investigation
alone
shirley
turned
on
his
heel
and
made
for
his
dressing
room
meanwhile
i
had
noticed
a
bit
of
between
enid
faye
and
lawrence
millard
the
only
others
of
our
possible
suspects
about
enid
first
had
caught
my
eye
because
she
seemed
to
be
pleading
with
the
writer
trying
to
hold
him
i
gathered
from
the
look
of
disgust
on
millard
face
that
he
wanted
to
get
shirley
out
of
the
set
before
kennedy
should
observe
the
heavy
man
odd
reaction
to
the
tragedy
while
i
had
never
seen
millard
and
shirley
together
so
as
to
establish
in
mind
the
state
of
their
feelings
toward
each
other
this
would
seem
to
indicate
that
they
were
friendly
certainly
shirley
was
making
a
fool
of
himself
enid
acted
i
guessed
so
as
to
prevent
millard
interference
probably
with
the
idea
that
millard
in
some
fashion
might
bring
suspicion
upon
himself
it
struck
me
that
enid
had
a
wholesome
respect
for
kennedy
at
any
rate
millard
watched
the
little
scene
between
kennedy
and
shirley
with
a
quizzical
expression
as
shirley
left
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
then
he
gave
enid
cheeks
a
playful
pinch
each
and
started
out
after
the
heavy
man
in
leisurely
fashion
just
about
the
same
moment
kennedy
called
me
to
his
side
walter
he
pleaded
in
a
low
voice
will
you
hurry
out
to
the
dressing
room
where
the
doctor
and
i
took
werner
and
get
the
blood
smears
and
sample
of
the
stomach
contents
i
do
want
to
leave
this
because
we
must
work
fast
and
get
all
the
data
we
need
before
the
police
arrive
with
perhaps
a
hundred
people
to
question
they
be
apt
to
make
a
fine
mess
of
everything
this
is
an
outlying
precinct
where
we
draw
the
amateurs
you
know
i
saw
that
mackay
was
helping
him
and
so
i
left
cheerfully
making
my
way
as
fast
as
i
could
toward
the
door
through
which
both
shirley
and
millard
had
passed
in
the
hallway
of
the
building
devoted
to
dressing
rooms
i
found
that
i
did
not
know
which
one
contained
werner
body
this
corridor
was
familiar
here
kennedy
and
i
had
waited
for
marilyn
loring
and
had
witnessed
the
scene
between
shirley
and
herself
now
i
did
not
even
remember
the
location
of
her
room
at
last
on
a
chance
i
tried
a
door
softly
from
within
came
whispered
voices
of
deep
intensity
about
to
close
it
quickly
i
realized
suddenly
that
i
recognized
the
speakers
in
spite
of
the
whispers
it
was
marilyn
and
shirley
they
were
together
now
i
recollected
the
figured
chintz
which
covered
the
wall
and
was
to
be
seen
through
the
crack
made
by
the
open
door
it
was
her
room
they
had
not
heard
my
hand
on
the
knob
nor
the
catch
did
not
know
that
anyone
could
eavesdrop
you
see
her
tones
were
the
more
vibrant
you
waited
i
had
to
no
i
advised
you
to
act
at
once
i
could
i
ca
even
now
all
right
her
tone
became
bitter
go
ahead
your
own
way
but
you
must
count
the
cost
you
may
lose
me
again
merle
shirley
how
do
you
mean
her
answer
in
the
faintest
of
whispers
staggered
me
if
you
have
the
blood
of
another
man
on
your
hands
i
through
xxii
the
stem
though
my
hands
trembled
so
that
i
could
hardly
control
them
i
managed
to
close
the
door
softly
and
to
back
away
down
the
hall
without
being
discovered
my
head
was
spinning
and
i
was
dizzy
with
my
own
ears
i
had
heard
marilyn
loring
virtually
betray
the
guilt
of
the
man
she
loved
and
whom
therefore
she
had
tried
to
shield
if
you
have
the
blood
of
another
man
on
your
hands
what
more
could
kennedy
want
i
started
to
run
toward
the
studio
then
recollection
of
my
errand
stopped
me
kennedy
wished
the
blood
smears
and
stomach
contents
and
was
anxious
to
get
them
before
the
arrival
of
the
police
at
first
i
thought
that
all
such
evidence
would
be
unnecessary
now
after
the
dialogue
i
had
overheard
but
it
struck
me
as
an
afterthought
that
it
might
be
necessary
still
to
prove
shirley
guilt
to
the
satisfaction
of
a
court
and
jury
and
so
i
rushed
to
the
next
dressing
room
and
to
another
until
i
located
the
doctor
and
the
body
of
the
dead
man
with
the
little
package
for
kennedy
safely
in
my
pocket
i
hurried
out
again
into
the
sweltering
heat
beneath
the
glass
of
the
big
studio
and
to
the
side
of
kennedy
and
mackay
in
the
set
you
have
a
sample
of
each
article
of
food
now
he
was
asking
the
district
attorney
you
are
sure
you
have
missed
nothing
as
far
as
possible
i
took
my
samples
from
the
table
where
werner
sat
mackay
explained
when
the
prop
boy
gets
here
with
an
empty
bottle
and
cork
i
have
a
sample
of
the
wine
i
think
it
the
wine
he
added
kennedy
turned
to
me
you
got
in
my
pocket
i
interrupted
then
rather
breathlessly
i
repeated
the
conversation
i
had
overheard
good
lord
mackay
flushed
there
it
is
shirley
the
man
and
take
him
now
quick
without
waiting
for
a
warrant
see
i
ejaculated
to
kennedy
he
killed
stella
because
she
made
a
fool
of
him
and
then
when
werner
discovered
that
and
followed
him
to
tarrytown
the
other
night
it
probably
put
him
in
a
panic
of
fear
and
so
to
keep
werner
from
talking
easy
walter
not
so
fast
what
you
overheard
is
insufficient
ground
for
shirley
conviction
unless
you
could
make
him
confess
and
i
doubt
you
could
make
him
do
that
why
this
was
mackay
because
i
do
think
he
guilty
at
least
kennedy
as
always
was
cautious
in
his
statements
not
so
far
as
anything
we
now
know
would
indicate
but
his
anger
at
stella
i
protested
and
marilyn
remark
miss
lamar
death
was
the
result
of
a
cool
unfeeling
plan
not
pique
or
anger
the
same
cruel
careful
brain
executed
this
second
crime
mackay
i
saw
was
convinced
by
kennedy
how
do
you
account
for
the
dialogue
jameson
overheard
he
asked
miss
loring
told
us
that
shirley
suspected
some
one
and
was
watching
and
would
not
tell
her
or
anyone
else
who
it
was
it
seems
most
likely
to
me
that
it
is
the
truth
mackay
in
that
case
her
remark
means
that
she
believes
his
silence
in
a
way
is
responsible
for
werner
death
oh
if
shirley
had
taken
you
into
his
confidence
for
instance
i
might
possibly
have
succeeded
in
gaining
sufficient
evidence
for
an
arrest
thus
averting
this
tragedy
but
it
is
only
a
theory
of
mine
i
scowled
it
seemed
to
me
that
kennedy
was
minimizing
things
in
a
way
unusual
for
him
i
wondered
if
he
really
thought
the
heavy
man
innocent
it
still
my
belief
that
shirley
is
guilty
i
asserted
a
sound
of
confusion
from
the
courtyard
beneath
the
heavy
studio
windows
caught
kennedy
ear
and
ended
the
colloquy
from
some
of
those
near
enough
to
look
out
we
received
the
explanation
the
police
had
arrived
fully
of
an
hour
after
werner
death
i
get
the
little
bottle
of
wine
sure
mackay
murmured
picking
up
the
food
samples
he
had
wrapped
and
crowding
the
bulky
package
into
a
pocket
i
do
see
why
that
would
have
been
any
easier
to
poison
than
the
food
was
my
objection
everyone
was
looking
very
simple
the
food
was
brought
in
quite
late
besides
it
was
dished
out
by
the
caterer
before
the
eyes
of
forty
or
fifty
people
or
more
and
there
was
no
telling
which
plate
would
go
to
werner
place
the
drinks
were
poured
last
of
all
i
remember
seeing
the
bubbles
rise
and
wondering
whether
they
would
register
at
the
distance
kennedy
did
not
look
at
me
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
he
went
on
casually
that
the
glasses
were
all
set
out
empty
at
the
various
places
long
before
and
that
there
might
easily
have
been
a
few
drops
of
something
if
it
were
colorless
placed
in
the
bottom
of
glass
with
scarcely
a
chance
of
its
being
discovered
especially
by
a
man
who
had
so
much
on
his
mind
at
the
time
as
werner
had
he
must
have
indicated
where
he
would
sit
when
he
arranged
the
camera
stands
and
the
location
of
the
tables
i
had
not
thought
of
that
kennedy
frowned
if
only
i
could
have
located
more
of
that
broken
glass
as
he
faced
me
i
could
read
his
disappointment
walter
made
a
most
careful
search
of
his
chair
and
the
table
and
everything
about
the
space
where
he
dropped
the
poison
must
have
been
in
the
wine
but
there
not
a
tiny
sliver
of
that
glass
left
nothing
but
a
thousand
bits
ground
into
the
canvas
too
small
to
hold
even
a
drop
of
the
liquid
just
think
a
dried
stain
of
the
wine
no
matter
how
tiny
might
have
served
me
in
a
chemical
analysis
very
suddenly
there
was
a
low
exclamation
from
mackay
look
quick
some
one
must
have
kicked
it
way
over
here
fully
twenty
feet
from
werner
place
in
the
glare
of
the
lights
was
the
hollow
stem
of
a
champagne
glass
its
base
intact
save
for
a
narrow
segment
in
the
stem
still
were
a
couple
of
drops
of
the
wine
as
if
in
a
bulb
or
tube
can
it
be
the
director
glass
mackay
asked
handing
it
to
kennedy
kennedy
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
fussing
with
his
handkerchief
so
that
the
precious
contents
would
not
drip
out
i
think
so
i
doubt
whether
any
other
glass
was
broken
verify
it
quickly
the
police
were
entering
now
with
manton
following
them
was
the
physician
mackay
and
i
ascertained
readily
that
no
other
glass
had
been
shattered
while
kennedy
searched
the
floor
for
possible
signs
that
the
stem
was
part
of
a
glass
broken
where
we
had
found
it
unquestionably
we
had
a
sample
of
the
actual
wine
quaffed
by
the
unfortunate
werner
elated
we
strolled
to
a
corner
so
as
to
give
the
police
full
charge
they
waste
time
questioning
everyone
kennedy
remarked
i
have
the
real
evidence
he
tapped
his
pocket
the
few
moments
that
he
had
had
to
himself
had
been
ample
for
him
to
obtain
such
evidence
as
was
destroyed
in
so
many
cases
by
the
time
he
was
called
upon
the
scene
a
point
occurred
to
me
you
do
think
the
poison
was
planted
later
during
the
excitement
hardly
our
criminal
is
too
clever
to
take
a
long
chance
in
such
a
case
we
would
know
it
was
some
one
near
werner
and
also
there
would
be
too
many
people
watching
foolhardiness
is
not
boldness
i
took
to
observing
the
methods
of
the
police
which
were
highly
efficient
but
only
in
the
minuteness
of
the
examination
of
witnesses
and
in
the
care
with
which
they
recorded
names
and
facts
and
made
sure
that
no
one
had
slipped
away
to
avoid
the
notoriety
the
actors
and
actresses
who
had
stood
rather
in
awe
of
kennedy
both
here
and
in
kennedy
investigation
at
tarrytown
developed
nimble
tongues
in
their
answers
to
the
city
detectives
the
result
was
a
perfect
maze
of
conflicting
versions
of
werner
cry
and
fall
in
fact
one
scene
shifter
insisted
that
shirley
as
the
black
terror
had
reached
werner
side
and
had
struck
him
before
the
cry
while
an
extra
girl
with
a
faint
lisp
described
with
sobering
accuracy
the
flight
of
a
mysterious
missile
through
the
air
i
realized
then
why
kennedy
had
made
no
effort
to
question
them
under
the
excitement
of
the
scene
the
glamour
of
the
lights
the
sense
of
illusion
and
the
stifling
heat
it
would
have
been
strange
for
any
of
the
people
to
have
retained
correct
impressions
of
the
event
the
police
sergeant
knew
kennedy
by
reputation
and
approached
him
after
a
visit
to
the
dead
man
body
with
the
doctor
his
glance
including
mackay
and
myself
was
frankly
triumphant
well
he
exclaimed
i
do
suppose
it
occurred
to
any
of
you
scientific
guys
to
search
the
fellow
now
did
it
kennedy
smiled
in
good
humor
searching
a
man
is
always
the
scientific
method
you
wo
find
the
word
in
any
scientific
dictionary
no
the
police
officer
eyes
twinkled
there
was
enough
of
the
irish
in
him
to
enjoy
an
encounter
of
this
kind
maybe
not
but
you
might
find
things
in
a
chap
pocket
which
is
better
with
a
flourish
he
produced
a
hypodermic
syringe
the
duplicate
of
the
one
i
had
appropriated
and
a
tiny
bottle
the
man
a
dope
he
added
i
knew
that
replied
kennedy
i
examined
his
arm
where
he
usually
took
his
shots
and
found
no
fresh
mark
of
the
needle
that
does
prove
anything
wait
until
the
medical
examiner
gets
here
he
find
the
fellow
heart
all
shot
full
of
hop
or
something
i
guess
it
is
so
complicated
after
all
he
was
a
hop
fiend
all
right
still
there
nothing
to
indicate
that
he
was
a
suicide
not
suicide
was
the
sergeant
reply
how
could
he
have
died
from
an
overdose
of
the
drug
when
he
taken
any
recently
well
unabashed
then
he
croaked
because
he
had
had
a
shot
the
same
thing
heart
failure
either
way
excited
and
all
you
know
making
the
scene
maybe
he
forgot
to
use
the
needle
at
that
perhaps
you
right
kennedy
shrugged
calmly
what
was
the
use
of
disputing
the
matter
i
started
to
protest
against
the
detective
hypothesis
the
idea
of
any
drug
addict
ever
forgetting
to
take
his
stimulant
was
too
preposterous
but
kennedy
checked
me
all
were
now
keenly
listening
to
the
argument
better
perhaps
to
let
some
one
think
that
nothing
was
suspected
than
to
disclose
the
cards
in
craig
hand
i
saw
that
he
wished
to
get
away
and
had
not
spoken
seriously
he
turned
to
mackay
walter
and
i
will
have
to
hurry
to
the
laboratory
would
you
like
to
come
along
you
bet
i
would
the
district
attorney
showed
his
delight
i
was
just
going
to
ask
if
i
might
do
so
there
nothing
for
me
in
tarrytown
and
this
is
out
of
my
jurisdiction
as
we
turned
away
the
police
sergeant
saw
us
and
called
across
the
floor
not
quite
concealing
a
touch
of
professional
jealousy
the
three
of
you
were
here
at
the
time
were
you
no
kennedy
answered
jameson
and
myself
well
you
two
then
you
witnesses
and
i
ask
you
to
hold
yourself
in
readiness
to
appear
at
the
hearing
i
thought
that
the
policeman
was
particularly
delighted
at
his
position
to
issue
orders
to
kennedy
and
i
was
angered
again
craig
held
me
in
check
we
be
glad
to
tell
anything
we
know
he
replied
then
added
a
little
fling
a
bit
of
sarcasm
which
almost
went
over
the
other
head
that
is
he
amended
as
xxiii
botulin
toxin
mackay
drove
us
to
the
laboratory
in
his
little
car
and
it
was
dark
and
we
were
dinnerless
when
we
arrived
knowing
kennedy
habits
i
sent
out
for
sandwiches
and
started
in
to
make
strong
coffee
upon
an
electric
percolator
the
aroma
tingled
in
my
nostrils
reminding
me
that
i
was
genuinely
hungry
the
district
attorney
too
seemed
more
or
less
similarly
disposed
as
for
kennedy
he
was
interested
in
nothing
but
the
problem
before
him
he
had
been
strangely
quiet
on
the
way
growing
more
and
more
impatient
and
nervous
as
though
the
element
of
time
had
entered
into
the
case
as
though
haste
were
suddenly
imperative
once
the
lights
were
on
in
the
laboratory
he
hurried
about
his
various
preparations
the
food
samples
he
laid
out
but
he
gave
them
no
attention
the
blood
smears
and
stomach
contents
he
put
aside
for
future
reference
his
attack
was
upon
the
drop
or
two
of
liquid
adhering
to
the
stem
of
the
broken
champagne
glass
the
entire
chemical
procedure
seemed
to
be
incomprehensible
to
mackay
and
he
was
fascinated
so
that
he
had
considerable
trouble
at
times
keeping
out
of
the
way
of
kennedy
elbow
kennedy
first
washed
the
stem
out
carefully
with
a
few
drops
of
distilled
water
then
he
studied
the
resulting
solution
one
after
another
he
tried
the
things
that
occurred
to
him
making
tests
wholly
unproductive
of
results
slowly
the
laboratory
table
became
littered
completely
with
chemicals
and
apparatus
of
all
sorts
a
veritable
arsenal
of
glass
the
sandwiches
arrived
but
kennedy
refused
to
drop
his
investigation
for
a
moment
i
did
succeed
in
making
him
take
a
cup
of
strong
coffee
and
that
was
all
over
in
a
corner
mackay
and
i
did
full
justice
to
the
food
finishing
the
hot
and
welcome
coffee
and
then
refilling
the
percolator
and
starting
it
on
the
making
of
a
second
brew
the
hours
lengthened
and
when
mackay
grew
tired
of
watching
with
intense
admiration
he
joined
me
in
the
patient
consumption
of
innumerable
cigarettes
kennedy
was
filled
with
the
joy
of
discovery
i
noticed
that
he
did
not
stop
even
for
the
solace
of
tobacco
it
seemed
to
me
that
at
times
his
nostrils
dilated
exactly
like
those
of
a
hound
on
the
scent
finally
he
held
up
a
test
tube
and
turned
to
us
what
is
it
i
asked
some
other
poison
as
rare
and
little
known
as
the
snake
venom
no
something
much
more
curious
in
the
stem
of
the
glass
i
find
the
toxin
of
the
bacillus
botulinus
germs
mackay
inquired
kennedy
shook
his
head
not
germs
but
the
pure
toxin
the
poison
secreted
by
this
bacillus
what
does
it
do
was
my
question
well
thoughtfully
botulism
may
be
ranked
easily
among
the
most
serious
diseases
known
to
medical
science
it
is
hard
to
understand
why
it
is
not
a
great
deal
more
common
it
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
kinds
of
food
poisoning
then
the
apple
juice
they
used
for
the
wine
was
bad
spoiled
no
not
that
werner
was
the
only
one
stricken
somebody
put
the
pure
toxin
in
his
glass
it
was
as
i
suspected
deliberate
murder
as
in
the
case
of
miss
lamar
bacillus
botulinus
produces
a
toxin
that
is
extremely
virulent
hardly
more
than
a
of
a
cubic
centimeter
would
kill
a
guinea
pig
this
was
botulin
itself
the
pure
toxin
an
alkaloid
just
like
that
which
is
formed
in
meat
and
other
food
products
in
cases
of
botulism
the
idea
might
also
have
been
to
make
the
death
seem
natural
due
solely
to
bad
food
do
you
suppose
it
was
used
because
it
was
quick
and
was
colorless
so
as
not
to
be
noticed
in
the
glass
i
hazarded
kennedy
paced
up
and
down
the
laboratory
several
times
in
thought
to
me
walter
this
is
another
indication
of
the
satanic
cleverness
of
the
unknown
criminal
in
the
case
first
miss
lamar
is
to
be
killed
for
that
purpose
something
was
sought
probably
which
could
not
be
traced
easily
to
the
perpetrator
in
snake
venom
an
agent
was
employed
which
may
be
said
to
be
almost
ideal
for
the
grim
business
of
murder
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
identify
in
its
results
it
is
comparatively
unknown
yet
it
is
swift
in
action
and
to
be
obtained
with
fair
ease
differing
from
most
poisons
it
may
be
inflicted
through
a
prick
so
slight
as
to
be
almost
unnoticed
by
the
victim
the
scheme
of
fixing
the
needle
in
the
curtain
was
so
simple
and
yet
so
effective
that
the
guilty
person
need
never
have
feared
its
discovery
under
ordinary
circumstances
or
its
association
with
the
girl
death
if
some
one
stumbled
upon
it
accidentally
the
idea
of
returning
for
the
point
was
only
one
of
the
many
details
of
a
precautionary
measure
upon
which
we
have
stumbled
had
i
found
it
the
next
morning
i
would
have
been
unable
in
all
probability
to
identify
it
as
belonging
to
or
as
obtained
by
any
of
our
suspects
you
must
realize
walter
that
with
all
the
scientific
aids
i
have
been
able
to
bring
to
bear
we
possess
almost
no
direct
evidence
there
are
no
fingerprints
no
cigarette
stubs
no
array
of
personal
intimate
clues
of
any
sort
to
this
criminal
these
are
the
threads
which
lead
the
detective
to
his
quarry
in
fiction
and
on
the
stage
here
we
lack
even
the
faintest
description
of
the
man
or
woman
if
that
is
her
sex
it
is
murder
from
a
distance
planned
with
almost
meticulous
care
executed
coolly
and
without
feeling
or
scruple
after
the
death
of
miss
lamar
i
was
not
so
sure
but
that
the
selection
of
the
snake
venom
was
simply
the
inspiration
of
a
perverted
brain
the
evolution
of
the
detailed
method
of
killing
her
an
outgrowth
of
someone
familiarity
with
studio
life
in
general
with
the
script
of
black
terror
in
particular
now
i
realize
that
we
are
face
to
face
with
the
studied
handiwork
of
a
skilled
criminal
these
two
deaths
may
be
his
or
her
first
departure
into
the
realm
of
crime
but
potentially
we
have
a
i
make
that
statement
because
of
the
manner
of
werner
demise
it
is
evident
that
the
director
stumbled
on
a
clue
to
the
murderer
if
my
first
hypothesis
had
been
correct
if
the
use
of
snake
venom
and
the
unlucky
thirteenth
scene
had
been
largely
a
matter
of
blind
chance
in
the
selection
of
poison
and
method
then
we
might
have
expected
werner
to
be
struck
down
in
some
dark
street
or
perhaps
decoyed
to
his
death
at
the
best
inoculated
with
the
same
crotalin
which
had
killed
miss
lamar
but
let
us
analyze
the
method
used
in
slaying
the
director
if
he
had
been
blackjacked
there
would
be
the
clue
of
the
weapon
always
likely
to
turn
up
the
chance
of
witnesses
and
also
the
likelihood
in
an
extreme
case
that
werner
might
not
die
at
once
but
might
talk
and
give
a
description
of
his
assailant
or
even
survive
much
the
same
objections
from
the
criminal
standpoint
obtain
in
nearly
all
the
accepted
modes
of
killing
a
man
even
the
use
of
venom
a
second
time
possesses
the
disadvantage
of
a
certain
alertness
against
the
very
thing
on
the
part
of
the
victim
werner
was
a
dope
fiend
fully
aware
of
the
potency
of
a
tiny
skin
puncture
i
wager
he
was
on
constant
guard
against
any
sort
of
scratch
on
the
other
hand
the
few
drops
of
toxin
in
the
glass
possessed
every
advantage
from
the
unknown
standpoint
it
was
invisible
and
as
sure
in
its
action
as
the
venom
also
it
was
as
rare
and
as
difficult
to
trace
for
remember
this
botulism
is
food
poisoning
if
i
had
not
found
the
stem
of
that
glass
it
would
be
absolutely
impossible
to
show
that
werner
died
from
anything
on
earth
but
bad
food
that
is
why
i
do
not
even
take
time
to
analyze
the
stomach
contents
that
is
why
i
say
we
are
confronted
by
an
archscoundrel
of
highest
intelligence
and
downright
cleverness
more
kennedy
paused
for
emphasis
i
realize
now
the
presence
of
a
grim
invisible
menace
it
has
just
now
been
driven
home
to
me
the
botulin
with
its
deadly
paralyzing
power
sealed
werner
tongue
even
while
he
tried
to
tell
me
what
he
knew
mackay
was
tremendously
impressed
by
kennedy
explanation
does
this
mean
he
asked
that
the
guilty
man
or
woman
is
some
outsider
those
we
have
figured
as
possible
suspects
would
hardly
have
this
detailed
knowledge
of
poisons
there
are
two
possibilities
kennedy
answered
the
real
person
behind
the
two
murders
may
have
employed
some
one
else
to
carry
out
the
actual
killing
a
hypothesis
i
do
not
take
seriously
or
again
he
paused
this
may
be
a
case
of
some
one
with
intelligence
starting
out
upon
his
career
of
crime
intelligently
by
reading
up
on
his
subject
it
is
as
simple
to
learn
how
to
use
crotalin
or
botulin
toxin
or
any
number
of
hundreds
of
deadly
substances
as
it
is
to
obtain
the
majority
of
them
in
fact
if
people
generally
understood
the
ease
with
which
whole
communities
could
be
wiped
out
and
grasped
that
it
could
be
done
so
as
to
leave
virtually
no
clue
to
the
author
of
the
horror
they
might
not
sleep
as
soundly
at
night
as
they
do
the
saving
grace
is
that
the
average
criminal
is
often
clever
but
almost
never
truly
scientific
unfortunately
we
have
to
combat
one
who
possesses
the
latter
quality
to
a
high
degree
what
is
the
invisible
menace
of
which
you
spoke
craig
i
inquired
the
possibility
of
another
murder
before
we
can
apprehend
the
guilty
person
or
gain
the
evidence
we
need
good
heavens
i
imagine
i
blanched
you
mean
werner
was
struck
down
apparently
for
no
reason
but
that
he
had
guessed
the
identity
of
the
villain
there
is
a
second
man
in
the
company
who
has
certain
suspicions
and
is
acting
upon
them
if
he
is
on
the
right
trail
by
any
chance
kennedy
shrugged
his
shoulders
soberly
shirley
exactly
and
there
is
still
another
possibility
what
is
that
here
in
this
laboratory
i
have
blood
spots
made
on
the
portieres
at
the
house
of
phelps
by
the
man
who
removed
the
needle
probably
the
unknown
himself
possibly
his
or
her
agent
in
any
case
it
is
a
clue
and
the
only
direct
and
infallible
clue
in
existence
to
the
criminal
also
i
have
the
evidence
of
the
snake
venom
and
of
the
botulin
toxin
here
sooner
or
later
the
person
who
killed
werner
because
he
suspected
things
will
wake
up
to
the
fact
that
we
possess
tangible
proof
against
him
i
grew
pale
you
mean
then
that
you
may
be
attacked
yourself
that
even
i
kennedy
smiled
unafraid
but
from
the
expression
in
his
eyes
i
knew
that
he
took
the
thought
of
our
possible
danger
very
seriously
xxiv
the
invisible
menace
mackay
and
i
exchanged
glances
kennedy
busied
himself
putting
away
some
of
the
more
important
bits
of
evidence
in
the
case
placing
the
tiny
tubes
of
solution
the
blood
smears
and
other
items
together
in
a
cabinet
at
the
farther
corner
of
the
laboratory
the
vast
bulk
of
his
paraphernalia
the
array
of
glass
and
chemicals
and
instruments
he
left
on
the
table
for
the
morning
then
he
faced
us
again
with
a
smile
suppose
you
start
up
the
percolator
once
more
walter
he
took
a
cigar
and
lighted
it
from
the
match
i
struck
i
believe
i
earned
another
cup
of
coffee
he
added
mackay
had
been
fidgeting
considerably
since
kennedy
explanation
of
the
possible
danger
to
shirley
as
well
as
to
ourselves
or
even
to
others
is
there
something
we
can
do
kennedy
he
exclaimed
suddenly
is
it
necessary
to
sit
back
and
wait
for
this
unknown
to
strike
again
ordinarily
kennedy
replied
on
a
case
like
this
it
has
been
my
custom
to
permit
the
guilty
parties
to
betray
themselves
as
they
will
do
inevitably
especially
when
i
call
to
my
aid
the
recent
discoveries
of
science
for
the
detection
and
measurement
of
fine
and
almost
imperceptible
shades
of
emotion
but
now
that
i
realize
the
presence
of
this
menace
i
shall
become
a
detective
of
action
in
fact
i
shall
not
stop
at
any
course
to
hurry
matters
the
very
first
thing
in
the
morning
i
shall
go
to
the
studio
and
i
want
you
and
jameson
along
i
his
eyes
twinkled
it
was
the
excitement
at
the
prospect
i
may
need
considerable
help
in
getting
the
evidence
i
wish
which
is
it
was
i
who
interposed
the
question
kennedy
blew
a
cloud
of
smoke
there
are
three
ways
of
tracing
down
a
crime
aside
from
the
police
method
of
stool
pigeons
to
betray
the
criminals
and
the
detective
bureau
method
of
under
pressure
popularly
known
as
the
third
degree
what
are
they
mackay
asked
unaware
that
kennedy
needed
little
prompting
once
he
felt
inclined
to
talk
out
some
matter
puzzling
him
one
is
the
process
of
reasoning
from
the
possible
suspects
to
the
act
itself
in
other
words
putting
the
emphasis
on
the
motive
a
second
is
the
reverse
of
the
first
involving
a
study
of
the
crime
for
clues
and
making
deductions
from
the
inevitable
earmarks
of
the
person
for
the
purpose
of
discovering
his
identity
the
third
method
except
for
some
investigations
across
the
water
is
distinctly
my
own
the
scientific
in
all
sciences
kennedy
went
on
warming
to
his
subject
progress
is
made
by
a
careful
tabulation
of
proved
facts
the
scientific
method
is
the
method
of
exact
knowledge
thus
in
crime
those
things
are
of
value
to
us
which
by
an
infinite
series
of
empiric
observations
have
been
established
and
have
become
incontrovertible
the
familiar
example
of
course
is
fingerprints
nearly
everyone
knows
that
no
two
men
have
the
same
markings
that
the
same
man
displays
a
pattern
which
is
unchanging
from
birth
to
the
grave
no
less
certain
is
the
fact
that
human
blood
differs
from
the
blood
of
animals
that
in
faint
variations
the
blood
of
no
two
people
is
alike
that
the
blood
of
any
living
thing
man
or
beast
is
affected
by
various
things
an
infinite
number
almost
most
of
which
are
positively
known
to
modern
medical
investigators
in
this
case
my
principal
scientific
clue
is
the
blood
left
upon
the
portiere
by
the
man
who
took
the
needle
the
night
following
the
murder
next
in
importance
is
the
fact
demonstrated
by
me
that
some
one
at
the
studio
wiped
a
hypodermic
on
a
towel
after
inoculating
himself
with
antivenin
of
course
i
am
presuming
that
this
latter
man
inoculated
himself
and
not
some
one
else
because
it
is
obvious
if
necessary
i
can
prove
it
later
however
by
analyzing
the
trace
of
blood
that
is
not
the
point
the
point
is
that
whoever
removed
the
needle
pricked
himself
and
yet
did
not
die
of
the
venom
unless
it
was
a
person
not
under
our
observation
an
unlikely
premise
therefore
because
of
this
last
fact
and
because
again
it
is
obvious
i
expect
to
find
that
the
same
individual
inoculated
himself
with
antivenin
and
removed
the
needle
from
the
portiere
and
i
expect
to
prove
it
beyond
possibility
of
doubt
by
an
analysis
of
his
blood
a
sample
of
the
blood
from
this
person
will
be
identical
with
the
spot
on
the
portiere
and
much
the
easier
test
will
contain
traces
of
the
antitoxin
with
that
much
accomplished
a
little
of
the
well
third
degree
will
bring
about
a
confession
it
is
circumstantial
evidence
of
the
strongest
sort
not
only
does
a
man
take
precautions
against
a
given
poison
but
he
is
proved
to
be
the
one
who
removed
the
needle
actually
responsible
for
miss
lamar
death
my
handicap
however
is
that
i
have
no
justifiable
excuse
for
taking
a
sample
of
blood
from
each
of
the
people
we
suspect
or
feel
we
might
suspect
for
that
reason
i
was
waiting
until
one
of
the
other
detective
methods
should
narrow
the
field
of
suspicion
now
that
there
is
the
menace
of
another
attempt
to
take
a
life
i
am
forced
to
act
we
will
get
samples
of
blood
from
everyone
by
artifice
or
force
meanwhile
he
hastened
to
continue
as
though
afraid
we
might
interrupt
to
break
his
train
of
thought
meanwhile
let
us
see
if
it
is
possible
to
accomplish
something
by
the
deductive
method
already
i
have
gone
into
an
analysis
starting
from
the
nature
of
the
crime
and
reasoning
to
the
type
of
criminal
responsible
the
guilty
man
or
woman
is
a
person
of
high
intelligence
added
to
genuine
cleverness
but
for
the
results
accomplished
in
this
laboratory
we
would
be
without
a
clue
our
hands
would
be
tied
completely
both
miss
lamar
and
werner
were
killed
by
unusual
poisons
deadly
and
almost
impossible
to
trace
there
was
a
crowd
of
people
about
in
each
case
yet
we
have
no
witnesses
now
who
out
of
all
our
people
with
possible
motives
are
intelligent
enough
and
clever
enough
to
be
guilty
kennedy
glanced
first
at
me
then
at
mackay
manton
phelps
suggested
the
district
attorney
the
promoter
kennedy
rejoined
is
the
typical
man
of
the
business
world
beneath
the
eccentricity
of
manner
which
seems
to
cling
to
everyone
in
the
picture
field
ordinarily
his
type
thinking
in
millions
of
dollars
and
juggling
nickel
and
dime
admissions
or
other
routine
of
commercial
detail
is
apart
from
the
finer
subtle
passions
of
life
when
a
business
man
commits
murder
he
generally
uses
a
pistol
because
he
is
sure
it
is
efficient
he
can
see
it
work
the
same
applies
to
phelps
millard
mackay
hesitated
now
to
face
the
logic
of
kennedy
keen
mind
he
was
stella
lamar
husband
millard
is
a
scenario
writer
and
so
apt
to
have
a
brain
cluttered
with
all
sorts
of
detail
of
crime
and
murder
at
the
same
time
an
author
is
so
used
to
counterfeiting
emotion
in
his
writings
that
he
seldom
takes
things
seriously
life
becomes
a
joke
and
millard
in
particular
is
a
butterfly
concerned
more
with
the
smiles
of
extra
girls
and
the
favor
of
miss
faye
than
the
fate
of
the
woman
whose
divorce
from
him
was
not
yet
complete
a
writer
is
the
other
extreme
from
the
business
man
the
creator
of
stories
is
essentially
inefficient
because
he
tries
to
feel
rather
than
reason
when
an
author
commits
murder
he
sets
a
stage
for
his
own
benefit
he
is
careful
to
avoid
witnesses
because
they
are
inconvenient
to
dispose
of
at
the
same
time
he
wants
the
victim
to
understand
thoroughly
what
is
going
to
happen
and
so
he
is
apt
to
accompany
his
crime
with
a
speech
worded
very
carefully
indeed
then
he
may
start
with
an
attempt
to
throttle
a
person
and
end
up
with
a
hatchet
or
he
may
plan
to
use
a
razor
and
at
the
end
brain
his
quarry
with
a
chair
he
lives
too
many
lives
to
follow
one
through
clearly
his
own
how
about
shirley
i
put
in
at
first
glance
shirley
and
gordon
suggest
themselves
because
both
murders
were
highly
spectacular
and
the
actor
above
everything
else
enjoys
a
big
scene
after
werner
death
for
instance
shirley
literally
strutted
up
and
down
in
that
set
he
was
so
full
of
the
situation
so
carried
away
by
the
drama
of
the
occasion
that
he
failed
utterly
to
realize
how
suspicious
his
conduct
would
seem
to
an
observer
unfortunately
for
our
hypotheses
the
use
of
venom
and
toxin
is
too
efficient
the
theatrical
temperament
must
have
emotion
an
actor
cruel
and
vicious
enough
to
strike
down
two
people
as
miss
lamar
and
werner
were
stricken
of
sufficient
dramatic
to
conceive
of
the
manner
of
their
deaths
would
want
to
see
them
writhe
and
suffer
he
would
select
poisons
equally
rare
and
effective
but
those
more
slow
and
painful
in
their
operation
no
walter
shirley
is
not
indicated
by
this
method
of
reasoning
the
arrangement
of
the
scenes
for
the
murders
was
simply
another
detail
of
efficiency
not
due
to
a
wish
to
be
spectacular
the
crowd
about
in
each
case
has
added
greatly
to
the
difficulty
of
investigation
do
you
include
gordon
in
that
mackay
asked
yes
and
in
addition
kennedy
smiled
slightly
i
believe
that
gordon
is
rather
stupid
for
one
thing
he
has
had
several
fights
in
public
at
the
goats
club
and
at
the
midnight
fads
and
i
suppose
elsewhere
that
is
not
the
clever
rogue
furthermore
he
had
been
speculating
not
just
now
and
then
but
desperately
doggedly
clever
men
speculate
but
scientific
men
never
our
unknown
criminal
is
both
clever
and
intelligent
that
brings
you
to
the
girls
then
mackay
remarked
kennedy
face
clouded
and
i
could
see
that
he
was
troubled
to
be
honest
in
this
one
particular
method
of
deduction
he
stated
i
must
admit
that
both
miss
faye
and
miss
loring
are
worthy
of
suspicion
the
fact
of
their
rise
in
the
film
world
the
evidences
of
their
popularity
is
proof
that
they
are
clever
miss
loring
in
my
few
brief
moments
of
contact
with
her
on
two
occasions
showed
a
grasp
of
things
and
a
quickness
which
indicate
to
me
that
she
possesses
a
rare
order
of
intelligence
for
a
woman
as
for
miss
faye
again
he
hesitated
one
little
act
of
hers
demonstrated
intelligence
when
shirley
was
standing
guard
in
the
set
after
werner
death
and
making
a
fool
of
himself
millard
evidently
wanted
to
get
over
and
speak
to
him
perhaps
to
tell
him
not
to
let
me
find
him
searching
the
scene
as
though
his
life
depended
upon
it
perhaps
something
else
but
miss
faye
stopped
him
unquestionably
she
saw
that
anyone
taking
an
interest
in
the
remains
of
the
banquet
just
then
would
become
an
object
of
suspicion
do
you
really
suspect
marilyn
or
enid
i
inquired
if
this
were
half
a
generation
ago
i
would
say
without
hesitation
that
the
crime
was
the
handiwork
of
a
man
but
now
the
women
are
in
everything
young
girls
particularly
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
mackay
had
one
more
suggestion
the
camera
men
the
extras
the
technical
and
studio
staffs
they
are
not
worthy
of
consideration
are
they
kennedy
shook
his
head
the
odor
of
coffee
struck
my
nostrils
and
i
turned
to
find
the
percolator
steaming
kennedy
leaned
over
to
take
a
whiff
mackay
rose
at
that
moment
there
was
a
sudden
crash
and
the
was
shattered
simultaneously
a
flash
of
light
and
a
deafening
explosion
took
place
in
the
room
scattering
broadcast
tiny
bits
of
glass
from
the
laboratory
table
splashing
chemicals
many
of
them
dangerous
over
everything
kennedy
hurried
to
the
wreck
of
his
paraphernalia
in
an
instant
he
held
up
a
tiny
bit
of
jagged
metal
an
explosive
bullet
he
exclaimed
an
attempt
to
destroy
my
evidence
xxv
itching
salve
for
once
i
rose
with
kennedy
he
preceded
me
to
the
laboratory
after
breakfast
however
leaving
me
to
wait
for
mackay
when
the
little
district
attorney
arrived
i
noticed
that
he
carried
a
package
which
looked
as
though
it
might
contain
a
film
can
the
negative
we
took
from
the
cameras
at
tarrytown
he
explained
also
a
print
from
each
roll
ready
to
run
i
been
holding
this
as
evidence
kennedy
wanted
me
to
bring
it
with
me
he
waiting
for
us
at
the
laboratory
i
remarked
he
straighten
everything
up
in
a
hurry
wo
he
kennedy
the
most
individual
i
ever
knew
i
laughed
if
he
sees
a
chance
of
getting
his
man
then
i
became
enthusiastic
often
i
seen
him
gather
a
group
of
people
in
a
room
perhaps
without
the
faintest
shred
of
legal
right
to
do
so
and
there
make
the
guilty
person
confess
simply
by
marshaling
the
evidence
or
maybe
betray
himself
by
some
scientific
device
it
wonderful
mackay
do
you
think
he
plans
something
of
that
kind
this
morning
i
led
the
way
to
the
door
after
what
happened
last
night
i
know
that
kennedy
will
resort
to
almost
anything
the
district
attorney
fingered
the
package
under
his
arm
he
might
get
everyone
in
the
projection
room
then
and
make
them
watch
the
actual
photographic
record
of
stella
death
the
scene
where
she
scratched
herself
let
hurry
i
interrupted
when
we
entered
the
laboratory
we
found
kennedy
vigorously
fanning
a
towel
which
he
had
hung
up
to
dry
i
recognized
it
as
the
one
i
had
discovered
in
the
studio
washroom
immediately
following
the
first
murder
this
will
serve
me
better
as
bait
than
as
evidence
he
laughed
i
have
impregnated
it
with
a
colorless
chemical
which
will
cling
to
the
fibers
and
enable
me
to
identify
the
most
infinitesimal
trace
of
it
we
shall
get
up
to
the
studio
and
start
well
i
guess
you
could
call
it
fishing
for
the
guilty
man
he
fingered
the
folds
then
jerked
the
towel
down
and
flung
it
to
me
here
walter
it
dry
enough
now
i
want
you
to
rub
the
contents
of
that
tiny
can
of
grease
open
before
you
there
into
the
cloth
he
hurried
over
to
wash
his
hands
i
spread
the
towel
out
on
the
table
and
began
to
work
in
the
stuff
indicated
by
kennedy
there
was
no
odor
and
it
seemed
like
some
patent
ointment
in
color
at
first
i
was
puzzled
then
absently
i
touched
the
back
of
one
hand
with
the
greasy
fingers
of
the
other
and
immediately
an
itching
set
up
so
annoying
that
i
had
to
abandon
my
task
kennedy
chuckled
that
itching
salve
walter
the
cuticle
pads
at
your
finger
tips
are
too
thick
but
touch
yourself
anywhere
else
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
better
use
soap
and
water
if
you
want
any
relief
then
you
can
start
over
again
at
the
basin
i
thought
i
grasped
his
little
plot
you
going
to
plant
the
towel
i
asked
so
that
the
interested
party
will
try
to
get
hold
of
it
evidently
he
thought
it
unnecessary
to
reply
to
me
why
could
you
just
put
it
somewhere
without
all
the
preparation
mackay
suggested
and
watch
to
see
who
came
after
it
because
our
criminal
too
clever
kennedy
rejoined
our
only
chance
to
get
it
stolen
is
to
make
it
very
plain
that
it
is
not
being
watched
whoever
steals
it
however
possibly
will
reveal
himself
on
account
of
the
itching
salve
in
any
case
i
expect
to
be
able
to
trace
the
towel
to
the
thief
no
matter
what
efforts
are
made
to
destroy
it
the
towel
was
wrapped
in
a
heavy
bit
of
paper
then
placed
with
a
microscope
and
some
other
paraphernalia
in
a
small
battered
traveling
bag
climbing
into
mackay
little
roadster
we
soon
were
speeding
toward
the
studio
will
you
be
able
to
help
me
to
stay
with
jameson
and
myself
all
day
kennedy
asked
the
district
attorney
after
perhaps
a
mile
of
silence
surely
it
what
i
was
hoping
you
allow
me
to
do
i
have
no
authority
down
here
though
i
understand
but
the
police
or
an
outsider
might
allow
some
of
my
plans
to
become
known
he
paused
a
moment
in
thought
the
film
you
brought
in
with
you
consists
of
the
scenes
on
the
rolls
of
negative
in
use
at
the
time
of
miss
lamar
collapse
it
may
or
may
not
include
the
action
where
she
scratched
herself
now
i
want
the
scenes
up
to
thirteen
put
together
in
proper
order
first
as
photographed
by
one
camera
then
as
caught
by
the
other
i
arrange
for
the
services
of
a
cutter
and
for
the
delivery
to
me
of
any
other
negative
or
positive
overlooked
by
us
when
we
had
the
two
boxes
sealed
and
given
into
your
custody
at
tarrytown
will
you
superintend
the
assembly
of
the
scenes
so
that
you
can
be
sure
nothing
is
taken
out
or
omitted
of
course
i
want
to
do
anything
i
can
upon
arrival
at
the
studio
we
detected
this
time
all
the
signs
of
a
complete
demoralization
the
death
of
werner
the
fact
that
he
had
been
stricken
down
during
the
taking
of
a
scene
and
on
the
very
stage
had
served
to
bring
the
tragedy
home
to
the
people
more
it
was
a
second
murder
in
four
days
apparently
by
the
same
hand
as
the
first
a
sense
of
dread
a
nameless
intangible
fear
had
taken
form
and
found
its
way
under
the
big
blackened
glass
roofs
and
around
and
through
the
corridors
into
the
dressing
rooms
and
back
even
to
the
manufacturing
and
purely
technical
departments
the
gateman
eyed
us
with
undisguised
uneasiness
as
we
drove
through
the
archway
into
the
yard
in
that
inclosure
there
were
only
two
cars
manton
and
one
we
later
learned
belonged
to
phelps
the
sole
human
being
to
enter
our
range
of
vision
was
an
office
boy
he
skirted
the
side
of
the
building
as
though
the
menace
of
death
were
in
the
air
or
likely
to
strike
out
of
the
very
heavens
without
warning
we
found
kauf
in
the
large
studio
obviously
unhappy
in
the
shoes
of
the
unfortunate
werner
probably
from
motives
of
efficiency
in
psychology
the
new
director
had
made
no
attempt
to
resume
work
at
once
in
the
banquet
set
but
had
turned
to
the
companion
ballroom
setting
since
both
had
been
prepared
and
made
ready
at
the
same
time
kennedy
explained
our
presence
so
early
in
the
morning
very
neatly
i
thought
i
would
appreciate
it
he
began
if
you
could
place
a
cutter
at
the
disposal
of
mackay
he
has
the
scenes
taken
from
the
camera
and
sealed
at
the
time
of
miss
lamar
death
i
would
like
to
have
any
other
film
taken
out
there
delivered
to
him
and
the
whole
joined
in
proper
sequence
then
kauf
if
you
could
arrange
to
have
the
same
cutter
take
the
film
exposed
yesterday
when
werner
you
think
you
might
be
able
to
see
something
to
discover
something
on
the
screen
exactly
kauf
beamed
manton
gave
me
orders
to
assist
you
in
every
way
i
could
or
to
put
any
of
my
people
at
your
disposal
more
than
that
kennedy
he
anticipated
you
he
thought
you
might
want
to
look
at
the
scenes
taken
yesterday
and
he
rushed
the
laboratory
and
the
printing
room
we
be
able
to
fix
you
up
very
quickly
good
kennedy
nodded
to
mackay
and
the
district
attorney
hurried
off
with
kauf
now
walter
he
exclaimed
sobering
i
picked
up
the
traveling
bag
and
together
we
strolled
toward
the
ballroom
set
there
most
of
the
players
were
gathered
already
in
and
evening
clothes
of
a
fancier
sort
even
than
those
demanded
for
the
banquet
i
saw
that
kennedy
singled
out
marilyn
good
morning
she
said
cheerfully
but
with
effort
it
was
obvious
she
had
spent
a
nervous
night
there
were
circles
under
her
eyes
ill
concealed
by
the
small
quantity
of
cosmetic
she
used
her
hands
shifting
constantly
displayed
the
loss
of
her
usual
poise
you
are
out
bright
and
early
she
added
we
stumbled
into
a
very
important
clue
kennedy
told
her
with
a
show
of
giving
her
his
confidence
in
that
bag
in
walter
hand
is
one
of
the
studio
towels
it
contains
a
hint
of
the
poison
used
to
kill
miss
lamar
and
of
utmost
consequence
it
has
provided
me
with
an
infallible
clue
to
the
identity
of
the
murderer
himself
or
herself
it
seemed
to
me
that
marilyn
blanched
where
where
did
you
find
it
she
demanded
in
a
very
awed
voice
in
one
of
the
studio
washrooms
it
has
been
it
has
been
in
the
washroom
ever
since
poor
death
no
not
that
jameson
discovered
it
the
same
day
but
the
very
slight
pause
was
perceptible
to
me
kennedy
hated
to
lie
i
have
realized
its
importance
until
just
this
morning
enid
faye
seeing
us
from
a
distance
conquered
her
dislike
of
marilyn
sufficiently
to
join
us
she
was
very
erect
and
tense
her
eyes
wide
and
sober
and
searching
traveled
from
my
face
to
kennedy
and
back
then
she
dissembled
softening
as
she
came
close
to
me
laying
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
allowing
her
skirt
to
brush
my
trousers
tell
me
jamie
she
whispered
her
warm
breath
thrilling
me
through
and
through
has
the
wonderful
craig
kennedy
discovered
something
it
was
not
sarcasm
but
assumed
playfulness
masking
a
throbbing
curiosity
i
found
a
towel
in
one
of
the
studio
washrooms
i
answered
and
craig
has
demonstrated
that
it
is
a
clue
to
the
poison
which
killed
stella
lamar
as
well
as
to
the
person
who
did
it
enid
gasped
then
she
drew
herself
up
and
her
eyes
narrowed
now
she
faced
kennedy
how
can
the
towel
be
a
clue
to
the
crime
she
protested
stella
was
was
murdered
way
out
in
tarrytown
jameson
found
the
towel
here
kennedy
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
can
not
tell
you
that
just
yet
he
paused
deliberately
you
see
he
lied
i
have
yet
to
make
my
analysis
but
you
know
it
a
clue
to
the
that
towel
he
raised
his
voice
as
though
in
elation
that
towel
will
lead
me
to
the
murderer
infallibly
merle
shirley
had
come
up
in
time
to
hear
most
of
the
colloquy
between
enid
and
kennedy
at
the
last
he
flushed
clenching
his
fists
if
you
can
prove
who
the
murderer
is
kennedy
he
exploded
why
do
you
apprehend
him
before
some
one
else
meets
the
fate
of
werner
i
can
do
nothing
until
i
return
to
my
laboratory
this
afternoon
i
will
not
know
the
identity
of
the
guilty
person
until
i
complete
a
chemical
analysis
one
by
one
the
various
people
possibly
concerned
in
the
two
crimes
joined
the
group
this
morning
all
the
faces
were
serious
most
of
them
showed
the
marks
of
sleeplessness
following
the
second
murder
kennedy
walked
away
but
i
saw
that
jack
gordon
hastened
to
question
both
the
girls
ignoring
their
evident
dislike
for
him
among
the
others
i
recognized
watkins
the
camera
man
and
his
associate
lawrence
millard
came
in
and
hastened
to
the
side
of
enid
as
he
drew
her
away
to
ask
the
cause
of
the
gathering
i
wondered
at
his
early
presence
the
scenario
writer
was
typical
of
them
all
the
strange
and
unusual
nature
of
the
crimes
the
evident
relationship
between
them
had
drawn
the
employees
of
manton
pictures
to
the
studio
as
a
crowd
of
baseball
fans
collects
before
a
public
bulletin
board
not
one
of
them
but
was
afraid
of
missing
some
development
in
the
case
in
no
instance
could
the
interest
of
a
particular
individual
be
taken
as
an
indication
of
guilt
phelps
entered
the
studio
from
the
door
to
the
dressing
rooms
disdaining
to
join
the
other
group
he
approached
us
to
ask
the
cause
for
the
excitement
kennedy
explained
patiently
and
i
saw
that
phelps
looked
at
the
black
bag
uneasily
i
hope
the
guilty
party
is
not
a
member
of
the
company
he
muttered
why
kennedy
mouth
tightened
the
financier
grew
red
because
this
picture
has
been
crippled
enough
first
a
new
star
now
a
new
director
if
it
was
so
preposterous
believe
that
it
was
all
part
of
a
deliberate
he
stopped
as
if
realizing
suddenly
the
inadvisability
of
vague
accusations
do
you
want
justice
done
kennedy
inquired
of
course
phelps
tugged
at
his
collar
uncomfortably
of
course
mr
kennedy
then
he
turned
and
hurried
away
out
of
the
studio
gordon
and
millard
detached
themselves
from
the
others
coming
over
in
which
washroom
was
the
towel
found
mr
kennedy
gordon
put
the
question
as
though
he
felt
himself
specially
delegated
to
obtain
this
information
i
wondered
how
kennedy
would
evade
a
direct
answer
to
my
surprise
he
made
no
attempt
at
concealment
the
one
on
the
second
floor
of
the
office
building
millard
laughed
facing
gordon
that
puts
it
on
myself
or
the
big
boss
it
struck
me
that
the
leading
man
was
uneasy
as
he
hurried
back
to
the
others
millard
still
smiling
turned
to
say
something
to
us
but
we
were
joined
by
manton
entering
from
the
other
end
of
the
big
inclosure
good
morning
the
promoter
exclaimed
somewhat
breathless
i
just
learned
you
were
here
is
is
there
some
new
development
is
there
something
i
can
do
i
see
you
are
not
allowing
anything
to
interfere
with
the
making
of
the
picture
kennedy
remarked
all
the
people
seem
to
be
here
bright
and
early
a
shadow
crept
into
manton
face
it
seems
almost
as
as
as
war
he
admitted
but
i
ca
help
myself
kennedy
the
company
has
no
money
and
if
we
do
meet
this
release
we
busted
all
at
once
he
lowered
his
voice
eagerly
tell
me
have
you
discovered
something
is
there
some
clue
to
the
guilty
man
he
found
a
towel
millard
put
in
an
expression
of
half
amusement
on
his
face
as
he
faced
the
promoter
in
some
way
it
a
clue
to
the
identity
of
the
murderer
an
infallible
clue
he
says
he
found
it
in
the
washroom
by
our
offices
since
werner
is
dead
that
points
the
finger
of
suspicion
at
you
or
me
manton
jaw
dropped
his
expression
became
almost
ludicrous
as
if
the
thought
that
he
could
possibly
be
suspected
himself
was
new
to
him
millard
eyes
sobered
a
bit
at
his
superior
confusion
there
a
door
from
the
dressing
rooms
kennedy
suggested
any
of
the
actors
or
actresses
could
have
used
the
place
of
course
manton
grasped
at
the
straw
i
had
forgotten
there
have
been
complaints
to
me
about
the
players
using
that
room
i
have
the
towel
with
me
wrapped
up
in
a
paper
in
this
grip
kennedy
went
on
it
so
very
valuable
as
a
bit
of
evidence
i
wonder
if
i
could
borrow
a
locker
so
as
to
keep
it
under
lock
and
key
until
ready
to
return
to
the
laboratory
sure
of
course
manton
glanced
about
and
saw
the
little
knot
of
people
still
gathered
in
the
set
millard
go
over
and
tell
kauf
to
get
busy
he
losing
time
then
he
turned
to
us
again
come
on
kennedy
we
have
some
steel
lockers
out
by
the
property
room
as
we
started
across
the
floor
i
could
see
that
kennedy
was
framing
a
question
with
great
care
do
you
ever
use
snakes
in
films
mr
manton
he
asked
why
no
the
promoter
stopped
in
his
surprise
that
is
not
if
we
ever
can
help
it
the
censorship
wo
pass
anything
with
snakes
you
have
used
them
though
yes
once
we
made
a
special
subject
nothing
but
snakes
manton
became
enthusiastic
it
was
a
wonder
too
a
pet
film
of
mine
we
made
it
with
the
direct
and
supervision
of
the
greatest
authority
on
poisonous
snakes
in
the
country
doctor
nagoya
of
castleton
institute
xxvi
a
cigarette
case
kennedy
face
betrayed
only
a
remote
interest
have
you
any
copies
of
that
particular
film
just
the
negative
i
believe
could
i
have
that
for
a
few
days
of
course
manton
seemed
to
wish
to
give
us
every
possible
amount
of
yet
this
request
puzzled
him
would
you
care
to
go
down
to
the
negative
vaults
with
me
kennedy
nodded
first
we
stopped
in
a
lengthy
corridor
in
the
rear
building
where
there
were
no
great
signs
of
life
through
a
door
i
could
see
a
long
room
filled
with
ornaments
pictures
furniture
rugs
and
all
the
vast
freak
collections
of
a
property
room
along
the
side
of
the
hallway
itself
was
a
line
of
steel
lockers
of
recent
design
manton
called
out
to
an
employee
and
he
appeared
after
a
long
wait
and
unlocked
one
of
them
at
kennedy
direction
i
put
the
traveling
bag
in
the
lower
compartment
pocketing
the
key
then
we
retraced
our
steps
to
broad
steel
stairs
leading
up
and
down
we
descended
to
the
basement
and
found
ourselves
in
a
space
immaculately
clean
and
used
generally
for
storage
purposes
the
film
vaults
manton
explained
are
at
the
corner
of
the
west
wing
they
have
to
be
ventilated
specially
on
account
of
the
high
inflammability
of
the
celluloid
composition
since
the
greatest
fire
risk
otherwise
is
the
laboratory
and
printing
departments
and
next
to
that
the
studios
themselves
with
the
scenery
the
heat
of
the
lights
the
wires
we
have
located
them
in
the
most
distant
corner
of
the
quadrangle
the
negative
you
see
represents
our
actual
invested
capital
to
a
considerable
extent
the
prints
wear
out
and
frequently
large
sections
are
destroyed
and
have
to
be
reprinted
then
sometimes
we
can
reissue
old
subjects
all
in
all
we
guard
the
negative
with
the
care
a
bank
would
give
actual
funds
in
its
vaults
in
our
many
visits
to
the
manton
studios
i
had
been
struck
by
the
scrupulous
cleanliness
of
every
part
of
the
place
the
impression
of
orderliness
came
back
to
me
with
redoubled
force
as
we
made
our
way
around
in
the
basement
nothing
seemed
out
of
its
proper
position
although
a
vast
amount
of
various
material
for
picture
making
was
stored
here
we
passed
two
projection
rooms
one
a
miniature
theater
with
quite
a
bit
of
comfort
the
other
small
and
bare
for
the
use
of
directors
and
cutters
finally
we
saw
the
vaults
ahead
of
us
the
walls
were
concrete
matching
the
actual
walls
of
the
basement
there
were
two
entrances
and
the
doors
were
double
of
heavy
steel
arranged
so
that
an
air
space
would
give
protection
in
case
of
fire
at
a
desk
arranged
for
the
use
of
the
clerk
in
charge
of
the
negatives
and
prints
was
a
young
boy
where
wagnalls
demanded
manton
he
went
out
sir
the
boy
replied
respectfully
enough
said
he
would
be
right
back
and
for
me
to
watch
and
not
to
let
anything
get
out
the
promoter
led
the
way
into
the
first
room
here
on
all
four
sides
and
in
several
rows
down
the
center
like
the
racks
in
a
public
library
were
shelves
supporting
stacks
of
square
thin
metal
boxes
or
trays
with
handles
and
tightly
fitting
covers
cards
were
secured
to
the
front
of
each
by
clamps
giving
the
name
of
the
picture
and
the
number
under
which
the
film
was
filed
i
was
surprised
because
i
expected
to
find
everything
kept
in
ordinary
round
film
cans
these
are
the
negatives
manton
explained
he
pulled
out
a
box
at
random
opening
it
the
negative
is
not
all
spliced
together
the
same
length
as
the
reels
of
positive
because
the
printing
machines
are
equipped
to
take
pieces
at
a
time
or
approximate
fifths
of
a
reel
the
size
of
a
roll
of
raw
positive
film
stock
then
whenever
there
is
a
change
in
color
as
from
amber
daylight
to
blue
tint
for
night
the
negative
is
broken
because
pieces
of
different
coloring
have
to
go
through
different
baths
and
that
also
determines
the
size
of
the
rolls
the
prints
or
positives
in
the
other
vaults
are
in
reel
lengths
and
so
are
kept
in
the
round
boxes
in
which
they
are
shipped
kennedy
glanced
about
curiously
the
negative
of
that
snake
picture
is
here
you
said
manton
went
to
a
little
desk
where
there
was
a
card
index
thumbing
through
the
records
he
found
the
number
and
led
us
to
the
proper
place
in
the
rack
in
the
box
were
only
two
rolls
of
negative
both
were
large
this
was
a
split
reel
the
promoter
began
it
was
approximately
four
hundred
feet
and
we
used
it
to
fill
out
a
short
comedy
a
release
we
had
years
ago
a
reel
the
first
part
of
which
was
educational
and
the
last
or
so
a
roaring
we
never
made
money
on
it
but
this
stuff
was
mighty
good
kennedy
we
practically
wrote
a
scenario
for
those
reptiles
doctor
nagoya
was
down
himself
and
for
the
better
part
of
a
day
it
was
possible
to
get
a
woman
in
the
studio
for
fear
a
rattler
or
something
might
get
loose
were
there
rattlers
in
the
film
altogether
i
think
the
little
jap
was
interesting
too
between
scenes
he
told
us
all
about
the
reptiles
and
how
their
poison
manton
checked
himself
confused
was
it
because
the
thought
of
poison
reminded
him
of
the
two
deaths
so
close
to
him
or
was
it
from
some
more
potent
twinge
of
conscience
you
see
it
all
in
the
film
he
finished
lamely
i
may
keep
these
for
a
little
bit
kennedy
asked
of
course
i
can
have
the
two
rolls
printed
and
developed
and
dry
sometime
this
afternoon
if
you
wish
no
this
will
do
very
well
kennedy
slipped
a
roll
in
each
pocket
straining
the
cloth
to
get
them
in
manton
opened
a
book
on
the
little
table
making
an
entry
of
the
delivery
of
the
rolls
and
adding
his
own
initials
i
have
to
be
very
careful
to
avoid
the
loss
of
negative
he
told
us
nothing
can
be
taken
out
of
here
except
on
my
own
personal
order
i
thought
that
manton
was
very
frank
and
accommodating
surely
he
had
made
no
effort
to
conceal
his
knowledge
of
this
film
made
with
doctor
nagoya
and
he
had
even
mentioned
the
poison
of
the
rattlesnakes
though
it
had
confused
him
for
a
brief
moment
that
had
not
struck
me
as
a
very
decisive
indication
of
guilty
knowledge
after
all
no
one
knew
of
the
use
of
crotalin
to
kill
stella
lamar
except
the
murderer
himself
and
kennedy
and
those
of
us
in
his
confidence
the
murderer
might
not
guess
that
kennedy
had
identified
the
venom
yet
if
manton
were
that
man
he
had
covered
his
feelings
wonderfully
in
telling
us
about
the
film
my
thoughts
strayed
to
the
towel
upstairs
had
an
attempt
been
made
yet
to
steal
it
from
the
locker
it
seemed
to
me
that
we
were
losing
too
much
time
down
here
if
we
hoped
to
notice
anyone
with
itching
hands
i
realized
that
kennedy
had
been
very
clever
in
including
all
our
suspects
in
hearing
at
the
time
he
revealed
the
importance
of
the
clue
of
the
original
nine
listed
by
mackay
werner
was
dead
and
manton
had
never
entered
the
case
enid
we
had
assumed
to
be
the
mysterious
woman
in
millard
divorce
however
and
the
other
six
had
all
been
upon
the
floor
in
contact
with
kennedy
first
there
was
marilyn
the
woman
then
the
five
men
in
order
had
displayed
a
lively
interest
in
the
towel
shirley
gordon
millard
phelps
and
manton
kennedy
voice
roused
me
from
my
reverie
does
this
door
lead
through
to
the
other
vaults
mr
manton
yes
the
promoter
straightened
after
replacing
the
records
of
the
negative
i
designed
this
system
of
storage
myself
and
superintended
every
detail
of
construction
it
is
he
checked
himself
with
an
exclamation
noticing
that
the
door
was
open
with
a
flush
of
anger
he
slammed
it
shut
i
should
think
the
connecting
doors
would
be
kept
shut
all
the
time
kennedy
remarked
in
case
of
fire
only
one
compartment
would
be
a
loss
that
the
idea
exactly
that
why
i
was
on
the
point
of
swearing
the
boys
down
here
are
getting
lax
and
i
going
to
make
trouble
manton
turned
back
and
called
to
the
boy
outside
where
did
you
say
wagnalls
went
i
do
know
sir
sometimes
he
goes
across
to
mccann
for
a
cup
of
coffee
or
maybe
he
went
up
to
the
printing
department
manton
faced
us
once
more
if
you
excuse
me
just
a
moment
i
going
to
see
who
responsible
for
this
why
he
sputtered
if
you
called
me
around
the
rack
i
would
have
noticed
that
the
door
was
open
and
then
if
there
had
been
a
fire
i
i
be
right
back
as
manton
stormed
off
kennedy
smiled
slightly
then
nodded
for
me
to
follow
we
passed
through
into
the
rooms
for
positive
storage
these
in
turn
had
fireproof
connecting
doors
all
of
which
were
open
in
each
case
kennedy
closed
them
eventually
we
emerged
into
the
main
part
of
the
basement
through
the
farther
vault
door
nothing
of
a
suspicious
nature
had
caught
our
attention
i
guessed
that
kennedy
simply
had
wished
to
cover
the
carelessness
of
the
vault
man
in
leaving
the
inner
doors
wide
open
at
the
entrance
which
had
first
admitted
us
to
the
negative
room
however
kennedy
stooped
suddenly
at
the
very
moment
he
bent
forward
i
caught
the
glint
of
something
bright
behind
the
heavy
steel
door
and
in
the
shadow
so
that
it
had
escaped
us
before
as
he
rose
i
leaned
over
it
was
a
cigarette
case
a
very
handsome
one
with
large
initials
engraved
with
deep
skillful
flourish
who
is
kennedy
asked
i
felt
a
quiver
of
excitement
jack
gordon
the
leading
man
what
an
actor
doing
down
in
the
film
vaults
he
muttered
slipping
the
case
into
his
pocket
he
glanced
about
on
the
floor
and
something
just
within
the
negative
room
caught
his
eye
once
more
he
bent
down
with
a
speculative
expression
he
picked
up
the
stub
of
a
cigarette
at
this
instant
manton
returned
breathing
hard
as
though
his
pursuit
of
the
missing
wagnalls
had
been
very
determined
the
butt
in
fingers
attracted
his
attention
at
once
did
did
you
find
that
here
he
demanded
kennedy
pointed
right
there
on
the
floor
the
devil
manton
flushed
red
this
is
no
place
to
smoke
by
by
all
the
wives
of
goodwin
and
all
the
stars
of
griffith
i
going
to
start
firing
a
few
people
he
sputtered
here
sonny
he
jumped
at
the
boy
frightening
him
close
all
these
doors
and
turn
the
combinations
tell
wagnalls
if
he
opens
them
before
he
sees
me
i
commit
battery
on
his
nose
kennedy
continued
to
hold
the
stub
and
as
manton
preceded
us
up
the
stairs
he
hung
back
comparing
it
with
the
few
cigarettes
left
in
the
case
unquestionably
they
were
of
the
same
brand
on
the
studio
floor
mackay
was
waiting
for
us
under
his
arm
was
a
reel
of
film
in
a
can
he
clutched
it
almost
fondly
all
ready
he
remarked
to
kennedy
kennedy
face
was
unrevealing
as
he
faced
manton
this
bit
of
film
is
valuable
evidence
also
i
think
perhaps
it
would
be
safer
in
that
locker
anything
at
all
we
can
do
to
help
stated
manton
promptly
shall
i
show
you
the
way
again
i
produced
the
key
handing
it
to
kennedy
as
the
four
of
us
arrived
in
the
corridor
by
the
property
room
kennedy
slipped
the
bit
of
metal
into
the
lock
then
simulated
surprise
very
well
indeed
the
lock
is
broken
he
exclaimed
some
one
has
been
here
apparently
the
traveling
bag
had
been
undisturbed
as
we
took
it
out
nevertheless
the
paper
containing
the
towel
was
gone
this
is
no
joke
kennedy
protested
manton
in
indignation
where
can
i
hire
about
a
dozen
good
men
to
hang
around
and
watch
and
and
help
you
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
mackay
without
releasing
his
grasp
of
the
film
had
been
inspecting
the
broken
lock
look
at
the
way
this
was
done
he
murmured
almost
in
admiration
this
was
the
work
of
any
roughneck
it
it
was
a
dainty
job
xxvii
the
film
fire
the
bag
lay
open
at
my
feet
the
microscope
and
other
paraphernalia
brought
by
kennedy
were
untouched
taking
the
film
from
mackay
and
placing
the
can
in
with
the
other
things
kennedy
snapped
the
catch
and
turned
to
me
as
he
straightened
i
think
our
evidence
is
safest
in
plain
sight
walter
we
carry
it
about
with
us
lloyd
manton
seemed
to
be
a
genuinely
unhappy
individual
after
some
moments
he
excused
himself
nervously
anxious
about
the
turn
of
affairs
at
the
studio
immediately
i
faced
kennedy
and
mackay
manton
the
only
one
who
knew
just
where
we
put
the
bag
i
remarked
when
he
left
us
in
the
basement
he
had
plenty
of
time
to
run
up
and
steal
the
towel
and
return
how
about
the
itching
salve
in
his
hurry
he
might
have
left
the
towel
in
the
paper
intending
to
destroy
it
later
kennedy
frowned
that
possible
walter
i
had
not
thought
of
that
still
he
brightened
i
counting
on
human
nature
i
do
believe
anyone
guilty
of
the
crime
could
have
that
towel
in
his
possession
after
the
hints
i
have
thrown
out
without
examining
it
so
as
to
see
what
telltale
mark
or
stain
would
be
apt
to
betray
his
identity
you
can
see
that
manton
the
logical
man
it
would
be
easy
for
anyone
else
to
follow
and
observe
us
then
first
of
all
we
must
keep
an
eye
out
for
any
person
showing
signs
of
the
itching
concoction
we
must
observe
anyone
with
noticeably
clean
hands
principally
however
another
thing
worries
me
what
that
mr
kennedy
asked
mackay
walter
and
i
found
a
cigarette
case
belonging
to
jack
gordon
in
the
basement
also
a
butt
smoked
of
the
way
down
and
left
directly
in
the
negative
room
the
fire
doors
between
the
different
film
vaults
which
are
arranged
like
the
safety
compartments
in
a
ship
were
all
open
i
want
to
know
why
gordon
was
down
there
and
well
i
seem
to
sense
something
wrong
good
heavens
craig
i
interposed
you
do
attach
any
importance
to
the
fact
that
those
doors
were
open
walter
in
a
case
of
real
mystery
the
slightest
derangement
of
matters
of
ordinary
routine
is
a
cause
for
suspicion
i
had
no
answer
and
as
we
the
studio
i
devoted
my
attention
to
the
various
people
we
had
tabulated
as
possible
suspects
noticing
that
kennedy
and
mackay
did
likewise
jack
gordon
was
in
the
ballroom
scene
in
kauf
still
was
concerned
with
technical
details
of
the
set
and
lighting
and
although
the
cameras
were
set
up
they
were
not
in
proper
place
nor
was
either
camera
man
in
evidence
with
gordon
was
enid
from
a
distance
they
seemed
to
be
engaged
in
an
argument
of
real
magnitude
there
was
no
mistaking
the
dislike
on
the
part
of
each
for
the
other
marilyn
was
the
most
uneasy
of
all
of
the
principals
she
was
pacing
up
and
down
glancing
about
in
frank
distress
of
mind
i
looked
at
her
hands
and
saw
that
she
had
crushed
a
tube
of
grease
paint
in
her
nervousness
not
only
her
fingers
were
soiled
but
there
were
streaks
on
her
arms
where
she
had
smeared
herself
unconsciously
as
we
watched
she
left
the
studio
hurrying
out
the
door
without
a
backward
glance
marilyn
at
least
showed
no
indications
of
the
salve
nor
of
painfully
recent
acquaintance
with
water
both
manton
and
phelps
were
in
evidence
decidedly
so
i
imagined
from
the
viewpoint
of
poor
kauf
manton
at
the
heels
of
his
new
director
was
doing
all
he
could
to
help
phelps
following
manton
about
seemed
to
be
urging
haste
upon
the
promoter
the
result
was
far
from
advantageous
to
picture
making
it
was
concentrated
distraction
millard
was
poring
over
the
manuscript
perched
upon
a
chair
the
wrong
way
so
that
its
back
would
serve
as
a
desk
engaged
busily
in
making
changes
here
and
there
in
the
pages
with
a
pencil
like
any
author
it
was
never
too
late
for
minor
improvements
and
suggestions
i
doubt
but
that
if
manton
had
permitted
it
millard
would
have
been
quite
apt
to
interrupt
a
scene
in
the
taking
in
order
to
add
some
little
touch
occurring
to
him
as
his
action
sprang
to
life
in
the
interpretation
of
players
and
director
at
any
rate
his
hands
seemed
more
clean
than
those
of
either
manton
or
phelps
proving
nothing
because
he
was
at
a
task
not
so
apt
to
bring
him
into
contact
with
dirt
shirley
is
missing
observed
the
district
attorney
in
an
undertone
kennedy
faced
me
give
the
bag
to
mackay
walter
while
he
keeps
an
eye
on
the
people
up
here
we
pay
a
visit
to
shirley
dressing
room
and
after
that
go
down
to
the
basement
again
i
ca
account
for
it
intuition
perhaps
but
i
sure
something
wrong
the
heavy
man
dressing
room
pointed
out
to
us
by
some
employee
passing
through
the
hall
was
empty
i
led
the
way
into
quarters
but
again
no
one
was
about
in
each
case
kennedy
made
a
quick
visual
search
for
the
towel
without
result
we
did
not
dare
linger
and
run
the
risk
of
giving
away
our
trick
then
too
kennedy
was
nervously
anxious
to
look
through
the
basement
once
more
i
do
understand
your
suspicion
of
the
state
of
affairs
in
the
film
vaults
i
confessed
why
should
jack
gordon
the
leading
man
be
down
there
he
countered
that
that
really
is
a
cause
for
suspicion
is
it
now
walter
think
a
bit
we
were
crossing
the
yard
and
so
not
apt
to
be
overheard
granting
that
gordon
actually
had
been
down
there
why
should
the
fact
concern
us
manton
explained
that
no
negative
or
positive
can
be
given
out
except
upon
order
there
is
nothing
down
there
but
film
and
so
no
other
errand
to
bring
the
leading
man
to
the
vault
except
to
get
some
scenes
or
pieces
showing
his
own
work
and
that
is
likely
unless
i
interrupted
gordon
is
the
guilty
man
and
wanted
to
get
the
snake
film
before
we
did
how
could
that
be
when
we
asked
manton
about
the
doctor
nagoya
subject
we
went
right
down
with
him
and
procured
it
i
doubt
anyone
could
have
overheard
us
as
we
talked
about
it
in
any
case
remember
craig
we
went
to
the
locker
first
and
it
was
some
little
time
before
that
fellow
came
out
to
unlock
it
and
give
us
the
key
and
when
you
questioned
manton
we
were
passing
right
by
all
of
them
any
one
could
have
heard
the
mention
of
the
snake
film
kennedy
frowned
i
believe
you
right
walter
or
it
is
possible
that
the
guilty
person
believed
that
the
scenes
taken
out
at
tarrytown
or
those
taken
when
werner
died
revealed
something
and
so
would
have
to
be
stolen
or
destroyed
and
that
they
were
kept
in
the
vault
it
is
even
possible
a
gleam
came
into
kennedy
eyes
it
is
even
possible
that
the
mind
smart
enough
to
reason
out
the
damaging
nature
of
the
chemical
analyses
i
was
making
and
clever
enough
to
utilize
an
explosive
bullet
in
an
effort
to
destroy
the
fruits
of
my
work
would
also
have
the
foresight
to
anticipate
me
and
to
realize
that
i
might
guess
the
existence
of
a
film
showing
snakes
and
suggesting
the
use
of
venom
it
damning
to
gordon
all
right
i
said
on
the
contrary
walter
kennedy
lowered
his
voice
as
we
entered
the
building
across
the
quadrangle
and
descended
stairs
leading
directly
into
the
basement
we
have
mentioned
over
and
over
again
the
cleverness
of
our
unknown
criminal
that
man
or
woman
never
would
drop
a
cigarette
case
with
his
or
her
initials
and
leave
without
it
nor
smoke
a
cigarette
in
a
place
he
or
she
was
not
supposed
to
be
what
then
it
a
plant
a
deliberate
plant
to
throw
suspicion
upon
gordon
why
upon
gordon
i
do
know
that
unless
because
gordon
is
supposed
to
have
the
best
possible
motive
for
killing
miss
lamar
his
money
troubles
and
so
becomes
the
logical
man
to
throw
the
guilt
upon
as
a
matter
of
fact
craig
why
should
the
finding
of
that
cigarette
case
be
a
cause
for
suspicion
at
all
that
what
i
did
understand
before
ordinarily
it
would
be
but
those
open
inner
doors
the
absence
of
the
man
in
charge
is
it
possible
that
we
interrupted
an
attempt
not
only
to
search
for
the
particular
damaging
pieces
of
film
but
perhaps
to
destroy
the
whole
if
some
one
acted
between
the
time
i
asked
manton
about
the
snake
film
and
the
moment
we
arrived
in
the
basement
to
get
it
that
some
one
had
to
move
very
fast
in
which
case
it
might
have
been
gordon
after
all
the
cigarette
stub
may
have
been
thrown
in
lighted
to
start
a
fire
he
may
not
have
had
time
to
pick
up
the
case
not
knowing
just
where
he
dropped
it
kennedy
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
all
shows
the
futility
of
trying
to
arrive
at
a
conclusion
without
definite
facts
that
is
where
science
is
superior
to
deduction
it
all
a
maze
to
me
just
now
i
agreed
we
made
our
way
to
the
vaults
in
silence
and
to
our
surprise
found
that
they
were
closed
and
that
even
the
boy
was
gone
now
the
cellar
as
a
whole
probably
for
the
purpose
of
fire
protection
on
a
larger
scale
was
divided
into
sections
corresponding
to
the
units
of
the
buildings
above
and
this
time
i
noticed
that
the
door
through
which
we
had
arrived
before
was
closed
also
had
manton
taken
fright
in
earnest
at
the
possibility
of
fire
or
had
he
given
his
employees
a
genuine
scare
we
retraced
our
steps
to
the
yard
and
there
the
alert
eye
of
kennedy
detected
a
slinking
figure
just
as
a
man
darted
into
the
protection
of
a
doorway
it
was
shirley
had
he
been
watching
us
was
he
connected
in
some
way
with
the
vague
mystery
kennedy
seemed
to
sense
in
connection
with
the
basement
and
the
film
vaults
kennedy
led
the
way
to
the
entrance
where
shirley
had
disappeared
here
there
was
no
sign
of
him
only
steps
leading
up
and
down
and
the
open
door
to
a
huge
developing
room
returning
to
the
yard
we
caught
a
gesture
from
the
chauffeur
of
a
car
standing
near
by
and
recognized
mcgroarty
the
driver
who
had
found
the
ampulla
a
few
days
previously
excuse
me
kennedy
he
apologized
as
we
approached
i
should
have
come
to
you
instead
of
making
you
two
walk
over
to
me
but
less
suspicious
this
way
what
do
you
mean
you
recognize
me
mcgroarty
the
chauffeur
as
found
the
little
bottle
kennedy
nodded
well
i
says
to
myself
i
ought
to
tell
you
but
i
do
like
to
because
it
might
be
nothing
you
know
it
might
prove
very
valuable
mcgroarty
kennedy
wanted
to
encourage
him
well
i
been
sitting
here
for
an
hour
i
guess
one
of
the
other
directors
is
going
out
and
his
people
are
late
and
so
here
i
am
well
i
do
like
the
way
the
heavy
man
werner
had
shirley
merle
shirley
i
spoke
up
that
him
well
he
been
hanging
and
snooping
around
that
building
over
there
where
you
just
saw
him
for
twenty
minutes
or
more
i
guess
he
gone
in
and
out
of
that
basement
a
dozen
times
i
says
to
myself
maybe
he
up
to
something
you
know
how
it
is
kennedy
glanced
at
me
significantly
then
he
extended
his
hand
to
the
chauffeur
again
i
thank
you
mcgroarty
as
i
said
before
i
forget
you
now
what
i
asked
as
we
drew
away
shirley
dressing
room
and
the
studio
floor
and
mackay
as
we
rather
expected
the
heavy
man
quarters
were
deserted
i
thought
that
kennedy
would
stop
now
to
make
a
careful
search
but
he
seemed
anxious
to
compare
notes
with
the
district
attorney
nothing
here
reported
mackay
shirley
has
been
a
sign
of
him
i
looked
about
the
moment
we
arrived
under
the
big
glass
roof
marilyn
loring
i
inquired
she
been
missing
too
all
at
once
mackay
grinned
broadly
you
know
either
there
no
efficiency
in
making
moving
pictures
at
all
or
these
people
have
all
gone
more
or
less
out
of
their
heads
as
the
result
of
the
two
tragedies
look
he
pointed
when
you
left
me
phelps
and
manton
were
stepping
on
each
other
toes
trying
to
help
that
new
director
and
about
half
driving
him
crazy
and
now
millard
seems
to
have
figured
out
some
new
way
of
handling
the
action
and
over
in
the
thick
of
it
it
worse
than
bedlam
and
better
than
a
chaplin
comedy
i
was
compelled
to
smile
although
i
knew
that
this
was
not
uncommon
in
picture
studios
manton
phelps
millard
and
kauf
were
in
the
center
of
the
group
all
talking
at
once
clustered
about
i
saw
enid
and
gordon
both
camera
men
and
a
miniature
mob
of
extra
people
but
as
i
looked
little
kauf
seemed
to
come
to
the
end
of
his
patience
in
an
instant
or
two
he
demonstrated
real
generalship
shutting
up
manton
and
the
banker
and
millard
with
a
grin
but
with
sharp
words
and
a
quick
gesture
which
showed
that
he
meant
it
he
called
to
the
others
gathered
about
clearing
the
set
of
all
but
enid
and
gordon
he
sent
the
camera
men
to
their
places
then
confronted
phelps
and
manton
and
the
scenario
writer
once
more
we
could
not
hear
his
words
but
could
see
that
he
was
asserting
himself
was
forcing
a
decision
so
that
he
could
proceed
with
his
work
this
seemed
uninteresting
to
me
i
remembered
my
success
in
my
visit
to
werner
apartment
when
i
had
essayed
the
role
of
detective
listen
kennedy
i
suggested
suppose
i
go
out
by
myself
and
see
if
i
can
locate
shirley
or
marilyn
everyone
else
is
right
here
where
you
can
at
that
instant
a
deafening
explosion
shook
the
studio
and
every
building
about
the
quadrangle
the
sound
echoing
and
with
the
sharpness
of
a
terrific
thunderclap
mixed
with
the
reverberations
which
were
intensified
by
the
high
arch
of
the
studio
roof
were
the
screams
of
women
and
the
frightened
calls
of
men
following
immediately
upon
the
first
roar
were
the
muffled
sounds
of
additional
explosions
persisting
for
a
matter
of
ten
to
fifteen
seconds
with
every
detonation
the
floor
beneath
our
feet
trembled
and
rocked
several
flats
of
scenery
stacked
against
a
wall
at
our
rear
toppled
forward
and
struck
the
floor
with
a
resounding
whack
not
unlike
some
gigantic
one
entire
side
of
the
banquet
set
luckily
unoccupied
fell
inward
and
i
caught
the
sound
as
the
dainty
gold
chairs
and
fragile
tables
snapped
and
were
crushed
as
so
much
kindling
wood
then
a
fitting
climax
of
destruction
withheld
until
this
moment
there
followed
the
terrifying
snap
of
steel
from
above
an
entire
section
of
roof
literally
was
popped
from
place
the
result
of
false
stresses
in
the
beams
created
by
the
explosion
upon
the
heads
of
the
unlucky
group
in
the
center
of
the
ballroom
set
came
a
perfect
hailstorm
of
broken
and
shattered
bits
of
heavy
ground
glass
for
an
instant
an
exceedingly
brief
instant
there
was
the
illusion
of
silence
the
next
moment
the
factory
siren
rose
to
a
shrill
shriek
with
a
full
head
of
steam
behind
it
the
fire
call
kennedy
dashed
over
to
the
scene
where
those
beneath
the
shower
of
glass
lay
dazed
and
uncertain
of
the
extent
of
their
own
injuries
where
are
the
kits
he
shouted
bring
cotton
and
bandages
and
and
telephone
for
a
doctor
an
ambulance
it
seemed
to
me
that
kennedy
had
never
been
so
excited
mackay
and
i
at
his
heels
and
some
of
the
others
unhurt
hurriedly
helped
the
various
victims
to
their
feet
then
we
realized
that
by
some
miracle
some
freak
of
fate
no
one
had
been
hurt
seriously
already
a
property
boy
was
at
kennedy
side
with
a
huge
box
marked
prominently
with
the
red
cross
inside
was
everything
necessary
and
kennedy
started
to
bind
up
the
wounds
with
all
the
skill
of
a
professional
physician
mackay
he
whispered
hurry
and
get
me
some
envelopes
or
some
sheets
of
paper
anything
quick
and
to
me
before
i
could
grasp
the
reason
for
that
puzzling
request
do
let
anyone
slip
away
walter
no
matter
what
happens
i
must
bind
up
these
wounds
myself
a
few
moments
later
i
understood
what
kennedy
was
up
to
as
he
finished
with
each
victim
he
took
some
bit
of
cotton
or
gauze
with
which
he
had
wiped
their
cuts
enough
blood
to
serve
him
in
chemical
analysis
and
handed
it
to
mackay
the
district
attorney
very
unobtrusively
slipped
each
sample
into
a
separate
envelope
sealing
it
and
marking
it
with
a
hieroglyph
which
he
would
be
able
to
identify
later
in
this
fashion
kennedy
secured
blood
smears
of
manton
and
phelps
millard
and
kauf
and
enid
gordon
the
two
camera
men
and
a
scene
shifter
i
smiled
to
myself
meanwhile
a
bitter
acrid
odor
penetrated
through
the
windows
and
to
every
part
of
the
structure
the
odor
of
burning
film
an
odor
one
never
forgets
to
fear
all
those
uninjured
in
the
explosions
had
rushed
out
to
see
the
fire
or
else
to
escape
from
any
further
danger
the
moment
they
recovered
their
wits
manton
only
cut
at
the
wrist
and
impatient
as
kennedy
cleaned
dusted
and
bound
the
wound
was
the
first
to
receive
attention
the
vaults
he
called
to
the
men
who
seemed
disposed
to
linger
about
for
god
sake
get
busy
the
next
instant
he
was
gone
himself
enid
was
cut
on
the
head
tears
streamed
from
her
eyes
as
she
clung
to
kennedy
coat
trembling
will
it
make
a
scar
she
sobbed
will
i
be
unable
to
act
before
the
camera
any
more
he
reassured
her
in
the
case
of
millard
who
had
several
bad
scalp
wounds
he
advised
a
trip
to
a
doctor
but
the
scenario
writer
laughed
phelps
was
yellow
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
whimpered
a
bit
gordon
was
disposed
to
swear
cheerfully
although
a
point
of
glass
had
penetrated
deep
in
his
shoulder
and
another
piece
had
gashed
him
across
the
forehead
finally
kennedy
was
through
he
packed
the
little
envelopes
in
the
bag
still
in
the
possession
of
mackay
and
added
the
two
rolls
of
film
from
his
pocket
then
for
the
first
time
he
locked
it
as
he
straightened
his
eyes
narrowed
now
for
shirley
he
muttered
and
marilyn
i
added
xxviii
the
phosphorus
bomb
we
rushed
out
into
the
courtyard
kennedy
in
the
lead
mackay
trailing
with
the
bag
here
there
were
dense
clouds
of
fine
white
suffocating
smoke
mixed
with
steam
and
signs
of
the
utmost
confusion
on
every
hand
because
manton
fortunately
had
trained
the
studio
staff
through
frequent
fire
drills
there
was
a
semblance
of
order
among
the
men
actually
engaged
in
fighting
the
spread
of
the
blaze
any
attempt
to
extinguish
the
conflagration
in
the
vault
itself
was
hopeless
however
and
so
the
workers
contented
themselves
with
pouring
water
into
the
basement
on
either
side
to
keep
the
building
and
perhaps
the
other
vaults
cool
and
with
maintaining
a
constant
stream
of
chemical
mixture
from
a
special
apparatus
down
the
ventilating
system
into
and
upon
the
smoldering
film
the
studio
fire
equipment
seemed
to
be
very
complete
there
was
water
at
high
pressure
from
a
tank
elevated
some
twenty
to
thirty
feet
above
the
uppermost
roof
of
the
quadrangle
in
addition
manton
had
invested
in
the
chemical
engine
and
also
in
sand
carts
because
water
aids
rather
than
retards
the
combustion
of
film
itself
i
noticed
that
the
promoter
was
in
direct
charge
of
the
and
that
he
moved
about
with
a
zeal
and
a
recklessness
which
ended
for
once
and
all
in
my
mind
the
suspicion
that
phelps
might
be
correct
and
that
manton
sought
to
wreck
this
company
for
the
sake
of
fortune
features
in
an
amazingly
quick
space
of
time
the
thing
was
over
when
the
city
apparatus
arrived
after
a
run
of
nearly
three
miles
there
was
nothing
for
them
to
do
the
chief
sought
out
manton
to
accompany
him
upon
an
inspection
of
the
damage
and
to
make
sure
that
the
fire
was
out
the
promoter
first
beckoned
to
kennedy
this
is
unquestionably
of
incendiary
origin
he
explained
to
the
chief
i
want
kennedy
to
see
everything
before
it
is
disturbed
so
that
no
clue
may
be
lost
or
destroyed
the
fire
officer
brightened
craig
kennedy
he
inquired
gee
there
must
be
some
connection
between
the
blaze
and
the
murder
of
stella
lamar
and
her
director
i
been
reading
about
it
every
day
in
the
papers
jameson
of
the
star
kennedy
said
presenting
me
we
found
we
could
not
enter
the
basement
immediately
adjoining
the
vaults
that
is
directly
from
the
courtyard
because
it
seemed
advisable
to
keep
a
stream
of
water
playing
down
the
steps
and
a
resulting
cloud
of
steam
blocked
us
manton
explained
that
we
could
get
through
from
the
next
cellar
if
it
was
not
too
hot
and
so
we
hurried
toward
another
entrance
mackay
who
had
remained
behind
to
protect
the
bag
from
the
heat
joined
us
there
i
put
the
bag
in
charge
of
that
chauffeur
mcgroarty
and
armed
him
with
my
automatic
he
explained
he
paused
to
wipe
his
eyes
the
fumes
from
the
film
had
distressed
all
of
us
shirley
and
marilyn
loring
are
both
missing
still
he
added
i
been
asking
everyone
about
them
no
one
has
seen
them
the
fire
chief
looked
up
everyone
is
out
you
are
sure
everybody
is
safe
i
had
wagnalls
at
my
elbow
with
a
hose
manton
replied
i
saw
the
boy
around
also
no
one
else
had
any
business
down
there
and
the
vaults
were
closed
and
the
cellar
shut
off
the
door
leading
from
the
adjoining
basement
was
hot
yet
but
not
so
that
we
were
unable
to
handle
it
however
the
catch
had
stuck
and
it
took
considerable
effort
to
force
it
in
as
we
did
so
a
cloud
of
acrid
vapor
and
steam
drove
us
back
then
kennedy
seemed
to
detect
something
in
the
slowly
clearing
atmosphere
he
rushed
ahead
without
hesitation
the
fire
chief
followed
in
another
instant
i
was
able
to
see
also
the
form
of
a
woman
dimly
outlined
in
the
vapor
struggled
to
lift
the
prone
figure
of
a
man
after
one
effort
she
collapsed
upon
him
i
dashed
forward
as
did
mackay
and
manton
two
of
them
carried
the
girl
out
to
the
air
the
other
three
of
us
brought
her
unconscious
companion
it
was
marilyn
and
shirley
the
little
actress
was
revived
easily
but
shirley
required
the
combined
efforts
of
kennedy
and
the
chief
and
it
was
evident
that
he
had
escaped
death
from
suffocation
only
by
the
narrowest
of
margins
how
either
had
survived
seemed
a
mystery
their
clothes
were
wet
their
faces
and
hands
blackened
eyebrows
and
lashes
scorched
by
the
heat
but
for
the
water
poured
into
the
basement
neither
would
have
been
alive
they
had
been
prisoners
during
the
entire
conflagration
the
burning
vault
holding
them
at
one
end
of
the
basement
the
door
in
the
partition
resisting
their
efforts
to
open
it
thank
heaven
he
alive
were
marilyn
first
words
how
did
you
get
in
the
cellar
kennedy
spoke
sternly
i
thought
he
might
be
there
now
that
the
reaction
was
setting
in
the
girl
was
faint
and
she
controlled
herself
with
difficulty
i
was
looking
for
him
and
as
soon
as
i
heard
the
first
explosion
i
ran
down
the
steps
into
the
entrance
i
was
right
near
there
and
i
found
him
stunned
i
started
to
lift
him
but
there
were
other
explosions
almost
before
i
got
to
his
side
the
flames
shot
out
through
the
cracks
in
the
vault
door
and
i
i
could
drag
him
to
the
steps
i
had
to
pull
him
back
where
you
found
us
she
began
to
tremble
it
it
was
terrible
was
there
anyone
else
about
anyone
but
mr
shirley
no
i
i
remember
i
wondered
about
the
vault
man
what
was
shirley
down
there
for
miss
loring
he
she
hesitated
he
said
he
had
seen
some
one
hanging
around
and
and
he
did
want
to
report
anything
until
he
was
sure
he
he
thought
he
could
accomplish
more
by
himself
although
i
told
him
he
was
was
wrong
whom
did
he
see
hanging
around
he
would
tell
me
shirley
was
too
weak
to
question
and
the
girl
too
unstrung
to
stand
further
interrogation
in
response
to
manton
call
several
people
came
up
and
willingly
helped
the
two
toward
the
comfort
of
their
dressing
rooms
at
the
fire
chief
suggestion
the
stream
of
water
into
the
basement
was
cut
off
manton
led
the
way
choking
eyes
watering
to
the
front
of
the
vaults
feverishly
he
felt
the
steel
doors
and
the
walls
there
was
no
mistaking
the
conclusion
the
negative
vault
was
hot
the
others
cold
the
devil
manton
exclaimed
a
deep
poignancy
in
his
voice
made
the
expression
childishly
inadequate
why
could
it
have
been
the
prints
suddenly
he
began
to
sob
that
the
finish
not
one
of
our
subjects
can
ever
be
worked
again
it
a
loss
of
half
a
million
dollars
if
you
have
positives
kennedy
asked
ca
you
make
new
negatives
dupes
manton
looked
up
in
scorn
did
you
ever
see
a
print
from
a
dupe
negative
it
terrible
looks
like
some
one
left
it
out
in
the
wet
overnight
how
about
the
terror
i
inquired
all
of
that
in
the
safe
in
the
printing
room
that
and
the
two
current
five
reelers
of
the
other
companies
we
wo
lose
our
releases
but
again
there
was
a
catch
in
his
voice
we
could
have
cleared
thousands
and
thousands
of
dollars
on
reissues
all
all
of
stella
negative
is
gone
too
to
my
amazement
he
began
to
cry
without
attempt
at
concealment
it
was
something
new
to
me
in
the
way
of
temperament
first
they
kill
her
and
now
now
they
destroy
the
photographic
record
which
would
have
let
her
live
for
those
who
loved
her
the
his
voice
trailed
away
to
the
merest
whisper
as
he
seemed
to
collapse
against
the
hot
smoked
wall
the
devil
the
fire
chief
took
charge
of
the
job
of
breaking
into
the
vault
first
wagnalls
attempted
to
open
the
combination
of
the
farther
door
but
the
heat
had
put
the
tumblers
out
of
commission
returning
to
the
entrance
of
the
negative
vault
itself
the
thin
steel
manufactured
for
fire
rather
than
burglar
protection
was
punctured
and
the
bolts
driven
back
a
cloud
of
noxious
fumes
greeted
the
workers
and
delayed
them
but
they
persisted
finally
the
door
fell
out
with
a
crash
and
men
were
set
to
fanning
fresh
air
into
the
interior
while
a
piece
of
chemical
apparatus
was
held
in
readiness
for
any
further
outbreak
of
the
conflagration
manton
regained
control
of
himself
in
time
to
be
one
of
the
first
to
enter
mackay
held
back
but
the
fire
chief
the
promoter
kennedy
and
myself
fashioned
impromptu
gasmasks
of
wet
handkerchiefs
and
braved
the
hot
atmosphere
inside
the
room
the
damage
was
irremediable
the
steel
frames
of
the
racks
the
cheaper
metal
of
the
boxes
the
residue
of
the
burning
film
all
constituted
a
hideous
shapeless
mass
clinging
against
the
sides
and
in
the
corners
and
about
the
floor
only
one
section
of
the
room
retained
the
slightest
suggestion
of
its
original
condition
the
little
table
and
the
boxes
of
negative
records
the
edges
of
the
racks
which
had
stood
at
either
side
showed
something
of
their
former
shape
and
purpose
this
was
directly
beneath
the
ventilating
opening
here
the
chemical
mixture
pumped
in
to
extinguish
the
fire
had
preserved
them
to
that
extent
all
at
once
kennedy
nudged
the
fire
chief
put
out
your
torch
he
directed
sharply
in
the
darkness
there
slowly
appeared
here
and
there
on
the
walls
a
ghostly
bluish
glow
persisting
in
spite
of
the
coating
of
soot
on
everything
kennedy
keen
eye
had
caught
the
hint
of
it
while
the
electric
torch
had
been
flashed
into
some
corner
and
away
for
a
moment
radium
i
exclaimed
entirely
without
thought
kennedy
laughed
hardly
but
it
is
phosphorus
without
question
what
do
you
make
of
that
the
fire
chief
was
curious
let
get
out
was
kennedy
reply
indeed
it
was
almost
impossible
for
us
to
keep
our
eyes
open
because
of
the
smarting
and
more
the
odor
was
nauseating
a
guard
was
posted
and
in
the
courtyard
disregarding
the
curious
crowd
about
kennedy
asked
for
wagnalls
and
began
to
question
him
when
did
you
close
the
vaults
about
two
hours
before
the
fire
manton
sent
for
me
was
there
anything
suspicious
at
that
time
no
sir
i
went
through
each
room
myself
and
fixed
the
doors
why
the
fire
was
confined
to
the
negatives
have
you
any
idea
why
the
doors
were
open
when
we
went
through
no
sir
i
left
them
shut
and
the
boy
i
put
there
while
i
went
over
to
mccann
said
no
one
was
near
he
wagnalls
hesitated
once
he
went
to
sleep
when
i
left
him
there
perhaps
he
dozed
off
again
why
did
you
leave
why
go
over
to
mccann
in
business
hours
we
worked
until
after
midnight
the
night
before
i
had
to
open
up
early
and
so
i
figured
i
have
my
breakfast
in
the
usual
morning
slack
time
when
nothing
doing
i
see
kennedy
studied
the
ground
for
several
moments
do
you
suppose
anyone
could
have
left
a
package
in
there
a
bomb
in
other
words
wagnalls
eyes
widened
but
he
shook
his
head
i
notice
it
sir
if
i
do
say
it
i
neat
i
generally
notice
if
a
can
has
been
touched
they
do
often
fool
me
well
has
any
regular
stuff
been
brought
to
you
to
put
away
anything
which
might
have
hidden
an
explosive
again
wagnalls
shook
his
head
i
put
nothing
away
or
give
nothing
out
except
on
written
order
from
manton
anything
coming
in
is
negative
and
it
in
rolls
and
i
rehandle
them
because
they
put
away
in
the
flat
boxes
i
know
in
a
minute
if
a
roll
was
phony
you
sure
nothing
special
holy
jehoshaphat
interrupted
wagnalls
i
forgotten
he
faced
manton
remember
that
can
of
undeveloped
stuff
a
roll
he
turned
to
kennedy
explaining
when
negative
undeveloped
we
keep
it
in
taped
cans
take
off
the
tape
and
you
spoil
it
the
light
you
know
manton
sent
down
this
can
with
a
regular
order
marking
on
it
that
some
one
had
to
come
to
watch
it
being
developed
in
about
a
week
of
course
i
did
open
the
can
or
look
in
it
i
put
it
up
on
top
of
a
rack
when
was
this
about
four
days
ago
the
day
miss
lamar
was
killed
the
expression
on
manton
face
was
ghastly
i
did
send
down
any
can
to
you
wagnalls
he
insisted
it
was
your
writing
sir
kennedy
rose
what
did
you
do
with
orders
like
that
such
as
the
one
you
claim
came
with
the
can
of
undeveloped
negative
put
them
on
the
spindle
on
that
table
in
the
vault
wet
your
handkerchief
and
come
show
me
when
they
returned
kennedy
had
the
spindle
in
his
hand
the
charred
papers
still
in
place
this
was
one
of
the
items
preserved
in
part
by
the
chemical
spray
through
the
ventilating
opening
above
can
you
point
out
which
one
it
is
kennedy
asked
let
see
wagnalls
scratched
his
head
next
to
the
top
he
replied
in
a
moment
miss
lamar
death
upset
everything
only
one
order
came
down
after
that
with
extreme
care
kennedy
took
his
knife
and
lifted
the
ashy
flakes
of
the
top
order
get
me
some
collodion
somebody
he
exclaimed
wagnalls
jumped
up
and
hurried
off
the
fire
chief
leaned
forward
do
you
think
kennedy
that
the
little
can
he
told
you
about
started
the
fire
i
sure
of
it
although
i
never
be
able
to
prove
it
how
did
it
work
well
i
imagine
a
small
roll
of
very
dry
film
was
put
in
to
occupy
a
part
of
the
space
film
is
exceedingly
inflammable
especially
when
old
and
brittle
in
composition
it
is
practically
guncotton
and
so
a
high
explosive
in
this
recent
war
i
remember
the
germans
drained
the
neutral
countries
of
film
subjects
until
we
woke
up
to
what
they
were
doing
while
in
this
country
scrap
film
commanded
an
amazing
price
and
went
directly
into
the
manufacture
of
explosives
then
i
figure
that
a
quantity
of
wet
phosphorus
was
added
to
fill
the
can
and
that
then
the
can
was
taped
the
tape
of
course
is
not
moisture
proof
entirely
with
the
dampness
from
within
it
would
soften
might
possibly
fall
off
in
a
relatively
short
time
the
phosphorus
would
dry
and
burn
immediately
the
film
in
the
can
would
ignite
as
happened
it
blew
up
a
minor
explosion
but
enough
to
scatter
phosphorus
everywhere
that
in
the
air
of
the
vault
there
are
always
fumes
in
spite
of
the
best
ventilation
system
made
caused
the
first
big
blast
and
started
all
the
damage
mackay
had
rejoined
us
in
time
to
hear
the
explanation
ingenious
he
murmured
as
ingenious
as
the
methods
used
to
murder
the
girl
and
her
director
breathless
wagnalls
returned
with
the
collodion
we
watched
curiously
as
kennedy
poured
it
over
the
charred
remains
of
the
second
order
on
the
spindle
it
seemed
almost
inconceivable
that
the
remnants
of
the
charred
paper
would
even
support
the
weight
of
the
liquid
yet
kennedy
used
it
with
care
and
slowly
the
collodion
hardened
before
us
creating
a
tough
transparent
coating
which
held
the
tiny
fibers
of
the
slip
together
at
the
same
time
the
action
of
the
collodion
made
the
letters
on
the
order
faintly
visible
and
readable
a
bank
trick
kennedy
told
us
then
he
held
the
slip
up
to
the
light
and
the
words
were
plain
wagnalls
had
been
correct
the
order
from
manton
was
unmistakable
the
can
was
to
be
kept
in
the
negative
vault
for
a
week
without
being
opened
until
a
certain
party
unnamed
was
to
come
to
watch
the
development
of
the
film
the
promoter
wet
his
lips
uneasily
i
i
never
wrote
that
it
my
writing
all
right
and
my
signature
but
it
a
forgery
xxix
microscopic
evidence
kennedy
made
some
efforts
to
preserve
the
forged
order
which
he
had
restored
with
the
collodion
but
i
could
see
that
he
placed
no
great
importance
upon
its
possession
gradually
the
yard
of
the
studio
had
cleared
of
the
employees
who
had
returned
to
their
various
tasks
under
the
direction
of
one
stout
individual
who
seemed
to
possess
authority
the
fire
apparatus
had
been
replaced
in
a
portable
steel
garage
arranged
for
the
purpose
in
a
farther
corner
and
now
several
men
were
engaged
in
cleaning
up
the
dirt
and
litter
caused
in
the
excitement
except
in
the
basement
there
were
few
signs
of
the
blaze
manton
accompanied
the
fire
chief
to
his
car
then
hurried
up
into
the
building
without
further
notice
of
us
mackay
went
to
machine
to
claim
the
traveling
bag
containing
our
evidence
kennedy
and
i
started
for
the
dressing
rooms
i
want
to
get
blood
smears
of
shirley
and
marilyn
he
confided
in
a
low
voice
i
shall
have
to
think
of
some
pretext
neither
of
the
two
we
sought
were
in
their
quarters
and
so
we
continued
on
into
the
studio
here
we
found
kauf
at
work
at
least
he
was
engaged
in
a
desperate
attempt
to
get
something
out
of
his
people
ye
gods
gordon
we
heard
him
exclaim
as
we
made
our
way
through
the
debris
of
the
banquet
set
to
the
ballroom
now
dazzlingly
bright
under
the
lights
what
if
you
do
have
to
wear
a
bandage
around
your
head
it
a
masked
ball
is
it
you
got
a
monk
cowl
over
everything
but
your
features
have
you
it
struck
me
that
the
faces
had
never
been
more
ghastly
although
my
reason
convinced
me
it
was
simply
the
usual
effect
of
the
tubes
but
there
was
no
question
but
that
the
explosion
had
given
everyone
a
bad
fright
that
not
an
actress
or
actor
but
would
have
preferred
to
have
been
nearly
anywhere
else
but
under
the
heat
of
the
glass
roof
now
a
constant
reminder
of
the
accident
because
of
the
gaping
hole
directly
above
them
marilyn
was
in
the
center
of
the
revelers
in
the
set
already
in
costume
shirley
i
saw
close
to
the
camera
men
standing
uneasily
on
shaky
legs
shielding
his
eyes
with
one
hand
while
he
clung
to
a
massive
sideboard
for
support
with
the
other
he
had
not
yet
donned
his
carnival
clothes
nor
essayed
to
put
on
a
enid
faye
the
only
one
in
sight
whose
spirits
seemed
to
have
rallied
at
all
was
offering
him
comfort
of
a
sort
you
get
by
all
right
merle
if
you
can
keep
on
your
pins
and
i
say
you
deserve
credit
for
trying
it
there
she
stepped
back
a
bit
to
study
him
there
just
one
thing
your
eyes
show
the
result
of
all
that
smoke
and
vapor
no
color
or
luster
at
all
i
i
wonder
if
belladonna
would
brighten
them
up
a
bit
and
well
get
you
by
for
i
go
out
and
get
some
at
lunch
he
smiled
weakly
i
try
anything
once
that
the
spirit
she
patted
him
on
the
shoulder
then
danced
on
into
the
center
of
the
set
stopping
to
direct
some
barbed
remark
at
marilyn
kauf
took
his
megaphone
to
call
his
people
around
him
there
seemed
to
be
a
certain
essential
competence
about
the
little
man
now
that
manton
and
phelps
and
millard
were
not
about
to
bother
him
while
we
watched
he
succeeded
in
photographing
one
of
the
full
shots
of
the
general
action
or
atmosphere
of
the
dance
then
he
hurried
to
the
side
of
shirley
to
see
if
the
heavy
man
felt
equal
to
the
task
of
resuming
his
once
more
i
found
the
time
dragging
heavy
on
my
hands
and
i
wished
that
kennedy
would
return
to
the
laboratory
or
decide
upon
some
definite
action
though
i
racked
my
brain
i
failed
to
think
of
a
device
whereby
kennedy
could
get
blood
smears
of
shirley
or
marilyn
without
their
knowledge
once
more
my
reflections
veered
around
to
the
matter
of
the
stolen
towel
and
i
wondered
if
that
had
been
wasted
effort
on
kennedy
part
if
the
fire
had
thrown
out
his
carefully
arranged
plans
to
trap
whoever
took
it
suddenly
i
realized
that
kennedy
was
following
a
very
definite
procedure
that
his
seeming
indifference
his
apparent
idle
curiosity
concerning
the
scene
taking
masked
a
settled
purpose
when
phelps
entered
he
approached
him
casually
and
turned
to
him
with
skilled
nonchalance
holding
up
a
finger
will
you
lend
me
a
pocket
knife
for
a
moment
he
asked
to
get
a
phelps
produced
one
rather
grudgingly
kennedy
promptly
went
over
to
the
window
as
though
seeking
better
light
thereafter
he
avoided
phelps
soon
the
banker
had
forgotten
the
incident
some
time
later
manton
rushed
in
from
the
office
kennedy
maneuvered
his
way
to
the
promoter
side
and
waited
his
chance
to
borrow
that
man
pocket
knife
under
conditions
when
manton
would
be
the
least
apt
to
remember
it
then
he
made
his
way
around
to
mackay
and
i
saw
that
both
the
acquisitions
went
into
little
envelopes
of
the
sort
used
to
take
the
blood
smears
after
the
explosion
and
falling
glass
kennedy
now
seemed
rather
elated
millard
entered
and
he
borrowed
the
scenario
writer
knife
in
exactly
the
same
fashion
as
the
others
no
one
of
the
three
men
noticed
his
loss
i
thought
it
lucky
that
all
three
carried
the
article
and
tried
to
guess
how
far
kennedy
intended
to
carry
this
little
scheme
kauf
announcement
of
lunch
gave
me
my
answer
it
seemed
that
there
would
be
just
half
an
hour
and
that
the
entire
cast
was
expected
to
make
shift
at
mccann
rather
than
attempt
to
go
to
any
better
place
at
a
greater
distance
immediately
kennedy
turned
to
me
hurry
walter
twenty
minutes
quick
work
and
then
it
the
laboratory
and
the
solution
of
this
mystery
with
mackay
and
the
bag
we
stole
to
the
dressing
rooms
waiting
until
sure
that
everyone
was
downstairs
in
enid
chamber
kennedy
glanced
about
carefully
but
swiftly
when
nothing
caught
his
attention
he
picked
up
her
file
gingerly
from
the
blunt
end
slipping
it
into
one
of
the
little
envelopes
which
mackay
held
open
thereupon
the
district
attorney
put
his
identifying
mark
upon
the
outside
and
we
went
to
the
next
room
it
proved
to
be
gordon
the
general
search
was
barren
of
result
but
the
dressing
table
yielded
another
file
handled
in
the
same
manner
as
before
then
we
entered
marilyn
room
and
left
with
the
file
from
her
dressing
stand
in
shirley
quarters
the
last
we
visited
we
were
in
greater
luck
however
while
kennedy
and
mackay
abstracted
the
usual
file
i
discovered
some
bits
of
tissue
paper
used
in
shaving
there
was
caked
soap
left
to
dry
just
as
it
had
been
wiped
from
the
razor
more
there
was
a
blood
stain
of
fair
proportions
here
your
smear
kennedy
i
exclaimed
good
fine
he
faced
mackay
now
i
lack
just
one
thing
a
sample
of
the
blood
of
miss
loring
is
that
all
the
district
attorney
brightened
let
me
try
to
get
it
i
i
manage
it
in
some
way
all
right
kennedy
took
the
bag
explain
your
marks
so
i
know
he
stopped
suddenly
no
do
tell
me
anything
i
make
my
chemical
analyses
and
microscopic
examinations
without
knowing
the
identity
in
the
case
either
of
the
blood
samples
or
the
files
if
i
obtain
results
by
both
methods
and
they
agree
i
return
armed
with
evidence
meanwhile
mackay
you
get
a
smear
from
miss
loring
and
follow
us
to
the
laboratory
i
coax
mcgroarty
to
drive
us
down
so
you
have
your
car
and
you
can
bring
us
back
the
district
attorney
nodded
me
for
mccann
he
muttered
where
she
went
to
eat
he
rushed
off
eagerly
kennedy
had
no
difficulty
persuading
mcgroarty
to
put
his
particular
studio
car
at
our
disposal
without
an
order
from
manton
or
from
the
director
who
had
called
him
in
a
very
brief
space
of
time
we
were
at
the
laboratory
you
expect
to
find
the
blood
of
one
of
those
people
showing
traces
of
the
antivenin
i
grasped
kennedy
method
of
procedure
but
wanted
to
make
sure
i
understood
it
correctly
already
i
was
blocking
out
the
detailed
article
for
the
star
the
big
scoop
which
that
paper
should
have
as
a
result
of
my
close
association
with
kennedy
on
the
case
one
of
those
samples
should
correspond
i
suppose
to
the
trace
of
blood
on
the
portieres
exactly
he
answered
me
rather
absently
being
concerned
in
setting
out
the
apparatus
he
would
need
for
a
hasty
series
of
tests
will
the
antivenin
show
in
the
blood
after
four
perhaps
five
days
i
should
say
so
walter
if
it
does
not
by
any
chance
i
will
be
able
to
identify
the
blood
but
that
is
much
more
involved
and
tedious
a
great
deal
more
actual
work
i
got
it
straight
then
now
i
paced
up
and
down
several
times
the
files
should
show
a
trace
of
the
itching
salve
is
that
correct
craig
for
a
moment
he
did
answer
as
his
mind
was
upon
his
paraphernalia
then
he
straightened
hardly
walter
the
salve
is
soluble
in
water
what
i
shall
find
if
anything
is
some
of
the
fibers
of
the
towel
you
see
a
person
finger
nails
are
great
little
collectors
of
bits
of
foreign
matter
and
anyone
handling
that
rag
is
sure
to
show
some
infinitesimal
trace
for
a
long
while
afterward
if
the
person
stealing
the
towel
filed
or
cleaned
his
nails
there
will
be
evidence
of
the
fibers
on
his
pocket
knife
or
file
i
impregnated
the
towel
with
that
chemical
so
that
i
would
be
able
to
identify
the
fibers
positively
the
use
of
the
itching
salve
was
unnecessary
a
quizzical
smile
crept
across
kennedy
face
did
you
think
i
expected
some
one
to
go
walking
around
the
studio
scratching
his
hands
did
you
imagine
i
thought
the
guilty
party
would
betray
his
or
her
identity
in
such
childish
fashion
after
all
the
cleverness
displayed
in
the
crimes
themselves
but
you
were
insistent
that
i
rub
in
the
to
force
them
to
wash
their
hands
after
touching
the
towel
walter
oh
i
felt
rather
chagrined
would
some
pigment
some
color
have
served
the
purpose
better
no
because
anyone
would
have
understood
that
and
would
have
taken
the
proper
measures
to
remove
all
traces
but
the
itching
salve
served
two
purposes
it
was
misleading
because
obviously
a
trap
upon
reflection
and
so
it
would
distract
attention
from
the
impregnated
fibers
my
real
scheme
then
it
was
the
best
device
of
all
i
could
think
of
for
it
set
up
a
local
irritation
of
the
sort
most
calculated
to
make
a
person
clean
his
finger
nails
the
average
man
and
woman
is
not
very
neat
walter
i
was
not
sure
but
a
scientific
prodding
was
necessary
to
transfer
my
evidence
to
some
object
i
could
borrow
and
examine
under
a
microscope
meanwhile
kennedy
long
fingers
were
busy
at
the
preliminary
operations
in
his
tests
he
turned
away
and
i
asked
no
more
questions
not
wishing
to
delay
him
i
noticed
that
first
he
examined
the
blood
samples
under
the
microscope
afterward
he
employed
a
spectroscope
but
none
of
the
operations
took
any
great
amount
of
time
since
he
seemed
to
anticipate
his
results
mackay
burst
in
upon
us
very
elated
and
produced
a
handkerchief
with
a
bit
of
blood
upon
it
i
scratched
her
deliberately
with
the
sharp
point
of
my
ring
he
chuckled
i
found
her
in
the
restaurant
and
the
seat
beside
her
was
empty
i
i
talked
about
everything
under
the
sun
and
i
guess
she
thinks
i
a
clumsy
boob
anyhow
she
cried
out
when
i
did
it
and
got
red
in
the
face
for
a
moment
but
she
suspects
nothing
kennedy
cut
the
spot
from
the
handkerchief
put
it
in
an
envelope
and
turned
back
to
his
table
i
drew
mackay
into
the
corner
as
the
minutes
sped
by
and
craig
worked
in
absorbed
concentration
mackay
grew
more
and
more
impatient
to
get
back
to
the
studio
did
you
find
anything
repeated
mackay
for
the
tenth
time
with
a
gesture
of
annoyance
kennedy
reached
out
for
the
nail
files
this
is
a
grave
matter
he
frowned
i
must
check
it
up
and
double
check
it
then
i
going
back
to
the
studio
to
triple
check
it
let
me
see
what
the
nail
files
reveal
it
will
be
a
bare
ten
minutes
more
insisting
that
we
remain
back
in
the
corner
he
spread
out
the
four
nail
files
and
the
open
blades
of
the
three
pocket
knives
setting
each
upon
the
envelope
which
identified
it
the
next
quarter
of
an
hour
seemed
interminable
finally
kennedy
started
replacing
the
files
and
the
pocket
knives
in
their
envelopes
his
face
still
wearing
the
inscrutable
frown
next
he
packed
the
blood
samples
and
other
evidence
in
the
traveling
bag
once
more
mackay
was
bursting
with
impatience
but
craig
still
refused
to
betray
his
suspicions
i
must
get
back
there
quick
he
hastened
i
want
everybody
in
the
projection
room
in
court
a
jury
might
not
grasp
the
infallibility
of
the
methods
i
used
there
would
be
a
great
deal
of
medical
and
expert
testimony
required
and
you
know
mackay
what
that
means
is
it
a
man
or
a
woman
you
suspect
persisted
the
district
attorney
three
of
the
men
had
pocket
knives
and
kennedy
led
the
way
to
the
door
without
answering
and
mackay
cut
short
his
hopeless
quizzing
as
craig
nodded
to
me
to
carry
the
bag
xxx
the
ballroom
scene
sounds
of
music
caught
our
ears
as
we
entered
the
studio
courtyard
of
manton
pictures
carrying
the
bag
with
its
indisputable
proof
of
some
person
guilt
we
made
our
way
through
the
familiar
corridor
by
the
dressing
rooms
out
under
the
roof
of
the
large
studio
there
a
scene
of
gayety
confronted
us
in
sharp
contrast
with
the
gloomy
atmosphere
of
the
rest
of
the
establishment
kauf
however
had
thoroughly
demonstrated
his
genius
as
a
director
to
counteract
the
depression
caused
by
all
the
recent
melodramatic
and
tragic
happenings
he
had
brought
in
an
orchestra
establishing
the
men
in
the
set
itself
so
as
to
get
full
photographic
value
from
their
jazz
antics
where
werner
and
manton
had
dispensed
with
music
in
a
desperate
effort
at
economy
kauf
had
realized
that
money
saved
in
that
way
was
lost
through
time
wasted
with
dispirited
people
it
was
a
lesson
learned
long
before
by
other
companies
in
other
studios
i
had
seen
music
employed
in
the
making
of
soberly
dramatic
scenes
solely
as
an
aid
to
the
actors
enabling
them
to
get
into
the
atmosphere
of
their
work
more
quickly
and
naturally
under
the
lights
the
entire
set
sparkled
with
a
tawdry
garishness
apt
to
fool
those
uninitiated
into
the
secrets
of
photography
on
the
screen
colors
which
now
seemed
dull
and
flat
would
take
on
a
soft
richness
and
a
delicacy
characteristic
of
the
society
in
which
characters
were
supposed
to
move
obviously
fragile
scenery
would
seem
as
heavy
and
substantial
as
the
walls
and
beams
of
the
finest
old
mansion
even
the
inferior
materials
in
the
gowns
of
most
of
the
girls
would
photograph
as
well
as
the
most
expensive
silk
in
fact
by
long
experience
many
of
the
extra
girls
had
learned
to
counterfeit
the
latest
fashions
at
a
cost
ridiculous
by
comparison
kennedy
approached
kauf
then
returned
to
us
he
asks
us
to
wait
until
he
gets
this
one
big
scene
it
the
climax
of
the
picture
really
the
unmasking
of
the
terror
if
we
interrupt
now
he
loses
the
result
of
half
a
day
of
preparation
he
may
lose
more
than
that
muttered
mackay
and
i
wondered
just
whom
the
district
attorney
suspected
is
everyone
here
i
asked
all
seven
gordon
and
shirley
of
the
men
and
marilyn
and
enid
of
course
were
out
on
the
floor
of
the
supposed
ballroom
gordon
i
recognized
because
i
remembered
that
he
was
to
wear
the
garb
of
a
monk
marilyn
was
easily
picked
out
although
the
vivacity
she
assumed
seemed
unnatural
now
that
we
knew
her
as
well
as
we
did
her
costume
was
a
glorious
yama
yama
creation
of
a
faint
yellow
which
would
photograph
dazzling
white
revealing
trim
stockinged
ankles
and
slender
bare
arms
framing
face
and
eyes
dancing
with
merriment
and
maliciousness
unquestionably
she
was
the
prettiest
girl
beneath
the
arcs
never
to
be
suspected
as
the
woman
who
had
braved
the
terrors
of
a
film
fire
to
rescue
the
man
she
loved
enid
was
stately
and
serene
in
the
gown
of
marie
antoinette
in
the
bright
glare
her
features
took
on
a
round
innocence
and
she
was
as
successful
in
portraying
sweetness
as
marilyn
was
in
the
simulation
of
the
mocking
evil
of
the
vampire
shirley
interested
me
the
most
however
i
wondered
if
kennedy
still
eliminated
him
in
guessing
at
the
identity
of
the
criminal
i
called
to
mind
the
heavy
man
presence
in
the
basement
at
the
time
of
the
explosion
and
mcgroarty
information
that
he
had
been
hanging
about
that
part
of
the
studio
for
some
time
previously
some
one
had
planted
a
cigarette
case
and
stub
to
implicate
gordon
according
to
theory
shirley
certainly
had
had
opportunity
to
steal
the
towel
from
the
locker
as
well
as
to
point
suspicion
toward
the
leading
man
in
the
midst
of
my
reverie
shirley
approached
and
passed
us
he
was
in
the
garb
of
mephisto
like
the
others
he
had
not
yet
masked
his
face
a
peculiar
brightness
in
his
eyes
struck
me
and
i
nudged
kennedy
belladonna
kennedy
explained
when
he
was
beyond
earshot
oh
i
remembered
enid
told
him
to
use
it
what
i
repeated
the
conversation
as
near
as
i
could
reconstruct
it
that
a
new
cure
for
eyes
no
cure
at
all
i
was
unable
to
get
any
more
out
of
kennedy
however
manton
i
detected
in
the
background
with
phelps
the
two
men
were
arguing
as
always
and
it
was
evident
that
the
banker
was
accomplishing
nothing
by
this
constant
hanging
about
the
studio
where
previously
my
sympathy
had
been
with
phelps
entirely
now
i
realized
that
the
promoter
had
won
me
indeed
manton
interest
in
all
the
affairs
of
picture
making
at
this
plant
had
been
far
too
sincere
and
earnest
to
permit
the
belief
that
he
was
seeking
to
wreck
the
company
or
to
his
backer
millard
entered
the
studio
as
i
glanced
about
for
him
he
handed
some
sheets
to
kauf
then
turned
to
leave
i
attracted
kennedy
attention
you
do
want
millard
to
get
away
i
whispered
kennedy
sent
mackay
to
stop
him
the
author
accompanied
the
district
attorney
willingly
yes
mr
kennedy
as
soon
as
this
scene
is
over
we
going
down
to
the
projection
room
everyone
concerned
in
the
death
of
miss
lamar
and
of
mr
werner
the
scenario
writer
looked
up
quickly
do
you
do
you
know
who
it
is
he
asked
soberly
not
exactly
but
i
will
identify
the
guilty
person
just
as
soon
as
we
are
assembled
down
in
front
of
the
screen
shirley
had
left
the
studio
floor
apparently
to
go
to
his
dressing
room
now
i
noticed
that
he
returned
and
passed
close
just
in
time
to
hear
millard
question
and
kennedy
answer
his
eyes
dilated
as
he
turned
away
his
face
fell
he
went
on
into
the
set
but
his
legs
seemed
to
wabble
beneath
him
i
was
sure
it
was
more
than
the
weakness
resulting
from
his
experience
in
the
fire
kauf
voice
through
the
megaphone
echoed
suddenly
from
wall
to
wall
reverberating
beneath
the
roof
all
ready
everyone
in
the
set
masks
on
take
your
places
at
a
signal
the
orchestra
struck
up
and
the
couples
started
to
dance
it
was
a
wonderfully
colorful
scene
and
i
saw
that
kauf
proposed
to
rehearse
it
thoroughly
doing
it
over
and
over
without
the
cameras
until
every
detail
reached
a
practiced
perfection
in
this
i
was
certain
he
achieved
results
superior
to
werner
slap
dash
and
bang
then
came
the
call
for
action
camera
kauf
began
to
bob
up
and
down
into
it
everybody
for
fascination
and
charm
this
far
exceeded
the
banquet
scene
which
we
had
witnessed
in
the
taking
previously
the
music
was
surprisingly
good
so
that
it
was
impossible
for
the
people
not
to
get
into
the
swing
and
the
result
was
a
riotous
swirling
of
gracefully
dancing
pairs
the
girls
selected
for
their
beauty
flashing
faces
toward
the
camera
displaying
eyes
which
twinkled
through
their
masks
in
mockery
at
a
wholly
ineffectual
attempt
at
concealment
enid
maintained
her
stately
carriage
but
made
full
use
of
the
dazzling
whiteness
of
her
teeth
early
she
permitted
the
attentions
of
the
cowled
monk
whom
she
knew
to
be
her
lover
marilyn
was
everywhere
making
mischief
the
best
she
could
shirley
stalked
about
in
his
satanic
red
which
would
photograph
black
and
appear
even
more
somber
on
the
screen
of
course
the
whole
was
not
photographed
in
a
continuous
strip
from
one
camera
position
i
saw
that
kauf
made
several
long
shots
to
catch
the
general
atmosphere
then
he
made
scenes
of
all
the
principals
and
of
some
of
the
best
appearing
extras
at
one
time
he
ordered
a
panorama
effect
in
which
the
cameras
panned
swept
from
one
side
to
the
other
giving
a
succession
of
faces
at
close
range
finally
everything
was
ready
for
the
climax
shirley
had
been
playing
a
sort
of
jekyll
and
hyde
role
in
which
he
was
at
once
the
young
lawyer
friend
of
enid
and
the
black
terror
unmasked
and
cornered
at
this
function
of
a
society
terrified
by
the
dread
unknown
menace
he
was
to
make
the
transformation
directly
before
the
eyes
of
everyone
using
the
mythical
drug
which
changed
him
from
a
young
man
of
good
appearance
and
family
to
the
being
who
was
a
very
incarnation
of
evil
for
once
kauf
did
not
rehearse
the
scene
shirley
was
obviously
weakened
from
his
experience
and
the
director
wished
to
spare
him
all
the
details
were
shouted
out
through
the
megaphone
however
and
i
grasped
that
the
action
of
this
part
of
the
dance
was
familiar
to
everyone
it
was
the
big
scene
of
the
story
toward
which
all
other
events
had
built
then
came
the
familiar
order
camera
at
the
start
of
this
episode
the
orchestra
was
playing
and
the
dancers
were
in
motion
suddenly
gordon
as
the
hero
strode
up
to
shirley
and
unmasked
him
with
a
few
bitter
words
which
later
would
be
flashed
upon
the
screen
in
a
spoken
title
instantly
a
crowd
gathered
about
but
in
such
a
way
as
not
to
obstruct
the
camera
view
cornered
seeing
that
flight
was
impossible
unless
he
became
the
black
terror
and
possessed
the
strength
and
fearlessness
of
that
strange
other
self
shirley
drew
a
little
vial
from
his
breast
pocket
and
drank
the
contents
evidently
he
knew
his
mansfield
well
slowly
he
began
to
act
out
the
change
in
his
appearance
which
corresponded
with
the
assumption
of
control
by
the
evil
within
his
body
writhed
went
through
contortions
which
were
horrible
yet
fascinating
it
was
almost
as
though
a
new
fearful
being
was
created
within
sight
of
the
onlookers
not
only
was
the
face
altered
but
the
man
stature
seemed
to
shrink
to
lose
actual
inches
i
thought
it
a
wonderful
exhibition
the
very
next
instant
there
came
a
groan
from
shirley
something
which
at
once
indicated
pain
and
realization
and
fear
he
lost
all
control
of
himself
and
in
a
moment
pitched
forward
upon
the
floor
sputtering
and
clutching
at
the
empty
air
another
cry
broke
from
between
his
lips
a
ghastly
contracted
shriek
as
treble
as
though
from
the
throat
of
a
woman
this
was
no
part
of
the
story
no
skillful
bit
of
acting
it
was
real
even
before
i
had
grasped
the
full
significance
of
the
happening
kennedy
had
dashed
forward
the
cameras
still
were
grinding
and
they
caught
him
as
he
kneeled
at
the
side
of
the
stricken
man
hardly
a
second
afterward
mackay
and
i
followed
and
were
at
kennedy
side
kauf
and
the
others
their
faces
weirdly
ashen
clustered
about
in
fright
a
third
time
the
invisible
hand
had
struck
at
a
member
of
the
company
the
black
terror
with
all
the
horror
written
into
that
story
contained
nothing
as
fearful
as
the
menace
to
the
people
engaged
in
its
production
shirley
skin
was
cold
and
clammy
his
face
almost
rigid
while
conscious
he
was
helpless
kennedy
found
the
little
vial
and
examined
it
atropin
he
ejaculated
walter
he
turned
to
me
get
some
physostigmin
quick
have
mackay
drive
you
it
it
life
or
death
here
i
write
it
down
physostigmin
as
i
raced
madly
out
and
down
the
stairs
mackay
at
my
heels
i
heard
a
woman
scream
marilyn
did
she
think
him
dead
once
in
the
car
headed
for
the
nearest
drug
store
grasping
wildly
at
the
side
or
at
the
back
of
the
seat
every
few
moments
as
the
district
attorney
skidded
around
curves
and
literally
hurdled
obstacles
i
remembered
a
forgotten
fact
atropin
that
was
belladonna
simply
another
name
for
the
drug
shirley
had
procured
the
stuff
for
use
in
his
eyes
nevertheless
he
had
been
aware
undoubtedly
of
its
deadly
nature
passing
by
kennedy
and
the
rest
of
us
he
had
overheard
kennedy
state
that
the
murderer
would
be
identified
as
soon
as
all
could
be
assembled
in
the
projection
room
the
heavy
man
had
not
cared
to
face
justice
in
so
prosaic
a
manner
with
the
same
sense
of
the
melodramatic
which
had
led
him
to
slay
stella
lamar
in
the
taking
of
a
scene
werner
in
the
photographing
of
another
he
had
preferred
suicide
and
had
selected
the
most
spectacular
moment
possible
for
his
last
upon
earth
yes
shirley
was
guilty
rather
than
wait
the
slow
processes
of
legal
justice
he
had
attempted
suicide
now
we
raced
to
save
his
life
to
preserve
it
for
a
more
fitting
end
in
the
electric
chair
xxxi
physostigmin
the
first
drug
store
we
found
was
unable
to
supply
us
at
a
second
we
had
better
luck
all
in
all
we
were
back
at
the
manton
pictures
plant
in
a
relatively
few
minutes
a
remarkable
bit
of
driving
on
the
part
of
the
district
attorney
shirley
was
still
in
the
set
kennedy
at
once
administered
the
physostigmin
i
thought
with
an
air
of
great
relief
this
is
one
of
the
rare
cases
in
which
two
drugs
both
highly
poisonous
are
definitely
antagonistic
he
explained
each
therefore
is
an
antidote
for
the
other
when
properly
administered
marilyn
was
chafing
shirley
cold
hands
tears
resting
shamelessly
upon
her
lids
a
look
of
deep
inexpressible
fear
in
her
expression
will
will
you
be
able
to
save
him
professor
she
asked
not
once
but
a
dozen
different
times
none
of
the
rest
of
us
spoke
we
waited
anxiously
for
the
first
signs
of
hope
the
first
indication
that
the
heavy
man
life
might
be
preserved
it
was
wholly
a
question
whether
the
physostigmin
had
been
given
to
him
quickly
enough
kennedy
straightened
finally
and
we
knew
that
the
crisis
was
over
marilyn
broke
down
completely
and
had
to
be
supported
to
a
chair
strong
willing
arms
lifted
shirley
to
take
him
to
his
dressing
room
at
that
moment
kennedy
stood
up
raising
his
voice
so
as
to
demand
the
attention
of
everyone
taking
charge
of
matters
through
sheer
force
of
personality
i
have
come
here
this
afternoon
he
began
to
apprehend
the
man
or
woman
responsible
for
the
death
of
miss
lamar
and
werner
for
the
fire
in
the
negative
vault
and
now
for
this
attempt
upon
the
life
of
mr
shirley
not
a
sound
was
evident
as
he
paused
no
movement
save
a
vague
uneasy
shifting
of
position
on
the
part
of
some
of
those
who
had
been
on
the
point
of
leaving
i
have
indisputable
evidence
of
the
guilty
person
identity
but
nevertheless
for
reasons
which
i
will
explain
to
you
i
have
not
yet
completed
my
identification
to
do
so
it
is
necessary
that
certain
photographed
scenes
be
projected
on
the
screen
and
that
certain
other
matters
be
made
perfectly
clear
i
am
very
anxious
you
see
to
eliminate
the
slightest
possibility
of
error
mackay
here
kennedy
smiled
very
slightly
is
the
district
attorney
with
jurisdiction
at
tarrytown
at
my
request
since
yesterday
or
to
be
exact
since
the
death
of
werner
warned
us
that
no
time
could
be
lost
he
has
carried
a
doe
warrant
immediately
following
my
identification
of
the
guilty
person
he
or
she
will
be
placed
under
arrest
the
charge
will
be
the
murder
of
stella
lamar
by
the
use
of
poison
in
a
manner
which
i
will
explain
to
you
the
trial
will
take
place
at
white
plains
the
county
seat
of
westchester
county
where
the
murder
occurred
mackay
informs
me
that
the
courts
there
are
not
crowded
in
fact
he
personally
has
been
able
to
devote
most
of
his
time
to
this
case
therefore
the
trial
will
be
speedy
and
i
am
sure
that
the
methods
used
by
this
criminal
will
guarantee
a
quick
sentence
and
an
early
trip
to
the
electric
chair
at
ossining
now
suddenly
grim
if
everyone
will
go
down
to
the
projection
room
the
larger
one
we
will
bring
matters
to
their
proper
conclusion
i
imagined
that
kennedy
speech
was
calculated
to
spread
a
little
wholesome
fear
among
the
people
we
had
considered
suspects
in
any
case
that
was
the
result
for
an
outsider
from
the
expressions
upon
the
various
faces
might
have
concluded
that
several
of
them
were
guilty
each
seemed
to
start
off
across
the
studio
floor
reluctantly
as
though
afraid
to
obey
kennedy
yet
unable
to
resist
the
fascination
of
witnessing
the
identification
of
the
criminal
as
though
feeling
that
he
or
she
individually
might
be
accused
and
yet
unwilling
to
seek
safety
at
the
expense
of
missing
kennedy
revelation
of
his
methods
and
explanation
of
their
result
i
drew
him
aside
as
quickly
as
i
could
craig
i
started
eagerly
is
this
all
unnecessary
ca
you
see
that
shirley
is
the
guilty
man
if
you
will
hurry
into
his
room
with
paper
and
pencil
and
get
his
confession
before
he
recovers
from
his
fright
and
regains
his
assurance
what
on
earth
walter
kennedy
interrupted
me
with
a
look
of
surprise
which
i
did
not
miss
even
in
my
excitement
what
are
you
driving
at
anyway
why
shirley
is
the
criminal
he
nonsense
was
an
attempt
made
to
kill
him
just
now
was
it
evident
that
he
was
considered
as
dangerous
to
the
unknown
as
werner
the
director
has
he
been
eliminated
from
our
calculations
as
surely
as
the
man
slain
yesterday
no
i
flushed
not
at
all
craig
this
was
not
an
attempt
at
murder
there
were
none
of
the
criminal
earmarks
noticeable
at
tarrytown
or
in
the
banquet
scene
how
do
you
mean
walter
for
once
kennedy
regarded
me
seriously
why
you
pointed
out
yourself
that
this
unknown
was
exceptionally
clever
the
attempt
on
shirley
if
it
were
an
attempt
was
not
clever
at
all
why
why
i
was
a
little
sarcastic
because
i
was
sure
of
myself
because
the
poison
was
atropin
belladonna
that
is
common
i
read
of
any
number
of
crimes
where
that
was
used
do
you
think
for
a
moment
that
the
mind
which
figured
out
how
to
use
snake
venom
and
botulin
toxin
would
descend
to
anything
as
ordinary
as
all
this
well
if
it
was
not
an
attempt
at
murder
what
was
it
suicide
it
as
plain
as
the
nose
on
your
face
shirley
was
passing
us
as
we
were
standing
with
millard
and
as
you
told
millard
we
all
were
to
go
to
the
projection
room
to
identify
the
criminal
therefore
shirley
knew
he
was
at
the
end
of
his
rope
with
the
theatrical
temperament
he
took
the
poison
just
as
he
finished
playing
his
last
great
scene
it
it
was
a
sort
of
swan
song
quite
a
theory
walter
now
i
knew
kennedy
was
unimpressed
but
where
did
he
get
the
belladonna
for
his
eyes
after
the
smoke
smart
the
drug
is
of
no
use
against
such
inflammation
no
but
it
served
to
brighten
his
eyes
enid
suggested
it
to
him
and
he
went
out
and
got
it
it
helped
him
play
his
scenes
it
gave
him
the
glittering
expression
he
needed
in
his
characterization
again
kennedy
seemed
to
grasp
my
view
he
hesitated
for
several
moments
finally
he
looked
up
if
shirley
is
the
criminal
and
if
he
is
above
using
as
common
a
drug
as
atropin
for
killing
another
man
then
then
why
is
he
above
using
it
upon
himself
that
struck
me
as
easy
to
answer
because
if
he
is
killing
himself
it
is
not
necessary
for
him
to
cover
his
tracks
or
to
do
it
cleverly
and
besides
it
was
my
big
point
he
probably
did
decide
to
try
to
do
it
until
he
overheard
us
and
realized
the
menace
at
that
time
he
had
the
belladonna
in
his
pocket
he
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
procure
anything
else
kennedy
grinned
you
all
wrong
walter
and
i
show
you
where
your
reasoning
is
faulty
in
the
first
place
if
this
criminal
was
the
type
to
commit
suicide
at
the
moment
he
thought
he
was
about
to
be
caught
he
would
be
the
type
who
would
reflect
upon
that
idea
beforehand
as
his
crimes
show
a
great
deal
of
previous
preparation
so
we
may
assume
that
he
would
prepare
for
suicide
or
rather
for
the
possibility
that
he
might
wish
to
attempt
it
therefore
he
would
have
something
better
for
that
purpose
than
atropin
i
shook
my
head
but
kennedy
continued
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
use
of
that
drug
is
not
less
clever
than
the
use
of
the
venom
or
the
toxin
it
is
more
so
stop
and
think
a
minute
the
snake
venom
was
employed
in
the
case
of
miss
lamar
death
because
it
offered
about
the
least
possible
chance
of
leaving
telltale
clues
behind
the
snake
poison
could
be
inflicted
with
a
tiny
scratch
and
in
such
a
way
that
an
outcry
from
the
girl
would
never
be
noticed
nothing
but
my
pocket
lens
caught
the
scratch
only
the
great
care
i
used
in
my
examination
put
us
on
the
trail
at
all
now
remember
how
werner
met
his
death
the
toxin
gave
every
symptom
of
food
poisoning
except
that
we
discovered
the
broken
stem
of
the
wineglass
we
would
never
have
been
able
to
prove
the
tragedy
anything
but
accident
very
possibly
we
have
shirley
to
thank
for
the
fact
that
our
one
clue
there
was
not
removed
or
destroyed
in
both
cases
the
selection
of
the
poison
was
suited
to
the
conditions
therefore
if
an
attempt
was
made
to
kill
shirley
and
of
the
fact
i
am
sure
we
might
expect
that
the
agent
likewise
would
be
one
least
apt
to
create
suspicion
there
are
no
portieres
no
opportunity
for
the
use
of
another
venom
and
besides
that
has
lost
its
novelty
and
so
its
value
similarly
there
is
no
use
of
food
or
wine
in
the
scene
precluding
something
else
along
the
toxin
order
our
unknown
realizes
that
the
safest
place
to
commit
murder
is
where
there
is
a
crowd
he
has
followed
that
principle
consistently
in
the
case
of
the
heavy
man
who
has
a
bit
of
business
before
the
camera
where
he
drinks
the
contents
of
a
little
bottle
the
very
cleverest
thing
is
to
use
belladonna
because
shirley
has
employed
it
for
his
eyes
and
because
maliciously
almost
it
leads
immediately
to
the
hypothesis
of
suicide
ye
gods
craig
a
sudden
thought
struck
me
and
rather
terrified
me
do
you
suppose
enid
faye
suggested
the
use
of
the
drug
to
shirley
as
part
of
the
scheme
to
kill
him
is
she
i
prefer
kennedy
interrupted
i
prefer
to
suppose
that
the
guilty
person
overheard
her
or
perhaps
saw
him
buy
it
or
learned
in
some
other
way
that
he
was
going
to
use
it
completely
taken
up
with
this
new
line
of
thought
i
failed
to
question
kennedy
further
and
it
was
just
as
well
because
most
of
the
people
were
on
their
way
down
to
the
projection
room
not
only
those
we
wished
present
but
practically
everyone
of
sufficient
importance
about
the
studio
to
feel
that
he
could
intrude
kennedy
turned
to
mackay
who
had
taken
no
part
in
our
discussion
although
an
interested
listener
you
have
the
bag
and
all
the
evidence
yes
mackay
picked
it
up
watkins
the
camera
man
watched
it
for
me
while
jameson
and
i
went
after
that
drug
kennedy
stooped
down
quickly
but
it
was
locked
and
had
not
been
tampered
with
in
the
corridor
by
the
dressing
rooms
we
met
kauf
and
kennedy
stopped
him
how
long
would
it
take
to
make
a
print
from
the
scene
where
shirley
took
the
poison
we
could
have
it
ready
in
half
an
hour
in
a
case
of
grim
necessity
half
an
hour
i
exclaimed
at
that
in
disbelief
you
could
begin
to
dry
the
negative
in
that
time
kauf
he
glanced
at
me
tolerantly
we
make
what
is
called
a
wet
print
that
is
we
print
from
the
negative
while
it
is
still
wet
and
so
we
only
have
the
positive
to
dry
then
we
put
it
on
drums
in
a
forced
draught
of
hot
air
the
result
is
not
very
good
but
it
a
fine
thing
sometimes
to
get
a
picture
of
a
parade
or
some
accident
in
a
theater
right
after
it
happens
will
you
do
it
for
me
kauf
kennedy
broke
in
impatiently
this
is
a
case
of
grim
necessity
he
added
kauf
hurried
off
and
we
made
our
way
across
the
yard
to
the
stairs
leading
down
into
the
basement
and
to
the
projection
room
specified
by
kennedy
here
manton
was
waiting
uneasy
flushed
his
face
gathered
in
a
frown
and
his
hands
clenching
and
unclenching
in
his
nervousness
do
you
do
you
know
who
it
is
he
demanded
not
yet
kennedy
replied
first
i
must
marshal
all
my
evidence
who
who
do
you
want
present
in
the
projection
room
phelps
millard
and
yourself
manton
miss
loring
and
miss
faye
gordon
anyone
else
who
wishes
if
there
is
room
phelps
millard
gordon
and
the
two
girls
are
inside
already
good
we
will
start
at
once
manton
turned
to
lead
the
way
in
at
that
moment
there
was
a
call
from
the
yard
we
stopped
looking
up
it
was
shirley
wait
just
a
minute
he
cried
he
was
so
weak
that
the
two
extra
men
who
were
helping
him
virtually
supported
his
weight
on
his
face
was
a
look
of
desperate
determination
i
i
must
see
this
too
he
gasped
xxxii
camera
evidence
coming
in
from
the
bright
light
of
open
day
the
projection
room
seemed
a
gloomy
forbidding
place
certainly
well
calculated
to
break
down
the
reserve
of
perhaps
the
cleverest
criminal
ever
pitting
his
skill
against
the
science
of
craig
kennedy
it
was
a
small
room
long
and
not
so
wide
with
a
comparatively
low
ceiling
in
order
to
obviate
eye
strain
the
walls
were
painted
somberly
and
there
were
no
light
colors
in
evidence
except
for
a
nearly
square
patch
of
white
at
the
farther
end
the
screen
upon
which
the
pictures
were
projected
the
illumination
was
very
dim
this
was
so
that
there
would
be
no
great
contrast
between
the
light
reflected
from
the
images
cast
upon
the
screen
during
pictures
and
the
illumination
in
the
room
itself
between
reels
again
designed
to
prevent
strain
upon
the
eyes
of
the
employees
whose
work
was
the
constant
examination
of
film
in
various
stages
of
its
assembly
the
chairs
were
fastened
to
the
floor
arranged
in
tiny
crescents
and
placed
so
as
not
to
interfere
with
the
throw
of
the
pictures
from
behind
the
projection
machines
themselves
two
in
number
in
order
to
provide
continuous
projection
by
alternating
the
reels
and
so
threading
one
machine
while
running
the
other
were
in
a
fireproof
booth
or
separate
room
connected
with
the
tiny
auditorium
only
by
slits
in
the
wall
and
a
sort
of
porthole
through
which
the
operator
could
talk
or
take
his
instructions
directly
beneath
the
openings
to
the
booth
were
a
table
equipped
with
a
shaded
lamp
a
stand
for
manuscripts
and
a
signal
button
here
the
film
cutters
and
editors
sat
watching
the
subject
upon
which
they
worked
and
making
notes
for
changes
for
bits
of
superfluous
action
to
be
cut
out
or
for
titles
or
spoken
inserts
to
be
moved
at
a
signal
the
operator
could
be
instructed
to
stop
at
any
point
or
to
start
or
to
wind
back
and
run
some
given
piece
over
again
the
lights
in
the
room
were
controlled
from
within
the
booth
and
also
by
a
switch
just
at
the
side
of
the
door
a
telephone
on
the
table
offered
a
connection
with
any
part
of
the
studio
or
with
the
city
exchanges
so
that
an
official
of
the
company
could
be
reached
while
viewing
a
picture
as
we
entered
i
tried
to
study
the
different
faces
but
found
it
a
hopeless
task
on
account
of
the
poor
light
kennedy
took
his
place
at
the
little
table
switching
on
the
little
shaded
lamp
and
motioning
for
mackay
to
set
the
traveling
bag
so
he
could
open
it
and
view
the
contents
then
mackay
took
post
at
the
door
a
hand
in
his
pocket
and
i
realized
that
the
district
attorney
clasped
a
weapon
beneath
the
cover
of
his
clothing
and
was
prepared
for
trouble
i
moved
over
to
be
ready
to
help
kennedy
if
necessary
as
kennedy
took
his
key
unlocking
the
bag
it
would
have
been
possible
to
have
heard
the
slightest
movement
of
a
hand
or
foot
the
faintest
gasp
of
breath
so
tense
was
the
silence
first
kennedy
took
out
the
various
rolls
of
film
looking
up
he
caught
the
face
of
the
operator
at
the
opening
in
the
wall
and
handed
them
to
him
one
by
one
here
are
two
sections
of
the
opening
of
the
story
scenes
one
to
thirteen
of
black
terror
put
together
in
order
but
without
subtitles
one
is
printed
from
the
negative
of
the
head
camera
man
watkins
the
other
is
exactly
the
same
action
as
taken
by
the
other
photographer
we
will
run
both
but
wait
for
my
signal
between
each
piece
understand
yes
sir
now
i
am
giving
you
two
rolls
which
contain
prints
of
the
negative
from
both
cameras
of
the
action
at
the
moment
of
werner
death
those
are
to
be
projected
in
the
same
way
when
i
give
you
the
signal
following
that
there
will
be
two
very
short
pieces
which
show
the
attempt
upon
the
life
of
shirley
they
are
being
rushed
through
the
laboratory
at
this
moment
and
will
be
brought
to
you
by
the
time
we
are
ready
for
them
finally
kennedy
paused
and
as
he
took
the
rolls
of
negative
of
the
snake
film
i
could
see
that
he
hesitated
to
allow
them
out
of
his
hands
even
for
a
few
moments
here
is
some
negative
which
will
be
my
little
climax
it
it
is
very
valuable
indeed
so
please
be
careful
you
you
want
to
project
the
negative
queried
the
operator
yes
they
tell
me
it
can
be
done
even
with
negative
as
old
and
brittle
as
this
if
you
are
careful
i
be
careful
sir
you
punch
the
button
there
once
to
stop
and
two
to
go
i
be
ready
in
a
moment
as
he
spoke
he
disappeared
and
soon
we
heard
the
unmistakable
hiss
of
the
arcs
in
his
machines
kennedy
stooped
and
from
the
bag
produced
the
little
envelopes
with
the
pocket
knives
and
nail
files
the
set
of
envelopes
with
the
samples
of
blood
the
piece
of
silk
he
had
cut
from
the
portiere
at
tarrytown
the
tiny
bits
he
had
cut
from
the
towel
found
by
me
in
the
washroom
of
this
studio
and
a
microscope
the
last
i
guessed
for
effect
around
in
the
semidarkness
i
could
see
the
faces
as
necks
were
craned
to
watch
us
kennedy
deliberateness
his
air
of
certainty
must
have
struck
terror
home
to
some
one
person
in
the
little
audience
often
kennedy
depended
upon
hidden
scientific
instruments
to
catch
the
faint
outward
signs
of
the
emotions
of
his
people
in
a
seance
of
this
sort
to
allow
the
comparison
of
their
reactions
in
the
course
of
his
review
of
the
evidence
to
give
him
what
amounted
to
a
very
sure
proof
of
the
one
person
guilt
the
very
absence
of
some
such
preparation
indicated
to
me
the
extent
of
his
confidence
at
length
he
began
his
little
lecture
for
all
the
world
as
though
this
were
one
of
his
classes
at
the
university
as
though
there
were
at
stake
some
matter
of
chemical
reaction
i
need
not
tell
you
ladies
and
gentlemen
that
this
is
a
highly
scientific
age
in
which
we
live
his
tones
were
leisurely
businesslike
cool
your
own
profession
the
moving
picture
with
all
its
detail
of
photography
and
electricity
its
blending
of
art
and
drama
and
mechanics
is
indicative
of
that
but
a
pause
for
emphasis
it
is
of
my
own
profession
i
wish
to
talk
just
now
the
detection
and
prevention
of
crime
criminals
as
a
whole
were
probably
the
very
first
class
of
society
to
realize
the
full
benefit
of
modern
science
banks
and
business
institutions
the
various
detective
and
police
forces
all
grades
and
walks
of
life
have
been
put
to
it
to
keep
abreast
of
the
development
of
scientific
crime
so
true
has
this
been
that
it
is
a
matter
of
common
belief
with
many
people
that
the
hand
of
the
law
may
be
defied
with
impunity
that
justice
may
be
cheated
with
absolute
certainty
just
so
long
as
a
guilty
man
or
woman
is
sufficiently
clever
and
sufficiently
careful
fortunately
the
real
truth
is
quite
the
reverse
science
has
extended
itself
in
many
dimensions
of
space
with
the
use
of
a
microscope
for
instance
a
whole
new
world
is
opened
up
to
the
trained
detective
everyone
knows
now
that
the
examination
of
hands
and
fingers
is
an
infallible
aid
in
the
identification
of
criminals
and
in
the
proof
of
the
presence
of
a
suspect
at
the
scene
of
a
crime
i
refer
to
fingerprints
of
course
but
fingerprints
are
only
one
small
detail
in
this
department
of
investigation
our
criminals
know
that
gloves
must
be
worn
or
any
smooth
surface
wiped
so
as
to
remove
the
prints
in
that
way
they
believe
they
cheat
the
microscope
or
the
pocket
lens
as
a
matter
of
fact
few
people
have
thought
of
another
way
of
gaining
evidence
from
the
finger
tips
but
it
is
a
method
possible
to
the
scientist
and
is
not
only
practicable
but
exceedingly
effective
in
time
it
will
be
recognized
by
all
specialists
in
crime
now
i
refer
to
the
deposits
under
the
finger
nail
indeed
it
is
surprising
how
many
things
find
their
way
under
the
nail
and
into
the
corners
of
the
cuticle
kennedy
indicated
the
files
and
pocket
knives
visible
in
the
shaded
square
of
light
before
him
the
value
of
examining
deposits
becomes
evident
when
we
realize
that
everyone
carries
away
in
that
fashion
a
sample
of
every
bit
of
material
he
handles
to
touch
a
piece
of
cloth
even
lightly
will
result
in
the
catching
of
a
few
of
its
fibers
similarly
the
finger
nails
will
deposit
either
a
small
or
large
portion
of
their
accumulation
upon
such
things
as
the
knife
blades
or
files
used
to
clean
them
and
there
identification
still
is
possible
nothing
in
the
world
is
too
infinitesimal
for
use
as
evidence
beneath
the
microscope
in
classifying
these
accumulations
kennedy
paused
and
the
silence
in
the
little
room
was
we
may
say
that
there
are
some
which
are
legitimate
and
some
which
are
not
it
is
the
latter
which
concern
us
now
the
first
day
we
were
here
at
the
studio
just
four
days
ago
now
and
immediately
following
the
murder
of
miss
lamar
jameson
discovered
a
towel
in
the
washroom
on
the
second
floor
of
the
office
building
on
that
towel
there
were
spots
of
chinese
yellow
as
though
it
had
been
used
to
wipe
a
face
or
hands
by
some
actor
or
actress
those
spots
were
unimportant
there
were
others
however
of
an
entirely
different
nature
together
with
the
mark
of
blood
and
a
stain
which
showed
that
a
hypodermic
needle
had
been
cleaned
upon
the
towel
before
it
was
thrown
in
the
basket
kennedy
leaned
forward
his
eyes
traveled
from
face
to
face
that
towel
was
a
dangerous
clue
now
there
was
a
new
grim
element
in
his
voice
that
towel
alone
has
given
me
the
evidence
on
which
i
shall
obtain
a
conviction
in
this
case
i
let
it
be
known
that
it
was
in
my
possession
and
the
guilty
man
or
woman
understood
at
once
the
value
it
would
be
to
me
in
order
to
gain
additional
clues
i
purposely
gave
the
impression
that
i
had
yet
to
analyze
either
the
spots
or
the
trace
of
blood
i
wanted
the
towel
stolen
and
for
that
purpose
i
placed
the
bag
containing
it
in
a
locker
and
left
the
locker
unguarded
i
coated
the
towel
with
a
substance
which
would
cause
discomfort
and
alarm
itching
salve
not
with
the
idea
that
anyone
would
be
foolish
enough
to
go
about
scratching
before
my
eyes
but
with
the
idea
of
making
that
person
believe
that
such
was
my
purpose
and
with
the
idea
of
driving
him
or
her
to
washing
his
hands
at
once
and
more
with
the
idea
of
forcing
him
or
scaring
him
into
cleaning
his
fingernails
i
succeeded
on
one
of
these
files
or
knife
blades
i
have
found
and
identified
the
fibers
of
that
towel
i
do
not
yet
know
the
person
but
i
know
the
mark
placed
by
mackay
on
the
outside
of
the
little
envelope
and
when
i
tell
mackay
the
mark
he
will
name
the
guilty
person
mr
kennedy
manton
spoke
up
impulsively
every
towel
in
the
studio
is
the
same
i
bought
them
all
at
the
same
time
the
fibers
would
all
be
alike
you
have
named
seven
people
to
me
including
myself
as
possibly
guilty
of
these
these
murders
your
conclusions
may
be
very
unjust
and
may
lead
to
a
serious
miscarriage
of
justice
kennedy
was
unperturbed
this
particular
towel
in
addition
to
the
itching
salve
was
thoroughly
impregnated
with
a
colorless
chemical
which
changed
the
composition
of
the
fibers
in
a
way
easily
distinguishing
them
from
the
others
under
the
microscope
do
you
see
mr
manton
the
promoter
had
no
more
to
say
now
what
connection
has
the
towel
with
the
case
simply
this
kennedy
picked
up
one
of
the
tiny
pieces
he
had
cut
out
of
it
the
poison
used
to
kill
miss
lamar
was
snake
venom
he
paused
while
a
little
murmur
went
through
his
audience
the
first
sound
i
had
detected
these
spots
on
the
towel
are
antivenin
the
venom
itself
is
exceedingly
dangerous
to
handle
the
guilty
man
or
woman
took
no
chances
but
inoculated
himself
with
antivenin
protection
against
any
chance
action
of
the
poison
the
marks
on
the
towel
are
the
marks
made
by
the
needle
used
by
that
person
in
taking
the
inoculation
if
you
will
follow
me
closely
you
will
understand
the
significance
of
this
miss
lamar
was
killed
by
the
scratch
of
a
needle
secreted
in
the
portieres
through
which
she
came
playing
the
scene
in
library
that
i
will
prove
to
you
when
i
show
you
the
film
the
night
following
her
death
some
one
broke
into
the
room
there
at
tarrytown
and
removed
the
needle
in
removing
the
needle
that
person
scratched
himself
or
herself
on
the
portieres
i
found
some
tiny
spots
of
blood
kennedy
paused
to
hold
up
the
bit
of
heavy
silk
i
analyzed
them
and
found
that
the
blood
serum
had
changed
in
character
very
subtly
i
demonstrated
that
the
blood
of
the
person
who
took
the
needle
contained
antivenin
and
if
necessary
i
can
prove
the
blood
to
come
from
the
same
individual
who
wiped
the
needle
on
the
towel
in
the
studio
kennedy
pressed
the
button
before
him
twice
now
i
want
you
to
see
actually
see
miss
lamar
meet
her
death
the
lights
went
out
then
the
picture
flashed
on
the
screen
before
us
revealing
the
gloom
and
mystery
of
the
opening
scene
of
the
black
terror
we
saw
the
play
of
the
flashlight
finally
the
fingers
and
next
the
arm
of
stella
as
she
parted
the
curtains
in
the
we
witnessed
the
repetition
of
her
appearance
since
the
film
was
simply
spliced
together
not
matched
or
trimmed
following
came
all
the
action
down
to
the
point
where
she
collapsed
over
the
figure
of
werner
on
the
floor
before
the
camera
man
stopped
manton
rushed
in
and
was
photographed
bending
over
her
kennedy
voice
was
dramatically
tense
for
not
one
of
us
but
had
been
profoundly
affected
by
the
reproduction
of
the
tragedy
did
you
notice
the
terror
in
her
face
when
she
cried
out
was
that
terror
really
if
you
were
watching
you
would
have
detected
a
slight
flinch
as
she
brushed
her
arm
up
against
the
silk
for
just
a
moment
she
was
not
acting
it
was
pain
not
pretended
terror
which
made
her
scream
the
devilish
feature
to
this
whole
plot
was
the
care
taken
to
cover
just
that
inevitable
exclamation
now
watch
closely
as
i
signal
the
operator
to
run
the
same
action
from
the
other
camera
notice
the
gradual
effect
of
the
poison
how
she
forces
herself
to
keep
going
without
realization
of
the
fact
that
death
is
at
hand
how
she
collapses
finally
through
sheer
inability
to
maintain
her
control
of
herself
a
moment
longer
during
the
running
of
the
second
piece
the
tense
silence
in
the
room
was
ghastly
who
was
the
guilty
person
who
possessed
such
amazing
callousness
that
an
exhibition
of
this
sort
brought
no
outcry
now
kennedy
glanced
around
in
the
dim
light
switched
on
between
the
running
of
the
different
strips
i
going
to
project
the
banquet
scenes
and
show
you
the
manner
of
werner
death
scene
after
scene
of
the
banquet
flashed
before
us
here
the
cutter
had
not
been
sure
just
what
kennedy
wanted
and
had
spliced
up
everything
we
saw
the
marvelous
direction
of
werner
who
little
realized
that
it
was
to
be
his
last
few
moments
on
earth
and
we
grasped
the
beauty
and
illusion
of
the
set
caused
by
the
mirrors
and
the
man
skill
in
placing
his
people
yet
there
was
not
a
sound
because
we
knew
that
this
was
a
tragedy
a
grim
episode
in
which
there
was
no
human
justification
whatever
werner
rose
at
his
place
he
proposed
his
toast
he
drank
the
contents
of
his
glass
then
his
expression
changed
to
wonderment
and
from
that
to
fear
and
realization
and
he
dropped
to
the
floor
kennedy
voice
interrupting
seemed
to
me
to
come
from
a
great
distance
so
powerfully
was
i
affected
by
the
bit
of
film
the
poison
used
to
kill
werner
was
botulin
toxin
selected
because
its
effects
could
not
be
diagnosed
as
anything
other
than
ordinary
food
poisoning
when
we
look
at
the
print
from
the
second
camera
negative
you
will
notice
how
quickly
it
acted
it
was
the
pure
toxin
placed
in
his
glass
before
the
wine
was
poured
once
more
the
unfortunate
director
death
was
reproduced
before
us
struck
down
exclaimed
craig
as
though
by
some
invisible
lightning
bolt
without
mercy
without
a
chance
without
the
slightest
bit
of
compunction
why
i
tell
you
because
he
suspected
in
fact
knew
who
the
guilty
person
was
because
he
followed
that
person
out
to
tarrytown
the
night
the
needle
was
removed
from
the
portieres
because
he
was
a
menace
to
that
person
life
kennedy
turned
to
the
operator
have
those
other
scenes
come
down
yes
sir
all
right
kennedy
faced
the
rest
of
us
again
there
was
or
rather
is
another
person
who
suspects
the
identity
of
the
criminal
an
attempt
was
made
upon
the
life
of
shirley
shirley
will
not
tell
whom
he
suspects
because
he
has
no
definite
proof
yet
for
the
mere
fact
that
he
suspects
he
narrowly
escaped
the
fate
of
stella
lamar
and
werner
kennedy
pressed
the
button
witness
the
effort
to
kill
the
man
playing
the
part
of
the
black
terror
the
print
was
terribly
bad
in
appearance
almost
a
dupe
due
to
the
speed
with
which
it
had
been
made
nevertheless
the
two
very
brief
scenes
rushed
through
for
this
showing
were
more
absorbingly
thrilling
more
graphic
than
anything
ever
to
be
seen
even
in
a
news
reel
at
a
movie
theater
notice
kennedy
exclaimed
he
puts
his
hand
in
one
pocket
he
fumbles
hesitates
then
finds
the
bottle
in
the
other
whoever
put
the
poison
in
the
vial
replaced
it
in
the
wrong
pocket
the
film
shows
that
very
clearly
the
camera
proves
that
it
was
not
an
attempt
at
suicide
yet
the
poison
used
was
belladonna
selected
because
this
victim
had
purchased
some
and
because
it
would
seem
sure
therefore
that
he
had
committed
suicide
we
sat
in
silence
listening
horrified
there
is
still
another
matter
kennedy
went
on
after
a
moment
the
fire
in
the
negative
vault
this
morning
was
incendiary
i
have
proved
to
the
satisfaction
of
several
of
us
that
a
bomb
was
constructed
of
wet
phosphorus
and
old
film
and
placed
in
the
vault
by
trickery
four
days
ago
the
same
day
stella
lamar
was
killed
through
a
miscalculation
the
phosphorus
was
slow
in
drying
and
the
fire
did
not
occur
until
thanks
to
that
fact
i
have
in
my
possession
a
bit
of
negative
which
the
murderer
very
likely
wished
to
have
destroyed
in
fact
i
believe
its
destruction
to
be
the
motive
in
planning
the
fire
in
the
vault
he
faced
the
operator
ready
to
run
the
negative
yes
sir
kennedy
pressed
the
button
and
when
the
projection
machine
threw
its
picture
upon
the
screen
i
saw
something
such
as
i
had
never
imagined
before
everything
was
black
which
should
have
been
white
and
everything
white
which
should
have
been
black
the
two
extremes
shaded
into
each
other
in
weird
fashion
in
fact
it
was
uncanny
to
watch
a
negative
projected
and
i
followed
fascinated
this
is
a
film
made
with
the
of
doctor
nagoya
of
the
castleton
institute
and
i
am
told
by
manton
that
it
is
one
of
the
finest
snake
pictures
ever
made
kennedy
spoke
fast
so
that
we
would
get
the
full
benefit
of
his
explanation
and
so
that
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
subject
the
negative
to
the
wear
and
tear
of
the
sprocket
wheels
in
the
projection
machine
again
i
am
running
this
for
you
to
show
you
the
action
of
the
rattlesnake
whose
venom
was
used
to
kill
miss
lamar
and
to
give
you
an
idea
of
the
source
of
the
knowledge
of
snake
poison
at
this
moment
doctor
nagoya
whom
i
could
barely
recognize
in
the
inverted
photography
seized
one
of
the
rattlers
it
was
a
and
we
could
see
the
reptile
dart
out
its
forked
tongue
seeking
to
get
at
the
hands
of
the
japanese
locked
firmly
about
its
neck
then
another
man
walked
into
the
picture
holding
a
jar
at
once
the
snake
struck
at
the
glass
as
it
did
so
it
was
possible
to
see
drops
of
the
venom
projected
into
the
jar
other
details
followed
and
there
were
views
of
other
sorts
and
breeds
of
snakes
from
the
poisonous
to
the
most
harmless
the
principal
scene
however
had
been
the
one
showing
the
venom
lights
up
the
operator
threw
the
switch
again
stopping
the
film
and
at
the
same
time
lighting
the
projection
room
kennedy
stepped
forward
and
turned
to
face
us
there
was
this
negative
in
the
vaults
he
spoke
rapidly
it
bore
a
certain
name
on
the
film
as
editor
some
one
knew
that
proof
of
the
possession
of
this
knowledge
of
snakes
might
prove
a
powerful
link
in
the
chain
against
him
if
that
had
been
a
positive
instead
of
a
negative
you
would
have
recognized
doctor
nagoya
there
was
a
double
motive
in
blowing
that
vault
to
destroy
the
company
and
to
protect
himself
in
fact
all
the
rest
of
the
negative
was
destroyed
only
by
chance
i
saved
this
piece
the
very
one
that
he
wanted
to
destroy
everyone
waited
breathlessly
for
kennedy
next
move
suddenly
kennedy
flushed
i
could
see
that
he
became
genuinely
angry
in
this
room
he
exclaimed
there
sits
the
most
unscrupulous
inhuman
being
i
have
ever
known
yet
he
maintains
silence
believing
still
that
he
can
defy
the
scientific
evidence
of
his
crimes
i
have
not
yet
mentioned
however
the
real
proof
of
his
guilt
kennedy
picked
up
one
of
the
little
envelopes
one
which
contained
a
blood
smear
during
the
explosion
this
morning
a
number
of
you
were
cut
by
falling
glass
you
will
remember
that
i
bound
up
your
cuts
carefully
cleansing
each
one
and
wiping
away
the
blood
that
gave
me
a
sample
of
the
blood
of
everyone
but
miss
loring
and
shirley
subsequently
without
their
knowledge
i
obtained
a
sample
from
each
of
them
thus
i
have
a
specimen
from
everyone
concerned
or
possibly
concerned
in
the
murders
he
glanced
about
but
even
now
there
was
no
telltale
revelation
i
have
analyzed
these
and
one
shows
that
the
person
from
whom
i
obtained
the
sample
has
been
inoculated
with
antivenin
the
mark
on
the
envelope
is
the
same
as
the
mark
on
the
envelope
containing
the
towel
fibers
a
double
proof
furthermore
i
am
prepared
to
show
that
it
is
the
same
blood
as
the
blood
upon
the
portiere
he
faced
me
all
at
once
his
voice
carried
the
sharpness
of
a
whip
walter
relieve
mackay
at
the
door
and
take
his
weapon
let
no
one
out
mackay
come
here
an
instant
later
the
district
attorney
leaned
over
he
glanced
at
the
mark
indicated
by
kennedy
then
whispered
a
name
the
next
instant
kennedy
rose
i
thought
so
he
muttered
raising
his
voice
he
addressed
all
of
us
here
is
a
man
who
thought
crime
so
long
that
he
believed
he
could
get
away
with
murder
not
only
did
he
commit
a
second
murder
and
plan
a
third
to
cover
the
first
but
he
planted
evidence
against
nearly
all
of
you
he
dropped
the
ampulla
in
mcgroarty
car
to
implicate
any
one
of
four
people
he
coolly
stole
a
cigarette
case
to
put
it
where
it
would
be
found
after
the
film
fire
and
clinch
suspicion
for
all
this
what
justification
has
he
had
jealousy
jealousy
of
the
narrowest
most
primitive
sort
actuated
him
not
only
was
he
willing
to
kill
stella
lamar
but
he
sought
to
destroy
every
foot
of
negative
in
which
she
had
appeared
he
was
jealous
of
her
success
greater
than
his
jealous
of
her
interest
in
other
men
greater
than
her
interest
in
him
her
divorce
was
maneuvered
directly
by
him
simply
because
he
thought
it
would
hurt
and
humiliate
her
and
for
no
other
reason
when
nothing
seemed
to
stop
her
on
her
upward
climb
when
he
realized
that
she
was
as
ambitious
as
he
was
and
that
her
position
in
the
picture
world
alone
interested
her
he
sought
by
devious
means
by
subtle
schemes
by
spreading
dissatisfaction
and
encouraging
dissension
to
wreck
the
company
which
had
made
her
at
the
end
he
killed
her
waiting
craftily
until
she
was
at
the
very
climax
of
her
finest
piece
of
work
the
opening
scenes
of
black
terror
there
was
bitterness
in
kennedy
tones
before
i
would
not
believe
that
a
man
suddenly
the
projection
room
was
plunged
into
darkness
some
one
had
pushed
the
wall
switch
close
by
me
i
backed
into
the
doorway
raising
my
weapon
to
resist
any
attempt
to
escape
almost
at
the
same
instant
there
were
the
sounds
of
a
struggle
kennedy
had
dashed
forward
in
the
darkness
sure
of
the
position
of
his
man
unafraid
a
scream
i
recognized
from
the
throat
of
enid
i
groped
for
the
switch
but
the
operator
in
the
booth
anticipated
me
in
the
first
burst
of
illumination
i
saw
that
kennedy
had
forced
his
antagonist
back
over
the
front
row
of
chairs
almost
i
heard
the
crack
of
the
man
spine
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
man
face
and
gasped
at
the
murderous
rage
as
he
struggled
and
strove
to
break
kennedy
iron
grip
enid
was
the
first
at
kennedy
side
with
an
expression
i
failed
to
analyze
until
long
afterward
she
sought
to
claw
at
the
unprotected
features
twitching
now
in
impotent
fury
you
wrote
that
note
for
her
to
meet
you
at
the
tearoom
kennedy
muttered
eyes
narrowing
grimly
knowing
she
would
be
dead
before
that
time
you
protected
yourself
against
the
poisoned
needle
in
the
portieres
but
your
own
blood
convicts
you
millard
the
end
