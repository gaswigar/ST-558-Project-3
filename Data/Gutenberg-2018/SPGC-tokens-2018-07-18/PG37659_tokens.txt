translator
preface
it
is
with
a
feeling
of
diffidence
that
i
offer
to
american
readers
this
the
first
english
version
of
that
unknown
titan
vondel
a
poet
of
whom
southey
words
on
bilderdÿk
another
dutch
bard
might
also
have
been
spoken
the
language
of
a
state
inferior
in
illustrious
deeds
to
none
but
circumscribed
by
narrow
bounds
hath
pent
within
its
sphere
a
name
wherewith
europe
should
else
have
rung
from
side
to
side
this
translation
of
the
lucifer
is
the
result
of
years
of
careful
study
and
i
may
therefore
be
pardoned
for
calling
it
a
conscientious
effort
my
object
has
been
to
give
merely
a
literal
but
sympathetic
rendering
it
has
been
my
aim
to
preserve
the
old
poet
in
all
his
rugged
simplicity
for
every
syllable
of
this
classic
has
been
hallowed
by
centuries
it
is
sacred
and
every
change
is
but
a
desecration
sacred
as
is
the
body
of
such
a
poem
yet
how
much
holier
is
its
spirit
the
elusive
properties
of
its
soul
but
how
seldom
does
the
translation
of
a
great
classic
prove
other
than
the
breaking
of
the
chalice
and
the
spilling
of
the
wine
yet
if
but
some
faint
aroma
of
its
original
beauty
linger
around
the
fragment
of
this
offering
this
version
of
vondel
grand
drama
i
lay
down
my
pen
content
i
am
aware
that
less
accuracy
and
a
greater
freedom
might
in
many
places
have
produced
a
more
ornate
and
highly
finished
rendering
but
this
it
seems
to
me
would
have
weakened
a
poem
a
poem
whose
chief
merit
is
its
remarkable
virility
every
word
in
a
translation
of
a
classic
not
in
the
original
is
but
the
alloy
that
lessens
the
proportion
of
true
gold
in
the
coin
of
its
worth
felicitous
paraphrasing
is
often
only
a
confession
of
inability
to
translate
an
author
into
the
true
terms
of
poetical
equation
mere
prettinesses
are
surely
not
to
be
expected
in
a
poem
so
sublime
and
stately
i
have
therefore
followed
the
text
of
the
original
very
closely
the
body
of
the
drama
was
written
by
vondel
in
rimed
alexandrines
this
part
of
the
play
i
have
rendered
into
blank
verse
a
metrical
form
far
better
suited
to
the
english
drama
and
also
more
adapted
to
the
genius
of
our
language
it
is
obvious
too
that
this
admits
of
much
greater
accuracy
in
the
translation
i
have
however
scrupulously
adhered
to
the
original
metres
of
all
the
choruses
most
of
them
very
involved
and
intricate
some
modelled
after
the
antique
even
to
preserving
the
feminine
and
interior
rimes
for
the
utility
and
beauty
of
the
chorus
is
in
its
music
and
the
music
consists
in
both
metre
and
rime
i
have
also
generally
followed
capitalization
and
punctuation
and
his
spelling
of
the
names
of
the
characters
as
belzebub
rafael
apollion
etc
with
the
much
discussed
question
of
milton
indebtedness
to
vondel
this
effort
has
nothing
to
do
i
mention
this
merely
to
show
that
this
version
was
not
made
that
it
might
be
adduced
as
proof
of
influence
on
his
great
english
contemporary
it
has
a
much
higher
reason
to
commend
it
namely
the
intrinsic
value
of
the
original
as
a
poem
and
as
a
national
masterpiece
my
desire
has
been
to
give
vondel
and
vondel
is
a
sufficient
justification
at
the
same
time
i
was
not
displeased
when
i
received
a
letter
from
a
distinguished
american
scholar
stating
that
this
translation
also
incidentally
fills
a
wide
gap
in
the
miltonic
criticism
and
that
it
thus
supplies
a
great
desideratum
with
this
version
of
vondel
masterpiece
i
have
also
been
asked
to
give
a
sketch
of
the
poet
and
his
time
and
an
interpretation
of
the
drama
since
there
is
so
little
in
english
on
the
subject
in
writing
the
former
i
found
much
of
value
in
gosse
charming
essays
on
vondel
in
his
northern
studies
i
must
also
acknowledge
my
great
obligations
to
kalff
life
of
vondel
before
closing
i
wish
to
thank
the
poets
and
scholars
of
the
netherlands
for
their
encouragement
their
kind
reception
of
my
effort
was
a
gratifying
surprise
to
me
i
must
also
take
this
opportunity
to
record
the
kindness
of
that
eminent
scholar
kalff
professor
of
dutch
literature
in
the
university
of
utrecht
who
though
overwhelmed
with
professional
duties
with
the
most
painstaking
care
examined
every
part
of
my
translation
giving
me
furthermore
the
benefit
of
his
critical
observations
the
brilliant
article
on
vondel
and
his
lucifer
with
which
he
has
favored
this
volume
is
an
added
reason
for
my
gratitude
i
also
thank
carpenter
of
columbia
university
for
his
kind
interest
in
my
work
and
for
his
invaluable
introduction
and
finally
to
my
friends
henry
jerome
stockard
the
southern
poet
thomas
hume
professor
of
english
literature
in
the
university
of
north
carolina
and
alphonso
smith
professor
of
english
in
the
university
of
louisiana
i
also
express
my
thanks
for
some
excellent
suggestions
introduction
vondel
lucifer
in
english
it
has
become
a
matter
of
literary
tradition
in
holland
and
out
of
it
that
the
choral
drama
of
lucifer
is
the
great
masterpiece
of
dutch
literature
the
dutch
critics
however
are
by
no
manner
of
means
unanimous
in
this
opinion
in
point
of
fact
it
has
been
assigned
by
some
a
place
relatively
subordinate
among
the
works
of
this
dutch
shakespeare
as
they
are
fond
of
calling
vondel
at
home
no
other
one
however
in
the
long
list
of
his
dramas
and
poems
from
the
pascha
of
to
his
last
translations
of
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
a
literary
career
in
which
one
of
the
greatest
of
dutch
writers
on
its
history
has
pronounced
the
poetry
of
the
netherlands
to
have
attained
its
zenith
will
none
the
less
so
strongly
appeal
to
us
outside
of
holland
as
does
the
lucifer
vondel
tragedy
gysbreght
van
amstel
may
have
found
far
greater
favor
as
a
drama
and
the
poet
may
possibly
in
his
lyrics
have
risen
to
his
greatest
height
but
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
in
spite
of
this
can
have
such
supreme
claims
upon
our
attention
why
this
is
so
is
dependent
upon
a
variety
of
reasons
it
is
not
solely
on
account
of
the
lofty
character
of
the
subject
nor
because
we
have
an
almost
identical
one
in
a
great
poem
in
english
literature
between
which
and
the
lucifer
there
is
a
more
than
generic
resemblance
the
question
of
milton
indebtedness
to
vondel
is
no
longer
to
be
considered
an
open
one
and
has
resolved
itself
into
an
inquiry
simply
as
to
the
amount
of
the
influence
exerted
this
is
an
interesting
phase
of
the
matter
and
since
it
involves
one
of
our
great
classics
an
important
one
the
two
poems
nevertheless
however
great
this
influence
may
be
shown
to
be
are
by
no
manner
of
means
alike
in
detail
and
one
main
source
of
interest
to
us
to
whom
paradise
lost
is
a
heritage
is
undoubtedly
to
compare
the
treatment
of
such
a
subject
by
two
great
poets
of
different
nationalities
the
paramount
reason
however
why
the
lucifer
should
appeal
to
us
is
because
it
is
in
reality
one
of
the
great
poems
of
the
world
because
of
its
inherent
worth
its
seriousness
of
purpose
the
sublimity
of
its
fundamental
conceptions
its
whole
loftiness
of
tone
when
the
critics
praise
others
of
works
for
excellences
not
shared
by
the
lucifer
they
extol
him
immeasurably
for
there
is
enough
in
this
poem
alone
to
have
made
its
author
immortal
it
is
a
matter
of
surprise
that
down
to
the
present
time
there
has
been
no
english
translation
of
lucifer
although
after
all
its
neglect
is
but
a
part
of
the
general
indifference
among
us
to
the
literature
of
holland
in
all
periods
of
its
history
why
this
should
be
so
is
not
quite
apparent
for
wholly
apart
from
the
important
question
of
action
and
reaction
as
a
constituent
part
of
the
world
literature
the
literature
of
holland
has
in
it
in
almost
every
phase
of
its
development
sublimities
and
beauties
of
its
own
which
surely
could
not
always
remain
hidden
an
era
of
translation
was
sure
to
set
in
and
it
is
a
matter
of
significance
that
its
herald
has
even
now
appeared
that
the
first
considerable
translation
of
any
dutch
poet
into
english
should
be
vondel
and
that
the
particular
work
rendered
should
be
the
lucifer
is
from
the
preëminent
place
of
writer
and
poem
in
the
literature
of
the
netherlands
altogether
apt
it
is
particularly
fitting
however
that
such
an
english
translation
both
because
it
is
first
and
because
it
is
vondel
should
be
put
forth
beyond
all
other
places
from
this
old
dutch
city
of
new
york
there
is
surely
more
than
a
passing
interest
in
the
thought
that
at
the
time
of
the
appearance
of
vondel
lucifer
in
old
amsterdam
in
its
reading
public
was
in
part
new
amsterdam
as
well
whether
any
copy
of
the
book
ever
actually
found
its
way
over
to
the
new
netherlands
is
a
matter
that
it
is
hardly
possible
now
to
determine
but
that
it
might
have
been
read
in
the
vernacular
as
readily
here
as
at
home
is
a
fact
of
history
only
two
years
after
the
publication
of
the
lucifer
that
is
in
van
der
donck
as
his
title
page
states
at
the
time

which
occurs
the
familiar
picture
of
nieuw

with
its
fort
and
flagstaff
and
windmill
its
long
row
of
little
dutch
houses
and
its
gibbet
well
in
the
foreground
as
an
unmistakable
symbol
of
law
and
order
strikingly
enough
too
during
the
lifetime
of
vondel
we
were
making
our
own
contributions
to
dutch
literature
modest
they
certainly
may
have
been
but
real

a
translation
of
vondel
from
what
has
been
said
is
accordingly
in
a
certain
sense
a
rehabilitation
a
restoration
to
a
former
status
that
through
the
exigency
of
events
has
been
lost
while
this
may
be
considered
from
some
points
of
view
but
a
curiosity
of
coincidence
it
is
in
reality
as
has
been
assumed
much
more
than
that
it
is
a
pertinent
reminder
of
our
historical
beginnings
a
harking
back
to
the
century
that
saw
our
birth
as
a
province
and
as
a
city
to
the
mother
country
and
to
the
mother
tongue
of
the
literature
of
holland
from
the
lack
of
opportunity
we
know
far
too
little
the
translation
into
english
of
vondel
lucifer
is
not
only
in
and
for
itself
an
event
of
more
than
ordinary
importance
in
literary
history
but
it
can
not
fail
to
awaken
among
us
a
curiosity
as
to
what
else
of
supreme
value
maybe
contained
in
dutch
literature
and
thereby
in
effect
form
a
veritable
open
sesame
to
unlock
its
hidden
treasures

internal
strife
and
had
brought
with
it
the
loss
of
former
friends
his
oldest
son
joost
had
plunged
him
into
financial
difficulties
which
resulted
in
ruin
yet
beneath
all
this
his
sturdy
strength
did
not
fail
him
the
fire
of
his
spirit
not
suppressed
or
smothered
by
the
fuel
of
early
learning
but
constantly
and
richly
fed
with
that
which
was
best
burned
with
a
fierce
flame
ever
hungry
for
new
food
treasures
of
art
and
knowledge
he
had
gathered
even
as
the
culls
her
store
out
of
all
meadows
and
flowers
for
towards
art
and
knowledge
his
heart
ever
inclined
towards
those
muses
of
whom
in
his
birthday
clock
of
william
van
nassau
he
said
for
whom
all
life
i
love
and
without
whom
ah
me
the
glorious
majesty
of
sun
i
could
not
gladly
see
in
an
number
of
long
and
short
poems
he
had
since
those
first
lame
verses
developed
his
art
he
had
taught
his
understanding
to
make
use
of
forms
in
the
construction
of
his
dramas
his
feelings
he
had
made
deeper
and
more
refined
his
taste
he
had
ennobled
his
he
had
increased
his
technique
he
had
made
perfect
did
his
bible
remain
the
fount
from
which
he
preferred
to
draw
the
material
for
his
dramas
he
also
gladly
borrowed
his
motifs
from
the
past
of
classical
antiquity
and
from
the
netherland
life
around
him
his
own
fiery
belief
and
deep
convictions
and
irrepressible
desire
to
give
vent
to
them
caused
the
person
of
the
poet
to
be
seen
more
clearly
in
his
characters
than
we
observe
to
be
the
case
in
the
productions
of
his
masters
the
classic
tragedians
palamedes
is
a
tempestuous
defence
of
the
great
statesman
oldenbarneveldt
a
defence
full
of
intemperate
passion
bitter
reproach
and
burning
satire
how
fiercely
glows
there
in
each
word
in
each
answer
in
transparent
allusion
and
in
scornful
irony
the
fire
of
party
spirit
how
often
too
do
we
there
hear
the
voice
of
the
poet
himself
as
it
trembles
with
tender
sympathy
or
with
lofty
indignation
gÿsbrecht
van
amstel
a
subject
dearer
to
the
burghers
of
amsterdam
than
most
others
is
illuminated
with
the
soft
glimmer
of
mingled
with
airy
incense
that
same
light
that
same
perfume
we
also
perceive
in
maeghden
peter
en
pauwels
and
maria
stuart
the
humble
thankfulness
of
a
dutch
burgher
falls
upon
our
ears
in
the
leeuwendalers
that
charming
pastoral
in
which
the
wanton
play
of
whistling
pipe
and
reed
is
constantly
relieved
by
the
silvery
pure
tones
of
ringing
does
the
history
of
the
development
of
the
vondelian
drama
teach
us
more
about
the
man
vondel
it
also
most
clearly
shows
us
the
evolution
of
the
artist
especially
after
his
translation
of
hippolytus
he
had
weaned
himself
from
the
style
of
seneca
more
and
more
he
became
filled
with
the
grandeur
of
the
greek
tragedians
sophocles
and
euripides
above
all
others
æschylus
he
had
not
yet
made
his
own
that
hour
was
not
yet
come
in
gÿsbrecht
van
amstel
we
feel
for
the
first
time
that
vondel
acknowledges
the
greeks
as
his
masters
that
he
strives
to
follow
them
in
their
sublime
simplicity
in
their
naturalness
that
never
degenerates
to
the
gross
in
their
freedom
of
movement
so
different
from
the
stiffness
of
the
school
of
seneca
in
the
exquisitely
delicate
manner
in
which
the
lyric
is
introduced
into
the
drama
in
joseph
in
dothan
leeuwendalers
and
salomon
we
behold
the
poet
pursuing
the
same
path
and
here
the
influence
of
the
greeks
is
still
more
perceptible
we
have
attempted
in
a
few
rapid
strokes
to
give
a
brief
outline
of
the
time
in
which
the
tragedy
lucifer
had
its
origin
and
also
of
the
man
the
poet
who
created
it
when
vondel
first
conceived
the
plan
of
writing
this
tragedy
is
not
known
however
it
is
well
known
that
this
subject
had
early
made
an
impression
upon
him
in
the
collection
of
prints
entitled
gulden
winkel
for
which
vondel
wrote
the
accompanying
mottoes
we
already
find
the
archangel
whom
god
had
doomed
to
the
pit
of
hell
in
the
brieven
der
heilige
maeghden
and
in
henriette
marie
we
also
find
mention
of
the
revolt
of
the
archangel
in
the
work
the
strife
between
michael
and
lucifer
with
their
legions
is
already
seen
in
prototype
about
he
had
undoubtedly
resolved
upon
a
plan
to
expand
this
subject
into
a
tragedy
was
the
fallen
archangel
for
a
long
period
thus
ever
present
to
the
poet
eye
did
that
subject
so
enthrall
him
that
at
last
he
could
no
longer
resist
the
impelling
desire
to
picture
it
after
his
own
fashion
for
the
causes
of
this
interest
we
shall
not
have
far
to
seek
the
seventeenth
century
was
more
than
almost
any
other
the
age
of
authority
and
lucifer
is
the
tragedy
of
the
individual
in
his
revolt
against
authority
vondel
the
catholic
christian
to
whom
the
ruling
power
was
holy
holy
because
it
came
from
god
vondel
the
amsterdam
burgher
reared
in
the
fear
of
the
lord
and
full
of
reverence
for
those
in
authority
as
long
as
his
conscience
approved
vondel
must
thus
have
been
deeply
impressed
by
the
thought
of
the
presumptuous
attempt
of
the
stadholder
of
god
the
fairest
far
of
all
things
ever
by
god
created
in
his
revolt
against
the
creator
of
his
glory
out
of
this
deep
agitation
this
tragedy
was
born
only
a
genius
such
as
that
of
vondel
or
milton
could
bring
itself
to
undertake
so
dubious
a
task
out
of
such
material
to
create
a
poem
only
the
highest
genius
could
succeed
in
such
gigantic
attempt
only
such
a
poet
can
translate
us
on
the
mighty
wings
of
his
imagination
into
the
portals
of
heaven
can
present
to
us
angels
that
at
the
same
time
are
so
human
that
we
can
put
ourselves
in
their
place
but
who
nevertheless
remain
for
us
a
higher
order
of
beings
can
dare
to
bring
into
a
drama
a
representation
of
god
without
offending
his
majesty
with
chaste
taste
the
poet
has
only
rapidly
sketched
the
scene
of
the
drama
by
means
of
a
few
suggestive
strokes
awaking
in
reader
and
hearer
a
sympathetic
conception
an
illimitable
spaciousness
radiant
with
light
an
eternal
sunshine
more
beautiful
than
that
of
earth
mirroring
itself
in
the
blue
crystalline
above
which
hover
hosts
of
celestial
angels
here
and
there
in
the
background
the
dazzling
pediments
towers
and
battlements
of
ethereal
palaces
far
away
upon
the
heights
beyond
the
golden
port
from
which
god
herald
of
mysteries
came
down
into
view
the
earth
lies
immeasurably
far
below
high
high
above
so
deep
in
boundless
realms
of
light
god
reigns
upon
his
throne
in
that
endless
vast
live
and
move
the
inhabitants
of
heaven
in
tranquil
enjoyment
grief
never
nestled
those
joyful
eaves
until
the
creation
of
man
pride
and
envy
now
awake
in
the
breasts
of
the
angels
and
their
suffering
begins
lucifer
passionate
pride
which
in
its
outbursts
occasionally
reminds
us
of
the
heroes
of
seneca
his
dissimulation
in
the
conversation
with
the
rebellious
angels
his
wretchedness
when
rafael
has
opened
his
eyes
to
an
appreciation
of
his
position
his
obstinate
resistance
and
untamed
defiance
all
this
vondel
has
portrayed
for
us
in
a
masterly
manner
belzebub
more
than
lucifer
is
the
real
genius
of
evil
the
wicked
one
he
is
this
in
his
inclination
towards
subtle
mockery
and
sarcasm
in
his
hypocrisy
in
his
wily
use
of
lucifer
weakness
to
incite
him
to
destruction
in
the
art
with
which
he
while
himself
behind
the
curtain
directs
the
course
of
events
after
the
grand
overture
of
the
drama
wherein
men
and
angels
are
placed
over
against
one
another
we
see
how
in
the
second
act
lucifer
comes
on
the
scene
mounted
on
his
battle
chariot
excited
embittered
and
then
the
action
develops
itself
in
a
remarkably
even
manner
the
clouds
roll
together
more
threateningly
more
heavily
they
impend
the
light
that
glows
from
the
towers
and
battlements
of
heaven
grows
tarnished
the
seditious
angels
gradually
lose
their
lustre
the
thunder
approaches
with
dull
rumblings
one
moment
it
is
stayed
even
at
the
point
of
outbursting
where
rafael
oppressed
and
wan
throws
himself
appealingly
on
lucifer
neck
then
it
precipitates
itself
in
a
terrible
storm
of
strife
between
desperate
rage
and
the
powers
above
the
fall
of
man
is
the
sombre
afterpiece
of
this
intensely
interesting
drama
all
of
this
is
discussed
in
verses
that
know
not
their
equal
in
nobility
of
sound
in
fulness
and
purity
of
tone
in
rapidity
of
change
from
tenderness
to
strength
in
wealth
of
coloring
through
its
opulence
and
beauty
this
tragedy
holds
a
unique
place
in
our
literature
only
adam
in
ballingschap
can
be
placed
beside
it
only
vondel
can
with
vondel
be
compared
if
however
one
should
compare
this
production
with
the
best
that
has
been
produced
in
this
kind
of
poetry
by
other
nations
its
splendor
remains
undimmed
beside
the
masterpieces
of
æschylus
dante
and
milton
vondel
maintain
an
equal
place
to
this
tragedy
and
to
other
works
of
vondel
and
of
some
of
our
other
poets
we
proudly
point
if
strangers
ask
us
in
regard
to
our
right
to
a
place
in
the
world
literature
it
could
therefore
not
be
otherwise
than
that
a
netherlander
who
loves
his
countrymen
should
be
glad
when
the
bar
between
his
literature
and
that
of
the
outside
world
is
raised
when
other
nations
are
furnished
occasion
to
admire
one
of
our
national
treasures
and
are
thereby
enabled
to
have
a
better
knowledge
of
the
character
and
the
significance
of
our
people
we
heartily
rejoice
over
the
fact
that
vondel
drama
has
been
translated
into
english
by
an
american
for
americans
with
whom
we
netherlanders
have
from
time
immemorial
been
on
a
friendly
footing
we
rejoice
too
that
this
rendering
into
a
language
which
is
more
of
a
world
tongue
than
our
own
will
also
give
to
englishmen
an
opportunity
to
enjoy
vondel
work
were
this
translation
an
inferior
one
or
were
it
only
mediocre
we
should
have
no
reason
to
be
glad
then
surely
it
were
better
that
the
translation
had
never
been
made
for
to
be
unknown
is
better
than
to
be
misknown
but
in
this
case
it
is
otherwise
although
no
translation
can
entirely
compensate
for
the
lack
of
the
original
it
is
however
possible
for
the
original
to
be
followed
very
closely
this
is
well
shown
by
this
rendering
which
to
a
high
degree
possesses
the
merit
of
accuracy
while
at
the
same
time
the
spirit
and
the
character
of
tragedy
are
felt
understood
and
interpreted
in
a
remarkable
manner
whoever
is
in
a
position
by
the
comparison
of
the
translation
with
the
original
to
form
an
individual
opinion
of
van
noppen
work
will
probably
be
convinced
even
as
i
have
been
that
here
an
extraordinarily
difficult
task
has
been
magnificently
done
may
this
translation
therefore
aid
in
the
spreading
of
vondel
fame
may
it
also
be
followed
by
many
another
equally
admirable
rendering
of
the
poetry
and
prose
of
the
netherlands
and
may
thereby
furthermore
the
bond
be
drawn
more
closely
between
america
and
that
land
which
at
one
time
possessed
the
opportunity
to
be
the
kalff
of
dutch
literature
of
utrecht

truly
it
is
a
great
thing
for
a
nation
that

will
speak

what

that

the

the

is
a
grander
basis
for
national
exaltation
than
the
possession
of
victorious

glorious
impulse
whose
noblest
action
and

fadeless

the
soul

surely
more

cause

was
the

at
the
bidding
of
the

the
monasteries
those
storehouses

unlocked
their

the

now
for

so
much
for
themselves
as
to
shed
the
light
of
the
past
upon
the
present
to
furnish
suggestions
for
new
discoveries
erasmus
was
but
the
pioneer
of
a
host
of
scholars
and
philosophers
was
but
the
forerunner
of
a
race
of
distinguished
literati
the
following
generation
also
studied
the
moderns
and
the
wonderful
genius
of
italy
as
well
as
the
brilliant
talent
of
france
now
lighted
up
the
dark
recesses
of
the
cathedral
of
gothic
art
the
reformation
like
a
tiny
acorn
first
pierced
the
rich
mould
of
civil
life
then
bursting
into
the
sunshine
it
towered
into
the
sky
of
religious
life
an
imperious
oak
the
dormant
energies
of
the
low
germans
were
now
kindled
into
a
blaze
of
creative
activity
as
in
italy
this
first
revealed
itself
in
the
increased
power
of
the
cities
the
tradesmen
guilds
the
chambers
of
rhetoric
and
the
growing
privileges
of
the
citizens
for
example
the
burghers
of
utrecht
and
of
amsterdam
it
next
manifested
itself
in
the
universities
and
in
the
church
hand
in

with
this
extraordinary
intellectual
development

the
sturdy
manliness
of
a
vigorous
national

it
was
the
era
of
enterprise
and
adventure
of
invention
and

daring
was
the
spirit

the
achievement
of
this
age
this
age
that
dared

the
philosophy
wrested
from

the
race
sought
to
extend
its
intellectual
empire
even
in
the
domain
of

knowledge
like
prometheus
bound
for
centuries
to
the
gloomy
cliff
of
superstition
suddenly
rent
its
bonds
and
stood
forth
in
all
of
its
tremendous
strength
gigantic
and
unshackled
a
god
flaming
to
conquer
the
benighted
realms
of

imagination
like

deep
of

the
world
ran
riot
for
truth
in
england
italy
france
and
spain
as
well
as
in

arose
a
race
of
explorers
that
gave
to
the
earth
another
hemisphere

discovered
another
solar
system
in
the

of
thought
the

called
loud

truth

not

attained
without

freedom

without

universal
struggle

to
precede
universal
achievement
a
whirlwind
of
death
now
swept
over
the
earth
leaving
in
its
wake
carnage
and
disaster
the
passions
of
men
burst
asunder
the
chains
of

swooped
on
the

desolating
rage

the

imagination

suddenly
quickened
into
creative
rapture
by
the
contemplation
of
the
heroism
of
the

of
wickedness
and
folly
the

and

painter

evoked
from
obscurity
only
by
the
call
of
heroes
the

forth
the

of

alone
are

the
foundations
of
the
dutch
republic
had
been
laid
by
a
race
of
cyclops
in
whose
forehead
glowed
the
single
eye
of
freedom
a
race
of
titans
followed
and
built
upon
this
firm
foundation
a
magnificent
temple
of
art
and
science
above
whose
four
golden
portals
were
emblazoned
chiselled
in
deathless
diamond
the
names
vondel
rembrandt
grotius
and
spinoza
the
of
its
worship
it
is
of
vondel
the
one
articulate
voice
of
holland
whose
heart
ever
kept
time
with
the
larger
pulse
of
his
nation
that
we
would
now
speak
childhood
and
youth
justus
van
den
vondel
was
the
son
of
dutch
parents
and
was
born
at
cologne
november
it
is
curious
to
note
that
above
the
door
of
the
house
where
the
greatest
bard
of
the
low
germans
first
saw
the
light
hung
the
sign
of
a
viol
a
maker
of
that
instrument
having
at
one
time
lived
there
the
poet
used
to
point
to
this
fact
as
having
been
prophetic
of
his
poetic
future
and
it
was
surely
not
an
uninspiring
coincidence
the
elder
vondel
was
a
hatter
and
had
fled
to
cologne
from
his
native
city
antwerp
to
escape
the
persecution
then
raging
against
the
anabaptists
of
which
church
he
was
a
zealous
and
devout
member
in
cologne
he
had
courted
and
married
sarah
kranen
whose
father
peter
kranen
also
an
anabaptist
had
likewise
been
driven
from
antwerp
by
the
fury
of
the
romanists
peter
kranen
was
not
without
reputation
in
his
native
city
as
a
poet
and
had
won
some
distinction
in
the
public
contests
of
the
literary
guilds
of
one
of
which
he
was
a
shining
ornament
so
it
seems
that
our
poet
drank
in
the
divine
afflatus
as
it
were
with
his
mother
milk
it
is
related
that
kranen
wife
being
pregnant
was
unable
to
accompany
her
husband
in
his
hurried
flight
and
being
left
behind
was
confined
in
the
city
prison
where
her
severe
fright
prematurely
brought
on
the
crisis
being
strongly
importuned
by
a
cousin
of
the
young
woman
who
was
required
to
furnish
security
for
her
the
magistrates
finally
permitted
her
to
complete
her
travail
at
her
home
after
the
birth
of
her
child
when
her
cousin
again
delivered
her
sorrowful
and
heavy
at
heart
into
the
custody
of
the
jailer
he
whispered
comfortingly
in
her
ear
with
this
hand
i
have
brought
you
here
but
with
the
other
i
shall
take
you
away
again
the
time
of
her
execution
drew
nigh
it
was
intended
that
she
should
be
burnt
at
the
stake
with
a
certain
preacher
of
her
sect
when
this
became
known
the
cousin
went
to
the
dignitaries
of
the
church
and
asked
if
in
case
one
of
her
children
be
baptized
by
a
catholic
priest
the
mother
would
have
a
chance
for
her
life
the
clergy
ever
anxious
to
welcome
an
addition
to
the
fold
and
more
desirous
to
save
a
soul
than
to
burn
a
body
replied
that
it
might
be
so
arranged
one
of
the
children
a
daughter
who
was
already
with
the
father
at
cologne
was
then
hastily
summoned
upon
her
arrival
accordingly
she
was
baptized
after
the
manner
of
the
catholic
ritual
and
received
into
the
church
the
mother
now
free
hastened
to
the
arms
of
her
joyful
spouse
and
the
daughter
who
thus
saved
her
mother
life
afterwards
became
the
mother
of
vondel
so
even
vondel
romanism
of
which
much
will
be
said
farther
on
might
thus
be
considered
as
foreshadowed
and
inherited
the
year
of
vondel
birth
was
also
the
year
of
the
execution
of
mary
queen
of
scots
whose
tragic
end
he
was
destined
to
celebrate
shakespeare
the
most
illustrious
poet
of
the
hereditary
enemies
of
vondel
countrymen
was
just
years
old
and
had
already
been
married
four
years
to
anne
hathaway
william
the
silent
the
father
of
his
country
had
only
three
years
before
in
the
flower
of
his
age
been
cut
off
by
the
red
hand
of
the
assassin
the
early
childhood
of
the
poet
was
spent
at
cologne
he
never
forgot
the
town
of
his
birth
and
after
the
manner
of
the
poets
of
antiquity
sang
its
glories
in
many
an
eloquent
rime
after
the
storm
of
persecution
had
spent
its
fury
the
vondels
slowly
returned
by
way
of
bremen
and
frankfort
to
the
netherlands
they
rode
in
a
rustic
wagon
across
which
were
fastened
two
strong
sticks
from
these
was
suspended
a
cradle
in
which
lay
their
youngest
child
this
simplicity
and
their
modest
demeanor
and
unaffected
piety
so
impressed
the
wagoner
that
he
was
heard
to
say
it
is
just
as
if
i
were
journeying
with
joseph
and
mary
the
family
first
stopped
at
utrecht
where
the
young
joost
went
to
school
his
early
education
however
was
very
meagre
ending
with
his
tenth
year
so
that
he
whose
attainments
were
afterwards
the
admiration
of
his
scholarly
contemporaries
and
the
wonder
of
posterity
commenced
life
with
the
most
threadbare
equipment
of
learning
surely
the
plastic
imagination
of
the
boy
must
have
been
wonderfully
impressed
by
the
grandeur
of
that
gigantic
gothic
pile
the
utrecht
cathedral
and
its
tremendous
campanile
pointing
like
a
huge
index
finger
unerringly
to
god
and
towering
so
sublimely
above
the
beautiful
old
town
and
the
fertile
meadows
all
around
in
we
find
the
family
in
amsterdam
of
which
flourishing
city
the
elder
vondel
had
recently
become
a
citizen
and
where
he
had
opened
a
hosiery
shop
this
business
must
have
proved
remunerative
as
one
of
his
younger
children
his
son
william
afterwards
studied
law
at
orleans
and
then
travelled
to
rome
where
he
applied
himself
to
theology
and
letters
a
course
of
study
which
in
that
age
even
more
than
must
have
been
beyond
the
means
of
even
the
ordinary
citizen
though
the
subject
of
our
sketch
was
not
so
fortunate
in
this
respect
as
his
younger
brother
yet
he
made
good
use
of
his
opportunities
and
it
is
recorded
that
even
before
he
had
reached
his
teens
his
rimes
attracted
considerable
attention
among
the
friends
of
the
family
when
only
thirteen
years
old
we
find
his
verses
complimented
as
showing
unusual
promise
it
was
peter
cornelius
hooft
the
talented
young
poet
son
of
the
burgomaster
of
the
city
who
was
at
that
time
pursuing
a
course
of
study
in
italy
who
incidentally
made
this
passing
reference
in
an
interesting
rimed
epistle
to
the
chamber
of
the
eglantine
at
amsterdam
this
chamber
was
one
of
the
literary
guilds
founded
in
imitation
of
the
french
de
and
it
played
so
important
a
part
in
the
literary
history
of
the
city
and
in
the
life
of
our
poet
that
we
ask
indulgence
if
an
account
of
it
cause
what
may
seem
a
little
digression
under
the
rule
of
the
house
of
burgundy
the
french
feeling
for
dramatic
poetry
had
been
introduced
into
the
netherlands
this
was
fostered
not
only
by
the
exhibitions
of
the
travelling
minstrels
but
also
by
the
impressive
and
often
gorgeous
miracle
and
mystery
plays
of
the
clergy
in
the
wake
of
these
followed
the
more
artistic
morality
plays
these
allegorical
representations
did
much
to
create
a
purer
taste
and
to
waken
a
greater
demand
for
the
drama
the
people
suddenly
began
to
take
unusual
interest
in
declamation
and
in
dramatic
exhibitions
and
chambers
of
rhetoric
for
the
indulgence
of
this
new
taste
were
soon
established
in
all
of
the
prominent
cities
of
the
country
these
societies
also
began
sedulously
to
cultivate
rhetorica
or
literature
and
soon
became
nothing
less
than
an
association
of
literary
guilds
bound
together
in
a
sort
of
social
hanseatic
league
designed
for
their
own
defence
and
for
the
fostering
of
their
beloved
art
each
was
distinguished
by
some
device
and
usually
bore
the
name
of
some
flower
they
were
wont
also
to
compete
against
each
other
in
rhetorical
contests
called
to
which
they
would
march
costumed
in
glorious
masquerade
and
to
the
sound
of
pealing
trumpets
and
of
shrill
melodious
airs
as
was
natural
the
follies
of
the
church
were
too
tempting
a
subject
for
these
chambers
to
resist
and
many
of
them
long
before
the
thundering
polemics
of
luther
were
heard
had
dramatized
a
stinging
satire
on
the
clergy
revealing
their
vices
in
all
of
their
hideous
coarseness
and
making
their
follies
the
butt
of
their
unsparing
mockery
when
the
reformation
therefore
trumped
her
there
throbbed
a
responsive
echo
in
the
hearts
of
the
netherlanders
long
disgusted
as
they
were
with
the
excesses
of
a
dissolute
priesthood
these
societies
therefore
exerted
no
little
influence
on
the
social
religious
and
intellectual
life
of
the
country
and
became
a
powerful
aid
to
the
awakening
of
a
national
consciousness
and
to
the
of
the
language
and
the
literature
among
them
all
no
other
attained
the
distinction
of
the
chamber
of
the
eglantine
at
amsterdam
this
chamber
whose
device
was
blossoming
in
love
was
founded
by
charles
and
to
it
belonged
many
of
the
most
prominent
citizens
of
that
opulent
city
all
religious
discussions
were
forbidden
within
its
walls
and
there
in
that
age
of
religious
discord
and
rabid
intolerance
both
catholic
and
protestant
met
together
in
the
worship
of
apollo
it
was
to
this
honored
body
that
the
name
of
the
young
vondel
was
introduced
and
upon
him
therefore
its
members
kept
an
attentive
eye
we
next
hear
of
vondel
as
a
youth
of
seventeen
he
had
it
seems
all
the
while
been
assisting
his
father
in
the
cares
of
the
little
hosiery
shop
but
his
mind
was
with
his
books
and
he
employed
every
spare
moment
in
reading
or
in
study
about
this
period
a
friend
of
the
family
was
married
and
the
young
poet
must
needs
try
his
wings
accordingly
he
wrote
an
epithalamium
which
unfortunately
for
the
poet
still
survives
as
might
have
been
expected
the
youth
soared
on
icarian
wings
however
he
was
not
conscious
of
this
at
the
time
and
lame
and
faulty
as
these
first
efforts
are
it
may
yet
be
surmised
that
he
felt
the
thrill
of
inspiration
and
the
rapture
of
creating
no
less
than
when
in
later
life
he
forged
those
olympian
thunderbolts
that
fulmined
over
holland
causing
tyrants
to
shake
and
multitudes
to
tremble
soon
after
the
vondel
wrote
a
threnody
on
the
assassination
of
henry
iv
of
france
which
was
but
little
better
than
his
former
effort
we
hear
no
more
of
our
young
poet
till
like
the
youth
shakespeare
he
stands
in
his
young
and
vigorous
manhood
blushing
at
the
altar
maria
de
wolff
was
the
name
of
the
bride
that
the
husband
had
won
to
share
his
destiny
history
does
not
record
the
circumstances
nor
the
incidents
of
his
wooing
but
from
what
we
know
of
his
character
we
will
venture
to
say
that
it
was
ardently
done
of
the
sonnets
and
the
that
this
passion
must
have
inspired
in
the
soul
of
the
young
poet
nothing
unfortunately
seems
to
be
known
he
who
had
as
a
boy
written
tolerable
verses
at
the
marriage
of
another
must
surely
as
a
man
have
done
something
better
at
his
own
all
the
world
loves
a
lover
be
he
ever
so
humble
but
the
loves
of
the
poets
are
of
especial
interest
we
therefore
confess
our
disappointment
that
no
record
exists
wherein
we
could
see
the
poet
in
the
sweet
throes
of
that
passion
but
for
all
that
we
feel
that
he
loved
like
a
poet
and
we
know
that
his
marriage
proved
to
be
a
most
happy
one
his
wife
was
in
full
sympathy
with
his
every
thought
and
aspiration
and
wisely
left
her
husband
to
write
verses
while
she
stayed
behind
the
counter
and
sold
stockings
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
prosperous
of
cologne
and
was
fortunately
of
a
practical
turn
of
mind
thus
when
vondel
succeeded
to
the
business
of
his
father
she
took
upon
herself
not
only
the
management
of
the
shop
but
attended
to
the
as
well
aspiration
in
appeared
vondel
first
drama
the
passover
it
was
the
first
of
that
splendid
series
of
bible
tragedies
to
which
in
the
field
of
the
sacred
drama
neither
ancient
nor
modern
times
furnish
a
parallel
this
play
which
covertly
celebrated
the
recent
escape
of
the
hollanders
from
the
yoke
of
spain
was
played
in
the
brabantian
chamber
of
the
lavender
to
which
vondel
whose
family
came
from
brabant
naturally
belonged
this
poem
showed
the
results
of
his
years
of
study
and
was
far
superior
to
his
earlier
efforts
indeed
it
gave
such
promise
that
vondel
was
immediately
invited
to
become
a
member
of
the
chamber
of
the
eglantine
and
thus
at
once
stood
on
an
equality
with
the
most
distinguished
literati
of
the
day
among
these
was
roemer
visscher
the
round
roemer
as
he
was
known
among
his
intimates
visscher
was
celebrated
for
his
epigrams
and
was
called
the
dutch
martial
he
was
a
good
type
of
the
dutch
merchant
of
his
time
and
on
account
of
his
wit
and
jollity
was
very
popular
with
the
other
members
of
the
society
with
his
friends
coornhert
and
spieghel
he
had
taken
upon
himself
the
serious
task
of
purifying
and
enriching
his
native
tongue
and
it
is
in
the
works
of
these
three
men
who
at
this
time
were
all
well
advanced
in
years
that
we
first
see
the
promise
of
a
literature
and
the
consciousness
of
a
national
destiny
the
stilted
and
artificial
phraseology
of
the
rhetoricians
was
soon
succeeded
by
a
natural
flowing
style
originality
once
more
asserted
its
right
to
a
hearing
nature
was
studied
with
enthusiastic
contemplation
art
was
once
more
set
on
her
high
pedestal
and
worshipped
visscher
looked
with
a
philosophic
eye
on
the
follies
of
the
day
and
his
keenest
epigrams
were
pointed
with
a
honied
humor
that
deprived
them
of
their
sharpest
sting
but
it
was
more
as
a
patron
of
letters
than
as
a
poet
that
he
deserves
to
be
remembered
at
his
house
all
of
the
young
bohemians
of
the
day
were
wont
to
gather
and
many
the
contests
of
wit
and
many
the
battles
in
verse
that
took
place
in
this
the
first
literary
salon
of
the
netherlands
but
there
was
another
attraction
at
the
house
of
this
worthy
burgher
the
jovial
roemer
had
two
daughters
the
blooming
but
sober
anna
and
the
beautiful
and
vivacious
tesselschade
these
young
women
on
account
of
their
many
personal
charms
and
numerous
accomplishments
furnished
a
glowing
theme
to
a
generation
of
poets
it
is
related
that
they
could
each
play
sweetly
on
several
instruments
sing
paint
engrave
on
glass
cut
emblems
embroider
and
converse
brilliantly
they
were
by
no
means
prigs
however
for
they
also
excelled
in
healthful
bodily
exercise
as
swimming
rowing
and
skating
and
they
were
no
less
discreet
and
modest
than
accomplished
and
refined
nor
must
it
be
forgotten
that
they
themselves
also
wrote
verses
full
of
sweetness
and
tenderness
verses
too
not
without
lofty
and
noble
sentiment
that
are
yet
treasured
among
the
brightest
gems
in
holland
diadem
of
song
it
was
into
this
charming
patrician
circle
that
our
poet
was
now
introduced
and
he
manfully
continued
his
attempts
to
remedy
the
defects
in
his
education
that
he
might
meet
the
many
talented
and
learned
men
who
came
there
on
an
equal
footing
vondel
was
now
years
old
and
began
to
apply
himself
assiduously
to
the
study
of
the
languages
he
took
lessons
in
latin
from
an
englishman
and
through
his
great
industry
he
was
soon
able
to
read
virgil
and
ovid
he
also
began
the
study
of
french
and
translated
the
glory
of
solomon
of
du
bartas
which
he
considered
a
most
admirable
poem
about
the
same
time
he
wrote
his
second
tragedy
the
jerusalem
desolate
which
on
account
of
its
severe
simplicity
and
elevated
style
was
the
theme
of
much
favorable
comment
at
the
house
of
the
visschers
vondel
was
wont
to
meet
on
terms
of
easy
comradery
among
other
rising
young
men
of
the
day
the
erratic
but
brilliant
gerard
brederoo
the
greatest
writer
of
comedies
that
holland
has
ever
produced
brederoo
was
the
son
of
a
poor
shoemaker
of
amsterdam
and
on
account
of
his
extraordinary
talents
was
eagerly
welcomed
into
the
most
select
circles
quite
a
contrast
was
the
young
aristocrat
peter
cornelius
hooft
of
whom
we
have
already
spoken
hooft
was
a
patrician
of
the
patricians
and
was
the
most
accomplished
and
elegant
man
of
his
day
the
first
gentleman
of
his
age
he
had
already
distinguished
himself
by
several
remarkable
poems
a
superb
pastoral
and
one
or
two
powerful
tragedies
it
was
in
the
field
of
history
and
biography
however
that
he
was
to
win
his
greenest
laurels
his
history
of
the
netherlands
and
his
biography
of
henry
iv
of
france
written
in
a
terse
forcible
epigrammatic
style
have
gained
for
him
the
appellation
of
the
dutch
tacitus
motley
calls
him
one
of
the
great
historians
of
the
world
then
there
was
jan
starter
the
son
of
an
english
brownist
who
was
destined
to
be
one
of
the
sweetest
lyrists
of
his
adopted
country
and
laurens
reael
another
scion
of
aristocracy
a
handsome
young
man
of
some
poetic
power
and
considerable
learning
fated
to
become
the
friend
of
the
great
oldenbarneveldt
and
after
a
splendid
career
as
a
soldier
the
of
the
dutch
east
indies
another
visitor
to
this
hospitable
house
was
samuel
coster
a
dramatist
of
no
mean
ability
who
is
now
chiefly
remembered
as
the
founder
of
coster
academy
an
institution
founded
in
imitation
of
the
accademia
della
crusca
of
florence
anna
and
tesselschade
were
of
course
the
centre
of
this
constellation
of
literary
stars
and
few
of
the
young
men
who
met
at
their
home
left
it
with
heart
unscorched
by
the
fierce
blaze
of
love
vondel
was
already
married
but
to
the
passion
that
these
two
beautiful
women
excited
in
most
of
the
others
dutch
literature
owes
its
most
exquisite
love
lyrics
the
ardent
hooft
wooed
the
staid
anna
only
to
be
rejected
however
the
young
knight
sought
and
soon
obtained
consolation
elsewhere
brederoo
with
all
the
fervor
of
his
romantic
nature
poured
out
his
soul
in
a
cycle
of
burning
love
poems
at
the
feet
of
the
and
tesselschade
to
her
too
he
dedicated
his
tragedy
lucelle
calling
the
object
of
his
adoration
the
honor
of
our
city
the
glory
of
our
age
few
women
in
any
epoch
have
exerted
such
wonderful
influence
upon
the
literature
of
their
time
not
a
poet
of
the
day
who
was
not
inspired
by
their
beauty
and
character
not
one
furthermore
who
did
not
dedicate
to
them
some
production
of
his
genius
and
yet
they
do
not
seem
to
have
been
the
least
spoiled
by
such
excessive
notice
their
good
sense
and
modesty
only
heightened
the
excellent
impression
excited
by
their
beauty
and
their
talents
how
incomplete
a
sketch
of
vondel
life
and
age
would
be
without
a
more
than
passing
reference
to
these
accomplished
sisters
will
be
better
appreciated
when
we
see
the
poet
himself
paying
court
to
one
of
them
charmed
not
only
into
a
passion
of
the
heart
but
also
into
taking
a
step
which
exerted
a
powerful
influence
on
his
life
and
works
at
the
visschers
in
the
circle
of
his
friends
the
aspiring
poet
was
wont
to
read
the
latest
effusions
of
his
pen
that
he
was
much
benefited
by
the
criticism
to
which
his
verses
were
there
subjected
can
not
be
doubted
his
friendship
with
the
most
noted
men
of
the
day
warmed
his
ambition
into
a
fever
of
aspiration
and
like
milton
he
early
determined
to
devote
his
whole
life
to
the
cultivation
of
his
beloved
art
with
the
aid
of
hooft
and
reael
he
translated
the
troades
of
seneca
which
he
then
sublimated
into
a
tragedy
of
his
own
the
hecuba
of
amsterdam
this
evoked
considerable
praise
from
the
critics
of
the
day
at
this
time
also
he
showed
his
advancement
in
technique
and
his
improvement
in
style
by
several
lyrics
of
extraordinary
merit
it
was
thus
in
the
midst
of
an
admiring
circle
of
distinguished
friends
that
we
find
vondel
cultivating
his
art
there
in
the
bosom
of
that
catholic
family
the
visschers
the
poets
of
that
age
found
rest
from
the
storm
of
religious
discord
that
raged
without
arminian
and
gomarist
remonstrant
and
were
waging
that
fierce
battle
of
the
creeds
that
is
yet
the
foulest
blot
upon
the
fair
name
of
the
heroic
and
tolerant
republic
thus
the
visscher
mansion
was
the
temple
of
the
muses
where
beauty
alone
was
worshipped
religion
was
left
by
the
visitor
at
the
threshold
art
alone
was
the
garment
that
gave
admittance
to
this
of
poetry
and
philosophy
storm
and
stress
whether
through
the
contemplation
of
the
fierce
dissensions
that
then
raged
in
the
little
republic
or
through
a
natural
melancholy
of
temperament
vondel
now
became
subject
to
the
most
distressing
depression
occasionally
he
would
flash
from
his
gloom
into
one
of
those
firebrands
of
invective
that
thrown
into
the
ranks
of
his
enemies
created
a
blaze
of
discord
from
one
end
of
the
country
to
the
other
occasionally
also
he
was
inspired
for
loftier
themes
as
his
ode
to
agnes
which
first
showed
his
tendency
towards
catholicism
then
he
would
relapse
into
his
melancholy
he
lost
his
appetite
and
became
afflicted
with
various
bodily
ills
he
seemed
hastening
into
a
decline
this
lasted
several
years
during
which
several
important
changes
had
taken
place
not
only
among
his
friends
but
also
in
the
ruling
powers
of
the
state
on
the
of
may
john
van
oldenbarneveldt
the
aged
advocate
of
the
the
greatest
statesman
of
his
time
and
the
fiery
patriot
upon
whom
had
fallen
the
sacred
mantle
of
william
the
silent
was
beheaded
he
had
watched
the
destinies
of
the
infant
republic
with
the
tender
solicitude
of
a
loving
shepherd
he
was
now
devoured
by
the
wolves
who
in
the
guise
of
religion
and
of
patriotism
had
crept
into
the
fold
he
had
given
eighty
years
of
devotion
to
the
of
his
country
he
was
now
to
seal
that
devotion
with
his
blood
he
had
made
his
native
land
a
theme
of
glory
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
he
was
now
accused
of
selling
that
glory
for
the
gold
which
he
had
always
despised
a
thankless
generation
had
under
the
cloak
of
virtue
committed
one
of
the
most
infamous
and
revolting
crimes
in
human
annals
where
shall
we
find
a
parallel
the
gray
hairs
of
the
man
his
learning
his
ability
his
unsullied
life
his
splendid
achievements
in
behalf
of
his
native
land
his
grand
renown
his
unselfish
devotion
his
patriotism
all
this
must
be
considered
when
we
compare
his
sad
end
with
the
fate
of
the
other
political
martyrs
of
history
too
many
of
whom
have
been
unduly
exalted
by
the
manner
of
their
death
is
it
to
be
wondered
at
that
such
an
important
event
caused
the
poet
the
revulsion
that
only
comes
to
souls
is
it
surprising
furthermore
that
that
revulsion
found
its
expression
in
what
is
perhaps
the
finest
satirical
drama
of
modern
times
this
period
was
the
crisis
in
our
poet
life
the
or
gomarists
as
the
extreme
calvinists
were
called
having
disposed
of
their
hated
enemy
oldenbarneveldt
had
now
begun
to
play
havoc
with
the
liberties
of
the
people
art
and
literature
next
suffered
through
the
blasting
censorship
of
their
fanatical
clergy
the
religious
tolerance
that
had
formed
the
glory
of
the
country
only
a
decade
before
was
now
succeeded
by
a
rabid
bigotry
that
with
insensate
fury
cut
at
the
vitals
of
all
that
was
healthful
and
inspiring
life
property
and
freedom
were
in
peril
nothing
was
safe
grotius
the
father
of
international
law
and
also
so
distinguished
as
a
scholar
that
he
was
called
the
wonder
of
the
age
was
imprisoned
with
the
fate
of
his
friend
the
great
advocate
staring
him
in
the
face
from
this
fate
moreover
he
was
only
saved
by
the
diplomatic
ingenuity
of
his
devoted
wife
who
aided
him
to
escape
from
his
prison
at
loevestein
ensconced
in
an
empty
which
the
unsuspecting
warden
of
the
castle
thought
full
of
books
others
of
note
were
in
hiding
or
in
exile
the
boasted
freedom
of
the
freed
netherlands
had
turned
to
the
direst
form
of
oppression
the
tyranny
of
a
religious
oligarchy
and
yet
it
was
not
an
easy
victory
for
the
every
inch
was
bitterly
contested
by
their
foes
in
christ
the
moderate
calvinists
or
remonstrants
this
struggle
like
the
conflicts
of
the
florentine
factions
of
the
guelfs
and
ghibellines
divided
the
country
into
two
hostile
camps
even
those
of
other
religions
allied
themselves
with
the
one
or
other
of
these
sects
for
sect
had
now
come
to
mean
party
vondel
with
whom
religion
and
patriotism
were
fused
into
one
white
heat
was
not
long
in
choosing
the
party
of
the
remonstrants
the
side
of
freedom
we
shall
hereafter
view
this
remarkable
man
as
the
poet
militant
for
having
once
taken
the
sword
in
hand
he
did
not
let
it
fall
until
his
arm
was
palsied
by
death
much
as
he
loved
peace
his
enemies
hereafter
took
good
care
that
he
should
never
want
occasion
to
defend
himself
it
must
be
added
however
that
the
poet
was
even
more
renowned
for
attack
than
for
defence
he
was
ever
at
the
head
of
the
onset
ever
in
the
thickest
of
the
fray
the
sword
of
this
crusader
for
the
liberties
of
his
country
the
most
formidable
and
dreaded
weapon
of
the
age
was
a
pen
and
the
production
that
fell
like
a
bombshell
into
the
gomarist
camp
was
the
allegorical
tragedy
of
palamedes
or
murdered
innocence
under
cover
of
the
ancient
legend
of
palamedes
which
lent
itself
most
readily
to
such
analogy
he
had
portrayed
the
murder
of
the
old
advocate
and
painted
his
judges
in
such
strong
colors
and
with
such
accurate
delineation
that
each
was
recognized
and
forever
invested
with
the
shame
and
infamy
he
so
richly
merited
the
greatest
excitement
prevailed
and
the
first
edition
of
the
poem
was
sold
in
a
few
days
the
goliath
of
error
slain
by
the
pebble
of
satire
lay
on
the
ground
gasping
in
agony
the
david
who
had
with
one
swift
of
thought
accomplished
this
wonderful
feat
suddenly
found
himself
the
most
famous
man
in
both
camps
in
the
meantime
the
party
in
power
sought
to
repress
the
book
and
as
the
poet
was
thought
to
be
in
danger
of
imprisonment
or
of
even
a
more
tragic
fate
he
was
advised
by
his
friends
to
go
into
hiding
which
he
did
threats
were
made
against
the
man
who
had
so
rashly
dared
the
fury
of
those
relentless
iconoclasts
the
reigning
gomarists
it
was
muttered
that
he
ought
to
be
taken
to
the
hague
to
be
tried
even
as
oldenbarneveldt
meanwhile
vondel
was
concealed
at
the
house
of
hans
de
wolff
a
brother
of
his
wife
who
was
also
married
to
his
sister
clementia
they
were
however
afraid
to
harbor
him
any
longer
and
his
sister
it
is
said
upbraided
him
for
his
itch
for
writing
saying
that
no
good
could
come
of
it
and
that
it
would
be
better
for
him
to
attend
more
strictly
to
his
business
vondel
only
reply
was
i
shall
yet
tell
them
sharper
truths
and
he
straightway
sat
down
and
wrote
some
cutting
pasquinades
these
however
upon
his
sister
advice
he
threw
into
the
fire
which
he
afterwards
regretted
he
next
found
shelter
in
the
house
of
a
friend
laurens
baake
who
received
him
gladly
here
he
was
hidden
several
days
and
the
sons
and
daughters
of
his
host
being
highly
cultivated
and
exceedingly
fond
of
poetry
were
much
pleased
with
the
society
of
so
distinguished
a
poet
and
for
him
made
things
as
comfortable
as
possible
vondel
ever
proved
grateful
for
the
many
favors
received
at
their
hands
in
the
hour
of
his
need
his
was
at
last
discovered
and
he
was
brought
before
the
court
the
plea
made
by
his
lawyer
in
his
behalf
was
that
the
play
was
poet
work
and
could
be
otherwise
interpreted
than
was
commonly
done
some
of
the
judges
expressed
themselves
very
severely
and
if
their
counsel
had
prevailed
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
the
poet
career
would
have
ended
with
the
palamedes
however
the
old
batavian
spirit
also
asserted
itself
others
saying
that
civil
liberty
was
but
a
mockery
when
a
man
was
no
longer
allowed
the
freedom
of
speech
the
result
of
the
trial
was
that
vondel
was
fined
three
hundred
guldens
which
was
paid
by
a
friend
indeed
by
one
of
the
judges
themselves
who
was
secretly
favorable
to
vondel
and
his
party
and
had
encouraged
the
poet
to
write
this
very
drama
we
are
here
reminded
of
the
fate
of
the
great
florentine
dante
a
patriot
yet
an
exile
accused
of
treason
and
under
sentence
of
death
vondel
forced
to
flee
from
an
oligarchy
of
unctuous
hypocrites
in
fear
of
his
life
and
arraigned
as
a
fomenter
of
discord
the
ideas
of
the
great
hollander
on
government
and
on
politics
also
were
not
unlike
the
ideal
ghibellinism
of
the
illustrious
tuscan
of
course
the
very
nature
of
the
play
made
it
popular
and
the
various
attempts
at
its
suppression
only
made
it
more
so
two
other
editions
shortly
followed
within
a
few
years
thirty
editions
were
sold
in
vetitum
semper
cupimusque
prince
maurice
the
stadholder
whose
powerful
personality
on
account
of
his
share
in
the
death
of
the
advocate
was
also
severely
handled
by
the
poet
died
while
vondel
was
giving
the
finishing
touches
to
his
drama
long
years
afterwards
when
the
poet
was
an
old
man
he
was
wont
to
relate
how
on
the
very
morning
that
the
news
came
to
amsterdam
from
the
hague
that
the
stadholder
was
on
his
his
wife
came
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
that
led
to
the
room
where
he
was
writing
and
cried
husband
the
prince
is
dying
to
which
he
replied
let
him
die
i
am
already
tolling
his
knell
frederic
henry
who
was
the
next
stadholder
was
known
to
be
at
heart
in
favor
of
the
remonstrants
it
was
reported
that
the
whole
tragedy
was
read
to
him
in
his
palace
and
that
he
was
exceedingly
pleased
with
it
finding
much
of
interest
in
the
various
episodes
strange
to
say
upon
the
walls
of
the
room
where
he
heard
the
drama
hung
a
piece
of
tapestry
upon
which
the
history
of
the
greek
palamedes
was
artistically
pictured
pointing
to
this
the
prince
said
mockingly
this
tapestry
should
be
taken
away
otherwise
they
might
suppose
that
i
also
favor
the
cause
of
palamedes
apart
from
its
influence
on
the
time
and
the
interest
of
its
allegorical
allusions
the
palamedes
is
a
splendid
tragedy
and
its
intrinsic
worth
alone
would
make
it
immortal
one
of
the
choruses
especially
is
justly
celebrated
for
its
idyllic
beauty
it
has
often
been
compared
to
the
of
milton
and
indeed
it
bears
in
many
particulars
much
resemblance
to
that
exquisite
lyric
tesselschade
soon
after
the
completion
of
the
palamedes
vondel
was
again
for
a
long
time
in
a
state
of
hopeless
melancholy
he
did
not
yield
to
its
depressing
influence
however
and
at
the
age
of
forty
began
the
study
of
greek
in
which
he
made
rapid
progress
he
still
associated
with
his
though
no
longer
at
the
home
of
roemer
visscher
this
patron
of
learning
had
now
been
dead
for
several
years
other
changes
also
had
taken
place
starter
after
the
publication
of
his
frisian
bower
seized
with
the
spirit
of
adventure
had
enlisted
as
a
private
soldier
and
died
a
few
years
afterwards
in
one
of
the
battles
of

thirty
years
war
laurens
reael
had
gone
to
the
indies
and
after
winning
the
highest
honors
as
soldier
and
statesman
had
come
back
again
to
his
native
land
which
he
continued
to
serve
in
a
diplomatic
capacity
for
many
years
hooft
had
been
honored
by
prince
maurice
with
one
of
the
highest
dignities
in
the
state
he
had
been
appointed
judge
of
muiden
and
here
in
his
castle
in
the
society
of
his
lovely
wife
and
beautiful
children
he
gave
himself
up
to
his
books
it
was
here
in
his
little
tower
one
of
the
four
turrets
of
this
castle
that
he
wrote
his
splendid
history
here
he
composed
many
of
those
charming
lyrics
that
combine
the
lusciousness
of
the
italian
after
which
they
were
modelled
with
the
domestic
sweetness
of
the
dutch
here
too
he
wrote
his
great
tragedies
baeto
or
the
origin
of
the
hollanders
and
gerardt
van
velsen
hooft
was
essentially
a
student
and
a
scholar
a
thinker
rather
than
a
fighter
he
did
not
therefore
like
vondel
the
burgher
plunge
with
flaming
soul
into
the
conflict
the
patrician
was
too
fond
of
studious
contemplation
and
of
elegant
ease
to
allow
the
discord
of
the
outside
world
to
mar
the
serene
harmony
of
his
retirement
brederoo
had
burnt
himself
out
with
the
intensity
of
his
passion
for
his
adored
but
not
adoring
tesselschade
poor
fellow
after
all
his
poetic
wooing
and
flattering
dedications
he
had
met
with
the
bitter
disappointment
of
a
refusal
and
after
a
meteoric
career
died
at
the
age
of
a
man
the
delicate
on
that
æolian
harp
had
been
snapped
by
the
rude
blast
of
unrequited
love
and
from
the
broken
chords
now
surged
the
mournful
music
of
the
grave
his
dazzling
genius
eclipsed
in
its
splendor
by
the
swift
night
of
death
was
quenched
forever
such
was
the
sad
but
romantic
ending
of
the
most
brilliant
man
of
his
age
the
greatest
humorist
that
holland
has
yet
produced
and
tesselschade
the
beautiful
inspirer
of
this
passion
to
her
too
time
had
brought
its
changes
neptune
trident
it
seems
had
more
attraction
for
her
than
the
lyre
of
apollo
whose
strings
she
had
so
often
set
into
melodious
vibration
after
being
wooed
for
a
whole
decade
by
all
the
younger
poets
she
had
at
last
been
won
by
a
gallant
allart
krombalgh
and
was
now
living
happily
in
blissful
quiet
with
her
husband
at
alkmaar
tesselschade
was
now
thirty
years
of
age
and
had
lost
none
of
the
extraordinary
beauty
of
early
youth
deep
golden
hair
of
which
each
tiny
thread
seemed
just
the
string
for
cupid
bow
large
dark
eyes
darting
rays
of
love
and
deep
with
infinitudes
of
tenderness
a
low
but
broad
smooth
forehead
of
marble
whiteness
an
exquisite
mouth
a
decided
chin
that
spoke
of
a
will
reserved
a
chiselled
nose
with
delicate
sensuous
nostrils
these
were
the
most
striking
features
of
a
face
that
was
as
remarkable
for
its
earnest
and
captivating
expression
as
for
its
great
beauty
and
radiant
intelligence
add
to
this
a
glowing
complexion
of
wonderful
purity
and
a
slender
but
figure
and
you
have
a
picture
of
the
most
beautiful
and
talented
woman
of
her
generation
all
the
poets
honored
the
bride
with
their
choicest
verses
elevated
as
was
vondel
epithalamium
sweet
and
graceful
as
was
hooft
agreeable
as
were
the
many
other
poems
that
the
occasion
inspired
the
young
constantine
huyghens
wrote
a
eulogy
in
a
tender
and
delicious
strain
that
surpassed
them
all
at
alkmaar
the
happy
couple
had
an
ideal
home
exquisitely
furnished
with
pictures
and
embroidery
done
by
the
skilful
hands
of
tesselschade
herself
here
with
art
and
music
in
the
midst
of
the
amenities
of
domestic
life
she
lived
many
happy
years
tesselschade
however
did
not
give
up
her
passion
for
poetry
she
continued
her
relations
with
the
charming
circle
of
her
admirers
and
corresponded
with
hooft
in
italian
even
before
her
marriage
she
had
begun
translating
the
gerusalemme
liberata
of
tasso
and
now
with
the
aid
of
hooft
the
best
italian
scholar
in
the
netherlands
she
continued
this
absorbing
work
this
version
was
never
printed
and
has
unfortunately
been
lost
in
her
sister
anna
the
friend
and
correspondent
of
rubens
visited
middelburg
the
capital
of
zealand
where
she
met
the
shining
lights
of
the
school
of
dort
as
the
didactic
writers
of
the
day
were
called
at
the
head
of
these
was
the
celebrated
father
cats
the
poet
of
the
commonplace
the
most
popular
though
by
no
means
the
greatest
poet
of
the
netherlands
simon
van
beaumont
the
governor
a
lyrist
of
some
talent
joanna
coomans
called
the
pearl
of
zealand
and
jacob
westerbaen
also
gave
her
sweet
welcome
attentions
were
showered
on
the
honored
guest
and
her
visit
gave
occasion
to
that
collection
of
lyrics
entitled
the
zealand
nightingale
which
was
dedicated
to
her
upon
her
return
from
zealand
anna
was
also
married
and
from
this
time
forth
she
slowly
ceased
her
literary
relations
with
the
school
of
amsterdam
and
now
gave
herself
entirely
up
to
domestic
duties
not
so
tesselschade
her
imagination
was
too
intense
her
conceptions
too
vivid
to
find
any
attraction
in
the
realistic
didacticism
of
the
catsian
circle
her
muse
was
not
to
be
restrained
by
household
cares
her
friendship
with
hooft
and
vondel
remained
unbroken
and
we
shall
have
occasion
to
meet
her
again
since
his
palamedes
vondel
overwhelmed
with
his
strange
depression
had
written
but
little
in
he
burst
into
a
blaze
of
satire
that
swept
the
country
like
a
whirlwind
of
flame
his
poems
of
this
year
were
entitled
libertatis
and
were
of
unsparing
severity
the
evils
of
the
time
said
the
poet
are
too
to
be
eradicated
by
a
poultice
of
honey
like
juvenal
and
persius
he
did
not
spare
the
knife
although
he
knew
that
every
thrust
only
made
his
enemies
more
bitter
and
his
own
position
more
uncomfortable
his
absolute
fearlessness
was
the
theme
of
admiration
not
only
among
his
friends
but
even
among
his
enemies
the
higher
the
person
the
stronger
his
invective
the
more
powerful
the
object
of
his
dislike
the
more
cutting
the
edge
of
his
sarcasm
never
was
satire
so
crushing
and
at
the
same
time
so
keen
never
mockery
so
unanswerable
polemic
so
overwhelming
a
titan
had
thrown
mountains
of
irony
upon
the
heads
of
a
generation
of
vipers
their
discomfiture
was
so
complete
that
not
even
a
hiss
broke
from
the
silence
of
their
annihilation
the
whited
sepulchres
of
the
sovereign
hypocrites
of
the
republic
now
stood
black
as
night
in
the
face
of
noon
though
a
fiery
patriot
and
an
enthusiastic
adherent
of
the
house
of
orange
vondel
received
but
little
favor
at
the
hands
of
frederic
henry
this
was
probably
due
to
the
poet
unpopularity
with
the
clergy
and
to
the
hatred
that
he
had
excited
among
the
church
party
in
power
the
uncompromising
whose
enmity
the
stadholder
would
doubtless
have
incurred
by
an
open
friendship
with
aman
whose
avowed
determination
it
was
to
accomplish
their
downfall
about
this
time
occurred
the
death
of
william
van
den
vondel
a
younger
brother
of
the
poet
whom
he
loved
most
tenderly
this
youth
had
been
educated
in
france
and
italy
and
possessed
extraordinary
gifts
and
many
accomplishments
he
had
also
written
some
poems
of
great
promise
but
was
now
cut
off
in
the
flower
of
his
youth
by
an
insidious
malady
that
he
had
brought
with
him
from
italy
a
sickness
thought
by
many
to
have
been
due
to
poison
the
poet
never
ceased
to
mourn
this
idolized
brother
and
almost
half
a
century
later
he
was
heard
to
say
i
could
cry
when
i
think
of
my
brother
he
was
much
my
superior
in
the
same
year
vondel
made
a
journey
to
denmark
in
the
interest
of
his
business
upon
his
return
journey
he
was
the
guest
of
sir
jacob
van
dÿk
the
minister
from
the
court
of
sweden
to
the
hague
at
van
dÿk
country
seat
in
gottenburg
he
wrote
a
poem
in
honor
of
gustavus
adolphus
this
production
is
chiefly
remarkable
as
foreshadowing
several
important
political
events
he
prophesied
that
the
great
swede
would
attack
the
emperor
of
rome
tread
upon
the
neck
of
austria
and
bring
the
eternal
city
itself
into
a
panic
of
fright
all
of
which
happened
within
four
years
he
was
however
silent
as
to
the
fate
of
the
king
and
said
nothing
about
his
tragic
death
in
the
hour
of
victory
so
we
here
also
see
vondel
in
the
capacity
of
the
classic
and
of
the
hebrew
seer
before
his
piercing
ken
even
the
time
to
come
delivered
up
its
hoarded
secrets
the
past
the
present
and
the
future
were
the
provinces
of
the
grand
empire
reigned
over
by
his
kingly
spirit
the
muider
kring
the
old
chamber
of
the
eglantine
had
now
fallen
into
a
decline
many
of
its
choicest
spirits
had
gone
over
to
coster
academy
the
others
vondel
and
his
friends
as
has
already
been
related
were
accustomed
to
meet
for
mutual
help
and
criticism
at
the
hospitable
home
of
the
visschers
after
this
charming
home
was
broken
up
the
literary
centre
of
the
amsterdam
school
was
changed
to
the
castle
of
muiden
a
few
miles
from
the
metropolis
at
the
visschers
the
budding
talent
of
the
country
had
been
carefully
nurtured
and
placed
in
the
warm
sunlight
of
a
mutual
and
invigorating
sympathy
at
muiden
however
it
was
seen
in
its
full
flower
it
was
here
that
the
literary
genius
of
the
netherlands
reached
its
highest
efflorescence
nor
has
it
ever
again
reached
the
sublime
standard
of
those
golden
days
soon
after
being
appointed
judge
of
muiden
hooft
had
rebuilt
the
old
castle
and
now
it
stood
a
romantic
structure
crowned
with
turrets
and
towers
it
was
picturesquely
situated
on
an
island
in
the
centre
of
a
small
lake
a
feudal
drawbridge
connected
it
with
the
outside
world
and
it
was
embowered
in
lofty
trees
and
surrounded
by
gardens
and
orchards
there
is
no
more
charming
picture
in
literature
than
that
of
the
aristocratic
host
of
muiden
with
his
handsome
intelligent
face
and
his
elegant
manners
in
the
midst
of
his
guests
the
genius
and
the
flower
of
the
netherlands
a
scene
rendered
still
more
interesting
by
the
presence
of
talented
and
beautiful
women
here
beneath
the
shade
of
the
spreading
lindens
and
the
noble
beeches
they
would
lighten
the
heavy
summer
hours
by
games
and
conversation
and
by
the
discussion
of
affairs
of
state
or
perhaps
too
they
would
listen
to
the
classic
muse
of
the
learned
barlæus
or
to
the
dramatic
recitations
of
daniel
mostert
or
occasionally
o
inestimable
privilege
they
would
be
thrilled
by
the
powerful
verses
of
the
sublime
vondel
destined
to
become
the
greatest
poet
of
his
country
here
also
they
were
often
enchanted
by
the
tender
songs
of
the
beautiful
tesselschade
the
dutch
nightingale
richly
warbling
her
own
deep
notes
while
her
nimble
fingers
swept
the
guitar
or
perhaps
singing
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
celebrated
zweling
the
first
great
composer
of
the
netherlands
or
it
may
be
that
another
sweet
singer
francesca
duarte
would
sometimes
add
her
mellow
tones
to
those
delightful
strains
while
the
distinguished
company
applauded
with
eloquent
silence
here
too
before
her
apostasy
to
the
dort
school
came
the
gentle
anna
visscher
to
read
her
noble
rimes
while
often
also
vossius
the
first
latinist
of
his
age
and
laurens
reael
the
renowned
statesman
soldier
and
erotic
poet
would
lend
the
dignity
of
their
presence
here
furthermore
came
the
young
huyghens
the
most
versatile
of
a
versatile
race
and
one
of
the
most
celebrated
wits
and
poets
of
his
day
the
muider
kring
the
muiden
circle
as
this
salon
is
known
in
the
literary
history
of
the
netherlands
is
yet
the
proudest
boast
and
the
perennial
glory
of
holland
for
this
was
the
elizabethan
era
of
dutch
literature
hooft
as
the
social
centre
of
a
literary
constellation
exerted
perhaps
even
more
influence
upon
his
age
by
his
magnetic
personality
than
by
his
remarkable
writings
struggle
and
achievement
it
was
amid
such
congenial
surroundings
that
the
genius
of
vondel
grew
to
maturity
soon
after
the
satires
of
he
translated
seneca
hippolytus
which
he
dedicated
to
grotius
grotius
was
still
in
exile
and
the
publisher
of
this
translation
fearing
the
displeasure
of
the
authorities
tore
the
dedication
leaf
out
of
every
copy
vondel
next
effort
was
the
farmer
catechism
which
was
full
of
a
rollicking
humor
that
at
the
same
time
was
not
without
its
sting
vossius
in
his
professional
study
at
leiden
laughed
heartily
upon
reading
it
and
it
occasioned
much
mirth
among
the
arminians
or
remonstrants
everywhere
some
satirical
poems
of
the
same
period
were
much
keener
and
unmercifully
ridiculed
the
blunders
of
the
government
the
general
extravagance
and
the
increase
of
avarice
and
ostentation
among
the
citizens
shortly
after
this
came
his
decretum
horribile
a
powerful
polemic
against
the
calvinistic
doctrine
of
election
and
predestination
as
interpreted
by
the
gomarists
this
savage
attack
on
their
belief
filled
the
with
rage
and
caused
the
name
of
the
poet
to
be
execrated
as
the
personification
of
infamy
hear
his
fierce
outburst
against
the
great
calvin
himself
that
monster
dread
that
from
a
pours
out
the
drug
of
hell
in
unctuous
malice
and
makes
the
gracious
god
a
very
fiend
no
wonder
that
in
the
eyes
of
these
stern
followers
of
calvin
he
was
himself
a
very
devil
nor
is
it
extravagant
to
say
that
he
was
hardly
less
feared
by
them
than
his
satanic
majesty
himself
from
every
pulpit
the
hurled
anathemas
at
the
offending
poet
not
one
of
their
gatherings
from
which
his
name
did
not
rise
to
the
throne
of
divine
grace
in
clouds
of
execration
not
a
preacher
of
the
sect
that
did
not
call
down
the
wrath
of
jehovah
upon
the
head
of
the
blasphemer
who
had
dared
to
mock
the
arrogant
tenets
of
his
exclusive
faith
vondel
however
did
not
pause
in
his
path
one
instant
answering
their
maledictions
with
stinging
satire
and
their
abuse
with
overwhelming
invective
yet
it
must
not
be
thought
that
our
poet
was
forever
forging
thunderbolts
of
satire
at
the
blaze
of
his
wrath
he
also
found
time
for
the
amenities
of
life
and
thus
we
often
find
him
in
the
companionship
of
those
distinguished
friends
who
contributed
so
much
to
his
pleasure
and
his
growth
about
this
period
the
moribund
chamber
of
the
eglantine
was
merged
into
coster
academy
which
now
became
the
theatre
of
the
city
shortly
afterwards
vondel
wrote
his
verses
of
welcome
to
hugo
grotius
upon
his
return
from
exile
verses
full
of
severe
condemnation
of
the
party
that
had
banished
him
then
followed
a
song
of
triumph
for
the
naval
victories
over
the
spaniards
and
several
satires
against
the
clergy
who
were
again
fomenting
restrictive
measures
against
the
freedom
of
conscience
all
of
these
productions
glowed
with
the
fierce
jealousy
for
personal
liberty
which
had
become
the
poet
ruling
passion
for
his
verse
ever
gave
utterance
to
his
dominant
emotion
in
his
own
words
i
needs
must
sing
the
song
that
fills
my
heart
his
funeral
sacrifice
of
magdeburg
alone
was
free
from
this
contentious
spirit
this
was
a
heroic
poem
in
praise
of
gustavus
adolphus
the
bulwark
of
protestantism
and
his
splendid
victory
over
tilly
and
pappenheim
at
leipsic
that
terrible
vengeance
for
the
fearful
sacking
of
magdeburg
in
the
beginning
of
the
illustrious
atheneum
of
amsterdam
was
opened
with
imposing
ceremonies
to
which
occasion
vondel
contributed
an
excellent
poem
not
long
afterwards
grotius
on
account
of
his
too
open
opposition
to
his
old
enemies
was
again
banished
from
his
fatherland
a
price
of
two
thousand
guldens
was
set
on
his
head
which
gave
vondel
cause
for
another
trenchant
pasquinade
he
did
not
however
dare
to
publish
this
for
fear
of
calling
upon
himself
the
same
violence
that
his
friend
had
escaped
grotius
himself
wrote
vondel
a
letter
of
thanks
for
his
interest
in
his
behalf
adding
that
it
could
do
no
possible
good
to
publish
the
poem
and
that
it
would
therefore
be
unwise
for
him
to
put
himself
into
danger
an
elegy
on
the
death
of
count
ernest
casimir
and
an
ode
on
the
triumph
of
maastricht
saw
the
light
however
and
were
much
admired
by
all
parties
of
his
countrymen
vondel
now
began
his
great
epic
constantine
this
poem
had
for
its
subject
the
journey
of
constantine
to
rome
and
was
intended
to
be
complete
in
twelve
books
after
the
model
of
virgil
æneid
the
poet
had
for
several
years
been
preparing
himself
for
this
immense
undertaking
by
a
thorough
study
not
only
of
the
great
epics
of
antiquity
but
also
of
those
of
tasso
and
ariosto
besides
reading
the
various
church
fathers
and
the
historians
who
had
written
on
this
period
he
also
entered
into
a
correspondence
concerning
the
subject
with
grotius
who
was
much
pleased
to
hear
of
his
plan
and
who
also
gave
him
considerable
information
while
vondel
was
busy
with
his
epic
his
wife
bore
him
a
son
whom
in
honor
of
his
hero
he
named
constantine
the
child
died
however
and
not
long
afterwards
the
mother
also
this
terrible
affliction
cast
a
gloom
over
the
life
of
the
poet
from
which
he
never
entirely
emerged
full
of
pathos
is
his
letter
to
grotius
stating
his
loneliness
and
adding
that
all
his
interest
in
his
epic
had
departed
since
the
death
of
my
sainted
wife
i
have
lost
heart
so
that
i
shall
have
to
give
up
my
great
for
the
present
the
poet
was
never
able
to
resume
this
stupendous
work
it
was
too
suggestive
of
memories
of
a
happiness
forever
lost
after
keeping
the
manuscript
by
him
for
several
years
with
the
vain
hope
that
his
interest
might
be
reanimated
he
at
last
destroyed
it
it
was
thus
that
dutch
literature
lost
its
greatest
epic
a
poem
which
would
doubtless
have
added
to
the
renown
of
the
author
and
reflected
lustre
upon
his
country
in
grotius
who
was
now
the
swedish
ambassador
to
france
published
his
latin
tragedy
sophompaneas
of
which
joseph
was
the
hero
vondel
who
was
still
in
his
shop
in
the
warmoesstraat
having
laid
the
constantine
aside
and
wishing
to
employ
his
leisure
time
made
a
dutch
rendering
of
this
play
of
which
the
author
wrote
vossius
as
follows
i
understand
that
vondel
hath
done
me
the
honor
to
put
my
with
his
own
hand
that
is
to
say
in
his
artistic
manner
into
our
holland
tongue
i
am
under
great
obligations
to
him
because
he
who
is
capable
of
so
much
better
things
than
i
hath
now
in
his
translation
of
my
play
given
his
labor
as
a
proof
of
his
friendship
vondel
in
translating
often
sought
the
advice
of
his
friends
saying
each
judgment
views
the
matter
in
a
different
light
and
the
judgment
of
one
is
poor
beside
the
opinions
of
many
he
also
said
that
he
found
the
work
of
translating
serviceable
to
gain
a
knowledge
of
the
technique
diction
thought
and
peculiarity
of
an
author
moreover
he
discovered
that
it
not
only
kindled
his
imagination
but
that
it
also
suggested
new
thought
and
was
conducive
to
his
own
improvement
in
language
and
in
form
for
this
reason
he
translated
so
many
of
the
classics
of
which
more
will
be
said
at
the
proper
time
the
academy
having
become
too
small
for
the
public
that
now
thronged
to
the
theatre
coster
sold
the
building
to
the
regents
of
the
orphan
asylum
and
of
the
old
men
home
the
managers
of
these
charitable
institutions
then
as
an
investment
built
a
new
theatre
in
its
place
here
twice
a
week
plays
were
presented
with
great
profit
to
the
management
the
new
theatre
was
completed
in
and
the
first
drama
played
on
its
stage
was
vondel
fine
tragedy
gysbrecht
van
amstel
this
play
had
as
its
subject
the
defeat
of
the
old
hero
sir
gysbrecht
and
his
banishment
from
his
native
city
amsterdam
soon
after
the
death
of
floris
this
historical
event
was
supposed
to
have
occurred
about
christmastide
and
the
drama
was
accordingly
presented
on
new
year
eve
the
gysbrecht
is
the
most
popular
of
all
of
vondel
plays
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
from
the
night
of
its
first
presentation
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
until
the
present
time
it
has
been
presented
every
new
year
eve
on
the
stage
of
the
theatre
of
amsterdam
some
of
the
situations
in
this
drama
are
based
upon
various
episodes
in
virgil
æneid
one
of
the
characters
also
is
made
to
prophesy
the
future
glory
of
the
city
which
moreover
may
easily
be
interpreted
as
prophetic
of
the
grandeur
of
the
greater
new
amsterdam
beyond
the
sea
a
circumstance
that
should
give
it
additional
interest
to
americans
the
gysbrecht
was
dedicated
to
grotius
who
acknowledged
the
honor
as
follows
sir
i
hold
myself
much
beholden
to
you
for
your
courtesy
and
your
great
kindness
to
me
for
you
almost
alone
at
least
there
are
but
few
besides
you
in
the
netherlands
seek
to
relieve
my
gloom
and
to
reward
my
unrewarded
services
i
have
always
held
your
talents
and
your
works
in
the
highest
esteem
he
then
goes
on
to
speak
of
the
charming
proportions
of
the
play
and
of
the
verses
pithy
tender
and
flowing
then
he
continues
the
coloneus
of
sophocles
and
the
of
euripides
have
not
honored
athens
more
than
thou
hast
amsterdam
to
vossius
at
leiden
grotius
also
wrote
in
a
no
less
complimentary
strain
concerning
this
production
we
had
the
privilege
of
seeing
this
drama
on
the
stage
in
amsterdam
one
new
year
eve
a
couple
of
years
ago
and
we
confess
that
it
was
not
until
we
heard
the
magnificent
recitative
of
the
superb
bouwmeester
the
great
tragedian
of
holland
in
this
beautiful
play
that
we
fully
appreciated
the
grandeur
and
the
sublimity
of
vondel
and
the
power
and
the
sweetness
of
the
dutch
language
part
of
the
roman
ceremonial
with
its
splendid
ritual
is
introduced
into
one
of
the
scenes
of
the
gysbrecht
and
this
has
been
taken
as
foreshadowing
vondel
conversion
to
catholicism
naturally
this
gave
offence
to
many
of
the
bigots
among
the
calvinists
who
saw
in
it
only
the
glorification
of
popery
vondel
then
wrote
a
tragedy
messalina
which
however
he
destroyed
because
some
of
the
actors
while
rehearsing
their
parts
through
some
adventitious
remark
of
the
poet
had
inferred
that
the
play
possessed
a
certain
political
significance
and
that
it
was
an
allegory
picturing
forth
some
of
the
notables
of
the
day
after
the
manner
of
the
palamedes
the
poet
fearing
that
it
might
breed
mischief
and
seeing
that
it
was
impossible
to
rectify
the
matter
since
it
had
already
become
a
subject
of
conversation
among
the
actors
begged
the
parts
of
the
three
leading
pretending
that
he
wished
to
make
some
important
corrections
having
obtained
possession
of
these
parts
he
took
good
care
to
burn
them
thus
preventing
the
presentation
of
the
play
and
putting
a
stop
to
the
silly
chatter
of
the
players
rome
his
next
undertaking
was
the
translation
of
the
electra
of
sophocles
being
aided
in
the
work
by
isaac
vossius
a
son
of
the
celebrated
leyden
professor
who
was
himself
also
a
profound
scholar
as
was
usual
with
this
poet
the
translation
of
this
tragedy
was
followed
by
one
of
his
own
the
drama
of
the
virgins
or
saint
ursula
this
he
dedicated
to
the
city
of
his
birth
cologne
where
the
legend
says
a
british
princess
with
eleven
thousand
other
maidens
at
the
command
of
attila
the
ferocious
hun
suffered
a
martyr
death
this
tragedy
also
received
the
praises
of
grotius
and
it
may
safely
be
said
that
no
man
of
his
time
with
the
possible
exception
of
john
milton
was
so
capable
of
judging
according
to
the
rigid
rules
of
the
antique
as
grotius
for
besides
being
the
most
learned
man
of
his
age
an
accomplished
grecian
and
an
unsurpassed
latinist
he
was
himself
a
poet
of
no
mean
order
the
virgins
notwithstanding
its
beauty
and
tenderness
was
the
cause
of
much
sorrow
to
the
friends
of
vondel
in
that
it
unmistakably
showed
the
poet
inclination
towards
romanism
true
as
has
been
narrated
this
had
for
some
years
been
suspected
from
the
tone
of
several
other
productions
that
preceded
it
but
then
it
was
only
a
suspicion
now
there
was
no
longer
a
doubt
vondel
was
plainly
on
the
high
road
to
rome
and
it
was
whispered
that
he
having
become
tired
of
his
loneliness
had
been
attracted
by
a
certain
catholic
widow
whose
seductive
charms
were
largely
responsible
for
his
wavering
faith
the
widow
here
referred
to
is
supposed
to
have
been
the
fair
tesselschade
the
friend
of
his
youth
who
after
ten
years
of
wedded
bliss
had
at
one
stroke
been
deprived
of
both
her
eldest
child
and
her
husband
and
was
now
living
with
her
one
remaining
child
a
daughter
in
resigned
widowhood
at
alkmaar
we
are
now
again
to
see
this
remarkable
woman
as
the
inspirer
of
the
muse
of
holland
barlæus
in
his
tessalica
wooed
her
in
elegant
latin
and
vondel
dedicated
to
her
his
translation
of
the
electra
of
sophocles
and
also
his
next
biblical
tragedy
peter
and
paul
which
was
even
more
decided
in
its
romanism
than
its
predecessor
tesselschade
however
preferred
her
black
widow
weeds
to
the
white
raiment
of
a
bride
and
continued
in
her
retirement
alone
with
the
memory
of
her
happy
past
her
spirit
shone
only
the
brighter
in
its
progress
through
the
valley
of
tribulation
to
the
heights
of
resignation
she
had
been
chastened
by
affliction
and
saddened
by
sorrow
yet
she
did
not
lose
heart
but
still
enjoyed
the
society
of
her
friends
she
still
took
an
admirable
part
in
the
drama
of
life
in
the
french
queen
dowager
maria
de
medici
paid
a
short
visit
to
amsterdam
tesselschade
not
only
sang
a
song
before
her
but
also
presented
her
with
an
italian
poem
of
her
own
composition
she
had
finished
her
version
of
the
gerusalemme
and
was
now
busy
translating
the
adonis
of
marini
the
young
poets
vos
and
brandt
the
poetess
alida
bruno
and
others
of
the
rising
literati
sought
her
friendship
tesselschade
was
still
the
queen
when
the
muses
went
and
her
sovereignty
remained
undisputed
until
the
day
of
her
death
in
appeared
vondel
biblical
tragedy
the
brothers
which
was
thought
by
the
critics
to
surpass
all
that
had
preceded
it
it
was
dedicated
to
vossius
whose
comment
upon
reading
it
was
grotius
wrote
the
poet
a
letter
and
was
also
loud
in
his
praises
comparing
it
with
the
most
famous
tragedies
of
antiquity
adding
significantly
and
do
not
forget
your
great
epic
by
others
this
drama
was
thought
to
combine
the
tenderness
of
euripides
with
the
sublimity
of
sophocles
in
the
same
year
also
followed
two
more
biblical
tragedies
joseph
in
dothan
and
joseph
in
egypt
which
also
occasioned
much
remark
and
were
not
inferior
to
the
best
plays
that
had
gone
before
vondel
was
now
universally
acknowledged
to
be
the
greatest
poet
of
the
time
the
ascent
of
parnassus
however
is
not
as
easy
as
the
by
years
of
study
constant
watchfulness
and
perpetual
striving
for
and
a
prayerful
devotion
to
his
art
thus
alone
did
he
attain
the
summit
of
such
achievement
in
him
was
seen
purity
of
diction
clearness
and
terseness
of
expression
power
of
logic
richness
and
agreeableness
of
invention
and
a
style
that
was
at
once
mellifluous
and
sublime
the
tragedy
peter
and
paul
to
whose
open
romanism
reference
has
already
been
made
was
his
next
effort
and
was
soon
followed
by
the
epistles
of
the
holy
virgin
martyrs
which
were
twelve
in
number
and
were
dedicated
to
the
holy
virgin
mary
whom
he
called
the
queen
of
heaven
and
named
as
mediator
with
her
divine
son
this
was
a
sufficient
acknowledgment
of
his
conversion
to
the
catholic
faith
to
alienate
many
of
his
warmest
friends
this
however
though
it
must
have
brought
much
grief
to
his
sensitive
heart
did
not
cause
him
to
regret
having
made
a
step
that
he
had
so
long
been
meditating
before
beginning
these
epistles
vondel
had
translated
many
of
the
epistles
of
ovid
that
he
might
absorb
the
grace
and
the
spirit
of
ovid
epistolary
style
his
own
effort
was
deemed
not
less
graceful
and
spirited
their
literary
merit
however
did
not
in
the
estimation
of
his
protestant
friends
compensate
for
their
justification
of
popery
even
hooft
vondel
friend
and
brother
in
art
grew
cold
and
we
find
the
following
reference
to
this
in
one
of
the
poet
letters
to
the
judge
of
muiden
vondel
writes
i
wish
cornelius
tacitus
a
happy
and
a
blessed
new
year
and
although
he
forbids
me
a
harmless
at
his
heretical
table
yet
i
shall
nevertheless
occasionally
read
another
for
him
that
he
may
die
as
devout
a
catholic
as
he
now
shows
himself
an
ardent
partisan
their
friendship
was
yet
further
broken
by
other
circumstances
which
had
their
origin
in
the
first
cause
of
separation
in
vondel
wrote
a
lyric
poem
on
a
miracle
which
the
catholics
taught
had
occurred
at
amsterdam
about
the
middle
of
the
fourteenth
century
this
was
too
much
for
his
protestant
friends
and
he
became
the
subject
of
innumerable
lame
lampoons
and
petty
pasquinades
in
which
his
espousal
of
the
catholic
legend
was
coarsely
ridiculed
hooft
in
a
letter
to
professor
barlæus
also
expressed
his
opinion
in
the
following
words
vondel
seems
to
grow
tired
of
nothing
sooner
than
of
rest
it
seems
he
must
have
saved
up
three
hundred
guldens
more
which
are
causing
him
a
good
deal
of
embarrassment
and
i
do
not
know
but
that
it
might
cost
him
even
much
dearer
than
this
for
some
might
be
tempted
prematurely
to
lay
violent
hands
upon
him
thinking
that
not
even
a
cock
would
crow
his
regret
these
productions
however
were
only
the
prelude
to
a
greater
work
that
was
to
follow
his
mysteries
of
the
altar
which
was
published
in
the
autumn
of
this
poem
was
a
glorification
of
the
mass
and
was
divided
into
three
books
vondel
in
writing
this
able
work
was
assisted
by
the
counsel
of
the
most
learned
and
the
most
profound
men
in
the
catholic
church
the
doctrines
of
thomas
aquinas
and
other
celebrated
schoolmen
and
the
teachings
of
the
best
modern
authorities
were
here
poetically
combined
and
the
poet
was
hailed
on
every
side
as
the
ablest
defender
of
the
tenets
of
the
church
of
rome
this
poem
provoked
a
celebrated
reply
by
jacob
westerbaen
one
of
the
most
noted
of
the
school
of
dort
who
while
praising
the
art
of
the
new
champion
of
catholicism
at
the
same
time
attacked
his
doctrinal
position
with
such
piercing
analysis
and
with
so
great
display
of
theological
dogma
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
protestants
vondel
was
ingloriously
vanquished
the
catholics
of
course
thought
differently
jacob
archbishop
of
mechlin
to
whom
vondel
poem
was
dedicated
sent
the
author
a
painting
with
which
vondel
was
at
first
greatly
pleased
learning
however
that
it
was
only
a
bad
copy
he
gave
it
away
to
his
sister
no
longer
wishing
to
have
such
a
poor
reward
for
so
great
an
undertaking
before
his
eyes
a
prose
translation
of
the
works
of
virgil
was
the
next
thing
that
this
indefatigable
worker
essayed
this
version
received
the
commendation
of
most
of
his
contemporaries
barlæus
indeed
found
fault
with
it
saying
that
it
was
without
life
and
marrow
adding
cynically
that
augustus
would
surely
not
have
withheld
this
maro
from
the
flames
but
then
barlæus
was
such
a
thorough
latinist
that
his
own
language
seemed
foreign
to
him
he
would
have
had
the
translator
preserve
the
peculiarities
of
the
latin
at
the
expense
of
his
native
tongue
and
then
was
he
not
also
vondel
rival
for
the
hand
of
tesselschade
praise
from
him
surely
was
not
to
be
expected
the
universal
opinion
was
that
it
was
a
difficult
work
excellently
done
this
translation
was
also
the
forerunner
of
a
drama
maria
stuart
was
the
name
of
the
tragedy
which
the
bard
now
offered
for
the
perusal
of
his
countrymen
the
poet
represented
the
unhappy
queen
of
scots
as
perfect
and
without
stain
while
her
victorious
rival
elizabeth
was
painted
in
infernal
black
this
subject
naturally
gave
the
proselyte
occasion
to
display
his
burning
zeal
for
rome
and
upon
the
publication
of
the
play
a
great
outcry
was
raised
against
both
drama
and
author
some
of
enemies
indeed
were
so
incensed
and
raised
such
a
commotion
that
the
poet
was
brought
before
the
city
tribunal
and
fined
one
hundred
and
eighty
guldens
which
says
brandt
vondel
biographer
seemed
indeed
strange
to
many
seeing
what
freedom
in
writing
was
allowed
at
this
time
and
because
also
even
to
the
poets
of
antiquity
more
was
permitted
than
to
most
others
abraham
de
wees
vondel
publisher
however
paid
the
fine
being
unwilling
that
the
poet
should
suffer
by
that
which
brought
him
profit
hugo
grotius
was
now
dead
but
shortly
before
his
decease
he
had
written
several
pamphlets
whose
object
it
was
to
effect
some
reconciliation
between
catholic
and
protestant
vondel
now
translated
those
portions
of
these
favorable
to
the
papacy
combining
them
in
a
polemic
called
grotius
testament
whereupon
many
said
that
he
had
now
gone
too
far
in
his
zeal
for
his
adopted
church
for
it
was
claimed
that
upon
the
statements
of
grotius
he
often
put
a
construction
not
favored
by
the
context
it
was
even
insinuated
by
some
that
he
had
not
acted
in
good
faith
brandt
himself
made
this
intimation
in
a
preface
written
by
him
to
an
edition
of
vondel
collected
works
which
was
published
in
the
year
brandt
was
then
yet
a
mere
youth
and
was
rankling
with
the
memory
of
a
severe
and
unjust
reprimand
that
the
older
poet
some
time
before
had
given
him
he
therefore
acknowledges
in
his
naïve
biography
that
he
eagerly
welcomed
this
opportunity
to
be
revenged
upon
the
distinguished
offender
and
accordingly
made
this
dose
of
his
gall
as
bitter
as
possible
the
poet
felt
the
insinuation
keenly
and
for
a
long
time
suspected
peter
de
groot
the
son
of
the
great
lawyer
as
the
perpetrator
of
the
offending
paragraph
many
years
afterwards
however
the
smart
of
the
wound
having
departed
the
real
culprit
confessed
his
sin
to
the
then
aged
poet
and
obtained
the
asked
for
absolution
it
was
in
that
vondel
openly
embraced
the
catholic
faith
though
his
tendency
in
that
direction
had
been
apparent
in
his
poems
many
years
before
we
have
already
referred
to
the
report
that
his
love
for
a
beautiful
and
wealthy
widow
tesselschade
had
been
the
main
instrument
in
drawing
him
from
his
protestant
moorings
and
this
was
doubtless
to
some
extent
true
and
yet
it
is
almost
certain
that
vondel
would
have
embraced
the
cause
of
rome
even
without
the
alluring
wiles
of
this
fair
enchantress
many
of
his
relatives
including
his
brother
william
belonged
to
that
faith
many
of
his
dearest
friends
also
were
of
that
denomination
his
daughter
anna
furthermore
had
not
only
entered
that
church
but
had
also
taken
the
veil
moreover
he
had
long
been
drifting
away
from
the
creed
of
his
early
childhood
the
anabaptism
of
his
parents
the
severe
pietism
of
that
belief
had
never
strongly
appealed
to
him
true
he
had
espoused
the
cause
of
the
arminians
as
against
their
enemies
the
gomarists
but
it
was
only
because
they
were
the
under
side
and
because
their
cause
was
also
the
cause
of
civil
liberty
that
he
had
entered
the
lists
with
them
the
perpetual
discord
the
disunion
the
bickerings
the
bitterness
and
the
persecutions
among
the
different
protestant
sects
of
the
period
were
exceedingly
repulsive
to
him
he
did
not
forget
that
under
the
banner
of
protestantism
his
country
had
triumphed
over
the
common
foe
he
did
not
forget
that
calvin
had
been
the
herald
of
science
and
the
apostle
of
liberty
he
did
not
fail
to
remember
the
glories
of
the
past
but
the
contemplation
of
that
proud
past
only
increased
his
abhorrence
of
the
petty
present
calvinism
had
indeed
done
much
for
holland
but
the
inevitable
reaction
had
come
and
its
excesses
could
not
be
justified
calvinism
had
come
to
mean
dogma
and
dogma
had
no
attraction
for
his
poetic
mind
calvinism
had
become
the
foe
of
freedom
and
freedom
was
the
very
breath
of
this
flaming
patriot
calvinism
had
shown
itself
an
enemy
of
the
arts
of
poetry
and
of
the
drama
and
these
were
as
the
very
soul
of
vondel
how
could
he
know
that
this
was
only
a
fleeting
gloom
from
which
the
sun
of
calvinism
would
again
emerge
radiant
with
all
of
its
original
glory
he
was
weary
weary
of
the
discord
and
longed
for
peace
is
it
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
poet
gradually
drifted
even
as
cardinal
newman
into
a
haven
that
promised
such
rest
is
it
surprising
that
he
who
had
so
long
been
chilled
by
the
cold
formalism
and
the
frigid
austerity
of
the
dogma
of
the
north
should
now
find
it
agreeable
to
thaw
out
his
soul
in
the
glow
of
the
religion
of
the
south
then
too
the
beauty
of
the
catholic
ritual
the
pomp
the
grand
processional
the
holy
days
the
glorious
music
the
noble
symmetry
of
the
roman
architecture
the
antiquity
of
the
church
the
magnificence
of
its
domain
the
splendor
of
its
organization
allured
the
imagination
of
the
poet
with
irresistible
power
and
his
reason
followed
a
not
unwilling
captive
nor
was
it
the
hasty
choice
of
a
regretted
impulse
everything
tends
to
show
we
have
traced
the
gradual
growth
in
his
poems
that
it
was
a
step
from
which
once
taken
nothing
should
ever
be
able
to
remove
him
it
is
therefore
in
vondel
that
we
find
one
of
the
most
able
and
ardent
champions
the
church
of
rome
has
ever
had
no
saint
ever
more
truly
deserved
canonization
than
this
high
priest
of
apollo
flaming
with
zeal
for
his
adopted
faith
vondel
was
a
crusader
born
five
hundred
years
too
late
a
crusader
too
a
defender
of
the
cross
most
of
whose
battles
were
fought
beneath
the
brow
of
mount
zion
and
within
the
very
gates
of
jerusalem
few
crusaders
indeed
had
fought
so
long
and
so
well
few
had
won
so
many
victories
had
slain
so
many
enemies
as
this
indomitable
hero
of
amsterdam
though
bitterly
opposed
to
the
he
however
helped
them
in
decrying
the
growing
spirit
of
ostentation
and
the
vices
of
the
day
and
although
he
openly
sided
with
the
remonstrants
he
never
joined
them
but
as
a
flower
turns
its
head
to
the
sun
so
he
too
gradually
turned
towards
the
old
belief
at
this
period
when
protestants
were
in
turn
persecuting
heretics
and
reveling
in
their
sudden
freedom
were
indulging
in
all
sorts
of
fanatical
excesses
catholicism
purified
began
to
live
again
furthermore
to
the
poetic
temperament
of
the
poet
and
his
stern
sense
of
justice
the
bigotry
of
the
gomarists
seemed
no
less
odious
than
the
more
open
persecutions
of
the
catholics
of
the
preceding
age
it
was
thus
that
vondel
long
tossed
upon
a
sea
of
doubt
sought
anchorage
in
a
harbor
where
winds
were
calm
it
was
thus
that
this
great
man
was
led
to
take
a
step
which
called
down
upon
him
for
many
years
hate
aversion
and
ridicule
but
in
spite
of
all
this
he
remained
true
to
his
new
faith
and
became
a
fervid
catholic
one
ever
consistent
and
true
to
his
adopted
church
here
he
could
remain
undisturbed
in
his
reverence
for
antiquity
in
his
worship
of
beauty
and
in
his
love
for
poetry
and
art
here
there
was
ever
a
labyrinth
of
mystery
for
his
aspiring
soul
to
explore
here
the
plan
of
salvation
was
not
reduced
to
the
bare
expression
of
a
logical
formula
upward
and
onward
but
we
must
again
make
brief
reference
to
the
friends
of
our
poet
who
one
by
one
preceded
him
to
the
grave
first
reael
died
then
hooft
and
barlæus
soon
followed
and
were
both
buried
in
the
new
church
at
amsterdam
above
the
tomb
of
each
vondel
wrote
a
short
epitaph
but
the
keenest
loss
was
yet
to
come
in
holland
lost
the
brightest
jewel
in
the
crown
of
her
womanhood
and
vondel
his
dearest
friend
tesselschade
after
many
sorrows
entered
peacefully
into
rest
a
few
years
before
she
had
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
her
left
eye
from
a
spark
that
flew
out
of
a
smithy
as
she
passed
she
bore
this
sad
accident
with
cheerfulness
but
a
greater
calamity
yet
awaited
her
the
pride
of
her
heart
her
one
remaining
child
her
beautiful
daughter
tesselschade
was
suddenly
cut
off
in
the
bloom
of
maidenhood
the
disconsolate
mother
struggled
in
vain
against
this
terrible
sorrow
a
year
later
she
followed
her
loved
ones
to
the
tomb
she
also
was
laid
away
in
the
new
church
by
the
side
of
the
dead
titans
of
her
generation
who
had
so
often
made
her
the
theme
of
their
inspired
song
where
too
vondel
himself
the
greatest
of
them
all
was
eventually
to
lie
for
vondel
beautiful
threnody
we
have
unfortunately
no
space
but
shall
content
ourselves
with
quoting
the
first
strophe
of
touching
elegy
here
tesselschade
lies
let
no
one
rashly
dare
to
give
the
measure
of
her
worth
beyond
compare
her
glory
like
the
sun
the
poet
pen
defies
shortly
after
the
death
of
his
dear
friend
vondel
gave
up
his
hosiery
shop
in
the
warmoesstraat
to
his
son
while
he
himself
went
to
live
with
his
daughter
anna
on
the
cingel
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city
the
poet
was
now
years
of
age
and
he
doubtless
thought
to
end
his
days
in
peace
and
studious
retirement
but
the
battle
of
life
for
him
had
only
just
begun
he
was
never
to
know
the
meaning
of
rest
about
this
time
vondel
again
had
occasion
for
his
tremendous
invective
we
refer
to
his
remarkable
series
of
satires
against
the
of
great
britain
his
odes
on
the
regicides
of
england
charles
stuart
murdered
majesty
protector
werewolf
cromwell
the
flag
of
scotland
and
many
other
poems
on
the
same
subject
breathe
the
very
spirit
of
war
and
glow
with
the
same
intense
indignation
and
righteous
wrath
that
characterize
the
productions
of
john
milton
on
the
other
side
these
fierce
polemics
winged
with
rime
were
very
popular
in
holland
where
the
cause
of
the
royalists
was
favored
but
it
was
the
catholic
no
less
than
the
royalist
who
spoke
in
these
seething
satires
that
vondel
the
republican
should
assume
such
a
fierce
attitude
against
the
republicans
of
england
can
only
be
explained
by
his
fear
that
in
england
even
as
in
holland
canting
bigotry
would
now
usurp
the
altars
of
religion
and
there
with
unholy
zeal
sacrifice
the
soul
of
art
and
the
spirit
of
liberty
or
was
it
an
intuitive
dread
of
a
republican
and
puritan
england
that
made
the
hollander
seize
these
firebrands
from
his
kindling
wrath
it
may
be
for
the
commonwealth
was
not
at
all
friendly
towards
her
sister
republic
and
ere
long
the
protector
dealt
the
naval
supremacy
of
the
dutch
a
blow
from
which
they
never
recovered
in
vondel
celebrated
the
treaty
of
munster
by
his
leeuwendalers
a
pastoral
drama
in
the
style
of
guarini
pastor
fido
and
more
charming
pastoral
surely
never
was
written
with
not
one
note
of
strife
not
one
strident
trumpet
blast
to
jar
upon
its
harmony
the
leeuwendalers
is
a
fitting
monument
to
the
heroism
of
the
patriots
whose
magnificent
struggle
of
years
against
the
overwhelming
tyranny
of
spain
had
at
last
been
rewarded
by
this
glorious
peace
not
long
afterwards
he
wrote
his
excellent
epitaph
on
that
brave
old
martin
tromp
save
among
the
clergy
vondel
romanism
seemed
now
no
longer
to
cause
much
comment
the
tragedy
of
solomon
vondel
following
drama
was
remarkable
for
its
opulence
at
this
time
also
his
fiery
denunciation
of
the
stadtholder
william
ii
and
his
party
for
their
attack
upon
and
their
unsuccessful
attempt
against
the
ancient
privileges
of
amsterdam
did
much
to
reestablish
him
in
the
good
graces
of
his
fellow
citizens
the
summit
on
october
one
hundred
leading
painters
poets
architects
and
sculptors
of
the
city
of
amsterdam
known
as
the
guild
of
luke
assembled
in
the
hall
of
the
order
for
their
anniversary
celebration
this
was
the
historic
feast
of
luke
and
vondel
was
the
honored
guest
of
the
occasion
the
poet
was
placed
at
one
end
of
the
table
on
a
high
chair
which
was
to
represent
a
throne
here
he
was
crowned
with
laurel
as
the
symposiarch
or
king
of
the
feast
it
is
said
by
the
great
painter
bartholomew
van
der
helst
thus
apollo
and
apelles
were
happily
united
in
the
bond
of
a
common
sympathy
and
all
petty
dissensions
were
forgotten
in
the
triumph
of
art
poems
were
read
toasts
were
made
the
ceremonies
as
is
usual
at
all
the
feasts
of
the
hollanders
closing
with
their
national
anthem
the
grand
wilhelmus
the
most
affecting
and
sublime
of
all
national
odes
calling
up
as
it
does
memories
of
a
hundred
years
of
martyrdom
and
of
the
heroic
founder
of
the
republic
it
was
the
proudest
moment
of
the
poet
life
and
we
can
imagine
the
depth
of
his
emotion
as
the
glorious
laurel
graced
his
brow
perhaps
too
the
romantic
face
of
rembrandt
was
near
by
drinking
in
with
his
thirsty
eyes
the
picturesque
beauty
of
the
scene
unconscious
of
the
crown
which
fickle
destiny
had
reserved
for
him
or
it
may
be
that
the
thoughtful
youth
spinoza
silent
and
abstemious
found
there
some
theme
for
his
revolutionary
philosophy
yet
vondel
was
king
of
them
all
crowned
with
a
kingship
won
by
prodigies
of
valor
on
the
of
life
every
leaf
in
that
laurel
wreath
was
purchased
by
a
thorn
but
who
thinks
of
the
sharpness
of
the
thorn
when
caressed
by
the
velvet
of
the
leaf
so
vondel
in
that
moment
of
triumph
forgot
his
sorrows
in
his
cup
of
joy
as
he
drained
the
sweet
present
to
the
dregs
in
return
for
the
honor
it
had
done
him
vondel
dedicated
his
prose
translation
of
the
odes
of
horace
to
the
hospitable
guild
he
was
now
years
old
and
was
yet
in
the
possession
of
every
bodily
and
mental
power
he
was
now
to
give
forth
his
masterpiece
a
work
for
which
his
whole
life
had
been
a
constant
preparation
we
come
to
the
lucifer
this
tragedy
appeared
in
and
was
the
monumental
creation
of
this
combatant
poet
the
crystallization
of
the
titanic
passions
of
the
age
it
has
therefore
a
significance
that
can
never
fade
on
account
of
the
character
of
the
play
which
naturally
treats
of
holy
subject
matter
the
clergy
at
once
gave
it
the
benefit
of
their
most
strenuous
opposition
saying
that
it
was
full
of
unholy
unchaste
idolatrous
false
and
utterly
depraved
things
through
their
meddlesome
interference
the
lucifer
after
it
had
twice
been
presented
on
the
stage
was
interdicted
as
a
matter
of
course
this
caused
it
to
be
the
subject
of
much
comment
and
the
first
edition
of
one
thousand
was
sold
in
a
week
petrus
wittewrongel
a
native
of
zealand
was
the
most
conspicuous
among
the
opponents
of
this
play
his
opposition
however
extended
to
the
drama
in
general
making
it
the
theme
of
every
sermon
according
to
this
dutch
puritan
the
theatre
was
a
school
of
idleness
a
mount
of
idolatry
a
relic
of
paganism
leading
to
sin
godlessness
impurity
and
frivolity
a
mere
waste
of
time
this
bitter
attack
on
his
beloved
art
gave
the
occasion
for
vondel
famous
vindication
of
the
drama
in
his
proem
to
the
lucifer
he
also
wrote
two
biting
satirical
poems
the
passing
of
orpheus
and
the
rivalry
of
apollo
and
pan
both
of
which
were
full
of
humorous
raillery
and
of
sarcastic
allusions
to
the
in
general
and
to
wittewrongel
in
particular
the
force
of
the
lucifer
as
a
picture
of
the
age
of
the
nation
and
of
the
world
was
instantly
felt
it
was
a
classic
from
the
day
of
its
birth
and
from
that
time
to
this
it
has
easily
maintained
its
position
as
the
grandest
poem
of
the
language
the
costly
and
artistic
scenic
heavens
especially
prepared
for
the
lucifer
were
now
that
the
play
was
forbidden
stored
away
as
useless
a
great
loss
to
the
managers
of
the
theatre
vondel
accordingly
wrote
his
excellent
tragedy
salmoneus
founded
upon
the
classic
story
of
the
king
of
elis
in
which
this
scene
as
an
imitated
heaven
could
also
be
used
his
psalms
of
david
in
various
metres
was
his
next
venture
these
he
dedicated
to
queen
christina
of
sweden
who
like
the
poet
himself
was
a
proselyte
to
the
catholic
faith
he
also
honored
her
with
a
panegyric
in
return
for
which
the
queen
sent
him
a
golden
locket
and
chain
in
we
find
the
poet
making
another
journey
to
denmark
where
he
went
to
fulfil
the
unpleasant
duty
of
paying
his
son
debts
in
denmark
he
was
the
recipient
of
considerable
attention
and
while
there
his
portrait
was
painted
by
the
celebrated
dutch
artist
karl
van
mander
who
was
painter
to
the
danish
court
the
shadows
soon
after
his
return
to
amsterdam
the
great
poet
who
had
celebrated
so
many
distinguished
personages
and
who
had
become
the
pride
of
his
nation
was
by
the
bankruptcy
of
his
profligate
son
brought
to
the
very
verge
of
poverty
besides
the
little
constantine
whose
early
death
we
have
elsewhere
recorded
the
poet
had
three
children
one
son
justus
and
two
daughters
sarah
and
anna
sarah
died
in
childhood
and
anna
who
was
said
to
resemble
her
father
both
in
intellect
and
in
appearance
lived
with
him
and
was
ever
a
loving
and
devoted
daughter
the
son
joost
was
both
stupid
and
dissolute
his
ignorance
was
so
great
that
when
some
one
spoke
of
his
father
tragedy
joseph
in
egypt
he
inquired
if
joseph
was
not
also
a
catholic
during
the
life
of
his
first
wife
a
woman
of
some
force
this
unworthy
son
of
a
distinguished
sire
kept
within
due
bounds
shortly
after
her
death
however
he
was
united
to
a
shallow
spendthrift
with
whom
he
wasted
his
substance
in
riotous
living
while
the
shop
of
course
was
neglected
and
the
business
in
consequence
soon
ruined
at
this
the
old
man
was
so
grieved
that
with
his
daughter
who
was
yet
with
him
he
moved
away
to
another
part
of
the
city
here
he
was
many
times
heard
to
say
had
i
not
the
comfort
and
the
quickening
of
the
psalms
of
which
at
that
time
he
was
making
his
version
i
should
die
in
my
misery
he
often
also
said
to
his
friends
name
no
child
by
your
own
name
for
if
he
should
not
turn
out
well
it
is
forever
branded
in
the
meantime
the
son
went
from
bad
to
worse
he
squandered
not
only
all
of
his
own
property
but
also
much
that
had
been
intrusted
into
his
hands
by
others
he
stood
on
the
point
of
bankruptcy
with
the
penalty
of
imprisonment
staring
him
in
the
face
when
his
father
with
a
keen
sense
of
honor
and
of
family
pride
satisfied
all
creditors
by
the
sacrifice
of
his
own
snug
little
fortune
of
forty
thousand
guldens
the
savings
of
half
a
century
friends
of
the
family
advised
the
erring
son
to
go
to
the
dutch
colonies
in
the
east
indies
there
to
begin
life
anew
but
he
obstinately
refused
even
to
listen
to
such
a
proposition
and
continued
his
wild
career
unchecked
the
unhappy
father
was
finally
compelled
to
ask
the
burgomaster
of
the
city
to
use
the
gentle
compulsion
of
the
law
which
was
done
there
are
few
sadder
pictures
in
the
history
of
letters
than
that
of
the
old
poet
bowed
down
with
this
greatest
of
all
griefs
the
realization
of
being
the
parent
of
ungrateful
and
criminal
offspring
standing
on
the
quay
and
bidding
with
bitter
agony
his
unfeeling
child
a
last
farewell
we
imagine
the
eyes
of
the
father
straining
for
one
more
glimpse
of
the
unworthy
but
yet
beloved
son
who
in
the
far
horizon
was
perhaps
even
then
carelessly
walking
the
deck
of
the
departing
ship
meditating
some
new
and
disgraceful
profligacy
upon
his
arrival
in
india
fortunately
he
died
on
the
journey
and
the
poet
was
doubtless
spared
much
suffering
too
bitterly
had
vondel
learned
even
as
lear
how
sharper
than
a
serpent
tooth
it
is
to
have
a
thankless
child
of
vondel
fortune
nothing
remained
save
the
portion
that
his
daughter
anna
had
inherited
from
her
mother
which
was
however
by
no
means
sufficient
to
support
them
both
what
was
to
be
done
all
that
the
old
man
could
do
was
to
write
verses
an
art
which
as
an
was
well
characterized
by
ovid
father
pater
dixit
studium
quid
inutile
tentas
mæonides
millas
ipse
reliquit
although
the
poet
in
his
pride
did
not
let
his
want
become
known
some
of
his
friends
who
knew
the
state
of
affairs
secured
him
a
position
as
clerk
in
the
bank
of
loan
at
a
salary
of
six
hundred
and
fifty
guldens
a
year
thus
the
greatest
dutchman
of
the
age
and
the
most
illustrious
poet
of
his
country
was
compelled
after
a
life
of
comparative
leisure
and
comfort
at
the
age
of
seventy
to
earn
his
living
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
forced
to
engage
in
a
labor
which
to
him
must
have
been
peculiarly
irksome
the
pen
which
had
been
accustomed
to
the
soaring
style
of
tragedy
was
now
chained
to
the
dreary
monotony
of
the
ledger
the
quill
that
had
so
often
stung
a
nation
to
the
quick
was
now
tamely
employed
in
the
prosaic
balance
of
debit
and
credit
it
is
said
that
the
poet
however
found
it
impossible
to
restrain
his
muse
entirely
and
that
he
sometimes
mounted
his
pegasus
even
in
the
dull
interior
of
the
for
he
employed
his
leisure
moments
let
us
hope
there
were
many
in
writing
verses
it
has
been
said
too
that
he
was
reprimanded
for
this
by
his
employers
but
of
this
there
is
no
proof
whatever
indeed
brandt
goes
out
of
his
way
to
say
that
this
was
overlooked
on
account
of
his
age
and
because
he
was
a
poet
and
could
therefore
not
be
expected
to
pay
such
strict
attention
to
business
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
indulge
in
a
little
sympathetic
bathos
here
the
poet
fate
was
indeed
a
hard
one
yet
his
salary
small
enough
it
is
true
when
we
consider
the
man
and
his
career
was
not
the
beggarly
pittance
that
the
same
amount
would
be
now
six
hundred
and
fifty
guldens
in
the
holland
of
that
day
would
be
equivalent
to
at
least
three
thousand
guldens
in
the
amsterdam
or
a
salary
of
hundred
dollars
in
new
york
furthermore
this
was
the
only
hard
mercantile
work
that
the
poet
ever
did
the
ten
years
of
drudgery
in
his
old
age
compensated
for
a
of
leisure
and
literary
retirement
for
after
his
marriage
at
the
poet
hosier
wisely
left
his
business
affairs
in
the
hands
of
his
energetic
and
trustworthy
wife
soon
after
her
death
the
business
devolved
on
joost
the
younger
with
the
disastrous
results
already
narrated
at
the
age
of
eighty
the
old
bard
was
given
an
honorable
discharge
with
full
pay
the
circumstances
of
which
were
not
without
pathos
when
told
that
he
was
discharged
and
that
another
had
been
found
to
take
his
place
the
poet
was
dumbfounded
and
became
very
sad
but
when
he
learned
that
his
discharge
was
an
honorable
one
with
a
pension
the
heaviness
left
him
and
he
seemed
greatly
pleased
never
however
was
vondel
so
near
the
brow
of
parnassus
as
during
these
ten
bitter
years
for
this
is
the
period
of
his
greatest
literary
activity
it
was
then
that
his
genius
ripened
into
its
full
maturity
among
other
works
produced
during
this
decade
were
his
jephtha
a
tragedy
with
which
he
himself
was
much
pleased
as
fulfilling
every
requirement
of
the
classic
drama
his
metrical
translations
of
the
œdipus
rex
iphigenia
in
tauris
and
the
trachiniæ
of
sophocles
the
tragedies
david
in
exile
and
david
restored
allegories
in
which
the
exile
and
the
restoration
of
charles
ii
were
clearly
set
forth
adonis
batavian
brothers
faeton
and
zungchin
or
the
fall
of
the
chinese
empire
of
special
interest
also
and
of
unusual
literary
merit
is
his
tragedy
samson
which
even
as
milton
samson
agonistes
was
perhaps
more
largely
biographical
than
any
other
of
his
poems
the
points
of
similarity
between
this
drama
and
milton
tragedy
also
are
many
and
remarkable
but
the
two
most
important
tragedies
of
this
period
were
his
adam
in
exile
and
the
noah
which
together
with
the
lucifer
form
a
grand
trilogy
the
adam
especially
only
less
sublime
than
the
latter
has
more
of
idyllic
beauty
and
as
a
whole
is
scarcely
inferior
in
power
here
too
the
choruses
blend
with
the
action
and
are
unsurpassed
for
melody
sweetness
and
tenderness
proclaiming
their
author
as
the
foremost
lyrist
of
his
nation
the
valley
vondel
was
the
author
of
no
less
than
tragedies
only
eighteen
of
these
however
were
presented
on
the
stage
some
were
deemed
objectionable
on
account
of
their
biblical
subject
matter
others
because
of
their
leaning
towards
catholicism
the
dramatist
also
suffered
from
the
jealousy
of
his
rivals
one
of
these
jan
vos
was
one
of
the
managers
of
the
theatre
and
attempted
to
make
vondel
plays
unpopular
by
assigning
the
most
important
rôles
to
inferior
players
and
also
by
using
old
and
costumes
no
wonder
then
that
the
sweeping
tragedies
of
this
master
spirit
began
to
lose
favor
with
the
masses
and
that
the
translations
of
the
french
and
spanish
plays
that
now
flooded
the
country
with
their
extravagant
scenery
and
their
flashy
innovations
usurped
their
place
a
few
years
before
his
death
vondel
paid
a
visit
to
the
town
of
his
birth
cologne
and
there
saw
the
very
house
where
he
was
born
with
a
poet
whim
he
climbed
into
the
old
wall
bedstead
in
which
he
was
brought
into
the
world
which
of
course
also
furnished
inspiration
for
a
poem
brief
mention
must
also
be
made
of
vondel
last
religious
poems
his
sublime
reflections
on
god
and
religion
which
was
written
in
opposition
to
the
epicurean
and
lucretian
philosophy
of
descartes
his
john
the
messenger
of
repentance
which
glows
with
all
the
fervor
and
the
grandeur
of
the
apocalypse
his
glory
of
the
church
a
work
as
learned
as
it
was
elevated
which
shows
the
rise
and
progress
of
the
mother
church
would
alone
be
sufficient
to
entitle
vondel
to
be
considered
as
one
of
the
great
religious
poets
of
the
world
and
perhaps
the
most
powerful
champion
of
catholicism
that
ever
entered
the
lists
of
controversy
at
the
age
of
vondel
translated
ovid
metamorphoses
and
also
wrote
a
great
number
of
poems
of
all
kinds
epigrams
lyrics
letters
lampoons
dedications
eulogies
threnodies
hymns
epithalamiums
riddles
and
epitaphs
in
all
of
which
his
pen
sharpened
by
the
practice
of
nearly
of
a
century
excelled
to
the
last
the
aged
poet
preserved
his
intense
satiric
vein
the
fire
of
his
spirit
burned
as
fiercely
now
as
in
the
days
of
his
youth
one
of
the
last
poems
written
by
those
aged
fingers
was
his
noble
elegy
on
the
distinguished
brothers
de
witt
who
in
were
assassinated
in
the
hague
by
a
frenzied
mob
his
last
production
was
an
epithalamium
on
the
marriage
of
his
favorite
niece
agnes
blok
he
was
then
years
old
his
physician
having
cautioned
him
to
rest
his
brain
he
now
bade
the
muses
whom
he
had
known
so
long
and
whom
he
had
found
so
sweet
a
comfort
in
his
hours
of
sorrow
an
eternal
farewell
his
health
however
remained
good
until
a
few
days
before
his
death
his
legs
first
showed
signs
of
weakness
and
refused
longer
to
support
him
his
memory
also
failed
him
and
he
would
often
stop
still
in
the
midst
of
a
sentence
when
he
was
made
aware
of
this
he
was
somewhat
distressed
for
his
judgment
remained
unimpaired
to
the
last
saying
i
am
no
longer
capable
of
carrying
on
a
conversation
with
my
friends
brandt
to
whom
we
are
indebted
for
most
of
these
interesting
particulars
concerning
vondel
and
other
friends
cheered
his
last
days
with
their
visits
the
poet
who
now
spent
most
of
his
waking
hours
by
the
cheerful
blaze
of
his
hearth
seemed
to
appreciate
this
very
highly
and
whenever
they
were
about
to
leave
would
tell
them
with
a
hearty
pressure
of
the
hand
here
too
came
antonides
that
brilliant
young
poet
so
untimely
cut
off
and
the
painter
philip
de
koning
both
of
whom
the
old
bard
admired
greatly
when
in
his
ninetieth
year
he
had
himself
taken
to
the
houses
of
the
two
burgomasters
of
the
city
whom
with
broken
words
he
begged
to
provide
for
his
grandson
justus
who
bore
his
name
and
whose
prospects
on
account
of
his
father
profligacy
and
his
grandfather
poverty
were
anything
but
promising
the
city
fathers
comforted
the
poor
old
man
with
good
words
and
he
returned
to
his
corner
by
the
hearth
never
again
to
leave
it
alive
old
age
says
brandt
was
now
his
illness
the
oil
was
lacking
the
fire
must
go
out
his
limbs
became
cold
and
refused
to
be
warmed
referring
to
this
a
few
days
before
his
death
he
remarked
to
brandt
with
a
humorous
twinkle
in
his
large
brown
eyes
you
might
give
me
this
epitaph
here
in
peace
lies
vondel
old
he
died
because
he
was
so
cold
this
was
the
old
poet
last
rhyme
surely
an
humble
one
for
him
whose
lofty
imagery
and
sublime
conceptions
are
the
wonder
of
his
countrymen
he
also
said
to
his
niece
agnes
blok
i
do
not
long
for
death
she
asked
do
you
not
long
for
eternal
life
he
replied
aye
i
do
long
for
that
but
like
elijah
i
would
fain
fly
thither
though
now
he
also
began
to
say
pray
for
me
that
god
will
take
me
out
of
this
life
and
when
those
standing
around
his
bedside
asked
are
you
ready
now
for
the
terrible
messenger
to
come
he
replied
aye
let
him
come
for
even
though
i
wait
longer

have
to
go
in
at
the
common
gate
after
an
illness
of
only
eight
days
on
february
about
four
in
the
morning
the
old
bard
fell
asleep
he
seemed
to
be
wholly
free
from
pain
and
died
so
softly
that
the
friends
who
stood
around
his
bedside
scarcely
observed
it
vondel
was
aged
years
two
months
and
nineteen
days
he
was
nearly
double
the
age
of
the
world
greatest
dramatist
was
seventeen
years
older
than
euripides
and
just
as
old
as
sophocles
three
days
after
his
death
he
was
buried
in
the
nieuwe

the
church
of

in
a
simple
grave
unmarked
by
even
an
epitaph
three
years
afterwards
joan

one
of
the
aldermen
of
the
city
had
the
following
which
gives
the
year
of
his
death
engraved
upon

to

shortly
after
his
decease
antonides
vollenhove
and
others
of
the
younger
poets
also
honored
him
with
eulogies
as
the
first
poet
of
his
age
to
the
a
medallion
was
given
on
one
side
of
which
was
the
image
of
the
poet
on
the
other
a
singing
swan
with
the
year
of
vondel
birth
and
death
and
the
inscription
the
oldest
and
greatest
poet
his
person
and
character
vondel
was
of
medium
height
with
a
figure
well
made
and
compact
his
countenance
was
one
of
remarkable
intelligence
and
was
characterized
by
an
expression
at
once
earnest
and
exalted
in
early
life
his
face
was
pale
and
thin
but
later
after
the
disappearance
of
his
strange
malady
it
became
broad
and
full
and
of
a
healthful
color
with
glowing
red
cheeks
his
forehead
not
too
high
was
broad
and
commanding
a
fit
arsenal
for
those
thunderbolts
of
invective
that
he
knew
so
well
how
to
employ
one
of
his
eyebrows
was
slightly
higher
than
the
other
beneath
them
glowed
two
deep
brown
eyes
large
and
penetrating
eagle
eyes
full
of
fire
as
if
naïvely
says
his
biographer
he
had
satires
in
his
head
his
nose
was
sensitive
and
somewhat
large
his
mouth
of
medium
size
with
rather
thin
lips
he
usually
wore
his
hair
short
his
ears
only
half
covered
on
his
chin
grew
a
small
pointed
beard
in
early
manhood
a
dark
brown
later
white
with
age
altogether
a
figure
striking
and
noble
if
not
grand
and
imposing
one
that
long
acquaintance
would
only
render
the
more
impressive
for
it
was
stamped
with
character
thus
the
outward
man
would
you
learn
the
stature
of
his
soul
read
his
magnificent
works
strange
to
say
he
who
was
so
full
of
thought
and
spirit
in
his
writings
was
still
and
silent
in
the
presence
of
others
once
when
dining
with
grotius
vossius
and
barlæus
the
three
most
learned
men
of
the
age
it
is
related
that
during
the
course
of
the
whole
meal
the
poet
said
not
one
word
he
was
usually
grave
and
taciturn
when
he
did
speak
however
he
was
intense
and
pointed
he
was
ever
modest
in
his
deportment
and
temperate
in
his
habits
though
living
in
an
age
of
good
fellowship
and
of
royal
tippling
when
drunkenness
was
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception
he
was
never
known
to
have
indulged
to
excess
like
dante
milton
and
petrarch
furthermore
his
private
life
was
pure
not
one
accuser
ever
threw
mud
at
its
whiteness
his
clothes
though
in
the
fashion
and
in
good
taste
were
always
plain
and
unassuming
he
enjoyed
the
society
of
artists
and
men
of
letters
learning
and
judgment
he
was
extremely
popular
among
his
relatives
which
speaks
well
for
his
heart
and
is
surely
a
good
index
to
his
true
character
vondel
was
a
true
friend
and
was
ever
ready
to
prove
his
devotion
if
need
be
by
the
sacrifice
of
blood
and
treasure
such
a
romantic
attachment
as
that
of
dante
for
beatrice
was
doubtless
unknown
to
our
poet
his
was
the
more
natural
ardor
of
a
affection
yet
he
had
the
capacity
for
suffering
so
characteristic
of
genius
we
know
that
like
william
he
was
profoundly
affected
by
the
death
of
his
wife
for
several
years
indeed
he
was
in
such
a
melancholy
that
his
thoughts
fell
from
his
pen
he
wrote
little
and
destroyed
all
that
he
wrote
life
had
lost
all
charms
for
him
he
was
however
awakened
from
this
reverie
of
sorrow
by
the
bugle
blast
of
war
and
only
in
the
roar
of
the
conflict
did
he
forget
the
sting
of
grief
vondel
was
in
no
sense
a
theologian
and
had
no
patience
with
distinctions
though
a
fervid
catholic
his
toleration
is
shown
by
his
remark
that
he
would
not
sit
in
the
inquisition
as
a
judge
of
anyone
life
there
were
some
papists
he
said
who
persecuted
the
pious
of
other
creeds
it
is
also
true
that
the
papists
of
all
time
have
sought
to
rule
the
consciences
of
men
however
some
reformers
are
lately
following
in
their
footsteps
in
regard
to
the
wonderful
legends
of
the
early
church
he
remarked
that
they
were
monkish
fables
written
in
the
dark
ages
for
the
ignorant
people
that
his
catholicism
had
not
lessened
his
love
for
freedom
or
for
his
country
his
later
poems
bear
excellent
witness
though
by
his
bitter
lampoons
and
severe
invective
he
had
made
many
enemies
during
the
course
of
his
long
career
yet
his
popularity
is
seen
in
the
fact
that
his
memory
was
honored
by
men
of
all
creeds
and
parties
the
jesuits
of
antwerp
placed
his
portrait
in
their
cloister
among
the
most
illustrious
men
of
ancient
and
modern
times
he
had
gathered
no
riches
with
his
poetry
on
the
contrary
his
losses
were
far
greater
than
his
gains
the
most
costly
gift
ever
given
him
was
the
golden
locket
and
chain
from
her
majesty
queen
christina
of
sweden
this
present
was
worth
about
two
hundred
dollars
amelia
von
solms
the
widow
of
frederic
henry
also
honored
him
with
a
gold
medal
for
a
poem
on
the
marriage
of
her
daughter
the
princess
henrietta
for
his
ode
on
the
dedication
of
the
new
stadthuis
the
authorities
of
amsterdam
honored
him
with
a
silver
cup
the
visiting
elector
of
one
of
the
german
states
gave
him
for
some
verses
in
his
honor
a
small
sixteen
guldens
for
his
eulogy
in
honor
of
the
archbishop
of
cologne
the
city
fathers
allowed
him
thirty
guldens
his
daughter
anna
dying
before
him
willed
him
her
portion
which
with
his
pension
proved
amply
sufficient
for
his
maintenance
a
few
months
before
his
death
he
had
willed
all
of
his
books
to
a
certain
priest
thinking
that
if
they
remained
with
him
he
might
injure
his
feeble
health
by
reading
he
allowed
them
to
be
taken
away
afterwards
however
he
bitterly
regretted
this
and
with
tears
in
his
eyes
complained
to
one
of
his
friends
that
all
of
his
treasures
had
been
stolen
and
that
now
nothing
was
left
him
in
his
youth
his
motto
was
love
conquers
all
things
later
he
signed
his
productions
with
the
word
zeal
or
justice
the
last
a
play
on
his
name
sometimes
also
with
the
letters
meaning
or
with
the
initials
palamedes
of
kologne
in
some
of
his
works
was
to
be
seen
a
picture
of
david
playing
a
harp
with
the
device
justus
fide
vivit
to
which
of
course
could
be
given
a
double
meaning
the
just
man
lives
by
faith
or
justus
lives
by
his
lyre
vondel
diligence
was
phenomenal
once
he
remarked
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
that
the
height
of
parnassus
can
only
be
attained
by
much
panting
and
sweat
and
that
attention
and
exercise
sharpen
the
intellect
the
multitude
and
the
excellence
of
his
works
prove
the
worth
of
his
philosophy
his
thirst
for
knowledge
was
extraordinary
and
he
left
few
corners
of
that
vast
field
unfilled
to
learn
the
best
expressions
for
each
trade
and
profession
he
was
wont
to
question
all
kinds
and
conditions
of
men
in
regard
to
the
words
that
they
used
in
their
trade
or
calling
farmers
carpenters
masons
artists
men
of
every
business
and
profession
added
to
his
vocabulary
he
thus
built
up
the
language
and
himself
attained
a
thorough
mastery
over
his
native
tongue
one
never
equalled
by
any
of
his
countrymen
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
poet
bilderdÿk
he
was
moreover
always
ready
to
receive
suggestions
in
regard
to
his
own
productions
and
often
read
them
to
his
friends
to
obtain
the
benefit
of
their
criticism
this
however
was
more
true
of
his
translations
than
of
his
originals
he
took
much
pleasure
also
in
praising
the
work
of
others
especially
that
of
the
younger
poets
that
he
was
an
excellent
critic
is
shown
by
his
prose
essays
though
he
was
too
impressionable
to
beauty
to
be
very
severe
he
was
exceedingly
modest
in
regard
to
his
own
powers
he
considered
hooft
the
foremost
among
the
dutch
writers
of
his
age
not
only
on
account
of
his
sweet
lyrics
and
stately
tragedies
but
also
because
of
his
historical
works
constantine
huyghens
he
praised
for
his
liveliness
and
fancy
his
subtlety
and
his
wonderful
versatility
he
also
thought
highly
of
anslo
and
de
dekker
and
particularly
of
those
two
young
giants
vollenhove
and
antonides
in
the
y
stream
of
the
latter
he
saw
extraordinary
promise
and
he
thenceforth
called
the
younger
poet
his
son
and
was
always
most
tender
and
fatherly
towards
him
taking
much
delight
in
his
company
of
vollenhove
triumph
of
christ
he
said
there
is
a
great
light
in
that
man
but
it
is
a
pity
that
he
is
a
clergyman
brandt
he
called
a
good
epigrammatist
his
feeling
for
art
art
to
vondel
was
a
revelation
of
the
divine
in
man
and
therefore
the
best
promoter
of
virtue
hence
his
passion
for
poetry
and
his
admiration
for
painting
music
and
architecture
how
fitting
that
he
who
sang
the
union
of
the
arts
blithe
poesy
and
painting
fair
two
sisters
debonair
should
be
crowned
king
of
the
feast
by
a
company
of
fellow
artists
vondel
was
the
painter
poet
he
wrote
numerous
inscriptions
for
paintings
he
praises
raphael
veronese
titian
bassano
giulo
romano
lastman
sandrart
goltzius
the
etcher
and
rubens
he
apparently
preferred
the
idealists
of
the
italian
school
for
he
says
but
little
about
the
realists
of
the
day
steen
ostade
brouwer
and
teniers
nor
even
concerning
those
who
copied
nature
like
douw
de
hoogh
and
mutsu
the
great
rembrandt
he
names
but
twice
in
one
place
he
speaks
of
the
portrait
of
cornelis
anslo
of
which
he
tamely
says
the
visible
part
is
the
least
of
him
and
who
would
see
anslo
must
hear
him
he
seems
to
have
been
more
impressed
by
the
fine
portrait
of
anna
wymers
for
he
says
anna
seems
to
be
alive
elsewhere
however
he
speaks
of
the
who
hides
himself
from
the
day
in
his
shadows
of
cobweb
which
is
thought
to
be
a
covert
reference
to
that
magnificent
study
in
chiaroscuro
rembrandt
night
patrol
it
is
certain
however
that
he
did
not
realize
the
powerful
genius
of
holland
greatest
artist
vondel
the
admirer
of
the
italian
classics
with
their
delicacy
and
regularity
probably
could
not
appreciate
the
revolutionary
splendors
of
this
great
magician
nor
is
there
any
evidence
to
show
that
any
friendship
existed
between
these
two
men
each
the
undying
glory
of
his
country
and
yet
in
some
respects
the
poet
and
the
painter
were
strikingly
alike
both
were
masters
of
style
and
grandly
daring
and
original
both
were
in
the
highest
sense
creative
and
dealt
in
tremendous
effects
soaring
from
of
grandeur
into
the
heaven
of
the
sublime
each
was
comprehensive
and
universal
each
was
a
personified
mood
of
his
nation
and
the
maker
of
an
epoch
each
suffered
poverty
in
old
age
yet
in
one
respect
the
painter
had
the
advantage
over
the
poet
he
spoke
the
universal
language
of
the
eye
and
thus
his
message
has
reached
millions
who
were
deaf
to
his
tongue
the
political
obscurity
on
the
other
hand
into
which
little
holland
was
plunged
so
soon
after
the
meteoric
blaze
of
her
brief
ascendancy
confined
her
language
to
her
narrow
territory
and
vondel
equally
worthy
with
rembrandt
of
the
admiration
of
the
world
became
a
sealed
book
save
to
his
countrymen
the
former
however
was
the
very
life
of
his
time
its
recognized
voice
the
latter
was
in
his
life
neglected
to
become
after
his
death
the
most
illustrious
of
his
race
a
name
to
conjure
an
age
out
of
obscurity
rubens
on
the
other
hand
the
poet
fully
appreciated
in
the
dedication
of
his
drama
the
brothers
he
calls
the
great
fleming
the
glory
among
the
pencils
of
our
age
music
we
know
had
a
powerful
fascination
for
our
poet
he
himself
played
the
lute
while
his
poetry
throbs
with
the
very
heart
of
melody
how
lovingly
he
speaks
of
the
divine
art
of
song
that
charms
the
soul
out
of
the
body
filling
it
with
rare
delight
a
foretaste
of
the
bliss
of
the
angels
how
keen
must
have
been
his
enjoyment
when
at
muiden
he
heard
the
lovely
singers
of
that
age
the
gifted
tesselschade
on
her
guitar
or
the
talented
harpist
christina
van
erp
or
when
in
his
home
in
the
warmoesstraat
he
heard
the
patriotic
chimes
of
his
beloved
city
pealing
the
lingering
hours
into
oblivion
how
profoundly
too
must
his
deep
earnest
soul
have
been
stirred
by
the
grandeur
of
the
psalms
rising
on
the
wings
of
zweling
noble
melodies
to
the
vaulted
arches
of
the
old
cathedral
where
he
was
wont
to
worship
his
feeling
for
nature
the
attitude
of
a
poet
toward
nature
is
always
of
peculiar
and
absorbing
interest
is
it
because
she
is
the
perpetual
fount
of
ideals
because
of
her
voiceless
sympathy
with
his
mood
or
because
her
grandeur
and
loveliness
have
power
to
move
the
deeps
of
his
soul
however
it
be
the
poets
have
almost
without
exception
found
her
the
source
of
their
inspiration
into
her
rude
confessional
they
pour
the
unreserved
tale
of
sorrows
that
no
man
can
understand
and
she
gently
whispers
peace
at
her
feet
they
lay
the
guilty
story
of
a
soul
the
love
the
passions
of
a
heart
the
joys
the
pains
the
riotous
thoughts
of
life
and
she
gently
whispers
peace
and
here
too
vondel
opened
his
heart
and
here
he
also
obtained
comfort
for
the
vexing
ills
of
life
it
has
been
said
that
man
appreciation
of
the
beauties
of
nature
is
proportioned
to
the
degree
of
his
cultivation
in
the
ruder
ages
in
holland
as
in
germany
the
mysterious
forces
of
the
physical
world
and
their
various
manifestations
became
personified
in
the
good
and
bad
genii
of
the
teutonic
mythology
in
proportion
as
the
worship
of
these
genii
ceased
nature
became
appreciated
for
its
own
sake
it
had
first
to
be
divested
of
the
supernatural
to
this
christianity
and
the
accumulating
discoveries
in
science
largely
contributed
karel
van
mander
first
introduced
this
feeling
into
painting
and
hendrik
spieghel
into
literature
and
then
came
hooft
and
vondel
who
in
this
respect
as
in
all
else
stood
far
above
their
contemporaries
vondel
enjoyment
of
nature
is
not
so
keen
as
that
of
hooft
but
it
is
far
deeper
and
stronger
and
grew
steadily
to
the
end
of
his
life
now
and
then
his
descriptions
remind
one
of
the
brooding
landscapes
of
the
melancholy
ruysdael
at
other
times
of
the
creations
of
lingelbach
and
pynacker
in
those
striking
scenes
where
dutch
realism
and
italian
fancy
are
oddly
combined
under
the
influence
of
seneca
and
du
bartas
according
to
the
artificial
fashion
of
the
day
he
at
first
employed
mythological
names
as
symbols
for
the
things
themselves
but
he
soon
outgrew
this
classical
affectation
already
in
his
palamedes
especially
in
the
chorus
of
eubeers
is
this
feeling
for
nature
apparent
this
charming
bucolic
is
the
picture
of
a
dutch
landscape
elsewhere
we
have
mentioned
its
resemblance
to
the
of
milton
like
the
bard
of
avon
our
poet
saw
but
little
of
the
world
twice
he
made
a
business
trip
to
denmark
and
shortly
before
his
death
he
paid
a
visit
to
cologne
in
addition
to
this
he
made
several
inland
journeys
one
to
the
gooi
where
the
grand
oak
so
thickly
grows
beyond
rich
fields
where
buckwheat
glows
to
vondel
truly
the
heavens
declare
the
glory
of
god
and
the
firmament
showeth
his
handiwork
all
of
his
poems
particularly
the
lucifer
are
studded
with
figures
of
the
stars
the
poet
drew
many
of
his
figures
too
from
animal
life
as
the
beasts
and
the
birds
in
the
sustained
virgilian
similes
in
the
lucifer
what
can
be
more
exquisite
also
than
his
verses
on
the
tame
sparrow
of
the
lovely
susanne
bartelot
in
the
style
of
the
passer
deliciæ
suæ
puellæ
of
catullus
the
north
wind
he
calls
a
so
cold
and
rough
the
spring
is
his
delight
he
is
glad
when
he
sees
men
busy
fishing
planting
and
hunting
and
engaged
in
all
manner
of
bucolic
occupations
in
the
norway
pines
unloaded
on
the
river
y
he
sees
a
forest
of
masts
from
which
the
tricolor
of
his
dear
country
will
be
unfurled
in
every
clime
would
you
know
his
capacity
for
aesthetic
symbolism
read
his
superb
ode
to
the
rhine
flowers
were
to
him
the
beautiful
symbols
of
equally
beautiful
moral
truths
what
a
world
of
pathos
in
his
voice
where
he
says
of
mary
queen
of
scots
o
roman
rose
cut
from
her
bleeding
stem
and
where
he
speaks
of
the
mournful
rosemary
in
the
of
his
little
daughter
saartje
for
little
maria
his
darling
he
wishes
a
winding
sheet
of
flowers
of
violets
white
and
red
and
purple
blue
and
yellow
in
the
garlands
of
his
fancy
he
ever
weaves
the
blooms
of
his
delight
lilies
violets
roses
white
and
red
and
his
national
flower
the
glorious
tulip
he
loved
the
open
heaven
and
the
airy
freedom
of
solitude
the
welkin
wide
is
mine
he
says
and
like
a
wild
bird
adds
and
mine
the
open
sky
he
loved
the
woods
where
his
ears
were
caressed
by
the
blithe
echoes
of
the
careless
birds
long
before
shelley
he
sang
of
the
lark
wiens
keeltje
steiltjes
steigert
whose
throat
so
steeply
soars
long
before
keats
he
was
thrilled
by
the
nightingale
the
nightingale
who
at
thy
casement
bower
pours
out
his
breathless
tale
reminds
him
of
the
questioning
soul
at
the
window
of
eternity
peering
through
panes
on
darkness
unconfined
then
again
he
likens
himself
to
a
nightingale
caged
for
days
in
the
mournful
cold
that
bursts
into
a
rapturous
melody
to
see
the
warm
sun
melt
away
the
gloom
his
soul
communed
with
nature
in
her
deepest
and
quietest
moods
the
peaceful
meadow
the
calm
beauty
of
the
woods
the
mountains
the
tumultuous
sea
were
all
the
themes
of
his
song
though
his
feeling
for
nature
was
not
so
fine
nor
so
intense
as
that
of
some
of
the
later
poets
yet
it
was
deeper
and
truer
in
the
world
around
him
he
saw
but
a
reflection
of
the
grander
world
beyond
nor
was
the
pantheistic
conception
strange
to
him
see
the
first
chorus
of
the
lucifer
where
he
calls
god
the
soul
of
all
we
can
conceive
and
the
second
act
where
he
speaks
of
the
farthest
rounds
and
endless
circles
of
eternity
that
from
the
bounds
of
time
and
space
set
free
revolve
unceasingly
around
one
god
who
is
their
centre
and
circumference
how
like
the
pantheism
of
spinoza
first
proclaimed
some
years
later
his
patriotism
would
you
know
him
as
a
patriot
hear
his
splendid
tones
of
jubilation
over
the
victory
of
his
countrymen
a
victory
where
truth
and
freedom
triumphed
hear
his
fine
odes
celebrating
the
commerce
and
the
progress
of
the
growing
commonwealth
listen
to
his
bursts
of
patriotism
in
his
orange
may
song
and
where
he
calls
the
ancient
greek
child
play
beside
ours
vondel
was
a
representative
dutchman
and
there
was
a
strong
national
stamp
on
all
that
he
did
he
was
a
grand
type
of
the
burgher
of
the
great
dutch
middle
class
which
has
ever
been
the
glory
of
the
netherlands
and
which
has
given
to
the
world
such
an
illustrious
array
of
soldiers
painters
scholars
poets
and
statesmen
in
reading
him
we
are
continually
reminded
that
we
are
in
the
land
of
dykes
and
windmills
thus
all
of
his
heroes
are
invested
with
holland
dignities
we
hear
of
burghers
burgomasters
and
stadtholders
of
the
dunes
the
sea
the
dams
the
strand
and
the
green
fertile
meadows
wherever
the
scene
of
the
play
we
always
recognize
the
streets
the
canals
the
houses
the
palaces
and
the
environs
of
amsterdam
this
was
not
due
to
a
lack
of
historical
information
as
was
the
case
with
shakespeare
but
because
the
poet
desired
to
bring
the
truth
closer
to
the
hearts
of
his
hearers
the
fact
too
that
this
made
the
scenic
requirements
of
a
play
considerably
less
thus
reducing
the
expense
of
presentation
might
also
have
had
some
influence
vondel
furthermore
when
representing
the
past
never
forgot
the
present
it
was
ever
before
his
eyes
hence
many
of
his
plays
were
political
allegories
and
were
significant
for
their
bearing
upon
the
time
the
one
universal
characterization
of
all
of
his
work
one
that
glows
in
every
poem
is
his
love
of
freedom
the
ruling
passion
of
his
countrymen
already
in
the
passover
his
first
tragedy
written
at
the
age
of
we
hear
his
cry
o
sweetest
freedom
soon
afterwards
in
his
lyrics
and
in
palamedes
he
showed
his
strong
sympathy
with
oldenbarneveldt
and
during
the
bitter
persecution
that
followed
when
he
was
forced
to
fly
like
a
hunted
beast
from
house
to
house
this
spirit
grew
by
the
opposition
that
it
fed
upon
into
a
fierce
blaze
only
quenched
by
death
like
the
father
of
tuscan
literature
his
thoughts
were
ever
attuned
to
the
spirit
of
his
age
like
dante
too
he
was
ever
in
the
heart
of
the
battle
like
him
also
he
was
not
worldly
wise
and
was
naturally
of
a
rebellious
temperament
he
was
himself
in
perpetual
revolt
this
was
due
however
not
to
a
saturnine
disposition
but
to
a
keen
sense
of
justice
and
to
the
idealism
of
a
lofty
cultivated
mind
to
compel
the
age
to
conform
to
the
measure
of
his
own
conceptions
he
often
found
procrustean
methods
necessary
hence
his
stern
aggressiveness
against
wrong
he
fain
would
have
sat
apart
in
silent
contemplation
but
he
was
destined
to
know
neither
the
olympic
calm
of
goethe
nor
the
sublime
serenity
of
shakespeare
the
life
of
the
day
like
an
octopus
grasped
him
and
would
not
let
him
go
he
drank
in
the
wine
of
freedom
and
his
soul
was
filled
with
the
hunger
of
strife
his
cry
now
became
a
wherever
he
saw
wrong
and
injustice
and
his
eyes
were
ever
open
he
donned
his
armor
and
dealt
crushing
blows
for
the
cause
of
the
oppressed
earnest
still
and
passionate
great
of
soul
and
impressionable
of
heart
the
poet
was
a
born
fighter
his
whole
life
was
a
polemic
against
tyranny
his
dear
fatherland
was
the
alpha
and
omega
of
his
inspiration
and
he
was
perhaps
the
first
dutchman
who
deeply
felt
the
consciousness
of
national
power
the
next
object
of
his
soul
affection
was
his
city
amsterdam
whose
glories
he
never
grew
tired
of
singing
his
characterization
the
town
of
commerce
amsterdam
known
round
the
circle
of
the
globe
might
not
improperly
be
reflected
upon
its
new
and
yet
more
powerful
namesake
in
the
new
world
of
whose
grandeur
he
might
well
be
deemed
the
prophet
when
in
his
gysbrecht
with
patriotic
eloquence
he
pictures
the
amsterdam
of
the
coming
centuries
what
though
the
ruling
trident
has
departed
from
the
venice
of
the
north
her
peerless
daughter
far
across
the
seas
yet
holds
triumphant
sway
in
his
fiery
patriotism
vondel
much
reminds
us
of
milton
he
also
was
at
heart
a
zealous
republican
though
he
had
a
christian
unshaken
reverence
for
the
anointed
kings
of
earth
and
for
what
he
thought
a
authority
hence
the
lucifer
and
his
relentless
opposition
to
the
regicides
of
england
and
to
cromwell
that
murderer
without
god
and
shame
who
dared
to
desecrate
and
to
assault
the
anointed
as
he
says
bitterly
in
one
of
his
polemics
like
the
great
englishman
the
hollander
was
also
a
good
hater
and
he
never
spared
what
he
hated
though
charitable
he
was
uncompromising
and
forgave
not
easily
always
however
deprecating
the
excesses
of
the
root
and
branch
zealots
of
his
own
party
just
as
milton
after
having
joined
the
presbyterians
forsook
them
when
they
in
turn
began
to
persecute
the
followers
of
other
creeds
so
too
vondel
left
the
remonstrants
when
they
crossed
the
jealous
line
of
freedom
we
are
indeed
inclined
to
believe
that
his
strongest
trait
was
his
love
of
justice
which
caused
him
to
oppose
tyranny
under
every
guise
and
to
stigmatize
the
faults
of
his
own
church
and
party
with
expletives
as
crushing
as
those
that
he
hurled
against
his
enemies
thus
his
hatred
of
the
catholic
spaniards
and
of
the
dutch
gomarists
the
bloody
persecution
of
the
one
was
in
his
eyes
no
worse
than
the
oppressive
hypocrisy
of
the
other
even
his
beloved
house
of
orange
drew
from
him
the
bitterest
opposition
when
in
prince
maurice
and
in
william
it
threatened
the
liberty
of
his
country
and
the
privileges
of
his
beloved
amsterdam
of
him
it
may
truly
be
said
that
his
eyes
were
never
blinded
by
party
prejudice
milton
in
an
immortal
sonnet
blew
a
of
vengeance
for
the
slaughtered
piedmontese
why
was
that
trumpet
silent
w
hen
his
own
party
perpetrated
a
similar
massacre
at
drogheda
vondel
was
indeed
far
more
magnanimous
than
his
great
english
contemporary
he
had
more
of
the
milk
of
human
kindness
how
strong
is
our
poet
admiration
for
the
founders
of
the
republic
the
fathers
of
the
golden
age
and
for
that
grand
race
of
intrepid
discoverers
pioneers
and
explorers
that
pierced
every
corner
of
the
globe
how
too
flames
his
soul
with
pride
when
he
recounts
the
brave
deeds
of
those
old
tromp
and
de
ruyter
and
their
fearless
companions
in
the
fierce
battle
against
the
growing
english
supremacy
not
one
of
those
heroes
whom
he
did
not
crown
with
the
wreath
of
an
immortal
eulogy
yet
vondel
even
as
dante
was
at
heart
a
man
of
peace
like
his
countrymen
he
never
sought
the
fray
but
when
battle
was
forced
upon
him
it
meant
a
fight
to
the
death
all
his
fighting
was
for
peace
in
one
of
his
poems
he
speaks
of
peace
as
a
treasure
ah
its
worth
unknown
surpassing
far
a
triumph
in
renown
elsewhere
he
says
the
olive
more
than
laurel
pleases
me
he
never
forgot
the
high
seriousness
of
his
mission
he
never
lost
sight
of
the
dignity
of
christian
manhood
vondel
was
in
a
large
sense
also
the
poet
of
christendom
a
crusader
with
his
face
ever
towards
the
new
jerusalem
throned
in
ethereal
splendors
he
felt
himself
a
member
of
that
large
christian
alliance
that
henry
iv
wished
to
found
as
a
barrier
against
the
encroachments
of
the
turk
the
of
christendom
he
comes
the
turk
we
stand
with
winged
arms
he
shouts
in
one
of
his
poems
yet
he
never
forgot
to
pray
also
that
the
erring
ones
both
jew
and
gentile
might
be
brought
into
the
fold
of
the
true
church
his
views
on
life
of
particular
interest
are
the
views
of
so
old
and
so
profound
a
seer
on
life
for
every
poet
has
his
scheme
of
life
what
men
call
genius
is
indeed
only
the
faculty
of
seeing
life
through
the
prism
of
a
temperament
and
the
poets
are
preëminently
the
men
of
temperament
vondel
with
his
earnest
sincere
nature
out
of
the
bewildering
chaos
of
his
environment
soon
evolved
his
own
philosophy
of
existence
life
that
sad
tragedy
the
youthful
poet
calls
it
in
his
passover
to
him
already
life
was
a
passing
pageant
and
man
an
exile
his
epitome
of
the
world
history
moreover
is
not
unlike
the
celebrated
epigram
of
rhÿnvis
feith
another
dutch
poet
man
like
a
withered
leaf
falls
in
oblivion
wave
we
are
and
fade
away
the
cradle
and
the
grave
between
them
flits
a
dream
a
drama
of
the
heart
smart
yields
his
place
to
joy
and
joy
again
to
smart
the
monarch
mounts
his
throne
the
slave
bows
to
the
floor
death
breathes
upon
the
scene
the
players
are
no
more
his
gaze
like
milton
was
ever
upward
through
the
of
time
into
the
unconfined
vast
of
eternity
his
tone
too
was
most
glorious
when
singing
celestial
things
how
like
the
voice
of
a
hebrew
prophet
his
note
of
warning
where
he
cries
batavians
repent
think
of
tyre
and
sidon
repent
as
the
ninevites
o
mourn
your
sins
and
after
all
this
painful
revelry
of
life
this
lust
of
action
and
the
battle
roar
it
is
a
haven
sweet
and
still
that
his
soul
longs
for
how
softly
he
whispers
after
his
fiery
trumpet
tones
are
done
o
help
me
o
my
god
to
give
my
life
to
thee
my
fragile
self
my
will
my
little
all
let
me
o
thou
beyond
compare
o
source
of
everything
in
praises
rich
and
deep
thy
matchless
glory
sing
in
the
pensive
twilight
of
old
age
he
grew
more
and
more
conscious
of
the
true
everlasting
and
his
patriotism
became
the
one
of
the
fatherland
above
he
now
began
to
look
forward
with
faith
to
the
revelations
of
the
resurrection
though
not
forgetting
that
the
infant
of
eternity
must
first
be
cradled
in
the
tomb
but
believing
that
from
the
cerements
of
mystery
shall
break
a
light
to
lead
the
soul
to
heaven
his
place
and
art
vondel
to
an
extraordinary
degree
possessed
that
keen
insight
into
human
nature
which
is
the
first
requisite
of
the
great
satirist
he
was
the
juvenal
of
his
time
though
his
wit
is
never
delicate
nor
keen
it
is
however
sweeping
and
irresistible
his
was
no
gentle
zephyr
of
irony
to
tickle
the
tender
cuticle
of
a
supersensitive
age
but
a
very
cyclone
of
mockery
to
laugh
a
generation
out
of
folly
his
poetry
is
ever
the
instrument
of
exaltation
and
though
in
its
condemnation
of
evil
it
often
by
its
directness
and
frankness
gives
some
offense
to
the
delicate
edge
of
our
modern
refinement
it
is
never
indecently
coarse
it
is
never
a
pander
to
vice
indignation
more
intense
scorn
more
contemptuous
satire
more
powerful
invective
more
tremendous
than
that
glowing
in
the
polemics
of
this
great
satirist
have
never
struck
fear
into
the
hardened
hearts
of
the
wicked
few
men
have
been
so
hated
few
have
been
so
loved
yet
the
sublime
is
the
true
field
of
this
poet
and
sublimer
thoughts
than
his
were
surely
never
spoken
the
grandeur
of
job
the
glory
of
the
psalms
and
the
splendor
of
the
apocalypse
are
all
to
be
found
in
his
magnificent
biblical
tragedies
that
noble
series
commencing
with
the
jerusalem
desolate
of
his
untried
youth
and
ending
with
the
noah
of
his
octogenarian
ripeness
the
influence
of
the
bible
on
his
art
was
prodigious
the
holy
writ
was
the
inexhaustible
quarry
from
which
he
hewed
his
master
pieces
throughout
whose
development
may
be
traced
the
growth
of
a
human
soul
see
his
paraphrase
of
the
psalms
if
you
would
know
his
enjoyment
of
the
serene
beauty
of
holiness
the
artistic
truth
of
all
his
creations
is
seen
in
their
elemental
objectivity
the
portrayal
by
vivid
flashes
of
feeling
and
by
artful
representation
of
the
and
imperishable
in
most
of
his
dramas
is
the
sublimity
of
æschylus
with
the
fine
proportion
and
the
directness
of
sophocles
in
others
as
in
the
leeuwendalers
where
he
sings
the
triumph
of
peace
is
the
sweetness
and
the
feminine
strength
of
euripides
of
vondel
it
has
truly
been
said
tetigit
quod
non
for
to
beauty
god
handmaid
beauty
whose
touch
rounds
a
or
a
world
he
ever
paid
the
incense
of
a
passionate
devotion
æschylus
does
right
without
knowing
it
said
sophocles
even
so
vondel
possessed
an
unerring
instinct
for
the
true
ever
stringing
the
jewelled
beads
of
fancy
on
the
golden
thread
of
truth
like
æschylus
too
he
was
at
heart
a
lyric
poet
yet
who
shall
say
that
in
his
character
delineation
in
the
sweeping
energy
of
his
action
and
in
the
management
of
his
plot
he
was
not
almost
equally
as
admirable
like
dryden
vondel
rose
very
slowly
to
the
stature
of
his
full
power
all
of
his
dramas
preceding
the
lucifer
show
this
gradual
development
all
of
those
that
come
later
maintain
the
same
standard
of
excellence
like
goethe
the
dutch
poet
exerted
an
ennobling
influence
on
the
theatre
of
his
country
like
dante
he
was
fond
of
a
strong
bold
outline
and
always
chose
a
direct
rather
than
a
circuitous
route
like
shakespeare
he
was
a
keen
observer
of
affairs
a
student
of
life
his
works
are
the
rimed
chronicles
of
his
age
his
was
a
transcendent
genius
not
oppressed
by
excessive
culture
and
with
the
creative
ever
the
ruling
instinct
to
him
poetry
was
the
divinest
of
the
arts
it
became
the
ritual
of
his
soul
worship
duty
beauty
and
religion
were
the
three
strings
on
his
melodious
lyre
his
works
abound
in
little
scholasticism
pedantry
and
affectation
were
his
abomination
pith
and
vigor
directness
and
comprehensiveness
the
radical
elements
of
his
strength
in
his
works
we
find
a
harvest
of
such
glorious
themes
as
store
the
granary
of
poet
minds
we
see
everywhere
evidences
of
power
we
are
ever
startled
by
the
lightning
flash
of
an
immortal
thought
the
rolling
thunder
of
a
mighty
line
vondel
similes
are
more
striking
than
his
metaphors
there
is
a
sustained
glow
in
his
imagery
in
this
respect
also
he
shows
the
oriental
bent
of
his
genius
this
is
furthermore
seen
in
his
personification
of
the
elements
of
nature
and
of
the
stars
and
constellations
as
in
the
lucifer
which
gives
a
barbaric
splendor
to
the
play
few
poets
indeed
in
any
literature
contain
such
splendid
and
elevated
images
he
too
could
woo
discordant
sounds
to
harmony
and
wove
the
consonantal
dutch
into
mellow
meshes
of
ensnaring
sound
a
nobleness
not
devoid
of
grace
a
sublimity
not
austere
but
warm
with
human
sympathy
a
manner
more
remarkable
for
chaste
strength
and
a
rugged
symmetry
of
form
than
for
delicacy
or
elegance
these
are
some
of
the
characteristics
of
his
style
not
for
him
the
sweet
felicities
of
the
mincing
phraser
or
the
dreamy
languors
of
the
riming
troubadour
not
for
him
the
gaysome
zephyr
or
the
dim
romantic
moon
he
is
ever
on
the
serene
altitude
of
lofty
contemplation
or
in
the
valley
battling
like
a
god
he
is
always
deeply
serious
he
is
everywhere
sincere
his
is
the
whirlwind
and
the
storm
the
noonday
glare
and
the
midnight
gloom
his
is
the
bold
epic
flight
and
the
lark
wild
lyric
soar
no
nightingale
of
sentiment
trills
her
dulcet
serenade
amid
the
forest
of
his
song
and
yet
who
can
be
more
tender
and
affecting
who
more
truly
softly
sweet
all
is
virile
nothing
is
effeminate
all
is
manly
healthful
pure
there
is
no
morbid
fever
of
a
brain
diseased
and
foul
there
is
no
pale
misleading
of
a
heart
decayed
and
bad
there
is
freshness
there
is
beauty
there
is
truth
magnificent
is
the
one
word
for
his
manner
the
grand
style
of
the
netherlands
his
was
the
sombre
occidental
imagination
fired
with
the
splendor
of
the
orient
his
poetry
is
a
gothic
cathedral
grand
towering
and
impressive
typical
at
once
of
the
massive
ruggedness
of
the
oak
and
the
severe
sublimity
of
the
alp
a
teutonic
temple
in
whose
cloistered
corridors
we
hear
the
majestic
sweep
of
unseen
angels
wings
while
the
glorious
symphony
of
harps
and
psalteries
played
by
countless
cherubim
mingling
with
the
rich
bass
of
the
organ
and
the
ethereal
tenor
of
invisible
choristers
rolls
like
a
flood
of
celestial
harmony
through
all
the
deep
diapason
from
heaven
to
hell
the
word
vondel
in
the
brabantian
dialect
means
a
little
bridge
which
suggests
a
not
inapt
analogy
for
it
was
vondel
who
bridged
the
chasm
between
the
crude
mystery
and
miracle
plays
of
the
chambers
of
rhetoric
and
the
lucifer
a
drama
unequalled
in
the
history
of
dutch
literature
between
the
dead
abstractions
of
the
chambers
and
the
warm
concrete
life
of
the
sublime
vondelian
drama
even
as
between
gorboduc
and
hamlet
lay
the
experience
of
one
soul
hooft
like
heiberg
in
denmark
and
lessing
in
germany
instituted
a
revolution
in
the
world
of
taste
but
vondel
even
more
than
hooft
developed
the
latent
powers
of
the
tongue
enlarged
its
resources
and
fixed
its
form
his
is
still
the
noblest
of
dutch
diction
possessing
that
strange
virility
that
defies
time
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
the
language
was
hardly
fit
for
literary
use
the
school
of
vondel
in
one
generation
the
first
half
of
the
seventeenth
century
did
for
holland
what
the
thirteenth
century
had
done
for
italy
and
the
sixteenth
for
england
vondel
no
less
than
shakespeare
was
the
creator
of
an
epoch
his
influence
on
his
own
language
was
equally
as
wonderful
his
impress
on
his
literature
almost
as
great
to
him
the
poets
of
the
following
generations
even
the
great
bilderdÿk
looked
for
inspiration
to
him
also
they
have
ever
paid
homage
like
homer
he
also
found
his
zoilus
but
the
greatest
intellects
of
his
country
and
his
age
and
surely
few
epochs
have
seen
greater
grotius
hooft
vossius
huyghens
and
scores
of
others
of
almost
equal
fame
thought
him
not
inferior
to
the
noblest
poets
of
antiquity
vondel
lived
in
a
memorable
epoch
and
was
its
personification
it
was
the
augustan
era
of
holland
the
dutch
age
of
pericles
amsterdam
like
another
athens
had
become
the
centre
of
the
world
civilization
nowhere
in
that
age
were
the
arts
so
sedulously
cultivated
nowhere
had
their
cultivation
been
rewarded
by
such
high
attainment
science
the
world
puzzler
opened
his
the
universe
and
showed
its
countless
wonders
philosophy
with
guessive
hand
played
at
the
riddle
destiny
and
mild
religion
at
the
game
of
war
literature
the
sum
of
all
the
arts
and
all
the
sciences
shone
like
the
dazzling
arctic
sun
in
its
brief
midnight
noon
one
hour
of
glory
in
a
day
of
gloom
when
the
poet
died
the
epoch
died
with
him
a
night
of
mediocrity
now
brooded
over
the
marshy
fens
of
holland
a
swarm
of
poetasters
succeeded
the
race
of
poets
originality
was
banished
affectation
with
his
sycophantic
wiles
had
won
the
heart
of
a
degenerate
generation
art
like
a
flower
suddenly
deprived
of
the
warm
kisses
of
day
pined
away
in
the
sterile
cold
genius
was
dead
vondel
is
preëminently
the
poet
of
freedom
the
principles
sanctified
by
the
blood
of
his
countrymen
and
won
by
nearly
a
century
of
the
most
noble
daring
and
heroic
endurance
he
as
the
voice
of
his
nation
glorified
in
his
beautiful
pastoral
the
leeuwendalers
these
same
principles
also
became
the
rallying
shout
of
the
english
revolution
of
that
same
reechoing
at
lexington
and
alamance
swept
the
american
colonies
from
bunker
hill
to
guilford
court
house
like
a
whirlwind
of
flame
and
tyranny
with
shuddering
dread
fled
to
its
native
lair
the
shibboleth
of
liberty
first
blown
with
stirring
trumpet
tones
across
the
watery
moors
of
holland
by
the
vondel
was
now
repeated
in
deathless
prose
at
mecklenburg
and
philadelphia
a
new
united
states
arose
like
a
glorious
phoenix
from
the
ashes
of
the
old
for
the
american
constitution
was
but
the
grand
conclusion
of
that
lingering
bloody
syllogism
of
freedom
of
which
the
treaty
of
munster
was
the
major
premise
and
vondel
inspired
logician
of
the
true
unravelling
the
tangled
skein
of
his
country
destiny
also
uncoiled
the
golden
thread
of
our
great
fate
of
his
magnificent
works
the
natural
heritage
of
the
american
people
we
here
present
this
choice
fragment
the
lucifer
aglow
with
the
eternal
spirit
of
revolt
and
now
we
leave
our
poet
a
spotless
name
the
record
of
a
noble
sacrificing
life
a
message
of
beauty
and
a
treasury
of
immortal
truths
this
was
vondel
legacy
to
his
countrymen
the
lucifer
away
away
into
the
where
myth
and
mystery
walk
hand
in
hand
where
legend
cons
her
lore
and
sphinx
and
gorgon
throng
the
silent
shore
the
paradise
history
the
paradise
history
as
solving
the
problem
of
the
origin
of
man
and
the
origin
of
evil
and
as
foreshadowing
the
goal
of
human
destiny
has
always
been
a
subject
of
universal
concern
one
full
of
fascination
for
the
imagination
of
the
poet
few
subjects
indeed
have
aroused
such
widely
diffused
and
long
sustained
interest
beginning
with
the
creation
of
the
spanish
monk
dracontius
the
biblical
paraphrases
of
the
old
english
poet
cædmon
and
the
latin
poem
of
avitus
bishop
of
vienna
we
see
at
different
periods
various
studies
of
this
absorbing
theme
especially
in
italy
where
a
score
or
more
poets
and
essayists
made
it
the
source
of
their
inspiration
perhaps
the
most
noted
of
these
was
andrieni
who
wrote
the
adamo
a
tragedy
in
five
acts
whose
subject
is
the
fall
of
man
this
drama
however
is
a
rather
crude
affair
such
allegorical
abstractions
as
death
sin
and
despair
being
the
chief
characters
about
the
same
period
strange
to
say
the
netherland
imagination
not
long
awakened
from
its
medieval
torpor
also
became
fired
with
this
theme
the
youthful
grotius
was
the
first
to
attempt
it
in
his
adamus
exul
a
latin
drama
of
considerable
merit
this
was
in
several
years
before
the
adamo
of
andrieni
two
other
dutchmen
of
the
same
generation
both
far
greater
poets
than
grotius
were
also
attracted
by
this
subject
one
was
the
distinguished
father
cats
in
his
idyll
the
first
marriage
the
other
was
justus
van
den
vondel
in
his
lucifer
we
would
in
passing
call
attention
to
the
curious
coincidence
that
so
many
poets
of
so
many
different
nations
most
of
them
doubtless
without
knowledge
of
the
others
should
about
the
same
time
have
chosen
this
subject
of
such
historical
and
symbolical
importance
for
besides
the
poets
mentioned
were
many
others
the
scotchman
ramsay
the
spaniard
de
azevedo
the
portuguese
camoens
the
frenchman
du
bartas
and
two
englishmen
phineas
fletcher
and
john
milton
a
more
remarkable
instance
of
telepathy
is
not
we
believe
on
record
of
all
of
the
works
of
the
many
authors
who
have
treated
this
theme
only
two
however
have
withstood
the
critical
test
of
time
only
two
have
been
awarded
the
palm
of
immortality
these
two
are
paradise
lost
and
vondel
lucifer
the
former
the
grandest
of
english
epics
the
latter
the
noblest
of
dutch
dramas
it
is
the
lucifer
that
we
have
been
asked
to
discuss
did
milton
borrow
from
vondel
the
lucifer
was
published
thirteen
years
before
paradise
lost
the
scheme
of
the
english
poem
had
however
already
been
crystallized
in
the
mind
of
its
author
for
fifteen
years
this
scheme
originally
contemplated
a
drama
which
the
poet
powerful
imagination
gradually
developed
into
an
epic
to
whom
vondel
was
indebted
for
the
foundation
of
his
tremendous
drama
is
easily
ascertained
he
himself
mentions
his
authorities
in
his
admirable
and
learned
preface
among
these
were
besides
the
holy
writ
the
various
church
fathers
the
adamus
exul
of
grotius
the
work
of
du
bartas
and
a
treatise
on
the
fallen
angels
by
the
english
protestant
richard
baker
his
own
imagination
however
soared
far
above
the
fundamental
hints
that
he
received
from
any
of
these
works
on
the
subject
so
that
the
lucifer
is
rightly
considered
one
of
the
most
original
and
comprehensive
poems
in
literature
to
whom
milton
was
indebted
for
the
idea
of
his
great
epic
is
on
the
other
hand
not
so
easy
to
discover
although
generation
after
generation
of
critics
have
thrown
upon
this
problem
the
searchlight
of
innumerable
essays
that
the
paradise
lost
is
scintillant
with
many
of
the
brightest
gems
in
the
crown
of
the
greek
and
latin
classics
is
apparent
even
at
a
cursory
reading
that
it
is
also
studded
with
poetic
paraphrases
of
many
modern
authors
has
often
been
asserted
however
the
opportunity
for
originality
was
colossal
and
imagination
proved
equal
to
the
task
the
conception
of
paradise
lost
alone
makes
it
the
grandest
work
of
the
imagination
of
modern
times
that
the
english
poet
occasionally
borrowed
a
thought
or
a
sentence
can
not
be
doubted
besides
he
had
a
wonderful
memory
long
and
tenacious
which
involuntarily
emptied
its
gatherings
into
the
flow
of
his
thought
and
into
the
stream
of
his
discourse
that
this
was
not
always
done
unconsciously
is
known
from
milton
own
confession
where
he
says
to
borrow
and
to
better
in
the
borrowing
is
no
plagiarie
and
that
he
bettered
in
the
borrowing
who
can
doubt
all
that
he
touched
turned
to
gold
all
that
he
thought
came
out
transfigured
in
the
alembic
of
his
genius
truth
became
beauty
the
mortal
the
immortal
as
the
lucifer
and
the
paradise
lost
are
both
concerning
the
same
subject
and
as
they
are
both
founded
upon
the
biblical
account
of
the
creation
it
is
but
natural
that
they
should
have
much
in
common
a
comparison
of
the
two
poems
therefore
we
feel
sure
would
bring
to
light
some
striking
and
curious
resemblances
and
many
equally
strong
and
remarkable
contrasts
as
such
comparison
would
expand
this
article
beyond
the
prescribed
limits
we
must
leave
it
to
the
reader
himself
nor
should
he
for
one
instant
forget
the
fundamental
difference
between
the
drama
and
the
epic
the
epic
may
wander
through
the
dales
of
arcady
along
slow
meandering
way
to
pluck
the
roses
of
beauty
and
the
lilies
of
sentiment
there
growing
in
so
sweet
abundance
the
drama
with
vigorous
step
and
bold
unerring
eye
pursues
a
straight
path
to
the
of
its
climax
whence
with
increasing
momentum
it
plunges
down
to
its
awful
catastrophe
it
is
the
difference
between
narration
and
action
we
shall
have
to
content
ourselves
therefore
by
a
brief
reference
to
those
who
have
already
given
this
matter
their
attention
that
milton
was
under
great
obligations
to
vondel
drama
has
been
maintained
by
dutch
men
of
letters
for
generations
it
has
also
become
the
contention
of
several
distinguished
english
critics
even
as
far
back
as
the
poet
beddoes
in
a
review
of
hayley
life
and
letters
vol
xxxi
says
an
effect
which
has
hitherto
not
been
noticed
was
then
produced
by
the
dutch
poets
in
their
school
joshua
sylvester
who
lived
amongst
them
learnt
some
of
the
peculiarities
of
his
versification
and
if
milton
was
incited
by
the
perusal
of
any
poem
upon
the
same
subject
to
compose
his
lost
it
was
by
studying
the
and
in
ballingschap
of
vondel
for
he
tried
his
strength
with
the
same
great
poet
in
the
agonistes
vondel
being
indeed
the
only
contemporary
with
whom
he
would
not
have
felt
it
a
degradation
to
vie
edmund
gosse
in
a
brilliant
essay
entitled
milton
and
vondel
was
we
believe
the
first
englishman
who
gave
the
subject
conscientious
study
for
this
on
account
of
his
knowledge
of
the
difficult
dutch
language
he
was
peculiarly
fitted
gosse
in
his
own
interesting
manner
tells
how
during
the
seventeenth
century
the
dutch
then
one
of
the
most
vigorous
languages
of
europe
was
much
more
studied
than
it
is
how
the
patriot
puritan
roger
williams
having
learned
the
language
in
holland
during
his
exile
there
taught
it
to
john
milton
then
cromwell
latin
secretary
how
milton
also
must
have
heard
of
the
great
fame
of
the
lucifer
and
of
the
storm
of
fanatical
opposition
that
greeted
its
publication
from
some
of
the
dutch
diplomats
whom
it
was
his
place
to
entertain
how
too
he
could
hardly
have
been
ignorant
of
the
name
of
the
distinguished
author
of
the
drama
since
it
is
known
that
he
was
well
acquainted
with
hugo
grotius
who
was
a
warm
admirer
and
the
bosom
friend
of
vondel
in
addition
to
these
and
other
reasons
gosse
then
brings
forward
a
plausible
array
of
internal
evidence
showing
many
points
of
similarity
in
the
construction
and
in
the
treatment
of
the
two
poems
summing
up
with
the
conclusion
that
milton
was
undoubtedly
under
considerable
obligation
to
his
great
dutch
contemporary
rev
george
edmundson
of
middlesex
england
a
graduate
of
oxford
in
a
scholarly
and
painstaking
work
of
two
hundred
pages
entitled
milton
and
vondel
a
literary
curiosity
next
took
up
the
subject
carrying
the
comparison
not
only
into
these
two
poems
but
into
all
the
works
of
milton
and
into
several
others
of
vondel
edmundson
also
discovered
many
wonderful
coincidences
and
innumerable
parallelisms
in
phrase
and
in
imagery
inspired
with
the
motto
cuique
he
has
woven
a
tissue
of
most
ingenious
arguments
to
prove
that
milton
borrowed
assiduously
from
the
lucifer
the
adam
the
samson
and
other
works
of
vondel
vance
thompson
in
the
new
york
of
december
has
also
added
some
interesting
data
to
the
subject
with
all
the
conclusions
of
these
gentlemen
we
are
not
yet
however
prepared
to
agree
it
is
true
we
have
not
given
the
matter
the
comparative
study
that
they
have
given
it
we
would
wait
therefore
until
we
had
thought
more
deeply
about
it
before
expressing
our
final
opinion
however
we
believe
that
a
critical
and
impartial
comparison
of
the
two
masterpieces
will
neither
detract
from
the
glory
of
milton
nor
dim
the
grandeur
of
vondel
the
scene
of
the
play
lucifer
is
not
the
story
of
man
first
disobedience
though
this
is
the
outcome
of
the
catastrophe
it
is
the
drama
of
the
fall
of
the
angels
yet
man
is
the
one
subject
of
contention
our
first
parents
are
therefore
kept
in
the
logical
background
of
cause
and
effect
the
creation
of
adam
his
bliss
and
his
growing
eminence
were
the
prime
cause
of
the
angelic
conspiracy
the
effect
of
the
revolt
was
to
the
rebellious
angels
loss
of
heaven
and
to
adam
loss
of
eden
vondel
moreover
follows
the
doctrines
of
certain
theologians
that
christ
would
have
become
man
even
had
adam
not
sinned
like
milton
he
measures
the
scene
of
his
heroic
action
with
the
endless
radius
of
infinitude
and
by
the
artful
use
of
terrestrial
analogies
conveys
to
the
reader
that
idea
of
incomprehensible
vastness
that
the
transcendent
nature
of
the
subject
demands
vondel
is
indeed
even
more
vague
the
drama
not
giving
opportunity
for
detailed
description
both
are
a
wonderful
contrast
to
the
minute
visual
exactness
of
dante
the
attempt
to
reconcile
the
spiritual
qualities
of
the
divine
world
with
the
physical
properties
of
this
necessarily
introduces
some
unavoidable
incongruities
how
can
a
material
conception
of
the
immaterial
be
given
save
through
the
symbols
of
the
real
how
else
can
the
unknown
be
ascertained
save
through
the
equation
of
the
known
how
else
save
by
visual
and
sensuous
images
express
such
impalpable
thought
thus
measuring
things
in
heaven
by
things
on
earth
the
poet
gives
us
a
finite
picture
of
the
infinite
a
picture
which
yet
by
means
of
shadowy
outlines
and
an
artistic
vagueness
impresses
us
with
the
awful
sublimity
of
the
illimitable
and
eternal
the
physical
immensity
of
the
poem
is
unsurpassed
humanized
gods
and
titanic
passions
shadowed
by
fate
upon
the
immaculate
canvas
of
sacred
legend
this
is
the
play
the
personality
of
the
author
is
never
seen
yet
when
we
know
the
man
and
his
life
we
can
not
but
see
therein
the
reflex
of
his
own
experience
the
scene
is
in
heaven
and
never
leaves
it
when
actions
occur
elsewhere
they
are
described
infinities
above
the
scene
of
contention
far
beyond
heaven
blazing
archipelagoes
where
no
imagination
dares
to
soar
reigns
he
before
whose
face
the
universe
with
its
eternity
is
but
a
mote
a
moment
poised
in
space
there
stand
the
hidden
springs
of
life
revealed
the
wondrous
mechanism
from
earth
concealed
there
nature
primal
premises
appear
in
simple
grandeur
deep
and
crystal
clear
flowing
from
out
the
heart
of
boundless
ocean
of
the
eternal
now
with
rapt
devotion
a
myriad
ministering
forces
there
await
the
summons
of
his
awful
eyes
of
fate
the
mandates
of
his
voice
far
far
below
those
empyrean
vaults
is
earth
with
its
pristine
inhabitants
god
and
man
the
creator
and
the
thing
created
the
first
cause
and
the
last
effect
are
both
judiciously
only
introduced
into
the
drama
by
hearsay
deep
in
the
vague
immensity
lies
chaos
the
uninhabited
through
which
the
vanquished
rebels
are
to
be
hurled
to
their
endless
doom
but
the
poet
also
takes
us
where
meteors
glare
and
stormy
glooms
invest
as
leaving
elysium
fields
of
light
he
views
hell
punishments
and
horrors
dire
its
gulfs
of
woe
and
lakes
of
rayless
fire
where
demons
laugh
and
fiends
and
furies
rage
round
writhing
victims
whose
parched
tongues
assuage
no
cooling
drops
of
hope
such
is
the
grand
perspective
from
the
scene
of
this
stupendous
drama
the
peaceful
joys
of
paradise
the
play
opens
as
softly
as
the
opening
strains
of
some
grand
oratorio
the
first
act
is
largely
descriptive
a
picture
of
the
beautiful
serenity
of
heaven
and
of
the
joys
of
paradise
belzebub
the
second
devil
first
comes
on
the
scene
and
as
he
stands
upon
those
heights
flushed
in
creation
morn
by
means
of
a
few
words
vibrant
with
suggestion
and
of
import
he
at
once
gives
us
the
key
to
the
opening
situation
indicating
the
relative
positions
of
the
two
chief
personages
of
the
drama
the
antithesis
of
lucifer
and
adam
apollion
has
been
sent
below
to
gain
some
tidings
of
the
new
race
of
earth
with
speedy
wings
he
soars
back
through
the
blue
crystalline
and
past
the
wondering
spheres
bearing
a
golden
bough
laden
with
choice
fruit
that
apple
sweet
whose
juice
is
wine
of
destiny
he
is
brimming
with
enthusiasm
over
the
wonders
that
he
has
just
witnessed
belzebub
who
has
been
anxiously
awaiting
his
return
listens
intently
to
his
glowing
description
of
the
beauty
of
eden
and
its
primal
innocence
occasionally
interrupting
with
exclamations
of
wonder
question
after
question
suggests
itself
to
his
excited
imagination
at
first
he
is
aflame
with
curiosity
then
jealousy
begins
to
tincture
his
ardor
and
his
admiration
soon
changes
into
mockery
apollion
then
describes
the
primeval
pair
and
their
unalloyed
bliss
and
confesses
that
in
the
delightful
blaze
of
eve
charms
his
snowy
wings
were
singed
indeed
to
curb
his
increasing
desire
he
covered
his
eyes
with
both
hands
and
wings
even
when
godlike
resolution
had
impelled
him
to
return
on
high
he
thrice
turned
back
a
lingering
gaze
towards
the
more
than
seraphic
beauty
of
the
first
woman
far
sweeter
than
even
the
music
of
the
spheres
those
nightingales
of
space
is
this
most
beautiful
note
in
the
song
of
creation
indescribably
delicate
is
his
account
of
the
joys
of
that
first
marriage
and
then
he
kissed
his
bride
and
she
her
bridegroom
thus
on
joy
their
nuptials
fed
on
feasts
of
fiery
love
better
imagined
far
than
told
a
bliss
divine
beyond
all
angel
ken
adding
with
exquisite
pathos
how
poor
our
loneliness
for
us
no
union
sweet
of
sex
of
maiden
and
of
man
alas
how
much
of
good
we
miss
we
know
no
mate
or
happy
marriage
in
a
heaven
devoid
of
woman
with
belzebub
that
mighty
spirit
severely
masculine
it
is
the
growing
power
of
the
new
race
that
furnishes
food
for
thought
and
ground
for
an
ulterior
motive
the
prospect
of
human
rivalry
impresses
him
far
more
than
the
description
of
a
happiness
to
which
the
sexless
angels
must
ever
be
strangers
his
soul
is
keyed
in
a
grander
more
passionless
mood
apollion
however
can
not
forget
this
charming
vision
of
idyllic
joy
he
repeats
the
same
enchanting
strain
again
and
again
he
even
forgets
to
answer
his
chief
questions
and
returns
to
the
same
fascinating
theme
in
their
life
consists
alone
in
loving
and
in
being
loved
one
sweet
one
mutual
joy
by
them
indulged
perpetually
yet
unquenchable
in
this
masterly
manner
the
two
controlling
motives
of
the
play
the
envy
of
man
power
and
the
jealousy
of
human
happiness
are
seen
to
originate
the
latter
however
is
soon
merged
into
the
former
for
apollion
failing
to
elicit
sympathy
with
his
tenderer
emotions
begins
to
sympathize
with
the
more
heroic
mood
of
belzebub
and
even
attempts
to
inflame
it
by
artful
suggestion
the
archangel
gabriel
the
herald
from
the
towering
throne
of
thrones
now
approaches
with
all
the
choristers
of
heaven
to
unfold
the
last
divine
decree
from
the
mouth
of
his
golden
trumpet
fall
the
silvery
tones
of
peace
with
jubilant
tongue
he
praises
the
glorious
attributes
of
the
deity
and
the
boundless
beneficence
of
the
godhead
in
yet
grander
strain
he
prophesies
the
ascent
of
man
who
shall
mount
up
by
the
stairway
of
the
world
the
firmament
of
beatific
light
within
into
the
glow
and
foretells
the
future
incarnation
of
the
son
of
god
who
on
his
high
seat
in
his
unshadowed
realm
shall
judge
both
men
and
angels
here
the
chorus
after
the
manner
of
the
antique
drama
bursts
into
a
line
of
pious
affirmation
gabriel
then
continues
his
address
in
a
sterner
tone
obedience
to
the
divine
command
and
honor
to
the
new
race
is
henceforth
the
bounden
duty
of
the
angelic
hosts
then
follows
a
description
of
the
three
hierarchies
of
heaven
founded
upon
the
doctrine
of
the
church
fathers
ending
with
an
eloquent
iteration
of
the
divine
command
as
yet
all
is
serene
even
those
spirits
who
soon
shall
unfurl
the
black
banner
of
rebellion
in
that
virgin
realm
of
peace
are
yet
unaware
that
within
their
breasts
slumbers
a
passion
that
awaking
will
fill
those
holy
courts
with
the
tumultuous
discord
of
revolt
the
ringing
echoes
of
gabriel
clarion
trumpet
have
scarcely
died
away
when
throughout
the
clear
hyaline
millions
of
angelic
choristers
burst
into
that
sublime
hymn
of
praise
that
anthem
sung
to
harps
of
gold
the
grandest
ever
penned
who
is
it
on
his
throne
triumphant
songs
and
glad
hosannahs
now
float
down
those
arching
voids
of
empyrean
stair
all
that
pleaseth
god
is
well
is
the
devout
conclusion
of
this
splendid
outburst
of
celestial
praise
harmony
harmony
and
with
this
glorious
ode
of
jubilation
the
act
comes
to
an
end
the
cloud
of
conspiracy
in
the
second
act
the
protagonist
first
comes
on
the
scene
like
a
god
with
thunder
shod
crowned
with
the
stars
and
with
the
morning
stoled
he
has
until
now
been
artfully
kept
in
the
background
drawn
by
cherubim
he
sweeps
into
view
and
voices
in
no
uncertain
tone
his
dissatisfaction
with
the
divine
decree
gabriel
the
angel
of
revelation
is
with
admirable
art
now
placed
over
against
the
stadtholder
lucifer
would
argue
would
know
the
exact
nature
of
heaven
last
decree
gabriel
however
merely
replies
to
his
eager
questioning
with
a
dignified
affirmation
of
god
command
and
departs
leaving
the
divine
injunction
behind
belzebub
with
untiring
malignity
now
prods
the
wounded
pride
of
the
fiery
stadtholder
and
lucifer
again
and
again
blazes
into
the
most
intense
and
bitter
defiance
listen
to
this
speech
seething
with
the
soul
of
rebellion
now
swear
i
by
my
crown
upon
this
chance
to
venture
all
to
raise
my
seat
amid
the
firmament
the
spheres
the
splendor
of
the
stars
above
the
heaven
of
heavens
shall
then
my
palace
be
the
rainbow
be
my
throne
the
starry
vast
my
court
while
down
beneath
the
earth
shall
be
my
and

i
shall
then
swiftly
drawn
through

on
a
chariot
of
cloud
with
and
thunder
grind
to
dust

below

us
oppose
were
it

grand
himself
yea
we
yield
these
empyrean
vaults
proud
in
their
towering
masonry
shall
burst
with
all
their
airy
arches
and
dissolve
before
our
eyes
this
huge
and
earth
like
a
misshapen
monster
lifeless
lie
this
wondrous
universe
to
chaos
fall
and
to
its
primal
desolation
change
who
dares
who
dares
defy
great
lucifer
surely
the
spirit
of
revolt
never
found
fiercer
and
more
poetical
expression
surely
more
eloquent
and
stupendous
daring
was
never
uttered
than
the
blasting
fulminations
of
this
celestial
rebel
who
now
stands
like
a
colossus
of
evil
in
the
realm
of
good
the
leaders
of
the
conspiracy
then
meet
together
and
hatch
their
deep
nefarious
plot
lucifer
towers
magnificent
the
controlling
spirit
in
every
plan
full
of
impelling
thought
and
of
tremendous
action
apollion
that
master
wit
with
craftiness
the
spirits
to
seduce
and

whose
countenance
with
dissimulation
hue
knows
no
superior
in
deception
at
lucifer
command
now
sow
the
seeds
of
dissension
broadcast
throughout
the
heavens
the
dialogue
between
these
two
celestial
rogues
shows
great
dramatic
skill
and
abounds
in
subtleties
worthy
of
the
chief
himself
their
whole
plan
seems
to
be
through
something
specious
some
seeming
guised
to
win
first
the
various
chiefs
and
then
the
bravest
warriors
to
the
standard
of
the
and
then
with
these
for
all

mankind
to
lock
without
the
gate
of
heaven
a
resolve
that
tinkles
well
in
the
angelic
ear
and
flashes
like
a
flame
from
choir
to
choir
the
chorus
of
good
angels
again
comes
on
the
stage
and
with
antiphonal
harmonies
reveals
the
growing
discontent
how
eloquently
it
pictures
the
serene
beauties
of
heaven
now
tarnished
with
mournful
mists
from
darkness
driven
a
beautiful
and
poetic
synthesis
of
the
preceding
act
the
gathering
gloom
in
the
third
act
the
heavens
are
in
a
blaze
of
uproar
the
rebellion
is
now
widespread
and
revolution
is
imminent
the
whole
act
is
one
grand
antithesis
of
the
loyal
and
the
seditious
angels
or
luciferians
as
the
latter
are
called
it
is
strophe
and
nearly
all
the
way
through
it
is
argument
and
from
beginning
to
end
with
wonderful
art
our
sympathy
for
the
rank
and
file
of
the
rebellious
spirits
is
first
awakened
one
is
made
to
feel
that
their
disaffection
is
genuine
and
that
their
sorrow
is
unaffected
they
represent
the
dissatisfied
people
brought
to
the
verge
of
frenzy
by
the
wily
arts
of
the
demagogue
the
howling
mob
wanting
only
the
kindling
spark
to
flash
into
the
flame
of
revolt
the
maddened
rabble
waiting
for
the
to
spur
them
into
open
revolution
and
the
appears
belzebub
by
his
colossal
hypocrisy
and
diabolical
cunning
succeeds
in
drawing
them
into
an
incriminating
attitude
michael
austere
and
magnificent
approaches
at
this
crisis
and
these
two
chiefs
are
then
thrown
into
admirable
juxtaposition
michael
grandeur
has
already
been
foreshadowed
and
his
character
in
every
way
equals
the
conception
of
him
that
we
were
led
to
form
like
lucifer
he
is
preëminently
the
incarnation
of
action
he
will
not
argue
he
does
not
appeal
he
is
a
god
of
battle
not
a
divinity
of
words
he
is
stern
and
powerful
he
is
terse
and
terribly
severe
and
after
a
few
words
full
of
scathing
scorn
and
ominous
with
threat
he
commands
the
virtuous
angels
to
part
at
once
from
the
rebellious
horde
he
then
leaves
to
learn
the
will
of
the
most
high
the
disappearance
of
michael
is
the
signal
for
the
advent
of
the
head
of
the
rebellion
himself
lucifer
now
comes
opportunely
to
the
front
with
great
art
the
meeting
of
the
and
the
stadtholder
has
been
avoided
such
a
meeting
would
have
brought
about
a
premature
crisis
the
luciferians
in
a
splendid
burst
of
appeal
beg
the
protection
to
this
appeal
lucifer
replies
in
a
speech
that
is
sublime
in
its
hypocrisy
he
professes
blind
attachment
to
god
and
proceeds
to
test
their
sincerity
by
skillfully
opposing
questions
of
prudence
and
arguments
of
peace
while
at
the
same
time
he
admits
apparently
with
great
reluctance
that
their
grievances
are
well
founded
he
hopes
too
that
their
displeasure
will
not
be
accounted
as
a
stain
on
high
and
that
god
will
forgive
their
righteous
resentment
when
however
he
discovers
that
they
are
firm
in
their
determination
to
obtain
their
rights
by
force
of
arms
that
they
sincerely
desire
him
as
their
chief
and
that
at
least
of
all
the
spirits
are
already
numbered
among
the
rebels
he
throws
off
his
mask
and
quickly
changes
front
then
shall
we
venture
all
our
favor
lost
to
the
oppressors
of
your
lawful
right
he
now
again
appears
as
the
imperious
prince
of
revolt
and
at
belzebub
solicitation
mounts
the
throne
which
the
latter
has
meanwhile
prepared
for
him
belzebub
enjoins
the
hosts
to
swear
allegiance
to
lucifer
and
to
his
which
oath
is
given
with
a
will
and
the
act
is
at
an
end
the
chorus
of
luciferians
then
extol
their
leader
in
an
ode
breathing
defiance
and
blazing
with
the
flame
of
rebellion
the
clanging
tread
of
a
mailed
warrior
resounds
in
every
line
the
note
of
triumph
rings
out
boldly
and
with
professions
of
fealty
to
their
chief
and
kindling
with
adoration
for
his
they
march
off
the
stage
this
ode
is
a
curious
medley
of
antique
metres
trochees
dactyls
and
spondees
attuned
to
tumultuous
emotion
boldly
regular
in
its
classic
irregularity
it
echoes
and
with
the
clamor
of
battle
and
the
shout
of
revelry
it
is
a
pæan
keyed
in
the
strident
chord
of
hell
scarcely
have
these
fiercely
jubilant
tones
died
away
when
the
good
angels
follow
with
a
plaintive
ode
of
sorrow
that
is
a
striking
antithesis
to
the
passionate
outburst
of
hate
with
which
the
air
is
yet
reverberating
strophe
and
antistrophe
proceed
in
the
same
mournful
iambic
measure
in
verses
sweetly
musical
with
curious
rimes
when
suddenly
in
the
epode
they
break
into
a
livelier
strain
and
in
tripping
trochaics
give
voice
to
an
entirely
different
mood
a
fiery
indignation
mingled
with
a
deep
sense
of
the
grave
crisis
that
threatens
the
autonomy
of
heaven
here
too
is
a
foreshadowing
of
the
transcendent
power
that
shall
quell
this
treason
nothing
can
be
more
original
and
artistic
than
these
lyrics
themselves
nothing
can
be
more
harmonious
than
their
blending
with
the
action
vondel
is
never
more
admirable
than
here
the
seething
seas
of
sedition
in
the
fourth
act
the
rebellion
has
become
a
conflagration
the
whole
of
heaven
glows
with
the
fierce
blaze
of
tumult
and
of
treachery
gabriel
winged
with
command
comes
on
the
scene
and
orders
michael
in
the
name
of
god
to
burn
out
with
a
glow
of
fire
and
zeal
these
dark
polluting
stains
michael
is
astounded
to
learn
of
the
treachery
of
lucifer
and
in
reply
to
his
inquiries
gabriel
gives
a
beautiful
and
pathetic
account
of
the
progress
of
the
revolt
and
tells
how
the
radiant
joy
of
god
became
overshadowed
with
mournfulness
michael
now
summons
uriel
his
to
his
side
and
at
once
proceeds
to
put
on
his
armor
at
the
same
time
shouting
his
orders
to
his
myriad
legions
around
him
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
celestial
host
stands
in
marching
array
and
is
rapidly
hurried
forward
we
are
now
transported
into
the
hostile
camp
where
lucifer
is
seen
questioning
his
generals
as
to
the
number
and
the
disposition
of
his
forces
belzebub
replies
with
a
lucid
and
highly
colored
report
saying
that
the
deserters
sweep
onward
with
a
rush
and
roar
from
every
firmament
like
a
vast
sea
aglow
with
radiant
lights
lucifer
is
much
pleased
to
learn
this
and
from
his
throne
addresses
his
flaming
squadrons
in
a
speech
bristling
with
warlike
reason
and
full
of
indomitable
courage
he
fully
apprehends
the
enormity
of
his
offense
and
cunningly
makes
his
hearers
equal
sharers
in
his
guilt
retreat
is
now
impossible
the
celestial
rubicon
is
crossed
they
have
already
burnt
all
bridges
behind
them
necessity
therefore
he
says
must
be
our
law
if
defeated
god
himself
can
not
wholly
annihilate
them
while
if
they
chance
to
win
the
hated
tyranny
of
heaven
shall
then
be
changed
into
a
state
of
freedom
nor
shall
the
angels
then
be
forced
to
pant
beneath
the
yoke
of
servitude
forever
once
more
he
demands
the
oath
of
allegiance
and
is
about
to
give
the
command
forward
when
belzebub
espies
the
beautiful
figure
of
rafael
winging
his
golden
way
trough
the
crystal
empyrean
on
a
mission
of
mercy
even
belzebub
is
touched
at
this
sign
of
angelic
affection
and
his
tone
usually
so
sarcastic
and
so
severely
deliberate
as
he
announces
his
advent
is
softened
to
a
transient
tenderness
for
once
he
has
forgotten
his
usual
mocking
air
and
this
exquisite
touch
does
much
to
relieve
the
sombre
impression
of
his
tremendous
malignity
rafael
a
celestial
john
melting
with
love
for
the
stadtholder
falls
in
a
paroxysm
of
grief
and
tenderness
upon
his
neck
we
intuitively
feel
that
some
secret
bond
of
sympathy
must
bind
these
two
angels
so
dissimilar
in
spirit
and
in
character
together
lucifer
overwhelming
in
passion
gigantic
in
intellect
resistless
in
will
magnificent
in
his
whole
personality
rafael
sublime
in
devotion
infinite
in
pity
immaculate
in
holiness
the
apotheosis
of
all
that
is
beautiful
lucifer
whose
eyes
flash
ambition
and
whose
heart
flames
hate
rafael
whose
gaze
is
aspiration
and
whose
soul
is
love
the
genius
of
evil
and
the
spirit
of
virtue
the
proudly
wicked
and
the
meekly
good
the
infernal
masculine
stands
confronted
by
the
heavenly
feminine
harsh
violence
is
caressed
by
loving
gentleness
and
pride
and
humility
embrace
truly
a
masterly
antithesis
in
a
strain
of
glorious
appeal
rafael
begs
lucifer
to
desist
and
first
aims
at
the
weakest
point
in
his
armor
his
pride
how
splendid
his
description
of
lucifer
glory
his
former
pomp
is
here
artistically
pictured
to
heighten
the
contrast
with
his
fall
he
next
proceeds
to
threaten
and
gives
an
equally
vivid
picture
of
the
horrible
punishments
the
worm
endless
remorse
and
pain
reserved
for
him
he
then
offers
his
olive
branch
as
a
token
of
divine
mercy
and
urges
immediate
acceptance
before
it
is
forever
too
late
truth
offers
hope
to
error
on
the
to
despair
peace
pours
her
golden
offering
at
the
iron
feet
of
war
lucifer
proud
in
his
consciousness
of
strength
as
the
chosen
head
of
millions
of
angelic
warriors
of
the
entire
spirit
world
is
however
unmoved
he
asseverates
that
he
merely
wishes
to
uphold
the
ancient
charter
the
standard
of
revolt
is
also
the
banner
of
right
duty
has
called
justice
commanded
friendship
inspired
him
to
take
this
step
for
the
protection
of
the
celestial
fatherland
he
too
then
with
necessity
the
tyrant
plea
excused
his
devilish
deeds
hear
his
own
words
i
shall
maintain
the
holy
right
compelled
by
high
necessity
thus
urged
at
length
though
much
against
my
will
by
the
complaints
and
mournful
groans
of
myriad
tongues
rafael
stands
aghast
at
the
picture
of
such
hardened
wickedness
his
hairs
rise
with
fear
to
hear
the
archangel
shameless
confession
and
he
promptly
accuses
him
of
ambition
and
of
gross
deceit
lucifer
however
indignantly
denies
this
and
proudly
asserts
that
he
has
always
done
his
full
duty
rafael
then
reads
aloud
his
evil
purpose
as
it
is
written
in
lurid
letters
on
his
heart
the
astonished
chief
no
longer
denies
his
lust
for
power
but
claims
the
prerogative
of
his
position
as
the
stadtholder
of
god
at
last
he
is
brought
to
the
acknowledgment
that
the
ascent
of
man
is
the
stone
upon
which
his
shall
whet
its
edge
rafael
like
an
angel
of
light
then
pleads
with
this
spirit
of
darkness
in
tones
of
sweetest
tenderness
he
stands
here
like
a
personified
conscience
he
would
be
the
guardian
angel
of
the
great
stadtholder
not
a
harsh
word
escapes
the
stern
lips
of
the
flaming
archangel
his
own
vast
knowledge
and
his
deep
heart
testify
how
good
are
the
intentions
of
his
friend
what
visions
are
here
called
up
of
the
happy
days
of
their
friendship
when
they
basked
in
the
untarnished
splendors
of
heaven
before
a
thought
of
evil
had
tolled
the
funeral
knell
of
peace
argument
after
argument
in
cumulative
progression
falls
from
the
pleader
mellifluous
tongue
lucifer
is
stern
and
unyielding
still
rafael
pleads
on
for
an
instant
lucifer
falters
rafael
sees
his
advantage
and
not
only
again
offers
him
his
olive
branch
but
appoints
himself
as
lucifer
hostage
with
god
so
sure
is
he
of
obtaining
mercy
lucifer
is
almost
overcome
but
the
thought
of
his
setting
in
shame
and
darkness
and
a
vision
of
his
enemies
defiant
on
the
throne
still
steels
his
heart
in
its
obstinate
resolve
rafael
next
pictures
for
him
in
lurid
colors
the
lake
of
brimstone
down
below
whose
mouth
yawns
for
his
destruction
once
more
for
the
third
time
he
offers
the
archrebel
the
branch
of
peace
and
promises
full
grace
lucifer
then
gives
voice
to
that
grand
soliloquy
beginning
what
creature
else
so
wretched
is
as
i
on
the
one
side
flicker
feeble
rays
of
hope
while
on
the
other
yawns
a
flaming
horror
here
he
reveals
for
the
first
time
his
inmost
heart
this
is
the
crisis
of
his
career
the
climax
of
the
whole
play
nowhere
is
the
suspense
so
keen
one
wonders
how
the
archangel
will
decide
in
this
critical
moment
this
brevity
twixt
bliss
and
endless
doom
his
pride
of
will
has
in
one
stroke
become
a
chaos
of
indecision
we
are
made
to
sympathize
with
his
terrible
anguish
as
the
logic
of
his
conscience
leads
him
to
the
bitter
adversative
but
is
too
late
all
hope
is
past
the
ominous
sound
of
michael
battle
trumpet
rudely
awakes
him
from
his
revery
and
forces
him
to
the
stern
realization
of
the
impending
strife
just
at
this
moment
also
apollion
soars
into
his
presence
with
the
news
of
the
near
approach
of
god
lucifer
however
is
as
yet
too
agitated
so
soon
after
his
sudden
apprehension
of
the
enormity
of
his
crime
and
of
the
terrible
punishment
reserved
for
him
in
the
probable
event
of
his
defeat
to
respond
with
alacrity
to
the
summons
it
is
with
great
difficulty
that
he
rouses
himself
from
his
soliloquizing
mood
he
must
think
but
although
he
feels
far
more
than
his
followers
that
the
heavy
bolt
of
war
should
not
be
weighed
too
lightly
and
although
he
well
knows
that
the
odds
are
against
him
he
has
by
the
time
that
his
other
chieftains
approach
quite
recovered
himself
and
at
once
gives
the
quick
sharp
command
of
the
soldier
the
time
for
action
has
come
behind
their
towering
leader
amid
the
blare
of
bugles
and
the
trumpet
stirring
tones
his
serried
battalions
march
with
waving
banners
off
the
stage
of
this
busy
scene
rafael
meanwhile
has
been
a
silent
but
interested
spectator
now
alone
in
his
sorrow
he
melts
into
a
compassionate
monologue
and
joined
by
the
chorus
gives
utterance
to
that
beautiful
lyric
of
grief
that
tender
prayer
so
full
of
the
sweet
melody
of
appeal
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
act
amid
the
jarring
clamor
and
the
frenzied
shout
of
the
departing
squadrons
this
anthem
of
mercy
rises
to
god
like
a
benediction
over
the
passion
waves
of
the
tumultuous
hell
of
rebellion
around
them
their
voices
tremble
like
the
echoes
of
a
heaven
forever
lost
surely
the
emotion
of
forgiving
compassion
was
never
combined
with
a
more
musical
sorrow
here
as
in
all
of
vondel
lyrics
there
is
a
perfect
harmony
between
the
form
and
the
thought
flood
and
flame
at
the
opening
of
the
last
act
rafael
is
discovered
on
the
battlements
of
heaven
he
is
in
a
fever
of
anxiety
to
learn
the
result
of
the
contest
and
peers
into
the
empyrean
for
some
sign
of
a
messenger
from
the
field
where
armies
reel
on
slopes
with
lightning
crowned
the
glad
sounds
of
approaching
triumph
fall
on
his
ear
across
the
pure
hyaline
now
dart
meteoric
flashes
of
light
each
shield
of
the
victorious
legions
dazzles
like
a
sun
each
streams
a
day
of
triumph
forth
far
in
advance
of
the
returning
battalions
speeds
uriel
angel
with
swiftest
wing
bearing
the
message
of
victory
with
incredible
velocity
for
he
is
winged
with
good
news
he
flashes
through
the
air
in
his
aery
wheels
exultingly
waving
his
flaming
keen
sword
he
has
reached
the
serene
altitude
of
heaven
he
has
gained
the
farthest
wall
he
is
at
hand
rafael
is
full
of
eagerness
to
hear
the
details
of
the
fight
the
particulars
of
this
the
first
campaign
in
heaven
uriel
then
with
sequence
just
gives
a
vivid
account
of
the
preparations
for
battle
beginning
with
the
moment
when
gabriel
first
informed
michael
of
the
defection
of
the
stadtholder
he
tells
how
the
countless
loyal
legions
at
their
chief
command
deploy
themselves
in
battle
line
until
they
form
in
serried
rank
one
firm
trilateral
host
that
like
a
triangle
thrust
out
its
edges
sharp
upon
the
eye
michael
the
stands
in
the
heart
of
this
triangle
towering
high
above
his
fellows
the
personification
of
judgment
with
the
glow
of
lurid
lightnings
in
his
lifted
hand
splendid
is
the
picture
of
the
infernal
host
their
squadrons
battalion
on
battalion
riders
pale
on
dim
mysterious
chargers
advance
in
the
form
of
a
crescent
moon
belzebub
and
belial
command
the
two
horns
of
this
formidable
array
both
standing
there
in
shining
panoply
vying
in
splendors
grand
lucifer
himself
holds
the
centre
the
point
strategic
of
his
army
while
apollion
behind
him
bears
on
high
the
lofty
standard
with
its
streaming
rafael
in
his
excitement
occasionally
interrupts
this
graphic
description
with
exclamations
of
wonder
and
as
the
story
of
the
terrible
conflict
progresses
also
with
occasional
cries
of
horror
and
of
pity
great
art
is
shown
in
the
introduction
of
these
exclamatory
pauses
into
the
long
account
of
the
battle
scene
it
not
only
gives
the
narrator
time
to
get
breath
but
voices
the
feelings
of
the
listener
and
intensifies
his
suspense
then
follows
a
brilliant
account
of
the
stadtholder
as
the
rebel
chief
is
the
protagonist
and
as
the
seditious
angels
furnish
the
subject
matter
for
the
drama
the
poet
has
artistically
described
them
at
great
length
at
last
the
two
armies
confront
each
other
we
are
now
made
to
see
how
they
panted
for
strife
and
for
destruction
flamed
then
follows
the
famous
battle
scene
which
must
be
read
in
the
own
thrilling
words
here
is
action
in
every
line
a
battle
stroke
in
each
word
after
the
first
onset
the
celestial
legions
begin
by
circling
wheels
to
soar
aloft
whence
like
a
falcon
they
shall
soon
precipitate
themselves
upon
their
enemies
who
having
also
risen
but
with
heavier
sail
are
likened
to
a
flock
of
drowsing
herons
thrown
into
sudden
consternation
by
the
sight
of
their
dreaded
foe
uriel
now
gives
a
striking
picture
of
the
grand
perspective
above
the
celestial
legions
high
in
the
empyrean
arrayed
like
a
shining
triangle
the
symbol
of
the
trinity
far
beneath
the
infernal
phalanx
gleaming
like
a
crescent
on
the
turbaned
brow
of
night
the
sign
of
the
turk
whose
ferocious
hordes
even
in
vondel
time
were
yet
thundering
at
the
gate
of
christendom
thus
each
army
hangs
suspended
like
a
silent
cloud
full
weighted
the
balanced
air
again
the
celestial
triangle
with
terrific
force
crashes
into
the
infernal
and
flames
of
brimstone
red
and
blue
flash
far
out
into
the
sky
thunderbolt
on
thunderbolt
unchained
leap
with
angry
roar
into
the
surging
horde
leaving
havoc
ruin
and
desolation
in
their
lurid
wake
the
centre
of
the
begins
to
break
and
its
pointed
horns
nearly
meet
together
behind
the
resistless
triangle
lucifer
performs
wonderful
feats
of
valor
high
on
his
blazing
chariot
he
is
a
conspicuous
figure
his
fierce
team
the
lion
and
the
dragon
blue
symbolic
of
pride
and
envy
enraged
by
the
rained
upon
their
starry
backs
fly
forward
with
fearful
strides
the
lion
with
dreadful
bellows
biting
and
rending
while
his
terrible
mate
shoots
poisons
from
his
frothy
tongue
and
raving
fills
the
air
with
smoke
blown
from
his
nostrils
far
and
wide
on
every
side
the
infernal
chief
is
surrounded
by
his
enemies
they
try
to
overpower
him
with
mere
numbers
he
parries
every
stroke
or
breaks
their
force
upon
his
shield
he
then
waves
his
aloft
to
fell
god
glowing
banner
when
michael
clad
in
glittering
armor
like
a
god
amid
a
ring
of
suns
suddenly
confronts
him
the
archangel
sternly
calls
upon
the
rebel
prince
to
surrender
but
lucifer
unmoved
three
times
with
his
strives
to
cleave
the
diamond
shield
of
michael
wherein
blazed
god
most
holy
name
the
axe
rebounds
and
shivers
into
fragments
and
we
can
not
but
sympathize
with
the
archrebel
who
is
now
in
a
bad
plight
indeed
the
grand
catastrophe
to
which
the
swift
current
of
his
wickedness
has
been
bearing
him
is
at
last
at
hand
reserved
with
consummate
art
until
the
middle
of
this
act
michael
lifts
his
terrible
right
hand
and
through
the
helmet
and
head
of
his
disarmed
but
yet
unconquered
foe
he
smites
his
lightnings
cleaving
unto
his
very
eyes
the
force
of
this
blow
is
such
that
lucifer
is
hurled
from
his
chariot
which
follows
him
downward
whirling
round
and
round
in
its
descent
thus
lion
dragon
driver
all
plunge
down
in
vain
the
fierce
swarms
of
warring
rebels
attempt
to
stay
their
chief
uriel
engages
apollion
and
succeeds
in
wresting
from
him
the
rebel
banner
with
its
belzebub
and
belial
still
fight
on
but
their
legions
are
all
confused
the
crescent
has
now
become
a
disorganized
mob
and
them
fell
destruction
rolls
its
flood
in
vain
apollion
comes
back
into
the
field
reinforced
by
the
monsters
from
the
firmament
of
heaven
which
may
be
supposed
to
typify
as
vondel
says
in
his
preface
the
abuse
of
the
forces
of
nature
by
the
devil
to
effect
his
evil
designs
orion
shrieking
until
the
very
air
grows
faint
strives
to
crush
the
head
of
the
assault
that
heedless
of
orion
or
his
club
moves
grandly
on
the
northern
bears
stand
upon
their
haunches
to
oppose
their
brutish
strength
the
hydra
gapes
with
throats
but
unmindful
of
all
these
the
triangle
still
advances
numerous
other
episodes
in
the
meanwhile
are
happening
along
the
line
of
battle
but
the
suspense
is
at
last
over
the
victory
of
the
celestial
angels
is
a
glorious
fact
rafael
now
gives
utterance
to
exclamations
of
praise
and
asks
uriel
concerning
the
effect
of
his
defeat
on
the
fallen
archangel
uriel
then
recounts
his
terrible
punishment
and
relates
how
his
splendid
beauty
was
now
become
in
falling
a
complication
of
seven
dreadful
monsters
typifying
the
seven
deadly
sins
that
beast
says
the
narrator
doth
shrink
to
view
its
own
deformity
and
veils
with
darkling
mists
its
gorgon
face
the
fate
of
the
protagonist
being
known
rafael
next
wishes
to
learn
what
became
of
the
rest
of
the
rebel
host
then
follows
the
account
of
the
tumultuous
rout
wherein
the
fleeing
hordes
in
their
descent
to
hell
also
undergo
a
metamorphosis
into
the
forms
of
strange
and
uncouth
monsters
at
this
point
the
triumphant
michael
himself
approaches
with
his
victorious
legions
laden
with
glorious
plunder
the
celestial
choristers
strewing
their
laurel
leaves
accompanied
by
the
sound
of
cymbal
pipe
and
drum
now
greet
him
with
a
song
of
jubilation
which
even
more
than
most
of
vondel
lyrics
is
peculiar
for
the
intricacy
of
its
rimes
hail
to
the
hero
hail
they
cry
the
spirit
and
liveliness
of
this
pæan
are
eminently
suited
to
voice
the
long
plaudits
of
the
angels
the
regularity
of
this
ode
with
its
rapid
melodious
swing
is
a
marked
contrast
to
the
strident
enthusiasm
and
the
discordant
harmony
of
the
chorus
of
luciferians
at
the
end
of
act
iii
as
soon
as
the
joyful
reverberations
of
the
have
ceased
to
roll
through
the
interminable
arches
on
high
michael
addresses
his
legions
and
the
assembled
hosts
in
a
speech
of
great
dignity
ascribing
the
glory
of
the
victory
to
god
alone
he
speaks
proudly
of
the
spoils
of
battle
which
have
already
been
hung
on
the
bright
axis
of
heaven
no
more
shall
we
says
he
behold
the
glow
of
majesty
supreme
dimmed
by
the
damp
of
base
ingratitude
he
next
pictures
the
defeated
rebels
as
all
blind
and
overcast
with
shrouding
mists
and
horribly
deformed
then
he
concludes
with
stern
sententiousness
thus
is
his
fate
who
would
assail
god
throne
which
the
choristers
as
gravely
repeat
the
expected
catastrophe
has
occurred
and
the
terrible
conclusion
has
been
described
in
the
stormy
wake
of
the
sad
fall
of
the
angels
follows
the
no
less
sad
fall
of
man
the
loss
of
the
primal
innocence
eden
bowers
the
heaving
seething
seas
of
rebellion
swollen
to
the
skies
have
it
is
true
subsided
but
again
they
gather
momentum
for
one
more
wave
of
disaster
which
now
breaks
upon
the
shore
of
earth
spreading
death
and
desolation
throughout
the
sinless
groves
of
paradise
for
gabriel
now
approaches
and
hurls
into
the
joyful
camp
a
thunderbolt
of
sad
surprise
alas
alas
he
cries
breaking
into
lamentation
our
triumph
is
in
vain
and
he
announces
the
fall
of
adam
michael
is
astounded
and
shudders
as
he
hears
the
news
with
infinite
distress
he
listens
to
gabriel
interesting
account
of
how
the
overthrow
was
effected
gabriel
first
describes
the
dim
infernal
consistory
far
far
below
here
lucifer
called
together
all
his
chieftains
who
now
unto
each
other
turned
abhorring
gaze
then
his
councillors
of
state
the
archfiend
whose
character
is
now
shown
in
its
full
development
addressed
his
followers
in
words
full
of
bitter
rage
against
god
a
striking
contrast
to
the
dignity
of
michael
address
his
heart
is
now
a
hell
of
hate
boiling
with
passion
for
revenge
the
heavens
must
be
persecuted
and
circumvented
and
this
must
be
done
by
the
ruin
of
man
with
prophetic
eye
he
pictures
his
future
dominion
on
earth
and
the
myriad
miseries
into
which
the
fall
shall
plunge
mankind
he
then
promises
his
the
future
adoration
of
the
human
race
when
as
heathen
gods
and
pagan
deities
they
shall
receive
the
praise
of
countless
multitudes
of
men
at
this
point
michael
breaks
into
fierce
execrations
making
a
vow
of
summary
and
condign
punishment
gabriel
then
continues
to
relate
how
lucifer
selected
belial
as
the
most
worthy
instrument
to
seduce
the
happy
pair
belial
taking
upon
himself
the
form
of
the
serpent
succeeds
most
fiendishly
in
his
unholy
mission
first
as
in
the
biblical
account
alluring
eve
who
in
turn
tempts
adam
their
fall
and
shame
and
misery
are
pathetically
told
in
the
midst
of
this
sad
story
the
chorus
interjects
its
wail
of
sympathy
while
gabriel
continues
by
narrating
the
colloquy
of
the
hapless
twain
with
god
gabriel
then
gives
the
woeful
details
of
their
penalty
and
presents
a
dismal
picture
of
future
wretchedness
against
the
blackness
of
which
however
is
one
bright
star
the
promise
of
the
strong
one
the
hero
who
shall
crush
the
serpent
head
gabriel
now
commands
michael
to
place
all
things
in
their
wonted
place
lest
the
malicious
spirits
should
further
mischief
brew
michael
the
spirit
of
eternal
order
then
proceeds
to
reduce
this
chaos
of
evil
to
final
subjection
he
first
sends
uriel
down
to
drive
the
pair
from
eden
who
have
dared
transgress
so
rash
and
blind
the
primal
law
his
duty
it
is
also
to
force
mankind
to
labor
sweat
and
arduous
slavery
he
is
furthermore
to
act
as
sentinel
over
the
garden
and
over
the
tree
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
ozias
is
enjoined
to
capture
and
securely
bind
the
host
of
the
infernal
animals
with
the
lion
and
the
dragon
who
so
furiously
raged
against
the
standard
of
heaven
listen
to
this
stern
command
sweep
from
the
sky
these
hordes
accursed
and
bind
them
neck
and
claw
and
chain
them
forcibly
azarias
is
entrusted
with
the
key
of
the
bottomless
abyss
wherein
he
is
commanded
to
lock
all
that
assail
the
powers
of
heaven
to
maceda
is
given
the
torch
to
light
the
sulphurous
lake
down
in
the
centre
of
the
earth
wherein
lucifer
the
protagonist
with
poetic
justice
so
near
the
scene
of
his
last
flagrant
crime
is
doomed
to
endless
solitary
torment
there
in
the
eternal
fire
unquenchable
with
chilling
frosts
commingled
amid
the
bitter
blast
of
memory
regret
to
suffer
the
throes
of
ten
thousand
hells
and
to
discover
how
slow
time
limps
upon
a
crutch
of
pain
through
an
eternity
of
keen
remorse
for
the
last
time
the
chorus
comes
on
the
stage
echoing
in
a
brief
epilogue
the
one
silvery
voice
of
hope
that
speaks
from
that
dark
conclusion
of
multitudinous
despair
it
too
gives
promise
of
a
brighter
dawn
wherein
the
grand
deliverer
shall
cleanse
fallen
man
of
the
foul
taint
original
opening
for
him
a
fairer
paradise
on
high
where
the
thrones
made
vacant
by
the
fall
of
the
angels
shall
as
in
cædmon
be
filled
by
the
glorified
souls
of
the
children
of
men
thus
the
spectator
is
left
attuned
to
the
triumph
of
christ
in
the
promised
reconciliation
and
the
work
of
redemption
is
made
complete
in
this
noble
ending
evil
though
not
annihilated
is
controlled
the
good
is
victorious
and
heaven
is
once
more
restored
to
its
pristine
holiness
the
fallen
angels
the
imperious
lords
of
heaven
have
been
succeeded
by
the
lowly
third
estate
the
human
worms
whom
they
so
much
despised
thus
here
too
revolution
has
proved
progression
the
storm
of
war
has
ceased
and
above
the
sky
shines
the
glorious
rainbow
of
peace
the
lucifer
as
a
drama
like
all
of
vondel
dramas
the
lucifer
is
after
the
greek
model
and
surely
that
model
was
never
inspiration
for
a
more
splendid
tragedy
vondel
idea
of
the
classic
drama
was
derived
from
the
close
study
of
the
ancients
and
their
modern
dutch
commentators
heinsius
vossius
grotius
barlæus
and
other
latinists
of
renown
the
lucifer
is
a
tragedy
after
chaucer
own
heart
tragedis
is
to
sayn
a
certeyn
storie
as
olde
bokes
maken
us
memorie
of
hem
that
stood
in
greet
prosperité
and
is
yfallen
out
of
heigh
degree
into
miserie
and
endith
wrecchedly
there
is
no
death
no
blood
no
murder
it
is
the
drama
of
a
magnificent
ruin
the
action
of
the
play
pursuing
the
straight
track
of
one
controlling
purpose
and
moving
with
terrible
majesty
to
the
goal
of
an
inevitable
destiny
also
makes
it
a
tragedy
in
the
larger
dramatic
sense
the
wonderful
characterization
and
the
overpowering
ethical
motive
also
make
its
application
universal
the
quality
of
this
drama
furthermore
gives
it
a
force
and
cohesiveness
unattainable
by
either
epic
or
lyric
true
the
lucifer
as
a
drama
does
not
deal
with
men
however
this
is
a
distinction
without
a
difference
for
the
characters
while
they
command
our
awe
as
divinities
not
subject
to
the
limitations
of
this
carnal
shroud
the
body
are
yet
sufficiently
human
to
elicit
our
warmest
sympathy
it
is
moreover
a
play
full
of
passion
and
it
is
addressed
in
a
most
extraordinary
degree
to
the
moral
nature
the
chief
function
of
all
tragedy
here
too
as
in
the
great
drama
of
the
universe
the
divine
law
is
the
first
propelling
cause
of
the
action
the
clash
of
interests
and
the
logical
destiny
of
cause
and
effect
carry
the
tragic
subject
without
apparent
effort
to
its
denouement
the
causes
are
everywhere
adequate
to
produce
the
effects
and
no
trivial
effects
are
the
result
of
the
huge
action
no
mountain
is
set
in
travail
to
bring
forth
a
mouse
the
disposition
of
the
characters
also
conforms
to
our
sense
of
justice
and
their
development
is
everywhere
within
the
range
of
probability
besides
the
main
theme
ambition
and
the
chief
object
are
various
incidental
themes
and
objects
which
naturally
arise
out
of
the
circumstances
and
conditions
of
the
play
this
is
however
but
natural
and
only
renders
the
drama
more
varied
and
interesting
these
little
streams
of
interest
being
but
tributaries
to
the
main
stream
of
the
action
contributing
to
rather
than
retarding
its
majestic
sweep
to
the
niagara
of
its
catastrophe
the
drama
though
concerning
the
divine
beings
of
another
sphere
conforms
except
where
tradition
or
religion
has
invested
these
with
extraordinary
qualities
and
powers
to
the
physical
requirements
of
this
thus
making
it
more
probable
and
the
action
more
dramatic
the
dramatist
is
a
veritable
magician
leading
the
spectator
through
tortuous
mazes
of
expectation
into
a
labyrinth
of
suspense
the
end
is
reached
and
lo
the
path
which
appeared
so
bewilderingly
crooked
is
straight
and
direct
without
a
turn
to
its
starting
point
everywhere
too
the
mind
of
the
reader
coöperates
with
the
mind
of
the
poet
in
his
logical
appeals
to
the
heart
the
action
moreover
has
its
mainspring
in
error
and
ends
in
showing
the
natural
consequences
of
crime
with
a
picture
of
the
sin
atoned
though
not
unpunished
nowhere
is
the
human
interest
of
this
drama
lessened
by
grand
scenic
displays
these
are
truly
splendid
but
even
such
sublime
properties
as
the
universe
affords
only
heighten
the
interest
by
showing
that
after
all
the
thinking
will
we
call
the
soul
is
the
noblest
work
of
god
as
played
on
the
stage
the
drama
must
have
had
exceedingly
simple
though
perhaps
somewhat
costly
accessories
nothing
in
the
play
is
more
admirable
than
the
uninterrupted
contrast
of
thought
and
the
constant
antithesis
of
character
nothing
furthermore
can
surpass
the
inimitable
art
with
which
the
monologue
is
handled
at
the
critical
moments
that
determine
a
character
as
in
soliloquy
in
the
fourth
act
here
the
action
though
still
sweeping
irresistibly
on
seems
to
be
in
perfect
poise
while
the
inmost
secrets
of
the
heart
are
laid
bare
in
his
dialogue
also
vondel
is
simple
and
direct
the
conversation
is
always
used
to
recall
to
suggest
or
to
display
some
motive
that
binds
while
at
the
same
time
it
urges
the
action
in
such
scenes
of
course
talk
is
action
if
art
is
as
some
assert
a
thing
of
proportions
then
surely
this
drama
is
entitled
to
the
highest
praise
for
its
proportions
are
irreprehensible
if
too
as
ruskin
says
poetry
is
the
suggestion
by
the
imagination
of
noble
grounds
for
the
noble
emotions
as
a
poem
also
it
is
unsurpassed
there
are
indeed
as
many
definitions
of
poetry
as
there
are
poets
the
lucifer
is
vondel
definition
it
is
conception
that
suggests
the
correlated
thought
it
is
construction
that
shapes
it
to
the
stature
of
a
grand
design
and
construction
is
the
highest
form
of
the
creative
intellect
for
was
it
not
this
same
power
that
framed
the
templed
universe
out
of
the
scattered
fragments
of
countless
millions
of
stars
it
is
in
construction
the
highest
requisite
of
the
dramatist
wherein
the
lucifer
is
most
grand
the
architecture
of
the
play
is
as
symmetrical
as
a
beautiful
greek
temple
there
is
no
obscurity
in
this
classic
drama
into
which
moreover
the
poet
has
introduced
enough
of
the
modern
romantic
to
lend
it
vivacity
and
interest
such
a
subject
could
not
have
been
cast
save
in
a
classic
mould
the
romantic
drama
would
not
have
been
equal
to
the
majestic
dignity
and
the
stately
style
demanded
by
this
sublime
theme
each
act
with
its
own
subordinate
conclusion
is
followed
by
a
chorus
which
not
only
fills
the
pause
but
also
intensifies
while
at
the
same
time
it
relieves
the
suspense
these
choruses
noble
melodies
of
retrospect
are
yet
charged
with
the
rumbling
thunder
of
the
coming
catastrophe
each
is
as
it
were
an
incarnate
conscience
the
concentrated
echo
of
the
preceding
act
gathering
around
it
the
action
and
blending
harmoniously
with
it
vondel
is
one
of
the
few
moderns
who
grasped
the
fact
that
the
hellenic
drama
originated
in
rhythmic
song
and
that
around
the
choral
ode
should
gather
the
action
and
the
interest
of
the
play
his
chorus
therefore
act
both
as
singers
and
as
interpreters
of
the
action
relieving
the
measured
tread
of
stately
tragedy
with
pauses
of
musical
suspense
often
also
they
break
into
the
dialogue
and
act
as
mediators
and
as
moralists
the
chorus
represent
the
populi
of
heaven
and
voice
the
sentiments
of
the
many
the
interchange
of
thoughts
between
chorus
and
chorus
and
the
chorus
and
the
persons
produces
variety
to
this
the
swift
changes
of
thought
and
emotion
also
contribute
here
also
as
in
the
greek
dramas
we
observe
the
proper
subordination
of
the
chorus
to
the
protagonist
and
the
chief
characters
and
of
the
lyric
to
the
dramatic
elements
while
through
the
whole
play
the
length
of
the
speeches
is
artfully
suited
to
the
character
and
the
situation
much
too
might
be
said
about
vondel
felicities
of
rime
his
sweet
feminine
rimes
his
stately
sonorous
hexameters
his
trimeters
and
tetrameters
his
frequent
use
of
the
various
classic
metres
and
his
admirable
shifting
of
the
cæsura
to
suit
the
feeling
of
the
speaker
the
three
unities
are
here
also
carefully
preserved
which
perhaps
was
the
more
easily
done
on
account
of
the
divinity
of
the
characters
to
which
a
celerity
of
movement
was
natural
not
possible
to
mortals
hence
the
time
of
the
whole
drama
from
the
inception
of
the
revolt
until
the
final
catastrophe
could
very
probably
be
included
in
hours
the
unity
of
action
we
have
already
spoken
of
the
unity
of
place
is
equally
well
kept
the
lucifer
hardly
two
thousand
seven
hundred
lines
including
the
choruses
conforms
also
in
respect
to
length
to
the
classic
standard
the
growth
of
the
play
is
no
less
wonderful
than
the
characterization
many
preparations
and
conspiracies
developing
at
last
into
a
battle
many
scenes
into
a
definite
situation
the
numberless
changes
of
cause
and
effect
at
length
resulting
in
a
plot
full
of
the
force
of
an
motive
thus
from
the
varied
complexities
of
circumstance
and
situation
is
at
last
evolved
the
one
controlling
purpose
a
fine
antithesis
to
the
turbulent
catastrophe
is
the
quiet
climax
lucifer
soliloquy
in
act
iv
where
however
all
that
precedes
is
resolved
into
one
intense
situation
the
advent
of
rafael
here
furthermore
is
an
unforeseen
complication
to
heighten
the
interest
the
end
by
suggestive
reminiscence
of
the
fading
perspective
of
the
beginning
unites
the
commencement
with
the
close
making
the
drama
an
organic
whole
whose
soul
is
purpose
and
whose
heart
is
truth
the
exquisite
blending
of
the
action
with
the
characters
each
shaping
the
other
has
rarely
been
equalled
it
is
the
characters
after
all
that
are
the
chief
interest
and
that
control
the
action
we
see
here
the
strange
anomaly
of
a
classic
play
where
the
individual
shapes
the
action
and
is
yet
conquered
by
law
here
where
the
will
of
a
god
clashes
with
the
supreme
will
of
the
supreme
god
great
art
is
necessary
to
sustain
human
interest
to
delay
the
interposition
of
the
superior
deity
until
the
very
close
the
primary
motive
fails
grandly
yet
in
its
failure
it
brings
into
partial
fulfilment
the
secondary
motive
the
fall
of
man
true
the
logical
catastrophe
does
not
occasion
surprise
it
has
all
along
as
in
every
tragedy
been
foreshadowed
by
circumstances
big
with
fate
yet
vondel
has
added
the
element
of
surprise
and
to
a
remarkable
degree
by
the
introduction
of
a
second
catastrophe
the
expulsion
of
adam
from
paradise
the
natural
result
of
the
first
thus
curiosity
and
reason
only
end
with
the
play
itself
one
by
one
too
the
various
episodes
are
seen
to
spring
from
the
action
which
moreover
requires
no
introduction
of
antecedent
circumstance
to
set
it
in
motion
the
scenes
or
groups
a
sure
test
of
the
great
dramatist
are
handled
in
a
masterly
manner
there
is
also
a
delightful
retardation
which
heightens
the
suspense
and
delays
the
catastrophe
until
like
an
electric
cloud
it
bursts
into
the
thunder
of
its
own
generating
each
messenger
in
the
play
brings
vividly
before
the
eye
of
the
spectator
the
consequential
scene
which
he
himself
has
just
witnessed
of
which
perhaps
he
has
been
a
part
thus
by
the
artful
use
of
complications
the
action
once
projected
moves
on
to
its
end
where
the
totality
of
figures
thoughts
and
emotions
are
drawn
into
one
maelstrom
of
ruin
there
is
no
distraction
there
is
no
swerving
from
the
opening
to
the
catastrophe
from
the
catastrophe
to
the
conclusion
the
awful
retribution
as
in
the
tragedy
of
life
so
too
in
this
drama
the
innocent
suffer
through
the
punishment
that
overtakes
the
guilty
witness
the
sorrow
of
rafael
and
the
good
angels
at
the
fall
of
their
fellows
the
sin
of
adam
and
eve
and
the
doom
pronounced
upon
their
innocent
descendants
the
truth
of
vondel
poetic
conception
is
seen
in
the
fact
that
its
essential
elements
are
coeval
with
man
and
coeternal
with
the
universe
as
in
sophocles
we
hardly
know
which
most
to
admire
the
balanced
proportions
of
the
play
or
its
general
conception
here
also
we
often
in
a
single
sentence
find
a
synthesis
of
a
situation
or
a
character
vondel
moreover
most
impressively
introduces
into
the
ancient
greek
form
with
its
suggestion
of
an
destiny
the
modern
idea
of
free
will
and
he
does
it
so
admirably
that
there
is
no
confusion
simple
in
its
complexity
splendid
in
its
largeness
of
design
grand
in
its
harmony
magnificent
in
its
whole
conception
the
drama
sweeps
irresistibly
through
the
whole
gamut
of
human
emotion
such
epic
breadth
and
intense
lyric
concentration
have
rarely
been
combined
in
one
poem
such
a
drama
is
indeed
the
sum
of
all
the
arts
the
characterization
vondel
devils
are
no
devils
until
the
last
act
when
they
act
no
more
but
are
described
then
truly
they
are
the
incarnations
of
deepest
deviltries
and
are
as
splendid
in
their
malignity
as
they
were
formerly
superb
in
their
wickedness
the
sophistries
of
these
evil
spirits
are
scarcely
inferior
to
those
in
faust
they
are
the
meshes
of
a
gigantic
delusion
woven
by
the
leaders
of
the
conspiracy
around
the
rank
and
file
of
the
angels
seducing
them
from
bliss
to
doom
belzebub
is
the
cynic
of
the
play
a
compound
of
iago
and
mephistopheles
this
dark
contriver
of
hellish
plots
is
colossal
in
his
malignity
he
is
the
first
in
heaven
to
make
a
prurient
suggestion
he
is
more
fiend
than
his
noble
superior
sleepless
unrelenting
resourceful
alert
he
conjures
motives
of
evil
even
from
the
tender
beauty
of
the
primal
innocence
he
finds
the
gall
of
hate
even
in
the
sweet
flower
of
eden
sinless
love
his
is
the
deliberating
intellect
necessary
for
the
stadtholder
counsellor
and
though
slowly
unfolding
the
many
sides
of
his
malign
nature
he
is
we
feel
evil
from
the
beginning
grandly
diabolical
belial
conscienceless
and
without
remorse
is
utterly
depraved
a
vile
seducer
the
genius
of
deceit
who
does
evil
for
its
own
sake
a
useful
tool
to
serve
the
baser
purposes
of
the
chief
devil
apollion
has
some
gleams
of
goodness
in
his
nature
but
is
weak
lustful
and
easily
influenced
by
the
hope
of
gain
a
type
of
the
traitor
all
of
the
devils
and
they
are
the
chief
characters
of
the
play
may
be
supposed
to
represent
the
different
phases
of
evil
while
the
good
angels
whose
characteristics
have
been
but
briefly
indicated
show
the
different
attributes
of
the
deity
as
in
the
œdipus
tyrannus
the
country
must
be
purged
so
here
too
the
heavens
must
be
cleansed
of
this
perjured
scum
the
rebellious
angels
we
must
now
proceed
to
speak
of
lucifer
his
wrath
his
ambition
his
pride
and
infernal
energy
these
traits
are
exhibited
in
gigantic
outlines
even
before
his
fall
after
his
defeat
what
can
be
more
impressive
than
his
archangelic
passion
glorious
in
its
mood
not
his
the
wild
outbursts
nor
the
mad
ravings
of
lear
every
ebullition
of
his
anger
is
fraught
with
purpose
and
is
transmuted
into
revengeful
action
mind
and
spirit
are
after
all
the
conquering
forces
of
the
universe
material
circumstance
and
physical
environment
can
not
thwart
their
design
it
is
this
ennobling
consciousness
of
intellectual
power
supplemented
by
unconquerable
and
irresistible
will
that
makes
the
magnificence
of
the
personality
of
lucifer
like
milton
satan
he
is
we
feel
most
near
a
god
when
he
is
most
a
devil
lucifer
like
macbeth
is
not
influenced
all
at
once
with
a
circumspection
he
first
weighs
every
atom
of
probability
however
when
the
die
is
cast
and
the
line
of
rebellion
has
once
been
crossed
he
fights
to
the
last
ditch
lucifer
is
a
sublime
egoist
the
spirit
of
negation
placed
against
the
limitations
of
the
positive
he
is
overpowering
no
one
even
for
an
instant
dares
to
dispute
his
power
not
even
the
grand
michael
his
is
the
unconquerable
batavian
heart
he
dominates
the
entire
action
and
like
a
magnet
draws
all
the
other
characters
around
him
though
jealousy
of
man
is
the
animating
passion
of
the
lower
devils
and
the
excuse
of
the
protagonist
himself
yet
we
feel
that
he
uses
this
merely
as
a
stalking
horse
for
his
overweening
ambition
lucifer
would
become
god
himself
it
is
an
unwritten
law
of
great
tragedy
that
the
villain
though
a
villain
must
be
admirable
lucifer
that
he
is
is
superb
in
his
constructive
villany
a
very
god
of
evil
with
resources
at
his
command
formidable
enough
to
make
or
to
mar
a
world
and
yet
resulting
only
in
his
own
undoing
proud
in
the
consciousness
of
godlike
powers
he
thinks
i
have
a
bit
of
fiat
in
my
soul
and
can
myself
create
a
little
world
his
confidence
however
proves
to
be
but
the
fiat
of
his
damnation
there
is
no
fiercer
hell
than
the
failure
in
a
great
undertaking
into
this
hell
lucifer
was
forever
thrust
yet
he
is
allowed
one
brief
moment
of
happiness
it
is
where
he
proclaims
himself
a
god
and
is
worshipped
by
his
followers
lucifer
is
the
prince
of
thinkers
and
a
monarch
among
actors
his
is
the
intellect
to
plan
and
to
conceive
and
the
will
to
execute
and
will
is
above
all
the
one
quality
emphasized
as
much
as
he
is
in
this
respect
supereminent
so
much
greater
the
degree
of
his
guilt
could
the
force
of
this
faculty
have
been
better
shown
than
in
the
picture
of
the
fallen
archangel
where
in
the
agonies
of
torture
and
the
throes
of
expiation
he
not
only
deliberates
resolves
and
executes
but
even
exults
as
culling
the
bitter
sweetness
of
a
hopeless
hope
from
the
of
despair
he
rejoices
in
the
fiendish
triumph
that
he
knows
is
but
the
prelude
to
everlasting
doom
unlike
the
unconquerable
and
prometheus
he
allows
not
one
sigh
to
escape
from
the
depths
of
his
anguish
not
one
moan
rises
from
his
abysmal
despair
malediction
alone
can
unlock
his
implacable
lips
from
even
the
caverns
of
hell
he
projects
his
evil
genius
back
into
space
to
accomplish
a
predetermined
revenge
lucifer
reasons
with
rafael
and
with
gabriel
but
with
michael
only
war
is
possible
the
two
chiefs
are
too
equal
in
power
too
proud
and
too
warlike
to
waste
time
in
words
each
accustomed
to
command
will
brook
no
authority
in
the
other
the
pathos
and
the
tenderness
of
rafael
on
the
other
hand
present
a
strong
relief
to
the
sombre
passions
of
lucifer
it
is
the
ethical
portraiture
of
this
drama
that
is
its
most
powerful
feature
lucifer
also
in
a
certain
sense
represents
the
ideal
dutchman
combining
in
a
losing
struggle
the
daring
of
civilis
and
the
intellect
of
erasmus
with
the
astuteness
and
magnanimity
of
william
the
silent
a
grand
hero
in
a
bad
cause
lucifer
has
indeed
set
the
time
out
of
joint
for
adam
seed
yet
the
play
also
gives
promise
of
the
christ
who
will
again
make
all
things
right
there
is
here
also
a
suggestion
of
the
paradise
regained
the
drama
is
ended
the
thunders
have
ceased
to
roll
and
are
again
chained
to
the
chariot
of
the
deity
the
lightnings
once
more
slumber
in
the
bosom
of
the
night
the
battle
is
over
the
air
is
again
pure
and
clear
the
good
has
been
exalted
the
bad
has
been
debased
the
heart
of
the
spectator
too
has
been
the
scene
of
the
battle
of
the
passions
terror
pity
hope
despair
love
joy
peace
have
each
alternated
in
brief
possession
the
of
the
soul
is
accomplished
it
has
been
purified
of
all
that
is
gross
and
earthly
it
has
become
spiritualized
it
has
become
conscious
of
its
wings
thrilled
with
aspiration
for
the
ethereal
and
for
the
stars
beyond
is
the
lucifer
a
political
allegory
it
is
maintained
by
several
eminent
dutch
critics
that
the
lucifer
is
a
political
allegory
like
the
palamedes
and
several
other
tragedies
of
vondel
some
of
these
literati
have
displayed
considerable
ingenuity
in
their
attempt
to
prove
that
it
typifies
the
struggle
of
the
netherlands
against
spain
orange
corresponding
to
lucifer
philip
ii
to
god
alva
to
michael
the
cardinal
granvelle
to
adam
many
of
the
situations
of
the
play
bear
out
this
analogy
lucifer
like
orange
was
the
idol
of
his
followers
both
desire
to
change
a
hated
tyranny
to
a
state
of
freedom
both
speak
grandiloquently
of
a
charter
disannulled
and
of
ancient
privileges
violated
the
simile
of
the
sea
dashing
in
vain
against
the
rock
in
the
of
the
lucifer
may
be
supposed
to
illustrate
the
device
of
orange
tranquillus
in
the
crescent
array
of
the
rebels
may
refer
to
the
shibboleth
of
the
rather
turk
than
papist
the
lion
and
the
dragon
that
draw
the
chariot
of
the
archfiend
are
also
blazoned
upon
the
crest
of
the
two
provinces
holland
and
zealand
which
were
the
chief
supporters
of
orange
the
medley
of
seven
beasts
into
which
lucifer
in
falling
was
changed
may
be
taken
to
represent
the
seven
northern
provinces
that
became
the
dutch
republic
while
the
southern
provinces
which
remained
loyal
to
spain
nearly
of
the
whole
number
may
be
typified
by
the
faithful
angels
lucifer
renewed
the
fight
three
times
so
did
orange
both
pretended
to
fight
lege
rege
et
in
that
age
before
successful
revolutions
had
established
a
precedent
no
revolt
could
hope
for
success
unless
by
conforming
to
the
maxim
the
king
can
do
no
wrong
a
cardinal
principle
in
every
religion
of
that
day
by
this
political
fiction
rebels
professed
to
fight
for
the
king
though
really
fighting
against
him
vondel
pictured
his
revolt
after
these
examples
the
most
prominent
of
which
was
the
revolt
of
his
own
country
against
philip
ii
lucifer
however
fell
and
orange
triumphed
though
the
assassination
of
the
latter
might
be
taken
as
equivalent
to
a
fall
lucifer
accomplished
the
fall
of
adam
even
as
orange
brought
about
the
expulsion
of
granvelle
alva
like
michael
furthermore
received
the
charge
to
burn
out
with
a
glow
of
fire
and
zeal
the
polluting
stains
of
heresy
egmont
and
montigny
like
gabriel
and
rafael
acted
as
ambassadors
the
cause
of
the
jealousy
of
the
netherlander
as
in
the
lucifer
was
the
fact
that
greater
privileges
were
accorded
to
foreigners
the
spaniards
than
to
the
hereditary
princes
of
the
land
as
in
the
drama
gabriel
proclamation
is
followed
by
protest
and
rebellion
so
in
the
netherlands
the
unjust
edicts
of
philip
were
the
primary
cause
of
revolt
it
was
the
sworn
duty
of
the
stadtholder
william
of
orange
even
as
of
the
stadtholder
lucifer
to
maintain
the
laws
of
his
superior
orange
also
held
a
position
similar
to
that
of
lucifer
he
was
the
favorite
of
charles
stadtholder
of
holland
and
knight
of
the
golden
fleece
each
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
the
disaffected
at
their
earnest
importunity
each
was
accused
of
ambition
each
accomplished
his
designs
by
machiavelian
methods
and
attained
a
brief
exaltation
cardinal
granvelle
who
held
a
position
similar
to
adam
in
the
drama
was
like
him
of
low
descent
and
was
honored
with
greater
privileges
than
even
the
nobles
themselves
who
hated
him
intensely
the
opponents
of
the
cardinal
changed
the
liveries
of
their
servants
into
motley
to
mock
him
so
also
we
hear
lucifer
say
to
his
minions
lay
off
your
morning
rays
and
wreaths
of
light
the
nobles
complained
of
the
presence
of
spanish
troops
in
the
land
so
the
luciferians
speak
of
adam
many
thousand
strong
the
arguments
of
the
drama
were
also
the
arguments
advanced
by
the
several
parties
in
the
dutch
revolt
the
three
hierarchies
of
heaven
in
the
lucifer
correspond
to
margaret
three
councils
of
state
lucifer
though
described
as
nighest
to
god
belonged
only
to
the
third
rank
of
the
hierarchies
just
as
orange
though
first
among
the
dutch
noblemen
and
next
to
philip
was
yet
subject
to
the
state
as
stadtholder
brederode
as
the
head
of
the
aristocrats
who
went
with
supplications
to
margaret
of
parma
bears
a
close
analogy
to
belzebub
where
the
latter
says
to
the
luciferians
with
prayers
ye
first
and
best
might
gain
your
end
and
where
too
he
expresses
his
willingness
to
act
as
mediator
in
this
scheme
furthermore
apollion
would
represent
louis
of
nassau
and
belial
marnix
aldegonde
others
see
in
the
drama
the
career
of
the
great
wallenstein
the
ambitious
generalissimo
of
the
thirty
years
war
in
his
envy
of
the
son
of
his
emperor
and
in
his
desire
to
place
the
crown
of
hungary
on
his
own
head
an
analogy
is
suggested
to
lucifer
attitude
to
adam
even
as
the
celestial
rebels
swore
their
chief
allegiance
so
too
his
generals
after
the
reverse
of
pilsen
when
his
enemies
wished
to
deprive
him
of
his
command
swore
him
faith
and
fealty
vondel
it
is
asserted
was
conscious
of
this
when
he
dedicated
this
drama
to
ferdinand
the
third
emperor
of
austria
who
was
no
other
than
the
intended
king
of
hungary
who
had
aroused
the
envy
of
wallenstein
and
whose
succession
to
the
crown
had
been
so
much
endangered
by
the
latter
treachery
but
there
is
yet
another
view
of
the
subject
which
has
even
more
show
of
probability
than
either
of
the
others
it
is
supposed
by
many
that
the
lucifer
was
intended
to
represent
the
english
rebellion
of
lucifer
in
this
analogy
is
supposed
to
represent
cromwell
whom
vondel
hated
so
bitterly
and
against
whom
he
thundered
such
tremendous
invective
indeed
there
are
some
external
circumstances
in
support
of
this
theory
speaking
of
his
lampoons
on
the
great
english
rebel
the
poet
says
that
they
were
written
the
same
year
that
he
taught
lucifer
his
rôle
to
play
he
also
says
elsewhere
that
the
lucifer
was
presented
forsooth
as
edifying
lore
wherein
proud
england
hath
much
store
if
the
last
supposition
be
true
the
drama
is
remarkable
as
prophesying
the
fall
of
the
commonwealth
and
the
restoration
it
would
then
moreover
not
be
uninteresting
to
compare
it
with
dryden
absalom
and
achitophel
in
which
oliver
cromwell
is
also
one
of
the
chief
characters
the
interpretation
yet
we
can
not
believe
that
the
lucifer
is
a
political
allegory
vondel
was
no
more
the
poet
of
the
palamedes
those
thirty
years
had
wonderfully
developed
his
art
nor
is
it
an
idyllic
allegory
like
the
comus
but
like
the
divina
commedia
an
allegory
of
the
world
yet
behind
the
characters
of
the
sacred
legend
we
may
also
see
the
national
heroes
siegfried
beowulf
civilis
orange
the
lucifer
represents
the
gigantic
and
eternal
battle
of
evil
with
good
with
the
universe
as
the
a
type
of
the
unending
conflict
in
which
the
good
finally
conquers
we
see
here
the
oriental
imagination
curbed
by
the
reason
of
the
occident
the
cold
statuesque
greek
form
aglow
with
the
blazing
hebrew
soul
the
flaming
seraph
of
christianity
winged
with
truth
and
armed
with
the
lightning
sword
of
jehovah
and
the
blasting
thunderbolts
of
jupiter
sweeps
triumphant
through
the
whole
drama
right
prevails
wrong
is
overthrown
the
lucifer
is
a
theory
of
existence
a
scheme
of
the
universe
it
is
the
revolt
of
the
aspiring
ideal
against
the
invincible
actual
it
is
the
material
against
the
spiritual
the
unknown
rendered
comprehensible
by
the
symbolism
of
the
known
from
shadowy
types
to
truth
from
flesh
to
spirit
this
is
the
order
of
its
progression
it
is
the
revolution
of
the
speculative
against
the
rule
of
dogma
an
impassioned
contemplation
of
life
in
which
the
whole
gamut
of
human
feelings
is
harmoniously
sounded
in
which
every
link
in
the
chain
of
causation
is
struck
into
the
music
of
its
meaning
in
which
the
past
and
the
future
are
mirrored
in
the
present
it
is
the
struggle
of
a
soul
against
the
unchangeable
environment
of
fate
the
drama
of
the
collective
human
soul
aspiring
from
a
chaos
of
unrest
to
the
unattainable
peace
of
absolute
truth
furthermore
the
tragedy
typifies
the
character
of
the
hollanders
themselves
a
people
who
as
charles
once
remarked
made
the
best
of
subjects
but
the
worst
of
slaves
a
nation
that
has
ever
been
in
revolt
not
only
against
man
but
even
against
the
sublime
forces
of
nature
a
race
that
has
never
known
defeat
the
batavians
who
under
claudius
civilis
carried
on
a
successful
rebellion
against
the
eagles
of
rome
the
only
germans
who
never
bowed
beneath
the
latin
yoke
and
their
saxon
descendants
who
were
the
strongest
foes
of
the
territorial
aggressions
of
charlemagne
were
all
flamed
with
the
same
unconquerable
spirit
it
was
this
spirit
too
that
enabled
the
hollanders
of
the
seventeenth
century
after
more
than
eighty
years
of
terrible
conflict
to
free
themselves
alike
from
the
grinding
oppression
of
spain
and
the
still
more
oppressive
coils
of
religious
tyranny
the
dutch
struggle
itself
was
a
terrific
drama
of
which
william
the
silent
was
the
protagonist
and
liberty
the
one
controlling
purpose
that
animated
every
character
that
impelled
every
action
it
was
the
details
the
reasons
the
arguments
and
the
conditions
of
this
stupendous
struggle
that
were
before
the
poet
mind
when
he
wrote
this
tragedy
the
lucifer
though
a
symbolic
sketch
of
the
age
which
preceded
it
is
essentially
a
drama
embodying
the
spirit
of
the
time
in
which
it
was
created
it
is
a
reflex
of
the
life
of
that
epoch
the
embodiment
of
the
soul
consciousness
of
the
storm
and
stress
period
of
vondel
own
life
he
himself
was
in
perpetual
revolt
against
the
universal
practices
of
his
age
is
it
a
wonder
that
men
seeing
in
it
not
only
a
picture
of
themselves
but
also
of
their
time
were
at
once
attracted
by
its
significance
the
titanic
imagination
of
the
nibelungen
and
the
tremendous
imagery
of
beowulf
were
both
the
inevitable
expression
of
the
tumultuous
soul
of
the
teuton
conscious
of
a
great
destiny
this
was
in
the
dawn
of
the
nation
childhood
we
next
view
the
race
in
the
pride
of
its
glorious
youth
rousing
itself
after
the
sleep
of
centuries
to
gigantic
action
from
that
age
sprang
the
lucifer
we
then
see
it
in
the
maturity
of
noble
reflecting
manhood
whose
years
have
given
dignity
and
strength
faust
stands
before
us
as
its
full
expression
and
vondel
and
goethe
are
each
the
seeing
eye
that
pierced
the
hidden
mystery
of
his
time
each
in
his
own
way
solved
the
world
riddle
like
faust
the
lucifer
is
ever
more
a
striving
towards
the
highest
existence
true
the
striving
hero
has
here
been
hurled
to
the
depths
of
the
lowest
abyss
yet
is
not
his
motive
also
the
animating
spirit
of
the
race
ever
onward
and
upward
towards
the
unattainable
like
the
defeated
lucifer
in
hell
the
teuton
is
ever
evolving
courage
for
a
new
attempt
fired
with
the
hope
that
never
despairs
siegfried
beowulf
and
lucifer
all
typify
the
spirit
of
revolt
that
love
of
freedom
and
that
strong
individualism
which
has
always
been
the
distinguishing
characteristic
of
the
low
germans
of
the
lucifer
therefore
it
may
truly
be
said
it
is
the
biography
of
a
national

the

emperor
of

perpetual
increaser
of

as
the
divine
majesty
is
throned

which
owe
their
lustre
to
god
and
are

in

image
of

are
seated
on

as
the
godhead
or
rather
the
supreme
goodness
favors
the
least
and
most
humble
with

so
too
doth
the
temporal
power
deem
its
most
insignificant
subject
worthy
to
kneel
reverentially
at
its
feet
inspired
with
this
hope
my
muse
is
encouraged
from
afar
to
dedicate
to
your
imperial
majesty
this
tragedy
of
lucifer
whose
style
demands
a
most
liberal
degree
of
that
gravity
and
stateliness
of
which
the
poet
speaks
omne
genus
scripti
gravitate
tragoedia
vincit
sublime
in
style
and
deep
in
tone
the
tragic
art
doth
stand
alone
though
whatever
of
the
requisite
sublimity
may
be
wanting
in
the
style
will
be
compensated
by
the
subject
of
the
drama
and
the
title
name
and
eminence
of
the
personage
who
the
mirror
of
all
ungrateful
and
ambitious
ones
doth
here
invest
the
tragic
scene
the
heavens
from
which
he
who
once
presumed
to
sit
by
the
side
of
god
and
thought
to
become
his
equal
was
cast
and
justly
condemned
to
eternal
darkness
this
unhappy
example
of
lucifer
the
archangel
and
at
one
time
the
most
glorious
of
all
the
angels
has
since
been
followed
through
nearly
all
the
centuries
by
various
rebellious
usurpers
of
which
both
ancient
and
modern
histories
bear
witness
showing
how
violence
cunning
and
the
wily
plots
of
the
wicked
disguised
beneath
a
show
and
pretext
of
lawfulness
are
idle
and
powerless
so
long
as
god
providence
protects
the
anointed
powers
and
dynasties
to
the
peace
and
safety
of
divers
states
which
without
a
lawful
supreme
head
could
not
exist
in
civil
intercourse
therefore
god
oracle
himself
for
the
good
of
mankind
by
one
word
identified
the
sovran
power
as
his
own
when
he
commanded
that
to
god
and
to
caesar
should
be
rendered
the
things
that
to
each
were
due
christendom
so
often
attacked
on
every
side
and
at
present
beset
by
turk
and
tartar
like
unto
a
ship
on
a
stormy
sea
in
danger
of
demands
to
the
highest
degree
this
universal
reverence
for
the
empire
that
thereby
the
hereditary
foe
of
christ
name
may
be
repulsed
and
that
the
realm
and
its
frontiers
may
be
strengthened
and
rendered
safe
against
the
incursions
of
his
savage
hordes
wherefore
it
behooves
us
to
praise
god
that
it
pleased
him
to
continue
the
authority
and
the
crown
of
the
holy
roman
empire
at
the
last
imperial
diet
before
his
father
death
in
the
son
ferdinand
the
fourth
a
blessing
which
has
filled
so
many
nations
with
courage
and
which
causes
the
tragic
trumpet
of
our
netherland
muse
to
sound
more
boldly
before
the
throne

the
high

represents

here
presented
to
your
view
the
great
archangels
lucifer
and
michael
each
strengthened
by
his
followers
come
on
the
stage
and
play
their
parts
the
stage
and
the
actors
are
in
sooth
of
such
nature
and
so
glorious
that
they
demand
a
grander
style
and
higher
buskins
than
i
know
how
to
put
on
no
one
who
understands
the
speech
of
the
infallible
oracles
of
the
holy
spirit
will
judge
that
we
present
here
the
story
of
salmoneus
who
in
elis
mounted
upon
his
chariot
while
defying
jupiter
and
imitating
his
thunder
and
lightning
by
riding
over
a
brazen
bridge
holding
a
burning
torch
was
slain
by
a
thunderbolt
nor
do
we
renew
here
the
grey
fable
of
the
war
of
the
titans
in
which
disguise
poesy
sought
to
make
its
auditors
forget
their
reckless
presumption
and
godless
sacrilege
and
to
acquire
a
knowledge
of
nature
instead
namely
that
the
air
and
the
winds
locked
within
the
hollow
belly
and
the
sulphurous
bowels
of
the
earth
seeking
at
times
an
outlet
accompanied
by
the
violence
of
bursting
rocks
and
by
smoke
and
steam
and
flames
and
earthquakes
and
dreadful
mutterings
are
vomited
and
rising
heavenwards
again
descend
strewing
and
heaping
the
surface
of
land
and
sea
with
stones
and
ashes
among
the
prophets
isaiah
and
ezekiel
assure
us
of
the
fall
of
the
archangel
and
his
faction
in
the
evangelist
christ
truest
of
all
oracles
with
his
voice
out
of
the
heavens
enjoins
us
to
hear
and
finally
judas
thaddeus
his
faithful
apostle
which
parables
are
worthy
to
be
engraved
in
eternal
diamond
and
more
worthy
still
upon
our
hearts
isaiah
cries
how
art
thou
fallen
from
heaven
o
lucifer
who
didst
rise
in
the
morning
how
art
thou
fallen
to
the
earth
that
didst
wound
the
nations
and
thou
saidst
in
thy
heart
i
will
ascend
to
heaven
i
will
exalt
my
throne
above
the
stars
of
god
i
will
sit
in

mountain
of

in
the
sides
of
the
north
i
will
ascend
above
the
height
of
the
clouds
i
will
be
like
the
most
high
but
yet
thou
shalt
be
brought
down
to
hell
into
the
depth
of
the
pit
god
speaks
through
ezekiel
thus
thou
wast
the
seal
of
resemblance
full
of
wisdom
perfect
in
beauty
thou
wast
in
the
pleasures
of
the
paradise
of
god
every
precious
stone
was
thy
covering
the
sardius
the
topaz
and
the
jasper
the
chrysolite
and
the
onyx
and
the
beryl
the
sapphire
and
the
carbuncle
and
the
emerald
gold
was
thy
adornment
thy
pipes
were
prepared
in
the
day
thou
wast
created
thou
didst
spread
thyself
like
an
overshadowing
cherub
and
i
set
thee
on
the

both

of

like
unto

in

and

were

and

jesus
christ
refers
to
the
fall
of
the
rebellious
lucifer
where
he
says
i
saw
satan
like
lightning
falling
from

and
thaddeus
reveals
the
fall
of
the
angels
and
their
crime
and
the
punishments
which
followed
thereon
without
any
palliation
briefly
in
this
manner
and
the
angels
who
kept
not
their
principality
but
forsook
their
own
habitation
he
hath
reserved
with
everlasting
chains
of
darkness
unto
the
judgment
of
the
great
god
stayed
by
these
golden
sayings
and
in
particular
by
that
of
judas
thaddeus
disciple
of
the
heavenly
teacher
and
ambassador
from
the
king
of
kings
we
receive
as
upon
a
shield
of
adamant
the
darts
of
the
unbelieving
who
would
dare
to
cast
a
doubt
upon
the
fall
of
the
angels
besides
this
we
are
strongly
supported
throughout
the
whole
period
of
antiquity
by
the
most
illustrious
of
the
devout
church
fathers
who
in
respect
to
the
plot
of
this
history
are
unanimously
agreed
though
lest
we
detain
our
academic
friends
we
shall
be
content
to
cite
only
three
places
the
first
taken
out
of
the
holy
cyprian
bishop
and
martyr
at
carthage
where
he
writes
when
he
who
was
formerly
throned
in
angelic
majesty
and
accounted
worthy
by
god
and
pleasing
in
his
sight
saw
man
made
in
god
own
image
he
burst
into
malicious
hate
not
however
causing
him
to
fall
by
poisoning
him
with
this
hatred
ere
he
himself
was
thereby
also
undone
himself
made
captive
ere
he
captured
and
ruined
ere
he
brought
him
to
ruin
while
he
spurred
on
by
envy
robbed
man
of
the
grace
of
immortality
once
given
him
he
himself
also
lost
all
that
he
had
before
possessed
the
great
gregory
furnishes
us
the
second
quotation
the
rebellious
angel
created
to
shine
preëminent
among
hosts
of
angels
is
through
his
pride
brought
to
such
a
fall
that
he
now
remains
subject
to
the
dominion
of
the
loyal
angels
the
third
and
last
evidence
we
cull
from
the
sermons
of
the
mellifluous
bernard
shun
pride
i
pray
you
shun
it
the
source
of
all
transgression
is
pride
which
hath
overcast
lucifer
himself
shining
most
splendidly
amongst
the
stars
with
eternal
darkness
not
only
an
angel
but
the
chief
among
angels
it
hath
changed
into
a
devil
pride
and
envy
the
two
causes
or
inciters
of
this
horrible
conflagration
of
discord
and
battle
are
represented
by
us
as
a
team
of
starred
animals
the
lion
and
the
dragon
which
harnessed
to
carry
him
against
god
and
michael
seeing
that
these
animals
are
types
of
these
two
deadly
sins
for
the
lion
king
of
beasts
encouraged
by
his
strength
in
his
vanity
thinks
no
one
above
him
and
envy
injures
the
envied
from
afar
even
as
the
dragon
wounds
his
enemy
a
long
way
off
by
shooting
poison
from
his
tongue
augustine
ascribing
these
two
deadly
sins
to
lucifer
pictures
the
nature
of
the
same
most
vividly
saying
that
pride
is
a
love
of
own
greatness
but
envy
is
a
hatred
of
another
happiness
the
outcome
of
which
seems
clear
enough
for
each
one
says
he
who
loves
his
own
greatness
envies
his
equals
inasmuch
as
they
stand
as
high
as
he
or
envies
his
inferiors
lest
they
become
his
equals
or
his
superiors
because
they
are
above
him
now
since
the
beasts
themselves
were
abused
and
possessed
by
the
damned
spirits
as
in
the
beginning
the
paradise
serpent
and
in
the
holy
age
the
herd
of
swine
that
with
a
loud
noise
was
precipitated
into
the
sea
and
since
also
the
constellations
are
pictured
on
the
heavens
in
the
forms
of
animals
as
hath
been
thought
even
by
the
prophets
as
the
pleiades
or
seven
stars
and
arcturus
orion
and
lucifer
so
may
it
please
you
to
overlook
the
elaborateness
and
the
didacticism
of
this
drama
if
the
unfortunate
spirits
upon
our
stage
by
means
of
the
same
help
and
defend
themselves
for
to
the
infernal
monsters
nothing
is
more
natural
than
cunning
traits
and
the
abuse
of
all
creatures
and
elements
to
the
prejudice
of
the
name
and
honor
of
the
most
high
so
far
as
he
shall
this
permit
john
in
his
revelation
typifies
the
heavenly
mysteries
and
the
war
in
heaven
by
the
dragon
whose
tail
drew
after
him
a
third
part
of
the
stars
supposed
by
the
theologians
to
refer
to
the
fallen
angels
wherefore
in
poetry
the
flowered
manner
of
expression
should
not
be
examined
too
narrowly
nor
regulated
by
the
subtlety
of
the
schools
we
should
also
make
distinction
between
the
two
kinds
of
characters
who
contend
on
this
stage
namely
the
bad
and
the
good
angels
each
kind
playing
its
own
rôle
even
as
cicero
and
our
inborn
sense
of
verisimilitude
teach
us
to
picture
each
character
according
to
his
rank
and
nature
at
the
same
time
we
by
no
means
deny
that
holy
subject
matter
restrains
and
binds
the
dramatist
more
closely
than
worldly
histories
or
pagan
fables
notwithstanding
that
ancient
and
famous
motto
of
the
poets
expressed
by
horatius
flaccus
in
his
art
of
poetry
in
these
lines
the
painter
and
the
bard
did
both
this
power
receive
to
aid
their
art
with
all
that
they
of
use
believe
though
here
it
is
especially
noteworthy
to
state
how
we
in
order
to
inflame
the
hate
of
the
proud
and
envious
spirits
the
more
strongly
did
cause
the
mystery
of
the
future
incarnation
of
the
word
to
be
partially
revealed
to
the
angels
by
the
archangel
gabriel
ambassador
from
god
and
herald
of
his
mysteries
herein
to
improve
the
matter
following
not
the
opinion
of
the
majority
of
the
theologians
but
only
of
a
few
because
this
furnished
our
tragic
picture
richer
material
and
more
lustre
however
neither
in
this
point
nor
in
other
circumstances
of
cause
time
place
and
manner
which
we
employed
to
render
this
tragedy
more
powerful
more
glorious
more
natural
and
more
instructive
has
it
been
our
purpose
to
obscure
the
orthodox
truth
or
to
establish
anything
after
our
own
finding
or
notion
paul
the
revealer
of
god
mysteries
to
the
hebrews
extols
most
enviably
even
to
the
prejudice
of
the
kingdom
of
the
lying
and
tempting
spirits
the
glory
might
and
godhead
of
the
incarnate
word
preëminent
among
all
angels
in
name
in
sonship
and
in
heirship
in
the
adoration
of
the
angels
in
his
unction
in
his
exaltation
at
god
right
hand
and
in
the
eternity
of
his
rulership
as
a
king
over
the
coming
world
as
the
cause
and
the
end
of
all
things
and
as
the
crowned
head
of
men
and
angels
while
the
angels
his
worshippers
god
messengers
as
ministering
spirits
are
sent
to
serve
man
the
heir
of
salvation
whose
nature
god
son
passing
the
angels
by
hath
taken
upon
himself
in
the
blood
of
abraham
by
occasion
of
this
justification
i
do
not
deem
it
unsuitable
here
in
passing
to
say
a
few
words
in
vindication
of
those
dramas
and
dramatists
that
employ
biblical
subjects
inasmuch
as
they
have
occasionally
come
into
reproach
since
forsooth
human
tastes
are
so
various
for
a
difference
in
temperament
causes
the
same
subject
to
be
agreeable
to
one
which
is
repulsive
to
another
all
honorable
arts
and
customs
have
their
supporters
and
opponents
also
their
proper
use
and
abuse
the
holy
writers
of
tragedy
have
among
the
ancient
hebrews
for
their
example
the
poet
ezekiel
who
has
left
us
in
greek
the
exodus
of
the
twelve
tribes
from
egypt
among
the
reverend
church
fathers
they
have
that
bright
star
out
of
the
east
gregory
of
nazianzus
who
in
greek
dramatic
verse
hath
pictured
the
crucified
saviour
himself
as
also
not
long
since
we
became
indebted
to
the
royal
ambassador
hugo
grotius
that
great
light
of
the
learning
and
piety
of
our
age
who
following
in
the
track
of
gregory
hath
given
us
the
crucified
one
in
latin
for
which
immortal
and
edifying
labor
we
owe
him
both
honor
and
thankfulness
among
the
english
protestants
the
learned
pen
of
richard
baker
hath
discoursed
very
freely
in
prose
concerning
lucifer
and
all
the
acts
of
the
rebellious
spirits
it
is
true
that
the
fathers
of
the
ancient
church
banished
the
christian
actors
from
the
community
of
the
church
and
that
from
that
time
forth
they
were
strongly
opposed
to
the
drama
but
let
us
take
into
consideration
the
time
and
the
fact
that
their
reasons
for
this
were
far
different
at
that
period
the
world
in
many
places
was
yet
deeply
sunken
in
heathenish
idolatry
the
foundations
of
christianity
were
not
yet
well
established
and
the
dramas
were
played
in
honor
of
cybele
a
great
goddess
and
mother
of
their
imagined
gods
and
were
esteemed
a
serviceable
expedient
with
which
to
avert
the
land
plagues
from
the
bodies
of
the
people
augustine
testifies
how
a
heathen
archpriest
a
minister
of
ritual
and
idol
service
on
account
of
a
deadly
pest
first
instituted
the
drama
at
rome
sanctioning
it
by
his
authority
scaliger
himself
acknowledges
that
it
was
established
for
the
health
of
the
people
by
order
of
the
sibyls
so
that
these
plays
became
a
truly
powerful
incentive
to
the
blind
idolatry
of
the
heathen
extolling
their
gods
a
cankering
abomination
whose
destruction
cost
the
first
heroes
of
the
cross
and
the
church
so
much
sweat
and
blood
but
being
now
long
extirpated
hath
left
in
europe
not
a
vestige
behind
that
the
holy
old
church
fathers
therefore
for
these
reasons
and
also
because
of
their
corrupting
the
public
morals
and
various
open
and
shameless
customs
as
the
employment
of
naked
boys
women
and
maidens
and
other
obscenities
should
rebuke
these
plays
was
needful
and
commendable
as
in
that
case
would
also
be
so
now
this
being
considered
let
us
not
hold
the
good
and
the
usefulness
of
edifying
and
entertaining
plays
too
lightly
holy
and
honorable
examples
serve
as
a
mirror
reflecting
for
our
edification
all
virtue
and
piety
and
teaching
us
at
the
same
time
to
shun
wickedness
and
its
consequent
misery
the
purpose
and
design
of
true
tragedy
is
through
terror
and
sympathy
to
stir
the
spectators
to
tenderness
through
the
drama
students
and
growing
youth
are
cultivated
in
the
languages
eloquence
wisdom
modesty
good
morals
and
manners
and
these
sink
into
their
tender
hearts
and
are
impressed
upon
their
senses
conducing
towards
habits
of
propriety
and
discretion
which
remain
with
them
and
to
which
they
adhere
even
until
old
age
yea
it
occurs
at
times
that
erratic
geniuses
not
to
be
bent
or
diverted
by
ordinary
methods
are
touched
by
this
subtle
art
and
by
an
exalted
dramatic
style
thus
influenced
beyond
their
own
suspicion
even
as
a
delicate
gives
forth
an
answering
sound
when
its
companion
string
of
the
same
kind
and
nature
of
a
similar
tone
and
strung
on
another
lyre
is
caressed
by
a
skilled
hand
which
while
playing
can
drive
the
turbulent
spirit
out
of
a
possessed
and
hardened
saul
the
history
of
the
early
church
seals
this
with
the
noteworthy
examples
of
genesius
and
ardaleo
both
actors
enlightened
in
the
theatre
by
the
holy
ghost
and
there
converted
for
they
while
playing
wishing
to
mock
the
christian
religion
were
convicted
of
the
truth
which
they
had
learned
out
of
their
serious
rôles
filled
with
the
pith
of
wisdom
rather
than
with
trifling
discourse
to
be
mouthed
for
hours
into
the
air
and
more
vexatious
than
instructive
they
tell
us
in
regard
to
biblical
subject
matter
that
we
should
not
with
holy
things
and
indeed
this
seems
to
have
some
show
of
plausibility
in
our
language
which
hath
given
us
the
word
but
he
that
can
stammer
but
a
word
or
two
of
greek
knows
that
among
the
greeks
and
latins
this
word
was
not
used
in
this
sense
for
is
a
compound
word
and
really
means
a
after
the
lyric
contests
of
the
shepherds
instituted
for
the
purpose
of
winning
a
goat
by
singing
in
which
custom
the
tragic
songs
and
following
them
dramatic
plays
took
their
origin
and
if
one
would
nevertheless
unmercifully
bring
us
to
task
on
account
of
this
word
what
then
shall
be
done
with
organ
david
harp
and
song
and
the
on
the
instrument
with
ten
strings
and
the
other
kinds
of
play
on
flute
and
stringed
instruments
introduced
by
various
sects
among
the
protestants
into
their
meetings
he
then
who
appreciates
this
distinction
will
while
condemning
the
abuses
of
the
dramatic
art
not
be
ungracious
towards
the
proper
use
of
the
same
nor
will
he
begrudge
the
youth
and
the
burghers
this
glorious
yea
this
divine
invention
to
them
an
honorable
recreation
and
a
refreshing
amelioration
of
the
trials
of
life
so
that
we
hereby
encouraged
may
with
greater
zeal
bring
lucifer
upon
the
stage
where
he
finally
smitten
by

plunges
down
into

all
ungrateful

from
the
fruit

and

which
even
god
himself
hath
blessed
and
planted
for
mankind
delight
belzebub
i
see
the
golden
leaves
all
laden
with
ethereal
pearls
the
sparkling
silvery
dew
what
sweet
perfume
exhale
those
radiant
leaves
of
tint
unfading
how
alluring
glows
that
pleasant
fruit
with
crimson
and
with
gold
pity
to
pollute
it
with
the
hands
the
eye
doth
tempt
the
mouth
who
would
not
lust
for
earthly
luxury
he
loathes
our
day
and
food
celestial
who
the
fruit
may
pluck
of
earth
one
would
for
adam
garden
curse
our
paradise
the
bliss
of

fades
in
that
of
man
apollion
too
true
lord
belzebub
though
high
our
heaven
may
seem
is
far
too
low
for
what
i
saw
with
mine
own
eyes
deceives
me
not
the
world
delights
yea
eden
fields
alone
our
paradise
excel
belzebub
proceed
we
hear
what
thou
shalt
say
we
hear
together
apollion
i
pass
my
journey
thither
by
nor
tell
how
downward
sweeping
through
nine
spheres
i
sped
that
swift
as
arrows
round
their
centre
whirl
the
wheel
of
sense
revolves
within
our
thoughts
not
with
such
speed
as
i
beneath
the
moon
and
clouds
dropped
down
where
then
aloft
i
hung
on
floating
pinions
to
survey
that
shore
that
eastern
landscape
far
that
marks
the
face
of
that
great
sphere
the
flowing
ocean
rounds
wherein
so
many
kinds
of
monsters
swarm
afar
i
saw
a
lofty
mount
emerge
from
which
a
waterfall
fount
of
four
streams
dashed
with
a
roar
into
the
vale
below
headlong
i
steered
my
course
oblique
with
steep
descent
until
i
gained
the
mountain
brow
whence
resting
all
the
nether
world
i
viewed
its
happy
fields
and
glowing
opulence
illustration
i
see
golden
leaves
all
laden
with
ethereal
pearls
the
sparkling
silvery
dew
belzebub
now
picture
us
the
garden
and
its
shape
apollion
round
is
the
garden
as
the
world
itself
above
the
centre
looms
the
mount
from
which
the
fountain
gushes
that
divides
in
four
and
waters
all
the
land
refreshing
trees
and
fields
and
flows
in
unreflective
rills
of
crystal
purity
the
streams
their
rich
alluvion
bring
and
nourish
all
the
ground
here
onyx
gleams
and
bdellion
doth
shine
and
bright
as
heaven
glows
with
glittering
stars
so
here
dame
nature
sowed
her
constellations
of
stones
that
pale
our
stars
here
dazzle
veins
of
gold
for
nature
wished
to
gather
all
her
treasures
in
one
lap
belzebub
what
of
the
air
that
hovers
round
whereby
that
creature
lives
apollion
no
angel
us
among
a
breath
exhales
so
soft
and
sweet
as
the
pure
draught
refreshing
that
there
meets
man
that
lightly
cools
his
face
and
with
its
gentle
vivifying
touch
all
things
caresses
in
its
blissful
course
there
swells
the
bosom
of
the
fertile
field
with
herb
and
hue
and
bud
and
branch
and
bloom
and
odors
manifold
which
nightly
dews
refresh
the
rising
and
the
setting
sun
know
and
observe
their
proper
measured
time
and
so
unto
the
need
of
every
plant
temper
their
mighty
rays
that
flower
and
fruit
are
all
within
the
selfsame
season
found
belzebub
now
tell
me
of
man
features
and
his
form
apollion
who
would
our
state
for
that
of
man
prefer
when
one
beholdeth
beings
beneath
whose
sway
all
other
beings
stand
i
saw
a
hundred
thousand
creatures
move
before
me
there
all
they
that
tread
the
earth
and
they
that
cleave
the
clouds
or
swim
the
stream
as
is
their
wont
each
in
his
element
who
should
the
nature
and
the
attributes
of
each
one
know
as
adam
for
was
he
that
gave
them
one
by
one
their
various
names
the
wagged
his
tail
and
smiled
upon
his
lord
and
at
his
sovereign
feet
the
tiger
too
his
fierceness
laid
the
bull
bowed
low
his
horns
the
elephant
his
trunk
the
bear
forgot
his
rage
the
griffin
heard
his
call
the
eagle
and
the
dragon
dread
behemoth
and
even
great
leviathan
nor
shall
i
tell
what
praise
rings
in
man
ears
amid
those
warbling
bowers
replete
with
songs
in
many
tongues
while
zephyrs
rustle
through
the
leaves
and
brooks
purl
their
sylvan
banks
a
murmurous
harmony
that
wearies
never
had
but
apollion
his
mission
then
accomplished
sooth
in
adam
paradise
he
soon
had
lost
all
memory
of
heaven
belzebub
but
what
pray
of
the
twain
thou
sawest
there
apollion
no
creature
hath
on
high
mine
eye
so
pleased
as
those
below
who
could
so
subtly
soul
with
body
weave
and
angels
form
from
clay
and
bone
the
body
shapely
mould
attests
the
maker
art
that
in
the
face
the
mirror
of
the
mind
doth
best
appear
but
wonderful
upon
the
face
is
stamped
the
image
of
the
soul
all
beauty
here
concentres
while
a
god
looks
through
the
eyes
above
the
whole
the
reasoning
soul
doth
hover
and
while
the
dumb
and
brutish
beasts
all
look
down
towards
their
feet
man
proudly
lifts
alone
his
head
to
heaven
in
lofty
praise
to
god
belzebub
his
praise
is
not
in
vain
for
gifts
so
rare
apollion
he
rules
even
like
a
god
whom
all
must
serve
the
invisible
soul
consists
of
spirit
and
not
of
matter
and
it
rules
in
every
limb
the
brain
it
makes
its
seat
and
there
holds
court
it
is
immortal
nor
fears
aught
of
rust
or
other
injury
is
past
our
sense
knowledge
and
prudence
virtue
and
are
its
possessions
dumb
all
spirits
stand
before
its
majesty
ere
long
the
world
shall
teem
with
men
it
waits
from
little
seed
a
harvest
rich
in
souls
and
therefore
god
did
man
to
woman
join
belzebub
now
say
me
how
thou
dost
regard
his
rib
his
lovèd
spouse
apollion
i
covered
with
my
wings
mine
eyes
and
face
that
i
might
curb
my
thoughts
and
deep
delight
when
erst
she
filled
my
gaze
as
adam
led
her
into
their
arborous
bower
with
gentle
hand
from
time
to
time
he
stopped
in
contemplation
and
gazing
thus
a
holy
fire
began
his
pure
breast
to
inflame
and
then
he
kissed
his
bride
and
she
her
bridegroom
thus
on
joy
their
nuptials
fed
on
feasts
of
fiery
love
better
imagined
far
than
told
a
bliss
divine
beyond
all
angel
ken
how
poor
our
loneliness
for
us
no
union
sweet
of
sex
of
maiden
and
of
man
alas
how
much
of
good
we
miss
we
know
no
mate
or
happy
marriage
in
a
heaven
devoid
of
woman
belzebub
thus
in
time
a
world
of
men
shall
be
begotten
there
below
apollion
the
love
of
beauty
fashioned
in
the
brain
deeply
impressèd
by
the
senses
keen
this
makes
their
union
strong
their
life
consists
alone
in
loving
and
in
being
loved
one
sweet
one
mutual
joy
by
them
indulged
perpetually
yet
unquenchable
belzebub
now
picture
me
the
bride
described
from
life
apollion
that
nature
pencil
needs
nor
lesser
hues
than
sunbeams
perfect
are
both
man
and
wife
of
equal
beauty
they
from
head
to
foot
by
right
doth
adam
eve
excel
in
strength
of
form
and
majesty
of
bearing
as
one
chosen
for
the
sovereignty
of
earth
but
eve
combines
all
that
her
bridegroom
joys
a
tenderness
of
limb
and
softer
skin
and
flesh
a
lovelier
tint
and
eyes
enchanting
a
charming
gracious
mouth
a
sweeter
voice
whose
power
lies
in
a
sound
more
exquisite
two
founts
of
ivory
and
what
besides
no
tongue
should
dare
to
name
lest
spirits
should
be
tempted
and
though
all
the
angels
now
impress
our
eyes
as
beautiful
and
fair
how
ill
their
forms
and
faces
would
appear
if
seen
within
the
rosy
of
maidenhood
illustration
perfect
are
both
man
and
wife
of
equal
beauty
they
from
head
to
foot
belzebub
it
seems
that
passion
for
this
feminine
creature
hath
thy
heart
inflamed
apollion
in
that
delightful
blaze
my
great
i
singed
most
hard
it
was
for
me
to
rise
and
wheel
my
way
to
this
our
high
abode
i
parted
though
with
pain
and
thrice
turned
back
my
gaze
there
shines
no
seraph
in
the
courts
celestial
here
on
high
as
she
amid
her
hanging
hair
that
forms
a
golden
niche
of
sunbeams
that
in
beauteous
waves
roll
down
from
her
fair
head
and
flow
along
her
back
so
even
as
from
a
light
she
comes
to
view
and
day
rejoices
with
her
radiant
face
though
pearl
and
seem
purity
her
whiteness
even
theirs
surpasses
far
belzebub
what
profits
human
glory
if
even
as
a
flower
of
the
field
it
fades
and
dies
apollion
so
long
their
garden
fruit
doth
give
shall
this
most
happy
pair
live
by
an
apple
sweet
grown
on
the
central
tree
that
nurture
finds
beside
the
stream
that
laves
its
tender
roots
this
wondrous
tree
is
called
the
tree
of
life
is
incorruptible
and
through
it
man
joys
life
eterne
and
all
immortal
things
while
of
his
angel
brothers
he
becomes
the
peer
yea
and
shall
in
the
end
surpass
them
all
until
his
power
and
sway
and
realm
spread
over
all
for
who
can
clip
his
wings
no
angel
hath
the
power
to
multiply
his
being
a
thousand
thousand
times
in
swarms
innumerable
now
do
thou
calculate
what
shall
from
this
in
time
the
outcome
be
belzebub
great
is
man
might
that
thus
even
ours
apollion
soon
shall
his
increase
frighten
and
astound
though
now
his
sway
stoops
lower
than
the
moon
and
though
is
now
determinate
he
shall
yet
higher
rise
and
place
himself
upon
the
highest
seat
in
heaven
if
god
prevent
not
this
how
then
can
we
prevent
it
for
god
loves
man
well
and
for
him
made
all

belzebub
what
hear
i
there
a
trumpet
surely
then
a

will
follow

while
we
here
await
apollion
the
archangel
gabriel
is
at

and
in

the
choristers
of

in
the
name
of
him
the

to
unfold
as
herald
from
the
towering
throne
of

what
there
him
was
enjoined
belzebub
we
please
to
hear
whatever
the
archangel
shall
command
gabriel
chorus
of
angels
gabriel
give
ear
ye
angels
all
give
ear
ye
hosts
of
heaven
the
highest
goodness
from
whose
breast
flow
all
things
good
and
all
things
holy
who
of
his
beneficence
wearied
grows
and
of
whose
teeming
grace
the
riches
never
shall
know
decrease
whose
might
and
being
transcend
the
comprehension
of
his
creatures
all
this
goodness
in
the
image
of
himself
formed
man
also
the
angels
that
they
might
together
here
with
him
securely
hold
the

eterne
the
good
having
the
while
with
faithfulness
maintained
his
firm
prescribed
law
he
also
built
this
wondrous
universe
the
world
below
made
manifest
and
meet
for
god
and
man
that
in
this
garden
man
might
rule
and
there
might
multiply
acknowledge
god
with
all
his
seed
him
ever
serve
and
revere
and
thus
mount
up
by
the
stairway
of
the
world
the
firmament
of
beatific
light
within
into
the
glow
though
spirits
may
seem
above
all
other

yet
god
hath
decreed
even
from

that
man
shall
high
exalted
be
even
the

him
destined
for
a

and
a

so
be
ye
faithful

sacrilege
their

bears
his

thee
and
who
can
by
declaring
reveal
thy
name
and
who
make
known
thine
oracles
who
is
so
daring
he
who
thou
art
thou
art
alone
save
thee
none

who

thy

who

to

the

of

what
hid
behind
thy
sacred

from
us
thy
mercy
hath
concealèd
such
bliss
transcends
the
narrow
pale
of
our
weak

our
life
is
waning
but
thine
lord
shall
know
endless
days
our
being
in
thine
finds
its
sustaining
exalt
the

sing
his
praise
holy
holy
once
more
holy
three
times
holy

god
without
him
is
nothing
holy
holy
is
his
mighty
nod
strong
in
mystery
he
reigneth
his
commands
our
tongues
compel
to
proclaim
what
he
ordaineth
what
the
faithful
gabriel
with
his
trumpet
came
expounding
praise
of
man
to
god
redounding
all
that
pleaseth
god
is
well
act
ii
lucifer
belzebub
lucifer
ye
speedy
spirits
stay
our
chariot
now
god
in
its
full
zenith
stands
its
height
is
reached
and
lo
the
moment
comes
when
lucifer
must
set
before
this
star
this
double
star
that
rises
from
below
and
seeks
the
way
above
to
tarnish
heaven
with
earthly
glow
no
more
should
ye
adorn
proud
lucifer
apparel
with
glittering
crowns
nor
gild
his
forehead
with
the
glorious
dawn
of
to
which
archangels
kneel
another
splendor
sweeps
into
the
light
of
god
whose
radiance
drowns
our
vaunted
glory
as
to
the
eyes
of
man
below
the
sun
by
day
puts
out
the
stars
the
shades
of
night
bedim
the
angels
and
the
suns
of
heaven
for
man
hath
won
the
heart
of
the
most
high
within
his
paradise
he
is
the
friend
of
heaven
our
slavery
even
now
begins
go
hence
rejoice
and
serve
and
honor
this
new
race
like
servile
slaves
for
god
was
man
created
we
for
him
let
then
the
angels
bend
their
necks
beneath
his
feet
let
each
one
now
upon
him
wait
and
bear
him
even
unto
the
highest
thrones
on
hands
or
wings
for
our
inheritance
shall
pass
to
him
the
chosen
son
of
god
we
the
shall
suffer
in
this
realm
the
son
born
on
that
day
the
sixth
and
made
in
the
image
of
the
father
shall
attain
the
crown
and
rightly
unto
him
was
given
the
mighty
sceptre
which
shall
cause
even
us
the
ones
first
born
to
tremble
and
to
shake
here
holds
no
contradiction
now
ye
heard
what
gabriel
trump
spake
at
the
golden
port
belzebub
o
stadtholder
of
god
superior
powers
alas
we
hear
too
well
amid
the
praise
of
choristers
a
discord
that
makes
sad
the
feast
eterne
the
charge
of
gabriel
is
clear
it
needs
no
tongue
of
cherubim
to
unfold
its
sense
nor
was
there
need
to
send
apollion
below
a
nearer
view
to
gain
of
adam
realm
beneath
the
moon
how
gloriously
the
godhead
dealt
with
him
doth
well
appear
he
hath
for
his
defence
even
given
a
many
thousands
strong
while
he
supports
his
rank
and
dignity
as
if
he
were
the
supreme
chief
of
spirits
the
massive
gate
of
heaven
stands
ajar
for
adam
seed
an
that
hath
crawled
out
of
the
dust
out
of
a
clod
of
clay
defies
thy
power
thou
shalt
yet
man
behold
thee
exalted
so
that
thou
shalt
fall
upon
thy
knees
and
there
abased
adore
with
drooping
eyes
his
lofty
eminence
his
power
and
high
authority
he
shall
when
glorified
by
the
omnipotent
yet
seat
himself
even
by
the
side
of
god
empowered
to
reign
beyond
the
farthest
rounds
and
endless
circles
of
eternity
that
from
the
bounds
of
time
and
space
set
free
revolve
unceasingly
around
one
god
who
is
their
centre
and
circumference
what
clearer
proof
need
we
to
see
that
god
shall
glorify
mankind
and
us
degrade
for
we
were
born
to
serve
and
man
to
rule
then
henceforth
put
the
sceptre
from
thy
hand
there
is
another
one
below
who
reigns
or
soon
shall
reign
put
off
thy
morning
rays
and
wreaths
of
light
before
this
sun
or
else
have
care
to
bring
him
in
with
songs
of
joy
and
triumph
and
with
honors
full
divine
we
soon
shall
see
the
heavens
changed
in
state
behold
the
stars
look
out
and
from
their
paths
retreat
aglow
with
longing
to
receive
with
reverence
this
new
and
coming
light
lucifer
that
shall
i
thwart
if
in
my
power
it
be
belzebub
there
hear
i
lucifer
and
him
behold
who
from
heaven
face
can
drive
the
night
away
where
he
appears
day
glory
dawns
anew
his
crescent
light
the
first
and
nighest
god
shall
grow
dim
his
word
is
stern
command
his
will
and
nod
a
law
by
none
transgressed
the
godhead
is
in
him
obeyed
and
served
praised
honored
and
adored
should
then
a
voice
more
faint
than
his
now
thunder
from
god
throne
than
his
be
more
obeyed
should
god
exalt
a
younger
son
begot
of
adam
loins
even
over
him
that
would
most
violate
the
heirship
of
the
and
rob
his
splendor
of
its
rays
god
himself
none
is
so
great
as
thou
the
godhead
once
set
thee
the
first
in
glory
at
his
feet
then
let
not
man
dare
thus
our
order
great
profane
nor
thus
cast
down
these
vested
rights
without
a
cause
or
all
of

shall
spring
to

one
illustration
thou
shalt
not

thee
exalted
son
that
thou
shalt
fall
upon
thy
knees
and
there
abased
adore
with
drooping
eyes
his
lofty

lucifer
indeed
thou
sayest
well
it
is
not
meet
for
dominations
grave
powers
in
state
thus
to
give
up
so
loosely
their
established
rights
and
since
the
supreme
power
is
by
his
laws
most
bound
to
change
becomes
him
least
am
i
a
son
of

a
ruler
of
the

my
place
i
shall
maintain
to
no
usurper
bow
not
even
this
let
all
yield
who
will
not
one
foot
shall
i
retreat
here
is
my
fatherland
nor
hardships
dire
nor
yet
disaster
nor
anathemas
shall
me
intimidate
or
tame
to
die
or
to
gain
port
around
this
dreadful
cape
this
is
my
destiny
doth
fate
decree
that
i
must
fall
of
rank
and
honors
shorn
then
let
me
fall
but
fall
with
this
my
crown
upon
my
brow
this
sceptre
in
my
grasp
with
my
own
retinue
of
faithful
troops
and
with
these
many
thousands
on
my
side
aye
thus
to
fall
brings
honor
and
shall
shed
unfading
glory
on
my
name
besides
to
be
the
first
prince
in
some
lower
court
is
better
than
within
the
blessed
light
to
be
the
second
or
even
less
is
thus
i
weigh
the
stroke
nor
harm
nor
hindrance
fear
but
here
hardby
comes
heaven
interpreter
and
herald
vigilant
with
god
own
book
of
mysteries
committed
to
his
care
most
opportune
for
us
his
coming
hither
for
i
would
question
him
i
shall
accost
him
then
and
from
my
chariot
descend
gabriel
lucifer
gabriel
lord
stadtholder
how
whither
bound
lucifer
to
thee
o
herald
and
interpreter
of
heaven
gabriel
methinks
i
read
thy
purpose
on
thy
brow
lucifer
thou
who
canst
fathom
and
who
canst
reveal
through
the
light
of
thy
mind
eye
the
shadowy
mysteries
of
god
relieve
me
with
thy
coming
gabriel
what
doth
burden
thee
lucifer
the
late
decision
of
the
ruling
powers
the
new
decree
made
by
the
godhead
who
esteems
celestial
joys
as
of
less
worth
than
earthly
elements
oppresses
heaven
even
from
the
low
abyss
the
earth
exalts
above
the
stars
sets
man
high
in
the
seat
of
the
angels
whom
shorn
of
primordial
powers
he
then
commands
for
human
happiness
to
sweat
and
slave
the
spirits
once
consecrate
to
service
in
empyreal
palaces
shall
serve
an
that
from
out
the
dust
hath
crawled
and
grown
and
on
his
bidding
wait
and
see
him
them
excel
in
rank
and
numbers
why
doth
the
endless
mercy
us
degrade
so
soon
what
angel
hath
forgot
to
render
due
reverence
how
could
the
deity
mingle
with
base
mankind
and
thus
pass
by
the
nature
of
his
chosen
angels
here
while
his
own
nature
and
his
being
he
pours
into
a
body
thus
eternity
unite
with
its
beginning
time
and
what
is
highest
to
what
is
lowest
of
the
low
the
great
creator
to
his
creature
bind
who
can
the
import
glean
of
this
decree
shall
now
eternity
bright
quenchless
sun
set
in
the
gathering
darkness
of
the
world
shall
we
the
stadtholder
of
god
thus
kneel
before
this
shadow
power
this
puny
lord
and
see
the
countless
hosts
of
souls
divine
and
incorporeal
bow
themselves
before
a
gross
and
sluggish
element
upon
which
god
hath
stamped
his
being
and
majesty
we
spirits
are
yet
too
gross
to
comprehend
this
mystery
thou
who
the
key
dost
guard
of
god
rich
of
mysteries
unlock
if
so
thou
mayest
this
secret
dark
from
out
thy
sealèd
book
unfold
to
us
the
will
of
heaven
gabriel
as
much
as
is
to
us
permitted
to
unfold
out
of

book
much
knowledge
doth
not
profit
one
alway
indeed
may
damage
bring

what
he

most
fit
the
inner

even
seraphim
the
spotless
wisdom

in

conceal
in

unto
a

this

unto
his

charge
stands
bound

which
secret
we
shall
know
when
first
shall
pass
a

in

both
god

shall
divulge

his

thou
now

then
on

a
worm
an
alien
wield
the
greatest
power
must
they
who
native
are
to

thus
yield
to
foreign

shall
man
then
found

even
the

of

content
thee
with
thy
lot
the
rank

once
granted
thee
by

for
thee
he
made
the

not

rebellion
flattens
both
her
crown

she
rears
her

god

thy
splendor
owes
its
lustre
to
god
power
alone
lucifer
till
now
my
crown
hath
bowed
to
none
but
god
gabriel
then
also
bow
before
this
last
decree
of
god
who
leadeth
all
that
have
their
being
from
naught
yea
all
that
shall
live
unto
their
end
and
certain
destiny
though
we
may
fail
to
comprehend
his
plan
lucifer
thus
to
see
man
into
the
light
of
god
exalted
to
behold
him
deified
with
god
on
his
high
throne
to
see
towards
him
the
censers
swinging
the
joyous
tones
of
thousand
thousand
holy
choristers
with
one
voice
pealing
symphonies
of
praise
such
grandeur
doth
bedim
the
lofty
splendors
and
diamond
rays
of
our
own
that
dazzles
then
no
more
while
heaven
joy
shall
pine
in
grief
away
gabriel
the
highest
bliss
alone
in
calm
contentment
can
be
found
and
in
agreement
with
god
will
in
full
compliance
with
his
law
lucifer
the
majesty
of
god
and
of
the
godhead
is
debased
if
with
the
blood
of
man
his
nature
ever
unites
combines
or
otherwise
is
bound
we
spirits
to
god
and
his
deep
nature
come
far
closer
as
children
from
one
father
sprung
and
are
like
him
if
unto
us
it
be
allowed
to
bring
in
such
similitude
this
inequality
of
endless
powers
with
those
determinate
of
definite
might
with
might
indefinite
should
once
the
sun
err
from
his
orbit
path
and
veil
himself
behind
a
mist
to
light
the
globe
of
earth
through
clouds
of
smoke
and
darkling
damps
how
soon
the
joys
of
earth
would
die
how
would
the
race
below
then
want
all
light
and
life
how
too
the
sun
would
lack
his
dazzling
majesty
circling
his
daily
round
i
see
the
skies
piled
up
with
gloom
the
stars
confused
with
fright
disorders
fell
and
chaos
where
now
law
and
order
reign
should
once
the
fount
of
light
plunge
with
its
splendors
into
some
dark
fen
think
not
too
harshly
then
i
do
beseech
thee
gabriel
if
now
thy
trumpet
voice
the
law
given
by
the
high
command
i
do
resist
or
seemingly
oppose
we
strive
for
god
own
honor
yea
to
give
to
god
his
right
should
i
become
thus
daring
and
wander
far
beyond
the
narrow
path
of
my
obedience
gabriel
thou
art
indeed
most
zealous
for
the
glory
of
god
name
though
truly
without
weighing
well
that
god
the
point
wherein
his
majesty
doth
lie
far
better
knows
than
we
cease
therefore
now
this
inquisition
for
when
god
as
man
shall
have
become
he
shall
this
book
of
his
own
mysteries
now
sealed
with
seven
seals
himself
unseal
to
taste
the
kern
within
is
not
for
thee
thou
seest
the
shell
alone
then
of
this
long
concealment
we
shall
learn
the
cause
and
hidden
reason
all
the
while
in
the
unveiled
holy
of
holies
it
now
behooves
us
ever
to
obey
and
to
revere
this
rising
dawn
to
use
our
light
with
thankfulness
until
the
time
when
knowledge
in
her
power
shall
drive
all
doubt
away
even
as
the
sun
the
night
now
learn
we
gradually
with
modest
reverence
god
wisdom
to
approach
and
this
to
us
reveals
by
slow
degrees
the
light
of
truth
and
knowledge
and
requires
that
on
his
watch
each
shall
submit
himself
to
reason
rule
lord
stadtholder
be
calm
be
foremost
thou
now
to
maintain
the
law

sends
me
hence
i
must
away
lucifer
i
shall
observe
it
well
belzebub
lucifer
belzebub
the
stadtholder
now
hears
the
meaning
of
this
proclamation
grave
so
proudly
blown
by
gabriel
trumpet
bold
how
well
he
showed
thee
god
design
whose
purpose
thou
scent

thy
great

here
hardby
comes

but
not
so
easily
ah
nay
forsooth
i
shall
have

venture
all
to
raise
my
seat
amid
the
firmament
the
spheres
the
splendor
of

then
my

rainbow
be
my
throne
the
starry
vast
my
court
while
down
beneath

proud
in
their
towering
masonry

burst
with

and
dissolve
before
our
eyes

deep
so
far

his

there
like
feeble
worms
already
crawling
in

i
joy
to

this

violence

thus
to
hazard
by
one
strong
opposing
stroke
the

an

i

thus
to

thee
the
prosecution
of
a
cause
so
bold
let
this
result
for
better

for
worse
the
will
is
noble
even
though
it
fail

lest
we
strive
in

and
recklessly
how
best
shall
we
begin
so
bold
a

how
safest
meet
the
point
of
that

we
subtly
shall
oppose

there
is

is

weighed
in

against

guard
well
thy
crown
for
we
fall
far
too
light
belzebub
yet
not
so
light
but
that
the
matter
first
shall
hang
in
doubt
apollion
by
whom
or
how
or
where
this
plot
begun
even
such
intent
is
treason
god

lucifer
his
throne
we
not
disturb
but
cautiously
mount
up
the

and
those
high

and

climb
courage
and
prudence
must
at
length
and
dare
all
dangers
brave
apollion
but
not
the

omnipotent
nor
yet
his
crown
approach
thou
not
too
near
or
learn
in
sorrow
that
repentance
comes
too

submissively
unto
the

yield
lucifer
the

is
far
beyond

set

then
learn
whose

our
enemies
in

ours
by
one
courageous
stroke

move
itself
the

nor

easy
to

in
such

to
engage
exceeds
our

drags
a

in

thou

here
shines
the

too

this

then
it
were
most
opportune

belzebub

should
tender
them
his

to
force
their

gain
redress
of

not
all
at

gradually
as

let
the

himself
approach

in

of
such
a
proud
resolve
offer
his
mighty

apollion
we
soon
shall
hear
when
in

council
his

at

spur

maddened

belial
upon
the

the
whole

whatever
thy

did

this

our

the
angels
now
defend
their

and
here
against
their

contend
is
indiscretion
called
michael
o
kind
ye
are
no
longer
sons
of
light
but
rather
are
a
bastard
race
which
yields
not
even

provoke
the
lightning
stroke
and
wrath
implacable
harden
your

ye
should
therefore
at
once
deliberate
helpless

as
to
myself
the
post
is
far
too
grave
lucifer
afar
and
wide
the

and
shake
with
the
sound
of
your
disputes
the
legions
stand
divided
split
in

the

our
great

enjoins
much
prudence
here
disaster
to
prevent
luciferians
lord

sure
we
hope
that
thou
shalt
as
michael
doom
the
neck
of
the
angels
to
be
thrust
the
feet
of
adam
brood
and
then
as
he
go
gild
and
bloom
this
shame
and
insult
with
the
show
of
equity
and
with
thy
might
sustain
the
bold
ascent
of
man
this
gross
and
race
to
god
by
him
so
seldom
seen
what
incense
brings
he
why
stand
we
charged
to
serve
a
worm
so
base
to
bear
him
on
our
hands
to
heed
his
voice
made
god
the
boundless

then
for
him
alone
better
far
had
we
never
been

sooth
had
we
never
been
oh
pity
lucifer
do
not
permit
our
order
now
so
low
to
be
abased
and
guiltless
to
decline
while
man
thus
made
the
chief
of
angels
shall
shine
and
glow
amid
the
splendor
inaccessible
before
which
seraphim
as
shadows
fade
with
dreadful
trembling
if
condescend
so
great
injustice
in
this
realm
to
quell
and
shalt
maintain
our
rights
we

together
to

thy

by
force
in
majesty
undimmed
to
set
thee
on

no

all

is

though
in

a

it
were

however
there
is
a
danger
on

gabriel
the

with
the
fierce

and
of
treachery
i
now
command
thee
as
ambassador
from
god
and
his
high
throne
to
rise
without
delay
and
burn
out
with
a
glow
of
fire

polluting

in

lucifer
defies
with

michael
has
lucifer
alas
been
faithless
found
gabriel
the
third
part
of
the
heavens
swore
but
now
the
standard
of
that
fickle
their
firm
allegiance
perfumed
his
throne
with
incense
even
as
if
he
were
a
god
and
with
the
blasphemous
sounds
of
godless
music
him
praises
sang
now
hitherward
they
come
thronging
with
mighty
hordes
that
threaten
all
how
terribly
to
burst
with
violence
the
gate
that
leads
unto
the
armoury
a
crash
of
tempests
fierce
and
wild
doth
roar
on
every
side
the
lightnings
rage
and
rave
the
thunders
in
their
travail
laboring
shake
even
the
ponderous
pillars
of
these
courts
we
hear
no
seraphim
nor
sounds
of
praise
each
sits
apart
enwrapped
in
voiceless
gloom
now
hushed
at
once
are
all
the
angel
choirs
and
then
again
they
cry
aloud
in
grief
and
in
their
pity
this
blind
revolt
of
the
blessed
angel
world
and
the
fall
of
the
angelic
race
aye
is
full
time
that
thou
perform
thy
charge
that
thou
observe
the
sacred
oath
that
thou
as
didst
swear
upon
the
lightning
lurid
edge
by
god
most
holy
name
illustration
each
sits
apart
enwrapped
in
voiceless
gloom
michael
what
then
doth
move
god
stadtholder
thus
to
oppose
himself
against
god
as
the
impious
head
and
chief
of
mad
conspirators
gabriel
the
heavens
know
how
loth
i
am
to
make
in
such
a
way
defence
of
god
most
righteous
cause
but
oh
how
terrible
the
wrath
laid
up
for
him
for
we
can
find
no
means
by
which
to
lead
this
erring
race
of
blind
unfortunates
along
the
road
the
of
their
faith
myself
saw
there
the
radiant
joy
of
god
itself
with
a
gathering
cloud
of
mournfulness
until
at
last
his
wrath
a
flame
enkindled
in
his
eyes
of
light
ere
he
to
ward
the
threatened
blow
gave
charge
unto
this
expedition
i
then
heard
awhile
the
plea
how
there
in
equipoise
god
mercy
stood
against
his
righteousness
by
weight
of
reason
held
i
saw
too
how
the
cherubim
upon
their
faces
fallen
cried
with
one
voice
oh
mercy
mercy
lord
not
justice
give
this
dire
dispute
had
thus
been
expiated
yea
almost
so
much
seemed
god
to
mercy
then
inclined
and
reconciliation
but
as
up
the
smell
of
incense
rose
the
smoke
beneath
to
lucifer
from
countless
censers
swung
amid
the
sounds
of
trump
and
choral
praise
the
heavens
their
eyes
averted
from
such
sight
and
such
idolatry
accursed
of
god
and
spirit
and
all
the
hierarchies
above
then
mercy
took
its
flight
awake
to
arms
the
godhead
summons
thee
ere
the
tumult
us
surprise
to
tame
by
thine
own
arm
these
fierce
behemoths
and
leviathans
who
thus
most
wickedly
conspire
michael
come
uriel
squire
haste
speedily
and
bring
the
lightnings
here
also
my
armor
helm
and
shield
then
bring
god
banner
on
and
blow
the
trumpet
bold
to
arms
at
once
to
arms
ye
thrones
and
powers
who
true
and
faithful
are
with
us
arrayed
ye
legions
on
each
in
his
place
the
heavens
have
given
command
now
blow
the
trumpet
bold
and
beat
the
hollow
drum
and
summon
here
in
haste
the
countless
cohorts
of
the
armed
blow
then
my
armor
i
put
on
for
here
god
honor
is
concerned
there
no
retreat
gabriel
this
armor
fits
thy
form
as
if
made
with
thee
behold
our
glorious
banner
comes
from
which
god
name
and
ensign
grandly
beam
while
yon
high
sun
doth
promise
thee
success
here
come
the
chiefs
to
greet
thee
as
the
head
of
the
celestial
legions
that
have
sworn
god
standard
to
uphold
take
courage
then
prince
michael
thou
shalt
battle
for
thy
god
michael
aye
aye
keep
thou
my
place
on
high
we
go
gabriel
thy
march
we
follow
with
our
thoughts
and
prayers
lucifer
belzebub
luciferians
lucifer
how
holds
our
army
how
is
it
inclined
belzebub
the
army
longs
prepared
thy
command
to
plunge
at
once
against
michael
armament
luciferians
is
true
each
waits
for
lucifer
command
to
haste
at
once
with
speedy
wings
and
arms
to
steal
away
from
our
great
enemy
his
air
and
wind
and
as
he
lies
confused
in
helpless
swoon
to
chain
him
forcibly
lucifer
how
many
strong
our
host
wherein
our
strength
belzebub
that
grows
apace
and
sweeps
on
toward
us
with
a
rush
and
roar
from
every
firmament
like
a
vast
sea
aglow
with
radiant
lights
indeed
a
third
part
of
the
heavens
embrace
our
side
if
not
the
half
for
michael
tide
on
every
hand
each
moment
swiftly
ebbs
the
half
even
of
the
watch
and
of
the
chiefs
that
round
the
palace
guard
of
every
rank
of
every
hierarchy
some
have
forsworn
their
lord
prince
michael
even
as
we
behold
archangels
cherubim
and
seraphim
our
standards
bearing
even
paradise
made
mournful
by
the
sounds
of
woe
grows
dim
in
hue
and
its
bright
verdure
fades
wherever
the
eye
doth
look
there
seem
signs
of
decay
and
up
above
a
threatening
doth
seem
to
hang
this
portent
bodes
our
bliss
we
need
but
to
begin
already
doth
the
crown
of
heaven
rest
upon
thy
brow
lucifer
that
sound
doth
please
me
more
than
gabriel
trump
attend
and
listen
ye
beneath
this
throne
attend
ye
chiefs
attend
ye
valiant
knights
and
hear
our
charge
in
words
both
clear
and
brief
ye
know
how
far
in
our
revengeful
course
against
the
ruler
of
the
palaces
supreme
we
have
advanced
so
that
it
were
for
us
but
folly
to
retreat
with
hope
of
reconciliation
how
none
dares
to
think
to
purify
through
mercy
this
our
stain
indelible
necessity
must
therefore
be
our
law
a
stronghold
sure
from
which
there
is
no
wavering
nor
retreat
defend
ye
then
looking
back
with
all
your
might
this
standard
and
my
star
in
brief
the
state
all
angels
own
let
things
proceed
they
will
press
on
with
heart
undaunted
and
with
cheerfulness
not
even
the
omnipotence
on
high
hath
power
completely
to
annihilate
the
being
that
ye
have
once
for
all
eternity
received
in
case
ye
fiercely
shall
attack
with
your
whole
force
and
pierce
with
violence
the
heart
of
your
great
foe
and
chance
to
win
so
shall
the
hated
tyranny
of
heaven
into
a
state
of
freedom
then
be
changed
and
adam
son
and
seed
crowned
us
above
in
honor
with
a
retinue
of
earth
around
shall
not
then
chain
your
necks
unto
the
fetters
of
a
slavish
bondage
that
would
make
you
sweat
for
him
and
pant
beneath
the
brazen
yoke
of
servitude
forever
if
now
ye
own
me
as
the
head
and
chief
of
your
free
state
even
as
just
now
ye
swore
with
one
full
voice
beneath
this
standard
bright
so
raise
that
binding
oath
again
together
that
we
may
hear
and
swear
allegiance
and
loyalty
unto
our
luciferians
we
swear
alike
by
god
and
lucifer
belzebub
but
see
how
rafael
with
the
branch
of
peace
astounded
and
compassionate
flies
down
to
clasp
thy
neck
with
hope
of
peace
and
truce
rafael
lucifer
rafael
oh
stadtholder
voice
of
the
power
divine
what
thus
hath
driven
thee
beyond
the
path
of
duty
wouldst
thou
now
thyself
oppose
to
him
the
source
of
all
thy
pomp
wouldst
thou
now
rashly
waver
and
thus
change
thy
faith
i
hope
this
shall
be
alas
i
faint
with
grief
and
hang
upon
thy
neck
oppressed
and
wan
lucifer
most
righteous
rafael
rafael
o
my
joy
my
longing
hear
me
now
i
pray
lucifer
speak
on
so
long
it
pleaseth
thee
rafael
o
lucifer
be
merciful
oh
i
save
thyself
nor
bear
thy
weapons
thus
me
who
sadly
melt
in
tears
and
pine
in
sorrow
for
thy
sake
i
come
with
medicine
and
mercy
balm
sprung
from
the
bosom
of
the
deity
who
as
within
his
council
he
decreed
hath
made
thee
chief
of
myriad
crowned
powers
and
thee
anointed
placed
upon
thy
throne
as
stadtholder
what
folly
this
that
thus
deprives
thee
of
thy
wit
god
hath
his
seal
and
image
stamped
upon
thy
hallowed
head
and
forehead
where
all
beauty
seemed
outpoured
with
wisdom
and
benevolence
and
all
that
flows
in
streams
unbounded
from
the
fount
of
every
precious
thing
in
paradise
before
the
countenance
of
god
own
sun
thou
from
clouds
of
dew
and
roses
fresh
thy
festal
robes
stood
stiff
with
pearl
turquoise
and
diamond
ruby
emerald
and
fine
gold
was
thy
right
hand
the
weightiest
sceptre
held
and
as
soon
as
thou
didst
mount
into
the
light
throughout
the
blazing
firmament
and
through
these
shining
vaults
the
sounds
began
to
roll
of
trumpet
and
of
drum
and
wouldst
thou
now
so
rashly
hurl
thyself
from
thy
great
throne
thus
jeopardize
thy
glory
all
this
pomp
wouldst
thou
thy
splendors
that
the
heavens
adorn
and
that
obscure
our
glow
so
heedlessly
now
cause
to
change
into
a
shapeless
lump
and
complication
of
all
beasts
and
monsters
in
one
with
claw
of
griffin
dragon
head
and
other
horrors
terrible
and
shall
the
eyes
of
heaven
the
stars
see
thee
so
low
deprived
of
all
thy
power
thy
honor
worth
and
majesty
through
perjuring
thine
oath
prevent
it
o
good
god
whose
countenance
amid
the
blessed
light
i
gaze
upon
where
we
the
hallowed
seven
do
him
serve
before
his
throne
and
shake
and
tremble
that
majesty
that
on
our
forehead
beams
that
quickens
and
that
life
doth
give
to
all
that
live
and
breathe
lord
stadtholder
let
now
my
prayers
affect
thy
heart
thou
my
pure
intent
and
heart
distressed
for
thee
tear
off
that
shining
crest
so
proud
that
armor
toss
aside
the
cast
from
this
hand
thy
shield
then
from
the
other
nay
not
thus
not
higher
oh
throw
it
now
aside
i
pray
oh
cast
it
down
let
fall
thy
streaming
standard
of
thine
own
free
will
also
thine
outstretched
wings
before
god
and
his
splendor
ere
he
shall
from
cut
his
throne
the
highest
firmament
o
honor
swoop
to
grind
thee
into
dust
yea
so
that
of
the
race
of
spirits
nor
branch
nor
root
nor
life
nor
even
memory
remain
unless
it
be
a
state
of
woe
of
pain
of
death
and
of
despair
the
worm
endless
remorse
and
a
gnashing
dire
of
teeth
should
bear
the
name
of
life
submit
thou
then
cease
this
attempt
i
offer
thee
god
grace
even
with
this
accept
or
else
be
too
late
lucifer
lord
rafael
i
nor
threat
nor
wrath
deserve
my
heroes
both
by
god
and
lucifer
have
sworn
and
under
oaths
to
heaven
have
raised
this
standard
thus
aloft
let
rumors
therefore
far
and
wide
be
spread
throughout
the
heavens
i
battle
under
god
for
the
defence
of
these
his
choristers
and
for
the
charter
and
the
rights
which
were
their
lawful
heritage
ere
adam
saw
the
rising
sun
yea
ere
paradise
the
daylight
shone
no
human
power
no
yoke
of
man
shall
plague
the
necks
of
spirits
nor
shall
the
angel
world
like
any
servile
slave
support
the
throne
of
adam
with
its
neck
unfettered
now
unless
in
some
abyss
the
heavens
shall
bury
us
together
with
the
sceptres
crowns
and
splendors
that
to
us
the
godhead
from
his
bosom
gave
for
time
and
for
eternity
let
burst
what
will
i
shall
maintain
the
holy
right
compelled
by
high
necessity
thus
urged
at
length
though
much
against
my
will
by
the
complaints
and
mournful
groans
of
myriad
tongues
go
hence
this
message
bear
unto
the
father
whom
i
serve
and
under
whom
i
thus
unfurl
this
warlike
standard
for
our
fatherland
rafael
o
stadtholder
why
thus
disguise
thy
thoughts
before
the
eye
thy
purpose
thou
canst
not
conceal
the
rays
flashed
from
his
face
lay
bare
the
darkness
the
ambition
that
thy
pregnant
spirit
reveals
in
all
its
shape
and
lo
even
now
its
travail
hath
begun
this
monster
to
bring
forth
where
shall
i
hide
me
in
my
fright
how
rise
my
hairs
with
fear
thou
erring
oh
spare
thyself
thou
canst
not
satisfy
omniscience
with
such
deceit
lucifer
ambition
say
me
then
where
hath
my
duty
suffered
through
neglect
rafael
what
hast
thou
in
thy
heart
of
hearts
resolved
shall
mount
up
from
here
beneath
through
all
the
clouds
aye
even
above
god
galaxies
into
the
top
of
heaven
like
unto
god
himself
nor
shall
the
beams
of
mercy
fall
on
any
power
unless
before
my
seat
it
kneel
in
homage
down
no
majesty
shall
sceptre
dare
nor

shall
first
grant
it

full
of
peace
and
holiness
for
the
first
time

for

formed
a

sadly
thus
abase
for
one
so
low

thus
disrobe

to
curse

rather
that
it

remained
a
shadow
without

a

better
thousand
times
than
such
a
fall
rafael
a

no

it
stands
free
and
apart
lucifer
this
power
is
then
no
boon
if
power
it
may
be
called
rafael
thy
place
maintain
or
hast
thou
then
forgot
thy
charge
thy
place
as
stadtholder
to
thee
was
given
that
in
thy
wisdom
thou
mightst
keep
all
things
in
peace
and
order
here
and
dost
thou
now
the
perjured
chief
of
blind
conspirators
put
on
this
coat
of
mail
to
fight
thy
god
lucifer
necessity
and
compelled
these
arms
nor
wished
we
to
engage
with
god
reason
would
speak
even
though
our
arms
were
dumb
we
fight
in
freedom
cause
denied
this
bliss
rafael
no
bliss
is
glorious
where
in
one
realm
the
embattled
squadrons
of
the
state
must
fight
against
their
peers
most
pitiful
it
is
when
brothers
of
the
selfsame
order
must
at
last
even
by
their
brothers
be
oh
stadtholder
for
our
sake
and
for
fear
of
god
and
of
his
threatened
punishment
send
hence
thy
gathered
legions
send
them
hence
oh
melt
i
pray
beneath
my
prayers
i
hear
is
terrible
the
chains
now
that
thee
shall
drag
when
vanquished
and
bound
in
triumph
through
the
skies
and
hark
i
hear
a
din
and
see
the
hosts
of
michael
draw
with
nearing

is
time
yea
is
high
time
thou
cease
this
mad
attempt
lucifer
what
profits
it
even
though
unto
the
utmost
i
repent
here
is
no
hope
of
grace
rafael
but
i
assure
thee
mercy
for
i
now
appoint
myself
thy
mediator
up
above
and
as
thy
hostage
there
lucifer
my
star
to
plunge
in
shame
and
darkness
yea
to
see
my
enemies
defiant
on
my
throne
rafael
o
lucifer
beware
i
see
the
lake
of
brimstone
down
below
with
opened
mouth
gape
horribly
shalt
thou
the
fairest
far
of
all
things
ever
by

created
henceforth
serve
as
food
for
the
devouring
bowels
of
hell
abyss
flames
never

forbid
oh
oh
yield
to
our
prayers

thee

what
creature
else
so
wretched
is
as
i
on
the
one
side
flicker
feeble
rays
of
hope
while
on
the
other
yawns
a
flaming
horror
a
triumph
is
most
dubious
defeat
most
hard
to
shun
in
such
uncertainty
god
and
his
banner
to
oppose
the
first
to
be
a
standard
to
unfurl
god
his
trump
celestial
and
revealed
command
of
rebels
thus
to
make
myself
the
chief
and
the
law
of
heaven
another
law
to
oppose
to
fall
into
the
dreadful
curse
of
a
most
base
ingratitude
to
wound
the
mercy
love
and
majesty
of
him
the
father
bountiful
source
of
all
good
that
was
given
or
may
yet
be
received
how
have
i
erred
so
far
from
duty
path
i
have
abjured
my
maker
how
can
i
before
that
light
disguise
my
blasphemy
and
wickedness
retreat
availeth
not
nay
i
have
gone
too
far
what
remedy
what
best
to
do
amid
this
hopelessness
the
time
brooks
no
delay
one
moment
time
is
not
enough
if
time
it
may
be
called
this
brevity
bliss
and
endless
doom
but
is
too
late
no
cleansing
for
my
stain
is
here
all
hope
is
past
what
remedy
hark
i
there
i
hear
god
trumpet
blow
without
apollion

apollion
lord
stadtholder
awake
not
now
the
time
for
loitering
god
marshal
michael
nears
with
all
his
stars
and
legions
and
defies
thee
in
the
open
field
the
time
demands
that
thou
array
for
battle
come
advance
advance
with
us
we
see
the
battle
won
lucifer
won
ah
that
is
too
soon
is
not
commenced
the
heavy
bolt
of
war
should
not
be
weighed
too
lightly
apollion
i
saw
even
in
michael
face
the
hue
of
fright
while
all
his
legions
pale
looked
backwards
ah
we
long
o
doubt
it
not
to
humble
and
destroy
them
lo
here
come
the
various
chieftains
with
our
streaming
standard
lucifer
each
in
his
rank
let
each
his
banner
ward
now
let
the
trump
and
bugle
boldly
blow
apollion
we
wait
upon
thy
word
lucifer
then
follow
on
as
i
this
signal
give
rafael
alas
but
now
he
stood
in
doubt
suspended
now
despair
incites
him
on
in
what
calamities
alas
shall
soon
the
proud
archangel
plunge
his
followers
now
may
he
nevermore
in
joy
appear
on
high
unless
god
shall
in
his
compassion
this
prevent
oh
come
ye
heavenly
choristers
and
breathe
your
prayers
it
may
be
that
your
supplications
rising
may
yet
avert
this
dire
impending
blow
oft
prayer
can
break
a
heart
of
adamant
chorus
of
angels
rafael
chorus
o
father
who
no
incense
gold
or
hymnal
praise
dost
dearer
hold
than
the
tranquil
trust
and
calmness
of
him
who
humbly
heeds
thy
word
and
where
thy
spirit
leads
doth
leave
himself
in
thy
disposing
thou
seest
o
author
of
us
all
our
his
banners
tall
thee
so
wickedly
unfurling
and
how
roar
of
trump
and
drum
on
he
doth
come
so
blind
and
fierce
defiance
hurling
ah
heed
not
their
wild
blasphemy
and
save
from
endless
misery
the
thousand
thousand
ones
deluded
who
weak
and
woefully
misled
by
their
proud
and
rebellious
head
are
his
legions
now
included

spare
in
thy
mercy
spare
ah
spare
the
stadtholder
who
now
would
wear
thy
crown
of
crowns
who
deifying
himself
would
triumph
over
all
from
such
foul
stain
oh
where
else
shall
the
cleansing
come
him
purifying
chorus
oh
suffer
not
that
soul
to
die
the
fairest
seen
by
thine
eye
oh
i
keep
the
archangel
in
heaven
let
him
atone
this
impious
deed
and
still
retain
his
rank

listen
then
in
expectation
rapt
uriel
your
wish
inflames
my
spirit
to
begin
this
fearful
fray
in
calmness
to
describe
with
sequence
just
success
the
army
crowns
that
fights
with
god
the
great
michael
being
warned
by
the
envoy
of
heaven
who
from
above
flew
downward
downward
swifter
than
a
star
that
shoots
athwart
the
sky
with
the
tidings
how
against
the
high
decree
proud
lucifer
himself
so
openly
opposed
prepared
to
lead
his
worshippers
all
who
his
standard
and
his
had
sworn
their
bold
allegiance
quickly
donned
at
gabriel
report
that
herald
true
his
scaly
coat
of
mail
and
with
firm
voice
he
forthwith
then
gave
charge
to
all
his
chiefs
his
captains
lords
and
officers
to
place
in
the
name
of
god
the
troops
in
battle
rank
that
with
united
forces
and
with
all
their
strength
they
might
sweep
from
the
airy
vast
of
purest
crystalline
this
perjured
scum
to
cast
in
darkness
all
those
spirits
vile
ere
unawares
they
us
surprise
upon
this
charge
the
legions
rapidly
deployed
themselves
in
as
speedily
as
flies
the
nimble
arrow
from
the
bow
we
saw
there
countless
throngs
together
swarm
in
bright
array
and
glowing
martial
pomp
until
they
formed
in
serried
rank
one
firm
trilateral
host
that
like
a
triangle
thrust
out
its
edges
sharp
upon
the
eye
we
saw
a
solid
mass
like
one
dense
light
polished
even
like
to
diamond
and
a
advance
by
god
more
than
by
spirit
understood
the
towered
in
the
army
heart
before
god
banner
with
the
glow
of
lurid
lightnings
in
his
lifted
hand
who
courage
would
would
victory
and
triumph
should
first
have
care
to
make
sure
of
and
then
to
gain
the
heart
rafael
but
where
the
host
accursed
that
us
would
storm
uriel
it
came
into
the
field
of
daring
full
with
all
its
primal
faith
obedience
honor
and
oath
and
what
besides

in
this
base
and
presumptuous
attempt
god
despite
our
prayers
it
swiftly
waxed
and
pointed
like
a
crescent
moon
its
ends
it
sharpened
both
its
points
and
these
even
like
two
horns
closed
in
upon
us
as
amid
the
zodiac
the
bull
doth
threaten
with
his
golden
horns
the
other
animals
celestial
and
the
monsters
that
revolve
around
upon
the
right
horn
there
advanced
prince
belzebub
whose
purpose
was
to
clip
our
spreading
wings
and
also
to
keep
guard
the
left
horn
to
prince
belial
was
assigned
thus
both
stood
there
in
shining
panoply
vying
in
splendors
grand
the
stadtholder
now
god
the
centre
held
of
this
array
that
he
might
guard
the
key
the
point
strategic
of
the
legions
there
the
lofty
standard
from
whose
the
day
did
seem
to
stream
apollion
behind
him
bore
as
bravely
as
he

his
full
glory
seated
high
to

alas
what
dares
what
dares
the
great
archangel
attempt
oh
if
i
only
could
in
time
have
brought
him
to
desist
however
now
describe
to
me
the
aspect
of
their
march
and
with
what
show
the
prince
his
legions
led
uriel
surrounded
by
his
staff
and
retinue
in
green
he
wickedly
impelled
by
hate
irreconcilable
in
golden
mail
that
brightly
shone
upon
his
martial
vest
of
glowing
purple
mounted
then
his
car
whose
golden
wheels
with
rubies
were
emblazed
the
lion
and
the
dragon
fell
prepared
for
speedy
flight
with
backs
sown
full
of
stars
and
to
the
chariot
joined
by
pearly
traces
panted
for
strife
and
for
destruction
flamed
within
his
hand
a
he
bore
and
from
his
left
arm
hung
a
glimmering
shield
wherein
his
was
artfully
embossed
thus
stood
he
poised
to
venture
all
rafael
o
lucifer
thou
shalt
this
pride
repent
thou
phoenix
god
worshippers
on
high
how
grand
thou
dost
appear
amid
thy
legions
with
helm
head
neck
and
shoulders
eminent
how
gloriously
thine
armor
thee
becomes
as
if
by
nature
fitted
to
thy
form
oh
chief
of
spirits
no
farther
go
turn
back
uriel
confronted
thus
they
stood
embattled
troop
by
troop
each
in
his
air
and
station
placed
all
ranked
by
files
their
respective
chiefs
both
sides
arrayed
with
fairest
pomp
to
view
when
furious
drum
and
clarion
trumpet
sound
their
medley
resonance
nerves
every
arm
and
sharpens
every
sword
and
mounts
on
high
into
the
firmament
of
the
holy
light
supreme
a
din
whereat
a
pregnant
cloud
of
darts
doth
burst
with
pealing
of
fiery
hail
a
storm
and
tempest
fierce
that
makes
afraid
the
very
heaven
and
shakes
the
pillars
of
its
palaces
the
stars
and
spheres
perplexed
from
their
appointed
paths
and
orbits
err
or
on
their
circled
watch
bewildered
stand
not
knowing
where
to
turn
or
east
or
west
or
upwards
or
below
all
that
is
seen
is
lightning
flash
and
flame
all
that
is
heard
is
thunder
what
remains
in
its
primeval
place
that
which
was
once
the
highest
now
becomes
the
thing
most
low
the
squadrons
when
the
shock
of
their
artillery
first
volleyed
roar
has
died
away
now
struggle
hand
to
hand
with
halberd
sabre
dagger
club
and
spear
all
stab
and
slash
that
can
all
formed
by
nature
for
fell
destruction
and
for
greedy
spoil
now
haste
to
strike
the
violating
blow
all
thoughts
of
kin
and
brotherhood
have
ceased
nor
knoweth
any
one
his
fellow
more
above
are
whirling
like
a
cloud
of
dust
proud
crests
of
pearl
with
curlèd
locks
of
hair
and
plumes
and
wings
refulgent
with
a
gleam
drawn
from
the
singeing
lightning
glow
behold
in
rich
confusion
mingled
blue
turquoise
with
gold
and
diamond
necklaces
of
pearl
and
all
that
can
adorn
the
hair
or
head
wings
lopped
in
twain
and
broken
arrows
whirl
athwart
the
sky
a
horrid
rises
from
out
the
cohorts
clad
in
green
their
regiments
in
danger
are
compelled
by
our
hot
onset
to
retreat
three
times
the
maddened
lucifer
the
fight
renews
and
proudly
stays
his
faltering
followers
even
as
a
rock
beats
back
the
ocean
surge
that
wave
on
wave
with
foaming
rage
assails
in
vain
attempt
rafael
indeed
is
something
this
to
fight
armed
by
despair
uriel
then
straightway
caused
the
valiant
michael
all
the
trumps
to
sound
glory
to
god
his
legions
thus
made
bold
by
this
their
watchword
and
by
his
command
begin
by
circling
wheels
to
soar
aloft
to
gain
the
of
their
battling
foe
who
also
rises
but
with
heavier
sail
and
finally
to
leeward
slowly
drifts
as
if
one
heavenward
a
falcon
saw
mounting
with
pinions
bold
into
the
sky
ere
that
the
drowsing
herons
are
aware
who
in
a
wood
hard
by
a
pleasant
mead
tremble
with
fright
when
from
their
lofty
nest
they
see
their
dreaded
foe
the
heron
cries
and
fearful
of
the
falcon
direful
claw
awaits
him
on
his
beak
thus
to
impale
his
enemy
soft
breast
from
there
beneath
when
swoops
the
falcon
with
unerring
wings
upon
his
prey
rafael
o
lucifer
for
thee
what
remedy
it
seems
most
terrible
now
art
thou
in
the
open
field
where
port
nor
wall
defend
a
horrid
whirlwind
soon
shall
suddenly
swoop
down
and
bury
thee
deep
in
some
gulf
and
bottomless
abyss
uriel
what
fair
perspective
it
was
thus
to
view
a
hemisphere
or
crescent
moon
beneath
and
up
above
a
point
trilateral
to
see
the
legions
that
upon
the
word
of
their
commanding
chiefs
close
in
their
ranks
or
them
deploy
in
their
battalions
stand
as
firm
as
walls
of
iron
as
if
they
with
all
their
ordnance
dumb
artillery
and
martial
engines
there
in
equipoise
were
placed
the
balanced
air
they
hang
suspended
like
a
silent
cloud
a
cloud
whereon
the
sun
doth
pour
his
beams
and
which
he
paints
with
shade
and
varied
hue
and
airy
rainbows
so
then
steeply
flown
aloft
the
bold
celestial
eagle
sees
god
foe
the
hawk
circling
his
flight
beneath
he
strikes
his
wings
together
valiantly
but
brooks
awhile
the
hawk
wild
wheeling
there
and
vain
defiance
while
he
flames
ere
long
to
swoop
upon
his
feathered
back
and
pluck
his
glossy
plumes
when
in
the
aery
vast
with
curvèd
beak
and
talons
he
shall
seize
his
prey
or
drive
it
with
the
wind
behind
far
from
his
eyes
thus
they
precipitate
themselves
and
stream
down
from
their
place
on
high
even
like
some
inland
lake
or
waterfall
in
some
far
northern
wild
that
from
the
cliffs
dashes
with
thundering
resonance
that
frights
the
beasts
and
monsters
in
dells
where
from
the
precipice
rocks
loosened
fall
with
massive
torrents
and
uprooted
trees
in
countless
numbers
that
in
their
fierce
plunge
crush
and
destroy
all
that
the
violence
of
stream
and
stone
and
wood
can
not
withstand
the
point
of
the
advancing
column
strikes
the
crescent
centre
with
assault
most
fell
of
brimstone
red
and
blue
and
flames
with
stroke
on
stroke
and
thunderbolts
a
piercing
cry
ascends
their
army
heart
endangered
now
begins
by
slow
degrees
to
fail
support
of
the
accursèd
one
the
bow
beneath
the
strain
begins
to
crack
and
break
for
the
ends
together
curve
so
that
they
who
the
centre
hold
must
yield
before
that
onset
fierce
and
flee
if
soon
deliverance
be
not
brought
from
their
distress
prince
lucifer
here
and
there
approaches
at
this
cry
and
fearlessly
himself
exposes
on
his
car
to
show
his
valor
in
this
crisis
dire
this
gives
new
heart
unto
the
faltering
ones
then
from
the
foaming
bit
of
his
now
furious
team
he
wards
the
feilest
blows
and
fiercest
strokes
the
lion
and
the
dragon
blue
enraged
leap
forward
at
his
word
with
fearful
strides
one
bellows
bites
and
rends
while
poison
shoots
out
from
the
other
forkèd
tongue
who
thus
a
pest
provokes
and
raving
fills
the
air
with
smoke
blown
from
his
nostrils
far
and
wide
rafael
now
will
the
burning
strike
him
from
on
high
uriel
he
waves
his
aloft
to
fell
god
banner
that
descending
darts
the
beams
and
fairer
radiance
of
god
name
into
his
glowing
face
oh
think
what
envy
then
him
filled
to
see
this
portent
on
our
side
with
in
hand
now
here
now
there
he
parries
every
stroke
or
breaks
their
force
upon
his
shield
till
michael
comes
before
him
clad
in
glittering
armor
like
a
god
amid
a
ring
of
suns
cease
lucifer
give
god
the
victory
lay
down
your
arms
and
standard
yield
to
god
come
lead
away
this
wicked
crew
this
impious
horde
or
else
beware
thy
head
thus
shouts
he
from
on
high
the
grand
foe
of
god
name
unmoved
and
more
defiant
at
these
words
renews
the
fight
with
haste
precipitate
and
thrice
with
strives
to
cleave
the
diamond
shield
where
glowed
god
holy
name
but
who
provokes
the
deity
shall
feel
his
wrath
the
axe
the
holy
diamond
strikes
but
lo
rebounds
and
shivers
into
fragments
then
aloft
his
right
hand
michael
lifts
and
through
the
helm
and
head
of
that
rebellious
one
he
smites
helped
by
the
great
omnipotent
his
lightnings
cleaving
unto
his
eyes
with
violence
so
great
that
he
falls
backward
and
is
hurled
down
from
his
chariot
that
forthwith
follows
him
whirling
round
and
round
in
its
descent
thus
lion
dragon
driver
all
plunge
down
the
standard
of
the
star
doth
cease
to
shine
when
feels
apollion
my
flaming
sword
whereon
his
banner
straightway
he
doth
leave
as
plunder
in
my
hands
while
in
fierce
swarms
tumultuous
their
warring
myriads
attempt
in
vain
to
stay
the
falling
chief
of
all
the
hosts
infernal
and
to
save
him
from
this
fate
and
great
calamity
here
fights
prince
belzebub
and
there
opposed
stands
belial
thus
their
squadrons
are
confused
and
with
the
stadtholder
important
fall
the
crescent
bow
soon
into
shivers
breaks
then
comes
apollion
into
the
field
with
all
the
monsters
from
the
firmament
the
giant
orion
shrieks
until
the
sound
the
very
air
makes
faint
then
with
his
club
he
strives
to
crush
the
head
of
our
assault
that
heedless
of
orion
or
his
club
moves
grandly
on
the
northern
bears
rear
back
upon
their
haunches
that
their
brutish
strength
may
blindly
us
oppose
the
hydra

with
fifty
throats
that
vomit
poison
forth
i
view
a
gallery
of
all
happening
in
the
fray
as
far
as

thus
lion
dragon
driver
all
plunge
down
rafael
praise
be
to
god
upon
your
knees
fall
down
and
worship
him
o
lucifer
ah
where
now
is
that
fickle
confidence
in
what
strange
shape
shall
i
alas
behold
thee
soon
where
now
are
thy
proud
splendors
that
all
other
pomp
so
easily
outshone
uriel
even
as
bright
day
to
gloomy
night
is
changed
the
sun
forgets
his
golden
glow
so
in
his
downward
fall
his
beauty
turned
to
something
monstrous
and
most
horrible
into
a
brutish
snout
his
face
that
shone
so
glorious
his
teeth
into
large
fangs
sharpened
for
gnawing
steel
his
hands
and
feet
into
four
various
claws
into
a
hide
of
black
that
shining
skin
of
pearl
while
from
his
bristled
back
two
dragon
wings
did
sprout
alas
the
proud
archangel
whom
but
now
all
angels
honored
here
hath
changed
his
shape
into
a
hideous
medley
of
seven
beasts
as
outwardly
appears
a
lion
proud
a
greedy
gluttonous
swine
a
slothful
ass
a
fierce
rhinoceros
with
rage
inflamed
an
ape
in
every
part
obscene
and
vile
by
nature
lewd
and
most
lascivious
a
dragon
full
of
envy
and
a
wolf
of
sordid
avarice
his
beauteous
form
is
now
a
monster
execrable
by
god
and
spirit
and
man
to
be
cursed
that
beast
doth
shrink
to
view
its
own
deformity
and
veils
with
darkling
mists
its
gorgon
face
rafael
thus
shall
ambition
learn
how
vain
to
tilt
for
god
own
crown
where
stayed
apollion
uriel
he
saw
his
tide
ebb
when
his
star
declined
and
fled
so
fled
they
all
then
from
above
the
celestial
ordnance
pours
forth
shot
on
shot
with
lightning
flash
and
rolling
thunders
loud
causing
the
monsters
that
into
the
light
have
crawled
to
swell
the
rout
and
pleased
are
all
with
god
array
to
aid

such
pursuit
o
what
a
whirl
of
storms
in
one
resolved

a
noisy
tumult
rises
round

sweep
by
our

blessed

crush

what
cries

now
burst
forth
everywhere

from
the
fleeing
hordes
one
hears
amid
this
wild
confusion

this
change
of
form
in
limbs

their
roars

birth
in
his
ascent
ere
that
his
sinews
gain
their
promised
strength
and
ere
he
multiply
is
my
design
both
adam
and
his
seed
now
to
corrupt
i
know
how
through
transgression
of
the
law
him
first
enjoined
to
stain
him
with
a
blot
indelible
so
that
he
with
his
seed
in
soul
and
body
poisoned
never
shall
usurp
the
throne
from
which
ourselves
were
thrust
though
it
may
be
that
some
shall
yet
ascend
on
high
a
number
small
and
slight
and
these
alone
through
thousand
deaths
and
suffering
and
labor
shall
attain
the
state
and
crown
to
us
denied
lo
miseries
forthwith
shall
follow
aft
in
adam
wake
and
spread
from
age
to
age
throughout
the
whole
wide
world
even
nature
shall
attainted
by
this
blow
almost
decay
and
wish
again
to
turn
to
chaos
and
its
primal
nothingness
i
see
mankind
in
god
own
image
made
from
god
similitude
debased
estranged
and
tarnished
even
in
will
and
memory
and
understanding
while
the
holy
light
within
created
is
obscured
and
dimmed
yea
all
yet
in
their
mother
anxious
womb
that
wait
with
sorrow
for
their
natal
hour
i
now
forsooth
behold
a
helpless
prey
to
death
relentless
jaws
i
shall
exalt
my
tyranny
with
pride
while
you
my
sons
i
then
shall
see
adored
as
deities
on
altars
and
in
fanes
innumerable
that
tower
to
heaven
where
burns
the
sacrificial
victim
the
smoke
of
censers
and
the
dazzling
sheen
of
gold
in
praise
most
reverential
i
see
hosts
of
men
whose
multitudes
are
even
beyond
the
power
of
tongue
to
name
yea
all
that
spring
from
adam
loins
for
all
eternity
accursed
by
their
deeds
abominable
done
in
defiance
of
god
name
so
dear
to
him
the
cost
of
triumph
my
crown
michael
accursèd
one
even
yet
to
be
so
bold
in
thy
defiance
thy
god
ere
long
thou
shalt
from
us
this
blasphemy
unlearn
gabriel
even
thus
spake
lucifer
and
then
he
sent
prince
belial
down
that
he
forthwith
might
cause
mankind
to
fall
who
took
upon
himself
the
form
of
that
most
cunning
of
all
beasts
the
serpent
type
of
wickedness
itself
that
he
might
with
a
gloss
of
words
adorn
his
luring
snares
which
then
those
creatures
pure
in
guileless
innocence
even
thus
received
as
swinging
from
the
tempting
bough
of
knowledge
that
lone
forbidden
tree
he
hung
aloft
hath
god
upon
the
pain
of
death
with
such
severity
and
at
so
high
a
price
deprived
you
of
the
freedom
of
this
fruit
the
taste
of
even
the
choicest
tree
of
all
nay
eve
thou
simple
dove
indeed
thou
dost
mistake
but
once
behold
this
apple
pray
aye
see
how
glows
this
radiant
fruit
with
gold
and
crimson
mingled
an
alluring
feast
yea
daughter
nearer
draw
no
venom
lurks
up
in
this
immortal
leaf
how
tempts
this
fruit
yea
pluck
yea
freely
pluck
i
promise
thee
all
light
and
knowledge
come
why
shouldst
thou
shrink
for
fear
of
sin
aye
taste
and
thus
become
equal
to
god
himself
in
cognizance
honor
and
wisdom
truth
and
majesty
even
though
he
much
may
wish
thee
to
deny
thus
must
distinctions
be
discerned
in
things
their
nature
entities
and
qualities
forthwith
begins
the
heart
of
the
fair
bride
to
burn
and
to
enkindle
till
she
flames
to
see
the
praised
fruit
which
first
allures
the
eye
the
eye
the
mouth
that
sighs
to
taste
desire
doth
urge
the
hand
all
quivering
to
pluck
and
thus
she
plucks
and
tastes
and
eats
oh
how
this
shall
afflict
her
progeny
with
adam
and
as
soon
as
then
their
eyes
are
opened
and
they
see
their
nakedness
they
deck
themselves
with
leaves
with
leaves
of
fig
their
shame
disgrace
and
taint
original
and
in
the
trees
and
shadows
hide
themselves
but
hide
in
vain
from
the
eye
then
gradually
the
sky
grows
black
they
see
the
rainbow
as
a
warning
messenger
and
portent
of
god
plagues
stretched
the
heavens
that
weep
in
mourning
clad
nor
wringing
hands
nor
sad
lament
nor

the

alas
the
lightnings
gleam
with
flash
on

shaking
thunders
roll
there
peal
on
peal
and
naught
is
heard
but
sighs
and
naught
is
seen
but
fright
and
gloom
they
even
their
shadows
flee
but
can
that
dread
worm
the
sting
of
conscience
thus
with
knees
that
knock
together
step
by
step
they
stumble
on
their
faces
ghastly
pale
and
eyes
with
tears
blind
to
the
light
how
spiritless
they
who
but
now
their
heads
so
proudly
held
the
sound
of
rustling
leaf
or
whispering
brook
the
faintest
noise
doth
them
confound
the
while
a
pregnant
cloud
descends
that
bursts
and
bears
by
slow
degrees
a
light
and
radiant
glow
wherein
the
great
supreme
appears
in
shape
impressive
thundering
with
his
voice
that
fells
them
to

feel
its

mary

i
was
reading
your
translation
of
vondel
last
year
and
i
was
very
much
struck
with
the
resemblance
to
milton
in
form
and
spirit
the
conception
of
the
mental
attitude
of
the
fallen
angels
is
one
which
is
certainly
very
interesting
from
a
psychological
as
well
as
a
literary
point
of
a
lawrence
lowell
the
lucifer
has
greatly
interested
me
as
a
revelation
of
one
at
least
of
the
main
sources
from
which
milton
gained
his
ideas
your
preliminary
work
to
me
seems
to
be
admirable
and
you
have
certainly
rendered
a
real
service
both
to
history
and
literature

i
confess
it
it
was
long

since
i
read
that
great

and
your

afforded
me
all
the
pleasure
of
an
original
as
for
your
splendid
chapter
and
times
of
vondel
and
your
thorough
and
searching
lucifer
interpretation
they
can
not
fail
to
awaken
the
keenest
interest

tell
you
with
what
intense
interest

pleasure
i
have
followed
your
astonishing
success
i
say
astonishing
because
i
wonder
how
long
it
is
since
any
one
has
been
able
to
stir
up
such
keen
and
general
interest
over
a
classic
written
long
ago
and
in
a
foreign
tongue
how
long
ago
has
it
been
since
any
classic
was
so
much
talked
of
when
pray
has
a
young
man
made
such
a
contribution
to
english
letters
and
so
interested
thinking
and
scholarly
people

cather
it
has
become
a
matter
of

tradition

and
out
of
it
that
the
choral

of
is
the
great
masterpiece
of
dutch
literature
an
era
of
translation
was
sure
to
set
in
and
it
is
a
matter
of
significance
that
its
herald
has
even
now
appeared
the
translation
into
english
of
vondel
is
not
only
in
and
for
itself
an
event
of
more
than
ordinary
importance
in
literary
history
but
it
can
not
fail
to
waken
among
us
a
curiosity
as
to
what
else
of
supreme
value
may
be
contained
in
dutch
literature

heartily
rejoice
that

has
been
translated
into

by
an
american
for
americans
were
this
translation
an
inferior
one
or
were
it
only
mediocre
we
should
have
no
reason
to
be
glad
but
in
this
case
it
is
otherwise
although
no
translation
can
entirely
compensate
for
the
lack
of
the
original
it
is
however
possible
for
the
original
to
be
followed
very
closely
this
is
well
shown
by
this
rendering
which
to
a
high
degree
possesses
the
merit
of
accuracy
while
at
the
same
time
the
spirit
and
the
character
of
tragedy
are
felt
understood
and
interpreted
in
a
remarkable
manner
whoever
is
in
a
position
by
the
comparison
of
the
translation
with
the
original
to
form
an
individual
opinion
of

superb
work

probably
be
convinced

not

most

you
have
even
most

succeeded
in

appreciate
him
from
your
translation
it
is
also
very
plain
from
the
essays
preceding
the
translation
that
you
have
made
a
most
thorough
and
comprehensive
study
of

of
his
poetry
in
connection
with
the
entire

though
having
myself
read

even
written
in

as
well
as

so
much
concerning

i
was
often
so
impressed

criticisms

observations
in

that
i
felt
impelled

revise

complete

the

has
produced

so

might
be
taken
for
an

his

you
kindly
address
leonard
van
noppen
queen
wilhelmina
lecturer
columbia
university
van
noppen
will
be
glad
at
any
time
to
introduce
you
to
this
subject
and
to
lecture
on
such
phases
of
it
as
you
may
deem
the
most
interesting
we
invite
your
students
to
our
universities
here
is
a
field
which
will
enrich
scholarship
with
many
discoveries
the
selection
of
the
hague
as
the
capital
of
peace
has
given
holland
a
new
international
importance
your
universities
have
established
chairs
in
icelandic
chinese
and
russian
subjects
whose
importance
and
value
are
incalculably
less
than
that
of
dutch
is
it
not
time
that
a
beginning
be
made
in
this
direction
not
even
the
study
of
the
spanish
the
italian
and
the
french
is
so
fertile
of
results
as
that
of
the
civilization
of
the
netherlands
which
as
the
mother
of
the
teutonic
renaissance
influenced
the
civilization
of
the
world
so
largely
butler
will
upon
application
be
glad
to
give
van
noppen
leave
of
absence
to
lecture
at
your
university
van
noppen
has
given
courses
of
lectures
on
this
subject
at
the
lowell
institute
brooklyn
institute
johns
hopkins
columbia
michigan
wisconsin
minnesota
cincinnati
and
many
other
colleges
and
universities
we
add
the
following
notice
of
his
lecture
at
davidson
college
davidson
april
it
is
altogether
too
seldom
that
our
southern
colleges
certainly
it
is
true
of
davidson
are
privileged
to
have
with
them
a
lecturer
of
the
type
seen
in
professor
leonard
charles
van
noppen
of
the
queen
wilhelmina
chair
of
dutch
literature
in
columbia
university
who
spoke
last
evening
in
shearer
hall
and
who
speaks
again
this
evening
and
doctor
van
noppen
was
introduced
by
professor
thomas
lingle
who
in
a
brief
speech
told
of
the
lecturers
right
by
virtue
of
birth
and
training
to
speak
on
the
topic
selected
and
for
a
few
minutes
in
an
instructive
way
pointed
out
what
holland
had
contributed
to
western
civilization
and
particularly
to
american
life
and
history
an
introduction
so
full
of
facts
marked
with
such
accurate
historical
perspective
that
the
columbia
lecturer
in
making
acknowledgment
said
he
felt
inclined
to
take
his
seat
and
let
doctor
lingle
continue
so
familiar
did
he
seem
with
the
subject
he
himself
was
to
present
to
say
that
doctor
van
noppen
lecture
was
popular
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
would
do
it
great
injustice
it
was
too
comprehensive
in
its
reach
and
strong
in
its
grasp
too
scholarly
too
suggestive
of
research
and
prolonged
investigation
and
study
too
elaborate
in
phrase
and
too
masterful
in
its
discriminating
use
of
choice
english
and
ornate
diction
for
any
one
to
call
it
popular
its
purpose
and
its
value
is
not
of
this
order
rather
after
listening
to
such
a
paper
the
scholar
is
glad
that
it
is
doubtless
to
appear
in
permanent
or
book
form
where
he
can
study
it
at
leisure
to
the
college
student
it
serves
as
a
stimulus
an
inspiration
an
ideal
to
show
him
that
in
his
daily
routine
of
class
room
work
he
is
only
laying
a
foundation
on
which
to
build
and
with
which
he
may
begin
the
higher
intellectual
life
may
start
out
for
himself
to
read
to
investigate
and
in
time
reduce
to
consistent
and
articulated
form
the
results
of
his
own
weeks
and
months
not
to
say
years
of
patient
toil
in
the
great
libraries
in
a
very
strict
sense
doctor
van
noppen
first
lecture
was
scholarly
and
showed
clearly
that
it
breathes
a
university
atmosphere
and
is
intended
primarily
and
ultimately
for
the
lecture
hall
of
the
johns
hopkins
university
where
he
is
soon
to
deliver
the
series
he
is
just
now
returning
from
a
lecture
tour
in
the
west
beginning
with
a
clever
characterization
of
the
people
of
holland
as
a
practical
one
first
reclaiming
from
the
sea
a
land
to
live
on
and
then
anchoring
it
to
the
continent
in
rapid
review
he
showed
what
a
wonderful
contribution
this
little
country
less
than
maryland
and
small
in
everything
but
in
history
has
made
to
modern
christian
civilization
washed
out
of
the
soil
of
germany
on
toward
the
sea
and
no
wonder
that
germany
looks
with
envious
eyes
upon
it
it
is
the
richest
country
imaginable
it
has
a
per
capita
wealth
of
as
against
america
in
proportion
to
population
it
has
done
more
for
civilization
than
any
other
nation
not
even
greece
excepted
then
followed
in
rapid
review
the
facts
of
history
in
substantiation
of
the
claim
conspicuous
in
the
claims
and
seemingly
substantiated
was
in
the
influence
of
holland
in
spreading
abroad
notably
in
america
the
doctrines
of
the
equality
of
all
men
separation
of
church
and
state
religious
freedom
freedom
of
the
press
local
fine
was
the
description
of
philip
of
spain
of
william
the
silent
interesting
was
the
portrayal
of
the
work
of
the
chamber
of
eglantine
of
amsterdam
of
the
men
of
letters
of
leiden
and
the
intellectual
forces
leading
up
to
and
resulting
in
the
great
university
in
leiden
most
striking
of
all
was
his
brilliant
description
of
the
life
and
work
of
the
great
dutch
poet
vondel
and
the
story
of
how
milton
the
greatest
of
english
epic
poets
has
been
content
to
follow
imitate
and
copy
from
vondel
in
his
lucifer
where
vondel
has
shown
himself
the
great
dramatist
the
baltimore
sun
writes
of
his
lecture
at
johns
hopkins
very
frequently
since
the
day
when
geoffrey
chaucer
fashioned
his
immortal
tales
upon
bocaccio
english
poets
have
been
subject
to
the
impeachment
of
having
borrowed
usually
without
proper
acknowledgment
from
foreign
sources
borrowed
material
plot
episodes
characters
and
sometimes
language
embodied
in
whole
phrases
and
sentences
the
elizabethan
age
though
it
was
in
creative
literary
excellence
has
not
escaped
the
challenge
of
its
originality
french
and
italian
influences
and
writers
exercised
a
strongly
formative
power
upon
drayton
sidney
spenser
and
others
of
the
elect
and
even
the
great
bard
of
stratford
did
not
scruple
at
transmuting
the
clay
of
less
gifted
molders
into
the
gold
of
his
superb
coinage
but
it
has
not
been
generally
recognized
that
milton
was
such
an
appropriator
accordingly
van
noppen
lecture
showing
that
the
great
puritan
poet
was
indebted
to
the
of
vondel
the
dutch
author
for
the
theme
the
treatment
the
description
and
even
some
of
the
finest
passages
in
lost
is
a
surprise
yet
van
noppen
makes
out
a
very
strong
case
the
appearance
of
a
short
time
before
milton
continental
tour
which
was
cut
short
by
the
breaking
out
of
the
great
civil
war
in
england
the
strong
likelihood
that
milton
had
heard
of
vondel
and
his
work
through
roger
williams
whose
sojourn
in
europe
had
made
him
acquainted
with
and
who
had
instructed
milton
in
modern
languages
milton
association
in
paris
with
hugo
grotius
one
of
the
most
eminent
scholars
of
his
time
a
countryman
and
an
enthusiastic
admirer
of
vondel
all
combine
into
a
strong
chain
of
circumstantial
evidence
which
reinforced
by
the
undeniable
similarity
and
the
many
parallel
passages
in
the
two
great
works
make
a
conclusion
which
is
almost
imperative
but
the
conceding
of
milton
debt
to
vondel
does
not
cancel
our
debt
to
milton
whose
sublime
epic
has
given
pleasure
and
comfort
to
scores
of
readers
to
whom
vondel
drama
has
been
a
sealed
volume
neither
does
it
release
our
obligation
to
unto
caesar
the
things
that
are
cæsar
furthermore
we
hope
that
you
will
consider
the
establishment
of
a
chair
in
dutch
literature
or
history
and
that
you
in
anticipation
of
this
foundation
will
from
time
to
time
send
us
such
students
as
desire
to
make
this
subject
their
specialty
hoping
that
you
after
a
consideration
of
this
matter
will
with
us
