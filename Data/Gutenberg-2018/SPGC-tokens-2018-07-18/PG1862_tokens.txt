tartarin
of
tarascon
by
alphonse
daudet
episode
the
first
in
tarascon
i
the
garden
round
the
giant
trees
my
first
visit
to
tartarin
of
tarascon
has
remained
a
date
in
my
life
although
quite
ten
or
a
dozen
years
ago
i
remember
it
better
than
yesterday
at
that
time
the
intrepid
tartarin
lived
in
the
third
house
on
the
left
as
the
town
begins
on
the
avignon
road
a
pretty
little
villa
in
the
local
style
with
a
front
garden
and
a
balcony
behind
the
walls
glaringly
white
and
the
venetians
very
green
and
always
about
the
doorsteps
a
brood
of
little
savoyard
playing
hopscotch
or
dozing
in
the
broad
sunshine
with
their
heads
pillowed
on
their
boxes
outwardly
the
dwelling
had
no
remarkable
features
and
none
would
ever
believe
it
the
abode
of
a
hero
but
when
you
stepped
inside
ye
gods
and
little
fishes
what
a
change
from
turret
to
i
mean
from
cellar
to
garret
the
whole
building
wore
a
heroic
front
even
so
the
garden
o
that
garden
of
tartarin
s
there
s
not
its
match
in
europe
not
a
native
tree
was
there
not
one
flower
of
france
nothing
hut
exotic
plants
gourds
cocoa
and
cacao
mangoes
bananas
palms
a
baobab
nopals
cacti
barbary
figs
well
you
would
believe
yourself
in
the
very
midst
of
central
africa
ten
thousand
leagues
away
it
is
but
fair
to
say
that
these
were
none
of
full
growth
indeed
the
were
no
bigger
than
beet
root
and
the
baobab
arbos
gigantea
giant
tree
you
know
was
easily
enough
circumscribed
by
a
but
notwithstanding
this
it
was
rather
a
sensation
for
tarascon
and
the
townsfolk
who
were
admitted
on
sundays
to
the
honour
of
contemplating
tartarin
s
baobab
went
home
chokeful
of
admiration
try
to
conceive
my
own
emotion
which
i
was
bound
to
feel
on
that
day
of
days
when
i
crossed
through
this
marvellous
garden
and
that
was
capped
when
i
was
ushered
into
the
hero
s
sanctum
his
study
one
of
the
lions
i
should
say
lions
dens
of
the
town
was
at
the
end
of
the
garden
its
glass
door
opening
right
on
to
the
baobab
you
are
to
picture
a
capacious
apartment
adorned
with
firearms
and
steel
blades
from
top
to
bottom
all
the
weapons
of
all
the
countries
in
the
wide
world
carbines
rifles
blunderbusses
corsican
catalan
and
dagger
knives
malay
kreeses
revolvers
with
carib
and
flint
arrows
hottentot
clubs
mexican
lassoes
now
can
you
expect
me
to
name
the
rest
upon
the
whole
fell
a
fierce
sunlight
which
made
the
blades
and
the
brass
of
the
muskets
gleam
as
if
all
the
more
to
set
your
flesh
creeping
still
the
beholder
was
soothed
a
little
by
the
tame
air
of
order
and
tidiness
reigning
over
the
arsenal
everything
was
in
place
brushed
dusted
labelled
as
in
a
museum
from
point
to
point
the
eye
descried
some
obliging
little
card
reading
i
poisoned
arrows
i
i
do
not
touch
i
or
i
loaded
i
i
take
care
please
i
if
it
had
not
been
for
these
cautions
i
never
should
have
dared
venture
in
in
the
middle
of
the
room
was
an
occasional
table
on
which
stood
a
decanter
of
rum
a
siphon
of
a
turkish
captain
cook
s
voyages
the
indian
tales
of
fenimore
cooper
and
gustave
aimard
stories
of
hunting
the
bear
eagle
elephant
and
so
on
lastly
beside
the
table
sat
a
man
of
between
forty
and
short
stout
ruddy
with
flaming
eyes
and
a
strong
stubbly
beard
he
wore
flannel
tights
and
was
in
his
shirt
sleeves
one
hand
held
a
book
and
the
other
brandished
a
very
large
pipe
with
an
iron
whilst
reading
heaven
only
knows
what
startling
adventure
of
he
pouted
out
his
lower
lip
in
a
terrifying
way
which
gave
the
honest
phiz
of
the
man
living
placidly
on
his
means
the
same
impression
of
kindly
ferocity
which
abounded
throughout
the
house
this
man
was
tartarin
himself
the
tartarin
of
tarascon
the
great
dreadnought
incomparable
tartarin
of
tarascon
ii
a
general
glance
bestowed
upon
the
good
town
of
tarascon
and
a
particular
one
on
the
at
the
time
i
am
telling
of
tartarin
of
tarascon
had
not
become
the
tartarin
the
great
one
so
popular
in
the
whole
south
of
france
but
yet
he
was
even
then
the
cock
of
the
walk
at
tarascon
let
us
show
whence
arose
this
sovereignty
in
the
first
place
you
must
know
that
everybody
is
shooting
mad
in
these
parts
from
the
greatest
to
the
least
the
chase
is
the
local
craze
and
so
it
has
ever
been
since
the
mythological
times
when
the
tarasque
as
the
county
dragon
was
called
flourished
himself
and
his
tail
in
the
town
marshes
and
entertained
shooting
parties
got
up
against
him
so
you
see
the
passion
has
lasted
a
goodish
bit
it
follows
that
every
sunday
morning
tarascon
flies
to
arms
lets
loose
the
dogs
of
the
hunt
and
rushes
out
of
its
walls
with
slung
and
on
the
shoulder
together
with
a
of
hounds
cracking
of
whips
and
blowing
of
whistles
and
it
s
splendid
to
see
unfortunately
there
s
a
lack
of
game
an
absolute
dearth
stupid
as
the
brute
creation
is
you
can
readily
understand
that
in
time
it
learnt
some
distrust
for
five
leagues
around
about
tarascon
forms
lairs
and
burrows
are
empty
and
abandoned
you
ll
not
find
a
single
quail
or
blackbird
one
little
leveret
or
the
tiniest
tit
and
yet
the
pretty
hillocks
are
mightily
tempting
sweet
smelling
as
they
are
of
myrtle
lavender
and
rosemary
and
the
fine
muscatels
plumped
out
with
sweetness
even
unto
bursting
as
they
spread
along
the
banks
of
the
rhone
are
deucedly
tempting
too
true
true
but
tarascon
lies
behind
all
this
and
tarascon
is
down
in
the
black
books
of
the
world
of
fur
and
feather
the
very
birds
of
passage
have
ticked
it
off
on
their
and
when
the
wild
ducks
coming
down
towards
the
camargue
in
long
triangles
spy
the
town
steeples
from
afar
the
outermost
flyers
squawk
out
loudly
look
out
there
s
tarascon
give
tarascon
the
duckies
and
the
flocks
take
a
swerve
in
short
as
far
as
game
goes
there
s
not
a
specimen
left
in
the
land
save
one
old
rogue
of
a
hare
escaped
by
miracle
from
the
massacres
who
is
stubbornly
determined
to
stick
to
it
all
his
life
he
is
very
well
known
at
tarascon
and
a
name
has
been
given
him
rapid
is
what
they
call
him
it
is
known
that
he
has
his
form
on
bompard
s
grounds
which
by
the
way
has
doubled
ay
tripled
the
value
of
the
property
but
nobody
has
yet
managed
to
lay
him
low
at
present
only
two
or
three
inveterate
fellows
worry
themselves
about
him
the
rest
have
given
him
up
as
a
bad
job
and
old
rapid
has
long
ago
passed
into
the
legendary
world
although
your
tarasconer
is
very
slightly
superstitious
naturally
and
would
eat
on
toast
or
the
swallow
which
is
our
lady
s
own
bird
for
that
matter
if
he
could
find
any
but
that
won
t
do
you
will
say
inasmuch
as
game
is
so
scarce
what
can
the
sportsmen
do
every
sunday
what
can
they
do
why
goodness
gracious
they
go
out
into
the
real
country
two
or
three
leagues
from
town
they
gather
in
knots
of
five
or
six
recline
tranquilly
in
the
shade
of
some
well
old
wall
or
olive
tree
extract
from
their
a
piece
of
boiled
beef
raw
onions
a
sausage
and
anchovies
and
commence
a
next
to
endless
snack
washed
down
with
one
of
those
nice
rhone
wines
which
sets
a
toper
laughing
and
singing
after
that
when
thoroughly
braced
up
they
rise
whistle
the
dogs
to
heel
set
the
guns
on
half
cock
and
go
on
the
shoot
another
way
of
saying
that
every
man
plucks
off
his
cap
shies
it
up
with
all
his
might
and
pops
it
on
the
fly
with
no
or
shot
according
to
what
he
is
loaded
for
the
man
who
lodges
most
shot
in
his
cap
is
hailed
as
king
of
the
hunt
and
stalks
back
triumphantly
at
dusk
into
tarascon
with
his
riddled
cap
on
the
end
of
his
amid
any
quantity
of
and
it
is
needless
to
say
that
is
a
fine
business
in
the
town
there
are
even
some
hatters
who
sell
ready
shot
torn
and
perforated
for
the
bad
shots
but
the
only
buyer
known
is
the
chemist
bezuquet
this
is
dishonourable
as
a
marksman
at
caps
tartarin
of
tarascon
never
had
his
match
every
sunday
morning
out
he
would
march
in
a
new
cap
and
back
he
would
strut
every
sunday
evening
with
a
mere
thing
of
shreds
the
loft
of
baobab
villa
was
full
of
these
glorious
trophies
hence
all
tarascon
acknowledged
him
as
master
and
as
tartarin
thoroughly
understood
hunting
and
had
read
all
the
handbooks
of
all
possible
kinds
of
venery
from
to
burmese
the
sportsmen
constituted
him
their
great
cynegetical
judge
and
took
him
for
referee
and
arbitrator
in
all
their
differences
between
three
and
four
daily
at
costecalde
the
gunsmith
s
a
stout
stern
might
be
seen
in
a
green
in
the
centre
of
the
shop
crammed
with
they
all
on
foot
and
wrangling
this
was
tartarin
of
tarascon
delivering
judgement
nimrod
plus
solomon
iii
naw
naw
naw
the
general
glance
protracted
upon
the
good
town
after
the
craze
for
sporting
the
lusty
tarascon
race
cherishes
one
love
there
s
no
believing
what
a
quantity
of
ballads
is
used
up
in
that
little
region
all
the
sentimental
stuff
turning
into
sere
and
yellow
leaves
in
the
oldest
portfolios
are
to
be
found
in
full
pristine
lustre
in
tarascon
ay
the
entire
collection
every
family
has
its
own
pet
as
is
known
to
the
town
for
instance
it
is
an
established
fact
that
this
is
the
chemist
bezuquet
s
family
s
thou
art
the
fair
star
that
i
adore
the
gunmaker
costecalde
s
family
s
would
st
thou
come
to
the
land
where
the
rise
the
official
registrar
s
family
s
if
i
wore
a
coat
of
invisible
green
do
you
think
for
a
moment
i
could
be
seen
and
so
on
for
the
whole
of
tarascon
two
or
three
times
a
week
there
were
parties
where
they
were
sung
the
singularity
was
their
being
always
the
same
and
that
the
honest
tarasconers
had
never
had
an
inclination
to
change
them
during
the
long
long
time
they
had
been
harping
on
them
they
were
handed
down
from
father
to
son
in
the
families
without
anybody
improving
on
them
or
bowdlerising
them
they
were
sacred
never
did
it
occur
to
costecalde
s
mind
to
sing
the
bezuquets
or
the
bezuquets
to
try
costecalde
s
and
yet
you
may
believe
that
they
ought
to
know
by
heart
what
they
had
been
singing
for
years
but
nay
everybody
stuck
to
his
own
and
they
were
all
contented
in
as
in
tartarin
was
still
the
foremost
his
superiority
over
his
consisted
in
his
not
having
any
one
song
of
his
own
but
in
knowing
the
lot
the
whole
mind
you
but
there
s
a
but
it
was
the
devil
s
own
work
to
get
him
to
sing
them
surfeited
early
in
life
with
his
successes
our
hero
preferred
by
far
burying
himself
in
his
hunting
or
spending
the
evening
at
the
club
to
making
a
personal
exhibition
before
a
nimes
piano
between
a
pair
of
candles
these
musical
parades
seemed
beneath
him
nevertheless
at
whiles
when
there
was
a
harmonic
party
at
bezuquet
s
he
would
drop
into
the
chemist
s
shop
as
if
by
chance
and
after
a
deal
of
pressure
consent
to
do
the
grand
duo
in
robert
le
diable
with
old
madame
bezuquet
whoso
never
heard
that
never
heard
anything
for
my
part
even
if
i
lived
a
hundred
years
i
should
always
see
the
mighty
tartarin
solemnly
stepping
up
to
the
piano
setting
his
arms
akimbo
working
up
his
tragic
mien
and
beneath
the
green
reflection
from
the
in
the
window
trying
to
give
his
pleasant
visage
the
fierce
and
satanic
expression
of
robert
the
devil
hardly
would
he
fall
into
position
before
the
whole
audience
would
be
shuddering
with
the
foreboding
that
something
uncommon
was
at
hand
after
a
hush
old
madame
bezuquet
would
commence
to
her
own
accompaniment
robert
my
love
is
thine
to
thee
i
my
faith
did
plight
thou
seest
my
affright
mercy
for
thine
own
sake
and
mercy
for
mine
in
an
undertone
she
would
add
now
then
tartarin
whereupon
tartarin
of
tarascon
with
crooked
arms
clenched
fists
and
quivering
nostrils
would
roar
three
times
in
a
formidable
voice
rolling
like
a
thunderclap
in
the
bowels
of
the
instrument
no
no
no
which
like
the
thorough
southerner
he
was
he
pronounced
nasally
as
naw
naw
naw
then
would
old
madame
bezuquet
again
sing
mercy
for
thine
own
sake
and
mercy
for
mine
naw
naw
naw
bellowed
tartarin
at
his
loudest
and
there
the
gem
ended
not
long
you
see
but
it
was
so
handsomely
voiced
forth
so
clearly
gesticulated
and
so
diabolical
that
a
tremor
of
terror
overran
the
chemist
s
shop
and
the
naw
naw
naw
would
be
encored
several
times
running
upon
this
tartarin
would
sponge
his
brow
smile
on
the
ladies
wink
to
the
sterner
sex
and
withdraw
upon
his
triumph
to
go
remark
at
the
club
with
a
trifling
offhand
air
i
have
just
come
from
the
bezuquets
where
i
was
forced
to
sing
em
the
duo
from
robert
le
the
cream
of
the
joke
was
that
he
really
believed
it
iv
they
chiefly
to
the
account
of
these
diverse
talents
did
tartarin
owe
his
lofty
position
in
the
town
of
tarascon
talking
of
captivating
though
this
deuce
of
a
fellow
knew
how
to
ensnare
everybody
why
the
army
at
tarascon
was
for
tartarin
the
brave
commandant
bravida
honorary
captain
retired
in
the
military
clothing
factory
department
called
him
a
game
fellow
and
you
may
well
admit
that
the
warrior
knew
all
about
game
fellows
he
played
such
a
capital
knife
and
fork
on
game
of
all
kinds
so
was
the
legislature
on
tartarin
s
side
two
or
three
times
in
open
court
the
old
chief
judge
ladevese
had
said
in
alluding
to
him
he
is
a
character
lastly
the
masses
were
for
tartarin
he
had
become
the
swell
bruiser
the
aristocratic
pugilist
the
crack
bully
of
the
local
corinthians
for
the
tarasconers
from
his
build
bearing
style
that
aspect
of
a
guard
s
charger
which
fears
no
noise
his
reputation
as
a
hero
coming
from
nobody
knew
whence
or
for
what
and
some
scramblings
for
coppers
and
a
few
kicks
to
the
little
ragamuffins
basking
at
his
doorway
along
the
waterside
when
tartarin
came
home
from
hunting
on
sunday
evenings
with
his
cap
on
the
muzzle
of
his
gun
and
his
fustian
belted
in
tightly
the
sturdy
would
respectfully
bob
and
blinking
towards
the
huge
biceps
swelling
out
his
arms
would
mutter
among
one
another
in
admiration
now
there
s
a
powerful
chap
if
you
like
he
has
double
muscles
why
you
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
outside
of
tarascon
for
all
this
with
all
his
numberless
parts
the
popular
favour
and
the
so
precious
esteem
of
brave
commandant
bravida
in
the
army
clothing
factory
tartarin
was
not
happy
this
life
in
a
petty
town
weighed
upon
him
and
suffocated
him
the
great
man
of
tarascon
was
bored
in
tarascon
the
fact
is
for
a
heroic
temperament
like
his
a
wild
adventurous
spirit
which
dreamt
of
nothing
but
battles
races
across
the
pampas
mighty
battues
desert
sands
blizzards
and
typhoons
it
was
not
enough
to
go
out
every
sunday
to
pop
at
a
cap
and
the
rest
of
the
time
to
ladle
out
at
the
gunmaker
s
poor
dear
great
man
if
this
existence
were
only
prolonged
there
would
be
sufficient
tedium
in
it
to
kill
him
with
consumption
in
vain
did
he
surround
himself
with
baobabs
and
other
african
trees
to
widen
his
horizon
and
some
little
to
forget
his
club
and
the
in
vain
did
he
pile
weapon
upon
weapon
and
malay
kreese
upon
malay
kreese
in
vain
did
he
cram
with
romances
endeavouring
like
the
immortal
don
quixote
to
wrench
himself
by
the
vigour
of
his
fancy
out
of
the
talons
of
pitiless
reality
alas
all
that
he
did
to
appease
his
thirst
for
deeds
of
daring
only
helped
to
augment
it
the
sight
of
all
the
murderous
implements
kept
him
in
a
perpetual
stew
of
wrath
and
exaltation
his
revolvers
repeating
rifles
and
shouted
battle
battle
out
of
their
mouths
through
the
twigs
of
his
baobab
the
tempest
of
great
voyages
and
journeys
soughed
and
blew
bad
advice
to
finish
him
came
gustave
aimard
mayne
reid
and
fenimore
cooper
oh
how
many
times
did
tartarin
with
a
howl
spring
up
on
the
sultry
summer
afternoons
when
he
was
reading
alone
amidst
his
blades
points
and
edges
how
many
times
did
he
dash
down
his
book
and
rush
to
the
wall
to
unhook
a
deadly
arm
the
poor
man
forgot
he
was
at
home
in
tarascon
in
his
underclothes
and
with
a
handkerchief
round
his
head
he
would
translate
his
readings
into
action
and
goading
himself
with
his
own
voice
shout
out
whilst
swinging
a
or
tomahawk
now
only
let
em
come
them
who
were
they
tartarin
did
not
himself
any
too
clearly
understand
they
was
all
that
should
be
attacked
and
fought
with
all
that
bites
claws
scalps
whoops
and
yells
the
sioux
indians
dancing
around
the
to
which
the
unfortunate
prisoner
is
lashed
the
grizzly
of
the
rocky
mountains
who
wobbles
on
his
hind
legs
and
licks
himself
with
a
tongue
full
of
blood
the
touareg
too
in
the
desert
the
malay
pirate
the
brigand
of
the
abruzzi
in
short
they
was
warfare
travel
adventure
and
glory
but
alas
it
was
to
no
avail
that
the
fearless
tarasconer
called
for
and
defied
them
never
did
they
come
odsboddikins
what
would
they
have
come
to
do
in
tarascon
nevertheless
tartarin
always
expected
to
run
up
against
them
particularly
some
evening
in
going
to
the
club
how
tartarin
went
round
to
his
club
little
indeed
beside
tartarin
of
tarascon
arming
himself
to
go
to
his
club
at
nine
an
hour
after
the
retreat
had
sounded
on
the
bugle
was
the
templar
knight
preparing
for
a
sortie
upon
the
infidel
the
chinese
tiger
equipping
himself
for
combat
or
the
comanche
warrior
painting
up
for
going
on
the
all
hands
make
ready
for
action
as
the
s
men
say
in
his
left
hand
tartarin
took
a
in
the
right
he
carried
a
in
his
left
pocket
a
in
the
right
a
revolver
on
his
chest
betwixt
outer
and
under
garment
lay
a
malay
kreese
but
never
any
poisoned
arrows
they
are
weapons
altogether
too
unfair
before
starting
in
the
silence
and
obscurity
of
his
study
he
exercised
himself
for
a
while
warding
off
imaginary
cuts
and
thrusts
lunging
at
the
wall
and
giving
his
muscles
play
then
he
took
his
and
went
through
the
garden
leisurely
without
hurrying
mark
you
cool
and
calm
british
courage
that
is
the
true
sort
at
the
garden
end
he
opened
the
heavy
iron
door
violently
and
abruptly
so
that
it
should
slam
against
the
outer
wall
if
they
had
been
skulking
behind
it
you
may
wager
they
would
have
been
jam
unhappily
they
were
not
there
the
way
being
open
out
tartarin
would
sally
quickly
glancing
to
the
right
and
left
ere
banging
the
door
to
and
fastening
it
smartly
with
then
on
the
way
not
so
much
as
a
cat
upon
the
avignon
road
all
the
doors
closed
and
no
lights
in
the
casements
all
was
black
except
for
the
parish
lamps
well
spaced
apart
blinking
in
the
river
mist
calm
and
proud
tartarin
of
tarascon
marched
on
in
the
night
ringing
his
heels
with
regularity
and
sending
sparks
out
of
the
with
the
ferule
of
his
stick
whether
in
avenues
streets
or
lanes
he
took
care
to
keep
in
the
middle
of
the
road
an
excellent
method
of
precaution
allowing
one
to
see
danger
coming
and
above
all
to
avoid
any
droppings
from
windows
as
happens
after
dark
in
tarascon
and
the
old
town
of
edinburgh
on
seeing
so
much
prudence
in
tartarin
pray
do
not
conclude
that
tartarin
had
any
fear
dear
no
he
only
was
on
his
guard
the
best
proof
that
tartarin
was
not
scared
is
that
instead
of
going
to
the
club
by
the
shortest
cut
he
went
over
the
town
by
the
longest
and
darkest
way
round
through
a
mass
of
vile
paltry
alleys
at
the
mouth
of
which
the
rhone
could
be
seen
ominously
gleaming
the
poor
knight
constantly
hoped
that
beyond
the
turn
of
one
of
these
haunts
they
would
leap
from
the
shadow
and
fall
on
his
back
i
warrant
you
they
would
have
been
warmly
received
though
but
alack
by
reason
of
some
nasty
meanness
of
destiny
never
indeed
did
tartarin
of
tarascon
enjoy
the
luck
to
meet
any
ugly
customers
not
so
much
as
a
dog
or
a
drunken
man
nothing
at
all
still
there
were
false
alarms
somewhiles
he
would
catch
a
sound
of
steps
and
muffled
voices
ware
hawks
tartarin
would
mutter
and
stop
short
as
if
taking
root
on
the
spot
scrutinising
the
gloom
sniffing
the
wind
even
glueing
his
ear
to
the
ground
in
the
orthodox
red
indian
mode
the
steps
would
draw
nearer
and
the
voices
grow
more
distinct
till
no
more
doubt
was
possible
they
were
coming
in
fact
here
they
were
steady
with
eye
afire
and
heaving
breast
tartarin
would
gather
himself
like
a
jaguar
in
readiness
to
spring
forward
whilst
uttering
his
when
all
of
a
sudden
out
of
the
thick
of
the
murkiness
he
would
hear
honest
tarasconian
voices
quite
tranquilly
hailing
him
with
hullo
you
by
jove
it
s
tartarin
good
night
old
fellow
maledictions
upon
it
it
was
the
chemist
bezuquet
with
his
family
coming
from
singing
their
family
ballad
at
costecalde
s
oh
good
even
good
even
tartarin
would
growl
furious
at
his
blunder
and
plunging
fiercely
into
the
gloom
with
his
cane
waved
on
high
on
arriving
in
the
street
where
stood
his
the
dauntless
one
would
linger
yet
a
moment
walking
up
and
down
before
the
portals
ere
entering
but
finally
weary
of
awaiting
them
and
certain
they
would
not
show
themselves
he
would
fling
a
last
glare
of
defiance
into
the
shades
and
snarl
wrathfully
nothing
nothing
at
all
there
never
is
nothing
upon
which
double
negation
which
he
meant
as
a
stronger
affirmative
the
worthy
champion
would
walk
in
to
play
his
game
of
bezique
with
the
commandant
vi
the
two
tartarins
answer
me
you
will
say
how
the
mischief
is
it
that
tartarin
of
tarascon
never
left
tarascon
with
all
this
mania
for
adventure
need
of
powerful
sensations
and
folly
about
travel
rides
and
journeys
from
the
pole
to
the
equator
for
that
is
a
fact
up
to
the
age
of
the
dreadless
tarasconian
had
never
once
slept
outside
his
own
room
he
had
not
even
taken
that
obligatory
trip
to
marseilles
which
every
sound
provencal
makes
upon
coming
of
age
the
most
of
his
knowledge
included
beaucaire
and
yet
that
s
not
far
from
tarascon
there
being
merely
the
bridge
to
go
over
unfortunately
this
rascally
bridge
has
so
often
been
blown
away
by
the
gales
it
is
so
long
and
frail
and
the
rhone
has
such
a
width
at
this
spot
that
well
faith
you
understand
tartarin
of
tarascon
preferred
terra
firma
we
are
afraid
we
must
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
in
our
hero
there
were
two
very
distinct
characters
some
father
of
the
church
has
said
i
feel
there
are
two
men
in
he
would
have
spoken
truly
in
saying
this
about
tartarin
who
carried
in
his
frame
the
soul
of
don
quixote
the
same
chivalric
impulses
heroic
ideal
and
crankiness
for
the
grandiose
and
romantic
but
worse
is
the
luck
he
had
not
the
body
of
the
celebrated
hidalgo
that
thin
and
meagre
apology
for
a
body
on
which
material
life
failed
to
take
a
hold
one
that
could
get
through
twenty
nights
without
its
being
unbuckled
off
and
hours
on
a
handful
of
rice
on
the
contrary
tartarin
s
body
was
a
stout
honest
bully
of
a
body
very
fat
very
weighty
most
sensual
and
fond
of
coddling
highly
touchy
full
of
appetite
and
homely
requirements
the
short
paunchy
body
on
stumps
of
the
immortal
sancho
panza
don
quixote
and
sancho
panza
in
the
one
same
man
you
will
readily
comprehend
what
a
couple
they
made
what
strife
what
oh
the
fine
dialogue
for
lucian
or
to
write
between
the
two
tartarins
and
firing
up
on
the
stories
of
gustave
aimard
and
shouting
up
and
at
em
and
thinking
only
of
the
rheumatics
ahead
and
murmuring
i
mean
to
stay
at
the
duet
highly
excited
quite
calmly
cover
yourself
with
glory
tartarin
cover
yourself
tartarin
with
flannel
still
more
excitedly
still
more
calmly
o
for
the
terrible
o
for
the
thick
knitted
barrelled
rifle
o
for
waistcoats
and
warm
lassoes
o
for
the

all
ringing
up
the
maid

jeannette
do
bring
up
that
chocolate
whereupon
jeannette
would
appear
with
an
unusually
good
cup
of
chocolate
just
right
in
warmth
sweetly
smelling
and
with
the
play
of
light
on
watered
silk
upon
its
unctuous
surface
and
with
succulent
grilled
steak
flavoured
with
which
would
set
off
on
the
broad
grin
and
into
a
laugh
that
drowned
the
shouts
of
thus
it
came
about
that
tartarin
of
tarascon
never
had
left
tarascon
vii
tartarin
the
europeans
at
shanghai
commerce
the
tartars
can
tartarin
of
tarascon
be
an
impostor
the
mirage
under
one
conjunction
of
circumstances
tartarin
did
however
once
almost
start
out
upon
a
great
voyage
the
three
brothers
relatives
of
tarascon
established
in
business
at
shanghai
offered
him
the
managership
of
one
of
their
branches
there
this
undoubtedly
presented
the
kind
of
life
he
hankered
after
plenty
of
active
business
a
whole
army
of
to
order
about
and
connections
with
russia
persia
turkey
in
asia
in
short
to
be
a
merchant
prince
in
tartarin
s
mouth
the
title
of
merchant
prince
thundered
out
as
something
stunning
the
house
of
had
the
further
advantage
of
sometimes
being
favoured
with
a
call
from
the
tartars
then
the
doors
would
be
slammed
shut
all
the
clerks
flew
to
arms
up
ran
the
consular
flag
and
zizz
phit
bang
out
of
the
windows
upon
the
tartars
i
need
not
tell
you
with
what
enthusiasm
clutched
this
proposition
sad
to
say
did
not
see
it
in
the
same
light
and
as
he
was
the
stronger
party
it
never
came
to
anything
but
in
the
town
there
was
much
talk
about
it
would
he
go
or
would
he
not
i
ll
lay
he
will
and
i
ll
wager
he
won
t
it
was
the
event
of
the
week
in
the
upshot
tartarin
did
not
depart
but
the
matter
redounded
to
his
credit
none
the
less
going
or
not
going
to
shanghai
was
all
one
to
tarascon
tartarin
s
journey
was
so
much
talked
about
that
people
got
to
believe
he
had
done
it
and
returned
and
at
the
club
in
the
evening
members
would
actually
ask
for
information
on
life
at
shanghai
the
manners
and
customs
and
climate
about
opium
and
commerce
deeply
read
up
tartarin
would
graciously
furnish
the
particulars
desired
and
in
the
end
the
good
fellow
was
not
quite
sure
himself
about
not
having
gone
to
shanghai
so
that
after
relating
for
the
hundredth
time
how
the
tartars
came
down
on
the
trading
post
it
would
most
naturally
happen
him
to
add
then
i
made
my
men
take
up
arms
and
hoist
the
consular
flag
and
zizz
phit
bang
out
of
the
windows
upon
the
on
hearing
this
the
whole
club
would
quiver
but
according
to
that
this
tartarin
of
yours
is
an
awful
no
no
a
thousand
times
over
no
tartarin
was
no
but
the
man
ought
to
know
that
he
has
never
been
to
shanghai
why
of
course
he
knows
that
but
still
but
still
you
see
mark
that
it
is
high
time
for
the
law
to
be
laid
down
once
for
all
on
the
reputation
as
drawers
of
the
long
bow
which
northerners
fling
at
southerners
there
are
no
baron
munchausens
in
the
south
of
france
neither
at
nimes
nor
marseilles
toulouse
nor
tarascon
the
southerner
does
not
deceive
but
is
he
does
not
always
tell
the
truth
but
he
believes
he
does
his
falsehood
is
not
any
such
thing
but
a
kind
of
mental
mirage
yes
purely
mirage
the
better
to
follow
me
you
should
actually
follow
me
into
the
south
and
you
will
see
i
am
right
you
have
only
to
look
at
that
lucifer
s
own
country
where
the
sun
transmogrifies
everything
and
magnifies
it
beyond
the
little
hills
of
provence
are
no
bigger
than
the
butte
montmartre
but
they
will
loom
up
like
the
rocky
mountains
the
square
house
at
nimes
a
mere
model
to
put
on
your
sideboard
will
seem
grander
than
peter
s
you
will
see
in
brief
the
only
exaggerator
in
the
south
is
old
sol
for
he
does
enlarge
everything
he
touches
what
was
sparta
in
its
days
of
splendour
a
pitiful
hamlet
what
was
athens
at
the
most
a
town
and
yet
in
history
both
appear
to
us
as
enormous
cities
this
is
a
sample
of
what
the
sun
can
do
are
you
going
to
be
astonished
after
this
that
the
same
sun
falling
upon
tarascon
should
have
made
of
an
in
the
army
clothing
factory
like
bravida
the
brave
commandant
of
a
sprout
an
indian
and
of
a
man
who
had
missed

who

s
menagerie
a

from
the
atlas
at

a
solemn
and
fearsome
confrontation
exhibiting
tartarin
of
tarascon
as
we
are
in
his
private
life
before
fame
kissed
his
brow
and
garlanded
him
with
her
laurel
wreath
and
having
narrated
his
heroic
existence
in
a
modest
state
his
delights
and
sorrows
his
dreams
and
his
hopes
let
us
hurriedly
skip
to
the
grandest
pages
of
his
story
and
to
the
singular
event
which
was
to
give
the
first
flight
to
his
incomparable
career
it
happened
one
evening
at
costecalde
the
gunmaker
s
where
tartarin
was
engaged
in
showing
several
sportsmen
the
working
of
the
then
in
its
first
novelty
the
door
suddenly
flew
open
and
in
rushed
a
bewildered
howling
a
lion
a
lion
general
was
the
alarm
stupor
uproar
and
tumult
tartarin
prepared
to
resist
cavalry
with
the
bayonet
whilst
costecalde
ran
to
shut
the
door
the
sportsman
was
surrounded
and
pressed
and
questioned
and
here
follows
what
he
told
them
mitaine
s
menagerie
returning
from
beaucaire
fair
had
consented
to
stay
over
a
few
days
at
tarascon
and
was
just
unpacking
to
set
up
the
show
on
the
with
a
lot
of
boas
seals
crocodiles
and
a
magnificent
lion
from

mountains
an
african
lion
in
tarascon
never
in
the
memory
of
living
man
had
the
like
been
seen
hence
our
dauntless
looked
at
one
another
how
proudly
what
a
beaming
on
their
sunburned
visages
and
in
every
nook
of
costecalde
s
shop
what
hearty
congratulatory
grips
of
the
hand
were
silently
exchanged
the
sensation
was
so
great
and
unforeseen
that
nobody
could
find
a
word
to
say

couple
of
strides
off

mind
you
the
beast
heroic
and
ferocious
above
all
others
the
king
of
the
brute
creation
the
crowning
game
of
his
fancies
something
like
the
leading
actor
in
the
ideal
company
which
played
such
splendid
tragedies
in
his
mind
s
eye
a
lion
heaven
be
thanked
and
from
the
atlas
to
boot
it
was
more
than
the
great
tartarin
could
bear
suddenly
a
flush
of
blood
flew
into
his
face
his
eyes
flashed
with
one
convulsive
movement
he
shouldered
the
and
turning
towards
the
brave
commandant
bravida
formerly
captain
in
the
army
clothing
department
please
to
remember
he
thundered
to
him
let
s
go
have
a
look
at
him
here
here
i
say
that
s
my
gun
my
you
are
carrying
off
timidly
ventured
the
wary
costecalde
but
tartarin
had
already
got
round
the
corner
with
all
the
proudly
behind
him
when
they
arrived
at
the
menagerie
they
found
a
goodly
number
of
people
there
tarascon
heroic
but
too
long
deprived
of
sensational
shows
had
rushed
upon
mitaine
s
portable
theatre
and
had
taken
it
by
storm
hence
the
voluminous
madame
mitaine
was
highly
contented
in
an
arab
costume
her
arms
bare
to
the
elbow
iron
anklets
on
a
whip
in
one
hand
and
a
plucked
though
live
pullet
in
the
other
the
noted
lady
was
doing
the
honours
of
the
booth
to
the
tarasconians
and
as
she
also
had
double
muscles
her
success
was
almost
as
great
as
her
animals
the
entrance
of
tartarin
with
the
gun
on
his
shoulder
was
a
damper
all
our
good
tarasconians
who
had
been
quite
tranquilly
strolling
before
the
cages
unarmed
and
with
no
distrust
without
even
any
idea
of
danger
felt
momentary
apprehension
naturally
enough
on
beholding
their
mighty
tartarin
rush
into
the
enclosure
with
his
formidable
engine
of
war
there
must
be
something
to
fear
when
a
hero
like
he
was
came
weaponed
so
in
a
twinkling
all
the
space
along
the
cage
fronts
was
cleared
the
youngsters
burst
out
squalling
for
fear
and
the
women
looked
round
for
the
nearest
way
out
the
chemist
bezuquet
made
off
altogether
alleging
that
he
was
going
home
for
his
gun
gradually
however
tartarin
s
bearing
restored
courage
with
head
erect
the
intrepid
tarasconian
slowly
and
calmly
made
the
circuit
of
the
booth
passing
the
seal
s
tank
without
stopping
glancing
disdainfully
on
the
long
box
filled
with
sawdust
in
which
the
boa
would
digest
its
raw
fowl
and
going
to
take
his
stand
before
the
lion
s
cage
a
terrible
and
solemn
confrontation
this
the
lion
of
tarascon
and
the
lion
of
africa
face
to
face
on
the
one
part
tartarin
erect
with
his
hamstrings
in
tension
and
his
arms
folded
on
his
gun
barrel
on
the
other
the
lion
a
gigantic
specimen
humped
up
in
the
straw
with
blinking
orbs
and
brutish
mien
resting
his
huge
muzzle
and
tawny
wig
on
his
forepaws
both
calm
in
their
gaze
singular
thing
whether
the
had
given
him
the
needle
if
the
popular
idiom
is
admissible
or
that
he
scented
an
enemy
of
his
race
the
lion
who
had
hitherto
regarded
the
tarasconians
with
sovereign
scorn
and
yawned
in
their
faces
was
all
at
once
affected
by
ire
at
first
he
sniffed
then
he
growled
hollowly
stretching
out
his
claws
rising
he
tossed
his
head
shook
his
mane
opened
a
capacious
maw
and
belched
a
deafening
roar
at
tartarin
a
yell
of
fright
responded
as
tarascon
precipitated
itself
madly
towards
the
exit
women
and
children
lightermen
even
the
brave
commandant
bravida
himself
but
alone
tartarin
of
tarascon
had
not
budged
there
he
stood
firm
and
resolute
before
the
cage
lightnings
in
his
eyes
and
on
his
lip
that
gruesome
grin
with
which
all
the
town
was
familiar
in
a
moment
s
time
when
all
the
some
little
fortified
by
his
bearing
and
the
strength
of
the
bars
their
leader
they
heard
him
mutter
as
he
stared
leo
out
of
countenance
now
this
is
something
like
a
hunt
all
the
rest
of
that
day
never
a
word
farther
could
they
draw
from
tartarin
of
tarascon
ix
singular
effects
of
mental
mirage
confining
his
remarks
to
the
sentence
last
recorded
tartarin
had
unfortunately
still
said
overmuch
on
the
morrow
there
was
nothing
talked
about
through
town
but
the
departure
of
tartarin
for
algeria
and
you
are
all
witness
dear
readers
that
the
honest
fellow
had
not
breathed
a
word
on
that
head
but
you
know
the
mirage
had
its
usual
effect
in
brief
all
tarascon
spoke
of
nothing
but
the
departure
on
the
old
walk
at
the
club
in
costecalde
s
friends
accosted
one
another
with
a
startled
aspect
and
furthermore
you
know
the
news
at
least
and
furthermore
rather
tartarin
s
setting
out
at
least
for
at
tarascon
all
phrases
begin
with
and
furthermore
and
conclude
with
at
least
with
a
strong
local
accent
hence
on
this
occasion
more
than
upon
others
these
peculiarities
rang
out
till
the
windows
shivered
the
most
surprised
of
men
in
the
town
on
hearing
that
tartarin
was
going
away
to
africa
was
tartarin
himself
but
only
see
what
vanity
is
instead
of
plumply
answering
that
he
was
not
going
at
all
and
had
not
even
had
the
intention
poor
tartarin
on
the
first
of
them
mentioning
the
journey
to
him
observed
with
a
neat
little
evasive
air
aha
maybe
i
shall
but
i
do
not
say
as
the
second
time
a
trifle
more
familiarised
with
the
idea
he
replied
very
likely
and
the
third
time
it
s
finally
in
the
evening
at
costecalde
s
and
the
club
carried
away
by
the
cheers
and
illumination
intoxicated
by
the
impression
that
bare
announcement
of
his
departure
had
made
on
the
town
the
hapless
fellow
formally
declared
that
he
was
sick
of
banging
away
at
caps
and
that
he
would
shortly
be
on
the
trail
of
the
great
lions
of
the
atlas
a
deafening
hurrah
greeted
this
assertion
whereupon
more
bravoes
handshaking
slappings
of
the
shoulder
and
a
torchlight
serenade
up
to
midnight
before
baobab
villa
it
was
who
was
anything
but
delighted
this
idea
of
travel
in
africa
and
made
him
shudder
beforehand
and
when
the
house
was
and
whilst
the
complimentary
concert
was
sounding
under
the
windows
he
had
a
dreadful
row
with
calling
him
a
cracked
head
a
visionary
imprudent
and
thrice
an
idiot
and
detailing
by
the
card
all
the
catastrophes
awaiting
him
on
such
an
expedition
shipwreck
rheumatism
yellow
fever
dysentery
the
black
plague
elephantiasis
and
the
rest
of
them
in
vain
did
vow
that
he
had
not
committed
any
imprudence
that
he
would
wrap
himself
up
well
and
take
even
superfluous
necessaries
with
him
would
listen
to
nothing
the
poor
craven
saw
himself
already
torn
to
tatters
by
the
lions
or
engulfed
in
the
desert
sands
like
his
late
royal
highness
cambyses
and
the
other
tartarin
only
managed
to
appease
him
a
little
by
explaining
that
the
start
was
not
immediate
as
nothing
pressed
it
is
clear
enough
indeed
that
none
embark
on
such
an
enterprise
without
some
preparations
a
man
is
bound
to
know
whither
he
goes
hang
it
all
and
not
fly
off
like
a
bird
before
anything
else
the
tarasconian
wanted
to
peruse
the
accounts
of
great
african
tourists
the
narrations
of
mungo
park
du
chaillu
livingstone
stanley
and
so
on
in
them
he
learnt
that
these
daring
explorers
before
donning
their
sandals
for
distant
excursions
hardened
themselves
well
beforehand
to
support
hunger
and
thirst
forced
marches
and
all
kinds
of
privation
tartarin
meant
to
act
like
they
did
and
from
that
day
forward
he
lived
upon
water
broth
alone
the
water
broth
of
tarascon
is
a
few
slices
of
bread
drowned
in
hot
water
with
a
clove
of
garlic
a
pinch
of
thyme
and
a
sprig
of
laurel
strict
diet
at
which
you
may
believe
poor
sancho
made
a
wry
face
to
the
regimen
of
water
broth
tartarin
of
tarascon
joined
other
wise
practices
to
break
himself
into
the
habit
of
long
marches
he
constrained
himself
to
go
round
the
town
seven
or
eight
times
consecutively
every
morning
either
at
the
fast
walk
or
run
his
elbows
well
set
against
his
body
and
a
couple
of
white
pebbles
in
the
mouth
according
to
the
antique
usage
to
get
inured
to
fog
dew
and
night
coolness
he
would
go
down
into
his
garden
every
dusk
and
stop
out
there
till
ten
or
eleven
alone
with
his
gun
on
the
lookout
behind
the
baobab
finally
so
long
as
mitaine
s
wild
beast
show
tarried
in
tarascon
the
who
were
belated
at
costecalde
s
might
spy
in
the
shadow
of
the
booth
as
they
crossed
the
a
mysterious
figure
stalking
up
and
down
it
was
tartarin
of
tarascon
habituating
himself
to
hear
without
emotion
the
roarings
of
the
lion
in
the
sombre
night
x
before
the
start
pending
tartarin
s
delay
of
the
event
by
all
sorts
of
heroic
means
all
tarascon
kept
an
eye
upon
him
and
nothing
else
was
busied
about
was
winged
and
dead
the
piano
in
bezuquet
s
shop
mouldered
away
under
a
green
fungus
and
the
spanish
flies
dried
upon
it
belly
up
tartarin
s
expedition
had
a
put
a
stopper
on
everything
ah
you
ought
to
have
seen
his
success
in
the
parlours
he
was
snatched
away
by
one
from
another
fought
for
loaned
and
borrowed
ay
stolen
there
was
no
greater
honour
for
the
ladies
than
to
go
to
mitaine
s
menagerie
on
tartarin
s
arms
and
have
it
explained
before
the
lion
s
den
how
such
large
game
are
hunted
where
they
should
be
aimed
at
at
how
many
paces
off
if
the
accidents
were
numerous
and
the
like
of
that
tartarin
furnished
all
the
elucidation
desired
he
had
read
the
life
of
jules
gerard
the
and
had
at
his
finger
ends
as
if
he
had
been
through
it
himself
hence
he
orated
upon
these
matters
with
great
eloquence
but
where
he
shone
the
brightest
was
at
dinner
at
chief
judge
ladeveze
s
or
brave
commandant
bravida
s
the
former
captain
in
the
army
clothing
factory
you
will
keep
in
mind
when
coffee
came
in
and
all
the
chairs
were
brought
up
closer
together
whilst
they
chatted
of
his
future
hunts
thereupon
his
elbow
on
the
cloth
his
nose
over
his
mocha
our
hero
would
discourse
in
a
feeling
tone
of
all
the
dangers
awaiting
him
thereaway
he
spoke
of
the
long
moonless
night
the
pestilential
fens
the
rivers
envenomed
by
leaves
of
the
deep
the
scorching
suns
the
scorpions
and
rains
of
grasshoppers
he
also
descanted
on
the
peculiarities
of
the
great
lions
of
the
atlas
their
way
of
fighting
their
phenomenal
vigour
and
their
ferocity
in
the
mating
season
heating
with
his
own
recital
he
would
rise
from
table
bounding
to
the
middle
of
the
imitating
the
roar
of
a
lion
and
the
going
off
of
a
rifle
crack
bang
the
zizz
of
the
explosive
bullet
gesticulating
and
roaring
about
till
he
had
overset
the
chairs
everybody
turned
pale
around
the
board
the
gentlemen
looking
at
one
another
and
wagging
their
heads
the
ladies
shutting
their
eyes
with
pretty
screams
of
fright
the
elderly
men
combatively
brandishing
their
canes
and
in
the
side
apartments
the
little
boys
who
had
been
put
to
bed
betimes
were
greatly
startled
by
the
sudden
outcries
and
imitated
and
screamed
for
lights
meanwhile
tartarin
did
not
start
xi
let
s
have
it
out
with
swords
gentleman
not
pins
a
delicate
question
whether
tartarin
really
had
any
intention
of
going
and
one
which
the
historian
of
tartarin
would
be
highly
embarrassed
to
answer
in
plain
words
mitaine
s
menagerie
had
left
tarascon
over
three
months
and
still
the
had
not
started
after
all
blinded
by
a
new
mirage
our
candid
hero
may
have
imagined
in
perfectly
good
faith
that
he
had
gone
to
algeria
on
the
strength
of
having
related
his
future
hunts
he
may
have
believed
he
had
performed
them
as
sincerely
as
he
fancied
he
had
hoisted
the
consular
flag
and
fired
on
the
tartars
zizz
phit
bang
at
shanghai
unfortunately
granting
tartarin
was
this
time
again
dupe
of
an
illusion
his
were
not
when
after
the
quarter
s
expectation
they
perceived
that
the
hunter
had
not
packed
even
a
they
commenced
murmuring
this
is
going
to
turn
out
like
the
shanghai
expedition
remarked
costecalde
smiling
the
gunsmith
s
comment
was
welcomed
all
over
town
for
nobody
believed
any
longer
in
their
late
idol
the
simpletons
and
poltroons
all
the
fellows
of
bezuquet
s
stamp
whom
a
flea
would
put
to
flight
and
who
could
not
fire
a
shot
without
closing
their
eyes
were
conspicuously
pitiless
in
the
or
on
the
esplanade
they
accosted
poor
tartarin
with
bantering
mien
and
furthermore
when
is
that
trip
coming
off
in
costecalde
s
shop
his
opinions
gained
no
credence
for
the
renounced
their
chief
next
epigrams
dropped
into
the
affair
chief
judge
ladevese
who
willingly
paid
court
in
his
leisure
hours
to
the
native
muse
composed
in
local
dialect
a
song
which
won
much
success
it
told
of
a
sportsman
called
master
gervais
whose
dreaded
rifle
was
bound
to
exterminate
all
the
lions
in
africa
to
the
very
last
unluckily
this
terrible
gun
was
of
a
strange
kind
though
loaded
daily
it
never
went
it
never
went
off
you
will
catch
the
drift
in
less
than
no
time
this
ditty
became
popular
and
when
tartarin
came
by
the
longshoremen
and
the
little
shoeblacks
before
his
door
sang
in

it
was
shouted
out
from
a
safe
distance
on
account
of
the
double
muscles
oh
the
fragility
of
tarascon
s
fads
the
great
object
himself
feigned
to
see
and
hear
nothing
but
under
the
surface
this
sullen
and
venomous
petty
warfare
much
afflicted
him
he
felt
aware
that
tarascon
was
slipping
out
of
his
grip
and
that
popular
favour
was
going
to
others
and
this
made
him
suffer
horribly
ah
the
huge
bowl
of
popularity
it
s
all
very
well
to
have
a
seat
in
front
of
it
but
what
a
scalding
you
catch
when
it
is
overturned
notwithstanding
his
pain
tartarin
smiled
and
peacefully
jogged
on
in
the
same
life
as
if
nothing
untoward
had
happened
still
the
mask
of
jovial
heedlessness
glued
by
pride
on
his
face
would
sometimes
be
suddenly
detached
then
in
lieu
of
laughter
one
saw
grief
and
indignation
thus
it
was
that
one
morning
when
the
little
blackguards
yelped
muster
jarvey
s
roifle
beneath
his
window
the
wretches
voices
rose
even
into
the
poor
great
man
s
room
where
he
was
shaving
before
the
glass
tartarin
wore
a
full
beard
but
as
it
grew
very
thick
he
was
obliged
to
keep
it
trimmed
orderly
all
at
once
the
window
was
violently
opened
and
tartarin
appeared
in
and
nightcap
smothered
in
lather
flourishing
his
razor
and
and
roaring
with
a
formidable
voice
let
s
have
it
out
with

fine
words
worthy
of

record
with
only
the

that

were
addressed

a
memorable
dialogue

out

to

him
the

to

bezuquet
s
not
once
did
the
brave
officer
let
out
any
allusion
to
the
trip
to
africa
but
when
the
public
clamour
grew
too
loud
he
determined
to
have
his
say
one
evening
the
luckless
tartarin
was
in
his
study
in
a
brown
study
himself
when
he
saw
the
commandant
stride
in
stern
wearing
black
gloves
buttoned
up
to
his
ears
tartarin
said
the
authoritatively
tartarin
you
ll
have
to
go
and
there
he
dwelt
erect
in
the
doorway
frame
grand
and
rigid
as
embodied
duty
tartarin
of
tarascon
comprehended
all
the
sense
in
tartarin
you
ll
have
to
ago
very
pale
he
rose
and
looked
around
with
a
softened
eye
upon
the
cosy
snuggery
tightly
closed
in
full
of
warmth
and
tender
light
upon
the
commodious
easy
chair
his
books
the
carpet
the
white
blinds
of
the
windows
beyond
which
trembled
the
slender
twigs
of
the
little
garden
then
advancing
towards
the
brave
officer
he
took
his
hand
grasped
it
energetically
and
said
in
a
voice
somewhat
tearful
but
stoical
for
all
that
i
am
going
and
go
he
did
as
he
said
he
would
not
straight
off
though
for
it
takes
time
to
get
the
paraphernalia
together
to
begin
with
he
ordered
of
bompard
two
large
boxes
bound
with
brass
and
an
inscription
to
be
on
them
i
tartarin
of
tarascon
i
i
firearms
i
the
binding
in
brass
and
the
lettering
took
much
time
he
also
ordered
at
tastavin
s
a
showy
album
in
which
to
keep
a
diary
and
his
impressions
of
travel
for
a
man
can
not
help
having
an
idea
or
two
strike
him
even
when
he
is
busy
next
he
had
over
from
marseilles
a
downright
cargo
of
tinned
eatables
pemmican
compressed
in
cakes
for
making
soup
a
new
pattern

up

the

made
him
up
a
miniature
portable
medicine
chest
stuffed
with
diachylon
plaister
arnica
camphor
and
medicated
vinegar
poor
tartarin
he
did
not
take
these
safeguards
on
his
own

but
he
hoped
by
dint
of
precaution
and
delicate
attentions
to
allay

since
the

was

never
left
off

been

encumbering

in

the

moreover
people
from

had
come
over
the

from
the
environs
carters
in
their
huge
carts
with
ample
tilts
vinedressers
upon
handsome
mules
tricked
out
with
ribbons

and
jingles
and
even
here
and
there
a
few
pretty
maids
from
arles
come
on
the
pillion
behind
their
sweethearts
with
bonny
blue
ribbons
round
the
head
upon

all
this
swarm
squeezed
and
jostled

that
s
a

digression
in

of
their

gravely
lounging
about

at

the

started
and

in

when

appeared
upon

burst
from
the
assemblage

s
got
on

in

tartarin
of

had
deemed
it
his

to

the

with

came
in

to

was
rather
too
fierce
in

hurrah
for

roared
the
populace
the
great
man
smiled
but
did
not
salute
on
account
of
the
firearms
hindering
him
moreover
he
knew
now
on
what
popular
favour
depends
it
may
even
be
that
in
the
depths
of
his
soul
he
cursed
his
terrible
who
obliged
him
to
go
away
and
leave
his
pretty
little
with
whitened
walls
and
green
venetians
but
there
was
no
show
of
this
calm
and
proud
although
a
little
pallid
he
stepped
out
on
the
footway
glanced
at
the

seeing
all
was
right
lustily
took
the

to

embraced
his

collectively
in

he
leaped
out
upon

clambered
into

carriage
full
of

upon
the
of

in

brilliant

weather
under

winter
sun
the
startled
inhabitants
of

beheld
a

down

their

street
a
turk
a
regular
turk
never

such
a
one

there

i
any
necessity
of
telling
you
it
was
the
great
tartarin
of
tarascon
waddled
along
the
quays
followed
by
his
and
tinned
comestibles
to
reach
the
of
the
touache
company
and
the
mail
steamer
the
zouave
which
was
to
transport
him
over
the
sea
with
his
ears
still
ringing
with
the
home
applause
intoxicated
by
the
glare
of
the
heavens
and
the
reek
of
the

tartarin
fairly
beamed
as
he
stepped
out
with
a
lofty
head
and
between
his
guns
on
his
shoulders
looking
with
all
his
eyes
upon
that
wondrous
dazzling
harbour
of
marseilles
which
he
saw
for
the
first
time
the
poor
fellow
believed
he
was
dreaming
he
fancied
his
name
was
sinbad

that
he
was
roaming
in

was
the

the
fez
so
defiant
at
the
sailing
now
reduced
to
the
vulgar
condition
of
a
nightcap
and
pulled
down
over
the
very
ears
of
the
head
of
a
pallid
and
convulsed
sufferer
how
the
people
of
tarascon
would
have
kicked
themselves
for
having
constrained
the
great
tartarin
to
leave
home
if

him
stretched
in
the
bunk
in
the
dull
wan
gleam
through
the
amid
the
sickly
odour
of
cooking
and
wet
wood
the
perfume
of
if
they
had
but
heard
him
gurgle
at
every
turn
of
the
screw
wail
for
tea
every
five
minutes
and
swear
at
the
steward
in
a
childish
treble

hapless
victim

power
to
undo

aside

armoury

pounded

ribs
and
the
leather
made
his
thigh
raw
to
finish
him
arose
the
taunts
of
who
never
ceased
to
groan
and
inveigh
well
for
the
biggest
kind
of
imbecile
you

the
cruellest
part
of

from
the
retreat
where
he
was
moaning
the
hapless
invalid
could
hear
the
passengers
in
the
grand
saloon
laughing
munching

jolly
as
numerous
composed
of
officers
going
back
to
join
their
regiments
ladies
from
the
marseilles
alcazar
music
hall
a
rich
mussulman
returning
from
mecca
and
a
very
jocular
montenegrin
prince
who
favoured
them
with
imitations
of
the
low
comedians
of
paris
not
one
of
these
jokers
felt
the
and
their
time
was
passed
in
quaffing
champagne
with
the
steamer
captain
a
good
fat
born
marseillais
who
had
a
wife
and
family
as
well
at
algiers
as
at
home
and
who
answered
to
the
merry
name
of
barbassou
tartarin
of
tarascon
hated
this
pack
of
wretches
their
mirthfulness
deepened
his
ails
at
length
on
the
third
afternoon
there
was
such
an
extraordinary
hullabaloo
on
the
deck
that
our
hero
was
roused
out
of
his
long
torpor
the
ship
s
bell
was
ringing
and
the
seamen
s
heavy
boots
ran
over
the
planks
go
ahead
stop
her
turn
astern
barked
the
hoarse
voice
of
captain
barbassou
and
then
stop
her
dead
there
was
an
abrupt
check
of
movement
a
shock
and
no
more
save
the
silent
rolling
of
the
boat
from
side
to
side
like
a
balloon
in
the
air
this
strange
stillness
alarmed
the
tarasconian
heaven
ha
mercy
upon
us
he
yelled
in
a
terrifying
voice
as
recovering
his
strength
by
magic
he
bounded
out
of
his
berth
and
rushed
upon
deck
with
his
arsenal
ii
to
arms
to
arms
only
the
arrival
not
a
foundering
the
zouave
was
just
gliding
into
the
roadstead
a
fine
one
of
black
deep
water
but
dull
and
still
almost
deserted
on
elevated
ground
ahead
rose
algiers
the
white
city
with
its
little
houses
of
a
dead
huddling
against
one
another
lest
they
slid
into
the
sea
it
was
like
meudon
slope
with
a
laundress
s
washing
hung
out
to
dry
over
it
a
vast
blue
satin
sky
and
such
a
blue
a
little
restored
from
his
fright
the
illustrious
tartarin
gazed
on
the
landscape
and
listened
with
respect
to
the
montenegrin
prince
who
stood
by
his
side
as
he
named
the
different
parts
of
the
capital
the
kasbah
the
upper
town
and
the
rue
a
very
prince
was
this
montenegrin
moreover
knowing
algeria
thoroughly
and
fluently
speaking
arabic
hence
tartarin
thought
of
cultivating
his
acquaintance
all
at
once
along
the
bulwark
against
which
they
were
leaning
the
tarasconian
perceived
a
row
of
large
black
hands
clinging
to
it
from
over
the
side
almost
instantly
a
negro
s
woolly
head
shot
up
before
him
and
ere
he
had
time
to
open
his
mouth
the
deck
was
overwhelmed
on
every
side
by
a
hundred
black
or
yellow
desperadoes
half
naked
hideous
and
fearsome
tartarin
knew
who
these
pirates
were
they
of
course
the
celebrated
they
who
had
too
often
been
hunted
after
by
him
in
the
of
tarascon
at
last
they
had
decided
to
meet
him
face
to
face
at
the
outset
surprise
nailed
him
to
the
spot
but
when
he
saw
the
outlaws
fall
upon
the
luggage
tear
off
the
tarpaulin
covering
and
actually
commence
the
pillage
of
the
ship
then
the
hero
awoke
whipping
out
his
to
arms
to
arms
he
roared
to
the
passengers
and
away
he
flew
the
foremost
of
all
upon
the
buccaneers
ques
aco
what
s
the
stir
what

the

exclaimed
captain

at
this
juncture
a
tall
blackamoor
tore
by
with
our
hero

upon
his
back

just
wait
for

yelled
the
tarasconer
as
he
ran
after
with
the
knife
uplifted
but
barbassou
caught
him
in
the
spring
and
holding
him
by
the
bade
him

and
walk
off
behind
that
nigger
an
honest
dog
who
will
see
you
to
land
and
even
into
a
hotel
if
you
a
little
abashed
tartarin
handed
over
his
ticket
and
falling
in
behind
the
representative
of
the
dark
continent
clambered
down
by
the
into
a
big
skiff
dancing
alongside
all
his
effects
were
already
there
boxes
trunks
tinned
food
so
cramming
up
the
boat
that
there
was
no
need
to
wait
for
any
other
passengers
the
african
scrambled
upon
the
boxes
and
squatted
there
like
a
baboon
with
his
knees
clutched
by
his
hands
another
negro
took
the
oars
both
laughingly
eyed
tartarin
and
showed
their
white
teeth
standing
in
the
making
that
terrifying
face
which
had
daunted
his
the
great
tarasconian
feverishly
fumbled
with
his
haft
for
despite
what
barbassou
had
told
him
he
was
only
half
at
ease
as
regarded
the
intention
of
these
porters
who
so
little
resembled
their
honest
mates
of
tarascon
five
minutes
afterwards
the
skiff
landed
tartarin
and
he
set
foot
upon
the
little
barbary
wharf
where
three
hundred
years
before
a
spanish
yclept
miguel
cervantes
devised
under
the
cane
of
the
algerian
taskmaster
a
sublime
romance
which
was
to
bear
the
title
of
don
iii
an
invocation
to
cervantes
the
disembarkation
where
are
the
turks
not
a
sign
of
them
disenchantment
o
miguel
cervantes
saavedra
if
what
is
asserted
be
true
to
wit
that
wherever
great
men
have
dwelt
some
emanation
of
their
spirits
wanderingly
hovers
until
the
end
of
ages
then
what
remained
of
your
essence
on
the
barbary
coast
must
have
quivered
with
glee
on
beholding
tartarin
of
tarascon
disembark
that
marvellous
type
of
the
french
southerner
in
whom
was
embodied
both
heroes
of
your
work
don
quixote
and
sancho
panza
the
air
was
sultry
on
this
occasion
on
the
wharf
ablaze
with
sunshine
were
half
a
dozen
revenue
officers
some
algerians
expecting
news
from
france
several
squatting
moors
who
drew
at
long
pipes
and
some
maltese
mariners
dragging
large
nets
between
the
meshes
of
which
thousands
of
sardines
glittered
like
small
silver
coins
but
hardly
had
tartarin
set
foot
on
earth
before
the
quay
sprang
into
life
and
changed
its
aspect
a
horde
of
savages
still
more
hideous
than
the
pirates
upon
the
steamer
rose
between
the
stones
on
the
strand
and
rushed
upon
the
tall
arabs
were
there
nude
under
woollen
blankets
little

in

all
yelling

shouting
hooking
on

fighting
over

luggage
one
carrying
away
the
provender
another
his
and
pelting
him
in
one
fantastic
medley
with
the
names
of
hotels
bewildered
by
all
this
tumult
poor
tartarin
wandered
to
and
fro
swore
and
stormed
went
mad
ran
after
his
property
and
not
knowing
how
to
make
these
barbarians
understand
him
speechified
them
in
french
provencal
and
even
in
dog
latin
rosa
the
rose
bonus
bona
bonum
all
that
he
knew
but
to
no
purpose
he
was
not
heeded
happily
like
a
god
in
homer
intervened
a
little
fellow
in
a
tunic
and
armed
with
a
long
s
cane
who
dispersed
the
whole
with
he
was
a
policeman
of
the
algerian
capital
very
politely
he
suggested
tartarin
should
put
up
at
the
hotel
de
l
europe
and
he
confided
him
to
its
waiters
who
carted
him
and
his
impedimenta
thither
in
several
barrows
at
the
first
steps
he
took
in
algiers
tartarin
of
tarascon
opened
his
eyes
widely
beforehand
he
had
pictured
it
as
an
oriental
city
a
fairy
one
mythological
something
between
constantinople
and
zanzibar
but
it
was
back
into
tarascon
he
fell
cafes
restaurants
wide
streets
houses
a
little
macadamised
where
the
infantry
band
played
offenbachian
polkas
whilst
fashionably
clad
gentlemen
occupied
chairs
drinking
beer
and
eating
pancakes
some
brilliant
ladies
some
shady
ones
and
soldiers
more
soldiers
no
end
of
soldiers
but
not
a
solitary
turk
or
better
to
say
there
was
a
solitary
turk
and
that
was
he
hence
he
felt
a
little
abashed
about
crossing
the
square
for
everybody
looked
at
him
the
musicians
stopped
the
offenbachian
polka
halting
with
one
foot
in
the
air
with
both
guns
on
his
shoulders
and
the
revolver
flapping
on
his
hip
as
fierce
and
stately
as
robinson
crusoe
tartarin
gravely
passed
through
the
groups
but
on
arriving
at
the
hotel
his
powers
failed
him
all
spun
and
mingled
in
his
head
the
departure
from
tarascon
the
harbour
of
marseilles
the
voyage
the
montenegrin
prince
the
corsairs
they
had
to
help
him
up
into
a
room
and
disarm
and
undress
him
they
began
to
talk
of
sending
for
a
medical
adviser
but
hardly
was
our
hero
s
head
upon
the
pillow
than
he
set
to
snoring
so
loudly
and
so
heartily
that
the
landlord
judged
the
succour
of
science
useless
and
everybody
considerately
withdrew
iv
the
first
lying
in
wait
three
o
clock
was
striking
by
the
government
clock
when
tartarin
awoke
he
had
slept
all
the
evening
night
and
morning
and
even
a
goodish
piece
of
the
afternoon
it
must
be
granted
though
that
in
the
last
three
days
the
red
fez
had
caught
it
pretty
hot
and
lively
our
hero
s
first
thought
on
opening
his
eyes
was
i
am
in
the
land
of
the
lions
and
well
why
should
we
not
say
it
at
the
idea
that
lions
were
nigh
hereabouts
within
a
couple
of
steps
almost
at
hand
s
reach
and
that
he
would
have
to
disentangle
a
snarled
skein
with
them
ugh
a
deadly
chill
struck
him
and
he
dived
intrepidly
under
the
coverlet
but
before
a
moment
was
over
the
outward
gaiety
the
blue
sky
the
glowing
sun
that
streamed
into
the
bedchamber
a
nice
little
breakfast
that
he
ate
in
bed
his
window
wide
open
upon
the
sea
the
whole
flavoured
with
an
uncommonly
good
bottle
of
crescia
wine
it
very
speedily
restored
him
his
former
pluckiness
let
s
out
and
at
the
lion
he
exclaimed
throwing
off
the
clothes
and
briskly
dressing
himself
his
plan
was
as
follows
he
would
go
forth
from
the
city
without
saying
a
word
to
a
soul
plunge
into
the
great
desert
await
nightfall
to
ambush
himself
and
bang
away
at
the
first
lion
who
walked
up
then
would
he
return
to
breakfast
in
the
morning
at
the
hotel
receive
the
felicitations
of
the
natives
and
hire
a
cart
to
bring
in
the
quarry
so
he
hurriedly
armed
himself
attached
upright
on
his
back
the
which
when
rolled
up
left
its
centre
pole
sticking
out
a
clear
foot
above
his
head
and
descended
to
the
street
as
stiffly
as
though
he
had
swallowed
it
not
caring
to
ask
the
way
of
anybody
from
fear
of
letting
out
his
project
he
turned
fairly
to
the
right
and
threaded
the
arcade
to
the
very
end
where
swarms
of
algerian
jews
watched
him
pass
from
their
corner
ambushes
like
so
many
spiders
crossing
the
theatre
place
he
entered
the
outer
ward
and
lastly
came
upon
the
dusty
mustapha
highway
upon
this
was
a
quaint
conglomeration
omnibuses
hackney
coaches
corricolos
the
army
service
waggons
huge
drawn
by
bullocks
squads
of
chasseurs
d
afrique
droves
of
microscopic
asses
trucks
of
alsatian
emigrants
spahis
in
scarlet
cloaks
all
filed
by
in
a
whirlwind
cloud
of
dust
amidst
shouts
songs
and
trumpetcalls
between
two
rows
of
booths
at
the
doors
of
which
lanky
mahonnais
women
might
be
seen
doing
their
hair
filled
with
soldiers
and
shops
of
butchers
and
knackers
what
rubbish
to
din
me
about
the
orient
grumbled
the
great
tartarin
there
are
not
even
as
many
turks
here
as
at
all
of
a
sudden
he
saw
a
splendid
camel
strut
by
him
quite
closely
stretching
its
long
legs
and
puffing
out
its
throat
like
a
and
that
made
his
heart
throb
camels
already
eh
lions
could
not
be
far
off
now
and
indeed
in
five
minutes
time
he
did
see
a
whole
band
of
coming
his
way
under
arms
cowards
thought
our
hero
as
he
skirted
them
downright
cowards
to
go
at
a
lion
in
companies
and
with
dogs
for
it
never
could
occur
to
him
that
anything
but
lions
were
objects
of
the
chase
in
algeria
for
all
that
these
nimrods
wore
such
complacent
phizzes
of
retired
tradesmen
and
their
style
of
with
dogs
and
was
so
patriarchal
that
the
tarasconian
a
little
perplexed
deemed
it
incumbent
to
question
one
of
the
gentlemen
and
furthermore
comrade
is
the
sport
good
not
bad
responded
the
other
regarding
the
speaker
s
imposing
warlike
equipment
with
a
scared
eye
killed
any
rather
not
so
bad
only
whereupon
the
algerian
sportsman
showed
that
it
was
rabbits
and
woodcock
stuffing
out
the
bag
what
do
you
call
that
your
bag
do
you
put
in
your
bag
where
else
should
i
put
em
but
it
s
such
little
some
run
small
and
some
run
large
observed
the
hunter
in
haste
to
catch
up
with
his
companions
he
joined
them
with
several
long
strides
the
dauntless
tartarin
remained
rooted
in
the
middle
of
the
road
with
stupefaction
pooh
he
ejaculated
after
a
moment
s
reflection
these
are
jokers
they
haven
t
killed
anything
whatever
and
he
went
his
way
already
the
houses
became
scarcer
and
so
did
the
passengers
dark
came
on
and
objects
were
blurred
though
tartarin
walked
on
for
half
an
hour
more
when
he
stopped
for
it
was
night
a
moonless
night
too
but
sprinkled
with
stars
on
the
highroad
there
was
nobody
the
hero
concluded
that
lions
are
not
and
would
not
of
their
own
choice
travel
the
main
ways
so
he
wheeled
into
the
fields
where
there
were
brambles
and
ditches
and
bushes
at
every
step
but
he
kept
on
nevertheless
but
suddenly
he
halted
i
smell
lions
about
here
said
our
friend
sniffing
right
and
left
bang
bang
certainly
a
great
wilderness
bristling
with
odd
plants
of
that
oriental
kind
which
look
like
wicked
creatures
under
the
feeble
starlight
their
magnified
shadows
barred
the
ground
in
every
way
on
the
right
loomed
up
confusedly
the
heavy
mass
of
a
mountain
perhaps
the
atlas
range
on
the
the
invisible
sea
hollowly
rolling
the
very
spot
to
attract
wild
beasts
with
one
gun
laid
before
him
and
the
other
in
his
grasp
tartarin
of
tarascon
went
down
on
one
knee
and
waited
an
hour
ay
a
good
couple
and
nothing
turned
up
then
he
bethought
him
how
in
his
books
the
great
never
went
out
hunting
without
having
a
lamb
or
a
kid
along
with
them
which
they
tied
up
a
space
before
them
and
set
bleating
or
by
jerking
its
foot
with
a
string
not
having
any
goat
the
tarasconer
had
the
idea
of
employing
an
imitation
and
he
set
to
crying
in
a
tremulous
voice
at
first
it
was
done
very
softly
because
at
bottom
he
was
a
little
alarmed
lest
the
lion
should
hear
him
but
as
nothing
came
he
more
loudly
still
nothing
losing
patience
he
resumed
many
times
running
at
the
top
of
his
voice
till
the
baa
baa
baa
came
out
with
so
much
power
that
the
goat
began
to
be
mistakable
for
a
bull
unexpectedly
a
few
steps
in
front
some
gigantic
black
thing
appeared
he
was
hushed
this
thing
lowered
its
head
sniffed
the
ground
bounded
up
rolled
over
and
darted
off
at
the
gallop
but
returned
and
stopped
short
who
could
doubt
it
was
the
lion
for
now
its
four
short
legs
could
plainly
be
seen
its
formidable
mane
and
its
large
eyes
gleaming
in
the
gloom
up
went
his
gun
into
position
fire
s
the
word
and
bang
bang
it
was
done
and
immediately
there
was
a
leap
back
and

terrible
roaring

he

got
it
cried
our
good
tartarin
as
steadying
himself
on
his
sturdy
supporters
he
prepared
to
receive
the
brute
s
charge
but
it
had
more
than
its
fill
and
galloped
off
howling
he
did
not
budge
for
he
expected
to
see
the
female
mate
appear
as
the
always
lay
it
down
she
should
unhappily
no
female
came
after
two
or
three
hours
waiting
the
tarasconian
grew
tired
the
ground
was
damp
the
night
was
getting
cool
and
the
pricked
sharply
i
have
a
good
mind
to
take
a
nap
till
daylight
he
said
to
himself
to
avoid
catching
rheumatism
he
had
recourse
to
his
patent
tent
but
here
s
where
old
nick
interfered
this
tent
was
of
so
very
ingenious
a
construction
that
he
could
not
manage
to
open
it
in
vain
did
he
toil
over
it
and
perspire
an
hour
through
the
confounded
apparatus
would
not
come
unfolded
there
are
some
umbrellas
which
amuse
themselves
under
torrential
rains
with
just
such
tricks
upon
you
fairly
tired
out
with
the
struggle
the
victim
dashed
down
the
machine
and
lay
upon
it
swearing
like
the
regular
southron
he
was
tar
tar
rar
tar
tar
rar

what
on
earth
s
that
wondered
tartarin
suddenly
aroused
it
was
the
bugles
of
the
chasseurs
d
afrique
sounding
the
in
the
mustapha
barracks
the
stupefied
rubbed
his
eyes
for
he
had
believed
himself
out
in
the
boundless
wilderness
and
do
you
know
where
he
really
was
in
a
field
of
artichokes
between
a
and
a
patch
of
beets
his
sahara
grew
kitchen
vegetables
close
to
him
on
the
pretty
verdant
slope
of
upper
mustapha
the
snowy
villas
glowed
in
the
rosy
rising
sun
anybody
would
believe
himself
in
the
neighbourhood
of
marseilles
amongst
its
bastides
and
bastidons
the
commonplace
and
aspect
of
this
country
much
astonished
the
poor
man
and
put
him
in
bad
humour
these
folk
are
crazy
he
reasoned
to
plant
artichokes
in
the
of
lions
for
in
short
i
have
not
been
dreaming
lions
have
come
here
and
there
s
the
what
he
called
the
proof
was
left
behind
the
beast
in
its
flight
bending
over
this
ruddy
trail
with
his
eye
on
the
lookout
and
his
revolver
in
his
fist
the
valiant
tarasconian
went
from
artichoke
to
artichoke
up
to
a
little
field
of
oats
in
the
trampled
grass
was
a
pool
of
blood
and
in
the
midst
of
the
pool
lying
on
its
flank
with
a
large
wound
in
the
head
was
a
guess
what
a
lion
of
course
not
a
bit
of
it
an
ass
one
of
those
little
donkeys
so
common
in
algeria
where
they
are
called
bourriquots
vi
arrival
of
the
female
a
terrible
combat
game
fellows
meet
here
looking
on
his
hapless
victim
tartarin
s
first
impulse
was
one
of
vexation
there
is
such
a
wide
gap
between
a
lion
and
poor
jack
his
second
feeling
was
one
of
pity
the
poor
bourriquot
was
so
pretty
and
looked
so
kindly
the
hide
on
his
still
warm
sides
heaved
and
fell
like
waves
tartarin
knelt
down
and
strove
with
the
end
of
his
algerian
sash
to
stanch
the
blood
and
all
you
can
imagine
in
the
way
of
touchingness
was
offered
by
the
picture
of
this
great
man
tending
this
little
ass
at
the
touch
of
the
silky
cloth
the
donkey
who
had
not
twopennyworth
of
life
in
him
opened
his
large
grey
eye
and
winked
his
long
ears
two
or
three
times
as
much
as
to
say
oh
thank
you
before
a
final
spasm
shook
it
from
head
to
tail
whereafter
it
stirred
no
more
noiraud
blackey
suddenly
screamed
a
voice
choking
with
anguish
as
the
branches
in
a
thicket
hard
by
moved
at
the
same
time
tartarin
had
no
more
than
enough
time
to
rise
and
stand
upon
guard
this
was
the
female
she
rushed
up
fearsome
and
roaring
under
form
of
an
old
alsatian
woman
her
hair
in
a
kerchief
armed
with
large
red
umbrella
and
calling
for
her
ass
till
all
the
echoes
of
mustapha
rang
it
certainly
would
have
been
better
for
tartarin
to
have
had
to
deal
with
a
lioness
in
fury
than
this
old
virago
in
vain
did
the
luckless
sportsman
try
to
make
her
understand
how
the
blunder
had
occurred
and
he
had
mistaken
noiraud
for
a
lion
the
harridan
believed
he
was
making
fun
of
her
and
uttering
energetical
der
teufels
fell
upon
our
hero
to
bang
him
with
the
gingham
a
little
bewildered
tartarin
defended
himself
as
best
he
could
warding
off
the
blows
with
his
rifle
streaming
with
perspiration
panting
jumping
about
and
crying
out
but
madame
but
much
good
his
buts
were
madame
was
dull
of
hearing
and
her
blows
continued
hard
as
ever
fortunately
a
third
party
arrived
on
the
battlefield
the
alsatian
s
husband
of
the
same
race
a
roadside
innkeeper
as
well
as
a
very
good
which
was
better
when
he
saw
what
kind
of
a
customer
he
had
to
deal
with
a
slaughterer
who
only
wanted
to
pay
the
value
of
his
victim
he
disarmed
his
and
they
came
to
an
understanding
tartarin
gave
two
hundred
francs
the
donkey
being
worth
about
ten
at
least
that
is
the
current
price
in
the
arab
markets
then
poor
blackey
was
laid
to
rest
at
the
root
of
a
and
the
alsatian
raised
to
joviality
by
the
colour
of
the
tarascon
ducats
invited
the
hero
to
have
a
quencher
with
him
in
his
which
stood
only
a
few
steps
off
on
the
edge
of
the
highway
every
sunday
the
sportsmen
from
the
city
came
there
to
regale
of
a
morning
for
the
plain
abounded
with
game
and
there
was
no
better
place
for
rabbits
for
two
leagues
around
how
about
lions
inquired
tartarin
the
alsatian
stared
at
him
greatly
astounded
lions
yes
lions
don
t
you
see
them
sometimes
resumed
the
poor
fellow
with
less
confidence
the
boniface
burst
out
in
laughter
ho
ho
bless
us
lions
what
would
we
do
with
lions
here
are
there
then
none
in
algeria
pon
my
faith
i
never
saw
any
albeit
i
have
been
twenty
years
in
the
colony
still
i
believe
i
have
heard
tell
of
such
a
thing
leastwise
i
fancy
the
newspapers
said
but
that
is
ever
so
much
farther
inland
down
south
you
know
at
this
point
they
reached
the
hostelry
a
suburban
pothouse
with
a
withered
green
bough
over
the
door
crossed
painted
on
the
wall
and
this
harmless
sign
over
a
picture
of
wild
rabbits
feeding
game
fellows
meet
game
fellows
it
made
tartarin
think
of
captain
bravida
vii
about
an
omnibus
a
moorish
beauty
and
a
wreath
of
jessamine
common
people
would
have
been
discouraged
by
such
a
first
adventure
but
men
of
tartarin
s
mettle
do
not
easily
get
cast
down
the
lions
are
in
the
south
are
they
mused
the
hero
very
well
then
south
i
as
soon
as
he
had
swallowed
his
last
mouthful
he
jumped
up
thanked
his
host
nodded
to
the
old
hag
without
any
dropped
a
final
tear
over
the
hapless
blackey
and
quickly
returned
to
algiers
with
the
firm
intention
of
packing
up
and
starting
that
very
day
for
the
south
the
mustapha
highroad
seemed
unfortunately
to
have
stretched
since
overnight
and
what
a
sun
and
dust
there
were
and
what
a
weight
in
that
tartarin
did
not
feel
to
have
the
courage
to
walk
to
the
town
and
he
beckoned
to
the
first
omnibus
coming
along
and
climbed
in
oh
our
poor
tartarin
of
tarascon
how
much
better
it
would
have
been
for
his
name
and
fame
not
to
have
stepped
into
that
fatal
ark
on
wheels
but
to
have
continued
on
his
road
afoot
at
the
risk
of
falling
suffocated
beneath
the
burden
of
the
atmosphere
the
tent
and
his
heavy
rifles
when
tartarin
got
in
the
bus
was
full
at
the
end
with
his
nose
in
his
sat
a
large
and
vicar
from
town
facing
him
was
a
young
moorish
merchant
smoking
coarse
cigarettes
and
a
maltese
sailor
and
four
or
five
moorish
women
muffled
up
in
white
cloths
so
that
only
their
eyes
could
be
spied
these
ladies
had
been
to
offer
up
prayers
in
the
abdel
kader
cemetery
but
this
funereal
visit
did
not
seem
to
have
much
saddened
them
for
they
could
be
heard
chuckling
and
chattering
between
themselves
under
their
coverings
whilst
munching
pastry
tartarin
fancied
that
they
watched
him
narrowly
one
in
particular
seated
over
against
him
had
fixed
her
eyes
upon
his
and
never
took
them
off
all
the
drive
although
the
dame
was
veiled
the
liveliness
of
the
big
black
eyes
lengthened
out
by
k
hol
a
delightfully
slender
wrist
loaded
with
gold
bracelets
of
which
a
glimpse
was
given
from
time
to
time
among
the
folds
the
sound
of
her
voice
the
graceful
almost
childlike
movements
of
the
head
all
revealed
that
a
young
pretty
and
loveable
creature
bloomed
underneath
the
veil
the
unfortunate
tartarin
did
not
know
where
to
shrink
the
fond
mute
gaze
of
these
splendrous
oriental
orbs
agitated
him
perturbed
him
and
made
him
feel
like
dying
with
flushes
of
heat
and
fits
of
cold
shivers
to
finish
him
the
lady
s
slipper
meddled
in
the
onslaught
he
felt
the
dainty
thing
wander
and
frisk
about
over
his
heavy
hunting
boots
like
a
tiny
red
mouse
what
could
he
do
answer
the
glance
and
the
pressure
of
course
ay
but
what
about
the
consequences
a
loving
intrigue
in
the
east
is
a
terrible
matter
with
his
romantic
southern
nature
the
honest
tarasconian
saw
himself
already
falling
into
the
grip
of
the
eunuchs
to
be
decapitated
or
better
we
mean
worse
than
that
sewn
up
in
a
leather
sack
and
sunk
in
the
sea
with
his
head
under
his
arm
beside
him
this
somewhat
cooled
him
in
the
meantime
the
little
slipper
continued
its
proceedings
and
the
eyes
widely
open
opposite
him
like
twin
black
velvet
flowers

to
say

was
the
last
to

in

her
countenance
skimmed
so
closely
to

that
her
breath
enveloped
him
a
veritable
nosegay
of
youth
and
freshness
with
an
indescribable
of
musk
jessamine
and
pastry
the
tarasconian
stood
out
no
longer
intoxicated
with
love
and
ready
for
anything
he
darted
out
after
the
beauty
at
the
rumpling
sound
of

turned

a

on
her
veiled
mouth
as
one
who
would
say
hush
and
with
the
other
hand
quickly
tossed
him
a
little
wreath
of
jessamine
flowers
tartarin
of
tarascon
stooped
to
pick
it
up
but
as
he
was
rather
clumsy
and
much
overburdened
with
implements
of

the
operation
took
rather
long
when
he
did
straighten
up

whose

smoked

between

mumbled
in
undertones
as
if
hatching
wicked
attacks
to
say
that
tartarin
traversed
this
grisly
place
without
any
emotion
would
be
putting
forth
falsehood
on
the
contrary
he
was
much
affected
and
the
stout
fellow
only
went
up
the
obscure
lanes
where
his
corporation
took
up
all
the
width
with
the
utmost
precaution
his
eye
skinned
and
his
finger
on
his
revolver
trigger
in
the
same
manner
as
he
went
to
the

at

at
any
moment
he
expected
to
have
a
whole
gang
of
eunuchs
and
janissaries
drop
upon
his
back
yet
the
longing
to
behold
that
dark
damsel
again
gave
him
a
giant
s
strength
and
boldness
for
a
full
week
the
undaunted
tartarin
never
quitted
the
high
town
yes
for
all
that
period
he
might
have
been
seen
cooling
his
heels
before

turkish
awaiting
the
hour
when

came
forth
in
troops
shivering
and
still
redolent
of
soap
and
hot
water

squatting
at
the
doorways

puffing
and
melting
in

get
out

to
enter

was
returning
at

having
discovered
anything
at

our
man
from
tarascon
in

mansions
would
hear
monotonous
songs
smothered
twanging
of
guitars
thumping
of
tambourines
and
feminine
which
would
make
his
heart
beat
haply
she
is
there
he
would
say
to
himself
thereupon
granting
the
street
was
unpeopled
he
would
go
up
to
one
of
these
dwellings
lift
the
heavy
knocker
of
the
low
postern
and
timidly
rap
the
songs
and

it
was
into
the
thick
of
this
saturnalia
that
the
great
tartarin
came
straying
one
evening
to
find
oblivion
and
heart
s
ease
he
was
roving
alone
through
the
gathering
brooding
about
his
moorish
beauty
when
two
angered
voices
arose
suddenly
from
a
above
all
the
clamour
and
chink
of
coin
i
tell
you
m
sieu
that
i
am
twenty
francs
short
stuff
m
sieu
stuff
yourself
m
sieu
you
shall
learn
whom
you
are
addressing
m
sieu
i
am
dying
to
do
that
m
sieu
i
am
prince
gregory
of
montenegro
m
upon
this
title
tartarin
much
excited
cleft
the
throng
and
placed
himself
in
the
foremost
rank
proud
and
happy
to
find
his
prince
again
the
montenegrin
noble
of
such
politeness
whose
acquaintance
he
had
begun
on
board
of
the
mail
steamer
unfortunately
the
title
of
highness
which
had
so
dazzled
the
worthy
tarasconian
did
not
produce
the
slightest
impression
upon
the
chasseurs
officer
with
whom
the
noble
had
his
dispute
i
am
much
the
wiser
observed
the
military
gentleman
sneeringly
and
turning
to
the
bystanders
he
added
prince
gregory
of
montenegro
who
knows
any
such
a
person
nobody
the
indignant
tartarin
took
one
step
forward
allow
me
i
know
the
prince
said
he
in
a
very
firm
voice
and
with
his
finest
tarasconian
accent
the
light
cavalry
officer
eyed
him
hard
for
a
moment
and
then
shrugging
his
shoulders
returned
come
that
is
good
just
you
two
share
the
twenty
francs
lacking
between
you
and
let
us
talk
no
more
on
the
whereupon
he
turned
his
back
upon
them
and
mixed
with
the
crowd
the
stormy
tartarin
was
going
to
rush
after
him
but
the
prince
prevented
that
let
him
go
i
can
manage
my
own
taking
the
interventionist
by
the
arm
he
drew
him
rapidly
out
of
doors
when
they
were
upon
the
square
prince
gregory
of
montenegro
lifted
his
hat
off
extended
his
hand
to
our
hero
and
as
he
but
dimly
remembered
his
name
he
began
in
a
vibrating
voice
monsieur
barbarin
tartarin
prompted
the
other
timidly
tartarin
barbarin
no
matter
between
us
henceforward
it
is
a
league
of
life
and
death
the
montenegrin
noble
shook
his
hand
with
fierce
energy
you
may
infer
that
the
tarasconian
was
proud
prince
prince
he
repeated
enthusiastically
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
subsequently
the
two
gentlemen
were
installed
in
the
platanes
restaurant
an
agreeable
late
with
terraces
running
out
over
the
sea
where
before
a
hearty
russian
salad
seconded
by
a
nice
crescia
wine
they
renewed
the
friendship
you
can
not
image
any
one
more
bewitching
than
this
montenegrin
prince
slender
fine
with
crisp
hair
curled
by
the
tongs
shaved
a
week
under
and
on
that
bestarred
with
decorations
he
had
the
wily
eye
the
fondling
gestures
and
vaguely
the
accent
of
an
italian
which
gave
him
an
air
of
cardinal
mazarin
without
his
and
moustaches
he
was
deeply
versed
in
the
latin
tongues
and
lugged
in
quotations
from
tacitus
horace
and
caesar
s
commentaries
at
every
opening
of
an
old
noble
strain
it
appeared
that
his
brothers
had
had
him
exiled
at
the
age
of
ten
on
account
of
his
liberal
opinions
since
which
time
he
had
roamed
the
world
for
pleasure
and
instruction
as
a
philosophical
noble
a
singular
coincidence
the
prince
had
spent
three
years
in
tarascon
and
as
tartarin
showed
amazement
at
never
having
met
him
at
the
club
or
on
the
esplanade
his
highness
evasively
remarked
that
he
never
went
about
through
delicacy
the
tarasconian
did
not
dare
to
question
further
all
great
existences
have
such
mysterious
nooks
to
sum
up
this
signor
gregory
was
a
very
genial
aristocrat
whilst
sipping
the
rosy
crescia
juice
he
patiently
listened
to
tartarin
s
expatiating
on
his
lovely
moor
and
he
even
promised
to
find
her
speedily
as
he
had
full
knowledge
of
the
native
ladies
they
drank
hard
and
lengthily
in
toasts
to
the
ladies
of
algiers
and
the
freedom
of
montenegro
outside
upon
the
terrace
heaved
the
sea
and
its
rollers
slapped
the
strand
in
the
darkness
with
much
the
sound
of
wet
sails
flapping
the
air
was
warm
and
the
sky
full
of
stars
in
the
a
nightingale
was
piping
it
was
tartarin
who
paid
the
piper
x
tell
me
your
father
s
name
and
i
will
tell
you
the
name
of
that
princes
of
montenegro
are
the
ones
to
find
the
on
the
morrow
early
after
this
evening
at
the
platanes
prince
gregory
was
in
the
tarasconian
s
bedroom
quick
dress
yourself
quickly
your
moorish
beauty
is
found
her
name
is
baya
she
s
scarce
twenty
as
pretty
as
a
love
and
already
a
a
widow
what
a
slice
of
luck
joyfully
exclaimed
tartarin
who
dreaded
oriental
husbands
ay
but
woefully
closely
guarded
by
her
oh
the
mischief
a
savage
chap
who
vends
pipes
in
the
orleans
here
fell
a
silence
a
fig
for
that
proceeded
the
prince
you
are
not
the
man
to
be
daunted
by
such
a
trifle
and
anyhow
this
old
corsair
can
be
pacified
i
daresay
by
having
some
pipes
bought
of
him
but
be
quick
on
with
your
courting
suit
you
lucky
dog
pale
and
agitated
with
his
heart
brimming
over
with
love
the
tarasconian
leaped
out
of
his
couch
and
as
he
hastily
buttoned
up
his
capacious
nether
garment
wanted
to
know
how
he
should
act
write
straightway
to
the
lady
and
ask
for
a
do
you
mean
to
say
she
knows
french
queried
the
tarasconian
simpleton
with
the
disappointed
mien
of
one
who
had
believed
thoroughly
in
the
orient
not
one
word
of
it
rejoined
the
prince
imperturbably
but
you
can
dictate
the
and
i
will
translate
it
bit
by
o
prince
how
kind
you
are
the
lover
began
striding
up
and
down
the
bedroom
in
silent
meditation
naturally
a
man
does
not
write
to
a
moorish
girl
in
algiers
in
the
same
way
as
to
a
seamstress
of
beaucaire
it
was
a
very
lucky
thing
that
our
hero
had
in
mind
his
numerous
readings
which
allowed
him
by
amalgamating
the
red
indian
eloquence
of
gustave
aimard
s
apaches
with
lamartine
s
rhetorical
flourishes
in
the
voyage
en
orient
and
some
reminiscences
of
the
song
of
songs
to
compose
the
most
eastern
letter
that
you
could
expect
to
see
it
opened
with
like
unto
the
ostrich
upon
the
sandy
waste
and
concluded
by
tell
me
your
father
s
name
and
i
will
tell
you
the
name
of
that
to
this
missive
the
romantic
tartarin
would
have
much
liked
to
join
an
emblematic
bouquet
of
flowers
in
the
eastern
fashion
but
prince
gregory
thought
it
better
to
purchase
some
pipes
at
the
brother
s
which
could
not
fail
to
soften
his
wild
temper
and
would
certainly
please
the
lady
a
very
great
deal
as
she
was
much
of
a
smoker
let
s
be
off
at
once
to
buy
them
said
tartarin
full
of
ardour
no
no
let
me
go
alone
i
can
get
them
eh
what
would
you
save
me
the
trouble
o
prince
prince
you
do
me
proud
quite
abashed
the
fellow
offered
his
purse
to
the
obliging
montenegrin
urging
him
to
overlook
nothing
by
which
the
lady
would
be
gratified
unfortunately
the
suit
albeit
capitally
commenced
did
not
progress
as
rapidly
as
might
have
been
anticipated
it
appeared
that
the
moorish
beauty
was
very
deeply
affected
by
tartarin
s
eloquence
and
for
that
matter
won
beforehand
so
that
she
wished
nothing
better
than
to
receive
him
but
that
brother
of
hers
had
qualms
and
to
lull
them
it
was
necessary
to
buy
pipes
by
the
dozens
nay
the
gross
well
we
had
best
say
by
the
shipload
at
once
what
the
plague
can
baya
do
with
all
these
pipes
poor
tartarin
wanted
to
know
more
than
once
but
he
paid
the
bills
all
the
same
and
without
niggardliness
at
length
after
having
purchased
a
mountainous
stack
of
pipes
and
poured
forth
lakes
of
oriental
poesy
an
interview
was
arranged
i
have
no
need
to
tell
you
with
what
throbbings
of
the
heart
the
tarasconian
prepared
himself
with
what
carefulness
he
trimmed
brilliantined
and
perfumed
his
rough
s
beard
and
how
he
did
not
forget
for
everything
must
be
thought
of
to
slip
a
spiky
and
two
or
three
into
his
pockets
the
prince
was
coming
to
this
first
meeting
in
the
office
of
interpreter
the
lady
dwelt
in
the
upper
part
of
the
town
before
her
doorway
a
boy
moor
of
fourteen
or
less
was
smoking
cigarettes
this
was
the
brother
in
question
the
celebrated
ali
on
seeing
the
pair
of
visitors
arrive
he
gave
a
double
knock
on
the
postern
gate
and
delicately
glided
away
the
door
opened
a
negress
appeared
who
conducted
the
gentlemen
without
uttering
a
word
across
the
narrow
inner
courtyard
into
a
small
cool
room
where
the
lady
awaited
them
reclining
on
a
low
ottoman
at
first
glance
she
appeared
smaller
and
stouter
than
the
moorish
damsel
met
in
the
omnibus
by
the
tarasconian
in
fact
was
it
really
the
same
but
the
doubt
merely
flashed
through
tartarin
s
brain
like
a
stroke
of
lightning
the
dame
was
so
pretty
thus
with
her
feet
bare
and
plump
fingers
fine
and
pink
loaded
with
rings
under
her
bodice
of
gilded
cloth
and
the
folds
of
her
dress
was
suggested
a
lovable
creature
rather
blessed
materially
rounded
everywhere
and
nice
enough
to
eat
the
amber
mouthpiece
of
a
narghileh
smoked
at
her
lips
and
enveloped
her
wholly
in
a
halo
of
smoke
on
entering
the
tarasconian
laid
a
hand
on
his
heart
and
bowed
as
moorlike
as
possible
whilst
rolling
his
large
impassioned
eyes
baya
gazed
on
him
for
a
moment
without
making
any
answer
but
then
dropping
her
she
threw
her
head
back
hid
it
in
her
hands
and
they
could
only
see
her
white
neck
rippling
with
a
wild
laugh
like
a
bag
full
of
pearls
xi
sidi
tart
ri
ben
tart
ri
should
you
ever
drop
into
the
of
the
algerian
upper
town
after
dark
even
at
this
day
you
would
still
hear
the
natives
chatting
among
themselves
with
many
a
wink
and
slight
laugh
of
one
sidi
tart
ri
ben
tart
ri
a
rich
and
european
who
dwelt
a
few
years
back
in
that
neighbourhood
with
a
buxom
witch
of
local
origin
named
baya
this
sidi
tart
ri
who
has
left
such
a
merry
memory
around
the
kasbah
is
no
other
than
our
tartarin
as
will
be
guessed
how
could
you
expect
things
otherwise
in
the
lives
of
heroes
of
saints
too
it
happens
the
same
way
there
are
moments
of
blindness
perturbation
and
weakness
the
illustrious
tarasconian
was
no
more
exempt
from
this
than
another
and
that
is
the
reason
during
two
months
that
oblivious
of
fame
and
lions
he
revelled
in
oriental
amorousness
and
dozed
like
hannibal
at
capua
in
the
delights
of
algiers
the
white
the
good
fellow
took
a
pretty
little
house
in
the
native
style
in
the
heart
of
the
arab
town
with
inner
courtyard
cool
verandahs
and
fountains
he
dwelt
afar
from
noise
in
company
with
the
moorish
charmer
a
thorough
woman
to
the
manner
born
who
pulled
at
her
all
day
when
she
was
not
eating
stretched
out
on
a
divan
in
front
of
him
baya
would
drone
him
monotonous
tunes
with
a
guitar
in
her
fist
or
else
to
distract
her
lord
and
master
favour
him
with
the
bee
dance
holding
a
up
in
which
she
reflected
her
white
teeth
and
the
faces
she
made
as
the
esmeralda
did
not
know
a
word
of
french
and
tartarin
none
in
arabic
the
conversation
died
away
sometimes
and
the
tarasconian
had
plenty
of
leisure
to
do
penance
for
the
gush
of
language
of
which
he
had
been
guilty
in
the
shop
of
bezuquet
the
chemist
or
that
of
costecalde
the
gunmaker
but
this
penance
was
not
devoid
of
charm
for
he
felt
a
kind
of
enjoyable
sullenness
in
dawdling
away
the
whole
day
without
speaking
and
in
listening
to
the
gurgling
of
the
hookah
the
strumming
of
the
guitar
and
the
faint
splashing
of
the
fountain
on
the
mosaic
pavement
of
the
yard
the
pipe
the
bath
and
caresses
filled
his
entire
life
they
seldom
went
out
of
doors
sometimes
with
his
upon
a
pillion
sidi
tart
ri
would
ride
upon
a
sturdy
mule
to
eat
pomegranates
in
a
little
garden
he
had
purchased
in
the
suburbs
but
never
without
exception
did
he
go
down
into
the
european
quarter
this
kind
of
algiers
appeared
to
him
as
ugly
and
unbearable
as
a
barracks
at
home
with
its
zouaves
in
revelry
its
crammed
with
officers
and
its
everlasting
clank
of
metal
under
the
arcades
the
sum
total
is
that
our
tarasconian
was
very
happy
particularly
being
very
sweet
upon
turkish
pastry
declared
that
one
could
not
be
more
satisfied
than
by
this
new
existence
had
some
twinges
at
whiles
on
thinking
of
tarascon
and
the
promises
of
but
this
remorse
did
not
last
and
to
drive
away
such
dampening
ideas
there
sufficed
one
glance
from
baya
or
a
spoonful
of
those
diabolical
dizzying
and
odoriferous
sweetmeats
like
circe
s
brews
in
the
evening
gregory
came
to
discourse
a
little
about
a
free
black
mountain
of
indefatigable
obligingness
this
amiable
nobleman
filled
the
functions
of
an
interpreter
in
the
household
or
those
of
a
steward
at
a
pinch
and
all
for
nothing
for
the
sheer
pleasure
of
it
apart
from
him
tartarin
received
none
but
all
those
pirates
who
had
given
him
such
frights
from
the
backs
of
their
black
stalls
turned
out
when
once
he
made
their
acquaintance
to
be
good
inoffensive
tradesmen
embroiderers
dealers
in
spice
turners
fellows
humble
clever
close
and
hands
at
homely
card
games
four
or
five
times
a
week
these
gentry
would
come
and
spend
the
evening
at
sidi
tart
ri
s
winning
his
small
change
eating
his
cakes
and
dainties
and
delicately
retiring
on
the
stroke
of
ten
with
thanks
to
the
prophet
left
alone
sidi
tart
ri
and
his
faithful
spouse
by
the
broomstick
wedding
would
finish
the
evening
on
their
terrace
a
broad
white
roof
which
overlooked
the
city
all
around
them
a
thousand
of
other
such
white
flats
placid
beneath
the
moonshine
were
descending
like
steps
to
the
sea
the
breeze
carried
up
tinkling
of
guitars
suddenly
like
a
shower
of
firework
stars
a
full
clear
melody
would
be
softly
sprinkled
out
from
the
sky
and
on
the
minaret
of
the
neighbouring
mosque
a
handsome
muezzin
would
appear
his
blanched
form
outlined
on
the
deep
blue
of
the
night
as
he
chanted
the
glory
of
allah
with
a
marvellous
voice
which
filled
the
horizon
thereupon
baya
would
let
go
her
guitar
and
with
her
large
eyes
turned
towards
the
crier
seem
to
imbibe
the
prayer
deliciously
as
long
as
the
chant
endured
she
would
remain
thrilled
there
in
ecstasy
like
an
oriental
saint
the
deeply
impressed
tartarin
would
watch
her
pray
and
conclude
that
it
must
be
a
splendid
and
powerful
creed
that
could
cause
such
frenzies
of
faith
tarascon
veil
thy
face
here
is
a
son
of
thine
on
the
point
of
becoming
a
renegade
xii
the
latest
intelligence
from
tarascon
parting
from
his
little
country
seat
sidi
tart
ri
was
returning
alone
on
his
mule
on
a
fine
afternoon
when
the
sky
was
blue
and
the
zephyrs
warm
his
legs
were
kept
wide
apart
by
ample
of
esparto
cloth
swelled
out
with
cedrats
and
lulled
by
the
ring
of
his
large
stirrups
and
rocking
his
body
to
the
swing
and
swaying
of
the
beast
the
good
fellow
was
thus
traversing
an
adorable
country
with
his
hands
folded
on
his
paunch
gone
through
heat
in
a
comfortable
doze
all
at
once
on
entering
the
town
a
deafening
appeal
aroused
him
ahoy
what
a
monster
fate
is
anybody
d
take
this
for
monsieur
on
this
name
and
at
the
jolly
southern
accent
the
tarasconian
lifted
his
head
and
perceived
a
couple
of
steps
away
the
honest
tanned
visage
of
captain
barbassou
master
of
the
zouave
who
was
taking
his
absinthe
at
the
door
of
a
little
hey
lord
love
you
barbassou
said
tartarin
pulling
up
his
mule
instead
of
continuing
the
dialogue
barbassou
stared
at
him
for
a
space
ere
he
burst
into
a
peal
of
such
hilarity
that
sidi
tart
ri
sat
back
dumbfounded
on
his
melons
what
a
stunning
turban
my
poor
monsieur
tartarin
is
it
true
what
they
say
of
your
having
turned
turk
how
is
little
baya
is
she
still
singing
marco
la
bella
marco
la
bella
repeated
the
indignant
tartarin
i
ll
have
you
to
know
captain
that
the
person
you
mention
is
an
honourable
moorish
lady
and
one
who
does
not
know
a
word
of
baya
does
not
know
french
what
lunatic
asylum
do
you
hail
from
then
the
good
captain
broke
into
still
heartier
laughter
but
seeing
the
chops
of
poor
sidi
tart
ri
fall
he
changed
his
course
howsoever
may
happen
it
is
not
the
same
lass
let
s
reckon
that
i
have
mixed
em
up
still
mark
you
monsieur
tartarin
you
will
do
well
nonetheless
to
distrust
algerian
moors
and
montenegrin
tartarin
rose
in
the
stirrups
making
a
wry
face
the
prince
is
my
friend
come
come
don
t
wax
wrathy
won
t
you
have
some
bitters
to
sweeten
you
no
haven
t
you
anything
to
say
to
the
folks
at
home
neither
well
then
a
pleasant
journey
by
the
way
mate
i
have
some
good
french
bacco
upon
me
and
if
you
would
like
to
carry
away
a
few
pipefuls
you
have
only
to
take
some
take
it
won
t
you
it
s
your
beastly
oriental
baccoes
that
have
befogged
your
upon
this
the
captain
went
back
to
his
absinthe
whilst
the
moody
tartarin
trotted
slowly
on
the
road
to
his
little
house
although
his
great
soul
refused
to
credit
anything
barbassou
s
insinuations
had
vexed
him
and
the
familiar
adjurations
and
home
accent
had
awakened
vague
remorse
he
found
nobody
at
home
baya
having
gone
out
to
the
bath
the
negress
appeared
sinister
and
the
dwelling
saddening
a
prey
to
inexpressible
melancholy
he
went
and
sat
down
by
the
fountain
to
load
a
pipe
with
barbassou
s
tobacco
it
was
wrapped
up
in
a
piece
of
the
marseilles
semaphore
newspaper
on
flattening
it
out
the
name
of
his
native
place
struck
his
eyes
our
tarascon
correspondent
writes
the
city
is
in
distress
there
has
been
no
news
for
several
months
from
tartarin
the
who
set
off
to
hunt
the
great
feline
tribe
in
africa
what
can
have
become
of
our
heroic
those
hardly
dare
ask
who
know
as
we
do
how
he
was
and
what
boldness
and
thirst
for
adventures
were
his
has
he
like
many
others
been
smothered
in
the
sands
or
has
he
fallen
under
the
murderous
fangs
of
one
of
those
monsters
of
the
atlas
range
of
which
he
had
promised
the
skins
to
the
municipality
what
a
dreadful
state
of
uncertainty
it
is
true
some
negro
traders
come
to
beaucaire
fair
assert
having
met
in
the
middle
of
the
deserts
a
european
whose
description
agreed
with
his
he
was
proceeding
towards
timbuctoo
may
heaven
preserve
our
tartarin
when
he
read
this
the
son
of
tarascon
reddened
blanched
and
shuddered
all
tarascon
appeared
unto
him
the
club
the
costecalde
s
green
and
hovering
over
all
like
a
spread
eagle
the
imposing
moustaches
of
brave
commandant
bravida
at
seeing
himself
here
as
he
was
cowardly
lolling
on
a
mat
whilst
his
friends
believed
him
slaughtering
wild
beasts
tartarin
of
tarascon
was
ashamed
of
himself
and
could
have
wept
had
he
not
been
a
hero
suddenly
he
leaped
up
and
thundered
the
lion
the
lion
down
with
him
and
dashing
into
the
dusty
where
mouldered
the
the
the
potted
meats
and
the
he
dragged
them
out
into
the
middle
of
the
court
was
no
more
occupied
the
field
of
active
life
only
the
time
to
inspect
his
armament
and
stores
don
his
harness
get
into
his
heavy
boots
scribble
a
couple
of
words
to
confide
baya
to
the
prince
and
slip
a
few
sprinkled
with
tears
into
the
envelope
and
then
the
dauntless
tarasconian
rolled
away
in
the
on
the
blidah
road
leaving
the
house
to
the
negress
before
the
pipe
the
turban
and
babooshes
all
the
moslem
shell
of
sidi
tart
ri
which
sprawled
piteously
under
the
little
white
trefoils
of
the
gallery
episode
the
third
among
the
lions
i
what
becomes
of
the
old
come
to
look
closely
at
the
vehicle
it
was
an
old
all
of
the
olden
time
upholstered
in
faded
deep
blue
cloth
with
those
enormous
rough
woollen
balls
which
after
a
few
hours
journey
finally
establish
a
raw
spot
in
the
small
of
your
back
tartarin
of
tarascon
had
a
corner
of
the
inside
where
he
installed
himself
most
and
preliminarily
to
inspiring
the
rank
emanations
of
the
great
african
felines
the
hero
had
to
content
himself
with
that
homely
old
odour
of
the
oddly
composed
of
a
thousand
smells
of
man
and
woman
horses
and
harness
eatables
and
mildewed
straw
there
was
a
little
of
everything
inside
a
trappist
monk
some
jew
merchants
two
fast
ladies
going
to
join
their
regiment
the
third
hussars
a
photographic
artist
from
orleansville
and
so
on
but
however
charming
and
varied
was
the
company
the
tarasconian
was
not
in
the
mood
for
chatting
he
remained
quite
thoughtful
with
an
arm
in
the
and
his
guns
between
his
knees
all
churned
up
his
wits
the
precipitate
departure
baya
s
eyes
of
jet
the
terrible
chase
he
was
about
to
undertake
to
say
nothing
of
this
european
coach
with
its
noah
s
ark
aspect
rediscovered
in
the
heart
of
africa
vaguely
recalling
the
tarascon
of
his
youth
with
its
races
in
the
suburbs
jolly
dinners
on
the
a
throng
of
memories
in
short
gradually
night
came
on
the
guard
lit
up
the
lamps
the
rusty
diligence
danced
creakingly
on
its
old
springs
the
horses
trotted
and
their
bells
jangled
from
time
to
time
in
the
boot
arose
a
dreadful
clank
of
iron
that
was
the
war
material
tartarin
of
tarascon
nearly
overcome
dwelt
a
moment
scanning
the
comically
shaken
by
the
jolts
and
dancing
before
him
like
the
shadows
in
till
his
eyes
grew
cloudy
and
his
mind
befogged
and
only
vaguely
he
heard
the
wheels
grind
and
the
sides
of
the
conveyance
squeak
complainingly
suddenly
a
voice
called
tartarin
by
his
name
the
voice
of
an
old
fairy
godmother
hoarse
broken
and
cracked
monsieur
tartarin
three
times
who
s
calling
me
it
s
i
monsieur
tartarin
don
t
you
recognise
me
i
am
the
old
who
used
to
do
the
road
betwixt
nimes
and
tarascon
twenty
year
agone
how
many
times
i
have
carried
you
and
your
friends
when
you
went
to
shoot
at
caps
over
joncquieres
or
bellegarde
way
i
did
not
know
you
again
at
the
first
on
account
of
your
turk
s
cap
and
the
flesh
you
have
accumulated
but
as
soon
as
you
began
snoring
what
a
rascal
is
i
twigged
you
straight
all
right
that
s
all
right
enough
observed
the
tarasconian
a
shade
vexed
but
softening
he
added
but
to
the
point
my
poor
old
girl
whatever
did
you
come
out
here
for
pooh
my
good
monsieur
tartarin
i
assure
you
i
never
came
of
my
own
free
will
as
soon
as
the
beaucaire
railway
was
finished
i
was
considered
good
for
nought
and
shipped
away
into
algeria
and
i
am
not
the
only
one
either
bless
you
next
to
all
the
old
of
france
have
been
packed
off
like
me
we
were
regarded
as
too
much
the
conservative
the
d
ye
see
and
now
we
are
here
leading
the
life
of
a
dog
this
is
what
you
in
france
call
the
algerian
here
the
ancient
vehicle
heaved
a
sigh
before
proceeding
my
wheels
and
linchpin
monsieur
tartarin
how
i
regret
my
lovely
tarascon
that
was
the
good
time
for
me
when
i
was
young
you
ought
to
have
seen
me
starting
off
in
the
morning
washed
with
no
stint
of
water
and
all
with
my
wheels
freshly
varnished
my
lamps
blazing
like
a
brace
of
suns
and
my
boot
always
rubbed
up
with
oil
it
was
indeed
lovely
when
the
postillion
cracked
his
whip
to
the
tune
of
lagadigadeou
the
tarasque
the
tarasque
and
the
guard
his
horn
in
its
sling
and
laced
cap
cocked
well
over
one
ear
chucking
his
little
dog
always
in
a
fury
upon
the
top
climbed
up
himself
with
a
shout
then
would
my
four
horses
dash
off
to
the
medley
of
bells
barks
and
and
the
windows
fly
open
for
all
tarascon
to
look
with
pride
upon
the
royal
mail
coach
dart
over
the
king
s
highway
what
a
splendid
road
that
was
monsieur
tartarin
broad
and
well
kept
with
its
its
little
heaps
of
at
regular
distances
and
its
pretty
clumps
of
vines
and
on
either
hand
then
again
the
roadside
inns
so
close
together
and
the
changes
of
horses
every
five
minutes
and
what
jolly
honest
chaps
my
patrons
were
village
mayors
and
parish
priests
going
up
to
nimes
to
see
their
prefect
or
bishop
returning
openly
from
the
mazet
collegians
out
on
holiday
leave
peasants
in
worked
all
fresh
shaven
for
the
occasion
that
morning
and
up
above
on
the
top
you
always
in
high
spirits
and
singing
each
your
own
family
ballad
to
the
stars
as
you
came
back
in
the
dark
deary
me
it
s
a
change
of
times
now
lord
knows
what
rubbish
i
am
carting
here
come
from
nobody
guesses
where
they
fill
me
with
small
deer
these
negroes
bedouin
arabs
swashbucklers
adventurers
from
every
land
and
ragged
settlers
who
poison
me
with
their
pipes
and
all
jabbering
a
language
that
the
tower
of
babel
itself
could
make
nothing
of
and
furthermore
you
should
see
how
they
treat
me
i
mean
how
they
never
treat
me
never
a
brush
or
a
wash
they
begrudge
me
grease
for
my
axles
instead
of
my
good
fat
quiet
horses
of
other
days
little
arab
ponies
with
the
devil
in
their
frames
who
fight
and
bite
caper
as
they
run
like
so
many
goats
and
break
my
splatterboard
all
to
smithereens
with
their
lashing
out
behind
ouch
ouch
there
they
are
at
it
again
and
such
roads
just
here
it
is
bearable
because
we
are
near
the
governmental
headquarters
but
out
a
bit
there
s
nothing
monsieur
not
the
ghost
of
a
road
at
all
we
get
along
as
best
we
can
over
hill
and
dale
over
dwarf
palms
and
ne
er
a
fixed
change
of
horses
the
stopping
being
at
the
whim
of
the
guard
now
at
one
farm
again
at
another
somewhiles
this
rogue
goes
a
couple
of
leagues
out
of
the
way
to
have
a
glass
of
absinthe
or
champoreau
with
a
chum
after
which
crack
on
postillion
to
make
up
for
the
lost
time
though
the
sun
be
broiling
and
the
dust
scorching

on

catch
in
the
scrub
and
spill
over

we
catch

swamped

drown
but

then
in
the
evening
streaming
a
nice
thing
for
my
age
with
my
rheumatics
i
have
to
sleep
in
the
open
air
of
some
caravanseral
yard
open
to
all
the
winds
in
the
dead
o
night
jackals
and
hyaenas
come
sniffing
of
my
body
and
the
marauders
who
don
t
like
dews
get
into
my
compartment
to
keep
warm
such
is
the
life
i
lead
my
poor
monsieur
tartarin
and
that
i
shall
lead
to
the
day
when
burnt
up
by
the
sun
and
rotted
by
the
damp
nights
until
unable
to
do
anything
else
i
shall
fall
in
some
spot
of
bad
road
where
the
arabs
will
boil
their
kouskous
with
the
bones
of
my
old
carcass
blidah
blidah
called
out
the
guard
as
he
opened
the
door
ii
a
little
gentleman
drops
in
and
drops
upon
tartarin
vaguely
through
the
glass
tartarin
of
tarascon
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
but
pretty
town
regular
in
shape
surrounded
by
colonnades
and
planted
with
in
the
midst
of
which
what
seemed
toy
leaden
soldiers
were
going
through
the
morning
exercise
in
the
clear
roseate
mist
the
cafes
were
shedding
their
shutters
in
one
corner
there
was
a
vegetable
market
it
was
bewitching
but
it
did
not
smack
of
lions
yet
to
the
south
farther
to
the
south
muttered
the
good
old
desperado
sinking
back
in
his
corner
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
a
puff
of
fresh
air
rushed
in
bearing
upon
its
wings
in
the
perfume
of
the
a
little
person
in
a
brown
old
and
dry
wrinkled
and
formal
his
face
no
bigger
than
your
fist
his
neckcloth
of
black
silk
five
fingers
wide
a
notary
s
and
umbrella
the
very
picture
of
a
village
solicitor
on
perceiving
the
tarasconian
s
warlike
equipment
the
little
gentleman
who
was
seated
over
against
him
appeared
excessively
surprised
and
set
to
studying
him
with
burdensome
persistency
the
horses
were
taken
out
and
the
fresh
ones
put
in
whereupon
the
coach
started
off
again
the
little
weasel
still
gazed
at
tartarin
who
in
the
end
took
snuff
at
it
does
this
astonish
you
he
demanded
staring
the
little
gentleman
full
in
the
face
in
his
turn
oh
dear
no
it
only
annoys
me
responded
the
other
very
tranquilly
and
the
fact
is
that
with
his
revolvers
pair
of
guns
in
their
cases
and
not
to
speak
of
his
natural
corpulence
tartarin
of
tarascon
did
take
up
a
lot
of
room
the
little
gentleman
s
reply
angered
him
do
you
by
any
chance
fancy
that
i
am
going
with
your
umbrella
queried
the
great
man
haughtily
the
little
man
looked
at
his
umbrella
smiled
blandly
and
still
with
the
same
lack
of
emotion
inquired
oho
then
you
are
monsieur
tartarin
of
tarascon
in
uttering
these
words
the
dauntless
son
of
tarascon
shook
the
blue
tassel
of
his
fez
like
a
mane
through
the
vehicle
was
a
spell
of
stupefaction
the
trappist
brother
crossed
himself
the
dubious
women
uttered
little
screams
of
affright
and
the
orleansville
photographer
bent
over
towards
the
already
cherishing
the
unequalled
honour
of
taking
his
likeness
the
little
gentleman
though
was
not
awed
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
have
killed
many
lions
monsieur
tartarin
he
asked
very
quietly
the
tarasconian
received
his
charge
in
the
handsomest
manner
is
it
many
have
i
killed
monsieur
i
wish
you
had
only
as
many
hairs
on
your
head
as
i
have
killed
of
all
the
coach
laughed
on
observing
three
yellow
bristles
standing
up
on
the
little
gentleman
s
skull
in
his
turn
the
orleansville
photographer
struck
in
yours
must
be
a
terrible
profession
monsieur
tartarin
you
must
pass
some
ugly
moments
sometimes
i
have
heard
that
poor
monsieur
bombonnel
oh
yes
the
said
tartarin
rather
disdainfully
do
you
happen
to
be
acquainted
with
him
inquired
the
insignificant
person
eh
of
course
know
him
why
we
have
been
out
on
the
hunt
over
twenty
times
the
little
gentleman
smiled
so
you
also
hunt
panthers
monsieur
tartarin
he
asked
sometimes
just
for
pastime
said
the
fiery
tarasconian
but
he
added
as
he
tossed
his
head
with
a
heroic
movement
that
inflamed
the
hearts
of
the
two
sweethearts
of
the
regiment
that
s
not
worth
when
all
s
said
and
done
ventured
the
photographer
a
panther
is
nothing
but
a
big
right
you
are
said
tartarin
not
sorry
to
abate
the
celebrated
bombonnel
s
glory
a
little
particularly
in
the
presence
of
ladies
here
the
coach
stopped
the
conductor
came
to
open
the
door
and
addressed
the
insignificant
little
gentleman
most
respectfully
saying
we
have
arrived
the
little
gentleman
got
up
stepped
out
and
said
before
the
door
was
closed
again
will
you
allow
me
to
give
you
a
bit
of
advice
monsieur
tartarin
what
is
it
monsieur
faith
you
wear
the
look
of
a
good
sort
of
fellow
so
i
would
rather
than
not
let
you
have
it
get
you
back
quickly
to
tarascon
monsieur
tartarin
for
you
are
wasting
your
time
here
there
do
remain
a
few
panthers
in
the
colony
but
out
upon
the
big
cats
they
are
too
small
game
for
you
as
for
that
s
all
over
there
are
none
left
in
algeria
my
friend
chassaing
having
lately
knocked
over
the
upon
which
the
little
gentleman
saluted
closed
the
door
and
trotted
away
chuckling
with
his
and
umbrella
guard
asked
tartarin
screwing
up
his
face
contemptuously
who
under
the
sun
is
that
poor
little
mannikin
what
don
t
you
know
him
why
that
there
s
monsieur
bombonnel
iii
a
monastery
of
lions
at
milianah
tartarin
of
tarascon
alighted
leaving
the
to
continue
its
way
towards
the
south
two
days
rough
jolting
two
nights
spent
with
eyes
open
to
spy
out
of
window
if
there
were
not
discoverable
the
dread
figure
of
a
lion
in
the
fields
beyond
the
road
so
much
sleeplessness
well
deserved
some
hours
repose
besides
if
we
must
tell
everything
since
his
misadventure
with
bombonnel
the
outspoken
tartarin
felt
ill
at
ease
notwithstanding
his
weapons
his
terrifying
visage
and
his
red
cap
before
the
orleansville
photographer
and
the
two
ladies
fond
of
the
military
so
he
proceeded
through
the
broad
streets
of
milianah
full
of
fine
trees
and
fountains
but
whilst
looking
up
a
suitable
hotel
the
poor
fellow
could
not
help
musing
over
bombonnel
s
words
suppose
they
were
true
suppose
there
were
no
more
lions
in
algeria
what
would
be
the
good
then
of
so
much
running
about
and
fatigue
suddenly
at
the
turn
of
a
street
our
hero
found
himself
face
to
face
with
with
what
guess
a
donkey
of
course
a
donkey
a
splendid
lion
this
time
waiting
before
a
door
royally
sitting
up
on
his
with
his
tawny
mane
gleaming
in
the
sun
what
possessed
them
to
tell
me
that
there
were
no
more
of
them
exclaimed
the
tarasconian
as
he
made
a
backward
jump
on
hearing
this
outcry
the
lion
lowered
his
head
and
taking
up
in
his
mouth
a
wooden
bowl
that
was
before
him
on
the
footway
humbly
held
it
out
towards
tartarin
who
was
immovable
with
stupefaction
a
passing
arab
tossed
a
copper
into
the
bowl
and
the
lion
wagged
his
tail
thereupon
tartarin
understood
it
all
he
saw
what
emotion
had
prevented
him
previously
perceiving
that
the
crowd
was
gathered
around
a
poor
tame
blind
lion
and
that
two
stalwart
negroes
armed
with
staves
were
marching
him
through
the
town
as
a
savoyard
does
a
marmot
the
blood
of
tarascon
boiled
over
at
once
wretches
that
you
are
he
roared
in
a
voice
of
thunder
thus
to
debase
such
noble
beasts
springing
to
the
lion
he
wrenched
the
loathsome
bowl
from
between
his
royal
jaws
the
two
africans
believing
they
had
a
thief
to
contend
with
rushed
upon
the
foreigner
with
uplifted
cudgels
there
was
a
dreadful
conflict
the
blackamoors
smiting
the
women
screaming
and
the
youngsters
laughing
an
old
jew
cobbler
bleated
out
of
the
hollow
of
his
stall
dake
him
to
the
shustish
of
the
beace
the
lion
himself
in
his
dark
state
tried
to
roar
as
his
hapless
champion
after
a
desperate
struggle
rolled
on
the
ground
among
the
spilt
pence
and
the
sweepings
at
this
juncture
a
man
cleft
the
throng
made
the
negroes
stand
back
with
a
word
and
the
women
and
urchins
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
lifted
up
tartarin
brushed
him
down
shook
him
into
shape
and
sat
him
breathless
upon
a
what
prince
is
it
you
said
the
good
tartarin
rubbing
his
ribs
yes
indeed
it
is
i
my
valiant
friend
as
soon
as
your
letter
was
received
i
entrusted
baya
to
her
brother
hired
a
flew
fifty
leagues
as
fast
as
a
horse
could
go
and
here
i
am
just
in
time
to
snatch
you
from
the
brutality
of
these
ruffians
what
have
you
done
in
the
name
of
just
heaven
to
bring
this
ugly
trouble
upon
you
what
done
prince
it
was
too
much
for
me
to
see
this
unfortunate
lion
with
a
in
his
mouth
humiliated
conquered
buffeted
about
set
up
as
a
to
all
this
moslem
rabble
but
you
are
wrong
my
noble
friend
on
the
contrary
this
lion
is
an
object
of
respect
and
adoration
this
is
a
sacred
beast
who
belongs
to
a
great
monastery
of
lions
founded
three
hundred
years
ago
by
mahomet
ben
aouda
a
kind
of
fierce
and
forbidding
la
trappe
full
of
roarings
and
odours
where
strange
monks
rear
and
feed
lions
by
hundreds
and
send
them
out
all
over
northern
africa
accompanied
by
begging
brothers
the
alms
they
receive
serve
for
the
maintenance
of
the
monastery
and
its
mosques
and
the
two
negroes
showed
so
much
displeasure
just
now
because
it
was
their
conviction
that
the
lion
under
their
charge
would
forthwith
devour
them
if
a
single
penny
of
their
collection
were
lost
or
stolen
through
any
fault
of
on
hearing
this
incredible
and
yet
veracious
story
tartarin
of
tarascon
was
delighted
and
sniffed
the
air
noisily
what
pleases
me
in
this
he
remarked
as
the
summing
up
of
his
opinion
is
that
whether
monsieur
bombonnel
likes
it
or
not
there
are
still
lions
in
i
should
think
there
were
ejaculated
the
prince
enthusiastically
we
will
start
beating
up
the
shelliff
plain
and
you
will
see
lions
enough
what
prince
have
you
an
intention
to
go
too
of
course
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
leave
you
to
march
by
yourself
into
the
heart
of
africa
in
the
midst
of
ferocious
tribes
of
whose
languages
and
usages
you
are
ignorant
no
no
illustrious
tartarin
i
shall
quit
you
no
more
go
where
you
will
i
shall
make
one
of
the
o
prince
prince
the
beaming
tartarin
hugged
the
devoted
gregory
to
his
breast
at
the
proud
thought
of
his
going
to
have
a
foreign
prince
to
accompany
him
in
his
hunting
after
the
example
of
jules
gerard
bombonnel
and
other
famous
iv
the
caravan
on
the
march
leaving
milianah
at
the
earliest
hour
next
morning
the
intrepid
tartarin
and
the
no
less
intrepid
prince
gregory
descended
towards
the
shelliff
plain
through
a
delightful
gorge
shaded
with
jessamine
carouba
tuyas
and
wild
between
hedges
of
little
native
gardens
and
thousands
of
merry
lively
rills
which
scampered
down
from
rock
to
rock
with
a
singing
splash
a
bit
of
landscape
meet
for
the
lebanon
as
much
loaded
with
arms
as
the
great
tartarin
prince
gregory
had
over
and
above
that
donned
a
queer
but
magnificent
military
cap
all
covered
with
gold
lace
and
a
trimming
of
in
silver
cord
which
gave
his
highness
the
aspect
of
a
mexican
general
or
a
railway
on
the
banks
of
the
danube
this
plague
of
a
cap
much
puzzled
the
beholder
and
as
he
timidly
craved
some
explanation
the
prince
gravely
answered
it
is
a
kind
of
headgear
indispensable
for
travel
in
whilst
brightening
up
the
peak
with
a
sweep
of
his
sleeve
he
instructed
his
simple
companion
in
the
important
part
which
the
military
cap
plays
in
the
french
connection
with
the
arabs
and
the
terror
this
article
of
army
insignia
alone
has
the
privilege
of
inspiring
so
that
the
civil
service
has
been
obliged
to
put
all
its
employees
in
caps
from
the
to
the
to
govern
algeria
the
prince
is
still
speaking
there
is
no
need
of
a
strong
head
or
even
of
any
head
at
all
a
military
cap
does
it
alone
if
showy
and
belaced
and
shining
at
the
top
of
a
pole
like
gessler
s
thus
chatting
and
philosophising
the
caravan
proceeded
the
barefooted
porters
leaped
from
rock
to
rock
with
screams
the
guncases
clanked
and
the
guns
themselves
flashed
the
natives
who
were
passing
salaamed
to
the
ground
before
the
magic
cap
up
above
on
the
ramparts
of
milianah
the
head
of
the
arab
department
who
was
out
for
an
airing
with
his
wife
hearing
these
unusual
noises
and
seeing
the
weapons
gleam
between
the
branches
fancied
there
was
a
revolt
and
ordered
the
drawbridge
to
be
raised
the
general
alarm
to
be
sounded
and
the
whole
town
put
under
a
state
of
siege
a
capital
commencement
for
the
caravan
unfortunately
before
the
day
ended
things
went
wrong
of
the
black
one
was
doubled
up
with
atrocious
colics
from
having
eaten
the
diachylon
out
of
the
another
fell
on
the
roadside
dead
drunk
with
camphorated
brandy
the
third
carrier
of
the
deceived
by
the
gilding
on
the
clasps
into
the
persuasion
that
he
was
flying
with
the
treasures
of
mecca
ran
off
into
the
zaccar
on
his
best
legs
this
required
consideration
the
caravan
halted
and
held
a
council
in
the
broken
shadow
of
an
old
it
s
my
advice
that
we
turn
up
negro
porters
from
this
evening
forward
said
the
prince
trying
without
success
to
melt
a
cake
of
compressed
meat
in
an
improved
patent
there
is
haply
an
arab
trader
quite
near
here
the
best
thing
to
do
is
to
stop
there
and
buy
some
no
no
no
donkeys
quickly
interrupted
tartarin
becoming
quite
red
at
memory
of
noiraud
how
can
you
expect
he
added
hypocrite
that
he
was
that
such
little
beasts
could
carry
all
our
apparatus
the
prince
smiled
you
are
making
a
mistake
my
illustrious
friend
however
weakly
and
meagre
the
algerian
bourriquot
may
appear
to
you
he
has
solid
loins
he
must
have
them
so
to
support
all
that
he
does
just
ask
the
arabs
hark
to
how
they
explain
the
french
colonial
organisation
on
the
top
they
say
is
mossoo
the
governor
with
a
heavy
club
to
rap
the
staff
the
staff
for
revenge
canes
the
soldier
the
soldier
clubs
the
settler
and
he
hammers
the
arab
the
arab
smites
the
negro
the
negro
beats
the
jew
and
he
takes
it
out
of
the
donkey
the
poor
bourriquot
having
nobody
to
belabour
arches
up
his
back
and
bears
it
you
see
clearly
now
that
he
can
bear
your
all
the
same
remonstrated
tartarin
it
strikes
me
that
jackasses
will
not
chime
in
nicely
with
the
effect
of
our
caravan
i
want
something
more
oriental
for
instance
if
we
could
only
get
a
camel
as
many
as
you
like
said
his
highness
and
off
they
started
for
the
arab
mart
it
was
held
a
few
miles
away
on
the
banks
of
the
shelliff
there
were
five
or
six
thousand
arabs
in
tatters
here
grovelling
in
the
sunshine
and
noisily
trafficking
amid
jars
of
black
olives
pots
of
honey
bags
of
spices
and
great
heaps
of
cigars
huge
fires
were
roasting
whole
sheep
basted
with
butter
in
open
air
stark
naked
negroes
with
ruddy
arms
and
their
feet
in
gore
were
cutting
up
kids
hanging
from
crosspoles
with
small
knives
in
one
corner
under
a
tent
patched
with
a
thousand
colours
a
moorish
clerk
of
the
market
in
spectacles
scrawled
in
a
large
book
here
was
a
cluster
of
men
shouting
with
rage
it
was
a
game
set
on
a
and
kabyles
were
ready
to
cut
one
another
s
throats
over
it
yonder
were
laughs
and
contortions
of
delight
it
was
a
jew
trader
on
a
mule
drowning
in
the
shelliff
then
there
were
dogs
scorpions
ravens
and
flies
rather
flies
than
anything
else
but
a
plentiful
lack
of
camels
abounded
they
finally
unearthed
one
though
of
which
the
m
zabites
were
trying
to
get
rid
the
real
ship
of
the
desert
the
classical
standard
camel
bald
with
a
long
bedouin
head
and
its
hump
become
limp
in
consequence
of
unduly
long
fasts
hanging
melancholically
on
one
side
tartarin
considered
it
so
handsome
that
he
wanted
the
entire
party
to
get
upon
it
still
his
oriental
craze
the
beast
knelt
down
for
them
to
strap
on
the
boxes
the
prince
enthroned
himself
on
the
animal
s
neck
for
the
sake
of
the
greater
majesty
tartarin
got
them
to
hoist
him
on
the
top
of
the
hump
between
two
boxes
where
proud
and
cosily
settled
down
he
saluted
the
whole
market
with
a
lofty
wave
of
the
hand
and
gave
the
signal
of
departure
thunderation
if
the
people
of
tarascon
could
only
have
seen
him
the
camel
rose
straightened
up
its
long
knotty
legs
and
stepped
out
oh
stupor
at
the
end
of
a
few
strides
tartarin
felt
he
was
losing
colour
and
the
heroic
chechia
assumed
one
by
one
its
former
positions
in
the
days
of
sailing
in
the
zouave
this
devil
s
own
camel
pitched
and
tossed
like
a
frigate
prince
prince
gasped
tartarin
pallid
as
a
ghost
as
he
clung
to
the
dry
tuft
of
the
hump
prince
let
s
get
down
i
find
i
feel
that
i
get
off
or
i
shall
disgrace
a
deal
of
good
that
talk
was
the
camel
was
on
the
go
and
nothing
could
stop
it
behind
it
raced
four
thousand
barefooted
arabs
waving
their
hands
and
laughing
like
mad
so
that
they
made
six
hundred
thousand
white
teeth
glitter
in
the
sun
the
great
man
of
tarascon
had
to
resign
himself
to
circumstances
he
sadly
collapsed
on
the
hump
where
the
fez
took
all
the
positions
it
fancied
and
france
was
disgraced
the
in
a
grove
sweetly
picturesque
as
was
their
new
steed
our
had
to
give
it
up
purely
out
of
consideration
for
the
red
cap
of
course
so
they
continued
the
journey
on
foot
as
before
the
caravan
tranquilly
proceeding
southwardly
by
short
stages
the
tarasconian
in
the
van
the
montenegrin
in
the
rear
and
the
camel
with
the
weapons
in
their
cases
in
the
ranks
the
expedition
lasted
nearly
a
month
during
that
seeking
for
lions
which
he
never
found
the
dreadful
tartarin
roamed
from
douar
to
douar
on
the
immense
plain
of
the
shelliff
through
the
odd
but
formidable
french
algeria
where
the
old
oriental
perfumes
are
complicated
by
a
strong
blend
of
absinthe
and
the
barracks
abraham
and
the
zouzou
mingled
something
and
simply
burlesque
like
a
page
of
the
old
testament
related
by
tommy
atkins
a
curious
sight
for
those
who
have
eyes
that
can
see
a
wild
and
corrupted
people
whom
we
are
civilising
by
teaching
them
our
vices
the
ferocious
and
uncontrolled
authority
of
grotesque
bashaws
who
gravely
use
their
grand
cordons
of
the
legion
of
honour
as
handkerchiefs
and
for
a
mere
yea
or
nay
order
a
man
to
be
bastinadoed
it
is
the
justice
of
the
conscienceless
bespectacled
cadis
under
the
of
the
koran
and
law
who
dream
languidly
of
promotion
and
sell
their
decrees
as
esau
did
his
birthright
for
a
dish
of
lentils
or
sweetened
kouskous
drunken
and
libertine
cadis
are
they
formerly
servants
to
some
general
yusuf
or
the
like
who
get
intoxicated
on
champagne
along
with
laundresses
from
port
mahon
and
fatten
on
roast
mutton
whilst
before
their
tents
the
whole
tribe
waste
away
with
hunger
and
fight
with
the
harriers
for
the
bones
of
the
lordly
feast
all
around
spread
the
plains
in
waste
burnt
grass
leafless
shrubs
thickets
of
cactus
and
mastic
the
granary
of
france
a
granary
void
of
grain
alas
and
rich
alone
in
vermin
and
jackals
abandoned
camps
frightened
tribes
fleeing
from
them
and
famine
they
know
not
whither
and
strewing
the
road
with
corpses
at
long
intervals
french
villages
with
the
dwellings
in
ruins
the
fields
untilled
the
maddened
locusts
gnawing
even
the
and
all
the
settlers
in
the
absorbing
absinthe
and
discussing
projects
of
reform
and
the
constitution
this
is
what
tartarin
might
have
seen
had
he
given
himself
the
trouble
but
wrapped
up
entirely
in
his
the
son
of
tarascon
went
straight
on
looking
to
neither
right
nor
left
his
eyes
steadfastly
fixed
on
the
imaginary
monsters
which
never
really
appeared
as
the
was
stubborn
in
not
unfolding
and
the
compressed
would
not
dissolve
the
caravan
was
obliged
to
stop
morn
and
eve
at
tribal
camps
everywhere
thanks
to
the
gorgeous
cap
of
prince
gregory
our
hunters
were
welcomed
with
open
arms
they
lodged
in
the
aghas
odd
palaces
large
white
windowless
farmhouses
where
they
found
narghilehs
and
mahogany
furniture
smyrna
carpets
and
moderator
lamps
cedar
coffers
full
of
turkish
sequins
and
french
clocks
in
the
louis
philippe
style
everywhere
too
tartarin
was
given
splendrous
galas
diffas
and
fantasias
which
being
interpreted
mean
feasts
and
circuses
in
his
honour
whole
goums
blazed
away
powder
and
floated
their
burnouses
in
the
sun
when
the
powder
was
burnt
the
agha
would
come
and
hand
in
his
bill
this
is
what
is
called
arab
hospitality
but
always
no
lions
no
more
than
on
london
bridge
nevertheless
the
tarasconian
did
not
grow
disheartened
ever
bravely
diving
more
deeply
into
the
south
he
spent
the
days
in
beating
up
the
thickets
probing
the
with
the
muzzle
of
his
rifle
and
saying
boh
to
every
bush
and
every
evening
before
lying
down
he
went
into
ambush
for
two
or
three
hours
useless
trouble
however
for
the
lion
did
not
show
himself
one
evening
though
going
on
six
o
clock
as
the
caravan
scrambled
through
a
where
fat
quails
tumbled
about
in
the
grass
drowsy
through
the
heat
tartarin
of
tarascon
fancied
he
heard
though
afar
and
very
vague
and
thinned
down
by
the
breeze
that
wondrous
roaring
to
which
he
had
so
often
listened
by
mitaine
s
menagerie
at
home
at
first
the
hero
feared
he
was
dreaming
but
in
an
instant
further
the
roaring
recommenced
more
distinct
although
yet
remote
and
this
time
the
camel
s
hump
shivered
in
terror
and
made
the
tinned
meats
and
arms
in
the
cases
rattle
whilst
all
the
dogs
in
the
camps
were
heard
howling
in
every
corner
of
the
horizon
beyond
doubt
this
was
the
lion
quick
quick
to
the
ambush
there
was
not
a
minute
to
lose
near
at
hand
there
happened
to
be
an
old
marabout
s
or
saint
s
tomb
with
a
white
cupola
and
the
defunct
s
large
yellow
slippers
placed
in
a
niche
over
the
door
and
a
mass
of
odd
offerings
hems
of
blankets
gold
thread
red
hair
hung
on
the
wall
tartarin
of
tarascon
left
his
prince
and
his
camel
and
went
in
search
of
a
good
spot
for
lying
in
wait
prince
gregory
wanted
to
follow
him
but
the
tarasconian
refused
bent
on
confronting
leo
alone
but
still
he
besought
his
highness
not
to
go
too
far
away
and
as
a
measure
of
foresight
he
entrusted
him
with
his
a
one
full
of
precious
papers
and
which
he
feared
would
get
torn
by
the
lion
s
claws
this
done
our
hero
looked
up
a
good
place
a
hundred
steps
in
front
of
the
temple
a
little
clump
of
shook
in
the
twilight
haze
on
the
edge
of
a
rivulet
all
but
dried
up
there
it
was
that
tartarin
went
and
ensconced
himself
one
knee
on
the
ground
according
to
the
regular
rule
his
rifle
in
his
hand
and
his
huge
stuck
boldly
before
him
in
the
sandy
bank
night
fell
the
rosy
tint
of
nature
changed
into
violet
and
then
into
dark
blue
a
pretty
pool
of
clear
water
gleamed
like
a
over
the
this
was
the
of
the
wild
animals
on
the
other
slope
the
whitish
trail
was
dimly
to
be
discerned
which
their
heavy
paws
had
traced
in
the
brush
a
mysterious
path
which
made
one
s
flesh
creep
join
to
this
sensation
that
from
the
vague
swarming
sound
in
african
forests
the
swishing
of
branches
the
of
roving
creatures
the
jackal
s
shrill
yelp
and
up
in
the
sky
two
or
three
hundred
feet
aloft
vast
flocks
of
cranes
passing
on
with
screams
like
poor
little
children
having
their
weasands
slit
you
will
own
that
there
were
grounds
for
a
man
being
moved
tartarin
was
so
and
even
more
than
that
for
the
poor
fellow
s
teeth
chattered
and
on
the
of
his
planted
upright
in
the
bank
as
we
repeat
his
rattled
like
a
pair
of
castanets
do
not
ask
too
much
of
a
man
there
are
times
when
one
is
not
in
the
mood
and
moreover
where
would
be
the
merit
if
heroes
were
never
afraid
well
yes
tartarin
was
afraid
and
all
the
time
too
for
the
matter
of
that
nevertheless
he
held
out
for
an
hour
better
for
two
but
heroism
has
its
limits
nigh
him
in
the
dry
part
of
the
the
tarasconian
unexpectedly
heard
the
sound
of
steps
and
of
pebbles
rolling
this
time
terror
lifted
him
off
the
ground
he
banged
away
both
barrels
at
haphazard
into
the
night
and
retreated
as
fast
as
his
legs
would
carry
him
to
the
marabout
s
leaving
his
knife
standing
up
in
the
sand
like
a
cross
commemorative
of
the
grandest
panic
that
ever
assailed
the
soul
of
a
conqueror
of
hydras
help
this
way
prince
the
lion
is
on
me
there
was
silence
prince
prince
are
you
there
the
prince
was
not
there
on
the
white
moonlit
wall
of
the
fane
the
camel
alone
cast
the
shadow
of
his
protuberance
prince
gregory
had
cut
and
run
with
the
wallet
of
his
highness
had
been
for
the
month
past
awaiting
this
opportunity
vi
bagged
him
at
last
it
was
not
until
early
on
the
morrow
of
this
adventurous
and
dramatic
eve
that
our
hero
awoke
and
acquired
assurance
doubly
sure
that
the
prince
and
the
treasure
had
really
gone
off
without
any
prospect
of
return
when
he
saw
himself
alone
in
the
little
white
tombhouse
betrayed
robbed
abandoned
in
the
heart
of
savage
algeria
with
a
camel
and
some
as
all
his
resources
then
did
the
representative
of
tarascon
for
the
first
time
doubt
he
doubted
montenegro
friendship
glory
and
even
lions
and
the
great
man
blubbered
bitterly
whilst
he
was
pensively
seated
on
the
sill
of
the
sanctuary
holding
his
head
between
his
hands
and
his
gun
between
his
legs
with
the
camel
mooning
at
him
the
thicket
over
the
way
was
divided
and
the
tartarin
saw
a
gigantic
lion
appear
not
a
dozen
paces
off
it
thrust
out
its
high
head
and
emitted
powerful
roars
which
made
the
temple
walls
shake
beneath
their
votive
decorations
and
even
the
saint
s
slippers
dance
in
their
niche
the
tarasconian
alone
did
not
tremble
at
last
you
ve
come
he
shouted
jumping
up
and
levelling
the
rifle
bang
bang
went
a
brace
of
shells
into
its
head
it
was
done
for
a
minute
on
the
fiery
background
of
the
african
sky
there
was
a
dreadful
firework
display
of
scattered
brains
smoking
blood
and
tawny
hair
when
all
fell
tartarin
perceived
two
colossal
negroes
furiously
running
towards
him
brandishing
cudgels
they
were
his
two
negro
acquaintances
of
milianah
oh
misery
this
was
the
domesticated
lion
the
poor
blind
beggar
of
the
mohammed
monastery
whom
the
tarasconian
s
bullets
had
knocked
over
this
time
spite
of
mahound
tartarin
escaped
neatly
drunk
with
fanatical
fury
the
two
african
collectors
would
have
surely
beaten
him
to
pulp
had
not
the
god
of
chase
and
war
sent
him
a
delivering
angel
in
the
shape
of
the
rural
constable
of
the
orleansville
commune
by
a
bypath
this
garde
champetre
came
up
his
sword
tucked
under
his
arm
the
sight
of
the
municipal
cap
suddenly
calmed
the
negroes
choler
peaceful
and
majestic
the
officer
with
the
brass
badge
drew
up
a
report
on
the
affair
ordered
the
camel
to
be
loaded
with
what
remained
of
the
king
of
beasts
and
the
plaintiffs
as
well
as
the
delinquent
to
follow
him
proceeding
to
orleansville
where
all
was
deposited
with
the
receiver
there
issued
a
long
and
alarming
case
after
the
algeria
of
the
native
tribes
which
he
had
overrun
tartarin
of
tarascon
became
thence
acquainted
with
another
algeria
not
less
weird
and
to
be
dreaded
the
algeria
in
the
towns
surcharged
with
lawyers
and
their
papers
he
got
to
know
the
pettifogger
who
does
business
at
the
back
of
a
cafe
the
legal
bohemian
with
documents
reeking
of
wormwood
bitters
and
white
neckcloths
spotted
with
champoreau
the
ushers
the
attorneys
all
the
locusts
of
stamped
paper
meagre
and
famished
who
eat
up
the
colonist
body
and
boots
ay
to
the
very
straps
of
them
and
leave
him
peeled
to
the
core
like
an
indian
cornstalk
stripped
leaf
by
leaf
before
all
else
it
was
necessary
to
ascertain
whether
the
lion
had
been
killed
on
the
civil
or
the
military
territory
in
the
former
case
the
matter
regarded
the
tribunal
of
commerce
in
the
second
tartarin
would
be
dealt
with
by
the
council
of
war
and
at
the
mere
name
the
impressionable
tarasconian
saw
himself
shot
at
the
foot
of
the
ramparts
or
huddled
up
in
a
the
puzzle
lay
in
the
limitation
of
the
two
territories
being
very
hazy
in
algeria
at
length
after
a
month
s
running
about
entanglements
and
waiting
under
the
sun
in
the
yards
of
arab
departmental
offices
it
was
established
that
whereas
the
lion
had
been
killed
on
the
military
territory
on
the
other
hand
tartarin
was
in
the
civil
territory
when
he
shot
so
the
case
was
decided
in
the
civil
courts
and
our
hero
was
let
off
on
paying
two
thousand
five
hundred
francs
damages
costs
not
included
how
could
he
pay
such
a
sum
the
few
piashtres
escaped
from
the
prince
s
sweep
had
long
since
gone
in
legal
documents
and
judicial
libations
the
unfortunate
was
therefore
reduced
to
selling
the
store
of
guns
by
retail
rifle
by
rifle
so
went
the
daggers
the
malay
kreeses
and
the
a
grocer
purchased
the
preserved
aliments
an
apothecary
what
remained
of
the
medicaments
the
big
boots
themselves
walked
off
after
the
improved
tent
to
a
dealer
of
curiosities
who
elevated
them
to
the
dignity
of
rarities
from
when
everything
was
paid
up
only
the
lion
s
skin
and
the
camel
remained
to
tartarin
the
hide
he
had
carefully
packed
to
be
sent
to
tarascon
to
the
address
of
brave
commandant
bravida
and
later
on
we
shall
see
what
came
of
this
fabulous
trophy
as
for
the
camel
he
reckoned
on
making
use
of
him
to
get
back
to
algiers
not
by
riding
on
him
but
by
selling
him
to
pay
his
the
best
way
to
employ
a
camel
in
travelling
unhappily
the
beast
was
difficult
to
place
and
no
one
would
offer
a
copper
for
him
still
tartarin
wanted
to
regain
algiers
by
hook
or
crook
he
was
in
haste
again
to
behold
baya
s
blue
bodice
his
little
snuggery
and
his
fountains
as
well
as
to
repose
on
the
white
trefoils
of
his
little
cloister
whilst
awaiting
money
from
france
so
our
hero
did
not
hesitate
distressed
but
not
downcast
he
undertook
to
make
the
journey
afoot
and
penniless
by
short
stages
in
this
enterprise
the
camel
did
not
cast
him
off
the
strange
animal
had
taken
an
unaccountable
fancy
for
his
master
and
on
seeing
him
leave
orleansville
he
set
to
striding
steadfastly
behind
him
regulating
his
pace
by
this
and
never
quitting
him
by
a
yard
at
the
first
outset
tartarin
found
this
touching
such
fidelity
and
devotion
above
proof
went
to
his
heart
all
the
more
because
the
creature
was
accommodating
and
fed
himself
on
nothing
nevertheless
after
a
few
days
the
tarasconian
was
worried
by
having
this
glum
companion
perpetually
at
his
heels
to
remind
him
of
his
misadventures
ire
arising
he
hated
him
for
his
sad
aspect
hump
and
gait
of
a
goose
in
harness
to
tell
the
whole
truth
he
held
him
as
his
old
man
of
the
sea
and
only
pondered
on
how
to
shake
him
off
but
the
follower
would
not
be
shaken
off
tartarin
attempted
to
lose
him
but
the
camel
always
found
him
he
tried
to
outrun
him
but
the
camel
ran
faster
he
bade
him
begone
and
hurled
stones
at
him
the
camel
stopped
with
a
mournful
mien
but
in
a
minute
resumed
the
pursuit
and
always
ended
by
overtaking
him
tartarin
had
to
resign
himself
for
all
that
when
after
eight
full
days
of
tramping
the
dusty
and
harassed
tarasconian
espied
the
first
white
housetops
of
algiers
glimmer
from
afar
in
the
verdure
and
when
he
got
to
the
city
gates
on
the
noisy
mustapha
avenue
amid
the
zouaves
biskris
and
mahonnais
all
swarming
around
him
and
staring
at
him
trudging
by
with
his
camel
overtasked
patience
escaped
him
no
no
he
growled
it
is
not
likely
i
can
not
enter
algiers
with
such
an
animal
profiting
by
a
jam
of
vehicles
he
turned
off
into
the
fields
and
jumped
into
a
ditch
in
a
minute
or
so
he
saw
over
his
head
on
the
highway
the
camel
flying
off
with
long
strides
and
stretching
his
neck
with
a
wistful
air
relieved
of
a
great
weight
thereby
the
hero
sneaked
out
of
his
covert
and
entered
the
town
anew
by
a
circuitous
path
which
skirted
the
wall
of
his
own
little
garden
vii
catastrophes
upon
catastrophes
entirely
astonished
was
tartarin
before
his
moorish
dwelling
when
he
stopped
day
was
dying
and
the
street
deserted
through
the
low
doorway
which
the
negress
had
forgotten
to
close
laughter
was
heard
and
the
clink
of
the
popping
of
champagne
corks
and
floating
over
all
the
jolly
uproar
a
feminine
voice
singing
clearly
and
joyously
do
you
like
marco
la
bella
to
dance
in
the
hall
hung
with
bloom
throne
of
heaven
ejaculated
the
tarasconian
turning
pale
as
he
rushed
into
the
enclosure
hapless
tartarin
what
a
sight
awaited
him
beneath
the
arches
of
the
little
cloister
amongst
bottles
pastry
scattered
cushions
pipes
tambourines
and
guitars
baya
was
singing
marco
la
bella
with
a
ship
captain
s
cap
over
one
ear
she
had
on
no
blue
vest
or
bodice
indeed
her
only
wear
was
a
silvery
gauze
wrapper
and
full
pink
trousers
at
her
feet
on
a
rug
surfeited
with
love
and
sweetmeats
barbassou
the
infamous
skipper
barbassou
was
bursting
with
laughter
at
hearing
her
the
apparition
of
tartarin
haggard
thinned
dusty
his
flaming
eyes
and
the
bristling
up
fez
tassel
sharply
interrupted
this
tender
orgie
baya
piped
the
low
whine
of
a
frightened
leveret
and
ran
for
safety
into
the
house
but
barbassou
did
not
wince
he
only
laughed
the
louder
saying
ha
ha
monsieur
tartarin
what
do
you
say
to
that
now
you
see
she
does
know
tartarin
of
tarascon
advanced
furiously
crying
captain
que
vengue
moun
bon
tell
him
what
s
happened
old
dear
screamed
the
moorish
woman
leaning
over
the
first
floor
gallery
with
a
pretty
gesture
the
poor
man
overwhelmed
let
himself
collapse
upon
a
drum
his
genuine
moorish
beauty
not
only
knew
french
but
the
french
of
marseilles
i
told
you
not
to
trust
the
algerian
girls
observed
captain
barbassou
sententiously
they
re
as
tricky
as
your
montenegrin
tartarin
lifted
his
head
do
you
know
where
the
prince
is
oh
he
s
not
far
off
he
has
gone
to
live
five
years
in
the
handsome
prison
of
mustapha
the
rogue
let
himself
be
caught
with
his
hand
in
the
pocket
anyways
this
is
not
the
first
time
he
has
been
clapped
into
the
calaboose
his
highness
has
already
done
three
years
somewhere
and
stop
a
bit
i
believe
it
was
at
at
tarascon
cried
out
her
worthiest
son
abruptly
enlightened
that
s
how
he
only
knew
one
part
of
the
hey
of
course
tarascon
a
jail
bird
view
from
the
state
prison
i
tell
you
my
poor
monsieur
tartarin
you
have
to
keep
your
peepers
jolly
well
skinned
in
this
deuce
of
a
country
or
be
exposed
to
very
disagreeable
things
for
a
sample
there
s
the
muezzin
s
game
with
what
game
which
muezzin
why
your
n
of
course
the
chap
across
the
way
who
is
making
up
to
baya
that
newspaper
the
akbar
told
the
yarn
t
other
day
and
all
algiers
is
laughing
over
it
even
now
it
is
so
funny
for
that
steeplejack
up
aloft
in
his
crow
to
make
declarations
of
love
under
your
very
nose
to
the
little
beauty
whilst
singing
out
his
prayers
and
making
appointments
with
her
between
bits
of
the
why
then
they
re
all
scamps
in
this
country
howled
the
unlucky
tarasconian
barbassou
snapped
his
fingers
like
a
philosopher
my
dear
lad
you
know
these
new
countries
are
rum
but
anyhow
if
you
ll
believe
me
you
d
best
cut
back
to
tarascon
at
full
it
s
easy
to
say
cut
where
s
the
money
to
come
from
don
t
you
know
that
i
was
plucked
out
there
in
the
desert
what
does
that
matter
said
the
captain
merrily
the
zouave
sails
tomorrow
and
if
you
like
i
will
take
you
home
does
that
suit
you
mate
ay
then
all
goes
well
you
have
only
one
thing
to
do
there
are
some
bottles
of
fizz
left
and
half
the
pie
sit
you
down
and
pitch
in
without
any
after
the
minute
s
wavering
which
commanded
the
tarasconian
chose
his
course
manfully
down
he
sat
and
they
touched
glasses
baya
gliding
down
at
that
chink
sang
the
finale
of
marco
la
bella
and
the
jollification
was
prolonged
deep
into
the
night
about
with
a
light
head
but
a
heavy
foot
our
good
tarasconian
was
returning
from
seeing
his
friend
the
captain
off
when
in
passing
the
mosque
the
remembrance
of
his
muezzin
and
his
practical
jokes
made
him
laugh
and
instantly
a
capital
idea
of
revenge
flitted
through
his
brain
the
door
was
open
he
entered
threaded
long
corridors
hung
with
mats
mounted
and
kept
on
mounting
till
he
finally
found
himself
in
a
little
oratory
where
an
openwork
iron
lantern
swung
from
the
ceiling
and
embroidered
an
odd
pattern
in
shadows
upon
the
blanched
walls
there
sat
the
crier
on
a
divan
in
his
large
turban
and
white
pelisse
with
his
mostaganam
pipe
and
a
bumper
of
absinthe
before
him
which
he
whipped
up
in
the
orthodox
manner
whilst
awaiting
the
hour
to
call
true
believers
to
prayer
at
view
of
tartarin
he
dropped
his
pipe
in
terror
not
a
word
knave
said
the
tarasconian
full
of
his
project
quick
off
with
turban
and
coat
the
turkish
tremblingly
handed
over
his
outer
garments
as
he
would
have
done
with
anything
else
tartarin
donned
them
and
gravely
stepped
out
upon
the
minaret
platform
in
the
distance
the
sea
shone
the
white
roofs
glittered
in
the
moonbeams
on
the
sea
breeze
was
heard
the
strumming
of
a
few
belated
guitars
the
tarasconian
muezzin
gathered
himself
up
for
the
effort
during
a
space
and
then
raising
his
arms
he
set
to
chanting
in
a
very
shrill
voice
la
allah
il
allah
mahomet
is
an
old
humbug
the
orient
the
koran
bashaws
lions
moorish
beauties
they
are
all
not
worth
a
fly
s
skip
there
is
nothing
left
but
gammoners
long
live
tarascon
whilst
the
illustrious
tartarin
in
his
queer
jumbling
of
arabic
and
provencal
flung
his
mirthful
maledictions
to
the
four
quarters
sea
town
plain
and
mountain
the
clear
solemn
voices
of
the
other
muezzins
answered
him
taking
up
the
strain
from
minaret
to
minaret
and
the
believers
of
the
upper
town
devoutly
beat
their
bosoms
viii
tarascon
again
has
come
the
zouave
had
her
steam
up
ready
to
go
upon
the
balcony
of
the
valentin
cafe
high
above
the
officers
were
levelling
telescopes
and
with
the
colonel
at
their
head
looking
at
the
lucky
little
craft
that
was
going
back
to
france
this
is
the
main
distraction
of
the
staff
on
the
lower
level
the
roads
glittered
the
old
turkish
cannon
breaches
stuck
up
along
the
waterside
blazed
in
the
sun
the
passengers
hurried
biskris
and
mahonnais
piled
their
luggage
up
in
the
wherries
tartarin
of
tarascon
had
no
luggage
here
he
comes
down
the
rue
de
la
marine
through
the
little
market
full
of
bananas
and
melons
accompanied
by
his
friend
barbassou
the
hapless
tarasconian
left
on
the
moorish
strand
his
and
his
illusions
and
now
he
had
to
sail
for
tarascon
with
his
hands
in
his
otherwise
empty
pockets
he
had
barely
leaped
into
the
captain
s
cutter
before
a
breathless
beast
slid
down
from
the
heights
of
the
square
and
galloped
towards
him
it
was
the
faithful
camel
who
had
been
hunting
after
his
master
in
algiers
during
the
last
hours
on
seeing
him
tartarin
changed
countenance
and
feigned
not
to
know
him
but
the
camel
was
not
going
to
be
put
off
he
scampered
along
the
quay
he
whinnied
for
his
friend
and
regarded
him
with
affection
take
me
away
his
sad
eyes
seemed
to
say
take
me
away
in
your
ship
far
far
from
this
sham
arabia
this
ridiculous
land
of
the
east
full
of
locomotives
and
stage
coaches
where
a
camel
is
so
sorely
out
of
keeping
that
i
do
not
know
what
will
become
of
me
you
are
the
last
real
turk
and
i
am
the
last
camel
do
not
let
us
part
o
my
tartarin
is
that
camel
yours
the
captain
inquired
not
a
bit
of
it
replied
tartarin
who
shuddered
at
the
idea
of
entering
tarascon
with
that
ridiculous
escort
and
impudently
denying
the
companion
of
his
misfortunes
he
spurned
the
algerian
soil
with
his
foot
and
gave
the
cutter
the
start
the
camel
sniffed
of
the
water
extended
its
neck
cracked
its
joints
and
jumping
in
behind
the
at
haphazard
he
swam
towards
the
zouave
with
his
humpback
floating
like
a
bladder
and
his
long
neck
projecting
over
the
wave
like
the
beak
of
a
galley
cutter
and
camel
came
alongside
the
mail
steamer
together
this
dromedary
regularly
cuts
me
up
observed
captain
barbassou
quite
affected
i
have
a
good
mind
to
take
him
aboard
and
make
a
present
of
him
to
the
zoological
gardens
at
and
so
they
hauled
up
the
camel
with
many
blocks
and
tackles
upon
the
deck
being
increased
in
weight
by
the
brine
and
the
zouave
started
tartarin
spent
the
two
days
of
the
crossing
by
himself
in
his
stateroom
not
because
the
sea
was
rough
or
that
the
red
fez
had
too
much
to
suffer
but
because
the
deuced
camel
as
soon
as
his
master
appeared
above
decks
showed
him
the
most
preposterous
attentions
you
never
did
see
a
camel
make
such
an
exhibition
of
a
man
as
this
from
hour
to
hour
through
the
cabin
portholes
where
he
stuck
out
his
nose
now
and
then
tartarin
saw
the
algerian
blue
sky
pale
away
until
one
morning
in
a
silvery
fog
he
heard
with
delight
marseilles
bells
ringing
out
the
zouave
had
arrived
and
cast
anchor
our
man
having
no
luggage
got
off
without
saying
anything
hastily
slipped
through
marseilles
for
fear
he
was
still
pursued
by
the
camel
and
never
breathed
till
he
was
in
a
carriage
making
for
tarascon
deceptive
security
hardly
were
they
two
leagues
from
the
city
before
every
head
was
stuck
out
of
window
there
were
outcries
and
astonishment
tartarin
looked
in
his
turn
and
what
did
he
descry
the
camel
reader
the
inevitable
camel
racing
along
the
line
behind
the
train
and
keeping
up
with
it
the
dismayed
tartarin
drew
back
and
shut
his
eyes
after
this
disastrous
expedition
of
his
he
had
reckoned
on
slipping
into
his
house
incognito
but
the
presence
of
this
burdensome
quadruped
rendered
the
thing
impossible
what
kind
of
a
triumphal
entry
would
he
make
good
heavens
not
a
sou
not
a
lion
nothing
to
show
for
it
save
a
camel
tarascon
tarascon
he
was
obliged
to
get
down
o
amazement
scarce
had
the
hero
s
red
fez
popped
out
of
the
doorway
before
a
loud
shout
of
tartarin
for
ever
made
the
glazed
roof
of
the
railway
station
tremble
long
life
to
tartarin
the
and
out
burst
the
windings
of
horns
and
the
choruses
of
the
local
musical
societies
tartarin
felt
death
had
come
he
believed
in
a
hoax
but
no
all
tarascon
was
there
waving
their
hats
all
of
the
same
way
of
thinking
behold
the
brave
commandant
bravida
costecalde
the
armourer
the
chief
judge
the
chemist
and
the
whole
noble
corps
of
who
pressed
around
their
leader
and
carried
him
in
triumph
out
through
the
passages
singular
effects
of
the
mirage
the
hide
of
the
blind
lion
sent
to
bravida
was
the
cause
of
all
this
riot
with
that
humble
fur
exhibited
in
the
the
tarasconians
and
at
the
back
of
them
the
whole
south
of
france
had
grown
exalted
the
semaphore
newspaper
had
spoken
of
it
a
drama
had
been
invented
it
was
not
merely
a
solitary
lion
which
tartarin
had
slain
but
ten
nay
twenty
pooh
a
herd
of
lions
had
been
made
marmalade
of
hence
on
disembarking
at
marseilles
tartarin
was
already
celebrated
without
being
aware
of
it
and
an
enthusiastic
telegram
had
gone
on
before
him
by
two
hours
to
his
native
place
but
what
capped
the
climax
of
the
popular
gladness
was
to
see
a
fancifully
shaped
animal
covered
with
foam
and
dust
appear
behind
the
hero
and
stumble
down
the
station
stairs
tarascon
for
an
instant
believed
that
its
dragon
was
come
again
tartarin
set
his
at
ease
this
is
my
camel
he
said
already
feeling
the
influence
of
the
splendid
sun
of
tarascon
which
makes
people
tell
bouncers
unwittingly
he
added
as
he
fondled
the
camel
s
hump
it
is
a
noble
beast
it
saw
me
kill
all
my
lions
whereupon
he
familiarly
took
the
arm
of
the
commandant
who
was
red
with
pleasure
and
followed
by
his
camel
surrounded
by
the
acclaimed
by
all
the
population
he
placidly
proceeded
towards
the
baobab
villa
and
on
the
march
thus
commenced
the
account
of
his
mighty
hunting
once
upon
an
evening
